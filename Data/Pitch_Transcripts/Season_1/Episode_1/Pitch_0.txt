MY NAME IS TIFFANY KRUMINS.
I LIVE IN AUBURN, GEORGIA.
IT'S A TINY LITTLE TOWN
WITH ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE.
IT'S GOT ONE LIGHT.
(makes kissing noises)
I LOVE LIVING HERE
WITH MY FAMILY.
I AM A NANNY FOR A LITTLE BOY
NAMED GIBBY.
HERE'S GIBBY.
HE IS A BIG PART OF MY LIFE,
AND ACTUALLY ONE OF
THE BIGGEST INSPIRATIONS
FOR MY PRODUCT.
I'VE FOUND OVER THE YEARS
WORKING WITH KIDS,
AND NOW HAVING MY OWN,
THAT THERE'S LITTLE THINGS
THAT YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH,
UH, TO GET A KID TO DO
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO,
WHETHER IT BE CLEAN THEIR ROOM
OR, UH, TAKE MEDICINE
OR EAT THEIR PEAS.
(singsongy) OPEN WIDE!
(singsongy) OPEN WIDE!
YAY!
(Tiffany) I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA
WALK IN, AND THEY MAY THINK
THAT THIS GIRL IS FROM
SOME TINY LITTLE TOWN IN GEORGIA
AND DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING,
BUT I HAVE HOPE THAT THEY WILL
JUST BE BLOWN AWAY WITH MY IDEA.
UM, MY NAME IS TIFFANY KRUMINS.
I'M FROM AUBURN, GEORGIA,
A CITY YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF.
IT'S TINY. ABOUT A MILE WIDE,
IT HAS ONE LIGHT.
UM, BUT I HAVE
A GREAT IDEA FOR YOU,
AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL WANT
TO INVEST IN THAT.
UM, I'M ASKING YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN??
LADY AND GENTLEMEN??
UM, FOR A $50,000 INVESTMENT.
IN TURN, I'M OFFERING YOU
15% OF THE EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
FOR THE PAST
TWO AND A HALF YEARS,
I'VE WORKED WITH A LITTLE BOY
NAMED GIBBY.
AND, UM, I'M HIS NANNY.
HE HAS DOWN SYNDROME.
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
HE GETS EAR INFECTIONS A LOT.
IT CAME TIME TO TAKE OUT THAT
MEDICINE DROPPER EVERY TIME,
AND GIBBY WOULD GO FROM
ANGEL TO PRO WRESTLER.
I MEAN, HE JUST...
DID NOT LIKE THE PROCESS.
SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
THERE HAS TO BE
A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS.
SO I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU EMMY.
THIS IS HER.
YOU TAKE
THE MEDICINE DROPPER OUT,
YOU SUCK UP
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MEDICINE,
PUT IT BACK IN,
AND YOU WOULD APPROACH
YOUR KID AND YOU WOULD??
OR THE CHILD YOU'RE WATCHING,
AND YOU PRESS THE BUTTON...
THIS IS THE SAYING
I CAME UP WITH ON MY OWN.
SHE SAYS, "ONE, TWO, THREE.
OPEN WIDE."
AND THEN SHE TELLS HIM
A GOOD JOB.
AND AS YOU'RE DOING THAT,
YOU PRESS IT OUT IN THEIR MOUTH,
AND IT WORKS
EVERY SINGLE TIME.
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THEIR KID HATES,
THEY WILL OPEN THEIR MOUTH
AND SMILE, AND IT WILL WORK.
THIS IS A HOMEMADE PROTOTYPE,
AND I'D LIKE TO
HAND THESE OUT TO YOU GUYS.
IT'S ONLY FOR EAR DROPS? IT'S??
NO, S??UH, NO, SIR.
HE HAD EAR INFECTIONS, SO HE
HAD TO TAKE MEDICINE ORALLY.
OH, IT'S FOR ORAL...
YES, IT'S ALL FOR ORAL.
(Barbara) ANY MEDICATION.
BUT YOU COULD,
I GUESS, YEAH.
BUT DOESN'T THE CHILD
AT SOME POINT
LOOK AT THAT ELEPHANT
AND SAY,
"THAT ELEPHANT GIVES ME
A LOT OF BAD MEDICINE"
AND GET UNHAPPY WITH??
WELL, I HAD AN IDEA
ABOUT THAT.
DON'T GIVE HIM ONE.
(laughs)
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD
HAPPEN AFTER A WHILE?
THEY'D ASSOCIATE THIS SNOUT
WITH JUST A LOT
OF ILL?TASTING STUFF?
WELL, THEY ASSOCIATE IT ALREADY
WITH THE MEDICINE DROPPER,
SO I ASSUME NO.
I THINK THEY COULD
EVENTUALLY LIKE THIS.
AND IT'S NOT ILL?TASTING
ANYMORE. THEY FLAVOR IT.
THEY CAN MAKE IT CHERRY.
THEY CAN MAKE IT ALL??
IT'S NOT REALLY THE FLAVOR
SO MUCH. IT'S THE PROCESS.
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON THIS?
UH, NO, I DON'T.
NOT YET.
I DID A PATENT SEARCH,
BUT I NEVER GOT TO THE??
BUT NOBODY ELSE HAS PATENTED
ANYTHING SIMILAR?
NO. NO, NOTHING LIKE IT.
HAVE YOU LOOKED
INTO MOLDING THIS,
GETTING A MOLD MADE...
UM...
FOR??FOR THIS?
NO, I HAVEN'T,
BECAUSE LAST YEAR WHEN I WENT
FOR MY PATENT SEARCH,
THEY TOLD ME??
THEY RECOMMENDED NOT GOING TO
FACTORIES AND THAT KIND OF STUFF
BECAUSE I WOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE
TO TELL 'EM WHAT I'M MAKING.
RIGHT.
UM, SO TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
THIS IS THE POINT THAT I'M AT.
I KNOW I HAVE A GOOD IDEA.
I KNOW I'M A HARD WORKER.
I KNOW THAT IT WORKS.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO USE
THE $50,000 FOR?
UH, PATENT, AND HOPEFULLY
A WORKING PROTOTYPE.
HAVE YOU
TESTED THIS REPEATEDLY
AGAINST A CHILD'S INTEREST
IN IT, AGAIN AND AGAIN,
TO SEE IF THEY TIRE OF IT?
I FEEL LIKE I'VE TESTED IT
ON THE HARDEST CHILD
I COULD EVER TEST IT ON??
GIBBY, THE LITTLE BOY I??
I WORKED WITH.
LISTEN, FIRST OF ALL,
I JUST WANT TO SAY,
IT??IT WARMS MY HEART TO SEE
THAT YOU CARE SO MUCH,
BUT HOW DO I PERSONALLY
PROFIT FROM IT?
RIGHT. YOU COULD MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS.
BUT IT'S NOT A BUSINESS.
IT'S AN IDEA.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SELLING
THAT RIGHT THERE FOR ABOUT $10.
I TOTALLY BELIEVE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE MONEY WITH IT.
I'M SURE PEOPLE SAID THAT
TO YOU, THOUGH,
ABOUT YOUR COMPANY,
DIDN'T THEY?
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?
WHAT IF THIS ISN'T??
WHAT IF THIS IS A BRANCH??
I GOT DOWN LIKE A DOG
AND BIT THEIR ANKLES.
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT A??
A MEDICINE?SNORTING ELEPHANT.
IT HAS TO BE BIGGER.
IT HAS TO BE BIGGER.
IT'S GOTTA BE A BUSINESS.
IT CAN BE.
IT CAN BE ONE DAY.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
AND I WANT YOU
TO PROFIT FROM IT.
BUT IN MY MIND, THERE'S NO PLACE
FOR ME IN THIS EQUATION.
YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT
PUTTING YOUR MONEY UP.
NO, TIFFANY. I'M OUT.
BUT, TIFFANY, DO YOU
REALLY NEED MY $50,000?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHY?
IN ORDER TO DO THE THINGS
THAT I NEED TO DO NEXT??
THE PATENT, THE PROTOTYPE.
I THINK YOU COULD WALK IN
TO ONE OF THE BIG COMPANIES,
MAKE A SALES CALL,
GO THROUGH WHAT YOU DID HERE,
'CAUSE YOU DID A GREAT JOB
WITH IT, AND MAKE THE SALE,
AND WORK OUT A LICENSING DEAL,
AND YOU'RE DONE.
MAYBE. I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE THE IDEA. I LIKE YOU.
BUT IT'S AN ITEM.
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
I LOOK FOR THINGS THAT HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF A TRACK RECORD.
UM, YOU KNOW, BY THE TIME
YOU GET DONE TOOLING THIS
AND GETTING THE SAMPLES
AND THE MOLDS
AND THE ENGINEERING
AND THE PATENTS AND ALL OF THAT,
THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME
AND OBVIOUSLY SOME MONEY.
UM, ALTHOUGH I THINK
IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK,
I?I HAVE TO SAY, I'M OUT.
TIFFANY, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK UP...
BECAUSE I LOVE THIS IDEA.
OKAY.
AND AS MUCH AS I LIKE
THE PRODUCT, I LOVE YOU.
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE DEAL
IS IT'S TOO RICH.
15% FOR $50,000??
I'D HAVE TO, LIKE,
DREAM AT NIGHT
HOPING TO GET
MY MONEY BACK LONG?TERM.
BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO GIVE ME
THE MAJORITY SHARE
OF YOUR BUSINESS??
AND I'M A GOOD GUY
TO BE IN BUSINESS WITH??
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME 55%
OF YOUR BUSINESS...
(gasps)
I'D BE VERY HAPPY
TO HAND YOU OVER THAT $50,000.
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE LOVE?
I LOVE THIS LADY, BUT THE NUMBER
HAS GOTTA MAKE SENSE
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE LOVE?
SO THE NUMBERS FOR ME MAKE SENSE
AT THAT DIFFERENT POINT.
TIFFANY, I'VE MADE YOU
A GOOD OFFER, I REALLY BELIEVE.
A GENUINE OFFER.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?
DO YOU WANT IT?
TIFFANY...
YES.
I'VE MADE YOU A GOOD OFFER, I
REALLY BELIEVE. A GENUINE OFFER.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?
DO YOU WANT IT?
$50,000 FOR 55%.
IS THERE ANY WAY
TO TALK YOU DOWN?
I'M TRYING TO PLAY HARDBALL.
CAN YOU TELL?
AM I DOING A GOOD JOB?
(laughs)
NOT??NOT GOOD AT ALL.
I KNOW.
I'M NOT GOOD AT THAT.
WHICH IS WHAT YOUR CHARM IS,
BY THE WAY.
I'M NOT GOOD AT THAT.
WELL, I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY
THAT ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS
OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS
IS WHAT YOU ALL KNOW
AND WHERE YOU'VE BEEN,
HOW FAR YOU'VE GOTTEN,
THE CONNECTIONS YOU HAVE.
SO THAT TO ME MEANS, REALLY,
MORE THAN THE MONEY.
I MEAN, THERE'S WAYS
TO GET THE MONEY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?
DO YOU WANT IT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOUR OFFER.
I'M SO HAPPY. WE'RE GONNA
MAKE MONEY ON THIS TOGETHER.
ALL RIGHT. GREAT.
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE ME A LOT MORE
THAN THE GUYS. TRUST ME.
I AM. (laughs)
THEY WERE ACTUALLY ALL
VERY NICE TO ME, THOUGH, SO??
THEY'RE NICE, BUT THEY DIDN'T
GIVE YOU THE MONEY.
THEY DIDN'T, SO I GUESS THEY
WEREN'T TOO NICE, WERE THEY?
I'M VERY HAPPY.
JUST THE BEGINNING.
YES, IT IS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
REALLY. I KNOW THAT.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
(Barbara) THANK YOU.
(Robert) THAT WAS GREAT.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I LOVED ABOUT THIS GIRL?
SHE HAD GREAT PASSION,
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,
SHE REMINDED ME OF MYSELF.
I SAW MYSELF LOOKING AT HER.
THERE'S <i>NO WAY</i> THAT GIRL'S
NOT GONNA MAKE IT.
I'M EXCITED BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY.
HER MENTORSHIP IS GONNA BE
THE BEST PART.
