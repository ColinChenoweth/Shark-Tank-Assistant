SWEET POTATO PIE?
OKAY, WOULD YOU LIKE
ANYTHING ELSE?
THERE'S A BIG DEMAND
FOR OUR PIES,
ESPECIALLY THE LITTLE
SWEET POTATO PIE.
THE PEOPLE ARE LINED UP TODAY.
IT'S FREEZING OUTSIDE,
SO THEY WANT SOMETHING
WARM AND TASTY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
MAKING FRESH PIES.
WE ACTUALLY DO THAT. THESE ARE
RAW NORTH CAROLINA JUMBO YAMS.
WE PROCESS ANYWHERE FROM,
YOU KNOW,
5,000 TO 6,000 POUNDS
OF YAMS A WEEK.
WE'RE HERE AT THE PIE FACTORY.

WE SELL OVER 3,000 PIES A DAY,
ALL GOING THROUGH
THIS ONE OVEN.
(telephone rings)
GOOD AFTERNOON.
MR. TOD'S PIE FACTORY.
PIES ARE MY LIVELIHOOD. I MEAN,
THIS IS WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.
I TAKE IT VERY SERIOUS.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED,
I WAS EAGER, I WAS YOUNGER,
I MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS??
BAD DECISIONS
THAT COST ME EVERYTHING.
OKAY, HOW YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE?
I'VE SACRIFICED A WHOLE LOT.
I'M ON MY THIRD BANK LOAN.
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION ANYMORE.
SO I HAVE NO OTHER RESOURCES.
I'M JUST TAPPED OUT.
(woman) DO YOU HAVE
ANY COCONUT TODAY?
RIGHT NOW I JUST NEED
SOMEONE LIKE THE SHARKS
TO BELIEVE IN ME.
OKAY, MAN. GOOD SEEING YOU,

TOD, DON'T CRY ABOUT MONEY.
IT NEVER CRIES FOR YOU.
IT'S GONNA ALLOW US TO OPEN UP
A MR. TOD'S KIOSK
WITHIN THEIR STORE.
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE CHAIN?
McDONALD'S.
WHAT?! McDONALD'S?
THIS SWEET POTATO PIE
IS TO THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES
AND AFRICAN?AMERICAN COMMUNITY
WHAT THE BAGEL IS
TO THE SUBURBS.
FAST?FOOD CHAINS
LIKE McDONALD'S
DO THE MAJORITY OF THEIR
BUSINESS IN INNER?CITY MARKETS.
THEY NEED TO HAVE A PRODUCT
ON THEIR MENU BOARD
THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE PEOPLE
WHO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.
TOD, I LIKE YOU,
I?I LOVE THE STORY...
UH, BUT I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE YOU THE MONEY.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M NOT
GONNA GIVE YOU THE MONEY.
I'M AFRAID
IF I GIVE YOU THE MONEY,
YOU'RE GONNA
START CUTTING CORNERS
AND TRYING TO EXPAND TOO QUICKLY
AGAIN LIKE YOU DID BEFORE.
AND??AND I'M NOT SURE
THAT THIS BUSINESS
CAN BE RAMPED UP
BY AN INFUSION OF CASH.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
TOD, I WOULD WANT
51% OF YOUR COMPANY, MAYBE MORE.
I WOULD WHACK
THE STUFFED PIE GUY.
HE'S AN EX??
HE'S A COST I DON'T NEED.
AND I WOULD TRY
AND DRIVE MARGINS
JUST WHOLESALING ONE SKEW??
SWEET POTATO PIES.
YOUR SALES WOULD BE CUT IN HALF.
YOU'D MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY.
I DON'T GET EMOTIONAL ABOUT PIE.
I DON'T GET EMOTIONAL
ABOUT MONEY.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE MORE OF IT,
AND THAT'S HOW TO DO IT.
BUT IT DOESN'T FIT YOUR WORLD,
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
YOU KNOW, TOD, $460,000
FOR 10% GIVES YOU A...
(stammers)
ABOUT A $4.6?MILLION VALUE
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON??
ON YOUR BUSINESS,
AND THAT'S
A?A TREMENDOUS MULTIPLE.
SO ON THAT BASIS,
I'M OUT ALSO.
(mouths words)
BARBARA...
DAYMOND...
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
DAYMOND...
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
I'M NOT OUT,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO IN
FOR AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU NEED,
SO WHO DO WE HAVE LEFT?
HOW ABOUT YOU, DAYMOND?
CAN YOU COME IN WITH ME ON THIS?
BECAUSE CAN I TELL YOU? I LOVE
WHAT I HEAR. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN
THE SAME LESSON TWICE.
SO I'D LIKE TO GO IN FOR HALF,
BUT I NEED TWICE THE EQUITY.
230 I CAN GIVE YOU,
BUT I WANT 20% FOR THAT.
(Robert) DAYMOND?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS A?A VERY TOUGH
DECISION FOR ME TO MAKE
BECAUSE YOU REMIND ME OF ME.
BUT I WOULD NEED
50% OF THE COMPANY.
AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO GO IN
HALF, WE'LL GO HALF ON IT.
BUT I WOULD ALSO NEED
TO SEE ORDERS, REAL ORDERS.
BECAUSE HOW ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS
PAYING YOU AT THE MOMENT?
ON THE WHOLESALE SIDE,
IT'S MOSTLY, UH, CASH.
CASH CUSTOMERS.
THAT CASH, IN THIS??IN THIS
ECONOMY, IS GONNA DRY UP.
WELL, I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, SIR.
UH, YOU KNOW, I RECENTLY READ,
UH, AN ARTICLE IN A MAGAZINE,
AND IT TALKED ABOUT
THE SEVEN BEST INDUSTRIES
FOR THE RECESSION, AND ONE
OF THEM WAS COMFORT FOODS.
I'D LIKE TO SAY,
WHEN WE'RE NOT FEELING GOOD,
WE'RE FEELING A LITTLE DOWN,
YOU GO GET SOMETHING
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL
A LITTLE BETTER.
AND THAT'S
WHAT MR. TOD'S PIES DOES.
TOD, STOP FOR A SECOND.
WHO DOESN'T LOVE PIE?
STOP FOR A SECOND, 'CAUSE THIS
IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS.
YOU GOTTA REALLY THINK ABOUT
THIS, 'CAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE HERE
AND MAKE A MISTAKE.
YOU CAME IN HERE
ONLY READY TO GIVE UP 10%.
IF YOU ACCEPT THEIR OFFER,
YOU'LL BE GIVING UP
HALF OF YOUR COMPANY.
THINK ABOUT IT.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER,
IN EXCHANGE FOR ME
ACCEPTING THAT FORM??
IF YOU DO COUNTER,
I WILL COUNTER.
(Robert) OOH.
I LIKE THAT.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE PIES?
YEAH. SEE? ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THE OLD FUN, EMOTIONAL STUFF??
OUT THE WINDOW.
YOU??
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT MONEY??
NO EMOTIONS, NO TEARS,
JUST REALITY.
ARE YOU GONNA GIVE US
AN ANSWER?
YES OR NO?
I'LL TAKE IT.
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS, TOD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH.
THAT'S GREAT, TOD.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE SWEET POTATO,
BUT I'M HAPPY TO BE IN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU. MM.
ALL RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
MY PLEASURE.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, TOD.
(Robert) GOOD JOB, TOD.
(Tod) GOOD LUCK
TO YOU AS WELL. WHOO!
I STILL WHACK THE PIE GUY.
(laughs)
IT WAS TOUGH GIVING UP
HALF MY COMPANY,
BUT IT SAVED MY BUSINESS,
AND IT'S GONNA HELP
TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
AND I'M HERE TODAY
TO EXPLAIN THE IONIC EAR
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.
HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
I'M LOOKING FOR $1 MILLION
FOR A 15% OWNERSHIP STAKE
IN THE TECHNOLOGY.
OH, YEAH.
WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED
IS AN IMPLANTABLE
BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY.
IF YOU'VE EV??ARE ONE OF
THE 40% OF THE USERS
OF BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY
THAT CURRENTLY OWN IT,
YOU KNOW THAT JUST
THE NATURAL RHYTHM
WALKING MANY TIMES
AND PERSPIRATION??
THE TECHNOLOGY
WILL FALL OFF YOUR EAR.
IF YOU ANSWER THE CALL
TOO QUICKLY,
MANY TIMES
THE BLUETOOTH DEVICE
WILL BECOME DISLODGED.
I'M SORRY.
WHERE ARE YOU IMPLANTING THIS,
INTO A??INTO ANOTHER DEVICE?
WHAT ARE YOU
IMPLANTING THIS INTO?
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY GOING
INTO YOUR EAR.
(chuckles)
IN YOUR EAR HOW?
YOU'RE PUSHING IT IN?
IF I COULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION
TO THE FIRST SLIDE.
HERE IS
THE SURGERY LOCATIONS.
THIS IS JUST UNDERNEATH
THE EARLOBE.
THE SURGERY LOCATION?
THIS IS??
THIS IS SURGERY.
YOU WOULD BE
UNDER ANESTHESIA.
(laughs)
(Barbara) GOD.
(laughs)
YOU GUYS ARE SO CLOSED?MINDED.
PLEASE LET HIM FINISH.
(O'Leary) OKAY, OKAY.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
AT THE BASE OF THE DEVICE
IS A BATTERY.
WITHIN ITS CENTER
ARE BLUETOOTH ELECTRONICS.
AND AT ITS TIP,
A MICROPHONE, A SPEAKER
AND AN A. C. CHARGING PORT.
STOP RIGHT THERE.
THE CHARGE IS??
BACK TO SURGERY 101.
OKAY. SURE.
WE'RE VALUING THE BUSINESS
ON WHERE IT IS TODAY.
SO I'M??I'M OUT.
(Robert) BARBARA?
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
YOU'RE GONNA SUCCEED
AT YOUR BUSINESS
JUST AS YOU DID
THE FIRST BUSINESS.
BUT I THINK
YOU WANT US TO PAY NOW
WITH WHAT IT'S GONNA BE WORTH
FIVE YEARS OUT,
AND THAT'S A TALL ORDER.
NOBODY'S COMFORTABLE LIKE THAT.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.
I THINK YOU DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB
OF BEING CONFIDENT
WITHOUT BEING ARROGANT.
WHEN SOMEBODY INSULTS YOU,
YOU SHOULDN'T INSULT 'EM BACK,
BUT YOU SHOULD
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.
SO I LIKE THAT.
HERE'S MY PROBLEM??
YOU WANT TO USE $250,000
TO TAKE A RISK ON THE FOXES.
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
WELL, WHAT IF WE CAME
TO THE TABLE WITH??
HANG ON A SEC.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
LET'S GO 50/50 ON THE FOXES
AND GIVE ME 10%
FOR MY INVESTMENT.
IN TAKING FAITH IN YOU,
GIVE ME 10% OF THE HUNKS
FOR MY $250,000 ALSO.
INTERESTING STRUCTURE.
THAT IS A GREAT DEAL.
YEAH.
AND I AM A GREAT GUY.
SO YOU'RE SAYING $250,000
FOR 10%
OF COLLEGE HUNKS HAULING JUNK
AND 50% OF COLLEGE FOXES
PACKING BOXES?
THINK OF THE 10% IN THE HUNKS
AS MY COLLATERAL
IN CASE WE CRASH AND BURN
ON THE FOXES.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
