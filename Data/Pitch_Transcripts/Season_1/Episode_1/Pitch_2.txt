KEVIN'S WRONG.
IF YOU'RE EMOTIONAL
AND YOU'RE GREAT AT SOMETHING,
THE MONEY WILL FOLLOW.
YES.
I THINK YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS
FOR THE MONEY.
YOU DID THIS TO PROVE SOMETHING
AND YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE
YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.
LET THE GUY CRY ABOUT IT.
THE GUY LOVES WHAT HE DOES.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
MAKE NO MISTAKE.
I AM HERE TO MAKE MONEY.
I MIGHT BE A NICE GUY,
A LITTLE OVERWEIGHT,
BUT I'M A BUSINESSMAN, TOO.
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL
BUSINESS??WHOLESALE.
YOU DON'T SELL TO KIDS
ON THE STREET. WHY THE MASCOT?
WE TAKE THE PIE MAN
INTO THE SCHOOLS.
WE HAVE A PROGRAM??
PIES FOR GOOD GRADES.
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT
HAVE HELPED MAKE ME SUCCESSFUL
THE SECOND TIME AROUND.
THEY TOLD ME DON'T SPEND THAT
KIND OF MONEY ON THAT MASCOT.
AND IT'S??IT'S BEEN PHENOMENAL.
IT'S GIVEN ME MY MONEY BACK
A HUNDRED TIMES OVER.
DO YOU HAVE HARD?COPY ORDERS
WITH PEOPLE SAYING,
"HERE, HERE'S AN ORDER,"
THAT YOU CAN'T MEET
PRODUCTION ON?
WELL, THERE IS A VERY BIG
NATIONAL FAST?FOOD ACCOUNT.
MY NAME IS KEVIN FLANNERY.
I'M FROM CARY, NORTH CAROLINA,
AND MY PRODUCT IS WiSpots.
SO THIS IS MY HOME OFFICE,
WHICH DOUBLES
AS MY LITTLE GIRL'S PLAYROOM.
THIS IS WHERE I SPEND
THE BETTER PART OF MY DAY,
UH, MAKING THINGS HAPPEN.
I AM A FORMER MARINE. OR ONCE
A MARINE, ALWAYS A MARINE.
I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN WIRELESS
TECHNOLOGY FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS.
HEY, MARK.
IT'S KEVIN FLANNERY.
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CALL
AND LET YOU KNOW THAT, UH,
WE DECIDED THAT, UM, INVESTORS
CAN TAKE PARTIAL UNITS.
I LEFT MY PREVIOUS POSITION
SO I COULD PUT
ALL OF MY TIME, ENERGY
AND EFFORT INTO WiSpots.
HI, ANGEL.
I HAVE FUNDED MY BUSINESS
THROUGH, UM,
MORTGAGES ON MY HOME.
UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO
PUT IT UP FOR SALE
'CAUSE I JUST CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE TWO MORTGAGES
ON THE HOME NOW, WHICH??
IT HURTS, BECAUSE THAT WAS
MY DREAM HOME.
IT'S, UH, WHERE
MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WAS BORN,
UH... (clears throat)
I??IT GETS ME EMOTIONAL
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT.
DEAR LORD, GIVE US GRACE
FOR THIS WONDERFUL FOOD
WE ARE ABOUT TO RECEIVE. AMEN.
(all) AMEN.
(Kevin)
FAMILY IS EVERYTHING TO ME.
UM, I DIDN'T GROW UP
WITH FAMILY.
I BOUNCED AROUND
IN FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME
FOR THE BETTER PART
OF MY TEENAGE LIFE.
SO IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO BE A GOOD FATHER
AND TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY.
AND I DO ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE SURE MY FAMILY KNOWS
THAT I LOVE THEM
MORE THAN THE AIR I BREATHE
AND THAT I'M FIGHTING HARD
TO BUILD A FUTURE FOR THEM.
MY NAME IS KEVIN FLANNERY.
I'M THE PRESIDENT AND C. E. O.
AND FOUNDER OF WiSpots??
THE FUTURE OF WAITING PATIENTLY.
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR LETTING ME
TAKE A DIP IN YOUR TANK.
I HOPE YOU DON'T BITE.
(chuckles)
I'M HERE SEEKING
$1.2 MILLION IN FUNDING
FOR A 10% EQUITY POSITION
IN MY COMPANY.
WHOA.
YOU BETTER HAVE
A TON OF SALES.
OKAY.
WiSpots IS A BUSINESS??
AN INNOVATIVE BUSINESS MODEL??
THAT HAS SIX YEARS
OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
IN THE RETAIL, HEALTH CARE
AND MEDIA SPACE
ALREADY IN PLACE.
WHAT'S THE PRODUCT?
AS YOU SEE HERE, THIS IS
OUR PATIENT INTERACTION CENTER.
I'M SURE ALL OF YOU HAVE HAD
TO GO TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE,
AND YOU TAKE YOUR LOVED ONES
TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.
YOUR CHOICES HAVE BEEN
READ AN OLD MAGAZINE
OR WATCH SOME BORING CONTENT
ON A SCREEN.
WITH THE WiSpots
PATIENT INTERACTION CENTER,
PATIENTS CAN WALK IN,
PICK UP ANY ONE OF THE FIVE
WIRELESS WEB PADS
TAKE THEM BACK TO THEIR SEAT,
CHECK IN, FILL OUT SURVEYS,
SIGN UP FOR CLINICAL TRIALS,
REQUEST EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION,
SURF THE WEB,
CHECK AND SEND E?MAILS,
PLAY GAMES, ALL FOR FREE.
WHEN THEY'RE DONE,
THEY JUST PUT IT BACK IN THE??
IN THE CHARGING CRADLE.
AND IT PROVIDES A REVENUE SOURCE
FOR THE DOCTORS,
SO THE DOCTORS
WANT IT IN THERE.
OKAY, WE GET IT. WALK US
THROUGH THE ECONOMICS.
WHO PAYS FOR THIS
IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE?
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES,
MEDIA BUYERS AND ADVERTISERS.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO PUT
THAT TRAY WITH THESE SCREENS
IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE?
A LITTLE OVER 9 GRAND.
(Robert) WHEW.
$9,000.
MM?HMM.
WHERE DOES THE $9,000
COME FROM?
THE DOCTOR'S PAY FOR IT,
BUT IT'S A NO?RISK OPPORTUNITY.
THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA PAY FOR IT.
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA PAY FOR IT.
THEY ALREADY ARE. I'M GETTING
CONTRACTS IN PLACE AS WE SPEAK.
YOU??YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DO HAVE DOCTORS
THAT HAVE GIVEN YOU $9,000?
DOCTORS HAVE SIGNED CONTRACTS.
HERE'S THE CATCH??
IT'S THE CAPTIVE EYEBALLS THAT
THE MEDIA BUYERS WANT TO SEE.
YEAH, BUT GET BACK TO THE MONEY
BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
THE DOCTORS HAVE SIGNED
CONTRACTS FOR $9,000 EACH
CONTINGENT ON
YOU GETTING AD SALES?
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED.
THEY??THEY EITHER PAY UP FRONT
OR THEY PAY A LEASE FEE,
BUT THEY DON'T PAY US UNTIL
WE FILL X?NUMBER OF REAL??
AD REAL ESTATE.
KEVIN, IF YOU'RE FRUSTRATED
IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE...
MM?HMM.
AND YOUR TREE ISN'T THERE...
AND YOU WANT TO CHECK
YOUR E?MAIL, WHAT DO YOU DO?
IF YOU BROUGHT YOUR LAPTOP,
YOU CAN USE YOUR LAPTOP, BUT??
IS THERE ANOTHER DEVICE
THAT COULD ALLOW ME
TO TAKE MY E?MAIL WITH ME?
YES, AND??
I WONDER
IF ANYONE'S INVENTED THAT.
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT E?MAIL.
IT'S ABOUT CONTENT DELIVERY.
AND MOST DOCTOR'S OFFICES
NOW REQUIRE YOU
TO TURN YOUR PHONE OFF
WHEN YOU WALK IN THE DOOR.
NO WAY, MAN.
KEVIN, HAVE YOU PUT MONEY INTO
THIS ON YOUR OWN, OF YOUR MONEY?
I HAVE PUT OVER $550,000
OF MY OWN MONEY.
I'VE MORTGAGED MY HOME TWICE.
I'VE... (clears throat)
MORTGAGED MY HOME TWICE.
I'VE TAKEN MY KIDS'
COLLEGE FUNDS, MY 401(k),
ALL MY SAVINGS AND A MOUNTAIN
OF DEBT ON MY CREDIT CARDS.
(groans)
WOW.
(O'Leary) STOP RIGHT THERE.
I'M GONNA DO YOU A HUGE FAVOR.
HERE'S HOW I THINK
OF MY MONEY??SOLDIERS.
I SEND THEM OUT TO WAR
EVERY DAY.
I WANT THEM TO TAKE PRISONERS
AND COME HOME
SO THERE'S MORE OF THEM.
YOUR ARMY, EVERY SOLDIER DIES
THAT YOU SEND OUT EVERY DAY.
WHEN YOU HAVE NO SOLDIERS,
YOU'RE WIPED OUT.
THAT'S THE GAME OF LIFE.
STOP THIS MADNESS.
I AM SO OUT.
I'M THINKING
YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTAND??
I MEAN, IT??THE INTER??
IT'S NOT ABOUT E?MAIL.
WE'RE FULLY UNDERSTANDING.
I HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
WITH THE CONCEPT.
IF IT'S NOT ABOUT E?MAIL,
BECAUSE YOU COULD DO
E?MAILS WITH YOUR PHONE,
UM, IT'S ABOUT ADVERTISING.
BUT I'M NOT GONNA PICK THAT UP
JUST TO LOOK AT ADS.
I HAVE TO SAY, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO SAY,
I RESPECT YOUR ENORMOUS
COMMITMENT TO THIS IDEA,
THAT YOU'D GO AT SUCH RISK.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT TAKES
A LOT MORE COURAGE? QUITTING.
I'M OUT.
YOU'RE RISKING
YOUR CHILDREN'S COLLEGE
AND YOUR HOME
YOU'RE LIVING IN FOR THIS?
I CAME FROM NOTHING, AND I
WANT TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING.
YES, BUT YOU CAME
FROM NOTHING
AND YOU'RE MORTGAGING
WHAT YOU HAVE.
STOP. ANYWAY, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
KEVIN, I FEEL SO BAD FOR YOU.
MY MOM AND DAD AND I CAME??
WE'RE IMMIGRANTS TO THE COUNTRY.
WE CAME HERE WITH NOTHING
ON A BOAT.
I'LL TELL YOU, MY DAD'S
A FACTORY WORKER,
NEVER MADE ANY REAL MONEY, BUT I
LEARNED SOMETHING FROM HIM.
YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO SAVE YOUR MONEY
SO YOU DON'T PUT
YOUR FAMILY AT RISK.
YOU??YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY FIRST.
HERE'S BELIEF
AND HERE'S BEING A FOOL.
DON'T CROSS THAT LINE.
I'M OUT.
APPRECIATE
ALL YOUR OPINIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
GOD,
THAT WAS HEARTBREAKING.
THAT'S THE DARK SIDE.
THIS IS THE PROBLEM
WITH FALSE ENCOURAGEMENT.
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE
NEVER GET A CHANCE
TO MEET A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
WHO'VE DONE IT BEFORE
AND GET SOME REAL,
UNBIASED ADVICE.
OH, <i>OKAY.</i> SO...
UNCLE KEVIN'S OUT.
UNCLE DAYMOND?
I WOULD JUST BE UNEASY WITH,
UM, THE FACT OF YOUNG GIRLS,
UH, ME PROFITING OFF OF THAT,
BECAUSE I JUST FEEL, YOU KNOW,
THE CALLS WOULD BE A WHOLE BUNCH
OF GUYS IN TRENCH COATS.
(deep voice)
"HEY, I NEED TO MOVE AGAIN."
WE DON'T HAVE A S??
(normal voice) I'M OUT.
THESE GUYS
HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB
OF BUILDING THE BUSINESS
TO THIS POINT.
BUT THEY'RE VALUING
THEIR BUSINESS BASED ON
WHERE THEY'RE GONNA BE
IN THE FUTURE.
YES, EXACTLY.
