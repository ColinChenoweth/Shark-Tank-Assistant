HOW'S IT GOING?
MY NAME IS OMAR SOLIMAN.
THIS IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER
NICK FRIEDMAN.
AND OUR BUSINESS IS
COLLEGE FOXES PACKING BOXES??
THE EDUCATED CHOICE
IN PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZING,
MOVING PREPARATION
AND UNPACKING.
IMAGINE YOU WERE GETTING READY
TO MOVE FROM A HOUSE
YOU'VE LIVED IN FOR 30 YEARS.
YOU LITERALLY HAVE
A LIFETIME WORTH OF BELONGINGS
THAT YOU NEED PACKED, SORTED,
DECLUTTERED AND UNPACKED.
WHO WOULD YOU RATHER HANDLING
YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS??
THIS UNPROFESSIONAL,
UNLICENSED, UNINSURED MOVER
ENTHUSIASTIC COLLEGE FOXES
PACKING BOXES?
BUT, OMAR, THE PROBLEM IS,
WHO WOULD MY <i>WIFE</i>
WANT TO HAVE DO THE MOVING?
(sharks laugh)
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
WE'RE LOOKING FOR $250,000
FOR A 25% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
WHEN YOU INVEST IN A BUSINESS,
IT'S NOT JUST THE IDEA
YOU'RE INVESTING IN,
BUT THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE IDEA.
YOU WANT SOMEONE
THAT'S CUT FROM THE SAME
ENTREPRENEURIAL CLOTH AS YOU??
SAVVY, DRIVEN, A PROVEN WINNER.
OMAR AND I FOUNDED
OUR FIRST BUSINESS??
COLLEGE HUNKS HAULING JUNK??
WHICH IS NOW THE LARGEST
AND FASTEST?GROWING,
U.S.?BASED JUNK REMOVAL
FRANCHISE OPPORTUNITY.
"INC." MAGAZINE
RECENTLY NAMED OMAR AND I
TOP 30 ENTREPRENEURS
IN AMERICA UNDER 30...
WOW.
AND "ENTREPRENEUR" MAGAZINE
NAMED COLLEGE HUNKS HAULING JUNK
THE TOP 30 NEW FRANCHISE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR 2009.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
AND WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE
OUR ECONOMIES OF SCALE,
OUR SOFTWARE, OUR CALL CENTER,
OUR MARKETING PLAN,
OUR CLIENT BASE
AND OUR FRANCHISE PROGRAM
TO GROW COLLEGE FOXES
PACKING BOXES??
SO THE HUNK BUSINESS
IS NOT ON THE TABLE?
THE COLLEGE HUNKS
HAULING JUNK??
YOU HAVE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
RIGHT.
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO SELL ME THAT.
YOU WANT TO SELL ME
A NEW BUSINESS.
EXACT??WELL??
WHY WOULD I EVER
GIVE YOU DOLLARS
FOR ONE THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
IF IT'S GONNA WORK OR NOT
WITHOUT GETTING A PIECE
OF WHAT'S WORKING,
WHEN REALLY IT'S JUST
AN EXTENSION
OF SOMETHING
YOU'VE ALREADY BUILT?
WE'RE NOT IDIOTS UP HERE. AND IF
YOU WANT TO GET $250,000??
IS THAT THE NUMBER?
YES.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A HUGE PIECE
OF YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS.
ARE YOU GONNA WORK
IN THE FOX BUSINESS?
WE'RE GONNA HIRE A C. F. O.,
A CHIEF FOX OFFICER??
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY MONEY,
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PUT
YOUR ENERGY INTO THE HUNKS?
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BENEFIT??
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE
THE PEANUT BUTTER.
YOU'RE NOT GIVING US
THE JELLY.
YOU GOTTA PACKAGE
BOTH BUSINESSES.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
FOR COLLEGE HUNKS
HAULING JUNK
OR COLLEGE FOXES
PACKING BOXES?
FORGET FOXES.
THE ONE THAT'S WORKING.
WE NETTED
$500,000 LAST YEAR.
OOH.
(O'Leary) SALES.
WE HAD A PROFIT MARGIN
OF ABOUT 20%.
CA?CHING.
THIS IS WHY
WE GOTTA HAVE THE HUNKS.
HEY, THAT??THAT MAY NOT
SOUND RIGHT ON TV. HANG ON.
I THINK THE ATTRACTIVE THING
THAT YOU'VE OFFERED HERE
IS THAT YOU HAVE BUILT
THIS INF?INFRASTRUCTURE.
AND THE EXISTING SUCCESS
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY PROVEN??
IF YOU'RE GONNA LEVERAGE IT IN,
LET US HAVE
A PIECE OF THAT ALSO.
GUYS, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER RIGHT NOW.
I'LL DO 51% FOR 250K.
FOR WHAT?
THE EXISTING BUSINESS.
EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING.
(chuckles)
DON'T LAUGH SO FAST, BUDDY.
IT'S NOT EASY TO COME UP
WITH $250,000.
BE VERY CAREFUL. NEVER LAUGH
AT MONEY. THINK ABOUT THAT.
WHY DON'T YOU OFFER US
THE HUNKS AND THE FOXES
FOR A DOLLAR AMOUNT?
I'M SERIOUS.
WHY DON'T YOU START AGAIN?
GO BACK OUT AND START AGAIN.
COME BACK IN
AND MAKE US AN OFFER
ON THE OVERALL BUSINESS.
OKAY.
(Harrington)
THEY HAVE TO BE COMBINED.
IT'S GOTTA BE ONE BUSINESS.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THAT THE DEAL MAKES SENSE.
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T COME ON HERE
TO GIVE UP ANYTHING
OF COLLEGE HUNKS HAULING JUNK,
RIGHT?
RIGHT.
I MEAN, WE STARTED THAT FROM
SCRATCH WITH NO INVESTMENT.
THEY DON'T SEE
THAT A $250,000 INVESTMENT
CAN SPIN
COLLEGE FOXES PACKING BOXES
TO A 70?FRANCHISE OP??
LOCATION IN 2 YEARS?
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO
THROW OUT A NUMBER?
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A VERY VIABLE,
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS HERE
THAT WE JUST??
WE CAN'T SELL IT SHORT.
OKAY, GUYS,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
LOOK... WE BUILT
COLLEGE HUNKS HAULING JUNK
FROM A CARGO VAN
TO A $3?MILLION COMPANY
IN 3 YEARS.
WE PUT ALL OUR BLOOD, SWEAT
AND TEARS INTO THAT COMPANY.
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
SELL OURSELVES SHORT
FOR THAT AMOUNT THAT YOU OFF??
THAT YOU OFFERED OF $250,000.
YOU TAKE IT OR NOT?
THEY SAID NO.
WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?
OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?
THE OFFER'S $1 MILLION
FOR 10%.
WHAT?!
(sharks laugh)
ARE YOU GUYS OUT OF YOUR MINDS?
BEAR WITH ME.
GUYS, I WANT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW??
YOU WILL NEVER, EVER??
EITHER OF YOU??
GET TO THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE
DOING A DEAL LIKE THAT, EVER.
YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE WEARING THOSE TIES?
YOU'RE PIGS.
PIGS GET SLAUGHTERED.
YOU'RE ASKING
FOR A RIDICULOUS VALUATION.
CRAZY. INSANE. YOUR BUSINESS
ISN'T WORTH $10 MILLION.
IT'S WORTH MAYBE,
IF I'M BEING <i>REALLY</i> GENEROUS,
600K.
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
HOW CAN THAT BE??
HOW DO YOU GET THAT NUMBER?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
WE HAVE ONE LOCATION IN D. C.
THAT PROFITS $300,000 A YEAR.
I'M JUST
TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS.
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO GREEDY?
WE'RE NOT BEING GREEDY.
WE JUST??WE??WE JUST??
WHAT, DO YOU THINK I'M IDIOT?
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A $10?MILLION VALUATION?
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
IF YOU DON'T SEE??
NOW YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF.
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU STOP THIS
CRAP AND DEAL WITH REALITY?
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE WORTH $10 MILLION?
I?I BELIEVE THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH $10 MILLION.
I BELIEVE IN 5 YEARS,
THE BUSINESS WILL BE WORTH
$10 MILLION.
OH, I'M SO FRUSTRATED.
I'M SO UNHAPPY WITH YOU GUYS.
SO??
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU. SO THAT MEANS
YOU GET TO STOP TALKING, RIGHT?
THAT'S GOOD ATTITUDE.
THAT'S GOOD ATTITUDE.
(Robert) THAT IS??
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
NEVER INSULT MONEY.
OMAR, NICK... BAD MISTAKE.
I THINK WE'RE ALL OUT.
THANKS, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
(Harrington) GOOD LUCK
TO YOU GUYS.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
(Robert) TOO BAD.
I STILL LIKE THEM.
I LIKE 'EM A LOT.
THEY'RE HUSTLERS.
HE SHOULD'VE TAKEN MY OFFER.
MY OFFER WAS A GOOD OFFER.
YOU OVERPAID SO MUCH.
THAT'S WHAT KILLS ME.
HE DIDN'T SEE THE FACT
THAT I WAS WILLING TO OVERPAY
TO BE INVOLVED.
AND YET HE STILL SAID NO.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
IT TELLS ME I CAN BE
A REAL JERK LIKE YOU
AND STILL END UP
IN THE SAME PLACE WITH A NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
TELLING A GUY WHO'S A PIG
HE'S A PIG, AND HE'S A PIG.
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED
THE "SHARK TANK."
IT'S NOT CALLED
THE BUNNY TANK.
THEY SMELLED BLOOD IN THE WATER,
THEY SAW A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS,
AND THEY JUST JUMPED
ALL OVER IT.
UH, $9.50.
STOP THE MADNESS.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
(Daymond) $9.50 FOR ONE?
YES.
WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD BE
THE NEXT BIG BRAND.
I'M GETTING EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED
TO IT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF
THE BEST PRODUCTS
I'VE EVER SEEN.
AND I ALSO LOVE THE PRODUCT.
MY OFFER IS $500,000.
I'LL MAKE YOU A BETTER OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION.
YOU'VE SEEN A GUY
SCREW HIS PARTNERS,
AND I WON'T FORGET THIS,
ROBERT.
"OOH."
