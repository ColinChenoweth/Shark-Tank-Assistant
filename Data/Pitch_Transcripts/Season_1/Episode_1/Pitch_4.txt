MY NAME IS DARRIN JOHNSON,
DARRIN, WE'RE GONNA??
WE'RE GONNA OPERATE ON PEOPLE.
YES, WE ARE.
HUH.
WE'RE GONNA STICK SOMETHING
IN NEAR THEIR BRAIN.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE MAY NOT PUNCTURE
THEIR EAR??
YOU KNOW WHAT? I?I CAN SUM UP
WHERE I STAND ON THIS ALREADY.
IT'S PRETTY DISTURBING
AND IT FREAKS ME OUT.
I'M ALREADY OUT.
DARRIN, HOW DO I CHARGE IT
EVERY NIGHT?
SO WE HAVE THE??
THE A. C. CHARGING PORT.
(O'Leary) SO YOU STICK THAT
NEEDLE IN YOUR HEAD EVERY NIGHT
TO CHARGE IT?
YES, YOU WOULD.
OKAY, ONE LITTLE THING.
(Robert) WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA. HANG ON.
ARE YOU... SERIOUSLY?
LIKE, SERIOUSLY??A NEEDLE?
IT'S LIKE
A SMALL Q?TIP CYLINDER
THAT WOULD DOCK
WITH THE CHARGING PORT.
(Daymond laughs)
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU MISS, DARRIN?
THE TARGET'S BUILT
SO THAT YOU CAN'T MISS.
YOU CAN'T MISS? REALLY?
SURE. THERE'S GOING TO BE
SAFETY FEATURES BUILT INTO IT.
DARRIN, I NEED TO BE CLEAR
ON THIS BEFORE I WRITE YOU OFF
AS A NUT JOB,
WHICH I'M TRYING NOT TO DO.
OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT.
BUT I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND??
A TEAM OF DOCTORS IMPLANT IT
IN YOUR NECK BELOW YOUR EAR...
SURE.
AND THEN YOU STICK SOMETHING
IN YOUR EAR IN THE EVENING,
SOMETHING, WHAT, COMMENSURATE??
SOMETHING THAT'S THE SIZE
OF A Q?TIP OR SMALLER
TO CHARGE IT EVERY NIGHT?
SOMETHING THAT'S
THE SIZE OF A Q?TIP??
A CYLINDER THAT DELIVERS A. C.
CHARGE AT A VERY TRICKLE, LOW??
DARRIN, I'M OUT.
H?HOW DO I DO AN UPGRADE? I GO
BACK AND GET ANOTHER OPERATION?
WELL, YOU??YOU WOULD
HAVE TO GO IN
AND RECEIVE
AN ADDITIONAL OPERATION.
DO??DO YOU SEE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
SURE. THERE??THERE??
CERTAINLY, THERE IS ISSUES.
DARRIN, I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT. I AM OUT.
THIS IS THE WEIRDEST DAMN THING
I EVER HEARD.
OH.
THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU
HEARD OF BREAST IMPLANTS,
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
I LOVE IT.
RIGHT. OKAY.
(sharks laugh)
BUT AS A WOMAN??
AS A WOMAN, WOULD IT BE...
(man) BLUETOOTH BREASTS!
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD
IMMEDIATELY WANT TO DO?
OR WOULD IT TAKE MARKET
ACCEPTANCE AND A LOT OF TESTING
AND A LOT OF MEDICAL TRIALS
BEFORE PEOPLE ACCEPTED THE IDEA?
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. HAVE YOU
TOLD ANYBODY ELSE
EXCEPT US IN THE ROOM
ABOUT THIS?
YES, I HAVE.
AND YOU'RE STILL
WALKING AROUND FREE, I SEE.
SURE.
DON'T CALL ME.
I'LL CALL YOU. I'M OUT.
OKAY. APPRECIATE THAT.
DARRIN, HERE IS??
HERE IS INSANITY,
HERE IS GENIUS.
YOU'RE SOMEWHERE.
NEVERTHELESS, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
DID YOU SEE
THE SIZE OF THAT THING
THAT HE WANTED TO PUT
IN YOUR EAR?
ONE TIME IN THE SHOWER,
YOU'RE GONNA JUST SHORT OUT.
HE'S SO FAR AHEAD
OF HIS TIME.
THANK GOD I WON'T BE ALIVE
WHEN HIS TIME COMES.
YEP.
