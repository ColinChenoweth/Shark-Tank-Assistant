HI. MY NAME IS ALAN KAUFMAN.
I'M THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT
OF A COMPANY CALLED NUBRELLA.
I'M SEEKING
A $200,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 25% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU IS
A NEW, REVOLUTIONARY
UMBRELLA DESIGN.
WE ARE ALL WELL?FAMILIAR
WITH THE INVERTED
AND BREAKING UMBRELLA.
MY DESIGN INTRODUCES SOME NEW,
GAME?CHANGING INNOVATIONS
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
AN UMBRELLA CAN DO.
NUBRELLA IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO INVERT.
NUBRELLA WILL KEEP THE USER
SIGNIFICANTLY WARMER,
AS IT BLOCKS WIND CHILL.
AND I'VE SAVED THE BEST
FOR LAST.
NUBRELLA CAN BE USED
COMPLETELY HANDS?FREE,
EVEN IN SIGNIFICANT WINDS.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.
(Barbara) WOW.
(Robert) OH, I GOTTA SEE IT.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.
(sharks laughing)
AND THEN YOU WOULD
SIMPLY SNAP THIS IN HERE.
(laugh continues)
(Barbara)
OH, I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.
CAN I PLEASE TRY THAT?
ABSOLUTELY.
DO??DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE,
ALAN?
YES.
(Robert) CAN I TRY ONE?
(Alan) SURE.
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS REMINDS ME OF?
(as Marvin the Martian) "I'M
GOING TO DESTROY THE EARTH."
ALAN, WHAT DOES THAT WEIGH,
THAT UMBRELLA?
IT WEIGHS ABOUT 2.5 POUNDS...
BOOM!
BUT WHEN IT'S ON YOUR SHOULDERS,
YOU WON'T EVEN FEEL IT.
IT'S REALLY LIGHT. SO??
THAT IS SO FUNNY TO LOOK AT.
(Alan) IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S
UNIQUE. IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.
(Daymond) HELLO, BARBARA.
IT'S AN ATTENTION?GETTER,
FOR SURE.
HOW MANY HAVE
YOU SOLD SO FAR, ALAN?
I'VE SOLD 3,000.
HOW DO THEY FIND YOU TO BUY IT?
UH, THE MEDIA PICKED IT UP,
AND IT'S ALL OVER THE WORLD.
I GET CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY,
AND I'VE NEVER SPENT $1
SO, ALAN, YOU'VE SOLD
3,000 UNITS, ONE AT A TIME,
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE?
RIGHT.
I'M ASSUMING
THIS HAS A PATENT ON IT.
I DO HAVE A PATENT.
IT'S BEEN ISSUED A U. S. PATENT.
I HAVE A PATENT PENDING
IN ALL OF EUROPE RIGHT NOW.
MY GOAL IS TO BUILD
AN EXTREME WEATHER GEAR BRAND.
EVERYBODY THAT'S BOUGHT
THIS PRODUCT
CURRENTLY OWNS
A REGULAR UMBRELLA,
BUT THEY CLEARLY RECOGNIZE
THIS PRODUCT
FOR MORE EXTREME WEATHER
CONDITIONS
AND FOR ITS REVOLUTIONARY
HANDS?FREE FEATURE.
I'VE GOT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW
RIDING BIKES WITH THIS
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
THAT'S A HOME RUN.
HOW WOULD YOU RIDE A BIKE
ON IT?
YOU JUST STRAP IT ON,
AND IT WILL NOT MOVE
IN 35?MILE?AN?HOUR WIND.
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S??
IT'S FIRM?
IT WON'T MOVE.
ALAN, WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR,
FOR HOW MUCH?
I'M LOOKING FOR $200,000
FOR A 25% EQUITY.
I'VE ALREADY PUT IN??THERE'S ONE
INVESTOR FOR $400,000,
AND I'VE PUT IN $500,000.
$900,000?
SO YOU'VE GOT $900,000
IN THE GROUND?
$900,000 IN CASH.
ALAN, IF YOU'VE PUT IN
$900,000 ALREADY,
WHY DO YOU NEED
ANOTHER $200,000?
I'M OUT OF MONEY.
THAT'S AN HONEST ANSWER.
RIGHT.
I?I LIKE THAT.
I'VE COME HERE
WITH AN AGGRESSIVE OPTION
FOR YOU GUYS, BECAUSE I'VE SEEN
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING.
SO FAR, I'VE GOT ORDERS
FROM 47 COUNTRIES.
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT GROWS ON YOU.
WHEN YOU FIRST SHOWED IT
TO US,
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
AND WEIRD.
I USE IT IN NEW YORK, OKAY,
AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE
COME UP TO ME AND SAY, "WHERE
DID YOU GET THAT?" YOU KNOW?
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO ANY RETAILERS AT ALL?
I HAVEN'T. I, YOU KNOW, I??
SO YOU HAVE BLOWN OFF
THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION
CHANNEL COMPLETELY.
I GET HUNDREDS OF INQUIRIES,
WHOLESALE,
FROM OUTSIDE OF THE U. S.
WHAT??WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR A LIVING RIGHT NOW?
I'M DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.
SO YOU'RE PROFITABLE, IN REGARDS
TO YOU PAYING YOUR OWN BILLS?
NO. I'VE BEEN GETTING FUNDED,
STILL, INTERNALLY FROM FAMILY
ON THE THING.
OH, THEY MUST LOVE YOU.
THEY DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK TO ME ANYMORE.
(sharks laugh)
(Barbara) ALAN, I'M GONNA, UH,
I'M GONNA??
I LOVE THIS GUY. HE'S HONEST.
(Daymond)
NO, HE'S AN HONEST GUY.
WITH DUE RESPECT, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT SPORTS UMBRELLA.
I THINK IT NEEDS
THAT SPORTS ANGLE.
RIGHT.
BUT IN LIEU
OF THE STANDARD UMBRELLA,
I DON'T THINK
IT'S EVER GONNA BE A GO.
IT'S??IT'S, YOU KNOW,
I NEVER DESIGNED THIS
TO REALLY COMPETE
WITH THE UMBRELLA.
TO ME, IT'S A NEW LINE ITEM.
(Barbara) BUT EITHER WAY,
I'M OUT.
ALAN, UH, I GIVE YOU
ALL THE CREDIT.
YOU CAME OUT HERE, AND YOU TOOK
A VERY ODD?LOOKING THING
THAT MADE ME LAUGH AND CONVINCED
ME YOU'VE GOT A REAL BUSINESS.
BUT AS FAR AS MYSELF, THOUGH,
I'M OUT.
ALAN, I?I?I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I?I ALWAYS LOOK FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S VERY UNIQUE
I'VE MADE ALAN AN OFFER.
I NEVER GOT A YES, A NO,
A MAYBE, A WHATEVER.
THAT'S TRUE.
I MEAN??
UH, WELL... (clears throat)
I GUESS, WITH, YOU KNOW,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I THINK THE EQUITY IS
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH.
SO THAT'S A NO?
YEAH. I THINK
I COULD GO AS HIGH AS 35%.
OUCH.
NO. THAT WOULD NEVER WORK
FOR ME.
MM?HMM.
KEVIN KNOWS HOW TO BRAND YOU
TO THE EVERYDAY CONSUMER,
AND I KNOW HOW TO DO IT
THROUGH RETAIL AS WELL AS GROW
THIS EXTREME WEATHER GEAR
TO A BIGGER PROGRAM.
I DON'T MIND
GETTING IN WITH KEVIN,
BECAUSE I THINK THAT BOTH OF US
ADD CERTAIN AREAS.
YOU CAN GET BOTH OF US
FOR 60% OF THE COMPANY.
W?WE'D PUT THE $200,000 UP.
YOU'D HAVE 2 PARTNERS...
RIGHT.
30% APIECE.
60%??HIS RETAIL POWER,
MY TELEVISION POWER,
TOGETHER,
TO TAKE THIS THING
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
I REALLY WANT YOU GUYS IN.
(laughs)
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH GONNA,
YOU KNOW,
REALLY ADD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
OF VALUE.
UM, I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE RICH.
WOULD YOU ACCEPT 50%
FOR THAT PRICE?
50%?
WE SAID 60%.
ALAN, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A TOUGH DECISION.
IT IS A TOUGH DECISION,
BUT YOU GOTTA MAKE IT.
(Robert) SO, ALAN...
ALL RIGHT, LOOK IT. I'LL LIVE
AND DIE WITH YOU GUYS.
YOU GOT A DEAL.
WE GOT IT. GOOD.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY, GOOD JOB.
THANKS, ALAN.
OKAY.
OKAY.
I LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.
OKAY, BUDDY. GOOD JOB.
(Robert) WOW.
YOU GUYS SLAUGHTERED HIM.
YOU SLAUGHTERED HIM.
WE LEFT HIM AS MUCH MEAT
ON THE BONE THAT HE COULD HAVE.
YOU??HEY.
HE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH,
AND YOU USED IT AGAINST HIM.
I ASHAMED OF YOU.
THE GUY??THE GUY'S A WORKER.
I LIKE HIM.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A?A COMPANY
OUT OF THIS.
I PROBABLY NEVER WOULD HAVE SOLD
51% OF THIS COMPANY
IF IT WASN'T FOR DAYMOND
AND KEVIN.
YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY??
WHAT THEY BRING TO THE PARTY
IS REALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT TO ME
THAN THE MONEY
TO MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN.
