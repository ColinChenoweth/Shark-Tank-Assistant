HI. MY NAME IS MARK BURGINGER.
I'M FROM BEND, OREGON,
AND I'M THE CREATOR OF QUBITS,
THE CONSTRUCTION TOY FOR KIDS.
I WORK AS AN ARCHITECT,
BUT LIKE MANY PEOPLE,
I PLAYED WITH CONSTRUCTION TOYS
WHEN I WAS A KID,
AND I THINK IT INFLUENCED ME
TO BECOME AN ARCHITECT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THIS IS A QUBIT, AND IT'S ABLE
TO BUILD STRUCTURES
BY COMBINING WITH OTHER QUBITS.
CURRENTLY,
WITH THE SLOW ECONOMY,
UH, ARCHITECTURAL JOBS
ARE HARD TO COME BY.
ONCE YOU START
TO ACCUMULATE SOME DEBT,
IT'S A LOAD ON ME,
IT PUTS A LOAD ON MY WIFE,
AND MY KIDS, EVEN,
ARE AFFECTED BY THAT.
SO WHAT COLORS ARE YOU GUYS
WORKING ON NOW?
I'M SEMI?EMPLOYED.
I'VE GOT $60,000 WORTH OF DEBT.
I'VE GOT A GARAGE
FULL OF PRODUCT.
(woman) HERE.
PUT SOME IN HERE.
THIS IS MY LAST HOPE.
IT REALLY IS.
HI. MY NAME IS
MARK BURGINGER.
MY INVENTION IS
A CONSTRUCTION TOY
CALLED QUBITS.
I'M HERE TODAY TO SECURE
A $90,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 51%
CONTROLLING INTEREST
OF OUR FAMILY COMPANY.
SO WHAT'S SO UNIQUE
ABOUT QUBITS?
WELL, QUBITS IS
A SMALL, FLEXIBLE TOY
THAT CAN ALLOW YOU
TO CREATE CURVED SHAPES,
UNLIKE ANY OTHER TOY
IN THE WORLD.
THESE TOYS ARE QUITE EASY
TO PUT TOGETHER,
AS YOU JUST SECURE 'EM
WITH A CONNECTOR.
THEN YOU COULD USE A PANEL
PERHAPS,
AND THERE YOU GO.
YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED BUILDING
SOMETHING. IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
CAN WE SEE THESE?
COULD YOU TOSS SOMETHING TO US
SO WE COULD FEEL IT,
PUT IT IN OUR HAND?
LITTLE TOO FAR AWAY FOR US
TO APPRECIATE IT, I'M SURE.
THERE'S A PART OF ME
THAT'S A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.
YOU SEEM LIKE A CREDIBLE GUY.
IT'S VERY RARE
THAT SOMEBODY COMES OUT HERE
AND VOLUNTARILY SAYS,
"I'LL GIVE UP 51%,
CONTROL OF MY COMPANY."
WHY?
WELL,
THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS.
ONE, I'M SMART.
NUMBER TWO,
I WANT TO PUT TOGETHER
THE BEST BOARD OF DIRECTORS
ANYONE COULD EVER IMAGINE
FOR THIS COMPANY,
AND THIS IS ONE WAY
OF DOING IT.
AND??
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THIS?
YES, I DO.
ARE THERE OTHER TOYS
THAT BEND AND TWIST LIKE THIS?
NO, NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
MARK, I'M SO CURIOUS
HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THIS.
IT WAS A CREATIVE ENDEAVOR
THAT I'VE HAD IN MY MIND
FOR A LONG TIME.
ONCE YOU CREATE A FORM WITH THIS
TYPE OF GEOMETRY, THEY CAN
CREATE NATURAL STRUCTURES
THAT RELATE DIRECTLY TO SCIENCE.
MARK, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
WORKING WITH QUBITS?
HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN
ON THE MARKET?
IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET
SINCE NOVEMBER '07.
OKAY. WHAT ARE THE SALES?
I'VE MANAGED TO SELL ABOUT
$8,000 WORTH OF THE TOY.
SORRY, MARK.
$8,000 OR $80,000?
8??NO, $8,000 WORTH.
BUT LET'S BRING
THE WHITE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM,
THE 9,000?POUND GORILLA.
THE MARKET IS OWNED BY LEGO.
THAT'S THE CONSTRUCTION TOY
OF THE PAST, AND SO FAR,
IT LOOKS LIKE, THE FUTURE,
BECAUSE IT HAS
ALL THE MARKET SHARE.
THE TROUBLE WITH THIS BUSINESS??
AND YES, IT'S A LARGE BUSINESS,
BECAUSE EVERY CHILD LIKES
TO PLAY WITH THESE BLOCKS??
IS GETTING DISTRIBUTION.
TELL ME THAT YOU'VE GONE TO SEE
ONE OF THE LARGE TOY COMPANIES
WITH THIS ALREADY.
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?
NO. I HAVE??
I HAVE NOT APPROACHED
A LARGE TOY COMPANY.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
HAVE YOU PUT INTO THIS?
I HAVE INVESTED $60,000.
OF YOUR OWN MONEY?
QUITE FRANKLY,
I HAD TO BORROW MUCH OF IT.
GIVEN THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE
RIGHT NOW,
THERE'S ONLY ONE STRATEGY.
THIS PRODUCT EITHER HAS
THE MERITS OF SUPPORT BY
A TOY COMPANY OR IT DOESN'T.
THERE ARE FOUR TOY COMPANIES.
SO THAT'S FOUR PHONE CALLS.
YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT.
THEY'LL EITHER LIKE IT
OR THEY WON'T.
TILL YOU DO IT, THERE'S
NO OPPORTUNITY AS AN INVESTMENT.
I'M OUT.
(Robert) MARK,
WHAT MAKES IT HARD IS,
YOU'VE BASICALLY
THROWN AWAY 60 GRAND.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
IT'S A WASTE, MARK.
IT'S NOT A WASTE.
SURE, IT'S A WASTE, MARK.
NOTHING I HAVE DONE HERE
IS A WASTE.
MARK, ONE OF THE GREATEST THING
YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT SALES IS,
YOU GOTTA KNOW
WHERE NOT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.
I'M OUT.
I THINK, RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE COMPETING
IN A HUGE, HUGE INDUSTRY,
UP AGAINST THE BIG BOYS
THAT HAVE SPENT
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN CREATING BRANDS.
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN COMPETE
WITH THEM,
SO I'M OUT, MARK.
AND, MARK, I'M GONNA JOIN THAT
AND SAY I'M OUT AS WELL.
UM...
I DO NOT KNOW THE TOY MARKET
THAT WELL,
BUT...
I LIKE THE FACT
THAT YOU CAME IN HERE
OFFERING 51% FOR $90,000.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE AN EDUCATED MAN,
YOU HAVE DRIVE,
AND I LIKE THE WAY THIS
HAS BRANDING ALL OVER IT.
I'M INTO BRANDS.
SO HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I'LL BE A PARTNER WITH YOU...
51% FOR $90,000,
BUT CONTINGENT
ON US CALLING THE TOP FOUR GUYS
AND WORKING A DEAL WITH THEM.
OKAY? DO YOU ACCEPT?
YES, I DO ACCEPT.
OKAY. WE'RE IN BUSINESS.
FANTASTIC.
OKAY, MAN.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
THANK YOU.
TO GET A DYNAMIC INVESTOR
LIKE DAYMOND JOHN??
HE'LL BE ABLE TO HELP ME
LAND A BIGGER DEAL
THAN I COULD ON MY OWN.
(laughs) THIS IS AWESOME.
MY??MY KIDS, MY FAMILY??
THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE ECSTATIC.
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.
GOT YOU GUYS!
(Harrington laughs)
HE WAS WAITING IN THE WEEDS.
NICELY DONE.
YOU SHREWD LITTLE WEASEL.
IF HE GETS THE DEAL,
HE'S GOT THE DEAL.
IF HE GETS THE DEAL, I GET
THE DEAL. I DON'T, I DON'T.
THE BAD NEWS MAY BE YOU MAKE
THE FOUR CALLS AND THEY ALL SAY,
"WE HAVE NO INTEREST
IN COMPETING IN THIS SPACE."
THEN HE'S GONNA GET THE ANSWER
RIGHT AWAY, AND HE'S NOT
GONNA GET THE RUNAROUND
FROM THESE COMPANIES.
(Harrington) YOU GOT IT.
HE'S GOT A FREE OPTION
IS WHAT HE GOT.
YEAH, THAT WAS A GOOD DEAL.
(O'Leary) YEAH.
I WISH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THAT.
WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS MARKET,
UNDERSTANDS THIS BUSINESS.
DOES IT INCLUDE INVENTORY??
$100,000?
IT DOES INCLUDE
THEIR INITIAL INVENTORY,
THEIR BAGS,
EVERY SINGLE THING.
IN MARKETING
OR ADVERTISING THIS PRODUCT.
WHAT DO THEY SELL FOR
ON THE INTERNET SITE?
$49.
YEAH.
BUT GET THIS??I JUST SOURCED
A NEW MANUFACTURER,
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN BUY
THIS PRODUCT FOR $29.
THAT'S BETTER.
$29?
WHAT'S YOUR COST ON THAT?
MY COST IS $14.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ORDERS
ON THIS?
I HAVE HUNDREDS OF ORDERS RIGHT
NOW THAT I CANNOT FULFILL.
FROM WHAT, CONSUMERS? UH...
ALL FROM THE INTERNET.
AND NOTHING LIKE IT
IN THE MARKETPLACE,
BUT I HAVE A CHALLENGE
WITH THE??THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR??
UH, $200,000 FOR 25%.
THE BEST DEAL I COULD
COME UP WITH WOULD BE 200 GRAND,
UH, FOR 65% OF THE COMPANY.
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY MAKES
ME MAD IS THAT HARRINGTON
HAS HIS OWN DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL
WITH THIS TV STUFF.
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT JUST REALLY PISSES ME OFF...
THANK YOU.
BECAUSE I CAN'T
COMPETE WITH THAT.
(laughs)
LIKE, IT'S A REAL PROBLEM.
I MEAN...
ARE??ARE YOU IN?
NO. I'M OUT.
