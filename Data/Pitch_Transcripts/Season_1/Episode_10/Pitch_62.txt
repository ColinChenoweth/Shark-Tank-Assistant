I'M MICHELE SIPOLT KAPUSTKA.
AND I'M MELISA MOROKO.
YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY.
WE'RE SISTERS, WE'RE NEIGHBORS
AND WE'RE BUSINESS PARTNERS
IN A COMPANY CALLED
SENDaBALL INC.
WE OPERATE SENDaBALL
OUT OF OUR HOMES
IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS...
OUT OF MICHELE'S GARAGE.
THIS IS OUR OPERATION.
(Michele) THIS REALLY IS
A FAMILY AFFAIR.
WE HAVE SEVEN KIDS BETWEEN US,
AND AFTER SCHOOL,
THE BOYS PITCH IN
FOR SOME EXTRA CASH.
EXCELLENT.
IF WE COULD JUST GET A BOOST
FROM THE SHARKS,
WE COULD MASS PRODUCE,
AUTOMATE A LITTLE BIT MORE,
MOVE INTO A REAL FACILITY
AND MAYBE GET THOSE KIDS
OFF THE PAYROLL.
WHO DO YOU WANT
TO SEND THE BALL TO?
WE ARE SLAMMED
WITH ORDERS.
WE NEED THE SHARKS,
AND WE NEED THEM NOW.
HI. MY NAME IS
MICHELE SIPOLT KAPUSTKA.
THIS IS MY SISTER
MELISA MOROKO.
(mouths word)
WE HAVE A COMPANY CALLED
SENDaBALL,
AND WE'RE HERE
ASKING FOR $86,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20%
OF OUR COMPANY.
SENDaBALL IS AN INTERNET?BASED
GREETING COMPANY.
WE SHIP FULLY INFLATED
PLAY BALLS THROUGH THE MAIL??
NO BOX...
(laughs)
NO PACKAGING,
NO BUBBLE WRAP,
DELIVERED BY
YOUR REGULAR MAILMAN.
JUST LIKE AN ENVELOPE,
THE STAMPS AND THE ADDRESS
GO RIGHT ON THE BALL,
AND THE KICKER IS
SO DOES THE GREETING,
LIKE "HAVE A BALL
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY"...
OR...
OR "BOUNCE BACK SOON."
GETTING A BALL IN THE MAIL
IS SO MUCH FUN THAT MOST PEOPLE
WHO GET A BALL IN THE MAIL
ORDER A BALL FOR SOMEONE ELSE
WITHIN 48 HOURS.
AND THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE
TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHIP DOUBLE
THE NUMBER OF BALLS EACH YEAR
SINCE WE STARTED.
BUT THE OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING
FOR THESE BALLS
JUST CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING,
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BRING
THE MANUFACTURING OF THESE BALLS
INTO OUR LITTLE PLACE IN CHICAGO
SO THAT WE CAN FULFILL
THE ORDERS.
WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO FILL
THE ORDERS THAT WE'RE GETTING.
WE NEED THE SPECIALIZED
EQUIPMENT ON?SITE
IN OUR SENDaBALL HEADQUARTERS.
MICHELE, WHY $86,000?
WHY NOT??
LIKE, IT SEEMS LIKE
SUCH AN <i>ODDBALL...</i>
OH!
SUCH AN ODDBALL NUMBER.
WE COME FROM
A PRETTY LEAN GROWING UP,
AND YOU ONLY ASK
FOR WHAT YOU REALLY NEED.
SO...
<i>NO,</i> YOU ASK FOR MORE.
(Robert) DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
SO I?I HAVE, UM, OUTS??
I HAVE DONE SO MUCH RESEARCH
ON THE EQUIPMENT THAT I NEED
THAT I KNOW EXACTLY THE AMOUNT
OF MONEY IT WILL TAKE
TO??TO BUILD THIS MACHINE
THAT WILL MAKE US ABLE
TO PRINT LOGOS ON THE BALL.
HENCE THE $86,000.
RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES?
UM, OUR SALES
HAVE BEEN $100,000 A YEAR.
WALK US THROUGH AN ORDER.
SO I CALL YOU UP...
WELL, YOU WOULD CALL ME UP,
AND YOU WOULD SAY,
"I WANT TO SEND A BALL
TO BARBARA FOR HER BIRTHDAY."
OKAY, COSTS ME HOW MUCH?
COSTS YOU HOW MUCH?
IT COSTS??
WELL, IT COSTS YOU $20.
YEAH.
IT COSTS ME ABOUT $5 TO GET IT
IN THE MAIL TO YOU.
SO YOU MAKE $15.
YES.
MICHELE, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH IT?
I'M STANDING IN LINE
AT THE POST OFFICE,
AND THIS GUY BEHIND ME SAID,
"HEY, WHAT IS THAT?"
AND I SAID, "OH, IT'S A BALL.
I'M MAILING IT
FOR MY GIRLFRIEND,"
AND HE SAID, "COULD YOU MAIL ONE
FOR ME? HERE'S 5 BUCKS."
(laughs)
AND THEN I CALL MY SISTER
WHEN I GET HOME, AND I SAID,
"SOME GUY JUST GAVE ME 5 BUCKS
TO MAIL A BALL FOR HIM."
AND SHE'S LIKE, "HELLO!
WE'RE ON TO SOMETHING."
(laughs)
EUREKA!
THE POSTMAN MUST HATE YOU.
ACTUALLY,
THE POSTMAN LOVES US.
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS
BUSINESS, WE WENT TO THEM
AND SAID, "HEY, DO YOU MIND?"
AND THEY SAID,
"REVENUE IS REVENUE."
REVENUE.
(Daymond) WHERE ARE YOU GUYS
MAKING 'EM NOW?
IT'S ON HER PROPERTY.
(Michele) IN MY GARAGE.
(Daymond) YOUR GARAGE?
(Harrington) IS THAT
WHERE YOU BLOW THE BALLS UP?
(Michele and Melisa) YES.
OKAY.
SHE HAS FOUR BOYS.
LABOR LAWS, PERFECTLY FINE.
(Barbara) SO YOU HAVE YOUR FOUR
BOYS BLOWING THESE BALLS UP
AFTER SCHOOL?
YES. THEY??THEY HAVE TO??
IT'S PART OF THEIR CHORES.
(O'Leary) IT'S SLAVE LABOR.
IT IS NOT!
THEY DON'T BLOW
ALL OF THEM UP.
IF I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
A BIG ORDER, I'LL SAY,
"GET YOUR BODY IN THERE
"AND GIVE ME??FILL THAT BIN,
AND THEN I'LL TAKE YOU
TO SOCCER."
YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR A MOM
TO TELL HER FOUR BOYS THAT,
SHE'S GOT BALLS.
(Michele) I DO HAVE...
I LOVE THE SLAVE LABOR PART.
THAT'S GOOD.
IT'S NOT SLAVE LABOR.
IT'S GREAT. IT'S LOW COST.
YOU CAN BEAT THEM WITH A STICK.
IT'S NOT! LOW COST? YOU KNOW
WHAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT?
(Daymond) YOU DON'T HAVE TO
EMPLOY THEM.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PAY THAT RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S NOT A COST YOU'RE
INCURRING AT THE MOMENT.
NO, THEY DO GET PAID.
THEY DO GET PAID.
HOW MUCH?
THEY GET PAID... (laughs) I AM
GOING TO HELL IN A HANDBASKET.
(laughs) HOW MUCH?
THE LITTLE GUYS GET $6 AN HOUR
AND THE BIG GUYS GET $8 AN HOUR.
(Daymond) OH, THAT'S NOT BAD.
SO, MICHELE, IF YOU MOVED OUT OF
THE HOUSE AND RENTED AN OFFICE
AND YOU GOT EQUIPMENT...
YES.
AND YOU HAD TO PAY YOURSELF
AND MELISA, HOW BIG WOULD??
YEAH.
BUT SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.
YEAH, MELISA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? (laughs)
HOW BIG WOULD
THE BUSINESS HAV??
HOW BIG WOULD THE BUSINESS HAVE
TO BE FOR YOU TO MAKE MONEY?
WELL, WE MAKE MONEY NOW.
YEAH, BUT YOU MAKE MONEY
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
PAYING YOURSELF...
NO, BECAUSE??
YOU'RE NOT PAYING RENT
AND YOU'RE NOT PAYING THE KIDS.
WELL, THE KIDS GET PAID.
THEY REALLY DO,
AND THAT'S REALLY NOT A??
NO, BUT SERIOUSLY,
WOULD THE BUSINESS HAVE TO DO
HALF A MILLION A YEAR
FOR YOU TO MAKE A??
NO, I DON'T THINK SO. RIGHT NOW
WE SHIP 50 TO 75 BALLS A DAY.
IF WE SHIP A HUNDRED OR MORE
BALLS A DAY, IT'S ALL PROFIT.
WELL, LADIES, LOOK, I THINK
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING STORY.
(Robert) ROUGHLY $33,000.
(Michele) THANK YOU.
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE VERY PLEASANT
TO LISTEN TO, THAT'S TRUE.
AND I WOULD NEVER PAY
YOUR SISTER ANY MONEY.
GET HER FOR FREE. BUT, YOU KNOW,
AS AN INVESTMENT,
IT'S, UM, IT'S CHALLENGING.
I ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE BALL BUSINESS.
GOOD LUCK WITH THIS,
BUT I'M OUT.
(Barbara) I'M NOT SURE
YOU EVEN NEED A PARTNER.
YEAH.
HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE BANK
TO TRY TO GET A LOAN?
YEAH, WE HAVE.
(Barbara) AND WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT THE BANK DIDN'T BRING
TO THE PARTY WERE
WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE.
WAS WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE.
REALLY?
SO WHAT EXACTLY WOULD
WE BRING TO THE PARTY
OTHER THAN OUR HARD, COLD CASH?
YOU THINK WE KNOW A LOT
ABOUT BALLS, SHIPPING?
WE THINK YOU KNOW
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
BARBARA, YOU KNOW
ABOUT BALLS.
(laughs) STOP THIS.
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF.
I KNOW.
YOU GUYS,
WHAT AN ENTREPRENEURIAL
STORY. I LOVE IT.
BUT THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THIS, UNFORTUNATELY.
I MEAN, ANYBODY CAN GET A BALL
AND SHIP IT.
SO AS AN INVESTMENT,
I'M GONNA BE OUT.
OKAY.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
YEAH, I FEEL THE SAME.
I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT
FOR WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING.
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ME
AS A PARTNER.
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
ADVANTAGEOUS TO YOU. I'M OUT.
(mouths words)
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT LEFT?
(laughs)
UH, LADIES, I?I, UH,
REALLY ENJOYED IT. UH...
THANK YOU.
UH, VERY, VERY, UH,
INSPIRATIONAL STORY.
MAYBE YOU'LL SEND A BALL
SOMEDAY.
I WILL SEND A BALL.
AND IF YOU CALL ME, I WILL GIVE
YOU THE COUPON CODE. (laughs)
AND I HAD A BALL,
BUT I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
OKAY.
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND
BACK AND FORTH
SINCE YOU STEPPED
ONTO THAT STAGE THERE.
(Michele) OH.
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL.
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I?I'M STILL CHANGING MY MIND.
(laughs)
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M OUT.
AND YOU KNOW WHY I'M OUT?
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU HATING
ME A YEAR FROM NOW AS YOU'RE
PAYING ME OFF, AND THAT'S
EXACTLY WHERE IT WOULD GO.
I HATE YOU NOW.
I MEAN IT.
(Michele)
WE DON'T HATE ANYONE.
YOU DON'T NEED ME.
YOU'RE FINE WITHOUT ME.
LADIES, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
YOUR HONESTY AND YOUR FUN
SHONE BRIGHTLY THROUGH.
OH, COME ON.
THANK YOU.
EVERYONE SHOULD BE THIS WAY.
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE FAMILY.
YEAH,
WE'RE PRACTICALLY RELATED.
WE'RE PRACTICALLY RELATED.
SO YOU COME OVER,
YOU GOT??YOU CAN STAY
IN MY CAMPER.
SLAVIC, SLAVIC. WE ALL SPEAK
THE SAME LANGUAGE.
(sharks laughing)
BUT YOU CAN TELL
WE LIVE AND BREATHE BALLS...
LIVE AND BREATHE BALLS.
24 HOURS A DAY,
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.
STOP IT.
WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
LADIES, YOU BRIGHTEN UP OUR DAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
(Melisa) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT WAS NICE TO MEET 'EM.
YEAH.
WHAT A STORY.
WELL, WE HAD A BALL.
THAT WAS FUN.
YEAH, WE HAD A BALL.
NICE, NICE LADIES.
WE GOT SHOT DOWN
BY THE SHARKS.
BUT THAT'S OKAY, 'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA BOUNCE BACK SOON.
WE HAVE A BALL BUSINESS.
WE'RE NOT SELLING PACEMAKERS.
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.
I'LL MAKE YOU A BETTER OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION
FOR 100% OF THE PATENT.
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO.
THANK YOU.
LIFEBELT, IN SHORT, IS
AN EDUCATIONAL SAFETY DEVICE
THAT PREVENTS PEOPLE
FROM STARTING THEIR CAR...
(beep)
UNTIL THEY'VE BUCKLED
THEIR SEAT BELT.
SINCE I GOT THE OPPORTUNITY
TO PITCH TO THE SHARKS,
I'VE BEEN ON A MISSION
TO GET LIFEBELT IN FRONT
OF AS MANY AUTOMOTIVE RETAILERS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS POSSIBLE.
TODAY WE'RE IN HOUSTON, TEXAS,
MEETING WITH
THE GILLMAN AUTO GROUP,
WHICH IS ONE OF THE OLDEST
AND MOST RESPECTED AUTOMOBILE
GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE
A PRODUCT LIKE THIS
IN OUR DEALERSHIPS.
THE DEAL THAT I'M PUTTING
TOGETHER TODAY
WITH GILLMAN AUTOMOTIVE IS
A MULTIMILLION?DOLLAR DEAL.
APPRECIATE IT AGAIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
ALL RIGHT, OUR PLEASURE.
THE GILLMAN AUTOMOTIVE GROUP IS
GOING TO BE OFFERING LIFEBELT
TO ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS
IN BOTH NEW AND USED CARS
AT ALL OF THEIR DEALERSHIPS.
I BOUGHT THE LIFEBELT
BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT BROOKE ALWAYS WORE
HER SEAT BELT,
AND THIS IS ABOUT THE ONLY WAY
I'D BE SURE OF THAT.
THANK YOU. YOU MIGHT SAVE
MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE ONE DAY.
THESE DEALS
ARE JUST THE BEGINNING.
LIFEBELT WILL HAVE SALES
IN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION
BY MARCH, AND WE'RE
ONLY GOING UP FROM THERE.
