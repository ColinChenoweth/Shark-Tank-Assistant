FOR A VERY LONG TIME??
IN LOVE WITH SHOES.
AND MY BUSINESS IS CALLED

IN THE COMFORT OF HER HOME.
AND I'M NOT JUST ABOUT
BRINGING SHOES TO YOUR HOUSE.
WHEN I COME OVER,
I'M BRINGING A PARTY.

(cork pops)

INTO A SHOE FRENZY.
WELCOME TO

(women cheering)
EVERYONE THAT ATTENDS MY PARTIES
LOVE IT.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I SELL A LOT OF SHOES.
I NEED HELP FROM THE SHARKS
TO BRING MY ONE?WOMAN SHOW
TO WOMEN ALL OVER AMERICA.
MY NAME IS NICOLE JONES,
AND I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT
PILLARS OF SLIPPERS.
I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST
FROM YOU $150,000
IN RETURN OF A 15% EQUITY
IN THIS BUSINESS.
PILLARS OF SLIPPERS IS KINDA
LIKE A TUPPERWARE PARTY,
BUT WE ARE NOT SELLING
CONTAINERS.
WE ARE INSTEAD SELLING
WHAT WOMEN LOVE??SHOES!
I AM THE SHOE PROFESSA!
WE BRING THE SHOE TO YOU??
A HOME?BASED SHOE BUSINESS
WHERE WOMEN HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GET TOGETHER
WITH ALL OF THEIR GIRLFRIENDS??
ROLL OUT THE PINK CARPET,
POP! POP! OPEN THE CHAMPAGNE,
CHOCOLATE, STRAWBERRIES
AND ALL THE FUN THINGS
THAT WOMEN LOVE TO DO!
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
AFFORDABLE,
FANTASTIC,
UNIQUELY DESIGNED SHOES.
AAH!
(laughs)
THERE IS PROJECTED TO BE,
IN THE U. S., 97 MILLION WOMEN
BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 64.
AND GUESS WHAT. THEY ALL HAVE
BUT ONE THING IN COMMON.
THEY HAVE FEET, TYPICALLY,
AND THEY LOVE SHOES!
SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW,
WHICH ONE OF YOU ALL ARE READY
TO GIVE ME THAT CASH?
(Robert) WHOO?HOO!
CONGRATULATIONS.
VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD.
WOW. THAT WAS GREAT.
I LOVE IT.
THANK YOU.
YOU HAVE SOME SALES?
I HAVE SALES
AND I HAVE DISTRIBUTION.
I OWN A RETAIL STORE IN CHICAGO,
AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE
THREE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION.
ONE OF THEM IS MY RETAIL STORE.
THE OTHER ONE
IS OUR SHOE SOIREES
AS WELL AS OUR INTERNET SALES.
RIGHT NOW, IN THIS ECONOMY,
HOLDING ON TO A PIECE
OF REAL ESTATE
IS WHAT IS HURTING
OUR BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.
SO WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IS
BUILD A NEW, SUCCESSFUL MODEL
WHERE WE UTILIZE
THE TWO DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
THAT ARE WORKING SUCCESSFULLY
FOR US.
THAT IS SELLING SHOES
ON THE WEB SITE.
I WOULD LIKE TO BE
A WHOLESELLER, NOT A RETAILER.
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE TELLING US
YOUR SHOE STORE IS
GOING TO ZERO.
IT'S GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
NO, IT'S NOT
GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.
LUCKILY, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO STAY
IN BUSINESS, BUT IT HAS BEEN
A HARD TIME KEEPING UP WITH
ALL THE EXPENSES RELATING TO IT.
WHEN I LOOK BACK
AT ALL OF MY FINANCIALS,
WHERE I MADE
THE MOST OF MY MONEY
WAS IN THE TWO DISTRIBUTION
CHANNELS??
HOME PARTIES
AS WELL AS INTERNET SALES.
SO I WANT TO REDEFINE
MY BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE CRAZY FOR A MINUTE...
UH?HUH.
BUT NOW I'M STARTING
TO HEAR SOMETHING
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.
YOU'RE SAYING BRICK AND MORTAR'S
NOT WORKING FOR YOU ANYMORE.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
YOU WANT TO SELL ONLINE, AND YOU
WANT TO SELL IN A PINK S. U. V.
THAT'S CORRECT.
SO DO YOU HAVE
ONLINE SALES TODAY?
YES, I'M MADE $70,000
IN INTERNET SALES
AND $64,000 IN HOME PARTIES.
(Robert) LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR.
TOGETHER?
50% OF YOUR SALES YOU WANT
TO COME FROM THE INTERNET.
MM?HMM.
YOU DON'T NEED
THE FRANCHISEES FOR THAT.
RIGHT.
THE OTHER 50% IS BARBARA
PAYS YOU A MONTHLY FEE??
SHE'S GONNA PAY AN INITIAL
LICENSING FEE, WHICH??
HOW MUCH IS THAT GONNA BE?
THAT'S GONNA BE $100,000.
WOW.
SO THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE??
SORRY, NICOLE. BARBARA IS GONNA
GIVE YOU $100,000 UP FRONT?
UP FRONT. AND LET ME
TELL YOU WHAT THAT ENTAILS.
WITHOUT SELLING ANY SHOES?
WHOA. WHAT DO THEY GET
FOR $100,000?
THEIR S. U. V., THE WRAPPING
OF IT, THEIR PINK LAPTOP,
ALL OF THEIR MATERIALS THAT
THEY NEED FOR THEIR SHOWS, THE??
N?NICOLE, DO YOU THINK THAT'S
A PROBLEM IN THIS ECONOMY,
THAT WOMEN ARE GONNA HAVE
A CHALLENGE
FINDING $100,000
TO BUY A PINK S. U. V.?
ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS IS GEARED
TOWARDS THE PROFESSIONAL WOMAN
BUT, NICOLE, I CAN'T GET BEYOND
A WOMAN GIVING YOU $100,000
FOR A GAS?GUZZLING S. U. V.
DO??DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD
REFINE THE CONCEPT
AND MAYBE START WITH
A SMALLER CAR OR??OR SOMETHING?
LIKE WHY $100,000?
THAT IS SO MUCH MONEY.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY, ROBERT.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME.
IF I'M GONNA BUILD A COMPANY,
THERE HAS TO BE UNIFORMITY.
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK THE SAME, TALK THE SAME,
BE THE SAME.
NICOLE, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY INTRIGUING,
BECAUSE YOU GET THESE SHAFTS OF
WHITE LIGHT AND PURE THINKING
IN BETWEEN A WAFER
OF NUT BAR FACTOR SIX.
(laughs)
LIKE, YOU KNOW...
THAT IS SO FUNNY.
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU
REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
OR YOU'RE JUST CRAZY.
HOW MANY DOLLARS
OF YOUR OWN CASH
HAVE YOU PUT INTO THIS IDEA?
WELL, IN MY STOREFRONT,
I'VE PUT IN OVER $200,000.
AND INTO
THE PILLARS OF SLIPPERS,
I'VE PUT IN ABOUT $60,000.
(Daymond) TELL ME
ABOUT THE PARTIES.
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE
AMOUNT OF SALES?
IT'S ABOUT $725.
AND TYPICALLY,
THE EXPENSE IS ABOUT $300,
AND I MADE ABOUT $425
OFF OF EACH PARTY.
HEY, NICOLE, I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
TO GO OUT AND MAKE YOURSELF
A LOT OF MONEY SELLING SHOES.
OKAY?
WHERE I HAVE A DISCONNECT IS
YOU TAKING $100,000 FROM PEOPLE
AND SHOWING THEM HOW TO GO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.
THERE'S NO PROOF TO ME
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT. I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I?I?I LOVE YOUR PASSION,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING THERE
FOR ME EITHER.
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY, I'M OUT.
NICOLE,
WOULD YOU SAY YOU ARE
THE ULTIMATE SHOE "DOCTORESS"
PROFESSOR?
I AM THE SHOE <i>PROFESSA,</i>
ROBERT.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
COMPLETELY.
I THINK YOU'VE GONE
TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN,
AND YOU ARE THE BEST.
THANK YOU.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM??THE BEST
SHOE DOCTOR LADY IN THE WORLD
MADE $64,000
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR
WITH THESE PARTIES.
BUT NOW SHE'S GONNA ASK
OTHER WOMEN
TO GIVE HER $100,000.
YOUR CONCEPT IS LUDICROUS,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
UNLESS YOU SELL ONE.
I'M OUT.
(Barbara)
YOU'RE TOO DOGGONE EXHAUSTING.
YOU'RE FEROCIOUS
IN YOUR PASSION.
BUT AS A PARTNER?
I'D BE ON DRUGS.
IT'S WHAT WOMEN LOVE.
THEY LOVE THE ENERGY.
IN YOU.
TRUST ME. I'M TELLING YOU
IT'S WHAT SELLS SHOES.
NO, IT'S A GREAT THING,
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TRANSFER THAT INTO PEOPLE
WHO ARE GONNA PAY $100,000
TO GET A TRUCK AND TAKE
YOUR SHOES AND GO THERE.
IT'S??YOU'RE ASKING TOO MUCH,
SO I'M OUT.
SO AFTER LISTENING
TO YOU NOW FOR A WHILE,
I'M GONNA GRADE YOU
AT 70% ENTREPRENEUR,
30% NUT BAR.
BUT TO BE SUCCESSFUL, YOU NEED
TO BE 100% ENTREPRENEUR
WITH THE ELEMENTS,
THE FLAIR OF NUT BAR??
WISPS OF IT, ESSENCE OF IT.
YOU'RE TOO CRAZY.
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
SO LOOK, NO WAY I'M GIVING YOU
$150,000. I'M OUT.
THANKS.
VERY ENTERTAINING.
(Barbara) THANK YOU.
KEVIN, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
A NUT BAR NUMBER TEN. OKAY?
AND I WILL JUST TELL YOU
THAT YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE,
MISSING OUT ON WORKING
WITH THE SHOE PROFESSA!
