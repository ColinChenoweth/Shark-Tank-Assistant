WE ARE PHILLIP AND AIDA LOUGH,
AND OUR BUSINESS IS LLAMA BREW.
ANIMALS ARE A BIG PART
OF OUR LIFE,
AND WE EARN OUR LIVING
BY PUTTING ON PETTING ZOOS
FOR CHILDREN AND FAIRS
AND OTHER EVENTS.
(quacks)
(bleats)
A FEW YEARS AGO, WE HAD
A MOUNTAIN LION ATTACK
THAT KILLED
SOME OF OUR LIVESTOCK.
SO I DID SOME RESEARCH,
AND I FOUND THAT LLAMAS
WERE A GREAT DETERRENT
TO MOUNTAIN LIONS.
SO I ASKED MY HUSBAND IF WE
COULD BUY SOME, AND WE DID.
WE ENDED UP FALLING IN LOVE
WITH OUR LLAMAS.
THEY'RE WONDERFUL ANIMALS,
AND IT ALSO INSPIRED A GREAT
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.
THIS IS EDEN RIGHT HERE.
EDEN'S WORKING RIGHT NOW,
GIVING US??
GETTING??GETTING READY TO GIVE
US SOME LLAMA BREW, ACTUALLY.
EVENTUALLY IT WILL BE
LLAMA BREW.
WE NEED THE SHARKS
TO INVEST IN LLAMA BREW,
SO WE CAN MAKE A LIVING
THAT EXPLORES OUR INTEREST
IN ANIMALS, THE ENVIRONMENT
AND ALSO ALLOWS US TO SPEND TIME
WITH OUR CHILDREN.
MY NAME IS AIDA CAMWICH?LOUGH,
AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU
MY HUSBAND AND MY BUSINESS
PARTNER, PHILLIP LOUGH.
TODAY WE'RE ASKING
FOR $125,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
OF OUR ECO?FRIENDLY,
GREEN COMPANY,
LLAMA BREW.
LLAMA BREW IS AN AFFORDABLE
LIQUID ORGANIC FERTILIZER
THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING SOLD
FOR HOME GARDENING
AND ALSO
FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.
THIS IS LLAMA BREW
RIGHT HERE.
AND THIS IS ONE OF OUR
EMPLOYEES. HER NAME IS EDEN.
SHE WORKS 24 HOURS A DAY,
7 DAYS A WEEK FOR US.
SO THIS IS LLAMA EXCREMENT,
THIS STUFF?
YES, IT IS.
LLAMA DOO.
LLAMA DOO.
THIS IS A TREE THAT WE BOUGHT,
AND IT DIED
A WEEK AFTER WE BOUGHT IT.
I POURED LLAMA BREW ON IT.
THIS IS THE TREE TODAY.
WHAT MAKES SOMEBODY
GO PICK UP POOP
AND WANT TO MAKE A JUICE
OUT OF IT?
WE OWN LLAMAS. WE KNEW THEY
PRODUCED A FANTASTIC FERTILIZER.
SO IT JUST KIND OF HIT ME??
LET'S LIQUEFY AND PUT IT
IN RECYCLED BOTTLES.
DO YOU DO ALL THE MANUFACTURING
RIGHT THERE AT YOUR??YOUR PLACE?
YES.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE
MANUALLY MANUFACTURING.
YOU SCOOP IT UP?
I SCOOP IT UP FROM??
SCOOP IT UP. SHOVEL IT UP.
WE CALL THIS BUSINESS
GREEN FROM THE GROUND UP,
BECAUSE THE PELLETS
COME OUT GREEN,
AND WE'RE A GREEN COMPANY.
(laughs)
WHAT MAKES THIS BETTER THAN
OTHER FERTILIZERS?
WELL, MOST FERTILIZERS
ARE MAN?MADE CHEMICALS.
OURS IS NOT
MAN?MADE CHEMICALS.
SO THIS IS RIGHT FROM THE BUTT
TO THE PLANT?
YES. YES.
"BUTT TO THE BOTTLE"
SHOULD BE YOUR MOTTO.
(Aida laughs)
OKAY, SO HOW MUCH OF THIS
HAVE YOU SOLD ALREADY?
WE'VE SOLD $4,000 WORTH.
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH $1.25 MILLION,
AND YOU'VE GOT $4,000 IN SALES.
YOU KNOW, I COULD BUY
A LOT OF LLAMAS MYSELF.
I COULD BUILD A LLAMA FARM
WITH THAT MONEY.
I COULD HAVE A MOUNTAIN
OF LLAMA CRAP... FOR LESS.
WE HAVE STREAMLINED
THIS BUSINESS
TO BE THE LOWEST OVERHEAD
POSSIBLE.
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE SHOVELING
FOR FREE.
(Phillip) THAT'S CORRECT.
AND WE ALSO HAVE PEOPLE
THAT ARE SHOVELING FOR US.
THEY'RE DROPPING AT OUR DOOR
'CAUSE THEY NEED
TO GET RID OF IT.
IS THIS A PATENT
OR PROPRIETARY PRODUCT?
CAN YOU PATENT THIS PRODUCT?
YES. WE??WE HAVE, UH, FILED.
WE HAVE A PROVISIONAL PATENT.
ON WHAT?
ON THE PROCESS.
THE PROCESS, NOT THE POOP.
YOU CAN'T PATENT POOP.
(laughs)
(laughs)
SO IS THERE A UNIQUE PROCESS TO
TAKE THE POOP AND LIQUEFY IT?
YES, THERE IS.
NO ONE'S GONNA MIND THE AROMA?
NO.
NO, THERE IS NO AROMA.
(Robert) REALLY?
IT'S ODORLESS?
PEOPLE WALK BY, AND THEY LOOKED
AND THEY SAID,
"IT DOESN'T SMELL."
NOW THE BIG DOLLARS HAVE TO BE
SPENT ON EDUCATING PEOPLE.
LIKE, THE??THE PROCESS
OF TEACHING
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CONSUMER
THAT LIQUEFIED LLAMA POOP
IS GOOD FOR THEIR GARDEN IS
GONNA COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
YOU'D HAVE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
TURD BY TURD.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, I'M INTERESTED
IN HAVING LLAMA MANURE
IN MY PORTFOLIO, BECAUSE I CAN
NOW UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS,
BUT $4,000 IN SALES
IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
OF COURSE.
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT FOR DINNER
AND SPEND MORE.
WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT
YOUR PERCEPTION IS, BECAUSE??
IT'S NOT PERCEPTION.
IT'S REALITY.
NO INVESTOR IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD EVER GIVE YOU $125,000
FOR 10% OF $4,000 IN SALES.
I'M SPEECHLESS. I CAN'T DEAL
WITH YOU GUYS BECAUSE OF THAT.
I THINK YOU MADE
A FATAL MISTAKE.
I'M OUT.
KEVIN HAS VOICED
MY CONCERNS.
IT'S NOT AN INVESTMENT
THAT??THAT I WOULD MAKE,
UH, BASED ON ALL THE NUMBERS
THAT WE'VE HEARD,
SO I'M OUT ALSO.
FOR ME, THE, UH, NUMBERS
JUST DON'T ADD UP,
AS I'M SURE YOU REALIZE BY NOW,
SO I'M DEFINITELY OUT.
(Robert) PHILLIP?
YEAH.
WHAT'S THE COST
OF A SINGLE LLAMA?
THE COST OF A LLAMA?
YEAH.
$500 TO $20,000.
MY KIDS LOVE THEM.
I MAY BUY ONE, BUT I'M NOT
BUYING THIS BUSINESS. I'M OUT.
(Daymond) THANKS, GUYS.
(Phillip and Aida) THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I GOTTA SEE IF IT SMELLS.
DON'T EAT IT, ROBERT.
DON'T OPEN IT. IT SMELLS.
OOH. KEEP IT OVER THAT WAY.
(Barbara) YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO IT?
WHAT ARE YOU COMING
OVER HERE FOR?
COME ON. I'M GOOD.
I'M COOL. I'M COOL.
(O'Leary) ACTUALLY,
IT DOESN'T HAVE A BAD ODOR.
(Robert) IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
HERE. SMELL IT.
(sharks laugh)
IT DOESN'T SMELL THAT BAD.
