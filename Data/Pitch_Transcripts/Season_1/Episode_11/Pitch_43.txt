MY NAME IS DR. FLOYD SESKIN,
AND I THINK
I'VE CREATED SOMETHING
THAT WILL HELP
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
I'VE BEEN A UROLOGIST
AND A SURGEON
FOR ALMOST 18 YEARS,
AND I DEVELOPED MY PRODUCT
BECAUSE OF THE FEEDBACK
I'VE GOTTEN
FROM MY VERY OWN PATIENTS.
HEY. HOW YOU DOING TODAY?
MANY OF MY PATIENTS STRUGGLE
WITH SLEEP
AND WORK AND OUTDOOR
RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES.
AND I WANTED TO DEVELOP
SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE
THESE ACTIVITIES MUCH MORE
ENJOYABLE AND WORRY FREE.
I THINK THERE'S A GREAT NEED
FOR THIS PRODUCT,
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE
TO DO THAT.
I'M A SURGEON.
THAT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING,
AND THAT'S WHAT I DO BEST.
THE SHARKS HAVE THE CONNECTIONS.
THEY HAVE THE DISTRIBUTION
AND THE MANUFACTURING.
AND I'M LOOKING FOR THEM
TO TAKE THIS PROJECT
TO ITS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL.
HELLO. MY NAME IS
DR. FLOYD SESKIN.
AND MY PRODUCT
IS THE UroClub.
I'M SEEKING A MERE $25,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 51%
OF MY COMPANY.
I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED
UROLOGIST,
AND I HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE
IN SOUTH FLORIDA.
MANY OF MY MALE PATIENTS
HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON.
NUMBER ONE...
WELL, THEY URINATE A LOT.
AND NUMBER TWO...
(Barbara and Robert laugh)
THEY LOVE TO PLAY GOLF.
(Robert) OH, NO.
AND IF YOU'VE BEEN
ON A GOLF COURSE,
I WON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE YOU
THAT TREES ARE SPARSE
AND THE BATHROOMS
ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT.
THAT'S WHY MY PATIENTS
ENCOURAGED ME
TO DESIGN AND PRODUCE
THE UroClub.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.
UH?OH. I SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.
THIS IS A TRADEMARKED,
PATENT PENDING PRODUCT
THAT FUNCTIONS
AS A SELF?CONTAINED RECEPTACLE.
(sharks laugh)
IT'S CLEVERLY CAMOUFLAGED
AS A GOLF CLUB.
(O'Leary) OH, YEAH!
(Robert laughs loudly)
IT'S INTENT IS TO ALLEVIATE
THE ANXIETY
AND THE EMBARRASSMENT
THAT MILLIONS OF MEN FEEL
WHEN THEY PLAY A ROUND OF GOLF.
(laughs)
IT LOOKS IDENTICAL
TO A 7?IRON,
EXCEPT FOR THE WIDER GRIP
THAT FUNCTIONS AS THE RESERVOIR.
I DESIGNED THE CAP IN
CONJUNCTION WITH A PIPE FITTER
WHO ASSURED ME
THAT THIS WOULD NEVER LEAK.
IT ALSO COMES WITH A TOWEL
THAT I CALL THE PRIVACY SHIELD.
AND THIS EASILY FASTENS ONTO
THE FRONT OF THE UroClub...
(laughing)
AND CLIPS ON
TO YOUR WAISTBAND.
THIS ALLOWS THE TOWEL
TO DRAPE OVER YOU.
(Daymond) I'M SORRY?
CAN YOU GET STUCK?
WHAT?
NOBODY'S COMPLAINED YET,
BUT IT IS THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL
RIGHT NOW.
HOW IS BARBARA GONNA USE
THIS? SHE LOVES GOLFING.
HOW'S SHE GONNA USE
THIS DEVICE?
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE A?A UroClub
FOR A WOMAN,
I'D HAVE TO MAKE A WHOLE
POP?UP TENT WITH AN ATTENDANT,
I THINK,
TO TAKE YOU TO THE BATHROOM.
(laughs)
(Daymond) AND YOU WOULD NEED
SEVERAL OF 'EM, AND??
THE GUY
TAKES OUT THE CLUB AND??
AND SAYS, "EXCUSE ME,
KEVIN AND DAYMOND AND KEVIN..."
SURE.
"I HAVE TO GO USE MY CLUB"?
LISTEN, YOU'RE 125 YARDS
FROM THE GREEN,
AND YOU HAVE TO URINATE.
YOU TAKE OUT YOUR UroClub.
YOU RELIEVE YOURSELF.
YOU PUT YOUR UroClub AWAY.
RIGHT IN PUBLIC
WITHOUT BEING BEHIND A TREE?
I DON'T USE THE UroClub
TO MAKE THE SHOT.
NO, NO, NO.
IT IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL CLUB.
FLOYD, WELL,
WHEN I WAS ON THE GOLF COURSE,
I?I NOTICED
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE DRINKING
AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT.
SO I THINK THAT THEY WOULD
TOP THAT THING OFF RIGHT AWAY,
AND YOU WOULD NEED
SEVERAL OF 'EM.
LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT THE??
THE CLUB HOLDS ABOUT 18 OUNCES,
WHICH, AS A UROLOGIST,
I CAN TELL YOU
IS MORE THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
URINATES AT A GIVEN TIME.
REALLY?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT JUST SEEMS SO SMALL.
IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION.
UH, IT'S NOT MADE TO, UH,
ELIMINATE BATHROOMS
AND THE NEED TO URINATE.
CAN I SEE IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
FLOYD, WHAT MADE YOU
THINK OF IT?
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A UROLOGIST.
BUT WHAT WAS IN YOUR HEAD
THE DAY YOU SAID...
(snaps fingers)
"HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA"?
THE REAL ANSWER TO THIS,
AND THIS IS THE TRUE STORY,
A PATIENT CAME BACK TO ME
SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER
AN OPERATION, AND HE TOLD ME
BECAUSE OF HIS URINARY
FREQUENCY, HE HAD TO CONSTANTLY
SLICE THE BALL INTO THE WOODS
TO RELIEVE HIMSELF.
AND HE SAID
AFTER THE PROCEDURE,
IT TOOK MORE STROKES OFF
HIS GAME THAN ANY CLUB HE BOUGHT
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.
(Harrington) I'M A GOLFER.
I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS.
THIS IS A GAG GIFT, OKAY.
DON'T YOU SELL 'EM AS GAG GIFTS?
I THINK IT'S GOT
GREAT NOVELTY POTENTIAL.
OH.
I?I?I ALWAYS LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY.
ITS HUMOROUS, IT'S PRACTICAL,
AND IT'S WELL PRICED.
WHAT IS THE PRICE?
WHAT'S THE PRICE?
THE GOING PRICE RIGHT NOW
IS $24.95
PLUS, UH, $9.95
SHIPPING AND HANDLING.
WHAT'S IT COST YOU TO MAKE IT?
IT COST ME $8.43
TO??TO MAKE IT.
(Robert) HOW MANY HAVE??
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD, FLOYD?
ABOUT 3,000.
(Barbara) I'M NOT TOUCHING
THE TOP. YOU CAN TOUCH IT.
WOW.
HANG ON A SEC.
YOU'VE SOLD 3,000?
YEAH.
H?HOW?
WELL, I LIVE IN??IN, UH,
IN SOUTH FLORIDA,
AND I?I MADE
A?AN INFOMERCIAL COMMERCIAL
THAT WAS ON
SOME LOCAL STATIONS.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES?
UH, OVER $70,000...
WOW.
IN GROSS REVENUE.
THAT'S AMAZING.
YOU'RE DOING BUSINESS
ON THE WEB WITH THIS?
YES, I HAVE A WEB SITE,
AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT
OF MY BUSINESS HAS COME FROM,
THROUGH THE WEB.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
IS IN THIS?
UH, A LITTLE OVER $300,000.
WOW!
THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY.
HOW COULD YOU SPEND $300,000
ON A PEE PEE POLE?
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?
WELL, I HAD 15,000
INITIALLY IN STOCK.
THIS IS TRADEMARKED, AND IT'S,
UH, THE PATENT IS PENDING.
AND I THINK YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT??WHAT THAT CAN RUN.
YEAH.
HOW MUCH INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE?
RIGHT NOW I HAVE 12,000 UNITS.
FLOYD, IF YOU STAND
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRWAY...
MM?HMM.
EVEN WITH THE, UH,
GREEN TOWEL,
AND YOU AERATE YOUR PACKAGE...
(laughs)
IS THAT NOT INDECENT EXPOSURE
IN SOME COUNTIES?
I DON'T THINK IT IS.
BUT I THINK THAT
WHEN YOU'RE ON A GOLF COURSE,
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
SO IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
EITHER IN THE WOODS
OR IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCEALED.
FLOYD, UM,
THE HIDDEN THING HERE
IS THAT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
ASKING FOR $25,000 FOR 51%.
YOU'RE A??YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STRATEGIC
RELATIONSHIP OBVIOUSLY.
EXACTLY.
AND, UM, I WOULDN'T KNOW
HOW TO MARKET THAT.
I DO LIKE TO CALL MYSELF
"THE BRAND WHISPERER,"
BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW
HOW TO MARKET THAT.
SO WITH THAT SAID,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
AND IF YOU THINK, UH, HE DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO MARKET IT...
(laughs)
I?I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T RELATE
TO THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT,
SO I'M OUT.
I?I CANNOT SEE ME... (chuckles)
UM, UTILIZING THAT DEVICE
UNDER ANY SITUATION.
I CAN'T INVEST IN SOMETHING
I WOULD NEVER USE. I'M OUT.
IT'S A VERY INTRIGUING
PRODUCT.
AND, UM, YOU KNOW,
BUT AS AN INVESTMENT,
I JUST DON'T SEE IT
FITTING INTO MY PORTFOLIO,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
DO YOU SEE YOUR PORTFOLIO
FITTING <i>INTO</i> THE INVESTMENT?
I THINK MY PORTFOLIO MAY HAVE
A PROBLEM GETTING INSIDE THAT.
(laughs)
ANYWAYS, UH, FLOYD, I'M OUT.
I LOOK AT IT AS A PRODUCT
THAT DOES HAVE SOME POTENTIAL,
AS??AS A NOVELTY,
GAG?TYPE PRODUCT.
AND, UH, THERE'S A LOT
OF GOLF WEB SITES OUT THERE.
THERE'S??AT CHRISTMASTIME,
EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR,
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TO BUY
FOR THAT??THAT SPECIAL GOLFER.
THIS IS THE DEAL
THAT I WOULD MAKE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT A TV COMMERCIAL.
YOU'VE GOT INVENTORY.
I WOULD GIVE YOU THE $25,000
FOR 70% OF THE COMPANY.
YOU'RE GONNA BUY
THE PEE PEE POLE? WOW.
SO IT'S 70%?
FOR $25,000.
I LOVE IT.
OKAY. (claps hands)
SUPER, RIGHT? ALL RIGHTY.
(O'Leary) CONGRATULATIONS.
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS...
(Daymond) CONGRATULATIONS.
DID I THINK THE PEE PEE POLE
WOULD GET A DEAL.
(Barbara laughs)
(O'Leary) OKAY, NOW BOTH OF YOU
WASH YOUR HANDS.
(sharks laugh)
I WAS HAPPY WITH THE DEAL.
I WAS ACTUALLY WILLING TO TAKE
EVEN LESS BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT KEVIN CAN MAKE THIS PRODUCT
A HUGE SUCCESS.
