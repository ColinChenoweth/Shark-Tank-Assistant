HELLO, MY NAME
IS BRIAN DUGGAN.
AND I'M??AND I'M ADAM McCOMBS,
AND WE'RE FROM JumpForward.
WE'RE OFFERING 10%
OF OUR COMPANY
IN EXCHANGE
FOR ONLY $150,000.
DWYANE WADE, THE NBA CHAMPION
OF THE MIAMI HEAT,
JERRY RICE, THE GREATEST
NFL WIDE RECEIVER OF ALL TIMES,
AND NBA STAR BEN WALLACE??
WHAT DO THESE ATHLETES
ALL HAVE IN COMMON?
THEY WERE ALL OVERLOOKED
DURING THE HIGH SCHOOL
ATHLETIC RECRUITING PROCESS.
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES EACH YEAR
WHO NEVER ATTRACT THE ATTENTION
OF COLLEGE COACHES
AND ARE OVERLOOKED.
JumpForward EMPOWERS
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES AND PARENTS
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE ROUT??
THE RECRUITING PROCESS
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
WE DO THIS BY PROVIDING THEM
AN ONLINE PROFILE
THAT ENABLES THEM TO UPLOAD
PICTURES, VIDEOS AND STATISTICS
TO MARKET THEMSELVES
TO COLLEGES.
AT THE SAME TIME,
COLLEGE COACHES CAN NOW SEARCH
THROUGH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ATHLETIC PROFILES
TO FIND THOSE ATHLETES MOST
APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR PROGRAM.
COLLEGE COACHES ARE UNDER STRICT
GUIDELINES FROM THE N. C. A. A.
WITH REGARD TO COMMUNICATION
WITH HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES.
FOR EXAMPLE, COACHES ARE
ONLY ABLE TO MAKE ONE CALL
TO CERTAIN HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT PROSPECT ATHLETES.
HOWEVER, COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS
FOR INFRACTIONS ARE HUGE.
I GET IT.
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?
CURRENTLY, THE COLLEGES PAY
A SUBSCRIPTION FEE.
WE CHARGE BASED ON
THE LEVEL OF SCHOOL.
THAT'S AN ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION,
PLUS WE CHARGE FEES FOR
MAINTENANCE AND, UH, CONSULTING.
HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY MAJOR SCHOOLS?
WE HAVE TO DATE OVER
30 DIFFERENT SCHOOLS SIGNED UP,
300 COLLEGE COACHES
IN THE SYSTEM,
60,000 PROSPECTIVE
STUDENT ATHLETES IN THE SYSTEM.
TO GET DOWN TO MONEY,
IN THREE MONTHS ALONE,
WE'VE GENERATED $150,000
IN CONTRACTS.
I VIEW THIS BUSINESS,
WITH OUR POTENTIAL,
TO MAX OUT AT ABOUT
$15 OR $20 MILLION.
WITH YOUR EXPERTISE,
I BELIEVE WE CAN TAKE THIS
TO A $35?MILLION,
TOP?LINE REVENUE BUSINESS.
WHAT'S THE COMPETITION LIKE
RIGHT NOW?
THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF SMALLER COMPETITORS.
I'LL TELL YOU THIS.
WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US
FROM ALL OF THE COMPETITION
IS THAT WE PROACTIVELY
PREVENT VIOLATIONS.
WE'RE THE ONLY SOLUTION
IN THE MARKET THAT DOES THAT.
COACHES OPERATE
FROM THE MOBILE PHONE.
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
ARE COMPLEX.
AND WITH THE PROLIFERATION
OF COMMUNICATION OPTIONS??
JUST IN
THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE??
COACHES WENT FROM JUST USING
THE PHONE AND SNAIL MAIL
TO TEXT MESSAGING, Facebook
AND TWITTER.
ALL OF THOSE RULES
AND REGULATIONS
ARE ON OUR PROPRIETARY??
AND YOU'RE SAYING
THAT NONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS
CAN INCORPORATE
THAT FUNCTIONALITY?
NOBODY HAS IT TODAY.
WE HAVE A PATENT
ON THE MOBILE APPLICATION.
SO I PUT YOUR CLIENT
ON THE COACH'S BlackBerry.
AND IF HE TEXTS OR E?MAILS
OR CALLS THE SAME GREAT ATHLETE,
AUTOMATICALLY, WHAT, A SCREEN
POPS UP AND SAYS "STOP"?
YEAH. THERE'S CONFIRMATION
SO WE KNOW THAT, UM,
THEY SAW THE MESSAGE.
IF THEY GO AHEAD AND OVERRIDE
IT, THEY'VE SEEN THE MESSAGE
AND THEY'VE MADE THE CONSCIOUS
DECISION TO OVERRIDE IT.
(Barbara) YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
VERY SMART GUYS.
YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS PRESENTATION
THROUGH. HERE'S WHAT I MISTRUST.
I HAVE BUILT
TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES.
THEY'RE ALWAYS
TWICE AND THREE TIMES MORE
THAN YOU EVER ENVISION.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS
NOT SPEND SO MUCH MORE
THAN THEY DICTATED.
SO FOR THAT,
I'M DEFINITELY OUT
'CAUSE I DON'T EVER WANT
TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.
THIS IS HIGH?TECH.
IT'S VERY RISKY.
I'D BE AFRAID IF I PUT $150,000
INTO THIS COMPANY,
THAT COULD BE GONE
IN THREE MONTHS.
SO, UH, I'M OUT.
BRIAN, ADAM,
UM, YOU GUYS ARE WAY TOO SMART
FOR ME.
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED.
I'M OUT.
BRIAN, DO YOU THINK YOUR VALUE
IS IN THE PATENT
OR DO YOU THINK YOUR VALUE
IS GOING OUT TO MARKET
AND GETTING CUSTOMERS?
FIRST, I THINK WE HAVE
A STRONG, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
BY BEING A FIRST MOVER
IN THE SPACE.
TWO, I THINK WE HAVE
A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
IN HAVING A PATENT
ON THE MOBILE APPLICATION.
AND THREE, I THINK WE HAVE
A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
IN THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU,
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH EXPERTS
IN OUR RESPECTIVE FIELDS.
BRIAN, WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
I WAS AT ERNST &amp; YOUNG,
DID ACCOUNTING
AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT FOR THEM.
I THEN WENT ON
TO DO INVESTMENT BANKING, UH,
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS,
CAPITAL MARKETS.
(Robert) WHAT ABOUT ADAM?
I DID ERNST &amp; YOUNG,
INTERNAL AUDITOR.
BUT THEN I SPENT EIGHT YEARS
AT CISCO SYSTEMS.
I HAVE, UH, TWO C. C. I. E. s,
WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY
TWO PhDs IN THE INTERNET.
(O'Leary) WOW. VERY IMPRESSIVE.
(Brian) THANK YOU.
BRIAN, LISTEN. I LIKE THE STORY.
I LIKE YOU GUYS.
I LIKE THIS MARKET.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000 FOR 20%.
WE'LL TAKE
THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION.
$300,000 FOR 35%.
ROBERT...
I THINK YOU NEED??
I THINK YOU NEED MORE CASH.
YOU KNOW, ROBERT,
THERE'S A??
(man speaks indistinctly)
EXCUSE ME, GUYS.
WHY DON'T YOU TURN AROUND
AND JUST EXIT
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES?
I HAVE TO DISCUSS SOMETHING
WITH, UM, WITH ROBERT OVER HERE.
THANK YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING??
WE DON'T WANT TO DO
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO
TO EACH OTHER.
THIS IS GONNA GET
REALLY EXPENSIVE,
SO LET'S STOP RIGHT NOW.
THINK ABOUT IT.
I??
IT'S A BIG MISTAKE
TO (bleep) ME ON THIS ONE.
ARE YOU??
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE GONNA GO UP?
NO, I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S
TWO WAYS THIS COULD GO??
WE CAN STOP RAISING THE PRICE
AND COLLUDE WITH EACH OTHER
TO OUR ADVANTAGE, GIVE THEM
LESS CASH FOR MORE EQUITY??
WHICH IS REALLY WHAT'S ABOUT
TO HAPPEN IF YOU'RE SMART??
OR WE CAN COMPETE.
I THINK THEY'RE GONNA GO
WITH MY $300,000 FOR 35%.
WHY NOT GO $400,000 FOR 50%?
OOH, I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE 50%.
50/50. AND WE??
OH, THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.
THAT'S <i>VERY</i> INTERESTING.
LET'S BRING 'EM BACK. BRIAN?
TWO OF US HAVE BEEN WHERE YOU
GUYS ARE BEFORE,
NOT JUST ONCE, MULTIPLE TIMES.
AND WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO BE
SUCCESSFUL, AND THAT'S MONEY.
WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
NEED, YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE.
THE KEY TODAY IS TO HAVE
A BUFFER OF CASH.
SO THE GOOD NEWS
IS YOU CAME IN
LOOKING FOR $150,000.
WE'RE GONNA OFFER YOU
$400,000.
AND THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS.
IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE 50%.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
BUT WHAT I'LL ASK YOU TO DO
IS BACK OFF THE??THE 50%,
SO THAT WE HAVE MORE ROOM
TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS,
TO ALLOCATE EQUITY
TO NEW AND FUTURE EMPLOYEES
AND GO BACK
TO THE $200,000 OFFER.
WOW. YOU GUYS ARE SAYING NO
TO THE EXTRA CASH?
YES, SIR, WE ARE.
I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE.
BRIAN, ADAM, I'M SPEECHLESS.
I TOLD YOU THEY??THEY WERE
SMARTER THAN ME,
'CAUSE I'D HAVE GRABBED
THAT CASH AND RAN ALREADY.
SO, BRIAN, WE OFFERED YOU
$400,000 FOR 50%,
AND YOU'VE COUNTERED WITH...
I'D LIKE TO GO BACK
TO THE $200,000 THAT YOU
INITIALLY OFFERED, BUT I DIDN'T
STATE AN EQUITY AMOUNT.
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING ME?
$200,000 FOR WHAT PERCENTAGE?
WELL, LET'S PULL OUT
A CALCULATOR AND FIND OUT,
SO THAT WE DON'T...
HE GOT A CALCULATOR.
HE GOT A CALCULATOR ON HIM.
YOU KNOW IT'S NEVER GOOD WHEN
YOU NEED A CALCULATOR, BRIAN.
(Brian) NO, SIR.
16% OF THE BUSINESS.
NO. TOO LOW. IT DOESN'T HAVE
THE GOOD FEELING TO IT.
WHAT IT DOES IS, IT POSITIONS
YOU WITH THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
IN A BUSINESS MODEL
THAT IS PROVEN.
I STILL LIKE
THE $400,000 FOR 50%.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED
MORE CASH.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE
UNABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL
IN 60 OR 90 DAYS.
I BELIEVE THAT
WE HAVE A GOOD STORY, AND IF I??
$500,000 FOR 50%.
AGAIN, I APPRECIATE THE OFFER??
WAIT A SECOND.
BEFORE YOU SAY NO TO THAT, THINK
ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT.
THIS ISN'T "MONOPOLY" MONEY.
YOU REALIZE THAT, BRIAN?
IT'S??IT'S PRETTY HARD
TO GET CASH.
ROBERT, I REAL??
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,
BECAUSE WE HAVE $300,000
OF OUR OWN MONEY IN IT.
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T TAKE
THE DECISION LIGHTLY.
$600,000 FOR 50%.
I...
BRIAN, I'VE BUILT
FOUR COMPANIES FROM ZERO
TO $50?TO?$100 MILLION
IN LESS THAN 5 YEARS.
DONE.
DONE.
OH.
GOOD DEAL, GUYS. I LIKE IT.
I THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME MONEY.
I DO, TOO.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
BRIAN, YOU HAD
A VERY GOOD PRESENTATION.
KEVIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
SEE YOU GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME. APPRECIATE IT.
