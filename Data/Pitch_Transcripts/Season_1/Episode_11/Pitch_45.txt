HI, MY NAME IS JEFF WOLSKY,
AND I'M HERE TO INTRODUCE
THE BOBBLE PLACE
AND ASK FOR $75,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 18% EQUITY
WITHIN MY BUSINESS.
(Robert laughing)
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE MAKE
CUSTOM BOBBLEHEAD DOLLS.
(sharks laugh)
(Barbara) THEY'RE FREAKY. MAN.
HERE YOU GO. ONE FOR YOU.
(Jeff) AND ONE FOR YOU.
(sharks laugh)
(Robert) I LIKE IT.
(Daymond)
I'M DEFINITELY CUTE, BUT...
(O'Leary) THAT IS
A GOOD?LOOKING BOBBLE DOLL.
(Barbara laughs)
LISTEN, JEFF,
SO FAR, GOOD SUCKING UP.
THANK YOU.
CLIENTS CAN PROVIDE
A PHOTOGRAPH TO US.
WE WILL HAND SCULPT THE DOLL
TO RESEMBLE IT.
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS,
THEY CAN ACTUALLY
SEE THE DOLL AS IT'S BEING MADE.
WE'LL PROVIDE PHOTO PROOFS
OF THE SCULPTED HEAD.
THEY GET TO APPROVE IT
OR EVEN MAKE CHANGES IF NEEDED.
IT'S EXCITING
AND IT'S FUN FOR THE CLIENTS.
WHAT I'M LOOKING TO DO
WITH THE??WITH THE MONEY
THAT I'M ASKING FOR
IS TO BRING THESE TO PHYSICAL
LOCATIONS WITHIN SHOPPING MALLS,
AMUSEMENT PARKS,
EVEN NATIONAL CHAIN STORES.
SO YOU WANT A RETAIL LOCATION
THAT SELLS BOBBLEHEAD DOLLS?
IT'S LIKE A KIOSK LOCATION
WHERE THE CLIENT
CAN ACTUALLY WALK IN.
THEY CAN SELECT FROM OVER
100 DIFFERENT BODY STYLES
THAT WE OFFER??
HERE'S JUST A FEW.
THEN THEY CAN SUPPLY
A PHOTOGRAPH TO US
OR WE CAN TAKE THEIR PHOTO.
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN
THAT PROCESS BEINGS.
IS THIS AN EXISTING BUSINESS,
JEFF?
UH, IT IS A COMPANY
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AS WELL,
IT'S A SEPARATE COMPANY. IT'S
AN ONLINE BUSINESS CURRENTLY.
AND IS THAT BUSINESS
GENERATING REVENUE?
YES, IT IS.
HOW MUCH IS THAT?
UH, REVENUES, IN A YEARLY
FASHION, OF SEVEN FIGURES.
BUT WAIT A MINUTE. WHY ARE??WHY
ARE WE NOT INVESTING IN THAT?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET'S??LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS.
HOW LONG HAS THE BUSINESS
BEEN OUT?
FIVE YEARS.
THIS IS GONNA BE ANOTHER
DIVISION OF THAT BUSINESS?
IT'S GONNA BE A SEPARATE
DIVISION OF THAT BUSINESS.
AND YOU WANT US
TO INVEST $75,000
FOR 18% OF THIS NEW BUSINESS?
THAT'S CORRECT.
WHY WOULD I INVEST
IN A BUSINESS OF VAPOR
WHEN I CAN GET A PIECE
OF A <i>REAL</i> COMPANY?
WELL, AT THIS POINT, WE ARE
OFFERING JUST THE BOBBLE PLACE.
IT'S A SEPARATE ENTITY.
YOU MEAN THE VAPOR BUSINESS.
IF YOU HAVE A REAL BUSINESS, WHY
ARE YOU KEEPING THAT FROM US?
OH, IT'S NOT KEEPING.
IT'S A SEPARATE DIVISION.
TELL US THE SALES.
IT??IT'S A 7?DIGIT BUSINESS.
BUT WHAT'S THE NUMBER?
(Barbara) WHAT IS IT?
(Daymond) WHAT SEVEN DIGITS?
WHAT'S THE NUMBER? IS IT
$1 MILLION? IS IT $10 MILLION?
IT'S OVER $1 MILLION A YEAR.
YEAH, BABY!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
ALL RIGHT! THERE WE GO.
(Daymond) AND HOW MUCH OF THAT
ARE WE GETTING?
WELL, AGAIN, I'M OFFERING
A SEPARATE DIVISION WHICH WILL
THEN UTILIZE THE FACTORY
IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY RUN
TO CREATE THESE DOLLS.
SO I GET TO HAVE THE HIGHER?RISK
LOCATION, BRICK?AND?MORTAR IDEA,
AND YOU KEEP THE SUCCULENT,
HIGH?MARGIN ONLINE BUSINESS.
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TALK
ABOUT THE OTHER BUSINESS?
WHAT'S THE KIOSK GONNA COST?
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN YOU MAKE?
WHAT'S THE TRAFFIC ON A KIOSK?
(O'Leary) WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.
DON'T. GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
LET'S HEAR ABOUT
THE OTHER SIDE BEFORE YOU...
I'D LIKE HIM TO START
BY SAYING AND APOLOGIZING
FOR BEING SO GREEDY.
WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY GREEDY.
(O'Leary) YES,
IT'S VERY GREEDY.
IT'S NOT GREEDY
BECAUSE WHAT I'M DOING IS,
I'M GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
YOU TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL MONEY
KNOWING THAT AN ONLINE BUSINESS
IS MAKING SEVEN FIGURES.
THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN PROVEN
IN SEPARATE SALES DIVISIONS.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
ANY OF THE EXISTING PRODUCT.
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO TAKE ALL THE RISK
AND GIVING ME
NONE OF THE BENEFIT.
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?
YOU'RE ON A VERY, VERY SLIPPERY
SLOPE AT THIS MOMENT WITH US.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RETHINK
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA OFFER US
IN THE EXISTING BUSINESS.
BECAUSE WHY HAVE ME
IN A PARTNER??IN SOMETHING I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GONNA WORK?
BUT, DAYMOND,
HE'S NOT OFFERING YOU
ANY OF THE EXISTING BUSINESS.
(Daymond) WELL, I WANT HIM
TO RETHINK THAT.
ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE US
SOME INSURANCE ON OUR MONEY
WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS?
IT WOULD REALLY DEPEND
ON WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE
GIVING A LARGER PERCENTAGE
ON THIS "VAPOR BUSINESS"??
WHICH IS TRULY A BUSINESS??
AND A SMALLER PERCENTAGE
POSSIBLY
ON THE MORE GUARANTEED
BUSINESS.
JEFF, PLEASE,
TELL US ABOUT THE KIOSKS.
GIVE US SOME NUMBERS.
GENERALLY, YOU CAN RENT
A KIOSK FROM A MALL.
(Barbara) MM?HMM.
USUALLY IT'S A $1,500 FEE
PER MONTH.
OR SEASONALLY
IT COULD BE UP TO $3,000.
THAT'S SUBSTANTIAL.
WHAT WOULD AN AVERAGE KIOSK
GENERATE IN SALES
IN A TYPICAL MALL?
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY.
SO IF YOU CAN'T
BREAK OUT THAT DATA,
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY?
WELL, I THINK??I THINK THAT
WE'RE MISSING A BIG AUDIENCE.
MANY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW
THAT A SINGLE DOLL
CAN BE MADE TO LOOK LIKE THEM
FOR LESS THAN $100.
WHAT'S THE PROFIT
IN YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS?
BETWEEN $500,000 AND $600,000
PROFIT PER YEAR.
(Robert) OKAY, SO??
YEAH! WHAT ARE YOU EVEN THINKING
ABOUT GOING INTO A MALL FOR?
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE MISSING??
SEE, WHAT YOU'RE NOT HEARING??
WE'RE MISSING THE PEOPLE
THAT DO NOT KNOW THIS EXISTS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER!
YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS THAT'S
MAKING A PHENOMENAL PROFIT.
I UNDERSTAND, BUT IT NEEDS??
I FORBID YOU TO EVER EVEN THINK
ABOUT GOING INTO A MALL.
BUT LIKE ANY BUSINESS,
YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT NEXT STEP.
YOU NEED TO, LIKE??
I HAVE TO PUT YOUR MONEY
IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY FROM YOU.
I'LL GIVE $75,000 FOR 18%
OF THE EXISTING BUSINESS,
AND YOU ARE GOING TO GROW
THE ONLINE BUSINESS...
HMM.
AND FORGET THIS CRAZY IDEA.
I DON'T NEED $75,000
FOR THE ONLINE BUSINESS.
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU TAKING MY DEAL OR NOT?
I WOULD NOT TAKE THAT DEAL.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED THE MONEY
FOR MY ONLINE BUSINESS.
SO WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?
I'M HERE TO EXPAND AND BRING
THE PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS??
NO, YOU'RE HERE
TO PUT MY MONEY IN HARM'S WAY
WHEN I COULD PUT IT SAFELY
IN YOUR BUSINESS
WITH THE LITTLE HEADS THAT WORK,
NOT THE VAPOR HEADS.
ARE YOU COUNTERING MY OFFER?
I WOULD DECLINE THAT DEAL.
HERE'S WHAT UNCLE KEVIN
BOBBLEHEAD IS SAYING.
UNCLE KEVIN WANTS TO PUT
A SPECIAL BRACELET
ON YOUR ANKLE.
EVERY TIME YOU MENTION "MALL"??
200 VOLTS. WHAMMO.
EVERY TIME YOU MENTION
THE WORD "KIOSK"...
WELL, WAIT, LET ME??
LET ME SPEAK.
YOU GET A SHOCK.
BUT??BUT LET ME??
IT KEEPS GOING UP HIGHER
EVERY TIME YOU MENTION IT.
OKAY, BECAUSE I'M
A WONDERFUL GUY,
I AM WILLING TO DO
75K FOR 15%.
YEAH, SEE, THAT??AGAIN??
AND YOU'RE STILL FORBIDDEN
TO EVER MENTION
THE IDEA OF A MALL.
LET ME THROW THIS AT YOU,
IF I MAY.
WHAT VALUE DO I HAVE TO TAKE
$75,000 ON AN EXISTING BUSINESS
THAT DOESN'T NEED $75,000?
YOU'RE SITTING ON MY CARPET
ASKING FOR MONEY,
AND I'M TELLING YOU
HOW I'D GIVE IT TO YOU.
JEFF, YOU'RE ASKING FOR $75,000
FOR AN UNTESTED BUSINESS.
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER TAKING
THE 18% OF THIS VAPOR COMPANY,
AND THEN IF I GAVE YOU
MAYBE 5%
OF THE EXISTING BUSINESS,
WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT?
(Daymond) NOW, JEFF??
OHH! I WANNA BUY THIS COMPANY
AND WHACK THIS GUY!
JEFF, I JUST WANNA TELL YOU
WHERE I STAND.
I LIKE THE IDEA,
BUT NOT THE KIOSK IDEA.
GREED <i>IS</i> GOOD,
BUT WE NEED
TO BE GREEDY TOGETHER.
AND VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER
WALKED UP TO ME AND TOLD ME
THAT THEY WERE GONNA USE
MY MONEY FOR JUST THEIR BENEFIT
AND NOT <i>OUR</i> BENEFIT.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THE KIOSK IS A SALES ASPECT
FOR YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS.
(Barbara) BUT??
SO WITH THAT...
I AM OUT.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU'RE ASKING FOR TO TEST
SOMETHING IS WAY OVERBOARD.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $75,000.
FOR 10 GRAND,
YOU COULD'VE TESTED IT.
I'M OUT.
JEFF, I CAN'T SHAKE
THE FEELING I GOT
WHEN I FOUND OUT, BY SURPRISE,
"OH, THE OTHER BUSINESS
ISN'T INCLUDED."
I FELT A LITTLE TRICKED.
AND I THINK THAT'S A TERRIBLE
WAY TO START A RELATIONSHIP.
SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE,
I'M OUT.
JEFF, LET ME GO BACK
TO THE ORIGINAL BUSINESS.
WHAT WAS THE PROFIT AGAIN?
OF THE ORIGINAL?
BETWEEN $500,000 AND $600,000.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
AN ACTUAL NUMBER?
WHY IS IT "BETWEEN $500,000
AND $600,000"?
WELL, IT??IT JUST DEPENDS
ON, UM, WHICH YEAR WE WERE IN
WHERE WE WE'RE AT.
WHAT KIND OF AN ACCOUNTANT
DO YOU USE?
'CAUSE MY ACCOUNTANT USUALLY
GIVES ME PRETTY HARD NUMBERS,
DOESN'T GO IN BETWEEN.
UH, AGAIN, I CAME HERE
WITHOUT THE CONCEPT
OF BRINGING THAT IN,
SO I??
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR OWN BUSINESS MAKES PER YEAR
WHEN YOU DO YOUR TAXES?
WELL, OF COURSE I DO.
OKAY, SO WHAT'S THAT NUMBER?
BETWEEN
$500,000 AND $600,000.
(sharks laugh)
OKAY.
ARE YOU IN OR OUT?
WELL, I'M??I'M SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
"I'M OUT" AND "I'M IN." (laughs)
LISTEN, FORGET THIS NOISE.
HOW ABOUT THIS?
I'LL GIVE 100 GRAND
FOR 20% OF YOUR COMPANY.
BUT YOU NEED SOME COACHING
REGARDING MALLS.
YOU GOT A MALL ADDICTION.
YOU GOTTA GET RID OF THAT.
(laughter)
YOU GET A $100,000 CHECK
FROM ME.
I SEND YOU OFF TO BETTY FORD??
THE SPECIAL MALL DIVISION.
YOU GET OVER THAT WHOLE IDEA.
BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS??
WHAT ELSE DO YOU OFFER, THEN,
BESIDES JUST GIVING ME A CHECK?
JEFF, HE OFFERS YOU BAD JOKES.
NO, NO, YOU GET <i>ME.</i>
YOU GET ME.
(chuckles)
ALL RIGHT, JEFF,
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000
FOR 20%.
WELL, POSSIBLY??
POSSIBLY TOGETHER,
WITH MULTIPLE REALMS
OF EXPERTISE,
WE CAN EVEN MAKE THIS
EVEN SWEETER.
SUCH AS?
WE CAN ACCEPT THE $125,000.
WE CAN ACCEPT THE $100,000.
WE CAN GO TO 10% PER PERSON,
MAKING IT 20%.
STILL A GREAT RETURN
ON YOUR MONEY.
YOU'RE SAYING 20%
FOR $200,000?
UH, IT'D BE $225,000.
WAIT A SECOND.
I OFFERED $100,000
FOR 20% OF THE BUSINESS.
I OFFERED $125,000 FOR 20%.
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO, GO BACK
INTO THE DARK FOR A MINUTE
'CAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF.
LOOK, THIS IS NUTS.
WE'RE NEGOTIATING THE PRICE
UP AGAINST EACH OTHER.
SO HERE'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO.
LET'S GO BACK TO MY ORIGINAL
DEAL??$100,000 FOR 20%.
HE DOUBLED THE PRICE
WHEN YOU GOT INVOLVED.
YOU GOTTA CUT HIM BACK.
THAT'S THE DEAL.
BRING HIM BACK.
ALL RIGHT. JEFF.
BRING HIM BACK.
ALL RIGHT. JEFF.
JEFF, HELL IS FREEZING OVER,
AND, UH, KEVIN AND I CAME TO
A MEETING OF THE MINDS.
SO LET'S BE CLEAR
ON WHAT THE OFFER IS.
$100,000...
FOR 20% OF THE BUSINESS.
ROBERT AND I ARE GONNA GO
50/50 ON THAT.
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING.
YOU TRIED TO MOVE US UP,
BUT NO, NO, NO, NO, NANETTE.
STAYING AT $100,000,
20% OF THE BUSINESS.
THAT'S THE OFFER. YES OR NO?
UNFORTUNATELY,
I WOULD HAVE TO DECLINE.
BUT, JEFF, I'LL GO BACK
TO MY OTHER OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $125,000
FOR 20%.
(groans)
BUT LET ME ADR??ARE YOU NOW
OFFICIALLY OUT OF THIS OFFER?
I'M OUT.
UM, I WOULD CONSIDER
THE??THE...
I WOULD CONSIDER $100,000
FOR 7%.
JEFF, I'VE LEARNED,
IN BUSINESS, WHEN SOMETHING
IS THIS COMPLICATED
THE DAY WE GET TOGETHER...
MM?HMM.
UM, THERE'S AN OLD
YIDDISH SAYING THAT SAYS,
"THE WAY IT BEGINS IS
THE WAY IT ENDS." SO I'M OUT.
JEFF, WE'RE DONE.
