I'M SANDY HYUN.
AND I'M ROMAN PIETRS.
WE LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY.
AND THE NAME OF OUR COMPANY
IS MR. PONCHO.
MR. PONCHO.
I'VE BEEN DESIGNING JEWELRY
FOR FIVE YEARS,
AND I CREATED MR. PONCHO
BECAUSE I NEEDED A SOLUTION
FOR AN EVERYDAY PROBLEM.
AND WHEN SANDY HAD THIS IDEA,
I FLIPPED OUT.
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
THIS IS PROBABLY HER
SECOND BEST IDEA SHE'S EVER HAD.
THE FIRST BEST, UH,
WAS HER DECISION TO DATE ME.
(laughs)
? WHAT YOU GONNA DO ?
? WHEN YOUR CORDS
ARE ALL TANGLED UP?
? MR. PONCHO ?
IT'S BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE
WORKING ON MR. PONCHO
WITH SANDY
IN OUR APARTMENT,
JUST THE TWO OF US.
(falsetto) ? MR. PONCHO... ?
BUT WE JUST WANNA LIVE HERE.
WE DON'T WANNA WORK HERE.
(laughs) WHAT DO YOU THINK?
(grunts)
(laughs)
(Sandy) RIGHT NOW WE'RE MAKING
MONEY WITH MR. PONCHO.
AND HOPEFULLY THE SHARKS
WILL SEE THE POTENTIAL
THAT MR. PONCHO HAS
BECAUSE OF THAT.
(clicks tongue)
HI, I'M SANDY HYUN.
AND MY NAME IS ROMAN PIETRS,
AND WE'RE HERE
FROM NEW YORK CITY.
AND THE NAME
OF OUR BUSINESS IS...
(both) ? MR. PONCHO ?
? OH ?
(sharks laugh)
UH, ROMAN, YOU CAN SING.
(Harrington) THAT'S FUNNY.
(Barbara) WOW.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE SEEKING
A $50,000 INVESTMENT,
AND WE'RE WILLING TO
PART WITH 25% EQUITY.
TO DATE, OVER 300 MILLION PEOPLE
HAVE PURCHASED MP3 PLAYERS
AND 200 MILLION SMARTPHONES.
THAT'S OVER 500 MILLION PAIRS
OF HEADPHONES
THAT ARE PROBABLY
GONNA END UP
LOOKING LIKE THIS TANGLED,
BROKEN MESS.
TANGLED HEADPHONES
ARE SO FRUSTRATING
FOR ANYBODY WHO USES
THESE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING US.
SO WHAT STARTED OUT
AS A SIMPLE SOLUTION
TO A VERY COMMON PROBLEM
LED TO OUR PRODUCT MR. PONCHO.
SO WITH MY JEWELRY DESIGN
BACKGROUND...
AND MY GRAPHIC DESIGN
BACKGROUND,
WE CREATED A PRODUCT WHICH
NOT ONLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM
OF TANGLED HEADPHONE CORDS,
BUT PROVIDES THE USER
WITH A FUN, FUNCTIONAL WAY
OF KEEPING THEIR MP3 PLAYER
OR SMARTPHONE SAFE.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU PUT YOUR MP3 PLAYER
IN THIS PROTECTIVE SLEEVE.
YOU POP THIS RUBBER PART OUT.
AND YOU SIMPLY WRAP AND UNWRAP
YOUR HEADPHONES JUST LIKE THAT.
IT'S SO EASY.
IT'S SO EASY AND SO FUN.
(chuckles)
SANDY, CAN I SEE ONE?
OH, SURE.
CAN WE ALL SEE ONE?
SO TELL ME ABOUT
THE SALES HISTORY.
(Roman) WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR TWO YEARS NOW.
OUR FIRST YEAR...
THANK YOU.
WE GROSSED, UH, $11,000.
AND OUR SECOND YEAR,
$35,000 IN GROSS PROFITS.
ROMAN, IT??IT??JUST SO I'M CLEAR
HOW IT WORKS, IT??
DO YOU WANT ME TO??
(Robert) THE CASE
IS ALL PART OF IT?
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO??RIGHT,
AND YOU POP THIS RUBBER PART
OUT. YOU ACTUALLY FLIP IT OUT.
OH, I SEE. OKAY. OKAY.
IT'S REALLY DURABLE,
SO YOU COULD BE ROUGH WITH IT.
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THIS?
THIS??WE'VE GOT A PATENT PENDING
ON THE ENTIRE UNIT.
WE'VE??WE'VE REPURPOSED THIS
LITTLE??THIS LITTLE DEVICE.
RIGHT.
UH, WHICH??WHICH HAS
ITS OWN PATENT. SO...
SO WHAT??
A PATENT YOU HAVE?
ITS OWN PATENT?
NO, NO, NO. WE DON'T HAVE
A PATENT ON THIS...
(Barbara) THE CUP
THAT HOLDS THE WIRE.
THIS LITTLE??
THIS LITTLE PIECE.
SO, ROMAN,
ONCE I POP IT OUT...
(Sandy) MM?HMM.
I UNDO THIS.
YEP.
AND THEN
I LISTEN TO IT.
SURE.
GROOVE ALONG, AND THEN...
WHEN YOU'RE??WHEN YOU WANT??
DO I JUST FOLD IT BACK?
(Sandy) MM?HMM.
YEAH, WHEN YOU WANNA??
YOU MEAN THERE'S NO MECHANISM
WHERE IT AUTOMATICALLY REELS IN?
NO.
NO. I MEAN, THAT'S??IT??
IT'S??
IT'S A REALLY, REALLY SIMPLE
LITTLE??LITTLE DEVICE.
SO IT'S JUST A LITTLE??HOW IS
THIS REALLY THAT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN??THAN ME TAKING
THE EARPHONES
AND WRAPPING THEM AROUND
MY iPhone?
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND
THAT IF YOU DO THAT
AND YOU PUT THAT IN YOUR BAG,
SOMEHOW THOSE HEADPHONES
ARE GONNA MANAGE TO??
I'D BUY THE PROTECTOR,
BUT YOU SAID
THAT THERE WAS A PATENT??
BUT IT WASN'T YOURS??
ON THIS PIECE.
SO THIS PIECE ACTUALLY HAS
A DIFFERENT PURPOSE.
SO WE REPURPOSED IT, ATTACHED IT
TO THEM UH, THE MP3 CASE.
(O'Leary) YEAH.
AND, UM, SO NOW IT'S A DIFFERENT
PRODUCT ALL TOGETHER.
WHAT'S IT SELL FOR?
IT SELLS FOR $18.
AND WE'VE SOLD OVER 5,000
OF THESE,
AND WE'VE MADE EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THEM OURSELVES
IN OUR APARTMENT.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT?
IT COSTS $3
FOR US TO MAKE IT.
OKAY.
THAT DOESN'T PAY FOR YOUR OWN
LABOR. THAT'S FOR FREE, RIGHT?
THAT'S JUST MATERIALS?
YES. YES.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
AT THIS POINT IT'S FREE.
YEAH.
YOU GUYS ARE
MAKING THESE THINGS AT HOME.
YOU'RE SELLING THEM
FOR ABOUT $18.
HOW MUCH INFORMATION
DO YOU HAVE
ON WHAT IT WOULD COST
TO MANUFACTURE THIS PRODUCT?
BECAUSE IF YOU DO GET INTO
ONE OF THESE OUTLETS,
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE THOUSANDS
OR MILLIONS OF THESE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION
ON WHAT IT WOULD COST?
PROBABLY UNDER A DOLLAR.
BUT DO YOU KNOW THIS
FOR A FACT?
UH, JUST BUY THE COST
OF THE MATERIALS ALONE.
YOU, UH, YOU'VE PRICED THESE...
(Sandy) MM?HMM.
WITH MANUFACTURERS?
OH, NO.
NOT WITH MANUFACTURERS.
ROMAN, MY KIDS
WOULDN'T BUY THIS.
AND THE REASON
THEY WOULDN'T BUY IT IS,
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO THEM IS THE SKIN
THAT THEY PUT ON THEIR iPhone
OR ON THEIR BlackBerry.
I MEAN, KIDS LOVE THAT. THEY BUY
ONE TODAY BECAUSE GREEN IS COOL.
THEN THEY BUY PINK. AND THEY'RE
CHANGING THE COVER ALL THE TIME.
WHY COULDN'T YOU MAKE
THIS COMPONENT
THAT YOU COULD STICK ON
TO ANY SKIN?
SOMEONE ELSE HAS THE PATENT
ON WHAT THE CENTRAL DEVICE IS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S A SMALL BUSINESS.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY HAVING
SOME LEVEL OF SUCCESS.
IT'S INTERESTING. IT'S COOL.
AS AN INVESTOR, I'M OUT.
I LOVE THAT MIDDLE DEVICE??
EXACTLY AS ROBERT WAS SAYING??
WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA
<i>IF</i> YOU HAD THE PATENT.
I FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE
THE PATENT
ON THE REAL DEAL HERE,
SO I'M OUT.
SANDY, ROMAN, UH,
LIKE YOU GUYS.
THE BUSINESS, I THINK,
IS TOO PREMATURE.
YOU DON'T KNOW THE MANUFACTURING
ASPECT OF THIS,
SO I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS.
YOU DO NOT HAVE A PATENT
ON THIS PRODUCT.
THERE'S NO WINDOWS IN THERE TO
SEE WHAT MUSIC YOU'RE PLAYING.
I CAN'T SEE MYSELF ATTACHING IT
TO MY ARM OR MY BELT.
OH, NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.
I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO EARLY FOR ME TO GRASP IT.
I'M OUT.
(Harrington) I THINK YOU GOT
A GREAT HOME BUSINESS.
I THINK IT'S REALLY A, UH,
TO CONTINUE TO YOUR BUSINESS
AS YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS,
BUT AS AN INVESTOR, IT'S A TOUGH
THING FOR ME TO, UH, INVEST IN.
SO I'M OUT. THANK YOU
FOR BEING HERE, THOUGH.
(both) THANK YOU.
