HI. I'M MARIX STONE,
AND I'M THE CREATOR AND DESIGNER
OF HELLS BELLS HELMETS.
I'M DR. NANCY TANCHEL.
I'M THE C. E. O. OF THE COMPANY.
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU
FOR AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000
FOR 20% OF OUR COMPANY.
WHEW!
FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS,
I'VE BEEN DESIGNING PRODUCTS
FOR THE CUSTOM MOTORCYCLE
INDUSTRY.
I DEVELOPED THE ENTIRE
THREE?DIMENSIONAL PROCESS
THAT IS INCLUDED
AND ALL THE ARTISTRY
THAT MAKES THE HELLS BELLS
A SUCCESS.
ESSENTIALLY,
WHAT I REALLY DID, THOUGH,
WAS I TOOK A LEGALLY MANDATED
SAFETY HELMET.
I MADE IT STRONGER,
I MADE IT SAFER
AND I MADE IT 10,000 TIMES
MORE APPEALING,
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE THREE?DIMENSIONAL GRAPHICS
THAT ACTUALLY EVOLVED
FROM THE SHELL. OKAY?
SO...
THE, UM...
WE, UH...
ONLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WATCHING. TAKE YOUR TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
(chuckles) AND BASICALLY
WHAT HAPPENED IS,
UH, WE... I'M SO SORRY.
A NERVOUS BIKER.
I AM REALLY NERVOUS.
WELL, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT??
WE OWN A UTILITY PATENT
TO PLACE
THREE?DIMENSIONAL DESIGNS
ON NOT ONLY MOTORCYCLE HELMETS,
BUT ANY KIND OF SPORTING HELMET.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY SALES RIGHT NOW?
YES, WE DO. WE ACTUALLY ARE
ON TRACK THIS YEAR TO BRING IN
$300,000 OF SALES
JUST FOR THE MOTORCYCLE HELMETS.
LET ME SEE THE ONE WITH THE FACE
ON IT, THAT ONE THAT HE'S...
IT'S THE ONLY HELMET OF ITS KIND
IN THE WORLD.
BRING ANOTHER ONE UP.
WELL,
THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE
AND THE REASON WE'RE SEEKING
AN INVESTMENT FROM Y'ALL
IS SO THAT WE CAN GET INTO
THE MASS PRODUCTION
OF THESE HELMETS.
THAT TAKES A BIG INVESTMENT.
DOCTOR,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING...
(Nancy) YES, SIR.
ABOUT THE DESIGN
OF THESE THINGS.
TAKE ROBERT, FOR EXAMPLE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE DESIGNS
CAN BE WHATEVER PEOPLE WANT.
NANCY, LET'S GO??CAN I GO
BACK TO ONE THING...
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT YOU SAID AND WE KIND OF
COMPLETELY MISSED OVER?
YOU OWN A PATENT.
A UTILITY PATENT.
YOU'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE
THAT CAN PUT A 3?D DESIGN
SPORTING HELMET?
(Nancy) ANY SPORTS HELMETS.
SO, MARIX, IF THAT'S TRUE??
AND I GUESS I HAVE TO GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT??
I JUST THINK THAT
THAT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE ASSET.
WE'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO CHECK IT OUT.
(laughs)
WHAT DOES A REGULAR HELMET
SELL FOR?
$175.
THIS ONE?
WELL, HOW ABOUT??
WHAT'S THE PROFIT?
THE PROFIT MARGIN IS OVER 50%,
WELL OVER 50%.
AND IF WE WERE TO MASS PRODUCE,
BRING OUR COST DOWN
EVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE,
IT WOULD EVEN BE MORE FAVORABLE.
LET'S GET DOWN TO
THE NUMBERS FOR A SECOND.
2009 SALES??END OF THIS YEAR,
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL MAKE
IN REVENUE OFF THESE HELMETS
THIS YEAR?
UM... (makes whooshing noises)
IT'LL BE AROUND $175,000
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.
GUYS, I THINK THE POTENTIAL
HERE IS TREMENDOUS,
BUT IT'S TOUGH FOR ME
TO WRITE A CHECK
FOR HALF A MILLION
ON THE POTENTIAL.
SO I'M GONNA BOW OUT NOW.
THANK YOU.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT.
IT'S TOO LARGE A STRETCH??
THE OPTIMISM, THE EXCITEMENT,
I LIKE THE HELMET, I PUT IT ON??
I WAKE UP TOMORROW MORNING
AND I SAY TO MYSELF,
"WHY DID I GIVE
THOSE GUYS $500,000
JUST BECAUSE
THEY WERE SMILING AT ME?"
I NEED A LOT MORE EVIDENCE
THAT THIS TRAJECTORY IS VALID,
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THIS ISN'T MY CUP OF TEA,
SO I JUST WANNA... I'M OUT.
THERE'S REALLY NO QUESTION.
THIS IS GONNA BE A HUGE PRODUCT,
WHETHER WE LICENSE IT OUT OR...
THE ONLY QUESTION IS...
YES?
THE NUMBER YOU PUT ON IT,
DOCTOR.
I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND.
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, AGAIN,
AS YOU GUYS
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED,
THERE IS THIS PATENT INVOLVED,
AND THIS PATENT
IS EXCEPTIONALLY BROAD.
THERE'S A HUGE VALUE
TO THIS PATENT.
YOU'RE VALUATING THE COMPANY
AT $2.5 MILLION,
AND YOU ONLY HAVE $300,000
IN SALES.
TO GIVE YOU $500,000 IN CASH,
I WOULD BE CRAZY RIGHT NOW.
NANCY, DO YOU WANT
TO SELL A LOT OF HELMETS
OR DO YOU WANT
TO MANUFACTURE THEM?
WELL, WE WANT TO DOMINATE
THAT INDUSTRY.
BUT IF WE COULD STRUCTURE
A DEAL...
MM?HMM.
WHERE WE LICENSE IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE,
WE NEVER HAVE
TO MAKE A SINGLE ONE...
RIGHT.
AND YOU COLLECT
A PERCENTAGE OF A ROYALTY
OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS...
SURE.
ARE YOU MORE INTERESTED
IN DOING THAT
OR ARE YOU MORE INTERESTED...
WELL, WE WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.
WE WANT YOUR EXPERTISE.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I??
I'LL DO??I'LL DO FOR YOU.
YES?
NORMALLY I WOULD ASK
FOR 51% OR 70%
TO TAKE ON ALL THIS,
BUT WHAT I'LL DO FOR YOU IS,
I'LL GO 50/50 WITH YOU.
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY,
I WILL GIVE YOU THE $500,000,
AND MY OBJECTIVE
AT THE END OF THE DAY
IS TO LICENSE THIS
TO A BUNCH OF COMPANIES.
CAN I ASK THIS??
WILL IT??WILL IT HAVE
THE SAME DETAIL
AND THE??THE ARTISTIC
PROPERTIES?
WE WILL BE PARTNERS, AND WE WILL
MAKE THIS DECISION TOGETHER.
AND ALL THE ASPECTS THAT MAKE
THIS GREAT WILL NEED TO BE THERE
OR IT'S NOT WORTH IT FOR ME.
MARIX, JUST SO YOU KNOW
WHERE I STAND...
I'M GONNA BE OUT. HIS
OFFER IS BETTER THAN MINE.
I WAS GONNA OFFER YOU
$500,000 FOR 75%,
BUT HIS OFFER IS BETTER
AS A STARTING POINT.
THANK YOU.
SO, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WE'RE EXCITED TO GET
INTO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
WE THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER
AND BUILD
A BILLION?DOLLAR BRAND.
WELL, IS THAT A YES?
YES.
YOU BETCHA.
IT'S A YES ON MY SIDE.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE EXCITED. BYE.
(Marix) THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BYE.
WE'VE MADE A GOOD DEAL. I THINK
DAYMOND IS THE RIGHT PERSON.
HE'S INVOLVED WITH
A GOOD HISTORY OF BRANDING
AND??AND SALES, SO I THINK
HE'S GONNA WORK WITH US,
AND WE WILL??WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A BILLION?DOLLAR BRAND TOGETHER.
I MAY REGRET THAT ONE.
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL, DAYMOND.
I GOTTA ADMIT.
IT WAS SUCH A BIG ASK
WITH SO LITTLE REVENUE.
I'M SO MAD AT YOU,
I'M GONNA RIDE AWAY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BARBARA?
YOU LOOK ADORABLE,
BUT HE LOOKS RIDICULOUS.
