MY NAME IS DORENE HUMASON.
I LIVE IN FOLSOM, CALIFORNIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS
THE CHEF IN BLACK.
FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS, I HAVE
WORKED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY
AS A BUYER AND A FOOD SALES
REPRESENTATIVE.
OH, LOOK AT THESE.
THERE WAS ONE TIME
I WAS GOING TO PREPARE
ONE OF MY KIDS' FAVORITE DISHES,
AND COULD NOT FIND
THE INGREDIENTS AT THE STORE.
SO THAT GAVE ME THE INSIGHT
THAT THERE WAS A VOID,
AND THAT'S HOW MY PRODUCT
WAS CREATED.
BON APPÈTIT!
I HAVE CREATED
WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE A HIT
TO CONSUMERS AROUND THE WORLD.
I REALLY NEED THE SHARKS
TO INVEST IN MY COMPANY
SO I CAN BRING IT
TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
AND CONTINUE TO SHARE
THIS DELICIOUS PRODUCT.
THANKS, MOM.
HI. I'M DORENE HUMASON,
PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF
THE CHEF IN BLACK INCORPORATED.
I'M REQUESTING
A $50,000 INVESTMENT
AND IN RETURN, I'M OFFERING
A 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
MY PRODUCT IS
JADEN CHINESE SALAD DRESSING
AND SEASONING MIX,
WHICH IS A PERFECT BLEND
OF ALL?NATURAL SPICES
AND SEASONINGS
THAT ALLOWS THE HOME COOK
TO MAKE FRESH
CHINESE SALAD DRESSING AND DIPS.
BROOKE WILL NOW PASS OUT
SAMPLES TO EACH OF YOU
OF THE JADEN
CHINESE SALAD DRESSING.
I WAS ON A SEARCH
FOR THE PERFECT CHINESE SALAD
DRESSING AND HAD NO SUCCESS.
SO I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DEVELOP A PRODUCT
THAT ADDRESSES IT.
MMM.
THIS IS A SINGLE PRODUCT?
JUST THAT ONE?
RIGHT NOW. I CURRENTLY HAVE
1,300 GROCERY STORES.
SO IT IS ON THE SHELF NEXT TO
THE DRY SALAD DRESSING PACKETS.
SO, DORENE, IS BROOKE
YOUR DAUGHTER, BY THE WAY?
YES, SHE IS.
YEAH.
SHE'S MY BABY.
YOU LOOK LIKE SISTERS.
OH, I LOVE YOU.
UM, H?HERE'S MY CHALLENGE
WITH FOOD??
I USED TO KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THE FOOD BUSINESS,
AND THEN I MADE AN INVESTMENT
IN IT.
OF SALAD DRESSINGS,
BARBECUE SAUCES...
AND ALL KINDS
OF OTHER FOOD STUFF.
AND INEVITABLY,
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO MARKET SHARE
ON A SHELF IN A STORE.
TELL ME YOUR PLAN??HOW YOU'RE
GONNA GET THIS NATIONALLY
AND WE'RE GONNA SELL
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
THAT IS EXACTLY, UM,
A VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERN,
AND BEING IN THE BUSINESS
FOR 27 YEARS, I KNOW THAT.
AND FOR ME TO QUIT MY JOB
AND TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AT THIS STAGE IN MY LIFE,
I NEEDED TO BE SURE
MY RISKS WERE LIMITED.
BUT I HAVE A PRODUCT
THAT IS VERY POPULAR.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE 1,300
STORES YOU'RE IN ALREADY.
CAN YOU TURN THAT
INTO DOLLARS TO ME?
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.
MY??MY FIRST YEAR,
I HAD 450 STORES,
AND MY SALES WERE,
UM, $78,000.
AND WHAT ARE THEY THIS YEAR?
UM, CURRENTLY I'M AT $41,000,
BUT I HAD A HUGE LEARNING CURVE
ON MY PACKAGING.
I HAD TO PULL OLD PACKAGING OFF
AND PUT NEW PACKAGING ON.
WHY?
UM, MY ORIGINAL PACKAGING
WAS OFFENSIVE.
UH, I DIDN'T KNOW IT.
IT HAD HIS FACE ON IT?
IT??IT??IT WAS??IT WAS
A JAPANESE PROSTITUTE.
WHAT KIND OF A PRODUCT
WERE YOU SELLING?
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I WAS LOOKING FOR A PACKAGE
THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING,
AND SINCE I WAS A LITTLE
IGNORANT ON CULTURAL ART,
I HIRED A CHINESE ART EXPERT,
AND SHE E?MAILED ME AND SAID,
"IT IS A JAPANESE PROSTITUTE
AND VERY OFFENSIVE."
SO I HAD TO STOP MY PROJECT...
(speaks indistinctly)
SO THE WHOLE IDEA OF
HOOKER ON THE BOX DIDN'T SELL.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WELL, IT DEPENDS
ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.
YEAH, BUT ISN'T THAT
PART OF THE PROBLEM?
LEAVE THE HOOKER ASIDE
FOR A SECOND.
IS THIS A RUB?
IS THIS A SALAD DRESSING?
IS IT A FLAVORING, SEASONING?
AND THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT
POSITIONS IN THE GROCERY STORE.
TO START, I WANTED
TO DO THE DRY SALAD DRESSING
FOR THE REASON??
IT WAS A LOW START?UP COST
AND THERE'S NO COMPETITION.
DORENE, YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF A MIXED MESSAGE,
AS I'M SEEING IT.
I SEE CHEF IN BLACK
AND I SEE JADEN.
UH, WHERE IS YOUR FOCUS
ON BUILDING THE BRAND HERE?
THE BRAND IS
THE CHEF IN BLACK.
WHY NOT CALL
THE COMPANY JADEN?
BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.
I HAVE A MEXICAN CAESAR
I'M WORKING ON.
I HAVE SOME VERY UNIQUE THINGS
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE...
SO WHAT ARE YOU??
A WHOLE BRAND.
WHAT ARE YOU PROMOTING THEN??
THE JADEN NAME
OR THE CHEF IN BLACK NAME?
THE CHEF IN BLACK
IS MY COMPANY.
(O'Leary) JADEN'S THE PRODUCT.
CHEF IN BLACK'S THE COMPANY.
IF YOU HAD A FOCUS
OF??OF ONE BRAND, ONE PRODUCT,
AND YOU??AND YOU BUILT
THAT BRAND,
AND THEN YOU STARTED LAUNCHING
SOME OF THESE OTHER PRODUCTS,
I COULD SEE MAYBE MAKING
AN INVESTMENT IN THAT KIND
OF A BUSINESS CONCEPT, BUT IT'S
JUST TOO CONFUSING FOR ME,
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH,
BUT I'M OUT.
I THINK KEVIN REALLY HIT??
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.
I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DEVELOP
THE ONE PRODUCT
AND??AND GO NATIONWIDE
WITH IT.
BUT I'M OUT. THANK YOU.
DORENE, I ACTUALLY CONSULT
FOR SEVERAL FOOD COMPANIES,
AND I KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS.
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL,
BUT I'M JUST A LITTLE AFRAID OF
THIS BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT,
SO I'M OUT.
DORENE, IF THIS WAS GOING TO BE
A BIG CATEGORY,
DON'T YOU THINK A LARGE FOOD
MANUFACTURING BRANDED COMPANY
WOULD CRUSH YOU
LIKE A COCKROACH?
IT WOULD BE A SLAUGHTER FEST
FOR AN INVESTOR.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT,
'CAUSE I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
EVERY TIME THERE'S INNOVATION,
IT RARELY COMES
FROM THE BIG GUY.
THE LITTLE GUY HAS ALWAYS GOT
THE CORNER ON INNOVATION.
BUT IT'S A FLAVOR.
IT'S ONE FLAVOR.
IF I REALLY WANTED TO EMULATE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN THERE,
I COULD HIRE SOME GUYS
TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU MADE IT.
I SPENT SIX MONTHS GOING
TO ASIAN GROCERY STORES,
COMING UP WITH A RECIPE
THAT IS SO COMPLEX
THAT THEY WON'T
EVER BE ABLE TO COPY IT.
IT'LL NEVER BE
AS GOOD AS THIS.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, I'M SCARED TO DEATH
OF THE FOOD CATEGORY,
BECAUSE THE DEATH RATE
IS SO HIGH.
BUT YOU HAD
ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS.
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE COME
HERE AND MAKE GREAT PITCHES,
BUT WHEN YOU START ASKING
THE QUESTIONS,
THE WHOLE THING FALLS APART.
YOU HAVEN'T ALLOWED A CRACK
IN YOUR ANSWERS YET.
OH, THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN OFFER
FOR YOUR $50,000
FOR 40% OF YOUR BUSINESS.
40%.
BUT I'D HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU
ARE COMMITTED TO THE FACT
THAT YOU HAVE CONFUSED BRANDING.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PICK ONE,
AND YOU'D HAVE TO BE COMMITTED
TO JUST SELLING THAT DRY SALAD
DRESSING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.
BECAUSE WHAT FRIGHTENS ME
IS YOU'RE MOVING TOO FAST
WITH TOO MANY THINGS,
AND THAT'S USUALLY
A FORMULA FOR DISASTER
IN ANY YOUNG BUSINESS.
AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK
ON THOSE TERMS,
I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU
AS MY PARTNER.
(clicks tongue)
WE HAVE INVESTED $300,000
IN THE COMPANY,
AND THIS RECIPE IS SO UNIQUE.
I SPENT??
SOUNDS LIKE A "NO"
COMING DOWN THE TRACK.
DORENE...
WE'VE GOT A DEAL.
(Robert) WHOO!
(Daymond) ALL RIGHT!
(Dorene) THANK YOU.
THAT WAS TENSE.
OH, I'M SO EXCITED.
WHOA. (laughs)
WOW! GOOD JOB.
OH! YAHOO!
THANK YOU. SEE, YOU'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO COPY THAT, KEVIN.
(Barbara) I SUDDENLY LOVE
THE FOOD BUSINESS.
THANK YOU, DORENE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE BEST FOOD OPERATOR
WE'VE SEEN ON THIS SHOW.
YEAH. THE BEST?TASTING DRESSING
I'VE HAD IN THIS CATEGORY.
WELL, LOOK AT YOU. MY, GOSH.
I'M LOVING IT.
SHE KNOWS HER STUFF, AND THERE'S
NO REPLACEMENT FOR THAT.
(Daymond) SHE'S A GOOD LADY.
(Robert) SHE DESERVES SUCCESS.
(Barbara) SHE'LL GET IT.
(Dorene) WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS
HOW EXCITED I AM.
TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THE SHARKS
IS JUST BEYOND
MY WILDEST DREAMS!
I CAN'T WAIT TO WORK
WITH BARBARA.
