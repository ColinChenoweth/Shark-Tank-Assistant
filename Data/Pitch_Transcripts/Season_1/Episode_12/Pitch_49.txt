HE'S SORT OF A, UH,
A?A DANDY WEEKEND DRIVER.
IS HE GOING TO REALLY HAVE
THE MERCHANT OF DEATH
ON THE FRONT OF HIS HELMET?
YES, I WOULD.
MY NAME IS ANDY SPERRY,
I LIVE IN FRANKLIN, TENNESSEE,
AND MY BUSINESS IS INKFLIP.
MY PRODUCT WILL SIMPLIFY LIFE
FOR ANYONE
WHO USES A COMPUTER PRINTER.
INKFLIP CUSTOMERS SAVE MONEY,
SAVE TIME AND DO SOMETHING GREAT
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
IT'S LIKE ONLINE MOVIE RENTAL
FOR YOUR PRINTER.
WHEN I WAS IN CORPORATE AMERICA,
I REALIZED THAT THE ONLY WAY
I WAS EVER REALLY GONNA
GET AHEAD FINANCIALLY
WAS IF I BECAME MY OWN BOSS.
AS I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE
CAN RELATE TO,
MY WIFE AND I HAVE DEALT WITH
SOME DIFFICULT FINANCIAL TIMES,
AND WE REALIZED
THAT TOGETHER AS A TEAM,
WE NEEDED TO MAKE GETTING OUT OF
DEBT A PRIORITY FOR OURSELVES
AND FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR KIDS.
I SIMPLY NEED TO GET THE WORD
OUT ABOUT THE INKFLIP SERVICE,
AND I BELIEVE
PEOPLE ARE GONNA LOVE IT.
HI. MY NAME IS ANDY SPERRY.
I AM HERE TODAY SEEKING
A $150,000 INVESTMENT
IN RETURN FOR A 20% EQUITY
POSITION IN MY COMPANY INKFLIP.
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING
THE FINAL TOUCHES ON THE BIGGEST
PRESENTATION OF MY LIFE??
UH, I WAS PRINTING THE HANDOUTS
FOR THE MEETING.
UH, THIS WAS LATE AT NIGHT.
THE MEETING WAS
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING??
UH, WHEN I CAME ACROSS
A SITUATION
THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
CAN RELATE TO??
MY PRINTER WAS OUT OF INK.
INKFLIP CUSTOMERS ALWAYS HAVE
SPARE OR BACKUP CARTRIDGES
ON HAND
IN INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED BOXES.
THE NEXT TIME THEY RUN DRY,
THEY TAKE THE INKFLIP FULL,
PUT IT IN THEIR PRINTER,
TAKE THE EMPTY,
PUT IT BACK IN THE PREPAID,
PREADDRESSED INKFLIP BOX.
THAT SIMPLY GOES
IN THE OUTGOING MAIL.
WHEN IT ARRIVES AT INKFLIP,
WE'RE GONNA REFILL
THAT CARTRIDGE
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
SEND IT BACK TO THEM
SO THAT NEXT TIME THEY RUN DRY,
THEY'VE ALREADY GOT A SPARE.
ANDY, HOW DO I GET
MY FIRST INKFLIP CARTRIDGE?
BECAUSE I JUST KNOW THAT OUR
FRIENDLY PRINTER MANUFACTURER
IS GONNA HAVE YOU ASSASSINATED.
(chuckles) UH, WE'RE??
WE'RE AN ONLINE COMPANY,
SO YOU'RE COMING TO OUR PORTAL,
AND WE ARE SENDING YOU
THAT FIRST CARTRIDGE
SO THAT YOU HAVE IT IN STOCK,
SO THAT THE FIRST TIME
YOU RUN DRY,
THEN YOU ARE IN THE LOOP.
BUT WHY WOULD THE MANUFACTURER
LET YOU TAKE AWAY THEIR REVENUE?
THEY CAN'T REQUIRE YOU
TO USE THEIR PRODUCTS.
THE REFILL PRINTER CARTRIDGE
BUSINESS IS HUGE.
IT'S??IT'S A??IT'S
A $10?BILLION BUSINESS.
DO YOU HAVE SALES?
UH, YES. NOW THIS IS A COMPANY
THAT'S ONLY BEEN UP AND GOING
FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS,
SO I HAVE $10,000 IN REVENUE.
(chuckles)
OKAY, LET'S HAVE
A VERY QUICK MATH LESSON??
WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT VERY EASY??
JUST TO FIGURE OUT
IF YOU'LL EVER MAKE ANY MONEY,
OKAY?
RIGHT ON.
HOW MANY TIMES DOES
THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER,
PER YEAR, SEND BACK
HIS INKFLIP BOX?
INDUSTRY STATISTICS SAY
THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER
IS GONNA USE
SEVEN CARTRIDGES A YEAR.
HOW MUCH MONEY PER TRIP
DO WE MAKE AT INKFLIP?
$8 TO $10.
OKAY, LET'S SAY $10, OKAY?
THAT MEANS EACH CUSTOMER'S
GONNA MAKE US $70 A YEAR.
CORRECT.
NOW HERE'S THE KILLER QUESTION,
ANDY??
WHAT IS THE COST
OF ACQUIRING THAT CUSTOMER?
THAT IS THE KILLER QUESTION,
AND I'LL BE HONEST.
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER
TO THAT, AND??AND??
WRONG ANSWER.
I'M??I??BUT I'M HERE
FOR THE EXPERTISE...
WRONG ANSWER.
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
YOU GUYS HAVE THAT.
LIGHTNING BOLT FROM SKY
COMING DOWN AT YOU.
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL IS
PREDICATED ON GETTING CUSTOMERS,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THE COST
OF GETTING THOSE CUSTOMERS.
THE ONE NUMBER
YOU NEEDED HERE TODAY
WAS THE COST
OF ACQUIRING A CUSTOMER.
NOW YOU'VE BEEN HONEST.
YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER.
RIGHT. BUT I'M??I'M HERE TODAY
BECAUSE I NEED MONEY
TO SPEND ON MARKETING
AND ADVERTISING.
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU PUT
INTO IT SO FAR, ANDY?
I PERSONALLY HAVE ABOUT
$50,000 INTO IT.
BUT, ANDY, THINK ABOUT THAT.
YOU'RE SAYING, "MR. SHARK,
"GIVE ME $150,000 SO I CAN GO
FIND OUT THE ANSWER
TO THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION
IN MY LIFE."
NOW WHAT HAPPENS
IF THE ANSWER COMES OUT,
AND IT'S $250
TO ACQUIRE THE CUSTOMER?
(laughs) WELL, I MEAN,
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ON THAT SIDE
OF THE TABLE, AND YOU??YOU HAVE
THE OPTION TO TAKE THE RISK
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE
THE RISK THAT I DON'T HAVE.
ANDY, HERE'S THE THING??
I LIKE TO TAKE RISKS.
THAT'S HOW I MAKE MONEY.
BUT THEY'RE CALCULATED RISKS.
UNFORTUNATELY, WITHOUT KNOWING
THE ANSWER TO THAT NUMBER??
THE ONLY NUMBER THAT MATTERS??
YOU'RE A CRAPSHOOT.
I'M ROLLING THE DICE.
THE NUMBER??
WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE, IT'LL BE
BURNED ON YOUR HEINIE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT NUMBER.
THAT'S WHY I'M OUT.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
ENOUGH EDUCATION.
THERE'S NO PROPRIETARY
PRODUCTS IN HERE. I'M OUT.
ANDY, IT'S TOO RISKY FOR ME,
SO I'M OUT.
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD START A BUSINESS,
TEST THE MARKET
AND THEN GO OUT
AND TRY TO EXPAND?
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT
COMPLETELY BACKWARDS.
YOU'RE GONNA USE MY MONEY
TO TEST THE MARKET? IT'S CRAZY.
ANDY, GOOD GUY,
MAYBE NAIVE GUY.
I DON'T KNOW.
BAD PLAN. I'M OUT.
I'M THINKING OF $150,000,
AND HOW I HAD TO KILL MYSELF
TO GET MY HANDS ON IT,
AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE
ME GIVING YOU THAT MONEY
JUST TO SEE
IF THIS IDEA MIGHT WORK.
YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.
AND I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, ALL.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
WHAT DID YOU LEARN HERE TODAY,
ANDY?
WELL, I?I CERTAINLY
LEARNED, UM...
BY THE WAY, I KNEW THAT WAS
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM, COMING IN.
WHAT I LEARNED IS THAT THE THING
THAT'S IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD
THAT'S SAYING "DON'T GO
IN WITHOUT THIS" IS
IS THE THING THAT YOU NEED TO
WORK ON MOST. AND HONESTLY...
BINGO!
IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY FAMILY
AT A POINT WHERE, YOU KNOW,
WE JUST CAN'T GO
ANY FURTHER WITH THIS,
THEN I WOULD HAVE
THAT ANSWER FOR YOU.
BUT I WASN'T WILLING TO??TO GO
ANY DEEPER FINANCIALLY,
UH, WHERE MY FAMILY
IS CONCERNED.
SMART MOVE.
SO...
BUT GO OUT, WORK HARD.
I LIKE THE FACT
YOU'RE NOT RISKING YOUR FAMILY.
BUT YOU CAN GET THERE.
YOU KNOW, YOU??YOU CAN ALWAYS
GO DOWN THE ROAD IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE THE JOURNEY.
IT JUST MIGHT BE
A LITTLE LONGER.
RIGHT. THANK YOU.
(Robert) GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL.
WELL, THANKS FOR NOT BEING
SO MEAN ON THIS GUY TODAY.
I WASN'T MEAN TO HIM.
I WAS JUST HONEST.
NO, YOU WEREN'T.
I'M??I'M CONGRATULATING YOU.
BARBARA, FROM NOW ON,
I WISH YOU TO ADDRESS ME
AS THE "MERCHANT OF TRUTH."
OH.
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, FOLKS??
IF YOU'RE GONNA MEET
WITH THE SHARKS,
YOU BETTER DO YOUR HOMEWORK.
