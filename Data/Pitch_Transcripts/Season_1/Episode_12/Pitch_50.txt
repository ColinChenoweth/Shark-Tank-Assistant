HI, MY NAME IS
MICHAEL BARNETT.
AND I'M HIS WIFE BABZ,
AND WE HAVE CREATED
A MAGICAL, WHIMSICAL PLACE
WHERE PARENTS CAN
BRING THEIR CHILDREN
FOR BONDING AND LEARNING.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. HERE WE GO.
WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,
WHEN I WAS TAKING
OUR TWO YOUNG CHILDREN
HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE FOR
DIFFERENT MOMMY AND ME CLASSES.
I NEEDED EVERYTHING
UNDER ONE ROOF,
SO THAT'S WHEN WE CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA FOR ROMP N' ROLL.
WELCOME TO ROMP N' ROLL!
(cheering)
ROMP N' ROLL IS A CHILDREN'S
ENRICHMENT CENTER.
WE OFFER OVER 20 DIFFERENT
CLASSES EVERY WEEK
IN THE AREAS OF GYM,
ART AND MUSIC.
OTHER PLACES WERE A LITTLE
UNKEMPT AND KINDA OUTDATED.
WE WANTED TO CREATE A PLACE
THAT WAS CLEAN, VIBRANT,
COLORFUL AND A PLACE
WHERE PARENTS COULD SPEND
GOOD, QUALITY ONE?ON?ONE TIME
WITH THEIR KIDS.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE
TEN ROMP N' ROLL LOCATIONS,
FROM PENNSYLVANIA
TO PUERTO RICO,
AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE
$4 MILLION IN REVENUE
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.
OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE
A ROMP N' ROLL
IN EVERY COMMUNITY
ACROSS THE WORLD,
AND WE NEED THE SHARKS' HELP
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL BARNETT.
THIS IS MY WIFE BABZ.
HI, SHARKS.
AND WE ARE THE FOUNDERS
OF ROMP N' ROLL.
WE ARE HERE TODAY SEEKING
AN INVESTMENT OF $300,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF THE EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
ROMP N' ROLL IS
A GROWING CHAIN
OF CHILDREN'S PLAY
AND LEARNING CENTERS
WITH MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.
ROMP N' ROLL??A COLORFUL,
CREATIVE, WHIMSICAL ENVIRONMENT
THAT PARENTS CAN TAKE
THEIR CHILDREN
FOR GYM, ART AND MUSIC CLASSES
ALL UNDER ONE ROOF.
IN FACT, OUR TAGLINE
IS "NURTURE THE GENIUS,
UNLEASH THE GOOFBALL."
WE HAVE
SO MANY EXCITING CLASSES
THAT YOU CAN BRING YOUR CHILD,
EVERY WEEK TO ROMP N' ROLL,
FROM THE TIME THEY'RE
3 MONTHS TO 6 YEARS OLD,
AND NEVER TAKE
THE SAME CLASS TWICE.
BABZ, I'M SO EXCITED. I WANT
TO GO. IS THERE ADULT CLASSES?
WE GET THAT QUESTION A LOT.
(laughs)
THE FUN PART ABOUT IT IS,
YOU DO THESE CLASSES
WITH YOUR CHILDREN.
HOW DIFFERENT FROM GYMBOREE
IS??IS YOUR CONCEPT?
WELL, HAVE ANY OF YOU BEEN
TO A GYMBOREE?
YES, I HAVE, MANY TIMES.
OKAY, WELL, CAN I GIVE YOU
AN ANALOGY?
YEAH.
GYMBOREE??THE CASSETTE PLAYER,
ROMP N' ROLL??THE MP3 PLAYER.
YES?
DO YOU HAVE SALES? HOW MANY,
UH, HOW MANY LOCATIONS?
YEAH, WE HAVE TEN LOCATIONS.
WE HAVE TWO CORPORATE STORES,
AND THEN WE STARTED FRANCHISING.
SO WE DO HAVE
EIGHT FRANCHISE LOCATIONS.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR WAS $1.2 MILLION.
AND WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT
ON THAT?
UH, ABOUT 30%.
(O'Leary) DOES THAT INCLUDE??
INCLUDING YOUR SALARIES?
NO.
(O'Leary)
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT,
WHAT IS THE COST
OF ACQUIRING EACH CUSTOMER?
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
YOU EXIST.
RIGHT.
(O'Leary) WHAT DO YOU DO?
WE REACH OUT
TO A LOT OF THE MOMS' GROUPS,
BECAUSE THE MOMMY MARKETING
IS STRONGER
THAN ANY PRINT AD
OR ANY TV SHOW THAT YOU CAN DO.
MICHAEL, WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR SALES GO TO MARKETING?
ABOUT 1%.
THAT'S ALL?
DON'T YOU THINK, AS YOU EXPAND
BEYOND YOUR BASE OF VIRGINIA,
THAT THAT WOULD HAVE TO
GO UP SUBSTANTIALLY?
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S ADMIRABLE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
BUT WHAT BOTHERS ME
ABOUT THE BUSINESS MODEL??
YOU'RE SPENDING 1% OF SALES
ON MARKETING.
I CAN'T POINT
TO ANY FRANCHISE MODEL
THAT IS SUPPORTED
BY 1% IN MARKETING.
I THINK THAT YOU'RE DOWNPLAYING
THE PASSION THAT PARENTS HAVE
FOR A QUALITY PROGRAM THAT
COMBINES EDUCATION AND PLAY.
NO, I?I?I BUY THAT. THERE'S??
I??LOOK, I USED TO SELL SOFTWARE
TO MOTHERS OF CHILDREN
SO THEY COULD LEARN HOW TO READ,
AND I'D SAY TO THEM, "LOOK,
IF YOU DON'T BUY MY SOFTWARE,
THEY'RE GONNA LIVE IN A GUTTER
WHEN THEY GET OLD."
WELL, THAT WAS A GREAT SALES
PITCH. BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL.
IT WORKS. WE SOLD A BILLION
DOLLARS OF IT, BARBARA,
LEARNING HOW TO PLAY
THOSE EMOTIONS.
THAT'S A WONDERFUL WAY
TO TALK TO CHILDREN, KEVIN.
I HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS
AN INVESTOR, AND SAY TO MYSELF,
IS THAT REALLY GONNA WORK
IN THE LONG RUN?
THERE ARE
SOME TROUBLING SIGNS.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THERE'S SOME AMAZING GROWTH.
I'M IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR BUSINESS,
BUT MY GUT TELLS ME
THE BUSINESS MODEL ISN'T BAKED,
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I'M OUT.
UM, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO BUILD A NATIONAL BRAND
VERY QUICKLY,
SO ON THAT BASIS, I?I'M OUT.
(Robert)
BABZ, WHAT'S YOUR??WHICH??
CAN I SPEAK TO THAT?
ARE YOU??
MAYBE CHANGE YOUR MIND?
I'M??I'M STILL OUT.
I HAVE A 3 1/2 YEAR OLD
THAT I TAKE TO GYMBOREE CLASSES
TWICE A WEEK.
UNLUCKY FOR YOU... (chuckles)
THE ONE I USED TO GO TO
RECENTLY CLOSED,
AND NOW I HAVE TO WALK
AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT BLOCKS
IN NEW YORK CITY
TO GET HER TO THE NEXT ONE,
AND I DON'T BOTHER.
AND SO I'VE HAD
THE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE
OF SEEING A FAILURE RECENTLY,
AND I CAN'T GET OVER
THAT HURDLE.
SADLY, I, TOO, MUST BE OUT.
BABZ, WHY NOT A DAY CARE?
BARBARA, I HAVE TO CO??
I CAN'T STAND THAT YOU ARE
COMPARING, UH, YOUR EXPERIENCE
AT GYMBOREE TO ROMP N' ROLL.
THAT??
I HATE THAT YOU'RE MAKING
A JUDGMENT ON OURS
BASED UPON THAT ONE CLOSING
IN MANHATTAN.
I DON'T THINK
YOU MADE IT CLEAR, THOUGH,
WHAT THE POINT OF DIFFERENCE IS,
REALLY, STILL, IN MY MIND.
MM?HMM.
WELL...
CAN WE TRY AGAIN?
THE BIGGEST THING IS
THE VARIETY OF CLASSES.
AT ROMP N' ROLL, THEY DO 12
WEEKS, THEN THEY GO ON TO GYM,
THEN THEY GO ON
TO A PRINCESS CLASS,
THEN THEY GO ON
TO AN ART CLASS.
WE CAN KEEP THEM COMING BACK
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.
AND WHAT'S NICE, IF THEY JUST
WANT TO STAY IN OUR GYM CLASS,
EVERY WEEK
IS A DIFFERENT THEME.
EVERY WEEK, THE EQUIPMENT
IS COMPLETELY SWITCHED AROUND.
BABZ, H?HOW MANY, UH,
HOW MANY SHARKS ARE IN
AND HOW MANY SHARKS ARE OUT?
I THINK YOU'RE ALL STILL IN.
I THINK YOU'RE ALL
STILL INTERESTED. (laughs)
NO, NO, BUT ALL??
ALL JOKING ASIDE.
THERE'S ONE THAT IS
STILL A POSSIBILITY.
I MEAN, THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE
THAT ARE CLEARLY OUT.
I'M IN, BUT ALL YOUR ENERGY
IS GOING THAT WAY.
I'M JUST CONFUSED.
WELL, WE WANTED
TO DEFEND OUR POINTS.
ROBERT, WE'LL STOP
DOING THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE SO MUCH PASSION
FOR OUR BUSINESS,
WE CAN'T STAND TO HAVE SOMEBODY
TELL US THAT THEY DON'T...
I RESPE??I RES??
I HAPPEN TO RESPECT SOMEBODY
THAT A NO IS A DEFINITE MAYBE.
(chuckles)
SO WHAT OTHER QUESTIONS
CAN WE ANSWER?
UM...
MAYBE??MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,
DAYMOND. UH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
A GOOD ENTREPRENEUR NEVER TAKES
NO FOR AN ANSWER,
BUT A SMART BUSINESSMAN
KNOWS WHEN TO MOVE ON.
SO IT'S FEELING A LITTLE TENSE
IN THIS ROOM,
WHEN I??(laughs)
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU WHY??
BECAUSE VERY FEW PEOPLE
CAN COME IN HERE
AND TALK ABOUT MILLIONS IN SALES
AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF CASH FLOW.
I WAS ON THE VERGE
OF MAKING YOU AN OFFER,
AND YOU COMPLETELY DIVERTED
YOUR ENERGY AWAY.
SO NOW MY CONCERN IS, ARE YOU
GONNA STAY FOCUSED ENOUGH?
WE'VE LEFT TWO HIGH?PAYING JOBS
IN CORPORATE AMERICA,
WE'VE SOLD OUR BEACH HOUSE
AND WE'VE INVESTED ALMOST ALL
OF OUR CAPITAL IN THIS COMPANY.
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE A QUICK NO
WITHOUT PUSHING BACK,
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DON'T AGREE
WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE A QUICK NO
WITHOUT PUSHING BACK,
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DON'T AGREE
WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
YOU HAVE ENOUGH
OF A REAL BUSINESS
THAT I'M GENUINELY INTERESTED.
HAVING SAID THAT,
I THINK THIS IS GONNA REQUIRE
MORE OF MY TIME.
BASED ON THE NUMBERS,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $300,000
FOR 51% OF THE BUSINESS.
CAN WE TAKE A MOMENT?
CAN WE TAKE A MINUTE?
ALL RIGHT.
(Michael) THERE IS NO WAY
THAT WE'RE GONNA
GIVE THEM THE COMPANY FOR 50%.
OF COURSE NOT. NOT FOR THAT.
WE CAN LET THEM THINK THAT
FOR A FEW MINUTES. (laughs)
YEAH, EXACTLY.
I COULDN'T DISAGREE
WITH WHAT THEY SAID MORE.
WE ARE EXCELLENT MANAGERS, WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH CORPORATE AMERICA.
FOCUSED BEYOND??I MEAN, I DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE GOT THAT FROM.
ALL RIGHT, SHOULD WE
TAKE ONE MORE SHOT...
LET'S TAKE ONE MORE SHOT.
AND COUNTER AT 20%?
ROBERT,
I MADE ALL OF MY MONEY
SELLING HOPE TO PARENTS
FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
THIS HAS SOME OF THAT MAGIC
IN IT. I TELL YOU WHAT.
I WOULD GO 50/50 WITH YOU
ON A CONTROL POSITION.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH
ANYWAYS.
I AM COMPLETELY OUT
IF IT'S NOT CONTROL.
YES, I'LL BRING YOU IN.
ALL RIGHT,
WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
AND, UM, I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T
FULLY EXPLAINED OUR COMPANY??
BABZ, BEFORE??I DON'T MEAN
TO CUT YOU OFF,
BUT, UH, WHILE YOU WERE OUT,
THE SHARKS TALKED ABOUT IT.
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,
KEVIN IS HAPPY TO COME IN,
SO OUR OFFER COMBINED IS
$300,000
FOR 51% OF THE BUSINESS,
BECAUSE I THINK
THAT'S REALLY KEY TO ME,
TO MAINTAIN CONTROL.
WELL, AGAIN, I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND
OUR BUSINESS.
WAIT. DON'T SAY THAT.
<i>I</i> KNOW YOUR BUSINESS.
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY ELSE
IN YOUR SPHERE OF CONTACTS
THAT'S EVER SOLD AN EDUCATIONAL
BUSINESS FOR OVER $3 BILLION?
DO YOU?
WE DO NOT.
(Robert) SO, BABZ, YOUR??
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ONE
RIGHT HERE.
WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THIS
ALL DAY LONG.
ARE THESE GUYS
GONNA GIVE YOU AN ANSWER?
WHAT WAS
YOUR ANSWER, BABZ?
(O'Leary) WHAT DO YOU SAY?
RESPECTFULLY, WE'D LIKE
TO COUNTEROFFER, UM, AT 20%.
51% OF OUR BUSINESS, UM,
AFTER WHAT WE'VE PUT INTO IT
AND WHERE WE ARE
AFTER FIVE YEARS,
I DON'T THINK
IS A FAIR OFFER.
WE ARE NOT WILLING
TO GIVE THAT UP.
SO YOUR??YOUR COUNTEROFFER
IS WHAT?
20%.
FOR $300,000?
CORRECT.
SO YOU THINK THAT THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH $1.5 MILLION TODAY?
WE THINK IT'S WORTH $3 MILLION,
BUT WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU
AND??
IT'S NOT WORTH $3 MILLION,
NOT IN TODAY'S WORLD.
WELL,
THAT'S WHERE WE DISAGREE.
THE RISK IS TOO HIGH.
I CAN'T SEE HOW
I'D GET MY MONEY BACK AT 20%.
I STICK TO MY ORIGINAL OFFER.
NO?
NO, THANK YOU.
NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.
(Babz chuckles)
NOT EVEN MAYBE.
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW??
WELL, I'M??I'M OUT.
OVER TO YOU.
I'M VERY FRUSTRATED
WITH YOU GUYS, I GOTTA TELL YOU.
WHY?
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO SELL THE FUTURE
IN A WAY THAT NO INVESTOR
WOULD PAY FOR.
THE WORLD'S CHANGED.
YOU CAN'T GET THAT LOAN
FROM A BANK,
OR YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IT.
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.
IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU... AND FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
GOOD LUCK.
I LIKED IT A LOT.
I LIKED IT A LOT. I REALLY DID.
(Robert) THEY HAVE TO GO
TO THE BANKS.
IT WAS A GREAT BUSINESS.
THE VALUE WAS CRAZY.
IT WAS A GREAT BUSINESS.
WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE
PUT INTO THIS COMPANY??
FIVE YEARS
OF FULL?TIME DEDICATION
AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE
ALREADY GOT TEN LOCATIONS??
AND THEY THINK WE'RE ONLY
WORTH $600,000?
THEY'RE WAY OFF THE MARK.
IT'S INSANE.
I THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.
IS THAT A YES?
I ACCEPT YOUR DEAL.
IT'S A CRAZY DEAL...
IT'S NOT A CRAZY DEAL AT ALL.
BUT CRAZIER THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED. THANK YOU.
