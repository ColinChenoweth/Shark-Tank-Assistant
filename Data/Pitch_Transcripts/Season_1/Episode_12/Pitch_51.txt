ROMP N' ROLL IS A CHILDREN'S
ENRICHMENT CENTER.
WE OFFER OVER 20 DIFFERENT
CLASSES EVERY WEEK
GOOD, QUALITY ONE?ON?ONE TIME
WITH THEIR KIDS.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE
TEN ROMP N' ROLL LOCATIONS,
FROM PENNSYLVANIA
TO PUERTO RICO,
FROM THE TIME THEY'RE
3 MONTHS TO 6 YEARS OLD,
WELL, HAVE ANY OF YOU BEEN
TO A GYMBOREE?
YES, I HAVE, MANY TIMES.
OKAY, WELL, CAN I GIVE YOU
AN ANALOGY?
YEAH.
GYMBOREE??THE CASSETTE PLAYER,
ROMP N' ROLL??THE MP3 PLAYER.
YES?
DO YOU HAVE SALES? HOW MANY,
UH, HOW MANY LOCATIONS?
YEAH, WE HAVE TEN LOCATIONS.
I THINK THIS IS GONNA REQUIRE
MORE OF MY TIME.
BASED ON THE NUMBERS,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $300,000
FOR 51% OF THE BUSINESS.
CAN WE TAKE A MOMENT?
CAN WE TAKE A MINUTE?
ALL RIGHT.
(Michael) THERE IS NO WAY
THAT WE'RE GONNA
GIVE THEM THE COMPANY FOR 50%.
OF COURSE NOT. NOT FOR THAT.
WE CAN LET THEM THINK THAT
FOR A FEW MINUTES. (laughs)
YEAH, EXACTLY.
I COULDN'T DISAGREE
WITH WHAT THEY SAID MORE.
WE ARE EXCELLENT MANAGERS, WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH CORPORATE AMERICA.
FOCUSED BEYOND??I MEAN, I DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE GOT THAT FROM.
ALL RIGHT, SHOULD WE
TAKE ONE MORE SHOT...
FIVE YEARS
OF FULL?TIME DEDICATION
ONLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WATCHING. TAKE YOUR TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
THE OPTIMISM, THE EXCITEMENT,
I LIKE THE HELMET, I PUT IT ON??
FOR THIS,
I'M OFFERING 40% EQUITY.
BEING A LONGTIME GOLFER,
ONE THING I'VE FOUND
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
IS GOLFERS LOVE TO PLAY
WITH A CLEAN GOLF BALL.
KNOW THAT THEY LOVE TO PLAY
GOLF. THEY GO OUT ALL THE TIME
MAYBE HE'S A BETTER PARTNER
THAN YOU THINK.
ENGINEERING?WISE,
IT'S FANTASTIC.
(Harrington) TOO WELL MADE.
I DON'T GET IT. I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'D HAUL THAT AROUND.
IT TAKES TOO LONG TO SCREW ON.
I KNOW I GOT A GREAT PRODUCT.
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE TYCOONS DON'T WANT
TO SPEND THEIR MONEY
ON SOMETHING,
THE TYCOONS DON'T SPEND
THEIR MONEY ON SOMETHING.
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ROAD.
THERE WAS ONE TIME
I WAS GOING TO PREPARE
ONE OF MY KIDS' FAVORITE DISHES,
THAT IS EXACTLY, UM,
A VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERN,
'CAUSE I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
EVERY TIME THERE'S INNOVATION,
IT RARELY COMES
FROM THE BIG GUY.
THE LITTLE GUY HAS ALWAYS GOT
THE CORNER ON INNOVATION.
BUT IT'S A FLAVOR.
IT'S ONE FLAVOR.
IF I REALLY WANTED TO EMULATE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN THERE,
I COULD HIRE SOME GUYS
TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU MADE IT.
I SPENT SIX MONTHS GOING
TO ASIAN GROCERY STORES,
COMING UP WITH A RECIPE
THAT IS SO COMPLEX
THAT THEY WON'T
EVER BE ABLE TO COPY IT.
IT'LL NEVER BE
AS GOOD AS THIS.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, I'M SCARED TO DEATH
OF THE FOOD CATEGORY,
BECAUSE THE DEATH RATE
IS SO HIGH.
BUT YOU HAD
ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS.
TO JUST SELLING THAT DRY SALAD
DRESSING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.
BECAUSE WHAT FRIGHTENS ME
IS YOU'RE MOVING TOO FAST
WITH TOO MANY THINGS,
SO THAT YOU HAVE IT IN STOCK,
SO THAT THE FIRST TIME
YOU RUN DRY,
THEN YOU ARE IN THE LOOP.
BUT WHY WOULD THE MANUFACTURER
LET YOU TAKE AWAY THEIR REVENUE?
THEY CAN'T REQUIRE YOU
TO USE THEIR PRODUCTS.
THE REFILL PRINTER CARTRIDGE
BUSINESS IS HUGE.
IT'S??IT'S A??IT'S
A $10?BILLION BUSINESS.
DO YOU HAVE SALES?
HOW MANY TIMES DOES
THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER,
PER YEAR, SEND BACK
HIS INKFLIP BOX?
INDUSTRY STATISTICS SAY
THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER
IS GONNA USE
SEVEN CARTRIDGES A YEAR.
HOW MUCH MONEY PER TRIP
DO WE MAKE AT INKFLIP?
$8 TO $10.
OKAY, LET'S SAY $10, OKAY?
THAT MEANS EACH CUSTOMER'S
GONNA MAKE US $70 A YEAR.
CORRECT.
THANK YOU, ALL.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
