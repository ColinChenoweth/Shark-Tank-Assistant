MY NAME IS ALFONZO DOWE, SR.,
AND MY PRODUCT IS THE TWISTER
PORTABLE GOLF BALL CLEANER.
I'M HERE
FOR TWO REASONS TODAY??
ONE, I'M LOOKING
FOR AN $85,000 INVESTMENT,
AND TWO, I'M LOOKING
FOR A BUSINESS PARTNER.
FOR THIS,
I'M OFFERING 40% EQUITY.
BEING A LONGTIME GOLFER,
ONE THING I'VE FOUND
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
IS GOLFERS LOVE TO PLAY
WITH A CLEAN GOLF BALL.
WHY? BECAUSE THEY PERFORM BETTER
AND THEY LAST A LOT LONGER.
GOLFERS CONTINUALLY TAKE
A WET TOWEL
AND PUT IT ON THEIR BAG
TO CLEAN THEIR GOLF BALLS
OUT ON THE COURSE.
SO I CAME UP WITH THE TWISTER
PORTABLE GOLF BALL CLEANER.
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN.
SO YOU'RE OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE
AND YOU SET UP AND YOU TAKE
A COUPLE MAGNIFICENT SHOTS.
VOILà! ONE OF 'EM LANDS
OUT ON THE GREEN.
YEAH, YOU'RE PSYCHED NOW,
BUT WHEN YOU GET UP THERE,
WHAT DO YOU ENCOUNTER?
YOU ENCOUNTER THIS HERE??
A DIRTY GOLF BALL
THAT'S FILTHY.
NOW YOU KNOW IF YOU GO
TO TRY AND MAKE THIS PUTT,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,
BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA CAUSE
YOUR BALL TO ROLL OFF?LINE.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
GO RIGHT TO YOUR BAG, YOU UNCLIP
YOU PORTABLE GOLF BALL CLEANER
AND SIMPLY UNSCREW IT.
YOU TAKE THE BALL
AND YOU PUT IT
ON THE BOTTOM HALF
FOR THE BRISTLES.
YOU TAKE THE TOP HALF
AND YOU SCREW IT BACK DOWN.
YOU GIVE IT A LITTLE SHAKE
AND THEN YOU SIMPLY TWIST
YOUR TWISTER BACK AND FORTH.
THAT CLEANS IT.
ONCE YOU'RE DONE
DOING THE TWIST,
YOU SIMPLY UNSCREW IT
ONCE AGAIN
AND YOU TAKE OUT A GOLF BALL
THAT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BRAND?NEW AGAIN.
(Daymond) FANTASTIC IDEA.
IT LOOKS GREAT.
ALFONZO...
THEY CALL ME "FONZ,"
AND I WAS THE FONZ
BEFORE THE FONZ WAS THE FONZ.
(Barbara and Robert laugh)
SO, FONZ, HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY OF THESE?
YES, I'VE SOLD SOME.
I HAVE SOLD.
WHERE DO YOU SELL 'EM, ONLINE?
WELL, I DO SELL SOME ONLINE.
PEOPLE GO TO MY WEB SITE
AND ORDER 'EM.
BUT AT THE FLEA MARKET IS
WHERE I'VE SOLD THE BULK OF IT.
(O'Leary)
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
I'VE SOLD ABOUT A COUPLE
THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH.
I HAVEN'T SOLD A LOT
BECAUSE I'M NOT A BUSINESSMAN.
SO YOU'RE NOT A BUSINESSMAN.
WHAT ARE YOU THEN?
I'M A POLICE OFFICER.
YOU'RE AN OFFICER?
I'M AN EXPERT
IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FIELD.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO USE
YOUR NIGHT STICK ON HIM
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY,
CAN YOU PLEASE ARREST ROBERT?
JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT.
AFTER ME AND YOU GET A DEAL,
YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.
(sharks laugh)
FONZ, HOW MUCH IS IT?
$19.99??UNDER $20.
(Barbara) WHOLESALE?
AND HOW MUCH DOES IT
COST YOU TO MAKE?
$6.
I GET PITCHED A LOT
OF KOOKY GOLF STUFF.
(Daymond) RIGHT.
IT IS REALLY WELL?MADE.
I MEAN??
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S VERY FUNCTIONAL.
DO YOU HAVE IT AT ANY RETAILERS?
NO, I DON'T HAVE IT IN ANY.
WHY ISN'T IT?
MY TIME IS VERY LIMITED,
AND I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME
WHERE I COULD PRESENT THIS
BEFORE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU,
A BUSINESS PARTNER.
HEY, ALFONZO, I'VE SOLD
SOME GOLF PRODUCTS BEFORE...
MM?HMM.
AND I LIKE TO SELL SOMETHING
THAT WILL IMPROVE MY SCORE.
RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW THAT??
CAN I OFFER YOU SOMETHING?
(Harrington) YEAH.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT
FROM A GOLFER'S STANDPOINT.
FONZ, EXACTLY.
THERE'S THE RUB.
OKAY.
YOUR MARKET, IN FACT,
IS NOT THE GOLFER.
LET ME TRY??
I WANT TO EDUCATE YOU.
THERE ARE 68 MILLION GOLFERS
IN THE WORLD.
THERE ARE 68 BILLION LOVED ONES
WHO LOVE THAT GOLFER,
KNOW THAT THEY LOVE TO PLAY
GOLF. THEY GO OUT ALL THE TIME
AND BUY THEM NEW STUFF BECAUSE
THEY KNOW THEY LIKE GOLF.
FAIR ENOUGH.
IT'S TRUE. I'D BUY IT FOR
MY HUSBAND. HE'S A GOLF NUT.
THEY WILL SEE THIS AND SAY,
"THAT'S A GREAT PRESENT
FOR MY"??
GUESS WHAT. THAT MEANS IT'S
A SEASONAL GOLF PRODUCT THEN.
SO YOU'RE GONNA SELL SOME
AT CHRISTMAS MAYBE...
NO, THERE'S??
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SELL 'EM YEAR?ROUND.
THERE'S BIRTHDAYS,
THERE'S FATHER'S DAYS,
THERE'S GOLF OUTINGS,
GIVEAWAYS, CORPORATE LOGOS.
I'M OUT.
(Barbara) I'VE BEEN DRAGGED
TO A LOT OF CORPORATE
GOLF OUTINGS WITH MY HUSBAND.
I HATE EVERY
MINUTE OF GOLF, I MUST SAY,
SO I HAVE A BAD EYE ON THIS.
MM?HMM.
BUT I SEE TONS OF
PROMOTIONAL STUFF GIVEN OUT.
(Daymond) YEAH.
NOW I SEE THIS AS A CORPORATE
PROMOTIONAL ITEM EASILY.
I?I AGREE.
BARBARA, THAT'S A TCHOTCHKE.
IT'S A TCHOTCHKE,
BUT THEY'LL BUY A LOT OF THEM.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
HOWEVER, I HATE GOLF.
SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE,
I'M OUT.
FONZ, WHERE ARE YOU
A POLICE OFFICER? WHICH CITY?
I LIVE IN NEW JERSEY,
BUT I WORK IN DELAWARE.
SO PLEASE DON'T ARREST ME
FOR SPEEDING
WHEN I'M IN NEW JERSEY.
(laughs)
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
A HOLE IN ONE. I'M OUT.
I HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION??
WHAT DO YOU WANT THE MONEY FOR?
INVENTORY.
INVENTORY.
YOU NEED SALES
BEFORE YOU BUY INVENTORY.
YOU NEED AN ORDER
FROM SOMEBODY.
YOU'D BE IN A BETTER SITUATION
IF SOMEBODY SAID,
"LOOK, FONZ.
HERE'S AN ORDER FOR 10,000,"
AND THEN IF YOU CAME IN HERE
AND SAID, "WELL, UNCLE KEVIN,
I'VE GOT A 10,000 ORDER I CAN'T
FINANCE," I'D BE ALL OVER IT.
MM?HMM.
BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
I'M A SIMPLE GUY.
BUT I CAN'T,
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
FONZ, I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS SPORT,
AND I HAVE TO LISTEN TO MY GUT
AND SAY THAT RESPECTFULLY,
I'M OUT.
I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME,
AND I REALLY VALUE IT.
(sharks) THANK YOU.
GOOD DAY.
FONZ, CAN I BUY ONE?
CAN YOU BUY ONE?
YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.
ALL RIGHT. THANK??
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
A SPECIAL PRICE??$19.99.
(sharks laugh)
MAYBE HE'S A BETTER PARTNER
THAN YOU THINK.
ENGINEERING?WISE,
IT'S FANTASTIC.
(Harrington) TOO WELL MADE.
I DON'T GET IT. I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'D HAUL THAT AROUND.
IT TAKES TOO LONG TO SCREW ON.
I KNOW I GOT A GREAT PRODUCT.
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE TYCOONS DON'T WANT
TO SPEND THEIR MONEY
ON SOMETHING,
THE TYCOONS DON'T SPEND
THEIR MONEY ON SOMETHING.
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ROAD.
