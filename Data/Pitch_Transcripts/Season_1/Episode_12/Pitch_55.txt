WELL, WE WANT TO DOMINATE
THAT INDUSTRY.
BUT IF WE COULD STRUCTURE
A DEAL...
MM?HMM.
WHERE WE LICENSE IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE,
WE NEVER HAVE
TO MAKE A SINGLE ONE...
RIGHT.
AND YOU COLLECT
A PERCENTAGE OF A ROYALTY
OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS...
SURE.
ARE YOU MORE INTERESTED
IN DOING THAT
OR ARE YOU MORE INTERESTED...
WELL, WE WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.
WE WANT YOUR EXPERTISE.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I??
I'LL DO??I'LL DO FOR YOU.
YES?
NORMALLY I WOULD ASK
FOR 51% OR 70%
TO TAKE ON ALL THIS,
BUT WHAT I'LL DO FOR YOU IS,
I'LL GO 50/50 WITH YOU.
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY,
I WILL GIVE YOU THE $500,000,
AND MY OBJECTIVE
AT THE END OF THE DAY
IS TO LICENSE THIS
TO A BUNCH OF COMPANIES.
CAN I ASK THIS??
WILL IT??WILL IT HAVE
THE SAME DETAIL
AND THE??THE ARTISTIC
PROPERTIES?
WE WILL BE PARTNERS, AND WE WILL
MAKE THIS DECISION TOGETHER.
AND ALL THE ASPECTS THAT MAKE
THIS GREAT WILL NEED TO BE THERE
OR IT'S NOT WORTH IT FOR ME.
MARIX, JUST SO YOU KNOW
WHERE I STAND...
I'M GONNA BE OUT. HIS
OFFER IS BETTER THAN MINE.
I WAS GONNA OFFER YOU
$500,000 FOR 75%,
BUT HIS OFFER IS BETTER
AS A STARTING POINT.
THANK YOU.
SO, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WE'RE EXCITED TO GET
INTO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
WE THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER
AND BUILD
A BILLION?DOLLAR BRAND.
WELL, IS THAT A YES?
YES.
YOU BETCHA.
IT'S A YES ON MY SIDE.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE EXCITED. BYE.
(Marix) THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BYE.
WE'VE MADE A GOOD DEAL. I THINK
DAYMOND IS THE RIGHT PERSON.
HE'S INVOLVED WITH
A GOOD HISTORY OF BRANDING
AND??AND SALES, SO I THINK
HE'S GONNA WORK WITH US,
AND WE WILL??WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A BILLION?DOLLAR BRAND TOGETHER.
I MAY REGRET THAT ONE.
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL, DAYMOND.
I GOTTA ADMIT.
IT WAS SUCH A BIG ASK
WITH SO LITTLE REVENUE.
I'M SO MAD AT YOU,
I'M GONNA RIDE AWAY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BARBARA?
YOU LOOK ADORABLE,
BUT HE LOOKS RIDICULOUS.
IS GONNA HAVE YOU ASSASSINATED.
(chuckles) UH, WE'RE??
WE'RE AN ONLINE COMPANY,
SO YOU'RE COMING TO OUR PORTAL,
AND WE ARE SENDING YOU
THAT FIRST CARTRIDGE
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER.
RIGHT. BUT I'M??I'M HERE TODAY
BECAUSE I NEED MONEY
TO SPEND ON MARKETING
AND ADVERTISING.
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU PUT
INTO IT SO FAR, ANDY?
I PERSONALLY HAVE ABOUT
$50,000 INTO IT.
BUT, ANDY, THINK ABOUT THAT.
YOU'RE SAYING, "MR. SHARK,
"GIVE ME $150,000 SO I CAN GO
FIND OUT THE ANSWER
TO THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION
IN MY LIFE."
NOW WHAT HAPPENS
IF THE ANSWER COMES OUT,
AND IT'S $250
TO ACQUIRE THE CUSTOMER?
(laughs) WELL, I MEAN,
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ON THAT SIDE
OF THE TABLE, AND YOU??YOU HAVE
THE OPTION TO TAKE THE RISK
AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE
THE RISK THAT I DON'T HAVE.
ANDY, HERE'S THE THING??
I LIKE TO TAKE RISKS.
THAT'S HOW I MAKE MONEY.
BUT THEY'RE CALCULATED RISKS.
UNFORTUNATELY, WITHOUT KNOWING
THE ANSWER TO THAT NUMBER??
THE ONLY NUMBER THAT MATTERS??
YOU'RE A CRAPSHOOT.
I'M ROLLING THE DICE.
THE NUMBER??
WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE, IT'LL BE
BURNED ON YOUR HEINIE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT NUMBER.
THAT'S WHY I'M OUT.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
ENOUGH EDUCATION.
THERE'S NO PROPRIETARY
PRODUCTS IN HERE. I'M OUT.
ANDY, IT'S TOO RISKY FOR ME,
SO I'M OUT.
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD START A BUSINESS,
TEST THE MARKET
AND THEN GO OUT
AND TRY TO EXPAND?
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT
COMPLETELY BACKWARDS.
YOU'RE GONNA USE MY MONEY
TO TEST THE MARKET? IT'S CRAZY.
ANDY, GOOD GUY,
MAYBE NAIVE GUY.
I DON'T KNOW.
BAD PLAN. I'M OUT.
I'M THINKING OF $150,000,
AND HOW I HAD TO KILL MYSELF
TO GET MY HANDS ON IT,
AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE
ME GIVING YOU THAT MONEY
JUST TO SEE
IF THIS IDEA MIGHT WORK.
YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.
AND I'M OUT.
