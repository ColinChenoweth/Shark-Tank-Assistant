IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,
ALL OF THE TIME.
TO MAKE THE FACTIONIST
A MULTIMILLION?DOLLAR COMPANY,
BUT WHAT I DON'T HAVE
IS THE CAPITAL.
THAT'S WHY I NEED
TO GET IN FRONT OF THE SHARKS.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO INVEST
IN AMERICA'S FUTURE. THANK YOU.
WOW. YOU'RE GONNA SAVE
THE WORLD?
YEAH, BUT I'M GONNA
MAKE MONEY DOING IT.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,
ALL OF THE TIME.
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE LEARNED TODAY.
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THAT,
BECAUSE I THINK KEVIN, UH,
IS??IS...
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
HAS BEEN SITTING IN THE 75th
FLOOR OF HIS MONEY TOWER
FOR FAR TOO LONG.
YOU??YOU??YOU ARE GOING DOWN
THE RIGHT PATH.
OH, REALLY?
YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO BUILD A GREAT
BUSINESS. YOU GOT THE PASSION.
DON'T EVER LOSE THAT,
BECAUSE THAT'S INFECTIOUS.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
AND YOU'LL GO A LONG WAY.
THANK YOU.
I FEEL GOOD THAT I??THAT I TRIED
AS HARD AS I COULD OUT THERE.
AND I ALSO FEEL DISAPPOINTED
THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
THAT GUY WAS A GOOD KID.
EXCELLENT KID.
HE JUST HAD NOTHING.
HE HAD NO BRAND.
HE IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF WHY,
WHEN YOU DUMP ON PEOPLE,
IT'S SO DANGEROUS.
IT'S NOT DUMPING ON HIM.
LET ME JUST FINISH.
I'M TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.
ROBERT??
LET ME JUST??THIS GUY MAY BE
IN THE WRONG VEHICLE TODAY.
BUT IF HE KEEPS THAT PASSION
AND HE KEEPS THAT ENERGY,
HE'LL FIND A PATH.
THIS WAS NOT THE RIGHT PATH.
THERE'S A MILLION GUYS
WITH PASSION.
REALLY? REALLY?
YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YES, I DO.
I THINK A LOT OF BUSINESSES
HAVE FAILED
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
PASSION. THEY HAVE GREED.
WHAT DO INVESTORS WANT,
ROBERT?
WE'RE INVESTORS HERE.
WHAT DO THEY WANT?
WHAT DO THEY WANT BACK? PASSION?
TALKS ABOUT THE WORLD?
SAVING THE PLANET?
THEY WANT THEIR MONEY BACK.
I'M SORRY. WERE YOU TALKING?
'CAUSE I WASN'T LISTENING
ANYMORE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING.
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
(Robert) YEAH, WELL...
HAVE THE GUYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE?
INITIALLY, NO. THEY GAVE ME
A PRETTY HARD TIME ABOUT IT.
BUT ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 'EM??
WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS AROUND??
WOULD COME TO ME AND SAY
"HEY. HOW MUCH ARE YOU SELLING
THOSE PILLOWS FOR?
I TOLD MY WIFE ABOUT IT,
AND SHE WANTS ONE."
SO HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
WE'VE SOLD JUST SHORT
OF 6,000 UNITS.
IN HOW??IN HOW LONG
A PERIOD OF TIME?
WE'RE ALMOST AT EXACTLY
OUR 2?YEAR MARK.
HOW MUCH DO
YOU SELL THEM FOR?
THEY RETAIL FOR $29.95.
AND THEY COST
HOW MUCH TO MAKE?
MY COST, UM, IS AROUND $7.
DO YOU HAVE ANY RETAIL
OR CATALOG DISTRIBUTION AT ALL?
YES, ACTUALLY, UM,
WE'RE IN TWO OF THE??THE LARGEST
MAIL ORDER CATALOGS THERE IS??
UH, LILLIAN VERNON
AND SOLUTIONS.
BOTH HAVE SOLD OUT OF PRODUCT,
AND I'M??
AND I HAVE PURCHASE ORDERS RIGHT
NOW FROM THEM THAT I CAN'T FILL.
SO YOU'RE SAYING,
RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE ORDERS
THAT YOU CANNOT FULFILL?
THAT'S CORRECT.
HOW MANY ORDERS DO YOU HAVE?
WELL, THE TWO BIGGEST ONES ARE
BY LILLIAN VERNON AND SOLUTIONS.
THEY MADE A FAIRLY LARGE
PURCHASE IN THE SPRINGTIME.
I TOLD THEM THAT
"YOU'RE GETTING ALL I HAVE,"
AND WITHIN ABOUT
LESS THAN A MONTH,
THEY CALLED BACK AND SAID
"WE WANT TO PLACE ANOTHER P. O.,"
AND I HAD TO TELL THEM "SORRY."
LET'S BRING IT BACK
TO NUMBERS FOR A MINUTE
BECAUSE ACTUALLY,
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.
OKAY.
$250,000 FOR BASICALLY
A THIRD OF YOUR COMPANY
IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR,
RIGHT?
THAT'S CORRECT.
SO THAT'S $750,000 YOU THINK
THE WHOLE THING IS WORTH.
YOU MADE ABOUT $21,000
LAST YEAR.
YOU THINK THERE'S
A LITTLE DISLOCATION
BETWEEN WHAT YOU MADE AND WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S WORTH?
SURE. I?I?I'LL AGREE
WITH THAT STATEMENT.
BUT MY??MY??MY??
SO WHY WOULD YOU COME HERE
AND??AND ASK SO MUCH FOR?
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT THOSE NUMBERS
ARE... SMALL
BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITED ABILITY
AND??AND RESOURCES.
BUT YOU WANT ME TO PAY
AS IF YOU ALREADY HAD MY MONEY.
YOU'RE NOT LETTING ME
WET MY BEAK ON THE UPSIDE.
I GUESS IT'S A MATTER
OF PERSPECTIVE.
YEAH. FROM THIS SIDE.
RIGHT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
HOW DO WE FIX THAT?
I'M NOT SURE.
I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT,
I'M NOT A REAL NUMBERS GUY.
YEAH, THAT'S OBVIOUS.
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE
A BETTER ANSWER THAN,
"GEE, THAT'S YOUR OPINION"
TO KEVIN'S VALUE PROPOSITION.
TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE
AT GIFT?GIVING TIME,
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES
WEE CAN SHOP SO UNIQUE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE GONNA
GIFT BAG YOUR GIFTS, OKAY?
IT IS A FAMILY BUSINESS,
AND WE HAVE NO OTHER
COMPETITORS OUT THERE. WE'RE
THE FIRST AND ONLY OF ITS KIND.
OPENING WEE CAN SHOP
HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR
BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
WE TRULY BELIEVE
WEE CAN SHOP CAN BE
THE NEXT BIG RETAIL CHAIN.
I KNOW THE SHARKS
ARE GONNA LOVE US.
THEY'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY GIVE US
THE INVESTMENT WE NEED
AND THE BUSINESS KNOW?HOW
TO TAKE WEE CAN SHOP
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
"ONCE UPON A TIME,
"UPON ENTERING THE WHIMSICAL
TOWN OF WEE CAN SHOP,
"CHILDREN USE
KID?SIZE SHOPPING CARTS
"IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT GIFTS
"AND STROLL THROUGH
CHARMING STOREFRONTS.
"ONCE CHILDREN HAVE REMEMBERED
EVERYONE ON THEIR LIST,
"AND THEIR CARTS ARE FULL,
"THEIR SHOPPING EXPERIENCE
IS NOT COMPLETE
"UNTIL THEY PAY THE CASHIER
"AND GIFT BAG AND TAG
THEIR GIFTS WITH LOVE.
"THIS MAGICAL SHOPPING
EXPERIENCE CAN BECOME A REALITY
"FOR MILLIONS OF CHILDREN
ACROSS AMERICA.
"SO WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM THE SHARK TANK,
WE COULD ALL LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER."
WHAT DO YOU SELL IN THE SHOP?
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE
DIFFERENT STOREFRONTS.
MOM'S KITCHEN HAS EVERYTHING
FOR THE KITCHEN AND BAKING.
SUGAR &amp; SPICE BAKERY
IS ALL PIE?SHAPED CANDLES
AND THINGS THAT YOU BAKE WITH.
HAS ANYBODY APPROACHED YOU,
SAYING, "LISTEN. WE DON'T LIKE
THE WAY YOU'RE TEACHING CHILDREN
TO BECOME CONSUMERS
AT AN EARLY AGE"?
IS THERE A MOTHERS AGAINST
CHILD CREDIT?
I CANNOT TELL YOU
THE OVERWHELMING RESPONSE.
THEY LOVE THE EXPERIENCE
IT TEACHES THEIR CHILDREN.
IN FACT, WHEN THEY COME BACK
TIME AND TIME AGAIN,
NOW THEY START SAVING
THEIR OWN MONEY. EVERYONE??
SINCE THE DAY WE OPENED??
SAID, "YOU SHOULD FRANCHISE.
WE CAN SEE YOU IN EVERY MALL.
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?"
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN IN BUSINESS?
ABOUT THREE AND A HALF YEARS.
AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU GROSSING
EACH YEAR?
UM, EVERY YEAR WE'VE INCREASED
OUR INCOME 100%.
WHAT WAS IT LAST YEAR?
WE HAD BASICALLY $13,000.
WE DID HAVE??
OOH.
I HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH THEM.
(sniffles)
AND I THINK IT CAN SUCCEED.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
THESE PEOPLE CHEERING YOU ON.
IT'S ME.
I DON'T THINK I??I DON'T
THINK WE'RE CHEERING HER ON.
I THINK THAT??
I DON'T CARE, ROBERT.
IT MAKES NO MONEY.
YOU HAVE GOT TO
PUT A TIMELINE ON THIS
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAMILY'S MONEY
YOU'RE BURNING,
AND THAT I FIND EVIL.
I APPRECIATE
ALL OF YOUR, UM, OPINIONS,
AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
(Daymond) GOOD LUCK.
EVEN YOU GUYS WERE OFFERING HER
ENCOURAGEMENT.
NOT TRUE. NOT TRUE.
IT'S TERRIBLE.
I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE
GAVE HER FALSE ENCOURAGEMENT.
YOU KNOW, I WILL BE ABLE
TO SLEEP TONIGHT,
AND YOU WILL ALL
TOSS AND TURN.
I THINK YOU NEED PASSION
TO SUCCEED.
THERE IS NO SHORTAGE
OF PASSION IN ME
OR ANYONE INVOLVED
IN WEE CAN SHOP.
(voice breaking) SO I THINK,
YOU KNOW, OUR FUTURE IS GREAT,
AND, UM...
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
I'M TIM STANSBURY, AND THIS IS
MY BUSINESS PARTNER ERIN WHALEN.
ERIN AND I ARE BOTH
RECREATIONAL CYCLISTS.
WE MET SEVERAL YEARS AGO
THROUGH A TRAINING GROUP,
AND WE'VE BEEN CLOSE FRIENDS
EVER SINCE.
A LOT OF OUR RIDES
ARE OVER 100 MILES,
AND MANY TIMES YOU NEED TO MAKE
ON?THE?ROAD REPAIRS
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE
100?MILE BIKE RIDES
WHEN I GOT A FLAT TIRE.
TIM CAME OVER
AND HE HELPED ME FIX IT,
AND ONCE WE GOT GOING AGAIN, WE
TALKED ABOUT HAVING A SOLUTION
THAT WOULD MAKE ON?THE?ROAD
FIX?IT PROBLEMS A LOT EASIER.
AFTER DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH,
WE'VE COME UP WITH
THE PERFECT PRODUCT AND FOUND
A REALLY FUN WAY
TO MARKET IT.
GOT YOUR ORDER FOR YA.
ALL RIGHT!
BEEN WAITIN' ON THIS.
COOL.
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT OUR PRODUCT
IS, IT'S NOT JUST FOR CYCLISTS.
THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER
EVERYDAY USES FOR IT.
(Tim) I THINK THE SHARKS
ARE GONNA LOVE US.
EVERYONE THAT WE'VE EVER TALKED
TO REALLY LIKES THE PRODUCT.
WE JUST HAVE TO GET IT
IN FRONT OF THEM.
HI, I'M TIM,
AND THIS IS ERIN,
AND WE'RE WITH
GREASE MONKEY WIPES.
AND FOR $40,000,
WE'RE WILLING TO GIVE YOU
40% OF OUR COMPANY.
HAVE YOU EVER FOUND YOURSELF
COMPLETELY COVERED
IN GREASE OR GRIME
WITH NO EASY WAY TO CLEAN UP?
FOR ME, IT HAPPENED
ON A 100?MILE BIKE RIDE.
I GOT A FLAT TIRE,
AND AFTER CHANGING IT,
MY HANDS WERE COVERED IN GREASE.
I TRIED TO GET THE GREASE OFF
IN THE GRASS AND ON MY SHORTS,
BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK.
IT WAS THEN THAT TIM AND I
DECIDED IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF THERE WAS
A PORTABLE CLEANING PRODUCT
THAT WOULD EASILY REMOVE
GREASE, GRIME AND DIRT.
SO WE CREATED
GREASE MONKEY WIPES.
I'D LIKE TO PASS 'EM OUT
FOR YOU GUYS.
THANKS, ERIN.
SURE.
(Barbara) THANK YOU.
CAN I OPEN IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU.
(Tim) GREASE MONKEY WIPES
ARE INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED
DEGREASING CLEANING WIPES
THAT UTILIZE A NATURAL,
NONTOXIC CITRUS?BASED CLEANER
TO HANDLE
HEAVY?DUTY CLEANING.
OUR WIPES AREN'T ANY ORDINARY
ANTIBACTERIAL WIPE,
AS THEY'RE DESIGNED TO CLEAN
THE HEAVIEST MESSES
OF GREASE AND GRIME.
TAKE THIS NASTY, DISGUSTINGLY
GREASY CAR ENGINE PART.
NOW IF I WAS CLEANING THIS
WITH A NORMAL WET WIPE,
IT JUST WOULDN'T WORK.
THIS IS A NORMAL WET WIPE.
NASTY.
IT'S PRETTY GROSS.
(chuckles)
BUT A GREASE MONKEY WIPE
WOULD CLEAN HER UP.
(O'Leary) WHAT IS THE INGREDIENT
THAT'S BREAKING DOWN OIL?
UH, CITRUS OILS.
WHEN THEY SQUEEZE THE ORANGES
FOR ORANGE JUICE,
UH, THE LEFTOVER OILS ARE USED
AS A CLEANING AGENT.
TIM, HOW DID YOU
FIGURE THAT OUT?
UH, WE DID A LOT
OF PRODUCT TESTING
PRIOR TO THE PRODUCT LAUNCH,
AND CAME UPON ONE
THAT WE KNEW WAS NATURAL
AND WOULD BE SAFE
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
AND WASN'T HARSH CHEMICALS.
NOT ONLY CAN IT CLEAN
THE GREASE,
BUT IT CAN ALSO CLEAN PERMANENT
MARKER, PAINT AND CRAYON.
SO GREASE MONKEY WIPES
ARE PERFECT
FOR THAT MOM WHOSE KID
IS ALWAYS GETTING INTO A MESS.
ERIN, CAN YOU HOLD YOUR HAND UP?
I WANNA SEE HOW CLEAN??
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
SO I CAN SMELL THE ORANGE OIL
FROM HERE.
(Tim) CORRECT.
(Barbara) IT SMELLS GOOD.
IT'S QUITE CONCENTRATED,
ISN'T IT?
(Tim) YES.
(Erin) YEP.
IF IT'S??IF IT'S
A COMMON, UM, COMMODITY,
A DERIVATIVE
OF MAKING ORANGE JUICE,
COULDN'T I MAKE UNCLE KEVIN'S
CLEANY UPPY WIPEYS?
LIKE, WHAT STOPS ME
FROM DOING THIS?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THE PORTABLE NATURE
OF THE PRODUCT IS REALLY
OUR UNIQUE, UM,
SELLING POINT.
IS THAT PATENTED?
NO, IT IS NOT PATENTED.
IS THERE ANY PATENT HERE?
NO.
WE DECIDED NOT TO PATENT IT
REALLY FOR TWO REASONS.
ONE, WE'RE
A BRAND?NEW COMPANY,
UH, SO WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
THE RESOURCES TO PATENT IT.
AND SECOND,
ONCE YOU PATENT A PRODUCT,
YOU HAVE TO PUT, UM, BASICALLY
YOUR FORMULAS OUT THERE.
SO IT KIND OF PROTECTS US
AND, YOU KNOW,
GIVES US SOME LEAD TIME, UM,
TO GET SOME MARKET SHARE
AND GET IN THE PUBLIC MIND VIEW
BEFORE SOMEONE COULD COPY US.
DON'T THESE EXIST PRETTY MUCH
IN A LOT OF
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ALREADY?
THE OTHER STUFF IS VERY
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL HEAVY.
(Erin) RIGHT.
YEAH, THAT'S ONE OF
OUR GREATEST DIFFERENTIATOR
IS THE CITRUS FORMULA,
THE CITRUS SMELL,
NO HARSH CHEMICALS,
AND THE FACT YOU CAN BUY
ONE OR TWO AT A TIME,
THROW IT IN
YOUR GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
I LIKE THE COLOR COMBINATION
YOU HAVE THERE.
BUT IS THERE ANY TRADEMARK?
OUR LOGO IS TRADEMARKED.
(Robert) IT'S THE BEST LOGO
I'VE EVER SEEN.
(Erin and Tim) THANK YOU.
I LOVE THE BIKING SHIRT.
THANKS FOR SAYING THAT.
ACTUALLY, WE GET A GOOD RESPONSE
FROM KIDS, TOO.
ALL THIS WONDERFUL LOGO STUFF
HAS TRANSLATED
INTO WHAT IN SALES?
WE'VE ONLY HAD THE PRODUCT
ON THE MARKET FOR A FEW MONTHS,
AND WE HAVE SOLD 7,600
GREASE MONKEY WIPES.
AND HOW??WHAT??
IN DOLLARS, WHAT IS THAT?
UH, OUR GROSS REVENUE IS??
HAS BEEN $7,400.
IT'S $1 A PACKAGE?
(Erin and Tim) YES.
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S SUSTAINABLE?
WE??ACTUALLY, WE DO.
I MEAN, THERE'S 285 MILLION
REGISTERED CARS IN THE U. S.
13 MILLION BOATS
AND OVER 6 MILLION MOTORCYCLES.
SO THAT EXPONENTIALLY
GROWS OUR MARKETPLACE.
FRANKLY, WE'VE HAD
A LOT OF LUCK SO FAR
IN LITTLE NICHE MARKETS,
FOR INSTANCE, CYCLING.
WE HAVE A 75% SUCCESS RATE
OF STORES THAT WE PITCH
THIS PRODUCT TO.
SO??
AND THEN THEY REORDER
AGAIN AND AGAIN...
YES.
OR IT'S TOO YOUNG TO TELL?
UM??
WE'VE HAD APPROXIMATELY 40%
OF THE SHOPS
WE'VE SOLD INTO REORDER,
BUT A LOT OF THEM
ARE REALLY NEW
AND HAVE JUST RECEIVED
THEIR INITIAL ORDER,
SO THEY HAVEN'T
BURNED THROUGH IT.
AND SINCE WE ARE NEW, WE DON'T
HAVE THE HUGE NAME RECOGNITION
TO REALLY DRIVE, UH,
THAT PART OF THE SALES.
(Daymond) YOU GUYS,
GREAT PRESENTATION.
I LOVE THE BRANDING.
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
IT'S JUST NOT
A BUSINESS FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
(Barbara) TIM, I FEEL I'M BEING
FOOLED A LITTLE BIT,
NOT INTENTIONALLY SO,
BY THE LOOK YOU HAVE GOING ON.
YOU LOOK LIKE A GREASE MONKEY??
YOU KNOW, THE BEARD,
THE WHOLE LOOK??
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOUR,
UH, PRESENTATION'S
PRETTY BUTTONED?UP.
DO YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS BACKGROUND?
YES. I HAVE AN M. B. A.
IN MARKETING AND??
I WON'T HOLD THAT
AGAINST YOU.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
(laughs)
BEFORE DOING THIS
FULL?TIME, UH,
I'VE BEEN IN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
AND PRODUCT MARKETING,
SO I DO HAVE
A SOLID BUSINESS BACKGROUND,
WELL, JUST IN MY CARS ALONE,
WE COULD DO??
(Tim) YEAH.
(Erin laughs)
HE OWNS MOTORCYCLES,
BOATS, CARS.
THIS IS YOUR TICKET.
OH, STOP IT, BARBARA.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.
AND THE EXOTIC CARS
YOU HAVE,
THEY DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF EXTRA SPACE.
SO ONE OF THESE SMALL,
LITTLE THINGS WOULD BE PERFECT.
THAT'S TRUE.
I... (sighs)
ERIN, I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T... I?I...
YOU??YOU??
YOU DID SUCH A GREAT JOB,
AND YOU ANSWERED
ALL THE QUESTIONS.
AND, TIM, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
I JUST LOOK AT THE, UH??
(Erin) I CAN TELL YOU, ROBERT,
TIM AND I,
WE WORK GREAT TOGETHER.
I HAVE MY BACHELOR'S
IN BUSINESS. TIM HAS HIS M. B. A.
ERIN, ONE SENTENCE??WHY SHOULD I
GIVE YOU THE MONEY?
(chuckles)
I PROMISE YOU, ROBERT,
I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.
I WILL MAKE GREASE MONKEY WIPES
BE A NATIONAL,
FANTASTIC, SUCCESSFUL BRAND
AND A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY.
AND I'LL EVEN MAKE IT
AN INTERNATIONAL BRAND.
SO ALL THOSE FIGURES
WERE JUST U. S., TOO.
SO EXTRAPOLATE THAT
ACROSS THE WORLD,
AND THAT WOULD EASILY
GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
I PROMISE,
THIS IS GONNA BE FANTASTIC.
IT ALREADY IS FANTASTIC.
WHETHER YOU'RE ON BOARD, THAT'S
THE??THAT'S THE QUESTION.
ERIN AND TIM, YOU GOT
YOUR $40,000 FOR 40%.
SOUNDS EXCELLENT.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
(Erin) WE HAVE A DEAL.
(Tim) ABSOLUTELY.
(Robert) ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN COME IN.
OKAY, YOU GOT TWO OF US,
'CAUSE I WAS REGRETTING IT.
WOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.
PROMISE.
THANK YOU. GOOD JOB.
THANKS AGAIN.
WOW.
GREAT SALESPEOPLE.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(Erin) THANK YOU
SO MUCH, BARBARA.
(Barbara) BOTH OF YOU, FABULOUS.
(Erin) BYE. THANK YOU, GUYS.
(Tim) THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(Robert) GREAT JOB.
YOU ROCKED IT IN THERE, ERIN.
GREAT JOB.
WOW. THAT WAS??
WOW.
THAT WAS ONE GOOD SALESMAN.
(Barbara) WOW.
(Daymond) I WAS THINKING
ABOUT GETTING IN ALSO.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S HOW GOOD THEY WERE.
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
SHE JUST KEPT??
COMING BACK AND COMING BACK.
THAT'S HOW GOOD THEY??
YOU COULDN'T SAY NO.
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.
YOU GOT A LITTLE HEART
ON THAT ONE.
(Barbara)
YOU BETCHA. A HUGE HEART.
(Robert) SHE WAS GREAT.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS
A NATIONAL BRAND.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
AN INTERNATIONAL BRAND.
IT IS GOING TO BE
ON STORE SHELVES EVERYWHERE.
