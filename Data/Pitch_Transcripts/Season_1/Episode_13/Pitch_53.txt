HELLO. MY NAME IS
KIMBERLY FOLEY.
MY NAME IS MATTHEW FOLEY.
WE LIVE
IN HAWTHORNE, NEW JERSEY,
AND WE ARE THE PROUD OWNERS
AND CREATORS OF WEE CAN SHOP.
WEE CAN SHOP IS
A WHIMSICAL TOWN
WHERE CHILDREN SHOP
FOR THE ONES THEY LOVE.
LET'S GO FIND A GIFT FOR DAD.
(Kimberly) KIDS USE PINT?SIZE
SHOPPING CARTS
IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT GIFT.
WE'RE TEACHING KIDS
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS KIMBERLY,
AND THIS IS
MY BROTHER MATTHEW.
WE ARE HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU
ABOUT OUR FAMILY BUSINESS,
WEE CAN SHOP.
WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK
FOR $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 30% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
AND NOW MY SISTER WOULD LIKE
TO TELL YOU OUR STORY.
THANK YOU, MATTHEW.
"KIMBERLY AND MATTHEW CAME UP
WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA
"TO OPEN A GIFT SHOP
"WHERE CHILDREN SHOP
FOR THE ONES THEY LOVE.
"THEY CALLED THIS MAGICAL STORE
WEE CAN SHOP.
KIMBERLY,
I ADMIRE ANYBODY WHO IS
WHY ARE YOU CRYING, KIMBERLY?
KIMBERLY, LOOK,
I GET THE??THE PASSION PIECE,
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'D BE CRYING ABOUT?
THE FACT
YOU'RE NOT MAKING A PROFIT.
YOU KNOW, I?I DON'T LIKE
TO THINK THAT WAY,
BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE
IT CAN. UM...
KIMBERLY, I'M GONNA ASSUME
50% GROSS MARGINS.
YOU NEED TO DO $200,000
IN THIS STORE TO BREAK EVEN,
TO PAY YOURSELF
AND YOUR BROTHER A SALARY.
MORE, KEVIN. THEY NEED TO DO
FAR MORE THAN THAT.
AT LEAST. I'M SAYING IF YOU
JUST TOOK OUT $30,000 EACH.
IT'S A HUGE ISSUE. FROM
AN INVESTMENT POINT OF VIEW,
IT HAS NO MERIT,
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PROVEN??
BEFORE YOU BUILD
A SECOND STORE??
THE FIRST ONE MAKES MONEY.
I LOVE KIDS, BUT THEY'RE
THE HARDEST THINGS TO SELL TO
'CAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
THEIR OWN CREDIT CARDS.
ONCE WE GET THE PARENTS
IN THE STORE,
THEY'RE HAPPY TO LET
THEIR CHILDREN SPEND MONEY,
AND THEN THEY'RE PICKING UP
THINGS AS WELL.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE EVIL
THAN A BUSINESS
THAT DOESN'T CREATE A PROFIT.
AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EVIL
IS WITH EVIL.
YOU HAVE TO SHUT IT DOWN.
I'M SORRY. IT'S THE TRUTH.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
YOU STILL LEAVE
AT THE END OF A YEAR
WITH $13,000, NO SALARY.
YOU OWE YOUR RELATIVES MONEY.
I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS IS
A HOBBY THAT YOU LOVE.
BUT BY NO MEANS
IS IT A BUSINESS.
I AM DEFINITELY, UH, OUT.
KEVIN, I?I DISAGREE THAT SHE
SHOULD SHUT THE BUSINESS DOWN.
I THINK YOU'VE GROWN
THE BUSINESS, CORRECT?
100% EVERY YEAR.
YES.
SO TAKE??TAKE THE NEXT YEAR.
DON'T GO FRANCHISE THE BUSINESS.
I'D BRING MY SON THERE TO SHOP,
AND HE'D PROBABLY LOVE IT,
BUT AS AN INVESTMENT, IT??IT
WOULDN'T BE FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.
SHAME ON YOU
FOR ENCOURAGING HER.
WELL, AT THIS POINT,
YOU'RE FAILING.
BUT FAILURE, TO ME,
IS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BEGIN AGAIN MORE WISELY.
I REGRET TO SAY IT??
I'M OUT.
IT'S AN ADMIRABLE IDEA,
BUT PART OF WHAT KEVIN SAYS
IS??IS RIGHT.
ALL OF WHAT HE SAYS
IS RIGHT. 100%.
BUT...
NO, 122%.
IT'S HARD TO CALL SOMETHING
GEARED TO CHILDREN EVIL. UH??
THE <i>BUSINESS</i> IS EVIL.
BUT, REALLY,
THERE ISN'T ANY DATA
THAT SUPPORTS EXPANDING
THIS BUSINESS TODAY.
I'M OUT.
KIMBERLY, I'M YOUR ONLY FRIEND
UP HERE.
I'M THE ONLY ONE
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.
ALL THIS ENCOURAGEMENT
FOR YOU TO GO ON IS FOLLY.
IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE.
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA TELL YOU THAT.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE YOUR FAMILY.
I THINK THE ONLY MISTAKE
THAT KIMBERLY'S MAKING
IS THAT THE DATA IS TELLING HER
TO PERHAPS CHANGE DIRECTION.
IS THAT ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING,
"SHUT IT DOWN?"
AT THE VERY LEAST,
GO HOME TONIGHT,
WRITE ON A PIECE OF PAPER
THE DATE THAT YOU
HAVE TO BE PROFITABLE,
AND BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.
