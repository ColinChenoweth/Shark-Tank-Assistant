I'M ANTHONY CALVERT,
AND THIS IS MY WIFE TINA,
AND TOGETHER,
WE CREATED THE PODillow.
I'M A DEPUTY SHERIFF
FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY.
TWO YEARS AGO, I WAS INJURED
WHILE, UH, ASSIGNED
TO THE SHERIFF'S S. W. A. T. TEAM.
IT WAS DURING
MY RECOVERY PERIOD AT HOME
THAT I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
FOR THE BUSINESS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA,
AND WE DECIDED TO INVEST,
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT
EVER SINCE.
WE FOUND THAT THERE IS
A HUGE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT.
BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM NOW IS,
WE DON'T HAVE
THE AVAILABLE CAPITAL
TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND.
WE REALLY NEED THE SHARKS
AT THIS POINT,
AND IF WE DON'T GET
AN INVESTMENT,
IT COULD MEAN THAT IT WILL BE
THE END OF OUR BUSINESS,
THE END OF THE ROAD FOR US.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ANTHONY CALVERT,
AND THIS IS MY WIFE TINA.
WE'RE HERE TODAY
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR PRODUCT,
THE PODillow.
WE'RE HERE TO ASK FOR
AN INVESTMENT OF $250,000
IN RETURN FOR 33% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
THE PODillow IS A FACEDOWN
TANNING AND MASSAGE PILLOW,
AND IT HAS
INTERNAL STORAGE POCKETS
TO STORE
HIGH VALUE PERSONAL ITEMS
SUCH AS YOUR CELL PHONE,
YOUR CAR KEYS OR YOUR WALLET.
ON SOMEWHAT OF A SIDE NOTE,
I'M A 20?YEAR VETERAN
OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.
AND I'M SURE YOU CAN ONLY
IMAGINE THE RAZZING I'VE TAKEN
FROM DEVELOPING A PRODUCT
THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS. TRUST ME.
MY LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT
EASIER IF I WAS STANDING HERE
TELLING YOU ABOUT SOME COOL,
BLACK TACTICAL HOLSTER
OR THE LATEST, GREATEST THING
IN A PRISONER CONTROL DEVICE.
WHETHER YOU'RE GETTING
A MASSAGE, YOU'RE TANNING
OR YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO RELAX AT HOME,
LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH
IS TOUGH TO DO.
YOU KEEP TURNING YOUR HEAD
FROM SIDE TO SIDE
OR YOU TRY PROPPING YOUR CHIN UP
ON A ROLLED?UP BEACH TOWEL
OR YOUR FIST.
NONE OF THESE TECHNIQUES WORK,
AND YOU USUALLY JUST GIVE UP.
BY USING THE PODillow,
THERE'S A HOLE
IN THE TOP OF THE PILLOW
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO LAY
ON YOUR STOMACH FACEDOWN.
ANTHONY, DID YOU GET HURT
ON THE JOB
AND THEN HAD TO GO
FOR A MASSAGE,
AND IT CAME TO YOU ONE DAY?
LIKE, HOW DID YOU??
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE, ACTUALLY.
UM, I?I HAD SUFFERED AN INJURY.
I WAS ON MY DEPARTMENT'S
S. W. A. T. TEAM
AND I DISLOCATED MY SHOULDER.
AND AS A RESULT
OF THE SURGERY...
THIS MIGHT BE
TOO MUCH INFORMATION.
THEY...
(laughs) OKAY.
THEY??THEY HAD TO SHAVE
HALF OF MY CHEST.
OH, THAT IS TOO MUCH.
THAT IS TOO MUCH.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. YEAH.
SO I HAD TO FINISH THE JOB,
AND NOTICED THAT I WAS
EXTREMELY PALE ON THE CHEST
AND DECIDED TO GO LAY OUT.
TO LAY OUT.
AND I WENT AND LAID OUT, AND I
JUST COULD NOT GET COMFORTABLE.
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MY LIFE
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.
YOU KNOW, ONE MINUTE I'M??WHEN I
WAS ON THE S. W. A. T. TEAM,
WE'RE PLANNING
A TACTICAL ASSAULT ON A HOUSE.
AN HOUR LATER, I'M ON THE PHONE
TALKING ABOUT FLORAL PRINTS
AND DAISIES
AND WHAT COLOR PINK??
(sharks laugh)
I?I GUESS MY RESPONSE IS, YOU
KNOW, THE FACT THAT TINA AND I??
I MEAN, YOU ARE LOOKING
AT PODillow INCORPORATED??
WE??WE??WE PACKAGE THINGS
IN OUR GARAGE.
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO??NO MARKETING BUDGET.
AND YET, EVEN GIVEN
THOSE LIMITATIONS,
IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, WE'VE MOVED
6,000 OF THESE THINGS.
AND I THINK THAT
WITH THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE,
THE RESOURCES, THE KNOW?HOW,
I TRULY BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT
COULD TAKE OFF.
BUT, ANTHONY,
THAT'S POTENTIAL,
AND I APPRECIATE THAT,
BUT IT'S NOT WORTH $750,000.
IF YOU WENT TO
A VENTURE CAPITALIST COMPANY
IN THIS ECONOMY,
THEY WOULD PAY YOU A MULTIPLE
OF WHAT THE COMPANY EARNS.
SO IF YOUR COMPANY EARNED
$20,000,
MAYBE YOU'RE WORTH
$100,000 TODAY.
SO YOU'D HAVE TO SELL ME
250% OF YOUR COMPANY.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
THAT'S TOUGH MATH, RIGHT?
I SEE THE MERITS
OF THE PRODUCT,
BUT THIS DISLOCATION BETWEEN
WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE
FOR ITS VALUE
AND WHAT I COULD PAY YOU FOR IT
IS, UM, THE EARTH AND THE MOON.
I SEE.
THAT'S HOW FAR APART.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
ANTHONY,
IN MY MASS MARKET WORLD,
WE LOOK FOR THINGS
THAT CAN GO IN 50 STATES
AND YEAR?ROUND.
TO ME, IT'S A BEACHY
TYPE OF A PRODUCT,
SO THAT MEANS IT'S GONNA BE
REGIONAL AND SEASONAL.
ON THAT NOTE, I'M OUT.
UM...
I LOVE THE STORY.
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I CAN MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH
WITH THIS PRODUCT.
ANTHONY, UH,
YOU NEED A SMALL LOAN TODAY,
MAYBE $50,000,
MAYBE $100,000.
BUT HOW DO I GIVE YOU
$250,000
FOR ANY AMOUNT
OF THIS BUSINESS?
I CAN'T GET THERE.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS. GOOD LUCK.
NO PILLOW'S WORTH $750,000.
THAT'S TOO BAD.
YOU GOTTA KNOW
YOUR NUMBERS.
I THINK THAT THE SHARKS
ARE VERY CLOSE?MINDED.
THEY ARE ONLY WANTING
TO DEAL WITH HARD NUMBERS.
THEY DON'T WANT TO??
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THEY'RE
UNWILLING TO TAKE A RISK.
TO BE THAT YOU TRY
YOUR NEW MACHINE OUT,
YOU LOSE 30 POUNDS.
CACTUS, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
I'LL TAKE YOUR DEAL.
GOOD JOB.
LET'S GO MAKE SOME DOUGH.
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU GUYS.
THERE'S NOT A CHANCE IN HELL
HE'S LOSING 30 POUNDS.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU
MY SKINNY CACTUS JACK.
YEAH, LET'S SEE THAT.
