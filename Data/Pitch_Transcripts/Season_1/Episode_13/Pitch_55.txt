NATE, I WANT YOU
TO GO BACK TO YOUR CLASS
AND SAY "I WENT ON 'SHARK TANK,'
THEY BEAT ME INTO A PULP"...
(Harrington laughs)
"AND I DESERVED IT.
I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN."
I PROMISE, IF YOU PARTNER WITH
US, WE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.
WOW.
WOW.
REALLY? YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YES, I DO. WHAT DO
INVESTORS WANT, ROBERT?
THEY WANT THEIR MONEY BACK.
MY NAME'S NATE BERKOPEC.
I'M 19 YEARS OLD, ORIGINALLY
FROM EAGAN, MINNESOTA,
BUT I'M CURRENTLY A BUSINESS
STUDENT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY.
THE GOAL OF MY COMPANY,
THE FACTIONIST, IS TO BE
ETHICALLY CONSCIOUS AND MAKE
THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
MY PRODUCTS TARGET
16 TO 24 YEAR OLDS
THAT CARE ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES.
I THINK THAT MY GENERATION,
MORE THAN EVER,
WANTS TO JUST MAKE THE WORLD
A LITTLE BIT BETTER,
AND I THINK MY COMPANY
IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THAT.
AS A BUSINESS STUDENT
AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,
I THINK I'VE LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT EVALUATING AN IDEA
AND PUTTING IT INTO ACTION.
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR,
IT'S REALLY EASY TO DO
YOUR MARKET RESEARCH
IF YOU ARE THE MARKET.
SO I REALLY AM
A 19?YEAR?OLD COLLEGE STUDENT
THAT CARES ABOUT THESE ISSUES,
AND I THINK THAT MY COMPANY
AND ITS PRODUCTS REFLECT THAT.
I KNOW I HAVE THE PASSION,
THE DRIVE AND THE VISION
HI. MY NAME IS NATE BERKOPEC,
AND MY BUSINESS
IS THE FACTIONIST.
I'M LOOKING
FOR A $30,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 20% STAKE
IN THE BUSINESS.
I THINK THAT TODAY'S
YOUNG ADULTS, LIKE ME,
ARE SOME OF
THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY
AND SOCIALLY AWARE IN YEARS.
LAST YEAR WE HAD THE HIGHEST
YOUTH VOTER TURNOUT
IN OVER 30 YEARS.
I MEAN, I COULDN'T EVEN SLEEP
THE NIGHT
OF LAST FALL'S ELECTION
'CAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE
JUST RUNNING THROUGH
THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY
SHOUTING "YES, WE CAN!"
(laughs)
NOW IF WE WANT TO
CARRY THROUGH THIS MIND?SET
INTO OUR CLOTHING, WE CAN'T.
ENVIRONMENTALLY
FRIENDLY CLOTHING RIGHT NOW
IS JUST BLAND AND EXPENSIVE.
THE FACTIONIST IS AN ETHICAL
AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
APPAREL BRAND
DESIGNED BY
AND FOR MY GENERATION.
THE FACTIONIST IS CLOTHING YOU
CAN JUST FEEL GOOD ABOUT BUYING,
NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD,
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SPEND
A LOT OF MONEY,
AND IT DOESN'T HURT
THE ENVIRONMENT.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS??
THE FACTIONIST IS NOT
JUST ANOTHER APPAREL BRAND.
IT'S A MOVEMENT.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY,
NATE?
I'VE SOLD $3,000.
I JUST GOT STARTED.
IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS.
UH, I'VE BEEN SELLING BASICALLY
THROUGH COLLEGE FRIENDS.
ARE THESE YOUR PRODUCTS,
THE T?SHIRTS?
IS THAT THE BUSINESS?
IT'S T?SHIRTS.
THEY'RE ORGANIC.
UH, THE NATURAL COLORED ONES
HERE ARE MADE IN UGANDA.
UM, BUT I WANT TO EXPAND.
BUT YOU DON'T MAKE
THE T?SHIRTS.
I DON'T MAKE THE T?SHIRTS.
YOU SIMPLY SILK?SCREEN
THE LOGOS.
RIGHT. RIGHT NOW
IT'S SILK?SCREENING.
WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR A LIVING NOW?
RIGHT NOW I'M A STUDENT
AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY.
SO THERE'S NO BUSINESS TODAY.
YOU DON'T MAKE THE SHIRTS.
YOU SIMPLY SILK?SCREEN
A GOOD SAYING ONTO A T?SHIRT.
AND WHAT IS SO DIFFERENT
ABOUT YOU
THAN THE MILLION OTHER
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
STUDENTS FROM NEW YORK?
LOOK, I?I?I'M
A BUSINESS STUDENT FIRST.
SO IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS STUDENT,
YOU WOULD KNOW
THAT'S IT'S GONNA BE
VERY HARD
TO TAKE THE ENTHUSIASM??
WHICH IS ADMIRABLE...
THANK YOU.
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SAVE
THE WORLD. ME, TOO. LOVE THAT.
I WANT TO MAKE SOME MONEY
ALONG THE WAY.
(laughs) OH, GOD.
(Daymond chuckles)
THE T?SHIRT BUSINESS IS
A BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW THAT FROM
THE STREETS OF NEW YORK.
ANY GUY AND HIS DOG
CAN STAMP HIS T?SHIRT.
MARGINS ARE RAZOR THIN.
DISAGREE.
OUR MARGINS ARE OVER 50%.
BUT IT'S IRRELEVANT. I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT EVEN A BUSINESS YET.
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GONE
TO PRIVATE MANUFACTURING.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THIS
ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE?
YOU'RE GONNA ACTUALLY
HAVE TO DO BAMBOO, CORRECT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
BAMBOO??ORGANIC BAMBOO??
IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
FOR, UH, FOR??
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
BAMBOO COSTS?
IT??IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN COTTON.
NATE, YOUR GRAPHICS
ARE NOT EVEN UNIQUE.
I?I??EVEN??
YOU COULD EVEN SAY THAT.
WITH THE $30,000, I WANT
TO START GRABBING ARTISTS
FROM COUNTRIES,
LIKE, UM, MALAWI OR UGANDA,
AND SAYING "THIS IS DESIGNED
BY SOMEONE
"WHO HAS BEEN
THROUGH THIS KIND OF THING,
AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S ON??
THIS??IT'S ON THE T?SHIRT."
NATE, THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH A MOVEMENT
WHO HAVE MORE BRAND,
MORE CREDIBILITY, MORE P. R.,
MORE EVERYTHING.
(sighs) LOOK, TH??YOU CAN
SAY THAT. THERE COULD BE??
THERE'S A THOUSAND
OTHER COMPANIES OUT THERE.
THEY HAVE MILLIONS OF
MORE DOLLARS THAN ME.
WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE??
NO, NO. FORGET THE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS.
LET HIM SPEAK.
WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE IS WHAT?
BUT WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE IS
THE AUTHENTICITY, OKAY?
WHAT?
I MEAN, YOUNG??
NO, YOUNG ADULTS??
WE CAN SMELL INAUTHENTICITY
FROM A MILE AWAY.
IF SOME BIG COMPANY
COMES IN??
NATHAN, HAVE YOU EVER
WORKED FOR ANYBODY
IN A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS?
HAVE YOU EVER??
MY??MY DAD IS
AN INCREDIBLE BUSINESSMAN.
HE HAS A GARBAGE COMPANY
THAT MAKES??
HAVE YOU EVER WORKED FOR HIM?
YES, I WORK FOR HIM
RIGHT NOW.
HOW COME HE'S NOT
GIVING YOU $30,000?
HE'S A GOOD DAD. HE'S NOT
JUST GONNA GIVE HIS SON MONEY.
NO, 'CAUSE HE'S
A SMART INVESTOR.
HE'S A GOOD DAD THAT'S NOT JUST
GONNA GIVE OUT MONEY TO HIS SON.
YOU SEE, IF I WAS YOUR DAD,
IT WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR ME
TO SAY, "LOOK, NATHAN,
FIND SOMETHING ELSE
TO PUT THIS ENERGY INTO."
BUT I'M NOT YOUR DAD,
SO I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS A <i>REALLY</i> BAD IDEA.
I'M OUT.
NATE, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M 19.
(Robert) WOW.
NATHAN, I'M CURIOUS.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE YOUR BRAND
ON YOUR T?SHIRT?
I THINK THAT PEOPLE LOOK
AT THIS AND THEY SAY "WOW."
IT'S??IT'S
A CONVERSATION STARTER.
PEOPLE SEE THIS AND SAY, "WOW.
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FROM?"
I LOVE IT??
BUT GO TO HER POINT.
HOW DO I FIND IT?
I SEE THAT T?SHIRT.
I WANT TO BUY ONE.
YEAH, AND??
HOW DO I KNOW WHO IT IS?
YOU GO UP TO THE GUY, YOU SAY,
"HEY, IS THAT REALLY TRUE?"
AND YOU'RE LIKE,
"YEAH, I GOT IT FROM..."
THAT IS THE POOREST BRANDING
COMMENT I'VE EVER HEARD,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN YOU WALK BY
IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK
AND A MILLION PEOPLE PASS YOU,
THEY ARE NOT ALL GONNA ASK YOU
WHERE YOU FOUND THAT.
NATE, IF I GO TALK TO SOMEBODY
ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK,
THEY'RE GONNA SHOOT ME.
LOOK??BUT YOU GUYS ARE
SAYING THAT??I MEAN??
NATHAN, YOU'RE AT $3,000
IN SALES,
AND YOU HAVE A VALUE
OF $150,000 ON YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW, ON $3,000 IN SALES,
THERE'S NO TRACK RECORD FOR ME
TO INVEST, SO I'M??I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND I'M RISKY,
BUT IT'S A LONG?TERM INVESTMENT.
THIS IS
A SHORT?TERM INVESTMENT,
BECAUSE WE WILL LOSE
OUR MONEY IMMEDIATELY.
I AM WILLING TO WORK.
IT'S ALREADY CASH FLOW
POSITIVE. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE??
IT'S GOT $3,000 IN SALES.
(Robert) BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
PAYING YOURSELF.
(sharks laugh)
(Robert) NATE, YOU'RE LIVING
IN A FANTASY WORLD.
YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
OF PASSION,
WHICH IS THE <i>ONLY</i> REASON WHY
YOU'RE STILL STANDING THERE??
'CAUSE WE ALL ADMIRE THAT.
ONCE YOU STEP OVER
INTO THE REAL WORLD,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE REAL DATA.
AND $3,000 IN SALES
ON A T?SHIRT THAT YOU DON'T
MAKE, YOU SIMPLY SILK?SCREEN,
IS LUDICROUS.
I'M OUT.
NATE, THE??FOR ME,
THE NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP,
SO I WISH I COULD SAY I'M IN,
BUT I'M OUT.
NATHAN, I KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT T?SHIRTS,
AND TO HAVE A GRAPHIC
THAT YOU DIDN'T DESIGN,
WHICH IS VERY EASY??
I DID DESIGN ALL OF THESE.
I'M SAYING
IT'S JUST A TYPEFACE.
YOU DON'T MAKE THE PRODUCT
YOURSELF.
I'M JUST VERY AFRAID
THAT MY SHIRT WOULD SAY
"I INVESTED AND LOST 100%
OF MY MONEY IN NATHAN."
(laughs)
I'M OUT.
NATE, I WANT YOU TO GO BACK
TO YOUR CLASS,
"TO BUSINESS 101, AND SAY,
'I WENT ON 'SHARK TANK.'
THEY BEAT ME INTO A PULP"...
(laughs)
"AND I DESERVED IT.
I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN."
I DON'T THINK IT'S A MISTAKE
TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF.
OTHERWISE
I'M NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT,
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE STILL HERE.
HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING TODAY?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN HAVE
ALL THIS CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF,
DOESN'T MEAN THAT??YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN'T WALK IN WITHOUT THE SALES.
WOW. HE'S A LOT SMARTER THAN
WE GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR.
OKAY. SO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT SAYS?
PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO.
BUT IF YOU CAN'T MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE STORE
TO EARN A LIVING,
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT YOU
COULD SELL THIS AS A FRANCHISE
TO SOMEBODY ELSE?
WELL, WHEN WE STARTED OUT
THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO,
WE DID??WE FOUND A RETAIL SPACE
WE COULD AFFORD.
UM, AND WE DO THINK THAT
IN A PRIME RETAIL LOCATION,
IT COULD DO
NOTHING BUT FLOURISH.
SO OPENING A SECOND LOCATION
WOULD GIVE US THE EXPERIENCE??
WAIT A MINUTE. THE FIRST
LOCATION ISN'T MAKING MONEY YET.
SO HOW LONG
ARE YOU GOING TO LET THIS RUN
BEFORE IT MAKES A PROFIT?
GOING INTO THIS,
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY RETAIL
OR BUSINESS EXPERIENCE,
AND DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH,
WE'D ALWAYS BEEN TOLD??
ABOUT THREE TO FIVE YEARS??
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO STRUGGLE.
OKAY, YOU'RE IN YEAR FOUR
COMING UP NOW, RIGHT?
CORRECT. SO IT IS SOMETHING
WE DO THINK ABOUT.
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU PUT IN
FROM THE BEGINNING?
UM, ABOUT $120,000.
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT MONEY FROM?
UM, HELP FROM, UM, FAMILY.
FRIENDS, FAMILY, SMALL LOANS.
WHAT IS YOUR HISTORY,
AND??AND WHY DO I BELIEVE
THERE'S A PASSION YOU HAVE
IN THIS?
MY MOM AND MY SISTER
ARE BOTH TEACHERS.
I ADORE CHILDREN.
(voice breaking)
AND I HAVEN'T FOUND A...
(whispers) SORRY.
(crying) I'M NOT SURE,
'CAUSE I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.
I HAVEN'T FOUND A JOB
THAT I'VE WANTED TO DO
SINCE THE DAY THIS OPENED.
I TRULY ENJOY
THE SHOPPERS COMING IN.
I MEAN, SHE WAS
REALLY PASSIONATE.
YOU KNOW, THAT IS AN ANCHOR
ON HER LIFE. IT'S A TRAGEDY.
(Harrington)
GIVE HER ONE MORE YEAR.
WHY?
SHE MADE $13,000.
THAT WAS HER SALARY.
YOU CAN'T LIVE OFF THAT.
WELL, MAYBE <i>YOU</i> CAN'T.
SHE CAN'T EITHER. SHE'S LIVING
OFF HER FAMILY'S MONEY.
THE BUSINESS WANTS TO DIE.
SAY THAT TO
THAT INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL
STANDING THERE LOOKING AT YOU.
THAT KID HAS NO CREDIT CARD.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
(laughs)
SEEING A FAMILY'S MONEY
BEING BURNT,
AND NOBODY DEALING
WITH THE TRUTH...
BUT I'M MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT
THIS AREA AND CYCLING
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO,
YOU KNOW, BALANCE OUT
AND WORK PERFECTLY TOGETHER.
HE'S THE REAL DEAL.
MY PROBLEM WITH THIS
IS THE, UH, LACK OF
PROPRIETARY CONTENT.
UM, THE??THE ONLY THING
THAT'S UNIQUE,
AND I THINK, MR. M. B. A.,
YOU KNOW THIS,
IS THAT, UM, YOUR LOGO...
IS YOUR LOGO.
AND IT'S PROPRIETARY.
NOBODY CAN TAKE THAT AWAY.
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE
COULD BE KNOCKED OFF.
I?I LOVE THE WHOLE STORY.
I MEAN, IT'S TERRIFIC.
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES
THAT I LOOK FOR
IN AN INVESTMENT,
AND THAT'S PROPRIETARY CONTENT,
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I LOOK FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S VERY, VERY UNIQUE
AND THAT HAS
A UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION.
I JUST DON'T SEE THIS BEING
UNIQUE ENOUGH IN THE MARKET,
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
I THINK YOU'RE, UH, DID
A GREAT JOB PR?PRESENTING TODAY.
GREAT LOGO.
I THINK YOUR PRODUCT'S
A CLEVER LITTLE DEVIL.
UM... BUT I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER GOTTEN MY HANDS DIRTY...
(laughs)
AND THAT'S IN THE WAY OF ME
WARMING UP TO THIS THING.
SO I'M GOING TO... BE OUT.
WELL, THANKS, BARBARA.
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.
WELL, ROBERT? (chuckles)
WE ARE VERY, VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS.
ABSOLUTELY.
WE WANT TO CREATE
A GLOBAL WIPE EMPIRE
AND WE WANT THIS MONKEY
TO BE SEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.
LOVE THE MONKEY.
I PROMISE,
IF YOU PARTNER WITH US,
WE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.
WOW.
WOW.
I?I JUST??I'M??
I PROMISE YOU, ROBERT.
WE WILL MAKE THIS WORK.
I PROMISE.
LOOK AT THAT FACE, ROB.
COME ON.
(laughs)
