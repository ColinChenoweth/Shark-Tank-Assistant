IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,
ALL OF THE TIME.
NATE, I WANT YOU
TO GO BACK TO YOUR CLASS
TO MAKE THE FACTIONIST
A MULTIMILLION?DOLLAR COMPANY,
BUT WHAT I DON'T HAVE
IS THE CAPITAL.
THAT'S WHY I NEED
TO GET IN FRONT OF THE SHARKS.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO INVEST
IN AMERICA'S FUTURE. THANK YOU.
WOW. YOU'RE GONNA SAVE
THE WORLD?
YEAH, BUT I'M GONNA
MAKE MONEY DOING IT.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY,
NATE?
I'VE SOLD $3,000.
I JUST GOT STARTED.
IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS.
UH, I'VE BEEN SELLING BASICALLY
THROUGH COLLEGE FRIENDS.
ARE THESE YOUR PRODUCTS,
THE T?SHIRTS?
IS THAT THE BUSINESS?
IT'S T?SHIRTS.
THEY'RE ORGANIC.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,
ALL OF THE TIME.
HAVE THE GUYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE?
INITIALLY, NO. THEY GAVE ME
A PRETTY HARD TIME ABOUT IT.
BUT ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 'EM??
WE'VE SOLD JUST SHORT
OF 6,000 UNITS.
IN HOW??IN HOW LONG
A PERIOD OF TIME?
WE'RE ALMOST AT EXACTLY
OUR 2?YEAR MARK.
HOW MUCH DO
YOU SELL THEM FOR?
THEY RETAIL FOR $29.95.
THEY MADE A FAIRLY LARGE
PURCHASE IN THE SPRINGTIME.
I TOLD THEM THAT
"YOU'RE GETTING ALL I HAVE,"
TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE
AT GIFT?GIVING TIME,
"ONCE UPON A TIME,
IN FACT, WHEN THEY COME BACK
TIME AND TIME AGAIN,
NOW THEY START SAVING
THEIR OWN MONEY. EVERYONE??
SINCE THE DAY WE OPENED??
SAID, "YOU SHOULD FRANCHISE.
WE CAN SEE YOU IN EVERY MALL.
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?"
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN IN BUSINESS?
I HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH THEM.
(sniffles)
YOU HAVE GOT TO
PUT A TIMELINE ON THIS
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAMILY'S MONEY
YOU'RE BURNING,
AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
(Daymond) GOOD LUCK.
I MEAN, SHE WAS
REALLY PASSIONATE.
YOU KNOW, THAT IS AN ANCHOR
ON HER LIFE. IT'S A TRAGEDY.
(Harrington)
GIVE HER ONE MORE YEAR.
WHY?
SHE MADE $13,000.
THAT WAS HER SALARY.
YOU CAN'T LIVE OFF THAT.
WELL, MAYBE <i>YOU</i> CAN'T.
SHE CAN'T EITHER. SHE'S LIVING
OFF HER FAMILY'S MONEY.
THE BUSINESS WANTS TO DIE.
SAY THAT TO
THAT INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL
I'M TIM STANSBURY, AND THIS IS
MY BUSINESS PARTNER ERIN WHALEN.
AND MANY TIMES YOU NEED TO MAKE
ON?THE?ROAD REPAIRS
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE
100?MILE BIKE RIDES
WHEN I GOT A FLAT TIRE.
TIM CAME OVER
AND HE HELPED ME FIX IT,
(Tim) I THINK THE SHARKS
ARE GONNA LOVE US.
EVERYONE THAT WE'VE EVER TALKED
TO REALLY LIKES THE PRODUCT.
WE JUST HAVE TO GET IT
IN FRONT OF THEM.
HI, I'M TIM,
AND THIS IS ERIN,
IT WAS THEN THAT TIM AND I
DECIDED IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF THERE WAS
A PORTABLE CLEANING PRODUCT
(Tim) GREASE MONKEY WIPES
ARE INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED
DEGREASING CLEANING WIPES
THAT UTILIZE A NATURAL,
NONTOXIC CITRUS?BASED CLEANER
TIM, HOW DID YOU
FIGURE THAT OUT?
UH, WE DID A LOT
OF PRODUCT TESTING
PRIOR TO THE PRODUCT LAUNCH,
SO I CAN SMELL THE ORANGE OIL
FROM HERE.
(Tim) CORRECT.
(Barbara) IT SMELLS GOOD.
IT'S QUITE CONCENTRATED,
ISN'T IT?
(Tim) YES.
(Erin) YEP.
IF IT'S??IF IT'S
A COMMON, UM, COMMODITY,
A DERIVATIVE
OF MAKING ORANGE JUICE,
COULDN'T I MAKE UNCLE KEVIN'S
CLEANY UPPY WIPEYS?
LIKE, WHAT STOPS ME
FROM DOING THIS?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THE PORTABLE NATURE
OF THE PRODUCT IS REALLY
OUR UNIQUE, UM,
SELLING POINT.
IS THAT PATENTED?
NO, IT IS NOT PATENTED.
IS THERE ANY PATENT HERE?
NO.
WE DECIDED NOT TO PATENT IT
REALLY FOR TWO REASONS.
GIVES US SOME LEAD TIME, UM,
AND THE FACT YOU CAN BUY
ONE OR TWO AT A TIME,
THROW IT IN
YOUR GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
I LIKE THE COLOR COMBINATION
YOU HAVE THERE.
BUT IS THERE ANY TRADEMARK?
OUR LOGO IS TRADEMARKED.
(Robert) IT'S THE BEST LOGO
I'VE EVER SEEN.
(Erin and Tim) THANK YOU.
I LOVE THE BIKING SHIRT.
THANKS FOR SAYING THAT.
ACTUALLY, WE GET A GOOD RESPONSE
FROM KIDS, TOO.
ALL THIS WONDERFUL LOGO STUFF
HAS TRANSLATED
INTO WHAT IN SALES?
WE'VE ONLY HAD THE PRODUCT
ON THE MARKET FOR A FEW MONTHS,
IT'S $1 A PACKAGE?
(Erin and Tim) YES.
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S SUSTAINABLE?
WE??ACTUALLY, WE DO.
I MEAN, THERE'S 285 MILLION
REGISTERED CARS IN THE U. S.
(Barbara) TIM, I FEEL I'M BEING
FOOLED A LITTLE BIT,
NOT INTENTIONALLY SO,
BY THE LOOK YOU HAVE GOING ON.
YOU LOOK LIKE A GREASE MONKEY??
YOU KNOW, THE BEARD,
THE WHOLE LOOK??
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOUR,
UH, PRESENTATION'S
PRETTY BUTTONED?UP.
DO YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS BACKGROUND?
(laughs)
BEFORE DOING THIS
FULL?TIME, UH,
WELL, JUST IN MY CARS ALONE,
WE COULD DO??
(Tim) YEAH.
(Erin laughs)
HE OWNS MOTORCYCLES,
BOATS, CARS.
THIS IS YOUR TICKET.
OH, STOP IT, BARBARA.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.
AND, TIM, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
I JUST LOOK AT THE, UH??
