HELLO.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL SCHIAVONE.
I CALL MY IDEA CAFFEINDICATOR.
AND I'M SEEKING $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 25%
EQUITY POSITION IN THIS VENTURE.
NOW DID YOU EVER WONDER WHY
THERE'S A DECAF MARKET?
IT'S EITHER BECAUSE PEOPLE
DON'T WANT CAFFEINE
OR CAN'T HAVE CAFFEINE FOR
MEDICAL OR FOR PERSONAL REASONS.
THE FACT IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN YOUR COFFEE OR NOT.
ENTER CAFFEINDICATOR.
IT'S THE FIRST
LITMUS?LIKE TESTER
INCORPORATED
ON A SWEETENER PACKET
WHICH CHANGES COLOR
IN THE PRESENCE OF CAFFEINE.
IS IT INK IN THE PAPER
OR IN THE SUGAR?
IT'S ON THE PAPER.
IT'S AN INK.
IT'S MICROENCAPSULATED
IN GELATIN.
(Robert) BUT, MICHAEL,
DOES IT REALLY WORK?
OH, CERTAINLY IT DOES WORK.
ABSOLUTELY.
LET ME DEMONSTRATE
A MOCK PROTOTYPE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, IF THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN THE COFFEE,
IT WILL TURN PINK.
IT'S DYNAMIC. IT'S CURIOUS.
IT'S FUN TO SHARE.
AND HEY, I DON'T EVEN USE
A SWEETENER IN MY COFFEE,
BUT I JUST USED A PACKET.
THE SWEETENER PACKET MARKET IS
ROUGHLY A $12?BILLION MARKET,
OF WHICH, THE BLUE GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE PINK GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE GREEN GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE YELLOW GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
AND THE WHITE GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE.
NOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF
ANY ONE OF THESE MANUFACTURERS
WERE ABLE TO DRAMATICALLY
INCREASE THEIR SHARE
IN THIS GLOBAL MARKET?
DOES THAT HAVE VALUE?
YES.
OF COURSE IT DOES.
SHARKS, WELCOME TO
THE SUGAR BOWL BRAWL.
THESE GUYS ARE ALL FIGHTING
FOR MARKET SHARE.
SO WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO TAKE A $500?MILLION PRODUCT
TO A $1?BILLION PRODUCT?
BUT IS THERE AN INDICATION
OF IT HEAVILY CAFFEINATED
OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS?
NO, IT DOESN'T TELL ME
HOW MUCH CAFFEINE.
IT TELLS ME WHETHER OR NOT
THERE IS CAFFEINE.
ALMOST LIKE A PREGNANCY TEST??
VERY SIMILAR. IN FACT,
THAT WAS PART OF THE??
BUT DOESN'T??DOESN'T DECAF??
HAS ABOUT 2 MILLIGRAMS
OF CAFFEINE IN IT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
VERSUS 120 MILLIGRAMS.
BUT IT'S STILL
GONNA TRIGGER THE TEST.
I CAN MASK OUT
THE FALSE POSITIVES.
(Robert) YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT OF THIS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
THE PERSON WANTS TO KNOW
WHETHER THERE'S CAFFEINE OR NOT.
IT'S THE FACT THAT THE WHITE GUY
CAN SAY TO THE YELLOW GUY,
"MY PACKET'S BETTER
BECAUSE IT DOES THIS."
I GET IT. I GET THAT.
(O'Leary) AND I AGREE WITH YOU.
THAT'S IT!
(Michael) THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
THE MANUFACTURING
AND THE DISTRIBUTION
IS ALREADY IN PLACE.
WHAT WE'RE LEVERAGING IS MARKET
SHARE IN A GLOBAL INDUSTRY.
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN PARTNERING WITH ME
ON THIS VENTURE.
SO, MICHAEL, WHEN YOU WENT
TO THE BLUE GUYS,
AND SAID,
"I HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA,
BUY MY PRODUCT,"
WHAT DID THEY SAY?
I HAVE NOT GONE
TO THE BLUE GUYS YET.
WHY NOT?
I CAME TO YOU GUYS TO SEE
IF YOU CAN OPEN THE DOORS
AND PARTNER WITH ME IN??
ON THIS.
YOU'VE NEVER TRIED TO TALK TO
ANY OF THE WHITE, YELLOW,
GREEN, PINK, BLUE GUYS?
NO, SIR. I HAVE NOT.
AND DO YOU OWN THE PATENT??
I DO.
HOW MUCH WILL THIS ADD
TO THE COST OF EACH PACKET?
IT HAS TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.
(Robert) YOU DON'T KNOW
THE NUMBER?
UH, UH, NO. THE FACT
OF THE MATTER
IS THAT ANYTHING YOU MAKE
IN MASS QUANTITY,
THE??THE??THE??THE PRICE
OF IT DROPS.
WHAT'S YOUR COST
TO MAKE ONE PACK NOW?
I DON'T HAVE A COST TO MAKE
ONE PACK RIGHT NOW.
WHAT??GIVE US A NUMBER. WE JUST
WANT A FEEL FOR THE NUMBER.
(Robert) VOLUME??YEAH.
HERE'S MY THOUGHT ON THAT.
UM, IF I INCREASE
MARKET SHARE DRAMATICALLY,
THE COST OF PRODUCTION
GOES DOWN, PROFIT GOES UP.
(Barbara) YES.
GIVE US A NUMBER.
YEAH, WE??WE GET THAT,
BUT CAN IT BE MADE
FOR A FRACTION OF PENNIES MORE?
ABSOLUTELY.
IT CAN?
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, MICHAEL,
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, BASICALLY,
IS YOU DEFINED
YOUR ENTIRE MARKET.
THAT'S GOOD. IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.
THE BAD IS, IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.
IF ONE OF THESE COLOR
DON'T BUY YOUR PRODUCT,
THERE IS NO MARKET.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
THAT'S CORRECT.
BUT WAIT A MINUTE. YOUR STRATEGY
IS TO GO TO ALL FIVE AND SAY,
"WHICH ONE OF YOU WANTS TO
INCREASE YOUR MARKET SHARE?"
SO THE REAL QUESTION
ON YOUR DEAL IS,
IF I'M ONE OF THESE
MARKETEER MANUFACTURERS,
I HAVE TO BUY INTO YOUR PREMISE
THAT PUTTING AN INDICATOR
FOR CAFFEINE
IS GOING TO
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
MICHAEL REALIZES,
HIS 25% IS LUDICROUS.
(O'Leary) THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A NEGOTIATION, ROBERT.
THAT'S LIKE BASICALLY SAYING
THAT YOU'LL DO THIS DEAL,
BUT YOU WANT MORE THAN 25%,
AND YOUR GREED IS SHOWING.
THAT SHOULD BE
FAMILIAR TO YOU.
I SAW YOUR GREED.
I SAW YOUR GREED.
YOU KNOW, MIKE, I WAS
ON THE FENCE FOR A SECOND,
BUT I AGREE WITH BARBARA
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO
VERY POINTED
AND SPECIFIC MARKETING.
I LIKE THE IDEA
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTACK
THE NUMBER ONE DRUG
SOLD IN THE WORLD.
BUT I AM OUT.
MICHAEL, I'LL PAY FOR AN OPTION
TO SEE IF ONE
OF THE FIVE GUYS DO IT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
FOR...
60%...
CONTINGENT ON GETTING A DEAL
WITH ONE OF THE FIVE COMPANIES.
MICHAEL, I HAVE
A BETTER OFFER.
MICHAEL, I HAVE
A BETTER OFFER.
SAME CONTINGENCY,
BUT I'LL??I'LL MAKE YOU
THE OFFER AT 50%.
ALL THE OFFERS ARE CONTINGENT.
IT'S WORTHLESS
IF THEY DON'T WANT IT.
BUT WE ALL AGREED ON THAT.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS,
OKAY?
NOW I'M DECIDING WHETHER
TO TRUMP BOTH OF YOU BOZOS.
NOW WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
MICHAEL, YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
I NEED AN ANSWER. I'M GONNA
TAKE MY OFFER OFF THE TABLE.
I NEED AN ANSWER ON MY OFFER.
OH.
UM...
I BELIEVE THAT I WOULD TAKE
THE 50% PARTNERSHIP.
ARE YOU ACCEPTING MY OFFER
THEN, MICHAEL?
I'LL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. GOOD JOB.
(Barbara) NICE JOB.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NICE TO BE PARTNERS.
