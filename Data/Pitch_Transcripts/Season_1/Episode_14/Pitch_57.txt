MY NAME IS JILL QUILLIN.
I'M FROM KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE.
AND MY PRODUCT ENHANCES
A PRODUCT THAT MOST WOMEN LOVE
AND USE EVERY DAY.
(laughs)
NOT ONLY IS MY PRODUCT UNIQUE
AND USEFUL,
BUT IT ALSO HELPS WOMEN
SAVE MONEY.
THAT LOOKS GOOD.
MY NAME IS JILL
WITH DIVINE INNOVATIONS,
MANUFACTURER OF THE HOT NEW ITEM
FOR WOMEN WHO WEAR LIPSTICK??
THE LIPSTIX REMIX.
I WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER YOU TODAY
30% EQUITY STAKE
IN THE COMPANY
IN EXCHANGE FOR $105,000.
THIS IS LIPSTIX REMIX.
IT'S A ONE?OF?A?KIND SYSTEM.
IT'S NOT AVAILABLE
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE MARKET.
IT INCLUDES THIS LIPSTICK MOLD,
WHICH IS THE SECRET WEAPON
TO CREATING
BEAUTIFUL LIPSTICKS AT HOME
IN A FEW MINUTES
IN YOUR KITCHEN.
THE REASON WHY I NEEDED
THIS PRODUCT SO BADLY IS BECAUSE
I HAD PERSONALLY
OVER $250 WORTH OF LIPSTICK
THAT I COULDN'T WEAR.
I GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
OF THAT TUBE,
THERE'S ONE?THIRD OF MY LIPSTICK
THAT DOESN'T TWIST UP.
MANY WOMEN ARE WASTING THAT.
NOW WITH LIPSTIX REMIX, I COULD
TAKE A COUPLE OF THOSE COLORS,
MIX THEM TOGETHER
AND CREATE A BEAUTIFUL SHADE
THAT I LOVE.
JILL, HOW DOES IT WORK?
LET ME SHOW YOU REAL QUICK.
YOU TAKE THE COLORS
YOU WANT TO MIX TOGETHER.
JUST PUT THEM
IN YOUR MEASURING CUP.
NOW YOU PUT THIS IN
THE MICROWAVE FOR 45 SECONDS.
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
WITH THIS, OKAY?
YOU TAKE YOUR LIPSTICK MOLD.
IT'S REALLY EASY.
YOU JUST FILL IT UP
TO THE TOP THERE.
AND THAT GOES INTO THE FREEZER
FOR TEN MINUTES.
NOW I DO HAVE ONE THAT'S ALREADY
READY HERE FOR US.
THIS IS
THE REALLY EXCITING PART.
OKAY, YOU JUST POP OFF THE TOP.
OKAY?
SO ALL YOU DO IS
YOU TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN,
AND YOU'RE READY TO PULL IT
OUT OF THE TUBE.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT TWISTS UP AND DOWN
AND LOOKS LIKE
A BRAND?NEW TUBE OF LIP SHADE.
(Barbara) AND IT DOESN'T
FALL OUT?
NO.
SO WOULD I BE ABLE TO TELL
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
NEW LIPSTICK
AND NUKED LIPSTICK?
WELL, IN FACT,
YOU WOULD NOT.
THE MAJOR MANUFACTURERS HEAT
AND REHEAT THEIR LIPSTICK
JILL, I'M A GUY.
I DON'T OFTEN WEAR LIPSTICK.
(Jill laughs)
BARBARA, IS THIS
A GOOD IDEA OR NOT?
IT'S SO CLEVER.
AND NOT ONLY
FOR THE REASONS YOU SAY,
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
NOTHING'S MORE EXCITING
THAN A NEW LIPSTICK.
EXACTLY.
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT NOW?
WE HAVE SOLD
ALMOST 800 UNITS
IN A VERY, VERY SMALL
LOCAL MARKET.
HOW?
I SET UP A TABLE IN THE MALL
FOR TEN DAYS AT CHRISTMAS.
WE SOLD 254 UNITS.
A LITTLE OVER 6 GRAND.
HOW MUCH DO ONE
OF THESE THINGS SELL FOR?
THIS IS $19.95.
(Robert) JILL,
AGREE WITH ME ON THIS??
IF YOU DON'T GET THIS ON
A TV SHOPPING CHANNEL
TYPE OF FORMAT,
IT'S NEVER GONNA SELL.
THIS IS PURELY A ONE?DIMENSIONAL
GO?TO?MARKET STRATEGY.
THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK RETAIL.
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK WHOLESALE.
IT CAN ONLY BE SOLD THROUGH,
UH, HARRINGTON'S FORMAT.
AND I HAVE NO ACCESS TO THAT.
I'M OUT. I'M OUT
BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP YOU.
YOU KNOW,
I MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU,
BECAUSE THERE ARE
A LOT OF PRODUCTS
ON RETAIL SHELVES RIGHT NOW
THAT STARTED OUT
IN DIRECT RESPONSE.
IN FACT,
I'M NOT BEING UNREALISTIC.
I UNDERSTAND THAT $105,000
IS GONNA GET US A GOOD TEST.
WE'RE GONNA DO A TEST
IN A SMALL, LOCAL MARKET.
AND WHEN WE HAVE
INCREASED OUR AWARENESS,
THEN WE GO TO
THE NUMBER ONE TV RETAILER,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE GET 90 MILLION MORE HOMES.
THEN WE GO AND WE PUT THEM
ON THE SHELVES
BECAUSE WOMEN KNOW
LIPSTIX REMIX.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
THIS WILL SELL,
AND WE WILL SELL SEVEN
FOR EVERY ONE WE SELL ON TV.
(sighs) BOY.
PRESENTATION'S GREAT.
YOU'RE GREAT.
YOU'RE A TERRIFIC SALESMAN.
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
BUT I'M VERY FRUSTRATED
BECAUSE THIS IS
ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS
WHERE I ACTUALLY...
I'VE GOT A LITTLE GUY
ON ONE SHOULDER SAYING,
"DO IT. IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
AND SCREW UP HARRINGTON
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT."
THE OTHER SIDE SAYS,
"YOU'RE NOT A LIPSTICK GUY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
SO I'M GONNA LISTEN TO MY "I'M
NOT A LIPSTICK GUY" ON THIS ONE,
AND SAY, I'M OUT,
BUT WITH HUGE RESERVATIONS.
I THINK YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO PUT IN $105,000.
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU HALF THE CASH.
OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HUSTLE
ONE OF THE OTHER SHARKS
TO GET THE REST.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $105,000
FOR...
(Daymond) 40%.
SO DO WE HAVE
GOOD NEWS, JILL?
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(Harrington) JILL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
GREAT, THANKS. GOOD LUCK.
(Daymond) BARB, IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR ME TO GET A HUG?
UGH!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT ME 10% MORE.
WOW.
DAYMOND, YOU SAVAGE ANIMAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
YOU'RE SO CLEVER,
I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT
BEING INSULTED. IT'S GREAT.
SO NOW I HAVE THE DREAM TEAM.
I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS
THOUGHT THAT I WOULD HAVE
SUCH A GREAT PACKAGE.
AND I CANNOT WAIT TO TAKE
THIS PRODUCT TO MARKET.
I HAVE THE POWER TO DO THIS DEAL
AND MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
IT WOULD BE BEST TO WORK
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.
SO THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU RICH.
THANK YOU.
