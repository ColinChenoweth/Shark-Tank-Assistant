IT WILL MAKE MONEY.
ANNIE, YOU'VE GOTTA WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE MONEY.
THERE ISN'T ANY.
YOU NEVER EVEN GAVE
AN OFFER, DID YOU?
HE'S JUST MOUTHING OFF.
DAYMOND, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE LEARNED?
TALK IS CHEAP,
AND SO IS KEVIN O'LEARY.
(sharks laugh)
BEING IN ON IT?
AND WHY DO WE NEED BARBARA?
WHOA. NO.
SHAFT?O?RENO TO YOU, HONEY.
HI, MY NAME IS JEFF HUGHES.
AND I'M ANNIE HUGHES.
AND OUR COMPANY
IS LEGAL GRIND,
AND WE ARE SEEKING $200,000.
AND IN EXCHANGE,
WE WILL GIVE YOU
15% EQUITY IN OUR BUSINESS.
MM. THAT MUST MEAN
THERE'S PROFIT.
OH, YEAH.
17 YEARS AGO, I GRADUATED
FROM LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL
IN LOS ANGELES
AND PASSED THE BAR EXAM.
THE ECONOMY WAS IN RECESSION,
AND THERE WERE NOT
A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES
FOR YOUNG LAWYERS.
I DECIDED
TO PURSUE OTHER INTERESTS.
I ALWAYS WANTED TO OPEN UP
A COFFEEHOUSE.
(Jeff)
IT'S A PLACE WHERE ANYBODY
CAN CONVENIENTLY ACCESS
AFFORDABLE LEGAL INFORMATION,
SERVICES AND REPRESENTATION.
(whispers) WITH YOUR FUNDING.
WITH YOUR FUNDING
AND EXPERTISE,
WE WILL FRANCHISE
LEGAL GRIND LOCATIONS.
(Annie) SO FOR THE SAKE
OF JUSTICE,
WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE
FUND US.
JEFF AND ANNIE,
WHATEVER HAPPENS HERE TODAY,
I WANT YOU BOTH TO KNOW THIS??
YOU HAVE A FUTURE
IN BAD THEATER.
(laughs)
THANKS.
ANNIE, DO WE GET A COFFEE?
OH, YEAH.
CAN YOU SERVE HIM ONE?
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'D BE ANY GOOD.
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SELL
ANY LEGAL SERVICES YET.
THIS IS A CONCEPT.
NO. JEFF STARTED THIS
IN 1996 IN SANTA MONICA.
(Robert) YOU'VE HAD THIS FOR?
13 YEARS.
SO ARE YOU MAKING ANY MONEY?
UH, WE'RE GROSSING
ABOUT $200,000 A YEAR.
ARE YOU NETTING ANY MONEY?
UM, I THINK... YOU KNOW,
$20,000, $30,000 A YEAR.
MOST??MOST OF THE INCOME
GO TO OUR SALARIES,
'CAUSE WE'VE HAD TO RAISE
A FAMILY.
WELL, HOW MUCH
DO YOU TAKE IN SALARY
BEFORE THAT LEFTOVER MONEY
FOR PROFIT IS THERE?
UH, MAYBE $50,000.
EACH?
SO, JEFF AND ANNIE,
JUST SO I'M VERY CLEAR...
OKAY.
YOU'VE COMBINED A COFFEE SHOP
WITH LEGAL SERVICES.
YES, TO SERVE
THE MIDDLE CLASS, BECAUSE??
TELL 'EM. I MEAN, THERE'S??
THE MIDDLE CLASS IS...
NOT GETTING
THEIR LEGAL SERVICES MET.
I GET THE IDEA.
I LIKE THE TARGET MARKET.
OKAY.
BUT YOU'RE LOSING ME ON THE FACT
THAT TO GET INTO YOUR BUSINESS,
I HAVE TO GO INTO
THE RETAIL COFFEE BUSINESS.
NO, YOU DON'T.
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A COFFEEHOUSE SETTING.
IT'S JUST A PLACE TO START,
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR LAWYERS
HAVE THEIR OWN OFFICES
AND EVERYTHING.
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU WOULD BE COMING THERE
FOR ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THAT LAWYER.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY YOU WANT TO BE
IN THE LOW?MARGIN
LEGAL SERVICES BUSINESS
AND COFFEE HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT?
WELL, I?I DON'T THINK
IT MIGHT BE LOW MARGIN. UH??
I'M LOOKING AT THESE PRICES.
HELPS US, TOO, WITH UPSELLING.
OKAY, ANNIE,
WALK ME THROUGH ONE.
I'LL TAKE HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE
FOR $100.
OKAY.
SO DO WE HAVE TO FIND
LOTS MORE JEFF AND ANNIES
THAT WANT TO WORK?
NO, WE DON'T.
WELL, YOU SAID YOU'RE
FRANCHISING THEM, RIGHT?
I KNOW, BUT IT'S US??
IT'S TRAINING
THE RIGHT PERSON.
BUT, JEFF,
YOU'RE AN ACCREDITED LAWYER.
IS THERE ANY LAWS
ABOUT HAVING COFFEE WAITRESSES
PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES?
(laughs)
NO, AS LONG AS SHE'S NOT
PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE.
SHE'S A DOCUMENT ASSISTANT.
ISN'T THIS MUCH BETTER DONE
ON THE INTERNET
WHERE THERE'S NO
BRICK?AND?MORTAR COST INVOLVED?
WHY THE COFFEE SHOP?
THEY WANT TO INTERACT.
ANNIE, CRAZY IDEA.
JUST OPEN UP A STORE
THAT SAYS "LEGAL SERVICES."
RIGHT.
NOBODY WOULD COME IN 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T TRUST LAWYERS.
(laughs)
THERE'S TRUTH IN THAT.
WHAT IF YOU'RE JUST SITTING
IN A COFFEE SHOP
TALKING TO A LAWYER?
IT'S BRINGING
SOMEBODY TOGETHER??
PEOPLE GO
TO OTHER PLACES AND SIT
AND MEET WITH THEIR LAWYER.
(O'Leary) ALL RIGHT.
THE COFFEE HAS TO DO WITH
JUST MAKING SOMEBODY
FEEL COMFORTABLE...
YES.
ADDRESSING THEIR DIFFICULT
LEGAL ISSUES.
BUT WHY IS IT??
WHY IS IT COFFEE AND LAWYERS?
WHY ISN'T IT PIZZA AND LAWYERS?
WHY ISN'T IT
DRY CLEANER AND LAWYERS?
WHERE'S THE DIGNITY
IN PIZZA AND LAWYERS?
WHAT, THERE'S DIGNITY IN COFFEE?
CAN I SHOW YOU A LIST
OF FRANCHISEE REQUESTS
THAT WE'VE RECEIVED?
YOU HAVE A LIST
OF FRANCHISEE REQUESTS?
OH, OVER A HUNDRED.
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE DOWN PAYMENTS
ON THE FRANCHISEE REQUESTS?
THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE 20 FRANCHISEE REQUESTS
WORTH $10,000 APIECE.
RIGHT.
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE POSITION TO KNOW
HOW OR WHAT TO DO
WHEN WE GET THESE REQUESTS.
YEAH, BUT THEN
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ONCE WE GIVE YOU THE $200,000?
YOU'RE STILL NOT GONNA KNOW.
WELL, YOU HIRE??
YES.
YOU HIRE LEGAL CONSULTANTS.
(Harrington) HMM.
NOT LEGAL??
FR?FRANCHISE CONSULTANTS.
(laughs)
(laughs) YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO THE COFFEE SHOP.
DO YOU SEE THE IRONY?
DO YOU SEE THE IRONY THERE?
YOU'RE GONNA
JUMP OVER THE COUNTER
AND SIT WITH A LAWYER.
LET'S SAY I SAY, "LOOK,
I WANT TO BE IN THE COFFEE
AND LEGAL SERVICES BUSINESS."
THEN I'D ASK THIS QUESTION??
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES
YOUR COFFEE/LEGAL STORE MAKE?
AND THAT ANSWER IS ZERO.
NO. IT MAKES MONEY.
NO, IT DOESN'T.
YES, IT DOES.
AFTER YOU PAY YOURSELVES
A NORMAL SALARY,
THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE.
ANNIE, YOU'VE GOTTA WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE MONEY.
THERE ISN'T ANY.
HOW AM I GONNA PAY A FRANCHISE
FEE TO YOU IF I'M NOT PROFITING?
WELL, OKAY.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF MONEY IN MARKETING.
JEFF, ANSWER THIS FOR ME.
LET'S SAY I TAKE MY HARD?EARNED
200,000 BUCKS
AND HAND IT TO YOU TODAY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT MONEY?
WELL, I THINK, BARBARA,
YOU AND I
WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS IT.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN
AS TO HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE USE OF THAT MONEY?
WE TAKE $115,000
AND OPEN UP
A PROTOTYPE STORE.
THAT STORE SHOULD BE MAKING
$300,000.
AND FIND ANOTHER
LITTLE ANNIE THERE
TO SIT AND SERVE THE COFFEE,
TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY.
A LEGAL DOCUMENT ASSISTANT,
SO THE??
ANNIE, YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
YES, WE DO.
YOU BARELY GET BY TODAY.
IF YOU ADD MARKETING COSTS...
BECAUSE WE DON'T ADVERTISE
AND WE DON'T MARKET.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
ANY MONEY.
EVERY MONEY THAT WE MAKE,
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE TO TURN??
(Barbara)
YOU'VE NEVER ADVERTISED?
(Jeff) IF WE WORK PROPERLY??
ANNIE, ANNIE, ANNIE, GUYS,
I THINK YOU'VE HAD
A LITTLE BIT
TOO MUCH COFFEE TODAY.
(laughs)
YOU HAVE TO JUST CALM DOWN
AND LISTEN TO US.
ANNIE, YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
YES, WE DO.
YOU BARELY GET BY TODAY.
WE MAKE MORE??
ANNIE, ANNIE, ANNIE, GUYS,
I THINK YOU'VE HAD
A LITTLE BIT
TOO MUCH COFFEE TODAY.
(laughs)
YOU HAVE TO JUST CALM DOWN
AND LISTEN TO US.
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF,
UH, NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON??
IT IS OUR MONEY.
YEAH.
I KNOW.
THAT'S IT.
RIGHT.
BUT YOU'RE NOT HAVING
AN OPEN MIND.
GUYS, I'M GONNA JUST SAY
WHERE I STAND ON THIS.
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
OF GETTING INTO A BUSINESS
WITH A BUNCH OF LAWYERS.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY,
I'M OUT.
JEFF AND ANNIE, THE ONLY THING
I SAW OF VALUE HERE TODAY
WAS SOME REALLY BAD THEATER.
BUT I DON'T SEE A BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "BAD THEATER"?
IT WAS FUNNY.
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
OKAY??
WELL, WHY IS THAT BAD?
IT'S NOT BAD.
I SAID IT WAS VALUABLE.
YOU SAID IT WAS BAD.
IT WAS FUNNY.
IT'S NOT FUNNY TO THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HELP.
I THINK WE'RE ALL??I THINK
WE'RE ALL OUT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.
I LIKE ANNIE??
ANNIE GET YOUR GUN.
SHE WAS READY TO FIGHT.
KEVIN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PISSING HER OFF
WITH THE BAD THEATER THING.
(Daymond) SHE WAS MAD.
SHE WAS MAD AS HELL.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA
COME AFTER YOU.
SHE MIGHT,
BUT I'M STILL RIGHT.
THEY'RE NOT OPEN?MINDED
TO NEW IDEAS FOR, LIKE,
MAYBE THIS GENERATION, OKAY?
AND WE'RE IN A RECESSION.
YOU DON'T THINK PEOPLE
ARE GONNA BE, LIKE,
LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT WAYS
TO SPEND THEIR MONEY
ON LEGAL SERVICES?
