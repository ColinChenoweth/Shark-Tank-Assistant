WE'RE IN TOUGH TIMES.
I MEAN, AS A WIFE AND A MOM,
I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
FOR WOMEN TO FIND WAYS
TO SAVE MONEY.
THIS IS CHEAPER.
I BEGAN MY BUSINESS
RIGHT AT MY KITCHEN TABLE.
I STARTED THIS COMPANY SO THAT
I COULD WORK FROM HOME
AND BE WITH MY CHILDREN MORE.
ISN'T THIS FUN?
THE BIGGEST HURDLE
THAT I HAVE RUN INTO
IS THAT THIS IS
A FEMALE?TARGETED PRODUCT.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF MEN
ARE THE ONES WITH THE MONEY,
AND THEY JUST DON'T GET IT.
THERE'S NO AWARENESS
OF THIS PRODUCT.
I NEED THE SHARKS
TO INCREASE AWARENESS
AND TO TAKE THIS PRODUCT
TO MARKET SUCCESSFULLY.
NOW IS THE TIME
TO TAKE LIPSTIX REMIX
AND THREE TUBES
OF YOUR FAVORITE COLOR
AND THAT'S ENOUGH LIPSTICK
TO MAKE A BRAND?NEW TUBE
FOR FREE.
ALL THE TIME.
HI, I'M TIM GAVERN.
MY MISSION IS TO BRING HAPPINESS
TO KIDS EVERYWHERE.
(clicks button, starts engine)
I'M CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.
AND MY ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE
A CAPTAIN ICE CREAM FRANCHISE
IN EVERY LITTLE TOWN
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.
(children)
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN ICE CREAM!
MY NAME IS TIM GAVERN.
I'M CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.
IN EXCHANGE FOR $48,000,
I'M OFFERING A 25% PARTNERSHIP
IN THE CAPTAIN ICE CREAM
EXPERIENCE.
CAPTAIN ICE CREAM IS A MOBILE
NOVELTY ICE CREAM VENDING
BUSINESS.
CAPTAIN ICE CREAM WILL BE
A FRANCHISE
OF MY UNIQUE ICE CREAM MOPEDS
AND WILL ALSO BECOME
THE NEXT BIG
NOVELTY ICE CREAM BRAND.
CAPTAIN ICE CREAM FRANCHISEES
WILL PROJECT A POSITIVE,
WHOLESOME IMAGE
BY RIDING
MY UNIQUE ICE CREAM MOPEDS
WEARING TRADITIONAL WHITE
CAPTAIN ICE CREAM UNIFORMS
AND PAPER ICE CREAM HATS.
DO YOU OWN A NATIONAL TRADEMARK
FOR THE CAPTAIN ICE CREAM??
YES, I OWN THE TRADEMARK.
IF YOU HAVE
THE NATIONAL TRADEMARK,
THAT MEANS NOBODY ELSE CAN CALL
THEMSELVES CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ICE CREAM
TO GIVE US?
OF COURSE.
(Robert) CAN I HAVE SOME?
SURE. WOULD YOU ALL LIKE SOME?
(Daymond) YOU SHOULDA DONE THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER ONE SELLING PRODUCT.
TIM, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
DID YOU MAKE THIS ICE CREAM?
NO. THIS IS BOUGHT
FROM A COMPANY.
BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
MY NUMBER ONE PRODUCT.
IT'S DELICIOUS.
CAPTAIN, WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE THE, UM,
CAPTAIN ICE CREAM MOPED?
A BRAND?NEW VERSION OF THIS
WILL COST ABOUT $7,000.
SO WHAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL?
HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL
IN A DAY, CAPTAIN?
UM, GENERALLY ABOUT $200 WORTH
OF ICE CREAM IN??IN 4 HOURS.
OH...
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.
$200 A DAY?
(Barbara) FOUR HOURS.
IN??IN FOUR HOURS.
GENERALLY AN EVENT IS??
IS FOUR HOURS.
WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?
IT'S EASY TO MAKE
$25 PER HOUR AS A VENDOR.
BUT WHAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL
FOR ME AS AN INVESTOR?
YOU WANT $48,000 FOR WHAT?
I WANT TO BUILD
A COUPLE OF MOPEDS.
I WANT TO START WORKING ON
AN ELECTRIC VERSION OF THIS.
OKAY?
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE NOW?
HOW MANY MOPEDS?
THIS IS IT.
JUST THE ONE?
AND ARE YOU MAKING A LIVING?
I'M??I'M BARELY
EKING OUT A LIVING.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL IT
TO OTHER FRANCHISEES,
AND YOU'RE BARELY MAKING
A LIVING?
I DON'T, BECAUSE I'M STILL
LEARNING THE BUSINESS.
OKAY, YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA
FRANCHISE THIS.
HAVE YOU HIRED
ANY FRANCHISE LAWYERS?
(laughs)
DO YOU HAVE DOCUMENTS PREPARED?
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
KEVIN, HE'S MAKING $25
AN HOUR SELLING ICE CREAM.
(Harrington) RIGHT.
RIGHT NOW I'M SELLING...
A CONCEPT.
SEVERAL DIFFERENT BRANDS??
YOU'RE REALLY SELLING A CONCEPT
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
YES. IF I BUY
A FRANCHISE FROM YOU,
LET ME WALK IN THAT GUY'S SHOES.
OKAY.
HOW MUCH COULD I REASONABLY
EXPECT TO EARN IF I WAS WORKING
FOUR HOURS A DAY,
FIVE DAYS A WEEK?
BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUMBER
YOU THREW OUT, FOUR HOURS??
MORE THAN YOU'RE MAKING
IN REAL ESTATE TODAY.
(Barbara) PROBABLY. (laughs)
(laughs)
YOU COULD EASILY MAKE $25,000
TO $50,000 A YEAR
AS AN ICE CREAM PERSON.
I GET WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU SELL ICE CREAM.
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IS,
BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN MAKE
A MOPED WITH A FREEZER ON IT.
YEAH, BUT CAN THEY?
THAT'S THE THING.
CAN THEY? YOU KNOW??
YEAH, THEY CAN.
(Daymond)
TIM, I THINK IT'S A?A CRIME
FOR ME TO INSULT
AN ICE CREAM MAN.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
JUST INNOCENT AND BEAUTIFUL
ABOUT AN ICE CREAM MAN.
I CAN APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.
BUT THE BUSINESS
IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR ME.
BUT I DO LOVE YOUR, UH,
YOUR??YOUR ATTITUDE
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
BUT I'M OUT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, BEC??
ALL RIGHT, THINK ABOUT IT.
OKAY, IT'S A VERY INEXPENSIVE
FRANCHISE??
WELL, THINK ABOUT
MY POINT OF VIEW.
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS,
HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
WELL, YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK
IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.
HOW?
FIRST OF ALL,
SAY THE FRANCHISE IS $12,500
TO BE A FRANCHISEE
OF CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.
OKAY, SO??
WHY WOULD ANYBODY GIVE YOU
$12,000 WHEN THEY COULD JUST??
WHY NOT? YOU'RE GONNA SELL THEM
ICE CREAM AT A DISCOUNT
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT A CONCEPT
OF WHICH NOTHING IS...
UNIQUE AND PATENTABLE OR??
YOU DON'T THINK
THIS IS UNIQUE?
ADMIT IT. IT'S UNIQUE.
AT LEAST GIVE THE GUY THAT.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE DECIDED?
I'M GONNA GIVE??
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $48,000
OF BARBARA'S MONEY.
(laughs)
(laughs)
YOU KNOW,
I??I'M HOLDING MYSELF BACK,
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN CHILDREN
AND WONDERFUL, WARM AND??
AND THINGS FROM THE PAST.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO RECREATE HERE.
BUT??BUT I CAN'T MAKE
ANY MONEY.
AND I WANT YOU
TO GET BACK ON THAT THING
AND RIDE INTO THE SUNSET,
BECAUSE??
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE, THOUGH,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A FRANCHISE FEE...
NO, I REALLY DO BECAUSE,
I HAVE TO??HERE'S THE PROBLEM??
AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A PROFIT
ON EVERY BIKE.
HERE'S THE BUSINESS REALITY
IN THIS.
OKAY.
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SEND YOU AN INVOICE
FOR ABOUT $2,000 FOR MY TIME.
(laughs)
I GONNA TAKE OFF 50 CENTS
FOR THE ICE CREAM, THOUGH.
OKAY. IT'S $1.50, BY THE WAY.
$1.50? THAT'S AN OUTRAGE.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S A 400% MARKUP
ON ICE CREAM.
THERE'S JUST NOTHING HERE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
(Daymond) SAY THE WORD.
I'M OUT.
I WANT TO SUMMARIZE
WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME,
JUST SO I'M CLEAR.
OKAY, SURE.
YOU BARELY MAKE ANY MONEY
DOING THIS TODAY.
YOU DON'T MAKE THE ICE CREAM.
NOT YET.
I'M WORKING ON IT.
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
A SINGLE FRANCHISE.
AND YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO.
IT'S A START?UP.
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL YOU?
UM, THE ICE CREAM GAVE ME
A BRAIN FREEZE. I'M OUT.
TIM, I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,
BUT YOU HAVE
NO FRANCHISE COMPANY, OKAY?
IT'S A SMALL BUSINESS.
THANK YOU FOR??FOR COMING HERE
TODAY, BUT I'M OUT.
I THINK I'D HAPPILY BUY
ICE CREAM FROM YOU.
YOU SEEM LIKE THE PERFECT
ICE CREAM KIND OF GUY.
BUT YOU'RE HERE TOO EARLY,
YOU'RE HERE TOO UNPREPARED.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, TIM.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, ALL.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
(Robert) ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
I DON'T THINK THE SHARKS
SAW THE BEAUTY IN...
WHAT THIS BUSINESS COULD BE.
I??I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.
(laughs)
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF ICE CREAM IN HERE.
OKAY, GET OUT OF THE WAY.
I'M GONNA START IT.
KICK IT.
KICK IT UP, BABY.
BOYS WILL BOYS.
(laughing)
I'M LEAVING. (laughs)
(laughs)
(O'Leary) BYE?BYE.
LATER!
(imitates engine revving)
THE NUMBER OF TIMES
PEOPLE USE MY PACKET.
I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN.
ABSOLUTELY.
HOWEVER,
THERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT MY??
MY COMPETITION TO HAVE THIS?
AND THEY BURY IT.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
NASTY ABOUT YOU I REALLY LIKE.
(Robert laughs)
OH. (chuckles) I'M... I THINK
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
NO, NO, I LIKE IT.
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
IS CREATE A BIDDING WAR
IN A VERY,
VERY STRUCTURED MARKET.
AND SPEAKING PLAINLY,
THERE'S THE FEEDING FRENZY.
RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
CURRENTLY, I'M A MECHANICAL
ENGINEER. I'M IN BETWEEN.
AND SOME DAY?TRADING
IN THE MARKET.
AND WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS IDEA FROM?
I WAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP
AND, 11:00 AT NIGHT,
I STOPPED WITH MY WIFE
AND SAID,
"LET'S HAVE A SLICE OF PIE
AND CUP OF COFFEE."
I HAD A BUSINESS MEETING
THE NEXT DAY.
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT, AND I <i>KNOW</i>
SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME DECAF.
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO
TELL, AND THAT'S TO DRINK IT.
SO WHAT'S WITH THE $200,000?
IT'S JUST A NUMBER
YOU PULLED OUT OF THE AIR?
THERE IS, UM, UH,
LICENSING FEES,
THERE'S ATTORNEY FEES,
AS YOU KNOW,
AND WE HAVE TO
SET UP A CORPORATION.
AND I NEED SOME HELP. I NEED
YOU GUYS TO OPEN UP DOORS.
IF ONE OF YOU ARE INTERESTED,
I WANT TO ADVANCE THIS.
I WANT TO MOVE IT FORWARD.
(Barbara) I'M GONNA JUMP IN??
I'LL??
IN HERE,
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE TWO
REAL WEAKNESSES TO THIS IDEA.
I'M NOT SURE THE CONSUMER
IS THAT PARANOID
ABOUT TESTING AND MISTRUSTING
WHETHER THEY GOT
CAFFEINATED COFFEE
OR DECAFFEINATED COFFEE??
THAT'S ONE??
AND THE SECOND REASON IS,
WITH ANY OF THESE
PROSPECTIVE BUYERS
YOU'RE HOPING TO SELL TO,
IT'S NOT JUST THE MINIMAL COST
OF ADDING IT TO THE PACKET.
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO MARKET
THE IDEA
AND LET THE CONSUMER KNOW,
AND THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
IT'S NOT SUCH AN EASY,
CLEAR ROAD TO MY MIND
AS YOU'RE POSITIONING IT.
SO FOR THOSE TWO REASONS ONLY,
I'M OUT.
THOSE ARE EXCELLENT POINTS,
BARBARA.
IT WAS A FAIR DEAL.
IT WAS A FAIR DEAL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED? YOU NEVER
EVEN GAVE AN OFFER, DID YOU?
(Robert) I JUST NEEDED??
I JUST NEEDED CONTROL.
HE'S JUST MOUTHING OFF.
(Harrington)
I WASN'T GIVING HIM A CHANCE.
I SAID IF HE ACCEPTS MY OFFER,
IT'S A DEAL. WE'RE DONE.
NO, I GOT IT.
I JUST??JUST??
SOMEBODY KEPT HIM QUIET.
I WASN'T QUITE THERE.
DAYMOND, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE LEARNED?
TALK IS CHEAP,
AND SO IS KEVIN O'LEARY.
(sharks laugh)
I FEEL LIKE FINALLY...
AFTER 18 YEARS OF KEEPING
THIS THING BOTTLED UP,
I FINALLY PARTNERED
WITH THE RIGHT MAN
TO HELP ME BRING THIS
TO FRUITION.
IT'S GREAT!
I FEEL EXCITED.
I ENDED UP SPENDING MORE TIME
IN COFFEEHOUSES
THAN COURTHOUSES.
AND THEN IT HIT YOU.
THE...
AND THEN IT HIT YOU.
IT HIT ME.
I REALIZED THAT A COFFEEHOUSE
WOULD BE THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR A LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER...
THAT COULD CATER TO THE UNMET
NEEDS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS.
WHY THE MIDDLE CLASS?
WELL, THE MIDDLE CLASS??
I'M FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS.
SO AM I.
WELL, IN??PEOPLE WITH,
UH, LOWER INCOMES,
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL AID.
AND THE WEALTHY HAVE
THEIR OWN LAWYERS ON RETAINER.
THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS NEITHER.
SO WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT IT?
I MOVED BACK HOME, AND WITH
THE HELP OF MY FAMILY,
I OPENED UP
LEGAL GRIND COFFEE &amp; COUNSEL
IN SANTA MONICA.
LEGAL GRIND OFFERS ITS
TRADEMARK??COFFEE &amp; COUNSEL??
AND AN à LA CARTE MENU
OF LEGAL SERVICES
AT AFFORDABLE PRICES
FOR PURCHASE.
IT IS YOUR ONE?STOP SHOP.
I CAN'T GET FIVE MINUTES
OF MY LAWYER'S TIME
FOR ANY OF THOSE NUMBERS.
BUT THE DOCUMENT SERVICES
ARE NOT PERFORMED BY A LAWYER...
YOU DON'T??ARE NOT HIRING
A LAWYER.
THEY'RE HAVING DOCUMENTS
PREPARED,
BECAUSE MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
AND THEN THIS ALSO
HOW MUCH OF YOUR TIME
DOES IT TAKE
TO ACTUALLY SERVICE THAT DEAL?
I CAN PREPARE ONE
IN TEN MINUTES.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE??
YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHILE THEY'RE HAVING A COFFEE
WHICH YOU SOLD FOR $2.50??
I CAN INTERVIEW THEM AND HAVE
THEM PREPARED IN TEN MINUTES.
AND HAVE YOU
DONE THAT BEFORE?
YES.
I'VE MANAGED THE SANTA MONICA
STORE FOR SEVEN YEARS.
PEOPLE LIKE TO ACTUALLY
TALK TO A...
THEY DO. I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY TIMES...
A WARM?BLOODED HUMAN BEING.
I'VE HAD SOMEBODY COME IN THAT
DID SERVICES OVER THE INTERNET,
AND THEY WERE NOT HAPPY.
WHEN IT COMES TO
CERTAIN LEGAL SERVICES,
A LAWYER DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE THERE THE WHOLE TIME.
HOW DO YOU GET THE PEOPLE
TO COME IN TO YOUR STORE?
WORD OF MOUTH.
'CAUSE YOU SAID YOU??
IF YOU??IF YOU SAID
IF YOU SAID
IT'S A LEGAL PLACE??
IT'S ALL WORD OF MOUTH,
ALL WORD OF MOUTH.
AND BECAUSE WE'RE EVERY??
WE'RE IN A LOCATION
WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY,
"OH, WHAT'S THAT PLACE?
WHAT'S THAT PLACE."
WE KNOW THAT WITH JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT JUST TO HELP US
PUT A LOCATION
IN A HIGH?FOOT?TRAFFIC AREA,
MARKET IT AND ADVERTISE IT,
IT WILL MAKE MONEY.
AND DUPLICATE IT
TIMES A HUNDRED."
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE GOT
THAT OILED MACHINE YET.
I'M OUT NOW. THANK YOU.
WELL, IN 2001, WE WON
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION'S
LEGAL ACCESS AWARD.
AND THAT AWARD IS GIVEN
TO AN ORGANIZATION
THAT IS EXEMPLARY
AND REPLICATIBLE.
THAT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO.
EIGHT YEARS AGO.
WE STILL NEVER HAD THE CAPITAL
TO RUN A BUSINESS THE RIGHT WAY.
ALL OF YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
CAPITAL TO DO IT.
COME ON. THAT'S CRAP.
YOU HAVE A BAD IDEA HERE.
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT
FOR 14 YEARS,
AND YOU WAKE UP ONE DAY AND SAY,
"I'M GONNA TAKE MY IDEA
AND NOW I'M GONNA FRANCHISE IT.
GIVE ME $200,000."
NO, WE DIDN'T JUST WAKE UP.
I'M OUT.
