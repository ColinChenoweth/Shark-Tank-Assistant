AND TO TAKE THIS PRODUCT
TO MARKET SUCCESSFULLY.
IT'S NOT AVAILABLE
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE MARKET.
IT INCLUDES THIS LIPSTICK MOLD,
WHICH IS THE SECRET WEAPON
TO CREATING
BEAUTIFUL LIPSTICKS AT HOME
IN A FEW MINUTES
IN YOUR KITCHEN.
THE REASON WHY I NEEDED
THIS PRODUCT SO BADLY IS BECAUSE
I HAD PERSONALLY
OVER $250 WORTH OF LIPSTICK
THAT I COULDN'T WEAR.
I GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
OF THAT TUBE,
THERE'S ONE?THIRD OF MY LIPSTICK
THAT DOESN'T TWIST UP.
MANY WOMEN ARE WASTING THAT.
NOW WITH LIPSTIX REMIX, I COULD
TAKE A COUPLE OF THOSE COLORS,
MIX THEM TOGETHER
AND CREATE A BEAUTIFUL SHADE
THAT I LOVE.
NOW IS THE TIME
TO TAKE LIPSTIX REMIX
AND THREE TUBES
OF YOUR FAVORITE COLOR
AND THAT'S ENOUGH LIPSTICK
TO MAKE A BRAND?NEW TUBE
FOR FREE.
JILL, HOW DOES IT WORK?
LET ME SHOW YOU REAL QUICK.
YOU TAKE THE COLORS
YOU WANT TO MIX TOGETHER.
JUST PUT THEM
IN YOUR MEASURING CUP.
NOW YOU PUT THIS IN
THE MICROWAVE FOR 45 SECONDS.
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
WITH THIS, OKAY?
YOU TAKE YOUR LIPSTICK MOLD.
IT'S REALLY EASY.
YOU JUST FILL IT UP
TO THE TOP THERE.
AND THAT GOES INTO THE FREEZER
FOR TEN MINUTES.
NOW I DO HAVE ONE THAT'S ALREADY
READY HERE FOR US.
THIS IS
THE REALLY EXCITING PART.
OKAY, YOU JUST POP OFF THE TOP.
OKAY?
SO ALL YOU DO IS
YOU TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN,
AND YOU'RE READY TO PULL IT
OUT OF THE TUBE.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT TWISTS UP AND DOWN
AND LOOKS LIKE
A BRAND?NEW TUBE OF LIP SHADE.
(Barbara) AND IT DOESN'T
FALL OUT?
NO.
SO WOULD I BE ABLE TO TELL
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
NEW LIPSTICK
AND NUKED LIPSTICK?
WELL, IN FACT,
YOU WOULD NOT.
THE MAJOR MANUFACTURERS HEAT
AND REHEAT THEIR LIPSTICK
ALL THE TIME.
JILL, I'M A GUY.
I DON'T OFTEN WEAR LIPSTICK.
(Jill laughs)
BARBARA, IS THIS
A GOOD IDEA OR NOT?
IT'S SO CLEVER.
AND NOT ONLY
FOR THE REASONS YOU SAY,
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
NOTHING'S MORE EXCITING
THAN A NEW LIPSTICK.
EXACTLY.
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT NOW?
WE HAVE SOLD
ALMOST 800 UNITS
IN A VERY, VERY SMALL
LOCAL MARKET.
HOW?
I SET UP A TABLE IN THE MALL
FOR TEN DAYS AT CHRISTMAS.
WE SOLD 254 UNITS.
A LITTLE OVER 6 GRAND.
HOW MUCH DO ONE
OF THESE THINGS SELL FOR?
THIS IS $19.95.
(Robert) JILL,
AGREE WITH ME ON THIS??
IF YOU DON'T GET THIS ON
A TV SHOPPING CHANNEL
TYPE OF FORMAT,
IT'S NEVER GONNA SELL.
THIS IS PURELY A ONE?DIMENSIONAL
GO?TO?MARKET STRATEGY.
THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK RETAIL.
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK WHOLESALE.
IT CAN ONLY BE SOLD THROUGH,
UH, HARRINGTON'S FORMAT.
AND I HAVE NO ACCESS TO THAT.
I'M OUT. I'M OUT
BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP YOU.
YOU KNOW,
I MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU,
BECAUSE THERE ARE
A LOT OF PRODUCTS
ON RETAIL SHELVES RIGHT NOW
THAT STARTED OUT
IN DIRECT RESPONSE.
IN FACT,
I'M NOT BEING UNREALISTIC.
I UNDERSTAND THAT $105,000
IS GONNA GET US A GOOD TEST.
WE'RE GONNA DO A TEST
IN A SMALL, LOCAL MARKET.
AND WHEN WE HAVE
INCREASED OUR AWARENESS,
THEN WE GO TO
THE NUMBER ONE TV RETAILER,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE GET 90 MILLION MORE HOMES.
THEN WE GO AND WE PUT THEM
ON THE SHELVES
BECAUSE WOMEN KNOW
LIPSTIX REMIX.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
THIS WILL SELL,
AND WE WILL SELL SEVEN
FOR EVERY ONE WE SELL ON TV.
(sighs) BOY.
PRESENTATION'S GREAT.
YOU'RE GREAT.
YOU'RE A TERRIFIC SALESMAN.
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
BUT I'M VERY FRUSTRATED
BECAUSE THIS IS
ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS
WHERE I ACTUALLY...
I'VE GOT A LITTLE GUY
ON ONE SHOULDER SAYING,
"DO IT. IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
AND SCREW UP HARRINGTON
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT."
THE OTHER SIDE SAYS,
"YOU'RE NOT A LIPSTICK GUY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
SO I'M GONNA LISTEN TO MY "I'M
NOT A LIPSTICK GUY" ON THIS ONE,
AND SAY, I'M OUT,
BUT WITH HUGE RESERVATIONS.
I THINK YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO PUT IN $105,000.
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU HALF THE CASH.
OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HUSTLE
ONE OF THE OTHER SHARKS
TO GET THE REST.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $105,000
FOR...
(Daymond) 40%.
AND I CANNOT WAIT TO TAKE
THIS PRODUCT TO MARKET.
I HAVE THE POWER TO DO THIS DEAL
AND MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
IT WOULD BE BEST TO WORK
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.
SO THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU RICH.
THANK YOU.
DO YOU OWN A NATIONAL TRADEMARK
FOR THE CAPTAIN ICE CREAM??
YES, I OWN THE TRADEMARK.
IF YOU HAVE
THE NATIONAL TRADEMARK,
THAT MEANS NOBODY ELSE CAN CALL
THEMSELVES CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ICE CREAM
TO GIVE US?
OF COURSE.
(Robert) CAN I HAVE SOME?
SURE. WOULD YOU ALL LIKE SOME?
(Daymond) YOU SHOULDA DONE THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER ONE SELLING PRODUCT.
TIM, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
DID YOU MAKE THIS ICE CREAM?
NO. THIS IS BOUGHT
FROM A COMPANY.
BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
MY NUMBER ONE PRODUCT.
IT'S DELICIOUS.
CAPTAIN, WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE THE, UM,
CAPTAIN ICE CREAM MOPED?
A BRAND?NEW VERSION OF THIS
WILL COST ABOUT $7,000.
SO WHAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL?
HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL
IN A DAY, CAPTAIN?
UM, GENERALLY ABOUT $200 WORTH
OF ICE CREAM IN??IN 4 HOURS.
OH...
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.
$200 A DAY?
(Barbara) FOUR HOURS.
IN??IN FOUR HOURS.
GENERALLY AN EVENT IS??
IS FOUR HOURS.
WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?
IT'S EASY TO MAKE
$25 PER HOUR AS A VENDOR.
BUT WHAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL
FOR ME AS AN INVESTOR?
YOU WANT $48,000 FOR WHAT?
I WANT TO BUILD
A COUPLE OF MOPEDS.
I WANT TO START WORKING ON
AN ELECTRIC VERSION OF THIS.
OKAY?
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE NOW?
HOW MANY MOPEDS?
THIS IS IT.
JUST THE ONE?
AND ARE YOU MAKING A LIVING?
I'M??I'M BARELY
EKING OUT A LIVING.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL IT
TO OTHER FRANCHISEES,
AND YOU'RE BARELY MAKING
A LIVING?
I DON'T, BECAUSE I'M STILL
LEARNING THE BUSINESS.
OKAY, YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA
FRANCHISE THIS.
HAVE YOU HIRED
ANY FRANCHISE LAWYERS?
(laughs)
DO YOU HAVE DOCUMENTS PREPARED?
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
KEVIN, HE'S MAKING $25
AN HOUR SELLING ICE CREAM.
(Harrington) RIGHT.
RIGHT NOW I'M SELLING...
A CONCEPT.
SEVERAL DIFFERENT BRANDS??
YOU'RE REALLY SELLING A CONCEPT
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
YES. IF I BUY
A FRANCHISE FROM YOU,
LET ME WALK IN THAT GUY'S SHOES.
OKAY.
HOW MUCH COULD I REASONABLY
EXPECT TO EARN IF I WAS WORKING
FOUR HOURS A DAY,
FIVE DAYS A WEEK?
BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUMBER
YOU THREW OUT, FOUR HOURS??
MORE THAN YOU'RE MAKING
IN REAL ESTATE TODAY.
(Barbara) PROBABLY. (laughs)
(laughs)
YOU COULD EASILY MAKE $25,000
TO $50,000 A YEAR
AS AN ICE CREAM PERSON.
I GET WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU SELL ICE CREAM.
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IS,
BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN MAKE
A MOPED WITH A FREEZER ON IT.
YEAH, BUT CAN THEY?
THAT'S THE THING.
CAN THEY? YOU KNOW??
YEAH, THEY CAN.
(Daymond)
TIM, I THINK IT'S A?A CRIME
FOR ME TO INSULT
AN ICE CREAM MAN.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
JUST INNOCENT AND BEAUTIFUL
ABOUT AN ICE CREAM MAN.
I CAN APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.
BUT THE BUSINESS
IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR ME.
BUT I DO LOVE YOUR, UH,
YOUR??YOUR ATTITUDE
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
BUT I'M OUT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, BEC??
ALL RIGHT, THINK ABOUT IT.
OKAY, IT'S A VERY INEXPENSIVE
FRANCHISE??
WELL, THINK ABOUT
MY POINT OF VIEW.
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS,
HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
WELL, YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK
IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.
HOW?
FIRST OF ALL,
SAY THE FRANCHISE IS $12,500
TO BE A FRANCHISEE
OF CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.
OKAY, SO??
WHY WOULD ANYBODY GIVE YOU
$12,000 WHEN THEY COULD JUST??
WHY NOT? YOU'RE GONNA SELL THEM
ICE CREAM AT A DISCOUNT
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT A CONCEPT
OF WHICH NOTHING IS...
UNIQUE AND PATENTABLE OR??
YOU DON'T THINK
THIS IS UNIQUE?
ADMIT IT. IT'S UNIQUE.
AT LEAST GIVE THE GUY THAT.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE DECIDED?
I'M GONNA GIVE??
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $48,000
OF BARBARA'S MONEY.
(laughs)
(laughs)
YOU KNOW,
I??I'M HOLDING MYSELF BACK,
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN CHILDREN
AND WONDERFUL, WARM AND??
AND THINGS FROM THE PAST.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO RECREATE HERE.
BUT??BUT I CAN'T MAKE
ANY MONEY.
AND I WANT YOU
TO GET BACK ON THAT THING
AND RIDE INTO THE SUNSET,
BECAUSE??
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE, THOUGH,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A FRANCHISE FEE...
NO, I REALLY DO BECAUSE,
I HAVE TO??HERE'S THE PROBLEM??
AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A PROFIT
ON EVERY BIKE.
HERE'S THE BUSINESS REALITY
IN THIS.
OKAY.
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SEND YOU AN INVOICE
FOR ABOUT $2,000 FOR MY TIME.
(laughs)
I GONNA TAKE OFF 50 CENTS
FOR THE ICE CREAM, THOUGH.
OKAY. IT'S $1.50, BY THE WAY.
$1.50? THAT'S AN OUTRAGE.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S A 400% MARKUP
ON ICE CREAM.
THERE'S JUST NOTHING HERE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
(Daymond) SAY THE WORD.
I'M OUT.
I WANT TO SUMMARIZE
WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME,
JUST SO I'M CLEAR.
OKAY, SURE.
YOU BARELY MAKE ANY MONEY
DOING THIS TODAY.
YOU DON'T MAKE THE ICE CREAM.
NOT YET.
I'M WORKING ON IT.
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
A SINGLE FRANCHISE.
AND YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO.
IT'S A START?UP.
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL YOU?
UM, THE ICE CREAM GAVE ME
A BRAIN FREEZE. I'M OUT.
TIM, I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,
BUT YOU HAVE
NO FRANCHISE COMPANY, OKAY?
IT'S A SMALL BUSINESS.
THANK YOU FOR??FOR COMING HERE
TODAY, BUT I'M OUT.
I THINK I'D HAPPILY BUY
ICE CREAM FROM YOU.
YOU SEEM LIKE THE PERFECT
ICE CREAM KIND OF GUY.
BUT YOU'RE HERE TOO EARLY,
YOU'RE HERE TOO UNPREPARED.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, TIM.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, ALL.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
(Robert) ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
I DON'T THINK THE SHARKS
SAW THE BEAUTY IN...
WHAT THIS BUSINESS COULD BE.
I??I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.
(laughs)
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF ICE CREAM IN HERE.
OKAY, GET OUT OF THE WAY.
I'M GONNA START IT.
KICK IT.
KICK IT UP, BABY.
BOYS WILL BOYS.
(laughing)
I'M LEAVING. (laughs)
(laughs)
(O'Leary) BYE?BYE.
LATER!
(imitates engine revving)
NOW DID YOU EVER WONDER WHY
THERE'S A DECAF MARKET?
IT'S EITHER BECAUSE PEOPLE
DON'T WANT CAFFEINE
OR CAN'T HAVE CAFFEINE FOR
MEDICAL OR FOR PERSONAL REASONS.
THE FACT IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN YOUR COFFEE OR NOT.
ENTER CAFFEINDICATOR.
IT'S THE FIRST
LITMUS?LIKE TESTER
INCORPORATED
ON A SWEETENER PACKET
WHICH CHANGES COLOR
IN THE PRESENCE OF CAFFEINE.
IS IT INK IN THE PAPER
OR IN THE SUGAR?
IT'S ON THE PAPER.
IT'S AN INK.
IT'S MICROENCAPSULATED
IN GELATIN.
(Robert) BUT, MICHAEL,
DOES IT REALLY WORK?
OH, CERTAINLY IT DOES WORK.
ABSOLUTELY.
LET ME DEMONSTRATE
A MOCK PROTOTYPE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, IF THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN THE COFFEE,
IT WILL TURN PINK.
IT'S DYNAMIC. IT'S CURIOUS.
IT'S FUN TO SHARE.
AND HEY, I DON'T EVEN USE
A SWEETENER IN MY COFFEE,
BUT I JUST USED A PACKET.
THE SWEETENER PACKET MARKET IS
ROUGHLY A $12?BILLION MARKET,
OF WHICH, THE BLUE GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE PINK GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE GREEN GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE YELLOW GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
AND THE WHITE GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE.
NOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF
ANY ONE OF THESE MANUFACTURERS
WERE ABLE TO DRAMATICALLY
INCREASE THEIR SHARE
IN THIS GLOBAL MARKET?
DOES THAT HAVE VALUE?
YES.
OF COURSE IT DOES.
SHARKS, WELCOME TO
THE SUGAR BOWL BRAWL.
THESE GUYS ARE ALL FIGHTING
FOR MARKET SHARE.
SO WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO TAKE A $500?MILLION PRODUCT
TO A $1?BILLION PRODUCT?
BUT IS THERE AN INDICATION
OF IT HEAVILY CAFFEINATED
OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS?
NO, IT DOESN'T TELL ME
HOW MUCH CAFFEINE.
IT TELLS ME WHETHER OR NOT
THERE IS CAFFEINE.
ALMOST LIKE A PREGNANCY TEST??
VERY SIMILAR. IN FACT,
THAT WAS PART OF THE??
BUT DOESN'T??DOESN'T DECAF??
HAS ABOUT 2 MILLIGRAMS
OF CAFFEINE IN IT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
VERSUS 120 MILLIGRAMS.
BUT IT'S STILL
GONNA TRIGGER THE TEST.
I CAN MASK OUT
THE FALSE POSITIVES.
(Robert) YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT OF THIS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
THE PERSON WANTS TO KNOW
WHETHER THERE'S CAFFEINE OR NOT.
IT'S THE FACT THAT THE WHITE GUY
CAN SAY TO THE YELLOW GUY,
"MY PACKET'S BETTER
BECAUSE IT DOES THIS."
I GET IT. I GET THAT.
(O'Leary) AND I AGREE WITH YOU.
THAT'S IT!
(Michael) THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
THE MANUFACTURING
AND THE DISTRIBUTION
IS ALREADY IN PLACE.
WHAT WE'RE LEVERAGING IS MARKET
SHARE IN A GLOBAL INDUSTRY.
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN PARTNERING WITH ME
ON THIS VENTURE.
SO, MICHAEL, WHEN YOU WENT
TO THE BLUE GUYS,
AND SAID,
"I HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA,
BUY MY PRODUCT,"
WHAT DID THEY SAY?
I HAVE NOT GONE
TO THE BLUE GUYS YET.
WHY NOT?
I CAME TO YOU GUYS TO SEE
IF YOU CAN OPEN THE DOORS
AND PARTNER WITH ME IN??
ON THIS.
YOU'VE NEVER TRIED TO TALK TO
ANY OF THE WHITE, YELLOW,
GREEN, PINK, BLUE GUYS?
NO, SIR. I HAVE NOT.
AND DO YOU OWN THE PATENT??
I DO.
HOW MUCH WILL THIS ADD
TO THE COST OF EACH PACKET?
IT HAS TO BE NEGLIGIBLE.
(Robert) YOU DON'T KNOW
THE NUMBER?
UH, UH, NO. THE FACT
OF THE MATTER
IS THAT ANYTHING YOU MAKE
IN MASS QUANTITY,
THE??THE??THE??THE PRICE
OF IT DROPS.
WHAT'S YOUR COST
TO MAKE ONE PACK NOW?
I DON'T HAVE A COST TO MAKE
ONE PACK RIGHT NOW.
WHAT??GIVE US A NUMBER. WE JUST
WANT A FEEL FOR THE NUMBER.
(Robert) VOLUME??YEAH.
HERE'S MY THOUGHT ON THAT.
UM, IF I INCREASE
MARKET SHARE DRAMATICALLY,
THE COST OF PRODUCTION
GOES DOWN, PROFIT GOES UP.
(Barbara) YES.
GIVE US A NUMBER.
YEAH, WE??WE GET THAT,
BUT CAN IT BE MADE
FOR A FRACTION OF PENNIES MORE?
ABSOLUTELY.
IT CAN?
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, MICHAEL,
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, BASICALLY,
IS YOU DEFINED
YOUR ENTIRE MARKET.
THAT'S GOOD. IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.
THE BAD IS, IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.
IF ONE OF THESE COLOR
DON'T BUY YOUR PRODUCT,
THERE IS NO MARKET.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
THAT'S CORRECT.
BUT WAIT A MINUTE. YOUR STRATEGY
IS TO GO TO ALL FIVE AND SAY,
"WHICH ONE OF YOU WANTS TO
INCREASE YOUR MARKET SHARE?"
SO THE REAL QUESTION
ON YOUR DEAL IS,
IF I'M ONE OF THESE
MARKETEER MANUFACTURERS,
I HAVE TO BUY INTO YOUR PREMISE
THAT PUTTING AN INDICATOR
FOR CAFFEINE
IS GOING TO
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE
THE NUMBER OF TIMES
PEOPLE USE MY PACKET.
I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN.
ABSOLUTELY.
HOWEVER,
THERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT MY??
MY COMPETITION TO HAVE THIS?
AND THEY BURY IT.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
NASTY ABOUT YOU I REALLY LIKE.
(Robert laughs)
OH. (chuckles) I'M... I THINK
I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
NO, NO, I LIKE IT.
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
IS CREATE A BIDDING WAR
IN A VERY,
VERY STRUCTURED MARKET.
AND SPEAKING PLAINLY,
THERE'S THE FEEDING FRENZY.
RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
CURRENTLY, I'M A MECHANICAL
ENGINEER. I'M IN BETWEEN.
AND SOME DAY?TRADING
IN THE MARKET.
AND WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS IDEA FROM?
I WAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP
AND, 11:00 AT NIGHT,
I STOPPED WITH MY WIFE
AND SAID,
"LET'S HAVE A SLICE OF PIE
AND CUP OF COFFEE."
I HAD A BUSINESS MEETING
THE NEXT DAY.
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT, AND I <i>KNOW</i>
SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME DECAF.
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO
TELL, AND THAT'S TO DRINK IT.
SO WHAT'S WITH THE $200,000?
IT'S JUST A NUMBER
YOU PULLED OUT OF THE AIR?
THERE IS, UM, UH,
LICENSING FEES,
THERE'S ATTORNEY FEES,
AS YOU KNOW,
AND WE HAVE TO
SET UP A CORPORATION.
AND I NEED SOME HELP. I NEED
YOU GUYS TO OPEN UP DOORS.
IF ONE OF YOU ARE INTERESTED,
I WANT TO ADVANCE THIS.
I WANT TO MOVE IT FORWARD.
(Barbara) I'M GONNA JUMP IN??
I'LL??
IN HERE,
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE TWO
REAL WEAKNESSES TO THIS IDEA.
I'M NOT SURE THE CONSUMER
IS THAT PARANOID
ABOUT TESTING AND MISTRUSTING
WHETHER THEY GOT
CAFFEINATED COFFEE
OR DECAFFEINATED COFFEE??
THAT'S ONE??
AND THE SECOND REASON IS,
WITH ANY OF THESE
PROSPECTIVE BUYERS
YOU'RE HOPING TO SELL TO,
IT'S NOT JUST THE MINIMAL COST
OF ADDING IT TO THE PACKET.
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO MARKET
THE IDEA
AND LET THE CONSUMER KNOW,
AND THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
IT'S NOT SUCH AN EASY,
CLEAR ROAD TO MY MIND
AS YOU'RE POSITIONING IT.
SO FOR THOSE TWO REASONS ONLY,
I'M OUT.
THOSE ARE EXCELLENT POINTS,
BARBARA.
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
MICHAEL REALIZES,
HIS 25% IS LUDICROUS.
(O'Leary) THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A NEGOTIATION, ROBERT.
THAT'S LIKE BASICALLY SAYING
THAT YOU'LL DO THIS DEAL,
BUT YOU WANT MORE THAN 25%,
AND YOUR GREED IS SHOWING.
THAT SHOULD BE
FAMILIAR TO YOU.
I SAW YOUR GREED.
I SAW YOUR GREED.
YOU KNOW, MIKE, I WAS
ON THE FENCE FOR A SECOND,
BUT I AGREE WITH BARBARA
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO
VERY POINTED
AND SPECIFIC MARKETING.
I LIKE THE IDEA
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTACK
THE NUMBER ONE DRUG
SOLD IN THE WORLD.
BUT I AM OUT.
MICHAEL, I'LL PAY FOR AN OPTION
TO SEE IF ONE
OF THE FIVE GUYS DO IT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
FOR...
60%...
CONTINGENT ON GETTING A DEAL
WITH ONE OF THE FIVE COMPANIES.
LEGAL GRIND OFFERS ITS
TRADEMARK??COFFEE &amp; COUNSEL??
AND AN à LA CARTE MENU
OF LEGAL SERVICES
AT AFFORDABLE PRICES
FOR PURCHASE.
IT IS YOUR ONE?STOP SHOP.
(Jeff)
IT'S A PLACE WHERE ANYBODY
CAN CONVENIENTLY ACCESS
AFFORDABLE LEGAL INFORMATION,
SERVICES AND REPRESENTATION.
(whispers) WITH YOUR FUNDING.
WITH YOUR FUNDING
AND EXPERTISE,
WE WILL FRANCHISE
LEGAL GRIND LOCATIONS.
(Annie) SO FOR THE SAKE
OF JUSTICE,
WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE
FUND US.
JEFF AND ANNIE,
WHATEVER HAPPENS HERE TODAY,
I WANT YOU BOTH TO KNOW THIS??
YOU HAVE A FUTURE
IN BAD THEATER.
(laughs)
THANKS.
ANNIE, DO WE GET A COFFEE?
OH, YEAH.
CAN YOU SERVE HIM ONE?
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'D BE ANY GOOD.
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SELL
ANY LEGAL SERVICES YET.
THIS IS A CONCEPT.
NO. JEFF STARTED THIS
IN 1996 IN SANTA MONICA.
(Robert) YOU'VE HAD THIS FOR?
13 YEARS.
SO ARE YOU MAKING ANY MONEY?
UH, WE'RE GROSSING
ABOUT $200,000 A YEAR.
ARE YOU NETTING ANY MONEY?
UM, I THINK... YOU KNOW,
$20,000, $30,000 A YEAR.
MOST??MOST OF THE INCOME
GO TO OUR SALARIES,
'CAUSE WE'VE HAD TO RAISE
A FAMILY.
WELL, HOW MUCH
DO YOU TAKE IN SALARY
BEFORE THAT LEFTOVER MONEY
FOR PROFIT IS THERE?
UH, MAYBE $50,000.
EACH?
SO, JEFF AND ANNIE,
JUST SO I'M VERY CLEAR...
OKAY.
YOU'VE COMBINED A COFFEE SHOP
WITH LEGAL SERVICES.
YES, TO SERVE
THE MIDDLE CLASS, BECAUSE??
TELL 'EM. I MEAN, THERE'S??
THE MIDDLE CLASS IS...
NOT GETTING
THEIR LEGAL SERVICES MET.
I GET THE IDEA.
I LIKE THE TARGET MARKET.
OKAY.
BUT YOU'RE LOSING ME ON THE FACT
THAT TO GET INTO YOUR BUSINESS,
I HAVE TO GO INTO
THE RETAIL COFFEE BUSINESS.
NO, YOU DON'T.
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A COFFEEHOUSE SETTING.
IT'S JUST A PLACE TO START,
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR LAWYERS
HAVE THEIR OWN OFFICES
AND EVERYTHING.
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU WOULD BE COMING THERE
FOR ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THAT LAWYER.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY YOU WANT TO BE
IN THE LOW?MARGIN
LEGAL SERVICES BUSINESS
AND COFFEE HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT?
WELL, I?I DON'T THINK
IT MIGHT BE LOW MARGIN. UH??
I'M LOOKING AT THESE PRICES.
I CAN'T GET FIVE MINUTES
OF MY LAWYER'S TIME
FOR ANY OF THOSE NUMBERS.
BUT THE DOCUMENT SERVICES
ARE NOT PERFORMED BY A LAWYER...
YOU DON'T??ARE NOT HIRING
A LAWYER.
THEY'RE HAVING DOCUMENTS
PREPARED,
BECAUSE MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
AND THEN THIS ALSO
HELPS US, TOO, WITH UPSELLING.
OKAY, ANNIE,
WALK ME THROUGH ONE.
I'LL TAKE HEALTH CARE DIRECTIVE
FOR $100.
OKAY.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR TIME
DOES IT TAKE
TO ACTUALLY SERVICE THAT DEAL?
I CAN PREPARE ONE
IN TEN MINUTES.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE??
YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHILE THEY'RE HAVING A COFFEE
WHICH YOU SOLD FOR $2.50??
I CAN INTERVIEW THEM AND HAVE
THEM PREPARED IN TEN MINUTES.
AND HAVE YOU
DONE THAT BEFORE?
YES.
I'VE MANAGED THE SANTA MONICA
STORE FOR SEVEN YEARS.
SO DO WE HAVE TO FIND
LOTS MORE JEFF AND ANNIES
THAT WANT TO WORK?
NO, WE DON'T.
WELL, YOU SAID YOU'RE
FRANCHISING THEM, RIGHT?
I KNOW, BUT IT'S US??
IT'S TRAINING
THE RIGHT PERSON.
BUT, JEFF,
YOU'RE AN ACCREDITED LAWYER.
IS THERE ANY LAWS
ABOUT HAVING COFFEE WAITRESSES
PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES?
(laughs)
NO, AS LONG AS SHE'S NOT
PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE.
SHE'S A DOCUMENT ASSISTANT.
ISN'T THIS MUCH BETTER DONE
ON THE INTERNET
WHERE THERE'S NO
BRICK?AND?MORTAR COST INVOLVED?
WHY THE COFFEE SHOP?
PEOPLE LIKE TO ACTUALLY
TALK TO A...
THEY DO. I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY TIMES...
A WARM?BLOODED HUMAN BEING.
I'VE HAD SOMEBODY COME IN THAT
DID SERVICES OVER THE INTERNET,
AND THEY WERE NOT HAPPY.
WHEN IT COMES TO
CERTAIN LEGAL SERVICES,
THEY WANT TO INTERACT.
ANNIE, CRAZY IDEA.
JUST OPEN UP A STORE
THAT SAYS "LEGAL SERVICES."
RIGHT.
NOBODY WOULD COME IN 'CAUSE
THEY DON'T TRUST LAWYERS.
(laughs)
THERE'S TRUTH IN THAT.
WHAT IF YOU'RE JUST SITTING
IN A COFFEE SHOP
TALKING TO A LAWYER?
IT'S BRINGING
SOMEBODY TOGETHER??
PEOPLE GO
TO OTHER PLACES AND SIT
AND MEET WITH THEIR LAWYER.
(O'Leary) ALL RIGHT.
THE COFFEE HAS TO DO WITH
JUST MAKING SOMEBODY
FEEL COMFORTABLE...
YES.
ADDRESSING THEIR DIFFICULT
LEGAL ISSUES.
BUT WHY IS IT??
WHY IS IT COFFEE AND LAWYERS?
WHY ISN'T IT PIZZA AND LAWYERS?
WHY ISN'T IT
DRY CLEANER AND LAWYERS?
WHERE'S THE DIGNITY
IN PIZZA AND LAWYERS?
WHAT, THERE'S DIGNITY IN COFFEE?
CAN I SHOW YOU A LIST
OF FRANCHISEE REQUESTS
THAT WE'VE RECEIVED?
YOU HAVE A LIST
OF FRANCHISEE REQUESTS?
OH, OVER A HUNDRED.
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE DOWN PAYMENTS
ON THE FRANCHISEE REQUESTS?
THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE 20 FRANCHISEE REQUESTS
WORTH $10,000 APIECE.
RIGHT.
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE POSITION TO KNOW
HOW OR WHAT TO DO
WHEN WE GET THESE REQUESTS.
YEAH, BUT THEN
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ONCE WE GIVE YOU THE $200,000?
YOU'RE STILL NOT GONNA KNOW.
WELL, YOU HIRE??
YES.
YOU HIRE LEGAL CONSULTANTS.
(Harrington) HMM.
NOT LEGAL??
FR?FRANCHISE CONSULTANTS.
(laughs)
(laughs) YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO THE COFFEE SHOP.
DO YOU SEE THE IRONY?
DO YOU SEE THE IRONY THERE?
YOU'RE GONNA
JUMP OVER THE COUNTER
AND SIT WITH A LAWYER.
LET'S SAY I SAY, "LOOK,
I WANT TO BE IN THE COFFEE
AND LEGAL SERVICES BUSINESS."
THEN I'D ASK THIS QUESTION??
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES
YOUR COFFEE/LEGAL STORE MAKE?
AND THAT ANSWER IS ZERO.
NO. IT MAKES MONEY.
NO, IT DOESN'T.
YES, IT DOES.
AFTER YOU PAY YOURSELVES
A NORMAL SALARY,
THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE.
ANNIE, YOU'VE GOTTA WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE MONEY.
THERE ISN'T ANY.
HOW AM I GONNA PAY A FRANCHISE
FEE TO YOU IF I'M NOT PROFITING?
WELL, OKAY.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF MONEY IN MARKETING.
JEFF, ANSWER THIS FOR ME.
LET'S SAY I TAKE MY HARD?EARNED
200,000 BUCKS
AND HAND IT TO YOU TODAY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT MONEY?
WELL, I THINK, BARBARA,
YOU AND I
WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS IT.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN
AS TO HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE USE OF THAT MONEY?
WE TAKE $115,000
AND OPEN UP
A PROTOTYPE STORE.
THAT STORE SHOULD BE MAKING
$300,000.
AND FIND ANOTHER
LITTLE ANNIE THERE
TO SIT AND SERVE THE COFFEE,
TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY.
A LEGAL DOCUMENT ASSISTANT,
SO THE??
A LAWYER DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE THERE THE WHOLE TIME.
HOW DO YOU GET THE PEOPLE
TO COME IN TO YOUR STORE?
WORD OF MOUTH.
'CAUSE YOU SAID YOU??
IF YOU??IF YOU SAID
IF YOU SAID
IT'S A LEGAL PLACE??
IT'S ALL WORD OF MOUTH,
ALL WORD OF MOUTH.
AND BECAUSE WE'RE EVERY??
WE'RE IN A LOCATION
WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY,
"OH, WHAT'S THAT PLACE?
WHAT'S THAT PLACE."
WE KNOW THAT WITH JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT JUST TO HELP US
PUT A LOCATION
IN A HIGH?FOOT?TRAFFIC AREA,
MARKET IT AND ADVERTISE IT,
IT WILL MAKE MONEY.
ANNIE, YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
YES, WE DO.
YOU BARELY GET BY TODAY.
IF YOU ADD MARKETING COSTS...
BECAUSE WE DON'T ADVERTISE
AND WE DON'T MARKET.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
ANY MONEY.
EVERY MONEY THAT WE MAKE,
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE TO TURN??
(Barbara)
YOU'VE NEVER ADVERTISED?
(Jeff) IF WE WORK PROPERLY??
ANNIE, ANNIE, ANNIE, GUYS,
I THINK YOU'VE HAD
A LITTLE BIT
TOO MUCH COFFEE TODAY.
(laughs)
YOU HAVE TO JUST CALM DOWN
AND LISTEN TO US.
