IT'S NOT AVAILABLE
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE MARKET.
IT INCLUDES THIS LIPSTICK MOLD,
WHICH IS THE SECRET WEAPON
TO CREATING
BEAUTIFUL LIPSTICKS AT HOME
IN A FEW MINUTES
IN YOUR KITCHEN.
THE REASON WHY I NEEDED
THIS PRODUCT SO BADLY IS BECAUSE
I HAD PERSONALLY
OVER $250 WORTH OF LIPSTICK
THAT I COULDN'T WEAR.
I GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
OF THAT TUBE,
THERE'S ONE?THIRD OF MY LIPSTICK
THAT DOESN'T TWIST UP.
MANY WOMEN ARE WASTING THAT.
NOW WITH LIPSTIX REMIX, I COULD
TAKE A COUPLE OF THOSE COLORS,
MIX THEM TOGETHER
IN A VERY, VERY SMALL
LOCAL MARKET.
HOW?
I SET UP A TABLE IN THE MALL
FOR TEN DAYS AT CHRISTMAS.
THIS IS PURELY A ONE?DIMENSIONAL
GO?TO?MARKET STRATEGY.
THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK RETAIL.
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK WHOLESALE.
IT CAN ONLY BE SOLD THROUGH,
UH, HARRINGTON'S FORMAT.
WE'RE GONNA DO A TEST
IN A SMALL, LOCAL MARKET.
DO YOU OWN A NATIONAL TRADEMARK
FOR THE CAPTAIN ICE CREAM??
YES, I OWN THE TRADEMARK.
IF YOU HAVE
THE NATIONAL TRADEMARK,
THAT MEANS NOBODY ELSE CAN CALL
THEMSELVES CAPTAIN ICE CREAM.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ICE CREAM
TO GIVE US?
OF COURSE.
(Robert) CAN I HAVE SOME?
SURE. WOULD YOU ALL LIKE SOME?
(Daymond) YOU SHOULDA DONE THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER ONE SELLING PRODUCT.
TIM, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
DID YOU MAKE THIS ICE CREAM?
NO. THIS IS BOUGHT
FROM A COMPANY.
BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
MY NUMBER ONE PRODUCT.
IT'S DELICIOUS.
CAPTAIN, WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE THE, UM,
$1.50? THAT'S AN OUTRAGE.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S A 400% MARKUP
ON ICE CREAM.
THERE'S JUST NOTHING HERE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
(Daymond) SAY THE WORD.
I'M OUT.
I WANT TO SUMMARIZE
WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME,
JUST SO I'M CLEAR.
OKAY, SURE.
YOU BARELY MAKE ANY MONEY
DOING THIS TODAY.
YOU DON'T MAKE THE ICE CREAM.
NOT YET.
I'M WORKING ON IT.
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
A SINGLE FRANCHISE.
NOW DID YOU EVER WONDER WHY
THERE'S A DECAF MARKET?
IT'S EITHER BECAUSE PEOPLE
DON'T WANT CAFFEINE
OR CAN'T HAVE CAFFEINE FOR
MEDICAL OR FOR PERSONAL REASONS.
THE FACT IS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN YOUR COFFEE OR NOT.
ENTER CAFFEINDICATOR.
IT'S THE FIRST
LITMUS?LIKE TESTER
INCORPORATED
ON A SWEETENER PACKET
WHICH CHANGES COLOR
IN THE PRESENCE OF CAFFEINE.
IS IT INK IN THE PAPER
OR IN THE SUGAR?
IT'S ON THE PAPER.
IT'S AN INK.
IT'S MICROENCAPSULATED
IN GELATIN.
(Robert) BUT, MICHAEL,
DOES IT REALLY WORK?
OH, CERTAINLY IT DOES WORK.
ABSOLUTELY.
LET ME DEMONSTRATE
A MOCK PROTOTYPE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, IF THERE'S
CAFFEINE IN THE COFFEE,
IT WILL TURN PINK.
IT'S DYNAMIC. IT'S CURIOUS.
IT'S FUN TO SHARE.
THE SWEETENER PACKET MARKET IS
ROUGHLY A $12?BILLION MARKET,
OF WHICH, THE BLUE GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE PINK GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE GREEN GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
THE YELLOW GUYS
HAVE MARKET SHARE,
IN THIS GLOBAL MARKET?
DOES THAT HAVE VALUE?
YES.
OF COURSE IT DOES.
SHARKS, WELCOME TO
THE SUGAR BOWL BRAWL.
THESE GUYS ARE ALL FIGHTING
FOR MARKET SHARE.
SO WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO TAKE A $500?MILLION PRODUCT
TO A $1?BILLION PRODUCT?
BUT IS THERE AN INDICATION
OF IT HEAVILY CAFFEINATED
OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS?
NO, IT DOESN'T TELL ME
HOW MUCH CAFFEINE.
IT TELLS ME WHETHER OR NOT
THERE IS CAFFEINE.
ALMOST LIKE A PREGNANCY TEST??
VERY SIMILAR. IN FACT,
THAT WAS PART OF THE??
BUT DOESN'T??DOESN'T DECAF??
HAS ABOUT 2 MILLIGRAMS
OF CAFFEINE IN IT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
VERSUS 120 MILLIGRAMS.
BUT IT'S STILL
GONNA TRIGGER THE TEST.
I CAN MASK OUT
THE FALSE POSITIVES.
(Robert) YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT OF THIS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
THE PERSON WANTS TO KNOW
WHETHER THERE'S CAFFEINE OR NOT.
IT'S THE FACT THAT THE WHITE GUY
CAN SAY TO THE YELLOW GUY,
"MY PACKET'S BETTER
BECAUSE IT DOES THIS."
I GET IT. I GET THAT.
WHAT WE'RE LEVERAGING IS MARKET
SHARE IN A GLOBAL INDUSTRY.
UM, IF I INCREASE
MARKET SHARE DRAMATICALLY,
THE COST OF PRODUCTION
GOES DOWN, PROFIT GOES UP.
(Barbara) YES.
GIVE US A NUMBER.
YEAH, WE??WE GET THAT,
BUT CAN IT BE MADE
FOR A FRACTION OF PENNIES MORE?
ABSOLUTELY.
IT CAN?
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, MICHAEL,
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, BASICALLY,
IS YOU DEFINED
YOUR ENTIRE MARKET.
THAT'S GOOD. IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.
THE BAD IS, IT'S VERY CLEAR
WHO WE HAVE TO SELL IT TO.
IF ONE OF THESE COLOR
DON'T BUY YOUR PRODUCT,
THERE IS NO MARKET.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
THAT'S CORRECT.
"WHICH ONE OF YOU WANTS TO
INCREASE YOUR MARKET SHARE?"
SO THE REAL QUESTION
ON YOUR DEAL IS,
IF I'M ONE OF THESE
MARKETEER MANUFACTURERS,
I HAVE TO BUY INTO YOUR PREMISE
THAT PUTTING AN INDICATOR
FOR CAFFEINE
IS GOING TO
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE
THE NUMBER OF TIMES
PEOPLE USE MY PACKET.
I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN.
ABSOLUTELY.
HOWEVER,
THERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT MY??
MY COMPETITION TO HAVE THIS?
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO MARKET
THE IDEA
LEGAL GRIND OFFERS ITS
TRADEMARK??COFFEE &amp; COUNSEL??
I GET THE IDEA.
I LIKE THE TARGET MARKET.
OKAY.
BUT YOU'RE LOSING ME ON THE FACT
THAT TO GET INTO YOUR BUSINESS,
I HAVE TO GO INTO
THE RETAIL COFFEE BUSINESS.
NO, YOU DON'T.
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A COFFEEHOUSE SETTING.
IT'S JUST A PLACE TO START,
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR LAWYERS
IS PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF MONEY IN MARKETING.
JEFF, ANSWER THIS FOR ME.
LET'S SAY I TAKE MY HARD?EARNED
200,000 BUCKS
YOU BARELY GET BY TODAY.
IF YOU ADD MARKETING COSTS...
