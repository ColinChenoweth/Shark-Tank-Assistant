THE PRIMARY FUNCTION
IS TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE DRIVER HAS ON
HIS OR HER SEAT BELT.
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO, UH,
I HAD A LOVED ONE
THAT LOST HER SISTER
TO A, UH, CAR CRASH.
THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH
IN OUR COUNTRY--
RESOUNDINGLY--
IS TRAFFIC CRASHES.
IF YOU HAVE ON A PROPERLY WORN
SHOULDER HARNESS,
THE CHANCES OF YOU WALKING AWAY
FROM A TRAFFIC CRASH UNINJURED
OR NOT DECEASED
GO UP BY UP TO 86%.
HELLO. MY NAME
IS MARY ELLEN SIMONSEN.
I HAVE CREATED A PRODUCT THAT
WILL KEEP YOUR STICKY NOTES
IN PLACE AND ORGANIZED
WHILE WORKING AT YOUR COMPUTER.
I AM HERE TO ASK FOR
$100,000 IN-INVESTMENT
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
I CREATED THIS PRODUCT
BECAUSE I WAS TIRED
OF LOSING STICKY NOTES
AND HAVING TO REPOSITION THEM
ALL DAY LONG.
THIS EXAMPLE HERE
IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT
WE'RE ALL USED TO SEEING.
THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE IN IT.
THERE'S BEEN NO SOLUTION TO IT
UNTIL TODAY.
YOU SIMPLY ATTACH IT
TO YOUR LAPTOP OR YOUR DESKTOP,
AND YOU PUT
ALL YOUR NOTES HERE.
YOU CAN ALSO ATTACH IT
TO THIS SIDE.
MARY ELLEN, YOU'VE CREATED
A STICKY PAD FOR STICKY PADS.
I CREATED AN ARM
FOR STICKY PADS.
THAT'S WORTH
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS?
YES.
PLEASE TELL ME WHY.
ALL YOU--
ALL YOU SIMPLY DO IS--
IS SWING THE SLEEVE IN
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GO.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
NONE OF 'EM FALL OFF.
OH, I SEE WHY IT'S WORTH
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
THANK YOU!
IT FOLDS INTO THE COMPUTER.
(sharks laugh)
OF COURSE THAT MAKES SENSE
TO ME NOW.
YOU'VE SOLD HOW MANY?
I HAVE SOLD NONE.
EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT.
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP THIS
A SECRET.
IT'S SO VALUABLE THAT NOBODY
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS.
COME ON.
WHO'S GONNA BUY THIS
FROM YOU?
THIS YEAR ALONE,
56 MILLION LAPTOPS WILL BE SOLD
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
AND EVERY ONE OF THEM
DOESN'T NEED YOUR STICK ARM.
THIS YEAR ALONE,
OVER 400 MILLION LAPTOPS
WILL BE SOLD WORLDWIDE.
HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?
WHAT WOULD I PAY FOR THAT?
UH, $9.50.
STOP THE MADNESS.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
(Daymond) $9.50 FOR ONE?
YES.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
YES.
WHO WOULD GIVE YOU
10 BUCKS FOR THAT?
A LOT OF PE--
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
MARY, CONVINCE ME WHY THIS ISN'T
THE WORST IDEA I'VE EVER SEEN.
THIS YEAR ALONE, THERE'LL BE
56 MILLION LAPTOPS--
OKAY, YOU GOTTA
STOP THAT RIGHT AWAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY PEOPLE COME TO ME
AND SAY "IF I CAN GET 1% OF 1%
OF THE BILLION"...
YOU--YOU... ZERO FROM ZERO
IS STILL ZERO.
SO FORGET THAT. LET THAT GO.
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.
GIVE ME ANOTHER REASON
WHY THIS IS GREAT.
THIS IS SOLVING A PROBLEM
THAT EVERYBODY HAS
WHO USES STICKY NOTES--
I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM.
WHO USES STICKY NOTES
WHILE WORKING AT THEIR LAPTOP.
HAVE YOU SHOWN THIS TO ANYBODY
THAT SAID,
"I LIKE THIS
AND WE'LL SELL IT FOR YOU"?
I HAVE NOT
BECAUSE I HAVE NOT
SECURED A PATENT YET.
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
OR THE MONEY ON THE PATENT.
I THINK NO SALES,
A USELESS IDEA. I'M TOTALLY OUT.
IF YOU
WALKED IN HERE TODAY
WITH SOME KIND OF INTEREST
IN THIS PRODUCT,
UH, I THINK YOU MAY BE GETTING
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT REACTION
FROM US RIGHT NOW.
SO I'M OUT.
I DON'T THINK YOUR PRODUCT
IS WORTH WHAT YOU'RE ASKING,
BUT I DO THINK YOU HAVE
A PRODUCT THERE.
AND I THINK FOR $10 A POP
ON A QVC-TYPE STATION--
WHAT PLANET
DID YOU COME FROM?
YEAH. NO, LET ME TELL YOU.
I THINK YOU COULD SELL IT.
I LOVE THIS LADY. YOU'RE SOLID
ON YOUR FEET, ALL RIGHT?
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE A BUSINESS OF THIS.
YOU KNOW, BARBARA--
SO FROM ME, I'M OUT,
BUT NOT BECAUSE OF YOU.
I THINK YOU NEED A NEW PRODUCT,
BUT I'M OUT.
BARBARA, YOU GOTTA,
YOU GOTTA STOP THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S WHY SHE'S HERE.
SHE'S HERE WITH A HORRIBLE IDEA
BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN HER FAMILY
OR HER FRIENDS SAID THAT, TOO.
I'M NOT HER FRIEND.
"YOU'RE REALLY NICE,"
AND ENCOURAGED YOU.
HAVE YOU SPENT ANY OF YOUR OWN
MONEY DOING THIS?
I'VE SPENT ABOUT $1,000.
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. YOU SHOULD
STOP. FIND SOMETHING ELSE.
MOVE ON. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU.
(Harrington)
GOOD LUCK, MARY ELLEN.
