HI. MY NAME IS SUSAN KNAPP,
AND I AM THE CREATOR OF
A PERFECT PEAR FROM NAPA VALLEY.
I'M RAISING $500,000
FOR A 15% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY.
OW!
(laughs) I TURNED
MY PASSIONATE HOBBY
OF MAKING MY SIGNATURE PRODUCT--
CINNAMON PEAR JELLY--
INTO A BUSINESS.
IT'S EVOLVED INTO A LINE
OF EXTRAORDINARY,
AWARD-WINNING
GOURMET FOOD PRODUCTS.
BUT DO YOU HAVE SALES?
WE'VE GROWN TO OVER $700,000
IN SALES.
WELL, WELL, WELL, WELL.
SO WHAT'S THE NET PROFIT?
AT THE END OF 2009,
WE EXPECT OUR NET PROFIT
TO BE 2.43%.
THAT'S ABOUT $15,000.
AT THE END OF, UH, 2010,
WE EXPECT OUR NET PROFIT
TO BE 10.5%.
(man) THANK YOU.
YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME.
SUSAN, IT'S FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MMM. THAT'S GOOD.
MMM.
HOW MANY TOTAL STORES
ARE YOU ACTUALLY IN?
ABOUT 650.
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY FOR?
WE NEED THE MONEY
TO HELP US WITH PRODUCTION.
I CURRENTLY HAVE OVER $100,000
WORTH OF ORDERS
THAT OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE EAGERLY WAITING FOR.
YOU CAN'T GET FINANCING
FROM A BANK OR SOMEBODY ELSE?
IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT
RIGHT NOW.
EVEN A LOT OF
THE ANGEL INVESTORS
SUSAN, DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE PAST. DOESN'T MATTER.
OKAY,
EVERYBODY LOVES YOUR STUFF.
YOUR PACKAGING'S FANTASTIC.
YOU PRESENT VERY, VERY WELL.
PUT THAT ASIDE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MONEY.
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE EMOTION
OUT OF IT AND MAKE IT REAL.
HOW ABOUT THIS DEAL?
500K...
AND YOU GIVE UP 70%
OF YOUR COMPANY.
ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF I WOULD ACCEPT THAT?
YES.
NO, THANK YOU.
OKAY, I HAVE $500,000...
FOR 51%.
51%?
51% TO ME.
I CONTROL THE COMPANY.
I'D GO 50%.
HALF A MILLION FOR 50%.
I'D GO IN ON THAT DEAL.
I THINK 50 IS FAIR,
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU NEED THE MONEY,
WE GOTTA HAVE
SOME LEVEL OF CONTROL.
SO I'M IN WITH KEVIN
ON THAT DEAL.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
WELL, LET'S SEE--
SUSAN, LET'S BE CLEAR.
KEVIN AND I ARE OFFERING YOU
$500,000
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY.
WHY DEAL WITH TWO GUYS WHEN YOU
COULD JUST DEAL WITH ONE
FOR 51%?
I WOULDN'T THROW OUT THE 70%
THAT LEAVES YOU WITH 30,
'CAUSE YOU GET TO WORK
WITH MR. WONDERFUL. THAT'S ME.
(laughs)
(laughs)
SUSAN, WE HAVE--
YOU HAVE AN OFFER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
(exhales deeply)
YOU WANT TO GO IN THE DARK
AND THINK ABOUT IT?
FOR JUST A SECOND?
(Daymond) YOU WANT TO
STEP OUT ONE SECOND?
YEAH, GO AHEAD. PHONE
YOUR HUSBAND IF YOU HAVE TO.
DOES HE OWN
ANY OF THE BUSINESS?
NO.
(Barbara laughs)
(Harrington) HE JUST PUT
ALL THE MONEY IN.
OOH, THAT'S MEAN.
I LIKE HER EVEN MORE NOW.
FIRST OF ALL,
WHAT IS THIS 50% STUFF?
WE CAN GET 70% HERE.
EASILY. WE CAN GET 80%.
SHE SAID NO.
SHE SAID NO TO YOUR 70%.
(Harrington)
SHE TURNED YOU DOWN.
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE 51.
YOU GUYS ARE TAKING MY DEAL,
ALMOST, FOR 1 POINT.
NO, BUT YOU GUYS, YOU UNDERCUT
ME BY GOING DOWN TO 50--
AND THEY UNDERCUT ME.
YEAH, THEY UNDERCUT HIM.
IT'S ALL FAIR. COME ON.
SHE WASN'T GONNA--
SHE'S NOT GONNA TAKE THAT.
(O'Leary) ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET HER BACK.
SUSAN, YOU WANT TO COME BACK.
SUSAN HAS TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE,
BOTH ASKING FOR A BIGGER CHUNK
OF HER COMPANY.
I LOVE THE FACT THAT
YOU'VE GOT $700,000 IN SALES,
YOU'VE GOT $100,000 IN ORDERS
WAITING TO BE FULFILLED.
I LOVE THAT, OKAY?
(O'Leary) SUSAN,
THINK ABOUT THIS.
YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
I WILL--OH, GOSH.
I-I WILL SAY YES TO.
YES.
(Barbara) HEY.
GOOD CHOICE.
AHA. AHA.
SHE'S GONNA SAY NO,
HUH, DAYMOND?
YOU TOOK ME FOR 1%.
SHE'S GONNA SAY NO, HUH?
SHE'S GONNA REGRET IT.
AH. SUSAN, YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
WELL, AND HE LOVES
THE PRODUCT ALREADY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
OUTSTANDING.
THANK YOU.
GOOD MATCH.
(Daymond) THAT IS A--
THAT IS A GOOD DEAL.
THAT IS A GREAT LADY.
GREAT LADY.
