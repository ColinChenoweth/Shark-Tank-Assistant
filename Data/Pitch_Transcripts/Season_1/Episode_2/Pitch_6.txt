HIS GENIUS MARKETING
OF PRODUCTS
SUCH AS THE OBAMA COIN
AND THE ROCK 'N ROLL STEPPER
HAS AMASSED
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SALES.
DAYMOND JOHN LITERALLY TURNED
RAGS TO RICHES
WITH HIS CLOTHING BRAND FUBU,
WHICH HAS GROSSED OVER
$6 BILLION
IN WORLDWIDE RETAIL SALES
TO DATE.
WE ARE TARGETING A MARKET
THAT IS BOOMING RIGHT NOW--
THE M.M.A.--
MIXED MARTIAL ARTS INDUSTRY.
IT'S HUGE RIGHT NOW WITH
THE YOUNG KIDS, AND WE BELIEVE
THAT WE COULD BE THE NEXT
BIG BRAND IN THE INDUSTRY.
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY PRODUCT YET?
WE HAVE SOLD
ABOUT 1,500 UNITS.
WE'RE IN ABOUT TEN
MOM-AND-POP
SURF-AND-SKATE SHOPS
ON LONG ISLAND.
WE JUST OPENED UP, UH,
OUR OWN ONLINE RETAIL SHOP
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO.
WHAT'S ON THE T-SHIRT THERE,
THE RED ONE?
CAN I SEE A DESIGN JUST TO GET
AN IDEA OF THE FLAVOR OF IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S A NASTY LOOKING CLOWN.
SHOW EVERYBODY.
THE AUTOMOTIVE
AFTERMARKET BUSINESS...
OH.
IS A HUGE BUSINESS.
THE PROBLEM IS, JUST LIKE
WHEN I JUST WALKED IN HERE,
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THIS EXISTED.
AND SO WHEN I CALL ON
SOME OF THE BIGGER
NATIONWIDE AUTO CHAINS,
THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF ME,
TO MAKE SURE
THAT PRODUCT HITS THE MARKET.
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
WE--WE WANT KIDS TO...
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SUGGEST THAT.
I APOLOGIZE IF THAT'S
HOW IT WAS PERCEIVED.
THINK ABOUT IT. YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A BUSINESS GUY.
NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.
YOU'RE A BUSINESS GUY.
YOU STARTED FROM A GOOD PLACE.
MM-HMM.
BUT YOU'RE
UNBELIEVABLY STUBBORN,
AND I THINK EVERYBODY HERE,
ALL THE SHARKS,
SEE THE VERY OBVIOUS WAY TO
MAKE MONEY AT THIS EXCEPT YOU.
AND EVERY TIME
WE THROW IT TO YOU,
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE IT,
BUT THEN YOU WANT TO GO OFF
AND RUN AND BUILD A BUSINESS.
I DON'T WANT TO BUILD
A BUSINESS.
I WANT TO TAKE THE PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE.
AND AGAIN, IT'S FLATTERING,
BUT NO, THANK YOU.
THAT ARE USUALLY AVAILABLE
IN THIS MARKET
HAVE BEEN
PRETTY DIFFICULT TO REACH.
THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM
WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN AMERICA TODAY
IS PEOPLE CAN'T GET CREDIT.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
DESERVING PEOPLE WITH
REAL BUSINESSES AND REAL ORDERS
CAN'T GET CREDIT.
MY CONCERN IS,
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT MAKING,
REALLY, MUCH PROFIT.
2% PROFIT ON $700,000--
THAT'S PROJECTED FOR THIS YEAR.
THAT'S A $15,000 PROFIT.
DON'T YOU THINK
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
AND VALUING YOUR COMPANY FOR
IS TOO HIGH?
I PERSONALLY HAVE OVER $800,000
INVESTED IN THIS.
MY NAME'S MARC FURIGAY.
I LIVE IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.
AND MY PRODUCT IS GONNA
REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY
THINGS ARE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL.
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL
ENGLISH TEACHER.
I'VE BEEN TEACHING
FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS.
(students laugh)
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED READING,
AND I LOVE KIDS AS WELL,
SO AS A TEACHER, I WANTED
TO SHARE THIS ENTHUSIASM
WITH THE KIDS.
NOW TODAY WE'RE GONNA DO AN EVEN
DEEPER CHARACTER ANALYSIS
OF LADY MACBETH.
IT GOT PRETTY FRUSTRATING
WHEN A LOT OF KIDS
HAD A HARD TIME GETTING INTO
WHAT THEY WERE READING,
UH, PARTICULARLY SHAKESPEARE.
THEY JUST TUNED OUT.
SO I FIGURED THERE HAD TO BE
A BETTER WAY TO GET THEM
INTO THE LITERATURE.
SO I CREATED SOMETHING
NEW, INNOVATIVE,
AND IT COMPLETELY CHANGED
THE CLASS DYNAMIC.
WHO IS THE STRONGER,
HARDER CHARACTER,
MACBETH OR LADY MACBETH?
IN ALL MY YEARS OF TEACHING,
I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS
ANYTHING THAT WORKS
NEARLY AS WELL
AS THE PRODUCT I'VE CREATED.
IT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT TURNED HIM INTO
THE RUTHLESS KING THAT HE WAS.
THEIR MARRIAGE WAS GOOD.
YOU THINK LADY MACBETH
STARTED OFF GOOD?
SHE STARTED OFF GOOD.
IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER GREED.
THE TITLE OF THE PLAY IS
"MACBETH" BECAUSE HE'S BETTER.
(laughing)
WHAT I WANT TO SHOW THE SHARKS
IS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST
AN AMAZINGLY EFFECTIVE
TEACHING TOOL,
BUT IT IS AN AMAZING
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.
MY NAME IS MARC FURIGAY.
I'M THE CREATOR AND FOUNDER
OF CLASSROOM JAMS--
AN EDUCATIONAL RECORD LABEL
AND PUBLISHING HOUSE
SET TO LAUNCH.
I'M HERE SEEKING $250,000
FOR A 10% STAKE IN THE COMPANY.
AS A TEACHER
IN CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
I SAW A VERY HUGE NEED
FOR TEACHING TOOLS
THAT ACTUALLY WORKED.
NO MATTER WHAT RESOURCES
WE HAD, KIDS KEPT FAILING,
AND TEACHERS KEPT BURNING OUT.
ONE DAY, UH, WHEN I WAS
REALLY STRUGGLING
TO GET KIDS INTERESTED
IN SHAKESPEARE,
A STUDENT OF MINE
SUMMED UP THE PROBLEM PERFECTLY.
SHE SAID, "MR. FURIGAY,
WHY CAN'T YOU GIVE US SOMETHING
WE CAN RELATE TO?"
I TOOK THOSE WORDS TO HEART.
THE NEXT DAY,
I CAME IN WITH A SONG.
I--I'LL PLAY YOU
JUST THE FIRST VERSE.
IT'S CALLED
"THE JUBILEE OF JULIET, PART 1."
(plays guitar notes)
? THE JUBILEE OF JULIET ?
? HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET ?
? BUT GET THE PARTY ON TONIGHT ?
? AND YO
THERE'S GONNA BE A FIGHT ?
? CAN YOU FEEL
THE FEELING YET ?
? OF FIERY TYBALT CAPULET? ?
? SEE TYBALT HATED MONTAGUES ?
? THE FAMILY
AND THE FEELING TOO ?
WELL, THE KIDS LOVED IT.
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
(Daymond) VERY GOOD,
VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
OKAY. HOW DO WE MAKE MONEY?
WE MAKE MONEY BY SELLING
OUR, UH, CLASS SETS
TO SCHOOLS NATIONWIDE.
MARC, DO YOU OWN A-A COPYRIGHT
TO THAT SONG? LIKE--
YES.
HAVE YOU WRITTEN
ALL THE SHAKESPEAREAN CLASSICS
MUSICALLY?
I WROTE AND PERFORMED
ALL THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM.
WOW. SO YOU'RE SELLING US
THE ENTIRE RECORD LABEL?
THAT'S PART OF THE BUSINESS?
YES, EXACTLY.
AND THE RIGHTS TO THE SONGS?
UM, I AM NOT SELLING
THE RIGHTS TO THE SONGS.
OOH.
I AM SELLING A STAKE
IN THE RECORD LABEL
AND THE PUBLISHING HOUSE.
BUT WHY NOT THE SONG?
THE SONG IS SOMETHING THAT
I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP CONTROL OF.
YOU ARE A NASTY MAN.
SCHOOL IS YOUR CUSTOMER,
CORRECT?
CORRECT.
WHAT'S THE COST TO THE SCHOOL?
A CLASS SET COSTS, UH, $499,
AND IT INCLUDES 30 CDs
AND THE TEACHER'S GUIDE.
WHY--WHY SHAKESPEARE?
ANY OTHER PROGRAMS, LIKE WHY--
YOU'RE SEEING AHEAD.
PRECISELY.
THE REASON I CHOSE SHAKESPEARE
WAS BECAUSE, UH,
HE IS THE MOST WIDELY TAUGHT
WRITER IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST
TO UNDERSTAND, TOO.
PRECISELY, UM,
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT KIDS REALLY
STRUGGLE WITH THE MOST.
SO ANY OTHER ONES? ARE YOU
DOING ANY OTHER--
UH, THE NEXT THREE, UH,
WE'RE PLANNING ON
WILL TARGET DIFFERENT,
UH, DIFFERENT SUBJECTS--
HISTORY, SCIENCE--
MARC, I'D LIKE YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.
I'D LIKE YOU TO WALK OUTDOORS
FOR A MINUTE. LEAVE US ALONE.
OKAY.
(O'Leary) I-I LIKE THIS DEAL.
THIS IS WHY I WANTED
TO CALL A SESSION TOGETHER.
LET'S NOT
BID AGAINST EACH OTHER.
FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S NO WAY ON
EARTH HE'S WALKING OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT THE PUBLISHING RIGHTS
IN THE DEAL.
$250,000 FOR 100%
OF THE BUSINESS,
AND HE GETS A 5% ROYALTY
AFTER WE RECOUP OUR DOUGH.
I LOVE IT, BUT I MEAN,
I'D LOVE TO BE TALLER, TOO.
I JUST DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA DO IT.
I'M NOT GIVING HIM ANY DOUGH
UNLESS I HAVE TOTAL CONTROL
AND I OWN ALL THE RIGHTS.
THAT'S IT.
MEAN GUY.
BUT A ROYALTY STREAM FOR HIM
CAN BE WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OVER THE--OVER TIME,
SO THIS IS STILL A VERY--
A VERY GOOD OFFER.
CALL HIM BACK IN.
MARC, COME ON DOWN.
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY GUY TODAY,
THAT WE MET.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU RICH,
I THINK.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
REALLY THINK THIS THROUGH.
WE FORM A NEW COMPANY.
WE OWN IT.
WE FUND IT WITH $250,000.
IT'S A PUBLISHING COMPANY
FOR YOU.
JUST LIKE A GREAT ARTIST,
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A ROYALTY--
IN PERPETUITY,
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, 5%.
THE FIVE SHARKS
HAVE OFFERED MARC
UM...
FASCINATING.
I--IT'S A--IT'S A GREAT--
IT'S GREAT TO IMAGINE THAT THE--
YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT.
UM, BUT...
I'D LIKE
TO BUILD THIS COMPANY--
STOP RIGHT THERE.
DO YOU WANT TO BE RICH OR NOT?
I DO WANT TO BE RICH.
WELL, LET'S GET FOCUSED
ON THAT, BUDDY.
BUT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE EVERYDAY ASPECTS
OF SALES, DISTRIBUTION,
MANUFACTURING?
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE
TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO,
AN ARTIST AND A TEACHER?
THIS--THE LATTER SOUNDS IDEAL,
ALTHOUGH, I MUST SAY,
SINCE I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT,
UH, STARTING A BUSINESS,
THE MARKETING, THE SALES,
UH, THE NETWORKING
IS ALSO VERY EXCITING.
IT WON'T BE AFTER A WHILE.
HOW MANY TIMES IN YOUR LIFE
HAVE FIVE PEOPLE SAID,
"LET ME GIVE YOU $250,000
TO START A COMPANY,
"OF WHICH YOU, FOR THE REST
OF THE DAYS YOUR ALIVE,
"MAKE A ROYALTY,
REGARDLESS OF HOW HARD
IT IS FOR US TO SELL IT"?
I GUESS WHAT I'M CONCERNED
WITH IS, 5% FEELS QUITE SMALL.
IN PERPETUITY? FOREVER?
THE MODEL OF ROYALTIES
IS A GREAT DEAL FOR YOU.
YES.
WHY AREN'T YOU JUMPING
ALL OVER THIS?
I SENSE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED.
WELL, THERE IS THE--THE QUESTION
OF THE EQUITY STAKE.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF MAINTAINING
EQUITY IN SOMETHING--
BUT THAT'S NOT THE OFFER
ON THE TABLE, MY FRIEND.
THE OFFER ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW
IS TO SET UP A NEW COMPANY...
MM-HMM.
THAT THE SHARKS OWN,
AND YOU GET,
WHICH IS A GREAT DEAL,
A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE SALES
FOR SIMPLY CREATING MATERIAL.
UM, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
A COUNTEROFFER.
WE'RE ALL EARS.
I WOULD LIKE TO BE, UH,
SIX PLAYERS
AS CO-OWNERS OF THE COMPANY.
IT'S UN-AMERICAN,
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE
ANY RISK.
YOU WANT US TO SPEND
ALL OF OUR DOLLARS,
GIVE YOU FREE EQUITY
AND GET A ROYALTY.
DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
I-I DON'T SEE IT AS FREE--
AND LOOK AT HOW WE'RE STRUGGLING
TO MAKE IT WORK FOR YOU.
I-I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH.
UM, I DON'T SEE IT
AS FREE EQUITY.
DON'T TRY TO BE A SHARK.
YOU--YOU EITHER GET EQUITY
OR YOU DO A ROYALTY DEAL.
I HEAR YOU SAYING
"I LOVE MY BUSINESS."
YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR IT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $250,000.
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU ON MY OWN.
