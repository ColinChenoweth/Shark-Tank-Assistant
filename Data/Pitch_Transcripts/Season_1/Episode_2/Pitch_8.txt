AND ROBERT HERJAVEC, WHO SOLD
HIS INTERNET COMPANIES
FOR OVER $350 MILLION.
NOW THIS SELF-MADE
TECHNOLOGY MAGNATE
IS A VENTURE CAPITALIST
AND RUNS
HIS OWN SOFTWARE COMPANY.
IF THE SHARKS HEAR A GOOD IDEA,
THEY'LL FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A PIECE OF IT.
ROBERT JUST OFFERED YOU NOTHING
AND TOLD YOU TO POUND SAND.
NO, I DIDN'T.
I DIDN'T DO THAT.
I GAVE HIM A SHOT AT THE BRASS
RING. YOU'RE GIVING HIM NOTHING.
YOU'VE JUST SEEN A GUY
SCREW HIS PARTNERS.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
BUT FIRST THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST CONVINCE THE SHARKS
TO INVEST THE FULL AMOUNT
THEIR ASKING FOR
OR THEY'LL WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING.
WHAT WOULD I PAY FOR THAT?
UH, $9.50.
(Daymond) $9.50 FOR ONE?
STOP THE MADNESS.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
YES.
OUCH.
I'M OUT.
I'M OUT ALSO.
HE'S OUT, I'M OUT.
(man) ? THE BEST THINGS
IN LIFE ARE FREE ?
? BUT THAT AIN'T REALLY
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ?
? I NEED MONEY ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
(Robert) YOU'RE MR. CLOTHING.
YOU'RE THE CLOTHING GUY.
YOU'RE THE CLOTHING GUY.
(Barbara) DAYMOND, COME ON.
YOU GONNA INVEST?
(Barbara) GOOD LUCK.
(Robert) GOOD LUCK.
(O'Leary)
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
MY NAME'S ROBERT ALLISON.
I'M THE INVENTOR OF LIFEBELT.
THIS IS MY SON MICHAEL,
AND HE'S GONNA BE
SHOWING US HOW IT WORKS.
FIRST THING I WANT YOU TO DO,
SON, IS TRY AND START THE CAR
WITHOUT PUTTING ON
YOUR SEAT BELT.
(ignition clicks, chime dings)
DID THE CAR START? OKAY.
NO.
ONCE LIFEBELT'S INSTALLED,
A VEHICLE CAN'T BE STARTED
UNTIL THE DRIVER
FASTENS THEIR SAFETY BELT.
PUT ON YOUR SEAT BELT.
GOSH.
THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH
AND KILLER OF TEENS
IN OUR COUNTRY, HANDS DOWN,
IS CAR CRASHES.
TRY IT NOW.
(engine turns over)
AS A PARENT, THERE'S NO WAY
I'D LET MY SON DRIVE
WITHOUT THE PROTECTION
THAT LIFEBELT OFFERS.
I BELIEVE THAT EVERY PARENT
IN THE COUNTRY
WOULD WANT ONE
FOR THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS
IF THEY KNEW LIFEBELT EXISTED.
MY NAME IS ROBERT ALLISON.
I'M THE CREATOR
OF LIFEBELT INC.
I'M HERE TODAY REQUESTING
$500,000 IN FUNDING FOR 10%.
LIFEBELT, IN SHORT,
IS A PIECE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT
THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM
BEING ABLE TO START YOUR CAR
WITHOUT FIRST
BUCKLING YOUR SEAT BELT.
THE REASON I'VE--I'M EXCITED
ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY
IS THAT
IF I CAN GET MY PRODUCT
OUT IN FRONT
OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC,
THEN POSSIBLY WE CAN HELP
TO ELIMINATE
SOME OF THE TEEN FATALITIES
THAT OCCUR EVERY YEAR.
HOW DOES IT WORK EXACTLY?
LIKE I SEE A LITTLE BLACK BOX...
THE LARGER BLACK SQUARE TAPS
INTO THE VEHICLE'S FUSE BOX.
I LOVE THE CONCEPT, ROBERT.
WALK ME THROUGH THE--THE COSTS.
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU SELL
THE UNIT FOR?
WHAT'S IT COST
TO GET IT INSTALLED?
UH, INSTALLED, RIGHT NOW
IN LAS VEGAS,
WHICH IS WHERE I LIVE, I'VE GOT
TWO DIFFERENT SHOPS THERE
THAT DO IT FOR $229 INSTALLED.
COULD AN AVERAGE PERSON
INSTALL THIS HIMSELF OR--
YES.
'CAUSE $229 SOUNDS
A LITTLE PRICEY TO ME.
DO YOU HAVE
A PATENT FOR IT?
OF COURSE. IT'S PATENTED.
I OWN THE PATENT,
THE COPYRIGHT,
I OWN THE FCC LICENSING.
WHY NOT GO TO THE CAR COMP--
LIKE, WHY BUILD A BUSINESS?
'CAUSE IF WE GOT--IF YOU AND I
GOT ONE OF THESE
IN EVERY SINGLE CAR...
WE'D BE VERY, VERY RICH.
'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU,
I LOVE THE IDEA.
I MEAN, I LOVE THE IDEA.
BUT I AM NEVER GONNA BUY
ONE OF THESE...
(Barbara) EXACTLY.
AND THEN TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC.
IT'S TOO MUCH HASSLE.
IF I'M A LARGE CAR MANUFACTURER,
AND I WANT TO PUT THIS IN,
DO I HAVE TO GO TO YOU
FOR THE PATENT?
YES.
SO--SO THAT'S THE BIG ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM.
LIKE, WHY AREN'T YOU DOING THAT?
I-I HAVE SPOKEN TO ENGINEERS
AT ALL THREE OF THE MAJOR
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS
HERE IN THIS COUNTRY.
ONE IN PARTICULAR
IS EXTREMELY INTERESTED,
BUT DOES IT TAKE ANOTHER
FIVE YEARS TO GET TO THAT POINT?
(Harrington) THERE'S
TWO WAYS TO SELL IT.
ONE IS TO--AT THE POINT
OF MANUFACTURE,
THE OTHER IS AT THE TIME--
THE POINT OF SALE OF THE CAR.
THEY'VE NEVER HEARD
OF THE PRODUCT--
BUT, ROBERT, WE KNOW THAT.
SO WHAT IF THEY'VE NEVER
HEARD OF YOU.
NOBODY EVER HEARD OF ME WHEN I
STARTED MY FIRST BUSINESS,
AND I SOLD IT FOR $100 MILLION.
ROBERT, YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY MONEY RIGHT NOW
DOING THIS, ARE YOU?
NO, I'M NOT, NO.
OKAY, SO LET'S--LET'S AGREE
ON ONE THING.
JUST--I WANT
TO HEAR YOU SAY THIS,
'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE
YOU'RE GOING TO.
THE ONLY THING OF VALUE HERE
IS THE PATENT, YES OR NO?
YES.
MY BIGGEST CONCERN
IS NOT SO MUCH YOUR PRODUCT,
BUT I DON'T SEE YOU
SELLING THIS THING.
SO I, FOR ONE,
ON THAT BASIS ALONE, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
UM, YOU KNOW, THE BIGGEST
ISSUE I HAVE HERE
IS--IS THE VALUATION.
UH, $500,000 FOR 10%,
UH, IS--IS JUST--
RIGHT. THAT'S NUTS.
I-I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
ON THE VALUATION BASIS,
ROBERT, I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M--I'M OUT ALSO.
UNTIL THERE IS A CAR COMPANY
LICENSING THIS THING,
THIS WILL BE AN ENDLESS
AND FRUITLESS JOURNEY
OF, UM, SPENDING MONEY.
I'M OUT.
ROBERT, I'LL MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
I'LL BUY YOUR PATENT
FOR $500,000--
100% OF IT.
I WANT TO SEPARATE YOU
FROM THE PATENT,
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CALL ME EVER AGAIN.
ROBERT, I'LL MAKE YOU
A BETTER OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION
FOR 100% OF THE PATENT,
AND YOU CAN CALL ME ONCE.
ROBERT, I'LL MAKE YOU
A BETTER OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION
FOR 100% OF THE PATENT,
AND YOU CAN CALL ME ONCE.
A $1-MILLION OFFER
IS ON THE TABLE,
AND ROBERT IS
ABOUT TO MAKE A DECISION
THAT COULD CHANGE HIS LIFE--
A $1-MILLION DECISION.
I AM GONNA HAVE TO SAY
NO, THANK YOU.
IS THERE ANY PRICE?
YES.
WHAT'S THE PRICE?
MAKE IT A NATIONAL,
RECOGNIZED BRAND.
THERE YOU GO AGAIN. WHY DO YOU
WANT TO GO BACK TO THE BUSINESS?
MAY I PLEASE--
MAY I PLEASE FINISH?
BECAUSE I'M GONNA ANSWER
THE QUESTION,
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT THE MONEY.
I KNOW IT IS,
I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT,
BUT IF YOU TOLD ME...
"I'LL GIVE YOU $30 MILLION,
BUT I'M GONNA PUT IT ON A SHELF
AND NEVER PRODUCE IT"...
WHAT YOU JUST SAID
MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE.
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA
SELL IT TO CAR COMPANIES.
WHY WOULD WE PUT IT
ON A SHELF?
I MEAN,
THAT JUST MAKES NO SENSE.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
THAT'S CRAZY.
HE'S NOT A CORPORATION
TRYING TO TAKE YOUR PRODUCT
TO HIDE IT.
HE JUST WANTS TO MAKE MONEY,
SO THE MORE HE GIVES YOU,
THE MORE
HE'S GONNA WORK HARDER
ROBERT, WE'RE DONE HERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
MY OFFER
WITH ROBERT AS MY PARTNER--
WE'LL EACH--
TOGETHER PUT UP $500,000
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY.
MY OFFER IS...
I WILL GIVE YOU $500,000
FOR 51%.
THAT GIVES ME
CONTROLLING INTEREST,
BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH
ONE PERSON INSTEAD OF TWO.
(laughs)
YOU'RE ALL WONDERFUL.
NOW HERE'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE
TO PROPOSE TO YOU TWO GENTLEMEN
OR TO YOU.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 49/51 SO I
MAINTAIN 51% OF THE COMPANY?
CAN'T DO THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK
FOR KEVIN HARRINGTON,
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT.
NO.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY
I CAN'T DO THAT.
OKAY.
IN A SMALL BUSINESS,
THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE
CAN REALLY INFLUENCE
WHICH WAY WE'RE GONNA GO.
AND I JUST NEED TO BE INVOLVED.
BUT ALONG WITH KEVIN HARRINGTON,
I'M WILLING TO GO WITH YOU
'CAUSE I LIKE YOU.
SO I'M WILLING
TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY,
BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO GIVE YOU
THAT RESPONSIBILITY.
OKAY.
I-I HAVE TO CONTROL MY MONEY.
YOU'VE SPOKEN FOR ME
VERY WELL. THANK YOU, ROBERT.
(Daymond)
YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN ME AN ANSWER.
CAN I HAVE CONTROLLING STAKE
OF YOUR COMPANY FOR 51%?
(blows air)
DO YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT?
BUT, UM...
BUT NO.
AND--AND THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
THEN I'M OUT.
ARE YOU SAYING NO TO DAYMOND
OR ARE YOU SAYING--
I'M SAYING NO TO DAYMOND.
AND YOU TWO GENTLEMEN,
I'M, UM...
(Robert) THAT IS
A GOOD LADY.
AH! I SHOULDA GOT IN
ON YOUR DEAL.
IT FEELS A LITTLE BIT SCARY
TO GIVE UP 50% OF MY COMPANY.
BUT KNOWING THAT MY INTENT
IS TO HAVE THIS BE
A $20-MILLION COMPANY
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS,
WHAT'S 50%?
(Robert) HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
I'VE--I'VE DONE SURVEYS.
THERE'S SO MANY
BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS,
LET ME COUNT THE WAYS.
I'M OUT.
ROBERT HAS MADE MARC
HIS OWN OFFER--
$250,000 FOR 100%
OF THE COMPANY
WITH THE OPTION
TO BUY BACK 49% OF IT
WITH PROFITS
MADE FROM THE BUSINESS.
UH, UH--
EXCUSE ME. YOUR DEAL
HAS NO ROYALTY IN IT.
NO ROYALTY.
SO YOU GET NOTHING.
MAY--MAY I TAKE NOTES?
(chuckles)
NO, SEE, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE NOTES.
ROBERT JUST OFFERED YOU NOTHING
AND TOLD YOU TO POUND SAND
FOR A LONG TIME.
NO, I DIDN'T.
I DIDN'T DO THAT.
I THINK YOU DID.
I GAVE HIM A SHOT
AT THE BRASS RING.
YOU'RE GIVING HIM NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
ALL FIVE SHARKS MADE MARC
AN OFFER TOGETHER,
BUT ROBERT
HAD A CHANGE OF HEART
AND MADE HIM AN OFFER
ON HIS OWN.
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
A-A PER--A COUNTEROFFER.
(O'Leary) JUST BEFORE
YOU MAKE THAT MOVE,
MAYBE YOUR OTHER DEAL
IS GONNA EVAPORATE.
JUST LIKE A DOG
WITH A BONE IN HIS MOUTH
LOOKING AT A REFLECTION
IN THE RIVER,
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE,
BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH,
THE BONE DOESN'T DROP OUT HERE.
HE'S NOT GONNA DO THE DEAL.
HE'S NOT STUPID.
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT YET.
I MEAN, I WENT ALONG WITH IT
BECAUSE I THOUGHT, SURE,
IF HE DOES THE DEAL,
I'M HAPPY TO GO ALONG WITH IT,
BUT HE'S NOT GONNA DO THE DEAL.
ARE YOU GONNA LET THAT BONE
DROP OUT OF YOUR MOUTH?
BECAUSE MAYBE I'LL EVAPORATE
ON THAT.
OBVIOUSLY I'M GETTING CUT OUT
IN ROBERT'S SCENARIO,
AND THAT REALLY MAKES ME
QUITE UNHAPPY, MARC.
I'M LESS INTERESTED
IN, UM, JUST ONE.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING
FIVE RESOURCES.
NOW I'M OFFENDED.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
NOTHING IS WRONG
WITH YOU, ROBERT.
I-I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF
HAVING FIVE BUSINESS PARTNERS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MARC?
FORGET THAT.
THAT'S JUST
WAY TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME.
I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000.
UM, I GET 51%, YOU GET 49%.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?
ROBERT HAS JUST SWEETENED
HIS OFFER
BY GIVING MARC THE 49% STAKE
IN HIS COMPANY
WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY IT BACK.
YOU'VE JUST SEEN GREED.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE SEEN, BUD.
YOU'VE SEEN A GUY
SCREW HIS PARTNERS.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
YEAH, BUT YOU--
AND I WON'T FORGET THIS,
ROBERT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO YOU NEED A HUG, KEVIN?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
ANY HELP FROM ME ON THIS DEAL.
(laughs) AY-YI-YI.
MARC, YOU HAVE TO START
MAKING A DECISION. WHICH ONE?
THAT--THAT WAS WHY
I WANTED TO TAKE NOTES.
YOU KNOW, THE BIG RISK IS YOU'RE
GONNA WALK OUT THE DOOR
SINGING THE BLUES IN "E."
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BIG RISK IS?
I'M GONNA SAY I'M OUT
IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.
WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR WAY TOO LONG.
IT'S GETTING MORE COMP--
IT'S WAY TOO MANY DEALS.
YEAH, IF STUFF IS NOT SIMPLE,
I'M ABOUT TO BE OUT.
AND I'M A SIMPLE GUY.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
UM, I REALLY LIKE
THE IDEA--
I-I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF
HAVING FIVE BUSINESS PARTNERS.
MARC REJECTED ROBERT'S OFFER
IN HOPES OF SECURING A DEAL
WITH ALL FIVE SHARKS TOGETHER.
CAN YOU, UH, REDESCRIBE
WHAT YOUR NEW COMPANY
WOULD LOOK LIKE--
OKAY, ONE MORE TIME
WITH FEELING.
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WRITE
THIS DOWN. IT'S THIS SIMPLE.
WE FUND THE NEW CO.
WITH $250,000,
YOU START MAKING 5% FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE ON SALES,
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
OUR COSTS ARE.
HE HAS NO EQUITY.
HAS NO EQUITY.
IF YOU WANT--
OKAY--
AFTER WE'VE RECOVERED
THE $250,000 INVESTMENT,
WE LET HIM USE
HIS ROYALTY STREAM
TO ACQUIRE THE EQUAL EQUITY
AMONGST OURSELVES.
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. THAT'S
REAL DOLLARS FOR REAL EQUITY,
'CAUSE BY THEN--
IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU'D CONSIDER, MARC?
UM... THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING
I WOULD CONSIDER,
BUT I WOULD LIKE THE ROYALTIES
TO BE, UM, MUCH HIGHER
TO BE ABLE TO, UH,
ATTAIN EQUITY MUCH MORE QUICKLY.
CAN WE DO 8 1/2%?
NO.
NO.
OKAY, SO IT WOULD--
MARC, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE JUST AN ENGLISH TEACHER?
OR REALLY, DID YOU DO AN M.B.A.
AND YOU JUST DIDN'T TELL US?
(Barbara laughs)
UH, I AM SURE I AM--
HE LOOKS LIKE
AN ENGLISH TEACHER.
I'M AN ENGLISH TEACH--
UH, AN ENGLISH TEACHER.
'CAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DRIVE
A DEAL THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET,
IN THIS ROOM
OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL,
YES OR NO?
