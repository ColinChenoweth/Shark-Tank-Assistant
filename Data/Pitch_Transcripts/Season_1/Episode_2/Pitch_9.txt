FIRST INTO THE SHARK TANK
IS CRAIG FRENCH,
WHO BELIEVES HIS BUSINESS
COULD BE THE NEXT BIG THING
IN FASHION.
MY NAME IS CRAIG FRENCH
FROM LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK.
MY PARTNER DENIZ AND I
CAME UP WITH A CLOTHING COMPANY
CALLED CROOKED JAW.
I CAME UP WITH THE NAME
AFTER BREAKING MY JAW
PLAYING COLLEGE LACROSSE.
WE STARTED OFF JUST PRODUCING
A COUPLE OF T-SHIRTS,
AND IMMEDIATELY, WE GOT
RESPONSE FROM PEOPLE.
SOME HAPPY CUSTOMERS,
THEY'LL BE GETTING THIS PACKAGE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
(man) HEY, CRAIG. HOW ARE YOU?
I JUST WANTED TO COME IN
AND SHOW YOU
A COUPLE NEW DESIGNS WE GOT.
I KNOW WE DID WELL WITH THEM
IN THE LAST COLOR,
SO WE FIGURED WE'D DO 'EM--
OH, THIS IS NICE. THIS IS SWEET.
THIS WILL SELL REALLY WELL.
COOL.
I THINK WHAT THE SHARKS
CAN BRING TO OUR BUSINESS
IS ENORMOUS.
THIS ONE STORE
IS NOT GONNA PAY THE BILLS,
THAT'S FOR SURE.
THEIR EXPERIENCE
IN THE BUSINESS WORLD,
THEIR CONNECTIONS,
THE NETWORKING THEY COULD DO
FOR US IS IMMENSE,
BUT IN PARTICULAR, DAYMOND JOHN.
DAYMOND JOHN IS THE FOUNDER
OF FUBU CLOTHING.
STARTED OFF IN HIS MOTHER'S
HOUSE, SIMILAR TO MYSELF.
AND IT SLOWLY TURNED INTO
A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR
CLOTHING BUSINESS.
I'M 26 YEARS OLD
AND STILL LIVING AT HOME.
AS ALL MY FRIENDS
ARE OUT PARTYING,
YOU KNOW,
LIVING THE BACHELOR LIFE,
I'M HOME LIVING WITH MY MOTHER
JUST TO KEEP MY BUSINESS AFLOAT.
CRAIG, YOU HAVE TO EAT.
OKAY, HON?
MY MOTHER HAS BEEN THERE FOR ME
FROM THE GET-GO.
SHE'S BEEN AMAZINGLY SUPPORTIVE.
IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE BACK TO HER
EVERYTHING SHE'S GIVEN TO ME.
HELLO, GUYS.
MY NAME IS CRAIG FRENCH.
I AM HERE
WITH MY CLOTHING COMPANY
CALLED CROOKED JAW.
WE ARE SEEKING
A $200,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 20% EQUITY
OF THE COMPANY.
CRAIG, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
WERE YOU A DESIGNER GUY?
I GOT MY JAW BROKEN.
UH, FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE,
I WAS PLAYING LACROSSE,
AND I SHOT AND SCORED
THE GAME-WINNING GOAL.
EVERYONE CELEBRATES.
I GOT HIT AT THE SAME EXACT TIME
AS I--AS I SCORED THE GOAL.
I'VE HAD EXTENSIVE ORAL SURGERY
ON MY FACE,
HAD TO CUT OFF MY EAR,
GO INTO MY HEAD.
WOW. YOU REALLY GOT HIT.
OH, YEAH. IT WAS ALWAYS
EMOTIONAL FOR ME.
ARE THESE YOUR PARTNERS?
THESE ARE MY TWO PARTNERS
RIGHT HERE.
AND THIS IS
OUR BEAUTIFUL MODEL.
SO IT'S A GREAT STORY.
THANK YOU.
LOVE THE T-SHIRT.
I'M GONNA BUY THAT.
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
THAT T-SHIRT FOR FREE?
YOU COULD HAVE IT, YES.
ALL RIGHT. DAYMOND, HOW MANY
GUYS LIKE THAT ARE OUT THERE?
THERE ARE A THOUSAND GUYS
LIKE THIS.
OUCH.
AND IF HE'S ONLY
IN STORES IN LONG ISLAND,
THAT MEANS HE NEVER WENT
TO A TRADE SHOW--
YEAH, WE WENT
TO OUR FIRST TRADE SHOW
ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO
IN SAN DIEGO.
DO YOU HAVE ORDERS?
UM, NO. WE CAME BACK WITH
ZERO ORDERS FROM THE TRADE SHOW.
BUT WE MADE
AMAZING CONTACTS AT--
DAYMOND, ISN'T THAT
A BAD SIGN--ZERO ORDERS?
WELL, IF--
I'M NOT A FASHION GUY, BUT ZERO
ORDERS DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
IN... IT DEPENDS.
WELL, IT'S THE ECONOMY.
IT'S USUALLY HORRIFIC.
IT'S NOT BAD.
FOR RIGHT NOW,
IF THERE'S NOTHING THERE
THAT REALLY LENDS ITSELF
TO M.M.A...
WHAT ABOUT THIS?
BESIDES
THE JAW IDEA ITSELF, UM--
IS HE ONE IN A THOUSAND?
MM. 10,000, MAYBE.
IF YOU GO
TO THE TRADE SHOW,
YOU'RE GONNA SEE VARIOUS AMOUNT
OF BRANDS LIKE THIS,
SO UNLESS HE HAS
HARD PAPER IN SALES
OR SOME OF THE MOST KEY M.M.A.
GUYS WEARING THE PRODUCT--
I CAN--I COULD
GET INTO ALL THAT WITH YOU.
OBVIOUSLY WITH
THE BAD ECONOMY RIGHT NOW,
A LOT OF COMPANIES
DON'T WANT TO RISK
A BRAND-NEW STARTUP COMPANY,
BUT WE HAVE AN ONLINE RETAIL
SHOP THAT WE COULD PURSUE,
AS WELL AS EVERY MAJOR
M.M.A. EVENT,
WE GET OPPORTUNITIES TO SPONSOR
THE MOST TOP-FLIGHT ATHLETES
ON THAT CARD.
CRAIG, THEY'RE ASKING YOU
FOR MONEY.
(Daymond)
YEAH, WE ALL GET THOSE.
YEAH, I MEAN, THAT--I COULD
SPONSOR AN M.M.A EVENT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BRAND
THAT THE KIDS ARE GONNA LIKE
WHEN THE GUY WALKS OUT--
NO, THEY JUST WANT MY MONEY
FOR ADVERTISING.
(Daymond) THEY JUST WANT
OUR MONEY.
SO, CRAIG, I'M GONNA
SUMMARIZE IT FOR ME.
OKAY.
UM, YOU'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB
OF IMPRESSING DAYMOND.
SO IF--IF MR. CLOTHING GUY--
I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW DAYMOND
MY CLOTHING,
BECAUSE HE HASN'T EVEN ASKED
TO SEE IT.
SHOW ME. I-I, YOU KNOW...
DAYMOND, I-I CAME--
BECAUSE I CAME FROM WHERE YOU--
WHERE YOU CAME FROM,
SO I DO NOT WANT TO BE HARSH.
OKAY.
OH, REALLY?
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT--
YOU ASKED ME THE QUESTION.
WHAT ARE YOU LIKE
WHEN YOU'RE HARSH?
DAYMOND, IF YOU'RE NOT
IMPRESSED WITH THIS STUFF,
THEN, YOU KNOW, I--
I REALLY LIKE THAT.
OH, THAT'S COOL.
WE HAVE OUR OWN ZIPPERS--
YOU KNOW, TO BE VERY HONEST,
GUYS AT YOUR LEVEL,
YOU EITHER HAVE TO HAVE
A TALENT ATTACHED TO THE BRAND
OR A RETAILER WHO IS GUARANTEED
TO PUT IT OUT.
WITH YOUR MONEY, DAYMOND,
I COULD GO
AND FLY TO THESE PLACES,
WE COULD HAVE SIT-DOWN MEETINGS.
THIS--THIS DAY AND AGE,
YOU MAIL THIS TO 'EM,
THEY'RE GONNA SEND YOU
THE PAPER,
THEY'RE GONNA
SEND YOU THE ORDERS,
AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT
I WOULD BACK THIS COMPANY.
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD
THE BRAND WITH YOUR MONEY
AND MAKE THIS A BRAND
THAT THEY CAN'T RESIST.
AND I THINK WE HAVE
AN AMAZING BRAND.
WE HAVE BUILT THIS BRAND
NATIONWIDE
IN THREE YEARS
WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY--
I DO THINK THAT
YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING--
ARE YOU LOOKING AT YOURSELF
TEN YEARS AGO?
I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA READ
YOU GUYS A LITTLE SOMETHING
I HAVE
ON ALL OF OUR HANGTAGS.
"THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO ACHIEVE
WHAT I DESIRE MOST.
"PERSEVERANCE WILL ALLOW ME
TO FULFILL MY DREAMS.
NO ONE CAN STOP ME FROM WHAT
I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH."
I WROTE THAT QUOTE.
IT'S ON EVERY HANGTAG
WE GIVE TO OUR PRODUCTS.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE.
I'M MONEY.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.
I JUST WANT TO HAVE MORE MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT THIS SAYS.
ABSOLUTELY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
WITH WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I'M SPEAKING
A LITTLE BIT TO DAYMOND HERE.
THERE'S A MILLION GUYS
OUT THERE LIKE ME.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
A MILLION GUYS LIKE US
THAT HAVE THE PASSION
AND PURSUIT THAT WE HAVE
THAT COME FROM A REAL PLACE.
I'M--I'M LISTENING TO YOU,
AND IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.
I MEAN, I LIKE YOUR,
YOU KNOW--
I WOULD BUY INTO THE BRAND
BECAUSE OF YOU.
BUT THE BRAND ITSELF RIGHT NOW,
IT NEEDS MORE LEGS.
YOU DON'T HAVE ORDERS--
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I NEED TO BUY SWEAT EQUITY THAT
YOU ALREADY HAVE PUT IN THERE.
ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS MANUFACTURED SOMETHING.
I COULD MANUFACTURE IT.
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.
I NEED YOU TO HAVE A FOLLOWING.
WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY, WE'VE
CREATED AN AMAZING FOLLOWING.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WHAT ARE OUR SALES?
THEY'RE VERY INSIGNIFICANT.
VERY INSIGNIFICANT.
LIKE WHAT? LIKE WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SELL?
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR?
WE'VE PROBABLY SOLD
5 GRAND WORTH OF PRODUCT.
(groans)
CRAIG, YOU'RE--YOU'RE--
YOU'RE CRASHING AND BURNING.
I'M OUT.
I'M OUT, TOO.
DAYMOND, ARE YOU GONNA
INVEST IN THIS?
IF YOU'RE IN, I'M FOLLOWING,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT
ALL MY, YOU KNOW--
CRAIG NEEDS DAYMOND
TO TURN THE TIDE.
(Daymond) YOU KNOW,
TO BE VERY HONEST,
AS OF RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE NOBODY TO EVERYBODY.
OKAY.
I'M--I'M...
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
HE'S OUT, I'M OUT.
FOUR SHARKS HAVE BAILED OUT.
KEVIN O'LEARY IS CRAIG'S
LAST CHANCE FOR AN INVESTMENT.
CRAIG, YOU KNOW, LOOK,
I'M JUST AN INVESTOR TRYING TO
SCRATCH OUT A LIVING HERE, OKAY?
I'M LISTENING TO THIS.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOUR STORY--
THE BROKEN JAW,
THE G--THE WINNING GOAL,
ALL THAT STUFF--I LOVE ALL THAT.
BUT YOU GOT
A TOUGH DEAL HERE, BUDDY.
I CAN'T GIVE YOU MY MONEY
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE
HOW I'M GONNA GET IT BACK
WITH MORE OF IT THERE.
IT'S ALL ABOUT INVESTING.
I'M OUT.
BUT I WANT TO BUY
SOME OF THIS STUFF.
THAT'S HOW--HOW CONFLICTED I AM.
WHAT'S THIS THING WORTH?
I'M BUYING THIS RIGHT HERE.
HOW MUCH?
(chuckles) I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE YOUR MONEY.
YOU WON'T TAKE MY MONEY?
THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S--
YOU CAN HAVE IT.
IT'S MY GIFT TO YOU GUYS.
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
CRAIG, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
THANKS, GUYS.
