HI. MY NAME IS MARIAN CRUZ.
MY PRODUCT IS THE TurboBaster.
I'M SEEKING $35,000
FOR INVESTMENT,
COULD WE HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT, MARIAN?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATED COST
ON MANUFACTURING THESE THINGS?
OKAY, I'M THINKING
FASHION KITCHEN COLORS, $19.99,
BUT STAINLESS STEEL MODEL,
$29.99.
BUT, MARIAN, PROVE TO ME
THAT THERE'S A MARKET.
LIKE, HOW DO I KNOW BESIDES
YOUR CHARMING PERSONALITY
TELLING ME THERE'S A MARKET?
RIGHT. BECAUSE IT DOES
MORE THAN ONE THING.
THAT'S IT?
MARIAN, IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN IMPORTANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK YOUR ESTIMATED
MANUFACTURING COSTS ARE?
TO KNOW THAT, ME,
AS AN INVESTOR WHO'S GONNA
GIVE YOU THE $35,000,
COULD FIGURE OUT
IF I'D EVER GET IT BACK?
WHY DID YOU NOT
FIGURE THAT OUT FIRST?
WHY DIDN'T I? BECAUSE...
I'M A NEWBIE,
QUITE HONESTLY.
HOW MANY
OF THE TRADITIONAL ONES
ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES
RIGHT NOW?
YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO IDEA.
(groans)
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW?
IT'S GOTTA BE MILLIONS.
I MEAN, IT'S A BIG BUSINESS.
WHY ARE WE HELPING HER?
THINK ABOUT THIS.
'CAUSE WE LOVE HER.
I LOVE HER.
SHE'S ADORABLE.
I LOVE HER.
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING??
IF YOU WERE IN ONE OF
MY BUSINESS SCHOOL CLASSES...
YOU BETTER STOP
BEING MEAN TO HER.
I WOULD SPRAY YOU DOWN
WITH WATER,
SO, MARIAN,
YOU HAVE NO PRODUCT,
YOU HAVE A PROTOTYPE,
YOU HAVE NO SALES,
YOU'RE NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT FOR
MARIAN,
YOU'RE A NICE ENOUGH PERSON.
YOU'RE CUTE, YOU'RE BUBBLY,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY OF YOUR NUMBERS.
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL ME
IF I COULD EVER MAKE A PROFIT
ON THIS BASTER.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
(Barbara) MARIAN...
I CAN'T IMAGINE INVESTING
IN A BUSINESS
WHERE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S
GONNA COST YOU TO PRODUCE IT.
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
MARIAN, I'VE CUT YOU WAY MORE
SLACK THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
BUT EVENTUALLY,
I GOTTA KNOW THE NUMBERS.
YOU HAVE NO NUMBERS.
I'M OUT.
I LIKE THE FUNCTIONALITY
OF THIS PRODUCT.
I DO A LOT OF BUSINESS ON TV,
SHOPPING CHANNELS, ETCETERA.
I BELIEVE THERE'S A MARKET
FOR THIS PRODUCT. I LIKE IT.
I'D PUT UP THE $35,000.
MY INTEREST WOULD BE
IN A LICENSING DEAL.
I WILL CONTROL THE DEAL,
BUT I'LL PAY YOU A ROYALTY THEN.
BUT, MARIAN, HE'S A SHARK,
AS NICE A GUY AS HE'S ACTING.
YOU BETTER ASK HIM
WHAT THE ROYALTY IS.
WHAT IS THE ROYALTY?
WANT ME TO LEND YOU
MY ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD?
(Barbara chuckles)
LISTEN, YOU HAVE NOTHING.
TAKE HIS OFFER. THIS GUY
IS THROWING YOU A LIFELINE.
