MY NAME IS LORI LITE, AND I LIVE
IN MARIETTA, GEORGIA.
(laughs)
MY HUSBAND RICK AND I
HAVE THREE CHILDREN,
AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEM.
RAISING CHILDREN
IS REALLY STRESSFUL,
AND MY SON MADE MATTERS
EVEN WORSE
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T PUT HIM
TO BED AT NIGHT.
THE STRESS GOT SO BAD
THAT MY AUNT FORCED ME
TO GO TO
STRESS MANAGEMENT CLASSES...
(inhales and exhales deeply)
SO THAT I COULD LEARN
RELAXATION TECHNIQUES.
ONE NIGHT WHILE I WAS
PUTTING MY SON TO SLEEP,
I USED THE SAME TECHNIQUES
ON MY SON.
MY HUSBAND WAS
STANDING IN THE HALLWAY
LISTENING TO THE WHOLE THING.
WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE ROOM,
HE HUGGED ME,
AND HE SAID,
"LORI, THAT WAS GREAT.
YOU CAN HELP THOUSANDS
OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS."
AND BASICALLY,
IT INSPIRED A WHOLE BUSINESS.
BUT WHAT I DO TAKES MONEY??
UP?FRONT MONEY??
AND WE'RE ALWAYS GOING
FROM??FROM DOLLAR TO DOLLAR,
HAND TO MOUTH, AND WE'VE
PUT EVERYTHING ON THE LINE.
I MEAN,
MY HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET.
UM, WE'RE SHARING ONE CAR NOW.
I DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.
I KNOW I HAVE AN EFFECTIVE
PRODUCT, BUT I NEED HELP
TO GET THIS OUT INTO
EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA.
PARENTS NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT MY PRODUCT,
AND THE SHARKS
CAN HELP ME DO THAT.
HI. I'M LORI LITE,
AND THE NAME OF MY COMPANY
IS STRESS FREE KIDS.
I'M ASKING YOU TO INVEST
$250,000 IN MY COMPANY
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20%.
I'M A HANDS?ON MOM
THAT HAS DEALT
WITH REAL STRESS AND ANXIETY
WHILE RAISING MY THREE CHILDREN.
MY SON WAS HYPERACTIVE.
EVERY NIGHT, IT TOOK ME
TWO HOURS TO PUT HIM TO BED.
LUCKILY FOR ME,
I LEARNED TO DO
STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES
THAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT
ON ME.
I WONDERED,
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE
IF I COULD GET MY <i>SON</i>
TO DO THE SAME TECHNIQUES?
I BEGAN TO CREATE A STORY
THAT ENTERTAINED HIM,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
INCORPORATED AN ACTUAL
STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE.
TO MY AMAZEMENT, MY SON FOLLOWED
ALONG AND FELL ASLEEP.
NOW I HAVE A WHOLE LINE
OF BOOKS AND CDs
THAT HELP CHILDREN
MANAGE STRESS
WHILE PROMOTING
THEIR SELF?ESTEEM
AND A MORE PEACEFUL SLEEP.
CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE,
A QUICK PARAGRAPH
OR SOMETHING?
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
SITTING UP HERE...
I CAN.
WITH THESE PEOPLE??
A LOT OF STRESS.
AND, LORI, WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO READ TO US,
DID YOU WRITE THAT YOURSELF?
YES. I NOT ONLY WROTE,
BUT I PRODUCED AND I PUBLISHED.
WOW.
OKAY, THIS IS "ANGRY OCTOPUS."
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF USING
PROGRESSIVE MUSCULAR RELAXATION.
"AND THE SEA CHILD CONTINUED.
"'TIGHTEN THE MUSCLES
IN YOUR CHEST,
'YOUR NECK AND YOUR SHOULDERS."
COME ON, GUYS. DO IT.
"'TIGHTEN THEM AS TIGHT
AS YOU CAN. HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.'"
AHH!
AHH!
"NOW LET THE AIR
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH
"AND FEEL ALL THE TENSION
IN YOUR CHEST,
NECK AND SHOULDERS
DRIFT AWAY."
IT'S VERY GOOD.
YEAH, THE WORDS ARE VERY,
UH, VERY SOOTHING.
THANK YOU.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU MADE
IN SALES OF THIS STUFF?
UH, WELL, LAST YEAR
I MOVED 30,000 UNITS AND...
(O'Leary) WOW.
WHOA.
30,000 UNITS?
YES.
OUT OF YOUR HOME?
OUT OF YOUR KITCHEN?
OUT OF MY KITCHEN.
SO, LORI, ON THE 30,000 UNITS
YOU SOLD LAST YEAR...
YES.
WHAT WAS THE TOTAL SALES?
$180,000 IN REVENUES.
ON THAT $180,000, HOW MUCH DID
YOU MAKE? HOW MUCH WAS LEFT??
$50,000 IN PROFIT.
WOW.
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.
IS HE IN ON THIS WITH YOU?
WHAT'S HIS ROLE?
OH, YES. WELL, YOU KNOW,
BASICALLY,
I MADE HIM QUIT HIS JOB.
WHOA.
HE HELPS WITH SALES
AND MARKETING AND??
SO THE $50,000
THAT YOU MADE PROFIT
WAS BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND BOTH?
WELL, YES. WE'RE MARRIED
FOR 23 YEARS. WE??WE SHARE.
IS THERE REAL PROOF OUT THERE
THAT CHILDREN <i>ARE</i> FEELING
THIS KIND OF STRESS,
THAT THERE'S A REAL MARKET
FOR THAT?
THERE IS.
I THINK IT'S 13 OUT OF A HUNDRED
CHILDREN HAVE ANXIETY DISORDERS.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE
TO A CHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHER
AND SAY, "LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE.
I'VE SOLD 30,000 OF THESE.
GIVE ME A DEAL.
I'M A GREAT AUTHOR"?
BECAUSE HONESTLY, MY FIRST TWO
BOOKS WERE WITH A PUBLISHER.
AND THEN AFTER THAT,
I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO DO
MY OWN PUBLISHING.
WHY?
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK
WITH THE PUBLISHER?
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK
THE OTHER WAY?
UM, WELL, YOU GET PAID
A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE.
BUT YOU SELL A LOT OF BOOKS.
NO, I SELL MORE BOOKS
BY MYSELF.
(O'Leary) WHY DIDN'T YOU SELL
A LOT THROUGH THE PUBLISHER?
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WENT WRONG THERE?
WELL, UM, THEY DON'T REALLY??
THEY DON'T PROMOTE YOU
UNLESS YOU'RE A KNOWN NAME.
LORI, HOW MUCH OF YOUR
PERSONAL MONEY IS IN THIS?
$200,000.
ALL OF THE MODELS
OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS
AND CHILDREN'S PUBLISHING,
THE ONLY WAY YOU MAKE MONEY
IN THAT BUSINESS
IS YOU GET MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION.
THERE ARE TWO GIANT RETAILERS
THAT CONTROL
THE PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION
AND ONE ONLINE ONE.
AND UNTIL YOU HAVE
ALL THREE OF THOSE...
AMAZON IS??IS MY BIGGEST.
(O'Leary) YES. BORDERS?
UH, BORDERS, BARNES &amp; NOBLE.
YES, I'M ON OR I'M IN
ALL OF THOSE PLACES.
YOU HAVE ALL THE DISTRIBUTION.
(O'Leary) BUT THEN WHY
AREN'T THE SALES MORE?
OKAY, BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND??
WELL, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO WITH MY MONEY?
I MEAN, BUT THIS IS??
I?I?I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU ARE NOT APPRECIATING
WHAT I'VE DONE.
I VERY MUCH??
(Robert) NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE ARE APPRECIATING IT. IT LOOKS
LIKE A POT OF GOLD RIGHT NOW,
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING??
THIS IS A POT OF GOLD.
THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING.
WHERE YOU'RE LOSING ME IS,
YOU'RE IN
EVERY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL
YOU COULD POSSIBLY BE IN.
YES.
I GIVE YOU $250,000...
YES.
HOW DO AMAZON SALES GO UP?
UM, THERE ARE??THERE ARE THINGS
I COULD DO ON AMAZON
TO PR??TO PROMOTE, ADVERTISING
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL PROMOTE.
BUT, LORI, YOU'RE MAKING,
UH, ABOUT $50,000 A YEAR.
CORRECT.
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A BAD ECONOMY OUT THERE.
I KNOW.
BASED ON YOUR OFFER
OF $250,000 FOR 20%,
YOU'RE SAYING YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH OVER $1 MILLION TODAY.
CORRECT.
BUT IT'S ONLY EARNING
$50,000.
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE GAP.
WELL, I WAS BASING??I'M BASING
THAT BASED ON MY REVENUES,
YOU KNOW, THAT I'M MAKING.
BUT YOUR REVENUES ARE $180,000.
BUT I BELIEVE??YOU KNOW,
SOME OF THIS COMES FROM BELIEF.
YOU KNOW?
WHAT I WAS HOPING
YOU WERE GONNA SAY
WAS THAT THE REASON
YOU'RE NOT SELLING MORE
IS 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
FUND INVENTORY.
OKAY.
I THINK, UH, YOUR VALUATION
IS SO CRAZY OUT THERE.
SO I'M OUT.
WELL, JUST??
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
I'LL MAKE IT EASY FROM MY SIDE.
I SEE TEN PRODUCTS HERE.
I LIKE TO FOCUS ON ONE ITEM THAT
I CAN SELL A MILLION PIECES.
SO I'M OUT.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
$250,000 FOR 100%
OF YOUR COMPANY.
(laughs)
THAT'S IT.
NO. NO.
I'M OUT.
I THINK THAT YOU ARE A STAR.
OH, THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
I NEEDED A MOMENT
OF A COMPLIMENT. THANK YOU.
I THINK THAT
THAT IS A BRAND.
(whispers) THANK YOU.
I WILL OFFER YOU...
$250,000...
FOR 51%
OF YOUR COMPANY.
51%?
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
THE SAME DEAL, BUT JUST FOR 50%.
50%?
FOR 50 VERSUS 51.
NOW YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN 50% AND 51% IS...
YES.
THAT WE DECIDE TOGETHER
WHAT WE DO.
WITH DAYMOND, HE WOULD MAKE
ALL THE DECISIONS.
HE'D HAVE THE FINAL CALL.
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK
THIS BUSINESS IS WORTH??
BUT DAYMOND WILL END UP HAVING
A CLOTHING COMPANY OUT OF IT,
A BEDDING COMPANY OUT OF IT,
POTS AND PANS.
WE'LL BE COOKING
ON AN "ANGRY OCTOPUS"??
POTS AND PANS?
YEAH,
"ANGRY OCTOPUS" TOASTERS.
I'M GONNA MAKE HER A BRAND.
I'M GONNA MAKE HER A STAR.
I WANT THE DEAL, BARBARA.
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
THESE PEOPLE ARE OFFERING YOU??
TEN TIMES VALUATION
IS A VERY, VERY GOOD OFFER
THAT YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT.
AND I ALSO THINK??
AS A HUSBAND OF 19 YEARS??
YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR HUSBAND
AND ASK HIM WHAT HE THINKS.
I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT.
ALL RIGHT. MAKE THAT CALL.
I'LL BE BACK.
