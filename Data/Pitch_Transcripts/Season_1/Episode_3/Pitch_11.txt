HI. I'M LORI LITE,
OUT OF MY KITCHEN.
SO, LORI, ON THE 30,000 UNITS
YOU SOLD LAST YEAR...
YES.
WHAT WAS THE TOTAL SALES?
$180,000 IN REVENUES.
ON THAT $180,000, HOW MUCH DID
YOU MAKE? HOW MUCH WAS LEFT??
$50,000 IN PROFIT.
UNLESS YOU'RE A KNOWN NAME.
LORI, HOW MUCH OF YOUR
PERSONAL MONEY IS IN THIS?
$200,000.
ALL OF THE MODELS
BUT, LORI, YOU'RE MAKING,
UH, ABOUT $50,000 A YEAR.
CORRECT.
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A BAD ECONOMY OUT THERE.
I KNOW.
BASED ON YOUR OFFER
OF $250,000 FOR 20%,
YOU'RE SAYING YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH OVER $1 MILLION TODAY.
CORRECT.
BUT IT'S ONLY EARNING
$50,000.
