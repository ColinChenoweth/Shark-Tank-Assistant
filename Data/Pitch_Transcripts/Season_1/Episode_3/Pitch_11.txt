HI. MY NAME IS MARIAN CRUZ.
MY PRODUCT IS THE TurboBaster.
I'M SEEKING $35,000
FOR INVESTMENT,
AND I'M WILLING TO GIVE UP
30% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
I FIRST CAME WITH THIS CONCEPT
ONE THANKSGIVING DAY
WHEN I WAS COOKING DINNER
FOR MY FAMILY.
I WAS USING
A TRADITIONAL BULB BASTER.
(liquid gurgles)
IT WAS INEFFICIENT. IT WASN'T
EVEN HOLDING ANY OF THE FLUIDS.
IT SPLATTERED ALL OVER ME.
AND I THOUGHT,
"THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY."
SO I DEVELOPED THE TurboBaster.
IT'S GONNA REPLACE
THE TRADITIONAL BULB BASTER,
THE BASTING BRUSH.
IT'S ALSO GONNA REPLACE
THE INJECTOR MARINADE AS WELL.
SO I CREATED THE TurboBaster.
(Robert) WHOO! (laughs)
THE TurboBaster IS GONNA BE
BATTERY?OPERATED.
IT'S GONNA SIPHON UP THE JUICES
MORE EFFICIENTLY.
IT'S ALSO COME
WITH A SILICONE BASTING BRUSH
SO YOU COULD BASTE YOUR FOODS
AND VEGETABLES MORE EFFICIENTLY.
IT'S ALSO GONNA COME
WITH AN INJECTOR TIP
TO INJECT
YOUR FAVORITE MARINADES.
THAT WAS AMAZING. IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE BUILDING A ROCKET.
(laughs)
(chuckles)
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
FOR FIVE YEARS,
AND I THINK THAT ANYONE
THAT LOVES TO COOK WILL NEED
TO HAVE THE TurboBaster
IN THEIR KITCHEN.
I GOT A QUESTION.
CAN YOU
ALSO USE THE SAME SYRINGE
TO BE A TEMPERATURE GAUGE
AS WELL?
DAYMOND, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
IN YOUR KITCHEN.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
THE KITCHEN IN YOUR HOUSE IS.
(sharks laugh)
YOU COULD BASTE YOUR HAIR
WITH MOUSSE.
WE COULD MAKE A SALE HERE, TOO.
HOW DO YOU CLEAN THAT?
WELL, IT'S GONNA COME APART
FOR EASY CLEANING.
CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE THAT HERE?
WELL, THIS IS
A NONWORKING PROTOTYPE.
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE ONE YET.
NO.
OH, YOU HAVEN'T BUILT IT.
NO, BECAUSE??
YOU BUILT A GREAT VIDEO.
COULD WE HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT, MARIAN?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATED COST
ON MANUFACTURING THESE THINGS?
OKAY, I'M THINKING
FASHION KITCHEN COLORS, $19.99,
BUT STAINLESS STEEL MODEL,
$29.99.
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE THEM FOR, DO YOU THINK?
I HAVE NO IDEA. I HAVEN'T DONE
THAT PART OF THE RESEARCH.
OOH.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
OUT THERE LIKE THIS?
NO.
BUT, MARIAN, PROVE TO ME
THAT THERE'S A MARKET.
LIKE, HOW DO I KNOW BESIDES
YOUR CHARMING PERSONALITY
TELLING ME THERE'S A MARKET?
RIGHT. BECAUSE IT DOES
MORE THAN ONE THING.
THAT'S IT?
MARIAN, IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN IMPORTANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK YOUR ESTIMATED
MANUFACTURING COSTS ARE?
TO KNOW THAT, ME,
AS AN INVESTOR WHO'S GONNA
GIVE YOU THE $35,000,
COULD FIGURE OUT
IF I'D EVER GET IT BACK?
WHY DID YOU NOT
FIGURE THAT OUT FIRST?
WHY DIDN'T I? BECAUSE...
I'M A NEWBIE,
QUITE HONESTLY.
HOW MANY
OF THE TRADITIONAL ONES
ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES
RIGHT NOW?
YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO IDEA.
(groans)
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW?
IT'S GOTTA BE MILLIONS.
I MEAN, IT'S A BIG BUSINESS.
WHY ARE WE HELPING HER?
THINK ABOUT THIS.
'CAUSE WE LOVE HER.
I LOVE HER.
SHE'S ADORABLE.
I LOVE HER.
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING??
IF YOU WERE IN ONE OF
MY BUSINESS SCHOOL CLASSES...
YOU BETTER STOP
BEING MEAN TO HER.
I WOULD SPRAY YOU DOWN
WITH WATER,
AND EVERY TIME YOU'D SAY
"I DON'T KNOW,"
I'D HIT YOU
WITH AN ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.
(sharks chuckle)
I MEAN,
YOU GOTTA KNOW THIS STUFF.
SO, MARIAN,
YOU HAVE NO PRODUCT,
YOU HAVE A PROTOTYPE,
YOU HAVE NO SALES,
YOU'RE NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT FOR
AND YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR COSTS,
BUT YET, WE LOVE YOU,
AND WE'RE ENJOYING
HAVING YOU HERE.
YOU KNOW...
IT GOES TO PROVE THAT BEING NICE
GOES A LONG WAY.
IT GOES TO PROVE THAT THE BRAND
STARTS WITH THE PERSON.
(Barbara) WELL SAID.
ABSOLUTELY.
WE INVEST IN THE PERSON.
BUT ANYBODY ELSE OUT HERE, YOU
WOULD HAVE BEEN EATEN ALIVE.
WELL, WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET.
MARIAN,
YOU'RE A NICE ENOUGH PERSON.
YOU'RE CUTE, YOU'RE BUBBLY,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY OF YOUR NUMBERS.
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL ME
IF I COULD EVER MAKE A PROFIT
ON THIS BASTER.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
(Barbara) MARIAN...
I CAN'T IMAGINE INVESTING
IN A BUSINESS
WHERE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S
GONNA COST YOU TO PRODUCE IT.
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
MARIAN, I'VE CUT YOU WAY MORE
SLACK THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
BUT EVENTUALLY,
I GOTTA KNOW THE NUMBERS.
YOU HAVE NO NUMBERS.
I'M OUT.
I LIKE THE FUNCTIONALITY
OF THIS PRODUCT.
I DO A LOT OF BUSINESS ON TV,
SHOPPING CHANNELS, ETCETERA.
I BELIEVE THERE'S A MARKET
FOR THIS PRODUCT. I LIKE IT.
I'D PUT UP THE $35,000.
MY INTEREST WOULD BE
IN A LICENSING DEAL.
I WILL CONTROL THE DEAL,
BUT I'LL PAY YOU A ROYALTY THEN.
BUT, MARIAN, HE'S A SHARK,
AS NICE A GUY AS HE'S ACTING.
YOU BETTER ASK HIM
WHAT THE ROYALTY IS.
WHAT IS THE ROYALTY?
WANT ME TO LEND YOU
MY ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD?
(Barbara chuckles)
LISTEN, YOU HAVE NOTHING.
TAKE HIS OFFER. THIS GUY
IS THROWING YOU A LIFELINE.
WHATEVER THE ROYALTY IS,
YOU TAKE IT AND STOP WHINING.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A FAIR DEAL.
IT WOULD PAY YOU 2% OF SALES,
I'LL PUT UP ALL THE MONEY,
I'LL PAY YOU A ROYALTY,
AND YOU'RE GONNA BRING
TurboBaster TO THE MARKETPLACE,
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO DO FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU LIKE MY OFFER?
I DO.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
I WANT THE TurboBaster
OUT IN THE WORLD.
I WANT IT IN EVERY KITCHEN.
SO RUN OVER AND HUG HIM
AND TAKE HIS OFFER.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. HEY.
OH!
(Harrington) HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS MY DEAL.
I WANT??
WHAT ARE WE ALL UP HERE FOR?
I WANT 51% OF THE COMPANY
FOR $40,000...
AND 2% ROYALTY OFF THE TOP.
THIS WAY, YOU HAVE A PARTNER
WHO WILL BUILD A BIGGER BRAND.
WE WILL DO MORE THINGS
THAN THE TurboBaster.
MORE PRODUCTS
WILL ROLL OUT AFTERWARDS.
AS WELL AS,
I'M A MANUFACTURER,
SO I KNOW HOW TO WORK OVERSEAS
AND GET THINGS TOOLED
AND MADE MORE QUICKLY.
LOOK, DAYMOND,
I HAVE TO JUST SAY,
I'VE SOLD MILLIONS OF KITCHEN
PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS.
I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT JEANS, OKAY...
(laughs)
BUT I DON'T KNOW
THAT??THAT??THAT MR. DAYMOND
HAS DONE KITCHEN PRODUCTS.
I REALLY DON'T CARE
BECAUSE I WANT THE DEAL.
SO YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
BABY?
THERE'S ONLY ONE DECISION
YOU CAN MAKE RIGHT NOW.
IF THIS WAS A PAIR OF JEANS,
I'D GO TO DAYMOND.
FOR KITCHEN PRODUCT,
I'M YOUR MAN.
I'M GONNA RAISE IT TO $50,000.
(laughs) OH, DEAR LORD.
FOR 51%.
WOW. THAT'S HUGE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I JUST HAVE TO GO WHERE
MY PRODUCT IS GONNA DO BEST.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE
BESIDES GIVING BIRTH
TO MY KIDS. (laughs)
