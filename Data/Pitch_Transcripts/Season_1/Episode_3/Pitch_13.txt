FINISHED AS A PROTOTYPE.
YOU KNOW, THE BUSINESS
ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.
IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING YET
TILL IT GETS INTO,

BUT FOR THAT REASON,
I DON'T SEE AN OPPORTUNITY

TOO MUCH RISK FOR ME,
SO I'M SORRY, BUT I'M OUT.
I THINK YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER
CAREER IN BEING A DESIGNER.
I LIKE THAT OUTFIT...
