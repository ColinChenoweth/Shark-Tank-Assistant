MY NAME IS BRYAN PARKS.
I LIVE IN EUGENE, OREGON,
AND I AM AN ARTIST,
AN ENVIRONMENTALIST
AND AN ENTREPRENEUR.
LIVING IN EUGENE
REALLY MAKES ME STAY TRUE
TO MY GOALS OF BEING
A REALLY ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANY,
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HERE
AND EVERYTHING IS SO GREEN.
IT'S KIND OF KNOWN
AS KIND OF A HIPPIE PLACE.
HEY, XIAO GU.
I WAS LIVING IN CHINA
SIX YEARS AGO,
AND I BECAME AWARE
OF A VALUABLE RESOURCE
THAT WAS GOING TO WASTE.
GREEN PRODUCTS ARE HOT. I HAVE
A PRODUCT THAT'S 100% RECYCLED.
AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SHARKS
WOULD BE GREAT FOR THEM
BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL
THEY COULD MAKE MONEY,
BUT I THINK IT WOULD ALSO HAVE
A REALLY POSITIVE IMPACT
ON THE ENVIRONMENT.
MY NAME IS BRYAN PARKS. MY
COMPANY IS CALLED CHOPSTICK ART.
I'M ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR 10% OF THE COMPANY.
SO YOU GUYS ALL KNOW
WHAT THESE ARE, I'M SURE.
WE PULL THEM APART,
WE EAT A DELICIOUS ASIAN MEAL
AND THEN WE TOSS THEM OUT.
BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
AFTER THAT?
WELL, ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO,
I WAS LIVING IN CHINA
AND ONE DAY A FRIEND AND I
WERE EATING LUNCH.
OF COURSE WE WERE USING
CHOPSTICKS.
AND WE STARTED TO GUESS
THE NUMBER OF THESE THINGS
THAT ARE ACTUALLY THROWN OUT
EACH YEAR.
AFTER SOME RESEARCH,
WE FOUND THAT THE NUMBER
WAS AROUND 25 BILLION PAIRS.
25 BILLION PAIRS
OF THESE THINGS
WERE GOING STRAIGHT
TO THE DUMP, AND NOBODY WAS
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS FREE
AND VALUABLE RESOURCE.
AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT THAT THIS
WOULD BE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO COMBINE MY PASSION
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
AND FEED
MY ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT.
SO I CREATED CHOPSTICK ART.
(man) DA?DUM.
TA?DA! (chuckles)
SO HERE ARE A FEW
OF THE PRODUCTS
THAT I HAVE DESIGNED SO FAR,
ALL MADE WITH
RECYCLED BAMBOO CHOPSTICKS.
AND EVERYONE OF THOSE STICKS
HAS BEEN IN SOMEONE ELSE'S
MOUTH, RIGHT?
THAT'S CORRECT,
BUT, OF COURSE, THEY'RE ALL
CLEANED AND SANITIZED,
AND AS FAR AS I KNOW,
NOBODY'S GONNA BE LICKING THEIR,
UH, LAMPS OR THEIR WINE RACK.
(laughs)
UM, MY BEST?SELLING PRODUCT
RIGHT NOW ARE THESE BASKETS.
THEY KEEP FRUIT REALLY FRESH,
UH, BECAUSE OF
GOOD AIR CIRCULATION.
BRYAN, TELL US
WHAT EACH OF THEM SELL FOR.
THEY WOULD GO FOR ABOUT $7,
$12, $22 AND $30.
SO THAT THING'S 30 BUCKS, THAT
YOU'RE HOLDING IN YOUR HAND?
YEAH. THERE'S MORE.
THESE BASKETS??
THEY FOLD UP FLAT, SO??
OH, THAT'S COOL.
ISN'T THAT COOL?
(Robert) YEAH, THAT IS COOL.
(Harrington) HMM. VERY NICE.
SO THEY'RE EASY TO STORE.
(Robert) BRYAN, CAN I SEE IT?
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU.
BRYAN, WHAT'S
THAT THING AT THE END?
OH, THIS IS A NECKLACE.
DO YOU WEAR IT?
I DO, SOMETIMES. IT DIDN'T
GO WITH MY ORANGE TODAY.
(Harrington laughs)
(Daymond)
WHERE??WHERE HAVE YOU SOLD TO?
SINCE I STARTED ABOUT
FIVE YEARS AGO,
I'VE DONE ABOUT
A HALF MILLION IN SALES. UM...
WHOA.
IT WASN'T UNTIL I GOT
THE FOLDING BASKETS
THAT I REALLY STARTED
MAKING A PROFIT.
AND THEN HOW MUCH DID YOU NET?
UH, ABOUT $45,000.
YOU MUST HAVE PUT
A LOT OF YOUR OWN CASH,
'CAUSE I'M JUST LISTENING
TO YOUR NUMBERS...
OF COURSE I DID.
OF COURSE I DID.
OKAY, SO HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU PUT IN?
I PUT??I PUT IN
ABOUT $100,000.
OF YOUR OWN MONEY?
OF MY OWN MONEY.
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT MONEY?
UH, WELL, FROM MY GOOD FRIENDS
VISA AND AMEX.
(sharks laugh)
(Robert) SO YOU USED
CREDIT CARDS?
YOU'RE ASKING FOR 10% OF YOUR
BUSINESS IF I GIVE YOU $100,000.
THAT'S RIGHT.
SO I MULTIPLY THAT TIMES TEN,
AND IT TELLS ME
YOU THINK YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH $1 MILLION.
I?I DO. THE AMOUNT OF SALES
I'VE??I'M DOING RIGHT NOW??
I'VE SAID $300,000??
THAT'S WITH VERY LITTLE
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING.
WHY WOULD I, AS AN INVESTOR,
GIVE YOU $100,000?
LIKE, HOW WOULD I
EVER GET MY MONEY BACK?
OKAY, WELL,
LET'S BE STRAIGHT HERE.
YOU GUYS KNOW IT
AND I KNOW IT??
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T
AN INVESTMENT
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA ADD MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS TO YOUR PORTFOLIO,
BUT THIS IS A SAFE INVESTMENT
THAT YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT.
BRYAN, I LOOK
AT A LOT OF PRODUCTS, OKAY?
THIS IS NOT
A GOTTA?HAVE TYPE PRODUCT.
THIS IS "IT'S NICE TO HAVE."
I'M OUT.
BRYAN, YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.
THIS IS NOT
A $100?MILLION IDEA.
RIGHT.
I?I THINK THIS IS
A SMALL BUSINESS. I'M OUT.
THE PROBLEM IS, IT ONLY MAKES
$45,000 AS A COMPANY.
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
(chuckles)
I, UM, I LIKE THE PRODUCT,
BUT IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR ME,
SO I'M OUT.
RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING HERE.
THESE ARE SHARK?INFESTED WATERS.
YOU WOULD GET SOMEBODY
AS YOUR PARTNER HERE
AND BE MISERABLE.
I'M OUT.
JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH, BRYAN.
BUT YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
GREAT JOB.
AND, BRYAN, C?CAN I H??CAN I
HAVE THE BASKET FOR MY WIFE?
(Bryan) YOU CAN.
THANK YOU, BRYAN.
APPRECIATE IT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
GOOD LUCK MAKING
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
AND CATCH YOU LATER.
THANKS. HE WAS A NICE GUY.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
NICE? HE'S BEYOND NICE.
HE'S A SWEETIE PIE. WHEW.
AND HE'S MAKING A LIVING.
I WANT YOU
TO INVITE ME OVER FOR DINNER
WHEN YOU GIVE THAT BASKET
TO YOUR WIFE,
AND I'M GONNA TELL HER
WHERE THOSE STICKS WERE.
(sharks laugh)
UH, I'M A LITTLE BUMMED OUT.
I?I THOUGHT THEY WOULD SEE MORE
VALUE IN IT THAN THEY DID.
