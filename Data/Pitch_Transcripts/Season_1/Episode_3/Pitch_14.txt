I'M JEFF COHEN,
AND MY SON JOSH AND I HAVE
THE MOST UNIQUE MUSICAL PRODUCT
TO HIT THE MARKET
IN MANY, MANY YEARS.
(playing guitar chords)
I LOVE MUSIC. JOSH LOVES MUSIC,
AND HE'S A GREAT MUSICIAN.
WORKING WITH THIS COMPANY
HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC BONDING
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TWO OF US.
IN FACT, I?I REALLY CAN THANK
THIS COMPANY
FOR FOSTERING JUST A??
JUST A FABULOUS
FATHER/SON RELATIONSHIP.
THAT'S IT.
I'VE INVESTED A LOT OF TIME,
A LOT OF MONEY
AND MY PERSONAL REPUTATION
IN THIS COMPANY.
AND I'M AFRAID THAT
IF I DON'T GET THIS FINANCING
IN PLACE QUICKLY,
THAT ALL MIGHT BE WASTED.
(slaps Josh's back)
HI, I'M JEFF COHEN, C. E. O.
OF VOYAGE AIR GUITAR.
I'M HERE WITH MY SON JOSH.
HI.
AND WE'RE RAISING $500,000
IN THIS ROUND OF FINANCING
FOR 5% OF THE COMPANY.
WOW.
(coughs)
OH! WHOA!
OH, EXCUSE ME.
I??SOMETHING HIT ME THERE.
WELL,
THE PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE
IS AN INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE
GUITAR.
IN FACT, I THINK YOU COULD SAY
IT'S THE MOST INNOVATIVE GUITAR
IN A CENTURY
OF GUITAR BUILDING.
NOT ONLY DO THESE GUITARS
LOOK INCREDIBLE...
(playing guitar chords)
WHOO!
THEY SOUND INCREDIBLE.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THEY DO.
THEY DON'T JUST LOOK GOOD.
THEY DON'T JUST SOUND GOOD...
THEY FOLD IN HALF.
THEY FOLD IN HALF SO THAT
YOU NEVER HAVE TO TRAVEL AGAIN
WITHOUT YOUR GUITAR.
WHAT MAKES THIS WORK
IS THIS PATENTED HINGE.
AND NOT ONLY
IS THE HINGE PATENTED,
WHEN WE BUILT THIS GUITAR,
WE HAD TO TOTALLY CHANGE
THE WAY A GUITAR HAS BEEN MADE
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
NOW THE GUITAR IS DESIGNED
TO FIT NEATLY IN A BACKPACK,
TO FIT SAFELY IN THE OVERHEAD
COMPARTMENT ON AN AIRLINE.
IT'S DESIGNED
SO YOU COULD THROW
A HALF A DOZEN OF 'EM
IN THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR.
YOU COULD RIDE YOUR BIKE
WITH IT.
YOU COULD TAKE A WALK WITH IT.
EASILY FITS ON YOUR BACK.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE YOUR GUITAR
WITH YOU.
BRING THAT OVER HERE.
I WANT TO DO IT.
I WANT TO SEE
IF IT STAYS IN TUNE
OR I HAVE TO RETUNE THE WHOLE
THING EVERY TIME I DO THAT.
(Josh speaks indistinctly)
'CAUSE TO ME,
THAT WOULD BE A BIG HASSLE.
SO GRAB THE NECK.
YEAH.
THERE YOU GO.
AND TAKE THE BODY??
YEAH.
TAKE THE BODY. PUT IT UNDER
YOUR ARMPIT AS SO.
YEAH.
JUST PUSH AND TWIST.
OH, I LIKE
THAT LITTLE SNAP THING.
YEAH. AND, UH...
OKAY. IT WAS IN TUNE, SO LET'S
SEE IF IT'S IN TUNE RIGHT NOW.
'CAUSE I BET
IT'S NOT GONNA BE IN TUNE.
(Jeff) FOR HOW MUCH?
(strumming chords)
SOUNDS THE SAME.
OKAY, I WILL ADMIT,
THIS THING STAYED IN TUNE.
I'D BUY IT.
(Robert) JEFF, IS IT PATENTED?
DO YOU OWN THE PATENT
TO THE NECK HINGE THING?
YES.
(Barbara) YES.
(Robert) DO YOU HAVE SALES?
WE LAUNCHED
IN JANUARY/FEBRUARY.
WE'VE SOLD ABOUT??
WELL, WE'VE SOLD
ALL THE UNITS WE'VE BUILT,
ABOUT 800 UNITS.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GENERATING
A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT
OF REVENUE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
BUILDING THEM FAST ENOUGH.
WHAT WE WANT
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR
IS TO BUILD OUT THE INVENTORY.
WHAT DID THE 800 UNITS CREATE
IN REVENUE?
800 UNITS AT, UH,
WHOLESALE PRICE IS ONLY $500.
THAT'S ABOUT $400,000.
SO YOU HAVE SALES OF $400,000?
HOW MUCH OF THAT
WAS PROFITABLE?
OH, WE'RE??WE'RE
CASH FLOW NEGATIVE.
SO, JEFF, IF YOU'RE ASKING
FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS...
MM?HMM.
FOR 5% OF YOUR BUSINESS...
CORRECT.
WHICH MAKES THE OVERALL BUSINESS
WORTH $10 MILLION.
YES. YES.
(O'Leary) AND YOU'VE ONLY SOLD
$400,000 WORTH OF GUITARS.
RIGHT.
DO YOU SEE ANY
PROBLEM WITH THAT?
I?I SEE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
I THINK??
I SEE GREED. I SEE GREED.
WELL, THIS IS A PRODUCT
THAT HAS A 50% GROSS MARGIN.
THERE ARE
3 MILLION GUITARS SOLD
JUST IN THE UNITED STATES
EVERY YEAR,
AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO REASON WHY ANYBODY
THAT BUYS A GUITAR TODAY
WOULDN'T WANT THE FLEXIBILITY
TO BE ABLE TO FOLD IT IN HALF
AND TAKE IT WITH THEM.
LET ME ASK
A REALLY SIMPLE QUESTION
BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER.
I KNOW I LOOK LIKE A HIP
ROCK STAR??I REALIZE THAT??
BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T PLAY
THE GUITAR.
IF THE HINGE IS UNIQUE
AND PATENTED...
MM?HMM. YEP.
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE
THAT MAKE GUITARS ALREADY.
RIGHT.
WHY NOT LICENSE
THE HINGE IDEA TO THEM,
SIT AT HOME,
COLLECT THE ROYALTY,
WHICH MEANS
THEY JUST SEND YOU THE MONEY
EVERY TIME THEY SELL ONE??
WELL??
(O'Leary) WHY AREN'T YOU
DOING THAT?
IT??IT'S EASIER TO GET THEM
TO COME TO THE TABLE
IF I'VE DEMONSTRATED MARKET
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRODUCT.
ONCE I'VE DEMONSTRATED??
WE HAVE TO BUILD
A WHOLE GUITAR COMPANY??
I'VE ALREADY DONE IT.
I'VE ALREADY DONE IT.
I HAVE
COMPLETE MANUFACTURING??
BUT YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ANY YET.
I HAVE??WE JUST LAUNCHED.
(Robert) JEFF, YOU CONFUSE ME
A LITTLE BIT.
OKAY.
'CAUSE I'M NOT CLEAR.
I MEAN, ANSWER THIS FOR ME.
OKAY.
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A GREAT GUITAR
OR DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY?
WELL, I WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY...
NO, NO, NO, NO.
BUILDING A GREAT GUITAR.
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A GREAT GUITAR.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU KNOW??
AND I THINK YOU HAVE
A GREAT PRODUCT.
I THINK WE CAN LICENSE IT.
WHAT WILL YOU SELL ME
THE RIGHTS TO THAT PATENT FOR?
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN...
49%, 51%...
(Robert) OKAY.
FOR $1 MILLION.
DO YOU SAY A MILLION?
YES.
(Harrington) A MILLION.
JEFF, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR $1 MILLION NOW.
I'M HAVING INDIGESTION,
BUT GO ON.
NOBODY KNOWS
THEY CAN'T DO WITHOUT THIS.
I'LL??I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
OKAY.
IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE GUITAR INDUSTRY,
YOU'RE A NOTHING?BURGER STILL.
I'LL GIVE YOU $500,000
FOR 51% OF THE COMPANY
THAT OWNS THIS PATENT.
SO??SO ANSWER THE QUESTION
FOR ME.
WHY DO I NEED YOU
TO LICENSE THE GUITAR?
I HAVE TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE
IN THE LICENSE SPACE.
YOU <i>WISH</i> I WAS YOUR PARTNER.
SO YOU SAID YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS
EXPERIENCE DOING LICENSE DEALS.
JUST HIT ME WITH ONE AS??
I MEAN, FOR??
MY WHOLE COMPANY THAT SOLD FOR
$3.2 BILLION WAS ALL LICENSES.
DID??DID YOU SAY $3.2
WITH A "B"?
YES, I DID.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
JEFF, I'M OUT, THEN.
JEFF, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.
I'M OUT.
YES OR NO?
(laughs) I WOULD ACCEPT
A DEAL, 50/50...
THAT'S NOT THE DEAL??
AND THEN??AND WE'RE DONE.
THAT'S NOT THE DEAL
ON THE TABLE.
(Daymond) THAT'S NOT THE DEAL
ON THE TABLE.
OKAY.
(Robert) YES OR NO?
I DON'T ACCEPT THE DEAL
THAT'S ON THE TABLE.
I'M STUNNED OF YOUR GREED,
YOUR ABSOLUTE GREED.
YOU JUST SAID THAT GREED??
WANTING TO MAKE MONEY
IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE
MONEY, AND YOU PASSED ON IT.
THAT'S NOT ALL THIS IS ABOUT.
YOU'RE A TRAGEDY.
YOU'RE A HUMAN TRAGEDY.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GIVEN ME
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.
YOU'RE??YOU'RE
BRILLIANT BUSINESS PEOPLE.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE, BUT I
HOPE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO WORK TOGETHER DOWN THE ROAD
ON THIS PROJECT OR ON OTHERS.
THERE IS NO TOMORROW.
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME WHEN YOU
SAY NO TO MY DEAL. YOU'RE DEAD.
YOU'RE GONE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE A VAPOR.
JEFF, THANKS. I'LL SEND YOU
AN INVOICE FOR MY TIME.
UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE.
I TOLD YOU SO.
WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG DEAL.
THAT WAS PAINFUL. PAINFUL.
(O'Leary) UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT GUY HAD A REAL SHOT
AT MAKING MONEY AND SAID NO.
THIS COULD BE $100 MILLION
ON TV. $100 MILLION.
THAT WAS PAINFUL.
THAT IS A HUMAN TRAGEDY,
AND HE'S TEACHING HIS SON THAT.
IT'S A CRIME.
HE SHOULD BE ARRESTED.
THEY'RE VERY SMART TO ASK
FOR THE DEAL THEY DID.
AND HOPEFULLY, I WAS
JUST AS SMART TO SAY NO.
OF COURSE YOU WERE.
TIME WILL TELL.
ASK ME 12 MONTHS FROM NOW
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS
THE RIGHT DECISION. (laughs)
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU $450,000?
NO.
$500,000?
