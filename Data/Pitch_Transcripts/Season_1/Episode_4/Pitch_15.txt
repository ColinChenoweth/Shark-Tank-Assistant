MY NAME IS KWAME KUADEY. I LIVE
IN ELLICOTT CITY, MARYLAND,
WITH MY WIFE
AND OUR NEWBORN DAUGHTER.
COMING TO AMERICA WAS
A BIG ACHIEVEMENT FOR ME,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WHERE I COME FROM,
THERE ARE
VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES.
I GREW UP IN A SMALL VILLAGE
IN GHANA, WEST AFRICA.
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, WE HAD
NO ELECTRICITY OR RUNNING WATER.
I REMEMBER I USED TO
DO MY HOMEWORK AT NIGHT
WITH A?A KEROSENE LAMP.
RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE,
I WAS RECRUITED INTO
A MANAGEMENT TRAINING PROGRAM.
RECENTLY, WITH HOW THE ECONOMY
TURNED WORSE,
MY POSITION GOT DISCONTINUED.
I'M KWAME KUADEY,
C.E.O. AND FOUNDER
OF GiftCardRescue.
I AM HERE SEEKING
A $150,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 30% STAKE
IN MY BUSINESS.
EACH YEAR, 10% OF ALL GIFT CARDS
SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES
GO UNUSED.
FOR 2008, $80 BILLION
IN GIFT CARDS WERE SOLD.
THAT MEANS THERE'S
AN $8?BILLION INDUSTRY OUT THERE
OF UNUSED GIFT CARDS.
WELL, GiftCardRescue HAS
A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.
WE HELP PEOPLE
TURN UNWANTED GIFT CARDS
INTO CASH.
AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
YOU GO TO OUR WEB SITE,
YOU ENTER
YOUR GIFT CARD INFORMATION.
WE'LL TELL YOU HOW MUCH
WE'LL PAY FOR YOUR GIFT CARD.
ON AVERAGE,
WE PAY ABOUT 65% TO 70%.
WE'LL THEN GIVE YOU AN ADDRESS
TO MAIL YOUR GIFT CARD TO US.
ONCE WE RECEIVE THE CARD
AND VERIFY THE VALUE,
WE'LL WIRE THE MONEY INTO YOUR
PayPal ACCOUNT WITHIN 24 HOURS.
WE THEN TURN AROUND
AND SELL THOSE GIFT CARDS
ON OUR WEB SITE
AT A DISCOUNT OF 10%.
AND WE MAKE MONEY ON THE SPREAD
BETWEEN HOW MUCH
WE BUY THE CARDS FOR
AND HOW MUCH WE SELL THEM FOR.
AND WITH VERY LITTLE MARKETING,
WE ARE ON TRACK TO SELL $120,000
IN GIFT CARDS THIS YEAR.
WALK ME THROUGH
THE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT.
YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVE
$120,000 IN SALES.
IS THAT THE FACE VALUE
OF THE CARDS YOU'VE SOLD,
OR IS THAT
WHAT YOUR PORTION IS?
IF I BUY A $100 CARD...
RIGHT.
FOR $65
AND I SELL IT FOR $90,
THE $90 IS WHAT COUNTS
TOWARDS THE SALES FIGURE.
SO ON THAT $120,000,
WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT?
SO FAR THIS YEAR,
WE'VE SOLD $55,000.
BUT WE ARE ON TRACK
TO SELL $120,000
FOR THE END OF THE YEAR.
KWAME, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL
MAKE ON THE $120,000, PROFIT?
WHAT WILL YOUR PROFIT BE?
OUR GROSS MARGIN IS 25%.
(O'Leary) WAIT A SECOND.
THAT'S WHERE I'M STUCK.
OKAY.
THERE'S A BIG ISSUE
IN YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.
OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENS IF ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU HAVE TO BUY
$100,000 WORTH OF CARDS
AND YOU ONLY SELL $30,000?
WHO CAPITALIZES THE DIFFERENCE?
OVER TIME, I HAVE LEARNED
WHICH CARDS SELL.
SO YOU REFUSE PEOPLE
THAT COME TO YOUR SITE?
YOU SAY, "I CAN'T BUY THAT CARD.
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN IT"?
YES. THERE ARE ABOUT
200 CARDS THAT I BUY.
IT'S MAINLY NATIONAL RETAILERS.
THERE ARE CERTAIN MERCHANTS
THAT I DON'T BUY CARDS FROM
BECAUSE I KNOW
THEY DON'T SELL.
YOUR MARGIN'S GOOD, AND YOU'VE
DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB
OF ANSWERING ALL THE QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.
SO, KWAME, YOU ASKED
FOR $150,000...
MM?HMM.
FOR 30%.
YES.
SO THAT MEANS 100% OF IT
IS WORTH ROUGHLY $500,000.
YES.
WHY IS IT WORTH $500,000 TODAY?
WELL, MY VALUATION IS BASED
ON THREE FACTORS.
NUMBER ONE IS THE SALES
AND??AND??AND GROWTH POTENTIAL
OF THE BUSINESS.
OKAY, SO THAT'S ONE??
POTENTIAL.
THAT'S ONE.
NUMBER TWO,
I WAS CONTACTED RECENTLY
BY THE BIGGEST ONLINE RETAILER,
AND THEY WANTED
A PARTNERSHIP WITH ME??
DO I KNOW
THIS ONLINE RETAILER?
YES, AMAZON.
(Harrington) WOW.
(Robert) OKAY,
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
BECAUSE??YES.
(Daymond) THAT'S A GREAT ONE.
GIVE ME THE THIRD ONE.
GIVE ME THE THIRD ONE.
I THINK IT'S ME.
KWAME...
I LIKE YOU, I THINK
THIS IS A GREAT BUSINESS.
BUT THIS IS NOT THE TYPE
OF BUSINESS I LOVE.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
(Barbara)
KWAME, I'M NOT INTERESTED.
I DON'T THINK I'M THE RIGHT
PARTNER FOR YOU. I'M OUT.
(Harrington) KWAME,
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.
IT'S JUST NOT READY
FOR ME TO TAKE THE RISK.
I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I'M OUT.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WORTH
WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE WORTH.
SO WE'RE GONNA START HERE.
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 50% OF YOUR BUSINESS,
BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY
A START?UP.
LET'S START THERE.
I HAVE A COUNTEROFFER.
GIVEN THE... WORK
I HAVE DONE SO FAR,
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR IT,
I'M WILLING TO OFFER 40%
OF MY BUSINESS FOR THE $150,000.
I THINK 50/50 PARTNERS
IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO.
I'M GONNA WRITE YOU A CHECK
FOR $150,000
ON AN IDEA THAT'S EMBRYONIC
BEHIND A REALLY GOOD GUY
THAT'S WILLING
TO WORK LIKE A DOG.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
BUT I'M NOT WILLING
TO CHANGE MY OFFER.
KWAME, I HAVE A TWIST
TO THE DEAL.
I WANTED TO SEE
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO,
BUT I'M GLAD YOU CAME BACK
WITH A COUNTEROFFER.
(exhales deeply)
I THINK YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
BUT I THINK YOU NEED MORE CASH
THAN $150,000.
SO I'M GONNA PARTNER WITH KEVIN.
I'M GONNA TAKE IT TO $200,000
FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS.
AND GUESS WHAT. YOU GET
TWO GREAT GUYS TO WORK WITH.
THIS GUY HAS SCREWED UP
MY DEAL,
BUT HE'S DONE IT
IN A VERY GOOD WAY FOR YOU.
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU LATER,
ROBERT.
(laughs)
(Robert)
EVERY NOW AND THEN IN YOUR LIFE,
AS YOU'RE TRYING
TO CHASE THE DREAM,
YOU GET TO A CROSSROAD WHERE YOU
HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.
WHICH WAY ARE YOU GONNA GO?
SO I'M GONNA PARTNER WITH KEVIN.
I'M GONNA TAKE IT TO $200,000
FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS.
AND GUESS WHAT. YOU GET
TWO GREAT GUYS TO WORK WITH.
WHICH WAY ARE YOU GONNA GO?
I WILL TAKE IT.
I THINK YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
IT'S A GREAT DEAL.
IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR YOU.
(Daymond) GOOD DEAL.
(Robert) CONGRATULATIONS, KWAME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT.
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.
YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU.
NICE JOB, MY FRIEND.
THIS IS GREAT.
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT.
THIS IS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
(Harrington)
GOOD LUCK, KWAME.
THAT WAS A GOOD DEAL.
IT'S A GREAT DEAL.
THIS GUY IS GONNA PULL IT OFF.
(Barbara) GREAT DEAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE COULD'VE
GOTTEN MORE FROM HIM.
ROBERT, YOU MADE ME BE
A NICER GUY THAN I WANTED TO BE,
AND THAT'S BAD.
DEEP DOWN, KEVIN,
I THINK WE'RE TWINS.
(scoffs)
I THINK WE'RE BOTH NICE GUYS.
I THINK
YOU'RE THE EVIL TWIN.
(laughs)
THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS ABOUT,
AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR IT.
I FEEL VERY BLESSED.
