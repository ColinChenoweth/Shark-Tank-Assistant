MY NAME IS PAUL WATTS.
GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS PAUL WATTS.
SO, PAUL, I'M IMPRESSED.
THANK YOU.
BUT WHY ARE THE TRUCKS HERE?
IS THE BUSINESS
YOUR PROPRIETARY CHEMICAL?
THE??THE BUSINESS IS
THE GRAFFITI REMOVAL SYSTEM,
NOT THE PRODUCT.
THE PRODUCT IS PROPRIETARY.
PAUL, HOW MUCH DOES IT COST
FOR ME TO START?UP??
TO BUY THE TRUCK,
BUY THE MACHINE?
LIKE, THAT STUFF'S GOTTA
COST A LOT OF MONEY.
(Harrington) PAUL, I HAVE
A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM.
YOUR SUCCESS IS GONNA BE BASED
ON YOU GETTING FRANCHISE FEES
PAID ON A MONTHLY BASIS, OKAY?
ONCE YOU PUT A GUY
INTO THIS BUSINESS,
WHY IS HE GONNA SEND YOU
A CHECK EVERY MONTH?
HE KNOWS THE BUSINESS.
HE'S GETTING HIS ACCOUNTS.
WHAT DOES HE NEED YOU FOR?
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE, PAUL.
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.
WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF HERE,
I WON'T EVEN THINK OF YOU AGAIN.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.
YES, YOU WILL.
NO, I WON'T.
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.
EVERY TIME YOU SEE GRAFFITI
ON A SIGN...
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.
YOU'RE GONNA SAY, "I SHOULD'VE
INVESTED IN THAT COMPANY,
'CAUSE HE CAN GO TO
THE MUNICIPALITY"...
NOPE. NEVER GONNA THINK??
"AND HE CAN BE
THEIR CONTRACTOR."
PAUL,
THERE'S A MILLION DEALS??
A MILLION DEALS
IN THE NAKED CITY.
THE NEXT GUY'S GONNA
WALK IN HERE AND GET MY MONEY,
PAUL, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,
BUT, UH, YOU'RE GONNA GET
RUN OVER.
