HELLO, I'M AMY.
I'M ALLISON.
AND WE'RE FROM COVERPLAY.
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ASK
FOR A $350,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 15%, UH, EQUITY
IN COVERPLAY.
THIS IS A PLAY YARD,
AND THEY ARE USED
IN PEOPLE'S HOMES,
THEY'RE USED ON CRUISE SHIPS,
THEY'RE USED ON??IN DAY CARE,
AND THEY ARE
A DISGUSTING MESS.
(sharks groan)
(Harrington) UH?OH.
OH.
THEY SPILL IN THERE.
THEY POOP IN THERE.
OH, STOP THE MADNESS.
(man) EW.
BABY FOOD, SNOT.
(man) THAT'S DISGUSTING.
AH! OH, MY...
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.
THIS IS A PETRI DISH...
UGH.
OF WHAT GOES ON
IN A TYPICAL PLAY YARD.
(Amy) SO THEN, WAIT.
YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE BABY
GOES IN HERE.
UGH!
OH, NOT THE BABY.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
THE ONLY SOLUTION.
(gasps)
COVERPLAY.
LET'S GO OVER HERE.
COVERPLAY IS THE FIRST
AND ONLY...
SLIPCOVER FOR PLAY YARDS.
SO YOU BRING THAT WITH YOU
WHEREVER YOU GO?
IS THAT THE IDEA?
WELL, THE HOTELS CAN PROVIDE IT
FOR THE GUESTS AS WELL.
SO, AMY, WHO??
WHO'S THE CUSTOMER?
IS IT THE HOTEL OR THE PARENT?
WE HAVE MULTIPLE??
MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS.
THE, UM, ON ONE END,
IT'S THE RETAIL.
IT'S THE ACTUAL CONSUMER.
SO IT'S THE GRANDPARENT
OR IT'S THE PARENT USING IT.
BUT THEN IT'S ALSO??WE CAN SELL
TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY.
THEY CAN USE IT
AS A RETAIL OUTLET AS WELL,
BECAUSE THEY CAN OFFER IT
TO THEIR GUESTS TO??
FOR PURCHASE.
WE LAUNCHED OUR PRODUCT, UM,
IT HIT THE SHELVES IN AUGUST
OF THIS PAST YEAR,
AND WE LAUNCHED IN TARGET.
WOW.
I'M IMPRESSED.
AND THE NUMBER IS?
AND THE NUMBER IS, UH,
WE'VE DONE $200,000 SO FAR.
WE GOT INTO THE LARGEST
HOTEL DISTRIBUTOR IN THE WORLD.
WE'RE SHIPPING MARRIOTT??
HILTON...
HILTON??
BEST WESTERN, WYNDHAM,
ROYAL CARIBBEAN,
CARNIVAL CRUISE LINE.
WHAT ARE THE SALES
THROUGH ALL THOSE CHANNELS?
WELL, THIS IS COLLECTIVELY.
IT'S UP TO $200,000.
AND THAT WAS
THE INITIAL OPENING ORDER?
YES.
DID ANYBODY REORDER?
YES.
YEAH.
WE'RE GETTING REORDERS
ALL THE TIME.
(Barbara)
ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS.
YEAH. DO YOU HAVE
A PATENT ON THIS?
(Allison) TWO.
(Amy) YES, WE HAVE
TWO U. S. PATENTS.
YOU HAVE DISTRIBUTION.
YOU HAVE SALES.
YOU HAVE A PATENT.
WHY DO YOU NEED ANY MONEY?
NOBODY KNOWS WE EXIST.
IT'S A BRAND?NEW PRODUCT.
WE JUST NEED
MORE PRODUCT AWARENESS.
AND THAT'S WHAT
OUR ACCOUNTS HAVE TOLD US.
NOBODY IS GOING INTO
A STORE RIGHT NOW...
AND LOOKING FOR COVERPLAY.
SAYING "I NEED A COVERPLAY.
I NEED A SLIPCOVER
FOR A PLAY YARD."
GIVE ME A REAL, TANGIBLE REASON
WHY YOU NEED $350,000
FOR YOUR BUSINESS TODAY,
BESIDES MARKETING.
HOW WILL YOU SPEND IT?
HOW WILL YOU??
(Allison) HOW WILL??
BREAK DOWN THE $350,000
REALLY QUICK.
OPERATION??OPERATIONAL COSTS.
OPERATION MEANS SALARIES,
YOU'RE SAYING?
IT MEANS SALARIES. IT MEANS??
EMPLOYEES, SALES REPS.
WARE??WAREHOUSING.
WHAT'S THE??THE AGE GROUP
OF??OF THE??
ZERO TO 2.
THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE
FROM ME IN MY BUSINESS,
BECAUSE WHAT I DO
IS TELEVISION ADVERTISING.
I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY
MASS?MARKET TV TIME
TO GO TO SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT
A ZERO TO 2 YEAR OLD...
BUT IT'S A??
BUT??BUT??BUT??JUST??
WHICH IS??WHICH IS
TOO NICHE FOR ME,
SO I'M GONNA SAY I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
AMY, HOW MUCH CASH
DO YOU HAVE INTO IT?
WE EACH ARE ABOUT, UH,
WHAT, $50,000?
YEAH.
INTO IT.
EACH OF YOU PUT UP
$50,000?
MM?HMM.
HOW LONG AGO?
(Allison) A YEAR AGO.
OKAY, SO A YEAR AGO,
LET'S SAY...
(O'Leary)
IT WAS WORTH $100,000.
IT WAS WORTH $100,000.
WITH NO SALES, NO NOTHING,
JUST T??
AND THE PATENTS
WERE PENDING, TOO.
JUST AN??JUST AN IDEA.
AND A YEAR LATER,
THERE'S $200,000 IN SALES.
(O'Leary) YOU'RE OFFERING ME
15% OF YOUR COMPANY
FOR $350,000.
THAT MEANS
YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE
YOUR COMPANY
IS WORTH $2 1/2 MILLION.
THAT'S A LOT OF PEEPEE
AND POOH POOH.
WE'VE GOTTEN INTO TAR??TARGET
DOESN'T TAKE UNBRANDED PRODUCTS.
I GET IT, BUT, LADIES,
DON'T BE??
BUT??BUT??HEAR??HEAR??
HEAR ME OUT. HEAR ME OUT.
DON'T BE SAVAGES.
WE'RE THE SHARKS, NOT YOU GUYS.
(both laugh)
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
IT'S NOT WORTH
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
(singsongy) OH, REALLY?
BUT I'M LOOKING
AT THE TWO OF YOU,
AND I'M THINKING
YOU GOT THAT SPUNK
THAT'S GONNA DRIVE THIS TRAIN
RIGHT TO THE FINISH LINE.
NOW HERE'S THE OFFER??
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $350,000
FOR 40% OF THE BUSINESS,
AND THE 40% IS NONNEGOTIABLE,
ALL RIGHT?
AND THE $350,000 IS TO BE USED
ONLY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE PRODUCT??
NOT FOR SALARIES,
NOT FOR LITTLE VACATIONS,
NOT FOR SPECIAL PROMOTIONS.
$350,000??THE FULL AMOUNT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR...
MM?HMM.
FOR 40% OF THE BUSINESS.
THAT LEAVES
BOTH OF YOU IN CHARGE.
OKAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU $350,000,
AND I WILL HAND IT TO YOU
TOWARDS THE MANUFACTURING
ON YOUR ORDERS.
AND THEN I WILL BE WILLING
TO FINANCE
ALL THE OTHER MANUFACTURING
AND PRODUCTION
FOR THE EXISTENCE
OF THE COMPANY.
BUT THAT COMES
WITH A 65% OWNERSHIP.
AMY, THERE'S TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
BARBARA'S OFFER IS $350,000
FOR 40% OF THE BUSINESS.
IT'S GOT
SOME PROBLEMATIC CONDITIONS
ON HOW TO USE THE MONEY.
DAYMOND'S OFFER IS $350,000
FOR 65% OF THE COMPANY.
BUT MINE ROLLS OVER TO YOU
HAVING A STRATEGIC PARTNER
WHO WILL FINANCE FOR THE REST.
THAT MEANS YOU GET
MY WAREHOUSING, TRUCKING,
BILLING, SHIPPING,
EVERYTHING.
AMY, ALLISON, WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS GO IN THE HALL...
OKAY, OKAY.
AND DISCUSS IT
AND THINK ABOUT IT?
THAT WE'LL DO.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
WE JUST NEED PEN, PAPER,
CALCULATORS. (laughs)
(Robert laughs)
THANK YOU.
OH, GOD.
ALLISON, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?
YOU DON'T??YOU DON'T CARE
SO MUCH ABOUT THE CONTROL.
BARBARA??
THESE GIRLS ARE CAPABLE.
THEY'RE TOTALLY CA??
BARBARA, YOU'RE BEING
TOO GENEROUS.
YOU'RE BEING TOO GENEROUS.
YOU'RE BEING
WAY TOO GENEROUS.
BARBARA, THIS IS MY BUSINESS.
LISTEN, THIS IS MY BUSINESS.
I KNOW THIS BUSINESS,
AND I NEED CONTROL.
IT'S A PRETTY COOL PATENT.
A VERY COOL PATENT.
IT'S A FANTASTIC PATENT.
(Harrington) YEAH.
(whispers)
TA?TA?TA?TA?TA.
(Allison)
SORRY FOR THE DELAY.
(laughs)
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
HERE'S OUR THOUGHT.
(Robert) OKAY.
WE DON'T WANT TO??WE DON'T WANT
TO GIVE UP CONTROLLING INTEREST
OF OUR COMPANY.
I COULD ASK FOR 50%
AND SAY LET'S BE EVEN.
I ASKED FOR ONLY 40%
OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR TALENT.
I JUST WANT TO BRING MY 35 YEARS
OF SAVVY BUSINESS EXPERIENCE??
I TOOK 1,000 BUCKS AND TURNED IT
INTO $66 MILLION,
WHICH WAS NO ACCIDENT??
AND BRING IT TO YOUR TABLE
TO HELP YOU.
BUT WHEN YOU START TALKING
ABOUT EXPERIENCE,
WE TALK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE.
SHE COULD RUN CIRCLES
AROUND ME
IN ANY ASPECT OF REAL ESTATE.
WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS BUSINESS.
WE ARE TALKING A DIFFERENT
UNDERSTANDING OF BUSINESS.
I'M WITH YOU, DAYMOND.
WHAT IF YOU GOT
A LITTLE MORE CASH?
IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH THE 65%,
WHAT IF I CAME IN WITH DAYMOND
AND GAVE YOU $450,000
INSTEAD OF THE $350,000
FOR THE 65%?
IT'S THE 65%
THAT BOTHERS US.
(Robert) $500,000.
TAKE THE MONEY,
YOU CRAZY CHICKENS.
TAKE THE MONEY.
ONE OF THE THINGS??
I KNOW YOU WANT THE 40%.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO COME DOWN ON YOUR PERCENT
AND TAKE PART OF THAT
AS OWNERSHIP IN THE PATENT?
WHOA. HOLD IT A MINUTE.
THIS INCLUDES THE PATENT.
THE PATENT'S
THE HEART OF THIS BUSINESS.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
PUT THAT TO THE SIDE.
AMY, THE PATENT WASN'T
PART OF THE COMPANY?
NO, THE PATENT IS??
THE PATENT IS SEPARATE.
ALLISON OWNS THE PATENT.
THE PATENT IS??
WHY HAVE YOU WASTED
OUR TIME?
MY??MY OFFER IS RETRACTED.
MINE, TOO.
YEAH, MY OFFER'S
OFF THE TABLE.
THE PATENT IS SEPARATE.
ALLISON OWNS THE PATENT.
MY??MY OFFER IS RETRACTED.
MINE, TOO.
YEAH, MY OFFER'S
OFF THE TABLE.
LADIES, PLEASE,
FOR THIS KIND OF MONEY,
YOU HAVE TO VET THE PATENT
INTO THE COMPANY.
WAIT. WHO OWNS THE PATENT?
ALLISON OWNS IT.
100%?
NO, I OWN 60%.
WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?
AMY OWNS A PORTION
AND MY EX?HUSBAND
OWNS A PORTION.
OH, MY.
YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT
INTO THE COMPANY.
RETRACTO!
WE NEEDED TO KNOW THAT.
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
VERY DIFFICULT??
(Robert) ALLISON??
RETRACT.
BUT SINCE I OWN??
THE FIRST FOUR WORDS OUT OF
YOUR MOUTH SHOULD'VE BEEN THAT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
IS YOUR EX?HUSBAND
A FRIENDLY EX?HUSBAND?
YES.
WILL HE VET THIS
INTO THE COMPANY
FOR A PIECE OF YOUR EQUITY?
YES.
NOW WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
CAN YOU??
JUST SO WE CAN DECIDE WHAT WE'RE
GONNA DO WITH OUR TIME TODAY??
IS THIS PATENT??IS IT AVAILABLE
TO PUT INTO THE COMPANY?
YES.
OKAY, ALLISON, JUST TELL ME
YOU'LL THROW THE PATENT
INTO THE COMPANY.
WE'LL THROW THE PATENT
INTO THE COMPANY.
(Barbara) OKAY.
OH!
(Robert) ARE WE??
ARE WE BACK, THEN?
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE WE BACK ON?
I LOVE THESE GIRLS. THESE ARE
CRAZY, CRAZY CHICKENS.
(Robert) WELL, HANG ON??
WAIT. LET'S MODIFY
THIS DEAL A LITTLE BIT.
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THE $350,000.
I WANT TO GO A THIRD, A THIRD,
A THIRD WITH DAYMOND.
WHAT'S THE DOLLAR AMOUNT
THAT??THAT'S ON THE TABLE?
$350,000.
NO. IT WAS UP TO $500,000.
IT WAS UP
TO $500,00 BEFORE.
$350,000 CASH.
YOU GET DAYMOND
AND THE BACK OFFICE,
WHICH IS AMAZING.
YOU UNCLE KEVIN AND YOU GET
ROBERT WHEN YOU NEED MORE CASH.
BUT WE GOTTA START AT 51%.
WELL, LET ME JUST MAKE
A COUPLE OF COMMENTS HERE.
ONE, MEN ALWAYS WANT
THE CONTROL.
THEY'LL PACKAGE IT THIS WAY
OR THAT WAY,
AND IT MAKES GREAT SENSE,
BUT IN THE END,
THEY WANT THE CONTROL.
I, TOO, HAD A MAJORITY PARTNER
AT ONE TIME,
AND HE ONLY WANTED
1 MORE PERCENT.
AND SEVEN YEARS LATER,
HE MARRIED MY SECRETARY.
HE LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY
AND ALMOST BROKE MY BACK.
SO I'VE BEEN THERE.
BARBARA, YOU ARE A BLACK WIDOW
IN STILETTOS.
(Daymond) BARBARA IS GREAT.
(Amy) BARBARA'S FABULOUS.
I THINK SHE MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
YOU'RE FABULOUS.
ONE OFFER IS THREE SHARKS,
$350,000, FOR 51%.
THE OTHER OFFER
IS ONE SHARK...
AN HONEST SHARK.
(O'Leary) A SHARKETTE.
FOR??FOR $350,000 WITH LOTS
OF CONDITIONS ON THE MONEY??
FOR 40%.
ONE.
WE HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION.
(Amy) THANK YOU, GUYS.
LADIES, LADIES, I THINK
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
(Daymond)
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
YOU DID NOT.
(Robert) HORRIBLE MISTAKE.
(O'Leary)
YOU MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.
(Allison)
I DON'T THINK WE DID.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?
YOU'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL,
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HAPPY.
WAIT AND SEE.
(Amy) WE MADE A GREAT DEAL.
LADIES, IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.
(Amy laughs) OKAY, GOOD?BYE.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
YOU GOT 'EM. YOU SH??
YOU OUT?SHARKED 'EM.
BARBARA AGAINST
THE THREE OF YOU GUYS?
HOW DID YOU GUYS LET BARBARA
TAKE DOWN THE THREE OF YOU?
YOU KNOW WHY?
THEY WERE TOO GREEDY.
(speaks indistinctly)
WELL DONE, BARBARA.
UNBELIEVABLE.
(Barbara) THANK YOU.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M CRYING.
YOU KNOW, THE OPPORTUNITY,
IT JUST GAVE US HOPE, YOU KNOW,
THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY
WILLING TO HELP US.
AND THEY BELIEVE
THAT OUR PRODUCT IS JUST...
IT HAS SOMETHING.
