MY NAME IS PAUL WATTS.
I'M THE FOUNDER AND OWNER
OF GRAFFITI REMOVAL SERVICES
IN SACRAMENTO.
(barks)
THIS IS MY DOG LEXIE.
SHE COMES TO WORK WITH ME
EVERY DAY. COME ON.
MY BUSINESS IS A MOBILE
GRAFFITI REMOVAL SERVICE.
I USED TO WORK FOR THE CITY OF
SACRAMENTO PAINTING LIGHT POLES,
AND THEN I WOULD ALWAYS SEE
GRAFFITI ON THE LIGHT POLES.
SO THEN I DECIDED,
I'M GONNA START A SERVICE
TO REMOVE THE GRAFFITI.
(machine whirring)
I'M GONNA START TAKING IT OFF
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.
GRAFFITI IN THE UNITED STATES
IS A HUGE ISSUE.
I MEAN, IT'S BLIGHTED
OUR COMMUNITIES EVERYWHERE.
AND THAT'S IT.
COME ON, LEXIE. COME.
I WANT TO FRANCHISE MY BUSINESS
AND GET A MOBILE
GRAFFITI REMOVAL SERVICE
IN EVERY CITY
ACROSS THE NATION.
THERE'S A HUGE MARKET OUT THERE
FOR GRAFFITI REMOVAL.
THAT'S WHY
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE SHARKS TO GET ON BOARD.
GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS PAUL WATTS.
I'M THE FOUNDER AND OWNER
OF GRAFFITI REMOVAL SERVICES.
G.R.S. IS THE NATION'S FIRST
COMPLETELY MOBILE
GRAFFITI REMOVAL FRANCHISE.
I'M HERE THIS EVENING
ASKING FOR AN INVESTMENT
OF $350,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15% OWNERSHIP
OF MY COMPANY.
BACK IN 1998, I WAS EMPLOYED
WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO
AS A FACILITY
MAINTENANCE PAINTER.
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL
A SATURDAY MORNING
WHEN I WAS VOLUNTEERING
FOR A COMMUNITY CLEANUP
THAT I NOTICED A HUGE SENSE
OF CIVIC PRIDE.
AND IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT
I HAD AN IDEA.
THAT I COULD CREATE A SERVICE
THAT COULD NOT ONLY
BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY
I WAS LIVING IN,
BUT ALSO MAKE A LITTLE
PART?TIME MONEY ON THE SIDE.
TODAY I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW GRAFFITI CAN BE REMOVED
EASILY AND EFFECTIVELY
WITH A BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT
THAT'S NONTOXIC
AND NON?DAMAGING.
OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS
CAN BE APPLIED
TO THE GRAFFITI...
SAFELY, EFFECTIVELY
AND EASILY.
SO, PAUL, I'M IMPRESSED.
THANK YOU.
BUT WHY ARE THE TRUCKS HERE?
IS THE BUSINESS
YOUR PROPRIETARY CHEMICAL?
THE??THE BUSINESS IS
THE GRAFFITI REMOVAL SYSTEM,
NOT THE PRODUCT.
THE PRODUCT IS PROPRIETARY.
IT COMPLEMENTS THE BUSINESS.
IT WORKS HAND IN HAND.
BUT YOU INVENTED THAT PRODUCT.
NO.
OH.
I INVENTED THE SYSTEM.
THE PRODUCT COMES FROM
ANOTHER MANUFACTURER.
AHH.
IT'S PROPRIETARY TO??YOU CAN'T
OWN A G. R. S. FRANCHISE
WITHOUT USING THIS PRODUCT,
BECAUSE??
BUT CAN ANYONE ELSE
GET THAT PRODUCT
WITHOUT THE G. R. S. FRANCHISE?
NOT IN A RETAIL OUTLET.
THEY COULD BUY IT
FROM THE MANUFACTURER,
SO I GET THE CIVIC DUTY PIECE,
AND THAT'S GREAT.
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR DUTY
TO MAKE MONEY FOR INVESTORS?
HOW WOULD I MAKE MONEY
GIVING YOU $350,000?
OFF ROYALTY FEES
AND FRANCHISE FEES.
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY FRANCHISES?
NO, SIR. I'VE ONLY BEEN APPROVED
THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF.
HAVE YOU GOT
ANY REVENUES AT ALL?
YES, SIR, I DO.
I HAVE MY COMPANY?OWNED LOCATION
IN SACRAMENTO
THAT NOW GENERATES
$230,000 A YEAR.
WHAT ARE YOU NETTING
OUT OF THAT $230,000?
$75,000.
PAUL, HOW MUCH DOES IT COST
FOR ME TO START?UP??
TO BUY THE TRUCK,
BUY THE MACHINE?
LIKE, THAT STUFF'S GOTTA
COST A LOT OF MONEY.
OUR LOW END TO GET INTO
A G. R. S. FRANCHISE IS $60,000.
60 GRAND?
OKAY, I?I?I BUY THAT THERE'S
A BUSINESS HERE, ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, AND I BUY IT.
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I GET 15% OF YOUR BUSINESS
FOR $350,000.
I MULTIPLY WHAT
THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS WORTH
BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
15% IS WORTH,
AND THAT'S OVER $2 MILLION.
YES, SIR.
AND YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
ONE FRANCHISE YET.
NO, I BASED THAT
OFF MY COMPANY LOCATION
IN SACRAMENTO
AND THE RATE OF GROWTH.
IT'S A HUGE NUMBER
YOU'RE THROWING OUT HERE.
$2 MILLION? YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
ONE FRANCHISE YET.
I MEAN, DOES THAT
REALLY MAKE SENSE?
SO WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
A FAIR PRICE WOULD BE?
I THINK I'D GET 110%
OF YOUR BUSINESS FOR $350,000.
I THINK THE FRANCHISE
IS ALREADY DEVELOPED.
IT'S ALREADY APPROVED.
AND THE COMPANY HAS NO DEBT.
WHAT I DON'T GET HERE IS,
THE GUY YOU SELL
OR THE WOMAN YOU SELL
WHO DRIVES THAT TRUCK,
HOW ARE THEY GONNA CONVINCE
A MUNICIPALITY
TO EVEN CHANGE THEIR WAYS
AND TRY A NEW PRODUCT
IN A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM
THAT'S NOTHING BUT RED TAPE?
I DON'T GET THAT. I DON'T
BUY IT. AND FOR THAT, I'M OUT.
(Harrington) PAUL, I HAVE
A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM.
YOUR SUCCESS IS GONNA BE BASED
ON YOU GETTING FRANCHISE FEES
PAID ON A MONTHLY BASIS, OKAY?
ONCE YOU PUT A GUY
INTO THIS BUSINESS,
WHY IS HE GONNA SEND YOU
A CHECK EVERY MONTH?
HE KNOWS THE BUSINESS.
HE'S GETTING HIS ACCOUNTS.
WHAT DOES HE NEED YOU FOR?
AND I?I DON'T THINK
THE FRANCHISE CONCEPT
IS GONNA WORK
FOR THIS BUSINESS.
ON THAT NOTE, I'M OUT.
YOU HAVE
NOTHING PROPRIETARY HERE??
NOT??NOT THE MACHINERY,
NOT THE IDEA
OR NOT EVEN THE CHEMICALS.
I'M SURE SOONER OR LATER,
AS SOON AS YOU
MAKE THIS MORE POPULAR,
THAT CHEMICAL COMPANY IS GONNA
MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL.
SO I CAN JUST GO AND PICK UP
THAT BOTTLE FOR $2,
SPRAY THE CRAP ON IT
AND WIPE IT AWAY.
AND WITH THAT... I'M OUT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $350,000,
BUT I'D HAVE TO??
I MEAN, I WANT 75%
OF THE BUSINESS.
ROBERT, I'LL GO IN
ON YOUR DEAL.
75%, THE GUY'S AN EMPLOYEE
OF OURS. HE WORKS FOR US.
IT'S A FANTASTIC DEAL.
75%, THE GUY'S AN EMPLOYEE
OF OURS. HE WORKS FOR US.
IT'S A FANTASTIC DEAL.
THANK YOU, BUT NO.
WH??
NO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NO"?
THERE'S NO "NO."
NO.
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE, PAUL.
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.
WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF HERE,
I WON'T EVEN THINK OF YOU AGAIN.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.
YES, YOU WILL.
NO, I WON'T.
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.
EVERY TIME YOU SEE GRAFFITI
ON A SIGN...
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME.
YOU'RE GONNA SAY, "I SHOULD'VE
INVESTED IN THAT COMPANY,
'CAUSE HE CAN GO TO
THE MUNICIPALITY"...
NOPE. NEVER GONNA THINK??
"AND HE CAN BE
THEIR CONTRACTOR."
PAUL,
THERE'S A MILLION DEALS??
A MILLION DEALS
IN THE NAKED CITY.
THE NEXT GUY'S GONNA
WALK IN HERE AND GET MY MONEY,
AND HE'LL GET RICH,
BUT NOT YOU.
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME
IF YOU TURN AROUND.
ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU DON'T
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT?
NO. THERE'S NOTHING
TO THINK ABOUT.
I??
THIS DEAL THAT??THIS DEAL
THAT YOU'RE OFFERING ME,
IT IS A SHARK DEAL.
OH.
ALL RIGHT. OPPORTUNITY KNOCKED.
NO ONE WAS HOME.
TURN AROUND. GET OUT OF HERE.
PAUL, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,
BUT, UH, YOU'RE GONNA GET
RUN OVER.
