MY NAME IS GINA COTRONEO.
I'M FROM DALLAS, TEXAS.
MY NAME IS GINA COTRONEO.
I'M THE FOUNDER OF
SOUL'S CALLING, INCORPORATED.
GINA, I GET YOU'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR YEARS.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES LIKE?
JUST GIVE ME DOLLAR NUMBERS
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.
THE LAST TWO YEARS?
GINA, IS THIS A MISSION THAT
YOU BELIEVE IN AS A BUSINESS
OR IS THIS A MISSION
THAT'S A PERSONAL GOAL FOR YOU?
THIS MISSION IS A BUSINESS.
HAPPINESS
IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS.
GINA, YOUR NUMBERS??
YOUR NUMBERS ARE...
SO SMALL.
YOU KNOW, I MADE MYSELF A DEAL
AFTER THE??THE LAST
TRADE SHOW THAT I WAS AT
THAT IF I DIDN'T MAKE
MY MONEY BACK ON THE TRADE SHOW,
THEN I WAS
GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.
WHEN I CAME BACK
FROM THAT TRADE SHOW...
I HIT THE WALL.
GINA, GINA, I?I ADMIRE
YOUR ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK,
BUT I'M??I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I SEE YOU
NOT AS A BUSINESSWOMAN.
I SEE YOU AS A MINISTER
OF GOODWILL.
I COULDN'T ENVISION
INVESTING IN YOUR BUSINESS
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE IT
AS A BUSINESS
THAT YOU EVEN
REALLY WANT TO RUN.
THIS STUFF IS GONNA
MAKE YOU GO CRAZY.
I'M OUT.
GINA, I??
BEFORE YOU THINK THIS ISN'T
A SERIOUS BUSINESS, I??
NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON A SEC.
I DO THINK
IT'S A SERIOUS BUSINESS,
GINA, I THINK
EVERY GREAT BUSINESS WAS STARTED
WITH GREAT EMOTION.
MM?HMM.
BUT AS YOU KNOW, THE REALITY IS,
YOU'VE GOT TO ADAPT.
THANK YOU, GINA.
GOOD LUCK
5 YEARS,
$18,000 IN SALES.
I MEAN, THAT JUST...
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
