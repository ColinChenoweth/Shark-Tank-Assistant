MY NAME IS GINA COTRONEO.
I'M FROM DALLAS, TEXAS.
AND MY COMPANY
IS SOUL'S CALLING INCORPORATED.
THE PURPOSE OF SOUL'S CALLING
IS TO ADD HAPPINESS
IN THE WORLD.
WE ARE ALL CONNECTED
WITH ONE ANOTHER.
SO THE COMPANY EXISTS
TO MAKE ITEMS
THAT REMIND PEOPLE
TO BE AT THEIR HAPPIEST SELF
AND??AND THEIR MOST JOYOUS SELF.
THE TAGLINE FOR SOUL'S CALLING
IS "SPEAK YOUR HEART."
SO BEFORE I SEND
EVERY PACKAGE OUT,
I PUT MY SPECIAL SIGNATURE
ON IT,
AND THAT'S A HAPPY HEART.
AND THEN THEY GET THE HUG.
AND IT GOES OUT TO THE PERSON
THAT RECEIVES IT.
IT'S ALL PART OF MY PLAN
FOR WORLD HAPPINESS DOMINATION.
MY NAME IS GINA COTRONEO.
I'M THE FOUNDER OF
SOUL'S CALLING, INCORPORATED.
AND I'M HERE
ASKING FOR $150,000
FOR 25% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
SOUL'S CALLING
IS GIFTS AND ACCESSORIES.
EVERYTHING HAS
A POSITIVE MESSAGE ON IT
AND POSITIVE ENERGY IN IT.
THE LINE REALLY KIND OF STARTED
OUT OF A HEALING PROCESS.
IN 1997,
WHILE LIVING IN DALLAS,
I SURVIVED AN ATTACK
IN MY APARTMENT.
AND DUE TO THE NATURE
OF THE CRIME, UH,
IT BECAME VERY HIGH PROFILE.
AND MY STORY WAS TOLD
LOTS OF PLACES.
AND AS THAT HAPPENED,
I NOTICED SOMETHING??
THAT WHAT THIS ONE PERSON
HAD DONE TO ME,
THIS ONE NEGATIVE ACTION,
REALLY SPREAD OUT
AS A RIPPLE EFFECT,
AND AFFECTED
LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
AND I THOUGHT THAT IF SOMEBODY
COULD AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WITH A NEGATIVE ACTION,
THEN SOMEBODY COULD AFFECT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WITH A POSITIVE ACTION.
AND SOUL'S CALLING
WAS BORN OUT OF THAT.
IN 2004, I DECIDED
I COULD REALLY, MAYBE,
POTENTIALLY MAKE
A BUSINESS OUT OF THIS.
AND THE FIRST OBJECT
THAT I LAUNCHED WITH
IS THE INSPIRELLA UMBRELLA.
(laughs)
THESE ALL HAVE
HAPPY SAYINGS ON 'EM.
THIS ONE SAYS
"LET YOUR SMILE BE SUNSHINE."
YOU KNOW, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
WALKED DOWN A NEW YORK STREET
AND SEEN NOTHING
BUT BLACK UMBRELLAS?
YOU KNOW,
THAT IS KIND OF DEPRESSING.
AND IF SOMEBODY WERE TO CARRY
ONE OF THESE,
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE
MIGHT SEE THIS MESSAGE
AND BE AFFECTED BY THAT
IN A POSITIVE WAY.
AND AFTER THAT
CAME THE CONNECTION BRACELET.
IT COMES IN TWO PIECES.
THEY SNAP TOGETHER.
EACH PIECE SAYS
"WE ARE ALL CONNECTED."
(man) THANK YOU.
SO I'M JUST GIVING YOU THOSE
AS A REMINDER.
(Barbara) THANK YOU.
OH, COOL. THANK YOU.
THE NEXT OBJECT THAT CAME UP
WERE SOLE SEEKERS SANDALS.
THESE LEAVE WORDS IN THE SAND
WHEN YOU WALK.
(chuckles)
WHAT A GREAT IDEA.
LORI IS GOING TO DEMONSTRATE
IN THE SAND.
THE BOTTOMS ARE RECYCLED
FLIP?FLOPS AND RUBBER??30%.
AND THE STRAPS
ARE NATURAL RUBBER.
GINA, I GET YOU'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR YEARS.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES LIKE?
JUST GIVE ME DOLLAR NUMBERS
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.
THE LAST TWO YEARS?
$11,000 AND $18,000
RESPECTIVELY.
I MEAN, ONE THING I'LL SAY ABOUT
YOU IS YOU KNOW YOUR NUMBERS,
EXCEPT THEY'RE
REALLY SMALL NUMBERS.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I NEED TO BE BIGGER.
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU PUT
INTO THIS BUSINESS SO FAR?
CLOSE TO $100,000...
I BELIEVE THAT.
OF MY OWN MONEY.
IT'S BEEN EVERY TAX REFUND
THAT I'VE HAD,
EVERY, YOU KNOW, BONUS WHEN
I HAD A JOB, EVERY... (laughs)
IS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO KEEP THIS GOING?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHY?
BECAUSE IT IS PART OF
MY MISSION ON THE PLANET.
GINA, IS THIS A MISSION THAT
YOU BELIEVE IN AS A BUSINESS
OR IS THIS A MISSION
THAT'S A PERSONAL GOAL FOR YOU?
THIS MISSION IS A BUSINESS.
HAPPINESS
IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS.
AND, YES, I'M TOUCHY?FEELY,
BUT I DO THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING OF VALUE HERE,
OR I WOULDN'T KEEP GOING
WITH IT.
IT'S NOT JUST A LABOR OF LOVE.
I'M DETERMINED.
I AM A DETERMINED PERSON.
I HAVE A PRODUCT
THAT PEOPLE WANT.
THEY FALL IN LOVE
WITH MY PRODUCT.
AND I KNOW THAT I CAN
MAKE MONEY WITH THAT.
I JUST NEED SOME HELP.
GINA, YOUR NUMBERS??
YOUR NUMBERS ARE...
SO SMALL.
YOU KNOW, I MADE MYSELF A DEAL
AFTER THE??THE LAST
TRADE SHOW THAT I WAS AT
THAT IF I DIDN'T MAKE
MY MONEY BACK ON THE TRADE SHOW,
THEN I WAS
GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.
WHEN I CAME BACK
FROM THAT TRADE SHOW...
I HIT THE WALL.
(voice breaking)
AND I LITERALLY ASKED...
UNIVERSE, GOD, FORCE??
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THAT??
SORRY.
ALL RIGHT. WHAT I'M DOING
ISN'T WORKING.
I'M DOING EVERYTHING
THAT I KNOW HOW TO DO
TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS WORK.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
WHAT DO I DO?
WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE NUMBERS.
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT NUMBERS,
THEY NEVER LIE.
YOU TOLD ME THAT
I SHOULD GIVE YOU $150,000
AND I WOULD OWN 25%
OF YOUR COMPANY.
CORRECT.
THAT MEANS YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOUR COMPANY IS WORTH,
TODAY, FOUR TIMES THAT AMOUNT.
600??$600,000.
$600,000.
I'M AN INVESTOR.
I GOTTA BE TRUE TO THAT
BECAUSE I KNOW MONEY
HAS NO SOUL, ALL RIGHT?
I NEVER, EVER, EVER
LET EMOTION GET IN THE WAY
OF AN INVESTMENT.
YOUR BUSINESS
IS NOT WORTH $600,000.
HERE'S WHAT IT'S WORTH??ZERO.
THAT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY MONEY.
SOMEBODY HAS TO TELL YOU THAT.
IT MIGHT AS WELL BE ME.
NO, I WILL NOT
GIVE YOU ANY MONEY.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
GO ON WITH THIS. I'M OUT.
WELL, I?I APPRECIATE
YOUR OPINION.
UM, BUT...
YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR THIS.
AND I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO.
AND I THINK
THAT IT'S A CALLING.
I THINK THAT YOU CAN HEAL
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
BUT AS A BUSINESS, IT'S NOT
HERE FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
GINA, GINA, I?I ADMIRE
YOUR ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK,
BUT I'M??I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I SEE YOU
NOT AS A BUSINESSWOMAN.
I SEE YOU AS A MINISTER
OF GOODWILL.
I COULDN'T ENVISION
INVESTING IN YOUR BUSINESS
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE IT
AS A BUSINESS
THAT YOU EVEN
REALLY WANT TO RUN.
THIS STUFF IS GONNA
MAKE YOU GO CRAZY.
I'M OUT.
GINA, I??
BEFORE YOU THINK THIS ISN'T
A SERIOUS BUSINESS, I??
NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON A SEC.
I DO THINK
IT'S A SERIOUS BUSINESS,
AND I??AND I DISAGREE
WITH BARBARA.
I THINK YOU ARE
A SERIOUS BUSINESSPERSON.
I JUST THINK THAT THE BUSINESS
IS TELLING YOU SOMETHING.
THIS IDEA MAY NOT BE A GOOD ONE
AS A BUSINESS.
AND IT MAY BE TIME TO CHANGE.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT MAYBE
YOU'VE REACHED THAT POINT
WITH THIS BUSINESS?
NOT YET, NO.
THIS WILL ALWAYS EXIST
AT WHATEVER LEVEL
I CAN MAKE IT EXIST AT.
GINA, I THINK
EVERY GREAT BUSINESS WAS STARTED
WITH GREAT EMOTION.
MM?HMM.
BUT AS YOU KNOW, THE REALITY IS,
YOU'VE GOT TO ADAPT.
AND YOU'RE NOT ADAPTING TO WHAT
THE BUSINESS IS TELLING YOU.
OKAY.
YOU GOTTA LET THIS GO.
I'M OUT.
WELL, I REALLY APPRECIATE
ALL OF YOUR ADVICE,
AND THANK YOU.
(Robert) OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU, GINA.
GOOD LUCK
5 YEARS,
$18,000 IN SALES.
I MEAN, THAT JUST...
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
I THINK, BARBARA, IT'S PROBABLY
A PASSION AND CALLING FOR HER,
NOT A BUSINESS.
A PASSION? IT'S A RELIGION.
AS LONG AS PEOPLE
NEED HAPPINESS,
SOUL'S CALLING WILL BE THERE
TO PROVIDE IT.
