HI, MY NAME IS DAN CLAFFEY.
I'M THE FOUNDER
OF COFFEE BRAND GIFTS.
I'M HERE TODAY ASKING FOR
A $300,000 MINIMUM INVESTMENT.
I'M WILLING TO GIVE 40% EQUITY
OF COFFEE BRAND GIFTS COMPANY.
IN 1999, I WENT TO
A COFFEE TRADE SHOW
CALLED COFFEE FEST.
ONLY 2% OF THE 500 COMPANIES
THAT WERE AT THE TRADE SHOW
HAD COFFEE NOVELTIES
AND GIFTS.
I SAID TO MYSELF, "WOW.
WHY DON'T I DEVELOP PRODUCTS
FOR THIS INDUSTRY?"
SO WHAT I DID WAS THIS??
CONTACTED MY PATENT ATTORNEY
AND SAID, "CAN I TRADEMARK
THE WORD CAPPUCCINO, ESPRESSO,
"LATTE, DECAF, MOCHA AND JAVA
FOR THE TOYS, GAME BOARDS,
PLUSH TOYS?"
AND HE SAID,
"WELL, YOU GOT A 50/50 CHANCE."
SO I WENT FOR IT.
NO ONE HAS EVER PUT
THE FAMOUS COFFEE BRANDED NAMES
ON THE PLUSH TOY INDUSTRY.
DID YOU GET THE PATENTS
OR NOT?
YES, I GOT ALL THE PATENTS.
SO, DAN, YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY
IN THE WORLD
THAT CAN MAKE A TEDDY BEAR
WITH THE WORD "COFFEE" ON IT?
I'M ONLY GUY IN THE U. S.??
ALL RIGHT, DAN, I'LL BUY THAT
YOU HAVE A TRADEMARK.
WHY DO I CARE?
OKAY, I HAVE DONE SURVEYS
OUT AT COFFEE SHOPS??
EXTENSIVE SURVEYS??
AND PEOPLE WHO WERE KIND ENOUGH
TO SIT AND LOOK AT THE GAME,
AND SOMETIMES PLAY THE GAME??
DAN, YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ORDERS
FOR ANY OF THIS CRAP?
I HAVE??I HAVE??
DO YOU HAVE PURCHASE ORDERS
FROM SOMEBODY WHO WANTS
A THOUSAND BEARS WITH THE WORD
"CAPPUCCINO" ON IT?
I HAVE COMMITMENTS FROM??
I HAVE COMMITMENTS
FROM A LOT OF COMPANIES.
DAN, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IS THAT LIKE WHEN I WAS YOUNG
AND IN A BAR
AND A?A GIRL SAID
SHE'D CALL ME AND NEVER DID?
I HAVEN'T TAKEN ORDERS YET
BECAUSE I'M THIS CLOSE.
I JUST NEED??JUST THE CAPITAL TO
GET THE PRODUCT OFF THE GROUND.
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING IT A LITTLE BACKWARDS?
WHY NOT GET THE ORDERS FIRST?
I HAVEN'T GONE AND??AND, UH,
PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION
TO WHERE I WOULD NEED
A LOT OF SALES RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S THE BIGGEST POSITION
YOU NEED TO PUT YOURSELF IN.
(O'Leary) LET ME GET THIS RIGHT.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY ORDERS YET.
I GIVE YOU $300,000.
WE MAKE A LOT OF BEARS.
WE MAKE A LOT OF GAMES.
WE MAKE A LOT OF STUFF??
TCHOTCHKE STUFF.
IT DOESN'T SELL.
THEN I KILL YOU.
(laughs)
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE,
PERSONALLY, INTO THIS BUSINESS?
I PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT
$400,000 OR $500,000??
WHOA.
DAN, DANIEL, PLEASE STOP. IT'S
PAINFUL FOR ME TO HEAR THIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT BUSINESS
YOU OUGHT TO BE IN?
THE RESEARCH BUSINESS.
YOU ARE SO GOOD AT IT.
YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING
THIS THING TO DEATH,
AND YOU MISSED THE MARK.
YOU DON'T HAVE AN ORDER.
I AM OUT.
LISTEN...
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE
HAS BEEN DONE
IN A TIMELY FASHION.
THIS MOMENT IN FRONT OF YOU
RIGHT NOW
IS THE PERFECT MOMENT.
GETTING ORDERS IS THE ONLY THING
YOU HAVEN'T DONE.
AND GUESS WHAT. I??
GUESS WHAT.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET ORDERS
AND PROMISE DELIVERY
UNTIL I HAD CAPITAL
TO GET 'EM DONE.
(O'Leary and Daymond) NO!
(O'Leary) NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DANIEL, WHAT YOU JUST SAID
WAS UN?AMERICAN.
IT WAS UN?AMERICAN.
THEN I AGREE WITH YOU??
I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.
FROM NOW ON,
I'M GONNA DO IT YOUR WAY.
I'M GONNA GET THE ORDERS.
I'M GONNA??AND??AND THEN
WE'RE GONNA SELL THE PRODUCT.
DAN, ARE YOU AFRAID OF SALES?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
YOU ARE!
25 YEARS, I'VE BEEN IN SALES
AND MARKETING,
AND I'M
THE TOP OF MY FIELD, 5%.
AND YOU HAVE NO SALES HERE.
I'M OUT.
DAN, YOU SAID
YOU'RE TOP IN SALES,
BUT THERE??
THERE ARE NO SALES HERE.
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I?I CAN'T GO FORWARD. I'M OUT.
DAN, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
MY MONEY.
TWO YEARS FROM NOW,
WE'RE GONNA BE SITTING AROUND,
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A MILLION
REASONS AND A MILLION EXCUSES
WHY MY MONEY'S GONE, AND WE'RE
NOT GONNA HAVE ANY ORDERS.
I'M OUT.
SO I'M COMPLETELY OUT BECAUSE I
DIDN'T GET A PURCHASE ORDER?
DANIEL, STOP.
WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE.
A MILLION PEOPLE DRINK COFFEE.
NOT A MILLION PEOPLE
MAY WANT TO BUY BEARS.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" PUBLISHED
AN??AN ARTICLE TWO WEEKS??
THEN WHY ARE THERE NO ORDERS?
TWO WEEKS AGO??
WHY ARE THERE NO ORDERS?
YOU'VE COMPLETELY WASTED
MY TIME.
I'M OUT.
THAT'S FINE.
WAS IT??THANK YOU.
AND I?I THANK YOU.
BUT I'D SAY THIS, THAT??
WHAT ARE YOU
THANKING ME FOR?
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE
IS YOUR PERCEPTION OF ME.
YOU'RE MAKING A JUDGMENT CALL,
AND YOU HAVE??
NO.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO THAT.
YOU HAVE NO SALES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
