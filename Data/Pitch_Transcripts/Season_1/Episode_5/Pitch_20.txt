HI, I'M RODOLFO SACCOMAN.
AND I'M ALEXIS SACCOMAN,
AND WE'RE BROTHERS
ORIGINALLY FROM BRAZIL.
I'M A THERAPIST,
AND I HAVE A PRIVATE PRACTICE
IN SAN FRANCISCO.
I'M DIRECTOR
OF ONLINE MARKETING
FOR A MAJOR RESORT
IN PALM BEACH, FLORIDA.
WE COMBINED BOTH
OF OUR EXPERTISE
TO CREATE
AN INNOVATIVE BUSINESS
THAT HAS TONS
OF MONEYMAKING POTENTIAL,
BUT ALSO,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY EVEN,
TO HELP PEOPLE.
WE STARTED IN BRAZIL
AND WERE THERE
PRETTY MUCH UNTIL THE AGE
OF 6 AND THE AGE OF 10.
RIGHT.
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN MY FATHER
MADE HIS BIG BREAK.
HE STARTED AS A FACTORY WORKER
IN BRAZIL.
WORKING HIS WAY
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,
THEN COLLEGE
AND THEN TWO MASTER'S DEGREE.
HE KNEW THAT HE WANTED ALEXIS
AND MYSELF TO LEARN ENGLISH,
BECAUSE IF WE LEARNED ENGLISH,
EVENTUALLY WE COULD GET
TO THE U. S.
AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SHARKS
WILL JUSTIFY
OUR PARENTS' SACRIFICE??
OVER 14 YEARS SINCE
I LANDED IN THE U. S.??
TO CREATE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL,
AND FINALLY WE CAN TASTE
A BIT OF THIS AMERICAN DREAM.
HELLO. MY NAME
IS RODOLFO SACCOMAN.
AND I AM ALEXIS SACCOMAN.
WE'RE THE FOUNDERS AND CREATORS
OF OUR WEB SITE??
MY THERAPY JOURNAL.
TODAY WE'RE HERE
TO ASK $80,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR BUSINESS.
NOW IF YOU'LL
PLEASE INDULGE US
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES
FOR FIVE SECONDS?
THINK OF SOMETHING
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD...
SOMETHING THAT
MAKES YOU HAPPY.
$10 MILLION.
(laughs)
(Rodolfo) OKAY.
PLEASE OPEN YOUR EYES.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
IN BUSINESS FOR??
TO GIVE THAT FEELING
TO MORE PEOPLE MORE OFTEN
AND IN MORE PLACES.
WE ARE
REVOLUTIONIZING THERAPY.
WHAT MY THERAPY JOURNAL
OFFERS
IS AN ONLINE
PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TOOL.
WE PROVIDE THE MOST EFFECTIVE
AND AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE
TO TRADITIONAL THERAPY.
SO, ALEXIS, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PROVIDE AND SHARE
A LITTLE BIT OF
WHAT OUR SOFTWARE DOES?
SURE. CURRENTLY, THE ENTIRE
WEB SITE IS DATA?DRIVEN.
SO FAR, THE COMPANY
HAS TWO COMPONENTS??
THE FIRST IS JOURNALING
THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO POUR YOUR HEART OUT
IN THE MOST SECURE
OF ONLINE JOURNALS.
THE SECOND COMPONENT
IS THE PROGRESS QUESTIONS
AND THE PROGRESS GRAPH.
IT ALLOWS YOU TO TRACK
ANY EMOTION, BEHAVIOR...
MM?HMM.
DIAGNOSIS, PROBLEM,
AMBITION, HOBBY??
IT ALLOWS YOU TO TRACK
ANYTHING YOU WANT,
AND IT GRAPHS IT FOR YOU
IN A LINE GRAPH
SO THAT EVERY TIME YOU LOG ON,
YOU GET TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING TODAY
AS COMPARED TO LAST WEEK,
LAST MONTH OR LAST YEAR.
OKAY, THAT'S WONDERFUL,
BUT HOW DO I MAKE <i>MONEY</i>
OFF DEPRESSED PEOPLE?
WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE
THAT HAVE SIGNED UP.
WE HAVE PAYING CUSTOMERS. THIS,
AGAIN, IS MAKING MONEY TODAY.
THERE'S NO OVERHEAD COST.
WHAT ARE THEY PAYING?
IF THEY SIGN UP FOR A FULL YEAR,
IT IS $7.95 PER MONTH.
IF THEY DO A 3?MONTH PERIOD,
THEN IT'S $11.95 PER MONTH,
AND IF THEY JUST DO
ON A MONTH?BY?MONTH BASIS,
IT IS $14.95.
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU GROSSED THIS YEAR?
LAST YEAR
WE DID ABOUT $4,000.
BUT DIDN'T YOU JUST
SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT A THOUSAND MEMBERS?
WE HAVE??YES. THIS IS HOW
THE SYSTEM WORKS??
NOT PAYING MEMBERS.
1,120, AS OF TODAY,
HAVE SIGNED UP
FOR A FREE TRIAL.
IT'S A 14?DAY FREE TRIAL.
OKAY. I UNDERSTAND.
AFTER THE 14?DAY FREE TRIAL,
THEY HAVE AN OPTION
TO BUY A SUBSCRIPTION.
HOW MANY PEOPLE
TURNED OVER TO BUYING?
10% OF THOSE FOLKS
BECOME A PAYING CUSTOMER.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HIT THE SITE?
WE HAD ABOUT 18,000 PEOPLE
HIT THE SITE.
YOU KNOW THAT'S LOW, RODOLFO.
I COMPLETELY AGREE
THAT IT IS LOW,
THE AMOUNT OF VISITORS
WE HAVE HAD.
WE HAVE INVESTED $125,000
OF OUR LIFE'S SAVINGS
TO CREATE THIS.
95% OF THOSE FUNDS WENT
TO DEVELOP THE SOFTWARE.
WE DIDN'T HAVE THOSE FUNDS
FOR ADVERTISING.
WE DON'T HAVE A P. R. AGENCY.
THE WAY WE HAVE DONE IT
MOSTLY IS WORD OF MOUTH.
I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD
HOW MANY PAYING USERS YOU HAVE.
I THINK AROUND 121 PAYING.
IS NOT VERY MUCH.
THE PERCENTAGE??
I JUST WANT TO PAUSE
FOR A MOMENT IF I MIGHT.
YES.
YES.
I LIKE YOU, BUT I SURE DON'T
LIKE THIS BUSINESS IDEA,
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
GUYS,
WITH 120 PAYING CUSTOMERS,
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE FOR ME.
I?I'M GONNA BOW OUT AND??
LET ME SAY THAT
THIS IS...
THANK YOU.
THE INFANCY.
I'M OUT.
THIS IS THE INFANCY
OF THIS WEB SITE.
WE'RE CURRENTLY
IN THIRD STAGE CONVERSATIONS
WITH AETNA,
THE INSURANCE COMPANY.
THEY HAVE 37 MILLION
PEOPLE WITH??
TELL US ABOUT THAT.
(Robert)
SEE, THAT'S INTERESTING.
THAT'S INTERESTING. NOW YOU'VE
GOT MY JUICES FLOWING.
SURE. WE GOT CONNECTED
TO SOME FOLKS THAT SAW
THE POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCT
IN AN INSURANCE WORLD.
SO, RODOLFO,
NOW YOU'RE INTERESTING.
OKAY.
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT...
OKAY.
YOU HAD INSIGNIFICANT USERS.
OKAY.
FRANKLY, THE SITE...
REALLY INSIGNIFICANT.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
IT'S REALLY AN ONLINE JOURNAL.
BUT WHO CARES?
IF YOU CAN GET
A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY...
YEAH, YEAH. I GET THE JOKE.
I GET THE JOKE.
TO PROMOTE THIS AS PART
OF GET?WELL THERAPY,
WELL, MY FRIENDS,
MY FELLOW IMMIGRANT FRIENDS...
RIGHT.
RIGHT.
WE'RE ON TO SOMETHING.
IT'S VERY CLEAR.
A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY
SIGNS UP...
CORRECT.
PROVIDES THIS TO THEIR MEMBERS??
IN FACT, BETTER SCENARIO??
THEY FORCE THEIR MEMBERS
TO GET INSURANCE TO LOG ON.
EVERYBODY HAS TO PAY YOU
A CERTAIN FEE.
LET ME THROW OUT
AN IDEA TO YOU.
YES.
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU $80,000
FOR 50%?
OKAY.
IS IT CONTINGENT ON AETNA?
BECAUSE I'D BE INTERESTED
IN POTENTIALLY COMING IN
FOR MAYBE EVEN MORE MONEY,
BUT TO ME,
THE COMPANY HAS NO VALUE??
UNTIL THE AETNA DEAL.
NO VALUE... OR ANY OTHER
SIMILAR INSURANCE COMPANY.
I'D WANT TO??
I'D BE WILLING
TO PARTNER WITH YOU,
BECAUSE I THINK THE POTENTIAL
IS VERY INTERESTING.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU STARTED
THE PRESENTATION,
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER
INTERNET BIRDBRAIN IDEA.
LOTS OF THOSE ARE OUT THERE.
YOU GUYS
ARE NOT CRAZY CHICKENS.
GUYS, I WANT IN ON THIS.
SO, RODOLFO,
HERE'S THE OFFER,
AND, UH, DAYMOND AND KEVIN??
$80,000 FOR 51%
OF THE BUSINESS.
THAT'S THE OFFER.
GENTLEMEN, DID YOU NOTICE THAT
SUBTLE CHANGE THAT HAPPENED
IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES?
WHO ARE YOU?
I JUST WANT TO BRING
YOUR ATTENTION TO IT.
ARE YOU THE OFFER MAKER?
BARBARA. BARB. BARB.
CAN WE HELP YOU?
WHO'S THIS?
I THOUGHT I HAD HEARD 50%.
(Robert) I HEAR A VOICE...
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M HEARING 51%.
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYBODY.
DID YOU CATCH THAT LITTLE 1%?
YEP.
WE'RE CATCHING EVERYTHING.
(Alexis) YES. (laughs)
RODOLFO, MY FRIEND KEVIN
MADE A SUBTLE MISTAKE.
BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALLY NEED,
ALONG WITH THE MONEY,
IS YOU NEED SOME GUIDANCE.
YES.
AND BETWEEN MR. BILLIONAIRE
SELLER OF SOFTWARE BUSINESS
AND MR. INTERNET OVER HERE,
I THINK THAT THERE IS
A TREMENDOUS VALUE ON THAT.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
BETTER PARTNERS.
LISTEN, COULD WE TAKE
A MOMENT? OKAY?
TAKE A MOMENT. TAKE A MOMENT.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
ROBERT?
YEP.
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK OF ME AS COLD.
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK
OF YOU THAT WAY, KEVIN.
WHAT DO WE NEED DAYMOND FOR?
(Alexis)
YOU'RE A SEPARATE DEAL?
YEAH.
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE DON'T NEED HIM.
HE DOESN'T BRING
ANYTHING TO THE TABLE.
I BRING $120,000
TO YOU.
AT 51% FOR YOU?
FIFTY?FIFTY.
ALEXIS, HERE'S WHAT
I'M GONNA TELL YOU.
KEVIN IS RIGHT. DAYMOND ADDS
NO VALUE TO THIS DEAL.
HE'S NEVER DONE A DEAL
ON THE INTERNET.
WHO'S TRYING TO DO CASH, BABY?
AND HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA SAY
TO YOU ABOUT YOUR 49/51.
OUT OF THE FOUR OF US HERE
THAT MATTER,
WHICH ONE OF US HAVE EVER BUILT
AND SOLD AN INTERNET COMPANY
FOR A FEW HUNDRED
MILLION DOLLARS?
MY POINT IS, GUYS,
YOU'RE GONNA GO INTO PARTNERSHIP
WITH TWO GUYS
THAT HAVE MADE
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS...
(exhales)
IN THE INTERNET?
GO FOR THIS ONE.
DID YOU COME TO THIS COUNTRY
TO HAVE SOMEBODY CONTROL
YOUR BUSINESS?
YOU GUYS??YOU GUYS ARE GOOD,
YOU KNOW? THIS IS??
ALEXIS, <i>WE'RE</i> GOOD. I DON'T KNOW
WHY DAYMOND IS STILL TALKING,
'CAUSE AS I??
I'M JUST??LISTEN, THESE GUYS
COULD BE MY POTENTIAL PARTNERS,
AND YOU ARE TRYING??
FOR A CORPSE,
HE MAKES A LOT OF NOISE.
YOU ARE TRYING
TO CONTROL THEIR BUSINESS
WHERE I'M OFFERING THEM 50%.
DAYMOND, DO YOU EVEN HAVE
AN OFFER ON THE TABLE?
YES.
WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?
$120,000, FIFTY?FIFTY.
OH, SO LET ME UNDERSTAND THIS.

EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE NEVER MADE
ANY MONEY IN THE INTERNET SPACE.
FOR THE EXTRA 40 GRAND,
THEY SHOULD TAKE YOUR OFFER?
ALSO IT WAS FIFTY?FIFTY
VERSUS 51/49.
FIFTY?FIFTY. YEAH.

(Daymond) PARTNERS?
PARTNERS.
SO IT'S FIFTY?FIFTY?
YOU'RE GOING TO TRUST THAT WE'LL
LOOK AFTER YOUR BEST INTERESTS
BECAUSE WE'RE INVESTORS,
AND WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
IS IT FIFTY?FIFTY?
(O'Leary) THAT??SILENCE, PLEASE.
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS OFFERING,
FIFTY?FIFTY?
NO.
49?
IT'S 51/49.
WE'RE PUTTING IN??
YOU WANT THE 51, THOUGH.
YES.
(Robert)
WE'RE PUTTING IN $80,000.
I THINK OUR OFFER'S
PRETTY SIMPLE.
RODOLFO, YES OR NO?
YES.
YES.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(O'Leary)
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT.
(Robert) I DO, TOO.
(Harrington) GOOD JOB.
(Barbara) GOOD FOR YOU.
NICELY DONE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY NEED THE GUIDANCE MORE THAN
THEY REALLY NEED THE MONEY.
(Daymond)
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
I MEAN, IT WAS A SMALL AMOUNT
OF MONEY FOR ANY OF US.
(O'Leary) I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THESE GUYS.
I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.
IMAGINE THEY WERE GONNA LEAVE
BEFORE THEY MENTIONED
THAT INSURANCE DEAL.
I'M AMAZED.
I MEAN, WHY WERE THEY
HOLDING THAT BACK?
BARBARA,
THAT'S WHY THEY NEED US.
'CAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE FIRST TWO WORDS
OUT OF MY MOUTH
WHEN I WALKED OUT THERE.
YEAH.
BUT FATE INTERVENES,
AND THEY GOT A DEAL.
GREAT STORY. WONDERFUL GUYS.
THANK GOODNESS
WE CAME ON "SHARK TANK."
OUR AMERICAN DREAM
SINCE WE WERE LITTLE KIDS
TODAY BECAME A REALITY,
AND ALL THE WORK
AND SACRIFICE HAS PAID OFF.
AND NOW... WE'RE GONNA SOAR.
THANK YOU, "SHARK TANK."
THANKS. OH.
(laughs)
WHY IS THIS COMPANY
VALUED AT $1 MILLION?
THEY'RE JUST JOKING ABOUT THAT.
I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED IN V. C.
IF YOU'VE WORKED
IN VENTURE CAPITAL, THEN MY JOB
IS TO SQUEEZE YOUR HEAD LIKE
A TEENAGE PIMPLE RIGHT NOW.
I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU WITHOUT
PICTURING YOU IN A PIG COSTUME.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT OUT A NUMBER?
NO, I CAN'T NEGOTIATE
WITH MYSELF.
YOU PULL THE LEVER.
I'M GIVING YOU THE POWER.
OH, MY GOD. THIS GUY'S GREAT.
I LOVE THIS GUY.
HE IS. HE IS, RIGHT?
