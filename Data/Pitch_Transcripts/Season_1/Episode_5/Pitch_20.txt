BUT WHAT DO WE NEED
DAYMOND FOR?
YOU GONNA LET HIM
SCREW ME LIKE THAT?
(man) ? THE BEST THINGS
IN LIFE ARE FREE ?
? BUT THAT AIN'T REALLY
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ?
? I NEED MONEY ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
AND THINK
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MUCH,
AND MY ONE CLAIM TO FAME
IS I'VE NEVER HAD A JOB.
ALL I DO IS CREATE PRODUCTS
AND BRING IT TO MARKET.
I'VE INVENTED CLEANING PRODUCTS,
FISHING LURES,
ARM WRESTLING MACHINES,
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS.
I'M A COUNTRY BOY FROM IOWA.
I NEVER STARTED OUT THINKING
THAT I WAS GONNA BE
AN ENTREPRENEUR.
NOW I'VE GOT DOZENS AND DOZENS
OF PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET.
MY WIFE EMMY AND I,
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER 46 YEARS,
AND SHE'D BE THE FIRST
TO TELL YA
IT'S BEEN A PRETTY WILD RIDE.
I'VE MADE MILLIONS
AND I'VE ALSO LOST MILLIONS.
THE REASON THAT I'M LOOKING FOR
AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SHARKS
IS, VERY HONESTLY,
I'VE TAKEN MY RISKS ALL MY LIFE.
I WENT BANKRUPT YEARS AGO,
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T WANT
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.
YEAH?HA!
I'M REALLY HOPING
THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET ON BOARD.
AND I INVENTED A NEW PRODUCT
FOR FITNESS CALLED THE BODY JAC.
I'M, UH, LOOKING FOR
A $180,000 INVESTMENT,
AND I WANNA GIVE UP
20% OF THE COMPANY FOR THAT.
I WENT TO, UH, MY DOCTOR HERE
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM
WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
TO GET THE WEIGHT DOWN,
HE WANTED ME TO GO HOME
AND DO PUSH?UPS.
AND SO I WENT HOME,
GOT ON THE FLOOR,
AND STARTED DOING PUSH?UPS.
I GOT ABOUT A HALF?ONE IN,
AND I COLLAPSED.
I'M 65 YEARS OLD,
WEIGH 260 POUNDS.
AND I JUST COULDN'T
DO PUSH?UPS.
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS HAVE
MY DAUGHTER GET ON HERE QUICK,
AND WE'LL JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK
DEMONSTRATION HOW IT WORKS.
WHAT IT HAS HERE
IS A SERIES OF THESE BANDS.
AND THERE'S DIFFERENT WEIGHTS
ON THOSE THINGS.
AND SO JUST BY SIMPLY CHANGING
THE BAND SYSTEM ON THIS THING,
YOU CAN GET EITHER 100 POUNDS
OR 125, 150.
YOU WORK??
SO THE HEAVIER THE WEIGHT,
THE EASIER THE PUSH?UP?
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING OUT
ON THIS AND LOSING WEIGHT?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
THIS IS THE PROTOTYPE.
AND I FUNDED
ALL MY PROJECTS.
DID MOST OF THOSE SELL WELL?
AND WHAT DOES IT COST, OR WHAT
WOULD YOU INTEND TO SELL IT FOR?
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT FOR RIGHT
AROUND??BETWEEN $20 AND $30,
WHOLESALE OUT OF CHINA.
IT'LL COME OUT
ANYWHERE FROM $89 TO $129.
AND I ASK MYSELF,
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS?
AND THE ANSWER IS??LET'S BE
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER??NOTHING.
EVERY GUY AND HIS DOG
HAS SOMETHING
THEY WANNA SELL YOU
IN FITNESS.
WHAT MATTERS IS,
CAN YOU TIE A HUGE NAME TO IT?
CAN YOU GET
A HUGE BUDGET TO PROMOTE IT?
CAN YOU GET OUT THERE
AND GET SOME MARKET SHARE?
ALL OF THAT COSTS MONEY.
LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY.
YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE?
I HAVE DONE IT BEFORE.
HAVE YOU HAD SUCCESS?
I'VE HAD HUGE SUCCESS.
REALLY? GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.
I INVENTED THE WORLD'S FIRST
TABLET ALL?PURPOSE CLEANER.
I HAD IT MADE TO LOOK LIKE
A .45 CALIBER BULLET.
I PACKAGED IT
IN AMMUNITION BOXES.
AND I WAS FLAT BROKE
BY THE TIME I WAS 38.
THAT'S THE GAME THAT I PLAY.
I'M A RISKTAKER,
AND THE FAMILY...
HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS
ALL THEIR LIFE.
UP, DOWN, UP AND DOWN.
I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR.
I GO WITH THIS PRODUCT.
YOU'RE NOT JUST INVESTING
IN THE BODY JAC.
I SEE I HAVE ALL THE RISK,
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THE UPSIDE.
I DON'T LIKE
THOSE KIND OF DEALS.
I'M OUT.
THE DOTS DON'T CONNECT
FOR ME.
IF YOU HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY
YOU'VE TOLD US YOU HAVE,
YOU SHOULD
BE FUNDING THIS YOURSELF.
WHY GIVE UP 20% OF THE BUSINESS
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE 100% OF IT?
IT DOESN'T ADD UP FOR ME.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
IT'S HUGE. I MEAN, IT'S MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF UNITS.
AND NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO
THESE OTHER PUSH?UPS.
THIS IS WHERE
I'M WRESTLING WITH THE DEAL.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $180,000.
I COULD SEE MAKING...
A $90,000 INVESTMENT
IN THIS PROJECT.
I WANT HALF THE COMPANY.
BUT YOU NEED TO CONVINCE
ONE OTHER SHARK TO MATCH THAT
TO GET A DEAL DONE,
OR THERE IS NO DEAL.
THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT.
IT'S A CATEGORY.
I KNOW HOW TO MAKE
THESE THINGS HAPPEN,
AND I WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME A SHOT AT IT.
COULD I DO SOMETHING?
I'D LIKE TO INVEST THE $90,000,
BUT A BIG CONTINGENCY??
AND ONE I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE REALLY ABLE TO MEET??
I SEE YOU AS A GREAT SALESMAN
FOR THIS,
BUT THAT GUT IS IN THE WAY.
SO I'D LIKE
THE CONTINGENCY TO BE
THAT YOU TRY
YOUR NEW MACHINE OUT,
YOU LOSE 30 POUNDS AND TAKE
PHOTOS BEFORE AND AFTER??
LET ME GET THIS RIGHT.
THIS GUY HAS TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.
TO GET THE 90 GRAND
FROM BARBARA.
YOU LOSE 30 POUNDS AND TAKE
PHOTOS BEFORE AND AFTER.
PUT UP $90,000 APIECE??
AND YOU LOSE 30 POUNDS.
I LOSE 30 POUNDS.
AND TODAY I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
YOU ONE OF MY PRODUCTS.
IT'S CALLED FACE?BLOCK.
I'M LOOKING FOR
A $50,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE OF 30%
OF MY PRODUCT.
(Robert laughs)
SO... FACE?BLOCK IS
A COLLECTION
OF FASHION SURGICAL MASKS.
(chuckles)
AND UNINTERESTING
AS A SURGICAL MASK
AND INFUSING IT
WITH FUN AND CREATIVITY
CREATES
A REALLY UNIQUE PRODUCT.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
TRY IT ON.
I THINK I'LL PASS.
HE'S THE PERFECT GUY
FOR THIS MASK.
OH, YEAH.
IRINA, HOW DO I PUT IT ON?
JUST...
JUST PUT IT ON.
(O'Leary) DOES IT HAVE
REAL SURGICAL PROPERTIES
IN TERMS OF PROTECTING
AGAINST DISEASE?
THAT'S WHEN
THE INVESTMENT COMES IN.
(Robert chuckles)
(O'Leary) THAT'S WHEN
THE INVESTMENT COMES IN?
DOES IT WORK?
(Robert) DAYMOND,
LET ME SEE YOURS.
(laughs) LOOK AT DAYMOND.
HE'S WEARING IT WRONG.
NO?
HE NEEDS TWO.
(muffled voice)
CAN YOU TALK WITH IT ON?
(laughing)
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
HEY, LISTEN, I'M TRYING
TO MAKE SOME MONEY HERE.
TELL ME IF THIS WORKS
OR NOT.
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THESE PROTOTYPES ARE NOT MADE
FROM THE TRUE
SURGICAL MASK
THEY'RE NOT.
DESIGN POSSIBILITIES
ARE ENDLESS.
(Barbara) I'M SURE.
SO I SEE FACE?BLOCK
AT EVERY HOSPITAL.
DO YOU THINK HOSPITALS
MAY HAVE A PROBLEM
PUTTING A PIG SNOUT
ONTO A DOCTOR'S FACE?
(chuckling)
THE HEAD OF
AMERICAN PEDIATRIC BOARD
HAD CONTACTED ME
WHEN THEY SAW THIS MASK,
AND THEY SAID
THEY THINK IT'S GENIUS.
THEY WANT TO HAVE THOSE MASKS.
DO YOU HAVE ANY INTERESTS,
ANY SALES?
IN ONE WEEK
AFTER I LAUNCHED IT,
IT WAS ON FOX NEWS,
"SYDNEY MORNING HERALD,"
I HAD CLOSE TO MILLION HITS
ON MY WEB SITE.
WHOA.
YOU HAD A MILLION HITS
TO YOUR WEB SITE?
CLOSE TO. I HAD 700,000.
BUT IS THAT
BECAUSE SWINE FLU
WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS
FOR TWO WEEKS?
NOW WE DON'T SEE IT ANYMORE.
IT'S AN EPIDEMIC
THAT CAME AND WENT.
YOU NEED A NEW EPIDEMIC
TO GET THAT KIND
OF A HIT PROFILE AGAIN.
SO HOW MANY SALES DID YOU HAVE
FROM??FROM ALL THOSE HITS?
I HAD COUPLE HUNDRED OF SALES,
BUT THAT IS??
WHY ONLY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
WHEN YOU HAD??
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
A REAL SURGICAL MASK.
BUT, IRINA, THERE'S REALLY
NO COMPANY HERE.
YOU??YOU'RE BRAND?NEW. YOU JUST
STARTED. IT'S A BRAND?NEW IDEA.
(Irina) THAT'S RIGHT.
THE QUESTION IS,
IS IT A GOOD IDEA?
IN FOREIGN MARKETS, IRINA,
WHERE THEY WEAR MASKS
MORE OFTEN,
DO THEY DO DESIGNS
ON THE MASKS?
LIKE IN JAPAN, FOR EXAMPLE.
THEY DON'T,
AND I THINK THERE IS
A?A NICHE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT.
IS THIS A FASHION STATEMENT,
DAYMOND?
COULD YOU MAKE THIS HAPPEN
ON THE STREET?
NO.
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
WHY NOT?
IT'S, UH, SOMETHING
THAT THEY DON'T NORMALLY DO
IN THE UNITED STATES.
IT'S JUST DOWNRIGHT FREAKY.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M JUST OUT.
IT'S SO FREAKY.
IRINA, IT'S A NOVELTY ITEM,
NOT A SERIOUS ITEM,
AND??AND I JUST DON'T SEE
THE MARKET FOR IT.
SO ON THAT NOTE, I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA STAND WITH KEVIN
AS WELL,
AND I'M OUT
FOR THE SAME REASONS.
I?I??KEEP DOING IT
AS A SIDE BUSINESS.
DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB.
I'M OUT.
IT'S A UNIQUE IDEA.
THERE'S NO QUESTION.
BUT AS AN INVESTABLE CONCEPT,
IT'S NOT THERE. I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.
(Irina) THANK YOU.
MY TARGET AUDIENCE
ARE PEOPLE WHO DARE
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES
AND WHO HAVE
EDGY SENSE OF HUMOR,
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE SHARKS.
AND I'M FROM
STEVENSON RANCH, CALIFORNIA.
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND SNACKS THAT TASTE GOOD
THAT WON'T SPIKE
MY BLOOD SUGAR.
OKAY, SO GRAB THE OATS,
AND WE NEED 20 OUNCES OF OATS.
WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY,
WE'VE COME UP WITH A HEALTHY
GOURMET DIABETIC PRODUCT
THAT'S NOT JUST FOR DIABETICS
BUT ANYBODY INTERESTED
IN A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.
AND YUMMY.
I'VE INVESTED A LOT OF
OUR FAMILY'S HARD?EARNED MONEY
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
GO GET IT.
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR,
MY DREAM'S ALWAYS BEEN
TO DEVELOP A PRODUCT
THAT EVERYBODY LOVED
AND BRING IT TO THE MASS MARKET.
MY FAMILY'S ALL BEHIND IT.
I DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT ANYBODY.
IF I DON'T GET THE INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS,
THAT'S ALL AT RISK.
AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT
A GOURMET DIABETIC PRODUCT.
OUR PRODUCT HAS A SLOGAN.
THE SLOGAN IS...
"ENERGY BARS FOR ATHLETES,
DIABETICS &amp; YOU!"
I'VE BEEN DIABETIC
FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS
AND COULD NEVER REALLY FIND
A SNACK THAT BOTH
TASTED REALLY GOOD
AND WOULDN'T CAUSE
MY BLOOD SUGAR TO SPIKE.
OUT OF THAT,
WE CREATED GRANOLA GOURMET.
DID YOU GUYS LIKE THE BARS?
VERY NICE.
VERY GOOD.
THEY'RE ALSO REALLY GOOD
FOR YOU.
I ACTUALLY WOKE UP, AND MY WIFE
WAS MAKING SOME GREAT MUFFINS.
AND I SAID, "HEY, BABE.
IT WOULD BE SO GREAT
IF WE COULD MAKE SOMETHING THAT
I COULD ACTUALLY EAT SOMETIME."
(sharks laugh)
AND HE SAID,
"YOU KNOW, DAD, LET'S DO THAT.
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING
THAT <i>I</i> LIKE THAT <i>YOU</i> CAN EAT."
AND SO WE SPENT THAT ENTIRE
2?WEEK HOLIDAY PERIOD
LEARNING WHAT INGREDIENTS
ON THE GLYCEMIC INDEX WERE LOW.
IDENTIFYING THE FACT
THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WE COULD
MAKE A GRANOLA OUT OF THIS,
MY WIFE STARTED
EATING THESE WITH US,
AND SHE GAVE ME
THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT??
EVERY WEEK OR TWO WEEKS,
WE'RE IN REFILLING OUR RACK.
FOR A BUSINESS
THAT'S BEEN UP AND RUNNING
LESS THAN A YEAR?
GOOD FOR YOU.
WE'VE ACTUALLY
ONLY BEEN DOING IT
FOR ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS.
BUT WHY AREN'T YOU
AT OTHER STORES?
LET'S FORGET THE OTHER STORES
FOR A SECOND,
BECAUSE I LIKE YOUR APPROACH.
YOU GOT INTO WHOLE FOODS.
STEP ONE. THEY GOT BEHIND YOU.
STEP TWO.
TO ME, STEP THREE IS ROLL IT OUT
NATIONALLY TO WHOLE FOODS.
THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR SALES.
AND THEN GO TO OTHER RETAILERS
ONCE IT'S ON A NATIONAL BASIS.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT?
IT REQUIRES CASH.
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE BEEN
BOOTSTRAPPING THE COMPANY
FROM THE BEGINNING.
AND WHY HAVE YOU COME TO US
INSTEAD OF GOING TO A BANK?
I HAD A SOFTWARE COMPANY.
I HAD PERSONALLY GUARANTEED
A LOT OF LOANS
FOR THAT BUSINESS.
AFTER SIX YEARS
OF HAVING RUN IT SUCCESSFULLY,
I GOT STUCK
WITH A NUMBER OF THOSE LOANS
AFTER SELLING SOME OF THE ASSETS
OF THE FIRM AND CLOSING IT.
THAT BUSINESS WENT BANKRUPT
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
UH, I HAD A PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY
BECAUSE OF IT.
YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU $175,000,
AND I'LL GET 25%
OF YOUR COMPANY,
SO I'D CALCULATE YOUR WHOLE
COMPANY AS WORTH $700,000 NOW
WITH $80,000 A YEAR
WORTH OF SALES.
I DON'T SEE HOW
IT'S WORTH $700,000.
I AGREE
IT'S NOT WORTH $700,000.
HE'S DOING 80 TO 90 GRAND
A YEAR IN SALES.
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS RIGHT NOW??
TWO TIMES SALES??
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
FOR ME TO GIVE YOU $175,000,
I'D HAVE TO OWN
YOUR WHOLE COMPANY.
I PUT A NUMBER OUT THERE
THAT I DIDN'T THINK
WAS GONNA BE
AN OUTRAGEOUS NUMBER
BUT WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD WORK FROM TOGETHER.
I LIKE YOU. I REALLY DO,
AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE
THE TASTE OF THEM.
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I'M OUT.
OKAY.
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LOT MORE MONEY,
AND I'M NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER SEE
A RETURN ON MY INVESTMENT.
SO I WISH YOU LUCK,
BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE
A GREAT PRODUCT HERE.
BUT I'M NOT IN IT.
I'M OUT.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
IF I WAS YOUR PARTNER,
AND THE BUSINESS WAS SUCCESSFUL,
WE WOULD REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL,
AND NO BANK IS GOING
TO LOAN YOU ANY MONEY.
THAT CAUSES ME TO PUT UP
MORE CAPITAL AND MORE CAPITAL
AND MORE CAPITAL.
IT'S A FACT. YOU NEED A BANK
AT SOME POINT.
AND YOU DON'T SEEM FOCUSED
ON MAXIMIZING
ON THAT OPPORTUNITY.
ONLY FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT.
OKAY, SO THE GUY HAS
A WIFE AND KIDS,
AND YOU JUST TOLD HIM THAT
HE'S A RADIOACTIVE HUMAN BEING.
PRETTY DAMN TOUGH.
I ASKED THE GUY A QUESTION.
DID HE GO BANKRUPT?
HE SAID YES. I NOW KNOW A BANK
WILL NOT FINANCE HIM, PERIOD.
AND THEN YOU DUMPED ON HIM.
JUST??
I DIDN'T DUMP ON HIM.
I SAID I CAN'T INVEST IN HIM.
HE'S RADIOACTIVE.
HE WENT BANKRUPT.
LET THAT BE A LESSON, ROBERT.
DON'T GO BANKRUPT.
AND THERE ARE A MILLION PEOPLE
OUT THERE WHO ARE GONNA
GET THE WRONG MESSAGE
FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
NO, THEY'RE GETTING
THE <i>RIGHT</i> MESSAGE.
THEY SHOULD NOT GO BANKRUPT.
THERE'S A MILLION DEALS
IN THE NAKED CITY.
I'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS GUY
ALREADY. BRING ON THE NEXT DEAL.
I'M HERE TO MAKE MONEY.
WELL...
THE SHARKS FOCUSED WAY TOO MUCH
ON MY PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY.
THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY.
WE GET A SECOND CHANCE HERE.
IT'S JUST A SHAME THEY'RE NOT
GONNA BE PARTICIPATING IN MINE.
AND I'M THE OWNER
OF GOOD GRIEF CELEBRATIONS.
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK
THE SHARK TANK FOR $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
SO GOOD GRIEF CELEBRATIONS
IS A FUNERAL CONCIERGE SERVICE.
AS A FUNERAL CONCIERGE COMPANY,
WE'RE HAPPY TO WRITE THE EULOGY,
OFFICIATE THE FUNERAL SERVICE
AND HANDLE
ALL OF THE POST?FUNERAL
FAMILY GATHERING DETAILS.
THE CELEBRATION OF LIFE MOVEMENT
IS GAINING TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM.
WE OFFER CELEBRATION OF LIFE
PARTY PLANNING.
SHE HAD ME PLAN HER FUNERAL,
AND SHE KEPT ON SAYING
THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE
A CELEBRATION OF LIFE PARTY,
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT IT
TO BE SAD WITH A BUNCH OF TEARS.
SO I ACTUALLY PLANNED
AN AMAZING PARTY FOR HER.
WE HAD A DEEJAY.
WE HAD AN OPEN BAR
AND PEOPLE KEPT ON COMING UP TO
ME??I'M SORRY, IF I COULD JUST
ANSWER HIS QUESTION? THANK YOU.
PEOPLE KEPT ON COMING UP TO ME
TELLING ME THAT IT WAS SUCH
A GREAT IDEA AND THAT YOU SHOULD
PASSING AWAY AND PEOPLE
DRINKING AT A BAR?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
IT'S A CELEBRATION OF LIFE.
(O'Leary) ROBERT, WE IRISH
DO THAT EVERY DAY.
IRISH WAKE, YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
I LOVE THIS BUSINESS.
THANK YOU.
PEOPLE ARE DYING TO GET IN.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
LITERALLY.
THERE'S NEVER A BETTER TIME
TO UPSELL
THAN WHEN A FAMILY
IS STRICKEN WITH GRIEF,
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY
LOOKING AT THE MARGINS ANYMORE.
THAT FITS YOU SO WELL.
THAT SOUNDS
SO MUCH LIKE YOU.
BARBARA,
I'M DEALING WITH FACTS.
THIS IS WHY THE FUNERAL BUSINESS
IS WONDERFUL??
LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIENTS.
THE PROBLEM IS,
EVERYTHING YOU'VE LISTED,
WITH THE EXCEPTION, PERHAPS,
OF THE PARTY CELEBRATION
PLANNING,
IS INCORPORATED INTO MOST
FUNERAL HOME BUSINESS MODELS.
TELL ME WHY YOU THINK
YOU CAN COMPETE
WITH EVERY FUNERAL HOME WHEN YOU
DON'T HAVE ONE YOURSELF.
AND THAT'S WHY YOUR SALES
ARE SO LOW.
THE REASON WHY MY SALES ARE
SO LOW IS BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE.
AND HE'S UPSELLING ME
LIKE CRAZY. WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU'RE NOWHERE. YOU'RE NOT
EVEN INSIDE THAT ROOM,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
IN THE FUNERAL PARLOR.
THE BODIES ALWAYS GO THERE
FIRST. THEY DON'T COME TO YOU.
YOU HAVE NO DEAD GUY MAGNET.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I ACTUALLY USE
TO ATTRACT CLIENTS??
I HAVE A THERAPY DOG,
AND WE VISIT HOSPICE
AND NURSING HOMES.
AND AS PEOPLE DIE??
YOU WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO DIE?
THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS
THAT WE GET BUSINESS, YES.
(Robert) OH, COME ON.
DOES HE KIND OF SMELL
WHO'S ABOUT TO CROAK?
I WISH HE COULD. THAT WOULD
MAKE IT A LOT EASIER.
DO YOU NOT THINK YOU'RE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
YOU'RE GOING OUT
TO PEOPLE WITH A DOG
TO MAKE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE...
RIGHT.
SO YOU CAN SIGN
THEIR FAMILY UP FOR THIS DEAL?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH
IT. SHE'S NOT CHARGING FOR IT.
KEVIN, KEVIN. KEVIN,
JUST SHUT UP FOR A SEC.
NO. THERE'S NO MONEY IN IT.
NO, NO, NO.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW YOU DON'T
GIVE A CRAP, BUT??
I DO GIVE A CRAP. SHE'S MAKING
NO MARGIN ON THE DOG.
(Robert) THERE'S A MORE
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
WITH THIS PRESENTATION.
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN FRONT
OF PEOPLE IN THEIR MOMENT
OF NEED...
ABSOLUTELY.
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THEIR GRIEF.
NO, I'M TRYING TO GET BUSINESS.
(O'Leary) LIKE EVERY FUNERAL
HOME DOES, ROBERT, EVERY DAY.
EXACTLY.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE.
(Robert) I THINK SHE'S A SLICK
BUSINESSWOMAN, AND I THINK,
DEEP DOWN, SHE KNOWS SHE'S
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE.
AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DO, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN BUSINESS WITH YOU
FOR THAT REASON.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
AND I THINK IT'S
A 1?MAN BUSINESS.
I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT
EXPANDABLE FOR YOU.
OKAY.
SO I'M OUT.
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE
WOULD THINK OF THE BUSINESS?
IF MY MOTHER WAS ALIVE,
I HONESTLY WOULDN'T BE HERE
IN BUSINESS TODAY,
BECAUSE MY BUSINESS
IS A TRIBUTE TO HER.
I THINK HER LOOKING DOWN ON ME
RIGHT NOW,
SHE IS SO IMPRESSED AND AMAZED
AND VERY, VERY PROUD OF ME.
SO ROBERT IS ACTUALLY WRONG
IN THINKING THAT YOU'RE
JUST TRYING TO MANIPULATE
AND COME IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT FACT THAT
SOMEBODY'S GRIEVING?
IT'S NOT ABOUT MANIPULATING
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE AT ALL.
SOMEBODY HAS TO OFFICIATE
THE FUNERAL SERVICE.
SO WHY NOT US?
THE BOTTOM LINE
IS THE MONEY HERE.
AT $11,000 IN SALES...
I DON'T SEE MARGINS.
I DON'T SEE PROFIT IN THERE.
BUT I THINK THAT YOU DID
A COMMENDABLE JOB
OF PRESENTING IT TO US
AND GIVING US ALL THE FACTS,
BUT I'M OUT.
AND THAT'S REALLY NOT
THE BUSINESS I WANT TO BE IN...
OKAY.
SO I'M OUT ALSO.
I LOOKED FOR EVERY WAY POSSIBLE
TO FIND A REASON
TO INVEST IN YOU,
'CAUSE I LIKE DEATH.
IT'S INEVITABLE.
THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
AND THAT REASON ONLY,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
HI, I'M RODOLFO SACCOMAN.
AND I'M ALEXIS SACCOMAN,
AND WE'RE BROTHERS
ORIGINALLY FROM BRAZIL.
I'M A THERAPIST,
AND I HAVE A PRIVATE PRACTICE
IN SAN FRANCISCO.
I'M DIRECTOR
OF ONLINE MARKETING
FOR A MAJOR RESORT
IN PALM BEACH, FLORIDA.
WE COMBINED BOTH
OF OUR EXPERTISE
TO CREATE
AN INNOVATIVE BUSINESS
THAT HAS TONS
OF MONEYMAKING POTENTIAL,
BUT ALSO,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY EVEN,
TO HELP PEOPLE.
WE STARTED IN BRAZIL
AND WERE THERE
PRETTY MUCH UNTIL THE AGE
OF 6 AND THE AGE OF 10.
RIGHT.
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN MY FATHER
MADE HIS BIG BREAK.
HE STARTED AS A FACTORY WORKER
IN BRAZIL.
WORKING HIS WAY
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,
THEN COLLEGE
AND THEN TWO MASTER'S DEGREE.
HE KNEW THAT HE WANTED ALEXIS
AND MYSELF TO LEARN ENGLISH,
BECAUSE IF WE LEARNED ENGLISH,
EVENTUALLY WE COULD GET
TO THE U. S.
AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SHARKS
WILL JUSTIFY
OUR PARENTS' SACRIFICE??
OVER 14 YEARS SINCE
I LANDED IN THE U. S.??
TO CREATE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL,
AND FINALLY WE CAN TASTE
A BIT OF THIS AMERICAN DREAM.
HELLO. MY NAME
IS RODOLFO SACCOMAN.
AND I AM ALEXIS SACCOMAN.
WE'RE THE FOUNDERS AND CREATORS
OF OUR WEB SITE??
MY THERAPY JOURNAL.
TODAY WE'RE HERE
TO ASK $80,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR BUSINESS.
NOW IF YOU'LL
PLEASE INDULGE US
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES
FOR FIVE SECONDS?
THINK OF SOMETHING
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD...
SOMETHING THAT
MAKES YOU HAPPY.
$10 MILLION.
(laughs)
(Rodolfo) OKAY.
PLEASE OPEN YOUR EYES.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
IN BUSINESS FOR??
TO GIVE THAT FEELING
TO MORE PEOPLE MORE OFTEN
AND IN MORE PLACES.
WE ARE
REVOLUTIONIZING THERAPY.
WHAT MY THERAPY JOURNAL
OFFERS
IS AN ONLINE
PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TOOL.
WE PROVIDE THE MOST EFFECTIVE
AND AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVE
TO TRADITIONAL THERAPY.
SO, ALEXIS, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PROVIDE AND SHARE
A LITTLE BIT OF
WHAT OUR SOFTWARE DOES?
SURE. CURRENTLY, THE ENTIRE
WEB SITE IS DATA?DRIVEN.
SO FAR, THE COMPANY
HAS TWO COMPONENTS??
THE FIRST IS JOURNALING
THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO POUR YOUR HEART OUT
IN THE MOST SECURE
OF ONLINE JOURNALS.
THE SECOND COMPONENT
IS THE PROGRESS QUESTIONS
AND THE PROGRESS GRAPH.
IT ALLOWS YOU TO TRACK
ANY EMOTION, BEHAVIOR...
MM?HMM.
DIAGNOSIS, PROBLEM,
AMBITION, HOBBY??
IT ALLOWS YOU TO TRACK
ANYTHING YOU WANT,
AND IT GRAPHS IT FOR YOU
IN A LINE GRAPH
SO THAT EVERY TIME YOU LOG ON,
YOU GET TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING TODAY
AS COMPARED TO LAST WEEK,
LAST MONTH OR LAST YEAR.
OKAY, THAT'S WONDERFUL,
BUT HOW DO I MAKE <i>MONEY</i>
OFF DEPRESSED PEOPLE?
WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE
THAT HAVE SIGNED UP.
WE HAVE PAYING CUSTOMERS. THIS,
AGAIN, IS MAKING MONEY TODAY.
THERE'S NO OVERHEAD COST.
WHAT ARE THEY PAYING?
IF THEY SIGN UP FOR A FULL YEAR,
IT IS $7.95 PER MONTH.
IF THEY DO A 3?MONTH PERIOD,
THEN IT'S $11.95 PER MONTH,
AND IF THEY JUST DO
ON A MONTH?BY?MONTH BASIS,
IT IS $14.95.
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU GROSSED THIS YEAR?
LAST YEAR
WE DID ABOUT $4,000.
BUT DIDN'T YOU JUST
SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT A THOUSAND MEMBERS?
WE HAVE??YES. THIS IS HOW
THE SYSTEM WORKS??
NOT PAYING MEMBERS.
1,120, AS OF TODAY,
HAVE SIGNED UP
FOR A FREE TRIAL.
IT'S A 14?DAY FREE TRIAL.
OKAY. I UNDERSTAND.
AFTER THE 14?DAY FREE TRIAL,
THEY HAVE AN OPTION
TO BUY A SUBSCRIPTION.
HOW MANY PEOPLE
TURNED OVER TO BUYING?
10% OF THOSE FOLKS
BECOME A PAYING CUSTOMER.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HIT THE SITE?
WE HAD ABOUT 18,000 PEOPLE
HIT THE SITE.
YOU KNOW THAT'S LOW, RODOLFO.
I COMPLETELY AGREE
THAT IT IS LOW,
THE AMOUNT OF VISITORS
WE HAVE HAD.
WE HAVE INVESTED $125,000
OF OUR LIFE'S SAVINGS
TO CREATE THIS.
95% OF THOSE FUNDS WENT
TO DEVELOP THE SOFTWARE.
WE DIDN'T HAVE THOSE FUNDS
FOR ADVERTISING.
WE DON'T HAVE A P. R. AGENCY.
THE WAY WE HAVE DONE IT
MOSTLY IS WORD OF MOUTH.
I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD
HOW MANY PAYING USERS YOU HAVE.
I THINK AROUND 121 PAYING.
IS NOT VERY MUCH.
THE PERCENTAGE??
I JUST WANT TO PAUSE
FOR A MOMENT IF I MIGHT.
YES.
YES.
I LIKE YOU, BUT I SURE DON'T
LIKE THIS BUSINESS IDEA,
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
GUYS,
WITH 120 PAYING CUSTOMERS,
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE FOR ME.
I?I'M GONNA BOW OUT AND??
LET ME SAY THAT
THIS IS...
THANK YOU.
THE INFANCY.
I'M OUT.
THIS IS THE INFANCY
OF THIS WEB SITE.
WE'RE CURRENTLY
IN THIRD STAGE CONVERSATIONS
WITH AETNA,
THE INSURANCE COMPANY.
THEY HAVE 37 MILLION
PEOPLE WITH??
TELL US ABOUT THAT.
(Robert)
SEE, THAT'S INTERESTING.
THAT'S INTERESTING. NOW YOU'VE
GOT MY JUICES FLOWING.
SURE. WE GOT CONNECTED
TO SOME FOLKS THAT SAW
THE POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCT
IN AN INSURANCE WORLD.
SO, RODOLFO,
NOW YOU'RE INTERESTING.
OKAY.
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT...
OKAY.
YOU HAD INSIGNIFICANT USERS.
OKAY.
FRANKLY, THE SITE...
REALLY INSIGNIFICANT.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
IT'S REALLY AN ONLINE JOURNAL.
BUT WHO CARES?
IF YOU CAN GET
A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY...
YEAH, YEAH. I GET THE JOKE.
I GET THE JOKE.
TO PROMOTE THIS AS PART
OF GET?WELL THERAPY,
WELL, MY FRIENDS,
MY FELLOW IMMIGRANT FRIENDS...
RIGHT.
RIGHT.
WE'RE ON TO SOMETHING.
IT'S VERY CLEAR.
A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY
SIGNS UP...
CORRECT.
PROVIDES THIS TO THEIR MEMBERS??
IN FACT, BETTER SCENARIO??
THEY FORCE THEIR MEMBERS
TO GET INSURANCE TO LOG ON.
EVERYBODY HAS TO PAY YOU
A CERTAIN FEE.
LET ME THROW OUT
AN IDEA TO YOU.
YES.
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU $80,000
FOR 50%?
OKAY.
IS IT CONTINGENT ON AETNA?
BECAUSE I'D BE INTERESTED
IN POTENTIALLY COMING IN
FOR MAYBE EVEN MORE MONEY,
BUT TO ME,
THE COMPANY HAS NO VALUE??
UNTIL THE AETNA DEAL.
NO VALUE... OR ANY OTHER
SIMILAR INSURANCE COMPANY.
I'D WANT TO??
I'D BE WILLING
TO PARTNER WITH YOU,
BECAUSE I THINK THE POTENTIAL
IS VERY INTERESTING.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU STARTED
THE PRESENTATION,
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER
INTERNET BIRDBRAIN IDEA.
LOTS OF THOSE ARE OUT THERE.
YOU GUYS
ARE NOT CRAZY CHICKENS.
GUYS, I WANT IN ON THIS.
SO, RODOLFO,
HERE'S THE OFFER,
AND, UH, DAYMOND AND KEVIN??
$80,000 FOR 51%
OF THE BUSINESS.
THAT'S THE OFFER.
GENTLEMEN, DID YOU NOTICE THAT
SUBTLE CHANGE THAT HAPPENED
IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES?
WHO ARE YOU?
I JUST WANT TO BRING
YOUR ATTENTION TO IT.
ARE YOU THE OFFER MAKER?
BARBARA. BARB. BARB.
CAN WE HELP YOU?
WHO'S THIS?
I THOUGHT I HAD HEARD 50%.
(Robert) I HEAR A VOICE...
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M HEARING 51%.
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYBODY.
DID YOU CATCH THAT LITTLE 1%?
YEP.
WE'RE CATCHING EVERYTHING.
(Alexis) YES. (laughs)
RODOLFO, MY FRIEND KEVIN
MADE A SUBTLE MISTAKE.
BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALLY NEED,
ALONG WITH THE MONEY,
IS YOU NEED SOME GUIDANCE.
YES.
AND BETWEEN MR. BILLIONAIRE
SELLER OF SOFTWARE BUSINESS
AND MR. INTERNET OVER HERE,
I THINK THAT THERE IS
A TREMENDOUS VALUE ON THAT.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
BETTER PARTNERS.
LISTEN, COULD WE TAKE
A MOMENT? OKAY?
TAKE A MOMENT. TAKE A MOMENT.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
ROBERT?
YEP.
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK OF ME AS COLD.

OF YOU THAT WAY, KEVIN.
WHAT DO WE NEED DAYMOND FOR?
HOW ABOUT WE GO IN THERE,
AND AGAIN,
WE WANT TO MAKE
THIS REALISTIC.
YEAH.
WE GO 49%, BECAUSE WE??
WELL, WHAT??WHAT IF
THEY LOSE PATIENCE
AND THEN GO, "I'M OUT,
I'M OUT, I'M OUT"?
I THINK WE HAVE TO THROW
DAYMOND UNDER A BUS.
YOU GONNA LET HIM
SCREW ME LIKE THAT?
I'M NOT SCREWING YOU.
IT'S ONLY FOR BUSINESS, DAYMOND.
HE DOESN'T
NEED YOU IN IT, THOUGH.
HE DOES, UNLESS HE WANTS
TO PAY TEN TIMES MORE.
IF WE KEEP 49%,
I TRUST THAT THEM PLUS US
IS GONNA GROW THIS SO BIG.
CORRECT.
SEE?
OKAY. (makes whooshing noise)

LET'S DO IT.
(speaks foreign language)
YEAH.
OKAY.
HERE'S OUR SUGGESTION.
HOW ABOUT WE GO 49%/51%?
TO US?
NO, WE KEEP 51%.
YOU KEEP 49%.
BUT WE, WORKING SO HARD
AND BELIEVING IN THIS,
WE REALLY WOULD ENJOY US
KEEPING 51% AND YOU 49%.
AND WE KNOW THAT YOUR EXPERTISE
IS GONNA MAKE OUR VISION
GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
LIKE, THE FIVE OF US
TOGETHER ARE GONNA??
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I HAVE BAD NEWS FOR YOU.
WHILE YOU WERE OUT
OF THE ROOM...
OKAY.
DAYMOND GOT RUN OVER BY A BUS.
HE'S NO LONGER PART OF THIS.
I'M NO LONGER PART
OF <i>THEIR</i> DEAL.
OKAY.
(Alexis)
YOU'RE A SEPARATE DEAL?
YEAH.
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE DON'T NEED HIM.
HE DOESN'T BRING
ANYTHING TO THE TABLE.
I BRING $120,000
TO YOU.
AT 51% FOR YOU?
FIFTY?FIFTY.
ALEXIS, HERE'S WHAT
I'M GONNA TELL YOU.
KEVIN IS RIGHT. DAYMOND ADDS
NO VALUE TO THIS DEAL.
HE'S NEVER DONE A DEAL
ON THE INTERNET.
WHO'S TRYING TO DO CASH, BABY?
AND HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA SAY
TO YOU ABOUT YOUR 49/51.

THAT MATTER,
WHICH ONE OF US HAVE EVER BUILT
AND SOLD AN INTERNET COMPANY

WITH TWO GUYS
THAT HAVE MADE
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS...

IN THE INTERNET?
GO FOR THIS ONE.
DID YOU COME TO THIS COUNTRY
TO HAVE SOMEBODY CONTROL
YOUR BUSINESS?

WHY DAYMOND IS STILL TALKING,
'CAUSE AS I??
I'M JUST??LISTEN, THESE GUYS
COULD BE MY POTENTIAL PARTNERS,
AND YOU ARE TRYING??

AN OFFER ON THE TABLE?
YES.

$120,000, FIFTY?FIFTY.

NICELY DONE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY NEED THE GUIDANCE MORE THAN
THEY REALLY NEED THE MONEY.
(Daymond)
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
I MEAN, IT WAS A SMALL AMOUNT
OF MONEY FOR ANY OF US.
(O'Leary) I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THESE GUYS.
I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.
IMAGINE THEY WERE GONNA LEAVE
BEFORE THEY MENTIONED
THAT INSURANCE DEAL.
I'M AMAZED.
I MEAN, WHY WERE THEY
HOLDING THAT BACK?
BARBARA,
THAT'S WHY THEY NEED US.
'CAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE FIRST TWO WORDS
OUT OF MY MOUTH
WHEN I WALKED OUT THERE.
YEAH.
BUT FATE INTERVENES,
AND THEY GOT A DEAL.
GREAT STORY. WONDERFUL GUYS.
THANK GOODNESS

AND NOW... WE'RE GONNA SOAR.
THANK YOU, "SHARK TANK."
THANKS. OH.
(laughs)
WHY IS THIS COMPANY
VALUED AT $1 MILLION?
THEY'RE JUST JOKING ABOUT THAT.
I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED IN V. C.
IF YOU'VE WORKED
IN VENTURE CAPITAL, THEN MY JOB
IS TO SQUEEZE YOUR HEAD LIKE
A TEENAGE PIMPLE RIGHT NOW.
I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU WITHOUT
PICTURING YOU IN A PIG COSTUME.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT OUT A NUMBER?
NO, I CAN'T NEGOTIATE
WITH MYSELF.
YOU PULL THE LEVER.
I'M GIVING YOU THE POWER.
OH, MY GOD. THIS GUY'S GREAT.
I LOVE THIS GUY.
HE IS. HE IS, RIGHT?
