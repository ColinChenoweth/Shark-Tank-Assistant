HOWDY! I'M CACTUS JACK!
WELCOME TO IOWA!
THIS IS WHERE MY HEART IS.
YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT LOOK AROUND HERE
BUT IN THE WORLD
CACTUS JACK LIVES IN,
TOO MUCH ISN'T EVEN
A GOOD START.
MY NAME IS JACK BARRINGER.
EVERYBODY CALLS ME CACTUS JACK.
I'M 65 YEARS OLD.
MY NAME'S CACTUS JACK.
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER KELLY.
SHE'S A PERSONAL FITNESS
TRAINER.
EXACTLY.
JACK, YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS LIKE
SHE DOESN'T REALLY NEED
MUCH OF A WORKOUT,
BUT YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED A WORKOUT.
JACK, ARE YOU PLANNING ON BEING
THE PITCHMAN FOR THIS DEVICE?
NO. NO, WE WILL...
(O'Leary laughs)
DO I LOOK LIKE A... (chuckles)
(O'Leary) NO.
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
(laughs) NO.
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS? ARE THEY
PATENTS? IS THAT WHAT YOU GOT?
YES. ALL OF THESE
ARE PATENTS OF MINE,
VERY WELL.
JACK, WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO PRODUCE THAT,
JACK, I SEE ANOTHER
WORKOUT DEVICE ON THE FLOOR.
ALONG WITH
ALL THE OTHERS I'VE SEEN,
I CALLED IT
CACTUS JACK'S 1?SHOT.
DID YOU SELL ANY?
I'VE SOLD
TEN MILLION OF 'EM.
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU MAKE?
SEVERAL MILLION.
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE
ASKING FOR $180,000
IF YOU MADE SEVERAL MILLION?
WELL, I'VE TAKEN MY RISKS.
I WAS A MILLIONAIRE
BY THE TIME I WAS 32 YEARS OLD,
I WANT YOU TO INVEST
IN CACTUS JACK,
AND I HOPE ONE OF YOU DECIDE
TO HELP US WITH IT.
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW, JACK,
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PARTNERS
IN MY LIFE, DONE A LOT OF DEALS.
BUT I'VE LEARNED ONE LESSON
THAT MATTERS??
YOUR PARTNER HAS TO HAVE
SKIN IN THE GAME,
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS IS MONEY.
I HAVE $27,000 IN THE GAME.
YEAH, BUT YOU WANT $180,000.
THAT RATIO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
(Harrington) UM, CACTUS,
I LOVE THE FITNESS CATEGORY.
HE'S GOTTA LOSE
THE CACTUS JACK GUT
CACTUS, I'M IN FOR $90,000.
BARBARA'S IN FOR $90,000.
WE OWN 50% OF THE COMPANY.
YOU HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
CACTUS, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M INTERESTED
IN THE CACTUS JACK COMPANY.
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THAT ONE PIECE
BECAUSE THEN YOU COME OUT
WITH A PILL TOMORROW
AND A BETTER PILLOW
THE NEXT DAY, AND I??
I MAY NOT HAVE
NONE OF THAT.
I WANT TO BE
IN THE CACTUS JACK BUSINESS.
I WILL GIVE YOU THE $180,000
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY,
BUT I WANT 50%
OF EVERYTHING UP THERE AS WELL.
NOW WHY WOULD HE TAKE THAT DEAL,
DAYMOND? IT MAKES NO SENSE.
'CAUSE WITH <i>MY</i> DEAL, HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.
CACTUS, I NEED AN ANSWER,
OR I'M GONNA TAKE MY OFFER
OFF THE TABLE.
I NEED AN ANSWER
ON MY OFFER.
WHICH WAS
THAT THE TWO OF YOU
CACTUS JACK, HE'S YOUR MAN.
IF HE CAN'T DO IT,
NO ONE CAN.
(laughs)
YOU'RE ON!
I'LL TAKE YOUR DEAL.
(Barbara) WHOO!
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. GOOD JOB.
GIVE ME A HIGH.
GIVE ME A LOW.
(Barbara laughs)
WE'LL GET IT BACK.
LET'S GO MAKE SOME DOUGH.
(O'Leary)
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU GUYS.
THERE'S NOT A CHANCE IN HELL
HE'S LOSING 30 POUNDS.
THIS DEAL'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU
MY SKINNY CACTUS JACK.
YEAH. LET'S SEE THAT.
MY DAD INFLUENCED ME
WITH BUT ONE QUOTE.
HE SAID, "YOU CAN TRADE HOURS
FOR DOLLARS,
OR YOU CAN TRADE IDEAS
FOR MILLIONS."
GUESS WHICH ONE I CHOSE.
MICHAEL JACKSON HAD ONE,
RICHARD PRYOR HAD ONE,
