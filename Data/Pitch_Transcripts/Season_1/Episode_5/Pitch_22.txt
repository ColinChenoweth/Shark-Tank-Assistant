HOWDY! I'M CACTUS JACK!
WELCOME TO IOWA!
THIS IS WHERE MY HEART IS.
YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT LOOK AROUND HERE
AND THINK
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MUCH,
BUT IN THE WORLD
CACTUS JACK LIVES IN,
TOO MUCH ISN'T EVEN
A GOOD START.
MY NAME IS JACK BARRINGER.
EVERYBODY CALLS ME CACTUS JACK.
I'M 65 YEARS OLD.
AND MY ONE CLAIM TO FAME
IS I'VE NEVER HAD A JOB.
ALL I DO IS CREATE PRODUCTS
AND BRING IT TO MARKET.
I'VE INVENTED CLEANING PRODUCTS,
FISHING LURES,
ARM WRESTLING MACHINES,
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS.
I'M A COUNTRY BOY FROM IOWA.
I NEVER STARTED OUT THINKING
THAT I WAS GONNA BE
AN ENTREPRENEUR.
NOW I'VE GOT DOZENS AND DOZENS
OF PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET.
MY WIFE EMMY AND I,
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER 46 YEARS,
AND SHE'D BE THE FIRST
TO TELL YA
IT'S BEEN A PRETTY WILD RIDE.
I'VE MADE MILLIONS
AND I'VE ALSO LOST MILLIONS.
THE REASON THAT I'M LOOKING FOR
AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SHARKS
IS, VERY HONESTLY,
I'VE TAKEN MY RISKS ALL MY LIFE.
I WENT BANKRUPT YEARS AGO,
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T WANT
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.
YEAH?HA!
I'M REALLY HOPING
THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET ON BOARD.
MY NAME'S CACTUS JACK.
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER KELLY.
SHE'S A PERSONAL FITNESS
TRAINER.
AND I INVENTED A NEW PRODUCT
FOR FITNESS CALLED THE BODY JAC.
I'M, UH, LOOKING FOR
A $180,000 INVESTMENT,
AND I WANNA GIVE UP
20% OF THE COMPANY FOR THAT.
I WENT TO, UH, MY DOCTOR HERE
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM
WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
TO GET THE WEIGHT DOWN,
HE WANTED ME TO GO HOME
AND DO PUSH?UPS.
AND SO I WENT HOME,
GOT ON THE FLOOR,
AND STARTED DOING PUSH?UPS.
I GOT ABOUT A HALF?ONE IN,
AND I COLLAPSED.
I'M 65 YEARS OLD,
WEIGH 260 POUNDS.
AND I JUST COULDN'T
DO PUSH?UPS.
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS HAVE
MY DAUGHTER GET ON HERE QUICK,
AND WE'LL JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK
DEMONSTRATION HOW IT WORKS.
WHAT IT HAS HERE
IS A SERIES OF THESE BANDS.
AND THERE'S DIFFERENT WEIGHTS
ON THOSE THINGS.
AND SO JUST BY SIMPLY CHANGING
THE BAND SYSTEM ON THIS THING,
YOU CAN GET EITHER 100 POUNDS
OR 125, 150.
YOU WORK??
SO THE HEAVIER THE WEIGHT,
THE EASIER THE PUSH?UP?
EXACTLY.
JACK, YOUR DAUGHTER LOOKS LIKE
SHE DOESN'T REALLY NEED
MUCH OF A WORKOUT,
BUT YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED A WORKOUT.
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING OUT
ON THIS AND LOSING WEIGHT?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
THIS IS THE PROTOTYPE.
JACK, ARE YOU PLANNING ON BEING
THE PITCHMAN FOR THIS DEVICE?
NO. NO, WE WILL...
(O'Leary laughs)
DO I LOOK LIKE A... (chuckles)
(O'Leary) NO.
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
(laughs) NO.
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS? ARE THEY
PATENTS? IS THAT WHAT YOU GOT?
YES. ALL OF THESE
ARE PATENTS OF MINE,
AND I FUNDED
ALL MY PROJECTS.
DID MOST OF THOSE SELL WELL?
VERY WELL.
JACK, WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO PRODUCE THAT,
AND WHAT DOES IT COST, OR WHAT
WOULD YOU INTEND TO SELL IT FOR?
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT FOR RIGHT
AROUND??BETWEEN $20 AND $30,
WHOLESALE OUT OF CHINA.
IT'LL COME OUT
ANYWHERE FROM $89 TO $129.
JACK, I SEE ANOTHER
WORKOUT DEVICE ON THE FLOOR.
ALONG WITH
ALL THE OTHERS I'VE SEEN,
AND I ASK MYSELF,
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS?
AND THE ANSWER IS??LET'S BE
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER??NOTHING.
EVERY GUY AND HIS DOG
HAS SOMETHING
THEY WANNA SELL YOU
IN FITNESS.
WHAT MATTERS IS,
CAN YOU TIE A HUGE NAME TO IT?
CAN YOU GET
A HUGE BUDGET TO PROMOTE IT?
CAN YOU GET OUT THERE
AND GET SOME MARKET SHARE?
ALL OF THAT COSTS MONEY.
LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY.
YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE?
I HAVE DONE IT BEFORE.
HAVE YOU HAD SUCCESS?
I'VE HAD HUGE SUCCESS.
REALLY? GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.
I INVENTED THE WORLD'S FIRST
TABLET ALL?PURPOSE CLEANER.
I HAD IT MADE TO LOOK LIKE
A .45 CALIBER BULLET.
I PACKAGED IT
IN AMMUNITION BOXES.
I CALLED IT
CACTUS JACK'S 1?SHOT.
DID YOU SELL ANY?
I'VE SOLD
TEN MILLION OF 'EM.
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU MAKE?
SEVERAL MILLION.
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE
ASKING FOR $180,000
IF YOU MADE SEVERAL MILLION?
WELL, I'VE TAKEN MY RISKS.
I WAS A MILLIONAIRE
BY THE TIME I WAS 32 YEARS OLD,
AND I WAS FLAT BROKE
BY THE TIME I WAS 38.
THAT'S THE GAME THAT I PLAY.
I'M A RISKTAKER,
AND THE FAMILY...
HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS
ALL THEIR LIFE.
UP, DOWN, UP AND DOWN.
I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR.
I GO WITH THIS PRODUCT.
YOU'RE NOT JUST INVESTING
IN THE BODY JAC.
I WANT YOU TO INVEST
IN CACTUS JACK,
AND I HOPE ONE OF YOU DECIDE
TO HELP US WITH IT.
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW, JACK,
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PARTNERS
IN MY LIFE, DONE A LOT OF DEALS.
BUT I'VE LEARNED ONE LESSON
THAT MATTERS??
YOUR PARTNER HAS TO HAVE
SKIN IN THE GAME,
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS IS MONEY.
I HAVE $27,000 IN THE GAME.
YEAH, BUT YOU WANT $180,000.
THAT RATIO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
I SEE I HAVE ALL THE RISK,
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THE UPSIDE.
I DON'T LIKE
THOSE KIND OF DEALS.
I'M OUT.
THE DOTS DON'T CONNECT
FOR ME.
IF YOU HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY
YOU'VE TOLD US YOU HAVE,
YOU SHOULD
BE FUNDING THIS YOURSELF.
WHY GIVE UP 20% OF THE BUSINESS
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE 100% OF IT?
IT DOESN'T ADD UP FOR ME.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
(Harrington) UM, CACTUS,
I LOVE THE FITNESS CATEGORY.
IT'S HUGE. I MEAN, IT'S MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF UNITS.
AND NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO
THESE OTHER PUSH?UPS.
THIS IS WHERE
I'M WRESTLING WITH THE DEAL.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $180,000.
I COULD SEE MAKING...
A $90,000 INVESTMENT
IN THIS PROJECT.
I WANT HALF THE COMPANY.
BUT YOU NEED TO CONVINCE
ONE OTHER SHARK TO MATCH THAT
TO GET A DEAL DONE,
OR THERE IS NO DEAL.
THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT.
IT'S A CATEGORY.
I KNOW HOW TO MAKE
THESE THINGS HAPPEN,
AND I WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME A SHOT AT IT.
COULD I DO SOMETHING?
I'D LIKE TO INVEST THE $90,000,
BUT A BIG CONTINGENCY??
AND ONE I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE REALLY ABLE TO MEET??
I SEE YOU AS A GREAT SALESMAN
FOR THIS,
BUT THAT GUT IS IN THE WAY.
SO I'D LIKE
THE CONTINGENCY TO BE
THAT YOU TRY
YOUR NEW MACHINE OUT,
YOU LOSE 30 POUNDS AND TAKE
PHOTOS BEFORE AND AFTER??
LET ME GET THIS RIGHT.
THIS GUY HAS TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.
HE'S GOTTA LOSE
THE CACTUS JACK GUT
TO GET THE 90 GRAND
FROM BARBARA.
CACTUS, I'M IN FOR $90,000.
BARBARA'S IN FOR $90,000.
WE OWN 50% OF THE COMPANY.
YOU HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
CACTUS, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M INTERESTED
IN THE CACTUS JACK COMPANY.
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THAT ONE PIECE
BECAUSE THEN YOU COME OUT
WITH A PILL TOMORROW
AND A BETTER PILLOW
THE NEXT DAY, AND I??
I MAY NOT HAVE
NONE OF THAT.
I WANT TO BE
IN THE CACTUS JACK BUSINESS.
I WILL GIVE YOU THE $180,000
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY,
BUT I WANT 50%
OF EVERYTHING UP THERE AS WELL.
NOW WHY WOULD HE TAKE THAT DEAL,
DAYMOND? IT MAKES NO SENSE.
'CAUSE WITH <i>MY</i> DEAL, HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.
CACTUS, I NEED AN ANSWER,
OR I'M GONNA TAKE MY OFFER
OFF THE TABLE.
I NEED AN ANSWER
ON MY OFFER.
WHICH WAS
THAT THE TWO OF YOU
PUT UP $90,000 APIECE??
AND YOU LOSE 30 POUNDS.
I LOSE 30 POUNDS.
CACTUS JACK, HE'S YOUR MAN.
IF HE CAN'T DO IT,
NO ONE CAN.
(laughs)
YOU'RE ON!
I'LL TAKE YOUR DEAL.
(Barbara) WHOO!
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. GOOD JOB.
GIVE ME A HIGH.
GIVE ME A LOW.
(Barbara laughs)
WE'LL GET IT BACK.
LET'S GO MAKE SOME DOUGH.
(O'Leary)
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU GUYS.
THERE'S NOT A CHANCE IN HELL
HE'S LOSING 30 POUNDS.
THIS DEAL'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU
MY SKINNY CACTUS JACK.
YEAH. LET'S SEE THAT.
MY DAD INFLUENCED ME
WITH BUT ONE QUOTE.
HE SAID, "YOU CAN TRADE HOURS
FOR DOLLARS,
OR YOU CAN TRADE IDEAS
FOR MILLIONS."
GUESS WHICH ONE I CHOSE.
MICHAEL JACKSON HAD ONE,
RICHARD PRYOR HAD ONE,
