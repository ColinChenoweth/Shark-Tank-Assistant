HI. MY NAME IS RIKKI FARRAR,
BERNIE MAC, MY MOTHER AS WELL.
RIKKI, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
YES, I'VE HAD, LAST YEAR,
$11,000 IN SALES.
THAT'S IT?
YES.
RIKKI, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?
I ACTUALLY CAME UP
WITH THIS IDEA
WHEN MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY
TWO YEARS AGO.
THAT SERVED
HER FAVORITE DRINKS.
(Harrington) RIKKI??
THINK ABOUT TURNING IT
INTO A BUSINESS.
(Robert) RIKKI, YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH YOUR MOM
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT CELEBRANTS EXIST.
OKAY, RIKKI, LET'S ROLE?PLAY.
SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY JUST DIED.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU EXIST.
RIGHT.
I'M SITTING DOWN
WITH THE DIRECTOR SAYING,
"I'M STRICKEN WITH GRIEF.
HELP ME GET THROUGH THIS."
LET ME ASK SOMETHING, RIKKI.
IS THAT YOUR MOM?
SURE. YES, IT IS.
RIKKI, I LOOK AT IT KIND OF
AS AN AMBULANCE?CHASING
TYPE BUSINESS...
IT IS.
"I WISH RIKKI
WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY."
(sharks laugh)
