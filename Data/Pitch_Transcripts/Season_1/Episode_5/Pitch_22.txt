HI. MY NAME IS RIKKI FARRAR,
AND I'M THE OWNER
OF GOOD GRIEF CELEBRATIONS.
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK
THE SHARK TANK FOR $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
SO GOOD GRIEF CELEBRATIONS
IS A FUNERAL CONCIERGE SERVICE.
AS A FUNERAL CONCIERGE COMPANY,
WE'RE HAPPY TO WRITE THE EULOGY,
OFFICIATE THE FUNERAL SERVICE
AND HANDLE
ALL OF THE POST?FUNERAL
FAMILY GATHERING DETAILS.
THE CELEBRATION OF LIFE MOVEMENT
IS GAINING TREMENDOUS MOMENTUM.
WE OFFER CELEBRATION OF LIFE
PARTY PLANNING.
BERNIE MAC, MY MOTHER AS WELL.
RIKKI, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
YES, I'VE HAD, LAST YEAR,
$11,000 IN SALES.
THAT'S IT?
YES.
RIKKI, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?
I ACTUALLY CAME UP
WITH THIS IDEA
WHEN MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY
TWO YEARS AGO.
SHE HAD ME PLAN HER FUNERAL,
AND SHE KEPT ON SAYING
THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE
A CELEBRATION OF LIFE PARTY,
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT IT
TO BE SAD WITH A BUNCH OF TEARS.
SO I ACTUALLY PLANNED
AN AMAZING PARTY FOR HER.
WE HAD A DEEJAY.
WE HAD AN OPEN BAR
THAT SERVED
HER FAVORITE DRINKS.
(Harrington) RIKKI??
AND PEOPLE KEPT ON COMING UP TO
ME??I'M SORRY, IF I COULD JUST
ANSWER HIS QUESTION? THANK YOU.
PEOPLE KEPT ON COMING UP TO ME
TELLING ME THAT IT WAS SUCH
A GREAT IDEA AND THAT YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT TURNING IT
INTO A BUSINESS.
(Robert) RIKKI, YOU DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH YOUR MOM
PASSING AWAY AND PEOPLE
DRINKING AT A BAR?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
IT'S A CELEBRATION OF LIFE.
(O'Leary) ROBERT, WE IRISH
DO THAT EVERY DAY.
IRISH WAKE, YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
I LOVE THIS BUSINESS.
THANK YOU.
PEOPLE ARE DYING TO GET IN.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
LITERALLY.
THERE'S NEVER A BETTER TIME
TO UPSELL
THAN WHEN A FAMILY
IS STRICKEN WITH GRIEF,
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY
LOOKING AT THE MARGINS ANYMORE.
THAT FITS YOU SO WELL.
THAT SOUNDS
SO MUCH LIKE YOU.
BARBARA,
I'M DEALING WITH FACTS.
THIS IS WHY THE FUNERAL BUSINESS
IS WONDERFUL??
LOTS AND LOTS OF CLIENTS.
THE PROBLEM IS,
EVERYTHING YOU'VE LISTED,
WITH THE EXCEPTION, PERHAPS,
OF THE PARTY CELEBRATION
PLANNING,
IS INCORPORATED INTO MOST
FUNERAL HOME BUSINESS MODELS.
TELL ME WHY YOU THINK
YOU CAN COMPETE
WITH EVERY FUNERAL HOME WHEN YOU
DON'T HAVE ONE YOURSELF.
AND THAT'S WHY YOUR SALES
ARE SO LOW.
THE REASON WHY MY SALES ARE
SO LOW IS BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT CELEBRANTS EXIST.
OKAY, RIKKI, LET'S ROLE?PLAY.
SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY JUST DIED.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU EXIST.
RIGHT.
I'M SITTING DOWN
WITH THE DIRECTOR SAYING,
"I'M STRICKEN WITH GRIEF.
HELP ME GET THROUGH THIS."
AND HE'S UPSELLING ME
LIKE CRAZY. WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU'RE NOWHERE. YOU'RE NOT
EVEN INSIDE THAT ROOM,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
IN THE FUNERAL PARLOR.
THE BODIES ALWAYS GO THERE
FIRST. THEY DON'T COME TO YOU.
YOU HAVE NO DEAD GUY MAGNET.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I ACTUALLY USE
TO ATTRACT CLIENTS??
I HAVE A THERAPY DOG,
AND WE VISIT HOSPICE
AND NURSING HOMES.
AND AS PEOPLE DIE??
YOU WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO DIE?
THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS
THAT WE GET BUSINESS, YES.
(Robert) OH, COME ON.
DOES HE KIND OF SMELL
WHO'S ABOUT TO CROAK?
I WISH HE COULD. THAT WOULD
MAKE IT A LOT EASIER.
DO YOU NOT THINK YOU'RE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
YOU'RE GOING OUT
TO PEOPLE WITH A DOG
TO MAKE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE...
RIGHT.
SO YOU CAN SIGN
THEIR FAMILY UP FOR THIS DEAL?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH
IT. SHE'S NOT CHARGING FOR IT.
KEVIN, KEVIN. KEVIN,
JUST SHUT UP FOR A SEC.
NO. THERE'S NO MONEY IN IT.
NO, NO, NO.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW YOU DON'T
GIVE A CRAP, BUT??
I DO GIVE A CRAP. SHE'S MAKING
NO MARGIN ON THE DOG.
(Robert) THERE'S A MORE
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
WITH THIS PRESENTATION.
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN FRONT
OF PEOPLE IN THEIR MOMENT
OF NEED...
ABSOLUTELY.
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THEIR GRIEF.
NO, I'M TRYING TO GET BUSINESS.
(O'Leary) LIKE EVERY FUNERAL
HOME DOES, ROBERT, EVERY DAY.
EXACTLY.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE.
(Robert) I THINK SHE'S A SLICK
BUSINESSWOMAN, AND I THINK,
DEEP DOWN, SHE KNOWS SHE'S
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE.
AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DO, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN BUSINESS WITH YOU
FOR THAT REASON.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
LET ME ASK SOMETHING, RIKKI.
IS THAT YOUR MOM?
SURE. YES, IT IS.
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE
WOULD THINK OF THE BUSINESS?
IF MY MOTHER WAS ALIVE,
I HONESTLY WOULDN'T BE HERE
IN BUSINESS TODAY,
BECAUSE MY BUSINESS
IS A TRIBUTE TO HER.
I THINK HER LOOKING DOWN ON ME
RIGHT NOW,
SHE IS SO IMPRESSED AND AMAZED
AND VERY, VERY PROUD OF ME.
SO ROBERT IS ACTUALLY WRONG
IN THINKING THAT YOU'RE
JUST TRYING TO MANIPULATE
AND COME IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT FACT THAT
SOMEBODY'S GRIEVING?
IT'S NOT ABOUT MANIPULATING
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE AT ALL.
SOMEBODY HAS TO OFFICIATE
THE FUNERAL SERVICE.
SO WHY NOT US?
THE BOTTOM LINE
IS THE MONEY HERE.
AT $11,000 IN SALES...
I DON'T SEE MARGINS.
I DON'T SEE PROFIT IN THERE.
BUT I THINK THAT YOU DID
A COMMENDABLE JOB
OF PRESENTING IT TO US
AND GIVING US ALL THE FACTS,
BUT I'M OUT.
RIKKI, I LOOK AT IT KIND OF
AS AN AMBULANCE?CHASING
TYPE BUSINESS...
IT IS.
AND THAT'S REALLY NOT
THE BUSINESS I WANT TO BE IN...
OKAY.
SO I'M OUT ALSO.
I LOOKED FOR EVERY WAY POSSIBLE
TO FIND A REASON
TO INVEST IN YOU,
'CAUSE I LIKE DEATH.
IT'S INEVITABLE.
THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
AND THAT REASON ONLY,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
"I WISH RIKKI
WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY."
(sharks laugh)
