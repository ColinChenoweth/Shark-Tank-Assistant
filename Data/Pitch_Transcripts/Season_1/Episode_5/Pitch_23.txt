MY NAME'S JEFF COHEN,
I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 20 YEARS,
AND I HAVE 2 SONS.
(Jeff) WHO WANTS COLESLAW?
UH...
I'VE BEEN A DIABETIC
FOR 15 YEARS,
HI, MY NAME'S JEFF COHEN,
AND I'M THE GRANOLA GOURMET.
I'M LOOKING FOR
$175,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 25% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
BUT BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
I'D REALLY LIKE FOR YOU
TO TRY OUR PRODUCT.
KEVIN, IF YOU'D BE KIND ENOUGH
TO PASS THOSE DOWN.
SURE.
JEFF, WHAT EXPERIENCE DO YOU
HAVE IN MAKING GRANOLA BARS?
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE FORMULA?
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF? I SAY THAT
TO MY WIFE <i>ALL</i> THE TIME.
(laughs)
WELL, MY??MY SON WAS 15
AT THE TIME,
"JEFF, YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE,
UH, FRUIT FLAVORED BARS...
THEY'RE OKAY."
JEFF, HOW LONG YOU BEEN MARRIED?
UH, 20 YEARS TODAY.
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.
ISN'T IT FUNNY
THAT AFTER 20 YEARS,
"OKAY" FROM YOUR WIFE
IS, LIKE, "WHOO!"?
(both laugh)
IT USED TO BE,
"YOU'RE WONDERFUL."
NOW IT'S LIKE, "YOU'RE OKAY."
YOU GET THE GOD'S HONEST
FROM YOUR SPOUSE.
TOO HONEST SOMETIMES.
SOMETIMES.
OUR REAL SUCCESS HAS BEEN IN
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION
OF THE NATION'S
LARGEST NATURAL FOOD MARKET,
WHOLE FOODS.
FRANKLY, WE WORKED REAL HARD
TO GET IN.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
WITH WHOLE FOODS?
WELL, WITH WHOLE FOODS
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE DOING SOMEWHERE ABOUT
$8,000 OR $10,000 A MONTH.
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES?
THAT'S MOST OF OUR SALES.
ARE YOU SELLING
AT ONE WHOLE FOODS STORE?
WE'RE IN 90%
OF THE WHOLE FOODS STORES
IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
MARKET.
HOW MANY STORES IS THAT?
UH, RIGHT NOW, THAT'S 24.
ARE YOU GETTING REORDERS?
JEFF, LET'S BE REAL.
YOU WENT BANKRUPT.
THAT WIPED OUT YOUR ABILITY
TO RAISE MONEY FROM A BANK.
THAT'S LIFE.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
YOUR BUSINESS
IS NOT WORTH $700,000.
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH
JEFF, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY TAKE ON THIS RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING
AT YOUR GRANOLA BUSINESS.
IT'S A??TO ME, IT'S
A "ME, TOO" BUSINESS, OKAY?
WHAT IS ME, TOO?
I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE.
WHAT IS ME, TOO?
THERE'S 90 OTHER GUYS
DOING IT.
ME, TOO MEANS THERE'S??
ME, TOO. EVERYONE'S IN IT.
OH, ME, TOO! GOT IT.
OKAY, SO IT'S
A ME, TOO BUSINESS. I'M OUT.
JEFF, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR DECISION TO GO BANKRUPT.
IT CLEANS THE SLATE.
BUT IT CARRIES A WEIGHT.
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
A BANK, JEFF, EVER.
TO ME, YOU'RE RADIOACTIVE.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN? THERE'S
NOBODY WHO'S RADIOACTIVE.
AND JEFF KNOWS THIS??
THE MEASURE OF A MAN
IS NOT HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN.
CRY ME A RIVER, ROBERT.
THE MEASURE OF A MAN
IS HOW YOU GET UP FROM THAT.
THE GUY WENT BANKRUPT.
NOT MY FAULT.
YOU'VE NEVER FAILED?
I DIDN'T GO BANKRUPT,
BECAUSE I KNEW THE COST.
LET ME DEAL WITH JEFF FIRST,
AND THEN I'LL DEAL WITH YOU.
LET ME DEAL WITH JEFF FIRST,
AND THEN I'LL DEAL WITH YOU.
SURE. ALL RIGHT.
SO, JEFF, YOU'VE DONE
A VERY GOOD JOB
IN GETTING INTO
A VERY LARGE RETAILER,
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, JEFF.
OKAY.
SAME HERE.
