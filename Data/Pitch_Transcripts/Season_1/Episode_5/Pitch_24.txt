MY NAME'S JEFF COHEN,
AND I'M FROM
STEVENSON RANCH, CALIFORNIA.
I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 20 YEARS,
AND I HAVE 2 SONS.
(Jeff) WHO WANTS COLESLAW?
UH...
I'VE BEEN A DIABETIC
FOR 15 YEARS,
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND SNACKS THAT TASTE GOOD
THAT WON'T SPIKE
MY BLOOD SUGAR.
OKAY, SO GRAB THE OATS,
AND WE NEED 20 OUNCES OF OATS.
WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY,
WE'VE COME UP WITH A HEALTHY
GOURMET DIABETIC PRODUCT
THAT'S NOT JUST FOR DIABETICS
BUT ANYBODY INTERESTED
IN A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.
AND YUMMY.
I'VE INVESTED A LOT OF
OUR FAMILY'S HARD?EARNED MONEY
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
GO GET IT.
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR,
MY DREAM'S ALWAYS BEEN
TO DEVELOP A PRODUCT
THAT EVERYBODY LOVED
AND BRING IT TO THE MASS MARKET.
MY FAMILY'S ALL BEHIND IT.
I DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT ANYBODY.
IF I DON'T GET THE INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS,
THAT'S ALL AT RISK.
HI, MY NAME'S JEFF COHEN,
AND I'M THE GRANOLA GOURMET.
I'M LOOKING FOR
$175,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 25% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
BUT BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
I'D REALLY LIKE FOR YOU
TO TRY OUR PRODUCT.
KEVIN, IF YOU'D BE KIND ENOUGH
TO PASS THOSE DOWN.
SURE.
AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT
A GOURMET DIABETIC PRODUCT.
OUR PRODUCT HAS A SLOGAN.
THE SLOGAN IS...
"ENERGY BARS FOR ATHLETES,
DIABETICS &amp; YOU!"
I'VE BEEN DIABETIC
FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS
AND COULD NEVER REALLY FIND
A SNACK THAT BOTH
TASTED REALLY GOOD
AND WOULDN'T CAUSE
MY BLOOD SUGAR TO SPIKE.
OUT OF THAT,
WE CREATED GRANOLA GOURMET.
DID YOU GUYS LIKE THE BARS?
VERY NICE.
VERY GOOD.
THEY'RE ALSO REALLY GOOD
FOR YOU.
JEFF, WHAT EXPERIENCE DO YOU
HAVE IN MAKING GRANOLA BARS?
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE FORMULA?
I ACTUALLY WOKE UP, AND MY WIFE
WAS MAKING SOME GREAT MUFFINS.
AND I SAID, "HEY, BABE.
IT WOULD BE SO GREAT
IF WE COULD MAKE SOMETHING THAT
I COULD ACTUALLY EAT SOMETIME."
(sharks laugh)
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF? I SAY THAT
TO MY WIFE <i>ALL</i> THE TIME.
(laughs)
WELL, MY??MY SON WAS 15
AT THE TIME,
AND HE SAID,
"YOU KNOW, DAD, LET'S DO THAT.
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING
THAT <i>I</i> LIKE THAT <i>YOU</i> CAN EAT."
AND SO WE SPENT THAT ENTIRE
2?WEEK HOLIDAY PERIOD
LEARNING WHAT INGREDIENTS
ON THE GLYCEMIC INDEX WERE LOW.
IDENTIFYING THE FACT
THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WE COULD
MAKE A GRANOLA OUT OF THIS,
MY WIFE STARTED
EATING THESE WITH US,
AND SHE GAVE ME
THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT??
"JEFF, YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE,
UH, FRUIT FLAVORED BARS...
THEY'RE OKAY."
JEFF, HOW LONG YOU BEEN MARRIED?
UH, 20 YEARS TODAY.
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.
ISN'T IT FUNNY
THAT AFTER 20 YEARS,
"OKAY" FROM YOUR WIFE
IS, LIKE, "WHOO!"?
(both laugh)
IT USED TO BE,
"YOU'RE WONDERFUL."
NOW IT'S LIKE, "YOU'RE OKAY."
YOU GET THE GOD'S HONEST
FROM YOUR SPOUSE.
TOO HONEST SOMETIMES.
SOMETIMES.
OUR REAL SUCCESS HAS BEEN IN
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION
OF THE NATION'S
LARGEST NATURAL FOOD MARKET,
WHOLE FOODS.
FRANKLY, WE WORKED REAL HARD
TO GET IN.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
WITH WHOLE FOODS?
WELL, WITH WHOLE FOODS
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE DOING SOMEWHERE ABOUT
$8,000 OR $10,000 A MONTH.
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES?
THAT'S MOST OF OUR SALES.
ARE YOU SELLING
AT ONE WHOLE FOODS STORE?
WE'RE IN 90%
OF THE WHOLE FOODS STORES
IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
MARKET.
HOW MANY STORES IS THAT?
UH, RIGHT NOW, THAT'S 24.
ARE YOU GETTING REORDERS?
EVERY WEEK OR TWO WEEKS,
WE'RE IN REFILLING OUR RACK.
FOR A BUSINESS
THAT'S BEEN UP AND RUNNING
LESS THAN A YEAR?
GOOD FOR YOU.
WE'VE ACTUALLY
ONLY BEEN DOING IT
FOR ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS.
BUT WHY AREN'T YOU
AT OTHER STORES?
LET'S FORGET THE OTHER STORES
FOR A SECOND,
BECAUSE I LIKE YOUR APPROACH.
YOU GOT INTO WHOLE FOODS.
STEP ONE. THEY GOT BEHIND YOU.
STEP TWO.
TO ME, STEP THREE IS ROLL IT OUT
NATIONALLY TO WHOLE FOODS.
THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR SALES.
AND THEN GO TO OTHER RETAILERS
ONCE IT'S ON A NATIONAL BASIS.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT?
IT REQUIRES CASH.
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE BEEN
BOOTSTRAPPING THE COMPANY
FROM THE BEGINNING.
AND WHY HAVE YOU COME TO US
INSTEAD OF GOING TO A BANK?
I HAD A SOFTWARE COMPANY.
I HAD PERSONALLY GUARANTEED
A LOT OF LOANS
FOR THAT BUSINESS.
AFTER SIX YEARS
OF HAVING RUN IT SUCCESSFULLY,
I GOT STUCK
WITH A NUMBER OF THOSE LOANS
AFTER SELLING SOME OF THE ASSETS
OF THE FIRM AND CLOSING IT.
THAT BUSINESS WENT BANKRUPT
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
UH, I HAD A PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY
BECAUSE OF IT.
YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU $175,000,
AND I'LL GET 25%
OF YOUR COMPANY,
SO I'D CALCULATE YOUR WHOLE
COMPANY AS WORTH $700,000 NOW
WITH $80,000 A YEAR
WORTH OF SALES.
I DON'T SEE HOW
IT'S WORTH $700,000.
I AGREE
IT'S NOT WORTH $700,000.
HE'S DOING 80 TO 90 GRAND
A YEAR IN SALES.
JEFF, LET'S BE REAL.
YOU WENT BANKRUPT.
THAT WIPED OUT YOUR ABILITY
TO RAISE MONEY FROM A BANK.
THAT'S LIFE.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
YOUR BUSINESS
IS NOT WORTH $700,000.
IT'S PROBABLY WORTH
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS RIGHT NOW??
TWO TIMES SALES??
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
FOR ME TO GIVE YOU $175,000,
I'D HAVE TO OWN
YOUR WHOLE COMPANY.
I PUT A NUMBER OUT THERE
THAT I DIDN'T THINK
WAS GONNA BE
AN OUTRAGEOUS NUMBER
BUT WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD WORK FROM TOGETHER.
JEFF, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY TAKE ON THIS RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING
AT YOUR GRANOLA BUSINESS.
IT'S A??TO ME, IT'S
A "ME, TOO" BUSINESS, OKAY?
WHAT IS ME, TOO?
I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE.
WHAT IS ME, TOO?
THERE'S 90 OTHER GUYS
DOING IT.
ME, TOO MEANS THERE'S??
ME, TOO. EVERYONE'S IN IT.
OH, ME, TOO! GOT IT.
OKAY, SO IT'S
A ME, TOO BUSINESS. I'M OUT.
I LIKE YOU. I REALLY DO,
AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE
THE TASTE OF THEM.
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I'M OUT.
OKAY.
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LOT MORE MONEY,
AND I'M NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER SEE
A RETURN ON MY INVESTMENT.
SO I WISH YOU LUCK,
BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE
A GREAT PRODUCT HERE.
BUT I'M NOT IN IT.
I'M OUT.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
JEFF, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR DECISION TO GO BANKRUPT.
IT CLEANS THE SLATE.
BUT IT CARRIES A WEIGHT.
IF I WAS YOUR PARTNER,
AND THE BUSINESS WAS SUCCESSFUL,
WE WOULD REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL,
AND NO BANK IS GOING
TO LOAN YOU ANY MONEY.
THAT CAUSES ME TO PUT UP
MORE CAPITAL AND MORE CAPITAL
AND MORE CAPITAL.
IT'S A FACT. YOU NEED A BANK
AT SOME POINT.
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
A BANK, JEFF, EVER.
TO ME, YOU'RE RADIOACTIVE.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN? THERE'S
NOBODY WHO'S RADIOACTIVE.
AND JEFF KNOWS THIS??
THE MEASURE OF A MAN
IS NOT HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN.
CRY ME A RIVER, ROBERT.
THE MEASURE OF A MAN
IS HOW YOU GET UP FROM THAT.
THE GUY WENT BANKRUPT.
NOT MY FAULT.
YOU'VE NEVER FAILED?
I DIDN'T GO BANKRUPT,
BECAUSE I KNEW THE COST.
LET ME DEAL WITH JEFF FIRST,
AND THEN I'LL DEAL WITH YOU.
LET ME DEAL WITH JEFF FIRST,
AND THEN I'LL DEAL WITH YOU.
SURE. ALL RIGHT.
SO, JEFF, YOU'VE DONE
A VERY GOOD JOB
IN GETTING INTO
A VERY LARGE RETAILER,
AND YOU DON'T SEEM FOCUSED
ON MAXIMIZING
ON THAT OPPORTUNITY.
ONLY FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, JEFF.
OKAY.
SAME HERE.
