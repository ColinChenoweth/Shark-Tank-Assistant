ISN'T THE REAL CHALLENGE
THAT YOU'RE NOT A SODA GUY
AND YOU'RE NOT
AN ICE CREAM GUY?
COULD SELL IT
IN THE FREEZER SECTION,
LIKE, AT A CONVENIENCE STORE.
WITH THE ICE CREAM
ALREADY PACKAGED?
WITH THE IC??EXACTLY.
BUT THEN WE'RE BACK
TO THE SAME STARTING POINT.
YOU'RE NOT THE ICE CREAM GUY.
THIS IS A SALE THAT YOU HAVE TO
MAKE TO A BIG CORPORATION.
THAT ISN'T MY BUSINESS,
SO I GOTTA SAY, I'M OUT.
I'M AN OLD?SCHOOL
KIND OF GUY.
I LIKE TO GO AND SCOOP IT
AND ALSO BE ABLE TO DIG INTO
THE ICE CREAM SIMULTANEOUSLY.
SURE.
SO I'M OUT.
SO I THINK YOU LOOK THE PART.
YOU LOOK LIKE A GUY THAT SHOULD
BE SELLING ROOT BEER FLOATS.
YEAH, YOU REALLY DO.
BUT HERE'S THE THING??
I THINK IT'S AN ICE CREAM CUP
YOU OUGHT TO SELL
TO AN ICE CREAM GUY.
THAT WHAT I THINK. BUT I'M
NOT BUYING IN. SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THERE'S ONLY
ONE STRATEGY HERE.
THE ICE CREAM COMPANIES
LICENSE IT FROM YOU
AND PREPACKAGE IT,
AS YOU YOURSELF SAID...
MM?HMM.
OR THEY DON'T.
AND IF THEY DON'T, YOU'RE GONNA
BE FIZZING AROUND FOREVER
AS A LITTLE NOVELTY
AND NEVER MAKE ANY MONEY.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I'M HEATH HALL. I WORK FOR
A THINK TANK ON CAPITOL HILL.
I'M BRETT THOMPSON.
I'M A LOBBYIST ON K STREET.
WE'VE DECIDE TO TAKE
USELESS PORK BARREL SPENDING
AND PUT OUR MONEY TO GOOD USE
TO CREATE OUR NEW COMPANY,
PORK BARREL BBQ.
PORK BARREL BBQ IS
AN ALL AMERICAN BARBECUE SAUCE
AND SPICE RUB COMPANY,
AND WE'RE HOPING TO BRING
OUR MONUMENTAL FLAVOR
TO THE ENTIRE NATION. HEATH
AND I ARE BOTH CONSERVATIVES,
AND, YOU KNOW, WE'VE WATCHED
AS WASHINGTON SEEMS
TO BE BAILING EVERYTHING OUT.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE WANTED TO
PROVE, IF YOU HAD A GOOD IDEA,
YOU COULD STILL
USE THE AMERICAN DREAM
TO BUILD SOMETHING GREAT.
OUR ALL AMERICAN?SPICE RUB
IS GREAT ON MEAT
AND EVEN VEGETABLES,
WHICH WE THINK OUR LIBERAL
FRIENDS WILL APPRECIATE.
WE'RE GONNA BE SMOKIN' UP
SOME RIBS AND PULLED PORK.
WE'RE HOPING THE SHARKS
REALLY LOVE
OUR BARBECUE AND OUR SAUCE
AND OUR RUB.
AND WE THINK THEY'LL SALIVATE
OVER THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
THEY COULD MAKE
WITH OUR COMPANY.
I'M BRETT THOMPSON...
C. E. O. OF PORK BARREL BBQ.
AND I'M HEATH HALL,
PRESIDENT OF PORK BARREL BBQ,
A WASHINGTON, D. C.,
GOURMET DRY RUB
AND BARBECUE SAUCE COMPANY.
WE'RE SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 10% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY,
WE THINK,
TO BE PARTNERS
WITH AN AMERICAN COMPANY
THAT ISN'T OWNED OR OPERATED
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
(sharks laugh)
HEATH AND I LOVE TWO THINGS??
MAKING GREAT BARBECUE
AND MAKING LOTS OF MONEY.
IN SIX SHORT MONTHS,
WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED,
BRANDED AND MARKETED
OUR ALL AMERICAN SPICE RUB
AND OUR PORK BARREL BBQ SAUCE,
WHICH WAS RECENTLY VOTED
ONE OF THE BEST
BARBECUE SAUCES IN THE NATION.
OUR INAUGURAL PRODUCT,
PORK BARREL BBQ'S
ALL AMERICAN SPICE RUB,
IS A BIPARTISAN BLEND OF
ALL?NATURAL HERBS AND SPICES.
YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT
ON PORK, CHICKEN, BEEF.
HECK, BRETT AND I EVEN THINK
IT'S GREAT ON SHARK.
YOU KNOW, OUR FRIENDS
THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY
TO START A COMPANY AT THE PEAK
OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS.
WE SAW IT AS OUR CHANCE TO GRAB
A PIECE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
YOU KNOW, BRETT AND I
ARE BOTH FROM MISSOURI,
THE SHOW?ME STATE,
SO WE WANTED
TO LET OUR PRODUCTS SHOW YOU
JUST HOW GREAT THEY TASTE.
WE'VE BEEN TOLD
BY COMPETITIVE BARBECUE TEAMS,
VETERAN CHEFS AND, MOST
IMPORTANT TO US, HOME COOKS
THAT OUR RUB AND SAUCE
IS THE BEST THEY'VE EVER HAD,
AND WE THINK YOU'LL AGREE.
WHOSE RECIPE IS THIS?
UH, THIS IS OUR RECIPE. I?I LIKE
TO EAT, SO I LIKE TO COOK.
AND SO IT'S
A REAL PASSION OF MINE.
AND SO I'M ALWAYS
EXPERIMENTING IN THE KITCHEN.
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE, UH,
MARINADES AND??AND RUBS
AND SAUCES THAT I'VE COME UP
WITH OVER THE YEARS.
YOU GUYS ARE STARTING OUT
WITH A PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT.
IT TASTE GREAT.
(Heath) THANK YOU.
BUT IT'S COMPLETELY UNKNOWN
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE.
WELL, IF YOU NOTICE ON THE,
UH, FAR SIDE OF THE TABLE,
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE TROPHIES
THERE. JUST ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
WE WERE AT THE NATIONAL BARBECUE
BATTLE IN WASHINGTON, D. C.
OVER 50 TEAMS WERE THERE
AT THE COMPETITION.
WE TOOK SECOND PLACE
IN THE NATION
IN THE BEST SAUCE
IN THE NATION CONTEST.
NOT BAD.
AND, UH, YOU'RE VALUING
YOUR COMPANY AT THIS POINT
AT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
THEY'RE JUST JOKING ABOUT THAT.
I KNOW THEY'RE NOT SERIOUS.
ONE OTHER THING
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT
IS THAT IT'S ALL?NATURAL
WITH NO PRESERVATIVES.
I LOVE THE WAY HE DID THAT.
HE DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,
JUST LIKE A POLITICIAN.
OH, NO. NO, HE WENT RIGHT ON.
HE WENT TO THE NEXT ONE.
WHAT??WHY DON'T??
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER HIS
QUESTION ABOUT YOUR VALUATION?
WE JUST SCORED A HUGE DEAL
TO HAVE OUR PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTED
IN MAJOR GROCERY STORE CHAINS,
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE 10,000
UNITS IN PRODUCTION RIGHT NOW
HEADING OUT TO STORES
NEXT MONTH.
FOR THAT 10,000 UNITS,
WHAT'S THE DOLLAR SIZE?
IT COSTS US $2
TO PRODUCE THE RUB,
$1.80 TO PRODUCE THE SAUCE.
AND, UH, WE HAVE
A 50% PROFIT BUILT IN.
OVER A FULL YEAR,
WE ANTICIPATE,
BASED UPON
VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES,
$4.1 MILLION WORTH OF REVENUE
AND OVER $1 MILLION WORTH
OF PROFIT.
YOUR BARBECUE SAUCE
TASTES GREAT.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
A LITTLE SECRET.
I WAS AN INVESTOR
IN A BARBECUE SAUCE COMPANY
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT TASTED GREAT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY MONEY? IT'S GONE.
I DON'T MEAN TO DOUBT YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE POLITICIANS...
HA!
BUT I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR.
HEATH, YOU'VE GOT $30,000 TODAY,
HARD COPY ORDERS.
RIGHT.
YOU SAID THAT YOU BELIEVE
CONSERVATIVELY...
CORRECT.
THAT WILL COME OUT
TO $4 MILLION.
THAT'S RIGHT,
OVER THE FIRST YEAR.
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
FROM STOCKING
$30,000 WORTH OF ORDERS
TO GET TO $4 MILLION.
WE CHOSE THE BEST DISTRIBUTOR
ON THE EAST COAST,
FROM NEW YORK TO FLORIDA.
HE HAS 22 YEARS EXPERIENCE.
HE'S USED HIS REVENUE
PROJECTIONS AND HIS EXPERIENCE
TO COME UP WITH REAL
AND CONSERVATIVE?BASED NUMBERS.
THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS
IS PURELY ONE OF DISTRIBUTION.
AND IT'S
ALL ABOUT MARKETING.
AND AT YOUR SIZE,
YOU'RE??YOU'RE THIS.
I'M OUT.
I THINK ROBERT
HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.
THE KEY TO THIS
IS DISTRIBUTION.
YOU'RE PROJECTING
$4 MILLION IN SALES,
BUT WHAT IF THE 10,000 UNITS
DOESN'T SELL?
IF IT FLIES, YOU MAY
GO TO THE MOON. OKAY?
IF IT DOESN'T,
YOU MAY BE OUT OF BUSINESS.
I JUST SEE IT, UH,
SINKING OR SWIMMING HERE
ON THIS DISTRIBUTOR.
THE RISK DOESN'T WORK
FOR ME REALLY, SO I'M OUT.
PROBABLY
EVERY ONE OF US UP HERE
CAN THINK WE CAN MAKE
A BARBECUE SAUCE
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR NOT.
AND YOU KNOW THIS IS
A CROWDED SPACE. I'M OUT.
TWO PROBLEMS WITH IT??
VALUATION,
WHICH HAS BEEN POINTED OUT,
UH, AD NAUSEAM HERE,
BECAUSE IT'S??IT'S HUGE
FOR A START?UP.
BUT YOU'RE NOT FULL?TIME.
YOU GUYS ARE POLITICIANS/
HOBBYISTS WITH SAUCE.
THAT'S BASICALLY IT.
AND IF??IF I MAY, YOU KNOW,
IT'S THE GOAL OF EVERY AMERICAN
TO BE ABLE TO OWN
AND RUN THEIR OWN COMPANY.
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING MONEY
FOR US AND FOR OUR FAMILY.
NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT, I MEAN,
WITHOUT HAVING THE FOCUS
OF A FULL?TIME TEAM OR GUY,
AT LEAST ONE OF YOU
GETTING UP IN THE MORNING,
NOSE TO GRINDSTONE,
MAKING RUBS AND SAUCES,
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
UNTIL YOU PROVE THIS THING
BEYOND THE EMBRYONIC STATE
IT'S IN RIGHT NOW.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I'M SITTING HERE,
LOOKING AT BRETT AND HEATH.
HEATH, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU WITHOUT
PICTURING YOU IN A PIG COSTUME.
THE MASCOT?
AND YOU'RE??THE MASCOT.
(Robert laughs)
YOU'RE A VERY HANDSOME MAN.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU LOOK
LIKE A PIG. I'M JUST SAYING??
OH, I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE SAYING!
NO, I'M SAYING YOU WOULD LOOK
ADORABLE AS A REAL?LIFE MASCOT.
(Daymond) YEAH.
I GUESS I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
YOU CAN TAKE IT.
ONLY A POLITICIAN WOULD
TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT!
YOU KNOW, UM, ACTUALLY
I'M INTERESTED IN YOUR BUSINESS.
BUT, OF COURSE,
THE NUMBERS ARE CRAZY.
WHAT ABOUT THE $50,000?
I DON'T SEE THAT AS A LOT OF
MONEY TO PRODUCE MUCH PRODUCT.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THE $50,000 RUNS OUT?
I THINK THE??THE REVENUE
THAT WE'LL GENERATE,
PLUS WE ACTUALLY HAVE ANOTHER
$100,000 OF OUR OWN MONEY
THAT WE'RE PREPARED TO INVEST.
OH, REALLY?
WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO THIS.
THIS IS NOT A HOBBY.
BARBARA, ARE YOU MAKING
AN OFFER?
I AM.
THE OFFER IS
I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU
THE $50,000, ALL RIGHT?
BUT FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO
40% AND A PIG COSTUME?
(laughs)
NO.
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY
I WASN'T ASKING FOR 51%.
WE'D LOVE TO ACCEPT
YOUR OFFER.
ARE YOU WITH HIM ON THAT?
I'M WITH HIM ON THAT.
YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.
GREAT.
YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(kisses cheek)
(laughs) THANK YOU. THANK YOU
SO MUCH. (kisses cheek)
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS.
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS,
HE DOESN'T EVEN NEED A COSTUME.
HE JUST NEEDS THE EARS.
I DIDN'T CALL??NO, NOT AT ALL.
YOU JUST CALLED HIM A PIG
ON NATIONAL TV.
(O'Leary) I THINK YOU DID.
I THINK YOU DID, YEAH.
I DID NOT.
WE WENT INTO THE TANK
FACING FIVE SHARKS.
IN THE END, THERE WAS
ONE SHARK STANDING...
AND ONE PIG.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE SO EXCITED WE GOT A DEAL.
I'M THE WORLD'S
MOST ACCURATE KNIFE THROWER.
WOW.
MOMMY!
YOU ARE NUTS, DAYMOND.
EDWIN, ARE YOU A VAMPIRE?
ENOUGH CHATTER.
LET'S DO IT.
LET ME SWEETEN MY OFFER.
WE ALL KNOW KEVIN'S DEAL
IS A WASTE OF TIME.
NO, IT ISN'T.
YOU'RE OUT.
NO, NO, I'M NOT FINISHED.
I WOULDN'T TAKE HIS OFFER.
NOISE! NOISE!
YOU'RE LIKE
HIGH SCHOOL BOYS??
BARBARA, I'M OFFENDED
BY YOUR SEXISM.
