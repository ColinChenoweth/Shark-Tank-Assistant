MY NAME IS JONATHAN, I'M 29,
AND I LIVE IN CHICAGO
WITH MY WIFE JENNY.
MY COMPANY IS ELEMENT BARS.
WE DO CUSTOM ENERGY BARS.
SO THE INSPIRATION
FOR ELEMENT BARS WAS THAT
I USED TO EAT AN OFF?THE?SHELF
ENERGY BAR AND THEN CRASH.
SO I'D LOOK AT THE LABEL,
AND THE LABEL HAD A LIST
OF COMPLETELY UNPRONOUNCEABLE
INGREDIENTS, AND I WAS LIKE,
THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY.
I WANTED A BAR THAT WAS
WHOLESOME AND NATURAL
AND CATERED
TO MY SPECIFIC TASTES.
SO I STARTED MAKING MY OWN
ENERGY BARS IN MY OWN KITCHEN.
AND THAT WAS PROBABLY
ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO.
AT THE CURRENT FACILITY,
WE CAN MAKE FROM 12 BARS
TO THOUSANDS OF BARS A DAY.
IN FACT, WE'RE SHIPPING
ABOUT A THOUSAND BARS PER WEEK,
SO WE REALLY HAVE GROWN
IN OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY
BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO GROW
TO THE NEXT STEP.
SO TODAY'S ORDER
IS CRISPY CRANBERRY.
SO IT'S OUR CRISPY BASE
WITH CRANBERRIES,
A LITTLE BIT OF PEANUT BUTTER
IN THERE
AND SOME CRUNCH FROM, UH,
SOME SOY NUTS IN THERE.
GETS ALL MIXED TOGETHER
AND, UH, THEN THEY'RE GONNA
MEASURE IT OUT AND MOLD IT
INTO EACH INDIVIDUAL BAR.
I'VE PUT A LOT INTO THIS.
I'VE PUT A YEAR AND A HALF
OF MY OWN TIME
AND REALLY BEEN LEANING ON
MY WIFE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT US
IN THIS VERY TOUGH
ECONOMIC TIME.
SO THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON IT.
HI. MY NAME IS JONATHAN MILLER.
MY COMPANY IS ELEMENT BARS.
I'M SEEKING
A $150,000 EQUITY INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF THE COMPANY.
AT ELEMENT BARS,
USERS VISIT OUR WEB SITE
TO CREATE THEIR OWN
CUSTOM ENERGY BAR
BY FIRST SELECTING WHOLE,
NATURAL INGREDIENTS,
PERSONALIZING A LABEL, AND THEN
A FRESH BATCH OF ENERGY BARS
SHOWS UP AT YOUR DOORSTEP
IN SEVEN TO TEN DAYS.
NOW I DID MY HOMEWORK
AND I CREATED EACH OF YOU
YOUR OWN CUSTOM ENERGY BAR.
(Robert) THANK YOU, JONATHAN.
(chuckles)
(Barbara and Daymond)
THANK YOU.
(Harrington) I APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.
SO THE FIRST THING
YOU MIGHT'VE ALREADY NOTICED
IS THAT THE LABEL
HAS BEEN PERSONALIZED FOR YOU.
SO, KEVIN'S, FOR EXAMPLE,
IS CALLED THE "AS SEEN ON TV,"
AND BARBARA'S IS CALLED
THE "SWEET AND SMART BAR."
Y?YOU'RE ALSO TASTING
THE CUSTOMIZED BAR
FOR YOUR TASTE
AND NUTRITIONAL NEEDS.
SO AS I SAID, WE PERSONALIZE
THE LABEL BUT WE ALSO CUSTOMIZE
THE INGREDIENTS
INSIDE THE BAR FOR YOU.
IT'S VERY GOOD.
SO LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW I MADE BARBARA'S BAR
AND HOW ANYONE
CAN USE OUR WEB SITE
TO CREATE THEIR OWN CUSTOM
ENERGY BAR. SO YOU USE
OUR BUILD A BAR INTERFACE,
AND YOU FIRST SELECT A CORE.
DO YOU WANT IT CHEWY?
DO YOU WANT IT OATY?
DO YOU WANT IT CRISPY
OR DO YOU WANT IT DATEY?
SO FOR BARBARA'S BAR,
WHICH WE'RE SHOWING HERE,
YOU SELECT THE CHEWY CORE.
NOW WE WALK YOU THROUGH THE REST
OF THE 5?STEP PROCESS
TO SELECT YOUR FRUITS, NUTS,
SWEETS AND BOOSTS ALONG THE WAY.
AS YOU ADD
EACH SPECIFIC INGREDIENT,
THE NUTRITION LABEL ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF THE SCREEN HERE
CONTINUOUSLY GETS UPDATED.
I'M GONNA NOT EAT ANY MORE
TILL I KNOW HOW MANY CALORIES
ARE IN HERE.
(Robert)
IT'S RIGHT ON THE BACK.
IT'S RIGHT ON THE BACK.
YEAH, YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT.
SO I'VE JUST TRIED
THE "MR. WONDERFUL BAR."
YEAH.
AND, YES, I AM MR. WONDERFUL,
BUT THE BAR WAS QUITE GOOD.
WHY IS THIS COMPANY
VALUED AT $1 MILLION?
BECAUSE THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S WORTH
WHEN YOU ASK ME
FOR $150,000 FOR 15%.
SURE. SO WE STARTED
IN AUGUST 2008.
WE'VE SOLD ABOUT 30,000 BARS
TO DATE, JUST 20,000 THIS YEAR.
WE'RE ON TRACK TO HIT 44,000
BARS BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
WE'VE DOUBLED OUR SALES IN??
JUST IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.
WE'VE GROWN 15% PER YEAR.
SO YOU GROSSED HOW MUCH
LAST YEAR?
SO THAT??WELL, IT WAS ONLY
A PARTIAL YEAR??AUGUST 2008??
SO WE ONLY GROSSED $12,000.
SO THIS YEAR
WE'RE ABOUT $50,000 TO DATE.
IT'S AN INTERESTING BUSINESS.
MM?HMM.
BUT THE VALUE
THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOUR BUSINESS IS WORTH
IS INSANE.
YOU'VE GOT $50,000 IN SALES, SO
I BELIEVE THE MACHINE'S WORKING.
YOU'VE SENT SOME BARS OUT.
GOT IT.
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE.
YOU DON'T HAVE
A MILLION?DOLLAR BUSINESS,
AND YET, YOU WANT ME TO
GIVE YOU MY MONEY AS IF YOU DID.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR PERSPECTIVE.
I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED IN V. C.
MY GOAL IS??
IF YOU SAY YOU WORKED
IN VENTURE CAPITAL,
THEN YOU KNOW MY JOB
IS TO SQUEEZE YOUR HEAD LIKE
A TEENAGE PIMPLE RIGHT NOW.
(chuckles)
AND I ABSOLUTELY
UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND.
AND YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND
THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE TABLE??
THAT YOU'RE BUYING INTO
NOT ONLY THE BUSINESS
BUT YOU'RE BUYING INTO ME.
SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YOU'RE A V. C. GUY.
YOU'RE A SMART GUY.
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT,
THE IDEA OR EXECUTION?
I BELIEVE IT'S EXECUTION.
I DO, TOO. SO HOW DO YOU GO
IN A YEAR AND A HALF
WITH AN INTERESTING IDEA
TO $1 MILLION?
DO YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH THAT TODAY?
I BELIEVE IT'S WORTH IT TODAY.
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
IT'S WORTH $1 MILLION TODAY.
YOU CAN'T.
YOU'RE TOO SMART A GUY.
YOU??YOU SAT AROUND
IN YOUR KITCHEN OR WHEREVER,
CAME UP WITH AN IDEA,
AND A YEAR AND A HALF LATER,
YOU WANNA SAY
IT'S WORTH $1 MILLION.
I?I GENUINELY BELIEVE??
I MEAN, I ATE THE ENERGY BAR
FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT, ONCE IT
ENTERS YOUR LIFESTYLE??
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
HAVE YOU PUT INTO THIS BUSINESS?
I PUT $50,000 OF MY OWN MONEY,
AND I HAVEN'T TAKEN A SALARY
OUT OF THIS COMPANY
IN A YEAR AND A HALF.
OH, CRY ME A RIVER.
I BELIEVE IN IT SO STRONG,
THAT'S WHAT I'M WILLING
TO COMMIT TO.
YOU GOTTA DO THAT.
YOU'RE A START?UP GUY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU GOTTA WORK LIKE A DOG.
AB?ABSOLUTELY.
BUT I'M SELLING YOU
MY PASSION.
I'M SELLING YOU
BOTH THE HORSE AND THE JOCKEY.
OKAY, LET'S SAY
YOU'RE WONDERFUL,
YOU DID A GREAT PRESENTATION.
YOU HAVE $50,000 IN SALES.
IF I SAID YOUR COMPANY
WAS WORTH TEN TIMES THAT,
IT WOULD STILL ONLY BE WORTH
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
AND YOU WANT...
NOT 10% MORE THAN THAT.
YOU WANT 100% MORE THAN THAT.
MM?HMM.
ARE YOU BEING A SAVAGE,
GREEDY PIG OR NOT?
I'M DOING WHAT'S IN
THE BEST INTEREST
OF THE COMPANY
AND THE IDEA.
WELL, MAYBE NOT BECAUSE??
YEAH, YOU MAY LOSE THE DEAL.
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THE PROCESS
OR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
WHAT'S UNIQUE??
I?I DISAGREE WITH YOU.
WHAT'S UNIQUE... (stammers)
NO, WAIT A SECOND.
HERE'S MY QUESTION.
WHAT DO WE NEED THIS GUY FOR?
(Daymond) YEAH.
(Barbara) YOU NEED HIS FORMULA.
WHY DO WE NEED HIS FORMULA?
WE COULD FIND THAT.
YOU CAN JUST GO TO A FACTORY
AND GET THIS DONE YOURSELF.
YOU??UNFORTUNATELY, YOU CAN'T.
(Daymond and O'Leary) WHY?
ESPECIALLY NOT??
NOT AT SMALL VOLUMES.
THAT'S OUR
OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN ME
AND THE BUSINESS.
GIVE ME THE MONEY,
KNOW THAT I CAN DO IT,
AND I WILL EXECUTE
AND SHOW YOU THE NUMBERS.
YOU CAME IN HERE,
I ATE YOUR BAR.
I GOT A SUGAR HIGH.
I GOT EXCITED. NOW I'M CRASHING.
(laughs)
WITH DATES? THERE'S NO ADDED
SUGAR IN YOUR DATE BAR.
NO, NO. I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU KNOW,
I'LL BE THE FIRST
TO SAY THIS.
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST DEAL
I'VE LOOKED AT??
'CAUSE YOU LOVE THE GUY.
I LOVE THE GUY.
I'VE GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING.
I REALLY AM.
AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ME
VERY OFTEN, MY FRIEND.
BUT I'M... OUT.
I?I??BE??I WOULD LIKE
TO ANSWER YOUR OBJECTIONS,
EVEN IF YOU ARE OUT, OKAY?
WHAT YOU SEE
ON THE WEB SITE
IS ONLY THE TIP
OF THE ICEBERG, OKAY?
SO WHAT WE HAVE IS THE ACTUAL
RECIPES BEHIND THE BARS.
WHAT YOU TASTED
TASTED GREAT.
MOST OF THE ENERGY BARS
OUT THERE TASTE LIKE CHALK.
THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS.
SECOND THING IS THE ACTUAL
TRADE SECRETS THAT ARE??
GO BEHIND??
HE'S SUCH A GREAT SALESMAN!
HE IS GREAT BUT HE'S NOT WORTH??
HE'S NOT WORTH $1 MILLION!
THAT'S THE THING.
I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR.
(O'Leary) UGH!
BUT I SELL MY BUSINESS.
I BELIEVE IN IT PASSIONATELY.
YOU'RE LIKE A MICRO??
A MINI SHARK.
OKAY.
BUT I DON'T GET THE BUSINESS
PERSONALLY.
OKAY.
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
THE MARKET IS THERE.
OR IF IT IS THERE, I THINK
SOMEBODY'S GONNA KNOCK IT OFF.
SO I'D BE NERVOUS AT NIGHT,
YOU HOLDING MY MONEY. I'M OUT.
I MEAN, THERE IS A SAYING IN
BUSINESS THAT THE FIRST PERSON
TO SAY THE NUMBER LOSES.
AND YOU REALLY DID PUT UP
A VERY HIGH NUMBER.
IF A GREATER EQUITY
WAS OUT THERE,
WOULD THAT STILL INTEREST YOU
OR??OR PERIOD?
YOU'RE OFFERING MORE EQUITY?
WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY
A POSSIBILITY.
WHY DON'T YOU
PUT OUT A NUMBER?
PUT OUT A NUMBER, YEAH.
NAH, I?I CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH
MYSELF. YOU PULL THE LEVER.
I'M GIVING YOU THE POWER.
THE VALUATION IS STILL CRAZY,
AS HE SAID.
I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE 75%.
IS THAT AN OFFER?
OH, MY GOD. THIS GUY'S GREAT.
I LOVE THIS GUY!
HE IS. HE IS, RIGHT?
YEAH.
YOU SHOULD FORGET THIS BUSINESS.
COME WORK FOR ME.
FOR 75% OF THE BUSINESS,
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000.
I?I MEAN,
I?I'M OPEN TO HEARING
WHAT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS ARE
OUT THERE.
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
MY OFFER?
I WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR YOUR OFFER.
ALL RIGHT. SEVEN YEARS AGAIN,
I BOUGHT INTO
THE CUSTOMIZED NUTRITION
CONCEPT.
OKAY.
AND IT TURNED OUT, UH,
THIS COMPANY IS NOW TAKING OFF.
I BELIEVE THEY'RE GONNA
BE INTERESTED IN THIS PRODUCT.
AND CONTINGENT UPON
THAT EXECUTION OF THAT DEAL,
I'D PUT UP THE $150,000
FOR 100% OF THE COMPANY,
AND YOU'LL GET
A 4% ROYALTY FOREVER??
AS WE SAY, IN PERPETUITY.
SO THERE'S TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
BUT REMEMBER, I'M A MARKETING
AND BRANDING GENIUS,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
THE BEST THING YOU'VE SOLD HERE
WAS JONATHAN. YOU'RE A STAR.
LET'S NOT WASTE
EACH OTHER'S TIME.
LET ME JUST ASK
A REALLY SIMPLE QUESTION.
ARE YOU GONNA GO ABOVE 50%
OR NOT? YEAH.
AM I GONNA GO ABOVE 50%? NO.
I'M OUT.
YOU'RE A GREAT SALESMAN
BUT YOU'RE NOT A GREAT
BUSINESS GUY. I'M OUT.
I'M DECLINING??I'M DECLINING
THE??THE COUNTER OF 20%
AND THE??THE??THE??THE INSULT.
BUT HE'S A BEAST.
OKAY. YEAH, HE'S A BEAST.
I LIKE HIM.
I LIKE HIM A LOT.
I THINK HE'S AN ENTREPRENEUR.
WITH THAT SAID, I'M OUT.
RIGHT.
WHERE DO WE STAND?
SO YOU'RE GONNA PAY
$150,000...
AND THEN YOU ARE GONNA RECEIVE
YOUR ROYALTY ON THOSE SALES.
AND WHAT DO I OWN
IN TERMS OF EQUITY, TOO?
OR ALL I GET IS A ROYALTY?
YOU GET THE ROYALTY.
SO NO EQUITY.
LIFE IS HARD, THEN YOU DIE.
BUT THE ROYALTY STREAM
IS??IS GROSS.
I PUT UP ALL THE MONEY.
I TAKE ALL THE RISKS.
I HAVE ALL THE OVERHEAD,
OKAY?
YOU JUST COLLECT A CHECK
EVERY WEEK. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL OR NOT?
I THINK IT'S GONNA
HAVE TO BE THE HARDEST DEAL
THAT I HAVE TO TURN DOWN.
THE, UH, 4% IS, UH,
IS SOMETHING THAT, UH,
IS NOT GONNA KEEP ME MOTIVATED
AS A PERSON.
AND I WANT TO
SEE THIS COMPANY GROW.
UNLESS IT'S SOME SORT
OF BETTER EQUITY, UM,
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TURN DOWN YOUR OFFER.
JONATHAN, I HAVE ONE LAST
COUNTERPROPOSAL. OKAY?
IT'S A DO?OR?DIE, OKAY?
I GOT IT.
UM, I WANNA LICENSE
ELEMENT BARS.
I'LL PUT UP THE $150,000,
AND YOU'LL RECEIVE
4% OF SALES FOREVER,
AND I WANNA OWN
35% OF THE COMPANY. OKAY?
IS THAT A DEAL
THAT YOU CAN DO?
IT SOUNDS NITPICKY,
BUT YOU GOTTA GET
TO MY NEGOTIATING RANGE.
MY NEGOTIATING RANGE IS 25%.
(sharks laughing)
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I LOVE HIM!
I?I'M SORRY. I??'CAUSE I HAVE
TO BE ABLE TO WALK AWAY??
THAT'S MY B. F. F.
JONATHAN, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT. I'M A FAIR GUY.
I WILL??I'LL SPLIT
THE 35% AND THE 25% AT 30%,
BUT THAT'S IT.
ALL RIGHT, 30%.
WE HAVE A DEAL.
OKAY. SUPER.
ALL RIGHT.
WHOA!
(Robert) WHOO!
OKAY, BUDDY.
IT WAS A PLEASURE.
GOOD, MAN.
COME OVER HERE, MAN. ROBERT,
GET OUT OF HERE. TAKE HIS SEAT.
YEAH, HERE, JONATHAN.
JONATHAN, SIT THERE.
(laughs) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD JOB, JONATHAN. LOOKING
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
I'M REALLY EXCITED.
THANK YOU. OKAY, ME, TOO.
OUTSTANDING,
YOU CRAZY CHICKEN.
I'M SO EXCITED.
I?I THINK WE ALL??IT WAS LONG.
IT WAS INTENSE.
UH, IT FELT LIKE IT WAS
TEETERING ON THE EDGE
FOR A WHILE,
BUT NOW I'M JUST EUPHORIC.
