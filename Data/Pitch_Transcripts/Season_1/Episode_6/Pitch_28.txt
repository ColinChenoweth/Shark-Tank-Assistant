I'M KIMBERLY CAYCE,
HI THERE.
I'M KIMBERLY CAYCE,
AND, KIMBERLY, DO YOU HAVE SALES
OR IS THIS A BRAND?NEW START?UP?
KIMBERLY, WHO'S THE LEADER
IN THIS MARKET RIGHT NOW?
THERE'S REALLY
FIVE KEY COMPETITORS??
THAT ARE ON THE MARKET.
BUT, KIMBERLY,
AS AN AVERAGE CONSUMER,
I WALK INTO A LARGE RETAILER.
I'VE GOT THESE FIVE COMPANIES
THAT SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TELLING ME THAT
THEY'RE THE BEST PRODUCT.
KIMBERLY, I SEE
TREMENDOUS COMPETITION,
SO... I'M OUT.
IF I TOOK $125,000 OF MY MONEY
THAT I WAITED ON TABLES FOR,
(Robert) KIMBERLY,
YOU'RE JUST STARTING OUT.
NOT ONLY ARE YOU GOING AFTER
THIS BIG A MARKET,
YOU'RE GOING AFTER THIS PART
OF??I... I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
KIMBERLY, THE PROBLEM IS
I'M NOT SURE THE WORLD NEEDS
ANOTHER SPORTS BRA.
THE TRUTH IS, YOU'RE
A NOTHING BURGER IN THIS MARKET.
NOTHING. YOU HAVE NOTHING.
