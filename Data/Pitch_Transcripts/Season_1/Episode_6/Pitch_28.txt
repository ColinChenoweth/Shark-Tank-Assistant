MY NAME IS BUCK WEIMER,
AND I AM PRESIDENT
OF UNDER?TEC CORPORATION,
AND WE MAKE PROTECTIVE UNDERWEAR
FOR FLATULENCE.
(laughs)
(laughs)
AND I'M ARLENE WEIMER,
AND I'VE BEEN WEARING UNDER?EASE
UNDERWEAR FOR FLATULENCE
FOR 15 YEARS.
SO WE ARE ASKING
FOR $55,000.
AND FOR THIS,
WE'RE WILLING TO GIVE YOU
A 25% STAKE IN OUR COMPANY.
FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE,
I'VE HAD CROHN'S DISEASE,
WHICH IS AN INFLAMMATORY
BOWEL SYNDROME
WITH EXCESSIVE BAD GAS.
SO IN 1991,
ON THANKSGIVING EVE,
AFTER A SUMPTUOUS MEAL,
BUCK AND I WERE LYING IN BED,
AND THE GAS WAS
PARTICULARLY UNBEARABLE.
SO AS THE ODORS WERE
REACHING MY NOSTRILS,
I BEGAN TO THINK OF WAYS
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
FOR ME PERSONALLY,
DIVORCE WAS NOT AN OPTION.
AND I HAD AN IDEA ABOUT
A PAIR OF PANTIES
THAT MAYBE COULD CONTAIN
THE SMELL.
SO AFTER MANY MONTHS OF
EXPERIMENTATION IN OUR CELLAR,
I HIT UPON
A PAIR OF UNDERWEAR
THAT ARE MADE
FROM AIRTIGHT MATERIAL,
WITH ELASTIC AROUND BOTH LEGS
AND CHARCOAL FILTERING
IN THE BACK/TUSH AREA.
(laughs)
IN 2001, WE OPENED OUR BUSINESS
WITH A WEB SITE.
MOST PEOPLE, UH,
LAUGHED A LOT,
AND, UM, HAD SOME QUESTIONS??
"UH, IS THIS FOR REAL?"
SO OF COURSE WE SAID,
"YES, IT IS FOR REAL."
BUT THIS HELPED US UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE WAS HUMOR
CONNECTED WITH OUR PRODUCT.
(sharks laugh)
VERY GOOD.
ARE THERE SALES SINCE 2001?
YES. LAST YEAR,
OUR ESTIMATED SALES
WERE $37,000.
HOWEVER, THE YEAR BEFORE,
WE HAD QUITE A BIT
OF ADVERTISEMENT.
WHAT WERE THE??
THE GROSS WAS OVER $67,000.
ARLENE, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW.
RIGHT.
WAS THAT
YOUR MOST SUCCESSFUL YEAR?
THE FIRST YEAR WAS, UM,
THE GROSS WAS $83,000.
$83,000. SO THE SALES HAVE
KIND OF BEEN GOING DOWN.
WELL, ACTUALLY, EVERY TIME
WE GET PUBLICITY,
WE KNOW THE SALES GO UP.
(Robert) SO, ARLENE,
HOW DOES THE PRODUCT WORK?
IS THAT A FILTER?
YES. TH?THESE ARE
A PAIR OF THE UNDERWEAR.
THEY'RE AIRTIGHT,
AND THEY HAVE??
BUT AREN'T THEY??ARE THEY
REALLY SNUG ON YOUR LEGS?
I'M WEARING THEM NOW.
THEY LOOK GOOD.
(laughs)
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING THESE FOR?
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING THEM FOR?
OKAY, SELLING PRICE IS $24.95
FOR THE UNDERWEAR.
FOR ONE.
FOR ONE PAIR OF UNDERWEAR
WITH A FILTER.
WITH A FILTER.
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I'M AT,
ARLENE AND BUCK.
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
A FANTASTIC JOB
FOR WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN
A VERY TOUCHY SUBJECT.
BUT THE MARKET IS SMALL.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
OKAY.
THIS IS REALLY A SUPPLY
TO A MEDICAL HOUSE
AND/OR MAIL ORDER,
AND SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
ARLENE,
I?I JUST DON'T SEE IT HERE,
SO I'M SORRY, BUT I'M OUT.
(Barbara) I THINK YOU SHOULD
PEDDLE HAPPY MARRIAGE.
YOU LOOK LIKE THE HAPPIEST
COUPLE I EVER SAW.
(laughs)
THANK YOU.
I'M SITTING HERE THINKING,
WOULD I RATHER HAVE GAS
AND WEAR MY SEXY UNDERWEAR?
OR WOULD I RATHER ELIMINATE
THE GAS
AND WEAR THAT UNDERWEAR?
AND I THINK I'D PICK
MY SEXY UNDERWEAR,
BECAUSE I THINK
I'D FEEL MEDICAL IN THOSE.
SO I'M OUT AS WELL.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB
ON A VERY, UH,
DIFFERENT KIND OF PRODUCT.
I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.
I HAVE TO SAY I'M OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
