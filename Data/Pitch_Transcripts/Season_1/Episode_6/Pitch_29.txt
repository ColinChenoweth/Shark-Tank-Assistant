I'M DAVID.
I'M A 51?YEAR?OLD TOYMAKER,
AND I HAVE A WIFE
AND TWO BEAUTIFUL KIDS.
EVERY GAME HAS A PLACE,
BUT THIS GAME'S PLACE
IS THE TRASH CAN.
(laughs)
I INVENT TOYS AND GAMES.
I LOVE WHAT I DO,
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A KID INSIDE.
THIS ISN'T AS KOOKY
AS SOME OF HIS OTHER ONES.
I'M VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT MY PRODUCT,
AND I'VE SPENT OVER $50,000
DEVELOPING IT.
(whoops)
I REALLY NEED THE SHARKS
TO INVEST IN MY PRODUCT.
THAT WAY I CAN RECOUP
MY INVESTMENT
AND PROVE TO MY WIFE
THAT I CAN SURVIVE
OFF MY SILLY INVENTIONS.
I'M DAVID CHODOSH,
AND MY PRODUCT IS CALLED
THE FIZZ.
I'M HERE TO RAISE $150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN THE PRODUCT.
I'M A TOYMAKER,
AND MY MISSION IS TO CREATE FUN,
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO FOOD.
I DISCOVERED
THAT THE ROOT BEER FLOAT
HAD REALLY BEEN LARGELY IGNORED
FOR 50 YEARS,
SO I WANTED TO WAKE UP
THAT SLEEPING GIANT,
AND I DID, BY CREATING THE FIZZ.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.
THE IDEA IS BUILT AROUND
THE BOTTLED SODA.
OPEN THE SODA...
AND A STRAW GOES INTO THE BOTTOM
OF THE FIZZ CUP.
THIS ONE'S PRELOADED
WITH ICE CREAM.
THE STRAW HELPS IT, UH, DRAW
THE SODA IN A LITTLE EASIER.
IT SCREWS ON TO THE TOP,
AND WHEN YOU SQUEEZE
THE SODA IN,
IT ACTUALLY STARTS TO FIZZ UP
INSIDE THE CUP.
AND IF YOU WERE IN THERE,
YOU COULD HEAR THE FIZZING.
(makes fizzing noise)
JUST LIKE THAT...
(makes fizzing noise)
AND YOU JUST DRINK.
(gulps) MMM.
THAT IS GOOD.
(laughs)
I KNEW YOU'D LOVE IT.
HOW DO WE??BUT HOW DO WE KNOW?
OH, WELL,
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED,
BECAUSE I BROUGHT ONE
FOR EACH OF YOU TO TRY.
(Robert) OH, AWESOME.
SO I HAVE ORANGE
AND ROOT BEER. IF YOU??
ROOT BEER.
ROOT BEER.
OKAY.
THANK YOU, DAVID.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
DAYMOND.
MM, GOOD.
YEAH, IT'S NOT BAD.
I THINK MY KIDS WOULD LOVE IT.
IT'S FUN.
DAVID, DO YOU HAVE SALES?
YES, I DO.
UH, LAST YEAR,
SALES WERE AROUND $84,000.
WHERE DID THE SALES
COME FROM?
ICE CREAM STORES, UH, VENDORS
AT, LIKE, STATE FAIRS.
I ALSO HAVE PROVIDED MANY OF
THEM AS PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS.
I SUPPLIED, UH, UH, COCA?COLA
WITH A, UM, AN ORDER.
SO WHAT DID COCA?COLA SAY
TO YOU?
THEY LOVED IT.
THEY WANTED TO ORDER THEM
FOR A, UH, GIVEAWAY PROMOTION.
AND?
AND, UH, BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY
IN THE ICE CREAM BUSINESS,
PER SE.
AH.
AND THE ICE CREAM
COMES FROM WHERE?
THE ICE CREAM IS PROVIDED BY
EITHER THE CUSTOMER HIMSELF,
WHO WOULD SCOOP IT IN AT HOME
OR IN
A BEST?POSSIBLE SCENARIO??
IS AN ICE CREAM MANUFACTURER
WHO WOULD PREFILL THESE
AND SELL THEM
IN THE FREEZER SECTION
IN??IN STORES.
NOW WHEN YOU WENT TO
THE ICE CREAM COMPANIES,
THEY SAID TO YOU...
I HAVEN'T REALLY DEMONSTRATED
BIG ENOUGH SALES
TO GET THEM INTERESTED.
BUT, DAVID,
FOR THIS TO BE BIG...
MM?HMM.
DAVID, I TELL YOU, I LOVE IT.
IT BRINGS BACK
MY TIME IN MY LIFE
WHEN I WAS JUST BEGINNING
TO THINK ABOUT MONEY.
DAVID, I TELL YOU, I LOVE IT.
IT BRINGS BACK MY...
TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS JUST
BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT MONEY.
(chuckles)
TO ME, THIS HAS TO BE BUNDLED
WITH ONE OF THE PRODUCTS
THAT IT USES.
AND I THINK
IT'S THE ICE CREAM.
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO INVEST IN IT.
AND SO WITH THE WARM,
FUZZY FEELINGS OF MY BOYHOOD...
I HAVE TO SAY, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
(Barbara) THANK YOU.
(Daymond) YEAH.
(sighs deeply)
