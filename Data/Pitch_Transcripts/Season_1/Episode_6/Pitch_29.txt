I'M KIMBERLY CAYCE,
AND MY COMPANY IS
KAYLX TECHNOLOGIES.
IT'S A BUSINESS THAT WAS CREATED
FOR WOMEN BY WOMEN.
I COMPETED AROUND THE WORLD
AS A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER
FOR FIVE YEARS.
MY EXPERIENCE
AS A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE
HAS TRULY INSPIRED ME
AND MY BUSINESS.
AFTER I RETIRED FROM MY CAREER
AS A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER,
I ALSO WENT THROUGH
A DIVORCE.
I REALLY FELT A NEED
TO REINVENT MYSELF.
I SPENT THREE YEARS
RESEARCHING OUR CONCEPT,
DEVELOPING OUR PROTOTYPES
AND BETA TESTING OUR PRODUCTS.
ALONG THE WAY,
INVESTORS HAVE COME AND GONE,
BUT RIGHT NOW MY COMPANY
IS REALLY RUNNING ON FUMES.
I'VE INVESTED ALMOST MY ENTIRE
LIFE SAVINGS INTO THIS COMPANY.
I MUST GET AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
OR I'M REALLY NOT SURE
HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO KEEP THE COMPANY
GOING FORWARD.
HI THERE.
I'M KIMBERLY CAYCE,
AND THESE ARE THE LOVELY LADIES
OF TEAM KAYLX.
MY COMPANY IS
KAYLX TECHNOLOGIES.
TONIGHT WE'RE SEEKING $125,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN OUR BUSINESS.
AT KAYLX TECHNOLOGIES,
WE BELIEVE
THAT WHEN A WOMAN EXERCISES,
BALLS ARE THE ONLY THING
THAT SHOULD BOUNCE.
(Robert laughs)
I KNOW THE SUBJECT
OF BOUNCING BREASTS
MIGHT BE LAUGHABLE
TO SOME PEOPLE,
HOWEVER, EXERCISE?INDUCED
BREAST PAIN IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM
THAT AFFECTS
MILLIONS OF WOMEN.
EVERY KAYLX SPORTS BRA
IS DESIGNED TO BE
AS FASHIONABLE, FEMININE,
FLATTERING
AS IT IS FUNCTIONAL.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
WE HAVE EIGHT BRAS IN OUR LINE.
EACH OF THESE BRAS
HAS BEEN ENGINEERED
TO WORK WITH A WOMAN'S BODY
DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE
OF ACTIVITY SHE ENJOYS.
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I MEAN.
FIRST UP IS
OUR ENLIGHTENED LINE OF BRAS.
THESE ARE COMFORTABLE
AND SUPPORTIVE
BUT THEY'RE
A LITTLE BIT SEXY.
NEXT UP
ARE OUR EXTREME LADIES.
THESE ARE BRAS DESIGNED
FOR WOMEN THAT LIKE TO GO FAST
AND AREN'T AFRAID TO FALL DOWN.
LAST UP ARE OUR ELITE ATHLETES.
THESE BRAS
ARE DESIGNED FOR WOMEN
THAT ARE GOING FOR THE GOLD.
EACH OF THESE BRAS INCORPORATES
OUR PATENTABLE
KAYLX POWER SLING,
A WIRELESS MESH INSERT DESIGNED
TO RESTRICT BREAST MOTION
ACROSS MULTIPLE PLANES,
MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR WOMEN
TO EXERCISE WITHOUT PAIN.
AND, KIMBERLY, DO YOU HAVE SALES
OR IS THIS A BRAND?NEW START?UP?
WE'RE A BRAND?NEW COMPANY.
WE HAVE BEEN ABOUT THREE YEARS
IN DEVELOPMENT.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A WAITING LIST
OF OVER 250 WOMEN
WHO ARE EAGER
TO BUY OUR PRODUCTS,
AND WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST ORDER,
UH, FROM A RETAIL STORE
A FEW DAYS AGO,
CALLED THE FULL CUP.
DO YOU HAVE A PROJECTION
OF WHAT YOUR SALES WILL BE
THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR?
WE??WE'VE HAD
A ROUGH GO OF IT.
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT
TO ADMIT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.
KAYLX IS REALLY
RUNNING ON FUMES RIGHT NOW.
I'VE PUT MY LIFE SAVINGS
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU PUT
INTO THIS?
I'VE PROBABLY PUT
OVER $100,000 OF MY OWN MONEY.
THERE ARE MANY,
MANY SPORTS BRAS OUT THERE.
THERE ARE MANY SPORTS BRAS.
I WAS WEARING SPORTS BRAS
THAT WOULD COME
ALL THE WAY UP MY CHEST
OR THAT WOULD SMASH MY BREASTS
INTO THIS AWFUL UNIBOOB.
THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE.
THEY WERE UNATTRACTIVE.
I DON'T HAVE TO PLAY LIKE A GIRL
BUT I CAN STILL LOOK LIKE ONE.
KIMBERLY, WHO'S THE LEADER
IN THIS MARKET RIGHT NOW?
THERE'S REALLY
FIVE KEY COMPETITORS??
CHAMPION, NIKE, UNDER ARMOUR,
ADIDAS AND MOVING COMFORT.
OH, THEY'RE NOT WELL?KNOWN.
WE DEFINITELY HAVE
OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US.
BUT BEFORE WE STARTED
DEVELOPING OUR PRODUCTS,
WE INTERVIEWED
OVER 250 WOMEN.
FOUND ABOUT 90%
OF THOSE WOMEN
ARE REALLY DISSATISFIED
WITH SPORTS BRAS
THAT ARE ON THE MARKET.
BUT, KIMBERLY,
AS AN AVERAGE CONSUMER,
I WALK INTO A LARGE RETAILER.
I'VE GOT THESE FIVE COMPANIES
THAT SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TELLING ME THAT
THEY'RE THE BEST PRODUCT.
AND HERE YOU ARE,
ON YOUR OWN, LITTLE COMPANY.
HOW IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GONNA
COMPETE AGAINST THOSE GUYS
THAT HAVE DISTRIBUTION,
HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN MARKETING,
AND EVERY WOMAN OUT THERE
KNOWS THEIR BRAND NAME?
WELL, FIRST, EVERY ONE
OF THOSE COMPANIES STARTED
RIGHT WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
I CAN'T DECIDE IF I'D RATHER
STICK NEEDLES IN MY EYES
OR GIVE YOU $125,000.
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE
TO GAIN ANY MARKET SHARE?
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON ANY OF THIS STUFF?
WE DON'T HOLD THE PATENT YET.
RIGHT NOW, AS I MENTIONED,
OUR COMPANY REALLY IS
RUNNING ON FUMES.
AND WE HAVE OUR PROVISIONAL
PATENTS READY TO FILE.
WHAT WOULD YOU USE THE MONEY
FOR, THE??THE $125,000?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT
WHEN YOU GET IT?
LARGEST PERCENTAGE
OF THAT MONEY
WOULD GO TOWARDS
OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS. UM??
BUT YOU HAVE NO ORDERS YET.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA MANUFACTURE?
WELL, THAT'S PART
OF OUR GO?TO?MARKET STRATEGY.
WE INTEND TO TAKE OUR PRODUCTS
DIR?DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMER
THROUGH OUR GO KAYLX
WEB SITE.
KIMBERLY, I SEE
TREMENDOUS COMPETITION,
SO... I'M OUT.
IF I TOOK $125,000 OF MY MONEY
THAT I WAITED ON TABLES FOR,
KILLED MYSELF
TO GET MY HANDS ON,
WHEN WOULD I SEE
THAT MONEY BACK?
MOST LIKELY BY YEAR FIVE.
BY YEAR FIVE.
MUCH TOO LONG FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY
FOR ME TO JUMP INTO THIS.
I'M OUT.
WELL, ONE THING
I CAN SHARE WITH YOU
IS THAT OUR BRAND IDENTITY
IS PRETTY STRONG. UM...
(Robert) KIMBERLY,
YOU'RE JUST STARTING OUT.
NOT ONLY ARE YOU GOING AFTER
THIS BIG A MARKET,
YOU'RE GOING AFTER THIS PART
OF??I... I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
KIMBERLY, THE PROBLEM IS
I'M NOT SURE THE WORLD NEEDS
ANOTHER SPORTS BRA.
THE TRUTH IS, YOU'RE
A NOTHING BURGER IN THIS MARKET.
NOTHING. YOU HAVE NOTHING.
AND $125,000 ISN'T GOING
TO GET YOU ANYTHING.
YOU NEED
HUGE MARKETING DOLLARS
TO MAKE THAT BRAND
EVEN MEAN ANYTHING.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE DEAD.
THIS IS OVER.
NOW YOU CAME HERE
TO HEAR THE TRUTH.
I JUST GAVE IT TO YOU.
BUT I CANNOT PUT MY MONEY
IN HARM'S WAY HERE.
THERE IS NO HOPE.
YOU'RE GOING TO ZERO WITH THIS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, ALL,
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
(Robert) THANK YOU.
(O'Leary) DON'T CRY.
THANKS. NO.
IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF SOMETHING ELSE
AND THE END OF THIS.
THAT'S YET TO BE SEEN.
