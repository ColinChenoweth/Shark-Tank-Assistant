MY NAME IS SAWYER SPARKS.
I'M 22 YEARS OLD.
(Robert) SAWYER??
MAYBE THAT'S TRUE,
BUT HOW MUCH
ARE THEY GOING
TO PURCHASE IT FOR?
THAT'S STILL IN NEGOT??
NEGOTIATION.
IS IT??DO YOU NEED SOME HELP
IN NEGOTIATING THAT?
YEAH.
HAVE THEY MADE YOU
AN ACTUAL OFFER?
UH, THROUGH MY LAWYERS,
BUT NOT...
WHAT WAS THEIR PRICE?
THERE'S BEEN
DIFFERENT OFFERS.
THE HIGHEST HAS BEEN AROUND
$500,000.
YOU HAD AN OFFER FOR $500,000?
YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT??
BUT I REALLY FEEL
THAT IN A YEAR,
TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD,
I CAN HONESTLY SELL
12 MILLION OF THESE CONTAINERS.
ARE YOU A WEALTHY GUY,
SAWYER?
NO.
DIDN'T THE $500,000??I'M JUST
CURIOUS??DIDN'T IT TEMPT YOU?
TEMPTED MY PARENTS, YES.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
YES. (laughs)
(laughs)
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA ABOUT
EMPLOYING PEOPLE?
I JUST FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE MY
FINGER ON YOUR MOTIVATION HERE.
MY MOTIVATION
IS TO CREATE JOBS,
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S
A PRODUCT FOR THESE??
ONE?EIGHTH OF THE MARKET??
PLAY?DOH CAN DO THAT.
NOT WITH
A WHEAT?FREE MAR??
YOU'RE SURE
YOUR PATENT EXCLUDES THEM
FROM EVER DOING
A WHEAT?FREE PRODUCT?
YES, YES.
SAWYER??OH.
SAWYER, I HAVE GREAT NEWS
FOR YOU.
THANK GOODNESS WE'VE MET.
MY WHOLE BUSINESS CAREER
WAS BUILT AROUND
LICENSING PROPERTIES.
DONE IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES.
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000
FOR 51% OF YOUR PATENT.
SAWYER SAID NO TO HALF A MILLION
IN CASH FROM PLAY?DOH.
BUT YOU'RE PROPOSING??
HE'S GONNA MAKE MUCH MORE
THAN HALF A MILLION
WHEN I'M YOUR PARTNER??
MUCH MORE, MUCH MORE.
BUT YOU'RE TAKING CONTROL.
HE'S??YES,
BECAUSE I SHOULD SIT??
SO YOU COULD SELL IT
FOR $600,000.
I DON'T??
THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO.
ROBERT, YOU'RE JUST
MAKING NOISE TO ME.
LOOK, KEVIN??
SAWYER, LET ME SWEETEN MY OFFER,
'CAUSE THIS IS NOISE.
I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT.
HERE'S A BETTER DEAL FOR YOU.
WE'LL KEEP IT THIS WAY??
51% AT $125,000,
WITH SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF.
SAWYER, IT'S A GREAT SPEECH...
SAWYER, I'M NOT??I'M NOT...
(Daymond) YOU HAVE
TWO OFFERS ON THE TABLE.
I'M NOT GONNA SELL YOU THAT
HARD. I DON'T FEEL I NEED TO.
RIGHT.
I THINK YOU'RE A SMART GUY.
I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
I THINK THAT, UH, YOU'RE
VERY CLEAR WITH WHAT YOU WANT.
WITH THAT OFFER, WHAT??WHAT IS
YOUR PLANS WITH THIS BUSINESS?
I MEAN, I THINK
THAT MY PLAN WITH IT
IS TO KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
IS MY OFFER OFF THE TABLE,
SAWYER?
NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO ME
IS THAT
WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN
THE PATH TO NEGOTIATE A LICENSE.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO ME.
RIGHT.
IF YOU ALLOW HIM TO NEGOTIATE
ON YOUR BEHALF WITH 51%,
I'LL GO DOWN THAT ROAD.
I'LL PUT IN ANOTHER $125,000.
LET'S DO THIS. EACH OF US
IS GOING TO PUT IN $100,000,
FOR A TOTAL OF $300,000
FOR 51% OF THE COMPANY.
