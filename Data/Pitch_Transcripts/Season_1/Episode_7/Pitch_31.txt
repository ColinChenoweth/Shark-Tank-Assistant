(laughs)
LESLIE, I WANT IN
ON THAT DEAL.
OH! (laughs) OH!
(man) ? THE BEST THINGS
IN LIFE ARE FREE ?
? BUT THAT AIN'T REALLY
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ?
? I NEED MONEY ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
(exhales deeply)
I AM LESLIE HAYWOOD,
STAY?AT?HOME WIFE AND MOTHER,
AND I CREATED A PRODUCT
FOR ANYONE THAT LOVES GRILLING.
WITH ALL OF THIS GOING ON,
IT IS HARD TO KEEP TRACK
OF EVERYTHING ON THE GRILL.
OKAY, WHO HAD
THE SPICY CHICKEN?
BUT MY PRODUCT IS THE SOLUTION
TO EVERY GRILLER'S PROBLEM.
WHEN I AM NOT BUSY BEING
SHORT?ORDER COOK,
HEAD NOSE?WIPER, TAXI DRIVER,
I AM VERY BUSY
BEING FOUNDER, PRESIDENT,
C.E.O., MARKETING GURU
AND BOOKKEEPER
FOR MY GRILLING GADGET EMPIRE.
I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN OUT
TO "SHARK TANK" ONCE BEFORE,
AND RIGHT BEFORE I WAS GETTING
READY TO WALK IN THE SHARK TANK,
I GOT A CALL FROM MY MOM.
(voice breaking) AND MY FATHER
HAD PASSED AWAY VERY SUDDENLY
AND UNEXPECTEDLY.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, UM,
ONE OF THE LAST THINGS
HE SAID WAS,
HE ASKED MY MOM
NOT TO CALL ME...
(normal voice) BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
WANT TO BE THE REASON
WHY I MISSED OUT
ON THIS OPPORTUNITY.
I HAD TO COME HOME,
AND WE HAD TO BURY HIM.
IT WAS
THE MOST DEVASTATING THING
I HAD EVER BEEN THROUGH.
A FEW WEEKS LATER,
I GOT THIS CALL
FROM THE "SHARK TANK,"
SAYING THAT I GOT
THIS SECOND CHANCE.
WHEN I WALK OUT THERE,
I KNOW THAT HE WILL BE WITH ME,
AND HE WILL BE CHEERING FOR ME
THE WHOLE WAY.
I'M LESLIE HAYWOOD,
CREATOR OF GRILL CHARMS.
I'M SEEKING $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
WHERE I COME FROM,
WE GRILL YEAR?ROUND.
NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
EVER HAD THIS PROBLEM,
BUT WHEN YOU GO TO A COOKOUT
OR A BARBECUE,
AND YOU SERVE A PLATTER
FULL OF FOOD,
A LOT OF TIMES, YOU CAN'T TELL
WHICH IS WHICH.
YOU CAN'T TELL WHICH ONE IS RARE
AND WHICH ONE'S MEDIUM RARE.
OR MAYBE YOU HAVE
A SPICY PIECE OF CHICKEN,
BUT YOU WEREN'T PREPARED FOR IT,
AND IT LIGHTS YOU ON FIRE.
OR MAYBE YOU HAVE HEALTH
OR ALLERGY CONCERNS.
WELL, I HAVE INVENTED A PRODUCT
CALLED GRILL CHARMS
THAT SOLVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS
AND MORE.
THEY ARE
SOLID STAINLESS STEEL CHARMS
THAT YOU PUT IN YOUR FOOD
<i>BEFORE</i> YOU GRILL.
THERE'S FOUR COLLECTIONS
FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES.
THE STEAK COLLECTION, WHICH IS
"MR" FOR MEDIUM RARE,
THEN YOU HAVE MEDIUM WELL,
ETCETERA.
THEN FOR THE SPICY COLLECTION,
YOU HAVE A PICTURE
OF A PEPPER ON FIRE
IF YOU LIKE IT HOT.
AND THEN THERE'S
TWO OTHER COLLECTIONS
FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES.
WHERE DO YOU SELL THEM?
I'M IN, UH, 103 INDEPENDENT,
UH, RETAIL STORES
ACROSS THE U. S.,
CANADA AND SWEDEN.
WHO DOES THE SELLING?
I'M DOING THE SELLING.
(laughs)
SHE COULD SELL ANYTHING.
YOU'RE??YOU'RE A SORT OF
ONE?MAN SHOP, SO TO SPEAK.
I AM.
COULD WE SEE A SAMPLE
WHILE YOU'RE SPEAKING TO US?
OH, ABSOLUTELY. SURE, SURE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY,
LESLIE?
WELL, I JUST STARTED HERE, SO
THIS PAST YEAR WE DID $60,000.
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA
ABOUT THE PASSION
AND DETERMINATION,
I WENT FROM
SPICY LIGHTBULB MOMENT??
LITERALLY AT A DINNER PARTY
THAT I HOSTED??
TO HAVING MY PRODUCT ON STORE
SHELVES IN A YEAR AND A HALF.
IN BETWEEN THAT TIME,
I HAD A LITTLE RUN?IN WITH
BREAST CANCER AT THE AGE OF 34,
SO THAT SLOWED ME UP
JUST A LITTLE BIT.
WHOA! THAT SLOWED YOU UP
JUST A LITTLE BIT.
YES, BUT EVEN THAT
DIDN'T STOP ME.
(Barbara) LESLIE,
WHAT DOES THIS SELL FOR?
6 CHARMS??THAT RETAILS
IN STORES FOR $19.95.
IT'S THE PERFECT GIFT ITEM.
SO YOU'VE GOT
THE GRILLING INDUSTRY,
THE GIFTING INDUSTRY,
THEN WE HAVE THE LICENSING.
EVERY SPORTS TEAM,
EVERY TAILGATER,
NEEDS THEIR OWN SET.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GRILLS
GEORGE FOREMAN SOLD,
BY THE WAY?
100 MILLION GRILLS.
OKAY? SO GRILLING IS??
IS HUGE, RIGHT?
IT IS HUGE.
IT IS HUGE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE $50,000?
I AM GONNA USE THAT TO REALLY
WHOMP UP AT TRADE SHOWS,
'CAUSE IF YOU WANT TO RUN
WITH THE BIG DOGS,
YOU HAVE GOT TO??
YOU GOTTA BARK.
AND THAT'S
WHAT I NEED TO DO.
EITHER THAT, OR OH, DIRECT
TO TV, YOU KNOW... (laughs)
I GOT MY??
I GOT MY EYE ON YOU.
(O'Leary) YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
YOU GOT SOMETHING HERE.
THE CHALLENGE??
IT'S??IT'S NOT A??
IT'S??IT'S NOT REALLY
A COMPANY YET.
IT'S A PRODUCT,
AND ONE THAT'S WORKING.
WELL, IT'S FUNNY. I KNOW
A GUY WHO'S GOOD AT THAT.
SO...
(laughs)
BUT WAIT A SECOND, ROBERT.
YOU INTERRUPTED ME, AND I WAS
ABOUT TO MAKE AN OFFER.
(gasps)
OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET IN THE WAY OF YOUR OFFER.
GO AHEAD AND MAKE THE OFFER.
SILENCE, PLEASE.
UM, I WAS SORT OF TENDERIZING
YOU FOR MY OFFER.
I THINK WHAT I WOULD DO
IS I'D GIVE YOU $50,000
FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS
OR THE PRODUCT,
WHICH IS
ALL IT IS RIGHT NOW.
MM?HMM.
UM, I'M GONNA PUT
A 7% ROYALTY ON IT.
LESLIE.
YES.
I WOULDN'T TAKE HIS OFFER.
I CAN BEAT THE OFFER.
I CAN BRING MORE TO THE TABLE.
OKAY? 'CAUSE HE'S??
HE SAYS, "IT'S NOT A BUSINESS,
IT'S A PRODUCT."
RIGHT. RIGHT.
A PRODUCT IS A BUSINESS.
RIGHT.
MY OFFER IS??
YOU NEED THE MONEY,
BUT YOU NEED THE EXPERTISE.
AND I HAVE THE EXPERTISE
IN DEVELOPING THE TELEVISION,
THE INFOMERCIAL SIDE.
BUT I WOULD SAY I WOULD
GIVE YOU THE $50,000.
FORGET THE ROYALTY. BUT I DO
WANT 50% OF THE COMPANY.
LESLIE, I WANT IN
ON THAT DEAL.
(Leslie gasps)
KEVIN, I'M NOT SURE
YOU NEED ME,
BUT MAYBE I COULD PUT UP
MORE THAN HALF THE MONEY,
'CAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF
THE BEST IDEAS WE'VE SEEN.
SO, KEVIN, WILL YOU LET ME IN
ON THAT DEAL IF I PUT UP...
$30,000 OF THE MONEY
AND WE EACH GET 25%?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.
BEFORE THEY START
COLLUDING TOGETHER ON THE DEAL,
UM, I DO BELIEVE
THAT KEVIN??THE NICE KEVIN??
IS??
(Leslie laughs)
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME
AGAIN?
(sharks chuckle)
IS THE BEST PERSON
TO DO THE DEAL.
ROBERT HAS NO IDEA
ABOUT HOW TO SELL TO RETAILERS.
YOU KNOW, YOU EVER GO INTO
A STORE AND YOU SEE
"AS SEEN ON TV"?
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
OKAY. SO THAT IS WHERE
MY ABILITY IS.
SO THIS COULD BE
IN STORES AS WELL.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO COME IN HALF,
AND, UM,
YOU DON'T NEED BAD KEVIN
OR PRETTY ROB...
(laughs)
IN THE DEAL.
WHY, THANK YOU FOR
CALLING ME PRETTY, DAYMOND.
THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME BAD.
WOW.
I'D LIKE TO GET??
(Barbara) I JUST WANT
TO CLEAR THE FIELD A LITTLE.
I LOVE THE IDEA. YOU HAVE
FOUR GROWN MEN ROMANCING YOU,
HALF BECAUSE YOUR PRODUCT
IS GREAT,
AND HALF BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO DAMN PRETTY.
(all laugh)
BARBARA, I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE
HOW PRETTY SHE WAS.
I'M SURE NOT.
I AM JUST ENAMORED
WITH THE PRODUCT. SO, KEVIN...
I'M OUT.
HARRINGTON.
YES.
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. YOU'VE
KICKED ME OUT OF THE DEAL?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE? 'CAUSE
I WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE.
UM...
I WANT PART OF THIS DEAL.
I HAVE TO SAY THIS, OKAY?
I'M GONNA DO THE TELEVISION.
DAYMOND CAN DO THE RETAIL.
AND IT??AND I DON'T THINK
A THIRD PARTNER
IS GONNA MAKE SENSE HERE.
OH, FORGET THAT.
LESLIE, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE 50 GRAND FOR 25%,
EXACTLY LIKE YOU ASKED.
AND NO ASSISTANCE.
(Harrington chuckles)
HE WILL GIVE YOU
NO ASSISTANCE, LESLIE.
OH! (laughs) OH!
LESLIE, THERE'S OTHER
TV GUYS OUT THERE.
HE DOESN'T OWN THE MONOPOLY
FOR STUFF TO FLOG ON TV.
SO YOU GET 75% OF A SMALL PIE
WITH ROBERT.
YOU GET 50% OF A BIG PIE
WITH ME AND DAYMOND.
THEY BARELY LET HIM
IN RETAIL STORES TO SHOP...
(laughs)
LET ALONE??LET ALONE
PUT SOME PRODUCT IN THERE.
I AM DISGUSTED
BY YOUR GREED.
I AM DISGUSTED BY IT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY OFFER?
WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER
OVER HERE?
I DON'T LIKE THE ROYALTIES.
LESLIE, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
WHEN YOU STARTED
YOUR BUSINESS...
YES.
DID YOU START IT
TO GIVE UP HALF OF IT?
I BUILT MY BUSINESS
OUT OF MY HOUSE
WITH CREDIT CARDS BY MYSELF...
RIGHT.
AND SOLD IT FOR $150 MILLION,
WHICH MAY BE SMALL TO KEVIN,
BUT I OWNED 100% OF IT.
LESLIE, WE ALL DID THAT.
LESLIE, LISTEN TO ME
FOR A SECOND.
THESE NUMBERS
ARE ROUNDING ERRORS.
I SOLD MY BUSINESS
FOR $3.2 BILLION.
AND THAT'S WHY HE'S TRYING
TO SCREW YOU ON A ROYALTY.
ABSOLUTELY NOT. NOISE, NOISE.
THIS STUFF IS ROUNDING ERRORS.
ALL RIGHT, LESLIE,
WE HAVE TWO DEALS...
OKAY.
'CAUSE WE ALL KNOW
KEVIN'S DEAL IS A WASTE OF TIME.
NO, IT ISN'T.
WE ALL KNOW KEVIN??OKAY.
SO WE HAVE THREE DEALS.
WELL, THIS IS??
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
I MEAN, OF COURSE
I CAME OUT HERE,
AND I WAS GUNNIN' FOR YOU.
I?I MEAN, REALLY.
I'M VERY SAD TO HEAR THAT.
THAT IS WHO
I INITIALLY THOUGHT
MY PRODUCT WOULD BE
A PERFECT FIT FOR.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
YOU GUYS HAVE JUST REALLY,
REALLY GIVEN ME
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.
I THINK
I DO NEED TO STEP OUTSIDE
AND MULL THIS OVER
JUST FOR A MINUTE.
(Harrington) OKAY, PLEASE DO.
OKAY.
WE WANT YOU TO MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
YOU'RE PRESSURING HER.
THAT IS ONE TOUGH WOMAN.
(telephone ringing)
Hello?
HI, HON.
GOOD NEWS, I THINK. (laughs)
I'VE GOT, UM,
ALL OF THE SHARKS,
UH, BUT ONE
FIGHTING OVER ME.
A COUPLE OF 'EM WANT
50% OF THE BUSINESS,
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I'M WILLING TO GIVE UP
THAT MUCH CONTROL.
AND THEN I'VE GOT ANOTHER SHARK
THAT WILL GIVE ME
EXACTLY WHAT I'M ASKING FOR,
BUT HE DOESN'T BRING
ENOUGH TO THE TABLE.
EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY
THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BUDGE,
I GOTTA GIVE IT ONE MORE SHOT.
I NEED THAT NUMBER TO COME DOWN
JUST A LITTLE BIT.
YOU'RE LIKE
LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
GIGGLING ABOUT THE PRETTY GIRL.
(Robert) THAT IS
ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
I STILL??I REALLY HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THE 50%.
LESLIE, HANG ON. ARE YOU
SAYING NO TO MY OFFER?
NO, NO, NO.
BUT I DO WANT THIS OFFER.
IT'S THE 50% THAT'S KILLING ME,
'CAUSE I REALLY??THE EXPERTISE,
IT IS THERE.
IT REALLY IS THERE.
I'M GETTING THIS STRANGE FEELING
YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
I... (laughs)
I <i>DO</i> LIKE YOU.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THAT I CAN WORK WITH YOU.
(sharks laugh)
OH!
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I LIKE HER EVEN MORE!
FINALLY, SOMEBODY'S
BEING HONEST.
COME ON.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
NO. Y?YEAH.
MY OFFER IS??IS 50%.
THERE IS NO OTHER OFFER.
THERE IS NO OTHER OFFER?
NO. THAT'S THE DEAL.
49?
NO, I CAN'T.
IT'S 50 OR NO DEAL.
I WOULD BE THE SAME??
50 OR NO DEAL.
YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?
MY OFFER STILL STANDS, LESLIE,
'CAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
ANYBODY THAT COMES FROM
THEIR HOUSE AS A HOUSEWIFE,
STARTS ALL THIS,
BEATS CANCER ALONG THE WAY,
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
THIS IS ALL NOISE.
1% IS MINISCULE, OKAY? 'CAUSE
WE'RE??WE'RE EQUAL PARTNERS.
DON'T??DON'T LET 1%
BLOW THE DEAL.
HARRINGTON'S GONNA DUMP YOU
LIKE A COLD POTATO
IF THE PRODUCT DOESN'T SELL.
YOU KNOW THAT.
ENOUGH CHATTER.
LET'S DO IT.
WAIT. JUST BEFORE...
JUST BEFORE
YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION...
YOU'RE OUT.
NO, NO. I'M NOT FINISHED.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $50,000
FOR 20% OF THE BUSINESS
WITH MY ROYAL??
OOH!
WITH MY ROYALTY STRUCTURE
IN PLACE, AND YOU'RE??
THE FULL CONFIDENCE, BECAUSE
I WILL NOT BE A CONTROL PARTNER.
LESLIE, WHY DON'T YOU TELL
THIS GUY HE'S OUT?
YOU CAN'T STAND HIM.
GET RID OF HIM.
(laughs) OH, I D??
LESLIE, YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT YOU
WHILE YOU WERE OUT THERE?
SHE SAID THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE TALKING TO YOU IS
'CAUSE YOU'RE A PRETTY WOMAN.
AND I FOUND THAT INSULTING.
I FOUND THAT INSULTING.
SHE'S SEXIST.
BARBARA!
YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
(Robert) MAKE A DECISION.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
I DO. I DO.
I JUST??I DIDN'T GET
THIS FAR GIVING UP MY BABY.
AND I JUST CAN'T GIVE IT UP.
(Leslie) OH.
UNBELIEVABLE.
OHH.
UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
YOU SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP 50%.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I JUST CAN'T. I CAN'T.
(Robert) YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN'T DO IT.
UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT A SURPRISE.
THANKS, LESLIE.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY
TO SCREW ME OVER, HARRINGTON.
OHH. (laughs)
I WENT IN THERE
GOING FOR KEVIN HARRINGTON,
'CAUSE I??HE'S THE TV GUY.
THAT'S??THAT'S WHO??
WHO I THOUGHT THAT I NEEDED.
BUT THEN ROBERT, UH,
I JUST CONNECTED WITH HIM,
AND I REALLY THINK THAT HE HAS
MY BEST INTERESTS AT HEART,
AND, UH, I SO LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH HIM.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
SHE MADE A CRAZY,
WRONG DECISION.
SHE DID NOT MAKE
A POOR DECISION.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT I HAVE SOLD
$6 BILLION WORTH OF PRODUCT
AROUND THE WORLD?
AND, WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE IMPRESSED BY THAT?
YOU'RE BOTH BOZOS. I'M GONNA
CALL HER UP AND DO IT FOR 10%.
(laughs)
I?I WILL... SAY YES.
YES.
AHA. SHE'S GONNA SAY NO,
HUH, DAYMOND? HUH?
I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT AFTER
GOING INTO THE SHARK TANK
TO SAVE
MY GOURMET FOOD BUSINESS,
SALES HAVE SKYROCKETED.
THE SHARKS EVEN GOT ME
ON THE HOME SHOPPING NETWORK.
WE HAD 1,600 UNITS SOLD
IN ONE DAY.
I MADE THE CINNAMON PEAR JELLY
FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
I MEAN, IT WAS GREAT.
(laughs)
OH, MY GOSH.
BEFORE BEING ON "SHARK TANK,"
MY SALES
WERE ONLY $8,000 A MONTH.
NOW THEY'RE
OVER $80,000 A MONTH.
(Harrington)
SUSAN IS A REAL PROFESSIONAL.
SHE'S BUILT
A HECK OF A BUSINESS.
AND THIS BUSINESS
IS GONNA TAKE OFF.
