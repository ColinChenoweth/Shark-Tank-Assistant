WELL, I JUST STARTED HERE, SO
THIS PAST YEAR WE DID $60,000.
YES, BUT EVEN THAT
DIDN'T STOP ME.

I WOULDN'T TAKE HIS OFFER.
I CAN BEAT THE OFFER.

(Leslie gasps)
KEVIN, I'M NOT SURE

MORE THAN HALF THE MONEY,
'CAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF
THE BEST IDEAS WE'VE SEEN.

(Leslie laughs)
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME
AGAIN?

TO DO THE DEAL.
ROBERT HAS NO IDEA
ABOUT HOW TO SELL TO RETAILERS.
(Harrington chuckles)
HE WILL GIVE YOU
NO ASSISTANCE, LESLIE.
OH! (laughs) OH!
LESLIE, THERE'S OTHER
TV GUYS OUT THERE.
HE DOESN'T OWN THE MONOPOLY
FOR STUFF TO FLOG ON TV.
SO YOU GET 75% OF A SMALL PIE
WITH ROBERT.
LESLIE, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
WHEN YOU STARTED
YOUR BUSINESS...
YES.
DID YOU START IT
TO GIVE UP HALF OF IT?
I BUILT MY BUSINESS
OUT OF MY HOUSE
WITH CREDIT CARDS BY MYSELF...
RIGHT.
BUT I OWNED 100% OF IT.
LESLIE, WE ALL DID THAT.
LESLIE, LISTEN TO ME
FOR A SECOND.
THESE NUMBERS
ARE ROUNDING ERRORS.
I SOLD MY BUSINESS
FOR $3.2 BILLION.
ALL RIGHT, LESLIE,
WE HAVE TWO DEALS...
OKAY.
'CAUSE WE ALL KNOW
KEVIN'S DEAL IS A WASTE OF TIME.
NO, IT ISN'T.
WE ALL KNOW KEVIN??OKAY.
SO WE HAVE THREE DEALS.
WELL, THIS IS??
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
I MEAN, OF COURSE
I CAME OUT HERE,
LESLIE, HANG ON. ARE YOU
SAYING NO TO MY OFFER?
NO, NO, NO.
BUT I DO WANT THIS OFFER.
IT'S THE 50% THAT'S KILLING ME,
'CAUSE I REALLY??THE EXPERTISE,
IT IS THERE.
IT REALLY IS THERE.
I'M GETTING THIS STRANGE FEELING
YOU DON'T LIKE ME.
I... (laughs)
I <i>DO</i> LIKE YOU.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THAT I CAN WORK WITH YOU.
(sharks laugh)
OH!
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I LIKE HER EVEN MORE!
FINALLY, SOMEBODY'S
BEING HONEST.
COME ON.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
NO. Y?YEAH.
MY OFFER IS??IS 50%.
THERE IS NO OTHER OFFER.
THERE IS NO OTHER OFFER?
NO. THAT'S THE DEAL.
49?
NO, I CAN'T.
IT'S 50 OR NO DEAL.
I WOULD BE THE SAME??
50 OR NO DEAL.
YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?
LESLIE, WHY DON'T YOU TELL
THIS GUY HE'S OUT?
LESLIE, YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT YOU
WHILE YOU WERE OUT THERE?
SHE SAID THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE TALKING TO YOU IS
'CAUSE YOU'RE A PRETTY WOMAN.
(Leslie) OH.
UNBELIEVABLE.
OHH.

YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
YOU SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP 50%.
