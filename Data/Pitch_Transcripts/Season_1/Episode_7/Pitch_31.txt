MY NAME IS SAWYER SPARKS.
I'M 22 YEARS OLD.
I'M FROM BLOOMFIELD, INDIANA,
AND I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT.
MY FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE,
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROFESSORS
AND HER 5?YEAR?OLD CHILD
MENTIONED THAT THEY HAD
CELIAC DISEASE,
WHICH MEANS
THEY WERE ALLERGIC TO WHEAT.
BECAUSE OF THIS ALLERGY,
HER CHILD COULD NOT PLAY WITH
THE TRADITIONAL MODELING CLAY,
LIKE PLAY?DOH,
THAT WE ALL GREW UP WITH
BECAUSE THEY ALL CONTAIN WHEAT.
SO I CREATED SOY?YER?DOUGH,
A WHEAT?FREE, SOY?BASED
MODELING CLAY.
WELCOME TO
THE WORLD HEADQUARTERS
OF SOY?YER?DOUGH
IN MY MOM'S KITCHEN.
AND THIS IS MY MOM SUE.
SHE DOES ALL THE KNEADING.
THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND SAMMIE,
WHO DOES ALL THE MIXING.
AND I DO ALL THE STIRRING
HERE AT THE STOVE.
AND WE DO THIS DAY IN
AND DAY OUT,
EVERY DAY WITH ORDERS.
THIS BUSINESS
ISN'T JUST ABOUT MAKING MONEY.
IT'S ABOUT HELPING
ALL THE PEOPLE
IN THE COMMUNITY
THAT I GREW UP WITH.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YES, THANK YOU.
GLAD TO SEE YOU COME HOME.
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO
IS EXPAND MY BUSINESS,
OPEN UP A FACTORY
IN BLOOMFIELD, INDIANA,
AND CREATE JOBS
IN MY COMMUNITY.
MY NAME IS SAWYER SPARKS,
AND MY PRODUCT IS SOY?YER?DOUGH.
I'M ASKING FOR
A $125,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 25% OF MY COMPANY.
THE TRADITIONAL MODELING CLAY
THAT WE ALL GREW UP WITH
IS WHEAT BASED,
WHICH CAUSES CHILDREN
WITH AN AVERSION TO WHEAT
TO FEEL COMPLETELY LEFT OUT.
SO I INVENTED SOY?YER?DOUGH??
THE FIRST AND ONLY
PATENTED MODELING CLAY
THAT IS GLUTEN?FREE,
NONTOXIC AND FUN?SCENTED.
OH, IT SMELLS LIKE CHERRY.
YES, AND IT SMELLS BEST
IF YOU BREAK 'EM APART.
WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF THE CHILDREN POPULATION
HAVE THIS PROBLEM?
ACTUALLY, 1 IN 8 CHILDREN.
OUR COMPETITOR SELLS
96 MILLION CONTAINERS
OF THIS SIZE A YEAR.
ONE?EIGHTH OF THAT IS
12 MILLION CONTAINERS PER YEAR.
SO THERE'S A HUGE MARKET
FOR THIS.
HOW??HOW MUCH OF THIS
HAVE YOU SOLD SO FAR?
WE HAVE SOLD 8,000 CONTAINERS
SINCE FEBRUARY.
UH, THAT'S WHEN THIS BEGAN,
AND WE JUST LAST WEEK GOT
AN ORDER FOR 11,000 CONTAINERS.
WOW.
THE 8,000 YOU SOLD WERE
A RESULT OF YOUR ONLINE SALES?
ONLINE SALES.
HOW PROPRIETARY
IS THIS PRODUCT?
IS THERE A PATENT
OF ANY KIND ON IT?
YES, MINE. IT HAS
A PROVISIONAL PATENT ON IT.
WHERE ARE YOU
MANUFACTURING THIS?
OUT OF MY KITCHEN
AT HOME, ACTUALLY.
H?HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?
UH, IT'S MY MOM,
ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND??
YOU JUST COOK IT YOURSELF?
WE JUST
COOK IT OURSELVES, YES.
WE CAN ONLY MAKE 12 CONTAINERS,
UH, PER 10 MINUTES.
HAVE YOU APPROACHED
ANY TOY MAKERS?
WE HAVE AN OFFER??
HAVE YOU TRIED TO
LICENSE THIS TO PLAY?DOH?
I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED
BY PLAY?DOH, THOUGH.
FOR WHAT?
ABOUT??ABOUT THIS,
TO PURCHASE IT.
WAIT. WAIT.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
AND WHAT DID THEY HAVE TO SAY?
THEY LOVE IT, THEY WANT IT,
AND WE'RE??
WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING
BECAUSE THEY WANT
THIS PATENT.
SO THE LARGEST PLAYER
IN THE SPACE CONTACTED YOU...
MULTIPLE TIMES.
TO LICENSE YOUR PATENT.
SORRY. MULTIPLE TIMES?
MULTIPLE TIMES.
AND WHERE IS THAT NEGOTIATION
AT THIS POINT?
AT THIS POINT, I WANT TO
CREATE JOBS IN MY COMMUNITY??
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.
YOU WANT TO SIT
IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN TABLE
BAKING THIS STUFF,
WHEN THE NUMBER ONE GUY
IN THE WORLD IS CALLING YOU?
ARE YOU NUTS?
NO, HE WANTS
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
TO SIT IN HIS MOTHER'S KITCHEN
BAKING THIS STUFF.
WHY WOULD YOU BAKE
ONE MORE CUP OF THIS STUFF
WHEN THE NUMBER ONE GUY ON EARTH
IS BANGING AT YOUR DOOR?
BECAUSE I??
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT
FOR YOU,
'CAUSE IT'S GONNA TELL ME
WHETHER YOU'RE SANE OR INSANE.
NO, BECAUSE HONESTLY,
I REALLY FEEL THAT IF THEY
PURCHASE THIS PATENT FROM ME,
WE WOULD NEVER SEE IT AGAIN
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
(Robert) SAWYER??
MAYBE THAT'S TRUE,
BUT HOW MUCH
ARE THEY GOING
TO PURCHASE IT FOR?
THAT'S STILL IN NEGOT??
NEGOTIATION.
IS IT??DO YOU NEED SOME HELP
IN NEGOTIATING THAT?
YEAH.
HAVE THEY MADE YOU
AN ACTUAL OFFER?
UH, THROUGH MY LAWYERS,
BUT NOT...
WHAT WAS THEIR PRICE?
THERE'S BEEN
DIFFERENT OFFERS.
THE HIGHEST HAS BEEN AROUND
$500,000.
YOU HAD AN OFFER FOR $500,000?
YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT??
BUT I REALLY FEEL
THAT IN A YEAR,
TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD,
I CAN HONESTLY SELL
12 MILLION OF THESE CONTAINERS.
ARE YOU A WEALTHY GUY,
SAWYER?
NO.
DIDN'T THE $500,000??I'M JUST
CURIOUS??DIDN'T IT TEMPT YOU?
TEMPTED MY PARENTS, YES.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
YES. (laughs)
(laughs)
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA ABOUT
EMPLOYING PEOPLE?
I JUST FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE MY
FINGER ON YOUR MOTIVATION HERE.
MY MOTIVATION
IS TO CREATE JOBS,
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S
A PRODUCT FOR THESE??
ONE?EIGHTH OF THE MARKET??
PLAY?DOH CAN DO THAT.
NOT WITH
A WHEAT?FREE MAR??
YOU'RE SURE
YOUR PATENT EXCLUDES THEM
FROM EVER DOING
A WHEAT?FREE PRODUCT?
YES, YES.
OUTSTANDING, YOUNG MAN.
OUTSTANDING.
I RARELY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE
THIS FROM THE LICENSE FRONT.
THIS IS
A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY.
THANK YOU.
SAWYER??OH.
SAWYER, I HAVE GREAT NEWS
FOR YOU.
THANK GOODNESS WE'VE MET.
MY WHOLE BUSINESS CAREER
WAS BUILT AROUND
LICENSING PROPERTIES.
DONE IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES.
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000
FOR 51% OF YOUR PATENT.
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHY I'M DOING THAT.
I'M DOING IT...
TO TAKE YOU
OUT OF THE EQUATION.
AND I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'LL GET A BETTER DEAL
THAN THE ONE
YOU'RE GETTING RIGHT NOW
WHEN I SIT DOWN
WITH YOUR FRIENDS AT PLAY?DOH.
SAWYER SAID NO TO HALF A MILLION
IN CASH FROM PLAY?DOH.
BUT YOU'RE PROPOSING??
HE'S GONNA MAKE MUCH MORE
THAN HALF A MILLION
WHEN I'M YOUR PARTNER??
MUCH MORE, MUCH MORE.
BUT YOU'RE TAKING CONTROL.
HE'S??YES,
BECAUSE I SHOULD SIT??
SO YOU COULD SELL IT
FOR $600,000.
I DON'T??
THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO.
ROBERT, YOU'RE JUST
MAKING NOISE TO ME.
LOOK, KEVIN??
SAWYER, LET ME SWEETEN MY OFFER,
'CAUSE THIS IS NOISE.
I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT.
HERE'S A BETTER DEAL FOR YOU.
WE'LL KEEP IT THIS WAY??
51% AT $125,000,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLOSE
UNTIL I FINISH THE NEGOTIATIONS
WITH THESE GUYS.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE DEAL,
WALK AWAY.
I'M GONNA BE
YOUR ADVOCATE RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT LICENSING,
BUT HONESTLY,
I THINK HE IS GIVING YOU
AN INCREDIBLE DEAL.
I'D CONSIDER THIS
WHAT WE CALL A "YOLO" MOMENT.
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.
ALL RIGHT?
YES.
AND TO MAKE SURE
THAT I DON'T COMPETE,
'CAUSE I THINK THAT IS
A REALLY GOOD DEAL...
I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA GET RID
OF THE CLUTTER.
UM, I THINK A SPECIALIST
IN LICENSING
LIKE KEVIN O'LEARY IS??
IS A GOOD PARTNER TO HAVE,
SO I??I'M GONNA BOW OUT.
OKAY.
HE'S THE NATURAL PARTNER
FOR YOU,
AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE GUY,
SO FOR ME TO ENDORSE HIM
IS SHOCKING TO MYSELF.
I'M OUT.
SO YOU JUST WANT TO RAISE
SOME CASH TO DO WHAT?
UH, TO BUILD A FACILITY
IN MY COMMUNITY.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MY FRIEND,
I'VE BEEN RICH
AND I'VE BEEN POOR.
RICH IS MUCH BETTER,
AND I WANT TO GET YOU THERE.
YOU'LL FIND MANY WAYS
TO CREATE JOBS
WHEN YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL
TO BUILD BUSINESS.
COULD I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
YES.
HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE MONEY?
DO YOU LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DO?
PROBABLY NOT.
I'M STILL IN COL??
I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT AND...
(laughs)
I JUST NEED MONEY
FOR BEER, I GUESS,
IS WHAT THIS IS.
(sharks laugh)
(O'Leary)
THIS IS SUCH WHAT I DO.
THIS IS IN MY BLOOD,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.
THERE'S NO PERSON
BETTER ON EARTH
TO BE IN YOUR SHOES THAN ME.
BELIEVE ME. WE NEED TO BE
PARTNERS ON THIS.
ARE WE GONNA BE IN BUSINESS
OR NOT?
I LOVE YOUR OFFER.
AND I DEFINITELY FEEL
THAT I DO NEED HELP,
UH, WITH THIS, AND, UH,
BUT NOT FOR 51%.
WITH SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF.
SAWYER, IT'S A GREAT SPEECH...
AND IT'S TRUE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SAWYER?
I ALMOST BELIEVED
IT FOR A SECOND.
BUT I THINK YOU DID
AN EXCELLENT JOB TODAY
OF SEEING THROUGH
THE FLUFFINESS
AND INTO WHAT IT REALLY IS,
JUST GREED.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $125,000
FOR THE 40%.
SO WE'RE??WE'RE??
(whimpers) I'M GONNA CRY.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
WHAT'S YOUR??
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT. HE'S NEVER, EVER??
I'VE DONE WHAT I'VE
JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU
A HUNDRED TIMES, AND THE PROOF
IS IN THE PUDDING.
MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT
I NEED??I NEED OWNERSHIP.
I DON'T WANT OWNERSHIP.
WHAT I WANT IS THE ABILITY
TO CLOSE.
WITH 51%.
I??
YOU CAN'T CLOSE IF YOU
OWN LESS THAN 51?
LIKE, THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE SENSE?
NO, IT DOES MAKE SENSE.
THE REASON YOU DON'T KNOW THIS
IS YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT,
WHICH IS WHY HIS OFFER
IS USELESS TO YOU.
OKAY.
YOU NEED A GUY
THAT'S ACTUALLY DONE IT.
SAWYER, I'M NOT??I'M NOT...
(Daymond) YOU HAVE
TWO OFFERS ON THE TABLE.
I'M NOT GONNA SELL YOU THAT
HARD. I DON'T FEEL I NEED TO.
RIGHT.
I THINK YOU'RE A SMART GUY.
I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
I THINK THAT, UH, YOU'RE
VERY CLEAR WITH WHAT YOU WANT.
WITH THAT OFFER, WHAT??WHAT IS
YOUR PLANS WITH THIS BUSINESS?
I MEAN, I THINK
THAT MY PLAN WITH IT
IS TO KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
NEGOTIATE HARD WITH PLAY?DOH
AND TRY TO GET MONEY.
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED
BY WHAT YOU'VE BUILT.
IT'S $125,000.
WE DO BOTH??
NEGOTIATE WITH PLAY?DOH,
KEEP SELLING IT.
I MEAN, YOU SOLD 11,000 UNITS.
IT'S??IT'S REMARKABLE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
SO YOU HAVE
TWO DEALS ON THE TABLE.
ONE WHO WANTS TO CONTROL
YOUR COMPANY,
THE OTHER ONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT LICENSING.
YOU KNOW,
THE??THE??THE PROBLEM...
AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN
ABOUT THE 51%,
AND I'M??I'M STRUGGLING,
BECAUSE??
IF THE 51%
WITH YOU CAN'T CHANGE,
THEN GIVE ME
A BETTER MONEY OFFER.
IS MY OFFER OFF THE TABLE,
SAWYER?
NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO ME
IS THAT
WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN
THE PATH TO NEGOTIATE A LICENSE.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO ME.
RIGHT.
IF YOU ALLOW HIM TO NEGOTIATE
ON YOUR BEHALF WITH 51%,
I'LL GO DOWN THAT ROAD.
I'LL PUT IN ANOTHER $125,000.
LET'S DO THIS. EACH OF US
IS GOING TO PUT IN $100,000,
FOR A TOTAL OF $300,000
FOR 51% OF THE COMPANY.
AND YOU KNOW
<i>WHY</i> IT HAS TO BE 51%.
THAT'S THE OFFER.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
