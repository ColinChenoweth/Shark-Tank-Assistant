I WANT TO GO ON YOUR BACK.
(Dede) AFTER HAVING
MY??MY THIRD BABY,
I WEIGHED OVER 200 POUNDS,
IT'S KATHY FROM BOOGIE BOX.
I WAS INTRODUCED TO DEDE
BY A MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCE,
HI, I'M DEDE.
SO YOU'RE GETTING TWICE
THE WORKOUT IN HALF THE TIME.
DEDE, THAT DOESN'T LOOK
THAT EASY TO DO.
BUT NOW IT GETS TOUGH, DEDE.
BUT I JUST PROVED
THAT YOU CAN DO IT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES
RIGHT NOW?
NOT FOR THE DVD PORTION
OF OUR BUSINESS, NO.
WE DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE
A D??
FOR ANY PORTION, ANY PORTION.
THERE IS ANOTHER PART
OF OUR BUSINESS
THAT IS CERTIFYING INSTRUCTORS,
TEACHING LIVE CLASSES,
DOING WORKSHOPS
FOR OUR STUDENTS.
THAT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, YES.
WE HAVE BEEN GROWING THAT.
WE LAUNCHED THAT
IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR.
KATHY, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
YOU'RE SELLING ME ONLY THE DVD.
'CAUSE YOU??YOU SAID THAT
VERY SPECIFICALLY.
YES, YES.
(Robert) KATHY, ISN'T THERE
ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD DO THIS
INSTEAD OF BURNING THROUGH
$700,000?
YOU KNOW, IS IT A GO BIG
OR GO NOTHING PROPOSITION?
WE FEEL THAT THE RETURN
IS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY
IF WE PUT THAT INVESTMENT IN
UPFRONT ON THE SALES.
(Robert) YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO GIVE YOU $700,000,
KATHY, IS THAT
THE ONLY MODEL??$700,000?
IT'S LIKE A FEATURE FILM.
IT'S A CRAPSHOOT.
WE HAVE ALIGNED OURSELVES
WITH PRODUCERS
WHO HAVE WORKED
WITH ALL OUR COMPETITORS.
THEY DO.
THEY FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
AT WHAT WE'RE GONNA SELL...
DEDE CREATED THIS.
THIS IS HER CREATION.
AFTER HAVING MY THIRD BABY,
I WAS 204 POUNDS.
I USED TO BE
A PROFESSIONAL DANCER
(woman) OKAY.
(Kathy) OKAY.
WELL, WE THANK YOU.
(O'Leary)
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
