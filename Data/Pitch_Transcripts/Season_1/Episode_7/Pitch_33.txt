I'M DEDE BARBANTI.
AND I'M KATHY LAMM.
AND WE ARE FROM
LADERA RANCH, CALIFORNIA.
I WANT TO GO ON YOUR BACK.
(Dede) AFTER HAVING
MY??MY THIRD BABY,
I WEIGHED OVER 200 POUNDS,
AND, UM, I SEPARATED
FROM MY HUSBAND.
IT WAS A REALLY,
REALLY BAD TIME IN MY LIFE.
ELBOWS ARE OUT.
I NEED A WAY
TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN,
SO I TOOK ALL MY TRAINING
AND DANCING
IN MARTIAL ARTS,
AS A CHOREOGRAPHER,
AND I PUT TOGETHER
BOOGIE BOX FITNESS.
IT'S KATHY FROM BOOGIE BOX.
I WAS INTRODUCED TO DEDE
BY A MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCE,
AND I IMMEDIATELY
FELL IN LOVE
WITH WHAT SHE HAD
PUT TOGETHER,
AND I WANTED TO GET
BOOGIE BOX FITNESS OUT
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.
HERE WE GO.
WE WANT TO SHOW THE WORLD
THAT IF TWO MOMS
CAN FULFILL THEIR DREAMS
AND PROVIDE
FOR THEIR CHILDREN??
IF WE CAN DO IT,
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
ANYBODY CAN. YEAH.
HI, I'M DEDE.
I'M THE C. E. O. AND CREATOR
OF BOOGIE BOX FITNESS.
AND I'M KATHY.
I'M DEDE'S BUSINESS PARTNER
AND I AM
THE CHIEF OPERATOR OFFICER
OF BOOGIE BOX FITNESS.
WE ARE LOOKING FOR $700,000
TO LAUNCH OUR HOME DVD LINE.
IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT FUNDING,
WE ARE PREPARED TO OFFER
A 70% SHARE
IN OUR HOME DVD BUSINESS.
WHAT YOU JUST SAW WAS
A VERY SMALL SAMPLE
OF A BOOGIE BOX FITNESS
WORKOUT.
IT'S A FUSION OF HIP?HOP,
LATIN DANCE, KICKBOXING,
PLYOMETRIC MOVEMENTS
AND HARD?CORE
RESISTANCE TRAINING ALL IN ONE.
SO YOU'RE GETTING TWICE
THE WORKOUT IN HALF THE TIME.
DEDE, THAT DOESN'T LOOK
THAT EASY TO DO.
COME OVER HERE,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW.
(Barbara laughs)
ABSOLUTELY.
OKAY, I'M GONNA
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
I'M A FIT GUY. I WAS ON
THE BIKE THIS MORNING.
OH, OKAY.
THESE SHARKS WERE NOT.
AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL,
ABOUT APPLIED MUSCLE RESISTANCE,
OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE USING
YOUR OWN BODY WEIGHT...
YEAH.
IN AN APPLIED MANNER??
BOY, YOU ARE REALLY BUILT.
WHOA.
DON'T TOUCH THE TALENT, KEVIN.
OKAY, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO...
OKAY.
ABS TIGHT.
I WANT YOU TO PRETEND
YOU HAVE WEIGHTS
IN YOUR HAND, OKAY?
YEAH, I'VE GOT IT.
OKAY, GRAB THOSE WEIGHTS,
AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
IS THE SAME THING??
PUT YOUR ELBOWS OUT,
AND SQUEEZE 'EM BACK DOWN.
YEAH.
PUT 'EM OUT
AND SQUEEZE 'EM BACK DOWN.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO FASTER.
AND UP AND DOWN. UP AND DOWN.
DEDE, IT LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER
WHEN YOU DO IT.
(sharks laugh)
THERE YOU GO. WHOO! THERE.
THAT'S CALLED KICK BUTT.
THIS IS HOW I KEEP
MY ADONIS FIGURE IN SHAPE.
YOU ARE DEFINITELY BUILT LIKE
A GOD??BUDDHA, TO BE EXACT.
(sharks laugh)
I'M GONNA GO SIT DOWN
AND TALK ABOUT MONEY NOW.
THAT WAS FUN...
OKAY, GO SIT OVER THERE.
BUT NOW IT GETS TOUGH, DEDE.
BUT I JUST PROVED
THAT YOU CAN DO IT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES
RIGHT NOW?
NOT FOR THE DVD PORTION
OF OUR BUSINESS, NO.
WE DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE
A D??
FOR ANY PORTION, ANY PORTION.
THERE IS ANOTHER PART
OF OUR BUSINESS
THAT IS CERTIFYING INSTRUCTORS,
TEACHING LIVE CLASSES,
DOING WORKSHOPS
FOR OUR STUDENTS.
THAT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, YES.
WE HAVE BEEN GROWING THAT.
WE LAUNCHED THAT
IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR.
KATHY, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
YOU'RE SELLING ME ONLY THE DVD.
'CAUSE YOU??YOU SAID THAT
VERY SPECIFICALLY.
YES, YES.
OKAY.
AND THE REASON WE DID THAT
IS THAT WE BELIEVE 80% TO 90%
OF OUR OVERALL REVENUE
IS GOING TO COME
DIRECTLY FROM THE DVD SALES.
AND WHAT??WHAT REVENUE,
IF ANY,
COMES FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE BUSINESS TODAY?
UH, YEAR TO DATE,
OUR REVENUE IS $15,000.
WHAT KIND OF FOLLOWING
DO YOU HAVE?
BECAUSE THIS IS, AS OF
RIGHT NOW, ANOTHER DANCE FORMAT.
WHERE IS THE FOLLOWING
AND/OR PROOF THAT YOU HAVE
THAT THIS WORKS?
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING
THAT'LL HELP PROVE...
THIS IS BRENDA. BRENDA WAS
A MEMBER OF OUR TEST GROUP.
(Robert) HI, BRENDA.
BRENDA HAS LOST
100 POUNDS HERSELF
WITHIN SIX MONTHS
OF DOING BOOGIE BOX.
(Barbara) WOW.
(Robert) WOW.
AND IF THAT DOESN'T...
THAT'S IMPACTFUL.
SHE FITS IN ONE LEG NOW.
(Robert) THAT'S AMAZING.
(Daymond) THAT IS GREAT.
(O'Leary) LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY
FOR A MINUTE.
OKAY.
IF I WAS GOING TO BE
PUTTING OUT $700,000??
I LIKE THAT
JUST FLOWING OFF MY LIPS,
'CAUSE IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT
OF MONEY??
YES, IT IS.
I'D HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
HOW I'D GET THAT BACK.
OUR SALES, CONSERVATIVELY,
WE HAVE ESTIMATED TO SELL
ONE MILLION UNITS
OVER THREE YEARS.
WE'VE COMPARED THAT TO WHAT
OUR COMPETITORS HAVE DONE??
BUT STOP RIGHT THERE.
THEY SPENT A FORTUNE
PREPARING AN INFOMERCIAL
AND THEN BUYING
THE MEDIA TIME??
AND THAT'S WHERE THE $700,000
COMES IN RIGHT THERE??
THE MEDIA TIME.
YEAH, BUT YOU WANT TO MOVE
A MILLION CDs.
SOME OF THE TOP
RECORD ARTISTS TODAY
ARE NOT MOVING
THAT AMOUNT OF CDs,
AND THAT'S JUST MUSIC
TO LISTEN TO.
$700,000??IT'S A VERY HARD
NUMBER FOR ME TO HIT
NOT KNOWING THIS BUSINESS.
SO I WOULD UNFORTUNATELY
HAVE TO SAY...
THAT I'M OUT.
HOW MUCH IS THE PRODUCTION
OF THE INFOMERCIAL?
$175,000.
(Robert) KATHY, ISN'T THERE
ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD DO THIS
INSTEAD OF BURNING THROUGH
$700,000?
YOU KNOW, IS IT A GO BIG
OR GO NOTHING PROPOSITION?
WE FEEL THAT THE RETURN
IS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY
IF WE PUT THAT INVESTMENT IN
UPFRONT ON THE SALES.
(Robert) YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO GIVE YOU $700,000,
AND WE HAVE NO WAY TO KNOW
IF IT'S GOING TO WORK
UNTIL THE MONEY'S GONE.
SO I EITHER...
GET MY MONEY BACK
OR I GET ZERO.
IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH.
AND I'M NOT WILLING
TO RISK MY MONEY
IN THAT BIG A LEAP OF FAITH.
I'M OUT.
KATHY, IS THAT
THE ONLY MODEL??$700,000?
IT'S LIKE A FEATURE FILM.
IT'S A CRAPSHOOT.
WE HAVE ALIGNED OURSELVES
WITH PRODUCERS
WHO HAVE WORKED
WITH ALL OUR COMPETITORS.
THEY DO.
THEY FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
AT WHAT WE'RE GONNA SELL...
VERY.
AND VERY COMFORTABLE
AT OUR PROJECTIONS.
I BELIEVE THERE'S A CRIME
CALLED MURDERING MONEY.
IF I GAVE YOU $700,000
AND YOU KILLED IT,
THEN I WOULD GO
INTO MONEY HELL.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
(mouths word)
OKAY.
YOUR WORKOUTS ARE GREAT,
BUT THERE IS NO BRAND HERE YET.
SO I HAVE TO SAY, I'M OUT.
HOW DID YOU EVEN
THINK OF THE BUSINESS?
I'M SO CURIOUS.
DEDE CREATED THIS.
THIS IS HER CREATION.
AFTER HAVING MY THIRD BABY,
I WAS 204 POUNDS.
I USED TO BE
A PROFESSIONAL DANCER
FOR MANY YEARS,
AND A CHOREOGRAPHER,
AND I STOPPED WHEN I HAD
MY FIRST CHILD.
AND I JUST WAS NOT
AT HAPPY PLACE IN MY LIFE.
SO, UM... I'VE USED ALL MY
TRAINING AS A CHOREOGRAPHER
AND A FIGHTER,
AND I LOST ALL THE WEIGHT.
IT TOOK ME 7 MONTHS TO LOSE
65 POUNDS DOING THIS FORMAT.
IT'S WORKED ON ME,
IT'S WORKED ON BRENDA,
AND IT'S CHANGING
EVERYBODY'S LIVES??
NOT JUST THEIR BODIES,
BUT THEIR LIVES.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT WHAT I'M HEARING.
I LOVE THE BRAND NAME.
BOOGIE BOX??SO COOL.
I ALSO LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE 100% GENUINE,
FROM YOUR STORY
TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
TO HOW GENUINELY
YOU'RE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS.
(woman) OKAY.
(Kathy) OKAY.
WELL, WE THANK YOU.
(O'Leary)
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
