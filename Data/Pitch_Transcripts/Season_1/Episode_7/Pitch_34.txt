I'M TODD ROBBINS.
AND I'M DAVID ADAMOVICH.
WE'RE HERE FOR $300,000
AT A 20% EQUITY
IN THE FUNHOUSE.
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU HAVE AN IDEA
FOR SOMETHING NEW
AND EXCITING,
I WISH
FINDING THE MONEY FOR IT
WOULD BE AS EASY AS,
WELL, LIKE THAT.
BUT, OF COURSE, IT'S NOT,
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
NOW AS YOU CAN GUESS, I HAVE
A LITTLE BACKGROUND IN MAGIC.
I'M ALSO
A SIDESHOW PERFORMER.
AND, DAVID, WHY DON'T YOU
LET THEM KNOW WHO YOU ARE?
I'M KNOWN
AS THE GREAT THROWDINI.
I AM THE WORLD'S FASTEST
AND MOST?ACCURATE KNIFE THROWER.
SO I'LL JUST GIVE YOU...
WOW.
A LITTLE SAMPLE
OF WHAT I DO.
(Barbara) JEEZ.
WOW. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
WOW.
(David) THANK YOU.
I WANT TO DO THAT? CAN I
STAND THERE AND YOU DO THAT?
SURE.
(O'Leary)
YOU'RE GONNA STAND THERE?
(Todd and David
speaking indistinctly)
YOU ARE NUTS, DAYMOND.
(Harrington) WOW.
LOOK AT HIM.
LET'S GO.
OH. AAH!
(sharks laughing)
OH! MOMMY!
(O'Leary) MORE!
UH?OH! YEAH!
OH. (laughs)
OOH!
I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.
YOU DID GREAT.
SCARY. (laughs)
(Harrington speaking
indistinctly)
YOU ARE A MAJOR NUT BALL.
(Robert) THROWDINI,
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
LAST YEAR, 35 MILLION PEOPLE
CAME TO THE TIMES SQUARE AREA
IN NEW YORK CITY.
SO WE ARE STARTING UP
A 25,000?SQUARE?FOOT,
UH, LIVE ENTERTAINMENT
AND AMUSEMENT ATTRACTION
CALLED THE FUNHOUSE
IN THE TIMES SQUARE AREA.
25,000 SQUARE FEET
IN THE MIDDLE OF NEW YORK?
YEAH, YEAH.
ARE YOU GUYS NUTS?
UNH?UNH. NO.
NO.
THERE ARE FIVE AREAS??
VENUES GOING ON
IN THE, UH, FUNHOUSE
THAT HAVE LIVE ENTERTAINMENT.
AND WE HAVE
A VAUDEVILLE CAFé.
THIS IS A 200?SEAT RESTAURANT
THAT FEATURES A STAGE
WITH, UH, WORLD?CLASS
VARIETY ENTERTAINERS??
JUGGLERS, PLATE SPINNERS,
ACROBATS, KNIFE THROWERS.
WE HAVE AN OLD?STYLE SIDESHOW
FEATURING SWORD SWALLOWING,
FIRE EATING.
A LOUNGE AREA THAT HAS
MAGICIANS DOING CLOSE?UP MAGIC??
CARDS, COINS, TRICKS??
OKAY, WE GET IT.
HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST?
HOW ARE WE GONNA MAKE MONEY?
OKAY,
IT'S VERY, VERY SIMPLE.
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE THAT
ALL FOR A $15 ADMISSION PRICE.
WE ANTICIPATE THAT IN
THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION,
IT'S GONNA GROSS
$9.4 MILLION.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
ATTRACT CUSTOMERS?
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
FIRST, THE??THE EXTERIOR OF
THE??THE VENUE WILL BE SUCH
THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO
FIND IT IF THEY KNOW ABOUT IT.
SO WALK?BY TRAFFIC?
YEAH, IT'S ALL FOOT TRAFFIC.
WHAT'S IT GONNA COST YOU
TO BUILD THAT WHOLE FA??
25,000 SQUARE FEET?
WE'VE CAPITALIZED THE START?UP
ON IT AS ABOUT $1.5 MILLION.
(Robert) WOW.
WHAT IS IT GONNA COST YOU
TO STAY OPEN EACH MONTH
ONCE THAT 1 AND A HALF
IS IN?
WELL, THE??THE ANNUAL EXPENSE
IS... IT'S SIZEABLE. IT IS??
(Robert) WHAT IS IT?
$7.4 MILLION.
YOWZA.
WOW.
YEAH. YEAH.
(O'Leary) WHOA.
THE PITCH
IS TO BUY INTO A BUSINESS
AND JUST HOPE LIKE CRAZY
THEY BUY THE TICKETS.
YEAH.
LIKE, YOU COULD JUST SIT THERE,
HUDDLE AROUND THE FIRE AND GO,
"PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN.
PLEASE. I BELIEVE! I BELIEVE!"
AND IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
IN TODAY'S MARKET?
YOU SHOULD JUST THROW KNIVES
AT EACH OTHER, REALLY.
I'M OUT.
IT??IT'S NOT ACTUALLY
A MILLION AND A HALF, KEVIN.
BARBARA UNCOVERED IT.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM
THE MILLION AND A HALF,
OR THEY HAVE TO GET IT,
THEN YOU'RE ON THE HOOK
FOR THE $7.4 MILLION.
THIS IS A HUGE RISK,
AND NOT KNOWING WHETHER
THE MODEL WORKS OR NOT,
IS??IS JUST WAY TOO RISKY
FOR ME. I'M OUT.
TO ME, IT'S A COIN TOSS.
I DON'T LIKE TO TAKE
THAT KIND OF A RISK,
SO I'M OUT.
I THINK
YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING
A LARGE COST THAT WE HAVEN'T
DISCUSSED HERE AT ALL.
I'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT
THE BRANDING OF IT,
WHICH I THINK IS KEY,
SO I'M SO FEARFUL YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE A LOT OF MONEY.
SO I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING??
THE HIGHER
A MONKEY CLIMBS A TREE,
THE MORE YOU SEE HIS ASS.
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR LISTENING TO US.
DAVID, YOU HAD A KNIFE
IN FRONT OF YOU.
OF COURSE WE WOULD LISTEN.
EXACTLY, YEAH.
(David) AH, WELL.
GOOD LUCK.
THEY WERE SCARED. IT SEEMED
LIKE THEY WERE SCARED.
I MAY BE READING THAT WRONG,
BUT...
UH, THEY SEEMED WIMPS.
I'M SORRY.
BOY, THAT WAS SO RISKY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?
YOU PUT UP A MILLION
AND A HALF DOLLARS,
AND THE NEXT DAY, IT'S GONE.
I DID LEARN SOMETHING, THOUGH.
I LEARNED HOW TO THROW KNIVES.
WHAT WAS THE KEY, KEVIN?
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU NOW,
ROBERT, WHAT I FIGURED OUT.
BARBARA, PLEASE,
BE MY GUEST.
NO, THANK YOU. PRACTICE.
YOU KNOW THOSE EARRINGS?
I'LL PIN THEM TO THE WOOD.
(Barbara and Daymond) WHOA!
