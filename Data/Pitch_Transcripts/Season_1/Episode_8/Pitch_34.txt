HI. MY NAME IS LISA LLOYD,
LISA, WHY AREN'T YOU
IN A LARGE RETAIL STORE?
THE RIGHT MANUFACTURER.
BUT, LISA, WHY CAN'T YOU GO
TO A LARGE MASS RETAILER
WITH THOSE THREE GUYS?
BECAUSE I'M UNDERCAPITALIZED.
I'VE GONE, I THINK,
AS FAR AS I CAN WITHOUT
THE NEXT INFUSION OF CASH.
(Daymond) HOW MUCH MORE
INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE REMAINING?
I HAVE ABOUT, UH,
1,100 PIECES LEFT,
LISA, IF I INVESTED
IN A TOY BUSINESS AGAIN,
I WOULD WAKE UP
WITH NIGHTMARES.
YOU'VE DONE A TERRIFIC JOB
OF PRESENTING IT,
LISA, THIS IS
WHERE I HAVE THE ISSUE??
WHEN IT'S AGE?SPECIFIC...
MM?HMM.
YOU KNOW, 3 TO WHAT?
14.
14, OKAY.
MM?HMM.
SO THAT'S??THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A NICHE PRODUCT.
OTHER THAN THE OTHER NICHE,
WHICH IS SEASONAL,
THIS IS A?A CHRISTMASTIME?TYPE
PRODUCT,
LISA, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY?
LISA,
I WOULD BE
VERY COMFORTABLE INVESTING...
BUT ONLY $50,000,
WHICH CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY,
BUT ALSO A PROBLEM FOR YOU.
BUT I MUST HAVE
MY THIRD SHARE OF 50%.
(Robert) HANG ON, LISA.
I THINK THIS IS ALL CRAP.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE BEING
AS NICE TO YOU
AS THEY THINK THEY ARE.
SO I THINK LISA NEEDS
TO DECIDE.
SO THIS IS
THE LOAN SHARK TANK?
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
WHY DON'T WE LET HER DECIDE,
DAYMOND?
I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF ALL I NEED IS MONEY,
THAT THIS WOULD BE
THE BEST WAY TO GO??
A LINE OF CREDIT??
IF I ONLY NEEDED MONEY.
UM, BUT IF I ONLY NEEDED
MONEY, I'D NEED A LOT MORE
THAN $150,000.
SO I THINK WHAT'S IN THE BEST
INTEREST OF THIS COMPANY
