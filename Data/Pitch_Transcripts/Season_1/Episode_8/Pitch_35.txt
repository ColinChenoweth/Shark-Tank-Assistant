MY NAME IS LISA LLOYD,
AND I'M FROM TUCSON, ARIZONA.
MY COMPANY IS CALLED
TREASURE CHEST PETS,
AND IT'S THE NEXT,
BEST PLUSH TOY LINE.
I LIVE WITH MY HUSBAND
AND THREE CHILDREN,
MY MOTHER?IN?LAW,
FATHER AND STEPMOM.
IT'S A VERY FULL HOUSE,
TO SAY THE LEAST.
I PERSONALLY HAVE INVESTED
ABOUT $100,000
AND LEVERAGED ALL MY CREDIT
FOR THIS BUSINESS.
MY HOUSE IS EVEN IN DANGER
OF FORECLOSURE.
MY ENTIRE FAMILY IS COUNTING ON
THIS BUSINESS
BECOMING A SUCCESS.
IT'S BECOME
MORE AND MORE STRESSFUL,
AND I HAVE CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP
MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.
WITHOUT THE INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS,
I CAN'T FILL THE ORDERS I HAVE,
AND MY FAMILY COULD LOSE
OUR HOME REAL SOON.
HI. MY NAME IS LISA LLOYD,
AND MY COMPANY IS CALLED
TREASURE CHEST PETS.
I AM SEEKING $150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
TREASURE CHEST PETS
IS A NEW, PATENTED LINE
OF AWARD?WINNING ORGANIZERS
THAT LOOK LIKE STUFFED ANIMALS
FOR CHILDREN.
THE PUPPY HERE HAS A PILLOW
THAT ATTACHES MAGNETICALLY
WITH DIFFERENT
SECRET SPACES INSIDE.
SHE HAS POCKETS
IN BOTH OF HER EARS,
A SECRET DRAWER
THAT'S HIDDEN BEHIND THE PILLOW,
AND POCKETS ALSO
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BODY
FOR STORING MORE GOODIES.
WHEN THEY'RE ALL DONE PLAYING
AND STORING, THEY PUT 'EM
RIGHT BACK TOGETHER,
AND IT'S LIKE A SECRET.
THE MONKEY HERE'S REAL POPULAR
WITH THE BOYS.
HIS PILLOW HEAD ALSO ATTACHES
MAGNETICALLY.
THIS ONE OPENS UP LIKE
A TREASURE CHEST INSTEAD.
THEY'RE MADE OF FOAM,
AND THAT'S HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY
MAINTAINING THEIR SHAPE
AND THE CONTINUITY OF A TOY
WHILE DOING THE FUNCTION
OF AN ORGANIZER.
OKAY, SO WHAT ARE
THEY GONNA RETAIL FOR?
$19.99.
WHAT DO THEY COST TO MAKE?
$4.75.
ARE YOU SELLING THEM TODAY?
I AM. I'M IN
ABOUT 200 STORES NOW.
WE JUST LAUNCHED. ACTUALLY,
I STARTED TESTING IN THE MALL.
I SOLD 600 PIECES BY MYSELF??
WORKING VERY LONG HOURS??
AT $30 TO $19.99, TE?TESTING
DIFFERENT PRICE POINTS.
HOW MUCH SALES HAVE YOU DONE
IN ONE YEAR, THE PAST YEAR?
ABOUT $100,000.
LISA, WHY AREN'T YOU
IN A LARGE RETAIL STORE?
BECAUSE YOU'VE GONE TO THEM,
AND THEY'VE SAID TO YOU, WHAT?
THERE'S THREE BOX RETAILERS
THAT SELL 60% OF THE TOYS
IN THIS COUNTRY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU AND I KNOW BOTH KNOW THIS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?
WHAT'D THEY SAY TO YOU?
I HAVE NOT BROUGHT IT
TO ANY MASS RETAILERS.
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON
THE BOUTIQUES FOR TWO REASONS.
NUMBER ONE, I HAVEN'T HAD
THE CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO GROW
THE COMPANY AT THAT RATE,
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO PUT MY CART BEFORE MY HORSE.
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
WE HAD THE RIGHT PRODUCT,
THE RIGHT MANUFACTURER.
BUT, LISA, WHY CAN'T YOU GO
TO A LARGE MASS RETAILER
WITH THOSE THREE GUYS?
BECAUSE I'M UNDERCAPITALIZED.
I'VE GONE, I THINK,
AS FAR AS I CAN WITHOUT
THE NEXT INFUSION OF CASH.
(Daymond) HOW MUCH MORE
INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE REMAINING?
I HAVE ABOUT, UH,
1,100 PIECES LEFT,
AND I GET ORDERS EVERY DAY.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE PIECES
ARE GONNA SELL THROUGH?
THEY'RE ALREADY SOLD.
I HAVE A STACK OF ORDERS
SITTING ON MY DESK
FOR FOURTH QUARTER
THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN PUT
IN THE SYSTEM YET.
YOU KNOW, ENGRAINED IN MY MIND
LIKE A LASER ARE THESE NUMBERS.
TOYS??$30 BILLION.
PLUSH??$2 BILLION.
I KNOW THIS MARKET INSIDE OUT.
I ALSO KNOW HOW BRUTAL IT IS
TO GET DISTRIBUTION.
LISA, IF I INVESTED
IN A TOY BUSINESS AGAIN,
I WOULD WAKE UP
WITH NIGHTMARES.
YOU'VE DONE A TERRIFIC JOB
OF PRESENTING IT,
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION
IN MY MIND
THAT THIS IS A GIANT
DISTRIBUTION JIGSAW PUZZLE.
FOR ME, IT'S NOT A PLACE
I WANT TO BE IN. I'M OUT.
LISA, THIS IS
WHERE I HAVE THE ISSUE??
WHEN IT'S AGE?SPECIFIC...
MM?HMM.
YOU KNOW, 3 TO WHAT?
14.
14, OKAY.
MM?HMM.
SO THAT'S??THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A NICHE PRODUCT.
OTHER THAN THE OTHER NICHE,
WHICH IS SEASONAL,
THIS IS A?A CHRISTMASTIME?TYPE
PRODUCT,
SO THE AGE
AND THE SEASONALITY OF IT
ARE TWO STRIKES AGAINST
THE BUSINESS FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
LISA, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY?
ORDER MORE INVENTORY
TO HANDLE
THE FOURTH QUARTER ORDERS
THAT I HAVE.
DO YOU HAVE THOSE ORDERS?
HARD COPY, FIRM?
YES, SITTING ON MY DESK
RIGHT NOW. YES.
LISA,
I WOULD BE
VERY COMFORTABLE INVESTING...
BUT ONLY $50,000,
WHICH CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY,
BUT ALSO A PROBLEM FOR YOU.
BUT I MUST HAVE
MY THIRD SHARE OF 50%.
I HAVE THE POWER TO DO THIS DEAL
AND MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH,
WHICH WOULD IN TURN,
MAKE ME RICHER.
SOUNDS GOOD. (chuckles)
I HAVE UNLIMITED
MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES,
SO IF YOU HAVE ORDERS
UP TO $10 BILLION,
I COULD SHIP THAT TOMORROW.
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
SO HERE'S WHAT I'M OFFERING??
I WILL OFFER YOU
ALL THE MANUFACTURING YOU WILL
EVER NEED AND DISTRIBUTION.
YOU'LL HANDLE SALES.
BUT I WOULD NEED 60%
OF THE COMPANY,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
NO MORE WORRIES AFTER THAT.
NOW, BARBARA, IF YOU FEEL
YOU WANT TO COME IN...
AM I BEING INVITED IN?
ARE YOU HAPPY TODAY, DAYMOND?
GEE, I'M SUSPICIOUS.
YES, BARBARA.
I'M GOING TO INVITE BARBARA
INTO MY SIDE OF THE DEAL.
(Robert) HANG ON, LISA.
I THINK THIS IS ALL CRAP.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE BEING
AS NICE TO YOU
AS THEY THINK THEY ARE.
FUNDAMENTALLY,
THEY'RE GIVING YOU 150 GRAND
FOR 60% OF YOUR BUSINESS.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
SO I THINK LISA NEEDS
TO DECIDE.
SO THIS IS
THE LOAN SHARK TANK?
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
WHY DON'T WE LET HER DECIDE,
DAYMOND?
I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF ALL I NEED IS MONEY,
THAT THIS WOULD BE
THE BEST WAY TO GO??
A LINE OF CREDIT??
IF I ONLY NEEDED MONEY.
UM, BUT IF I ONLY NEEDED
MONEY, I'D NEED A LOT MORE
THAN $150,000.
SO I THINK WHAT'S IN THE BEST
INTEREST OF THIS COMPANY
AND WHERE??WHAT IT NEEDS??
JUST PUT HIM
OUT OF HIS MISERY.
IT WOULD BE BEST TO WORK
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.
THANK YOU.
SO THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU RICH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
(Daymond) THE ROBIN HOOD CRAP
DOESN'T WORK WITH ME.
(whispers) YEAH!
OH!
THANK YOU.
I CAN'T HELP HER IN THE WAY
YOU CAN HELP HER.
WHAT IF YOU HAD MADE HER
SECOND?GUESS IT?
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST NEEDED HER TO BE SURE.
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?
DO YOU KNOW HER?
I DON'T KNOW HER,
BUT I'VE BEEN WHERE SHE'S BEEN.
I JUST HOPE YOU'RE LIKE THIS
FOR EVERYBODY,
BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME
I SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
I'M GONNA SAY, "ROB, STICK YOUR
NOSE IN IT AND JUST BE SO KIND."
OOH, I'M SO SCARED, DAYMOND.
OOH!
"I'M SO KIND."
I'M SO RELIEVED. THIS DEAL
IS GONNA CHANGE EVERYTHING.
IT'S BEEN SO MANY SLEEPLESS
NIGHTS AND WORKING SO HARD.
SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
HAS SEEN HOW MUCH I'VE PUT UP,
UM, PUT ON THE LINE FOR THIS,
AND IT ALL CAME TOGETHER TODAY.
