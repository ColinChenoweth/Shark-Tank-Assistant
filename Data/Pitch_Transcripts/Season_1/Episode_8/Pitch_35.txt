MY NAME'S SEAN CONWAY.
MY NAME IS D. J. STEPHAN.
I MET SEAN
ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA.
SO I'M GONNA??I'M GONNA
BUST OUT MY LAPTOP.
YOU GOT IT.
I'M GONNA START WORKING
RIGHT AWAY.
I LIKE IT.
(D.J.) WE BOTH HAD
A VERY ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT,
AND WE'VE BEEN, UH,
GREAT FRIENDS EVER SINCE.
WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE,
I ALWAYS STRUGGLED
DURING CLASS.
IT GOT TO THE POINT
WHERE I HAD TO GO SEE A DOCTOR,
AND THE DOCTOR DIAGNOSED ME
WITH A. D. H. D.
(Sean) I CREATED A SERVICE
WHERE STUDENTS CAN BUY AND SELL
CLASS NOTES AND STUDY GUIDES.
NOTEHALL IS A WIN?WIN
FOR BOTH STUDENTS,
BECAUSE STUDENTS WHO TAKE
GREAT NOTES CAN UPLOAD THEM
AND EARN SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME
FOR IT, AND STUDENTS THAT
HAPPEN TO FALL BEHIND
FOR ANY VARIETY OF REASONS
CAN NOW LOG ON TO NOTEHALL
AND GET CAUGHT UP INSTANTLY.
GIVEN THE COMPETITIVE NATURE
OF THE INTERNET,
WE HAVE TO MOVE FAST.
WE NEED THE EXPERTISE
AND FINANCIAL BACKING
OF THE SHARKS
TO TAKE THIS WORLDWIDE
AND LITERALLY HELP
ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS.
HELLO.
MY NAME IS D. J. STEPHAN.
THIS IS SEAN CONWAY.
OUR COMPANY IS NOTEHALL.
AND WE'RE HERE
ASKING FOR $90,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
NOTEHALL'S A WEB SITE
THAT ALLOWS COLLEGE STUDENTS
TO BUY AND SELL CLASS NOTES
AND STUDY GUIDES
IN EACH
OF THEIR COLLEGE COURSES.
SO, KEVIN, LET'S SAY YOU HAVE
A HUGE EXAM COMING UP.
SO YOU'RE NATURALLY
GONNA CREATE A STUDY GUIDE
TO PREPARE FOR THAT EXAM.
YOU'RE GONNA LOAD IT
ON NOTEHALL.
AT THE SAME TIME, ROBERT,
YOU HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED
BY THE CUTE BLONDE GIRL
IN CLASS.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 20 YEARS.
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.
(O'Leary) BUT HE HAS BEEN
STEALING MY NOTES FOR YEARS.
(laughs)
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GO ON
AND DOWNLOAD KEVIN'S NOTES
AND PAY A FEW DOLLARS
DOING THIS,
AND THEN KEVIN'S
GONNA EARN A COMMISSION
ON??ON HIS TRANSACTION.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
WE LAUNCHED IT
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,
AND WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS,
OUR WEB SITE WAS BEING USED
BY OVER 40% OF THE STUDENTS
ON CAMPUS.
WOW.
WE PILOT LAUNCHED
AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY
AND KANSAS UNIVERSITY, AND WE
SAW RELATIVELY GREAT TRAFFIC
WITH BASICALLY
ZERO ADVERTISING COSTS.
WE'RE PLANNING ON LAUNCHING
AT 24 UNIVERSITIES
THIS UPCOMING FALL,
AND WITH YOUR HELP,
WE FEEL WE CAN GO NATIONWIDE
IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,
MAKING NOTEHALL THE NEXT DORM
ROOM NAME ON THE WEB TODAY.
IS IT LEGAL?
(D.J.) YES, IT IS.
ABSOLUTELY. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS
PRETTY MUCH GIVING THE STUDENTS
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF THE ACTUAL COURSE,
AND WE'RE TEACHING THOSE
STUDENTS HOW TO TAKE NOTES.
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE NOTES ARE GOOD?
DO YOU GET??KIND OF GET A CHANCE
TO TAKE A LITTLE PEEK...
(D. J.) OF COURSE.
AND REVIEW IT
BEFORE YOU SIGN UP?
RIGHT, SO THERE'S
ACTUALLY A PREVIEW
THAT'S AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED,
AND IT SHOWS 30% OF THE NOTES.
WHAT IF IT'S
THE WRONG INFORMATION?
WE OFFER 100% MONEY?BACK
GUARANTEE
IF STUDENTS AREN'T SATISFIED
WITH THE CONTENT THEY BUY.
OH, THAT'S BETTER.
AND WE'VE ONLY REFUNDED ABOUT 25
OUT OF OVER 5,700 DOCUMENTS
THAT HAVE BEEN UPLOADED??
BUT QUICK QUESTION??
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU GUYS SOLD
IN ONE YEAR.
UH, SO WE HAD 5,900 CREDIT CARD
TRANSACTIONS IN 8 MONTHS,
AND WE HAD $30,000 IN REVENUE.
WHAT'S THE PRICE
OF A TYPICAL NOTE DOWNLOAD?
SO THE ACTUAL
TRANSACTION PRICE??
OUR AVERAGE TRANSACTION
PRICE??IS AROUND $4.90.
DO YOU GET A CUT
OFF THE FEE I'M PAYING?
SO ON AVERAGE,
NOTEHALL WILL WITHHOLD
60% OF THE ACTUAL TRANSACTION
AND THEN NOTE TAKERS
WILL EARN 40%.
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA,
AND LIKE OTHER GREAT IDEAS
ON THE INTERNET,
THEY GET COPIED RIGHT AWAY.
(D. J.) RIGHT.
TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR COMPETITION.
WE DO HAVE SOME OTHER PLAYERS
IN THE SPACE,
AND NO ONE
HAS GAINED TRACTION YET.
THAT??WHEN I SAY WE SAW
RELATIVELY GREAT TRAFFIC
AT K. U. AND A. S. U.,
IT'S BECAUSE WE GAINED 1,500
NEW USERS IN 6 WEEKS TIME.
SOME OF THE LEADING COMPETITORS
IN THE SPACE HAVE BEEN THERE
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF??
1,300 STUDENTS.
WHY THE DIFFERENCE? WHY WEREN'T
THEY ABLE TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE?
WE'VE DISCOVERED A WAY
TO GET CONTENT CREATORS
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY,
AND THAT'S THE LIFEBLOOD.
OUR COMPETITORS
ARE JUST FOCUSED
ON TRYING TO GET
AS MANY USERS AS THEY CAN,
AND NO ONE'S UPLOADING
ANY VALUABLE CONTENT.
AND IF THEY DON'T GET
THE VALUABLE CONTENT,
STUDENTS ARE NOT GONNA CONTINUE,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GROW VIRALLY
LIKE WE'VE SEEN SO FAR
AT K. U. AND A. S. U.
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA USE THE MONEY FOR?
IT'S ALL
FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION.
YOU'RE GONNA EXPAND THIS
INTO OTHER COLLEGES.
EX?EXACTLY.
AND HOW MANY CUSTOMERS
CAN YOU GET FOR THAT MONEY
IF YOU SPENT IT ENTIRELY
ON ACQUISITION?
WE CAN GET AT LEAST
85,000 USERS FROM THAT.
SEAN, YOU CAME HERE ASKING
FOR $90,000...
THAT'S RIGHT.
FOR 10% OF THE BUSINESS,
AND YOU THINK THAT THE COMPANY
IS WORTH $900,000.
WHY IS IT WORTH $900,000?
(Harrington) GUYS, I'M??
I'M GONNA MAKE IT EASY.
IT'S TOO MUCH OF A START?UP
FOR ME, SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
WHY IS IT WORTH $900,000?
YOU HAVE 30 GRAND IN SALES.
AT K. U. AND A. S. U., WE GOT
1,500 USERS IN 6 WEEKS.
OF WHICH YOU'RE NOT PROFITABLE
ON THAT.
(Robert) THIS IS
YOUR PIVOTAL MOMENT.
YOUR ANSWER TO KEVIN'S QUESTION
WILL DETERMINE, FOR ME,
WHETHER I HAVE AN INTEREST
OR NOT.
IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MAKE
YOU $24 MILLION IN REVENUE
IN FOUR YEARS.
WHAT?
I'LL BET HALF MY COMPANY
ON IT.
HOW MUCH?
HALF.
(O'Leary) WHOA.
WOW.
WOW. WHAT CONFIDENCE.
I'M THAT CONFIDENT IN NOTEHALL.
I?I KNOW IT'S GONNA SUCCEED.
WOW, WHAT BLIND CONFIDENCE.
I LOVE THAT.
NOT BLIND.
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GIVE YOU $90,000
FOR 51% OF YOUR COMPANY
AND STAY OUT OF YOUR WAY.
YOU RUN AROUND,
YOU SIGN UP EVERY SINGLE COLLEGE
BASE OF STUDENTS YOU CAN,
YOU DELIVER ME
THAT $20 MILLION,
AND I'LL TAKE YOU PUBLIC.
OR I'LL SELL YOU TO A STRATEGIC
AND MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH.
OR YOU COULD KEEP
THAT 1% FOR YOURSELF,
AND I'LL TAKE 50%
OF THE BUSINESS FOR $90,000.
BARBARA, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO WITH THIS?
WHAT??YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO BUSINESS HERE.
I HAVE EVERY BUSINESS
BEING HERE. YOU KNOW WHY?
THE SINGLE BEST BUSINESS DEAL
I'VE EVER MADE
WAS WHEN I USED TO TRADE
MY ENGLISH DIAGRAMS IN ENGLISH
CLASS FOR MATH HOMEWORK.
(all laugh)
AND I DID IT FOR SIX MONTHS,
AND I GOT GOOD GRADES
UNTIL I GOT CAUGHT.
ABSOLUTELY DON'T NEED YOU
NEAR THESE GUYS.
IT WORKS. THAT WAS ILLEGAL.
THIS IS LEGAL.
YOU'RE GONNA CORRUPT
THESE YOUNG MINDS, BARBARA.
NOT AT ALL.
RIGHT NOW IT'S 51%
FOR $90,000
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S DONE IT
TO THE TUNE OF $3.2 BILLION.
LET THAT ROLL OFF YOUR LIPS??
BILLION, BILLION??
AS YOU??
SEAN, BEFORE I HEAR
THAT "BILLION AND BILLION
AND BILLION," KEEP IN MIND,
THERE'S ONE VERY, VERY
IMPORTANT THING. DON'T EVER...
DO YOU HAVE AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE, ROBERT...
DON'T EVER BE...
OR IS IT JUST NOISE?
DON'T EVER BE ENAMORED
BY WHAT SOMETHING SELLS FOR.
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT WHAT YOU GET
TO KEEP IN YOUR POCKET.
(D.J.) OF COURSE.
I DIDN'T SELL MY COMPANY
FOR <i>BILLIONS</i> OF DOLLARS,
BUT I HAD 100% OF THE EQUITY
WHEN I DID SELL MY BUSINESS.
IT'S ABOUT WHAT GOES
INTO YOUR POCKET.
ARE YOU JUST TRYING
TO BOTCH HIS DEAL?
(O'Leary) IT'S JUST??
IT'S JUST NOISE.
IS THIS YOUR FIRST VENTURE,
THE TWO OF YOU?
YEAH.
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, POO?POO HAPPENS.
STUFF YOU HAD NO IDEA
WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU
IS GOING TO HAPPEN,
BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU,
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO ENDURE ALL THAT.
AND I KNOW THAT'S GONNA OCCUR.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE MONEY.
I KNOW ALL THAT ALREADY.
SO WE'RE GIVING 50% NOW,
BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING
WE NEED MORE MONEY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE
ANOTHER 20%, 30% THEN.
WE'RE NOT WILLING TO MAKE
THAT SACRIFICE.
WHAT??OKAY, BUT LOOK,
10%'s LUDICROUS FOR 90 GRAND.
WHAT'S YOUR COUNTER?
SO WE WANT TO GIVE 15??
15% OF THE COMPANY AWAY.
15.
15. 15. 1?5 NOT 5?0.
1?5% FOR THE $90,000?
FOR $90,000.
AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE
AN INSURANCE POLICY
ON TOP OF THAT.
WHAT'S THE INSURANCE POLICY?
24 MONTHS FROM TODAY, IF WE
DON'T HIT $1 MILLION IN REVENUE,
SEAN AND I WILL GIVE YOU
OUR PORTION OF THE COMPANY.
NOW I LOOK AT YOU AS GUYS
THAT ARE JUST LIKE ME WITH HAIR,
20 YEARS AGO.
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A TASTE
OF YOUR FLESH, NOT ALL OF IT,
'CAUSE I WANT YOU
TO STAY MOTIVATED.
I WOULD DO THE DEAL
FOR 35% FOR $90,000.
(mouths words)
THIS GUY WILL EAT YOU FOR
BREAKFAST AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.
IF YOU'VE GONNA
BE EATEN FOR??
EVERY LITTLE NICHE AND A TURN,
HE'LL BE GRABBING
SOME MORE STOCK.
AND BELIEVE ME,
HE'S AN ANIMAL.
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND YOU
GUYS HAVE A HOME RUN HIT HERE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU 25%
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY??
$90,000. I THINK YOU
SHOULD TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.
DEFINITELY WILL. THANK YOU.
AND I DON'T WANT
YOUR GUARANTEE.
SO, SEAN, I THINK
THAT YOU AGREE WITH ME
THAT THERE IS VALUE
IN HAVING EXPERIENCE.
THE KEY
TO INTERNET BUSINESSES??
YOU GOTTA KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING. THIS IS ALL I DO.
I START FROM ZERO AND RAMP UP
TO $50 MILLION LIKE THIS.
(snaps fingers)
THIS IS YOUR ONLY PLAY.
I'D LIKE TO OFFER YOU
$115,000
FOR $35%.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DO THE SAME DEAL HE DID.
IT'S TIME
TO MAKE A DECISION.
(Sean) OKAY.
BARBARA'S DEAL?
LET'S MAKE MILLIONS.
LET'S DO THIS.
(D. J.) YEAH.
(Barbara) I LOVE THESE GUYS.
(Daymond) ALL RIGHT.
YOU MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.
OH, GOSH!
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(O'Leary) YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
(laughs)
BARBARA BEAT YOU
WITH YOUR OWN TRICK.
I FORGOT THEIR NAMES. I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
AND IT FELT SO GOOD
TO BEAT HIM.
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.
YOU WORE HIM OUT.
BARBARA, YOU HAVE INFECTED
THAT COMPANY WITH YOUR MADNESS.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.
YOU'VE TAINTED THAT DEAL.
I?I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR YOU.
I'M SO HAPPY.
I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF
ANYTHING BUT THE FUTURE.
THE??THE WHOLE THING IS??
IT'S GONE INTO SOME OTHER PLACE
BECAUSE OF YOU.
IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BEAT
THIS GUY. I DON'T KNOW WHY.
YOU'RE OKAY, ROBERT. I DON'T
GET JOY IN BEATING YOU.
YOU KNOW??
BUT BEATING YOU?
OH! I LOVE IT.
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST WORTH
THE MONEY, RIGHT?
(O'Leary)
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I GOT IT.
WHAT'S HE DOING?
YES.
YES. THAT WAS AWESOME.
IT WAS AWESOME.
(D.J.) IT WAS FUNNY. YEAH.
BARBARA??SHE??SHE HAD CONFIDENCE
IN US FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
RIGHT. RIGHT. THAT'S??
YOU KNOW, SHE WASN'T TRYING
TO HIGH??LOWBALL US WITH 50%??
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON, GUYS.
HO??OH.
LISTEN, WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE
WAS INSANE.
YOU JUST MADE A DEAL
WITH A REAL ESTATE AGENT.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU? SHE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE DID.
I'M GONNA SEND HER OFF
FOR THERAPY OR SOMETHING,
BECAUSE THAT WAS INSANE.
IF YOU WERE IN OUR SHOES,
YOU WOULD'VE REALLY TAKEN
35% FOR $90,000?
AND LOOK,
I'M NOT SAYING I BLAME YOU,
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHO THE SHARK IS HERE.
I THINK IT'S YOU.
(laughs)
I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
YEAH, I THINK SO.
ANYWAYS, I JUST WANTED
TO CONGRATULATE YOU GUYS.
YEAH, THANK YOU.
I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC
BUSINESS. GOOD LUCK WITH YOU.
THANK YOU, KEVIN.
BUT I JUST??IT??IT'S??
THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME,
SO IT DIDN'T SIT WELL WITH ME.
THAT'S WHY I CAME IN HERE.
ANYWAYS, GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
THANKS.
WE PICKED BARBARA,
BECAUSE SHE WAS AUTHENTIC
WITH US FROM THE BEGINNING.
KEVIN WAS TRYING
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US,
AND WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
WITH OUR DECISION.
ALL RIGHT, BARBARA.
YOU'RE IN. (laughs)
(Robert) ALL RIGHT.
I THINK YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
(Daymond) YOU MADE
A BIG MISTAKE...
(Barbara) YOU DID NOT.
HORRIBLE MISTAKE.
(Allison)
I DON'T THINK WE DID.
LADIES, IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.
HERE WE ARE AT THE LARGEST
BABY PRODUCTS SHOW
IN THE UNITED STATES.
THIS IS
THE MOST AMAZING PRODUCT.
IT'S ACTUALLY A SLIPCOVER
FOR PORTABLE PLAY YARDS.
SINCE MAKING THE DEAL
WITH BARBARA,
WE'VE HAD SO MANY DOORS OPEN.
...SO GROSS INSIDE NOW.
(Allison)
MAJOR ONLINE RETAILERS
COMPLETELY SOLD OUT
OF THE PRODUCT.
WE HAVE MORE ORDERS THAN
WE COULD EVER POSSIBLY IMAGINE.
OKAY, SO I WANT TO DO
PROBABLY 36 UNITS
OF EACH OF THE PATTERNS
FOR EACH STORE.
WE CONTACTED ONE OF THE LARGEST
HOTEL CHAINS IN THE NATION,
AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS
OF CLOSING A DEAL
THAT WOULD PUT COVERPLAY IN
EVERY ONE OF THEIR PROPERTIES.
WE'VE BEEN, LIKE,
BOMBARDED THE WHOLE DAY.
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK INTO A BANK
AND GET A LOAN FOR $350,000,
SO CLOSING THE DEAL
WITH BARBARA
WAS THE BEST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED FOR OUR COMPANY.
