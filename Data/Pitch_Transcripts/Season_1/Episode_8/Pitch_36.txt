HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
I'M EDWIN HEAVEN.
I'M THE CREATOR OF THROX,
THE CURE FOR THE MISSING SOCK.
THROX LIKES TO DO THINGS
IN THREES,
EDWIN, I WONDER,
IS THIS A REAL PRODUCT
OR IS THIS A CUTE GIFT ITEM
THAT MY WIFE IS GONNA BUY
ONE TIME FOR OUR KIDS?
NO, I BELIEVE
THAT THROX HAS LEGS.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY?
MY SALES TODAY ARE $38,000.
FOR THE YEAR?
FOR??FOR THE YEAR. I'VE SOLD
8,500 UNITS THIS YEAR.
I PREDICT 80,000 UNITS
IN 2010.
LISTEN, EDWIN, IF YOU ACTUALLY
STARTED TO TAKE ANY MARKET SHARE
FROM THE ESTABLISHED
SOCK MAKERS,
THEY COULD CRUSH YOU LIKE
THE VAMPIRE COCKROACH YOU ARE
IN TWO SECONDS.
YOU HAVE NO SALES.
YOU HAVE??
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE .001% SHARE
OF THIS MARKET.
EDWIN, I'D LOVE TO BUY ONE
OR TWO FOR CHRISTMAS
THANK YOU, EDWIN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THE FACT THAT THE SHARKS
SAW IT AS A NOVELTY
IS A BIT DISAPPOINTING.
THAT'S GOT A HUGE BACKGROUND
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
