MY NAME IS DANON BERES.
MY COMPANY IS
WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD.
HEY, GUYS.
(Danon) HEY?O.
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?
MY DAD IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL
BELT DESIGNER.
HE'S BEEN IN THE BUSINESS
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
HI, MY NAME IS DANON BERES.
SO WHAT ARE YOUR SALES,
DANON, OVERALL?
IN 2008, THEY WERE $435,000.
DID YOU MAKE ANY MONEY
ON $438,000?
WE'RE $50,000 NET PROFIT.
WHAT'S THE PRICE POINT??
THE BELT
YOU'RE WEARING RIGHT NOW?
THE RETAIL PRICE POINT'S
FROM $55 TO $99.
THIS IS A $99 BELT.
SO THE PRICES ARE GOOD
FOR THE QUALITY.
YOU SELL THAT BELT FOR $100,
YOU HAVE ON?
YES.
DANON, DIDN'T SAY YOUR FAMILY
WAS INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS?
YOU'RE CORRECT.
I ACTUALLY COME FROM A FAMILY
THAT'S GOT A HUGE BACKGROUND
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
MY FATHER, AL BERES,
DESIGNED BELTS FOR 35 YEARS.
(Robert) LOOK, DANON,
HERE'S THE REALITY??
I THINK THE BUSINESS IS PROBABLY
WORTH $600,000 TO $700,000.
IF YOU WANTED 25%,
I'D GIVE YOU $100,000, $200,000.
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU $500,000,
'CAUSE I'D HAVE TO OWN YOU
BECAUSE HE WAS GREEDY
SETTING THE PRICE.
(Danon) DAYMOND, YOU'VE BEEN
IN THE FASHION BUSINESS.
YOU'VE SEEN HOW QUICKLY IT CAN
GO FROM ZERO TO A CRAZY NUMBER.
SO I DON'T SEE
WHY THIS COULDN'T??
BECAUSE WE'RE VALUING YOU
ON TODAY
(Robert) DANON, WHAT YOU'RE
ASKING FOR IS GAMBLING.
IT'S AN EARLY?STAGE THING.
DANON, DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
ON A PRIVATE?LABEL DEAL,
DANON, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
$500,000 FOR ANYTHING...
THAT ISN'T
MORE THAN YOU OWN TODAY.
I??IT'S CRAZY.
BIG MISTAKE
WITH THE VALUATION.
I'M OUT.
