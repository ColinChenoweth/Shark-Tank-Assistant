HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
I'M EDWIN HEAVEN.
I'M THE CREATOR OF THROX,
THE CURE FOR THE MISSING SOCK.
THROX LIKES TO DO THINGS
IN THREES,
AND WE AIM TO PLEASE
IN THREES.
AND I'M ASKING FOR $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY.
LET ME ASK YOU, WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU LOSE A SOCK?
DO YOU SCREAM BLOODY MURDER?
DO YOU KICK THE WASHER/DRYER?
WELL, I HAVE A SOLUTION??
THROX??THREE SOCKS.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
SO WHEN YOU LOSE ONE,
YOU STILL HAVE A PAIR??
THE CURE FOR THE MISSING SOCK.
THROX BEATS THE COMPETITION
BY A FOOT.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
EDWIN, I WONDER,
IS THIS A REAL PRODUCT
OR IS THIS A CUTE GIFT ITEM
THAT MY WIFE IS GONNA BUY
ONE TIME FOR OUR KIDS?
NO, I BELIEVE
THAT THROX HAS LEGS.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY?
MY SALES TODAY ARE $38,000.
FOR THE YEAR?
FOR??FOR THE YEAR. I'VE SOLD
8,500 UNITS THIS YEAR.
I PREDICT 80,000 UNITS
IN 2010.
LISTEN, EDWIN, IF YOU ACTUALLY
STARTED TO TAKE ANY MARKET SHARE
FROM THE ESTABLISHED
SOCK MAKERS,
THEY COULD CRUSH YOU LIKE
THE VAMPIRE COCKROACH YOU ARE
IN TWO SECONDS.
YOU HAVE NO SALES.
YOU HAVE??
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE .001% SHARE
OF THIS MARKET.
I ENTERED THE MARKET,
AND I HAD TO DO IT ALL MYSELF.
OKAY, IF IT WORKS, AND YOUR
SALES GET TO $10 MILLION,
AND I'M A LARGE SOCK GUY,
AND I SAY, "YOU KNOW,
HEY, THERE'S THREE SOCKS HERE.
THEY'RE SELLING A LOT."
(snaps fingers)
"GET MY SECRETARY IN HERE.
"GET THE HEAD OF PRODUCTION
AND MARKETING.
YOU SEE THIS? IT'S TAKING SHARE
FROM US. CRUSH THIS COCKROACH."
HAVE YOU PATENTED THIS?
YOU CANNOT PATENT
A PACKAGE OF THREE SOCKS.
RIGHT.
I AM OUT.
I SEE IT AS A NOVELTY PRODUCT.
I CAN'T SEE YOU EVER MAKING
MONEY WITH THIS, SO I'M OUT.
EDWIN, I'D LOVE TO BUY ONE
OR TWO FOR CHRISTMAS
AND GET A SMILE
ON SOMEONE'S FACE,
BUT I DON'T SEE IT AS A REPEAT
SALE, SO SADLY, I'M OUT.
YOU KEEP DOING IT,
BUT THIS IS FAR, FAR TOO SMALL
FOR ME, AS AN INVESTOR,
TO MAKE ANY MONEY.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA AGREE WITH ROBERT
THAT YOU SHOULD DO THIS
BY YOURSELF FOR A WHILE.
AS AN INVESTOR,
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, EDWIN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THE FACT THAT THE SHARKS
SAW IT AS A NOVELTY
IS A BIT DISAPPOINTING.
THAT'S GOT A HUGE BACKGROUND
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
AND A BUS RUNS YOU OVER,
YOU'RE GONNA BE SPARKLING
ON THE PAVEMENT.
I LOOK BOTH WAYS, ALWAYS.
THE GUY IS THE REAL DEAL.
HE'S GOT ORDERS. HE'S GOT??
HE'S THE REAL DEAL
AND HE'S A PIG.
