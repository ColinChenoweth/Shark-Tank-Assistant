MY NAME IS DANON BERES.
MY COMPANY IS
WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD.
WE MANUFACTURE DESIGNER BUCKLES
AND BELTS FOR MEN AND WOMEN.
HEY, GUYS.
(Danon) HEY?O.
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?
MY DAD IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL
BELT DESIGNER.
HE'S BEEN IN THE BUSINESS
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
HE'S DESIGNED FOR VERY HIGH?END
BOUTIQUES AND CELEBRITIES.
I GREW UP WATCHING MY DAD
DESIGN BELTS.
I WANTED TO DO THE SAME THING
HE DID,
AND I DECIDED TO CREATE
MY OWN BELT COMPANY.
WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD
IS ALREADY SUCCESSFUL.
WE'VE SOLD TO MAJOR DEPARTMENT
STORES AND TO CELEBRITIES
AROUND THE WORLD.
I LOVE THIS. I JUST
ABSOLUTELY THING THIS IS...
THIS IS COOL.
THIS IS GONNA BE IN
A LITTLE BIT LATER
IN THE SEASON.
WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD
IS A FAMILY BUSINESS.
MY BROTHER AND SISTER
WORK WITH ME.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US
THAT WE MAKE OUR FATHER PROUD.
I KNOW MY PRODUCT'S AWESOME.
I KNOW WITH
THE RIGHT INVESTMENT,
MY COMPANY CAN GROW
MUCH, MUCH BIGGER.
YOU GUYS DID
A REALLY, REALLY GREAT JOB.
I HAVE HUGE ASPIRATIONS
TO MAKE WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD
A HUGE BUSINESS.
IF THE SHARKS INVEST,
I CAN GUARANTEE
THEIR PANTS
WILL NEVER FALL DOWN.
HI, MY NAME IS DANON BERES.
I'M C. E. O. OF THE INNOVATIVE
FASHION ACCESSORY BRAND
WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD.
WE'RE SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $500,000.
THIS IS IN EXCHANGE FOR 25%
OF OUR EMERGING COMPANY.
NOW OUR COMPANY
IS MOST NOTABLY KNOWN
FOR OUR UNIQUE HARDWARE BUCKLES
AND BELTS.
LADIES.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S COOL.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
OUR BELTS ARE HOT.
THEY'RE DESIGNED FOR THE ELITE,
FOR THE CELEBRITY IN MIND.
BUT THEY'RE AFFORDABLY PRICED
FOR EVERYONE.
OUR TARGET MARKET'S
THE 18? TO 40?YEAR?OLD MALES
AND FEMALES.
OUR BELTS HAVE APPEARED
IN MAGAZINES WORLDWIDE.
I PERSONALLY COME FROM
A STRONG FAMILY BACKGROUND
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
IN BARELY THREE YEARS TIME,
WITH MY OWN
SMALL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS,
WE'VE STEADILY GROWN
AND BECOME PROFITABLE.
OUR BELTS HAVE SOLD IN OVER
300 STORES AND IN 12 COUNTRIES.
THIS INCLUDES ONE OF
THE TOP UPSCALE DEPARTMENT STORE
CHAINS IN THE U. S.,
AS WELL AS A MAJOR CHAIN
IN CANADA.
YOU SORT OF DROPPED SOME NAMES,
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR THEM.
OUT WITH THEM.
WE'RE IN PARASUCO JEANS
IN CANADA.
(O'Leary) OKAY.
WE'RE IN NORDSTROM RIGHT NOW.
SO WHAT ARE YOUR SALES,
DANON, OVERALL?
IN 2008, THEY WERE $435,000.
DID YOU MAKE ANY MONEY
ON $438,000?
WE'RE $50,000 NET PROFIT.
WHAT'S THE PRICE POINT??
THE BELT
YOU'RE WEARING RIGHT NOW?
THE RETAIL PRICE POINT'S
FROM $55 TO $99.
THIS IS A $99 BELT.
SO THE PRICES ARE GOOD
FOR THE QUALITY.
YOU SELL THAT BELT FOR $100,
YOU HAVE ON?
YES.
AND WHAT DID YOU PAY
TO MAKE THAT?
THIS BELT?
IT COST $40 WHOLESALE.
HOW MANY BELTS HAVE YOU SOLD
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
UH, IT'S ABOUT 10??
A LITTLE OVER 10,000.
YOU SOLD 10,000 BELTS
IN THE LAST YEAR?
YES.
DANON, DIDN'T SAY YOUR FAMILY
WAS INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS?
YOU'RE CORRECT.
I ACTUALLY COME FROM A FAMILY
THAT'S GOT A HUGE BACKGROUND
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
MY FATHER, AL BERES,
DESIGNED BELTS FOR 35 YEARS.
HE SOLD TO THE HIGH?END STORES
AND CELEBRITIES??
EXPENSIVE, $1,000 BELTS.
SO BASICALLY, WHAT I DID WHEN
LAUNCHING WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD,
I WORKED UNDER HIS WING
FOR 15 YEARS,
GOING TO THE TRADE SHOWS,
LEARNING THE BUSINESS.
I WANTED TO MAKE A PRODUCT
THAT WAS AT A LOWER PRICE POINT
THAT COULD BE SOLD
TO THE MASSES, BASICALLY.
WHO'S YOUR COMPETITION
RIGHT NOW?
WE DON'T HAVE
A VERY STRONG COMPETITION
FOR DIRECTLY WHAT WE DO.
NO ONE'S AT OUR PRICE POINT.
NONE OF THEM REALLY HAVE
THE TYPE OF BUCKLE??
THE TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT WE
MAKE, A STAGE?PRESENCE PRODUCT.
WHY??WHY ARE YOU BETTER THEN?
YOU GUYS SEE THE BELTS?
I MEAN, WHAT??WHAT DO YOU SEE
ABOUT ALL THE BELTS
THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT?
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT CATCHES YOUR EYES?
THE DESIGN.
(Barbara) THE BUCKLE.
(O'Leary) WHO'S YOUR DESIGNER?
I'M THE DESIGNER.
YOU'RE THE DESIGNER,
AND YOU'RE THE C. E. O.?
(O'Leary) THAT'S PRETTY RARE.
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE
INVESTED INTO THIS COMPANY?
I HAVE OVER 120,000
OF MY OWN DOLLARS INVESTED IN.
YOU'RE SAYING YOUR COMPANY
IS WORTH $2 MILLION,
BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $500,000...
CORRECT.
FOR 25%.
WE HAVE OVER $150,000
IN ASSETS.
OUR SALES
HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY.
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I LIKE THE REVENUE STREAM.
I THINK HE'S GROWING.
THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS,
I DON'T LIKE THE VALUE.
IT'S A $2?MILLION VALUATION.
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
YOU'VE CREATED
THAT'S GONE
FROM ZERO TO $400,000.
BUT THERE'S NO CHANCE
IT'S WORTH 2 MILLION BUCKS.
I GIVE YOU THE $500,000,
HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
I THINK WE CAN BUILD OUR COMPANY
INTO A $32?MILLION COMPANY
IN FIVE YEARS.
I LOVE THE ARROGANCE.
I LOVE THE CONFIDENCE.
APPAREL COMPANIES
ARE EXPLOSIVE.
I HATE YOUR VALUATION.
THE GUY IS THE REAL DEAL.
HE'S GOT ORDERS. HE'S GOT??
HE'S THE REAL DEAL
AND HE'S A PIG.
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH A GUY LIKE THIS?
I THINK
HE'S JUST PLAYING WITH US.
ANY SECOND NOW,
HE'S GONNA SAY...
"JUST KIDDING. JUST KIDDING."
"I WAS JUST JOKING A??"
"I'M REALLY WORTH..."
AND GIVE US
THE REAL VALUATION.
"$650,000.
LET'S WORK TOGETHER."
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?
YOU THINK
WE'RE WORTH $650,000?
YEAH.
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
OUR SALES ARE ALREADY??
YOU'RE WORTH??
OUR SALES ARE APPROACHING??
YOU'RE WORTH ONE AND A HALF
TIMES SALES RIGHT NOW.
LOOK, YOU'RE
A VERY INTERESTING CHARACTER??
A C. E. O./DESIGNER.
NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A RISK THERE.
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
AND A BUS RUNS YOU OVER,
YOU'RE GONNA BE SPARKLING
ON THE PAVEMENT WITH THAT BELT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I LOOK BOTH WAYS, ALWAYS.
(Robert) LOOK, DANON,
HERE'S THE REALITY??
I THINK THE BUSINESS IS PROBABLY
WORTH $600,000 TO $700,000.
IF YOU WANTED 25%,
I'D GIVE YOU $100,000, $200,000.
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU $500,000,
'CAUSE I'D HAVE TO OWN YOU
AND EVERY BELT BUCKLE
THAT YOU'VE EVER MADE.
AND ALL THE ONES YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.
HOW FRUSTRATING YOU ARE.
YOU'VE GOT A REAL BUSINESS,
BUT YOU'RE A PIG.
YOU'RE GREEDY.
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ANYTHING
FOR ME TO WET MY BEAK WITH
AT ALL.
WHAT DOES
THE CLOTHING GUY SAY?
IS THIS A REAL BUSINESS
OR NOT?
THAT PRICE IS OUTRAGEOUS.
I DO LIKE THE PRODUCT,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING DIFFERENT
FROM THE PRODUCT.
I CAN'T TELL THAT'S HIS BRAND
WHEN IT'S SPARKLING
AND WALKING BY ON SOMEBODY.
AS WELL AS, THESE ARE BUCKLES.
BUCKLES ARE HIDDEN UNDER
YOUR SHIRT MOST OF THE TIME.
AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT
HE'S SOLD THAT MANY UNITS
AND DID A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
IN THIS KIND OF MARKET.
NO, I CAN BACK THAT UP.
OF COURSE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I CALLED HIM A PIG,
AND YOU CALLED HIM A LIAR,
SO HE'S A LYING PIG.
YES, BUT A TALENTED
LYING PIG.
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS GUY?
BECAUSE HE WAS GREEDY
SETTING THE PRICE.
(Danon) DAYMOND, YOU'VE BEEN
IN THE FASHION BUSINESS.
YOU'VE SEEN HOW QUICKLY IT CAN
GO FROM ZERO TO A CRAZY NUMBER.
SO I DON'T SEE
WHY THIS COULDN'T??
BECAUSE WE'RE VALUING YOU
ON TODAY
AND NOT THE CRAZY NUMBER.
THAT'S ONLY??
(Robert) DANON, WHAT YOU'RE
ASKING FOR IS GAMBLING.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
INVESTING AND GAMBLING.
GAMBLING IS,
YOU THROW YOUR MONEY DOWN,
AND MAYBE IT RIDES,
MAYBE YOU LOSE IT.
INVESTING IS, YOU TAKE
THE VALUE OF THE BUSINESS TODAY,
ADD SOME MULTIPLE
FOR THE FUTURE
AND MAKE A DECISION.
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE SOME UPSIDE?
WE'RE TAKING ALL THE RISK.
WELL, YOU HAVE NO UPSIDE
AT $500,000.
THAT'S MY POINT.
THAT'S MY POINT.
YOU'RE NOT GIVING US
ANY UPSIDE.
YOU'RE JUST TAKING OUR MONEY
AND SCREWING US.
WE'RE PAYING AS IF YOU WERE
DOING $2 MILLION IN SALES,
AND YOU'RE DOING $400,000.
IT'S CRAZY.
BUT THE??
LOOK, THERE'S??
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO HERE
BECAUSE THERE'S NO CHANCE
I'M GIVING YOU $500,000.
I'D NEED 112%.
WE NEED $500,000, THOUGH,
TO TAKE US TO THE LEVEL
WE WANT TO BE AT.
AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR COMPANY
IS WORTH $2 MILLION.
ONE OF THE TOP DENIM BRANDS
IN THE WORLD
JUST STARTED WORKING WITH US
ON PRODUCING
SOME PRIVATE?LABEL PRODUCTS.
WE'RE IN THE INITIAL PHASES
OF DESIGNING.
IT WOULD INCREASE
OUR BUSINESS FIVEFOLD.
IT'S AN EARLY?STAGE THING.
DANON, DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
ON A PRIVATE?LABEL DEAL,
IT DOESN'T EXTEND YOUR BRAND,
WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD, AT ALL?
THAT BUSINESS, TO ME, IS WORTH
LESS THAN BUILDING THIS BRAND,
WASHED UP HOLLYWOOD, UP.
DANON, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
$500,000 FOR ANYTHING...
THAT ISN'T
MORE THAN YOU OWN TODAY.
I??IT'S CRAZY.
BIG MISTAKE
WITH THE VALUATION.
I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND.
THE NUMBERS DON'T WORK FOR ME,
AND??AND THE RISK DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME, REALLY.
I'M??I'M GONNA SAY,
I'M OUT.
IF YOU HAD COME IN HERE
WITH THAT RIGHT NUMBER,
YOU WOULD HAVE WITH YOU,
RIGHT NOW, THE RIGHT INVESTORS.
IT'S REALLY A SHAME.
SO I'M SO SAD TO SAY,
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOTTA SAY...
YOU'VE WASTED
YOUR OWN TIME TODAY,
PUTTING A CRAZY NUMBER ON IT.
THAT'S BECOME
VERY CLEAR TO YOU.
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT NOW.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
BUT WORSE?
YOU'VE WASTED MY TIME.
I'M OUT.
YOU REMIND ME OF ME
WHEN I STARTED.
YOU ARE CONFIDENT.
YOU'RE??YOU'RE RUNNING
THE COMPANY.
YOU'RE DESIGNING IT YOURSELF.
BUT YOU'RE ASKING FOR JUST,
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T DO,
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAD.
YOU WORKED SO HARD TO GET HERE,
AND YOU WORKED SO HARD
TO DESTROY YOUR OPPORTUNITY,
JUST BY THAT NUMBER.
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER,
I HAVE TO BE OUT.
OKAY.
YEAH, WE'RE ALL OUT.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE DONE.
THANK YOU.
(Harrington) THAT'S IT.
