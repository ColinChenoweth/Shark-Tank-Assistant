MY NAME IS GAYLA BENTLEY,
OF THE GAYLA BENTLEY
FASHION DESIGN GROUP.
WE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN OUR FIRST
GAYLA BENTLEY FLAGSHIP STORE
IN HOUSTON, TEXAS,
WHERE I'M VERY, VERY POPULAR.
GAYLA, BEAT HIM WITH A STICK.
BEAT HIM WITH A STICK.
OH, MY GOSH.
SO, GAYLA, YOU DON'T HAVE
A STORE NOW?
YOU ONLY WHOLESALE??YOU
WHOLESALE GOODS TOTALLY?
I'VE ONLY BEEN WORKING
IN WHOLESALE, YES.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY?
MY SALES
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS
ARE A LITTLE UNDER
A HALF A MILLION.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
$500,000 OVER 6 YEARS?
OH, NO, A YEAR.
OH, WELL, THAT...
OH, A YEAR.
OH, SORRY, DARLINGS.
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING
UNDER $100,000 A YEAR.
OH, NO, NO, NO. WE COULDN'T
SURVIVE. LOOK AT US.
WE'RE VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE.
WELL, THAT'S??THAT'S??
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS...
YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE MONEY
THAN THAT.
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS GONNA BE
WHAT DO YOU EAT?
WHAT DO YOU SURVIVE ON?
WELL, YOU CAN SEE
WE'RE EATING CARBOHYDRATES.
THAT'S ALL WE CAN AFFORD,
YOU KNOW?
(sharks laugh)
I GOTTA KNOW WHY.
WHY, GAYLA?
YES, CAN I TELL YOU WHY?
(Daymond) YEAH.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CLOTHES
IN THEIR LUXURY RETAIL SPACE
(Robert) IS THAT TRUE, DAYMOND?
(Gayla) THAT'S WHY WE'RE TIRED
OF BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
(Robert) I FIND THAT
HARD TO BELIEVE.
NO, IT'S TRUE.
TO THE WORLD,
LUXURY IS NOT PLUS SIZES.
THIS IS NOT LUXURIOUS?
NOT TO THEM,
NOT TO THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
WE NEED SOMEONE TO BE A PIONEER,
TO BREAK THROUGH.
I JUST WANT TO ASK THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUESTION,
WHICH IS, BARBARA??
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST??
IS THIS SOME GOOD STUFF?
I HAPPEN TO THINK THE CLOTHING'S
BEAUTIFUL, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
(Gayla)
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
BUT IT'S A CROWDED FIELD
IF YOU GO OUT THERE
GAYLA, YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB
OF GETTING TO THIS POINT.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE $250,000
FOR A SECOND, FOR ME.
THANK YOU. OKAY.
WHY DO YOU NOW WANT
TO TAKE $250,000
GAYLA, THERE'S SO MANY
DIFFERENT, UM, PRODUCTS HERE,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT??
MAKE SURE I MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL.
GAYLA, I?I LOVE THE STORY.
I?I HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT
OF RESPECT
FOR THE SALES
YOU BUILT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
THANK YOU.
GAYLA, I CANNOT BE THE PIONEER
WITH THE ARROWS IN MY BACK,
ALL RIGHT?
DARLING, IT'S OKAY.
I AM OUT.
THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
GAYLA, I WAS GONNA SAY IT
BEFORE,
BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT NOW??
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BUT I'M OUT.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
CONSIDER GOING IN HALF, KEVIN?
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU CAN'T SELL
THIS STUFF ON THE AIR.
BARBARA, ARE YOU
ON COMMISSION WITH HER?
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A SHARK WORK SO HARD
(Daymond) YOU GUYS ARE THEIR
FAMILY. YOU GUYS ARE FAMILY.
(Gayla) OH, COME SAY HELLO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(Robert) CONGRATULATIONS.
(Daymond) THANK YOU.
(Gayla whispers) OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS NOT JUST A VICTORY
FOR GAYLA BENTLEY.
IT'S A VICTORY FOR MODERN WOMEN,
FOR ALL SIZES TO HAVE STYLE.
(both) ? MR. PONCHO ?
WE'RE GONNA OFFER YOU $400,000.
UNFORTUNATELY,
I WOULD HAVE TO DECLINE.
WOW.
I'M SPEECHLESS.
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING ME?
WELL, LET'S PULL OUT
A CALCULATOR.
HE GOT A CALCULATOR ON HIM.
YOU'RE SITTING ON MY CARPET
ASKING FOR MONEY,
