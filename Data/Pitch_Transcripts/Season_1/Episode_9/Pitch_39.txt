MY NAME IS GAYLA BENTLEY,
AND I'M A FASHION DESIGNER.
HOLD THAT RIGHT UP.
LET ME SEE
THESE DIFFERENT COLORS.
YEAH.
THERE IS A VOID
IN THE RETAIL WORLD
FOR HIGH?END, BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES
FOR THE MODERN WOMAN,
SIZES 12 AND UP.
YES.
I LOVE THAT.
I CALL HER THE MODERN WOMAN
BECAUSE 60%
OF THE AMERICAN WOMEN
WEAR A SIZE 12 OR ABOVE.
IT'S AMAZING THAT NO ONE IS
REALLY CATERING TO THIS MARKET.
TWIRLY. (laughs)
(woman) TWIRL IT.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT ALL WOMEN
HAVE A CHANCE TO BUY DESIRABLE,
BEAUTIFUL, HIGH?END CLOTHES,
NOT JUST THE SKINNY MODELS
YOU SEE IN THE MAGAZINES.
I HOPE THE SHARKS
WILL HELP ME WITH MY MISSION
AND SEE THAT THIS IGNORED MARKET
IS A GOLD MINE.
MY NAME IS GAYLA BENTLEY,
AND I AM THE DESIGNER
AND FOUNDER
OF THE GAYLA BENTLEY
FASHION DESIGN GROUP.
AND I AM HERE TONIGHT
TO ASK YOU
FOR YOUR WISDOM
AND YOUR EXPERIENCE...
WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?
AND??GOOD QUESTION??
$250,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY.
I AM REPRESENTING 60%
OF THE AMERICAN WOMEN
THAT WEAR A SIZE 12 OR LARGER.
YOU KNOW US.
WE'RE YOUR NEIGHBOR,
YOUR SISTER, YOUR FRIEND.
AND WE ARE TIRED OF BEING
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST,
BEING FORCED TO SHOP
IN THE FAR CORNERS
OF THE DEPARTMENT STORES,
ONLY TO FIND CLOTHES THAT DON'T
FIT AND THAT WE DON'T EVEN LIKE.
I'VE SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS
FOCUSING ON BUILDING
THE GAYLA BENTLEY BRAND??
MODERN SIZES FOR MODERN WOMEN,
SIZES 12 TO 28.
WE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN OUR FIRST
GAYLA BENTLEY FLAGSHIP STORE
IN HOUSTON, TEXAS,
WHERE I'M VERY, VERY POPULAR.
LIKE, BARBARA,
IF YOU AND I WENT SHOPPING,
HOW COME WE HAVE TO SPLIT? "OH,
I'LL SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE.
"I'LL GO UPSTAIRS
WITH MY FLASHLIGHT
"AND TRY TO FIND SOMETHING
TO WEAR. YOU JUST STAY DOWN HERE
ON THE FIRST FLOOR, WHERE
EVERYBODY WILL HELP YOU." OKAY?
THIS IS WHY I WANT TO PUT
THESE TYPE OF THINGS
ON THE FIRST FLOOR,
INTEGRATE THE SIZES.
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO THIS
FOR 30 YEARS NOW.
I'VE BEEN IN RETAIL MANAGEMENT
FOR SAKS FIFTH AVENUE.
BUT YOU'RE ONLY 25.
HOW CAN THAT BE?
OH, MY GOD. DARLING. ANYWAY,
LET ME CONCENTRATE FOR A MOMENT.
(Daymond) THAT'S RIGHT.
(laughs)
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT LARGER?SIZED WOMEN??
AND DON'T BEAT ME WITH A STICK,
'CAUSE I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUT...
OKAY, 'CAUSE THERE ARE
FOUR OF THEM HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, I'LL TRY NOT TO.
DON'T CARE ABOUT FASHION
AS MUCH?
THAT'S WHY THE MARKET
DOESN'T SERVICE THEM?
OH, MY. MY, MY, MY. OH.
GAYLA, BEAT HIM WITH A STICK.
BEAT HIM WITH A STICK.
OH, MY GOSH.
I??NO, BUT, GAYLA, I BELIEVE
THE MARKET ALWAYS SERVES DEMAND.
YES.
THAT'S THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS.
BUT THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE
ONE PIONEER.
IS THAT YOU?
IT'S GONNA BE ME,
WITH YOUR HELP AND WISDOM.
WHAT??CAN YOU TELL US WHAT
THESE ITEMS SELL FOR RETAIL
AS YOU DEMONSTRATE THEM?
YES, THIS WOULD SELL
FOR $470.
$470?
YES. IT'S A LUXURY COAT.
WOW. PRETTY.
IT'S ITALIAN WOOL, VERY
LIGHTWEIGHT AND VERY TAILORED.
WHAT IS THAT COSTING YOU
TO MAKE,
THAT??THE??THE JACKET?
$125.
(Barbara) WOW.
NO.
OKAY. HEY.
(Robert) WOW.
(laughs)
YOU ARE GETTING THAT
AT $125? THAT'S ITALIAN WOOL?
YES.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL JACKET.
THANK YOU.
WHAT RETAIL STORES ARE YOU IN?
I AM ONLINE
WITH NEIMAN MARCUS.
SO, GAYLA, YOU DON'T HAVE
A STORE NOW?
YOU ONLY WHOLESALE??YOU
WHOLESALE GOODS TOTALLY?
I'VE ONLY BEEN WORKING
IN WHOLESALE, YES.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY?
MY SALES
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS
ARE A LITTLE UNDER
A HALF A MILLION.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
$500,000 OVER 6 YEARS?
OH, NO, A YEAR.
OH, WELL, THAT...
OH, A YEAR.
OH, SORRY, DARLINGS.
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING
UNDER $100,000 A YEAR.
OH, NO, NO, NO. WE COULDN'T
SURVIVE. LOOK AT US.
WE'RE VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE.
WELL, THAT'S??THAT'S??
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS...
YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE MONEY
THAN THAT.
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS GONNA BE
WHAT DO YOU EAT?
WHAT DO YOU SURVIVE ON?
WELL, YOU CAN SEE
WE'RE EATING CARBOHYDRATES.
THAT'S ALL WE CAN AFFORD,
YOU KNOW?
(sharks laugh)
SO??
OKAY, GAYLA, SO I'M STUCK
ON ONE THING, AND IT??
OKAY.
THE SKINNY BUYER
THAT BUYS FASHION??
THEY WON'T PUT LARGER SIZES
INTO RETAIL.
I GOTTA KNOW WHY.
WHY, GAYLA?
YES, CAN I TELL YOU WHY?
(Daymond) YEAH.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CLOTHES
IN THEIR LUXURY RETAIL SPACE
OVER A SIZE 12.
YES, I?I UNDERSTAND THAT.
THAT'S WHY THIS IS
SUCH A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
(Daymond) YEAH.
BUT WHY DON'T THEY HAVE THEM?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE "LUXURY"
LOOK. WHEN WE ARE??
(Robert) IS THAT TRUE, DAYMOND?
(Gayla) THAT'S WHY WE'RE TIRED
OF BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
(Robert) I FIND THAT
HARD TO BELIEVE.
NO, IT'S TRUE.
TO THE WORLD,
LUXURY IS NOT PLUS SIZES.
THIS IS NOT LUXURIOUS?
NOT TO THEM,
NOT TO THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
WE NEED SOMEONE TO BE A PIONEER,
TO BREAK THROUGH.
I JUST WANT TO ASK THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUESTION,
WHICH IS, BARBARA??
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST??
IS THIS SOME GOOD STUFF?
I HAPPEN TO THINK THE CLOTHING'S
BEAUTIFUL, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
AND I THINK THE ATTENTION
TO DES??DETAIL, UH,
IS USUALLY VERY EXPENSIVE
TO BE DONE.
(Daymond) RIGHT.
DAYMOND, IS HER IDEA
TO NOW EXPAND THE LINE
BY OPENING UP A FLAGSHIP STORE
THE RIGHT STRATEGY?
IT ALL DEPENDS.
I DON'T KNOW.
I DO BELIEVE THAT SHE CAN
MAKE A NEW SPACE.
I MEAN,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID.
THERE WAS NOT
A YOUNG MEN'S MARKET IN 1990,
UNTIL WE MADE THAT SO?CALLED
"URBAN SPACE." SO SHE??
BUT, DAYMOND, HANG ON A SEC.
IF FASHION IS REALLY ABOUT
THE BRAND, THE DESIGNER,
WHY GO AFTER JUST LARGE?
WHY CAN'T SHE GO AFTER
THE ENTIRE MARKET?
SEE, AND??AND THAT IS
A GOOD POINT, BECAUSE THAT??
SOME OF THESE PIECES, I THINK,
WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE ON ANYBODY.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
I LOVE THIS STUFF.
(Gayla)
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
BUT IT'S A CROWDED FIELD
IF YOU GO OUT THERE
AND??AND PUT THOSE DESIGNS TO??
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BUY
THE LARGE STUFF.
EXCUSE ME. I WANT TO MENTION
THAT I DIDN'T MENTION
IT'S A $30?BILLION?A?YEAR
INDUSTRY,
AND WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
A PIECE OF THAT PIE?
GAYLA, YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB
OF GETTING TO THIS POINT.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE $250,000
FOR A SECOND, FOR ME.
THANK YOU. OKAY.
WHY DO YOU NOW WANT
TO TAKE $250,000
AND OPEN A RETAIL STORE?
AND AS AN INVESTOR, HOW WOULD
I EVER GET MY MONEY
OUT OF SINKING IT
INTO ONE RETAIL LOCATION?
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA ROLL IT OUT
INTO OTHERS.
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST ONE,
IN THE SIMON MALLS.
TH?THIS IS THE WORST TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF RETAIL??
BUT LET ME TELL YOU,
SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER,
THE WHOLESALE WENT DOWN, SO I
HAD TO THINK QUICKLY ON MY FEET,
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO STOP
MY MOMENTUM.
I SAID, "WHY DON'T WE TAKE
THE FRONT PART
OF OUR WHOLESALE SHOWROOM
AND TURN IT INTO RETAIL?"
WE'RE UP 137%, WITH MY AVERAGE
SALE BEING $1,000.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WHY DO YOU NEED $250,000 FROM ME
TO OPEN UP A RETAIL STORE?
WHY NOT JUST DO IT
ON YOUR OWN?
I?I'VE GONE TO THE BANKS,
AND THEY'RE NOT IN THE MOOD
TO LEND RIGHT NOW.
I'M SURE THAT'S THE CASE.
GAYLA, THERE'S SO MANY
DIFFERENT, UM, PRODUCTS HERE,
AND WHEN I DO AN INFOMERCIAL,
I HAVE ONE PRODUCT...
RIGHT.
IN 30 MINUTES.
WHEN I SEE ALL THE SIZES,
AND NOW TO COUPLE THAT
WITH RETAIL,
IT'S A VERY SCARY BUSINESS
FOR ME, SO I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS
TO THE EXPERTS HERE.
BEFORE YOU GO OUT??
BEFORE YOU GO OUT...
YEAH.
WHICH IS??IS THAT
WHERE YOU WERE GOING?
I'M GOING OUT, YEAH.
YOU'RE SURE?
I HAVE TO, YEAH,
BECAUSE IT??IT??
LET ME JUST STOP YOU
A MINUTE. OKAY?
I'VE BEEN WATCHING QVC.
THERE'S SOME ADORABLE LITTLE GUY
THAT DEMONSTRATED
HIS CLOTHING EXACTLY LIKE
SHE'S DEMONSTRATING, AND HE'S
SELLING OFF THE SHELVES.
I HAVE, RIGHT NOW, A HOME
SHOPPING NETWORK PURSUING ME.
I DID NOT WANT TO SIGN
ANY CONTRACTS...
(Barbara) MM?HMM.
UNTIL I CAME TO SEE YOU ALL,
'CAUSE I NEED SOMEONE
WITH YOUR WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE
TO HELP MAKE SURE
I MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL.
AND SHE'S ADORABLE.
SHE'S GOT THAT INSTANT,
THINKING?ON?HER?FEET CHARM.
SHE'S GONNA ROMANCE??
I THINK I'D DO GREAT ON THAT.
WE WANT TO DO THE DEAL,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT??
MAKE SURE I MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL.
GAYLA, I?I LOVE THE STORY.
I?I HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT
OF RESPECT
FOR THE SALES
YOU BUILT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
BUT BRICKS AND MORTAR
IS THE WRONG STRATEGY.
I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT'S WRONG.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT...
WITH A HEAVY HEART.
OKAY, BUT I AM FLEXIBLE,
AND I AM OPEN
TO WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE
THE BEST THING TO DO HERE.
I THINK THE HOME SHOPPING
IS A GOOD WAY TO GO,
BECAUSE I THINK IT BUILDS
MY GLOBAL BRAND,
WITH MORE PEOPLE LOOKING??
I GOTTA GET MY NAME OUT THERE.
BUT ALL ROADS LEAD
TO THIS FACT??
YES OR NO, TRUE OR FALSE??
YOU ARE SHUT OUT OF RETAIL,
WHERE 90% OF CLOTHES ARE SOLD?
OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE REALLY RUTHLESS.
NO. NO. I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
YOU ARE REALLY RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
GAYLA, I CANNOT BE THE PIONEER
WITH THE ARROWS IN MY BACK,
ALL RIGHT?
DARLING, IT'S OKAY.
I AM OUT.
THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
GAYLA, I WAS GONNA SAY IT
BEFORE,
BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT NOW??
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BUT I'M OUT.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
CONSIDER GOING IN HALF, KEVIN?
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU CAN'T SELL
THIS STUFF ON THE AIR.
BARBARA, ARE YOU
ON COMMISSION WITH HER?
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A SHARK WORK SO HARD
TO BRING
SOMEBODY ELSE BACK IN.
I LOVE THIS LADY, AND YOU'RE NOT
GIVING HER THE CHANCE,
AND YOU GUYS AREN'T MARRIED
TO HEAVYSET LADIES. THE TRUTH??
HE'S ON HIS THIRD, FOURTH,
FIFTH??A TROPHY WIFE OR??
WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH MAKING MONEY?
(Barbara) OKAY, ALL SKINNY.
ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ME?
(Robert) WHAT?
SHE TALKING ABOUT YOU?
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
YEAH. I'M TRYING
TO PROMPT HIM TO GET IN,
BECAUSE I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUMP IN ON THIS.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
DAYMOND'S TROPHY WIFE
OR KEVIN'S TROPHY WIFE?
(Barbara) THEY ALL HAVE THEM.
(O'Leary) WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH MAKING MONEY?
I GOT TWO PUPPIES.
I ONLY GOT TWO PUPPIES. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
HERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY
IN AN AREA YOU CAN DO WELL WITH.
OPEN YOUR EARS.
I'LL PUT IN HALF THE MONEY
IF YOU CAN GET THIS
CLOTHING KING AND TELL THEM??
GIVE THEM ONE MORE REASON
TO GO IN WITH YOU.
(sighs)
(Daymond) YOU GUYS ARE THEIR
FAMILY. YOU GUYS ARE FAMILY.
(Gayla) OH, COME SAY HELLO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(Robert) CONGRATULATIONS.
(Daymond) THANK YOU.
I GUESS WE CAN PICK UP OUR SIGNS
AND GO HOME NOW. LET'S GO EAT.
(sharks laughing)
(blows kisses)
(Gayla whispers) OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS NOT JUST A VICTORY
FOR GAYLA BENTLEY.
IT'S A VICTORY FOR MODERN WOMEN,
FOR ALL SIZES TO HAVE STYLE.
(both) ? MR. PONCHO ?
WE'RE GONNA OFFER YOU $400,000.
UNFORTUNATELY,
I WOULD HAVE TO DECLINE.
WOW.
I'M SPEECHLESS.
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING ME?
WELL, LET'S PULL OUT
A CALCULATOR.
HE GOT A CALCULATOR ON HIM.
YOU'RE SITTING ON MY CARPET
ASKING FOR MONEY,
AND I'M TELLING YOU
HOW I'D GIVE IT TO YOU.
$600,000 FOR 50%.
THIS ISN'T MONOPOLY MONEY.
YOU REALIZE THAT, BRIAN?
IT'S A BIG MISTAKE TO (bleep)
WITH ME ON THIS ONE.
ARE YOU??
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?
