HI. MY NAME'S DAN MACKEY.
CAN I SPEAK WITH
YOUR BEVERAGE MANAGER, PLEASE?
I'M A MARKETING GUY.
I KNOW WHAT SELLS.
I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL EXPERIENCE.
I'VE NEVER BROUGHT A PRODUCT
TO MARKET.
I'M NEW TO THIS,
SO I NEED THE SHARKS' HELP.
HI, MY NAME'S DAN MACKEY,
IT HAS ANTIOXIDANTS, VITAMINS,
BUT THE BEST THING??
IT TASTES LIKE REGULAR SODA.
IT IS GOOD.
I BROUGHT A FEW SAMPLES...
OKAY.
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO TASTE.
IS THERE AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER
IN HERE?
(Robert) THANKS, DAN.
THERE IS
NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER.
BECAUSE "ORGANIC" MEANS
THERE'S NO CHEMICALS,
NOTHING ARTIFICIAL WHATSOEVER.
THANK YOU.
WE USE SOMETHING CALLED
AGAVE NECTAR...
OH, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S GOOD.
ON THE MARKET ARE,
LIKE, 160, 180.
OKAY, DAN,
HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU.
SURE.
WHAT IS THE THING
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE LEVERAGE
OF SUCCESS
FOR ALL PLAYERS
IN THE BEVERAGE MARKET?
I HOPE YOU KNOW THIS ANSWER.
YOU GOTTA TASTE GOOD.
NO, NO, NO. NO. NO.
NO. INCORRECT.
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW
DAN, IS THERE A STORE
THAT I CAN GO INTO TODAY
THAT'S NOT BAD.
DAN, YOU JUST GAVE YOURSELF
MOUTH?TO?MOUTH.
DAN, THE $175,00 IN SALES
THAT YOU GOT??
YOU TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT
AVAILABLE ON ANY SHELF.
SO WHERE DID YOU SELL
THE $175,000 TO?
THAT WAS SOLD
TO THE DISTRIBUTOR,
WELL, NO. I MEAN, I'M??
DAN, DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
KNOW THE BEVERAGE BUSINESS
IF YOU'RE GONNA DEVOTE
YOUR LIFE TO IT?
AT LEAST LIE TO ME.
WELL, I'M A MARKETING GUY. I'M
NOT IN THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY.
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
NEVER HAVE EVER TOLD ME
THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW
THAT BUSINESS. I AM OUT.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
FAR MORE THAN $50,000
TO GET OVER THE HUMP HERE.
(Robert)
DAN, LET ME TELL YOU...
YEAH.
I, UH, I THINK
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,
BUT I THINK YOU'RE
AN INCREDIBLY NAIVE GUY.
YOU GOTTA BE IN CONTROL
OF YOUR OWN DESTINY,
DON'T WORRY, DAN, YOU GOT A LOT
MORE HAIR THAN THIS GUY HAS
IN VIRTUAL DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT
WITHOUT THE RISK
FOR HUMAN LIFE.
HOW MUCH WOULD IT BE
FOR PEOPLE'S HOMES?
DO YOU??
IS THERE AN APPLICATION?
IN FUTURE, THE PRICE COULD DROP
MAYBE EVEN TO $10,000,
BUT RIGHT NOW, THE PRICE,
UH, IS $55,000.
