MY NAME'S DAN MACKEY, AND I LIVE
IN SAUSALITO, CALIFORNIA.
I'VE CREATED
A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE
TO SOMETHING AMERICANS CONSUME
IN HUGE QUANTITIES.
I HAVE A FEW TEACHERS
IN MY FAMILY,
AND THEY WERE AMAZED
THAT WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS
GETTING RID OF SODAS
FROM SCHOOL CAMPUSES,
THE THINGS THEY BROUGHT IN
TO REPLACE THEM
WEREN'T ANY HEALTHIER.
THEY WERE JUICES
AND SPORTS DRINKS THAT STILL HAD
AS MANY CALORIES OR MORE THAN
THE SODAS THEY REPLACED.
IT'S LIKE, "OH, THERE'S
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY,
YOU KNOW, HELP ADULTS
AND KIDS AND EVERYONE."
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE
GREAT IDEAS,
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT
AND SEEING A NEED
AND SEEING THAT NO ONE ELSE
IS MAKING THIS HAPPEN??
WELL, I GUESS MAYBE I SHOULD??
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE.
HI. MY NAME'S DAN MACKEY.
CAN I SPEAK WITH
YOUR BEVERAGE MANAGER, PLEASE?
I'M A MARKETING GUY.
I KNOW WHAT SELLS.
I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL EXPERIENCE.
I'VE NEVER BROUGHT A PRODUCT
TO MARKET.
I'M NEW TO THIS,
SO I NEED THE SHARKS' HELP.
WITH THEIR INVESTMENT
AND THEIR EXPERTISE,
I KNOW WE CAN REALLY
MAKE SOMETHING OF THIS.
HI, MY NAME'S DAN MACKEY,
AND I AM THE CREATOR
OF CHILL SODA.
I AM SEEKING
A MINIMUM INVESTMENT OF $50,000
FOR 10% EQUITY.
CHILL IS A TRULY HEALTHY LINE
OF SODA.
I HAVE SOME TEACHERS
IN MY FAMILY.
WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS GETTING RID
OF SODAS FROM SCHOOL CAMPUSES,
WE SAW WHAT
THEY REPLACED THEM WITH??
THESE DIET SODAS
THAT ARE FULL OF CHEMICALS
THAT NO ONE WANTS TO DRINK,
JUICES FULL OF SUGAR.
AND I'M LIKE, "IS THIS
THE BEST THEY GOT?
"IF SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE
A BOATLOAD OF MONEY,
THEY SHOULD INVENT A HEALTHY
SODA." OH, GUESS WHAT. I DID.
CHILL IS
UNIQUELY LOW GLYCEMIC.
IT'S ORGANIC, IT HAS
NO HIGH?FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP,
NO SIMPLE SUGARS,
IT'S NUTRITIOUS,
IT'S LIGHT IN CALORIES,
IT HAS ANTIOXIDANTS, VITAMINS,
BUT THE BEST THING??
IT TASTES LIKE REGULAR SODA.
IT IS GOOD.
I BROUGHT A FEW SAMPLES...
OKAY.
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO TASTE.
IS THERE AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER
IN HERE?
(Robert) THANKS, DAN.
THERE IS
NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER.
BECAUSE "ORGANIC" MEANS
THERE'S NO CHEMICALS,
NOTHING ARTIFICIAL WHATSOEVER.
THANK YOU.
WE USE SOMETHING CALLED
AGAVE NECTAR...
OH, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S GOOD.
AND THAT'S NUTRITIOUS LIKE
HONEY, BUT IT'S LOW GLYCEMIC.
AND IT'S ACTUALLY SWEETER
THAN SUGAR,
SO WE'RE ABLE TO GET
THE SAME SWEETNESS LEVEL
FOR LESS CALORIES.
HOW MANY CALORIES IN ONE CAN?
IN ONE CAN,
WE HAVE 85 CALORIES.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
YOUR TYPICAL SODA IS 140,
AND A LOT OF THE ORGANIC SODAS
ON THE MARKET ARE,
LIKE, 160, 180.
OKAY, DAN,
HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU.
SURE.
WHAT IS THE THING
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE LEVERAGE
OF SUCCESS
FOR ALL PLAYERS
IN THE BEVERAGE MARKET?
I HOPE YOU KNOW THIS ANSWER.
YOU GOTTA TASTE GOOD.
NO, NO, NO. NO. NO.
NO. INCORRECT.
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW
AND IS THE REASON
YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF ME?
WELL...
YOU GOTTA GET THIS.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER IT
FOR ME, 'CAUSE I??
DISTRIBUTION.
SHELF SPACE.
SHELF SPACE.
RIGHT. OKAY. SORRY. I THOUGHT
THAT WAS A GIVEN, BECAUSE??
YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
OH, ACTUALLY, I DO.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
WE ACTUALLY ALREADY HAVE
A DISTRIBUTOR ON BOARD.
THEY'RE
IN 40 DIFFERENT TERRITORIES
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES,
SO WE'RE ROCKING AND ROLLING
ALREADY.
DAN, IS THERE A STORE
THAT I CAN GO INTO TODAY
AND SEE YOUR PRODUCT
ON THE SHELF?
THERE IS NOT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING IN
ON THE GROUND FLOOR
OF THIS THING.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
WE ALREADY HAVE SOLD 250 UNITS,
AND WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE??
250 UNITS??CASES OR PIECES?
CANS.
OKAY...
(laughs)
HOW MUCH DOES 250 CANS OF SODA
AT APPROXIMATELY 40 CENTS EQUAL?
WELL, $175,000.
HOW??WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
250,000 CANS.
(Harrington) 250,000.
THOUSAND.
(O'Leary) ALL RIGHT.
YOU SAID 250 CANS.
I'M SORRY. YEAH, THAT'S NOT
VERY MANY CANS, IS IT?
SO HOW MANY DOLLARS...
(laughs) NO.
HOW MANY DOLLARS HAVE??HAVE YOU
COLLECTED IN SALES FROM THAT?
SO B??FROM THAT,
WE GOT $175,000.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
DAN, YOU JUST GAVE YOURSELF
MOUTH?TO?MOUTH.
DAN, THE $175,00 IN SALES
THAT YOU GOT??
YOU TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT
AVAILABLE ON ANY SHELF.
SO WHERE DID YOU SELL
THE $175,000 TO?
THAT WAS SOLD
TO THE DISTRIBUTOR,
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY HELPING US
WITH THE PRODUCTION RUN.
THEY ARE SO BEHIND IT.
WHY ARE THEY BEING
SO UNBELIEVABLY NICE TO YOU?
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY BEVERAGE MANAGEMENT
COMPANY.
WHAT IS
A BEVERAGE MANAGEMENT COMPANY?
BEVERAGE MANAGEMENT??
IS THAT A CONSULTANT?
THEY ARE CONSULTANTS, YEAH.
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH
ABOUT THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY.
OOH.
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD
HAVE JUST SAID TO ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
(laughs)
WELL, NO. I MEAN, I'M??
DAN, DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
KNOW THE BEVERAGE BUSINESS
IF YOU'RE GONNA DEVOTE
YOUR LIFE TO IT?
AT LEAST LIE TO ME.
WELL, I'M A MARKETING GUY. I'M
NOT IN THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY.
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
NEVER HAVE EVER TOLD ME
THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW
THAT BUSINESS. I AM OUT.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
FAR MORE THAN $50,000
TO GET OVER THE HUMP HERE.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS, AND, UH,
I?I JUST GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU GOT A LOT OF GUTS, AND GOOD
LUCK TO YOU, BUT I'M OUT.
(Robert)
DAN, LET ME TELL YOU...
YEAH.
I, UH, I THINK
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,
BUT I THINK YOU'RE
AN INCREDIBLY NAIVE GUY.
YOU GOTTA BE IN CONTROL
OF YOUR OWN DESTINY,
AND YOU'RE NOT. I'M OUT.
WHEN YOU WOKE UP
TWO YEARS AGO
AND SAID "I WANT TO GO
INTO A BUSINESS,"
WHY DID YOU PICK
THE MOST BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE
CONSUMER GOODS MARKET
IN THE WORLD?
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU DO THAT?
BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESS MODEL
BEHIND IT.
PART OF WHAT I HAVE TO DO
EVERY DAY IS TO??IS TO TRY
AND FIND OPPORTUNITIES WHERE
I PUT MONEY IN HARM'S WAY...
RIGHT.
AND I GET A RETURN.
I DON'T PICK PLACES
WHERE THERE ARE
THOUSANDS OF DEAD
AND ROTTING CORPSES.
THAT'S WHAT
THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY IS.
IT'S GUYS LIKE YOU
GETTING SLAUGHTERED.
AND LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO DEPRESS YOU
OR NOT GIVE YOU
THE MOTIVATION YOU NEED.
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?
I THINK IT'S FRAUGHT
WITH RISK. I'M OUT.
DON'T WORRY, DAN, YOU GOT A LOT
MORE HAIR THAN THIS GUY HAS
AND A LOT MORE ENTHUSIASM.
YOU'RE A LOT MORE POSITIVE
IN MY BOOK.
ARE YOU CUTTING HIM A CHECK?
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT THIS. I LOVE THE PRODUCT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BE AFRAID
OF, SO MAYBE I'M AS NAIVE AS HE.
I GUESS YOU'LL FIND OUT
THE HARD WAY.
HE'S DONE IT RIGHT
FROM THE BEGINNING,
HE'S WORKING FROM HIS HEART,
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK THE BEST TRAIT IS?
YOU'RE NOT SLICK.
YOU STAND THERE
AND YOU ANSWER HONESTLY.
(Robert) HE KNOWS NOTHING.
HEY. LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.
ARE YOU GIVING HIM AN OFFER,
BARBARA?
SHE IS THE TYPE OF PERSON
WE'RE TARGETING.
I MEAN, WE WANT PEOPLE
WHO ARE SMART
AND SEE THE POTENTIAL
IN THIS PRODUCT.
I LOVE THAT
YOU'RE INTERESTED, BARBARA.
BARBARA, PLEASE DON'T
GIVE THIS GUY ANY MONEY. NO!
(Robert) DON'T DO IT.
IN VIRTUAL DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT
WITHOUT THE RISK
FOR HUMAN LIFE.
HOW MUCH WOULD IT BE
FOR PEOPLE'S HOMES?
DO YOU??
IS THERE AN APPLICATION?
IN FUTURE, THE PRICE COULD DROP
MAYBE EVEN TO $10,000,
BUT RIGHT NOW, THE PRICE,
UH, IS $55,000.
AND GOING BACK
TO THE GAMING APPLICATION??
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT I CAN ADD
TO AN EXISTING GAME?
YES, WE CAN. THE BIGGEST
ASSET ABOUT VIRTUSPHERE
IS OUR DIVERSITY IN MARKETS,
FROM MILITARY TO VIDEO GAMES
TO ENTERTAINMENT TO FITNESS.
BUT THIS IS CLEARLY
NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY SELL
TO THE CONSUMER IN THEIR HOME.
YOU'RE THINKING MORE OF
AN ARCADE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS?
VIRTU?VIR?VIRTUAL
ARCADES.
SO AGAIN, BASED ON THE SAME,
UH, PRINCIPLE
AS A PAINTBALL OR LASER TAG,
WE WOULD ADD MULTIPLE SPHERES
IN A ROOM JUST LIKE THIS,
WHERE TEN SPHERES??
PEOPLE WOULD COME IN TOGETHER,
PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER,
INSIDE THE SAME
VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
I?I BUY IT. I SEE
THE APPLICATION. FANTASTIC.
BUT ALL THREE OF US KNOW
THAT YOU ARE LIGHT?YEARS AWAY
FROM A CONSUMER APPLICATION.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
YES.
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY TO MILITARY?
YEAH.
FOR HOW MUCH?
E?EACH OF THEM,
WE'VE SOLD FOR $50,000.
WHAT'S IT COST YOU
TO BUILD ONE OF THESE?
$14,000.
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE TO SELL
IN A YEAR
FOR YOU TO BE PROFITABLE?
30.
30?
YES.
SO I CAN BUY 10% OF YOUR COMPANY
FOR 1 MILLION AND A HALF,
WHICH TELLS ME YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH $15 MILLION,
AND YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY MONEY
YET. IT'S A HELL OF A BET.
WHAT MARKET WOULD YOU PICK
YOU THINK HAS
THE LEAST PATH OF RESISTANCE
TO SELLING 30 OF THESE SPHERES?
THE ARMY RECRUITING CENTERS.
THERE ARE 1,600 RECRUITMENT
CENTERS ACROSS AMERICA,
AND LAST YEAR THEY HAD
A $7.7 BILLION BUDGET.
THE U. S. ARMY ALONE
HAS 400,000 SOLDIERS.
SO AGAIN, WE CAN HELP THEM
RECRUIT NEW STAFF,
AND THEY HAVE AN EXISTING GAME
CALLED "AMERICA'S ARMY."
WE'VE OPENED UP A DISCUSSION
TO MAKE A COMPATIBLE VIRTUSPHERE
WITH THEM.
IMAGINE PUTTING A VIRTUSPHERE
IN AN ARMY RECRUITMENT CENTER.
PEOPLE WILL BE LINING UP
AT THE DOOR
TO AT LEAST TALK TO THEM,
GIVING THEM A HOOK
TO GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR
TO HELP OUR COUNTRY FIGHT WARS
