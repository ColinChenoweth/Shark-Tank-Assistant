GEOFFREY, IF THAT'S TRUE,
WHY AREN'T YOU IN A REAL
HOSPITAL SAVING HUMANKIND?
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU ARE GUILTY
OF MURDERING MONEY.
YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO JAIL.
(man) ? THE BEST THINGS
IN LIFE ARE FREE ?
? BUT THAT AIN'T REALLY
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME ?
? I NEED MONEY ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
? WHAT I WANT ?
? THAT'S WHAT I WANT ?
I'M DR. GEOFFREY BRODERICK,
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER
KRISTINA BRODERICK,
AND OUR COMPANY
IS CORNUCOPIA EXPRESS.
I'VE BEEN A VETERINARIAN
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.
THIS IS A FAMILY PRACTICE.
MY WIFE IS A REGISTERED NURSE.
UM, LOOKS A LITTLE, UM,
LOOKS A LITTLE RED IN THE GUMS.
MY OTHER DAUGHTER MICHELLE
WORKS HERE EVERY DAY.
HOW IS HE?
(makes kissing noises)
(Geoffrey) MY ENTIRE LIFE
AND CAREER
HAS BEEN DEDICATED
TO HELPING ANIMALS.
(whimpers)
WHAT? OH, I KNOW IT. I KNOW.
I CREATED
THESE VERY SPECIAL PRODUCTS
WHICH PROTECT THE ANIMAL
AGAINST DISEASE.
(Kristina) CURRENTLY
OUR PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOLD
AT MY FATHER'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL
IN HUNTINGTON, NEW YORK,
AND ONLINE, BUT I WILL BE
TAKING THIS PRODUCT NATIONALLY
ONCE WE GET THE MONEY
FROM THE SHARKS.
I HOPE AND I KNOW
THE SHARKS ARE GONNA REALIZE
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS
AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE
THIS IS GONNA MAKE TO THE PET
POPULATION OF THIS WORLD.
HI, I'M KRISTINA BRODERICK,
AND THIS IS MY FATHER,
DR. GEOFFREY BRODERICK,
AND THIS IS CASEY.
OUR COMPANY IS
CORNUCOPIA EXPRESS,
AND OUR PRODUCTS ARE
SUPER FOOD AND PHYTO?FOOD,
WHICH ARE PROBIOTICS
FOR DOGS AND CATS.
WE ARE ASKING FOR $300,000
FOR 15% OF OUR COMPANY.
I DEVELOPED THESE PRODUCTS
TO EXTEND THE LIVES OF PETS
BY 50%.
THESE PRODUCTS SAVE PEOPLE
AND PET OWNERS
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY
BY KEEPING THEIR PET HEALTHY
AND DISEASE?FREE.
GEOFFREY, DID YOU SAY YOU EXTEND
THE LIFE OF PETS BY 50%?
YES, 50%.
IS CASEY 28 YEARS OLD?
NOT YET.
NOT YET, BUT CASEY WILL LIVE
TO BE OVER 18.
HOW LONG DOES
A USUAL CASEY LIVE?
UH, THE AVERAGE DOG
IN THE UNITED STATES DIES AT 10.
GEOFFREY, CAN I SEE THE FOOD?
SURE.
AND CAN I SEE CASEY?
(Kristina) OF COURSE.
(Robert) I WANT TO SEE
IF HE'S GONNA EAT IT.
HERE, BABY. HERE, CASEY.
(Kristina) MMM.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
(O'Leary) OH!
LOOK AT THAT. YOU WANT
TO SEE IF A DOG LIKES IT?
DOC, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
GIVING THIS PRODUCT
TO YOUR??YOUR PATIENTS?
OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.
WAIT A MINUTE. WHY ARE
WE FEEDING THAT TO A DOG?
WHAT ABOUT ME?
(Barbara laughs)
WILL IT WORK ON PEOPLE?
THIS IS HUMAN?GRADE.
PEOPLE CAN EAT THIS. HE DOES.
I MAKE A SMOOTHIE EVERY MORNING,
AND I DUMP IT IN THE SMOOTHIE.
IF YOU PUT THIS IN YOUR FOOD,
YOU'LL BE AROUND
TO PLAY WITH ALL THE MONEY
THAT YOU'RE MAKING.
WHAT IS IT? A SUPPLEMENT
I PUT INTO THE PET FOOD?
IT'S A SUPPLEMENT
THAT MAKES THE FOOD WILD AGAIN.
IT BRINGS NATURE
BACK INTO THE FOOD.
BRINGS THE FOOD WILD AGAIN??
I LOVE THAT. DOES IT TASTE GOOD?
TAKE A TASTE. HAVE A BITE.
(Geoffrey) YEAH.
(laughs)
AM I GONNA LIVE FOREVER
IF I EAT THAT?
YOU MIGHT.
(Robert) OH, NO.
(Harrington)
OH, MY GOODNESS.
OH, THAT STINKS.
(Barbara) DON'T DO IT. OH!
(Daymond) CAN I HOLD THE DOG?
IT'S NOT BAD.
BRING ONE OF THOSE OVER HERE.
(Barbara) WHAT DOES IT
TASTE LIKE?
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A LITTLE FUNKY, BUT...
(Robert)
WHAT'S IN IT, GEOFFREY?
(Geoffrey)
THERE ARE ANTIOXIDANTS
AND THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF HERBS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS?
I HAVE RESEARCHED,
IN THE LAST 40 YEARS,
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
TO BRING THIS TO FRUITION.
THEY COME FROM THE LONGEST
LIVING PEOPLE ON THE PLANET.
IN ASIA AND SIBERIA,
I FOUND??
DURING THIS RESEARCH??
THAT THEIR PETS LIVED??
OUTLIVE OTHER PETS TREMENDOUSLY.
IS THERE SOMETHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THIS
OR CAN YOU PATENT THIS?
I'M NOT EVEN CERTAIN.
WE DIDN'T PATENT IT, BECAUSE
IF YOU MAKE OUT A PATENT,
YOU'VE GOT TO DISCLOSE
EVERYTHING THAT'S IN IT,
AND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT
SO THAT IT CAN BE DUPLICATED,
AND PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO
DUPLICATE IT, AND THEY CANNOT.
CAN YOU MAKE THE CLAIM
THAT FLUFFY LASTS 50% LONGER,
OR DO YOU HAVE TO BACK THAT UP
WITH CLINICAL DATA?
WELL, IT'S??IT'S MY OBSERVATION
OVER 40 YEARS.
THIS CAT IS ROCKY.
(Robert) UH, GEOFFREY...
ROCKY'S 24 YEARS OLD,
LIVES IN COLORADO.
(Daymond and O'Leary) 24?
GEOF?GEOF?GEOFFREY,
HANG ON A SEC.
I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR,
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE
IF THIS IS A FUN IDEA
OR IF THERE IS AN ELEMENT
OF, UM...
(O'Leary) QUACKERY?
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT,
ROBERT?
WELL, SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
ABOUT IT.
(O'Leary) OIL?
WHY DO??WHY DO ANIMALS DIE?
THEY DIE AND THEY PASS AWAY
FOR THE SAME REASONS
AS HUMAN BEINGS??DISEASE...
THEY DIE OF HEART DISEASE,
KIDNEY DISEASE,
LIVER DISEASE, CANCER.
RIGHT. ARE YOU SAYING??
VERY SIMPLE??
THAT YOUR PRODUCT CURES
DISEASE AND CANCER IN PETS?
I'M SAYING
THAT I HAVEN'T HAD A CASE
OF CANCER IN MY HOSPITAL
SINCE I CAN REMEMBER.
DR. BRODERICK, I'M SURE YOU
BELIEVE THAT, BUT IN MY WORLD,
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
WILL MAKE YOU PROVE THAT.
(Robert) DO YOU HAVE PROOF?
I'VE BEEN A VETERINARY SURGEON
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.
IN THAT 40 YEARS,
I HAVE SEEN
EVERY... DISEASE IMAGINABLE
VANISH FROM MY PRACTICE.
THERE'S ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE
THAT MAKE THIS KIND OF CLAIM.
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO TRULY BELIEVE IT
AND ARE IGNORANT BECAUSE THEY
DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER.
AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE 'EM
BECAUSE THEY'RE SLICK CON MEN
TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF PEOPLE'S DESIRES AND NEEDS.
OR THERE'S A VET THAT'S HAD
EXPERIENCE FEEDING THIS TO DOGS
THAT HAVE LASTED A LONG TIME.
IS HE IN THAT CATEGORY?
MAYBE HIS CLAIM IS TRUE,
ROBERT.
I FIND IT...
ALMOST OFFENSIVE...
THAT HE'S CLAIMING HE CAN BEAT
CANCER FOR PEOPLE'S PETS.
HE DIDN'T SAY BEAT CANCER.
DID YOU SAY "BEAT" CANCER?
NO, NOT BEAT, NOT CURE,
PREVENT.
BUT, GEOFFREY, YOU REALIZE
THAT IN A SOCIETY
WHERE 50% OF ALL OF US
WILL PROBABLY GET CANCER
IN OUR OLDER AGE,
WHY I'M BEING VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT YOUR FANTASTIC CLAIM?
GEOFFREY, YOU REALIZE
THAT IN A SOCIETY
WHERE 50% OF ALL OF US
WILL PROBABLY GET CANCER
IN OUR OLDER AGE,
WHY I'M BEING VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT YOUR FANTASTIC CLAIM?
OF COURSE YOU'RE??
YOU'RE BEING SKEPTICAL,
BECAUSE YOU WERE LED
TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA DIE
OF CANCER OR HEART DISEASE.
AND YOU'VE DISCOVERED
THE ABILITY FOR ME
NOT TO DO THAT BY TAKING THIS?
EXACTLY.
I DISCOVERED THE ABILITY
FOR ME NOT TO GET IT,
FOR YOU NOT TO GET IT
AND YOUR PET NOT TO GET IT.
GEOFFREY, IF THAT'S TRUE,
WHY THE HELL ARE
WE SELLING PET FOOD?
WHY AREN'T YOU
IN A REAL HOSPITAL
GETTING FUNDING FROM PEOPLE
AND SAVING HUMANKIND?
(O'Leary) MAYBE YOU SHOULD.
WHY ARE WE WASTING OUR TIME
SELLING PET FOOD
WHEN YOU CAN CURE CANCER?
BECAUSE THE ANIMALS ARE
MY CHILDREN. THAT'S WHY.
I'M OUT.
DR. BRODERICK,
YOU NEED DOCUMENTATION,
YOU NEED CLINICAL STUDIES.
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU
BELIEVE IT OR I BELIEVE IT.
ONCE YOU COME INTO
A NATIONAL?TYPE
ADVERTISING SITUATION,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO MAKE THOSE CLAIMS.
THERE IS NO PET FOOD STORE
THAT WILL LET YOU
PUT ON THIS LABEL THE THINGS
THAT YOU'VE SAID HERE TONIGHT.
AND ON THAT NOTE, I'M OUT.
I THINK
YOU'RE TOTALLY CREDIBLE,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROOF,
AND FOR THAT, IT'S SOMETHING
I JUST COULD NOT
PUT MY MONEY IN, SO I'M OUT.
DR. GEOFFREY AND KRISTINA,
I LOST BOTH OF MY DOGS
AFTER 13 YEARS.
I LOST THEM LAST YEAR.
BUT I CAN'T LET THE STRINGS
OF MY HEART MAKE THIS DECISION.
I AM OUT.
I, PERSONALLY,
BELIEVE YOUR STORY.
THE CHALLENGE IS
MARKETING THIS STUFF.
ALL WE CAN SAY IS THIS STUFF
LOOKS LIKE IT WORKS,
BUT WE CAN'T MAKE THE CLAIM,
'CAUSE THERE'S NO STUDY
SUPPORTING IT.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
TAKE IT HOME FOR YOUR PET,
BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
(Geoffrey)
PREVENTING IS ONE THING.
WE NEVER SAID WE CURED CANCER,
BUT THIS IS WHAT, YOU KNOW,
SOME??SOME PEOPLE WERE HEARING.
GUYS,
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?
THE GUY IS TELLING YOU
HE CAN PREVENT CANCER.
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.
(Barbara) HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.
(Daymond) HE DIDN'T
SAY THAT, ROBERT.
HE DID NOT SAY THAT.
HE SAID IN HIS CASES??
HIS EXPERIENCE WAS HE HAD
LESS SICKNESS IN HIS PRACTICE.
IT'S EITHER A FACT OR IT ISN'T.
I BELIEVE IN MY FATHER,
AND I BELIEVE IN HIS PRODUCTS,
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
YOU CANNOT PUT A PRICE
OR A DOLLAR SIGN
ON THE LIFE OF AN ANIMAL.
SO I BELIEVE
IN WHAT WE'RE DOING,
AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE
DOING WHAT WE DO.
TIFFANY, I'VE MADE YOU
A GOOD OFFER.
YES.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?
DO YOU WANT IT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOUR OFFER.
I'M SO HAPPY. WE'RE GONNA MAKE
MONEY ON THIS TOGETHER.
I WENT INTO THE SHARK TANK,
AND I CAME OUT WITH A $50,000
INVESTMENT FROM BARBARA.
AND I WENT FROM THIS,
MY HOMEMADE PROTOTYPE,
TO OUR FINISHED PRODUCT,
AVA THE ELEPHANT.
(man) I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO STUART AMOS, OUR C. E. O.
TODAY WE'RE AT FLAVORx,
ONE OF THE BIGGEST
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES
IN THE U. S.,
AND THEY WANT TO PUT
AVA THE ELEPHANT
IN PHARMACIES
ACROSS THE NATION.
I'LL TAKE UP THE RIGHT AMOUNT
OF MEDICINE.
AVA THE ELEPHANT IS A MEDICINE
DISPENSER FOR CHILDREN.
SHE IS A CUTE LITTLE ELEPHANT
THAT HIDES MEDICINE
IN HER TRUNK.
IT'S GREAT.
IT SEEMS LIKE A PERFECT MARRIAGE
TO, UM, YOU KNOW,
TO BRING YOUR PRODUCT TOGETHER
WITH OUR FLAVORING,
WHICH IS IN 40,000 PHARMACIES
NATIONWIDE.
SINCE FILMING THE SHOW,
I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER.
UM, I HAD TO TAKE
A LITTLE BREAK IN THE MIDDLE
TO, UM, HAVE SURGERY
AND DO RADIATION,
AND NOW I AM CANCER?FREE
AND BACK TO WORK, SO...
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
SHE NEVER REALLY TOOK A BREAK,
BECAUSE SHE WAS WORKING
FROM THE HOSPITAL BED
RIGHT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.
AMAZING. JUST AMAZING.
BARBARA AND I ARE JET?SETTING
AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,
PRETTY MUCH,
FROM MEETING TO MEETING.
AND EVEN BEING ROMANCED
ON A YACHT??
NOW THAT'S AN UNUSUAL BUSINESS
DEAL, AND WE'RE GONNA ENJOY
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.
(Tiffany) YES.
HELLO. NICE TO SEE YOU, TIFFANY.
HI. NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
WE'RE ON TRACK TO MAKE MILLIONS
WITH THIS PRODUCT,
AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU,
IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PRODUCT
WITH THE RIGHT PERSON,
ANYONE CAN SUCCEED.
