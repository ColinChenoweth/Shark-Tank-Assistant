GEOFFREY, IF THAT'S TRUE,
WHY AREN'T YOU IN A REAL
HOSPITAL SAVING HUMANKIND?
I'M DR. GEOFFREY BRODERICK,
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER
KRISTINA BRODERICK,
(Kristina) CURRENTLY
OUR PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOLD
AT MY FATHER'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL
IN HUNTINGTON, NEW YORK,
HI, I'M KRISTINA BRODERICK,
GEOFFREY, DID YOU SAY YOU EXTEND
THE LIFE OF PETS BY 50%?
YES, 50%.
IS CASEY 28 YEARS OLD?
NOT YET.
NOT YET, BUT CASEY WILL LIVE
TO BE OVER 18.
HOW LONG DOES
A USUAL CASEY LIVE?
UH, THE AVERAGE DOG
IN THE UNITED STATES DIES AT 10.
GEOFFREY, CAN I SEE THE FOOD?
(Kristina) OF COURSE.
(Robert) I WANT TO SEE
IF HE'S GONNA EAT IT.
HERE, BABY. HERE, CASEY.
(Kristina) MMM.
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
(O'Leary) OH!
LOOK AT THAT. YOU WANT
TO SEE IF A DOG LIKES IT?
DOC, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
GIVING THIS PRODUCT
TO YOUR??YOUR PATIENTS?
OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.
WAIT A MINUTE. WHY ARE
WE FEEDING THAT TO A DOG?
WHAT ABOUT ME?
(Barbara laughs)
WILL IT WORK ON PEOPLE?
THIS IS HUMAN?GRADE.
PEOPLE CAN EAT THIS. HE DOES.
TAKE A TASTE. HAVE A BITE.
(Geoffrey) YEAH.
(laughs)
AM I GONNA LIVE FOREVER
IF I EAT THAT?
YOU MIGHT.
(Robert) OH, NO.
(Harrington)
OH, MY GOODNESS.
OH, THAT STINKS.
(Barbara) DON'T DO IT. OH!
(Daymond) CAN I HOLD THE DOG?
IT'S NOT BAD.
BRING ONE OF THOSE OVER HERE.
(Barbara) WHAT DOES IT
TASTE LIKE?
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A LITTLE FUNKY, BUT...
(Robert)
WHAT'S IN IT, GEOFFREY?
(Geoffrey)
THERE ARE ANTIOXIDANTS
THIS CAT IS ROCKY.
(Robert) UH, GEOFFREY...
GEOF?GEOF?GEOFFREY,
HANG ON A SEC.
I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR,
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE
IF THIS IS A FUN IDEA
OR IF THERE IS AN ELEMENT
OF, UM...
(O'Leary) QUACKERY?
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT,
ROBERT?
WELL, SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
ABOUT IT.
(O'Leary) OIL?
WHY DO??WHY DO ANIMALS DIE?
DR. BRODERICK, I'M SURE YOU
BELIEVE THAT, BUT IN MY WORLD,
THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
WILL MAKE YOU PROVE THAT.
(Robert) DO YOU HAVE PROOF?
I'VE BEEN A VETERINARY SURGEON
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.
IN THAT 40 YEARS,
I HAVE SEEN
EVERY... DISEASE IMAGINABLE
VANISH FROM MY PRACTICE.
THERE'S ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE
THAT MAKE THIS KIND OF CLAIM.
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO TRULY BELIEVE IT
BUT, GEOFFREY, YOU REALIZE
THAT IN A SOCIETY
WHERE 50% OF ALL OF US
WILL PROBABLY GET CANCER
IN OUR OLDER AGE,
WHY I'M BEING VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT YOUR FANTASTIC CLAIM?
GEOFFREY, YOU REALIZE
THAT IN A SOCIETY
WHERE 50% OF ALL OF US
WILL PROBABLY GET CANCER
IN OUR OLDER AGE,
WHY I'M BEING VERY SKEPTICAL
ABOUT YOUR FANTASTIC CLAIM?
OF COURSE YOU'RE??
YOU'RE BEING SKEPTICAL,
BECAUSE YOU WERE LED
TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA DIE
OF CANCER OR HEART DISEASE.
GEOFFREY, IF THAT'S TRUE,
WHY THE HELL ARE
WE SELLING PET FOOD?
WHY AREN'T YOU
IN A REAL HOSPITAL
DR. BRODERICK,
YOU NEED DOCUMENTATION,
YOU NEED CLINICAL STUDIES.
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU
BELIEVE IT OR I BELIEVE IT.
ONCE YOU COME INTO
A NATIONAL?TYPE
ADVERTISING SITUATION,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO MAKE THOSE CLAIMS.
THERE IS NO PET FOOD STORE
THAT WILL LET YOU
PUT ON THIS LABEL THE THINGS
THAT YOU'VE SAID HERE TONIGHT.
(Geoffrey)
PREVENTING IS ONE THING.
WE NEVER SAID WE CURED CANCER,
BUT THIS IS WHAT, YOU KNOW,
SOME??SOME PEOPLE WERE HEARING.
GUYS,
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?
THE GUY IS TELLING YOU
HE CAN PREVENT CANCER.
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.
(Barbara) HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.
(Daymond) HE DIDN'T
SAY THAT, ROBERT.
HE DID NOT SAY THAT.
HE SAID IN HIS CASES??
HIS EXPERIENCE WAS HE HAD
LESS SICKNESS IN HIS PRACTICE.
