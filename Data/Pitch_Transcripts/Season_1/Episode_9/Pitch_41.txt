HELLO.
MY NAME IS RAY LATYPOV.
I AM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
OF VIRTUSPHERE, INC.
HELLO. MY NAME IS
JIM DIMASCHIO,
AND I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING
OFFICER OF VIRTUSPHERE, INC.
WE ARE SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF 1 AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS,
AND WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER
10% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
WHOA.
YIKES.
WOW.
YOU ARE ONE CRAZY CHICKEN.
VIRTUSPHERE IS A VIRTUAL REALITY
LOCOMOTION SIMULATOR
THAT IS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY
CHANGE SIMULATION TRAINING.
VIRTUSPHERE IS ALSO
GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE
VIRTUAL ENTERTAINMENT
BY ALLOWING PEOPLE
TO PLAY INSIDE
THEIR FAVORITE VIDEO GAMES.
WE'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
A DEMONSTRATION,
WHICH RAY IS GONNA PERFORM
FOR YOU.
(O'Leary) WHOA.
OH! (laughs)
OUR HARDWARE SET CONSISTS
OF A 10?FOOT SPHERE
WHICH IS PLACED ON A SPECIAL
PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS THE SPHERE
TO ROTATE, UH, FREELY,
IN ANY DIRECTION,
ACCORDING TO USER STEPS.
WHAT HE SEES
IN THE HEAD MOUNT DISPLAY,
YOU'RE WATCHING ON THE MONITOR.
WE TRANSMIT
A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
TO OUR WIRELESS
HEAD MOUNT DISPLAY,
AND THE USER CAN MOVE FREELY
360 DEGREES,
GETTING THE MOST IMMERSIVE
VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE.
I GOTTA TRY THIS.
OKAY.
CAN I GO INSIDE?
SURE.
(O'Leary) YEAH? LET'S GO.
WHAT IS THE END PURPOSE,
THOUGH?
WHY DOES SOMEBODY NEED TO GET
INTO THERE TO DO THAT?
FOR COMBAT TRAINING.
WE CAN PUT A SOLDIER
IN THE MIDDLE OF BAGHDAD AND GO
THROUGH SIMULATION TRAINING,
BOTH AS A SINGLE
AND AS A MISSION REHEARSAL
AS A TEAM.
(O'Leary) SO, UH, ALL RIGHT.
YOUR??YOUR HEAD INSIDE.
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
YEAH. YEAH.
AND NOW YOU COULD
STEP INSIDE.
ONE MORE STEP, PLEASE.
SMALL STEPS. THANK YOU.
AND PLEASE WAIT.
WE WILL CLOSE THE HATCH.
SEAL ME
INTO THE PLEASURE DOME.
(Barbara and Daymond laugh)
(beep)
OKAY, SO I'M LOOKING
AT THE TELEVISION SCREEN,
AND I'M WALKING.
(Ray) BE CAREFUL.
BE CAREFUL.
WHOA.
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.
REALLY?
(O'Leary) YEAH.
NOW AND AGAIN,
AS YOU CAN WATCH,
HE'S PHYSICALLY MOVING
IN HIS VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT,
SO NOW HE'S MOVING DOWN
THE FIXTURE OF THE WALL.
YEAH, BABY.
GERBIL IN THE RAT RACE.
(Jim) AND WHEN HE LOOKS DOWN,
HE'LL SEE THE SIDEWALK.
WHEN HE'LL LOOK UP,
HE'LL SEE THE BLUE SKY.
(O'Leary) OKAY,
I'VE GOT IT, GUYS.
DID YOU GET DIZZY AT ALL?
DID YOU GET DIZZY?
(Barbara) YEAH,
DID YOU GET DIZZY INSIDE?
IT'S PRETTY WILD.
REALLY? DID YOU FEEL DIZZY?
IT'S DISORIENTING. IT TAKES
SOME TIME TO GET USED TO.
(Daymond) FEEL A LITTLE
DISORIENTED THERE?
SO THE PURPOSE IS
TO TRAIN MARINES?
ABSOLUTELY. TRAIN ANY SOLDIERS
ON THE GROUND.
IMAGINE, WITH VIRTUSPHERE,
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE
TO BE TRAINED
ACROSS THE NATION.
JIM, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH THE MONEY?
THERE ARE 59 MILITARY BASES
THAT WE'VE TARGETED
THROUGHOUT AMERICA TO GO VISIT,
TO DEMONSTRATE,
TO PROVE A CONCEPT. WE CAN GO
TO THE THEME PARK INDUSTRY.
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
THE FARTHER AWAY
I THINK THIS IS
FROM A CONSUMER APPLICATION,
IF EVER.
WHAT??WHAT DO YOU??
WHAT DO YOU THINK, KEVIN?
I??
DO YOU EVER SEE THIS
GOING TO A CONSUMER LEVEL?
I'M??I'M REALLY TORN ON THIS.
I SEE IT
AS AN ARCADE OPPORTUNITY.
I MEAN, YOU THINK ABOUT??
THE AVERAGE HOME IS NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE
THAT SPHERE IN.
"HONEY, THE DOME IS HERE."
(laughs)
(O'Leary) LIKE,
THINK ABOUT THAT. IT IS UNIQUE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION. I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
THANK YOU.
BUT I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
JIM, I?I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS.
YEAH. YEAH.
IF THIS BECAME
A CONSUMER APPLICATION,
THERE'D BE, I THINK,
A LOT OF LIABILITY
FROM PEOPLE GETTING HURT
INSIDE THE BALL.
AND SECONDLY, IT'S??
I THINK IT'S A LONG TIME
BEFORE I WOULD GET
MY MONEY BACK, SO I'M OUT.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
IT'S SUCH A BOY THING.
I CAN'T EVEN RELATE TO IT,
AND IT'S CERTAINLY TOO RICH
FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.
I THINK YOU NEED
A STRATEGIC PARTNER,
WHICH I WOULD NOT BE ABLE
TO ASSIST YOU WITH THIS.
I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF MAINTENANCE
AND??AND A WORLD OF THINGS
I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT. I'M OUT.
I'VE NEVER HAD AN IDEA
IN THE SHARK TANK
THAT I LOVED THIS MUCH.
IT JUST??IT'S SO EARLY,
AND THERE'S NO DATA.
WE JUST DON'T KNOW
WHO'S GONNA BUY IT.
HAVING SOLD 10 OR 15 OF THEM,
IT'S??IT'S SO FAR AWAY
FROM THE 1 AND A HALF MILLION
YOU'RE ASKING FOR.
IT'S A TOUGH ONE.
UM...
TOO MANY QUESTIONS. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
(Daymond) GOOD LUCK.
IT??IT IS PRETTY AMAZING.
