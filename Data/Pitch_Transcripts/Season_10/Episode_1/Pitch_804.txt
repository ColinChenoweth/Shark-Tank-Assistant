an epic milestone ??
for the first time ever, a
former "Shark Tank" entrepreneur
achieves the ultimate goal...
?Welcome.
?...and returns as a Shark.
"Shark Tank" has inspired
a nation to chase their dreams.
Man:
This has been a lot of my life,
and I just want to share
that with people.
There is a tenacity that I have,
and nothing's gonna stop me.
What you've done
is just inspiring.
Narrator: And the dream
continues now.
Kevin,
they say you're wrong.
I'm never wrong.
I'm always right.
I will make you
a millionaire.
Look, I'm rich.
I'm really, really, really rich.
?Ha ha!
?Oh, my God!
?We got a deal!
?Welcome to "Shark Tank".
Look, I'm just an investor
trying to scratch out
a living here, okay?
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Emma.
And my name's Miles.
We're offering 5% of our
company, FinalStraw,
for $625,000.
?Ooh.
?Whoo.
Sharks,
maybe you've noticed
that our oceans are filling up
with plastic trash.
Much of that trash is made of
a seemingly harmless item ??
the plastic straw.
Straws may not seem
like a big deal to you,
but they're one of the top items
littering our beaches,
and some of the more sensitive
ocean creatures are pissed.
[ Laughter ]
What is this place?
Shark Tank!
Sharks? Oh, please.
Ah, you think sharks
are scary?
I'm more freaked out
by the 500 million straws
we use every day in the U. S.
Yeah. It's a big number
to get your head around.
Here's what it looks
like every second.
[ Greiner gasps ]
?[ Laughing ] Oh!
?Whoa!
Sharks,
this is 5,700 straws.
This is how many straws we use
every second in the U. S.
Wow.
Plastic straws
are going out of style.
They're getting banned in cities
and countries around the world.
We thought there had
to be a better way
to design
the drinking straw.
So we did.
This is FinalStraw.
FinalStraw is the world's first
reusable, collapsible straw.
It folds up and fits in a case
the size of a car key
and is small enough
to go on your key chain
or in your pocket.
The anti?plastic?straw movement
is growing rapidly,
and we are at
the forefront.
Sharks,
the mermaids need our help.
So, who wants to help us
suck responsibly?
We have samples?
We do.
We have samples.
?Let's go.
?Bye.
[ Laughter ]
Bye, mermaid!
Greiner: Very cute ??
cute actress.
Emma:
We've got the Healthy Coral.
We've got Shark?Butt Gray
for you.
?Shark?Butt Gray?
?Shark?Butt?
Yeah, and then you get
the Arctic?melt Blue.
And this is our
Suck?ulent Green.
?Suck?ulent Green.
?Yep.
John: So, where did you get
all these straws from?
?They're used straws, right?
?A lot of these were found on ??
Yeah.
These are all used straws.
?Wow.
?We've got an artist in Malibu
who's working on
an installation
to show the impacts of
single?use plastic straws,
and she's been collecting
them from restaurants.
?She turns it to art.
?I got ?? I got it.
She's turning this into art.
It's pretty clear
that this is a massive movement
you may have all seen.
There were some scientists
doing research on sea turtles,
and they found a turtle,
and they noticed something
in its nostril and found that
it was a full?length straw
stuck up this
turtle's nose.
?Wow.
?What's your backgrounds?
Um, so, I just finished up
my master's at Harvard
in environmental management
and sustainability.
And while I was getting
my master's, I was working
at Los Alamos
National Laboratory
in waste minimization.
Oh, yeah, some just bobo
that fell off a truck.
[ Laughs ]
You know what
you're doing.
?What's your background?
?And, Miles?
Miles: My background is ??
I was working on the straw.
We had a mutual friend.
This mutual friend said,
"Hey, you need to call
my friend Emma
because she's
the straw girl.
She hates plastic straws."
So, I called Emma up and learned
about her background
and that she had given a TEDx
talk on plastic straws.
How much does this cost to make?
$5.
So...
What do you sell it for?
$20.
$20.
?$20.
?Oh!
?Too expensive.
?It's expensive.
You came in asking
for $625,000 for 5%.
Now, typically, no one comes in
with that kind of ask
unless they have some kind
of sales to back that up.
We ?? We've definitely sold
a few so far.
So, we launched this company
two months ago on Kickstarter.
We ran our Kickstarter for 30
days and raised $1.89 million...
Whoa.
...on Kickstarter.
So, have you shipped anything?
So, the Kickstarter will
fulfill in November.
Oh, okay.
And since we launched
on Kickstarter,
we started doing pre?sales
on our website
and have done $15,000
a day in sales.
Really?
Guys, the world's largest
coffee chain
does 2 billion straws a year.
?Yes.
?Yep.
Now, they've started
to investigate using paper.
It increases their cost
by 4 1/2 times,
and they are in hot liquid.
They get very soggy
at the bottom.
Emma: So, first of all,
paper straws ??
though they won't end up in
a turtle's nose like that,
it's still single?use.
You still have to use a ton of
energy, a ton of water, and ??
?You got to do the same here.
?You're absolutely ??
You know what? No,
you're spot?on about that.
Yeah.
I love the mission here,
but there's really dozens
and dozens of straws out there
to do what yours is doing.
Yours, I think, is clever and
good, but you haven't sold them
and gotten them into
people's hands yet.
I like a product to be in hand
and know that it's
really working.
I'm sorry, I'm out.
?Thank you. Thanks, Lori.
?Thanks, Lori.
O'Leary:
You're not really a company yet.
You're a mission with a product.
The only way this works for an
investor is to structure a deal
where they get their capital
back on a scheduled way.
Thought you'd say that.
Yes, he would say that...
Yeah. He would.
...'cause that's the only way
it's gonna work.
There's so much risk.
Here's an offer for you.
I'll do the $625,000.
I want 10%.
But I want a royalty
of $2 a straw
?'cause you can afford it...
?Whew.
Ooh.
...until I've got back...
$1.8 million.
So, I ?? I get a return
on my money.
Okay.
Siminoff:
You have a great mission.
This problem needs
to be solved.
I mean, and ?? and ?? and seeing
these straws just ??
It makes me sick.
One second.
This is one second.
It ?? It's sickening.
Count to 60.
Yeah.
Well, what worries me, though,
is changing consumer behavior.
It's just, am I gonna carry
another box in my pocket?
Cuban: Well, it's not
just carrying it.
Before that, you've
got to educate them
and then get them to buy it.
Yeah.
So, for that, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, Jamie.
So, I love your cause, and you
are the Straw Whisperer,
it sounds like.
[ Laughter ]
But, you know, listen, you're
talking about $20 straws.
Sure.
And, you know,
we're talking about
1% of the market
would buy this at $20.
The rest are sold
in commercial use.
This isn't for
commercial use.
This is for ??
Right,
but that's my point.
I think that's your biggest
challenge here ??
that 95% of the market are
really just trying to get straws
and not increase
their cost of living.
And that few will go to this,
and you're not gonna be able
to scale as big
as I think you can
for this valuation,
so I'm out.
We appreciate that.
Here's the thing
about $20 straws.
People spend $20
at Starbucks.
They spend it going out
on a Saturday night.
And what people say on our
reviews is, "Oh, my gosh,
I'm gonna save my money
to get this straw,"
because it's really
important to them.
Look, as you speak,
Sharks are dropping out.
Now, on "Shark Tank,"
when you have an offer
and the other options
start to go away,
the Shark that made you
the offer
starts to feel very frisky.
Emma and Miles have one offer
on the table from Kevin
for their reusable straw
company, FinalStraw.
John:
You got an offer here.
Did you guys like
Kevin's offer?
Um, so, Kevin.
We want a partner.
We want someone who's gonna,
you know, be in there with us.
Okay, I'll help you out.
I'll help you out, Emma,
'cause you're feeling
really bold.
Let her finish, let her finish,
let her finish.
Let me ?? Let me talk
a little about my product.
I'll help you out.
[ Laughs ]
I'm out.
Ohh.
Good luck.
Cuban: Look,
I have lots of concerns.
Competition and knock?offs,
first and foremost.
Mm?hmm.
I'll make you an offer, but it's
gonna be a Sharky offer.
I'll give you
the $625,000,
but I want 25%
of the company
because I think you have
a lot of question marks
in terms of the business side,
the finances side.
Yeah.
The online side,
you seem to have
done pretty well.
Well, and I think to
the marketing, you know,
what is so cool
about our product
is people's passion
behind it.
He gave you an offer.
Yeah.
Don't talk your way
out of it.
Now we got to talk business.
No, I'm not gonna talk
my way out of it.
So, Mark, we really appreciate
your offer, you know.
The valuation you gave us
is $2 million,
and we've already done more than
that in sales in two months.
So, what we'd like
to offer you
is $625,000 for 12.5%.
No, thank you. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.
?All the best, guys.
?Good luck.
Greiner:
That was interesting.
O'Leary: They have no idea
what's ahead for them.
?But sometimes ??
?They remind me of Bambi jumping
around in the forest
and then...
Siminoff: I think this
is an execution business.
?The demand is 100% there.
?It's marketing.
It's ?? It's can you execute
against the other people
that are gonna try
to kill Bambi?
Wow, I can't believe
it's been 200 episodes
and five years since Scrub Daddy
first appeared on "Shark Tank".
"Shark Tank's"
not only changed my life,
but the lives of everybody
here at Scrub Daddy!
All: A decade of dreams!
Thanks, "Shark Tank"!
Whoo!
