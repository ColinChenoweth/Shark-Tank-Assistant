Hello.
I am Heidi Santiago,
and this is
my brilliant husband.
I'm Cory Santiago, and we are
here from Spokane, Washington.
We are seeking $100,000
for a 20% stake in our business,
Bear Minimum.
We've created the next evolution
in camping cookware,
and we are changing the way
you eat outdoors.
Now, back in the olden days,
travelers would pack
their covered wagons
with pots and pans.
But they took up so much space
and weighed a ton.
Then came the invention
of the nesting pot,
but it was still so bulky.
Today, we have the Bear Bowl ??
the cook pot
that folds flat.
[ Vocalizes ]
[ Laughter ]
The Bear Bowl
is a super?small...
O'Leary: That's scary.
...lightweight, collapsible
cook pot,
and with just four folds
and two snaps...
Aah!
[ Laughter ]
...it's so simple
to put together,
you can even do it
during a bear attack.
Mostly.
[ Laughter continues ]
He's so cute.
The Bear Bowl is made
out of food?grade,
flame?resistant material,
and it comes
in three sizes.
And because
it opens flat,
it is the easiest
to clean.
So, we are looking
for a Shark
or Sharks who aren't
afraid of bears.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Alright.
We have some
samples for you.
?Good.
?Nice.
?That was very good.
Now the bear's gonna wipe out
'cause he can't see.
Greiner: Super cute.
Oh, the bear gives it to us.
[ Laughing ]
Thank you.
We also have
a campground favorite
that's been warmed up on
a Bear Bowl ?? hot chocolate.
Oh, thanks, Mr. Bear.
What.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Cooked in the Bear pot?
?Correct.
Bear Bowl.
Bear Bowl.
What is the material?
What's this?
It's a PTFE?coated
fiberglass.
So, have you protected this with
some kind of utility patent?
We have a utility patent.
Granted?
Not granted yet, and ??
Have you been
knocked off yet?
No.
?Are you selling it yet?
?Have you been to market yet?
We did a Kickstarter.
We started
with a $1,000 goal
and we reached $40,000
at the end of the campaign.
I'm so excited.
I figured it out.
It's really a puzzle.
So, this
is a metal bottom.
Correct.
So, that's where
the heat's gonna hit.
What's the highest temperature
this'll get to
before it could melt?
We're ?? You know,
we're rating it at like 550.
The entire body
can take flame
but just not a lot
of direct flame.
It will not melt?
No.
Campers, of course,
love it,
but, you know, we have this
whole, wide market of ??
Campers love
to buy stuff.
Yes, they do.
You know, like, have
you ever gone to one
of those camping stores?
They do...
Yeah.
...and they buy
everything there.
But the only reason I think
people go camping
?is to buy stuff.
?For the cool gear, and ??
What's ?? What's
your background?
I ?? I've worked in
manufacturing most of my career.
I came to a crossroads
where I was out of a job.
My wife was just finishing up
a tour for, uh, Broadway.
?National Broadway tour.
?What show?
"Ragtime."
The Broadway musical.
"Ragtime?"
[ Vocalizing ]
See!
Very good, and I give
voice lessons.
[ Vocalizes ]
So, you are in theater?
Okay, so, I grew up
in the country.
When I graduated,
I married my husband,
who had three children, and then
we had two children together.
You have five kids?
Yeah.
Wow.
Where are you guys
at with it?
Like, how much did
you invest?
Everything's in.
We've earned about
just under $90,000
with the Kickstarter
and everything else
in mostly
crowdfunding.
And s?? a bunch
of sweat equity.
But what's the number?
What's the number?
Hours and hours.
Not a lot of capital.
?That's okay. No.
?Yeah, no.
What we did was ??
We don't have ?? I'm working
five jobs to keep us ??
I'm fascinated with
Wonder Woman here.
You are working five
part?time jobs.
Really, she calling me
Wonder Woman.
There you go.
What are those jobs?
Um, I teach English to
Chinese children online.
[ Voice breaking ]
I give voice lessons. I, um...
Why is this so emotional
for you?
Can you share?
It just h?? kind of
happened that ??
We both were unemployed
at the same time.
Our ?? We were both unemployed
at the same time.
The ?? The big piece of it
that we're hesitant to share
is that we did bring
a product to market
back in 2008.
And we put everything ??
every dime and penny into it.
And there was a...
[ Sighs ]
It was bad timing, but
we don't like to give up.
[ Sniffles ]
And our middleman ??
long story short ??
ran off with our money...
Oh, no.
...and we never
heard from him again.
[ Sniffles ]
And it was everything
we had.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, when you ??
and which we learned.
We learned so much from it.
I don't want this to be
a victim story at all.
We are not giving up.
We will do whatever it takes,
and it's a great product.
And I ?? I'm just
emotional...
Cuban: H?Heidi ??
No, it's a beautiful,
beautiful story.
...because you guys ??
No, you guys are amazing.
I wish you weren't afraid
of telling that story
because,
as people stand here,
they will make this seem like
everything was so easy.
We go, "What the hell
are you here for?"
So now we know
why you're here,
because you went
through everything
and you still
got a passion.
Okay, so now I'm an investor.
You're asking me for $100,000.
Yes.
What's the plan?
So, the plan is, is we ??
we have already now
set up with a manufacturer
overseas.
Okay.
Uh, yeah.
And they've delivered
product to you.
And they've given us some
prototype samples...
Oh.
...and now we're
waiting for ??
So, you say you got
manufacturing nailed.
Yes, we got
manufacturing ??
And what's the cost
to deliver it here?
$6.90 for the small ones.
So, it costs you 7 bucks to make
and land it here?
How much do you sell it for?
$29.90.
Greiner:
And that's the baby.
That's the baby.
O'Leary: $29.95 to...
All these numbers
are for the baby.
...but you're not going
to sell it to a retailer
or a wholesaler?
We can go distribution.
?Camping stores.
?Camping stores, yeah.
?Yeah.
?Online.
?Um, social media, as well.
?Have you gone to any shows ??
camping shows and ??
?We haven't ??
We haven't done
any shows yet.
?Oh, you should.
?Yeah, no, we ?? Yeah.
You'll do amazing there.
It'll be ??
It'll be great there.
So you got a lot of ??
You got a lot of work ahead.
You don't ?? It doesn't sound
like you got a plan yet.
?We have a plan.
?Yeah, no, yeah.
Siminoff: You know what I love
about you guys is ??
is ?? is, like ??
We haven't even st??
told our plan yet.
I went out there and built
a product and had no idea
what I was doing,
and I went to a consultant...
We are going to ?? Yes.
...and they destroyed me...
Okay, good to know.
...just like you...
[ Laughter ]
...and could've easily,
you know, pulled up stakes,
but I kept going.
Yep.
And you guys are ??
are still going.
And I love ?? That experience
didn't stop you.
What I want to understand,
I think, more now is,
how do we execute against it?
So, we have, uh,
a distributor in Canada
who has relationships with all
the big?box stores,
and we have online, and that's
what we're ?? that's our goal.
And our marketing plan.
And then we're gonna do
a lot of marketing.
We need money to ??
So, but also
what we're doing
is we're
building a brand.
Money's actually not
the answer, though.
I think you need to understand
how to put the money to work,
or else it's too easy
to get rid of.
Yeah.
Cuban:
Who's your business person?
?We have a few.
?Meaning what?
In the ??
In the team, yeah.
We have advisers
in the business.
Do they own stock?
Yep.
They do. 10%.
Cory, are you ?? are you working
full time on this?
This is my full?time job.
Uh, I drive
for Lyft at night.
So, guys,
I never go to places
where there isn't
24?hour room service,
and the idea of going outside
and being bitten by stuff...
So, I would never use
this product.
?I'm out.
?Okay.
Cuban:
You are passionate entrepreneurs
that love your product,
love everything about
what you're doing,
but you have one
fatal flaw.
It doesn't sound like you're
hard?core business people.
I think it's a difficult
position to invest in.
So, for those reasons, I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Mark.
You guys have ?? You have ??
You have grit.
I?I like the comeback thing
'cause I think it's ??
The best university
you can go to is failure.
I love that you're a Lyft driver
because it shows you're willing
to do what it takes to ??
to provide for your family and
make money, and I?I love that.
Mm?hmm.
I like
the camping sector.
I think there's a lot of growth
that you can do there.
I'd do $100,000 for 25%.
You should say yes
right now.
O'Leary: You should take
that deal so fast.
?Wow.
?Don't even think about it.
Are there any other offers?
Look, the bear's
jumping up and down.
Greiner:
Well, listen, the camping space
is not as much a passion
of mine,
and I think Jamie
relates to it better.
And for that reason, I'm out.
Lori.
Can I speak to that
for a second?
?[ Laughs ]
?You have an offer.
?Just ?? Just ??
?I would really be concerned
about whether or not
that offer disappears.
I have an offer.
O'Leary: Whoa.
of Heidi and Cory's collapsible
cooking pot, Bear Minimum,
but Daymond is also interested.
I deal with a lot
of online retailers
that sell
to the prepper community ??
the people that think that
zombies are gonna attack
or the world's gonna end.
I have an offer for you,
but it's gonna be a little
Sharky, though.
$100,000 for 33%.
I don't know what Jamie
needs behind him,
but I know that I have a lot
of people in this area
that I'm going to have to
probably share percentages with,
but I want them to be able
to get the word out online ??
all these social?media
conversions.
So I have to have
a higher percentage
so I'm able to afford
to bring them to the party.
And let me just tell you, I ??
What I like about this ??
It enables us to go out more,
outdoors.
We need to get
our kids out.
Right. Right.
Yes.
This is like, you know, out ??
out of the screens,
out of all this stuff.
I think this is a great thing
to get a mission behind
and really build.
Is it alright
if we take a minute?
One minute.
