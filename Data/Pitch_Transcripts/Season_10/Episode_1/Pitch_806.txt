Hello, Sharks.
I'm Tripp Phillips.
And I'm Lee Phillips,
his dad.
And this is my sister,
Allee.
We're from Dalton, Georgia,
and our company is Le?Glue.
And we're seeking $80,000
for 15% of our business.
Sharks, I have the solution
to stop those messy breakups.
I'm not talking about
your love life.
Duh.
[ Laughter ]
I'm talking about this.
?No!
?No!
?Oh, no.
You spent all day building
a masterpiece.
That's why I invented Le?Glue,
the world's first
non?permanent adhesive
that just dissolves in water.
Plus it's non?toxic
and safe for kids.
After all, Le?Glue is created
for kids by a kid.
[ Greiner chuckles ]
To use Le?Glue, just apply
a little bit to each brick,
let it sit...
and you're good to go.
So the next time this happens...
...you just pick it
right on up...
[ Laughter ]
...and keep on playing.
And the best part ??
just soak them in water,
and they come apart
like brand?new again.
So, Sharks,
who wants to <i>stick</i> with me
and help me stop those messy
breakups with Le?Glue?
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Alright.
Good job.
We have some samples
and some homemade sharks
that the kids
have made for you.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Thank you, Tripp.
?Thank you, Allee.
?Oh, I like.
I got a great white.
Nice dress.
Thank you.
We got you the whale shark
to match your ego.
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
Nice.
Thank you, Tripp.
You're very wise.
Ba?bam!
?Good job, Tripp.
?Thank you.
Thank you.
So, Tripp, I see you
have a patent there.
?Yes, sir.
?Oh, wow.
What did you patent on this?
Tripp: We have
a utility patent,
and my patent attorney told me
that I was one
of the youngest patent holders
in U. S. history.
?Really?
?Good for you.
?How old are you?
?12.
12.
That's pretty amazing.
I got the patent
when I was 10.
How did you figure this out,
Tripp?
In the third grade
as a class assignment,
I had the option
to write a paper
or come up with an invention,
and I think I chose
to do what any other logical
9?year?old would do ??
avoided the writing.
[ Chuckling ]
So I went home and asked my dad,
"How in the world do I come up
with an invention?!"
He said it was simple ??
just identify a problem and then
find a solution to fix it.
So, that's exactly
what I did.
Spot?on.
As I was in my room,
playing with my airplane
and thinking about,
"What could I do?"
the wing would pop off
whenever I'd do a takeoff.
Then I knew what I should do.
I need something to hold
these bricks together
but not permanently
like superglue does.
Siminoff: So, Tripp,
as the only Shark who's been
on your side of the table,
I have to say,
great job with
your presentation.
Also, as someone who still has a
child that's in this age range,
I have to say this
is a real problem.
My feet, I think, have permanent
marks in them
from stepping on bricks,
so this Le?Glu?? Glue
could be a real lifesaver.
But tell me about the business.
Last year,
we sold $52,000...
?Wow!
?Good for you.
...and this year,
up until the end of May,
we've sold $32,000,
and in our whole lifetime,
we've sold just over $125,000.
Good for you.
?How are you selling it, Tripp?
?Wow.
Mostly online
on our own website.
What do you sell it for?
How much does it cost
to make a package?
It costs 43 cents with direct
labor, but don't tell anybody.
?[ Chuckles ]
?But what do you sell it for?
?What do you sell it for?
?We sell it for $8.99.
?That's a great margin.
?Oh.
?Good margins.
Tripp, why'd you decide to
create a business
out of this, though?
I mean, you could've
just aced the project,
right,
and got a good grade.
Even from a small age, I've
always watched "Shark Tank,"
and as soon as I actually
had a business,
one of the first things ??
probably even the first thing ??
I asked my dad was, "We have
to go on 'Shark Tank'."
?[ Chuckling ]
?That is good.
So, now I'm pretty much
living my dream.
?Oh, that's so great.
?Oh, good.
O'Leary: What is your vision in
terms of getting distribution?
You gonna leave it online, or do
you want to get it into retail
where building blocks
are sold?
His personal goal
is to partner
with one of the brick
manufacturers at some point
to be in every
one of the kits.
Tell you what,
I'm interested in the idea
of approaching
the big block guys.
I know
all the toy companies.
I want to help do something
that you're not doing,
which is get
a license deal.
So, I'd make
a contingency on it.
I'll give you the $80,000.
I'll go make those
calls for you,
but you're gonna
have to come with me
to pitch it to the CEO.
Now, you're gonna have to
put on
a black suit and tie,
just like me.
[ Laughter ]
A tie pin and everything.
That's how
it's gonna work.
You'll look like
a little undertaker.
Well, I have hair, so...
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary:
But the deal's this ??
Whatever I get on the royalty
deal for all of us,
we're gonna go 50/50
until I get my 80K back,
'cause it's gonna be
a tremendous amount of work.
Then it's gonna
drop down to 20%,
and we're gonna have
a partnership in perpetuity
where I'm a 20% shareholder
of the company.
If I don't deliver the big guy,
then I don't have any stake.
We go together, we find out
if they're gonna do it,
they say yes,
we're in business.
Greiner: Wow.
Siminoff: Tripp, Allee,
I think you guys have done
an amazing job with this.
It's ?? It is solving
a real problem.
Um, I think Mr. Wonderful
is actually being wonderful
on this one,
and I think it's a ??
it's a great way to do it.
So, because of that,
I'm out.
Thank you for your time.
John: You know what?
I like this.
I think the licensing route
is great.
I think that
we should try that.
I don't know
as many of the toy companies.
However, I know
the adhesive giant, 3M.
They're doing $30 billion
a year in ?? in adhesives.
So, I'm gonna offer you $80,000
for 25%.
Greiner:
Well, listen, Tripp.
You have two great offers
on the table
where I think either way,
you really can't lose.
So, I'm going out,
but congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Cuban: Guys, I think
it's a great product, too.
I think you have two great
offers on the table
that would be better
than what I can do.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
So, Tripp, you have to
make a decision.
Uh, Daymond, we would like
to make a counteroffer.
Uh, the $80,000 for 20%.
I would like to
stick at the 25%.
I would ?? I would
normally ask 33%.
Are you planning to take him
to retail, as well?
Well, I'm planning to do
whatever you feel is best.
Or licensing. Okay.
Retail may or may not
be in your cards,
but that's something you guys
will decide after you,
you know, decide where
you want to go with it.
And, Mr. O'Leary,
the $80,000 ??
When you're saying, "If you
can't make the deal..."
But I don't get any of your
company unless I deliver
the license deal at ??
one that you want to do.
I'll be taking the same
toy guys, as well.
Greiner: The real difference
is contingency
?on it happening and not.
?Well, also...
It's ?? It's success?based,
though.
It's not a ??
It's not a contingency.
It is. It is.
I don't get anything
if I don't deliver.
But the thing is, with Daymond,
it's firm.
But why give up
25% of your company
if you don't deliver
the whale shark?
That's what I say.
You decide.
Tell me what you want.
Okay.
Mr. O'Leary,
we'd like to do business.
?Oh.
?That's great.
?Alright, Tripp.
?Oh, my gosh.
?Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations. You did really
well on the Tank, you know?
You got two offers.
That's pretty good.
Thank you.
Not easy to
get that done.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much, sir.
?Thanks, guys. Congrats.
?Thank you for your time.
?Congrats.
?Thank you so much.
?Nice job.
?[ Chuckling ]
?Oh.
Great kid, bad judge
of character.
Oh.
Success in the Tank.
Tripp:
Kevin's my favorite because
he doesn't sugarcoat things,
and I'm so excited to work
with him and move forward.
This is definitely
the best day of my life.
It shows you finally get
somebody to like you
if you grovel enough
to a 12?year?old.
[ Laughter ]
We can't be bleeding
the company
out of money
right at the beginning.
So does that mean you're
rejecting him?
Why would I ??
When I invest in a company,
do you think I go against them?
No, absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
But I think that ??
All my companies,
look at all of them.
They've done
phenomenally well.
You want ??
You want somebody ??
You want somebody to be
in there with you for 5%?
Well, so we'd be
interested in, you know,
entertaining offers
at higher percentages, um...
