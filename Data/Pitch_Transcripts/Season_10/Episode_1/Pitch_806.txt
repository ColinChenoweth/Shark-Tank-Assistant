Hi. I'm Brad Ruffkess.
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,
and I'm the CEO
and founder of BoxLock.
I'm here today asking
for $1 million
?for 5% of my company.
?Ohh.
E?commerce sales
are set to skyrocket
past half a trillion dollars
this year.
That means that Americans
are receiving more packages
and home deliveries
than ever before,
but there's a huge problem.
How are we going to protect
all the deliveries
from porch pirates
and package thieves?
Like millions of other people,
I had cameras installed
to be able to keep an eye on all
the deliveries we received.
Literally the very next day,
I watched some guy walk up
and steal two packages
off our front porch.
And so that's why
I created BoxLock.
BoxLock's a smart padlock.
You put it on a storage
container outside of your house.
When your friendly
delivery driver walks up,
he's gonna use the lock
to scan the tracking number
on the package.
If that package is
out for delivery to you,
the lock pops open,
giving him access.
He's gonna put the package
inside, lock it up.
You're gonna get a notification
on your phone, letting you know
that your package has been
delivered securely.
We know it's a win for anybody
who buys anything
and anybody who ships anything,
and that's why we know BoxLock
will be a win for you, too.
I'd love to share some samples
with you...
?Sure.
?Please.
...and answer your questions.
Thank you.
Aww, thank you.
You're such a gentleman.
You're welcome.
?Thanks a lot.
?Thank you.
O'Leary: So, Brad, um,
it wasn't long ago
that someone very much involved
in security
came in here and asked for
a ridiculous valuation.
I was the only Shark
that believed in him,
and now look what happened.
What happened?
He could've made
a lot of money.
?Instead, he made some.
?And now he's working.
[ Laughter ]
You're right
beside me now.
This is ?? looks, feels
really great and solid,
so what have you
put in so far?
Where is the product
at today?
Right now, in ?? in R&amp;D,
we've probably put in, uh,
about half a million dollars.
?Oh!
?Wow.
It is in manufacturing
right now.
Uh, it is in the process
of shipping.
So, you haven't gotten any into
the consumers' hands yet,
but what have been
your sales?
We've actually sold 800 units
on pre?sale.
And what were the units
being sold for?
Uh, the units at that point
were being sold between $89
to I think $109
on Kickstarter.
How much now?
Uh, so, they're gonna
retail for $129.
What's your cost
to make them?
Our next order should be
around $65 per unit.
What are you scanning?
W?We're scanning the tracking
number on the package.
We automatically collect
tracking numbers from UPS,
USPS, FedEx ?? every one
of the carriers.
How long is it gonna take
to make drivers aware
of how to use this device?
So, we're working with
the different carriers
on driver awareness
and training programs.
'Cause if this doesn't
work immediately,
they're gonna put the package
back in front of the door
and move on.
What we found is that
these guys care a lot
about making sure their
deliveries are secured.
So, why don't we just
jump right into
the looming
question here.
You want
$1 million for 5%.
That means you're saying the
company is worth $20 million.
Even the Ring guy
wasn't that aggressive.
[ Laughs ]
What's the reasoning
behind that?
This is a really complicated
problem, right,
and it needs ??
it ?? it needs to be solved.
Just 'cause it's a big problem
doesn't mean you get
a big valuation
for walking in.
W?When Ring came in
at $7 million,
we were at a
$3?plus?million?a?year run rate
of sales of a product.
Yep.
So ?? So, we're in market.
We're actively working
with the carriers, right.
It is all up and ?? and ??
and running.
So I?I want to make
sure I understand.
I have to buy
the box first.
You have to buy a box.
Separately.
?Yeah.
?What's your box cost?
That box is likely gonna retail
between $100 and $129.
But why are you valuing
the business
at that price right now?
We deal in facts, today.
T?That ??
This stuff is all working.
This is ?? It's ??
It's all up and running.
We know all that.
?You've already explained that.
?Don't be ??
?I'm asking about the valuation.
?You ?? You keep explaining ??
Siminoff:
You keep explaining why
the market is worth something.
Yeah, you may see it.
We need to understand why
the business is worth something.
We ?? 'Cause we have
this unique opportunity
to be able to,
as I said, solve a problem
that no one else
has been able to solve.
We ?? We ??
But that's the reason
it's worth $20 million?
What everybody's
really wanting to hear ??
No. We're waiting for real facts
like, "I have this amount of
sales, these amounts of patents.
I have th??" I mean, real facts
that we can take ??
S?So let's talk
about the patents.
You know, I'm just such ?? I'm
just such not?a?patent person.
I had no patents
protecting me.
I out?executed.
I?I think ?? I?I love
the market, by the way.
I mean, I?I literally
sold my company
for over $1 billion
to Amazon,
so I know package delivery.
I control front doors.
I don't like that
you have to change
the user behavior
to do this.
You know, why Ring
worked is because
we didn't have to change
the behavior the customer.
It still was a doorbell.
It still worked.
It just enhanced it.
This changes where
you put the package,
how you deliver the package, the
timing of the package delivery.
And asking for
a $20 million valuation,
you know, it's just ?? it's so
far away from me that I'm out.
Yeah, Brad, there are so many
problems that you have to solve
with so many constituents
that it's gonna cost you
hundreds of millions of dollars
and years in order
to get it done.
There's no path
of least resistance
that gets you to a?a profitable
company that I can see.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
When I've asked you
to explain
the reason why the business
itself costs that much today ??
$20 million ?? you
were not able to explain that
to me in any tangible way.
S?So, with that, I'm out.
Okay.
You know, Brad,
you're climbing Mount Everest
without an oxygen tank.
That million's gonna be
vaporized in three months
in just training costs of all
the millions of delivery guys.
Good luck on that journey.
I'm out.
?Am I the only one left?
?Yes, you are.
?You're the only one left, Lori.
?Ohh, my gosh.
Listen, QVC ships
320 million packages
a year alone.
This is a big problem.
This is a really good solution.
I've been working on something
like this now for several years.
We haven't quite come
to a finalization.
So, I will give you
the million dollars as a loan,
but I want a royalty,
and I want you to
tell me what royalty
you'd be willing
to give me.
Is your expectation
that that ??
that royalty is capped at
a certain amount of sales?
Uh, I would do the royalty
until I make my money back
plus another $500.
Plus another $500,000?
Let me make sure
I get that right.
$1 million plus another $500,000
back in royalties,
so a who?? total of $1.5 million
plus the interest rate?
8% interest and 2.5%
of the company in the end.
Listen, the deal ??
You have learned, grasshopper,
from the master.
[ Laughs ]
I have!
I sit next to Kevin
for many, many, many years.
Cuban: So, anyways...
This is ??
This is a venture?debt deal.
But I'll tell you i??
It's a venture?debt deal.
...you u??
you understand why.
Yep.
I can bring you
the customers,
but there are so many ifs here,
this is like
walking on a tightrope between
200?story buildings.
I mean,
this is really risky.
Uh, well, so,
I greatly appreciate it.
I'd love to see if we can figure
out how to get that loan
up to $1.5 million,
and then I would love to see
the royalty at $3 per unit.
Ichiwawa. Caramba, Lori.
That's a lot of capital.
?Boy, it's like I just...
?Lori, Lori...
?Really worried.
?...come in, Lori.
Really worried. I would've
really ?? They need this.
?What are you gonna do, Lori?
?What are you gonna do, Lori?
?You know...
?So, I'm gonna throw it back
to Jamie right now.
Throw it to Jamie?
Because ?? I am.
I'm gonna throw it to Jamie
because I think he'd be
a great partner.
?Um, I do.
?Whoa.
Jamie, I know there is no one in
this space who spent more time
than me thinking
about this problem
and trying to figure out
how to solve it.
You don't have the part
that everyone's looking for,
which is the network of these
out there in the field
and th?? and that
trajectory.
You don't ??
You don't have that yet.
I think that's ??
that's my problem.
You're missing the part
that I would actually
be wanting to invest in.
So for that,
I ?? I'm still out.
?Good luck with it.
?Good luck, Brad.
?Congrats.
?It's smart.
I hope ?? I hope
it really works out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
?Thanks, Brad.
Ruffkess: I was really,
really, really hoping
that we were gonna be able
to get to a deal with Lori.
Jamie came in here with a big
ask, and he didn't get it.
Look where he stands now.
I look forward to ?? to having
the tables turned
and me sitting ?? be sitting
in his chair someday.
O'Leary:
Jamie, this is all on you.
?You killed that deal.
?Jamie, you were out twice.
?You got to ??
?You killed that deal.
?You got to have ??
?You killed that deal.
?[ Laughs ]
?You know, it's c?? it's cu??
You crushed him.
Kevin, it's customer,
customer, customer.
All he had was product.
You know,
how the tables turn.
Yeah, right?
You pompous ??
You just sat there...
Right.
...and threw that guy out
like we threw you out.
[ Laughter ]
You should be ashamed
of yourself.
?He learned well!
?That's unbelievable.
Boy, people
sure do change.
Greiner: Well, it was a real
flier. It was a real flier.
Jamie, you are
a dream killer.
[ Sighs ]
