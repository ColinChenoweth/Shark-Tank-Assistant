Hello, Sharks.
I'm Sean Bingham.
And I'm Jared Bingham.
We're from Provo, Utah.
And in you hadn't caught on yet,
we're brothers.
We're the founders
of Adventure Hunt,
and we're seeking $150,000 in
exchange for 10% of our company.
Adventure Hunt is a fun
and adventurous
modern?day treasure hunt.
Can you imagine the thrill
of digging up
an actual
buried treasure chest?
Well, that thrilling experience
is exactly what we offer.
Don't just
take our word for it.
Here's a little taste of
the Adventure Hunt experience.
Adventure Hunt sends you off
in teams of two to four people
on the adventure
of a lifetime ??
an exhilarating,
adrenaline?packed ride
we promise
you will never forget.
Hmm.
You'll complete
both gut?bustingly funny
and adventurous challenges
that unlock a real?life treasure
map on our Adventure Hunt app.
From there, you put your mind
and will to the test
as you solve clues
guiding you to the buried booty.
That's right, and it's
a race to the finish
because the first team
to get to the treasure chest
and dig it up
wins insanely epic prizes,
which includes a luxurious trip
to paradise for the whole team.
Now, Sharks, we know
that with Shark mentorship,
expertise, and capital,
we can turn this treasure
of a company
into something Captain Jack
himself would envy.
We want to show you guys
a quick demonstration today.
We brought with us
two past participants.
So, how it works
is on hunt day,
teams receive
a list of challenges.
Some of the challenges
are adventurous,
and some are
just plain funny.
You tackle
each challenge,
taking photos and videos
along the way,
post them to Instagram
for our team to verify
and unlock
the treasure map.
A good example
of an adventurous challenge
might be
the slackline.
So, Addison,
let's see what you got.
All right, Chloe,
let's do this.
Okay.
Gotta find the treasure.
You ready?
?Oh, wow.
?You got this.
Herjavec: Go!
Yes, yes, yes!
[ Cheers and applause ]
All right!
Let's go!
All right!
Yeah!
The fun points are designed
to just make people laugh.
A fan favorite is
the good old?fashioned wedgie.
?A wedgie?
?Greiner: A wedgie?
Assume the position.
Sean,
do you like the offer?
So,
we are very flattered.
We ?? We definitely, out of
respect for the other Sharks
and out of respect
for the business,
I would like to know
if there's anyone else.
I'm simplify, first.
I'm out, guys.
This ??
'Cause of Rugged Maniac.
We do some similar things.
It's not really a fit for us.
?Okay.
?Okay.
?Fair enough. Thank you.
?Well, thank you.
??I'll help you out.
?Tickity?tock.
I'll help you out.
Um, I don't like being around a
lot of people.
[ Laughter ]
Sean and Jared have an offer
on the table from Bethenny
for their experiential
contest company, Adventure Hunt.
But Lori and Robert
may also be interested.
Herjavec: All right.
I love the adventure, but here's
why I'm really excited by it.
I see a huge business
in the, uh, enterprise space,
in the business space ??
large companies
doing team building.
We're doing them all the time.
We're running out of ideas.
I love it.
I love you guys.
$150,000...
for 25%.
?We keep ??
?It's the same thing.
?Yeah.
?So, identical offers, right?
?Yeah.
?Identical but different.
I would use some of the money to
hire some corporate sales folks.
Yeah, that's what
we wanna do, too.
Go ?? Go hard?core
into that area.
Greiner: You know,
I was thinking about your space
and the fact that, you know,
you've already
got all these people
that watch all the shows
that do this kind of thing.
Yep.
And they're like,
"Oh, I wish I could do that,
but I can't get on
that TV show."
So you got them the ability to
do it, which I think is genius.
But I think
the two Sharks at the end
would be
better partners for you.
And so, I'm out.
Sean, $150,000, 20%,
I'll do it.
?15%.
?I won't do it for 15%.
I'll do it for 20%
right now.
We can get you
in the enterprise space.
I'm stuck at 20%.
