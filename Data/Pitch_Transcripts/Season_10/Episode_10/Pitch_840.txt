Hi, Sharks.
My name's Chid Liberty.
And I'm Adam Butlein.
Better known to
his friends as "Booty."
Our company's called
Uniform.
We are today seeking $300,000
for 10% of the business.
To put it simply,
Uniform is an ethical
clothing company.
But our story goes
so much deeper.
See, Uniform is a street wear
brand on a mission.
We're out to re?shape
the fashion industry
with minimalist
hip hop?infused designs
that are 100%
made in Africa.
We have spent years working
with the best producers
in countries like Egypt,
Ghana, and Liberia.
Literally from
dirt to shirt,
we engineer
luxury?quality staples
like our amazingly
soft T?shirts
to our best?selling women's
jumpsuit and bomber jacket.
We provide work for
thousands of working women
in safe factories all throughout
the continent of Africa.
But our mission
goes even deeper,
because with each purchase,
we donate a school uniform
to a student
whose parents could not
otherwise afford one.
You see, all over
the developing world,
kids are required
to wear a uniform
in order to go to school.
So this donated uniform can mean
an entire future for a child.
We call this our
signature +1 program,
because you get amazing clothes,
a child gets a school uniform,
and moms get jobs right
in their local communities.
But let's get
something straight.
Uniform is not a charity.
We are a clothing company
on a mission.
The mission is amazing,
but the clothes are fire.
We brought you
some gifts.
Here you go, Bethenny.
?Thank you so much.
?No, thank you.
Did you get her
the jumpsuit?
[ Laughs ] Well ??
?Thank you.
?I'll have to find out.
Oh, cool.
?Oh, that'll work.
?Yeah.
We thought, perfect for,
uh, sports.
?Yeah!
?Yeah, very thoughtful.
A little working out.
I got it.
Yeah, very thoughtful.
Oh, my God.
I was just thinking,
"What am I gonna wear
at the club tonight?"
[ Laughter ]
?We got you, Robert.
?Yeah, I know.
?Except ?? Except...
?I love it.
?It looks awesome.
?...you gave me a 36?inch waist?
Are you kidding me?
?Yeah.
?I love Bethenny's jacket.
?Yeah.
?No, it's amazing.
?Yeah.
And the coolest thing
about that jacket is
it's actually reversible.
Really?
It was our number?one seller
at Bloomingdales.
It sold out
on our website.
What does this retail for?
$88.
And you can imagine
at Bloomingdales,
it's next to brands
where the bombers are
between $250 and $500.
Tell us your
last year in sales.
Okay. So, we did $400,000
on Kickstarter.
Then last year,
we only did $300,000,
but it's because we
launched at Bloomingdales
for back?to?school,
and then online,
our website launched in,
uh, November.
So we didn't have much year
to generate sales.
Right. Now, what percentage of
those were online, and what ??
what was retail?
Probably about 70% retail,
30% online.
So, what's your history, uh,
you know, before this?
Were you already
in the textile or fashion?
Yeah. We started a company in
2010 called Liberty &amp; Justice,
that was only a manufacturing
company in Africa.
I'm from Liberia.
Sure.
I was interested in providing
jobs, uh, to ??
to women after the war.
Adam is my best friend.
We do everything together.
He's a Jewish boy from
Milwaukee, but he's like,
"Bro, I am coming with you."
We went to Africa.
We established the first
fair?trade certified factory
on the continent.
We ended up getting about
$40 million in annual orders.
?Wow.
?It was a pretty amazing time
for the business...
And?
...as you can imagine.
Um, and then in 2014,
this little thing called
the Ebola Outbreak
happened...
?Ooh.
?...and completely shut down
our company.
Wow.
We went from figuring out how
quickly we could grow
to how to save all
of our workers' lives.
You couldn't go to work.
You couldn't go to school.
So, we're getting
ready to ship,
and the entire town
turns into a ghost town.
And so what happened after
it was all cleared up?
So, nine months later,
we go back on the ground.
Nine months?
It took nine months
to get no new cases
of Ebola in Liberia.
Liberty: When people
think about Liberia,
they think about the civil war
and they think about Ebola.
Now they can talk about Uniform.
Now they can talk about a story
that is so amazingly powerful
and a business that is
literally changing the world.
