Um, all of our customers
are long?gone.
They kind of were like,
"Hey, we gave you guys a shot.
We spent two years building
this thing with you,
You can't up?sell the customer.
That's what
I'm wrestling with.
?Yeah.
?Mm?hmm.
On the flip side, you're giving
jobs to, uh, women in Africa.
I had the honor of going
over to Kenya with, uh,
by spraying it directly
on to those dirty little bottoms
or on to cloth
or dry wipes.
Sharks,
we envision a world
where Pristine is to the butt
as shampoo is to hair...
[ Laughter ]
...where the butt is given
the same respect
as the rest of the human body.
I love you guys.
So, are you Sharks ready
to join the "movement"?
?Oh, my.
?All right.
We want to pass you
samples out, first.
Bring 'em, come on.
So, we recommend
a double?fold.
?Daymond.
?You have a folding technique.
Fold it twice.
?Okay.
?It's an automatic,
no?touch sprayer that can be
used with cloth or dry wipes.
?What do you mean, no?touch?
?So you're saying, like,
the automatic
soap pumps and that,
that you're gonna put
your formula in it.
It automatically sprays,
and then she wipes.
?Precisely.
?So, you're gonna make
a new machine.
No, we know where our
core competency is,
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Daniel Lentz.
This is Tom Zipprian,
and we're here from
San Jose, California
to present Aquapaw.
We're seeking $200,000
of investment in exchange
for 7.5% of our company.
Now, imagine you're
beautiful Claire here.
You go out for a nice hike.
You're running
and stomping and rolling
in everything imaginable.
You get home. You see your
favorite person in the world,
Lentz: I'd like to say
a couple more things.
Lentz: Absolutely.
All right, guys.
Let me start.
I ?? I have a lot of investment
in the pet industry.
We've learned a lot
in the last few years.
Love dogs, but I cannot
get to the $3 million.
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 25%.
That's the level that I see
in terms of the risk
Tom and Daniel have the same
offer from Robert,
?Oh.
?Actually, hang on a sec, Tom.
I'm gonna go get my résumé,
Tom, listen. I'm out.
You didn't include
me in that.
Aww.
I get it.
So, Daniel and Tom, things are
going in the wrong direction.
What would you like to do?
Herjavec: Yeah.
That wasn't a great counter.
I just got to
point that out.
I just don't think
that works at this moment.
Oh, it's so sad.
You had an offer of 25%.
Zipprian: We absolutely wanted
Daymond to be our partner.
But 30%, that's ??
that's just too much.
That's more than we're willing
to part with at this time.
I loved
Bethenny's deal.
I would've ?? I ??
I loved my deal, too.
I'd have done that deal
in a second.
?I would've taken your deal.
?Okay.
Look, to their credit,
they thought their future
had a lot less risk than we did.
