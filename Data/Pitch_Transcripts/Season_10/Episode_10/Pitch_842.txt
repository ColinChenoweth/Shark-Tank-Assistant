Brandon, at the time, was having
his own butt?wiping issues.
I didn't say it!
I said, "Team building"!
You copied me!
He's a copycat!
Hi.
I'm Jessica.
And I'm Brandon.
We live in Dallas,
Texas, and we're...
Cuban: What?
[ Laughter ]
...seeking $50,000...
?Dallas.
?...for 20% of our company.
Sharks, we know something
very personal about
each one of you.
?[ Laughs ]
?Ooh.
You have wiped your butts
with either toilet paper
or wet wipes.
Over the centuries,
we have found very creative ways
to wipe, including stones,
corn cobs,
and even
the "Farmer's Almanac,"
?Mm.
?Today, the multi?billion?dollar
butt?wiping industry
has settled on two options ??
toilet paper
and wet wipes.
But dry toilet paper is not
taking care of business.
And wet wipes don't work
for everyone.
Harsh chemicals and synthetic
fibers in some wipe brands
can irritate the skin.
And I found out the hard way
that some of those
"flushable" wipes
aren't so flushable.
?[ Chuckles ]
?So we created a third option ??
Pristine Cleansing Sprays,
the #1 spray
to wipe your #2 away.
?[ Laughs ]
?For adults and kids,
Pristine is sprayed
directly on to toilet paper
so that it
actually cleanses,
and it's
actually flushable.
Pristine is fantastic
for diaper changing, too,
?And how did you meet Brandon?
?We are first cousins.
?Interestingly...
?Uh?huh.
...Brandon, at the time,
was having his own
butt?wiping issues...
?Ooh.
?Tell us about it, Brandon!
...that I'm sure
he's anxious to tell you about.
That came up at the family
dinner, the Thanksgiving dinner?
You nailed it.
I was a secret wet?wipe user
for my whole life.
And I eventually developed
a skin allergy.
So it was around this time
that I went over
to Jessica's house
at dinner,
and we ??
you know, butts came up.
They ?? They normally do
at our family dinners.
And we realized that
my problem and the problems
that she was having
with her kids could be solved
by one simple solution.
And then, Pristine was
born at that dinner.
Well, I'm curious.
You know, you came in asking
for $50,000 for 20%.
It's not a big number.
Um...
?Not bad.
?...what are your sales?
So, year to date, we have
about $11,000 in sales.
How did you sell the $11,000?
Just curious.
?Amazon.
?Amazon? Okay.
?And, um ??
?How much does it cost
to produce a bottle,
and how much do you sell it for?
We make it for $1.50.
That's expensive.
It's wholesaled
at about $3.50,
and it's retailed for $7.00.
Is there any competition?
Yes. There are other
adult toilet paper sprays,
about 10, that are sold...
10 of them?
?Yes.
?Really?
...that are sold on Amazon.
We have tested and tried them,
and looked at the ingredients.
Red #5, on your rear?
Herjavec:
Jessica, I'm just curious.
Normally, people ask
for too much money.
Why $50,000?
We've valued the company
based on our sales numbers.
?That's fair, yeah.
?And we have something
that we would, um,
like to use that money for.
But our big purpose here is,
we know that we need your help.
Well, what would you
like to use it for?
Yeah.
What is the $50,000 for?
We would like
to introduce something,
uh, that is new to
the diaper?changing world.
Jessica: A potential, uh,
partnership with Squatty Potty
would be beneficial
for both of us.
I really firmly believe that.
They're trying to
help people poop,
and we're trying to clean it.
