Um, all of our customers
are long?gone.
They kind of were like,
"Hey, we gave you guys a shot.
We spent two years building
this thing with you,
and nothing happened."
So we essentially went
back to the factory,
met with the workers.
We had th?? hundreds of
thousands of dollars of fabric
that was just sitting in
a warehouse for nine months.
And we were trying to figure out
what we could do
with this fabric, and it finally
dawned on somebody
that we should make
school uniforms.
MIT did research and proved
that if you give
a child a school uniform,
their attendance
goes up by up to 62%.
And for every three young girls
you give a uniform to,
two will delay
their first pregnancy.
That's major.
And so I just thought,
"My goodness, what if
we could give,
uh, these
uniforms away?"
And I thought, "Huh,
I have seen this model
before where you sell something
and you give something away.
What if we launched
a T?shirt company
that turned into a full?clothing
company to pay for it?"
And that's how
Uniform was born.
What are you
looking for from us?
So, we really are looking
for partners in the business
that help us take it
to the next level.
Next year, we're scheduling
to launch at Target, actually.
It's a huge deal.
So going from 13 stores
to 1,300 stores,
potentially.
?That's committed?
?It's committed.
Just with kids.
We don't have
the purchase orders yet,
but we've having meetings.
Kids ?? Kids' clothing?
Yeah.
Oh.
Just kids.
Listen. It looks like
in all areas,
you are kind of covered, right?
What do you really think that
we can do for you besides money?
Daymond, I don't know anybody
who would want to start
a street wear brand and not be
partners with Daymond John.
Lori, take them on QVC.
I think they would be
absolutely gigantic.
Mark, there's so much that
we can do with the NBA.
Bethenny,
I mean, legendary.
I think there's a million
things that we can do
in terms
of capsule collections.
And, Robert, we've seen what
you've done with other
apparel brands,
um, on the Tank.
So, along that line,
I appreciate that.
?Dude, you're a great sales guy.
?Thank you.
I mean, you're just
bam, bam, bam.
Okay, let me
tell you a story.
So, nine years ago,
somebody came on the show
and they had a T?shirt.
It was a simple T?shirt,
and I was like,
"I love it,
I'm gonna invest in it."
Daymond was at
the other end going,
"He doesn't know
what he's doing."
?Oh, my God.
?And we got into it.
We thought we were gonna
sell everything,
and then it was like
inventory and this,
and we have to buy now
for a season eight months later.
?Sure.
?Blew my mind.
?Yes.
?Great presentation.
Bootie, thanks for being...
Thanks.
...whatever it is you do.
Yeah. I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
Greiner: So, Mark and I
invested in a company
a few years ago called Umano.
They also were in Bloomingdales,
there also was
a lot of T?shirts.
Um, we thought they were cool.
They looked nice.
The fabric was good
and all of that.
But before we could even close
the deal, they went bankrupt.
And Mark and I
looked at each other
and we were like,
"Wow," you know?
?That was fast.
?Yeah.
And what it taught me is
that the clothing business
is really competitive.
It's really tough.
?Yeah.
?So I ??
I don't think it's
the right investment for me.
So I wish you luck, but I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you so much, Lori.
So, I was you when I had
my idea for my cocktail.
And I went to somebody
who had worked
in the liquor business
for years,
because I knew
what I didn't know.
I've always been good
at knowing what I don't know.
You don't want to go with me
because I'm not an expert.
It'll be the blind
leading the deaf.
I'm out.
?So, I'm all in...
?Yeah.
...when it comes
to the mission, right,
because when you lift up outside
the world, the world gets safer.
The world gets better.
Right.
I'll simplify things, guys.
I don't know ?? you know,
everybody says,
"Oh, that's nice."
But I have no clue, right?
I don't think I could ??
I could do anything there,
so I have to say
for those reasons,
I'm out, guys.
All right.
Thank you, Mark.
John: So, guys, I invested in
a company named Bombas.
And for every pair of socks
that they sell,
they donate a pair
to the homeless.
And it taught me a lot.
It taught me that, number one,
they stayed
laser?focused online.
They've given away almost four
million pairs of socks, right?
?Yeah.
?So I value what you're doing.
But it actually made me re?think
my own core business,
because I started to realize
that going into retail
creates a massive
amount of inventory,
you get half the price for it.
You don't even know
who purchased it.
You can't up?sell the customer.
That's what
I'm wrestling with.
?Yeah.
?Mm?hmm.
On the flip side, you're giving
jobs to, uh, women in Africa.
I had the honor of going
over to Kenya with, uh,
President Obama, and, you know,
he made a really great speech
that women at a certain time
weren't able
to even work, right?
Yeah.
And he said
to the whole country,
"How can you ever win a game
if 50% of your players
can't even get on the field?"
?Right.
?Exactly.
I think that's amazing, um,
so I'm ?? I'm torn.
by spraying it directly
on to those dirty little bottoms
or on to cloth
or dry wipes.
Sharks,
we envision a world
where Pristine is to the butt
as shampoo is to hair...
[ Laughter ]
...where the butt is given
the same respect
as the rest of the human body.
I love you guys.
So, are you Sharks ready
to join the "movement"?
?Oh, my.
?All right.
We want to pass you
samples out, first.
Bring 'em, come on.
So, we recommend
a double?fold.
?Daymond.
?You have a folding technique.
Fold it twice.
And about three to five sprays
is wh?? is what we recommend.
?Double?fold?
?Yes.
?You're now free to spray.
?So it doesn't matter.
You could double, triple,
whatever?fold,
as long as it's not
single, right?
Yes.
John: Okay, so tell me the story
of how you came up with this.
So, I'm a mom
of three kids.
At ?? at one point,
that means
I wiped four butts
on a daily basis.
Wow.
And I had a young
daughter in diapers
who was severely irritated
by every brand of wipes.
I had a ?? a son who had
a totally different problem.
He was learning
to use the potty.
I gave him some wet wipes,
but he was flushing them.
?Butt?
?Butt...
he was flushing them.
And my toilet exploded.
My yard was flooded.
?Oh.
?Oh.
?Ow!
?So I gathered all the wipes,
got 'em out of the house.
?Okay.
?It's an automatic,
no?touch sprayer that can be
used with cloth or dry wipes.
?What do you mean, no?touch?
?So you're saying, like,
the automatic
soap pumps and that,
that you're gonna put
your formula in it.
And then when a mom
is changing the diaper,
she just holds
the paper in front.
It automatically sprays,
and then she wipes.
?Precisely.
?So, you're gonna make
a new machine.
No, we know where our
core competency is,
and it's not in
creating a new machine.
We would buy something and sell
it under our Pristine label.
Look, I think
a certain percentage
of people will buy it.
But the challenge for me
is not the product or you guys.
It's the marketing.
You have to convince
people to use it.
Then you have to convince me
of a better product.
I see the marketing challenge
as really almost insurmountable.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you very much for your
input and for you time today.
?Thank you, Robert.
?Guys, I'm a big fanny
of your product.
[ Laughter ]
That's so stupid.
I love it.
Anyways, you know, with
DUDE Wipes, I think
there'd be some ??
some conflict.
And it might make it difficult
for me to work with both.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
?Thank you, Mark.
?Thank you, Mark.
We're disappointed
to hear that, and ??
Frankel: I really like you both.
I think you guys are amazing.
But I think that this looks
like hand sanitizer.
If you're going there,
you got to go all the way.
Calling it "Pristine" ??
It could be a jewelry cleaner,
it could be, you know,
a lot of different things.
I really do like you guys.
I just think you are too early
in the process, and I'm out.
?Thank you, Bethenny.
?Thank you, Bethenny.
John: You know, here's what
I have to say, guys.
There's a lot of competition
in this space,
and it's a sensitive topic
and people don't want to
talk about it.
I'm out.
?Thank you, Daymond.
?Thank you, Daymond.
And then,
there's Lori.
You know, everyone laughed when
I invested in Squatty Potty.
?Yeah.
?Everybody laughed.
Squa?? It's huge.
And, you know,
look what happened.
I mean, we literally
have surpassed $100 million
in retail sales.
?It's amazing.
?Wow.
So I'm sitting here
trying to think to myself,
you know, would you fit
within their arena?
The problem is, is I don't know
if they're already working
on something like this or not.
So if I were to
give you an offer,
it would be contingent on them
wanting to pick up your product.
So, I'll give you
the $50,000 at 25%.
And if Squatty Potty's
already working on this,
then it won't work.
But if they're not,
you got a deal.
So, would it ?? would it be
something that Squatty Potty
sells as Pristine,
or are they ?? with that label?
No. They would bring it
in under their brand.
They would have to.
But let me tell you
something, you guys.
Squatty Potty has done
$100 million in retail sales
in just a few years.
If you have an opportunity to go
with someone that's already big
and can blow up your product,
and you're just brand?new,
why wouldn't you?
We want you
as a full partner,
without
the contingency, but ??
?But the deal is ??
?The deal's with
?the contingency.
?The deal that's offered
is the deal that's offered.
What are you gonna do?
Okay. Lori, we're ??
we're with you.
You got
a contingent deal.
?It will probably happen.
?I hope so.
Listen, there's not a lot of
innovation in the toilet space.
[ Laughter ]
Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Daniel Lentz.
This is Tom Zipprian,
and we're here from
San Jose, California
to present Aquapaw.
We're seeking $200,000
of investment in exchange
for 7.5% of our company.
Now, imagine you're
beautiful Claire here.
You go out for a nice hike.
You're running
and stomping and rolling
in everything imaginable.
You get home. You see your
favorite person in the world,
and they take one look
at you and say, "Whoa!
You're not coming in the house
looking like that.
You're a mess!"
So they grab you by the collar,
take you out back,
and blast you down with
ice?cold water from the hose.
Oh, the betrayal.
No wonder they hate it.
And this is what we do
to our pets every time
we try to bathe them.
Well, we have designed
a revolutionary pet?bathing tool
that not only makes
multitasking easier for you,
but it also makes bath time
easier on your pet.
And it's called
the Aquapaw Bathing Tool.
Our combination sprayer/scrubber
attaches securely to the hand
with a one?size?fits?all
strap.
It's slim and flexible,
giving the use of both hands
to control your dog.
And here's the best part.
You can control the flow
of water with a button
in the palm of your hand.
So, let's see it
in action.
So, first off, notice
how water sprayed
from the tips
of rubber knobs.
And for that reason,
it's injected deep
into the denseness
of fur.
And then once you have
soap on your pet,
it's also a scrubber.
And the Aquapaw integrates
nicely into any household.
Every unit comes
with adaptors
for both the garden hose
and the shower,
making it easier for you
to save time, reduce the mess,
and eliminate the stress
involved with bath time
for both you and your pet.
So, what do you say?
Together: Who wants to
clean up with Aquapaw?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, can we try it
on a real dog?
Together: Absolutely.
[ Laughs ]
So, I've got some samples
for you guys.
And then afterwards,
you're welcome to come up
and try it out.
I've licked a cat
on the show.
I'll bathe a dog.
?Oh.
?[ Laughs ]
?I'll do it.
?Let's do it.
You can take one of each,
if you want.
?Hi, baby.
?This is Claire.
?Aw.
?Hi, Claire.
?Thank you.
?Look at you.
Come on, let's go bathe.
Come on.
You're gonna pull
this strap tight.
?Okay, okay.
?And then you're gonna reach in.
There's gonna be a click,
and then it's gonna turn on.
There you go.
?Is it too cold for her?
?No, that's good.
?Oh.
?Yeah.
?Hi, baby!
Greiner: She's the sweetest dog.
Frankel: And then turn it off
with your hand, Robert.
Let me see how it turns off.
So, press it
all the way down.
?That's pretty cool.
?It's cool.
And then, the shake!
Nice.
There it is.
There it is.
?All right, Claire.
?Here you go, baby.
?Good girl.
?Cute.
It's cool.
It's real easy to use.
Frankel: What are your
retail costs?
How much is it?
$24.99.
?$24.99, okay.
?Wow.
?That's a good price.
?That's cheap.
Yeah. Where are you
selling these now?
Uh, right now we're selling
direct to consumer
through our website,
and then, we also have
a retail partner
called UncommonGoods.
Oh, I know UncommonGoods.
What are selling
to wholesale for?
$12.50.
$12.50, and what does it
cost you to make?
?$5.25.
?$5.25.
?That's good.
?That's good.
How much lower can you get it?
We think easily,
we could get down to $4.50.
?Okay.
?What are your sales?
Uh, in the last year,
we did a Kickstarter.
It was
a successful campaign.
We've been taking preorders
for the past nine months.
And how much
was your goal, and ??
Our campaign was $42,000,
and we hit our goal.
Have you done
any other sales?
Uh, we sold about 200k.
Frankel: Have you
talked to Petco?
We've spoken to Petco.
We've spoken to PetSmart.
We've spoken
to a lot of big guys,
and feedback was great.
I think right now,
they're sort of waiting to see,
'cause we've just
started delivering.
Herjavec: And why is it
worth $3 million?
You're asking $200,000
for 7.5%.
Yeah.
That's a great question.
Um, I mean, up to this point,
200k in sales...
Well, it depends
on the answer.
...200k in sales
in eight months.
That has been with
no advertising at all
and with only one
modestly?sized retailer.
Next year, we're gonna
dump money into advertising.
We're gonna blow up
our Facebook sales.
We're gonna expand,
hopefully pick up
another two
or three retail partners.
John: Why do you have it ??
But, why are you giving us
the valuation of
"hopefully, if everything
goes perfect"?
Uh, you may get to a point
when you manufacture
and get knocked off.
Your ?? you know, your prices
may be compressioned...
?Ah, yes.
?...or ?? and/or diverted.
You mentioned about
it getting knocked off.
We have filed a utility patent.
It's currently under review.
And we've filed a P. C. T.
Lentz: I'd like to say
a couple more things.
I think somebody could see the
brand, they can see the product,
and they can see
the potential to create
a whole ecosystem
of items, right?
Well, okay.
So, expand on the ecosystem.
Yeah.
Well, we have great ??
uh, a lot of great ideas
on how to do it,
but you incorporate
soap dispensation
into the product.
Then also, there's smaller,
low?hanging fruit
like strainers,
tethers, towels.
I have a question. I've seen
things out there that...
?You have?
?Combs, yeah.
...that are scrubbers
with, you know,
water that comes through,
brushes with water.
Okay. So, it ?? they're a lot
of different people
in this category,
but there's no mechanism
where you can actually turn it
on and off with one hand.
I think that's the big...
That is cool.
...the big point
that separates us,
is because you never
have to reach for anything.
So, no one else came out with
an on?off toggle on the hand?
No. No. There's nothing
like this out there.
You know, it's a great lesson.
Sometimes, the simplest remixes.
I always say that, yeah.
How will you get
that message across
in the three seconds somebody
has to look at this?
Frankel: I got it, though.
I usually never get it.
When I sat here,
I got the whole thing.
There's a button in the middle.
And to me, it makes some sense.
Cuban: And they've got
the hand right there.
And you need more dog
on that packaging.
Lentz: Absolutely.
All right, guys.
Let me start.
I ?? I have a lot of investment
in the pet industry.
We've learned a lot
in the last few years.
Love dogs, but I cannot
get to the $3 million.
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 25%.
That's the level that I see
in terms of the risk
in order to get to market and
the work that it's gonna take.
That's the offer from me.
Thanks, Robert.
I really appreciate it.
?Thank you.
?We're gonna consider it.
Okay. So, I feel like this
is a very crowded space.
I kind of like when things are
a little bit more unique.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
?Oh, that's unfortunate.
?Sorry to hear that, Lori.
?Sorry.
?Guys, I'll be brutally candid.
I hate the pet?accessory
business.
There's always an idea.
There's always
somebody else to do it.
I think what you've done
is phenomenal,
but somebody's gonna come up
with something
a little bit better,
somehow, someway.
That's just the nature
of the pet?accessory business.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
?Thanks, Mark.
?Thanks, Mark.
Greiner: You haven't heard
from Daymond, who...
Yeah. We've love to hear
your feedback, Daymond.
...actually is Mr. Petco.
[ Laughs ]
John: Yeah, I'm on the ??
I'm on the board
for the Petco foundation.
And Mark brings up
a good point, you know.
The pet industry is really
a challenging industry
for a couple of reasons.
People are habitual.
They'll spend anything
on their pet.
But, you know, it's getting
them educated
that something like this exists
is extremely, extremely hard.
So to value your company
at that much is ??
it's challenging for me to ??
for me to go help you.
I don't want to insult you,
but I know the amount
of work this is gonna be.
I will give you
the $200,000 for 30%.
Ooh! You're going
the wrong way.
?Well, no.
?You're not shy.
?I'm up.
?Okay.
Uh, okay. I have two dogs,
Biggie and Smalls...
?Aw.
?...that are from
the same litter,
but they're 10 pounds apart.
So I'm a very big dog person.
That was a great story.
And I ?? Thank you, good.
Is there an offer
coming or anything?
So I've been ?? No.
Oh, I'm glad you're ??
I'm here to entertain you.
?Moving on.
?Listen.
Oh, move on?
I listen to you drone on
for hours.
?Right.
?So it's my turn, sunshine.
?Talk to the hand.
?Hi.
When you're about to go
offer them a little money,
you can take a little longer.
$200,000 for 30%, but I will
be involved, you know,
with my face in ??
in the advertising.
And it would be contingent
that Biggie and Smalls
have to be on
the package themselves.
I think we could
accommodate that. Okay.
So, three offers,
that's awesome.
Now that the other
offers are at 30%,
I'm gonna go the other way, too.
Just to make it even.
You didn't
take my offer right away.
?It's all the same offer.
?I'll do the $200,000
at 30%, also.
?Ooh!
So, guys, you have three
offers that are identical.
You can counter.
You can say yes or no.
What would you like to do?
Hmm.
Narrator: Two Sharks are out.
Tom and Daniel have the same
offer from Robert,
Bethenny, and Daymond ??
$200,000 for 30%
of their business, Aquapaw.
Um, I will say the equity
asked is a little high.
Daymond mentioned all
of his Petco experience.
Uh, Bethenny, Robert,
do you guys have any sort of,
uh, connections
with retailers
that you can expedite
this process for us?
?Oh.
?Actually, hang on a sec, Tom.
I'm gonna go get my résumé,
and maybe you can have
a look at it!
Frankel: You could've done
research ahead of time.
What are you talking about?
?You probably want that. ?Yeah.
I mean, I'm in Kroger, Amazon...
?Come on.
?...on Jet, we're all, you know.
Nine seasons, we've sold
a lot of pet stuff.
All right, here's what
I have to say,
and maybe this can help you.
I do have a lot of connections
and experience there.
But to be very honest,
I wouldn't be a spokesperson.
I'd be the back office.
I'd be the one who talks to the
buyers and help you get there.
But if you believe
that you have an offer
by somebody here
who will save you thousands
or maybe millions
of dollars?worth
of advertising and exposure,
and that's what you need,
I'm not gonna be selfish
and tell you that
I'm gonna do that.
I run a pretty big
cybersecurity business.
I have a full?time job.
We're here ??
Oh, now all of a sudden,
I'm some schlepper?
We're here to help you.
Oh, I ?? I ??
No, no, no.
If Bethenny has the time to go
on sales calls with you ??
No, I'm not going
on sales calls!
I'm gonna be the girl washing
the dog in that ?? in that...
She'll take some pictures.
I'm not going on
sales calls.
She wants you to use
her face and image...
?Yeah.
?...on it, which ??
Which is worth a lot of
money, that I will say.
So, guys, we believe
that all of you
offer value
of different sorts.
Um, we'd like to counter
to see if maybe,
Bethenny, with your connections
on social media,
and Daymond, with your
back?office
and Petco experience,
you guys consider joining up.
$200,000 for 20%, so $100,000
for 10% and $100,000 for 10%.
Whoa, dude.
If you're getting th??
If you're getting both of us...
Wow!
...I can't even speak
for Daymond yet,
but if you're getting
both of us, definitely the 30%
is not off the table for me.
?Yeah.
?So, am I wrong?
I thought you were gonna say
that we were gonna get 60%.
?Yeah.
?I mean ??
Tom, listen. I'm out.
You didn't include
me in that.
Aww.
I get it.
And you're the prettiest
one of all of us.
I don't want to be pretty.
I just like being rich, so.
Okay.
I'm out.
Well, I'd like to be both.
Sorry to hear that, Robert.
Thanks, Robert.
So, Daniel and Tom, things are
going in the wrong direction.
What would you like to do?
Herjavec: Yeah.
That wasn't a great counter.
I just got to
point that out.
I just don't think
that works at this moment.
Oh, it's so sad.
You had an offer of 25%.
?Well, you guys...
?And you waited.
...what are you gonna do?
Uh, I think we would ??
we would counter
and say, Daymond, would you
come down to $200,000 for 20%?
Now I'm out.
Sorry to hear that,
Bethenny.
Daymond?
30% is my
final offer, guys.
Wow.
[ Sighs ]
Would you be willing to come
down at all to meet us?
That was my final offer.
Zipprian: We absolutely wanted
Daymond to be our partner.
But 30%, that's ??
that's just too much.
That's more than we're willing
to part with at this time.
I loved
Bethenny's deal.
I would've ?? I ??
I loved my deal, too.
I'd have done that deal
in a second.
?I would've taken your deal.
?Okay.
Look, to their credit,
they thought their future
had a lot less risk than we did.
And they're confident in it.
