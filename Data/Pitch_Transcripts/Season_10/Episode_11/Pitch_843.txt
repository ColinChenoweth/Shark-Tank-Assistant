My name is Whitney Lundeen,
Lundeen: This one is for you,
Barbara...
Corcoran:
Thank you, Whitney.
...'cause you look amazing
in the blue.
Which one?
Corcoran: Oh, thank you.
I love blue.
But, Whitney, I'm always
enamored with numbers.
You know that.
I love numbers.
Yes, I know that.
So, $350,000, 25%,
$1.4 million valuation.
Yeah.
You got to be selling
a lot of this stuff, right?
I've been in business
for five years now.
My first year,
I did $84,000.
Good for you.
$84,000, first year ??
that was five years ago.
?Five years ago.
?Okay.
Lundeen: ...I do ??
I do feel like I need help.
I feel like my margins
are so good,
?So, Whitney.
?Yes, Sara.
I'm in this business.
Yes, you are.
So, Whitney,
I'm gonna offer you, uh,
the $350,000 for 25%.
?Oh, my gosh.
?What?
?Wow.
?Thank you so much.
I would say yes
before someone ??
I'm taking it. I'm taking it.
I'm taking it.

Thank you so much.

Yay!
?Good job.
?Wow.
?All right.
?Congratulations.
?Congrats, Whitney.
?Thank you.
After 10 years
of "Shark Tank,"
you've won the number?one
presentation for fashion.
Thank you, Kevin.
It was such a crazy story.
Crazy story.
Oh, my gosh.
I mean,
it really, really hit me.
But, Whitney, that was
a ridiculous valuation.
A ridiculous valuation.
?Good night!
?Good luck.
Greiner: Bye.
