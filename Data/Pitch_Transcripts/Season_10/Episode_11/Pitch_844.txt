My name is Whitney Lundeen,
and I'm from
Palo Alto, California.
My business is Sonnet James,
and I am seeking $350,000
for 25% equity.
It is so important for parents
to play with their kids,
but too often,
our clothes hold us back
from our parenting adventures.
Well, Sharks,
I'm here to tell you
it doesn't have to be that way
anymore.
I'm the mother of two messy,
wiggly, beautiful boys.
To them, grass stains are just
a sign of a day well?spent.
But on my clothes,
they're an expensive
dry?cleaning bill
just waiting to happen.
I thought,
"What if there was a dress
that made it easy
for moms
to get down
on their kids' level
and immerse themselves
in their adventures
but also made them feel
confident and attractive?"
If you're a mom
tired of yoga pants like I was,
then this is
your new mom uniform.
They feel like pajamas
but will make you look and feel
put together.
You can head to the city
for a work meeting,
take your 2?year?old
on a bike ride,
pick up the boys
from baseball practice,
and go straight to date night
with your husband
without ever having to change.
And the best part ??
when those banana hands
have been wiped clean
on your dress,
just throw it in the wash,
and you're good to go.
Cute.
Help me build a world
where parents are
more young?at?heart,
present in the moment,
and more playful
with the ones they love.
Our kids are still young,
but the days of being invited
on their adventures
are running out.
Thank you so much
for your time,
and I would love to share
some samples with you.
Greiner: Great.
Lundeen: This one is for you,
Barbara...
Corcoran:
Thank you, Whitney.
...'cause you look amazing
in the blue.
Which one?
Corcoran: Oh, thank you.
I love blue.
Lundeen: And for Lori.
And this is for
your lovely wife, Linda.
Thank you.
That's great.
?That one's for you.
?Thank you.
?Appreciate it.
?And then that's for Tiffany.
Thank you.
You gave me a lollipop.
Okay, they're nice and thick
and heavy.
Yes, so they're
flattering, yes.
Durable.
They have that nice little
stretch, but compression.
Also, they don't seem as though
they'll lose their shape at all.
I'm pulling, and that thing
will go right back.
Yeah, they retain their shape
really, really well.
So, what does this cost?
For me to make is $34.
I make locally in California,
and I sell it, on average,
at $138,
and so my margins
are about 75%.
?Wow.
?Wow, that's great.
And where do you
sell it?
I'm direct?to?consumer.
Everything's on ??
Everything's online.
O'Leary:
Everything's online.
On my website.
And by the way,
marketing was great.
You know, the videos ??
Oh, you have a shirt?
No, it's ??
I think it's a dress.
It's a long dress, yeah.
?Oh.
?Yeah, it's my...
Please, I'm gonna wear it later,
Lori.
Leave it alone.
[ Laughs ]
Put it on right now.
But, Whitney, I'm always
enamored with numbers.
You know that.
I love numbers.
Yes, I know that.
So, $350,000, 25%,
$1.4 million valuation.
Yeah.
You got to be selling
a lot of this stuff, right?
I've been in business
for five years now.
My first year,
I did $84,000.
Good for you.
$84,000, first year ??
that was five years ago.
?Five years ago.
?Okay.
And this last year,
I did $1.2 million in sales.
?Whoa!
?Yay!
?That's awesome.
?Wow!
All online.
All online.
?All online.
?How did you get that much?
So you've built
a community of mothers
that are into
what you're doing.
They buy more than one
from you.
Yes, my average order
is two dresses,
so that's around $250.
Wow.
Do they repeat order
from you?
Do they say, "I love it"?
I have a 43%
returning?customer rate.
Your sales are great, so
obviously something's working.
?Yeah.
?But are you making money,
or are you spending
a lot of money on marketing?
?Yeah, so...
?What's your cash situation?
Lundeen: ...I do ??
I do feel like I need help.
I feel like my margins
are so good,
and then I feel like my COG
is good.
COG is
"cost of goods sold."
Yes.
And then my expenses
are closer to, like, 63%,
where my COG's like 27%,
and then I only have
about 8% to 10% left
for my net profit,
which I just feel like
is too small.
Blakely:
You're the designer?
I have designed
every single dress, yes.
And what's
your background?
I had kids young.
I was 22 when I had
my first child,
and I decided to be
a stay?home mom.
And fairly soon after,
I became a single mom.
I was going through
a difficult time in my life,
and so I had this idea
of making a dress
that my mom could have worn
that could've reminded her
to play with me
when I was little.
Then I said, "All right,
this year,
I'm gonna take the idea,
and I'm going to teach myself
how to sew,
and I'm gonna pattern draft,
and every night
I would pretty much
sit on the kitchen floor crying,
trying to teach myself
how to do two things
that I had no idea how to do.
And, uh, I built the website,
and, surprisingly,
a mom blogger picked it up,
and she thought
it was a really cute idea.
And within 48 hours,
I had over 150 orders.
?Wow.
?So cool.
And I completely
freaked out.
And I called my brother.
I said, "I am shutting
the website down.
I'm gonna refund
everyone's order,
'cause I have no idea
how to deliver 150 dresses.
And he said,
"Do not shut it down."
Like, this is what start?ups
dream of, you know?
Greiner:
Yeah. That's right.
And I was like, "Okay."
He talked me down,
and I got in the car
the next day,
and I drove to L. A.
'cause I had heard
that there was fashion?y stuff
in L. A.,
and I just started
knocking on doors,
and the rest is
kind of history.
Good for you.
Can I go back
to one thing on your story?
Yeah.
You said you were gonna
design a dress
that would be like a dress
that if your mother
had played with you?
?Yeah.
?Can you expand on that?
Yeah, so, um, I had
a somewhat difficult childhood.
Um, there was...
Um...
[ Voice breaking ] There was
some abuse and addiction.
And, you know,
it was tough as a kid.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
My parents...
My parents did the best
they could
with what they had,
you know?
[ Normal voice ]
I found when I became a mom,
I couldn't engage with my kids
as much as I wanted to,
and, um, I wanted something
that could help me
be the mother
that I'd always wanted to be
and something that could,
you know, remind me every day
when I put it on
what my priorities were.
And I feel like that's what
mothers connect with, you know?
All of us have come
from some dysfunction, you know?
No one's childhood was perfect.
And I think
this band of us mothers,
we're saying, you know,
we want to do our very best.
And any way I can
support mothers in doing that
is my life goal,
and my mission.
And I feel very honored
that I am able to do what I do.
Greiner: You know what?
How fantastic
that you took adversity...
Blakely: Yeah.
...and you said,
"That's not gonna pull me down.
It's only gonna
rise me up."
Thank you, Lori.
And you did
a fantastic job of it.
You should feel
very proud of yourself.
?Yeah.
?Thank you, I am.
?Absolutely.
?I am very proud.
It's a very moving story,
I got to tell you.
Now, back to numbers.
[ Laughter ]
Let's do it.
I love the numbers.
Blakely: How did I know
that was gonna happen.
No, no, no, no, listen.
I'm moved.
I really am.
I'm moved.
But $1.2 million,
which is spectacular,
I know it's working.
But that 8% to 10%
you're making
means you're basically making
about $100,000.
Are you paying yourself
anything?
$70,000 ?? that's after.
Okay, so that's after
the $70,000.
?Yeah.
?So the challenge here is,
$100,000 on
a $1.4 million valuation...
Is a great,
great valuation.
Not really.
I think I did
a very, very conservative...
It's very fair.
Yeah, yeah.
It's very fair.
...valuation.
Why do you think
it's conservative?
Because I feel like,
I mean,
I believe that my company
can easily be
a hundred?million?dollar
company.
Yeah, but everybody
experiences returns
in the clothing business.
Everybody loses customers.
I mean, what ??
Yes, I have 23% return rate,
which is lower
than the average of 30%.
?Ouch.
?For online...
?That's huge.
?Online, it's not bad.
?So, Whitney.
?Yes, Sara.
I'm in this business.
Yes, you are.
And what I see is
there isn't a huge
point of difference
in what you're offering
from the apparel side.
Okay.
Okay?
There's lots of items
and products like this
all over the market.
Okay.
23% return rate
is a little high
for how democratic of a fit
this is.
Okay.
O'Leary: What does
"democratic fit" mean?
It means it's flexible.
It's a forgiving...
Yeah.
...garment, right?
See, you learn something
every day on "Shark Tank."
But I also like to invest
in female entrepreneurs,
and I just really
like you.
Thank you so much, Sara.
So...
What are you gonna do?
So, Whitney,
I'm gonna offer you, uh,
the $350,000 for 25%.
?Oh, my gosh.
?What?
?Wow.
?Thank you so much.
I would say yes
before someone ??
I'm taking it. I'm taking it.
I'm taking it.
[ Laughter ]
You can't change your mind.
[ Laughs ]
[ Stammers ]
Yes, yes, yes.
You're adorable.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Corcoran: She is adorable.
No doubt.
I'll be able to help you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, it's great.
Yay!
?Good job.
?Wow.
?All right.
?Congratulations.
?Congrats, Whitney.
?Thank you.
After 10 years
of "Shark Tank,"
you've won the number?one
presentation for fashion.
Thank you, Kevin.
It was such a crazy story.
Crazy story.
Oh, my gosh.
I mean,
it really, really hit me.
Give him a sucker,
and something happens.
But, Whitney, that was
a ridiculous valuation.
A ridiculous valuation.
?Good night!
?Good luck.
Greiner: Bye.
[ Both squealing ]
Oh, my gosh!
[ Laughs ]
Five years
of so much hard work,
and it sort of all feels like
it was for this moment.
Whoo!
That was great.
Aww.
It makes me want to cry.
You're as sweet
as she is.
?Ahh!
?Good deal.
Blakely: [ Chuckles ]
