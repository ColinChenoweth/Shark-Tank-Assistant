I'm Meredith Jurica,
Jurica: So, I was sewing these
in my kitchen.
The first 12 weeks I started,
I did over $100,000 in sales,
just me
at my little kitchen table.
[ Applause ]
?Yay.
?Wow.
Greiner: Wow.
Congrats.
Jurica:
So, the lay?flat design,
it has max?capacity storage
while taking up no space
in a travel item,
Meredith, like, okay,
you're doing great.
Yeah.
So, as someone who,
I've owned Spanx for 18 years,
I own 100% of it still.
So, here's the deal.
It's a big decision
to give up equity.
Meredith,
I'll keep it simple.
You're amazing,
but your business is not one
I can relate to.
I'm out.
You know, Meredith...
I was going to say...
I'm out.
?Okay.
?But...
...you changed my mind.
So you know
what time it is?
It's deal time.
Boom, boom.
Let's go. Let's go.
Boom. [ Laughs ]
on Meredith's
cosmetic?bag business,
Makeup Junkie Bags,
but she had
a change of heart.
What changed my mind 100%
was you.
Ah.
You.
Smart idea.
I know ??
Thank you.
I know
we can sell these.
You are such
a can?do person,
that I would love to have you
as a partner.
Thank you, Lori.
So, I'm gonna give you
the $200,000...
Okay.
...as a loan.
I get $1 per bag,
in perpetuity...
but also, something
you didn't know, Meredith,
I am a fashionista.
Really?
In my own bag,
I have a makeup bag
for television.
That's why I look so spectacular
all the time.
I do my own makeup.
I'm gonna use
one of your bags.
But I think it's very expensive
what she's structured there.
No, it's not.
Royalties in perpetuity ??
nasty, nasty.
I would do a deal with you,
a buck?fifty a bag,
but ??
I give you the $200,000 ??
after I get back $750,000,
it goes away,
Corcoran: Meredith, I have
nothing to gain here.
I'm out, right?
Did you come in here
for a loan today,
or did you come in here
for cash?
Um, I came in here for money
of any kind.
[ Laughter ]
So...
I really love you.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my goodness.
Let me tell her
why I structured it this way.
Jurica: It's more than that ??
the contacts, the growth.
By helping you ?? Yes.
?All of that.
?We've heard all that already.
But it's contacts,
it's my show on QVC.
Look, you have
three offers now.
I ??
Now you have to make
a decision, Meredith.
Sara, for the loan,
with no equity in the company,
what can you offer
as far as contacts,
manufacturing help,
getting my name out there,
things like that?
Since you're not getting
any equity back from it,
I would just worry
that it's, like, you know,
"Here's your check,
sweetie.
Don't do that, Meredith,
Meredith.
Greiner: Um...
Damn, that's a ??
Good job, Meredith.
Great presentation.
?Good job.
?Thank you, Lori.
