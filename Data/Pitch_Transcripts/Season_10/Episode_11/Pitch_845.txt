I'm Nikki Linn.
I'm Rusty Niedwick.
We're from Basalt, Colorado,
and we're asking for $200,000
in exchange for
20% of our company,
Kitty Kasas.
That's right, Sharks,
we're just a couple
of tattooed bikers
that have a serious soft ??
soft spot for the kitties.
We were so frustrated
by the lack of
quality pet products.
There had to be something better
out there.
There was nothing.
Something cleanable...
Nope.
...stackable...
Negative.
...durable...
Not even close.
...and so Kitty Kasas
was born.
That's right.
Kitty Kasas are a modular,
stackable cube system
for your cat.
You can use them
individually,
or you can stack up
multiple cubes
in hundreds
of different ways.
And they're super cute
and modern
and come in tons
of different colors.
And they're
virtually indestructible.
So, who wants
to help us...
Both:
Claw our way to the top?
[ Applause ]
?Whoo!
?Well done.
So, let's talk
about Kitty sales.
How much have you sold
of these things?
$600,000.
?Okay.
?Over what period?
?Over what time period?
?Over what period?
Year and a half,
two years.
We had a ?? We had a hiccup
in our second year
when we had partnered
with a plastics company.
There wasn't a lot
of sales.
What about last quarter,
last three months?
Well, last three months,
we're at $200,000.
Oh, good for you.
How'd you guys get
into this?
We've run a no?kill
animal shelter for 20 years.
?Oh, wow.
?Good for you.
And ?? Thank you.
After going through
every product on the market
that was ever made,
there was nothing like this.
We really made it
for ourselves,
and then everyone
who adopted a cat
came in and said,
"Oh, I want to buy one
of those cute little things,"
and then we put them on our
shelter website and sold out.
And then we said,
"Maybe this could be a company."
It just sort of grew
from there.
This was really just a solution
to cleaning the cat rooms.
We can take these outside,
we can put them in bleach,
we can power wash them,
and you just can't do that
with carpet and cardboard.
So, like, I'm a cat lover.
I've had a lot of cats.
[ Gasps ] Yay!
They like it because
it's a little enclosed space.
Like, they're always going
into little tight spaces.
They love it.
It's a whole new scene
for the cats.
And what does it cost you
to make a unit?
We have
three different prices.
The bedroom is about
10 bucks.
The one with the scratching post
is 11 bucks,
and the third one,
the little top bed,
is about five bucks.
Okay, and what do you
sell those for?
$39, $49, and $22.99.
So you should be making ??
you guys are making money, then.
Uh...
This year.
[ Both laugh ]
We've been ??
The first quarter,
if you did $200,000 in sales
mostly direct
with the margins you have...
We're doing mostly ??
mostly direct.
But you said you had problems
in your second year.
Our second year,
we had a very big problem.
We were doing
these rotation?molded cubes,
and we took them
to a design show in Germany.
We had a very large
plastics company approach us ??
they are huge ??
and they basically said,
"We're gonna take
your product,
and we're gonna turn it
into an injection mold.
You're gonna buy
from us.
You can use our distribution
network in the US,
and we'll give you a royalty
for European sales."
They strung us along
for a year,
and then basically stole all
the intellectual property...
At the last ??
So they took it all...
...at the last minute.
...and gave you nothing.
Yes.
We had to walk away
from that deal.
We had to spend
the next year
building our own molds,
redesigning everything.
Wait a minute.
Do you have a patent?
We do.
Why haven't you done
cease and desist?
We have.
We did.
And?
Our choices were,
"You pursue this billion?dollar
European plastics company..."
?Right.
?$2 billion.
I'd like to know what you want
to do with the money.
Um, expand.
It's Nikki and I,
and we have one IT guy.
Okay.
And the big box stores
that we have done,
it's tricky, and the logistics
are very, very difficult.
But ?? But why do you have
to go into big?box stores?
We don't. We absolutely ??
We absolutely don't.
?So, do you need ??
?These margins don't work.
Do you need the money
for support?
Is that where you would deploy
the money?
Additional support and employees
would absolutely be wonderful
to help with expansion
and sales.
That's probably our biggest ??
biggest hurdle at this point.
Corcoran:
And if you weren't gonna go
into the retail space,
how would you use
the money?
Redo the website,
continue to build out
our social media.
I like to invest in people
who are passionate
about what
they get involved in,
and clearly you're
very passionate about cats,
but I am allergic
to cats.
I don't have a cat.
I don't know enough
about this space,
so I wish you guys the best,
but I'm out.
Thank you, Sara.
Thank you.
O'Leary: When I look
at the margins,
you don't make a lot of money
selling to retail.
That's the problem.
No.
I don't like retail
for this.
I don't like
the size of the product.
That's exactly why we went
to that box versus the...
No, I know, but it takes up
a lot of floor space.
But this thing
is very interesting.
On a direct?to?consumer basis,
the numbers work.
Look, I like it.
I'll make you an offer.
in Nikki and Rusty's
cat shelters, Kitty Kasas.
There's two of you.
I want to be the third partner.
I want 33.3%,
and I'll give you $200k,
and I will help you blow this up
direct?to?consumer.
Wow.
And you make a deal
with the cat devil.
?Wow.
?I love cats.
And by the way,
cats love me, too.
I want to know
what the cat lover thinks.
Well, when you go to ship them,
they don't collapse at all.
These do.
These do.
Those do?
Can you show us?
These fit
in this retail box.
Oh, my gosh.
What does it cost, then,
for your shipping and handling?
The shipping and handling
is around $6 or $7.
Lori, what are you doing?
I'm talking.
I'm asking questions.
Well, I'm just saying.
Look, you know,
one of the things
that I start to feel ??
I'm not loved,
and when I don't feel loved ??
You should be used to it,
Kevin.
Kevin, we have to give Lori
a chance.
She loves cats.
?That's right.
?If Lori wants to compete...
That's right.
...bring it forward.
I'm trying to help her
move along.
Corcoran:
While she's debating
whether she's going in
or going out,
I'm gonna drop out
for one reason only ??
I hate cats.
[ Winces ]
When I was very young,
I found a cat in my bed.
I had no idea
how it got there.
[ Laughter ]
That was
the freakiest thing
that ever happened to me,
to have a cat right there.
I can't get over it.
This isn't for me.
I'm out.
Okay, I'm gonna make you
an offer.
O'Leary:
This is really exciting.
[ Laughs ]
This would be
the first time
a cat actually died,
it waited so long.
Okay.
While she's doing that, guys,
my brother loves cats.
My brother posts
947 cat pictures a day.
Can we send your brother
some free samples?
I love your brother!
Yes. But I hate the cat
and pet business.
Brutal business.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Understood.
Lori, while we're still young,
please.
Greiner: Um...
I think that potentially
I could sell this well on QVC,
for one big reason ??
so many pet lovers.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
$200k for 33.3%
just because
he's such a cat hater.
So I'm going to match
exactly what he did.
You're not doing them
any favors.
Lori, would you do 25%?
I would like to be
an equal partner with you.
You want a partner that's gonna
be in the trenches with you.
Absolutely.
Yeah, absolutely.
I feel really good
about the 33.3%
so that we're all
equal partners.
Um ??
She has no creativity.
Linn:
This means everything to us.
Niedwick:
It's incredible.
Three years ago,
this was nothing,
and now we have a deal with Lori
on "Shark Tank."
I'm really heartbroken.
I got to tell you.
You cannot do a deal
with something
where you hate
the animal.
No, I love the animals.
You don't.
You just love money.
[ Laughter ]
