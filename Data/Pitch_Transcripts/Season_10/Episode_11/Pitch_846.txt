I'm Meredith Jurica,
and I am the owner
of Makeup Junkie Bags,
and I'm here today
seeking $200,000
for 15% of my company.
I have created
the most multifunctional bag
a person can own.
You see, I've always been
knee?deep in beauty products,
but storing my obsession
proved to be difficult,
especially when traveling.
I couldn't find what I needed,
so I made myself one.
Mm.
I wanted it to lay
completely flat on a surface,
unlike traditional bags
that dump over,
sending product
all over the counter.
I wanted it to be leak?proof.
I have
a leak?resistant interior,
and I use fabric so beautiful,
you can even double it
as a clutch
for a night out.
Everybody asks me
where I got my bag.
They couldn't find them
anywhere,
so I knew
I had something special.
I put one picture
on social media.
It went viral.
I'd solved a problem
so many people had,
and the bags started flying.
One day, a store called me
and said...
"Do you wholesale?"
Uh...
I frantically searched.
[ Chuckles ]
"What is 'wholesale'?"
[ Laughter ]
"We absolutely do.
How can I help you?"
Same thing when I landed
my first small franchise.
The buyer called and said,
"And we assume
that you barcode."
"Hold, please."
[ Laughter ]
"What is 'barcoding'?
Oh.
Absolutely.
What else do you need?"
I quickly turned
my one?woman sewing show
into a full?blown
"Made in the USA" operation
now carried
by 1,200 stores nationwide.
My only business coaches are
the free sites on the Internet.
I need a mentor, an investor,
which is why I'm here.
So, tell me, guys.
Do I have this deal...
in the bag?
[ Laughter ]
I have samples for you.
Great presentation.
Thank you.
And these are yours
to keep.
Take them home
and stuff them,
and then you'll get
the magic.
There you go.
Can't wait.
What an assortment.
Yes, ma'am.
Lovely. Thank you.
And Lori.
Mix?and?match
of sizes, prints.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Wonderful.
Ah! Wonder bags.
They look more like purses
than bags.
That's very nice.
Sara, hi.
Blakely: Thank you.
?Mark.
?It's like Christmas!
[ Laughs ]
Jurica: So, I was sewing these
in my kitchen.
The first 12 weeks I started,
I did over $100,000 in sales,
just me
at my little kitchen table.
[ Applause ]
?Yay.
?Wow.
Greiner: Wow.
Congrats.
Jurica:
So, the lay?flat design,
it has max?capacity storage
while taking up no space
in a travel item,
and then I have a men's line
called Man Junk.
[ Laughs ]
Man Junk!
Yeah.
So what are your sales
right now?
I'm about 18 months old,
and I'm at
about $1.15 million.
?Good for you.
?Whoa!
It's about time we got somebody
who knows how to sell on here.
Thank you.
You deserve
an "Ay, Chihuahua! Caramba!"
Thank you.
That's unbelievable.
I make these in?house.
I tried out a small manufacturer
who had horrible quality,
crooked zippers,
and I'm like,
"I can't sell this."
I'm a details person.
Every detail matters.
And he was very rude to me,
and he said,
"The only way to control
your quality
is to manufacture yourself."
And I said, "Sir, yes, sir."
I bought industrial equipment
with all of my profits,
hired seamstresses,
and we make over 6,000 bags
a month now
in Houston in my building.
Wow.
This is a three?clap
presentation so far.
That's a first.
O'Leary: Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
So, what does it cost you
to make this one and this one?
Okay,
so it's the medium one.
The black and pink in your
hand's gonna be about $6.75.
Wow.
The large one's gonna be
closer to $7.50
just for the extra fabric.
?And what do you sell this for?
?And what do you sell it for?
We're 90% wholesale,
and so that bag
wholesales for $24,
and it retails for $50.
You have great margins.
Thank you.
Do you own 100% of the company
right now?
I do.
We're a debt?free company.
I had my little nest?egg
that my sweet husband gave me.
It was actually a down payment
he was gonna get
a new truck for,
and he was like, "You really
think you can sell these bags?"
And I'm like, "Look at
how many orders I got, honey."
[ Chuckles ]
Three months later,
he got a new job in Houston ??
he's in the oil field ??
and they gave him this, like,
decked?out,
brand?new sales truck.
That's karma.
And I was like,
"Holy, guacamole, wow."
[ Laughter ]
Meredith, like, okay,
you're doing great.
Yeah.
So, as someone who,
I've owned Spanx for 18 years,
I own 100% of it still.
So, here's the deal.
It's a big decision
to give up equity.
It is, and I thought about it
long and hard.
I want to increase
my production,
whether it's in the USA,
whether it's overseas,
because, today, if
a big?box store walked up to me,
and they were like,
"Oh, we love it.
We love it.
Let us have it."
I would say, "You can have it.
I can't make it."
[ Laughs ] Because I can make
about 6,000 a month,
and we sell out all the time.
But so many
in the fashion space,
over the decade
of "Shark Tank"
have heard that call
to go into big box,
to go into retail...
Yeah.
...only to be slaughtered
later.
Are you hell?bent
in going into retail?
Right now, because that's what
the bread and butter
comes from, it is, so...
Yeah, but I'm not talking
about these boutiques
that are paying you, I bet,
pretty quickly.
Mm?hmm.
I'm talking
about the big boxes.
Yeah.
They eat people like you
like a snack.
So, on top of trying
to get the big fish,
I also want
brand awareness.
I want women to understand
how wonderful these are.
I've talked to all these
PR companies who say,
"Girl, we can get your product
floating into the universe.
I just need a $5,000 a month
retainer, is all I need."
Well, I can't sink
that much cash in
when I'm a cash?based business.
?Wait, wait, wait.
How many words a minute
do you talk?
[ Laughter ]
Well, Barbara, I don't have
the data on that right now.
[ Laughter ]
You know what I think?
What you're doing
is thinking
that "short on cash"
is a liability.
It's not.
It's a great asset.
I remember
as a young businesswoman
never having near the money
to match my dreams,
but it was because I had
to spend every penny so wisely
that made me secure
in my footing,
and made me grow
a big business.
I would suggest
you maybe look at yourself
as having
the whole shooting match.
?Ch?ch.
?We don't see entrepreneurs
that are as phenomenal
as you are...
Thank you. Thank you.
...with a great product.
So, I would be unconscionable
going in with you,
'cause I don't think
you need anybody,
so I'm out.
So, what I'm hearing you say
is your biggest challenge
is being able
to provide the product.
Your demand is greater
than your ability to make it.
Yes.
So I would spend
all of your time
solving that problem.
I'm not gonna offer you,
because I want you to keep
your business,
so I'm out.
What's going on in all those
heads over there, you guys?
[ Laughter ]
Meredith,
I'll keep it simple.
You're amazing,
but your business is not one
I can relate to.
I'm out.
You know, Meredith...
I was going to say...
I'm out.
?Okay.
?But...
...you changed my mind.
So you know
what time it is?
It's deal time.
Boom, boom.
Let's go. Let's go.
Boom. [ Laughs ]
on Meredith's
cosmetic?bag business,
Makeup Junkie Bags,
but she had
a change of heart.
What changed my mind 100%
was you.
Ah.
You.
Smart idea.
I know ??
Thank you.
I know
we can sell these.
You are such
a can?do person,
that I would love to have you
as a partner.
Thank you, Lori.
So, I'm gonna give you
the $200,000...
Okay.
...as a loan.
I get $1 per bag,
in perpetuity...
Ooh.
...and just 5%
of the company.
So, one second.
Before we go anywhere,
I want to help you squeeze
Lori's head a little bit,
because, you know,
I am the king of royalties,
but also, something
you didn't know, Meredith,
I am a fashionista.
Really?
In my own bag,
I have a makeup bag
for television.
That's why I look so spectacular
all the time.
I do my own makeup.
I'm gonna use
one of your bags.
But I think it's very expensive
what she's structured there.
No, it's not.
Royalties in perpetuity ??
nasty, nasty.
I would do a deal with you,
a buck?fifty a bag,
but ??
I give you the $200,000 ??
after I get back $750,000,
it goes away,
and all I want of the business
is 3%.
So, that way ??
5%, 3% ??
No, the point is...
He wants to $700,000...
...you have a royalty forever
there.
...and he's not helping you
manufacture...
You should push back
saying...
...or do anything.
...after she's got a decent
return on her capital ??
Corcoran: Meredith, I have
nothing to gain here.
I'm out, right?
Did you come in here
for a loan today,
or did you come in here
for cash?
Um, I came in here for money
of any kind.
[ Laughter ]
So...
I really love you.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my goodness.
Let me tell her
why I structured it this way.
I'll come in,
and I'll be able to give you
all of
my manufacturing resources,
help you with design.
I make bags already,
so I'm like
the perfect partner
to help you manufacture
overseas,
bring it in,
and do all of that.
O'Leary: How do you know Lori's
gonna care about your bag
more than
her other bags?
I don't have a bag company
in my portfolio.
Because I care about
all my entrepreneurs
more than me.
I ??
You would be my only bag.
Blakely: Oh, my God.
Are you charging interest
on your loan?
5%,
'cause I want to squeeze
his head a little bit more.
So let's ??
Now you understand that offer.
I'm only asking for 3% equity
in the company.
Those are the two offers.
What do you want to do?
Blakely: So, I'm gonna jump back
in here for a second.
The problem ??
?Uh?oh.
?Because...
I don't want you
to give up any equity.
So, I would loan you
$200,000.
I would want
a dollar a bag back
until the loan is repaid.
So, this is coo?coo.
You know
it's not just a loan.
It's everything
that I bring to the table.
Jurica: It's more than that ??
the contacts, the growth.
By helping you ?? Yes.
?All of that.
?We've heard all that already.
But it's contacts,
it's my show on QVC.
Look, you have
three offers now.
You understand them?
I do understand
each of them.
I ??
Now you have to make
a decision, Meredith.
Sara, for the loan,
with no equity in the company,
what can you offer
as far as contacts,
manufacturing help,
getting my name out there,
things like that?
Since you're not getting
any equity back from it,
I would just worry
that it's, like, you know,
"Here's your check,
sweetie.
Now get your little butt
on out there and do it."
You know what I mean?
Like...
Blakely: In this deal
and what I offered,
if you're wanting a lot
of my time and energy on this,
it won't be to the degree that
Lori would be able to offer.
I'm just throwing something
in the mix
to make you really think
long and hard
on do you want
to give up equity.
Lori, would you do 75 cents
a bag since it's forever?
Don't do that, Meredith,
Meredith.
Greiner: Um...
Damn, that's a ??
Good job, Meredith.
Great presentation.
?Good job.
?Thank you, Lori.
