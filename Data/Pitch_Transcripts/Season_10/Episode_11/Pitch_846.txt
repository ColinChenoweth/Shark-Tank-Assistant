Hello, Sharks.
My name is Iskra.
I'm originally from Bulgaria,
and now I live in San Diego.
Hello, my name is Brian,
and I'm the man
behind this woman.
?[ Laughs ]
?We are seeking $300,000
in exchange
for 10% of our company.
Angel Shave Club.
Shave clubs are great.
They offer quality razors
delivered to your door
at prices
way less than retail,
but why do they only cater to me
and not my wife?
Why do my pretty pink razors
cost more?
Because of a little something
called the pink tax.
The pink tax refers
to the extra amount of money
that women are charged
for essentially
the same products that men use.
Women's personal?care products,
including razors,
cost 13% more
than a man's.
That is just wrong.
[ Laughs ]
I like being a woman.
I just don't like
being charged for it.
I was a shave?club member
for years,
and I used to buy extra
men's razors for Iskra
because they were
so much cheaper,
but, because they were
almost identical,
she would grab mine
by mistake.
I had an epiphany.
And, just like
any brilliant idea,
the concept of our company
was born in the shower.
[ Laughter ]
Angel Shave Club ??
a shave club for women.
We're fighting the pink tax
one shave at a time,
making it so every woman
can be her own guardian angel.
Sharks, you're going
to love our razors
and our shaving products.
We have samples
for everyone.
[ Laughter ]
Now, what we have here is
our flagship product,
our box that our customers get
when they first order.
We send out
subscription razors
bimonthly
and every four months,
depending on the frequency
that they choose
when they first sign up.
They can choose a quantity
of six razors or eight.
So, answer me this.
I look at this,
and, other than the pink handle,
it's the same thing.
Why not just use
a man's shaver?
Because we like pink,
and we want our razors
to reflect the personalities
of our customers.
I had a razor like his,
and I couldn't tell them
apart.
Put a little pink sticker
on one,
no sticker on the other.
And not only that...
Would you say the cost
is the same, though?
The cost is exactly
the same.
Like, if it's yours,
but it's pretty pink,
and it just feels
more feminine.
Exactly.
But apples to apples,
it's equal?
Actually, our razors
are really, really good.
I don't know, ladies,
if you shave at night,
the next day you're already
kind of stubbly.
With our razors,
actually,
you're just
as if you just shaved.
What would keep the people,
the big players in this space,
from just coming out
with a pink razor?
Nothing,
and we welcome
all competition,
however, they are still
man?owned
and man?run companies.
We are the first shave club
that's started by women
with women in mind.
Do you have
any customers now?
We've been a business
for two years.
We have close
to 9,000 customers.
Those 9,000 have been,
on average,
how long with you?
Four to six
billing cycles.
What's your turn?
How many have fallen off,
stopped using you?
For a long time?
We have
a turn rate of ??
it's 10% to 12% monthly.
Tsenkova: Every month.
And the number?one reason
is because
people have
too many blades,
and they eventually quit,
but we're actually
rebuilding the site
to include
a better pause feature.
So, wait. How many blades
do you get in a month?
We send a box
of six or eight.
And it's expected
to last how long?
I'm just curious.
That's two months...
This is two months.
...or four months,
depending on the woman.
Did you ever tell us
what it costs?
It's $18 either every two months
or every four months.
There's another issue,
is there not?
The stubble on a man's chin
is extremely tough on steel.
It dulls it very quickly.
Not so
with women's leg hair.
You haven't met
my legs.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you, Barbara.
But they get three times
more usage
out of one blade.
Is that true?
We might not shave
as often,
however, we have a larger
square?footage to cover,
so, ideally, a woman would have
to change her blade ??
Yeah, but you've been
doing this a while now.
You literally turn over
your entire subscription base
every eight
to ten months.
There's either too many blades,
or something else is wrong.
What does it cost you
to make it?
So, the flagship box
where you get razors
and a handle,
and then the repeats
plus the shipping,
it's gonna be $10.
That's not a lot
of gross dollars,
and it's expensive.
But that being said,
our first nine months,
we did $74,000 in sales.
Last year, we closed
at just over $390,000.
This year ??
So, you've built, like,
a very nice business
for yourself.
Yeah.
O'Leary: But you're not making
any money.
You're not making any money,
are you?
We're reinvesting absolutely
everything that comes in.
We would actually be able
to fund for the whole year,
but the problem is
our supply chain
currently right now
is 90?day lead times.
That's the reason
why we can't take profits,
because we have to put every
single dollar we have into...
And then some.
Guys, the challenge,
as you know,
is, in terms of cash,
it takes a lot of cash,
because, at 10 bucks a month,
9,000 subscribers,
$90,000 a month,
you're gonna have
to spend 10x of that
just to acquire enough customers
to really be successful.
Actually,
our customer acquisition cost
is not that high.
It's not so much
the customer?acquisition cost.
It's that
you turn so much.
We are putting practices
in place
to actually reduce
that turn rate,
because we think that
by putting
a pause feature in,
maybe we'll even
allow women to,
instead of two months
or four months,
we'll even do
a six?month option.
Okay, why are you worth
$3 million?
We're on track to do about
$700,000 this year in sales.
We're already at $220,000
as of today.
So we're actually almost double
what we did last year.
Even if you hit
the $700k?mark,
which would be great
in just the top?line growth,
you still won't be
making any money.
But this is
the type of business
you can do
ridiculous numbers.
It's not like
we're gonna sell 1,000 units
and make a huge profit.
We're gonna sell 100,000 units
and make a profit.
So, I like
subscription boxes,
to receive them.
I think it's fun.
But usually there's, like,
a bit of a surprise inside.
Here, it's the same thing
that I'm getting all the time.
Yeah, you got to shave.
That's the idea.
Well, no, I get
that you've got to shave,
but I want every month
to be something different,
and that's not what
you're all about.
You're all about replenishment
and shaving.
I don't feel like it's good
for me to be a partner
when I want to change
what you're doing,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
So, I ??
Thank you so much, Lori.
However, I will try
and bring you back in.
