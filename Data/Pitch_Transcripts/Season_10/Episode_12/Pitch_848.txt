My name is Brice Baillie,
and I'm the founder
of Obvious Wines.
I'm asking for $150,000
in exchange
of 5% of my company.
Yes, you noticed an accent.
I'm originally from
the Champagne region in France,
and I've been living
in Los Angeles
for about
three years and a half.
And I'm here
to talk about wine.
Now, you might be thinking,
"Oh, no, another wine snob
who's only here
to seduce Mr. Wonderful
and will use fancy words
to talk about wine."
Something like,
"Oh, Château Bling?Bling, hmm.
[ Laughs ]
I love this wine.
Such amazing
Japanese oak notes
and with some hints
of smoked bacon."
[ Speaking French ]
Well, thank you.
It's ??
It's actually the opposite.
Drinking wine is easy, right?
Casual and fun.
Cheers.
And so should be
the way we talk about it
and how we pick it
in a store or in a restaurant,
which is why
I created Obvious Wines.
Obvious Wine
is a curated collection of wines
sold directly
from eco?friendly vineyards
from all over the world
and created in partnership
with passionate wine makers.
Our wines are packaged
with simple, straightforward,
and educational labels.
Let me show you.
The front label simply talks
about the taste of the wine.
The back label gives you
additional information
about where it's from,
the food pairing,
and the tasting notes
for more advanced consumers.
Ultimately, you know exactly
what to get from our wines,
and you don't need a PhD
to drink them.
So, who wants to taste
some snob?free wines?
?Right here, man.
?Let's try it.
?Bring it.
?Let's try.
?Yeah.
?Snob?free wines.
?Here we go.
?Oh, hey.
?Here we go.
?Yeah.
Merci, Brice.
Oh, two.
Oh, très bien.
It smells really nice.
?Really nice.
?Mm?hmm.
Merci.
Brice,
what's your history?
So, I didn't study wine at all.
I studied business.
And then I started to work
in finance for L'Oréal,
which is
what brought me to the U. S.
I?I've quit seven month ago
as soon as I got
the distribution licenses.
A week later, I resigned,
and that's...
How ?? How did
you go from L'Oréal
to starting this business?
I started to be
really an enthusiast
about American wines
and California wines,
but I?I was lost.
And then I realized
that most people around me,
they were not only lost,
but also very intimidated.
Greiner: Oh.
So, in my head, I was like,
"How can we help people
with straightforward labels,
however, to keep very high
quality, as you tasted?"
Why did you decide to give up
your day job to do this?
So, I did a pilot last year
for a few month,
and all of the stores
we sold to,
they purchased again,
and they sold out.
So I?I?I know that it sells.
Cuban: They just saw
the labels, and they thought,
"Okay, this is interesting.
Now I know
what I'm talking about"?
Yeah. Yeah.
And there was, like,
a real, like, appetite,
and, again, the ??
the ?? the label is important,
but what's in the bottle
is also very important.
Herjavec: What does
it cost you to import?
What does this cost
landed?
So, retail is $16.
Okay.
But we sell to retailer
for about $11.
Where are you selling them?
And how much
have you sold?
Right now, we sell them
only in Southern California.
I started in February,
so seven month ago.
So, are you going
through a distributor
or selling direct to retail?
We also distribute it.
So I have the importation
and distribution licenses.
We are sold about ??
in more than 100 locations.
We just passed the bar
of $100,000 wholesale.
In ?? In wholesale?
In wholesale,
which is, like, 9,000 bottles.
So, Brice, you're simplifying
the process of buying wine.
Correct.
You're making it less snobby.
Correct.
Why don't you have
a label like this?
Because I don't
need to do that.
My name, Kevin O'Leary,
is a brand.
People trust me
in the wine business,
and I sell a lot of wine.
So, Brice,
he's not your customer.
But ??
And because ??
And because he thought of it.
No, no, no, but ??
but the market, it's a ??
No, he's ??
he's the anti?customer.
?Right.
?He's the wine snob.
?He ?? He is the wine snob.
?Yeah.
Right? He's the whole reason
you created this brand.
Baillie: So...
But I ?? No, I'm not against
what you're doing.
Cuban:
He's trying to take all ??
Kevin, what's the fancy word
you used from previous?
?The Chevrolet Tastevin.
?No, no, no, no.
?Chevaliers du Tastevin.
?The Chevaliers du Tastevin.
?Yay!
?Wow, you said it properly.
Brice,
is that a real thing?
?Yay!
?Yay!
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
[ Laughter ]
Well, Kevin,
I brought you a tastevin
so you can taste it with it,
actually.
?Yes, of course.
?Oh!
?So it does exist.
?The brotherhood.
?It does. It's a real thing.
?Wait. Kevin.
?It's ?? It's from Burgundy.
?Notice how I hold the tastevin.
You'd want to take some
out of the barrel,
put it into the tastevin...
?Mm?hmm.
...let the air hit it,
'cause it has a large surface.
?Mm.
?[ Sniffs ]
Smell it thusly.
A small sip,
and discard the rest.
?Huh. And what are you called?
?Why?
O'Leary: And then say,
"Chevaliers du Tastevin."
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
Together: Yay!
O'Leary:
That's how it works.
I kind of knew
that would happen, but it's...
?Okay. Back to your story now.
?Okay, your turn.
How do you make it bigger?
Like, how do you get it
to larger?scale retailers?
Is that the plan?
So, the way you do that
is showing a success story,
which is what I'm doing right
now in Southern California.
And the way you're gonna do
that is hire salespeople,
have those relationships,
get them out there.
Yeah.
And then it's going and
just contacting those people,
and I actually want to hire
someone who's done that.
Yeah, but, you know, a lot
of times, we joke with Kevin,
but I've seen him work,
you know,
from the beginning
with this.
One day, he called me.
He said, "Hey, I'm at Costco.
I'm doing a tasting
for my wine."
I go over to Costco.
There's a line snaking outside
of Costco around the block.
They have him
chained to a table.
The Costco people
are beating him.
And he has a cheese tray
in one hand.
He was there
for 17 days.
I have a feeling
you're gonna experience that
before this is over.
Building a brand
is extremely difficult.
I'm out.
Thank you, thank you.
I obviously can't do this deal.
I'm competing with myself
if I do.
This year, I'm gonna break
$10 million in wine sales.
That puts me in the top 5%
of guys that make wine.
Really?
Yep.
That's how tough
a business it is.
?I believe it.
?Good luck, my friend.
?Thank you.
?Chevaliers du Tastevin.
Together:
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
?Merci.
?Hey!
?But I'm out.
?Thank you.
Cuban: I have a rule.
I do not invest
in any "Shark Tank" companies
that bring out a mime.
For that reason, I'm out.
?[ Laughs ]
?You don't like the mimes?
Nobody likes mimes
except the mimes.
Yeah.
The mime scared me.
Greiner:
So, great job.
I like the whole concept of it,
and it tastes great.
I also think women are
the biggest wine drinkers.
And ?? And I think, also,
women don't ??
don't try to be snobby
about wine.
They know what they want.
They know what they like.
They don't ??
?Lori, is there an offer coming?
They don't care. Women
just want their glass of wine
at the end of the day.
And they want something good,
and...
And they want something good.
Yeah.
So I'm gonna make you
an offer.
in Brice's no?nonsense
wine company, Obvious Wines.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
?Hang on. Hang on, Lori.
?I'm joining ??
Hang on. Hang on.
Brice,
have a glass of wine.
?Oh.
?Thank you.
?To the...
?Except that ??
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
You took all my wine!
Together: Yay!
?Cheers.
?Yay!
[ Chuckles ]
?Thank you, Robert.
You're just starting,
right?
So I'm willing to take the
journey with you, hand in hand.
I'm gonna offer you
the $150,000,
but I'm gonna ask for...
Come on, Brice.
Okay. Okay.
Done?
Deal. Deal.
?Cool.
?Chevrolet Tastevin!
?Yay!
?Yay!
?Yay!
?Well done.
?What a deal.
?Can't believe it.
[ Laughs ]
Wow. Thank you.
You are welcome.
Thank you. Yeah, thank you.
And Kevin
has a competitor now.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Congratulations, Brice.
Congratulations.
And please enjoy the wine.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
?Thank you for the wine.
?Cheers.
?Cheers.
?Salute.
?Salute.
?Cheers.
Okay, one last
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
Yeah.
Together:
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
Yay!
Baillie:
Having Lori on board is gonna be
a huge step for Obvious Wines.
I think, through her past
businesses and her contacts,
she can help talk
directly to big buyers
and get the product
in front of them.
Together:
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
?Yay!
?10 years of "Shark Tank"!
?10 years of "Shark Tank"!
?Yeah!
