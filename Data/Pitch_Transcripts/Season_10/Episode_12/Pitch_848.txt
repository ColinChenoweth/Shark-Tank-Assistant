My name is Juls Bindi
from Austin, Texas.
?What?
?All right.
And I'm Carolyn Shewfelt
from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,
and these are
our spokespooches,
Bentley and ZuGo.
We are looking for $100,000
for 10% of ZuGoPets.
We are revolutionizing
the way pets travel.
As dog owners, we love to take
our dogs everywhere with us.
But having your dog
sit in your lap,
loose in the back seat, or in
an unsecure carrier or crate
can be dangerous
in an accident.
In this crash test,
these are products
that have failed
on the market
in the crash?test
simulation.
Thank goodness
those are fake dogs.
Bindi: There's Velcro
in the back of the harness,
which helps hold
the dog in place
while he does
the tummy strap.
You free the tail. You pull up
on the center buckle.
[ Laughter ]
You secure the shoulders.
And drugs were not involved?
?No.
?He's fine. Look at him.
O'Leary: How can he possibly
be happy like that?
Well, it beats
the alternative.
What are you talking about?
Dogs like to stick their
head out the window.
You adjust the straps,
and he's in.
So, you guys
are probably thinking,
"Why is he suspended a couple
inches above the seat?"
which is ideal positioning
to protect the spine.
Bentley is comfortable, but,
most importantly, he's safe.
?Is he scared in there?
?He's just really nervous.
Herjavec: You know
what it's like pitching.
[ Chuckles ]
This is the exact same test
that you just saw those other
products fail miserably in.
This is our product,
The Rocketeer Pack,
passing with perfect scores.
But that's not all.
The Rocketeer Pack
comes with front
and backpack attachments,
so when you reach your
destination, you and your pooch
can navigate
those busy streets together.
Ah. Now, I like that, too.
I like the other application.
?It's like a baby carrier.
That's a great idea.
There must be other products
that do this, right?
No. This is one of a kind.
We have a patent.
You mean nobody else
has a ?? has ??
Greiner: For a seatbelt
for a dog?
I've seen people strapping
on dogs on ?? on bikes.
Shewfelt: Oh, yeah, they do,
but they're not crash?tested,
and they're
not safety?approved.
How much does it cost?
It costs $160.
?Ohh!
?Oh.
?What?
?That's expensive.
?Hmm.
?And what's it cost you to make?
Greiner: Is that because
you're making it here?
It costs us $36 to make.
Oh!
That's a huge margin.
?Mm?hmm.
?So, what are your sales?
Right now,
our sales is $180,000,
and we just launched it
in November.
Where are you selling them,
then?
We're selling only
on our website.
So, how are
you driving traffic, then?
It's all organic
and word?of?mouth.
Wow.
How did you come up
with this?
I actually developed this and
hold the utility patent on it.
The reason
why I started this
is because I have a dog
who has hip and knee injuries,
so I wanted to be able to
travel with them safely.
Wow.
And I couldn't find
anything on the market.
I actually licensed
The Rocketeer Pack off of her.
I really believe
in her project.
So, how much money did you put
into Carolyn's business?
?How much money?
?Well, all together,
I put in $200,000.
?Whoa.
?Wow.
?Yeah.
What did you
put the money into?
We went into crash tests
and production.
So far, we have
$200,000 worth of inventory.
Who does the day?in, day?out
running of the business?
I do.
What does Carolyn do?
She does all the fulfillment
in her garage.
?Really?
?Carolyn, do you know
what the data is
in terms of number of dogs
killed per year
in car accidents?
I don't know that number.
I do know that,
in the United Kingdom,
if you are in an accident
and your dog is unsecured,
it voids your ??
your auto insurance.
Really?
So they are actually putting
those laws into place.
So then ??
then the question is...
Wow.
...do you sell these
in the U. K.?
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
We sell
in 40 different countries.
You must sell one
in each country.
[ Chuckles ]
That's cute.
Like, you haven't sold
that much.
?But you know what?
?I like it ?? "Cute."
?I love that you go, "Cute."
?I'm just saying.
Cuban: She's used to
dealing with you.
We're the third company
in the world
to ever pass
this crash test.
No other company.
?Hmm.
This is an $80 billion
industry, guys.
I have twins at home,
and my life right now
is about simplifying.
Like, anything that takes
time to put in, click in,
I don't want anything
to do with it.
There is no way ??
But you do that
for your children.
I do.
But here's my point.
And so what ??
what makes a difference
from your children
from your dog?
But here's my point.
There's no way in the world
I would do this.
It just takes too long.
I?I think that I do have ??
I'm all about saving time.
Yeah, so, I do have ??
And I'm gonna save you time.
I'm out.
I think
it's too early for me.
To me,
it's not investable yet.
It certainly isn't worth
a million bucks.
No. I'm out.
I love products
that make our loved ones safer.
The problem for me is, I think
that this looks complicated.
I think that you need to
go back to the drawing board
and make it simpler to use,
because it's just not ready yet.
Right now, I'm out.
Okay.
Carolyn and Juls,
I love fighting for animals
and protecting them,
and I didn't even think
about the danger
that I put my pets in
when they're in the car.
So that's what I love
about 10 years of this show.
I learn the most
from people like you
who are educating myself
and the public
about what's going on.
But, right now,
it doesn't seem like you have
everything figured out
for this product just yet.
I think you are
gonna figure it out,
but I think it's just
a little too early, so I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna tell you
where your challenge
is gonna be.
Your marketing
isn't good,
because you're not really even
addressing what the problem is.
That's why I asked
the question
of how many dogs
die in car accidents,
because you haven't done
anything that makes it real.
There isn't any statistics
on that.
We have searched everywhere
for those statistics.
Then invent some.
Right? The point is, you ??
You're selling cute...
Mm?hmm.
...when you should be
selling against fear.
Mm?hmm.
And I think you really
have to take your marketing
to the next level before
I could even consider.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you all so much
for your time.
Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Good luck, guys.
?All right, thanks, Juls.
?Congrats on your success.
?Thank you.
I am really disappointed that
we didn't get a deal today,
but the Sharks gave us some
really good advice in there.
They encouraged us
to just work harder
and to get our stuff in order,
and we're gonna do it.
And we're gonna kill it.
Yep.
