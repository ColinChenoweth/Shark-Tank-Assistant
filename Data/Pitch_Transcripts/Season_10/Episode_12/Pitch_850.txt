Hi. I'm Zahra
from Oakland, California.
I'm here seeking $200,000 for
2.5% of my company, Monti Kids.
?Wow.
?2.5%?
?Wow.
?Sharks...
85% of the brain
is formed by age 3.
Research shows these early years
are the most critical
for learning,
yet most children under 3
aren't even in school yet.
They're at home,
leaving parents guessing
how to support
their baby's development.
That's why, when I became a mom,
I created Monti Kids
for my kids.
Monti Kids is
a comprehensive learning program
that's designed to fill the gap
from birth
to the school?age years.
It's based
on the Montessori Method,
and it's easy
for families to use at home.
Families can subscribe any time
between pregnancy and age 3.
Every three months, they receive
a box of Montessori toys
tailored to their child's
stage of development.
For parents, we send
weekly e?mails with videos
that show them how to introduce
the toys like an expert.
Of course, results may vary.
Monti Kids
is not a toy subscription.
It's an educational program
that gives children
a strong foundation for learning
right from birth.
So, Sharks, who wants to
help give children
the very best start?
Do you have some examples
of some things?
I ?? Yeah, I have some samples
for you, actually.
Any one?
Any one you like.
Okay.
Whatever calls to you.
Thank you.
?Thank you.
?You're welcome.
?Thank you.
?Good job, Lori.
Quickly. Good.
?What did you do?
?Thank you.
Kassam: Oh, you're welcome.
I think I take it out
and put it back in.
?[ Laughing ] Yeah.
?Yeah.
So, how ??
how about this one, Zahra?
What's the deal here?
Kassam: So ?? So, that...
I got a blue ball.
This is for ??
What ?? What am I learning
here ?? ball in hole?
So, this is called
object permanence.
So, little babies,
around 5 months,
if you put the ball in the hole,
they're not gonna look for it.
They don't understand that
that ball is still there.
Around 7, 8 months,
they start learning,
"It's gone, but I can look
for it and find it."
Are you interviewing
2?month?olds
and asking what they like?
So, this is based
on the Montessori Method.
The Montessori Method has been
around for over 100 years
in 20,000 schools
around the world.
So, effectively, this is
do?it?yourself Montessori.
Exactly. For 0 to 3,
because 0 to 3 Montessori
is not accessible.
Those 20,000 Montessori schools
around the world
mostly start at age 3 and up.
You seem quite an expert,
so tell us about you.
Sure. So, I went to Harvard.
I studied psychology.
I graduated top of my class,
summa cum laude.
I got my master's
from the Harvard
Graduate School of Education,
and then I became
a Montessori?trained teacher...
?Wow.
?...internationally certified
for babies
from birth to age 6.
The real deal.
I was teaching
in Montessori preschool.
I absolutely loved it.
And then my first child
was born.
And the school where I was
working started at age 3,
like most preschools
around the world.
And, given my background,
I know that 0 to 3,
it's the most important time
for their learning
for their foundation.
Zahra, if I was a customer...
Yes.
...and I wanted to sign up,
what would I pay?
How would it work?
So, we have eight levels.
A level lasts two,
three months.
Including all the content
for the parents, it's $297.
?$297?!
?For three months?
?For those two shelves of toys?
?Three months.
?Do you send it back after that?
?You do not,
because your child
is not gonna stop using this
after three months.
They're gonna use it ??
So, Zahra, I get
one, two, three, four,
five, six toys for $300.
Yes.
And the content, which is
actually the most valuable part
for a lot of parents.
What does it cost you to make
all this stuff and send them?
So, $120 is our cost.
Zahra, do you have
tons of sales?
Like, 'cause you're asking
for $200,000 for 2.5%.
So, we have been selling
for 14 months,
and we've done $550,000
in sales.
Well, good for you. That's good.
Thank you.
Oh, hey, that's very good.
Thank you.
We're growing 20% month
over month since we launched.
What did you make
on $550,000? Anything?
No, we're ?? we're making the
decision to ?? to raise money
to invest
to grow exponentially.
Have you raised any money
at any valuations prior?
We have raised ??
Of course she has.
She went to Harvard.
So?
We have raised
$2.8 million to date.
?Wow!
?Oh! That's the valuation!
Kassam: There's a huge need
in the market.
Parents are looking for learning
and development resources
for their babies,
and there is a gap.
The re??
You know, the gap I described.
But that all exists.
So, there is
actually a lot of differences,
and they're
nuanced differences.
You won't find toys
that are as simple as ours.
With all due respect,
there are things like this.
There's also ??
It's just really telling us
why is yours better when
you're not apples to apples.
So...
So, the ?? the aspect
of a program.
So, for a parent
to know when ??
what age do you give that
to a child
and how do you present it
to them
and what ?? how do you ??
So it's really
the learning method.
It's not hard to do. It's not
hard to look up on YouTube.
Greiner:
When you first walked in,
I thought,
"Ooh, interesting."
Like, I?I really get it.
But where I have a problem is,
I do feel that most people,
it would be very difficult
to pay $1,200 a year
to go into toys.
I would love to bring
our price down as we grow.
But, Zahra, most of us grew up
with nothing here on the panel.
I mean, I grew up
with a stick and a rock.
Robert was playing
with a rat on a boat
coming over here from Croatia.
It was a nice rat, though.
Kevin had a wooden nickel
he was playing with.
I mean ??
And we turned out okay.
And you want to give your
children more than what you had.
Well, listen.
I assume.
I mean, I'll ??
I'll be very honest.
With an ??
an $8 million valuation...
This is a ??
a huge global opportunity.
We have customers
buying our ?? our products
from all over the world.
I got it. I got it. But listen.
But listen, Zahra. Zahra.
Sorry.
Just good luck.
I'm out.
Thank you, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I just want to tell you ??
O'Leary: Zahra, how much cash
do you have in the bank
right now?
We have $200,000 in the bank
right now,
and then we have commitments
coming in.
And what's your burn rate
right now?
We are burning
about $95,000 a month.
?A month?
?You know how I ??
?Oh!
?Yeah. But we have ??
?A month?
?A month?
We have a team of six people
right now.
You better ?? You better
cut that down to three.
O'Leary: Zahra, you've got
to get the whacking stick out.
We have $500,000
in commitments...
Like that thing.
Start whacking people.
...from investors coming in,
and I'm here to make a deal,
because...
God, Zahra, as much
as I love you...
?Yes?
?Whoa.
...and I love
what it does for kids,
$200,000 for 2.5%?
I'm sorry.
That's just too rich
for my blood.
I'm out.
?Okay, okay.
?Staying on the numbers,
you've done $550,000
since inception.
Did you have any net on that,
or what are your losses to date?
So, we're losing about $20,000
a month right now.
Okay, so, how much
have you lost in aggregate?
About $900,000.
[ Inhales sharply ]
We just increased our burn.
We just moved into an office.
We just hired someone
who's doing school partnerships
and mom ambassador marketing.
But how you allocate your
resources is ?? is critical.
Well, so, starting this up,
I talked about the story
of designing, manufacturing...
Right. No, I get it.
But it goes to the heart
of decision?making, right?
You've gone through
$2.6 million,
and you are so committed
to that what you have
is so much better
than everything else,
your decision?making
in terms of being a business
i?is not what I'd want to
see in a business.
But, Mark ??
And for those reasons, I'm out.
Can I ??
Here's where I'm at.
Anybody else besides you
standing up there
with your $2.8 million raised,
$2.6 million gone,
$90,000 burn rate per month
would not be smiling
anymore.
[ Laughs ]
It's a horrible story.
But for some reason,
you have
this incredibly
captivating character
that we're still listening
to you.
So, you have
a great degree.
Harvard sounds really fancy,
but you missed one school.
You didn't go
to the school of hard knocks.
Somebody like you
that burns through
$2.6 million like that
tells me you've missed
a reality in life
of how hard it is to get
that kind of money.
I understand that. We ??
You know
what you're missing?
You're missing discipline.
We started the company ??
You're missing discipline
today. That's what you are.
Thank you for the feedback.
So, because of
your incredible ability
with this crazy story
and I still like you,
I want to be in on it.
I think there's a market,
and I have twins.
Okay.
But...
Zahra has already spent
on her Montessori?based
toy?subscription company,
Monti Kids,
but he's still interested.
I want to be in on it.
I think there's a market,
and I have twins.
Okay.
But...
Can I just tell you ??
But no!
Okay, sorry. Go ahead.
See?
No, no, no.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please.
I'm gonna make you an offer,
and you kept talking. Shh.
Okay.
So, here's what I like.
I love the market.
I love where you're going.
I know how hard it is
to raise money,
and I know
how to get revenue.
Okay.
You got to ramp up
the revenue.
Yes.
Here's my offer.
I'll give you the $200,000,
I'll come on the board,
I'll help you
run this thing,
'cause I really believe
in it.
But I want 10%,
'cause that's how much value
I think
I can bring to it.
'Cause if you don't get
somebody like me with reality,
you're gonna go
off a cliff.
He's right.
That's my offer.
Can I just say that ??
Thank you so much.
O'Leary: I'll tell you
what I'm willing to do.
I listened to this story,
and just from the blank piece
of paper, listening to numbers,
they're horrific.
You're ?? You're gonna
burn out in six weeks.
You won't have any cash.
But you really require
some adult supervision.
I'm not kidding. So here's
the only deal I'd consider.
I'll give you the $200,000,
I'm taking the 2.5%,
which is meaningless equity
at this point.
I?I mean, it ?? I wouldn't
even get out of bed for 10%.
But I'm gonna put
a royalty on it.
I want $10 a unit until
I get back my $200,000,
so you have to sell 20,000
of these things, right?
Then I want to go down
to $2.50 a unit
till I get back
another $600,000,
and then it goes away.
That's venture debt.
?We ??
?The huge smile on your face
that has been here the entire
time, I watched it just sink.
No, but you're ??
You got to face reality here.
I mean, you're very,
you know, tenacious.
I love the story.
Kassam: Yes.
You know,
you're very credible.
I had dyslexia
when I was young.
I used all kinds of
wooden blocks and all this.
I still have it.
But I went through
the learning process.
I'm a believer in the ??
in ??
in the whole
Montessori system.
Zahra, you're not growing
quickly enough
to take on venture debt.
So ?? So, can I just say
that we have cash coming in?
Right.
We also have the ability
to get more cash if we need it,
but I'm gonna be disciplined.
You have two offers.
Make a decision.
Robert.
Zahra.
Would you consider $200,000
for 5%.
No.
Okay.
And is there any way, Kevin,
you would consider doing
more money for more equity
without a royalty?
No, because the structure
I'm providing you with
forces you to be very focused
on paying me back.
Robert,
would you consider $200,000
for 5% of equity
and 5% advisor's shares?
Just so we can ??
I don't care how you
structure it.
Okay.
You want to give me
5% advisory?
Yes.
I'm okay with that.
$200,000 for 10%.
Would you consider
working together?
Hang on, Zahra.
Cuban: You've just
proven our point.
You realize that.
John: She's talking
her way out of this.
Well, I'm ??
I'm talking about the value
of getting two Sharks.
You are, but you're talking
your way out of this.
I just want to
put it out there.
You ?? You had a deal.
You came to a deal.
You negotiated a deal.
Robert, let's do it.
No. Sorry.
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.
Seriously.
You're treating money
like it's some hypothetical
Harvard project.
I ??
I gave you an offer.
You tried to give me
founder shares.
I said yes. I said yes once.
I said yes twice.
I said yes three times,
and what do you do?
I ??
You say, "Do you want
to work with Kevin"?
I just was trying to get
multiple Sharks in.
Everybody wants to
work with Kevin.
I was trying to get
multiple Sharks in.
Oh, come on.
But I ?? Honestly,
I'm so grateful ??
I work really hard
for my money.
If I was you, after
I've lost all that money,
I wouldn't play around.
When it's real money,
it's really important to me.
I'm sorry, but
I?I?I don't want to do it.
You want to do a deal with
Kevin? Do a deal with Kevin.
I'm out.
Well, then. All roads
lead back to Mr. Wonderful.
