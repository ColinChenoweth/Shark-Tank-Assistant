Hey, Sharks.
My name is Noel Durity.
And I'm here seeking $225,000
for a 15% stake in my company...
Twist It Up Combs.
[ Chuckles ]
Twist It Up Combs allows people
with Afrocentric hair...
[ Greiner chuckles ]
...to wake up and embrace
their natural twists.
Now, if you don't have
Afrocentric hair,
you may not realize that
hundreds of millions of people
struggle with this every day.
But not anymore.
Twist It Up Comb is here
to help you style and profile
with no harmful chemicals,
with no tiresome
maintenance routine.
And most of all,
we can finally say bye?bye
to the painful struggle
of us picking out our hair.
Aah!
[ Thud ]
Wow.
Here's a Twist It Up Comb, man.
Try that out instead.
Sharks, I don't think
you really understand...
[ Laughs ]
...just how wonderful
this comb is.
The comb is compact enough that,
when you go to a bar,
just pull the comb
out your pocket,
and you're ready to meet
your future wife or husband.
[ Laughs ]
Now, Sharks,
without further ado...
Hm.
Deejay, do me a favor.
Drop that beat.
? Ever since I got
a Twist It Up Comb ?
[ Laughter ]
? My life's been wonderful ?
? Ever since I got
a Twist It Up Comb ?
Oh!
? My life's been wonderful ?
? Ever since I got
a Twist It Up Comb ?
? My life's been wonderful ?
Man: Yeah.
? Ever since I got
a Twist It Up Comb ?
? My life's been wonderful ?
[ Music ends ]
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, my God!
?Who's willing
to twist things up and invest
in the Twist It Up Comb?
?Ah.
?Thank you very much.
We're gonna pass out samples.
You know they ain't
gonna let you back home
after that one, right?
?Thank you.
?Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you.
?Daymond.
Enjoy.
?All right.
?Mark. Enjoy, enjoy.
?Thank you, sir.
Okay, so, I need to
understand this...
Yeah.
...technically.
When you were picking
the hair, right...
Yeah.
...it's smooth, right?
Well, so...
And this, you're getting, like,
texture all the way around.
Correct. So, the thing with ??
The thing with Afrocentric hair,
our hair grows up, right?
It doesn't grow down.
So ever since I was born,
I've never had anything
that allowed me to wake up
and embrace my natural hair
without any chemicals,
without having
some special sleep regimen.
Like, it's a ?? it's a process.
Why is the pick
so popular?
So, a pick is hurtful,
for me, anyways.
Like, I won't pick out my hair
unless I go in the shower first.
'Cause it gets caught.
Correct. 'Cause you got to ??
You got to pull, right?
So...
How does this do anything?
It just goes at the top?
Yeah. So, if you...
No. So,
if you look at my hair ??
And I don't know if it's not ??
if it's super?twisted or not.
When you pull this in, right...
Oh, you have to actually,
like, throw it in there.
Push. And, no, you just do
a nice little circle.
Just go ahead and do it,
Robert.
?All right. Let me try.
?Yeah.
?Doesn't that hurt?
?No, it does not.
Because it's woven,
it doesn't pull the hair,
which is very important.
If I grow my hair out,
right,
if I take a pick...
Yeah.
...full?blown Afro comes,
right?
Correct. Correct.
So what this does
is compresses it
and brings it down and then
gives you whatever natural look.
So this is exactly the opposite
of what a pick does.
Correct.
Okay.
Noel, how much
does it cost?
$29.95, and that includes
shipping and tax.
And what's it cost you
to make one?
Around $3.50.
And do you have sales?
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, 100%. Yes.
?Yeah, baby.
All right. Hit me.
My first year,
we only did $95,000.
And this is
all a learning curve, so...
Hey, that's pretty good.
What happened
is that I did a show
at the International Beauty Show
in January.
We sold 500 in three days.
I did $95,000 in 2017.
From January to April,
I did $101,000.
Is this overseas?
Are you making these in China?
So, the meshes
are made overseas,
which is why I have a
manufacturing problem right now.
There is a pollution
done in China right now,
and it's shut down
manufacturing
for, like,
the last 30 to 45 days.
So, what are your sales
this year gonna be?
What do you mean, "a pollution"?
So, if I can get China
back on with the meshes,
I can easily get to $500,000.
Wow.
Noel, is it all online?
It's 70% online,
30% wholesale.
I did a lot of shows last year.
I did about 20.
20 shows? Wow,
that's a lot of shows, so...
Last year, yeah. And it's all ??
It's mostly East Coast.
Okay. And no one's
knocked you off yet?
No. It's patent?pending.
?Would a woman use this?
?Yes!
When you go to New York,
when you go to D. C.,
there is a lot of girls
that they call "TWAs" ??
Tiny with Afros ??
that rock the natural ??
?"Tiny with Afros"?
?Correct. Tiny with Afros.
I got to get back to the hood.
Man, I don't...
Tiny with Afros.
I don't know any of this stuff.
[ Laughs ]
Well, yeah.
When you sell it online,
how are you getting
those consumers
to come to your website?
So, I taught myself
how to do Facebook advertising.
Did you buy any ads?
Yes.
And how much
did you spend?
I spent about $18,000
in advertising.
So, what do you need
the money for?
So, definitely inventory.
So, since Day 1
since I created this,
I've had a hard problem
keeping up with inventory.
I've sold out close
to seven times. It's the demand.
When I started doing
the Facebook advertising,
the sales
are coming in nonstop.
So, what ?? what was
your last month in sales?
$41,000.
Okay, so, how much did
you net on that $41,000?
So, I couldn't
really tell you that,
because the problem
is that I?I prepay
for all my shows
as the money comes in.
So you do it
on a cash basis.
So, do you have anybody
who does your books for you?
Yes.
Okay, so, they don't give you
an income statement
or anything every month?
So, the person
that does my books
got hired, like,
a month and a half ago.
That's not what I like to hear.
I know.
Well, to organize everything.
Before that,
I was doing it myself.
Right.
But to actually
get it down ??
But you weren't printing out
statements to yourself,
so you don't know.
Correct.
Okay. That's not good.
Listen, you're an
amazing guy, man.
Hey, thank you.
I mean,
what a great story.
I love the hustle.
I love the grind.
Yeah.
I loved the dance moves.
[ Laughs ]
But I know nothing
about the product.
You did a great job
explaining it.
But for me to invest,
I got to at least have
a sense for it.
You know,
I wish you all the best.
I appreciate it.
Not for me. I'm out.
?But I also sell to men.
?Okay. All right, Noel.
I mean, I'm ??
I'm equal opportunity.
I got ?? I got ??
I got a solution here.
?Oh.
?We're gonna come in together.
All right?
?You're being rude.
He'll deal
with the licensing.
And if he closes
the license deal, he's in.
If he doesn't get
a license deal, he's not in,
and then I give you $225,000
for the 25%.
I can help you
with the Chinese stuff.
I can help
you with the online stuff.
So, same deal ??
$225,000 for 25%.
?Don't think too long.
?Noel, this is an amazing deal.
?Yeah, it's good. It's good.
?$225,000.
I'm enjoying the moment.
I'm taking it in.
I'm enjoying the moment.
?Savor the moment.
Don't enjoy it too long.
Don't enjoy it too long.
It could go.
This is a once?in?a?lifetime,
you know? Yeah, yeah.
Um...I?I like that.
Is that a yes?
It's ?? It's a yes.
It's a 100% yes.
?All right.
?Yeah.
Yeah, baby.
You're gonna make me wish
I had hair again, man.
?Congratulations.
?Appreciate it, man.
?You were killing me.
?Oh, let's do the dance!
You'll do really well.
You'll do really well.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
Time to dance. Go ahead.
Hey, hit the music!
?Hey!
?Hey!
?Hey!
?Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
?Am I doing it right?
[ Laughter ]
Durity: Hey!
