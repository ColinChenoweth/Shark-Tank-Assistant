Hi, my name is Saskia Sorrosa,
founder and Real Flavor officer
of Fresh Bellies,
headquartered
in Westchester, New York.
I am seeking $275,000
in exchange
for 5% of my company.
Wow.
Fresh Bellies is
a new baby?food company
that sets kids up to be healthy,
adventurous eaters for life.
Imagine eating sugar
for every meal.
Ew.
Herjavec: Ugh.
That's my diet.
[ Laughter ]
Every baby?food product
on the market today
hides the real taste
of vegetables
by overloading them
with fruit sugars.
By doing this,
we've been training babies
to crave sweet foods
over the good stuff.
Now, imagine I told you
I had a magic trick
to get your kids to actually
enjoy eating their veggies.
You ready?
I'm gonna need your help
with this, so count with me.
One...
Count with me!
All: Two...
Three!
Ahh!
?Oh!
?Whoa.
David Blaine's
still keeping a job.
Sorrosa: That's not
the magic trick.
That's just a big mess.
The real magic
is Fresh Bellies.
Fresh Bellies!
Fresh Bellies.
At Fresh Bellies,
we never mask our veggies
with sweet fruit.
Instead, we season
with herbs and spices
like garlic and thyme.
Each chef?formulated recipe
encourages babies' palates
to grow
so they are less likely
to become picky eaters
later in life.
Fresh Bellies is leading
the shift
towards veggie?forward food
that moms, babies,
and pediatricians love.
So, Sharks, let's disrupt
the baby?food industry
and give kids
a healthy, adventurous start
with Fresh Bellies.
?Ta?da.
?Thank you.
?We are dying to try it.
?Yeah, we got to try it.
I'd like to pass out samples
now.
Don't trip.
I'll try not to.
Lori, this is for you.
Greiner:
Thank you, Robert.
I have to feed her,
'cause she can't.
I can't.
Hang on, Lori.
Sorrosa: [ Laughs ]
Saskia is such
a cool name.
Me and Mark aren't ??
Thank you. It's Dutch.
Me and Mark aren't ??
But I'm not Dutch.
We're not clumsy.
We don't need a bib.
You have four
of them there,
and the one that has a pita chip
in it
is cauliflower, bell peppers,
and garlic.
The broccoli Swiss chard
has garlic in it.
Lot of garlic.
The golden beets...
It is so good.
Wow.
Yeah. Thank you.
Saskia,
you're basically saying
the idea is to start your baby
on plant?based
so they never acquire
a taste for sugar.
Is that the idea?
The idea is
to introduce babies
to savory flavors
so that they develop
a palate for it.
So, there's such a thing
called a flavor window.
Between 4 and 7 months
is actually
when we're most recept??
receptive to flavors
as humans.
And right now, in that window,
we've been feeding babies
fruit sugars.
What's your background?
So I used to work
at the NBA.
I worked at the NBA
for 11 years.
What'd you do,
for who?
I was VP of Marketing.
Wow.
You were at the NBA taking care
of a lot of babies.
?[ Laughs ]
?No, that'd be today.
We had grown men
back in my day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
But how did you make
the formulation?
Who ?? Do you have somebody
on your team that made it?
Yeah, so I started making
this food for my daughters.
And when I decided I wanted
to make a business out of it,
I hired an executive chef
who went with me
into a commercial kitchen,
and we were making all
of these formulations together.
And do you have sales
today?
We do.
So, we've only had
six months of sales to date,
and we've generated close
to $100,000 in sales.
By the end of this year,
it will be at $570,000
in revenue.
Good for you.
Saskia,
your product is beautiful.
The packaging's gorgeous.
I get the feeling you've raised
a lot of money to do this.
We've raised money.
How much?
$1.6 million to date.
Oh!         Oh!
Oh!                          Oh!
What valuation?
That's a lot of money.
Our series A has been
on a $7 million valuation,
but we brought that ??
7 million bucks?
You are good
at marketing.
[ Laughs ]
How much does it cost
to make,
and how much do you charge
for it?
So, any product
on the shelf ??
all the typical,
shelf?stable ??
Oh, by the way,
I didn't mention.
This is also refrigerated,
so our product is
preservative?free.
That's even worse.
That's worse
because you have to fight
for the refrigerator space.
So, because our product
is so innovative,
and retailers are looking
to innovate
their baby?food category,
we've had open doors
at every retailer
that we've spoken to.
They're not asking you
for any listing fees yet?
No slotting fees.
Barkley: Can you answer
my question?
How are your prices
compared to the competition?
So, on the shelf, prices range
anywhere from $1.99,
usually for the pouches,
and we retail at $3.59.
Is this really just trying
to train babies to eat better?
The core of our mission
is combating childhood obesity.
there's another number
I'm not clear on, Saskia.
You said
your original raise
was at
a $7 million valuation.
Our series A.
And today,
what's your valuation
that you're asking.
$5.5 million.
Yes, yeah.
Why are you doing
a down?round?
Because we understood the value
of bringing a Shark on,
and so we got our shareholders
to approve being able to ??
Smart, good for you.
O'Leary: Saskia,
the biggest problem
I've got with your deal is
if you can't ever get that
in the refrigerated section.
How are you gonna do that?
We disagree with that.
We think we can, and we ??
How?
Stores want innovation.
We're riding this new wave
of pediatric recommendation
that is all about this.
It's all about flavor.
All about garlic.
We agree, but you're
constraining yourself.
About seasoning your food
not with sugar or salt,
but with real herbs.
You're constraining yourself
by the shelf?space availability.
Yeah, so, I'll answer that.
And then the other
grave concern,
which is the elephant
in the room
we have
to deal with now ??
How many people want babies
with bad breath?
[ Laughter ]
Imagine, all their friends
don't want to see them.
They don't want to invite them
to the birthday party.
"Oh, that's the baby
with the bad breath."
"Give that baby a mint."
That's the garlic baby!
My concern as a black man,
clearly obesity is a big problem
in our community.
I don't know ??
and Mark touched on it
a little bit ??
if my people
can afford this.
That's my biggest concern.
Yeah,
we want to get there.
I mean,
we want to make good food
accessible to more people,
because they should be
eating this.
They shouldn't be priced
out of a market.
As we scale and we find
more manufacturing partners
and we're able to distribute
to more stores,
we're hoping that we can
get the price down.
Saskia, I think the idea
of palates in training,
man, that's an uphill
marketing battle,
and I think that's gonna take
a lot of money.
You're gonna need, I think,
millions of dollars
to get to
a break?even point.
It's just not for me.
I'm out.
This could be
an uphill battle.
We understand
that culturally
we've been conditioned
to eat a certain way.
Culture is very difficult
to change.
But that doesn't mean
it's not the right thing to do.
And we have
an unwavering commitment
to do the right thing
in really combating
childhood obesity
and getting kids to eat
the way they should be eating.
I think childhood obesity
is a big problem,
but I don't think
this is the solution,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
The problem for me
was I liked some of them,
and some of them
were really strong.
Mm?hmm.
Herjavec: Yeah.
Like, I felt,
too strong.
Mm?hmm.
I think there's some work
to do
on some
of the flavor profiles...
Mm?hmm.
...um, so that it's maybe
a little more subtle
while you're
introducing it,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
I'm a big believer
that doing the right thing
in business always pays off,
right?
But you've alluded to the battle
you have ahead.
You may have to raise
$50 million, $100 million more
to get
where you want to go.
The amount of dilution
that would come after us
would make it almost, you know,
a non?ownership position.
And so I think
it's a worthwhile goal.
It's a battle
that's bigger
than what you've presented to us
right now,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary:
Let me just say that you're
a very impressive executive...
Herjavec: Yeah.
...and I don't say that
very often ??
because I was waiting for you
to trip up.
You nailed your numbers.
I like that, I really do.
But I hate your valuation.
I really hate it.
I mean, you don't make
any money,
you got nothing in sales,
it's the beginning
of the journey,
it's a mountain to climb.
If anybody can do it,
you can,
but I'm not going
on that journey with you.
I'm out.
Thank you.
?Good luck, Saskia.
?Thank you.
Thank you, Saskia.
Sorrosa: We're disrupting
an entire industry,
and it's really hard
to change people's minds,
but we know
we're on to something good,
and we're not gonna stop.
I tried all the foods,
and the one ??
the one flavor
I really couldn't stand
was the $5.5 million
valuation.
[ Laughs ]
That tasted terrible.
That's crazy. She has $100,000
in sales so far.
That's nuts.
Yeah,
that was a big mission.
You got to give her credit
for that.
