Hi, Sharks.
I'm Adam Haller.
And I'm Desiree Haller.
We are here today
seeking $50,000
in exchange for 13%
of our company, SubSafe.
Sharks,
I grew up on the water,
both boating
and offshore fishing.
I would always pack
an unprotected,
a vulnerable sub
in my cooler,
and after being on the water
all day,
I would pull it out,
only to find a wet,
squished mess.
?Ew!
?Boo!
?No!
?What's wrong with that?
[ Laughter ]
I've chose not to eat anything
at all
rather than take
one bite of soggy bread.
We were determined to find
a product
that would keep
our sub dry,
but there was nothing
on the market,
so that's when...
Both: SubSafe was born.
?Uh?oh!
?Touché, Desiree.
We have samples and subs
for you guys.
?Perfect!
?Wow.
That's actually
a great idea.
?It is a good idea.
?That is a great idea.
They told us your favorite color
was pink.
Okay, I'm good for pink.
Help me.
Thank you, Robert.
You have
gluten?free bread.
Cheers. Whoo!
Well, first of all,
gluten?free is not a thing.
It's my thing.
Stop it, man.
Tell you what, y'all sure do
a lot of eating on this show.
Uh?huh.
[ Laughter ]
Tell me about it.
This is a great sub.
So, what else
are you putting in this?
Well, I mean,
anything for dry storage.
Your phones, sunglasses,
keys, wallets.
You said it floated,
right?
Yes.
The 12?inch,
up to six pounds.
Up to six pounds, and the 6?inch
will hold four pounds.
Greiner: What else
do you have up there?
I can't see everything.
I'm just curious.
So, what we did ??
we strategically
flattened the ends
so that they could be used
as cups and bowls.
How much does it cost?
They are $17.95
on our website.
So the big one is $17?
?It comes with all three pieces.
?All three pieces.
So what this allows you to do
is order a 12?inch sub,
eat half now, cap it off,
throw it back in the cooler,
eat the other half later.
Desiree, what's the cost
to land it ??
to make it
and land it here?
$2.38.
Wow, that's really good.
So what are your sales?
We launched February 26th,
and we are just over $40,000
in sales.
?Why so low?
?Yeah.
We're fairly new, and we put
everything we had into this,
so we did not have a lot of
money to play with marketing.
How much
have you invested?
We have $37,000 of our own money
into this.
Do you want to tell them?
Yeah, so let me tell you
about that, um...
?Huh.
?Okay.
Um, she was a good girl.
No!
She gave me
three good years,
and I had to let her go.
Herjavec: Adam,
you sold the boat?!
I sold my boat.
Second best day
of a boat owner's life.
I sold our boat.
Our boat.
[ Laughter ]
What would you do
if you don't get the money?
He's gonna have to sell
his truck next.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: No!
Don't sell the dog!
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
Is there anything else
that looks like this?
So what ??
No, not at all.
Zero.
'Cause maybe nobody
needs it.
No.
No, it's definitely needed.
People are going crazy
over this.
Well,
they're going $40,000...
Worth of crazy.
Do you have a patent
on this?
We're pending.
On what?
Design.
Design.
The largest
sub?chain restaurant
contacted me
about a week and a half ago,
and they want to roll out
a campaign for summer 2019
with our product
in 1,500 locations.
Is it a national chain?
So they want to buy it
and brand it and give it away?
No. If you come in
and purchase a foot?long,
then you get a SubSafe
for "X" dollars.
Your biggest problem right now,
Desiree, is the name sucks.
The first thought
I had was "SubSafe"
meaning it's a safe,
physically, like,
you're gonna protect something,
and then "sub" meaning
under something else, right?
Greiner:
I like your name, SubSafe.
If people started
to understand what it was
and get to know what it is,
it's easy to remember,
but I just like to invest
in things that are broader.
That's all.
Because for me, I really have
to hit that kind of market.
Mm?hmm.
Good job on what this is.
I wish I could take the journey
with you,
but unfortunately,
because it is just
one container,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You've got a big problem
getting the message
out on this thing, okay?
But I'm intrigued with
the deal with the retailer,
which I could really
help you with,
but also I could help you
blow it up on social
a little bit.
How would I ever get
my money back is the problem.
I mean, I give you $50,000?
Ah, why am I doing this?
Herjavec: All right, Desiree,
I can't wait anymore.
I love it.
You're the real deal.
You're so committed.
You guys are so fun.
I don't know if Adam
actually can speak, but, uh...
I'll give you
the $50,000 for...
That's the problem.
[ Laughs ]
For 120%!
That's not enough equity,
and $50,000 isn't...
Let me think about it.
O'Leary: Charles,
what are you gonna do?
Listen, I think
it's a bigger market than subs.
Everybody's not bringing
one sandwich
when they're going fishing.
They're bringing a lot of stuff.
I think there's a wider market
out there for this product.
I think a lot of people's
gonna buy this.
Mark and I have an offer
for you.
We will give you
$100,000...
There you go.
But ??
50/50 each.
We want 25%
of the company.
We think the right way to do it
is to do $100,000
so we have plenty of money
to invest in marketing,
but we need 25% of the company,
Charles and I'd split it,
and you got a real fisherman,
and you got a real
digital marketer,
and we can do some business,
but you got to tell us
right now.
What an ??
That is so amazing.
Wow.
Thank you so much.
I don't even want
to counter.
You guys got a deal.
?Done.
?Deal.
This is incredible.
?Good deal.
?Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Great job, Desiree.
Way to kill
Mr. Wonderful, too.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Good job, big guy.
?Well done.
?Congratulations.
?Thank you.
?This is gonna be fun.
Thank you so much.
He gets to keep
the truck!
Yes.
[ Laughs ]
Herjavec: What's the biggest
fish you ever caught?
