Hi, I'm Taylor.
I'm from Venice, California.
Hi, I'm Sierra.
I'm from New York.
Our company is Zorpads.
We are seeking
a $150,000 investment
for an 8% stake
in our business.
Imagine this.
It's summer.
It's hot out.
You've ducked out of work
a little bit early.
You speed walked
four blocks.
You walk up to
your friend's apartment door.
You open it,
and that's when you see it.
What?
All the shoes are lined up
in the hallway.
You're gonna have to take your
shoes off right here, right now?
You've been wearing these shoes
since 8:00 a. m.
[ Chuckles ]
You're gonna fill
the entire apartment
with the putrid, rotten?egg,
old?cheese smell of feet.
Unless you remember
to put in your Zorpads.
This is a Zorpad.
Zorpads are
odor?zapping shoe inserts.
They're one size fits all,
ultra?thin, stick in place,
and don't change
the fit of your shoes.
They're super small
because they're made
with our revolutionary
NASA?tested technology
that packs each Zorpad
with more odor?destroying
surface area
than a full?size
tennis court.
People are obsessed
with Zorpads.
You see, they hate the sprays
that belong in bowling alleys,
the powders that turn your shoes
into sandboxes,
or the inserts that bunch up
and make your shoes so tight
it feels like you're walking
in straightjackets.
So, Sharks, you do not want
to miss the chance
to get in on a product
that is ripe
to take over the market.
We have some samples
for you.
?Cool.
?Mm?hmm.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Take the whole thing?
The whole ??
The whole thing.
?Oh, thank you.
?You're welcome.
Sierra,
what's in the bottle?
Smith: So, that's garlic.
Very potent.
Garlic.
So we found the most potent
smell that you can find.
Wiegele: All right,
so what you're gonna do,
you're gonna unscrew
the top of the jar,
smell the garlic...
Oh!
?It's a lot.
?Yeah.
And now take the swatch
of our revolutionary
NASA technology...
Kevin, don't eat that garlic.
It'll kill you.
...put it over the top,
and just try to smell
the garlic.
Taylor. So, Taylor's got
the SpaceX background.
?Taylor, I have a question.
?Oh, seriously?
Taylor,
you work at SpaceX?
So, my background was
in product development
at a large consumer goods
company.
Which one?
?At Clorox.
?Clorox, okay.
So, I did product development
for Brita water filters.
I actually earned five patents
for inventions there.
You did.
I did.
Wow.
And so, then moved down
to work in Aerospace
on air filtration
for an environmental control
and life?support system.
At SpaceX.
Yeah, at SpaceX.
Sierra, what do you do?
I do scaling and growth.
So, my background is primarily
in strategy and operations.
I worked
for a large hospital network.
I was the youngest director ??
male or female ??
at the company,
and then went on to become
chief of staff
to the CEO.
And how did you meet?
At Harvard Business School.
It says "Approved by NASA"
or "Invented by NASA."
Yeah, so, the technology
was tested by NASA
to clean the air aboard
the International Space Station.
The product is not endorsed
by NASA, though.
What's in this?
So, it's
an activated carbon cloth.
There's lots of activated carbon
cloth technologies out there.
?Yeah.
?So why is yours different?
So, we actually tested
our product and our material
against all of
the leading competitors,
and we found
that our technology
Taylor, you said that
this has more odor prevention
than a full tennis court?
Yep.
So, it looks small,
but it's actually filled
with a ton of little micropores,
which are a magnet for odor,
and so if you took
all of those micropores
and laid them out, it would
cover a full tennis court.
Okay, there we go.
So it's a density issue.
Exactly.
So, the fun fact
about our product
is that 40% of people
that use it
have never used
a shoe?odor?eliminating
solution before.
Yeah,
but how did they find you?
Yeah, so, right now,
we're doing ??
we do direct?to?consumer
marketing.
So we sell them
through our website,
and then we're launching
on Amazon, Walmart, and Jet.
Herjavec: Got it.
How much do you charge for them?
How many have you sold?
They're $5 per pair.
What does it cost you
to make them?
Currently,
it costs us $1.65.
Wow.
At scale,
it'll be 80 cents.
?Oh, you're making ??
?And is that in the U. S. A.
or is that...
?80 cents at scale?
It's all made in the U. S. A.
in New Jersey.
So what are
your total sales?
We've sold $103,000
to date.
Taylor and Sierra have
two offers on the table
from Charles and Lori
and Kevin
for their odor?eliminating
shoe inserts, Zorpads,
but Robert
may also be interested.
Herjavec: Do I give you
a better offer?
Because Lori's offer
is awful.
Sierra,
I just want to say this.
You know what they say about men
with little feet.
These guys got
little feet.
[ Laughter ]
I ?? I wouldn't do a deal
with these two little feet men.
Wow.
I trust her.
This is her field,
and I'm riding it with her.
Cuban: Ride or die.
Ride or die.
Greiner:
So, here's a question.
Do you want
the cheapest deal,
or do you want the most
successful?outcome deal?
I wouldn't give up
that much equity.
Smith: So, first of all,
thank you all for the offers.
Um, Lori and Charles, would you
beat the other two offers?
Beat them?
So you're saying
you want Charles and I
to give you $150,000
for 20%?
For less than 20%.
?Oh, guys, guys, guys...
?Oh, yeah.
?Less than 20%?
?Less than 20%?
I'll do it for 15%.
Herjavec: Ooh.
You know, like I said ??
Like I said.
Work on that.
Work on that, guys.
Bring it on down.
I know what I do.
I make millionaires,
and I'm right in there with you.
So do I.
So, we are not
apples to apples here.
Yes,
you're not Mr. Wonderful.
There's only one
Mr. Wonderful.
Barkley: Okay.
In fairness to me, also,
I'm giving you
a free commercial.
Guys, think about this.
Sierra, you didn't start
this company
to give up
that much equity.
You can get Charles
into a deal that works.
That's crazy.
Why would you go down
this journey and give up 20%?
Cuban: Guys, look.
That 2.5% ??
it's not worth
fighting over.
Sure it is.
It's equity.
You know how much I'd charge you
for an endorsement?
You're getting
this thing cheap.
?Congrats, Taylor.
?Thank you. Thank you.
?Good job, guys.
?Congrats, Sierra.
Charles, I got to put
your shoe next to mine.
Okay...
Herjavec: Oh, my.
Cuban: That's crazy.
Crazy.
That's so amazing.
Now that we have Lori
and Charles on board,
we are over the moon,
and we know that just means
lift?off for Zorpads.
Nice, nice, very nice.
Total lift?off.
Thanks.
[ Laughs ]
