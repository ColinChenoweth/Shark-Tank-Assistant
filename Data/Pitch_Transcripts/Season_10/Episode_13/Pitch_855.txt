Hi, Sharks.
My name is Levi Wilson.
My name is Tim Todd,
and we're from
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Our company name
is Life Lift Systems.
We are seeking $550,000
in exchange
for 15% of our company.
Wow.
Each year,
around 1,200 tornados
tear across
the United States.
Living in Oklahoma,
let me tell you ??
A tornado shelter
can never be too close.
When it comes
to tornado shelters,
there's two main types ??
above?ground ??
which take up
valuable floor space
you don't have
in your home ??
or below?ground ??
they're tough to access,
they're prone
to having leaks,
and of course
all the spiders.
[ Chuckles ]
We have created a product
that can be installed
in the comfort
of your own home.
Introducing the Vortex Vaults
telescoping tornado shelter.
?Oh, my God.
?Wow.
The only shelter that mounts
right underneath your mattress.
"Auntie Em! Auntie Em!"
It takes approximately
60 seconds to raise.
In tornado season, you usually
have plenty of warning,
or, in a home invasion,
you can actually still
jump underneath it.
?It keeps going.
?That is amazing.
It looked like Kevin's crypt
when he comes up.
[ Laughter ]
We're actually coming up with
a pool table
that will do the same thing,
a kitchen island,
and a work bench
that you put in your garage.
Our shelter's been tested
to withstand an EF5 tornado.
That's not just
the 250 mile?an?hour winds,
but whatever the winds
bring with it,
like this 4,000 pound car.
?Wow.
?Wow.
The telescoping safe room
is the perfect
space?friendly option
to safely accommodate
your family.
Now, Sharks,
who wants to come check it out?
?I do.
?Oh, I do.
?Absolutely.
?[ Laughs ]
How many people
can fit in there?
Now, Charles,
you're a little bit bigger
than most people, so...
?Wait, it's scary.
?We're gonna look at maybe...
I want to see if you can get
in there, Charles.
Maybe one for Charles.
Herjavec:
Charles, get in here!
You brought your book?
Barkley: I did.
?Oh!
?Oh! It's scary!
Greiner: Doesn't it, like,
if you close this in...
You got in it okay?
Yeah, I did.
Herjavec:
Doesn't have air circulation ??
how do you breathe?
?Yeah.
?So, the air circulation ??
there's vents.
Herjavec:
Where does air come?
The vents are all around
the outside.
They are covered.
Greiner:
Yeah, Robert, look.
Wow,
that's really interesting.
So, guys, if the house
takes a direct hit...
Todd: Yep.
You know those scenes
where all you see
is the old frame
of the house,
nothing else is around ??
is that thing
just sitting there?
Yep.
Yes.
So it won't go up
in the twister.
No.
So, it has to be bolted
to a concrete foundation.
To a concrete foundation,
so how does it work in a house?
So, in a typical house, we
bring it in a piece at a time.
It's all bolt?together,
so you can get it in any room.
Really.
The cement slab
will be there still
when the house is gone.
Like, you know,
is there any way
that it could come down
while you're in it?
No. There's a battery
shut?off switch
that kills directly
at the battery.
So, both of you are
from Oklahoma,
where there's how many tornados
would you say hit a year?
So, in Oklahoma, the average
is around 60 tornados.
Wow.
I've actually been
in two tornados.
Oh.
Once when I was a kid,
leveled
my grandparents' place.
The other time was
we were in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
and 50 yards in front of us,
a tornado
whips right through
and wipes out
a Braum's.
Wow.
How much
is the total cost?
Retail price, $6,000 range
for the queen and king size.
Fully installed?
Yes.
Yep.
And how does that compare
to a normal shelter?
Todd: It's ?? It's ??
I'm used to seeing those
underground.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's real comparable ??
the same price.
Basically,
a box that's made out of metal.
And where do people
put it?
That's one
of the biggest issues.
Right now, you have to put it
in your garage,
or you have to pour a slab
outside.
Most people don't want
to give up that kind of space
in their garage.
What are your sales?
We've sold about 119
in the last 3 1/2, 4 months.
?Oh, wow.
?119?
Todd: Yes.
Oh, dang,
that's pretty damn good.
How did you sell them?
Mostly through social media
advertising.
Facebook ads.
Have you installed them all?
Not all of those yet.
We're in the process
of setting up dealers.
We did some of
the first installs ourself,
but we're gonna try to go
to the wholesale market.
How much money
have y'all made to date?
I think there's around $550,000
in sales.
And that's
in three months.
That's crazy.
Good for you guys.
?That's really great.
?Wow.
Barkley: Break down the numbers
for me.
What are your costs?
The cost of the unit's
around $3,600.
We're retailing ??
wholesaling them out
for about $4,850,
and so our on?average gross
is about $1,250.
Is that enough margin,
though?
We're shooting
for about $1,000 net profit.
It's not enough.
So, why not charge more?
That's our unknown.
It's the supply and demand.
I don't know
what we can get away with.
Why wouldn't somebody
pay $9,000 for this?
I think so, yes.
Why haven't you tried that?
I think they would.
I can tell you this.
We've been a company
for six months.
So you're still learning.
Yeah.
We had an opportunity,
we took it,
we're here.
Is this
y'all full?time job?
I actually own
a machine shop.
And we do ??
That's even better, right?
And you're what, now?
Marketing.
Do you have a patent
on this?
Yes.
We have a patent pending,
utility patent
for the telescoping system
for a safe room.
Your price ?? does it include
the installation?
Yes.
So, for $6,000 ??
Too low.
Way too low.
Way too low.
How long does it take you
to install it?
I'll tell you
why it's too low.
Wilson: About four hours.
You can't put a distributor
in the middle.
You can't put a dealer
in there.
You're not making anywhere close
to enough money,
especially since the fact
you're customizing it,
showing up
for four hours.
What's your game plan to sell
a lot of these?
What we want is wholesalers
all over the U. S.
Do you have any wholesalers
lined up today?
We've got two dealers
in Oklahoma.
We're talking with a chain
right now
that has 140 locations.
Cuban: You've got to increase
your margins, man.
Just making 1,000 bucks ??
just the hassle factor
in dealing with it...
Yeah.
Okay.
...and making sure,
'cause people are gonna ask you
to check on it.
How much
have you invested?
We've put in together
$250,000.
250 grand is
no small amount of money.
Right now we're just trying
to find installers
across the nation.
How did you come up
with $500,000 for 15%?
We based it on our sales.
We really think we're gonna sell
1,500 shelters a year.
Or more.
Or more.
I don't think
the business model's firm yet
in terms of your margin,
because to scale,
you've got to get
another $3,000 in the mix
because they've got to make
1,000, 1,500 bucks
if they're gonna spend all day
putting it in.
Herjavec:
It's a great story.
I mean,
you put in your own money,
you're all in.
I like it, I just ??
I don't love it.
And it's not you,
it's not your business.
Well, before you get there,
don't say it.
Stay in.
[ Laughter ]
Just stay in.
You know.
Just stay in,
because, you know what?
This thing's gonna make
a lot of money.
It's just not for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
All right.
Hey, thanks, bud,
I appreciate it.
?Thank you.
?Great job.
It's not really ??
It's not really ??
you're not really selling
a tornado shelter.
You're selling insurance.
?Yeah.
?That's what it is,
because it's a decision
about your life.
I kind of like
if it's a home prison,
'cause if your kids
are acting up...
Todd: Time?out.
[ Laughter ]
Why not a crypt,
Kevin?
Daddy's gonna raise the bed,
and you know where your kids
are going.
Like, it's a lock?down.
That's good.
It's a really interesting idea,
but not for me.
I'm out.
All right.
Okay, thank you.
We appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Guys,
it's a very clever idea,
but for $550,000,
I don't think
I can get my money back,
so I'm out.
All right,
hey, thanks a lot.
We appreciate you.
Levi and Tim's
telescoping tornado shelter,
but Lori is also interested.
Greiner:
I love it, too.
I think
it's pretty ingenious,
and I know that
there's a huge market for it.
Lori,
you could put it on QVC.
I ??
[ Laughter ]
You want to know something?
You could lock yourself
in it.
I don't know, but I know
there's a million ways
in which to advertise it.
I think you could sell
just as many...
I don't know.
You have to see it.
This is visual.
Yeah.
As Mark was saying,
I'm gonna give you the $550,000
for 25%.
That's exactly what
I was gonna offer you, so ??
I mean, the difference is,
I'm right there.
Right, and so it's gonna be
really easy for us
to work together,
really easy to build this
out in Dallas
and the entire state of Texas.
Listen, I'm accessible
all the time right by phone,
right by e?mail.
Are you making them
a firm offer, Lori?
Cuban: That's a different type
of accessible, right?
Yeah, I'm making
the same offer.
It's about going out there,
and...
?Ooh.
?So you have a choice.
?Yes.
?You've got two Sharks.
Greiner: You do.
Same offer.
Either of you guys
do 20%?
?No.
?No.
Cuban: There's got
to be enough there.
What if we put a royalty
in there?
Hey!
[ Laughs ]
Now you're talking.
You know what?
Look, how much of a royalty
would you pay?
Would you be interested
in doing a $100 royalty?
Sure. All right,
if you want 20%, $100 royalty.
Done.
[ Laughs ]
Wow, same offer.
You guys want
to go in together?
No.
?Nope?
?Okay.
Whoa, you boys have to make
a decision.
Just asking.
Look, again,
there's a difference
between being available
on the phone.
Again, not taking anything away
from Lori.
She's great.
Greiner: What do you mean
I'm not available
on the phone?
No, no.
I'm available all the time
for my entrepreneurs.
There's a difference between
being available on the phone...
Who would've thought?
You roll in here
with a telescoping crypt,
and you got two offers.
...going up to see somebody,
and going out
and making appearances
right in the area that matters.
Yeah.
Right.
Cuban:
That's the difference.
Listen, all I can tell you is,
is I know what I do.
All right, Levi,
what are you gonna do?
Tough decision.
He has 51%, so...
Honestly, the 25%'s
a better deal for you
than a royalty,
because it's
a cash?heavy business.
Levi,
there's a tornado coming.
Mark said he was gonna
finance the P. O. s?
Cuban: Yeah.
Listen, I'm always happy
to finance purchase orders.
There's nothing better
on earth...
Okay.
...to put your money
towards.
Levi,
these are good offers.
?They are. They are.
?I've made over 700 products.
Don't let it slip away.
My phone is ringing.
Alert! Alert! There's a tornado
coming down the hall!
Yo, man, you got
to make a decision.
Todd: It's been
a huge opportunity
to be on the "Shark Tank,"
and we're getting ready
to take a quantum leap.
With Mark's help, this thing's
gonna grow big very fast,
and I think America's
really gonna love it.
This is actually
pretty cool.
It's scary but cool.
Stay in there.
Okay, take it away.
Aaah!
Woman: Giving you the freedom
to wax anytime, anyplace.
Let's see
what they're up to now.
Frankel: It's good to have
both businesses together
because I feel like
we have similar goals.
Paschall:
Having Bethenny believe
in women empowerment so much
is very in?tune
with what our brand is,
what our message is.
Vasseghi: We're currently
working with Bethenny
on a women's solutions kit
like we talked about
in the Tank.
Bra strap holder.
Amazing.
We're creating this kit
to help women in a pinch,
so if there are traveling,
busy moms on the go,
there's always gonna
be something
that you're gonna need
out of this bag.
Instead
of going the gift angle,
this is really
a functional tea.
Williams:
The original line I pitched
on "Shark Tank"
was a little too edgy
for retailers,
so Bethenny and I
worked together
to create something
for a larger audience.
Frankel:
You're still snarky,
but you feel like you're
gonna get the function of it.
Right. Yep.
Frankel: They're hitting it
out of the park.
Combined,
these two businesses
are close to $3 million
since "Shark Tank."
I always send out
to different celebrities
and influencers
these Bethenny Boxes,
and I thought, why not
coordinate all of our products?
?It's like a confidence pack.
?It's so exciting.
?[ Laughs ]
?Exactly.
I work
with Dress for Success.
They help women
to get jobs.
So I thought that
this would be a great thing
to bring over to them,
so let's go over there
and surprise them
with some of these boxes.
Awesome, let's do it.
?Look who's here!
?How are you? Good to see you.
So great to see you.
Frankel: Dress for Success
is a nonprofit organization.
They provide development tools
and professional attire
to help women thrive.
We all have been struggling,
broke female entrepreneurs
that have succeeded.
To give back to an organization
like Dress for Success
is on brand.
And we're really excited
to announce
that we'll be donating
a portion of proceeds
from the new products
to Dress for Success.
The women from Snarky Tea
and No Mo had a dream,
and they went for it.
I totally relate to that,
and I want to show women
all around the world
you can achieve
the impossible.
The New England Journal
of Medicine estimated
that 57% of kids and teens
will be obese by the age of 35.
That's more than half
the population.
Well, you understand
the challenges here.
The greatest obesity levels
are with
lower?income households.
Right.
And you're
a premium product.
It's 33% more expensive.
All right,
SubSafe is the ultimate
sandwich container
and so much more.
It's BPA free,
made from
high?quality plastic,
making it waterproof,
crush?proof, and it floats.
SubSafe comes
with three pieces
to protect either a 6?inch sub
or a 12?inch sub.
You simply put the sub
in the container,
put it on, lock it tight,
throw it in the cooler,
and rest assured
your sub is safe.
SubSafe is not only
for boating.
Tailgating, camping, hunting,
racing, beach days ??
you name it,
we got you covered.
White, wheat, or rye ??
it all stays dry.
[ Laughter ]
Mr. Wonderful,
don't be an old fogy.
Protect your hoagie.
[ Laughs ]
Oh!         Oh!
Oh!                          Oh!
Barkley: Well, I caught a marlin
one time.
And it was stupid, 'cause
I wrastled with this damn thing
for like three hours,
and you couldn't eat it.
[ Laughter ]
I was so pissed.
I cannot believe
this happened.
You did amazing.
I can't believe
you did that.
Turning something from an idea
into a manufactured product
that people now believe in
is just the dream come true.
It's the ultimate dream.
absorbs up to eight times
as much shoe odor
as the next
leading competitor.
How long does it last
before it has to be replaced?
It lasts for approximately
two months
or we say
up to 60 wears.
Over what time?
Since we launched
in July of 2017.
?All right.
?What size shoe do you wear?
9.5 ??
I have smaller feet.
All right, you wear a 9.5.
I wear a 17.
?Whoa!
?Almost double my size.
?How is that ??
?17?!
That is
truly miraculous.
Oh, my God.
How is ??
We can use one pad a piece?
Yes.
He needs seven.
Yes.
No. He's gonna need more,
right?
You know, to be honest,
we haven't tested them
on a size 17 foot before,
so we should do that.
And you'd probably need to
with his. It's like...
Do you have a patent?
So, we have a provisional patent
on the product itself.
Third?party tes??
Do you buy your material
from someone else...
We do.
...or did you create it?
We buy it
from somebody else.
So it's already
out there...
Oh, so you didn't
create this.
...and someone else ??
We don't manufacture
the material, no,
but the patent is
on the construction
of the fabric
and the actual product.
Smith: Yes.
Right, and what do you need
the money for today?
So, two main things ??
marketing and sales.
So, obviously right now,
we are building a brand,
so we want
to invest more there.
Why did you choose spending
your $150,000 on branding?
Why make that choice?
The growth of this business
we do truly believe
will be through retail,
and so we think
by getting into retail,
you naturally are getting
all of the eyeballs
of anyone going
into that market ??
But ??
But you only raised $100??
You're only asking here
$150,000, right?
Yes.
That's not a lot
relative to building
even a local brand.
We have an incredible pitch
for retailers, right?
We're saying...
What's the pitch?
...we can bring 40%
new customers
to that aisle for you.
Oh!
Okay, so, guys, look.
Absolutely.
Harvard Business School
ruined you guys.
I'm out.
?Aw, that's ??
?Ouch.
?Oh.
?That's a little brutal.
Nobody has foot traffic
to their odor products
in traditional retail
and big?box retail,
so where are you gonna spend
your money
to create a brand
and drive traffic
where nobody is interested
and nobody goes?
That's why I'm out.
Greiner:
So, here's my thought.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
So am I, by the way.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
I like this a lot.
Um, quiet.
You guys know.
My secret sauce
is getting product out there
at lightning speed
selling hundreds of thousands ??
perfect demonstrable,
right?
That's my thing.
It's what I've been doing
for 20 years.
I've made a lot of people
millionaires.
But I also have to know
that something works,
so I'm gonna do this
contingent
'cause I care about
my customers.
Oh, a contingency.
So, here's gonna be
the contingency.
Very bad. Very bad.
I'm gonna bring Charles in,
and I'll tell you why.
Herjavec:
'Cause he has big feet?
Any man that has
a 17?sized shoe, right?
That's a great demo.
Well, Charles?
Right? Yeah.
So Charles could come with me
on QVC.
We'll do the testing
with Charles' shoe...
Smith: Yeah.
...at that third?party lab,
and we'll see.
Well, first of all, uh,
I love the idea,
uh, so, Lori, I would love
to work with you.
We'll give you the $150,000,
but I think we need 30%.
Ha, oh!
Giving up 30% is crazy
at this point.
Herjavec: Crazy!
No, it's not,
if we make you millions.
So, here's my offer.
I like QVC.
I'm launching BenjiLock
on there.
I sell millions of dollars
of product on QVC.
It's wine
that turns to vinegar.
And frankly ??
And anybody can get on QVC
with a good product.
It has to go through testing
as all my products do.
I like this product
because it can be extended
to other areas.
I'm gonna do the deal,
$150,000 for 20%.
Ooh.
And I think that puts
a little pressure
on everybody else
because I'll focus ??
Not really.
My team will blow
this thing up huge for you.
?Well, here's the thing.
?And I like the extension.
Would you rather take 20%
and make hundreds,
or 30%
and make millions?
I make millionaires
out of all my deals.
?No, you don't.
?All of them.
By the way, congratulations,
you have two offers.
Well, maybe you have
three offers.
Do I give you
a better offer?
Because Lori's offer
is awful.
Robert, she's got me
this time, though.
Greiner: That's right.
I like the idea
of a celebrity endorsement,
but perhaps we can carve out
some of that equity
for somebody
down the road.
I'm sure there are people
who are smellier than Charles,
with all due respect.
[ Laughs ]
I will do the $150,000
for...
I'll match Kevin's offer ??
20%.
I'm gonna go on television,
advertise your product,
and I'm a lot more expensive
than $150,000, in fairness.
Herjavec: And I think you're not
gonna give up that equity.
I think you're too smart
to fall in for this.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you the $150,000
for 12%.
Could you match
their 20%?
The original 20%?
Charles?
Lori, I'm with you,
ride or die.
?Okay.
?I told you that.
So, is that yes?
If you take the 20%,
we would take it...
Guys.
...and that's, like,
coming in at a 12% and a 15%.
?Split the difference?
?We definitely see ??
22.5%.
Still too much.
I think the 20%
would be perfect.
Greiner: It's okay.
You know what?
?Gonna go out.
?Okay, we can...
Probably am gonna go out.
