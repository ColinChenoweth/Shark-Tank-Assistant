fun with the kids
a few times a year,
but I don't see this
as something that
they're going to do every day,
even once a week.
And because of that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Herjavec: I think it's
an interesting idea.
I'm trying to figure out
whether I love it or not.
Here on "Shark Tank,"
we did invest
with a company
called PupBox,
a little box that
you get as a puppy.
And we sold that
for $2.5 million
within a short amount of time
to a big pet retailer.
People love their dogs.
I worry that
you're adding delay.
Like, I have to actually
bake it.
Oh, come on, Robert.
I don't think people are gonna
bake for their dogs.
I'm out.
Hi, Sharks. I'm Tim.
And I'm Kim.
We're high?school sweethearts
from the South Side of Chicago.
And we're seeking
$400,000
for a 10% equity stake
in our company...
Both: CurlMix.
Sharks, women want to feel
confident and beautiful
with their naturally
curly hair.
But they need safe curly hair
products that deliver results.
Flaxseed gel is
the best organic ingredient
for styling curly hair.
Flaxseed gel gives you
moisturized,
voluminous curls
that last,
but you can't quite get it
in stores.
You have to make it
yourself.
Until now.
We've revolutionized the way
people get flaxseed gel
by creating the best pure
flaxseed gel on the market.
Here's how it works.
Our pure flaxseed gel
smoothes away frizz,
adds tons of shine,
and enhances their natural
curl pattern.
Diffuse your curls,
and voilà.
On the other side, we have a
completed section, fully dried.
As you can see, these curls
have volume and bounce.
The best part is,
they don't have to apply
any more product
for the rest of the week.
And it works
on all curl sizes ??
wavy hair, curly hair,
super?curly hair...
Wow! [ Laughs ]
...and kinky hair.
All right, Sharks.
Both: Who's ready to get
in the mix with CurlMix?
This will give you guys a closer
look at each of our products.
We've prepared a bundle.
Cool.
So we have...
Okay.
...sports?car red
for you.
?Ooh.
?[ Laughs ]
For Lori,
we have a luscious lavender
'cause you're luscious.
Ooh.
For Kevin, we have
our hair?growth bundle.
[ Laughter ]
We know you need it.
All right.
And for Alli,
we got you
our Drybar yellow
with our lemon creme
fragrance.
Wow.
Thank you so much.
And then, of course, Mark ??
maverick blue.
Thanks, Tim.
Enjoy.
Herjavec: It's for people
with curly hair.
Yes.
Not to straighten it?
Correct.
Just to make it more curly?
To define their curls.
Absolutely.
However your hair looks
when it's wet and curly.
So, what would the hair look
like before and after?
So, this is their before.
Which side?
The le?? The right side.
This side here.
[ Laughing ] Really?
?You can't tell?
?Right?hand side.
So you'll see that
it's not really well?defined.
And it looks ??
How does it look different?
Webb: What?!
How does it look different?
You're such a guy.
?He's being funny.
?He's being funny.
?That's such a guy ??
?No, he's not! No, he's not.
?He's being serious.
?I'm being serious.
It's true, because most guys
don't understand, like ??
We don't pay attention
to the details.
?Which [Scoffs]
?Oh, wow.
You guys got to work
on that.
?Sorry. This is the before.
?Yeah.
And it's fluffy and ??
And it ?? Fluffy and frizzy,
and you see how the other side
is, like,
a more defined curl.
Like, you can actually
see the spiral?
?Ohh.
?Nice ringlets. Yes.
Webb: Yeah, it's so much
more defined, Robert.
You're like,
"Ooh, big whoop."
?[ Laughing ] Okay.
?Ooh.
But is this a big problem?
?Yes.
?Absolutely.
Hello. Drybar.
Yes. There is a problem.
[ Both laugh ]
There is a huge market for women
who want their natural curls.
I have naturally curly hair,
too, but not this curly.
So do I.
Did.
And if you want to go
with your natural curls,
you need something that makes
your hair look like pretty ??
And so, what's the big deal
about flaxseed oil?
If you look online,
you'll find thousands of women
making their own
flaxseed gel at home.
Tim: If you're making it
at home,
it's ridiculously tough
to preserve.
It lasts two or three days
unless you freeze it.
And so we developed a method
to make flaxseed gel at scale.
We launched it in
a couple test batches.
We sold out
almost instantly,
and this is a month
after she gave birth.
Superwoman.
[ Greiner laughs ]
What are your sales?
Year to date,
we've done $400,000
in just these last
nine months.
?Congratulations.
?That's real money.
Are you guys beauticians?
I mean, what is your background?
We first got into the industry
five years ago.
We were
fresh out of college.
My wife hated her job,
so then she's a hustler.
And I was
a business major,
so I majored in Marketing
and Supply Chain Management.
Yes.
And so she wanted to pursue
entrepreneurship.
We didn't have the money
at the time,
so she booked me on
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"
?[ Laughs ]
?No way.
I got on that show.
I won $100,000.
[ Cheering ]
[ Laughs ]
And then we used that
to invest in our first business.
?Come on!
?Yeah. It was ??
?That is hard. I just did that.
?I know. That's amazing.
[ Laughs ]
What do you think you'll do
for the whole year in sales?
$1 million.
Yes.
?So we're on track to do
a million in sales.
?$1 million?
?And will you be profitable?
?Wow.
Yes, by the end
of the year.
We'll be cash?flow positive
in one month.
Wow.
In two months,
we'll be profitable.
And we're projecting $180,000
in profits this year.
Tim, you never told me
what it costs.
What does it sell for?
About $25.
The lowest bottle
is $25 to $28.
And what does it cost you
to make it?
So, it costs about $3 to make
a regular bottle of gel.
So you sell for $25,
you make it for $3.
Yes.
Yes.
I love you so much.
And with an investment,
we can cut that in half.
[ Laughs ]
And what do you need
the money for?
What are you gonna do
with the $400,000?
The main issue we have now
is we cannot keep products
on the shelves.
Yeah.
So we need ??
Don't you hate
when that happens?
?[ Laughs ]
?It is. I ??
That's actually called
a champagne problem.
Every week, my goal is
to get off back order.
So right away, we need
to invest in inventory.
And we can also invest
in new equipment
'cause we can do this
even bigger.
We're making 700
in a batch.
With new equipment,
we can double, 10x that.
Webb: How are you gonna get
market share?
Mm?hmm.
I mean, I started
a product line myself that ??
there's a million
dry shampoos out there.
Right.
I believe ours is the best,
and there's reasons for that.
Of course.
But, like, what is it
for you guys
that makes yours different
and unique?
Our main competitor
is actually DevaCurl.
And how big are they?
Um...
Um, $100 million a year.
?Maybe ?? Maybe $200 million.
?Easy.
?Yeah. Easy.
?Robert, easy.
Wow.
Cuban: Guys, I'm gonna
simplify it.
I have no clue
what you're talking about.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Understood.
Thank you very much.
So, I love this business
because the margins are crazy,
but there's a reason
for that.
?Yeah.
?Mm?hmm.
It's brutally competitive,
and you need that margin
to buy the brand
and the marketing.
Are you gonna need
a massive push
in the market
to buy brand?
Mm?hmm.
Well, not only that. You need
massive infrastructure, too.
Right.
Because I know personally
how hard it is
to start a product line.
Now we have, like,
a team of, like,
I don't know,
30 people,
that if you really want
to compete with the big guys...
Yeah.
...the DevaCurls of the world,
like, you have to put
a lot of infrastructure
in place,
and frankly, $400,000 ??
?Yeah, see, I ?? I ??
?It's not gonna do it.
This is one of the few
investments that I think,
if I give you $400,000,
you're definitely gonna grow
and you're gonna
get bigger.
Mm?hmm.
What I worry about is,
the car goes faster
and then hits a wall.
?Yeah.
?Mm.
And so,
for those other brands,
a lot of them think
retail first,
and that's not
our strategy.
Our strategy is
to stay online right now
because our margins
are so big.
Well, you don't have
any other choice
because you're not gonna get
any retail space.
That's a point.
The problem with
high?margin products
is the guys
that own that space
protect it
as if they're warriors.
Mm?hmm.
They don't give up
one single inch.
When they get competition ??
But could you get
an inch out of them?
Well, they ?? they buy their
space. They maintain.
He has no hair.
You don't have the power?
You have the power to do it.
Yes.
I know you do.
There's no way
this business is worth
$4 million right now.
There's nothing proprietary
about taking flaxseed
and boiling it,
so if this works
and you get to
$50 million in sales,
some guy that's doing
$2 billion is gonna say,
"Okay, boil some flaxseed.
Let's crush the CurlMix
cockroaches."
But we would obtain
extra money by then.
Maybe.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We appreciate that.
I am impressed that, without
being chemists or whatever,
you know, you went in
and you figured out
this extraction process.
I just don't know about
this space well enough
to know
how to compete up against
those major, major brands.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We appreciate the kind words.
Thank you so much.
So, I think you guys
are amazing.
Like, you have such,
like, charisma,
and I feel like you could
sell ice to an Eskimo.
I ?? I mean, I really ??
[ Laughs ]
I try.
You ?? I mean,
you guys are good.
I think there's
a good business here,
and I know from being in
the hair industry for 20 years
that this is a need,
unequivocally.
Yes.
There is a need for
this kind of product,
which maybe I'll put some
flaxseeds in stuff now.
Just kidding.
?Oh, shame on you.
Shame on you.
?Uh?oh.
?Flaxseed.
?You are a savage.
I'm a Shark!
I can't believe it.
Listen, I'm not stealing
anything. I promise.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm not in
the curly hair business.
I'm in the business
of making curly hair straight.
But, like Lori said,
you have a lot of competition
with a lot more infrastructure
and more money behind them.
Mm?hmm.
I think the space might
be too crowded,
so I'm out.
Yes.
O'Leary:
But it's not over yet.
Robert, who has problems
with his hair all the time ??
Herjavec: All right, you
know, I was on the fence.
Do you know what kind of
tipped me over?
What?
The queen of hair.
Ah.
I didn't know if there was
a need, but there's a need.
Yeah.
But I haven't invested
in this space.
It's very risky to me,
so I have to make you
a Sharky offer, which ??
that's why I'm a Shark.
Hmm.
Robert is Tim and Kim's
last chance
to make a deal for their
hair gel company, CurlMix.
I haven't invested
in the space.
It's very risky to me,
so I have to make you
a Sharky offer, which...
Let's hear it.
...that's why I'm a Shark.
I will give you
the $400,000...
I hear
a flaxseed royalty!
[ Laughter ]
No, no, no.
I don't want a royalty.
I'll do it for 20%.
Oh, that's nothing.
?That's a good offer.
?You should take that deal.
Yes.
I expected a lot worse
than that, guys.
Would you consider 15%?
I would not.
Sharky deal.
?I would not.
?It's a good offer, though,
because that money
will really help you.
I'm ?? I'm ??
So, Robert, um,
I understand that you see
that there's risk
in the business.
We appreciate that.
I do.
We are going to grow,
but we also see ourselves
as kind of the next
billion?dollar beauty brand.
Yeah.
We aren't just going
to stay in flaxseed.
We aren't just gonna stay
in curly hair.
You guys
will figure it out.
I mean, that's what great
entrepreneurs do, is they pivot.
Mm?hmm.
But it's risky for me
as an investor today, right?
Like, I'm buying
part of the future,
but I ?? I'm buying
what I see today.
Well, when we came up
with our valuation,
we did last month's sales
and we multiplied it by 12.
Like, if we didn't
grow at all,
we would make $115,000
for the next 12 months.
Kim...
So we actually ended up with
a $6.9 million valuation,
but we brought it down
to $4 million.
'Cause we really
wanted a Shark.
Oh. Hey, I can work
a spreadsheet, too.
We'll need a lot of money,
so we will probably
have to raise again.
Yes, which is why
I need 20% today.
Greiner: And you're
getting a Shark.
Kim: CurlMix is going to have
a massive launch in retail
and be the next billion?dollar
hair?care company.
The Sharks absolutely missed out
on a huge deal.
We could've 10x'd their money
in a year,
could've 100x'd their money
in two years,
and they really,
really are gonna hate
missing out on that deal.
Why didn't Alli do it?
What? Who? Alli?
Why didn't you
do this deal?
I am in the business
of turning curly straight.
What you're really saying is,
you hate women with curly hair.
It's the opposite.
Oh, my God, no.
That's what I heard.
The truth is,
you can do it yourself
for less than $400,000.
Admit the truth.
That's not ??
It'll set yourself free.
[ Laughter ]
Congratulations, "Shark Tank,"
on a decade of dreams
from the Alice's Table team.
Thank you for bringing us
all together.
[ Cheering ]
But sometimes that downward dog
gets downright boring.
And that's why we created
our company.
[ Chuckles ]
Introducing
GOGA Goat Yoga.
[ Goat bleats ]
Oh!
Aww!
They're so cute!
[ Goats bleating ]
Baa!
[ Goat bleats ]
Baa!
Oh, my God.
I want to touch one.
Oh, my God.
Hi, guys.
GOGA Goat Yoga
is exactly like yoga,
but with baby goats.
What?
Now, I'm sure you're asking
yourselves, "Why goats?"
Yes. Why goats?
Goats naturally like
to play King of the Hill,
so while you're in
that downward dog ?? boom ??
a goat jumps on your back.
[ Goat bleating ]
They also enjoy snuggling up
on yogis' mats
once they get tired.
Or sometimes they'll
come up and give you
a nice little head bump
to say, "Keep going."
GOGA is great for team building,
bachelorette parties,
or just a fun, relaxing workout
after a long week.
Now, who wants to grab a mat
and come try GOGA?
?Me!
?Yes!
?Come on.
?For sure!
?Ohh.
?[ Laughs ]
?You guys want to say hi?
?I want to hold one.
Okay, grab a mat.
We're gonna face this way.
Start on your hands and knees
in a tabletop pose.
?Tabletop.
?Okay, you can set him down.
Yep.
[ Goat bleats ]
Hey.
Here's your buddy.
[ Laughs ]
So, you want to have a nice,
strong back in this pose
so that the goats have
a stable surface.
Is there a goat on my back?
?There sure is.
?Oh!
The goat bit me!
[ Laughs ]
Try to come up
into a plank pose.
There you go.
Oh, my God.
That's good, Robert.
If you can, push up into
a downward?facing dog.
There you go.
How does it feel?
There's a goat on my back.
[ Laughter ]
That's what it feels like.
We want to do a couple
of standing poses,
if you're up for it.
So, grab a little goat.
?Give me the goat.
?Here's Scarlet.
See if you can balance
on your left foot
and then just bring your
right foot into a tree pose.
So, um...
?Good, Robert.
?That works, too.
Now take some nice
deep breaths
while you're holding
this little...
All right,
I think we get it.
?This is so much fun.
?It's Goat Yoga.
?Good job.
?I'm taking my goat.
?Yeah, here we go.
?You can take this one.
All right.
?I love this little goat.
?Let the goat go, Lori.
Run free, young goat.
Run free!
?Interesting concept.
?Is this a real thing?
So a lot of the times, we have
people come to our classes
and say, "This is exactly
what I needed
after a stressful week,"
or, "I just had
a death in the family,
and this really helped me
cope with that."
So, a little story
for you, here.
?Oh, Lord.
?Oh, no!
There's a supplementary
income stream available.
Let me explain it.
Oh, no.
I lived on the island of Cyprus
when I was young.
There's a mountain range
on Cyprus
called the Troodos Mountains,
and it's a tradition
for the Cypriot people
to go up on Sunday
up into the mountains
and take a baby goat,
slaughter it,
and barbecue it.
And I got to
tell you something.
Greiner: Oh, Kevin!
Of all of the things
I've eaten on barbecue,
nothing is as good as goat.
These goats are not a good breed
for meat or for milk.
Are you sure?
They're strictly for pets.
Positive.
Okay, so, guys, how often
do you teach classes?
What do you charge?
Do you have a space
that you're doing this in?
Like, where do you
keep the goats?
We do. Well, we started at
the top of the parking garage
where I lived
in downtown Austin.
We now have one studio
that's sort of
more of a temporary thing.
We, um, use it in exchange
for the foot traffic
that we bring in to the
other retailers in the area,
and then we also just secured
our second location.
Who's the yoga instructor?
We hire them.
Oh, you guys don't do it.
?No.
?No, we hire instructors.
The whole goat thing ??
like, I really love, like,
Pygmy goats ?? so cute ??
but at some point,
do you feel that
that wears off?
Absolutely.
So, we're already going into
now what we call phase 2.
We're gonna do full?time yoga
90% of the time,
and then we'll do the Goat Yoga
still every other weekend.
How much does it cost
to take a class?
Is it a different price
when there's a goat involved?
A regular yoga class is
typically from $20 to $25.
Goat Yoga
is $30 a person.
We also do a lot
of private events,
so for those, we charge
$40 a person.
I get it, because I think
animals really bring out
the best in people...
Sure.
...but it feels
very gimmicky.
It is
somewhat of a novelty.
People love to do it,
but a lot of those people
who come have never
done yoga before,
and so it's a great
introduction to them.
It's getting them
in the door.
They come to our studio,
the goats are the ice breaker,
then they want to sign up
for a membership.
?How long a period of time?
?Yeah, how long?
Um, I ??
really, since November.
Where and how
did you sell that?
We ?? Like I said,
we do obstacle?course races
all over the world.
So you took these to
obstacle?course races?
I did.
I started selling them
from our rolling?cart
bucket thing.
Okay.
What did you do
before this?
I ??
It's kind of a strange ??
I've always been
an entrepreneur.
We used ??
We wouldn't expect anything
strange from you guys.
Never.
No.
We do strange. We own that
Hula?Hoop space of strange.
I love that space.
Um, we've always been
entrepreneurs.
We actually had a home?building
business in Atlanta,
and the market tanked.
Um, I used to show horses,
and so, for the last 10 years,
I've been a broker
for high?end sport horses.
What are you
selling it for?
My retail price is $34.95.
That's all?
My wholesale is $16.
And what does it cost you
to make one?
$2.85.
?Yeah, baby!
?Whoa!
?I love the margin!
Greiner: So, you figured this
whole thing out yourself.
Oh, boy, did I.
Yes, I don't sleep.
'cause I think all the time.
It's just all I do.
I didn't plan on ??
I imported horses,
for crying out loud.
Like, a retail product?
But it ?? it's just evolved
so organically,
and it's actually helped
a ton of people,
and I don't mean,
like, it saved the world.
That's not my point.
My point is,
when you're done doing
whatever it is you're doing,
you can go to dinner.
You go to the beach, you don't
have to drive 30 minutes
back to your beach house.
Like, you're clean.
I mean, it's just ??
No, I get that.
I mean, listen,
I feel like that's ??
I said the exact same thing
when I started Drybar.
We're not
changing the world.
Right.
But it turns out we are,
and I always say that ??
Now <i>I'm</i> gonna cry.
[ Laughter ]
You know, it's like,
we're making women feel
really good about themselves.
Right.
And so ?? Ugh.
I can relate.
[ Laughing ]
What is wrong with me?
There is a part to this
that I haven't gone into
that I really want to do,
and that is disaster relief,
and I actually have
a contact at FEMA,
and the statistics say most of
the deaths from disaster relief
are not from
the actual disaster.
They're from hygiene
and infection afterwards.
I'm from Houston originally.
During the hurricane,
I had so many friends out there.
They were in their same clothes
for days.
I'll give you 30 seconds.
His time's up.
Is his 30 seconds over?
?It's gone.
?I'm still out.
Um, I ?? Listen,
I don't see why you need
to take on an investor.
You make a great margin.
Mm?hmm.
You're out there selling it.
You're pounding down doors.
Um, not often do I say it,
but in this circumstance,
I wouldn't take on
an investor.
I wouldn't want to invest in
your company for those reasons,
and so I'm out.
You're gonna get
a time?out.
?Am I gonna get a time?out?
?No.
