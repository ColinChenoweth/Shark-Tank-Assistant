Simon: Zookies Cookies are
the most delicious treats
you have ever had.
...and chasing their dreams.
Woman: Introducing Goat Yoga.
[ Goat bleats ]
Oh, Lord.
What?
Narrator: And tonight,
Alli Webb, the founder
of the beauty powerhouse
the Drybar, joins the Tank.
From being in the hair industry
for 20 years,
I think there's
a good business here.
What are your sales?
?$40,000 in sales.
Welcome to "Shark Tank."
We cannot keep products
on the shelf.
I'm willing to make you
an offer.
No!
It's like the first day
of school.
Kevin's the guy
who pulls your hair.
[ Chuckles ]
I believe that.
Hi. I'm Justin Miller.
And I'm Tom Simon.
And we're from Raleigh,
North Carolina.
We're here today seeking
$50,000 in exchange
for 20% equity in our company,
Zookies Cookies.
Zookies.
Sharks, what you have
in front of you today
are the best bake?at?home
cookies on the market.
Our peanut butter cookies
are 100% plant?based,
100% gluten?free,
no added preservatives,
and no added sugar.
Zookies Cookies are
the easiest, most delicious,
home?baked treats
you have ever had.
Trust us.
I had a fair share.
[ Chuckles ]
In front of you,
we've handed out
a few samples
for you guys to try,
and...bon appétit.
Cheers.
some of our happiest
customers...
Herjavec: I knew it.
Damn it!
I always get fooled!
...to show you how much they
love Zookies Cookies.
You do, Robert.
Send in Arthur, Benny,
and Charlie.
?Aww.
?[ Chuckles ]
It's like humans can eat it,
dogs can eat it.
?Yeah.
?Aww.
?And you just did.
Yeah.
Welcome to "Shark Tank."
?Oh, my God.
?Damn it.
?They are so cute.
?Hi, buddy. Hi.
?Hi.
?Come to me.
[ Barks ]
[ Chuckles ]
Looks like your dog.
Well, they like it.
[ Laughter ]
Miller: That's right, Sharks.
What you just had in front
of you is the finest
and most delicious dog treat
on the market.
Zookies Cookies are so easy,
even Justin can make them.
Pour jar into the bowl,
add water,
bake for 30 minutes,
and that's it.
Bake?
Zookies Cookies
is a new breed of treat,
one that
you can feel great
about giving
your best fur friend.
So, Sharks, who's ready to mix,
bake, and tail shake?
?[ Chuckles ]
?So many questions.
?Just to be clear,
I have to cook the cookie
in my home
before I give it
to the dog?
That's right. This is really
about the experience
and the quality
of the product.
You could eat the treats
with your dog.
And we see that
with families ??
Well...
?No, you can't.
?Nobody likes...
[ Laughter ]
Webb: I don't know.
That ?? That ?? Eh.
And I'd say ??
Yeah, right.
Actually, the dog handlers,
if you guys ?? We're good.
?No.
?Aww.
?Bye.
?Bye. Bye, guys.
?No.
?Bye, dogs.
If you had put
a dog in my lap,
I would definitely
have invested.
Oh.
Benny, come on back.
[ Laughter ]
Can I see the bottle?
?Mm?hmm.
?Sure.
My brother, who is, like,
obsessed with his dog,
you can't believe
what he does for his dog.
You are not going to cook
cookies for your dog.
I kind of like baking, even
though I'm not very good at it.
I just kind of like
the process.
I'm getting it's a cleaner
treat for your dog.
?Right, right.
?But aren't there a lot of
treats that are already
made that do it, too?
?Yes.
?The beautiful thing
about this product is every
one of our ingredients
are stuff that you and I
would eat anyway.
There's no "dog" ingredients
in here.
When we were looking at all
of the great treat varieties
that are
on the shelves today,
the problem was, even the treats
that are branded as healthy
still had some problematic
preservatives or things in them.
And ??
They don't say that.
They say they're healthy.
Of course.
So when you look at
our ingredients ??
I think I'm worried
you're going to zero.
You know that?
The proof is in their sales.
Tell us about your sales.
Yeah. Yeah.
So far, we've done
just over $40,000 in sales
just over nine months.
?And that's online or...
?Online.
Uh, a very minimal amount
of retail testing...
?Right.
?...but ?? but primarily online.
And how are you getting
your customers right now?
Direct targeting on Facebook,
uh, some Instagram,
and some Google.
O'Leary: What does this
cost me to buy?
So,
our jars are $9.99,
and we sell a three?pack
for $24.99.
And it costs you
to make a jar...
?Uh, just under $2.
?Yeah.
?Oh, a great margin.
?So...
What are you hoping in a year
from now sales will be?
I think we can get into the
mid?six figures a year in sales.
What we see happening is,
this is a very giftable product.
Over half of our sales
are gifts.
Cuban: Interesting.
What exactly do you think
you need help with?
We came here seeking
a strategic partner
more so than the capital
because we feel that there's
a big opportunity
with what we've created.
What we want to look at is
opportunities with big?box
and also opportunities to expand
out on those social channels.
Give me an example.
Which pet big?boxes?
When we look at ??
at pet stores,
I think that there is
an opportunity,
although it's a pretty
saturated market.
I think this is also
perfect to sit
on health food stores for humans
to coincide with that.
Like a Whole Foods.
I think this is a really
nice component ??
It doesn't tell me on
the packaging that I bake...
Herjavec: You think we can
get to Whole Foods?
...this is basically
a baking kit.
It doesn't tell me
what it is.
?Yeah.
?I mean, it's not clear to me
when I see this that ??
Webb: No, but I think
you're right,
because it does look like,
what do you do with this?
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
I think you need to be ?? If
there's one thing I've learned,
you know, is, from
our branding at Drybar...
?Yeah.
?...the importance of hierarchy.
I don't know what
to look at first.
So, if I say to you,
I don't think
it's gonna sell as?is...
Simon: Mm?hmm.
...are you willing to, like,
make some changes?
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
I mean, we've made changes
along the way
based on feedback
that we've seen.
We changed labels
a little bit.
Let me share with you guys
my thought.
It's a cute idea.
I see it more as a novelty
product that they'll do
in Tom and Justin's dog biscuit
mix, Zookies Cookies.
You know, I think I can bring
value in helping you get
into certain retailers
and with gifting.
So I'm willing
to make you an offer.
Oh, my goodness.
50k for 30%.
?Well.
?That's an offer.
Here's my offer.
I have a lot
of gifting companies
that do millions of dollars
in sales.
Maybe there's a way to work
you guys into that portfolio.
I will offer you
the $50,000 for 33.3%
so I'm an equal dog partner.
Oh, my God.
A little bit more than Alli,
but I bring way more value.
But I don't even think
you like dogs.
I love dogs.
I love selling ??
You don't ?? You've ??
?He hates dogs.
?He likes money.
Alli, you do not speak
Chihuahua. I do.
Do you guys have
any other partners?
I have a Chihuahua, and I want
to bake these for my dog.
I just like you guys.
I think the idea is really dumb,
but I like you guys.
You guys are great.
You see, I made you
a great offer.
I don't think
the idea is dumb.
And she will redo
your entire company.
I think there's some real value.
Let's ??
You know, I'm ?? This offer
isn't gonna be here forever.
?Ooh.
?Right.
I'd love to hear from Mark,
and I appreciate ??
Yeah, guys.
Look, I heard the word "bake,"
and I didn't understand
the rest of it.
[ Laughs ]
?If you want to talk tech...
?You're like...
But I'm out.
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
Well, you have
two solid offers.
I would have
never thought that.
At least one solid offer.
Webb: One who has hair.
I want 3.3% more
because I'm worth it.
Oh. Oh!
In all seriousness,
I ??
You know, I really see
an opportunity here.
Simon: Having Alli as part
of this now will be great
because her products
are already well?branded.
We've been talking about
repackaging and new
styles and new things,
and so having her as a partner
just feels fantastic.
Who is gonna bake
for their dog?
I'm telling you, people are ??
Like, my ??
You are not!
Yes, I am. So ??
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
?Yeah, she will.
?People will bake.
I will legit bake these
for my dog.
I'm very proud of you.
I'm very proud of you.
You were savage there. 30%.
?I know. That is savagery.
?That's so greedy.
Hey, they said "Yes."
Yeah, but they know that
she's going to help them.
Listen. I would not have done
this if I didn't believe in it.
Get a blow?dry.
Get some cookie dough.
You wanted it, too.
I think I was
a little bit of a tomboy
until I discovered, like,
I was obsessed with my hair.
My parents were entrepreneurs.
They've had a clothing store
called Flip's.
And my dad was such a genius
because he set up chairs
for the husbands to sit at,
and he would bring them
the newspaper
and coffee and bagels.
If the husbands were
comfortable and content,
they would let their wives
shop longer,
which means they would
buy more clothes.
It was, like, my first lesson
in customer service.
After high school,
I was very lost.
I really didn't know
what I wanted to do,
but I always wanted to go
to beauty school,
and my parents were
a little like,
"Really? Is that really
what you want to do?"
But I enrolled in beauty school,
and the first day,
I fell in love.
I was like,
"These are my people.
This is what I want to do."
I moved to New York City,
and I worked for John Sahag,
one of the most famous salons
in the city.
It was amazing. It was such
a great experience.
While I was living
in New York,
I got married and moved
to Los Angeles
and became a stay?at?home mom.
I loved being a stay?at?home
mom, but after a few years,
I got the itch
to get back out there
and do something for myself.
All of my mommy friends always
asked me to blow out their hair,
so I thought, "Let me start
this little side hustle,"
and I realized there was
a huge hole in the marketplace.
We opened the first Drybar
in 2010,
and literally, from Day 1,
we were booked solid,
and it just never let up.
Drybar is a place where
you go for just blowouts.
We wash your hair,
and then we style it,
all while you're sitting
at a bar,
watching a chick flick,
working on your laptop,
and when you're done, we twirl
you around for the big reveal
when you get to see
your camera?ready hair.
As women,
when our hair looks good,
we feel like we can
conquer the world.
We've grown Drybar
to over 100 locations.
We have a full product line
that's sold
in some major retailers
around the country.
We employ over 3,000 people.
I mean,
the business has expanded
well beyond my wildest dreams.
I feel like women and moms
in particular
make great business owners
because we're multitaskers.
I mean, women can handle a lot.
It's hard to balance,
but I think it's important
that women feel empowered,
that they can run
a great big business
and then still be a great mom
and just kind of
figure it out day by day.
I want to be a Shark because
I've had so many people
support me along the way that
I feel like I want to give back
and support other entrepreneurs.
I'm so excited to be able
to give some of the knowledge
and things that I've learned
building Drybar to somebody else
who's on the brink
of something really amazing.
