Hey, Sharks.
My name is Rachael Phillips.
And I'm Trey Kitchen.
And today we're seeking $50,000
for 15% of our company.
Sharks, we all know
the benefits of practicing yoga,
like increased strength,
flexibility, and mindfulness.
Kitchen: Yeah, we've been doing
it for about a year now.
We started right after
Hurricane Harvey. Uh...
Why? 'Cause you had
spare goats?
Yeah.
It was a fundraiser.
We had seen YouTube videos
of it, and we thought,
"Why not bring this
to Austin
to raise money
for Hurricane Harvey?"
His mother raises goats
and sells them as pets.
So, what is the benefit?
Why do you want a goat
standing on you?
[ Goat bleating ]
Animals naturally bring you
to the present,
and they are
very therapeutic.
Herjavec: Trey, do you have
any revenue?
Like, what are your sales?
Yeah. This year,
we've done $250,000.
Good for you.
And how much of it comes
from just the normal yoga?
We don't do
any regular yoga yet.
No, we just...
No, we've done
100% Goat Yoga.
So for a year ??
All that money was just
in Goat Yoga?
Yes.                   Yeah.
But that's awesome, guys.
You know what?
And that's with no AC,
no electricity, no bathrooms.
?Wow.
?Do you have competition?
It's popping up
all over the country now.
We have one competitor
in Austin.
What makes
your business different
than any of the other ones?
So, one thing is
our partnership
with Trey's mom, Roxie,
who gives us a constant supply
of baby goats.
The best goats.
A lot of people are doing it
with large goats,
so you've got a 100?pound goat
on your back with big horns.
They are.
We only use goats
that are this size.
That sounds scary.
Trey: We use only baby goats.
I definitely don't want
a goat with horns.
See, that would be cool.
They have over 200 goats.
My wife opened up a fitness
studio about a year ago.
It is a brutally hard
business.
The minute you get
dedicated office space,
your rent goes up,
you have fixed costs.
You've got to start
cycling more classes.
It feels a little gimmicky
to me,
because, really,
it's a yoga studio
that every now and then
has a goat.
Cuban: Right.
I can't get there with you.
I'm out.
So, a couple things
to your scaling ??
a lot of the other Goat Yogas
are not doing it near,
like,
the downtown area.
We're bringing the goats
into downtown ??
But that's not even really
the issue, right?
It's not like 80% of yoga,
uh, practitioners
are going to start doing
Goat Yoga.
I would suggest you keep it
on the rooftop,
because you can start
building your yoga studio
and then
maybe integrate in.
But it's a niche market,
and while you might be able
to open more than one,
it ?? then you're just
a yoga studio that
happens to have one angle,
and I don't see it as
an investable business,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
?Okay.
?I love this idea.
It's different and inventive,
but, for me, with Drybar,
I've been a professional
hairstylist for 20 years,
and I feel like that gave me
a very unique position
because we have
a ton of copycats
and a ton of competition.
A lot of those ??
those entrepreneurs
aren't hairstylists,
so they don't understand
the way the hair business
works.
Yeah.
So what makes me nervous
is the fact that, like,
you're not a yoga instructor.
A lot of girls I know
take yoga very seriously,
so I think you want to know
that it's coming from someone
who's, like,
obsessed with yoga.
It just doesn't feel right
to me, so I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
There's tons
of yoga studios,
and you've taken something
and made yourselves stand out.
I like the angle of it.
I think it's really clever
and cute,
but I don't feel this is
the right business for me.
Good luck,
but, unfortunately, I'm out.
Thank you.
But, Lori,
will you buy a goat?
You know, one day,
I might get a Pygmy goat.
Mom, you might be able
to make it.
Mom, do you ship?
?Ship a goat.
?She ships!
?Ship a goat.
?I'll tell you what.
I'll buy the goat.
You won't be seeing
that goat anymore.
No, don't sell to him.
No, we're not
selling goats to you.
Look, guys, I'd rather eat goat
than put it in my portfolio.
I'm out.
?All right.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
?Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Come on, girls.
?Come on. Let's go.
Oh, my God.
I truly would want one.

The little goats
are much more tender,
and it's all protein,
no fat.
We should be whacking
those guys.
There should be
no goats alive.
That's so horrible.
Alli, you could make
goat shampoo
and sell it in the store.
Cuban: Right?
