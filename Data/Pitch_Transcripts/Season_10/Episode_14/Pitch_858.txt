Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kressa,
and I am the inventor
of the Shower Toga.
I am here to offer
33% equity in my company
in exchange for $80,000.
Here to help me introduce
my product is my son, Conner,
my daughter, Layla,
and my wonderful husband,
otherwise known
as the Dirty Fairy.
Sharks, my family loves
to do obstacle?course races.
You may know them better
as mud runs,
but do not make the mistake
of not thinking
that it's
a very serious sport.
When we are racing,
we are running and crawling
through mud, salt water,
sand, pond scum,
and then when we're finished,
maybe they give us
a group changing tent
and a water?hose station,
but it's not private,
and you cannot get clean
with your workout clothes on.
I looked everywhere
for a solution.
There was nothing,
and that's why I invented...
the Shower Toga!
?Ta?da!
?Ta?da!
The Shower Toga is
the absolute only solution
for getting dirty in public,
undressing your clothes...
Ah.
...rinsing off, getting
dried off, and re?dressed.
The Shower Toga is
for surfers, hikers,
bikers, music festivals.
So, who wants to
get naked in public
with the Shower Toga?
The Dirty Fairy
is super pumped
about handing samples
out to you guys.
Thank you.
I want to go
do mud racing now.
I didn't know
that was a thing.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Fairy.
Okay, so now,
as you can see,
Layla and Conner are fresh
and clean, but, hey,
Conner's going to pick up
a hot date.
Do you really think
he wants
all of his muddy crap
in his car?
No.
She's gonna think
he's a slob, right?
Not now, because his Shower Toga
acts as a duffel bag.
That's such a good idea!
?So...
?That is a good idea.
?Yes!
Is it a good idea?
Have you sold any?
Yes,
it's a great idea, Mom.
I have! I have.
I've sold $80,000 worth.
That's not bad.
How ?? What ??
How did you do that?
Kressa, isn't your competition
a garbage bag?
Herjavec: Kevin.
Oh, my gosh. That's like
saying that a balloon
is the same thing
as a condom.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, but if you ??
if you go ??
Why doesn't a garbage bag
do the same thing?
First of all, a garbage bag ??
you could step into it.
It's gonna tear.
You need space for your ??
Not the ones
that hold leaves.
They're, like, a buck,
2 bucks each.
No. I'm gonna
answer your question.
Well, they use garbage bags
at concerts.
I go to them.
People wear them.
Let her answer.
First of all, the ?? the side
openings on the Shower Toga
have also what's called
a welt pocket, okay,
and the reason for this
is because
if you just have slits on
the side, you're gapping.
You gap and bend over...
And you can see stuff!
Right, yes.
Thousands more people are using
garbage bags than this.
Kevin, to your point,
a garbage bag's gonna leak.
And in ?? Exactly!
The water's gonna
pour into it.
You're gonna get
completely wet.
No, it doesn't.
Well, yes, 'cause the
drawstring's not gonna stay dry.
Webb: But the other thing is,
did you notice?
I feel like men can do it
and wrap it around their waist
and pull their pants down
easily, but girls ??
Like, she had, like,
a sports bra on.
Right. And so,
here's the top here.
O'Leary: I just ??
Look, I don't want
to take any air
out of the
Shower Toga balloon,
but it works the same way,
costs 2 bucks.
Is your idea that the races
would sell them
or give them out?
Yes.
We actually just got
a PO from one of the largest ??
the fastest?growing
race companies.
How many did they order?
How big was the order?
Uh, 1,000 units.
So, have you sold it to
any s?? anybody besides
surfers or racers?
I actually had somebody
that e?mailed me.
She was a caregiver
for the elderly,
and she bought it...
Yeah.
...because her patients
didn't want
to get undressed
in front of her.
O'Leary: Oh.
Granny in a plastic bag?
Retirement community.
You're still on
the plastic?bag thing.
It's more dignity.
?Yeah.
?It's not a plastic bag.
O'Leary:
I love your energy.
You ?? You are
really aggressive.
It's fantastic.
Yeah, you are amazing.
But I don't like to invest
in products
where the competition's
a garbage bag
that costs 99 cents, okay?
[ Laughter ]
So, that's not exciting
for me. So, look.
You do a garbage bag.
I wish you the best, but there's
no way I'm doing this deal.
I'm out.
You know what? I'm gonna ??
I'm gonna do you a favor.
Cuban: Do him a favor.
I'm gonna give you
30 seconds to ??
to ?? to ?? you just sit,
and you think for 30 seconds.
30 seconds, man.
29...
Cuban: Kressa,
have you tried
to sell online at all?
We ?? I mean, we sell
a lot through our website.
But your website we ??
But our Amazon
just started recently.
And it's tougher, isn't it?
It is a lot tougher, yeah.
I quit my job in April.
I bought a truck,
and we rented out our house,
took them
to obstacle?course races,
and we sell them
from our fifth wheel.
What's a fifth wheel?
It's like
a big huge trailer,
and we live
in the fifth wheel.
Greiner: So, then
you travel around...
Yeah.
In the trailer.
...and you go from
show to show to show...
Right. Exactly.
...and that's your life.
You are so passionate
about this.
Yes.
I mean, what does this business
mean to you personally?
[ Sniffles ]
[ Laughing ] Crap.
[ Laughs ]
Sorry.
[ Sniffles ]
[ Voice breaking ]
Five years ago,
I, um, got breast cancer
[sniffles]
and I just needed
something to, like,
bury myself into
that made me not think,
Right.
Kressa, I love it.
?What are you doing, Robert?
?I think you're full of energy.
I think you have
an amazing family.
I think it's gonna
be challenging,
but if anybody is ever gonna
make a business out of this...
[ Laughs ]
...it's gonna be you.
But as an investment,
I'm not there.
I'm out.
I'm gonna give you
the same offer.
All right.
Kressa, I think you're
the perfect entrepreneur.
Thank you.
You took the idea,
you put in the work
to turn it into a product.
Yes.
Now, in terms
of selling it,
I think the name
needs to change.
It's got to be so that when
someone goes onto Amazon
or anyplace else online
that's going to sell this,
they know exactly
what you're doing.
It's like, yeah, immediate.
So, Alli and I love it.
[ Laughs ]
We do, and you remind me
of myself.
I feel like you're
a very strong entrepreneur.
You're clearly not
taking "No" for an answer.
You're not afraid
to stand up to these guys.
Like, I feel like ??
and put them in their place.
I'm not afraid of them.
I mean, but I think that
that's a really important thing
for women in business,
because you have to be able to,
like, sit in a room
full of men
who are telling you
your idea's not good and say,
"No,
it actually is good,"
and I think that
you have this fire.
So Mark and I are gonna
make you an offer.
Okay. Um...
$80,000 from the two of us,
but we need 40%
since you're getting
two for one.
?[ Sighs ]
?Wow.
They're not so nice now.
[ Chuckles ]
Remember about garbage bags.
They're free.
Oh, man.
?You're out, remember?
?Forget him, Kressa.
?Don't listen to him.
?That's right.
?I'd take that offer.
Yeah, just don't
focus on them.
Okay.
I'm just ?? You have no idea
how honored I am.
Like, just to be here...
So say "Yes."
I know I'm supposed to
negotiate, but I get two of you.
How do I negotiate
for that?
[ Voice breaking ]
You've got a deal.
Whoo!
[ Cheering ]
Greiner: Yay.
Aww.
Congratulations.
It's a garbage bag.
All that fairy dust
got sprinkled down.
?Guys, thank you. Thank you.
?Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
Even you, thank you.
Ahh!
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]
Ahh! [ Laughs ]
For everything I've given up,
I feel vindicated because they
believed in me and my product,
and that means more to me
than anything else.
?I love her.
?Love her.
She's amazing.
She's, like, so infectious.
Yes. Amazing.
Okay, now that she's gone,
you realize you bought
a garbage bag
with a string on it.
Oh!
You know what? Step in here.
I'm gonna pull a Houdini.
