Hi, Sharks. I'm Ben.
And I'm Jenn.
And we're co?founders
of Toybox.
We're asking
for $150,000
for a 5% stake
in our company.
When I was a kid,
I used to build cities
out of mud in my backyard.
And I used
to raid dumpsters
for parts to see what type
of crazy things I could build.
Kids have always had
a ton of potential
and a huge appetite
to create,
but often lack the opportunity
to build their vision.
So we've come up with
a more powerful way
for kids to build and design
toys the way the want to.
Introducing Toybox,
the first?of?its?kind 3?D
printer and creativity platform
built entirely
with kids in mind.
And with the Toybox app, you can
immediately start printing
with absolutely
no prior training.
So, how's it work?
Simply find the toy you want
and press print.
Toybox will instantly beam down
your toy and start printing.
And if you're feeling more
creative, you're in luck.
Welcome to the creator space
of the app.
Here, kids can design
and print their own toys.
So whether you're drawing
simple things
or designing
your own block buddies,
Toybox can fuel
your creative needs.
So, Sharks,
let's invest
in the next generation
of young minds
and turn this Toybox
into a money box.
And, of course,
we have samples.
Cool.
?Thank you.
?How cute.
?I got a lobster.
?Why a lobster for Daymond?
'Cause I used to work
at Red Lobster.
O'Leary: 'Cause he worked
at Red Lobster.
That's right.
?Oh!
And, Lori, we printed you
your own Scrub Daddy.
And, Mr. Wonderful,
we printed you
your one true love ??
a big bag of money.
And, Jamie, we printed you
a shout?out
to your
"Shark Tank" pitch ??
a cutout
of Kevin O'Leary.
And, Mark, we know you're super
involved in basketball,
so we gave you ??
You gave me a pumpkin?
?A big, orange ??
?Orange, yeah.
[ High?pitched voice ]
Oh, are you gonna give me
a license deal?
[ High?pitched voice ]
I'm offering you $600,000.
?[ Laughs ]
?So, anyways, guys,
tell us about your business.
Baltes: So, uh, we built
most of this company
on an $80,000
investment.
Total, we've raised
around $290,000.
Chin:
And the reason we were able
to build this product
with such
a small investment
was because we're experts
in software.
We've worked at Microsoft
as developers and engineers.
Uh, I personally worked
in data science.
Greiner:
So, this isn't unique
in that 3?D printers have been
out now for a while.
What's different is, is that
yours is specifically for toys.
And is it therefore smaller
and less expensive
than others
out there?
Yeah, so, we sell
this printer for $299,
which is definitely on the
cheapest end of 3?D printers.
What we do specially
for kids
is we combine
hardware and software
to make a really friendly
user experience.
So, we have right now
over 750 toys.
We add 7 to 10 toys
a week,
and then we are
always monitoring
what kids
are playing with,
and we adjust what we add
based off of that.
Yeah, the worry with toys
is that it gets, you know,
used a couple times
and then put away.
And at $299,
that's a big decision on a toy.
O'Leary: What are
your sales like?
So, right now, we're focusing
just on Internet sales ??
primarily sales
on our website.
We just started selling
in September.
We've done over $300,000
in sales since then,
and all we do
is advertise on Facebook.
Cuban: And what does it
cost you to make?
So, we buy this for $150,
we sell it for $299,
but there's nobody
on the market
that has this software
and hardware stack
that's so developed
for children.
Our biggest target demographic
is 6 to 9?year?olds.
And you can print toys
from famous media
like Disney,
Minecraft, Marvel,
LEGO,
all sorts of things.
Well, you have
to go license those.
I mean, that's ??
Right.
So, licensing is
a huge opportunity.
Imagine if a kid
could, you know,
print his own Minecraft world
on this printer.
We see this as a huge,
huge, huge opportunity.
How long did it take
to print this out?
And how many passes?
So, that one takes
about four hours,
maybe about
eight passes.
You see,
there's the problem.
The attention span of
a 6, 7, 8, or 9?year?old
is gonna be difficult,
and I can see
the first couple times
Mom or Dad or whoever
helping them,
and that's great.
But no kid that age
has that attention span,
and I think that's
too big a challenge,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
John:
So, guys, liability?wise,
I mean, you're dealing
with 7?year?olds.
I mean, when I was 7,
I would have easily held my ??
you know,
my parrot under there
to make some boots
for the parrot.
[ Laughter ]
You know, I'm just
a little afraid
of selling to a bunch of
6, 7, and 8?year?olds
where what can happen
will go wrong.
We do require
parental guidance, and ??
You can say that
all you want,
but no parent
is sitting there
for four hours with them
and that machine's running,
and I'm just a little
concerned about that,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
So, guys, you're a subset
of the toy business.
I mean, you really
have to find that parent
that's thinking,
"Investing $300 in my child's
imagination is a good thing,"
And I think that's cool,
but it's not everybody.
I like it, though, so
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I bring a lot of value
to this space.
That's the way I look at it.
But right now,
you're still at
the proof of concept.
You're basically
just starting out,
and I happen to think
licensing would help this,
and that's hard work.
I agree.
I'll give you
the $150,000 for 10%,
and the reason
I'm saying that
is that certain things
you want to do
will happen faster
with me driving this.
Greiner: So, I think that ??
O'Leary: Jenn and Ben...
Kids ??
...I want you to know something.
If she drops out,
that gives me
a lot more incentive
to get friskier.
You know that.
Right.
Because you're starting
to lose Sharks here,
and I made you
an offer.
I?I would ?? I would love
to hear your offer, Lori.
Okay, before I was
so rudely interrupted ??
Well, I'm just pointing out
a reality of the Shark Tank.
That's all.
[ Stammers ] Okay.
I was saying ??
I think products like this
are really great
because they inspire kids
to build and design and develop.
The problem I have is,
is I think that
the age group you're targeting
is a little bit too young.
If it was the next
age bracket up,
like, 8 to 13,
I would like it better
as an investment for me.
But because it's not,
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
She didn't have an offer,
but you still
have an offer,
but it's going to be
modified slightly.
I'm feeling
very frisky now.
I don't like it
when I make an offer
and you're still
listening to others.
You have to realize
I have flexibility, too.
Cuban: Yeah, Jamie,
make that happen.
...as an employee benefit,
right?
?I'm writing a note right now.
?Thank you!
?"Dear, Jeff..."
?Right!
John: Well, here's what
I think about it.
You know, Minka,
my daughter, she's 2 1/2.
She doesn't
give anybody a hug
unless they have
a gift with them,
and for her
to open an e?mail,
she probably just would
be like, "W?What is this?"
[ Laughter ]
So, um...
I love the fact that you're
teaching financial intelligence,
but I just don't think
this one's for me.
I'm out.
Okay, well,
thank you, Daymond.
But what we have seen
when we have done testing,
for the younger kids,
they have so much stuff
that Mom is tired of
answering the calls like,
"What should I get Minka?"
?Yeah, look,
aspirationally and goal?wise,
it makes perfect sense, right?
run by farmers to benefit
small family farms like mine.
I'm very excited for
the amazing things ahead.
Cheers.
To me,
this is my way of life.
This is my culture.
This is my family.
Whoo!
We have fought so hard
to stay on this land,
and we struggled.
