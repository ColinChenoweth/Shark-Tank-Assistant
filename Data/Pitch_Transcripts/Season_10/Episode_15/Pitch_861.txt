My name is Lucinda Cramsey.
I was born on a farm
and raised on a farm,
and I'm an eighth?generation
farmer.
When I was 11, my father died,
and that's when I really
started to understand
how difficult farming
really is.
[ Chickens clucking ]
Family farms are struggling,
and why?
We feed everybody.
Why is it that we put
the food on your table
and we can't put food
on our own tables?
I wanted to give farmers
the opportunity
to be financially independent
outside of big agriculture.
So I created my business,
Hi, there.
I'm Lucinda.
I'm an eighth?generation farmer
from La Belle, Missouri.
I'm also the founder
and head hen
at a company called Moink ??
moo plus oink.
[ Chuckles ]
I grew up
on a 1,500?acre farm
where, ironically enough,
it was hard to put food
on the table.
You see, family farms
are struggling,
being snuffed out
by big business.
With 4 companies
controlling over 80%
of the meat industry
here in the United States,
the little guys have been left
fighting for the scraps,
which is why we created Moink,
a meat?box
subscription company
that connects
tender?hearted carnivores
with high?quality,
ethically?sourced meats.
We offer grass?fed and
grass?finished beef and lamb,
pastured pork
and chicken,
wild?caught
Alaskan salmon.
Our boxes are
fully customizable.
Now, I 'spect we ought to get
to the meat of the matter.
[ Chuckles ]
I am here today
seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10% of Moink
from a Shark who is willing
to double as a pit bull
in our fight
for the family farm.
Oink, oink, who's ready
to get Moink'd?
?[ Chuckles ]
?All right, let's get Moink'd.
?Are there samples?
I'm gonna bring
the bacon to you.
I'm gonna get
some wine there, too?
I 'spect we are.
I couldn't get a job
as a waitress...
Thank you.
...so you're just gonna have
to work with me right here.
Thank you.
And what you're having
on your plate right here
is a rib eye...
?Thank you.
?...some bacon...
?Lucinda, while you're at it,
I want a white
and a red.
Well, that's good 'cause
you're getting both.
'Cause I want to try
the white with the chicken
and the red with the beef.
Well, it's not chicken.
It's pork.
I want the white anyway.
Just give it to me.
Okay.
[ Laughter ]
Look who wants
the moon over here.
Lord, have mercy.
You're coming in hot, Kevin.
?Thank you so much.
?You're welcome.
The pork is excellent.
All right.
Seasoned really nicely.
That is a really fine
piece of bacon.
Mmm.
How'd you come up
with this product?
Cramsey:
So, earlier, you heard me say
that I grew up
on a 1,500?acre farm.
What I didn't
expand on there
is that when I was 11,
my father took his own life.
?Oh, no.
?And so my mother was left
with six mouths to feed and
a farm she couldn't afford.
And so she had to work two jobs
to keep a roof over our head,
and, um, even though
we had all this land,
a lot of times
we were hungry.
It didn't make sense.
And as a result of that,
I really felt like
it was my life mission
to help small family farms
be independent
outside of big ag.
So, the first thing
I start doing, actually,
is doing
fruits and vegetables.
And I've got, like,
a little stand in this building.
And when my lease came up,
I told my customers,
"Look, I'm going
to deliver to you."
Well, that went over
really well,
and, um, a larger company
had said
that they were interested
in coming in and "helping" me.
So, I'm young, dumb, naive,
think the world is
full of wonderful people.
So I made a deal,
gave up 51% of my company,
and zero dollars
changed hands.
So, I learned
a very valuable lesson,
and three weeks later,
I decide I'm gonna sell to them
the rest of my 49%.
I go to my attorney's office,
and I've got, like,
manure on my boots,
my baby's got a dirty face,
like, all those things
you think about
in the sad stories, right?
And so I walk in,
and I said to him,
"You think I can get
$5,000 in cash?"
"Sure, Lucinda, why?"
I said, "Because...
for one day,
I want to feel like
I am not poor, white trash."
And so he said,
"Lucinda, don't let this
be the end of you.
Let it be the beginning."
My husband is a lot better
at raising pigs
than he is potatoes.
[ Chuckles ]
And so we realized
when we started
raising these hogs
that there was a demand.
And so we're talking to some
of our farmer friends
having the same situation,
and finally I went,
"Hey, let's do it
just like we did produce.
Set it up on a subscription box
and ship it to them."
And so that's how
we get Moink.
Tell us about the business,
and what are your sales?
In 2017, we did $85,000
worth of sales.
For 2018, year?to?date,
we did $730,000 in sales.
?Whoa.
?Big jump.
?We're cooking with gas.
?[ Chuckles ]
We have
a 71% retention rate.
Greiner: Wow.
And, Kevin, you're in
the subscription business.
I think you can, uh,
vouch for the fact
that's really good.
That is really good,
but how are you acquiring
the customer in the first place?
So, we do a lot of
inbound marketing right now.
Google people are looking
for this kind of meat,
pasture?raised pork.
That's getting your SEO search
and all the Internet stuff.
Yes, yes, right.
So, tell us more about
the numbers and the business.
Yeah, let's start with
customer?acquisition cost,
'cause I'm sure
y'all want to know that.
$97 for a holistic view.
And what I mean by that
is I put everything in there,
including what it costs
for me to pay
a marketing consultant.
What's their
average order?
So, all of
our boxes are $159.
What's the quantity
and the size?
Sure.
So, each box comes with
13 to 16 pounds.
The price per serving
is $4.50.
O'Leary:
I'm trying to figure out
how much you make
on the $730,000.
Yes.
Can you write it down?
'Cause I'm gonna
give the numbers,
and I know you like numbers.
?I'm ready.
Lucinda, I'm ready.
?$159,
and our cost is $127.
Greiner: Wait.
That's with
credit card charges ??
?Wait a minute.
?That's our box.
?$127?
?Yep, that's a 20% ??
?And you sell it for $159.
?Let's not get all ??
Is shipping
and handling free?
?Yes, it is.
?Ooh, that's bad for margins.
Everybody calm down. Calm down.
We're gonna get there.
So $127 includes
my credit card cost,
my shipping cost,
my box cost, everything.
That's still expensive.
Some of my bacon just
came back up. [ Laughs ]
?That is a very small margin.
?There's margin there, Lucinda.
There's no margin.
I understand what
you're saying to me.
Are you basically saying
you're netting 20%?
No, I net about 10%.
Oh, Lucinda!
Lucinda, you want me to give you
$250,000 for 10% ??
imputes a value
of $2.5 million.
Your business isn't worth
$2.5 million.
It's just not.
of Lucinda's ethical meat
subscription?box company, Moink.
O'Leary: Lucinda, I have no
problem with what you're doing,
and it's actually a great story
about perseverance.
I get it.
But your margins are
much less than the other players
in the direct?protein
marketing business.
Sure.
Omaha Steaks and all
the people underneath them
are making
twice what you make.
If you look at
what's in the box,
they put in other stuff
that's much lower cost.
Sure.
And so their margins
are much higher.
I understand that our margins
are not a lot,
but next year,
if we do $2.5 million ??
You're gonna make
500 grand.
Yeah.
About $380,000 after tax.
That would ??
I didn't come here today
to fight you about my valuation.
?No, I ??
?Look, let me tell you.
Do I think
it's worth more? Sure.
You're a force of nature,
Lucinda.
But I'm an investor.
But I also think
my husband's
the most handsome man
in the world.
Doesn't mean I'm willing
to go to war to prove it.
[ Laughs ]
So how about you
give me a number,
and we'll start there.
Lucinda, you know ??
I didn't come to fight you
about this.
Daymond, would you like
to have the floor?
So, I know you got screwed
the first time.
You're very sensitive
to partnerships.
Yeah.
However,
this is our first date...
Yeah.
...and you're
very defensive.
I don't want to get in your way.
I'm out.
You are really
a firecracker,
and I mean that
in a good way.
My issue is that I eat probably
60% to 70% vegetables.
Sure.
And the rest is
a lot of seafood.
Sure.
When I invest in something,
I feel like it has
to fit with me.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
Look, I have a deal
with Echo Valley Meats.
They've got subscriptions,
and they've got deliveries,
you know?
Congratulations on
what you've accomplished.
But it's just
not a fit for me...
Okay.
...with what I have,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
?Okay.
?Product's incredible.
Best bacon I've ever had,
but I'll tell you something.
Your margins
don't work.
I love the story,
but I'm an investor.
I got to make money.
?But the thing is ??
So, let's do
the numbers ??
Lucinda, you're talking
to a bunch of Sharks
that don't remember what
it's like to be little.
They want to invest
in big companies.
That's not true.
I remember
what it's like to be little.
Oh, you're so full of...
Are you kidding me?
Siminoff:
The margins you're talking about
are with big companies.
When I was up there,
my margins were terrible.
And as we grew...
The problem was not
your margins.
Your problem was what
you spent on advertising.
No, but as you grow,
you figure it out.
We can get to scale.
?Uh?huh.
You know, I invested in
a food company like this.
It's called Kite Hill,
and it's a specialized
cheese company,
and I did it 'cause
I could see the passion
behind the founders
of the company.
I see
the same thing here.
So here's my offer.
I'll give you $400,000
for 20% of the company.
He's giving you
more than you asked for.
Because I think you're actually
asking for too little.
I think we need to get this
to scale faster
to get those margins there.
?That's a heck of an offer.
But can we talk about ??
Listen, I wouldn't think about
that too long, Lucinda.
Kevin, I'm talking here.
Greiner: Let her think
for a minute, Kevin.
Can you just give me
a minute? Lord.
Okay, so, everything
in my business
has been based on
controlled growth.
I hit numbers
that I say I'm gonna hit.
If I need to put more gas
on something, I do.
If I need to whoa up
on something, I do,
because it's controlled
and calculated.
But now all of a sudden,
you're looking at
uncontrolled growth, right?
You want to be conservative.
We don't want ??
you grow too fast, you're
gonna blow up for sure.
Yeah.
The other side,
though, is
you're growing actually
pretty fast.
Yeah.
And you're gonna need some
infrastructure in place
to lower those margins
to make this a real business
for all of us,
which is why
I'm putting in
more money
than you're asking for,
because I think it's gonna take
some more money to get there.
I have just
one other question.
Are you gonna blow up
my phone a lot?
Is that, like ??
[ Laughter ]
I'm just ??
I am loving you more
and more by the minute.
Okay.
But we got to ??
All right,
let's get 'er done.
$400,000 for ??
Get 'er done.
[ Laughter ]
Deal.
?Oh, my God.
?Thank you.
?Congratulations, Lucinda.
?Thanks, Jamie.
Love it.
?Congratulations.
?We're gonna gonna rock it.
?Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
?Get Moink'd!
