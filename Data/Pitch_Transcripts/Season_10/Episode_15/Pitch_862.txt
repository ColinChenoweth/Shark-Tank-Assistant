My name is
Roger Anderson.
And I'm
Steve Berkson.
And we're here to tell you
all about
The Jolly Roger
Telephone Company.
We're seeking $400,000
for 10% equity
in our company.
Throughout history,
predators have tried
to sneak into our homes.
These strangers
don't use doors.
They don't use windows.
They use...
telephones.
Who are they?
They're...
telemarketers.
Last year alone,
they scammed Americans
out of $9.4 billion.
?Mm.
?I knew somebody had to do
something about this.
Having worked in telecom
my whole life,
I thought, "Perhaps I'm the guy
for the job."
So I hoisted my flag,
sailed the telecom seas,
and started The Jolly Roger
Telephone Company ??
the answering service
that fights back.
With our service,
telemarketers think
they're getting
exactly what they want ??
a long conversation
with a receptive,
gullible consumer.
But instead,
they're interacting
with humanlike robots ??
we call them pirates ??
specially designed
to keep scammers talking,
wasting their time, and
draining away their ability
to make any money.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
[ Cellphone beeps ]
?That's great.
?Nice.
Greiner: Wait, how do you know
when they call
to set off the robot
versus it's someone
you really want to talk to?
Very good question.
We use
a third?party service
that gives us a reputation score
for every caller I. D.
So, there are services
out there
that have hundreds of thousands
of honey?pot numbers
throughout the U. S., and
they can spot in real time
when the same caller I. D.
is calling throughout the U. S.
Cuban: But, you know,
the best scammers already know
what's in the database
and go out there and create,
you know, Google Voice
phone numbers.
That's correct.
That's correct.
But ?? But as soon as they
start hitting 1,000 numbers,
that reputation score
goes up as likely spam.
?But you're saying ??
?It's an ongoing battle.
I?I always think skeptics,
like Sharks ??
and you're getting
some skepticism here...
Yes, yeah.
...can be put aside
by simply telling us
why you're worth
$4 million.
$400,000 for 10% ?? you must
have a lot of sales, right?
We are pre?growth ??
We're a pre?revenue company.
Oh!
[ Laughter ]
I'm curious.
What's your backgrounds,
and how did you
come up with this?
I work on telephone systems.
I'm a telephone engineer.
I fell in love with phones
in my 20s.
I'm just
a telephone geek.
So you're old?school
old school.
Old school, definitely.
I'm also in
telecommunications,
about 30 years
in the business.
So, I had a telemarketer call
and swear at my son.
My son was
14 years old.
My son's upset, I'm mad,
and that's when I started
working on a robot
that would get their
most expensive asset on the line
and then just keep them talking
as long as possible.
See, I think
it's your civic duty
to waste the time
of a telemarketer.
You work your full?time job,
and this is like
a moonlighting thing?
We work 40 hours a week
for our employers,
and then we work
60 hours a week on this.
O'Leary: What do you make a year
off a customer?
What does it cost you
to acquire them?
What does it cost you
to service them?
So, customers will ??
The subscription
is $12 per year.
Yes.
It costs us
about $4 per year.
Cuban: Why so much? Why does it
cost you $4 per year?
O'Leary: What does it cost you
to acquire the customer?
We're learning.
We have spent nothing on
customer acquisition so far.
Okay, so back to my question.
Why does it cost you $4?
'Cause that's high.
It is high.
We have hosting fees,
telecommunications fees,
gateway fees.
But how long
do they keep it for?
Because you don't know
that yet.
You don't know what
the attrition's gonna be.
We are very early on.
However, we've spent
two years in R&amp;D.
And over that time, we realized
that we had to have a full ??
a website that gave them
full control of everything.
We're rolling
that out now.
And when I go on
this website,
will I be able
to tell
how many have
tried to call me,
or is just ??
?Yeah, no, everything.
?That's right.
?You get the recordings.
Oh, you get the recordings,
as well?
That's the best part!
That's the most
satisfying part.
It's so funny.
[ Laughs ] That's great.
Look, guys, this is a feature
rather than a product, right?
This is not
my type of business.
I'm out.
Okay.
Greiner: You know,
I really like the idea,
and I love
the revenge of it,
but I don't think
I get the concept fully yet,
so I'm out.
