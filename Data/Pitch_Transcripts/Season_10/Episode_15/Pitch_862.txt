I'm Tanya Van Court,
and I'm from
Brooklyn, New York.
I'm the CEO and founder
of Goalsetter,
and I'm here today
seeking $200,000
in exchange for a 4%
equity stake in my company.
Wow.
Anyone with kids
can tell you
our children
get too much stuff.
From birthdays to holidays,
your houses are taken over
by toys and gifts
that your kids play with
just once,
if you're lucky.
[ Chuckles ]
Van Court:
By the time they're 12,
the average American child
has received almost
$7,000 worth of junk.
Gift?giving for kids
needs a redesign,
and that's exactly
what Goalsetter is all about.
Rather than give kids more stuff
they don't need,
we provide a platform
that lets family members
and friends
give kids money to save
for goals that
they really care about.
With Goalsetter, there's no more
giving gift cards that say,
"I can't wait to see
what you <i>buy</i> next."
Instead,
family members and friends
can give GoalCards
and say,
"I can't wait to see
what you <i>do</i> next."
The money is deposited
into an FDIC?insured
savings account
accessible through our site,
where kids can watch
their savings grow ??
real money
towards real dreams.
Robotics camp, music lessons,
gymnastics, college ??
it doesn't matter
what kids save for
because kids who have
savings accounts in their name
are six times more likely
to go to college
and four times more likely
to own stocks
by the time
they're young adults,
no matter how much
is in those accounts.
So, Sharks, if you want to truly
transform kids' futures,
join me in getting them
signed up
to save with Goalsetter.
So, Tanya, instead of
giving a toy to a child
when they open the gift ??
their eyes light up
when they've got
a new basketball,
football, game, toy ??
they get a certificate
with, like,
a $30 "go deposit this
into your account"?
Like, that ??
that's just...
That's like a dream gift
for your kids.
?That's pretty depressing.
?[ Laughs ]
Well, it's actually
not depressing, Kevin,
because, you know,
you have kids.
You've seen how much stuff
kids already have.
Cuban: Okay, so, wait,
wait, wait.
Tanya, the bigger question
I have ??
trying to create bank accounts
for kids is a disaster,
so tell us how you get
FDIC accounts set up
and how ?? how it all works,
And then, of course,
we still need to hear
about your business.
So, you're right. Setting up
a savings account for kids
is absolutely
a nightmare,
which is why this is
such a great opportunity.
We set up
an FDIC?insured account
for the parent ??
in the parent's name ??
and then the parent
can easily add their kids.
We've just recently been
accepted into an accelerator
with one of the three major
consumer banks in the country.
But then don't fees
become a significant issue?
No, fees aren't
a significant issue
because our ACH
transaction fees
are only 5 cents
every time we make a transfer,
So, gift?giving is only one part
of our business, right?
But a second way kids get money
is by parents who say,
"I want to help you
save for this goal."
So, we have
the ability for parents
to set up auto?save
so they can save a little bit
every week or every month
to help kids
with big goals over time.
Those could be ??
?It's like a piggy bank.
That's right, but it could be
college, or it could be,
"My kid wants to go to this
really awesome robotics camp,
but it's really expensive."
O'Leary:
How do you make money?
So, on the gift?giving site,
we charge a dollar
for every GoalCard given,
minus the transaction fees,
which, as we talked about,
are 5 cents,
and the ACH
transaction fees.
The second way
that we make money
is with parents signing up
for any of
our savings features.
What do you
charge for that?
So, we have
historically charged
a dollar per month
per kid for that.
The third way is by taking
a percentage of assets
under management.
What's that part?
?[ Laughs ]
?Kevin!
?Easy, easy.
?That's what I ??
?I'm speaking your language.
?No, no.
That's what
I know how to do.
Okay, so,
our partner bank,
which holds our assets,
will give us a percentage back
of those assets
under management.
How many basis points
are they gonna give you?
?100 basis points.
?What?
?Yeah.
?Are you serious?
Yeah.
That's a lot of money.
That's a ton.
?Right, 1%.
?Now you've excited him.
?Whoo?hoo!
I've never seen Kevin
breathe so hard.
Kevin's
hyperventilating here.
That is more than the entire
industry of services
in mutual funds,
in exchange?traded funds,
in management fees
for people,
at brokerage houses,
online.
That's the highest fee
right now going.
How long
has this been ??
that you've been public
with this for, or selling?
Van Court:
So, we've been selling since
about January of this year,
and we have about $40,000
under management right now.
How much money have you raised
to get to this point?
We've raised
$2.1 million.
I think it's very cool.
I have a similar thing.
It's basically charitable,
but I help kids invest
a fractional share ownership
in a product
called Beanstox.
You download the app,
and you buy 15 cents of Apple.
You actually own it.
Yep. Absolutely.
But the biggest problem
is customer acquisition.
So, our cost per acquisition
is about $10 per customer
right now,
But the interesting thing is
because of the Equifax
data breach over the past year
and all the security issues
that people have,
people are concerned about
connecting their bank accounts.
And so they need us
to be a known quantity
that they can feel good about
in order to do that.
Won't the new bank
help you with that
because of their brand?
?Exactly. Kevin, I love you!
?Everybody loves me.
?[ Laughs ]
Tanya, I like your mission.
I like what you're doing.
I think it makes sense
in a lot of ways.
I think you're on your way
to getting there,
but I don't think
you're there yet,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
No!
So, Tanya,
I love what you're doing.
The problem is,
it's so outside of what I do,
in terms of physical product.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Jamie, are you sure?
Maybe Amazon can sign up
to give all of its employees...
Right?
You know, Tanya,
if you just said,
"Look, it's hard to open up
a bank account for your kids."
"Do it here." Yeah.
'Cause then you'd have
no overhead.
That's
an easy business.
You've complicated this
to no end.
I actually
don't think, Mark,
that this is
complicated to no end.
I think it's actually
super simple,
and what we've heard
from parents ??
Wait, wait, look.
I appreciate what you're trying
to accomplish, but I'm out.
Mark, you got
to come back in.
Let me finish telling you!
?Tanya, stop, stop, stop.
O'Leary:
Look, I work with all these
banks you're talking about,
and one thing
I'll tell you ??
it takes a long time
to go through
the process of approval
with your platform.
I'll make you an offer,
but it's gonna be aggressive,
because I actually
know what the work's like,
and I can bring
a lot of value by just
putting my name on it,
frankly.
I'll give you the 200 grand.
I want 25%.
?Ruh?roh.
?Ooh.
Narrator: Four Sharks are out.
Kevin is Tanya's
last chance for a deal
for her savings account
for kids, Goalsetter.
I'll give you the 200 grand.
I want 25%.
?Ruh?roh.
?Ooh.
I only give the offer
'cause I believe in the mission,
but you don't know yet
what you don't know.
I'm way past
where you are right now.
You've got
a lot of enthusiasm,
but when you get into
the nitty?gritty
of those banks
that you want to work with,
there's a whole
compliance department
the size of an army.
Kevin, we are in the top two
fintech accelerator programs
in the country.
?No, no.
There's a thousand
fintech deals.
I get called
by them every day.
We have the vice chairman of
Morgan Stanley who's an advisor.
Come on, Kevin.
It's a reset.
You got to go back
to your investor and say,
"I got Kevin O'Leary.
He's gonna drive this thing."
I know the value
I bring to this.
It just takes you
to a new level.
I'm in this space
every day.
but I just ?? I've already
seen this movie, Tanya.
You know, I'm talking
myself out of it,
the more I think
about the work.
No, don't!
We're three months away
from interfacing compliance
with a large platform.
No, you're not.
No, you're not.
We're gonna do a deal,
Kevin.
We just got to find
the right deal.
And, Tanya, remember,
he's never been wrong...before.
Yeah, that's true.
O'Leary: I?I'm just
too valuable for this.
Let's ?? I have
to work on it.
Tanya,
you can take my seat
when you make it.
Just show him.
All right, Kevin.
Well said, Tanya.
Thank you, Tanya.
Thank you.
?Good luck, Tanya.
?Thank you.
?And thank you for that.
?I appreciate you.
?Good luck.
?Thank you very much.
Okay. Bye?bye.
?The love affair's over.
?I love her, though.
?She's great.
?I wish I knew the space better.
I just ?? I couldn't
help that space.
[ Groans ]
It is a nightmare.
Hearing Jamie say,
"Hey, prove Kevin wrong,
and you can come up here
and have my seat,"
I'm gonna take Jamie up
on that offer.
I'm gonna be occupying his seat
in four more years.
You just wait.
