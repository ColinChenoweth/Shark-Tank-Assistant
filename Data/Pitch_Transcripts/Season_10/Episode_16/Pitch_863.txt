Beaudry: Welcome to the world
of floating.
...and chasing their dreams.
This entire product
has been my life.
I put this together on my own.
And tonight, co?founder
of RSE Ventures
and vice chairman of the
Miami Dolphins Matt Higgins
returns to the Tank.
You've been trapped
in this prison
of an inflated valuation.
But our valuation is fair.
You're ruining people.
Throw me a bone, Daddy.
[ Dog whines ]
My name's Scott Swerland.
And I'm Joe Beaudry.
We're from
Seattle, Washington,
and we're seeking $500,000
for 5% of our company,
Urban Floats.
?Ooh.
?God.
Sharks, this is
your escape pod.
It will take you away
from the stresses
and anxieties of life,
giving you better focus,
faster recovery,
and reduced pain.
All you need to do
is get in this pod,
and your life will improve.
Welcome to the world
of floating.
Floating is a form of peaceful,
weightless hydrotherapy
where you step into this
sensory?controlled environment
and feel the calming effects
on the mind and body.
It's a trend that's exploding,
and we're leading the charge.
Sharks, you simply show up
to one of our high?end
Urban Float spas,
where you will check into
your own private
relaxation sanctuary,
where you will float
weightlessly
in 200 gallons of water,
made buoyant by 1,200 pounds
of Epsom salt.
You'll leave all the stresses
and noise of your life behind,
and when you leave this pod,
you will return to life
renewed, refreshed,
and revived.
Better focus!
Faster recovery!
Less physical pain!
Floating makes everything
you do in life better.
Sharks, we're seeing
incredible success,
and we would love
your help
to share the benefits
of floating
with everyone
around the world.
How many of you Sharks
want to swim ??
I should say "float" ??
with this proven team?
Greiner:
So, many years ago,
they came out
with float tanks, right?
Creepier looking, for sure.
?Yes, yes.
This is much better?looking.
So, I think
the biggest difference
between
the old days and today ??
this is something
that people look at
and they want to get in.
They want
to experience this.
?Yeah.
?There is music options.
There is lighting options.
You can really
take this experience
as far as
you want to go with it.
And on top of that,
we build our centers to be
very kind of high?end,
more spa?like.
Does each person get
a new salt bag
or is it the same salt bag
the last guy rotated in?
So, what we do is,
the entire body of water
goes through a filtration system
no less than four times
where it's heated,
treated, hit with UV,
it's sanitized,
and then back in.
The water's actually cleaner
than your drinking faucet.
That is the highest priority.
Higgins: First of all,
I love the space.
The Dolphins ??
we're doing a ton of work
around recovery
and how to get athletes
back on their feet
as soon as possible,
and float tanks
and meditation
is a big part of it.
I want to hear about
the business a bit.
I'm missing ??
Okay, great.
Urban Float has
four corporate stores.
We've spent
the last five years
kind of perfecting the box.
So, we opened up
the largest float center
in the United States
in downtown Seattle,
and ?? and about two years ago,
we got into franchising.
Someone came and banged
on our door and said,
"Hey, we really want
to do this."
She actually
came back last month
and bought four more, uh,
with the profits
from her first store.
Nice.
We have audited statements
for our franchising.
We've ?? We've registered
in every state.
How did you guys fund
all this?
Where did the money
come from?
So, we opened up our first store
real bootstrap,
and, uh, we did that
with friends and family.
And how much
did you raise?
$300,000,
and we've taken another
$1 million of our profits
and opened up
the additional stores.
Does it cost 300k
to open a location,
the average location?
It costs ??
It costs about $500,000
to $600,000.
Wow.
How many beds in a $500,000
to $600,000 ??
Including the equipment,
which ??
So how many beds
in a $500,000 ??
?Six.
?Six.
Prototypical store is six.
?Six beds.
?Six beds.
Yep.
For half a mill,
you get six beds
plus the front office.
?Yes, sir.
?Yeah.
This is bought from a company
that makes them,
so anybody could buy them?
?Yes.
?You didn't design it?
We did not design this, no.
Higgins:
Tell us about the customer.
What's the model?
Are you doing a membership?
Are you doing, you know,
one?time?
Yeah, so, we do have
a range of offerings
to get people
to float regularly.
We have a single float session
for $45
to come and try it out.
?That's not bad.
?Yeah.
Oh, the first time.
The first time, right?
Yeah.
And then we ask people,
you know, really, you've
got to give this three tries.
Like, you can't
just go to a gym
and get ripped
on one workout, right?
You have to invest
a little bit of time.
Tell us what
the membership fees are.
The membership fees are ??
unlimited is $150.
?A month.
?For the month.
?Okay.
?Yeah.
O'Leary: This year, what is
the model gonna make,
including the corporate?owned
stores and the franchise fees
and the royalties
and everything?
We'll do $2.5 million.
We're on run?rate
to do $2.5 million.
Pre?tax, bot??
to the bottom line.
No. Top ??
Top?end revenue.
I just ?? I care about
cash flow, here.
About $600,000
in cash flow.
Okay.
And you put a price on this,
$500,000 for 5%.
$10 million.
$10 million.
Yep.
We are registered ??
You know, it's not crazy.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Coming from you,
that means a lot.
?Oh, he rarely says that.
?Yeah, I know.
That does mean a lot.
So, how much debt does
this company have on it?
We've got
just about $1 million
of SBA financing
and bank debt.
Cuban: Guys, look.
Every five years,
there's something new
that athletes try first,
and then
it becomes popular.
I mean, the Mavs,
10 years ago,
started using cryotherapy.
Joe and Scott
have an offer from Kevin
for their floatation
spa company, Urban Float,
but Matt may also
be interested.
Beaudry: We can do...
This deal is floating away.
I mean, I'm willing to ??
Think how much more money
you will be making.
So much more.
The middle between
5% and 15% is 10%.
Can we do 10%?
I'll ?? I'll ??
Can we please do 10%?
And we will perform for you
like no one's business.
People love this.
?This guy can sell.
?I love it.
?I'm ready.
?"People love it."
All right, here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Let's just put ?? let's just
put it out, all right?
We're gonna be
co?founders together.
We're gonna make a company
that's gonna be
well over $100 million
in a couple years.
If you do 12.5%,
we have a deal right now.
Swerland: You know,
at the end of the day,
a couple extra points
to get Matt in there,
and the horsepower he brings,
you know, that's okay.
John: I love when people
ignore you, Kev.
I mean, they didn't even
think about you.
Greiner: Oh, my God.
That was so perfect for you.
I was ready to jump up and go,
"What are you doing?"
Good job, Matt.
Thank you.
