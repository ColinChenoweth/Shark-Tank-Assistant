Hi, Sharks.
I'm Amanda.
And I'm Hamza.
And these are
our three little ones.
We're the family
from Shelton, Connecticut
behind Kudo Banz.
We're seeking $150,000
for a 10% equity stake
in our company.
Sharks, every day
around the world,
parents struggle with
the same parenting challenges
like potty training, tantrums,
and bedtime routines.
To help, parents have used
the sticker?chart method
for decades.
It's a great go?to
parenting tool that works.
It helps track
the kids' progress
and really motivates them
to listen.
The problem with
sticker charts is
they're always
stuck at home.
Let's go to the park.
That's why we've
invented Kudo Banz,
a better sticker chart
for your child's wrist.
Now, here's how Kudo Banz ??
Wait, wait, wait,
Mom and Dad.
We got this.
It's time the kids
explained it.
Are you sure?
Yeah, come on.
We've grown up
on this show.
Amanda: All right, guys,
you're right. You've got this.
But where are you going?
Where are they going?
?Okay.
?[ Laughs ]
I hate to make children cry.
Hopefully they don't
make you cry.
I'm ready.
?Oh.
?[ Laughs ]
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Mika'il.
I'm Ayaan.
And this is Sofia.
Hi.
Hi.
So, here's how
Kudo Banz works.
Kudo Banz starts
with a storybook,
where kids learn
that listening is fun.
At the end of the story,
they get a cool band to wear
and earn Kudos
for good listening.
Now, Sofia already
made her bed this morning
and ate lunch
without whining...
[ Laughs ]
...so she's already earned
herself two Kudos.
The third Kudo you earn
is a magical Kudo.
Hey, Mom and Dad, let's give
Sofia her third Kudo.
Sure.
It comes to life
with the Kudo Banz app,
and it's super cool.
Look.
?Wow!
?So cool!
That is cool.
And it unlocks
a customizable wheel
where kids get rewarded
for good behavior.
And kids pick
their own rewards,
like reading an extra book
at bedtime.
Or our favorite...
Together:
Family dance party.
Hamza: So, Sharks, who wants
to join our worldwide mission
to make parenting easier?
We have samples
for each of you ??
our starter kit plus a special
Shark Kudo just for you.
Mika'il: For Matt,
we chose the lemon shark
for its curious
and resilient nature.
And for Lori, we chose
the Port Jackson shark
because they're unique,
fearless risk takers.
?Thank you.
?You're welcome.
And for Kevin, we chose
the great white shark
because you're powerful
and widely feared.
Absolutely.
For Daymond,
we chose the tiger shark
for its fashionable stripes
and go?for?the?power?
of?broke mentality...
Tiger shark.
...when it comes
to its dinner.
And finally, for you, Mark,
we chose the bull shark...
Yeah.
...for its ability to adapt
and be successful in anything...
That's what
I'm talking about.
...salt or freshwater.
Greiner:
I got it on. [ Laughs ]
I'm not sure
I'm gonna get it off, but ??
There you go.
[ Laughter ]
How old are you guys?
I'm 11.
I'm 9.
And I'm 6.
Greiner: So, in my bag,
I've got three bands,
and then I have
a bunch of ??
There's a total
of six different charms.
?Yep.
?Mm?hmm.
So, are there specific charms
for specific chores?
Actually not.
So, there's
a whole different collection
of charms you can get,
so parents will give
the charms to the kids,
and they'll select,
as they've done good listening,
each charm.
The third charm always
is that magical charm
that Mom and Dad puts on
the kids' bracelet
that comes to life.
Do those change?
Do you keep changing that,
or do they stay
the same rewards?
Mika'il:
It's customizable,
so you can add on
different rewards
based on different goals
you have.
Higgins: So, tell us a little
bit about, you know,
what inspired you
to create the product.
Hamza: Definitely.
I came home
one day from work,
and Amanda said,
"I had a moment with Mika'il.
He came home and told me that
I'm not a good listener."
And she was like, you know,
"I think it's our parenting.
You know, all these
time?outs and negative ??
he's drawing attention
to that negative focus."
And then she said,
"You know what?
I'm gonna make a product
that's gonna help
other moms and dads
across America
and the world."
We did a soft launch
mid?year in 2017
to really learn our market
and the new category
we were creating.
Our big debut was at
the 2018 New York Toy Fair,
where we met
a lot of retailers.
So far,
our sales are $80,000.
Mika'il,
where do you go to college?
[ Laughter ]
$80,000 in sales
is not a business yet.
So let's talk about the strategy
for distribution.
We actually are selling it
all across the U. S.
But you're doing it
online, right?
Amanda: Online.
We're doing it online
on our website.
We're on Amazon.
What do you sell it
to them for?
What does it cost you
to make it?
Yeah, the starter kit
comes at $29.95,
which includes
the hardcover storybook.
Right.
We're talking
to buybuy Baby.
We met them at
the New York Toy Fair.
So yeah, we've got a great plan,
and it's not a hobby.
We're all?in
on this business.
Amanda: Absolutely.
I actually resigned
from my hedge?fund job
about two years ago
to jump into
entrepreneurship.
Greiner: Wow.
Amanda grew a firm ??
she's a successful
entrepreneur ??
with a 20?cent investment
and took it all the way
to a million?dollar ??
Another company.
?20?cent investment.
?20?cent investment.
To a million dollars?
Amanda: 20 cents
to multi?million dollars.
And we have one of the most
successful companies on Etsy.
We are the top ?? Go ahead.
You can tell her.
I know it's your favorite.
We're in the top 1%
of the 1% of the 30%
in the entire Etsy.
Wow.
I think you've achieved the
most important thing in life,
which is raised
a wonderful family.
I understand rewards
and token systems.
I know how many
there are out there,
and I'm just
not comfortable
that it's
differentiated enough
to be a big business,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Appreciate your time.
We understand. Thanks.
I'm currently
working on a book
that I feel might be
a conflict of interest.
We're sorry to hear that.
For now, though, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
I understand.
John: I had a company
that I invested in
in Season 2 called Flipoutz,
and the company
was creating bands ??
not for the same thing ??
but it's very hard
to have longevity
in the kids wanting
to wear the bands.
It kind of wears out
after a while.
So, with that, I'm out.
?Okay.
?Thank you, Daymond.
The fact that you have
all these awards is tempting,
but you're not worth
$1.5 million.
Nobody beat you up
about valuation,
and, kids,
this is important.
I'm gonna take
a Kudos from you.
?Yeah, that's all right.
?No taking Kudos away.
$150,000 for 10% is
a $1.5 million valuation.
That's a lot of money
for something
that isn't making
any money yet, but ??
Our margins are huge,
though.
[ Laughter ]
We make the starter kit
and potty kit for $4.98,
and we sell it for $29.95.
O'Leary:
Here's your problem.
With $80,000 in sales,
you want a valuation
of $1.5 million.
There's no investor
gonna do that
until there's more
proof of concept.
And you're gonna
have to give up
some inordinate percentage
of your company
to just get the $150,000.
But our valuation is fair.
?No, it isn't.
?It is fair.
Higgins: [ Laughs ]
I love this kid.
It is fair.
He's got you speechless.
?I understand.
?He's stumped.
You ?? he can't finish.
?You don't know our assets yet.
?It's very hard for me to ??
Our assets are very good.
We have IP patents,
many patents.
Keep going.
I love this kid.
Love him!
I love it.
You want to take my chair?
I could give you some reasons
why it's not fair.
Kevin, all he's missing
is a big snout.
Let's not go there, okay?
He's a little you.
Look, I just think
it's too early.
I can't go down the path
with you.
I'm out.
Amanda: We're gonna
take this negative
and turn it into
a giant positive.
In a way, it's a gift
that they gave us,
because now we're out there
to prove ourselves,
and better believe it
that this team right here
is gonna do that.
Good job.
I'm so proud of you guys.
So proud of you guys.
You know, I'm so proud of
these kids right here.
I'm so proud of you.
Yeah, we took on the Tank,
and, you know, they're gonna ??
they're gonna regret this.
They're definitely gonna
regret this.
