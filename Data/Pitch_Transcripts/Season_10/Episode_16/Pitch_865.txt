Jason Kidd, Dirk used cryo,
until they didn't.
They like it.
"Oh, it's great.
It's great.
It's great."
"When was the last time
you used it?"
"Oh, I keep on
forgetting to go."
There's just so many ifs,
it just creates
too many concerns.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mark.
John: You know,
$1 million in debt
is obviously ??
it's a lot of money.
I don't believe
in your retail strategy.
I don't think there's anything
proprietary here.
I'm out.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jason Hernandez.
I'm from San Diego, California.
I'm here seeking $100,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company, Pooch Selfie.
Sharks, I'm a dog lover.
I'm absolutely crazy about
my fur kid, here, Logan.
And like any dog lover,
I take a million pictures
of this little guy.
What I found is, for every
great picture I got with Logan,
it would take me
about 10 bad shots
before I got the right one.
You see, the problem was,
it was proving impossible
to get Logan to sit long enough
and look into my smartphone
for a great picture.
Now, I can't even tell you
how many times
I've had my face licked while
trying to get a great selfie.
?Ah.
?Ew.
So I searched and searched
for the answer to this problem,
and I found I wasn't
the only one struggling
to get great pictures
with their dogs.
Seemed like nobody had
figured this thing out,
and I knew there just had
to be a better way.
That's why I invented
Pooch Selfie.
Pooch Selfie is
a ridiculously simple device
which uses your dog's natural
draw and focus to a tennis ball,
and uses this power to hold
your dog's attention long enough
for you to capture
the best photos of your dog.
To use Pooch Selfie,
my wife, Erica, will actually
help us demonstrate.
Just take our universal
smartphone clip
and attach it to
the top of your device.
Next, grab one of our Pooch
Selfie squeaky tennis balls
and place it in
the clasping mechanism.
?Wow.
?And voílà!
You have instantly become
a master dog photographer.
That's great.
Pooch Selfie has been
an instant hit with dog lovers.
Take a look at some
of our happy customers.
Not only can you use
Pooch Selfie
to get fantastic selfies
with your dogs,
but you can also use it
to get some
pretty awesome portraits
of them as well.
?Aww.
?[ Chuckles ]
Now, I need your help
to get Pooch Selfie
in the hands of dog lovers
everywhere.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to help me change the way
we take pictures and selfies
with our fur kids
and show the world that you can
teach an old dog new tricks?
[ Chuckles ]
Do we get samples?
Yes, we have samples here
for you.
And then my wife, Erica,
is actually gonna take Logan
out to play some ball.
Cuban: See ya, Logan.
Bye, Logan.
Bye, buddy.
Erica: Good boy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Kevin, here you go.
Daymond.
Thank you.
Mark.
Thanks.
Appreciate it, bud.
Thank you very much.
Okay, Jason,
how many Pooch Selfies
have you sold already?
I've sold about 15,800.
?Dollars?
?Good for you.
No, units.
Cuban: And what does
each of them sell for?
How many have you sold?
I?I?I'm sorry.
$380,000 worth of sales.
?$380,000.
?$380,000.
?Sales.
?That's respectable.
Each one sells
for $9.99 today.
And what's it cost you?
$1.30.
Is that landed with packaging
and everything?
That's land?? That's sitting
in a warehouse, $1.30.
Good for you.
$380,000 in sales.
For the entire lifetime
of sales.
How many units was that?
Do you know how many units
you've sold?
Off the top of my head ??
I have a little bit of
deer in headlights,
so I don't know...
Take a breath.
But do you know?
I mean, if you weren't
nervous right now,
do you have a good handle
on the numbers?
Yes, correct, I would.
So, take a breath
and tell us,
you know, give us
the whole picture.
[ Breathes deeply ]
25,000 units, approximately.
Are you doing this alone?
I am. I am.
So you're running
the business?
Every aspect ??
everything that you see here
is completely done by me.
But somebody can knock this off
in two seconds, right?
Yes, but I am
U. S. patent approved,
so I have a patent here
in the U. S.
Utility?
A utility patent.
How have you sold them?
Online?
74% of our sales have done
completely at retail
by myself online ??
online retail.
So, have you approached
any retailers
that sell dog stuff?
We do.
So, uh, we actually got them
into my dream retailer,
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
This is something
that just happened.
They rolled them out into
tons of different stores,
but what happened is
they put it on a shelf
amongst all
the other dog toys,
and this really needs a lot
of customer education
for people to understand
exactly what it is,
make the impulse decision of,
"Oh, my God, that's really cool.
I need to get that."
So it got delisted
in Bed, Bath.
No, they did a markdown.
Tell us about your background.
Where did you ??
Have you always been
an entrepreneur?
So, I went to school ??
I'm a mechanical engineer.
I designed it, it got fine?tuned
for manufacturability,
and then I actually took it
to China myself,
found the molder...
Good for you.
...and, you know, worked with
them to get the actual part.
?Wow.
?How much have you invested?
$18,000.
Cuban: Your own money?
My own money, correct.
?Any loans?
?No loans.
?Any debt?
?No debt.
Do you work on this
100% yourself at all times?
No, unfortunately,
Pooch Selfie is the dream job
I wish I could have.
It's not enough
to support myself
let alone my family.
So what are you doing?
I'm an electronics salesman.
I do that during the day.
We have a one?year?old
that is taking up my afternoons.
Congratulations.
And then this is what cuts
into the sleep.
So, what are you gonna do
with the 100k?
Actually, I would like
to redesign Pooch Selfie.
The product was made for two
of the most popular cellphones
out there today.
But there has been some pushback
on its compatibility
with, uh, other cellphones
that are out there.
So the next would be
redo the packaging,
because I feel that the
packaging that I put together
has limited
the shelf appeal.
And the rest?
Towards our follow?up item,
which is the same concept,
but it actually holds a treat
instead of a tennis ball.
And why wouldn't you
do that right now?
Do you have
any inventory?
I have inventory of
the original Pooch Selfie.
How much?
18,000 units.
18,000 units?
Correct.
Well, that's
$180,000 worth.
That's your money
right there.
Yeah. No wonder
you don't have any cash
or are making
any money off of this.
Why would you not
just take your time?
You already have a day job
that helps feed your family.
Eat through
the inventory you have
and then retain 100%
of your company
instead of having
an investor here
that you have to report to
or consider?
Mm?hmm.
Why would you do that?
[ Clears throat ]
This has been a lot of my life,
and it's, uh...
It's been really...
It's been really hard
to watch people
try to capitalize on the idea
and steal it.
I'm not only trying
to grow this business,
but I'm also, um ??
I'm also trying to protect it,
and that's the stuff
that nobody sees.
[ Voice breaking ]
Nobody sees...
When you've created something
that nobody's ever seen before,
you watch so many people
just try to take it from you.
I made this because
I love my dog.
My dog's not gonna
be around forever.
That was my first
best friend.
And I just want
to share that with people
so that they can do
the same thing.
This entire product
has been my life.
I put this together
on my own,
no help from anybody,
and I've had people tell me
it's a fantastic idea,
and I've had people tell me
it was a horrible idea.
But I made this.
I want Pooch Selfie to be
the number?one brand name
for what people think about
when they want to take pictures
with their dogs.
Listen.
I, um...
My dog Spartan just died.
Aww, I'm sorry.
And, uh...
And I don't have any pictures
of him looking like that.
I could never
get him to look.
So I understand, you know,
the passion
to have something,
and also, you know, the love
of our little furry friends.
$100,000, 33 1/3%, right now,
I'll do the deal.
I'll take that risk with you.
Daymond, would you mind
if I hear any other offers?
I wouldn't do that.
Jason, I'm out.
I'm out.
I'm out.
I'm out.
Daymond, I'd love
to partner with you.
?All right, smart man.
?There you go.
Whoo. I was about
to take it back.
I was, 'cause I wanted you
to be decisive.
All right?
All right, congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations, Jason.
Great job.
