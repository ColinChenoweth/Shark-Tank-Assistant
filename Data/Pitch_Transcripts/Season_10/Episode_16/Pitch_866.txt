Bethencourt: I was fascinated
by the idea of creating
an entirely new type
of pet food.
Narrator:
...by thinking big...
Hi. My name
is Ryan Bethencourt.
I'm a biotech entrepreneur
and CEO.
I'm seeking $550,000
for 5% of my company...
Oh!
...Wild Earth.
Wow.
Sharks, as an animal lover,
I'm concerned about
how we feed our pets.
What's really in their food ??
with so many ingredients
we can't even pronounce,
and major pet?food recalls
happening frequently.
In addition, pet obesity
is a serious problem,
with fillers and fats being
added to conventional pet food,
and there's another problem.
It's really bad
for the environment,
polluting our water,
soil, and air.
As a biotech entrepreneur
with a track record
in cellular agriculture,
I was fascinated
by the idea of creating
an entirely new type
of pet food.
Introducing Wild Earth,
a cultured, protein dog food
made with human?grade koji.
Koji is the secret sauce
in miso, soy sauce, and sake.
It's added to boost
the umami flavor
craved by billions worldwide.
Koji is rich in protein
and contains
the 10 essential amino acids
that dogs require
in their food.
And they love it,
so I'll show you.
So, we've got
Freddy and Josie.
So, hey, guys.
When's the last time Freddy
and Josie ate anything?
?About a week ago.
?This morning.
[ Laughs ] So ??
and, they are fans.
Proof's in the pudding.
So, Sharks,
it's time to get serious
with how we feed our pets
more safely,
sustainably, and ethically.
I invite you to join
the koji revolution.
?They want more.
?They do want more.
?I mean, they're looking.
?Yeah, we'll give them more.
I think they'll nibble some
as well.
Essentially, you're forcing
dogs into veganship
whether they want it or not.
Bethencourt:
One for everyone.
Are we gonna regret this?
?No, no. Definitely not.
?Okay, all right.
Wait, you're saying we can
actually taste it?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you. Mark.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.
Bethencourt: All right.
So, this is made for dogs,
but it's made in our facility.
This was made in
a human?grade kitchen.
It's a flavor dogs love.
Yeah, I'm not happy
or unhappy.
It tastes like oatmeal.
Well, it's koji,
bacon flavor ??
non?animal?based ??
and peanut butter.
Dogs love it.
It's got over 10% koji.
So, we actually make koji
ourselves.
Is 10% enough protein?
Not off of treats.
You can't feed a dog
off treats.
These are treats?
They're not dog food.
Treats, and this is
our prototype kibble.
So, our treats are being ??
we're releasing them in October,
and then our kibble,
we're shooting to release ??
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna ask the question
they're about to ask.
You just said something
really, really bad.
$550,000 for 5%.
That means that
you are saying
your company is worth
$11 million.
O'Leary:
It's a steal, Daymond.
You just said...
[ Clears throat ]
Operators are standing by.
It is a steal, Daymond,
for a multi?billion?dollar
company.
...some words called
"I just released it,"
or you're about to?
We're about to.
So, we're gonna be releasing
commercially in October.
How much sale did
you do of anything
to make this company worth
$11 million right now?
We did a lot of R&amp;D.
Oh!
Uh?oh.
You don't say.
but they're skeptical of
Ryan's $11 million valuation
for his vegan dog food company,
Wild Earth,
which has not yet
hit the market.
Daymond, would it be helpful
if I told you a story?
Please tell me a story.
Okay, so I helped start
what's now called
the biohacker movement,
right?
At the end of 2008,
these companies
were going bankrupt ??
these biotech companies ??
and we basically bought
the bankrupt equipment
and starting building
little labs in our homes ??
community labs.
That led to me co?founding
the largest biotech accelerator
in the world.
It's actually called
IndieBio.
Wait, what does that
have to do with the valuation?
Like, what does that have
to do with the valuation?
So, our ?? our last ??
I'm just ??
I'm missing something.
Yeah. Our last priced round
was actually led
by Felicis Ventures...
Sure.
...and Peter Thiel.
Yeah.
And they invested
in the potential of
the alternative protein
to totally disrupt
the $30 billion pet?food market
just in the U. S. alone.
And how much did they invest?
How much did they invest?
They invested $2 million.
That's the total
you've taken in?
No, we've taken in a total
of $4 million, so we've ??
You've taken in $4 million
for dog biscuits?
Mm?hmm.
So, what problem
are you solving, again,
by making me eat
a very dry dog snack?
Yeah, so, there is no
future food leader
in the alternative protein space
in pet food.
But where do you get
the koji from?
So, we basically have created
our own strains of koji.
I'm a biotech guy.
My co?founder is
a serial entrepreneur with me.
He is a hard?core scientist.
He did his PhD at Princeton,
did his post?doc at Harvard.
Yeah, huge pedigree.
I get all that.
You get it.
Where are you making it?
In our lab.
So, we have a lab where
we basically take sugar
as the raw feed stock,
we use our bioreactors,
and we continue to scale
our bioreactors.
We have our own strains of koji
that are highly efficient,
can be industrialized
to scale.
We use cells
and products of cells
to create
clean protein sources.
What does
this dog food cost
compared to
traditional dog food?
Right now, at our first
level of scale,
our COGS for the treats
is about $3.50,
and we'll be selling
the treats for $12.99.
?That's a lot.
?It's a premium product.
What is a typical
bag of treats?
$6 a bag.
And what about dog food,
let's say,
when you advance
into the dog food?
So, dog food,
we're at a premium scale.
So when we initially launch,
probably looking at
a $40 price point.
?$40?
?$40 for one bag?
Yep.
Wow.
So, you're looking
for alternative foods...
You got it.
...that are better
for the environment.
Better for the animals.
Better across the board,
right?
Yeah.
So question is,
when you raised the $4 million,
what was the valuation?
It was $7.5 million
pre?money,
and then it was a $9.5 million
post?money valuation.
How much equity do
you have to give up?
The founders own about
50% of the company,
a little less than 50%.
How much do you own?
About 20%.
?And that's after conversion.
?That's after conversion.
Y?You basically convinced
somebody that dog food's
worth 7 million bucks
before you sold any of it.
Kevin, Kevin.
The U. S. market is
a $30 billion market.
If we want to talk numbers,
let's talk global markets.
Yeah, but families
can't afford to buy
incredibly expensive,
premium, you know,
vegan dog food.
There will be some families
that spend less...
John:
They'll eat it themselves.
...on their children
feeding them,
So, I have a question,
'cause you've been
observing the dogs
that obviously
been eating this.
Yes.
Over time, when you
force them to be vegan,
do they change?
Do they start wearing
tie?dye and Birkenstocks,
and are they sort of
laid back?
Look, you're a very
credible guy,
but there is no friggin' way
in the world
I'm putting $11 million
on a dog food company that
hasn't sold anything yet.
And on top of that,
if you're successful,
all these dogs are gonna
start dreaming about meat,
just sitting
on the sofa going,
"Ohh, I wish
I could have some meat."
So, Kevin, let me stop you
for one second.
When you say "meat" ??
When you say "meat,"
what meat do you think
goes into conventional
dog food?
I mean,
throw me a bone, Daddy.
I'm not giving you ??
Chicken feathers and beaks.
Ain't gonna happen.
I'm out.
You have to make a decision,
Ryan ?? yes or no?
It's just a decision.
So, you know, at the
$9.5 million valuation,
that's where, you know,
my investors are at.
Don't you think
your investors realize
what Mark Cuban could do
for this company?
Of course.
Yeah, but it's not even
about me, right?
You knew when you said yes
to be on "Shark Tank"
that you were gonna
have to negotiate.
$550,000, 10% of the company,
and then we have a deal.
I'm ?? Mark,
I'm willing to do that
even if that has
to come out of me.
?Done.
?Wow.
?All right.
?Wow.
I would not
have expected that.
Thank you, Mark.
Appreciate it, buddy.
Thanks.
That's ?? yeah.
That's great.
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Yeah, I can see it.
It may ??
It may have to...
I understand.
Okay.
Appreciate it.
All right.
Thank you, guys.
?Congratulations.
?Well done.
?I think you're both high.
?Right.
You better take them dogs
to In?N?Out Burger.
They're about to faint.
Bye, vegan dogs.
All right, let's see ??
they won't do any high fives.
If I were to say, you know,
who here in the Shark Tank
I would've loved to have made
a deal with, it was Mark,
so I know my whole team
is gonna be super excited,
and I'm really glad to
hopefully work with him
to really scale Wild Earth
into a multi?billion?dollar
company
that's really gonna make
the world better for our pets.
Congratulations, "Shark Tank,"
on 10 years.
When I pitched Parker's Maple,
I was only 18 years old.
We had about
$350,000 of sales,
and today we have almost
$3 million.
We've hired dozens of employees
and moved into
a brand?new facility
off my family's farm.
Thank you, "Shark Tank,"
for giving me
and other entrepreneurs
just like me
the opportunity to truly fulfill
our American dream.
