Hey, Sharks.
I'm Bryan Lewis.
And I'm Caleb Lewis.
And together, we are...
Press Waffle Co.
Press Waffle Co.
We're a fully family?owned
business based in Dallas, Texas.
?What?!
?We specialize
in authentic
Belgian waffle creations.
We are here today
seeking $200,000
in exchange for 8% equity
in our company.
Now, Sharks, when I say waffle,
what do you think of?
One of those thin, frozen,
lifeless breakfast substitutes?
Sorry, friends, but this?
This ain't no waffle.
Now let me take you
on a journey
to a region of Belgium
untouched by the sticky
fingers of American cuisine.
We begin with a dense,
buttery, brioche?style dough
that takes 24 hours
to rise.
?Ohh.
?Oh.
After that, we sprinkle in
some beautiful
Belgian pearl sugar.
?Mmm.
?This is sugar that melts down
in the iron to form
a golden caramel crust
around a chewy,
fluffy waffle center...
?Oh, preach it, Bryan.
?...giving you the perfect bite.
Now, <i>that</i> is a waffle.
?We want some.
?Oh...my...goodness.
I'm getting all hot
just thinking about it!
Am I right, Barbara?
[ Laughter ]
Oh, yeah, Barbara.
Bryan:
And if that wasn't enough,
you can fully customize
your waffle
from our selection
of over 16 different toppings.
Or if you're feeling
really crazy,
you can go with one
of our savory selections,
like our best?selling
chicken and waffles
or our Monte Cristo
waffle sandwich.
Wow.
Sharks, we have
something special,
and we want to get
these waffles into as many hands
as possible
all across America.
So join our team
of waffle enthusiasts
and help us teach America...
Both:
...a new way to waffle.
Who's hungry?
?Waffle on, baby. Let's go.
?Oh.
?You've got our attention now.
?Bring them on, bring them on.
Good, good. Caleb's gonna
make it for you right here.
I'm gonna finish it up
for you.
So, what he's gonna be
making for you today
is called The House.
It's our
number?one?selling waffle.
What it's gonna be is
some fresh?cut strawberries,
our house?made
whipped cream...
Corcoran: Mmm.
...a little bit
of cookie butter,
a little bit of Nutella.
?I hate you guys already.
?Ah.
Greiner: Oh, my God.
[ Laughing ] Ohh.
?There you go, Robert.
?We'll give Lori one.
Yeah, there goes
my no?carb diet.
Yeah.
?Oh, my God.
?Oh!
?Sir.
?Today is a good day. Yeah.
?It is a good day. Yes, sir.
?Yes.
Oh, my God.
That's good.
?Thank you.
?These are dough?based waffles,
so they are gonna be denser.
?Oh, my God.
?They've got more texture.
?My God.
?So good.
?How many calories in The House?
So, we have not done
nutritional testing, and...
Too many.
?No!
?...you know, we don't ??
We don't ??
?Na, na, na, na, na, na!
Don't tell me! Don't tell me!
We ?? We don't want to
because the thing is,
is we are
an indulgent product.
?Mmm.
?We are not aiming ?? Like...
This is sick.
It's sick in a good way.
?Thank you so much.
?Thank you.
Herjavec: Can we find out
how much it is?
What do you charge
for it?
So, The House is $8.
Who came up with the idea?
What was the "a?ha!" moment?
Basically,
a couple years ago,
my wife and I were
traveling through Europe.
I sit down
at this little café,
and I say,
"Can I get a waffle?"
And I took a bite into it,
and I was like,
"Ho?ly crap."
[ Imitates explosion ]
I was like, "I've never had
anything like this before."
When we came back, I couldn't
find these waffles anywhere,
so just as a hobby, I started
making them on my own.
How much do you make
per square foot,
or what is the total size
of the store?
We're over
$5,000 per square foot.
Very good, gentlemen.
?We're, uh ??
?Wow.
?Uh?huh.
?How many locations?
How many loc?? one location?
Greiner: And are you in a mall,
or are you a stand?still?
So, it's the first
European?style food hall
in North Texas.
A food hall is basically like
your upscale food court.
So what you're talking about
is local chefs,
artisan creators,
and food vendors.
It's a destination.
It's not ?? Yeah.
It's a destination.
What's the revenue on that
location gonna be this year?
$900,000.
We have really good margins.
We're operating at about
a 14% profit margin.
So ?? But where else
is next, then?
There's not a lot of those
types of destinations.
?There are.
?So, there are.
?It is all ?? It's a huge trend.
?The food hall segment, guys,
is exploding!
Corcoran: It's growing
like gangbusters.
It's crazy.
O'Leary: The model is,
they're getting a royalty
off your sales, right?
Cuban: 8%?
25.5%
right where we are now.
?Whoa!
?What?!
?Yeah, wait. Repeat that.
?Whoa!
?And we still have 14% ??
?Repeat that.
?Hang on, hang on, hang on.
?Right now ??
?Repeat that.
?Right now, we are paying 25.5%
off of
our top?line revenues,
and we are
still generating a 14% profit.
?Off gross revenue?
?Okay, so, what other ??
?And that is our rent.
?Gross.
But what are
the circumstances ??
Caleb: That's our rent
and utilities.
And if I understand it
correctly ??
Let's say you sell nothing
for the month.
Would your rent be zero?
Yes.
But how do you know that you'll
be able to take this concept
and get in at the same rent
in all these other locations?
So, first of all,
we already have
seven other food halls
in place,
signed L. O. I. s or leases.
?All in Texas?
?As franchises or yours?
As company?owned stores.
25.5%
is what we're paying now.
We're not gonna pay
more than 20% anywhere,
and most of them are 15%.
What ?? Bryan,
what does it cost you
to build out
a new location?
About $115,000 to $150,000.
?That's very, very cheap.
?That's it?
The other locations,
do you have a similar deal,
that if you don't sell
for a month...
Yes.
Yeah.
...the rent is zero?
Yes, sir.
There are ?? There are ??
That's why you can open up
so many locations.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Okay, guys,
I like what you're doing.
Right?
But 8% isn't enough.
I can help you.
Obviously in Dallas,
I can ?? I can help a lot.
Yes, sir.
And ?? And ?? And help
with the financing, as well.
?Okay.
?So, what I'll offer you
is $350,000
for 20% of the company.
That is an awesome offer,
and we really appreciate it.
That is ?? That is
an incredible offer.
Seriously.
Out ?? Out of re??
I?I ?? We would love to be able
to hear the other Sharks out.
Corcoran:
I'd like to give you an offer.
As I'm listening to your
numbers, they're identical,
every inch of it,
to Cousins Maine Lobster, okay?
They have 35 locations,
and sales right now
are $45 million.
That's a little bit better
than $1 million a store.
They have learned
'cause they grew very quickly,
but they did it so smartly,
just like you.
They're rock solid,
and they could have hired
and/or opened
maybe 500% more trucks,
but they're smart enough to know
it's all in the partnership.
So, I'm gonna give you
a choice.
I'll give you $200,000
for 15%.
Okay.
Or I'll give you $400,000
for 30%.
Caleb and Bryan
have three offers on the table
for their Belgian waffle
business, Press Waffle,
but Robert wants to know
how much equity
they are willing to offer
if he gives them
three times the money
they are seeking.
For $600,000,
we would have
to give away an amount
of our company
that we wouldn't
be comfortable doing.
That we're not comfortable
doing.
?Yeah.
?I appreciate the offer,
and you're right ??
$600,000 is what we need
to open those stores,
but realistically,
I know you're not gonna ??
We ?? We won't give up
more than 20% of the company.
That's why debt works!
What about this?
What about $400,000
for 20%?
That's a very good offer.
That's a great offer.
Mm?hmm.
I happen to think
I'm worth more.
I hate to say it.
I'm not a braggadocio type,
but I really do.
He doesn't have
the infrastructure
for building
food businesses.
I own 16 of them.
?Bryan, she's right ?? I don't.
?A big difference.
But you know what? I think
we're gonna figure it out.
It's gonna cost him more
to figure it out with you.
I'm all about figuring
it out, Robert.
Come on.
We're gonna figure it out.
To be ?? To be totally honest ??
To be totally honest with you,
we're here for somebody
who has been there before.
Hey, guys, you know what?
I?I bought a towel that
I really didn't understand.
The company's
called Sand Cloud.
Mm?hmm.
We figured it out.
We're doing $17 million
this year.
The only other reason that I'm
hesitant about your offer is,
I think our vision lines up
more along Kevin's route
than yours.
?Yes. Yes.
?Really?
Caleb: We're not ??
Not ?? not ?? not ??
Why give up all that equity?
Not with that deal, but just
being as big as we possibly can.
Mm?hmm.
We want this to be a company
that still exists in five years.
O'Leary:
Don't give up all your equity.
You need a proven model.
Barbara, would you come down
on your equity?
To how much?
Could we do $300,000
for 15%?
Uh...
We have a deal right now.
