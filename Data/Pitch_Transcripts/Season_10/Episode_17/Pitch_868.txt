What's bothering you
about that ??
the amount of money
or the percentage?
The percentage is what we're
trying to protect, honestly.
All right.
The value of the company,
as well.
$250,000 for 15%.
That's halfway.
This waffle is talking to me
and saying, "Don't give up 15%."
It's a great deal.
Don't do it, kids.
It's a fair deal.
Don't do it.
Um...
I'm trying to do
mental math.
Yeah, so am I.
Don't do it!
We ?? That ?? That puts us
at like $1.6 million?
So, over the next 12 months,
we plan to do
$3.5 million in sales,
and of that, we plan
to net about $500,000.
I get it.
We put a simple
five times valuation on that.
That's how we got
to $2.5 million.
That's without your help.
$300,000 for 15%.
That makes it
a $2 million valuation.
Are you comfortable
with that?
Yes, I am.
Then we're comfortable
with that.
Okay.
?Thank you.
?All right, we have a deal.
?[ Laughs ]
?Congratulations, guys.
?[ Groans ]
?I hope I did the right thing.
I think you did
the right thing.
You did the right thing.
?I did the right thing
with you guys, for sure.
Thank you all.
Thank you so much, everyone!
Congrats, guys.
For what you paid,
you also get this waffle,
'cause you're
gonna need it.
Thank you very much.
[ Laughs ]
Let's go, baby!
Whoo!
Two years ago,
we didn't know anything
about the food industry,
and...
And we just got a deal, valuing
our company at $2 million
from Barbara Corcoran.
That's the American dream.
The partner we wanted.
That <i>is</i> the American dream.
That's incredible.
Hello.
My name is Janet Wu.
And
I'm Erin Wold?Fettner.
We are from San Francisco,
California,
and our company
is SilkRoll.
At SilkRoll, making
secondhand fashion mainstream
is our first priority.
There are tons of fashion
in great shape
that are just sitting
in our closets.
For example,
the average Millennial
wears an item
just three times.
So why do they all just end up
sitting in our closets?
That's because when you try
to consign or resell them,
you get screwed.
With traditional consignment ??
[ Laughter ]
What are
you looking at me for?
With traditional consignment
and resell services,
you typically get $10
for your $100 dress.
And who thinks
that's fair?
Introducing
your infinite closet.
SilkRoll.
SilkRoll.
SilkRoll is an exchange
that pays you points
for those unused clothes
and handbags in your closet.
We give you
an equivalent amount of points
to what you
initially paid,
and then you use
those points
to shop for items of
the same value on our site.
Trading clothes on SilkRoll
is easy.
You get a prepaid trading kit
in the mail,
you stuff it
with clothes you don't use,
and drop it in the mail.
Once your clothes
enters our system,
you earn points
and browse our site
to trade with other members
of our community.
You get fresh looks
delivered to your door
without paying a dime.
Oh, yeah! Money.
We are seeking $250,000
in exchange
for 3% equity.
?Oy.
?3%
?What?!
?3%!
?Why does everybody...
?Ah!
Both: So...
who wants to try us on
for size?
?Oh, my.
?Do women lie
about what they paid for the
dress that they just sent you?
We have a ?? a database
where we valuate all the items
that they send us.
Initially,
we look at the brands,
the condition, the style.
Over time,
the valuation database
actually becomes
dynamic and smart.
We'll have algorithms
that look at the supply
and demand dynamics,
and then the dresses,
or the products ??
So you're saying
you overcomplicate
a simple business.
?Actually not.
?So, this is actually great.
So, we look at Lori's dress,
and we say, "All right,
that brand
and dresses from that brand
retail at ??
in this price range."
I put together 10 items.
I ship them to you.
If it comes in damaged or ripped
or stained, what happens?
?Do you send it back?
?We don't.
If there's
a really high?luxury brand
that has any signs
of wear and tear...
Like small ?? Yeah.
...we will note that
on the site and still list it.
But what if it's cheap and
stained and you receive it?
What do you do
with the item then?
So, about 25% of the items
that we receive,
we do not keep, and we give
those products to charity.
O'Leary: What about the points?
Do I get my points?
You do not earn points
for items that we don't keep.
In fact, we deduct
a small amount of points
because you didn't do
your homework...
Oh.
...to send us
the accurate products.
?So you punish me?
?That's good. Good for you.
?You punish me.
?Janet, how do you make money?
Great question!
All right, so, let's say
you're an average customer,
and you spend $700 worth
of points on four items,
and you pay $45.
I still don't understand
how you make money.
Lori sent her the dress,
you gave her 200...
points for it.
Points, yeah.
Kevin now buys that dress...
Yeah.
...for 200 points.
Yep.
How did you make money
on that transaction?
So, Kevin paid
a 5% transaction fee to spend ??
Do I know that?
Do I know it?
Yes, you knew ?? you knew...
Yep. You know it at checkout.
Greiner:
Oh, so, anybody that buys.
Okay, so that's
the heart of this.
You keep ??
You keep 5% either way.
?So it's a commission you get.
?Yep.
?This is ??
?What's the dollar amount
on the 200 points
that Kevin spent?
What's 5%?
That's $10.
For that $200 dress.
So each point is a dollar?
Yeah, when you're trading.
You're making 5%.
No. We make 68% margins
on every order.
[ Screams ]
When do you make money?
?When Lori ??
?So ??
The moment that Lori
spends any of her points.
Yeah.
Let's say I earn 500 points,
but I want a $600 dress.
Got it.
I have to buy 100 points.
And I'm like,
"Oh, I'm 100 points short."
Then they go and buy
those points to make it up.
So, right now,
we sell points in bundles.
50 cents a point, and then
it goes to 33 cents a point,
and then 25 cents a point.
So we sold 100 points,
made $50.
Then we make another 5%
on 600 points.
Now, here's
the big question...
$250,000 for 3% ??
That's
an $8.3 million valuation.
Now, I am
the fashionista here.
?[ Laughs ]
?Not.
I'm the one that looks
spectacular all the time.
Awesome.
Cuban: Says the man who wears
the exact same suit.
He wears the same clothes
every single day.
?No, that's ??
?Every day.
?I am the fashionista Shark.
?He has 30 of the same suit.
?You have to explain ??
?All joking aside,
you're looking for 3%.
?Uh?huh.
?$250,000 for 3%.
?Okay.
This must be
a massive business.
?It ?? It is. Okay.
?Okay.
Let's get those numbers out,
ladies.
Wold?Fettner: Yes.
?Yeah.
?Yes, yes.
Wu: Okay, so, if you guys
are trying to value us
as a traditional business...
?Ohh! Here we go.
?Hold on.
This is
a very special business.
[ Laughter ]
It is. Okay?
Okay, okay.
Why won't you give us
the numbers?
Yeah, so,
we launched last year.
Okay.
And we've already traded
through the platform
$2.3 million worth of product
in points.
That means nothing.
?Yeah, that ?? Okay.
?Yeah, but you get 5% of that.
?Yeah.
?Keep going.
?You get 5% of the number?
?Your revenue is what?
So, our revenue was $35,000.
?Are you ??
?Oh.
That <i>is</i>
a very special business.
Are you out of your mind?
That is
a very special business.
Like, you're trying to tell me
you're worth $8.3 million?
?Wait.
?Wow.
?Oh, my God.
?You know I have no choice
but to eviscerate you!
?Are you serious?
Are you crazy?!
This business
is not a lifestyle business.
We're building
a marketplace
that's got a network effect.
In fact, it expands over time.
But there is
no network effect.
There is no network effect.
Actually, we do.
So, we're building
style?matching algorithms
through machine learning.
On average, a customer
trades products with us ??
But ?? But that's just
a personalization.
That's not
a network effect.
Such bad things
are gonna happen here today.
This is a business, I think,
that has two weak points.
I think your 5% commission
is not large enough
to really make much money
with this.
Secondly, I don't like
the name at all.
?Yeah, I agree.
?I don't think it has anything
to do
with what the business is.
That's a good point.
And so for
those two weak spots ??
and they're
important weak spots ??
first impression and
how do you generate revenue,
I'm out.
Cuban: Guys, look, I lived
off of consignment clothes.
My first two suits when
I started MicroSolutions,
my first company,
when I was 23,
were two for $99.
So I get it, right?
I think the marketplace idea
is great.
But what I see that I think
is ?? is a red flag is,
you talk
a lot of buzzwords ??
machine learning,
network effect,
you know, using A.I.
to do all these things
that are
very Silicon Valley,
and I'm sure
help you raise money.
You get away
from the simplicity
of what your business
should be.
It should be
just about getting users.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
You...
probably couldn't have done
a more confusing presentation.
I heard multiple streams of
revenue that you're trying.
You're ?? You're doing it on
points, you have a percentage,
when I buy points,
I get a perc??
Like, I would have
rather you come out and say,
"Look, we haven't figured out
the revenue model,
but, man,
we are growing our exchange."
?Mm.
?But I?I couldn't follow it.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Wold?Fettner: We weren't able
to effectively communicate
our numbers to the Sharks.
There was a lot of, like, all
kinds of questions coming at us,
and, you know, when we're
trying to answer this person,
that person, then the ??
the story, the wor??
the flow was jumbled.
And so confusing.
So that's why
they didn't get it. Right?
"Do I do this first or that?
Oh, what? Buy points for ??"
We hope ??
But I hope America gets it.
How much do you hate
when somebody comes in,
starts using "machine
learning," "A. I."?
?Oh, God.
?A.I. Just, yeah.
?I mean, I?I...
?Neural networks.
And they're selling dresses
with stains on them.
And their network.
No, the best part was...
[ Laughter ]
You can drain the water
without lowering your tailgate.
I like it.
Now, Sharks, the Pick?up Pool
is a brand?new product
in an untapped market.
So what do you say?
Who wants to go for a swim
and make a deal
with Pick?up Pool?
How did
you come up with this?
My inspiration
was my daughter.
?Aww!
?Aww!
