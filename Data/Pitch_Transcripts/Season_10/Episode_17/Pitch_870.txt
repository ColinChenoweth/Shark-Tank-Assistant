Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tommy Prestella.
And I'm an Air Force pilot
from San Dimas, California.
I'm here today seeking $100,000
for 25% of my company.
Now, Sharks, I love summer days
as much as the next guy.
What's not to love, right?
I mean, backyard barbecues,
evening baseball games ??
I love it all.
But, Sharks,
there's one thing about summer
that I just really don't like.
Uh?oh.
It's freaking hot!
And if you've been stationed
in the Deep South,
like I have
for the last 12 years,
or deployed overseas to Iraq,
Afghanistan, Africa,
you know that those places
get crazy hot.
I got sick and tired
of sweating through my clothes
every time I stepped outside
and just always
being uncomfortable.
Mm.
So I fused together
a creative way
to stay cool
and beat the summer heat.
Sharks, you guys
ready to cool off?
Together: Yeah.
?Boo?yah!
?Come on, Tommy!
Prestella: Introducing the one
and only Pick?up Pool.
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, as you can see,
the Pick?up Pool is the ultimate
truck?bed swimming pool.
This patented pool liner
instantly transforms
the bed of your pickup truck
into an aboveground pool.
Simply pull the corners
of the Pick?up Pool
over the corners
of your truck bed, add water,
and, bam,
you're ready for a pool party.
?Wow.
?When you're done,
there's a drain at the back.
Prestella: Way back when,
when I got the idea for this,
we were living in Arkansas.
It's 2014.
Crazy hot summer.
And my daughter says,
"Daddy, I want to go swimming,"
and I'm like ?? I'm heartbroken,
and she's heartbroken
because I don't have
a swimming pool.
So I was like, "Well..."
Aww.
I was like,
"Let's see what I can do."
I go in the garage.
I'd seen it done before.
I was, "We'll get a tarp."
I got some bungee cords.
I make this thing in the back of
my truck, and it's ?? It worked,
but it was an ugly mess.
And what if it leaks?
These do not leak.
These are
a very thick, durable material.
Lifetime guarantee on them.
It's the same stuff
aboveground pool liners are
that last 30 years.
?Wow.
?Good for you, Tommy.
First of all,
thank you for your service.
Hey, it's my pleasure.
Thank you.
What's the patent for?
So, the patent is,
it's the adaptable
watertight barrier.
I'm the only person
who can make the bed
of the pickup truck
watertight.
So, where are
you selling these now?
?So, I sell them mainly online.
?How much do you sell them for?
Prestella:
So, they cost me $110 and $117
to make for the two sizes,
and then I sell them
through my website
for $200 and $210,
respectively.
How much have you sold?
Year to date ?? $7,060.
Killing it, huh?
[ Laughs ]
Killing it.
[ Laughter ]
Lifetime sales ?? $12,000.
But there's a story there.
What's the story?
I got the idea 2014,
did a proof of concept in 2015,
bought 20 pools.
Immediately,
I got the website up,
I'm getting hits on the website,
and I'm like,
"People really like this."
I sell those 20.
I go back to get more.
Manufacturer retired.
That sucks.
So now I'm back to square one
with nobody to make the pools.
So 2016's pretty much gone
me looking for a manufacturer.
2017, deployed to an undisclosed
location in Africa.
But I had to, obviously, hit
the brakes on Pick?up Pools
'cause I was a one?man show
at the time.
So I brought my sister on.
Very responsible.
Love my sister to death.
She found me the manufacturer
who makes this.
Wow. Nice.
She ?? She's a part owner.
She's got a percentage
of the company, as well.
Good.
So...
?That's not her in there, right?
?No.
So, can I talk about her?
That's my beautiful wife
of 12 years right there.
Together: Aww!
Really?
?So...
?Whoo!
Prestella: So, supporting me
relentlessly ??
Well, who's the guy
she's fooling around with?
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
She's in a hot tub
with some other guy!
Yeah. That's my best friend
from college.
?Ohh!
?That's who that is, huh?
[ Laughter ]
So, what are
you gonna do going forward?
What's the plan?
So, the reason
I'm asking for money today,
I want to re?juice my website
and figure out how to drive
traffic to my website.
My website right now, it ??
it looks nice, but I made it.
I'm not a Web developer.
I'm really proud of myself
I made a website.
I'm like, "Wow."
I want to have a professional
redo my website.
You're basically saying
you're gonna spend the money
to market the product.
The product's in the market.
It's good quality.
$12,000 lifetime sales
since the beginning
is really abysmal.
Okay.
Well, look at it this way,
Kevin.
The guy gets deployed
to an unknown,
to?be?unnamed place
in Africa.
I get it,
but ?? but the product's ??
I got this. Thank you, Mark.
I got this one.
But, I mean, if the only way
it can sell is you, Tommy,
are, like,
barking at the Internet,
I just don't know
if people care.
You've sold
$12,000 worth of it.
Like, it's total nothing.
That's an 800% increase
from last year, Kevin.
[ Laughter ]
True story.
?Yeah, Tommy!
?Good for you.
?Good.
What do your platoon buddies
think of it?
?Ohh.
?Oh, they love it.
I've actually ??
I've brought it
to an undisclosed location
in the Middle East.
Tommy, who would work
your business?
You're still
full?time military?
I?I am married to the military
for the next eight years,
so there's no pulling the wool
over your guys' eyes here.
And so, I ?? That's ??
Yeah, but then
back to the question
of who would work
your business.
?His sister.
?My sister
is the other part of me.
Where is she based?
She's here
in Southern California.
Can you get the price ??
the cost down lower?
Thank you for asking that.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
I'm proud to say
they're 100% made in America.
Good.
It's part of the reason
why it's so expensive.
I want to make it for $25
and sell it for $60.
Right.
That's where I'm trying
to get with this.
I think there's room
to get that done a lot cheaper.
Listen, I think
you did a good job of name.
[ Sighs ]
Pick?up Pools.
Intuitive.
You got a patent.
Great job.
My problem here is, I have
no idea of the market.
I believe you ?? It would
work and keep people cool,
but I have no idea
of the market research.
Yeah, no.
Under?? Understandable.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Tommy, you're ??
you're a great guy.
I really admire the ??
the effort you've put into it.
I?I just don't know
if there's a business.
You haven't sold
very much.
You've got to find a way
to get from 20 or 30
to hundreds.
Well, think of the value you're
gonna add when you join me, Rob.
And then, all of a sudden,
we have all those resources.
You're a great sales guy.
Right?
I'm not jumping in the pool
with you. I'm out.
"Tommy, I don't think so."
I'm out
from an undisclosed location.
[ Laughter ]
Copy that.
I'm gonna make you an offer,
'cause I think it's ??
Whoa!
I think ??
I love this product.
?Didn't see that coming.
?I love it, too!
But I have
a few contingencies.
Your sister
has to be committed to it.
She is.
It has to have a salesman.
And I really have
to like your sister.
Oh, you're gonna love her.
You have to bring the price
down to under 100 bucks.
I absolutely think we can.
I believe you.
With those contingencies,
I'll give you the $100,000
for 25%.
Okay.
Tommy, is there anybody
that has a formal product
that could be ??
No, sir.
No, I am the only person
that ?? that sells this.
And you think your patent
protects you
from anybody else doing it?
Absolutely.
It's "watertight."
I don't think so. Anybody
can get a piece of plastic
and throw it
in the back of a truck.
I'll offer you $100,000
for 33%,
no contingencies,
recognizing that you're
gonna be off quite a bit.
We'll just work together
to get the price down.
I'll also get this to my guys
at Tower Paddle Board.
They can get out there
and start promoting.
That's it, Tommy.
Let's rock 'n' roll.
What do you think?
Barbara, I love watching you
on the show,
and I thank you for that...
Tommy, you have two offers.
I can't believe it!
Thank you
for that amazing deal...
Corcoran: Wait.
Wait. Just a minute.
The last time somebody
told me he loved me,
he left me
and married my sister.
[ Laughter ]
I would never do that.
I would never do that to you.
Mark, I?I appreciate...
Don't negotiate.
...that you understand
where I'm coming from.
Yeah, don't negotiate.
Let's do a deal.
?You got it.
?Ohh!
?Oh!
?Oh!
Doggone! Unh!
Herjavec: Barbara,
he's marrying your sister!
I guess he is.
And thanks for what you do.
I have no idea
if the business is gonna work,
but it was a great pitch.
?It'll work.
?Hey, pleasure to meet you guys.
?You're a great guy.
?Thank you very much. Thank you.
?Thank you for your service.
?Shock?a?roo.
?Thanks, Tommy.
Wow!
Prestella: Mark's deal
was not necessarily sweeter
in terms of money, but he
understands what my work life
is like, and he's ?? he's
willing to flex on that.
So that's why I ended up
going with Mark.
