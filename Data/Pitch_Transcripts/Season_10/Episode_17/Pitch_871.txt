...my name is Lisa D'Amato...
That's not a good way
to suck up, Lisa.
I think we'll have fun.
Okay.
My name is Lisa D'Amato, and I'm
from Los Angeles, California.
These are my boys,
Daxel and Venice.
I'm seeking $350,000
for 10% equity
in my company Dare?U?Go!
Being a mom is definitely one
of my biggest accomplishments,
but the reality of maintaining
my busy lifestyle
and work schedule
while raising
two rambunctious little boys
was making me lose my mind.
[ Babbling ]
I needed something
that would help me
quickly feed
my kids healthy meals,
and that is when
the light bulb went off.
? Ahhhh ?
[ Laughter ]
I present to you Dare?U?Go!
Dare?U?Go! is a kid?safe,
eco?friendly bib
with food storage compartments.
Parents can fill
the three compartments
with their kid's favorite foods,
and cleaning is a breeze.
You can literally just throw it
in the dishwasher.
And if the kids don't finish
what they're eating,
you can literally seal it
right back up
and save it for later.
No more waste.
Dare?U?Go!, Sharks.
?Dare?U?Go!
?Wow.
Lisa, you want
to show us the feed bags?
Wow.
You're going right there.
He just attacked!
Right there?
?Yeah.
?I don't want to have
to put you in time?out, so...
[ Laughter ]
Just give me a second.
We like you already.
Oh, I watch this show,
so I know how it goes.
Okay, Robert.
Yes?
Bam!
High five.
Here you go, Robert.
?Oh, thank you so much.
?Gosh.
?Just strap it on, Robert.
?Thank you.
I got you
some wine and cheese.
?That is absolutely great.
?Oh, wow! Listen.
?I love it.
?Yeah, it's wine and cheese.
Thanks, Lisa.
Appreciate it.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
There you go, Mark.
Ah, nice and healthy, too.
Dare?U?Go!
?Dare?U?Go!
?Yay!
Yeah.
Daxel, say "bye."
?Bye!
?Bye!
?Bye.
?Aww.
Herjavec: See you guys.
[ Boys giggling ]
Down goes Venice!
[ Laughter ]
Lisa, you must have
a ton of sales
based on your valuation.
D'Amato: Okay.
So, I have been on the market.
We've been selling
for three months.
And I've sold $100,000 worth.
Wow.
O'Leary: Three months?
Yes.
And, also, my brand,
in general, is ??
I come from reality television,
and ??
No?
Yes.
[ Laughter ]
?What were you on?
?From what show?
"America's Next Top Model."
I won the "All?Stars," actually.
?No kidding.
?Oh, congratulations.
All right,
so, let's get back to business.
Yes.
What does it cost you
to make each bag?
Per unit, it's $2.68.
All right,
and you sell it for how much?
My suggested MSRP is $22.99.
How much did you do in sales
last month?
About $23,000.
Wholesale ??
Do you have retailers
buying it from you?
There's actually
three distribution companies
that are actually having
a bidding war right now.
?But ?? But you're saying ??
?Bidding over what, though?
Just because they want ??
They want exclusivity.
I hustled hard?core.
I had the patent attorney,
and he did the nationwide,
worldwide search.
Have you been granted
the patent?
Give me one second, Kevin.
?Good.
?"One second, Kevin."
Boom.
Design or utility?
I can't see.
This is the design.
I have probably spent
about $250,000 of my own money.
Wow.
The craziest and coolest thing
about this product,
I just need you guys to know,
is obviously,
yes, we have the patents,
but, also, if you see
any other bib on the market,
their price point
is exactly the same as mine,
and it's only one function.
This is four in one.
It's food storage,
it's a plate divider,
it's got the spork in the back,
and it seals airtight.
So, let me just ??
Let me show you guys...
Is there anybody else
doing this?
No. So...
Lisa, can you tell us a little
bit more about your background?
You mentioned you're a model.
What else?
Oh, okay.
I was raised
by a very sick, bulimic mother.
[ Sighs ]
[ Clears throat ]
I didn't want to do that.
Um...
When I was young, I had
developed an eating disorder,
and modeling didn't help.
And I've been a model
my entire life,
so as far as being, like,
a weathered warrior,
I'm definitely that person.
I got through it all,
and I'm now the mom
that I've always ?? I never had,
and I couldn't be more prouder
about it.
Good for you.
Lisa, I have to ask you,
how did you get past your mother
to become a great mother?
[ Voice breaking ]
When I was at the hospital,
and they told me that,
"If you continue on this path,
you won't be able
to have children."
Mm.
And ??
And I just
couldn't have that.
My mom was not going
to define my entire life.
Mm.
There is a tenacity
that I have,
and I am going to break through
any single ?? any obstacle ever.
In fact,
to change the subject...
Let's ?? Yeah, let's ?? Lisa,
let's get back to business...
D'Amato: Yes.
...'cause
it's an interesting story,
and, you know,
you're very compelling...
It's ?? No, no, no.
That underestimates what it is.
?Yeah, it's a great story.
?It's not an interesting story.
?Yeah. That was ??
?Congratulations.
?It's a victory. Good for you.
?Good for you.
?It's ?? It's a great outcome.
?Good for you.
?Congratulations.
?But you're here
to get an investor, I think.
?Yes.
Lisa, how big
do you think it could be?
Good question, Robert!
I'm excited
to answer that question.
[ Chuckles ]
The global baby market
is supposed to reach
$121.5 billion in 2020.
Just the bib industry
within that number is 7.7%.
Got it.
Which equals...
Dare?U?Go!
...15 ?? $15 billion.
Mm.
I mean, just the bibs alone
is 7.7% of that ??
that, uh, $121 billion.
That is ??
So your logic is,
"If I enter a big market
and I get $100,000 in sales,
that values my company"?
Okay.
No, you see ?? Okay.
You guys ??
Lisa, Lisa, you lied to us.
You lied to us.
When? When?
You lied to us.
When?
You lied to us.
When?
but Mark takes issue
with something Lisa said
while pitching her kids'
bib company, Dare?U?Go!
D'Amato:
The global baby market
is supposed to reach
$121.5 billion in 2020.
Cuban:
No, you see ?? Okay.
You guys ??
Lisa, Lisa, you lied to us.
You lied to us.
When? When?
You lied to us.
When?
You lied to us.
When?
And you don't even know
you did it.
What?
You said
you watched the show.
I do.
One of the things
that we repeat over
and over and over again
is that one of the worst ways
to sell in "Shark Tank"
is to come in and talk
about how big a market is,
and if you only get
one tiny sliver of a percent,
it's a lot of money
for you.
That is a real trap that
all entrepreneurs fall into.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary: What you need
is infrastructure behind you.
Luckily, I have that.
So what I'm proposing
is this.
I'll give you $350,000,
but I'm gonna give you
$100,000 for 15%,
and the rest is debt, because
you're gonna need inventory.
That sounds great.
Now you have
to make a decision.
Do you want
to take it or not?
Does anybody want to counter?
Does anybody want to go in?
D??
So, Kevin, I love your deal.
You know, I'm start??
Does anybody want to go in?
I'm not feeling the love.
Listen,
your resilience is fantastic.
My problem is,
is it's very important
when you run a business
that you have a plan.
The creative end is great,
but you have to know
every single detail
in how to run your business,
and because I feel that
you are weaker in that area,
I have to go out.
Okay, I appreciate that.
?Lisa, just to let you know...
?Yes.
...the only offer
is from me,
and what's about
to happen now is,
I know that I become
more valuable
every time
you lose another Shark.
So now here's my new offer.
I'm gonna give you
the $350,000.
$100,000 for 20%.
It's up by 5%,
and it's gonna keep
getting worse
every time
a Shark drops out,
and the other $250,000 ??
debt.
Do you want to take it now,
or do you want to have the risk
that the next Shark
gives you another
"Kumbaya" story like that
or makes you an offer?
What do you want to do?
The best thing
I heard from you,
other than
your phenomenal charisma,
is the story
of you growing up,
because if I were
to go through every one
of my top businesses,
every one of them
is headed by an entrepreneur
that came through hell
and back.
Interesting.
?What ?? What's your offer?
Now I'm gonna tell you
what I don't like about it.
You're all over the place.
And I'm concerned
of you being half
of what a business
needs to grow.
So I think
you need a partner
that gives you
a healthy serving of control.
So I'm gonna make you
your full offer of $350,000,
but I want 50%.
?[ Whistles ]
?Ouch.
50%.
30% more than Mr. Wonderful.
Because I think you really need
someone who's a full partner
that's gonna keep you
on track and get you there.
I understand where you're
coming from, Barbara.
I really appreciate your offer.
Mm?hmm.
?Lisa.
?I think ?? I ??
You have two offers,
but I have a news flash.
50% equity.
Now my equity is 25%.
Lisa, while you're thinking,
I love your story.
You're a dynamo,
as Barbara said,
but it's just not for me.
I'm out.
I'm at 30%.
?Oh, my God.
?Wow!
?Okay. Can you ??
?You better do something.
I'm gonna change my offer,
if I may.
Can you two possibly ??
?Listen.
?I?I would never get into bed
with him.
So, I'm gonna make my offer
for 35%.
$150,000 in cash, however,
and $200,000 in debt.
?Congratulations, Lisa.
?Okay.
?Thanks. Thank you, Barbara.
?Bye?bye.
?I can't wait to talk.
?Pleasure.
So, Barbara,
I'll be sending you an invoice
for deal structure.
D'Amato: Barbara believes in me,
and that's fantastic.
A lot of times
when you go through...
[Voice breaking] tremendous
struggle in your life,
you feel very alone.
So when somebody like Barbara
connects with you,
and she ?? She's like,
"I see you,"
it's a ??
It's an amazing feeling.
