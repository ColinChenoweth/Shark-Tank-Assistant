My name is Ariel Barbouth.
I am originally from Argentina,
and my company is Nuchas.
Nine years ago,
I came to New York City
with my wife, Leni, $9,000,
this cricket
on my shoulder,
and a dream to transform
a staple
of my Argentinean culture,
the iconic empanada,
into a gourmet meal ??
so delicious, so convenient.
The concept of handheld foods
is universal.
We bring amazing recipes
from all over the world,
use some of the best ingredients
out there,
and bake them inside delicious,
edible pockets.
No plates, no forks, no fuss.
From our slow?braised
short rib
to our shrimp jambalaya
or our vegan shiitake curry,
Nuchas is on a mission
to bring the world together
through unique flavors
that remind us how delicious
our differences can be.
Sharks, you can join
the Nuchas family today
with an investment of $2 million
for 8% of all this goodness.
[ Sharks "Ohh" ]
Holy ?? What the...?
It is Nuchas' time.
O'Leary: It better be Nuchas
muchas guchas.
$2 million for 8%?
I don't want to eat it.
It's too expensive.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Do you have forks or napkins,
when you're done?
O'Leary: You don't need them.
Barbouth: Eh, I don't.
At that valuation,
you should have forks.
[ Chuckles ]
Mmm.
?Thank you.
?There.
There all different flavors.
?That's very good.
?Mmm.
?Chicken's a knockout.
?Thank you.
?So $2 million for 8%.
?Yes.
Tell us about your sales.
So this year,
we're doing $5 million.
[ Garbled ]
$5 million in sales?
In sales.
So our business
consists of two parts.
Wow.
We have our retail part.
We're the first brand
ever to open a kiosk
in the middle
of Times Square.
So that's how we started.
?That's amazing.
So how much
did you do there?
We do $800,000. It depends.
?I walk by it often.
?Yeah.
And I never stop by
because it's so crowded.
The line is so long.
?Great.
So that's a good thing.
?What a great testimony.
Currently,
we have three locations,
and we actually have a map.
Eh...all of them
are in iconic locations.
So is this business
solely that?
No.
So out of the $5 million
in sales,
$2 million are from retail
and $3 million are wholesales
to third parties.
If I were to walk up
and buy one,
what does one cost me?
So these will cost you $4.
The short rib will be $5.
And your wholesale?
On the wholesale side
of the business,
which is, really, the one
that is growing like crazy,
we're doing 44%.
It cost us $0.84 to make it,
all in,
and we sell it at $1.52.
What are you gonna make
pre?tax?
We're gonna make $750,000 profit
this year.
Wow.
And what do you think
next year?
So, next year, we're gonna do
around $12 million in sales,
and we're gonna do around
$3 million in profit.
So, Ariel, you strike me like
you're doing very well.
Why would you need
a Shark?
Now it's fulfillment.
We bought an 8,000?square?feet
facility 3 years ago.
We set up the facility initially
just to make raw products.
But currently,
we're at capacity constraint.
You need the $2 million to build
production capacity.
?We own the kitchen already.
?What ?? so ??
So we need to improve
the kitchen.
But when successful
restaurateurs
pass $2 million,
$3 million in revenue a year,
they go to the co?packer market
for capacity that you rent.
Why would you burn $2 million
into capital expenditure?
Because it never
works out.
I've seen so many of my
entrepreneurs do it.
So many.
Unless you control your
own kitchen, you never
control your business.
It never works out.
And if ?? and if I c?? can talk
a little bit about myself,
I'm a manufacturing engineer.
Like, I love ??
So you think no one else
can make these
the way you make them?
?No.
I mean, you will find
empanadas everywhere.
I think almost everybody
that comes from Latin America
has thought of starting
their own empanada business.
Yes, that's true.
I know two people.
?Everyone.
It's easy
to start a business.
It's really hard
to make one successful.
Well said.
Ariel, how do I get
my money back?
So we're growing really fast.
The opportunity's endless.
The wholesale part, we're ??
we're doing amazingly well.
We sell at gourmet stores like
Whole Foods, Gourmet Garage.
So you're not under the Nuchas
name in those stores.
You are under ?? that store
is just putting them out.
So we private label
for some of the stores.
So the idea
with this investment
is we'll bring up our
manufacturing capacity
from the current level
of 100,000 units
to 300,000 units a week.
Where are you gonna sell
the additional 200,000 units?
We've already had the
conversations,
and we've been negotiating
with ?? with some airlines,
and the capac??
?How can the airline deal
have the same margins
as the retail business?
?No way.
?It can't.
No, no. So but ??
but it's ?? the ??
Ariel, that ?? that ?? that
is just such an expensive bet.
You're talking to airlines so
you can sell 200,000 more units.
I would not approach it
that way at all.
You're asking for $2 million,
and that, effectively, is
we're all in on scaling
your wholesale business.
That's just not a ride
I?I'm willing to make.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
But congratulations on what
you've accomplished.
I really appreciate it.
How many trucks do you own?
I only have one truck.
?Only one truck?
?Cart. They're carts.
?One truck.
?Oh, I'm calling them "carts."
?The other three are kiosks.
?I'm sorry.
The retail part
is a difficult part.
It's not growing exponentially.
I do believe 100%
with the core of my soul
that this is a category
that somebody's going to own.
So, how much are you <i>losing</i>
on the kiosks?
No, we're not losing.
We're breaking even.
?How much you making, then?
?What's your profit?
?We're breaking even.
?Right, but if you ??
i?i?if you want to really
compete and have some longevity
for maybe an acquisition
or something else,
you're gonna need
to brand it
and start doing
consumer packaged goods.
That means that your margins
are going to be less
'cause now you got to do
advertising, marketing,
and other things
to support the brand.
But the way we're gonna make
more margins is wholesale.
With this $2 million,
our margins go from 44% to 55%.
Your margins are gonna go <i>down</i>
in the wholesale business,
not up.
?Yeah.
?That's what's gonna happen.
?Well ??
And I'm funding
the lower?margin business.
I don't like that.
Well, while he's thinking
about that,
um, I will share with you ??
I do think that you came in
for a <i>really</i> big ask.
$2 million for the 8% is very,
very rich for my blood.
which means, you know,
"I'm out."
Thank you.
It's delicious,
but more importantly,
I see your lines.
They're crazy.
But your numbers
are crazy, also.
I need to know that I can get
my money back in...
four years.
For my $2 million
investment,
I would have to ask for...
...25%.
?I was like ??
?I know <i>gracias</i> means "yes".
Does that mean, yes,
we have a deal?
I actually have to check.
?You talking to your cricket?
?Uh, yes.
O'Leary: The cricket?
You're talking to a cricket?
Greiner: Talk to the cricket.
Okay, don't talk to
the cricket too long
with me here, 'cause ??
No, so cricket said thank you.
It is ??
it is too much
for where we're right now.
But you do know that I'm ??
I'm investing in you,
thinking the whole brand's
gonna work.
Those wholesalers can say, "Why
are we paying so much here?
Let's just start
making our own."
You don't have
a brand in there.
It is just a delicious product
in all those retailers.
We're building this into
a $100?million business...
Ariel.
...within the next
five years or more.
?Okay.
?Ariel, would it be right to say
that your heart is in
the wholesale business
and not
in the cart business?
No.
The numbers don't say any differently.
Sure sounds like it, yeah.
Sure, but, uh, I believe
in the brand so much.
I believe in Nuchas. Like ??
?Okay, well ??
well, here's my offer.
It's a little bit odd,
but I think
it's a good deal for you,
and it's a good deal
for me.
Narrator: Two sharks are out.
Daymond has offered $2 million
for 25% of Ariel's
empanada business, Nuchas,
but Barbara is also interested.
I'll give you $1 million
for your cart business,
and I'll give you
a $1 million loan
against your real estate
on your wholesale business,
but you keep 100%
of the wholesale business.
I have no interest in that.
You're breaking even
on the carts,
whereas my Cousins Maine Lobster
on a cart
are averaging a little bit more
than $1 million a cart.
There's got to be room in there
for a profit,
and I'll buy my product
from your wholesale business,
of course.
Barbara,
are you franchising, too?
Like lobs??
uh, Cousins Maine?
Of course I'll franchise it.
That's how you make
all your money.
Thank you, Barbara,
but we're gonna be back
making a lot of money
on retail.
How many years
will it take you
to make net?net
a million dollars in cash
off those trucks
that you get
to put in your pocket
and just apply
to your business?
It's ?? It's not ??
Is it that you don't want
to lose the trucks?
I believe in what's gonna happen ??
Corcoran: And you're not
losing your brand.
You're keeping the brand.
Ariel, are you ??
are you even considering
my offer at all?
I'm looking for a partner.
?Oh, yeah.
?25%.
?It's 25%.
?Daymond, what was your offer?
?And the answer to 25%,
I cannot even, no.
I could come up to 10%.
?You what?
?I ??
?That's the room you have?
?I have ?? I have ??
But 25% is ?? it's ?? it's not
even a ?? it's ?? it's so far.
We definitely would not be
good partners,
so I'm gonna take
my deal back.
I'm out.
O'Leary: Ouch.
How much money
do you have in the bank?
I'm just trying
to figure out something.
Right now, $100,000.
That's it?
?Ooh.
?Yeah.
?He needs it.
?Ooh!
?He <i>really</i> needs it.
?Yeah.
I have $2 million
already invested in my
portfolio companies, okay?
It's making me 14%.
Now I take it,
and I give it to you.
Yeah.
I don't think I'm gonna make
14% with you.
You don't have enough cash
to do it.
I'm out.
So, I need an answer.
So the answer is
I <i>cannot</i> do it.
?Okay.
?Mistake, Ariel.
Barbouth: I would love
to get you as a partner...
Wow.
...but I?I'm not prepared
to sell our retail location,
which is really
our marketing money.
You should take her
deal, you know that?
And really think about it.
?He's not taking the deal.
It's over. Let's move on.
Barbouth: Daymond, uh, uh,
listen, we're building a brand.
25% is too much.
I'm prepared to go...12%?
?That's kind of ??
?I?I?I'm building a portfolio,
and I need the money back
in four years.
I'll be dead in five.
I need it back in four.
We're ?? So, the sales
that we have,
they're ?? they're gonna
generate enough things, like ??
No, I understand,
and you know what?
That's the best thing
about building a brand
and having yourself.
You can make
those decisions.
Yeah.
But when you have
a partner, though,
it's problematic,
so I'm out again.
?Thank you.
?Ariel, I just want to give you
one more chance to understand
the mistake you're making.
Sure. Please.
And I'm not that patient.
These are simply front offices
or windows
where I sell
your product for you,
and you don't have to do
a thing.
When we want to go
and franchise,
would I be the one
franchising, or would I ??
Is it no longer mine?
You're never
gonna franchise it.
You don't have the time.
I'm a little confused here,
so...
?It's a full?time business.
?That ??
You could increase
your wholesale business.
The <i>easiest</i> way
is to open up trucks.
But with your focus
on your wholesale,
you'll never get that done
nor the franchise done.
I'm willing
to do that work for you.
Your business will explode
because you have somebody
watching the front side.
O'Leary: But the one thing
you're missing is,
you make a million dollars.
I've never worked this hard
to spend a million dollars in my life ever.
She gives you a million dollars.
What are you gonna do?
Let's do this.
Let's do $2 million.
We go 80/20.
You take 80%, I keep 20%,
and we're partners.
So you're saying it's $2 million
for the truck piece?
It's $2 million a?and then I ??
Absolutely not.
Ariel, I think the problem
with this deal is...
Yeah.
...you asked
for too much money.
But I'm giving everything
for $1 million.
No, you're only giving
this little piece
that doesn't make any money.
But it's ?? it's ??
it's not a little piece.
Too me, it's a dream.
Your dream is in the way
of your pocketbook.
I love what you've done.
I do not believe
we're good dance partners.
I'm out.
Thank you for coming very much.
?Good luck.
?Good luck.
?Congratulations, Ariel.
?Thank you all. Thank you.
Barbouth: Just to chop my legs
right when
we're starting to soar,
they would have left us
without a purpose.
Nuchas is worth so much more.
A million dollars in cash
when he only has
$100,000 in the bank
could've been a godsend
if his wholesale business
is ready to grow.
John: Of course.
Basically, he felt like
you were turning him
into purely a co?packer.
?That's a lot of Nuchas.
?Empanadas.
?But his ego was in the way.
?No, no.
?In the end, he has heart.
?His passion, his heart.
Greiner: I think his passion,
his heart, what he built.
That's ego.
