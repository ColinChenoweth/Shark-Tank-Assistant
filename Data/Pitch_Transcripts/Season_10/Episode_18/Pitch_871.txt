My name is Ariel Barbouth.
Barbouth: Eh, I don't.
At that valuation,
you should have forks.
[ Chuckles ]
Mmm.
?Thank you.
?There.
There all different flavors.
?That's very good.
?Mmm.
?Chicken's a knockout.
?Thank you.
?So $2 million for 8%.
?Yes.
Tell us about your sales.
So this year,
we're doing $5 million.
[ Garbled ]
$5 million in sales?
In sales.
So our business
consists of two parts.
Wow.
We have our retail part.
So, Ariel, you strike me like
you're doing very well.
Why would you need
a Shark?
Now it's fulfillment.
We bought an 8,000?square?feet
facility 3 years ago.
We set up the facility initially
just to make raw products.
But currently,
we're at capacity constraint.
You need the $2 million to build
production capacity.
?We own the kitchen already.
?What ?? so ??
So we need to improve
the kitchen.
But when successful
restaurateurs
pass $2 million,
$3 million in revenue a year,
they go to the co?packer market
for capacity that you rent.
Why would you burn $2 million
into capital expenditure?
Because it never
works out.
I've seen so many of my
entrepreneurs do it.
So many.
Unless you control your
own kitchen, you never
control your business.
Ariel, how do I get
my money back?
So we're growing really fast.
The opportunity's endless.
The wholesale part, we're ??
we're doing amazingly well.
We sell at gourmet stores like
Whole Foods, Gourmet Garage.
So you're not under the Nuchas
name in those stores.
You are under ?? that store
is just putting them out.
So we private label
for some of the stores.
So the idea
with this investment
is we'll bring up our
manufacturing capacity
from the current level
of 100,000 units
to 300,000 units a week.
Where are you gonna sell
the additional 200,000 units?
We've already had the
conversations,
Ariel, that ?? that ?? that
is just such an expensive bet.
You're talking to airlines so
you can sell 200,000 more units.
I would not approach it
that way at all.
You're asking for $2 million,
?Okay.
?Ariel, would it be right to say
that your heart is in
the wholesale business
for 25% of Ariel's
empanada business, Nuchas,
but Barbara is also interested.
I'll give you $1 million
for your cart business,
?Okay.
?Mistake, Ariel.
Barbouth: I would love
to get you as a partner...
Wow.
...but I?I'm not prepared
to sell our retail location,
which is really
our marketing money.
You should take her
deal, you know that?
?Thank you.
?Ariel, I just want to give you
Ariel, I think the problem
with this deal is...
Yeah.
...you asked
for too much money.
But I'm giving everything
for $1 million.
No, you're only giving
this little piece
that doesn't make any money.
But it's ?? it's ??
it's not a little piece.
Too me, it's a dream.
Your dream is in the way
of your pocketbook.
I love what you've done.
I do not believe
we're good dance partners.
I'm out.
Thank you for coming very much.
?Good luck.
?Good luck.
?Congratulations, Ariel.
?Thank you all. Thank you.
Barbouth: Just to chop my legs
right when
we're starting to soar,
they would have left us
without a purpose.
Nuchas is worth so much more.
A million dollars in cash
when he only has
$100,000 in the bank
could've been a godsend
if his wholesale business
is ready to grow.
John: Of course.
Basically, he felt like
you were turning him
into purely a co?packer.
?That's a lot of Nuchas.
?Empanadas.
?But his ego was in the way.
?No, no.
?In the end, he has heart.
?His passion, his heart.
Greiner: I think his passion,
his heart, what he built.
That's ego.
