My name is Alex Bertelli,
Alex, show them
how easy this is.
[ Door jostles ]
Come on, Alex.
Kick it hard.
[ Door jostles ]
[ Laughter ]
Come on, Alex.
?[ Chanting "Alex, Alex" ]
?Come on, Alex. Kick it.
[ Grunts ]
How much you sell
the dead locks for?
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughter continues ]
Come in! [ Laughs ]
Well, looks like we don't need
to buy this product.
[ Laughter ]
[ Sharks "Oh!" ]
?There you go.
?[Indistinct].
?Oh, he's getting mad now.
?[ Laughing ]
Alex?
[ Panting ] Sure.
[ Laughter ]
We're gonna show you
how HAVEN works.
As you can tell, I'm not
an experienced intruder.
Greiner: Are you okay?
I'm good.
Okay.
But show them how
HAVEN works, Clay.
Yeah.
Cuban: Oh.
[ Laughs ]
HAVEN sits at the bottom
of the floor...
Best pitch ever.
...right next to
the existing threshold.
When activated, the wedge?based
barrier lifts up.
Using simple physics,
this makes your entire door
10 times stronger to
preventing home break?ins.
To use it, you simply step on
the gate to open the door.
To shut the door,
you lock it with the gate
with the foot pedal.
So, Alex,
show them how it goes.
Kick, Alex. [ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Laughter continues ]
Do the flying kick, Alex.
[ Laughter continues ]
All right, Sharks.
Oh, no.
Alex, you've just gone down
in Shark Tank history.
[ Chuckles ]
You will be memorialized
forever.
This is the connected version,
Mark.
You okay?
Hell yeah.
Here you go.
Cool.
[ Exhales sharply ]
All right, I'm gonna grab
a quick drink of water.
Clay, why don't you start?
[ Laughter ]
So, Sharks, we've got two
products that we manufacture.
We have a HAVEN mechanical ??
Mech that you have on this side.
We have
an electronic?controlled one,
That's expensive.
Banks: We think we can
get that down.
It's our ?? our first batch
of production at that cost.
Okay.
Do you have a patent
issued on this yet?
Yes, sir, we just got issuance
from the U. K.
We're still pending in ??
in the U. S., uh ??
There's nothing like this
that's on the floor
Banks:
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you, Sharks.
Cuban: Good luck, guys.
Congratulations.
Good luck, guys.
I will be a customer for sure.
I am definitely a customer, though.
Banks: This isn't our
first objection.
It is not gonna
be our last.
But there's a problem out there
we're solving,
