My name is Alex Bertelli,
and I'm a former Army
special operations
helicopter pilot
and the C. E. O. of HAVEN,
the world's
strongest smart lock.
And my name is Clay Banks.
I'm the C. O. O. of HAVEN.
We're from
Nashville, Tennessee,
and we're seeking $500,000
in exchange for 6% equity
in our business.
?6%?
?Sharks, not long ago,
Clay and I both experienced
a series of break?ins
in our neighborhoods.
In reality, a break?in occurs
every 18 seconds
here in the United States.
We quickly realized
it doesn't matter
if you lock your doors
or not.
The traditional dead bolt just
isn't getting the job done.
Let me show you.
Banks: This is your standard
dead bolt.
While it may feel secure,
when you lock it,
an experienced intruder
can get in
in about five kicks.
Alex, show them
how easy this is.
[ Door jostles ]
Come on, Alex.
Kick it hard.
[ Door jostles ]
[ Laughter ]
Come on, Alex.
?[ Chanting "Alex, Alex" ]
?Come on, Alex. Kick it.
[ Grunts ]
How much you sell
the dead locks for?
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughter continues ]
Come in! [ Laughs ]
Well, looks like we don't need
to buy this product.
[ Laughter ]
[ Sharks "Oh!" ]
?There you go.
?[Indistinct].
?Oh, he's getting mad now.
?[ Laughing ]
He took it ??
And, actually,
a break?in occurs
every 18 seconds
in the United States.
[ Laughter ]
But the doorknob's
about to fall.
?[ Laughing ] Oh, my.
?Oh.
[ Laughter ]
?Yeah!
?All right!
?That's persistence.
?Are you okay? [ Laughs ]
?This isn't going well.
?Are you ??
Typically, a break?in can happen
in less than two minutes
in the United States.
[ Laughter ]
1 in 36 homes in America
will have a break?in.
Smart locks based at
the dead bolt are no better.
Alex?
[ Panting ] Sure.
[ Laughter ]
We're gonna show you
how HAVEN works.
As you can tell, I'm not
an experienced intruder.
Greiner: Are you okay?
I'm good.
Okay.
But show them how
HAVEN works, Clay.
Yeah.
Cuban: Oh.
[ Laughs ]
HAVEN sits at the bottom
of the floor...
Best pitch ever.
...right next to
the existing threshold.
When activated, the wedge?based
barrier lifts up.
Using simple physics,
this makes your entire door
10 times stronger to
preventing home break?ins.
To use it, you simply step on
the gate to open the door.
To shut the door,
you lock it with the gate
with the foot pedal.
And you can see...
[ Door rattling ]
...there's no dead bolt here,
right?
So, Alex,
show them how it goes.
Kick, Alex. [ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Laughter continues ]
Do the flying kick, Alex.
[ Laughter continues ]
All right, Sharks.
Oh, no.
Yay!
[ Cheers and applause ]
He finally got it.
That's right, baby.
?We don't give up.
?That's right. We don't give up.
?Absolutely.
?Oh, my God.
HAVEN is still standing strong.
We've got some demos
we'll show you.
Alex, you've just gone down
in Shark Tank history.
[ Chuckles ]
You will be memorialized
forever.
This is the connected version,
Mark.
You okay?
Hell yeah.
Here you go.
Cool.
[ Exhales sharply ]
All right, I'm gonna grab
a quick drink of water.
Clay, why don't you start?
[ Laughter ]
So, Sharks, we've got two
products that we manufacture.
We have a HAVEN mechanical ??
Mech that you have on this side.
We have
an electronic?controlled one,
and Mark's got it down here
on this side.
That's pretty cool.
It's got a key fob
just like you have
with your car.
Yeah.
It also has a smart phone app,
where you can share eKEYs.
I would be able
to send you access
to my house,
schedule that.
I would get notification
when you come and go.
What does each cost?
So our cost for
the mechanical?only one,
we sell it on our website
for $182.
It cost us $67 to make it.
Our landed cost is $82.
Our profit margin
on that is 55%.
What about
the Bluetooth version?
How much?
Okay, the Connect version
we sell for $349
on our website.
Right now, cost of goods sold
is $175.
Wow.
That's a lot.
That's expensive.
Banks: We think we can
get that down.
It's our ?? our first batch
of production at that cost.
Okay.
Do you have a patent
issued on this yet?
Yes, sir, we just got issuance
from the U. K.
We're still pending in ??
in the U. S., uh ??
There's nothing like this
that's on the floor
and that stops somebody
from entering.
Our patents actually cover
the entire door
and for sliding doors.
So, could you do it
at the top, too?
Yes, ma'am.
So that's the other
exciting thing
we want
to tell you about,
is, due to recent
current events
schools started
approaching us
to put this in individual
classrooms.
Oh, wow.
Huge market.
There's over
115,000 schools
in this country, and classrooms ??
This is to protect
the classroom
from anybody getting in?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Our plan is to lock down a
classroom within one second
and give teachers access
and give, uh,
security resource officers,
SWAT team access
to the lock.
It's actually
a really good idea.
That's a great idea.
I don't think you told us
what our ??
your sales were.
Okay, so,
so far, we just crossed
the $250,000 mark
of ?? of total sales.
Where are you
selling them?
We sell online on our ??
on our own website.
How much money have you raised,
and how much debt do you have?
We've raised $1.5 million.
There you go.
?There it comes.
?Oh, that's a lot. Wow.
And how much debt
do you have, if any?
We have, uh, two,
uh, investors
with a convertible note debt
of ?? a total of $500,000.
Here we go.
Are you two the sole owners,
be?? besides the ??
We currently own 25% each,
and then we have investors
on top of that with additional
equity to sell.
So the school situation ??
what is it that you have
underway with schools?
Yes.
Tell them about the purchase
order we got in Arkansas.
So, in ??
in Melbourne, Arkansas,
we installed three locks
about a month ago.
They had an open house.
The parents loved it.
The next day, I got a call from
the superintendent and said,
"I've got 94 classrooms
left to do in this school.
I want to put in an order."
?Nice.
?That's a big order.
?You got the purchase order?
Did they order ??
did they order 94?
Yes, ma'am.
What are you gonna
do with the money?
Sure, so our biggest problem
is inventory, simply.
So we're gonna use part
of your investment
to go out and scale inventory
with our suppliers.
Guys, look, I think what
you've done is brilliant.
Well, Mark, let's ??
let's do a deal.
But the challenge is
that your economics are awful.
Your margins are awful
to support what you ??
what you need to do.
We're ?? We're just starting
our manufacturing.
We have made 2,000 locks
and got those
into the customers.
We paid way over
for those first 2,000.
We're not gonna pay that
for the next 10,000
or the next 20,000.
I think you're gonna have
a?a pretty hard time
figuring out how
to get to scale
and figuring out what works
and what doesn't.
I don't want to be part
of the journey.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you for your time.
Corcoran: I think you have
a huge mountain to climb
and something that I don't think
we'd get our money back,
so, for me, I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate your time.
Thank you for the pitch.
Yeah, guys, I just think
it's gonna be difficult,
particularly from
a cash?flow perspective.
It's gonna take you
raising your price, you know,
to generate the margins
until your costs come down,
and even then, the ?? the
margins just aren't there, guys.
I'm out.
Sure.
Greiner:
I think this is really smart.
The problem for me is I like to
really understand a product
when I invest in it,
and you might be too early.
I can't invest at this point.
So I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you very much
for your time.
You know what?
Come on, Daymond.
Let's do a deal.
I'm very interested in it,
but sometimes it's ??
it's what's in the best interest
for the entrepreneur, too.
I can give you a Shark deal,
then you may have
to raise more capital,
and then you get diluted.
Well, give them something
to start with.
What do you want to ??
?Let them decide.
The only reason we're here
is to get one of you
on this team to guide us,
to mentor us,
to get us into
distribution opportunities
and help scale
our costs down.
We want you on this team.
You're not gonna like
what I'm gonna say
because me taking more of
the company than you own
is not in your best interest,
and I need you to be
a little selfish for yourself.
So I'm not gonna
give you an offer.
I'm out.
Banks:
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you, Sharks.
Cuban: Good luck, guys.
Congratulations.
Good luck, guys.
I will be a customer for sure.
I am definitely a customer, though.
Banks: This isn't our
first objection.
It is not gonna
be our last.
But there's a problem out there
we're solving,
and we're gonna
keep going after it.
We're gonna continue on.
Uh, t?the team follows the motto
that I lived in the Army.
We're never gonna quit.
We have paying customers
out there,
not only residentially
but commercially,
and we're gonna keep going.
The impact that "Shark Tank"
has had on my business
has been truly profound.
Barbara's mentorship gave me
the skills I needed
to not only sell my first
invention, AVA the Elephant,
all over the world,
but to now own and operate
a full product?design
and distribution company.
That is pretty incredible.
