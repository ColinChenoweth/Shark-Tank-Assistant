Hi, Sharks. I'm Logan.
I'm Austin.
And I'm Teddy, but y'all
can call me Hops,
and we're from Clemson,
South Carolina.
Our company is Kanga, and we're
seeking a $100,000 investment
for a 10% equity stake.
At Kanga, we're all about
cold drinks and convenience.
Speaking of cold drinks,
take a look at this cooler.
I take this thing with me
everywhere.
Since it weighs 50 pounds
and costs hundreds of dollars,
I can't afford to go to the gym,
and I don't need to.
This is my workout.
Both:
He thinks he works out.
[ Laughter ]
But the best part
about it
is that it keeps my beer cold
for two whole weeks.
Hey, man, if it takes you
two weeks to finish your beer,
we've got to have
a separate conversation.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't know about you,
Sharks,
but that doesn't sound
convenient to me.
But there's always
option number two.
My good friend, the old,
trusty, Styrofoam cooler.
Cuban: Oh.
Ohh.
[ Laughter ]
That's definitely
not convenient,
but do you know what is?
The Kanga Kase Mate.
The Kase Mate is a
patent?pending insulating sleeve
made to wrap around
a cold case of beer or soda
and keep it cold
for up to seven hours
without ice.
And trust me, Sharks,
it's way cooler than a cooler.
It's like a can insulator
for your case of beer,
and using it is easier than
Mr. Wonderful washing his hair.
Ooh.
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughing ] So corny.
All you have to do
is go over to the fridge,
grab a cold case
of beer or soda,
slip it into the Kase Mate,
zip it up,
then you're ready to go.
Think about it, Sharks.
If the case of beer
is already cold
when you get it,
why not just keep it cold
the entire time
you're actually
going to drink it?
Don't let the struggle with ice
make your good time not so nice.
We're Kanga.
?All right.
?[ Laughs ] Good job.
We're flipping excited
to be here.
And we know you'll be
flipping excited, too,
when we give you
your very own custom Kase Mate.
Who wants a beer?
?We do.
?We do.
?Here you go.
?Mr. Wonderful design.
?Thank you.
?Aww, thank you.
?Barbara.
?Whoa.
That's what I like.
Here you go, Mark.
There you go.
Oh, that's cool. I can get it
from just opening up the top.
Oh.
Very nice.
Hey, cheers to Season 10.
?You got it.
?Thank you.
?That's right. Cheers.
?That's what's up.
?Cheers.
?Cheers.
There's a lot of different
things that keep beers cool,
as you've pointed out here.
Very competitive market.
Do you have any sales?
We sure do.
Uh, we actually have
$103,000 in sales.
We've only been in business
for about six months.
Six months?
Mostly in Clemson,
or where are you selling them?
So we have two main
distribution channels.
The first is our e?commerce,
which we launched a Kickstarter
that ran for two months.
That's done about 30%
of our sales.
The other 70% of our sales have
come from our "B"?to?"B" route,
or custom wholesale,
as we like to call it,
where we partner with companies
that want to have their logo
featured on our product.
How did you come up
with this?
Lawrence: So, we actually
created this idea
as a part of a class project
at Clemson.
We had to create a solution
for a problem we faced.
So I'm sitting there on game day
in Clemson, South Carolina,
drinking warm beer from a case.
Why was I drinking warm beer
from a case?
Me and all my buddies
had coolers
that cost hundreds of dollars
and keep our beer cold
for a week.
Why couldn't we use it
for a couple hours?
Well, the reason was we had
to walk a mile and a half
to the tailgate
from our apartment.
We didn't want to take the big,
bulky cooler with us,
deal with all the ice.
So we just stopped by a
convenience store on the way,
grabbed a case, and drank it
as it got warm.
So we found the problem, but
where was the solution?
And that's when I started
looking around.
I saw at a tailgate next to us,
somebody took a cold beer
from a cooler
and put it in a can insulator.
That's when it hit me.
Why don't we have the same thing
for the entire case of beer?
How long does it stay cold?
Seven hours.
So how much do you
sell this for,
custom and ??
and just off the shelf,
and what's it cost you?
We sell at retail,
the 12?pack, for $29.95,
the 24? and 30?pack for $34.95,
and our custom channels average
about $20 per unit.
Now, our cost of goods average
$6.10, and $3.50
is how much it costs us
right now to land it.
We know we can get ??
Okay, $9.60 total.
?Yeah.
?What's special about the lining
on the product that
keeps it cold,
or is it like every other
thermos lining?
What's really exciting,
actually,
about this entire package
is, intuitively,
the actual cardboard case adds
some level of insulation.
So it's t?the combination of
that cardboard casing then a s??
a liner that acts as
a?a watertight barrier
and, uh, prevents any air
from getting in and out.
And then the foam layer
actually adds a little bit
of an air gap to it.
We have two patents filed.
We're pending on both.
There's a channel you haven't
talked about, which is going to
the beer companies
themselves.
I'm glad you asked.
So we were actually
approached
by the largest brewery
in the world,
and they wanted
to put their logo
for their three top brands
all over our product.
As of last week, we have
a purchase order in hand
from Anheuser?Busch.
?That's fabulous.
?How much?
It's for $16,000.
It is a test market only,
but they have expressed that
if they like these units,
they want to order 10,000.
Corcoran: Good for you.
How much money have you
put into the business?
So, personally, we've all
put $833 into the business.
[ Laughter ]
John: Nice!
We're broke college students.
We do what we can.
Yo!
Maxwell: We're swimming ??
we're swimming in student loans
right now, and, uh, I just
graduated in December,
and Logan just graduated
a couple weeks ago.
This show, actually,
has inspired me
to pursue entrepreneurship.
So I'm a diehard fan.
I'll be honest.
I've seen every episode.
I've seen your bald head
plenty of times, Mr. Wonderful.
[ Laughter ]
And ?? and I love it.
And I love it.
So, back ?? back in Season 6,
in October of 2014,
I was watching
a live episode,
and I saw a company come on
and make a deal.
Uh, I actually
called the CEO
the night
that the episode aired
to explain to him how I could
provide value to them,
and I worked my way up with this
company from a customer
to a brand ambassador
to an intern.
And after turning down
multiple engineering offers,
I decided to pursue that
company full?time.
Are you gonna name
the company?
It's a "Shark Tank" company?
Sure.
It's BeatBox Beverages.
I would've guessed, yeah.
?Oh.
?Great guy.
The craziest thing about it
is now I'm up here
and have the opportunity
to present to you guys
with my own company,
and this has already been
a dream come true for me.
Good for you.
And I hope that I'm able
to inspire other people
that are going down
a similar path as I am.
?That's great.
?That's good news.
All right, guys,
you know what?
I've done every beer and alcohol
that's come on here.
I'll make you an offer.
All right? It's not a
negotiation, just an offer.
You say yes or no.
I'll give you the $100,000,
but I want 20%.
Yes or no?
You got a deal!
Let's do it!
[ Laughter ]
?Let's do this.
?Thank you, Mark.
?Yes, sir.
?Let's make it happen.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Thanks, Mark.
?Thank you guys so much.
?Thank you.
?Thank you guys so much.
?Thank you so much.
Lawrence: Anybody watching this,
we were in your shoes
a year and a half ago,
and now we're here.
Anything can happen.
Just believe in it.
Go for it.
Be crazy enough to do
something about it.
