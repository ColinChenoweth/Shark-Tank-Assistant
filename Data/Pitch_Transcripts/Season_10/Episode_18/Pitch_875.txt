That's pretty cool?looking.

Please tell us
they're related to you.
?Oh, my God.
?Oh, my goodness.
That's good theater.
All right, Sharks.
Who's ready to join
the unstoppable
CertifiKID family
on our awesome ride?
Together: Whoo!
?How do you find the events?
?Okay, I'm ??
O'Leary: I'm very interested.
If I live in Fargo,
do I have activities
around my town?
No, you do not.
Not at this point.
We are currently in
Washington, D. C.,
Baltimore, Chicago, L. A.,
Philadelphia, and Atlanta.
?That's ?? That's sizable.
?Which is your biggest city?
Washington, D. C., we're huge.
That's where we're based.
That's your ?? That's where
you're from? Okay.
Yeah.
How do you make your money?
So, when a business
signs up with us,
there's no cost to them.
We take a percentage on
each sale that's sold.
So customers are buying
through our website.
They'll buy a voucher
for a farm festival.
Say it's $15.
They'll pay $10.
We, then, would pay the
business, for example, $5.
So you're,
effectively, Groupon
for a very specific market,
a family market.
Family niche and mom niche,
in particular.
What made you come up
with the idea?
Tell us a little
about this history.
I was running a?a blog
on the side for fun
that was geared to deals,
and, deep down,
I always wanted to
have a business,
and I was putting away money.
And I told him about this
new daily deal concept,
but it was only spas and
restaurants at the time.
And I said,
"Wouldn't it be awesome
to have a site like this
but geared to moms?"
Keep in mind, I had no
business background,
no I. T. background,
no marketing, no sales,
nothing.
You were a stay?at?home mom
at that time?
My background is
criminal?justice
security management.
Of course it is.
[ Laughter ]
John: Why not?
?Perfect fit.
?Interesting.
You have a kid that's out of
line, you put him in prison.
?Yeah.
?I'm curious.
What ?? What is your
background?
Um, I'm a lawyer.
My focus is mainly
high?level business,
strategic, financial.
Brian, if you're
the finance guy...
But you still have
a job as a ??
...what's the revenue?
This year,
more than $5 million.
?Good for you.
?What?!
But those are gr?? that's your
gross numbers, right?
?That is our gross numbers.
?You sold $5 million worth
of tickets to stuff,
and you kept how much?
Our net income from
that number this year
projected to be
about $700,000.
?Nice.
?Wow.
No ki?? I thought this
was poo?poo on a stick.
Hold on, how about this?
Since we launched in 2010,
we have generated more
than $30 million in sales.
?Wow.
?Wow.
Have you cut any deals with
the toy companies for products?
So, that's the other side
of the business
is that,
in the last three years,
we added a new element
of the business
where we were doing
paid advertising.
So that's opened up this
enormous revenue model for us.
How often do you send
your newsletter out?
Every day.
We have over a million
subscribers.
Wow.
I would say about
half of those
are, you know,
super engaged.
What's your open for
a typical daily open?
It's a 10% open,
14% click?through.
?That's nice.
?Not bad.
Yeah.
Have you brought
any capital
in from anybody else?
No, we were profitable
after our third month
with the seed money that Jamie
was hiding away for ??
for her business.
Congratulations.
Why do you think you
need an investment?
You've been profitable since
three months opening.
Yes.
Family?run business.
Yeah.
Why would you want
more capital right now
if you can grow
without having to worry
about anybody else
but the family?
The safe thing for us to do
would be to not be here.
Keep doing what we're doing.
It's a great family business.
Right.
We're doing well.
My father passed away about
a year and a half ago.
?I'm sorry.
?Sorry.
Um, he used to say,
"Don't have regrets."
He regretted a lot
of deals he didn't do,
and I think we feel,
at this point in time,
what we see as a strategic
partnership with a Shark
to help guide us
to help us grow the business.
What would
the $600,000 go for?
So, we would use
the $600,000 to help support
our marketing?and?sales
strategy,
which would include
growing our sales team,
and also helping us grow
our subscriber base
through customer acquisition.
Cuban: Yeah, that ?? guys,
that's your challenge.
Making $700,000 is no joke,
but the hardest challenge
is refreshing content,
particularly when you have
long?term customers...
Right.
...you know, because they
love it, love it, love it,
and then, "What have you done
for me lately?"
I just think that ??
that's a big a hurdle.
I?I don't see the valuation
matching that challenge.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that,
but thank you.
I believe that, you know,
after eight years of, uh,
making newsletters,
you've already figured out
something, right?
I would offer you $600,000
for 17.5%.
Thank you so much
for that offer.
We really appreciate it.
I think you're overlooking
a tremendous potential
in your business.
I'm interested in a deal,
but only if you believe
in the philosophy that
I see in the business,
which is to turn it
into a franchise.
I think you can make a killing
as a franchise business,
because I think
there are so many moms
who want to be involved
in a mom business
where they're in charge.
Not working for you,
but running their own business.
So I'll make you an offer
for the $600,000,
but I want I want 25%.
Ooh.
But the contingency is,
for your sake and for mine,
to turn it into a franchise.
I could make you a fortune.
?Uh...
?Do you capture any data?
For example,
birthdays of the kids.
We ?? That's something
we've discussed.
That is something ??
You haven't done that yet?
Currently, no.
Well, if you had
the birthdays
of the kids,
and I have Lovepop cards,
I need to know that...
Yeah.
...so I can pay you
to give me that data
and sell that product.
Right. I ??
That's where I see huge
opportunity, as well.
'Cause if ?? A lot of these are
birthday gifts to kids, right?
Right, yeah.
No, no, I think there could be
a whole birthday program.
It's something ??
it's on my list.
Wow. There's so much ??
there's a lot of opportunity
in ?? in data mining for you.
Right, yes, yes.
Brian: Absolutely.
I don't see
the franchising thing.
I don't agree with Barbara
at all on that.
I think you're mistaken.
I think you want to
control that database,
'cause that's where
the value is.
I would do the deal,
but on the exit,
here's what I'd like,
because you may be
taking more money
down the road,
and, again, I have no control
'cause I'm a minority
shareholder.
I want to make sure
whatever happens,
I get three times on my money
on the exit.
So I'm gonna help you
build this thing up.
I've got two or three companies,
I think, that would buy this
if the database
got a little better.
Look, if you guaranteed me
three times on my 600K
if there's an exit,
I'd give you the 600K for 20%.
Barbara hasn't thought enough
about it to figure that out.
Uh, let me tell you,
I'm not so stupid.
I don't know what
he's talking about.
I'm not as complicated.
$600,000 with 17.5%,
not all this other crap
they're talking about.
And I'll share with you.
I love you both, but
I kind of feel like you
shouldn't bring in a partner.
I ?? It's just my opinion.
What are you ??
What are you ??
What are you talking about?
Mind your business.
Just my opinion.
I think you have some
very good offers here.
You're doing so amazing.
I feel like you're better off
not giving away equity,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
So, you still have
three viable offers.
Time to make a decision.
What do you want to do?
but Brian and Jamie have
three offers on the table
for their daily deal business
for moms and kids, CertifiKID.
Time to make a decision.
What do you want to do?
Kevin, I'd like to counter
to you at $600,000 for 15%.
Look, if I give you $600,000,
I'm gonna work like hell
to make sure I get it back.
I will work with you
to make this big.
Eventually,
you're gonna want to sell it,
no question,
and I get you a huge exit.
That matters to me.
I know what I'm worth.
Would you drop
your contingency?
When you invest in us,
you're gonna get returns
in year one.
You don't need to guarantee
yourself a three times ??
You're gonna get profits
next year, immediately.
Jamie: Tomorrow.
[ Chuckles ] I mean ??
Tomorrow. Trust me.
We have built a phenomenal
business here.
Let's see how
flexible you are.
Meet me in the middle.
I want 20%,
and you're saying 15%.
17.5%, and we have a deal.
Will you drop
your contingency?
No.
The contingency's
a killer.
Kevin, you can do this deal.
$600,000. We c??
I'm starting to like you,
you know?
[ Laughter ]
I think you can do ??
I think you can do
this deal at 15%.
You came in here for Kevin,
so I?I'm gonna take my offer
off the table.
Oh, you're like a sore loser.
My God.
Oh, interesting.
I'm not. I don't want ??
Listen ??
You're like a baby.
Brian, how about this?
They came here for
somebody, Barb.
How about th??
how about this?
Y?You're a baby.
I'll stay at 20%.
I remove the pref down
to just one times.
I get my money back
when we sell it.
I'm not asking for
a profit on that.
We ?? We cannot do that.
Kevin, I think you can
do the $600,000 for 15%
without the contingency.
No.
It's an amazing deal.
Amazing deal.
Kevin, this ??
[ Laughing ] You know that.
We are gonna ?? don't not do ??
we are gonna ??
Hey, we're a deal company.
I love you. I love you.
This would be
the best deal you do.
Imagine ?? Imagine ??
It will make you
money immediately.
Brian, if you're asking me
to take the preference off,
it's got to be 20%.
You get the 600K for 20%.
Let's roll.
I like your negotiating style.
You're honest, you're fair,
but I'm stuck with a line
in the sand here.
You know, great deals,
both walk away
having given something up.
Those are great deals.
I'm already crying.
Kevin, we can't ??
You know, tonight, I'm gonna get
under my bed and cry
about my preference.
No, we are gonna
make you money.
I'm a Shark. I'm a Shark.
I know, and we're gonna
make you money.
And we're giving you
a phenomenal premium
on this money.
$600,000 ??
Brian, $600,000, 20%,
done, no preference.
Ready? Let's go, buddy.
Kevin, $600,000.
We will incr??
we'll go to 17.5%
17.5%, your number,
no preference.
We will make you money.
You can do this.
20%. No preference. Done.
You can do this.
This is a great deal
for you.
I'm fighting for this deal.
I'm loving you.
I'm loving you.
You ?? yes.
So do it.
Brian, done deal.
20%. No preference.
My family is gonna come
in here and tackle you.
Do this deal. 17.5%.
[ Laughter ]
You can do it.
No preference. 17.5%.
Brian, do not walk out of
the Shark Tank for 2.5%.
Oh, my God.
Don't send us out
of here for that.
Come on.
Don't send us out of here.
We're stuck.
[ Chuckles ]
18.5%.
No. 19%. Done.
?Done.
?[ Laughs ]
We'll say it. We'll say it.
She's ?? she's got to say it.
Say what?
"It's a deal."
It's a deal.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughter ]
Mazel tov.
Thank you.
?Congrats, guys.
?Kevin, we're gonna kill it.
[ Laughter ]
?I'm loving it.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Well done.
?Thank you. Thank you.
Brian: It was so amazing
to get three offers,
but we really think
Kevin gets our business,
and we think that
he has the potential
to take us to amazing
new heights.
