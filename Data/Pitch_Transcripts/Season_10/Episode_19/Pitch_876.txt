Killian: How much money
would it take you
to let the Shark
next to you...
[ Clippers whir ]
...give you a haircut.
?I'm in.
?You got to be kidding.
[ Laughs ]
You know, I made
a lot of mistakes
in this business, Kevin.
?You don't say?
Greiner: I got good news
and bad news.
I'm gonna give you
the good news.
There's four other Sharks.
?Oh, Lord.
Hey, Sharks.
My name is Dan Killian,
and I'm looking for $100,000
in exchange for a 20% stake
in my company today.
But to tell you
a little about myself,
I just turned
31 years old,
I quit a phenomenal job
after 9 years,
and I did
the one thing
that every
30?something?year?old
can only dream of.
Hey, Dan!
I baked some cookies
for you and
your Shark friends.
Oh, yeah! I moved back home
with my parents, guys.
So come on in.
Great.
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, I realize this is
a funny conversation
all loving families
and friends have,
and it always involves
something that
each of you know
very, very well.
?Money!
?Money!
Killian:
That's right, parents.
Like when someone says,
"I'll give you 10 bucks if
you eat that off the ground,"
or that friend that calls
after a bad day and says,
"I swear, if someone
gave me $1,000,
I would call my boss and
I'd quit tonight, no problem."
Or you might wonder as you sit
there comfortably,
"How much money would it
take you right now
to let the Shark
next to you"...
[ Clippers whir ]
...give you a haircut.
?[ Laughs ]
?Now, if you're thinking about
that dollar amount,
Sharks,
you're what I call
a "Pricetitute."
[ Ding! ]
We did not
raise him that way.
[ Laughs ]
So I took these conversations
everyone's already having,
started a business,
and turned that into a game.
It's called...
[ Register dings ]
...Pricetitution.
You guessed it.
So, this game is actually
one of the best ways
to get to know more
about new and old friends.
And, no ?? to answer
your first question,
you don't actually
have to do any of this stuff.
You're only guessing
how much money
it would take them
to do this.
So to better understand
one another
and help people connect
and at the end of the day,
to make my roommates
proud of me,
what's your price?
?[ Laughs ]
?All righty.
So, I'm gonna grab a card,
and I'm gonna take you through
kind of how to play it
and the details on it,
and then my parents, since you
are in our home right now ??
we're gonna pass you out
some cookies and some milk.
[ Laughs ] You know
the way to our hearts.
?What do we have here?
?These are sugar cookies.
?Oh, how cute!
?Perfect. Thank you so much.
?Thank you so much.
?Are you really the parents?
?We are.
?We are.
Killian:
So, you might not be
exactly happy
about that, right?
And what's gonna happen
is the rest of the Sharks,
the rest
of the players here,
are gonna guess your lowest
possible dollar amount
to have to do that.
Kevin's also gonna write down
his lowest possible
dollar amount
very, very honestly
to have to do this,
and whoever is closest
wins that round,
and then
they get one point.
Now, we're gonna
take a second
before we just write down
arbitrary numbers,
and we're gonna ask
a few questions.
Okay.
Kevin, what happens
when you have wet socks?
Do you absolutely hate it?
Do you just kind of hate it?
Can you deal with it?
Oh, I?I think
it's really miserable,
and it's very bad
for fungus
and all kinds
of other issues.
So you have health concerns
beyond discomfort?
Health concerns.
Absolutely.
?Kevin is the fungus among us.
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: Dan, tell us
about your background.
What were you doing
before you came up
with this stupid idea
and moved in
with your parents?
My background is
I'm a psychology major,
I have a background
in improv comedy,
and I worked
at a creative ad agency
for about nine years.
That's what I just quit
to make this.
I did a Kickstarter
on this, uh, last year,
sold a bunch over the holidays.
?What's "a bunch"?
?What's "a bunch"?
?I hate "bunch."
A bunch? Uh, so with only
two months of active sales
and also focusing this entire
year on licensing offers,
which I have received
a couple ??
Wait a minute, there.
Sales are
at about $40,000.
So, tell Mr. Wonderful about
the licensing opportunity.
So, the largest
toy manufacturer in the world
reached out to me,
and the largest playing card
manufacturer in the world
reached out to me.
?What?
Where does that stand now?
So, I ended up, um,
not going forward
with both of those ??
Wait a minute.
?Whoa, whoa.
?Danny, honey, sweetie, bootsy.
Greiner: Maybe they weren't
offering enough.
The challenge was that
they wanted to put this game
into a game subscription
mail?order box.
Greiner: Oh.
So that's gonna be something
that's going out
every few months.
It's gonna be $50?plus.
If you look at a game like this,
and you think about the ??
the target, which is
a social, casual player,
they're not gonna be buying into
something that's 50, 60 bucks.
You were smart not to do that.
What was the other one.
Nah, that's the dumb one.
?What's the other one?
?So, the other one was ??
Actually, I got
an above?average advance offer.
I was actually almost gonna
go forward with it,
'cause they were gonna actually
make it their flagship game.
They said it was
the highest?tested ??
Whoa!
No wonder
you dad looks so sad.
?Right.
?[ Laughs ]
The reason I didn't
go through with it
was because
they insisted on having
a perpetual exclusivity
of $1,000 a year
without guaranteeing
any minimum sales.
But all you need is
of Dan's socially interactive
game, Pricetitution.
Maybe it has some potential.
Dumb or not?
Oh, if you're asking me,
I'm gonna go with "not."
?Yeah.
?That's gonna be my ??
That would be
a good response.
For sure, yeah.
Look, I sold
my first company
to the world's largest
toy company,
then I worked there
for two years.
I've seen how difficult
it is for people
to actually get distribution.
Very, very hard.
That's why many of them
do the license deal,
and if it has merit,
the market decides.
So I'll give you the $100,000.
I want 50%.
Oza: Oh!
?And we're partners.
?I appreciate that offer.
Um, it is, obviously,
higher than
what I was looking for, but ??
?It's an outstanding offer.
And I think your parents
would like it a lot.
?So, Dan, so...
?Yes?
...the game this reminds me
the most of
is Cards Against
Humanity.
Mm?hmm.
Sure.
Do you know how big
those guys have become
and what they've sold?
?Yeah, I can ??
I can tell you this.
Estimated sales for them
projected on Amazon
each month, uh,
are about, uh ??
They sell 100,000 units
is what is projected on Amazon.
Wow.
I have a pretty damn
good background
in building brands.
Yep.
I think that you have
a great name here
that could be built
into a brand.
Okay.
And since Kevin is
trying to gouge you...
?Yeah.
?...I'll be nicer.
I would say $100,000
for 40% of the company.
Thank you for your offer.
Believe me, Mr. Wonderful's
worth the extra 10%.
I can guarantee you that.
So, you got two offers
on the table.
I don't know what
everybody else is doing?
Mom and Dad, believe it or not ??
Greiner: Listen, listen!
Hear ye, hear ye!
I'll walk you into
the biggest retailers
within 24 hours.
?Sure. Thank you.
?The minute I saw this...
But it's not standing
around long.
...and understood it.
Yeah.
Truly, in my mind,
I was like, "Add to cart."
Like, I like it.
I'm gonna offer you
the $100,000,
also for 40%.
?Ooh.
?Ooh.
?I like the game...
?Yeah.
...but I already know that,
reading some of these,
that somebody
would do it,
and then
I would get sued.
Literally, where somebody
would read it
and then the media
would say,
"Mark Cuban encourages
someone to have a sex tape."
And so for the craziest reasons
in the world,
I'm out.
Okay. Thanks for
your time, Mark.
Corcoran: I'd like
to make an offer,
but it comes with
a contingency.
Okay.
Oza: Oh, boy.
What I don't like
about this game
is it's in a box.
The key to this game
is let your consumer
make up the questions.
Picture you getting
2,000 wild?ass questions,
some of them obscene,
some of them ridiculous.
It's fodder
for social media.
I would like to make
an offer, again, for 50%,
'cause I think
it's gonna take a lot of work
to do what I think ??
Oh, you're so greedy.
...to take it where I think
it should go,
which it should
be entirely online.
Four offers, Dan.
Mom and Dad,
can you believe it?
What are you gonna do, Dan?
?You know what?
The power of two
is always greater
than the power
of one bald.
?Mm?hmm.
?[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ] Lori and I feel
we could make something
out of this
pretty damn big.
We'll ??
$100,000 for 40%,
but we'll come in together.
We'll split it.
But you got to make
the decision...
Would you ??
...real quick.
Well, I appreciate
all the offers on the table,
first of all.
I really do.
Would, uh ?? Would either
of you come down just 5%?
With how much money
you're gonna make,
you're not really gonna
care at all about that 5%.
That's the point.
Honestly, you're just
gonna be going...
That's fair.
..."cha?ching, cha?ching,
cha?ching."
That's fair.
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna do a quick look
for the parental?advisor
roommate check.
You have to. Mom and Dad,
give him the ??
And then ?? And then I'm gonna
look back at all of you.
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
?Lovely!
?Congratulations, Dan.
?Yay!
?Thank you very much.
?I love it. It's so cute!
?Yeah. Thank you very much.
Look at the pride
at Mom and Dad's face.
?Yeah.
?Thank you very much.
?Aww.
?Congratulations, Mom and Dad.
?Congrats, Dan.
?Thank you so much.
Appreciate your time.
Thank you. Thank you.
Congrats, Mom.
Congrats, Dad.
Thanks for
the cookie and milk.
53 out of 53
in attendance
indicated that they wanted
to bring the Flip?It! in.
So we did all
of the new vendor paperwork,
and we're waiting for the order
and waiting for the order.
?And?
?They don't have an answer.
They just don't have an answer.
?That's called a "no."
?It's like they're paralyzed.
?That's called a "no."
?Well, they want to take it.
?But wait.
Then why don't they send you ??
?But what is ?? Okay.
Everybody's too busy
trying to reinvent themselves
trying to catch
the market leader.
No! That's the world's
worst excuse ever.
You sound like Mr. Wonderful
right there, as well.
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh, please.
Don't sully the Wonderful
brand that way.
This happens on
"Shark Tank" so often.
Peel the onion back,
and you find out
that you have
not embraced the "no."
that has natural
antioxidants.
So with Luma, you get all
of that sweet, delicious flavor
of a regular soda with only
a tiny fraction of the sugar.
And it's delicious.
[ Can pops ]
Ahh!
But where are
my manners?
I have delicious samples
for all of you Sharks to try.
?Cool.
?Now I'm really intrigued.
We have four flavors,
and I, uh, wanted each of you
to be able
to try all four.
Oza: Oh, wow,
we have two colas ??
cherry and
a regular, huh?
That's right ?? Cherry Cola
and regular Cola.
?No. Professional guidance.
?I mean, look ??
I have made
mistakes, and ??
O'Leary: No, and ??
and everybody here
appreciates the honestly
on that.
But, you know, this is
now the real world.
This is investing.
You're asking for $500,000.
That's not a small
amount of money.
I actually think you should
take the $1.7 million hit
and move on.
Every investor here
has made mistakes.
Yep.
I don't have
a perfect portfolio.
?Nobody does.
?Yeah.
I can't go on this journey
into oblivion.
I'm out.
I'm sorry
to hear that, Kevin.
Every entrepreneur has crises ??
every single one of them.
Some own up to it,
some don't.
It's what you do now
that really is gonna
define your business.
Normally, there is
a path somewhere.
You just have to find it.
Yours is gonna be difficult,
and what I've found
in those situations
is that I go
to my biggest customer,
and I'm brutally honest,
and just lay it all on the table
like you did for us,
and try to find a way
to work with them and say,
"Look, I've got
all this inventory.
Work with me."
And really discount it to cost
if you have
to to move out
of your inventory.
Learn your lessons,
use whatever cash that
you create from that,
and then start moving forward
as a smarter person
and smarter about
your industry.
But?
It's ?? It's not
a fit for me,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
?All right.
?Wish you the best.
?Thank you very much.
?Yes. Good luck.
?Thanks for your time.
?Thank you.
