Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jim Otteson,
and I am
a recovering addict.
For years, I was addicted
to diet soda,
and it would be nothing
for me to drink
12 or more cans in a day.
Wow.
I knew I had
to turn my life around,
and that's why
I invented Luma.
I am from beautiful
Palo Alto, California,
and I'm here
seeking $500,000
in exchange for 20% of
my company, Luma Soda.
?Kevin.
?Thank you, Jim.
O'Leary: Okay, let's all
try them together.
?Which one first?
?Let's go with the Cherry ??
?Should we all start Cherry?
?Cherry Cola. Cherry Cola.
Oza: Kevin, which one
are we doing first?
?Cherry Cola.
?Cherry.
?iY Chihuahua! iCaramba!
?It's delicious.
?Yeah.
?It's different.
?It tastes so sweet.
?I don't like it.
It's kind of juicy,
but it's not juice,
and it's kind of soda?y,
but it's not soda.
Okay, let's try
the Blood Orange.
?That's pretty good.
?Damn. That's good.
?Let's try the Lime now.
?The Lime.
?Oh, no!
?Odd.
Bet you don't
sell a lot of that.
O'Leary: Now, Cola's got to be
a big seller, right?
[ Burps ]
?Don't burp!
?It's a big seller, although,
we found that, uh, different
people have different favorites.
?Okay, that's a little funky.
?They're not buying the Cola.
Cola's no bueno.
Before you were
the soda king, who were you?
[ Chuckles ]
I was a trial lawyer
for 25 years.
?Of course you were.
[ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
?Yes.
I can tell by the pointer.
?Why? What ?? What type ??
?I love the pointer.
What type of trial law?
So, I litigated patent
infringement cases.
During that time,
I became addicted to diet soda.
I'd go through
the drive?through,
get a Super Big Gulp
something,
first thing in the morning
every day...
I did the same thing.
...and I would fill it
two at a time
with ice all day long.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?The thing about, uh, diet soda
is the aspartame
actually makes
your blood sugar fluctuate.
Correct.
So, what are your sales
with this?
Have you been selling this?
?Yeah.
Otteson: This year, so far
we've sold $180,000.
?Where are you selling?
?And where did you sell that?
We've sold directly
to consumers online.
How many
are repeat customers?
So ?? So, online, uh,
our repeat customers
aren't very high.
What we get is a ??
?Not good.
Yeah.
I?It's about 10%.
But ?? But what we get
is a lot of comments
from customers saying,
"Hey, I love this.
When are you gonna
be in my area
so that I don't have
to buy it online?"
Oza: What's your price point
online?
Right now, we are selling
12?packs online for $19.99.
Jim, how much have you
invested in this,
and have you raised
any outside money?
I haven't raised
any outside money in this,
and I have put a huge amount
of my own money.
?How much?
?How much?
?$1.75 million.
?[ Gasps ]
?Oh!
?Yow?za!
?Ow!
?Wow.
Boom goes the dynamite.
That's a lot of monk fruit.
Greiner: Oh, no!
That's a lot of
monk fruit.
Oza: You ??
Okay, hold on a second.
We got to back up
on this.
I'd get product development.
It's not cheap.
But you probably
make this
for a couple hundred
thousand dollars,
Then you've
been selling online...
You've been spending your money
on marketing, basically.
...with basically
15 grand a month.
I've been spending a lot
of my money on marketing.
How much do you have left
of the $1.75 million?
We don't have
very much left.
What we have is basically
$600,000 worth of inventory,
and, uh, about
$30,000 in the bank.
Why would you build up
half a million dollars
of inventory
when you're doing
$15,000 a month?
Unfortunately, I went through
a series of salespeople
who promised that we were gonna
be in retail distribution...
?That never happens.
?...and they failed miserably.
That's right.
They failed miserably.
So, they made you do
a big run of production ??
That's right.
To get nice, pretty,
printed cans like we have,
the minimum order for a SKU
is one truckload...
Which is how many cans?
...which is 204,225 cans
per SKU.
Where did that money
come from?
That's a hell
of a lot of cash.
So, that money came
from a combination
of a home equity
line of credit.
I also borrowed against
whole life insurance.
?Wow.
?Oh. Oh.
?A?? But ??
?Jimmy.
It's ?? It's not ?? It's not
a debt on the company's ledger.
That's commitment.
You're ?? You're all in.
That's debt that
I don't have to pay back.
Corcoran:
But you have all your chips
on the table here, don't you?
I have all of my chips
on the table.
Hey, Rohan, what is the path
that Jim can save Luma
from certain death?
Oza: Well, first of all,
he's got
a half a million dollars
of inventory
that he has to move
in a concentrated area
with traditional retail.
Yes.
Pick your X number
of retailers
across the state
of California,
'cause that's
where you're based,
and move
that inventory first.
So, we're in negotiations
with three large retailers,
and we expect to have
purchase orders this month.
Now I've got somebody ??
I've got a sales rep
who has a personal
relationship...
You're back with the sales reps?
...with a couple
of these buy??
Well [stammers] this guy
I'm not paying,
except on
a contingency.
Why didn't you do that in the
first place with all of them?
?Well, but he didn't.
?Well, you live and you learn.
We all go through that.
?Live and learn.
You know, I made
a lot of mistakes
in this business, Kevin...
?You don't say?
...and I did them
on my dime, okay?
Good for you.
I respect that
you owned up to it, Jim.
Well, the most valuable
lessons are the ones...
where you make the mistakes
and then you really learn
and you never do it again.
?Right.
I'm the person that drinks
all the flavored waters.
I try to stay away
from the sugar, right?
I did not
like the flavors.
But I've got good news
and bad news.
I'm gonna give you
the good news.
There's four
other Sharks.
?That's the good news?
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh, Lord.
?Good Lord, Lori.
The bad news is
I'm going out.
Look, honest,
the flavor standpoint,
I thought two of them
were terrific.
The Blood Orange and
the Cherry Cola were great.
Cola is a ??
It is the most difficult
category to penetrate.
It's why nobody
in flavored waters
tries to tackle cola.
If you could replicate cola
in this, I'm in.
?Right.
?I mean, you are dead?on.
Reduce the sugar, give me
a healthier ingredient,
make it taste great.
Two out of the four
taste great.
Here's my problem.
To pull out
a Mr. Wonderful line,
I can pretty much
go do this myself.
Yeah, but, Rohan ??
And so ??
Rohan,
slow down there.
First of all, you have
a totally dedicated guy here.
Number one, you don't get
this kind of guy very often.
Secondly,
you can fix it.
Why wouldn't you
jump in here?
You know what went wrong
that he could improve it.
You like the two
out of four flavors.
Why don't you
help the guy fix it?
?Moreover ??
?You're the only guy here
who really knows what
he's doing on this.
?Right, so ??
?Thank you, Barbara. Moreover ??
Barbara's great at that,
and I?I respect that.
If Barbara wants to jump in,
she's all welcome.
No, no, I ??
I'll tell you what,
I will give you an offer.
I'll give you half ??
$250,000 ??
which I was hoping
he was gonna jump in.
But only if Rohan's in.
for Jim's low?sugar soda
alternative Luma
if Rohan,
a beverage expert,
is willing
to partner with her.
I'll give you half ??
$250,000 ??
which I was hoping
he was gonna jump in.
But only
if Rohan's in.
You know, b?basically what
Barbara just said to you, Jim,
is you need
adult supervision.
?No, I didn't say that.
?That's not what she said.
?That's not what she said.
?That's what she said.
Otteson: Getting an investment
from a Shark
would have made all
the difference in the world
for our company,
so it's gonna be
an uphill battle,
but we're gonna ??
we're gonna keep fighting.
