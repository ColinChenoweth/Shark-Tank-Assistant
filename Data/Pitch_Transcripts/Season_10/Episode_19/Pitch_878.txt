ignited America's
entrepreneurial spirit,
and we're still
blazing a trail
for those who take their fate
into their own hands.
And tonight, branding expert
Rohan Oza returns to the Tank.
Coming on to "Shark Tank"
is not a business plan.
You need to come on
to "Shark Tank"
with a business plan.
...because there's a royalty
in there somewhere.
?I said $100,000.
?Okay.
And I said $0, because I think
it's a great marketing ploy
for him to soak his socks
in that stupid wine he sells
and get a lot of social?media coverage.
Are you ready for
the correct answer, please?
Yeah.
Please, Pricetitute.
?$792,000.
?There we go!
[ Greiner laughs ]
?I'm closest!
?You're the winner.
?Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
?I value foot health.
[ Laughter ]
a Shark that
knows royalties
to negotiate
that for you.
Do you know anyone that ??
that knows that sort of thing?
Cuban: No, he doesn't.
?That's his problem.
?I do, actually.
What does
it cost to make,
and what are you
selling it for?
$3.09 landed, and
I'm selling it for $21.99.
?Do we have the package?
?Can we see the packaging?
?Absolutely. Yeah, yeah.
?Where is it?
?Let's look at it.
?Oh, yeah.
Oza:
And so you sold it...
Greiner: Oh, how cute.
two months of last year,
is that right?
Oh,
I should help them out.
Oh, oh.
You got it.
Oh, I'm sorry. I got it.
?Here you go.
?That's so cute.
So, obv?obviously the shape ??
the shape here
is the price?tag shape,
so everything ties into that.
?I like the packaging.
?Thank you.
Greiner: It looks like
a little mailbox.
The packaging's very cool.
Hi. My name's Eric Roy,
and I'm a PhD chemist
from Washington, D. C.
My company is Hydroviv,
and I'm here
seeking $400,000
in exchange
for a 10% stake.
Sharks, have you ever
traveled to a different city
and noticed that
the water tastes different
than what you're used to?
That's because the water's
chemistry is different.
Now, of course, the real issue
with drinking water
isn't taste.
It's that tens of millions
of U. S. households
have contaminants
in their water
that exceed
Public Health Goal.
This is crazy.
Now, knowing
that different cities
have different problems
with their water,
why do water?filter companies
mass produce
one?size?fits?all systems?
It doesn't take
a PhD chemist
to realize that this isn't
the best approach.
Now, at Hydroviv, we take
a completely different approach.
We build
custom water filters
that are optimized
for each customer's water.
Here's how it works.
When you place an order
for a Hydroviv system,
our "Water Nerds" dig through
water quality data
for your area,
then build a filter that's
actually matched to your water.
So if you live in an area
that's susceptible
to lead contamination,
we add more
lead?removal media.
Or if you live in an area
that has high levels of arsenic,
we adjust
the filter's formulation
to stop the chemical
in its tracks.
So, whether you live in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
or Reno, Nevada,
we've got you covered.
Once the system's built,
we ship it to your home,
and you're able to hook it up
under your sink
to your existing faucet.
Sharks, I've seen
how poor water quality
can cripple a community,
and at Hydroviv, we can actually
do something about it.
So, who wants to be
the next Water Nerd?
?All right.
?Interesting.
Do we get samples?
?First question I have, though.
There was and still is
a clear water crisis
in the state of Michigan
in many areas.
Yes, sir.
Do you have a filter
that solves for that?
So, we actually
got our start...
Oh, that's heavy.
...in response to
the Flint lead disaster.
The existing water filters
on the market
weren't designed
to handle that.
So, you know,
I was developing technology
for Department of Defense
at the time.
I set up in my studio apartment
in Washington, D. C.,
and just started building
high?capacity
lead?removal filters
and donating them to people
and child?centric
organizations in Flint.
Wow.
?Wow.
?How much is the filter?
Average sales price
is right around $190.
It costs us $48 to make, build,
and ship it to the customer.
?We have free shipping.
?How long does the filter last?
Six months.
So, I want to buy
two filters, don't I?
Well, you want to buy
your up?front system,
and then you want
to subscribe.
The cartridge itself
costs us about $10 total.
And then every six months, how
much does it cost me to buy it?
$55.25.
What does this year look like?
Let's look at the numbers.
So, we'll do
just over $325,000.
?$325,000?
?Yes, sir.
We're gonna
do $1.7 million next year.
Oza: Where are you
currently selling it?
Retailers? Online?
100% e?commerce
through our website.
100% e?commerce
on your own website.
Greiner: Okay, what stood out
to me is that
you said you take out
arsenic, lead.
So let's take just
an easy, simple,
inexpensive thing
like a Brita, right?
Mm?hmm.
You fill it up
with water.
Does that take out
any of those things?
No.
I mean, there are others
that will remove lead.
There's others that
will remove arsenic.
The problem is
when you mass produce
that single formulation,
there's only so much space
in these cartridges, right?
So if you're ?? If you're trying
to do everything all at once,
you don't really
do anything very well.
Whereas what we're doing is
we're actually looking at
what that is in your water
and then blending
the filter cartridge ??
How many people have,
though, lead, arsenic ??
A lot.
Is there anything proprietary
about your filters?
Is it patented
in any way?
So, we have a nonprovisional
utility patent.
So, it's multiple claims.
One is the method
to rapidly,
um, assess and build
custom cartridges.
Another is the actual
construction of that cartridge.
The question for me is,
how do you plan on
creating the awareness of
the fact there's a problem?
Because at the moment,
in America at least,
I don't feel people
think there's a problem.
We're gonna
start advertising.
So, you haven't
been advertising at all?
We just ??
We just started,
like, market?research style.
Most of our inbound
traffic ??
We get over 2,000 visitors
a day to our blog,
organic, and we are
converting that traffic.
Just last week, we signed on
a marketing firm
for Facebook ads.
We're starting to test those.
So, you're gonna spend
a lot of money advertising.
Yes, ma'am.
I need help ??
sales and marketing.
Take the $400,000
that you're getting.
Yes, sir. Yep.
How are you deploying that
in a quick nutshell?
'Cause that will help me
understand where this ??
Senior?level
marketing person,
e?commerce experience,
ad operations ??
We need to start
to hire people like ??
?Oh, now you're losing ground.
?Like ??
Now you're
losing ground, right?
What's a senior?level
marketing person gonna do...
Right.
...that you're not
doing already?
?That's what I don't get.
?Well, because right now,
we're relying on agencies.
We outsource all of
our ad operations to agencies.
A management?level
marketing person
is just gonna want
to spend money
in new ways
to prove their value.
?Okay.
?Right?
?And charge you a lot of money.
?Where you already know ??
Whereas you already know
what's working.
You just need
to scale it, right?
Right now, we don't have
anyone at our company
who wakes up thinking about
the marketing analytics,
what the data are.
How about you?
You do. You do.
That's your job.
You're the head.
Eric, what I'm struggling
with is two things.
One, I don't think
the consumers realize
that they have a need.
And then I haven't seen
a simple way
to reach an audience.
And so, I don't see
how I can help you get that.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Okay, Eric. Now it's time
to make a decision.
Right? You know I'm not
the patient type.
O'Leary: Well,
I'll give you, Mark ??
I'll give you a little
something to think about.
I don't care what he says.
Right? Eric, what do you
want to do?
?Well, let me make it ??
?You haven't heard from Kevin.
Well, let me make it
a little clearer.
Mark may go out
by the looks of it.
There's a couple things ??
I do want to speak to Barbara.
?But I'm out.
?No, no, no. No, I'm sorry.
?Speak to Moneybags over here.
?No, no. To the point of not ??
Greiner: But Kevin
is still sitting here.
Cuban:
Eric, Eric. Don't talk yourself
out of an opportunity.
Eric, Kevin's gonna
make you an offer.
What do you
want to do, Eric?
Mark, you're who I came here
to get a deal with.
?Thank you.
?Before I accept that offer,
I do want to just
speak to the customer base.
Um, the way that ??
?Why would you mess with this?
?Let me do it, then.
Eric, do that ??
We'll discuss that
after you accept the offer.
Thanks, Eric.
Congratulations.
?Congrats.
?Thank you, Sharks.
?Great job, buddy.
?Good luck, Eric.
?Nice job.
?Thank you.
Just speaking
to the customer ??
?Of course!
?You got to go.
Swivel around.
You got to go, buddy.
You got the deal.
You got the deal.
O'Leary: Don't blow it.
Ohh, that's hilarious.
All I wanted to say to Mark
is that we're listening
to our customers.
Now that we have him
on our team,
it's ?? I'm just speechless.
Greiner: Yeah, he did not like
your comment, Barbara.
[ Laughs ] He wanted
to defend himself.
Oza: But wait ??
there's more!
?He wanted to defend himself.
?Take the offer and run.
