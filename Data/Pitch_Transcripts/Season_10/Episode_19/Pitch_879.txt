Epstein: I know
what you're thinking.
"He looks like Kevin,
only skinnier."
?Oh!
?Whoa!
I'm Steve Epstein
from Tenafly, New Jersey,
and I know
what you're thinking.
"He looks like Kevin,
only skinnier."
?Whoa!
?[ Laughs ]
I'm here seeking $500,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
Sharks,
there's a big problem,
and I've literally gotten
to the bottom of it.
Every day in every country
around the world,
men and women of all ages
are wasting their time
and creating pollution
simply because they can't get to
the bottom of their bottles.
[ Bottle thuds ]
We've all been there ??
the pump quits on our favorite
hair product or lotion...
[ Bottle clatters ]
...condiments, syrup,
sauce, car wax, glue,
or any other thick liquid
gets so low
that every time
we go to use it,
we have to start shaking
and pounding
to get that
last bit out.
At some point,
we just quit.
But those days are over.
I introduce to you
the Flip?It! Cap,
an ingenious
bottle?emptying device.
Simply attach
a Flip?It! Cap
to any standard screw?top bottle
and turn it upside down.
Gravity does the work
so you don't have to.
Then all you do is pull
the valve, squeeze.
So, Sharks,
who would like to join me
to take a big bite
out of waste,
improve people's lives,
and profitably do something
great for the planet?
I've got some samples
that I'd like to hand out.
?Yeah, let's try it.
?Bring 'em out.
Rohan, this is
our bath?inspired package.
Oh, yeah. Thank you. I always
do need it for the bath ones.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Lori, this is our
beauty?inspired package.
?Thank you.
?Is there a universal size?
'Cause all the s?? The apertures
seem to be different.
Yes.
So, uh, bottle threads,
with few exceptions,
are standard
around the world.
Mini?Me,
I have a few questions.
[ Laughter ]
All right.
Lots of
condiment manufactures,
they've already
designed the bottle
with a very large flat cap
so it can be turned over
and stored in
the fridge that way.
So, those bottles
are typically smaller
and more expensive
per ounce,
and they use
a lot more plastic
than the traditional bottle
that's filled from the top.
Greiner: Wait, wait.
What do you mean by that?
I didn't understand
your answer.
'Cause, I mean,
it's cap.
This would actually
be bigger than that.
Those flat caps that you see
on ketchup and things
by weight are tremendously
heavier than the Flip?It! Cap,
which goes
from bottle to bottle.
You'll wash this out
and reuse it
over and over again.
Reusable, you're saying,
versus a cap.
Totally.
What is your background?
Is this all that you do?
?Is this your everyday job?
?No. It's not.
I run a contract
packaging company,
and that's how I know
so much about bottle threads.
You've brought this
to the market, obviously,
and what has the market said?
What are the sales like?
The market has been
very receptive.
We've done $2.5 million
in sales.
?This year?
?In how long a period of time?
Uh, no. In, uh,
just over four years.
?Oh.
?How about this year?
Okay, give me ?? Could you
give me year?by?year, please?
The first year we started
with half a year.
It was about $177,000.
?Okay.
The next year
it was about $650,000.
?Okay.
?The following year,
we went up to $740,000.
Last year, it was $655,000.
?Oh.
?Mini?Me, you dropped in sales.
You went flat.
Well, I?I was having
a little bit too much
customer concentration
at QVC.
This is a product that's
already been through
the wringer on QVC?
Oh, yeah, 65 times.
?Oh!
?Wow.
?And now are you off?
?Lori, is that good or bad?
We're not off.
We're just taking a break.
I've switched over to HSN
to expose a different,
you know, population.
Well, that's what happens when
your sales start to slow,
which is nothing
to be ashamed of.
Every product
has a cycle.
Sorry, the last year ??
Does the last year ??
Last year was $655,000.
This year?to?date,
we're at $305,000.
?Oh.
?Whoa.
?How much does it cost?
?That's a $5.99 item.
?And what are your margins?
?Costs me 96 cents landed ??
We sell it on
our own website at $6.
?Are you profitable, Steve?
?I have been profitable.
I've taken money
out of the company,
but now I'm putting
money back in.
What are you gonna
use the money for?
The money is
gonna be used to build
additional,
higher?cavitation molds
so I can place
larger orders
to bring
my price down.
Costs of goods
is not the problem.
It's revenue, declining revenue.
?It's your revenue.
I still don't get
how you're gonna use
the $500,000
to drive revenue.
Part of it
is that last year,
we attended a conference
of merchants and distributors.
Steve, this thing is...
? Whaa?whaa?
whaa?whaa?a ?
I'm out.
Epstein:
I'm surprised, Kevin,
because you love a product that
appeals to a broad audience.
This is men and women,
regardless of age, language,
culture, religion ??
You asked for $500,000.
Right.
Your product's
in decline.
What could you possibly
use $500,000 for
that's gonna
turn it around?
?Right. So now ??
?Steve, it doesn't add up.
?What I need to do now, Mark ??
?I'm out.
Okay.
Why is it nobody's
biting at this product?
Everybody's trying
to play catch up to Amazon.
They've been gut punched
a couple times.
?They don't know ??
?Worst excuse ever.
?Well...
?But ?? But ?? Hold on.
Every retailer
I deal with
has been gut punched
by Amazon...
Right.
...yet I get distribution
on my products every day.
Steve, how much
do you have in inventory?
I'm just curious.
?At wholesale, $500,000.
?Wow.
?Oh!
?$500,000 in inventory?
?You have $500,000?
So, you have $500,000
worth of inventory.
Right.
The worst time to go
to investors for money
is when your company's
going south.
Right.
It's a disaster.
Unfortunately,
the entrepreneur
doesn't have a lot of control
of when and if he gets to appear
on "Shark Tank."
But coming on to "Shark Tank"
is not a business plan.
You need to come
on to "Shark Tank"
with a business plan.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
So, the problem for me is,
is it's almost like it just
became outmoded too fast,
because it's on
pretty much everything
in a grocery store
already.
So it's on the ketchups,
the mayos, and all of that.
And, unfortunately,
for those reasons, I'm out.
Okay.
The 53 buyers you were
hoping to call you back,
they ain't
ever gonna buy it.
But because
you had your success
by demonstrating the product
in that medium,
why would you not
make your own infomercial
or at least
a video online
that demonstrates
the product?
People are not watching
television the way they used to.
They're DVR?ing,
they're skipping commercials.
Well, you know ?? you know what?
That sounds exactly
like your other excuse
that the stores aren't
buying because of Amazon.
?Okay.
?But here's the problem.
You're trying to make
this thing go
when you've already lost
your interest in it.
You said it was
a side business.
I'm spending about
half my time on it.
Worse than that,
a quarter of your heart.
It's almost like you're here
announcing what used to be,
and you want us to put in
fresh money for tomorrow.
I'm out.
Look, there's always that
classic scene in a movie ??
Grandma's maybe 105,
she's on the bed,
she's looking at her family,
they've all loved her...
?[ Laughs ]
?...they're having that moment.
They've had a great life
together, and she says,
"Pull the cord.
I'm ready."
[ Laughter ]
You got
to pull the cord.
?Thank you all.
?Bye?bye.
Greiner: Good luck.
Epstein:
We've got a lot of interest,
and this thing is gonna explode
like throwing a Ping?Pong ball
into a room full of mousetraps.
And, um, they'll see.
I'll do it without them
just fine.
