My name is Keisha Jeremie,
and my company
is Sanaía Applesauce.
I'm asking for $150,000
for 15% in my company.
Now, Sharks,
have you ever noticed that
the entire applesauce industry
has been completely ignoring us?
They're focused on 8?year?olds
and they're focused
on 80?year?olds,
and they're leaving
a ton of money on the table.
'Cause think about it ??
if you're an adult
and you're looking for
applesauce on shelves,
the options are really slim.
Basically, they've been
asking us to settle
for baby food
all these years ??
baby food flavors,
baby food consistency,
and now pouches.
Sharks, I am a grown woman.
I am not doing pouches.
And so I've finally decided to
take matters into my own hands.
Introducing Sanaía.
I've taken organic green apples
and curated six
island?inspired flavors.
I've also done something else
that no one else
has thought of ??
in every jar,
you'll find baked apple wedges.
Oh.
Thanks, Keisha.
Appreciate it.
Keisha, how do you sell it,
and what is the cost?
The glass jar is gonna be
our product on Amazon Prime.
It's going to be sold
as a four?pack of flavors.
The glass jar is $1.03
and $3.99 per jar to retail.
Right, so $3.99 times four,
so, effectively, $16 at retail.
That's right.
And your cost is $4.12.
That's right.
Is that not expensive
for applesauce?
So, again, you know, we're not
comparing ourselves to Mott's.
As I mentioned
in the opening,
this is essentially what
Chobani did with yogurt, right?
They took a category
that was pretty sleepy
and they elevated
the flavors,
they elevated the positioning,
they elevated the packaging.
We just spent
the last 48 hours
at the IDDBA conference ??
or trade show ??
and we came back
with close to $35 million
in projected revenue,
based on interest.
Oh, please.
I'm not buying it, Keisha.
?I'll tell you ??
?Wait, wait.
?Yeah, tell us how.
?Explain who said what.
?Hang on a second.
?I'll tell you. I'll tell you.
Corcoran: Give her a chance.
Give her a chance.
I'll tell you.
So, Starbucks, Whole Foods,
Sam's Club, BJ's, Kroger's,
literally buyers sending
other buyers to us.
They were referring to us
at the show ??
O'Leary: They're not
giving you orders, right?
Well, it's not
an order?taking conference.
But before the trade show,
we'd already had a commitment
with Whole Foods.
A test with Whole Foods?
Whole Foods in Harlem.
So one store?
One store.
What I heard
was "$35 million."
Yep.
So how did you get there?
Why do you say that?
So, if we look at ??
'Cause everything was
going great till I heard that.
So, what happened,
basically,
is we had a number of buyers
come to us ??
Did you get a firm order
from anybody?
We have not received
firm orders from them.
But they ?? what we received is
basically confirmed interest.
They came by,
they basically said,
"No one else is doing this.
This immediately belongs
in our refrigerated section."
Actually, I want to show you
the pictures of what they ??
Oh.
They're putting it
into a yogurt cup,
not a glass jar?
That's different.
That's different.
Could we see that?
Sure.
?Oh, so this is a new product.
?Oh.
So, this is the product that
we've been talking to grocers ??
?That's a better idea.
?That's a better idea.
Still the same flavors.
Keisha,
what's your background?
I'm currently global head of HR
for one of
the largest publishing companies
in the country.
?Well, that's related.
?Which one?
News Corp.
News Corporation.
Oh, very impressive.
So, I've been there
for six years.
And you pull this off
on the side?
And I've been doing it ??
But I also, uh ??
I've been building
high?performance teams
for 20 years,
and so I immediately knew
that I needed to build a team
to do this.
So, you're not gonna go
full time into this?
Well, at this moment,
it doesn't make sense
for me to be full?time,
but I have a COO
who literally is minutes away
from our production plant,
and this is his full?time job.
So, did you raise
a lot of money, Keisha?
It sounds expensive.
I have been self?funding it
so far.
$250,000 is what I've spent
so far on it.
Wow.
It seems to me
like you got very far
for $250,000.
Cuban: Yeah.
This product
versus this product ??
what's your plan
for this?
The glass jars will be
on Amazon Prime in two weeks.
The glass jars in two weeks
on Amazon.
Why are you ?? the shipping cost
is gonna be enormous.
The weight of the glass is
the same as the liquid inside.
Well, we're able to make close
to 50% margins on the glass,
margins of 46%.
What will the cost of
this be, if this one ??
This is 63 cents to make.
?Oh.
?63 cents to make.
But to sell?
To sell
will be, um, $1...
$1.02 wholesale,
and then we're thinking $1.79.
This is the most expensive
applesauce ever sold in America.
I guess what I would
respond to in that is,
Herjavec: Keisha,
I have to tell you,
your presentation
was very impressive
until we got
to the trade show.
Okay.
When you confuse interest
with actual orders,
it leaves me
with doubt.
It's just not for me.
Okay.
I'm out.
Okay.
I respect that.
Thank you.
I happen to think both
of your products are great ??
for a lot of reasons.
I don't think your price
is out of line.
Your retail is 2 bucks.
That's about right, with
everything else on the shelf.
I thought
the flavor was phenomenal,
and the texture,
creamy and delicious ??
Are you gonna
make her an offer?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
The major point is,
you're definitely a dreamer,
but you can't justify
the dream,
and that's very disturbing.
I mean, the numbers
you throw out,
I can't believe each time
you give an explanation
how you're gonna
get there.
Okay.
But there are businesses where
it's worth taking a flyer on.
Yep.
You could be
the next big thing.
But the kind of offer
I'd have to make you,
I'm afraid I'd insult you.
Would <i>any</i> offer insult you
at this point?
I don't think any offer
would insult me.
I'm curious to see what you
think the valuation is.
I would give you the $150,000,
but I would have to get...
...at least 75%.
in Keisha's
gourmet applesauce, Sanaía,
but she wants a huge chunk
of her company.
I would give you
the $150,000,
but I would have to get
at least 75%.
By the way,
did that insult you?
Didn't insult me.
It was just interesting.
Okay.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Well said.
Would you like
to accept my offer?
No, that's not an offer
that we can take. Thank you.
I'm out.
We've been through this.
We've all looked
at food products.
I'm not saying you're wrong,
but I'm saying it's risky.
It really is risky.
And you're not full?time,
which, I got to tell you,
really bothers me.
If you really believe this,
you'd quit your job
and you'd be telling me that
you don't sleep on weekends.
I <i>don't</i> sleep on weekends.
[ Laughter ]
But I'm also
the breadwinner,
and it's not an option
for everyone.
No, I get it,
but, you know, it's ??
That's not an option for everyone, yeah.
Not everybody can do that.
But there's a difference.
I'm out.
How much cash do you have
in the bank?
So, I have set aside, uh,
close to $500,000
for the business,
'cause I'm self?funding it
right now.
So you've put in
$250,000 already,
and you have another $250,000
of your savings...
Correct.
Look, you have a presence
about you.
You know this.
You have a power about you.
What I haven't been convinced of
is that you're an entrepreneur.
I get you're a breadwinner.
You have those responsibilities.
That's always a push/pull
that people have.
But at the same time,
we <i>all</i> were broke.
I'm not convinced.
Here's what I can tell you.
I didn't <i>have</i> to
start the business.
If I did not see
the market opportunity,
I would not put
my life savings into it.
I do work
around the clock.
It is definitely not
a part?time gig
in the way
that you've described it.
Well, you do work
somewhere else.
I do work somewhere else,
but "part?time" sounds like
you're checking in
and checking out.
But I also think that because
it couldn't be my full?time job
right out of the gate,
I put a team in place.
That's great.
You're an owner.
From a risk profile,
why aren't you throwing
everything into this?
I cannot afford to.
Look, I think
that's so unfair.
Cry me a river. You think the world
is fair? The luxury of
leaving her job and doing it ??
She's not working
full time.
I started my first company,
I wanted to be all?in.
You know what?
I had a mortgage.
I had a child at home.
I didn't have that choice.
Keisha, why are you
tearing up? Tell me.
Is there like...
"De?de?de?de?de"?
Why are you tearing up?
Um...
We'll do this.
Congrats, Keisha!
?Congrats, Keisha.
?That felt so good!
Keisha, I'm gonna
make you focus on this.
?Yes, I got it.
?...over the glass, okay?
I heard that loud and clear.
Okay, we'll make it work.
