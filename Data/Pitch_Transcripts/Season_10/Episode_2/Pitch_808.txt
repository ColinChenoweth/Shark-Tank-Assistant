helped me be standing
in front of you all today.
We've grown up
on this show.
And remember, there's
only one Mr. Wonderful.
And thank God for that.
Narrator:
...and brand?new Sharks
jump into the Tank.
Former NBA superstar
and broadcaster Charles Barkley
is a prolific investor
and committed
to helping entrepreneurs.
You seem to be
on the right track,
and I'm willing
to take the chance.
Matt Higgins is vice chairman
of the Miami Dolphins
and is co?founder
of RSE Ventures,
which invests
in innovative companies
across multiple sectors,
including sports,
lifestyle, and technology.
When we work together,
it's gonna be "Game over."
And Jamie Siminoff,
the founder of Ring,
sold his company to Amazon
for over $1 billion
and is the first
"Shark Tank" entrepreneur
to return as a Shark.
"Shark Tank" has inspired
a nation to chase their dreams.
[ Motorcycle engine revs ]
Man: This has been
a lot of my life,
and I just want to share that
with people.
There is a tenacity that I have,
and nothing's gonna stop me.
What you've done
is just inspiring.
Narrator:
And the dream continues now.
Kevin, they say
you're wrong.
I'm never wrong!
I'm always right!
I will make you
a millionaire.
Riding all the way
to the bank, baby! Yeah!
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
?Oh, my gosh!
?We got a deal!
Welcome to "Shark Tank."
Look, I'm just an investor
trying to scratch out
a living here, okay?
It's not for permanent use.
It's not for days at a time.
It's for hours at a time,
car rides.
Oh. So you don't
leave your dog in the...
?Yeah, no. No, no.
?Oh.
Do you have a patent pending,
did you say?
We do, but we have
foregone that.
You let it go?
Like, the time came ??
you applied...
Yeah.
When I first did it,
the first utility patent was
done several years ago,
I didn't have the money.
I didn't have the funds.
O'Leary: So, you're not worried
if you build this business
and it gets traction,
maybe gets to $5 million,
basically, anybody can
knock you off, right?
That is the risk,
but ??
Yeah, I'd rather have
the problem of having
$5 million in sales
with 82% margins.
Yeah.
Herjavec: So, hang on.
$1.2 million this year.
Tell me what the next
two years look like.
What we want to get to next year
is $2.5 million in 2019 ??
But how are you
going to do it?
Give me a step?by?step...
Step?by?step process?
...so I appreciate how
you're really gonna get there.
I mean, number one
is wholesaling.
We would like to get into
the big box stores, so...
I hate to say this,
but with multiple SKUs, right,
across multiple colors, there's
an inordinate amount of risk.
On the other hand,
you get better at SEO
and particularly on Amazon,
and your margins are
80?plus percent, you know?
You could make more money
selling half as many units
with 1/3 as much cash.
Guys, I think it's
a great business for you.
I think what you've
accomplished is amazing.
I'm not a pet industry guy,
so I don't know
that I'm gonna help put
any accelerant on it.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it.
The first biggest lie
every retailer tells you ??
"You need a lot of SKUs.
We need more SKUs."
It has put more young
entrepreneurs out of business
than any other lie
in the industry.
True.
I would slow down.
You got something great here.
You've grabbed on
the end of it.
Why don't you keep doing
more of what's working
before you go off into
that never?never land
called "retail," all right?
As a business,
I just can't relate to it.
I'm out.
Thanks, Barbara.
Appreciate it.
Okay. Thank you.
Guys, I like it.
I think it's absolutely nuts.
I didn't believe it.
?It's a great idea.
?But now I get it.
Listen, I'll throw
something out here.
I'll give you ??
it's $250,000.
I'll do it for 33%.
Cuban: Ohh!
Okay, thank you
for the offer.
Hey, it's an offer.
We really appreciate
the offer, yeah.
And there's only one
Mr. Wonderful. Remember that.
?Yeah.
?Thank God for that.
True, true, true.
Okay, I really like it.
It reminds me very much
of Tipsy Elves, Sand Cloud ??
unique, a little bit kitschy,
but with a real application.
We've got lots
of inventory issues,
and we're all online
in those businesses.
So, I'll give you the $250,000
for the same 33%.
I'm a much better Shark
in this deal than Kevin.
Kevin hates animals.
I want you to know
that I actually speak dog.
Okay.
And so I know exactly
what that dog is thinking.
Greiner: Speak a little dog
for us, Kevin.
So you're just matching
my offer.
So, you're matching his.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So, I don't agree with
the thought
that you shouldn't be
in retail.
You have a really good,
strong online business.
I think you should also have
a TV?shopping presence,
because
this is demonstrable.
You need to show
why is this great,
as opposed to crazy,
right?
You need
to blitz the market,
because if you let go
of the patent and all of that,
you just really have to be
first and strong.
I'm gonna give you
$250,000,
but for 28%.
28%.
Okay.
Is there any way you'd
be willing to do 25%?
Um...
Tell me three things
about you...
Oh, Lord...
...that make you fantastic
as a partner.
Okay, I work nonstop.
I work every single day.
Two, when I put my mind to
something, I get it done.
Three, I feel like
I'm kind of funny,
so I might make you
laugh a little bit.
?There you go.
?There's a bonus.
?Aww!
?Bravo!
Maybe?
Do you know the word "no"?
Doesn't exist.
Deal!
Yes! Great!
All right!
We'll take it.
?Congrats, guys.
?Awesome.
All right.
I like it!
I'd give you a hug,
but I am all hairy, so..
Eww!
I'm clean.
My name is Nathan Day,
and I'm from Gilbert, Arizona.
My company is LugBug,
the most convenient way
to carry a child seat.
I'm seeking $300,000 in exchange
for 10% of my company.
I'm gonna need some help
to demo this.
Robert, you just had twins.
Why don't you come up here
and give me a hand.
I am an expert.
Come on, new dad.
Go get 'em.
Robert, pick up the dumbbell
in one hand for me.
[ Grunting ]
[ Laughter ]
All right.
Yeah.
Very strong.
Love it.
Now, hang it down
by your side
how'd you normally
carry the dumbbell.
Now, do you see how the weight
hangs naturally at his side,
with his palm facing in?
I want you to pick up
the car seat in your other hand.
Look how awkward
that is.
It's not a natural way
to carry weight,
nor is it good for your arm
or your shoulder.
In fact,
nearly half of all parents
experience shoulder,
back, and neck pain
due to lugging around
a baby carrier.
So I did something
about it.
I created LugBug,
the most convenient way
to carry a child seat.
Just clip LugBug
on your handle here.
And if you need to adjust it,
you simply press down, rotate,
and let it click into place.
Oh, wow.
But, you know, Robert,
to get the true feel of this,
I thought we might need
a little bit more help.
So come on out, guys!
?Aww!
?Ohh!
[ Laughter ]
Yes! [ Laughs ]
Ohhhh!
They're so teeny!
Aww!
O'Leary: Robert,
you're scaring that child.
?Oh, my God.
?Aww!
Guys, I'd like
to introduce you.
You guys all know Kymmy,
of course.
I'd like to introduce you
to Hudson.
[ Deep voice ]
Hi, Mark. Hi, Barbara.
?What's up, Hudson?
?Hey, Hudson.
[ Normal voice ] And this
beautiful child is Haven!
[ Coos ]
Oh. Shh.
Day:
So, let's try it out.
Okay.
Yeah.
It <i>is</i> easier.
'Cause you don't know if you
want to carry it like that or...
Correct.
...this way.
It's definitely better
on the wrists.
Does it add weight?
It does add weight.
It's currently 12.6 ounces.
Okay.
Just a little bit.
You don't really notice that.
Let me pass those out.
Herjavec: Yeah.
Here you go.
Any one?
Yep.
You can take the packaging, too,
if you like.
You're here!
Can I see one of
those boxes, as well?
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
?You're welcome.
Feels well?built.
Oh, wow. Okay.
Day: Well, thank you so much
for joining us.
?Yeah, thank you very much.
?I appreciate it.
I'll take the babies away.
?Bye!
?Bye!
Herjavec: Bye, Hudson!
Bye, Haven!
Day: Thank you.
Herjavec: All right,
what does it cost you, Nathan?
Did you ever tell us?
The product retails
for $39.99.
First thing I did was file for
a patentability letter.
It was just to see,
is this product out there?
Has it been done before?
?Did you get it?
I have four issued
in the U. S.
Greiner: Wow.
I have six pending.
?Four patents?
?Four patents.
?Utility or design?
Utility.
I have six pending worldwide.
Okay, this is great,
but do you have any sales?
I do have sales. I have
a cumulative $283,000 in sales.
I launched ??
I hate that.
Don't ever tell me
cumulative.
?For how many years?
?How long?
That's 2016, '17, and '18.
So, what were sales
last year?
$198,000 ?? all online.
And what does it cost you
to make a unit?
The handle itself,
manufactured overseas, is $4.31.
With packaging, duties,
and landed,
I'm at $5.92.
Get me excited about
the retailers you've talked to
that want to bring it in
and test it.
Do you have a Target
or Walmart
that wants to actually
put it in the store?
No.
Why not?
Target and Walmart would like
to try it out online.
How much
have you invested?
Okay, so, over the years,
with the patents,
I've put in $750,000.
?Whoa!
?What?!
?Unbelievable.
Where did you get
the $750,000, Nathan?
Um, it's personal ??
uh, personal capital.
Yes, it <i>is</i> personal,
isn't it?
Greiner: Yeah, what did
all that money go into?
So, tooling, manufacturing,
patents.
Cuban: Look, Nathan,
I think it's a good idea,
but your challenge is,
you haven't quite figured out
the way to market it
in a way that people understand.
It kind of says
what it is,
but it really has to
be demonstrated.
I don't know that you have
an immediate answer for that.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay, Robert, are you
buying two of these?
No.
I'll tell you why
I'm not buying the product,
and I'll demonstrate something
for you, Nathan.
I went to the doctor with
the twins the first time...
Okay.
...and I was swinging the babies
around and doing it all badly.
And the doctor
looked at me and said,
"You haven't done this
for a while, have you?"
He goes, "Let me show you
an easier way to do it.
Just do that. Just carry it
around like this."
Oh, that's better.
You could do this
a lot longer
a lot longer than
you could do the twist.
I'll tell you,
you're a great salesman,
but let me tell you what is
of great concern to me.
It's your judgment.
The idea that
you could spend $750,000
developing this product
is mind?boggling to me.
You went and got all these
patents before you had sales.
What good are the patents
if you don't have the sales?
As much as I like you,
I'm out.
Look, does anybody
really want this product?
The patents intrigue me.
The revenues don't.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Nathan, first of all,
I loved your super?hot model
and the two babies.
?[ Laughs ]
Love that.
I admire how
you got to market.
I completely disagree
with Kevin.
If you can get $200,000
in sales in two years
on a $30 product,
that's a lot of volume units,
so I applaud you for that.
?Thank you.
?But still, you won't buy it?
Well, I accept
people are buying it,
but I'm carrying around
baby seats all the time.
I don't carry them
long enough
where I would think
I would need this.
If I'm not gonna
buy the product,
I can't buy the company.
I'm out.
Now, it's all you, Lori.
What are you gonna do?
O'Leary: Don't give him the
kumbaya, "You keep going" thing.
I'm not giving him
the kumbaya.
Tell him the truth.
He needs the truth.
No, no, listen.
It's a smart concept.
Your only play
is to take this
to a baby seat carrier
and license it.
Help me get there.
I don't really think
that you need
my help to do that.
I'm out.
?Good luck to you.
?Nathan, thank you.
?Good luck.
?Good luck.
Day: I believe in LugBug,
and I'm gonna continue
believing in LugBug.
Robert said
he wasn't gonna buy it,
but when his kids
are 6 months old,
he's gonna be coming back.
Kevin O'Leary helped us
grow Lovepop 100x
in the last three years.
Together, we've created
7 million magical moments.
All: Thank you, "Shark Tank"!
One hot summer day, I was
getting ready to go on a date,
and I could not stop sweating.
Fresh out of the shower,
I grabbed my T?shirt
and I put it on and I tucked it
underneath my girls,
but that just made me
even hotter.
The struggle is real.
So I came up with
a solution of my own ??
the Ta?Ta Towel.
That's right ??
it's a towel for yo' ta?tas.
?Whoa!
?Wow!
?Oh, my goodness!
?Uh...
Daymond's gonna be so upset
he's not here.
The Ta?Ta Towel
is terry cloth on one side
and a super?soft liner on the
other, making it reversible.
It's like your girls
are on vacation,
lounging in hammocks somewhere.
And who doesn't love
a good vacation?
So, Sharks, who wants to join me
in the boobie business
and get your hands
on my Ta?Ta Towels?
[ Laughs ]
So, they walk around
outside like that?
I came up with it just for
getting out of the shower,
and I just figured
for around the house.
However, I have had some
amazing customers and women
So, you cinch it tighter
from the neck?
Yes.
And also tighten it
underneath?
Absolutely. And you can wiggle,
move, dance around,
and your girls will stay ??
?Can you bend forward?
?Absolutely.
How endowed do the girls
have to be?
The smallest size
is a small ?? or a big C.
The biggest size
it goes up to is an H.
Wow.
?Let me pass these out first.
?All right.
This is for you.
Thank you.
I could try this
on Kevin's head, though.
It's about the same.
?Kevin, this is for you.
We thought you might want
to feel how it really feels.
There you go.
[ Laughter ]
I really don't need
one of these at all.
But you know what ??
they make great gifts.
I could see this working.
Oh, there you ?? Pfft.
Yeah, see? There you go.
It looks really good on you.
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh, my God.
Did you put a patent
on these little puppies?
Yes, sir. I have a patent
and a trademark
registered here
and in China.
Is it a design patent
or utility?
It is a design patent
for the original,
which you have,
and then the second towel
that you have
is my second patent pending,
for maternity.
Herjavec:
What does it sell for?
The originals sell for $45, and
the maternities sell for $55.
And what does it cost you
to make?
$24.
?Oh, that's high.
?How many have you sold?
12 months,
I've sold $1.1 million.
?Whoa!
?Whoa.
?Wow.
?You're kidding!
?It costs you $24 ??
?Congratulations!
Thank you for saying that.
So, you're selling them
all online, right?
I sell them only exclusively
from my website.
Cuban: You've got to be
just crushing it,
rolling in the dough
right now.
It's been life?changing.
Right before this happened,
I'd been a personal assistant
for 13 years.
Hated my life.
It was a really difficult job.
So I quit,
and I was making all of these
in my living room.
I YouTubed how to sew.
I couldn't even thread
the needle or, like,
get it in there,
and I started
making them myself.
?You're amazing.
?But then ??
?Wow!
?Thank you.
When I first came up with this,
I started handing them out.
And then, out of nowhere,
I don't know who got their hands
on these towels,
but all of a sudden, whenever
I get a sale on my phone,
something would just
drop down, right?
Like, ding, sale.
Ding, sale.
And all of a sudden, I just see
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, and
I thought my phone was broken.
Like Las Vegas.
So, my neighbor runs out
and she's like,
"Have you been online?
You are everywhere!"
Oh, so it just ??
it went viral on its own?
On its own.
Do you manufacture
here still?
I am proud to say
I manufacture in Los Angeles.
They are handmade <i>by</i> women,
<i>for</i> women,
in an eco?friendly
manufacturer.
Good for you.
O'Leary: Do you think
you could increase the price
because it's domestically
made by hand?
Yeah, 'cause your margins
are low, honestly.
What set me back
in the beginning
is I went viral, right,
and I did not know
what I was doing.
Everyone took advantage of that
and jumped on
and tried to rip me off
and steal.
So I had to take a break.
Did you enforce
your patents?
So, we enforced my patent.
What are you gonna sell
this year?
We're on track
to sell $2 million.
And what are your sales
year?to?date?
$188,000.
For the year?
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.
You're gonna go from $180,000
in the first six months
to $2 million for
the rest of the year?
Absolutely. We have so many
people from all over the world.
Like I said,
I had to close down ??
How are you
gonna do that?
I'm still trying to
get my head around
going from $180,000, six months,
to $2 million.
Well, the reason is
is that ??
First of all,
the towels really work.
O'Leary:
But that's not the problem.
We all assume it works.
You have to make it to get
the $2 million in sales,
and you've only got
six months.
Yeah, oh, I have
inventory on hand.
?How much?
?How much?
I have 10,000 units on hand.
Do you have $2 million
worth of inventory right now?
Oh, no, no,
not $2 million.
Here's the problem.
A lot of things aren't
adding up right now.
You had this viral moment.
That propelled sales
in a short period of time
to $1 million.
Yes.
You come into this year,
and you don't have
the viral moment
and you have
all the aggravation
of shutting down
all the knock?offs.
But $250,000 in inventory
equals a half a million dollars
in sales.
Uh?huh.
So you got to be able
to turn your inventory
four times, basically ??
Well, isn't QVC great?
I mean, I'm ready for 'em.
I've got the product.
Have you talked to them?
No.
Wait, I don't think
there's any way in the world
that you're getting
to $2 million in sales
unless you have another one
of those viral moments.
Well, that's why I'm here,
honestly, is,
I'm not afraid to say that,
like, I have this inventory.
I don't know
what to do with it.
They <i>are</i> selling.
Sales are consistent.
But it's not just viral ??
it's also going global.
Like I said ??
?Forget about global.
You've got to show it working
in the U. S. market.
You're kind of
making my case, right,
because to think that
the world is your oyster
and if you only sell
the entire world,
then you're gonna get
$2 million,
it doesn't really
work that way.
You're just a little bit
too scattered for me.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Well, thank you.
I learned something today,
but I can??
What's it worth today,
Kevin?
It's not even worth
$200,000.
You haven't proven out
what you can do here.
It's worth $250,000.
She'll sell her inventory.
Today is Slyde Fest,
the second annual charity
handboard competition.
We've got riders in
from all over the world.
Oh, nice!
Angela:
When we went on "Shark Tank,"
Steve and I were engaged.
But we used the money my mom
had saved for our wedding
to grow the business.
Now we're able
to pay her back,
get married,
and have our new baby girl.
The year before "Shark Tank,"
we did $159,000 in sales.
It's been two years,
and we've done
over $1.3 million in sales.
?Ash.
?Hey!
?What up?
?How's it going?
Kutcher: The thing I liked
about Slyde,
they're actually
giving people a way that,
if they don't surf,
if they don't boogie board,
that they can get in the water
and do something fun,
and I think that that's amazing.
This grom handboard
is the key for us.
The board, pretty much
anybody can afford.
This is the game changer,
guys.
And we're really excited
to bring this
to Dick's Sporting Goods
this summer.
Cuban:
Through our team, we have a
great relationship with Dick's,
so we introduced them,
and they loved the product.
We were able to get them
distribution nationwide,
and that accessibility
is critical
for creating
what's effectively a new sport.
This deal is gonna go
incredibly well.
The only question is,
who's next?
Steve: I personally can't
believe how far it's come.
I get up every morning
and do what I love to do.
I get to work
with my beautiful wife.
It's an incredible
life to live ??
basically, all thanks
to "Shark Tank."
Today, you're meeting
the woman
who's about to take the entire
applesauce category by storm.
When the yogurt industry <i>finally</i>
started listening to adults
and gave them a snack
that they actually deserve,
that $8 billion category
turned into $125 billion.
So what I'm about to do
is take these green apples
and turn them into billions
of green dollars.
Who's coming with me?
So, I also have
some samples for you.
Hopefully, I've tempted you.
?Thank you. Yeah.
I love applesauce.
Thank you.
So, these are four
of our six flavors.
Thank you.
And are you
in the market today,
or is this brand?new?
So, this is ??
We just launched in July.
We did a test market for
six months, direct?to?consumer.
And what are
your sales today?
So, we achieved $40,000 of sales
in that six?month test pilot.
Are people buying it because
they like the flavor
or do you see it
as a health food?
Well, they're buying it
because a lot of people
are looking for
plant?based, right?
They're looking
to move away from dairy.
And it's vegan.
Vegans actually bake with
applesauce instead of eggs.
the person who buys Mott's today
is not really our consumer.
Cuban: So, here's
the problem I'm having.
I see where you're going.
Right?
Right.
Create a new category.
This is gonna be hard,
if not impossible, to sell
because you're not
an established brand.
Now, <i>this,</i> on the other hand,
if it's a grab?and?go,
Well, so, we ??
This is where we started.
Greiner: For me,
it's really super basic.
It's, how popular is
applesauce for adults?
I'm not really
an applesauce fan.
You know, after 10 seasons
sitting here,
going out on a person's dream
is never easy...
Mm?hmm.
...and it pains me
to sit here and say,
but I'm out.
That's fine.
I respect that.
Kumbaya!
So I had to work
24 hours a day.
She's not asking
for kumbaya.
Are you kidding?
She's just saying she has
a family to support.
Entrepreneurs come in here
every day,
they're full?time, 110%.
