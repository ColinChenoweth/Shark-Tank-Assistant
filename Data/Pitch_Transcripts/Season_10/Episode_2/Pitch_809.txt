and veterinarian?approved.
The Shed Defender allows you
more quality time with your pet
and less time
cleaning up after it.
So stop wearing
your dog's hair
and let the Shed Defender
wear it for you.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to throw us a bone?
?Oh, my God.
?I got to see.
?Come on up and see it.
?Come up and see it.
It's crazy.
I'm gonna pass out
some samples.
Hey!
We figured you'd love her.
Ohh!
We have two of the dog models
for you guys
to kind of
play around with.
Where's the zipper?
So, that is how it works.
Thank you.
So, you can see the zipper
down there at the bottom.
And then, Mark,
we got you blue...
Perfect.
...so it'll
match your, uh ??
Mavs colors.
Your Mavs.
Corcoran: How does your dog
feel about this?
She loves it.
So, you can actually do
a number 2 without a problem?
?Oh, yeah.
?Oh, yeah.
?It's wide open.
?It doesn't get on it?
Yeah, no, it's wide open,
so male, females,
it doesn't matter.
Why don't you walk us
through the numbers?
We've been selling
for about 18 months.
We've done $1.2 million
in sales.
?No!
?What?
?Good for you.
?What?!
Yeah, we've sol??
Are you serious?
25,000 units.
Yeah, in that 18 months,
we have sold 25,000 units.
Wait, wait.
Where did you sell that?
We sell on our site
and Amazon,
and we just started
wholesaling.
And how much does
each one sell for?
We have
nine different sizes.
The small one, the mini,
retails for $39.99,
and it goes up to
our giant size, $62.99.
And what does it
cost you to make?
Landing cost,
the mini is $6.23,
and it goes up to $13.20.
?Great. Wow!
?You're killing it.
We got about
an 80% profit margin.
You're making a boatload
of money.
We're starting to.
So, I started with just
the shedding aspect, right?
But after all
the customer feedback
after selling thousands
of these things,
another key benefit,
it reduces anxiety.
It keeps a dog calm.
Cuban: It's like
swaddling a child.
Yeah.
We have
a third benefit ??
it can replace
the medical cone, as well.
The cone of shame.
Does the dog not get hot?
It's lightweight,
breathable fabric.
And when I developed
the product,
that was the main thing
I had in mind.
Also, it's for
situational use.

Hi, Sharks.
My name's Erin Robertson.
I'm from Los Angeles,
California,
and I'm seeking $200,000
for 10% equity in my company.
I'm in the business
of keeping boobs high and dry.
[ Laughter ]
That's right ?? boob sweat.
I know it doesn't sound
very attractive,
and trust me, it does not
<i>feel</i> very attractive, either,
but it is something that's
very real for so many women.
Erin, the words
"I have all this inventory,
and I don't know
what to do with it"
is pretty scary
to an investor.
Never good. Yeah.
I shouldn't have said, "I don't
know what to do with it."
Well, I know,
but you <i>did</i> say it.
And it doesn't mean that
you have to be punished for it.
What it means, though,
is there's no strategic plan.
It's not selling, Erin.
However, when I went viral,
that inventory I'm sitting on
would be completely gone.
But you can't
predict viral.
You're right,
so I prepared for it now,
so now
I have the inventory.
You keep saying,
"I went viral."
You're answering future problems
with past solutions.
I am here because this is
how far I've gotten.
Your strategy is hope.
And hope is great,
but in business,
hope is not really
a great strategy.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
Erin, you're a product person
with a great idea.
But I'm looking for the person
that is gonna show me
exactly how I'm getting
to $2 million in sales.
I really struggle with it
because I like it.
And, you know, I didn't know
about large...sweat issues.
[ Laughs ]
And now I do.
And that's great,
and, you know,
Erin, I'm really sorry.
It's a great product,
but I'm out.
Okay.
Erin, the part
that concerns me
is no one wants
to buy into a business
when the sales are sliding,
versus going up.
Sorry to say ?? I'm out.
Okay.
Well,
there's one Shark left.
O'Leary: What are you
gonna do, Lori?
Well, Erin, I will tell you
what my thought is.
You had me at "hello."
Aww.
I get it.
I get this product.
Great.
But my offer
is commensurate
to the work that
we're gonna have to do.
Okay.
Okay?
So I want to be
a 50?50 partner.
[ Gasps ]
Ruh?roh!
[ Gasps ]
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
Lori is interested
in Ta?Ta Towel,
a towel to combat
underboob sweat,
but she wants
half the business.
So I want to be
a 50?50 partner.
[ Gasps ]
Ta, ta, ta, ta!
I <i>will</i> make you a millionaire,
'cause that's what I do.
Um, I mean, I would just love
to jump at that,
because it's amazing and I
really do want to work with you.
Giving up 50% of my company
is just something
that I really can't do
at this moment.
Uh, would you take...
...like, 15%?
?Ohhhh!
?Oh, my God!
20%?
Oh, my God!
I know!
Remember something.
Okay.
Your business has slowed
dramatically.
Mm?hmm.
You need an army
to help you.
I've <i>got</i> an army.
Is there an scenario
where you'd give her 50%?
[ Inhales, exhales slowly ]
You increase the money, perhaps?
Is there any scenario?
Um, 50%, no,
because when I was broke
and couldn't pay bills,
I took an investor,
and I gave them 10%.
So I own 90%.
Listen, I'm gonna ??
Best offer...
$200,000, 40%.
And my army.
Listen, you're gonna make
so much money,
you're not gonna mind.
Uh, would you do...30%?
Ugh.
50% of a watermelon
is a whole lot better
than 90% of a grape.
Yay, I've got watermelons
in here, by the way.
[ Laughs ]
Erin, you got to make
a decision.
This way, you're not gonna be sorry.
You got to make a decision.
I won't be sorry.
Would you be able to go up
in the money, then,
if I give you that much?
Cuban: Oy!
Give her a chance.
That's her option.
Let her speak.
So, your final offer
is...?
$200,000, 40%.
But you will blow this up.
Erin, it's not gonna make
a difference 10% either way.
Make a decision.
But also, Erin, you have
to be happy with it.
You're absolutely right.
Look, I am so happy
for this offer.
I need the help. Like you said,
I've made a lot of mistakes ??
So,
what are you gonna do?
Congratulations, Erin.
Congratulations.
Oooh! [ Laughs ]
I'm just feeling
really grateful.
This has been
a really hard road,
and I really believe
in this product,
and I know it works
so, so well.
And to be able to get a deal
with a Shark that I wanted,
it's perfect.
