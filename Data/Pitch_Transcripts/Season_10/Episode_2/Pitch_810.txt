Hi, Sharks.
I'm Tyson Walters.
And I'm Miles Walters,
and we're from Orange County,
California.
Our company
is Shed Defender,
and we're seeking $250,000
for 10% equity.
?Hm.
For the millions
of dog owners out there,
this is an all?too?familiar
situation.
Greiner: Ew!
Dog hair gets everywhere!
It get all over your house,
it gets all over your car,
Stop with the endless
lint rolling.
[ Corcoran laughs ]
Ugh!
Stop constantly having
to sweep and vacuum.
Let's face it, Sharks ??
shed happens.
But now there's a way
to prevent dog hair disasters.
Introducing
the Shed Defender.
Ta?da!
Come here, Harley!
Come here.
[ Claps ]
?Aww!
?Oh, my God.
?Hey!
?Oh, good dog.
?How you doing?
?Good girl.
Come here, baby.
This is the Shed Defender.
It's a onesie that contains
the dog hair within the suit.
It can be used in the car,
the house,
family and friends' houses,
or anywhere you don't want
to leave a trail of hair.
?Harley!
?It's like long johns.
It is.
The Shed Defender is made
from a lightweight,
eco?friendly,
and breathable fabric
that allows your dog
to shed naturally.
Herjavec: No way!
And most importantly,
it's safe, comfortable,
Tyson's got all the hugs.
Thank you so much.
Tyson will hug twice.
?I can't wait to work with you.
?It's awesome.
Thank you very much.
We appreciate the offer.
?Congrats, guys.
?Thank you. Congrats.
All right, we got Lori.
That's who we wanted.
Lori can bring
a lot to the table.
Her on QVC selling the product
will be great.
She loved it, and she's gonna
sell a ton of them. We know it.
Good job, Harley.
I think you won Lori over.
