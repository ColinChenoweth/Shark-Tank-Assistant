Christine: Our dad was
a boat refugee.
He instilled a strong work ethic
in each of us.
...and the dream
continues now.
We need your money.
?What are your sales?
?A dollar.
?Oh...
?Wow.
I must have a third
of your business.
That's not a good
"Shark Tank" deal.
I'm Gwen.
And I'm Christine.
We're sisters, and our business
is Mavens Creamery.
Mavens Creamery is a
macaron?ice?cream manufacturer.
We sandwich two macarons
with ice cream.
And we only use all?natural
ingredients
for 30 different
ice?cream flavors.
We've both given up
our successful careers
to start a culinary business
with no formal training.
?Hi, Dad. How's it going?
?Hi, guys.
Our dad is our greatest
inspiration,
and we just want
to make him proud.
Our dad is originally
from Vietnam.
He had
to flee the country
from the communist regime
in 1975.
He escaped on a small boat
with 16 other people.
They barely had enough
food and water to survive.
He ended up in San Jose,
where he learned English,
put himself
through college,
and became
an electrical engineer.
He worked two jobs
seven days a week
to make sure that we had
everything that we needed
for a happy childhood.
This one's for
strawberry shortcake.
Right.
Gwen: Now we're at
a pivotal point,
and we need
the Sharks' investment
to fund more
purchase orders,
as well as invest
in automated equipment.
?Ready to eat?
?Almost.
Our dad's dream was
to become an entrepreneur
and have his own business,
but he had to put that aside
to support us.
Now it's on us
to fulfill his dream.
Hey, Sharks.
I'm Gwen.
And I'm her sister,
Christine.
We're from
San Jose, California,
and we're seeking $400,000
in exchange for 10%
of our booming business,
Mavens Creamery.
Sharks, we are the only
manufacturer in the country
that produces
an all?natural line
of macaron?ice?cream
sandwiches.
We take our homemade,
super?premium ice cream,
form them into perfectly shaped
hockey pucks,
stick them between
two macarons
that we make from scratch,
by the way,
creating the perfect
ice?cream sandwich.
[ Chuckles ]
Sharks, we don't want
to sugarcoat this.
We need your money.
Right now, we cannot keep up
with the high demand
and need your help
to scale the business.
Now, let's have
your sweet tooth be the judge.
Who's ready for
macaron ice cream?
?Bring it.
?Yo.
?Bring it on.
?Awesome.
?Oh, wow.
?Oh?ho.
Cuban: Oh, thank God
I'm lactose?intolerant.
Corcoran: It's like
a birthday party.
[ Laughter ]
All righty.
How many calories
is in each one?
?Thank you.
?On average, 150 calories.
?Thank you.
?You're welcome.
So, today, we have four flavors
for you guys to sample.
On your right will be
cookies 'n cream...
Thank you so much.
...followed by
strawberry shortcake,
followed by salted caramel.
?Thank you.
Definitely not least, you got
chocolate?toasted almonds.
?It's very, very good.
?Mmm.
Thank you very much.
This one's almost
like cotton candy.
You bite into it,
and you think you're gonna get
something heavy
in your mouth.
It's light as a feather.
Very refreshing, right?
Beyond refreshing.
It's really good.
It's really, really good.
This is delicious.
Mmm.
Wow, it's yummy.
[normal voice] as it's called,
correctly pronounced,
was developed in Paris...
?Oh, my Lord.
...in one particular venue...
?Oh, God.
O'Leary: ...where it still
exists today.
The <i>macaron,</i>
because it's made fresh
and has
a component of egg,
spoils
very, very quickly.
When you freeze these,
how long is the shelf life
of the <i>macaron</i> part?
Not the ice cream.
That can last indefinitely.
Yes.
But have you ever
taken one of these
and frozen it
for two weeks
and see what
it tastes like afterwards?
Yes.
Six months.
?R??
?See? He's wrong.
Greiner: And that's what
I was gonna say.
[ Laughs ]
He's exactly wrong.
?He's wrong again.
The macaron was not
just an elitist thing ??
Anyway, so, how much have
you guys sold this year?
[ Laughter ]
Year to date,
we are at $1.25 million
in sales.
?Wow.
?By the end of the year,
we will wrap up with
$2.1 million in sales.
?And will you make money?
?And how about profit?
And we'll make money.
$167,000.
So, what ?? what's
your wholesale price,
and what's your cost?
Our wholesale price
is $2.24,
and it costs us $1.08
to make the product.
It retails anywhere
from $3 to $4.
?Great price.
?Thank you.
So, you have
your own factory.
?Yes, we do.
?Yes.
We make everything
in?house ourselves,
the macaron
and the ice cream.
So, how do you
blow this up?
The <i>macaron.</i>
How do you increase it
by tenfold ??
Kev, could you say it
normally, like "macaron"?
The point is, how are you
going to expand?
Because they're very delicate
to bake, as you know.
Mm?hmm.
Is there any way
to scale it into a sheet
where you can stamp out
thousands and thousands?
Have you ever tried
doing that?
Those are called
vanilla wafers.
[ Laughter ]
We're at 200,000
or 300,000 a month.
How big
do you think you can get,
based on
your current factory,
and at what point
do you think you'd have
to open up
another factory
or use a co?packer
to help you grow?
Well,
that's why we are here.
Um, we are almost
at capacity.
Do you have
a storefront?
?No, we do not.
?We do not have a storefront.
So, are you just supplying
different shops
in cooler sections,
like this?
Yes. So, our customers
are the independent retailers,
which are drink?specialty shops,
fast?casual restaurants,
as well as, uh,
grocery chains.
In regionals, correct?
Regional stores?
Regional stores.
Each and every single retailer
that carries our product
actually carries
our freezer.
Yep.
So we have our own
real estate with this wrap.
Cuban: Ah, so that's
your capital cost, right?
So what's it cost
for one freezer?
Uh, for one freezer, it costs,
on average, about $1,400.
?That's not horrible.
?It's so great, though,
because it catches
everybody's eye.
Do you have to fund it?
We partnered up
with an equipment company
to help
supply us freezers.
We pay them a royalty fee
for each unit
that is sold within.
?Did I hear "royalty"?
?[ Laughs ]
?How much do you pay?
?15 cents per unit.
So, how did you come up
with this idea?
Well, it really
all started ??
I'm sorry ??
with our father.
Our dad was a boat refugee
who fled Vietnam
after the Vietnam War,
and growing up,
he would tell us of
his experiences on that boat,
floating, really,
aimlessly for days
and not knowing if he would
live to see the next day.
And we understood
why he worked so hard.
He worked two jobs
seven days a week for 20 years
to provide for our family,
and he instilled a strong
work ethic in each of us.
And fast?forward
to 2014,
I?I reached a breaking point
in my life,
where I was tired
of my career.
I was
completely miserable.
So I set out to follow my dream
to become an entrepreneur.
And even though we didn't have
any culinary background
or experiences,
that didn't stop us.
We utilized our resources,
which was YouTube and Google.
[ Chuckles ]
And that's really
how we learned
how to make
the macaron ice cream.
John: So, what's the long?term
vision for this?
Our goal is
to automate this product
so that we can produce more
and drive labor down.
You want to scale
wholesale, basically.
Correct.
That's correct.
Our labor cost
is really high,
and it's only
gonna get higher.
It's all handcrafted
and manually done.
So, with the automated line,
we'll be able to use
an extrusion machine
where they wire?cut
the ice cream
and assemble it
as it goes down the line,
um, in addition
to packaging, as well.
?Hey, guys, uh ??
?What does that cost?
It costs us
$200,000.
Congratulations on
what you've accomplished.
?Thank you.
?And the product is amazing,
right, just phenomenal.
?Mmm. Delicious.
Here's the challenge,
right?
When business is growing,
it's great,
but your margins
are so slim, right,
$1.08 versus $2.20,
that the minute those sales
decline at all,
then you start to get
this cascade of problems
where, all of a sudden,
the retailer
who's giving you space
aren't making enough money
for that space,
and that's a real risk
for your business.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
But congratulations
on what you've accomplished.
?Thank you so much.
?Thank you.
I love the product,
but I don't always invest
in everything I love.
This is a great business
for you,
but it's not
investable for me.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
?Thank you very much.
?Thank you so much.
John:
I?I love the product,
but I don't know
if I can add any value. I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
You're gonna make $167,000 this
year, and I applaud you for it.
You're asking for
a $4 million valuation,
30 times what
you're gonna make this year.
You're growing,
but you're actually worth
only about $600,000
to maybe $800,000 today.
So I'm just trying to bring us
back to reality here
and say this is
very, very difficult.
Well, Kevin, we're gonna hit
over $2 million in sales
this year alone.
This year.
But your margins
are <i>really</i> small.
Your margins should be almost
twice what they are.
You haven't been able
to automate the process.
That's the problem.
And that's why we're here.
We need to automate
the process
so that we can
drive the labor down
and increase our margins.
I'm out.
Barbara is Gwen and Christine's
last chance at getting a deal
for their gourmet
ice?cream?sandwich company,
Mavens Creamery.
I could add a lot of value, but
I have a couple of questions,
but I would like
to make you an offer.
Whoa.
Do you sell online?
Not at the moment,
but we ??
Were you planning that?
Yes, we just revamped
our website,
uh, to launch e?commerce
in the first quarter of 2019.
We'll be shipping it out in
Styrofoam boxes with dry ice.
Okay, and then the biggest
curiosity is,
how does your father
feel about this?
He's very proud of us.
He still
comes by the facility,
just hops in unannounced,
and he still has
his tool bag and says,
"Do you guys need me
to fix anything?"
That's great.
You know, last ?? last year,
when we moved into the factory,
we ?? we had
a small grand opening.
It was a huge deal for us
because it was a milestone,
working in our garage
for two years
to having our little own
baby factory.
And that's when ??
that's when he broke down
and started crying.
Corcoran: Oh.
And that's the first time
I'd ever saw my dad cry
in my life before.
He's not a sentimental guy,
but he shows it by other means.
And he said, "I only wish
my parents were proud of me
the way that I'm proud
of you guys."
?Oh, wow.
?Aww.
And after that, you know,
we just had an affirmation
that we're gonna continue
doing what we do,
work as hard as we can
to fulfill his dream,
and ?? and make him
proud of us.
Um, he ??
he's our true superhero.
The happiest day of my life
was when I turned 35.
I had my first real profit
in my real?estate firm,
and I ordered
my mother and father
a brand?new
Cadillac convertible
and had my Uncle Richie
drive it down to Florida
with bows on and pull it
into their driveway.
That must've felt
really good.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
Do you know...
...I?I?I don't think
anything
could have equaled
the joy, uh, that,
that brought
back to my family.
I think the main thing
is that we just ??
we hope that we can
give back to them
for the amount of work
that they've done for us.
Oh, you'll give back
a hundred times over.
I'm gonna give you
the $400,000.
You can use $200,000,
certainly in cash,
to upgrade your facility.
I'll give you the other $200,000
in a credit line,
and whatever other monies
you need after that,
no problem, all right?
But I must have
a third of your business.
Gwen:
Thanks, guys.
?See ya.
?Congrats.
?Miss <i>Macaron!</i>
?I'm gonna be fat,
is what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna be happy for it.
Fist bump!
[ Both grunt ]
Christine: I think what
Barbara saw in us
was her when she was young,
struggling,
and when
she finally made it
and she made
her father proud,
just like <i>we</i> are
making our father proud.
So there was already easily
a deep connection there.
Yay!
