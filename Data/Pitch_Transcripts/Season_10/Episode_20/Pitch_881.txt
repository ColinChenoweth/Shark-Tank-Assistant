Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kyle Bergman.
I am asking for $150,000
in exchange for 15% equity
in my company.
Sharks,
we all love comfort.
Whether we're lounging at home,
traveling for work,
we're at our best
when we're comfortable.
That's why
I created my product
combining two of the most common
apparel concepts ??
50% overalls,
super functional,
50% sweatpants,
unbelievably comfortable.
Sharks,
I present to you,
Swoveralls...
?Oh!
?Aah! [ Laughs ]
...the best of both worlds.
My God.
Made from sustainably sourced
organic cotton
right here in the USA,
Swoveralls possess
the functionality of overalls
while also providing
extreme comfort.
Adjustable straps allow you
to find the perfect fit,
and a functional inside,
zippered front pocket
allows you to safely store
your valuables.
Available in a wide variety
of colors and patterns,
we have the perfect pair
for everyone,
from the stadium
to the living room.
So, Sharks...
?"Swoveralls."
...come help the world get
a little cozier with Swoveralls,
the comfiest thing
you never knew you needed.
I have some samples for you,
but before I pass those out,
I would just like to show you
a visual
of how fantastic you, too,
could look
in the Swoveralls.
?[ Whistles ]
Cuban: Yeah, baby.
[ Laughter ]
?Kevin rocking out there.
?[ Laughing ] Mark.
So, Daymond, I have
this gray pair for you.
?[ Laughing ] Thank you.
?You're welcome.
Lori, this black pair
on top right there.
?Oh, my goodness.
?Thank you so much.
?I got the navy for you, Mark.
?Appreciate it.
You're welcome.
Thanks a lot.
Greiner: Well, they're very
comfy?feeling.
O'Leary: The number?one
question is,
can you have
a pee?pee?
?Yes, there's ??
?Yes, yours has the zipper.
?There's a zipper.
?Got it.
?Yeah.
?What about number two?
Women have been wearing rompers
and onesies for decades,
and, trust me ??
and I can show you afterwards
how to go number two
in the Swoveralls,
if you would like.
?Kev, do you have a loose ??
do you have
a loose bladder?
'Cause you always
ask that question.
Do that for us.
Let's talk about
what these cost to make
and how much
you sell them for.
My cost is around $33
to make it here...
Not so bad.
...and I'm retailing them
for $95.
How many SKUs
do you have to carry?
For women, I have extra small
all the way to extra large,
which is roughly ??
?So five or six SKUs.
?XS to XL.
?E?Exactly, yes,
but one of the big opportunities
and one of the reasons
that I'm here today is
that a lot of parents,
mom and dads, have come to me
and said, "I want a youth size.
I want a pair
for my infant."
So, how are
your sales overall?
So, I launched last September,
and in the last 12 months,
I've done a little over
$230,000 in sales.
And so I was direct?to?consumer
and just through Amazon.
Customers were reaching out.
"We want more colors."
And what I did is I did
a Kickstarter campaign in July,
and I raised about $75,000.
It's amazing because I'm able
to mitigate the inventory risk
by allowing people
to pick colors and sizes.
And so after
the Kickstarter part,
I was able to look at the demand
model by color and size.
O'Leary: Daymond,
you're the fashion expert.
Why wouldn't this get ripped off
immediately when it goes ??
?It will, but so what?
?I mean, listen,
anybody can put two holes in
a blanket and call it a Snuggie,
but look how well
Snuggie did, right?
However,
inventory's an issue.
The only thing that killed
more people than the plague
is inventory, right?
[ Laughter ]
So my concern is that,
most likely,
50% to 60%
of his color requests
are gonna be black,
right, like in any line.
He's gonna then splinter it,
have all these other colors.
You know, I'm not sure
how it's gonna work.
Well, D?Daymond,
you actually almost nailed
our color and
sizing profile.
I am definitely looking
at this as "Less is more."
I want to see the 20% of the
SKUs that do 80% of the business
and kind of mitigate
the risk from there.
I think that I've missed on
about $100,000 in lost sales
in the last 12 months
because of some opportunities
that have come up
where I didn't have
inventory available.
Part of the reason that
I didn't was because
I didn't have enough cash
to make more,
which is part of the reason
that I'm here today.
Kyle, can I tell you
what's gonna be
the huge challenge
in this business?
Um, I learned a most valuable
lesson recently
buying into
the Comfy brand.
Only had two prototypes ??
nothing else.
And in nine months, they've had
$25 million in sales.
What was the appeal of
that garment that they had?
And I felt like I'd found
what the secret sauce was.
One SKU, one size to
a huge audience of people
that found
a use for it.
I think this has too many SKUs,
it's too narrow?market,
and on top of that,
I think it's on trend
because overalls
are so popular,
but I don't think
that's going to last.
And I just don't think
it's gonna be an easy climb
to make money on this.
So, sadly, I'm out.
Okay. Thank you, Barbara.
To kind of answer some of
Barbara's concerns,
I want to take a step back
and tell you guys
what I plan to do
with the money.
And the first thing
I plan to do
is to scale production
in the existing inventory
with the SKUs
that I know are working.
The second thing
that I want to do
is to diversify
the product mix
while the brand
has momentum.
Plus?size,
youth, and infant.
Another area where people have
been reaching out to me a ton
is the college market.
Kids at colleges ??
Yeah, but these are
all splintered markets ??
more SKUs, more size,
more colors, more sizes.
Cuban: Yeah, Kyle,
you're kind of answering
all the questions
the wrong way,
in my opinion, right,
because
if there was enough demand ??
You talked about selling
out with the inventory
you had, right?
But if you saw
enough intrinsic demand,
you wouldn't
have to be thinking about
all these other markets.
It would be,
"I can't keep up,"
and that's not the sense
I'm getting,
and so for those reasons,
I'm out.
?Okay.
?But I wish you the best,
and congrats.
?Thank you, Mark. Thank you.
O'Leary: Kyle, I actually
always concern myself ??
when I look at
the apparel business,
it's always about the inventory.
Always, always.
And, you know, we've had
so many different ideas
come through here.
And every time you look at it
and the entrepreneur says,
"I want to go into infant
or child or teen,"
that's just more SKUs.
I?I can't
get excited about it.
I don't know how I'd get
my $150,000 back.
And it's not about just
getting the $150,000 back.
I want to get
$2 million back, and...
I don't think that's
gonna happen here.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you, Kevin.
I'm gonna tell you
a?a quick story.
Under Armour and FUBU started
the same exacted time,
but Kevin concentrated
for 10 years
on his moisture?wicking
shirt.
I decided to do
a million different SKUs.
He's doing $4 billion
in sales annually,
and I'm doing
5% of that.
Because he concentrated
for 10 to 15 years,
and he never lost focus
on that goal
on what he was
going to do,
and he provided the best
one thing that he could.
And, unfortunately, you haven't
figured that out yet,
and that's why
I'm out.
Daymond.
?So, Lori?
?I would think that the answer
would be, you <i>have</i> one thing.
?Yeah.
I mean, there's only
one thing I see here,
which is the Swoverall.
But I think you have
a lot of marketing to do.
For right now,
it's a little early for me.
I'm out.
?Okay. Thank you, Lori.
?Thank you, Kyle.
?Good luck.
?Good luck, Kyle.
Thanks, everyone.
