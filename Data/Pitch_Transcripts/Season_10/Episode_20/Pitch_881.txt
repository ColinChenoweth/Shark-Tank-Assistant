My name is D'ontra Hughes
from Los Angeles, California.
My company is SPARE.
I'm seeking $500,000
for 3.5% of our company.
Ooh.
We've all had the experience
of searching too far
and too wide for an ATM.
There's never one
near when you need it,
and, unfortunately,
when you do find one,
well, it's not your bank's.
Here comes those insane
third?party ATM fees.
I spent $5 just for
$20 of my own money.
Mm.
That seems a bit
ridiculous, right?
Well, fun fact ??
the average ATM fee
in the United States
just last year was $4.69.
There weren't a whole lot of
options until we came along.
SPARE's a virtual ATM network
that provides cheaper,
more secure
and convenient access to cash,
all from the comfort, security,
and convenience
of your mobile phone.
Getting cash
with SPARE is easy.
Once you connect
your bank account
or digital wallet to the app,
you select the amount of cash
that you need.
The map will then populate
with all the merchants nearby
that are willing
to dispense that cash.
You're given a one?time use code
that you then scan
for verification.
Scan the code
and get your cash.
You're on your way.
It's just that simple.
You get the cash you need
at a cheaper rate
than using a third?party ATM.
And the best part?
You're supporting local business
with increased foot traffic
and revenue.
From tourists to video?game
players with virtual tokens
they want to cash out
to prepaid card users
or on to the much larger
global marketplace
of the unbanked
or underbanked.
So, Sharks, who wants to invest
their spare cash in SPARE?
Greiner: So, that's ??
that's interesting to me.
So, what's the rate?
If, let's say,
I need 20 bucks?
$3.
The way the split works
is we get roughly 1/3,
and we split 1/3 with that ??
with the merchant.
And then, of course, there are
processors in that equation.
And who does
the other third go to?
Uh, our processors.
So anyone ??
Okay, so you're using
a third?party network.
?Exactly, yes.
?Okay.
How much can I take out?
Can I take $500 out?
So, as of right now, we do
max the system at $100.
?But the thing ??
?How do you find your merchants,
and how many do you actually
have in your network?
So, over
the past couple years,
we've amassed a little
over 2,700 merchants.
Those are regular, small,
mom?and?pop?shop businesses
that really value the increased
foot traffic and ??
And that's over
what period of time?
That's over
the past 2 1/2 years.
Okay, so that's
your problem right now.
Well, so ?? so allow me
to expand on that.
So you all ?? I heard your
exclamation at the valuation.
That's just a gag reflex,
'cause,
you know, 3.5%?
Come on. Seriously?
Of course.
But your numbers may
actually make me ??
make you right, so...
?Yes, so let me get
to one important
number for you.
My vision for this company
has to become ??
to be the ubiquitous
cash?out option.
The only way for us to do that
successfully and virally
is to partner with
a hardware company.
We've done that.
A company by the name of BVPOS
has come in as
our strategic hardware partner.
Why hardware?
They have 933,000 units
that will be uploading
our software to their units.
You're saying they have
registers in the stores already.
They ?? Yes, they already do.
They have ??
Okay.
They have units like this one
you see here.
?In every state? How many ??
?BVPOS is what, technically?
They are a POS?hardware
manufacturing company,
one of the five largest
in the world.
So they provide
the register
and the print of
the receipt system
for all
the small stores.
That's correct.
Yes, that is correct.
But are they already
in that many stores
and in multiple cities?
?Yes, absolutely.
?Are they in every state?
?Who aren't they in, right?
Because 933,000 seems
like a huge number...
Absolutely.
...but relative to the,
you know, retail landscape,
et cetera, that's not
a big number, right?
Correct,
and so, they're
a smaller company.
So one of the biggest
issues that we had
as we wanted
to scale this vision out
was proof of concept.
You go to a chain like 7?Eleven,
and you're like,
"Partner with us."
They go, "Go get volume."
So that's what we did.
We proved with
our 2,700 locations,
which is incredibly small...
?Right.
...that we could add value
to our customers.
How many transactions
are you doing a day?
So, on average, we hit
somewhere around the mark
of 2,500 to 2,700.
?A day?
?Right now?
?A day, yes.
?Wow.
?2,500?
?Yes.
O'Leary:
And how many locations
do you have right now?
That's a lot.
?2,700. A little over 2,700.
?No, it's not a big number,
'cause they only make
a buck a transaction.
Exactly.
It's not a big number.
?Yeah, but it's a big number
for how many ??
for just starting.
And what is your background
prior to this?
So, my background, um, I used
to work at J. P. Morgan,
and I had this brilliant idea
[chuckles] in 2010
that I would become
an entrepreneur.
But I've gone through
the process
of sleeping on couches,
sleeping in my car,
all to raise money
for this thing
that I think adds
mass amounts of value.
?How much money have you raised?
?$500,000 to date.
?Okay. From who?
?Um, friends and family,
and then we also had a small
convertible?note round.
And what was ?? what's the cap
on the convertible note?
The convertible?note round
at that time was $9 million.
?$9 million?
?Yes.
?$9 million?
?Wow.
?Yes.
?Wow.
O'Leary: How did you
convince anybody
to buy into
a $9 million valuation?
I don't get that at all.
?D'ontra's a sales guy.
?[ Chuckles ]
?So, um, yes, I am a sales ??
D'ontra, can I
ask you a question
about the difference
in cost?
So, I use you,
I pay $3.
I use any other ATM,
of which there's millions...
?Yes.
?...I pay $4.69,
so 1.69% more.
Am I actually gonna walk
an extra block for 1.69%?
Do I really give a...
?You do if you ??
?No, but that's proximity.
It's not the walk. It's ??
?Well, here's the thing.
You do care if you're part
of the unbanked
or underbanked
population.
What you call
"underbanked population,"
I wasn't sure
what that meant.
Underbanked is someone who
doesn't have the same access
to financial tools
as everyone in ??
as the people
in this room, frankly.
So they don't have
a Citibank card. I see.
Cuban: When I was broke and
sleeping on the couch, right,
I couldn't open up
a bank account, right?
You needed
to have 200 bucks.
You needed this,
you needed that, right?
?I see.
?They didn't give me one.
If you're someone who's living
paycheck to paycheck,
you're using our system
nine times per month.
That change in
what you would spend,
that difference between
the $4.69 and that $3
is a difference between
eating and not eating,
and that's how significant
our value is
to that particular
demographic.
O'Leary:
I wish you the best.
By the way,
the $14 million valuation,
I didn't even get a chance
to beat you up on that.
?[ Chuckles ]
?It's ridiculous. I'm out.
Sure.
I think it's a needed idea.
I think it's a smart idea.
I don't think that I would be
as good a partner for you
as other people sitting
here beside me.
Of course.
And solely for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.
I can't relate to this,
so I don't think
I'm going to be
the best partner for you.
I'm out.
John: I'm still struggling with
how the logistics will work,
'cause I'm just seeing
that a lot of store owners,
they don't want to carry
a lot of cash on them.
The store owner's making $1
per $100 transaction or $2?
?A dollar per transaction.
?A dollar.
So that means I have to risk
$1,000 of my register for $10.
Which is no different
than the ATM.
You have to keep in mind ??
?I know, but the ATM
doesn't have
a manpower there.
I just think, logistically,
it's going to be a challenge.
So I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I love the idea,
but 3.5% is not enough,
because, look,
you have the authenticity.
You need credibility,
right?
Yes.
?That, I obviously bring, right?
?I'm here to make a deal.
I'm here to make a deal.
Yeah, 3.5% is not gonna
get that done.
Okay.
So you've got to make it
worthwhile for me.
Um...
Mark, would you
be interested at 5%?
?No.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Okay.
?Because it means
I'm gonna have to keep on
putting money in
just to stay up
at 5%.
You get diluted by 5%,
you've still got
60?some percent.
I'm gonna be the face,
in a lot of respects.
?What are you thinking?
?Mark, give him an offer.
I mean,
for $500,000,
I need 15%.
Ooh.
?I got you.
?Appreciate it, D'ontra.
Congrats.
Hughes:
I gave up more than I wanted to,
but nevertheless,
having Mark Cuban come on board,
it was worth it.
It was monumental.
It's life?changing for us.
Life?changing for the company.
[ Chuckles ]
Life?changing for me.
[ Laughs ]
