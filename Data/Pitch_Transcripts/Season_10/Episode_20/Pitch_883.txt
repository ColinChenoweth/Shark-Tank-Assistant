Hello, Sharks.
My name is Nicholas Michalak,
and I'm from McLean, Virginia.
My company is Somnifix,
and I'm seeking $500,000
for 10% of the business.
Quality of sleep is
a rapidly growing issue today,
but most products on the market
are, quite frankly, gimmicks.
We all know people
who don't sleep very well.
We all know
people who snore.
What most don't realize
is that these people
often have something
in common ??
they're mouth?breathers.
So, Daymond, come on up.
You're gonna play
our mouth?breather today.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Here we go.
?Do you snore?
?Do I.
?[ Laughs ]
So, go ahead. Hop on the bed.
Just relax.
Maybe get up close
to the pillows.
One of the biggest issues
facing mouth?breathers
during sleep is snoring.
John: [ Snoring ]
So, you guessed it, Daymond.
Open your mouth.
Let's hear your best snore.
[ Snores
exaggeratedly ]
[ Laughter ]
Come on,
let's get a snore.
[ Chokes, gulps ]
?Well...
?[ Laughs ]
Michalak:
...I'm not sure what that is,
but mouth?breathing
worsens sleep quality
and leads to discomforts
like dry mouth, sore throat,
and nasal congestion,
among many others.
[ Snoring stops ]
But simply closing the mouth
and breathing through the nose
can change everything.
And that's why we created...
Somnifix mouth strips ??
the ultimate sleep solution
that stops mouth?breathing
in its tracks.
Here you go, Daymond.
We're gonna try this thing on.
?A piece of tape?
?Close your lips.
I'm gonna help you
put this on
and then just pat it
into place.
O'Leary:
Put one on his nose, too,
and we can say goodbye to him.
Our hypoallergenic strips are
the first and only product
on the market that gently holds
the lips closed
to direct air flow
through the nose.
And that means
deep, quiet sleep.
As a safety feature, each strip
includes a small breathing vent
that allows for mouth?breathing,
if necessary.
Daymond, thanks so much.
I'll let you get back
to your seat.
Corcoran: Can we see what
you look like, Daymond?
Greiner: Yeah, come here.
Come here.
Leave it on.
Leave it on.
Sharks, the solution to
a good night's sleep is here.
So, who's going to join me to
change the way people breathe,
one closed mouth at a time?
?Let's see some samples.
?Yeah, bring some up here.
Daymond, I have another box
and sample for you.
John: Thank you.
There you go, Lori.
Thank you.
Oop.
?Here you go, Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you.
?Oh.
?There you go, Barbara.
?Thank you.
?Thanks, Nicholas.
?Thanks, Mark.
?Appreciate it.
What I'll do is,
I'll put it on myself
to show you
exactly how it works.
So, with each
one of these strips,
the first and
most important thing is
that you want to remove any
balms or lubricants on the lips.
You want to close your lips,
and you want to just make sure
that the vent is right
where your lips meet.
So, I'll put it on.
I'll also show you
what happens
if I block my nose.
You'll see that I can breathe
through my mouth easily.
So here we go.
?Thank you.
?Thanks, Nicholas.
?Good luck, Nick.
?Take care, bud.
Thank you very much.
Really nice meeting you.
Thanks.
Mark, how many people have
come in here with real studies?
?None.
?Yeah. Right?
I mean, that's the first one
I've ever seen.
Michalak: I'm humbled.
I'm grateful
to have an entrepreneur
like Mark Cuban
who sees our vision.
I was expecting him to actually
offer an even lower valuation.
He ended up offering
right at our floor.
I was happy to accept it.
And I can't wait to get
started working with him.
