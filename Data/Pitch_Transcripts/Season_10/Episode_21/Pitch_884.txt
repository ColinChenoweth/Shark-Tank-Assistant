Hello, Sharks.
My name is Cedric Cobb.
I'm from
St. Louis, Missouri.
I'm the president and CEO
of Best Wardrobe Solutions.
I'm seeking
a $200,000 investment
for a 15% stake
in my company.
You know it's been said
that clothes make the man,
and truer words
have never been spoken.
But when a man is left
to a world of fashion,
he's lost.
But that's where I come in.
Take a look at these
good?looking gentlemen
I brought in here
with me today.
Good?looking suits,
nice?looking ties,
but something's missing.
Well, it's all
in the details.
They need
a pocket square.
?Yes!
?It's an old accessory
with a century?old
problem
of how to keep pocket squares
looking good all day.
So, I am actually
the inventor
of the best
pocket?square holder.
Here is how it works.
You just simply style your
pocket square like so,
you insert
your pocket square
into the pocket?square
holder like a clam.
Now, we simply insert
the pocket?square holder...
...Bam!
Problem solved!
?[ Laughs ]
?Voilà.
Cobb: Look at what
we have here.
So, Sharks, join me
in raising the self?esteem
of men
all around the world.
Can we try one?
Can we see it?
Absolutely, you can.
All right,
so, listen.
We have some special styles
for you guys.
You have what's called
the Rose Fold.
You have the Signature Fold.
?Thank you.
Cobb:
Mr. O'Leary, you're looking
at the Straight Fold.
What do you
think, Lori?
I think
it looks nice.
Real quick, I want to go ahead
and dismiss my guys.
Gentlemen,
thank you so much.
[ Chuckling ] I like that
on you, Kevin.
It looks like money.
Herjavec: Oh, that ?? that
looks good, Kevin.
Cobb: Kevin, I think
I like that on you.
Yes!
?[ Laughs ]
?Walk this runway. Let's go.
Let's go, Kev.
Ooh, la, la.
?Okay.
?That's style right there.
?Put your shoulders back.
?There you go!
?Oh, nice, Kev, nice, Kev.
?Stand up straight!
Cuban: Now you're killing
this pitch, Kevin.
Cobb: I don't think
he can stand up straight.
?[ Laughs ]
?Work it, baby, work it!!
[ Laughs ]
This is the new thing
you need
for your 20
all?the?same suits.
?Absolutely.
?Just change your pocket square.
That's exac??
Oh, my God.
?Right?
?I love you so much!
I hope you have
some sales, buddy.
Seriously, because he ??
I don't need to do the pitch!
You got it!
[ Chuckles ]
O'Leary: Okay, let's get
to the numbers.
So, the product itself
retails for $19.99.
What does it
cost you to make?
It costs us
to make it $3.40.
?Okay.
?Have you sold any?
Yes, we've sold
52,000 of them.
?Wow.
?Whoa.
?Good for you.
?Is that lifetime?
That is ?? That's lifetime.
So, we've been ??
So, what's this year
gonna be in dollar sales?
$398,000.
That's still great.
Where are you selling them,
and how are you
selling them?
So, we actually sell them
on our website.
We sell them
through Amazon.
We sell them
through Etsy.
We also do some
major events, as well.
So, like, church conferences,
uh, national conferences
for, like, urban leagues
and things of that nature.
And you have
a little booth there
and you're
selling them direct?
Uh, my booth is not little.
We actually ??
[ Laughter ]
We try to do it big.
Look, I'm 6'5", 290 pounds.
I try to do everything big.
?[ Laughs ]
We also wholesale
the product, too.
$7.50 is what
we wholesale it for.
?Okay, it costs ??
?How much of your business ??
the $398,000 ??
is wholesale?
Wholesale is about
70% of our business?
Oh, okay, that changes
the dynamics.
Yeah.
Look. I think
it's a great business,
but at the end
of the day,
it's just wholesale
distribution of a good product,
and I just don't
see it as a fit for me,
so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you so much.
So, before we get
into everyone else,
I think it's really important
that you guys
get an opportunity
to meet
one of my newest
business partners,
and, uh, he's got
a couple cool words to say.
You may recognize him.
?Oh, my.
?Hey!
?What's up, Ray?
?There you go.
?The legend.
Greiner:
All right, wait...
Cobb:
So, Ray and I have ??
Tell me who the legend is.
I can't ??
I may seem stupid,
but I don't know.
No, it's okay.
So, Ray Lewis actually
just got enshrined
into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame.
He's most notable
for how inspirational he is.
He's a guy that really
understands
the imagery of things
and how, you know ??
Daymond, I even
seen some things online
where you talked about
the importance of
attention to detail
in how we look.
And growing up, also,
an African?American kid
in a neighborhood
where people don't necessarily
take you seriously
until you look
a certain way,
this has kind of
become a staple for me.
?Cedric.
?Yes, ma'am?
Do you run the company
by yourself?
No, I do have
a small team.
So, I have 10 seamstresses
that work for us
that ?? that are kind of
spread out all over St. Louis,
and they do
piecemeal work for us.
Oh, so you make this
in the U. S. A.
Yeah, in the U. S. A.
Matter of fact,
my mother is my director
of product development.
You could cut your cost
dramatically on this.
You know that?
?I'm so glad you said that,
because that's
what we're gonna use
a portion of the money for,
okay.
Yeah.
We can drive our cost down
by about 40%
by taking
all of our operations,
bringing it into
one wheelhouse,
and making it
all assembly?line work
instead of
piecemeal work.
You know, Cedric,
I never thought
you'd be selling
$400,000 worth
of pocket?square holders.
?Yeah.
I mean,
kudos to you.
?Thank you. Thank you.
?You've done an amazing job.
It ?? It's not
a business for me.
I think
it's too niche.
Congratulations to you.
?Thank you so much.
It's just not for me.
I'm out.
Awesome, thank you
for your time.
O'Leary: You know, Cedric,
if I got behind this
and added this
to my...look,
it would just
take it to the moon.
I believe it, 'cause you'd be
a great project for me.
[ Laughter ]
So, you know,
I basically ??
Yes, because the only difference
would be his pocket square.
[ Laughs ]
These Sharks don't understand
fashion branding.
That's what I'm all about.
Now, this ??
the problem is
52,000 units ??
it's a very small business.
There's nothing wrong
with it.
If I get behind this thing
it's gonna be
a big deal.
This is how
I'd do this deal.
I give you
the $200,000.
This is a pure royalty play ??
no equity for me.
I get a $1.50 a unit,
and I get behind it.
Kevin has offered Cedric
$200,000
for a royalty of $1.50
per unit sold
for his men's fashion
accessory company,
Best Wardrobe Solutions.
I would do that deal
and make it part of my look.
I'd be handing this out
to all the guys I work
with on television.
How long does
the $1.50 last?
How long are you bleeding him
for a $1.50 per unit?
How long
are you gonna be alive?
[ Laughter ]
Cobb: I plan on living
to a healthy 90.
So you want $1.50
in perpetuity?
You got it.
And you keep the equity.
You control the company.
You decide to sell one day,
that's cool,
but I ??
everywhere I go,
I'll make sure
the guys I work with
get one of these.
I'll be handing them out
all over the place
and explain to them,
"It's part of my look now."
That's powerful, buddy.
Very.
Okay, thank you, Kevin.
It's an offer.
So, here's my, um ??
my thought process.
I'm sitting here
saying,
"Okay, well,
where can I add value?"
It can't be sales,
'cause you're doing amazing.
"Maybe I can take this thing
and light it up a little bit,"
but then all of a sudden...
[ Chuckles ]
...Ray Lewis comes on.
I just don't see a place
that I add value,
and I'm just sitting here
trying to find a way
I could be your partner.
I just will not add
any value to you,
so, for that reason,
I'm out.
?Wow, okay.
Listen,
I was trying to think, you know,
how could I add value,
bring help.
I could help you bring the cost
down on the product.
Yeah.
But I do think that,
to Kevin's point ??
oh, God ??
[ Laughs ]
...that he could be
helpful in, you know,
wearing it,
being a fashion something.
A brand ambassador,
Lori.
A brand ambassador.
?He's gonna hurt the image!
So...
I?I feel like he has
a good offer there to you.
I don't think that
I would be giving you
a better offer.
So, I'm out.
Herjavec: All right,
you're down to Kevin.
And then there's one.
What are you
gonna do, big guy?
You do look good
in that, Kevin.
So, we talk about
the $1.50 in perpetuity.
Would you be able
to assist me
with going to
a Men's Wearhouse.
Okay, so
I'm gonna go everywhere.
I'm gonna call up
everybody,
and I'm going to also
be handing this out
to a lot of people that
I know in business saying,
"Look, I've made
this my solution.
Here's why it works."
I'm incentivized
to sell it
because I'm getting
a little piece
on every transaction.
?Sure.
?That works.
Cedric, come back
with a counter.
?There's no counter.
?Tell him what works.
Look, I want to sell
a million of these units
so I can make $1.5 million.
Here's what you do.
You say to him ??
"Can you get down the cost
on the product?" Right?
Of course I can.
Get down the cost
on the product,
and then the $1.50
won't hurt.
It is a lot
more justified at that.
Volume reduces cost.
Now, I didn't hear if you said
you were okay going offshore,
because this could be
manufactured
for a fraction
of what you're paying.
This could be made
for under two bucks,
maybe even under
a dollar.
Well, actually,
here in the States,
just with
the investment itself,
we're gonna drive
the cost down to $2.04.
Yeah, but it could be
significantly cheaper.
?Mm?hmm.
?That's true.
I think you should
keep it in America
and give me that same deal
for a dollar royalty.
