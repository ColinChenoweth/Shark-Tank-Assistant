My name is Anna Skaya,
I'm the founder of Basepaws,
and this is my cat, Koko.
And today we're asking for
$250,000 for 5% of our company.
?Wow.
?So, I adopted Koko
at my local shelter,
and she stole my heart.
She sleeps in my bed,
eats my food, steals my socks,
and I think
she could read my mind,
but how much do
I really know about her?
Cats can't speak, but
their DNA speaks loud and clear.
?Meow!

Basepaws is the world's
first DNA test for cats.
We give powerful insights about
your cat's ancestry and breed,
genetic traits, and disease.
And the more you know
about your pet,
the longer you will have
to love them.
We send you a cat kit
in the mail.
It has a swab
and some adhesive tape.
You put the tape on your cat,
whisk it off.
It's a little bit
like waxing your cat,
but it really
doesn't hurt them.
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
We process the sample
in our lab,
and we send you back
a comprehensive report.
We can tell you if your cat
is part Persian
or part Maine Coon and
if it has any specific diseases
that you should
know about.
Just imagine what we can do
for animal health
with this type of database.
Our big mission at Basepaws
is to make the world
better for pets.
So, Sharks,
it's a hot space.
We're first to market.
We've got a great team.
The time to invest is meow.
[now]
?Meow!
?Meow!
Anna, I think
it's really amazing that
you've adopted
a?a starving actor.
[ Laughter ]
Anna, do you have
samples for us?
Yes, I do.
Thank you for asking.
Um...Koko!
Cuban: Put her
on your lap, Robert.
Come on! Aww!
Can you
please take two?
Thank you very much.
?Thanks, Anna.
?Thank you.
?Yeah.
?Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you very much.
?Thank you.
?Oh, it comes with a little toy.
Thank you, Koko.
Do you want to say "bye" now?
?Bye, Koko.
?[ Laughs ]
?Bye, Koko.
?Bye, Koko. Thank you.
O'Leary:
There's a swab in here.
I thought you tore out
the hair follicles.
Skaya: You do both.
So, sometimes your cat can be
a Sphynx cat,
which has no hair...
?Right.
?...so we have to send a swab.
?But only for cats?
?No, not only for cats.
We have big plans.
Next year, we're actually
launching a dog product.
We have a lot of interest
from people
to launch
a horse product.
There's no consumer
DNA test for horses.
But, Anna, isn't there
a consumer product for dogs?
You can
definitely do dogs.
There's two companies
that have...
It's just
a different test.
...been before us that are
doing a dog DNA product.
It's double the price
because they have a much
different technology,
which is kind of old?school
and not as agile as ours.
So your unique factor
is the way you do it.
It's your technology.
Correct.
And one of
the biggest things for us
is to go beyond just
doing a consumer company,
like the cat kit,
and work with
nutrition companies.
Right.
The name of the game in
the pet space is nutrition.
Tell us how much it costs
to get the tests done.
?It's a $95 product.
?Whoa!
It costs $25
to make this test.
How long have you
been on the market?
10 months.
?How many have you sold?
?We've sold 2,500 cat kits.
We've had $200,000
in revenue.
We're gonna make $400,000
this year.
How much
have you raised?
?We raised $350,000.
?At what value?
It was a convertible note
on a $3 million cap,
and we built the whole company
on $350,000.
So, this is IP, R&amp;D,
lab, everything.
For a biotech company,
it's, like ?? it's amazing.
And you send it
out to a lab.
We have our own lab
here in Los Angeles,
so we do the whole process ??
getting the DNA back,
extracting the DNA,
doing everything
ourselves.
Meaning you lease it or you
purchased all the equipment?
We're renting benches
the same way
you'd rent an office space.
How did you launch?
What was your mode
of selling?
So, we launched through
our website and on Instagram.
?Instagram is ??
?That's it?
Oh, yeah,
it's made for us.
We make really funny,
cutesy ads with lots of cats.
People love it.
?And what's your history?
How did you
get to this point?
So, Basepaws is
my fourth company.
Wow.
I founded a company
and sold it to Groupon.
I was the CEO
of Groupon Russia ??
500?person business.
This is what I do.
I build brands.
I graduated UCLA.
Both of my parents
are biologists.
Actually, I spent more time
at a laboratory
when I was a kid
than on a playground.
O'Leary: Anna, if you're
about to buy an expensive cat
like some rare
chocolate point Siamese
or something.
I used to live
with two of those things.
I really hated them.
?[ Chuckles ]
But there's some
expensive breeds, right?
Skaya: Oh, absolutely.
I would love to tell you
how we work with breeders.
But could I take
the Basepaw test,
send it in,
find out if I have
a defective unit here or not?
That's exactly
what we're doing.
We're like the CARFAX report
for breeders,
especially
international breeders.
So, imagine you spend
$5,000 on the cat ??
It's that much ??
$5,000 for a cat?
Oh, of course.
But, Anna, I just want
to go back, though.
You're not the first
animal?testing
DNA product, right?
We are the first company
that does this for cats.
In your technology,
could I send you
horse DNA,
and could you
do it today?
I can do it
by the end of next year.
And what do you have to do
different to get there?
Create a new pipeline,
create a new test
but with the same machines
that we have.
Listen, I love cats.
I'm a cat person,
but do you think that
people care more about
testing of their dogs
than they do their cats?
There's a lot more money
in the dog space.
The cat section
is, like, this tiny,
and the dog section
is the whole store.
Cats are underfunded,
understudied.
There's actually more cats
in the United States than dogs.
People don't spend money
on cats
because cats
are very protective.
They don't tell you
if they want something.
But for
the last 10 years,
things have really shifted
in the cat space.
Now there's people
walking cats.
You've probably seen this.
?There's the cat cafés.
?Cat cafés, thank you.
?You can't walk a cat.
?Oh, yes, you can.
?Look, I'm interested.
I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I would do the $250,000
for 8.3%,
and I want 1.7%
in advisory shares.
That kind of puts you around
the $3 million valuation.
I add too much value.
I want something for it.
So 10%.
$250,000 for 5%
is basically
what the other investors
have come in with.
?But they're not a Shark, Anna.
?Anna, you can't come in here
and tell us
why we're not of value.
?Oh, but you are.
?Come on. I'm a Shark.
I mean,
I'm not just any money.
Yeah, but I would love you
as an advisor,
so I really like your deal.
?Yeah?
But I would love to see
if anyone else is interested.
I'm sure they are,
but I'm giving you mine.
Greiner: Well, Anna,
I'll share with you.
You say you're going
to kill it this year,
but so far
in the 10 months,
you only sold
2,500 tests.
So, it doesn't give me
enough confidence
at this moment
in which to invest,
but I wish you good luck.
?Thank you, Lori.
?I'm out.
I was somewhat interested,
but my offer will be
nowhere near as generous
as I think Kevin's is,
so I'm out.
Mm.
Cuban:
Yeah, Anna, look,
I think what
you're doing is great,
but I think scaling's gonna be
a lot more difficult
in terms of what it takes
to do the labs at scale,
do all the testing
at scale,
so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
So, Robert?
So, Anna, I'm sitting here
listening to the other
Sharks drop out,
and I'm thinking,
"What are they missing?"
I'm amazed.
I'm jumping
up and down.
Why isn't everybody else
jumping up and down?
I love the technology.
A friend of mine's
a big horse broker.
You could charge
thousands for that test.
Yep, absolutely.
Kevin, what was your offer?
?My offer is 8.3% for $250,000
plus 1.7%
advisory shares,
and I think I add
a lot of value,
so you should
consider that.
I'll make you
the same offer.
$250,000 for 10%.
Would you guys
do a deal together,
and would you
lower the equity?
There isn't enough.
Getting two Sharks
is a big deal.
It doesn't happen
very often.
I would do the deal with
Robert for the $250,000,
and we would
do it for 10%.
And we don't care
how do it,
whether it's common
or advisory shares,
'cause it's gonna be
subsequent rounds.
So, Kevin,
are we splitting the $250,000
so $125,000 each?
Yes, and you get 5%.
Okay.
You can do
the last points.
I would do that deal
with Kevin.
What do you say, Anna?
