Hadley: Try this.
Hadley: Now, I know
what you're thinking ??
"What is Chicken Bang Dip?"
That's what
I was thinking.
Well, Sharks,
do I have a treat for you.
Yeah!
I came up with this
chicken?y, cheesy,
saucy, spinach?y,
scrum?diddly?umptious dip
that will keep folks
coming back for more.
In short, you can
put this Bang on anything!
?Mm, I like to bang things.
?Anything!
I put it on rice, pasta,
vegetables, a burrito.
I even put it
on my omelette.
[ Laughter ]
Now, some people
don't eat chicken.
No problem!
I have a vegetarian version
that I use zucchini in
instead of chicken.
?No!
?And guess what.
?What?!
?What?
It's Bang?tastic!
?Bang!
?Now...
Ba?bang!
...maybe you don't
eat cheese.
I got you covered.
I have a vegan version
that my wife makes
the cheese from scratch
out of cashews!
?Cashews?!
?Yes, sir!
?Really?
Now, there is no question
that this is popular,
and one thing
I know for sure ??
you could help me
get this Bang Dip
in every door,
every store!
Bring people together
like never before!
[ Laughter ]
So, Sharks,
who wants to get
this Bang in your life?!
?Let's Bang!
?Yes!
?Yes! [ Laughs ]
?Bam!
?Wow. Wow.
?Ba?bang!
?Yeah!
?[ Laughs ]
?He needs more energy.
?[ Laughs ]
?Whoo!
?How you feeling?
Hadley: I've given it everything
that I have, and it's mine.
It's not gonna stop.
I'm gonna keep going.
You know, this Bang Shack train
is not stopping.
