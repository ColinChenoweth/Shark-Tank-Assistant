My name's Jason Woods
from Pleasant Hill, California,
and I'm back
in the Tank today
seeking $250,000
for a 5% stake
in my company...
?Wow.
...Kymera Body Board ??
the world's first all?electric,
jet?propelled body board.
?No way.
?Now, as you may remember,
my last lap around the Tank
didn't go so well.
Let's take a painful trip
down memory lane.
?Whoops.
?Wow.
?Some strong opinions there.
You <i>love</i> punishment.
You love it.
But I got to use
my want?repreneur line,
so I was happy.
Greiner: Oh, my gosh...
Go ahead, Jason.
...and to walk
back in here ??
Woods: Well, all I have
to say is
you were right.
I took everything you said,
as brutal as it was.
I quit my job.
I threw aside
the want?repreneur attitude.
And, Mark, you said
I should find somebody
to help me run the company.
Well, I did.
Hey, Adam.
Majewski:
Hey, Jason.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Adam Majewski,
and I handle the operations
for Kymera Body Board.
We took the garage prototype
that you saw last time
and evolved it into
something truly remarkable.
[ Rock music plays ]
Herjavec: Wow.
We now have
a fully?refined product
that's ready to scale
and hit the market.
Oh, and we didn't
stop there.
John: Okay, so ?? so, Jason,
uh, you know,
we ?? we beat you down.
You said
we'd helped you, right?
You come back and ask
for $250,000 for 5%.
This is
how you thank me?
[ Laughter ]
Thank God
you like me, right?
Imagine if you were mad at me.
?Jason, how much does it cost?
How much does it cost?
The product sells
between $3,250 and $3,750
based on accessories.
?Which product, Adam?
Which product?
?$3,250.
Is everything about
the Kymera board
that's in
the black and white there?
That's what is fully done,
and that's what
we're talking about.
That's what
we're talking about.
Yeah, correct.
Body Board is what's
currently available.
And, Jason,
how much is the Body Board?
It retails
for about $3,500.
?$3,5000.
?That's a lot of smackolas.
And a typical jet ski can vary
anywhere from, like, what?
The start at about $7,000,
range up to about $15,000.
Okay, so much
less expensive.
?Yes.
?What's your cost to make one?
About $1,800.
O'Leary: That's not
so good for margin
if you have two tiers
of distribution.
Correct.
So, I'm gonna make
the assumption.
I want one, okay, and I buy
lots of stuff for my lighthouse.
I want to see Kevin
on one of these things.
What's the game plan
for world domination?
So, first off, we have
direct?to?consumer sales,
and we'll set that aside
for right now.
We just signed a deal
four weeks ago
with one of the largest
luxury?boat manufacturers
in the world, and
they're giving us access
to all 225
of their dealers
that will start carrying
this product out the door.
?How many did they order?
?The open house
with all their dealers
is July 29th.
So you don't have
the orders yet.
Correct.
This all comes down
to cash management, right?
So, you've raised
$625,000.
When was the last time
you raised money?
How much? How much do you
have in the bank?
$625,000.
The last raised was
the $7.5 million valuation.
What will sales be this year
with everything you know?
?We're projecting $2 million.
?But you've sold none so far.
No, we've sold
$350,000 year?to?date.
We've sold $900,000
in the last 12 months.
Woods: The biggest problem
we have right now
is we've never had
any inventory,
so everything we have sold
is at least three months out.
O'Leary: So, let's say
you do $2 million.
What will the company make
on the $2 million in sales?
On the $2 million,
$600,000.
That's after you pay
yourselves something?
No, that's top line,
so we're looking
at about 17%?20%,
which falls in line
with boat manufacturing.
I'm trying to figure
out as an investor
how I get paid back.
You're basically telling me
you're worth 5 million bucks,
but you're basically gonna break
even on $2 million in sales.
Herjavec:
Adam, isn't this exactly what
he said to you last time?
Is it like
a rewind button?
Greiner:
No, but he's a lot happier
standing here today.
I mean,
the reality is
we're in a very
different place now
than we were
back then for sure.
Agreed, but why are you
worth $5 million?
One important thing ??
the reason we built
these other prototypes
is because this is
a scalable technology.
So, this right here took me
12 years to get to work.
I built each one of those
in two weeks.
Wow.
John:
So, you have sales,
and you have distribution.
What do you need our money
and/or our help for?
It's inventory.
I mean, that's where
we've been stuck.
I'll make you an offer,
but my biggest concern
is this thing
just sucks cash.
I'll never get
my capital back.
But here's the only way
I would structure it.
I'll give you
the $250,000.
I want 5%
of the company,
but I want to get paid back
500 bucks a board...
[ Chuckles ]
...until I get back $750,000.
?[ Laughs ]
Now, if you don't like it,
Mark, let's see you step up.
$500?!
No, it's just
your logic, Kevin.
It's just
your logic, Kevin.
I don't want
to hear a lot of noise
from the peanut gallery.
?[ Laughs ]
Um, why don't you just
say, "Uh, no."
?Um...
?I wouldn't say "no"
until you know
you have another offer.
I have another offer
for you.
Jason and Adam have an offer
on the table from Kevin
for their personal
watercraft company, Kymera,
but Daymond
is also interested.
I have another offer
for you.
So, I'll offer you
$250,000 for 10%,
and I will handle and deal
with the factoring,
the licensing,
and that area.
'Cause I think that's
how you're gonna scale.
That's a better deal
than I would do. I'm out.
That's a crazy deal.
You should do mine.
Why would you give up
that much equity?
Herjavec:
Adam, I love the product.
I love this kind of cool,
funky, go?fast stuff,
but I got to tell you ??
you got to stop doing this
right now,
'cause this is cash burn,
this is defocus.
Got to sell
a lot of these.
Yeah, and my intent always
with the kayaks ??
there's so many great
kayak manufacturers out there.
I don't need to be
a kayak manufacturer.
You can drown
in opportunity
when you're starting
a business, as you know.
Right, right.
Absolutely. So ??
O'Leary: Is there an offer in
this lecture for you, Robert?
Well, I thought I'd lecture
for a little while here.
Listen, I'm very impressed
with your determination,
your drive, and, uh, I think
it's great what you've done.
Thank you, Lori.
It's not the right
investment for me,
so I'm out.
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.
O'Leary:
Robert, back to you.
Love it.
Love the second chances.
I mean, that's one of the things
that makes this country great.
Everybody deserves
a second chance.
So, Kevin's offer was
he's gonna give you money ??
$250,000 for 5%
of the company.
I get $500 a unit
until I recoup the $750,000.
So when you bankrupt them,
how are you gonna
get your money?
?They're not gonna go bankrupt.
?Yeah, like...
?We would have no money.
?Are you just making noise,
or are you gonna
make an offer?
Herjavec: Oh, come on.
Daymond,
what was your offer?
Yeah, and my offer
is $250,000 for 10%.
My interest is to add
the value for licensing
and finding him
the right factors,
the things
they need to scale.
I know this space.
I think you need more money.
I'll give you
$500,000 for 10%.
Woods: "Redemption" is
the only word you can use.
You know,
if you're willing to give
everything that you've got
to what you believe in,
you can make it happen,
but it may take a long time,
and it may be harder
than you think,
but it's totally worth it
in the end.
Robert, you just became
a want?repreneur.
[ Laughs ]
A moment of silence for
$500,000 that just died.
Silence for the $500,000.
?Oh, my God.
Narrator: Earlier this season,
we had our first "Shark Tank"
High School Sweepstakes
to inspire high school kids
across the country
to be entrepreneurs.
Four students won
a video?chat session
with their favorite Shark...
Hey, Hudson.
You're someone I've looked up to
for, like, so many years.
I'm all yours.
Whatever you need
from me, buddy.
Thank you so much
for all the information.
...and one student won
the grand prize ??
a trip to visit the Sharks
on the set
during a taping
of "Shark Tank,"
and there was
an extra special surprise.
[ Student chanting
"Shark Tank" ]
Cuban: Some of us Sharks decided
to visit Boca Raton, Florida,
to meet Madison,
the grand prize winner
of our "Shark Tank"
High School Sweepstakes.
We also brought along
the Junior Library Guild,
and Zoobean, one of my early
"Shark Tank" investments,
to gift educational software
and books to Madison's school.
We're donating to your school
in her name
over 1,000 new books
for your school library.
We're going to give our
software mobile app for free.
Burke: Now what you've all
been waiting for ??
we're gonna have
a question?and?answer session
for the Sharks.
What inspired you
to become who you are today?
Well, Boca Raton
inspired me.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Webb: This high school
is really special to me
'cause I actually attended it.
I feel like being here today is
gonna inspire these students
and make them feel
like they can do anything.
What advice do you have
for small?business owners
in their first year
of operation?
What types of
marketing strategies
help expand and grow
your business?
True entrepreneurs
start out seeing that
there's a problem
that nobody is addressing.
Cuban: It doesn't matter
how many times you fail.
Sometimes you just
got to go for it.
We want you to take
our seat over one day.
That's the whole plan.
O'Leary:
We want kids to know
that they can control
their own destiny
by focusing on
their own futures,
making their own decisions,
and becoming entrepreneurs.
I want to thank you guys for
coming and, of course, Madison.
Madison:
I'm a huge "Shark Tank" fan,
and getting to meet the Sharks,
watching them speak,
it has been such
an amazing experience.
Cuban:
The beauty of "Shark Tank"
is that anybody
can start a company.
Doesn't matter
where you grew up,
the situation your family's in.
Doesn't really even matter
what kind of business.
It can be big or be small.
But you have a chance
to be on "Shark Tank,"
and who knows
what can happen from there.
All you have to do
is take that first step,
and anything is possible.
All: "Shark Tank"!
[ All cheering ]
Hadley:
My name is Jason Hadley,
and I live in Miami, Florida.
I've had a tough life.
Growing up, my mom
was on food stamps, welfare.
When I was 8 years old,
it's when it really got bad,
and we ended up
losing our house.
My mom struggled,
but she did what she could
to make sure we ate.
When I was 15 years old,
I found out my girlfriend
was pregnant.
There was no question
I was gonna raise my son.
I was gonna be there, and I was
gonna show him a real father.
Something I never had.
At this point in time,
I was doing a lot of bad things,
and my son saved my life.
If I did not
have my son at that age,
I'd be either locked up or dead.
I ended up being
the first male in my family
to graduate high school.
I found out I had
a real knack for sales.
I sold computers, I sold cars,
I sold furniture,
and I excelled at it all.
Pretty soon,
I'm gonna be able to sit down
and let you take over.
Today my son, Jaylon,
is my best friend.
He said, "You have so much
positive energy,
and this business allows you
to utilize all your skills."
Get some
of that in your life.
I decided
to invest in myself.
My life has showed me
that resiliency
can help you
to overcome any obstacles.
My name is Jason Hadley,
and I'm seeking
an $80,000 investment
for 20% stake in my business,
The Bang Shack,
and my product,
that world?famous
Chicken Bang Dip.
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
Am I gonna
be excited, Jason?
Oh, yes, sir.
And I know you're a gentleman,
so I'll give you Lori's.
?Oh, thank you.
?Thank you.
?There you go.
?I'm gonna bang 'em all.
[ Laughter ]
All right,
here you go, Daymond.
Cuban: Let's bang.
Oh, Mark, you're gonna
love this.
Bring it. Bring it.
Bring it. Bring it.
I see the stadium
written all over.
?All over.
?Oh, that's good.
?Mmm. It's good.
?Yeah.
Oh, it's good.
It's got a little buffalo
in the Bang.
That little kick
lets you know you're alive.
Herjavec: There's some garlic
in there.
?Ooh!
?That was Bang?tastic.
?Oh, that's so good!
?Yes, sir.
Where are you
selling this?
In the farmer's market
in Florida.
That's all you're doing
today with it?
Good for you.
Right now,
we're building up
on farmer's markets
to get the name out there.
And, with it being
a fresh product,
you know, we figured
that was a good way
to get the name recognition,
brand recognition.
Jason, that presentation
was amazing.
It was great,
one of the best ever.
Thanks, Daymond.
Appreciate it, guys.
John: Talk about yourself,
'cause I want to know
where that all come from.
Okay.
'Cause we need to buy
some time so we can eat.
?All right.
?Right.
Well, I came from,
um, a large family.
My dad wasn't there.
You know, we were raised
by my mom,
and, uh, we didn't have much,
so I always, you know,
felt that it was my job
to take care of the family.
So, I'd get out, mow lawns,
you know, go sell candy bars,
newspapers.
I found out
I was real good at sales.
You know, went through
a lot of things,
had my son at 15,
you know, but all ??
?You had a son at 15?
?Yes, but it ??
it was a blessing.
He gave me another reason,
you know, to push,
you know, to wake up
in the morning
not just for me but for him.
And I've done well at sales.
And after being in sales,
you know,
and making so much
for other people,
I had this dip
that I'd put together,
and I'd bring it
to any type of get?together.
They're like,
"J, bring the Bang!"
?"Bring the Bang."
?You know, so I'd bring it.
They'd be blown away,
and I'm like,
"Man, I'm gonna do
something with this."
So, me and my wife,
we went
to the farmer's market.
We set up a booth,
two crock pots.
We sell out
every single weekend.
?People are trying it, right?
?Wow.
Oh, yeah.
They sample it,
they try it, they buy it.
Like, you're making it
right there.
Right there.
Right now,
we have a larger booth,
and we have 12 crock pots,
and people come line up.
How much have you sold
over the last year?
January 2017
till the end of the year,
we did $53,000,
and this is at
one farmer's market!
That's crazy.
This is two days
out of the week.
Can they buy it online
or anything?
Not yet, and I have my website
all the way done,
but doing that
out of my crock pots ??
that's why I came
to you guys.
Greiner: What do you do
the rest of the week?
Search engine optimization,
marketing.
Why is your website
not up and running yet?
Oh, it is.
Okay.
I have the website
all up and running.
Why have you
chosen not to sell then?
Yeah, why haven't you
done that?
Because, again,
I'm selling out of crock pots.
Like, to ship that
all over the country
out of crock pots ??
Or you just put it in
the same type of containers.
Yeah.
?Right, but ??
?Well, you have to learn that.
You have to learn
how to do that.
To make it
more in bulk,
you know,
to handle that business.
You know, right now, we started
at a second farmer's market.
That's why we should
be making $88,000
by the end of the year.
?Wow.
?Really?
O'Leary:
What's the game plan for you
here today on "Shark Tank"?
What's the big plan?
I'm going to get
a commercial kitchen
where I make it
more in bulk,
but also, I want
to get it in stores.
How do you package it?
Do you have one here?
Uh, not out here.
Then why haven't you
done that, Jason?
You are good at sales.
You did a great
presentation today.
Yeah 'cause
that's the scary part.
All the skill you have,
great product,
and you would think you would
have figured these things out
to get it so that
you had a product,
you had a jar
already in place.
The reality is, you're
looking for that person
to help you
formulate everything
to get the right packaging,
to help you really
turn it into a product
and into a company,
and that's just
a lot of work right now.
I do have the packaging,
though, Mark.
Not to interrupt you.
?But you didn't bring it here.
?I have my labels. I have ??
You didn't
bring it here.
You know, we have
no way of seeing it.
And so
congratulations, man.
I'm a huge Jason fan.
Keep on selling.
But for right now,
I have to say I'm out.
?Thank you, Mark.
?Congrats, man.
?Thank you.
John:
You know, even if you
put it in stores,
how do you get them
moved off the shelf
is my biggest challenge.
You're gonna have to do
countless trunk shows
and bring you there
every day.
You can't be
everywhere.
For that reason,
I'm out.
I?I respect that,
Daymond.
Here's the thing.
You know,
I love the dip,
and I believe that
you could sell anything.
You have a very charismatic
personality that people like.
I wish you luck,
but right now,
it's too early for me,
so I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Jason, you came here
too early.
I don't need a job.
What I need to do
is use my leverage
to make more money
with you.
This isn't
investable, yet.
I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
Yeah, you know,
uh, Jason,
there's a transition
between being a salesman
and being
a business guy.
If you had
a package with you...
?Yes.
?...if you would've said, "Look,
I've had a test run
in this store," I'm gonna say
I think you would've got
an investment today.
You had a kid at 15.
I can't imagine the pressure
and responsibility of that.
I mean, that's real life
responsibility.
If you can do that,
you can learn this.
?Yes.
You're gonna fail,
and you're gonna get
knocked down,
but you just got to keep going.
You just got to keep going.
You'll do it.
For now I'm out.
Thanks, Robert.
Thank you.
I appreciate it, guys.
?Good luck, Jason.
?This is really good.
?Thank you.
?Just heart?breaking,
you know.
The amount of work
that it would take
to get this launched...
There's just so much work.
Unbelievable.
Herjavec:
You know, that's the problem.
After 10 years,
you learn how much work it is.
