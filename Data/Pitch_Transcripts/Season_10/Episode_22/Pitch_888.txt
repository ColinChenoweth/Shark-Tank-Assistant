Bolos: We want your help
to bring DeskView
to every window
around the world.
Narrator:
...and chasing their dreams...
Where do your envision
your business going?
World cookie?dough
domination.
?Wow!
?You're an amazing operator.
O'Leary: But I want
a little more equity.
I'll do it for 50%.
?You've got to be careful.
Kevin is a vampire.
?Silence, please.
?What's that, Mike?
?[ Chuckles ]
Risk fumbling
making a mess
with your dipping sauce
or, heaven forbid,
having to eat
a ketchup?less fry.
?[ Groans ]
?[ Groans ]
?That's disgusting.
?I know.
We could not stand
for this any longer.
That's why we took fate
into our own hands
and molded from
the clay of the Earth
the Saucemoto Dip Clip...
?? Ahh ?
?Wow.
...a condiment holder
designed specifically
for your car.
[ Laughs ]
Saucemoto isn't just
a cup holder for your sauce.
No, it's a purveyor
of freedom.
Its universal clip
attaches to just about
any vehicle's air vent,
and its unique
5?in?1 aperture
holds sauce from just about
all fast?food restaurants.
?Oh!
?Bravo! Bravo!
I've probably
been there.
Mike, how are people
gonna find you?
We knew that nugget culture
is actually really real ??
?There's a nugget culture?
?Absolutely.
We built this
for virality.
We did,
uh, a?amazing videos,
and those just went viral.
We had 44 million views...
?How many did you sell?
...over ?? over Facebook.
Do you guys really
expect to sell,
like,
millions of these?
?[ Laughs ] Mustard.
?Mike, you're the man.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Mike Bolos.
And my name
is Jason Grohowski.
We're from Chicago, Illinois,
and our company is DeskView.
We're here
seeking $150,000
for 7.5% equity.
Sharks, we are living
in the age of glass.
New buildings, both
residential and commercial ??
they're all glass.
Those drywall conference rooms
are now glass fishbowls.
Closed?off office spaces
are now open?concept layouts.
With all this glass,
where do you work?
You can sit at
your standard desk,
hunched over
like a Neanderthal,
or you can create your own
personal standing desk
and have the best view
in the office with...
Both: DeskView.
In the office, DeskView
works great on external
and internal
glass walls,
freeing you
from your desk.
At home, DeskView's the ultimate
minimalist standing desk.
You can move DeskView
to wherever you want to work ??
in the office
or at home.
Want to eat breakfast
while watching the sunrise?
Use a DeskView.
[ Herjavec laughs ]
Ooh!
[ Laughter ]
To uninstall,
simply pull the levers
and DeskView
comes off.
Look, Sharks! No marks!
The install
is just as easy.
Bolos: DeskView
is overengineered,
made with aerospace?grade
aluminum housings
and industrial?grade
suction discs.
DeskView is safe on glass,
can stay on for years
on a single install,
and hold more weight
than you'd ever need.
Want to prove it?
Sure.
Don't try this
at home.
We are
trained professionals.
?Oh, my God.
?On glass? Really? Wow.
?Wow.
?We want your help
to bring DeskView to every
window around the world.
So who wants to come up
and try it for themselves?
Who wants
to help me down?
[ Laughs ]
Can it go anywhere
that's not glass?
So, we have
a couple photos.
DeskView works like
melamine top surfaces, tile.
?So it works on a steel case ??
?Smooth and nonporous surface.
Herjavec: Oh, you can use it
in the bathroom.
Exactly. So that's
one of the uses ??
Greiner: Marble.
Oh, okay.
So it's not just glass.
Smooth and
nonporous surfaces ??
It works on
metal surfaces.
And how does it
actually attach?
It's suction force.
So what we did is
we took the strongest suction
discs in the industry
and then we re?created
and built the housings for it
and built some new mechanisms
around it.
What do you sell them
for and what does it
cost to make them?
Yeah, and how many
have you sold?
The white and the Bamboo,
those are our Minimalist
and our Natural.
They retail for $235.
Our ??
?$235?
Yes. And our clear
Baller retails for $265.
?And what are your costs?
?And how many have you sold?
?We've sold 800 to date.
?800,000?
800 units.
In how many years?
We just received our inventory
in April of 2018.
You didn't mention what you ??
what they cost to make.
Yes. So, our costs are currently
$80 landed for the units,
but I've been on
an absolute binge
reducing our costs over
the last couple of months,
and I have them down
to about 25% to 30%.
Well, you have great margins ??
$80 versus $235.
Greiner: Yeah, why are you
doing such a high margin?
'Cause you don't need to,
and, you know,
for a desk
like this, it ??
it seems pretty
expensive, right?
Grohowski: This is actually one
of the lowest?priced desks
that you can get
in an office environment.
That's true.
So when we talk
to people in offices,
they're actually blown away
about how inexpensive it is
compared
to everything else.
Yours is $235.
What's a typical stand?up desk?
I just don't know what it is.
I mean, your typical
full standing desk
can range from $500
anywhere up to $2,000.
So, there aren't
cheap models out there?
We're kind of that add?on
into your office ??
or especially in the apartment,
your studio apartment.
We're kind of the only option
for a standing desk.
So, Mike, you've sold about
$70,000 altogether,
$80,000.
?We're at about $162,000.
This month,
we'll close $100,000.
And that was all
on your own website.
Oh, this month,
you're gonna do $100,000?
?We're gonna do $100,000.
?What happened?
So we started marketing
in the direct?to?consumer space,
but strictly
on our website.
What we started noticing
is companies
were buying
dozens of units.
So at that time,
we realized,
"Okay, let's, um, focus
on the B2B market."
There was a big large
furniture expo in Chicago.
We didn't have $10,000
to throw out for a booth,
so we got scrappy and
we put up four DeskViews
on the side
of a coffee shop.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
And so that was
in the main thoroughfare.
There were people coming out
of the coffee shop,
and they knew
exactly what to do.
They were using it,
as you can see.
Greiner:
It makes them stand there.
Tell us about you guys.
How did you come up with this?
I, uh, got my B. S.
with studies
at Cornell, Harvard,
and Oxford
and then went on
and got my JD/MBA
at the University
of Pennsylvania.
Went on, practiced three years
in commercial litigation
and then three years
in corporate transactional law.
I got put
inside an office
that I just couldn't put
a standing desk in.
I actually went to the doctor,
and my doctor said,
"Mike, you have tendonitis
everywhere from the hip down."
It was from sitting down.
I mean, we're ??
we're cranking 80?,
100?hour?plus weeks regularly,
and I was just
stuck sitting.
But I had these
floor?to?ceiling windows
'cause we were
in a downtown office.
I was like,
"That's perfect."
So I started
building, tinkering.
I did the first 18 prototypes
with $200 in cash.
?Good for you.
?So there was some demand,
especially
in my office.
Everyone's like, "What is that?
Where did you get that?"
Started selling those
a little bit,
and it was actually about
time that I met Jason.
Yeah. So, uh, we met
through a mutual friend,
and he showed me
the initial prototype of this,
and immediately
it clicked in my head,
because I spent the past six
years working with companies
talking to executives.
"We want standing desks.
Our employees are demanding
them, but they're so expensive."
You're a furniture guy,
Jason?
Uh, commercial
real estate broker.
I don't know
if I see it as a desk.
The surface area
is just too small.
Well, one second.
I'll actually show you
another one that ??
Bolos: 'Cause I never stop
working on innovation.
But over time,
the square foot per employee
in company offices has gone
from 250 square feet
down to 120.
?I don't disagree with you.
That's why people
want to stand.
So, this guy,
I call the Big Baller.
Um...
?The Big Baller.
14 inches deep.
Yeah. So, we added
a couple more inches
for those that
have larger laptops.
What price
is that gonna be?
We're gonna
price that $275.
Corcoran: Can I speak from
a perspective of an employer?
When I built my offices,
I was meticulous
about the design
and hated it
when my salespeople
even put their kids in frames
on their desk shelves.
It just messed
the whole place up.
You spend tons of money, you
want gorgeous corporate office,
and then people start
bringing their tchotchke.
I hated it.
To a corporate client, B2B,
which is your specific model,
you want someone
to buy 50 of them.
Could you imagine 50 of these
along the plate?glass windows
of an office building
in Midtown Manhattan?
?It's terrible.
?Good point.
I see it as a consumer,
individual?sale market.
I really do.
So I don't believe, frankly,
in any of the directions
you're going in,
so I'll have
to graciously step out.
I think it's a beautifully
designed product.
You've obviously put
an incredible amount
of work on it.
It's so sturdy.
But, you know,
I'm kind of sitting here, and
I wouldn't use it as a desk.
I can't get there. I'm out.
?Thank you.
I mean, I can see it
as a complement ?? I mean,
you know, to my desk
or in my office
or if someone's coming in
from the outside ??
keep two of them
in the closet
and setting them up
where you need it.
But, you know,
I agree with Barb
that I see these more
in the home.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
?Okay. Thank you.
?Thank you.
I prefer this selling
directly to consumers online.
The margins
are pretty good.
I don't mind exploring
the, um...
the whole thing, B2B.
But you're gonna find out
how tough that is,
and it just ??
it just sucks cash.
Look,
I'll make you an offer.
?Wow.
?Wow.
I'll give you the $150,000.
I want 15%.
Thank you
for the offer.
I don't see it
as a permanent desk
for somebody
using it all day long.
But I thought it was
really interesting,
I actually think,
for commercial space.
Like, you know,
there's never enough room
at a Starbucks
or this or that.
I thought
that was really smart.
But I don't like
your price point.
I've done a lot of products
over the years,
and the one thing I know
is things that soar,
things that
really do great,
are things that are a good idea
that people like,
but if you can give it to them
at an affordable price,
if they're
on the fence at all,
they're gonna buy it.
I respect the margin that
you feel you want to make.
The big question is,
is really how low can it go?
So, with what
I've been able to do
over the past
couple of months,
plus the volume?based
discounts,
we should be at around
$45 landed, $46 landed.
So you can
cut it in half.
?Yeah.
?Yes.
All right, I'm gonna give you
a really Shark?y offer.
for 15%
of Jason and Mike's
mountable stand?up
desk company, DeskView.
But Lori
is also interested.
All right, I'm gonna give you
a really Shark?y offer.
I would want to be...
a third partner.
?Oh.
?33%.
?? Dun?dun, dun?dun, dun?dun ?
?$150,000 for 33.3%.
?Ouch.
?Because I feel like
we'd have to go to a million
factories and cost this out
where it could be something
where we'll sell
hundreds of thousands
of units, not thousands.
There's blood
in the water now, Mike.
Bolos: Well, yeah,
and with our ??
With the projections
of these, you know,
multi?billion?dollar
distributors
that we're talking to,
I mean, they're saying
they'll move 900 units
a month next year.
They're salespeople.
They tell you
what you want to hear.
?But here's the difference ??
Greiner: I don't want them
moving 900.
I want them
moving 90,000.
So you guys know,
the more I think about this,
the more I listen to Lori,
I'm modifying my offer.
I'm going up to 20%.
?[ Laughs ]
I'll give you the, uh,
$150,000 for 20%.
This isn't,
uh, gonna be easy,
'cause I think
it's got to be 99 bucks.
I'm willing to take a flier ??
$150,000, 20%.
You can do Lori's deal
for $150,000 for 33.3%.
You guys have
to make a decision.
Bolos: It's amazing. I mean,
Kevin ?? he's gonna blow it up.
You know, even in
the brief talk that we had,
we know that
he has the ideas,
he has the understanding
of the distribution model,
and we're just gonna kill it
with Kevin as a partner.
