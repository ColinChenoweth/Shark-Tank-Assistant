What's up, Sharks?
I'm Kelsey,
founder and fearless leader
at Doughp Cookie Dough.
I'm seeking $450,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
I'm Dallas?born,
California?raised...
Yeah.
...and I'm loving life
in the Bay Area,
running San Francisco's
first ever cookie dough bar.
?Wow.
?Life is crazy,
and adulting is hard.
But what if just
for a few moments,
you could be transported
back to your childhood,
sneaking bites of cookie dough
in the kitchen?
At Doughp, we serve
nostalgia by the scoop.
We're here for the big kid
inside of all of us.
However, we're anything
but childish.
We're a millennial brand
serving over 20,000
customers each month.
Well, I'm on a mission to get
Doughp in every city in America
through opening additional
high?traffic storefronts,
franchising, and expanding
onto grocery?store shelves.
Sharks, this deal is
too "Doughp" to pass up.
[dope]
Who's in?
?[ Laughs ]
?We get samples?
?You want to try it first?
All right. [ Laughs ]
I've got some samples for you.
?Please.
?Do people love cookie dough?
?Got the mouths watering.
?Well, people that like sweets.
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh.
I'm so stoked for
you guys to try this.
We've got
six different flavors.
There's one plate for you.
?Thank you.
Here you go, Lori.
I've got a special for you guys.
I made a vegan avocado
brownie cookie dough.
Oh.
?Thank you.
?Cute names...
?Thanks so much.
?...Avoca?dough.
?Avoca?dough.
?[ Laughs ]
People love the puns.
?I love the name.
Got to keep them
laughing.
Wow, it's sweet.
?Thank you so much.
?You bet.
?It's really sweet.
?Thank you so much.
Thank you.
So, we've got The O. G.
That's gonna be
your classic cookie chip.
The Vegan O. G. is made
with vegan butter,
so those on dietary
restrictions can indulge.
Kelsey, when did you
start the business?
So, I started
in April of 2017.
Um, I had spent
10 years in tech.
I got moved ??
?Oh, I see the correlation now.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, right? Processor chips
to chocolate chips.
I had been working since
I was 16, uh, at Intel, and ??
?At Intel?
?Yeah.
?Since you're 16?
?Yeah. So...
Why is that?
Uh, I started as
a high?school intern,
but it was really hard on me,
and I put a lot
of pressure on myself,
so I developed a really
unhealthy relationship
with alcohol
through the years...
Oh.
...and Friday,
I turn three years sober.
?Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
Um, so got sober, and that
changed my life entirely.
Uh, I've always had
this entrepreneurial bug,
and doing something
on your own
has just been
the most rewarding thing.
So in a year and a half,
we're over $850,000 in sales,
and I've got plans to ??
?Wow.
Wait, what are you making
on the $850,000?
Yeah, we have
a 35% net income ratio.
?Okay.
?Wow, that's great.
?Um, we've got 14% this year ??
?This calendar year,
what will your income be
pre?tax?
Our net income's $240,000
for this year so far.
Oh, there you go.
And what's your plan
going forward?
Where do you envision
your business going?
World cookie?dough
domination.
Of course.
[ Laughter ]
How are you
gonna get there?
Um, my main focus
is on these high?traffic
storefronts.
I'm in lease negotiations
right now
for a spot
on the Las Vegas Strip,
and the mall sees 72,000 people
per day enter their doors.
Wow.
So, you're here
on "Shark Tank" today
at a $4.5 million
valuation...
?Mm?hmm.
?...and you're asking me to pay
30 times
your pre?tax profits,
30 multiple
on something
that's completely
not proprietary,
because
it's cookie dough.
?Yeah.
?Anybody can do it.
The difference is,
you're a good operator.
Yeah.
Isn't that what always
makes the difference?
No, but it's not
worth 37 times.
It's just cookie dough.
Here's the problem ??
you're gonna grow
until somebody says,
"I want to compete with you,
'cause it looks so good."
?And then ??
?But she has competitors.
Yeah, there's certainly
a lot of competition,
and look at what happened
in cupcakes.
I'd like to compare myself to
one of the major cupcake brands
that made it through this ??
with Sprinkles.
If you recall kind of
this rise,
every mom?and?pop
opening one on every corner.
But there are a few brands
we all know and love
still from
the cupcake trend.
I'm gonna be one of those
for cookie dough.
We're also expanding
into wholesale,
so looking
at grocery stores.
You've got major chains,
like Whole Foods.
?Do you have any wholesale now?
?Um, yeah.
So, these jars are just
starting to hit the market,
and we're in
San Francisco's airport.
Herjavec: Kelsey,
you're an amazing operator.
?Oh, thank you very much.
?Like, your story,
your numbers ??
everything.
I don't like
cookie dough.
[ Mimics crying ]
Just kidding. [ Laughs ]
?I know. I'm sorry.
But how many people
like cookie dough?
I would say
a significant amount.
How many people <i>don't</i> like
cookie dough?
I call the people
that don't like it
"unicorns."
?I?I find it too sweet.
You just have to know
that people love it,
even if you don't like it.
It's got money behind it.
We make a scoop
for 68 cents,
and we sell it for $6.
So the ?? the direct margin
on this product...
?Wow! [ Laughs ]
?...is incredible.
Oh, my gosh.
I feel, like,
ashamed to say that
for customers watching...
?Wow.
...but it's pretty awesome.
We're really cultivating
an experience people are
willing to pay for and ??
And where ?? where's the value
at $4.5 million?
T?Talk to me a little
about that.
Yeah.
S?So I did this valuation
not even including
the Vegas operations ??
just growth of
our own pier store,
growth of local wholesale,
and that's gonna get us
to $2.25 million
next year in revenue.
?In revenue, right?
In revenue, correct.
And what do you think
you'll make on that?
I mean, we've
been moving, uh,
with this 27% to 35%
net income ratio.
I don't think I've ever met
a more sophisticated...
?Yeah.
?...store owner in my life.
?Yeah.
?Wow.
10 years at Intel
will do that to you, man.
I've, uh, watched
some amazing leaders
make really difficult
business decisions,
and it's undoubtedly the reason
this has gotten so far,
that and my sobriety.
?Good for you.
Um, I feel so present
and so focused,
and I just know exactly
where this can go,
and I'm looking
for one of you guys
to help me take it there.
I?I wish
it was something else.
I can't get there
on the cookie dough, though.
I'm out.
?I totally understand. Yeah.
I'm probably pretty much
like, uh, Robert.
I'm gonna go out
simply because
I just don't
like cookie dough.
Yeah.
I understand that.
?It's cute, it's fun.
?Thanks.
I know that there's
a lot of people
that really
love cookie dough...
?Yeah.
?...and you've proved it.
?Uh?huh.
?But it's not something
that is a healthy enough
option for me.
?Okay. It's ??
?So I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
I totally understand. Yeah.
We are looking into, um,
some snack?size packaging,
and something
more portion control
where you can have a little,
eat a little bit.
O'Leary: So, Kelsey,
you've proven yourself
as a strong operator.
Clearly, sales justify
what you're doing.
I'm gonna give you the credit of
making $2.25 million next year.
So, you're basically
going to end up
with around $350,000 to
distribute to investors,
giving you about 5 to 6
times free cash flow after tax.
What's the valuation
of you?
About
1.8 million bucks.
The problem with your deal
was valuation.
?Okay.
?Nothing wrong with you.
Okay. No, I totally
respect that.
I think a lot of ??
There's so many ways to do
valuations in this world,
and, uh, my ??
?Yeah, I do the real way.
He says the same shtick
all the time.
?No worries.
?We're used to it.
I don't see you
writing a check, Mark.
You forgot
to write the check.
?Why don't you write the check?
?Kevin, I wasn't clear.
Are you in or out?
?Oh. Did I not say?
Okay, Kelsey, so that we don't
have to beat each other up,
I'm out.
?Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much.
?But I wish you the best.
?Well, you have Mark left.
?Yeah. I'll ?? I'll ??
?My homey. Texas.
?Texas, I know. Dallas.
?Don't let me down.
Look, Kelsey,
what you've done is amazing.
Everything about it says
it's a good investment ??
Yeah, and I need your help.
The stadiums, the arenas, and ??
Literally, the conflict
I have ??
and this is
the honest?to?God truth...
Yeah. Yeah.
...the whole
obesity thing, right?
Uh?huh.
Just getting behind
a product and saying,
"Eat more,
eat more, eat more."
I totally feel that.
Great business.
Congratulations, but...
?Thank you so much.
?...I have to go out.
Okay.
I totally respect that.
?Thanks for coming.
?You guys were amazing.
I'm, like, so sad I'm not
hugging you right now,
but I'm really excited
for the future,
and I appreciate you guys
taking the time.
?Thanks, Kelsey.
?Thank you guys so much.
?Thank you.
?Uh?huh.
