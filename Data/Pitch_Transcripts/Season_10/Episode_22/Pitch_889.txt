I'm Michael Koury.
And I'm Tony Lahood.
We're from
Cleveland, Ohio,
and we're the founders
of Saucemoto.
Today we're here to offer you
a 15% stake
in our company
for $45,000.
Since the advent
of the drive?through,
we've all been faced with
a horrible decision
when eating
in our cars.
Lahood: Through extensive
field testing
and countless nights
of grueling fast?food research,
we developed Saucemoto
to hold up
to just about
any road condition.
Sharks,
don't try this at home.
?You want to go for a ride?
?Yes. I'm starving.
Let's say you're enjoying
your nuggets
when the driver suddenly turns
onto a cobblestone path...
[ Groans ]
[ Rattling ]
...and suddenly
a strong gust of wind
comes from the east.
[ Louder ] It's hardly
ideal dipping conditions.
But not
with Saucemoto.
[ Exhales sharply ]
?That's right ??
any sauce, any climate,
Saucemoto has
your nuggets covered.
Together,
we could make...
[ Laughter ]
...the ketchup?less fry
a thing of the past.
It's time to practice
safe sauce.
Lahood: So, Sharks, who wants
to dip into this investment
and make sure
no one has to endure
a sauce?less
nugget again.
Who's hungry?
?Yeah.
?Oh, yeah.
?Barbara.
?And a vent, too.
?Yes.
?Oh, thank you.
?More food, just what I needed.
?Just so you can see that.
?I have a question.
?These nuggets are great.
Yeah, these nuggets
are really great.
So, how did you
come up with this?
About 10 years ago,
we were on a road trip,
got hungry, dedicated to get
some nuggets and fries,
and the inevitable
happened,
and I spilled some sauce
in Tony's brand?new car.
And that's when we just
started brainstorming.
"Okay, h?how can we
keep 'em secure,
you know, in the car?"
And ??
You really thought
this was a big problem?
?[ Scoffs ]
?It really is.
?It really is a problem.
?It is for ketchup.
How many of these
have you sold?
?Uh, we've done 12,000 units...
?12,000.
...for about
$77,000 in sales.
Wow.
I'm just curious ??
are you excited
to be here?
I'm not sure I'm feeling
any pulse from you.
No, I really am excited
to be here. I mean...
[ Laughter ]
...we worked
really hard on this.
This is
Tony's natural voice.
Greiner: He's just kind of
a chill, mellow guy.
What do you each do
for this business?
What do you each do? What is
your role in this business?
Each of
our roles? Okay.
So, yeah,
I'm the engineer.
I designed most of it
here, testing, and whatnot.
You're design,
you're marketing?
Uh, Tony and I ?? Well,
I kind of span between both.
I'll ?? I'll ??
From design and creative.
I'll do
any of the graphic design.
We do everything in?house.
Most of the product testing,
too, right?
Oh, yeah. Yes.
Oh, yeah.
And who designed
this package?
?I did it.
?Fabulous design.
Thank you.
It tells you everything
you want to see,
it doesn't take up
any space.
I even want to have one, and
I don't even eat any fast food.
That's the reaction
we usually get, is
when people see it,
they're just like,
"Take my money."
So, what does it cost?
What did you sell them for?
We're selling them
for about $5.75 on,
you know,
our website and online.
Uh, it costs us
about 80 cents to make.
What's your background?
I'm a sales engineer
in the tire industry.
I'm a mechanical engineer
doing product development
for a wood tool company.
?I own a couple of bars.
?Oh, you do? Good for you.
In Cleveland?
?Yeah.
Lahood: A Stanford study
concluded that there's ??
20% of American meals
are actually consumed
in automobiles.
?Wow.
?I eat probably 30% of mine.
?Do you really?
?Yeah.
Yeah, there's a lot of people
who just don't have time,
like, to go home, sit down ??
?But how do we get to them?
So, one of the biggest things
that we've realized
with Saucemoto is
it's an extremely good
promotional tool
for companies.
Greiner: Yes.
So if we approach
a fast?food chain,
rental car companies ??
Um, we are actually
in talks with two major...
Sauce m??
...sauce manufacturers
right now,
um, for
promotional product.
O'Leary:
I think you guys are taking this
the wrong direction.
It's not nuggets.
It's all about the fries.
Everybody eats fries.
I like the deal
'cause I can see
taking it public
on the NYSE.
[ Laughter ]
They'll be ringing
the bell with me.
I think this is huge.
?Hey, Tony ??
?Wait a sec, Barb.
Maybe there's a smoking?hot
offer coming here.
I do see the use of it.
I mean, I eat fries in the car,
and I like to dip my fries,
and it's an issue.
But, you know,
I've got to wet my beak.
I got to wet my beak.
You want a lot of money here.
This is $45,000.
We're not messing around.
15% ?? this imputes a crazy
valuation. You know that.
But I'm willing to go, but I
want a little bit more equity.
I'll do it for 50%.
?Oh!
[ Laughter ]
Thank you, Kevin.
?Thank you.
?We appreciate that offer.
You want to be at the drive?up
window, and they say,
"Look, for
an extra whatever,
you can get
the Saucemoto.
This is really cool.
You clip your sauce into it."
That's where
you want to be.
?They're not gonna sell it.
?It's a complicated deal ??
Herjavec: And they got
their logo on it.
That's a complicated
deal to cut,
but thank goodness
you've met me,
'cause that's the kind of deal I
like to take on as a challenge.
Ooh.
Cuban: Look, I think
it's a great product,
but, like you've already
found out,
you're gonna have to hustle
for big sales across...
Yeah.
...you know, promotional
opportunities.
That ?? That's just
a lot of time,
and it just doesn't get me
all sauced up,
and so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Lahood: Going forward,
absolutely. Yes.
?[ Laughs ]
?I get the dream team.
?That's what you're getting.
?Yes. Of course.
You'd complete
the dream team.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna
help you out here, okay?
'Cause that's the kind
of guy I am.
I'll give you
$45,000 for 40%.
I got to tell you,
it's the team.
Maybe it works,
maybe it doesn't.
I love the three
of you guys
and your ability to create
the videos and the marketing.
I actually think there's
a great product within you.
?And this isn't it?
?This may or may not be it,
but I'll go along
for the ride.
So I'll tell you
what I'm willing to do.
You basically got a third,
a third, a third.
If I come in as a partner,
a very important one
that's willing to work
hard on this,
I'll do it
if I get 25%
so that
we're all equal.
Stop thinking about it,
because the clock is ticking,
and I want you out of here
with me as your partner.
Cuban: He actually would not
be a bad partner for you,
and you knew you were gonna
have to give up 25%.
Yes or no?
Koury:
Thank you very much.
Now let's go make
hundreds of dollars.
?All right.
?[ Laughs ]
Good luck.
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
See you, guys.
Moujaes: Saucemoto's gonna take
off from here, and that's ??
we know Kevin's gonna
open some doors for us.
Now everyone
can practice safe sauce.
That's right.
