Hi, Sharks.
I'm Anthony Pucci.
And I'm Nick Pucci. We're from
Los Angeles, California,
and we're seeking
$350,000
for 10% equity
in our company.
Sharks, it's probably
been some time
since you worked
in a cubicle
or even sat
in an open?office desk.
But did you know
most offices today
feature
an open?design plan?
While it's great for
collaboration and cutting costs,
most employees are less
productive because of it.
And that's because
employees are dissatisfied
with their
work environment.
In fact, a lack of sound
and visual privacy
is by far and away
the biggest strain
on employee morale.
Introducing Cubicall...
?Ta?da.
?...the modern phone booth.
Cubicall is
the efficient solution
to the shortcomings of the
design of modern?day offices.
Our booth focuses on the four
pillars of privacy needs ??
audio, visual,
territorial,
and information.
So distractions
like these...
Whoo! Girl!
I know, I know, I know!
...become a thing
of the past.
[ Laughter ]
And our Cubicall booths
are fully customizable.
They can be finished
in a variety of colors,
materials,
and even custom graphics.
And those bifolding doors
allow Cubicall
to fit into offices where
every inch of space is critical.
So, Sharks,
invest in us...
So we can help employers
invest in their employees.
Which one of you
want to come down
and get a privacy break
from Mr. Wonderful
and test?drive
one of the booths?
Greiner: I do!
?Excuse me!
?I want to try it.
?All right.
?Okay.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Woman: No, we are not
doing this again!
[ Greiner laughs ]
So, Nick, how did you
start the company? Tell us.
So, we started
our own marketing agency.
It was
an open?plan office.
And it's a family
business, so ??
We're Italian, so we talk
very excitedly ??
?What?!
?Yeah. Come on!
And it just got the point
where any important calls
or any meetings
that we had,
we either had to leave
the office to take it...
Go in the stairwell.
...or we had to stay ??
stay home.
I said, "We can't deal
with this anymore."
And after we put it in
our office, the clients came in
and they said, "Hey, can you
get me one of these?"
We said, "Yeah, sure."
?Once you deliver it,
do you just simply
plug it in and it works?
?Correct. Yeah.
?Does it ship flat?
They do have to be assembled,
but as far as ??
?It ships flat.
?We actually have a video,
if you guys want to see it.
?Yeah, sure.
...quickly being assembled,
just a little time?lapse.
?Wow, you guys are fast!
?Yeah, right?
?It's with a little practice.
?Yeah.
?So, yeah, it ships flat.
It's super easy
to assemble.
Nick, have you sold
a bunch of them already?
Yes, we have.
We sold about 70 booths.
We sold ??
So tell us your sales
the last 12 months.
Uh, last 12 months,
$495,000.
And when did you
start the business?
?Last August.
?How are you selling it?
Uh...
Strictly direct
to the end user online.
O'Leary: I like the solution,
but there's a huge problem here.
You're making $1,800
on the 6K version.
Your margins are so thin that
the only way this business works
is selling
direct to customers.
Yeah, but that's ??
This is working for them.
Why would they
introduce all the ??
Guys, it's not working.
You've only sold $495,000 ??
They've been in business
for a year, Kevin.
?Oh, my God. Doom, doom.
?No, but how do you feel
about the margins?
Can you widen your margins?
?We could.
?We definitely can.
If we get the investment, able
to invest in the inventory,
we'd be able to add
another 20% to 30%.
What's the vision?
What's year two gonna look like?
I mean, we want to get
to $2.5 million next year.
That's about
300 booths.
And we think with an investment,
we can definitely do that.
?Do you have competition?
?Right now in the whole market,
there's probably about
four competitors
that we compete with.
Anthony:
Nobody does a bifold door.
It sounds trivial,
but you're putting these in
because space is an issue.
?Okay, that makes sense.
Yeah, but you don't think
that a steel case
could come in and undercut
all of the parts of this
and bring the price
down by 50%?
I?I think they could,
but they ??
they won't hit these price
points at these margins.
I'd find that
hard to believe.
Look, congratulations on
what you've accomplished.
It's ?? It's great,
obviously.
But I've got
a couple issues.
One ??
it's capital?intensive.
Two ?? when you're just
getting started,
it's not unusual,
particularly for ??
when you're cheaper,
to get orders direct online,
but I think you're gonna
have to go to some ??
some other type of
two?tier distribution.
That doesn't mean it won't be
a great business for you two.
It just means
it's harder to invest
and harder to get a return.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
But congratulations on
what you've accomplished.
Well, thank you.
Appreciate it.
?You know, you're a niche
within a larger
furniture market.
I think this is a highly
competitive industry,
and I just don't know
how you're gonna break into it.
?I'm out.
?But ??
Greiner: I totally get it.
My only problem is,
there are competition out there
that are already doing it,
and so I think I'm gonna
wait a really long time
for a return on my investment,
so, unfortunately, I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
Appreciate it.
I mean, just to sort of
paint the picture ??
So, they do say that
80% of all offices
are open?plan
offices now.
By estimates, there's maybe
about 9.1 million businesses,
you know, in the U. S.
If we were even
to sell one booth
to 0.1 of 1%
of those businesses ??
Yeah. Everybody says that
about a big market.
We get it.
Guys, that's the kiss of death
on "Shark Tank."
When you say all you need
is 0.1 of 1%...
?Yeah.
?...that's never a good sign.
Anthony, you got to be careful.
Kevin is a vampire.
He'll live forever.
[ Laughter ]
So $50 is gonna
last a long time.
Um, I have a lot of experience
with this, surprisingly.
Here's my offer.
It's better
than his, I think.
?I don't think so.
?His was so complicated.
I don't know what it meant.
?Mine's pretty simple.
But I'm gonna give you
the $350,000
for 25% of the business.
?Ouch!
?Wait. Wait a minute.
?Ouch.
That's much worse
than my offer ?? much worse.
Are you kidding me?
Every dollar that comes in,
you get 100 bucks.
?And you get triple?paid.
?Mine reduces over time, Mark.
Barbara's forever
25% of the company.
You know, Barbara ??
Greiner: Your ?? Yours reduces
to $50 over time.
That's
very expensive.
What do you
want to do?
?What do you want to do?
?Dude, oh.
Nick and Anthony have
two offers on the table,
from Kevin and Barbara,
for their office booth
company, Cubicall.
?What do you want to do?
?What do you want to do?
Dude, oh.
You might want
to go in a booth.
We can hear you.
[ Laughter ]
?Go in your booth.
?Should we? You want to go?
?Yeah.
?We'll go talk in the booth.
?Ah!
?Ah.
[ Door closes, Corcoran laughs ]
[ No audio ]
Greiner: This is hilarious.
They're using the calculator.
[ Laughs ]
?Oh, Lord.
?Welcome back, Nick and Anthony.
?Oh, thank you.
Anthony: Did you guys hear us,
by any chance?
?No.
?Every word.
?Okay.
?What did you guys figure out?
So, Kevin, we really
appreciate your offer.
Yes.
Uh, it's a little too difficult
for me to figure out
and for the eventual sale
of the company. Um...
It's not a problem
when you sell the company,
'cause they just
buy out my royalty.
That's what happens.
In many of my companies
that's happened to.
?For $1 billion.
?Go on.
?Still a little too complicated.
So, Barbara,
we would like
to counter with
$350,000 for 15%.
It's, uh, not enough,
I'm afraid.
I have to turn that down.
Yeah.
I expect to do a lot of heavy
lifting on this business,
and I have
tremendous contacts
in the contract
furniture space,
and I think I can make
the right introductions for you.
You can't budge
on the equity at all?
Uh, no, because I want
to be excited about it.
?What do you want to do?
?How about ?? Could we do
$450,000 for 20%?
No, I really feel like
I need that quarter slice
to get really juiced up
about it.
O'Leary: Maybe you should
revisit my offer,
'cause it has merit,
actually.
You should
think about it.
It doesn't sound like
she's gonna budge.
Anthony, I don't think
these guys are budging.
What are you guys
gonna do?
What do you
want to do?
Nick: I think we got
a great Shark in Barbara.
With her contacts,
I think it's gonna do wonders
for our business.
I could see her point with
the risk, but I think it's ??
I think we're gonna
do great with it.
Cinnamood is gonna be
like a snickerdoodle
with white chocolate chips.
Raisin' The Roof is
an oatmeal?raisin flavor.
What? What?
He's got it.
?What, what?!
?I see you.
Chocoholic is for
the chocolate lovers.
And then
This S'more is Hella Doughp.
So that's gonna be marshmallows,
graham crackers,
and chocolate chips,
just like a campsite.
Love the names.
Uh, our three sizes ??
Self Control, Legit,
or Fully Commit.
Um...
?Funny names.
So, we've got a storefront
on PIER 39.
Um, it's one of San Francisco's
biggest tourist attractions.
I know it well.
So, is that your only location?
Uh, that's our only
physical brick?and?mortar.
?Is that the actual store?
?Can I, um ??
It is. Yeah.
We do $1,100 per square foot.
?Ooh.
?Wow, that's a lot.
?Wow.
Do you have
competitors?
Yeah, there are
some competing companies.
So, there's one
in New York City,
uh, who's, uh,
sort of on par with me.
It's definitely coming in,
like the cupcake trend
and all that stuff,
where it's gonna take off.
O'Leary: Really?
