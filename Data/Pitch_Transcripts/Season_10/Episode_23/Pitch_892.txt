Armenti: Not only do we serve
your favorite foods,
but we do it all
on one sandwich.
?No!
?Yes!
...and chasing their dreams.
All I need are my
black?belt business partners.
Greiner:
My God. Oh, my God.
[ Laughter ]
So, Sharks,
who's ready to dig in?
I feel the big one!
I feel the big one coming!
And ?? Kevin,
if you don't mind?
You're out there, it's raining.
?Oh, no!
You're running, you're boom,
you're boom, you're boom.
All: No!
You're boom, you're boom,
you're boom.
?[ Chuckles ]
?You're rain??
I'm 100% dry in here,
no problem.
Look, this comes off.
Look. Look at this, you guys.
Costa Rica called.
?"Costa Rica called"?
?You shake it off,
and not only does it dry
100% on the inside,
but it turns into
a waterproof backpack.
imputes a $10 million value.
?I feel you, Kevin.
?So, give me some numbers!
?You guys, it's so comfortable.
Greiner:
Mm?hmm. [ Laughs ]
It's so comfortable
that I want to wear it.
I'll simplify
Kevin's deal.
He'll give you
$500,000 for 25%.
Forget how
he's structuring it.
Are you interested
in that deal?
If we were pre?revenue,
I would consider 25%.
But because we have sales,
it would be unwise of me
to entertain 25%
at this current time.
It's an unknown.
It's an unknown of
what's that worth.
You know, I sit here,
and I always think
I have to do
what's right for me.
I think what's right
for me here...
If you're considering
between me and Kevin...
I'm not talking
to Kevin right now.
I'm talking to you, Lori.
?[ Cuban laughs ]
?Very good man.
?Do you want to talk to Kevin?
Just take a look at some
of our happy customers.
[ Laughter ]
And we have thousands
of amazing pictures.
?Aww!
?It keeps people from 'em, too.
So, which one of you Sharks
wants to help keep
our fur babies safe
and be part of a great
new American brand?
?[ Laughs ]
?That's great.
I do have some samples
I can pass around.
Let's see the samples. Yeah.
We're giving you
our original signature color.
?Thank you.
?For you.
Yes, you can take a look
at the materials
and notice how lightweight
it is.
?Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.
?...thank you, Kevin.
I think
it looks fantastic
because it's funny,
it's fun, it's memorable.
So that's your greatest
advertising, right?
It's just ?? I have
to feel like something
is going
to resonate for me,
and I just don't feel
strong enough about this.
So I'm out.
You know, 85% of
all businesses in America
are small business.
?Mm?hmm.
And most of
the new job growth
is being driven
by small business.
But not every business
needs an investment
or is investable yet.
I don't see
how, as an investor,
I can go on
the journey with you.
?Okay.
?I wish you all the best.
?Thank you very much.
?Not for me. I'm out.
?We appreciate it.
?All is not lost,
because we have a dog lover
here in Daymond.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Yeah, I just want
to make sure I get a chance
to address
Daymond's concerns.
We now have secured
a big manufacturer
who can deliver us
1,000 vests a month.
John: There's a level of
interest I have.
Uh?huh.
But as of right now,
when you're just getting
from that positioning
of, you know,
running your own factory
to a new vendor
and you haven't gone
into large retail yet,
I think you're at
a very pivotal point...
We are.
...where it can
make or break you.
I just think it's a little risky
for me, so I'm out.
All right. Well, thank you
very much, Daymond.
We appreciate
the opportunity.
?Bye. Good luck.
?Bye?bye.
?Come on, Scoot.
?Come on.
?The BatBnB ??
?Sounds like you, Kevin.
[ Laughter ]
The BatBnB
actually bio?mimics
their natural habitat,
which is the space between
the peeling bark
on a dying tree.
And it also provides
an ideal environment
for mother bats to keep
their pups safe from predators.
With a BatBnB on your property,
whether it's your backyard,
your farm, or your business,
you can eliminate
swarms of harmful pests
while also providing
a much?needed home
for a commonly
misunderstood animal.
Before we dive
into questions,
we know that there are a lot
of misconceptions around bats.
So we'd love for
you all to meet one.
?No!
?[ Laughs ]
[ Laughing ]
No, I don't want to.
At this point,
I'd love to invite
our trained
animal handler, Melinda,
to join us onstage...
?Hello, Melinda.
...and introduce us
all to Radar.
?Hi, Melinda.
?Hi.
?Where's the bat?
?She's right here.
Oh, God, Melinda,
don't let it out.
?Let it out!
?Ohh.
?Is it outside? It's inside.
?You can't be afraid of that.
?[ Chanting ] Free the bat.
?So, this is Radar.
It's a 6?year?old rescue.
She had a damaged wing,
so that's why
she's in captivity.
Um, Radar's
a big brown bat.
They live all over Los Angeles
and all over North America.
They are
our target customer.
They hunt at night
when we're sleeping.
Hold on about
this hun?? hunting at night.
When I was a teenager, I lived
in the city of Carthage...
?[ Laughs ]
?Transylvania.
?Oh, God.
?...in Tunisia.
And they don't wait till night.
They come out at dusk.
?Dusk.
?And they blanket the sky.
Now, not every bat
eats mosquitos.
Some of them
enjoy blood.
?[ Laughs evilly ]
?They actually ??
?Your ?? Your, uh, family.
?Which is true.
And they actually
go hunt on mammals.
So, how do you know that
when you set up your BatBnB,
you're not getting
blood?sucking bats?
Our target markets are
in the United States,
Canada,
Europe, and Australia,
primarily in the U. S. A.
right now.
Uh, vampire bats, there are
two species of them.
They live only in South
and Central America.
How are you guys
bat specialists?
Like, what's
your background?
Um, so, we're not
bat specialists.
So, we started this
back in 2016.
All the headlines were
Zika, Zika, Zika.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you so much for
your offer, by the way.
[ Indistinct whispering ]
[ Chuckles ]
Ask him.
[ Laughs ]
Will you put on a Batman suit
if we ?? if we ??
[ Laughter ]
?Done.
?It's a deal.
?Oh, I didn't see that coming.
?I love it.
Nice to meet you guys.
?Appreciate it.
?That's a hell of
a great presentation.
?Oh, my God.
Very good.
Who more perfect
for a bat house?
?Kevin, turn into a bat!
?Thank you, everybody.
?[ Laughs ]
?Thank you.
And now we got Kevin on board
with all of his resources
and finances and the ??
and the investment?
Like, there's no place
we can't go.
Like, it's ??
it's fantastic.
You know, in the Mayan culture,
way back when,
bats started getting
a bad rap so far ago
because people
were scared of them.
Were you around during
the Mayan culture?
I first became close
with them in Tunisia.
?[ Laughs ]
?That's where it started.
Is that when you started
sleeping upside down?
Yes, when I
first met the bats.
I also met them in
Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.
At night, they would
cover the skies.
I would say to my father,
"What are those, Dad?"
And he'd say,
"Those are bats."
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
?"Those are our relatives!"
?And I always thought, one day,
I would be
in the bat business.
What's up, guys?
I'm Tom Armenti.
And I'm Kevin Gabauer, and we're
from Fort Collins, Colorado.
We're seeking
a $250,000 investment
for a 7.5% stake
in our company.
Sharks, picture
the perfect healthy meal ??
flakes of seaweed,
sautéed in coconut oil,
sprinkled
with chia seeds,
all resting on a bed
of crisp green kale.
?[ Chuckles ]
?At our restaurant,
we specialize in taking
this perfectly healthy meal...
...and throwing it
right in the trash!
[ Laughter ]
We're the Fat Shack.
[ Laughter ]
?Ahh.
?Ahh.
?Ohh.
?Oh, my God.
O'Leary: Oh, yeah.
Not only do we serve
your favorite foods ??
like French fries,
chicken fingers,
and mozzarella sticks ??
but we do it all
on one sandwich.
?No!
?Yes!
We're gonna start here
with your French fries
and your cheesesteak,
then we're gonna load it up
with some chicken fingers...
?Oh, oh...
...followed by some
mozzarella sticks on there...
?Oh, my God.
?...and then some onion rings.
Hm. It's still looking
a little bit light.
What do you think, Kev?
?Jalapeño poppers!
Of course!
We've got jalapeño poppers.
?Why not?
?Throw those jalapeño poppers,
and then we
finish it off
with tons and tons
of our ooey...
[ Laughter ]
...gooey sauce.
Now, we're gonna wrap
this thing up nice and tight
so we can serve it just
like a normal sandwich.
?Oh.
?Now, that is what we call..
the perfect meal.
?Now, Sharks, we have plenty
of other normal?people
food, as well ??
triple?stacked
cheeseburgers...
[ Cuban laughs ]
...deep?fried
funnel cake bites.
And the best part
is we're open as late
as 4:00 A. M.
We have seen huge success
with our concept,
and we're committed
to making our growth
even bigger
than our sandwiches.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to dig in
and join
the Fat Shack team?
?Got to try it.
?We got some samples ??
some kale salad
for you guys.
No. I'm just kidding
[ Laughter ]
?"Fat Shack."
?[ Chuckles ]
How did he get that sandwich
to look like that?
How many calories
in that sandwich?
Armenti: We have small ones that
range from, like, 700 to 800,
and then bigger ones
that get up to 2,000.
?That one's for you, Robert.
?Only 2,000?
2,000 calories.
A full day.
Thank you so much.
?For Mr. Wonderful.
?You have any forks?
?And then here's for you, Mark,
the Fat Jersey.
Herjavec: This is not a fork
kind of meal, Lori.
Greiner: Oh, my God, oh, my God.
What is in here?
?It is good, though.
?Mmm.
?What's in mine?
?Lori, you have the Fat Tommy.
That's French fries, chicken
fingers, lettuce, tomato,
pickles, and ketchup, mayo.
<i>?In</i> the sandwich?
?All on the sandwich, yes.
?On the sandwich.
?Robert, you have the Fat Slob.
?I feel the big one!
I feel the big one coming!
?That one's French fries,
chicken fingers,
cheesesteak,
mozzarella sticks,
ketchup, mayo.
Wow.
Mr. Wonderful,
the Fat Donkeylips.
[ Chuckles ] You got
French fries, chicken fingers,
lettuce, Buffalo,
and blue cheese.
Daymond, the Fat Chance.
?Oh, my God.
Cheesesteak,
jalapeño poppers,
chicken fingers,
French fries, Buffalo ranch.
And then, Mark,
the Fat Jersey ??
French fries,
cheesesteak,
mozzarella sticks...
?This is incredible.
...chicken fingers,
and house?made honey
mustard all on it.
I never thought it would
just taste that good, though.
That is nasty,
nasty, nasty good.
?[ Laughs ]
?I'm glad you like it.
?Wow.
?It's incredible.
Herjavec: Tom, how did you
come up with this?
Armenti: So, I'm actually
the founder of Fat Shack.
I started it back
in February of 2010.
Uh, Kevin and I know each other
going way back.
We went to college together.
But all throughout college,
I never had a job.
I've actually never really
had a job my whole life,
and I played online poker
through school
just to make money
and, you know...
?You're kidding.
?...support myself.
I just knew I needed
to do something different.
So, when I graduated
from school,
I found a local bagel shop
that was near the school.
And he closed his doors
at 3:00 P. M.,
and I was able to negotiate
a deal with him
where I would come in
and run my restaurant
using his equipment
from 6:00 at night
until 4:00 in the morning.
?Come on.
So I was able to open
the whole concept
back in Jersey for less ??
?The Fat is born.
[ Laughter ]
For less ??
Herjavec: I have never heard
of that kind of story.
Yeah, I was able to open
for less than $5,000,
so that's how it all started.
?Very smart.
You're a hustler.
And I have family
that lives in Colorado
where Colorado
State University ??
CSU ?? is. And that's when
I moved out to Colorado,
opened the first
full Fat Shack.
So, how many locations
do you guys have now?
Right now we have a total of 11
in 3 different states.
And these are all ??
You own these locations,
or are any of them franchised?
So, 9 of them are
franchisees of ours,
and then Tom and I
own two ??
two of the other stores.
?Wow.
So, tell us the numbers,
overall sales.
Cool. So, sales to date since
we started back in 2010
have been just over
$22 million.
?Whoa.
?What?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, we sold $22 million
of Fat Shack product...
?What about last year?
?...in the last eight years.
So ?? So last year,
we did about $5.7 million
in system?wide sales.
So, what's your franchise fee?
What's your advertising hit?
Yep. So, our franchise fee
is $18,000.
?Okay.
?And then we have a 6% royalty
that we take
every ?? every week.
And what about
advertising?
Uh, advertising,
as of right now,
we do not have one.
?Okay.
What are your revenues,
profits, et cetera?
So, basically,
any given store,
we have an average
revenue per year
is gonna be between
$40,000 and $45,000,
uh, that we'll get
from those royalties.
And of course, we'll have
the $18,000 up front.
Um, we did $300,000
last year,
and the profit on that
was just about $170,000.
This year, we'll do about
$425,000 to $450,000
in revenue just
with the franchising.
So, really, for us
to make our money back,
we got to open up
a lot of franchises.
For sure.
Yeah. And that's our plan.
How's your worst?performing
franchise doing?
They're still profitable,
our worst?performing store.
Like, in terms of revenue
and profitability.
In terms of revenue,
they'll probably
do about $500,000.
How much do they make
on the $500,000?
So, they'll probably make
about 10% on average
is what our profit margin is...
?$50,000.
...for the franchises
themselves.
Are they kids? Are they
university students?
Like, what's
the average ??
So, we've
specifically worked
with people
that are younger,
and a lot of them have actually
come up through our system.
So, over half
of our franchisees
started off working
for me directly...
?That's great.
?...as a delivery driver.
So, what does it cost
to open up a new unit?
So, we've opened most of
the units that we have right now
between $75,000 and
$100,000, start to finish.
?Do you fund it?
?So, there's a few that we have.
So, like Tom says, if there's
an employee that we have
that started out
as a delivery driver,
worked their way up
the ladder,
we have funded a few of
those stores, um, for them.
So, you're only offering 7.5%
of basically $140,000 after tax
you can distribute.
Think about me as an investor.
I could take the $250,000,
put it into a REIT,
making me 9% that has
tremendous distribution
or give it to you
with the risk
that you somehow
stumble on the rollout.
So ??
It's not that attractive.
You're not ??
Yeah, so, right now,
we have five stores
that are basically
ready to go.
A couple of the guys,
you know, are waiting ??
are waiting
for funding from us.
But isn't it more efficient
for you guys
to get multi?unit
operators?
?For sure.
?It definitely helps, yeah.
I mean ?? So, is the plan just
to, like, grow organically
and, you know,
enable your employees,
or are you looking for
somebody to come along and say,
"I'll open 10 units"?
So, our growth strategy
isn't all just employees.
It definitely is finding people
from the outside, as well.
But right now, we are looking
for those owner/operators.
We want to find
those grinders
that were like myself
in the very beginning.
You guys are incredible. I mean,
your whole story is amazing.
But there isn't
that much money in it.
I mean,
I get the $22 million.
But we're talking about
$150,000 after tax.
So, when we get these
next five stores open,
that will bring us up
to about $700,000 in revenue
and about
a $400,000 profit.
I give you
$250,000, 7.5%,
I'm getting about
30 grand a year.
I'm assuming
you're doing a distribution.
?Yeah, definitely.
?So I'm getting 30 grand,
which is 12% interest
on my $250,000.
It's interesting,
but, you know,
you don't get to be a Shark by
making interest along the way.
?Yeah, for sure.
?How do I get that $250,000
to be $2 million?
Is it just more locations?
Yeah. Our goal is
to increase, you know,
the footprint across
the country.
We've definitely
proven the model.
But we're building this
into a corporation
that will be here
for the next 60 years.
I have no intention of
going anywhere with this.
Look. I'll make you
an offer commensurate
with my perception
of your risk, okay?
?Uh, oh.
?My perception of your risk.
?Let's hear it.
?Here's his blood?sucking offer.
Right now, I don't hear
any other offers, so...
?[ Laughs ]
?...I'd be smiling and saying,
"Thank you, Mr. Wonderful,
for making any offer."
There's a smile.
[ Laughter ]
I'll give you
the $250,000.
I want 25%.
Wow.
You know, don't bite
the hand that feeds you.
Tom and Kevin have an offer
on the table from Kevin O'Leary
for their decadent fast?food
business, Fat Shack.
I'll give you the $250,000.
I want 25%.
I think Kevin was
looking at my notes.
I have the same offer ??
$250,000 for 25%.
Appreciate that.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you, Daymond.
We appreciate the offer.
Herjavec: Why are you taking
any of the distribution out?
That's how the franchise
model works, Robert.
No, no, I know.
But at this point,
wouldn't it be better just
to leave the money in there
for a number of years
and grow it?
So, and that's what
we've essentially done,
is Kevin and I have
only really pulled out
what we need to ??
But going forward, you're
gonna start distributing it.
Going forward, if you guys
agree to a 7.5%,
we're happy to pay
your distribution out
every single year.
?It doesn't work at 7.5%.
You're giving me less ??
?I understand, I understand.
I'm just saying, we're happy
to pay that distribution out,
and we're happy
to keep grinding it out...
For sure.
...and putting our money
back into people.
You know, I think you have
other Sharks interested,
and I don't feel strong
enough about it to compete.
So I'm out.
We appreciate it,
yeah.
Kevin, I?I like it.
Here's my offer on it.
There's no need
for you in this, Robert.
?[ Laughs ]
?I really, really like it.
But you can't give up 25%.
?No.
?Correct.
I mean, that sucks
the life out of you.
Let's hear the offer.
?Like, why would you do that?
?Right.
?I'll give you $250,000 for...
17%.
?We appreciate that offer.
?Um...
I don't want to take
any money out, though.
?That's crazy. That's crazy.
?Like, I don't want to take
any distribution until
we get to a certain point.
For me, there's no point in
taking out distribution
for the next five years.
?Yeah.
Like, what? What, am I gonna get
interest on my $250,000?
We appreciate
you seeing that angle.
Let's go.
Cuban: The business side
of me says
you're hitting
every line item, right?
What I can't
get past is,
just the whole
health thing, right?
Every other
food product I have
is geared towards
healthy living.
Herjavec: This is why
you need to balance ??
Well, it's time
to mix up the portfolio.
Gabauer:
Yeah, let's get a little bit
of diversification.
You know, we don't eat Fat Shack
every single day, obviously.
It's a cheat meal
for people...
Yeah, you guys
are in good shape.
...to come in and
get something really good.
Thank you.
And knowing that we can make
our good money on that?
It really is
an awesome concept...
Herjavec: What are you
gonna do, Mark?
...and customers
just go nuts for it.
O'Leary:
You in or out?
All right,
I'll offer you 250K,
but I want the 17%
that Robert's offering,
and the reason
is that much,
because it's ??
it's a slow burn.
And the real home run in all
this isn't the franchise fee.
?So it's an exit, right?
?Yeah.
And the challenge is that
it's gonna take a lot of years.
That's the ?? the catch?22.
There's got to be enough upside
for all that I'd be investing.
John: I'll bring mine down
to 17%, as well.
Greiner: Wow.
Okay, guys.
?We would do a deal ??
We would do a deal at 12%.
?Oh, that's not exciting.
?It's not enough.
?Okay, guys. It's decision time.
[ Indistinct whispering ]
Yeah, we could
do that. Yeah,
So...
Mark, would you
be willing to do
$250,000 for 15%
of the company?
Armenti: So, I started
this company for under $5,000
running out of a garage
and countless of hours
in the kitchen.
And then here we are now
with this deal with Mark Cuban.
So all these 8 years of grinding
it out has truly paid off.
