Greetings, Sharks.
I'm Rener Gracie,
and I'm seeking
a $500,000 investment
in exchange for
a 5% equity stake
in my apparel company Quikflip.
Ooh.
It was a cold
December morning...
[ Chuckles ]
...and my son wanted
to go to the park.
So I threw on
my favorite hoodie,
and off we went.
After about 30 minutes
of chasing this guy
around the park, the sun began
peeking through the clouds,
and I started to sweat.
At that point,
I had no choice
but to take off my hoodie.
You can probably guess
what my options were.
We have the fanny pack.
?[ Chuckles ]
?We have the...
European yacht club.
?[ Laughs ]
?I see you, Robert.
?What?
?And then we have the ??
And then we have
the wannabe cool guy.
This is the option
I stuck with.
But when I finally caught up
to Little Man,
I bent over to pick him up,
and the hoodie
slipped off my shoulder
onto the wet grass.
?Oh, no!
?Ohh!
There has to be a better way!
?Sharks, Sharks,
that was it!
Quikflip was born.
Check this out.
Flip it,
tuck it,
shake it,
and voilà.
In a matter of seconds...
Greiner: No!
...using our proprietary
conversion technology...
[ Laughter ]
...we can turn any
outwear garment
into a fully functional
backpack in a flash.
With our slide?and?bite
technology,
you can adjust the pack
to keep it safe and secure
during literally
any activity.
Even jujitsu
with your brother.
[ Grunts ]
[ Laughter ]
But wait. There's more!
[ Laughter ]
You can store anything you want
inside the backpack.
And when
the temperature drops,
simply reach in,
take out your stuff,
with one hand ??
Sharks, count to 3.
All: 1, 2 ??
Too late.
We're already back
to full hoodie functionality...
[ Laughter ]
...in a matter of seconds.
Do you want to us leave?
We can step out
of the room for you.
No, no, no, no.
All I need are my black?belt
business partners
to help me
submit the ?? uh ??
...to help me submit
the outwear industry
and flip your investments
into black?belt profits.
Who's with me?
?[ Laughs ]
?Wow.
?That was exhausting.
?And my brother, Ryron Gracie.
Thanks for being here, brother.
We'll see you soon.
?Bye, brother.
?Rener, can we see it?
?Now you can see your samples.
?[ Laughs ] Thank you.
?Ahh.
?Mark, you're right here.
?Yes, sir. Appreciate it, Rener.
?Thank you.
?Check it out, you guys.
?Thank you.
?No worries.
?Thank you.
?Thank you very much.
?Very nice.
Everyone stand up,
please.
It's a conversion race.
Put your stuff down.
So, here's the deal, guys.
All you do is you reach in,
grab the entire hoodie,
and pull it through,
and then just start
shoving the rest of it
on the inside.
Yes, reach in,
grab, and pull.
Everything,
you just grab and pull.
And then tuck it through
the inside, and then ??
?Bah?bam!
?Winner. Winner over there!
?Yes!
?I'm last.
?Look at that.
So, you flip it on,
and then you grab the rope,
and you literally slide
and bite at any height.
?[ Laughs ]
?Look, look, look. Look, look.
?Ohh.
?Slide and bite at any height.
Slide it up to any height.
And to loosen it, watch,
you just do this. Lookit.
Whoop. It comes right off.
?Is this your first product?
?Yeah. Have a seat, you guys.
Let's talk.
[ Laughter ]
So, here's the deal.
Tell us about you,
your background.
My grandfather, to kind of
give you a starting point,
was the co?creator
of the art
of Brazilian jujitsu,
the now famous
all over the world,
fast?growing martial art.
My father came to America
and started teaching
out of his garage in 1978.
It was my uncle Royce,
my dad's brother,
who went in UFC ??
the early UFCs...
Oh. Right.
...went in there and beat these
giants, put us on the map.
And so the clothing brand
also came into fruition,
and we're selling T?shirts,
hoodies, uniforms,
and martial?arts apparel.
So we learned a lot of things
during this scaling of jujitsu.
A supply chain was
a critical factor there.
It's been incredibly helpful
to have those, too.
And what does
one of these cost?
We make them
for between $13 and $15.
We sell them for
between $40 and $50.
And how are you
selling them?
All of this has been
directly online.
We did, like, a pilot test.
We ordered 5,000 units,
put it out,
see how the people are gonna
respond to this.
And then, in 2 1/2 months,
we sold out.
So you sold $200,000 worth,
give or take?
Yeah, give or take.
But we started losing ??
we started selling out
of our top SKUs,
like, within, you know, 60 days.
?Okay, Rener, I get all that.
I want to hear
about sales now.
Are you always this
passionate and excited?
So, just real quick, it went
from a hoodie ?? from a product,
as we, you know ?? and I said ??
?We know this already.
So then, my wife's
mother says,
"Rener, I don't
wear hooded garments."
Guess what we came out with.
Convertible crew necks,
fully convertible.
Then parents called in and said,
"Hey, my kids always tell me
to carry their stuff."
Wait, wait.
Turn the crew neck around.
?Yeah.
Oh, you have an entire
product line.
You guys,
this is not a product.
[ Singsong voice ]
It's a company.
We're here
to talk business.
[ Laughter ]
Isn't that
what you guys like?
I've watched enough episodes.
?Okay, so...
So, hold on.
I went to Disneyland, you guys,
and I saw
one dad carrying
six hoodies, jackets,
sweaters...
Oh, no.
...for all his daughters,
and I was like,
"No! This doesn't need
to be the case, you guys."
So...
So then we came out with
kids' variations, as well.
And then Costa Rica,
Hawaii, Miami,
and Seattle called.
And guess what they wanted.
Waterproof, you know, outerwear,
a little more durable.
We came up with the first
dry?flip technology.
?Rener, I got a ?? I got a...
?I got to see this!
?Daymond, I got to see this.
?Look at this ??
the first dry?flip technology.
You guys, you're out there,
it's raining.
?Full dry?flip technology.
?Rener, Rener, I got a question.
Yes, sir?
Will we be able to talk
at all during the pitch?
?Yes.
?I'm just trying to get there.
Rener,
$500,000 for 5% ??
[ Laughter ]
Rener,
it's gonna end badly
if you don't give me
some numbers.
So, here's the deal.
We did a little pilot launch.
It was great.
We sold out in 40 days
in the middle of the summer.
We do $279,000.
?Got it.
?And then in August alone,
we did $205,000 in sales.
?So your total sales, $500,000.
?Yeah, $577,000.
?What did you make on that?
?$220,000 profit, 38%,
all online,
direct to consumer.
Is there any way
that you can justify
the $10 million valuation
with $500,000 in sales?
I'm glad you guys asked.
So, the way
I look at Quikflip
is a potential
four?legged monster.
Leg one ?? direct to consumer,
which we love.
Step two ?? the promotional
products industry.
Step three is gonna be
the licensing
of the technology...
?Okay.
?...to apparel companies.
And step four ??
potentially retail.
I'm not dead?set on it,
but with your guys' expertise...
Rener, do you have a propri??
Is this proprietary?
Yes.
So, we have four patents ??
uh, two utility
and two design patents
pending
domestically
and internationally.
Daymond, will he get
a patent for this?
He can, but I've had 50 patents
that I cannot protect
and/or they'll go around
and get a knock?off.
So is your point
he can get patents, someone
will knock it off anyway?
Yeah. You know what?
And the reality is ??
They will, and then you'll
just have to fight it,
which is expensive.
?Yeah. We can speculate all day,
but one thing is for sure.
We can ?? We can do a deal,
if we do one on the ??
on the protection of the patent
and the intellectual property
being issued.
Rener, you're ?? you're
crushing it right now.
Why do you need money?
?The way we've been growing,
the inventory purchased,
uh, volume
has doubled every time
we've ordered.
Okay, so, here's my first
thought, Rener.
Yes.
I would just take
a backpack with me.
If this were the case, Mark ??
I appreciate that.
I think if this were
the case for everybody,
I wouldn't have went
to Disneyland and saw
60 hoodies in a period of three
hours tied around people ??
Rener, Rener,
it's not a question of whether
or not it's valid, right?
It is.
Your sales prove it.
I just don't see the connection
that we would create
or even any of
the Sharks, right?
'Cause you drive it
yourself.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
You know, I think it's great
what you're doing.
But a lot of these roads are not
gonna be successful for you,
and when you
send it to retail,
they can't tell what it is.
It's just another hoodie.
And the valuation
is way too high
for me to take
that road with you.
So I'm out.
Thank you. Um...
Rener, everybody agrees the
product probably has a market,
and you're a force of nature,
no question.
You're asking me
to pay 20 times sales.
Forget about profits.
That's crazy.
Classic deal where you
ask for too much money
at too early a time.
500K for this? You'd have
to have 50%, maybe more.
I'm out.
The power of this brand
is really ??
it's a great idea, but it's you.
I mean, you are killing it.
You are the brand.
I want to be
in business with you.
But I give you $500,000,
just ?? what do I ??
?Let me just ??
?Do I ?? Do I submit you to 10%?
That's, you know, definitely
a conversation we can ??
Absolutely.
I'm here to talk,
and I would love
to have a partner.
Like, I just ?? I can't
structure the deal.
Is 10% good?
Now, let me just say about
our projections, Robert,
real quick, before you answer ??
Uh, so, this year,
we're on set to do $1.2 million
before the end of the year.
Next year, we're estimated
to do $5.5 million.
The $500,000
is the problem.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll come back in.
Hear me on this.
Sure.
I'm structuring it.
I'll give you
$100,000 for 25%
and $400,000
as a line of credit.
?[ Laughs ]
?It's just debt.
So, half of his profits
for a quarter of his company.
Rener has offers from Kevin
and Robert
for his convertible apparel
company Quikflip,
but Lori may be interested.
I think what's right
for me here...
Instead ?? Instead of
pushing for the patents ??
Rener, my offer...
?I don't put a lot of weight ??
?...might disappear.
I'll do the deal
for the 15% without...
But you need
to take my offer now.
...the contingencies
of patents.
I don't care
about your patents.
Lori, I have
a question for you.
If we went around the 10% mark,
but in your investment,
we did maybe
$300,000, uh, cash
and we did
$200,000 in a line of credit,
we're getting closer
to where I'm ??
You said $300,000 ??
$200,000 in
a line of credit...
Yeah. So, I'm willing
to split that up
so that you're not giving me
so much cash out the gate.
And $300,000 in cash.
?Maybe $250,000 and $250,000.
?But you want 10%,
but you're saying ??
?So, 10% equity ??
10% equity
is where I'm at.
$250,000 and $250,000
and I'll do it.
Greiner:
Very good man.
Rener, Rener,
you made an offer.
She said yes to it.
?Yeah, I like that.
Yeah, I like it.
I love it.
And, um, would you
be interested in having
someone else with you on
the deal at all...
No.
...or jumping in?
No. No need.
?Congratulations, Rener.
?Thank you so much, you guys.
Have a good one.
Whoo!
I went out there,
I turned on the "Renergy,"
and once I do,
there's no stopping it.
You can't turn it off.
They couldn't get a word in.
But they told me to own
the stage, and guess what I did.
That guy was
a ball of fire, man.
Force of nature.
Now that he's gone, we can
finally talk to each other.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
Narrator:
This season, we celebrated
10 years of "Shark Tank"...
[ Cork pops, cheering ]
There's only
one thing left to do.
...and our entrepreneurs
continue
to achieve their dreams.
Esnard: As an immigrant
from a developing country,
St. Lucia,
not having the opportunity
and just seeing
your product looking at you.
I love Daymond for that,
and thank you, "Shark Tank."
My dad
never gave up hope.
He fought so hard and kept
believing in miracles.
Kaley:
To be able to continue our dad's
dream is absolutely incredible
and to just share our story with
more people all over the world.
Welcome
to Tipsy Elves.
The Tipsy Elves story could only
happen in America.
We're two guys who quit
our successful careers
who now come into work
every day
designing amazing products
and putting smiles
on people's faces.
We just hit
$15 million in sales.
Carvana has just acquired
Car360 for $22 million.
We've just been acquired
for $34 million.
We've done over
$50 million in sales.
Isn't it amazing?
Martin:
Being a part of "Shark Tank"
is my "happily ever after."
I hope that it gives
inspiration to other moms
when they have a good idea
to go for it.
Narrator: And one entrepreneur
achieved the ultimate dream ??
by becoming a Shark.
Siminoff:
"Shark Tank" is not just a show.
Kids are growing up, seeing what
entrepreneurs can do,
what inventors can do, and how
you can build your own destiny.
Narrator:
And we were inspired by other
exciting new guest Sharks.
Webb:
I feel like women and moms make
great business owners
because we're multi?taskers.
I mean, women can handle a lot.
Hey!
Higgins: The entrepreneurs
who go on "Shark Tank,"
they're trying
to make it and transcend.
I relate to that. I feel like my
whole life has been about that.
Barkley: Entrepreneurship
is really important
because you give people power,
and I love when I give them
that power where they can
control their own destiny.
Narrator:
We strove to make a difference.
I think we need more women
wanting businesses,
and I think that starts
with each of you.
We'll be donating a portion of
proceeds to Dress for Success.
Woman: We all have been
struggling, broke,
and I want to show women,
you can achieve the impossible.
Houdashell:
We would like to donate $50,000
today to Make?A?Wish.
McGill:
Lori's deal was special because
she offered an opportunity
to give back ?? a dollar
from each unit sold
to be given to a children's
charity of our choice.
My mission is
to make our military
the most efficient force
in the world.
It's amazing what kind of
innovation can come
while serving your country.
Now I have a thriving company
that's being backed by
the United States Air Force.
Narrator:
As we look towards the future...
[ Cheering ]
...we hope to continue
to inspire every generation
for decades to come.
Cuban:
The beauty of "Shark Tank"
is that anybody
can start a company.
Doesn't matter
where you grew up.
Doesn't really even matter
what kind of business.
It could be big or be small.
But you have a chance
to be on "Shark Tank,"
and who knows
what can happen from there?
All you have to do
is take that first step,
and anything is possible.
