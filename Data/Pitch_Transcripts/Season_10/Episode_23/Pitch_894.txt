Hey, Sharks.
My name is Chris Rannefors.
And I'm
Harrison Broadhurst.
We're from
Lexington, Kentucky.
We're seeking
$100,000 for 16% of our company.
So, we have a problem.
With our winters
getting shorter and warmer,
insects like mosquitos
are coming out earlier
and in greater numbers,
bringing Zika and other
deadly diseases in their wake.
It seems like the only solutions
available on the marketplace
are expensive pesticides that
burn and irritate our skin
while also endangering
local wildlife.
And all of this while there's
been a perfect natural solution
that we never think of.
Both: Bats!
[ Gasps ]
So, most people don't know
that a common bat
will eat up to 1,000
mosquito?sized insects
an hour...
?What?
...making them one of
nature's greatest forms
of natural
pest control.
So how do we enlist
these amazing animals
to support our cause?
Introducing BatBnB.
?Ta?da!
?That's right.
BnB as in a bed
and breakfast for bats.
[ Chuckles ]
Now, with our line
of designer bat houses,
you can
significantly reduce
your backyard
pest population.
Every BatBnB
is designed with
the animal's unique
lifestyle in mind,
with interior groove chambers
and landing pads
that allow the bat to easily
grip, climb, and hang.
And Harrison and I were like,
"Oh, gosh, we want to have kids,
but we can't be
near Zika mosquitos."
And it was scary,
and we felt helpless.
So we looked at the market,
and like we said,
it's all pesticides,
and harmful pesticides.
So we drew on a childhood
experience I had
where I actually grew up
building bat houses
with my father.
Um, and we looked at ??
You grew up building bat houses
with your father?
?How did that come on?
?How does that start?
Uh, my dad's
a big conservationist.
He's into animals.
?There you go.
How many bats
could live in there?
Um, so, 80 to 100 bats
can fit in there.
?Whoa!
?80 to 100?!
I mean, you see ?? you see
how little, uh, Radar is, here.
?So they like to be close?
?Yeah.
Herjavec: But, Chris,
people don't like bats.
Like, it freaks
most people out.
How do you sell this to people
and educate them?
So, you're absolutely right,
Robert.
So, ever since Bram Stoker
wrote "Dracula,"
like, over 100 years ago,
bats had to suffer
from the big, bad wolves.
?They're scary?looking, though?
O'Leary: It's as far back
as Greek mythology.
They were considered
to live in Hades.
Persephone
was very involved.
Also, in Rome, it was ?? If you
didn't want to go to sleep,
you cut
the head off a bat
and put it in a bag
by your left arm.
?Yeah.
?[ Laughs ]
It goes
further back.
Yes.
I am one with the bat.
Yes, I know.
They're your relatives.
No, no.
I just understand them.
So, tell us
about your business.
So, we launched via crowdfunding
about 11 months ago.
So far, our revenues to date
have been $135,000.
And what are you projecting
sales will be for this year?
So, sales for this year,
we're looking at
$145,000 this year.
Chris, how big
is this market?
So, while we've been growing
on the consumer side,
where we see the high growth
in this market,
uh, is in the public
sector.
So, if you look at the public
sector, on the county level,
there are enormous budgets
for mosquito and pest control.
What does it cost you
to make it?
Yeah, it costs $88.50
for us to make it.
It costs $239
with shipping.
Herjavec: Wow.
Harrison, Chris,
I see it as a hobby market.
It's relatively small.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
Appreciate that.
Cuban: How do you get, um,
a city, county, state ??
whatever it may be ??
how do you get to them?
Yeah, so that?? that's part
of ?? That's one tier
of what we would do
with an investment.
We'd pursue relationships,
and we would work with people
who have experience in ??
So, let's just say
that goes perfectly.
Where do
your sales go?
So, we've done
a five?year forecast,
and in Year 5, we'll be
a $1 million?a?year business.
Honestly, I just don't see
that being big enough,
right, for the amount of time
and work that's involved.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
John: I have a lot of bats
on my property.
It hasn't really reduced,
as far as I know, uh,
much of
the mosquito issue.
I still feel like
I have a mosquito problem
or a bug problem,
and I just don't think
that people understand the value
of what you're doing.
And I just think it's a hard way
to educate people.
So, with that, I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
And then
there were two.
Rannefors:
Two years ago, when we first
started this, it was a little ??
a little hobby thing
that Harrison and I did
in our ??
in our free time.
