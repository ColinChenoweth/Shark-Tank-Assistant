Hello, Sharks.
My name is Paul Mott,
and this is
my lovely wife, Pamela.
Hello, Sharks.
We're here from
San Diego, California,
seeking $250,000
for 10% of our company.
Now, Sharks, we all know there
are plenty of dog lovers
in the world, and it's easy
to understand why.
Because they bring so much
happiness to our lives.
But imagine you're out
with your sweet little dog
on a beautiful day,
and suddenly,
danger appears.
And before
you can do anything,
your dog
is gone forever.
That happened to us,
and I hate to say it,
it happens
all the time.
There are
so many coyotes,
aggressive dogs...
?Oh.
?Wow.
?...and even birds of prey...
...that just want to take
our fur babies away.
We came up with a solution.
And we call it
CoyoteVest Pet Body Armor.
Come on, guys.
?Oh! [ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
Scooter!
Come on.
All right.
[ Laughter ]
?Come here, puppy!
?Watch out!
?That's Scooter.
?You're a dog lover.
?Aww. Look at him!
?The stab?resistant body armor
can slow down or prevent
a surprise attack
at any
given moment.
People love
CoyoteVest.
So, Pamela, you had a puppy
that was snatched by a coyote?
Pamela: Yes, we did.
Her name was Buffy.
?So what happened?
?What happened to Buffy?
Herjavec: Like, you were
just walking along?
Paul: We were actually
at our local dog park,
and I heard a yelp,
and I turned around,
and I saw Buffy in
the jaws of a coyote...
?Wow.
?What?!
...being carried away
at full speed
up a hill
into heavy brush.
So I understand
the spikes here.
And these are,
like, metal spikes.
I mean, if something were
to bite into this,
it would puncture through
the roof of their mouth.
What happens is,
the moment the attacker
feels that sharp spike
against their mouth,
they just stop.
?They stop.
The attack's over.
These coyote whiskers
are probably the most important
invention you see right here,
because what they do
is they introduce doubt
into the mind
of a predator.
Ahh.
The predator doesn't
know if these are
razor?sharp,
poison?tipped.
All he knows is, this does not
look like an easy meal.
What are your sales?
Since we started this company
2 1/2 years ago,
we've sold $570,000.
What have you sold
year?to?date this year?
Uh, this year, to date,
we've sold $260,000.
How do you sell it?
We sell directly
through our website.
What do you sell them for?
What do you make them for?
?[ Dog whines ]
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Imitating dog yowling ]
?We sell this kit,
as you see it,
for $120.
?Ooh.
?And it costs us $30 to make.
Cuban: Where do you make them?
How do you make them?
We make them right here
in the United States.
Good.
We actually have, uh,
set up our own
little miniature factory
to make these.
We've had to overcome quite
a few hurdles in our production.
You would think that people
would see this and say,
you know, "What is that?
I want one."
It's not blowing up because
people are saying...
[ Dog barks ]
..."Oh, it's for
a coyote attack only."
It's kind of for a very
specific niche?y market.
But this is used for
more than just coyotes.
You could meet up with a dog,
and all of a sudden...
It's aggressive, yeah.
...and this even
happened to us,
they just
go for your dog.
What you need is
some batteries on this thing
so they light up and
you get an electric shock
when you bite it.
That's a great idea,
Mr. Wonderful.
?Really?
?What?
?Let's see what we got.
?He has a remote.
Well, we're gonna let somebody
come up and try it.
Scooter, hush.
?Oh, I'll try it.
?Yeah.
This is called
the CoyoteZapper...
[ Dog barks ]
...and it would've
saved Buffy's life.
Paul: So, just touch
a little bit there.
Grr.
Lightly, lightly.
Lightly, with
your fingertips.
[ High?pitched ] Aah!
[ Laughter ]
Geez!
?Was it bad?
Robert, can your screams
get any more high?pitched?
[ Laughter ]
So, I'm interested, but my ?? my
biggest concern is the factory.
Is your idea to operate
this factory yourself
or get to a point to scale
to get other factory
to do it, license it?
Where are you
with the factory?
Well, the only reason
we created a factory
is so that we could get
this company started
and make it through
the first couple of years.
Two challenges ?? one Daymond
mentioned, and that's scaling.
?We do have a manufacturer now.
?We're ready to scale.
We are ready to scale.
Right, I know ??
I know you're ready to,
but you haven't gone through
those problems yet.
And the second issue
is young children.
It's gonna be
a challenge for families
and the risk
that's involved there.
It's gonna take a lot
of hand?holding
and personal attention
that I don't think
I'm quite
the right person to do.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary: The problem is,
this is a small business,
and at $250,000 for 10%
is a $2.5 million valuation.
That ??
?This is patented, by the way.
Yeah, I get it.
But you actually
don't make any money yet,
even if you had $500,000,
'cause you have
to pay yourself something.
There's not a lot of room
for me as an investor.
It's not for me, guys.
I'm out.
?Oh.
?All right, well...
Paul: We're definitely gonna
keep moving forward
with this business.
There's a lot of dogs
out there in the world
that will need this product,
and we really want
to save their lives
as much as we can.
