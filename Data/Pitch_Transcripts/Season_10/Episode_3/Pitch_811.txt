Hi, my name is Sara Polon,
and I am the CEO
and co?founder
of Soupergirl.
And I'm
Marilyn Polon,
Sara's mom, CAO ??
Chief Anxiety Officer.
[ Laughter ]
We're here
from Washington, D. C.,
and we're asking
for $500,000
for 10% of our company.
?Oh.
?Wow.
Sharks,
as most of you know,
most commercially
available soup
is not as healthy
as you might think.
I mean, why do need a PhD
to read the ingredient list?
I mean, really, Sara,
what is gwe?ar gum...
What?
...monosodium glutamate...
Huh?
...and mechanically
separated chicken?
I don't even know.
I don't even know.
[ Grumbling ]
Okay, at Soupergirl,
we have cracked the code
to the perfect soups.
Our soups are all?natural,
they are hand?crafted,
brimming in plant?based
protein and fiber,
and really, really low
in salt and fat,
and they're bursting
in fresh vegetables.
Mmm.
Everything your doctor says
you should be eating,
and the soups
are delicious.
Yeah.
The proof is in the numbers ??
<i>my</i> numbers!
My cholesterol
used to be 220,
and now it's
170 and dropping.
Good for you.
Sharks, what started off
as a small,
local,
soup?delivery business
has organically grown
into something much bigger,
and now it's time
for the rest of the country
to be eating our soups.
[ Laughter ]
Um, Sara wanted to st??
?Go ahead, Bubbe.
?By definition, yep.
?She's a great bubbe.
?I can tell.
I think the problem started
when we launched
and I found
our first kitchen.
She said to me, "Ma,
I got this great kitchen
we're gonna cook in."
It was a dungeon,
literally a dungeon.
You had to go downstairs.
There was no air?conditioning
in the summer.
We were shvitzing
in the winter.
?She was shvitzing.
?You were shvitzing? Shvitzing?
There was no heat!
I heard a squeak, squeak!
It was a mouse!
And I said,
"I am out of here."
?Oh, no!
No, no, put it in the soup!
It's protein!
?Ohh. We're plant?based.
?No, they're gonna get to that.
So, I said ?? I said,
"Sara, I am out of here."
She said, "No, you're not.
You're staying,"
and I stayed,
because Sara is so determined.
And so I stayed.
I've been here for 10 years.
But, um ??
?Congratulations.
The product is really good,
so you passed the first test.
?Thank you. Thank you.
?However...
Yes.
...now we get down
to the numbers,
and quickly, I must say,
$500,000 for 10%
imputes a $5 million
business.
Oy.
?Oy!
?Yes.
?Okay?
Sara, honey, sweetie, poopsie,
those are terrible margins.
You're grow?? Look, you can't be
growing that fast.
We hit our capacity,
and I had to make
a decision.
Am I gonna stay where
we are as a small,
local?D. C. business...
Get a copacker!
...or...
I'll tell you why
we can't get a copa??
Or are we going to take this
nationwide?
And here's how we're very
quickly going nationwide.
Meet the Souper Meals
Program.
Okay? What we do is...
Oh.
...we deliver three?day
or five?day programs.
So, the three?day
has 12 soups,
and the five?day
has 20 soups.
Ohh.
So heavy!
People eat soup
all day every day?
Well, or ?? or you can
customize the program.
You have this program
running?
We've run it
on a small level.
We've done about
$900,000 in sales.
I know that model.
I ship stuff in jars
all across the country.
I know you do.
Well, let me tell you
what it costs.
How much?
For the three?day program,
it costs $50 to make
and we sell it for $99,
and that includes shipping.
That's <i>not</i>
a good margin.
Here's the tragedy
about to happen.
Let her finish.
Let her finish.
Let me get
the numbers out.
You made $120,000,
a 5%, okay, on the $2.4 million.
Yeah.
You priced the business
at a $5 million valuation.
Sara, that's a 41 multiple
on a soup business!
No soup for you!
[ Laughter ]
Sara, on the planet Earth,
during the planet's history,
has anybody ever paid
41 times for soup?
How do you know that?
I know that
because I know everything.
Okay, so ??
And there's no way you're gonna
get that in here today.
Here's the ?? Here's the ??
Here's the thing...
Do you believe
that you're gonna, um,
net more...
Take over the ??
...and increase more
than 5% for your net?
Oh, yes.
My fixed costs
are quite high
because of
this new kitchen.
Well, that goes back
to the copacker.
You were gonna say why didn't
want to use a copacker.
Right, okay,
so there's two reasons why we
don't want to use a copacker.
Number one, we're certified
Kosher, and you will not find ??
?There are Kosher copackers.
?There are Kosher copackers.
Not that can do this quality.
Trust me, we've talked to them.
So, Sara, you ?? you won't let
your baby go...
But the reason ?? the reason ??
...because you think
you're the only person
that can make this quality...
Yes.
...and that's
costing you 5% to 6%.
Soup is horrible when they're
cooked in that quantity.
But they'll adjust for you if,
you know, if ??
They'll let you be there
as they put in
those giant colanders.
But they're
doing it wrong.
Nobody does this.
Nobody does
what you're trying to do.
Exactly!
Do you have any, uh,
loans or debt?
Yes, I have $640,000 in
a small business loan
that I'm paying down.
Cuban: You see what's
happening here, right?
You keep on needing cash.
Yes.
And you're hoping that
you'll make it up in volume.
You have retail stores and
you have subscription, right?
When I see somebody going after
that many outlets,
that means they're not
completely confident in any <i>one.</i>
[ Stammers ]
Higgins: Wait, Sara.
I want ?? I want to hear
a little bit about how you're
gonna use that $500,000.
Let's set aside the fact
that your valuation
is ridiculously high.
The website that
we're building ??
Everything
that we've learned
from, uh, our
Souper Meals program
that we've done
over the past year,
we're gonna integrate it
into that website.
So, auto?renewal, subscriptions,
refer?? automated referrals.
It already exists.
You don't need to develop that.
And how much do you
think you're gonna have
to pay to get that done?
Yeah.
?About $100,000.
?No.
?That's about right.
That's about right.
And then I want $400,000
for equipment,
to optimize my staff costs.
I mean, I need to bring
down my staff costs.
Y?You're buying more equipment?
But how's that gonna now ??
How's that gonna show up
in top?line and bottom?line?
Oh, sure, because my staff costs
are going to come down.
I ?? My staff costs
are still too high.
Sara, you are literally at risk
of going out of business...
...and I don't think you realize
and know it.
Sara, you are literally at risk
of going out of business...
...and I don't think you realize
and know it.
You see what's
happening here, right?
You keep on needing cash.
You are so
capital?intensive, right?
Yes.
Perfection is the enemy
of profitability.
I'm out.
I appreciate
all your feedback.
?You're welcome.
?Gave me a lot to think about.
O'Leary: So how much cash do
you have in the bank right now?
Mm, about $20,000.
?Ohh!
?Whoa.
?Well, that's okay.
Wait, but no ?? But in accounts
receivable, I have ??
No, it's not okay.
You have to service right now
$640,000 of debt.
The business is worth
about $750,000 right now,
less the debt.
So it's worth about $100,000
and, you know, change.
That's the truth.
That's what a buyer
would give you for it.
I'm out.
You would have to do
$100 million
to make $5 million.
I would get 10% of that.
You would have to do
$100 million
just for me to get back
$500,000.
I mean, think about that.
For that reason, I'm out.
Higgins:
Sara, first of all,
I think we're being way too dire
about your business.
No.
Sara: The soups
need to be perfect.
A Soupermom and Soupergirl
stand behind
every unit of soup
that goes out the door,
and that's never gonna change.
I don't ??
Seriously, she's in trouble.
No, but entrepreneurs
do that all the time.
The soup was really good.
Perfection, perfection. Only I
can do it. Only I can do it.
You know what this was?
This was dead soup boiling.
