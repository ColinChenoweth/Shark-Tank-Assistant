Now, I love the soup,
but you better sell
a lot of it.
So give me the sales.
?Well, let's talk about 2016 ??
$1.4 million.
?Whoa!
?Sales in 2017 ??
$2.4 million.
There you go.
Whoa!
We're on track to do
$3.4 million. We started off ??
?Okay, how are you doing that?
?Wow.
?How are you doing that?
?Very good. Impressive.
We started off as a
small, local, delivery
business ?? Thank you ??
and now we have two retail
locations.
We're in almost 50
natural?food locations
and 20 box stores.
The consumer demand for this
product is exploding, and ??
What did you make last year
on that $2.4 million?
How much did you make?
Oh, about 5%.
Ouch!
I'll tell you why.
Because in 2000 ??
Hi, Sharks!
My name is Dmitri Love,
and I'm from Dallas, Texas.
Yeah!
My company is Bundil.
I'm seeking $100,000
for 10% equity in my company.
When it comes to investing,
nothing's hotter right now
than cryptocurrency.
Everyone's talking about it,
but does anyone really know
what they're talking about?
Now, cryptocurrency
is a digital currency,
so investing in it
is a little different.
Now, you could mine
your own currency,
which is best done
with a dedicated mining chip.
Essentially, you're using
decentralized
blockchain technology
to track shares
and validate transactions
using a known algorithm.
These are then added
to the existing blockchain
using an ??
an encryption technique
that controls the creation
of monetary units
and ultimately verifies
the transfer of funds.
[ Sighs ]
That's one way.
Or you could just use Bundil,
the most convenient way
to invest in cryptocurrency.
Bundil allows...
Oh, shoot.
The Bundil app allows, um...
users to automatically invest
their spare change every day
into, um, cryptocurrency.
The Bundil app controls...
Dude...
Higgins:
You're doing great.
You're good, Dmitri.
You're doing great.
Cool, cool, cool.
Sorry about that.
You can start
anywhere you want.
And you look great.
Thank you, thank you.
Dmitri, this is the biggest
moment in your life.
?Shut up, Kevin.
?I agree. I agree.
Bundil is
a mobile application
that allows you to invest
your spare change
from everyday purchases
directly into crypto.
Um, the app, uh, automatically
tracks your spending habits.
So, if you were to go buy
this coffee for $3.45,
the 55 cents would
be rounded automatically
and invested into the
cryptocurrency of your choice.
Um...
you don't need thousands
of dollars to start investing.
Just keep doing
what you're doing,
leave the complicated math
and algorithms behind,
and Bundil will take care
of the rest.
So, which one of you wants
to hop on board with Bundil
and make bundles of cash?
?[ Chuckles ] Yay.
?All right.
Good, uh ??
Good finish there.
Do you think, um,
you could possibly...
Yeah.
...simplify
what is cryptocurrency?
You'd be breaking
entirely new ground
if you could explain it.
Oh, for sure.
So, it's just like money
and, in a small way,
kind of like stocks.
It's like money in that you can
use it for purchases of ??
uh, for services and goods.
Um, it's like stocks because,
um, the value fluctuates.
Dmitri, why don't you give us
a little insight
into, uh, what gave you
this idea?
I'm a web developer myself,
and I wanted to invest
in cryptocurrency,
and my family
also wanted to invest,
so they came to me and
they're like, "Dmitri,
how do we buy this?
Like, what do we do?"
So I thought,
I was like, "Man, you know,
anyone that's trying to invest
in cryptocurrency
has to go through all
these steps,
um, to try and figure out
how to buy it,"
and I thought there could be
an easier way for it to be done.
Which cryptos
does it support?
Uh, so right now,
it only supports, uh,
Bitcoin, Ethereum,
and Litecoin.
How does Bundil
make money?
We charge a monthly fee
of $3 a month,
or, if you pay
for the entire year, it's $24.
So, start us ?? start me
from the beginning.
Okay.
I download the app.
So, right now,
we only have, um,
a minimum viable product.
We did our soft launch
about 60 days ago.
We have an iOS app, um,
the web app is almost completed,
and we're working on Android
as we speak.
O'Leary: Why are you going
to get market share?
What's ?? What's special about
Bundil that is going to
take away share from the wallets
that already exist?
So, the "set it and forget it"
mentality
is very popular
among micro?investment users.
There are a few competitors
in the space that have done
really, really well with the
micro?investment technology.
I'm in the
financial?services industry.
I also have apps that do
the same thing this does.
Not crypto, but I do
fractional?share ownership
in an app called Beanstox.
Mm?hmm.
Here's what we learned
about the space.
Most apps fail within 36 months
over 80%
because they're never
able to get the customer
acquisition cost
below the lifetime value.
How are you gonna
get customers?
Um, so, we can actually
advertise on Facebook.
That is one big thing.
That's a very expensive way
to acquire a customer.
Yes.
Far better would be a viral
approach, a blog approach,
an influencer approach, and
all of the above simultaneously.
It's really, really hard.
So, our customer
acquisition costs
are actually only
$2.77 right now.
?How do you know that?
?How do you know that?
We have about 360 users,
and we've put $1,000
into marketing ??
yep, just the monthly.
Greiner: Dmitri,
I know for some people,
they think cryptocurrency
is just the wave,
or going to be the wave.
Yeah.
Um, for me,
I'm not so sure.
I'm still on
the crypto fence,
so I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, Dmitri, I mean,
I always try to help out
Dallas entrepreneurs.
[ Chuckles ]
Challenge here is I'm
an investor in a company
called ChangEd, which,
as you know, i?is comparable
in a lot of ways, so...
Definitely.
...for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
I think, uh, the digital
currency space is here to stay,
but it's still just
the wild, wild west.
Yeah.
So, it's very volatile,
it's unregulated.
Definitely.
So I think it's a little
too early for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
O'Leary: Dmitri, what I like
about this is it falls into
my financial literacy
platform.
I've been
crisscrossing America,
lecturing on Saturdays
at colleges
about how important it is
to take a portion of your pay,
or whatever your income source
is, and invest it.
Here's my offer.
So, I'll give you $100,000,
I want to be a 50% partner,
and I'll tell you why.
You are going to be stunned
at how expensive it is
to acquire customers, and I have
the metrics on this nailed,
and we'll have to put up
more money as time passes.
Can you commit to putting up
money as time passes?
If it's working.
I pour gasoline,
I put millions of dollars
into my financial platforms.
Millions.
Dmitri, one of the big
frustrations I have
with Bitcoin is...
Oh, you bet??
...that there still
isn't any use for it
from a consumer standpoint,
right,
Dmitri, have you seen Kevin walk
away from deals before?
I have.
I think you should consider
partnering up
with different
token economies 'cause
they're sprouting up
all over the place.
You can piggyback off
their marketing machine
to go ahead and push your app.
After the regulators say yes.
After ??
After they say yes.
But I like the idea
of you partnering
with all those different
token exchanges and saying ??
That's a great way
to kill your business
while you're trying
to get it started.
Well, I disagree.
There are a few reasons why
it's just not for me.
I think it's too easy
to create a competitor,
there's too many similar
products already out there,
and it's just too early.
Um, it's not investable
in my opinion,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
?Kevin ??
?Dmitri, just so you understand,
I'm either 50/50
or I'm nothing.
Your decision.
But 50% is quite a bit.
Well, Dmitri, I wouldn't look
a gift horse in the mouth.
It's a great opportunity
to take on all the hassles
you're struggling with.
O'Leary: This is the moment.
You have to decide if you
want me as a partner or not.
It's your decision.
It's a great offer,
Dmitri.
[ Inhales deeply ]
[ Sighs ] Kevin,
I'll accept your offer.
?Yeah, smart move, Dmitri.
?All right.
You made the right decision,
my friend.
You made
the right decision.
Appreciate it.
Let's go make it happen.
Sure.
I got a lot of work
for you, bud.
[ Laughing ]
He doesn't look happy.
?He doesn't look so happy.
?He doesn't look too happy.
?[ Laughs ]
?He made the ??
He looks miserable.
Just launched my business
60 days ago,
and to have a Shark on board
is just a dream come true.
I can't believe it.
It's [laughing] amazing.
[ Laughs ]
He walked out like this!
Daymond and Mark,
you've got ??
You've got to understand
something.
[ Laughter ]
I don't do good deals,
I do great deals.
Remember the cupcake lady?
Her daughter started crying
when they did a deal with you?
[ Laughter ]
And ?? And today,
she's a millionaire.
I love it.
So, we have six locations.
I opened my first one
in July 2012,
took all my life savings,
which was $70,000.
It had 12 seats and a counter
and one employee.
[ Chuckles ]
Now we are
all over Manhattan.
On our bigger units,
we do about $2 million a year.
Uh, and then when we do ??
How many square feet
is the bigger unit?
It's big.
It's 2,500 square feet.
Wow. Great.
The first one I opened
was 280 square feet,
which I did a million dollars
out of.
?Hmm.
?Okay.
Wow!
And I have one that is
108 square feet
that I do $600,000 out of.
The whole idea of this, it's
a commissary?based business,
so we have one big kitchen
that supplies everything.
A?And the restaurants can be
as small as 600 square feet?
It can be as small as 250.
So, you're a grab?and?go
restaurant, right?
You're not a "sit here
and watch us make this"...
No, we're grab and go.
It's fast?casual,
but we do have another model,
and that's the 2,500 square feet
that we opened recently.
And then what made you pivot to
this 2,500?square?foot model?
At the end of 2015,
I partnered up with, uh,
the founder
of Ruby Tuesday.
Sandy Beall, right?
Sandy Beall, yes.
I know.
I love your energy.
You have two Sharks,
and we're gonna work, too.
Yeah, and what's great is once
you become part of my family...
Yes.
...you get access to all
the different operators.
You want me to own enough
in New York to drive it as well.
That's a ??
That's a waste if I don't.
I can feel your energy
and your intensity.
I love it.
But my offer's firm, all right?
You get both of us,
you get the entire network,
but I need to be incentivized
to work hard for you.
Everyone always loved
his cooking.
Your father made the kitchen
a place to feel comfortable,
safe, and warm.
I think that it's love
that keeps you strong,
and the foundation
that both our parents
set for the three of us
is what gets us through
each day.
The Sharks should invest in this
product because it's amazing,
and it has the support
of three really strong kids
who love the person
that created it.
John: I love it, 'cause
that's usually the problem.
When you're cutting,
you have to push all the stuff
off to the side
here and there.
Right?
Many of them have a well
built into the board.
Yeah.
But here, you can take it off,
throw it in the dishwasher.
Yeah, 'cause when
you put the ones with the well
built in there, it doesn't fit
straight in the ??
in the dishwasher.
Yeah, exactly,
it doesn't fit. Too tall.
It's an amazing product.
It's incredible.
Thank you.
So, what are your sales?
The three of us actually
just began
three weeks ago
selling the board.
'Cause you have 2,000
in inventory, right?
Yes.
Yeah.
Are you putting that
online?
We just launched our online
store three weeks ago.
How old are you?
I'm 24.
You're 24.
?I'm 20.
?20.
I'm 15.
So your dad wanted
to come on "Shark Tank"
before he passed away?
Yeah.
Yes, that was actually
his audition video.
And on 9/11, where was he?
Which part of the city?
He was part
of the clean?up.
So, he was at ??
he was there for that.
Okay.
And over 2,000 firemen
are actually currently sick
from 9/11 just
from all the fumes
that they were
breathing in, so...
Yeah, I was, um ?? I was
at ground zero on 9/11,
spent two years there
during the clean?up...
Oh, my gosh.
...working with the city
and I met a lot of brave people
like your dad and a lot of
people who lost their lives,
so it's great
that you're doing this.
Together: Thank you.
O'Leary: What are your ??
What's your costs?
$12.50.
Okay, and you're selling them
on the site for?
$40.
$40.
How many have
you sold so far?
300 in the last
three weeks.
?Good for you.
?Wow.
How are you selling them? What
are you doing to market them?
Really great. How are you
getting that ?? Yeah.
Um, just through social media
and our online store,
and then
in our living room,
we're all packaging
the boards together,
writing everyone individual
thank?you notes.
Thank?you cards.
just seeing
your loved one sick.
Um, and we're only
able to be here
because of how strong
our parents were.
You know what?
Is it possible for you
just step out
in the hallway for a second?
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
?Love you.
?Love you.
[ Laughs ]
Awesome!
Oh, my gosh.
That was amazing.
You know, this is the beauty
of entrepreneurship.
?Yeah.
?Yes.
They're gonna be able
to support themselves.
This is a product
that'll go on forever.
Higgins: I love it.
And the beautiful thing is,
is that they have each other.
