You guys ready for this?
You want to try some soup?
You want to try
some soup?
?Absolutely.
?Come on. Bring it on.
?Let's do this.
?Yeah.
We've got
some great soup for you.
?Bring it on.
?Okay, sir.
?Thank you.
?You're welcome.
Okay,
so what we have here
is our chilled watermelon
gazpacho in the bottle,
we also have a West African
peanut stew,
we have our summer
minestrone,
curried
red lentil peach...
Mmm.
...and we have an
Indian?style mulligatawny.
Mmm.
The ?? The curried peach
is fantastic.
?Thank you!
?It's great.
What's your background?
Well, we have been
doing this since 2008.
Back in 2008, I was
a former stand?up comic...
You were?
...looking for
a good bowl of soup.
Something that hopefully didn't
have a ton of salt and fat,
and I failed miserably.
So, obviously, I dragged my poor
mother out of retirement.
Yeah, so, let me ??
I'll tell you the real story,
how this started.
Okay, she ??
she does this sometimes.
You mean she's been lying to us
all the time?
No, but I ?? I was in there
from the beginning.
So, let me tell you.
[ Chuckles ]
I would never count you guys
out, all right?
?Thank you.
?You're gonna do $3.4 million.
You obviously have a sense of
what it is to sell your product,
but I don't think at the moment
it's a big business
and I can get
a big return on it.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate that.
Matthew, why are you
encouraging her on? You
know the model's broken.
Well, you know why?
You know why? You know why?
?You know the model's broken.
?So, I'm ?? I'm encouraging
because I think, at the end
of the day, I think they're
gonna figure it out.
Don't take any encouragement
from Matthew.
There's more percentage
likelihood ??
Are you ?? I know. Are you
gonna ?? Are you gonna leave ??
leave the show and reflect
about whether or not
to go with a copacker?
Sure, I'm go?? absolutely
gonna reflect.
But you'll
never do it.
And she won't do it.
You won't do it.
?Are you in? Lori's still in.
?I don't want you to take
any encouragement
from Matthew's comments
'cause you still have a 50/50
chance of going zero, okay?
I hate when he says
that, but in this case,
he might be right.
Lori, what do you have to say?
Okay.
I think the Soupergirl logo
and name is fabulous.
Thank you!
It's very cute.
It's very memorable.
There's one thing that,
for me, is not great.
5% profit margin.
Our profit margin
used to be much bigger.
But when we opened up
this new facility,
of course it went down,
but it is ??
But ?? But the problem is ??
?You're making her point.
?But that's a huge problem.
Great soup,
but as an investor, I'm out.
?Good luck, guys.
?Thank you.
?Good luck.
?Thank you!
?Good luck.
?Good soup, though.
?Appreciate the feedback.
?Thank you.
Thank you.
It's very delicious.
See you, Bubbe.
[ Laughter ]
ever since that guy bought pizza
with 10,000 Bitcoins.
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Guy Vaknin,
and I'm the chef and owner
of Beyond Sushi.
I'm seeking a $1.5 million
investment in exchange
for 25% of our planned venture
on the West Coast
and 5% of our current operation
on the East Coast.
Beyond Sushi's a multi?unit
vegan restaurant
operating in New York City.
We take a modern approach
to traditional sushi
by creating unique flavor
profiles using vegetables,
fruits, and whole grains
without relying on fake meats
while having a balance
between nutrition and flavor.
Our extensive menu
includes salads, wraps,
dumplings, and rolls.
We are one of the pioneers
of the vegan sushi movement
and creating a better,
healthier,
much more sustainable way
of eating.
Sharks, if you dive into
this deal with me,
there will be plenty of fish
for you guys to swim with.
[ Laughs ]
Do we get samples?
?Yeah, let's eat!
?Of course.
Yeah.
I brought you three of
our best?seller rolls.
I'm hungry.
But then I'm always hungry.
Ah, this looks amazing.
Amazing.
Amazing!
Uh, we have the Mighty Mushroom,
which has four?grain rice,
baked tofu inside shiitake,
enoki, micro arugula,
and a truffle...
Mmm!
?Yeah, that's good.
?...shiitake sauce.
Right next to it,
we have the Sunny Side.
It has braised fennel,
sun?dried tomato, avocado,
roasted butternut squash,
and a pesto sauce on top.
So good.
Yeah, they're a little bit
more intricate.
That mushroom one
is the truth.
?Mmm.
?Thank you very much.
How do the calories compare
to normal sushi?
So, it averages, with the sauce,
at 280 calories.
?For a roll?
?For a roll.
And a roll
is eight pieces.
So it's about the same?
Yeah.
What does it cost
for eight pieces?
Okay, you can buy eight pieces,
which is one roll,
uh,
and it will cost you $7.50.
It costs me about
a buck 50 to make.
Yeah, great guy.
He has 25% of the company.
And you have 75%?
75%, yes.
So,
when you talk about 25%,
that's of
the East Coast, right?
Yes.
And I'm guessing you own 100%
of the West Coast
because you haven't
really started it yet.
Yes.
Tell us, for the last year,
what your sales have been
and whether you're
profitable or not.
So, last year, we did
$4 million in sales.
What did you net on it?
So, last year was the year that
we made basically the change.
So, I took a commissary,
I opened two big locations,
so I was negative $272,000.
How much did you invest
last year?
I put $160,000 out of my own
pocket into the business
just to keep it running 'cause
we did lose money, right?
The year before that,
when we were doing $2.4 million,
I put in my pocket $600,000.
And we're projecting
$5.6 million for this year.
What will you make on the
$5.6 million, do you think?
This year, we're gonna make
around $300,000.
Higgins: Chef, I understand
this space really well.
Yes, yeah.
I have a number of
different investments ??
&amp;pizza, I'm actually
on a board with Sandy.
I heard, yes.
Yes.
So I know this space
very well.
I want to go
a little deeper.
Tell me what your average
cover side is.
Dinnertime,
we do about $22 a head.
Uh, at lunch time,
it's, uh, $15.
Okay, give me your traction.
How you been doing?
Have you been growing in covers?
Are you growing?
Oh, yeah.
So, we've been growing, like
I said, for the whole company,
I told you we were
$2,050,000.
The year before that,
we were $978,000,
so we doubled in size
in one year.
I want to go deeper.
Stay with me on the unit
economics, all right?
Yes. No problem.
So you know an ideal QSR?
Yep.
Or, you know, a fast?casual
restaurant should be doing
20% profit
at the store level.
Yep. Uh?huh.
Where are you right now
after how many years?
So, we're doing ??
we're doing 20% on ??
Well, I'm ??
I'm ?? I'm finding out a lot.
So, I know nothing about
that end of the retail.
Like...
Yes.
...Matt asked you ??
What did you ask him?
What's his PR? QR?
QSR ??
Quick Service Restaurant.
I had no idea what
any of that was,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm struggling with
a different problem.
I'm gonna make the assumption
you'll be as successful
on the West Coast as you were
on the East Coast.
Yes.
And you're going to generate,
after three years,
$5?plus million
on the operations...
Yes.
...if the ?? if the footprints
look the same.
Here's the problem
with this.
Yeah.
You're gonna make
$300,000 pre?tax
on $5?plus million
in sales.
Yes?
We agree?
I agree.
Okay.
I give you $1.5 million
to get 25% ownership
in the West Coast.
Okay.
I'm basically paying
20 times pre?tax earnings.
I think you're insane.
Your valuation's insane.
I'm out.
Okay.
Chef.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What's the vision
for the brand, right?
In order for these
to be successful,
it has to be a strong,
sustainable vision
if not a fad.
Of course.
I want to hear a little bit
more about that.
It's not a secret.
I mean, you know it,
'cause you're in
the food business.
It's shifting towards
everything plant?based,
everything healthier.
This is no imitation.
Everything that
you see over here
is fruits, vegetables,
whole grains, beans.
Cuban: Okay,
so wait, wait, wait.
You're not alone in doing
plant?based sushi
and comparable plant?based
other options.
The problem is here you are on
a mission on the East Coast,
which is hard enough.
Yes.
Then you want to do it again
and, you know,
I didn't see a clone anywhere
coming up in the pitch.
So, my gut's telling me no.
I'm out.
So, here's what I don't like
about the deal.
I don't like the
misalignment of the fact
that I'm getting 5% equity
in a concept
that already has
a lot of traction...
Here it comes.
...and then I'm paying
$1.5 million
for what may
or may not work.
We all intuitively feel
like you're gonna do great
out here, right?
But I don't know.
And I know you're gonna be
putting in as much time
in New York
as you are in L. A.
So there's a misalignment
between you and I
because I'm gonna want you
to spend all your time in L. A.
I need you to align
my interests
in L. A. and New York.
Okay.
How can you do better by
bringing those two together?
Matt is interested in Guy's
plant?based sushi business,
Beyond Sushi,
but he wants more of the
established East?Coast business
than the current 5%
that Guy is offering.
I think that I can go
a little bit higher
in the one
that we have on the East Coast,
if that would
make the deal happen.
Eh...
How much higher?
And at the end of the day,
guys, look,
as much as I gonna have
all the access in the world
and everything,
I'm gonna work.
That's what I did
with this company.
I built it. You guys,
I?I worked three years.
Thank you.
?Congrats, Guy.
Good job.
Congrats, man.
Ahh!
Ahh!
This was fun.
[ Exhales quickly ]
I really like that guy.
I knew he was gonna go far.
It was worth it to give up
a little bit more equity.
I got two Sharks, and we can
take all their knowledge,
and take the investment,
and just go light speed
to where we want to be.
For me, "Shark Tank"
taught me that anyone
can be an entrepreneur no matter
your situation or your age.
So don't make excuses
and just go for it.
Your dad sounds like
an amazing guy.
Can you tell us a little bit
more about when he invented it
and give us a little more
of the story?
Yes. Um, my dad invented this
when I was in high school.
And then as he was getting
his first prototypes,
our mom was diagnosed
with breast cancer.
Cuban: Ohh.
And he put everything on hold
to be by her side.
I was 19 at the time.
My brother was 15,
and my sister was 9.
Um, on August 22, 2012,
God called my mom home,
and my dad just showed us what
strength was in every moment
that he continued
to show up for us,
and just in life
in general.
He was a true inspiration,
just like our mom.
And then, um, my dad took
a break with the Cup Board Pro.
He was asked to be on "Chopped,"
and he did it,
and he was a two?time
"Chopped" champion,
which then gave him
the confidence
to start working
on this again.
In December, um, he got his
delivery of 2,000 boards,
and at that time,
he was diagnosed with cancer,
which was a 9/11?related cancer
from being a fireman there.
And [voice breaking]
um, he was on hospice
in the beginning
of the year,
and he just passed away
three months ago.
I'm so sorry.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Wow.
amazing invention
right here for you guys.
We're gonna pass
you guys each one.
Lori: Great. Thank you.
You guys are real
entrepreneurs now, huh?
Yeah.
What's the money gonna be
used for, the $100,000?
Now, we're still gonna
make you guys work.
Yes,
we're ready to work.
All right, 'cause I know
you're already hard workers.
So, it's not gonna be easy.
Don't worry.
We're not here for easy.
?Congrats, guys.
?Thank you so much, guys.
?Thank you guys so much.
?It's exciting.
Love you, guys.
Good job.
