I'm Keira.
I'm Christian.
I'm Kaley.
And we're siblings
from Long Island, New York.
Our dad, Keith,
was a New York City fireman.
He was a firehouse chef.
Keira: Our product was
designed by our dad
and is created to simplify
the way you work in the kitchen.
My dad was ready to introduce
his product to the world,
but he put everything on hold
when our mom was diagnosed
with stage 4
breast cancer.
She battled for two years
and lost her fight to cancer
on August 22, 2012.
That was the hardest day
of our lives.
Losing our mom was
really hard for our dad,
but we all really
just encouraged him
to make his dream
a reality.
But in 2015, he was diagnosed
with synovial sarcoma,
a cancer that developed
from being a fireman
in the cleanup of 9/11.
Our dad fought
as hard as he could,
but just three months ago,
our dad passed away.
Our dad's funeral was the
biggest tribute to who he was.
Over 1,000 people came.
The New York City
Fire Department
had the whole street
closed down,
and they just really honored
who our dad was as a hero.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kaley Young.
I'm Christian Young.
I'm Keira Young.
Together:
And we're the Young family.
We're here today seeking
$100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our business.
Our business is...
Together: The Cup Board Pro.
Our dad invented
the Cup Board Pro,
and it was his dream to pitch it
on "Shark Tank."
Unfortunately, he passed away
before he had that chance.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But we're here today
to continue his legacy
and make that dream
a reality.
To tell you more
about our dad's invention,
here is a video our dad made
about demoing the Cup Board Pro.
and to share a little bit
of Keith Young
and the Cup Board Pro
with you all.
So, who's ready to make our
dad's dream a reality with us?
That was very moving.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Christian: So, we have ??
we have this amazing ??
Kaley: It's ??
My dad was all about quality.
So it's bamboo.
We have three patents
on the board and the cup.
The tongue and groove
is really important.
My dad has his fireman logo
on the board, and if you see,
it has the number of how many
firemen died on 9/11, so...
?Oh. I didn't notice that.
?Oh, wow.
?Yep.
?It's on the back?
It's something
that really honors
the fire department.
This board is really heavy,
really great quality.
Engineered smart.
So, this well,
no matter where you put it,
it's going to run ??
the juices will run down
because it's pitched higher
in the back.
Keira: We have to
renew our tooling,
and then for marketing
and advertising,
which is like $20,000,
and then, like,
all?new cutting boards,
which would be around $50,000.
You mean, um, inventory?
Yeah.
So, are you running
the business basically ??
the three of you together,
that's it?
Together: Yes.
?You're running everything?
?Yes.
Higgins: So, what ?? So, what
overwhelms you right now?
Tell us why you're here
and what you're looking for
in a Shark to help you with.
Kaley: I think, honestly,
it's kind of hard
to overwhelm the three of us
just because of...
[ Chuckles ]
...like, the amount of stress
that you go through
Kaley: Now that we have
all five Sharks on board,
we can really make
our dad's dream come true.
Our dad would probably be
so proud of us,
and, like, so happy that
we're continuing on his legacy,
his dream.
Bring it in.
Bring it in.
