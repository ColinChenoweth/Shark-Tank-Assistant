by working hard...
We took a huge chance.
I quit a full?time job.
...by working smart...
Who here would like to help us
refine the gentleman?
...by thinking big...
BoomBoom is intended for intense
refreshment and rejuvenation.
...and chasing their dreams.
My dream is want to come America
to be a fashion designer.
Narrator: And tonight,
legendary NBA star
and investor Charles Barkley
joins the Tank.
Barkley: Anytime
it comes to investing,
you're really investing
in people.
You seem to be
on the right track,
and I'm willing
to take the chance.
Your margins suck.
I think your valuation
is gonna need a haircut.
Whoo!
First into the tank
is a product line
for today's refined modern man.
[ Foreign accent ]
Hi, my name is Steve King,
and this is my son...
[ Foreign accent ]
Josh King.
And we're from
San Diego, California.
Our company
is Manscaped,
and we're here today looking
for $500,000 for 7%.
?7%?
?7%?!
?Whoo!
?Wow.
Sharks, it's time
to talk about it.
Forget about the beard oils
and the hair creams.
When it comes
to male grooming,
there's more to a man
than meets the eye,
for what goes on
below the neck and the waist
can be ignored
no longer.
[ Herjavec chuckles ]
At Manscaped,
we're dedicated to beautifying
and refining what truly
makes a man a man.
We have crafted the only kit
you would ever need
to practice proper lawn care.
[ Laughter ]
When it comes for regions
left neglected
for far too long,
we give you...
The Lawn Mower 2.0.
A trimmer powerful enough
to cut through
any unruly shrubbery
with abandon.
[ Blows ]
[ Laughter ]
As you can see,
when you trim the hedges,
the tree stands taller.
[ Laughter ]
Besides trimming
and shaping the hedges,
the first rule
of manscaping is...
Wash thy bits!
[ Laughter ]
And there's no better way
than with our specially
formulated hygiene bundle.
These pH?balanced solutions
help hydrate and replenish
an area too often forgotten
and left in the dark.
They're tough
on funk and chafe
whilst being delicate
on your delicates.
So, who here would like to help
us refine the gentleman?
Charles wants to be a demo.
Charles wants to demo.
Perfect packages
for your perfect packages.
You need to show Charles
how it works.
?Thank you.
?Of course.
Josh: Lori.
Thank you.
Just to be clear,
it's not for the area here.
It's just for the area...
Correct. It's below?the?waist
grooming and hygiene.
The Plow ??
oh, my gosh.
Absolutely.
Wait ?? [ Laughing ]
Wait a minute!
We have really crafted
the only kit you would ever need
to literally get started
from a manscaping position.
Cuban: So, wait, all of America
and the world wants to know ??
Charles, do you manscape?
Not a day in my life.
[ Laughter ]
So, how did you
get into this?
[ Laughter ]
Josh: Well, one night,
I was having some drinks
with my friends.
We started talking about
manscaping horror stories
where maybe we were
getting ready for dates,
and it didn't work out
'cause we were using
the wrong tools for the job.
Every man is manscaping.
Nobody knows what they're doing.
Josh, how many percentage of men
are manscaping down there?
Back in 2008,
it was about 6%.
Today, it's 73%.
?73%?
?73%?
So, there's been
a dramatic increase.
What caused that?
The Millennial
metrosexual movement of men
wanting to take care
of themselves.
What's your background?
Josh: I graduated college
in 2010,
I spent the last five to six
years in digital agencies
and in the start?up
environment,
learning more SEO and
the ins and outs of e?commerce.
After having that night, the
fateful night with my friends,
I brought the insights
to my pops.
After we dove into
the market,
found it was
a $3 billion industry,
he introduced me
to chemists and engineers,
and that's when
we started working on
the first eight items
of our Perfect Package.
So, y'all are
father and son?
Yes.
Yes, we are.
So, you used to have
hair that good?
Sadly, yes.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.
Josh, why did you go
to your pops?
My pops is, um, my idol.
Oh, that's awesome.
He's a very successful
businessman.
I wouldn't be where
I am without him.
?Aww.
?That's great.
O'Leary: Okay, guys, let's
focus on the task at hand.
$7.1 million valuation.
That's a lot of hair
down there.
[ Laughs ]
So, 2017, we finished off
the year and did $1.5 million.
?Good for you!
?Wow!
We launched
in January 2017.
It took us about
four months to work out
how to message
our target market.
And so we actually almost walked
away and closed the business.
We just couldn't
get it going.
Then we discovered
we should try humor.
Humor would appeal and be able
to resonate with our audience.
So, we had 3,000 sets,
these kits,
and we went
back to market in April
and we sold out
in 13 days.
?13 days?
?And so, what was the message?
And what does it cost?
Where did you do
this marketing?
What was the humor?
We plucked all the stories
that I sat around that table
with my friends and turned them
into live videos,
and we're at
48 million video views.
?Wow!
?48 million?
Yeah, yeah.
How much is this bag?
A whole kit you have
in your hands is $51.
Wow, that's a great price.
What's your cost
to make them?
$12.
But, you know, isn't $51
an odd price point?
Wow, that's great.
That's the average
order value.
Oh, okay. So, if I were
to buy this kit, though ??
So, you have other choices?
Yeah, so you would go ??
You don't have to buy
the whole kit.
Oh, I can buy
individual components?
You can get just ??
Yeah, we try to get you
into a kit first
so that you can
experience the products,
and then we want you to
replenish and come back and ??
That's not a bad price,
though.
How much are you gonna make
on the $1.5 million?
We lost ?? in that year
for $1.5 million,
we lost $133,000.
I'm gonna assume because
your margins aren't big enough
on this to pay for your
customer acquisition cost?
We'd be reinvesting
every penny.
I probably put
about $400,000 ??
The question with this ??
I mean, let's get down
to the business model,
because there's
nothing proprietary
about putting razor blades
and perfumes into a bag
and selling it online.
The whole business now is what's
your customer acquisition cost
versus the margin
of the bag.
What does it cost you to acquire
a customer ?? new customer?
So, right now, customer
acquisition cost is $16.
What's the margin
on the bag?
Right now,
about $7 per kit.
That sucks.
So, why is it
$16 per acquisition?
So, year to date,
we've done $2.1 million.
We would've made about
$60,000 to $80,000 per month,
but we put all that money
back into inventory
and into paid media.
So on our paid media,
any one month,
we spend anywhere between
$120,000 or maybe $150,000 ??
Otherwise known
as advertising.
Both: Yes.
?Okay.
?Got it.
So, for every dollar that
we spend on paid media,
we're trying to generate
$2.50 of revenue.
Greiner: Do women
buy this product?
?Yes.
?For men, yeah.
It's probably not a heavily
gifted item from women.
No, I think
it's the other way,
'cause it's a present
for the woman.
It really is.
[ Laughs ]
Seriously.
Women buying for men,
we found a huge lift
in the holiday season,
especially around
November and December.
O'Leary: Okay, so, I look at it
from simply how do ??
I put up $500,000, and I want
to get back $2 million.
That's the kind of
investment I'd want.
It's not clear to me
how this is gonna work,
and frankly, I think the model
isn't nailed down yet.
I'm out.
Charles,
what are you gonna do?
I ?? Listen.
[ Sighs ]
Like I told you, I've never
manscaped in my life,
and I'm not starting now,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
Herjavec: All right, guys,
I've heard enough.
I think you have
an incredible brand.
You've got a great ?? I don't
want to call it a shtick,
because it
undermines it, but ??
It <i>is</i> shtick.
It's great, though.
Yeah, it's great.
It's a great marketing angle.
I do manscape. I was on
"Dancing With the Stars."
They made me get a wax,
and I just kind of went crazy.
Now I manscape
everywhere.
And I think
a lot of people do.
Was that a Brazilian?
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
But the numbers scare me.
There's no way I'm giving you
$500,000 for 7%.
I would need a lot more.
What's your offer?
I think your valuation
is gonna need a haircut.
Robert is interested in Josh and
Steve's male?grooming company,
Manscaped, but he wants
a bigger stake of the company
than the 7% they are offering.
I'll give you the $500,000,
but I'm gonna need,
at this early stage...
...35%.
Ooh!
O'Leary:
Yippie?aye?oh?ki?yay!
What are you doing, Lori?
Greiner:
So, when you first came in
before you started talking
and I just saw "Manscaped,"
I was thinking,
"Well, this probably is not
the product for me."
But, Lori...
Honestly, like, you know,
I'm just gonna talk about, like,
being careful with scissors
and get out, right?
[ Laughter ]
But your routine was fabulous ??
funny as can be.
The accent
really boosts this.
It helps.
This is a lovely kit.
I see how the customer
could be women.
Mark said something
that was really interesting.
He said, "It's actually
<i>for</i> the women."
Technically, it is.
This is perfect for QVC!
I ?? Really ??
Lori, I'll put up the money just
to watch you sell it on QVC.
[ Laughs ]
Would you really?
All right,
if Mark is in $500,000,
I help sell it on QVC,
what's your offer?
Um...
He was kidding.
Yeah, well,
now I've trapped him.
the chance of you
walking out of the Shark Tank
with half a million dollars
was zero.
You have a real offer.
What are you gonna do?
Josh: We're agile
as it is right now,
but you add
two strategic players,
imagine how quickly
we're gonna solve issues.
I'm speechless.
[ Sighs ]
Welcome to "Shark Tank."
Our company's BoomBoom,
and we're seeking $300,000
in exchange for 10%
of our business.
Sharks, we have a new
best friend for your nose.
It's time to turn breathing
into money.
Think about it ??
your eyes have eye drops,
your mouth has mouthwash,
and your lips have lip balm.
But there's not an everyday
healthy and safe product
for your nose to enjoy.
Introducing BoomBoom.
BoomBoom is
an all?natural nasal inhaler
made of essential oils, menthol,
and other stimulating scents.
Most products for your nose
are for congestion or allergies.
BoomBoom is intended for intense
refreshment and rejuvenation.
Just unscrew the cap, place
the barrel inside each nostril,
and inhale
slowly but deeply.
[ Laughter ]
It's like gum for your nose,
but 10 times more minty?fresh.
With each inhale,
you'll experience a cooling,
tingly sensation
that makes you feel alive.
So, Sharks,
who wants to invest
and get this business
booming?
?I want to smell it.
?Yeah.
You must be making
a ton of money.
Net profit last year was
$120,000 after I paid myself.
Where's it made at?
It's made in
southern California.
You couldn't reduce your costs
by going offshore?
To 69 cents.
At scale, we can bring
our costs down about 25%.
We want to make it
in the U. S.
Your cost is fine.
Because you're inhaling it,
we want to make sure
the ingredients are top?notch.
And what's
your wholesale price?
Our wholesale price
is $1.50.
?Ohh.
?Oh, wow.
That's not a good margin.
Yeah, but ??
Ooh, I like
the other margin.
Why did you do that?
Is it because you're concerned
that they'll put it out
at too high a price point?
So, we feel like the sweet spot
in retail is $3.99.
But you're selling it
for more than that on the site,
your own site.
But that ?? Yeah.
You're undercutting yourself
at a lower margin.
I understand that,
but we've tested $3.99 to $5.99,
depending on the store.
?And?
And $3.99,
it moves a lot quicker.
Is this y'all full?time job?
Yes.
I'm actually a dentist,
so I do that part time.
That's why those smiles
are so nice.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah.
What's intriguing
is you're saying
that the retail price point
that works ??
sub $4, $3.99 ??
is basically half of what
you're putting it out
on your own store at...
right?
But you have to understand,
there's been <i>no</i> focus in retail.
I did not think that
you'd be talking about
a million?dollar year
when you came out here
with this thing,
'cause I've never
heard of it.
But now you want to play
in the big leagues,
and that is really expensive.
You know, I keep looking at it,
and I'm intrigued,
but there's no way I would
give you a $3 million valuation.
I'm out, guys.
Thanks.
You know, I was thinking,
you know,
maybe if it's in
your purse or whatever,
you go into
a public restroom,
sometimes
that's super unpleasant,
and I was thinking if you had
that and you used the BoomBoom.
Airplanes.
Airplanes, as well.
But $300,000 for 10%
for something that I'm concerned
is, like, a one?time buy...
...just doesn't resonate,
so I'm out.
Well, I think this is
a really neat thing,
but it's not something I'm gonna
do on a consistent basis.
You being a dentist,
don't you quit that job.
[ Laughs ]
I'm gonna have to pass.
I'm out.
Thanks.
It's not that
the valuation's too high.
It's that your margins,
your net margins, are too low.
You know, particularly
if you're gonna go
so heavily to retail,
I just don't see that.
It's only gone marginally viral,
as opposed to,
hey, everybody's
picking it up.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thanks.
Hang on a sec.
[ Sniffs ] Wow!
I love it.          Yes, Robert.
I like it.
What's interesting to me is
all the Sharks liked it.
There were some concerns,
but nobody liked your valuation.
We must be tired
or something,
'cause we do have the ability
to change the valuation.
I see it
as a bit of a flyer.
It could go boom, boom,
or behh!
I'll give you the $300,000,
but I want to be in
where <i>you're</i> in ?? 36%.
?Ohh!
?Ichi?wawa caramba!
It's a flyer.
That means you're
no longer at 36%.
It's the valuation.
How do I get
to that $3 million?
I can't.
$300,000 for 36%.
but that's not gonna stop us
from really making this happen.
We know there's a place
for BoomBoom,
and we look forward
to everybody trying it out.
We're seeking $250,000
in exchange
for 10% of our company.
Have you ever tried
to cut sugar, carbs,
or gluten
from your diet...
Find you're hunting
at the grocery store,
then realize
it's in everything?!
Do you ever wake up,
eat your pancakes,
and then need a nap?
Because you crash
from all the carbs.
[ Laughs ]
Are you ever craving sweets
so badly,
you can't resist the urge
any longer and you melt down?
And binge on ice cream?!
[ Laughter ]
Both: Cave Shakes
to the rescue!
Ta?da.
Cave Shakes are great
as a dessert, snack,
or meal replacement.
They're dairy?free
and gluten?free...
Super low?carb...
...ready to drink...
...great for
pre? and post?workouts...
...and a sweet treat
without the sugar.
So, Sharks...
[ Laughter ]
? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
take it to the gym day ?
? Cave Shake ?
? Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
take it to a party ?
? Cave Shake ?
? Sunday, Funday,
take it to your honey ?
? Cave Shake ?
? They taste great! ?
Both: Cave in to a Cave Shake,
the treat without the cheat.
[ Greiner laughs ]
So, we heard
the Sharks love to eat.
We got some samples
for you.
?Good.
?Good.
?Great.
Charles, you got to get up there
and do that dance.
Herjavec: Nice dance.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
?? Cave Shake ?
?? Cave Shake ?
? Cave Shake ?
We've got a sample
for everybody.
Lots of samples.
They're very filling.
There you go, Robert.
?Okay.
?Just grab one of these puppies?
And then we've got a full ??
I'm gonna stand up
so I don't mess this up.
Sorry. They're a little hard
to grab there.
And then the full chocolate
is for you.
?? Cave Shake ?
?? Cave Shake ?
It's a catchy song.
It's basically like
tricking your body
into burning fat
for fuel.
It's low?carb diet.
Yes.
Yeah, it's basically
a low?carb diet.
How much is this?
$7.99.
It retails for $7.99.
?How much?
?$7.99.
What's it cost you
to make it?
The average cost between
the four flavors is $1.86.
That's not bad.
Where are you selling them at?
Southern California,
currently. Um...
Mostly
in health food stores?
Mostly in health food stores,
exactly, yeah.
You're asking
for real money.
A quarter of a million dollars
is real money, okay?
Sure.
I always look at what's leaking
from the deal behind me.
I'm just looking at
the $400,000 to $500,000
you're gonna do this year
and the challenges
you're gonna have ??
We're gonna do $750,000
this year at least,
even with launching
our pre?orders just now.
Well,
if you're gonna do that,
why are you leaving the risk
of getting diluted?
Turn around
and whack that incubator.
Get rid of them.
I can't stand another guy
getting a royalty
when Mr. Wonderful's
not wetting his beak.
That's crazy.
?Are you making an offer?
No, I'm not.
I'm out.
No, I hear you.
I'm talking about as far as
the stuff you need
to play sports.
You need great energy.
Well, that <i>is</i> energy.
That's great energy.
I think it's ??
It's loaded with MCTs,
which are the best?burning fuel
in our bodies.
I appreciate your energy.
The product, I like.
But there's just too much work
to do with you guys.
For that reason, I'm out.
Greiner:
I like what you're doing.
I personally follow
a more paleo diet,
sometimes keto
if I want to lose weight.
The only thing
that kind of stops me
is it's a lot of calories,
a little bottle,
and I'm not really the person
who likes to drink
their calories, versus eat them.
So I don't think
it's the right product for me.
I'm out.
Charles,
what are you gonna do?
I ?? I?I tell you what...
Yeah.
Uh?oh.
I will give you
the $250,000.
?Oh!
?What?!
What?
But...
O'Leary: Hang on.
20%.
?Oh.
?$250,000.
That's not crazy
at all.
Would you come down
to 14%?
?14%?!
?[ Laughing ] 14%?
That's a long way down.
[ Laughter ]
And so, you've already
gave somebody 15%
who didn't put a dime in.
Yep! Yippie?aye?oh.
I actually think
my offer's fair.
What did you like
about this business
that you would actually
make an offer like that?
I've struggled with my weight
since I retired.
I would like to be involved
with a product
that helps people
lose weight.
You know, and listen,
let's get one thing straight.
Anytime
it comes to investing,
it's great to have
a great product,
but you're really
investing in people,
and I like you two.
O'Leary: So, what are you
gonna do?
Thanks, Charles.
I like you, too.
$250,000, 20%.
Best friend of 20 years,
talk to her every day.
Trust her more than anybody
on the planet, so...
And?
Well, you better
talk to <i>me</i> right now.
[ Laughter ]
You're staying at 20%?
There's no budging with that?
I think my offer's fair.
I don't think we're willing
to give away that much equity,
but...
What?!
Yeah.
?It's Charles Barkley!
?Are you kidding?!
I know!
We're, like...
Barkley: Well...
I want it.
Yeah?
Are you sure you can't
come down to, like, 18%?
O'Leary: No!
You got an offer for a quarter
of a million dollars here.
Are you saying no?
You want to do it?
I do. I think he'll help us
kill it with the athletes.
Sharks,
we're seeking $250,000
for 10% interest
in our company.
Listen, I always hated
wearing a dress shirt.
They are stiff,
they are scratchy.
That's why I invented
Butter Cloth,
the shirt that
make you feel like
you are wearing
your favorite T?shirt
but still look like
you are fully employed.
Butter Cloth's a unique fabric
made of 100% natural,
sustainable,
long?fiber cotton.
But don't take
<i>my</i> word for it.
Let's bring in our long?fiber
in?house scientist,
Metta World Peace.
?Oh, no.
?[ Chuckles ]
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, there goes
the neighborhood.
Oh, my goodness.
What's up, Sharks?
[ Laughter ]
How are you Sharks doing?
It's so good to be here.
As your in?house Butter Cloth
long?fiber cotton scientist,
it's my job to ensure
that every shirt maintains
its six?way stretch
and breathability.
Watch this.
Okay. Here we go.
[ Laughs ]
"Slamma Jamma."
They used to call me Shaq
in the whiskey.
[ Grunts ]
[ Cheers and applause ]
So, now...
Hey, that was close.
It wasn't like yours.
[ Laughs ]
But not every day you can see
a dunk like that
in a shirt like this.
[ Laughs ]
Guys, you're a very
eclectic?looking group.
[ Laughter ]
I'm just saying,
I'm just saying.
How did you
come together?
Want me to start?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll start.
So, I have a background.
In college,
I majored in math.
Obviously, I went to the NBA,
but I'm very into marketing,
'cause I only want to get
involved in things
I can market, you know?
And when I put
this shirt on,
I was like, "Wow, it's perfect.
It's right up my alley.
It's athletic, I can run
and play basketball in it,
and the sweat goes away,
and it doesn't wrinkle,
and I'm like,
"I want to be involved."
and when I was 10,
I making my own clothes.
My mom pull me aside, say,
"Fashion business is
very, very poor career.
I want you to be
a lawyer or a doctor."
But my dream is
want to come America
to be a fashion designer.
So I have a big decision
to make ??
whether I make my parent happy
or follow my heart.
So I decided to apply for
fashion school, which is Otis.
It costs $120,000.
Wow.
Unfortunately,
I can't afford it.
And my first job
in fashion business
was working for Mattel,
making clothes for Barbie dolls.
[ Laughs ]
And then I work there
for five years,
learn a lot,
save every dollars,
and then I apply for Otis,
and then finally,
I get my B. A. degree
in fashion.
I'm very lucky to work
with Affliction clothing.
I was a head designer
for them for 10 years.
So, you're the real deal.
I'm the real deal.
Hey, so, let me ask you
a question.
This feels amazing.
Thank you.
So, how much
is this shirt?
It costs from $98 to $118.
And where are
you selling them?
We strictly online
right now.
100% online.
Only online? And what does
it cost you to make one?
Costs are from between
$20 to $25.
And that is landed.
How much have you sold?
Seven months, we do
over $500,000 in sales.
?Wow.
?Wow.
Good for you.
How are you reaching
the public?
Uh, right now,
strictly everything online
through
either Facebook ??
How do people
find you online?
Facebook or Instagram.
Are you buying those ads?
We have a digital
marketing company.
How much money
have you spent
running the company
since November?
I invested
in the company,
so far, is $240,000
with my own money.
I quit my job,
I sold my house,
and I cashed out
my 401(k).
?Wow.
?Wow.
?You're all?in.
?I'm all?in.
You're basically selling it
for $100 each.
They cost you what
to make on average?
$20 to $25 ?? landed.
Okay, so you've got $75
to play with,
and you're acquiring customers
at what price?
Right now, about $40.
Whoa!
Ooh.
What are you gonna do
with the $250,000?
and so many people
have been asking me
for the outfits
I was wearing
that I already have
my feet into that,
and I just don't think
it would be fair to you
to take on another one.
So I'm out.
?Thank you, Lori.
?Thank you, Lori.
Guys, I do know the clothing
business is cutthroat,
and I'm not willing at this
point to put up the money,
so I'm out.
?Okay. Thank you.
?Thank you.
One Shark left.
Robert, what are you doing?
and I think that the guys
that I'm working with
and the ladies
can really help you do
a better job online.
I can't do it for 10%.
And I know how risky it is.
I'll give you the $250,000,
but I want 25%.
Um...
