Hey, Sharks. I'm John Pinto,
and this is my better half.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Chelsea Pinto.
Chelsea has some samples.
There's five scents.
Should I use it
and pass it down?
No, no, no, just...
[ Laughs ]
?Thank you.
?Which is the strongest one?
They're all similar
intensity.
Which is the most popular?
Tropical Rush
is our bestseller.
There's a base of menthol
and peppermint in all of them.
?Whoo.
?Whoo!
?Whoo!
?Whoo!
There you go.
?Whoo!
?Yeah, I love it!
[ Laughter ]
Yes!
That's really good!
It's really quite a hit.
It enhances
your breathing for ??
It does open you up.
Think of it like a mint
for your nose.
There's so many
different uses.
I mean, for me, I love
to BoomBoom in the car,
going to work...
You like ??
...you know,
after a long flight.
It's just refreshing.
Is there other products
like this?
There are two other
nasal inhalers,
but they're not fun
and vibrant like ours.
They have more of a medicinal,
kind of earthy smell to them.
What are your sales?
Last year,
we did $754,000 in sales.
?Good for you.
?What?!
And this year, we're on track
to do $1.1 million.
Wow!
Yeah.
People love this thing.
?Wow.
And how are you selling?
Where are you selling?
It's primarily
direct?to?consumer
through our own website.
Oh, good for you.
That's even better.
And on Amazon.
What's the breakdown
between the two?
It's 20% direct?to?consumer,
30% through Amazon.
45% is wholesale
and other distributors.
Okay, you <i>are</i> doing
wholesale.
Yeah.
How much does it cost to make
one of these little inhalers?
That single pack right there
is 70 cents.
And what do you
sell it for?
We sell that on our website
for $7.95.
Wow.
Well, that's not
a sustainable model, John.
You can't do that
long?term.
Why would I pay 8 bucks for it
when I can get it for $4?
It's a point?of?purchase
product. It really is.
No, I get that, but, John,
your margins suck in retail.
How do you cut the cost?
We sell wholesale
to $2, as well.
$1.50 to $2.
We have some customers
that pay up to $2.
Are y'all
50/50 partners?
So, I own a little over
36% of the company.
The other co?founder
is the same amount,
and then we have
three other people who invested.
What value did they invest at?
And how much?
So, they invested
$200,000,
and they own
25% of the company.
You gave them 25%
for $200,000?
Correct.
You want $300,000
and give us 10%?
Yeah.
Well, there's value now
in the company. We have sales.
Yeah, but there's value
over here, too.
John and Chelsea, I think
you asked for too much cash
in this deal ??
that's the problem.
Everybody's trying
to contort the valuation.
Robert's the only guy
willing to take the risk.
What are you gonna do?
Unfortunately,
we can't ??
I can't give up
that much equity.
Um...
What are you willing
to give up?
Would you be willing
to do 15%?
No. No.
I'm comfortable with 36%,
we do the $300,000,
and we smell our way
to the future.
I don't want to
negotiate down from that.
The highest
we can do is 20%.
Can't do it.
[ Clicks tongue ]
Sorry, guys.
Okay.
?Good luck.
?Thank you so much.
Honestly, this was amazing.
?Thanks.
It's definitely a bummer
not getting a deal with Robert,
