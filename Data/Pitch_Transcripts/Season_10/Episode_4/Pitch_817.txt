Hi, Sharks.
I'm Billie.
And I'm Holly.
Both:
And we're Cave Shake!
Billie: Charles, you have
the coffee here.
?Thank you.
?Yeah, totally.
?Thank you.
?So, it's low in sugar, huh?
Holly: Low in sugar.
No sugar is added.
?No sugar.
?So, we have four flavors ??
Ugh!
Oh, I hate it.
?It's actually good.
Thank you.
I like it.
Thank you.
Why does it taste funny?
It's sweetened with stevia,
so if you're not
a stevia person,
that's probably
what you're tasting.
We get, like, one out of 100
that doesn't like stevia.
So, how many calories
in one of these?
The whole thing, 480.
480?
Yes.
Yeah.
You shouldn't be so concerned
with the calories...
[ Laughter ]
That's easy for you to say.
Charles, how concerned
are <i>you</i> with calories?
Very concerned.
Keto is basically
what they're made for,
so a high?fat,
low?carb diet.
You're eating good,
plant?based fats.
Herjavec:
What are your sales, Holly?
In 2017, our net sales
was $270,000.
Cuban: Not bad.
And this year, to date,
we're at $182,000.
So you doubled, basically.
Yes.
What's your background?
Are you an exercise person?
Yes. I did crazy
hardcore sports growing up.
Not as crazy as this guy.
But I was a ski racer,
so I had a lot of injuries
from sports,
and a keto diet was something
I got turned onto
with lowering inflammation
in the body and the brain.
Sugar and carbs really can make
you feel like crap, honestly.
I was in a really bad
car accident when I was 17.
Ever since then, my body has
never felt the way it should,
and Billie contacted me
and she says,
"You got to try
this new thing."
I did it.
My back pain is gone.
O'Leary: Why are you worth
$2.5 million?
You've asked $250,000
for 10%.
What's the plan?
Did I mention...
No.
...that we partnered
with the official incubator
for the largest beverage company
in the world recently?
Who is that?
Coke, L. A. Libations
as an incubator.
Well, why are you worth
$2.5 million?
They're a strategic partner.
So, they give us ??
15%.
15%, you gave up
to the incubator?
Yep.
Cuban: That's a lot
for an incubator.
?Yeah.
?That's like...
We felt like they were
a really good partner for us
because they come ??
They better be a <i>damn</i> good
partner for you.
They've been awesome.
Then what do
you need us for?
I feel like having a lot of
good people in the mix
to make great decisions is
the best thing you can do.
Put yourself in our shoes.
Why would you even listen
to someone saying,
"Give me $250,000 to get
less equity than someone else
who's offering similar expertise
that I gave for free"?
We don't come
from this industry.
We took a huge chance.
I mean, I quit a full?time job,
I moved across the country ??
O'Leary:
I got a question for you.
I know incubator deals
inside out.
Is there a royalty or
a commission on your deal?
Every one I've seen has one.
Um, so, the commission is
anything above $10,000,
then they get back
commission.
So ??
?Only what they bring in?
Only what they bring in,
correct, yes.
So, wait a minute ??
you're well over $10,000 now.
What commission are you paying
on your sales?
We ?? Since we have no money,
essentially,
we have actually deferred that
until they reach ??
What is the
percentage amount?
Herjavec: Oh, hang on!
But how much
do you owe them?
What is the percentage amount
that you have to give them?
We just started our deal
with them, so...
Yeah.
Guys, don't make me
peel you like an onion.
Just tell me the number.
I guess I'm not understanding
the question.
Mm.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
but Holly and Billie seem unsure
about the terms of the deal
they've made with the incubator
they enlisted
to help their keto shake
company, Cave Shake.
I guess I'm not understanding
the question.
Okay, the question is,
what percentage of sales
are you giving to them?
What accounts
did they bring?
They have not brought in
<i>any</i> accounts.
We just started with them.
?Billie.
?Yep.
It tasted bad to me.
I find the branding
a little confusing,
and I really didn't know
what keto was.
It's a lot of information.
I'm not sure that
I get that from the name.
Totally.
I'm out.
Thank you so much.
Charles, you and I
are both on eternal diets.
Every day is
a diet struggle, right?
Yes.
Would you drink this?
Uh, well, two of
the flavors, I liked,
and two of them I did not like,
in fairness.
But I don't see
the nutritional value...
Oh, man. Whoo!
...as far as ??
Like, it might
be good for you.
Holly?
Holly, Holly.
Give me the code word.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Let's do it.
?All right.
?There we go!
Aw, yeah!
?Congratulations.
?Man!
O'Leary: Everybody
has to sell Holly.
[ Laughs ]
Congratulations.
Let's kill it.
?Thank you, guys.
?Congratulations.
?Thanks, Lori, for all the help.
?Good job, CB.
See, I can see you
losing weight already.
Yeah, I know.
[ Laughter ]
Congrats, big dog.
Thank you, man.
Oh, my God,
that was crazy.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
I love Charles!
I love him.
Oh, my God.
What a nice guy.
Come on!
That guy's amazing!
You know what?
They were fun.
You know what, Charles?
They got great personality,
great energy.
Yep, yep.
And, you know,
people need ??
especially now,
as I've gotten older,
it sucks trying
to lose weight.
[ Laughing ]
Yeah, I know.
So you need every shortcut
you can get.
Charles, you didn't even know
what a keto diet was
until they came in.
I <i>still</i> don't know
what it is.
Greiner: I'll tell you.
[ Laughter ]
