Hi, Sharks.
My name's Gary Falkenburg.
I'm Danh Tran. We are from
Long Beach, California.
And we are...
Both: Butter Cloth!
Falkenburg: Butter Cloth feels
like you're wrapped in a hammock
in the Caribbean
under a palm tree,
but looks like you're giving
a keynote at NASA.
Let's put it this way.
When you are wearing
Butter Cloth shirts,
anything is possible.
Let's do this.
?Here we go.
Run this way.
Ready? Go.
Aah! Ahh!
[ Laughter ]
Now, who would like
to join the team
and make the world
a softer place to live?
Hey, Sharks, you got to
feel it to believe it.
Give me one second.
You have a very good model.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
This is for you,
and this is in order.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Oh, it feels so nice!
Very soft.
Yeah.
Oh, it's like
a cotton shirt.
Perfect for you,
big fella.
All right. Appreciate it
Nice job.
It's 100% cotton?
100% cotton.
And, Danh,
how did you meet Gary?
Falkenburg:
I have another friend of mine
who's actually the C. O. O.
of Butter Cloth now ?? Bob ??
and Bob had asked me
to come out and help him
with some of his sales
and marketing.
I watched this guy
closely.
Danh is
the most dedicated,
unbelievably
remarkable person
I've ever met in my life.
Danh, tell us your story.
Tran: I grew up in Vietnam.
My mom and my dad run
a tailor shop in Vietnam,
Falkenburg: Well,
actually 2/3 of it
is gonna be going into
additional inventory
and about 1/3 of it
into additional marketing.
Are you bringing the marketing
in?house or are you...
That's what our goal is.
That's what we need
some advice on.
There are people
that are extremely good
at reducing
customer acquisition costs.
They're not inexpensive, but
I think for what you're doing,
you're gonna definitely
need one of them,
because that's how
you're gonna survive.
But you're missing
that piece right now.
I'm out.
Obviously, you've got
a customer?acquisition cost
that's less than the margin
on each shirt.
And so the more cash
you have for advertising,
the more you can make.
But yet, you want to put more
into inventory.
That money is more valuable
for advertising...
Marketing.
...than it is for more SKUs
and refreshing SKUs.
Preach it, Mark.
He is so right.
Yeah, that's a challenge.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Greiner: I've learned a lot
in the last couple of years
about the clothing business,
all really by happenstance,
because I just decided
I wanted to make the clothes
that I was wearing
on "Shark Tank"
the last couple of years,
Tran: I just want
to say that, you know,
I put everything
on this company,
and I just want to be here,
make a deal.
Yeah, I ?? I like it.
The material's incredible,
and the fit looks great.
I love your story, Danh,
how you came to America.
?Thank you.
?I know a lot about this space.
I made a couple investments that
have done really well for me.
Mm?hmm.
One of them is Tipsy Elves.
So I like
the online strategy,
Cuban:
Congratulations, Danh.
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughs ]
That's awesome, man.
I really want
to try this shirt.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Congratulations.
Tran: Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I didn't even know
Metta could sew.
[ Laughter ]
I'm great at it.
I'm a scientist.
We got it!
Ahh!
Whoo!
We did it!
We got it!
[ Laughs ]
Yay!
[ Laughs ]
This is a dream come true.
"Shark Tank" is big help,
and just America ??
I'm living the dream.
I'm living the dream.
