Hi, I'm Morgan.
And I'm Arley,
and we're seeking $300,000
for 25% of our company.
Both: And we're your
"Shark Tank" weather girls!
?[ Chuckles ]
?Today in the Tank,
it's gonna
be 75 degrees and sunny
with a 20% chance
of rain.
Perfect day
for some shopping.
Come on! Hurry up!
Let's go!
Morgan, what about
our handbags?
They're gonna
get ruined!
If only there was a raincoat
for your handbag!
[ Laughs ]
There is, silly!
We invented it!
?[ Laughs ]
?We're the sisters
behind the Handbag Raincoat!
The Handbag Raincoat is
a chic and innovative way
to protect your handbag
from all of Mother Nature's
elements!
It comes in
three different sizes,
so we've got you covered
no matter how much
you like to tote around.
[ Laughter ]
With the
Handbag Raincoat,
you never have to worry about
getting stuck in the rain again.
?[ Chuckles ]
?So, Sharks...
Both: Who wants to join us
and own the rain
with the Handbag Raincoat?
And now
we have some samples.
And we're gonna pass out
some samples.
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
?Are you okay?
?Yes.
?A little wet, but we're okay.
?Just a little wet.
So, Barbara,
we have one for you.
Yellow ?? my favorite color.
Thank you.
?Lori.
?Pink.
?Mr. Wonderful, for your wife.
?Thank you so much.
How do you know I don't have
a bag I want to cover?
[ Both laugh ]
Thank you.
?Sara.
?Thank you.
Mark, this is
for your wife, also.
Mark, this is for your wife.
Thank you. Thank you.
I call Arley. I'm like, "We need
to figure out protection."
So, we bought
shower curtains,
we started cutting them on our
living?room floor with scissors,
and we came up with
our patent ??
utility patent pending
for the closure ??
for the hook?and?loop
closure of the Velcro.
It lets you get
in your bag easily
and then seal it back up.
And this is a new category.
This never existed before.
What have you experienced
in just sales?
?To date ??
?And in what period of time?
How long have you
been in business?
We've been in business
just about three years
right now.
Both: And to date, we've done
over $600,000 in sales.
Do you guys always talk
in stereo at home?
Do you guys talk in stereo?
?Like, do you two actually ??
?We're only 22 months apart,
so it's kind of ??
?Is there a mind meld
where you actually
talk together?
Greiner:
And it's super cute.
You're almost
like twins. I?I ??
Everyone thinks we're twins.
Everyone thinks we're twins.
What about this year?
That's just inception.
What about this year?
This year,
we've done, um, to date
$125,000 ??
$125,000 in sales.
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: Do you sell
entirely online,
or you're also
selling retail?
Both: No.
First, we did the, um,
test market online
at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
We passed that.
Then they put us in
20 doors, then 100 doors.
O'Leary: And they reordered?
?Yeah.
?And they kept reordering.
What ?? What other
big?box stores are you in?
We're ?? We just
got into Nordstrom,
Bed Bath,
Container Store.
Why have your sales
not blown up?
$125,000 for a great idea
like this
should be in the millions.
I mean, I don't understand.
So ?? So, we have not done
marketing or advertising yet.
We feel that we've done
these sales organically.
We were actually
in Oprah's magazine.
From there,
we were put on...
Both: "The View."
We sold 10,000 units.
So, right now,
we're at a break?even.
We ??
How much money
have you put in?
We raised
$360,000...
?Ooh.
?Whoa.
?Wow!
?...through friends and family.
?From friends and family.
And it was basically to help us
get off the ground
to buy our first
few rounds of inventory.
Did you sell them any
of the company for that?
So, we own around 84%
of the company.
Don't you think people are gonna
knock this off pretty fast?
So, we do have
two design patents.
We've already shut down
two copycats.
Cuban: Good for you.
You have? What did it
cost you to do that?
Both: Yes.
?It cost us about $10,000.
?I'm just curious.
They ?? It was
a smaller company ??
That's not bad, actually.
?To us, that's ?? that's bad.
?To us, it's bad.
Yeah, but it could
have been a lot worse.
O'Leary: How many more
have come back up?
So, right now, a very, very,
very large handbag company
came out with
a Handbag Raincoat,
and on their website,
they are calling it
the Handbag Raincoat.
?What?!
?No.
And it costs $650.
...$50.
Greiner: Whoa!
Cuban: Okay, so, guys,
what do you need
a Shark for?
We're really looking
for strategic partners
and growth capital.
We have
other ideas that ??
We have backpack raincoats
for backpacks...
Shoe covers.
...shoe covers.
We can expand on the brand
to fully own the rain.
This product is our blood,
sweat, and tears.
Our parents have really
supported us.
We're willing to do
whatever it takes
to make it work...
Cuban: No, you're not.
...'cause we know
it's gonna work.
I don't see that, guys.
I'm sorry. I'll ?? I'll be
brutally honest.
I don't see that you're willing
to do everything it takes.
I get the vision
and I get the goal,
but in the interim,
y?you've had all these ??
these peaks where
you've had opportunity,
and it hasn't
really translated.
You're hoping
something triggers
so that the pull?through
is there.
And when you're hoping
for that
as opposed to controlling
your own destiny,
that's why it's been
challenging.
And for those reasons,
I'm out,
but I wish you guys the best.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Cuban: I want to tell you
the way I'm seeing it.
You said you had no marketing
or advertising,
which was a plus.
?Correct.
I see that as a negative
because marketing
and advertising is gonna be
one of your most major expenses
you're gonna have to encounter
if you're gonna grow
this business.
You said that you had
a potential lawsuit.
You've spent $10,000 so far.
That's nothing
compared to what you're gonna
have to do to stop a giant.
I'm out.
Listen, I see
so many similarities
from my journey
with you guys.
I was knocked off
by a lot of big guys
right when I came out.
I had a patent on my product.
I chose to keep inventing
and coming out with
the next best product,
but it's
a personal decision.
I chose not to sue and
not to go after everybody.
Based on how much I would use
the product myself,
which is part of what
I like to invest in,
I'm out,
but I wish you guys
great success.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, let me give it
to you by the numbers.
Love numbers.
This business is not worth
$1.2 million.
You overvalued yourself
by a factor of 10 times.
I was intrigued by the fact that
a behemoth knocked you off
because I know how to fix those
problems very quickly, but ??
?Help us solve that.
?No, but ??
I love to pour money
on the gasoline of sales,
not litigation.
I know how to fix it,
but that's not a great place
to build value.
You're not gonna stay
on the shelves of retail
with $125,000 in sales.
Sorry to have to give you
the bad news.
The stereo stuff, all that,
I love it,
but the numbers ??
?So, help us out.
The numbers tell the truth,
and, honestly, I can't ??
We'll make you proud.
We will.
There's just no way
to make money with you.
I'm out.
So, I think the umbrella
is why you haven't sold more.
If you have an umbrella,
it's protecting everything,
including the purse.
It's cute, it's kitschy.
?Lori, offer us a deal.
?I?I don't ??
I feel so bad 'cause
I adore both of you.
I'd hire both of you.
?[ Laughs ]
But on this product,
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Sorry, guys.
Blakely: Thank you, guys.
Congratulations on
what you've accomplished.
Thank you.
?Can we just say to them
"good luck"
in unison?
One, two,
three.
All: Good luck.
?[ Laughing ] Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?See you, guys.
?Bye.
?Bye.
