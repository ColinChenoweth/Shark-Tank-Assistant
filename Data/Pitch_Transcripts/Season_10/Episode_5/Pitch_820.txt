Hi, Sharks.
My name is Jon Hayes,
I'm from
Raleigh, North Carolina,
and I'm seeking $200,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company, RewardStock.
Sharks, frequent?flier miles
and other travel reward points
are so hard to use.
Most of us get frustrated trying
to find a good deal
or, worse yet,
ignore points altogether
because it's just
too much work.
At least it used to be
until now.
When my wife and I got married,
we took an amazing honeymoon.
We flew first class
to the Maldives
and stayed for eight nights
in a $1,000?a?night
over?the?water villa.
We got over $40,000
worth of travel
for just 200 bucks in cash.
?Wow.
?That's right. How, you ask?
By strategically using
our frequent?flier miles
to pay for almost
the entire trip.
And that's when RewardStock
was born.
RewardStock is your automated
reward travel advisor
and booking service,
and it's really easy to use.
Simply create a profile with
any points you already have,
and search
where you want to go.
RewardStock figures out
the best way
to use your points to get there.
Your next adventure could
start before you know it.
And just like that
[Snaps fingers]
you're in paradise.
[ Gasps ]
[ Drum rattles ]
[ Hula dancers shout ]
[ Laughs ]
?That's exactly right.
?Jon, what's your gross revenue?
Did you mention that?
?We launched our beta site,
uh, two years ago,
and in that time,
we've done
$50,000 in sales...
?Wow.
?That's it?
...on 10,000 users.
And in that testing period,
we've been a free platform.
We've just been gathering
feedback from users.
So, that is basically $5 a user
of pure referral revenue,
and we've actually
even considered
being a free platform
altogether
and focusing purely
on the referral revenue,
and ?? and that ??
that's exactly where ??
Jon, tell us about
your background, et cetera.
So, I mentioned
I'm from Raleigh.
I went
to Princeton University.
When I graduated,
I moved to Manhattan.
I did mergers and acquisitions
advisory for seven years.
O'Leary:
Now you're talking.
I was a top?ranked investment
banker the entire time.
Um...
Greiner: Good for you.
After this
amazing honeymoon...
[ Laughs ]
...I realized that there
was big opportunity here,
so I quit my job
on Wall Street.
I spent the next year
teaching myself
how to write code and building
the prototype for the site.
Jon, what are your biggest
business challenges
that you would see?
We're a four?person team
currently,
and we only have one
full?time programmer
in addition to myself.
That's our biggest bottleneck.
How much money have you spent
so far on your business,
and can you shed
some light
on how you get
to $4 million valuation?
I have personally invested
$20,000 of my own cash,
and we've raised $700,000
of additional capital.
?Wow.
?At what valuation on the 700K?
$3 1/2 million valuation cap
on a convertible note.
That was $400,000
in that note,
and that's how we get
to the $4 million valuation.
Jon, I have
to be passionate
about everything
that I invest in,
and this is
not my wheelhouse.
I'm gonna wish you
all the best,
but I'm out.
?Well, thank you.
Okay, I think ?? super smart,
what you're doing,
but I think it's just
too early
for me to feel comfortable
with my investment.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
You're still in search
of the perfect model...
Hmm.
...and that's gonna take
a lot of money,
and I think it's gonna take you
a while to get there.
$50,000 is not a lot of revenue,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
Uh, well, I appreciate
your time, Barbara.
Pleasure.
I'm interested 'cause it fits
right into some of my platform,
and, uh, we could add a
tremendous amount of value in ??
in kind of kicking this off,
but I'm not doing it for 5%.
No way. I just ?? I just
add too much value.
Hmm.
You got to get me to 10%
and I'll do it for 200K,
but I'm not
doing it for 5%.
You're not worth
4 million bucks right now.
Well, what I would say is ??
and I ?? and I described
how we got to our valuation
to begin with, right?
?I understand.
?Mm?hmm.
But none of your investors
have my platform.
Kevin, um...
I appreciate that offer.
Uh, let me
ask you, Mark,
what are you
thinking about this?
I?I'm gonna need
to get to 10%, as well.
Because at 5%, you're gonna need
me a lot more than I need you.
Um, part
of my concern on ??
on ?? in sensitivity
on valuation
is that I've got these
convertible notes that
are gonna convert
when I ?? when I do
this deal, right? So ??
I'm guessing
they have a discount.
Uh, 8%, yeah.
Okay, so, if I gave you
320K, 10%,
then ?? and you gave me
1% advisory share
just so I didn't give you
more money for nothing,
then you will overcome
your hurdle, right?
So, 320K, 10%,
1% advisory share.
We'll formulate it
so that it works within,
um, your note
when it converts.
