Hello, Sharks.
My name is Eben Dobson,
founder of WISP Industries.
And I want to introduce you
to the WISP,
a revolutionary
floor?cleaning system
that's in the process of
disrupting a category
that hasn't changed
in centuries ?? sweeping.
We have literally
re?engineered the broom
and the dustpan
from the bristles up,
making for a more efficient
and unique action
we call WISPing.
We all know what it's like to
use an old broom and a dustpan.
It requires two hands
and a side?by?side motion.
To use the pan,
you got to bend down...
It's true.
It's a pain.
...putting strain on your back
and your knees,
and we all know
what it takes
to get that
last pesky line of debris.
Well, no more.
[ Broom and dustpan clatter ]
[ Laughter ]
The WISP is intentionally
lightweight,
to be used with one hand
in a pulling motion.
The bristles are short, dense,
and 90 degrees to the floor
to create a perfect seal
to that surface.
The patented WISP pan
is amazing.
It literally allows you to apply
pressure with your foot.
Simply step
on the back, here,
and see how that creates
that perfect seal...
?Ah.
?...allowing you to easily
bring in that debris
effortlessly.
?That's smart.
?On the side of the pan
are combs that allow you
to clean that bristle.
?Wow.
?The evolution of sweeping
is WISPing.
That's why we're seeking
$500,000 for 10% of the company.
So, come on, Sharks.
?That's a lot of WISPing.
Who wants to join
Team WISP right now
and make sweeping changes
all across the world?
Have you sold
any of these things?
Yes, we've sold over
100,000 units to date.
?At how much apiece?
?We've done over $3.3 million
in sales, lifetime.
?Wow.
Is any of this
protected, or...?
?All of it.
?All of it.
Everything you look at
has a design patent
and utility patent,
as well.
So, what was
your profit last year?
Did not have
a profit last year.
Why not?
We had a loss due to two
very significant events
where it ate into our margin.
We were on a couple shows where
we had to do revenue share.
There was an inherent
marketing cost
to reach that many eyeballs.
So, you offer
your product at half price.
It's 50% off to the customer...
?Right.
...so, basically, if you have
a 50% markup on your product,
you make no money,
but you get
a lot of eyes
on your product.
We sold 20,000 units
in four hours.
?But at no profit.
?Very little.
O'Leary: But what about
the rest of the year?
What was your sales
last year?
?$1.43 million.
?You made no money on that?
We lost $600,000.
?Oh!
?Lost?!
?Wow.
?How'd you do that?
H?? That's hard to do.
That's not easy to do.
There was a lot of decisions
that I made,
and I take full responsibility
for it.
I had many people
that were on, um,
a consistent kind of
compensation schedules,
and I learned that
that was ??
when times were lean,
that that was a bad decision
on my half...
Employees?
?...and I've made those changes.
Well, if ??
Like sales reps and
distributor type things?
Yeah, and people that "market."
Eben, how much
have you invested,
and how much have you raised?
I've raised, uh,
close to $2 1/2 million
over six years.
They cut ?? Golf company ??
You've been doing this
six years? Wow.
So, we don't
even know ??
what does one cost,
and what does it cost to make?
The configuration
you're looking at right here
costs $29.95.
And our cost of goods
in '17, were $8.50.
O'Leary: So, the problem
is you're competing
with an $8.99 broom.
?Yes.
And how much do you have
in inventory there?
We have about $300,000.
Why did you buy
so much inventory?
In 2016, we went viral
to over 110 million views,
and we sold out like that.
[ Snaps fingers ]
So, instantaneously, I went,
"We need more inventory."
We brought it in.
?You got caught up.
Because it took time,
all of our search and exposure
started dissipating,
and we had to start that
back up again.
So we did another event,
and we keep doing
this roller coaster.
What we're looking at,
with your help,
would be to bring in a more
consistent, economical way
to create a supply chain,
and then really go after
what we believe
is our online edge.
Okay, so what are
your cumulative losses
since the beginning
of inception?
Like, what ?? How much have you
lost in these years total?
He's raised
$2.5 million.
Does that mean
you've lost $2.5 million?
Do you have any money left?
We have about $50,000.
but they've discovered that Eben
is over $2 million in debt
for his broom business, WISP.
Effectively, you're down
$2 million.
More. $2.1 million
in the hole.
Well, I don't believe
I'm doing a really good job
of painting
the exact picture because...
[ Chuckles ]
You think?
?Well, but ??
?...um...we ?? we know
that the products will sell,
and what I'm here for
is to ?? is to, uh ??
I've made mistakes,
and I've ??
I think you get
an "A" for effort
and an "F"
for execution.
And I think
you know that.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Look, the product
clearly works.
I mean, that's
the intriguing part.
But in year after
year after year,
you've made no money.
That's very depressing.
And so, the question is,
do you need
adult supervision
so that you get focused
on one thing?
'Cause there must be somebody
that wants a broom that works.
It's just,
how do you find them?
It's why I'm here.
It's why I'm here.
Because I've been punched
for three?plus years,
and ?? and, um, I've been
working off instinct to go,
uh, and optimize,
uh, cost of goods ??
But where did you raise
the $2.5 million from?
Well, from, um,
my network. Uh...
And nobody has come in
since then saying,
"What the hell
is going on?"
Well, um...
"Let me take over.
Let me give you some help."
?...I never raised enough money
to really
drive the business.
I always did it
project?based,
and it's been
a long time coming.
We did a ??
?It's $2.5 million.
Each one of us started
$100 million?plus businesses
with thousands
of dollars.
Look, we all make mistakes
as entrepreneurs,
but I just
really don't think
you have your act
together on this.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
Eben, I have
this theory.
When you're first starting
a business, make it, sell it.
Make it, sell it.
I feel like you've spent
a lot more money
maybe than you
needed to.
And I would take
a hard look at that.
One of the things that
I say to people is,
"As soon as you can afford to,
hire your weaknesses."
Your contribution
to this
feels like it should be
more in the product side...
?Mm?hmm.
?...and I would encourage you
to get support on
the marketing/sales side
so that you can really focus
on the part of the business
that I can feel
is your strength.
?Okay.
?And I like your product.
I'm gonna buy
your product, actually,
but I'm not gonna invest
in your company today.
So, I'm out.
Thank you.
Innovation
requires education.
Eben,
it's a great product.
It needs
to be demonstrated.
It's been
a very rocky road.
You certainly need a partner
to be your mirror image
and do all the things
you don't do well.
You have some weaknesses
in executional skills
when it comes to business.
Not everybody does it well.
?I admit it.
?That's why they partner.
Mm?hmm.
?You desperately need a partner.
?Yes.
Someone with executional skills
and certain disciplines
about how money is spent.
That person's
Mr. Wonderful.
So, if you
want $500,000,
I'll do it, but I want 50% ??
not 51%, 50%
'cause that's
a lot of money.
I don't like
losing $500,000.
I don't do that ever.
?Right.
But do you have debt
on the company, too?
Very little,
comparatively.
?How much?
?$250,000.
Oh.
[ Laughing ] I knew
where that was going.
?This story...
?Gets longer.
Well, I don't ??
I don't know
if you can sell me
50% of the company.
Who owns it?
Well, I have, uh ??
I have, uh...
22 investors...
?Wow.
?...that have been through ??
?22?
Yeah, it's been
a long road of ??
?Oh...
?I feel like I'm at a wake.
Honestly, I don't think
I've ever sat here
where I felt like something
really took my breath away.
Oh, my goodness.
I mean, I just
was like, "Whoa."
It's like
a punch to the gut.
You have so much debt,
and you've lost so much money.
?What are you gonna do?
?How do you recommend
I get out of this and ??
and fight for it?
More things as the onion
keeps unpeeling.
I mean, there's got
to be a chance ??
Cuban: You need
somebody who ??
who's just
a killer salesperson.
Look, Eben, I'll put up
the $500,000,
but one way or another, I'm
ending up as a 50/50 partner.
Now, if your 22 investors
don't like that outcome,
they don't like it
because they're not here,
but you are.
Right.
So I'm gonna make you
that offer.
If you're willing to accept it,
let's go to work.
There's a lot of work ??
And he's not interested
in doing anything
to bring me in
to help you sell it,
so I'm out.
Well, Lori, I can
discuss that later.
She's out. Okay. Look, maybe
we'll work with Lori later,
but right now,
you need $500,000.
She's not willing
to put up a cent.
I am. I'll put up
the $500,000,
but I got to end up with 50%.
Yes or no, Eben?
What do you
want to do?
But why wouldn't you
not want to include Lori?
I might, but she's not putting
up any money right now,
so I'm not
worried about it.
I think you need me.
Eben, if you want to do
a deal with Lori,
do a deal with Lori.
She has no money for this deal.
What do you want to do?
This is your moment.
Yes or no?
I really think that ??
?That's it, Eben. I'm out.
?Oh!
?Get out of there.
I'm gone.
I'm an investor.
Okay.
I had the $500,000.
It was in your hand,
and you're talking to her?
You're out of here.
See ya, buddy.
?Goodbye. Take your broom.
?Good luck, Eben.
?Bye, Eben.
?Oh.
Kevin's offer was amazing,
but I don't believe
that I have the ability
to make that decision
that quickly.
That could have gone better.
But the truth of the matter is,
is that I'm not
going anywhere.
The WISP is still
gonna be available.
Now he's made three mistakes
to the next potential investor.
That was too tough.
I'm sorry.
That was so painful.
Honestly, I should have
never had anything ??
I'm s?? Are you
out of your mind?!
That was too tough
for that man.
I'm going up there
to shake his hand,
and he's still
talking to ??
Too mean.
You know why?
Oh, I'm "too mean"?
Oh, God, I feel terrible.
No, no. No, you know why?
Because ?? No.
He's not a businessman.
?Wait, wait, let me cry.
