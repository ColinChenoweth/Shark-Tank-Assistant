Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kate Field,
and I'm from
Madison, Wisconsin.
Today, I'm seeking $350,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Now, Sharks, I'd like
to introduce to you
your new best friend.
The SCOBY!
?What?
?What?!
Blakely:
[ Laughs ] Oh, my gosh.
Okay.
I know it looks
a little gross...
?It does.
?[ Laughs ]
...but what if I told you
that this right here
is the key ingredient
to the fastest?growing
beverage in the country?
?It looks like a kidney.
?Ew.
?[ Laughs ]
?Yep.
If you haven't guessed it
already,
I'm talking about
the wildly popular drink,
kombucha.
Filled with
healthy probiotics,
kombucha is a fizzy,
low?sugar, fermented tea
with an addictingly
delicious taste
that consumers just
can't get enough of.
The problem is,
most kombucha in stores
costs a whopping
$3 to $5 per bottle.
And with ingredients like this,
brewing kombucha at home can
seem like an intimidating task.
So, that's why I started
The Kombucha Shop.
Greiner: Wow.
So, Kate, I'd love
to see how it works.
Basically, what you do is
you're gonna make sweet tea,
then you're gonna open up
that SCOBY pouch,
and you're gonna
pour it in.
So, you can see that little
SCOBY's down in the bottom.
You're gonna put
the cotton cover on top of it.
You'll follow
the instructions.
There's pH strips.
You'll do a little test,
you'll put a temperature gauge
on the side,
and then it's gonna just
sit on your kitchen counter
for approximately
10 days,
and the fermentation
is complete.
So, you're obviously
selling a lot...
Yes.
...and doing great.
What do you need
the money for?
So, I'm here for a strategic
partner to scale.
I've brought this company
as far as I can on my own.
I've been a one?woman show
this whole time.
What I've learned is that
I don't know what I don't know.
I crush it online, and I've
learned everything that I can,
but I don't know retail.
It's a market that I don't
have access to right now,
and I know where my customers ??
?Well, what ?? what ??
what's your dream retailer?
Where would you
want to sell this?
Whole Foods.
Those boxes take up a tremendous
amount of shelf space.
That's why I stacked
these here 'cause this
is how I pictured this.
You go into
Whole Foods, right?
They do tons
of these little products
that are sitting in
the middle of the aisle.
Kate, have you tried to ??
You didn't give us
some numbers on your cost
and what you sell it
for, did you?
So, this kit right here
is $11 to make.
We sell it retail
for $45.
The deluxe kit is $23.
We sell that for $75.
Kate, I got bad news.
These are barely enough margins
to play
in the retail space,
considering they won't
pay you for 60 days.
I mean, you've got such
an amazing business.
Let's go back to
the business you have.
$1.7 million this year.
What are you gonna make
after you pay yourself?
Just over $500,000.
?Wow!
After you ??
After you pay yourself?
Wow.
Why screw that up?
Greiner: Amazing.
That's after
I pay myself.
What does it cost you to acquire
a customer ?? a new customer?
Currently zero. I've never
put any money into advertising.
Yay!
[ Laughter ]
Okay, so, you're
gonna make $500,000
after you've paid all
your staff and yourself.
Yes.
So, we're gonna pay some tax
on that this year.
So, you're gonna have
$300,000 left
when that's all done,
which is great.
Yeah.
But because it's not
proprietary or protectable
and all that stuff, you have
to start thinking
about what multiple
as an investor
would I pay on $300,000?
?Oh, Kevin.
Just ignore everything coming
from his mouth going forward.
But wait ?? But I want to give
it to you anyways.
Well, it's a good point.
It's not ??
Obviously,
I can't make a kit.
It's not proprietary, but ??
?No, I get it. I get it.
But I'm just saying ?? $300,000
this year after taxes.
That's great.
?Yeah.
I'm not gonna offer you
12 multiple on that.
I'm gonna offer you
half of that.
I'll give you
$350,000 for 20%.
Let the bidding begin.
Okay, so,
I like to be
really into, like, the products
that I invest in...
?I know.
?...because it makes me excited.
I'm just not
a kombucha fan myself.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Kate, when I invest
in someone,
I like to really understand
what value I am adding,
and I'm still
unclear on that.
When we asked you why you need
the support and the money,
you said,
"To go to retail."
Your margins right now
don't really support retail,
and you're doing so great
in direct marketing.
So, I'm struggling with
why you wouldn't
just continue to do this
by yourself.
So, I don't see retail
as being a huge distraction.
It see it as an additional,
helpful piece,
and I really see it ??
I mean, have you called
Whole ?? Whole Foods?
I've talked ?? I've ??
I've talked with a few buyers,
and they've ?? It ends up
being the runaround of,
you know, "Oh, yeah,
we got your product,"
and six months later ??
?So, Kate,
giving up a lot of equity for us
to call Whole Foods for you ??
So, I'm here because
I want to blitz.
Competitors are coming.
There's new ones on Amazon...
?Yeah.
?...every month.
And so, yes...
Feel ?? Yeah, you feel
threatened.
...I can keep waiting
for them to call me back,
but they don't, and it could be
18 months, 24 more months
before I'm in six or seven
regions of Whole Foods,
and I want to go like fast.
?Hey, I'm not gonna ??
I'm not gonna buy 10%
of your company
so I can make a phone call
for you to Whole Foods.
I want you to stay the course,
keep doing what you're doing.
Sara ??
Okay, so...
Kate has one offer
on the table from Kevin
for her kombucha?making?kit
business,
The Kombucha Shop.
I'm not gonna buy 10%
of your company
so I can make a phone call
for you to Whole Foods.
I want you to stay the course,
keep doing what you're doing.
Sara ?? Okay, so...
And?
Corcoran:
Wait, wait, Sara.
Why don't I
just make a deal
and if you'd like to join me,
you're more than welcome.
Okay.
But not Mr. Wonderful, of
course, 'cause he's obnoxious.
[ Laughs ]
You're gonna overpay.
I'm not gonna join you.
I'm not
gonna overpay.
Sure you are.
Watch ?? Watch this.
All right, well, what are you
thinking, Barbara?
What are you thinking?
?Watch this.
A couple of things.
First of all,
there's a lot of things that
you're not even mentioning
that I'm noticing that makes you
a dream entrepreneur.
You're a great designer.
?Thank you.
That is so adorable,
every little piece.
You're so specific...
Yes. Very true.
[ Laughs ]
...on detail,
but yet, you're phenomenal
at the big picture.
Thank you.
The thing
you're not utilizing
is that gorgeous face
of yours.
Oh, God!
Are you aware
that you're probably
the healthiest?looking person
I've ever seen
in my entire life?
Yeah, I was gonna say
the same thing.
[ Laughs ]
You're a poster child
for this.
[ Laughs ]
If I could be as
healthy?looking as you,
I would swallow this horrible
stuff every day of my life.
?[ Laughs ]
?I was thinking the same thing.
Barbara, start drinking
kombucha.
?Your skin, your hair.
?I'm telling you! It ?? It's ??
So, Barbara, how much
are you gonna overpay?
I'm gonna give you
$200,000 in cash,
$150,000
in a credit line,
if you need more than
that in a credit line,
no issue,
based on orders ??
for the 10%,
what you're asking.
So, if you'd
entertain that offer,
I would love
to be your partner.
Hold on, hold on.
Barbara, I will split
the deal with you.
?Okay.
?And you'll get both of us
for what
you're asking for.
?Wait, so, wait, wait, wait.
?I'm gonna take that deal.
Yay!
?Aww.
?Oh, my God!
?Congratulations!
?Thank you.
?Yes. This is great.
?Congrats.
I'm gonna make this
at home tonight.
I can't believe it.
