Cranny: Hello, Sharks.
My name's Jeff Cranny.
I'm seeking $200,000
for a 20% equity
in my company, Lockstraps.
Sharks, theft can happen
to anyone anywhere at any time.
Maybe you're into desert sports,
like dirt bikes, quads, or UTVs.
Or maybe you're more into
the water?sports kind of thing.
Big or small,
Lockstraps locks it all.
They have a stainless steel
cable embedded inside the strap
with two durable
combination?locking carabiners
on both ends of the straps,
making them
almost impossible to cut.
Sharks, we have
a saying around here.
Lockstraps are kind of
like jock straps.
They help protect your junk.

Oh, my goodness.
ARod, you look pretty strong.
Why don't you come up here
Cranny: Yeah, actually,
I have samples for you guys.
Cuban: Great.
But, Jeff, are you selling it
now in Home Depot?
Not the bad product.
?This one. This isn't bad.
?Yes. Yes. Those are ??
How well are they selling?
Yeah, those are still
being sold at Home Depot.
How are they selling?
How are they selling?
What they did is, as you know,
they bring the price down
from what it was.
But how well
are they selling?
Jeff, my money's on first,
but he's on third.
I'm out. Good luck.
Thank you.
Jeff, I can relate
with your story because,
you know, I played 23 years
in the major leagues.
Yes.
I'm fifth all?time
in the history
of the game in strikeouts.
Mm?hmm.
That means I have a PhD
at failing.
At failing.
But I also have a ??
a master's at getting back up.
That's what
I'm trying to do.
But what I was hoping, when you
get a second bite at the apple,
