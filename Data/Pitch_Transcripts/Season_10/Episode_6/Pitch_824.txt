Hi, Sharks.
We are Joe and Megan Johnson.
And we're from
East Lansing, Michigan.
We're seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company,
Vade Nutrition.
is a part of Joe's
everyday life.

[ Laughter ]
And afterwards,
he always opens up
a fresh tub
of protein powder...
[ Both exhale deeply ]
...only to realize he can't
find the scooper anywhere.
[ Groans ]
[ Laughter ]
And then when
he finally finds it,
now he always has to worry
about measuring
and scooping
without making a mess.
[ Laughter ]
This is definitely
not convenient.
And if he wants to take
his protein on the go,
he usually has to worry
about measuring it
into a little
plastic baggie
and then praying that it doesn't
bust open in his gym bag.
Stop the madness!
And that's when...
Pow!
...it hit us!
Dissolvable protein scoops,
baby!
That's right. This is a full
serving of protein powder
wrapped in a food?grade,
edible film
that dissolves instantly
when shaken or blended in water,
milk,
or your favorite drink.
It's as easy as toss it in,
shake it up...
?Thanks, Joe.
?There you go.
?You're welcome.
?Awesome.
?Thank you.
?You're welcome.
?Thank you so much.
?Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you very much.
?You're welcome.
Greiner:
I like that the chocolate's
the same calories
as the vanilla.
?Yes.
?Never happens.
[ Laughter ]
Right?
Right.
Guys, what is the actual,
uh, package
that is wrapping
the protein powder made out of?
'Cause I'm gonna drink that,
too, when it dissolves.
It's made of 100% food?grade
ingredients.
The main ingredient is used
to coat vitamins and pills,
and all the rest
are food?binding agents.
This ?? This ?? This ??
It looks like plastic.
It does look like plastic,
but it's totally edible, safe.
Shake it up, and you'll see
the film dissolves instantly.
?You usually put a little ice?
?Yeah, you can put ??
You can put ice in it.
You can do ice.
A lot of people make them
with smoothies.
You can use milk, water,
some people put
the vanilla in some juice.
See, Mark knows how to shake it.
[ Laughs ]
What's nice is no sugar.
Yep, zero sugar.
Yes, absolutely.
How many calories in this?
90 calories in a serving.
I don't drink protein powders,
so educate me a little bit.
Is 90 calories on par
with typical protein powders?
It's very lean.
It's very lean.
It's actually ??
Yes, very lean.
So, our protein is 100%
whey isolate,
one of the leanest proteins
there are on the market.
There's only 2 carbs,
1 gram of fat, and 0 sugar.
Do they all taste this bad?
We've actually been told
that we have one of
the best?tasting
protein powders.
?I love it.
?This is relative.
?It's all relative.
?I love it.
Yeah, everyone
has different tastes.
This great.
I love it. I've never really ??
I never took protein...
Yes.
...before we started this.
Oh, my God. I might become,
like, a protein ??
How much protein
in each serving?
20 grams.
20 grams of protein
per serving.
Can you guys tell us a little
bit about your background?
I went to school
at Michigan State.
Um, I got my degree
in finance there.
And during that time,
I wrestled.
And it was in college
that I met Megan,
who has also been
an athlete her whole life.
I was a gymnast
most of my life,
and we met at a summer camp
in Colorado
for college athletes.
Shortly after that,
I moved to Michigan
to start our life together,
get married,
and we have
a 2?year?old little boy.
All right. How much you selling?
Who's manufacturing?
What does it cost?
What are your gross margins?
Give us all of that.
Yep, absolutely.
So, we only started selling
product in July of 2017.
What we've been doing
is testing the market
because it's a completely
different product
than anything
this industry has seen.
And so up from ??
Is it different only
because it's a different
delivery system, in a packet?
Absolutely, yep.
Yep.
That's your point
of difference.
Both: Yes.
The biggest innovation in ??
really, in any type
of food right now
is convenient packaging
mechanisms, especially ??
Do you have a patent
on that execution?
Patent pending.
Yes.
Cuban:
What's unique about
what you're doing
that makes it protectable?
It's a utility patent
on any consumable powder
that's wrapped entirely
by another consumable container.
Greiner: Really?
Megan: Yep.
Both of which are meant
to be consumed
at the exact same time
after being dissolved
in a water?based liquid.
How's the pricing work?
If I'm somebody
who usually buys
the big gallon jar,
am I paying a significant
premium to do it
in small packs like this?
No, you're actually not.
And so, with a whey isolate,
the price is usually
between $1.20 and $2 a serving,
and we're
about $1.50 a serving.
What are your revenues
annually?
We've done $80,000.
$30,000 of that has come
in the past month.
Was any of that
Kickstarter?
None of that was Kickstarter.
No, it was not.
Okay, so where are you
selling through?
Online on our website,
as well as Amazon,
and then some other
online retailers.
We went to a fitness expo
to launch the product.
We were ready to, you know,
get some online orders,
maybe even ship
some product to the expo.
We had put about $50,000
towards the powder,
and then they sent
the protein powder
to get all packaged,
and it was wrong.
They had flavored it
incorrectly,
they refused to give us
our money back,
and this was our launch,
so it was really ??
Welcome to being
an entrepreneur.
Poo?poo happens, doesn't it?
Yeah, it was ?? Yeah, it does.
[ Chuckles ]
Okay, so the majority of costs
for the whole industry
are marketing
and customer acquisition.
Yep, absolutely.
Because the margins
are crazy high, like 82%, 85%,
but they spend half
of their income marketing.
What are you gonna do
to get customers?
So, one of the really,
really cool things
that we're extremely excited
about is social media
because we haven't been
paying for social media,
but over a quarter
of our traffic to our website
has been from social media
because
people love to grab these.
To show it off.
The fitness Instagram
and the fitness industry is...
So you're gonna stay online
and try and acquire customers,
getting the buzz,
blogs, everything else?
Both: Yeah.
Because to get the shelf space
in the supplement aisle...
Yeah.
...whether ??
whether it's in a drug store
or whether it's in
a nutritional retailer,
that's nearly impossible.
They don't give up shelf space.
?Yeah, but that's
not your home run.
?Yeah.
?Right.
?People aren't walking
into a drug store.
Right.
Right, your ??
your home run comes
from licensing more
than anything else and
expanding it to new products.
Correct.
Both: Mm?hmm. Yeah.
You know, because this ??
this is where
you're testing it, right?
Yeah.
This is your
proof of concept.
Mm?hmm.
It's everything else that you're
gonna make a lot of money off.
Right.
Corcoran: I have a question.
The only money you've made
is $60,000, did you say?
$80,000.
We've made $80,000.
We had a lot of ??
Doesn't strike me
like a lot of money at all
for the time
you've been a business.
Yeah, it ?? it absolutely ??
Mm?hmm.
So, we spent $300,000
on inventory...
Cuban: Ooh.
...and a lot of that has ??
has gone away because of...
We have minimums that
we have to, you know, order.
Is that because of
the problems you had?
It's because of the problems
we had, yeah.
Yeah.
So some of it got burned.
It's tough, you know,
but we've gotten this far.
You know,
leading up to the January
when we really started
making sales, there was times
when it was like, "We might
have to shut this down."
Cuban: Okay, so, where you guys
are at, when you ??
when you're grinding and
your back is against the wall,
you take the path of
least resistance to cash, right?
Yep.
Mm?hmm.
And so on ?? on one hand,
you have a patent...
Mm?hmm.
...and that's your kind ??
that's your hammer, right?
Yeah.
You're getting ready to use.
Your hammer is more important
than everything else
right now, right?
Yeah.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
Okay.
Right, and I think
where I can really
deliver value
is to keep you from making
these mistakes, right...
Yeah, absolutely.
...because everything
you're looking at
is spend some cash
to make some cash.
So I'd need more than 10%,
so what I'll do is
I'll offer you $350,000 for 20%.
What do you guys think?
Yeah.
That's a good offer.
I love ?? I love that offer.
So is that a yes?
You want to hear what I think?
I'd like to...
Are we able to hear
from the other Sharks, please?
I might not be here, guys.
I ?? I see the value.
But I'm not gonna guarantee
I'll be here.
Megan:
We started with nothing,
and we had this dream
to get on "Shark Tank"...
Yes!
...and pitch our business
to the Sharks
and just this huge goal
that we wanted to reach
with our company,
and now we've done it, and
so this is literally shocking.
I can't believe it,
and it's amazing.
It means the world to us.
We got a deal!
