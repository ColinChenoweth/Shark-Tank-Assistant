Hey, Sharks.
My name is Kristoffer.
And I'm Victor, and we are
the founders of Nui!
Nui!
Where we make saying "no"
to sugar ridiculously easy,
tasty, and fun.
And today we are seeking
$300,000 for 10% of our company.
So, a couple years ago,
our lives were changed forever.
Victor and I
cut out the sugar
and went on a low?carb
ketogenic diet,
and it was amazing.
I stopped napping.
And I lost over 40 pounds.
We felt invincible ??
that is,
until we had to face
our sugar cravings.
Sugar was everywhere.
It was in donuts, in brownies,
and even
in our biggest weakness...
Both: Cookies!
So instead of caving in,
we go to my mom's kitchen,
and with no baking experience,
created Nui,
a super?yummy cookie
with only one gram of sugar.
Nui cookies are a delicious
and nutritious harmony
of almonds and good fats,
like coconut oil
and grass?fed butter.
You can eat this whole box
of Nui cookies
and still consume less sugar
than one traditional cookie.
Wow.
We use a proprietary blend
of natural sweeteners
that taste just like sugar,
but without all
the sugary consequences.
So, Sharks, will you help us
make the world...
Both:
A butter place?
?Can we taste it?
?Of course, yeah.
Yes. Absolutely.
That's how we bribe you.
?Bring on the Nui.
?Yeah.
This is for you, Mark.
Thanks, Victor.
That's for you, Lori.
Thank you.
And for you,
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
?Oh.
?Ooh, it looks good.
?Appreciate it.
?Yes.
?Mm, smells great.
?Not bad.
Delicious.
How many carbs
in this cookie?
There are two grams
of net carbs per cookie.
Wow.
What am I eating here? Sand?
[ Laughter ]
So, we use almond flour,
and we sweeten it
with natural sweeteners, uh,
monk fruit and erythritol.
How many calories in this?
If it's just one cookie
individual,
I'd say
about 140 calories.
Any protein in here?
Uh, six grams of protein
per serving.
Nice.
We have a lot of traction.
Over the last 12 months,
we have sold $1.1 million
worth of cookies.
?Whoa.
?Good for you guys.
How? How did you find
your customers?
So, we reached out
on social media to people
that were influential
in the ketogenic space,
which is growing
very rapidly.
Can we get a little bit
about both of your backgrounds?
Yeah, so, uh, my parents
immigrated here from Mexico,
and I feel like I've been
an entrepreneur my whole life.
In kindergarten,
I bought big bags of candy.
I sold the individual pieces
door?to?door
as a way to make money.
In junior high, I started
a lawn?mowing company.
I became the first
person in my family to
ever graduate from college.
Good for you.
So, my parents came here
from the Philippines,
and I remember my dad
used to work four jobs
just to put food on the table.
Wow.
And he really taught me
what hard work really means.
And my mom,
she used to tell me,
"If you don't like something,
don't complain.
Change it."
So, guys, those sales numbers
are impressive.
You gonna tell us
how you did it?
Yeah, so, it's all been
through our website.
We're not even on Amazon yet.
So we're not even on Amazon yet,
which we are launching
this month,
and we're expecting our sales
to double or triple.
Are you making these
in a commercial kitchen now?
We've moved to a co?packer
recently.
Finally.
Part of the challenge this year
has been being
able to meet the demand.
We sold $630,000
year to date.
Half of those six months,
we have been sold out.
Can you give us
the numbers on it?
So, we sell them
for $29.95 ??
Can we get a couple
of boxes to look at?
?Yeah.
?Yeah, thanks.
We sell them for $29.95
plus $4.95 shipping.
Wow, expensive.
Um...
Cuban:
For how many cookies?
Each box has 10 packs.
Each pack has 2 cookies.
So 20 cookies.
So it's 20 cookies.
What are the margins on this?
What do you make them for?
Depending on the flavor,
between $11 and $13.
That's the best price
that you could get it down to?
O?Our goal this year is
to get to 75% gross margin.
Part of it is, we're looking
to hire someone in operations
that has great relationships
with supply partners
as well as, uh,
manufacturing partners.
Guys, can you get this down
to 6 bucks in cost?
That's the goal.
That's the goal.
So, yeah.
'Cause you can't go into retail
if ?? if you're spending
more than $6 making this.
Yes.
And one of our challenges
has been cash
to be able to buy inventory
to be able to buy at the volume
needed to be able to
reduce the cost.
Over the last 12 months,
tell me how much you've netted.
Profit.
Our net, if we're counting
the last 12 months, is $35,000.
O'Leary: What is your
average cost, $12.50?
Yeah.
Right.
So you're basically making
about 11% of profit.
But our customer
lifetime value is, uh ??
?Do they reorder?
?Oh, yeah.
?Yes, they do.
What ?? What evidence
do you have of that?
Uh, we have data,
'cause it's all e?commerce.
Guys, I?I'm gonna
clear the deck,
because one of my companies,
Alyssa's Healthy Cookies,
which is low calorie,
low net carbs.
I don't know that we compete
or not compete,
but it's just not a deal
I can do,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Totally understand that.
Guys, I like
what you're doing.
I just can't get close
to your valuation.
So I will respectfully go out.
Thank you.
Appreciate your time.
So, I happen to know a woman
that loves cookies,
and I mean loves.
Jennifer eats a cookie every
night before she goes to bed,
but I?I?I'm trying to get,
still,
into this valuation, Kevin.
?It's incredible.
?I wonder how you get there.
Here's the solution.
'Cause I want to ??
Yeah, tell me, Kevin.
Here's the solution.
Rather than fight
about valuation,
'cause you're gonna have
a hell of a fight,
I'll make you the same offer
I made Wicked Good Cupcakes
when they stood
exactly where you were,
and they have
become multimillionaires.
Here's how it works.
It's a dollar a sale ??
that's the royalty on it ??
until I get my $300,000 back,
then it drops to 45 cents
in perpetuity,
and I get 2.5% equity just to be
a partner and stay motivated.
I'll never pay you
a $3 million valuation now,
nor will any other Shark,
but it doesn't mean
you don't have a great business.
That's the solution.
Align our interests.
There's an offer.
We appreciate the offer.
We'd like to respect
the other folks, as well.
I'll give you an offer.
I'll give you the $300,000.
$150,000 in cash,
$150,000 in a credit line.
I want 50 cents for each box
of cookies you sell,
and I want 15% equity.
Ouch!
This is a deal that I would
really be excited about.
Kristoffer and Victor
have three offers
on the table
for their cookie company, Nui.
Kevin offered $300,000
for a 2.5% stake
with a dollar royalty,
which reduces to 45 cents,
Barbara offered $150,000
plus a $150,000 line of credit
for 15% and a 50?cent royalty,
while Alex offered $300,000
for 25%.
I've been looking at the space
of cookies
now for a while.
Okay.
And it's something
that we've been wanting
to take wide really quickly,
and we're thinking
direct?to?consumer
is the best process.
I get two young entrepreneurs
I believe in,
but more importantly
is what you guys can inherit
and the position
I'm gonna put you in.
