Hi, I'm Adam Callinan.
And I'm Matt Campbell.
Alex and Kevin have offered
Matt and Adam $500,000
plus a $500,000 line
of credit for a 20% stake
in their insulated
bottle holder,
BottleKeeper, but Lori
also seems interested.
Do you have an offer?
Callinan: Offers start coming,
and then complicated offers.
It was a lot more of an intense
negotiation than I expected.
Sure. It's the Shark Tank,
right?
Congrats.
Your first royalty deal.
No, not my first.
You've learned from the master.
If the investment goes bad,
you can always drink it away.
?Cheers.
?Cheers.
