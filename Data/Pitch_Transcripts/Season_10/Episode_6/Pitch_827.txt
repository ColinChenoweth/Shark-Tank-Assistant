Hi, I'm Adam Callinan.
And I'm Matt Campbell.
We're cousins, best friends,
and the founders of BottleKeeper
based out of
El Segundo, California.
We're seeking
a $1 million investment
in exchange for 5%
of our company.
?Wow!
?Wow!
?Hello!
There is an epidemic
that has been plaguing the world
for centuries,
maybe even decades.
[ Chuckles ]
It won't stop,
and with global warming,
it's only getting worse.
This epidemic is, of course,
warm beer.
[ Chuckles ]
But there's no need to fret,
because we have
just the solution.
It was on a warm
but fateful summer day
that I was trying to enjoy
a beer from a red party cup,
and it was hot in minutes,
and just terrible.
And then it hit me.
Why can't I put a beer bottle
inside of one of those
stainless steel bottles
that are used
to keep water cold?
So I did just that,
and BottleKeeper was born.
?One, two, three.
?Reveal!
[ Laughs ]
BottleKeeper is an innovative
stainless steel bottle
that's insulated
with neoprene
so you can take
your cold beer bottle,
insert it,
lock on the base,
use this fancy?schmancy
bottle opener
that's built into the top,
noting that the inside
also seals that inner bottle,
and enjoy.
?Wow.
?That's cool.
Now, which of you
cold?beer?loving Sharks
are gonna help us take a stand
against the warm?beer epidemic
that has been plaguing
the world for centuries?
But first, let's loosen you
Sharks up with some beers.
?Done. Let's go.
?Smart man.
?Yeah, cold!
?[ Laughs ]
?Good.
?Blue one for you.
?Thank you, sir.
?Black one for you.
Thank you.
I like the opener.
We talked about
the cold function
that BottleKeeper adds, but what
we didn't talk about is the fact
that that bottle really helps
to protect that inner bottle
so when you're at the pool
and you drop your glass beer,
it doesn't explode
all over your feet.
So we created a little demo.
We're gonna have one of you
cold?beer?loving Sharks
come up here and throw this hard
ball at that lineup of loaded
BottleKeepers,
and today we're in luck
because we happen
to have 14?time
All Star, World Series
Champion in the house.
I know. I know.
?Ohh, wah.
Come right back
and give it a wing.
Drill 'em.
?Just hit 'em.
?Perfect.
?Wow.
?Dead center.
?Dead center.
?See, not bad.
?You did win a World Series.
Here you go, Alex.
You win your carnival prize.
?You can't do better
than dead center.
?Wow.
With a "Warm Beer Hater"
T?shirt.
My ?? My ?? My daughters
would love this.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you. I like that.
That is not what I expected you
to give him.
So, now we, uh...
and, we are ??
Yeah, we're good.
Oh, that's cool.
Okay, so let's talk
about $1 million for 5%,
impugning a $20 million
valuation.
?Yes.
?Yeah.
Now, that's very aggressive,
even on "Shark Tank,"
and that's why I'm so excited
to hear about your sales.
Sure.
We have done over
$1 million in sales...
in the last 10 days.
?10 days?
?No.
And $2 million
in the last 30 days,
and over $20 million
in the last three years.
Wait, reel it back.
Say it again slower.
What?
We've done over $1 million
in the last 10 days,
and over $20 million in
the last three years.
No way.
Yes, way.
Either you guys are the world's
worst businesspeople
or you don't need us,
so why are you here?
This is our first time
building a business
like this,
scaling things.
Our challenge
is that we've ??
we've taken no outside
investment.
We've bootstrapped
everything ourselves.
We were bottlenecking
the company.
We really felt like we
could have grown a lot faster
if there was more
than just the two of us.
So what are your margins?
So our gross margin's 90%.
?90%.
?Yes. Yes.
?90%?
Our average net income
is about 10%.
So, uh ??
Because we're spending
a lot of money in ??
in marketing, right?
We have the capacity to grow
a lot faster than we are.
We have ??
Wait, I don't understand,
though.
I don't see where
all of a sudden
you would start
to have a problem,
unless you ?? you don't
have money, you need money.
?So what do you sell it for?
?So what's the problem?
So, to answer your question,
we sell it for $34.99.
The problem is that we need
an influx of capital.
We're putting everything
that comes
out of net
back into the company,
but we have over 3,000 U. S.
retail stores
on a wait list
to purchase it.
What's the cost
to make it?
Yeah, about $3.50.
Cuban: So right now
you're only online
and you want to
go to retail?
Yeah.
We're completely
direct?to?consumer.
15% of our sales
is via Amazon,
and we're only really on Amazon
due to knock?offs.
Do you have a patent?
We have multiple patents.
Utility?
Yeah, we have two patents
that have been ??
Yes.
Rodriguez: Wait, wait.
I just want to take
a step back here.
Just really basic terms here.
The last 12 months, how much
have you made top line,
what is net,
net in your pocket?
We've grossed $9 million.
We've netted $400,000.
Where's all the money going?
IP enforcement.
We did have a very strategic
but expensive IP defense.
How expensive?
We sent about half a million
that came out of ??
Okay.
Yeah.
That was to stop
all the knock?offs.
?Yeah.
?Correct.
?So you have spent,
obviously,
a lot of money on marketing.
How much money and what was
the form of marketing?
Facebook
is our primary channel.
It's where we spend more than
90% of our revenue dollars.
?And how much did you spend?
?How much did you spend?
About $3 million
on Facebook.
And then ??
Probably closer to $4 million.
?Really?
?Closer ??
Closer to $4 million.
?Yeah.
?$4 million on Facebook ads?
Aren't you better going off
to influencers?
Facebook has always
performed for us.
We can criticize
your customer acquisition
and your marketing spend ??
I get it.
What I'm struggling with is,
what's this $20 million B. S.?
We've had a discussion
with a?an investment bank
that specializes
in the drinkware space,
and this type of product,
when you get to the point
where it's brand,
which we're actively
building successfully ??
And it's ??
What did they value it at?
Four times gross
is what they sold ??
?Four times gross revenue?
?Four times gross?
?Correct.
But they're not willing
to write a check.
Look, you've done a great job,
but it's just about valuation
at this point.
We're so far apart.
Our ?? Our whole
point of doing this
is to build and continue
to build a durable brand.
Let me pitch you guys.
I got a deal for you.
Ready?
Buckle your chin strap.
I have $9 million in sales.
At the end of all that,
I have $400,000 in my pocket.
I have $3 million
in marketing costs,
and I have $500,000
in legal fees.
Why would you
want to invest with me?
Well, the legal fees
were built last year on ??
I'm out.
I mean, it just makes no sense.
Look, this is what I call
a schmutz deal, right?
Even if you guys hit
on all cylinders,
where's the upside for us?
So, you sell for $20 million,
we break even.
You know, you sell
for $40 million, we double,
but it's still not a huge number
all things considered
relative to the risk.
You just didn't price it
in a way that accommodates
the risk/reward,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay.
Good luck, though.
Thank you.
All right, you want
my million bucks
to help you launch into retail.
It's not just money.
It's also the strategic
partnership.
I?I'm struggling with how
to structure this thing,
'cause I?I love revenue.
I really do.
I love cash flow.
These things ??
And royalties.
And I love royalties, too.
How about this deal?
I give you $250,000 for 10% and
$750,000 as a line of credit,
which is basically
factoring at 11%.
Then you have a Shark.
That's true.
And I don't feel like a schmuck
paying for ridiculous valuation.
Frankly, you need capital.
Kevin, I'm ?? Let me give them,
uh, an offer here.
So you said $250,000
for 10%.
I'm gonna give you
$500,000 for 20%.
We'll do it together.
We'll give you another $500,000
at the 11%,
three years, that's convertible,
at the same valuation.
Yeah, I'm interested
in that deal.
Get two Sharks,
there's your million bucks.
You don't look excited.
Going from being willing
to sell 5%,
which is certainly
negotiable to an extent,
to 20% is ??
is beyond what we're ??
where we're
willing to go.
Were you willing to go 10%?
Alex and Kevin have offered
Matt and Adam $500,000
plus a $500,000 line
of credit for a 20% stake
in their insulated
bottle holder,
BottleKeeper, but Lori
also seems interested.
Do you have an offer?
Callinan: Offers start coming,
and then complicated offers.
It was a lot more of an intense
negotiation than I expected.
Sure. It's the Shark Tank,
right?
Congrats.
Your first royalty deal.
No, not my first.
You've learned from the master.
If the investment goes bad,
you can always drink it away.
?Cheers.
?Cheers.
