Hi, Sharks, I'm Ryan.
And I'm Arik.
And we're...
Rynarik!
Rynarik!
We're from
Minneapolis?Saint Paul,
Minnesota, and today,
we're seeking $75,000
in exchange for 15%
of our business.
Sharks,
we live in a busy world.
As a freelance photographer,
I am always on the go.
One day, my little boy
looked at me,
he said, "Dad, how come
you're never home for dinner?"
And it just broke
my heart.
It was at that moment
I vowed never to miss a meal
with him again.
And that's why we invented
the Snack Hat ??
the perfect solution
for balancing work and family.
[ Laughter ]
Snack Hat is
a patent?pending neoprene cap
that easily slides
onto most heads.
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, my God!
?It comes complete ??
It comes complete
with a stylish,
multi?compartment plate
that's both dishwasher safe
and...wait for it.
Magnetic!              Magnetic!
Oh, gosh!
With Snack Hat,
you can work more
while still spending time
with your kids.
Snack Hat.            Snack Hat.
[ Laughs ]
Sharks, we know
how you don't
like companies
that just have one product.
So, rest assured,
we're a business
that has a whole line
of innovative solutions.
Like Bathe &amp; Brew.
Shorten
your morning routine
by brewing coffee
in your shower.
?Oh, my God.
?And our best?selling Pet Sweep.
[ Laughter ]
Double up,
play with your pup
while doing chores!
You see...
we solve problems
for everyone.
Even Sharks.
Here are a few more
of our products.
[ Laughs ]
I love the Pet Sweep.
Our gifts to you.
Ah, presents!
Mr. John.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't think we've ever had
a present we got to unwrap.
?Thank you.
?Go on, unwrap 'em.
Thank you, sir.
You bet.
Go on, unwrap 'em.
Okay.
Cuban:
I got cool stuff.
[ Laughter ]
Oh...my...God.
Corcoran: Oh, God!
John: I got a baby feeder
for the ??
Virtual reality headset
for a cat.
[ Laughs ]
I got the Roto Wipe.
Corcoran: Oh, God.
Barb, what's yours?
I'm always looking
to save time.
I've got a Handy Hand.
That ?? That one eliminates
your need for toilet paper.
?To clean the toilet out.
?Saves a lot of dough.
?Saves a lot of dough.
?Oh, my God.
Sharks, our actual company
is Prank?O.
We sell prank gift boxes.
We put a new twist
on gift?giving
and add life to any party.
John: All right.
Greiner: Is there actually
something in here?
[ Laughing ] No!
That's the whole point!
?Oh.
?That's the whole point.
They sell the boxes,
that's brilliant.
Well, how disappointing.
Simply buy any
of our prank boxes,
you hide
your real gift inside,
and you sit back and watch
as the fun unfolds.
So, who wants to help us
prank the world...
Brilliant.
...and invest $640,000
for 8% of Prank?O.
?Oh, that ruins it!
?You've got to be kidding me!
?Ohh, you ??
?Wait, you changed it?
Wait, didn't you say
$75,000 for 15%?
?That was a prank.
?That was back in the...
?It's the prank.
?It was a prank.
This is
an entertainment vessel.
?Ohh!
?You put their real gift inside.
Oh, I got it!
This guy's a moron.
Cuban: And they ??
Like your reactions... Ohh!
Since 2013, we've sold
$10 million of empty boxes.
Well, now you have
our respect.
John:
That's kind of weird.
How much will you do this year
in business?
This year,
it's, uh, $2.8 million.
O'Leary: Let's walk through
the business model.
Sure.
How do I find out
about Prank?O?
How do you sell me
the product?
Do you have retail distribution,
or is it direct?
We do ??
Uh, we have mass retail.
We're in mass retail
as well as, uh, on e?commerce.
What do you sell them
at retail for?
What does it cost you
to make 'em?
What are your margins?
So, we make them
for 66 cents.
?Yeah.
?Online,
they sell for $8.
$8.
?One box?
?For a box?
?One box.
?One box.
Greiner: What did you guys do
before this?
What takes you
[Laughs] to this place?
Yeah.
So, I was, uh, one
of the, uh, early partners
of The Onion,
and, um...
?The Onion?
?The Onion.
Yes. Yes, ma'am.
Oh, really?
Good for you.
We were just a little newspaper
in Wisconsin.
The Onion?
What ?? What is it?
It's a satir??
a satirical newspaper.
I did that for 20 years,
and, um,
we had this box
in our e?comm store
that was flying
off the shelves,
and it was
some designer guy,
outside designer guy
that had it. So...
?It was you.
?Yes.
I met Arik.
A couple years later,
and a few happy hours later,
we, uh, started Prank?O.
What's your background?
I'm, uh ?? 20 years,
I've been, uh ??
uh, self?employed,
a graphic designer,
and this hit me
way back when,
watching my nephew
open a toaster oven ??
it appeared to be
a toaster oven.
His parents put
the real video game inside,
and it was just
this great moment at ??
at ?? at Christmas...
It's brilliant.
...that everybody loved.
It's brilliant.
And within a week,
I started ??
started
my first prototype.
And you do it three weeks
out of the year.
So, what do you do
the rest of the year?
Well ??
That's what we want
to talk about.
Yes.
We want to ??
There's ?? There's 541...
Billion gifting occasions.
...million
gifting occasions ??
birthdays, anniversaries,
uh, graduation,
Father's Day, Mother's Day.
And what we want to do
is market to those people.
So, a couple questions.
So, last Christmas,
your last shipping season,
what did you do in total revenue
and what was your net profit?
Okay, so, that's where I need
to, uh, clarify some things.
We started this
in 2013.
2016 and '17, we, uh ??
uh, we got distracted.
We had other
seasonal opportunities,
novelty gifts,
had to deal with Asia,
and, uh, molds,
and, uh...
Set?up fees.
...set?up fees ??
You were making products
like that magnet head dish?
Yes.
Cuban: You tried to create
physical products...
Yes.
...and expand your business
on e?commerce
because we have traffic,
we're funny...
Yes.
Yep. Right.
Bottom line is
we made mistakes,
we lost focus,
lesson learned.
Okay, put that ??
?Okay.
?Well, but what's your debt?
$1 million long term.
How much cash do you have
in the bank?
Uh, right now, it's, uh ??
tightest time of the year.
We're working off
the line of credit.
How much have you pulled
on your line of credit
as of right now?
Uh, $3 million.
Oh!
Oh.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Let me just share with you
my thought.
I think very funny, clever idea
and all of that.
But I like things
that sustain
and are sold more
throughout the year.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Uh, structurally,
the business is not investable,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
The way I see your business is
you have $1 million in debt,
you have zero money
in the bank, you have no profit,
you have skinny margins, and
you're valuing your business ??
I can't do the math, but
it looks like around $7 million.
I don't get it.
I'd love to see numbers
I can get my teeth into.
I?I'm sorry,
but I'm out.
Ryan and Arik came in
seeking $640,000
for 8% of their
prank gift box company, Prank?O.
Mark is interested, but he wants
more than three times
the equity
they initially offered.
?I'll offer you the 640k.
?Okay.
But I need 25%
of your business.
Okay, interesting offer,
let me give it to you
a different way.
I'm in this space
in a big way.
Yes, sir.
Lovepop cards.
Yes.
Potato Parcel.
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
I live this in and out
about rotating SKUs,
the seasonality of gifting.
There's two things
I can do for you.
I can smooth out the seasonality
a little bit.
But the real added value
is to get your website
so it becomes 10%, 11%, 12%,
13%, 14% of your business
direct at 8 bucks a pop.
That I do because
I have millions of names
that already go
through my gift cycle
at three different companies,
all right?
Okay.
I'm gonna give you
the $640,000.
I want 38 cents royalty
on every unit.
That's it, no equity.
Get $640,000
and you get my team,
and we'll fix this business
for you.
Guys, the only sales pitch
I'll add for myself
is we test it with the Mavs,
you know...
I can spend a buck a pop,
right,
to go out there
and do custom,
and we come up
with something fun.
The Dirk Nowitzki Shot Guide,
or what ?? whatever it is.
It's up for you to ??
you guys to decide.
Don't let Mark do
the writing.
That wasn't very funny.
[ Laughs ]
But that's not enough.
I?I need you
to sell 1.7 million packages
just to get my money back.
Listen ?? listen ??
listen to me.
Liste?? Kevin. Kevin.
I got a ba?? I'm gonna bump
this business up
big time.
Yeah, but Mark is the buyer,
as well.
Yeah, I'm the buyer,
right?
Yeah, I got that.
But that's 15,000, 20,000 units.
So what?
And so if it works
for me ??
it works for me, it's gonna work
for every sport,
every university.
We can go get license,
we can get NBA licenses.
Would you go 15%?
No.
No?
20% with a line of credit?
No. It's got to be 25%
because it's gonna take
a lot of work,
and it's gonna take
a lot of guidance.
I, uh...
There's no equity,
Mr. Wonderful?
?It doesn't make sense.
?No?
It doesn't make sense.
You know...
And then you want ??
You would ?? you would ??
you would ask
for 38 cents?
Per unit, I'll have to sell
a million ??
?Is that indefinitely?
?I have to sell 1.7 million
of these
to get my money back.
Right, but indefinitely?
Indefinitely?
?Is that indefinitely?
Yes! It's a partnership
of three guys,
that's what this is.
What I try and do
is expand
the direct?to?customer sales
without a middle man
in the middle
as we do at Lovepop.
Right.
We covet that direct sale
because we capture the name!
Mm?hmm.
And we sell those people
25% again on every season.
That's the key
to your business.
No, it's not.
And it ?? it absolutely is
the key to your business.
I'll tell you the key
to your business,
besides simplifying, is going
to e?commerce retailers
and having them o?offer this
as an option, an up?sale option.
Put it in a ?? you know,
"You bought this,"
put it in the front ??
You do that, too,
but you're not capturing
any value in your own name.
On a seasonal business,
where there's
a birthday involved,
or there's a gifting period
like Easter or Christmas,
you need the name,
because 25% of those people
buy again at full margin.
You mean
the mailing list.
Yes!
That's how you do it.
I have to say,
you can't afford his 38 cents.
Sure you can.
Could you ?? Could you ??
Would you ??
Would you consider 20%?
?No.
?No?
