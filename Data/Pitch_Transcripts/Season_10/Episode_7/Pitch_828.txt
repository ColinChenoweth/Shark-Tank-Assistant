Hi, Sharks. I'm Nick Palermo
from Aspen, Colorado,
and I love skiing!
But these skis...
[ Grunts ]
...they get heavy
after a while.

[ Chuckles ]
Hi, Sharks.
Nick and I are asking
for $50,000
in exchange
for 15% of our business.
I also love skiing,
but Nick is right,
these things do get heavy
after a while.
That's why
I invented Ski?Z.
It's a caddy for your skis
that fits in your pocket.
Simply attach the Ski?Z
to the front of the skis
using the handy
Velcro strap.
The wheel allows you
to roll your skis
straight to the slopes.
Palermo: You can push it,
you can pull it.
You can turn your skis
on a dime.
I've been in the ski industry
for 35 years,
and I have never seen anything
that makes
getting to and from the slopes
as easy as Ski?Z.
[ Laughs ]
So, who wants to rock 'n' roll
with Ski?Z?
Boom!
?That's a pretty cool thing.
?Yeah.
Does it roll
when it's in snow?
Absolutely.
No difference whatsoever?
No difference.
Do you guys have
a patent on it?
?We do have a utility patent.
?Oh, yeah.
?It's solid.
?Is it issued?
It is issued.
Utility?
Corcoran: What does it cost
to make
and what do you sell it for?
Kyle: The cost is $3.50.
?And what do you sell it for?
?And what do you sell it for?
$19.95.
Good for you.
Nice. Nice price.
O'Leary: And where are you
selling them
and what are
your sales like?
Our first year in sales
was ??
Was this year?
No, our first year was
in 2013.
Wow.
In a matter
of about four months,
we did $230,000.
?Okay.
?Okay. And in 2014?
Uh, went to zero.
To zero?
?Went to zero.
?Why?
?Do tell.
?Sounds like a story.
We both had
very major personal problems.
I got cancer.
?Oh, I'm sorry.
?Oh, I'm sorry.
I found out everybody ??
every male,
at some point in their life,
has prostate cancer.
Yeah, and if you're old enough,
you don't care.
Well, I still care.
My girlfriend is 32.
[ Laughs ]
What year was this?
2014.
And you're cancer?free now?
Yep. Big time.
?Congratulations.
?That's good, congrats.
Kyle: Well,
let me just say this.
I think this is the best way
to explain our lives.
Do any of you know how to take
a 747 out of a nose dive?
You don't.
And that's what happened
to both of our lives.
In 2013,
I get home one day,
and totally blind sided,
I went through a divorce.
So, 2013's not a good year.
[ Laughs ]
And we're going into 2014
right now ??
Okay,
so we got a goose egg.
What happens 2015?
Um, 2015 comes along,
I was working
with a manufacturing company
in the oil
and gas industry.
Oil fell down
to $35 a barrel.
I didn't have a paycheck
anymore.
Are we zero in 2015, too?
We were zero up to ??
?What happened 2016?
?Let's keep going on yours.
And so 2016, we exceeded
our 100?year floodplain.
South of Louisiana
went underwater.
We lost everything.
In the floodplain?
Yes, ma'am.
Mm?hmm.
And ??
So that's 2016.
You know, I kept getting
knocked down, but I get back up.
Okay, so that's a zero.
What about '17?
That's a zero, too.
Okay, let's get to 2018.
We're in 2018.
2018.
Where are we at, man?
Oh, we skipped '19.
We skipped 2019?
Oh, yeah, right,
I forgot.
?Yeah, you skipped 2019, Barb.
?Barbara, please d??
?We haven't hit that yet.
?This just shows you ??
Settle.
Barbara came back from
the future to be with us today.
[ Laughter ]
Okay, 2018,
we're here now,
everything's been a zero...
[ Laughter ]
...since 2013
when you did $230,000.
?Right.
?What is going on in 2018?
2018, we're projected to do
$575,000 in sales.
?Wow.
?So, you ?? you're coming ??
the product's coming back
in the market.
Things are good.
You've worked things out,
we're projecting $575,000
in sales.
How are you gonna
distribute it?
What's gonna happen here?
As of right now,
we are talking
to a distribution company
out of Denver.
Right. Right.
Are they a national distributor
for ski products?
How many have you actually sold
this year?
Yes, sir. Well, right now,
we haven't sold any this year.
Do you have anything
in inventory?
We have $350,000 worth
in inventory.
I bought those roughly
about five years ago.
Where did you get the
money to buy $350,000
worth of inventory?
Did you mortgage
your house?
I did.
I mortgaged my home.
Yeah, I mortgaged ??
?I have a question.
I mortgaged...
Ay?yi?yi.
So, um, do you have
any ownership stake in this?
Yes, he has 25%.
25%.
25%.
Is there anybody else?
My wife has 25%,
and I have ??
I?I'm remarried now.
And your wife is still
at 25%?
I'm remarried.
He's remarried.
I'm remarried.
Okay.
Your new wife.
New wife.
?So, the new wife has 25%.
?New wife has 25%.
?Yes.
?Oh, Kyle, you've been busy.
[ Laughter ]
Okay, I have an offer.
Okay?
I'm gonna give you [Laughs]
$50,000 for 15%.
But you have
to accept it now.
?Take it.
?Take it.
Cuban:
Don't look a gift horse.
That's what you wanted,
you have to say yes.
Take it. Right. Take it.
All right.
[ Indistinct whispering ]
It's exactly
what you asked for.
I'll simplify ?? I'm out.
And I'm gonna be
really insulted
if I give you
what you ask for ??
I'll complicate it ??
$50,000 for 20%.
[ Laughter ]
Gee, that's hard.
Guys, guys, don't look
a gift horse in the mouth.
?Yeah.
?You have an opportunity.
Don't blow it.
?Take the deal.
?That you would even discuss it,
I'm feeling offended,
I'm feeling hurt.
Oh, stop being a crybaby.
What are you guys
gonna do?
Um...
What is your hesitation?
John: It depends on what Shark
you want.
I ?? you know, I believe
in you two lover boys.
Let's go.
Doesn't sound like
they want either one of us.
Barbara, would you be willing
if, uh ??
No.
O'Leary: Wait a sec.
What ?? What's your question?
[ Laughter ]
You're taking too long,
you're pissing her off.
Greiner: [ Laughing ] She didn't
even hear what you had to say.
I'm gonna be here
when she's out,
don't worry about it.
What is
your guys' concern?
Um, my concern is if
we would need a line of credit
of, uh ?? of $50,000
if we would need it. Would you
be able to help us with that?
You mean in addition
to the $50,000?
Yes ?? Yes, ma'am,
if we would need it.
You already have
the merchandise.
As long as I have
the purchase orders,
why wouldn't I fund it?
Okay.
Of course.
But you should've made that
part of your deal,
because in essence,
you're asking for $50,000
and another $50,000.
And you're not
a very good boy.
[ Laughs ]
Cuban: So, what are you guys
gonna do?
You're right about that.
Guys, you have ??
you have two offers.
What do you want to do?
Corcoran: Another conversation!
I've never seen
anything like this.
