Stephens: It can remind us
of the comforts of being a child
and make us feel good.
Oh, my God,
I'm in love.
O'Leary: I'm deserving of one,
and I've been really good
this year.
I actually think
he's a pretty nice boy.
You might want to re?check
that list, Mrs. Claus.

Hi, Sharks, I'm Sam Stephens,
and I'm the founder of OatMeals.
I'm seeking
a $500,000 investment
for 20% of my business.
All of us have some
sort of connection to oatmeal.
We were fed it growing up,
and it can remind us of
the comforts of being a child,
of being home,
and make us feel good.
It's also pretty awesome
that it's one
of the most healthy foods
on the planet.
OatMeals is
a build?your?own oatmeal café
where we put modern twists
on an old?fashioned favorite.
We serve steel?cut, hot oatmeal
with nearly 80 toppings,
but what really makes
my café shine
are my nearly 30
signature bowls
ranging from healthy to sweet
to even savory oatmeal
with nontraditional toppings
like Parmesan cheese,
truffle oil,
poached eggs,
and even bacon.
Wow.
I'm ready to expand OatMeals
all across America.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to top off my oatmeal
with some cash?
?Feed me.
?We want the oatmeal first.
Cuban: Feed me.
Yeah, do you have
truffle oatmeal?
Yes!
Feed me.
I have some samples
for you guys.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, so I'm serving you guys
the truffle risotto,
and I added bacon
to this one.
Truffle?
Oh, bacon.
Yes.
That's like talking dirty
to me.
So, the truffle risotto is
shaved Parmesan cheese,
truffle oil, bacon,
sea salt, and pepper.
What are the other ones?
So, then the hot date
is bananas...
Wow!
...pecans, dates,
uh, honey,
our house granola,
and some peanut butter.
And then lastly,
the antioxidant awakening.
?Oh, my God.
?Awaken me.
Awaken me.
The truffle is amazing!
?Yay!
?Oh, my God.
Is the pomegranate one
a dessert?
Stephens: Well, it's actually
pretty healthy
because it has
the Greek yogurt...
That's pretty good.
...chia seeds,
dark chocolate chips.
?Oh, my God, I'm in love.
?Awesome.
?Oh, this is incredible.
?It's so good.
Corcoran: I love the bacon
with the cheese.
Yum!
Ohh!
John:
And I hate oatmeal!
It's like a dinner,
not a breakfast.
So, um, in the shop...
This is delicious!
...people really didn't know
about savory oats,
but you can get all the benefits
of eating oatmeal
for lunch or dinner,
not just for breakfast.
This is great!
?What is it?
?Just grab it, yeah.
What are the caloric
and carbo metrics to this?
So, in the shop,
the bowls come
in a baby, mama,
or papa bear size ??
8, 12, or 16 ounces.
The baby bear, plain,
starts at just 110 calories,
the mama bear, 150 calories,
and then the papa bear,
about 180.
Why don't you give us
some prices on those, as well?
Yes, um, the baby bear starts
at $4.25,
mama bear, $5.25,
papa pear, $6.25,
and that includes two toppings
of your choice.
Each additional topping
is either 50 cents
or 25 cents.
We get a lot of different things
that come into the Shark Tank,
a lot of different foods.
These are some of
the most delicious things
ever brought in here.
Thank you so much.
And the interesting thing
is they're all very different.
Exactly.
What is the game plan here?
This is a store
that sells oatmeal?
It is, um...
Single location?
I can show you a picture
of the store.
That's the exterior.
I'm in Greenwich Village
on West 3rd Street
in Downtown New York City.
You want me to invest
in this single store?
Yeah, so I'd like
to expand firstly
in New York City,
either in Midtown Manhattan ??
So you want to open
more locations?
?Yes.
?How did you come up with this?
Stephens: So, I had this idea,
but I really didn't know
how to make it happen.
I was working in
the investment banking world
as an executive assistant
for many years,
then I finally went
to culinary school
while I was working full?time
because I knew
I really needed the credentials
as being a chef
to make this happen.
So, after I became a chef,
I finally, you know,
left my career,
and made this happen.
I've been open for six years,
the business has been growing
every year.
Can you tell us if it's been
profitable and for how long?
So, over six years, um,
I've made $2.5 million.
What about this year?
This year, I'm on track
to do $500,000.
How many square feet
is the store?
It's 380 square feet.
Sam, what were your profits
last year?
So, uh, $470,000 last year
gross,
the net was $45,000.
?After you paid yourself?
?Yes.
And what did you
pay yourself?
Not much. [ Laughs ]
Probably about 40 grand.
Corcoran: And how do you
support yourself
if you're only taking out
$40,000?
I know New York is
so expensive.
Do you even have the money
to eat your own oatmeal?
[ Chuckles ] That's basically
all I can really afford to eat.
[ Laughs ]
Um, I'm also a spokesperson
for Quaker Oats.
I was approached
by Pepsi Quaker...
You are?
...right after I opened
the store.
Um, I've had some really
great press just organically.
And they pay you
for that?
They do. My contract with them
is $60,000 this year,
it's not much.
Cuban: No, that's awesome.
You're making more
with Qu?? with them
than you are your store.
That's awesome.
Have you ever thought of
taking your different oatmeals
and packaging them so that they
could be in freezer sections?
Absolutely. Um, because
I always thought it would be fun
to do a packaged food line.
You know, getting oatmeal
out of the breakfast aisle
and into the rice
and pasta aisle.
I think you face
a pretty high mountain to climb
because the perception
of the consumer in America
with oatmeal is going
to be forever with breakfast.
Very creative, product's great,
everybody agrees.
But I don't think
about eating oatmeal
after 10:00 in the morning,
like 99.999% of the ??
No, that's not true.
That's not true at all.
Let me finish, Mark.
Let me finish.
But I'm more concerned
about the numbers.
350 square feet, you need
to be doing about $1 million,
$1.2 million a year to make this
an interesting opportunity
to expand to more locations
or to franchise,
because you're basically making
no money.
You can't even live in New York
for $45,000.
There's rats that are making
more money than that.
?[ Laughs ]
?Right.
You are not worth $2.5 million
as an opportunity.
I'm out.
John: I think
you're figuring out ??
I mean, it's clear
you're the oatmeal whisperer,
but, you know,
at $500,000,
I think even if you had
some good years
on the second or third store,
it would take me 12 years
to get my money back.
So I'm out.
Stephens: Thank you.
Greiner: Well, here's one of
the problems ??
locations, right?
Mm?hmm.
My Bantam Bagels, they came in
with one bagel ball
that was stuffed
with great cream cheeses
in different flavors,
and we got
into Starbucks nationwide.
That was pivotal.
And then got into
all the grocery stores.
And now we've done
$40 million.
I'm trying to think
how could we try
to replicate that model?
And the big question
really goes to you.
So, are you open to packaging,
selling in retail?
Like, doing a completely
different model.
Absolutely.
All right, then I'm gonna
give you an offer.
I'm gonna make it contingent,
though,
on if you will figure out
packaging.
Pick top flavors.
We'll try to bring it
to Starbucks.
I'll give you the $500,000,
but I want 33.3%.
I want to be a third partner.
'Cause it's gonna be
quite a bit of work.
?Okay.
?I have another offer for you,
but I have a whole different
spin on your business.
I believe you could have
a very successful business
if you brought
your business onto a cart
and serve oatmeal
to corporate America
in the morning
and risotto for lunch.
I don't think
it's that much of a change.
And I'd be happy to give you
the $500,000,
but I want 50%
of not your store ??
no interest in something
that doesn't make money.
But I'll give you
the $500,000
if I could own 50%
of the cart business
and let the money be
entirely used
for making that business
a reality.
That doesn't have a contingency
like Lori, right?
Well, I guess you could say
the contingency
is the money's only to be used
for the cart business.
We must be on the planet Zutron
right now.
Go away, be quiet.
You are the store
that makes no money,
have two half?a?million?dollar
offers.
That never happens
on the planet Earth.
So you better think about this
right now
and make a decision.
Sammy,
what do you want to do?
Narrator: Two Sharks are out.
Sam has two offers on the table
from Barbara and Lori
for her oatmeal restaurant,
OatMeals,
but they have
very different plans
for what to do
with the business.
We'll try to bring it
to Starbucks
and to the frozen food
sections ??
Corcoran: But may I tell you
why you should really
do the deal with me?
Because I picked up
Cousins Maine Lobster,
they never thought they could
move off of one truck.
They now have 40 trucks,
they have $50 million in sales
in four years.
Let me tell you,
the key to that deal
was looking at it
differently.
The one liability
every entrepreneur has
when they have
a slow start financially
is they're too close
to the problem to see it.
Your problem is not
your ingredients,
your dedication,
the product you're making ??
You're getting
rave reviews!
Your product is
you're literally
physically stuck
in that store.
So, you're really crazy
not to give this a shot,
and I wouldn't certainly
put my money into it
if I didn't totally believe
in it.
I could see clearly
from a mile away
how to expand the business,
see how to untie that knot
and get it pushing forward.
Lori,
would you consider 30%?
Ugh!
30%?
It's the wrong
business model.
Let's meet at 33.3%.
I mean, we ??
I want to be a third partner
because we're bringing
a lot.
Cuban: Remember,
it's a contingency, Sam.
So, if you don't get
that distribution,
you don't have a deal.
Well, you're gonna get it.
I think Barbara's deal
is safer for you.
I mean, I go with my gut.
I mean, I think
this is something.
I wouldn't give the offer
if I didn't think
it was something
that was going to happen.
But you can't guarantee
Starbucks, Lori.
You can't do that.
Barbara can guarantee.
?They sell oatmeal already.
?With the way she wants to go.
You got to knock
the other guy out.
Sam, one offer is a bet
on distribution
for a product
you don't have.
The other offer is taking
what you already do
and replicating
in a more profitable,
more efficient format.
Sammy,
what do you want to do?
?Congratulations, Sam.
?Good luck.
Corcoran: The worst news of all
is she wasn't smart.
Stephens: Ultimately,
I went with Lori
because I have seen the success
that she's done
with Bantam Bagels,
and I followed that,
and I don't think I'll have
any regrets tomorrow.
Um, you know, I?I came in
initially wanting a deal
with Barbara,
but, um, Lori's offer
just sounded really great.
You just stole
millions of dollars
from this babe and sent her down
the wrong path.
What?! That's crazy.
You never even make oatmeal.
I make it,
it doesn't freeze,
it's not even good
the next morning.
There's no chan??
You really sold her
a bill of goods.
Barb, honey, you're just upset
because I won.
Of course I'm upset
that I lost.
[ Chuckles ]
What do you think?
Well, Barbara,
you were asking 50%.
50% of an entirely
new business.
I'm eating my oatmeal.
Lori, that ??
that was a dumb deal.
You made a dumb deal.
Oh, my God.
?Dumb. Dumb.
?Any time it's not your deal,
it's a dumb deal.
?No, she made the dumb deal.
No, Lori didn't make
a dumb deal.
Sam ??
I didn't make
a dumb deal.
She made a dumb deal,
you made a dumb deal.
You deserve each other.
Oh, my God, Barb.
You deserve each other.
I agree with that.
You're acting, you know,
a little jelly.
It's painful.
[ Chuckles ] Jelly.
[ Meows ]
