My name is Mitch Allen.
I am the founder, and head elf,
at Hire Santa.
I am offering 10%
of the workshop
in exchange
for 200,000 cookies.
[ Whispers indistinctly ]
Ohh! I mean dollars.
Sharks, I brought
a very special guest
all the way
from the North Pole ??
Santa Claus!
Ho, ho, ho!
Corcoran: Hey, Santa.
[ Laughs ]
Everyone loves Santa,
but let's face it ??
Santa's a very busy guy.
He can't be everywhere
at once.
That's why I started my company,
Hire Santa.
Mitch: To put you
in the Christmas spirit,
we brought...
A Black Santa!
We brought
your very own Christmas hats.
?Thank you.
?Thank you so much.
?Thank you.
?All right, thank you.
Corcoran:
Wow, look at this.
[ Chuckles ]
Hire Santa uses
some of Santa's friends
to help spread
the Christmas cheer
whenever you need him.
We find
the perfect Santa entertainer
and take care
of all the details.
With Hire Santa, anyone can get
a visit from Santa.
Even if you're
on the naughty list.
Barbara.
[ Gasps ]
Barbara!
So, Sharks, who wants to play
in this reindeer game
and "sleigh" it
with Hire Santa?
?Ho, ho, ho!
?[ Laughs ]
Mitch, are you telling me
that Santa's not real?
I'm saying that Santa
is real,
and we've got some of Santa's
friends here today...
Okay.
...that Hire Santa uses.
Now, Santas, this may take
a little bit,
so let's get comfortable.
?Ho, ho, ho!
Greiner: There's one Santa,
he's in the North Pole.
These are imposter friends.
That's all.
These are friends of Santa,
that's right.
Yes.
What up, Santa?
So, tell us,
how much does it cost
to hire a Santa friend?
It depends
on what it is.
The majority of our business
is actually retail.
So these are
long?term engagements
where we put in a Santa
for many hours,
say 300 or 400 hours
during the course of the season.
So, that's
a different pricing
from let's say I want
to come to your home
to give
a very special one ??
But what is that pricing?
And that is, say,
$200 or $300
for a personalized visit
from Santa.
But if you're having Santa work
for many days,
either at an office
or at a retail store,
what would that
be around?
So, it starts on the low end
of about $50 or $60.
These are long?term ??
An hour or a day?
Per hour.
These are negotiated rates
with long?term contracts,
so it's not just a one?off.
We have literally thousands
of Santas in our database,
so we're able
to provide Santas.
[ Laughs ]
You have thousands?
We've sent Santas ??
we've sent Santas all the way
to China,
the Caribbean, Canada,
Mexico...
Greiner: Wow.
...and, of course,
all over the U. S.
I hired a Santa,
and he came over,
and he smelled like
a Billy goat.
[ Laughter ]
He was horrible.
That's why you need
Hire Santa,
because all of our Santas
are professionally trained.
How do you make money
when your whole business
is around Christmas?
We have six weeks,
from November 10th?ish all
the way through Christmas Day,
is when we have Santas
that are out.
Mr. Elf, how did you come up
with the idea,
and how did you get
to be Santa's friend?
I want
to be Santa's friend.
[ Laughs ]
How did you get
to do that?
So, I've always
loved Christmas.
About 10 years ago,
I had a friend ask me to come be
Santa for their child,
and that was
when it really all changed.
The children just radiate love
and joy about Christmas.
It's really
a magical experience.
You can ask
any of these Santas,
they want to be Santa
because it touches their heart.
I started being Santa
professionally,
started getting lots of business
myself.
Grew so quickly. I've been
in national TV commercials.
I've been in some of the biggest
parades in the world,
and I couldn't handle
all the business.
So, being an entrepreneur,
what do you do?
You got too much business?
?You delegate.
?You hire. You hire.
?Well, you ??
?Branch out.
You find somebody else to do it.
You start making ??
you start making money
through other Santas.
So, locally,
in the Dallas/Fort Worth area,
I found other Santas
to do the gigs I couldn't do.
And so I created Hire Santa,
and now I get people
from all over the world
requesting Santas to come
to their home,
their office, or their ??
Yeah, but where do you ??
So, how's the year's ??
Where do you so??
Where ??
where do you source
all the Santa ??
I mean, obviously,
these guys are bikers
during the summer.
[ Laughter ]
There's a vibrant Santa
community online,
and so it's really
just networking,
it's online marketing itself
to get Santas
to come
to our site online.
What's your total revenues?
Two years ago,
we did $189,000.
?Yeah.
?Last year, we did $331,000.
?Yeah.
?This year, we're gonna do
$1.2 million
to $1.4 million.
O'Leary: Whoa, wait a minute,
that's four times ??
And next year ?? Hold on.
And the year after that ??
The year after that ??
That's a four times.
So 4x.
Yes, and the year after that,
we're projecting to do
over $2 million.
Whoa!
Okay, let's ??
Well, how are you gonna get
the 4x jump this year?
We've already got a contract
with, uh,
the largest outdoor retailer,
and that is going to make up
most of the big jump
that we're having
this year.
So, what are you gonna use
the money for?
The ??
The first thing is, uh,
I need to make a couple
of strategic hires.
I am wearing way too many hats
right now,
and so particularly
in marketing.
We have some online
training videos currently,
so I want to improve
our training videos
so that we can take
an average Santa
and make him
an exceptional Santa
faster than
we're currently doing.
Mitch, you didn't talk
about profitability.
So, let me just get
back to that.
So when we did $189,000,
we made $70,000.
When we did $331,000 last year,
uh, we netted $154,000.
And this year,
we're estimating between ??
between $450,000
and $550,000.
I think it's lovely
to bring that kind of joy
into kids' homes,
but your revenue stream
really comes in
about six weeks
at the back half of the year.
I just like to be in a business
that is more consistent
throughout the year,
and so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you. I really appreciate
your input today.
A lump of coal for you.
Cuban: What you've accomplished
is phenomenal, right?
I mean, it all comes down
to salesmanship.
But at the end of the day,
it's still a staffing business,
and it's about chasing
as many contracts as you can,
and that's
a brutally competitive business.
It's not a business
that I think
that you can build a moat
around, and so...
Although, that point ??
...for those reasons,
I'm out, Mitch.
All right, thank you, Mark.
Really appreciate it.
John: I think that you're doing
an amazing job
at bringing all this happiness
to families.
It's just a business
that I don't want to be in.
So I'm out.
out of all these guys.
Mitch: Absolutely.
But, look, this business
is not worth $2 million.
Um, here's my proposal.
I'll give you the 200k,
I want to be your partner 50/50.
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh.
Excuse me, please.
Like I said ?? Scrooge.
Silence.
Let me ??
Let me talk with the elf.
This is a good deal for you,
here's why ??
you get 200k,
you got a partner,
every dollar that comes out
is 50/50,
I go to work
for you, too.
I'm interested. I don't have
Santas in my portfolio,
and every year,
I need another watch, so...
There's a reason for that,
Kevin.
So, Kevin, I very much
appreciate the offer.
I've been an entrepreneur
basically my whole life.
Uh, 50%, um, I know
that you wouldn't accept
that valuation if I were looking
for another, uh, investor.
Well, what's your counter?
Now, I know that you own ??
What's your counter?
I would counter
with $200,000
for 15% of the business.
Well, we're not gonna agree
on valuation, then.
What about
a different structure?
How about, um...
Mr. Wonderful,
how about we do this?
How about you do $200,000,
you make 50% of the profit,
but once you get
your money back,
you drop down to 10%,
and that remains your equity?
So, under
our currently model,
then you'll be getting this back
in less than two years.
Let's do this.
I like your deal. I want to make
a small tweak to it.
I want 20%.
On the long term.
Um...
John: I'll take
that original deal.
If you do it right now.
So, your deal ??
But he's not Mr. Wonderful.
I'll take that original deal
you just offered him.
So, you get 50% of the profits
until you get your money back,
and then you'll be at 10%.
Yep.
I'll do it at 15%.
And so ??
?Yeah.
?I want it at 15%, as well.
Uh ??
O'Leary: I'll go to 15%.
You get Mr. Wonderful
or you get the discount guy.
You snooze, you lose.
Um, if you'll do 10%,
we'll get ?? we'll do a deal.
Nah, I want to make
a little bit more.
I'll do it at 15%.
I'll do the 10%.
Oh, you're back in?
Yeah.
Mitch: Barbara has that twinkle
in her eye,
and she's gonna add
a tremendous amount of value,
so I had her picked out
right from the beginning.
Barbara usually has
a delayed fuse.
She was on this one
quick.
You know
what I like about it?
I'm getting my watch.
Cuban: [ Chuckles ]
?Jingle...
?Bells!
?Jingle...
?Bells!
Ho, ho, ho!
All: Ho, ho, ho!
Well done, gentlemen!
