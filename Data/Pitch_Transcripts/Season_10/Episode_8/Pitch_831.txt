We need a shark to help us
take a billion?dollar bite.
Narrator: ...by working smart...
Are you ready to try the best
tasting drink you've ever had?
Narrator: ...by thinking big...
You simply squeeze the zit,
and that's it.
Narrator:
...and chasing their dreams.
We're stepping up the
dance?fitness industry
to a whole new level.
Narrator:
And tonight, Skinnygirl mogul
Bethenny Frankel
and branding guru Rohan Oza
join the tank.
I think your valuation
is too steep.
But wait.
There's more.
Take it or leave it.
Don't go fishing.
No one else is gonna make
you an offer. I'm the only
one with creativity.
I'd like to say something!
No, no, no, no, no.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Bill Pierce.
And I'm Summer,
Bill's wife.
And I'm Kayla,
Bill's cousin.
And together...
All: We're Team Pop It Pal!
We're seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Sharks, millions of people
worldwide love popping zits.
Ew! No!
And pimple popping
has gone viral
with thousands of videos
being viewed every day.
But popping pimples is a bad
habit and has nasty side effects
such as germs, scars,
and, let's face it, more zits.
But now you can squeeze
as much as you please.
?Squeeze as ??
?That's right, Sharks.
We've invented Pop It Pal,
the world's first?ever
pimple?popping simulator.
Oh...
"Simulator"?
?My God.
?[ Laughs ] Seriously?!
Summer: Pop It Pal comes
with 16 ready?made pimples,
which allows you
to relieve stress
and get that extreme
satisfaction
that comes when
popping a pimple.
Ugh!
You simply squeeze the zit,
and that's it.
?Ew!
?Ew!
?Oh!
?But wait, there's more.
Crazy!
Summer: Pop It Pal
is refillable.
There's no longer a need to pick
your face or your partner's.
Bill: And, Sharks,
this is just the beginning.
We're ready to build an empire
of unique obsessions.
So, Sharks...
All: Who's ready
to get things poppin'?
Can we see some, please?
Can we play?
Oh, wow! Do we get samples?
Summer: And my background
is in nursing,
so I love gross things.
Are you full?time in this?
Hold on. Your background.
Sorry. Go ahead.
Yes.
And I shattered my heel
four years ago.
Uh, we actually ??
And so I couldn't
work as a nurse anymore.
So I needed to find something
that I could do from home
and still be able
to contribute to our family.
Roof:
I am Bill's cousin.
Roof: My background is in
marketing and advertising,
so that's when
we got to work
creating the website,
launching it,
putting together
a social media plan.
How do you protect
this technology?
Right. Just to break it
down ??
?Do you have a patent?
?Yes, we ?? right now,
we have a, uh,
utility patent pending...
?Because this is very serious.
?...in the U. S.
?If we're to invest in it...
?Of course!
...we want know that
these zits are safe.
Bill: So, we have a utility
patent pending in the U. S.
So, the function of the pop
from the silicone.
Why wouldn't you make it
look like a butt or a face?
Why does it look
like a sponge?
That's ?? that's ??
Look, that's their
future product.
Frankel: What?
?That's next.
?Exactly.
We do have
an entire line
of unique obsessions
ready to come next.
So are you guys ?? Okay.
So you sell $350,000
worth in 4 months.
That doesn't just happen
accidentally.
What happened?
Well, we started
doing a few videos.
We got over
30 million views...
?30 million?
?...in the first three weeks.
In the first three weeks
across how many videos?
?Wow!
?Yes.
?I think there was four major...
?Four major, but ??
...and then some
played off of that.
O'Leary:
Has it dropped off since?
Has it really
diminished dramatically?
And then people made
their own videos.
Um, we have normalized.
What's normalized mean?
Yes, $50,000 this month.
So, is $50,000 a month...
That's just great.
...what you think would be
a sustainable run rate?
We feel that
it would be a lot more
because our biggest issue
right now is meeting the demand.
We are able to fulfill
the orders in the United States.
No, I get that. But you're
paying too much to make them.
So, if you could
optimize volume...
Yes.
...what would
the new model look like?
Okay.
What could you build them for
in large scale?
So right now, we've been working
with an overseas supplier
to get our costs down
to about $5.
And we're looking ??
?Why is it so expensive?
?The silicone.
It sounds to me like,
a lot of peop??
This would be
a curiosity factor for me,
so I understand why you got
so many views in the beginning,
but I don't know about
sustaining sales
or repeat customers.
You know, you want things
that people are gonna
continue to buy.
Yes. And actually,
our pus has ?? is huge for us.
The Pop It Pal Pim??
Pimple Pus,
actually, we have 44%
of our customers
buy our up?sell
at the ?? at checkout.
You know what? I just got it
to work for the first time.
I mean, Lori,
for crying out loud.
I ?? [ Laughs ]
I'm not a pimple popper!
I'm not!
Maybe you're not
a good pimple popper!
Which is gross.
Let's go back.
So what volume do you need ??
what investment
do I have to make
to get it down to $5 a unit?
Bill:
We know with the initial order
that we're gonna make
in the next month,
we can get 'em down to $5.
How many are you gonna make
next month?
30,000.
And that's at $5.
I still find that too expensive.
Why would you price this
at $2.5 million valuation?
I mean,
let's get serious here.
Okay. So, right now, we are
predominantly on online retail,
but our biggest
issue is that
we have such demand
in these other countries.
We're getting contacted
by distributors ??
?Where?
?That makes sense.
Germany and Taiwan...
Ah, the Germans do love
their pimple popping.
?...and the U. K. and Australia.
?So, I have to pay for ??
They're huge, but right now,
we can't ship to them very well.
What does next year look like?
What's next year's sales?
Let's go forward.
We're looking to do
$940,000 this year.
What are you gonna make
on $900,000 in this year?
Ideally, $333,000
off the $940,000.
I think you guys
are wonderful.
And I think you're
in the novelty?gag business.
And I'm in the
practical?solution business,
so it's not for me.
I'm so sorry.
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
It's very intriguing
'cause you have revenue,
and I've always wanted to have
some zits in my portfolio.
So I'll make you an offer.
[ Chuckles ]
I'll give you the $250,000.
Here's the only way I'll do it.
I have no flexibility.
I want $1.50 a unit
until I get $750,000 back.
So it's a straight
royalty deal,
but it's not in perpetuity.
I would like to see the pus
be multiple colors
so I could add blood to it
and other things.
?Ew!
?Make it interesting.
You have indicated that you're
selling these for five bucks,
so I'd like to have
different puses
that I can collect
if I'm into doing this.
?You're into this.
?Yeah, green pus, bloody pus.
But I want 5% of the company
in case somebody buys you out
for this patent
if you ever get issued it.
That's a fantastic offer.
Take it right now.
This is gonna be a multi?billion
dollar category
in the next few years.
We know this.
We're gonna hit
$5 million of revenue
in our first
full calendar year.
We're gonna hit $35 million
of revenue in 2019,
and that's based on ??
?So, the counter is...
15% and 12% are too much
for us just in the valuation.
It's just ?? It's just too rich.
?Okay.
Greiner: And remember, too,
just, you know,
as you counter back, for us,
there is two of us.
?Yep.
?Right.
So, you know,
you want us both in there...
Finally, at something.
...billion?dollar brands
in beverage.
[ Laughter ]
Let me ask a question.
Tell me why these two
are not beverage cockroaches
who are gonna get
crushed by big guys
who want that shelf space back?
The big guys,
what they've done,
is they have
sub?contracted innovation
to the entrepreneurs
of America.
So, very few brands
are being launched
by the big beverage
companies today.
So they're not cockroaches.
They have a chance at survival?
People want to drink beverages
they feel better about.
In this space,
the first thing is,
do you have
a functional story?
