Hey, Sharks,
my name is David Parker.
David: Yumble is
a weekly subscription
that delivers healthy,
fresh, delicious kids' meals
straight to the doors
of busy parents.
No cooking required.
Joanna: Great. David's gonna
pass out some food.
We're ready to Yumble!
Joanna:
What you'll notice on the side
is our welcome packet,
which comes with our deliveries.
It includes a welcome note
for the parents...
Greiner: Thank you.
David: Right, we want you having
skin in the game.
I'll do it at 6%,
$500,000 right now.
Wow!
?Do you have a counter for us?
?Wow.
Because
there's two of us...
I've always admired
everything you do. Thank you.
?Oh, thank you!
?So is that a "yes" or not?
Is that a "yes"?
So, background,
I see the potential,
