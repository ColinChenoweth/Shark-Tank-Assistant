Hey, Sharks, I'm Shahil Patel
from Boston, Massachusetts,
and I'm seeking $375,000
in exchange for 8%
of my business...
Whoa!
...BollyX,
the Bollywood Workout.
Sharks, what you just saw
is traditional Bollywood dance.
Bollywood is the film
industry of India,
and it's full
of dancing and music
that makes you feel
like a rock star.
What if we could combine
the fun, the energy,
the excitement of Bollywood
into a workout?
[ Chuckling ]
I love this guy.
BollyX is building
the world's largest
Bollywood?inspired fitness
platform and community.
We're changing the way America
gets its sweat on,
one shoulder shrug, one cheesy
Bollywood dance move at a time.
?I love it!
?[ Laughs ]
Our classes use high intensity
interval training
and can be found live
at a gym near you,
or you can join us online
with BollyX On Demand
from anywhere at any time.
You can even become
an instructor.
Sharks, we're stepping up
the dance?fitness industry
to a whole?new level,
Bollywood style.
So tell me, who's ready to get
down and shake their moneymaker?
?[ Laughs ]
?Let's do it!
All right, Sharks,
we got a surprise for you.
?Okay, good.
?All right?
You guys are gonna be joining us
for a little Bollywood demo.
?Yay!
?Awesome.
All right, check it out.
Here we go. Here we go.
?Oh, great. I love the hat.
?Love it. I love it.
?Oh, my God.
?We got a hat for you.
I love it. I love it.
All right, guys, I'm gonna
break down a couple quick moves.
So check it out.
Here's what's gonna happen.
We're gonna bend those knees
until your shins are vertical.
Hands up, all right?
We're gonna go down, two,
step with the left.
Three, two, one.
Say, "Huh!"
?Huh!
Down, two, three,
step it back.
Three, two,
let me hear you say...
All: Huh!
All right, level two.
Step. Step. Step, touch.
Nice and easy. Yes. Yes.
Looking good.
Hands up.
Yes.
Pump it up. Here we go!
Go! Go! Go!
Oh, my gosh, my goal is to tire
you out and take all your money.
[ Laughter ]
We end every BollyX class
with a rock?star pose.
?Okay.
?In three...two...one.
?Hey!
?Hey!
All right. Love it.
Awesome job.
?Thank you.
?Round of applause.
Welcome again
to the BollyX fam.
What a workout.
So, we will
catch you guys later.
?Thanks, guys. Oh, man.
?Whoo!
It was a few seconds,
and I feel it.
?So...
?Yep.
Frankel: ...how did
you get into this?
Um, I actually grew up with two
left feet, believe it or not.
No?
Um, growing up, I was actually
supposed to be a doctor.
Of course you were!
[ Laughter ]
Aren't we all?
Yeah. [Chuckles]
And I left to go to college.
I was doing everything
except for Indian stuff.
And my mom was like,
"Hey, why don't you try
something Indian for a change?
Get in touch with your roots."
And I heard about this college
Bollywood dance team.
And I was like,
"I'm gonna surprise my mom."
So, I auditioned for this team,
barely made it.
And I remember
just being super embarrassed.
I went back to my dorm room,
and I would learn some dance
moves off of online videos,
record myself doing it
in front of the camera,
and then compare
the two things side to side...
Ha! That's great.
?Nice.
?...for a year and a half
and straightened out
those two left feet.
?Wow.
?And I led the first?ever
Bollywood dance team
to the semifinals
of "America's Got Talent"...
?Really?
?That's amazing!
...back when "Slumdog
Millionaire" came out. Jai Ho!
So, let's talk numbers.
How many locations do you have?
We teach about
500 classes a week.
?How many locations?
?At how many locations?
?Yeah. About 350.
?350?
?350 locations?
?Yes. Yes.
We actually run
a subscription model,
so we train instructors,
and then we license the brand
and our content, our routines.
And the instructors go out
and teach at different gyms.
And what do they charge,
and how much do you ??
how much do
the instructors keep,
and how much do you get?
So, instructors pay us
$20 a month.
Oh, it's just a straight
subscription service.
Just for the
subscription service
and the ability
to use the brand.
?20 bucks a month is nothing.
?It's not much.
It is, uh ?? so, well, we've got
1,100 paying subscribers.
?Per month? 20 bucks?
?Good for you.
They're paying $20 a month.
We've got roughly $20,000
in that business...
?A month?
?...income. Correct. Per month.
Okay, so ?? so, look,
I get, clearly,
on this panel,
the Bollywood component.
But I have to think
about this as an investor,
and I'm trying to understand
how $20,000 a month
gets me to quite
a sporty valuation.
And that's a fair point.
So, we have ??
we have about $1 million
in lifetime sales.
Our gross margins are about 86%.
We are cash?flow positive.
We actually just crossed that
milestone three months ago.
How many years
have you been in business?
Uh, we've been in business
for five years.
Greiner: Five.
The majority of that revenue
came in the last three years.
That's your only income, the
$20,000 a month, the 20 bucks?
No, no.
So, our vision is to build
the world's biggest
Bollywood?inspired
fitness community.
So, what we've done is
we've started to put out
samples of our content
on channels like YouTube and our
own BollyX On Demand platform.
And we already have 300 paying
customers on that platform.
?How much do they pay a month?
?They pay $9 a month.
So, our real play here
is to utilize the ??
Okay,
that's not bad news at all.
...utilize the on?demand
platform.
Now we're getting
somewhere.
Is the video so good
that it's entertaining
if you like Bollywood?
Yeah, I do have actually
a video example of it.
Yeah, let's see it.
So, you guys actually
just learned these moves.
There's 400 of those routines.
You can pick based on, like,
low intensity, high intensity ??
This model's also proven.
I know people
that pay monthly
just to do their moves
off their mobile device.
You're not as crazy
as I thought.
I appreciate that.
I'm back at the numbers
for a second.
Sure, sure.
Sure, sure, sure.
What was last year?
What did you do all in?
$315,000 last year.
How much did you make
or lose?
Uh, last year,
I think we lost 600 ?? $600K.
?Wait, you lost $600K?
?What?
Well, lost $600K
as in we had ??
we had re?? we invested
$1.7 million into the business.
Doing what?
Building our technology,
building our content.
Building the brand.
Building what technology?
You're doing YouTube videos.
No, no, no.
Our ?? Our platform
that people use
for their instructor.
The at?home ??
the at?home online ??
Yeah, but there's
1,000 white?label VOD
applications out there
and companies
that do it for you.
Well, it's ?? like I said,
we did all the marketing ??
There's nothing
custom about
showing a Bollywood
exercise video.
Who'd you raise
$1.7 million from?
I raised it from friends
and family, all right?
?Well, how much was it?
?$1.7 million.
?$1.7.
?Yeah, $1.7 million.
?Ay!
?I was so excited until now!
Patel: I wish
I could have gotten a deal.
We have a clear plan in place.
We're cash?flow positive.
So, this is actually a time
for us to really be
celebrating BollyX,
and so I'm still
just focused on that.
I was all excited
'til I hear
he blew $1.7 on videos
and training people.
There is something there.
There's something there.
?I know. I agree, too.
?There's something there.
Hey, he got ?? he got Kevin
dancing to Bollywood.
But that valuation
was just crazy.
Oza: 'Cause
it's a start?up.
