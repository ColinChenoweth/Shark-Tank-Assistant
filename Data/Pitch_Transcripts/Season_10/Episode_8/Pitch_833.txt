Hey, Sharks,
my name is David Parker.
And I'm Joanna Parker,
and we're from
Englewood, New Jersey.
Welcome.
?Thank you.
?[ Laughs ]
We're the founders
of Yumble,
and we're here
seeking $500,000
in exchange for 4% of our
rapidly growing business.
?Man!
?Whoa!
Every parent knows
this feeling all too well ??
rushing home
from a crazy day,
frantically cooking
a healthy dinner
your kids absolutely
refuse to eat.
Your kitchen's a mess,
your kids are screaming,
and in the end, you cave,
pulling out processed,
unhealthy food from your freezer
just to make
the temper tantrums stop.
And in the end,
you feel guilty and exhausted.
And that's why
I started Yumble.
David: Yumble is
a weekly subscription
that delivers healthy,
fresh, delicious kids' meals
straight to the doors
of busy parents.
No cooking required.
And every meal
that we deliver
comes with a fun activity
and collectible
to keep the kids
excited and engaged.
So who wants to join us
in taking mealtime stress
off of parents'
plates forever?
?Let's do it!
?You've got some samples.
?Let's get some food.
?Can we get some food?
'Cause I'm a little bit
hungry.
Joanna: Great. David's gonna
pass out some food.
We're ready to Yumble!
Joanna:
What you'll notice on the side
is our welcome packet,
which comes with our deliveries.
It includes a welcome note
for the parents...
Greiner: Thank you.
...to walk them through
the process and the product.
And it also includes
some coins and collectibles
for the children.
?Oh, cute! Are these stickers?
?Those are trading cards.
?Oh!
So, all of you
have the chicken pops.
They taste like chicken nuggets.
They look like cake pops.
But they're made from premium,
antibiotic?free, hormone?free
white meat chicken.
?Very good.
Then you all have one of our
handmade, baked empanadas.
?This empanada's terrific.
?The empanada is excellent.
Mmm!
Then you have
our Smac N' Cheese cups.
Tastes like mac and cheese,
but believe it or not,
It's got as much protein
as a serving of chicken.
Does a plate
come with this?
The plate does not
come with it.
Our meals actually
come in a tray.
And it fits in a lunchbox?
And it can fit
in a lunchbox. Exactly.
Okay, so, this is three meals
a day you're providing?
Parents have a choice
of three different meal plans.
Okay.
They can either order 6 meals,
12 meals, or 24 meals.
Every week, there's
22 different items on the menu
for the customers
to choose from.
O'Leary: You know,
just a few years ago,
we had a company called
"Plated" on "Shark Tank."
They were also
in the meal?kit business.
They actually got sold to
Albertsons for $300 million.
I was their investor.
It was a very interesting ride,
a very challenging one,
but a great outcome.
Now I really know the numbers
of that business...
?Yep.
?...very well.
And so, it's time
to get to the numbers.
So, we have a little bit
more than $1.3 million
in sales already.
Greiner: Wow!
We've been growing at
about a 30?something percent
growth rate
month over month.
And our
customer?acquisition cost
blended over the last
year?to?date is 40 bucks.
How many total subscribers
do you have right now?
?Active customers, we have...
?Active customers, yeah.
?...a few thousand.
?Couple thousand.
How ?? what do you
charge a month?
?It's a weekly subscription.
?It's a weekly subscription.
How much a meal? How much a day?
How much a week?
It ranges right now from
$6.99 a meal to $7.99 a meal.
That includes delivery.
?And shipping and everything?
It includes
all the collectibles.
Yep. Over 70% of our customers
that sign up
order again
their first chance to reorder.
How much do you spend
on advertising and
marketing and promotion?
So, over the first few months,
we were spending, like,
something like $4,000 a week.
?A week? Wow.
?A week.
?So, that's $48,000.
Yeah,
so in the very beginning,
our customer?acquisition
costs were higher.
We were a no?name brand.
We were learning how to
optimize our funnel,
and we were able to get
the customer?acquisition costs
down from $100 down to $40.
?Okay.
So, here's the killer question
that all investors have
for this industry that changed
when Amazon bought Whole Foods
and started acquiring
customers in Whole Foods.
Then Albertsons bought Plated
with 36 million customers
going into all the stores.
How are you going to beat guys
that have brick and mortar
that can solicit
their millions of customers
that go in to buy grocery
to even know about you?
Well, you're not cooking here.
Plated, it's not the same model.
This is gonna compete
with Lunchables.
The way to ??
the way to measure it ??
No, I'm gonna talk also!
?This goes against ??
?Wait a second. When ?? When ??
At least the lunch.
Beth is a lunch ??
I'd like to say
something, Kevin!
We got to get an answer to that.
But ?? But it's not your world.
It's not Plated.
It is to compete with
Lunchables. And I am
a mother, and I want ??
You're not getting the
customer?acquisition issue.
I'm talking about the fact
that you're talking about
what's going to happen
in a supermarket.
You keep talking about it
like it's the same thing.
No, but you understand
why that occurred?
Why what occurred?
Because look. Blue Apron's
stock got cut by 78%
within a week after Amazon
bought Whole Foods.
Cuban: Yep. IPO.
He knows exactly
what I'm talking about.
It is not
apples to apples.
I know what you're talking
about. I just think that
it's different.
I know what you're
talking about, but ??
I think there's
a huge difference...
?Why are you different?
?...and I think, Bethenny,
you probably are kind of
trying to articulate it.
?Thank you.
?[ Laughs ]
We are serving to parents,
and they're not just
walking into a supermarket
and grabbing a meal tha??
?You're very right.
?No, i?it's an ??
From a consumer standpoint,
you're very right.
Branding standpoint,
you're right.
Kevin's point is that
if you don't, at some point,
figure out a retail
partnership strategy,
you will get whacked because the
number?one player went out there
and got destroyed on market cap,
and it just keeps going south.
David and Joanna have one offer
from Bethenny for their
kids' meal?subscription
business Yumble.
But Rohan is also interested
and would like
to partner with Lori.
Greiner: The food is great.
Tried it.
Thank you.
I love your packaging.
Like, everything you're doing
is spot?on and smart.
Um, Rohan is genius
at building brands.
And I think that
the two of us together
could do really
great things for you.
So, I would like to go in
on his offer 'cause I ??
you made me fall in love
with you and it.
I would like
to say one more thing.
My other job on another show
is 23 weeks with moms,
3 million moms,
18 to 49.
Okay, they both have merit...
250,000 plus,
4 years of college...
...in terms of how they could
promote you. You get it.
...the whole thing.
Stop selling. You got it.
You got two offers.
What are you gonna do?
Talk us through
your thinking, guys.
Okay, so,
here's our thinking.
David: Right, we want you having
skin in the game.
I'll do it at 6%,
$500,000 right now.
Wow!
?Do you have a counter for us?
?Wow.
Because
there's two of us...
I've always admired
everything you do. Thank you.
?Oh, thank you!
?So is that a "yes" or not?
Is that a "yes"?
So, background,
I see the potential,
and I get,
you've got...
Right now, or I'm going out.
...money stacked there
that you have to ??
Right now.
I'm not playing around.
H?Hold on a second. I see that
you have money stacked there...
You have to give him
the consideration because
this is their life.
...ahead of you.
And this is a big decision
for you guys to make.
I'm gonna go. I'm out.
O'Leary: Ouch.
You're out?
