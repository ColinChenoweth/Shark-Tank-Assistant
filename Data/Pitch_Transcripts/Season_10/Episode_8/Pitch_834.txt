Hi, Sharks,
I'm Allison Ellsworth.
And I'm Stephen Ellsworth.
And together,
we're the co?founders
of Mother Beverage
based in Dallas, Texas.
We're here
seeking $400,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
All right, Sharks, who wants
to take a shot with me?
?Shot time!
?Always.
Who wants to take a shot?
Shots?
Ooh.
We put shots down
in front of you.
See who's brave.
?Are we really gonna shot it?
?Do we get a flavor?
?No toast?
?Ready? Cheers.
?[ Laughs ]
?Ooh!
[ Coughs ]
?Oh, it's apple cider vinegar.
?[ Coughs ]
?Pbht!
?Aah.
?Whoo!
?[ Coughs ]
Oh, my God.
?So, as you guys know by now,
that was a shot
of apple cider vinegar.
Oh, my God!
Well, I started drinking
apple cider vinegar, or ACV,
to detox and lose weight.
I loved the way it made me feel,
but the taste was so strong.
So, we created...
Mother Beverage.
Mother Beverage
is an all?natural,
sparkling probiotic drink
made with organic
fruits and herbs,
and, most importantly,
apple cider vinegar.
They're light,
crisp, refreshing,
and the best part ??
there's only two to four grams
of sugar per bottle.
So, what do you say, Sharks?
Are you ready to try
the best?tasting
apple cider vinegar
drink you've ever had?
Cheers to your health!
Cheers to your health!
I'm still dying.
Well, we've got some samples
here for you today.
Yeah, you'd better ?? you need
to give us some samples.
You needed something
to compare to.
This is much better. I promise.
?I'm still tearing.
Yeah, you should have
warned us, though.
?Seriously.
?Yeah, it's strong.
You can have this shot.
Would you like another?
Oh, I think
I'm quite all right.
Thank you very much.
I'll take one of these
lovely beverages, though.
[ Air hisses ]
Thank you.
It doesn't taste
as crappy as the shot.
Well, I could taste
the vinegar in it.
It tastes like a sparkling,
sugary soda.
Allison: That's the idea.
So, our top sellers
are lime ginger...
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
...raspberry rose...
This is the best one.
...our pineapple turmeric,
and blueberry sage.
So, how much
apple cider vinegar is in here?
So, there's a tablespoon
of apple cider vinegar. So ??
And what will that
do for you?
There's a ton of great health
benefits to apple cider vinegar.
Allison has a personal
story about that.
She started drinking it
to detox and to lose weight.
So, if you dilute ACV,
does the function of the
apple cider vinegar still stand?
Allison: Yes.
Or is it pretty much
like you've subdued it?
So, they recommend
to dilute it
because if you just
take it straight, like,
it's hard on your esophagus,
and it's hard on your stomach.
Ours is fully
unpasteurized.
So you want to make
sure it still has all
the health benefits...
Yes.
...intact.
So we've just prepared like,
a pre?made healthy go?to option
to get your daily dose
of apple cider vinegar.
So, let's just grant you that it
all works as advertised, right?
Does it still function? Exactly.
Tell us about ??
tell us about the business.
But is it that ?? Oh, sorry.
So, we started
about 18 months ago.
Our lifetime sales
are about $500,000.
What are you gonna
make this year all in?
So, we're projecting
$1 million.
We just received placement
in over 200 locations
in a large national
grocery chain.
Is it Whole Foods?
We are in Whole Foods locally
in the Dallas?Fort Worth area.
But it was
actually Albertsons.
How much is
this bottle retail?
So, it retails
for $2.99 to $3.59
based on the
retailer's margin.
What's the cost
to make the product?
So, the cost is
anywhere between 78 cents
and 85 cents
a bottle all in.
That's pretty good
for the volumes you have.
The only way I get
out of this thing alive
is somebody buys you
at some point.
?Sure.
?There's an exit, right?
?Yes, sir.
?And that exit in beverage
seems to be at
around $50 million.
When you establish
some regional market share,
the big guys come
and take you out
as opposed to
doing this themselves
'cause what you're doing,
there's nothing
proprietary about this.
Anybody can knock you off.
But we happen to have
an expert here who built...
Allison: We do
have a great story.
We both worked in oil and gas
before we did this,
and I was having
a ton of health issues.
I kept going
to different doctors.
I just was sluggish,
bloating, skin problems.
Finally, I read online that
drinking apple cider vinegar
could help with
a lot of those problems.
Within two weeks,
everything had subsided,
but I could not
get over the taste,
so I literally went back
to my kitchen and created this.
We started selling
at farmers markets
and actually,
the Whole Foods buyer
tried our product
at the farmers market
and said, "You guys
have to be in Whole Foods."
Are you now full?time
into the vinegar deal?
?Full?time.
?How much have you invested?
So, currently,
we've raised about $125,000.
At what valuation?
So, that was at
a $600,000 valuation.
And that was pre?concept.
And now you're worth
$4 million?
$4 million?
That was pre?revenue,
based on concept.
That was friends and family.
So a majority of that money
was to literally start
our production facility.
So, you manufacture
this yourself?
?Yes, sir.
?Yes.
How big can you get on your
current manufacturing footprint?
Stephen:
60,000 bottles a month.
But we do ??
we have already started
to finance a fully
automated bottling line.
And this will take us up
to 200,000 bottles a week.
But why would you want to be
in the manufacturing business?
I ?? That's what I'm ??
I just can't believe you guys ??
?Our costs ??
?That's a disaster.
It keeps our costs down.
We are able ??
Yeah, but you're in the mud.
You're in the weeds.
but they are concerned
that Stephen and Allison
are opting to manufacture
their apple cider vinegar
product,
Mother Beverage, on their own
as opposed to using a co?packer.
Why would you want to be
in the manufacturing business?
I ?? That's what I'm ?? I just
can't believe you guys ??
?Our costs ??
?That's a disaster.
It keeps our costs down.
Yeah, but you're in the mud.
You're in the weeds.
The reason that we don't
co?pack, we wanted to keep
it raw and unpasteurized.
I will tell you that
if I did not do a deal
in my cocktail business,
I would have gotten swallowed.
Everybody did copy me.
By now, everybody's copied me.
Right. Everyone knocked
you off.
And I knew I needed
muscle and distribution.
You need to come in
hot and hard and fast,
and you need a partner 'cause
you're still in the kitchen.
You're not even at phase
zero where you have someone
else doing it for you.
So you need to get
the hell out of the kitchen,
and you need
to start a business,
not an artisanal mom?and?pop
beverage business. I'm out.
You're not fully
cockroaches yet.
You're sort of larvae.
You're just starting.
And it's so early,
and you haven't gone through
any of the pressures
of marketing by the big guys
as they give you shelf space.
The thing is,
is with little marketing,
we have the points
of distribution.
Every beverage guy
comes in here,
and the future's so bright,
we got to wear shades.
But you're still
vinegar roaches.
The valuation's insane.
I'm out.
Cuban: Yeah, the problem
is there's no such thing
as just a little marketing.
The hard part
is the scaling part
and taking people's
attention and sales
away from other products.
You're gonna have to raise
a lot more money after this,
and that's the part
I'm concerned about.
And so, as much as I would love
to help a Dallas company,
I'm out.
?Okay, thank you.
?Thank you.
I like it. It's great
that it's low calorie.
Um, my only concern is
just struggling
with the competitive edge.
I see your vision,
but I don't think
that you have gotten there yet.
For me, I'll be a customer,
but I won't be a partner.
I'm out.
?Thank you for that.
Well, there's one shark left.
Then there was one.
?Yeah.
?And in the beverage business.
Oza: But actually,
I'm not smart enough
to have created
my own beverage ever.
I find smart entrepreneurs,
um, and I partner with them.
And they're the ones who have
the vision for the brand,
but I've become the number?one
consigliere for them.
So, I'm gonna give you an offer.
?Whoa, kitty!
?Yes!
Gonna give you an offer.
But the valuation is not
what you're gonna want it to be.
Beverage is savage.
As Bethenny will tell you,
I'll tell you, it's savage.
The mathematics
for a company that,
this year,
has done $250,000,
if we take it 12 months,
you're at...
$360,000.
Let's even round it up
to $400,000.
That puts you at
a $1.6?odd million valuation.
So, for $400,000,
for me to get interested,
it's got to be more like...
25%.
Guys, that is a ridiculously
good offer for you.
I would have never ??
?Run.
Run like a thief in the night.
?It is. It's very intriguing.
You ?? You have to take that.
