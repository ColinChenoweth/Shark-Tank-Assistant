Hey, Sharks.
My name is Zach Brown.
And my name
is Alyssa Brown.
We are from
Newington, Connecticut,
and we are seeking $150,000
in exchange for 5%
of our company,
Moki Doorstep.
Wow.
Sharks, at a mere
five feet tall,
I've always been
vertically challenged,
but most of the time, it doesn't
seem to hold me back.
I mean, being short
even has some perks,
like being the champ
at limbo...
[ Laughter ]
...or getting that prime,
front?row spot
in the group photos.
Plus, I never hit my head
on anything, unlike Zach.
This is true,
but there's one thing
Alyssa has always
struggled with.
We are an
outdoor?loving couple,
and most weekends
start off with us
loading up a kayak or skis
to go find an adventure.
Alyssa has never
been able to
easily secure the gear
on the roof of a car.
We didn't want that hassle
holding us back.
Plus, once we looked around,
a lot of other people st??
struggled, much like us.
But struggle no more,
because we've invented
the Moki Doorstep.
The Moki Doorstep is a vehicle
rooftop?assistance device.
This gives you that
quick and easy step up
to the top of your car.
Let me show you guys
how it works.
This hooks on in one second
to the striker of the vehicle,
which is standard
on most cars.
And I'm up just as quick.
?Huh.
?Wow.
?Who thinks of these things?
?Interesting.
?That's smart.
?We do! [ Chuckles ]
It unhooks just as quick
without any hassle.
[ Car door closes ]
So, whether you are
loading up
a mountain bike,
securing your family's
Christmas tree,
or clearing a foot of snow off
from that last storm,
Moki Doorstep is here
to give you the boost you need.
So, Sharks,
who wants to step up
to your next adventure
with Moki Doorstep?
Which short Shark wants
to come give it a try?
[ Laughter ]
We've got a sample for you.
?The shortest one.
?I'm a short Shark.
?Well, come on!
?But I'm in heels.
?Robert!
?Hey, it's a good challenge.
All right, we'll see.
[ Laughs ]
?Ah.
?Got a sample for you, sir.
Can I do it in heels?
That's all right. We'll ?? We'll
pick someone else if you can't.
Here's a sample.
Thank you.
Herjavec: Wow. It's solid.
John: [ Chuckling ] It is ??
This is a great idea.
?Great idea. Congrats.
?Thank you, sir.
Greiner: Okay.
Alyssa: So, you're gonna
hold it down like this.
And you're gonna just hook
underneath right there.
Oh.
Look at you.
Pretty cool.
The ingenuity
in America amazes me.
?This is great.
?Thank you, sir.
Who would have thought
somebody would think of this?
There you go, Lori.
Here's yours.
?Oh, thank you.
?You're welcome.
Like, how did you even...
So, I'm an
emergency?room nurse.
Zach's a firefighter.
?Ahh.
?Oh.
?Whoo?whoo!
?Thanks. I mean ??
So, being a firefighter,
we use the Jaws of Life.
And we always try
to open the door this way.
And that bolt right there,
per standards,
has to hold 2,200 pounds,
so it's extremely strong.
So, using that knowledge,
I said,
"Hey, we can create
a device to step on it
to make access
much easier."
?That's very smart.
?Wow.
Cuban: So, what are your sales?
So, we did a Kickstarter
campaign back in January.
We ran a 30?day campaign,
and we did $110,000
worth of sales.
Wow.
What are you selling them for?
What does it cost you to make?
So, we tol?? We sold them
at a camping show,
between $40 and $50 to try
to figure out our price point.
Either prices hold
equally as well.
Our landed cost
is $10.50 for it.
So, what did you do annually?
So, we've only done
the $116,000 in sales.
Oh, you've only done
Kickstarter.
So, we only did the Kickstarter
and the camping show.
?You only did Kickstarter. Okay.
?I see.
So we're not
selling currently
because we're back?ordered
from the other ones.
?About 33 days.
?Is this patented?
?Patent pending.
?Yes.
Sorry, Lori. I had ??
I know somebody who did
something very similar.
?You do?
?Yeah.
What was similar?
Well, when I was growing up,
this guy in my neighborhood
named Pookie ??
?Oh, Lord.
?[ Laughter ]
He had these ??
these bunch of pedals
that he used to put
in his pockets,
so every time he, you know,
did something wrong,
when the cops would chase him,
he would put them
into the gates.
It was called the Pookie step.
?[ Laughs ]
And he would just
get over the gate like that.
?[ Laughs ]
?He's doing 2 to 5 right now.
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: And his name is Pookie?
?It's called the Pookie step.
?Pookie!
The Pookie step.
Uh, why is it called the Moki?
The Pueblo Indians
would build Moki steps.
They would kind of
carve them out into the walls.
?Oh.
?Oh.
So, that way, they could
kind of scurry up the walls.
So, let's quickly
get at the numbers here.
$150,000 for 5% imputes
a $3 million valuation.
That sounds a little rich
for something you just launched.
I need a Moki Step
to get to that.
So...
So, we actually had a CFO of
a very large auto?parts company,
and he actually told us
we'd be crazy
to value under $4 million.
?[ Laughs ]
?So...
You know what I love
about guys like that?
They're not writing checks.
I?I agree,
but on top of that,
we've also been talking
to a rack company, and they ??
we have a term sheet
for a licensing agreement
for North America.
A rap company?
?A rack company.
?Oh, "rack."
Yep. He wants to do
a 7?year deal.
Minimums would be
$3 million for that 7 years.
?You will make $3 million?
?Yes.
Herjavec:
On royalties to you?
O'Leary: What's he gonna
pay you in royalties ?? 7%?
Actually, 12.5%, sir.
that Zach and Alyssa must pay
a royalty to Zach's uncle
for helping them
launch Moki Step,
a step to help
reach the top of vehicles.
It's for 18 more years.
?18 more years?
?18 more years?
If you do the distribution deal
with the 12.5% royalty to it,
does that cut you off
from selling it anywhere else?
So, that deal would just be
a North American deal.
So the rest of the world's
still out there.
I wouldn't pay
50 bucks for this.
I would pay $19.95,
maybe less.
Within months, you're gonna see
knock?offs on this.
You should be trying to figure
out how to make it for less
because someone else
is gonna do it.
I'm out.
Zach, I think you should
take the distribution deal.
There's no risk to you.
?Alyssa.
?Yes?
How does it feel
to be a millionaire?
I don't know!
[ Laughter ]
Riding all the way
to the bank, baby.
?Yeah!
?Yeah! Whoo!
Whoo!
?All right.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Yes. Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Whoo!
?Holy...
Hey, good job.
Oh, my God.
Alyssa: We've enjoyed
running the business,
but we really enjoy our jobs
and being with our family,
so we can
make money off of it
and go back
to our normal lives.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
That's awesome.
Oh, my God.
Whew.
[ Both laugh ]
[ Sniffles ] That's wild.
Daymond,
I got bad news for you.
What? What's that?
Mr. Wonderful is gonna
knock this off
and sell it for nine bucks,
and you can sue me
all over town if you want.
So that brown pouch
is the filter with the straw,
and it can hang ??
?How much does that sell for?
That sells for between
$15 and $20.
Cuban: Can we see that?
So, anybody could use
their own mason jar.
Exactly. Yeah, so,
any wide?mouth mason jar.
You can find it at practically
any grocery store.
What does it cost you
to make it?
It costs us right now
$4 to make it in that package,
and with scale,
that's gonna drop to $1.50
with the new two?cavity mold.
So, we're selling it
online right now.
Big?box retail is what
we're aiming for in
the next year, and ??
Where would you want to be
in a big?box retail store?
So, this product
would do very well in,
you know, something like
a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or a Target.
Herjavec: Do you
have competition?
There are other
cold?brew coffee makers.
They range anywhere
between $50 and $250.
And what do they do?
So, there's one that you put on
your counter and you add it ??
You know, it's this big,
and you put it on your counter,
and it sits, and there's
a valve at the bottom
to, you know, filter it.
There's really nothing
that's designed
for somebody using a mason jar
that just wants to do it...
