Hi, Sharks.
My name is Paul Toback.
I'm Steve Lenz, and our company
is Sproing Fitness.
We're from Chicago, Illinois,
and we're seeking
a $500,000 investment
for an 8% stake in our company.
?Wow.
Sharks, running remains the most
popular form of cardio workout,
but with 85% of runners
injured every year,
as runners ourselves,
we had to ask,
"What are we doing wrong?"
The short answer is,
we're running the wrong way.
And ?? spoiler alert ??
the treadmill is a big part
of the problem.
Everybody that runs has to fall
forward in order to move.
But, in the case
of a treadmill,
the ground is moving
underneath you,
making it virtually
impossible to fall forward.
Instead, the treadmill
causes you to land
out ahead of your body
on your heel,
pounding your knees, your hips,
your back, your ankles.
This is the number?one cause
of injury in runners.
We knew there
had to be a better way,
so we reinvented
the treadmill.
Introducing Sproing...
?Ta?da.
?Whoo?hoo!
...the first new running machine
in over 100 years.
Sproing replaces the treadmill's
hard wooden deck
with a soft, impact?absorbing
air cushion
and lets you feel like
you're running on the beach.
?[ Laughs ]
?Our rear?tether system
allows you to fall forward
and simulate real running.
No more dangerous
moving belts.
But we recognized with Sproing
we had a bigger opportunity
than just selling
fitness equipment,
so we leveraged
the versatility of Sproing
to break
into the studio market,
opening studios in Chicago,
Houston, and Baltimore.
Sharks, Sproing is the next
big thing in fitness.
Now everybody can train hard
and land soft.
We hear you all
are a little competitive.
So who's ready
to come on down
for a little friendly
competition, Sproing style?
?I'll try!
?Me!
?Thank you. Appreciate it.
?Yay!
?Hey!
?Come on in!
All right, we got
some shoes for you all.
Daymond, hold my jacket.
Thank you.
Okay.
[ Laughter ]
Daymond, you want
to do this one?
Lenz: Yeah. Come on over here.
Wrap around your waist there.
?Okay.
?Oh, it's full?on.
Yeah.
I'm a lot thinner
than Daymond's should be.
[ Laughs ]
Okay, both of you, here we go.
Out at the end. Ready?
We're gonna do it
like a real class.
We run intervals.
Let's start running now.
Jog out.
?Hold these, or...?
?No, you can, but go ahead.
?Keep the chest up.
?10 seconds! Let's go!
Chest up. Chest up. Chest up.
?10, 9...
Going in 5, 4, 3,
...2, 1.
?There you go. Knees up.
?Stop. Stop.
?It's not moving.
?There you go. Yeah.
?No.
It's not a treadmill.
Lenz: Don't ?? Don't kick
the heels back.
Knees forward.
Whoa!
[ Laughs ] You're moving.
Whoa!
?So, we want you ??
?I'm basically running in spot?
Toback:
Well, think about it.
When you're running
on a treadmill,
you're not moving
anywhere, either.
This is the same thing.
All right, turn around.
Inside the belt, we're gonna
show you some versatility.
Okay, now we're
doing squat rows.
Okay, now, grab this.
?So ??
?Will it hold me?
Yeah.
This holds up to 3,000 pounds.
You cannot pull out of it.
We got NFL guys,
NBA guys on this.
What am I doing?
You're gonna come
down into that squat.
We're gonna have you do a squat.
And then come
all the way back up and row.
And then pull. Yeah.
Cuban: Don't rip your pants,
Daymond.
Go ahead. Do it again.
?Wow.
?Pull. Yeah.
You know,
I really feel that.
We're doing intervals of cardio,
strength, and power.
We're changing every 30 seconds,
which is called tabata style,
the most effective way
to get your heart rate up.
We are running classes
with 60 intervals in 30 minutes.
?Thank you.
?10?minute warm?up,
5?minute cool?down.
So, in 45 minutes, you can burn
up to 1,000 calories.
It seems like they'd
be exhausted, though,
in 45 minutes, right?
Herjavec:
I got to tell you, you ??
I thought it was
a bit of a joke.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's ??
it's a great workout.
?It's a real workout, yes.
?We get that a ?? We get that.
Why couldn't I simply
buy the mat
without all the rest of the ??
which must be very expensive,
and just put it in my facility
with the two belts
that already exist?
Why not just sell the ??
What's it called, the Sproing?
Why ?? Like,
I don't even get this.
Because once you
go down that path,
you automatically get
to the end where we did, right?
You start with,
"Let's just put a mat down."
Well, you need
a rear tether system.
And I ?? I ran into a guy once.
He said the same thing to me.
He said, "I'm gonna
put a mat in my yard."
I said, "Okay. Try it."
He goes, "Yeah, but then I need
to know how fast I'm going, so,"
he goes, "I need a footfall
sensor to figure it out."
He goes,
"Then I need a count."
I go, "Great. You're gonna end
right where we are."
?How much does this cost?
?You need the whole machine.
If I want to buy one for my gym,
how much?
$6,499.
?Oh, my...
?Whew!
It is right
in the sweet spot.
Commercial treadmills run
anywhere between $3,000 ??
So, it's a high?end
treadmill, very.
No. I used to be the CEO
of Bally Total Fitness.
Nice.
So we have depth
in this industry.
We have knowledge.
You do not see this anywhere.
So, can ?? can we ask
Daymond and Robert ??
how did you feel just running in
place? What did you think?
Well, it's like running in sand,
and it's really hard.
Like, it gets harder and harder
as you do it.
It ?? It's a great
workout, Paul.
Thank you.
My challenge I was having there
is, on a treadmill,
you take it up,
you take it down.
You turn on the TV on there,
and you watch it
if you're walking in place
or doing other things.
This is for intense.
?Yeah.
?This is like ??
Yeah, Paul, that's
my problem with it.
I'm not gonna do this
for 45 minutes.
Here's the focus
we have right now.
Okay.
We are opening studios,
high?intensity ??
Sorry. So, let's ??
let's stop right there.
Sure.
You came out here
selling the machine,
but you're actually
selling studios now.
When I left Bally, I wanted
to invent a brand?new machine.
There's only been five pieces
of cardio equipment
ever invented ??
treadmill, elliptical, stepper,
bike, rower. That's it.
But how did you go
from this to a studio?
So, we went out,
and we started to
sell equipment.
How much of it
did you sell?
We sold about $1 million
worth of equipment.
That was in
a two?year period.
We were meeting more resistance
than we thought, right?
This story has a ??
Yeah, you're meeting
guys like me
that are very skeptical
about this.
Steve was the former head
of engineering at Life Fitness.
Yes.
He has more
treadmill patents,
more elliptical patents,
than any human being
on this planet.
And I was the biggest
buyer of treadmills.
So, what was the roadblock?
The treadmill manufacturers
have no incentive to innovate.
Here's what the health?club
owners said ??
"Eh, nobody's asked me
for this yet."
So, then who bought it?
We got ?? We got some traction
in, uh, rehab centers.
We got some traction
in private training studios.
And we said, "You know what?
The uptake isn't
as fast as we'd like."
And all we kept saying
to ourselves was,
"Look, if we were still
running our company,
this is an amazing product
that would give us
a competitive edge.
We would replace
treadmills with this."
Got it. So, you said,
"We're gonna open up studios."
"We're gonna
open up studios."
How many studios
have you opened?
We've got four open
right now, in Chicago ??
O'Leary: Only with these
machines in them?
?Yes, sir.
?Yes.
Are you making any money
in those studios?
The first full year
that we ran our Chicago club,
we had $400,000
worth of sales.
How much have you
invested in this,
and how much outside money
have you also brought in?
Yeah, 'cause that's
a complicated ??
So, we've got about $2 million
of our own money into this.
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
?You're all?in.
?Your own money?
?Our own money. Our own money.
?We are all?in.
?Here's the problem.
?Uh?huh.
When I go to SoulCycle,
it's fun, it's intense,
it's motivating.
?Right.
?This isn't fun.
Okay, all due respect,
this is SoulCycle with running.
Here's wh??
?But how?!
?So, that's what the class is.
It's a 45?minute class.
There's 25 machines.
What we didn't get here
is the lights come down,
the music goes up,
the instructor's standing
in front of you ?? "Let's go."
I sense your passion,
and that's great, okay?
Yeah.
I actually look at this
and say to myself,
"It's a dog."
You got to take it
behind the barn and shoot it.
?[ Laughs ]
?I was waiting for that.
?It's a fact.
?It's not a fact.
You stand in those clubs,
and you watch the hundreds
and then thousands of people
who've come through.
?Oh, okay.
Cuban: Look, guys,
I would take this class.
When I go to Chicago,
I'll check it out.
?It's great.
?Good.
The challenge
for all of these,
they go like this,
and then everybody gets bored,
and then they move
to the next thing,
you know, just like
SoulCycle had its moment,
Barry's Bootcamp...
?Right.
?...Rise Nation, right?
?Right.
Some of them stay longer,
but the bigger part
of the problem is,
because you're so
equipment?driven,
it's gonna be harder for you
to adapt and change
in the future
as people's
expectations change,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Mark,
I appreciate that,
and thank you
for hearing our story.
I would just say this.
We have had amazing results,
and the people
who take it love it.
Well ??
Greiner: I get what
you're trying to do,
but I like consumer products.
I like it to be broader.
It's not a deal for me.
I'm out.
?Okay.
?All right, thanks, Lori.
I think that,
looking at your history,
you're not two bobos that
fell off a turnip truck, right?
Right.
You're, like, a guy who ran
the top retail, and then you ??
So, why is it worth
over $6 million?
Well, I'ma tell ?? I'ma tell you
why it's worth over $6 million.
Why?
Because they're both
very connected experts.
They've seen everything.
They've put in $2 million
of their own capital, and...
So?
...they are saying where
it's going to go next.
Why isn't it worth
$10 million, Daymond?
Let him finish.
Let him finish.
It could be, but I'm just
telling you my opinion.
So, here is my ??
here is my point.
Just 'cause
they have experience?
Here ?? Here is my point.
Okay.
There's a lot of education
that's going to
have to make people aware
of this new type of workout.
I wouldn't be able to help you
where it's going
'cause you're the only one
with the passion
and the experience and the money
in there to do this yourselves,
so I'm out.
Toback: We think
the Sharks totally missed it.
We think this is a
billion?dollar opportunity,
and we think that
they just didn't see
where this could go
and how fast it can scale.
And so it's their loss,
and we're sorry
they didn't see it, but wait.
This is gonna be
an amazing company.
This sucks!
Are you kidding?
What about a treadmill?
This is better, from 1954.
