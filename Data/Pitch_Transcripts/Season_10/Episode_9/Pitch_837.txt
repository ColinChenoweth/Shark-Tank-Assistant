Hi, Sharks.
My name is Max Feber,
I'm from Detroit, Michigan,
and I'm seeking $50,000
for 25% of my company, BRUW.
I've perfected a new way to make
cold?brew coffee at home
without the need for complicated
or overpriced equipment.
When I was just 15 years old,
I fell in love with coffee.
I tried making ??
?[ Laughing ] At 15?
?15.
I tried making it, roasting it.
I did everything I could
to learn more about it.
One day, I stumbled across
cold?brew coffee,
and I was dying to try it.
If you're not familiar
with cold?brew,
it's a type of coffee
that's made in cold water
instead of hot water.
This doesn't extract the acidity
out of the coffee bean,
so it's smoother, it's sweeter,
and some even find that
it's easier on their stomachs.
After watching
countless videos online,
I found that people
use mason jars
to make it themselves
at home all the time.
?Hmm.
?So that's what I tried.
I took ground coffee
and cold water,
and I put it in a jar to let it
sit in my fridge for 24 hours.
Then I tried to filter it.
I used a cheesecloth,
a pour?over, paper towels.
It just went everywhere.
It made this whole mess
all over my counter.
My parents were mad,
I didn't have my coffee,
and I wasn't about to spend
hundreds of dollars
on a complicated cold?brew
coffee maker.
I knew there had to be
a better way.
So I ran into my garage,
I ripped a screen door
off the wall,
I grabbed a hot?glue gun,
some mason?jar lids,
and after some trial and error,
the first prototype
of BRUW was born.
Obviously, we've come
a long way since then.
So, let me show you
how it works.
First, you take some
ground coffee and cold water,
and you combine it
in a standard mason jar.
So, I'm just gonna fill it
all the way to the top
with the water,
and just a little bit of coffee
at the bottom's
really all you need.
Now I'm gonna put it in my
fridge to let it sit overnight.
That's really fast. Wow.
[ Laughter ]
So, now you take
the double?sided BRUW filter,
and you insert it
straw?side down
into the mason jar with coffee.
All right.
Good job, Max.
Can we try it, Max?
?Of course.
?Yeah.
I have some samples for you.
[ Quickly ] Do you think Max
is a little hyper 'cause of
drinking so much coffee?
I ??
[ Laughter ]
?Max, I have a question.
?Of course.
?How old are you now?
?I'm 18 years old now.
So, you have
a cold?brew coffee
that I actually made
in my hotel room last night...
How ??
...because of how easy
the system is to use.
You made this 24 hours ago?
?24 hours ago.
?Okay.
I have the sugar cubes,
and I have some milk.
But, Max, I'm Croatian.
We like our coffee ??
So fill it up
all the way to the top,
just a drop of water.
You can just chew
on the grounds. It'll...
?[ Laughs ]
?Okay, so, how many people
actually go to the trouble
of making cold?brew coffee?
Feber: I know that a lot
of large coffee retailers
have recently switched over
to cold?brew coffee.
Peet's Coffee
has entirely changed
from iced coffee to cold?brew.
I know Starbucks is
selling cold?brew now in
addition to iced coffee,
and they're both selling
at $2 to $3 more than a normal
cup of iced coffee is.
Max, are you selling
the filter or the bottles?
Okay, our number?one
best?selling product
is that filter right there.
Max, I get the sense that
you're running at about 115%
and drinking a lot
of the product.
[ Laughter ]
Let's ?? I?I'm not kidding.
And I'm not saying
that's a bad thing,
but the numbers don't lie.
Why don't you tell us what ??
what you've sold?
Last year,
we did $50,000 in revenue.
Okay.
And this year we're on track
to do $100,000 in revenue.
So, Max, are you
gonna go to college?
I'm in college.
I just finished my first year.
?Where at?
?Babson College.
?Babson!
?There you go.
I'm majoring in business.
Let me ask you this.
So, you're 18 years old.
How long have you been
watching "Shark Tank"?
Since I was about 8 years old.
?[ Laughs ]
?Wow!
Watching "Shark Tank," I learned
how to run a business, right?
You see entrepreneurs
stand here, and they're,
you know, doing something
that might not be the smartest,
and they just
get roasted for it.
[ Laughter ]
And that's okay.
And so I'm taking the lessons
that you are telling
other entrepreneurs
and applying them
to this business.
The most inspiring thing
about being a Shark ??
50% of the people that
come up to us are kids.
And they're learning
the language of business.
And look at you.
You ?? You've taken that.
It's just so inspiring
to be a Shark
and to help people that way.
And he's augmented
with coffee ?? a lot of it.
[ Laughter ]
So, I have a question.
Do you have a patent?
Yeah, Max! Yeah, Max!
?That is very hard to ??
?They did it? They did it?
That's what we call
the power of broke. I love it.
Max, maybe it's the coffee,
but you're really a dynamo.
I mean, you're coming
out here blasting.
Love the fact you've been
a fan for a decade.
Mm?hmm.
But it's not a company.
It's a product.
You're not even a full CEO
because you're in school.
I'll give you the, um ??
the 50K. I want 50%.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.
?How much is it?
?Dang!
Mind if I hear
the rest of the room?
You didn't have an offer
two seconds ago. Now you do.
Well, I feel that this isn't
gonna be your big hit product.
I think you have
a lot more in you.
You're so smart ??
and you're only 18 ??
that I think
there's gonna be lots more,
and it only takes one.
It's a good idea,
but for me not the right
investment, so I'm out.
Thank you.
Herjavec: Max, tell me
what happens on day two.
$50,000 in the bank. Go.
So, we have the $50,000.
As soon as we have that,
we kick off the production
to get the cost of this
down dramatically.
But do you really think
that your problem is cost?
I do. If we have this made
and landed for $1.50
and we can sell this for $4.99
on a store shelf,
I think, you know, su??
that's such a convenience buy.
Max, I'm so torn with this
because I?I like you.
One of my top companies,
Bombas Socks ??
they're from Babson.
They started off doing $800,000.
They're valued
at $150 million right now.
So I know you're gonna
figure it out.
But you don't know retail,
and you want to try
to get into retail.
Herjavec:
Max, I?I love the hustle,
but I'm worried it's gonna be
a part?time thing for you.
So, I'm working on this
all the time, all day.
No, I know you are, but ??
I walk out of class,
I sit at my computer,
and I'm working on this.
Nonstop, I'm running this.
?I respect the hustle.
I don't know if this
is a full?time business.
For that reason, I'm out.
?Appreciate it. Thank you.
Max, okay, so, when you look
at your gross margins,
you're selling it for $20
and making it for $4, right?
So you're $16
in gross margins.
So, why would you want
to take your margins down ??
even if you get your cost
down to $1.50, right,
and sell it for $5
when you're making
enormous margins right now?
So, I'm still interested
in selling it at these
enormous margins.
Obviously,
it's a good price,
and people are buying it
at this price.
Right.
But I think that if this
was hanging in a store
at the register for $5.99,
$8.99, whatever it is,
and someone says,
"Oh, let me make some cold ??
You know,
I make cold?brew coffee,
I've heard of cold?brew
coffee ??"
But, again, why do you want
to sell more to make less?
So, I do just think
it'll be an impulse buy.
I think we're gonna
get more volume of sales.
I think more people are gonna be
buying this at the register.
More people will be
buying this online.
Max, you could test it.
Your assumptions may be wrong.
You could test it.
Look, I love when little
mini?mes come out here, right?
[ Laughter ]
I?I can see it.
I can feel it.
So, I like what you're doing.
?Thank you.
I like the higher margins.
So are you open to focusing
on the higher margin,
as opposed to
pushing the price down?
Because instead of spending
the money on the new molds,
you could probably push
that into advertising.
?I hear that. Yeah.
?Okay.
I'll give you the 50K for 30%,
and I want to know now.
