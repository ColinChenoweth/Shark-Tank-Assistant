Herjavec: What's the guarantee?
Is there a guarantee to it?
Cuban: Yeah, the minimum he said
was $3 million in royalties.
?Right, so, it's minimums.
?Yeah, we have yearly minimums.
So, for the licensing
agreement,
if he does not perform
to those minimums,
we can walk away
from the licensing agreement.
But you did a lic??
So, you've already licensed it.
We have not.
We have a term sheet.
We're talking in it,
so we're kind of ??
?Talking.
?We're talking.
How much money
have you guys invested so far?
$30,000.
So, my uncle and I
went in together.
He ended up filing
the initial provisional patent.
He then signed the patent
over to me, and the company,
and now, out of our sales,
he gets a $1?per?step royalty
I give to him.
Oh, so, your uncle gets $1
for each piece sold.
?Yep. Yeah.
?Yes.
?Is that in perpetuity?
?Forever? Forever?
It's for 18 more years.
?18 more years?
?18 years?
Greiner: Wow.
Well, it's attached
to the patent.
You have an uncle like Kevin?
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
and they've discovered
You're guaranteed money.
If they fall
a little bit short,
you can take the product back
and go to market with it.
Yep.
I mean, why wouldn't you
do that deal?
So, here's why we're here.
In the world, there's about
a billion registered vehicles.
Only a quarter of those
are in the United States.
We want to look
at the big picture
outside the United States
and North America.
So you want to take this deal
and work with us to go global.
?Yes.
?Right.
Well, I'm interested in it.
I have connections
with Cox Automotive.
I'll give you
$450,000 for 20%.
Herjavec: $450,000, 20%.
$2.2 million value.
You're asking
for a $3 million value.
?Mm?hmm.
?Right.
Okay.
What do you guys think?
I'd say we're not willing
to go to 20%.
20% is a lot of equity
to give up for ??
John: It's a lot of money.
I understand that, but for ??
for that amount of equity,
I think we'd be better off
just selling it outright.
If ?? If the offer was right,
I?I'd sell it.
So, what would you sell
the whole company for outright?
Well, came in here
with a 3 million dol??
$3 million valuation,
so that's ??
I mean, I'd try
to stick around that.
Greiner: $3 million.
I can buy the whole thing
for $3 million?
We'd be willing to, I mean,
definitely come down to the
$3 million or go around there...
It's a re?? We get it.
It's a newer company.
...because we want to be ??
I mean, we enjoy our jobs.
Baby number ??
Baby number two
is on the way.
Yeah. That, too.
?Oh, congratulations!
?Ah!
A few million dollars
in the bank goes a long way.
[ Laughter ]
John: If you have
that contract in place,
I will offer you right now
$3 million
for the entire company.
Wow.
With that licensing
agreement in place?
Yeah.
And you'll handle
the $1 royalty to our uncle?
Yes.
You got to pay
Uncle Moki forever.
Greiner: Wow.
We'll deal with Uncle Moki
on how long because ??
?Let's do it.
?We're doing it.
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh, my gosh!
[ Laughter ]
?All right.
?Wow!
?Congratulations.
?Thank you.
?Try it out, Daymond.
?You got to try it now!
My patent was granted
five days ago.
What?!
So, pretty good timing,
I'd say.
?Nice.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Congratulations.
The patent was actually
done completely pro bono.
So, I reached out
to a patent firm,
one of the premier
patent firms in Michigan,
and I said,
"Hey, I'm a 16?year?old kid.
I invented this product.
Any chance you could
help me out?"
And they were
nice enough to say,
"You know what? Sure, kid, like,
we'll write a patent for you."
Oh, good for you.
Good for you.
Amazing.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tammy Rant,
and I'm from the suburbs
of Northern California.
And I'm here today
seeking $200,000
for 10% of my company, TushBaby.
?[ Laughs ]
?Tammy, how much is it?
$21.81 is the landed price,
and I'm retailing for $79
with free shipping
in the United States.
?$21.81.
?Are you all direct?to?consumer?
Right now, yes.
?On your website?
?Yes.
How many have you sold?
So, we've sold about 2,500.
We just launched five weeks ago.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?2,500 units?
?Yes.
?Wow.
?Holy crap.
?So...
?Congrats.
?Nice!
?Really nice.
Was there any P. R.?type push
to push that?
?It went viral.
?How did it go viral?
So, a ?? a couple big
media outlets posted it ??
With parents, right,
particularly dads like me,
when my kids were really tiny,
everything was an adventure.
Right.
And you could see
with Robert holding Ben,
right, his ?? his tush
was halfway off.
Right.
What ?? What are the complaints
that you're getting online,
or what are the risk factors
that you're concerned about?
TushBaby is a parent's helper.
It's not a replacement
for active parenting.
Hmm.
So, it's like
other products on the market,
like specific types of chairs...
?But ?? But don't you think ??
I mean, have you had instances
where you can swing and miss?
We're worried about
dropping babies.
We're just ?? Yeah, 'cause
Ben was sliding out,
so I'm just curious
if that's been a concern
that you've heard
from customers.
Not from customers before, no.
?Okay, that's good.
?It's a concern I had.
We did do market research
and had test trials,
and then we refined the product
based on the feedback.
Have you shipped yet, though?
?No. So, I ??
?Ohh.
How many people have these?
Um, about 25.
So, the comments ?? are any of
the comments coming from the 25
that are actually
using this first product?
Oh, yeah, I mean, I did ext??
I've been
developing it for a year
and enhancing the product.
We've had 12 different
prototypes.
How much money
have you raised?
I raised $75,000 for 5%
very early on
before I even launched or even
had my final prototype done.
Good for you.
Friends and family or...
Yeah, it was
a good family friend.
The reason I need the money
is to place a really large order
so I can get ahead
of my pre?order situation,
and the way that
it's going right now,
I'm selling over 500 a week.
And I'm gonna be sold out
of my pre?orders
that I already have ordered
before they even get here.
?What's your background?
?Yeah.
So, I'm an enterprise
sales rep for LinkedIn.
Are you still doing that
for LinkedIn, or are you ??
?So, for a couple more months.
?You have three kids. [ Laughs ]
A couple more months,
I'm gonna be at LinkedIn still,
and then after that, um, 100% ??
?Running this.
I wake up every morning
at 5:00 a. m., work on TushBaby,
go to LinkedIn, come home,
take my kids for a couple hours,
put them to bed,
work 'til midnight,
and then I do plan on expanding
for October when the baby's due.
I'm gonna have
an assistant start.
I'm really impressed
with what you did.
Thank you.
And I'm impressed
with you. I mean...
[ Greiner laughs ]
?Thank you.
?...two babies, one on the way,
still working at a company,
a wife,
running another company,
starting it.
I mean, I think you work
harder than me, so...
Thank you.
?That's not saying much.
?That's true.
?Yeah, that's not hard.
?[ Laughs ]
?Yeah.
?So, Tammy ??
You know, I've put my life
into this. I ??
That's true, but I?I have
an offer for you, Tammy, so ??
Oh! There's an offer.
?I have an offer for you, Tammy.
?Oh.
$200,000 for 10%.
You want to take the offer?
Well, wait a second.
You may have other offers.
I ??
?You may lose this one.
?Yeah. That's okay.
Tammy,
let me clear things up.
You're incredibly impressive.
I think it's a great product.
My concern is,
it's a singular product,
as opposed to an entire
product line.
And you haven't
actually delivered any.
Right.
So ?? So, to me,
it just seems risky.
I'm not saying
you can't do it.
Just not something
for me today.
I'm out.
Well, thank you
for your consideration.
I have an offer for you.
I'll offer you
the $200,000 for 15%
because I bring a lot more value
than Daymond does.
[ Laughter ]
So ??
Kevin, what's the value
you bring?
A lot. I would ??
I would ??
See, I still have a baby
with a diaper. You'll have
a <i>partner</i> with a diaper.
You know,
I?I recently brought
another baby product
into my portfolio,
so I'm now just working on
a whole lot of social for it.
But anybody that's
holding a child this way
would use this product,
so I'm starting to see a lot
of synergies between those two.
You'll start to notice now
when you're out more often
that there's parents
carrying their babies
like this all the time.
There's no solution
for quick carrying.
So, Tammy, you ?? Tammy ??
Cuban: No, this
would have been great.
When my kids were young,
this would have been amazing.
Tammy, you have two offers.
I'm offering you exactly
what you asked for, right?
Thank you, and I ??
I would love to ask you
if I could listen
to all the other offers
because I think you want a
partner that is not impulsive,
makes thorough ??
I want a partner who's decisive,
and I asked ??
I offered you
exactly what you asked for.
And, Tammy, I'll ??
I'll simplify it. Look.
There's three industries
that I avoid like the plague ??
the music industry,
pet industry...
It sounds like
he's about to drop out.
...and the kids industry.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, you have two offers.
Lori, what are you doing?
Lori, I would love
to hear your thoughts.
Greiner: Um, well,
let me tell you.
I think your product's
really clever.
My only concern is,
we don't know yet
what the consumer's gonna say
or feel when they get it home.
And so for those reasons,
it's just too early for me
as an investor.
Oh, Lori. I?I hope
that you know ??
So, I've had it t??
a lot of people wear it.
Everybody loves it,
and it exists ??
But you only have
25 people testing it.
The final prototype.
I've had hundreds test
all the way along the way.
Tammy, Sharks want to feel
like we're adding value
and we're being valued.
I already told you that you
were risking us dropping out.
I'm gonna adjust my offer
to $200,000 for 15%.
I'm gonna match
Kevin's offer.
Lori, did you drop out?
I didn't hear you drop out.
?No, she hasn't.
Are you ?? Are you
definitely out, Lori?
Have you said you're in or out?
What are you doing?
Well, I?I was saying
that my concern
is what the consumer's going
to say once they get it home.
I'd be willing to get a rush
order up, you know, fly it in...
I'm almost begging her
not to screw up these
offers right here.
...and test it so that ??
on a bigger scale.
Have you even thought about
having a seat belt...
Tammy, do you want
an offer or not?
?...or a security belt?
?I do.
Because I'm ?? I'm tired of...
Tammy, Tammy, I believe
you're here for ??
Cuban:
Sometimes great salespeople
have to learn to stop selling.
All right.
I believe you're here for Lori,
so I'm gonna drop out.
Oh. Sorry, Daymond.
I?I would have loved
to partner with you...
I understand, but I can
see that you already had
in mind probably Lori.
...but I just really want
to explore all the options.
Wow!
So, real?? real??
really fast ??
I can't believe
you did that.
I?I don't want to lose his
offer, but I ?? I think ??
?But you did.
?You got to make your decision.
It can't ?? Real quick,
you can add straps to it.
It's something that
I've considered.
I really wanted to focus
on brand equity...
Tammy, I'm not
feeling the love.
...and getting a novel
product to the market,
and then I will be
adding straps down the line
and an extension belt
so it can fit other people.
?Tammy, I'm out.
?Please ?? Okay ?? No, no, no.
?I'm out.
?Please!
You pissed me off. I'm out.
Narrator: Four Sharks are out.
Tammy had two offers on
the table from Daymond and Kevin
for her baby carrier, TushBaby,
but her indecisiveness
has made her lose both.
?Tammy, I'm out.
?Please ?? Okay ?? No, no, no.
?I'm out.
?Please!
You pissed me off. I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
You don't sell someone else
when they're not there for you.
?I wanted you together.
And there's only one
Mr. Wonderful.
Now, you better
talk her into the deal...
Wow.
...or you walk out of here
with nothing.
I'm done with you.
I'm sorry.
Give your best shot
to Lori now.
You better
give her a deal, Lori,
'cause I'm out, he's out.
?Would you do $200,000 for 15%?
This is gonna be the number?one
item on baby registries.
You're the perfect
partner for me.
I would love to have worked
with both of you.
My concern is,
is the risk of putting...
Are you in or out, Lori?
We've heard this already.
...the money in.
Be considerate to her.
Stop interrupting, Kev.
Come on.
?This is her big moment.
?Yeah.
She's standing on this carpet,
and it means...
I think she just
blew her big moment.
?...everything to her.
?No, she didn't.
She came here for Lori,
and she has a shot. Go ahead.
We are gonna make
a lot together on this.
This is ?? I promise you.
People love it.
They do. They love it.
It's ?? It's ??
I've gotten reached out to
by orthopedists, pediatricians.
And the users ?? they love it.
It's ?? It's something
that ?? It's a ??
There's a real need
for it on the market,
and I know we can
blow it out together.
You are the quality of a partner
that I really like,
the product is really smart,
but because of the risk,
I would be most comfortable
doing $200,000 at 20%.
?Congratulations, Tammy.
?Bye.
?Thank you so much, everybody.
?Congratulations.
?Congrats.
?Thank you.
Rant: I came here for Lori.
I risked everything for Lori.
I'm so happy
to have her on board.
She is the Shark
that I wanted all along,
and I was willing to
give up other offers
with better valuations
to have Lori on my team,
and I'm so excited
to partner with her.
When I see somebody
that's indecisive,
I don't want to work with them.
?She wasn't indecisive.
?I think she was decisive.
She came in here
looking for Lori.
She came in here
looking for Lori.
No, no, she was scrambling.
You know what they teach you
in enterprise sales?
When you have the order,
you know what you do?
Stop talking.
?You take it. You stop talking.
