Hello, Sharks.
My name is John Sorial.
I'm from Washington, D. C.
?Want to eat?
?Feed us, John! Feed us!
So, it's a falafel ball?
Well, there's two lines
of products.
Are they all the same?
?No.
?Thank you.
John, this feels very fresh,
like it was made a minute ago.
Thank you so much.
Is it made a minute ago,
or is it from the package
at Johns Hopkins University.
I graduated.
I worked in oil refining.
I traveled
all over the world.
But I found it to be
a really hollow experience.
You know, it just wasn't
a passion of mine.
Hey, John, it says here you give
25% of your profits to charity.
25% of distributed profits
from the original founders
is going
to not?for?profits.
So, does that mean ??
A specific one, or...?
Well, yes, we have a few,
but the biggest one
works with
impoverished children.
They try to break
the poverty cycle
Oh, John. John.
of John's
frozen falafel company, TaDah!
You're giving up
25% of the equity
to the social causes,
not of the profits?
Correct.
Oh, John. John.
Whoa.
Maybe I'm not doing a good job
of explaining this.
The investors ??
the four investors ??
John, look, here you are facing
an inventory shortage.
Why didn't your investors
loan you more?
Our total liability's
$445,000.
That's why they're not
loaning you more money.
John, sometimes
you love the singer...
Yeah.
...but you hate the song.
Well, I'll sing you
a different song.
[ Laughter ]
No, listen, seriously.
I wish you luck,
but this isn't for me.
I'm out.
O'Leary: John, look,
the food's great.
As we peel the onion
on your story, oh, my goodness!
Ugh!
The cap table, it doesn't need
<i>cosmetic</i> surgery.
It needs <i>major</i> surgery.
No, it doesn't.
He re?explained it.
It was okay.
What do you mean?
It's four investors.
It's misalignment.
No, no, no, he just ??
Let me finish, Mark.
I mean,
it's too much work for me.
I'm sorry, my friend.
Food's great.
I really don't see it
as that much ??
I'm out. I'm out.
It's just ??
It's too much work.
Daniel, I'm betting,
in the journey of Kind,
you faced this problem
somewhere along the road.
What does this guy
have to do?
Lubetzky: Um...
Kind,
when it was born...
Yeah?
...we were in a situation
not very dissimilar to yours.
Right.
I'd lost
about $1 million in sales
because one of our manufacturers
had changed the ingredients.
Greiner: John. John.
With fair terms.
You've been
through the wars,
What about this, John?
John, John.
John. John, this is
a tremendous opportunity.
I'll give you $300,000
for 20% ?? less than his ??
but I'll give you
another $500,000 line of credit.
So now there's two offers.
You both are icons
in your respective industries.
Is there any way to structure
a deal with both of you?
Lubetzky:
I just want to make clear
Herjavec: John,
you got to make a decision.
You have to decide.
What are you gonna do?
Would you do half a million
for 20%?
No.
