Hi. I'm Sarah.
And I am Syed.
And we're here
seeking $270,000
for 2% of our company,
Blueland.
Wow!
Sharks, this is what
an average household
uses in one year
in cleaning products.
So, Sarah,
what do I pay for it?
Our starter sets,
which include one bottle
and one tablet,
that costs $12.
And our Essentials kit,
which includes one hand soap
and three cleaning sprays,
that retails for $39.
And what's a refill cost?
One tablet costs just $2,
which is unequivocally cheaper
than going out
and buying a full,
new plastic bottle of cleaner.
And what's your background?
Are you a chemist?
I went to Harvard
for undergrad.
?'Course you did.
?I majored in economics.
After that,
I worked in private equity.
And then I returned to Harvard
for business school,
but I actually ended up
dropping out
in my first year
to pursue my first startup.
So, you're a total slacker.
[ Chuckles ]
My first startup
was a mobile shopping app,
and I ended up selling that
to one of the world's
largest shopping search engines
at the time.
?Wow.
?And, Syed, what about you?
I actually was born
in Pakistan.
I moved here
when I was 10 years old.
I grew up here.
My parents
both passed away.
Sorry.
That was
a difficult thing.
I'm the youngest of nine.
I have seven sisters.
I graduated
from University of Pittsburgh
with my chemistry degree.
Most recently, I was
a Director of Foreign Relations
at one of the world's largest
nontoxic cleaning companies.
We are all aware of the problem
with plastics.
We're trying to do
everything we can
to not destroy our planet
before it's too late.
What's your unique selling
proposition or differentiation?
So, we have really formulated
these products
to be really,
really effective.
And, again,
I come from huge companies.
We know ?? I know how
to formulate these products
better than, like, the normal,
traditional chemist.
Come on, Syed.
Look ??
So, the premise is,
you have the <i>one</i> guy
in all the world
in chemistry...
?[ Chuckling ] Yeah, right.
?...that made a better product.
Lubetzky:
In the phase of entrepreneurs,
there's three important phases.
One is the creative process,
which you clearly have done.
The second one
is the critic,
and the third
is a crusader.
The three C's.
That's great.
The creative, you've done.
The critic ?? You need to be
your own worst critic.
You need to
figure out what is it
that is your competitor
to understand,
whether you really can
differentiate yourself
from the others.
And then, if you go through
that second phase,
then you go to the third phase,
and then you're the crusader,
and nobody's gonna stop you.
?Yes.
But I feel like you skipped
the second phase.
Please explain to me
what differentiates you,
other than you being
a really great chemist.
Paiji Yoo: We have EPA?approved
third?party studies that show
that our products
were more effective ??
Laboratory studies?
Laboratory studies.
Yeah, third party.
We outperformed all
of our leading competitors.
Guys, how much money
have you raised?
So, we've raised
$3 million.
?What?!
?At what valuation?
At a $13.5 million
valuation.
And who did you
raise it from?
A mix of venture capital
as well as
successful entrepreneurs
just like yourselves.
And you've been selling
for how long?
So, we've been live
for just over a month.
We've done $200,000
in sales.
Okay, that's not horrible.
So, today, we are 100%
direct?to?consumer
selling online.
However, we are launching
in a big?box national retailer
at the beginning
of next year.
I don't think I like
that you have just
one tablet, one bottle.
I think when you see tablets,
you buy a bag
of dishwashing pellets,
and you get a whole bag of them,
like 36 in a bag.
So I feel like this needs
a strip with it
of a whole bunch of tablets.
It's much more appealing to a
customer that's looking at it.
Sarah and Syed came in
seeking $270,000 for 2%
of their eco?friendly cleaning?
product company, Blueland.
?Great job, Sarah!
?Good luck, guys.
?Congrats.
?Oh, my goodness.
?Love it.
?Ohh, my God!
The way we just started,
I thought there was no way
we'd walk away.
We got a Shark!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my goodness.
There's a woman
who understands me.
