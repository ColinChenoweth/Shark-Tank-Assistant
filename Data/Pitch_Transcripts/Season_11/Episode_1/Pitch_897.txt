Hello, Sharks.
My name is John Sorial.
I'm from Washington, D. C.
And I'm seeking
a $300,000 investment
in exchange for 10% equity
in my product.
Sharks, being the son
of Egyptian immigrants,
I loved the East Mediterranean
foods I grew up on.
The problem is, my grandmother
didn't ship nationwide.
So I took authentic recipes
from the motherland
and gave them
a fresh, new taste and look
with TaDah! Foods.
TaDah! is a frozen line
of products
that brings one of the world's
most popular dishes, falafel,
to the masses.
Falafel is
an amazingly savory blend
of chickpeas, aromatic herbs,
fresh veggies, and spices.
Mmm!
And we've made it super?easy
and convenient to enjoy
with our Falafel Street Wraps.
In just three minutes,
you can say goodbye
to bland, boring bean burritos
and finally eat something
that's bursting with flavors.
And that's not all.
For those looking
to eat gluten?free,
we created the world's first
and only stuffed falafel popper.
That's right.
I took
the already?perfect falafel
and I figured out how
to stuff it on the inside
with one of our creamy
signature dips.
So, Sharks,
who wants to help me
take America
on an exotic culinary journey
of deliciously prepared
plant?based foods
ready to heat and eat
any time of day?
?Bring it.
?Yeah.
?Want to eat?
?Feed us, John! Feed us!
So, it's a falafel ball?
Well, there's two lines
of products.
Are they all the same?
?No.
?Thank you.
John, this feels very fresh,
like it was made a minute ago.
Thank you so much.
Is it made a minute ago,
or is it from the package
and is it refrigerated,
frozen?
That has been sitting on the
shelf somewhere in a retail ??
I actually bought it off
the shelf and brought it here.
Really?
So I don't know
the manufacture date on it,
but, you know,
we get about an 18?month
shelf life on our product.
Well,
that's very reassuring.
In the refrigerated set
or in the frozen set?
In the frozen set.
This is a frozen product.
It's chickpea, right?
Chickpea?based, yes.
Tell us about
your background.
My parents are immigrants.
They actually left Egypt.
There was some religious
persecution that was happening.
They came to America.
And when you're the son
of immigrant parents,
they're really liberal
and open?minded,
as long as you take
a profession in medicine,
engineering, law,
or medicine, right?
[ Laughter ]
And so, I studied
chemical engineering
at Johns Hopkins University.
I graduated.
I worked in oil refining.
I traveled
all over the world.
But I found it to be
a really hollow experience.
You know, it just wasn't
a passion of mine.
What do you sell it for,
and what is the cost?
The 7 1/2?ounce
Falafel Street Wraps
retail for $3.99,
and the 8?ounce bag of
the gluten?free Falafel Poppers
retails for $4.99.
Costs me $1.09.
Hey, John, it says here you give
25% of your profits to charity.
25% of distributed profits
from the original founders
is going
to not?for?profits.
So, does that mean ??
A specific one, or...?
Well, yes, we have a few,
but the biggest one
works with
impoverished children.
They try to break
the poverty cycle
through education, medical care,
and food programs.
O'Leary: Break down
the numbers for me.
Lifetime sales
is over $8.2 million.
Wow!
Trailing 12 months
is $1 million.
And the year before that?
$1 million.
You've stayed steady
at $1 million.
So you're flat.
Yeah, we're flat
because demand is there
and we just ??
we can't supply it.
We were the fastest?growing
frozen brand in the country.
And then...
And then we ran into
a big production issue.
Aha.
And so then we went
from 2.3 to 1.7,
and now we're at 1.
What happened?
You were using
a co?packer?
Yeah, so,
it was fantastic.
We were achieving
great margins with them.
They became
financially insolvent.
?You couldn't make product.
?I couldn't make product.
I would show up, and they'd have
four people on the floor.
This takes dozens of people,
right?
Wow.
So, I would stay all night
with the staff.
I would suit up, and I was
shoveling chickpeas myself.
But at the same time, I was
flying all over the country
trying to source
new co?packers.
We fixed that problem.
On this million of sales
in the last 12 months...
?Yeah.
?...how much did you lose?
Say, 2018,
we lost $200,000.
The more you're talking,
I'm less excited.
When you first came out, I was
like, "Whoo! Falafel!"
?Let's get you more excited.
?Alright.
We are in the top 10 of
all frozen products nationwide,
and we were the fastest?growing
in the frozen natural space.
Not anymore.
You're flat.
You know, hearing your story
resonates to me,
but I think there are some
other Sharks on the panel here
that can help
accelerate you faster.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
So, how much
have you invested,
and have you taken in
any outside investors?
So, we've only ever done
a friends and family round.
The total round was $300,000.
How much equity did you have to
give up for the $300,000?
I gave away 75%.
?You own 25%?
?Yes.
You gave up 75?
Sorry ?? you gave up 75%
at the beginning?
Okay, so, that's a lot,
and that has a lot of
implications, right?
Sure. Originally, it was 50%,
right, to the investors.
And I had the other 50%.
So, then,
what we ended up doing was,
the other investors
were like,
"No, we want to be
part of the giving," okay?
So we then distributed that 25%
that was reserved
for the social causes, and we
distributed amongst all of us.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That doesn't make sense.
Sorry. Hang on.
You're giving up
25% of the equity
to the social causes,
not of the profits?
Correct.
Oh, John. John.
of John's
frozen falafel company, TaDah!
You're giving up
25% of the equity
to the social causes,
not of the profits?
Correct.
Oh, John. John.
Whoa.
Maybe I'm not doing a good job
of explaining this.
The investors ??
the four investors ??
myself and the other three
investors ?? or founders ??
own 100% of the company.
Okay. Alright.
And in each
of our own equity stake,
we've pledged
25% of what we make
to these charities.
John, look, here you are facing
an inventory shortage.
Why didn't your investors
loan you more?
Our total liability's
$445,000.
That's why they're not
loaning you more money.
John, sometimes
you love the singer...
Yeah.
...but you hate the song.
Well, I'll sing you
a different song.
[ Laughter ]
No, listen, seriously.
I wish you luck,
but this isn't for me.
I'm out.
O'Leary: John, look,
the food's great.
As we peel the onion
on your story, oh, my goodness!
Ugh!
The cap table, it doesn't need
<i>cosmetic</i> surgery.
It needs <i>major</i> surgery.
No, it doesn't.
He re?explained it.
It was okay.
What do you mean?
It's four investors.
It's misalignment.
No, no, no, he just ??
Let me finish, Mark.
I mean,
it's too much work for me.
I'm sorry, my friend.
Food's great.
I really don't see it
as that much ??
I'm out. I'm out.
It's just ??
It's too much work.
Daniel, I'm betting,
in the journey of Kind,
you faced this problem
somewhere along the road.
What does this guy
have to do?
Lubetzky: Um...
Kind,
when it was born...
Yeah?
...we were in a situation
not very dissimilar to yours.
Right.
I'd lost
about $1 million in sales
because one of our manufacturers
had changed the ingredients.
And we were this far away
from just closing everything.
Yeah.
And it's fascinating to me
when I think back
that Kind grew out of the one of
the toughest years of my life,
and out of that darkness
came incredible light,
and Kind today sells
in 300,000 stores,
over $1 billion a year
in retail.
And so it can happen.
And when I think about you and
I see how you haven't given up
after every single thing
that has hit you...
Correct.
...I just want to understand
what's motivating you.
Why haven't you just gone back
to being an engineer?
What does this mean
to you?
It's perspective, right?
When you go to other parts
of the world
and you see
how people live, right,
you realize
that there are ??
People are fighting
for their lives.
That's why I'm not ?? Like, I
want to be a profitable company,
and I've worked really hard,
and we ??
[ Sighs ]
[ Voice breaking ]
And it has been difficult.
But I think about my family
and those people
who are struggling.
And I want ??
I want this to be a success
because...
it'll impact their lives.
I'm sorry.
[ Sniffles ]
I've never cried like that.
I'm sorry.
[ Sniffles, groans ]
[ Sniffles ]
And I understand
you think it's complex
because we've been
through a lot,
but it just means that I know
how to keep our company going.
You have someone who has proven
themself, who's scaled it,
has the team,
has the manufacturing.
We just want to succeed.
Your story resonates a lot
with me, as I said earlier,
and you have an
incredibly quality product...
Thank you.
...and you have
an incredible passion,
but you have a mess
in terms of the system
that you have
that needs to be fixed.
So I don't see how with
$300,000, you get out of it.
You just need
a little bit more.
So if you want the $300,000,
I'll do it for 20%.
?Wow.
?Okay.
Or I'll give you
half a million dollars for 25%
so that we can
do this properly.
Okay.
?Wow.
?Wow.
And if we do any of the ??
the bigger option,
that money
would be to buy out
a portion
or all of your investors
because I'm gonna be doing
all of the work with you,
so I want <i>you</i> to derive
the benefits.
Okay.
I actually
would like to get you
to a bigger stake
than you currently have.
Can we do $500,000 at 25%
but with then a line of credit
for accounts receivable
for another half million?
I will do the $500,000
for 25%,
and I will most likely
give you a line of credit,
but it's not
part of this deal.
I'm gonna sit down with you
and your investors...
Sure.
...and review the $400,000?some
that they're owed,
the equity that they have,
and then, as part
of our next negotiation,
I will be happy to provide maybe
a $1 million line of credit,
whatever is necessary.
That's amazing.
But it will have
to be part of the ??
Before you jump,
two of the people ??
or <i>three</i> people,
potentially ??
that have been there with you
since the beginning,
he wants to try
to buy out.
Greiner: John. John.
With fair terms.
You've been
through the wars,
and when somebody is
in a foxhole with you...
Yes.
...you don't
buy them out, right?
That's exactly right.
But, from what I understand,
that's an option.
No, you said
your investors signaled
that they're willing
to do whatever it takes.
Right now, the investors
are dying to just
get their money back.
You don't know that, though.
You don't know that.
Well, it's pretty obvious
from the numbers.
What valuation are you buying
them out at, right?
Just going back and saying,
"Is there a price
to buy you out at?"
means, "I think
it's gonna go up in value,
and I'm not taking you
for the ride," right?
"I think I can create more value
than I'm gonna pay you."
Otherwise, you wouldn't
buy them out, right?
You don't always know that,
Mark.
Yeah, of course.
Maybe they just want
to get some cash out.
To Mark's point, my partners ??
they're my friends.
They believed in me
when it was just a concept.
So, as long as this is not,
like, some type of takeover...
What about this, John?
John, John.
John. John, this is
a tremendous opportunity.
I'll give you $300,000
for 20% ?? less than his ??
but I'll give you
another $500,000 line of credit.
So now there's two offers.
You both are icons
in your respective industries.
Is there any way to structure
a deal with both of you?
Lubetzky:
I just want to make clear
that I'm doing this
to give you a hand.
I know you are.
I don't do charity.
I want you to win,
but the terms that I'm offering
are very generous.
Herjavec: John,
you got to make a decision.
You have to decide.
What are you gonna do?
Would you do half a million
for 20%?
No.
