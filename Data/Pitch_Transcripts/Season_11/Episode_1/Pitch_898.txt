And I'm Crom Carmichael,
also from Nashville, Tennessee.
The name of our company
is Minus Cal.
We're seeking $500,000
for 20% of the business.
Damn.
Now, 45 million Americans
go on a diet each year,
but the fact that 70% of adults
are either obese or overweight
means that something's
not working.
We need more lettuce
and fewer French fries.
That's easy to say,
harder to do,
and it's always
a lot less fun.
That's where Minus Cal
comes in,
a science?based snack bar
and diet tablet
that block fat
when you eat it.
And how does Minus Cal
block fat?
So, imagine your digestive tract
is a party,
and our ingredient, the Choleve,
is the bouncer.
Herjavec: [ Laughs ]
When the fat shows up
at the party
without an invitation...
[ Greiner laughs ]
Choleve...
Cuban: Ohh!
...escorts the fat
out of the party
and out of your system,
Actually, Crom,
now you're pissing <i>me</i> off.
[ Laughs ] You're digging
a deeper hole.
And I got to tell you, it's got
nothing to do with Mark.
You're kind of losing
credibility.
You just said
you're not ??
You said
you're not losing weight.
What does it say
right here?
I will stand behind the fact
that the goal is to help ??
Did you ?? No, but ??
Yeah. It's to help people
lose weight.
No, I am happy to say ??
O'Leary: Okay, guys,
I think we're done here.
To everybody who's watching,
don't buy it.
I'm out.
Okay.
?Thank you, gentlemen.
?Thank you.
?Go in peace.
?Thank you.
