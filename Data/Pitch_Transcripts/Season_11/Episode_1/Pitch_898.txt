[ Screaming ]
Lori, you have a deal!
Yeah!
Greiner:
From day 1, I knew I never
wanted to work for anyone else.
I wanted to be the ruler
of my own destiny
and take my life
into my own hands.
Yeah!
Herjavec: Freedom is the ability
to control your own life.
No one can fire you. No one's
gonna tell you what to do.
It's all up to you.
I'm gonna make you rich.
Watch it happen.
One great idea is power ??
the power to set you free.
[ Chanting "Shark Tank!" ]
Narrator: For over a decade,
"Shark Tank"
has been in the business
of inspiring entrepreneurs.
Scrub Daddy will be scrubbing
in every kitchen in the world.
Narrator:
It's launched household names
and hugely successful companies
totaling over $6 billion
in retail sales...
Welcome to Maine!
Welcome to Maine!
...and made life?changing dreams
come true.
It's a deal.
We're super?grateful to be able
to continue our dad's dream
and to share our story
with people all over the world.
And tonight...
Listening to Lori, I realize
that there's a piece of this
she understands
far better than I.
So I would propose,
without consulting with Lori,
that we invest
$1 million...
Whoa.
...for 25% of the company.
Herjavec: Whoa!
If you're willing ??
If Lori wants in on it,
I'm in on it,
and if not,
I'm in on it by myself.
Every single mistake
that you're about to make,
we've probably made before,
and we're gonna be able to help
you prevent those mistakes.
And I really, really resonate
with your immigrant story.
I came from Mexico.
My father and my mother
didn't have a higher education.
And I was able to,
from nothing,
build a pretty successful
company ?? Kind ??
that is now
in 300,000 distribution points,
in every retailer
you want to be.
I think everything you've done
is really brilliant.
I'm a huge fan
of Kind Bars,
and I like your theory
of the word "kind."
Why did you
even put it as "kind"?
Because you wanted
to spread kindness
to the world
and do good things.
You know why
I put it on "kind"?
Because my father was liberated
by American soldiers
from a concentration camp,
and in spite
of horrible situations,
he always remembered...
Wow.
...not just the horrors,
but the kindness
that people showed to him
and helped him survive.
So it's in honor of,
in the tough moments,
always being kind to others.
Wow, that's a great story,
Daniel.
It is. Very.
I think you need a me.
I'm not happy to give them
even more money.
Are you in the deal
or not?
I'm gonna change the deal,
if Daniel's interested.
Well, while you change the deal,
I'm gonna make you an offer
that's probably more close to
what you actually wanted to do,
'cause I don't think
you're gonna sell 25% of
your company here today.
Alright.
What I'd like to do
is do $270,000 for 5%,
and I want
1% advisory shares,
because, frankly,
I bring a lot to the table.
There's only one Mr. Wonderful.
While you're
mulling that over
and while these guys are trying
to take 25% of your business,
let me tell you
where I'm at.
The product is easy to use.
Changing consumers' minds ??
super?hard.
I'm out.
Sorry to hear that.
Alright,
we've changed our offer.
We're gonna do $270,000
for 8%.
O'Leary: Ouch.
4% and 4% ??
that's the offer.
What are you doing,
Mark?
Guys, look, I don't think
you really came here for a deal.
You came for the commercial.
I'm out.
But you still
have two offers.
My offer is $270,000 for 6%,
and the other
is $270,000 for 8%.
What do you want to do?
Lori and Daniel have
offered $270,000 for 8%,
and Kevin has offered
$270,000 for 6%.
What do you want to do?
We can't give away
that much.
You guys know
as much as we do...
Shocking!
...that it is critical
for us to have a lean,
high?growth business.
Do you have a counter
for any of us?
Do you have a counter
for any of us?
$270,000 at 3%.
Ooh! You guys
really didn't ??
Oh, my gosh!
I would love the opportunity
just to say one more thing.
In the theme
of compromise,
I'll go to 5%
for the $270,000.
keeping you from absorbing
those calories from fat.
It's that simple.
[ Laughs ]
And Choleve
is not a sketchy chemical.
Choleve is a proprietary,
all?natural blend
coming from fermented tea.
That's our trade secret.
And we're able to put Choleve
in a variety of delicious foods.
Minus Cal is a great way
to lose weight
and to achieve
better health.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to have your cake
and eat it, too,
with Minus Cal?
Do we get samples?
I'm gonna give them
to you right now.
?Lori.
?Thank you.
it takes about 100 calories
worth of fat with it."
Is there anybody that should
avoid this product,
or is it safe
for everybody?
It is safe for everyone.
It's safe for everybody.
It's all natural.
That doesn't necessarily make it
safe for everybody.
But at the same time,
look, guys,
you know I'm a skeptic
on all this stuff.
Yeah.
You can't claim that it's gonna
reduce 100 calories
out of what you eat
by taking two pills.
?We don't make that claim.
?That's what he said.
We are gonna make the claim
that it's gonna block fat
at a percentage
dependent on the individual.
Your t?shirts say
"Minus Cal."
That's 'cause that's the brand
name of the company.
When a consumer looks at it,
what do you think
he's gonna think?
Minus Cal.
Minus calories.
Right!
What is your strategy?
What is your distribution?
Minus cals!
Their strategy
is to make you think
that this is gonna
reduce your calories.
Mark,
let me ask my question.
[ Chuckles ]
How long has this product
been around?
We just launched.
I assume you have very little
sales. Is that right?
Correct.
That's correct.
Guys, I'm stunned
you guys are dealing
and asking these questions.
Do you sell it
to other people, too?
Do you guys realize
they just invented this product
out of nothing
and gave it a name?
Hold up. Hold up.
Here, if my understanding
is right...
I'm trying to understand
what I'm investing in, Mark.
...you have a bar that's
high?fiber?weight.
You're investing in air.
You have a bar that has
natural things in it.
You're saying ??
Mark, it's not ??
Mark, let me just say this.
Mark, Mark.
It's not air.
?Yes, it is.
?It's not air.
?So, you took green ??
?Mark, Mark, let me say this.
I have the data
to back it up.
So, listen, if you want
to get out, get out,
but you're wrong.
No, I'm not wrong.
So, listen.
No, you are wrong.
You took
green?tea extract, right,
and you invented
a product called Choleve.
No, it's not green?tea
extract.
That's what you said.
I said it's derived
from green tea.
We take a particular
molecule.
We increase that concentration
by 20 times.
Because that green?tea molecule
can lower your cholesterol
by 20%, right?
Yes.
Everybody knows that.
Everybody knows what?
So, listen, I find Mark's points
potentially persuasive,
but in my philosophy,
the way I like to eat
is ingredients you can see
and pronounce, real food,
and I feel nature,
over thousands of years,
has nurtured us in such ways
that we can just eat
the real stuff.
Best of luck to you,
but I'm out.
Here's where I'm at ??
$500,000 for 20% of a startup
that has no revenue
is way too high.
You asked for too much.
You made a strategic error.
I'm out.
I don't know about Choleve,
and I know that it's dangerous
to claim that certain products
will do miraculous things,
like not have fat
stay in your body...
Okay, not ??
...or whatever.
So I don't like to associate
with those things.
I have no problem with you,
but I'm out.
Look, I ??
I'm so frustrated.
I have no idea. I really don't
know what your business is.
I don't know
what your strategy is.
I really
don't know anything.
Mark, sometimes your level of
arrogance really pisses me off.
Yeah, I ??
And I ?? Mark, let me ??
And I'll only say that
you don't give people a chance.
I wish I knew
what their business was,
if you would let
people talk.
You know
what their product is, Robert.
Your level of arrogance
sometimes
just surrounds the room,
and you're a great guy ??
I'll be respectful to you,
Robert.
I won't say
what I'm thinking.
It intimidates people.
And I'm just telling you,
you might be 100% right.
I just wish I had
the opportunity to hear it.
I know how hard people work
to get on that floor.
You know what's even harder,
Robert?
And you don't give them
a chance.
?You know what's even harder?
?I'm out.
It says fewer calories,
Mark.
Right.
How do you lose weight?
May I please finish?
We're not claiming that you're
going to lose weight.
We're saying that we are gonna
take some fat out of your body.
Now, I don't care
what you say.
I know what my science says,
and you're wrong.
You're just plain wrong.
That particular molecule,
that extract also will help you
on your weight.
It won't make you lose ??
What did you just say?!
Let's ?? Let's ??
It won't make you lose weight.
It will <i>help</i> you.
It will <i>help</i> you lose
weight, but it won't
<i>make</i> you lose weight.
Aloha, Sharks!
I'm Cassidy Crowley.
And I'm Lori Crowley,
Cassidy's mom.
And we're from Honolulu,
Hawaii.
I'm seeking $50,000 in exchange
for 50% of my company.
Greiner: Wow.
Sharks, I love to create
and invent.
When I was 7 years old,
my baby sister, Emily,
would always play
with her spoon.
Aww!
And my mom would always
get worried
that she might accidentally
poke or stab her throat.
So I wanted to create a product
that eliminated
that long and sharp design
of a traditional spoon.
So I invented
the Baby Toon.
The Baby Toon
is a combination
of a baby spoon
and a teether all in one.
The rectangular body
makes it easy for babies
to grasp and self?feed.
The Baby Toon is made
of 100% soft silicone.
There are no sharp edges,
so it's gentle on babies' gums,
and it works great
for teething.
Sharks, all parents know
that babies love
throwing their spoons
on the floor.
Well, we have a solution
for this.
Just put a pacifier clip
around the Baby Toon...
?Ohh!
?Cool!
...and attach it
to the baby's shirt.
No more baby spoons getting
thrown on the floor!
But wait! There's more!
[ Laughter ]
Baby Toon is made
right here in the USA,
and it was designed
and created by me.
So, Sharks, who's ready to take
a bite out of the Baby Toon?
Both: Together,
we can bring Baby Toons
to every baby in the world.
?Nice!
?Wow!
?Good job, Cassidy!
?That was great!
Greiner: Oh, my gosh.
So, we have some samples we'd
like to pass out to you, Sharks.
How old was Cassidy?
I'm 10.
She's 10.
Herjavec: 10 going on 34.
Oh, are we gonna eat?
[ Laughs ]
This is for Lori.
?That's for me?
?Yep.
Okay.
?Should I feed Lori?
?[ Laughs ]
We've brought ??
from Hawaii, we have poi,
which is a Hawaiian
baby food.
Greiner: How did you come up
with the design?
And what did you do
to figure that out?
So, in first grade,
I entered a local science fair
when I was 7 years old.
And we have, actually,
my sample,
if you guys want
to see it.
We do.
Oh, wow.
So, that's your prototype?
Yeah, this is the one
that I made in first grade.
Look at this.
I mean, partially why
I'm just very thankful I'm here
is I want to show other kids
that they can be open
to opportunities
they have at school
or even at home
to create and invent.
I just really hope
I inspire them.
It's a dream come true.
So, are you selling it already,
or is it ??
Yeah,
we sell our product.
So, since September of 2018,
we had $5,000 in sales.
?Wow!
?Thank you.
What does it cost?
Our total cost is $6.60.
And you sell it
for how much?
We sell it for $15.
?$15?
?Good for you!
Cassidy, are you gonna be
a superstar at your school
because you were on
"Shark Tank"?
Well, that's obviously
not why I'm here.
[ Laughter ]
Ah, even better answer!
Oh, my God,
I love you!
Cassidy, it's pretty rare
that somebody comes in here
and offers us 50%.
Why did you do that?
I mean, let's face it.
I'm only 10 years old.
I need a partner.
I mean, I still have to go
to high school.
I think you're more of a Shark
than <i>we</i> are.
Cassidy, you've done
an amazing, amazing job.
I mean, it's incredible...
Thank you.
...to have started a business,
to develop a product,
to see it through,
to make your way here.
I mean, just ?? I can't even
imagine what's next for you.
The challenge I have is just,
it's really not a fit for me.
So I'm out,
but great, great job, Cassidy.
Cassidy, I've been doing little
businesses since I was a kid.
I can already tell
from your presence,
from your poise,
from your grit
that you're gonna go
very, very far.
This was three years ago,
and you didn't give up.
You know, manufacturing
can be very tricky.
I find it fascinating
that you pulled this off.
Well, actually, just recently,
we had to change our durometer
of silicone we're using,
so we had to lower it.
You had to change what?
Change the durometer
of silicone.
What's a durometer?
Durometer is how you measure
the firmness of silicone.
For example,
if you have something
that's a higher
durometer ??
Who are you, lady?
[ Laughing ] Exactly!
If you have something
that's a higher durometer
of silicone, it's gonna be
more stiff and hard.
And if you have something
that's a lower durometer
of silicone,
it's gonna be more flexible.
Cassidy,
do you have a patent on it?
Yeah, we have our patents
right here, actually.
Wow!
Cassidy,
I am beyond impressed.
I know you're not allowed
to do this
in the United States of America,
but if in 20 years,
you want to marry one
of my kids...
?[ Laughs ]
?...I'd be very delighted.
But in all seriousness,
you're so impressive.
But I don't understand
the baby space,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you so much.
Cassidy, I'm torn
because I don't feel
that you're willing
to quit elementary school.
But I can go straight
to college.
[ Laughter ]
Honestly, I don't want you to
quit school.
It's a little early.
I'm out.
Cassidy,
this is a great product.
You just absolutely
blow me away.
You said you always wanted
to go on "Shark Tank,"
and I'm so proud
if we had any part
in your wanting
to become an entrepreneur.
So, guess what, young lady.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
?Yay!
Because I have to be along
with this journey.
I'm giving you $50,000
for 50%.
Herjavec: Wow.
Lori...
you have a deal.
?Congratulations.
?Yay!
?Lori.
?Thank you.
So, what you guys have there,
from left to right ??
you have two versions
of our best?selling
Falafel Street Wrap.
The first one ??
that's our Sweet?n?Spicy
Harissa with Lebni.
Wow.
This is really good.
That second one is
the Lemon Roasted Garlic Hummus.
?Oh.
?Very nice.
And then
you have the Poppers.
It's Harissa Hummus,
Cucumber Dill Yogurt,
and our original
Hummus flavor.
