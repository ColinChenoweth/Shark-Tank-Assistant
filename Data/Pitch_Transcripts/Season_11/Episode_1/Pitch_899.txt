Aloha, Sharks!
I'm Cassidy Crowley.
And I'm Lori Crowley,
Cassidy's mom.
And we're from Honolulu,
Hawaii.
I'm seeking $50,000 in exchange
for 50% of my company.
Greiner: Wow.
Sharks, I love to create
and invent.
When I was 7 years old,
my baby sister, Emily,
would always play
with her spoon.
Aww!
And my mom would always
get worried
that she might accidentally
poke or stab her throat.
So I wanted to create a product
that eliminated
that long and sharp design
of a traditional spoon.
So I invented
the Baby Toon.
The Baby Toon
is a combination
of a baby spoon
and a teether all in one.
The rectangular body
makes it easy for babies
to grasp and self?feed.
The Baby Toon is made
of 100% soft silicone.
There are no sharp edges,
so it's gentle on babies' gums,
and it works great
for teething.
Sharks, all parents know
that babies love
throwing their spoons
on the floor.
Well, we have a solution
for this.
Just put a pacifier clip
around the Baby Toon...
?Ohh!
?Cool!
...and attach it
to the baby's shirt.
No more baby spoons getting
thrown on the floor!
But wait! There's more!
[ Laughter ]
Baby Toon is made
right here in the USA,
and it was designed
and created by me.
So, Sharks, who's ready to take
a bite out of the Baby Toon?
Both: Together,
we can bring Baby Toons
to every baby in the world.
?Nice!
?Wow!
?Good job, Cassidy!
?That was great!
Greiner: Oh, my gosh.
So, we have some samples we'd
like to pass out to you, Sharks.
How old was Cassidy?
I'm 10.
She's 10.
Herjavec: 10 going on 34.
Oh, are we gonna eat?
[ Laughs ]
This is for Lori.
?That's for me?
?Yep.
Okay.
?Should I feed Lori?
?[ Laughs ]
We've brought ??
from Hawaii, we have poi,
which is a Hawaiian
baby food.
Greiner: How did you come up
with the design?
And what did you do
to figure that out?
So, in first grade,
I entered a local science fair
when I was 7 years old.
And we have, actually,
my sample,
if you guys want
to see it.
We do.
Oh, wow.
So, that's your prototype?
Yeah, this is the one
that I made in first grade.
Look at this.
I mean, partially why
I'm just very thankful I'm here
is I want to show other kids
that they can be open
to opportunities
they have at school
or even at home
to create and invent.
I just really hope
I inspire them.
It's a dream come true.
So, are you selling it already,
or is it ??
Yeah,
we sell our product.
So, since September of 2018,
we had $5,000 in sales.
?Wow!
?Thank you.
What does it cost?
Our total cost is $6.60.
And you sell it
for how much?
We sell it for $15.
?$15?
?Good for you!
Cassidy, are you gonna be
a superstar at your school
because you were on
"Shark Tank"?
Well, that's obviously
not why I'm here.
[ Laughter ]
Ah, even better answer!
Oh, my God,
I love you!
Cassidy, it's pretty rare
that somebody comes in here
and offers us 50%.
Why did you do that?
I mean, let's face it.
I'm only 10 years old.
I need a partner.
I mean, I still have to go
to high school.
I think you're more of a Shark
than <i>we</i> are.
Cassidy, you've done
an amazing, amazing job.
I mean, it's incredible...
Thank you.
...to have started a business,
to develop a product,
to see it through,
to make your way here.
I mean, just ?? I can't even
imagine what's next for you.
The challenge I have is just,
it's really not a fit for me.
So I'm out,
but great, great job, Cassidy.
Cassidy, I've been doing little
businesses since I was a kid.
I can already tell
from your presence,
from your poise,
from your grit
that you're gonna go
very, very far.
This was three years ago,
and you didn't give up.
You know, manufacturing
can be very tricky.
I find it fascinating
that you pulled this off.
Well, actually, just recently,
we had to change our durometer
of silicone we're using,
so we had to lower it.
You had to change what?
Change the durometer
of silicone.
What's a durometer?
Durometer is how you measure
the firmness of silicone.
For example,
if you have something
that's a higher
durometer ??
Who are you, lady?
[ Laughing ] Exactly!
If you have something
that's a higher durometer
of silicone, it's gonna be
more stiff and hard.
And if you have something
that's a lower durometer
of silicone,
it's gonna be more flexible.
Cassidy,
do you have a patent on it?
Yeah, we have our patents
right here, actually.
Wow!
Cassidy,
I am beyond impressed.
I know you're not allowed
to do this
in the United States of America,
but if in 20 years,
you want to marry one
of my kids...
?[ Laughs ]
?...I'd be very delighted.
But in all seriousness,
you're so impressive.
But I don't understand
the baby space,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you so much.
Cassidy, I'm torn
because I don't feel
that you're willing
to quit elementary school.
But I can go straight
to college.
[ Laughter ]
Honestly, I don't want you to
quit school.
It's a little early.
I'm out.
Cassidy,
this is a great product.
You just absolutely
blow me away.
You said you always wanted
to go on "Shark Tank,"
and I'm so proud
if we had any part
in your wanting
to become an entrepreneur.
So, guess what, young lady.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
?Yay!
Because I have to be along
with this journey.
I'm giving you $50,000
for 50%.
Herjavec: Wow.
Lori...
you have a deal.
?Congratulations.
?Yay!
?Lori.
?Thank you.
So, what you guys have there,
from left to right ??
you have two versions
of our best?selling
Falafel Street Wrap.
The first one ??
that's our Sweet?n?Spicy
Harissa with Lebni.
Wow.
This is really good.
That second one is
the Lemon Roasted Garlic Hummus.
?Oh.
?Very nice.
And then
you have the Poppers.
It's Harissa Hummus,
Cucumber Dill Yogurt,
and our original
Hummus flavor.
