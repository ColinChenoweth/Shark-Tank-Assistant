My name's Joe Altieri,
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
Joe, how did you come up
with the idea?
So, I, um ?? I'm a window guy.
For about 20 years,
I sold window screens.
So, window manufacturers
have two options ??
they can buy screens
or they can make them
themselves.
Okay, Joe, I totally agree
you're the window guy.
I'm sure everybody else up here
thinks the same thing.
But I'm an investor guy,
Joe, baby, sweetie, honey,
what happened?
Well, we're reinvesting.
Herjavec: What was
your gross margin?
$700,000 last year.
?Out of five ??
?Why isn't your ??
So, that's ??
What is that?
That's the problem.
About 15%?
Roughly, yes.
Why isn't
your margin higher?
You're a manufacturer.
Shouldn't your margin be
quite a bit higher?
Well, so, we have
four manufacturing plants,
but they're actually
licensed manufacturers for us.
We don't actually own
the plants.
Thank God.
Well,
you buy from them.
Wait, did I hear
you're a royalty business?
Very similar
to a royalty business.
Yippee?i?o?ki?yay.
Yes, I'm speaking
your language here.
Break down the numbers
for me.
So, we buy for roughly $10
from them,
No, it's not.
No, Joe, here's where
I'm disconnecting, right?
Okay.
Why can the manufacturers
not convey
to their customers
that this is
a better?quality product
that is easier to maintain,
looks better?
Why are they not able to sell it
for a premium?
One of the issues is that
the window manufacturers
are not terribly good marketers.
So, even though
we have something better ??
No, no, it's not about them
not being good marketers.
It's on <i>you</i> not being
a good enough marketer.
So, why haven't you been able
to get the message out?
I could invest the $800,000
with you, Joe,
What if I said to you,
"Okay, Joe, I'm interested,
but all I want to do is take
this better mousetrap,
better patent,
better screen,
Altieri: Every single one
is custom?made.
Wow.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So, now you see where
some of the things like,
"Oh, you can't
just ship them from,"
you know, "New Mexico
up to Pittsburgh."
But why custom?made?
But, Joe, you can't!
You can't.
No, I see where
you're trying to go, Joe.
Mm?hmm.
I have to assume
that you went
to the manufacturers
Joe, I would like
to give you an offer.
Wow.
But I want to tell you,
I replace the screens
in my beach house
every third year.
Those damn mosquitos
find a way of getting in, okay?
[ Chuckles ]
I'm listening to you.
I am in the habit
of ordering screens,
Altieri:
She wants to start a retail ??
The other company
to manufacture
[ Laughs ]
Cuban: Honestly, Joe,
I think she's right.
I'll make you an offer.
I'm gonna take you to the
number?one window manufacturer.
I want to take
this better mousetrap,
get them to use it
on every window,
which I don't think
you've really tried to do yet.
I'll give you the $800,000,
I want 20% of the business,
straight equity,
but I only want to work
with one big manufacturer.
I don't want to do
all the rest of this crap.
Herjavec: You've got
two offers already.
One Shark's out,
two are...
Altieri: Yes.
...thinking.
Another one's coming.
Altieri: Mm?hmm.
A lot of my entrepreneurs
are in the hardware space.
Herjavec: Joe, you were looking
for 6%. She only wants 10%.
This is a great offer.
Lori's
in a very happy mood.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Yeah.
Okay, I'll make it a little
more interesting for you.
I'll loan you
the entire $800,000, okay?
I'm gonna charge you 9%
on it.
I'm gonna take 6% equity
in the company.
It's venture debt.
Joe, the window of opportunity
is closing.
Pick one.
O'Leary: You know,
the simplest deal is mine
'cause it doesn't have
any contingencies.
If the business fails,
I get wiped out. Let's be clear.
My younger brother, Marty,
Joe, in Oregon,
is in your business.
Really?
He's a huge hit.
Thank you, guys.
Good job, Joe.
It's going to change everything
about our company,
