My name's Joe Altieri,
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
and I am the inventor
and owner of FlexScreen.
I am asking for $800,000
in exchange
for 6% of my company.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Wow.
Everybody hates window screens.
They [Clears throat]
are next to impossible
to install and remove,
they block more of your view
than you realize,
and, of course...
this happens.
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
And I'm here today
to show you a better way.
This is FlexScreen,
the world's first and only
flexible window screen.
That's cool.
Everybody knows
the pain associated
with removing
your window screens.
Check this out.
Wow.
Wow.
Can't do that
with a regular window screen,
and you definitely can't do this
with a traditional screen.
Wow.
[ Laughs ]
FlexScreen
is an industry disrupter
and absolutely everything you
could want in a window screen.
So, who wants to join
the FlexScreen revolution
and help millions of people
enjoy their view?
What is the trim actually
made out of,
and what is
the screen material?
Yeah, so, the screen material
is standard screen material.
There's nothing different
about the material itself
compared to traditional
window screens.
Oh.
So, this is the technology.
It's actually ?? this is a piece
of our frame material.
So, it's only the frame
that's the difference?
So, the inner core of this
is high?carbon oil?tempered
spring steel.
It's garage?door spring
material.
Joe, how did you come up
with the idea?
So, I, um ?? I'm a window guy.
For about 20 years,
I sold window screens.
So, window manufacturers
have two options ??
they can buy screens
or they can make them
themselves.
So, my job was to go in
and convince somebody
to let me produce
their window screens for them.
So, um,
I just started, you know,
messing around in my garage,
trying to come up with something
that wouldn't get damaged
as easily ??
my bubble?gum
and duct?tape prototype.
And since I was
in the industry,
showed it off to some people,
and they went bananas for it.
They said, "Hey,
get some patents,
because somebody's gonna
rip you off,
because there hasn't been
anything new
in the window industry
for a very, very long time.
Okay, Joe, I totally agree
you're the window guy.
I'm sure everybody else up here
thinks the same thing.
But I'm an investor guy,
and you're asking me
for $800,000 for 6% ??
imputes a $13.3 million
valuation.
Wow.
Obviously,
we have to get to sales.
You better have some.
What do you got?
Year one, $400,000 in sales.
?Okay.
?Year two, $2 million in sales.
Ah.
Year three, $3.5 million.
Yes.
Year four, which is last year,
$5.1 million.
I'm liking it.
Wow.
What profits did you make
after you paid yourself
and everybody else?
So, last year, we only ??
we only cleared about $40,000.
?Ooh!
?At $5.5 million?!
?Wow. Wow, wow, wow.
Now, here's the thing ??
We are ??
Joe, baby, sweetie, honey,
what happened?
Well, we're reinvesting.
Herjavec: What was
your gross margin?
$700,000 last year.
?Out of five ??
?Why isn't your ??
So, that's ??
What is that?
That's the problem.
About 15%?
Roughly, yes.
Why isn't
your margin higher?
You're a manufacturer.
Shouldn't your margin be
quite a bit higher?
Well, so, we have
four manufacturing plants,
but they're actually
licensed manufacturers for us.
We don't actually own
the plants.
Thank God.
Well,
you buy from them.
Wait, did I hear
you're a royalty business?
Very similar
to a royalty business.
Yippee?i?o?ki?yay.
Yes, I'm speaking
your language here.
Break down the numbers
for me.
So, we buy for roughly $10
from them,
and we sell for $11.50.
Wow.
Wow. Ouch.
Now, this is to
the window manufacturers.
That wasn't a "Wow, good."
Cuban: Why can't you sell
for more of a premium?
If you're the only one
and you dominate this market,
why aren't you selling them
for $15 instead of $11.50?
Because
the window manufacturers
can only get
so much for a window.
The market is absolutely huge.
So, what you're saying,
people are not willing
to pay a premium.
Well, you're not selling
to people, though.
I'm selling
to the window manufacturers.
Like I said,
that's our core business.
Why don't you let them
just do the manufacturing
and the sales
and you get a royalty?
That's an option for us.
But of course!
It's the only option!
Because you're making no money.
You're killing yourself.
No, it's not.
No, Joe, here's where
I'm disconnecting, right?
Okay.
Why can the manufacturers
not convey
to their customers
that this is
a better?quality product
that is easier to maintain,
looks better?
Why are they not able to sell it
for a premium?
One of the issues is that
the window manufacturers
are not terribly good marketers.
So, even though
we have something better ??
No, no, it's not about them
not being good marketers.
It's on <i>you</i> not being
a good enough marketer.
So, why haven't you been able
to get the message out?
Well, and we have been.
I mean, we're gonna do
$10 million in sales this year.
But you're gonna make
$80,000 on it.
That sucks!
No, no, no, that ?? that ??
I could invest the $800,000
with you, Joe,
and die of old age
before I ever get it back.
If I stopped everything today,
I would make $1 million
this year.
What if I said to you,
"Okay, Joe, I'm interested,
but all I want to do is take
this better mousetrap,
better patent,
better screen,
go to the screen guys,
and say,
'I want to license this
to you.
You're going to manufacture it
into your windows
and have the advantage
of a better screen'?"
I'm really good
at negotiating those deals.
Do you like that model versus
all the crap you're doing now?
Because you're spinning
your wheels so hard
and making no money.
Would you go
to that model?
So, to answer your question,
absolutely.
We've talked
to the major manufacturers.
And?
But the fact of the matter is,
we had to kind of get out
and make a name for ourselves.
So, you're saying you couldn't
get them to license it from you
unless you proved it
in the market first?
They want to be
very fast followers.
But you have done it.
Yes.
You've now got $5 million
through this horrible way
of making no money,
'cause you're buying it
from yourself, basically,
and then reselling it
with tiny margins.
So, you can sell
to the public.
Absolutely.
We just started on the Internet
with our own e?commerce,
and we've done no marketing
as far as ??
Are the sizes standard,
Joe,
so any guy can just order one
for his window?
They're all custom?made.
Every one
is custom?made?
Altieri: Every single one
is custom?made.
Wow.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So, now you see where
some of the things like,
"Oh, you can't
just ship them from,"
you know, "New Mexico
up to Pittsburgh."
But why custom?made?
Well, but aren't there
standard?size windows?
Yeah, aren't the windows
all to standard?
No. The window industry
is very, very custom.
But every customer has
to be custom?made?
Mm?hmm.
Yeah, but I go into Lowe's,
and there's screens
all over the place.
Greiner: Yeah.
I mean, if
a traditional screen
doesn't need to be custom?made,
why do yours?
They do. Again, if you buy
a window at Lowe's,
they might have the
replacement screens at Lowe's.
Corcoran: Hold it.
But for the most part,
if you need ??
But they're
all different sizes.
They're all different sizes.
That's just crazy to me.
You have a better product...
It's amazing.
...each one is custom?made,
and you only have
15% margins.
I mean, if I invested, I'd be
like ?? pbht ?? crush that.
We're going to
100%?plus margins.
I don't care if I sell
10% as much,
but I'm gonna make
a whole lot more money.
We want volume.
We want to be the every screen
out there on these windows.
Every window that goes out ??
No, you want to be
the premium screen.
Because
in the next couple years,
as it becomes the standard
in the industry,
I can charge whatever I want.
But, Joe, you can't!
You can't.
No, I see where
you're trying to go, Joe.
Mm?hmm.
I have to assume
that you went
to the manufacturers
and tried to sell it
for more,
and the manufacturers
said to you,
"Our consumers don't care."
They said, "This is great.
It's a premium product."
It solves a lot
of problems for them.
"But I'm not willing
to pay more."
Not a lot more.
I'm out.
Joe, I would like
to give you an offer.
Wow.
But I want to tell you,
I replace the screens
in my beach house
every third year.
Those damn mosquitos
find a way of getting in, okay?
[ Chuckles ]
I'm listening to you.
I am in the habit
of ordering screens,
and I noticed when I have
the catalogue,
'cause I keep it now,
there are certain screen sizes,
but the great majority
of the sales
are roughly
12 different screen sizes,
from what I could see.
So, my offer is independent
of what you're doing right now.
I'll give you $400,000
in cash,
$400,000 in credit
to be used to manufacture
standard sizes,
and I want to take 50%
of the right
to sell it online
and in stores.
I think this is
a huge profit?maker,
but you just went down
the wrong road to begin with.
Wow.
Your go?to?market strategy
was awful.
Corcoran: Yeah.
Like, 50% of the equity
in this other company,
alright?
What other company?
Altieri:
She wants to start a retail ??
The other company
to manufacture
and produce consumer goods
in standard sizes to be sold.
That's it.
You keep doing your deal
with the other guys.
That's how much she hates
your business model.
[ Laughs ]
Cuban: Honestly, Joe,
I think she's right.
I'll make you an offer.
I'm gonna take you to the
number?one window manufacturer.
I want to take
this better mousetrap,
get them to use it
on every window,
which I don't think
you've really tried to do yet.
I'll give you the $800,000,
I want 20% of the business,
straight equity,
but I only want to work
with one big manufacturer.
I don't want to do
all the rest of this crap.
Herjavec: You've got
two offers already.
One Shark's out,
two are...
Altieri: Yes.
...thinking.
Another one's coming.
Joe has two offers on the table,
from Kevin and Barbara,
for his flexible window screen
company, FlexScreen.
But Lori is also interested.
I like selling
to the window manufacturers,
and I like selling
to the consumer.
So, I would give you
$400,000 up front,
then I'd give you $400,000
as a line of credit.
I'm gonna do it
at 3?year, 6%.
That's the interest.
Interest, right,
on the loan.
I'm gonna want still
10% equity stake in the company,
and I'll tell you why.
I can help you
get that to fit
into other windows
all over
and make it more standard
so that then you can be
more successful
when you go into retail
at Lowe's and Home Depot.
Herjavec:
That's a great offer.
And I have been heavily
in the hardware space.
Altieri: Mm?hmm.
A lot of my entrepreneurs
are in the hardware space.
And, um, I think
that we could
really do something great
with this,
'cause I think you need
to be to the consumer
Herjavec: Joe, you were looking
for 6%. She only wants 10%.
This is a great offer.
Lori's
in a very happy mood.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Yeah.
Okay, I'll make it a little
more interesting for you.
I'll loan you
the entire $800,000, okay?
I'm gonna charge you 9%
on it.
I'm gonna take 6% equity
in the company.
It's venture debt.
And then I won't put
any covenants on you,
but I'll guide your team in
terms of how to make more money,
'cause I know
how to fix this problem.
Mark,
are you in or out?
I think, you know, what
these guys have said is right.
You know, you need to be able
to use your factories better.
I'm not the window guy,
even though I like
to help everybody
from Pittsburgh,
but for those reasons,
I'm out.
Joe, the window of opportunity
is closing.
Pick one.
O'Leary: You know,
the simplest deal is mine
'cause it doesn't have
any contingencies.
If the business fails,
I get wiped out. Let's be clear.
And the smartest deal is mine
because it will make you
the most money.
Too complicated,
Barbara.
It's not complicated at all.
I don't understand it.
Truthfully, I mean,
I appreciate all the offers.
I'm leaning towards ??
no offense, Mr. Wonderful ??
to one of the beautiful ladies.
Well, why don't you pick
the prettiest girl?
I'm right here.
[ Laughs ]
Why don't you offer Lori
the side of the business
that's the clunker, where
you have ?? making you money?
I don't see that side
of your business as a clunker.
She's excited, okay?
I like my side of the business.
Mm.
I like
the window manufacturers,
so, you know, having a separate
retail company, um...
Interesting, interesting.
...I'm actually
leaning towards that.
Ooh.
And I'll tell you
something else.
My younger brother, Marty,
Joe, in Oregon,
is in your business.
Really?
He's a huge hit.
And he's looking
to do something else.
Guess what, Joe.
I'd help you get it.
I'll do that same deal.
You can't get
my brother Marty, Lori.
[ Laughter ]
No. I can't get Marty.
I can't get Marty,
but I'll do the same deal.
Um, would either one of you
be willing
to up the cash
versus the line of credit
to sweeten the pot?
No.
What are you going to do?
I, uh ?? I do think that you
have the better connections
with the hardware space,
and I've love to partner up
with you on that deal.
Ah [bleep]
Whoo!
I mean, oh, damn it!
[ Laughter ]
?Awesome.
?Wow.
Corcoran: Well,
that's not only losing a deal,
but watching somebody steal
your idea <i>and</i> lose the deal.
Sorry, Barb.
I'm sorry.
That's alright...
Congratulations.
...I guess.
Thank you, guys.
Good job, Joe.
It's going to change everything
about our company,
and partnering with Lori
is gonna be fantastic.
I'm just so excited,
I can't even contain myself.
Ooh, Barbara's giving me
the evil stare.
Lori, it wasn't fair.
You to play dirty,
and I don't like it.
But I'm a lot prettier than you,
so I'm gonna get over it.
[ Laughs ]
