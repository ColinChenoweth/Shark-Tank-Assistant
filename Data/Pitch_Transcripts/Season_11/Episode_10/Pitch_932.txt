Hi, Sharks. I'm Dale Lewis,
founder of Fortress Clothing.
I'm seeking $600,000
for 15% equity in my company.
The problem
with cold?weather clothing is,
Lewis: Fortress delivers
on three promises,
due to our patented, innovative
disruptive technology.
Number one ??
you'll be warm even if wet.
Lewis:
You got to get in there.
Let me take you back
to our samples.
Lewis: So, Lori.
Yes.
This is special?made for you.
It's our prototype.
[ Gasps ] I love it.
Together with our
winter gloves,
the warmest gloves
you'll ever own.
Thank you.
Being a Canadian, I know
you'll absolutely appreciate
a nice vest
with our all?purpose gloves.
Cool.
Barbara,
this is our hoodie.
We did this
on a Kickstarter.
Ooh, I love hoodies.
Is that what Robert has on,
Dale? The base layer?
So, yeah, typically,
you wear this next to skin.
?[ Laughs ]
?Go like this, Robert.
?So, come on in.
?Put him in.
Throw him in.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Okay.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
Lock him up.
Oh, my God.
Okay, hit him.
Let's go to 300 below.
Lewis: So, the longer the door
is shut, the colder it gets.
?I'm worried.
?Hit him again!
Skyler:
Are you guys worried?
O'Leary: I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.
Greiner: Robert,
are you breathing?
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughing ] It's cold!
[ Laughter ]
So, Dale,
who is my market?
Am I trying to sell
to the people
that are working
in extreme temperatures?
I mean, there's not
too many places on Earth
that are 200 below zero.
Right.
Okay.
How did it feel?
It ?? It's freezing.
Like, my toes are ??
Really?
They feel like they're gonna
fall off, seriously.
Really?
But really incredible ??
the top, nothing.
The top was good.
Wow.
So, we have a proprietary
disruptive insulation technology
that is amazing.
In all of these products?
All of these products
contain our insulation.
Well, let's define
our market.
?Yes.
?Who are we going after?
Okay, so, why am I here?
Because I need
an influencer with power,
Lewis: This is so horrible.
You'll see by my face it is...
Ohh!
Ohh.
?It's so dangerous.
?Ugh!
You cannot breathe.
But that's <i>in</i> the water.
Once you get
out of the water,
within 45 seconds,
you are absolutely warm.
I am curious about you,
though.
Are you a scientist?
What's your background?
No, no, no.
So, you'll love this.
I'm a serial entrepreneur,
had three colossal failures,
seven years of famine.
[ Voice breaking ]
You, uh...
Excuse me.
Where you're so poor,
it affects your self?esteem.
Like, I'm serious.
We have eight children,
[ Laughs ]
You have eight kids,
Dale?
Yeah.
That would make me cry, too.
[ Chuckles ]
Anyway. [ Clears throat ]
Excuse me.
The fourth one
was this awesome success.
Corcoran: Dale, if you had
patented technology,
did you not think
about selling the technology
to people
who manufacture clothing,
versus do it yourself?
You know, Dale,
it's missing focus on marketing,
Herjavec: Dale, I have to
tell you, I love this,
but the message,
it's so confusing!
You're selling
to oil workers.
Then you're jumping into water
in the Arctic somewhere.
But he needs direction.
Dale, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
No, I know.
I really wanted you
to get me excited.
[ Sighs ]
But I got to
tell you, man,
you are drowning
in opportunity.
I know.
I just want to be successful
in one category. That's it.
I would've been happy
to go along for that niche.
But, my friend...
But that's what I'm saying ??
I'm sorry.
Too much opportunity
for me.
I'm out.
Dale, you've sold
technology before.
Congrats on your successes.
When you're trying
to sell technology,
Alright.
Good luck, Dale.
Thanks.
Appreciate your time.
?Do the long underwear.
?Okay.
Lewis: I am absolutely shocked
because I expected
two or three Sharks
to get in on this deal.
