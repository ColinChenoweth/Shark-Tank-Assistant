Hi, Sharks. I'm Dale Lewis,
founder of Fortress Clothing.
I'm seeking $600,000
for 15% equity in my company.
The problem
with cold?weather clothing is,
once you're cold, you get sweaty
and cold and wet.
And once you're wet,
your day is over.
Fortress has solved
that problem.
So, I can lose the parka...
I can lose the hoodie...
I don't need a windbreaker...
and this long?sleeved tee
goes away.
You just lost
a lot of weight.
Corcoran:
Wow, you look better.
?Thank you.
?[ Laughs ]
Lewis: Fortress delivers
on three promises,
due to our patented, innovative
disruptive technology.
Number one ??
you'll be warm even if wet.
And number two ?? you'll be warm
with fewer additional layers.
And three ??
an amazing comfort spectrum.
Skyler, how cold is it
over there in the tank?
?112 Fahrenheit.
And it's gonna prove
how amazing his product is.
And, Robert, since you had
the opportunity
of being in a cryotank
several years ago,
we brought special samples
for you
to experience the technology.
?Oh, I want to try it.
?Oh, yeah. Put him in the tank!
Lewis:
You got to get in there.
Let me take you back
to our samples.
Lewis: So, Lori.
Yes.
This is special?made for you.
It's our prototype.
[ Gasps ] I love it.
Together with our
winter gloves,
the warmest gloves
you'll ever own.
Thank you.
Being a Canadian, I know
you'll absolutely appreciate
a nice vest
with our all?purpose gloves.
Cool.
Barbara,
this is our hoodie.
We did this
on a Kickstarter.
Ooh, I love hoodies.
And, Mark.
Pleasure to meet you.
This is our parka
together with our ski
or snowmobile gloves.
Cuban: Cool.
What are you wearing?
So, I'm wearing
our base layer.
I think it looks cool,
but if you say
it's as warm as it is,
look how sleek it is.
Yeah, this is comfortable
from 70 down to ?10 degrees.
That's amazing.
And we also manufacture gear.
O'Leary: Robert,
I'm ready for you.
Is that what Robert has on,
Dale? The base layer?
So, yeah, typically,
you wear this next to skin.
?[ Laughs ]
?Go like this, Robert.
?So, come on in.
?Put him in.
Throw him in.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Okay.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
Lock him up.
Oh, my God.
Okay, hit him.
Let's go to 300 below.
Lewis: So, the longer the door
is shut, the colder it gets.
?I'm worried.
?Hit him again!
Skyler:
Are you guys worried?
O'Leary: I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.
Greiner: Robert,
are you breathing?
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughing ] It's cold!
[ Laughter ]
?How are your hands?
?It's cold!
[ Laughter ]
Are you okay?
[ Laughter ]
Oh, that's good.
Oh, God.
So, Dale,
who is my market?
Am I trying to sell
to the people
that are working
in extreme temperatures?
I mean, there's not
too many places on Earth
that are 200 below zero.
Right.
Okay.
How did it feel?
It ?? It's freezing.
Like, my toes are ??
Really?
They feel like they're gonna
fall off, seriously.
Really?
But really incredible ??
the top, nothing.
The top was good.
Wow.
So, we have a proprietary
disruptive insulation technology
that is amazing.
In all of these products?
All of these products
contain our insulation.
Well, let's define
our market.
?Yes.
?Who are we going after?
Okay, so, why am I here?
Because I need
an influencer with power,
and I need
your distribution channels.
So, what have you sold?
So, we have historically sold
$3.5 million
company to?date since 2012.
Wow.
Seven years?
You've been doing this
since ??
So, what did you do
the last 12 months?
Uh, well, 2018,
we did $407,000.
The issue is, we had
all this great growth,
built a reputation,
and oil, if you'll remember,
went from $80 to $100
to $140 and then, boom, bust,
down to $30?something
a barrel.
That was
your primary market?
You're trying to sell
to the industrial client?
Yes. See, the problem is,
we have so much opportunity.
We could be everywhere.
So, we were trying
to be focused on oil.
Well, what that did is, it made
it so we couldn't stay alive.
But you want to go
into full retail now?
What do you want to do?
Greiner: Well,
but wait a minute.
How are you different
from your competitors?
So, the value proposition
is that we do
the three things we claim ??
one, you can be
soaking wet and warm.
But does it breathe?
Does it let in ??
So, let's say
you fall into...
Why is it solved for wet?
You're ice fishing,
and you fall in.
Like, it's
freezing?cold water.
Yes.
What happens?
So, I have a video
to demonstrate that.
Oh.
This is me.
I'm wearing
our Fortress layer
and then just
some basic underwear.
?Oh, my gosh!
?You're not gonna do that.
?Don't do it!
?This is 3 1/2 feet of ice,
and it really sucks.
?No!
?Ohh!
?Oh, my gosh!
Lewis: This is so horrible.
You'll see by my face it is...
Ohh!
Ohh.
?It's so dangerous.
?Ugh!
You cannot breathe.
But that's <i>in</i> the water.
Once you get
out of the water,
within 45 seconds,
you are absolutely warm.
I am curious about you,
though.
Are you a scientist?
What's your background?
No, no, no.
So, you'll love this.
I'm a serial entrepreneur,
had three colossal failures,
seven years of famine.
[ Voice breaking ]
You, uh...
Excuse me.
Where you're so poor,
it affects your self?esteem.
Like, I'm serious.
We have eight children,
and, um, I was trying to hook up
this new business,
and each time ??
My kids bet me how long
it would be before I cried.
Aww.
O'Leary:
The bad times are gone.
[ Laughs ]
You have eight kids,
Dale?
Yeah.
That would make me cry, too.
[ Chuckles ]
Anyway. [ Clears throat ]
Excuse me.
The fourth one
was this awesome success.
Excuse me. [ Sighs ]
Okay, and...
So, you blow up three times,
and the fourth is magic.
Blow up three times,
the fourth one was magic.
So, now the fun part.
I built
a telecommunications company
from zero to $33 million
over nine years.
I'm assuming
you sold this.
And then I had a liquidity event
and retired when I was 40.
And ?? Thank you.
It's the American dream.
It really is.
Yes, it is.
O'Leary: What's missing
in this deal is,
it's undefined
where I go next.
I don't know
where to go with this thing.
I give you my $600,000,
and I don't know
how I get it back,
'cause I'm only getting
15% of the company,
and you haven't really decided
what you're gonna do.
?No, no, no.
If you're going
after the fashion space,
then you're competing
with all these mega marketers.
Right.
?Yep.
?That's very hard.
But you haven't done
any of that stuff.
You're selling direct
to guys in the oil field.
So, that's where I think
I'm coming to you
and saying I'm looking
for the low?hanging fruit.
You are influencers, and
you have distribution channels.
You don't have
a market to find.
No, right now,
we're gonna continue
to do the industrial workwear
together with the outdoorsmen.
Corcoran: Dale, if you had
patented technology,
did you not think
about selling the technology
to people
who manufacture clothing,
versus do it yourself?
We did, and we were told no,
because it was
an unproven technology.
They wanted market validation,
and that is why
we created Fortress ??
to go get market validation.
I see.
O'Leary: Here's a question.
I like the style
of that...Catwoman thing.
The base layer.
That looks interesting.
Greiner: Me too.
Now,
I ski in St. Moritz.
It's the coldest mountain
in Switzerland.
It's about 28 below
on the top.
Awesome.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Alright?
If I just wore that,
I'd look great on the mountain,
which I care about.
No. No, no, no.
Then you'd wear
your outer shell of choice.
Why can't I just wear this,
what you're wearing,
to go skiing?
Greiner: With nothing, yeah.
Oh, 'cause it doesn't have
a wind?stop.
It doesn't have
the wind stopper?
So, think of this
as insulated thermal underwear.
Okay.
Normally, you'd just throw
some sort of shell over it.
Greiner: Here's what's
confusing for me.
I think the look is good,
the technology sounds good,
but I'm still not getting
how this is gonna beat
what else is out
on the market.
And the thought
of a shell on top, for me,
disconnects to how cool
I think the look is,
'cause it takes away from that.
I don't think
I'm the right partner.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay. I think maybe
after a little while,
you might come back in.
So...
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: Let me say
a couple of things.
Please.
I think
your best positioning
is that you are
Fortress underwear company.
Yeah.
You drop on a parka,
you go skiing.
You drop on a parka,
you go ice fishing.
You drop on a parka,
it's just a thin layer.
It's a good idea.
And I think also having
all these garments
is confusing
for a consumer.
I think it should be one thing
that applies to many industries.
What's wrong with positioning
as an underwear company?
That caught my attention.
And we're open to that.
Well, I'm not open to it.
Oh, okay.
Because
it came too late.
That's a good idea, Barb.
But I...
Yeah, but it would be
a whole new business
you'd have to build.
You know, Fortress
long underwear, right?
So, I wish I had the energy
for that and enthusiasm for it.
But sadly, I am out.
You know, Dale,
it's missing focus on marketing,
and I have a very hard time
parting with $600,000
to test different ideas.
I can't go there with you.
I don't see a strategy.
I'm out.
Herjavec: Dale, I have to
tell you, I love this,
but the message,
it's so confusing!
You're selling
to oil workers.
Then you're jumping into water
in the Arctic somewhere.
But he needs direction.
And let me clarify.
Dale, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
No, I know.
I really wanted you
to get me excited.
[ Sighs ]
But I got to
tell you, man,
you are drowning
in opportunity.
I know.
I just want to be successful
in one category. That's it.
I would've been happy
to go along for that niche.
But, my friend...
But that's what I'm saying ??
I'm sorry.
Too much opportunity
for me.
I'm out.
Dale, you've sold
technology before.
Congrats on your successes.
When you're trying
to sell technology,
it has to be clean
and simple
how you're differentiated
and why you're better.
If the bodysuit,
if you told me I could
just go skiing,
I could go running,
and as long
as it's not windy,
you're gonna be
completely warm
and you're gonna be
comfortable, great.
Mm.
Right?
That's something
to look at.
But that's not
what you conveyed to me,
and to their point, you're
bouncing around a little bit
because you're trying to say
you want to do too much.
I think you'll figure it out,
but for those reasons,
I'm out.
Alright.
Good luck, Dale.
Thanks.
Appreciate your time.
?Do the long underwear.
?Okay.
Lewis: I am absolutely shocked
because I expected
two or three Sharks
to get in on this deal.
I think I confused them,
and my bad ??
I should've done
a better job communicating.
