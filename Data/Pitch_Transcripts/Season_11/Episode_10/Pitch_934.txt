Hi, Sharks. I'm Katy,
and this is my mom, Lou.
We're from
Atlanta, Georgia,
and we're here seeking
$400,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company, SlumberPod.
Lou: Parents don't deserve
to be sleep?deprived
and miserable on trips.
[ Laughter ]
So, we decided to kick
those sleepless nights
to the curb
and create our own
easy solution.
Both: SlumberPod!
Yay!
It's a portable
privacy pod
that gives your baby its own
dark and private place to sleep.
It's a tent.
Once your SlumberPod
is assembled,
simply slide it over
your travel crib.
And just like that...
[ Laughter ]
...sleep is moments away.
Greiner:
Poor little baby!
[ Laughter ]
Designed with your baby's
safety in mind...
...it's made
of breathable fabric...
Oh, no.
[ Child crying ]
[ Laughter ]
Cuban:
That kid is not having it.
Aww!
Lou: SlumberPod is made
of breathable fabric,
it weighs less
than 6 pounds,
and best of all,
it fits in carry?on luggage.
Our customers call our product
a life?saver,
a game?changer,
and a marriage?saver.
I don't know!
[ Laughter, crying continues ]
Sharks, don't sleep
on this amazing opportunity.
Ohh.
So, who's ready
to join us
in creating
more nighty?nights?
Next time,
use a fake baby.
Herjavec:
Let the child out!
[ Crying continues ]
?Aww!
?Alright, Oscar.
It's okay.
Oh, my gosh, great job!
Good night, Oscar.
[ Cheers and applause ]
[ Laughter ]
Those are real tears, damn it!
Real tears!
Believe it or not,
Oscar actually sleeps in this
every night at home.
He's just having
a little stage anxiety.
Lou: Thank you.
?Bye.
?Bye, Oscar.
The slumber prison
costs how much, and what
do you sell it for?
[ Laughs ]
"Slumber prison."
We sell for $149.99,
and the landed cost is $56.
Lou, how did you come up with
the idea of a tent for children?
So, when I was home
for the Christmas holidays
when my oldest daughter
was a year and a half,
we had to stay
in the same room with her.
That room didn't have
great window treatments,
so some light
was coming through...
Mm.
...and she kept waking up
in the night,
seeing us
across the room,
and not understanding that
she needed to stay in the bed
and that it wasn't time
to wake up.
I think we got two or three
hours of sleep a night
two nights in a row,
to the point where
we went home a day early.
Like, sleep deprivation
is a military torture tactic
because it makes you
miserable and crazy, right?
So are twins.
Yeah.
That's a good point also.
[ Laughter ]
How long will it take you
to put it back in a box?
Breaking it down probably takes
two minutes or less,
and then putting in the bag,
another 30 seconds.
Must you have
the Pack 'n Play?
Otherwise, the child
crawls out from under it.
That's a great question,
Barbara.
So, it also fits
a toddler cot inside,
or you could make a pallet
on the floor out of blankets.
And it's not designed
to confine a child.
It's designed to create
a dark and private
sleep environment.
It looks
really complicated.
There are instructions
sewn right into the bag.
It's simple as setting up
a camping tent.
And, you know, it may look
a little bit...
cumbersome...
Scary.
...but what you make up for that
is in how small it gets.
That's what allows it
to fit in carry?on luggage.
Have you started
selling them?
Yes.
How much are your sales?
We launched in August,
and then this year,
we've done $556,000.
?Wow.
?That's really good.
?Man!
?What a surprise.
How? Why, Lou?
How and why did it take off?
Because moms
are obsessed.
They love to talk
about things that work,
and they love to put it
on Instagram.
No advertising?
We've done
very limited advertising.
So, you guys have got to be
just so profitable
and just generating cash,
printing money.
We became profitable
in February.
We have no debt.
What is your background?
Tell us about you.
I actually went back
to college
as a single mom
at 39 years old...
Good for you.
?Good for you.
?Wow.
...and got
my master's degree at 50,
and I've worked for Fortune 500
and small software companies.
Cuban: Good for you.
Um, so that's
my background.
How about you, Katy?
She's also a mom
to six kids,
and I'm the oldest
of those kids.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm in the automotive space
currently,
and I'm a mom to three.
I have
3?year?old twins.
So, I think about sometimes,
if I had given away
a percentage of my business,
would it have been
right for me?
Or was it better that I had
to figure out everything
and do it myself,
which made me stronger,
smarter, better,
and not a one?person company
anymore?
I don't say this often,
but I think you should
continue to do
what you're doing.
Because I truly
believe that,
I'm going to go out.
Thank you.
Obviously, we have
mixed feelings
about that response,
but thank you.
[ Laughs ]
I want to add
to Lori's story, if I may,
because something
happened to me
that was a real lesson
in my career.
I was in a terrible
real?estate recession,
I owed the whole world
so much money,
and, as luck
would have it,
Merrill Lynch came
and offered to buy my business.
They offered me $250,000.
But here's what happened ??
they changed their mind,
and I thought the sky
had fallen.
And do you know,
it was only five years later
I sold my business
for $66 million?
To Lori's valid point,
be careful
when you sell your stock.
But that being said, I want
to take advantage of you.
in Lou and Katy's
child sleeping tent, SlumberPod.
Be careful
when you sell your stock.
But that being said, I want
to take advantage of you.
[ Laughter ]
That's the truth.
She's nothing
if not honest, right?
So, I'm gonna offer you
$400,000 for 25%,
but I have
one contingency.
I don't want to wait forever
to be paid back.
Every time you sell something ??
you name the number ??
I just want some
kind of a payment
so that I know
I'm getting paid back first,
get that money out.
But I'll be
a terrific partner.
And I need you to answer ??
O'Leary: Katy and Lou,
I'm gonna put some pressure
on Barbara.
Wait.
And I need you
to answer me now.
25%, that's a savage offer
and greedy,
and I don't like that.
That's not greedy at all.
I do not appreciate
that kind of greed.
I'm gonna loan you $400,000
at 9% for three years.
That'll cover
all your inventory costs.
And I'm going to take
7% equity for that loan.
You're getting
a bidding war going here.
Oh, there's just greed
and reasonableness.
Come on, Robert.
[ Clicks tongue ]
Barbara made you
a really fair offer.
I would've made
a more aggressive offer.
I'm out.
Thank you.
O'Leary: Mark, are you in?
Guys, I'm gonna share a story
similar to Barbara's.
When we had started
broadcast.com as AudioNet
and we were the first streaming
company in the country
and Microsoft got
into that business
and Microsoft
invited us up
and we started talking
about an offer ??
And to Barbara's point,
we thought we were right there
for an offer that was gonna be
for $75 million.
Gosh,
better than my story.
Didn't get that offer.
Didn't get that offer.
But, two years later,
we sold for $5.7 billion
because we didn't take
that offer.
I'm out.
This is more than money.
We're looking for someone
to help us scale.
Exactly.
We're looking
for those relationships.
You just don't have to give
all that up.
They want to help you.
Of course they want
you to be successful.
Yeah.
