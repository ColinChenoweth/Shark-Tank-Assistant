My name is Chico.
And my name's Mason.
We're both
from Portland, Oregon,
and our company
is Zuum Technologies.
We're here seeking
a $125,000 investment
in exchange
for 20% of our company.
The trend
towards electric rideables
has been taking the U. S.
by storm!
From electric scooters
popping up
all over cities overnight
to everyone and their mother
wanting a hoverboard,
consumers are fascinated with
the idea of electric rideables,
and they're eager
to hop onto the trend.
That's where we got the idea
to start our company
and introduce Zuum shoes
to the market.
Zuum shoes
are individual self?balancing
platforms for your feet
that go up to a top speed
of 8 miles per hour,
with an average ride time
of 1 hour.
Mason, why don't we show
the Sharks how they work.
Let's do it.
With Zuum shoes,
there are a ton of different
ways you can ride them.
You can easily
maneuver through,
as well as over,
different objects.
But the best part
about Zuum shoes is,
you can practice
your sick dance moves.
Hit it, Chics!
[ Beatboxing ]
[ Laughter ]
Wow, just like Kevin.
We're two young
entrepreneurs
that are dedicated
to making electric rideables
accessible to the masses.
Both: So, Sharks,
who wants to hop on early
and Zuum with us
towards the future?
I want to try it.
Remember your children.
Mark, you want to try?
No.
Alright,
make sure you get on.
And, yeah, you basically
just lean forward to go forward.
?Oh, my God.
?Oh, my God, they're so cool.
Backwards
to go backwards.
Greiner: Do you feel like
you're gonna fall off?
Ah, come on, Lori,
it's me.
[ Laughs ]
Whoo!
Come on, baby!
Aah!
Bye, Robert!
[ Laughs ] Lock the doors!
Bye!
?Whoo!
?Oh, he's got it down.
?Whoo!
?Oh!
Cuban: Yeah,
that whole stop thing.
Greiner: Wait, wait, wait.
Could he stop himself or not?
It's like a hoverboard.
Getting on is not hard.
It's getting off
that's hard.
Exactly.
Herjavec:
It's a little harder to stop.
?Nice job.
?That was awesome!
[ Beeping ]
Greiner: But what if
you're in a city, right?
There's potholes,
there's, like, divots
in the streets,
sidewalks are
always like this.
So, what happens then?
Right. So,
we don't really see it
as an alternative
to walking in the city.
Oh.
Mason: The cool thing
about the Zuum shoes is,
you can throw them
in your backpack.
What is the price?
$299.
?$299?
?Wow.
What do they cost
landed?
Mason: $130.
So, who created this?
So, the manufacturer
designs it,
and we introduced it
into the U. S.
And we met
with a manufacturer
over in China.
We flew over to them.
Ah.
Okay, so, you're a distributor.
You didn't create it.
Okay, so it's
an already?made product.
Mason: Right.
O'Leary: What stops me,
Mr. Wonderful,
from going
to the same manufacturer
and bringing this Zuum out
as the Wonderboard?
What stops me
from doing that?
Nothing.
But what we have is ??
Nothing?!
We have our company,
we have Zuum,
and we ?? in January
of this year,
we launched a Kickstarter
campaign for these,
and we raised $25,000.
Just to get
manufacturing done?
Well, we raised the money
to test the market,
because we really see
Kickstarter as a good way
to see, is there
a proof of concept?
I'm very stuck.
Mason, do you have exclusive
rights on the contract?
Tell me the deal that you made
to bring the product.
We don't have exclusive rights
on the technology.
What?!
Relax, Kevin.
This self?balancing technology
is available for sale.
No, I get that.
But what do you have?
That's the reason
why we're here.
We want to take that money
that we're asking for
to create custom designs.
Ooh, that's a bad idea.
Guys, look, one of the key
things for any entrepreneur
is to know
what business you're in.
If you would have come in
and said, "Here's who we are.
We realize other people
can come in
and sell the same product,
but here's why we are
the best sales organization" ??
you guys didn't come in
and say that, though.
You didn't tell us
that's where your expertise was.
Okay.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
What's your biggest obstacle?
Um ?? Pbht.
I think it would
just be...
I don't know.
What do you think, Chico?
It's capital?intensive
and having the connection
of, like, a Shark.
You're not persuasive
at all.
If you were to ask me
what the obstacle was
with every single business
I've invested in,
in this moment, I can tell you
exactly what
they're confronting,
and they know it.
Okay.
So, our biggest obstacle
with this is capital.
We just ??
We have opportunities.
We just can't fulfill
those opportunities
because we don't have the money
for inventory,
since it is a ??
I have to stop you there.
I have to stop you there.
I have never seen a business,
a young entrepreneur,
inexperienced entrepreneur
whose problem was solved
by money, period.
Yeah.
The thing that solves
every problem is passion,
and I've seen people
make huge successes
without a dime in their pocket
if they have the passion.
So ??
And we will. We will.
If we don't have the capital,
we'll just grow slower,
and we can take it one step
at a time.
I say if you don't have
the passion,
you're not gonna grow,
and for simply that reason,
I'm out.
Both: Thank you, Barbara.
Greiner: I have a question.
What's your competition?
Does Segway have one?
Yes. They came out
with a pair, as well.
They're more expensive, and they
have that brand recognition.
That's why they sell
for higher.
That's everything.
That brand name
is really hard to go up against
when you're small.
So, my confusion here is,
I understand
you're repping products.
That's fine.
that can have so much trouble
down your road.
I feel, because you have
all those issues,
it's not a wise investment
for me today.
So I'm sorry ?? I'm out.
Both: Thank you, Lori.
O'Leary: Guys, let's take stock
where we're at.
You do not own anything
in a very competitive market.
I don't want
to discourage you ??
Well, maybe I do.
I actually think this sucks.
Um...I hate it.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thanks, Kevin.
I'm just trying to go back,
what the game plan is,
'cause I'm a little unclear.
You don't make the product,
you have no exclusivity,
there's nothing proprietary
about your product.
What's the vision?
So, for the vision,
we know some manufacturers
in China
that we want
to innovate
on top of the current
electric scooter market.
We want to create
more of a catalog
of electric rideable
markets.
Robert,
what are you gonna do?
I got to tell you ??
Robert, I'll do this for you.
I'm now Robert.
I'm out.
[ Laughs ]
See you later.
Look, I?I wish you
all the best,
but I don't trust you
with my money.
I just don't trust
you're gonna be a custodian
of my money
and make more of it
with this business.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Greiner: Guys, listen,
hire a great salesperson.
No, go out and sell
yourselves! It's your
product! Figure it out!
Mark, you're not gonna
give a dog a duck.
You cannot outsource sales
when you're starting.
Like, it's not their thing.
Lori, let them go
and steep in their misery!
?Good luck, guys.
?Thank you.
Mason: Wish we could've
came out there with more energy.
We're gonna take what they said,
and, you know,
really try to sell our product
and really market it
and just continue
what we're doing,
'cause we're
on the right path.
