Bonjour, Sharks.
My name is Yve?Car Momperousse.
My name is
Stephane Jean?Baptiste,
and I'm the lucky honey of
this beautiful woman right here.
We live in
sunny Miami, Florida,
and we are
seeking $400,000
for 10% of our company,
Kreyol Essence.
Sharks,
let's get right to it.
Kreyol Essence has the
liquid gold of the Caribbean,
the most nourishing oil
you'll ever want to use
for your hair,
skin, and body.
We're talking about
a rare beauty secret called ??
Shh!
All: Shh!
...lwil maskriti,
also known as
Haitian castor oil.
Let's show you
how we make liquid gold.
After six months of harvesting,
the best castor seeds
are hand?selected
by women artisans.
The seeds are then pressed
using a pestle and mortar.
Then they are roasted
and simmered to perfection.
After the oil
has decanted...
Both: Like a fine wine...
...a mesh is used
to filter out any debris,
leaving you with the raw
and pure Haitian castor oil
we all love!
[ Laughs ]
So, whether it's moisturizing
kinky, curly hair,
promoting thicker lashes
or brows,
or relieving
dry, itchy skin,
we have the most high?performing
natural products for you.
But wait.
Both: There's more!
Kreyol Essence
creates work
for over 300 farmers
and women producers!
[ Cheering ]
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]
So, Sharks,
who's ready to help us build
a billion?dollar business
and share with the world
the true beauty
that Haiti has to offer?
[ Shouts in Haitian Creole ]
Sharks?
[ All shout in Haitian Creole ]
[ Laughter ]
Merci anpil.
Thank you guys so much.
?Nicely done, guys.
?Thank you.
Stephane is now
gonna make sure
that you guys get your own boxes
from the Caribbean
and you get to experience
the liquid gold.
Thank you.
Thank you.
and what you're doing
there...
Jean?Baptiste: Absolutely.
So, our supply chain actually
starts directly out of Haiti.
We actually have our own farm,
about 12 hectares,
where we work with the farmers,
they work for us directly,
but then we also work
with cooperatives.
Cooperatives.
Most farmers live on
less than $1 a day.
We are paying double that
to make sure
that anytime they are
coming with castor seeds,
we give
an above?market price.
Got it. Good.
Okay, so,
what are your sales?
So, we started
the business in 2014.
We did $135,000 in sales.
Okay.
That's not bad.
In 2016, we did $40,000
worth of sales.
Whoa!
What happened?
At the time in 2016,
we were focusing
on actually selling
the castor oil in bulk,
and one of our top clients
actually walked away.
We were still building
the supply chain.
So, you had one client
to represent the majority
of your business?
It was actually
the majority, yes.
So, we decided to pivot.
In 2017, we decided
to go direct?to?consumer,
and from there,
our sales jumped to $327,000.
Greiner: Wow.
O'Leary: Okay.
You went into the retail space.
You switched totally.
2018?
What happened last year?
In 2018,
we did $1 million in sales.
And what's
this year look like?
Wow.
Nice.
This year, we project that
we will close at $2 million.
?Wow.
?Really?
Why will we have
such a significant jump
in revenue at $2 million?
Mm?hmm.
So, the reason that we feel that
we're gonna get to $2 million
is that we just secured
a contract
from the largest beauty retailer
in the country, Ulta.
Yeah, and they're
gonna be launching us
in all 1,200 doors.
Do you have a PO on hand?
We have conversations, yeah.
So, we just finished
the contract,
and then we should be getting
the PO in the next few weeks.
How do people know
what this is?
That's a really good
question, Lori.
I would walk by this
and really not know anything.
And that's why we spend
lots of time making sure
that we educate our retail
partners and their staff.
The other thing is
social media.
So, right now,
we have over 100,000 followers
between all
of our social media outlets,
and our customer base ??
they're showing
before?and?after pictures,
which we have here that we would
love to show you guys.
This actually
helps grow hair?
Yes.
Yes.
Well!
[ Laughter ]
It helps
to promote hair growth.
That's what we always say.
We say "promote hair growth."
So, male pattern baldness
is a major issue,
and we have one
of our customers ??
again, unsolicited ??
who started using
our Haitian castor oil,
and in three months,
you could see,
at the crown of his head,
that his hair started to grow.
And by the way,
what does this one jar cost?
So, the retail price
is about $22 for our scented
and $16 for
our original castor oil.
And it costs you
what to make it?
It cost me $2.50
to make it.
Corcoran: Wow.
Will you be profitable
this year?
We <i>are</i> profitable.
What did you make in 2018
on the $1 million?
We did about $300,000
on that.
John: And do you
have any debt now?
We do have debt.
How much?
We do have
$300,000 in debt.
Thank you.
You could sell
whatever you want to sell.
[ Laughs ]
Extremely persuasive.
But, interestingly,
it's also what I <i>don't</i> like
about the business.
Your business is
too damn dependent
on <i>you</i> selling the product.
That's just not scalable.
I'm out.
Guys, congratulations
with what you've been
able to accomplish.
I just don't see this
being worth $4 million.
I'm out.
[ Smacks lips ]
All right, so, it's just
such a competitive space,
and I don't have enough
expertise in the beauty space.
I'm out.
Daymond,
I'm sorry to hear that.
Greiner: I have a question.
You showed those pictures
of hair growth.
Mm?hmm. Mm?hmm.
Have you done any testing,
any laboratory or trials
or clinicals or anything?
So, clinical testing
is actually part
of the market expanding,
part of what, you know,
we're looking
for the funding for.
But you don't have that.
To me, all it does
is signal a red flag,
because when you put out
anything like that
into the consumer market,
you really have to have
a lot of proof backing that up,
because you don't
have the clinicals.
So I'm sorry ?? I'm out.
But the customers are giving
their experience.
But as a product person
and as a Shark,
there's tons
of fake scam ads.
Absolutely.
And we don't do that.
Absolutely.
And we are all victim
to those fake scam ads
because they'll photoshop
our images
and they'll say
that we back that,
and we don't at all.
So, now I have to be
triply careful.
Well, Lori's red flag
might be this character's
greatest attraction.
[ Laughter ]
So, I look at it and say
what you do have is sales ??
a potential
of $2 million in sales
if this works out
with this retailer.
There's a lot of risk
in this thing.
I don't think the business is
worth $4 million today.
I'm sorry.
I'll give you the $400,000.
I want 37%.
Ohh!
Kevin is
Stephane and Yve's last chance
to make a deal for
their skin?care company,
Kreyol Essence.
I'll give you the $400,000,
I want 37%.
Ohh!
Okay, thank you so much
for that offer.
Would you do $400,000
for 20%?
Never. Never.
Never.
This has risks.
Look,
I'm impressed by you.
Now we're having
a tough?love discussion.
Mm?hmm.
It's about money.
I want to <i>make</i> money.
37% is too rich.
No, it isn't.
Can you meet me
in the middle, at 25%?
No.
No, no, no.
Look, you have
to make a decision.
Mm?hmm.
I'll still have the $400,000
when you walk out that door,
and someone else will
be sitting in front of me.
Yes, and I will still
have that, you know, account
where I'm gonna make
$2 million this year
and go on
to make $5?, $10?,
and make sure
that we get to $100 million.
Because that's what businesses
of our rank and size have done,
and I want you
to be part of that.
I get it.
But that is too high.
But this is your moment.
You have to make a decision.
But 37% is way too high.
There's no way
we could give that much.
Everybody says that.
You know, if you don't like it,
don't take it.
Lots of risk.
That's why they call it
the Shark Tank.
Jean?Baptiste:
What are some of your ideas?
What would you do
to essentially help us?
Oh, now you got to
sell yourself?
I don't have to sell myself.
I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I'm not asking you
to sell yourself.
We're having a conversation.
You know what I do?
We're having a tough?love
conversation.
Tough?love conversation,
Mr. Wonderful.
All right.
I'll justify myself.
I have $400,000.
You don't.
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
Make a decision.
Jean?Baptiste: We recognize
that sales cures all.
Yes.
You know, in 2016,
we were getting ready
to shut down the business
because of having lost that ??
Don't tell me that.
I don't want to hear that.
No, no, for sure.
You're not focusing
on the issue at hand.
$400,000 for 37% ??
yes or no?
Stephane,
you are very emotional.
Can you share why?
[ Sighs ]
That time period was
really tough for us, in 2016.
I mean, even to the point
where we almost just
closed the business down.
It challenged
our relationship,
you know, feeling
as if we sort of...
We failed our community.
...failed our community,
failed ourselves.
It's not just about
the great products.
It's about the mission
of helping
to create a blueprint
for poverty alleviation,
which is a huge problem
around the world.
It's my culture.
It's my identity. It's...
[ Sniffles ]
It's everything that my parents
sacrificed to get us here.
I mean,
we shouldn't be here.
