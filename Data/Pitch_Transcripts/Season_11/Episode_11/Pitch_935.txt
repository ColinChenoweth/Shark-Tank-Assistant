Bonjour, Sharks.
My name is Yve?Car Momperousse.
My name is
Stephane Jean?Baptiste,
Stephane is now
gonna make sure
that you guys get your own boxes
from the Caribbean
Jean?Baptiste:
What are some of your ideas?
What would you do
to essentially help us?
Oh, now you got to
sell yourself?
I don't have to sell myself.
I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I'm not asking you
to sell yourself.
We're having a conversation.
You know what I do?
We're having a tough?love
conversation.
Tough?love conversation,
Mr. Wonderful.
All right.
I'll justify myself.
I have $400,000.
You don't.
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
Make a decision.
Jean?Baptiste: We recognize
that sales cures all.
Yes.
You know, in 2016,
we were getting ready
to shut down the business
because of having lost that ??
Don't tell me that.
I don't want to hear that.
Stephane,
you are very emotional.
Can you share why?
[ Sighs ]
That time period was
really tough for us, in 2016.
I mean, even to the point
where we almost just
closed the business down.
It challenged
our relationship,
you know, feeling
as if we sort of...
We failed our community.
...failed our community,
failed ourselves.
It's not just about
the great products.
It's about the mission
of helping
to create a blueprint
for poverty alleviation,
which is a huge problem
around the world.
It's my culture.
It's my identity. It's...
[ Sniffles ]
It's everything that my parents
sacrificed to get us here.
I mean,
we shouldn't be here.
