Hi. I'm Sofi Overton.
I'm from Vintonville, Arkansas,
and I am seeking $30,000
for 15% equity in my company.
Sharks, I'm 13 years old,
and even though
I'm still in the eighth grade,
I have a PhD in sock?ology.
Heck, I know more
about thread counts
than I do about
the periodic table.
I created a sock <i>for</i> kids
made by <i>this</i> kid
to make life easier
for whatever we're doing.
Introducing
Wise Pocket Products,
an innovative line
of socks and leggings
with pockets in them big enough
for kids' most important items,
like your phone,
so you don't have to worry
about the life?threatening event
of missing a call or text
from your mom anymore.
And I know what you're
probably thinking ??
"There's got to be tons of socks
like this."
Well, I created
a patent?pending sock design
for kids to safely stick
<i>their</i> important items
into <i>our</i> sock pockets.
So, if you're playing soccer...
rock climbing...
[ John laughs ]
or, you know,
spontaneously breaking out
into dance with your friends,
Wise Pocket Products
has you covered.
[ Hip?hop music plays ]
You gonna show us some,
Sofi, in person here?
Yeah, sure.
O'Leary:
Thank you, Sofi.
Nice colors,
though, huh?
Tell us about you,
how you got into this business.
Well, I got into this business
when I was 11,
and my cousin put her phone
in her boot because, you know,
kids' and women's clothing
don't have pockets.
So I tried it, too,
and it was really uncomfortable
because it slipped
down to my ankle,
and I couldn't reach it,
and it was just,
all in all, a bad idea.
And so I asked
around my school
to see if other kids
had this problem, and they did.
And so I came up
with my prototype
where I cut off
the top of another sock
and stuck it inside the sock.
Oh, that's cool.
And then I sewed it
up the sides,
and voilà.
How did you get your money
for the business?
I save everything that I earn,
and I ??
How much money did you actually
put in to make your socks?
I invested $10,000
of my own money.
$10,000? Wow!
$10,000?
I think your parents
overpaid you.
[ Laughing ] Yeah.
No, I had saved $5,000,
and I earned $5,000 more
through business pitches
and competitions like that.
John: Nice!
Oh, wow!
Wow!
Good for you!
Have you been watching
"Shark Tank" very long?
Since I was like
6 years old.
Oh, my gosh. [ Laughs ]
Yeah, make us feel old.
You know, I'd stand up
in the living room and say,
"I'm gonna be on 'Shark Tank.'"
This has been my goal
since before I even
had the idea for the business.
Have you sold any
of these yet?
Overton: Yes.
How much?
A little under $16,000
in sales.
Sofi, let me just tell you,
you're a perfect example
of what every kidpreneur
should do, right?
You got a job,
you saved up some money,
you did all the prototypes
yourself,
then you made
actual products,
then you sold those products ??
$16,000 worth of products.
Now, the only question is,
did you sell those products
profitably?
Tell us what it cost you
to make a sock
and what
you're selling them for.
To make the sock,
it's $5.47.
'Cause that's expensive.
Yes.
It's because
of the process
to make the double welt
for my pocket.
What do you
sell them for?
$15 retail
and $11 wholesale.
What do you want
with the $30,000, Sofi?
What are you
gonna do with it?
Well, my main goal is
to streamline the production,
because right now,
I'm only able to produce
around 100 units per month
because I have ??
Per month?
Uh, yes.
That's horrible.
So, there's other things
out there on the market
that hold in socks.
They have pockets, right?
I do have competition,
although my competitors
only have, like,
small pockets
for keys and stuff.
Well, Sofi, look,
I love what you're doing,
and it's wonderful to see this
at such a young age,
but I don't want a sock company
in my portfolio.
So I'm out.
Thank you.
Cuban: Sofi, I think
it's a great idea.
I'm gonna get some
for my kids.
For me, though, it's not
a great fit as an investment
simply because
this isn't my strength.
I couldn't tell you about
thread counts, you know.
But, I mean, congratulations.
You should be so proud.
But it's not a fit for me,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Cuban:
Congrats, though, Sofi.
Do you feel
that you want to be
running a business right now,
or is it a little stressful
when you're going to school
and all of that?
I mean, going into high school
is stressful on its own,
but with
the Wise Pocket Product,
it's kind of a boost for me.
I feel a confidence boost.
Like, if I can
own a business,
then I can go through school
and turn in that essay.
Good for you, Sofi.
Thank you.
You're already out there
hustling, thinking, creating,
doing it yourself.
So, you've got everything
that it takes
to really be
a great entrepreneur.
And Daymond and I
want to help you.
Overton: Yeah.
So...
...what do you think,
Lori?
We'll do the $30,000.
We'll be 1/3 partner.
Our goal is to try to find
somebody to license it.
And then,
when we get to that point,
we'll figure out
what the licensing deal is.
Do you want to take the $30,000
and give up 1/3 of your company?
You got to make a decision.
Yes or no?
Yeah, Sofi!
Okay.
Let's hear it.
Um...
$35,000 for...
25%.
Wow!
Whoo! Ooh!
[ Laughs ]
Corcoran: Well, well, well.
Sofi's got
negotiating skills!
Greiner: So you're going up...
She had a little switchblade
in her sock on that one, huh?
25%?
Congratulations, Sofi.
Well done.
Overton: Thank you.
