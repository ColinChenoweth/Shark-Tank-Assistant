Hi. I'm Sofi Overton.
I'm from Vintonville, Arkansas,
You gonna show us some,
Sofi, in person here?
Yeah, sure.
O'Leary:
Thank you, Sofi.
Nice colors,
though, huh?
Tell us about you,
how you got into this business.
Well, I got into this business
when I was 11,
Overton: Yes.
How much?
A little under $16,000
in sales.
Sofi, let me just tell you,
you're a perfect example
of what every kidpreneur
should do, right?
You got a job,
you saved up some money,
you did all the prototypes
yourself,
then you made
actual products,
then you sold those products ??
$16,000 worth of products.
Now, the only question is,
did you sell those products
profitably?
Tell us what it cost you
to make a sock
What do you want
with the $30,000, Sofi?
What are you
gonna do with it?
Well, my main goal is
to streamline the production,
because right now,
I'm only able to produce
around 100 units per month
because I have ??
Per month?
Uh, yes.
That's horrible.
So, there's other things
out there on the market
that hold in socks.
They have pockets, right?
I do have competition,
although my competitors
only have, like,
Well, Sofi, look,
I love what you're doing,
Cuban: Sofi, I think
it's a great idea.
I'm gonna get some
for my kids.
For me, though, it's not
a great fit as an investment
simply because
this isn't my strength.
I couldn't tell you about
thread counts, you know.
But, I mean, congratulations.
You should be so proud.
But it's not a fit for me,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Cuban:
Congrats, though, Sofi.
Do you feel
that you want to be
running a business right now,
or is it a little stressful
Good for you, Sofi.
Thank you.
You're already out there
hustling, thinking, creating,
doing it yourself.
So, you've got everything
that it takes
to really be
a great entrepreneur.
Overton: Yeah.
So...
...what do you think,
Lori?
We'll do the $30,000.
We'll be 1/3 partner.
Our goal is to try to find
somebody to license it.
Yeah, Sofi!
Okay.
Let's hear it.
Um...
$35,000 for...
25%.
Wow!
Whoo! Ooh!
[ Laughs ]
Corcoran: Well, well, well.
Sofi's got
negotiating skills!
Greiner: So you're going up...
She had a little switchblade
in her sock on that one, huh?
25%?
Congratulations, Sofi.
Well done.
Overton: Thank you.
