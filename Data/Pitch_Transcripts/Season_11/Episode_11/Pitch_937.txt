Hello, Sharks. I'm Jenn.
And I'm Ryan.
We are the founders of LoveSync
from Cleveland, Ohio.
We're seeking $100,000
for 10% of our company.
Sharks, imagine this.
You're out on a romantic date
with your significant other.
Great food,
a fine bottle
of O'Leary Merlot,
[ Laughter ]
and there are
no distractions
from enjoying
each other's company.
I think we all know
that nights like this
usually finish
with a happy end.
But what about
those everyday nights
when life gets in the way
and sexy times often becomes
a take?it or leave?it
proposition?
Like tonight.
He could be down for
a little dance in the sheets,
but he assumes that she is
exhausted from a stressful day,
lets the moment pass.
Little does he know,
she'd be up for
a quick bed boogie to unwind,
but she <i>is</i> tired,
and she figures
it's gonna take more energy
than she's got tonight
to distract him
away from his work.
The reality is,
these types of situations
play out more often
than people realize.
What if there was a way
we could know
our partner's subtle desires
when they're not
always made obvious?
Now there is.
The LoveSync button lets
you and your partner know
when your moods
are matched,
turning missed opportunities
into more romance.
It works like this.
Simply place a button
at each nightstand
and plug in the power.
On those routine evenings
where she's feeling
a little frisky,
she discreetly
taps her button.
If she's the only one
who taps...
[ Laughs ]
...her partner
never knows.
She enjoys her sleep.
But...
he's also a tad randy.
He'll discreetly
tap <i>his</i> button.
The LoveSync technology
recognizes
they're both privately thinking
the same thing.
It lets them know
by emitting a swirling glow
from the buttons.
They can now make their moves
with confidence...
[ Laughter ]
...knowing their partner's
good to go.
[ Laughter ]
With LoveSync, couples' desires
are fulfilled more frequently,
leading to
a happier relationship.
Isn't it time for those of us
already in relationships
to have a little tech
to help us hook up more?
So, Sharks, who of you
want to get in bed with us
and help get the world
LoveSynced?
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Nice.
Not what I was expecting.
We're gonna go ahead
and excuse our couple
for a little private time.
[ Laughs ]
Barbara, Kevin,
go test it.
[ Laughter ]
So, why did you
come up with this?
One night, I was laying there
on the fence, like,
"If I knew it wasn't gonna be
a lot of work tonight,
if she's, like, down,
ready to go,"
I'm like,
"I'd go for it."
[ Chuckles ] God.
And I don't know ??
that's when it struck,
and it was just
one of those ideas.
So, Jenn...
[ Chuckles ]
what do you think of this?
Once I got it,
it was like a light?bulb moment.
After using the buttons now
for several months,
it's a gadget that
we don't want to get rid of.
We've gotten a lot of feedback
from our backers
who have said
they didn't even realize
the opportunities
that they were missing
until they got
the button.
What are your sales?
We made $25,000
on Kickstarter.
And that's how many units?
That was 400 units.
Have you fulfilled
all the orders on Kickstarter?
Yes. Yes.
Yes.
What do you sell it for?
Around $60.
Wow.
That's not bad.
People pay a lot more
for a dozen roses
to get the same thing.
[ Greiner laughs ]
What do they cost to make?
So, at our first demo queue
of 1,000 units, we're at $22.
Oh, wow.
That'll go down
to $14 or less.
Greiner: Share with us
your background,
because is this
your full?time job?
No.
No.
So, I, um...
I'm a chief product engineer.
I work on consumer robotics ??
actually, robotic lawn mowers.
I am
the operations manager
for a marriage and family
counseling practice.
Well, that would make sense,
you know?
Mm?hmm.
We know that the future in this
is with mobile.
We are currently developing
a mobile app.
I'm having a hard time
with the basic premise.
I mean, what about you
two guys? Why don't you
just talk to each other?
"Look, I want some sex.
You in or out?"
We do,
but here's the problem.
LoveSync is going to make
communicating romantically
easier
and more efficient.
That's what technology
has done for us
in all other aspects
of our lives.
What I was sitting here thinking
was the exact opposite.
Yeah.
So many people complain today
that, actually,
technology and people
being on their phones
and not communicating
has become, like, overpowering
and actually a <i>bad</i> thing.
I don't see this
as sexy or romantic.
I see it
as technology going too far ??
like, to a place
where I feel like
just communicating is
so much more important.
I'm so sorry.
I don't believe in this.
So ??
I'm out.
So, it is not
a replacement.
There is some science
about this.
Our sexual desire ranges
on a spectrum,
from ice?cold,
like, "It's just not happening
right now," right,
to red?hot,
"I'm gonna let you know
what I'm thinking.
I'm gonna communicate."
You're gonna get
your point across,
and you're communicating.
Do that.
Are you saying the motivation
is the fear of rejection?
Yeah.
So, this is why the app ??
This is why we are pivoting
the hardware ??
I hate the app idea.
There are millions of apps
sitting on platforms
that never get used.
If you had the app working
right now
and you put it out there...
Do any of them
get you more sex?
...you would have to get
customers acquired.
That would require capital
to figure out,
"What's my customer
acquisition cost?"
whether it's this button
or whether it's an app.
And, you know,
I think there's
a fair amount of skepticism
up here about this,
to be honest with you.
I think it would work, right,
for enough people.
But this is a business.
You haven't said anything at all
about the business,
other than
you've done a Kickstarter,
but that doesn't tell me
you have anything to invest in.
Here's the business.
So, once we launch
the app,
we will start growing
our user base ??
slowly at first,
to start to get feedback,
and ?? and, uh...
Ryan, that's not an answer,
right?
You're stumbling
all over it.
So, then it's gonna be
a subscription model because...
O'Leary: This is the app now?
...obviously,
people are skeptical about this.
This is not the buttons?
Now we're on the app?
That's right.
Like I said, the app is
the future of this,
and I will tell you
why that is.
[ Groans ]
So, anybody out there
who's thinking, like,
"That's a dumb idea" ??
What happened
to the button?
There's always
a piece of ??
We're not gonna sell
any buttons?
Let's try. It could be fun.
Let's see what happens.
Ryan,
you're all over the map!
You know, Ryan ??
So ??
Ryan ?? Ryan, you're making
things more confusing.
Okay.
Ryan, I'm out.
I just can't see you getting
from point "A" to point "B."
I don't think you're organized
enough to make this work.
John:
So, here's my thought on it.
My favorite part
of my relationship with my wife
is talking crap all day about
all the things I'm gonna do,
and then I just fall asleep ??
I don't even do anything.
And I've heard it.
He's truthful.
But that's the romantic part,
right?
You know,
she knows that I love her,
she knows
that I'm attracted by her,
and I'm like, "Oh,
I'm?a do this, I'm?a do this,"
and she's like, "Sure, buddy.
You're not doing anything."
And that's the beautiful
part about it.
So, I think it's a little
too early right now for me.
I'm out.
Mark, I'd like to ??
Corcoran:
I want to give this a shot
if I could, okay?
The price point is too high,
the cost to make it is too high,
but here's the real problem
with your business plan.
It's Ryan.
And I'm gonna tell you, Ryan,
why you're a problem.
You don't listen.
You're so in love
with your idea
that you're tripping
over yourself
to express your love
again and again,
and you really haven't
adequately answered
any objection
that has been raised here.
You jump?skipped
onto your new app.
That's a problem.
Because the entrepreneurs
that don't listen never make it.
I don't care what kind of
product they have in their hand.
And so that is
the scariest thing in the world
and the scariest place in
the world for me to put money.
So, sadly, as much as I actually
like what you've done here,
I'm out for that reason.
O'Leary: Guys, I'm sorry.
You did a poor job
presenting.
I'm out.
Jenn:
We are so excited
about this product
and this technology
and all the ideas
that we have for it.
I think we let that
get the best of us,
and we weren't effective enough
in communicating
the plan that we actually have
to do that.
