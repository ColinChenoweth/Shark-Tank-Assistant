Hey, Sharks.
My name is Melissa Bartow.
I'm from New York City,
and I'm seeking $100,000
for 20% of my company,
Wanna Date?
I had my first date just
three years ago during college,
and let me tell you, I've had
a <i>lot</i> of dates ever since.
At least a few every day.
Sometimes even more.
Sharks, I love dates so much
that I created...
[ Greiner laughs ]
...Wanna Date?
Corcoran: Ohh!
A line of date?based spreads
that are natural, vegan,
and ?? get this ??
they're totally allergen?free.
You see, Sharks,
dates are
my absolute favorite fruit.
These tasty little things
satisfy all my cravings,
power me
through my workout...
Damn.
Nice.
...and keep me energized
all day long.
I love dates so much
that I want to just spread them
on everything.
And the best part is
that my date spreads
come with all of
your favorite flavors ??
chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon,
and let's not forget
pumpkin spice,
and at just 30 calories
per serving,
Wanna Date? is
the perfect go?to alternative
for any nut, butter,
or syrup out there.
So, Sharks,
no more cheating on your diets.
What do you all say?
Wanna Date?
John: Wanna Date?
Greiner:
We'd love to try it.
Yes!
I know you could all use
a little more love
in your lives, so samples!
Absolutely.
Thank you, Melissa.
Appreciate it.
Bartow: You are welcome.
God. There's enough food
to last a lifetime.
Greiner: Wow. Oh, yum.
Corcoran: What is this ??
yogurt base?
That is an acai bowl
with mixed berries on top
and chocolate date spread
drizzled.
Next to that
is a bowl of overnight oats
sweetened only with
vanilla Wanna Date?,
a stack of pumpkin spice
Wanna Date? pancakes,
and then a date butter
and banana sandwich
with cinnamon Wanna Date?
and a side
of cinnamon date spread bacon.
So delicious.
I like them,
but it tastes so sweet.
Are you sure it's only
30 calories per serving?
Dates typically have
a lot of calories.
Yes.
So, if you think about it,
most jams and jellies
are actually 40 or 50,
nut butters are actually
80 to 90 calories.
Plus, we don't add any oils.
We mix with water.
O'Leary: Here's a fact, Melissa,
you may not know.
The date fruit,
along with camel milk,
can sustain a human being
indefinitely.
That's how many Bedouins
centuries ago
lived in the desert.
Greiner: How do you
know this story?
Corcoran:
Remarkable you know that.
Because I know.
Camel milk?
What people don't understand
about the date,
it's one of the healthiest
fruits on Earth,
and, actually,
it's lower cal than many fruits.
No, the dates
are a superfood.
I tell everyone dates are
the next, like, avocados...
It <i>is</i> a superfood.
...or cauliflower
in terms of food trends.
Ah, super, schmuper.
They're delicious
but so under?utilized.
Tell us about your sales
and how you're selling them.
So, it's been about 10 months.
To date, I've sold ??
"To <i>date."</i> [ Chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]
...just under $31,000.
10% of that's been
through my website,
and then
35% is through events.
I go to Christmas markets
around New York City
on the weekends,
vegan fairs.
And 55% is wholesale.
Melissa, tell us about you.
Originally, I'm from
just northwest Georgia,
a town called Kennesaw,
and I just graduated from NYU,
actually, three weeks ago.
Cuban: Congrats.
Are you working on this
100% of the time?
Yes.
Because $31,000 in sales,
living in New York City...
How do you support yourself?
My dad supports me still.
So, how much does
one jar cost you to make?
Right now,
it costs me $2.40 to make,
Cuban: Ooh.
with the label and all.
That's a lot.
I sell it ?? Excuse me?
That's a lot.
Yes.
I can get costs down, though,
to about $1.70 or $1.80.
And what do you sell it for?
On my website, for $12.
Greiner: $12?
Yes.
And people are willing
to pay $12 a jar?
Yes. I've actually
never had anyone complain
about $12 per jar.
Really?
Yeah.
Did you do any type
of market research, though,
where you would, like,
reach out to people
and ask them,
"Would you buy this?
How often would you use it?" ??
things like that.
Um...not formally.
But also, I've learned people
have no idea what they do want.
You know?
Amen.
The challenge with that is,
you're there, right?
And you're educating them,
right?
When I first started,
I used to stand out
on 125th Street in Harlem,
right outside the Apollo
when the Apollo Theater let out,
and I got
really good responses.
They told me what they thought
about my T?shirts <i>and</i> my mama.
Everything.
[ Laughter ]
But then, when I went
to put it in stores,
it didn't move.
When nobody was there
to tell the story,
I got stuck.
So, I think
it's a crowded market
that I know nothing about,
and I think it's gonna
be a challenge, really,
just educating people
on how badly they need this.
So I'm out.
Okay.
I feel like
it's very early
for us to know
if people want dates or not.
It was delicious.
I wish you good luck...
Can I ??
...but I'm gonna go out.
Well, I hope
you change your mind.
I'm gonna make dates
mainstream
the same way avocados
and cauliflower ?? everything.
That's why I chose flavors
to lower the inhibitions
of customers who have
never had dates, heard of dates,
don't know
the health benefits.
But, Melissa, why didn't you do
just a plain flavor
for people
who like dates?
So, I do have, actually ??
I just developed a plain flavor.
Well, why the flavors at all
to start?
If you're gonna turn dates
into a superfood,
you got to let
the star of the show
be the star of the show.
So, where are you going
with this, Mark?
I'm disappointed
in some respects.
of Melissa's date butter
company, Wanna Date?
The plain flavor's coming.
I know,
but would you do <i>just</i> that?
And abandon all the flavors?
For right now, yeah.
Because if you want
to make it a superfood,
make it
the star of the show.
Here's where, for me,
it falls apart.
When I was starting
my business,
if I didn't make a deal
within two weeks, I was dead.
I needed to live somewhere
and eat.
What is in your way,
I believe,
is that your father
is helping you,
because succeeding is an <i>option,</i>
versus a necessity.
And I found that the people
that really succeed
have a real necessity.
They have to do it
or the sky's gonna fall in.
With the absence of that,
I can't believe it enough
to put my money in,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
You know what, Melissa,
I don't agree.
I understand
from an investment perspective.
There <i>is</i> value when someone's
back is against the wall.
We've all faced it, right?
But that's like saying,
if Barbara's right,
that means none of our kids can
ever do anything on their own,
and I can't ??
I refuse to believe that.
Like, I hate
asking him for money,
and this is the first time
I've ever had to.
[ Sniffles ] And I'm gonna
pay him every single penny back.
That's why I work hard
every day.
Melissa, my problem
with your deal is...
it's too early to be worth
half a million bucks.
There's a lot
that's going to happen
before you actually get scale.
And I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Thank you, Mark!
O'Leary: Smart move, Melissa.
Smart move.
Greiner: Congratulations.
I appreciate it.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
O'Leary: Smart move.
Thank you, everyone.
Greiner: Congratulations.
?Good luck.
?We'll talk soon.
