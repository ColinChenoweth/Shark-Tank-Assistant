Hey, Sharks.
My name is Melissa Bartow.
Thank you, Melissa.
Appreciate it.
Bartow: You are welcome.
God. There's enough food
to last a lifetime.
Greiner: Wow. Oh, yum.
Corcoran: What is this ??
yogurt base?
That is an acai bowl
with mixed berries on top
O'Leary: Here's a fact, Melissa,
you may not know.
The date fruit,
along with camel milk,
can sustain a human being
indefinitely.
That's how many Bedouins
centuries ago
lived in the desert.
Greiner: How do you
know this story?
Corcoran:
Remarkable you know that.
Because I know.
Camel milk?
Melissa, tell us about you.
Originally, I'm from
just northwest Georgia,
a town called Kennesaw,
But, Melissa, why didn't you do
just a plain flavor
for people
who like dates?
So, I do have, actually ??
I just developed a plain flavor.
Well, why the flavors at all
to start?
If you're gonna turn dates
into a superfood,
you got to let
the star of the show
be the star of the show.
So, where are you going
with this, Mark?
I'm disappointed
in some respects.
of Melissa's date butter
company, Wanna Date?
The plain flavor's coming.
I know,
but would you do <i>just</i> that?
You know what, Melissa,
I don't agree.
Melissa, my problem
with your deal is...
it's too early to be worth
half a million bucks.
There's a lot
that's going to happen
before you actually get scale.
Thank you, Mark!
O'Leary: Smart move, Melissa.
Smart move.
Greiner: Congratulations.
I appreciate it.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
O'Leary: Smart move.
Thank you, everyone.
Greiner: Congratulations.
?Good luck.
?We'll talk soon.
