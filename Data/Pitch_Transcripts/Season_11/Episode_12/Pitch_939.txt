Hello, Sharks.
My name is Dustin Finkel,
Corcoran:
I'm good, Dustin.
[ Laughter ]
Hello, Mark. How are you?
Hello. I'm good,
'cause I'm a growing boy.
Mmm.
Take all of them.
I got cases after cases
for you.
No doubt.
All we are is literally sorghum
with no fillers.
Dustin,
I believe your real gift
is you're one hell
of a salesman.
Dustin, let me jump in.
Look.
Yeah.
You are a good salesperson,
but you oversell.
You didn't talk about what your
challenges were going to be.
?Dustin, thank you very much.
?Thank you. Thank you.
Cuban: Good luck.
Congratulations, Dustin.
Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
?Good luck, Dustin.
?Take care.
?Great job.
He'll be fine.
He's rock?solid.
Finkel: We didn't get a deal,
but the Sharks
loved the product,
