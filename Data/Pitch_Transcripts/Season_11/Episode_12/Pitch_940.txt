Hello, Sharks.
My name is Alex Bayer.
How much money have you put
into the business, Alex?
Yeah, about $1.3 million.
Wow!
That's a lot
of money, yeah.
Oh, not personally. No, no.
Oh, okay.
I myself put $150,000 in.
Alex,
does that discourage you,
hearing that
from a guy in the business?
Not at all.
Not at all.
There's plenty of
refrigerated beverages
Alex, I invested in
two different soda companies
about three years apart.
in Alex's coconut smoothie
company, Genius Juice.
I swore to myself
I would never, ever invest
in any kind of
a beverage company again.
All right?
But I love that this damn thing
is so delicious.
This coconut is the best
I've ever had.
Nothing else like it.
It's creamy, delicious.
I swear I'm drinking
1,000 calories,
but it's 100 calories.
That's great, all right?
I love you, Alex.
Barbara, I can do $250,000
for 11%.
You're not interested in debt,
I take it?
No, I'm not interested
in debt.
Alex, you got
two great Sharks in that.
Oh.
Greiner:
Really delicious.
