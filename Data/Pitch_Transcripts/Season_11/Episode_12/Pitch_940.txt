Hello, Sharks.
My name is Dustin Finkel,
and I'm the CEO and founder
of Ancient inGRAINed ??
Oh, no,
not these guys again.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Stand back, Sharks.
I'll handle this.
?Wow.
?Oh, my Lord.
Okay, player.
[ Laughs ]
Gluten, not this time!
Yeah!
Allergens,
get out of here.
Mm,
didn't go that far.
Empty calories?
Ha!
Nice try.
GMOs? Never!
Whew.
?Whew!
?Wow. Oh.
?That's fantastic.
I'm sorry about that, Sharks.
I have made it my life's mission
to defeat bad guys like that,
and I've done what I can,
but I need your help.
I'm here today
asking for $350,000,
and in exchange,
I'm willing to offer 5%...
Ooh.
...of the strongest weapon
we have ??
Ka?Pop! Ancient Grain pop chips
powered by sorghum!
Sorghum is an ancient grain
unadulterated since the times
of ancient Egypt.
It remains in its original form,
having never been altered
in any way.
It is loaded with
whole?grain fiber,
protein, antioxidants,
and minerals ??
all you need to make
our delicious flavors,
like our number?one?selling
rosemary garlic,
our salt and vinegar...
?[ Chuckles ]
?...vegan cheddar...
?[ Laughs ]
?...and olive oil and sea salt.
We are vegan, non?GMO,
gluten?free, and allergen?free,
but we're not taste?free.
Sharks, now with
our powers combined,
we can make Ka?Pop!
a true snacking superhero!
I will now pass out samples.
?Good job.
?Very good.
?Wow.
?Thank you.
?Okay.
?Here we go.
So, if you want to take
one of those.
One of these?
We have four flavors ??
vegan cheddar...
These two.
I'll take these two.
...salt and vinegar.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
?I'll go cheddar and garlic.
?Fantastic.
Mr. Wonderful, how are you?
Thank you, thank you.
Barbara, how are you?
Corcoran:
I'm good, Dustin.
[ Laughter ]
Hello, Mark. How are you?
Hello. I'm good,
'cause I'm a growing boy.
Mmm.
Take all of them.
I got cases after cases
for you.
No doubt.
All we are is literally sorghum
with no fillers.
We air?pop it, add cold?pressed
oil and seasoning ??
nothing else.
So, I can tell you a little bit
about my background.
I've spent 13 years
in the food industry.
Before that, I was an investment
banker at Goldman Sachs.
I went to General Mills,
where I launched
the first nationwide
gluten?free product ever.
I've worked on numerous brands,
but this is my first start?up.
And I did this because I wanted
authentically healthy snacks
that deliver
authentic nutrition,
and that's what
you're eating here today.
O'Leary:
I want to tell you something.
I've tried a lot of this GMO,
no carb, blah?da,
yada, yada, yada.
This is good.
?Very good.
?Thank you very, very much.
?It is good.
?Really good.
?Tasty.
?Great product.
Thank you so much,
Rohan.
It's gonna be fun 'cause
it's one of the first times
in "Shark Tank" history
where we have an actual
investment banker
at a crazy valuation.
[ Laughter ]
Oza: This is
going to be great.
?Let's have some fun.
?How do you know it's crazy?
This is a great valuation.
You're in my wheelhouse,
buddy.
Explain why you're worth
$7 million.
So, our sales were $150,000
as we just got going last year.
This year, we're on pace
to do about $1.2 million.
Wow.
In the last ??
Any profits?
I'll come back to profits
in a second.
I don't like that answer.
Well, $50,000
three months ago,
$60,000, $70,000,
we're on pace to do
$70,000?plus this month.
The reality in the food space,
unfortunately,
is it's really
a gross?margin game.
So, we are doing outstanding
on a gross?margin front.
We're high 40s, low 50s
on our gross margin.
Is that after trade spend?
That's after trade spend.
Yeah.
I have game?changer
type of investors.
So, I have the ex?head
of Whole Foods grocery,
I have the founder
of Boulder Brands,
the founder of
Pacific Foods.
They're investors
in my company.
?Invested.
?Oh, investors? Wow.
One of the reasons that I've
been so successful so far ??
we're 1,000 doors,
100% selling rate ??
is they open the door.
You put me in front of someone,
I will sell them.
How much have
you put in personally,
and how much have you taken
in investment?
So, I initially put in
$50,000 to start.
What about investors?
So, investors,
my first pre?revenue round
took on $943,000,
including my money.
?Wow.
?Wow.
That's a lot to take in.
That's your first
pre?revenue round.
It was not expected.
I was going out there,
selling hard, hustling.
It was the hardest thing I've
ever done was pre?revenue raise.
Got that. No, okay,
so let's put that aside,
'cause you're a grinder,
we know it...
Yep. Yep.
...you're smart,
you've been there.
Right.
How much more
have you taken in,
and how much of the company
do you own right now?
So, I just started
another round.
Most of my first?round people
want to come back in,
which is a great sign.
That's good.
We have some
Forbes 400 people
that are also interested in
coming in on this round.
Good for you.
At this point,
I still have 100%
'cause they're all
convertible notes.
Yeah, but you know
what I'm saying.
And so after
the first round, 67%.
How much are you trying
to raise in total?
I am trying to raise
about $1 million.
Okay.
What you're really here for
is strictly cash?
?No, not at all.
?Nah.
What else?
Not at all.
I have plenty of cash,
actually,
and I have plenty of interest
from this round.
I'd like to know
what's at stake here for you
if you don't get a deal.
I believe what ??
being here,
partnering with you guys,
adds fuel to the fire
in no other way I can get
from anybody else.
This is an incredible
opportunity.
Sincerely, since the day
the show came on air,
if you ask my wife,
my family,
this has been
literally my dream.
I was standing back,
getting ready for this,
and mind?blown
that this was happening.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Good for you.
?That's amazing.
?This has literally
been my dream.
I never had my own idea,
and then I had a great idea,
and I came here.
Oza: What's to stop Popchips ??
great brand name,
well?known ??
saying, "Hey, we're gonna launch
an ancient grain line"?
This is about perseverance
and execution
in the branding
and food space.
Every single brand
I've ever worked on,
I've had success on.
I haven't had
one failure to date.
I'm gonna do
the same thing here.
Dustin,
I believe your real gift
is you're one hell
of a salesman.
Thank you.
And you look the part.
You look like you're
an ancient grain man, you know?
Okay.
[ Laughs ]
So I like
the whole imaging, okay?
Thank you.
But there's not a thing I feel
I could do for this business.
And I like to feel like
I make a difference
in anything I step into.
So, my congratulations,
but I'm out.
I'm very, very sorry
to hear that.
You were one of the Sharks
who I think
could actually add a lot of
value to my business.
Dustin, let me jump in.
Look.
Yeah.
You are a good salesperson,
but you oversell.
You didn't talk about what your
challenges were going to be.
Right? Just sometimes,
you got to stop selling and say,
"Look, here's where
you can help me,"
because that's where
true confidence comes through.
Seems like a great product,
but for those reasons, I'm out.
Appreciate the feedback.
It's good feedback. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I would hire you,
by the way.
I kind of disagree
a little bit
with my fellow Sharks
on the other end.
Uh...
I'll take you up on that
one day.
If this thing doesn't pan out,
just come to me.
I'm telling you,
I would put you in
to run any one
of my companies.
So, you know, obviously,
I'm in the snack business.
It's not an easy business.
So, my problem is,
you're very early.
Margins are good,
but this industry
has crushing trade spend
that will just
jam your margins down.
And as you scale up,
you're gonna have to manpower
up, et cetera, et cetera.
And while I like you
and I'll take you anywhere,
I'm concerned
the journey is too arduous.
So, unfortunately, I'm out.
That's very sad
to hear.
Greiner: I like the product.
I am your market.
The thing is,
I kind of like jumping in
where I know that I can
really help people,
and I think you've got a lot
of people with you
that can do that.
So, I'm sorry, I'm out.
That's crushing.
You've heard all the other
Sharks talk about the risks.
I get all that.
I don't have ancient grains
in my portfolio right now.
[ Laughter ]
So, it's interesting.
But there's risk
and there's reward, all right?
Of course.
5%, I don't even
get out of bed for,
because I know with certainty
I have to participate
in every round after that
to keep this tiny position,
regardless of
what the valuation is.
The only way I would do this
is turn back time.
I'd give you the $350,000,
I want 17.5%.
That's a $2 million
valuation.
'Cause otherwise, I'm just gonna
get diluted into oblivion
because you're gonna have to
raise so much money.
The bottom?line value
that we've talked about
as a company for this round
has been $5 million
from a cap perspective.
I don't want to screw you up
on that,
but when you say
you have a Shark
and it's Mr. Wonderful,
there's Sharks,
and then there's...
[Vocalizes]
Mr. Wonderful.
What about $500,000
for 10%?
No. No.
You know, you're stuck
at that $5 million. I get it.
I understand your problem.
Our universes are not aligned.
I'm a superhero, too,
and we're flying around
different planets.
[ Laughter ]
"I'm a superhero."
Mr. Wonderful!
Tell you what,
I'll arm?wrestle you
for my valuation,
and we'll see who wins.
I think you'd win.
Greiner:
Oh, go for it! Do it!
It's gonna be heartbreaking
to walk out of here
without something.
Dustin, we are miles apart,
and there's no middle ground.
That's the problem.
The lowest I think I can go
from a valuation,
to be fair and equitable
to everyone, is $4 million.
I don't think I can go
lower than that.
It's 100% more than
what I'm willing to pay.
Yep.
Sometimes the valuation gap
is too large.
I'm a Shark.
You are.
I do Shark deals.
So do I ??
except now, I guess.
[ Laughter ]
?Dustin.
?And you will.
You know what?
You will.
?Dustin, thank you very much.
?Thank you. Thank you.
Cuban: Good luck.
Congratulations, Dustin.
Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
?Good luck, Dustin.
?Take care.
?Great job.
He'll be fine.
He's rock?solid.
Finkel: We didn't get a deal,
but the Sharks
loved the product,
and that's a home run
in my book.
We're gonna keep going,
and we're gonna show everyone
what Ka?Pop! can be,
and we're gonna be everywhere
you want a great, healthy,
salty snack.
