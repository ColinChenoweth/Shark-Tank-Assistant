Hello, Sharks.
My name is Alex Bayer.
I'm the founder and CEO
of Genius Juice.
We are seeking $250,000
in exchange for 7% equity.
Instead of talking
about our product,
we're gonna sing about it.
And here we go.

? Coconut ?
? Coconut ?
? Coconut smoothie ?
? Coconut smoothie ?
? Whole coconut blended up ?
? So creamy ?
? Whole coconut in a drink ?
It's amazing!
? Everything but the shell ?
? It's pure genius ?
Genius Juice
is the first product
to include whole coconut
in every bottle.
Unlike regular coconut water,
we freshly crack open
organic young Thai coconut
and blend together the coconut
water and the coconut meat.
It's from tree to bottle
within five hours or less.
It's truly pure genius.
So, who wants to join us
on our genius journey?
? It's pure genius ?
[ Lori and Barbara laugh ]
Oza: Nice job!
?Yay! Bravo! Bravo!
?Bravo! Marvelous!
Thank you.
Thank goodness
for their voices.
[ Laughter ]
Can I get you guys
some samples?
There you go.
This is the three flavors ??
original ??
Take one of each.
Okay.
One of each?
Perfect.
Yep, there you go.
Thank you.
Lori, you can take the ones
on your right.
Oh, thank you so much.
And also
there are straws here.
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you so much.
Barbara.
I think I can guess
what's next.
So, there's three flavors.
The green one
is the original,
and then turmeric,
and also coffee.
All of them have
whole coconut in it ??
coconut water
and coconut meat.
This is
a full coconut in here?
Yeah, there's a full coconut
in every bottle.
How many calories
is this thing?
It's about 100 calories
per bottle.
Any added sugar?
No added sugars.
Anything added at all?
No, there's no added ??
natural flavors.
No gums, no junk.
The original,
which is the green one,
that's coconut water,
coconut meat.
So delicious.
Thank you.
So creamy and delicious.
Yeah, once you get in
the mind?set of a smoothie
and you're drinking
a smoothie,
then it's good.
It can be
a meal replacement.
And also the benefits of having
not only just coconut water,
which is potassium
and electrolytes,
but having
the coconut meat
is hitting on a lot
of great trends.
And it's only
100 calories?
100 calories, yeah.
I could eat this for lunch.
It's only 100 calories.
Me, too.
What do you sell each bottle
of coconut water for?
The retail price.
And what does it cost to make?
Yeah, so the coconut smoothie,
we sell at retail
between $4.99 and $5.99.
Mm?hmm.
That's in the retail store.
Our cost to make it is $1.87.
And you have a co?packer that's
doing this coconut blending?
Yeah, what's amazing is we have
a manufacturing partner
that is in Thailand
at the source
about two miles from
where the coconuts grow.
They source it at its peak
in nutrition and freshness,
they cut open the coconuts,
they extract the water
and the meat,
and they blend it
and bottle it.
And what preservative
do you have in it
so it makes it
across the ocean?
So, there's no preservative.
It's refrigerated
transportation?
It's actually frozen.
Oh, frozen.
So, we pasteurize it,
and when it's ready
to go to the stores,
we thaw it,
and it goes right to the stores.
That makes it
really tough,
'cause you got to get
refrigeration space.
Okay, well, with distribution,
we are with two of the largest
natural distributors
in the country.
Uh, we are currently
in about 1,100 stores.
Our distribution strategy
is, uh ??
One of my mentors told me
"Inch wide, mile deep."
It's not about going into
a ton of stores.
Totally agree with you.
It's about going in the stores
where your product
will actually sell best
and pulling velocity.
What are you selling
in those 1,100 stores?
How much?
Last year,
we did $367,000...
Yeah.
...total.
This year, uh, so far,
halfway into the year,
we're at $320,000.
So, you're probably
gonna double it,
you think, potentially.
I think we're gonna triple it
because we're launching also
in 400 new locations
the end of next month,
and that's Vons and Pavilions
and Albertsons.
On the stores that
you've already sold to,
are they constantly
reordering?
Yeah. Yeah, we get reorders
every single week.
Assuming you're going to triple,
let's call it a millsky.
You're gonna do
a million bucks this year.
?A millsky.
?A millsky. [ Laughs ]
Okay, how much are you gonna
make on the millsky?
How much are you gonna <i>lose</i>
on the millsky?
So, we are not gonna be
net profitable
until about $2.5 million.
2.5 millskies.
Yeah, that's gonna be
our break?even point.
How do I give this a valuation
of $3.5 million?
'Cause you're saying
$250,000 for 7%,
imputes a $3.5 million
valuation.
We are projecting to do
$6 million next year.
So, I'm gonna
make an assumption
you have a little flexibility
on valuation, right?
There is some flexibility.
I thought so.
Yeah, 'cause I would love
to partner up.
There should be
a lot of flexibility.
Corcoran: I would make
the assumption that you're gonna
need a lot more money
than $250,000.
Exactly.
Yeah, the $250,000
is going to be enough money
to get to a series A raise.
However, I'm definitely open
if there is a larger investment
where we can get there together.
I'm all ears.
Does anybody else do
a coconut smoothie?
No one else actually does this.
How much money have you put
into the business, Alex?
Yeah, about $1.3 million.
Wow!
That's a lot
of money, yeah.
Oh, not personally. No, no.
Oh, okay.
I myself put $150,000 in.
?Okay.
?And what do you own
in the business
at this point?
So, myself and a family member,
we own about 87%.
Ah.
Have you been delisted
with any retailers?
About three years ago,
we were at a co?packer
here in Los Angeles,
and we were in about 450 stores
at that time.
And they were ??
It was very abusive.
They were upcharging us,
they were moving us around.
We were forced to leave.
So we had no one
to make our product.
We lost all our shelf space
in the 450 stores.
So, I was able to arrange a deal
with our manufacturing partners.
Before, they were just
supplying us coconuts.
They not only invested in us,
they built machinery out
and made the product,
and by mid?2017,
they were online,
they invested in us,
and I also managed to get almost
all of our shelf space back.
What percentage of your equity
do they own?
Right now, they're on
a convertible note,
so it's gonna equate
to about 3% to 4%.
Wow.
What's your
ultimate pain point,
and what's
your ultimate need?
Yeah, the pain point right now
is not having
enough marketing dollars.
You're gonna spend the whole
$250,000 on marketing?
We're gonna spend
about 65% on production...
?Yeah.
?...and about 30% on marketing
and 5% for working capital.
But you're gonna have to
do multiple rounds
as distribution grows
just for inventory, too, right?
Absolutely.
I love the packaging,
I love the look,
I love the logo ??
everything.
I think it's really,
really great.
I do think, though,
the beverage industry
is very competitive,
and I just don't think
I have the expertise here
to help you.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Lori.
Oza: I think the product
is good, but food for thought ??
the refrigeration
is definitely a concern.
Well, I look at ??
This refrigerator
scares me.
Well, there's a lot of brands
that you have invested in
that are refrigerated.
They still scare me.
[ Laughter ]
And they ?? they've actually ??
they've really
taken off even more.
Yeah, I've ??
It's been a lot of work,
you know, to push the brands
to get to scale.
So, now, I was involved
in Vita Coco.
Coconut water
can get scalable.
Vita Coco is, you know,
doing hundreds of millions of
dollars in sales at the moment.
The reason that it did so well
was...shelf stable.
My gut operationally
is telling me
this is gonna be a much longer
slog than you think,
and so, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Okay.
Boom laka laka laka,
boom laka laka laka.
Thank you, Rohan.
Alex,
does that discourage you,
hearing that
from a guy in the business?
Not at all.
Not at all.
There's plenty of
refrigerated beverages
that have grown and exited.
Alex, I invested in
two different soda companies
about three years apart.
I put my heart
and soul into it.
In the end,
they ran out of money,
the money went south,
and I swore to myself
I would never,
ever invest
in any kind of
a beverage company again.
All right?
But there's a few things here
that are tempting me.
in Alex's coconut smoothie
company, Genius Juice.
I swore to myself
I would never, ever invest
in any kind of
a beverage company again.
All right?
But I love that this damn thing
is so delicious.
This coconut is the best
I've ever had.
Nothing else like it.
It's creamy, delicious.
I swear I'm drinking
1,000 calories,
but it's 100 calories.
That's great, all right?
And so for that reason,
I'm gonna go against my gut,
and I'm gonna
make you an offer.
But the 7% isn't gonna
get me up in the mornings.
I'll give you the $250,000,
but I want 14%.
Ouch!
Okay.
Corcoran:
That's not an "ouch."
?That's an "ouch."
?That's a "yahoo"!
A coconut fell
on your head.
And, Alex, I was interested,
but I would have asked for more.
And so I'll defer to Barb
since she's asking for less,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay, thank you, Mark.
I hate beverage deals 'cause of
the distribution problems
and all the other stuff
we're talking.
But this is good stuff.
Thank you.
Here's the problem
with the deal.
I know you're gonna have to
keep raising money
till the cows come home,
so if I give you $250,000
for 7% for $3.5 mill valuation,
I'm just gonna get diluted
into oblivion.
So, here's my offer.
I'll give you the $250,000.
It's debt, all right?
I'm gonna charge you 9% on it
for 3 years,
and I want the 7% equity.
You know, he's getting soft.
I love you, Alex.
Barbara, I can do $250,000
for 11%.
You're not interested in debt,
I take it?
No, I'm not interested
in debt.
Barb, if you put in $250,000
and I put in $250,000
and we get 25%,
'cause ??
Oh, I would do that. That's more
of a bite?size piece.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're each gonna put,
Mark and I,
$250,000 in,
but we want 25%.
Alex, you got
two great Sharks in that.
Oh.
Greiner:
Really delicious.
Thank you, guys.
?Congrats.
?Congrats, Alex.
?Okay.
?Congrats.
?Congratulations.
?High?five!
?Oh! [ Laughs ]
?Whoo!
Bayer:
I got two amazing Sharks
that have invested in a lot of
food and beverage companies.
They have a ton of experience,
and I think
they have what it takes
to join me
and also grow the company.
[ Laughter ]
Had to do that.
Mark, my two cents
on this thing?
Go deep.
Don't go nationwide.
We don't want your advice.
You didn't invest in it.
Oh, is that ?? Okay.
All right.
That's okay.
I'll always take advice.
You know why I invested in it?
That's fine.
No ?? No need.
Do you know why I invested?
Just to prove you wrong.
Barbara, I'm gonna
call you when I buy ??
I hate when
you play big shot.
I'm gonna prove you wrong.
[ Laughs ]
