Hi, Sharks.
My name's Chris Rodgers.
And I'm Geanie Rodgers
from Eagle, Idaho.
We're here
seeking $200,000
in exchange for a 20% stake
in our company, Rapid Rope.
Sharks, as parents of
five beautiful children
and an avid outdoorsman...
And outdoorswoman,
we can tell you,
you have to be ready
for the unexpected,
no matter where you are.
That's right.
You can never be too prepared.

Geanie, get the rope!
[ Growls ]
It's all tangled!
The Rapid Rope!
[ Laughter ]
Met Chris
going to nursing school.
Chris:
I keep the lights on.
So, I've been an electrical
lineman for over 20 years.
Everything I do in my job,
we use rope,
and I've also been an avid
outdoorsman and a hunting guide,
and everything we do
is with rope,
and it's always
just a traditional,
kind of a knotted mess.
Can I ask you, why did you
decide on this particular rope?
For one,
the strength.
How strong is it?
Could it hold Mark?
He's a little heavy.
Yeah, so ??
[ Laughs ]
We actually have a video
to show.
Yeah, we do have a video
to show the strength
of the rope.
Oh.
Oh, wow.
So, this is
a 2,000?pound shed.
Wow.
We did double the rope,
but we're lifting it
with this crane here.
And this just
is a good example
to show of how strong
this rope actually is.
Wow!
Okay, so, $200,000 investment
for 20% of the company?
Yes, sir.
You must have
a few sales going on.
Yeah, so, we launched
just about two years ago.
We have right at $172,000
in lifetime sales.
That's not bad.
So, what is
your means of selling?
Are you online only?
Are you at retail?
So, right now,
we're about 60% retail
and about 40% online
right now.
O'Leary: Which retailers?
Um, well, a large company
that we just signed with
is Duluth Trading.
Oh, good for you.
And, yeah, we're just
gonna be fulfilling
our second PO
with them soon.
Okay, break down
the numbers for me.
Retails for $24.95,
wholesales right at $14.97.
What's it cost you
to make?
Uh, with labor,
it's right at $5.65.
And where do you
make them at?
So, we have everything
in?house.
So, that's one of the great
things about...
All American?made?
Making jobs in Idaho.
In?house?
In Duluth?
Chris:
All American?made.
And we build them all,
put them together,
our family,
our kids, in our shop.
?You do them? Really?
?Yeah.
Greiner: So, you know,
in thinking about this,
Geanie:
When Barbara said she made
the decision from the heart,
it just made me feel like
what drives us
to do what we do
has a purpose.
If we can raise our children
to give back
and to make a difference
in humanity and in this world,
that is our
number?one goal.
?[ Growls ]
?Oh, he's back?
?No, no!
?Aah!
?He's back!
?[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God,
get out of here!
Get him, get him!
[ Growls ]
[ Roars ]
Ohh!
Corcoran: Oh, my God! Whoa!
