I'm not very outdoorsy handy.
I don't know how I could
blow up rope for you.
I'm out.
Okay. Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Guys, could I ??
We are all?in.
We did put in our own money ??
$115,000.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?And we are debt?free.
Are you both full?time
in this now?
S??
So, that's
a good question.
So, we would want
those lifetime sales to be more.
We started in 2017.
2017 late and 2018
was a little hard for us.
We have a son that we adopted
from Ethiopia,
and he was, um ??
he was diagnosed with
ulcerative colitis.
He had a lot of
health issues.
So, through that time,
we spent a lot of trips
back and forth
to Seattle Children's
from our home.
Every dime, every moment,
every time that we had,
it was making sure
that he was getting
the proper care
that he needed.
My wife,
she quit her job
so we would have
adequate time for that,
and I needed to have
that security
of the job that I had
with the insurance
and everything like that
before we could
jump in with both feet
with Rapid Rope.
How's he doing?
He's doing amazing.
?Good.
?Great.
He's gaining weight.
How old is your son?
12.
He's 12.
And what inspired you
to do that?
You already had four kids.
You know, I think it was just
deep down part of who we are.
We always knew we wanted
to give back, and...
you know,
Zade inspired us
and helped us probably more
than we helped him, for sure.
You know,
that is our "why."
It's not the money.
Our purpose is to be able
to give back.
We feel a responsibility ??
?Good for you guys.
?That's lovely.
...our whole family does ??
to build a school
in Zade's name,
and we volunteer for
an organization
that helps children
in Africa.
We did a fun run for them
last Saturday.
That's who we are.
You guys make me feel like
a really bad parent.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
Look, I mean,
I'm not an outdoors guy.
It's just not my speed,
but congratulations.
Thank you.
I mean, it's in your heart,
it's in your face,
it's in your smile.
Thank you.
You guys glow when you talk
about your family
and the business...
Yeah, absolutely.
...so I see nothing but
great things for you,
but unfortunately, I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Congrats.
I also think
you're terrific people.
The challenge is, I don't know
how to blow it up.
I'm out.
Guys, we have a lot of great
entrepreneurs come on this show.
You guys are special people.
Thank you.
This is the American dream,
and you're domestic?made,
your products are local,
you put your all into it.
I don't know exactly
how to help.
I mean, I want to help you
as people,
but from a business standpoint,
something doesn't fit.
My only help that I could
probably give is,
you guys just did a run to raise
money for your African cause...
Yeah.
...so I would like
to add to that run.
Awesome.
I'll donate
$10,000 to that.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
Oh, wow.
But as far as
an investment standpoint,
it's tough for me to
get behind this
'cause I'm not sure I could
provide the value you guys need.
For that reason, I'm out.
You know, I've been sitting here
thinking to myself,
"What do I know about rope?"
Not a damn thing.
[ Laughter ]
But I've fallen in love
with you,
which is not a good reason to
make a business decision at all,
except, ironically,
my best decisions on this show
have been from my heart,
and those, ironically,
are the ones I've made
the most money from.
You're standing here, and you
remind me of Grace &amp; Lace.
What is rockin' amazing
about Grace &amp; Lace
and why they deserve the
enormous success they have,
$86,000 to $46 million
in sales...
Wow.
...remarkable story,
is because they've built,
I believe,
12 orphanages
and 2 schools in India.
Wow.
They take their money
and they share.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're just good people
from the top of their head
to their heel.
You're the walking,
talking example
of the American dream, period.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I have no doubt in my mind
you're gonna make it.
Okay, so, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'm going to give you the
$200,000 which you asked for,
but I want 30%
with the contingency
that we agree on
how the money is spent.
Take it.
Would you go 25%?
I don't love you that much.
No, 30%.
Ha!
[ Laughter ]
Remember,
it's still a Shark Tank.
We appreciate everybody here
today and taking your time,
but, Barbara,
we'll accept your offer.
?Yeah!
?Whoo!
[ Applause ]
Congratulations,
guys.
?Congrats, guys.
?Congrats, guys.
Thank you so much.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Daniel Zekowski.
I'm Dr. Katie Marks?Cogan.
And I'm
Dr. Andy Lightner.
We're from Los Angeles,
and we're seeking $350,000
for 7% equity in our company.
Ready.
Set.
Together: Food!
Sharks, did you know
that babies aren't born
with food allergies?
They develop over time.
But now clinical studies suggest
that feeding allergenic foods ??
like peanuts, eggs, and milk ??
to babies
can actually help prevent
food allergies.
As an allergist,
this is really exciting news.
That's amazing, right?
But feeding peanuts and eggs
to babies
can be difficult
'cause they have no teeth.
[ Ding! ]
That's why we've outsmarted
these babies
by creating
Ready, Set, Food!
Our revolutionary approach makes
this super simple for parents
by turning organic peanut,
egg, and milk
into powder
that dissolves easily
in breast milk or formula.
Just tear open
a packet...
pour it
into the bottle...
...give it
a quick shake,
and it's ready for
your baby to drink.
It's as easy as
one bottle a day.
And babies love
Ready, Set, Food!
Okay, they can't actually
taste it,
but they'd be thrilled
to know
they're on the path
to an allergy?free future,
which is why it's so important
for every parent
to be doing
early allergen introduction.
Sharks,
who's ready to join us
to help the millions of babies
born every year
reduce their risk
of food allergies?
We're ready.
Ready.
Set.
Together: Food!
Marks?Cogan: If anyone wants to
go ahead and take a sip...
Oza: Okay.
...we can start with that.
It tastes like
a light peanut.
It has a light
peanut flavor,
but they typically
can't taste that
over the breast milk
or the formula.
You're saying
if you feed a baby
a tiny, tiny, tiny dose
of the allergen,
they build up an immunity
to getting allergic to it?
What we know from
landmark clinical trials
and now national guidelines
is that feeding babies
allergenic foods during infancy,
when their immune systems
are still developing,
we have a chance to help
mold their immune systems
towards tolerance.
So, you're giving eggs,
you're giving peanuts,
you're giving, you know,
typical well?known allergens.
But this doesn't cover all
allergic food groups, right?
So, that's a great point.
We chose these three allergens
for two reasons ??
prevalence
and quality of life.
Peanut, egg, and milk
are the most common
childhood food allergens.
Okay.
They also make up 80% of
food allergies in children,
and you know that milk and egg
are everywhere ??
pizza, cake, cupcakes,
cookies, et cetera.
And so think about
the quality of life
for that food?allergic child
and their family.
Are there any children that
should not use this protocol?
Right, like...
Any child who's diagnosed
with a food allergy
should speak with
their pediatrician first
just, you know,
like they shouldn't eat
any foods
they're allergic to.
You're recommending go to your
doctor first, your pediatrician.
But is there any signal that
would say "Never use this"?
Absolutely.
Just a pre?existing allergy
would be the only signal.
How long is the protocol?
Ready, Set, Food! recommends
continuing it for six months...
Six months.
...or until
the baby is regularly
eating those foods
in their diet.
I want to find out
about sales.
Oza: Right.
Well,
we have great sales.
?Good.
?Year to date,
we've had
$250,000 of sales,
and that was
a very soft launch
focused mostly on
pediatricians' offices.
This is
your first full year.
Correct.
And then what do you expect
to end the year at?
We expect to end the year
a little above, like, $450,000.
$400,000 ?? okay.
And where are you selling?
So, we sell right now through
our website and Amazon,
and we also have
about 300 pediatricians
that recommend our product
in their office.
And how long
are your subscriptions?
On average, 4 1/2 months is
how long people stay with us
for an average amount of
probably about $150,
but we're gonna be launching
other products later this year
that will allow us to
extend lifetime value
so that we'll have products
to protect babies
from food allergies from birth
until 4 years of age.
Is there anything proprietary
about this formula
that I can't
knock off myself?
There is. Our patent pending
has many features,
but the three most important
are the bottle introduction
so that all babies can do this
at the right time.
The second
is this guided system
so it's easy
for families to use.
Do you have competition?
We do have
some competition.
We're the only product
who introduces allergens
through a bottle.
Our competitors have
a variety of products ??
for example,
applesauce pouches
that already
have allergens in it.
But those are just not
the right format.
How did you
come up with this?
So, let me tell you
a little bit
about the inspiration
for the company.
We actually have
a photo of him,
and I'll tell you
about my family.
?Aww.
?So, that's Abe.
?Cute.
?So, Abe is 3 years old.
I'm a practicing
physician.
I work
at a cancer hospital.
There was a time
in the past
where I had to
rush home from work
because Abe was having a severe
food?allergy reaction.
Oh, my gosh.
I wouldn't want anyone
to go through
that experience.
Oh, we have.
So, that's why I'm so passionate
about our mission
to prevent food allergies
before they start.
How much cash have you invested
in the business?
So far, we've raised
$2.4 million...
?Ooh.
?Wow!
...all at the same valuation
that we're inviting you
to join at.
When I look at this, I think
it doesn't promise enough.
I'd like it to clearly say
"Avoids allergies,"
but you can't make that claim.
You can't go that far
to actually say
"Avoids allergies," right?
That's exactly right.
So, that's why we primarily
focus through online sales
where we can wrap it
in additional context
and education that really helps
describe the product.
Yeah, but you still
have to be there to
describe it, to say it.
You've got to put other words.
Right, 'cause you have
your name ?? Yeah.
So, it's not
clear as a crystal bell
that if I pick this up,
I'm gonna avoid allergies.
I think that's a weakness,
and for those reasons, I'm out.
What does it cost me
to buy this?
$48 a month
is our retail price.
And what does it cost you
to make it?
Our cost right now is $10.50,
so we have 70% margin.
What's my total cost
per child?
So, if you pre?pay all up front,
it's $200.
If you pay month by month,
it's $288.
So, for $288, I can maybe stop
my child from having an allergy?
Yes, absolutely.
That's a good
value proposition.
Does it have to be equity?
I feel
a royalty's coming.
I would do this deal
one of two ways.
?Thank you so much.
?Katie, thank you so much.
We're gonna save
a lot of kids together.
Oh, absolutely.
This is really, really exciting.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, guys.
You're gonna put a lot more
money in. You know that?
Marks?Cogan: We're so pumped,
and we're just so motivated
to have Mark on board.
Zekowski: We're just gonna
take that excitement
and use it to bring
Ready, Set, Food!
to every baby in America
so that they all can have
the best chance at not
developing food allergies.
We're ready.
Ready.
Set.
Together: Food!
