Hello, Sharks.
My name is Laura Schubert.
And I'm Lillian Tung.
We're here
from New York City
seeking $500,000
for 2.5% equity in our company.
?What?!
?What?!
?Whew!
?I see dead people!
[ Laughs ]
Now, Sharks, we all know
that hairstyles change
over the years.
But I'm not just talking about
the hair on your head.
We're also talking about...
Both: Pubic hair!
Wait.
Can we say that on TV?
I don't know,
but I guess we just did.
We're here to tell you that no
matter what your preference is,
it's great to embrace
whatever you're into.
Let's say you're anything
like our friend Bo.
She likes to keep her hair
full and bushy.
Come on out, Bo.
Uh?oh.
?Oh.
?[ Laughs ]
Aww. Aww.
Similar to Bo,
some people like to keep
their hair full?grown,
keeping their silky locks
or curls
all natural
and feeling free.
Or if you're like
our friend Peep,
summertime means keeping things
sleek and shaven.
There's conditioner
for head hair...
[ Laughter ]
...lotions for your bodies, and
even serums to keep acne away.
So, tell me, why is there
nothing for pubic hair?
Well, Sharks,
that's where we come in.
Thanks, Bo and Peep.
We'll take it from here.
Aww.
[ Sheep bleats ]
Both: Introducing Fur!
The first line of all?natural
and effective skin and hair care
for up top, down there,
and everywhere in between.
So, whether you think
the bush is back or skin is in,
Fur is here to take care of
your body in an upscale way.
Sharks,
we are on a mission
to destroy the taboo
around pubic hair.
Both: So, tell us,
who's with us?
[ Chuckles ]
And we have samples.
?Okay.
?All right.
Well...
It's an interesting product.
Daymond.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lori.
Thank you.
Thanks, Mr. Wonderful.
I don't want the same
hair product as Kevin.
[ Laughter ]
You don't need the same
hair product I have.
Nice suit.
Cuban: The best part
is, there's towels.
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
?Pretty bottle.
?And for you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you. Yes.
Appreciate it.
Thanks.
Schubert:
So, in front of you,
you have our signature product,
Fur Oil.
This really put us
on the map in 2017
Laura has spent 10 years
in corporate America,
most recently as
a management consultant.
So, I've been working on Fur
since 2014.
I wanted the solution myself,
and I just knew
that other women and men
wanted options like I did
to take care of
their hair and skin.
We have created
an entirely new category here.
I have to admit, you're sounding
less crazy by the minute.
[ Chuckles ] Thank you.
Well, thank you.
'Cause you started
at crazy factor 110.
Well, it's not crazy, right?
There's an opportunity there.
How much have you guys
put in yourselves,
and how much have you raised,
and do you have any debt?
We've put in $500,000
into the business...
?Whoa!
?Whoa!
?Good for you.
...between the two of us.
That's all?in.
That's all?in.
We are all?in.
That's our life savings.
It's our life savings.
We have no other investors.
Good for you guys.
And no debt.
No other investors
and no debt.
Okay, now I'm getting
<i>really</i> interested.
What are the sales
of Fur?
We're on track
to do $5 million this year.
Cuban: Good for you guys.
And what is
most of your sales?
Is it the oil
or the other products?
No, it's actually around
the whole product line.
O'Leary: Why don't you walk us
through your margins?
Yeah.
Sure.
For the Fur Oil,
it's $46,
and it costs us
$5.34 to make it.
?I love this business.
?Wow.
And the other products?
On average,
our line is $37,
and $7.63 is our average
fully absorbed.
Have I told you
how much I love it?
[ Laughs ]
Those margins are obscene.
Where are we year?to?date,
just so ??
I'm all about
the nether regions.
$3.5 million year?to?date.
Tung: And we haven't
hit holiday yet.
That's pretty good.
Now, valuation, ladies.
$500,000 for 2.5%.
I don't get out of bed to do
anything with my nether regions
for 2.5%.
Well,
in the beauty industry ??
You must have flexibility.
In the beauty industry,
it's common
for companies to sell for
four to six times revenue.
Guys, congratulations on what
you've done so far, right?
Thank you.
Thank you.
I love the confidence
that you have
'cause you <i>know</i>
it's going to happen, right?
But it's not really
a fit for me,
but I don't have
any doubt in my mind
that you're gonna be
insanely successful.
So congrats,
but for those reasons, I'm out.
Okay,
thank you very much.
Understood.
You're welcome.
What's the model?
Have you considered licensing?
Because you can get people
to use <i>their</i> money
and distribution,
get it to a nice level,
a 3?year, a 5?year license,
and then still have
the opportunity to sell.
Hell no. Hell no.
?No. No way.
?Why not?
Why?
They're killing it!
Greiner: They don't need to.
And it's
a mission?based brand.
We need to own the branding
and the authenticity.
Listen, I would give you
the $500,000 for 15%.
Thank you very much
for that offer.
Uh...
Wow, you girls
aren't fooling around.
[ Laughs ]
Why should they?
Does that mean yes?
O'Leary: Well, while
you're thinking about that,
let me throw something
on the table,
because I am really impressed,
all right?
Oh, here we go.
Because my creative juices
are flowing.
Oh, no, she's already...
[ Laughter ]
We're ready.
We're ready.
Laura and Lillian have one offer
on the table from Daymond
for their body hair care line,
Fur.
But Kevin also seems interested.
O'Leary:
So, I'll give you the $500,000,
but your margins are
obscenely wonderful.
There's plenty of space
in here...
For a royalty.
...to give me $1 per bottle
per SKU
until I get back $1 million.
Then it stops, goes away.
And I want the 2.5% equity
so I have some skin in the game.
I'll do that deal
right now with you.
Thank you very much
for that offer.
It's a great offer.
Let's be ?? you're not
the best spokesperson for this.
I'm a fantastic
spokesperson.
[ Laughs ]
I think it's interesting,
but you said that
you have a mission.
What exactly
is your mission?
We want everyone
to feel comfortable
with their body hair
expressions,
whatever they may be,
and we are trying to ultimately
increase body positivity
and acceptance,
you know, for the future.
So,
that's the bigger thing.
Exactly.
The whole mission is really
more about feeling good
about yourself.
Yes.
So, let me present
something to you, okay?
I will give you $500,000.
I want 12%.
And why don't we say
that we will take
in the first year $50,000
and put it towards a charity
that will help
to start putting the message
out there
for people to feel better
about their body,
no matter how big, how small,
how hairy, or whatever.
O'Leary: What do you want to do?
You have three offers.
But we may have one
from Maria.
Yes, no?
I like the space.
I invested in Supergoop,
which is a sunscreen brand,
after being a fan
and using the product,
finding it on the shelves
of Sephora,
and became an investor
a few years ago.
But 2.5% is really nothing.
Um...I feel like I would need
so much more skin in the game
just to feel passionate about
what I'm involved with.
There's a lot of work.
2.5% is just ??
it's not enough.
So I'm out.
Whoa.
Okay, thank you
for your candid feedback.
You have three offers.
What are you gonna do?
Well, thank you all for
your offers, first of all.
And?
Would any of you
do $500,000 for 5%?
I would not.
I wouldn't, either.
Daymond?
No. I can't do it at 5%.
I will go to 10%. I will go down
to 10% from 15%.
You clearly don't want
to give up equity.
You understand my offer,
don't you?
Listen, I offered you what
I thought was my best offer.
I mean, we love the angle,
the charity angle,
so thank you very much
for being so creative with that.
I know that I can help you
blow up fast,
but it has to mean something
to me, as well.
Every Shark's gonna tell you
the same thing.
We should get to
the endgame here.
I think Daymond's
sitting around 10%, right?
Yeah, but...
You know,
sometimes it's gut feeling.
I think you are
both brilliant, but...
I'm starting not to think that
we would be good partners,
'cause I don't think
they understand the value,
so I'm just going to
take my deal off the table,
my offer off the table.
I'm out.
What do you think,
Lillian?
All right,
I think we have a deal.
We have a deal.
Done! Whoa!
John: There you go.
Yay!
?Congrats.
?Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Congrats.
You did a great job,
you guys.
We look forward to
working with you.
?Congrats, guys.
?And good luck to you.
?Thank you.
?Good luck.
Well, I didn't plan
on this today.
[ Laughs ]
No, definitely not.
Tung:
With Lori now on our side,
it strengthens the mission,
brings it to the masses.
That charitable component ??
which is also, again,
mission?driven ??
is really
just gonna bolster
what we stand for
and what we believe in.
