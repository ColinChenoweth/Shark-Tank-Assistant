So, in front of you,
you have our signature product,
Fur Oil.
This really put us
on the map in 2017
Laura has spent 10 years
in corporate America,
most recently as
a management consultant.
So, I've been working on Fur
since 2014.
What do you think,
Lillian?
All right,
I think we have a deal.
We have a deal.
Done! Whoa!
John: There you go.

With Lori now on our side,
it strengthens the mission,
