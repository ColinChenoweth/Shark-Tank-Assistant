Hi, Sharks.
My name is Natalie Holloway,
and this is my husband
and co?founder, Max Kislevitz.
We're from Los Angeles,
California,
and we're seeking $400,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Sharks,
you remember the '80s.
Aerobics
were all the rage.
And who could forget the wacky
fashion that came with it?
From headbands to leotards,
from leg warmers
to ?? you guessed it ??
wrist and ankle weights.
Mr. Wonderful,
I'm sure <i>you</i> remember it
like it was
just yesterday.
[ Imitating workout music ]
All right,
are you guys ready?
It's that time.
I know you're ready,
'cause <i>I'm</i> ready.
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
Oh, yeah.
It's time to sweat.
I'm strong.
I'm strong.
I'm strong, strong, strong,
strong, strong.
Nice!
?[ Laughs ]
I'm late for my meeting.
Susan, hold my calls.
Nice!
[ Laughter ]
Great job, guys.
Great job!
Let's take five and cool off.
Nice.
[ Laughter ]
"Susan, hold my calls."
Sharks,
I am sure we can agree
that some trends were
better left in the past!
But of all the changes
over the last 40 years,
there's just one
that stayed the same ??
the sweaty, loose, sand?filled
wrist and ankle weight.
That is, until now!
Introducing...
Both: Bala Bangles!
The world's first...
Stylish...
Wearable weights.
Adding our weights
to your workout
will increase heart rate,
burn fat, and build muscle!
So, when you wiggle, there'll be
a little less jiggle.
Yeah.
So whether you're channeling
your inner yogi...
Or training for
that next marathon...
Bala Bangles will make you
sweat in style.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to get sweaty?
We will now pass out
some samples for you all to try,
and I'll show you
how to put them on.
So, what you're gonna want to
do, Velcro facing out,
and then you just roll down
like this and roll up.
The first time you do it,
it's a little tricky,
but then you're good.
As tight or loose
as you want.
And thank you, guys.
We can take it from here.
All right, guys.
Max:
So, our first product is
the 1?pound wrist and ankle
weight that you guys have.
Bala is designed
to be additive
to a workout that is
already exhausting.
These are gonna make it
incrementally harder.
I know we're supposed to
ask <i>you</i> questions,
but when was the last time
that you worked out, Kevin?
Oh, shazam!
Excuse me, Maria.
I think that's very important
before ??
You may want
to know this.
I got up at 4:30 this morning
to work out.
But I appreciate the fact
to be able to match my watchband
to this red weight.
I like that.
I like the outside texture,
as well.
You look spectacular.
You know what I really like
about these?
I like the fact that you don't
have to hold anything.
Yeah, and that's how it was
designed, actually.
I'm a certified
yoga instructor.
So, basically, it's hands?free
so I can do yoga,
all of my poses, without
having to pick up dumbbells,
put them down,
and I can literally
do a whole class of yoga
and get that extra oomph.
Okay, guys,
you're asking for $400,000
for 10% of the company,
correct?
That's right.
That's correct.
So, what are your sales?
So, last year,
which was our first
six months in business,
we did $260,000.
Wow!
And then this year so far,
we're at $1.2 million.
?$1.2 million?
?Wow!
We'll end the year
with $2.2 million.
?Whoa!
?Good for you.
We just placed POs with
Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom.
So, we're 60% retail,
we're 30% Amazon,
we're 10% direct?to?consumer
through our website.
Our blended margin
is about 58.3% gross,
and we net about 49%.
Having said that,
our biggest challenge
and why we're here is,
we've been trapped in
this vicious inventory cycle.
It's been difficult for us to
keep the right level of product.
Yeah, inventory management
is always a pain.
Yep.
What does this retail at?
Well, landed, we're $12.
We can get that down.
Wholesale, we're $25,
and retail, we're $49.
Cuban: Good for you.
John: What are you gonna
use the money for?
Two key challenges.
The first is inventory, which
we spoke a little bit about.
The second is, we're not
out there proactively selling
because we're just trying to
keep up with the orders.
So we believe your capital
will help us
solve the inventory issue
and then to bring in
an external salesperson
to essentially blitz the market
so that nobody copies us.
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Why bring in another partner
right now?
I mean, you're gonna make
$2 million next year.
Because they need help
to market this thing.
Mm?hmm.
Yeah.
Sharapova: If I were to
make this investment,
how do you see me
helping you?
Besides the money.
You bring a tremendous amount
of credibility to the product.
To have you
endorse this product,
you know,
there's no better supporter.
So you would see me as
a spokesperson for this product?
Yes. And you are
literally, like ??
We looked at
your Instagram.
You're literally
our Bala customer.
O'Leary:
All right, guys, look.
I like it because it's got
fantastic numbers.
I'm gonna go at it
a different way.
You need capital for inventory.
It's a classic problem.
I'll give you the $400,000
as debt for three years, okay?
And I'm gonna charge you
7.5% interest on it.
I want 5% equity in the company
for doing this.
You get the benefit of
being in my ecosphere
of "Shark Tank" companies,
There's a lot of sports stars
and sports owners
and yada, yada, yada.
[ Laughs ]
But there's only one
Mr. Wonderful.
Sure. Thank you very much
for the offer.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, it's a start,
let me tell you.
"Thank you very much
and buh?bye."
Because you shouldn't
give up too much equity,
given the ramp you've got.
Let's hear
the other offers.
Narrator:
Max and Natalie have one offer
on the table from Kevin
for their wearable weights
company, Bala Bangles.
Maria is also interested,
but she wants to partner
with another Shark.
I would take 30%.
I would match that.
I would jump in there with her.
I will just share with you.
I really love it.
I'm just letting you know,
I would match that, as well.
I would match her offer.
I think these are fantastic.
Maria,
I will do it with you.
$200,000 from me,
$200,000 from you for 30%.
I just said
I'd go in with her.
You feel 30% is
the right offer.
But I have
the same proposal,
so I will take this out
internationally and...
I can blitz you into the stores
all over.
All over.
We can <i>all</i> do that.
O'Leary:
Maria, you threw out an offer ??
you threw out an offer here,
and you said
you wanted another Shark.
You now have two Sharks fighting
to be your partner.
What did you decide, Mark?
What are you gonna do?
Would you be happy to go in
with another Shark?
I'm listening, right?
Okay.
Because I think you have to be
fair to <i>them</i> first and foremost.
Yep.
Kislevitz: We don't want to
erode the value of the company
below $3 million,
and we don't want to give up
more than 25%
unless two Sharks
were involved,
in which case,
we'd go up to 30%
because we understand
that you need
a big enough
piece of the pie
to sort of make sense
of the investment.
So you are saying
you'll part with 30% equity
if two Sharks
are involved?
At a $3 million valuation.
You want $900,000?
So each Shark has to put up
$450,000 to do your deal?
That's a big lift on your ask,
my friend.
That's huge.
Stop whispering over there,
Mark.
You're not in on this.
Yeah, and don't try to
throw me under the bus.
Don't try it, Mark.
I don't throw anybody
under the bus.
Maria, is Mark trying to
woo you away from me?
Sharapova: I think...
Is he? Is Mark trying to
woo you away from me?
Mark wants to
do a deal, as well.
From me.
I don't like that.
You know what?
I'm sorry ??
I don't like that.
I'm gonna
make my own offer.
So, my offer is
$500,000, 18%.
