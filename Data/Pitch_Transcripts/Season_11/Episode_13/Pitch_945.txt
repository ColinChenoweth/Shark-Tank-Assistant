Michael:
Well, it seems early to you,
but all of you
are entrepreneurs.
You've all
built businesses.
You all had to say yes to things
that you weren't yet ready for.
You all had to take
that leap of faith.
Yeah.
Cuban: But you do that
as an entrepreneur,
not necessarily
as an investor.
That's the challenge.
It's not that we don't
think you can do it.
But you haven't shown
that it's replicable yet.
Basically, you're telling me
I got to spend $1 million ??
that's what you're doing
on your store.
The million is for the showroom,
the flagship.
I know, but that's
a really bad showroom.
It shows me
it's a bad franchise.
It's bigger than what it needs
to be because we're gonna be
training our franchisees.
Well,
why are you doing that?
Michael:
You know, if we can count
every time
someone said no to us ??
every bank,
every investor,
every accountant
who said no to us ??
we wouldn't be here.
What, five more nos?
We can take it.
Yeah.
