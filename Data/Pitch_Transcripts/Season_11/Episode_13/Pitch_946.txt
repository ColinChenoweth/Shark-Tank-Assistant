and endorsement deals
from pretty major companies.
I started to understand that
tennis wasn't just a game.
That was the first time
that I really got a sense
of the real business world.
In 2012, I decided to start my
candy company called Sugarpova.
I've had a sweet tooth ever
since I was a very young girl,
and I still very much do.
We need to continue being fun,
colorful, and flirty.
[ Chuckles ]
After being a small part
of many big brands,
I wanted to be the one in the
front office making decisions.
When you're in charge
of your own business,
it's a completely different
ballgame.
You're in charge
of the distribution,
you're in charge
of the creative,
you're in charge
of the people you hire,
and I really wanted
to make that step.
I like to invest in companies
that I'm personally
passionate about.
I invested in Supergoop,
a sunscreen brand that
I've loved for many years.
I invested in the UFC because
I saw its potential worldwide.
I like the attitude that
so many entrepreneurs have
that come on the show.
It's this "I won't give up
until I get what I want."
That is the American dream,
that there is no finish line
to what they do.
I had a very singular path
in my life
toward becoming
a successful athlete.
I wanted to achieve big things,
I had big goals,
and I still think
that there's more to achieve
on and off the court.
Hey, Sharks. I'm Brett.
And I'm AJ.
And we're seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 20% of our company.
Sharks, would you enjoy eating
the same thing every single day?
Of course you wouldn't.
And dogs don't like it, either.
That's why
AJ and I created
Shake it Pup!
dog food seasoning.
Dogs get tired of eating the
same thing over and over again.
And with
such limited diets,
they miss out on
important nutrients.
But don't take
<i>our</i> word for it.
Just ask Chef Cooper.
?Aww!
?Hey, Coop.
Do you like eating the same
boring food every single day?
We're shaking up and waking up
the dog food industry.
With Shake it Pup!,
our furry family members
can now enjoy a humanlike
mealtime experience,
with a new feast to look
forward to every single day.
But what does it take?
It takes...
just one shake
to turn that bland dog food
into a filet mignon.
You'll be your dog's
personal gourmet chef
with just the shake
of a bottle.
Chef Cooper, what's on
tonight's main course?
[ Laughter ]
Pizza it is.
Our handcrafted,
all?natural recipes
allows pup parents
to tailor their meals
directly to their dog's
unique tastes
and nutritional
requirements.
[ Laughter ]
There's a seasoning for
every reason <i>and</i> every season.
Sharks, with your help, we'll be
able to streamline production
and take a bite out of
the dog food industry.
So, who's ready
to shake hands
and shake...
It...
Both: ...Pup?
[ Laughter ]
Chef Cooper
does have samples
for all of you, as well.
?Come here. Hi. Hi, baby.
?Aww.
?Hi!
John: Hey!
Here.
Thank you, sir.
?You're welcome.
?Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you very much.
?You are welcome.
And it's all human?grade,
all local and organic
ingredients and natural.
This is just a seasoning,
right?
So it goes on top of all
the food that we serve?
Correct. So, compared to
a lot of toppers,
if you put
a freeze?dried topper,
or meat, for example,
dogs just pick it out.
They eat around it.
We always make the joke that,
you know, dogs are like kids ??
they eat the marshmallows
in cereal
and leave
everything else.
What we do
completely coats the food
so it adds a whole new
flavor profile,
and you're able to
mix up meals
without changing their diet
completely.
What else is out there
that's comparable?
Our main competitors are wet
foods that we find, and then,
as well as freeze?dried
toppers, meat?based.
Well, then let's get into
the numbers. Prove it out.
Yeah, how long have you
been in business?
Okay, so, in the first
annual year ??
We launched a little over
a year ago,
and in the last annual year,
we've done $105,000 in sales.
Initially,
when we launched,
we were still producing this
in?house.
It's a 350?square?foot
headquarters,
my living facilities,
and our production facilities.
So, we grew really fast.
We found traction right away.
We got in my truck
and drove to every store
and venue in California.
But we ran into production
issues right away.
Okay.
And we became
very agile ??
In other words,
you sold out.
And we sold out.
You don't
have a copacker yet.
We don't have a copacker.
Are you still
in that same apartment?
Yes.
So, we actually have invested
everything we've made
back into small equipment,
production equipment.
But we're not production guys.
We're not manufacturing guys.
Greiner: Right.
We've done this
out of necessity.
How much are these selling for,
each unit?
Sure.
So, on average, about $2.45
is our cost to make them,
and they sell for $12.99.
?Good for you.
?What?
?Wow.
?$13?
?We knew you'd like that.
Yeah, that was ?? And each
bottle lasts 30 to 60 meals.
You're not saying a lot.
What do you do in the company?
I know, because, obviously,
he speaks so well,
and he knows he's on top
of everything,
so I just got to kind of
let him go with it.
What is your background?
Yeah, of course.
Like any good story, we've been
best friends since second grade,
and we met
on the school bus,
and our friendship has kind of
always revolved around dogs.
The very first moment
I met him ??
Sounds so romantic.
I know.
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, Lord.
?It's not.
It's not romantic.
Don't worry.
I was on the school bus,
and my dog at that time, Bailey,
wasn't doing too well,
and on the way home,
I just had the sense
that Bailey died.
And I started crying
on the bus,
and Brett was sitting
in the seat behind me,
peeks his head over and asks,
"Why are you crying?"
We start talking.
He tells me about his dogs,
Maddy and Buddy,
and here we are today.
Okay, so, let's get back
to business.
Okay.
All right.
So, the challenge
is capital.
Every company's gonna
go through that.
"If I only had more money,
I could reach everybody."
Right.
But there's a point of
diminishing returns.
Sure.
So, tell us about
your inventory right now.
So, right now, we have
about 3,000 bottles,
and that's about
a month and a half's
supply for us.
Essentially, we are ordering
when we get the POs.
O'Leary: Have you gone
and investigated any copackers
in the spice space,
for example?
We have, and we know
the minimums
are gonna be
about 3,000 bottles per SKU.
Okay.
And we're still narrowing down
the actual price per ??
Give me a range.
That would drop our costs
down to close to $2.
What do you need us for?
We cannot produce this
ourselves anymore.
We need a partner.
So, right now, we pay ??
37% of our costs are packaging
and labeling,
which is astronomical
because we don't have
any purchasing power.
Over the last decade
of "Shark Tank,"
I have seen every crazy
doggy idea and then more.
And every single one of them
goes through the roof
when people see ??
It's sick.
It's so crazy how much money
people spend on dogs.
So I'm converted, okay?
I get it. I get it.
I think this idea is nuts,
but I know it's gonna work,
because I look at dogs
eating kibble saying,
"That must be
boring as hell."
And a little pizza,
or whatever it is,
it's interesting, but it's
a massive marketing problem.
I think it's a nightmare.
You guys are just so early.
Why do you think
it's a marketing problem?
Because no one knows
about this, and ??
Exactly ??
that's the beauty of it,
is so many people know
about so many things.
Yeah, I get it.
This is new.
It's so early.
I'm willing to
make you an offer.
Here it is.
It reflects the risk.
But I don't have a doggy do?do
in my portfolio right now.
Says the man who's like,
"This is nuts, and I
don't see it working."
Kevin always talks up the risks
so he can undercut his offer.
O'Leary: Of course.
Yeah.
It's better than nothing.
Do you want to hear it or not?
So, silence from
the doggy gallery.
Well, <i>I</i> do, so...
I am going to make an offer.
Here it is.
I'm gonna give you
the $100,000,
but commensurate with
how early?stage you are
and the nightmare of ??
I bet he's gonna ask
for a royalty.
Silence, please.
[ Laughs ]
I want 50%.
?Oh!
?[ Laughing ] Ohh!
That's worse!
Kevin!
That's worse.
Lots of noise.
I hear lots of noise.
I don't hear any offers.
I hear noise.
Greiner:
You're gonna get what?
I hear ?? I hear
doggies barking.
What is that?
Doggies barking.
I want 50%.
What do you say?
Uh...
[ Laughter ]
I'm gonna have to
feel out the room
and see if there are
some other offers.
O'Leary: You know,
you really should,
because if you don't get
anything else,
all roads go back to
Mr. Wonderful, as usual.
Maybe I can help you
with a decision.
You know, I think
it's a genius idea,
but I think that this is
a speed?to?market thing
that you have to do,
and I think that,
honestly, a lot of
the big boys and girls,
they're going to start putting
a lot of these offerings in,
and it's gonna be
a challenge to fight that.
And so I'm out.
Maiolfi: And to speak to that ??
Thank you, Daymond.
But as far as
dog food companies,
we were in that industry.
We speak with
a lot of the big boys.
They won't touch any toppers or
enhancers with a 10?foot pole.
They don't want to touch it
because what does that say
about their dog food?
Yeah, this isn't something
you want to release
with a dog food
manufacturer.
?Yeah.
?Right?
Sounds like
your biggest inhibitor
has just been
your ability to make it.
Right.
You have more demand than
you can fulfill right now.
Right.
Sharapova: I'm gonna
go ahead and say it.
I love your brand.
I love your marketing.
I love the category
that you're in.
There's a lot of opportunity,
but I also feel
that it's very crowded,
and this is very niche.
This is, like,
a second?step process.
So, to feel like I have to
get another something
to put on the food that
I already put on the plate
just seems like a lot,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
So, I think this is
really interesting,
'cause I do know people
that have dogs that are
very, very picky.
I don't know for sure ??
I haven't been able
to test this ??
but I think
people love their dogs,
and I think they would
like their dogs
to have
a more fun life experience.
So why not
make your dog's food better?
Maybe you could make cat food
better, too, right?
Rabbit food?
I mean, if it works, it could
become a line of something.
So I like
everything about it.
So, I'm gonna give you
the $100,000.
You have a lot of margin
here in your product, okay?
I'm gonna ask
for $1 per unit
until I get
the $100,000 back.
Then I'll go down
to 25 cents a unit.
John: Oh.
In perpetuity.
Forever and ever.
In perpetuity.
I would never do
that deal.
[ Laughs ]
But I'm only asking
for 3% equity.
That's it.
I'm not gonna be a 20% partner.
John: "Only."
You know, I'm the king of
royalties, and I know when
you can extract money.
3% of the company leaves you
with your company.
You can't afford it.
You don't have enough capital
to do that.
Well,
I'm giving them capital.
It makes no sense.
And then,
if we're doing fabulously,
I'll continue to bankroll
the purchase orders.
But those are two offers.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
Cuban: So, last year,
I did a deal with a company
called Wild Earth
that does organic dog food.
Wild Earth has been
a great success
because dog owners really care
about their pet health,
and they will spend anything
to do it the right way.
I think this would be
a great combination.
I'm not asking for a royalty,
but I do want equity, right?
Because I think
this can grow,
and I think that's where
the upside is.
So I'll offer you $100,000
for 25% equity.
Maiolfi: Um...
Well, let us talk to Cooper
about this first.
Oh, what,
you got to talk about it?
?Aww.
?Aww.
I think
we have a deal.
Done.
Appreciate it, guys.
Looking forward to it.
Thank you.
Appreciate it, guys.
And you, too!
Yeah! We'll do some business
and make you some money!
Greiner: Sweet dog.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you for your time.
Sharapova: Thank you very much.
Good luck.
Good presentation.
Good presentation.
Thank you.
[ Squeals ]
Whoo!
Maiolfi: We were in
our 350?square?foot studio,
and then today, to shake hands
with Mark Cuban
and have him on as a partner
is just insane to us.
Come here!
We did it!
We did it!
We did it!
when a major celebrity endorsed
it completely organically.
We actually sold out
of all of our stock
for an entire year
in only three weeks.
Who was it
that promoted it?
Emma Watson.
Then we also selected a product
from our line for each of you.
For Mark and Kevin,
we selected the Stubble Cream,
which is a great hit among men,
especially as an aftershave.
For Maria and Daymond, we chose
the Ingrown Concentrate,
which is our best?selling
ingrown hair serum.
And for Lori,
the luxurious Silk Scrub.
Sharapova: Smells great.
But to break into this market,
you needed a hook.
I get it ?? you went with
the pubic thing. Cool.
Greiner: Was that your hook?
But you must have
some extraordinary sales
to walk in here and say
that I'm gonna give you
$500,000 for 2.5%,
imputing
a $20 million valuation.
Bring it on!
John:
Before you answer that,
why would somebody
want to oil up ??
or oil down ??
their pubic hair?
Cuban: Daymond,
how can you even ask that?
[ Laughter ]
I just want to know
why you ?? you know,
somebody would
want to do that.
Everyone's suffered from
razor burn, ingrown hairs.
If you treat your pubic hair
and your body hair
like your head hair,
like your face,
you don't even
get ingrown hairs anymore.
It softens the hair
and clears your ??
Even if you wax?
Absolutely.
Waxing salons and spas are some
of our very best customers.
Why hasn't somebody else
done something like this?
It's a taboo category,
and no one's really taken it on
in an upscale, elevated way
that treats it
as a serious problem.
Cuban:
And that's the key, 'cause
there are some men's products,
but they're more
barbershop?type products,
none that are
on the higher end.
Tell us a little bit
about your background.
I've spent years at L'Oréal
developing makeup
and being in
the beauty industry.
