My name's Michael.
And my name is Eugene.
We're brothers from
Portland, Oregon,
and we're here
to raise $500,000
for 10% of our company,
Pips &amp; Bounce.
Sharks, we've all got
that one special thing
that brings us right back
to our happy place.
For us,
it's ping pong.
We grew up playing
a never?ending game
in our basement rec room
in Appalachian Kentucky.
Where I pretty much went
undefeated against this guy.
Well, after we grew up
and realized just how
disconnected we all had become,
we went back
to our fondest memories
and created...
Pips &amp; Bounce.
A unique ping pong social club
inspired by our childhood fun.
A gathering place where everyone
can get together
to eat, drink,
and ping some pong.
Complete with 100% authentic
oak?paneled walls,
great tunes,
and throwback posters.
Mark, looking good.
[ Laughter ]
That was last week.
[ Chuckles ]
Sharks, it's now time
to franchise.
Folks from all over have been
asking us to give them a way
to bring the fun of
Pips &amp; Bounce home with them.
So, Sharks, we invite you
to enjoy one of
our signature pong?tails
and join us as we create
a new family
of pong?trepreneurs
together with Pips &amp; Bounce.
Both: Who's in?
So, there must be
a profitable business here
if you want
to franchise it.
Why don't you walk us through
the numbers?
So, in our last three
fiscal years,
we started off with $974,000
in revenue,
and then the next year,
we pulled in $1.33 million.
The year after that,
$950,000.
So, we're kind of flat.
All right.
How many square feet
is the place?
Our first store
is 4,500 square feet.
So, if you're trying
to sell me a franchise,
you could make a claim
that you make at least, you
know, 1 million bucks a year.
What do you bring
in the bottom line
in the typical operation
of 4,500 square feet?
We're at
a 7% profit margin.
We've been building it
with this goal of
franchising it in mind.
And what was your history
prior to this?
I was in New York City.
I was doing business development
and marketing
for a big
international law firm.
Now,
what's <i>your</i> background?
So, I spend my days
saving the world
through
clean?energy policy.
[ Chuckles ]
But I spend my nights
and weekends
trying to bring people together
through the joy of ping pong.
O'Leary: Let's go back
to the business for a second,
because I invest in
franchise models.
I'm pretty familiar
with how it works.
You're making $1 million.
Let's keep the numbers even,
all right?
Okay.
You're making
7% for yourself.
$70,000 is being extracted
from the business
on the million?dollar model.
Now, in the franchise
business,
you want to get a royalty of 5%
to 7% for every one you sell.
So the business has to make
a minimum of 14% pre?tax.
The person that franchises
from you
is gonna pay you maybe $25,000
or $50,000 up front
to get all of your knowledge
on how to set it up.
So it's got to make 14%
year?in, year?out.
Otherwise, there's no incentive
for them to do this.
You're nowhere near that yet.
You have to get
all that worked out
so that I am so interested
in doing this
that it's made easy for me.
I write you the $25,000
so my 10 tables arrive,
my paddles arrive,
my balls arrive.
So, you're saying
you could do it on your own?
This just put me
to sleep.
No, I'm not.
I'm just saying ??
He's right, though.
He's exactly right.
It's not gonna work.
It's not franchisable yet.
No, the numbers ??
Okay, not only that ??
Do you have
more than one unit yet?
So, we had just signed a lease
for our second unit.
That's gonna be going up in
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Did you franchise it?
Do you guys own it?
This is
a corporate location.
What capital did you have to
spend to set it up? How much?
We're setting that up
with a $1 million budget.
A $1 million budget?
Yes.
So, we're building our second
location to be a showroom,
a flagship, a training center
for our franchisees.
We're not building this
as the cookie?cutter
and that'll go out.
Exactly, guys.
And that's a big part
of the point. You're too early.
You haven't proved
that you can run
a multi?unit environment
yet,
you haven't proved that
you can make enough money
to support a franchise fee
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
John: Okay, guys.
I love the story,
I love the drink,
I <i>hate</i> ping pong.
I'm out.
[ Both chuckle ]
O'Leary: Wow.
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you.
Thanks for the drink,
though.
You know, honestly,
I love ping pong.
I think it's really fun.
But I agree with Kevin.
I think
it's way too early.
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Michael:
Well, it seems early to you,
but all of you
are entrepreneurs.
You've all
built businesses.
You all had to say yes to things
that you weren't yet ready for.
You all had to take
that leap of faith.
Yeah.
Cuban: But you do that
as an entrepreneur,
not necessarily
as an investor.
That's the challenge.
It's not that we don't
think you can do it.
But you haven't shown
that it's replicable yet.
Basically, you're telling me
I got to spend $1 million ??
that's what you're doing
on your store.
The million is for the showroom,
the flagship.
I know, but that's
a really bad showroom.
It shows me
it's a bad franchise.
It's bigger than what it needs
to be because we're gonna be
training our franchisees.
Well,
why are you doing that?
And what we're doing is,
we're trying to bring
people together.
You have to tell me
as a franchisee
I'm gonna make 20% on it.
Now I'm interested
in Pips &amp; Bounce.
But you're not telling me
that at all.
You don't have that model
worked out yet.
Guys, the numbers
are very, very bad.
Not weak, but terrible.
Sharapova: I'm intrigued.
I like the concept
of going somewhere
and not just
going there to eat.
I like the activity element.
I mean, you see the ice cream
museum doing experiences,
you see the escape rooms,
so people are paying for that.
It's definitely
a proof of concept.
But I wish there was
a little bit more there.
Sorry ?? I'm out.
So, think about it this way.
Ping pong has been around for ??
How much of your own money
have you put into this?
So, we've bet every dollar
that we have.
How much is that?
We put in $300,000.
And why do you think
it's worth $5 million today?
The way we look at it is,
over 100 units,
which is a conservative estimate
over the 150 units
of metropolitan statistical
areas we can address ??
But you have one unit.
We're valuing
the franchise business.
We're not valuing
our unit.
Oh, I have to punish you.
I have to punish you.
[ Laughter ]
I knew that was coming.
I'm holding back.
That's a big, big step forward,
yeah.
Please hold me back!
We look at a net present value
of over $100,000 per location.
[ Laughs ]
Guys, come on.
Mark, what would you approach
our valuation at?
What is it worth, and how can we
grow this together?
You're not ready
to franchise.
If you and I invest
in Pips &amp; Bounce
to start off
the whole thing, right,
and you said, "Mark,
should we franchise yet?" ??
you know what my answer
would be?
Hell no!
'Cause you're not
ready yet.
[ Laughs ]
So if one of my friends
came to me and said,
"Mark, Pips &amp; Bounce,
you're an investor, right?
You love the place.
We went there.
We had so much fun!
Should I buy a franchise?" ??
you know what
my answer would be?
Tell them, Maria.
Hell no!
Exactly.
Only, I'd be louder.
[ Laughs ]
You get my point.
O'Leary:
What's it worth to buy out
$70,000 cash flow
from a retail operator?
Probably four
or five times that.
That's all you're worth.
So you're miles from
5 million bucks.
Presentation was horrible.
You're nice guys.
I hate this a lot.
I'm out.
[ Cuban laughs ]
Well, you know, look ??
I think we're all out,
guys.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
?Yeah. Good luck, guys.
?Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Wow.
Michael:
You know, if we can count
every time
someone said no to us ??
every bank,
every investor,
every accountant
who said no to us ??
we wouldn't be here.
What, five more nos?
We can take it.
Yeah.
