We're from San Francisco,
California,
Joe:
Look at this poor dad.
Why can't traveling
with kids be easier?
Fran:
Well, now, you can have all this
delivered straight to your door!
Joe: We offer everything from
full?size cribs, car seats,
So, Fran, I have
13?month?old twins.
Oh, I know!
That's great.
It is ?? It is
an adventure to travel.
Exactly.
What does it cost on average?
Like, how much
is a double stroller?
Probably $15 to $20 a day
depending on the market.
So, you've got to ship it
to wherever the location is?
No. Our secret sauce,
we have 500 providers.
If I'm the provider,
am I saying,
"I'm gonna rent that
out for $30,"
or are you setting
the price?
Our providers set
their own prices.
The providers
pick their own pricing?
?So it's not a set menu?
?No, no, no.
We are a marketplace
for baby gear rentals.
I've never heard of this.
Like, every time I go ??
What do you take
from the transaction?
We take 24%.
?24%?
?24%?
?Greiner: Wow.
Yipee?yi?yo?ki?yay.
That's really healthy.
This is so we can build
a business that will scale,
that will grow,
Lake:
What's your background, Joe?
I'm an engineer.
I've kind of been an adviser
to my mom over here.
The tech needed a lot of work
I'm in San Francisco.
I'm a female founder.
Come on,
we need some support.
Uh...I have a couple challenges
with this.
Like, the marketplace works
when you're looking
at a huge market opportunity.
There's gonna be tons
of transactions,
Herjavec:
Fran, you got Kevin left,
What do you say, Fran?
No, I don't think so.
10%.
No.
10% with some other
sort of deal.
You're getting closer.
I can't do 20%.
You're still a startup.
You're still ??
But I can't have it
wipe up all my notes.
Why is that <i>my</i> fault?
?I get diluted to 30%.
?But why is that my fault?
Get him, Fran!
Get him!
?Greiner: Come on, get him!
?Fran ?? Fran ??
Don't you ?? Don't you want me?
Don't you want me?
Baby?
[ Laughter ]
Come on.
Fran, I have to feel loved.
Good for you,
hold your ground, Fran.
Congratulations, guys.
?Congrats.
?Thank you.
?Good luck to you guys.
?Bye.
?Fran.
I'm out.

Greiner: Bye.
