I was born and raised
in San Francisco.
My mom is an immigrant
from Japan,
and my dad is from Minnesota,
so I grew up in a very vibrant,
bilingual,
bicultural household.
Growing up, I always thought
I wanted to be a doctor.
I went to Stanford,
I was pre?med,
but ultimately decided that
wasn't for me.
After college, I got a job
at a consulting firm
working in e?commerce.
I really fell in love
with retail,
and I think in particular,
apparel retail.
I felt like there
was no technology
that really was being applied
to help make the category
better.
At Stitch Fix, we take this idea
of personal styling,
and we make it
accessible to all.
We get to know our clients
through a style profile
which you can fill out online.
Based on that, our stylists
are able to get to know you
and send you products
specifically curated
just for you to try on
in the comfort of your home.
Simply keep what you want,
send back what you don't want,
and get
this great personal experience
for the whole household.
Combining data science
and styling
was really not something that
people had done before.
Fundraising was really
difficult.
Over 50 venture investors said
no to me.
Being a female business leader
in Silicon Valley,
you don't always feel like
your voice is heard.
It's really male?dominated.
I wasn't always obvious,
where people thought, "Oh, yes,
of course she's gonna be
a public company CEO someday."
In early 2011,
we got our first commitment
from a venture investor,
Steve Anderson,
and that was really when we were
off to the races.
[ Cheers and applause ]
The stock has opened.
This crowd is excited.
You can see Katrina Lake
over there with her crew.
Lake: In 2017,
we took the company public.
At the time, I was the youngest
female founder/CEO
to take a company public ever.
I was up there with my family
and my son,
who was one at the time,
and I think it was really
a symbol of what's possible
being a parent and being able to
prioritize parenthood
and your business
at the same time.
Stitch Fix today is a company
with over $1 billion in sales.
We have over 3 million clients
across the whole country,
and we have
over 6,000 employees.
I've watched "Shark Tank"
for years,
and I love that it showcases
all kinds of entrepreneurs.
It's such an important part
of helping people to see
that entrepreneurship is not
available to only a select few.
What I love about
entrepreneurship
is the optimism.
You're believing in something
that lots of people
don't believe in,
and you are taking a point
of view
that's not a common
point of view,
and that optimism is super
infectious, really energizing.
It's an environment
I love being in.
Hi, Sharks, I'm Joe Maier,
and this is my mom, Fran Maier.
We're from San Francisco,
California,
and we're seeking $500,000 for
5% equity in our business...
?Oh, wow!
?BabyQuip!
Sharks, everyone knows that
when you travel with kids,
the amount of baggage you have
to lug around can be insane.
Oh.
You need a pack mule just to
carry this crazy amount of gear.
But the problem is
a pack mule
is pretty hard to come by
nowadays.
So, what happens?
The parent
becomes the pack mule.
[ Light laughter ]
Joe:
Look at this poor dad.
Why can't traveling
with kids be easier?
Fran:
Well, now, you can have all this
delivered straight to your door!
Joe: We offer everything from
full?size cribs, car seats,
high chairs, toy boxes,
and more.
You name it, we got it.
Simply log onto
our website,
enter your destination
and travel dates...
Choose one of our local
providers to rent from.
From there, simply select
any of our clean, safe...
[ Laughter ]
...and insured baby gear.
And it's literally
as easy as that.
Once you arrive
at your destination,
our providers will deliver your
equipment right to your door.
With BabyQuip, we say
leave that baggage behind.
So, Sharks, it's time
to pack up this mule
and get him out of here.
[ Laughter ]
So, Fran, I have
13?month?old twins.
Oh, I know!
That's great.
It is ?? It is
an adventure to travel.
Exactly.
What does it cost on average?
Like, how much
is a double stroller?
Probably $15 to $20 a day
depending on the market.
So, you've got to ship it
to wherever the location is?
No. Our secret sauce,
we have 500 providers.
If I'm the provider,
am I saying,
"I'm gonna rent that
out for $30,"
or are you setting
the price?
Our providers set
their own prices.
The providers
pick their own pricing?
?So it's not a set menu?
?No, no, no.
We are a marketplace
for baby gear rentals.
I've never heard of this.
Like, every time I go ??
What do you take
from the transaction?
We take 24%.
?24%?
?24%?
?Greiner: Wow.
Yipee?yi?yo?ki?yay.
That's really healthy.
This is so we can build
a business that will scale,
that will grow,
and we put more than one
provider in every market.
Okay, so,
let's go right into sales.
Now that I'm going 24%,
which I like.
Mr. Wonderful likes that.
?Good.
We started this business
in the middle of 2016.
Since then, we've done
$3.7 million in gross revenue.
?Wow.
?That's top line.
?What's your percentage?
?We keep about 24% of that.
Not quite a million
on the $3.7 million.
What about investors?
Um, so we've raised
$2.4 million to date
on a valuation of $8 million.
?Oh.
?What?
?Wow.
What do you need
the money for?
[ Chuckles ]
We need the money
to continue our growth,
grow awareness.
This last bunch of money
will get us to profitability
next year.
And tell us about you.
Tell us about your background.
So, I'm a serial
entrepreneur.
My first startup was Match.
?Match? Wow.
?Match.com?
Match.com!
?Online dating.
?Come on! High five.
?All right, thank you.
?Wow.
Congratulations.
?Uh, hey, guess what ??
?What?
We sold it for way too little,
way too early.
Cuban:
What did you sell it for?
Less than $8 million.
And it's a long
story short ??
You sold Match for less than $8?
It's a long story.
?Hey, listen, a lesson learned.
?It was pre?Internet, though.
You sold it kind of like
pre?Internet.
Yeah, we didn't know, Mark,
how good we had it.
We weren't quite as smart
as you were.
Lake:
What's your background, Joe?
I'm an engineer.
I've kind of been an adviser
to my mom over here.
The tech needed a lot of work
and needed something
that could really scale,
but the value in our company
isn't the technology.
The value is really
our providers.
90% of our providers are
stay?at?home moms
looking for a side hustle.
They are super passionate.
They're always sharing ideas.
I mean, I love this part.
I think, at Stitch Fix, some of
the magic of our business
is in the stylists,
which is a very similar model.
Right.
How much are you paying to
acquire on each side?
Okay, so, we are acquiring
a customer for about $22, $24.
But you also pay to acquire
on the provider side.
Is that right?
?Right. They cost $115.
Their value to us is
really in the thousands.
I have some
who haven't even left.
What does your data tell you
the typical use case?
Is it a family traveling
in a hotel?
Our data shows that the biggest
segment are private residences.
?Really?
?These are mostly grandparents.
They really like the service
that we're providing.
A third of our business
is vacation rentals,
and that's up
from being 20?something percent.
?How long do they rent for?
?It seems so logical to me
in the vacation rental space.
Yeah.
Really strategic.
I'm really surprised
because the scale issue ??
to your point,
you got to be national.
I don't know
if you can get big
unless you have
a national brand,
like a hotel chain
supporting you.
The route you're going down
seems super risky to me.
It's a great idea. I wish it was
corporate?oriented.
I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
So, you are unbelievable to me.
I love this business.
Which, yes, you can tell,
and it's infectious.
But for me, I'm still
a little bit confused
about how all of this works.
At this moment, I just don't
think I understand it enough
to buy in,
and so I'm sorry, I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Guys, you have
the exact same problem
as any ride?sharing service.
You got to spend $100
per provider to acquire them,
then you have to go out
and you have to build your brand
so that people call you,
then you have all
this territory to cover.
It's not that ??
?We're doing it, Mark.
You're not, though.
To get to where you are doing
100,000 transactions a month,
where you're making
real money,
you're gonna
have to continue
to raise a lot of money
after that.
$5 million ??
?I think we're profitable
after $500,000 more,
and my ??
You may be cash flow
break even,
but you're gonna have to deal
with that equilibrium
having enough providers, making
sure they make enough money,
spending enough on marketing to
generate enough transactions.
That's the challenge
for this business,
and those are
the reasons I'm out.
I'm in San Francisco.
I'm a female founder.
Come on,
we need some support.
Uh...I have a couple challenges
with this.
Like, the marketplace works
when you're looking
at a huge market opportunity.
There's gonna be tons
of transactions,
and I can take a relatively
small percentage,
and the math works.
Here, you know, I think
the 24% is great today.
Once you start introducing
partnerships ??
Well, we get
other stuff, yeah.
Once you start introducing more,
is it still gonna be 24%?
I don't know.
How big is the market?
I don't know.
I think it's just
too risky for me.
Unfortunately, I'm out.
Thank you.
Herjavec:
Fran, you got Kevin left,
and God knows he needs
a side hustle.
?I know. Come on, Kevin.
?Good luck with that.
Look, I am not like
any of your other investors.
I'm Mr. Wonderful,
and I'm way more valuable
than a random VC,
not that these
aren't wonderful people,
but they're not a Shark.
Right. Right.
Is there
an offer coming?
I'm just helping you
get over the hump.
Take a deep breath.
?Get ready.
Want to roll the drums?
[ Imitates drum roll ]
I'll give you
the $500,000...
20%.
?Ooh.
Cuban: Oh, is that all?
That's nothing for you.
I respect the fact that
you've raised money already,
but you are so far
from being worth $10 million.
How would
you make that deal?
Would you make it on
a convertible note?
Nope.
[ Laughter ]
'Cause if you made it on
a convertible note,
then that wouldn't
knock out all of my ??
I know
exactly how that works.
Come on, that's fair.
Are you willing
to take 20% dilution?
What do you say, Fran?
No, I don't think so.
10%.
No.
10% with some other
sort of deal.
You're getting closer.
I can't do 20%.
You're still a startup.
You're still ??
But I can't have it
wipe up all my notes.
Why is that <i>my</i> fault?
?I get diluted to 30%.
?But why is that my fault?
And you don't want me to be
diluted to 30%.
You decided to ask for $500,000,
and then you say to me,
"I'll give you half a million
dollars for 5%"?
That ??
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm willing to talk about it,
but 20% ??
?And we are talking.
?[ Chuckles ]
Get him, Fran!
Get him!
?Greiner: Come on, get him!
?Fran ?? Fran ??
Don't you ?? Don't you want me?
Don't you want me?
Baby?
[ Laughter ]
Come on.
Fran, I have to feel loved.
I have to feel the love.
And the love is ??
This is making me
uncomfortable.
[ Laughter ]
?Come on, Kevin.
?I'm taking inordinate risk.
I'm giving you
half a million bucks.
I'm giving you a solid
opportunity.
Come in
on a convertible note.
I don't have to do them.
That's the whole point.
I get what I want.
All right.
20%?
Can't do it.
Oh.
Cuban:
Way to stand your ground.
Good for you,
hold your ground, Fran.
Congratulations, guys.
?Congrats.
?Thank you.
?Good luck to you guys.
?Bye.
?Fran.
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?See you guys.
Greiner: Bye.
