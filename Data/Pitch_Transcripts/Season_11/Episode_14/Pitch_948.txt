Lake: So, Lindsay,
so this was me.
So, I travel a ton, I had the
exact same epiphany of just,
like, "What are all these
chemicals in the toothpaste?"
I went down this rabbit hole.
I don't think I found you guys,
but I found
a tablet?based toothpaste,
I wanted to speak
to how it tastes ??
Lindsay, I just learned
from Katrina here
that there's competition.
There's lots of other people
doing this, right?
McCormick: There's a few
on the market.
The form of toothpaste
in a tablet is not new.
What is new about ours is
that it comes in glass bottles,
Lindsay,
do you guys have sales?
Uh, we're on our way
to $1.3 million.
?Oh, that's good.
?Wow.
?Boom goes the dynamite!
?In 10 months.
?Yes.
?Wow.
So, when I came up with it,
I figured no one would buy it,
but I knew I wanted it,
Lindsay, you have something
really rare
that very few people come in
here with these kind of sales.
You own 100% of the company.
?Yeah.
There's no
shareholder advisers.
I know, so that's
why this is a big deal.
