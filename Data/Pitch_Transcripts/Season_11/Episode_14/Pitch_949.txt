Hey, Sharks,
I'm Nathan Kondamuri.
And I'm Sophia Edelstein.
We're from
New York City,
and we're the co?founders
of Pair Eyewear.
When I was a kid,
I hated wearing my glasses.
I mean, let's face it,
there's nothing fun,
fashionable, or exciting
about the entire process.
Not to mention parents have to
shell out a fortune
for something their kids
don't even want to wear.
That's why we decided
to innovate
the entire eyewear experience
and take it
to a whole new level.
Introducing Pair Eyewear,
the first?ever continually
customizable glasses
where kids can...
All: Swap the top!
[ Laughter ]
Our patent?pending
magnetic technology
allows kids to easily swap on
any of our ??
?Cool.
?Very cool.
?Wow.
?Oh, wow.
Yeah, any
of our full range
of fun, hip,
and dynamic frame tops.
Designed to mold
to any personality,
we've created the perfect pair
of glasses for kids,
all for a fraction
of the price
of those
big?box retailers.
And now, as the biggest
Dallas Mavericks fan,
you know John is gonna
swap on that blue top
to rep his team
for the big game.
Yeah, boy!
And after choosing
her favorite polka?dot top,
you know Annie's ready to dance
in style for her ballet recital.
In less than a year
since launching,
we've started a glasses
revolution
where kids everywhere are saying
goodbye to their boring frames
and hello
to their parents.
We're raising $400,000
for 10% in our company.
So, Sharks, which one of you
wants to pair up with us and...
All: Swap the Top?!
?[ Laughs ]
?We've got some samples for you.
Cool. Good job, guys.
Thank you very much.
I like your glasses.
Thank you.
How do the glasses feel?
They're very comfortable,
and they're light.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Edelstein: Amazing job, guys.
You guys did so well.
See you guys later.
?Good job, guys.
Kondamuri: So, huge margins
on the tops.
We have 70% margins on both
the bases and the tops.
?And how do you sell them?
?That's fabulous.
Where do I buy them?
Everything is sold directly
online right now,
which is something
really different
in the glasses space
for parents and kids
because before, parents had to
bring their kids
kicking and screaming
to the optical store.
But through Pair, it's so easy
that you can do it
sitting on the couch from
the comfort of your iPhone.
I understand in
the eyeglass industry,
there's one Italian company
that has 80% share.
In Market Square, there's a
dominant player with 80% share.
Innovation comes
from people like you.
?Yeah.
?And as soon as they prove it
in the market with, you know,
some critical mass,
a few million in sales,
they knock it off
and crush you
like a cockroach.
Why are you ever going to
get scale
in a market that has
an 80% share behemoth in it?
Something that's unique about
the eyewear industry
is that these behemoths don't
actually innovate at all.
I agree.
They wait for you to do it.
Then they acquire you,
hopefully.
And then they acquire ??
Or they may not be interested
in the kids market.
Guys, how much money
have you raised?
Tell us
about your investors.
So, we began by bootstrapping
the business
while we were
in college.
We had to reach out
to some family and friends
to get
some prototypes made.
We raised $150,000.
Congrats. Then what?
We beta tested with
around 75 families
to get feedback
on how the product worked,
how the frames worked
for kids...
?Great.
?That's great.
...and that's when we began
to think about
how we would launch this brand,
how would we go to market.
Did you raise more money?
We raised $1 million
at that time...
?Wow.
?...at a $4 million valuation.
And then the million
you raised,
was it from big
equity firms or individuals?
It was from a couple
of venture capital firms.
You know, nobody's asked you
if you have any sales.
Yes, so we have $100,000 of
sales in the last eight months.
Cuban:
Okay, so, wait, wait, wait.
What were your sales
last month?
How many actual customers
did you have?
Last month was
$15,000 in sales.
15? One?five?
?Yes, $15,000.
?That's horrible.
So, we basically used
the marketing spend
to acquire customers,
but we've only spent $50,000
on actual marketing spend
to acquire $100,000.
Well, how much money
do you have left?
I'm just nervous
about how much capital
you have left
in the bank.
We have $150,000
left in the bank.
That's something
to be nervous about.
What have you spent it on?
Kondamuri:
So, a third of that million was
spent on product development,
a third was operations,
and a third was legal,
FDA patents.
How much do you have in
inventory at cost right now?
$150,000.
Oh!
Kondamuri: So, we have a good
amount because we wanted
to build up the product,
but then once we had
the customer acquisition cost
where we wanted it,
to start scaling.
Herjavec:
Look, my overwhelming view,
and I hate to say it
because you're so positive,
I'm not sure I see it as
a standalone company.
I almost see it as a feature.
Just my gut feeling.
I'm sorry, I'm out.
for a 10% stake in Sophia and
Nathan's eyeglass company, Pair.
We think you guys will be
incredible partners.
We know a royalty is tough
as a cash?strapped business,
and we want to invest
all of our cash
back into growing revenues,
growing customers,
so we all get that better,
bigger outcome.
See? They are smart.
Would you guys be willing
to do 10% for the 400K
and 2% advisory shares?
We want you guys on as advisers,
we want your guys's input.
Wow.
You know, not all money and not
all advisers are the same.
Yeah, I think there's ??
We really want to make sure
that you guys have the time
and space
to not be penny?wise,
pound?foolish.
I built a business that's over
a billion in sales now.
I did it
with very little capital.
Like, you're talking about being
in a cash?strapped environment?
I've been there.
So, you know, we think this is
a really fair offer.
We think we can really do a lot
to accelerate your business,
and we'd love
to work with you.
Um, we know that.
Unfortunately, we won't be able
to take any royalty deal
just because ??
But the thing is we feel ??
'Cause, you know,
you saw we talked a while ??
Katrina, Lori,
they've said no to you
seven times
in different ways.
They're not gonna
give you royalties.
Kondamuri: We want to work
with you guys.
We just know a royalty
is so difficult.
Look, we respect the fact that
you're sticking to your guns.
We'd love to work
with you here,
but respect you
if you want to walk away.
Edelstein: That could not
have gone better.
They're both incredible
entrepreneurs,
and we can't wait to grow
this business with them.
I'm feeling so lucky.
Mm?hmm.
Welcome to the royalty.
[ Laughs ]
Welcome to royalty.
