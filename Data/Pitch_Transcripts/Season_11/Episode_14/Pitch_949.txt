?Hi, Sharks, I'm Lindsay.
?And I'm Asher.
And our company
is Bite Toothpaste Bits.
We're asking for $325,000
for 5% of our company.
Wow.
People first used to brush
their teeth with this ??
Ox hooves and bones.
Mmm! And then in the 1800s,
we started using this ??
?Eggshells and soap.
?A little better.
And then, in 1886, there was
a major innovation ??
the first toothpaste tube
was invented.
And after 150 years, toothpaste
hasn't really changed.
And why?
Toothpaste sucks.
Sharks, we are swimming
in plastic.
About 1 billion
plastic toothpaste tubes
end up in our landfills and
our oceans every single year,
and even though people care more
about what they're putting
in their bodies now, most
toothpastes are still filled
with things like artificial
flavors and preservatives.
And that's not good because
we swallow 5% to 7%
of our toothpaste every single
time we brush our teeth,
or 1.4 gallons over the course
of your lifetime.
Bite Toothpaste Bits
are dry tablets
that are not only good
for your teeth,
they're good for our bodies
and the planet.
And our bits come in glass jars
that are fully recyclable,
but they're meant
to be kept and refilled
with our compostable
refill packets.
Meaning no more plastic
toothpaste tubes in landfills.
It's as easy as bite,
brush, repeat.
Big paste is on a race
to the bottom.
And they've gotten away
with gunking up our bodies
and our planet
for far too long.
So, Sharks...
Who's ready to take a bite
out of big paste with us?
How does it work?
You all have jars
in front of you.
You just pop a bit
in your mouth, you bite down,
and you start brushing
with a wet toothbrush,
and it's gonna foam
up like magic.
There you go! There you go,
there you go, there you go.
I've brushed before.
So, our tablets...
[ Laughs ]
...they're flavored with
natural mint peppermint oil.
?[ Gurgling ]
?[ Laughs ]
Lori, your face
is priceless.
[ Laughs ]
So, is the goal here because
the toothpaste
isn't as healthy for me
as your product,
or are you just trying to get
rid of the plastic?
Well, it's two?fold.
So, when I created this,
I was traveling
full time for work,
and I went through those
little toothpaste tubes,
and I was like,
"This is so wasteful."
So I started looking
into alternatives,
and that's when I learned
about all
of the really nasty chemicals
that's in most toothpastes,
and I was like, "I don't want
those in my body."
So I started looking into
how I can make my own.
I'm not a dentist,
and I'm not a chemist,
so I made friends with them.
?[ Laughs ]
I talked to every dentist
and every dental hygienist
I possibly could, I took
online chemistry classes,
and I tried almost
100 different ingredients,
putting together our formula
that we use in our tablets.
And she was hand?cranking these
in our living room.
?[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
?Seriously?
Are you married?
Yeah, well, we've been dating
for six years.
Want me to marry you now?
[ Laughs ]
?You know, I do that.
?I heard you're ordained.
Yeah, it's true.
'Cause I'm just wondering,
six years, like,
let's get going here.
?Yeah, exactly.
?We got companies to build.
Lake: So, Lindsay,
so this was me.
So, I travel a ton, I had the
exact same epiphany of just,
like, "What are all these
chemicals in the toothpaste?"
I went down this rabbit hole.
I don't think I found you guys,
but I found
a tablet?based toothpaste,
and the dentist told me,
"Don't use that,
it doesn't have fluoride,
and you need fluoride."
?Right.
?Ohh.
We're actually in development
with a fluoride line.
We are in the middle of testing
right now,
and we will be seeking
ADA approval,
and we will be the only
fluorinated tablet
on the market in the U. S.
I wanted to speak
to how it tastes ??
Lindsay, I just learned
from Katrina here
that there's competition.
There's lots of other people
doing this, right?
McCormick: There's a few
on the market.
The form of toothpaste
in a tablet is not new.
What is new about ours is
that it comes in glass bottles,
compostable refill packets,
and we're 100% palm oil free.
Lindsay,
do you guys have sales?
Uh, we're on our way
to $1.3 million.
?Oh, that's good.
?Wow.
?Boom goes the dynamite!
?In 10 months.
?Yes.
?Wow.
So, when I came up with it,
I figured no one would buy it,
but I knew I wanted it,
and that would be great,
and that's enough.
So, I built this site
on Shopify,
and then a popular women's
magazine was like,
"We would like to, you know,
showcase this."
So, we took ??
It was like an iPhone video,
like, you know,
me brushing my teeth.
Within a day,
it was like 2 million views.
?That's amazing.
?Have you taken any money?
?Zero dollars raised.
?And no debt.
Yeah.
What do you sell it for?
What does it cost you?
Uh, the 1?ounce bottle,
which is our 1?month,
that costs $12
plus shipping.
Um, for the 4?month, that's $30,
shipping is included.
That is a subscription.
What's your cost on this?
Our cost on that, shipped,
is about $3.50.
?Wow!
?Yeah.
?Wow.
?All right, guys, look,
all of the Sharks
here over a decade...
Yeah.
...have learned that
when they get a hit
that is a non?proprietary
consumer good...
Right.
...they get
knocked off el pronto
by many, many, many knock?offs.
?So, we already had ??
I think something's that's
also pretty extraordinary,
it's our customers.
They are very vocal.
So, my first version of these
had a small amount of palm oil,
and our customers
were like,
"Hey, you have palm oil
in your formula.
What is this?"
And I was like,
"Oh, wow, you're right.
Palm oil is responsible
for the devastation
of the rainforests
in Indonesia
and the orangutan population,
and that doesn't
align with our values."
So, we completely reformulated
our entire line
within four months.
Once we did that, our sales
doubled that month,
and they've continued
to climb.
That's great, you're listening
to your customers.
?You're just online?
?Yes.
You're 100% online?
We are entirely
direct?to?consumer right now.
How many subscribers do you
have? What's your churn?
Yeah, so we have just
under 10,000 subscribers.
That's great.
You know your customer
acquisition cost now?
Yeah, our customer acquisition
cost, blended, is about $4.50,
and our AOV is close to $27.
?That's great.
?That's nice.
[ Chuckles ]
Can you keep this run up
with these phenomenal
customer acquisition margins?
Because they're great.
What you've done is amazing.
When there's nothing
proprietary,
and when you get a full?fledged
binge of knock?offs,
I think your customer
acquisition goes up
and your margins go down,
and then all of a sudden,
it's a real cat fight.
Consumers are becoming
incredibly conscious,
and they're looking
for products
that are truly trying
to make a difference.
But it's our base that is
fanatical about us
that will help us
continue to grow ??
Look, I can't think
of a more competitive shelf.
It's more competitive than
pretty well anything else
in terms of just linear foot,
gross margin,
the fighting it out,
all that stuff.
And especially
with that backdrop,
I mean, what you guys have done
is amazing.
And doing this
all bootstrapped
and in this short period
of time,
and the product is awesome,
and the packaging is great,
and the brand is great.
But I think this is
a really crowded space
and potentially getting
even more crowded.
I wish you guys had
fluoride in the formulation.
So, with that, I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
I guess I'm sitting here,
I'm thinking,
"How can ?? How can ??"
You're only offering me 5%
for $325,000.
Like, where do I fit?
Maybe this isn't a business
that needs funding right now.
We don't want dumb money.
We've had institutional
investors approach us.
We look at all of you guys
that are up here,
and we want a Shark.
Look, not in a million years
would I do it for 5%.
I'm out.
I'd do the $325,000 for 20%.
$325,000 for 20%.
Thank you for your offer,
first of all.
Yeah.
I'll tell my reasons why,
listen.
I'm just telling you right now,
what I look at
is risk versus reward,
and I think the margins
a year from now will be
significantly less,
and your customer acquisition
costs will be higher, too.
You know,
using the "Shark Tank" platform
in a consumer product like this
is fantastic,
but it doesn't make you
impervious to competition.
It just brings in
a lot of knock?offs.
That's my offer.
I'll give you $325,000 for 20%.
Well, listen, I usually find
that the most successful people
have the strongest principles.
They believe in something
so much that it drives them,
and clearly you have that.
But I'm really kind of
on the fence about this.
I tend to follow my gut, and
I think here, I'm gonna go out.
Thank you.
Mark?
Guys, I love it when there's
a stodgy old industry,
and somebody walks in and says,
"Let's just turn this
upside down."
Are you guys selling
on Amazon at all?
Hunt: We experimented with it,
and we took it off.
Because?
Because we just
wanted to focus on building
our relationships with our
customers direct to consumer.
But that's where your
knock?offs can take root.
Yes, we would definitely
consider going back on Amazon.
When you run
with the elephants,
there's the quick
and the dead, right?
Right. We've stayed away from
Amazon because of that.
However, our customers are
looking for us on Amazon.
On Amazon, exactly.
And we should be there
for them.
So, guys,
I'll make you an offer.
Asher and Lindsay are seeking
$325,000
for 5% of their toothpaste
tablet company, Bite.
Kevin has offered $325,000
for 20% of the company,
but Mark is also interested.
So, I'll give you the 325K,
but I need 15%.
Lindsay, you have something
really rare
that very few people come in
here with these kind of sales.
You own 100% of the company.
?Yeah.
There's no
shareholder advisers.
I know, so that's
why this is a big deal.
?And it should be a big deal.
?That's why I'm like, "Man,
Mark, I want to work with you,
but this is a lot."
Herjavec: But it also means
you have the flexibility.
He's at 15%, you're at 7%.
So 15%, okay.
