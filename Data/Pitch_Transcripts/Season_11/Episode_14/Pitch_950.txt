Hi, Sharks.
My name is Frankie Yamsuan.
I'm seeking $180,000 for 18%
of my company, Coconut Girl.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't know about you, Sharks,
but I love summertime.
There is nothing better
than relaxing by the beach
with some creamy ice cream.
But let's be honest,
these sweet treats
don't really help the waistline,
especially during bikini season.
?[ Laughs ]
?Thank you, Frankie.
You're welcome.
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you, Frankie,
AKA Coconut Girl.
?You're welcome.
?Feed me.
Come on, Frankie, you should've
come down here first.
?[ Laughs ]
?Greiner: I have chocolate.
?Saved the best for last.
?Thank you.
?We have one of each, right?
?Feed me.
Yamsuan: Yes. So, you have
all three flavors,
O'Leary:
So, Frankie, this is no dairy?
No dairy,
made with coconut milk.
So, isn't the compromise
heavy?duty calories?
?Not more than ice cream.
?With my products,
my main focus is
the good?for?you ingredients.
So, this is why I created it.
So, Frankie, you said
this is for the beach,
So, how many calories,
Frankie?
250, right?
The package
that Mark is holding.
?250?
?Yes.
So, this is actually rather
large for 250 calories,
but with healthy ingredients.
Frankie,
what are your sales?
Yes, so, this is year 3
for me being in retail.
Last year, I did $120,000.
The year before, I did $60,000.
So, this year, I'm on track
to do $300,000.
Good for you.
How are you selling it?
Sell them
in big?box retail stores
just in Southern California
at the moment.
My packaging costs ??
?You know what, Frankie?
I'm hearing enough.
I love healthy foods, right?
It goes
really, really well.
I don't even want to hear what
these people have to say.
I'll give you the $180,000,
but I want 25%.
Oh, that's what
I was gonna offer.
But you got to tell me.
I don't even want to deal
with all these meatheads.
I like the deal, too.
I'm your customer.
Frankie, Frankie, you got to
decide right now.
If you want to listen to other
deals, I'm fine with that.
I want to respect Lori.
Okay, then I'm out.
Ohh!
[ Chuckles ]
I'll give you
one last chance, right?
You can take the chance to hear
what she's saying...
Oh, wow.
...or you can go
with Alyssa's Cookies ??
Are you willing
to go down, though?
To what?
O'Leary: You know,
I'll help you, Frankie.
I'll do it for 20%.
O'Leary: There she goes.
Bye, Frankie.
Greiner:
Well, Frankie, congrats!
?Now give me my $5.
?I had a great offer.
[ Laughter ]
Yamsuan: They loved it,
and I'm so excited
to make this
the next household brand.
I wanted Mark Cuban
to be my Shark, my partner,
