Hi, Sharks.
My name is Frankie Yamsuan.
I'm seeking $180,000 for 18%
of my company, Coconut Girl.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't know about you, Sharks,
but I love summertime.
There is nothing better
than relaxing by the beach
with some creamy ice cream.
But let's be honest,
these sweet treats
don't really help the waistline,
especially during bikini season.
We all want to indulge
and treat ourselves
without compromising
our healthy lifestyles, right?
Well, that's why I created
Coconut Girl,
the best?tasting, dairy?free,
gluten?free
nice?cream sandwiches
that are out of this world.
Our guilt?free sandwiches
are made with all?natural,
good?for?you ingredients like
organic coconut milk,
honey, dates, and maple syrup.
So, Sharks, whether you're
bumming it on the beach
with our Beach Bum Maple...
[ Chuckles ]
...saying "Aloha"
to Aloha Chocolate...
Aloha.
...or want to hang 10
with our Hang Loose Vanilla,
Coconut Girl has any flavor
you're craving
to satisfy your sweet tooth,
and all without
any of the guilt.
Bring that over here.
Come on.
So, Sharks...
[ Laughter ]
...who's ready to take on
this sweet deal
and ride this wave
with Coconut Girl?
Me, me, me. Feed me.
Feed me.
?Ready?
?Pick us! Pick us!
Are you guys ready
for some ice cream?
?I'm so happy about this.
?Thank you.
No calories, right?
?[ Laughs ]
?Thank you, Frankie.
You're welcome.
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you, Frankie,
AKA Coconut Girl.
?You're welcome.
?Feed me.
Come on, Frankie, you should've
come down here first.
?[ Laughs ]
?Greiner: I have chocolate.
?Saved the best for last.
?Thank you.
?We have one of each, right?
?Feed me.
Yamsuan: Yes. So, you have
all three flavors,
and they all have
the same cookie,
which is made
out of almond butter.
Herjavec: Oh, my God.
It's my version of
chocolate chip cookie.
?This is amazing.
?Thank you.
And there's a crunch
to the cookie,
which is pure cocoa nibs,
no added sugar.
O'Leary:
So, Frankie, this is no dairy?
No dairy,
made with coconut milk.
So, isn't the compromise
heavy?duty calories?
?Not more than ice cream.
?With my products,
my main focus is
the good?for?you ingredients.
So, this is why I created it.
I was sick and tired
of the health food industry
lying about what's healthy,
the low fat, no fat, zero sugar,
but it was actually making me
sick and fat.
So, Frankie, you said
this is for the beach,
and when I put on my Speedo,
I got to look good.
[ Laughs ]
So, how many calories,
Frankie?
250, right?
The package
that Mark is holding.
?250?
?Yes.
So, this is actually rather
large for 250 calories,
but with healthy ingredients.
Yes. And the great thing
about my products, you know,
compared to the conventional
ice cream,
because of the nutritious
ingredients,
one sandwich will fill you up.
Frankie,
what are your sales?
Yes, so, this is year 3
for me being in retail.
Last year, I did $120,000.
The year before, I did $60,000.
So, this year, I'm on track
to do $300,000.
Good for you.
How are you selling it?
Sell them
in big?box retail stores
just in Southern California
at the moment.
And you have a co?packer
that does this?
Um, I did have a co?packer that
was producing the baking parts.
Um, they got really busy,
so now I'm back to square one,
and I'm full?on producing
everything on my own.
How are you gonna scale
this business
if you don't have
a co?packer?
Well, the main goal is to
obviously scale it up to there.
But I've made my products
really efficient.
When I first started
the company,
we actually used to do them
by pints,
and I saw a bunch
of my customers
making them
into ice cream sandwiches.
I was like, "That's brilliant,"
so I switched over and just
focused on the sandwiches.
How did you get into this?
What made you ??
I've always wanted to be
an entrepreneur.
You know, I was born
in the Philippines.
I came here when I was 5.
I saw my mother work two jobs
to give us an opportunity.
Um, you know, I struggled
specializing in one thing,
so I dropped out of UCLA,
but I was always passionate
about health and fitness.
I was always obsessed with
creating healthy alternatives
to everything that I loved,
the sweets that I missed.
And, you know, so I was just
doing it in my home kitchen,
and I realized there was
a business to it,
so thought of the name, and so
I created this icicle tricycle.
So, every weekend,
I would go to fitness events.
So, when a grocery store
approached me
and asked if I did
wholesale, I lied.
I said,
"Yeah, I do wholesale."
That's always
the right answer.
So I, you know,
went online,
and I figured out how to do
barcodes, nutrition labels.
I just learned on my own
and figured it out.
What stores are you in?
Whole Foods
is my biggest account.
How many locations?
Um, for Whole Foods, 30.
But we just got
the green light
to be in Hawaii, Nevada,
and Arizona.
And I just got picked up
by one of the biggest
natural food distributors
as of last week.
What do you sell it for, and
what does it cost you to make?
So, they retail for $4.99,
up to $5.49.
Is that expensive?
No, that's normal.
My biggest competitor, who
launched a dairy?free product,
actually upped their price
to match mine at $5.49.
?Oh, really?
?Yes.
But you didn't say how much
it costs you to make.
Oh, it costs me about $1.
?Just $1?
?Just $1, yes.
?Wow.
?And it's you doing everything?
I'm doing everything.
I have part?time help,
but that's why I'm here
asking for funding
because I need to get back
to what I'm good at,
which is the sales
and marketing,
and be the face of my brand.
You want to find somebody
to do logistics
and operations for you?
Yes.
How do you distribute this?
It's, like, a frozen product.
So, right now,
we were direct distributor
up until we got
picked up by UNFI.
So now, they pick up
from my facility,
and that's the reason why we're
now getting the green light
to be in Hawaii,
because they cover that region.
And how are you selling online?
Can you ship these?
I do not.
It's possible.
I have customers
all over New York ??
But with the dry ice
and everything,
it just gets really expensive.
?The dry ice
is just very costly right now,
and I don't have staff
to fulfill individual
orders.
So, we don't do direct
to consumers at the moment.
So, beyond hiring people, what
would you use the money for?
?To lower my food costs.
?Okay.
I'm confident that I can get it
down to 50 cents. So ??
?50 cents?
?50 cents.
My packaging costs ??
?You know what, Frankie?
I'm hearing enough.
I love healthy foods, right?
It goes
really, really well.
I don't even want to hear what
these people have to say.
I'll give you the $180,000,
but I want 25%.
Oh, that's what
I was gonna offer.
But you got to tell me.
I don't even want to deal
with all these meatheads.
I like the deal, too.
I'm your customer.
Frankie, Frankie, you got to
decide right now.
If you want to listen to other
deals, I'm fine with that.
I want to respect Lori.
Okay, then I'm out.
Ohh!
[ Chuckles ]
I'll give you
one last chance, right?
You can take the chance to hear
what she's saying...
Oh, wow.
...or you can go
with Alyssa's Cookies ??
Are you willing
to go down, though?
To what?
O'Leary: You know,
I'll help you, Frankie.
I'll do it for 20%.
And I'll squeeze Cuban's head
for you.
O'Leary: There she goes.
Bye, Frankie.
Greiner:
Well, Frankie, congrats!
?Now give me my $5.
?I had a great offer.
[ Laughter ]
Yamsuan: They loved it,
and I'm so excited
to make this
the next household brand.
I wanted Mark Cuban
to be my Shark, my partner,
and it's happening,
so I'm really excited.
