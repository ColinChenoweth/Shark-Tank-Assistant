Hey, Sharks.
My name is Bunim Laskin.
I am from Lakewood, New Jersey,
and I am seeking $300,000
in exchange
for 5% of my company...
Wow.
...Swimply.
Global warming.
Am I right, Sharks?
It's an epidemic
that is sweeping our planet.
The global surface temperature
is increasing
by over 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit
across the board,
and it's only going to
get hotter.
What if I told you
that I had a solution?
Introducing...
Swimply.
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: My God.
It's him?!
[ Laughs ]
Well, Sharks, maybe I haven't
found a solution
for global warming just yet.
But I did find an amazing way
for all of us to get together
and make the world
just a little bit cooler.
Swimply is the first?of?its?kind
online marketplace
for pool sharing,
where anyone can book
their own private pool
by the hour
whenever they want
from people who own a pool
but don't use it too often.
So, say you're like
my good friend Jesse.
Bunim, I'm worried you're going
to spontaneously combust.
Slow down.
No, I want to see
how much faster you can talk.
You said 900 hours?
Laskin: 900 hours were booked.
So, we get our first 100 pools,
then the website.
I didn't really have the funds
to keep the operation going.
I spent that summer using that
beta to just raise 960 grand.
Greiner: Whoa! Whoa!
960 grand?!
O'Leary: What?!
What?
So, a million in total?
?You raised $960,000?
?Yeah.
Wow!
O'Leary: What?
How much of the company
did you have to sell
to raise that much?
Mazel tov!
?[ Laughs ]
?How did you do that?
I raised it
at a $6 million valuation.
How did you do that?
Wow.
A pool?maintenance partnership
reached out to us, and ??
Pool?maintenance partnership?
A pool?maintenance company?
How interesting.
A pool?maintenance company that
has stores all over the country.
What have you booked
in hours, year?to?date?
In March 2019,
I raised 960 grand.
First thing we had to do
was develop
a proper website
that would scale.
So, this is your third time
trying to develop a proper
website, but go ahead.
This is really the first.
The first two times
were really a...
Yeah.
Yeah,
but they still count.
That was still 40 grand,
but go ahead.
Yeah. Okay.
We tried to build this app
and this website in three months
to get it out there
in time for summer.
To date,
there were malfunctions.
We got the product out there ??
Corcoran: Would you take
a minute?
I just have to take a breath.
[ Inhales sharply ]
Okay, go ahead.
[ Breathes sharply ]
So, this year to date,
we booked
individual 1,600 hours.
Greiner: So, that's a lot.
Herjavec: Can you walk us
through the financial model?
Laskin: Sure.
How much do you make,
what does the pool owner
charge?
Walk us through that.
Sure.
So, at the moment,
we let our host
charge whatever they'd like,
and then the hosts set limits.
So, some will have a 5% limit,
some will have a 25% limit,
and then they can set
additional fees
for every person
after a certain amount.
And how do you get paid
from that?
We have
a double?sided business model.
We take 15% commission
from the host,
and we charge the swimmer
an additional 10% service fee.
So 25% total?
25% total.
And how much have you made
year?to?date?
We did around $215,000 worth
of marketplace revenue.
That's net to you?
That's gross.
No, that's gross.
That's gross
marketplace revenue.
Our net
is around 20% of that.
So, you've made
$42,000 net revenue?
So, what's your dollar net?
Yes.
This is incredible.
You raised $1 million
for this idea.
Yeah.
That's very impressive.
Is that why you priced
the stock so very high?
Because based on your revenue,
it makes no sense.
So, it's a game of scale
and it's a game of promise
and it's a game of vision
right?
And that's exactly
what we're doing.
It's also a game of money.
Right.
Let me tell you
my thoughts, okay?
Okay.
I fly a lot,
and in the summer months,
when you fly over,
you will see pool after pool
after pool, and they're empty.
All these people own pools,
and there's nobody ever in them.
So I think that, in some ways,
you're really onto something,
but I just don't know
if I want to invest in this,
even though I think
there's a need.
So I'm sorry, I'm out.
Okay. Totally.
I have a couple of pragmatic
questions, alright?
When people show up, where do
they go to the bathroom?
When it comes to bathrooms,
hosts have two options.
Well ??
The two options they have ??
The people renting have
a third option ?? they
just pee in the pool.
Right now, 50% of our pools do
offer a way to use a side door.
But, Bunim, what's the second
option for bathrooms?
The second option
is not offering one.
But if you don't offer one,
aren't people gonna pee
in the pool?
I think Jesse's peeing
in the pool right now.
But they are. But ??
[ Laughter ]
I don't think
you've given a sense
of what someone's willing
to pay to use that pool.
Right.
And how many people
are paying?
Set us a range.
So, there's ?? Right.
Corcoran: And if I ??
So, I guess now
is a good time ??
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
And if I can couple
a second part of that question,
do your customers
typically come back
and reuse the pool
once a week,
or is it
a one?time event?
Okay, last year, the average
hour booked was $45 an hour.
This year,
the average was $90 an hour.
And how many people book it
for 100 bucks an hour?
Like, is there five
people coming over,
three people, two people?
So, last year, the average
amount of people per booking
was around 7.
This year, the average amount
of people per booking is 12.
I think the whole idea
is really nuts.
Maybe I'm not listening.
You're what we call
a fast talker in the business.
You think?
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
[ Laughs ]
I never met
anyone faster.
But I just don't get it.
So for all of those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
I can see
where this is a value.
You know, to get
12 friends together
and set up a party
at someone else's pool,
and it only cost me
300 or 400 bucks
for a Sunday fun day,
I can see that not being bad.
The challenge, though, is,
how many times can you do that?
How many kids can you get
to know about this
to throw parties together?
Right.
So, that comes down to how often
do people do this, right?
So, last year, when
the average price of the pool
was $50 an hour,
70% of our bookings
were families.
70% were families?
Wow.
In the beta.
Okay, what about 2019?
In 2019,
we had an issue.
This year,
we inserted Swimply Chat,
which allowed people
to facilitate pool parties
and stuff like that.
But the problem was, was that
we did run into technical issues
when it came
to notifying people,
that when you requested a pool
from somebody,
the person would approve it,
you wouldn't find out about it
for four hours.
That's a problem.
$300,000 for 5%.
That imputes
a $6 million valuation.
You're basically making
20 grand this year.
Around that, yeah.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy.
I know ??
Okay, it may upset me
and excite you
is the fact that we had
$675,000 worth of bookings
that went through the platform.
Let me modify that.
We only capitalized
on $150,000 of it.
I can take "kind of"
out of that sentence.
It's just plain crazy.
Okay.
The valuation's nuts.
No. I'm out.
[ Scoffs ]
Our projections
for next year, right?
Yeah.
We're breaking even.
This doesn't excite you?
Our projections
for the year afterwards
is we're profiting $15 million,
and that's just the U. S.
$50 million?
Is that your gross
or the overall ??
Our profits.
Your profit?
Our profits. Our gross by 2022
will be $289 million
in marketplace revenue
in the U. S. alone.
[ Laughs ]
Look, Bunim,
it's great to be excited,
right?
Mm?hmm.
It's great to be committed.
Every great entrepreneur
has to be.
But self?awareness has to be
a great trait, as well,
not lying to yourself.
Okay.
What we're talking about here
is that we took a product
this year,
we had three months to build.
As mentioned, there were
$675,000 worth of business
that went through the platform.
Only $150,000,
a little less than 20%,
actually was able to proceed,
and that is all, again,
not anecdotal.
This is product issues,
and it's something
that is easily solvable.
That doesn't mean
it scales.
What I'm saying is that
there is potential.
There were issues that were ??
We're a tech company ??
Yeah, but your price ??
We are a tech company, right?
Your potential and your reality
are in two different universes.
I'm out.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Mark, hear me out.
I'm 22.
Bunim, he's out.
He's out.
I'm 22 years old.
I threw my first business
when I was in the 8th grade.
I get it.
You're a hustler, right?
I get it.
The projections
is what's bothering you?
Let me just tell you,
this is ??
We've created
something people want.
You know what projections
are worth?
Bupkes, right?
They're worth nothing.
Nothing.
Bunim.
Focus on the only Shark
that's left.
Who's left.
Bunim, I ??
Look, when you came in here,
I thought
it was really crazy.
Mark, I think that you
can help a lot in this.
Hello?!
You got to work a deal, guys.
[ Laughter ]
Hey, Bunim, I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
Hey.
Hope you don't freeze
getting out of there.
[ Laughs ]
I don't regret
bringing up our projections.
They are ambitious.
That is what I'm trying to do.
That is the vision
that I'm executing on.
And if that vision
did scare them
or that wasn't something
they'd be on board for,
maybe it wasn't
a good match to begin with.
