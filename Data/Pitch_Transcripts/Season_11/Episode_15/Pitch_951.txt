Hey, Sharks.
My name is Bunim Laskin.
I am from Lakewood, New Jersey,
Bunim, I'm worried you're going
to spontaneously combust.
Slow down.
No, I want to see
how much faster you can talk.
You said 900 hours?
Laskin: 900 hours were booked.
So, we get our first 100 pools,
then the website.
I didn't really have the funds
to keep the operation going.
Laskin: Sure.
How much do you make,
what does the pool owner
charge?
Walk us through that.
Sure.
So, at the moment,
we let our host
charge whatever they'd like,
But, Bunim, what's the second
option for bathrooms?
The second option
is not offering one.
But if you don't offer one,
aren't people gonna pee
in the pool?
I think Jesse's peeing
in the pool right now.
But they are. But ??
[ Laughter ]
I don't think
you've given a sense
of what someone's willing
to pay to use that pool.
Right.
[ Laughs ]
Look, Bunim,
it's great to be excited,
right?
Mm?hmm.
It's great to be committed.
Every great entrepreneur
has to be.
But self?awareness has to be
a great trait, as well,
not lying to yourself.
Okay.
What we're talking about here
is that we took a product
this year,
we had three months to build.
As mentioned, there were
$675,000 worth of business
that went through the platform.
Only $150,000,
a little less than 20%,
actually was able to proceed,
Bunim, he's out.
He's out.
I'm 22 years old.
I threw my first business
when I was in the 8th grade.
I get it.
You're a hustler, right?
I get it.
The projections
is what's bothering you?
Let me just tell you,
this is ??
We've created
something people want.
You know what projections
are worth?
Bupkes, right?
They're worth nothing.
Nothing.
Bunim.
Focus on the only Shark
that's left.
Who's left.
Bunim, I ??
Look, when you came in here,
I thought
it was really crazy.
Mark, I think that you
can help a lot in this.
Hello?!
You got to work a deal, guys.
[ Laughter ]
Hey, Bunim, I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
Hey.
Hope you don't freeze
getting out of there.
[ Laughs ]
I don't regret
bringing up our projections.
They are ambitious.
That is what I'm trying to do.
That is the vision
that I'm executing on.
