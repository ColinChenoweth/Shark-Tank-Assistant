Hello.
My name is Ashi Jelinek,
Jelinek:
I have samples for you to try.
Good job, Phoenix!
?Bye, Phoenix!
?Bye, Phoenix!
Corcoran: Thank you so much.
Cuban: Thanks, Ashi.
Here you go.
O'Leary: Ashi, tell us
what we have here.
Jelinek: So, we have
our two flavors as of now.
Ashi, where are you
selling it at?
So, I'm selling right now
in independent grocery stores
in California.
It is shelf?stable, but ??
For how long?
A year.
A year?
Yeah.
Greiner: I'd love to hear
your background.
Yeah. So...
Tell us about you.
I, um, was actually ??
This was not my background,
doing beverage.
I worked in the hotel business
before.
So, how did you know
to create a formula?
Where did you go to do that?
So, at first, I started trying
to do it in my kitchen,
which was very not successful.

How do you find vitamins?
Some of these vitamins
are not soluble vitamins.
Jelinek: So, I was calling up ??
Right, so I found a formulator
that helped me work
on this product.
It took me a year
to create the product,
it took me a lot of time
to develop the flavors.
These are the first two flavors.
We have another two flavors
that are ready to go.
Do you have any sales?
So, since February 2018,
I've only sold $55,000.
Packaging is ready to go ??
How much money
did you have to put in
just for those two flavors?
Give or take,
like $150,000, $200,000.
Whoa!
Wow.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's no such thing
as "give or take,
$150,000 or $200,000."
Yes.
'Cause that's a big delta.
Jelinek: Capped post money.
Corcoran: You must
have rich friends.
How much did you raise?
$1 million.
Ohh!
$1 million?
Yes.
Wow!
I know that sounds
like a lot ??
Yes, it's a lot!
O'Leary: Wow!
but they are shocked
by how much Ashi has raised
bringing her healthier
juice alternative for kids,
KidsLuv, to market.
How much did you raise?
$1 million.
Ohh!
$1 million?
Yes.
Wow!
I know that sounds
like a lot ??
Yes, it's a lot!
O'Leary: Wow!
Yes, it is,
but it's taken a lot
for me to come up with
the vegan vitamins to source it.
I am in talks right now
with one big?box
national retailer to do a test.
Okay, so, how much cash do you
have left in the bank?
What ?? What did he ??
I have $50,000
left in the bank.
$50,000?!
?Yes.
?Out of the million?
?Whoa.
Ohh, Ashi!
You burned through $950,000?
So I want to explain that.
How did you burn $950,000?
Yikes!
Jelinek:
So, it's been 3 1/2 years
that I have been working
on this.
Okay.
Where did the bulk
of the $950,000 go?
So, regulatory.
What is that? Lawyers?
Okay, so ?? so ?? Yes.
What did you spend
the money on?
So I did international, um,
licensing,
Ashi, just listening
to this is so painful.
Then I paid for my ??
But I paid for my
manufacturing run, as well.
It's just ??
There was one thing ??
How much did you pay for
a manufacturing run?
It <i>is</i> painful.
Jelinek: ...that I just did.
So, I just finished a run,
Ashi,
listen to me a minute.
Cuban:
Yeah, Ashi, I mean,
the one thing that you
haven't owned up to
is saying that you're
going door to door.
For those reasons,
I'm out, Ashi.
Okay.
I wish you all the best.
Okay, thank you.
O'Leary: This idea has merit,
but we need sell?through data,
because I don't know
if the kids are gonna love it.
I don't know because
I don't see re?orders
through the distribution
you have yet.
So, we are online.
Thrive Market,
in the last six months,
has reordered every month.
We have sold out so many times
that I actually have
out?of?stock problems
in the flavors ??
Well, look,
that's encouraging,
but I don't want to take
this journey with you.
I just can't do it.
I'm out. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Herjavec:
Ashi, I have to tell you,
Ashi, I'm sorry, I ??
It makes me nervous
about giving you more money.
I'm out.
Listen, you went through
the process
of trying to over?protect,
patent everywhere.
It cost you a fortune,
