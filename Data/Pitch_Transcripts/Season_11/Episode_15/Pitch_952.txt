Hello.
My name is Ashi Jelinek,
and I am seeking $200,000
for 8% equity
in my company, KidsLuv.
This is my son, Phoenix.
My kids are my world,
and keeping Phoenix
and his siblings healthy
is a top priority of mine.
And as a parent, we all know
how difficult it can be
to make sure your kids
are eating well.
There is sugar in everything!
And sugar is sneaky.
It hides in the most
innocent?looking places,
like juice.
Most juices on the market have
upwards of 25 grams of sugar.
Wow.
If you were to give
your kid
an 8?ounce glass of juice
every day for a year,
you would be giving them
20 pounds of sugar!
No!
No!              No!
[ Laughs ]
Oh!
Corcoran: Don't do it!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, no! Oh!
Oh, Phoenix, you are
sugar?coated, my friend.
I knew I had to give him
something better,
and that's why
I created KidsLuv.
Okay, Phoenix,
get into position.
KidsLuv has this much sugar.
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary: Yeah!
Gotcha!
KidsLuv has no sugar!
But you know what it <i>does</i> have?
Vitamins and minerals ??
all 12 essential ones.
I've created the first
zero?sugar functional drink
for kids
that has certified
vegan vitamins and hydration.
Kids love it,
and parents do, too.
So, who wants to help me
spread the love?
?[ Chuckles ]
?Let's try it.
Jelinek:
I have samples for you to try.
Good job, Phoenix!
?Bye, Phoenix!
?Bye, Phoenix!
?Outstanding performance.
?Whoo!
[ Laughter ]
"See ya, guys!"
Here you go.
Both flavors.
Both flavors.
Here you go, Lori.
So, mango.
Corcoran: Thank you so much.
Cuban: Thanks, Ashi.
Here you go.
O'Leary: Ashi, tell us
what we have here.
Jelinek: So, we have
our two flavors as of now.
It's Flying Fla?mango
and Starstruck Coconut.
Cute name.
Alright.
And what is
the sweetening ingredient
that is replacing the sugar?
So, that's my secret recipe.
Wow.
It's my trade secret.
Herjavec: Oh.
That's really good.
But it is a combination...
This one's really good.
...of coconut water, juice,
a little bit of regular water,
and then I sweeten it
to cover the vitamins
with less than .1 grams
of stevia.
Not bad. Hmm.
What's really amazing
is that it is
only 10 calories.
I know. [ Chuckles ]
I can really taste
the stevia, though.
Is that real coconut water?
I can really taste it.
That's the aftertaste, right?
Yeah.
?It's really delicious.
?And so...
This, like,
dries your tongue.
...you can taste the stevia,
but basically,
I tried to formulate
without the stevia,
and then you get the back taste
of vitamins,
and so ??
O'Leary: And are
the kids pushing back
on the stevia aftertaste
or not?
No. Most kids
don't notice that.
Your messaging around cane sugar
is definitely on trend
because even adults ??
Yes.
How do I keep
this Adonis body?
[ Laughter ]
I just don't drink
any sugar.
Ashi, where are you
selling it at?
So, I'm selling right now
in independent grocery stores
in California.
It is shelf?stable, but ??
For how long?
A year.
A year?
Yeah.
Greiner: I'd love to hear
your background.
Yeah. So...
Tell us about you.
I, um, was actually ??
This was not my background,
doing beverage.
I worked in the hotel business
before.
So, how did you know
to create a formula?
Where did you go to do that?
So, at first, I started trying
to do it in my kitchen,
which was very not successful.
[ Laughs ]
How do you find vitamins?
Some of these vitamins
are not soluble vitamins.
Jelinek: So, I was calling up ??
Right, so I found a formulator
that helped me work
on this product.
It took me a year
to create the product,
it took me a lot of time
to develop the flavors.
These are the first two flavors.
We have another two flavors
that are ready to go.
Do you have any sales?
So, since February 2018,
I've only sold $55,000.
Packaging is ready to go ??
How much money
did you have to put in
just for those two flavors?
Give or take,
like $150,000, $200,000.
Whoa!
Wow.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's no such thing
as "give or take,
$150,000 or $200,000."
Yes.
'Cause that's a big delta.
I'm just questioning your
understanding of the numbers
and how important
you make money,
considering you're asking
for <i>our</i> money.
Yes, I understand that.
Right, so how m??
So, he's just saying, which one
was it, $150,000 or $200,000?
So, it was probably
close to $200,000.
And where did you get
the $200,000,
and how much all?in
have you invested so far?
So, so far, I have done
a family?and?friends round
of financing
on a $3.5 million
convertible note.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Wow.
Jelinek: Capped post money.
Corcoran: You must
have rich friends.
How much did you raise?
$1 million.
Ohh!
$1 million?
Yes.
Wow!
I know that sounds
like a lot ??
Yes, it's a lot!
O'Leary: Wow!
but they are shocked
by how much Ashi has raised
bringing her healthier
juice alternative for kids,
KidsLuv, to market.
How much did you raise?
$1 million.
Ohh!
$1 million?
Yes.
Wow!
I know that sounds
like a lot ??
Yes, it's a lot!
O'Leary: Wow!
Yes, it is,
but it's taken a lot
for me to come up with
the vegan vitamins to source it.
I am in talks right now
with one big?box
national retailer to do a test.
Okay, so, how much cash do you
have left in the bank?
What ?? What did he ??
I have $50,000
left in the bank.
$50,000?!
?Yes.
?Out of the million?
?Whoa.
Ohh, Ashi!
You burned through $950,000?
So I want to explain that.
How did you burn $950,000?
Yikes!
Jelinek:
So, it's been 3 1/2 years
that I have been working
on this.
Okay.
Where did the bulk
of the $950,000 go?
So, regulatory.
What is that? Lawyers?
Okay, so ?? so ?? Yes.
What did you spend
the money on?
So I did international, um,
licensing,
and international I. P.
[ Groans ]
Corcoran: Oh, my God.
Herjavec: And what did
that cost you?
And national I. P.
What did you spend
on that?
A lot.
So, on that, I spent
around...$150,000.
Ohh! Oh!
$150,000.
So I have all that done,
though.
I've trademarked
the name KidsLuv,
as well as
the parent?company name,
which is
The Luving Company.
Ashi, just listening
to this is so painful.
Then I paid for my ??
But I paid for my
manufacturing run, as well.
It's just ??
There was one thing ??
How much did you pay for
a manufacturing run?
It <i>is</i> painful.
Jelinek: ...that I just did.
So, I just finished a run,
and I spent, um, $57,000
on the run,
because it's Tetra Pak.
My plan and why I'm here
is to really focus
on West Coast right now
and then duplicate that plan
to other coasts
in a very strategic pattern
following where
my demographics are.
No, I got it.
That sounds very fancy,
but where are you gonna get
the money to do any of that?
Well, so, right now,
I'm also in the process
of talking
to my current investors
about putting money into
basically track me,
where we are ??
And what do your
original investors say
going back to them
for more money?
Are they eager
to lend it?
You know, now that I'm ??
finally have gotten
distribution in order,
and I'm ready to be in stores ??
[ Chuckles ]
Ashi,
listen to me a minute.
You did all of that
and spent all of that money
before you found out
the most important component,
which is, can it sell?
How fast can it sell?
How much of it can I sell?
Okay, so, I am
at that point now
that I have my distribution
in lock.
I understand that I spent money.
I am totally willing
to own my mistakes
and ways
that I could've saved ??
No, but here's the rub.
You're not owning
your own mistakes, really.
The investors
that gave you their money
are really owning
your mistakes.
And then you come here,
and you're asking us
to follow your other investors
down that little yellow path.
Well ??
It makes absolutely no sense.
So ??
It's amazing to me
that you don't see
what's wrong with that picture.
For all of those reasons,
I'm out.
Cuban:
Yeah, Ashi, I mean,
the one thing that you
haven't owned up to
is saying that you're
going door to door.
And I understand
it's tough for the family.
But I am.
I'm doing grassroots
marketing efforts ??
Marketing is not sales.
Marketing is trying
to create demand
so that there's sell?through
at some point.
But I <i>am</i> selling the product.
What I had to do in order
to get it to the market
is to come up with a strategy,
and, unfortunately,
I did not plan
on that the distribution
was going to take
this long to lock down.
Again, you say
the word "distribution."
Yeah.
I didn't say
"distribution."
You're just talking
about me doing it.
Yes!
Whose company is it?
Mine.
Who's responsible for it?
Me.
Who should be doing
all the selling?
Me.
That's what I'm doing now.
No.
Going out and getting
a distributor
is not doing
all the selling.
For those reasons,
I'm out, Ashi.
Okay.
I wish you all the best.
Okay, thank you.
O'Leary: This idea has merit,
but we need sell?through data,
because I don't know
if the kids are gonna love it.
I don't know because
I don't see re?orders
through the distribution
you have yet.
So, we are online.
Thrive Market,
in the last six months,
has reordered every month.
We have sold out so many times
that I actually have
out?of?stock problems
in the flavors ??
Well, look,
that's encouraging,
but I don't want to take
this journey with you.
I just can't do it.
I'm out. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Herjavec:
Ashi, I have to tell you,
I admire how much
you're standing your ground.
You've made mistakes.
Everybody here makes mistakes.
The problem is, cash is
the lifeblood of the business.
Agreed.
Once you run out of cash,
you're dead.
You've learned the theory
of great business plans.
With all due respect,
honestly ??
But you're not ??
But Thrive Market, I am getting
the reorders, and I am there.
But you're not fighting
in the trenches.
You're not out there
selling it, hand by ??
I am.
That's all I'm doing.
I have three little kids
at home,
and I'm the person hopping on
the plane to sell the product.
But you've also burnt through
$950,000...
I do not
sound the brokers there.
...in order to get here.
That's against
$55,000 coming in.
Ashi, I'm sorry, I ??
It makes me nervous
about giving you more money.
I'm out.
Listen, you went through
the process
of trying to over?protect,
patent everywhere.
It cost you a fortune,
and that was
a big hole for you,
because the bottom line is,
you didn't even know
if your product
would sell well.
I feel that,
while I liked the product,
you got into that trap.
But unfortunately,
as an investor,
I wouldn't want
to be involved with it.
And I'm sorry.
I hope you do well.
Thank you.
But I'm out.
Thank you.
O'Leary:
I blame you for it.
You made a huge mistake.
I'm sorry. It's just,
the numbers don't lie.
Good luck.
Thank you.
We wish all our entrepreneurs
good luck...
Thank you.
...but you've got
a wall to climb.
Cuban: Good luck.
Thank you so much.
I feel like I did
get a little beat up.
I think that, you know, because
the Sharks got so hung up
on the money that I've raised,
they didn't see the true value
of KidsLuv,
and unfortunately,
because of that,
they're obviously
not the right investors.
That was a huge mistake
on the patent side.
I got to tell you,
when it's my money
and I lose it, I feel bad.
Oh!
But when I take
a dollar from you...
Somebody else.
...that is ??
I wake up every day
to give you your money back.
Yes.
And she didn't even
feel bad about it.
