Robert, Robert,
lift that off the counter!
Watch out! You're
burning the counter!
Herjavec: [ Shrieks ]
[ Laughter ]
And coconut.
Thank you, Robert.
For you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Mr. Wonderful.
O'Leary:
Thank you, thank you.
and now we're transforming
healthcare in America.
When I pitched on "Shark Tank,"
I had done $2.5 million
in sales.
In just two years
since "Shark Tank,"
EverlyWell has done
$65 million in sales.
EverlyWell kits are now
available in over 2,000 stores,
at major brands,
like Target and CVS.
With all this growth,
we've decided to invest
in a major re?brand,
and Lori's coming by to weigh in
on some
of the potential changes.
I like this one because
there's a heart,
which, to me,
symbolizes health.
Greiner:
I love health and wellness,
so when Julia came into the
Shark Tank with in?home testing
and she was so credible
and so smart, I said, "I'm in."
We're excited to get this
out into the world.
Well, the world's loving it
so far.
Yes, yes! [ Laughs ]
I think EverlyWell is on track
to become
one of my top success stories
in "Shark Tank" history.
When Julia hit
$65 million in sales,
it took my "Shark Tank" family
past a huge milestone
that we are super excited about.
I have a big surprise
for you!
Really?
I do.
[ Cheering ]
My "Shark Tank" investments
have collectively done
$1 billion in retail sales.
Let's party!
[ Cheering ]
MacKugler:
Lori is a rock star!
She's helped us
absolutely explode.
Hopper: I was Lori's
very first deal on "Shark Tank,"
and I'm so stoked to be part
of the billion?dollar family.
We've done $18 million
in sales.
$30 million!
$40 million!       $40 million!
$50 million!
$52 million!
$175 million!      $175 million!
$233 million!
$1 billion in retail sales!
This is everything that I,
as a Shark, live for.
I am so proud of all of them,
and, hey,
my hard work has paid off, too.
Together: $1 billion!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Jesse's like most Americans
and can't afford
his own private pool.
All he has to do is visit
our website or app,
find a pool, lock it in,
and just like that,
Jesse's booked himself
the perfect poolside day,
and pool owners can now monetize
their pool's downtime,
even make a profit.
Swimply is quite literally
throwing the biggest pool party
the world has ever known,
and you're all invited.
[ Laughs ]
Which one of you will be
the first to jump in?
I'm not getting in
with that guy.
Wait, is this
really for real?
It's for real.
He's happy!
Basically, you're like
Airbnb for pools.
Exactly.
So, is the app alive
on the App Store?
The app's alive.
So, how many downloads
do you have,
how many users,
how much revenue?
Okay.
And how many pools
do you have?
And who in the world thought
this was a good idea?
I'm ?? Me. So ??
[ Laughter ]
The story behind Swimply
is actually a personal solution
for me.
My next?door neighbor built
a pool for her grandkids,
and they didn't show up as much
as maybe
the grandmother supposed,
and the pool was always empty.
I sort of asked her
if it would be okay
if my family used their pool.
Very consciously aware
of the amount of money
she recently put into it,
she asked me if it would be okay
if my family helped her out.
?Oh.
?We worked out a deal.
We helped her pay
25% of her expenses,
and in exchange,
my family used her pool.
Before long, our entire block
was using the pool,
and I wanted to bring this
to as many people as possible.
I thought it was crazy when
you walked in here with this,
but now that I listen to
the story of how it occurred...
It's crazy.
What's happened?
So, tell us.
So, I put together
my bar mitzvah money,
and I launched a small website.
I went on Google Earth.
I found 80 people that had pools
and knocked on 80 of them.
Good for you
for doing that.
76 said "no,"
but we got our first "yeah."
[ Laughs ]
?Yeah.
?So, we got our first
four yeses,
and our four pools
quickly escalated to 32.
I raised 30 grand
to launch an MVP.
I spent the whole 30 grand
on the website,
just hiring a developer
and a designer.
So, wait. How much bar mitzvah
money did you burn initially?
10 grand.
Okay.
But initially, I raised 30 grand
to make the site not crash.
So, I launched with Swimply,
and immediately,
we did around 900 hours' worth
of reservations.
Hey, Robert.
$289 million in two years?
In three years.
But growth is never ??
Three years.
It's not linear.
It's just crazy.
It's almost ??
These are how
start?ups grow.
It is all about scale.
It is all about growth.
How many companies
go from zero to $289 million
in three years?
Zero.
None.
It's not zero, and we have
$675,000 of proof of concept
on 80% of our pools.
The 20% of our pools
that are optimized and managed
attract $675,000.
I can't take it anymore.
I love that ??
I love your ??
And that's before scale,
before insurance,
and I'm the only person
doing this right now.
I love your passion.
We have two customer service
representatives.
I love your ??
This is something that we
can really blow up, guys.
O'Leary: [ Laughs ]
That's where you lost ??
Okay, and if I do need help,
I am 22.
That's not an excuse.
To figure this out
and operate this business ??
That's not an excuse.
Robert.
I'm not ??
Not an excuse at all.
All I'm saying is I am learning
every single day.
Oh, my God.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Andy Bert.
This is my brother Eric.
We're seeking $120,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company, Bertello.
[ Italian accent ]
Sharks, do you like a?pizza?
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, you know
what's even worse
than what my grandfather Vinny
would think
about my fake
Italian accent?a?
[ Normal voice ] It's the
quality of home?baked pizza
in a conventional oven!
I mean, let's be honest ??
it's complete garbage!
Now, imagine baking
authentic, Neapolitan?style,
wood?fired pizza
at over 900 degrees
in your own backyard.
Introducing Bertello Wood Fire
&amp; Gas Outdoor Pizza Oven.
Our oven has
multiple fuel options.
You can use
the propane burner attachment
or you can use
wood kindling.
What?!
[ Laughter ]
That's not all, Sharks.
You can also use
lump charcoal.
What?!
But wait!
There's more!
You can use wood pellets.
Herjavec: Ah.
Corcoran: Wow.
What?!
And with our
patent?pending design,
you can use wood with gas
at the same time.
What?!
What?!
So, Sharks, next time
someone asks you
to take a bite
out of a frozen pizza
or a take?and?bake pizza
cooked in a home
conventional oven,
forget about it!
?Ohh!
?Ohh!
?[ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]
So, Sharks,
let's do a deal.
Capisce?
?Oh, my God.
?What?!
What?!
Are you gonna do the pitch
like that?
Very good, very good.
Great bad theater.
Very good bad theater.
Cuban: Can we eat?
?Wow.
?Can we?
?Wow.
Oh, yes, please,
help yourself, and ??
Yeah. You guys, eat.
What am I, chopped liver?
Where's my pie?
We would like to
invite you up, Kevin...
Oh, thank you.
...Mr. Wonderful,
to cook a pizza with us.
Are you gonna
clean up a bit?
?Oh, my gosh.
?Yeah, are you cleaning up?
Alright.
Am I gonna make a pie?
Is that the idea?
?Yes. Yes.
Wow, that's really good.
Corcoran: Oh, my gosh.
Really good.
It is good.
See how I'm doing this?
Out of the skill ??
Spread it out on the back.
A little bit more.
Now, I want to put
a little cheese on it.
Pepperoni's great.
Andy:
Thank you very much.
Parmesan.
Gonna put some pepperoni
down on here.
Alright. Oops.
So you're gonna want
to shake it back and
forth to get it moving.
Don't worry.
I'm skilled at this.
Alright.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Oh, beautiful.
So, how long am I waiting
to take my pie out?
You want to rotate it
every 20 to 30 seconds.
I already know that.
Alright.
How many minutes per pizza?
Up to 2, max.
Yeah.
2 max?
2 minutes?
What?!
Corcoran: Great for a party.
O'Leary: I think
I'm almost done, right?
Yeah, you can rotate it.
Thank you.
You're burning it!
Greiner:
He should've rotated it.
I like a little carbon
with my pizza.
[ Laughter ]
Nothing wrong
with that.
Yeah.
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.
Beautiful.
Is that done?
A matter
of preference.
Good job, Kevin.
O'Leary: Thank you.
I'm taking this with me.
Robert's eaten his entire one.
?Nice.
?It was so good.
?This is really good.
?Yeah.
?Thank you very much.
?Really, really, really good.
Eric:
Awesome. Thank you.
Is there anything on the market
like this now?
We do have
one competitor,
but they do not have
the ability
to use wood with gas
at the same time,
and they don't have
as many fuel options as us.
What's the advantage of using
wood and propane,
as opposed to just wood
or just propane?
Eric: So, with the propane,
you can preheat the oven.
So you just heat the oven up
five minutes
before you're gonna cook...
Mm.
Got it.
....throw some wood in,
...get the flame rolling.
It's just faster.
Yeah, faster and easy.
Greiner: Is this allowed
to be used indoor?
I would not generally
recommend using it indoor.
It would be similar
to using a gas grill inside.
Herjavec:
How much does it cost?
It's $250.
That's it?
What does it cost you to make?
$84 landed.
?Wow.
?Oh.
Cuban:
What's your net margin?
Our net is $33.
So, guys, where are you selling
it, how much have you sold?
We're selling on Amazon.
Okay.
This year,
we've done $640,000.
Wow.
We've done $400,000
in the last three months.
Cuban: Good for you.
So, how much money
have you guys invested?
Have you taken any
outside investors, any debt?
We have probably
$90,000 into it.
We borrowed $70,000 at
the beginning of the year
and just paid
all of that back.
That's the inventory
you funded?
Wow. Good for you.
Yeah, for inventory.
Is it just the two of you
alone in the business?
Yes.
Yes.
So 50/50 partners?
80/20.
What's the story?
You guys chefs?
Yeah, so, I'm actually
a licensed structural engineer.
Ah, that makes sense.
I've been working
in Manhattan for 10 years
doing bridge design
and bridge inspections.
So, I'd climb to the top
of all the biggest bridges
around Manhattan.
You'd climb
to the top of them?
Wow.
Climb to the top.
Verrazzano, Queensboro Bridge,
Williamsburg,
Manhattan Bridge.
Dang.
Andy: I'm in finance.
Right out of college,
I went down,
I worked in the biggest
open outcry trading pits.
Since then,
moved back to Minnesota.
Wife, kids, and work in
financial services.
So, did you
actually design this,
or did you have someone else
do it with you?
I designed it.
I did everything.
What's been the largest obstacle
you've had to overcome?
Really, it's just keeping up
with the demand.
That's a good problem
to have.
A nice problem.
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
So, we would have to wait to get
money from our current order
to put money down
for the next order.
Why would you want to build
your own pizza oven
when there's at least five
that I know exist?
What is the personal motivation
to say,
"Forget the five that are
already in the market,
I'm going to go and try
and get share with a new one"?
Yeah, no, I go for it.
I think big.
When I was 10 years old, I
started building a tree house,
and I made probably
the biggest tree house
in the entire
United States.
You're an engineer.
Did you really?
Greiner: By yourself?
It's like an Ewok village.
Andy: It was awesome.
It's massive.
I worked on it from age 10
until I was like
23 years old.
Oh, wow.
[ Laughs ]
Which discipline ??
That's dedication.
That's being all?in.
Eric: Yeah.
?No, I mean, I go overboard.
?There's a 13?year tree house.
And I look back at it now,
and I realize
I have a certain quality.
I just get super passionate
about whatever I do,
and I'm ??
I'm obsessed with this.
Guys, look, what you've
accomplished is great.
Your margins are good,
you're selling through.
The challenge is, you're still
just a consumer product.
It's just not a business I just
want to get attached to.
I'm not that guy who, like,
"Let's heat up the grill,"
you know, "and let's go make
some pizza in the backyard."
So, it's just not a fit for me,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
No problem.
Thank you, Mark.
Congrats, guys.
When you came out,
I was really excited.
Obviously, I love the pizza.
[ Laughs ]
But I don't know ??
I'm sitting here,
I'm not excited about it,
for some reason.
I don't know whether it's
there's so much competition.
I'm not seeing the connection
between the Andy and Eric
pizza show,
the oven, and how you're going
to go to mass market.
And for that reason, I'm out.
Corcoran: I think it's
a beautifully designed oven,
but I'll tell you what
I can't get here.
When you did
your dog?and?pony show,
I mean, we were, like,
jumping in our seat,
and then you got hit
with a pizza,
and then everything changed.
Yeah.
Are you still recovering
from that?
[ Chuckles ]
Maybe a little bit.
What's happened?
?Your energy really went...
?Yeah.
No, really,
what's happened?
I'd love you to address that,
because that's
my main point of concern.
in Eric and Andy's
wood?fired pizza oven, Bertello,
but she is concerned
about their lack of energy.
No, really, what's happened?
I'd love you to address that,
because that's
my main point of concern.
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm super energetic, but ??
Really?
Um ?? Yeah, absolutely.
Even the way you said that
wasn't energetic.
[ Laughter ]
I'm super energetic!
Do you want me
to talk like this?
Yeah, that's it!
That's a boy.
I'll talk like this.
I can talk like this.
Yeah.
No, but now it feels
like an act.
I know.
Before, it felt like you.
Now it feels like an act.
?It's bad theater.
?Aw.
?But what about that?
I mean, I'm matching the tone
and energy of the room.
Barbara, what he's saying is,
you're putting him to sleep.
[ Laughter ]
No, I mean, I love ??
It's an odd thing
because usually
I'll buy into products
that I'm not that crazy
about the product...
Yep.
...and I love
the entrepreneur...
Yeah.
...and I do very well
with it.
I've never been mistaken
when I follow my heart
on the entrepreneurs.
But I really ?? I don't think
I've ever been
in a position
where I love the product ??
I live, eat, sleep, and breathe
this ?? this pizza oven.
?I bet.
?Yeah.
I, uh, work on this
seven days a week, 24/7.
I happen to think it would do
very well in retail.
It doesn't take up
a lot of space...
Yeah.
...the price point is good,
it looks luxurious.
I'm absolutely open
to that option.
Okay, I'll give you
an offer.
We've been to bes??
I'll give you the $120,000,
but I need 25%.
Um, really, it's you, Eric,
and a bunch of money
required for inventory,
and probably more optimization
on digital
that you've never done.
Okay.
But I want 30%.
If I get behind this,
the numbers will be up tenfold.
Would you do it for 25%?
Yes.
Whoa ??
We would love to take
your deal.
?What?!
?Let's do it.
?Whoo!
?I don't believe it!
Thanks, guys.
I won't step in that.
I got to be careful.
Herjavec: Wow.
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you very much.
Let's do it.
Wha??
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
You like that?!
Whoo!
We got the same offer
from Barbara and Kevin,
but we went with Kevin
because he believed in us
from the start,
and he made an offer
right away.
Barbara wasn't sure.
Barbara, you said to him
he had no energy.
Hard to get a deal
when you call somebody boring.
Well,
you're right about that,
but that proves that they
didn't recover from that.
I like engineers.
I hope you lose
all your money.
I hope you lose
your money.
Why are you being
so mean, Barbara?
I'm being mean 'cause
I'm annoyed. That's why.
Watch your hand, buddy.
It's really hot now.
You didn't see this
in the ??
Greiner: Oh, whoa!
Corcoran: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Robert, be careful.
?It's really, really cool.
?Oh!
Robert, Robert, lift that
off the counter!
Watch out! You're
burning the counter!
Take it off the counter!
Lift it up!
Pee on it, Robert!
Pee on it!
Corcoran: Really.
Oh, my God.
[ Shrieks ]
[ Laughs ]
Is there a nice,
big, black stain?
