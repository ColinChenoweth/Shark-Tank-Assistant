My name's Rachel Lincoln.
And my name
is Kristine Pruske,
but you can call me
Krissy.
?Stop.
?Stop.
?I just got it. No.
?No. No.
[ Children arguing
indistinctly ]
We hail
from San Antonio, Texas.
And we are seeking $100,000
in exchange
for 33 1/3% equity
in our product,
The Space Traveler.
[ Arguing continues ]
Can you quiet down,
please?
Child: No, stop!
Don't make me
come back there!
No!
Oh, gosh.
Shark Tank,
we have a problem.
[ Sighs ]
[ Static crackles ]
Be advised ?? we've encountered
disruptive life?forms.
Over.
Downloading visuals now,
over.
Child: Give it.
Give it.
?It's my turn.
?Give it.
?Give it.
?Give me it.
?Give me it.
?Give it.
Give me my toy.
Aah!
Give it.
Give it.
Greiner:
"Disruptive life?forms."
[ Arguing continues ]
Shark Tank,
we have the solution.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my Lord.
The device
has been installed.
Ah, the sweet sound
of space.
Mission accomplished!
Mission accomplished!
[ Laughter ]
We're all guilty
of distracted driving,
especially
with kids in the car.
It can feel like you're
getting sucked into a black hole
of fighting
and distractions,
making you want
to scrub the mission.
[ Laughter ]
What kids need
is their own space.
The Space Traveler
separates your kids
while giving them
their own atmosphere.
The forecast is clear.
The Space Traveler
is on the launch pad,
ready to fuel up
and blast off!
Together: Who's ready to suit up
and take this journey with us?
[ Chuckles ]
My little carbon copies
will now disembark.
Okay.
Nice job, guys.
Cuban: Good job, guys.
Way to fight.
Greiner: Good job.
Boy: Goodbye.
O'Leary: Okay, so, does this in
any way impede the seat belt?
Can you still use the unit?
Yes.
Yes.
We have seatbelt?access
slots here,
sized to fit the seat belt.
So, a child can use it
without a booster,
just by itself,
like Margaret was doing.
You could use
the car seat, also,
and it has
latch?access spaces,
so you could slide the latch
in there, as well.
You can use the seat belt
or the latch system.
I have a question.
How did you come up with this?
So, last summer,
we were about to take a trip,
and the kids were going to be
on the bench seat,
and I thought, "Well,
how am I going to
keep them separated?
There is just no way
that I'm going to take this,
you know, journey
with these kids fighting."
So, I thought,
"Let's start
with a collapsible
laundry hamper."
We have a photo.
We have a photo,
a collapsible laundry hamper.
Oh, my ??
[ Laughter ]
That's pretty good.
So, the kids loved it,
and I thought,
"Okay, the laundry hampers
worked okay.
But let's try
a collapsible dog kennel."
[ Laughter ]
So, after that trip,
I called Rachel,
I was like,
"We have the best idea."
You're onto something.
And that's how
The Space Traveler was born.
Yes.
My daughter, Alyssa,
and my son, Jake,
they just go at it
like cats and dogs, right?
But I can see them
weaponizing it, you know...
Yes.
...where, hitting through it,
like they think
they have protection.
Right.
I mean ??
We believe if you
separate them visually,
it does a lot for also
separating them physically.
And you don't have to put it
for all three kids.
You just have to separate
the middle one?
Unfortunately, they
actually will start fighting
about who gets to ride
in The Space Traveler.
Ah, that's a good sign.
And then it does fold down,
like all the others do?
?It collapses, yes.
?Yeah, it's collapsible.
?It just twists down flat.
Yes. Yes.
Let's show you.
Cuban: Oh, there you go.
So, that twists around.
Herjavec: That's clever.
Right here.
That's great.
Krissy, what do you charge
for it?
So, right now,
we have two prototypes.
Uh?oh!
O'Leary: That's it?
Ohhhh!
We're pre?revenue?
Yes.                   Yes.
Tell us what you think you'll
charge for this one for car use.
We were thinking
about $29.99.
Yes.
And what do you think
it'll cost you to make?
About $17 to $18.
$17 to $18.
Cuban:
Oh, that's expensive.
Wow.
$17?
Yes.                        Yes.
So, guys,
what's your background?
We are both mothers,
first and foremost.
Yes.
Krissy started coming up with
the ideas about 10 years ago.
Yes. So ??
Krissy, you had this
10 years ago?
No.
So, about 10 years ago,
when I became a mother,
I would find a need
for a product.
So, I started to design...
Her own products.
...my own products,
and Rachel would kind of
help me tweak it a little bit.
Oh.
And you've sold some?
So, we've had
some amazing designs,
and we've pitched them
to a couple companies
up in New York.
You know, they said
they loved the product,
but, you know,
didn't want to ??
They wanted you
to pay how much?
They wanted you to put up,
like, $25,000 for it?
No. So ??
Well, actually, they said
they weren't interested
in the product.
They weren't interested.
So, about a year later,
I went into
a major box store,
and I saw my product.
No!
Yes.
Did you litigate?
But the best part of the story
is, we did it again!
Yes.
We sent them a sample!
It was like a toxic
relationship.
Greiner: No.
We didn't know.
Yes!
?No way.
?Yes.
?Yes.
What did you send them?
We sent our next idea.
Which was a nap mat.
It's a nap mat
that rolls into a pillow.
Yes.
And it looks
like a stuffed animal.
And it looked like
a stuffed animal.
And we actually sent them
the sample.
Why?
And what happened?
I think you need to
stop sending things.
Well, we learned
our lesson.
So, Krissy, Rachel, I want to
thank you for coming today.
You can leave.
We'll knock it off.
[ Laughter ]
Perfect!
But why would you, after they
allegedly stole your idea ??
why would you send them
another one?
That's a really good
question.
[ Laughter ]
It is.
It's a really good question.
We gave them the benefit
of the doubt.
Yes.
You know, people
have great ideas ??
Well, that's more
than a benefit.
Alright,
I have to tell you, I ??
I love your guys' story.
I thought it was
a very good presentation.
[ Smacks lips ]
I don't like this product.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I think my kids would drive each
other nuts hitting each other.
I'm out.
Okay, we appreciate that.
Yes, thank you.
So, we see the future
of The Space Traveler
for licensing ??
character licensing.
Character licensing.
Possibly making it
look like a police car
or a fire truck.
Or a fire truck.
You know,
that's a cute idea.
I mean, you guys
obviously are creative.
Your presentation was adorable.
The problem for me
as an investor,
you're so new, it's a prototype.
Mm?hmm.
You've not had any sales
or any response at all
from the public.
So, for those reasons,
I'm sorry, I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
We appreciate that.
Thank you.
Guys, I did a deal
with a company called
Under the Weather.
Yes.
Yes.
And it looks just like
their product.
The challenge is,
there's patents on
a lot of pieces there.
Yes.
Have you done
patent searches
to make sure you don't conflict
with any existing patents?
Not yet.
No.
We have a provisional patent
on it in place.
In place.
I think it'd be a conflict.
So, for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Congrats, though.
Thank you.
Krissy, Rachel,
you have a great idea.
I almost want to say to you
send it to the guys
that ripped you off.
At least you'll see it
in the market.
[ Laughter ]
Look, it's not a journey
I want to take with you guys.
You're very nice.
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'll tell you what
you're reminding me of so much,
is we had two crazy guys,
brothers, last year...
Mm?hmm.
...and they pitched
a stupid product
that I didn't even get.
It was a Comfy ??
Yes.
It's a sweatshirt/blanket
with a hoodie.
Yes.
And I didn't get the product,
but I liked the guys...
Uh?huh.
...and nobody wanted to invest,
there was no proven sales.
So for all the reasons Lori
didn't like it, I love it.
And The Comfy today,
with my help,
are doing $150 million
in sales.
Yes.
I happen to think you're
gonna sell a ton of these,
but I have to make money
right away.
Understood.
So, I'll give you exactly
what you asked ??
$100,000 for 33 1/3%,
but I want a royalty of $2
for every sale,
but the royalty goes away
the minute I recoup
my investment.
Okay.
But I'll take you
from where you are now
to production.
Okay.
You'll have the right website,
the right name...
Yes.
...and you'll have
a non?naive partner,
which you just really need.
Yes.
Yeah.
Because I've been used, abused,
and I got over it
by the time I was 30.
So nobody will use
or abuse you anymore.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes.
You should say yes
right now.
Yes.
[ Cheers and laughter ]
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Nice to have you.
Yeah. We'll make a lot of money
right on "Shark Tank."
Okay. Yes. Awesome.
We did it!
Pruske: Going into the Tank
with just a prototype,
we knew it was risky,
and it was amazing to see
that Barbara
also believed in us
just as much as we've
always believed in each other.
