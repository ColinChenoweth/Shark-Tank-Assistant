Hi.
My name is Nadine Habayeb.
I live in Boston, Massachusetts,
Habayeb:
So, on my right, your left,
you have
our Himalayan pink salt.
I like starting with this one
because it's a great way
to taste the intrinsic flavor
of the seed itself.
The middle one
is our white cheddar.
This is
our most popular flavor,
Habayeb: It's more expensive
than popcorn.
By how much?
So, it's...
Twice the price.
...almost twice as much.
It's $3.99
for a bag of ??
Whoa!
$3.99 this bag?
Nadine, that's
a lot of money.
But this is
actually the same price
as all the other snacks
on the shelf that it lives with.
So, you will not actually
find this on a shelf
where you see popcorn
or potato chips.
You're gonna see this where you
find your better?for?you,
alternative?ingredient snacks,
not processed, not extruded.
What does "extrude" mean?
Extruded is when you

into the shape of a ??
O'Leary:
What I like about you ??
She's got the answers.
You know your stuff,
Nadine.
I'm the person who buys
all of the snack things
Habayeb: Sure.
Can you add fiber to it?
Have you been thinking
of adding fiber to it?
Totally.
So, one of the really
interesting things
about the seed itself ?? when
you grind that down to a flour,
it does extrude, so we <i>can</i> play
with the nutrient density,
we can combine higher protein,
higher fiber.
Nadine, tell us a little
bit more about yourself.
Sure, sure.
Nadine, it's
a lot more expensive,
Barbara has made an offer
of $200,000 for 30% of Nadine's
popped water lily seed snack
company, Bohana,
but Kevin is also interested.
30% is sheer greed.
I hate greed.
Are you ready
for something wonderful?
Here's an offer.
Oh, wow!
I'll...
I'll give you the $200,000
as a loan.
Okay?
Okay, Nadine,
you got to decide.
Right. Um ??
Um...
[ Exhales sharply ]
That's so hard.
Obviously, I would love
to work with you.
Don't you love
the dilemma?
Of course. It's an amazing
dilemma to have, but ??
You're a smart lady.
What does your gut tell you?
What are you feeling?
[ Exhales sharply ]
Barbara, this is an opportunity
to really value our equity,
