My name is Brett Ellenson,
and I'm from Tempe, Arizona.
And my name is David Sodemann,
and I'm from Phoenix, Arizona.
Our company
is Boho Camper Vans.
We are seeking
a $300,000 investment
in exchange for 10%.
Boho Camper Vans
is changing the way
that people travel and live
through one simple,
yet powerful word ??
"freedom."
We hear the word
"freedom" all the time,
but most of us never get
to truly experience it.
The average American
is swimming in debt,
tied to an inflexible
work schedule,
and is just trying to keep up
with the cost of living.
Most of us feel as though
we'll never catch up,
and there must be a better way
to experience life.
Boho Camper Vans is giving
people back that freedom.
We rent
and we sell them.
So, whether you're looking
for the tiny home on wheels
for your
short?term adventure
or the ability to live
on the road full time,
Boho Camper Vans has
everything you need ??
comfortable beds,
kitchenettes with running water,
solar?powered electricity,
pull?out countertops, and more.
The best part ?? you
can take them anywhere.
Mobile living
is not a new concept,
but Boho Vans
is different
because we cater
to a broader demographic.
Our vans are affordable,
easy to drive,
and ?? let's be honest ??
extremely photogenic.
"Shark Tank."    "Shark Tank."
[ Laughter ]
Let's help people
live more with less.
Who wants to join
this movement?
But first...
Oza: Let's try it.
...who wants to check out
this van?
?I do.
?Yeah!
?Yeah!
Lock us all in there.
[ Both laugh ]
Greiner: This looks, like,
totally fun.
Yeah.
Sodemann: We try to make it
look like a tiny home.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
I kind of love it,
right?
If it had a shower...
Yeah.
Greiner: If it had a shower.
Running water?
?Yes.
?Yes.
?Yeah?
You could actually
hit the switch
right under the countertop
right there.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There you go.
Oh, okay.
Sink works.
Yep.
And what's it take
to do a shower?
They're out the back.
We can show it to you.
O'Leary:
There's a shower back there.
Greiner: I got to look.
Don't see that too often.
Yep.
We got the shower here.
Sodemann:
But here's something that you're
actually really gonna love.
Oh, you're kidding!
So, we actually do
butcher?block countertops.
This comes out about
another 3 feet,
and you can do all
your cooking under here.
Oh, my God.
How fun is this?
Extra storage.
It's really cool.
Thank you.
What's your background?
How'd you get into this?
Sodemann:
The idea came from a trip.
So, I went with my girlfriend
to Maui,
and we explored the island
in a camper van.
So, we came back and realized no
one was doing this in Phoenix,
and it's such
a hot tourism town,
and everybody rents
their cars
and they go
to the Grand Canyon,
and lodging up there
is suspect.
So I called Brett,
'cause I know he's
a really great builder.
He's a master
at his craft.
So, we discussed it
over one night,
and the next couple days,
we bought a van and got to work.
My background is machining
and fabrication.
I've been doing
tool and die work
since I've been
14 years old.
What's <i>your</i> background?
My background ??
I went to school for
design and marketing.
We started this
as a passion.
We wanted to just use it,
you know,
and maybe make a little money
on the side
if we weren't using it,
and then we
couldn't even use it
because it was booked up
so much.
Wow.
So we built another one ??
and another one.
So you have
a whole bunch of them?
We have five vans
in our rental fleet.
Greiner: Five vans.
And we've sold 12.
And you've sold 12?
How much would you
rent this out for?
It comes out to be
just under $200 a night,
and we have
a three?night minimum.
Ellenson: Yeah.
Oh!
And once you buy it
and trick it out,
how much are you
into the van for?
For our rental vans,
we're into them
right at about $20,000.
That's it, huh? All?in?
That's not bad.
Sodemann: Yeah.
Wow.
Because we're buying the vans,
we're sourcing them used.
On a $20,000 van,
how much revenue
can you generate in a year?
So, we're doing about
$2,000 a month per van.
Would you say you pay back
a van within a year?
Eight months.
Eight months.
How many have you guys sold
for people to live in?
Literally, to live in?
So, out of the 12 vans
that we've sold,
it's basically
half of them.
Really?
We see this as
mobile real estate.
We see this as kind of
the next level of living.
Oza: What gives you guys
an edge and a difference,
and how do you scale this model
beyond a master craftsman?
So, first off, they're
very affordable in this space.
We have lots and lots
and lots of people
that have reached out
to us,
just wanting to get
on our list to build a van.
Tell me what fitting it out
like that costs.
This van was $15,000 used.
Mm?hmm.
And we charge $29,000
for this build?out.
And I'm curious.
How long does it take you
to actually do that van?
So, right now,
we have our process
just under three weeks.
And do you have any debt?
Nope.
Zero.
No debt?
Good for you.
So, how much did you make
in the last year?
So, in the last eight months,
in 2019,
we're at $195,500 net.
Wow! Good for you.
Net or sales?
Our sales total, this year,
calendar year ?? $493,000.
Greiner: Wow.
And $195,000 net?
?Wow!
?Really?
That's really impressive.
Good for you guys.
That's impressive.
So, you're looking
for money from us.
Ellenson: Yes.
What are you gonna do
with that money?
So, I'm gonna take the money,
and I'm gonna put it
into manufacturing and get it
so we can actually have
finished pieces ready
to go in the van,
and we can hire on
just installers,
'cause everything's
pre?cut, pre?fab.
So, it's like pre?fab?
Exactly.
Gotcha.
Let's go to the numbers,
'cause I'm a numbers guy.
So, if I'm an investor,
what am I going to make
next year?
So, this year,
we're gonna project
to be at $800,000
in sales...
Okay.
...by the end
of the year.
So, next year,
we're projecting 1.9.
1.9?
Cuban: Oh, so, you guys
will kill it.
That's what we project
next year.
What am I gonna make on that,
pre?tax?
I think we're gonna be
close to a million.
A million?
Ellenson: Yeah.
Cuban: [ Clapping ]
Out of 1.9?
You're gonna net a million?
Sodemann: Just based
on our margins now.
Yep.
Why don't you have
a lot of competitors?
I don't get that.
We talk about it a lot.
It's time, it's space,
it's know?how.
Alright, so, I'm in.
For how much?
Hold your horses,
Barbara.
[ Chuckles ]
This is "Shark Tank."
I love your numbers,
but you're only doing 495.
Let's round it up ??
500 or 1,000.
And you are basically asking
for a valuation of $3 million.
That's a sporty valuation.
Yes.
Cuban:
Not if they're making a million
in profit next year.
Well, wait a second. That
assumes everything goes right.
Guys,
I'll make it simpler.
Look, I think it's
a great business for y'all,
but it's just not a fit
for me right now.
Congratulations, man,
but I'm out.
The way I see it ??
The way I look at it and say ??
Oza: I haven't finished,
Kevin.
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead.
Yeah, really.
Give me a moment,
because, you know ??
You don't get a moment.
My juices are flowing.
I look at it
and say to myself,
"I should be the third partner
at 33 1/3%."
I'll give you the $300,000.
I want 1/3 of the business,
because I'm Mr. Wonderful.
They don't look happy,
Kevin.
They look <i>very</i> happy.
[ Laughter ]
You should always be happy
when you get an offer
from Mr. Wonderful.
Oza:
So, look, he's trying to gouge
you. Can you come back to me?
'Cause I was putting
some real numbers on there.
O'Leary: No gouging.
It's a reasonable offer.
Thank you for the offer.
Yeah, we appreciate it.
[ Laughter ]
Oza: "Thank you for the offer,
but piss off."
Greiner:
"Thank you for the offer."
O'Leary:
Well, let's see ???
So, what are you
gonna do, Rohan?
Oza: Look, you got to get
to a more reasonable
and fair valuation
on this.
1/3 is too much.
I would go
for the $300,000.
Happy to bring all of
the sort of marketing muscle
and awareness building
that this thing needs to have,
but I'd want 25%.
Whoa!
What's the difference?
You get Mr. Wonderful ??
I mean, I'm a quarter.
There are three quarters.
It's a big delta.
If you guys are interested,
let's talk about it.
If not,
I'm fine to move out.
You guys got to pick it
or leave it.
You haven't
heard from me yet.
And who was most excited?
You were very thrilled.
[ Laughter ]
David and Brett have
two offers on the table
for their designer van
business, Boho.
But Lori also seems interested.
Greiner:
I think it's super cool.
I could see people
loving this.
Um...I got to think
for a minute.
I'm going to think for a minute
about my offer.
Well, while she thinks,
return to me for a minute.
Oza: If you guys
want feedback, great.
If not,
I'm happy to be out.
No, they want more offers,
and here comes an offer.
I don't think you need
a partner at all.
I think you need cash.
That's it.
You've got a plan.
You're working the plan.
It's going exactly as you had
wished it would ??
probably better ?? and I
do believe your projections,
that you're gonna make
$1 million next year, okay?
So, I'll give you
exactly what you want ??
$300,000 for 10% ??
but I'll give it to you
in the form
of $150,000 in cash up front
and $150,000 in credit line,
and then
if the business expands
and continues to grow
at the same rate ??
and I see no reason
why not ??
I'll continue
to fund the growth.
Simple.
Interesting.
Oza:
How is that a Sharky offer?
You're giving them
exactly what they wanted.
No, it's not exactly
what they offered.
It's half
what they offered.
If you're considering
debt,
I'm far more creative
than Barbara is,
and I can make you
an offer
you might find
extremely attractive.
And you still get the Sharks
that way.
How about I loan you
the $300,000
at 9% for two years,
venture debt,
and I get 7% equity?
You could walk into a bank
and get it for less.
It's a terrible offer.
Yeah.
Respectfully, we really pride
ourself on being debt?free.
So you don't want
to do that.
Good for you.
You were listening to Barbara
with her debt deal.
Well, let me make you
an offer.
What?!
I'll do the $300,000
at 20%,
but mine has a caveat.
I want a charitable component
in this.
To a van?
For what?
Hear me out.
Hear me out.
To a homeless cause.
Yeah, I hear you.
O'Leary:
Give it to a charity.
There's a lot of homeless people
in America.
Absolutely.
I see it constantly
because I'm always
in just major cities.
We absolutely love
that idea.
It's something we've
been wanting to align
with ?? a social cause.
We love it.
Respectfully, would you
be able to go down
to 15%
with that same offer?
You know, that 15%
is really low.
Does that mean you're not
considering my offer?
Nor my offer?
I would stick it
at the 20%.
You know, guys, my offer
is really the best offer here
'cause it gives you
exactly what you need.
And in addition to that,
there's nobody here
that can market better than me.
Oh, that's ??
[ Laughs ]
There is no one here
that ??
You can laugh
all you want.
I'm laughing.
There's no one here ??
[ Laughter ]
I'm totally laughing.
You shouldn't be
overly concerned with debt.
You're a profitable company.
Take the debt issue
off the table.
I respect
your whole debt?free strategy,
but I wouldn't be concerned
with these guys.
They're not gouging you
at 20% interest rate.
Thank you for
the business advice.
So, I'm the lowest?cost deal,
if you actually think about it,
by miles.
$300,000 debt at 9%
for two years, 24 months,
and I only want 7% equity.
What was the interest on
the loan that you're offering?
Whatever interest I get
on the loan, I pass on to you.
It's not to make money.
It's so that you take off the
table the least amount of stock,
because I've been
in the position
of almost selling
a lot of stock
and a few years later
realizing ??
Mine's the least stock,
Barbara.
...realizing that I'd made
a terrible mistake
if I had done the deal.
Why give up 10
when you can give up 7?
Hold on.
And I'm a sweetheart.
Just give up 7.
We can give up...
Oza: Can I do
a drumroll, please?
...then we're only having to
pay back the other 150.
[ Both talking indistinctly ]
[ Whispering ]
Barbara?
[ Whispering ] Yeah.
Yeah, let's do it.
Barbara?
You got a deal.
You got it, baby.
Cuban: Nice!
[ Laughs ]
Kevin got smoked
by Barbara!
Yay, Barb!
Smoked!
Nice one, Barbara.
?Nice!
?Thank you.
Sodemann:
Thank you so much.
We're so excited.
Thank you very much.
Good luck, guys.
Good luck, guys.
Congratulations.
Good luck.
Sodemann: Thank you.
Oh, man!
Ellenson: So, Barbara was
a perfect fit for us
'cause she knew we
didn't want any debt,
and she gave us a way
to pay it off quickly.
And Barbara, she knows
real estate, so...
Totally.
...we keep touting we're
mobile real estate,
Yeah.
we're the future of it,
so we're glad
to have her on board 'cause
she's gonna take us places.
Yep.
Narrator: In Season 6,
David Heath and Randy Goldberg
struck a deal
with Daymond John for Bombas,
their sock company
with a social mission.
You have a deal.
We'll take the deal.
Mazel!
Narrator:
Let's see how they're doing now.
Heath: Six years ago,
we quit our jobs
to start a sock company.
We wanted to have
an impact in the community
by donating a pair of socks
for every pair sold,
but we had no idea
that it would turn into
the movement
that it is today.
We've done over $225 million
in revenue
and donated over
30 million pairs of socks
to those in need.
For years, our customers
have been asking for more,
so a few months ago,
Bombas launched
the most comfortable
T?shirt ever.
Just like our socks,
for every T?shirt we sell,
we're gonna donate one
to the homeless community.
We have been giving socks
to the Bowery Mission
since we started this company,
and we couldn't be more excited
to have our T?shirt
donation event with them.
What size would you like?
Medium.
Medium?
Goldberg: The Bombas
donation T?shirt is built
to meet the needs of people who
are experiencing homelessness.
It's extra durable,
it has reinforced seams
and an anti?microbial treatment
so it stays fresh longer
between washes.
John: Man, you don't need
an extra large.
You need a large
like me, man.
You're the same size
as me, brother.
John: It's absolutely amazing
to be here in the community
and seeing the people
one?on?one
and pressing the palms to them
and talking to them.
John: How you doing, man?
Man: Hey!
What's happening?
How you doing?
This is not about
checkbook philanthropy.
This is rolling up your sleeves
and being able to meet the ones
that you are serving.
Nice to meet you.
Heath:
It's always so inspiring
to keep doing events like this,
giving back
to the community,
as it reminds us
why we do what we do.
You always make it good
when you come.
You always make it good.
John: This has been such
a unique investment for me.
I've learned so much
about a social cause.
I've learned about giving
to a community
and making sure
that it's infectious
for other people
who want to give, as well.
It is absolutely amazing,
and I'm proud to be part of it.
