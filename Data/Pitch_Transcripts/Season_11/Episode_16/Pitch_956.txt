Hi.
My name is Nadine Habayeb.
I live in Boston, Massachusetts,
and I'm here seeking $200,000
for 10% of our company, Bohana.
Sharks, like many Americans,
popcorn was one
of my favorite snacks ??
until I discovered
something better.
I'd like to introduce you
to Bohana,
a delicious and nutritious snack
made out of
popped water lily seeds.
You heard me right ??
seeds of a water lily plant.
Not those small lily pads
that you see floating on ponds
here in the U. S.,
but a giant variety that are
native to the north of India.
These plants produce seeds,
and when roasted over high heat,
they pop
right out of their shell ??
just like popcorn, but better,
because popped water lily seeds
contain 50% more protein,
fewer calories and fat,
and my favorite part ??
no kernel,
so nothing to get stuck
in your teeth.
Damn.
Wow.
When my co?founder, Priyal,
introduced me
to these beautiful seeds,
I quickly said goodbye
to popcorn
and hello
to my new favorite snack.
Now, Priyal
can't be with us today
because she, too,
is about to pop.
[ Laughter ]
Priyal grew up in India,
where they've been eating
water lily seeds for centuries,
and today,
they're one of the world's
fastest?growing ingredients.
And I can't wait
for you to try some.
So, who wants to get in on this
wildly fast?moving food trend
and help bring Bohana
to snackers all across America?
Me.
Dying to try.
Let's try some.
Yes. Please do.
Tell us what we're trying here.
Tell us what we're trying.
Habayeb:
So, on my right, your left,
you have
our Himalayan pink salt.
I like starting with this one
because it's a great way
to taste the intrinsic flavor
of the seed itself.
The middle one
is our white cheddar.
This is
our most popular flavor,
and it's
our only non?vegan flavor.
Wow. That's pretty good.
And our Soulful Spice
is the bright?red one,
which has a little bit
of a kick to it.
It's very similar
to puffed rice.
Yes. Yes.
To me.
I mean, in taste.
It's lighter than popcorn,
tastier than popcorn...
It's very good.
...and airy as could be.
It's delicious.
The question is,
is the taste profile there?
Would you trade this
for popcorn?
I would.
So, there is a bit
of an intrinsic taste.
You know,
it's a water seed.
It has a smokiness that's quite
natural to the seed itself.
They have all nine
essential amino acids,
and that's very rare to find
in a plant?based food,
is really what
makes this very special.
Do I have to worry about
a huge educational process
with the snacking public?
Yes. We know this is something
that we are pioneering.
We are the first people
to be bringing water lily seeds
to the U. S.
The "Aha" moment
is when people try this product.
Every single demo
that we've done
in stores that we sell in,
we've completely sold out
of every single bag
that we sell in?store.
Really?
But they don't even know
what this is, right?
But when they taste it, they're
willing to make that change.
So, the familiarity
and similarity to popcorn
is what's really helpful
for someone.
So, what do you
sell these for?
Is this the same price
as a popcorn bag?
Habayeb: It's more expensive
than popcorn.
By how much?
So, it's...
Twice the price.
...almost twice as much.
It's $3.99
for a bag of ??
Whoa!
$3.99 this bag?
Nadine, that's
a lot of money.
But this is
actually the same price
as all the other snacks
on the shelf that it lives with.
So, you will not actually
find this on a shelf
where you see popcorn
or potato chips.
You're gonna see this where you
find your better?for?you,
alternative?ingredient snacks,
not processed, not extruded.
What does "extrude" mean?
Extruded is when you
reconstitute a flour
into the shape of a ??
O'Leary:
What I like about you ??
we're hitting you hard,
and you keep coming back.
She's got the answers.
You know your stuff,
Nadine.
I'm the person who buys
all of the snack things
that are, like, high protein
and low fat and low sodium.
So, when I look at this,
the only thing that's missing
for me here is fiber.
Habayeb: Sure.
Can you add fiber to it?
Have you been thinking
of adding fiber to it?
Totally.
So, one of the really
interesting things
about the seed itself ?? when
you grind that down to a flour,
it does extrude, so we <i>can</i> play
with the nutrient density,
we can combine higher protein,
higher fiber.
Nadine, tell us a little
bit more about yourself.
Sure, sure.
You're pretty impressive,
standing in your space there.
I have a background
in marketing.
I used to work
in the fashion industry.
I worked for
a French fashion house.
Which one?
Yves Saint Laurent.
Ooh?la?la!
I love that.
I was actually living
in the Middle East.
Which city?
I lived in Dubai. I was
actually born and raised there.
So, I'm originally Lebanese.
My father
was based in the U.A.E.
and in some Gulf countries
for his work,
and so I was born there,
and that's where I grew up,
kind of moving in and out,
and I lived in the U. S.
only when I went to school,
actually, for my undergrad,
and then later, my master's.
So, you're at the fashion house,
and you were...
Yeah, so, then I went back
to do my MBA,
and so ??
Where?
I ended up finishing
at Babson College.
We launched
in April in 2019 ??
'18. Excuse me.
This is
your first full year?
Yes.
So, what have you done
in your first full year?
'Cause you're
asking for ??
Yeah.
...before Kevin gets to it,
might as well beat him to it ??
a $2 million valuation.
Yes.
We've done a revenue
of $123,000.
Over what period of time?
Over the past 16 months.
Okay.
We've been in retail
for only about nine months,
since the beginning
of this year.
We spent the first phase really
testing out our market online,
on Amazon and our website,
some specialty ??
Nadine, it's
a lot more expensive,
and it has kind of a unique
taste that you have to adapt to,
but it's a slog, right?
It's not a straight path,
and it's very difficult.
While the product
was good,
it's gonna take
some getting used to.
I just don't get excited
enough about it,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
I'll make you an offer.
Just like that, Barbara?
Yeah.
I've been listening hard.
This girl's hot.
She's very good,
but there's only one
Lebanese?Irish guy here.
This is what I like
about the product ??
I love the fact that
it's more digestible.
No choking aspect,
I like.
It's more filling
than popcorn.
I've been sitting here
eating it,
and I feel like
every kernel I eat
is probably three times
more filling than popcorn,
so I think I'd eat less of it
for a healthy snack.
I had such good luck with
a brother and sister here
on their business
named Pipcorn,
and they have $12 million
in sales, 3,500 stores.
They would help you
with whatever you need
'cause they are about three,
four years ahead of you, okay?
But all that being said,
it's a young business.
It's not a proven model.
So, I'll make you
the $200,000 offer for 30%.
Greedy.
It's not greedy at all. I think
that's a fair?priced offer.
That's very fair.
Savage. Savage.
Rohan, could you please
beat her up with valuation?
So, here's
the scenario.
It's a tough one because
you got the Indian side
and you got
the snacking side,
which is guiding me into
doing this deal with you.
But given the stage you're at
at the moment
and given that I don't see
the clear leap,
at least from
the American palate to this,
much as I love
the Indian side
and I love
the snacking side,
unfortunately, I am out.
Aah! Okay.
So, who's in?
Anybody here other than me?
Well, listen, I love it.
I will buy it.
But to give an offer
at this moment,
because it's lacking fiber,
I'm gonna be out.
Thank you for
your consideration.
O'Leary: I'm really
struggling with it
because I think
you're spectacular
and I got the whole
Lebanese heritage thing.
I'm Lebanese, too ??
or Lebanese?Irish.
That's close, right?
[ Chuckles ]
The trouble with this is,
your sales are tiny.
You are definitely not worth
$2 million.
I mean, normally, I would
squeeze Barbara's head
'cause she's greedy
and just do damage to her deal.
Not at all.
My gosh.
I'd love to do that
to you, Barbara.
[ Laughs ]
Find somebody else.
No, I just ??
I think she's
a good partner for you.
I don't need you
as my salesman.
I'm fine on my own.
Don't mess with me,
Barbara.
I'm gonna squeeze
your head right now.
I'm fine on my own.
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
So, maybe ??
You know ??
Don't mess with him.
You're gonna get an offer.
Because she's
pissed me off ??
You shouldn't
have said that, Barbara.
I don't care.
I'm not afraid of you.
Ooh, Barbara.
Put it in, Kevin.
Put it in.
Cuban: What are you
gonna do, Kevin?
Retribution.
Are you ready
for something wonderful?
Oh, wow!
Barbara has made an offer
of $200,000 for 30% of Nadine's
popped water lily seed snack
company, Bohana,
but Kevin is also interested.
30% is sheer greed.
I hate greed.
Are you ready
for something wonderful?
Here's an offer.
Oh, wow!
I'll...
I'll give you the $200,000
as a loan.
Okay?
And I'll only take
8% equity.
Much less.
Ooh!
Just to mess with Barbara
because she said
bad things to me.
Oh, my God.
What a baby.
I would take Kevin's
in a heartbeat.
Now you have
a really tough decision
because you don't have
to give up so much equity.
Take it!
Don't even wait!
I will loan it to you. I'll give
it to you for three years.
I'll charge you 9% on it.
I'll take 8% equity,
go on the ride with you,
give you all my team
to push.
It's actually
a better deal.
30% is sheer greed.
I hate greed.
I can't stand that.
Thank you.
That's a very generous offer.
It is. Because nobody
would loan you money
except Mr. Wonderful.
Is that true?
No one will loan you money?
No.
Not at your stage.
Not at your stage.
Not at my stage.
Unfortunately.
Tough call for you.
Who are you
gonna go with?
I mean ??
[ Exhales sharply ]
Thank you both very much
for your offers. Um ??
It never sounds good when
an entrepreneur says
"Thank you very much
for your offer."
Well ?? [ Laughs ]
Barbara, you should have been
much nicer to me.
You wouldn't have
this dilemma.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, Kev.
Let her go.
Um...
So, obviously, you know,
we value our equity.
We value our equity a lot.
We think that there's
a lot of value here,
and it's gonna be huge.
Um...so...
8%, you know,
is obviously very attractive.
You're allowed
to counter.
Yeah.
There's a vast difference
between a loan and a partner.
No, I'm a partner.
A loan shark and a partner.
I help all my businesses.
That 8%'s gonna be worth a lot.
Is there any opportunity of
you two doing a deal together?
Never.
I don't even like him.
He hates that.
O'Leary:
I don't need Barbara.
I don't need anything she's got.
I'm way better than she is.
I like to like
my partners,
and then they grow
to a love affair.
That's what I accomplish
with every one.
Talk to my CEOs.
You'd be great.
Not this guy.
Okay, Nadine,
you got to decide.
Right. Um ??
Um...
[ Exhales sharply ]
That's so hard.
Obviously, I would love
to work with you.
Don't you love
the dilemma?
Of course. It's an amazing
dilemma to have, but ??
You're a smart lady.
What does your gut tell you?
What are you feeling?
[ Exhales sharply ]
Barbara, this is an opportunity
to really value our equity,
and, um...
so I think
I'll take Kevin's offer.
Oh!
Yes!
Looking forward
to working with you.
Thank you.
Greiner: That's what happens
in "Shark Tank."
Congrats.
Bye.
[ Squeals ]
We're so excited
to start working with Kevin.
He is a super?smart Shark,
and he realized that, you know,
what our company needs is money,
and he also valued our equity,
and so I think that
was the right decision.
Barbara, you pissed me off,
and it cost you big.
Just because he's a baby.
He's a baby.
Don't piss off
Mr. Wonderful.
Oh, my God.
I'm so afraid of you. My gosh.
