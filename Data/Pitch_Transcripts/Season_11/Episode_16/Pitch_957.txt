My name is Krystal Persaud,
and I'm from New York City.
I'm here seeking $150,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company called Grouphug.
So, Sharks, guess what.
I'm 31 years old,
which technically makes me
a Millennial.
But before you all judge me,
I know that Millennials can get
a bad rap these days,
but one thing this generation
really cares about
is taking care of the planet,
So, Krystal, it's that moment
in "Shark Tank."
There's one Shark left.
I know!
One great idea
can change your life.
Now, it depends
what Mr. Cuban wants to do.
Mark, I know that I can make
more Solar Cats.
I <i>have</i> actually talked
to some businesses in New York
about getting them
in their windows.
What do they cost to build
something like that?
All?in was maybe $1,000
because it was ??
That's it? Okay.
Yeah, because it ??
'Cause to me, there's
some corporate business there,
Good luck.
Persaud: Thank you so much!
Bye!
What a sweetheart.
Yeah, she's gonna be
really good.
Oh, my God!
I think I am living proof
of the American Dream.

with $100 in their pocket
