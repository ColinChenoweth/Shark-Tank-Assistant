Zirkle: Hello, Sharks.
My name is Drew Zirkle,
and I'm from
Virginia Beach, Virginia.
I'm seeking $100,000 in exchange
for 14% equity in Safety Nailer.
Sharks, whether you're
picking up a hammer
or you're building a deck,
there's nothing more rewarding
than doing it yourself.
Except sometimes, starting
a nail can be challenging.
Ow!
[ Sharks groan ]
But that's why
we invented Safety Nailer.
Our patented tool
protects your fingers
while making hand?nailing
and starting screws
easier and safer.
It straps to your fingers,
allowing for hands?free work,
and there are strong
neodymium magnets
that hold the nail
or the screw in place,
with multiple grooves
for multiple size fasteners.
Check it out.
"I'll go in business
with you, Drew.
I believe in the product."
We find
an injection molding machine.
Your own?
Yeah.
Yeah, we bought one for $3,000,
and then we bought a mold,
and we made the first 2,000
by hand,
and we learned really quickly
that was challenging.
Wow.
So, where'd you go
from there?
So, what happened was,
around that time,
a third?party company
reached out to us,
said, "Hey, let me help you."
I'm anticipating this story's
going south real fast.
You know where this
is gonna go.
No!
Long story short ??
It <i>is</i> a long story.
But it's not short.
Wait! Stop!
We felt like
we were losing control,
so we said, "You know what?
We're gonna go find
our own factory."
So that's what we did.
China?
In China. Correct.
What do they
charge you for one?
So, we were landing for,
like, $1.75.
We sell them ?? $9.99 on Amazon,
$9.99 on our website.
And what have sales
been last year,
and what will they be
this year?
$40,000 last year.
Sales to date right now
are $85,000.
I'm projecting
through the holiday,
we should hit over 100,000,
I hope.
You making any money
on that?
So, right now, we're showing
about $2,000 or $3,000 profit.
Okay. Is this
your full?time job?
This is not
my full?time job.
My full?time job
is a project manager
for a large consulting firm
designing
wastewater treatment plants.
O'Leary: So, you're not
full time on this deal?
It's not bad, but it also
leaves it listless, you know?
It's sort of ??
An investor like me
wants to put in $100,000
and have somebody to call
in the morning,
saying, "How's it going
with the Safety Nailer?"
I get it. I get it.
You're a great guy.
I love the story.
But I'm out.
Thank you.
You know, for me,
this lacks sex appeal.
Also, I don't think this deal
has room for <i>any</i> partner.
Not enough sales.
So I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Barbara, appreciate it.
The one thing
I want to bring out ??
we've actually filed a utility
patent on the second product.
Drew, look, it's not even
a question of the product.
The product's great.
The challenge is,
it's not a company yet.
Whether it's you or
somebody else, there's got to be
somebody who eats, sleeps,
and lives the business
24 by 7 by 365.
You're not quite there,
where I need it to be,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
But congratulations
'cause it's a great product.
Thank you.
Before we go any further,
can I at least show you
our other product
that's here?
Yeah, absolutely.
This is our toy product...
Cuban: Slingshots?
...that Dan invented,
okay?
[ Chuckles ]
What happened was, there was
a clacker on the floor,
and we were making
Safety Nailers,
and the magnets were in wrong,
so they flipped backwards.
Right away ?? what if you had
a clacker that didn't clack
because the magnets
were always repelling?
So ??
[ Laughing ] What?
What would that do?
You mean
it doesn't clack?
It doesn't clack.
And we knew.
You're probably gonna want it
to clack, I think.
Yeah, I think I do.
Well, then change everything.
I'm in.
The thing is,
kids love the magnets.
That's it?
Yeah, it's simple.
I want one.
Let me see. Let me see.
A clackless clacker?
Yeah.
What the heck does that have
to do with Safety Nailer?
I know.
Wait.
Why do you want this?
This is not just "Pitch
anything you feel like."
I wasn't trying to, sir.
This is actually
kind of cool.
What else do you got
in your bag of tricks?
There's two other products
that I can't show you guys.
No, don't show any more.
I was joking!
Okay. Sorry.
[ Laughter ]
I can't take it.
Cuban: These are
actually pretty cool.
It doesn't clack.
So, these are the only two
in the world?
Yeah.
As far as I'm aware.
Now you're down to one.
[ Laughs ]
Mark, that's gonna cost you
something, alright?
[ Laughs ]
Oza: So, Drew, look,
I love this product.
Like ?? surprisingly,
I <i>have</i> hammered nails,
and I have hit my hand,
and when I first did this,
it was fantastic.
So I love the product.
Thank you.
This could be
a licensing deal.
And I was very close
to turning to Lori
and saying,
"We'll do the licensing."
But now
I'm looking at Lori,
and she's got this
"I don't know" look on the face,
and I'm wondering
if the clacker coming out
done messed up
the whole ??
No, the clacker ??
No, look ??
If you guys go in,
I'll put in money just to get
rights to the clacker.
Well, to me, I feel like
this is a licensing play.
Right.
Now, Mark just said
that he'll jump in...
If I get the rights
to this.
Oza: If he gets the clacker.
...if he gets the clacker.
So, Mark,
if we give him $100,000,
you're willing to put up
1/3 of that?
Uh?huh.
What planet
are we on here?
50/50 partners,
contingent on a licensing deal.
We will do our best
to get you a licensing deal
with a big name,
put it out there everywhere.
We'll handle the legal,
we'll broker the deal.
I appreciate your offer.
Um...
So...
33% for that offer.
We earn 66%, and you guys
are gonna earn 33%.
So, wait.
Can I take this one home?
Can I take this home?
Mark, you can take that one home
if you really want to.
Done. Deal.
Done on the clacker.
Are we done?
Yes.
How you pulled that out,
buddy, is next?level.
[ Laughter ]
?God bless. Thank you.
?Thank you. Brilliant.
Cuban: Congrats, Drew.
Yes!
So, with three Sharks,
we're gonna take Safety Nailer
to the next level.
It's gonna be awesome.
You know what?
Okay, wait a second.
He is a really
good guy.
Wait a second, Lori. Lori.
The only reason that happened is
Cuban wanted to spend 100 grand
for a clacker
that doesn't clack.
Doesn't clack!
