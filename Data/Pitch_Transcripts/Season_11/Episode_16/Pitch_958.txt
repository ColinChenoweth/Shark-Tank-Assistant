My name is Krystal Persaud,
and I'm from New York City.
I'm here seeking $150,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company called Grouphug.
So, Sharks, guess what.
I'm 31 years old,
which technically makes me
a Millennial.
But before you all judge me,
I know that Millennials can get
a bad rap these days,
but one thing this generation
really cares about
is taking care of the planet,
and a huge part of that
is ditching fossil fuels
and switching
to renewable energy.
So I thought, "I'll go out
and buy a little solar panel.
How hard could it really be?"
But the only ones I could find
were for camping, fishing,
hiking.
And if you're renting
an apartment ??
like me, in New York City ??
installing solar is almost
impossible to figure out.
But what if I told you
that I invented a way
to harvest solar power
from any type of home,
no rooftop and no expensive
installation required?
Are you ready for it?
We sure are.
We're ready for it.
Introducing the Grouphug
window solar charger,
a beautifully crafted,
innovative solar charger
for any? and everyone.
Installation takes two seconds.
All you have to do
is hang it in your window.
So, I'm gonna demo that
for you right now.
I'm facing the solar cells
outside for the fake sun.
Even Kevin can do that.
[ Chuckles ]
And while the sun hits
your solar panel during the day,
all of that energy gets stored
in an internal battery,
meaning you can charge
your favorite devices
day or night.
And the beautiful bamboo frame
is designed to blend in
with any type of home decor
so that you look good
while you're doing
a little more good
for the environment.
And, Sharks, this product
is just the beginning
of what we can do at Grouphug.
With this same model, we can
create stunning solar panels
of any shape, size, or pattern
and take larger appliances
off the grid.
I truly believe
that the future of solar
is making it as beautiful
as it is efficient,
and that's the key to getting
more people to adopt it.
So, Sharks, who wants
to join this Grouphug
and change the way
that we get energized?
Each of you guys has a sample
right in front of you
with, hopefully,
your preferred charging cable
so you can test it out
and charge up right now.
How did you come up
with the name "Grouphug"?
With the name "Grouphug" ??
So, I actually have
seven years of experience
making consumer electronics.
I started off as an intern
at a tech company in New York
seven years ago.
Are you an engineer?
I'm not an engineer,
but I like to say
I'm a creative technologist.
So, I'm a little half science,
half art, is how I describe it.
Which company
did you work for?
The tech startup
was called littleBits.
Mr. Wonderful,
it's in the toy space.
Yes, I know it.
I was
an industrial design intern,
and by the time I left,
I was senior director
of product design.
I didn't want
to work for someone else.
I knew that I could come up with
something that was worth a lot.
What's your background?
So, I'm actually
a first?generation American.
My parents are from Guyana.
My three older sisters are all
in medicine and healthcare,
so I've always been kind of
the black sheep of the family,
and it's always been a struggle
for me, actually,
with my parents that I
can actually make money
and make a living as a designer
and as a creative person.
How much charge time
do you get,
and is the intention that
this would just charge devices?
To talk geeky,
it's a 10?watt panel.
There's a 2,200 milliamp?hour
battery built inside,
and then that battery
will charge your phones,
tablets, bike lights.
Anything small.
Anything small,
USB?related.
Do you have any idea
how you'll sell this?
Wait, here's
a better question.
No, that's
a very good question.
We don't need
a better question.
Wait. Have you even
sold it yet, though?
Yes. So, I officially launched
this in June, and I have ??
Of this year?
Of this year.
Is this a Kickstarter
or an Indiegogo?
Yeah, it started off
as a Kickstarter.
I have $80,000
in sales so far.
Wow!
What were you
aiming for?
My target on Kickstarter
was $10,000.
Have you shipped
the 80K yet?
Not yet.
Ooh.
What does it cost?
What do you sell it for?
The MSRP is $149.
Right now, it costs me
$42 to make.
That's at 1,000 units.
How low could you get it
in quantity?
If you made 10,000,
what would it cost?
If I made 10,000, the price
would drop closer to $35.
But are you doing all of these
by hand in your home?
[ Chuckling ] No.
No, so, because I worked
in consumer electronics,
I actually know a lot
of factories out in Shenzhen.
I spent weeks there before...
Okay.
...troubleshooting
on the factory floor.
Nice. Now they're making
it for you, basically?
Yeah.
So, right now, with the factory,
we're working with them
to, like, reduce the amount
of exposed hardware,
clean up a lot of the edges,
and take it to
a fully manufactured product.
And actually, to speak
to the bigger vision,
I have a couple photos
that I want to show you.
So, this was actually
a custom cat?shaped solar panel.
It's called Solar Cat, the
cutest solar panel ever made.
Is that <i>you</i> Solar Cat
or someone else Solar Cat?
Greiner: You created,
designed it, and put it ??
So, Grouphug
has a Solar Cat?
Yes.
A museum saw
what I was doing,
and they wanted to bring
something into their museum
that people could see up close
to educate them about ??
That's a museum?
Yeah.
It's the New York Hall of
Science in Queens, in New York.
That's cool.
O'Leary: I mean,
in a snapshot for me,
this is
a commodity business.
This thing is gonna be
very hard to make money with.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
I appreciate it, Kevin.
I think it's really great
what you're doing.
You're so early, though,
that I just don't have
any read or feedback
on how this is gonna work
in the home
and what's going to be
people's reviews and feeling.
For right now, I'm out.
First of all, you made me
fall in love with Guyana.
Oh!
I mean, if everybody
in Guyana's like you,
I'm headed out there
next weekend.
Thank you.
Okay.
What I love is
your presentation style.
What I don't like is,
I think the product
just plain?out
looks ugly.
And I think, most importantly,
you have a long way to go
to figure out
how you're gonna market.
I think it's gonna be
hard for you
to get
an investment on that.
Okay.
So, Krystal, it's that moment
in "Shark Tank."
There's one Shark left.
I know!
One great idea
can change your life.
Now, it depends
what Mr. Cuban wants to do.
Mark, I know that I can make
more Solar Cats.
I <i>have</i> actually talked
to some businesses in New York
about getting them
in their windows.
What do they cost to build
something like that?
All?in was maybe $1,000
because it was ??
That's it? Okay.
Yeah, because it ??
'Cause to me, there's
some corporate business there,
but out in parks
and getting a sponsor,
so if it only costs
$1,000 ??
I really wanted to get one
in New York, actually.
I've been really inspired.
Right, 'cause you
want to showcase where
someone can do it, right?
So, we find a place,
put in a front
where people can sit there,
charge their batteries,
and it's brought to you
by Morgan Stanley.
Yep.
Right. So, I can see
that happening.
Look,
you're impressive.
I think there's a lot
of upside to the concept.
Obviously, the execution
needs a lot of work...
Yes.
...but I'll make you
an offer.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll give you
the $150,000...
Okay.
...but I want 25%.
25%.
Um, would you be willing...
No.
...to go down to 20?
No. No.
Um, you got a deal, Mark.
[ Laughter ]
I would love
to work with you!
Greiner: Congrats.
Thank you so much!
Corcoran: That's great.
What a happy ending!
Good luck.
Persaud: Thank you so much!
Bye!
What a sweetheart.
Yeah, she's gonna be
really good.
Oh, my God!
I think I am living proof
of the American Dream.
My parents immigrated here
with $100 in their pocket
from Guyana,
and look at me now.
I just got a deal with
Mark Cuban on "Shark Tank."
