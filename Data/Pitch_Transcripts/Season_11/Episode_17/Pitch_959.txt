And I'm Linsey.
Both: And we're from Goumi.
We're seeking
$1 million....
Oh!
Whoo!
...for 8% equity
in our company.
Holy...
Sharks, we're obsessed
with the power of small.
Babies are amazing miracles,
but as newborns,
they tend to have limited
motor control in their hands,
and that's why many
scratch their faces.
Also, they tend to lose a lot
of heat in their extremities,
heat that they're gonna need
to thrive,
all while growing
at a rapid pace.
This is why mittens
and booties and pajamas
are on
every baby checklist.
But let's face it ?? the current
products on the market
just aren't well?designed.
I mean, how many parents have
dealt with the frustration
of losing that tiny mitten
or that tiny sock
because they
just don't stay on?
We have solved this problem one
tiny hand and foot at a time.

Goumi is a thoughtfully
designed line
of essential baby products
that are functional,
comfortable, breathable,
and sustainable,
as well as beautiful.
Our flagship product,
Goumi mitts, is unique
because they actually stay on
and protect the baby.
We do this with our
signature two?part closure.
Clever.
Our Goumi boots
feature the two?part
closure system, as well,
using elastic to tighten
and Velcro to secure.
So these boots
actually do stay on.
Our patented Goumi Jamms
go from gown to sleep sock
in one snap.
but Mark is critical
of how Lily and Linsey
are marketing their high?end
baby apparel company, Goumi.
That's why
we need the money.
That's fixable.
That's absolutely fixable.
But it's not. You're
asking us to give you
$1 million to fix that.
That's why we're here.
We need help in that department.
But at a $12.5 million
valuation,
we're paying you
to hire us.
Guys, that's not gonna work
for me.
For those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
So, I'm trying
to figure out,
how are you getting
to that valuation?
I'm choking
on the valuation.
Is it the need
for that amount of capital?
Is it you just think
you're gonna be that good?
'Cause usually,
a business figures itself out
in seven years.
The valuation largely came
from the fact
that we were able to raise
that valuation before.
The other thing is,
moving from a wholesale
to a direct business ??
huge for us.
We've gotten customer
acquisition numbers
now down to $16,
sometimes $8.
And we're moving ??
historically, it went
from mitts and boots business
to now much more of a gifting
and higher?priced
product business.
Those are the two
main reasons.
You've been in business
for eight years,
and you have $5.2 million?
I have another sock business ??
Grace &amp; Lace ??
and they were in business
for five years
and they have $15 million.
That's a sizable difference.
I believe that the problem
you have that <i>they</i> don't have
is they have
70% returning customers.
You're in
the new baby business,
so it's very, very expensive
for you
to constantly start
and find new customers,
and I believe that's why
you're only doing 15% online.
I think it's gonna be
very, very hard,
and I think
it's grossly overpriced.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Thanks.
I will say ?? I think that you
have a great?quality product.
It's really quite beautiful.
It's very premium and high?end.
There's a market for that.
I personally, though,
have spent my career
creating great?quality product
but trying hard to make it
at an affordable price
Yeo: Do not give up
on your dream.
Get it out there,
get it out.
Do not be afraid
because you're small.
I'm so proud of you.
