I'm Brandon Fay,
and I'm seeking $150,000,
10% equity of my company.
Sharks, when you want
to go eat Italian,
first thing
comes to your mind ??
"Oh, boy.
I gotta go to a restaurant.
Even with a reservation,
I'm gonna wait a while."
Then, the pasta's expensive,
Brandon...
Yes, sir?
...I think
it's a genius idea,
but I have
a personal issue
on why this may be
a challenge for me.
I have horrible acid reflux.
Horrible.
So, you know,
I can't have onions,
I can't have tomato base.
This is like kryptonite
to me,
even though
it was delicious.
So, unfortunately, I'm out.
Correct.
Brandon,
the food's spectacular.
It's a break?even business.
It's not franchisable yet.
You'd have to be making 15%
pre?tax to franchise.
You're a ways off for that.
Too early for me.
I'm out.
Alright. By the way,
you're more than welcome
to come back in if you want.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
I would love it,
'cause you're Mr. Wonderful.
Obviously,
your food is fabulous.
That meatball ??
I wasn't just saying ??
it's the best meatball
I've ever eaten.
The best meatball
I've ever eaten ?? by far, okay?
So I want that recipe.
Done.
Okay.
What does it cost you
to make one meatball?
About 45 cents.
Okay, Brandon,
here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna put in 100K,
Lori's gonna put up 50K.
We're gonna take 30%.
I'll keep 20 of it,
she'll keep 10.
Do we have a deal?
Alright, I'll do it.
Okay. Deal.
Corcoran: Wait a minute!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Greiner: Done.
I ?? Come on!
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, baby! Yeah!
[ Laughs ]
Yeah!
Now I'm gonna tell you
something, Brandon ??
you made a mistake here.
You had another deal
on the table,
