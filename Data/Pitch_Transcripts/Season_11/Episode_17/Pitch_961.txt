I'm Brandon Fay,
and I'm seeking $150,000,
10% equity of my company.
Sharks, when you want
to go eat Italian,
first thing
comes to your mind ??
"Oh, boy.
I gotta go to a restaurant.
Even with a reservation,
I'm gonna wait a while."
Then, the pasta's expensive,
and then by the time the pasta
finally comes, it's cold.
It's not even fresh pasta!
And that's why I started
my company, Pasta by Hudson.
We're a fast?casual,
quick?service, fresh pasta bar
located in the heart
of New York City!
So, you look at the menu.
Step 1 ?? pick a pasta shape,
like campanelle little bells
or bucatini.
[ Italian accent ]
Long?a pasta, like?a spaghetti.
[ Normal voice ]
We even have veggie pasta
if you don't want carbs.
Step 2 ?? pick a sauce!
We have a carbonara.
Ridiculously decadent,
creamy sauce
with a fried egg
sitting right on top,
smoked applewood bacon.
Or how about try
our popular alla vodka?
It's a sweet blend
of our hand?crushed tomato sauce
and Alfredo.
Oh, there's more!
Step 3 ??
grab an extra if you want,
everything from shrimp
to garlic toast,
burrata creamy mozzarella.
We've got our famous signature
cheesy stuffed meatball.
You can keep it simple,
you can mix it up.
You can eat it now,
you can eat it later.
Come on! Who wants to make
a lot of dough?!
Yeah!
Whoa!
Now, in front of you, you got
a lot of delicious pasta.
Let me tell you something ??
if you cook with love,
people can tell.
They know right away.
Ohh!
Mmm.
That is so good.
So, allow me, please.
Excellent.
Corcoran: This is fabulous.
Pomodoro ?? great.
What's this here?
Cuban:
Yeah. Gemelli pomodoro.
Oh, gosh.
Mmm!
Unh!
Oh, wow. The meatball.
Corcoran: My God.
Let me tell you ?? this is
the best meatball I've ever had.
Why don't you tell us
about you,
how you started this business,
and what you were doing before?
Well, first of all,
I'm the son
of two New York City
police officers.
My parents were actually
Bridge and Tunnel officers.
Really?
My dad was a sergeant.
But [Smooches] he's since gone,
but we love him and miss him
every day of my life.
Are you
an Italian extract?
You don't look Italian
at all.
I'm Jewish and Irish!
?Nice!
?Come on.
?Irish?
They make
the best Italian food.
Make the best Italian food.
Help me visualize
your operation.
Is it a store?
Is it a truck?
So, we actually have
a picture.
I can show you
what it looks like.
Good.
We've got 390 square feet.
It's one store?
It's one store right now.
Where is that located?
We're located
in Columbus Circle.
We're in the eighth?busiest
transit hub in New York City.
24 million people a year
go through there.
When I walk up here for lunch,
what am I spending?
So, your pomodoro starts
at $8.95.
Then the rest of the dishes,
about $12 to $13.
Are you a chef? How did you
come up with this idea?
So, no training experience.
I ran
one of the busiest restaurants,
not only in New York City,
but in pretty much
the United States.
You were the manager
of the restaurant?
I was managing director,
130 employees.
And then when you work in
a restaurant your
whole entire life ??
I'm almost 25 years
in the industry ??
you pick up a few things.
So, what are
your sales to date?
Year to date,
we're at about $590,000.
And your overhead
is what?
$55,000 a month.
Is that
your business model,
to continue opening
within food courts,
where the business
tends to come to you
because there's
so many people going by?
You hit the nail
on the head.
So, my business plan
is to open up
in very high?volume,
high?foot?traffic areas.
Are you profitable now?
By the end of the year,
we'll probably break even
on the first year.
By next year, I predict
that I'll at least do ??
I'll do 1.2, 1.3.
Is this gonna be expansion
of just you opening locations
or franchise or both?
I see us making sure
we build a foundation ??
really solid, right?
And yes, we do franchising ??
probably a little bit too early,
but that's something
we can always talk about.
What's it cost you
to open one?
So, this one was 350,
but we learned a lot,
and when I was looking
at possibly doing,
like, a smaller kiosk, that one
would have been, like, 200.
Everything gets more efficient.
So, 350
to get the doors open.
Brandon...
Yes, sir?
...I think
it's a genius idea,
but I have
a personal issue
on why this may be
a challenge for me.
I have horrible acid reflux.
Horrible.
So, you know,
I can't have onions,
I can't have tomato base.
This is like kryptonite
to me,
even though
it was delicious.
So, unfortunately, I'm out.
Totally understand.
Cuban: Do you guys do
delivery at all
or have an app
where people can pick?
The blend of my business right
now is actually half of that ??
almost half is delivery.
That's good, though, right?
It <i>is</i> good.
What we're learning is, they do
take a big commission, right?
Yeah, they take
20, 25%, yeah.
Yeah.
Does that make sense
for you?
I am so thankful for
the business they've given me
because it's huge.
It opens you up to
a larger market a mile away,
people that have never
even known I'm there.
It's about where am I
going in the future and how
big I'm gonna grow this.
Well, and let's talk about
future, right?
Because, really, your biggest
future is delivery?only.
Like, if I knew that you had
spaghetti squash on there,
this size with that sauce,
and it was 250 calories,
I'm ordering every night.
And they've got
the place ??
you know, CloudKitchen
and the places like that,
where you just have the kitchen,
they do the rest.
I mean, would you be open to
doing just a CloudKitchen?
Satellite kitchens.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
'Cause then you have
more of a market going
in other directions.
You're not there ??
much lower rent
because those places
aren't storefronts.
And you can go to more cities
more often, quicker.
Correct.
Brandon,
the food's spectacular.
It's a break?even business.
It's not franchisable yet.
You'd have to be making 15%
pre?tax to franchise.
You're a ways off for that.
Too early for me.
I'm out.
Alright. By the way,
you're more than welcome
to come back in if you want.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
I would love it,
'cause you're Mr. Wonderful.
Obviously,
your food is fabulous.
That meatball ??
I wasn't just saying ??
it's the best meatball
I've ever eaten.
The best meatball
I've ever eaten ?? by far, okay?
So I want that recipe.
Done.
Okay.
What does it cost you
to make one meatball?
About 45 cents.
And what do you
sell them for?
$4.95.
Wow.
Do they freeze well?
Oh, yes. I froze them
and shipped them here.
Youse two can partner
together...
It would be great...
...and we could crush this.
I have a deal for you.
Listen to this.
We could crush this.
Hey, be quiet a minute.
I have a deal for you.
Alright, listen,
if Mark will do it,
I'd go in with Mark.
While they're going in
with Mark,
let me suggest
what I'll do.
Yes, please.
Okay? Alright.
Mark.
I'll give you the $150,000
for 50%.
Say that number again.
I couldn't hear you.
I'll give you $150,000
for 50%
of your meatball business
if you'll get it online.
You can make a fortune.
[ Laughing ]
Just online meatballs?
That's an amazing offer.
The fact that you even
gave me an offer ?? believe
me, that's wonderful.
Would you mind if I hear
what Lori and Mark have to say?
I don't mind at all.
Help yourself.
And I'm considering that.
I only like the meatballs.
I'm considering everything
because ??
Are you interested
in going in together?
Cuban: I want 20%.
Well, Mark wants 20%,
which means,
what is that
going to be left for me?
Right?
So, I'm gonna ??
[ Italian accent ]
A meatball.
[ Italian accent ]
A meatball.
Mark, is that 20%
10, 10?
No. I need to get to 20.
No, he doesn't want that.
He wants 20% himself.
What does that
leave for me?
Well, let me ask you
something ?? if, hypothetical,
if I gave you both 15,
and you know I know operations,
you know I know food,
and I'm gonna crush it,
are you gonna help me
blow this thing up?
Yeah, look, I'm not investing
to not help it grow.
Of course.
Right?
I'll give you the $150,000,
I want 20%,
and I have no problem
partnering with Lori.
The only thing
that I require
is that we seriously consider
the CloudKitchens,
'cause that allows us to go into
as many markets as you want.
If Lori wants to come in
and negotiate something
on top of that,
I'm kosher with that.
Well, I liked your $150,000,
15 and 15.
Why wouldn't you
do that, Mark?
What do you mean?
Did you hear that?
Because that's actually
a very good offer to us.
Not to me.
Oh, come on. 5%?
Seriously.
Just take 10%, then,
Lori.
But we ?? 10%.
How much of my money are you
offering him for the 10%?
Okay, Brandon,
here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna put in 100K,
Lori's gonna put up 50K.
We're gonna take 30%.
I'll keep 20 of it,
she'll keep 10.
Do we have a deal?
Alright, I'll do it.
Okay. Deal.
Corcoran: Wait a minute!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Greiner: Done.
I ?? Come on!
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, baby! Yeah!
[ Laughs ]
Yeah!
Now I'm gonna tell you
something, Brandon ??
you made a mistake here.
You had another deal
on the table,
and you never even
entertained it.
And, listen, I'm
unbelievably grateful that
you even made an offer,
but I know that I
got a great team here,
I know I'm gonna crush it.
Go make us some money.
No more sucking up.
I'm gonna start cooking!
Go cook.
Whoo! Whoo!
Yes! Whoo!
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Feeling awesome!
Are you kidding me?
Dreams come true,
especially in the Shark Tank.
Worked my entire life, so hard,
and I'm sitting here
partnering up with two of
the best people in the business.
There's no doubt we're gonna
take the business from here
and just explode it and just do
amazing things with it.
How about you guys give me an
option on the meatball business?
What's the big deal?
It's added revenue
for the whole business.
No, 'cause we want
that meatball business.
We trust your judgment,
Barb.
You ?? [ Exhales sharply ]
Whatever.
