Sharks, who's ready to join us
unleash the power of small?
[ Chuckles ]
We've given you
two different types.
One is a "Welcome home" set
for babies
that are going to be
coming home from the hospital.
Really cool packaging.
?Thank you.
?Smart. Super smart.
?Thank you.
?It's amazing how common sense
just has, you know,
the most amazing impact.
Oh, you have no idea
how many nurses
have come to us in all
these NICU conferences
that we've gone to, said,
"I had this idea years ago."
[ Chuckles ]
I have a 3?year?old,
but when she came home,
for probably about
the first six months,
we were wondering why
she had all these scratches
on her ankle.
We just didn't think that
her toenails were cutting her.
People think, "Oh, sure,
we'll just buy a nail?cutter,
John: But one second.
I'm astonished
they're so low.
So, back in the day,
it was a really heavy
wholesale business.
O'Leary: What is this year
gonna be, total sales?
2 1/2.
What are you gonna make
on it?
About 15% profitability.
We've been profitable
since year 1.
You've put this ??
$1 million for 8%.
That imbues
a $12.5 million valuation.
That's a little rich.
That's a <i>lot</i> rich.
It's a little rich.
However, we did
our first fundraising round
back in early 2018.
We were at $1 million
in sales.
We had a post money
at $5 million valuation then.
Yeah, but you've
only doubled sales.
There's a sucker born
every minute.
I bet those suckers are
scratching their face.
But we're growing.
We have
a clear line of sight
for $5 million business
next year.
Why aren't sales more?
It's a wholesale business,
largely.
That's where we came from.
so that my products
could be enjoyed by all.
While I love what you're doing,
it's not the right model for me.
Sorry. I'm out.
Yeah, I think you're trying
to tell two stories, right?
A luxury...
Mm?hmm.
the great job
that you've already done.
The product's excellent.
But the valuation
is just...crazy.
Okay, so let's talk about
a proper valuation
at what you think is fair.
O'Leary: Well, that's what
I've been trying to do
since you started your pitch.
It's just ??
John: You know what?
It ?? I can't hurt to ask.
$1 million for...
30%.
Cuban: Hello.
Mm.
O'Leary: That's about right.
That's a very big leap.
That's about
what it's worth right now.
I should be in this space
because I already own
the wedding space.
Mm?hmm.
It's a perfect connection.
What happens
when people get married?
They have babies.
They have babies.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Joe Balistreri.
I'm from Shohola, Pennsylvania,
You know what, Joe?
I can tell you a couple things.
One, it's obvious
you know your stuff, right?
John:
Are you interested, Kev?
You have anything else in
your portfolio for pest control?
I don't have a Critter Pricker
in my portfolio.
[ Claps hands ]
Thank you, Joe.
Greiner: Congrats, Joe.
Let's go make some money,
my friend.
Cuban: Congrats, Joe, man.
I think it's terrific.
Great idea.
?Thank you, guys, for your time.
Well done, Joe.
Well done.
My name is Katey Jo Evans, and
I'm from Bridgeville, Delaware.
I had always dreamed of more
growing up.
I had big dreams
of making my hometown proud
somehow, someway.
When I was in high school,
I saw an ad in the newspaper
for Miss Delaware
National Teen Pageant,
My name is Katey Jo Evans,
Absolutely.
John: Man. It's good.
Oh, wow! The orange creamsicle
was really good.
Katey Jo, where do you
sell this? <i>How</i> do you sell it?
So, we sell our products
in 70 grocery chain stores.
Giant Foods
is our major grocery buyer.
It <i>is</i> impressive,
Katey Jo.
I think probably
the most underestimated value
in every great entrepreneur
that I've ever worked with
is their ability
to make great judgments.
Because there's two, three,
four, five ways
of doing everything
all along the way.
The concern I have
for what your gift is,
which is enthusiasm
Wait, wait. Katey Jo, the
ice cream business is so hard.
You have to convince
all these grocers or retailers
to give you
refrigerated space.
But I really don't.
Our retail space
has been given to us.
Why is that? Is it
'cause you're already
in business with them?
They know the quality
of our produce.
Their customers
are coming in saying,
"I want Evans Farms produce.
It's the best in the world."
But that's local
'cause they know you, Katey Jo.
You get the edge
because it's a great product
John: You know what?
Yeah, Katey Jo, the problem is,
to Daymond's point,
refrigerated's hard.
Frozen's even worse.
Because there's
even less space available.
Guys, I love hard.
I have no doubt, right?
I was born for hard.
Look, Katey Jo, what you've
accomplished is great.
What I don't think
you have a grasp on
is what it's gonna take
to scale nationally.
I know you want a fight. It's
not a fight I want to fight.
Katey Jo, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you. Congrats.
Katey Jo,
I love the misfit fruit ideas.
These are rejected
by their peers.
It's great.
That strawberry
got kicked off the branch.
[ Laughs ]
I look at it as a very difficult
business to invest in
'cause of its structure.
Mr. Wonderful, you don't like
easy stuff, either.
No, no, no.
You're up for the challenge.
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.
Katey Jo has
only two more chances for a deal
if we can land
a major national chain
with the product.
Well, it's good
you said that,
I wouldn't think about it
too long, Katey Jo.
Yes. Like a Wegmans ??
Lori, I will do that deal
with you!
I'm sorry! I know
I'm supposed to negotiate!
[ Laughter ]
I'm sorry!
Aaah!
Oh, my!
[ Laughs ]
Congratulations, Katey Jo.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you all for your time.
O'Leary:
Thank you very much.
This has been truly an honor.
Oh, it's heavy!
To wear the crown
is a huge responsibility.
Getting this deal today means
everything to our business.
I mean, who would have ever
thought in a million years
that a farmer's wife
from Bridgeville, Delaware,
