My name's Jason Richardson,
Love this pattern.
Richardson: That's one of
our best sellers.
John: Jason,
I got a question for you.
Yeah.
Why would anybody
play golf?
?Aw, Daymond!
?Oh, Daymond!
I mean, like,
I <i>hate</i> golf!
I've heard that
from so many people.
Golf has a history
of being boring.
It's dull.
It's overly proper.
But golf is becoming
more popular
for the younger generation.
But you don't need to golf
to wear this.
No, you don't.
But that's my point, right,
'cause this is ??
They are performance,
so these are made performance
for on the course.
They have all the technical
features of any other golf polo.
But they're
cool?looking shirts.
?Thanks. Yeah.
?I love golf. It's wonderful.
I'm good for
the first two hours.
After that, I'm like,
"I can't believe I'm
out here for five hours."
Yeah.
There is a lot of stuff
like this in the market.
There's several companies
in golf
that have targeted
the older golfer,
Herjavec: Jason,
I don't see it like that.
Thanks for the offer.
I think when you're hot,
you got to stay hot.
I don't know how this all became
completely about retail.
No, no.
To me, it's like you said.
I'm riding the wave.
O'Leary:
So, you have two offers, Jason.
What do you want to do?
Jason is seeking $300,000
for a 10% stake
in his modern golf shirt
business, Bad Birdie.
Richardson:
Decent form.
Ohhhhh!     Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhh!                  Ohhhhh!
You suck!
Two losers!
[ Laughs ]
Congrats, guys.
Good luck.
Let's go, baby!
Whoo! Whoo!
Robert's gonna bring
a lot to the company.
Just the fact that
he believed in me enough
to risk 5% is amazing.
