Thank you very much,
Lola.
You're welcome.
Lori.
Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful
is getting white.
He is pure
as the driven snow.
He is pure, yeah.
Lola, it looked complicated,
even when she did it.
?No.
?No?
?No, that was easy.
It's hard to know that, though,
Lola, from looking at it.
Because it's very small
in the representation.
I wouldn't know that.
Well, Lola,
tell us about <i>you,</i> okay?
So,
what's your background?
Okay, Lola,
we don't live in the past.
Thank you.
We do not live
in the past.
?Now we're judging you.
?Listen to Lola.
This is important.
Don't get stuck on the numbers.
Listen to me.
Lola, your sales ??
[ Laughter ]
You aren't gonna like it.
Your sales suck!
It's okay.
I've been bootstrapping.
On this, I've spent like
$91,000 ?? all my own money.
Lola,
this is a quality product,
but for me, respectfully,
it's not a product for me,
but I wish you the best.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Lola, you deserve
a ton of credit, right?
Thank you.
What you've accomplished
is amazing.
Your relentlessness
is amazing.
Thank you.
Your sales ??
not so much.
Yeah, but ??
Right?
But it's telling you
something.
Honestly,
I'm not a marketing expert,
but I said,
"I'm not gonna stop, you know?"
You've got $91,000 of your own
money that you've spent.
You don't have enough money
for marketing.
You know, I don't want
to keep saying this,
but it is what it is.
I haven't been able
to give this product
Herjavec:
Lola, I, um...
There's a great saying ??
I forget where I saw it ??
"Every time you see somebody
with a small business..."
Yeah.
"...somebody made
a courageous decision."
Yes.
So I admire
your courage.
Thank you.
You are in love
with the romantic idea
of starting a business.
But my money's
got to go somewhere
in order to get back
an investment.
Lola, you're going through
the same thing
a lot of entrepreneurs
go through...
Okay.
...where they have
a great product
Lola, self?awareness is key
for every entrepreneur.
Absolutely.
We all lie to ourselves ??
some more than others.
You're in the "more" category
right now.
You've got to get
to the "less" category.
[ Scoffs ]
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Good luck.
Thank you.
?Okay.
?Good luck, Lola.
?Thank you, guys.
?Good luck, Lola.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Lola: I think the Sharks were
hung up on my sales numbers,
but I know that all I need
is just one breakthrough
