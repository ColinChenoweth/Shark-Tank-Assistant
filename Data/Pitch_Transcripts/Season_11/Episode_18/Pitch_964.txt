My name's Jason Richardson,
and I'm from
Los Angeles, California.
Today, I'm looking for $300,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company, Bad Birdie.
Now, before we talk about
the birdie,
unfortunately,
we have to talk about the bad.
You walk into any golf store,
pro shop,
search any online retailer,
and you're gonna see
these basic options
for golf polos ??
solid colors
or, if you're feeling
a little bit more edgy,
you can go
with the stripes.
Guys, get out of here.
O'Leary: Wow. Bye.
?Aww.
?Aww.
As you can see,
most options are safe,
they're unoriginal,
and they're based on
the outdated, overly proper,
boring golf culture
of the past.
So meet Bad Birdie.
Bad Birdie makes
performance golf polos
with the freshest,
the most fun styles
that make you stand out
on the course.
They're moisture?wicking,
anti?odor, antimicrobial,
and they offer
sun protection.
They fit amazing,
and they just look sick,
baby!
[ Laughs ]
People are loving it,
and we cannot keep up
with the demand.
So, Sharks,
who's looking to pour
a little bit of fuel
on this fire
and blow this thing up?
Let's go, baby!
Sharks, there's some polos
for each of you guys.
Herjavec: Alright.
Oh, I love this.
Love this pattern.
Richardson: That's one of
our best sellers.
John: Jason,
I got a question for you.
Yeah.
Why would anybody
play golf?
?Aw, Daymond!
?Oh, Daymond!
I mean, like,
I <i>hate</i> golf!
I've heard that
from so many people.
Golf has a history
of being boring.
It's dull.
It's overly proper.
But golf is becoming
more popular
for the younger generation.
But you don't need to golf
to wear this.
No, you don't.
But that's my point, right,
'cause this is ??
They are performance,
so these are made performance
for on the course.
They have all the technical
features of any other golf polo.
But they're
cool?looking shirts.
?Thanks. Yeah.
?I love golf. It's wonderful.
I'm good for
the first two hours.
After that, I'm like,
"I can't believe I'm
out here for five hours."
Yeah.
There is a lot of stuff
like this in the market.
There's several companies
in golf
that have targeted
the older golfer,
those that are, say,
40 and up.
Tell us what your plan is
to gain market share.
What's the plan?
To give you guys
some context,
I started this company
2 1/2 years ago.
I walked into a golf store,
and I was trying to find
something cool,
and I was like, "There's
got to be someone out there
that wants to buy
a shirt like this."
I have no background
in apparel,
no idea
how to make a golf polo,
so I just started Googling,
"How do I make a golf polo?"
[ Laughter ]
So, I just started making
as many calls as I can,
hustling, figuring it out.
Spent 20,000
of my own dollars.
In the first year,
I did $72,000.
?Wow!
?Good for you.
?Good for you.
The second year,
I sold $412,000.
$412,000 in sales?
$412,000.
This year, to date,
I'm at $760,000.
I should close the year
at $1.2 million.
Wow!
And we'll close
at $1.2 million.
Hustler, hustler.
I like it.
So, my sales go like this.
You're all online?
It's all online
until this last year.
But just so you have
context of sales,
when I release these polos,
I have loyal customers that buy
within the first hour
they come out.
And my problem has been
I continually sell out,
and I'm reinvesting cash flow
into it
to be able to buy inventory,
and I keep hitting
that max level.
So they wait for
your drop date, right?
Yeah, so, it depends
on the shirts.
Generally, I do drops
every two months.
If it's a superhot seller ??
like, example, this one
right here is called Wildlife.
That was just launched
a month ago,
and it sold so well
within the first hour
that it's gonna move into
our best sellers category.
That's my favorite.
How many new designs a year
are you gonna drop?
Per season,
I do about 30 designs.
And then, on top of that,
I do limited?edition runs.
Who does the design?
I started doing them all myself
with graphic designers.
Now I've basically
built a team
of probably 10 or so designers
that I work with.
What does it cost
to manufacture,
and what do you
sell it for?
So, I sell these polos
for $72.
I started making them
for $40.
Now I make them for $25,
and my next run
coming from overseas
is coming in for $17.
Wow.
And within the next six months,
I should be able
to get that down
to about $12.
Where do you make them now?
Here?
So, right now I've made them
all in L. A.
Last year,
I started selling wholesale.
So far this year, we've done
about $150,000 of wholesale.
By the end of this month,
I'll have $300,000
committed for next year.
Why do you feel that you need
to expand in retail
if you're doing so well
online?
Yeah,
I think I want to do that
because it's an opportunity
and it helps grow the brand.
And each shirt is gonna have
a run of how many?
For next year, I'll probably be
doing 1,000 to 2,000 per shirt.
Okay,
the reason I ask that,
as opposed to going
to retail, right...
Yeah.
...every kid right now,
every Millennial, Gen Z, right,
you're trained by shoes,
right,
that the drop date
is <i>the</i> date.
Mm?hmm.
Jordan XXXIV ??
when's it gonna hit, right?
Everybody's
waiting in line.
When you told me
you were doing that,
I'm like,
"That's brilliant."
Yeah.
Because that's
what connects you...
Yeah.
...to golfers
that are 30 and under.
Now, the minute you've got
those same lines
in a retail store...
Yeah.
...there's nobody
waiting in line.
They're not gonna
sell out.
Do you see
the difference there?
I 100% see the difference.
What you've got right now is
this incredible momentum online
at full?margin
cash flow...
You're killing it.
...on these drops.
Thank you. Yeah.
And we see ??
you've got to believe us ??
we see
so many apparel deals...
Totally.
...where the guys
get buried!
Been there, done that.
It sucks.
This conversation has gone
a lot about retail.
I'm only projecting
to keep retail
at like 25% or less
of my business.
That's not the point.
It's not the percentage, right?
It's the relationship
with the buyer.
If you already paid $72,
you can pay $99, right?
Yeah.
If you can pay $99,
you can pay $129.
When those drops
are limited...
Yeah.
So, I just want to jump in here
for a minute.
Yeah.
Your shirts ??
you walked in here,
and you said the reason
why you did all of this ??
this is
your niche market ??
is because everything's boring
out there, right?
Yeah. Totally.
So, if that's true,
if your competition
is boring,
anywhere you then put
your shirts
amidst the sea
of "dull"...
Yeah.
...you're gonna pop
and stand out.
100%.
That's a really good point.
And people are gonna
gravitate to it.
Yeah.
So you can do it all,
so to speak.
Yep.
Anyway, I think that
some of my fellow Sharks
are more interested
in investing in a golf shirt
than I am.
I just don't find that it's
the right investment for me,
so I'm sorry ??
I'm out.
Thanks, Lori.
I appreciate that.
I was looking at this,
saying,
there is no way in hell
I'd put $300,000 into apparel,
where there is
so much competition.
But sales don't lie.
Here's my offer ??
I'll give you $300,000.
I <i>forbid</i> you
to go to retail.
I don't care
what Lori says.
$300,000 for 30%.
But zero retail.
Zero retail
to take that offer?
Do you know why?
You have to beg to get
that shirt on the drop date ??
beg like a dog for it.
Herjavec: Jason,
I don't see it like that.
Thanks for the offer.
I think when you're hot,
you got to stay hot.
I don't know how this all became
completely about retail.
No, no.
To me, it's like you said.
I'm riding the wave.
And you know what?
When the wave crests,
you can always pull back.
We have a great investment in
a company called Butter Cloth.
We're all online,
about $3.5 million.
But I like this
because it's all about
targeting your customer.
That's great.
I'll give you the $300,000
for 25%.
And you're a smart guy.
I won't forbid you
to sell more anywhere.
You'll figure it out, and I
think we can really help you.
Okay.
Cuban: As much as
I like the concept,
retail always scares me.
Totally.
I will tell you,
jack up your prices, bro.
If you're selling out...
Sell it more. Yeah.
...you're selling
too cheap.
Yeah.
I'm excited for you.
It's just not
a fit for me right now.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Appreciate it, Mark.
Let me tell you something ??
retail is about real estate.
They start charging you
for hanging fees.
Yep.
You have to sell it
at half the price
that you sold online,
right?
They pay you
in 30, 60, maybe 90 days.
They return goods
they don't like.
It is horrible.
I don't want to put
that pressure on you. I'm out.
O'Leary:
So, you have two offers, Jason.
What do you want to do?
Jason is seeking $300,000
for a 10% stake
in his modern golf shirt
business, Bad Birdie.
Richardson:
Decent form.
Ohhhhh!     Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhh!                  Ohhhhh!
You suck!
Two losers!
[ Laughs ]
Congrats, guys.
Good luck.
Let's go, baby!
Whoo! Whoo!
Robert's gonna bring
a lot to the company.
Just the fact that
he believed in me enough
to risk 5% is amazing.
He understands the whole
conversation about retail.
He's grown other brands
before. It's just gonna
be an epic journey.
