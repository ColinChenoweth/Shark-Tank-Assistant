Hey, Sharks.
My name is Ryan.
This is my brother Eric
and my best friend, Kev.
And we're
the MUVEZ team.
And we're seeking
a $200,000 investment
for a 15% equity stake
in our company.
Sharks,
I don't know about you,
but when guests enter my home
and keep their shoes on,
it drives me crazy.
Oh, yeah. He gets really,
really incensed about it.
"Shoes, bro!"
You're tracking in
dirt, bacteria, and
who else knows what?
He's right, so for Eric,
we make sure
we wear our slippers
around the house.
They're great and all,
but if I have to run
outside for a quick trip,
like taking out the trash
or walking the dog,
I'm gonna have
to find my shoes,
put on socks, tie laces.
I just want to go.
If it was up to me,
I would leave the house
and then come right back.
Shoes, bro!
?[ Laughs ]
?So to fix this common problem,
we created
MUVEZ Footwear.
MUVEZ Footwear is the only
footwear on the market
with dual?sole
technology.
?Oh, my God!
?Nice.
So now Eric can keep
his floors clean
and Ryan can transition
to an outdoor shoe
in one easy step.
While he's out and about
in his MUVEZ,
he's both comfortable
and stylish.
No one even knows
he's in his house slippers.
We engineered the MUVEZ
to hold on tight,
whether he's walking, running,
or even jumping.
?Whoo!
?There it is. There it is.
Give it to him.
Eric: The coolest thing about
having removable outsoles
is they're all completely
interchangeable.
Now changing
the look and feel of your shoe
has never been easier.
Zamora: So, Sharks, who's ready
to join the movement
and help the world
move easy?
?Wow.
?Can we try the MUVEZ?
Of course.
Thank you, guys.
We actually
set you all up
with your own
personal pair of MUVEZ.
Ryan: So, please pull
the pull tab in front of you.
Lift it up.
Eric: Yeah, Robert,
we made yours red
to match
one of your racecars.
Lori, the closest thing
we had to white for the queen
was our stone gray.
Cuban: You gave me
Carolina blue?
No. [ Laughs ]
You gave me Carolina blue?
Look at the side of the box,
Mark, on the other side.
It's in the front.
We actually named it...
After you and your team.
Mavericks blue?
Um, Carolina blue.
Ryan: [ Laughing ]
You're right. You're right.
Daymond,
those are our most popular
Eric: Like you would
with your normal shoes.
Then lift forward.
?There you go.
?There it is.
Zamora: Yeah, so,
the back is designed
for when you want to move
a little bit more,
so it's
an elastic heel counter.
?That's cool.
?What do you think, Daymond?
?I think they're cool.
?Thank you.
John:
The design is cool, too.
We focused very much
on the design itself.
What do you
sell them for?
$110,
and they include shipping.
And what's
your cost to land?
$26.
That's good.
And what have you sold?
So, we've done $73,000 in sales
since April,
with practically
zero marketing spent.
?Online? All online?
?Online.
So, basically, majority
of our sales are e?commerce,
so it goes through
our social?media channels.
What we're doing in
the second phase of the business
is allowing the customers to buy
the outer soles separately.
Cuban: Right.
So now you're building
your collection.
How much does it cost
you to make one, and what
would you sell it for?
Just the outsole is $8.
$8? Right. And you can sell it
for $19 or $29 or whatever?
?Yeah. Exactly.
?Right.
So that's where your
real money's gonna come from.
Ryan: Yeah.
But there could be an add?on
during the checkout process.
This is cool as hell.
Zamora: It's been a really big
impulse purchase,
but the best part
about it is,
we have a less than 2%
return rate.
Tell me about your challenges
you had when creating this.
Where do we start?
Yeah.
Well, we traveled
to China twice.
Our first factory,
after financing samples
and mold costs
and material sourcing,
they were about three
to four months into it,
and they told us that
the project was impossible.
It couldn't be done.
It could not be done.
So we, honestly,
truth be told,
we purchased supplies
from an over?the?counter
hardware store,
brought them to our garage
in New Jersey...
Nice.
...where they casted my foot
as the mold.
And then that was our first
proof of concept with rubber.
Power of broke, baby.
That's it, yeah.
That's all it is.
It wasn't perfect,
but for us, it was beautiful,
and it was enough to present
to investors.
'Cause it showed
that it worked.
So, guys,
I'm not a slippers guy.
?Okay.
?Okay.
I'm not a "shoes, bro"
household, right?
[ Laughter ]
How are you gonna get
to the point where you
have enough people
where you can sell enough
that it matters?
Well, we're hoping to utilize
a platform of athletes,
because they have
hundreds of thousands,
if not millions, of followers
on Instagram.
Why are athletes
attracted to this?
Zamora: At first,
it was a big focus
to position ourselves
as the postgame footwear.
But I think
that's a different market.
Isn't that like ??
Well, it's athleisure.
A lot of people
actually have indoor slippers
and then outdoor slippers.
So they'll have
their pair of slippers
that they only wear
in their house.
I think that's
a New Jersey thing.
It's a very
cultural thing.
No, it's not. It's not. I know
a lot of people that do that.
People wear slippers
outside now.
Yeah.
So, what we're doing is,
we're pitching the comfort
and convenience,
but we're adding
functionality
and then, also, capitalizing
on the hygiene factor.
It's different.
There's no question
about it.
You walked in here
with something we
haven't seen before.
Absolutely.
And when it comes to shoes,
that's rare.
But to me,
it's not proven yet.
I admire what you're trying
to do, but it ??
Mr. O'Leary,
just to speak to that.
To me, this is a tough,
tough, tough business.
Yeah.
I don't find your valuation
crazy.
I find the <i>risk</i> crazy.
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Appreciate that. Thank you.
Guys, my challenge is not
the product or design.
I think we all loved it
up here.
I think
the branding part of it
is gonna be really,
really hard.
I wish you all the best,
'cause it's a fantastic product.
I just don't know how
you're gonna get it
to market like that
without burning
massive amounts of money.
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Appreciate your feedback.
Cuban: Yeah, guys,
I'm kind of in the same boat.
It's hard, and you guys
already know that.
And I don't even think
it's about the amount of money.
It's just ??
It's gonna be a slog.
I just don't have an angle
where I can just walk in
and say, "This is it."
And if I don't see
that angle
that I can just take ahold of
and run with it,
then it's just not a deal
for me.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Ryan: Thank you.
You know, for me,
as an investment ??
They're very cool.
Thank you.
As an investment for me,
I'm just not sure ??
Zamora: So, the way we see
you helping us
is definitely with your
expertise in QVC
and getting us
in front of the eyes.
Listen,
there's so many people
that do not want shoes
in the house.
?Oh, for sure.
?Absolutely.
If you can get another Shark
here to go in with me,
I'll go in.
But I'm gonna leave that
to you now.
?Oh, for sure.
?That's fair.
Herjavec: Daymond,
you're the only one left.
Lori may be interested
in Ryan, Eric, and Kevin's
removable?sole shoe company,
MUVEZ,
but wants to partner
with another Shark.
Herjavec: Daymond,
you're the only one left.
This is a ??
man, this is a tough one.
I love the design.
I love the product,
the ingenuity.
So I don't want to even
insult you with an offer.
Ryan: Would you be willing
to possibly go in with Lori?
Offering money
is never an insult, Daymond.
?Never an insult.
?We care more about ??
Never. Never be insulted
by money.
Alright, so,
I'm just letting you know,
the reason why
I would give you this offer
is because purely I would be
taking you someplace
to license this.
You do not want to do
this business yourself.
?Absolutely.
?100%.
You really don't want
to do this.
Zamora: And that's
the way we see it.
For us,
we're looking for, you know,
the Shark to partner with
to get that exit strategy.
It would be $200,000
for 1/3 of the company.
?Hello.
?1/3 of the company.
?Is Lori in on that deal?
?Is Lori?
Absolutely not.
Eric: It's just so that
we can have 10% remaining
in case
we run into a roadblock
and we have to raise
additional capital.
And we're in New Jersey.
We're a stone's throw away
from your headquarters.
He's never been to New Jersey.
He's in Manhattan.
?Really?
?Well, we'll come to you.
But we know where
your office is.
Yeah.
We know
where your office is.
[ Laughter ]
?"We've been stalking you."
?I'm just saying.
Did they frisk
these people here?
And they know
where you live.
[ Laughter ]
Alright.
Let's do it.
?Yes!
?Whoo!
?Let's go!
Let's go. Let's go.
Cuban: Congrats, guys.
That's awesome.
?Congrats, guys.
?Thank you so much.
Herjavec: Good job!
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
?Congrats.
O'Leary: He's the right Shark
for you guys.
Cuban: Good job, D. J.
That's a great deal.
[ Laughs ]
That was who we wanted,
too, man.
Eric:
Having Daymond on board,
we believe it can be
a global brand in a few years.
?Whoo!
?Whoo?hoo?hoo!
His licensing,
his manufacturing capabilities
will strengthen
and accelerate our growth,
and we couldn't be
happier.
Daymond is
our dream Shark.
It's a subscription service,
Kevin.
Every month,
they get these videos
that help them
along the path.
Do you have any data that says
the attrition rates on this?
Subscribers?
You sign people up at what
customer acquisition costs?
Well, first, tell us how
many subscribers you have...
How long do they stay?
...and how much they pay.
220 subscribers.
So,
what do you charge?
It's $15 a month
for a subscription.
$15 a month.
And how long
have you been selling it?
A little over two years.
Oh!
This is the best place to be
in America for entrepreneurship,
and I'll take them up on it
again.
Kevin?
Kevin didn't speak.
And then there's Kevin.
That's shocking, too.
No.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my God.
Never. No.
[ Laughs ]
I'm out.
Kevin has offered
$300,000 for 30%,
and Robert has offered
$300,000 for 25%.
O'Leary:
So, you have two offers.
I want you to know the great
story of Greek mythology,
the siren on the rocks.
[ Laughs ]
You know who that was?
It was a retailer.
It was retail.
I know, yeah.
I bring a discipline
to the business
because I have experience.
My family business years ago,
Kiddie Togs,
was children's clothing.
Retail was very damaging
to us.
Yes. Yes.
Kevin 100 years ago
was in clothing.
Kiddie Togs?
I'm in clothing <i>now</i>
for people your age.
My final point is,
who do you want
wearing your shirt ??
Kevin or me?
So, Robert,
let me ask you this ??
Yeah?
Are you willing to go down
to 20% on this?
No. No.
We know what this takes.
It's a partnership, and we
got to have at least 25%.
25%'s a little bit more than ??
you know,
that's doubling the equity
I was asking you for.
It's the Shark Tank.
What do you expect?
I know it's "Shark Tank," and
I'm here to make a deal, so ??
Stick to your guns.
Give me one second here.
I got a little something.
Okay.
Kevin, I bet
you won't sink that.
Watch this, you bozo.
I will bet you $5,000
to your favorite charity
or you give $5,000
to mine.
You know what?
No, no, no, no.
Greiner: Do it!
I'm gonna take another
5% from you.
[ Laughter ]
Let's see you do it,
Mr. O'Leary.
