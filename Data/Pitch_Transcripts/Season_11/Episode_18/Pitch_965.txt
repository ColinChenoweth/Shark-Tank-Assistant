I'm Lola, and I'm from
Los Angeles, California.
I'm here asking for $150,000
for 10% of my business, Beddley.
Sharks, let's face it ??
the duvet cover struggle
is real.
It's definitely one of the most
frustrating tasks ever.
First, you may have to crawl
your way into your cover.
[ Laughter ]
After that, trying to line up
all four corners
while somehow
getting out of this maze
is beyond me.
Now you're lost, confused,
disoriented
and almost cannot breathe.
[ Laughter ]
And when you finally
make it out alive,
you're left jumping up and down
on your bed
in hopes that your comforter
will magically line up.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
All of the sweat and hassle!
Making your bed does not
have to be challenging,
complicated, or stressful.
There's got to be a better way.
That's why I created
the easiest, fastest,
and most user?friendly
duvet cover ever known.
Introducing the Beddley.
Our signature
innovative duvet cover
has a three?sided opening
that makes inserting
or removing your duvet
a breeze like never before.
Simply unzip the three sides,
place your duvet on top,
straighten things out.
The Beddley duvet cover
is just very easy to use.
Even a child can handle it.
And, Sharks,
no need for crawling inside.
So, now she's gonna zip
the duvet cover up
using our signature
nylon zipper.
Zip, zip, zip.
So, no more stuffing, shoving,
or, you know, duvet gymnastics.
Ta?da! Good job.
With Beddley, it's so easy.
Yay!
Think about
how much time you saved
and what you can do
with that precious time.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to zip up this deal with me
and bring Beddley
to beds everywhere?
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
I have samples for you.
Thank you very much,
Lola.
You're welcome.
Lori.
Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful
is getting white.
He is pure
as the driven snow.
He is pure, yeah.
And Daymond.
John: Thank you.
Thank you.
And Mark.
Thank you, Lola.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Lola, it looked complicated,
even when she did it.
?No.
?No?
?No, that was easy.
Greiner:
That was very easy.
Lola: Lori gets it.
And it's not complicated at all.
How would I know that
from looking at the packaging?
Yeah, that's gonna be
my question.
Yeah.
Like,
if I'm in the store ??
Okay.
Or do you only sell
this online today?
Oh, right now
just online.
So, you have a video
demonstrating what we just saw?
On the website.
Absolutely.
John:
Yeah. On the website?
Because otherwise,
why would I know the
difference between this ??
Yeah, because
it's a demonstrable ??
Yeah, like, I wouldn't
have known to do that.
So, when you pick that up
on the retail shelf,
hopefully, you look
at that label,
and it tells you.
It has
a three?sided opening.
It's hard to know that, though,
Lola, from looking at it.
Because it's very small
in the representation.
I wouldn't know that.
Okay.
And you don't have anything
there that says that.
Okay.
Well, Lola,
tell us about <i>you,</i> okay?
So,
what's your background?
So, equipped with a degree
in chemistry and physics,
I'm originally from Nigeria,
so I immigrated to the U. S.
I ended up getting a job
in investment banking
on the technology side.
And then,
while working full time,
I went to Columbia
and got my MBA.
I've always had this
entrepreneurial yearning,
so I'm brainstorming,
what ideas can I ??
you know, what can I ??
So, then, I'm like,
"Every time I have to wash
my duvet cover,
for a king?size bed,
it's a pain."
And I'm not a lazy person,
but that was the one thing
I did not like doing.
I'm like, "No.
This has got to stop.
There's got to be a solution
to this."
So I looked.
I didn't find it.
So I decided
I'm gonna <i>make</i> one.
Everybody
has this problem...
Yeah. Yeah.
...if they've ever changed
their duvet cover.
Exactly.
So, what does it cost you
to make it,
and the units that you sold,
what did you sell them at?
Right now
it's made in the U. S.
Okay.
So our costs are very high,
and I know I can
get that down drastically.
Okay.
What are the costs?
So, right now
it's $57.50.
To make?
Yes.
And I know
I can get this down.
And you sell it for what?
$130, $140 average.
Well,
what are your sales?
Okay, so, I'm gonna
preface that with
do not judge me
by my sales.
Okay?
[ Laughter ]
We promise you we will not
judge you by your sales.
I <i>am</i> going to judge you
by your sales.
$150,000 for 10% imputes
a $1.5 million valuation.
It does.
'Cause you're an investment
banker. You know that.
I know. I know that.
Okay, so ??
But you know what?
I wasn't gonna let
sales that are not gonna be
pleasing to you...
Herjavec: They're not.
...stop me...
Uh?oh. Uh?oh.
...from getting here.
Yeah,
don't worry about it.
I'll just tell you
the sales.
So, our revenue from 2018,
because that was when
we really started to sell.
Before that, it was just
a few here and there.
Just for last year,
what were the sales?
$28,000.
Okay, Lola,
we don't live in the past.
Thank you.
We do not live
in the past.
?Okay, and so this year ??
?So, 2019, year?to?date?
Yeah.
2019 year?to?date
is about $12,000.
?Oh!
?Yeah!
?Whoo!
?Now we're judging you.
?Now we're judging you.
?Listen to Lola.
This is important.
Don't get stuck on the numbers.
Listen to me.
Lola, your sales ??
[ Laughter ]
You aren't gonna like it.
Your sales suck!
It's okay.
I've been bootstrapping.
On this, I've spent like
$91,000 ?? all my own money.
And because my budget
was so limited,
it wasn't gonna stop me,
so I hustled.
You didn't hustle enough.
Lola,
this is a quality product,
but for me, respectfully,
it's not a product for me,
but I wish you the best.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Lola, you deserve
a ton of credit, right?
Thank you.
What you've accomplished
is amazing.
Your relentlessness
is amazing.
Thank you.
Your sales ??
not so much.
Yeah, but ??
Right?
But it's telling you
something.
Honestly,
I'm not a marketing expert,
but I said,
"I'm not gonna stop, you know?"
You've got $91,000 of your own
money that you've spent.
You don't have enough money
for marketing.
You know, I don't want
to keep saying this,
but it is what it is.
I haven't been able
to give this product
the brand awareness
that it deserves.
Most of our customers,
they find us on Google...
Right, but, you know...
...and they don't even
search for long.
Herjavec:
Lola, I, um...
There's a great saying ??
I forget where I saw it ??
"Every time you see somebody
with a small business..."
Yeah.
"...somebody made
a courageous decision."
Yes.
So I admire
your courage.
Thank you.
You are in love
with the romantic idea
of starting a business.
But my money's
got to go somewhere
in order to get back
an investment.
Okay.
And today,
you didn't do a good job
of presenting that.
Oh, wow.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Lola, you're going through
the same thing
a lot of entrepreneurs
go through...
Okay.
...where they have
a great product
and they say to themselves,
"Well, I can't really sell
a lot of them.
It must mean I don't have
enough money for marketing.
And if I only had more money
for marketing,
I could build a brand.
And if I build a brand,
then everybody will
come rushing to me and buy it."
Except that never works.
Marketing dollars
never build brands.
Product satisfaction
and execution build brands.
I don't think
you've got it figured ??
But I've been
working hard on this.
Who doesn't?
I got it into Macy's!
Everybody works hard.
Greiner: Everybody does.
I got it into Macy's.
Who doesn't?
I got QVC interested.
Ha.
Lola, self?awareness is key
for every entrepreneur.
Absolutely.
We all lie to ourselves ??
some more than others.
You're in the "more" category
right now.
You've got to get
to the "less" category.
[ Scoffs ]
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Good luck.
Thank you.
?Okay.
?Good luck, Lola.
?Thank you, guys.
?Good luck, Lola.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Lola: I think the Sharks were
hung up on my sales numbers,
but I know that all I need
is just one breakthrough
and I can push this
into the millions.
This woman has an MBA.
She got an MBA.
Are you saying that
in a good way or a bad way?
I'm saying I'm not a fan
of MBAs anymore.
I got to tell you guys
something.
We've been together
10 years...
Herjavec: 11.
...and it's
the first time ever
in "Shark Tank" history
I was speechless.
[ Chuckles ]
All I could think of
was "No."
[ Laughs ]
