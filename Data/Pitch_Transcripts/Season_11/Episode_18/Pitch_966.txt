in the streetwear industry,
the all blacks.
I mean,
if one of the Sharks
Hello, Sharks!
My name is Phil Black.
Herjavec: Phil,
how do you make a living?
What do you do for a living,
if you don't mind me asking?
Yeah, I'm a firefighter.
?Oh, you are?
?You are?
I became a firefighter
after 9/11.
I've been so for 14 years.
?Good for you.
?Oh, wow.
?Thank you.
?Oh, my gosh!
He's, like, the best.
Black: I never even got to it
last time.
Phil, how do you make money
with this?
Why do you bring us
the stuff that doesn't work?!
Phil, Phil, Phil.
I'm gonna give you
another pass to come back.
Black: It's working, Mark.
220 subscribers?!
Phil,
what are your sales?
$150,000.
Your sales
are $150,000?
Over two years?
Over two years, yes.
How do you get there
with 220 subscribers?
Well, there's a combination ??
there's subscriber revenue,
there's my private
client revenue,
and I said, "Phil, you got
into Harvard Business School.
You got into Yale.
What does it take to have kids
who are competitive
for the college?admissions
process?"
So I started taking notes,
writing best practices,
writing lessons learned,
tips, strategies,
mind?set
from the Navy S. E. A. L. s,
professionalism
from Goldman Sachs,
Phil,
220 <i>is</i> horrible.
Phil, please, we all love you,
so come back.
And the next business
should be
"How to get on 'Shark Tank'
three times."
[ Laughter ]
?I will be back if need be.
?Thanks, guys.
?Beautiful family.
?I appreciate all the advice.
?I hope you come back.
?Good luck, Phil.
?Third time's the charm.
?Nice to meet you guys.
Congrats. Good job.
?Take care.
Black: Hey, listen,
I'm a former Navy S. E. A. L.,
...marketing is
really a black hole.
If you don't
figure it out now...
Mm?hmm.
...how are you gonna
figure it out with the money?
What do you expect
to come out of this?
But I've learned a lot.
I've seen a lot.
