in the streetwear industry,
the all blacks.
I mean,
if one of the Sharks
want to come up
and help demonstrate.
Just like you would
kick off your normal shoes,
like how you step on
the back of your shoes.
Zamora: Yeah, so, basically,
what you want to do
is when you come home
and you're entering your house,
you want to remove
the outer sole.
So you're gonna plant your toes
down firmly on the ground,
step on the back,
and then lift forward.
Hello, Sharks!
My name is Phil Black.
And if I look familiar,
it's because I stood right here
during Season 5,
when I pitched my FitDeck
Exercise Playing Cards.
?Ohhhhh!
?I remember you!
And although you passed on
investing in FitDeck,
Remember this?
I hope
I didn't make a mistake.
?[ Laughs ]
?He lied. [ Laughs ]
Well, Sharks, I am back.
And this time,
I've brought backup.
[ Laughter ]
These guys are the inspiration
behind my new business.
They also represent
my target market ??
actual users.
And if you look closely,
you might even guess that...
yes, they're my sons.
And they're here
to help me secure a deal
for my new business,
called PrepWell Academy.
PrepWell Academy is an online,
video?based mentoring program
that helps teenagers,
like these guys,
and their parents,
like me, navigate
the confusing and stressful
college?admissions process.
And, boy,
could we use the help.
Guidance counselors
are overwhelmed,
schools don't have
the curriculum,
parents don't have the time,
and students
aren't getting the advice
when they need it most.
And that's where
PrepWell Academy comes in.
Every week, PrepWellers get
a video from me on their phone,
giving them exact advice,
timely advice
to help them know exactly
what to do and when to do it,
starting in ninth grade.
Sharks, this advice that I'm
giving ?? it's not guesswork.
As you may recall, I have
cracked the code in getting into
some of the world's
most competitive programs.
It's my superpower!
And I share that superpower
with my students every week.
Today, my job is to ask you
by investing
in PrepWell Academy.
And for that,
I'm seeking $100,000
for 20% of the business.
Now, boys, head over,
assume your positions.
[ Laughter ]
And, Sharks,
I would like my sons to help me
demonstrate exactly
how this program works.
Kiefer, for instance,
as a freshman,
every week,
he's gonna take out his phone,
and he's gonna get a lesson
and learn things
like study habits ??
in this case,
how to take notes,
when to take notes,
and how to stay organized.
Then he'll move into
extracurricular activities ??
how to think about
afterschool clubs.
What about volunteer work?
What about sports?
Now, Col and Croix, on
the other hand, as sophomores,
they're gonna learn
a different set of lessons ??
things like how to avoid
the sophomore slump,
why colleges love leaders,
when to take the S. A. T.
or the A. C. T.
And these lessons
will continue week after week
through junior year
and senior year.
Now, Dexter ??
he's got a couple years to go
before he becomes
a PrepWeller,
and I don't think it's gonna
take much to convince him
to follow
in his brothers' footsteps.
But my job today
is to convince you
to invest in me
and PrepWell Academy.
So, who's got questions?
John: Why were we so ??
We see a lot of people,
of course.
I do remember that you had
an impressive background.
But can you run us through
that again?
I was a recruited athlete
coming out of high school.
I played basketball
for Yale University.
I was an investment banker
at Goldman Sachs.
That's what I remember.
Oh, that's right.
I was a Navy S. E. A. L. officer
and Navy S. E. A. L. instructor.
Yes.
Great. That's right.
Thank you for serving.
Greiner: Wow.
I have an MBA
from Harvard Business School.
And you have
one good?looking family.
[ Laughs ] Thank you.
He had all that,
and then you had
a deck of cards, right?
Yeah.
Now, let's just ask,
how did that go?
I'm glad you asked,
Daymond.
I kept going, I sold more,
and we actually became a pretty
attractive acquisition target,
and I sold the business
to a company on the East Coast
who had a fitness brand
that they were building,
and FitDeck
was the perfect match.
Herjavec: Phil,
how do you make a living?
What do you do for a living,
if you don't mind me asking?
Yeah, I'm a firefighter.
?Oh, you are?
?You are?
I became a firefighter
after 9/11.
I've been so for 14 years.
?Good for you.
?Oh, wow.
?Thank you.
?Oh, my gosh!
He's, like, the best.
Black: I never even got to it
last time.
Phil, how do you make money
with this?
Why do you bring us
the stuff that doesn't work?!
Phil, Phil, Phil.
I'm gonna give you
another pass to come back.
Black: It's working, Mark.
220 subscribers?!
Phil,
what are your sales?
$150,000.
Your sales
are $150,000?
Over two years?
Over two years, yes.
How do you get there
with 220 subscribers?
Well, there's a combination ??
there's subscriber revenue,
there's my private
client revenue,
and then we have
a journal that we sell.
I'd like to know
how you came up with this idea.
Sure.
I came up with the idea
after I sold
the FitDeck business.
I had a little time
on my hands,
and I would see consistently
parents bickering
about this
college?admissions stuff.
"How did Sally not get into
a school with a 4.9 GPA?"
"What should Billy do
for extracurriculars?"
And I got pulled into
one of these conversations,
and I said, "Phil, you got
into Harvard Business School.
You got into Yale.
What does it take to have kids
who are competitive
for the college?admissions
process?"
So I started taking notes,
writing best practices,
writing lessons learned,
tips, strategies,
mind?set
from the Navy S. E. A. L. s,
professionalism
from Goldman Sachs,
and the list got long.
Then I went back to school
to get credentialed
in college?admissions
counseling,
and I put
these two things together,
and I started coaching
and mentoring kids.
I have to tell you,
sitting here, like,
I think it all seems
very, very smart.
I think that there's
just one problem.
It's hard to get people
to buy into something
that's that long,
that many months,
at that price.
I feel like if it was more
of, like, a crash course
or a course they bought <i>once,</i>
then they could buy in.
It's easier.
You know, you get more,
cheaper price point.
But to me, I don't relate to it
in this model.
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Here's my view ??
I remember you last time.
It was unbelievably
impressive.
You have a passion,
and it keeps you going ??
keeps you going
maybe past a point
where you shouldn't.
Two years
with 220 users ??
it's ?? it's not great.
I admire the mission,
and I applaud you for all
the other things you're doing,
but I'm out.
I don't see this business.
Phil,
220 <i>is</i> horrible.
And I just want to say,
as I said last time,
you're a really,
really great guy
with a really, really bad idea
this time.
This is horrible.
You're in
the top one percentile
of people that have
come on "Shark Tank."
Nobody gets invited back.
But because of the service
you've given your country
and your fantastic family
and what a great guy you are,
[ Laughs ]
But next time,
it's three strikes
and you're out.
Come back
with something better.
This sucks.
I'm out.
Phil, please, we all love you,
so come back.
And the next business
should be
"How to get on 'Shark Tank'
three times."
[ Laughter ]
?I will be back if need be.
?Thanks, guys.
?Beautiful family.
?I appreciate all the advice.
?I hope you come back.
?Good luck, Phil.
?Third time's the charm.
?Nice to meet you guys.
Congrats. Good job.
?Take care.
Black: Hey, listen,
I'm a former Navy S. E. A. L.,
and I'm never gonna give up.
I can see myself
pushing this thing
for the next couple years
and seeing it through, like
I did with FitDeck last time,
and coming back.
I'm a serial entrepreneur.
...marketing is
really a black hole.
If you don't
figure it out now...
Mm?hmm.
...how are you gonna
figure it out with the money?
What do you expect
to come out of this?
But I've learned a lot.
I've seen a lot.
And then I can also ??
I need help.
I can get help.
I think it's a genius idea.
You know what?
You're doing something
that's very important.
You're saving people time,
right?
And that's a lot of times
why people purchase something.
I just don't think
you've figured it out yet,
so I'm out.
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
