My name is David Scharfman,
and I'm from Madison, Wisconsin.
I grew up in a family
of cheesemakers.
My mom and dad bought
a little cheese company in 1991.
Growing up around a cheese
company was a lot of fun.
I got to go out on demos,
selling cheese,
handing out samples.
When I was 16, I started working
in the factory,
doing jobs that no one else
wanted to do.
My dad wanted everyone to know
that I wasn't getting
any special treatment.
Eventually,
I graduated into sales jobs
that didn't require a hairnet.
I loved working
at my parents' cheese company,
but I wanted to set out
on my own path.
I tried my hand at bringing
Wisconsin cheese to Asia,
but that ultimately failed.
So then I tried to <i>make</i>
Wisconsin cheese in Asia,
and that also failed.
I applied to business school.
After I graduated, I became
a consultant in New York City.
Ultimately wanted to be back
in small business,
and that's when my wife and I
had a great idea,
and all roads
lead back to cheese.
I need an investment
from the Sharks
to get more people
to try my product.
As soon as people try it,
they love it,
they keep buying it.
My family and I have invested
over a million dollars in this.
If this product fails, a lot
of people will lose their jobs,
a lot of people will lose money.
It's important for me
to make sure I justify
the risk my dad took on me.
I want to make him proud
and turn this risk
into a huge success.
Hi.
My name is David Scharfman,
and I'm the owner of
Just The Cheese.
And I'm asking for
a half a million dollars
for 5% of my business.
Wow.
Now, I know
what you're thinking.
A half million dollars
is a lot of cheddar!
Ha?ha!
And you're right.
But our business is cheese,
our cheese is delicious,
and our business is booming.
So, you know when you make
a grilled cheese sandwich,
the best part is the cheese
that melts off into the pan
and gets crunchy?
Well, most people look at that
and think,
"Man, I wish I could eat
just the cheese."
Since we're a family
of cheesemakers,
we look at it and think,
"Huh. How could we turn that
into a snack bar?"
So, let me show you
how we do it.
First, we start
with Wisconsin milk.
Make our own fresh cheese
in?house.
Shred just a little bit
into a cookie?cutter mold.
Pop it in the oven.
And that is it.
No rice, no fillers.
It's just the cheese.
Comes in two bars in a pack.
It's the perfect grab?and?go
snack for anytime, anywhere.
And because it's just the...
Cheese.
Cheese.                  Cheese.
...everyone will love it.
So, now for the best part ??
let's try 'em.
Let's try 'em.
Feel free to read
the ingredient list.
It's a quick read and short.
Different flavors?
Yep.
Aged Cheddar
is our top seller.
If you like stronger flavors,
I'd start there.
Grilled Cheese
is more mild.
Really good.
I have to admit,
I've had this before.
Really?!
Herjavec: What?
Yes.
I bought it on Amazon.
You are not alone
with that.
We sell between 400 and 700
boxes a day on Amazon.
It's <i>very</i> cheesy.
I can't believe
it's so simple.
How many calories
per bar?
Per bar? 75.
That's it?
That's it? Wow.
In the package
with two bars,
150 calories,
8 grams of protein.
It's sugar?free,
gluten?free.
Why can't anybody
knock you off?
I mean, you're doing
something so simple.
Anybody can do this,
right?
Theoretically, yes,
but there's a lot of science
that goes into cheesemaking,
and we have some extremely
talented people.
But this is everywhere.
No, but, David, David,
there's a ton of brands
out there ahead of you.
I think your brand is better.
I love Just The Cheese.
You're very direct.
But there's like three
or four big, gigantic
companies that have ??
Daniel, and they're
just cheese also?
Yeah.
So, there are
two big competitors,
both of whom have
private?equity overlords.
[ Chuckles ]
One competitor
also puts quinoa, brown rice,
and oat bran in it,
so it's cheaper and it tastes
more like a cracker.
For reference,
we're usually ranked
in, like, the mid?300s
on all of Amazon grocery.
They're ranked
in the 18,000 range.
Well, all that matters
is your sales.
Tell us about
your business.
Sure.
So, last year, we launched.
First year in existence,
we did $3.5 million in sales.
Hello.
Wow!
Year?to?date,
we are already at 3.7,
and we still have
four months of the year left.
And how many stores
are you in?
700 stores right now,
plus 1,300 from a prominent
convenience store chain,
7?Eleven.
I got my first P. O. s today.
What?
So, what, you did
$3.5 million year?to?date
out of only 700 stores?
And Amazon, so ??
Plus ??
Okay, break that down.
I will back up, 'cause I think
chronology will help.
I sort of keep
an eye on the family business.
So we had been tinkering around
after we saw Whisps,
so we talked to my dad about it
and said,
"Hey, we used to do something
similar back in the '90s
for the Atkins craze.
When the Atkins craze died,
the product cratered.
So we looked at
relaunching it,
and my wife had the foresight
to spot the keto trend.
And when keto took off,
we were pretty much
the only game in town.
So, did you raise
any investment?
Nope. This family has
self?funded this completely.
How much did you put in
to get to this point?
We've probably invested a total
of maybe a million dollars.
What does it cost you to make?
What do you wholesale it for?
So, at our current volume,
95 cents ??
And what do you
sell it for?
$1.27,
retailing for $1.99.
Depending on the SKU,
we make between 17% and 20%.
That's it?
When we wholesale it
to a brick?and?mortar store,
it's 25.
That's terrible margins.
What's the plan
to make more margin on it?
So, if I sell
40,000 boxes a month...
And what's the cost?
...at that volume...
it would be 75 cents per,
at $1.27.
So my margin increases
substantially as I grow.
If there was ever
a royalty deal, this is it.
Greiner: Royalty?
There's no way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's in stores
everywhere.
Excuse me, Lori.
He doesn't need that.
I'd like to make
an offer.
Thank you.
Okay.
[ Chuckles ]
Look, I don't have a cheese
provider in my portfolio.
[ Laughter ]
I have a lot of wine.
Wine, cheese ?? you kind of get
what I'm talking about here.
I'll give you
the $500,000,
and I want a 20 cent royalty
per bar, which is ??
He's got no margins.
You can't ??
Herjavec: [ Laughs ]
Silence
while I make an offer.
He can decide whether he wants
to take it or not.
Alright.
Make it already.
I don't need the noise from
the cheese factory back here.
I'm trying to.
[ Chuckles ]
I'll give you the $500,000
for a 20 cent royalty,
and I will give you tremendous
marketing leverage on this.
Because I think this could be
a fantastic business
if you can get
more distribution.
With all due respect,
I think that that piggybacks
off the hard work
we've already done.
But I can add
a lot of value here,
bringing this
into my portfolio
and making you
a "Shark Tank" company.
And our interests
are totally aligned.
I'm only asking
for a little cheese on my beak
every time we sell a bar.
[ Chuckles ]
Look, I think you've
done an amazing job
getting it out there.
I think you're probably
one of the fastest
zero?to?million?plus in sales
we've had on the show.
But I don't like
the taste of it.
It's not a knock on it.
It's just a personal thing
for me.
Yep.
So, you know,
only for that reason,
I'm out,
but I congratulate you
on the success.
I think
Kevin's offer smells.
I think
he cut the cheese.
[ Laughs ]
Ah!
I was waiting for someone
to go there.
Lubetzky:
David, here's my thoughts.
I think you have
a superior brand,
but farmers of cheese
are looking and shopping around
to see who would like them
to make this product,
so there's gonna be
more entrants.
I just don't think
there's space, and I'm out.
Okay.
So, I like your packaging
a lot.
I think it's really smart.
It's really good.
But I'm seeing
so many places,
ads for things
that are competitive,
and I'm not sure
who's going to wind up
being the leaders in this.
And for half a million dollars
at 5%,
I don't feel solid enough
to invest,
so I'm out.
Alright.
I'll give you another angle,
and this is what dawned on me.
At a $10 million valuation,
even if you sell the company
for $50 million
and I get
five times my money,
my total upside is
$2.5 million over $500,000.
That's not enough for the risk
that's involved.
I just don't see a way
to overcome that.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Yeah.
All is not lost,
because the Yellow Cheese Road
leads back
to Mr. Wonderful.
David has one offer on the table
for his cheese snack company,
Just The Cheese.
O'Leary:
David, to be clear,
I give you
half a million dollars,
I ask for 20 cents a bar
as a royalty,
I get no equity.
In perpetuity?
Absolutely. How else
am I gonna do this deal?
Perpetuity
is a very long time.
It's a word I like.
So, how flexible are you
in the royalty fee itself
and the term of the deal?
I'm not negotiating
against myself.
I'm trying to come up with
a reasonable deal on the fly.
I just gave you one.
David,
make a counter.
Here,
I'll help him.
I'll give you
half a million dollars
for <i>15</i> cents a bar.
I like David.
I really like David.
So, what's your counter,
then?
Well,
I'm looking at a nickel.
A nickel?
In perpetuity?
Nope ?? 10 years.
A nickel for 10 years?
Wait, how many bars
did you sell last year?
Yeah.
Last year on Amazon, I did
1.8 million individual packages.
Well, I'm sticking at 15 cents
until I recoup...
$750,000.
So, David. David,
I'll offer you $500,000.
I want 15%, no royalty.
Cuban:
So, back to me, David.
15% is high for me.
So I would ask
if you'd consider 7.5%.
No. 'Cause there's got to be
enough upside for me.
It needs to get to scale
And the difference
between 8% in equity,
if we get it to scale,
is bupkes.
[ Flaps lips ]
We wish you the best,
David.
O'Leary: Thank you, David.
?David, good luck.
?It was an interesting ride.
Greiner: Good luck, David.
It was a pleasure, guys.
Thank you so much.
