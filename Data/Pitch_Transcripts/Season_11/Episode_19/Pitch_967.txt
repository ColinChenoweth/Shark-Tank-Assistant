Hi.
My name is David Scharfman,
But this is everywhere.
No, but, David, David,
Lubetzky:
David, here's my thoughts.
David has one offer on the table
for his cheese snack company,
Just The Cheese.
O'Leary:
David, to be clear,
I give you
half a million dollars,
I ask for 20 cents a bar
as a royalty,
I get no equity.
In perpetuity?
Absolutely. How else
am I gonna do this deal?
Perpetuity
is a very long time.
It's a word I like.
So, how flexible are you
David,
make a counter.
Here,
I'll help him.
I'll give you
half a million dollars
for <i>15</i> cents a bar.
I like David.
I really like David.
So, what's your counter,
then?
Well,
I'm looking at a nickel.
A nickel?
In perpetuity?
Nope ?? 10 years.
A nickel for 10 years?
Wait, how many bars
did you sell last year?
Yeah.
Last year on Amazon, I did
1.8 million individual packages.
Well, I'm sticking at 15 cents
until I recoup...
$750,000.
So, David. David,
I'll offer you $500,000.
I want 15%, no royalty.
Cuban:
So, back to me, David.
15% is high for me.
So I would ask
if you'd consider 7.5%.
No. 'Cause there's got to be
enough upside for me.
It needs to get to scale
We wish you the best,
David.
O'Leary: Thank you, David.
?David, good luck.
?It was an interesting ride.
Greiner: Good luck, David.
It was a pleasure, guys.
Thank you so much.
