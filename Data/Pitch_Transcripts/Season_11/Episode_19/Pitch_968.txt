I also have here
Ryan Fitzpatrick,
quarterback
of the Miami Dolphins,
Hey, Sharks.
I'm Kent.
When I met Kent in college,
he was studying neuroscience
Where did you meet Ryan?
I met Kent
in Japanese class.
We automatically
just hit it off,
Ryan, I got to tell you, I am
so friggin' hyper right now.
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Let's go! I'm gonna
take you on in judo, Kent.
Deal, deal, deal!

So, listen, walk me through
your distribution,
because the danger
with rising sales
is that they may mask
repeat sales.
Daniel, there is
a big reason why we're here,
because retail
is terrifying.
