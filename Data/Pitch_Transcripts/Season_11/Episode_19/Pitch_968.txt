I also have here
Ryan Fitzpatrick,
quarterback
of the Miami Dolphins,
and huge fan
of the Tailgate N Go.
So, as part
of your license,
we're gonna have the rights
to all 32 team marks
and the ability to sell
nationwide and on our NFL Shop.
Higgins: To be an officially
licensed product, it means
that you could use team logos
on all your products.
It means that you use
the reach of the NFL
to put you in front of every
single NFL fan in the country.
And let's face it ?? there are
hundreds of millions of them.
It's a game?changer.
Everybody loves the game,
but it's the party
before the game
that is the big deal
for a lot of these fans,
and I think NFL fans
are gonna love it.
Dad, don't cry.
You're gonna make <i>me</i> cry.
Higgins:
The sky is the limit now.
We're gonna go after
other sports leagues.
We're going after
major retailers.
We are gonna be everywhere.
It's so amazing
that we've actually
reached our goal.
But we're not done yet. We have
one more surprise for you.
Higgins: We're launching
at the NFL Experience.
We're gonna put Tailgate N Go
on display,
and we are gonna sell
Tailgate N Gos.
It's a portable
modular outdoor kitchen.
?I love it.
?Yeah? You love it?
?I want to cook on this.
?I love it, too.
Taylor: We couldn't be
more thankful to "Shark Tank"
and Matt Higgins
for this experience.
We honestly feel like the
luckiest family in the world.
First sale, baby!
First sale!
[ Laughs ]
You're awesome.
Higgins: They were just given
the shot of a lifetime,
and I believe that they're gonna
make everything out of it,
'cause that's what they did
on "Shark Tank"
when they convinced me
to come back in,
and that's what they're gonna do
with the NFL.
What this family shows
is that if you work hard
and you never take "no"
for an answer,
you could literally do anything.
Together: "Shark Tank"!
Hey, Sharks.
I'm Kent.
And I'm Ryan.
When I met Kent in college,
he was studying neuroscience
And Ryan was
studying chemistry
and was captain of
the cross?country
and track team.
He's a second?degree
black belt in karate.
And he's finished
12 marathons.
He's also an artist
and has done over 40
murals around the world.
And he trains with
the U. S. Paralympic team.
I guess, if there's one word
to describe us, it would be...
More, more, more.
More, more, more.
[ Chuckles ]
Look, we like to push
each other,
but sometimes you just need
that little extra boost.
Coffee's great, but it doesn't
fit in your pocket,
and you don't want to be
running around with it.
Oh, and don't get me started
on energy drinks.
We wanted
clean, balanced energy ??
something that could be taken
anytime, anywhere.
So that's why we created
NeuroGum and NeuroMints ??
for when you need
just a little more.
Using a patented
cold?compressed method...
We use a blend of
natural caffeine...
...plus L?theanine...
...and B6 and B12 vitamins
in each piece.
Each piece contains
as much caffeine
as half a cup of coffee.
And since you absorb it
through your mouth,
it works way faster
than drinks or supplements.
But what about the sugar?
Oh, ew. No.
GMOs?
Nope.
Alright, but is it vegan?
Yeah, of course it is.
Wow. It really <i>is</i> better
than a cup of coffee.
And 1/10 the price.
So, Sharks, wake up.
Don't get yourself stuck
in a sticky situation.
Now, who wants to chew on
some NeuroGum and NeuroMints?
Yeah, bring it on.
We got some samples.
?Let's do it.
?Bring it on.
?Alright.
?There you go.
It's the mints on the top,
and cinnamon...
Oh, thank you.
...and mint?flavored gum
on the bottom.
What do you want us
to try first?
?Try the mints first.
?The mints are great.
?Oh, the mints?
?The sliding tin one.
Herjavec: How long does it
take to be effective?
5 to 10 minutes.
Lubetzky:
Are you already in stores?
Yoshimura: We <i>are</i> in stores ??
5,500 locations.
Tell us a little
about your background.
When I was in college,
I was basically training
four to five hours a day,
trying to balance school
with my social life,
and my training
was extremely difficult.
So I was mixing supplements
in my own room.
And, obviously, we have chemists
and formulators now
to refine it,
but that was essentially v zero
of NeuroGum.
Where did you meet Ryan?
I met Kent
in Japanese class.
We automatically
just hit it off,
and then we became
best friends.
And in 2009,
I was 19 years old,
and I got in a really bad
snowboarding accident.
Oh, no.
And doctors told me
I would never walk again.
I spent the next two years
and 15 surgeries
in the hospital.
I think that was definitely
the lowest point of my life.
And, fortunately,
I had the best friends,
family in the world
that helped me get back
to where I wanted to be.
You know, Kent and I
just wanted to live more.
We wanted to do everything
that life had to offer.
And that was really
the catalyst to start NeuroGum.
Herjavec: You know, life
can change in a millisecond.
Greiner: Yeah.
Kudos to you.
I mean,
that is just so impressive.
I'm just trying to live life
to the best.
Well, here you are
on "Shark Tank." That's not bad.
So,
based on your valuation,
you must be doing
a lot of business.
We can do much better,
but we have been doing
a fantastic job this year.
We're coming up
to about four years
from starting,
launching the company.
This year, we'll do about
$3.5 million in sales.
Wow!
And we just
entered retail ??
Greiner: 3?point what?
$3.5 million in sales
this year.
What did you do
last year?
Yeah, what was ??
About $1.5 million.
Bam!
[ Laughter ]
For the first 3 1/2 years
of the business,
we only focused on online
and Amazon.
So, about 33% of our customers
in the last 12 months
on our website
have bought again.
And on Amazon,
it's about 21%.
So the people who try
our product really love it.
Ryan, I got to tell you, I am
so friggin' hyper right now.
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
Let's go! I'm gonna
take you on in judo, Kent.
Deal, deal, deal!
[ Laughs ]
So, listen, walk me through
your distribution,
because the danger
with rising sales
is that they may mask
repeat sales.
Daniel, there is
a big reason why we're here,
because retail
is terrifying.
And I think we need
that marketing prowess,
the ad allowances,
the shelf talk ??
all those things that
kind of come into play.
Listing fees.
Like, it's crazy.
So, we're in 5,000
of the largest ??
the largest pharmacy chain
in the United States.
We're the number?2
best?selling product
in memory focus in CVS.
So, we retail the product
for about $3.95, $3.99,
and it costs us 67 cents to make
the NeuroGum and NeuroMints.
And so our gross margins
are high.
What is your sales
in just CVS?
It's close to half a million
so far.
I'm assuming you're
gonna tell me you're gonna
do $5 million next year?
I think we could do $10 million,
because we have...
Why?
...two large P. O. s
lined up
with two of the largest
airline companies.
Who are they?
It's Delta and JetBlue.
Lubetzky: So, guys,
some advice I want to give you,
because you can grow yourself
out of business
if you're not cautious here.
You can have an airline
get very excited,
try one order,
you go really fast,
and before you know it,
they don't reorder.
You just need to be careful
with your growth.
I love your authenticity.
You remind me of my father
because people
that survived the Holocaust,
the overwhelming majority,
they could not talk back
about their past.
My dad found a way to talk about
everything he went through,
but to always be kind,
to always be thankful,
and to always see the positive,
and I just see that in you.
But it's just not
a category
that I feel
I can connect to enough.
I'm out.
But I love everything
about you guys.
I wish you
the very, very best.
Thank you so much.
Daniel, we look up to you
a tremendous amount
at what you've done
with Kind Bar.
And you are, like,
an inspiration to us.
Okay, boys,
no more "Kumbaya."
$750,000 ?? what are you
doing with the money?
So, the $750,000
is gonna go into
the marketing efforts in retail,
because that's the ??
Marketing?
Guys, why are you even
talking about retail?
You have a proven model.
Why are you worth
$15 million?
Because most CPG companies right
now have been getting acquired
at 3x to 10x multiple
on top?line revenue,
and that's what
we're talking about.
But that doesn't have to do
with where you're at right now.
