Jacobs: Hi, Sharks.
My name
is Zac McDaniel.
This is my wife, Jana,
Jana: Designed to safely
repel insects,
First Saturday Lime
is insanely effective
without ever jeopardizing
the health of you, your babies,
or your furbabies.
Or feather?babies!
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Not only is our product
so safe,
it's so easy to apply.
Simply spread
First Saturday Lime
around the exterior
of your home
to create a strong
but safe barrier,
like Zara's doing
around the chicken coop.
You can also sprinkle
a light layer of our formula
on any plant, garden,
or surface.
We've built this business
from the ground up,
Oh, Jennings.
One more "buh?gock."

So, the premise is,
if I take powdered lime,
which is what this is ??
a commodity, right?
Is that all it is?
It's actually
a proprietary formula.
Zac: Citrus acid
is the active ingredient.
Yeah.
It acts as
an insect repellent
Jacobs: Well, it's
a once?a?month application.
Greiner: Oh.
So on the first Saturday
of every month ??
Repeat customers!
Is it all online,
Jana?
Right now, our split is
80% online, 20% retail.
This year, so far,
what are your actual sales?
This year, our actual sales
are $150,000.
But you said $350,000.
Those are projections?
Jana: Well,
we signed vendor agreements
with larger distributors,
but we really said,
"Okay, we need a strategic
partner to go after this."
What if a child puts it
in their mouth?
It's absolutely safe.
This is not to be eaten
by people, correct?
Right.
Thank you very much.
Correct.
I can order a bag
for $19.99.
It costs $1.60 to make.
Do you provide free shipping?
Do I pay for the shipping?
This thing weighs about
10 pounds.
Jana: We do provide
free shipping.
What does it cost
to ship it?
About $10.
Whoa!
So, we have ??
It's very heavy.
We are negotiating our rates
right now again,
based on ??
our volume is so large.
We can get those down.
So we are making it
even lower.
We believe
in this product.
We want to create a healthy
alternative for families
Jana, they're selling
pretty hard.
What do you think?
Let me just say ??
we came in asking for 10%,
Jana: Our dad would be
so proud of us.
