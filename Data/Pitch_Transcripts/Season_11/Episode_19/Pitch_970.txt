And we're the founders of Neuro,
from Los Angeles, California.
Today
we're seeking $750,000
in exchange for 5%
of the company.
?Whoo!
?Okay.
?Whoo!
?Whoo!
Jacobs: Hi, Sharks.
I'm Jessica Jacobs,
and this is Angel.
My name
is Zac McDaniel.
This is my wife, Jana,
our children,
Zara and Jennings.
We're from
Okarche, Oklahoma,
and we're seeking $100,000
for 10% equity in our company.
Sharks, we have
three kick?ass generations
of family farming
under our belt,
and now we're ready
to help save the planet.
? Dunh?dunh?dunh duh! ?
[ Laughter ]
As farmers,
there's one problem
we share with
the rest of the world.
Those pesky bugs getting
in our homes and our gardens.
Bugs are gross!
And you don't want them
in your house, do ya?
Most of the time,
people turn to pesticides
filled with
poisonous ingredients
that are harmful to children,
plants, and animals.
That's why we decided
to create...
All:
First Saturday Lime!
A completely eco?friendly
insect repellent.
Jana: Designed to safely
repel insects,
First Saturday Lime
is insanely effective
without ever jeopardizing
the health of you, your babies,
or your furbabies.
Or feather?babies!
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Not only is our product
so safe,
it's so easy to apply.
Simply spread
First Saturday Lime
around the exterior
of your home
to create a strong
but safe barrier,
like Zara's doing
around the chicken coop.
You can also sprinkle
a light layer of our formula
on any plant, garden,
or surface.
We've built this business
from the ground up,
and now the only thing
"bugging" us
is needing the funds
to put First Saturday Lime
in the hands of families
around the world.
So, Sharks,
who wants to join us
and say goodbye
to nasty bugs
and hello to protecting
your family, plants,
and animals?
[ Clucks ]
[ Laughter ]
?So, we can touch it and all ??
?Yes.
?Yes.
?Yes. Absolutely safe.
Here you go, buddy.
Thank y'all so much.
Wait. We want
one more chicken imitation.
Herjavec: Thank you, guys.
Great job.
Oh, Jennings.
One more "buh?gock."
[ Clucks ]
[ Laughter ]
So, the premise is,
if I take powdered lime,
which is what this is ??
a commodity, right?
Is that all it is?
It's actually
a proprietary formula.
I read what it is,
and it's ??
O'Leary: Why don't you just
tell us what it is?
Well, what's the secret,
if Lori knows?
I don't know if we want
to blow anything.
It's citric acid, correct?
It's on the label. What do you
mean, "blow anything"?
[ Chuckles ]
Zac: Citrus acid
is the active ingredient.
Yeah.
It acts as
an insect repellent
and an antimicrobial
for odor?causing bacteria
and algae.
?So, citric acid with lime?
?But it's so incredibly safe.
Mm?hmm.
So, I would have
no fear whatsoever
to sprinkle
this anywhere?
Right.
What's with the name
"First Saturday Lime"?
Jacobs: Well, it's
a once?a?month application.
Greiner: Oh.
So on the first Saturday
of every month ??
Repeat customers!
...we go online
and we remind customers,
"Hey, this is a perfect time
to re?lime,"
and then they can share
their stories and results
with people.
That's cool.
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.
We are a third generation
in the limestone industry.
Our father
had the idea for it.
He's no longer with us,
but he was working
with universities
and various co?ops,
and he started
this formula.
And then he passed
nine years ago,
and Jana and Zac,
they took over the farm,
they grew the company,
and they also made it
sustainable.
We built a factory,
and we have just exploded.
Farmers in America ??
do they know
that citric acid is
a common insect repellent?
Is that widely used?
So, lime is
fairly common,
but what we did was
we created a version of it
which acts
as this magic formula.
Do you have a patent?
There's patent pending utility
on our factory.
So, we built a factory ??
On the factory,
not the product?
So, it's the secret process
on how to utilize the lime
so that it works
in this manner?
Yes.
And how much
does each bag cost?
The 20?pound bag
is $19.99.
What's it cost you
to make?
$1.60.
?Wow.
?There you go!
?Whoa!
?Yeah, there you go.
?I have a question, too.
?Great margin.
You got my citric acids
flowing
when you talked about
those margins,
and I want to keep talking
about the business.
Ew!
What are you going to be doing
in annual sales this year
at that margin?
This year, we're scheduled
to do $350,000.
Good for you.
And next year, based on
our current run rates ??
so, last month's sales ??
we should do $600,000.
So, you did $50,000
last month, basically.
Yes, but ??
You're basically
selling these bags online?
Is it all online,
Jana?
Right now, our split is
80% online, 20% retail.
This year, so far,
what are your actual sales?
This year, our actual sales
are $150,000.
But you said $350,000.
Those are projections?
Yes,
and that's based on ??
our last two months' rates
are $50,000.
O'Leary: It's not a lot.
Are you having a hard time
explaining the benefits
of this product?
No, it's great.
Are you kidding me?
?It's <i>not</i> great.
?It's nothing.
Jana: Well,
we signed vendor agreements
with larger distributors,
but we really said,
"Okay, we need a strategic
partner to go after this."
What if a child puts it
in their mouth?
It's absolutely safe.
This is not to be eaten
by people, correct?
Right.
Thank you very much.
Correct.
I can order a bag
for $19.99.
It costs $1.60 to make.
Do you provide free shipping?
Do I pay for the shipping?
This thing weighs about
10 pounds.
Jana: We do provide
free shipping.
What does it cost
to ship it?
About $10.
Whoa!
So, we have ??
It's very heavy.
We are negotiating our rates
right now again,
based on ??
our volume is so large.
We can get those down.
So we are making it
even lower.
We believe
in this product.
We want to create a healthy
alternative for families
and their homes
and gardens
so that they can
keep the bugs out.
I think you guys are coming
from a genuine place,
but I think you don't know what
you don't know at this point,
and it's gonna be
an uphill battle.
I'm out.
Thank you so much
for your time, Robert.
Okay, so,
the amount of education
that's gonna be required
to scale this
to make it a big business
is a formidable amount of work
because you've got
to explain
why a frog and a Saturday
and a lime
have anything to do
with each other.
That's just not a journey
I want to go on.
I wish you the best of luck.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Mark, I know this isn't
necessarily right up your alley,
but I also know that
you're interested in
what we're saying here.
See, look, guys,
presentation was great.
You made it clear
that the product is good.
The challenge is,
I just don't know
the lawn and garden business.
I just don't have anything
significant
where I can say
"Here's the accelerant.
Let's just go."
So, I think
it's a phenomenal business,
but I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
I appreciate it.
Congratulations.
Greiner: Okay.
The fantastic thing
about this product
is that it is safe.
So I'm very interested.
And it's so easy
to apply.
I know the hardware space
very well.
I think
this could be a hit,
but I think you need
to change the packaging.
And I need the message
to be more clear.
I'm gonna make you a bit
of a Sharky offer, though.
in Zac, Jana, and Jessica's
eco?friendly insect repellent,
First Saturday Lime.
I'm gonna make you a bit
of a Sharky offer, though.
Because I love the product
from the get?go.
But you need a lot of help.
Is there an offer
in the future?
So, my offer is
I'm gonna give you
the $100,000,
but I need to be
a third partner.
Well, thank you so much
for that offer.
We are very grateful.
And I think we can work together
to meet in the middle.
So...
[ Laughter ]
Oh!
Lubetzky: Guys,
these are my thoughts.
I think I am out,
unless Lori wants
to do this together,
in which case, I would consider
helping add value
with certain channels,
with certain marketing issues,
with certain
promotional issues.
Listen, I like Daniel.
I think that he also
would be helpful
in a new product
getting out there.
So I'm happy
to have Daniel in with me.
So, then,
that's two Sharks,
but we're gonna be
a third partner.
Well, based on what we have
our counts already,
we foresee a large profit
next year
of at least $200,000.
So would you do 20%
with the two of you?
Alright, here.
I want you to look me
very closely in the eyes, okay?
[ Laughs ]
Look at me.
You looking at me?
"Look me in the eye."
?Yes.
?Okay.
You say you're going to do
$200,000 next year profit?
Yes.
Why don't you change that
and add several zeroes?
Right?
We could do
at least $2 million.
So, you've got to think about,
what do you want to do?
You're going to sell
so much more.
And you don't
even have any idea
of all the things
you're gonna face,
so it's just gonna be
a road
that's gonna require
a lot of engagement,
so I really, personally can't
take any less than what ??
Jana, they're selling
pretty hard.
What do you think?
Let me just say ??
we came in asking for 10%,
and you went to 33%,
and then you talked about
how much money we could make.
So we're hoping
we might be able to meet you
just a little bit more in
the middle there, based on that.
What if we did the $100,000,
the 33.3%,
but we will help to fund
your purchase orders?
So you won't have
to worry about that.
Are you good with that?
I agree with that.
Bankrolling purchase orders.
It can be a lot more money
than you were thinking ??
and more than
<i>I</i> was thinking.
It's the same pig
with different lipstick.
But we're happy
to do that.
You're still giving up 1/3.
Well, but it's not easy.
Yeah, but they don't need to
dilute themselves every time.
Right. Or go beg for a bank
to fund you ??
You're still giving up
1/3.
If you would do it
for 25%,
I think
we could make it work.
25%.
You want to do it?
Jana: Our dad would be
so proud of us.
And we can make Mr. Wonderful
a lot of money.
Yeah, and make the world
a better place, honestly.
Yes.
Yes. Yes.
Honestly.
That's what we're gonna do.
