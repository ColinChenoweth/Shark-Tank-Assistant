Hey, Sharks.
I'm Shannon.
And I'm Sarah, and we're
from Evanston, Illinois,
seeking $90,000 for 15% equity
in our company...
Seriously Slime!
Seriously Slime!
Sharks, I know what
you're thinking ??
"Seriously? Slime?"
[ Chuckles ]
That's right, Sharks.
We <i>are</i> serious about slime.
And you should be, too.
If you have children between
the ages of 4 and 12 years old,
chances are,
they've asked you to make slime,
buy slime,
play with slime,
or they've watched the endless
videos online about slime.
Slime is everywhere!
And it's not going anywhere.
But let's face the facts ??
slime is messy.
It's messy to make,
requires a lot of ingredients,
and when things
don't go well,
kids tend to go
a little cray.
And that is why we created
Seriously Slime,
where our motto is...
"Let them make slime!"
"Let them make slime!"
At Seriously Slime, kids get to
experiment with slime
in a fun
and play?driven environment
where there are no looming
concerns over that mess.
Now, Robert, we understand
you have a birthday coming up.
Whoo?hoo!
And we heard
you wanted to celebrate
with Seriously Slime.
Thank you.
We're honored.
We are hoping
you would come up
and make a personalized slime
at our mobile Slime Shop.
?Yes!
?Yes!
?[ Chuckles ]
?Thank you.
Herjavec: Hello, girls!
Mobile Slime Shop.
Bam. Bam.
Alright!
Valko:
This is gonna be fun.
Making slime
is a three?step process.
And the first step is
to make the slime itself.
You're gonna stir this.
Can I have you stir that?
Yes, you may.
Like a chef.
You're just gonna stir until
all the ingredients are mixed.
[ Chuckles ]
For the next part,
you're gonna pick it up
and knead it like bread.
Oh.
How do I knead it?
You can pull and fold
and pull and fold.
And you're gonna do this
just for a minute or so.
And we have another slime
ready for you
if you want
to start personalizing.
Alright.
?Do you want any glitter?
?Do I want glitter?
Of course!
?[ Laughs ]
?Oh, wow!
McDermott: We do have products
we sell in the stores.
Look at the color!
?Are you okay with this?
?Beautiful.
Finally, Robert,
the truth comes out.
Robert,
you're a slimeball.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: Aww!
That was awesome, girls.
Thank you.
Valko: Thanks, guys.
Love you guys.
Bye?bye!
O'Leary: There's a lot of slime
on the market, right?
?Can I smell yours?
?There's tons of slime.
So, at Seriously Slime,
our model is
that we actually started
by doing mobile parties,
partnering with businesses,
and then opened our ??
But your model
is to actually have events.
?Yes.
?It's a party...
?Correct.
?...they make slime.
We are
an experiential company.
So, that's
a service business,
and it's within
a geographic region, right?
So, we are in Chicago ??
Evanston, Illinois ?? right now.
Our goal is to license
Seriously Slime.
Have you licensed
any yet?
We have not yet,
because we are so new.
We started seven months ago
with an idea.
Nothing wrong with that,
but, I mean,
to turn that into a licensed,
leveraged play requires a brand,
because people
that are gonna basically
license or franchise
from you
are looking for
national marketing support,
so they acquire parties
in their region.
Well, they're obviously not
there yet. Where are you now?
So, right now, we've been doing
mobile birthday parties
for the last seven months,
and two months ago,
we opened up our own
Seriously Slime shop.
We have gone through all
the paperwork to be a license,
and we've gotten
a ton of requests.
So, let's just look
at the events business.
How many events have you done,
what do you charge per event,
and how much revenue
have you generated?
Sure.
Well, since we started,
we've generated
$28,000 in revenue.
$23,000 of that has been
in the last two months
since we opened up our shop,
but that's only because
our capacity to have more events
has increased.
Before we opened our shop,
we had $5,000 in revenue.
What do you charge
per party?
$300 to $350
for an hour.
?$350?
?How many kids?
Does that include
the product?
Yes.
That includes everything.
How do you take that
and make it a bigger business?
Just last year,
there were 25 billion views
of slime videos.
That's a different animal,
though.
That is the interest level
of this activity.
It's fair enough
to say that,
but now you're talking
to investors.
So, you want me to give you
$90,000 for 15%.
Nobody is going to franchise
or license from you,
because you haven't made
any money yet.
But, Shannon, you're not
answering the question.
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
The demand is there,
but the challenge is,
other people can create
these businesses.
McDermott:
Can my fifth?grade niece
start a slime company?
100%, and she can do
a few family parties,
and it's sweet.
If someone wants to create
a business around this,
you work with us.
We'll give you
lead generation.
How are you gonna do that?
You're not a brand yet.
Valko: That's why we need the
investment, so that we can begin
our marketing campaign
to go out in the communities
and start recruiting
these licensees.
So, the question becomes,
"Can you make money
from just a shop?"
Yes.
We started with $500.
Yes.
We haven't invested anything
in this, outside of $500.
Good for you.
Good for you.
That's awesome.
?And it's just the two of you?
?And it's just the two of us.
Let me give you
an idea here.
Look, the place
that wants kids to come ??
with their parents,
in particular ?? are malls.
Malls need a reason
to attract traffic.
So true.
And if you can
bring parents in,
if you can just let the kids
there while the parents shop...
Yep.
Mm?hmm.
...they'll give you
the space for free.
Yep.
We already have plans
to open one in a mall.
But you don't want
to start licensing it
to a bunch of other people,
because your obligations to them
will overwhelm everything else
that you're doing, right?
Yeah.
You've got to take
one step at a time.
It's not for me, specifically,
so I'm out,
but I think
it's a great opportunity.
Thank you, Mark.
Shannon, it was super fun.
I could see the parents
doing it with their kids.
But it takes time
to build that brand.
You know, you build it out,
you prove the model.
I think if you can get more
retail locations, it can work.
But, you know, money
doesn't grow a business.
Right.
Money is the accelerator
to a great plan.
Yeah.
I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you, Robert.
Listen, you don't always have
to do millions of dollars.
You can have
a nice, solid, good business
that brings the two of you
a great income.
And it makes you happy
and it makes others happy.
This could be
a great business.
And it just could be that.
But I don't think
it's investable for me,
and so I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Completely not something we're
pitching as a separate business,
but we've also made these
cute little Slime Babies,
which are...
Super cute.
...storage containers
for slime.
And we just made them
because we wanted the kids
to have something
to keep their slime in...
Super cute.
...because they put it in
plastic bags or containers.
They love it. They want
to bring it with them.
They love it.
They love it.
They want to take it
to school.
Shannon and Sarah,
I think the best thing
you have going is this,
and let me explain why.
In our household, we do not
allow slime anymore...
[ Laughs ]
...'cause so many carpets,
so many pieces of furniture
have been destroyed,
and you cannot
wash that stuff out.
Be the guys
that sell the pickets
to the people that are doing
the gold rush.
All the slime
all over the world,
sell them
the slime containers
so that the slime doesn't go
in the wrong places.
That's a great idea. You could
sell it online on Amazon.
That'd be a great
little business.
These might actually be
a stronger business
than any of the other things
you have.
Slime containers ??
that's a great idea.
And there's a need that you're
solving for, which is...
Yeah, absolutely.
But I'm sorry ?? I'm out.
But, guys, thank you
for your passion.
Thank you.
And maybe
we'll visit you in Illinois
one of these days
with our kids.
?Good luck, slimeballs.
?We love you all.
Thank you.
Bye, guys.
?Love you, too, you guys.
?Thank you.
?Take care.
?Congrats.
We're gonna continue to bring
the joy of slime to kids,
and the joy
that it brings to parents
to get it out of the house ??
one slime at a time.
