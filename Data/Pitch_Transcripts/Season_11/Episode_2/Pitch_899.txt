but the problem was my coworkers
would tease me endlessly
because of the design of it.
It was this big
white fluorescent lamp
that took a lot of space
on my desk.
It made me look like
the crazy person in the office.
[ Laughs ]
I get it.
So, there was the gap
in the marketplace
for a light?therapy lamp
that is effective,
but at the same time stylish.
You're putting a real valuation
on the table, right?
Yes.
You're saying, "My company's
worth $7.5 million,"
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Rob Neuner.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Mike Grice.
I'm the Chief Operating Officer
of Boost Oxygen.
Oxygen is the most
essential element
Neuner:
We are profitable.
Grice: Yes.
In 2018,
we had $705,000 in net income.
Oza: So, the problem
at the moment is,
the impulse purchase means
I'm on the mountain,
I feel like I need oxygen
or I'm out of breath,
I'm gonna impulse?buy.
That's a decent market.
on a problem they don't
really know they have.
'cause you'll probably try
to overbid me.
But here's the skinny ??
I'd much rather
have that beach house
for the million dollars,
so I'm out.
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Even when I love people,
I don't always feel like
it's the right deal for me.
Love you.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
Guys, it's rare
that we have a company come on
that has
95% market share.
Just doesn't happen,
so congratulations.
But in looking at
the five of us,
Neuner: It's more of
a buy?in, though.
Wasn't really ??
We don't need the cash.
We need someone
just to buy in ??
Hey, guys,
no Shark up here
is gonna give you
a million bucks for 5%
because they never
get their money back
until there's an exit.
We don't know
when that's gonna happen.
You're allowed
to counter.
Greiner: Yeah.
Oza:
Or he'll pull it.
Okay.
What do you think?
I think
it's a very valid point.
Right.
So, uh, so we'll do
$1 million...
Yeah.
...uh, for, uh,
6% of the, uh ??
not 6% ??
6% is the, um ??
sorry, the, uh,
interest rate, yeah.
6%.
The deal now
is you're countering me,
instead of giving me
9% interest,
you want to give me 6%.
Yes.
I keep my 7 1/2%,
right?
5%. For 5%.
5%.
All right,
because we're all reasonable,
we meet
in the middle.
[ Laughs ]
Okay. Split the baby.
That's how
we get this deal done.
So, I'm at 9%, you're at 6%.
Yeah.
7 1/2% interest,
no problem.
Grice: Quite honestly,
I was very surprised
But the problem for me
is that your numbers seem
really impractical.
They're not tangible.
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you.
O'Leary:
But it's not all bad news.
You have an offer
from Mark Cuban.
Maybe he's going to
bring in Rohan.
Contingent on the orders.
All right,
let's hear what they got.
He's replacing my offer,
which he obviously
didn't like.
We're probably gonna end up
being sitting right there,
right next to them
pretty soon.
Yeah.
If somebody offers you
$1 million,
you know you have
