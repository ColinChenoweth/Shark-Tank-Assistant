but the problem was my coworkers
would tease me endlessly
because of the design of it.
It was this big
white fluorescent lamp
that took a lot of space
on my desk.
It made me look like
the crazy person in the office.
[ Laughs ]
I get it.
So, there was the gap
in the marketplace
for a light?therapy lamp
that is effective,
but at the same time stylish.
You're putting a real valuation
on the table, right?
Yes.
You're saying, "My company's
worth $7.5 million,"
and therefore,
you must have blockbuster sales.
I do.
My lifetime sales
is $7.4 million.
Good for you.
Oh, I hate
lifetime sales, though.
What about
the last 12 months?
Can you give me
annual sales, please?
Last year,
I sold $4 million.
Wow.
Wow.
That's fantastic.
Thank you!
Are all of
your sales online?
All of our sales
are online.
What is
your average sale online?
Average sale is $57.99.
I look at this and say
we could probably help you
double your sales
very, very quickly
and probably
help you a lot
in your manufacturing
because I have
a lot of products.
We'll give
an extra $50,000
for your parents,
who are unbelievable people.
They would cry!
It's the same offer.
I don't know about
the parental thing.
Is that coming out of
the $750,000 they're giving you,
or are you giving them
an extra $50,000?
We'll give them
an extra $50,000.
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Rob Neuner.
I'm the CEO and founder
of Boost Oxygen.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Mike Grice.
I'm the Chief Operating Officer
of Boost Oxygen.
Oxygen is the most
essential element
for the heart, for the brain,
and for the muscles to function.
And we've all seen supplemental
oxygen being utilized
by professional football players
on the sidelines,
by aviators,
by mountaineers,
and by many other people
for many different purposes.
Boost Oxygen is 95%
pure aviator's breathing oxygen
compressed into affordable
and portable aluminum canisters.
It's an all?natural product
for health and wellness,
but it's not
a medical device.
Our mission at Boost Oxygen
is to make compressed oxygen
as available
as bottled water.
And, Kevin, if we sucked all
the oxygen out of this room,
we'd all be literally
dead to you right now.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
So, sometimes
you want more.
We believe that
by partnering with one of you,
we'll be able to reach
millions of people
who want to improve
their quality of life
and their performance.
So,
what we're gonna do,
we're all gonna try the oxygen
at the same time.
So,
you take the mask,
you put it under the nose
and over the mouth,
and you press
the trigger.
Right over the top.
Inhale it
for a couple of seconds.
We're gonna all do it
at the same time.
So, you ready?
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.
[ Canisters hissing ]
[ Chuckles ]
So,
what we're asking for
is a $1 million
capital investment ??
[ Coughs loudly ]
[ Laughs ]
...for a 5% equity stake
in Boost Oxygen.
Oh! Okay.
Greiner:
Wait. Repeat that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm out.
[ Canister hisses ]
What are your sales?
This year will be
$6.4 million.
Ooh.
Greiner: Whoa.
Oh, my God.
And are you profitable?
Neuner:
We are profitable.
Grice: Yes.
In 2018,
we had $705,000 in net income.
And how much will you make
this year, you think?
This year, we're gonna make
about $1.5 million.
Okay. Really?
Who's using this?
It really started at
altitude 'cause it's
an intuitive product.
When you go up
from Florida to Vail
and you go skiing
and you're breathing hard,
you see oxygen, you're like,
"I'm gonna try that."
And you try it, and you like it.
You use it when you're there.
When you
go back to Florida
and you're breathing hard,
you're exercising,
any time
that you're breathing hard,
it's your body telling you
you need more oxygen.
Cuban: Okay,
so, talk about competition,
'cause I know the Mavs use
a different type of canister
than this.
Yeah.
We do have competitors,
but what we're trying to do
is we're trying to
create a new space, a new
market, a new vertical,
'cause there is no
oxygen vertical right now.
Yeah, very nice to hear,
but where do you rank
with your competitors?
We have roughly 95% market share
in the United States.
Whoa!
[ Canister hissing ]
So, what's the cost of this
to the consumer?
$14.99, $9.99, $7.99.
$14.99, $9.99, $7.99.
For the 2?liter.
The cost is $2.05
to manufacture and aggregate
for all of
our different SKUs.
All of it?
How many hits do you get?
200 inhalations.
Is this FDA?approved?
It's not FDA ??
It's not a drug.
We're not regulated
by the FDA.
Oza: Someone here gives you
a million bucks, great.
Yes.
Now what are you gonna do
with that?
First thing we're going to do
is we need to expand our staff.
We would like to have greater
control over our sales force.
Right now,
we work with brokers,
we work with distributors,
we work with retailers.
O'Leary:
This is all retail?
Yeah.
You really want
to go to retail?
Yes.
Why not just stay the course
online and ??
Sure.
'Cause what I'm worried about
is there'll be a lot of
delistings
in stores that don't turn
this stuff.
It's an impulse purchase.
Oza: So, the problem
at the moment is,
the impulse purchase means
I'm on the mountain,
I feel like I need oxygen
or I'm out of breath,
I'm gonna impulse?buy.
That's a decent market.
The <i>great</i> market are brands you
have to use on a routine basis.
Right.
Uh?huh.
My concern is,
you're trying to educate people
on a problem they don't
really know they have.
And, so, unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.
Okay. Thanks.
Okay.
Yeah, appreciate it.
Sure.
Corcoran: I had an experience
with your particular brand
when I was in Utah
with my husband, Bill,
who has breathing issues.
I wholeheartedly agree with you
that you need to do retail
because I don't think
people take the time to think,
"Let me order a supply online."
But, as you've already learned,
it's a very expensive
proposition.
More importantly,
I saw a beach house last week
that was exactly $1 million,
and it was beautiful.
[ Chuckles ]
Uh?huh.
What beach?
Oh, it was cheap,
and I'm not telling you,
'cause you'll probably try
to overbid me.
But here's the skinny ??
I'd much rather
have that beach house
for the million dollars,
so I'm out.
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Even when I love people,
I don't always feel like
it's the right deal for me.
Love you.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
Guys, it's rare
that we have a company come on
that has
95% market share.
Just doesn't happen,
so congratulations.
But in looking at
the five of us,
none of us took it and said,
"Wow, this is a no?brainer."
We all had to, like,
"Oh, wait, do I feel anything?"
That's not good.
Normally, I can come up
with an angle for anything
to get it on
a ubiquitous path.
I just ??
I don't see it.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Neuner: It's more of
a buy?in, though.
Wasn't really ??
We don't need the cash.
We need someone
just to buy in ??
Hey, guys,
no Shark up here
is gonna give you
a million bucks for 5%
because they never
get their money back
until there's an exit.
We don't know
when that's gonna happen.
You're allowed
to counter.
Greiner: Yeah.
Oza:
Or he'll pull it.
Okay.
What do you think?
I think
it's a very valid point.
Right.
So, uh, so we'll do
$1 million...
Yeah.
...uh, for, uh,
6% of the, uh ??
not 6% ??
6% is the, um ??
sorry, the, uh,
interest rate, yeah.
6%.
The deal now
is you're countering me,
instead of giving me
9% interest,
you want to give me 6%.
Yes.
I keep my 7 1/2%,
right?
5%. For 5%.
5%.
All right,
because we're all reasonable,
we meet
in the middle.
[ Laughs ]
Okay. Split the baby.
That's how
we get this deal done.
So, I'm at 9%, you're at 6%.
Yeah.
7 1/2% interest,
no problem.
Cuban: Above 10%.
And 6% equity.
6 1/4%.
I'm pretty sharp
on the numberonis, there,
when we're cutting it
in half.
[ Laughs ]
I think the deal's reasonable.
Let's go.
Good?
Grice: Quite honestly,
I was very surprised
to be shaking hands
with Mr. Wonderful
talking about
a million?dollar deal,
and the input
that we received
from the entire
Tank of Sharks,
it's gonna do nothing
but take us
from good to great.
from the antibiotic problem
and the steroids.
But the problem for me
is that your numbers seem
really impractical.
They're not tangible.
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you.
O'Leary:
But it's not all bad news.
You have an offer
from Mark Cuban.
Maybe he's going to
bring in Rohan.
Contingent on the orders.
All right,
let's hear what they got.
He's replacing my offer,
which he obviously
didn't like.
Oza:
Mark and I ??
I'm back in
'cause Mark sucked me back in.
But here's
what we're thinking.
You need more money,
so we would be willing
to give you guys $1 million.
We're probably gonna end up
being sitting right there,
right next to them
pretty soon.
Yeah.
If somebody offers you
$1 million,
you know you have
something really extraordinary
in your hands.
Stand by
what you believe.
There was so much confusion
in that presentation.
Even when you offered her
the million dollars,
she didn't understand it.
Cuban: Yeah, and that's ??
Look, not everybody's
gonna understand
everything about business.
But you have to be honest
with yourself
and be self?aware
about what you don't know.
