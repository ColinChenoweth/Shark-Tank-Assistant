Hi.
I'm Deborah Torres.
And I'm Jonathan Torres.
We're from
San Jose, California,
seeking $500,000
for 10% of our company...
Atlas Monroe! Atlas Monroe!
Let's cut right
to the chase, Sharks.
We make the best,
most enticing,
extra?crispy
fried chicken
you've ever
put in your mouths.
But don't take
our words for it, Sharks.
Try it for yourselves
and dig in.
?Okay.
?Okay.
?Okay.
We don't mind.
Oza:
Fried chicken?
I love me
some fried chicken.
[ Chicken crunching ]
It's good.
Mm?hmm.
Some of the best fried chicken
you ever had, huh, Sharks?
Very close.
What if we told you
that fried chicken
wasn't chicken at all?
Oh, no [bleep]
Wow.
You heard that right,
Sharks.
We make nothing but 100% vegan,
plant?based eats
using only organic,
non?GMO ingredients,
all while satisfying
your every taste bud.
We started this incredible
company from the ground up.
And now our chicken
is an overnight sensation.
But, Sharks,
we need your help
to get our chicken
to food lovers everywhere.
Who wants to cash in
on our chicken?
[ Chuckles ]
The batter
is extremely tasty.
It's got some zip to it.
Thank you.
Thank you!
You really fooled me.
Oza:
Okay, guys.
What are you putting
in the stuff we're eating?
Right now,
our recipe is proprietary.
However, the base of it
is organic wheat.
Organic wheat?
Greiner: Really?
Yes.
So it's not soy?
Not at all.
No.
Now, did you invent all this,
or are you just packaging it all
from other places?
Oh, no, this is 100%
our original recipe.
Everything?
Batter, product, everything?
Everything.
Batter and everything.
We actually
both are the ones
that cook everything
from start to finish.
What's the story?
Well,
a few years ago,
my father was diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes.
My whole family and I
went on
a raw, vegan, and organic diet
for 90 days.
We grew really hangry
at each other...
Very.
...from eating just salads
and fruit salads.
Yep.
We started going to work in
the kitchen and experimenting,
making deliciousness
like raw lasagna and tacos,
and after the 90 days,
he was completely healed.
Wow.
We vowed to stay organic,
plant?based, and natural.
We continued
to experiment,
and Atlas Monroe
was born.
You manufacture this,
or you have a commercial kitchen
that does it for you,
I assume, by now.
Mm?hmm.
And your distribution strategy
is what?
So, what we started off first
was with festivals.
We would always have
two?hour waits,
people were just
so intrigued by our chicken.
So we started
shipping nationwide.
And were you shipping
frozen product?
And how much revenue
are you doing?
Oza:
Oh, sorry, Barbara.
We're shipping frozen,
yeah.
What are
your total sales?
And break it down
by category.
Well, let me tell you guys
something first.
It's never good when
you don't give us the
number. You know that?
Oh, I'm gonna give you
the numbers.
Let me tell you.
Let me tell you.
[ Laughter ]
We have celebrities,
we have influencers
who vouch for us,
telling the world
that it's the best
that they've ever had
without us ever
paying anyone a dime.
We were the first
and only vegan company
to be invited to the National
Fried Chicken Festival.
That's cool.
Yes.
That <i>is</i> cool.
We were named
Best Fried Chicken.
Out of
all the <i>real</i> chickens?
Yes!
Really?
Of all
the real chickens.
By <i>Time</i> magazine's
"Extra Crispy."
Wow.
From there,
within 24 hours,
we made $12,000 just from
a single Instagram post.
Wow.
We have over 20
wholesale customers
itching to get their hands
on our product...
Well,
it's very exciting...
...comprised of restaurants,
but ??
...but it's translated into what
in sales?
Oza: Drum roll, please.
And the numbers are...
Let me tell you.
Let me tell you.
I have the best ??
?What is the revenue?
The revenue is $60,000
that we've done this year.
Okay.
Our net is $73,000,
and our gross
is $76,000.
Wait, wait,
that doesn't add up.
That's confusion.
I think
you got it backwards.
Your total sales are...
No, our total sales
are $60,000.
A lot of our cost
goes into the shipping.
That's why our sales
are $60,000.
Our net,
with shipping and everything,
is $73,000,
and then our gross
is $76,000.
I don't want to stick a pin
in the balloon here, but...
But your numbers
are backwards.
You can't have $60,000 in sales
and make $73,000.
That's impossible.
Including the shipping ??
They're talking about
product revenue
and then shipping revenue.
Yes. Yes.
You've got to include shipping
because you can't go ??
I'm so confused.
I'm so confused.
Without the shipping ??
Product sales, $60,000.
Yes.
Including shipping revenue,
$73,000.
Yes.
What's your profit
or your loss?
We've made $45,000,
and our expenses is $31,000.
So, we're at
60% profit margin.
When you send out
a typical shipment,
what do you charge
for the chicken,
and what do you pay
for the shipping?
We charge $23
for a six?piece.
Our average shipping cost
is $21.
Are you charging $44
to the customer?
Yes.
So, now, for the six wings
and any packaging,
what does
it cost you?
It costs us $2.67.
What?!
Per wing
or for six wings?
For six.
For six.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Six of these giant piece
of fried chicken
cost you $2.60?
And 67 cents.
Oh, my God!
[ Chuckles ]
But asking for $500,000 for 10%
is ludicrous.
A little bit crazy,
yeah.
It's ridiculous.
O'Leary: And so
that would make ??
But the thing is ??
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me finish.
That's the decision
<i>you</i> made, okay?
That's not <i>my</i> decision.
You're not that clear
on your numbers.
Just being honest with you.
But the thing ??
You're not worth $500,000.
I'd have to have
120% of the company.
There's no way to get to
where we need to go with you.
I'm out.
Okay, so...
Thank you.
Deborah, have you tried
to get a co?packer yet?
We've been hesitant
because it's the only one
of its kind right now.
You don't want to reveal
your secret recipe.
Exactly.
However ?? Exactly.
Speaking of that,
we are currently in talks
with a mega?famous,
internationally known
fast?food restaurant chain
that is very interested
in our chicken.
Really?
So they have said
that they would take this?
They actually have our chicken
right now.
Right now.
Are you gonna give them
the recipe?
No.
No.
Okay.
I do want
to tell you guys ??
Before you speak, because I've
been listening very carefully,
I think you're here
way too early.
But what bothers me
is you're confused.
If you were
to come in here
and you had orders
or some proof...
We actually
do have those orders.
We just can't meet the
demand with the space and
the storage that we have.
No, you have the compliments
and the intent,
but you don't
have orders.
No, we have orders.
We have the orders.
We have the orders.
We just
tell them, like, "Okay"...
You lack the logistics
to even...
..."you need to wait for
them to be fulfilled right now
because
we're in the process
of fulfilling other orders
currently right now."
Well, I admire
where your heart is,
but for me,
it's just all too confusing.
And you know what?
It's a ridiculous number
you're asking.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna make you an offer,
but there's gonna be
so many contingencies.
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
Look, I went vegetarian
three months ago,
so this
is important to me,
and I love products
that I can eat.
You're obviously smart.
But you're learning to become
businesspeople as you go.
Every business that goes through
that hyper growth ??
and I've been there ??
if you're not organized
at the bottom,
when you start to grow,
it collapses.
So, I'm gonna give you
the $500K
as a letter of credit,
which means we'll draw down
on it as we grow,
and I want
30% of the business.
for Deborah and Jonathan's
plant?based fried?chicken
company, Atlas Monroe.
What are you gonna do?
I really like
your original offer.
That's not
on the table anymore.
It's gone.
This is the new offer.
You could've jumped on it right
then, but now it's ?? phew.
Yeah, I ??
O'Leary:
But think about it.
$1 million.
You know how often that happens
in "Shark Tank"?
Are you ready?
Never.
Well, um, I'd like
to come in and say
thank you for your offer,
Mark and Rohan,
but we would like
to decline.
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Wow.
No, no, please, please.
We really loved
your first offer.
Please don't tell me
you're gonna turn this down.
I was ready to
take your first offer.
You guys are gonna need
a lot of money on this thing.
It's gonna dilute.
Your 30% offer
with the line of credit,
we will show you
that we work
extraordinarily hard.
Really hard.
Guys, honestly,
the million?dollar offer
is better.
O'Leary:
It's <i>way</i> better.
The money
you're going to have to raise
is going to get you down to 10
with a lot more heavy lifting.
As soon as we get our facility,
we'll fulfill the orders
and we'll get
$1 million immediately.
But you have all the costs
associated with getting there.
That's the challenge.
And the
operational headaches.
I just want to make sure
I'm not in an alternative
universe right here.
[ Laughs ]
Are you turning down $1 million?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Yes.
Say it ain't so.
It <i>is</i> so.
Everybody in America
wants to be where you are
right now,
and you're gonna walk
out of here without $1 million?
The fact that you guys
are even offering us $1 million
just lets me know
that you guys do understand
what we're worth.
Cuban:
You're right.
No, you're right.
You're exactly right.
But you guys
are gonna take 90% of it.
O'Leary:
I can't take it.
I can't take it.
But you got to understand,
we started our company
because we really
don't want to be employees.
You're no different than we are.
I slept on the floor.
Exactly! So you know
the struggle that it takes.
Mustard and ketchup sandwiches.
I know where you're coming from.
Exactly.
We've all had
our backs up against a wall.
Exactly, so...
Guys, I don't think ??
I don't think we have a
meeting of the minds.
We're gonna have to take
the offer back and back out.
Oza:
Yeah, it's ??
I'm sorry.
Unfortunately, guys.
Deborah: I feel extraordinary,
honestly.
We walked away
from $1 million
and we're walking into
$24 million.
