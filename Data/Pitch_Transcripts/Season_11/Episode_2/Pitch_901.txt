My name is Amber Leong,
and I'm seeking $750,000...
Whoa.
...in exchange for 10% of
my company, Circadian Optics.
Wow.
Sharks, close your eyes
and imagine you're inside
a dark, windowless room.
Now open your eyes
and picture yourself outside
on a bright, sunny morning
with sun in your eyes.
Since the beginning of time,
the sun has risen in the morning
and set in the evening.
This is the cycle
of life itself.
Just like diet and exercise,
light is vital to our physical
and mental health.
We used to spend all day hunting
and foraging outside,
but today, all of us slog away
inside a dark office all day.
We're not getting enough light.
This is disrupting
our body clock
and is making us tired
and unhealthy.
But what if there was a way
we could bring the sun
right to your desk?
Now you can
with Circadian Optics.
We make
bright?light therapy lamps
that mimic the color
and the brightness of the sun.
Using this for minutes...
Whoa.
...will help set your body clock
for the day ahead.
It's a mini sun on your desk.
Sharks, help us bring more light
into people's lives.
Who's ready to turn on their day
with Circadian Optics?
And what was your inspiration
behind this?
So, I'm originally
from Malaysia,
but I currently live
in Minnesota.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, boy.
That's where
you got the accent.
That explains ?? Right there,
you've given me the answer.
In Minnesota, you see the sun
six months out of the year.
But because I was working
at a corporate job,
I didn't see the sun
12 months of the year,
and the lack of light was really
affecting my health.
I was feeling sluggish at work,
I couldn't sleep at night...
Interesting.
...and I realized the importance
of circadian rhythm and light.
So I bought
a light?therapy lamp.
I felt better
in a couple of days,
And what are
your margins, Amber?
My margin is 70%.
Whoa.
So you got to be
making money
hand over foot.
Wow.
I have been doing okay,
but I have ??
No, but ?? So if you have
70% margin,
you're selling
all online...
Mm?hmm.
...either you have
ungodly returns
or something really wrong.
So, last year,
I made $652,000.
What's this year
gonna be?
This year, I'm projected
to do $5.6 million.
What are you gonna make
on the $5.6 million?
I'm going to make $1.3 million
with the tariffs accounted for.
So you're making
20%?plus margins per take?
Yes, 25%.
Why do you need
a Shark?
Yeah, so, I am here
because I am looking for
a strategic partner
that can help take my company
to the next level.
Right now,
I'm a $5 million company,
and I sell only online.
That might be
a good thing.
If I want to go into retail,
and it's a different ??
it's such
a different ballgame ??
I want it to be worth the work.
Amber,
what is your backstory?
My personal background.
So, I'm originally
from Malaysia.
I grew up pretty poor.
I actually ??
the house that I lived in
didn't have indoor plumbing,
but I always had the dream
of coming to America.
I think too many episodes
of "Full House."
Mm.
And when it was time
to go to college,
I told my parents
I wanted to come to America,
and they said,
"Okay, let's do this together."
They cashed out
their retirement fund,
they borrowed money
from their family and friends
to send me to school here
on a one?way ticket
and school fees
and living expenses
for one semester.
But they gave everything
they could to me,
so, like, that is how much faith
they have in me.
[ Voice breaking ] Um...
in Amber's light?therapy
business, Circadian Optics,
but she wants to partner
with another Shark.
Greiner: I would like
to help you...
Mm?hmm.
Mm?hmm.
...and to blow all your wishes
all over America, this product.
Yes.
But I'd like
another Shark with me.
Okay.
Okay?
And I am looking
over at Mark.
Amber, you have to decide.
No balls, no babies, right?
No balls, no babies!
[ Chuckles ]
So...
[ Sighs ] Okay.
I know I should negotiate,
be a good business partner,
but I am here for Lori and Mark,
both of you.
You have a deal!
Cuban: Yeah!
Aah! [ Laughs ]
Oh, my God!
That's awesome.
Oh, Lori, thank you!
Thank you so much.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Mark.
Thank you.
One of
the best presentations.
One of the best.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Congrats, Amber.
Thank you.
