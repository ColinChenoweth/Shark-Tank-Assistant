Hi, Sharks.
My name is Koko.
I am asking $200,000
for 20% of the company.
In this day and age,
appearance is everything.
Sharks, what if I told you
you could look 10 years younger
without any plastic surgery
or injection?
I have found the fountain
of youth because I am...
61 years old.
Koko,
this is not easy.
Ahh.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.
Greiner:
Um, Koko, question.
Yes?
How many hours a day
do you do this?
In general, three to five
minutes per day only.
Corcoran: Wow.
Five minutes?
Because once you learn
how to do those exercises,
you can do it
when you're driving,
walking dog,
or working on computer.
It's easy to continue.
Koko, how many students
do you have?
I have taught
more than 200 people.
I charge $200
for a 1?hour session.
But, Koko, I'm confused.
It takes five minutes.
Mm?hmm.
So, what are you doing
with the other
55 minutes?
Oh.
I teach how to do some
specific exercises in detail.
Oh, I see.
Like a seminar?
It's a training seminar.
Seminar, yes.
It's personalized.
In Japan, face exercise has been
very, very popular
over a decade,
so there are many schools,
teachers,
lots of things going on.
Koko, how are you acquiring
your customers?
One of my exciting
revenue stream
is licensing the method
to other instructors.
Have you
done that already,
or are you trying
to do that?
I have two instructors
next to me,
but I'd like
to really scale more.
Are you making any money?
According to you,
this is
a million?dollar idea, right?
Yes. My lifetime sales
is only $17,000.
Koko, let me just say,
you're amazing.
Anybody who can get $17,000
from people
for face stretching,
you deserve
a lot of credit.
Thank you.
But there's no easy way
to say this,
but it's just not
a fit for me.
I'm out, Koko.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oza: Koko,
I admire your energy.
It's second to none.
You came
bouncing through there.
But I can't wrap my head
around it, unfortunately.
I'm out.
Koko.
Yes?
I think that
in the American market,
people like things fast.
I think that
in the American culture,
I don't think people
will spend all that time a day
doing it
for their face.
I think
they'd go get fillers
and, boom, it's over.
But this is all?natural,
way affordable
than those medical treatments.
No, I get it.
I get it.
But I just don't see this
working well for me.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Koko, your wonderful energy,
I love it,
but this Face Yoga thing is
really hard to make money off.
It's just ?? you're not
worth $1 million.
I'm just trying
to be pragmatic about it.
I'm out, Koko.
Thank you very much for coming.
Oza: Thank you, Koko.
Cuban:
Congratulations, Koko.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good luck. Ohh.
Corcoran: I hate to see her go.
She's fabulous.
O'Leary: Look at the back
of that dress. That's crazy.
Cuban:
That's not a dress.
I will be laughing at them when
I become very, very successful,
and if they come to me
at the time,
"Oh, Koko, please teach me
some exercise,"
no!
I will not teach them
any exercise.
[ Laughs ]
So, please leave
with your saggy face.
