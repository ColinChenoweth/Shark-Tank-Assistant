I'm Mollie Thorsen,
and this is my dad.
I'm Bob Thorsen.
And we're the Little Burros!
And we're the Little Burros!
[ Laughter ]
We're here today
seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
and she'll say,
"Bob, where's my cellphone?
Where's my rake?
Where's my iced tea?"
[ Laughter ]
And I wanted
my mornings back,
so I decided
to do something about it.
So that's why Dad created
the Burro Buddy,
a garden tray
that sits right on top
of your standard?size
wheelbarrows,
maximizing organization
while minimizing your trips
running back and forth.
The Burro Buddy can hold
your long?handled tools,
your short?handled tools,
your drink,
and even has
a water?resistant compartment
to protect your cellphone
from the elements
or from Dad's
garden?hose sprays.
And at 3 pounds,
it's lightweight
and it comes
right on and right off.
So you can use it
as a garden tray
as you move
around the yard.
Just don't forget
where you leave it.
[ Chuckling ]
Yes, Dad.
As you can see,
the Little Burros
is a family?owned business,
and we're made right here
in the USA.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to make big money
with the Little Burros?
[ Chuckles ]
Cuban: That's great.
Bob, what led you to become
wheelbarrow experts?
Tell us about
this incredible journey.
Alright.
I'm a general contractor
in Washington, D. C.
I would've bet
you were a basketball coach.
You got the sweater,
you got the demeanor.
Greiner: Yeah.
Even the way
you hold your hands.
I have three sons
who played basketball.
They were on
award?winning teams,
and so
I'm used to that, but ??
I played basketball, too.
And you played.
And your daughter,
right?
Wow!
Bob!
I did, too.
[ Laughs ]
What's <i>your</i> background?
My background ??
I actually graduated
with an art?history degree,
but growing up,
I was one of five kids,
and watching Dad
and the business,
I just love
the family business.
So, my three brothers
are involved
in the construction company,
and when I graduated,
Dad thought of this genius idea,
and he said,
"What do you think?
Do you think we can make it
and sell it?"
And I was like, "Yes."
So, my sister, Rebecca,
was our CFO,
[ Voice breaking ]
and she passed away in 2016.
Aw.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We kind of
have been making sure
that we do our part
to continue her legacy
because she helped us with
every single part of this.
So this is your baby.
It's my baby.
So why don't <i>you</i> tell us about
the sales, who's buying it?
Yeah.
Yeah, so, we are in
big?box retailers nationwide,
and we do about 2,500 a month
since January.
$25 a month?
Wow.
2,500 units a month.
That's great!
Which equates
to how much money?
Since January 1st,
we have done close to $400,000.
Wow!
Very good.
Where are you?
What retailers are you in?
Right now, we are in
Target stores nationwide.
Target.
Yes.
And we are in Menards
nationwide...
Menards.
...we're in Duluth Trading,
we're in Ace stores nationwide,
True Value stores nationwide.
And what is
the cost of one?
Packaged
and all put together,
$10.50 is
what we make it for.
We sell it $25 FOB
and $39.95 MSRP.
And we are made
in the United States.
Wait. I'm sorry.
Freight on board.
FOB to me is
"first on the boat."
So freight on board.
Yes.
Okay.
$10 ??
So we sell at $25,
and they pay
for all the shipping.
But what would you
use the money for? I don't
see you need the money.
Well,
you want $250,000.
For what?
What would you
use it for?
Well, we actually
want to build
a quality,
innovative tool?brand line.
We want to continue with this
and build more products.
All in
the gardening theme?
Yeah, we have more innovative
ideas we'd like to do,
and I would not like to keep
using Thorsen money to do it.
[ Laughter ]
Bob, how much of your own money
have you put into the business?
We've put
about a million dollars.
Ohhhhh!
John: Ohhhh!
O'Leary:
Yippee?yi?yo?ki?yay!
Greiner: Wow!
No wonder you don't want
to put any more!
Somebody's grandkids
aren't going to college.
Bob: And by the way,
you all didn't ask ??
everything's patented.
Oh, it is?
Whoa.
This is utility patent,
design patent.
Utility patent?
That's what cost you
the million dollars.
Mollie: Yeah.
So, just within the design
and engineering
and the injection mold,
that's roughly
half a million dollars alone.
That's what gave you
the gray hair, right, Bob?
When I first made
my first product,
I spent $275,000
on molds.
Right.
And it's a huge risk
to take.
Mollie, you certainly know
your numbers. I like that.
Corcoran:
I'm an avid gardener.
I'm having a hard time,
though,
because I've been gardening
my whole life,
but I never even thought to buy
a wheelbarrow, honest to God.
What I do is,
I just take a bucket
and I fill it with soil, and I
jam all my instruments in it,
and I carry it around.
So, I think your sales
are remarkable,
but, for me,
I just can't imagine using it,
and therefore, I can't really
relate to it myself.
And so, for that reason only,
I'm out.
Thank you.
The next gardening I do will be
the <i>first</i> gardening I do.
I mean, I wouldn't know
where to begin with this.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
I got to tell you, I like
everything about this story.
I love the fact that you're able
to work with your family.
I just don't know anything
about this business.
I mean, there's one person
up here that,
if it's under $50
and it's plastic...
It's Kevin!
...she's gonna sell it.
She sells more plastic
than Happy Meals here.
I sell a lot of stuff to
hardware stores, so I'm
pretty familiar with it.
Listen, I just can't help you
with this business,
but I'm really excited
about it. I love this.
Well, thank you.
I'm struggling with it,
but I'm out.
We appreciate you.
Bob, you're the inventor ??
very credible, no question ??
and, Mollie,
you're running it.
So who actually <i>owns</i>
Little Burros?
Bob: The family.
My wife
owns the biggest share.
That's usually the way
things work out, Bob.
[ Laughs ]
The problem is,
you bring an outside investor
who's not a family member,
it kind of reminds me
of my problems with
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
There's 26 family members that
own a piece of this thing now,
and it's a challenge.
The way I got around the problem
was a royalty deal
because I don't own any equity
but I get paid.
Royalty?!
And so, look,
I don't know.
I mean, it kind of fits into
my hardware business.
It's got
the same exact buyers.
What hardware
business?
What hardware business,
Kevin?
I have a huge business now
in hardware with BenjiLock.
I <i>am</i> the lock.
Oh, okay.
Oh! One product.
Yeah, but it's the biggest
lock product you've ever seen.
But he is one
with the lock.
The deal I would offer you ??
I'll make you an offer.
I'll do the $250,000.
I want a royalty
of 10 bucks a unit.
[ Laughs ]
Corcoran:
They're laughing at you.
You gonna let me
get the offer out?
Doesn't matter!
Look at Mollie.
She's laughing.
It doesn't work well
because that's about ??
O'Leary: Would you rather
<i>not</i> get an offer?
They only make
a little bit more than that.
Well, it's the same cost
as the cost of the unit.
Yeah, we'd love to hear
your offer.
We're still listening.
We're still here.
Yeah, we're listening.
O'Leary: I mean...
We're listening.
If you're not loving
the offer already ??
We're entertained by this
all day, every day.
I'm telling you, look,
the great thing about ??
But, Kevin,
that's almost half the cost
they're paying for the goods.
I don't think you're writing
a check, are you? I forgot.
They sell it for $25,
make it for $10.50...
I'm not.
...give Kevin $10
of the $15 left.
You know, talk is cheap, Mollie.
You know that.
Well, I'm glad you guys
got a wheelbarrow.
An offer is an offer.
Here you go.
And here's my offer.
$250,000 against a $7 royalty
till I get back $500,000,
and I'm only gonna take 7%
of the equity in the company.
Oh, my God. Bob.
Corcoran: What a nice guy.
Greiner: Oh, my gosh!
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.
Well, Lori,
let's hear <i>your</i> offer.
Well, you know,
I've got a problem here.
I'm not sure
that the average home
with a garden in a backyard
has a wheelbarrow.
We think that our Burro Buddy
would do great on QVC.
I'm not sure it's a TV item,
'cause it's seasonal,
so it's only gonna sell
in the summer.
I'm really torn here.
What are you gonna do,
Lori?
The $1 million in?
Whoa.
I mean, I'm like,
"How do I get anything out?"
It's a flier here.
You've only been selling
since January.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
You might not like the offer.
Bob and Mollie have one offer
on the table from Kevin
and one on the way from Lori
for their gardening?tool
company, the Little Burros.
It's a flier here.
You've only been selling
since January.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
You might not like the offer.
Ouch.
Mollie: Yeah.
It's debt, but, listen,
I'm gonna be a Little Burro.
When does the loan go away?
I get $5 royalty
till I get the loan back.
Okay.
Okay?
And then I just get 3%.
So you're getting me
grinding, burrowing.
Yeah.
But you're paying interest
<i>and</i> royalties.
Yeah. Yes.
Yeah, so you have two similar
bloodsucking offers here.
But if you are
making millions...
Lori, just to be clear ??
Corcoran: May I give you
some unbiased advice?
Barbara.
Nothing in it
for me.
Barbara, hang on.
No.
Could you be quiet
just for a minute?
John:
That's not gonna happen.
No, I want to give them advice
to walk away from both deals,
and I'll tell you why.
You already put
your million dollars in.
You already did
the heavy lifting.
You're already getting traction
within the stores.
It's like you climb
this huge hill, a painful hill,
and you came over the top,
and it's getting easy,
and then you're gonna let
these guys run up to you
and take a big bite
out of your butt.
Barbara always says that when
she's not interested in a deal.
Says Barbara,
who has no money in the deal,
not taking any risks,
just talking.
I'm not vested in it. I'm giving
you my honest opinion.
But she's right.
Talk is cheap.
Greiner: You guys know
what you want.
And listen.
There's a reason why
we're similar sitting here.
You just started
in January.
Corcoran: They're feeding off
each other's greed.
We don't know
what's gonna happen.
And, you know...
there's a lot going on here.
There's a fair amount of work
to promote this.
There's a lot
going on here.
What do you want to do?
John: What do you want to do?
I think that,
looking at this,
like, royalty isn't what
our original offer had involved,
so I don't know
that a royalty deal
is something
that we would look at.
But if you guys
were interested in equity,
we'd still really be interested
in working with you guys.
My deal is gonna stay
a royalty deal.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
And, Mollie, I don't have
any flexibility, either,
'cause I'm just
commensurate with the risk.
I look at it ?? you know, we've
done 10 years of "Shark Tank."
We've done
every kind of deal.
And we're getting very
good at understanding
our risks and rewards.
He's amazing ??
just amazing.
Yes.
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful, Barbara.
[ Laughs ]
So, all you've got
are those two offers, Bob,
and I think
they're pretty good.
You have to choose between
the two of them. Mollie
understands the numbers.
Cuban:
You don't have to choose.
Or choose nothing at all.
It's your call, Dad.
Mollie:
I know my sister, Becca,
would be, like, really,
really proud of us
because we made
a smart decision
at the end of the day.
Yes. Yeah.
And that's
the most important thing,
is making
the smart decision.
Yes.
So...
Narrator: Earlier this season,
"Shark Tank" announced
a special sweepstakes
for high school students.
Four winners won
a personal video chat
with their favorite Shark,
and the Sharks
had a special surprise
for the grand?prize winner,
Connelly.
Herjavec: Hey, guys!
Did you all know that Connelly
won the sweepstakes?
Yeah, Connelly!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Connelly:
I've been watching "Shark Tank"
for as long as I can remember.
Every Sunday night,
me and my friends watch
"Shark Tank" together.
We love it.
It's such a fun show.
In the future, I would love
to start my own business,
so this is definitely
one of the coolest things
that's ever happened to me.
Connelly,
come with us.
Cuban:
By winning the sweepstakes,
Connelly and her family
are gonna be able to come out
and visit us on set,
but that wasn't enough
for the Sharks.
We wanted to come out here
to Chattanooga, Tennessee,
and surprise
the entire school.
Let's give
a big Charger welcome
to the Sharks
from "Shark Tank."
[ Cheers and applause ]
Cuban: We're here to inspire
the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.
We also invited one of my
Shark Tank companies, Zoobean,
and Junior Library Guild
to come out and join us.
We're donating $10,000
of brand?new books.
Bookey:
We're giving every student
access to
our Beanstack software.
We want to get them fired up
about starting
their own businesses
and being the next generation
of Sharks.
Who are the people who inspired
you to be entrepreneurs?
What are some of the sacrifices
an entrepreneur must make?
How would you advise us
as teenagers to get started?
How many people here
are on TikTok?
Alright,
that's an opportunity.
Go into a business that
you think is doing
business the old way,
and you show them
how to activate social media.
Greiner: Most people out there
that have several years on you
are gonna need your help.
O'Leary:
We need more young people
to be entrepreneurs
because they're the next
generation of problem?solvers.
They see the world
in a whole new light.
Connelly posts a tweet,
and the five of us
show up today.
The impossible can happen.
[ Applause ]
Herjavec: All it takes
is one great idea.
There's one kid sitting out
there in a high school somewhere
that's gonna change the world.
Great job, Connelly.
I really appreciate
you all coming.
Well done.
Thank you.
Connelly:
This day has been incredible.
To be able to meet the Sharks
has just been
an absolute dream come true.
[ Audience chanting
"Shark Tank" ]
Greiner: The message we want
to send to these kids today is,
whatever they dream of,
whatever they want to be,
they can be entrepreneurs,
they can be successful,
and they are our future.
[ Audience cheering ]
