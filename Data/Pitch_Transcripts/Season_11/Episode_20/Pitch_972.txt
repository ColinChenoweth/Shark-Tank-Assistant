in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
alright?
You're moving your legs
at a very fast pace.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
You're moving your arms.
You see these shoulders?
You see these shoulders?
It's a whole?body movement,
and we're having fun.
You're not thinking about
the workout,
but afterward,
you'll be dripping in sweat.
Now, Sharks,
before we get down to business,
before we get down to it,
I want you to come get jiggy
with me, okay?
Do you want
to get jiggy with me?
Do you want
to get jiggy with me? No?
Corcoran: Yeah, sure.
Let's go.
Come on, come on!
I will.
Greiner:
Barb, you go ahead.
Come on, now!
Get jiggy.
Ah, yeah. Let me help you down.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you so much.
How's it going?
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you. So true.
Mr. Get Right is here
to get you right, okay?
Okay.
Now, we're gonna start
with the left foot, alright?
Left leg, we're gonna go
1, 2, 3, 4.
What number do I clap on?
Sharks: 4.
[ Laughs ]
Now, look, once you clap,
you're gonna freestyle, okay?
I want to see your freestyle.
Yeah, there you go!
Now I want to see
your money, baby.
Money, baby.
Yeah, yeah!
Sure.
I want to see you freestyle,
alright?
So, let's start
with the left leg.
Here we go.
Let's get the music.
[ <i>Hip?hop music plays</i> ]
You ready?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
Come on,
we got this, a'ight?
Here we go.
We got 'em.
Let's go.
Freestyle!
Yeah.
You better freestyle!
Right leg. Right leg.
You got it. Right.
Come on,
Ms. Barbara, yeah.
Ooh! You better get it!
You better get it!
You better...
Yeah!
Let's go.
How fun!
There you go! There you go!
Give me some. Give me some.
Good job, good job, good job.
Good job.
It wasn't that good.
[ Laughs ]
LaDonte, how do I
make any money with this?
What's the plan?
We're utilizing
the Louisiana dance style
and mixing it with aerobics,
so it's different fitness,
it's lit, it's fun.
So I pay you
for a class?
Yes, sir, a class ??
an hour class.
So, our prices
are $15 per person,
$10 per person
after 50 people.
Cuban: Where are you doing it
right now?
Right now I'm just traveling
to different states,
different regions
to expand the brand.
I do a pop?up class,
I talk to CrossFit gyms,
and we just launched
our online subscription site.
This is the stretching
and warm?up.
Once you sign up, you get the
stretching and warm?up for free,
so that way, you could get
accommodated with the style.
So, you know, you get to
experience not only, you know,
face?to?face,
but you get it at home, as well.
Okay,
you own the trademark to it?
Yeah, trademarked.
Yes, sir.
Tell us about <i>you.</i>
Alright.
Growing up, I always danced,
and I was trained
for all styles,
but, you know, being in
a single?parent home,
we weren't able
to afford it.
So I would go to YouTube,
I would go to watch
Michael Jackson old videos,
so that way, I can make sure
I'm always polished
with my dance moves, you know?
[ Laughter ]
So, once I went to college ??
to Southern University
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana ??
I don't know if you know
about Louisiana,
but their culture is very,
very strong.
And once I got involved
with the marching band,
they appointed me
as the choreographer
for the field shows,
and I had to learn
the style of dance.
I didn't know anything about
Louisiana style of dance.
And when I seen
the jiggin' dance,
they were moving so fast.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
And when it was finished,
they were drenching in sweat.
I said, "That's not a dance ??
that's a workout."
LaDonte,
you put on one class...
Yes, ma'am.
...you teach the other trainers
how to do it,
and then you leave
to another city?
No, see,
right now I'm getting ready
to start certifying trainers.
That's what the $50,000 is
for ?? is to certify trainers.
And they pay you a fee
to be trained?
They pay a one?time fee
for the certification,
and then you would pay
a monthly subscription base.
Okay, so,
what are the revenues?
Right now we had a total
of $62,000 for the year.
We only been operating
as a business for a year.
For the year?
Oh, good for you.
Yes, sir.
'Cause you want to make this
like a Zumba, correct?
Bigger than Zumba.
Ah, I see.
So you want to train people
in JiggAerobics?
But the model
is like it?
You got it.
Cuban: What year did
you graduate from Southern?
I graduated this past fall.
Oh, so you just
got out of school, huh?
I'm fresh, yes, sir.
You're fresh, okay.
Yes, sir. And now
I'm full?time JiggAerobics.
That's great.
I mean, look...
Ready to go worldwide.
...right out of school,
$62K?
Yes.
That ain't bad.
Thank you.
There's nothing wrong
with the model you've got.
I mean,
other people have done it.
But how does an investor
play into this?
Well, I'm looking for
a strategic partner.
More than the money,
I'm looking for a strategic
partner to show me the route,
how they'll be able
to capitalize off of this
in the most powerful way.
I'm an entertainer, not just a
JiggAerobics fitness instructor.
JiggAerobics could be used
for performances.
We've performed at
basketball games, at concerts.
We do it all.
Yeah.
I mean, it's a
personal?services business.
Nothing wrong with it.
I think it can grow.
You just need to leverage it up
and do four times more.
Right.
And you'll be making
100 grand a year.
Yes, sir.
It's just ?? look,
I wish you the best.
I don't know how to put $50,000
into this or what it's worth.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.
No problem.
I kind of am sitting here
thinking the same thing.
You entertain people.
That's why they want
to go to your class.
You're right.
So you're trying
to capitalize
on who you are
<i>and</i> this style of dance,
and I'm not really quite sure,
like, how to do that.
It's kind of early.
I think
you'll get there.
Yes, ma'am.
But as an investment
for me,
I'm just not sure
how I would invest in this.
So I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you. Thank you.
John: So, my train of thought
is that
I've been down this road
several times,
one with
Billy Blanks Jr.
and then another one with
my buddy/partner "Cowboy Ryan."
Rodeo Abs.
Rodeo Abs.
But it took a while
for them to figure out
the lane
that works best for them.
I just think you're a little
too early, so I'm out.
Thank you.
Corcoran: You know,
I think you were thinking
you could
get an investor in here
and your business
would speed forward.
The truth of the matter is,
it would slow you down
because the only person that
could hit the bumps in the road
and figure out
"Let's try this.
Oh, that doesn't work.
Let's try this"
is the guy
who's heading the business.
You have
so much more runway
before you would ever
need the help of anyone.
I'm looking for a strategic
partner, someone that could ??
But a strategic partner
would do what?
Put you in the right place
at the right time?
There's only one way
to get to the right place
at the right time ??
is to bumble along
until you discover
every little piece of it
on your own as an entrepreneur.
That's how everybody
grows their business.
So have a little more faith
in yourself.
I'd love to invest in you. I'm
sure you're gonna be a winner.
You know,
you just have that about you.
But there's no room
in this deal for me,
so, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Thank you.
LaDonte, your product
isn't JiggAerobics.
Your product's you,
right?
You're an entertainer.
Anybody could do a routine,
put something to music,
but you go there
and entertain, right?
Yes, sir.
And I see that.
It's not
that you need advice, right?
You just need to do
things like this and keep
on building your brand,
because the bigger your brand,
the bigger your personality,
the more events you're gonna do,
the more events you do,
the more you can charge,
the more money you'll make.
But just keep on doing
what you're doing online
and just keep on
getting bigger
and just have fun
like you're doing, man,
and then it'll take off.
You're out of school, man.
You're doing it exactly right.
I'm ready
to take over the world.
I feel like this product
is phenomenal.
Corcoran:
We believe you.
We believe you.
Give it another two or
three years, you'll be there.
We'll say, "Yeah,
we saw him on 'Shark Tank.'"
[ Corcoran laughs ]
So I can't invest, man,
but I'm excited for you.
I'll be watching.
I'll be watching your videos.
Maybe I'll even be
a subscriber.
But I'm out.
Thank you, Mr. Cuban.
Good luck, LaDonte.
Thank you.
Greiner: Good luck.
I'm feeling great.
The feedback
that I received from the Sharks
made me feel wonderful,
and they told me to go for it,
I don't need any help.
It boosted my confidence,
and I'm so ready to go
and take on the world.
