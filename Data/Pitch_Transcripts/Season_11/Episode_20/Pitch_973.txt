My name is Holly Cooper,
owner of Fried Green Tomatoes,
from Nashville, Tennessee,
Cuban:
Good job, Holly.
Thank you.
Now feed us.
[ Laughter ]
Okay. Alright.
Thank you.
This is from
our food truck.
Here you are,
babe.
Corcoran: I don't know
if I'll get my mouth around it.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Mmm!
Alright.
Whoa!
That's very good,
Holly.
This is great!
Cooper: Thank you!
Yes.
O'Leary: Holly, it's fantastic.
I love it.
The fried green tomato thing,
I just inhaled.
Mmm!
But there's so many
food trucks.
I mean,
what's the deal?
Well, actually,
it's more than a food truck.
We have a product that we sell
to retailers nationwide.
Which is
this batter mix?
Is that
what this thing is?
Cooper: Right.
We took that product to market
in 2016.
We sold in 42 states,
about 600 stores.
600?
More boutique stores.
I was in the restaurant business
for about 18 years.
John: Holly,
you have $268,000 in sales,
Cooper: Yes.
Well, this kind of math,
I can do
Congratulations, Holly.
Thank you. [ Laughs ]
