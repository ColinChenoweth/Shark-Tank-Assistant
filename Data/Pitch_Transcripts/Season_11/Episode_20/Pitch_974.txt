My name is Holly Cooper,
owner of Fried Green Tomatoes,
from Nashville, Tennessee,
and I am seeking $200,000
in exchange for 15% equity
of my company,
Fried Green Tomatoes.
Our food truck makes every item
fresh to order,
and our bacon, lettuce,
fried green tomato sandwich
is the favorite.
John: Mmm!
Mmm!
Other favorites are
our grouper sandwich,
a shrimp po'boy.
Mmm!
We have a catfish sandwich.
Oh, yeah.
But we're known best by visitors
from all over the country
for our hand?battered
fried green tomatoes,
fried pickles,
and our secret sauce.
[ Slurping ]
[ Laughter ]
Our products are flying off
the shelves in retail stores.
So, Sharks, this business
is ripe with opportunities.
So who'd like to help spread
a little bit
of Nashville's
Southern hospitality
all over the country?
Are y'all hungry?
Greiner: We are!
We're hungry.
Corcoran: Let's go.
Yay! Great job.
Cuban:
Good job, Holly.
Thank you.
Now feed us.
[ Laughter ]
Okay. Alright.
Thank you.
This is from
our food truck.
Here you are,
babe.
Corcoran: I don't know
if I'll get my mouth around it.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Mmm!
Alright.
Whoa!
That's very good,
Holly.
This is great!
Cooper: Thank you!
This is the best part of the job
and the worst part of the job.
Yeah, this is great.
So, we do a seasonal business
of special events.
However,
I just purchased a truck
that we're gonna be taking out
for more lunch events.
Our food truck is actually
a 16?foot trailer.
Most of our events,
we're doing $600 to $800
an hour in business.
Greiner: Wow!
John: Wow. Really?
Wow.
And we have customers
waiting...
So good.
...more than an hour
to get their favorites.
Really?
Wow!
Yes.
O'Leary: Holly, it's fantastic.
I love it.
The fried green tomato thing,
I just inhaled.
Mmm!
But there's so many
food trucks.
I mean,
what's the deal?
Well, actually,
it's more than a food truck.
We have a product that we sell
to retailers nationwide.
Which is
this batter mix?
Is that
what this thing is?
Cooper: Right.
We took that product to market
in 2016.
We sold in 42 states,
about 600 stores.
600?
More boutique stores.
And we'd like to get into
more of the big?box stores.
The batters cost me $1.28.
O'Leary: Yeah?
They retail for $8.99.
Cuban:
What are your sales?
We did $268,000 last year.
Good for you.
So, it's all of your sales
collectively?
Right.
I was in the restaurant business
for about 18 years.
I actually owned a small café
and actually sold that business,
and then
I got into commercial sales.
For what kind of
commercial sales?
I've sold fuel ??
commercial fuel.
I've also sold plumbing,
HVAC business,
electrical business.
[ Laughs ]
Awesome.
Wow.
So you can sell
anything.
You name it, honey,
I can sell it.
Why did you leave sales to
go back into the food business?
Oh, actually, I lost my job.
Oh.
I lost my job.
I was the number 1 sales rep
for the company,
I was number 3
in the nation...
Wow.
...and I had just sold
a state contract,
and they let me go.
So that's why I started
my business ??
so I could be in control
of my destiny.
Good for you.
Well, I'm gonna tell you
why they fired you.
They were jealous
of your talent.
I think so.
But the beauty is, is you can,
at any point in time,
take your life and your destiny
into your own hands
and you can create
a business or product,
and that's freedom,
and that's success.
Yes.
What is
your aspiration?
I would love to be able
to franchise our food truck.
You want to franchise?
And I have had more than a dozen
people want to buy a franchise,
and I just don't really know
how to do that,
so I'd love some help.
Not to be negative,
but, you know,
I have to speak the truth ??
I <i>am</i> Mr. Wonderful.
$200,000 for 15%
means you value the business
for $1.3 million.
To pay $1.3 million for
this business is very difficult.
If you had
an already established
series of franchisees
that were making money,
that makes it
more believable
that you could pour gasoline
on the fire and make it bigger.
Right.
But you don't
have that yet.
Look, I think
the food's fantastic.
Good!
But it's just too small.
It's not investable.
I'm out.
I understand.
Like I said,
I've had restaurants,
and I've done more dollars
out of a food truck
than I've done in a café.
What you've done
is really quite amazing,
and I'm sure you're having
a whole lot more fun...
I am.
...working for yourself.
That's exactly right.
I loved what I ate,
but I'm that person
that goes for the healthy,
the light, the low?fat,
so the product's not right
for me.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you. Thank you.
John: Holly,
you have $268,000 in sales,
and that is a combination
of the truck
as well as the product
in retailers.
Yes.
I actually just brought
my daughter on full time.
Sure.
So with the two of us,
we can definitely
more than double those numbers
this year.
It's nice that
you brought in your daughter,
but in order
to really take an investment
and accelerate
the growth...
Yes.
...you have to get
that point where,
"Okay, how can I get to
five employees?
How can I get
to 10 employees?"
Right.
And that's something,
really,
that an entrepreneur
has to go through.
I just don't think
you're investable yet,
so for those reasons, I'm out,
but congratulations.
I remember when
the Cousins Maine Lobster boys
came in here,
the two cousins...
Yes.
...the most important question
they answered was,
"How much
are you doing a day?"
And they had only been
in business three months.
Yes.
And they said,
"$5,000 a day."
We've done $6,400 a day,
has been our top.
So that's more than
$3 million a year
if you had your trucks open
six or seven days a week.
Right.
All of a sudden,
Barb can do math.
Cooper: Yes.
Well, this kind of math,
I can do
because I know it
inside and out.
You obviously can sell
like crazy.
I can.
Well, I am
your dream partner.
Okay, but I'm gonna
have to be very well?paid
because I can do
so much for you
and I can make you rich
within two years ??
no doubt in my mind.
Oh, my Lord.
Let me tell you something.
You can make an empire
of franchises out of this.
But the important ingredients
that those two cousins have is,
boy, can they sell
Yeah.
and, boy,
are they organized.
Yes.
As a result of that,
they have $60 million in sales
three years later.
I know. I want to be them!
[ Laughs ]
You <i>will</i> be them.
No doubt in my mind
you will be them.
So, I'll offer you the $200,000
for 30% of your business.
Cuban:
That's a no?brainer.
No, think about it.
It really is.
Wait a minute!
Now that I saw Barbara
all over this
like a truffle pig
on a truffle...
[ Laughs ]
...I'll give you
$200,000 for 25%.
And he doesn't know a damn thing
about the franchise business.
So?!
Stay here. Stay here.
Corcoran:
And he's a guy.
I love you.
I really do.
Greiner:
What are you gonna do?
You save 5%
on the Daymond discount.
Yeah.
Congratulations, Holly.
Thank you. [ Laughs ]
Corcoran: It was like
taking candy from a baby.
Why didn't you guys want
that business? It's a gold mine.
You never know what's gonna
happen on "Shark Tank."
It was worth giving up a little
more equity to get Barbara
because I knew that she had the
experience to do what we needed,
and she's the Shark I was after,
and so we're thrilled
to have her as a partner.
