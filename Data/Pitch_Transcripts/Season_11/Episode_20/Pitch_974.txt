Oh.
And my name's Emily.
I put the "M"...
...in "mural painting"!
[ Laughter ]
Mural painting is one of
the most effective ways
Cuban: Look, Emily,
it's a great business.
The challenge I have is just
scaling it to be big enough.
You know,
as an owner/operator,
you know, you could grow
to $2 million,
It's an unusual deal,
Emily.
It's hot right now, though!
No, I know, I know.
Everybody wants a mural!
I mean, after you've seen me,
you're gonna be looking around
Alright, look,
you're a funky chicken, Emily.
[ Laughter ]
I like that.
It's a different
kind of deal.
Look, I'll do the $300,000
for...
Emily is seeking $300,000
for a 15% stake
in her advertising company,
Mural Painter.
Kevin has offered her $300,000
for 35% of her company.
I'm not sure about
this business.
I think that Kevin's offer
is a good offer ??
a little aggressive.
I'd like
to beat him up for you
There's only one
Mr. Wonderful, Emily.
I'm sure.
I'm gonna stick with my offer.
I'm comfortable with it.
If I take your offer,
you're a partner of mine,
so I value everything
that you ??
What do you see
for what happens next?
I think
what you have to do
You're all over the place.
From what you said,
I think you're mostly
an administrator at this point.
What a waste
of your talent.
I completely agree.
So I can teach you
how to structure your business
where it makes optimal sense
of your talent, alright?
Would you suggest
a sales team?
I wouldn't say
a sales team, no.
I bet you most of your business
is coming to you,
versus you going out
for it.
Correct.
That means there's a lot
of business to be had.
Anybody who listens to you
is gonna fall in love with you.
I would've never guessed
you would've got two offers,
I got to tell you,
the beginning of the pitch...
So, what do you want to do?
Cuban: Congrats, Emily.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much, guys!
Well done.
Strauss:
I am so excited for the future.
I am so grateful
for this opportunity.
I've worked so hard for this.
I got a deal with exactly
who I came in for
at exactly my asking price ??
just sliced up differently.
