Oh.
And my name's Emily.
I put the "M"...
...in "mural painting"!
[ Laughter ]
Mural painting is one of
the most effective ways
to grab audiences' attention
and engage with...
the Millennials.
Picture this.
What if this gorgeous mural
was a promo
for "Shark Tank" season 11?
It would be
all over social media.
Check it out.
Hey, look at you, Daymond!
Mark, you're looking good!
Of course.
Kevin, watch out!
Save the money!
[ Laughter ]
Looking good, ladies.
Mural painting
and hand?painted signage
was considered a lost art
not too long ago.
Now it's more desirable
than any other form of
semipermanent media out there.
On the flip side,
Mural Painter creates jobs
for artists
where they can still
do what they love,
beautify neighborhoods,
and feed their families.
How cool is that?
We're ready to expand,
so we're developing an app
which allows artists
and customers
to be matched
throughout the U. S.
So, Sharks, who's ready to
paint the town green with me ??
money?green?!
[ Laughter ]
How did you come up
with this idea?
So, I was always an artist.
When I was 16, my parents,
who are freakin' awesome,
they let me paint all over
the kitchen cabinets, right?
So, my mom,
she worked from home,
so her clients would have to
walk through the kitchen,
and they all saw
the kitchen cabinets,
and they're like,
"Oh, my God! Who did this?"
So they started hiring me,
and their friends
started hiring me,
and then
it snowballed from there
into a word?to?mouth business
around my neighborhood.
And then, around 17,
I got really, really sick.
I got, like, a late?stage case
of Lyme disease.
It was very, very severe.
So I couldn't walk.
I couldn't really hold
a paintbrush or do anything.
Wow.
And it ultimately ??
I ended up having to drop out
of high school.
So, I survived Lyme.
I got better.
I ended up getting my GED.
I ended up taking
some college classes
at FIT, in fine arts,
and the mural industry
completely exploded.
So, to to keep up
with the demand,
I kind of had to fake it
till I made it.
There's some guys up here
still doing that.
[ Laughter ]
I had to turn to my college
fine?art classmates and be like,
"Hey, you want to make
like 50 bucks this weekend
and help me with this mural?"
But then, eventually,
assistants turned into employees
and small jobs
turned into big jobs,
and before I knew it,
MP was born.
Do you have any examples
of your work that we can see?
Yeah.
So, maybe you recognize
Bantam Bagels.
You did that for us?
Yeah!
Well, we do a lot
of hand?painted signage
in the
brick?and?mortar locations,
a lot of
hand?painted advertisements,
as you can see
in the third example,
as well as faux finishing.
Corcoran: How do you find
and vet your artists?
So, actually, right now
we have an East Coast
and a West Coast branch
in New York, Los Angeles,
and Chicago.
Every time we want to launch
in a new city,
we do an artist call.
We vet them
very, very heavily.
O'Leary: So you're
an artist agency?
I would say we are run
like a construction company,
but for artists.
That's a great description.
[ Laughs ]
And so, are you taking
a commission or a ??
No, they're hourly.
Give me an example.
Okay, I want to paint
that mural.
How much do you charge me
for that?
So, something like that, 8x8,
would be around $15,000.
O'Leary: $15,000?
$15,000?
How many days would it take
to do that?
About three days.
And what
are you paying them?
They start at $16 an hour.
Is it typically one artist
working on your 8x8?
Or how many?
Around two.
Two? Okay.
So if you're paying them
$15 an hour to start
and they're working
a 10?hour day,
that's $150 times 2.
$300 a day
times 3 to 4 days?
Right.
$1,200,
and you're charging $15K?
And is all that margin,
or what other costs
are associated with that?
We try to estimate
when we do our bidding.
We try to keep it
at a 40% to 50% means.
So, in this calendar year,
what are your revenues gonna be?
We're projected to land
at $800,000.
Yeah?
What are you gonna make
on the $800,000?
About $100,000.
That's after
paying yourself, though.
I pay myself only around,
like, $23,000.
Corcoran:
How do you live on $23,000
Wow.
in a city like New York?
[ Laughs ]
Uh, it's interesting.
[ Laughs ]
I did have to go through
the eating the bread sandwiches.
[ Laughs ]
I ended up leaving FIT
and lived on the couch
in the Bronx
in a really bad neighborhood.
[ Laughs ]
But you can now afford
to give yourself more than that.
I <i>can</i> afford
to live myself.
I live five blocks away
from the office
'cause I work 17 hours a day,
so I have no time to commute.
O'Leary:
You know, obviously,
there's nothing proprietary
about what you're doing.
Right.
But the margins
look good.
They're <i>very</i> good.
What do you need
the $300,000 for?
So, I have a three?step plan
for that $300,000.
Step 1 ?? I want to launch
in a few more cities, right?
And then any of the extra funds,
use for marketing,
as well as our
dispatching system that we have.
I want to make a customized one,
special for our needs.
Who else
are you competing with?
We have very,
very few competitors
that would take on
a $15,000 mural.
Our other competitors
that are in the media space,
they won't touch a job
under, like, $50K.
Cuban: Look, Emily,
it's a great business.
The challenge I have is just
scaling it to be big enough.
You know,
as an owner/operator,
you know, you could grow
to $2 million,
make hopefully $1 million
and put it in your pocket,
and that's great.
I just ?? I'd have
a hard time seeing
how I could help you get
to $5?, $10?, $20 million.
So, as proud I am
and excited for you as I am,
for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you so much, Mark.
It's an unusual deal,
Emily.
It's hot right now, though!
No, I know, I know.
Everybody wants a mural!
I mean, after you've seen me,
you're gonna be looking around
and be like,
"There's murals everywhere!"
You are so strong
and so resourceful.
Sometimes,
the strongest swords
are forged in
the hottest fires.
If you're thinking
of going out,
I will be, seriously, the
hardest worker you'll ever meet.
I understand the industry
more than anyone else,
backwards and forwards.
I've grown this
from the ground up.
I've grown this
from $12 an hour
to $1.4 million in sales
to date,
and that's only counted
at 2 1/2 years.
I'm on my game.
Like, I want to grow this
so much.
Alright, look,
you're a funky chicken, Emily.
[ Laughter ]
I like that.
It's a different
kind of deal.
Look, I'll do the $300,000
for...
Emily is seeking $300,000
for a 15% stake
in her advertising company,
Mural Painter.
Kevin has offered her $300,000
for 35% of her company.
I'm not sure about
this business.
I think that Kevin's offer
is a good offer ??
a little aggressive.
I'd like
to beat him up for you
and get him to come down
in his percentage.
O'Leary:
What are you gonna do?
I'll circle back to that.
I'm spunky.
But I don't think
it's right for me.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Barbara,
if you need any clarification
in relation
to what Lori said...
Corcoran: I do.
...I'm more than happy to
kind of talk you through it.
I think the key to the business
is twofold.
One ?? your artists.
You've got that covered.
The other piece
is the client relationship ??
the big ad agencies,
the smaller agencies.
I think
there's so much more depth
in the client market
to sell to.
What disturbs me
is that you focused on
doing a small business <i>again</i>
somewhere else,
versus taking your roots
and making a big?ass business
out of it.
Well, what would you
suggest, then?
Do we turn them down?
I would suggest
you not worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
And let me tell you why.
I remember
when I was building
my New York City?based
brokerage firm.
I had a phenomenal client
who moved to Connecticut
with all their
corporate executives,
and I thought I was prudent
in following them out there
and opening a big office.
I lost my shirt.
But, more importantly,
my core business stopped growing
for almost two years because
of that stupid sidewinder.
I didn't realize the depth
of the New York City market
for me to build my business
by a hundredfold,
and that's
what I focused on.
I do want
to make you an offer
just so you don't get in bed
with this creepy guy.
[ Laughter ]
'Cause that would be
a mistake
'cause there's nothing
he could do for your business.
O'Leary: I ?? I ??
I'll give you the $100,000
of the $300,000 as cash.
Okay?
And I'll give you
a $200,000 line of credit.
That's the only way the numbers
actually make sense ??
for 15%.
I was gonna ask 20%,
but I really want to save you
from this character, okay?
Really, I mean it.
You wouldn't like him
to do business with ?? truly.
There's only one
Mr. Wonderful, Emily.
I'm sure.
I'm gonna stick with my offer.
I'm comfortable with it.
If I take your offer,
you're a partner of mine,
so I value everything
that you ??
What do you see
for what happens next?
I think
what you have to do
You're all over the place.
From what you said,
I think you're mostly
an administrator at this point.
What a waste
of your talent.
I completely agree.
So I can teach you
how to structure your business
where it makes optimal sense
of your talent, alright?
Would you suggest
a sales team?
I wouldn't say
a sales team, no.
I bet you most of your business
is coming to you,
versus you going out
for it.
Correct.
That means there's a lot
of business to be had.
Anybody who listens to you
is gonna fall in love with you.
I would've never guessed
you would've got two offers,
I got to tell you,
the beginning of the pitch...
So, what do you want to do?
Cuban: Congrats, Emily.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much, guys!
Well done.
Strauss:
I am so excited for the future.
I am so grateful
for this opportunity.
I've worked so hard for this.
I got a deal with exactly
who I came in for
at exactly my asking price ??
just sliced up differently.
And my equity ??
Oh, my gosh.
[ Laughs ]
