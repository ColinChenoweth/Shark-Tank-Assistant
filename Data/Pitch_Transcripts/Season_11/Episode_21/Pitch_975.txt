But thank you so much
for your offer!
My son's coming after you!
?Oh! Thank you!
?Thank you so much!
Congratulations.
This is awesome.
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad
you decided...
You're such a smart cookie.
Mom, congrats.
Oh, gosh, Lori!
Thank you so much!
Well done.
You're an inventor.
Oh, it's gonna be so good.
You're an entrepreneur.
It's awesome.
Oh, thank you so much.
Give me the five.
You killed it.
Killed it.
Greiner: Amazing.
I had no idea that was coming.
What that tells me
is this thing
might even be bigger
than we had hoped.
Check it out!
Four years ago,
we were in Las Vegas at CES
in a long audition line
for "Shark Tank."
Today, we are dead?set
on being
a multibillion?dollar company
that helps everyone
to get good sleep.
Sacca: The future
for Hatch is limitless,
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Ming Zhao.
I'm from San Francisco,
California.
I'm here to seek $500,000
for 5% equity
in my company.
Here it comes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sharks, what is
the one thing
Ming, the MIT database
you referenced,
I assume, if I started
Mr. Wonderful Skin Care,
I could also access
that data, right?
No, it's proprietary to us.
Zhao: That is exactly
what we're doing.
Starting with the database,
we then partner
with the head of dermatology
at Stanford University
to then actually distill
from the data
what are things that
he's seen as clinical research.
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
[ Laughter ]
What'd you say?
Let's go to sales.
$500,000 for 5% imputes
a $10 million value,
so I'm so excited
about your sales.
They're gonna be great.
?Sure. [ Laughs ]
So, we were in our beta trial
for two months
earlier this year.
We gained $110,000 in sales.
So that's a huge ??
Greiner: How do you feel
about that, Ming?
Because we have
greater ambitions.
We're trying to be a
technology?enabled CPG company,
None.
Yeah, but, Ming,
I have been pitched
at least six AI?driven
cosmetic companies
in the last six months.
Yeah.
But did they win MIT's AI
Technology of the Year Award?
[ Laughs ]
Do they have any proof?
Just 'cause you
win an award ??
John: Ming, while we're still
on the numbers, though,
let's just go down
the numbers.
Yeah.
So, okay, how much money
have you raised?
We've raised $6 million.
Ohh!       Ohh!
Ohh!                        Ohh!
There you go!
Wow.
?Yippee?yi?yo?yi?yay!
?Yeah!
This story is very unusual.
Let's take your sales
this year.
Let's just be
the most optimistic
we can be about PROVEN.
Give it to me.
We're projecting to do
$3 million, the fiscal year.
Wow.
O'Leary: Your customer
acquisition
is the cost of sales.
You make $110,000 in sales,
you spend $90,000.
It's almost one?to?one.
So, you don't care about that,
except you got to raise
more dough.
Right.
Next year,
on the $3 million...
?Mm?hmm.
?...you think you'll break even?
Um, not yet.
We'll break even
the year after.
Cuban: So, wait.
So, effectively,
on your next year's
$3 million,
you are planning
on spending
$2 million or so
in advertising, correct?
That's right.
Okay.
So you're buying
your sales.
So, it's one thing to say
"My technology is amazing,"
but when you do that,
there should be
customer referrals.
You're saying, effectively,
that you're not expecting
anything from your existing
customer base,
because you're having
to buy all your sales.
That's actually not true.
It's a business decision
we're making
to keep on experimenting with
new channels, new methodology.
If we want to be profitable
next year, we can be.
So, Ming, um, so,
I'm really not
in the skin?care stuff,
you know?
My mommy gave me
some great skin for my birthday.
Look, Ming, the AI stuff
doesn't add up to me.
I don't think that there's
a lot of organic growth
that's built into this,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
I've spent actually a decent
amount of time in this space.
I absolutely believe
the world is coming
where everyone out there
is gonna have
personalized skin care,
but, again,
the data's not there yet.
Mm.
So for those
reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Listen, Ming, I think
you have a good idea,
but I think it's just
way too early for me.
You are really just
out of the gates.
You've already
taken in $6 million.
Ming, I thank you very much
for coming here today
because
you are living proof
that my anger?management
training is working.
[ Laughter ]
Because what I wanted to do
is shred you to pieces.
This valuation
is absolutely ridiculous.
Ming, it's very important
that you leave now.
Alright.
Thank you very much.
?Thank you.
?Good luck, Ming.
?Good luck, Ming.
?Good luck, Ming!
?Good luck.
Zhao: I feel like, at the
beginning of any innovation,
ABii is transforming
how students learn
through the power of
artificial intelligence.
She not only
tracks performance,
but also attention
to ensure
that she adapts every lesson
for every student every time.
ABii also delivers
We're collecting
timing on screens.
We're also collecting attention.
How does it know?
That's also being recorded.
We look at the head orientation,
