I'd love to entertain
a royalty deal with you.
I am reluctant
on the royalty,
Like,
I love the family side.
I'm known for a big family.
Yeah.
Like, there's a lot
we could do.
It's just the royalty.
It's just, you know...
Yeah, but it's 250K.
Yeah, but I could be giving you
50 cent from every unit I sell.
That could be my entire
profit margin.
Love you.
I mean, you're, like Mark said,
the real deal.
The American dream.
This is fantastic.
So, here's our offer.
Our offer is we're gonna
give you $100,000,
no royalty,
20% split between us.
?Whoa.
?Ohh.
?That's it.
?Wow.
?20% will help you grow...
O'Leary: Oh, that's a lot
of equity.
Wojcicki: There, you're really
giving up a lot.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Brad Johnston.
I'm Lisa Love.
Hey, Brad, what does
"Tanoshi" mean, anyway?
Thanks for asking,
Greg.
[ Party horns honk ]
[ Laughs ]
We named our company
Tanoshi
because we want kids everywhere
to be successful ??
Brad, I <i>hate</i> the hardware space
you're in.
PC commodity business ??
brutal.
You need capital to buy
razor?thin margin product,
which I hate a lot.
I spent 15 years of my career
selling 6? to 12?year?olds.
The other thing
you're missing here
is customer acquisition costs.
Getting those kids
at the right time is hard ??
very hard.
Yes.
It <i>is</i> difficult.
They have no credit cards,
those kids.
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
Their parents do.
Johnston:
That is correct,
Wow.
So, Brad, you're driven by
a bit of a social mission,
'cause you're all?in,
right?
Yes. 100% in. 110%.
With any additional money
invested?
Brad?a?tola,
take that deal.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner:
[ Laughing ] What?
Brings our valuation down
quite a bit.
No, it brings your <i>business</i>
quite up a bit.
Brad?a?tola?
It brings your upside
up a lot higher.
Brad, imagine if you were
unshackled from hardware
how fantastic
this pitch would be.
Gonna educate some kids.
Love: This is great!
Congratulations, guys.
Good luck, you guys.
?Thank you.
?Thank you all very much.
?Congrats, guys.
?Good luck.
Johnston: So, now that we got
Daymond on board,
we're gonna be able to
scale so much quicker.
We're really gonna be able to
do what our mission is ??
to make learning
fun for every child.
I love to get in early
in companies.
This is the opportunity to get
in early before we get there.
So...
Let's see how they're doing now.
What I love about
Restore is it's taken
I forgot to mention one thing
that you would love.
I've been taking anger
management, so...
[ Laughter ]
I forgot to mention one thing
you would love.
We also have a licensing
agreement for $3.5 million.
$3.5 million?
That's right,
to use our technology.
They want us to create an
adjacent category database
in the baby?care space.
That's interesting.
If you really have something
proprietary with data
that you can sell other large
players in the skin space
So, I'd love to show you
how ABii works,
if you're ready to
see it in action.
Great.
Roll it.
[ <i>Upbeat music plays</i> ]
So, obviously, that's
an abbreviated lesson,
but I wanted to show you
at least
I had a love for education,
I had a love for technology,
Let me just jump in.
So, I love the education space,
but, for me, with 220 students
who have used it so far
that segregates you
from anybody
who can possibly consider
getting into this space?
