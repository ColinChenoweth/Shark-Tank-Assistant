But thank you so much
for your offer!
My son's coming after you!
?Oh! Thank you!
?Thank you so much!
Congratulations.
This is awesome.
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad
you decided...
You're such a smart cookie.
Mom, congrats.
Oh, gosh, Lori!
Thank you so much!
Well done.
You're an inventor.
Oh, it's gonna be so good.
You're an entrepreneur.
It's awesome.
Oh, thank you so much.
Give me the five.
You killed it.
Killed it.
Greiner: Amazing.
I had no idea that was coming.
What that tells me
is this thing
might even be bigger
than we had hoped.
Check it out!
Four years ago,
we were in Las Vegas at CES
in a long audition line
for "Shark Tank."
Today, we are dead?set
on being
a multibillion?dollar company
that helps everyone
to get good sleep.
Sacca: The future
for Hatch is limitless,
and I have no doubt this will be
one of the biggest companies
in the history of "Shark Tank."
Eat your heart out,
every other Shark
who passed on this deal.
Together: Hatch!
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a product line
that utilizes data
in a unique way.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Ming Zhao.
I'm from San Francisco,
California.
I'm here to seek $500,000
for 5% equity
in my company.
Here it comes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sharks, what is
the one thing
that we all search
and pay a lot of money for?
The youth of our skin.
The problem is,
most beauty companies
box us into four
crude categories ??
dry, oily, sensitive, normal ??
even though our skin
is really complex,
dooming us into an endless cycle
of expensive trial and error.
That's why I took matters
into my own hands
to change the skin?care industry
once and for all.
Introducing PROVEN skin care.
Using artificial intelligence
and cutting?edge science,
we create a personalized
and effective skin?care regimen
engineered for your skin
and your lifestyle.
To assess your skin,
simply log on to our website
to fill out your free
three?minute
Skintelligence quiz.
Questions cover everything
from your skin concerns
to your stress levels
to your locality
and even uncovers
your pollution levels.
Then, using our award?winning
Skin Genome Project database,
our scientists create your own
PROVEN 3 skin?care routine ??
a personalized cleanser,
a personalized night cream,
and a personalized day SPF,
all packed with the right
powerhouse ingredients for you.
At PROVEN, we're using science,
technology,
and hundreds
of ingredient combinations
to create the product
that works for you.
Sharks, it is inevitable
that artificial intelligence
will be the future
of flawless skin,
so who is ready to shake up
this industry with me?
And this is samples?
That's right.
So, based on what we know
about you, Sharks,
we've created products that
are personalized to you.
PROVEN is for men,
as well?
That's right. We have ?? About
20% of our customers are men.
So, Daymond.
Yes.
You travel a lot for your
speaking engagements.
Yeah.
So we put in ingredients to
help protect your skin
from the dry cabin air.
Lori, you're on TV,
putting on, taking off
makeup every day,
so we put in ingredients
to help your skin
protect your skin barrier.
Kevin, Ontario has
really hard water,
so we put in citrus ingredients
to cut down on
the mineral deposits.
Anne, as a tech entrepreneur in
front of your computer screen,
phone screens all day,
so we put in ingredients
to help protect your skin
from the digital pollution,
HEV, and blue light.
Mark, Dallas actually
has really polluted air,
so we put in ingredients to
help protect your skin
from the environmental
pollution.
Thank you.
So, when you invest
in PROVEN skin care,
you're actually investing in a
technology?first CPG company.
The database is called
the Skin Genome Project.
It is the largest
beauty database in the world,
and it has won MIT's AI
Technology of the Year Award.
But this is just the beginning,
so we're going to create
this new category
of personalized CPG
and be the category killer.
Ming, the MIT database
you referenced,
I assume, if I started
Mr. Wonderful Skin Care,
I could also access
that data, right?
No, it's proprietary to us.
We built it ourselves, and
we won the award ourselves.
Can you explain what
that is, this Skin Genome?
So, what we've done
is we've taken
all the available information
that is out there ??
more than 20 million
consumer reviews,
more than 4,000
clinical research papers ??
gathered all of that,
made sense of it,
and then made insights
and actions out of it.
In this case, the first one
is creating
our own personalized
skin?care line.
So your technology
essentially
is going through all
the different reviews
that are out there
in the publications
and then synthesizing that
into novel insights?
That's right.
But then there's not actually
any genetics or anything.
Right now, there is not.
With the genetic
information ??
I was getting excited.
Can you explain
novel insights?
Sort of a novel ??
like a brand?new kind of idea
or, you know, discovery.
So, our novel insight
is trying to understand
for different people,
different backgrounds,
different genetics,
under different environments,
different lifestyles,
what ingredients work well
for this subsegment of
the population versus another.
PROVEN is a brand
in the brutally competitive
skin?care market,
of which
there are massive players.
Mm?hmm.
Now, you have to
explain that story,
'cause nothing explains
what you just said.
That's gonna cost a fortune
to do that.
The skin science is what
we always call
kind of the voodoo science.
There's a lot of money
in this space,
but I haven't seen a lot of
really rigorous studies.
Very little science.
Have you ever heard
of PROVEN before?
No.
Zhao: That is exactly
what we're doing.
Starting with the database,
we then partner
with the head of dermatology
at Stanford University
to then actually distill
from the data
what are things that
he's seen as clinical research.
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
[ Laughter ]
What'd you say?
Let's go to sales.
$500,000 for 5% imputes
a $10 million value,
so I'm so excited
about your sales.
They're gonna be great.
?Sure. [ Laughs ]
So, we were in our beta trial
for two months
earlier this year.
We gained $110,000 in sales.
Where were you selling?
And from what channel?
We were selling mostly
through digital channels,
through Facebook.
Facebook ads.
Facebook ads.
How much did you spend
to get
that $110,000 in sales?
So, we spent about
$90,000 to get to ??
Okay.
You spent $90,000
to get $110,000?
That's right.
?Okay. Then what happened?
?Ooh.
And then, four weeks ago,
we relaunched a new website
with new branding.
Right.
And this month,
we're also on track
to do about $65,000.
I'm really working
with this.
So that's a huge ??
Greiner: How do you feel
about that, Ming?
Because we have
greater ambitions.
We're trying to be a
technology?enabled CPG company,
and how many of those
can you think of?
None.
Yeah, but, Ming,
I have been pitched
at least six AI?driven
cosmetic companies
in the last six months.
Yeah.
But did they win MIT's AI
Technology of the Year Award?
[ Laughs ]
Do they have any proof?
Just 'cause you
win an award ??
I mean, you know
how many times ??
And it's been proven
and tested out by many, and it's
been seen by many sci??
John: Ming, while we're still
on the numbers, though,
let's just go down
the numbers.
Yeah.
So, okay, how much money
have you raised?
We've raised $6 million.
Ohh!       Ohh!
Ohh!                        Ohh!
There you go!
Wow.
?Yippee?yi?yo?yi?yay!
?Yeah!
This story is very unusual.
Let's take your sales
this year.
Let's just be
the most optimistic
we can be about PROVEN.
Give it to me.
We're projecting to do
$3 million, the fiscal year.
Wow.
O'Leary: Your customer
acquisition
is the cost of sales.
You make $110,000 in sales,
you spend $90,000.
It's almost one?to?one.
So, you don't care about that,
except you got to raise
more dough.
Right.
Next year,
on the $3 million...
?Mm?hmm.
?...you think you'll break even?
Um, not yet.
We'll break even
the year after.
Cuban: So, wait.
So, effectively,
on your next year's
$3 million,
you are planning
on spending
$2 million or so
in advertising, correct?
That's right.
Okay.
So you're buying
your sales.
So, it's one thing to say
"My technology is amazing,"
but when you do that,
there should be
customer referrals.
You're saying, effectively,
that you're not expecting
anything from your existing
customer base,
because you're having
to buy all your sales.
That's actually not true.
It's a business decision
we're making
to keep on experimenting with
new channels, new methodology.
If we want to be profitable
next year, we can be.
So, Ming, um, so,
I'm really not
in the skin?care stuff,
you know?
My mommy gave me
some great skin for my birthday.
[ Laughter ]
You know, a little chocolate
and everything.
It's amazing.
So I'm not gonna
waste your time.
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
Look, Ming, the AI stuff
doesn't add up to me.
I don't think that there's
a lot of organic growth
that's built into this,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
I've spent actually a decent
amount of time in this space.
My company, 23andMe,
we've actually done
a number of partnerships looking
at the genetics of skin care.
I absolutely believe
the world is coming
where everyone out there
is gonna have
personalized skin care,
but, again,
the data's not there yet.
Mm.
So for those
reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Listen, Ming, I think
you have a good idea,
but I think it's just
way too early for me.
You are really just
out of the gates.
You've already
taken in $6 million.
And it's gonna be
a long time
before I would
see back my money.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
Ming, I thank you very much
for coming here today
because
you are living proof
that my anger?management
training is working.
[ Laughter ]
Because what I wanted to do
is shred you to pieces.
This valuation
is absolutely ridiculous.
But here we are,
and the answer is...
no.
I'm out.
Ming, it's very important
that you leave now.
Alright.
Thank you very much.
?Thank you.
?Good luck, Ming.
?Good luck, Ming.
?Good luck, Ming!
?Good luck.
Zhao: I feel like, at the
beginning of any innovation,
people don't understand.
There are always gonna be
nonbelievers and naysayers,
but that's not going to faze me.
I'm gonna keep doing
what I'm doing.
I was expecting that, you know?
Having watched so much
"Shark Tank,"
I actually think his
anger?management training
[ Laughs ]
ABii is transforming
how students learn
through the power of
artificial intelligence.
She not only
tracks performance,
but also attention
to ensure
that she adapts every lesson
for every student every time.
ABii also delivers
national standards?aligned
lessons
to make sure that kids
stay on track.
With her innovative way
of tutoring,
ABii is changing the future for
millions of kids everywhere.
So, tell me, Sharks,
who's ready to fuse
education and technology
to create a whole new world
of learning?
Oh, go on.
But, seriously, Sharks,
who's in?
Kevin, they made
a doll out of you.
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary: Well...
I think she said
ABii was a she.
She is a she.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Very light.
We're collecting
timing on screens.
We're also collecting attention.
How does it know?
That's also being recorded.
We look at the head orientation,
and then we know
that that head orientation
corresponds
to where the screen is.
Now we're getting into what
makes it unique, right?
Now we start to understand
what differentiates you
from a little Teddy bear
sitting there.
Sure.
