and so I kind of
love the team.
Thank you.
My son has also been watching
the show all the time,
and he loves royalty deals,
so if I don't come away
with a royalty deal,
I'll really be in trouble.
Okay.
Like, 23andMe, my company,
like, we do a ton
on social media,
and I think, you know,
we really connect also
with families,
and I can get the word out.
So I'm actually ??
I'd love to entertain
a royalty deal with you.
I am reluctant
on the royalty,
and here's why ??
especially given that we may
have to reduce our prices,
if we scale to market,
our profit might be
a dollar per unit.
Here's how we'll
solve your problem.
Yeah.
The power we have together
is ridiculous.
We'll split the deal.
We'll split it.
And we'll take
50 cents each.
Like,
I love the family side.
I'm known for a big family.
Yeah.
Like, there's a lot
we could do.
It's just the royalty.
It's just, you know...
Yeah, but it's 250K.
Yeah, but I could be giving you
50 cent from every unit I sell.
That could be my entire
profit margin.
Well, Mark and I want to
throw in something.
Okay.
Bring it on.
You guys are wonderful.
Love you.
I mean, you're, like Mark said,
the real deal.
The American dream.
This is fantastic.
So, here's our offer.
Our offer is we're gonna
give you $100,000,
no royalty,
20% split between us.
?Whoa.
?Ohh.
?That's it.
?Wow.
?20% will help you grow...
O'Leary: Oh, that's a lot
of equity.
Wojcicki: There, you're really
giving up a lot.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Brad Johnston.
I'm Lisa Love.
And I'm Greg Smith,
and we're from
San Francisco, California.
We are seeking $500,000
for 8% equity...
[ Groans ]
...in our company...
Together: Tanoshi!
Hey, Brad, what does
"Tanoshi" mean, anyway?
Thanks for asking,
Greg.
[ Party horns honk ]
[ Laughs ]
We named our company
Tanoshi
because we want kids everywhere
to be successful ??
in school and life ??
all while having fun.
Now, Sharks,
let's face it.
With all the crazy,
crazy content
on the Internet these days,
it's no wonder
parents are worried
about what their kids
might see online.
But in reality,
in order for kids to keep up,
they need technology
to develop the skills
for future success.
So, let us introduce you
to the Tanoshi 2?in?1,
a two?in?one
tablet and computer
preloaded with age?appropriate
and educational content
where kids can do
their homework,
they can play games,
they can
even learn to code.
With our built?in
parental controls,
parents can allow or deny
what their kids have access to.
And they can even see
how much time
kids are spending
on certain apps.
[ Laughter ]
Let's say
little 8?year?old Mark here
is spending a little
too much time on his Tanoshi.
Well, great news.
His mom can even
pause the device,
all from her smartphone.
Tanoshi provides peace of mind
for busy, busy parents,
knowing that their kid
is safer online.
Now, Sharks, our sales
are on the rise,
and we are ready to
blast to the moon.
So, tell us, who wants to
ride the rocket ship with...
Together: Tanoshi?
Nice job, guys.
Nice job.
Thank you.
It was a good one.
Guys, why wouldn't the iPad
put you to zero?
That's a great question.
We are less than half
the price of an iPad.
We are $199, all?in.
That's a good price.
It includes
the parental controls,
all the apps, everything ??
the device ??
everything out of the box,
ready to go.
?This is cool.
?Thank you.
So, you sell it for $199.
What's your cost?
So, our landed cost, all?in,
is close to $120.
$120? Oh, that's not
a lot of margin.
Electronics don't usually have
high margins, correct?
Yes, correct.
Yeah. Okay.
Computers in
the consumer electronics space
in retail today are usually
actually single?digit margins.
Cuban: Right.
So we're actually
much stronger.
They're trying to sell
much larger volumes, too, right?
You're kind of
a niche market for kids.
Yeah.
So it's a harder sell.
But either way,
tell us about your sales,
where you're selling them,
and how it's going.
Okay, sure.
So, we've been on the market
for about a year and a half.
We've actually
already sold out
three times
in that first year and a half.
And what kind of volume?
Today, we have
$720,000 in sales.
Cuban: Okay.
I've been in consumer
electronics space for 15 years.
I started as a consultant,
and I actually helped some
pretty big?name companies ??
for example,
Dell, HP, Intel ??
grow their retail sales.
I went to Toshiba.
Over there, I inherited
a half?a?million?dollar?a?year
retail accessory business.
Within two years,
I grew that to $20 million.
So I skyrocketed that.
Wow.
I really enjoyed
doing that,
but I wanted to
own the product myself.
I wanted to be more
than a consultant.
I saw what was happening in
the little toddler tablet space.
It was just skyrocketing.
And it still is today.
And then we started
looking at
what's going on
in the education space,
and the really
"aha" moment for me
came from my mom
and my sister,
who teach in low?income
neighborhood schools.
And what they told me was,
in third grade then,
you started taking
national standardized tests
on a computer,
and some kids
were actually struggling.
They didn't know where
the keys were on the keyboard.
And I said,
"This is terrible.
Just because
you're low?income,
you shouldn't be put into
a less class,
a less track
for the rest of your life."
So we came out and said,
"We need to make
an affordable solution
that anyone can use."
John: Doesn't look like
you're gonna have a hard time.
I think
the product is genius.
Thank you.
Why are you here?
We need to raise capital.
As I mentioned earlier,
we've sold out three times.
Each time ??
You absolutely don't,
because you know every maker,
and this is a clear, easy path
to licensing.
Cuban:
You can't license this.
License?
It's an integration play.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Mark's spot?on.
Yeah.
We're an integrator.
So, what we do
as a company ??
We're actually not even
a hardware company.
I'll be honest with you.
We're a software company.
What we do is we build
some customized software.
So, what customized software
did you build?
So, on this, we actually
don't have any of
our own software yet.
'Cause I didn't see any.
Yeah.
No. No, no.
And, again, it comes back to,
unfortunately,
the whole capital play.
Guys, look, you are in
the most competitive,
difficult space that there is.
You're competing against
some of the biggest companies ??
in particular, Apple.
You know? And Samsung.
So, so ??
And I 100% agree with you.
But keep in mind, I worked
for two of those companies.
Doesn't matter.
But the reason I didn't go
back to work for another one
is they're just building
commoditized products.
One question I always ask myself
when I part with my capital is
"How does it come home to Daddy?
How do I get it back?"
This goes all the way
back to Mark's point earlier
about these other
consumer electronic companies.
So, I've been around
long enough
to watch how other companies
get acquired.
It's a very difficult
market.
Selling 2,000, 5,000,
10,000 units on Amazon ??
yes, I think you can.
But I think you need to
either reduce your costs
significantly
or raise your prices
at least 100 bucks a pop,
because you're not gonna be
100,000 to 200,000 units, right?
That's a challenge.
And so
for those reasons, guys,
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Brad, I <i>hate</i> the hardware space
you're in.
PC commodity business ??
brutal.
You need capital to buy
razor?thin margin product,
which I hate a lot.
I spent 15 years of my career
selling 6? to 12?year?olds.
The other thing
you're missing here
is customer acquisition costs.
Getting those kids
at the right time is hard ??
very hard.
Yes.
It <i>is</i> difficult.
They have no credit cards,
those kids.
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
Their parents do.
Johnston:
That is correct,
and so one thing
we're actually doing
and a big mission of us
is actually to move
more of our traffic
to buy off our website
so that when their parents buy
with their credit cards...
It makes so much sense to me
that you would approach ??
...we can go sell them
additional software.
...you would approach
a large manufacturer
and license the whole thing
to them,
because you can make it happen
and take away the curse
of dealing with inventory
on thin?margin hardware.
I'm out.
Have you put
your own money in this
or you have outside investors
now or...?
It's basically
my life savings ?? $150,000.
I invested as much
as I possibly could into it.
Thankfully, I have
a very supportive wife.
Wow.
So, Brad, you're driven by
a bit of a social mission,
'cause you're all?in,
right?
Yes. 100% in. 110%.
With any additional money
invested?
We've raised another $185,000
from friends and family,
and we've also borrowed a couple
hundred thousand dollars
to get the first
productions going.
[ Groans ]
Wojcicki:
I think it's an amazing mission.
I realize how difficult it is
to actually get
these types of things to kids.
Mm?hmm.
I think it's a challenge.
I'm out.
You know, sometimes,
with certain things
where it's so competitive,
it's better to license.
And you could maybe even
sell yourself on the side.
A lot of people
think licensing means
you're giving
everything away.
It doesn't have to be.
You could do your own selling
under your own label
and then also license
to other people.
For me, I don't think
this is the right business.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Daymond is Brad, Lisa,
and Gregory's last chance
for a deal for their affordable
laptop for kids, Tanoshi.
John:
Okay, so, we're already talking
about why licensing
should be great,
and I think that, you know,
maybe you're only thinking
"Dell, Samsung, Apple,"
right?
But what I'm thinking is,
you never go
to number 1 and 2 operators
to do a deal with you.
You go to number 30
that <i>wants</i> to be number 1 and 2.
So, I would do
a deal with you.
I'd give you the $500,000.
It would be contingent
that we get a license.
I'd walk in the door with you.
We'd call everybody we can.
But I would do it for 20%.
Okay.
So, with that, would you be okay
if we continue with our brand?
Absolutely.
In addition
to the license.
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
You cannot say no to that.
You cannot say no to that.
O'Leary:
You got to take that deal.
Brad?a?tola,
take that deal.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner:
[ Laughing ] What?
Brings our valuation down
quite a bit.
No, it brings your <i>business</i>
quite up a bit.
Brad?a?tola?
It brings your upside
up a lot higher.
Brad, imagine if you were
unshackled from hardware
how fantastic
this pitch would be.
And then you'd be uncoupled
from this total commodity.
Can we ??
Can we take a moment?
[ Whispering ] So, that's
one thing that we asked for.
Gonna educate some kids.
Love: This is great!
Congratulations, guys.
Good luck, you guys.
?Thank you.
?Thank you all very much.
?Congrats, guys.
?Good luck.
Johnston: So, now that we got
Daymond on board,
we're gonna be able to
scale so much quicker.
We're really gonna be able to
do what our mission is ??
to make learning
fun for every child.
And, again, that's why
we named our company...
Together: Tanoshi!
I love to get in early
in companies.
This is the opportunity to get
in early before we get there.
So...
Let's see how they're doing now.
What I love about
Restore is it's taken
all of the best science
and technology
and research about sleep
and helps you wake up feeling
as refreshed as you ever have.
Hey!
Hi.
I'm here to present
you guys
with <i>USA TODAY's reviewed.com</i>
CES Editors' Choice Award.
[ Laughs ]
So here you go.
Alright!
Wait. No way.
Congratulations.
Yeah. Absolutely.
To win an award
as one of the top 10
products at CES,
I mean, that was
a legit surprise today.
I forgot to mention one thing
that you would love.
I've been taking anger
management, so...
[ Laughter ]
I forgot to mention one thing
you would love.
We also have a licensing
agreement for $3.5 million.
$3.5 million?
That's right,
to use our technology.
They want us to create an
adjacent category database
in the baby?care space.
That's interesting.
If you really have something
proprietary with data
that you can sell other large
players in the skin space
and you can get
$3.5 million license deals,
Mr. Wonderful is your man.
But this business,
the chance that you will get
share in this space is so small.
It is so competitive, they will
crush you like cockroaches.
So, I'd love to show you
how ABii works,
if you're ready to
see it in action.
Great.
Roll it.
[ <i>Upbeat music plays</i> ]
So, obviously, that's
an abbreviated lesson,
but I wanted to show you
at least
how the screen
and the robot
actually interact together,
presenting
important information.
So, are you already
selling this?
These are the first three
commercial versions
that we have hot off
the manufacturing press.
We do have some presales.
We have about $140,000
in presales
as of the last three months.
Is it a Kickstarter?
No, actually,
through e?mails,
cold e?mails, word of mouth,
and basically a grant that we
got from the Department of Ed
that is allowing us
to have 20 to 25 schools
across the state of
South Carolina with robots.
I spent nine years
in this space,
in math and reading scores,
with Reader Rabbit
at The Learning Company ??
"Carmen Sandiego,"
"Oregon Trail."
Advancing math scores
is a big deal.
Do you have any data that shows
you've advanced math scores
in testing for kids?
Yes. Actually, we did
an alpha pilot last year
with about 220 students.
And so we had
67% of the students
actually improve
their math proficiency
on two math skills
during that pilot.
I had a love for education,
I had a love for technology,
so I got a PhD in
computer science
and engineering.
With what focus?
With robotics,
social?robotics focus.
Is your plan for ABii to only
sell into the school system,
or is this going to be
a consumer product
for parents to buy?
So, yes to both ??
first with the school systems,
with the after?school programs
and then eventually for
the direct?to?consumer sales.
What does ABii cost?
The commercial version of
ABii is $999 for schools.
?$999?
?Wow.
?$999 for schools.
?Yeah.
?Oh, my goodness!
?Wow.
Yes, but it comes with
all the curriculum ??
third, fourth, and fifth grade.
It's only $599 for home use.
What does it cost
to make an ABii?
$250, delivered.
Wow, that's expensive!
Yeah, ooh.
Yeah.
I think sometimes,
with something like this,
it gets very complicated.
What are your top three
selling features?
ABii accelerates learning
for students
that have difficulty with
attention.
Accelerates learning.
What's number two?
Number two is it
breaks down barriers.
So, a lot of students
have confidence issues
in the classroom
when they are asked a question
and they don't understand.
They're afraid to speak up.
So, what was number three?
Parents tell us that
they have trouble
motivating their students
to do math homework,
and when they sit down
with ABii,
they feel like there is
a sentient little robot
that is paying
attention to them,
that is part of their
learning journey.
So, I get that. Alright.
I take you at your word
that it works,
but it's so brand?new.
I'm not really sure how
you're going to be received
or what your
competition is,
because I know there
are others out there.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Let me just jump in.
So, I love the education space,
but, for me, with 220 students
who have used it so far
and with the competitive space,
you know,
there's so many companies
that are out there right now
trying to bridge ??
Who is doing this?
There's a lot just on the iPad,
you know, or on your computer.
I feel like it's pretty early.
I'm out.
Okay. Sorry to hear that.
It took me nine years
to get "Oregon Trail"
into 70% of the schools.
And there hasn't been
a successful company
to play
an educational product
that advances test scores
in consumer and school
since The Learning Company.
There's never been
another one
because these markets
are so different now.
Let me just throw in one
more thing and interject.
I understand the sales cycle.
I'm a fighter, you know?
No, I get it. I get it.
I was a stay?at?home mom
with three kids
before I decided to go back and
get my PhD in computer science.
This is the tip of the iceberg
you see here.
We've got already schools
signed up galore.
They want the empirical data.
We've got Boys &amp; Girls Clubs
signed up,
already purchased their robots
so they can participate
in the study.
This is not something
that you see with apps.
It's ?? It's more ??
It doesn't happen.
that segregates you
from anybody
who can possibly consider
getting into this space?
So, when you sit down
and ABii recognizes
where you left off
and understands you
and knows that you like,
as a third grader,
a wiggle break
and not a stretch break,
for example,
and the robot,
every time you log into it,
knows more about you,
you establish
a social connection
that is really powerful.
