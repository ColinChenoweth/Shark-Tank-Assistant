Hi, Sharks.
My name is Laura Boccanfuso.
I'm from
Columbia, South Carolina,
and I'm asking for
a $300,000 investment
for a 10% stake in my company,
Van Robotics.
Sharks, times have changed
when it comes to the way
students learn.
Kids have basically grown up
around technology,
and they definitely don't
just rely on textbooks
to help them
with school anymore.
The fact is, kids expect more.
Attention spans are shorter,
and by the time they graduate
from 12th grade,
U.S. students, only 25% of them
test proficient in math.
Yikes!
The need has never been greater
to find new and improved ways
to help students learn
and retain information.
So, a few years ago, I decided
to take my experience
helping kids by building tech
to create ABii,
the smart robot tutor.
[ Laughs ]
Boccanfuso: ABii delights kids
with fun social interactions
that keeps them engaged
and builds confidence
through every lesson.
Laura, what's your background?
Are you a teacher? Are you ??
I'm not a teacher.
Cuban: Laura.
Thank you, Lori.
If my fourth grader is sitting
right in front of it
and it's interacting,
following the courseware,
what data and how is it
collecting that data?
We're collecting correct
and incorrect answers.
Laura, it's more that
"Do I want to go back
to those days?"
We did $850 million
in consumer
and 80 in the schools,
and I spent 90% of my day
worrying about
the school business.
It's brutal.
Sure.
It's brutal.
And I just ??
I can't go back.
It's a segue.
I can't go back.
It's a segue.
It's like going back
to Hell for me.
So...
[ Laughs ]
When did you ever leave?
I can't do it.
I'm out. I'm out.
I'm out.
I'm in
the curriculum space.
I have a digital curriculum,
interactive.
When I tried to sell it
to the schools,
they couldn't care less,
because they already have
their systems,
and to echo what
Kevin's saying, it's brutal.
It takes
just such a long time.
And you want to do
two different things.
And I believe in
what you're doing.
I just don't want to take that
long ride with you, so I'm out.
Look,
I disagree with Kevin.
If you have a better mousetrap
that is so phenomenally better,
right, people will beat a path
down to your door.
Sure.
But you haven't shown me
something that's gonna say
"When I walk in the door
and put my name on ABii,
people are gonna say 'Wow.'"
What is it that
you have or will have
Yeah, see, I just ??
that's not enough, Laura.
That's not enough.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
?Good luck, Laura.
?Thank you, Laura.
?Good luck.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
Good luck, Laura.
Boccanfuso: Kevin's feedback
about it being
a very long road,
I agree with 100%.
We need some disruptive
technology
to change the future
for our students.
They're worth it,
and I'll put in the time.
If it's 9 years,
if it's 19 years, I'm in.
