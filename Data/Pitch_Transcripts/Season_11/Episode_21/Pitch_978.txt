Hi. I'm Becca.
And this is my daughter,
Eve.
Hi, Sharks!
[ Laughter ]
And this is my mom.
Hi. I'm Barb.
I'm the grandma.
And we're all
from Houston, Texas.
We are here seeking $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company,
UnbuckleMe,
a small product that's making
a big difference for families.
Eve, do you want to
go get some ice cream?
Yes!
Okay!
I'm gonna get in the car.
[ Chuckles ]
When that little girl
was born,
my mom offered
to help me with childcare,
which was so helpful to me
as a working mom.
But there was a problem.
Okay, we're here.
Let's get you out.
Unbuckle me! Unbuckle me!
Honey, honey, I'm trying.
I'm trying.
Ohh, this arthritis in my thumb,
it's hard.
She could not unbuckle
my daughter's car seat.
Turns out child car seat
buckles
require 9 pounds
of pressure to release.
It was not safe
for her to take my daughter
out in the car,
but I needed her help.
I don't know
what I'm gonna do!
Try this!
It's called UnbuckleMe.
You just slide it
around the buckle...
position the peg over
the red button...
and pinch the ends together.
Whoo?hoo! You're free.
That was easy.
Hop out.
[ Laughs ]
Let's get some ice cream.
[ Chuckles ]
There you go.
[ Laughter ]
Is it good?
UnbuckleMe
is a patented tool
that uses a type?2 lever
to reduce the force
to unbuckle a child's car seat
by more than 50%.
It's a simple machine.
It does not attach to
the car seat for safety
and should be kept out of reach
of kids when not in use.
UnbuckleMe gives me
the confidence
to know I can always
safely buckle my granddaughter.
Who wants to help us make
traveling with kids in car seats
easier and safer?
We have some samples
to show you how it works,
but first,
we'll say bye to Eve.
?Bye, Eve.
?Bye, Eve!
?Bye!
?Bye!
?Eat your ice cream.
So, all of you have a sample
of the buckle
that is most commonly used
on car seats today,
and you have a sample
of UnbuckleMe.
First, we're just gonna try it
without our product.
You start by putting
your hand underneath it
and then pushing, 'cause
if you had a child in there,
you wouldn't want to
push on the child.
What I want you to do is see
that it is difficult
and that it does take
9 pounds.
Or if you have nails,
that's a problem.
Davison: Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Well, see, exactly.
We'll get to that.
So, you slide the white part
underneath the bottom
of the buckle.
How far do you slide in?
You slide it
so that the post is centered
in the center
of the red button.
Then use the other hand
and put a couple fingers
underneath the white part,
press down
on the end of the black
so that you're
using leverage...
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
...and pull down forward.
That's night?and?day
different.
Isn't it?
What percentage of the people
that, you know,
have car seats
actually need to use this?
'Cause this isn't
a problem for everybody.
Correct.
Well, so, I'll tell you.
About half of our sales
come from grandparents.
There are 70 million
grandparents in the U. S.
My mom's an occupational
hand therapist,
so she can give you
some statistics
that a third of women
in their 50s and 60s
have arthritis.
What I'm trying to get
is size of market.
Because, A, you have to have
a child that's in a car seat.
That's right.
B, you have to have issues
with 9 pounds of pressure
on a red button.
So, let me ??
So, smaller market,
smaller market,
smaller market.
Totally follow you.
So, there's 12 million car seats
sold every year.
So, grandparents is about
half of our sales,
but let me tell you
why the market gets bigger.
30% to 40% of our sales
are actually
to younger families
who are buying this
for what we call
the "school drop?off
line scenario."
They're actually handing it
to the second or the third row
to a 4? or a 5?year?old
to unbuckle ??
they can unbuckle
themselves,
hand it back to Mom or Dad
in the front seat,
keep it out of reach.
Carpool line moves faster.
They don't have to get out of
the car, they don't have to
break their shoulder
trying to reach to the kid.
It's stressful being
in a carpool line.
Interesting.
The challenge ??
the unfortunate consequence,
perhaps, is that
they're moving them
into booster seats
too early,
and I'm a child passenger
safety technician,
so I am all involved.
So that's your background.
You're a child passenger
safety technician?
We're the perfect
team, Mark.
The dream team!
[ Chuckles ]
Becca, $100,000 for 10%...
Yes.
...imputes it's worth
a million smackeroos.
That's correct.
Now, why is it worth
a million smackeroos?
So, let me tell you about
some of our numbers, Kevin,
'cause I know that's
what you want to hear.
I'm ready, Becca.
Alright.
Bring it on.
Been on the market
for 22 months.
We've sold
over 35,000 units.
Our total sales
are $400,000.
How much do you
sell them for?
We sell them for $14.99.
$14.99. Okay.
That's right.
And what do you make them for?
$1.80. We currently
manufacture in the U. S.
John: Nice.
And how are you
acquiring customers?
So, we are relying largely on
Facebook ads and on Amazon ads.
We're spending about $3
to acquire a customer.
We think we can get even lower,
closer to 2.
Does this have a patent,
or can I ??
We do.
We have two patents.
Issued?
We have a utility and ??
Issued.
An issued utility
and design patent.
You have answers, Becca,
I must say.
I have all the answers,
Kevin.
Yeah, I'm impressed.
You guys are the American
dream team, right?
We are.
You're exactly why people
watch this show,
because they want
to have that idea,
they want to come on
and be on that carpet
with 22 months of sales.
Hey, thanks!
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
It's awesome.
I thought it was gonna be
frivolous and pointless,
but I am wrong, and you have
convinced me of that.
Kevin, that's the highest
compliment.
So I'll make it easy on you.
What you need is
great social media
to reduce your
customer?acquisition cost.
Absolutely.
I've got a killer team that
does that, just killer.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
So...
Yeah.
I'm gonna give you
the $100,000.
I want a dollar
royalty on it.
But I'm not greedy
for the equity,
but I want what we call
"schmuck insurance."
So I'll do it for 7% equity.
Okay.
Alright?
A little discount there of 30%.
Lower.
Yeah. Little lower.
And I'll get a dollar a unit,
and my team goes nuts to get
your customer acquisition down.
?How long's the dollar royalty?
?For how long? Yeah.
?In perpetuity?
?It's forever, yeah.
In perpetuity, you have
to pay him a dollar...
Cuban: Perpetuity?!
for the rest of your life.
The word that you never
want to hear from Kevin.
Perpetuity.
If these Sharks want to make
a counteroffer, they can,
but you now have
a bona fide offer
from the only Mr. Wonderful
you're ever gonna meet.
and Becca and Barb have
an offer from Kevin
for their car seat buckle
opening tool, UnbuckleMe.
I'm gonna give you the $100,000.
I'll do it for 7% equity.
Okay.
And I'll get a dollar a unit,
and my team goes nuts to get
your customer acquisition down.
How long's
the dollar royalty?
For how long? Yeah.
In perpetuity?
It's forever, yeah.
You now have a bona fide offer
from the only Mr. Wonderful
you're ever gonna meet.
I have to say, I'm pretty
impressed with you,
like, both of you,
and I can relate.
Davison: Thank you.
I do a lot of things
with my mom and my kids,
It doesn't solve the problem
of the royalty.
Davison: It doesn't
solve the problem.
I may be giving you, Kevin,
100% of my profit in perpetuity.
Alright, alright. Listen.
Do you ??
A fixed?dollar amount.
I really can't.
Stop your whining.
Here's what we'll do.
After we recoup
our 100K back,
we'll drop the royalty
down to 50 cents.
[ Laughs ]
So, here's another
path for you, Kevin.
And let me tell you how you're
gonna get your money back.
How?
By the end
of this year,
we'll be 85% growth
over last year.
We're growing
5% month to month.
What are your projections
right now for the next year?
Year?to?date, $200,000.
By the end of the year,
we'll easily do $300,000.
We're cash?flow positive,
as well.
I haven't even
mentioned that.
Okay, so we heard your feedback.
You don't want the perpetual.
But I think it is important for
us to recoup at least 100K,
so we'd want to keep it
at 50 cents.
And ?? And up ??
Yeah, but I want more
than 100K back.
No, 100%.
We keep it at 50 cents.
We want to get $250,000 back.
And then we want
the 10% equity,
so it'd be 5% each.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: So you're raising how
much money you'd give them.
Royalty goes away.
The royalty goes away
at $250,000.
But think about this.
So, here ?? [ Sighs ]
O'Leary: Can you imagine
the power we have together
in terms of social?
Are you kidding?
[ Whispering
indistinctly ]
It's great.
It's phenomenal, I'm sure.
We have a tremendous
amount to learn
from you Sharks on that.
It would be a lot of fun.
And I have to say, like,
I would lo??
...will get you
where you need to go.
Let's see where your head's
at now, Becca.
And we're partnering ??
Well, you're getting
two Sharks.
Giving up a lot.
You're getting two Sharks.
I'll give you the $100,000
for 15%, no royalty.
This is amazing.
Heilman: Ooh.
We never anticipated this.
This is wo??
That's a phenomenal
offer.
It's a lot of equity
to give up.
So now you have
three offers
that you have
to decide on.
Yeah.
Would you split 15%
and we'll call it a deal?
Nope.
'Cause we're worth...
We're worth it, baby.
Wow, that's such greed.
Deal.
Deal!
Aah! Whoo! [ Laughs ]
?Welcome to the Shark Tank.
?Boom.
Ohh!
[ Laughter ]
Becca,
it's over between us.
[ Laughs ]
Maybe I'll come back
with my next product.
I don't think so.
[ Laughter ]
Davison: We're so excited
with Mark and Lori.
We think they understand
our product,
they respect us
as entrepreneurs
and everything
we've accomplished so far.
They're ready to
jump on our team.
We are so excited to
have them on our team!
[ Laughs ]
