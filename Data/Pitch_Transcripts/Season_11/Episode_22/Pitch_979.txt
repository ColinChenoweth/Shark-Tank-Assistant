Cuban: I love a good crochet.
Thanks, Schuyler.
How's that look?
[ Laughter ]
What do you think,
Schuyler?
Oh! Beautiful!
[ Laughs ]
Mark, yours are
a little low?waisted.
Know how to do
a booty shake, Robert?
How did you get
those pants on?
O'Leary: So, Schuyler, tell us
about how you got into this.
Schuyler, what
do you sell them for?
So, the things that have been
manufactured are these parasols.
But, Schuyler,
if I'm gonna give you $100,000,
that's like
10 years of sales for you.
It's crazy.
You have to have a plan
to blow this thing up.
I want to hear
the plan.
The plan is to take
the pieces that I like the best
Schuyler, being a great artist
is not enough.
$37,000 is
really insignificant.
It's a start.
It's a start.
But for me
to give you $100,000,
you got to get this
to half a million.
You got to get
to $1 million.
John: Schuyler, I think
we've all pretty much agreed
in the same way.
I mean, you remind me
very much of myself.
Schuyler, you had
all the components
that you need
on "Shark Tank" ??
a brilliant idea,
the face of it.
Missing is
a person telling me,
"Look, Schuyler's
doing all this.
Meanwhile, I'm back in India.
I've got logistics.
I've got distribution.
I'm dealing with the retailers
we're gonna work with."
You need that partner,
whoever it is.
They're not there.
I would love to give you
$100,000.
I would love
to give you more.
I mean, this thing ??
Greiner: Do it.
You can.
Do it. Do it.
I'm not going to,
because it's un?investable.
?Do it.
?Do it.
?It's un?investable.
[ Chanting "Do it" ]
That's my guy over there.
That's my guy, in the corner.
?Thank you, guys. Thank you.
?Do it! Do it!
O'Leary: But there's ??
?Congrats, Schuyler. Congrats.
?Go in peace.
Your words mean a lot to me.
They really do.
Alright, come on, guys.
Let's boogie on out of here.
?Boogie on.
?Thanks, guys.

Ellers: The piece of advice
that I took away from that
was that I am selling myself
too cheap
