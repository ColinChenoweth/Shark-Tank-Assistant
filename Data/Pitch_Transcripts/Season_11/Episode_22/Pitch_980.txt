My name is Schuyler Ellers,
and I'm the creator
of one of the hottest
fashion trends on the Internet.
I'm seeking $100,000 in exchange
for 10% of my company.
Sharks, crochet takes us
back to a time
when life was simpler
and everything was groovy.
[ Chuckles ]
But most importantly,
crochet promotes positive vibes
and makes people happy.
And that's why
I created my company ??
Lord Von Schmitt.
My crochet designs
are colorful, sustainable,
recycled, and repurposed.
But why take it from me, when
you can see for yourselves?
Hit it!
[ Up?tempo music plays ]
Uriel and Deanna's outfits
are aligned
with a slow fashion movement
and come with two
fabulous accessories ??
lower carbon footprints
and reduced waste.
Whoo!
Cuban: I love a good crochet.
Thanks, Schuyler.
How's that look?
[ Laughter ]
What do you think,
Schuyler?
Oh! Beautiful!
[ Laughs ]
Mark, yours are
a little low?waisted.
Know how to do
a booty shake, Robert?
How did you get
those pants on?
O'Leary: So, Schuyler, tell us
about how you got into this.
This looks like a handmade art,
in some ways.
This is a handmade art,
which I create.
entirely from
recycled crocheted blankets.
If you're making them by hand,
how can you produce in quantity?
Those are created
based on my crochet designs,
and they are created
in Asia.
You outsource it.
I outsource it.
So you have a factory
that's making them for you.
Yeah.
Schuyler, what
do you sell them for?
So, the things that have been
manufactured are these parasols.
And how much is
a parasol?
To get a parasol to
the United States costs me $30,
and I sell them for $128
on my website.
Wow!
O'Leary: So, you have to
get word out
so people know about this,
'cause we didn't know about this
on "Shark Tank" ?? never heard
of Lord Von Schmitt.
So, Lord Von Schmitt started
as my own weird little project,
until suddenly it got picked up
on the Internet.
And all of those blogs
ultimately culminated
in a major publicity boom
that sold a ton of things.
And mostly,
it was men's shorts
made from recycled
Afghan blankets.
How much are
the short shorts?
Short shorts are $58.
And the entire suit?
What about the long ones
beside it?
And then, the entire suit,
I can get $300.
Wow.
You wearing those
right now?
As a matter of fact, I am.
?Bang!
?[ Laughs ]
Now, you seem like
you're definitely
a fascinating
and interesting person.
You have all our attention.
What's your background?
So, I studied visual arts
at Columbia University.
Nice.
I was an English teacher
for years,
and I lived in Barcelona.
So, from there, I got into
knitting and crochet ??
just typical,
what everybody does.
[ Laughter ]
When I came back
from Barcelona,
I saw Afghan blankets
in the thrift store.
America has a ton of Afghans.
We have a glut of Afghans.
So I created these, and I put
them up on my Etsy shop.
Greiner: Yeah.
Okay.
And then I took
a little trip to India.
All of a sudden,
I saw this bizarre spike
in men's shorts,
which I hadn't sold
a ton of prior to that.
And by the time I had
300 open orders for shorts,
I had to leave India
and go back to the United States
to make them.
I went to thrift store
after thrift store ??
Cut them up,
sewed them together.
Cut them up,
sewed them together.
Shorts.
How many orders did you get
on the shorts total?
Total? More than 300.
325.
Okay.
So, who's buying these?
Like, what is your demographic?
Me. Guys like me.
My demographic
is a lot of people
who go
to summer festivals.
There's a very large
LGBTQIA+ contingent
that follows this fashion.
Are you making any money today?
What are your sales?
My sales are $188,000.
?Wow!
?So far this year?
?When did you start?
?For four years.
For four years?
Yes.
What about last year?
Last year was $37,000.
Okay, so, it's a small
kind of hobby.
It's not your full?time job.
Is this your full?time job?
It <i>is</i> my full?time job.
I live on that.
It is?
You're starving
to death.
?That's nothing.
?That's why you're so skinny.
Oh, I can stretch money
really far. [ Chuckles ]
But, Schuyler,
if I'm gonna give you $100,000,
that's like
10 years of sales for you.
It's crazy.
You have to have a plan
to blow this thing up.
I want to hear
the plan.
The plan is to take
the pieces that I like the best
and especially something
like this thong,
which can be produced
very cheaply ??
How many have you sold
of the thong?
Of the thongs?
10.
But I came out with them
this summer.
But wait.
These are basically
works of art
where you put your heart
and soul into it, right?
They are.
So why not charge more?
A lot of times,
when people see something
and it costs
more than they expect,
how they value it
goes way up.
How's he gonna make
a living, though?
You need to be able to make
a living off of this.
He really has to do it
in mass, Mark, because ??
No.
No!
But he can't
get there, Lori.
How is he gonna
make money off ??
The only way
this works is
if you sell that jumpsuit
for $1,000 or more.
And I can.
You should have no pieces
that cost less than $250.
If you're charging 60 bucks,
80 bucks,
it's just a piece
of clothing.
Be an artist.
Sell it as artwork.
You handmake each
and every one of these things.
It's a piece of art.
Sell it that way.
Oh, I agree. For my handmade
work, I totally agree.
You're still
not charging enough.
You don't have to sell a ton
of these when they're art.
You only
have to sell seven.
What are you doing,
Mark?
I'm out, but I think it's
a great opportunity for you.
But you just got to be an artist
that's proud of their work
and has some confidence that
it'll sell for a huge price.
Schuyler, being a great artist
is not enough.
$37,000 is
really insignificant.
It's a start.
It's a start.
But for me
to give you $100,000,
you got to get this
to half a million.
You got to get
to $1 million.
And that is less art
and creative.
That's art and business.
There's no plan.
I'm out. I'm sorry.
Greiner:
As much as I love all of this,
I want to put
my heart and soul into it
and give the very best
that I can.
And, unfortunately, here,
I just don't think that this is,
like, right for me.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
John: Schuyler, I think
we've all pretty much agreed
in the same way.
I mean, you remind me
very much of myself.
I stood on a corner
and I sold $800 worth of hats,
and I realized
at that point,
"I will never work
for anybody, ever again
for the rest of my life."
But it took me 10 years
to figure it out from that day.
I just don't think
you have it figured out yet,
but you will never work
for anybody
for the rest of your life.
But right now, it's too early.
I'm out.
Schuyler, you had
all the components
that you need
on "Shark Tank" ??
a brilliant idea,
the face of it.
Missing is
a person telling me,
"Look, Schuyler's
doing all this.
Meanwhile, I'm back in India.
I've got logistics.
I've got distribution.
I'm dealing with the retailers
we're gonna work with."
You need that partner,
whoever it is.
They're not there.
I would love to give you
$100,000.
I would love
to give you more.
I mean, this thing ??
Greiner: Do it.
You can.
Do it. Do it.
I'm not going to,
because it's un?investable.
?Do it.
?Do it.
?It's un?investable.
[ Chanting "Do it" ]
That's my guy over there.
That's my guy, in the corner.
?Thank you, guys. Thank you.
?Do it! Do it!
O'Leary: But there's ??
You know, I am an investor,
and I got to get it back.
I'm just frustrated,
and I'm sorry to say I'm out,
but you're one hell of a guy,
Lord Von Schmitt.
?Thanks, guys.
?Go in peace.
?Congrats, Schuyler. Congrats.
?Go in peace.
Your words mean a lot to me.
They really do.
Alright, come on, guys.
Let's boogie on out of here.
?Boogie on.
?Thanks, guys.
[ Laughter ]
Ellers: The piece of advice
that I took away from that
was that I am selling myself
too cheap
and that if I'm an artist
and I have this charisma,
then I need to sell myself
for more.
And that was great
to hear it from them.
That gave me the power
to do it myself.
