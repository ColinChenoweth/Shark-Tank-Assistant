The challenge
you have today is,
you're young, you're cool,
you're hip,
but the macro trend is,
guys aren't wearing ties.
I'm glad you brought that up.
And we see it, right?
We're not naive to that.
We 100% see that.
But, again, the goal here is
to build this
into more than just
a tie company.
To what?
So, what else are you thinking
of doing besides socks?
So, the name of the company is
actually Tough Apparel.
Tough Tie is
our staple product.
Currently, we do ties,
belts, and socks,
is our current
product lineup.
Look, to me, building a brand is
about execution.
Sure.
It's about
a great product.
And here you guys
come walking in,
and I get what
you're <i>trying</i> to accomplish,
but there's a lot
of polyester ties out there.
Maybe yours is just better,
better, better,
but it's not obvious
from looking at it.
Sure.
I just don't see the vision
coming to fruition.
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you, Mark.
We appreciate it.
I'm kind of on the fence with
this thing 'cause, normally,
I wouldn't want to go in that
business, but, you know,
listen, I did the deal
with the Bombas socks guys,
and I said, "Eh,
this is never gonna work."
I couldn't be more
wrong or inaccurate.
Because they kind of
remind me of you.
You kind of know your target,
and, you know,
you're positioning it
in a different way.
But in that deal, you know,
it was really appealing
to so many different people
for so many reasons ??
females, males,
and everybody still needs
to wear socks
most of the time.
Sure.
I just think this is just
too tight of a segment for me.
I'm just ?? I'm out.
Okay. Thank you, Daymond.
We appreciate it.
John: There will always be
some challenge in the world,
but true entrepreneurs
and survivors know
how to adjust
and become stronger,
and that is what makes us
unstoppable.
When we come out of this,
know we will be more united
than ever.
Cuban: And when we get
to the other side,
when we get to America 2.0,
we can and will make it
a better place.
The challenge is,
as you know,
there's just not one accelerant
that you can put on it, right?
It's hard. There's not,
like, some advertising routine
or some big marketing program
that you can do
that all of a sudden,
it's gonna blow it up, you know?
I just don't know
how I would scale it.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Really?
Really.
Hi, Sharks.
We're the Halls.
I'm Colt.
And I'm Stacy.
We live in Exeter, Missouri,
and we're seeking $50,000
in exchange for 15%
of our company, Potty Safe.
Sharks, we all know parenthood
is full of rewarding
and trying times.
And one of those
most trying times is...
Schew?whee!
Potty training.
That's right, Sharks,
when potty?training
our little ones,
we turn to the potty chair
to teach them
the dos and the don'ts.
But what happens
when your little ones
become overachievers?
They either try to dump it
all by themselves...
?Oh!
?Ew!
Or, worse,
they try to wear it as a hat.
[ Laughs ]
We're the ones left cleaning up
those nasty spills
all over our kiddos,
the floor,
or wherever else they decide
to leave their mark.
That's why we decided
to create a no?mess,
less?stress approach
to potty training.
Have no fear!
Potty Safe is here!
That's right, we're the first
and only potty?training chair
to feature
a child?proof latch.
Simply press in
on the child?proof latch
on each side to remove
the waste bowl from the base.
Simple as that,
and then safely discard
of those wonderful
accomplishments.
To secure it
back into position,
just snap it back down
into the base.
Now, Sharks, we all know you
have little ones in your lives.
So who's ready to eliminate
that stress?
When it comes to
all that mess with a...
Potty Safe.     Potty Safe.
[ Chuckles ]
We have some samples
for you,
but first, we'll let him
get all dried up.
[ Chuckles ]
You can have mine,
Daymond.
Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Uh?huh. And Mark.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Herjavec: Stacy, I have
16?month?old twins,
and I'm a little disturbed
by your presentation.
Yeah. And, you know, double
potty duty means double messes.
Wow.
Okay, so the child wants to take
their accomplishment
and put it in the toilet
themselves?
Yes, right,
'cause they see ??
That happens a lot?
Yes, it does.
The child sees you
dump the potty,
and they want to help
dump the potty.
And they even like to
bring it to you and be
like, "Look what I did!"
?Really?
?Yes.
What age does this happen at
besides Robert?
[ Laughter ]
Well, that's actually
how we came up with it ??
potty?training
our daughter.
She was about 18 months,
2 years.
So right at where Robert's
twins are right now.
Oh, my gosh.
I have a lot of travel
coming up.
Yes, so you definitely
need this.
So, you created this?
You came up with the concept
and the idea?
Yes, uh?huh.
I looked high and low
for a child?proof
potty?training chair,
and when I couldn't find it,
I thought,
"Okay, I'll just go buy
some supplies."
And then I handed the potty
and all those to my cowboy here,
you know, 'cause he can
fabricate anything.
What's your background?
Yeah,
what's your background?
Colt:
I just grew up on a farm.
I'm a fabricator, welder.
So, what was the process
to get from your first concept
to prototype
to this, which looks great?
Well, he fabricated it
on our kitchen island.
So we had some drills
in there going,
and we finished potty?training
our daughter with our prototype,
and we didn't have
another issue again.
Wow.
And I said, "I think we really
have something here."
So I went online,
like, tried to see if there was
a patent out there,
and when it came back,
I thought, "Okay.
We need to go
for this."
And then we found out
how much tooling was.
Yeah.
And we're like,
"That's not something
to be taken lightly."
So we ended up
getting the funding
by mortgaging our house
for it.
It's how much
we believe in it.
Together: Wow.
How big a mortgage
did you get?
We got a revolving line
of credit against our house.
How much was it?
For $140,000,
but we invested...
Hoo.
...$152,000 total.
So, why doesn't the kid
just pick up the whole thing?
That's a great question.
To you and me,
we're grown adults,
so it does seem
very lightweight.
But to a toddler, they see you
pick up only the bowl...
It's pretty heavy
for a toddler to pick up.
But for a toddler,
it's big and bulky.
What were you doing before
you had this "aha" moment?
So, I grew up on a dairy farm,
and I ended up going to college.
Where'd you go
to college?
[ Voice breaking ] Um...
It's okay.
Ohh.
So, I went to Missouri
Southern State University.
Um, my dad wanted to make sure
I went to college
to have a better chance.
[ Sniffles ]
Anyway, so, I got my degree
in accounting,
and I joined
corporate America.
And my daughter at that time
basically only wanted Daddy.
Oh.
And, um, I left
corporate America
and got, like,
just a less?stress job.
And it actually
worked out great,
'cause that was the time
we started to develop this.
And I just thought,
"You know what?
If I'm gonna work
this hard,
I might as well
work this hard for myself
and appreciate myself,"
so...
Which is great.
I hated to leave it,
but I'm like,
"That's what I spent
so many years going to school.
That's what my parents
paid for."
They came from a hard spot,
and they worked so hard.
It just gets me every time.
And they are
very proud of us.
But here you are
in the Shark Tank.
Let's focus on this product.
Okay. Yes.
What's the game plan
for world potty domination?
So, we have been actually
in talks with big?box retailers.
We had a meeting with Walmart
just in June.
Wow.
Did they like the product?
Yes, they did.
We're in touch with them.
My daughter was potty?trained
at 14 months.
What?!
Yeah.
She was potty?trained ??
So how long did it take?
It took literally,
like, a week.
That's 'cause
she's a genius.
Well, no, that's like ??
we gave her M&amp;Ms every time.
That's exactly what I did.
I gave Jake M&amp;Ms.
Right, yeah.
Exactly. So I didn't know that
this problem really existed.
I just ??
is this a big enough problem?
Yeah.
And you know what?
Maybe we can find that out
by you telling us sales or ??
Yeah, so ??
Well, before you
get into total sales,
what's your cost to make, and
what do you sell each one for?
Then tell us
your total sales.
Yeah.
We have $6.50 in each unit,
and they retail for $28.95.
And where are you
selling them now?
On our website.
Uh?huh.
And last month
we just launched on Amazon,
and it's doing really well.
What do you think
you'll do next month,
all?in, all the channels?
For the rest of the year,
we're estimating $15,000.
And what have you done
for the year so far?
So, the entire year,
we've sold $2,000,
but that's 'cause we didn't have
money to go toward marketing.
So you'll do $17,000 this year?
$17,000?
Yeah.
The sales worry me.
Because my experience
with products like this
that really fit a niche,
that mommies
or people like that love,
is they kind of go boom
a little bit.
So I'm surprised that
you're not getting more uplift.
Is it because the market for it
just isn't that big?
No, I think the market
is that big for it,
because just in
the last two months,
we've seen
such an increase in sales.
How much did you sell
last month?
Last month, we had
about $200 in sales.
And the month before that?
The same.
And there are more sales,
of course, on the way
with the retail
and the big?box stores.
Hopefully.
Yes.
I love your story,
and I love how you guys
worked this product out.
I just ?? I don't really know
anything about this space.
I just wouldn't be
of value to you, so I'm out.
Alright. Thank you.
Alright. Thank you.
Stacy, I love the ingenuity
and how practical you guys are.
And I don't want to
discourage you,
but I just think
it's small.
I'll definitely buy it,
because, apparently, I need one.
[ Laughing ] Yeah.
Or two, in my case.
Two. Two.
Yeah. I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, guys, to give you $50,000
isn't a lot of money from us.
It's a lot to you, obviously,
and it can be very impactful,
but it's hard, really,
to partner at that level.
I wish I could just say
I'm all?in,
but I can't be,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Alright. Thank you.
Thank you.
There's a huge issue here.
It's the elephant
in the room.
with Colt and Stacy's
potty?training seat, Potty Safe.
It's the elephant
in the room.
You haven't proven there's
any demand for this product.
It's a tough one.
Nobody in America wants
to see you fail with this.
Me either.
But it's not clear
what the path is.
I wish you the best.
I really do, but I'm out.
Lori?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I think you did
an amazing job of it,
but I do feel that this
is gonna be a tough journey.
I just don't feel
it's investable for me today,
and I'm sorry, but I'm out.
That's alright.
Alright, well,
thank you for your time.
Thank you, guys.
Herjavec: Yeah.
Alright.
Good luck, guys.
You can do this.
Thanks.
No, wait. You know what?
Come back.
Come back. Come back.
My Squatty Potty company ??
it was a little stool
that helps you poop.
[ Laughter ]
And everybody laughed at it.
Yeah.
But that little stool ??
we are seriously
at $160 million in sales,
I think.
Maybe I could have them
look at this ??
because we have a lot
of brand extensions ??
and see if there's something
that we can do together.
Um...
So I'll do $50,000
for...
20%.
You got a deal.
Okay. Yay!
?Good job, Lori.
?Whoo!
That is the Shark
with the heart.
Yeah.
?There you go, Lori. Good job.
?Thank you so much. Thank you.
?That's awesome.
?I am so happy for you guys.
Greiner: Alright,
we're gonna make this work.
Congrats, guys. Good job.
Oh, my gosh.
We did it!
[ Laughs ]
[ Crying ]
Oh, my God,
did that just happen?
[ Chuckling ]
Did that just happen?
My parents
are just very hardworking,
and, you know, they've been
such role models, too.
Bounced back. You know,
they had some hard times.
And to watch them work
their butts off and come back,
I just, you know,
want to make them proud.
