[ Chuckles ]
I'm Skylar Bennett.
And I'm Kevin Shoemaker.
We're from the beautiful
Mesa, Arizona,
and we're the creators
of the Tough Tie.
But more
on that later.
But first, your money ??
we need it, lots of it.
We're asking for $100,000 in
exchange for 15% of our company.
Let's be real, Sharks.
Life is messy!
But life with kids...
...is a tornado of filth!
[ Laughter ]
From spills and spit?up
to tugging and smearing,
your clothes
take a beating!
Worse than a white shirt
at a tomato festival.
Both: #DadJokes.
[ Laughs ]
And that expensive tie
you're wearing
made with loose stitching
and fragile materials
is easily snagged,
and it has to be dry?cleaned.
Both: #HighMaintenance.
But as they say...
[ Both grunt ]
...fatherhood is the mother
of invention.
Introducing...
? Ahh ?
...Tough Ties.
Designed with
real?life situations in mind
that give you
confidence!
What does that even mean?
Number one...
A 100% unique design
allowing it to be
regularly machine?washed.
And yes, this has been washed
multiple, multiple times.
That looks awesome.
Thanks.
[ Whispering ]
I know.
[ Laughter ]
[ Normal voice ]
Number two...
An iron?lock stitch.
Our ties have five times
the stitching of a normal tie.
They are
<i>never</i> coming apart.
And number three...
This is our favorite.
Every single tie we make
is 100%
stain? and liquid?repellant!
What?!
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Not to mention
the microfiber tipping
to clean your phone screen
or glasses.
[ Laughter ]
In a nutshell, Tough Ties
will endure life's mishaps,
allowing you
to always look your best.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to tie the knot with Tough Tie?
[ Chuckles ]
Great job.
Now our man?baby ??
You got some samples?
Man?baby Logan's gonna hand out
some ties.
The man?baby!
That's great.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughing ] Oh, yes!
But wait ??
there's socks!
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, that's cute.
Custom, obviously.
?Oh, yeah.
?Thank you, sir.
?Ooh! Hello.
?I notice that Mr. Wonderful is
featured on this tie ??
a very wise move.
?I love the pattern.
?Oh, yeah.
?It's really cute.
?So, all those ?? Crazy thing.
All of those were designed
and printed
and manufactured
this week.
?What?
?Really?
So, part of the feature of this
is I can do customized ties
with images on them?
Absolutely.
So, we actually handle
the printing process in?house.
So, it's called dye sublimation,
if you've heard of that.
Yes, we have.
So, we have
our own equipment in?house,
so we control
the printing.
Kevin does a lot
of the design work,
so we can turn prints around
almost immediately.
We literally ??
From design to production,
those Shark ties took
just a few days.
So, tell us the story.
You have your own machines.
You have a factory.
Yeah, what's the story
of you two? How long have
you guys been together?
Skylar and I ??
we're both ??
we're both young
working professionals.
We're both dads.
I've got three kids.
?You're a dad?
?I got three kids!
?Three kids? How old are you?
?Come on!
?29.
?Kevin, you're 29?!
Skylar's got
three kids.
?And they're not triplets?
?I'm 30.
Not triplets ??
all born separately.
Yep.
So, we ?? Our background is
commercial real estate.
We were just young hustlers
getting our career ready,
and tie ?? shirt and tie ??
that's part
of the uniform, right?
You have to look good.
You have to feel good.
You got to be the part.
What we realized very,
very quickly was that your ties
get destroyed immediately
from kids eating them
and spitting up on them.
From meeting at lunches,
you spill on your tie.
Dry cleaning
only kind of works.
And so we are trying
to solve that problem.
Are you still doing
commercial real estate?
No, we're not.
So, we left our full?time ??
This is a full?time gig?
Correct. Over two years ago,
we left our jobs.
So, are you sustaining
six kids?
Over two years ago?
Over two years ago.
Over two years ago, yeah.
This business is sustaining
two families and six kids?
So, it's getting there.
The business is
profitable, okay?
[ Chuckles ]
We're not paying ourselves
as much as we should be yet.
We have very,
very supportive wives...
?[ Chuckles ]
?...who have given up a lot.
Yeah, they have three kids
with you.
I know!
[ Laughs ]
And are they working?
They work full time.
Both wives work full time.
What are your sales today?
So, to date, we're at lifetime
sales of $450,000.
What about last year,
this year?
Last year was
$208,000.
We've already hit $200,000
this year.
We're on track for $400,000
this year.
How are you selling it?
Primarily online,
through our website.
What is it gonna cost me?
What does it cost you to make?
Great question.
So, our high?end tie,
which is
the Hustle Collection ??
The yellow?
Shoemaker: Yeah,
with the white tags on them.
That is $45 retail.
$45?
Yep.
Oy!
What's the cost
to make it?
So, we make those in
our U. S. manufacturer for $15.
?Fully loaded?
?Yes, $15 out the door.
Herjavec: Skylar,
walk us through the numbers.
What will you do this year?
We're gonna do over $400,000
this year in sales.
At that $400,000...
Yep.
...will you make money?
Yes.
Where's the major??
How much will you make?
So, we should make
roughly $40,000 in profit
on that $400,000.
Why so low?
Where's all the money going?
Right now, we're paying
for our customers, right?
Meaning?
We are just doing
paid advertising online.
We spend roughly $10,000 a month
on paid advertising.
The reason we do that is
'cause we get a 200% return.
How much of your money
is invested,
and do you have any debt?
Yeah, we started out ??
we both put in
about $43,000
of our own money...
That's combined.
...just savings,
everything like that,
to get it off the ground.
We've got about
$150,000 of debt right now.
And who
did you borrow from?
So, we sold
our houses.
Whoa!
You sold your homes
to start this business?
Both of us.
This isn't just
a start?up for us.
This is who we are.
It's what we believe in.
Skylar, every time you say
the word "brand,"
you scare
the crap out of me.
I just want you to sell
a lot of ties.
Okay.
Best way to build a brand ??
build a successful business.
Absolutely.
Yep.
I think you're both
quite brilliant.
You're extremely enjoyable.
Like, I don't think
I could adore you more.
[ Both laugh ]
I'm 100% in on you guys.
I'm just not 100% in
on the tie business.
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you, Lori.
We appreciate it.
I'm a little
more pragmatic.
How many units of ties?
How many units you sell?
Units of ties?
Yeah. Just total, you think,
just units?
Next year,
we expect to sell
between 10,000
and 13,000 units of ties.
If you do 13,000 units a year
and you're growing at,
let's say, 20%,
it's gonna take me seven years,
if I even put a royalty
of a buck a tie on it,
to get my capital back.
That's the only way
I'd do it.
I still have to wait
seven years.
It's like
[vocalizing dirge]
[ Laughter ]
That was good.
That was good.
[ Laughter continues ]
That was good.
My thing is,
I was gonna take less equity
with some path
to getting liquidity sooner.
Sure.
Robert is "build the company,"
and I appreciate that.
Plus, he's got guys
in the space,
which is
extremely helpful.
I'm gonna make this
a binary decision for you.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Well...
Let me tell you ??
you guys are great.
I mean, it's a really, really
fun vibe you have about you.
It's super fun.
I love the humor.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
in Kevin and Skylar's
durable?accessories company,
Tough Tie.
Let me tell you ??
you guys are great.
I mean, it's a really, really
fun vibe you have about you.
It's super fun.
I love the humor.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
$100,000 for 35%.
Ooh!
You got to <i>really</i> love
those guys.
We're gonna pair you
with Buttercloth.
We'll do over $3.5 million
this year.
When they came on the show
a year ago...
Right.
...I think they were doing
$100,000.
Can we just talk
for two seconds?
Two seconds ?? right here!
Don't go anywhere.
[ Both whispering ]
We would love you
as a partner.
Thank you.
And we will grind,
like ??
and will continue
to grind like crazy.
I expect you to.
We would like
to counteroffer
$100,000 for 25%
of the company.
No.
$100,000 for 35%.
?Wow. Wow.
?Ruh?roh!
That's a lot
of polyester.
[ Chuckles ]
But you know what you can do
with polyester?
You can stretch it!
We're gonna
stretch that money,
and we're gonna build
a big business.
I'm the only one that saw
the vision in you guys.
$100,000, 35%.
Let's do it.
Would you be willing
to do 1/3, 1/3, 1/3?
We're all equal partners.
Let's build this thing together.
Let's crush it.
That's not unreasonable.
Really?
Shoemaker: It was literally
a tank of Sharks.
Like, it's no joke
naming it "Shark Tank."
It was crazy!
But if Tough Ties
can survive babies spitting
and pulling
and tugging,
then Tough Ties
can survive the Tank.
Thank you so much, Kevin.
I appreciate that.
And Kevin has an issue
