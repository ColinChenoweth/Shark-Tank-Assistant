You're gonna nickel?and?dime me
for the other couple percent?
No. $100,000 for 35%.
Wow. Robert.
Greiner: Robert!
Robert, come on.
What are you doing, Robert?
33 1/3%.
My name is Nick Baker,
from Los Angeles, California,
?Here you are, sir.
?Thank you, Nick.
?Brave man. Thank you.
?[ Laughs ]
?Thanks, Nick. Good job.
?Thank you very much.
So, Nick,
were you a comedian?
Yes.
I came to Los Angeles
about nine years ago
Nick, what are you gonna do
with the $100,000?
Well, the first thing
is inventory.
Is that really
your problem?
Well, it's part of it.
Do you have orders
that you haven't filled?
No. I mean, I ??
Then why do you need
inventory?
Because I've always been
struggling with it.
So, Nick, you found
this very niche product.
I get it.
It's amazing.
I tell you, Nick,
I'm fascinated
how you have
that amount of sales,
'cause you have a customer
that literally has one week
or whatever the case is
to have this experience.
Yeah, Nick,
along the same lines,
look, what you've
accomplished is great.
Nick, I really respect
the hustle.
But the timeframe to get
that customer is so small.
There's so many other ways
to do it.
I mean, power to you that you've
actually been able to do this,
but I can't connect the dots
going forward.
I ??
I'm out.
Thank you.
But there's still Lori,
the Sharkette.
[ Chuckles ]
It's a very niche market ??
like, just so small.
I find that it would be really
difficult for it to blow up.
But on the opposite side
of this,
all it takes
is one idea, right?
Thank you, Nick.
It was a heck of a story.
?Good luck, Nick.
?Good luck to you.
?Thanks so much, Sharks.
?Congrats.
"Congrats."
How would he have found me
to market this product?
That's right, Daymond.
It's a big issue, acquiring
the customer at the right time.
