You're gonna nickel?and?dime me
for the other couple percent?
No. $100,000 for 35%.
Wow. Robert.
Greiner: Robert!
Robert, come on.
What are you doing, Robert?
33 1/3%.
That's a point and a half.
Point and a half.
Six kids! Six kids.
[ Laughs ]
Wow. That ??
John: Come on, Robert.
$100,000, 35%.
I know
the work it takes
and the pain and the sweat
and all the other stuff.
I'm not trying
to sell you on it.
It's the offer
I think is good for me,
and I think
it's a good offer for you.
$100,000, 35%.
What are you gonna do?
Okay.
You got an offer, baby.
Let's do it!
[ Cheering ]
I didn't see that
coming.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm really glad!
Okay. Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.
Thanks, guys.
We'll see you.
Thank you so much.
Whoo!
Whoo?hoo!
Whoo!
Hyuh!
Ahh!
My name is Nick Baker,
from Los Angeles, California,
and I am currently seeking
$100,000 for a 20% investment
in my company, DadWare.
Now, Sharks,
I have revolutionized
the way fathers ??
yes, fathers ??
bring their children
into the world,
and it all started with
the birth of my daughter, Eva.
My wife, Dawn, was in labor
for 36 long, relatively
uneventful hours.
?Oy!
?Wow.
?Wow.
And then Eva decided
to make her debut,
and it was mass hysteria!
Machines were beeping,
scalpels were slicing,
and Dawns were screaming!
And I just wanted
to get out of the way.
But when the doctor went
to put Eva on Dawn's chest
for the critical skin?to?skin
bonding immediately after birth,
Dawn was in too much pain.
So, what's a new dad to do
but jump into the greatest role
he's ever played, of course?!
That of
listen?to?the?doctor dad!
I ripped off my shirt...
[ Laughter ]
...I took that baby...
and I put that baby
on my chest.
The doctor stopped.
The nurses were in awe.
A dad had finally listened!
[ Laughter ]
Now, over the next
couple of months,
I came to find out how special
the skin?to?skin
bonding thing really was.
I also found out that
not a whole lot of dads do it.
And because
I'm kind of jacked like a keg
and not ripped like Robert
over there...
[ Laughter ]
...and because dads need
a reminder to do the
skin?to?skin bonding at home,
I invented
the DadWare Bondaroo...
...a shirt that opens
for easy, convenient...
skin?to?skin bonding...
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
...at home or in the hospital
with your brand?new baby.
[ Laughs ]
Aww.
So...
[ Laughter ]
No! No! No!
[ Laughter continues ]
Please don't do that at home
with your baby.
[ Laughs ]
So, sharks, I don't have
a business degree.
I don't have
some crazy MBA.
What I do have is
an incredible work ethic
in a company that I built
from the ground up
and a product that,
frankly,
I think makes the world
a better place.
Sharks,
I'm talking about investment
in our fathers and our children,
and what could be better
than that?
Sometimes, we get bad theater.
That was <i>good</i> theater.
?Well, thank you.
?Very good.
?Yeah, that was very good.
I think you should have
a comedy routine.
I think I was
a former comedian and actor,
and that's one of the reasons
that I'm standing here.
Were you?
Would you like to see
the shirts?
'Cause that's a thing
we should do, right?
?[ Laughing ] Sure.
?I mean, we could just do that.
?We're all about you.
?We're into me. That's good.
That's good,
but hold on.
I forgot all about
the product, yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Here you are.
Thank you.
?Here you are, sir.
?Thank you, Nick.
?Brave man. Thank you.
?[ Laughs ]
?Thanks, Nick. Good job.
?Thank you very much.
So, Nick,
were you a comedian?
Yes.
I came to Los Angeles
about nine years ago
to be an actor
and a comedian,
and then about four years ago,
I had my baby,
and a 40?year?old waiter
isn't that cute.
I didn't feel like being poor
and living in L. A.
and that lifestyle of constantly
getting the next job.
And so I was like,
"Let's find a way out of this."
When did you have
the idea?
Four years ago?
Yeah. Yeah.
So, I had my baby.
I mean, that story's true.
I mean, I really did ??
Like, Dawn was in so much pain.
That's why I took the baby
on the chest,
and then when I realized
how important it was
that we did it ??
like, literally, the nurses
and doctors came up to me,
and they were shocked.
And I was like, "So,
you're telling me that
dads don't do this?"
Well, then I do research.
We really have to do this
with our kids.
It bonds us to our kids.
Now I have really refined
the product
to the point
where I'm super happy with it,
and I've also got my price down
in the United States.
What's it sell for?
I sell it for $39.99.
?And what do you make it for?
?What does it cost you?
$9.04 in
downtown Los Angeles.
That's a really
great price.
Making it in L. A.?
Mm?hmm.
And how many
have you sold?
I have sold $200,000 worth
in the last ??
?Yeah, baby.
?Wow.
?Good for you.
?That's really good.
And how are you getting
that message out?
Okay, that really
surprises me.
Where do you reach
that father?
I did not think
you were gonna say that.
You sold $200,000?
In the last year?
No. No. No. No.
How long?
Okay, so, I really started
selling November of 2016.
All the way up to 2017
of September,
we did, like, maybe $10,000.
Then from September 2017
to 2018, $71,000,
and then from September 2018
to 2019, $110,000.
Nick, what are you gonna do
with the $100,000?
Well, the first thing
is inventory.
Is that really
your problem?
Well, it's part of it.
Do you have orders
that you haven't filled?
No. I mean, I ??
Then why do you need
inventory?
Because I've always been
struggling with it.
And you're running
this business 100%?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is all I do.
Is anybody helping you?
How are you making
a living?
So, over the last year,
I've kind of been hemorrhaging
money on my credit cards,
but now this money is ??
the business is able
to pay me something now.
I mean, it can pay me, like,
Good for you.
Good for you.
a few thousand dollars a month
to keep our head above water.
So, Nick, you found
this very niche product.
I get it.
It's amazing.
And it's ??
Thanks.
And now, you know,
you have to find your customer.
But this is not a product
that appeals to me in any way
'cause I'm not gonna have
any skin bonding with kids.
[ Laughs ]
So, look, I wish you the best,
but I'm not your Shark. I'm out.
I tell you, Nick,
I'm fascinated
how you have
that amount of sales,
'cause you have a customer
that literally has one week
or whatever the case is
to have this experience.
And also, they can do it
various other ways ??
you know, just laying at home
with the baby.
I think you'll keep
doing well with it
because you're the person
in the space,
but it's not a business
that I can invest in.
I'm out.
[ Chuckling ] Okay.
Yeah, Nick,
along the same lines,
look, what you've
accomplished is great.
Nick, I really respect
the hustle.
But the timeframe to get
that customer is so small.
There's so many other ways
to do it.
I mean, power to you that you've
actually been able to do this,
but I can't connect the dots
going forward.
I ??
I'm out.
Thank you.
But there's still Lori,
the Sharkette.
[ Chuckles ]
It's a very niche market ??
like, just so small.
I find that it would be really
difficult for it to blow up.
But on the opposite side
of this,
all it takes
is one idea, right?
Which you have.
And this is a good idea.
And you can keep going
with this, and you can do more.
Right. Well ??
I just don't find that it's
the right investment for me.
So I'm sorry ??
I'm out.
Thank you, Nick.
It was a heck of a story.
?Good luck, Nick.
?Good luck to you.
?Thanks so much, Sharks.
?Congrats.
"Congrats."
How would he have found me
to market this product?
That's right, Daymond.
It's a big issue, acquiring
the customer at the right time.
And by the way, Mark,
I'm surprised you didn't think
about the Mavs using this.
This could've been
huge marketing for Mavs.
Dad with Mavs.
What do you think?
[ Laughter ]
"Dads with Mavs."
