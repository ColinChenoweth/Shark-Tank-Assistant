Beautiful Sharks,
my name is Jeff Appelbaum.
I'm from
Los Angeles, California.
I am here seeking ??
deep breaths...
[ Inhales deeply ]
...$500,000...
?Whoo!
?Whoa!
...for 5% of my company.
?Whoo!
?Whoo!
?Wow.
Today, I am here
to present Salted,
the largest delivery?first
restaurant group in the country.
We create better?for?you
restaurant brands
built for today's
health?conscious generation
without ever building
an actual four?wall restaurant.
We focus on delivery
and have already partnered
with every major delivery
platform in the market today.
So, who's in the mood for
some guilt?free pizza tonight?
With our flagship brand,
Califlower Pizza,
we make the world's best
gluten?free
cauliflower?crust pizza.
Mmm.
It's low?carb
and only 100 calories a slice.
Cuban: No way.
Greiner: Wow!
Ooh, Mama, that looks good!
[ Laughs ]
But it doesn't end there,
my dear Shark friends.
Who's in the mood
for some Chinese tonight?
ginger bird is a vegan?friendly,
soy?free twist
that your whole family
is gonna absolutely love.
Want to spice it up?
moonbowls is a healthy
Korean?inspired bowls concept.
When I eat this,
it is literally like a party
is happening in my mouth.
But perhaps
you want some greens
but you don't got
that green money.
Our brand,
the $5 Salad Company...
Corcoran: Wow.
...has delicious salads
for as low as...
$5.
...yeah, I think we're gonna
sell this one for 5 bucks.
By focusing on delivery,
we can operate not just one,
but a portfolio
of better?for?you brands
out of each one
of our kitchens,
sharing resources, ingredients,
labor, even shared rent.
Sharky Sharks, tell me,
[piece o']
who wants a pizza
this business...
[ Chuckles ]
...and to join Salted
in changing the way people eat
forever?
?Wow.
?Lovely.
Please eat.
I have some samples for you.
Front and center,
you have our famous gluten?free
cauliflower?crust pizza.
It's crispy like
a New York?style cheese pizza.
It's gluten?free.
This pizza is fabulous.
Pizza's solid.
Cuban:
I want another piece.
So, what am I eating here?
Is this the party in my mouth?
That <i>is</i> the party
in your mouth, Rohan.
I hope you brought
your party hat.
I did.
That's our avocado bulgogi.
That's Impossible meat.
We marinate it
in a garlic?ginger?soy sauce.
You have avocado, you have
some seaweed, some kimchi.
So some Korean?inspired flavors
that make this brand ??
This one looks like
a sweet?and?sour something...?
Orange chicken 2.0.
So, that goes
with ginger bird.
You think about
your orange sesame chicken
that you get
from a lot of places.
This, instead
of deep?frying it,
we coat it with a cauliflower
dredge and then we bake it.
So we call it "oven?fried."
That's great.
It's like
a sophisticated version.
It's fabulous.
Music to my ears, Barbara.
So, you are
an entirely online play?
There's no restaurant door
I can walk into
and have a seat, right?
We are optimized
for delivery,
and there's some pickup,
but there's no dine?in.
So, I know a lot of
you guys are familiar with
the restaurant industry,
and we know the notoriously thin
profit margins.
A lot of those are sucked up
by the front?of?house.
There's a lot going on here,
buddy. It's very impressive.
Can you take me
to the beginning?
How did you get here with
five different meal concepts?
Yeah. Yeah.
I am obsessed with food,
and I am obsessed
with building things.
I actually started the company
five years ago.
Wow.
I'm on my third life
with Salted.
One of my favorite investors
told me recently
that I'm a cockroach
because I've survived.
Oh, I love cockroaches.
Was it Kevin?
So, version 1 of Salted,
it was an online cooking school,
a pure digital play.
Great business,
great economics,
wasn't scaling at the rate
that I wanted to.
Version 2 ?? spent a lot of time
about 2 1/2 years ago
looking at the cooking?kit
space, meal?kit space,
the fundamental problems
of these businesses.
The fact is,
about 50% of those customers
are canceling
after their 30?day trial,
and they're spending $200
to acquire those customers.
That's sort of like
the Plated problem.
The Plated problem, but they got
out just in time, didn't they?
Yes, they did. Thank you.
That was my deal.
Kevin, were you in that?
Yes, I was.
Highest return or size of exit
in "Shark Tank" history.
And of course it would be
Mr. Wonderful, as it should be.
[ Chuckles ]
As it should be.
Okay, here we are at Salted.
How's it going?
It's going very well.
Tell us about it.
How well?
I would love to.
So, we did 250K this month.
We're on a $3 million
run rate.
Wow.
We have five locations
open today,
and next year ??
What cities?
We're in Los Angeles,
San Francisco, and Chicago.
Oza: Can you take me
through the year?
About $1.1 million
this year.
And we're increasing 20%
month over month.
And what did you make
or lose on that?
Over the last year,
we've been net?negative 750K.
So, what we have
right now ??
we have this giant market
of online delivery,
and it's subsidized
by a lot of private companies
and newly public companies.
So today,
our customer?acquisition cost
is effectively zero.
Corcoran:
How is that possible?
We partner with
all these delivery apps.
Because you're on
all the different applications.
Yes.
Are you on
every single one?
I'm sorry?
Are you on every single one?
I order a lot.
I use Postmates, Grubhub ??
everything.
We have partnered with every
major delivery platform.
And you are the first that sells
healthy, low?cal food?
That's correct.
So, Jeff, but how do you
create awareness?
It's just you're just sitting
on Grubhub and Postmates or...
Basically.
are you doing stuff
to drive awareness?
So, we didn't do anything except
partner with a great company
that is bringing customers
to their experience.
Jeff, you know what's going on
with CloudKitchen?
I do.
For the viewer at home,
a CloudKitchen is a kitchen
where multiple delivery?only
restaurants get to share it.
So you know that that's
basically a virtual opportunity
to do the same thing
you're doing?
There are folks that are
building the infrastructure,
and we can plug into
that infrastructure.
We're building the brands.
So you're saying you would use
CloudKitchen, potentially,
as a way to reduce
your capital costs.
Correct.
Okay.
How much have you raised
through outside investments
in those five years
you've been in business?
$5 million.
$5 million?
Yeah.
And how much have
those investors earned?
They're all still
on the cap table.
So they have not yet made
any money?
So, how much do you own?
Wait. I'm not done.
Okay, I'm sorry, Barbara.
Go ahead.
It's alright. It's alright.
So, for that reason alone,
I'm definitely out.
I have three questions.
One of the beautiful things
about the restaurant industry ??
it's a many?winner market.
I have three questions.
If you're selling pizza,
yeah, you might be
a competitor.
Hello.
If you're selling
Asian?inspired bowls,
you might be a competitor.
But we are literally better
positioned than anyone else
to take advantage
of this giant sea change
that's happening right now
in food delivery.
I'm here because
we're looking to build
a virtual restaurant empire
that makes a massive impact
on people's lives.
So, Jeff, I'm kind of
conflicted here,
because I don't know
if you have a unique idea
from the CloudKitchen, 'cause
everyone's gonna be doing that.
So it boils down to,
as Kevin said, creating a brand.
But that's not the part
that throws me.
I really like you.
Thank you, Rohan.
And you also
make me nervous.
I'll be honest.
Like, there's something
energetic about you,
and then there's something
scary about you.
And I don't know which side
of the coin I want to go on.
Rohan is interested in Jeff's
modern food?delivery concept,
Salted,
but he is conflicted
about the entrepreneur.
Oza:
I really like you.
Thank you, Rohan.
And you also
make me nervous.
I'll be honest.
Like, there's something
energetic about you,
and then there's something
scary about you.
And I don't know which side
of the coin I want to go on.
I speak fast,
so I get that, but...
Yeah.
...you speak
a little <i>too</i> fast, bud.
Okay.
So I don't know if I fully got
the answers to the questions,
and given that
I have concerns potentially,
if we worked together,
whether you would be listening
to feedback or not,
I'm gonna flip to the scary side
and say I'm out.
Jeff, customer acquisition
is the whole business,
at the end of the day,
and I love your claim
that you don't pay for it,
but all your competitors do.
You tell me
you're gonna take seven brands
and think that you can
support them individually.
Yeah.
It's seven times
the headache.
If I may ??
Wait, wait, wait.
In the end,
it's the sharp marketer
that can acquire customers
at the lowest price.
Maybe it'll be you,
but your business is not worth
10 million bucks right now.
So, to talk through
the valuation a little bit ??
Look,
you're an intriguing guy.
You are in
a very competitive market.
So, listen, Jeff,
I'm out.
But you still have
Daddy Warbucks over here.
So, Jeff,
the challenge is ??
And Lori, no?
O'Leary:
You're not out, are you?
This isn't really
a food business.
I wasn't out.
I mean, it <i>is</i> on its surface,
but fundamentally,
it's an SEO?on?delivery?apps
business.
So when CloudKitchen opens up
in every city,
how are you gonna
set yourself apart
when there's
a thousand delivery options?
We are building
great brands.
That's not the answer
I'm looking for.
I still think it's gonna take
unique SEO skill sets.
Absolutely ??
so, once we get
this initial exposure
on these different apps,
we're able to put fuel
on the fire, right?
And how do you put fuel
on the fire?
It's intelligent marketing.
It's SEO, it's SEM.
Okay, so when you talk
about SEO, SEM...
Yeah. Yeah.
...where?
Well, we're targeting
specific customers
in the cities
where we're live, right?
People who are ??
Within the apps?
When we do start
spending cash ??
When you do? Okay.
Yeah.
We're not on the same page,
Jeff.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
And then there was Lori.
You know,
I have to say,
I'm the consumer
of this kind of food.
You finished it all,
Lori.
Because I eat ?? Yeah.
I've been sitting here,
and I was the last one in,
but as you were speaking,
your eyes kept going to Rohan
or to anyone else.
I was the last one in
for you.
I don't know
if that made you nervous.
It's the dress
you're wearing, Lori.
But I think
it's really important
when I partner
with someone
that I feel that that partner
really wants me,
so I would have been in,
but in this situation,
I was not feeling that from you.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Ouch.
Cuban: Good luck, Jeff.
I appreciate your time, guys.
And, uh...
have a great day.
Good luck.
Corcoran: Yeah, good luck.
It went from high energy
to sadness.
I just want to say
something.
Don't you feel sad?
That guy
didn't get a deal
'cause nobody wanted to
partner with him.
Absolutely.
He avoided my eyes.
Appelbaum:
Wasn't super over?the?moon
with Lori's comments,
but I'm gonna be talking
to my mom about it later,
and we're gonna do
some deep therapy sessions,
so we'll see what comes of it.
