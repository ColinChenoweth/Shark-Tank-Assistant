Beautiful Sharks,
my name is Jeff Appelbaum.
I'm from
Los Angeles, California.
I am here seeking ??
deep breaths...
[ Inhales deeply ]
...$500,000...
?Whoo!
?Whoa!
...for 5% of my company.
?Whoo!
?Whoo!
?Wow.
Today, I am here
to present Salted,
the largest delivery?first
restaurant group in the country.
That's correct.
So, Jeff, but how do you
create awareness?
Jeff, you know what's going on
with CloudKitchen?
I do.
For the viewer at home,
a CloudKitchen is a kitchen
where multiple delivery?only
restaurants get to share it.
So you know that that's
basically a virtual opportunity
to do the same thing
you're doing?
There are folks that are
building the infrastructure,
So, Jeff, I'm kind of
conflicted here,
because I don't know
if you have a unique idea
from the CloudKitchen, 'cause
everyone's gonna be doing that.
Rohan is interested in Jeff's
modern food?delivery concept,
Salted,
but he is conflicted
about the entrepreneur.
Oza:
I really like you.
Thank you, Rohan.
Jeff, customer acquisition
is the whole business,
at the end of the day,
So, listen, Jeff,
I'm out.
But you still have
Daddy Warbucks over here.
We're not on the same page,
Jeff.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Cuban: Good luck, Jeff.
I appreciate your time, guys.
Appelbaum:
Wasn't super over?the?moon
with Lori's comments,
but I'm gonna be talking
to my mom about it later,
