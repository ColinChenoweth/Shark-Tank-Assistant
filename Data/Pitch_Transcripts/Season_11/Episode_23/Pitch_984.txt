but Anthony's admission
may have tanked his chances
for a deal for his innovative
office?supply company mcSquares.
What I'm picking up from you,
listening to you,
is every question we ask,
you give a three?part answer.
You're all over the board.
Are you organized?
No.
Ooh.
Who let you in here?
Well, that's why
he's got stickies.
Greiner: But I love
that you're honest.
But I have organized people
around me.
Corcoran:
You're definitely honest.
That's a great answer.
It took me a while
to get comfortable with the fact
that I suck
at organization.
Good for you on that.
Thank you.
Now,
the unfortunate side is,
I have a company
called Writeyboard
that does not the same things...
?Yeah.
...but they're
whiteboard?driven,
but that $10 million,
Anthony, is nothing.
When you scale,
you'll get that
in a week worth of orders
if it works.
But if I'm gonna take
this journey with you,
10% is not enough at all,
given the risk.
Fair.
Here's my offer. It's
the only one I'm gonna make.
$300,000 for 25%.
I really appreciate
your thoughtfulness.
You're bringing up things that
go through my head every day,
?Congrats, Anthony.
?Love your jacket.
?Wish you the best.
?Thank you.
Oh, did I mention the jacket
is thrown in on the deal?
Give it to Mr. Wonderful.
Really?
[ Laughter ]
It's yours.
Let me try that on.
It should fit.
He's got four more.
[ Laughs ]
It <i>does</i> fit.
Thank you very much.
Oza: Look at that!
Now, that's
a Mr. Wonderful look.
Alright. Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
Nice.
Franco: Anybody that has Kevin
as a partner
is super, super lucky.
This was easily the hardest
thing I have <i>ever</i> done.
Easily.
