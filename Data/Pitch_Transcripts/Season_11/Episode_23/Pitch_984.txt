I'm Anthony Franco, and I'm from
beautiful Denver, Colorado.
I'm the CEO and founder
of mcSquares,
and I'm seeking $300,000
for 10% of this ??
our family of collaborative
dry?erase products so ingenious,
we named it after Einstein's
legendary equation
E = MC squared.
Oh, it wasn't me?
[ Laughter ]
These are reusable
dry?erase stickies.
They stick
without any adhesive,
so you can use them again
and again.
A six?pack
of mcSquare Stickies
can replace
over 12,000 paper sticky notes.
[ Pop, whistle ]
Oh!
Oh!
?[ Laughing ] Oh, my God.
?Oh, my God!
?Damn!
?Holy smokes!
?Oh, my God!
?Damn!
?I'm sorry.
?That is beautiful.
?Don't do that again.
?I need a restroom break.
[ Laughter ]
It's a total waste
of resources,
and, Mr. Wonderful, it's a waste
of your favorite ?? money.
Let's do the math.
1,000 paper notes on average
costs 22 bucks.
Multiple that times 12,
and you get $264
for 12,000 paper sticky notes.
Now, for comparison,
a six?pack of mcSquare Stickies
costs around 20 bucks.
264 minus 20, and you get
well over $200 in savings.
What's worse is, if you multiply
this math times 50 million,
you get 60 billion.
That's how many paper notes
are discarded every year.
That's roughly
250,000 trees' worth.
Now, that was some
pretty boring math, but wait.
There's more!
[ Laughter ]
?If you act now...
?There always is.
...I'll throw in
my four?in?one tablets.
Our dynamic dry?erase tablets
allow you to layer your thoughts
during brainstorming sessions
and let your ideas
truly blossom.
And you can seamlessly line up
your calendar events,
like for me,
when I'm planning to write out
your big, fat
return?on?investment checks.
?[ Chuckles ]
?So, Sharks,
now that we don't need
all this paper for notes,
let's recycle it into confetti
and celebrate our deal.
How about I bring you
some samples?
Good enough
Rohan, this is a tablet
and our calendar.
Oh, wow!
?Oh, wow!
?It's a great sketch.
Wow.
Did you do that?
?Yes, I did.
?You're an artist?
?I'm a wannabe artist.
?Thank you, sir.
Except, Rohan,
doesn't look like you.
?It's fantastic.
?You don't look that good.
?Well, honestly...
?Aw, girl, please. Girl, please!
Your eyes look a little,
you know...
...the tablets allowed me
to cheat. They're templated.
So I actually put a picture
of you underneath...
You can overlay. Yeah.
...and I was able
to trace you underneath.
Tell us your story
a little bit,
'cause you got a lot
of creativity going on here.
How did you get here,
and what was this "Aha" moment?
I <i>barely</i> graduated high school.
[ Chuckles ]
I was a stereotypical teased?
and?picked?on computer nerd.
I was kind of a wallflower.
Aw.
I didn't engage with
our teachers
and with fellow students.
Hard to believe,
looking at you right now.
That's changed.
It's forced.
I swear to you, it's forced.
?I don't believe you.
?[ Chuckles ]
So I started
a little consulting business,
and we had
this amazing meeting,
a lot of pompous executives
in the room.
Well, it was over, we were
patting ourselves on the back,
and a saleswoman
who had been in the meeting,
who had said nothing
in the room,
came up to me and said,
"Have you thought about..."
and then started laying out
all the stupid decisions
that we made
in a very nice way.
And I thought, "Well,
how come we couldn't get her
to speak up in the room?"
And so I took our whiteboard,
carved it up
into little squares,
handed it around the room.
It was like magic.
Everybody contributed.
In certain environments,
everybody's scared to speak up,
and the people
with the best ideas
are the ones that are
least likely to share them,
and that's the impetus of
the version 1 of the tablet.
O'Leary: You're slapping it onto
a magnetic surface, right?
Yes.
The surface
has to be metallic.
Yes.
So this is primarily
in the home.
That represents
the refrigerator, I guess?
Yes.
I think I planned for that.
[ Chuckles ]
So ??
But where do I find that
in my office? What surface ??
Yeah. Excellent.
This ?? We've sold 30 of these
this year.
But offices today have
more and more glass in them
than anything else.
So, our product for that
is our stickies.
So the stickies ??
like I said, they stick ??
What does that stick ??
what substrate
is that sticking to?
Anything smooth.
So if a suction cup will stick
to it, this will stick to it.
The dry?erase boards
that are already in offices?
Yes, exactly. Exactly.
So, who is the audience
you're going after?
It's anybody looking for
paper sticky notes.
We've only been in market
with those for four months.
What are the sales
so far?
So, this year,
we've done $214,000.
Whoa!
We'll do $110,000
this month,
and we'll do a million dollars
this year.
?Ooh!
?Something is spiking here.
You've been around for a while.
?Mm?hmm.
Last year,
you sold 200K.
This <i>month,</i>
you expect to do $100,000?
Something's wrong there
with the math, right?
So something is exploding
in your sales
from going from $200,000
in an entire year ??
nice, interesting numbers,
but not overly exciting...
Yeah.
...to basically
a $1.2 million run rate,
assuming you sustain that.
?Yes, sir.
?What suddenly changed?
So, the first version
of our product,
I contract?manufactured.
So I sent it overseas,
called to make my next order,
and ?? a big surprise ??
I had manufacturing issues.
You've never heard that before
in the Tank.
?No. First time. First time.
?Ever. You're the first.
So, the manufacturing issue
was they lost the molds.
The molds?
The molds.
They lost the molds.
They <i>stole</i> the molds.
No one loses molds.
Greiner: Tell me, please,
that they remade the molds
and paid for it.
?No.
?No?
I had a decision to make ??
I could have fought that,
but getting the feedback
on version 1, I thought
maybe we had an opportunity
to redesign a little bit
and be more in control
of our own destiny,
so I brought manufacturing
in?house.
We redesigned
the entire product line
so we can manufacture it
in Denver.
What's the long?term strategy
on cost?
Well, our margins on stickies
is 92%.
And can you scale that?
So, the factory that I built
can scale to 10 million,
and the plan ??
?$10 million?
$10 million
in retail revenue.
That's not a lot.
What I'm picking up from you,
listening to you,
is every question we ask,
you give a three?part answer.
You're all over the board.
Are you organized?
No.
O'Leary: Ooh.
Who let you in here?
but Anthony's admission
may have tanked his chances
for a deal for his innovative
office?supply company mcSquares.
What I'm picking up from you,
listening to you,
is every question we ask,
you give a three?part answer.
You're all over the board.
Are you organized?
No.
Ooh.
Who let you in here?
Well, that's why
he's got stickies.
Greiner: But I love
that you're honest.
But I have organized people
around me.
Corcoran:
You're definitely honest.
That's a great answer.
It took me a while
to get comfortable with the fact
that I suck
at organization.
Good for you on that.
Thank you.
Now,
the unfortunate side is,
I have a company
called Writeyboard
that does not the same things...
?Yeah.
...but they're
whiteboard?driven,
and there's
some similar products.
So, for those reasons,
I have to say I'm out,
but congratulations.
Thank you, Mark.
Look at you.
You are not a wallflower
anymore.
[ Laughs ]
You're amazing.
I think you should be extremely
proud, standing here today.
It's a really cool concept,
but this isn't a product that
I really feel passionate about.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
I would never,
in any capacity,
see you as an introvert
up there
or someone who lacks
a huge amount of confidence.
Your energy
is infectious.
I don't understand
the product fully.
Ugh!
I see the problem
you've delivered,
which is hundreds of millions
of sticky notes flying around,
but I don't know
if people will see that
as a major problem
for themselves.
So, unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.
Ugh.
I want to pull you back in.
[ Chuckles ]
You're the kind of guy
that I'm in love with, okay?
[ Chuckles ]
Because you're the guy
that I identify with.
I was a dumb kid
out of 10 kids.
All my siblings got straight A's
without opening a book,
and I never got anything
beyond a D.
I was the kid in school
that the kids laughed at
when I was made
to read out loud.
I would've just jumped in
any hole I could possibly find.
Yeah. Totally identify
with that.
And I was the only kid
with no friends.
So I love people like you.
But I'm being reminded of
how much I love my sticky notes.
I think I'm gonna go
in that direction.
I think I'm
going to go out.
Thank you, Barbara.
So, I'm in this business
on both sides.
This office business
is a two?tier distribution,
so that's not gonna work.
It's just not gonna work.
This business
is interesting.
What I hate about it
is the factory, okay?
I've sold $40,000 of those
this month online.
No, I get it,
but that $10 million,
Anthony, is nothing.
When you scale,
you'll get that
in a week worth of orders
if it works.
But if I'm gonna take
this journey with you,
10% is not enough at all,
given the risk.
Fair.
Here's my offer. It's
the only one I'm gonna make.
$300,000 for 25%.
I really appreciate
your thoughtfulness.
You're bringing up things that
go through my head every day,
and I appreciate
the connections that you have
for manufacturing
outside of the U. S.
and would love
to tap into that.
I mean, you got to scale, man.
You got to get big.
We're on the same page.
I totally agree with you.
Do you like his offer?
It's definitely more equity
than I wanted to give away.
So, what's the counter?
Would you be willing
to do 20%?
No.
I've been where you are already
multiple times, my friend.
Fair.
This is not going to be easy.
It's hell.
For me,
that's 25% or nothing.
What do you want to do?
?Congrats, Anthony.
?Love your jacket.
?Wish you the best.
?Thank you.
Oh, did I mention the jacket
is thrown in on the deal?
Give it to Mr. Wonderful.
Really?
[ Laughter ]
It's yours.
Let me try that on.
It should fit.
He's got four more.
[ Laughs ]
It <i>does</i> fit.
Thank you very much.
Oza: Look at that!
Now, that's
a Mr. Wonderful look.
Alright. Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
Nice.
Franco: Anybody that has Kevin
as a partner
is super, super lucky.
This was easily the hardest
thing I have <i>ever</i> done.
Easily.
And I'm super grateful
for being a part of this show.
It's any entrepreneur's dream.
