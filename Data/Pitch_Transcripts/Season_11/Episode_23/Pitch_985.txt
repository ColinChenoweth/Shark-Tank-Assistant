What up, Sharks?
I'm Manny.
I'm Josh.
And we are Slate Chocolate Milk.
We're seeking $400,000
in exchange for 10%
of our business.
Sharks, you <i>can</i> be the happiest
version of yourselves
if you embrace who you are
and what you enjoy.
Lori, you <i>can</i> sing in traffic
if it makes you smile.
Mark, you <i>can</i> wear that hat
if you feel like it's just you.
[ Laughter ]
?And, Kev, my guy...
?Yeah!
...my guy, you <i>can</i> do
that workout,
'cause if it's exercise
to you...
Nice body.
...who cares?
And, Sharks...
Nice socks, Kev.
...that's why
we <i>can</i> chocolate milk.
[ Tab pops ]
Literally.
We are Slate,
the first lower?sugar,
higher?protein line
of lactose?free chocolate milks
for adults.
We use a process
called ultra?filtration,
which allows us
to filter out
the natural lactose sugars
from milk,
leaving us with a creamy,
better?for?you chocolate milk.
We pair that with a popular
latte canning process,
which makes these puppies
shelf?stable,
able to be shipped
to your doorstep.
Sharks,
you <i>can</i> be a part
of our chocolate milk
revolution.
So, who wants to join
us modern milkmen
and give chocolate milk
a clean slate?
A clean slate?
[ Laughter ]
?Let us try it.
?Yeah, we got some.
?Mark and I can drink this?
?Yes. Lactose?free.
'Cause this will be
a very short pitch if we can't.
And just so you know,
before we hand these out ??
we have one can.
It's just a prototype,
though.
The can is just
a prototype.
?That means presales, right?
?It does.
$4 million valuation, huh?
On no revenue.
Kevin's gonna love ??
Please. Allow me
to get the numbers.
?And he's still smiling.
?[ Laughs ]
So, what do you
want to start with? Dark?
?We go dark first?
?So, dark first.
?Okay, dark first.
?Dark first.
Lubin:
So, this dark chocolate ??
we are targeting
the dairy?alternative drink ??
Ohh!
I do not like that at all.
Mark, do you drink
dark chocolate?
Do you eat
dark chocolate?
I <i>eat</i> dark chocolate.
You do?
Yeah. It's just...
?I mean, I didn't love it.
?Okay.
But when Mark threw up on it,
I liked it more,
so, like,
it's come the other way.
I like the classic
better than the dark, actually.
That's fair. So, the classic
should remind you
of that chocolate milk
that you drank growing up.
There's a distinct dryness after
you swallow it, on my tongue.
There's a little funky?chicken
thing going on there.
'Cause I know what
chocolate milk tastes like.
It's one
of my greatest weaknesses,
and I would love to get away
from the calories.
Exactly.
I'm hoping
you're telling me
this is a big
alternative?calorie option.
Absolutely.
Yes.
So,
we have 75% less sugar
than chocolate milks
currently on the market.
You could have three of
our cans, and that would equate
to the amount of sugar
and more or less calories.
So, we have 130 calories
in each one of our cans.
We have nine grams
of sugar.
Why is it so big?
So, the protein, baby.
Half of consumers
right now
are decreasing
the amount of sugar,
which is why we're playing
on that trend,
and increasing
the amount of protein.
What do you make it for now?
So, right now,
we make it for 85 cents.
Selling it to a distributor
at what price?
$1.77. 52%.
But they haven't
sold yet.
So, you'll be out at $3.99
at retail?
$2.99.
$2.99.
Corcoran:
You said it's a prototype,
so I would assume you haven't
produced the product yet.
Yes, so, we've done
a pilot run.
But yet,
you have a big price on it.
So, the valuation.
?Yeah, let's get to that.
?Let's talk about it.
We're going straight
to valuation.
O'Leary:
No, no, but I like it.
Either I eviscerate you now
or you defend it now.
We're gonna own it.
?It is absurd!
?So, what were you thinking?
So, you have two ridiculously
good?looking founders,
which is a huge part
of the valuation.
Modest, too.
Only to Barbara.
So, our third partner was
a food broker for 40 years,
and he grew the largest
Greek yogurt company
from $140,000 in sales
to over $150 million
in the Northeast alone.
That is one of the reasons
it's worth $4 million?
He's invested in
three other businesses
that are all doing
over $20 million in sales...
?So?
?Wait.
...and he is a partner, and he
is basically our VP of sales.
So you don't need a Shark.
Greiner:
Wait, but you're saying,
"'Cause this guy was successful
with other businesses,
we're worth
this valuation"?
Yeah, it's a non?sequitur.
Doesn't make sense.
So, the reason why
we talk that way
is because
of the relationships.
You know as good as anybody
in the food world,
it's all about
your relationships.
The way
that we're getting it ??
we've gotten in front
of already four major retailers,
and we've been able to do that
because of him.
But it's all about the product
at the end of the day, right?
Absolutely.
You can have
a million connections,
but if people don't like
the product or the taste...
O'Leary: Wait a second.
The planet I come from,
it's all about the profits.
You don't have any.
You're asking us to pay
an enormous price...
Yep.
...valuated at $4 million
based on the fact
that you got a cool guy
that built another business
who's working with you.
That we don't know about.
If you're worth $4 million,
I wonder what <i>I'm</i> worth.
I've got
a lot of relationships.
Greiner: Yeah.
I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I got to be worth
like $4 billion.
Oza: I would say.
No, that's <i>me,</i> Kevin.
That's Mark.
[ Laughter ]
It's ridiculous.
Ha?pah!
We know we're at
the starting line.
I just don't want
that big foot to crush you.
I know it's coming,
and I know it's gonna happen.
It's gonna be ugly.
I'm doing everything
in my power
to help you
get us to that $4 million.
Yeah.
Yep.
In fact, you are now farther
away than when you came in here.
I think there's something here
that's, like, really wrong.
You haven't sold a thing,
but you're saying
that I should give you $400,000
on kind of
a wish and a prayer.
Do you realize
how that sounds weird?
Yeah.
I think that we probably
didn't frame the entire ??
like, where we are
correctly.
I think that's probably
something we did incorrectly.
If you'd come in with sales and
other things and all of that ??
You're just too early.
No, absolutely.
You're just too early.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Have you guys raised money
already?
We have.
We raised about $200,000.
?At what valuation?
?At what valuation?
Around a $400,000
valuation way back.
About a year ago.
So you sold half the company
for $200,000?
15%, and he bought in,
and he gives us 10 hours a week.
We're gonna pay
10 times more
than the "super sales dude,"
right?
I mean...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.
...you're not even
chocolate milk cockroaches.
You are single?cell amoeba.
You are <i>nothing</i> yet.
It doesn't taste good enough yet
to go to market.
You know
you got to work on it, okay?
I think that's fair.
I'm just telling you.
I appreciate it.
And I think
everybody agrees here.
So, I want
to be kind to you.
Definitely.
I'm working on a new,
nicer Mr. Wonderful.
Oh, good Lord!
And I'm having
a really hard time with you,
containing myself,
but I'm smiling.
I'm out.
Lubin:
Thanks for your time.
And that's fair.
Thank you, Kevin.
And just so you guys know,
we've done over 100 iterations.
But what you didn't provide
for us
is any proof that you surveyed
10,000 people.
But if you had said, "We've done
this many taste tests.
We've analyzed it.
We've perfected it.
We find that people
will pay the price"...
Right.
You basically went from
a business?planning concept
to "Give us your money,"
and that's really rough
to ask any investor to do.
I think that's fair.
Yeah. We appreciate that.
So, because of those reasons,
I'm out.
Alright. Thank you.
Guys,
you saw my reaction.
For a protein shake,
okay,
you're willing to accept
that it's not the same.
Mm?hmm.
I just don't think it's, like,
"Oh, wow, this is amazing,
and I just
have to have it."
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Alright.
Thank you, Mark.
Okay, Rohan, beverage guy.
Ro.
Okay, guys,
I like you guys' energy.
I like your thinking
of where you're going ??
your protein's high,
your sugar's low.
Yeah. Yeah.
But when I go with my gut
on this,
and that's all we have to go
with when you have zero sales...
Yeah.
...my gut on the product is
it's just not there.
Okay.
Unfortunately, I'm out.
Okay.
Appreciate it.
?Go out and crush it.
?Good luck.
?Prove us all wrong.
?Thank you for the time.
Really appreciate it.
?Congrats, guys. Good luck.
Belinsky:
It was really just, diving into
the valuation super early
didn't allow us to tell our
story, talk about our product,
talk about all the relationships
that we have.
It was a great
learning experience,
'cause if we had to do it again,
we'd do it differently.
Yeah,
and the Sharks were hungry.
Let me tell you.
They're just hungry.
[ Laughs ]
