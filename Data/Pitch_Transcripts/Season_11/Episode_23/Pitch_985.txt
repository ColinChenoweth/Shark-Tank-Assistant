What up, Sharks?
I'm Manny.
Lubin:
So, this dark chocolate ??
we are targeting
the dairy?alternative drink ??
Ohh!
I do not like that at all.
Mark, do you drink
dark chocolate?
Do you eat
dark chocolate?
I <i>eat</i> dark chocolate.
You do?
Yeah. It's just...
?I mean, I didn't love it.
?Okay.
But when Mark threw up on it,
I liked it more,
so, like,
it's come the other way.
I like the classic
better than the dark, actually.
That's fair. So, the classic
should remind you
of that chocolate milk
that you drank growing up.
There's a distinct dryness after
you swallow it, on my tongue.
There's a little funky?chicken
thing going on there.
'Cause I know what
chocolate milk tastes like.
It's one
of my greatest weaknesses,
Belinsky:
It was really just, diving into
the valuation super early
didn't allow us to tell our
story, talk about our product,
talk about all the relationships
that we have.
It was a great
learning experience,
'cause if we had to do it again,
we'd do it differently.
