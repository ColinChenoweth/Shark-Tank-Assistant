Hello, Sharks.
My name is Eric Hartsfield.
And I'm Brett Russell.
Together, we are Rescue Ready,
from Norfolk, Virginia.
We are here seeking $75,000
for 15% of our company.
As firefighters, sadly,
we see the tragic fates
of families that don't have
a quick and safe way
to escape a fire
in their own home.
Sharks, we are here to tell you
it is not like you see on TV.
When you're trapped
in a real house fire,
there's scorching flames,
dark smoke, and toxic gases
that are very likely to block
your doors and hallways,
leaving windows
as the only pathway to safety
for you and your family.
We've seen firsthand how
the increased use of synthetics
in building materials
and products
means fires are burning hotter
and faster than ever before.
Three minutes to escape.
Think about that.
That is why
we created Rescue Ready.
Rescue Ready is an emergency
escape ladder system
that is fully integrated
into the frame of the window
and anchored to the structural
components of your home.
To use Rescue Ready,
simply raise the window...
remove the cover...
take out our ladder...
remove the strap...
and throw.
Within seconds, even a child
can begin evacuation.
Wow.
People need
a practical means of escape,
one that is already connected
exactly where you want it,
when you need it most.
Okay, Sharks.
Both: Who's ready
to be rescue ready?
You won't get burned
on this deal.
[ Laughter ]
Oza: Oh, nice!
Alright,
let's have some fun.
We want to do a demonstration.
I need two volunteers.
?I'll volunteer.
?Awesome. Come on up.
?Do high heels work?
?Oh, we can make them work.
Do you sleep in high heels?
?No, no, no. [ Chuckles ]
We're gonna have you use
the ladder
that everybody's
familiar with.
It's the one that's sold
in the big?box stores.
It's the one
the manufacturer tells you,
"Keep it in the closet
or keep it under the bed."
We're gonna have you use that
for the demonstration.
Alright, have a seat
right here.
Mr. Oza.
The goggles Eric's passing out,
they're very similar
to the way we train
in the fire department.
We've placed a cover
over the lens.
It simulates a smoky room
and enables us
to really practice
with limited visibility.
When y'all hear the alarm,
you're gonna sit up...
Mm?hmm.
...you're gonna put
your goggles on
and you're gonna make your way
to the windows.
Mr. Oza,
you're gonna make your way
directly to
the Rescue Ready window.
Got it.
Okay?
Once you get that ladder out
and in your hands,
we're gonna stop you and tell
you to remove your goggles.
Ms. Corcoran,
just remember,
you've got to go under the bed
to get yours, okay?
But she's got a dress on.
You might want to do it ??
?Okay, let's switch, then.
?You want to switch?
?Let's switch. Alright, Mr. Oza.
?Oh, great!
Oh, you sucked them right in
there, Barbara.
Oza:
I got suckered in here.
Now <i>you</i> have to go under
the bed and get the ladder.
Better.
Okay?
So, the manufacturer
recommends that.
We're gonna put it
right here.
Alright, go ahead and lay back.
Don't put your goggles on yet.
Alright,
let's get ready to go.
Something's not right, man.
Something's not right.
Fires never happen
the same day
that the dad goes
and buys the ladder...
You're right.
...gives it to the kid,
explains it,
and shows them
where they put it.
Alright,
so, what do we got to do?
I think it's safe to say
this is way too neat.
Alright, come on.
Let's mess it up a little bit.
Shoes.
Shoes?
What is this? Toys.
Toys.
I'm getting royally jacked.
A ball.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Blanket.
You <i>are</i> jacked.
So,
y'all ready to go?
?Yeah.
?I'm ready.
Game time.
[ Smoke alarm beeping ]
[ Grunts ]
Plus,
I'll mess my hair up.
[ Beeping continues ]
Russell:
High heels and all. Nice.
This is the bed. Box.
Alright,
make your way over here.
It's not that one.
Okay, fire, damn it!
Alright, so,
a couple things
that Mr. Oza's not having to
deal with right now, right?
There's no heat.
Alright, great job,
Ms. Corcoran.
There's no heat
right now.
You're ready to go.
Oh, cool.
You found some shoes.
Oh!
There's no heat.
All we're asking him to do
is get this simple contraption,
right, over to that window
and attached properly.
[Bleep] I'm dead.
He's dead.
I'm dead.
So, I think we demonstrated
really clearly...
Wow.
...how difficult
the existing ladders are
to use in
a real stressful environment.
They're just
really unrealistic.
Have you started
selling these yet?
So, we are
a licensing play.
Okay.
So no, we have not.
Okay.
So, we're gearing this ??
the most optimal situation
is for new construction.
Take the side of the window
manufacturer for a second.
So,
I'm the giant window guy.
You come to me with this patent
and you show it to me,
and I say to myself,
"Okay, that's gonna increase
my cost for that window by" ??
By how much?
About what? 200 bucks?
100 bucks? How much?
$90.
$90 per window. Okay.
Spaced out over a 30?year
mortgage ?? 28 cents a month.
Oh, you're not just gonna do it
for one window?
One in every
second?floor bedroom.
The problem with that is,
It's the builder.
it's the consumer and the person
living in the home
that worries about it
and cares about it.
The builder is just trying
to put up a home
at the cheapest amount
that he can
and sell the home
for the highest amount.
That's where I see
the challenge.
Oza: But couldn't you
upsell this?
So, when people are building a
house and picking out things...
Could be an option.
...they pick out
their carpet...
Yeah, it's an option.
...they pick out
their paint colors...
For you guys to make money
on this...
Yes, sir.
...you're looking for ??
like, every time they use one,
what do you expect them
to pay you?
10 bucks?
What's the scenario?
Well, we'd go after
a very moderate 6% royalty.
6% royalty?
Yeah.
For them to put this and
change it into their tooling ??
so, are you confident that,
for $90, they can do that?
Because they've got to change
a bunch of tooling
to put this in.
They do,
but it's gonna pay off,
because if they advertise
properly,
they're gonna have moms and dads
that want these windows.
And you haven't approached
any home builder
or window company and said,
"Hey, guys" ??
Like, have you got any sort
of test feedback from that?
We have been scared to death,
being new to this,
about doing that,
until about three weeks ago...
You don't want to release it.
...because of the patents.
I mean, we're new to this.
Look, we're firefighters, right?
No, I respect that.
We're so new to this,
and it's our baby,
and we don't want anybody
to steal it
and we've been so hesitant.
That's smart of you.
You got to know going in,
this is a 5? to 10?year haul.
Industries ?? particularly
residential construction ??
have been doing it
the same way for eons.
It's gonna be a long slog.
I'm just not the
residential?construction guru
that some of these folks are,
so for those reasons, I'm out,
but congrats.
Thank you, Mark.
It's a great idea.
Yeah.
Thanks for the time.
What I see here is
a large fly in the ointment,
and the fly is, you got to pitch
to a window manufacturer
that they should change
their formula for success
with no upside to them.
They're excited about
their bottom line,
and this is a disruption
to their bottom line.
So, I would suggest you
have to take your wonderful box
and think of another place
to house it.
I would take
that same beautiful box that,
if it were lower
below the window
and screwed into the floor,
it would almost look like
a slim air conditioner
that wouldn't really
bother people.
It would accomplish for you
what you want,
which is to have it in its place
when it's needed,
but you wouldn't have to
partner with a window company,
'cause I don't think
that's ever gonna happen.
So, to the point of no upside
for the window company ??
there'll be
a $90 to $100 increase
in the price
of the window itself,
and, plus,
if they market this right,
they're gonna sell
houses full of windows.
What about Barbara's idea
of doing the floor?
I think what Barbara's
trying to say ??
you always want to control
your own destiny.
I'm afraid I'm out.
I just don't think it will fly.
I wish you great success,
'cause this does save lives.
I get it. But it's a journey
I can't go with you on.
I'm out.
Okay.
Appreciate it.
Um...
Listen, everybody
that watches "Shark Tank" knows
I have a soft spot
for firemen.
Me too.
Everyday heroes.
And it kills me
to not give you an offer.
But I just don't feel
it's investable for me,
so I'm out.
You guys
are truly quality people.
Thank you.
But you're running uphill
with a backpack full of rocks
because you're having the guys
retool stuff
they've spent hundreds
of millions of dollars
building on lines
to get efficient as heck.
Well, thanks very much.
Just to touch on
a couple things you said ??
It's a whole lot
to ask these companies
to change the way
they've done business for years.
The good thing
about that is,
there's hundreds
of window companies.
So, we don't land a deal
with 1 through 10?
No big deal.
There's a hungry window company
out there
that's gonna take
this flyer,
and they're gonna take
the flyer
because parents are gonna want
this in their house.
I agree.
I just wish
you'd come in
with one of those
hungry window companies.
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Russell:
Maybe I'm just naive.
I don't think
it's that big of an ask
to have window companies
out there at least consider it.
So, America,
you need this product.
We want to get it to
any American that wants it.
And there's a window company
out there
that's gonna step up
and help us do that.
Gonna do the right thing.
