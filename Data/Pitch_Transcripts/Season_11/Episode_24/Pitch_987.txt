Hi, I'm Rachel, and I'm
the Chief Enthusiasm Officer.
Herjavec: [ Chuckles ]
And I'm Joe,
and I'm the Chief
Relaxation Officer.
We're seeking $400,000 in
exchange for 7% of our company.
Wow.
Between the e?mails
popping up in your inbox,
24?hour news blaring
from every screen...
[ Sighs ]
...and constant pinging
interruptions...
[ Sighs ]
...from your smartphone,
we're all feeling
more overwhelmed
and stressed out
than ever.
[ Sighs ]
We're all sick of feeling busy,
hectic, and rushed,
and our solution
to this frustration
is not another app
or gadget.
Our solution is the world's most
ridiculously comfy hammock.
[ Chuckles ]
Introducing
Yellow Leaf Hammocks.
As Yellow Leaf Hammocks,
we've perfected the hammock
for the modern consumer.
We've conquered
every obstacle,
from creating a cocoon?like,
no?wobble design
to a shockingly soft yarn
so you won't get a rope burn
when you're trying to relax.
And they're completely
weather safe.
Now we're breaking
the boundaries of relaxation
with our new invention,
the hammock throne.
Wow.
The hammock throne is
an indoor?outdoor hammock chair
that makes it possible
to relax absolutely anywhere.
With the hammock throne,
you have a gorgeous
piece of furniture
that you can put out
in your living room,
on your tiny balcony,
or even in your office.
It extends back to create
a full?length hammock,
large enough
for a 7?foot person,
all within a diameter
of just 3 1/2 feet.
Wow!
And it swivels 360 degrees
so you can angle it...
Oh, that's cool.
...to gaze out the window
or relax while you watch
"Shark Tank."
[ Chuckles ]
First, we perfected
the hammock.
And, Rachel, how much
is the contraption?
So, this is the brand?new
hammock throne.
This is our high?end
hanging solution
that we've just
introduced.
That's your product?
This is the first of many.
You made this?
Demin:
Yeah, we designed it.
Yeah, we did!
[ Laughs ]
So, this one is somewhere in
the neighborhood of $2,200.
?Yeah.
?Whoa!
?Wow.
But it's an indoor piece
of furniture.
See, that seems like a lot.
Tell us the story
of how you got started,
why you're here.
Connors: Yeah!
Our inspiration
to start this
was to literally end poverty
in really vulnerable communities
in the developing world.
The idea for the company
started when I initially
and I came home to Rachel.
I was thrilled that
my boyfriend...
[ Laughs ]
...wanted to quit
his finance job
and start a hammock company,
as you can imagine.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.
I was literally ??
"Yeah, honey, great idea!"
[ Chuckles ]
What are your sales?
This year, we're gonna
hit $1.3 million.
Wow.
Last year,
we did $860,000.
Your sales are
primarily online?
It's about 50/50 between
a combination of
direct?to?consumer sales
through our website,
as well as
strategic partnerships.
A big part
of our early wholesale
was kind of scattershot
patio stores.
We took a step back
from that
to focus on
strategic partnerships.
Who?
It's Virgin Voyages,
which is Virgin's
new cruise line business.
Yep. So, Virgin Voyages
will be putting
Yellow Leaf Hammocks in
every single balcony
of every single cabin.
What price do you get
from them for these?
They pay
our wholesale price,
Joe and Rachel...
Yes?
...here is my offer.
Herjavec: Bam!
Out of the five Sharks here,
I probably have
the most credentials
about building socially
impactful businesses.
So I understand
the challenges you're facing.
I really love a lot
of what you stand for,
but you have
$100,000 profit
with a crazy
$5.7 million valuation.
So my offer is as follows,
and it's an explosive offer.
I want 33%
of the company...
Yowza!
...and I'll give you
$1 million.
What?!
Wow.
Say yes or no,
and then it's done.
Rachel and Joe
are seeking $400,000
for a 7% stake in their
mission?based hammock company,
Yellow Leaf Hammocks.
Daniel is interested
and has made a staggering offer.
What?!
I want 33%
of the company...
O'Leary: Yowza!
...and I'll give you
$1 million.
Herjavec: What?!
Say yes or no,
and then it's done.
O'Leary: Whoa!
$1 million, 33%.
Demin: We ?? The reason ??
Connors: Wait. Actually ??
Can I explain to you
the reasoning that ??
Demin: You ??
You mentioned our profitability
on last year.
I want to mention our
profitability on this year
and what we're doing next year,
to be fair to us.
Yeah, but that's a little
wishful thinking, right?
And I think you wo??
No, 'cause they got
the order.
Go ahead.
Connors: Yeah.
So, on the $1.3 million
that we're doing this year,
we're doing
$360,000 in profit.
One of the biggest things
that we're looking to do
with this money
is we have a huge
product road map of solutions.
Rachel, stop talking
and take the deal!
So we started here.
He's paying you
over eight times ??
Why? There might
be another deal.
Cuban: Good for you.
That's an amazing offer.
We also recognize
that we might not need
all of that money right now.
Oh!
No!
Well, we also might not ??
What are you doing?
Well, we might not ??
O'Leary: Oh!
Alright, well, hey,
if you don't need all
the money right now...
Good for you, Joe.
Good for you.
...I'm gonna make you an offer.
Want to hear my offer?
We don't ?? We're not
prepared to give away
that much of our company.
[ Sharks groaning ]
Greiner:
Do you want to hear my offer?
?Listen to Lori.
?Alright.
Ohh.
Oh!
I mean,
I sit here, I listen.
?Oh!
?I watch ??
It's a hammock company!
Demin: It's not enough.
Well, listen, he just said
maybe he doesn't need
all that much money.
So I will give you an offer.
I'll go $400,000 for 20%.
[ Chuckles ]
Now, granted,
his might be a better
offer for you.
$1 million for the 25%
and both of you.
I don't want to go
to the million.
How about
$500,000 for 25%?
No.
No, that dilutes ??
Lubetzky:
What is your counter?
For 25%?
$600,000 for 14%.
Oh, wow.
Ugh!
Herjavec: I love the idea,
and I think you guys
are the real deal.
Thank you.
I will give you
the $400,000 for 15%.
Lubetzky: If you take
the million dollars from me,
you won't need to dilute
yourselves again.
You might.
You know how much money
Kind has raised
in its entire lifetime
for the business?
The total we ever raised
in our entire history
was $5.2 million, and we sell
over $1 billion in sales.
I'll teach you,
and I'll help you
run the business
in an efficient way.
Are you okay with 33%,
or is that too much for you?
I think it's too much
because ??
What's the maximum
that you're willing to do
for someone that's gonna
really roll up their sleeves
and help you?
We're looking
at the future.
If you took 33% now,
I worry that we would ??
it would hurt us at
a subsequent round when we grow.
Why?
What subsequent round?
Greiner:
When I started my business,
started with one product,
I took out a bank loan,
it was about $325,000.
I paid it back within a year,
and I never had to take a loan
or bring in
an investor again.
So listen, I don't think
you need to just sit there
and take on
all these investors
and take in
a whole ton of money.
You just need to be
strategically smart
and take in
the right investor.
But you need somebody.
That's the bottom line.
So I'm gonna
change my offer.
My offer is this ??
I'm gonna go $200,000 flat,
then I'm gonna give you
a loan of $200,000 at 7%,
I'm going to fund purchase
orders if you need them,
and I'm going to ask for 17%.
I just offered you
$400,000 for 15% first.
You may not like it,
you may not,
but the one thing
that I can offer is,
is I can offer somebody
who will hold your hand,
take you down the road,
do everything that you need.
Lori.
I care about helping women,
I care about
helping environment,
I care about helping the world,
and I really like
the two of you,
so I care about helping you.
I <i>love</i>
the two of you.
Lori, thank you so much.
Love you guys.
We love you guys.
Focus, Joe.
Would you do...?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
Would you do
$1 million for 25%?
