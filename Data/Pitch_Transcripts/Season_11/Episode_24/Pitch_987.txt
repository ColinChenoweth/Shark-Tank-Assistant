You made this?
Demin:
Yeah, we designed it.
Yeah, we did!
[ Laughs ]
So, this one is somewhere in
the neighborhood of $2,200.
?Yeah.
?Whoa!
?Wow.
But it's an indoor piece
of furniture.
See, that seems like a lot.
Tell us the story
of how you got started,
why you're here.
Connors: Yeah!
Our inspiration
to start this
was to literally end poverty
in really vulnerable communities
in the developing world.
The idea for the company
started when I initially
$1 million, 33%.
Demin: We ?? The reason ??
Connors: Wait. Actually ??
Can I explain to you
the reasoning that ??
Demin: You ??
You mentioned our profitability
on last year.
I want to mention our
profitability on this year
and what we're doing next year,
to be fair to us.
No, 'cause they got
the order.
Go ahead.
Connors: Yeah.
So, on the $1.3 million
that we're doing this year,
we're doing
$360,000 in profit.
One of the biggest things
that we're looking to do
with this money
is we have a huge
product road map of solutions.
Good for you, Joe.
Good for you.
...I'm gonna make you an offer.
Want to hear my offer?
We don't ?? We're not
prepared to give away
that much of our company.
[ Sharks groaning ]
Greiner:
Do you want to hear my offer?
?Listen to Lori.
?Alright.
Ohh.
Oh!
I mean,
I sit here, I listen.
?Oh!
?I watch ??
It's a hammock company!
Demin: It's not enough.
Well, listen, he just said
maybe he doesn't need
all that much money.
So I will give you an offer.
I'll go $400,000 for 20%.
[ Chuckles ]
Now, granted,
his might be a better
offer for you.
Focus, Joe.
Would you do...?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
Would you do
$1 million for 25%?
