Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tara Williams,
Tara, um, you're, like,
an incredible inspiration.
Thank you.
You're, like,
why America
is the amazing
country it is.
Aww. Yeah.
Like, you're down
with your luck,
Yeah, Tara, I mean,
the fact that you
started when you did ??
I started my first company
after I got fired, you know?
Tara, you must be
out of your mind.
No.
So that could be us.
What if we're on track
to do $90 million?
20% of $90 million?
That's a lot of money.
I don't think you
slept enough last night.
It's a great deal, Lori.
[ Laughs ]
It's a great deal.
I came here offering
a discount,
Tara, listen, I really did not
want to go under my 25%.
I thought that was fair.
I thought it was good.
Um, I will meet you
halfway.
I will go 22.5%.
