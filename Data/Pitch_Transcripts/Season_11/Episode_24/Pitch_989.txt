Hi, Sharks.
This is Ryan O. Cunningham,
chef and co?founder
of RollinGreens.
People call him Chef Ko.
And this is my wife,
Lindsey Cunningham,
and she is our CEO
and co?founder of RollinGreens.
We are from
Boulder, Colorado,
women?owned,
and seeking $500,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Sharks, right here
is an underutilized,
underrated ancient whole grain
called millet.
We've revolutionized
the classic tot
and created
a nutrient?dense alternative
the whole family loves
and trusts.
And we're not just
stopping at millet.
We just launched
our cauliflower wings,
which are a direct
meat replacement.
And we have many
more products on the way,
which make the home chef
the hero.
This is not plant?based food
made in a lab.
This is real food
from a real chef.
Food truck favorites
for our generation.
So, who wants to help
take the wheel with us
at RollinGreens
and lead the tasty,
clean?food revolution?
Now let's eat.
?Yay.
?Yeah, let's try it.
Alright, guys, so excited
to feed you here today.
Sir.
?Thank you, sir.
?Thank you so much.
I'm giving you guys all a little
product box, as well, here.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you.
?Sir. Enjoy.
"Finger?lickin', no chicken."
?Oh, yeah.
?Exactly.
So, you have three tots.
You have our
OG original tots,
you have our
Italian herb, and then ??
Herjavec: So,
this is the original.
It is, yep.
And that's dipped in
a little ketchup.
They're meant
to be dipped.
They hold crispy,
never get soggy.
Then we have wings.
So, spicy green buffalo.
Your sauces
are delicious.
Thank you. So, those were
our food truck favorites
that Ryan created
from our food truck days.
We did that for about
five and a half years.
Millet tots were
a top?selling appetizer
on our food truck.
Wow.
Didn't exist
in the marketplace,
so we launched
with those.
Thank you, Lori.
They're the only
non?potato whole?grain tot
on the market.
This stuff is spectacular.
It's delicious.
Good. Thank you.
Thank you.
What does it cost?
So, $4.99 retail
for the millet tots,
and the wings, we just
launched four weeks ago.
Those are coming in
at around $6.99 a bag,
and they're flying
off the shelves.
And what does it
cost you to make?
So, about $1.70,
and we're selling them
right now for $3.11.
So, what are the sales
of the millet tots
over the last
three years?
So, most of our sales
to date are off one SKU,
which is our OG,
our original tot.
Last year, we ended the year
at $320,000 in sales.
On one SKU?
That was basically ??
On one SKU.
And this year?
So, this year,
we're projected to
end the year around 700K.
Why do you think
you're gonna accelerate?
Because the commitments
we have going forward.
So, we just launched
in Super Targets
all over the country.
Kroger is our biggest
retailer to date.
Give me 2018 top line,
profit or loss 2018.
2018, 320K.
Okay.
Loss, 200K.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean,
we're in high?growth mode.
And what about 2019?
What about 2019?
2019,
we'll end around 700K,
and we'll probably
lose around 300.
?Ooh.
?2020, $5.5 million,
we have our revenue
projected to be.
What are you gonna do
with the money?
Because with the kind of losses
you're projecting,
you'll need the $500,000
just to stay in cash flow.
Yeah. Well ??
So, are you planning
to raise this $500,000
and then raise more
in the next short term?
Yes, we are.
Okay, so tell us about that.
So, the use of funds
for this round
are really, number one,
to support our retail growth.
You know,
launching in Target...
Right.
...and all these
big?box retailers, it's costly.
But ultimately, we don't want to
just have frozen products.
We see ourselves in
shelf?stable and refrigerated.
So, about 30 products
over the next three years.
How much
are you gonna raise?
About $2 million.
Your food is delicious.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
When things are tasty,
people come.
I'm not intimidated
by your business.
Look,
my Bantam Bagels came in
with one little
stuffed bagel ball.
Yep.
So there is some
sympatico here.
But I also would like
to have a partner here
in my fellow Shark, Daniel.
You're being so mean.
Lori, I can't do this.
I'm not being mean.
Well, I mean, your
whole philosophy is clean food
for the next generation.
This is exactly
what we're doing.
I'd love to help
you guys out,
but I can't save
every venture.
It's gonna take ??
And that's okay.
It's, like, we've been
through the challenges
and we've sustained,
and that's who we are.
We execute.
I'm a little pistol.
He's Chef Ko.
But, no, you need
to be more focused.
You can't do everything.
You seem to say
you're listening.
Sir, I almost disagree.
We are so laser?focused
that we just launched
our cauliflower wings.
We've been three years,
tots, demos, every day.
Yeah.
You keep on making a point,
and you don't take
your own advice, right?
You keep on coming up
with these options on expansion
that are just gonna consume
more cash.
Well, we're also
switching gears.
So, food service,
where the margin's better.
There you go!
That's exactly the point!
Food service
is gonna kill you.
You understand how hard it is
to get into food service?
Yes!
That worries me,
I have to say.
I mean, Daniel,
I appreciate ??
Lindsey, please do not go
into food service yet.
We just landed
a huge account.
Just 'cause you land an account
doesn't mean it's good.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
What's your wholesale
price for the tots?
$3.11.
Okay, so, what's
your margin on the ??
So, right now,
that's around 35%.
Alright, guys, I'm out.
[ Laughs ]
?Mark, come back in.
?Aw!
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
I appreciate you, man.
The bottom line is
the business model doesn't work
because your margins
have to be...
Cuban: A lot higher.
...close to 50%
to break even.
Yeah.
I see clouds.
You see clouds?
What kind of clouds?
I see clouds.
I see some bad things
are gonna happen to you.
No ??
Mr. Wonderful!
I'm out.
Oh?ho?ho!
Thank you.
That's ?? Aw.
No way. Are we hav??
You said, "No, thank you"?
I'm sorry. Look, I got
to tell you the truth.
You're out? What do you think
bad's gonna happen?
I think you're gonna
go out of business.
Lindsey, I am so tired
of everybody beating you up
up here for
the opportunity.
I get it.
You're all over the map.
You've got to slow down
a little bit.
?Yep. Yep.
?But they taste great.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I have done really well
in 11 years on this show
by investing in great people.
You guys are great people.
I believe the mission.
It's the stuff in between
I'm stuck with.
Yeah.
I'll give you
the $500,000 for 20%.
Oh, if you don't say yes,
you're crazy.
Will you come back in to ??
No!
No, stop.
Will you two
come in together?
There's nothing
wrong with that.
[ Laughter ]
You're absolutely right.
There's nothing
wrong with that.
There's nothing
wrong with that.
You'll have to lose
the deal.
You two are masterminds.
?Wow.
?You can ask whatever you want.
I can offer ??
Not if he's gonna stay in.
You had nothing,
and I made you an offer,
and now you want
another Shark in?
Okay, Robert,
how do you think ??
Lindsey, if you don't want me
in the deal,
I'm happy to ??
No, of course I want you
in the deal.
We love you.
We love you.
But your answer was you
want me to bring Lori in.
