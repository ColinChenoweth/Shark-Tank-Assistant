Hi, Sharks.
This is Ryan O. Cunningham,
that Ryan created
from our food truck days.
Lindsey, please do not go
into food service yet.
Lindsey, I am so tired
of everybody beating you up
up here for
the opportunity.
I get it.
You're all over the map.
You've got to slow down
a little bit.
?Yep. Yep.
?But they taste great.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I have done really well
in 11 years on this show
by investing in great people.
You guys are great people.
I believe the mission.
It's the stuff in between
I'm stuck with.
Yeah.
I'll give you
the $500,000 for 20%.
Oh, if you don't say yes,
you're crazy.
Will you come back in to ??
No!
No, stop.
Will you two
come in together?
There's nothing
wrong with that.
[ Laughter ]
You're absolutely right.
There's nothing
wrong with that.
There's nothing
wrong with that.
You'll have to lose
the deal.
You two are masterminds.
?Wow.
?You can ask whatever you want.
I can offer ??
Not if he's gonna stay in.
Lindsey, if you don't want me
in the deal,
I'm happy to ??
No, of course I want you
in the deal.
We love you.
We love you.
But your answer was you
want me to bring Lori in.
