Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tara Williams,
and this is my husband,
Rob Williams,
and I'm here today
seeking $100,000
in exchange for
10% equity in my company,
Dreamland Baby.
Sharks, as a mom of four,
I know better than anyone
there isn't a sound in the world
worse than a crying baby.
[ Baby crying ]
[ Groans ]
With babies waking up
every few hours,
the amount of uninterrupted
sleep parents get...
[ Laughter ]
...can sometimes feel like
bare to none.
?Ah!
?And that is no way
to function through life.
But, Sharks, that's exactly
what we were doing.
When our son Luke was
nearly 6 months old,
he was still waking up
every hour and a half.
Oh, wow.
When I say nobody was sleeping,
I mean nobody.
Not me.
[ Chuckles ]
Definitely not me.
That is until I created this ??
Dreamland Baby,
a weighted blanket sleep sack
designed to help your baby
feel calm, fall asleep faster,
and stay asleep longer.
The gentle weight increases
both serotonin and melatonin,
naturally reducing stress
and increasing relaxation
through deep touch stimulation.
The first night our son
wore his Dreamland Baby,
he went from waking up
every hour and a half
to sleeping 12 hours ??
through the entire night.
It was an absolute
game changer for our family.
So, who wants to join me
and make that dream a reality?
Wow.
Do we have them?
You have samples
in front of you.
Herjavec: Oh.
Okay.
Robert and Lori,
you have a size small,
which is for
zero to 6 months.
And the other three gentlemen
have a medium, 6 to 12.
Tara, um, you're, like,
an incredible inspiration.
Thank you.
You're, like,
why America
is the amazing
country it is.
Aww. Yeah.
Like, you're down
with your luck,
you and your husband both,
one after another,
lose your jobs.
You turned that around,
you turned a crisis
into an opportunity,
and you're building something
really, really compelling.
I don't think I'm the right
Shark to help you here.
I think there's people
that know far more than I
about the space,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
I appreciate it.
Yeah, Tara, I mean,
the fact that you
started when you did ??
I started my first company
after I got fired, you know?
And when your back's
against the wall, you know,
if you have that
entrepreneurial spirit,
you always find a way.
Yeah.
And for this product,
it's a great
niche product, right?
I don't see this as being
a big enough business
for me to invest in.
So for those reasons,
I'm out, but congratulations.
I think it's
a phenomenal product.
Thank you. Yeah.
And so I think you're
gonna do just fine.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Congrats.
Greiner: Listen, one of
the most important
but I think wonderful things
about our country
is one idea
can change your life.
Yeah.
So...
I feel that you've
done everything right,
but I know the road
you have to toe.
Absolutely.
Okay?
And I believe you can make it,
but I know the amount of work
that has to go into it...
Yeah.
...and it's a boatload.
But I'm gonna
make you an offer.
My thought is that it might be
extremely helpful for you
to license this to somebody
who is in the business
of either manufacturing
baby products
Tara, you must be
out of your mind.
No.
So that could be us.
What if we're on track
to do $90 million?
20% of $90 million?
That's a lot of money.
I don't think you
slept enough last night.
It's a great deal, Lori.
[ Laughs ]
It's a great deal.
I came here offering
a discount,
and you got double
what I'm asking?
You're winning.
It's a great deal.
Let's do this, Lori.
Tara, listen, I really did not
want to go under my 25%.
I thought that was fair.
I thought it was good.
Um, I will meet you
halfway.
I will go 22.5%.
