?Oh!
?Whoa.
Yeah.
I'm going to sleep.
Good night.
And yes, please say goodbye
so he can get
some real rest.
Greiner: Buh?bye.
Good luck, Dad.
Sleep well.
So, the beads inside, they're
called poly pellet beads.
So, the same thing that's
inside of a beanie bag.
They're little beads
of plastic?
Yes, yes.
And they are completely safe.
They're non?toxic,
they're food?grade.
So, it's a sleep sack
with beads?
Correct.
And why is it better
than every other
sleep sack I've used?
And there are a lot of
sleep sacks on the market.
There are a <i>lot</i>
of sleep sacks.
And I know that you
have seen them
and used them
with your kids.
Well, with the beads, too?
None with beads.
I definitely love
heavy blankets.
Yeah.
I sleep much better
than when they're thin.
I've never heard of this.
Is there scientific research,
or it's just obvious to you,
and it's just your logic?
Yeah.
No. I mean,
first, as a mom ??
I would love to share my story,
if I could start there.
Yes, please tell us
about you.
Please.
Please do.
So, the invention
of Dreamland Baby,
it started,
um, on March 29, 2018.
?Uh?huh.
?Can you be more specific?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Well, this is why.
That was the day we had
a scheduled induction
for our son Luke.
Now, the day before,
my husband got laid off
from his job of 15 years,
so that was devastating for us.
Two months
into my maternity leave,
I was also laid off.
We were like, "Oh, my gosh.
What are we gonna do now?
We have four kids 5 and under,
we have no income...
?Wow.
?...and we have this baby
who's relentlessly waking up."
There was a day that
I was driving in the car,
and I nearly got
in a car accident.
I was with my four kids.
And I remember pulling over
and just tears streaming down
my eyes,
and I was crying, saying,
"I need a solution."
Like, "God, please help me."
That very night,
we had the older kids in bed,
and we had a heavy
throw blanket on our couch.
We laid it on top of Luke,
and I just saw this calm
immediately come over
his face.
A light bulb went off
in my head, and I thought,
"He needs a weighted blanket."
Yeah.
So I thought,
"Absolutely,
there must be one
for babies."
And I couldn't believe
there wasn't.
So, my mother?in?law sewed
our first prototype,
and then the first night
he wore it,
he slept for 12 hours.
Wow.
We thought,
"This has got to be a fluke."
But next night, 12 hours.
It was so immediate that ??
So you know
this thing's working.
Absolutely. It was just,
"Oh, my gosh. Okay."
So it was a mother's intuition
combined with,
"Now there's got to be
science behind it."
So, my background,
I come from
the medical?device space.
I've been there
over 10 years
in sales
and market?development roles.
Oh, interesting.
So I speak and think
clinical trials.
There had been a clinical
trial that was published
in October of 2018,
so I've actually now partnered
with them,
and the woman who, um,
published the study
had actually helped me
with some early designs.
And so we know that it's safe.
Good for you.
Thank you.
Where did you get the money
to pay for this?
So ?? [ Chuckles ]
When my husband and I
were both laid off,
we had no money coming in.
It was a desperate situation.
But when I was
on maternity leave,
in the State of California,
they pay you a stipend
for being on maternity leave.
So, I had $14,000 that wasn't
in our joint account.
It was in this other account.
So that's actually
the money I used to start it.
Don't say that out loud.
[ Laughs ]
I know. Shh!
Don't tell my husband.
You mean your husband
didn't know
you were spending
the $14,000?
That's why you asked
him to leave?
Well, he didn't really
know it was there,
'cause it was in
another account.
[ Laughter ]
So, yes, there was
an interesting conversation
when, all of a sudden, he said,
"What is this account?"
So, essentially, you took
the maternity?leave money
from the company
that fired you
to start this business,
and, boom shakalaka, right?
Yeah.
Pretty much, yeah, so...
?Shakalaka is right.
?Boom shakalaka.
I used that first money
for the patent pending
and then also to
get prototypes made.
Where are you selling?
How much are you selling?
Yeah.
What do you
sell them for?
Okay, so, year to date,
we're at just about $30,000.
?Ooh.
?Ugh.
We did a ??
That's not bad.
Go ahead.
We did a Kickstarter
the month of June,
raised about $25,000.
So, of that $30,000, $25,000
is from Kickstarter.
Was the Kickstarter.
And my website has been live
for three weeks.
How much do you
sell it for?
$79.
What does it cost you
to make?
The small is gonna be,
um, $13.60,
and the medium
is gonna be $12.20.
?Cost?
?Yeah.
This isn't a company yet.
It's a product.
Mm?hmm.
You got a world of
challenge ahead here.
It's a great product
that's not investable yet.
Go make a model
that you can come to
an investor like me and say,
"Look, give me $1 million,
and I'll get $10 million
in sales."
That's interesting.
This is not interesting.
I'm sorry, I can't go on
the journey with you, Tara.
I'm out.
Alright, I ??
Thank you for that.
I appreciate it.
or in the baby arena.
So, um, really what I would
do is, say, $100,000,
but I would do it for...
uh...
I'd do it for 25%.
But my goal is to find you
a licensing deal.
I?I?I understand it.
I also just want
to be fair to Robert.
Robert?
Well, you know, as Daniel said,
I love your story.
I love how
you've gotten here.
I congratulate you.
I've been through
the crying babies,
and now they're these
amazing almost?toddlers.
For me to put up with
a crying baby,
there's got to be
a great return.
?Right.
?Your business is at
the crying?baby stage.
I'm not sure the return
is big enough right now
in the route
that you're going.
So I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Lori ??
What do you want to do?
That is a great offer,
but I do have to counter.
I'm not liking you
as much anymore.
Oh, I'm liking you more.
I'm liking you more.
So, I would like to counter
for the same deal,
but at 20% instead of 25%.
Hmm.
[ Laughs ]
?Good luck with that.
?Congratulations, Tara.
Alright, guys, thank you.
Cuban: Thanks, Tara.
Congratulations.
And I'm Anthony, but you can
call me Mohammed, too.
We're from ??
[ Laughter ]
We're from
Bloomington, Indiana ??
Waaah!
Go Hoosiers! Yes.
...seeking $60,000
and marketing expertise
in exchange for 10%
of our business.
When you shower
with traditional soap,
you're actually slathering
animal fat all over your body.
[ Laughs ]
As Muslims who happen
to be vegans,
we don't eat meat
and hated the idea
of "cleaning" ourselves
with animal fat.
So that's why we created
our company, The Mad Optimist,
a totally unique,
different, radical,
customizable soap
and body?care company.
gluten?free,
and cruelty?free.
Yay!      Yay!
[ Chuckles ]
Here's how it works.
You simply
go to our website
and choose the type of product
you'd like to make.
Let's say
you choose soap.
Then you pick your
essential?oil scents.
Together:
[ Inhale deeply ] Ahh!
And you even get to pick
add?ins, like spirulina,
coconut milk,
or activated charcoal.
And to continue the fun,
you can pick your
packaging design
and name your soap
anything you want.
And, Sharks, for the very first
time in "Shark Tank" history,
you're gonna hear something
you've never heard before.
We have
a sliding price scale.
[ Laughs ]
That's right!
A sliding price scale.
Where customers can choose
how much they pay
for their products.
So for customers who can afford
to pay a little bit more,
it offsets the cost
for customers who need to pay
a little bit less.
We are crazy about doing
good in this world.
We run our business
very differently,
and that's because everything
that we do is deeply rooted
in transparency,
integrity, and kindness.
So, Sharks, which
one of you is a...
Together: Mad optimist?!
[ Sharks laugh ]
So, we pre?placed
customized gifts
for each of you in front of you.
?Alright!
?Oh, thank you. Thank you.
?Yeah.
And each box has a custom soap,
custom lip balm,
custom bath soak,
and custom spray,
each designed just for you,
named for you.
This stuff
smells delicious.
Thank you.            Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Guys, this deal where
I design my own bar of soap,
I mean, are you
actually making
individual
soap bars for each order?
Can I smell yours,
Daniel?
?Yeah, we are. Yes. Yep.
?Yep.
?Why?
?To Kevin's point,
what are the economics?
Duncan: Sure.
Uh, so, soap is our
most popular product.
It's about 80% of what we've
sold so far with the custom.
The cost for that
is about $4.50 per bar,
and, uh, like we said,
it's a sliding scale.
So you can choose anywhere
from about $6 to about $16.
So, uh, $8.50 is the average,
and then ??
You mean I can choose
how much I pay you for it?
?Yep.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
?And we have a ??
?His brain is about to blow up.
So, you know, why we do that,
Mr. Wonderful, is we want ??
Why?
We want everyone
to afford our body care.
Please help me understand
this madness.
See, we feel like
this is a premium product,
and we want everyone
to afford it.
You're averaging
the median?
You're in the middle,
right?
?Absolutely.
?Yeah. Yeah.
And what's your
profit margin in the middle?
So, the profit margin
in the middle is about 50%.
50%?
Anthony, how long have
you been doing it?
With The Mad Optimist brand,
it's been about 11 months.
Alright, the last 11 months,
what are your sales, and what ??
So, last 11 months
with The Mad Optimist,
it's been about $21,000.
And I do want
to add in that ??
[ Chuckles ]
$21,000?
That's it?
?Don't laugh.
?Well, that kind of reflects
our back end.
?I'm trying to be optimistic.
I'm trying to be
optimistic.
No, no, no. Absolutely.
Sure, sure.
Mohammed A.:
Absolutely. Absolutely.
O'Leary: In 11 months,
you've sold $21,000?
Of custom soap.
And I do
want to add in ??
What are
your total sales?
Our sales have been,
uh, $97,000 year to date.
Do you ever go home
at night and say,
"What is
the meaning of life?"
[ Laughter ]
Every night.
Every night, we do. We do.
It's a good question
to ask ourselves.
Guys, tell us
the evolution.
Yeah.
Right.
How you got here,
who you are.
There's been a bit of
a transition.
Yeah. Thank you, Mark.
Why?
Well, I guess at
the very beginning,
the three of us started selling
at farmers' markets,
shows, stores,
and throughout Indiana,
and then fast forward
five years, we ??
?Five years?
?Yeah.
Herjavec: You did that
for five years?
Yeah, first few years ??
How much soap did you sell
in that five years?
Uh, we sold ??
So, it's $800,000
in total since the beginning.
And the beginning
was what year?
In five years?
Five years ??
It's seven years now.
Mohammed A.: No, no, no.
Guys, what do you actually do?
What are your real jobs?
Well, this is our job,
and we've been working
really hard
to make it happen.
You don't have
any other job?
No.
Do you eat any protein?
[ Laughter ]
Do you eat anything?
How do you pay yourself?
We've used up some savings,
and then family's been
helping us out...
Mohammed A.: Yeah.
'cause everyone really believes
in what we're doing.
And the other question is
why are you optimistic?
[ Laughter ]
You have no reason
to be optimistic.
Half the time, they're mad,
half the time,
they're optimistic.
The definition of insanity
is doing the same thing
over and over again
and expecting
a different outcome.
But they already told you
they're insane.
O'Leary:
There's no growth.
You're hand?making bars
and doing $21,000.
No, that's just the soap.
We also do
wholesale that ??
Okay, look.
I?I?I tried
to be optimistic.
There is nothing here
for an investor.
And also your parents
must be asking
when you're gonna
wake up and get jobs.
I'm out.
Well, thank you
for your time.
Thank you
for your time.
By the way, the energy that
oozes out of every one of you
and out of your
packaging is awesome.
?Thank you, thank you.
?There's so much
vibrant, beautiful energy.
But you have
a long ways to go.
You're way too obsessed
about your mission,
and you're not letting
the product shine through.
I think you have
a very long journey
to figure
a lot of stuff out.
Best of luck.
I'm out.
Greiner: I couldn't love
the three of you more.
You are fun,
you have purpose...
Thank you.
...and you are good to the core.
But this isn't the business.
I would be so in
because of you.
But because the business
isn't going to get you there,
I truly am pained
to say I'm out.
Mohammed plural, Anthony,
I really love your energy,
but I could not hate
your business more.
The open market does not
reward good intention.
It rewards results.
Three great guys
with a mad business.
I'm out.
You have to understand
how different we are.
We have our revenue numbers
live on our website.
You go to our website,
you place your order,
you'll see that
number increment.
You are so obsessed
with all the coolness
of running a business.
Eventually, you got to
run a business!
And we are. And we ??
You've been in business
for seven years.
What's the product?!
Sell something!
Our product is
customized body care,
and ?? which no one else is
doing out there.
Exactly, and you don't ?? you
don't properly celebrate that.
You don't ??
What matters is that
the world becomes
a better place to live.
The world cannot become
a better place to live
if you don't contribute to it.
that Anthony, Mohammed,
and Mohammed are losing sight
of the business of their
mission?based body?care company,
The Mad Optimist.
Mohammed M.: What matters
is that the world
becomes a better place
to live.
The world cannot become
a better place to live
if you don't contribute to it.
We're not ??
See ??
We're not confused.
We have a plan.
We've done wholesale
and bulk custom.
You don't have a plan. You've
been doing it for seven years.
You pivot all the time.
Which is fine,
but you have no results.
Duncan:
We did one major pivot.
That's a hasty
generalization you made of us,
and that's not fair.
Custom is our
entryway.
This is our point of
differentiation.
No one is doing custom
bar soaps like we are.
So, what's next? What comes
after custom bar soap?
[ Sighs ]
So, I mean,
we already have
custom lip balms,
bath soaps.
We're adding on other
body care products, as well.
Would you be willing to have
multiple businesses?
In other words,
verticalizing?
So, when you first came in,
you started talking about,
you know, being Muslim,
and how, you know,
you have a different
orientation towards products.
Right?
Why not have a website
that focuses just
on that market?
Yes. Microsite.
Like a microsite. Yeah.
Yeah, microsite.
So, have you done that?
Um, not yet.
It's been one of our plans.
Cuban:
So, you would do it?
?Yes.
?Yeah.
Because ??
Mark, if you give
these money ??
Shut up, Kevin.
You give them money,
you're cursing them.
They're gonna stay
doing this.
[ Chuckles ]
This is horrible.
But what really caught
my attention
that I think
has not been done anywhere,
and you started to get
to this ??
showing your revenues.
Yeah.
Right?
Having the slider on price
so people can pick
your pricing, right?
Absolutely.
Now, typically,
these guys are all right ??
the mission can't
lead the way.
But sometimes when
a mission discloses
something unique
that's worth the effort,
then okay,
it's worth a flier,
particularly when
it's $60,000, right?
What's the unique
part here, Mark?
Sometimes it's just not
a good idea.
You ever thought of that?
No, and sometimes
it is a good idea.
I like the idea of being
totally transparent,
I like the idea
of having the slider,
pay what you can afford.
So, I'll make you the offer.
I'll give you the $60,000.
I'll help you with this,
but I want 25%.
Why don't you get 110%?
[ Chuckles ]
This is amazing.
[ Chuckles ]
Um...
No, I'm not gonna
negotiate.
Are you kidding?
You have nothing.
Uh?? um...
That ??
W?We love the offer.
So, we all have
equal partnerships, even ??
Now we all will.
Can you go down
to 18%?
No, it's got to be the 25%
because there's got to
be enough there where I ??
[ Groans ]
Okay,
I'll go down to 20%,
and I'll let you guys
convince on the 2%.
Wow.
Wow.
We would like
to do that.
However, there's one
contingency,
and that one contingency
is this is Ashura, and so...
?Today is the day.
?Basically, the first airing
of this episode,
we would like to donate,
uh, 100% of the proceeds
of this day.
That's your choice.
That's fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, well, then great!
Let's do it.
[ Laughter, cheering ]
Thanks, guys. Congratulations.
Appreciate it.
Thank you very much, Mark.
Appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Alright.
?Congrats, guys.
?Anthony.
Thank you, Sharks.
[ Sighs ]
Whoo!
Oh, my gosh!
When they gave away
100% of the sales
on "Shark Tank" night...
Yep.
...their biggest night ever,
it will guarantee that
this business
never, ever, ever
makes any money.
So I think you've done
a horrible thing here.
You've left them
in a curse.
They're trapped in a business
that will never profit.
See, that's the difference
between you and I, Kevin.
No, I am right.
You are wrong.
He's gonna coach them.
I am the side of light.
You're on the side of darkness.
You've put them
into Hell.
See, Kevin ??
Not only Hell.
No, that's not true.
The third level of Hell
where they make soap
one bar at a time.
Kevin, I have total
confidence in my ability
to make them successful.
I know you don't
have that ability.
I have plenty of ability,
but that business doesn't work.
By your logic, almost
none of us would be here.
No.
No, seven years!
The market has spoken!
Because by your logic,
we couldn't pivot!
It took me 10 years
in the wilderness
before I figured out ??
But you were growing!
I am so not worried.
Greiner: The best thing in the
world to me as an entrepreneur
is that one idea can
truly change your life.
Cramsey: I came on "Shark Tank"
to make a difference.
I wasn't just representing
my family farm,
but family farms
all across America,
and now I have become
their voice.
Student debt is
really a national crisis.
Student loan debt
is affecting
over 44 million Americans
in this country.
It's our mission to
help future students
pay that debt off
as soon as possible.
You're now official licensees
of the National Football League.
O'Leary: Remember,
entrepreneurship is not
a destination ??
it's a journey.
Narrator: We learned from
new guest Sharks
from all walks of life.
One of the secret ingredients
of America is our belief
in the entrepreneurial system
and the ability for us
to be able to foster this power.
Sharapova:
I like the attitude that
so many entrepreneurs have
that come on the show.
It's this "I won't give up
until I get what I want."
That is the American dream,
that there is no finish line
to what they do.
Lake: What I love about
entrepreneurship
is the optimism.
You're believing in something
that lots of people
don't believe in
and taking a point of view
that's not a common
point of view.
Wojcicki: My primary advice
for entrepreneurs
who are just starting out
is ride the ride, stick to it,
because you can overcome
almost anything.
Narrator: Our entrepreneurs
changed their lives
and the lives of others.
Heath: We wanted to have
an impact in the community,
but we had no idea
that it would turn into
the movement that it is today.
We've done over $225 million
in revenue
and donated over 30 million
pairs of socks to those in need.
Cheek: "Shark Tank"
put Everlywell on the map,
and now we're transforming
healthcare in America.
In just two years, we've done
$65 million in sales.
Goldman: Four years ago,
we were in a long audition line
for "Shark Tank,"
and we had no sales.
Today, we are dead set on being
a multibillion?dollar company
that helps everyone
to get good sleep.
Together: To the good life!
We've now done $175 million
in sales since "Shark Tank."
Judy: A lot of times,
we look at each other and go,
"You know what?
This is the American dream."
And we are so grateful
for it.
Tran: You can create
your own destiny.
You can create
anything you want.
As painful as it's been,
I promise you
it's gonna pay off.
[ All chanting
"Shark Tank! Shark Tank!" ]
"Shark Tank" makes
dreams come true.
This is proof of it.
?Hmm.
?That's what I think.
Now we've brought it
into your living room.
So, Sharks, who wants
to make the world a better place
and join us in our quest
to build a relaxation empire?
So, on the tables
in front of you
are specially selected
hammocks...
Oh.
...if you
open these up.
And first thing,
you want to look at the label.
They're all signed
by the women who made it.
We're a social
enterprise.
Cuban: I like that.
Yeah, they're all ??
Herjavec:
Where do you make them?
We work with moms
in rural Thailand
to create
high?wage jobs.
What do they cost?
What do you sell them for?
The ones that
we just gave you guys
are our classic double.
It's our
top?selling size.
They retail for $199.
?Ooh.
?That's not bad.
Our current line ranges
between $149 and $299.
The $199 hammock,
how much do you pay for it?
$44 is our landed cost.
So, what is an average
hammock made out of?
Something like this,
what does that cost?
You can find a hammock
for $30 on Amazon,
to be perfectly
honest.
You could also find it
for $400, you know?
It's not gonna
feel like this,
it's not gonna
look like this.
went on a backpacking trip
across southeast Asia.
Without me.
Aw!
[ Laughs ]
We were living together
in Boston at the time.
And I stumbled across
a hammock on a remote island,
and I was immediately struck
by how soft it was.
I was really impressed
with the quality,
and I started asking
them some questions
and learned that it was woven
by this hill tribe community.
It was part of
an economic development program
to help this hill tribe
group out of poverty,
and I was really struck
by that.
In Thailand?
In Thailand.
In Thailand, yeah.
So, I went to this community,
and I got to meet
the actual weavers
and hear their stories,
and I learned
that this community
that started
making the hammocks,
with the help
of an aid worker,
had been previously
in debt slavery,
and the thing
that really struck me
was a lot of people
kept coming to this community
asking to join
the program,
but they were being
turned away
because there weren't
enough sales.
And I thought, "Well, we can
start a little hammock company
and provide enough jobs
in this region."
So I came home with a backpack
stuffed full of hammocks,
but they'll also be,
um, retailing them.
So we'll be on
the room service menus
in the cabin
and on the stores.
The retail store
is projected
to more than double
our current business.
So, you've got to be
profitable then, right?
Last year,
on $860,000 in revenue,
our net income
was $110,000.
?That's great.
?After paying yourself?
After paying
ourselves, yeah.
We're making it
hard on them.
What's the minimum
percentage,
and what dollar
do you want?
Yeah.
