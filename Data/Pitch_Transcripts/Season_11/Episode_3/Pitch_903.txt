Hi, I'm Adelle.
And I'm Garrett.
We're from Austin, Texas,
and our company is Eterneva.
Eterneva provides
a soulful solution
to remembering our loved ones
in a positive way.
So, what we do
is grow real diamonds
from the carbon
in someone's ashes.
?Oh!
?What?
Hmm?
But really,
we're in the business
of celebrating
remarkable people.
Herjavec: Wow.
We're asking
for $600,000
in exchange
for 5% of our company.
?Wow.
?Whoa!
Let us show you
how this works.
This is about
a remarkable person,
someone full of hope
and joy.
By transforming their ashes
into a diamond,
you can celebrate
that special person.
Our diamonds give you
something positive
to look forward to.
At Eterneva,
we turn ashes to diamonds,
but really, we're eternalizing
remarkable people,
and this is how
you'll take them with you
on the rest
of life's adventures.
Wow.
I don't know what to think.
So, we'd like to show you
how it works.
So, this is
our welcome kit.
This is how
we start the process.
This is how somebody
will select their diamond,
and then their ashes
will come back in this kit.
It has be a cremation,
obviously,
or can you take
a piece of somebody
out of a coffin
and then ??
Oh, God, Ke??
I'm asking!
[ Laughter ]
So, how it works
is that we extract carbon
from 1/2 cup of ashes
or hair.
Or hair.
Archer: Correct.
I had no idea.
Once we have carbon
from either ashes or hair,
we then use high pressure,
high temperature
to grow a raw diamond.
Can we see it?
?Yeah, here's our kit.
?So, here's the kit.
This is how
you get started.
Yep.
Herjavec: And so what do I do
with this kit, then?
Yeah.
It's about
1/2 cup of ashes
that you put
into the kit.
Greiner: 1/2 cup?
?A little scoop.
?So, I take the ashes...
?Yep.
?[ Laughs ]
...I throw them
in here...
Cuban: Oh, Lord.
....and I courier this
back to you.
That's right. Absolutely.
Cuban: "Excuse me, Mom.
Give me the scooper."
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec:
So, once you get it,
what do you do with it,
then?
So, first, we're purifying
the ashes into carbon.
And how do you
purify it?
Um,
it's a high?heat process.
And then we go to growth.
We have machines that are
high?pressure, high?temperature.
How big are those machines?
Large refrigerator.
Yeah.
What's the capital cost
of a machine?
It will range.
It'll be between
$50,000 to $180,000.
When do I pay you?
Up front.
Yeah, up front, in full.
Smart.
Our prices range from
$3,000 to $20,000.
Okay.
Our average order value
is $8,000.
What does it cost you
to make that?
It'll be between, like,
$3,000 to $5,000.
How long from me sending you
the ashes or the hair
to me getting
the diamond back?
The end?to?end journey
takes about 10 months,
which seems like
a long time ??
?10 months?
?Seems like a long time.
However, what we've done
is we've created
a grief?changing journey
around this process.
So, you know, actually,
how we got into this,
Garrett and I originally
were just starting
a regular lab?grown
diamond company.
We saw this as
a super up?and?coming market,
you know, a lot of Millennials
are doing it.
And, so, we were
starting this company,
and then, uh,
around that time,
my business mentor
and one of my closest friends,
her name's Tracey Kaufman,
got diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer,
and within three months,
passed away.
Oh. Sorry.
And... [ Sighs ]
She didn't have any kids,
she didn't have a husband,
and so, um, the people
that she mentored, like me,
were effectively
her family.
And so that was actually
one of her wishes
was that each of us would get
a little bit of her ashes
and that we were allowed to do
something really meaningful
and really celebratory
for her.
That's sweet.
Oh, that's great.
Archer:
So, as a full customer,
I went to go
start this process
not, you know, thinking about,
"Oh, let's do this business,"
and I actually was
very turned off by
the experience.
It was really
transactional.
You know,
they were really cold.
And so I just
didn't feel comfortable
sending Tracey to them.
And so that was really
when Garrett and I
kind of came back,
and we put our business hats on,
and we said,
"Okay, customer experience
is everything,
and we know
how to do that.
You know,
we really could do this."
So, that's when we pivoted,
and now we're doing
3 1/2 times the volume
of all of our competitors
in a year and a half.
What about pets?
Pets is
a massive market.
Huh.
What are your sales?
So, our first year in sales,
we did $913,000.
Wow.
And we're projecting to do
$2.7 million this year.
And did you raise
any outside money?
Yeah, we raised
around $1.2 million round
at a $10 million
valuation.
Ohh, damn.
O'Leary: How much?
God, I loved the story
until that point.
Archer: So, we actually have
unbelievable investors.
They are all entrepreneurs
who have had
$200 million?plus exits.
Yeah, but that's
not even the point.
So, we wanted
strategic money
that joined
our cap table.
Guys, you come on here,
right,
knowing you're going
to have to negotiate,
but that puts a cap on what
you're able to negotiate.
O'Leary:
There's nothing proprietary
about what you're doing.
You're just very good
at how you package it up
and marketing it.
But frankly,
I could do this myself.
I can buy four machines
and bang out cat diamonds,
no problem.
See, that's the thing,
though,
is that's what
our competitors did,
and they fell
flat on their face.
John:
I'm a little skeptical,
and I think that
you have investors
that all have
$200 million exits.
Tens of thousands of people
apply to stand on this rug,
and every person
that takes this carpet
that has the money,
then they took
a chance away
from somebody
who desperately needed help.
that Adelle and Garrett
might not need an investment
for their diamonds?from?ashes
company, Eterneva.
John: Do you understand
where I'm seeing this
as a problem?
Cuban:
What he's asking you is
are you happy
with the commercial
that we're making for you
right now?
Archer: No.
I mean, seriously, guys,
our investors
are wonderful.
They're tech investors.
They aren't the people
who can help.
This is a household, you know,
branded experience,
and we need partners
that can help us
get in front of consumers
and introduce us to ??
Yeah.
But you already have
so much at your disposal.
I just don't see it.
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Greiner:
Let me jump in for a minute.
There's just
something for me about this
that just doesn't feel good
to me.
It doesn't feel right.
Um, so, I'm sorry, I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.
Cuban: Guys, look,
I love the idea.
You're a celebration company.
Whether it's death,
whether it's human,
whether it's pet,
whether it's birth,
I would've loved
to take a hair from my kids
when they were born
and put it in, you know,
a diamond
and give it to my wife
as a gift,
even if it took 10 months.
I actually love
what you're doing.
What I can't get my arms around
is how serious you are
about one of us
as an investor.
We're here to negotiate,
Mark.
Okay.
We would love to have you
on our team.
Well, then,
I'll make you an offer.
Mm?hmm.
$600,000 for 15%.
Archer: [ Laughs ]
I knew you guys
were smart.
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
Congratulations, man.
?Awesome.
?Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
It was impressive.
Archer: Now that Mark
is part of the team,
the sky
is the absolute limit
because we need people
behind us
that are helping us
make this an option
that absolutely
every person knows about
and don't regret not knowing
that this was an option,
and he's gonna get us there,
so we're so grateful.
