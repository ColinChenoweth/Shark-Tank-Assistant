Or hair.
Archer: Correct.
I had no idea.
Once we have carbon
from either ashes or hair,
we then use high pressure,
high temperature
to grow a raw diamond.
Can we see it?
?Yeah, here's our kit.
?So, here's the kit.
This is how
you get started.
Yep.
Archer:
So, as a full customer,
I went to go
start this process
not, you know, thinking about,
"Oh, let's do this business,"
Archer: So, we actually have
unbelievable investors.
They are all entrepreneurs
who have had
$200 million?plus exits.
Yeah, but that's
not even the point.
So, we wanted
strategic money
that joined
our cap table.
Guys, you come on here,
right,
knowing you're going
to have to negotiate,
but that puts a cap on what
you're able to negotiate.
O'Leary:
There's nothing proprietary
about what you're doing.
You're just very good
Archer: No.
I mean, seriously, guys,
our investors
are wonderful.
They're tech investors.
They aren't the people
who can help.
Archer: [ Laughs ]
I knew you guys
were smart.
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
Congratulations, man.
?Awesome.
?Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
It was impressive.
Archer: Now that Mark
is part of the team,
the sky
is the absolute limit
because we need people
behind us
that are helping us
make this an option
that absolutely
every person knows about
