of American
manufacturing.
Narrator: Showcasing America's
most ingenious products
and trend?setting ideas.
?There you go.
?[ Laughter ]
Narrator: Just when you think
you've seen it all,
there's always something new
coming in the Tank.
Which of these companies
will be the next big idea?
The future starts now.
It's alive!
Herjavec: Wow!
can help pay off
American student debt.
Narrator: Let's see
how they're doing now.
?Hi, welcome.
?Thanks for coming.
Patel:
We're here for this amazing
event called Tuition Paid
where Prep Expert and ChangEd
are collaborating
to teach high school
and college students
how to pay off college tuition
as effectively as possible.
Give it up
for Mark Cuban.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Cuban: 44 million people
have student debt
in this country
totaling more
than $1.5 trillion ??
that's a "T" ??
trillion dollars.
Any time we can give students
the best tools for success,
I want to be part of it.
The best return on investment
that you can have,
improving your test scores
to win scholarships.
Patel: The year that
I pitched on "Shark Tank,"
we had done $600,000
in sales.
3 1/2 years later,
we've done over
$20 million in sales.
Set it up once and let this run
in the background.
We round up
the spare change
and send it towards
your student loans
automatically.
When we pitched
on "Shark Tank,"
we only had
800 customers.
Today, we have
over 30,000 users.
30,000 users
means that we're now managing
over $1 billion
in student loan debt on ChangEd.
Cuban: The number?one rule
right now is,
what's a school
you can afford?
If you can't go
to a major university to start,
go to a community college
first.
Patel: Today, Mark showed us
he's not just our investor,
he's also our partner.
Solving the student loan
debt crisis
is just as important to him
as it is to Prep Expert
and ChangEd.
Thank you, Vegas.
You guys are great.
I'll be here all week.
[ Laughs ]
The day I paid off
my student loans
was one of the happiest days
of my life.
Student loan debt
is an incredible burden
not just on the students
that owe that money,
but on the entire economy.
With ChangEd and Prep Expert,
we can change that,
and I'm excited
for the impact they can have
on the entire country.
[ Cheering ]
So, I worked at companies
like American Express
managing
their mobile app.
When did you start
this business?
So, we actually did
a crowdfunding campaign
to get the funding
behind the research
and development
back in 2017.
You did a crowdfunding campaign
for the research?
Yes.
How much did you raise?
It was $32,000.
Greiner: That's brilliant.
Well, you had to deliver
a product, right?
Yeah, and we delivered
the product ??
so we pre?sold shirts
for that.
You're saying
you're worth $1.5 million.
That means
that you must have sold,
within the last year,
$800,000 worth
of product.
And?
So, uh, we've done $85,000
in gross revenue.
?That's it?
?That's it?
Yeah, because, uh, we're not
VC?backed or anything.
We had to put our own money
and reinvest into, uh ??
How much of your own money
have you put in?
About $35,000.
Maybe you're not worth
$1.5 million.
No, really?
Well, maybe
you're worth more.
Well, I never get upset
about crazy valuations
'cause I believe in the vision.
We've sold $32,000 worth
of inventory, so...
?Wow.
?Oh.
All off of
your website?
A little off
from the $800,000.
Right, but being
digital marketers,
we understand our customer,
we understand the data sets
and where we can go,
and the more we turn up
our digital ads ??
Herjavec: Before we argue
about your valuation...
Yeah.
...I invested in a company
last year called Butter Cloth...
Mm?hmm.
Okay.
...and we've done
about $3.5 million
worth of sales.
Yeah.
This is fascinating to me.
Tell me how you spent $32,000
to create
a proprietary material.
So, the proprietary element
of the shirt is BaoTech.
But what is that?
Is that a chemical
or is that material?
Shrinking, fading, stains,
and odors ??
It's the process
behind that ??
Anybody can get that.
Anybody can do that, right?
Can anybody do that?
Anybody can do it.
We own the name
behind BaoTech.
You can buy ??
There's a lot of
different technologies
that you can try
to piece together,
different things that ??
So, I want to be
really clear on that.
What you're asking me
to invest in
is you two guys
and the brand.
Yes.
Not in a proprietary
material.
No, no.
Correct.
So, guys, if I go online
and just search polos,
there are thousands
of options.
Zillions.
Sure. Sure.
Okay?
Huge marketplace.
If I go into retail,
there are hundreds of choices
I can make
at different price points
with different brands.
Absolutely.
Some brands,
very well?known globally.
Then there's...
Bobab, right?
Baobab.
Baobab.
?Baobab.
?Baobab.
That's another problem.
Baobab.
What?
Baobab...
O'Leary: Baobab.
...it's the tree of life
in Africa.
We wanted to pick a name
that represented strength
and longevity ??
How about a name
people can pronounce?
Let's go with that.
Look, guys,
this is a story
about a very special
polo shirt...
It is.
Davenport: Yes.
...in a really
competitive market.
Really competitive.
So, in the last two months,
we've done $35,000 ??
Cuban: So tell us
how you sold ??
That's nothing!
No, wait, so tell us
how you sold $35,000.
To Kevin's point,
you have to communicate that
and translate that
into sales.
Tell us
how you're doing that.
Our cost per acquisition,
our cost per sale is $38.
We sell primarily online.
How are people finding you?
Uh, so, it's on Facebook ads
and Instagram ads, as well.
And we've also gotten
some recent press
for being one of
the best polo shirts
to buy this summer.
There's nothing special
about the shirt
in regards to it can be done
by any and everybody,
but I think that
you've made slight adjustments
to make something
really great,
'cause the shirt
is a great shirt.
But you have a $1.5 million
valuation there.
What is the reasoning
for that?
So, we have
more inventory coming
and we're looking to sell
a lot more
and close the year out
at $400,000.
So, we did a 3 times
multiple of that.
Of what?
Of ?? Of the ??
Of 3 1/2 times ??
Of future sales.
'Cause we're gonna get there
at the end of the year.
I have learned
to not listen to Daymond
and love
the clothing business.
We're doing really well
with Butter Cloth,
and we're about
to introduce a polo,
so it would be
competitive for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
Is this full?time
for you guys now?
It is full?time.
Yes.
And you guys are still
based in New York?
?Yes.
?We're based in New York City.
How are you living?
Occasionally,
we've, like, paid ourselves,
but nothing serious.
If there's a consulting
opportunity,
we may take that.
What kind of consulting?
So, digital customer
acquisition, generally.
So that's the important part,
right?
I mean,
it's a great product,
but how you sell digitally
makes or breaks this company.
Absolutely.
And what you haven't done
is convinced us
that that's
your secret sauce,
that you guys are experts
in that category.
I'm a tech guy.
Yeah.
Sell me on what you can do
technologically.
So, we're building
community online.
Every customer,
we're reaching out to them,
getting feedback.
Our repeat customer rate
is around 25%.
But how?
Is it just Facebook ads
and then you just stay connected
with them via e?mail, or...?
Yeah, so, let's not
overcomplicate this.
That's the beauty
about digital, right?
It levels the playing field
for every company.
Right.
And, so,
we're taking the tools
and our knowledge
and experience
and applying it
to our business.
Look, you've done a great job
at explaining the opportunity,
but you have
a pretty hard road ahead
explaining the difference
between this
and all the other
competitors.
I'm not gonna take the journey.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
You still have other Sharks.
Thank you, though.
John: So, guys, you've come up
with a great product,
but the sales right now,
that's the only hard data
that I can go off of.
Right.
And I'm over here
wrestling with the valuation,
and then I have to just believe
you're a good digital marketer.
Again, I love the shirt,
but I just don't think
it's there for me.
I'm out.
Um, I think you guys
are doing everything right.
Like, you hit every single thing
spot?on.
You added the repellent
for the stains,
you added the wiping cloth,
which I just love.
Microfiber.
I will definitely
be a customer.
Unfortunately here,
I just don't think that
this is right for me.
For those reasons, I'm out.
Cuban: Guys.
So we ?? So we ??
We're deciding whether ??
Wait. There's one Shark left.
Address Mark Cuban.
Okay, go ahead.
Guys, I tried
to get to the heart
of your digital marketing
skills, right?
Because that's what's gonna
make or break you.
I've been begging
to get it out of you,
and I just haven't
been able to,
and I was looking for it.
I was right there,
closeable,
and you didn't come at me
and close me.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
My name
is Jake Slatnick.
I'm from
San Diego, California.
And my name's
Eric Goodchild,
and I'm from
Phoenix, Arizona.
And we're seeking $500,000
for 7% of our company.
?Whoa.
?Wow.
In today's world, everything
needs to be wirelessly charged.
Your phone, your watch,
your headphones ?? everything.
And so an innovative technology
was released
to make the whole process
easier,
something you've probably
heard of ??
wireless charging.
And the consensus?
Ehh.
If your phone's just
slightly off the center,
the thing
doesn't even work.
Well, that doesn't seem
so innovative.
It's not.
So, we've created the future
of wireless charging.
Eric will hand that out.
Are you shipping product,
or are you just ??
is it still
in prototype mode?
So, we just finished
our production prototype
and we're actually moving
into the production phase.
So, we have one ??
he's gonna pass it down ??
and what
I want to make clear is
there's a cosmetic example
and then the electronics
example.
Herjavec: Which is the...
The cosmetic example
is the one that looks like
a retail product.
Is this what the finished
product would look like?
So ?? Kevin, pay attention
to this one ??
we're actually
a licensing business, right?
So, the electronics module
that you hold in your hand
is what we actually will sell
to our licensees.
So, anybody can then
buy this technology from you,
and they're going to brand it
however they want to?
Exactly.
Alright.
So, the product
in your hand now
is how you might see it
on a retail shelf.
Can it scale larger?
We can make this
in any size.
Like, what about an iPad
and two phones, right?
So, if an iPad was wirelessly
enabled to charge ??
It's coming, though.
Yeah, absolutely.
Herjavec: Jake,
isn't this available today?
Tell me the difference
between this
and my Apple charger.
Perfect.
So, wireless charging
right now
all works
exactly the same.
There's a little coil
in there, actually,
that looks just like this.
There's a little hotspot
in the center of that thing,
and if you're not lined up,
you can't receive power.
And just to give you
a little insight ??
so, Eric is one of the foremost
experts in the world
on Tesla coils.
Wow.
And the same
underlying technology ??
Really?
Yeah, he actually holds
a Guinness Book of World Record
for one of the largest,
most powerful Tesla coils
ever built.
Really?
Yeah.
He's been an expert in this
for over a decade.
The wireless power,
you know,
between this big coil
and the small coil
is the same technology
that's built into phones today.
And, Eric, did you actually
build this?
Yeah, I built this coil
in high school.
It's been rebuilt, like,
five or six times.
Greiner: Oh, my gosh.
You actually built this?
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Yeah, it's hand?built.
Are you familiar
with uBeam
and what Energous is doing,
as well?
I'm not familiar
with uBeam.
Okay,
they're two competitors.
uBeam's a company
I happen to be an investor in
that doesn't take
the same approach.
It's fully wireless
from any point in a room
to be able to distribute
using sound?based technology.
Hmm. Interesting.
I still think that
there's a strong chance
you guys get leap?frogged.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Herjavec: Jake, do you have
a final product?
Do you have
any licensing deals?
Do you have any sales?
So, we already have
our first licensing partner.
They're one of the largest
companies in the space.
They put in
their first order last week
for 33,000 pieces.
33,000 pieces?
And what is that retail
equivalent?
So, it's up to our licensees
what it retails for,
but we can say that we'd get
between $4 and $10 per unit.
But they were so excited
about the technology
that they pre?paid
the royalties
on all 33,000 units.
Wow.
Herjavec: If you've already
been pre?paid for the license
from the first licensee,
why do you need
the money today?
So, we have
a burn rate right now
of $30,000 a month,
and that needs to go up
to $50,000 a month
in order to bulk up
our engineering team
and get to market
on time.
John: Listen,
I see tech moving so quick,
and I just don't see
the long?term vision
because things will
constantly change,
so I'm out.
Okay. Understood.
Herjavec: Eric, I think
it's really clever.
This could be
one of those things
that could be world?changing,
revolutionary technology.
All right, I'll give you
the $500,000 for 10%.
Goodchild: It was two
really hard choices,
and at the end
of the day,
we turned it into
one really great one.
One great choice.
Absolutely.
