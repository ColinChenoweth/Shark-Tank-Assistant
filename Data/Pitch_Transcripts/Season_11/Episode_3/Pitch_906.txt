Hi, Sharks,
my name is Brandon.
And my name
is Marcellus.
And we're asking for
$150,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company, Baobab.
We are two hardworking
professionals
living in New York City
who just love to wear
polo shirts.
It's almost like
our uniform.
But we got tired and frustrated
with how they failed us
after only a few wears
and washes.
And you guys know exactly
what he's talking about.
When your shirt fades...
And goes from
classy to ashy.
Or when it shrinks up
in the wash.
And your large
turns into a shmedium.
Oh, my God,
I hate shmediums!
[ Light laughter ]
Or when your collar
bacons and curls,
that's something
that we call bacon collar.
So we set out
on a mission
to solve all these problems
and more
through using design,
technology, and innovation.
And that's why we created
the Baobab polo shirt...
The perfect polo shirt!
...the perfect polo shirt!
The Baobab polo shirt
is made from the best cotton
in the world ??
Peruvian Pima cotton.
Now, through our proprietary
fabrication process
called BaoTech,
it makes this shirt
completely resistant to stains,
like coffee?
Coming right up.
?Wow.
?Whoa
?Wow.
?Like wine.
Did you order Pinot Noir?
I did, I did.
?Wow.
?Dang.
Cuban: Not the ketchup!
No!
Davenport:
I used to always hate
when something like this
would happen.
[ Laughter ]
Like I said,
not the ketchup!
?No!
?Not the ketchup.
Here you go, bro.
Absolutely.
?Wow.
?Wow!
Sharks,
when I do decide to wash it,
it's not gonna shrink
or fade.
And with our patent?pending
stay?flat collar,
we keep collars looking great
for a really long time.
Sharks,
let's take a bite
out of this $30 billion
menswear industry
and join us in making
undeniably better polo shirts.
All right. Very cool.
Great presentation!
And meanwhile, I want to
make sure that I see you guys,
so I'm gonna go ahead
and clean off my glasses
with this hidden
microfiber cloth
that's on the inside.
Greiner: Oh, you're kidding.
[ Laughs ]
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
But wait, there's more!
Alexander: Just to make sure
we can see each other.
Greiner: That's so smart.
Yeah,
that is a cool idea.
Herjavec: Oh,
the material's great.
Davenport: Nice black polo.
It's the all black.
Thank you.
We have the black polo
for you there.
Greiner:
Oh, and it's a zipper.
O'Leary: So, guys,
is this 100% pure cotton?
So, it's 98%
Peruvian Pima cotton,
and then there's
2% stretch.
And what do you
charge for it?
We charge $98.
What stops the ketchup
from staining the white shirt?
Yeah, so,
that's the BaoTech.
So, it's a treatment
when we produce
the fabric of the shirt
that's added
that protects the shirts.
My biggest pet peeve
with polo shirts is the collars.
?Yes!
?The bacon collar.
?Right.
?That is such a great idea.
And I'm glad
you brought that up.
We actually have
a provisional patent
on our stay?flat collar.
Can you tell us
what's your background,
what did you used to do
before this?
And same with you.
Yeah, so,
I worked at a media company.
I did partnerships,
media partnerships ??
Which one?
So, Hearst Media is one of them,
and also Travelzoo.
And, Brandon,
what do you do?
