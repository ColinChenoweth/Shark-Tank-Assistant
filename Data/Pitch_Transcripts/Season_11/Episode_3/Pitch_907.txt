Hi, Sharks.
I'm Jessica, Alpha Squid.
And I'm Gabe,
Beta Squid.
And these are our Squid Kids,
Casen and Claire.
We're asking for $125,000
for 20% of our company.
Casen, you're super strong,
right?
Let's pull
baby Claire's sock off.
Pull her Squid Sock off.
Pull from the toe.
Pull as hard as you can!
You're so strong!
You're so strong!
Good job, Casen!
Awesome job, buddy.
High five!
Good job, buddy.

Whether it's
at the grocery store,
in the car seat, at home,
day care, or anywhere,
the sock battle is a real
problem and pain point.
Babies and toddlers
love to pull their socks off,
and for busy parents,
that extra hassle
is just too much.
Squid Socks helps parents
and caregivers
take back some sanity
and make the daily sock battle
a thing of the past.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to share their ocean
with our little Squids?
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
We have a pull?test here.
Could we get a Shark
to come...
I'll do it.
Gabe:
...help us with that?
So, Lori, on this side,
we have a traditional
baby sock,
and on this side,
we have a Squid Sock.
If you want to just pull on
both of those socks.
Both at the same time?
Yes.
Oh, wow.
Oh, don't break her leg,
Lori.
[ Laughter ]
Don't hurt the baby!
Jessica: You break her,
you buy her.
Oh, my God.
This is a real baby,
you know.
Honestly, like,
it really stayed.
All right, we're gonna hand out
some samples for you guys
really quick.
Come on, you're gonna
help me, buddy.
Okay,
so this is Robert, okay?
Herjavec: Hi.
You're gonna give Robert
this pack, okay?
Thank you very much.
Say, "There you go, Robert."
Okay, then Robert's gonna
hand these to Lori, okay?
Greiner: Thank you.
Okay.
And then we're gonna
give this to Kevin.
Do you want to stand up there
and give it to Kevin?
Okay,
what do you say to Kevin?
Don't bite me, Kevin.
That's right,
"Don't bite me, Kevin."
[ Laughs ]
Herjavec: Aww.
Good job, buddy.
So, you guys all have
a kitted pack,
and then a loose one
so you can feel that.
Okay, buddy.
Great job, sweetie.
Let's go!
Bye?bye.
Good job, guys!
Is Jessica coming back?
Absolutely.
[ Laughs ] Ah.
Um, I only like socks
that have
this kind of bottom.
The anti?slip.
Because, right,
you're gonna slip and fall.
Right.
Right.
So it's really smart
you put it on ??
Oh!
...you incorporated the bottom
using that,
but now your ingenuity
is in the inside here...
Correct, that's
the bread and butter.
...where you're putting
your dots.
Yeah. That's right.
So, tell me
how you came up with it.
So, we were on our honeymoon
about 4 1/2 years ago.
We were visiting
his cousin.
And we were sitting down,
eating dinner,
and his little son's socks
kept falling off,
and dad
was so frustrated.
He goes, "Ugh, if somebody
could just invent a sock
that would stay on ??
a baby sock
that would stay on ??
it'd be
a million?dollar idea."
We're like,
"Ding ding ding ding!"
[ Laughs ]
Literally that night,
we went back
to our hotel room and...
[Imitates keyboard clacking]
"Does anybody have this?
Really? No?"
That's a honeymoon.
?That's a honeymoon!
?Yeah, right?
True entrepreneurs.
"Honey!"
[ Laughter ]
And did you then
seek to patent it?
So, we have
one utility patent pending
on the squiddy dots
inside the cuff,
and then
we have trademarks.
Herjavec: I have
13?month?old twins.
Right.
I don't even
put socks on them anymore
'cause they're
gonna be gone.
They're on the side
of the street,
they're in cars,
they're everywhere.
We've had customers that
that pain point is so real,
these are the only socks
that they'll
have their kids wear.
It's brilliant.
The challenge, guys ??
I mean, it says,
"Squiddy dots
hold socks on,"
but how are you gonna
communicate to people,
you know,
that they need this?
Gabe: Right.
One thing we're doing
is introducing a new program
for our retailers
where we have
a video of baby socks,
pulling their socks off ??
That's expensive.
I've been through this
with many other products.
The compliance
at the store level
to actually implement,
install, maintain?
Zero.
Yeah, 'cause no one cares.
Herjavec: Where are you
in the growth of the company?
Are you pre?launch?
Do you have sales?
Yeah, so, we have been
in business for 16 months.
We have
$40,000 in sales.
$40,000?
And what do you say,
Jessica?
Have you tried that?
We're open.
I mean, we're not gonna take
that off the table, for sure.
We're still in it.
You know, reinventing
and starting a new sock company
makes practically no sense
because it's
a really old industry,
and the lines of distribution
are already established.
John: Kevin can talk about
you can't reinvent the sock,
but my guys at Bombas
didn't reinvent the sock,
but they're doing
a massive amount of business.
And they're doing
extremely well.
I mean, guys,
I think the path
for success here is obvious,
but, you know,
there's other Sharks
that have companies
in the sock business,
and I don't want
to start from scratch
in the sock business,
and I don't want
to do all the work
to set up the logistics.
What a hassle
that's gonna be.
But, look,
you shouldn't take this
behind the barn and shoot it
'cause it's a great idea.
Thank you.
And you've got
to figure out a way
to get logistics,
but I'm out.
Okay. I respect that.
Thank you.
Thank you
for all your feedback.
Look, I can't disagree
with anything you've said.
It's a great company...
Thank you.
...you've set
a great foundation,
and, you know, one of
the great indicators of success
is your ability
to fight back from problems.
Right.
All those things
that drive you crazy.
The reality is, though,
this is not my wheelhouse.
It's just, you know...
[ Laughs ]
I may be a puppet guy,
but I'm not a sock guy.
So I'm out.
[ Laughs ] Okay.
Thanks, Mark.
Thanks, Mark.
You're welcome.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner:
I like everything about it.
I think that
if you buy these,
why would you ever buy
any other sock?
Right.
But, um, I'm not sure
it's the right investment
for me,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you, Lori.
You know,
you're very small,
but you're very committed.
Extremely.
And you're
the nicest two people
I think we've had in the Tank
in a long time.
Aww.
I'm not
in the sock business today,
but I've done very well
in the clothing business.
And what we've learned
out of that is
it's great
to have a great product,
but it's also important
to have a very unique position.
But this stuff
is a lot of work.
It's a lot of work.
Our team can really help you
with the digital marketing...
Yes.
...some of the back end.
Yeah.
We can help you
get out there.
But, uh...
[ Laughs ]
....$125,000
and you're asking for 20%.
Again, I know
the amount of work.
I'll give you the $125,000
for...
40%.
Oh! Hello.
Jessica and Gabe have an offer
on the table from Robert
for their stay?on
baby?sock company,
Squid Socks.
I'll give you the $125,000
for...40%.
Oh! Hello.
It's really a flyer
on a great product
and two great people.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate the offer.
Now, Daymond "Sock Man."
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Yeah, I have interest.
I like this.
Yeah, I think that
something like, you know,
you should have somebody doing
the manufacturing and licensing,
and then you have the ability
to sell direct to your customer.
You keep that category.
And I think there's another
licensing play here, as well ??
licensing the technology
to some of
the bigger guys or girls,
for two reasons.
Number one, you take them
out of the market
as potential competitors
trying to make something else,
some other version of yours...
Okay.
...as well as, in this area,
a lot of them already
have the characters
like Peppa Pig and Marvel
and stuff like that.
So, they're selling massive ??
I mean, they're doing
$200 million.
Right.
Mm?hmm.
I think I can help you.
I'm gonna match
Robert's offer.
[ Sighs ]
O'Leary: Whoa.
John: Are you ??
Yeah, you know what?
I wouldn't want to be
more of an owner
than the owners,
so I will take it down
to 33%.
33%.
Ooh.
$125,000 for 33%.
That's pretty good.
I love it.
33%?
Greiner:
And you know what?
I like Daymond's offer
so much
that if Daymond
would want to have me,
I would come in with him
just 'cause I think
what he wants to do
is so smart.
I would do it.
I love and respect Lori a lot,
but hell no.
[ Laughter ]
Wah, wah, wah.
Just 'cause this is my area,
you know what I mean?
[ Both whispering indistinctly ]
You have two offers
on the table.
Gabe: Right.
Daymond's 33%...
33%.
...and he's giving you
the $125,000.
I didn't even play hardball.
I went from 40% to 33%.
I'm not gonna negotiate
against myself.
Robert's gone up
to $250,000 for 40%.
Make a decision.
Or $125,000 for 30%.
Or $125,000 for 30%.
Right.
So, which offer
are you making?
I'm making both.
Multiple choice.
If he feels
he needs more cash ??
Would you be willing
to match Robert's offer
at $125,000 for 30%?
I know the value I bring.
No.
Okay.
Okay.
[ Whispering ] Do you want to
ask Daymond if he can...
Congrats, guys.
That's awesome.
Jessica: Thank you, guys.
I can't take it
off my hand!
Good luck, Kevin!
Good job.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God.
Jessica:
We chose Daymond because
he is really the ideal fit.
I mean, he understands
that sock industry
inside and out.
He's been wildly successful
with the sock company Bombas.
It seemed like a no?brainer
and just a natural fit
and the perfect partner
for us.
