My name is Samy Kobrosly,
So, here you go.
Lovely. Thank you, Samy.
Yep. Absolutely.
Greiner: Yum.
Oza: Any particular order
or just go for it?
You can go for it.
They're all gonna be delicious.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Can't wait to get all the crumbs
on my suit.
?Thank you very much.
?Absolutely.
Thanks, Samy.
Can I see the bags, too, Samy?
Yep. Absolutely.
Thank you, sir.
So, I'm here today
seeking $250,000
for 2.5% of my company,
Snacklins.
?Hello!
?What?!
?Hoo?whoo!
?You cheapskate.
?iAy, papi!
[ Laughs ]
?This should be fun.
?Wow.
So, you're gonna have
Chesapeake Bay flavored
barbecue, miso ginger.
Like I said, they're gonna be
crunchy, they're gonna be salty,
you're gonna get that nice
umami bomb from the mushrooms.
I like the lightness.
It makes me feel like
I'm eating something healthy.
I must say ?? the first bite
tasted like paper.
Now I've had my fourth.
I'm starting to dig it.
Samy, who's "we"?
I say "we" 'cause we're
a big family at Snacklins.
So, everyone
from our first employees
who are still with us today,
I hope you have some sales,
Samy.
I think
you'll appreciate this.
Last year,
we sold $200,000 in product,
?Why would you do that, Samy?
?I offered.
'Cause we're building
American jobs,
?Samy, look here.
?Yeah?
I really do like
your ingredients,
in Samy's vegan pork rinds
company, Snacklins,
but he wants a better deal
than the $250,000 for 2.5%
Samy is offering.
If you want to make me an offer
I can't refuse, I'll listen,
but otherwise, I'm out.
Samy, surely you have room
in your pocket
to make him
a better offer.
Oza: Samy, I'm telling you,
you need him. I've done this.
So, Samy,
he turned you down at 5%.
Are you willing
to modify that even more?
Yes or no?
Yeah.
We could figure it out.
I'm listening.
Like I said, I'm here.
I'm scrappy.
I'm here to make something work.
I'm here to work hard.
But the problem is, Samy,
you only have 30%,
?Great job, Samy.
?Good guy.
Kobrosly: I cannot believe
that I just made a deal
with <i>the</i> Mark Cuban.
