My name is Samy Kobrosly,
hailing from
Rockville, Maryland.
So, here you go.
Lovely. Thank you, Samy.
Yep. Absolutely.
Greiner: Yum.
Oza: Any particular order
or just go for it?
You can go for it.
They're all gonna be delicious.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Can't wait to get all the crumbs
on my suit.
?Thank you very much.
?Absolutely.
And last, but not least.
Thanks, Samy.
Can I see the bags, too, Samy?
Yep. Absolutely.
Thank you, sir.
So, I'm here today
seeking $250,000
for 2.5% of my company,
Snacklins.
?Hello!
?What?!
?Hoo?whoo!
?You cheapskate.
?iAy, papi!
[ Laughs ]
?This should be fun.
?Wow.
So, you're gonna have
Chesapeake Bay flavored
barbecue, miso ginger.
Like I said, they're gonna be
crunchy, they're gonna be salty,
you're gonna get that nice
umami bomb from the mushrooms.
I like the lightness.
It makes me feel like
I'm eating something healthy.
I must say ?? the first bite
tasted like paper.
Now I've had my fourth.
I'm starting to dig it.
That's some good paper,
though, right?
And you know what I'm
really liking about it?
I'm only eating 80 calories
for the whole bag.
I know.
That's what I like.
This was my chance to really
make my impact, you know?
I love junk food.
Everyone likes junk food.
But the problem is, it's junk.
No one else has figured out
how to use fresh ingredients ??
not some weird,
powdered form of it ??
fresh ingredients to make
a shelf?stable chip
that tastes like junk food.
And that "Aha" moment came
because we knew that
we had something special.
Samy, who's "we"?
I say "we" 'cause we're
a big family at Snacklins.
So, everyone
from our first employees
who are still with us today,
angel investors,
friends and family ??
you know, everyone has
a piece of the company, so...
So, how much of the company
do <i>you</i> have?
I personally own 30%.
How much
do the employees own?
The employees
have a 10% pool.
Good for you.
That's awesome.
Thank you.
This is probably the sportiest
valuation I've seen in a while.
$10 million.
$10 million valuation,
correct?
I hope you have some sales,
Samy.
I think
you'll appreciate this.
Last year,
we sold $200,000 in product,
and this year, we'll finish
the year at around $2 million.
What?!
We've grown tenfold
in the past year,
selling to about
850 stores nationwide.
Wow.
We started off
with 36 stores
about a year and a half ago.
From mom?and?pops
to national chains,
such as Whole Foods,
Walmart, 7?Eleven.
We went out there,
we hit the pavement ourselves.
I mean, I can tell you, when I
had that meeting with 7?Eleven,
my baby was born
the night beforehand.
And so, four hours later,
I jumped on a plane
and I went to Dallas, and I met
with the heads of 7?Eleven.
Respect the hustle.
I'll do anything
I have to,
because Snacklins
is that important to us.
?I respect the hustle.
?Break down the numbers for me.
We're running, currently,
at about 30% gross margin.
We've invested
a lot in ourselves
with, you know,
building our own factory.
We're not using
some co?packer.
Oh, you built
your own factory?
?We built our own.
?Kevin's gonna love this one.
I want to see the same employees
that I had with me ??
?Why would you do that, Samy?
?I offered.
'Cause we're building
American jobs,
and I think that creating
American jobs ??
No, but there's
co?packers in America
that already spent
the money.
But they're <i>not,</i> and that's why
I think Snacklins is so unique.
There's not a single co?packer
that is doing what we're doing.
I'm entirely for
building your own factory
because I've never seen
a food product succeed
where they didn't take control
of the kitchen.
Mm?hmm.
It's an essential thing
you have to do,
but that you did it so quickly
shocks me.
How much money
did you raise?
We raised $1.5 million
to date.
?Wow.
?Wow. That was quick.
?That's a lot of trust.
?It's a lot of trust.
We've had some
pretty great partners throughout
that have helped us
get through there.
Why do you need us?
Because we're about
11 months, 12 months away
from becoming profitable.
I have enough money
to last me about 10 months,
and not only do I think
a strategic Shark
who, A, could help me out
with retailers,
could help me out
with really exploring
the avenues that it is out
there, but that would give us
that last two months
of funding we need
before we become profitable.
So, what do you sell
each bag for?
So, each bag goes for about
$1.99 to $2.29 on the shelf
depending where it's at.
And what's your cost?
Our cost right now
is about 90 cents.
Wow.
So, your margins
aren't awesome,
and that's
part of the problem.
I invested in a phenomenal
business called Pipcorn.
Mm?hmm.
And if I were
to say to you that today,
they have 3,500 stores
and $12 million in sales,
you would say
"Wow. What a success."
But now I'm gonna give you
the other side of it.
They have
negligible profit.
I haven't made a dime
on that business,
and they've just
finished selling off
about 1/3 of the business
to try to raise
yet more money again
for the slotting fees
to buy the shelf space.
This food space is tough.
But most importantly, it takes
enormous amounts of money.
That's the problem.
You're gonna chip
your way down.
You constantly have to feed
the dragon with more cash.
So, because I've been there
and done that...
Mm?hmm.
...I'm out.
Alright,
thank you, Barbara.
I love things
in the space
of being 80 calories for
a healthy, lighter snack.
But I feel
it's a little too risky
and too early for me
right now.
Your valuation
doesn't make sense.
?Oh, I appreciate that.
?So, I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you so much.
?Samy, look here.
?Yeah?
I really do like
your ingredients,
and I like the trend
that you're going down.
But where I struggle is,
your valuation's out to lunch,
you own your own manufacturing,
which I hate.
Manufacturing your own stuff
in this industry
is just tough as heck.
And I would 100% agree.
And it is economically
just not viable, long?term.
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Well, thank you.
I think the reason that we are
doing our own manufacturing
is because no one else
has figured out how to do this.
Yeah, look.
They're wrong.
I talk about Alyssa's Cookies
all the time.
You're familiar with them,
right?
Absolutely. Yeah.
So, started ?? the guy was
living out of his car,
had no money, came to me,
and now six years later,
we'll do $20 million in sales.
The better part is, we'll do
$8 or $9 million in profits
Yeah.
And so
we're killing it.
Now, one of the things that
I fought Doug on originally
was his own factory.
Mm?hmm.
I was wrong,
he was right,
because he was
the only one
who could do the process
that he invented.
So, having
something unique ??
It's yours. Do it.
Now, in terms of this ??
$10 million valuation.
Won't even argue that.
But...one fatal flaw.
in Samy's vegan pork rinds
company, Snacklins,
but he wants a better deal
than the $250,000 for 2.5%
Samy is offering.
If you want to make me an offer
I can't refuse, I'll listen,
but otherwise, I'm out.
Samy, surely you have room
in your pocket
to make him
a better offer.
Oza: Samy, I'm telling you,
you need him. I've done this.
The only brand, to be fair,
in this space that I've seen
that's making
genuinely high profits
on a relatively small scale
is Alyssa's.
I give him that.
The bulk of the brands
in this industry, though,
you're gonna need
a ton more cash,
so if he can do to yours
what he did to Alyssa's...
So, Samy,
he turned you down at 5%.
Are you willing
to modify that even more?
Yes or no?
Yeah.
We could figure it out.
I'm listening.
Like I said, I'm here.
I'm scrappy.
I'm here to make something work.
I'm here to work hard.
But the problem is, Samy,
you only have 30%,
and I don't want to throw you
under the bus, right?
You have other shareholders
that you have to consider.
I mean,
I want to be fair.
And I think,
with all due respect,
I used to own
100% of nothing,
and I'm living
the American dream.
I mean, I'm a Muslim
first?generation American
who is now pitching
a vegan pork rind
on "Shark Tank."
[ Laughter ]
Like, if that's not
the American dream,
I don't know what is,
you know?
I like it.
And so, yeah,
I'll work with you, you know?
Come back with something.
If it's cool,
I'd like, you know ??
But you're here now,
so I'll do the $250,000
for 5% straight equity,
5% advisory shares that can vest
over three years.
So it's a little bit easier
on your investors
and your employees.
?Great job, Samy.
?Good guy.
Kobrosly: I cannot believe
that I just made a deal
with <i>the</i> Mark Cuban.
He can help us get there
and really show
that Snacklins isn't
some bougie, highfalutin snack
that no one can afford.
It's an approachable snack
that <i>anyone</i> can afford.
