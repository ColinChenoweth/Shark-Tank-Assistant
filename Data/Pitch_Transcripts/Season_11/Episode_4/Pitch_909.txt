Tyler, Tyler, listen.
There's a lot of competition
in this area,
so I just don't feel
it's investable for me,
so I'm out.
Jay: You're out?
Well,
can I just tell you ??
?Bye, Tyler.
?Thank you.
Tyler,
do the right thing.
You're riding
back out on that?
You guys, have a good one.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
Congrats, Tyler.
Good luck.
Jay: I think the Sharks
made a big mistake
by not investing in Plop Star.
I think you're gonna see us
everywhere,
