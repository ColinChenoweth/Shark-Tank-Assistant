My name is Kelley.
And I'm Ellen McAlister.
And we're from beautiful
South Florida.
And our product sucks.
We mean it.
[ Laughs ]
It, like ??
literally, it sucks.
The best way
we can explain this to you
is to introduce you
to one of our customers.
This is
Mosquito Magnet Mom.
Greiner: Oh!
It doesn't matter
where she goes ??
the mosquitos
will bite her.
[ Laughs ]
At least she has some items
around the house
to help her with the itching
and swelling, right?
Wrong.
At this point,
she's desperate
and starts scouring
the Internet
for mommy blogs
and home remedies
that tell her
to do things
like rub dryer sheets
over her bites
or even apply
a hot spoon.
Aah!
[ Laughter ]
But none of these remedies
are working, either.
[ Groans ]
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
None of them
are addressing
what is causing her body
to itch and swell.
Huh?
In this case,
it's the mosquito saliva.
For other insects,
it can be their venom.
But what if I told you
that I have a tool
that can remove
the insect saliva venom
from a bite or sting
so your body stops
producing the reaction
that is causing you
to itch and swell?
I'd tell you, "Get on with it!
I'm dying over here!"
Here. Use this.
Bug Bite Thing.
Oh.
?Bug Bite Thing.
?That's neat.
What's it called?
Bug Bite Thing.
Yeah.
What's the name of it?
Bug Bite Thing.
Bug Bite Thing.
?Bug Bite Thing.
?It's very clear.
Higney:
Bug Bite Thing.
How do you use it?
It's easy.
You simply place it
over a bite or sting,
apply a little pressure,
slowly pull up
on the handles,
and hold
for 10 to 30 seconds
while the irritant is drawn
into the removable cap.
Then,
release the suction,
wash out the end cap,
and you're ready
for your next bite.
Aren't you gonna tell them
what we want?
I was getting to that.
Sharks,
we are seeking $150,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
So, who wants to help us take
the bite out of a sting with...
Bug Bite Thing?
Bug Bite Thing?
Ellen, you have won
the "Shark Tank" Academy Award.
Yeah. You definitely get Best
Supporting Actress, for sure.
So, take a package
and a loose one, please.
And a loose one?
Okay, got it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I like the name
'cause it's pretty clear.
"Oh, go get that
Bug Bite Thing."
Does this work on ticks?
Higney: So, the product
works on insects
that leave
their saliva or venom
just under the surface
of the skin,
so that's mosquitos, bees,
wasps, red ants ?? venom.
Can we show some
before?and?after pictures...
Oza: Sure.
...so you can
kind of see?
Yes.
Maybe that will
help you guys
visualize
a little bit better.
Oza: Oh, here we go.
Greiner: [ Gasps ] Wow.
Okay, so,
this is one ??
This little boy's name's
Colin.
This is an image that
we received from his mom.
As soon as the children
start swelling,
you use the tool,
and it instantly gives you
the relief
because you're expelling
the venom.
How long is
the time period there?
That's after, probably,
within the hour, she told me.
Really?
That's pretty cool.
I love your guys' energy.
Can you give me ??
What's the relationship here?
What's the background?
This is Mom.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, that was my assumption,
but I ?? you know?
Yes, this is my mom.
How did you
come up with this?
My husband and I moved from
California to South Florida
about six years ago,
and I was never even close
to being prepared
for the mosquitos
in Florida.
So, when I was working
in our family?owned company,
we deal with a lot of
overseas customers,
and I had, of course,
had a fresh bite,
and I was complaining,
and I said,
"Gosh, these mosquitos
are killing me out here."
And one of our customers,
she said,
"Have you heard of a tool
that takes out the irritant
so you stop itching
and swelling?"
And I said, "No."
So, we tracked down
the manufacturer of the product.
We actually
teamed up with him.
It seems very replicable,
though.
I mean, there can't be
a patent on this thing
in any capacity.
I mean...
There's not a patent,
but our manufacturer
is in Denmark.
It has clinical trials.
We were able to secure
an exclusive deal with him
for the entire
United States.
Good for you.
Do you have to pay
a royalty on it?
McAlister: No.
We just purchase it
directly from him.
Just buy?out, that's it.
Yep.
What do you sell these
for, and what does it
cost you to make them?
So, we sell them online
for $9.95.
Okay.
And we're the number?one
best?seller
in insect bite relief
on Amazon.
How much
did you sell last year
and what are you
selling this year?
Last year,
we sold $500,000.
?You've got to be kidding.
?Good for you.
This year,
in the first five months,
we've sold $800,000.
Yeah, baby!
And we're projected to do
over $2 million
by the end
of September.
Wow.
And your margins
are pretty good on this, no?
We have
an 80% margin online.
So, what does it cost you
to make one of these?
We import them in.
It costs us $1.53 landed.
?Okay.
?It's not expensive.
Packing is running
about 40 cents,
so $2.
$2. Okay.
Are you in, like, CVSs,
Walgreens, all of that?
So, this year, we were able
to secure a deal
with a large
pharmacy chain store,
and we're in over 7,000
of their stores this year.
So, let me ask you
a question.
I like your guys' energy.
I like your guys' vibe.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
I would do the $150,000 for 10%.
Take it.
I mean, I can put this through
the entire retail chain.
I mean, my products are
in every store in America.
Marketing and branding
is kind of my thing.
This would blow out
at Walmart.
We'll get that in
no problem.
You know, this is
the first time in a long time
a valuation comes into
"Shark Tank" that's reasonable.
Well, we understand the value
that you can bring us.
I made an offer, Kevin,
so, you can ??
I'd like to offer you
$200,000 for 10%.
