I'm Tyler Jay,
and I'm seeking $150,000
for a 10% stake in my company,
Plop Star.
Sharks,
I know we just met,
but I want to talk to you
about how you poop.
[ Chuckles ]
Like a lot of people,
if I wasn't in the privacy
of my own home,
I wasn't comfortable
going number two
because of the smell
I might leave behind.
Traditionally bathroom aerosols
just mask the stench,
leaving a sticky film behind
and a bathroom that smells...
[ Sniffs ]
...like a stinky rose garden.
And all these new
drops and sprays
used <i>before</i> going number two
are cumbersome,
leak in a purse,
in a pant pocket.
So, I invented ??
wait for it...
[ Exhales sharply ]
Plop Star,
the world's most discreet
and portable
toilet odor eliminator.
Each Plop Star tablet
is individually wrapped
for ideal portability.
So, how does
Plop Star work?
Just gently drop one tablet
in the bowl
before your performance,
wait a few seconds
before taking a seat.
Plop Star starts
dissolving instantly,
releasing a buffer
of essential oils
on the surface of the water
that block bathroom odors
before they begin.
So, Sharks, which one of you
wants to partner with us
and start a movement?
So, I mean,
the number of puns in there.
O'Leary: Quick question
on the advanced technology here.
When the excrement
goes below the surface...
Ah, geez.
...the odorous gases
are trapped underneath
the oil?film surface?
Is that the idea?
That is correct.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Can I pass out
some samples real quick?
?We'd like to see them.
?Yes, samples, please.
Greiner:
Oh, you're bringing us water.
We can all plop.
[ Laughter ]
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are there different flavors
or just one plopper?
There's just one plopper
so far.
We just go ahead?
Plop it in?
Yeah, plop it in.
Give it a drop.
Thank you.
?Thank you, sir.
?Plop, plop.
?You're welcome.
?Like we're in the laboratory.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Let's see what that's ??
Oh, it smells good.
Oza: Yeah, it smells like
a vitamin C tablet.
?It smells refreshing.
?Yeah.
Cuban: There are several things
that I know.
One ?? I'm a man who likes
to leave his mark.
[ Laughter ]
Unbelievable.
Oh, no!
Two ??
I'm out with prejudice.
That's the greatest out
I've ever seen.
[ Both laugh ]
This has six packets in it.
What does it sell for?
Alright, so, we have
two units right now.
The six?pack is called
the Weekender.
We sell that for $4.99.
[ Chuckles ]
And then our 30?pack
is $12.99.
?What's the revenue?
?Well, what are your sales?
Like, right now,
we have $12,000 in sales.
Cuban: Oh!
Your consumer doesn't seem
to be loving this thus far
or doesn't see the need.
No, I think what it is ??
and why I'm here ??
is because I really wanted
to build the back,
the manufacturing,
make sure that we
had all our nuts and bolts
before we kind of
started promoting.
Before you prove demand?
That's the reverse order of
what should happen here.
Because you're asking me
for a $1.5 million valuation ??
$150,000, 10% ??
and all you got
is $12,000 in sales.
I don't know if anybody
really <i>wants</i> Plop Star.
I'll tell you guys a little bit
about my background.
?Please do.
?Yeah.
I've worked at
large advertising firms,
and five years ago,
I actually started
my own production company.
I've been
incredibly successful.
I do broadcast spots
for large corporations ??
advertising, PR ??
and also direct
to tech firms.
And I wanted to create
a product ??
something that I could
create the content for
that looks super professional
at a cheap rate.
And I kind of had my "Aha"
moment a couple years ago.
My little daughter,
she loves making bath bombs,
and I was like, "Wow.
This would be the perfect
form factor."
Okay.
That makes sense.
So that was
my big "Aha" moment.
There is an 800?pound gorilla
in this market.
I guess I'll say ??
It's Poo?Pourri.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah. And it's
a $300 million brand.
They did $56.5 million.
It's a growing category.
The convenience of not
having to carry a bottle ??
it's innovative.
And listen, Squatty Potty
is my investment.
Correct.
And everybody laughed
at a little stool
that helps you poop.
No, I believe in toilet
in portfolio.
But they have just hit
$160 million in sales,
5 million
Squatty Potties sold.
So, you know,
this could potentially fit
within my family
of entrepreneurs
in the Squatty Potty.
Oza: What you've created here
is interesting.
I think that you've made
the form factor convenient,
and I don't think
that the target audience for you
is B?to?C in consumers.
Because when people go
to other bathrooms,
there's a mind?set
that's absolutely bizarre.
They have no respect.
So you kind of need to target
a business model...
You mean public?
...where that people
who are working in hotels
or public restrooms are like,
"I can drop this
every time."
'Cause it's the guy
before and after me
that destroys the place.
But don't you think
it's a little bit expensive
to sell to businesses?
That's the problem
right there.
Because it is pricy.
I mean,
they like industrial ??
big, huge gallons
of things
and, you know,
the cheap?as?can?be
because they're just
pouring it down a toilet
and they don't care.
Yes.
The B?to?B model,
I don't believe is gonna work.
Not for a second.
But here's what we see
again and again on "Shark Tank,"
which always disturbs me,
is your approach to business,
right?
I see you as a cautious,
respectful, intellectual guy,
very bright,
assessing, analyzing,
figuring out
how you're gonna do it.
You get it right, you're gonna
get all the pieces in place.
But you forgot
to take it out to market
and see if there's
even a demand there.
I don't believe there's
a demand for this product,
so I'm out.
Okay.
You should flush it down
the friggin' toilet.
I'm not kidding.
This is going nowhere.
Greiner: Oh, Kevin.
This is gonna be a zero.
Plop Star sucks.
I'm out.
It's a bad idea.
Tyler, Tyler, listen.
There's a lot of competition
in this area,
so I just don't feel
it's investable for me,
so I'm out.
Jay: You're out?
Well,
can I just tell you ??
I have a 10? and 8?year?old,
and I love them.
I've been working
relentlessly after hours
to make this work.
And, like, my son,
he just goes,
"Dad, this is so cool that
you're building something
that's physically tangible
and bringing it to market."
I actually quite like your idea,
by the way.
O'Leary: Whoa.
What you've created here
is interesting,
but where I struggle is,
you don't have
a game plan.
I feel if I give you
that $150,000...
Can I tell you
what I'd do with it?
...you're gonna flush it.
Because there's no plan
behind it.
I do have a plan,
and it's B?to?B.
It's the omnichannel,
making sure if we could
get into retail ??
You see,
but that's not a plan.
No, no, no,
I was saying that ??
Right there.
I love your energy, but you
said, "I want to go B?to?B."
Great. And then, "Oh,
and omnichannel and retail."
So, with the B??
It's too many "ands."
I'm sorry, but I'm out.
Alright.
Plop Star ??
it's over.
Alright.
Guys, thank you so very much.
?Good luck.
?Take care.
?Bye, Tyler.
?Thank you.
Tyler,
do the right thing.
You're riding
back out on that?
You guys, have a good one.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
Congrats, Tyler.
Good luck.
His coming in and going out
was the best part.
[ Laughs ]
Jay: I think the Sharks
made a big mistake
by not investing in Plop Star.
I think you're gonna see us
everywhere,
and I really do want to prove
all of them wrong
and go, "Man, I should have
gone in on with them."
