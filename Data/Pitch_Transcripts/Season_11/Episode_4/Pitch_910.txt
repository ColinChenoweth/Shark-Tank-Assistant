Hi, Sharks. My name is Marc.
[ Swedish accent ]
Hi. My name is Mikael.
We started
a knife?sharpening service
by mail.
Knife Aid.
A super?simple idea
disrupting an old trade
by e?comm.
For the right Shark,
we're offering the opportunity
to invest $400,000
for 15% of our company.
Ooh,
that's a lot of knives.
A knife is something
most Americans touch every day,
yet knife?sharpening,
a beautiful, ancient craft,
has almost been lost
and has not been digitalized.
Pretty much everyone
has dull knives at home.
People love
using a sharp knife,
but very few people know how,
where we even have the time
to get those knives
sharpened.
And that's the very reason
we started Knife Aid.
So, this is
how simply it works.
Order online,
receive our secure
postage?paid envelope
that guarantees
safe shipping.
Take your dull knives
into the envelope,
back in the mailbox,
and off it goes.
And our expert knifesmiths
will work their magic.
They will re?create
that razor?sharp edge,
and your knives
will come back to you
sharper than the day
you bought them,
all within about a week.
So, Sharks, who wants
a slice of our business?
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary:
I'm very intrigued.
You may not know this,
but I'm actually Chef Wonderful.
Well, I have blades
made by Japanese artists
that once made
samurai swords.
My most expensive
is now $3,500.
Kevin, you have more junk
in your house
than any human being.
I actually sharpen it
with a stone
that has two different
densities on it.
But we'll take
your samples.
So, out with the samples,
and I think, you know,
we want to have
a little bit of fun
before we start talking
about the business
and really showing
the motion of using it.
I'll try it.
Who is most handy
with a hunting knife?
Like, outdoor.
I'll do outdoor.
Fine.
Soderlindh: What we wanted
to illustrate here is,
everybody knows
how it is cutting
when you have
a super?sharp knife
and how easy it goes.
Don't do this at home.
Kevin, if you would start
with a dull knife.
I want you to cut through
the pineapple.
Got it.
Right through the center?
Yeah.
And this is a dull knife.
It's very hard to do
with a dull knife.
And, you see, it's not very fun.
So, you're done.
That's the dull knife.
[ Laughter ]
You're done!
Okay, so, now we try
the sharp knife.
You need to hold
the pineapple steady...
?You want me to swipe at it?
?Yeah, yeah. Do it.
?Oh!
?Look at that!
?Big difference.
?Touché!
Rohan, take the rope
and you fold it in two,
and you take
the dull knife first.
Which is the dull one?
The one that doesn't
say "sharp" on it.
Okay.
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughing ]
Sorry about that.
He got joked!
I deserved that one.
Hold it a little bit closer
to the rope there
so it doesn't slip you.
And hemp is super?hard to cut
in any case.
Now...
Should I go
with the sharp?
Yes, yes.
Oh, I see.
?Wow.
?Wow!
Okay.
I detect the accents.
Soderlindh: Alright,
let's start there.
Marc and I moved to the U. S.
to start up this business.
We have a past of building
global brands and businesses.
Where did you
move here from?
We're from Sweden,
but I'm originally from America.
I grew up in Sweden
and moved to America.
Okay, and what was your best
product that you sold before?
I founded Happy Socks.
?Happy Socks?
?Oh, I love those.
?That was you?
?Yeah, yeah.
Are you still involved
with Happy Socks?
Yes, I am, but I'm not
operational anymore.
I'm on the board
and own them.
And how did you come up
with the knife idea itself?
We saw something
back in our country
that was similar,
but more towards
the commercial side,
and we were thinking about, why
isn't this done for a consumer
and simplify it?
Get an envelope,
get the knives in, fixed price.
It's a quick turnaround.
And how much do you charge?
So, go. Walk us through ??
We would sharpen
an average of $10 a knife
for everything included ??
minimum package,
four knives.
Does it matter the size?
Like, there's serrated,
there's the bread knife,
you know?
Lickfett: Well,
that's what we simplified.
The traditional knife shop
is in a farmers market.
They'll go by inch
and they charge different ??
We made it very simple.
It's per blade.
Doesn't matter the size.
Doesn't matter the size.
Paring knife
to large knife.
Exactly. And even scissors,
so kitchen scissors,
scissors goes in there,
hunting knives...
Oh, you do scissors, too?
Guys,
I'm a little confused.
Something's bugging me.
Okay.
You, Mikael, are clearly
a successful entrepreneur,
so you've obviously made
a fair bit of money.
Why are you here
seeking money
if you've got a sort of pretty
big stackful already?
I have previously failed
on the U. S. market.
We had another brand
going into the American market
without having American people
involved in the business,
having the funds, raising,
and how you actually drive
growth on the American market.
I'm not gonna
do that mistake again.
We put out
two strategies.
Either we go
to venture capital
and get venture?capital?funded
deal on it
or we go all?American
and what we have seen as
the full?on American show,
how you reach out and...
The power of the Tank.
What part of this market
do you need to understand?
It's messaging, almost.
It's really
packaging the product,
how to communicate it,
its channel strategy ??
Connecting with a target
core audience, okay.
Exactly.
What are your sales?
So, we're on 120
on this side of the year.
?$120,000?
?Yeah.
How'd you get those sales?
So, really, what we've done
is mainly experimentation.
We're now on the fourth
iteration of our website.
So, it's sort of
a proof?of?concept sale.
Do you use Instagram ads?
We use Facebook,
Instagram, Google.
How much did you do
last month?
$37,000.
?$37,000?
?Yes.
Greiner: Alright, listen,
I'm gonna give you an offer.
I like the concept.
You're fresh, you're unique,
you're different.
You've already
got the packaging down.
It's really quite good.
I think you are smart
in needing to know
what the market is here.
There's nobody who knows better,
I feel, than ??
I think I do know somebody
who knows better.
No, there isn't anybody
that knows better.
Yeah, there is.
I know 'cause I've sold
over a thousand products...
She believes that,
so listen.
...over 20 years
to predominantly U. S. market.
You gonna make an offer?
But it's a risky offer,
okay?
I mean, I have no idea
how this is gonna go.
I'm just gonna give you
a flyer.
You can take it
or leave it.
I'm gonna give you
$200,000 in cash,
I'm gonna give you $200,000
as a line of credit,
and I want 20%.
I mean, if you want someone
to just give you cash, great.
But if you want someone
to give you their mind,
their heart, their soul,
and the grinding it out,
that's me.
?Well, before we ??
?Yes?
Channel strategy,
that's obviously something ??
Yes, let's talk
a little bit about it.
That's important to you.
You know,
I think the digital strategy ??
obviously, we know what
we're doing and how to acquire.
?So you've got that side down.
?We're down.
But there's still tweaking
to be done.
Of course.
I believe
that there's a lot to do
with physical retail.
What do you mean
"physical retail"?
What do you mean "retail"?
We could put this out
to retailers.
You want them to sell
the service and you just share.
So, in Williams?Sonoma,
they put up a sign,
they say "Have your knives
sharpened by Knife Aid,"
you pay Williams?Sonoma,
you know, 25% of it...
Exactly.
...and you try to get
every retailer,
not just Williams?Sonoma.
And that is brand?building
because they need
to give us their e?mail,
and then
we catch them again.
That's easy money, too.
?So, that's the second channel?
?Yes.
I could just be like,
"Pick a contact, any contact."
I have it into every
single one of these retailers.
We know that.
That's why we're here.
And you asked us
why we're here.
?Yep.
?That's why we are here.
I'm gonna make you
an offer, okay?
I have
all the same contacts,
but I have something
she doesn't have.
I'm Chef Wonderful.
Chef Wonderful's huge in cakes,
chocolates, and meat.
Google him.
He's fantastic.
And I love
to brand stuff...
[ Laughs ]
...around the kitchen.
Soderlindh: Mm?hmm.
I'll get behind this product
'cause I like it a lot.
Here's my offer ??
I'll give you $400,000
for 20%.
I think that's a great idea
because you get Chef Wonderful.
Oza: Guys,
two is always better than one,
so when you get
the queen of retail
and then you put that together
with the king of branding,
I mean,
that's quite the pairing.
We, too, would like
to give you $400,000
for 20% of the company.
You get two Sharks
instead of one self?appointed
Chef Wonderful.
My brands get into
more Americans' hands
than anybody else
on the panel.
Corcoran:
Wait, wait, wait.
I think you're being
very aggressive
in what you're asking.
But I like greedy people,
okay?
[ Laughter ]
So, Kevin and I,
we're gonna offer you
$500,000 for...
20%.
We're upping the ante.
If they want to compete,
go ahead.
It's kind of like
an auction.
But we're
the right team for you.
There's no question
about it.
Greiner: You know,
here's the thing ??
sometimes,
you can take more money,
but that doesn't mean
that you're getting
what you really need.
You need Chef Wonderful.
That's what you need.
I would know if I could
fulfill that for you.
?No question.
?We want to drive fast.
We have the car.
We know how to scale it.
We know what we're doing,
and we need somebody
to say,
"Take that route.
It's faster.
Take that route.
It's faster."
?We've done it!
?That's what I do.
Greiner: What do I always say?
What are my words?
Yeah, we all want
to build something.
Do you guys want to make this
a DTC business?
This is an equity model.
You're gonna have to
raise more cash.
Getting us on board
means that
the biggest venture capitalists
in Silicon Valley
are gonna pay
ungodly evaluations.
Oh, please.
You call up anybody.
They all see you.
And we're gonna take this
to that promised land.
The biggest
venture capitalists?
You call them up,
they're all gonna charge you.
Greiner:
You keep looking over at Mark,
so I have a question.
Soderlindh: Uh?huh.
Are you waiting for Mark
to give you an offer?
Lori and Rohan
have offered Marc and Mikael
$400,000 for 20% of their
knife?sharpening business,
Knife Aid.
Kevin and Barbara
are offering $500,000 ??
also for a 20% stake.
Getting us on board
means that
the biggest venture capitalists
in Silicon Valley
are gonna pay
ungodly evaluations.
Oh, please.
You call up anybody.
They all see you.
Greiner:
You keep looking over at Mark.
Are you waiting for Mark
to give you an offer?
No, I just feel
a lot of energy
coming from
that side of the room.
I'm like, "I don't know
what's going on over there."
Are you gonna
make them an offer?
You asked about
accelerant.
What do you perceive to be
the accelerant that you need?
We just want
more potent outreach.
We need better messaging,
even clearer messaging.
So, there's different ways
to do that, right?
You can buy it,
and that's your SEO, right?
And then there's PR.
?Exactly.
?Right.
That's why I'm asking
the question, because ??
Social PR ??
I mean, all those
free traffic sources ??
those, we really
want to boost.
And that's where I think
I'm stronger than the others
because I can walk into
any media outlet
and pick it up,
deal with whoever I want online.
But I'll let you guys
make a decision here
to see if these deals
are what you want or not,
and I'll just wait.
Has anybody else spent
4,000 bucks on a knife?
Mikael, you asked,
"Who's passionate?"
This is real.
I know how to scale.
No, but passionate,
because you have a lot
of businesses.
You're involved in a lot.
So we need to know
that the person
that steps on board with us
is actually gonna give us
one hour more
than the other brand
you stepped onto.
O'Leary: Mikael, ask any ??
?That's important to us.
?Mikael, who else ??
My entrepreneurs call me
at 4:00 in the morning.
Smart. Smart question.
Mikael, who has spent
$4,000 on a blade?
Moi. Nobody else.
Oza: That's not
your target market.
You got to make a call
here, Mikael.
We're making a call.
Just have a quick chat.
?Yeah.
?You have 30 seconds.
Damn,
you guys grovel enough?
Well, why don't you
make an offer?
[ Laughs ]
?Yeah, that's a good deal.
?I don't beg or grovel.
I'm a [bleep] Shark.
I am not above
doing whatever it takes.
Absolutely.
I'm with you, Lori.
You tell them, Lori.
'cause then me and Marc
will walk out of here ??
?But wait. No, wait.
?Done.
?Wait, wait, wait.
?Done.
Soderlindh: It's closing.
It's closing.
?Let me ?? Let me ??
?It closed. Goodbye.
?It's closed. It's closed.
?[ Laughs ]
Oza: It's closed.
Let me get you
an extra hundred.
?Ah!
?It's closed.
Guys, I could have got you
an extra $100,000.
