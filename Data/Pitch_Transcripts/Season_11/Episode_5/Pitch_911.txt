Higgins: Ooh.
John: Whoa!
Greiner: Alright.
There goes your margin.
There goes your margin.
Hey, I don't hear
any other offers.
Kevin didn't give you
the fine print.
The royalty is forever.
They know that.
Guys, I could blow this up
so big on social.
I'm just worried
you can't do the orders.
I mean,
I got millions of followers.
Well, that's why
we need Sharks ?? to scale it.
Higgins:
So, just to jump in ??
that's a pride thing.
They live it.
John:
You know what?
I'm listening.
John: So, let me
get this straight ??
let me get this straight ??
everybody's out but Kevin,
but you're giving a counter
to Matt?
Okay, Matt, what do you think
about $250,000 at 20%?
Man, we paid
that off already!
John: [ Laughs ]
It's been a long four?year
journey to get to today, Sharks,
but we're ready
for the next chapter...
Together: ...with you!
So, whether you need
to fix a computer...
Or buy a tablet..
Or your kids simply want to play
baseball with your phone...
Together,
we can nerd this...
Or nerd that...
Here at...
Together:
...NERDiT Now.
[ Chuckles ]
Great job.
Whoo?hoo.
I wish you guys
had more energy.
That's what you need.
Nice. Nice.
Well, tell us about the problem
that you're solving.
You said it's hard to figure out
where to go to.
Somebody charges me too much,
but I need to go to them?
What are you doing?
So, right now,
there's a huge amount
of problems that's going on.
Sometimes people don't trust
the people
that you're actually
going to...
Right.
John:
Why take in the money
to then give away
20 to 30 more percent
of all what you've worked
so hard for?
They can just
build it slowly.
Cuban: It's gonna take them
a year to save up the money
to buy
another one of those things,
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Tyler Stuart.
John: I saw that.
I think those sneakers
are amazing.
We got
some fun hats,
Stuart: No, no.
It's alright.
Like Krosky said,
we've done $120,000,
we sold out
really quickly.
We'll do a million dollars
year one with product.
Greiner: Wait, wait. What are
you basing that off of?
How do you know that?
Stuart: We would have to
seriously fumble not to.
Higgins: Yeah.
You're saying you're gonna do
a million this year?
We're gonna do a million dollars
this year.
What does
the kit sell for?
$29. $29.
Stuart: We know
you're not into golf, Mark.
Yeah, if somebody could answer
<i>that</i> question.
Greiner:
It's so relaxing.
You're out with nature.
It's calming.
So is fishing, but you
get something to eat
at the end of the day.
Hey, guys,
you know what?
Here's my general thought
about it.
You want a partner
who obviously is passionate
about that stuff.
I don't relate to this business
at all.
I'm out.
Alright.
Higgins:
I agree with Daymond.
I think if you're gonna invest
in something,
you should at least
have some interest at all.
I have zero interest in golf.
I've played twice in my life.
I wouldn't be a good
partner for you, so for
that reason, I'm out.
Thanks, Matt.
Thanks.
Cool idea, though.
There is crossover
into other sports, too.
What other sports
is there crossover into?
Well, the future version
that we've been working on ??
it can take a pivot.
Stuart:
The cash is helpful
because we're transitioning
to a metal screw in the part.
It's a little different
manufacturing process.
There's gonna be
some setup on that.
Call that $100,000.
The inventory is gonna
start going a lot faster.
That's the key.
Okay.
So, as we were sitting here,
I gave you my offer,
but Mark started
asking questions,
which he has
every right to do,
but my fellow Shark
sitting next to me said,
"You're crazy
with the dollar royalty."
So, our deal
is getting worse?
Back to me, guys.
It's getting worse.
Stuart: In your network,
which we know is awesome,
how do you see it
taking place?
I see this
as targeting golfers.
See how smart she is?
I think it's Instagram ads
all the way.
People need to see this
to get it.
I don't see this
going to retail.
You're gonna make much
more money by selling direct.
Are you doing anything,
Mark?
Wow.
John: Yeah.
Yeah, but when you look into
the space,
there's a lot of competitors
that are selling
inferior products,
less features.
John: We got another offer
over here, guys.
I'd like to make
an offer.
Hey, we got
another offer over here, man.
Mark, we love the
offer. We would like
to hear Kevin's offer.
Okay, I'm out.
I'm out.
John: What the hell?
What happened?
Guys, guys.
Why did you...
Guys, high five.
It was
the same exact deal.
I was about
to make you an offer.
There's value, we think,
in some of the ideas that
she has about lowering cost.
That's something that ??
Hey, what if we do sell
double or triple the units,
