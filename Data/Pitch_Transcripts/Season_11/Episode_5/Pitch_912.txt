We've been working so much
for so long towards this goal.
Just to be here today ??
it feels like
we're champions already.
Interpreter: You just have to
move towards your goal
and just have to keep on going
until you reach your goal.
You know, we've been trying
for so long and then one day,
you can hit it and you can
really become a champ.
My name
is Shaquille Walker,
and I'm the world 800?meter
world record holder.
I'm Jared Ward, 2016 Olympic
marathon runner for Team USA.
And I'm Jono DiPeri,
and I'm...
an engineer.
[ Laughter ]
I'm also the founder and CEO
of our company, MyoStorm,
and we are based
in Provo, Utah.
Sharks, when was the last time
one of you woke up in pain,
with a sore back,
a kink in your neck,
or any other sore spots?
Don't worry.
We'll fix you up in a second.
Well, actually,
it will take several seconds,
but it will be quick,
and believe it or not,
we have all felt pain
and experienced sore muscles.
100 million Americans
report having
DiPeri:
These ones are warmed up.
Ooh.
O'Leary:
They're warm.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
First of all,
we pick it up and it is warm.
Wow.
This thing is hot.
I like the heat.
Walker: Your Meteors
are already on and heated.
If I'm in bed, I'll just put it
on my neck and relax on it,
turn on the heat.
Like that,
Matt.
Yeah.
There you go.
There you go.
Matt's got it figured out.
Thank you.
It's really cool.
I got to give you credit.
The design's good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You got fire.
Thank you.
Tells you it's heat.
It's smart,
so it's global.
Thank you, thank you.
So, did you get
the vibration?
Yeah.
How's it feeling,
Mr. Wonderful?
Fantastic.
I use a roller.
Okay.
I hate the pain,
but it's the gain I go after.
[ Laughs ]
So, one of the things
you'll notice ??
what's nice about rolling
with this is the vibration
is designed to help mask
a little bit of the pain.
So, it's actually
more comfortable
than just using
a traditional roller.
Mark,
do you feel the heat?
Oh, yeah.
[ Groans ]
Ward:
Says it all.
[ Groans ]
Says it all
right there.
He's not afraid
to get in there.
Oh, hell no.
I'm an old pro.
[ Laughs ]
Yep. Yep.
That's pretty cool.
That's nice.
Greiner: Okay.
There's other balls out there.
So, what differentiates you is
the heat and vibrating aspects?
DiPeri: Correct.
My background ?? I was a
mechanical engineering student,
and in my research,
I studied how vibration
affects the human body.
We've learned that there's
really specific frequencies
and amplitudes that are
more therapeutic to the body,
and we've just tried
to optimize it
and add
the addition of heat.
Kind of some background.
We started with
a Kickstarter last September.
We made a small production,
around a thousand units
to fulfill
the Kickstarter backers
and learn if there was anything
we needed to change,
any tweaks, get feedback
from a lot of our athletes.
What was your goal
on Kickstarter and how'd you do?
So, our goal was $20,000.
We did about $70,000.
Wow.
What do you guys
sell these for,
and what does it cost you
to make?
We've tested
between $130 and $175.
We're gonna be
selling them $160.
[ Laughs ]
DiPeri:
We really didn't come in
expecting to get so many offers
from the Sharks.
And it was a really difficult
decision to make,
but we feel amazing.
It really makes you believe in
what you're doing.
It makes it seem
all so worth it.
I don't know
what just happened.
Whoo!
Girl power.
