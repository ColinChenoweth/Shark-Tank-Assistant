Higgins: Ooh.
John: Whoa!
Greiner: Alright.
There goes your margin.
There goes your margin.
Hey, I don't hear
any other offers.
Kevin didn't give you
the fine print.
The royalty is forever.
They know that.
Guys, I could blow this up
so big on social.
I'm just worried
you can't do the orders.
I mean,
I got millions of followers.
Well, that's why
we need Sharks ?? to scale it.
Higgins:
So, just to jump in ??
I understand
this market.
I have the ability
to talk to the customer
that you're targeting
because I'm vice chairman
of Miami Dolphins,
I spend my Sundays
at NFL games,
we have the largest
privately owned
soccer tournament
in the world,
and I know how to talk
to the sports customer
that you're looking
to go after.
What concerns me is that when
you're looking at avid fans,
they are so vested
in their own set?up
that I'm just
not convinced
that there's enough
customers out there
to make that
a very big market,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Oh.
Ooh.
Matt, I think this would be
perfect for you.
We could take this to
the college?football levels,
to NASCAR because
people love their tailgating,
as you know,
and when they have
a custom box
that's whatever football team
that you like,
that's a pride thing.
They live it.
John:
You know what?
You have the gift
and the curse
of I think what all of us have
up here as entrepreneurs.
When you first start out,
you want to be everything
to everybody,
and when you say,
"There's nothing else
out there on the market,"
that makes you want
to keep improving it.
I think you're gonna burn
a lot of capital
trying to keep improving it,
and that's where I'm scared.
So, I'm out.
I'm listening.
John: So, let me
get this straight ??
let me get this straight ??
everybody's out but Kevin,
but you're giving a counter
to Matt?
Okay, Matt, what do you think
about $250,000 at 20%?
Man, we paid
that off already!
John: [ Laughs ]
It's been a long four?year
journey to get to today, Sharks,
but we're ready
for the next chapter...
Together: ...with you!
So, whether you need
to fix a computer...
Or buy a tablet..
Or your kids simply want to play
baseball with your phone...
Together,
we can nerd this...
Or nerd that...
Here at...
Together:
...NERDiT Now.
[ Chuckles ]
Great job.
Whoo?hoo.
I wish you guys
had more energy.
That's what you need.
Nice. Nice.
Well, tell us about the problem
that you're solving.
You said it's hard to figure out
where to go to.
Somebody charges me too much,
but I need to go to them?
What are you doing?
So, right now,
there's a huge amount
of problems that's going on.
Sometimes people don't trust
the people
that you're actually
going to...
Right.
...and a lot of times,
the price is just too high.
We offer free diagnostics,
and we make sure that you know
that we know what we're doing.
All of the work that we do
is covered by our insurance.
I have a lot of experience
in this area
because I have
an 18?year?old daughter
who constantly
breaks her screen.
Yeah.
And we end up
going to the mall ??
those little kiosks ??
and spend about 150 bucks
to do it.
So, are you improving upon
that service?
Yes.
So,
what do you charge?
So, right now,
if you go to a kiosk,
generally, they charge about
$130 for an iPhone 7 repair.
We charge $90
for that same repair...
That's good.
Wow.
...and it comes with
a six?month warranty,
John:
Why take in the money
to then give away
20 to 30 more percent
of all what you've worked
so hard for?
They can just
build it slowly.
Cuban: It's gonna take them
a year to save up the money
to buy
another one of those things,
and he just wanted
to shortcut it.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Tyler Stuart.
And I'm John Krosky.
And we're seeking
$300,000
for 8% of our company,
Golfkicks.
The problem we tackle
is that people are just tired
of golf shoes.
They're ugly,
uncomfortable, expensive.
So, why play golf
in your grandpa's shoes?
Wouldn't it be cool
if you could roll up
to the course
and pull out your favorite pair
of high?tops?
That's why
we created Golfkicks.
We turned
ordinary sneakers
into
extraordinary golf shoes.
Greiner: Wow.
We've had people put Golfkicks
in thousand?dollar sneakers,
flip?flops,
and even cowboy boots.
Let me show you
how this works.
He's grabbed
his favorite pair of kicks,
mapped out the traction
on the bottom,
take your handy
Golfkicks traction kit.
We've already cheated
and put some in.
Screw in the cleat,
and boom,
you've got golf shoes.
We just sold out
of version one,
and we need
your help to grow.
And we got product
for you guys.
But we've got some gear
for you.
Got some gear.
We got FUBU's for you.
John: I saw that.
I think those sneakers
are amazing.
We got
some fun hats,
and we made you all
a pair of kicks.
Here, these are yours
right here, Matt.
Okay.
Thank you.
And one of our kits
is in there.
There you go.
Thank you.
These are ??
Daymond and Mark.
Cuban: Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Greiner: Okay.
I'm a golfer.
Oh, nice.
I think
this is very interesting.
Do I have to drill a hole
into the sole?
So, version one,
which we just sold out of,
we recommend
doing a pilot hole.
You want at least a third
of an inch of a sole thickness,
and you need rubber.
What do you recommend using
to create a pilot hole?
Just anything?
So, we include that
in the kit,
and we actually have
a version coming
that does not even require
a pilot hole.
Are you solving
the problem
of people not wanting
to buy special shoes for golf
or because you want
more style choice?
They want to look cool while
they're out there golfing.
It's the cool factor,
for sure, Mark.
Is there any restriction
on the golf course?
You know, like, you're not
supposed to wear certain things?
There's not.
We've had a few people
comment, right, that,
"They would never allow Vans
at my country club."
Yeah, back in the day, right?
Yeah.
'Cause it's a little bit
punk?rock,
but we think that's part of
the same reason people love it.
O'Leary:
Let's go to distribution
'cause I've looked at many
golf deals over the years,
and it's a very tricky
distribution system
to get to the, you know ??
the pro shops.
That's exactly right.
So, our plan right now ??
and we just got started.
We've only had product
for three months.
We sell direct
on our website.
Some of the next moves
will be Amazon
and get kind of an anchor,
big?box golf retailer,
but we know eventually, it would
be nice to get into the ??
You know
what's extremely scary?
You're just
getting started
and your valuation is
a little over $3 million.
$3.7 million.
So, talk to me.
So, in the last
three months
that we've just started
selling product,
we've already done
$120,000.
Oh!
That makes sense!
[ Laughter ]
A cool $5 million.
Sorry for asking.
[ Laughter ]
Stuart: No, no.
It's alright.
Like Krosky said,
we've done $120,000,
we sold out
really quickly.
We'll do a million dollars
year one with product.
Greiner: Wait, wait. What are
you basing that off of?
How do you know that?
Stuart: We would have to
seriously fumble not to.
Higgins: Yeah.
You're saying you're gonna do
a million this year?
We're gonna do a million dollars
this year.
What does
the kit sell for?
$29. $29.
That's cool. And what does
it cost you to make?
Five bucks.
That's even better.
Is anybody
knocking you off already?
Both: No.
Do you have a patent
on anything?
We do.
So, we filed
the provisional 2018.
We just did our non?provisional
May 8, 2019.
So, nobody else
has a patent out there
where you're anchoring a cleat
into a shoe yourself?
That's right.
We have good mojo
on the patent side so far.
I got another question.
Why does anybody play golf?
'Cause I hate it.
Because of those.
Greiner:
I love it.
I would second that.
I love it.
I hate it.
I hate it.
Stuart: We know
you're not into golf, Mark.
Yeah, if somebody could answer
<i>that</i> question.
Greiner:
It's so relaxing.
You're out with nature.
It's calming.
So is fishing, but you
get something to eat
at the end of the day.
Hey, guys,
you know what?
Here's my general thought
about it.
You want a partner
who obviously is passionate
about that stuff.
I don't relate to this business
at all.
I'm out.
Alright.
Higgins:
I agree with Daymond.
I think if you're gonna invest
in something,
you should at least
have some interest at all.
I have zero interest in golf.
I've played twice in my life.
I wouldn't be a good
partner for you, so for
that reason, I'm out.
Thanks, Matt.
Thanks.
Cool idea, though.
There is crossover
into other sports, too.
What other sports
is there crossover into?
Well, the future version
that we've been working on ??
it can take a pivot.
It can take a high?speed
starting and stopping.
So, it'll help you get into
soccer, et cetera.
Soccer or, like, kids,
for example.
Have you ever noticed
how fast kids' shoes wear out?
Or they outgrow them,
right?
O'Leary:
Okay. I'm a golfer.
I'm looking at it saying,
"I wish it wasn't 300K,"
'cause it's a product.
It's not really
a company yet.
I mean, the golf?shoe market's
an $8 1/2 billion market.
Look, I'm not saying it's bad.
It's interesting.
But the way you structured
the deal makes it hard
for me to maneuver.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
Alright.
Cuban: What do you guys
need specifically?
The mentorship
is a huge part of it.
Some advisers
as we go into Amazon,
as we go into retail.
Listen, you're brand?new.
You're just starting, alright?
You don't even have down
the final iteration,
which I would think
you have that coming any day.
I'm gonna give you
an offer
based on how much risk
I think there is here.
I'll give you the $300,000
as a loan at 8% interest,
but I want a royalty
of a dollar per.
I will stop the royalty
once I get paid back,
and I'll take
5% of the company.
Okay.
Appreciate that.
Lori, why you going so low
on the royalty?
You see their margins?
Stuart:
The cash is helpful
because we're transitioning
to a metal screw in the part.
It's a little different
manufacturing process.
There's gonna be
some setup on that.
Call that $100,000.
The inventory is gonna
start going a lot faster.
That's the key.
Okay.
So, as we were sitting here,
I gave you my offer,
but Mark started
asking questions,
which he has
every right to do,
but my fellow Shark
sitting next to me said,
"You're crazy
with the dollar royalty."
So, our deal
is getting worse?
Back to me, guys.
It's getting worse.
So I will tell you,
while you sit and wait,
while I love you
and I'm one with the golf ??
Well, that's what happens
when you're not decisive.
It's gonna get worse.
I'm one with the golf,
but now I'm going to $2 per.
Stuart: In your network,
which we know is awesome,
how do you see it
taking place?
I see this
as targeting golfers.
See how smart she is?
I think it's Instagram ads
all the way.
People need to see this
to get it.
I don't see this
going to retail.
You're gonna make much
more money by selling direct.
Are you doing anything,
Mark?
Yeah. I'm trying not
to be rude and interrupt.
Okay, let him get
his offer out, Lori.
Go ahead, Mark.
Guys,
I'll make you an offer.
$300,000 for 15%.
No royalties.
Once you get into
the kids' sports,
that's where
I think your grand slam is.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
The kids' thing's huge.
That's my offer.
You guys can say yes or no.
Wow.
John: Yeah.
Yeah, but when you look into
the space,
there's a lot of competitors
that are selling
inferior products,
less features.
That are heated
and vibrate?
That <i>don't</i> heat.
What's it cost you
to make?
$40 landed.
So, some of these products
cost $600,
and then at the lower end,
obviously,
you have
your $15 foam roller,
but this really is
a superior product
at a more affordable
price range,
and, I mean,
consider how much you paid
for your last massage.
Guys, I'm gonna just
tell you the biggest
differentiator, right?
When you have a roller,
vibrating or otherwise,
you got to get
on the floor, right?
Yeah.
Or against a wall.
Yeah.
And that just limits,
whereas here,
you know,
laying on bed,
you don't need to have
a hard surface underneath
this like you do
with the roller.
Exactly.
Higgins: So, once again, how
many units have you sold?
So, we've sold total
about 900 units.
So,
what are total sales?
Greiner: So, what are
your total sales?
So, total sales,
with the Kickstarter,
is about $120,000.
John: We got another offer
over here, guys.
I'd like to make
an offer.
Hey, we got
another offer over here, man.
Mark, we love the
offer. We would like
to hear Kevin's offer.
Okay, I'm out.
I'm out.
John: What the hell?
What happened?
Guys, guys.
Why did you...
Guys, high five.
It was
the same exact deal.
I was about
to make you an offer.
There's value, we think,
in some of the ideas that
she has about lowering cost.
That's something that ??
Hey, what if we do sell
double or triple the units,
and that's something we can work
on ?? getting our costs down.
Okay, roll your asses
out of here.
Guys,
I'm really disappointed.
Yeah, I want to throw the ball
at you now!
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: Good choice,
gentlemen.
Thanks.
I will not
let you down.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Alright, man.
