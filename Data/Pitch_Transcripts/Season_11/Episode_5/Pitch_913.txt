Taylor: Hi, Sharks.
I'm Taylor.
I'm Ron.
My name is Kobe,
Taylor: Okay.
One ??
what does it weigh?
75 pounds on the large box,
55 on the small box.
Okay.
Ron: Yes.
You guys
had a problem,
you came up
with a solution,
you turned it
into a business,
you saved your money
to be able to do it yourself
without
any outside help.
Right.
You are
the American dream.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Cuban: I mean,
that's incredible.
That's the good news.
[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
The bad news is,
I don't glamp.
It's just
not a fit for me.
Ron: Right.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out,
but congratulations,
guys.
It's just awesome,
awesome, awesome
what
you've accomplished.
Taylor: Okay.
Okay.
Thanks for your time,
guys.
Congratulations, guys.
What a great experience.
Greiner: It's very cool.
You did a great job.
Good luck.
You guys
could have countered.
It doesn't hurt
to ask.
The Johnson family

Thank you.

Thanks.
O'Leary: Now, Matt,
what's very important here
is now that you've learned
how to structure deals
from Mr. Wonderful, I will be
sending you an invoice.
So, right now,
we have a storefront,
we have a mobile store,
which is this ambulance,
but we can't have the ambulance
in multiple locations.
So, we see maybe eight repairs
in a two?hour period.
So, this kiosk
plus ambulance model
actually allows us
to scale that.
One ambulance can service
as many as 10 kiosks.
Higgins: Is it
a huge national business?
It's basically like the Uber
for screen repair,
where they have
independent contractors?
I think there's nothing wrong
with the business for you guys.
I wanted to see a big
roll?out strategy on trucks
You're our astronauts, Sharks.
This is our everything.
We're gonna take this
to the moon.
Listen, guys,
I just don't personally think
that you should take
an investment in it,
to be very honest.
I love that
when I'm sleeping,
the register's still ringing,
you know?
FUBU is still selling
at any minute of the day.
I don't have to
physically hire other people
Nothing wrong with that.
It's just not really investable.
Kev, give me two scoops
with some sprinkles, please.
Vanilla or strawberry?
[ Chuckles ]
chronic neck or back pain
in the U. S. alone.
$600 billion are spent annually

As a professional athlete,
I experience pain every day.
No, here's why
that's wrong. Lori ??
Alright, here's one thing
that I would gather for sure.
If it was
under a hundred dollars,
you'd do better.
No.
It is always ?? No.
Mark,
don't even go there.
Nope.
There is always
a price?point freezing
Yeah.
But because
it's an electronics good
