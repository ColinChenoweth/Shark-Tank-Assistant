"Shark Tank" has been at
the forefront of innovation...
And now I'm here, man.
For me, this is
the American dream already.
I think that watching
"Shark Tank" as a kid
helped me be standing
in front of you all today.
Narrator:
...showcasing America's
most ingenious products
and trendsetting ideas.
There you go.
[ Chuckles ]
Whoo?hoo!
And tonight, CEO of RSE Ventures
and vice chairman
of the Miami Dolphins
Matt Higgins
returns to the Tank.
I understand this market.
I have the ability
to talk to the customer
that you're targeting.
Just when you think
you've seen it all...
Whoo!
...there's always something new
coming in the Tank.
Which of these companies
will be the next big idea?
The future starts now.
[ Electricity crackling ]
Taylor: Hi, Sharks.
I'm Taylor.
I'm Ron.
My name is Kobe,
and we're from
Grand Junction, Colorado.
And we are seeking $250,000
for 10% of our company
that will revolutionize
the outdoors forever.
Have you ever
unpacked your campsite
and realized you forgot
something important,
like salt, oil,
or a spatula?
Does your picnic table
look like this?
Taylor: Okay.
One ??
what does it weigh?
75 pounds on the large box,
55 on the small box.
Okay.
And then we have
new products coming where,
when they're in plastic,
they're gonna be much lighter.
So, what does it cost
to ship that, then?
Around $120, $150.
You have any patents?
We have two patents.
They're both provisional
utility patents ??
on the railing here,
how we can put everything
in the slots, on aluminum,
and what's most important ??
roto?mold plastic.
Guys,
these aren't cheap to build,
particularly when
you're starting
and making mistakes
and iterating.
How much money
have you invested?
Have you raised
any outside capital?
No.
So, what we did ??
we took our savings.
I got $250,000 invested
in this entire process.
We're real tight
with the money...
Good.
...and one of the reasons
we're here
is because we don't want
to make a mistake
at the first product.
Why is this business worth
$2 1/2 million?
You know I have to ask
that question...
Yes.
Yes, you do.
...and I'm doing it
in the nicest way.
If I don't like the answer,
then things get ugly.
With the patents
that we have,
there's no other product
like this,
and I feel
we have this window
to take over
the whole outdoor.
I don't think
I like that answer enough.
We need to scale this puppy,
and we need to scale it fast.
And what is the $250,000
gonna be used for?
Inventory.
Just product.
Before, you said
you could bring the cost down
by going to plastic,
including the entry?level unit
of $1,000?
So, you're bringing that down
to what price point?
Well, yeah, our cost on that
is around $748.
We can bring that down
in the $300, $200 range.
So, you're retailing it
for $750 or something?
If we scale.
To scale.
If we scale
and source.
We're completely in Colorado
right now,
so we can get
those prices down...
even in America,
I'm sure.
But, you know, being in
Colorado's not a bad thing,
but first,
let me say this ??
you know,
there's an old saying ??
"Necessity is
the mother of invention."
Ron: Yes.
You guys
had a problem,
you came up
with a solution,
you turned it
into a business,
you saved your money
to be able to do it yourself
without
any outside help.
Right.
You are
the American dream.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Cuban: I mean,
that's incredible.
That's the good news.
[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
The bad news is,
I don't glamp.
It's just
not a fit for me.
Ron: Right.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out,
but congratulations,
guys.
It's just awesome,
awesome, awesome
what
you've accomplished.
Taylor: Okay.
Okay.
Thanks for your time,
guys.
Congratulations, guys.
What a great experience.
Greiner: It's very cool.
You did a great job.
Good luck.
You guys
could have countered.
It doesn't hurt
to ask.
The Johnson family
rejected Kevin's offer
of $250,000 as a line of credit
for 10% equity
and a royalty of $100 per
unit sold of Tailgate N Go.
You guys could have countered.
It doesn't hurt to ask.
Taylor:
Thank you.
Alright.
How you doing?
Congrats, guys.
Thanks.
O'Leary: Now, Matt,
what's very important here
is now that you've learned
how to structure deals
from Mr. Wonderful, I will be
sending you an invoice.
has now grown to two storefronts
and the Motherboard.
A mobile device
repair ambulance.
When you get hurt,
you call 911.
When your device gets hurt,
you call us.
And don't forget about
our remote kiosk,
where you can drop off
a broken device
and we'll fix it for you
in six hours.
Wait...same day?
Same day.
You don't even
have to talk to a human.
You see, Sharks, we're doing
everything to make this work.
I mean, I even took my wife
and my 4?month?old baby
and moved back in
with my in?laws.
Typical millennial,
right?
I left my engineering career
behind for this.
And I put $20,000
on my credit card.
and we do all of the repairs
in front of you.
The ambulance
comes <i>to</i> the person?
It can.
It can?
We have
a brick?and?mortar store, too.
How many of these
vending machines do you have?
So, currently, this is a
prototype that we just created.
Okay.
We came up with this idea
about three months ago,
and we're working on a software
right now.
So, right now,
we have a storefront,
we have a mobile store,
which is this ambulance,
but we can't have the ambulance
in multiple locations.
So, we see maybe eight repairs
in a two?hour period.
So, this kiosk
plus ambulance model
actually allows us
to scale that.
One ambulance can service
as many as 10 kiosks.
Higgins: Is it
a huge national business?
It's basically like the Uber
for screen repair,
where they have
independent contractors?
So, there is no national brand.
That's actually the opportunity.
No one has created
a national brand
where they actually
trust it.
They have
these mall kiosks.
Sure,
you have Geek Squad,
but they want to be a service
provider for everything.
They'll do
your home appliance,
they'll do whatever.
So, they don't have
a niche market
that they're actually isolating
device repair.
That's what
we're gonna do.
Tell me how many people
are going to feel okay about
putting their laptop
or their iPad or whatever,
their phone
into this refrigerator
and just
leaving it there.
So,
what we plan on doing
is actually starting testing
markets with the Motherboard.
The Motherboard?
The Motherboard
is our ambulance.
The Motherboard actually
tests the market first.
We go there and build the trust
within the organization
that we're partnering with
as the host organization,
and once people start feeling
as if they can trust us,
we then place
a kiosk there.
That's tough, guys.
What was your history
before this?
Myself,
at 12 years old,
a teacher gave me
a computer,
and when he gave me that
computer, it changed my life.
I end up going to a high school
where I became
a Microsoft?certified systems
engineer by 17 years old.
Wow.
I then went off to college,
graduated with my degrees,
then went to China for
five years, where I started...
Cuban: [ Chuckles ]
...working for
an import?export company.
I opened up a bar
while I was running ??
In China?
In China.
You speak Chinese?
Um...
[ Speaks Chinese ]
Oh [speaks Chinese]
Oh.
[ Laughs ]
Well, can I just tell you ??
I'm a Microsoft?certified
systems engineer.
Hey!
And I also
opened up a bar, so...
We're there.
[ Chuckles ]
What are the other
two guys' histories?
So, my history is born
and raised in Delaware,
graduated from
the University of Delaware.
What was your degree?
Finance.
Yeah, I knew you were
the financial guy.
I also went to
the University of Delaware.
I have
a civil engineering degree.
I left the engineering industry
behind a few years ago.
What do you want to do
with the $150,000?
So, with the $150,000,
what we plan on doing
is buying two more Motherboards
so that
we can test the markets
both in Philadelphia
and Baltimore,
want to buy 10 kiosks,
as well as finish the
development of the software.
So, when you figure out where
you put the Motherboards, right,
how does that
all work out?
And then you send out an alert
telling people,
"This is where
we're gonna be today"?
We join
other food?truck circuits.
Smart.
So, where the food trucks go,
we go.
That's how we got into
a lot of organizations.
Oh, that's interesting.
That's interesting.
What are your sales?
I don't think we heard.
Year to date,
$74,000.
Sale forecasted this year
to make about $250,000.
What did you do
last year?
Last year was $157,000.
I just want
to try to help you out
'cause I don't feel like
you've done a good enough job
explaining the potential
of a Motherboard.
How much revenue
can one do?
Generally,
for the ambulance right now,
when we do a 5?day period,
it's about $30,000 a month.
That's good
if you can do it.
Hey, guys, look,
this is a great business
for you guys, right?
I've been there.
But it's still driven
by proximity.
You got to go
where the people are at,
and it's driven
by your time.
You have to have somebody
physically doing that work,
so it's hard to scale.
I've been there.
And so, while it's
a great business for you guys
'cause you can just grind it
and go and grow it
and make more and more money
that goes into your pocket,
it's not
really investable.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
You know, I think
that if you were, like,
in a Kinko's,
in a FedEx,
in locations where you just
need to be in people's faces,
and then to me,
the marketing angle is,
"We will fix your phone screen
in 20 minutes."
It's like
pull up and go, right?
If you can be in enough places
where people can see that,
of course
I'd go to you.
It's easy.
Love your story,
think it's amazing.
You're brilliant,
so you'll go far.
But you're at
an early stage,
and I don't think
I'm the right partner.
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
O'Leary: Guys, I don't think
this is investable.
I really don't.
I think there's nothing wrong
with the business for you guys.
I wanted to see a big
roll?out strategy on trucks
that had a really high return,
and I didn't get that.
So, I'm sorry,
I'm out.
Thank you.
I have a way that we're gonna
scale this company,
and if you don't believe
in anything else,
you best believe in us.
We're taking this
to the moon.
We're not asking for you guys
to work for us,
and we don't necessarily
want to work for you.
We want the money
to work for everybody
so that we can take you
to the moon.
You're our astronauts, Sharks.
This is our everything.
We're gonna take this
to the moon.
Listen, guys,
I just don't personally think
that you should take
an investment in it,
to be very honest.
I love that
when I'm sleeping,
the register's still ringing,
you know?
FUBU is still selling
at any minute of the day.
I don't have to
physically hire other people
and do things like that,
so I just don't think
it's investable.
So I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks, Daymond.
Who's left?
Matt?
Yep.
You have invented
this very clever,
well?branded truck
and are able
to put it somewhere
with no occupancy cost,
and you're able
to generate enough volume
that you can charge and undercut
your competition.
That's a brilliant idea.
My advice to you ??
continue to scale that.
Save up the money to go ahead
and buy a second truck.
It's a smart model.
There's an endless need
to replace screens,
so you're
onto something.
I just think you're here
a little bit too early.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Sharks.
Cuban:
You know what?
You didn't get a deal, but just
go out and prove us wrong.
Higgins: Alright,
good luck.
Bye.
Good luck, guys.
Nothing wrong with that.
It's just not really investable.
Kev, give me two scoops
with some sprinkles, please.
Vanilla or strawberry?
[ Chuckles ]
chronic neck or back pain
in the U. S. alone.
$600 billion are spent annually
managing pain just like this.
As a professional athlete,
I experience pain every day.
I blew thousands of dollars
on recovery equipment,
but nothing produced
the results I needed.
I felt the same way as Shaq.
We both knew...
Together:
...there had to be a better way.
And that's why
we invented the Meteor.
The Meteor is
a patent?pending,
FDA?compliant
medical massage device
that utilizes
cutting?edge technology
in vibration
and heat therapy
to help reduce pain
and speed up muscular recovery.
The Meteor's versatile
and easy to use.
Just use like
any traditional roller,
combining the benefits
of pressure from rolling out
with the Meteor's addition
of heat and vibration.
You can use it
while lying down
or sitting in a chair
or just holding it and applying
pressure wherever it's sore.
The Meteor was designed with
professional athletes in mind...
But it can be used by
and benefit everyone
who experiences pain.
So, Sharks, whether you just
finished running 26.2 miles...
Are recovering
from an injury...
Or just slept weird...
...the Meteor
can benefit you.
We are seeking $150,000
for 10% of our company.
So, Sharks...
Together:
Who's ready to roll with us?
Greiner:
Can we get samples?
Yeah.
Good news ??
we brought gifts for you.
Cool.
Oh, good.
Here you go.
Awesome.
Red for you.
I'll go black.
Yep, take a box.
Go ahead and take the box.
Greiner: Ooh.
No, here's why
that's wrong. Lori ??
Alright, here's one thing
that I would gather for sure.
If it was
under a hundred dollars,
you'd do better.
No.
It is always ?? No.
Mark,
don't even go there.
Nope.
There is always
a price?point freezing
at $50
and at a hundred.
Yeah. Yeah.
And when you are under $50,
you sell way better,
and when you're under a hundred,
you sell way better,
and that is proven time
and again.
The goal
is to maximize profit.
Lori, if they go 50% margin
and they go to retail,
then it will be $160.
Is your plan
to go to retail?
Higgins: By the way,
do you have a vision?
You're gonna go
direct?to?consumer
as long as possible?
Or do you want
to go to retail?
So, the plan was
to stay direct?to?consumer.
We are interested
in retail.
We'd probably start
with specialty, you know?
Here's why it works
at a higher price.
And $169's relatively high,
higher than I expected,
because the people
who get this off the bat
are already using
other options, right?
They're already educated and
they see the perceived value.
Yeah.
But because
it's an electronics good
and because
you're an engineer,
you're gonna continue
to optimize it.
You might make it a little
bit smaller because it
fits in little places,
you'll push the cost down,
right?
And once you get the cost
down to $20,
then you can come out
with a $99 version.
With scaling, we already expect
it to come down dramatically.
How far
can you get the price?
So, right now,
with our current manufacturers,
they said they can get it down
to $27.
At what volumes?
10,000.
At 10,000.
Which would then
allow you, then,
to be under a hundred,
for sure.
That's a lot of volume.
Guys,
I love the product.
I'm tired of wasting time
with all these guys, right?
Well, wait, Mark,
I was about to make an offer.
That's why.
I'm the only
fine?tuned athlete up here.
Listen, guys,
here's what I'll do ??
I'll give you 250K
for 20%, right?
So, that gives you
the capital you need.
Obviously,
I can help you get it out there,
but if you want to hear
all the options, I don't
want to waste my time.
O'Leary: You should listen
to other options.
I'll just take a nap.
You guys let me know.
If you want me in
for $250,000 for 20% ??
You're letting him bully you
like that.
Don't get bullied
by Mark.
Just let me know and
if not, I'll let you
play with the masses.
Higgins: Mark, Mark, Mark.
Just let him bully you, huh?
