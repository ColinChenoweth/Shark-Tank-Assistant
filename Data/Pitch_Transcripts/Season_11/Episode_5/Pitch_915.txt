We're from Wilmington, Delaware,
and I'm Markevis Gideon.
I'm Jonathan Hoxter.
And I'm Jake Voorhees.
And we're here asking
for $150,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company.

All: And this is why we started
NERDiT Now.
Not a day goes by
that you don't hear about it.
Post?Traumatic
Screen Disorder.
It's on the rise.
It's an epidemic.
And it's not like
once you break your device,
you can
fix it yourself.
Nope.
Companies don't want
to fix it for you.
They want you
to buy a new one.
But...
Together:
...we're the nerds.
And we can fix anything.
Here at NERDiT Now,
we purchase, repair,
and resell computers,
phones, and tablets.
See, what started
out of my two?bedroom apartment
