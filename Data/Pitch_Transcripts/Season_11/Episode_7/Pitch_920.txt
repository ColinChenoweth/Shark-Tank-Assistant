My name is Lisa Nguyen,
Introducing
Baubles + Soles.
Our patent?pending,
interchangeable shoes
allow your little one
to customize that perfect pair.
Whether it's adorable piggies
for a playdate...
[ Laughter ]
Or pompoms
for that perfect party,
with Baubles + Soles,
one shoe equals
endless possibilities.
Good work, Audrey.
Thank you so much.
Herjavec: Oh, so cute!
So, Duc is actually gonna
show you how to use this.
Duc: You put three fingers
inside as a support.
When Kaia
was 10 months old,
she had this pair of shoes
that somebody had given her,
Duc: It cost us,
with the packaging, about $11.
We sell them retail
for $49.95...

Lisa,
what's your background?
So, we actually ??
Herjavec: Lisa, I ??
Sorry. Let ?? Can I ??
Lisa, I really respect
your story.
I think when you come from
those kind of circumstances ??
I mean, you start
from the bottom,
you can only go up.
Um...
Can I just say, we only need
to make 300 pairs per go?
Our hold on inventory
is not ??
Per what?
So, every time
they injection?mold,
300 pairs minimum.
I have to be
transparent with you.
I don't love it.
I think
it's a cute product,
but what really concerns me is,
in a year,
you've really only sold $30,000
through your website.
But, Lisa,
that's the challenge, right?
Can I add one more thing
before you ??
Sure.
So, one of the things
that we're doing
to grow
our direct?to?consumer ??
So, what you guys have
is a great product,
but it's not
obviously different.
This is
a demonstrable product.
Last month, our returning?
customer rate was 46%.
So we know that when we get
a customer, they come back.
They come back
for more baubles,
but Lisa is not
giving up easily
in trying to get a deal
for her interchangeable
kids shoe company,
Baubles + Soles.
Could we de?risk it?
Can you what?
Can I de?risk it?
So, for $100,000...
How do you de?risk it?
...how about if we pay you
that back in two years
from the revenue that we make
from the profits that we make?
I know this company's
going to work,
This product
is gonna be huge.
Let's see how Radiate
is doing now.
to introduce our product
to a whole new audience.
Why can I not
think of an invention?
Robert was able to introduce us
to major retailers
You don't have to have
a big education.
All you got to do
is have the desire
but this is
a much different product.
because we have to produce
such little at a time
due to lack of funds.
Would you do T?shirts,
though?
Absolutely
we can do T?shirts.
Of course.
Absolutely.
I smell an offer
coming from Mark.
Let me tell you
where I'm at.
I can't get my head around
dressing up a dog.
I just can't get there.
I'm not saying there isn't
a market or people won't do it.
It's just, I can't do it.
I'm out.
Introducing
The Yard Milkshake Bar.
Wow.
We're what ice cream dreams
are made of.
We have unicorns.
We have mermaids.
So, if I want
to open one up ??
As long as
we buy their product,
they get all of
their equipment for free.
So, how many do you have
in total?
We personally have four
that we own,
I think
the product's fantastic.
So, I'll offer you
the $400,000.
It would be
for the inclusive,
because when I'm in,
I want to really be all?in.
