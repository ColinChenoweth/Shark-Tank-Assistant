We are from Huntington Beach,
California,
and we're here
seeking $100,000
for 15% equity
in our company.
Sharks, if you have kids,
like us,
then you know one of
the biggest challenges
of keeping up
with their wardrobe
is that they are
constantly growing.
You find
that perfect pair of shoes,
they wear it out
once or twice,
and then
just like that...
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
They've already
outgrown them.
So we thought,
"What if we could invent
one shoe that could be styled
with every single outfit
in the wardrobe?"
Sharks,
that's exactly what we did.
align it 90 degrees,
and then twist clockwise.
Sorry.
Greiner: Clockwise.
Clockwise.
Cuban: Ta?da!
?Yay!
?Oh, I see.
Push it down
and then twist anti?clockwise
to take it out.
Okay. Anti?clockwise.
Got it.
?Bye.
?Bye, guys.
Bye?bye!
Bye!
?Bye.
?Bye.
How did you
come up with the idea?
Sure. So, like a lot
of businesses owned by mom,
it was inspired
by my first daughter.
Then we resettled to Australia,
where I grew up ??
and hence the accent.
Oh, wow.
In Australia,
I got into law school.
I worked in banking and finance
for a short while
and then just realized,
you know,
"Life has to be more
extraordinary than this."
So I gave that all up,
and I went to the Philippines
to volunteer to do
pro bono legal work.
So, we helped refugees
like us.
Wow.
Then was offered,
after a year,
a full?time job
as the executive director
of a nonprofit.
So I moved
to Washington, D. C.,
and that's how
I came to America.
John:
We've had a lot of people
who went through
tough situations.
I don't think we've ever
heard of somebody...
A refugee. Yeah.
...that went to a refugee camp,
that lived there.
It's an amazing story.
So you know that she's
gonna be a hard worker.
Immigrants get it done,
right?
[ Laughs ] Yeah.
Okay,
what are your sales?
In the last 12 months,
we have made $150,000.
How did you sell that?
So,
we have our website.
A lot of our business
is actually wholesale
and international
distribution.
So, actually, 80% of
our business right now
is to wholesale
overseas.
80% is to wholesale?
Is to wholesale.
This year, we're projected
to do $300,000.
Yeah.
And our predicted profit
is about $170,000.
So, guys,
what are you looking for?
We are looking for
a strategic partner.
We see a huge opportunity
here in America.
John:
So, this is challenging for me
because this is
an inventory challenge
you're gonna have.
You're gonna have
a nightmare with that
because
you have to stock up
on so many sizes,
so many colors,
and then
so many more accessories.
And in my business,
the thing that has killed
more people than the plague
has been inventory.
I really love your story,
but, unfortunately, I'm out.
Oh, Daymond.
with a realistic valuation ??
just over $600,000.
I think you've built
$600,000 worth of value.
We're here for the deal.
And I appreciate that
because ??
We've been offered
other investments,
and we've just said no to them
because this is ??
we're here for you guys.
I mean ??
No, I understand that,
and I appreciate it.
And that's apparent.
That's apparent.
This was a really
remarkable presentation,
I must say,
and a good valuation.
Very good.
So the question
becomes,
"Do I want to be
in the shoe business?"
You know, I've learned
a lot about shoes
on "Shark Tank"
over a decade.
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
I just don't want to be
in the shoe business,
not because you haven't done
a spectacular job presenting.
I'm hopeful
that Lori's still here,
and she likes
a lot of plastic stuff.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you,
Mr. Wonderful.
with Night Lights events,
a company that specializes
in lantern release festivals
across the U. S.
Alright,
who needs a Radiate?!
I invested in Radiate
'cause I love the guys
or TV personalities
that you're thinking of.
that matched his humanlike
personality anywhere.
Every store I went in,
it was really cheap
and tacky clothing.
And we thought to ourselves,
<i>"I</i> wouldn't wear that,
so why would we dress Thomas
in that?"
Where is Thomas?
Dead?
So ??
[ Laughter ]
I was just asking.
That was a bit harsh,
but...
Thomas, who you can see
here in our pictures ??
he was our ??
Herjavec: Bye. Bye!
?Bye.
?[ Laughs ]
He was our ??
[ Laughter ]
Thomas was our firstborn child,
if you will.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, he passed away
this last Christmas.
Sorry.
Oh, Kevin!
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Chelsea.
And I'm Logan.
And I'm Ali.
And we're seeking $400,000
for 10% of our company.
Sharks, close your eyes
and imagine
you are 7 years old again
and dreaming
of a magical place.
Are you swimming
with the mermaids?
Are you riding
a unicorn?
Are you eating
a giant jar of ice cream?
Now open your eyes.
It's ice cream?
We made that magical place
come to life.
Logan: So, Sharks...
All: Who wants to shake it up
with us at The Yard?
?Shake it up.
?Alright.
Chelsea: We have some samples
for everyone.
And, Mark, I'm gonna invite you
to design your own.
Oy.
I'm afraid already.
Mark's lactose?intolerant,
so he'll be ??
Yeah, so just don't stand
behind me.
[ Laughter ]
Everyone is
going to get a milkshake.
Ahh! What do we got?
What do we got?
So, we picked
an ice cream for you.
Cool.
But first, we're gonna
decorate your jar.
Everybody gets to take
the jar home with them
once they buy it.
And the first thing we choose
is your icing.
So, we have chocolate icing,
vanilla icing, peanut butter.
Chocolate.
Chocolate for sure?
Everybody gets to either
choose to build their own ??
our menus allow you
to choose what you want ??
or you can choose from one of
our pre?designed milkshakes.
So, someone's standing
behind the bar.
So, I'm walking through
kind of like a yogurt store
where you pick and choose
or do I do it myself?
We have menus that you actually
fill out yourself.
Wait.
What are these, again?
Those are peanuts.
We can put some on top
for you, if you'd like.
No, let's get
some of the chips.
Yeah, a little bit
of everything.
Okay.
We can definitely put
all that on top for you.
Yeah, put it all on!
If you're gonna go,
go hard.
No calories there,
kiddies.
Chelsea: Chocolate drizzle
on the inside.
Chocolate drizzle
on the inside!
Oh, you are going
to SoulCycle later.
I can already see it.
Robert, this is
our Old School Banana Split.
?Holy smokes.
?Wow.
You get to choose one of these
large toppings to go on.
Oh, I'll go with the brownie
since we're doing chocolate.
Perfect choice.
[ Laughs ]
Alright,
and this is yours.
Oh, my gosh.
That looks amazing.
Herjavec: Looks so good.
Should we wait?
?No. Hell no.
?You can go ahead.
Hell no.
Logan: Kevin.
Is that a brownie
on top?
A blondie.
Wow!
That's crazy.
Kevin, you have
a hazelnut ice cream.
It's dark chocolate
with hazelnut inside of it.
?It's good.
?Oh, my ?? Lori, look at this.
Chelsea: And then for Daymond ??
for you, we have a mint.
Greiner: Honestly,
your chocolate is great.
Herjavec: It's so thick.
Wow.
That's really good.
Yeah.
So rich.
Really good.
Oh, it's so good!
How many calories
does this have in it?
Don't tell me!
Chelsea: Ours range from
650 calories to our most ??
our highest?calorie one
is 1,800 calories.
?1,800.
?1,800?!
Alone. [ Laughs ]
Herjavec: Why is it
called The Yard?
The milkshakes bring
all the boys to the yard.
Yeah, Chelsea,
great call.
[ Laughter ]
What does
a milkshake cost,
and what does it cost you
to make?
The milkshakes retail
for $14 to $20,
depending on
which one ??
$14 to $20?
It's a great price, though,
for that.
We do have a larger size,
and the Shake Boss you see
there, the big one ?? it's $50.
?Wow.
?$50?
?$50?
?Average ticket item's $25.
Greiner: And what does it cost
to make one?
$4 to $9,
depending on the size.
Why'd you come up with
this idea? What's your history?
And, you know ??
My first ice cream shop,
I started with my mom
in 2010,
and then in 2017,
when we opened The Yard,
we had an opportunity
to go into a spot
who had multiple failed
ice cream shops in it before.
So we knew we had to come up
with something really exciting,
like, really extravagant
to get people coming in.
Chelsea,
what town are you in?
Gulf Shores, Alabama,
was our first location.
What is <i>your</i> history?
Because ??
Logan: My father owned an
electrical contracting company.
We started from scratch.
He worked us
like any dad works you.
Learned the ethic
from him, for sure.
And Ali's story
is what?
Ali,
what's your background?
We're married,
and this is our sister?in?law.
This is chief of operations
Ali Rose Green.
Ali is my sister?in?law,
and she decided
to come work for us
when we opened The Yard,
just lines out the door.
We couldn't keep up
with the demand.
You said "multiple units."
Where are your other units?
Yeah, 'cause you started
to grow, you said, right?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, we have
went into franchising now.
So, our first location
was Gulf Shores in 2017, May.
Our second location
was in Panama City Beach,
which is about
three hours away,
and that was the following year,
in 2018.
We also opened a store
in Fairhope, Alabama.
We also have a store
in Austin, Texas.
Walk me through
the franchise deal.
What do I pay you?
So, the franchise license is
$45,000 for a 10?year license.
We take a 6% continuing royalty
of net sales.
We also take a 2% royalty
for national marketing.
?So the total royalty's 8%?
?Yes.
What are the margins
on your best store ??
for you,
the corporate store?
25% to 28%.
Yes. Thank you.
Wow, that's really good.
Yeah, it's excellent.
What's sales
on a good store?
$1,400,000.
?Wow!
?Wow!
How many
square feet?
We started out
in 1,000 square feet.
What's that store,
the one that's doing 1.4?
How many square feet?
That's the same store.
We upgraded it last year
to 3,500 square feet.
All the extra space
is seating for the customers?
Yes.
Oh, it's a sit?down restaurant.
Are they all sit?down?
No.
It's a milkshake bar.
It is.
So, they'll come in.
We have a menu.
They'll fill out the menu.
They check the items
they like,
and then they give it
to our assembly team,
and we have
specialized decorators.
So this is like Chipotle.
Correct, yes. It's ice cream
any way you can think of it.
But why is it so big ??
3,500 square feet?
Well, Gulf Shores
is a seasonal town,
so we have to have
that square footage
to pack as much volume
in there
during that busy season
as possible.
If I'm a potential buyer,
what does it cost me to open,
start to finish?
Anywhere from $140,000
to, say, $315,000.
And how many square feet
do I have to open ??
No. Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Including the license fee.
So, we have
a lease agreement, almost,
with our ice cream
supplier ??
display cases,
freezer equipment,
display refrigeration units ??
it's all free
to my franchisees.
Logan, I'm not getting
the stores
that are already working?
That was not
our initial intention.
This story just became
really bad all of a sudden.
Yeah, it did.
Logan, I'm not getting
the stores
that are already working?
That was not
our initial intention.
This story just became
really bad all of a sudden.
Yeah, it did.
I don't get it. I mean,
that's a structural
problem with this deal.
Every Shark's not gonna like it.
I can tell you right now.
We've seen this structure
before. We don't like it.
We want to wet our beak
in <i>all</i> the ice cream.
Such bad people.
Are you willing to change
the structure of your deal
to continue the dialogue?
I think it's up for discussion,
for sure.
What is the whole business
making pre?taxes?
Net sales ?? lifetime sales,
$6,400,000.
No, not lifetime ??
this calendar year.
$3,400,000.
Wow.
That's all the stores?
Okay.
And what are you gonna make
on that after everybody's
paid and everything?
It should be roughly
$400,000.
$400,000?
Ooh,
that's a real business.
It's a very, very good
business.
Why do you need more money
right now?
'Cause you're already on
a hockey?stick,
you know, projection.
You're already
killing it.
Yeah, so, we can definitely
do this on our own,
but I think with one
or multiple of you guys,
we can save a decade.
Herjavec: Walk me through
a little bit.
When I buy a franchise,
how much help do you give me
with finding a location,
designing the physical space?
99% of all of that.
I have
an architectural team
that can consult with them
if they need to.
I've heard enough.
I'll start.
I'll make you an offer.
Okay.
I'll do the $400,000
for 15%.
Now, Kevin, are you buying
just the franchise?
I'm not interested
in just franchise.
I talked about that
in the beginning.
The <i>whole</i> milkshake.
Yeah,
the whole milkshake.
That's what brings them
to the yard.
That's right.
[ Laughter ]
That's right.
John: Listen, you know, I have
a strategic relationship
Logan:
We went with Mark today
because he shares
the same vision as us.
We wanted
to maintain our stores,
and he's just the right guy.
He knows Texas.
He knows Dallas.
He knows the areas
we really want to go to,
and I really think
he's the right guy.
