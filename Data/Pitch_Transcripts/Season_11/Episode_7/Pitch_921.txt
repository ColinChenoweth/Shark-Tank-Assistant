My name is Lisa Nguyen,
and this is my honey,
Duc Nguyen.
This is our daughter Kaia
and her sweet friend Audrey.
Introducing
Baubles + Soles.
Our patent?pending,
interchangeable shoes
allow your little one
to customize that perfect pair.
Whether it's adorable piggies
for a playdate...
[ Laughter ]
Or pompoms
for that perfect party,
with Baubles + Soles,
one shoe equals
endless possibilities.
Our functional
and fashionable shoes
are machine?washable,
slip?resistant,
totally recyclable,
and, best of all, they're made
right here in America.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to go
from playground to party
with us?!
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.
We have some
stylish samples for you
in which Kaia and Audrey
will help us.
High five.
High five.
High five, high five.
High five, high five.
Yay!
Give this to him.
Good work, Audrey.
Thank you so much.
Herjavec: Oh, so cute!
So, Duc is actually gonna
show you how to use this.
Duc: You put three fingers
inside as a support.
And with the other hand,
you take the bauble,
When Kaia
was 10 months old,
she had this pair of shoes
that somebody had given her,
and it had
a red heart on it.
And I knew I didn't want
to buy more shoes
because she was gonna outgrow
that in two to three months.
And so I thought,
"Gosh, I wish I could just
take out that red heart."
So we went on a journey
to make it happen.
We obsessed, studied.
We found a mold maker
to make the shoes for us,
the tooling.
John: And how many
different items do you have
to attach to the shoe?
Yeah, so, right now,
we have about 20.
What does one package cost
for the base shoes?
Duc: It cost us,
with the packaging, about $11.
We sell them retail
for $49.95...
Wow.
...and wholesale, $25.
How much are they
individually,
to buy a package
of the characters?
So, $12.95 to $16.95,
depending what they are.
So, what is your background,
both of you?
So, I was born
in Montreal, Canada.
[ Speaking French ]
[ Laughter ]
So, I came here
when I was 20 years old
to pursue my film degree.
10 years ago,
I founded my company.
What is
your company?
Wedding video production.
Lisa,
what's your background?
My mother and I left Vietnam
on a fishing boat.
We ended up in a refugee camp
for three years.
Wow.
We were one of
the lucky few, you know?
I mean, 25% of people
who did this died at sea.
So, we actually ??
Herjavec: Lisa, I ??
Sorry. Let ?? Can I ??
Lisa, I really respect
your story.
I think when you come from
those kind of circumstances ??
I mean, you start
from the bottom,
you can only go up.
Um...
Can I just say, we only need
to make 300 pairs per go?
Our hold on inventory
is not ??
Per what?
So, every time
they injection?mold,
300 pairs minimum.
I have to be
transparent with you.
I don't love it.
I think
it's a cute product,
but what really concerns me is,
in a year,
you've really only sold $30,000
through your website.
You've got to grow
that market, and so...
I'm out, 'cause I think
the market's not talking to me
through those sales.
We've done no advertising.
But maybe the market's talking
to one of the other Sharks.
We've done absolutely
no advertising.
But, Lisa,
that's the challenge, right?
Can I add one more thing
before you ??
Sure.
So, one of the things
that we're doing
to grow
our direct?to?consumer ??
and it's something
that we're still
thinking about ??
is the ?? You know
the Build?A?Bear model?
We have the capacity
to allow our customer
to build a shoe
on our website.
You're making my point.
O'Leary: Yeah.
So, what you guys have
is a great product,
but it's not
obviously different.
And so because of that,
you have to find
a way to market it.
And you haven't
found that yet.
And so, because you're not
quite sure how to market it,
you're searching for things
that are accelerants.
You want to add
more sizes
because somebody told you
you need more sizes.
You want to copy
potentially Build?A?Bear
so that when somebody comes,
they have more alternatives
and maybe that'll get them
to buy the shoes.
You haven't figured out
the way to market it yet.
That's what you have to do,
first and foremost.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
I think that just ??
I would like to say
something here.
You know,
most often in "Shark Tank,"
people like you
come and stand on that carpet
and ask for
ridiculous valuations.
Here, we have a situation
where you've actually come in
This is
a demonstrable product.
Last month, our returning?
customer rate was 46%.
So we know that when we get
a customer, they come back.
They come back
for more baubles,
and they come back
for larger sizes.
Greiner: Well, that's
a very good thing for you.
Sitting here today,
you really very much moved me
with your life story.
Often,
the most successful people
have gone through
major hardship.
It gives them
strength and grit
and a bounce?back and a drive
like no other, and ??
Lori, before you say
what you're gonna say,
the direct?to?consumer
market
is an opportunity
for us to grow.
No, I totally get that.
For me, I have to weigh,
"Where do I think
is a right investment?"
at the same time
against my heart.
So, believe me,
my heart with you...
Please.
...was so 100% in,
but I do feel that this is
gonna be a tough journey
because of
the competitive landscape
and because the shoe business
alone is really hard.
But because
we're made domestically,
we do hold on
to very little inventory.
It's ??
And it's not ??
We can turn around that
inventory very, very quickly.
I'm sorry to say
I'm out.
But I will add this.
When this happens,
trust me ??
it's not the end at all.
So, please trust me here.
We're here for you guys.
Can we de?risk this deal
for you?
Could we de?risk it?
Can you what?
Can I de?risk it?
So, for $100,000...
How do you de?risk it?
...how about if we pay you
that back in two years
from the revenue that we make
from the profits that we make?
I know this company's
going to work,
and I know
that I'm here for a Shark.
This has been
our biggest dream,
and we're here.
but Lisa is not
giving up easily
in trying to get a deal
for her interchangeable
kids shoe company,
Baubles + Soles.
Could we de?risk it?
Can you what?
Can I de?risk it?
So, for $100,000...
How do you de?risk it?
...how about if we pay you
that back in two years
from the revenue that we make
from the profits that we make?
I know this company's
going to work,
and I know
that I'm here for a Shark.
This has been
our biggest dream,
and we're here.
It's just, the business
isn't at the point
where I feel I can invest in it
to get that level of return.
But I think
you'll figure it out.
I see you're
very emotional about it.
We're here for you.
No.
We're here for you.
Greiner:
But let me explain ??
Listen, you're not gonna fail.
You're not gonna fail.
I'll give you $100,000
for 25%.
Wow.
This product
is gonna be huge.
Let's see how Radiate
is doing now.
to introduce our product
to a whole new audience.
Why can I not
think of an invention?
Robert was able to introduce us
to major retailers
and even got us in
with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Now we're in more than
1,000 brick?and?mortar
retailers worldwide.
Davidson:
All this growth has led
to a huge partnership
and I love the product.
Soon as I saw it, I said,
"This is fun, this is cool,
and we're gonna sell
a lot of them."
Fun and cool, just like me.
Everybody say "Radiate"!
All: Radiate!
When we pitched
the Sharks,
we had only had $16,000
worth of sales.
It's now been 18 months,
and we've sold $2.1 million
in retail sales.
You don't have to have
a big education.
All you got to do
is have the desire
and make a great product.
Bryan and Brent
came on our show.
18 months later, they have
a multimillion?dollar company.
If that doesn't inspire you,
then <i>nothing</i> does.
Man,
what a great success story.
Thanks for joining us,
man.
Thank you.
Davidson: This event
has been magical ??
over 12,000 people here,
over 1,000 Radiates sold.
"Shark Tank"
makes dreams come true.
This is proof of it.
but this is
a much different product.
These are things you can take
and wear to work.
What about with
licensed merchandise?
I could see Mavs fans,
you know, with the Mavs logo ??
That's a great idea.
Have you guys done
anything similar?
We have not done licensing yet,
but we're 100% open to it.
I actually think
what Mark just said
is a really good thought.
So, I personally think
Mark would be
a fabulous partner for you.
I think that that could
really help accelerate you.
But I think
he's a better partner for that.
So, I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you, Lori.
We appreciate that.
Okay, guys, I don't
think anybody loves animals
more than I do.
I really love them.
I'm on the board
of the Petco Foundation.
But I don't want to see Blake
in my underwear, you know?
Like, I have to be able
to really relate to it,
and I will <i>never,</i> ever
dress like Blake.
[ Laughter ]
This one's tough for me,
but I'm out.
So, guys,
the challenge is your margins,
particularly if
you're gonna try to resale.
So if I brought it into the Mavs
to sell a matching set,
the margins
just aren't there.
Right.
So, how do we
solve that?
So, we're actually looking at
other manufacturers.
We know that our margins
are rather slim right now
because we have to produce
such little at a time
due to lack of funds.
Would you do T?shirts,
though?
Absolutely
we can do T?shirts.
Of course.
Absolutely.
I smell an offer
coming from Mark.
Let me tell you
where I'm at.
I can't get my head around
dressing up a dog.
I just can't get there.
I'm not saying there isn't
a market or people won't do it.
It's just, I can't do it.
I'm out.
Introducing
The Yard Milkshake Bar.
Wow.
We're what ice cream dreams
are made of.
We have unicorns.
We have mermaids.
We have edible cookie dough,
sprinkles, and more.
We knew people would love
our milkshakes,
but we did not expect people
to line around the building
to wait for one.
Our picture?worthy milkshakes
with a Southern charm
had our new customers
coming back day after day.
So, if I want
to open one up ??
As long as
we buy their product,
they get all of
their equipment for free.
So, how many do you have
in total?
We personally have four
that we own,
and we have one franchise open
and one franchise sold.
Does this deal include
the stores that you own
or just the franchise part
of it?
We're hoping for right now
to just include the franchise.
and interest in rolling out
the Sugar Factory's products
to traditional
grocery stores,
so this would be competitive
to that aspect,
so, unfortunately,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Greiner:
Well, I love it.
I mean,
I really love it.
I think your marketing's
really smart.
I think
the product's fantastic.
So, I'll offer you
the $400,000.
It would be
for the inclusive,
because when I'm in,
I want to really be all?in.
We understand.
And I will do it
for 12.5%.
Thank you for the offer.
Cuban: I'm gonna make you
an offer, too.
Okay.
I'm fine with you guys
owning those four stores.
