My name is Andy Scherer.
I'm asking $200,000
for 15% of the company.
Sharks, peanut butter inspired
me to become an inventor.
It's delicious,
it's nutritious,
and one bite of that sandwich
took me back to my days
as a kid in school.
A lot has changed since then,
but peanut butter
hasn't changed at all.
It's just as hard
to get out of the jar
and just as messy
when you do.
I decided it was high time
to take peanut butter
into the modern age.
So I created
the Peanut Butter Pump.
It makes peanut butter
better.
[ Chuckles ]
Now get ready,
because for the first time
in history on national TV,
we're going to download
a sandwich.
Scherer: Ahh!
Herjavec: Ahh!
Voilà.
One downloaded sandwich.
That's cool.
Now anyone
can make a sandwich
or a healthy snack
quicker, cleaner,
and easier than ever before.
You can easily measure it
for your favorite cookie recipe.
And look how it cleans
the sides of the jar
so you don't have to.
I designed it to get
every last bit of peanut butter
from the jar.
People love this pump.
It's truly a game changer.
Together,
we'll change the world ??
the world of peanut butter.
So, Mr. Andy,
for Peanut Butter Pump,
when are you telling
your Kickstarter contributors
that you will deliver?
Scherer:
Within the coming months.
I've already passed
the initial promise date.
But I've been up front and
transparent about the process.
But you need money
to make them, I'm guessing.
I do. I need money.
So you took in the money
and you already spent it?
I haven't spent
<i>all</i> the money.
However, I have withdrawn
a little bit of money,
and I'm ?? I'm ??
That's not really
what it's for.
But, I mean,
I'll go ahead and do this
even if I have to
sell my house.
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
I mean, I'm going to
make good on it.
That's really the whole point.
You have to.
Ooh! Ooh!
I got a question.
Please, Daymond.
I got a question.
[ Laughing ]
"Please, Daymond."
What problem
is it actually solving?
It's really
the classic last mile,
but for peanut butter.
I mean, you have to
take it out of the jar,
you have to scoop it,
you have to scrape
the sides of the jar.
I mean, some people get ??
Andy, listen, I'm out.
[ Laughing ]
I'm sorry.
Daymond, however,
you know,
30 days,
$100,000 in sales.
In 30 days,
you did $100,000 in sales.
That's correct.
If you use peanut butter
once a month,
you're not
going to need a pump.
Isn't this better used
in a commercial ??
'cause how do the commercial ??
how do hotels,
whatever the case is ??
how do they buy?
They probably buy
in huge tubs, right?
This is for high?volume users,
so families with children...
Kevin.
...with school?age children.
That's probably about
14?, 15 million households.
Juice bars ?? every fitness bar
has a juice bar.
I don't think anybody
really needs a pump
to get their peanut butter
out of a jar.
[ Laughing ] And so ??
I'm sorry ?? I'm out.
Well, I don't think
anybody <i>needs</i> a pump
to get hand lotion out,
either, and yet ??
I think it's different, Andy.
I think this is very ??
I think this is
a very elegant design
that you've come up with
for a problem
that I'm not sure it exists,
so ?? I'm sorry ??
I'm out.
So, Andy, let's disclose
to the community now,
'cause they're watching.
You are not supporting
the 40% of the community
that wants to refrigerate
after opening.
You know they want refrigeration
after opening...
[ Laughing ]
This is so weird.
...because it...
You can't put it
in a fridge.
...creates a viscosity
that you're not supporting.
It creates a ??
Kevin, Kevin,
I am so sick and tir??
Yes or no, true or false?
Disclose now, Andy.
Kevin, I am so sick of
your peanut butter arrogance.
Mark,
this is very important.
Are you ever going to solve
for the viscosity created
by refrigerated peanut?
I have told people not to put it
in the refrigerator.
The real basic problem is,
$200,000 for 15% is crazy.
There's no bigger advocate
for the commodity than I am,
but this price is nuts.
Like, $200,000 for 15%?
The whole business isn't worth
$200,000 right now.
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.
Andy, you're being
a great sport, right?
We're having a little bit
of fun at your expense,
and you're going with it.
Everything's factual, Mark.
Don't insult the community.
Anyways,
from an investment standpoint,
it's just not a fit for me,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Good luck, Andy.
Good luck, Andy.
?Good luck.
?Good luck.
Scherer: This is not the end
of the Peanut Butter Pump.
People love it,
and it will be made.
I think the Sharks are
a little bit out of touch,
and that's all there is to it.
It's a shame
that they didn't go for it,
but somebody will.
