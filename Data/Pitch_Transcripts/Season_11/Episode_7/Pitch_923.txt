Hi, Sharks.
I'm Scott.
And I'm Gina.
We're a husband?and?wife team
from Minneapolis, Minnesota,
and today,
we're seeking $250,000
for 17% equity
in our company.
We've designed
a fresh, fun apparel line
that is,
without a doubt,
the most social?media?worthy
clothing brand
on the market today.
Our designs have been worn
by the most famous influencers
on social media,
but they might not be
the movie stars
Scott: And, Sharks, we have
some samples for you today
that we'll come
and bring to you.
Let me have that sample
right there.
And if you have a pup,
we'll give those for you,
as well.
O'Leary:
He's a model dog.
Here's a coordinating set
for your twins and Lola.
How you feeling
about your outfit?
Herjavec: Thank you.
Thank you.
Gina:
From our recent line.
Here's our
best?selling combo.
Appreciate it.
Thanks.
So, tell us about
how you're selling it
and how it's going.
Yeah, so, today,
about 80% of our business
is direct
through our online store.
Online. Yeah.
Herjavec:
Mark, what do you think?
And about 20%
is through retail.
?[ Laughs ]
?It looks better on the dog.
Robert,
that looks amazing.
[ Chuckles ]
Enjoy Hawaii.
Moving on...
[ Chuckles ]
So, as I was saying,
about 20% is through retail.
For the most part,
our retail sales
are the dog clothes,
which is about
75% of our business.
And most of
our direct sales
have the matching human clothes
ordered with it.
I love dogs, but...why?
[ Laughs ]
Okay, so, honestly,
it started in 2014.
We had a Pomeranian poodle,
and he loved getting dressed up.
But I couldn't
find clothing
Scott: And, uh ??
Yeah, Kevin!
He's built a legacy,
and it's living on
through each dog
that wears his designs.
How did it go from
"This is super cute"
to "Honey,
let's make a business"?
So, I went to school
for design.
I was actually designing
my own women's clothing line
at the time,
which is why Scott said,
"Why don't we just
make them ourselves?"
So, I drafted my first
little pattern for Thomas.
It was
a button?down shirt.
Everywhere we went, people
would come up to us and say,
"Where did you get that?"
But being animal lovers,
we were like,
"There's probably
an opportunity here
for us to make some money
and take some of that
and donate back to animals."
What are your sales?
We've sold almost
a half a million dollars.
Over what period of time?
Since when?
?A half a million dollars?
?What?!
Since November 2014,
we've sold $465,000.
Oh.
However, this was
just a hobby for us
until about
a year and a half ago.
We both
had full?time jobs.
Now it's a nightmare.
And ??
[ Laughter ]
It may be a nightmare for you,
but ask the dog lovers,
and I guarantee that
they're saying this is not.
So, tell us
the last either ??
Well, let's just go
year to date.
Sure. So, year to date, we've
done about $75,000 in sales.
Last year,
we did $196,000 in sales.
Wow.
That's really good.
And this year, we're projecting
to do $240,000 in sales.
So, how much
have you invested?
$500.
That's it?
That's it.
We started small.
We've been focused on profit
since day 1.
We started by making 25,
and we took the profits
from those...
Oh, good for you.
...reinvested.
Why don't more people do that?
That's the only way to do it.
We've been very thoughtful
and deliberate
with how
we've spent the money,
and at this point,
we're saying, "You know what?
We need
a cash infusion."
So, what does it cost? You never
told us what the price of it is.
And what
your cost to goods sold are.
So, our dog shirt,
these classic
button?down shirts ??
a size small costs $10.75
to make.
We retail it for $40.
Whoa.
Our human matching set
right here ??
this is a best?seller ??
we make it for $21.50,
and we sell it for $68.
So, who else
is doing clothing ??
matching clothing
between dog and person?
So, there has been
a brand out there
who's done
matching pajamas,
mostly just
for the holiday season,
Aww!
Gina: He just had to
throw that out there.
And we are somewhat devastated
that we're here
only because
we're missing that.
You're using the baby angle.
Using the baby
to shame me!
Only 'cause
it's his birthday.
?No, no, no, no.
?To shame me!
But it's important
that we're building
for his future.
What's the baby's name?
Ziggy.
Let me throw the offer in.
Do all three of you all
dress the same?
All the time. Look at us.
We're right there.
?Oh, is that ??
?That's Ziggy right there.
?Aww!
?Your baby is so miserable.
Alright,
I'll do it for 25%.
[ Laughing ] Mark!
Thank you so much, Mark.
You've got a deal.
My pleasure.
Awesome.
Congratulations.
Don't you want to know
what the offer was?
Mr. Wonderful,
we still love you.
Of course you do!
Thank you for your time.
Happy birthday, Ziggy.
?Congrats.
?Congrats, guys.
Gina: Thank you, Ziggy,
for saving us 5%
with Mark Cuban.
That's going directly
into your college fund
or whatever business
you want to start.

of artisan peanut butter.
We don't care, Kevin.
Did you get
kicked out of the community?
Kevin, we don't care.
