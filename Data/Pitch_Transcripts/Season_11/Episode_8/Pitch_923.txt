My name is Aaron Hirschhorn
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
Hirschhorn: Now,
bear with me for a second.
If you were to fast forward
just 10 short years,
four out of five
of these little guys
are gonna suffer from
devastating age?related illness,
Hirschhorn: Our story begins
two years ago
when I was finally freed
from a decade
of chronic back pain
with stem?cell therapy.
Aaron, let's just
walk through
some of the common sense
elements of this.
Please.
I'm in sports, right?
of Aaron's stem?cell?banking
company for pets, Gallant.
For every sale you have,
you're losing money.
Yeah.
You know,
you're gonna sink
because you're not gonna have
the cash flow to support that.
So ??
Well, we ?? We're
well?capitalized now.
I have very good investors ??
a great investor network.
You're not.
But you're not.
You're not.
You can't sell anything.
I mean, I think there's
a couple things that concern me.
All right, Aaron,
because I'm so creative
Aaron, I'll simplify things.
Look, I believe
in stem cells, right?
I believe in
what you're trying to do
in terms of the storage.
I just don't think
you've got it figured out,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
All right, thank you, Mark.
Good luck.
Thank you.
So, I think there's a lot
of potential in this business.
Thank you.
I think with Lori,
we could actually
really do a lot
to get this out
direct?to?consumer initially.
I believe
in the long?term potential.
But we're looking
at coming in together
at $500,000 for 8%.
Whoa.
I really believe in this.
Hirschhorn: Thank you.
I know quite a bit
about it,
So, what are you gonna do,
Aaron?
You've got to make
a decision.
I know. Lori, Anne,
would you guys do 4%?
[ Chuckles ] Oh.
So I'll give you 4%
of the business
'cause I see the value
that you bring.
