My name is Aaron Hirschhorn
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
and my company is Gallant.
Take a look
at these little puppies!
Aren't they so cute?
So, I brought one
for each Shark.
Yay!
Okay.
Daymond, that's Bear.
Hey, Bear.
How you doing?
?[ Laughs ]
?That's Bunny.
Baby. Aww, hi.
All right.
Hi.
O'Leary: See, if this ??
if this guy pees on me,
it's over between us.
I understand.
Hirschhorn: Now,
bear with me for a second.
If you were to fast forward
just 10 short years,
four out of five
of these little guys
are gonna suffer from
devastating age?related illness,
Hirschhorn: Our story begins
two years ago
when I was finally freed
from a decade
of chronic back pain
with stem?cell therapy.
And at the same time, I watched
our beloved family dog, Rocky,
suffer from arthritis
so painful,
she couldn't even walk.
And I wondered if
the same revolutionary science
that helped my back
could also be used for pets.
Turns out, it can.
So, I created Gallant ??
stem?cell banking and
regenerative medicine for pets.
Just as you can bank
your children's
umbilical cord stem cells
at birth,
you can now save your pet's
young, healthy stem cells
during a routine spay
or neuter.
All you do is sign up
on our website,
and we send our kit
to your veterinarian
and take care of the rest.
And I'm so excited
about Gallant,
not only because stem cells
treat multiple disorders,
from kidney disease
to broken bones.
In research animals,
they've been shown
to extend healthy life
by as much as 30%.
Imagine that ?? that's years
more with your best friend.
So, Sharks, for $500,000
in exchange
for 2% of the company...
?Oh!
?Wow.
Whoa.
...you can join our pack
of stem?cell scientists
and bring enduring health ??
and puppy love ??
to millions with Gallant.
This is not
gonna end well.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, you must have
fantastic sales, I'm guessing.
So, we have two divisions.
We have
a therapeutics division
that's actively developing
stem?cell medicines,
and we have a consumer
stem?cell banking division
that launches in three weeks.
I know how
this is gonna end.
[ Laughs ]
Tell us your history.
Absolutely.
So, in 2009,
my wife and I each lost
our jobs,
and we started dog sitting
in our house
to make extra money.
[ Chuckles ]
Aaron, let's just
walk through
some of the common sense
elements of this.
Please.
I'm in sports, right?
And so if it was just as simple
as stem cell injections,
you just give a shot,
everything would grow back,
injuries would never matter,
correct?
Well, sounds like a great dream
to me, yeah.
I mean, but my point is,
if it worked,
anybody with a decent doctor
would be doing it.
Why do you think
that's not happening?
John: Well, Mark ??
But I think the reality here
is also this is about the dogs.
I absolutely believe
there is a huge pet market.
You know, people love trying
to take care of their dogs.
As much as you're right,
this is not standard of care
for humans,
but there's a whole world
that comes
where you can actually do
research first on animals.
I'd like to spend a little time
on the reason you're here.
?Yes.
?Your business.
Regardless
on the skepticism,
let's start
with the consumer side.
Wonderful.
How much does it cost me
to get the kit?
Our goal is
to make this accessible.
So, we charge only $95 a year
to store your stem cells.
So, every year, I pay you $95,
you hit my card every year.
?Correct.
?I get the kit for free.
The kit, we send
to your veterinarian.
So, you don't even have
to worry about it.
The consumer buys it
on our website.
And does the vet
make money?
That's one channel.
And the vet,
it's a revenue stream for them.
How much
are they making?
They make about $100 ??
a "collection fee."
You instantly lose money
on the initial acquisition...
Correct.
...because you're paying
the vet.
Correct.
How much does it cost you
to do the extraction?
So, it costs us ??
Including the cost of the kit,
shipping, everything,
it's about $275 right now.
Including
what you pay the vet?
Uh, no,
plus if we pay the vet.
So it's $375
right out the door?
Most vets
don't even want that.
They just want to kind of do it
for free, or...
And what is it costing you
to operate the business,
your burn rate?
So, we're burning about
$400,000 a month right now,
most of that on R&amp;D.
Are there
any other investors?
So, we have raised a total
of $10 million
to fund this business.
$10 million. Okay.
From who?
I've hired some
of the top ??
What was the last valuation
on the round?
$25 million,
the same as my ask.
How much money do you anticipate
having to raise
at the time you're gonna
launch your product?
'Cause you don't have
any marketing money
available to you yet.
Yeah, so, we will have
to raise money again.
How much?
We'll raise money again
in 2021,
probably $25 million.
Your acquisition costs,
that's what makes me
the most anxious here
about what you're doing
is that for every sale you have,
you're losing money.
Yeah.
You know,
you're gonna sink.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
but Anne is concerned
about the business model
of Aaron's stem?cell?banking
company for pets, Gallant.
For every sale you have,
you're losing money.
Yeah.
You know,
you're gonna sink
because you're not gonna have
the cash flow to support that.
So ??
Well, we ?? We're
well?capitalized now.
I have very good investors ??
a great investor network.
You're not.
But you're not.
You're not.
You can't sell anything.
I mean, I think there's
a couple things that concern me.
I mean, one thing 23andMe does,
we make money on every kit.
But it makes me
really nervous
that you're gonna
lose money
on every single kit
going out the door,
and it's gonna be
a couple years to recapture.
John: Well, listen here ??
It takes a little while.
Let me tell you
something.
If Anne's nervous,
I'm out.
[ Laughter ]
Daymond, you know
what it's like to love a pet.
I mean, how can you
not support it?
Listen, I'm on the Petco board,
the foundation board.
You'd be such a great partner
for this.
But if Anne's nervous,
I'm out.
Thank you.
I like a lot of aspects
of this business.
This is
an emerging science.
Yeah.
The research is gonna take
years to do,
but the consumer business,
which is gonna be
your foundation for research
and for therapeutics
and all this coming
is a money?loser.
It's a money sink.
And so unless I ??
like ??
Perhaps
in the very short term, yeah,
but, I mean, when we're creating
this brand?new market ??
I would say for me,
give me some kind of hope
about how does
that $275 go down.
?Raise prices.
?Raise prices to $399,
which actually is
not potentially a bad idea.
Cuban: Exactly.
Like, raise prices here.
Your volume is definitely
gonna go down,
but at least
you're not hemorrhaging
on the consumer side.
Yeah, our perspective is that,
because it's
a brand?new market
that nobody knows
anything about,
we're doing everything
we can
to lower those barriers to entry
in the beginning...
Right.
...to create word of mouth,
to create virality,
to get the vet on.
When 23andMe launched,
we launched at $1,000,
and in some ways, there was
a benefit of doing that
because you get
the early adopters...
Yeah. Understood.
...you can work out
some of those kinks,
you always want to treat
those customers then great.
Yeah.
But then take down
the price.
Perhaps you're right
that at scale,
there's a better
pricing structure.
Yeah.
All right, Aaron,
because I'm so creative
and I've been
listening to you ??
Cuban: Oh, Lord.
And my juices
are flowing.
I love the space.
I'm in the space.
I know.
And I am Mr. Wonderful.
Here's two offers.
You choose
between them.
I'll give you
the $500,000,
I want the 2%, plus
I want another 2% in options.
So, then I'm basically
getting in at $12.5 million
because of the value
I bring.
and $10 off every kit
in perpetuity.
That gets me so incentivized
to sell these kits for you,
you have no idea.
Think about that while everybody
else natters in the background.
That is very creative.
Of course it is.
I really think that's
a clever way of doing it.
Of course it is.
And you'd be
a great partner.
Of course I'd be a great
partner. I love it.
Aaron, I'll simplify things.
Look, I believe
in stem cells, right?
I believe in
what you're trying to do
in terms of the storage.
I just don't think
you've got it figured out,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
All right, thank you, Mark.
Good luck.
Thank you.
So, I think there's a lot
of potential in this business.
Thank you.
I think with Lori,
we could actually
really do a lot
to get this out
direct?to?consumer initially.
I believe
in the long?term potential.
But we're looking
at coming in together
at $500,000 for 8%.
Whoa.
I really believe in this.
Hirschhorn: Thank you.
I know quite a bit
about it,
and I just think that,
you know, down the road,
a lot of things
will be figured out,
but you're
in the beginning.
I think Anne is
a great partner,
so I'm really excited
to work with her.
I think ??
8%.
I'd love to figure out a way
to make this work.
Look, I've got employees
that I've given a lot of equity,
I've got top scientists who
basically took a chance on me.
I got to protect them, too.
But what I think
is important, too, is,
is them knowing the benefit
of having us on your team.
Yes.
Because we can give you
so much help.
So, what are you gonna do,
Aaron?
You've got to make
a decision.
I know. Lori, Anne,
would you guys do 4%?
[ Chuckles ] Oh.
So I'll give you 4%
of the business
'cause I see the value
that you bring.
And we're off to the races.
Hirschhorn: I did not expect
Anne and Lori to team up.
Totally surprising, but
they're honestly the dream team,
because Anne is
a perfect partner, Lori, like ??
Nobody knows better
how to explain things
to consumers and the world.
This is ?? I mean, you can see,
even Fred's happy.
