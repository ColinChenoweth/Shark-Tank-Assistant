It's a risk
I'm willing to take.
?[ Laughs ]
?Hi, little baby.
That's Panda.
Cuban: And who do I get?
You have Fred.
What up, Fred?
?Hi.
?Whatcha doing, Freddy?
Hi! Aww, so sweet.
like arthritis, blindness,
or worse.
[ <i>Thunder rumbles</i> ]
Greiner: Ohhh.
?[ Laughs ]
?Who's there?
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Cuban: Move along.
Move along.
You ain't touching Fred.
[ Laughter ]
Mine doesn't want
to go.
I'm sorry, buddy, I tried
to buy you out, but no deal.
Panda wanted a royalty.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: The Grim Reaper.
I'm turning into Robert.
[ Laughter ]
And that turned into an online
platform for dog sitting.
Think Airbnb for dogs.
?Mm?hmm.
And we generated
over $100 million in sales
in under six years.
What?
What? $100 million?
Wow.
We merged with a competitor
two years ago,
and that's now
worth $925 million.
What was the name
of the company?
John: Wow.
My company was called
DogVacay,
and now it's called Rover.
Wow.
But what was
your background training?
In college,
I was a neuroscience major.
I was a high?school
science teacher as my first job,
but this is, like,
next?level science.
I mean, what I've done here
is I've hired the top minds
in the field of veterinary
regenerative medicine
to make this a reality.
So, we have four key patents
that essentially
lock competitors out of this...
You do?
...multi?billion?dollar
market.
What does it cover,
technically?
Yeah, so, if I may
just back up
and explain a little bit
about how stem cells work.
Yeah.
So, just the same way
a lizard,
like, regrows its tail,
we have stem cells
in every tissue of our body,
and they're responsible
for regenerating.
Now, the problem is,
as you get older,
your store of stem cells
go down dramatically.
Wow.
And that's directly related
to aging.
So, the idea is you should save
these young, healthy stem cells
so that, potentially
in later years,
you can use it as a therapy
to avoid expensive surgeries,
or really to even avoid
the onset of disease.
So, what we've done
is patented the way
to isolate the stem cells
from the reproductive tissue
that they throw in the trash
when you get a spay and neuter.
Screw the dogs.
I'm gonna do this myself.
You can do stem cells ??
I would recommend you do it.
It changed my life.
Completely changed my life.
You'd have
to be neutered first.
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary:
I don't like that part.
So, corned beef, pastrami,
this is in my bloodline.
So, how are the sales now
in the delis?
So, we're brand?new,
we're just a few months in,
and in this time,
we've pulled off
$10,000 from the local delis,
and we just launched ??
just a week ago ??
our e?commerce,
cold?chain store,
and we sold $2,000
in the first 24 hours it was up.
We didn't even put
any advertising into it.
What do you sell it for,
and what's your cost?
I pay $3.80 per pound
to have it made,
and I sell it for an average
between $8 to $10 a pound.
Now, Jennifer, I have to ask you
this question, okay?
Please.
There are two very large,
well?capitalized,
public companies
doing plant?based meats.
What stops them from doing
this derivative of meat
and crushing you like the
corned beef cockroach you are?
Because I'm gonna start working
with one of you,
and we're gonna bring this
to market.
Good answer!
Good answer.
John: Jennifer,
why so much, the value?
I mean, you're asking
for $1 million valuation,
but at such an early stage.
Agreed.
'Cause I'll be honest,
I invested in one
of those companies
that's on the market...
Yeah.
...and I made three times
the amount
of money you're asking for
in a matter of three weeks.
That's good.
And I didn't have to make
any calls,
I didn't have
to do anything.
Okay.
So, why this valuation
of $1 million?
Fair enough.
Because there are teams
of plant?based investors
out there,
and they've already come
knocking on my door,
and they're ready to give me
half a million
for 10% of my business.
So, why are you here?
Why would you offer it to us
for $100,000?
I'll tell you why.
I've been waiting. Why?
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Because one Shark dollar
is worth five regular dollars.
?Yes, that's right!
?You're so right.
So, why so much,
the valuation?
That's the point, right?
Aren't you saying
that we bring value
to this?
Yes.
But I bring value, too.
She's giving it to you
at a fraction
of what she's already been
offered.
I bring value, too.
My projections ??
$3 million next year.
Well, you haven't lost
your New York hustle.
?I know, right?
?No, no, you're right.
Listen, my projection
for next year
is that I'm gonna look like
the guy who plays Thor.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.
Fair enough, fair enough.
It's not gonna happen,
most likely.
Okay.
Jennifer, do you have
any flexibility
in your equity?
Because I find it
a little light.
I don't think
you're worth half a mil.
Yeah, it is light.
I came here to negotiate.
?Okay.
?I can't give away a huge piece.
Yeah.
I'm gonna throw you an offer.
I'm gonna throw you an offer.
Let's start this going.
Let's talk, Kevin.
And I will help you.
As Chef Wonderful, I'm amazing.
Wow.
I'll help sell it.
Okay.
And he's selling beef.
So, I'm thinking
I'll give you the $100,000
and I want 20%.
Thank you for that offer.
Wojcicki:
So, I love this space.
I'm an investor
in other plant?based foods.
It's a super?hot space right now
in Silicon Valley.
There's a lot of money
going into this.
So, I'd love if you can help me
get a little bit
more comfortable with,
you know,
why is it with all
the Silicon Valley
money that's coming
and some of those
big companies out there,
it's hard for me to understand
how you can stay protected.
You mean
the cockroach factor.
How is this actually
gonna be ??
Cuban:
So, I'll simplify everything.
How do you deal with
the cockroach factor?
Jennifer,
I'll simplify everything.
Go ahead.
I love it.
Yeah.
I went vegetarian.
Yeah!
I'll make you an offer
that ??
You know my style, right?
I like the whole "yes or no,
let's negotiate right now."
Oh, it's crap.
It's crap.
I'll give you $250,000...
$250,000?
...for 20%.
Okay.
But this is right now,
do or die?
Do or die,
tell me what you want to do.
So, more than
what you were asking ??
More than what
you were asking for.
Tell me what you want to do.
I'll be on the front page of it,
I'll be the poster child
for it,
we'll hustle.
Mark Cuban,
you got yourself a deal.
?That's what's up!
?Whoo!
Very, very smart.
I don't hustle,
I don't mess around either.
Oh, sir.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Love the company.
Thank you so much.
Wow.
Congrats, Jennifer.
Thank you, guys!
Thank you!
Now that I have a deal
with Mark,
the future of Unreal Deli
is extraordinary.
We thought we were doing
great things before.
Just wait and see
what's gonna come.
This business is a cash cow.
We're making cash,
and we're saving the cows.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is an innovation
in the fitness field.
We started selling the product
in 2017.
Since that time, we got a
lifetime sales of $2.1 million.
?Wow. That's great.
?Thank you.
What did you raise
on Kickstarter?
We raised $95,000.
And where are you selling
predominantly?
We sell into
the commercial markets.
So, we're doing pretty well
with gyms.
So, we're 38% commercial and
we're 38% direct?to?consumer,
and the rest makes up
our international
and domestic distribution.
So, what does it cost to sell,
and what does it cost
to make?
So, we've been trying
to figure out the price point.
So, we're actually moving
our price point to $199.
And where has it been?
At $279.
Okay.
$199's better.
Much better.
As soon as we drop
below that $200,
the needle just goes ??
swht! ?? like that.
What does it cost?
And what does it cost
to make one landed?
It landed is $73.
Ooh.
And that's the other reason
why we're here.
?That's a little risky.
?It is, it is.
Are you making
in China?
Yes, we're making it in China,
and that includes the tariffs.
And how low
could the cost of goods go?
We believe we can get it
to around $40 to $45.
O'Leary: And are you going
to make any money
in this calendar year?
We're gonna do $850,000
this year.
And will you make
any money?
We will break even this year,
we'll turn a profit next year.
We're projecting $1.4 million
next year.
We'll make $200,000 on that.
So, with cash flow,
we have enough
to where we can go get
inventory, but not enough.
That's why we're struggling
to grow a little bit
because we don't have
the inventory.
Is this patented?
It is.
We have a design patent issued,
we have
a utility patent pending.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
And I like it, so...
Thank you.
$300,000 for 40%.
?Ha!
?You savage.
I appreciate the offer,
Daymond.
Kevin's rubbing off on you,
Daymond.
What are you
talking about?
I'm trying to stretch him,
you know?
I try to teach the grasshopper,
but he's so greedy.
You can always counter,
but remember,
a lot of times, entrepreneurs
come up here and say,
"Will you give us more capital
if needed?"
I usually go, "No."
Okay.
I know in this instance
that I will have to do that.
O'Leary:
I'll make you an offer.
Um...
Do you do Instagram ads,
do you do Facebook ads?
Do you want to hear the offer,
or you want to hear more noise?
Like, what is your
direct?to?consumer selling?
I would like to hear both.
Yeah, so...
[ Laughs ]
I would like to hear both.
O'Leary: She's talking
about Instagram,
and I'm about to make you
an offer.
Do you mind if Kevin wants
to give me an offer
and then I can answer
your question?
Yeah.
I like sales.
I like cash flow.
Oh, no.
I like sales. I like sales.
I like it, too.
We have that in common.
The product has merit,
no question.
Thank you.
So, I'll do the $300,000
for 15%,
'cause I'm not greedy
like Daymond.
But I want $20 a unit
in royalty.
But not forever.
Okay.
[ Laughs ]
The royalty goes away
when I hit a million bucks.
I get three times and
a little bit more on my money.
?[ Laughs ]
?Whoa.
Cuban: Kevin,
you greedy savage.
Please, the name
is Mr. Wonderful.
[ Laughs ]
Hi, Sharks,
my name's Jiake Liu.
And I'm Terry Lin.
We're the co?founders
of Outer.
We're seeking $750,000
in exchange for 4% equity stake
in our company.
?Come on, man.
?Ooh.
Imagine for a moment,
it's early in the morning,
the house is still quiet.
Your coffee
just finished brewing.
It's a perfect spring day.
The birds are chirping.
You look outside
at your outdoor sofa.
Coffee in hand,
you inhale deeply...
Ohh!
The cushions are wet,
and now so are my pants!
We call that
the soggy bottom syndrome.
Sharks, that's just one
of many problems
with outdoor furniture.
It falls apart easily,
it's very uncomfortable,
or they're stored
in the garage somewhere,
never to be used.
At Outer, we've solved
all of those problems.
We've created
the perfect outdoor sofa
that's as comfortable
as your bed
and as durable
as your camping equipment,
all while using
eco?friendly materials.
Most importantly,
no more soggy bottoms
with our patent?pending
invention,
the Outer Shell Cover.
Let me show you
how it works.
In the evening, all you have
to do is cover up,
and then pull
the Outer Shell over,
and the cushion
is completely protected
from the elements.
If you know there's
a rain storm coming,
all you have to do is take it
and go with you.
Greiner: Wow.
So, it's very easy to carry
and store.
John: Very cool.
And the next morning,
there's gonna be a layer
of morning dew on here,
but all you have to do
is open it up,
flip it open.
The perfect sofa
ready for you to enjoy.
So, we've created
the perfect outdoor sofa,
but we realized
that the shopping experience
wasn't great.
Typically, when you see
an outdoor sofa,
you see it inside,
in a climate?controlled
environment
where it never has
seen sun, rain, or bird poop.
So, we've actually
revolutionized
the shopping experience.
We've developed
a proprietary,
peer?to?peer showroom
platform.
It's where we convert
our customer's showrooms
into our showrooms,
and in doing so,
customers can see, touch,
and feel the sofa
before they decide to buy.
It's something that we call
a Neighborhood Showroom.
It's a sharing economy
for retail.
Liu: So, Sharks,
who is ready to join us
to bring life outside?
O'Leary:
How much does the sofa cost?
So, the sofa you're looking at
right now,
the three?seater
is $2,500.
?$2,500?
?Okay.
Greiner:
I don't think that's bad.
What does it cost you
landed?
So, each chair is $800.
They're modular,
by the way.
Each retail cost is $825
when you average it out.
And then the cost of goods made
is about $225 or so.
?$225.
?$225.
?Yep, landed.
So, I want to make sure
I understand this,
is instead of having
a showroom
where you have your own
retail space, so to speak,
your customers
are opening up their backyards?
Exactly. Yeah, you got it.
Do I understand that right?
You got that perfectly,
yeah.
So, what do I get paid
for allowing that to happen?
Yeah, so, we're testing that
right now,
and, uh, you're expected to make
about $20 to $50 per visit.
And the platform that we built,
you have to book a visit.
You can't just show up to
somebody's home randomly, right?
I get it.
So, $750,000, 4% computes
$18.7 million.
?Good math.
?Yeah.
Why is this worth
$18?plus million?
So, Kevin, so,
the outdoor furniture
market in the U. S.
is a $9 billion market.
Oh, that's the worst answer!
No, don't go by that.
Don't go by that.
Do you watch the show?
That's a very bad thing
to say.
Kevin, how big is the bankruptcy
market in the U. S.?
It's really, really big.
But go ahead, Jiake.
Uh, we just launched
about four months ago,
and we did about $800,000
in sales to date.
But you haven't made
any money yet, have you?
We're not
making money yet.
Why $18 million?
What's the reason?
Yeah, um, so, we ??
First of all, we just closed
our last round
with our
VC?backed investment.
At what valuation?
That was
a $13.5 million valuation.
So you came into the Shark Tank
and raised it even more?
How much do you project
this year?
This year, we're gonna close out
at least $1 million.
Next year,
we're projecting $5 million.
Greiner: So,
how many partners do you have,
and what percentage
of the company do you two own?
I own 60%,
Terry owns 25%,
and my family factory
owns 15%.
So, another answer
to the valuation
is because it's actually
taking out
the risk
on the supply chain.
So, they're essentially
giving us this at cost, right?
Your family is subsidizing you
by not taking a margin
because they own 15%
of the business?
That's right.
Interesting.
And we don't have to pay for
the inventory until we sell it.
That's interesting.
So, guys, uh...
You know the valuation's crazy.
You know, you're gonna...
You only sold $800,000,
hopefully $1.5 million,
and you're valuating
at over $18 million.
You know exactly what's gonna
happen to you here, right?
So I'm out.
Wojcicki: So, for me,
coming from Silicon Valley,
I'm used to seeing massive
valuations all the time,
and, frankly, I've way overpaid
for a number of deals
that I think can potentially
change the world
or actually have
a huge impact.
I don't think
it's world?changing for me,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Hey, guys, I think
it's a great business.
Could it be
a $100 million business?
Yeah, it really could be.
But look at it from my end,
right?
Let's just say you do
$200 million.
?Sure.
?And your margins are 10%.
Net margins,
you'd be thrilled to death.
You're making $20 million,
I'm making 5% of that.
I mean, that's not bad money,
but the risk?reward versus what
you're asking just is not there.
But current DTC brands
have a multiple
of anywhere
from three to ??
Yeah, that's great,
and you found the VCs
that pay those kind
of multiples, right?
Mm?hmm.
That ain't me.
That's not "Shark Tank."
For those reasons, I'm out.
I like it.
I really do.
But I don't mean any disrespect
to the previous VCs.
They are not Mr. Wonderful.
I am.
You may not like this offer,
but I'm going to make it
anyways.
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out,
but Kevin seems interested
in Terry and Jiake's outdoor
furniture company, Outer.
You may not like this offer,
but I'm going to make it
anyways.
Now, traditionally,
to get back my capital,
I would want some kind of
cash flow
in the form of, you know,
maybe I'd make a debt,
or maybe I'd make a royalty.
But I'm in a generous mood
today. I'm feeling frisky.
Oh, my Lord.
[ Chuckles ]
So, I'm gonna give you $750,000,
straight equity.
I want 20%.
[ Laughs ]
I don't care
if he laughs.
He didn't give you
any money.
Um...
I would love to hear Lori.
I love it.
I want to be part of it.
But you've just
started selling it.
How about this?
Let me throw a different type
of offer at you.
So, give you a $750,000 loan
as a line of credit,
but I want $20
in royalty per chair.
The royalty
until I get paid back
the $750,000
into $1 million.
Hmm.
And then at the end
of the day,
I'll have 10% of the company.
Yeah.
You know, grasshopper,
you've learned
from the master.
[ Laughter ]
Lin: That sounded like
your kind of deal, I know.
There's only one Mr. Wonderful,
and he is amazing.
I could easily do that deal
and even beat it,
'cause that's my kind of deal.
She ?? Basically, Lori
learned that from the master.
Would you match
that deal?
Or how would you beat
that deal?
Ooh, if you want him
to match my deal
and you would pick him,
then I'm gonna go out.
Wouldn't do that.
I'll do it.
No.
?Ooh.
?I'll do the deal.
I'll do her deal.
Seriously,
you're gonna lose me,
and that
you will regret forever.
?Can we talk?
?I'll do her deal.
?Can we talk about this?
?Forever.
Mm.
Let's talk about it.
He's gonna match my deal.
No, wait, wait, let me squeeze
her head a little bit.
You should not even
have to think about that.
Let me do you a favor.
I feel like five, four,
three, two...
No, no, no,
I'll do them a favor.
...say yes now.
I'll do her deal.
My deal could evaporate.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, don't.
Mnh?mnh. Mnh?mnh.
I'll do her structure
for 5% equity.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, baby!
?[ Laughs ]
?That's ridiculous.
Just to shake it up.
Make a decision.
Make a decision, guys.
Kevin's willing to do 5%,
$750,000.
I think
that's really attractive.
But we do want to work with you.
I feel that connection.
So, is there any way
you can match that?
We'll even throw in
the $1 million.
So, it's $1 million paid back
to the royalty, but 5%.
You want to raise
the royalty?
Uh, the royalty ??
You want to kick up
the royalty
and I'll go down
on the percentage?
You can afford it, especially
with how many we'll sell.
Uh, what's your offer
on the royalty?
Well, why don't we go
to $30?
$30 works?
I think $30 works.
$30 works, 5%?
$30 up until $1 million?
So, $750,000 as a loan.
Okay.
I get $30 a chair
until $1 million
is paid off.
Okay.
We'll make it 3% interest
and 5% equity.
Let's do it, Lori.
Let's do it.
Yoo!
Whoo!
That's good.
This is so brilliant
in the outdoor space.
Wait till you see
the other things that
we're coming up with.
Honestly, it's brilliant.
We're working on
so many more products.
Cuban:
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you.
Greiner: Why would you ever buy
anything else?
Congratulations.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.
?Congrats, guys.
?Congratulations. Congrats.
Wow.
[ Laughs ]
Nice job.
We're not trying to get
the best deal,
we're trying to find
the right partnership.
Kevin actually made
a better offer than Lori,
at the end of the day,
but, you know,
Lori definitely won us over
because of that connection
that we felt with her.
