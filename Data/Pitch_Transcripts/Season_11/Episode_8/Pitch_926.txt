My name is Mrs. Jenny Goldfarb,
and I'm from the mean streets
of New York City.
I'm a fast?talking,
no?nonsense city girl,
and I'm here seeking $100,000
for 10% on my business,
Unreal Deli.
Capiche?
Capiche. [ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
[ Normal voice ] Now, although
I hail from New York City,
about a decade ago, I moved
to beautiful, sunny Los Angeles.
There, I shed the pesky accent.
What I didn't shed ??
my deep love
for the authentic delis
New York is famous for.
I wanted corned beef,
I wanted pastrami,
I wanted it stacked thick on rye
with Russian and mustard
and all the fixin's.
[ Chuckles ]
So, you can imagine my dismay
when I became vegan
and realized I couldn't eat
my beloved corned beef
or pastrami at all.
That's why I created
Mrs. Goldfarb's Unreal Deli,
home of the most mouthwatering,
decadent vegan corned beef.
That's right, Sharks,
at Mrs. Goldfarb's Unreal Deli,
we use nothing
but 100%, super?clean,
plant?based ingredients
that are low in carb,
low in fat,
and protein?packed
to make our Unreal Deli meat.
Don't just take my word for it.
Please dig in
and try for yourselves.
Let's go!
A little closer to you there
is our sweeter rendition
with my signature
Russian dressing
and some apple slaw.
Further back, a little more
of a zinger
with kraut and spicy mustard.
Has a little bit
of a pastrami punch to it.
Not bad.
It's good.
Thank you.
I wanted to create
a healthy rendition...
It's actually really good.
...to the classic deli meat
I grew up on,
which is why I use ingredients
like beets, chickpeas, tomatoes,
and a complex spice blend
to make my deli meat
not only delicious,
but also incredibly nutritious.
Sharks, I'm a fighter,
and I'm gonna keep fighting
until our Unreal Deli meat
is in every grocery store, deli,
and restaurant worldwide.
[ Laughs ]
So, Sharks,
[New York accent]
who wants to sell some meat?
Or do I gotta break some knees
around here?
[ Laughter ]
Jennifer, what's the calorie
count on a sandwich?
[ Normal voice ]
100 per 2 ounces.
?Oh, that's really good.
?That's good.
That's great.
It's really good.
It's super low in fat.
That's not bad.
So, who came up
with the formula for this
and developed it?
I came up with the recipe.
I became vegan
about five years ago.
I ate meat my whole life,
and then I started seeing videos
of animal cruelty,
documentaries,
and it was so heartbreaking,
I couldn't stand to continue
to eat the way I was eating.
And I had
a meat?and?potatoes husband
and some young kids,
and I had to figure out
how to reconfigure
my cooking methods.
So, I bought every
vegan cookbook I could find,
and I figured out how to cook
from the produce aisle
and the grains aisle.
Ultimately, the food
started getting good,
and so I realized
there are a lot
of delicious burgers
on the market
in the plant?based world,
but there was no authentic,
classic deli meat.
So, how long
have you been doing this?
Only a handful of months.
We just incorporated
this year.
Right now, we're at about
a half a dozen
of the largest, most iconic
delis around Los Angeles.
But next month, we're coming
into 58 Whole Foods stores.
You are?
Starting in January,
we're gonna be in two 30?plus
chain restaurants.
What's your history
prior to this?
My history actually goes back
almost 100 years.
My great?grandfather emigrated
from Romania.
There he is in the middle.
I never had the pleasure
of meeting him.
He emigrated from Romania
as a teenager,
not speaking the language,
without his parents.
So did mine ??
one of mine, by the way.
I know.
I was just thinking,
for us to be sitting here
on this stage today,
it's like, what our parents
and grandparents
did for us to get here.
It's incredible.
I know.
He came from Romania,
started working
as a dishwasher
in his first New York City deli,
and then went on to come
and own and operate
several New York City delis
and cafeterias.
