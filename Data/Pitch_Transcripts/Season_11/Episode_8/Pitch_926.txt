Actually, Sharks,
my name's Greg Nigro.
I don't need this hat.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't need
whatever this thing is,
Nigro: Thank you. Yeah.
I prefer that.
Cuban: Come on, DJ, let's have
a push?up contest.
John: I can't.
I blew my shoulder out.
Those are nice.
Thank you.
Greiner:
What'd you think?
Do you like it better
than traditional?
Yeah, because you're balancing
your body,
so I felt it also in my neck,
you know,
at the same time,
because of the stability.
Greg, you got a beautiful offer
on the table.
?Greg, that's a fad.
?And just the other day ??
No, it's not a fad.
It is a fad.
It's still in stores.
How many people
do you have ??
Lori, that's not the proof.
Let me finish.
It's still in stores everywhere.
