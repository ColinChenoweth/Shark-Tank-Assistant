Actually, Sharks,
my name's Greg Nigro.
I don't need this hat.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't need
whatever this thing is,
and I certainly don't need
this crystal ball
for you guys to see
that fitness trends
are shifting rapidly.
People want interactive apps,
live streaming content,
versatile, easy?to?use equipment
that provide fast results
and a fun experience.
Now, our product checks
all those boxes.
With hundreds of exercises
and only three square feet,
the future of fitness is...
The Terra?Core!
The Terra?Core makes
working out fun
and effective
for all fitness levels.
It's 28 pounds and 46 inches
with a patented,
dynamic air?filled surface
that's comfortable, reactive,
and activates four times
the muscle tissue.
We can lay on it
for bench press,
crunches, and leg lifts.
Judy's doing a bench press.
You can see that her spine
is fully supported
and she's super comfortable.
We can also lift the Terra?Core
with overhead press,
burpees,
and bent?over rows.
Tony's doing a burpee,
which is one of our tribe's
favorite exercises.
We can balance on it.
Judy's doing a bird dog.
She's getting tons of
core activation right now.
We can also stand on it
to do squats and lunges.
Tony's activating more muscle
tissue than a standard squat.
We can also jump on it
for agility training
and sports performance.
And that's not all.
Flip it over, and we have
a whole new playground.
With handles and side bars,
we can do tons of push, pull,
and rotational movements
while our band bridges
keep resistance bands
from slipping, sliding,
and pinching.
The Terra?Core provides
incredible results,
versatility, durability,
and an experience that both gyms
and consumers love.
Sharks, as you can see,
big things ??
and in this case,
big results ??
come in small packages.
Who'd like to come on down
and experience
the future of fitness?
?Oh, I'd love it.
?Yeah, let me get some of that.
?Alright.
?I'm down.
[ Laughs ]
So, the first thing
that I would probably suggest
is on the soft side,
we'll start here,
with maybe doing
some planks.
Yeah.
There you go.
Greiner: Is it harder?
And so one of the things
that people really love
about our product
is the comfort.
Uh, that's what I was just gonna
say, it's comfortable.
?Mm?hmm.
?Yeah, it's very comfortable.
Nigro: Thank you. Yeah.
I prefer that.
Cuban: Come on, DJ, let's have
a push?up contest.
John: I can't.
I blew my shoulder out.
Those are nice.
Thank you.
Greiner:
What'd you think?
Do you like it better
than traditional?
Yeah, because you're balancing
your body,
so I felt it also in my neck,
you know,
at the same time,
because of the stability.
Well, I wonder about people
actually standing
on this at work.
Yeah,
I do it all the time.
You know, everyone
in Silicon Valley
wants a standing desk.
O'Leary: Not so easy.
It's not easy.
So, I get it.
It is very, very cool.
Thank you.
How many exercises
you said exist with this?
[ Exhales sharply ]
I can't pinpoint a number
because I keep seeing new stuff
on Instagram.
What's your background?
So, I've been in
the fitness industry 20 years.
So, I used to be the
vice president of franchising
for Gold's Gym,
and we started this,
we launched it
on a Kickstarter back in 2016.
Greg, you got a beautiful offer
on the table.
And the reason why I ??
Let me explain
why I value that.
Daymond, not to cut you off,
I would love to work with you,
and I appreciate the offer,
but 40% is past
where we can go.
You can always counter.
Okay.
I'd do $300,000 for 20%
if that would be a place ??
You came in for 15%.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Let's ?? There are
other people here
that are interested.
So, can I just understand ??
Like, one thing that always
worries me also
about the fitness industry
is that you get a fad,
and then it's done.
So, what is there ??
I love recurring revenue.
Yes.
Like, is there anything?
Is there an app?
Is there anything else?
Yes.
A subscription coming?
Yes, we have a free workout app
right now.
So, in that app, we have
workouts that we designed,
but we also have a tribe,
we're building a community,
and what's really exciting is a
lot of the people from our tribe
want to put their workouts
in our app,
so we're doing that.
The other thing that
we're looking to do is drive
and create
some premium content.
I'd like to move eventually
into a subscription model.
I'm going from 40%
to 35%
'cause you are just
so convincing.
To go back
to the fad question,
is, you know,
I think fad devices
or fad products
are kind of gimmicky.
Yeah.
I don't really view this
as a gimmick.
You mean like standing
on a little piece of plastic,
a plastic board,
and twisting your hips.
Let's talk about my little
plastic piece of board.
Okay.
The Simply Fit Board.
Did a lot of money.
We did $100 million in sales
in one year.
And now, to date, we are
at $180 million
in retail sales.
Wow.
But how many people are
still using it 30 days later?
?Greg, that's a fad.
?And just the other day ??
No, it's not a fad.
It is a fad.
It's still in stores.
How many people
do you have ??
Lori, that's not the proof.
Let me finish.
It's still in stores everywhere.
And it's still in storage
at everybody's house.
I run into people every day
that tell me
that they use it
every single day.
?Right.
?I don't see it anymore!
It's gone!
No, no, no.
They made their money.
It's gone!
Yeah, right.
Here's the thing,
you run an infomercial,
you can have
tremendous success.
I'll make you an offer.
I'm gonna do $300,000,
22.5%.
22 ?? What are you, trying to
kill me over here?
Okay. Thank you, Lori.
I'm gonna take
my offer down...
Okay.
...to $300,000 for 30%.
Thank you, Daymond,
I appreciate that.
I'm at $300,000
for 22.5%.
Mine's the best offer.
It's 15%.
But ??
But you have a royalty,
Kevin.
So, I'll give you
an offer.
I'll give you the $300,000
for 17%.
Okay.
And I want $10 a board.
?Ooh.
?Savage.
Yeah, the royalty thing's
gonna be really hard for us.
In perpetuity.
?Ooh!
?Forever?
Savage.
O'Leary: Wait a second.
You realize the difference
between my royalty deal
and Anne's,
she's in perpetuity.
You guys do realize
that I have two offers
with no royalties, right?
Exactly.
Yeah, but they're much
higher equity.
Much higher equity.
You have to value the equity.
?I understand that.
Here's the thing.
I like it, I want to do it,
I think I gave you
a really good offer.
You did.
