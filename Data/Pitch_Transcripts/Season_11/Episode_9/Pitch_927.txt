Hi. My name is Forrest Shinners,
and I'm from Stowe, Vermont.
I'm an avid skier
and snowboarder.
These sports are awesome,
but they can also be expensive.
Sure, you can rent the skis
or boards,
but what about the apparel?
A jacket, pants, goggles,
gloves, boots ?? all that.
We call that a kit.
And if you have to buy all
the gear to be fully kitted out,
the cost can really add up.
And what if you only go
once in a while?
Essentially,
it's like burning money.
No!
[ Laughs ]
Don't worry, Mr. Wonderful.
I would never actually burn
<i>real</i> money.
Showbiz.
Wow.
[ Laughter ]
So, let's say you have to buy
an outfit for yourself.
Or your kids.
They outgrow their clothes
every year.
Or what if you have to kit out
your entire family?
It can turn into
a real garbage fire.
Don't try this at home, kids.
?Whoa!
?Ooh!
That's why
I created Kit Lender.
Kit Lender is an online outdoor
gear and apparel rental company.
We make it easier,
less expensive,
and more convenient
for people to get away
and enjoy the outdoors.
Here's how it works.
Kit Lender allows you to rent
everything you need
for outdoor sports,
from jackets and pants
to goggles and gloves,
all for as little
as just $30 a day.
Our 24/7 customer service
is always there for you.
And we ship free to and from
your resort or vacation rental.
We carry
toddler through 3XL sizes
for men and women
and constantly update
our offerings
with the newest styles.
So, no more storing gear
during the off?season,
worrying if everything
is packed,
or agonizing over the cost
and hassle
of schlepping gear everywhere.
Kit Lender's got you covered.
So now you can finally
stop burning money <i>and</i> time,
with Kit Lender.
And with that, I guess it's <i>time</i>
to discuss the money.
I'm seeking $200,000
for 7% equity.
Ooh.
Does anyone have a...
[ Laughter ]
?Whoo!
?Again.
How did you
come up with the idea?
So, I grew up in Stowe, Vermont.
My parents have a ski shop.
They've had it for 45 years.
So, I literally have grown up
in the ski industry.
After college,
moved to New York City,
did the standard
working in finance.
All my friends,
like most New Yorkers,
didn't have the ski clothing
or didn't want to carry it
with them,
so when they'd come up
to my house in Vermont,
I'd say, "Don't worry.
You can just borrow stuff
from our closets."
Well, a couple friends said,
"Wow. This is a great service.
How much do we owe you
for it?"
So, you know, of course,
I had that "Aha" moment.
Looked online ??
there was nobody doing it.
So hustled together
some money,
bought some inventory,
bootstrapped a website.
How long ago
was this?
This would've been
in 2014.
We launched officially
in 2015.
And then first year,
selling out, you know,
we only had
limited inventory.
I was flying up to Stowe,
shipping stuff out,
shipping out of my apartment.
My mom would help me
clean stuff.
So, 2015 was great.
That's when
I pretty much realized
that I had a, um...
a pretty unhealthy relationship
with alcohol,
[ Voice breaking ]
and, um...
So...
So I quit drinking
and focused on this business,
as well as working
a full?time day job,
and that's what I've been doing
for the past four years.
Um...
And then,
just this last spring,
I actually quit my day job
and started working
on Kit Lender full time.
Good for you.
What are your sales?
Last year, we did
about $755,000 in sales.
Wow.
What cash did you make
on the $750,000?
$106,000 in EBITDA.
Forrest,
how does it work?
Can you walk me through?
I love that yellow outfit
on mini Robert.
[ Laughs ]
So, I go to ??
I didn't give you a wig.
Sorry.
[ Laughter ]
Walk me
through the process.
Sure.
So, go online,
our outfits are set up
for kits.
So you'd pick a kit.
It's usually based
on the jacket.
You'd check out.
We'd then hold that order
until you wanted to ski.
So, you'd pick
your first ski day.
How long does it take you
to ship it to me?
It depends on
when you're going.
So, we ask for four days before,
minimum, before your ski trip.
So, you send it to me.
I use it for four days.
Yep.
Do I just put it back
in one of your boxes,
just throw it all
in there?
They come in garment bags,
so, actually, it's easy.
You know,
you'd have Robert's kit
and little Robert's kit,
and, you know,
you'd put them all back
in your garment bags,
tape it back up.
It has
the pre?paid FedEx label.
And it's how much per kit?
So, the kids' kits
are $18 up to $22.
Per day?
Per day.
And adults?
Adults start at about $30,
and they go up to $44.
So if I'm on a three?day
weekend, it's 120 bucks.
I'm fully outfitted,
and I feel like I'm fashionable.
And you look awesome.
I think it's great value.
Yeah.
On the back end,
how do the logistics work?
Are you buying a whole wack
of inventory?
Yeah.
So, we're buying
the inventory.
Our hope is to get
three seasons out of it.
So, how much inventory would you
have right now, dollar value?
So, about $550
in wholesale value.
I'm not a skier.
Okay.
So, this isn't really
up my alley.
Got it.
I do think it is smart.
Thank you.
But I also think it's
an inventory nightmare a bit.
It's just not
really my cup of tea,
so I'm sorry ??
I'm out.
Thank you.
Forrest, you know,
like most companies,
there's a balance between
trying to raise enough money
and not raise too much,
right?
In your particular case, you've
gotten some good traction,
but in order
for this to work,
it's gonna cost you
a lot more.
So, number one, first,
congratulations
on your sobriety.
Thank you.
Four years is
a hell of an accomplishment.
Thank you.
Congrats.
But it's really not a fit for me
right now.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
Corcoran: I've had five kids
that I've taught to ski,
and I can tell you, the worst
part about having family
is outfitting those damn kids
every year with new stuff.
I get cheaper as I go
because it's so expensive.
But to Mark's point,
I think the amount of money
that it's going to take
to do this right,
all the things to make it
a big, forceful business
is gonna cost you
so much money.
But all the while,
I'm thinking to myself
it's mis?marketed.
The rich people
that ski all the time
spend money on ski clothes,
and they spend a lot on it.
It's the kids
that are the problem.
I keep thinking you should
market it toward the children.
Perhaps bad advice,
but that's my own 2 cents on it.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Forrest, your industry is unique
in this respect.
Very few recreational markets
have two players
that know where
80% of the customers are.
These two players have spent
billions of dollars
acquiring pretty well
every mountain
in America and Canada.
They own them all.
They have all the customers.
You have a great idea.
Either you go there
and cut a deal
for customer acquisition
or someone else will
after they see
how good this idea is.
'Cause the incremental rental
is a great idea.
But in this market,
you got to think big,
'cause there's no moat
around this business.
Someone else is gonna think big.
It should be you.
I'm sorry, Forrest.
I'm out.
All right.
It's a brilliant,
brilliant idea.
I mean,
I thought you'd be in.
But there's gonna be two types
of companies in this business ??
the quick and the dead.
Another one of my lines
he stole.
And for you to be
really quick,
you're gonna need
a lot of money,
and more importantly,
you have to get the customer
at the point
they book the ski outing.
So, we'll get ?
we'll work on ??
But you got to have
those affiliate programs.
And, I mean,
the table's set to me.
I mean, that's why
I'm reaching out to you guys.
I mean, I'd love to have you
as a partner.
I also have an Italian
motorcycle that I ride.
[ Laughter ]
We could hang out.
We can go skiing.
? Kumbaya ?
I honestly think
it's a great idea.
Come on, Robert.
You would be
an awesome partner.
I mean, I...
You will not find anybody
that's gonna work harder
on this thing.
I have built it so hard
to this point,
and I think I'm ready
to take it to the next level.
That's why I did quit,
'cause I was like ??
I saw competitors come in.
I knew we had something.
You know,
I don't sleep.
I eat, breathe, I'm gonna be
fulfilling packages.
You're a great guy.
I just ??
It doesn't feel right to me.
I think you got to go
even faster.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.
Congrats, Forrest.
Good luck with everything.
Thank you very much.
Good luck.
Thank you.
