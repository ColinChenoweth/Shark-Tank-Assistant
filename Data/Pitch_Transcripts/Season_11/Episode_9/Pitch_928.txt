My name is
Jason McOmber.
This is Cooper the Elf.
[ Laughs ]
And I know
you all know Santa Claus.
Ho, ho, ho.
[ Laughter ]
I'm the founder and owner
of Beardaments,
and I'm here today
seeking $150,000
in exchange
for 10% of my company.
Now, Sharks, do you recall
the most famous beard?o of all?
There once
was a jolly man
who gave everyone
Christmas cheer.
But Santa,
he grew bored of wearing
the same outfit each year.
I tried ugly sweaters,
but they all just looked weird.
I know!
...shouted the elf.
Let's put stuff
in your beard!
So he clipped in
bright ornaments
of gold, silver,
red, and green.
Now,
this was holiday spirit
that the North Pole
had never seen.
Beardaments!
...exclaimed Santa.
That's what
they'll be called.
You can clip them
almost anywhere.
Even your chest hair,
if you're bald.
[ Laughter ]
But he didn't stop there,
'cause this Santa had no doubt.
There must be other ways
you could deck a beard out.
So the elves quickly made
beard oil, glitter, and lights.
So anyone
without a Rudolph
could still see
through the night.
The North Pole
was ecstatic!
Santa was looking fly.
Even Mrs. Claus couldn't
keep her hands off this guy.
[ Chuckles ]
Now, Sharks,
who wants to season up
your beard
and step
under the mistletoe...
Make my Christmas wish
come true.
Herjavec: Aww!
And let's watch
your money grow.
Ho, ho, ho!
All right, Sharks,
I know you've all stayed off
the naughty list this year,
so Santa and the elf
are gonna pass out
some samples for you.
?Cool beans!
?Wow.
Just when I think
I've seen it all.
?Right?
?Yeah.
Wow, thank you,
Cooper the Elf!
I can't wait to put this on.
How about you, Lori?
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec:
Lori, what do you think?
[ Laughing ] Well, Robert,
that's not your best look.
Ho, ho, ho!
We got you a wig, too.
O'Leary: Oh, that's
Very important. thank you.
There you go, Kev.
Beautiful.
Greiner:
You can clip them anywhere.
Cuban: Thank you,
Mr. Cooper the Elf.
I appreciate that.
O'Leary: Well, I think
it's gonna look terrific.
Ho, ho, ho!
McOmber:
You guys look great.
Well, Santa and the Elf have to
go wrap some presents, guys,
so we're gonna send them
on their way.
?Thank you.
?Thanks, Santa.
?Thanks, Cooper the Elf.
?Bye?bye.
Greiner: Why did you
come up with this?
So, I started this company
four years ago.
Just a Christmas party,
I decided to hook
some stuff in my beard
after probably
a couple drinks.
Everyone loved it
and thought it was funny.
So, that next year,
we started to sell it.
I actually spent
$1,500 of my own money,
ordered some from China.
I got 1,000 packs,
listed them on Etsy and eBay,
a couple of places online,
and I sold out
of those 1,000 packs
within a couple weeks.
So, our first year,
we did $80,000 in sales.
What?!
$80,000?!
In about two months.
Wow. What'd you do
the second year?
Second year was
$155,000 in sales.
?What?!
?Wow.
You got to be kidding.
Herjavec:
What'd you do last year?
$462,000.
What?!
[ Laughs ]
Corcoran: Unbelievable!
And year to date?
We're projecting to do
about $600,000 to $750,000
in sales this year.
And it's all
direct?to?customer?
Yes.
This is a UFB ??
un?frickin'?believable.
Yeah, it blows me away.
So, the regular beard ornaments
sell for $9.99.
I get them made
for $1.66 per pack.
Unh!
And then
the light?up ornaments,
this will be our second year
doing the light?up ornaments.
What do your charge
for those?
$19.99.
They cost me $4.66.
?What?!
?$4.26.
Wait, for how many?
10 regular ornaments,
6 lights.
How long does it last?
About two days
of continuous usage.
But you can turn them on
and turn them off.
So you want them to burn out
so they buy again, right?
And how many people
really save a $10 item?
But acquiring
that customer,
it's a subset
of the male population.
Correct.
So, how are you
getting to them?
So, they say 55% of men
have some sort of facial hair,
but where we've been
really lucky is,
we've had a couple videos
go viral.
So, 130 million views...
?Wow!
?Wow!
...in 2017.
Cost me zero marketing.
And so
that was a huge influx.
O'Leary: But can you get that
every year?
No, but my goal last year
was to maintain the sales,
and I did.
We do a ton
of just e?mail blasts
out to existing customers,
so I increased sales.
What is your background,
though?
I'm a director of sales
for a telecom distributor.
I'm not an e?commerce guy.
I'm not a website SEO guy.
I mean, a lot of this
is just me bootstrapping
and shipping
from my basement.
Well, you're killing it.
And I've got some ideas
of where I want to take this.
One thing I think would be great
is sports licensing.
[ Laughing ]
Sports licensing?
Oh, with the Mavs logo
on it?
Sell them at the stadiums
with the Mavericks logo, right?
Or any NFL stadium
and get the licensing
to do little footballs.
I don't know
if that's a great idea.
So, what do you want
the $150,000 for?
I have four things.
It's the licensing.
I want to do other holidays,
so I think Hanukah, Gay Pride,
Independence Day.
Mm.
So there's that.
I don't know about that.
I also want to try
to get into retail
'cause I think
a $10, $20 item,
getting it on the shelves,
I think it'll sell quickly.
And then the fourth would be
just expanding internationally
or trying to broaden.
But, Jason,
you're crushing it.
This is the ultimate UFB.
This is, like ??
This proves
that even the corniest ideas
can make money
if implemented correctly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I mean, I really think
that you don't need us.
I mean, as much as
I hate to say that,
you're crushing it!
I mean, just put all that money
in your pocket.
This is, like,
a dream for most people.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I just don't see
how it'd be investable for me
in a way
that works for both of us,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Understood.
Thank you.
You know, great
that you thought of this.
I get it's kitschy,
it's fun.
I can see people with beards
loving it.
It is so, like,
in?the?garage kind of thing,
and look
what you've done with it.
Unbelievable.
And so, amazing.
Kudos to you.
But I agree with Mark 100%.
You don't need a Shark. You have
your own business going.
I think
you're doing great.
And I don't
say this often,
but I don't think
you need a Shark,
and so I'm out.
Okay.
And I appreciate that.
I think the reason I'm here,
it's not about the money for me.
I mean, luckily, like I said,
I do have a job,
but I think having someone
help me take this ??
We're doing half a million
in sales.
I think we could get this
to $3? to $5 million in sales.
Jason, I have no aversion
to making money off you.
Awesome.
But why is it worth
$1.5 million?
Right.
So, I think this year ??
'cause I pre?purchased
the inventory ??
I'm thinking
we're gonna do
around $250,000
to $300,000 in net.
So that's about
five times net profit.
Corcoran: I want to caution you
against one thing.
Yeah.
I invested
in a lot of businesses
that have one product
and a big hit,
and the biggest mistake
the entrepreneurs make
is to try to create
new markets for it.
When you said to me
you're thinking of doing
this holiday or that holiday,
I've seen that attempted
many times.
I've never seen it work.
Maybe come out
with new SKUs each year,
get return customers.
But I think that's what
the business is about.
I don't think there's room
for <i>any</i> partner, so I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you for the feedback.
Herjavec:
Jason, I think you have
a great brand, Beardaments.
This is a part?time gig
for you.
And there's nothing wrong
with that.
You're making
a boatload of cash.
Right.
But for me to invest,
I want to know you're all?in.
I wish you the best.
Not for me. I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
I give you $150,000.
How do I get it back?
By taking part
in those distributions,
and we'll figure out
how to grow the business, right?
And figure out
how to increase sales.
It's so crazy.
I'm looking at it
saying to myself,
"I am the only Shark here
who's made money selling..."
Crazy chicken things.
I Want to Draw a Cat for You.
Excuse me.
Excuse me! Tipsy Elves!
O'Leary:
Okay, I'll give you that.
That was stupid.
It kind of reminds me of,
like, my Potato Parcel deal.
Everybody thought it was a joke.
The guy's making a fortune.
I don't know.
It's tempting, it's tempting.
But I'm hair?challenged.
That's the problem.
Hey.
[ Laughs ]
?What?!
?[ Laughs ]
McOmber:
I understand that, Kevin.
Oh, one of those deals.
I'm gonna pass, Jason.
I'm just ?? It just...
It's...
Womp, womp.
It's great,
but it's frivolous.
That's the problem.
But that's you.
No.
I like money
as much as you do, Kevin.
I like that.
We'll figure out
how to make it work.
Ohh.
$150,000 for 25%.
?Thank you so much.
?Jason, congrats.
McOmber: Kevin is <i>the</i> guy ??
I mean,
from a licensing standpoint
and from the way
that he likes money.
I keep hearing terrible things
about Mr. Wonderful
and how he's the Grinch,
but this time, he really came in
and saved Christmas.
That's your kind of deal.
Kevin, you have a heart.
It's a Christmas miracle!
