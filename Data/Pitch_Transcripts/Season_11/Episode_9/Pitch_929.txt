I'm Christmas Kurt,
chief artificial
Christmas tree farmer
at Easy Treezy,
the world's easiest
Christmas tree.
Now, I know it's Christmas,
but where are all
the decorations for the Tank?
Mark, did you forget
to put up the tree again?
Always.
[ Chuckles ]
Maybe all we need
is a little Christmas magic.
Does anybody know any elves?
[ Cheering, laughter ]
Oh, there they are ??
the Easy Treezy elves!
I bet they can help!
Let's turn this tank
into a holiday masterpiece!
[ Cheering, laughter continue ]
Kurt,
tell us about yourself.
I got to know
how you came up with this.
I'm from Wisconsin originally ??
very rural town,
so we had forests
right behind our house,
and when Christmas came,
we'd go out
and chop down a Christmas tree.
And, you know, I always loved
the Christmas holiday.
It was very important to me ??
a lot from my mom.
She ended up getting
a disease called scleroderma
when I was in high school,
and I got to watch her,
unfortunately,
kind of deteriorate,
and she eventually
passed away in 2009.
Sorry.
So, you know, the holidays
were so special to her,
that she couldn't any longer
go out and cut down
that Christmas tree
and haul it in
and do the whole live thing.
So, one of the things was,
how do I make a Christmas tree
that a single person
can put up?
Because regular Christmas trees
are very, very heavy.
This was always in my head, is,
"How do I fix this problem?"
Hmm.
Tell us about
your sales.
2018, we did $605,000.
This year, we're projected
to do $2.2 million.
Wow!
So, if you're only selling
in the 210 stores for $299 each,
what percentage
of your sales are there
and what other platforms
are you selling on?
That percentage of business
is about 15% of our business.
Just 15%?
The retail, yes.
We do a big business
through Amazon.
As everyone knows,
it's kind of the beast.
And then we do have
a great direct?to?consumer
through our own website.
What percentage is
direct?to?consumer?
About 50%.
Okay, so, how much money
have you raised,
how much have you put in
yourself...
A lot.
...and how much debt
do you have?
[ Laughter ]
No debt,
but I'm all?in, man!
I'm all?in!
Sure sounds like it.
So, you've raised
no outside money?
I haven't raised
any money.
How much have you put in?
About $500,000.
Corcoran: That's hard money
to put into any business.
I know.
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
It's meaningful.
I tell my sister,
"Sometimes I feel like
I'm at the casino table
on blackjack
and the dealer's
showing the 6
and you've got the 11
here...
And you got to double down,
right?
I got my shoes on the table,
the watch is out there.
Everything's there!
O'Leary: All right.
Let me push a couple of buttons
here on price.
I'm in this space
with a deal called GeekMyTree.
Yeah.
We provided the lighting
for a lot of manufacturers.
Yes.
And I learned
all the price points.
Yes.
Selling a tree for over $200
is really hard.
Yes.
Really?
So, I'm assuming
these $600 trees
that you're selling,
premium market,
direct?to?customer...
Yes.
No retailer's
gonna touch that.
No.
So, how is it that you think
you can get to $2.2 million?
But that's the whole purpose
of the design, right?
Kurt: So, last year,
it was really data collection.
So we learned what the customer
is, who the customer is,
how they interact
with the website.
Were you doing Facebook ads,
Instagram ads?
We tested Instagram.
Instagram and Facebook
were okay,
Google performed
the best.
Cuban: So, how much
are you gonna spend
on digital advertising
for this season?
We have budgeted
about $120,000.
?That's it?
?That's it.
Look, I want to tell you
something.
I'm actually
related to Scrooge.
He's my uncle.
And I tell you
what's gonna happen here.
You are going to be
very disappointed
in how few you sell
at that price above $299.
Nobody is going to pay you $700
for this tree.
It's not gonna happen.
I hate this business.
I'm out.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you, Kevin.
But other than that, Scrooge,
how was Christmas?
What a grumpy guy.
Kurt, who does
your digital advertising
for you right now?
We have a contractor
that does it down out of ??
Okay.
To me,
that's the problem.
Your whole business is dependent
on your best skill
being your digital advertising
abilities.
Well, if I can ??
so, we presented this tree
to Home Depot in early 2018.
We were actually invited
to their PLR in China.
They gave us a verbal commitment
for 70,000 units,
which came in right around,
like, $8.5 million.
You didn't think
it was relevant to tell us?
I was getting there.
I've had a lot of questions!
So, we had
the verbal commitment.
So, what happened is,
at that point, you know,
the mold was very expensive
to make.
What we presented to them
was actually, like,
a handmade sample
because we were still trying
to get that developed.
Right. Sure.
So, they look at that,
and then they don't have
the confidence
that we can ship 70,000 units.
But now I have data
that I can go back to Walmart,
Lowe's, Home Depot ??
Okay, but still, Kurt,
what I'm saying is
the most profitable part
and the greatest upside
of your business
is what you sell
direct?to?consumer.
The key
to being successful there
is being
a great digital marketer.
I didn't get
a sense of confidence
that you really have that
under control.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Kurt, I love
the, uh, business.
Aesthetically,
I think it's beautiful.
And I love the reason
you started the company,
because I think it has a deeply
personal meaning to you.
But, to me, this business
is worth about $1 million.
Really?
For me to give you
$400,000,
I would need to own
40% of it.
[ Sighs ]
I don't think you,
with your shiny hat,
are going to
entertain that.
I mean, a million?dollar
valuation is...
It's a gamble.
You are in a very high ??
Is that an official offer,
by the way?
Robert is Kurt's last chance
of getting a deal
for his artificial
Christmas tree company,
Easy Treezy.
To me, this business
is worth about $1 million.
Really?
For me to give you
$400,000,
I would need to own
40% of it.
It's a gamble. It's a gamble.
You are in a very high ??
Is that an official offer,
by the way?
Kurt, I think
you're learning a lot,
and I think
Mark made the point.
I wish you had more
digital marketing expertise.
But you're learning that.
You'll get there.
No one's born great
at something.
You learn it
along the way.
Well, you know,
it's better to hire experts
than to do everything yourself,
you know?
We want to make sure that we get
the absolute best person to ??
Not always true.
When you start a business,
you got to be an expert
at what makes your business
grow and sell.
But the reality
of the situation is,
I am the only Shark
that's left.
I know.
Kurt,
what are you gonna do?
?Congratulations, Kurt.
?Listen. Good luck.
It's a nice tree.
It's a clever idea.
Thank you all.
Take care.
Merry Christmas.
Greiner: Bye. Good luck.
I wish we would've
landed a deal,
but, you know, life goes on,
and Easy Treezy will evolve
and live and, again,
will be in every house
in America at some point.
I thought
it was pretty.
You have to like
a skinny tree.
Oh, my God, Robert!
