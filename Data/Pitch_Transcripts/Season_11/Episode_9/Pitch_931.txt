Hi, Sharks.
My name is Bryan Perla.
I'm 21 years old, from
West Boylston, Massachusetts.
I am the owner and inventor
of Little Elf gift?wrap cutter.
Today, I'm seeking $150,000
in exchange
for 15% stake in my company.
Sharks, we all know
the holiday season is stressful.
Do we really need one more thing
to test our patience?
Like cutting wrapping paper
with scissors.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, Bryan!
Good job.
And right now,
I am actually a junior
at Stanford University
up in Palo Alto.
Wow!
Wow. You got over
your dyslexia.
What are you studying
at Stanford?
Product design. So,
it's the perfect match for me.
Perfect fit.
What are your sales
this year, and how much
money are you gonna make?
To date, we've done
$250,000 in sales.
Wow.
You're doing everything alone,
and you own it 100%?
I am running
the whole business myself.
I do have
a licensing agreement
with the world's
largest gift?wrap company.
So, my deal is,
for the next two to four years,
I get 10% to 13%
of retail sales only.
But I can sell online,
I can sell on QVC,
HSN, online shopping...
Have you been
on QVC, HSN?
We have not.
What is your cost
to make it?
$2.09.
Cuban:
So, it costs you $2.09.
What's your average
sales price?
$15.
So, you're selling
multiple units, typically.
Yep.
Bryan, you're killing it.
Your margins are, like, 80%.
Mm?hmm.
What else do you need?
Help with advertising.
You know, I haven't spent
a dime on advertising.
That's just to drive
your online sales?
Just to drive online sales.
Get on TV shopping
would be huge.
Someone sees it in action,
they're gonna fall in love
with it immediately.
Listen,
I think I've heard enough.
I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I feel I'd be a great partner
for you because this is visual.
And I think I could blow this up
on QVC and also elsewhere.
But I think you need help.
So, it would be
$150,000 for 30%.
Ohh.
So that we can be ??
Good thing
I'm here, Bryan.
Well, so that
we can be partners.
As a fellow dyslexic,
I'm gonna make you
an offer, too.
We're in the same club.
I'm not as greedy.
I, too, will bring you in
under my vendor co at QVC
and my team.
I will personally sell it
on my show.
[ Chuckles ]
We'll sell a ton of it.
Whoa!
A little competition.
Yeah,
we have competition.
But I'm gonna
structure it differently.
I'm gonna give you
$150,000.
I'm gonna apply a royalty
of $1 a unit you can afford
until I get back $450,000.
Then that goes away forever.
I want 10% of the company.
And I will blow it up huge
on Amazon and on your website.
Huge. It'll be insane
what happens.
You have two offers.
What do you want to do?
I mean, I ??
I thank you both.
I think it would be
foolish of me not to
listen to everyone else.
I have a question.
Yeah.
Repeat back to me
what Kevin offered you.
So, he offered me $150,000
for 10% with a...
$1 royalty.
...$1 royalty
until he gets back $450,000.
So, I'll do his deal,
but I'll go 75 cents
in royalty.
I'll drop it to 50 cents.
I'll drop it to 45 cents.
I'm helping you out here
a lot, I'd say.
I'll drop it to 40.
I'll drop it to 35.
That's gonna take 2...
...thousand years.
No, no, no.
[ Laughter ]
So, I would rather,
from my point of view,
have a partner
with just equity.
No royalty at all?
Yeah.
I have not taken any money
out of this myself.
I'm good with that.
So, my offer was
$150,000 for 30%.
Okay.
Do you want to counter?
I will offer $150,000
for 25%.
I can sell hundreds of thousands
of these in minutes in my show.
So can I.
I mean,
no offense to Kevin,
but my show
is way more popular.
No, that's not true
at all.
Yes, it is very true.
Oh, my God! It's so true!
That's not true.
No, that's not true.
But anyway,
I'll give you an offer ??
$150,000, 20%.
I hope you take it.
So, my last offer
was at 25%,
and you've dropped to 20%,
no royalty, straight equity.
Yes.
That's the deal?
What are you going to do?
Hey, Bryan, you are
one impressive guy.
I got to tell you,
you are the spirit
of what makes
this country great.
You didn't make excuses.
You overcame incredible odds.
I admire that.
It's not my space.
Both of these guys
are great.
I'm out.
I really appreciate your time.
Thank you. That's very kind.
Bryan, I'm gonna
clear the floor,
but I really want you
to encourage you.
I think you're fine
on your own.
I can't even imagine
what you'd need a Shark in.
I'm out.
Okay.
Cuban:
So, Bryan, I'm trying to get
a feel of where you want to go,
because one side says,
you know what?
You can make a lot of money
with the licensing play,
plus doing it
from your website,
plus just adding some SEO
for Amazon.
Yeah.
Right?
I know what Lori can do.
She can do great things.
But what's important here
is your vision
and how you want
to see it blow up.
I mean, I've sold over 1,000
successful products...
But that's not
what he's saying.
on QVC alone.
Bryan, don't you think
every Shark does that
with all of
their entrepreneurs?
We've been doing this
for 10 years.
No. <i>You</i> don't.
Lori's the only one that makes
money with their entrepreneurs.
Not with
my success rate, Kevin.
We <i>all</i> do it.
I sell all my deals on QVC,
including Lovepop Cards,
which has been
an unmitigated hit.
Yes.
And that's because of the
gifting seasons around holiday,
we kill it.
Bryan, what is it
that you want in a partner?
Yeah,
I want to answer that.
What is it that you want
for yourself? What's missing?
You want a dyslexic.
[ Laughter ]
Here I am, baby.
The retail license opportunity
is great.
You have that in your pocket,
though, right?
Yeah.
So, while the retail licenser
is, you know,
really growing
that business,
I just need to make sure
that I'm doing my due diligence,
and making sure
that it's a cool item
that someone can buy
online.
And you have two good offers.
I think Lori's at 20%.
Do you want to be
on TV, though?
I'm curious.
Like, would you want to be ??
My entrepreneurs
come on with me in my show.
Yeah.
You know,
it's very much a 50/50.
You could come on my show
and get some wine.
So, Bryan,
if that's the goal, right?
If you like that idea
of being on QVC and doing that,
it's not in my wheelhouse.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
You're out. okay.
O'Leary: Let's just
summarize the offers.
I've offered you the $150,000,
no royalty, for 25%.
Lori's at $150,000
for 20%.
The extra 5 is
for the Mr. Wonderful part.
'Cause there's only one
Mr. Wonderful.
I'm not discounting
myself.
Is there any way
you would work together?
No.
No?
That is not
the answer.
O'Leary:
We don't need to.
But you know in your heart
the right way to go.
Congratulations, Bryan.
It's done.
Come on, Kevin.
I'm so sorry
you made that mistake.
Herjavec: [ Laughs ]
Great job, Bryan!
Perla:
Lori's the perfect partner
for Little Elf
because, you know,
everyone watching QVC
is the perfect
target audience for this,
and I'm on there with her,
demoing it.
You know, like she said,
she could sell
hundreds of thousands
within minutes.
