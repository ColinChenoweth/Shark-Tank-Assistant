Hi, Sharks.
My name's Carson Grill.
Carson knows I like
to run a tight ship.
The question to you Sharks is,
does your paint closet
look anything like this?
Ooh!
If so, you have
half a dozen gallon cans
with just
<i>this</i> much paint.
So far, Carson's doing
all the talking.
You're not saying anything.
You know what?
I have all faith in him.
We run this business
50/50.
He knows
what he's doing.
I've gone to trade shows
with my dad.
I've gone to buyer meetings
with my dad.
One buyer,
we both walk in.
Carson, this is super impressive
how much you know your stuff.
Blake, I learned
the words "purchase order,"
"private label," you know,
"distribution" around 27.
He just spits them out.
'Cause you didn't get to watch
"Shark Tank."
Yeah.
Mycoskie: I would love to
help you grow this business,
so I would love
to make you an offer.
You're asking for $150,000
for 10%.
I'd like to give us some more
cash flow, some more runway,
so I'd like to do $200,000
for 25%.
Wow. Thank you so much
for that offer.
This guy just made a better
offer than I would,
Let Carson hear
a bid?ask situation.
No, but I was gonna give
$150,000 for 25%,
you've got there, Carson.
Oh. What a Shark.
Cuban:
So, I'll make it simple, guys.
I love you.
You guys are amazing.
But those guys
have made great offers,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, Mark.
?Congratulations.
?Thank you for your time.
My dilemma is this ??
I want Carson
Carson: I just finished
eighth grade.
I don't think that's
an option right now.
Carson,
what do you want to do?
Yeah, so, Blake, we really
weren't hoping to give up
25% of our company.
Carson: With Blake on our team,
the sky is the limit,
