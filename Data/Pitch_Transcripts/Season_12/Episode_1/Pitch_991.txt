Hi, Sharks.
My name's Carson Grill.
And I'm Jason Grill.
We're from Cincinnati, Ohio.
And I am the proud dad
to this CEO right here.
We are here today
seeking $150,000
in exchange for 10% equity
of our company.
Sharks,
just a few years back,
Carson and I were doing some
touch?up paint around the house.
With three kids,
fingerprints all over the walls,
believe me, there's always
touch?up to be done.
Being a former Marine,
Carson knows I like
to run a tight ship.
The question to you Sharks is,
does your paint closet
look anything like this?
Ooh!
If so, you have
half a dozen gallon cans
with just
<i>this</i> much paint.
We went to open
just a few cans, and oh!
The rust, clumps,
and smell.
We looked at each other
and said...
Both: "There has to be
a better way!"
So that's why I invented the
patented TouchUp Cup for paint,
the most innovative
solution
to all of your
paint storage problems.
It even has a stainless?steel
blending sphere for easy mixing.
Just shake and paint,
baby!
[ Rattling ]
Say goodbye
to rust and clumps forever.
TouchUp Cup
has extra threads
and an airtight
silicone seal
to keep paint fresh
for over 10 years.
We sell a three?pack
and an individual,
so whether you need a lot
or just a little,
we've got you covered.
But wait.
There's more.
There is?
We're already in...
Both: 4,000 locations!
Whoo!          Whoo! Oh.
Whoo!                      Whoo!
That <i>is</i> a whoo.
And we're not stopping
there, Sharks.
We'll keep going
until TouchUp Cup
is in every home, store,
and workshop around the world.
So, Sharks,
who wants to come...
[ Rattling ]
Both: ...shake and paint
with us?
Sharks, in front of you
are your very own TouchUp Cups
to try out for yourselves.
How old are you, again?
I'm 15.
Wow.
?That's great.
?That's awesome.
Do you have a patent on this
or...?
Yeah, so we have
a utility patent
on the use of the shape
of the cup
and the use of this ??
An application
or an actual patent?
Actual patent.
Wow.
Greiner: So, who is
running the business?
And you said
you're in 4,000 locations.
Yeah.
Tell us about that, too.
So, we're both running
the business right now.
We both have day jobs.
I'm in school.
I'm gonna be a freshman
in high school.
And my dad works
in medical sales.
We have a private label
partnership
with one of the most
recognizable brands
in painter's tape today,
and they are presenting us
to their 55,000
worldwide locations.
They have already gotten us
into 250 Meijer locations
across the Midwest.
And we are in all eight
distribution centers
of one of the largest hardware
co?op locations in the world.
And our private label partner
is getting us
into 2,000 locations.
And it's important to note
that we don't have
an exclusive
with this partner.
They're paying you a royalty
on unit sales?
No, it's a private label,
so we are the manufacturing.
So you're manufacturing
for them?
Yeah, so we do have
a strategic partnership
in Nashville, Tennessee,
that does all of our picking
and packing,
all of our EDI order entry.
And they do ??
we're about ??
I love this kid.
I love him.
Mycoskie:
The vocabulary is insane!
EDI ?? I didn't learn that
till my fifth year at Toms.
We're about 70% online
and 30% in retail right now
about our sales.
We have sold $220,000 in sales
over the last two years,
with $150,000 of that being over
the last year and a half
and $70,000 of that
being this year.
We got another shipment,
and we are on track
to do $400,000 in sales
this year.
?That's excellent.
?Wow. Good for you.
The three?pack costs you
how much landed?
$1.99 landed.
?Including packaging?
?Yes, and shipping.
?So $1.99.
?Landed.
The individual cup costs us
90 cents landed.
Okay, and what are you
selling them for?
The individual cup,
we wholesale for $1.89
and retail for
$3.99 to $4.99.
And the three?pack,
we wholesale for $4.25
and retail anywhere
from $9.99 to $12.99.
Normally on "Shark Tank,"
when you bring in your son,
usually, the father
gives the pitch
and the son does a little demo,
and then off they go
because things are gonna
get tough in the Tank.
So far, Carson's doing
all the talking.
You're not saying anything.
You know what?
I have all faith in him.
We run this business
50/50.
He knows
what he's doing.
I've gone to trade shows
with my dad.
I've gone to buyer meetings
with my dad.
One buyer,
we both walk in.
She looks me dead in the eye
and says,
"Oh, you brought your kid.
He can sit in the hallway,
I guess."
And I said, "Oh, no."
So that's when we pulled up
a chair out of the hallway,
and I led the meeting.
Oh, he went out,
he grabbed the chair...
Mycoskie: Nice!
...he pulled it in.
He's being modest.
He has four patents, okay?
A utility patent on
the TouchUp Cup.
Wow.
And three design patents
on the Muffin, Bagel,
and Doughnut Fresh.
Hold on. You're 15 years old,
and you have four patents.
Yes.
These are three
of my newest products ??
the Muffin, Bagel,
and Doughnut Fresh.
They are absolutely
a part of this deal.
They are
ergonomically designed
to keep muffins, bagels,
and doughnuts fresh
for three to four days longer
than conventional packaging.
So you're throwing that in?
Yes.
You're not selling those yet?
Well, it's about 5%
of our sales.
Carson, this is super impressive
how much you know your stuff.
Blake, I learned
the words "purchase order,"
"private label," you know,
"distribution" around 27.
He just spits them out.
'Cause you didn't get to watch
"Shark Tank."
Yeah.
Mycoskie: I would love to
help you grow this business,
so I would love
to make you an offer.
You're asking for $150,000
for 10%.
I'd like to give us some more
cash flow, some more runway,
so I'd like to do $200,000
for 25%.
Wow. Thank you so much
for that offer.
This guy just made a better
offer than I would,
and I was
about to give $100??
Let Carson hear
a bid?ask situation.
No, but I was gonna give
$150,000 for 25%,
and now he did ?? he did
$200,000 for 25%,
so I'm forced to do $200,000
for 17.5%
to cut his legs out
from underneath him.
O'Leary: Yes! Yes!
[ Laughter ]
Are you serious?
I'm serious.
Thank you for that offer.
That is
a really interesting dilemma
you've got there, Carson.
Oh. What a Shark.
Cuban:
So, I'll make it simple, guys.
I love you.
You guys are amazing.
But those guys
have made great offers,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
?Thank you.
?Thank you, Mark.
?Congratulations.
?Thank you for your time.
My dilemma is this ??
I want Carson
to drop out of school
and become a CEO.
Carson: I just finished
eighth grade.
I don't think that's
an option right now.
I'm out.
And I'd have to agree.
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.
John: But I do have to ask you
one question in regards to that.
Who will be running
the business?
'Cause I can't work on it
every day.
Blake can't work on it
every day.
Who's gonna work on it
every day?
Or will we have to hire
somebody else?
You know, if we were sitting
in your shoes,
we'd be asking
the same questions.
We want to get this
to a point
where I don't have to
have the other job.
But the time right now
is not right to ??
No, you're trying to keep
the lights on in the house.
I get it, right?
Yeah.
But at some time,
when you're working at midnight,
the buyers in retail,
they're up Monday morning
at 9:00 a. m.
calling people
saying "My shelves are empty."
And if you're not there to
pick up that phone at 9:00 a. m.,
they're calling
your competitor.
So who's gonna
pick up that phone?
Do we want to get this
to a point
where I can be full?time
in this business?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
But I can't
at this moment.
I'm gonna have to revise
my offer to $150,000 for 20%.
Carson and Jason have an offer
from Blake and one from Daymond
for their paint storage product,
TouchUp Cup,
but the offers are changing
once the Sharks discover
that no one is working full time
in the business.
I'm gonna have to revise
my offer to $150,000 for 20%,
'cause I see right now
that at least for a year,
it's going to have to take
administering money
to other people to go out
and do some of these jobs.
That's absolutely right,
Daymond.
I'm not changing
my offer.
You've gotten two very good
offers here from both of them.
Someone like Blake
or like Daymond could sit
and really work with you
and teach you
and give you
some good advice,
whereas I would want you to have
someone else run it for you.
So I'm gonna go out.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
I have a question
on your offer.
So, would you be willing
to fulfill purchase orders,
help us fulfill those
purchase orders on top of that,
if it got,
like, uncontrollable to us?
I don't know
until I get in there
and really understand
your business better.
But if I own 25%
of this business
and we need to, you know, fund
purchase orders or inventory,
you know, then it's gonna be
in my best interest to make sure
that I help arrange a line
of credit at a bank for you.
Daymond,
same question to you,
as far as
fulfilling purchase orders.
No.
I don't want
to be the bank.
I want to use
other people's money.
Carson,
what do you want to do?
Yeah, so, Blake, we really
weren't hoping to give up
25% of our company.
Would you be willing
to compromise and say 17.5%?
Carson: With Blake on our team,
the sky is the limit,
and we can reach
any level of success.
To all the kid?preneurs
out there, just like me,
you know that you can get
to this spot
with a little hard work,
you can do your research,
and you can be right here,
where I am.
Get a deal with
one of the Sharks,
and it feels amazing.
Mycoskie:
I was born in Arlington, Texas,
and grew up spending most of
my life practicing tennis.
I wanted to be
a professional tennis player,
but unfortunately, I had
a career?ending injury
that stopped my hopes
and dreams in the tennis world.
My first business was
a pickup?and?delivery
laundry service.
The only reason
I became an entrepreneur
was I had a need for someone
to come do my laundry
because I was on crutches
and couldn't carry my own
laundry down to the facility.
I went from knowing
nothing about business
to running a company in
three states with 40 employees.
By the time I was 29 years old,
I had created four businesses
and sold three of them.
Frankly, I was a little bit
exhausted and burnt out,
so I decided
to go to Argentina.
When I was in Argentina
and traveling,
one thing in particular
I witnessed
was really intense poverty,
and that really stuck with me.
Many of the children
were in the streets
when they should be in school,
and specifically,
not wearing shoes.
That's when I had the idea
to create a shoe business
where every time
we sold a pair of shoes,
we would give a pair
to a child in need.
We told them our vision,
and they thought
we were totally crazy.
Every business consultant
I talked to couldn't believe
that I was gonna give something
away every time I sold it.
But because it was so radical,
it differentiated us
and allowed us to become
one of the fastest?growing
shoe companies in the world.
Today, there are
thousands of companies
who have either emulated
the one?for?one model
or created a social cause
in their business.
To date, Toms has now
donated over 96 million shoes
to children around the world,
and we had reached sales
over $500 million a year.
After growing Toms
for eight years
and dedicating my life to it,
I realized I wanted to do more
as an entrepreneur,
and so I sold half
of the company in 2014.
Making small changes
in our lives
can truly transform them.
This led me on
a two?year pilgrimage
to meet some of the top
scientists in our country
on the state of well?being
and really thriving.
This experience led to me
launching a new company,
called Madefor.
Our hope with Madefor
is to teach everyone habits
and practices
that can truly transform
their lives
and help all of us
answer the question
"What am I made for?"
One of the things
I'm most excited about
is competing
with the other Sharks.
Most people know me
as this do?gooder,
but I'm really competitive.
Success to me means feeling
that you've done your best
to make the greatest impact
you can while on this planet,
knowing that you have given life
everything you can
and you've held nothing back.
