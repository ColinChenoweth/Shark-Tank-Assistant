Hi. I'm Chris.
And I'm Josh.
And we're two of the co?founders
of SparkCharge,
based in Somerville,
Massachusetts.
We're here today
seeking $1 million
for a 6% stake
in our company.
Everyone knows electric vehicles
are the future.
They're better
for the environment,
and soon,
they'll be everywhere.
But there's one major thing
keeping them
from growing faster ??
range anxiety.
Range anxiety is the fear
of running out of charge
in your electric vehicle.
That's why I would love
to introduce you to the Roadie,
the world's first
and only
portable, modular,
and ultrafast EV charger.
The anxiety of finding
a charging station
and the time wasted waiting
for a vehicle to charge
simply goes away
when the charging station
comes to <i>you,</i>
no matter where you are.
The Roadie has
three core features.
Number one ?? modularity.
Units can be
connected together
to give
the electric vehicle owner
the exact amount of range
they want.
Number two ?? portable.
Our portable units
can charge an electric vehicle
anytime and anywhere,
making any location
a charging station.
And, of course, the most
important factor ?? speed.
We can charge
an electric vehicle
at a rate
of one mile every 60 seconds.
So, Sharks, help us create
a more sustainable
mobile EV charging
infrastructure.
Okay, and walk us
through it.
So, how would I
purchase that?
John: Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Wait one second.
I don't know anything
about this. I'm out.
[ Laughter ]
Okay. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
So, yeah,
it's really simple.
So, we actually sell
directly to businesses.
So we work with OEMs,
roadside companies,
on?demand companies,
and service companies.
They use the hardware,
and they go out there
and they charge electric vehicle
owners who request it.
So AAA would carry this?
Is AAA a customer
right now?
We do have a program
going on right now.
The question is,
how much does it cost you
to make one of those
per module?
What do you sell them for?
So, per module,
our cost of goods
are roughly around
$2,500,
and then companies pay
a $1,000 deposit,
and then we charge them
a 150?buck monthly fee.
Okay, so it's 150 bucks
per month per module.
Yep.
Yes.
In the past
six months alone,
we've done close to over
half a million in sales,
and we're on track
to do over $1 million
in sales this year alone.
By end of next year,
we're predicting
to do close
to $10 million in sales.
This unit itself, it's patented
through and through.
We developed it
from the ground up.
We also built our own
manufacturing facility
in Buffalo, New York.
We've also been really strategic
with our funding,
but we've won a lot of grants
and awards to get us there.
How much money
have you raised from investors
versus grants
that you received?
I'd say we probably raised
about $3 million in venture,
and the rest
has been about awards,
which comes to about $2 million,
so about $5 million total.
?That's fabulous.
?Very smart.
And so what percentage of
the company do you guys own now
versus what
the investors own?
We have
a little over 50%.
But why do you believe
you'll go to $10 million?
You went from $500,000,
you double that ??
congratulations ??
to $1 million,
and now you're gonna
10x it.
Why do you believe
you'll go to that?
So, the electric vehicle
industry is growing rapidly.
Essentially, the reason
that we're here today ??
and that's a great point ??
is that we need to scale
to keep up with demand.
O'Leary: Obviously,
you have to burn some cash
to get to
where you are now.
How much have you lost
to get to here?
Since the beginning,
I think the burn rate is
just a little over
about 4 mill.
So you guys are in a bad spot
right now?
No. No, we have runway.
No.
You've raised
$4 million, right?
We've raised
$5 million total.
Okay, and you spent 4,
so you got a million left.
Correct.
And in order to grow,
you need to invest
to build more batteries.
Correct.
O'Leary: Alright.
You're basically leasing
these things to people, right?
Correct.
Mm?hmm.
How much capital do I have
to tie up in inventory?
That's probably the best way
to ask that question.
About a third.
You're basically going to carry
a third of revenue as leased.
In other words, you own it.
It's on your balance sheet.
Wouldn't it be better
to simply sell this
and then let the attrition occur
in the market?
Because I think
that's a big issue.
So, you know, we could sell it,
but by leasing it out,
essentially,
we control the asset, and then
when the batteries come back,
we can also repurpose them.
Okay, so, tell me again
what it costs you to make.
$2,500.
And so
your payback time is...
Approximately 12 months.
How much are you charging, then,
if it's 12 months
and if it's $150 a month ??
They pay
a $1,000 deposit.
Oh, they pay $1,000...
Is it a deposit, or is it an
actual $1,000 of revenue?
It's a $1,000 deposit.
It's nonrefundable.
So it's not a deposit, then.
It's actually a $1,000 payment.
Yes.
Greiner: I really love
what you're doing here.
And I also think that
you can have
a direct?to?consumer end of this
down the road
where they can put in their cars
something smaller
but will give them
that little bit of peace of mind
where they can get to somewhere
where they're safe.
So, we are gonna be coming out
with a consumer product.
The technology inside
is somewhat the same.
It's just smaller size,
lighter package,
more consumer?friendly look.
What will that retail for?
Depending on scale, we might be
able to get it for under $1,500.
How many units are being
used right now ?? today?
Around 50.
Yeah.
50.
Oh, that's all?
Only 50 units?
You're backordered right now,
then?
Yes.
Correct.
I hate the lease part
of the deal.
I hate owning risk.
That part ??
you lost me there.
I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
We appreciate it.
Thank you for your time.
Like Lori,
I think the big opportunity
is developing
a consumer unit,
but I find it
really hard to believe
that you're gonna deliver
a consumer unit
for 1,000 bucks or less
when your commercial units
are thousands.
And so for that reason,
I'm gonna be out.
Like I said,
I think it's super smart,
it is innovative.
Mark is Mr. Technology.
Like, I will always look to him
to understand things
[ Laughing ] that I don't
actually understand.
But this is more
a capital issue.
So, are you interested,
Mark?
'Cause I'll go in.
Yeah, I like the concept,
right?
So, here's the challenge,
right?
The challenge is
it's a lot of cash up front,
and you're gonna have to
borrow money, not raise money,
because if you raise more money,
then you guys aren't gonna have
any ownership left,
right?
Unless you think it's gonna be
a multi?billion?dollar company.
We do believe it's gonna be
a multi?billion?dollar company.
According to our estimations,
we can get to profitability
without having
to raise additional rounds
by middle of next year.
So, here's the thing.
Okay.
6% is nowhere near enough,
particularly for two of us,
right?
So, Lori, I think
the best way to do this
is to let them make us an offer,
and we either say yes or no.
So you know
what your number is.
Instead of us
trying to figure out your number
and us going back and forth,
in the interest of time,
just give us your number,
right?
And if we like it, we say yes,
and if we don't, we say no.
Ellis: It was the most
exhilarating ride of my life.
We really want to dig in
and start building this business
to be
a billion?dollar business.
With the power
of Lori and Mark,
SparkCharge is now fully charged
to take over the world.
People don't realize,
when you raise money,
it's not an accomplishment ??
it's an obligation.
Exactly.
But our media celebrates it.
They celebrate raising money
as if that's like profitability.
