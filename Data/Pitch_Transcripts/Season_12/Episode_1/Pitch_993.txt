My name is
Pete Badaway,
and this is
my beautiful wife, Bianca.
We're seeking $100,000
for 10% equity in our company.
Sharks, we want
to introduce you to Joe.
Joe here,
he's just like all of us ??
gets up,
gets himself ready,
puts his mask on,
and heads off to work.
The second Joe leaves his house,
these nasty little germs,
which are filled with odor,
dirt, grime, and even bacteria
are flying at him
from all different directions.
[ Laughter ]
I love it.
Whether he's grabbing
a quick latte...
Yes!
...at a crowded cafe,
walking past
a sneezing co?worker,
and let's not forget
all those nasties
he picks up during his commute
to and from work.
He's washing and cleaning
his hands throughout the day,
but what's he doing
about his clothes?
Nothing, Sharks.
He does nothing.
That crazy, nasty dirt that he's
collecting throughout the day
is still stuck
on his clothes.
Let's face it, Sharks ??
we can't all walk around
with these things on all day
to keep us protected.
There are products to wash
and clean our hands on the go,
but why not for our clothes,
which are even more exposed?
And that...
Both: ...is why
we created GarmaGuard!
GarmaGuard
is the first natural
garment and fabric cleanser
of its kind,
which uses natural propellants
to keep you safe
and your clothes
fresh and clean.
Applying our garment spray,
it's easy.
You simply just spray it
onto your clothes.
Helps eliminate odor,
freshen your fabric,
and keep that dirt and grime
under control.
There you go, Joe.
Much better.
So, no matter who you are
or what you do...
GarmaGuard gives you
the freedom to live your life
without having to wear
one of these things on all day
to keep you protected.
So, which one of you Sharks
wants to team up with us
to help
GarmaGuard the world?
Sharks, we have some samples
in front of you.
First, we're gonna
get out of these suits
and get Joe on his way
out of here.
I really enjoyed
that high school play.
Yeah, that was fun.
O'Leary:
It was very good bad theater.
Okay, so, my very first business
was a pickup?and?delivery
laundry and dry cleaning
company.
Yes, we know that.
This could really save someone
a lot of money on dry cleaning,
'cause half of the reason
people would
bring their clothes to me,
especially in college,
their clothes
smelled like smoke.
So my first question is,
is, like ?? will this
take away smoke smell
and not have to take it
to the dry cleaning?
Absolutely.
We're getting amazing feedback
from firefighters.
And I'm a police detective
myself,
so I work very close
to firefighters,
[ Spray hisses ]
and they call me,
they're like,
"Pete, this stuff's
really good."
Wow. It works.
I mean, the thing is,
is very few people
ever wear socks
when they wear Toms,
and if you don't wear socks,
they start to stink.
And [Sniffs]
there's no odor.
How does it work?
How does it extract the odor?
It actually eliminates
odor?causing bacteria.
So it's killing
the bacteria?
Yes, it is. Yeah.
It's lab?tested.
It does kill bacteria,
kills 99% of germs.
We can't
make those claims
because we're not
EPA?registered yet,
so we're selling it
as a cleaner now,
but we know
how effective it is.
Viruses, too, then?
Yes.
COVID?
Uh...
[ Laughs ]
That's a big question.
Yeah, we don't have
that kill claim yet.
I mean, that's clearly
the way...
We're working on that.
...that your sales are gonna
grow in time, is if ??
Well, with that in mind,
tell us about your sales.
We've been in business
for a year and a half now.
To date,
our sales are $476,000.
Alright, half a million dollars
of sales is not a joke.
You know,
that's a good number.
Is this your business that
you've always been in or...?
So,
I'm actually a nurse.
I've been working
up until three months ago,
when we had
our third daughter, so...
?Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
So, the idea came up,
actually, from being a nurse.
I would come home,
and I wouldn't
want my girls touching me.
I wouldn't want Pete
giving me a hug yet.
I felt so dirty
after my shift.
And just watching this
day after day,
I knew that
we needed a product
to use on our clothing,
on our uniforms,
on our scrubs throughout our day
before we come home.
And if none exist,
we need to make one.
So, where are you
selling it right now?
What are you doing
to amplify your sales?
So, right now we're selling
on our website,
as well as
a couple other websites.
You're only online right now?
Yes.
Okay, so, how much
do you sell these for,
and what does it
cost you to make?
So, we sell them for $12.99,
and they cost $1.85 to make.
Okay, so you got enough
margins to support...
?Nice!
?Yeah, nice margin.
So, guys,
you made these sales,
but the golden ring here,
it seems to me,
given where we're at
in this pandemic,
if this said "Kills COVID
on your clothes,"
I think that would be
a really good message.
We're gonna get it.
100%.
Mycoskie:
What's the timeline to get that?
'Cause I think
that's the question
that we're all gonna ask
and we're all gonna focus on.
Because that will change
your business dramatically.
Six months to a year, I would
say, if I had to estimate.
Cuban: Look, guys,
look, it's a great product.
It smells good,
obviously works real well.
But every day,
I get an e?mail
from somebody saying
they have this new,
whiz?bang formula, and you guys
hear about competition
all the time, I'm sure,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So the reality is, you have to
be a great marketing company,
and you're just starting
to learn how to do that.
So I don't think you're quite
ready for my investment.
I'm out.
Alright.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
Appreciate that.
Guys, I understand why you can't
give me what I want.
What I wanted was a little
picture of the coronavirus
with a big red X
through it.
That's why
we need your help!
We're working on it.
I know, I know.
We started this in 2017.
To me,
that's the marketing dream.
But it's not just COVID,
Mr. Wonderful.
I mean, this feeling
of cleanliness
and staying sanitized and clean
isn't going anywhere.
No, I get it. I get it.
That's gonna be there
for a long time.
Listen, guys, it's not for me,
but you two are terrific.
Thank you.
Anyways, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
I think that this is
a good enough business
that you may not
need a partner.
I think you guys can scale this
to being $1 million, $2 million
and doing it
without a partner.
So I'm out.
Appreciate that,
Daymond.
You know, I think that
this is a really good product.
I think
it smells fantastic.
And I think you're right
on the money right now.
People would just love to take
something fresh and non?chemical
and spray it
on their clothes afterwards.
Right.
I'm absolutely going
to be a customer.
I like it a lot.
But it's just so early.
I think you're gonna do great,
but I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Appreciate the feedback.
Thank you.
Then there was one.
Yeah.
Man, it's tough.
Laundry days. Laundry days.
Come on.
Before I make
my final decision,
there's one question I never
got answered, and that is,
your total sales
have been $476,000
over the lifetime
of the business.
What's your sales gonna be
this year
and what's your profitability
gonna be this year?
'Cause you have
huge margins.
Yeah.
So, we'll hit at least
$500,000 this year,
and our margins
are around 20%,
so we'll make $100,000
off that $500,000.
