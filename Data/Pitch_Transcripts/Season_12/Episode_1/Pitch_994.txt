Hi. My name's Wylie,
and I'm here to tell you
about my company, Rumpl.
But first, Sharks,
I got to ask you a question.
How do you sleep at night?
I'm guessing it's under
a cozy, warm blanket, right?
Blankets are the best,
and they've been keeping people
warm and comfortable
for centuries.
But it's been decades
since anybody's thought
to give them an upgrade.
Meanwhile, we've seen
a textile revolution happening
in outdoor gear
and athletic apparel.
Sharks, Rumpl has taken
these proven new?age materials
and created a line of durable,
weatherproof,
lightweight blankets.
They're extremely versatile,
warm and cozy,
and can travel with you
from the home
to the outdoors and back.
They repel pet hair...
...debris...
...and stains.
Come on.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Don't waste wine.
It's cheap stuff.
Don't worry.
That's the best stuff.
Rumpl blankets
will keep you protected.
But the thing
I'm most proud of, Sharks,
is protecting the planet.
Each of these blankets
is made using
60 recycled plastic bottles
that might otherwise
end up in landfills.
Awesome.
Additionally,
we offset 100%
of our carbon footprint
every year
and donate 1% of all sales
to environmental causes
because we care about
protecting the places
that inspired the idea for Rumpl
in the first place.
I'm seeking $600,000
for a 4% stake
of this booming company.
Of course you are!
Of course you are.
There we go.
There are samples for you
on your tables in front of you.
Please, let's get cozy
and get to it.
And where do you sell?
Where do you sell and how?
We're selling online.
Amazon.
We're in every REI.
I actually bought one
in REI.
Oh, right on.
You know the product.
I'm a customer.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
I think the product's great.
I don't really like
the valuation right now,
but we'll talk
about that more.
I got to tell you,
this is on me right now.
Yeah.
It is really warm.
Yeah.
To be so thin is amazing.
Daymond, you look
like a grandmother.
I'm happy, though,
looking like a grandmother.
What is in the inside?
What is the ??
So, the ones you guys
have right there,
they have a hollow
fiber synthetic fill.
It's basically like
a bucatini pasta tube.
But it's a fiber fill?
Yes. Exactly.
Instead of just looking
at the technical aspects
of the blanket ??
I mean, it's great.
I have one. I'm a customer.
But this reminds me a lot ??
when I started Toms,
like, we had a shoe
that a lot of people could copy.
So there's nothing in this
blanket that doesn't mean
that I can't start a company
just like it tomorrow.
Sure.
But what's most important
to me, Wylie, is like,
why did you get passionate
about blankets?
Sure.
I was on a ski trip with
a friend just outside Mammoth,
and our car froze.
It was, like, the coldest night
on record in Mammoth.
And we woke up the next morning,
car wouldn't start,
and we were several miles
up a dirt road.
We had no cell service.
So it was kind of a sketchy
situation we found ourselves in.
And we bundled up
in our sleeping bags,
and we started talking
about how,
"Man, you know,
I really like these materials
so much more than
my comforter back home."
And we decided, you know,
"When we get out of here,
we're gonna make
a sleeping bag blanket."
We bundled up
in our sleeping bags
and just waited
for somebody to show up.
It was several hours
before somebody eventually did.
So, what does one cost?
What do these ??
100 bucks.
Mycoskie:
And what's your landed cost?
$25.
25 bucks.
So it's a good margin.
And then are you selling
it wholesale? What?
$50.
$50? Okay.
$49.50, actually,
'cause it's $99.
And can you just take us
through, like,
the year you started and
what the sales ramp?up has been?
Yeah, so, we started
end of 2013.
2014, we did 450K in sales,
then $950,000, 2.7,
5.3...
John: Ohh.
...8.8...
Greiner: Wow!
...6.5.
Oh. Ouch.
And I'll explain that.
And then this year,
we're on track for 8.
What happened
to that big drop?
Bet you lost
a wholesale account.
No ?? Well, yes.
Yes. Of course.
Actually,
what happened is,
in 2018, when we did 8.8,
$3 million of that
was really just with
two large corporate accounts.
How many competitors are doing
pretty much the exact thing
right now in the wholesale
channel and direct channel?
There's probably
a good 15 companies
doing something similar
to what we're doing.
Whoa.
15. This is the big problem,
I think.
Yeah.
Because, I mean, no disrespect
to the business right now,
but to have this level
of valuation
and have zero barriers to entry
and 15 competitors,
that makes me really scared
as an investor.
And before you leave,
because your valuation
is $15 million,
you do have to bring up
how much money
you're going to make
off the $8 million.
Oh, yeah, we're gonna peek
under the blanket on that one.
It's gonna be about
5%, 6% this year,
so $400,000 to $450K.
Only 5% to 6%?
Pre?tax? Pre?tax?
That's the profit?
Yeah, pre?tax.
So, how much money
have you raised?
Yeah. I really want to talk
to you guys about this
because I know this is gonna be
a sticking point here.
No. You don't say.
[ Laughter ]
Rumpl has raised
a good amount of money.
We've done two seed rounds.
Both of those equaled
about $1 million.
And then in 2018,
we did a proper A round,
and we raised $3.8 million.
So, that leads
to the next question.
How much cash
do you have in the bank?
$3.5 million.
Whoa.
Why are you here?
Wylie needs an investment
from the Sharks
for his outdoor blanket company,
Rumpl.
How much cash
do you have in the bank?
$3.5 million.
Whoa.
Why are you here?
I am here because I would like
to take this product
and this brand
into sports licensing.
Worst excuse <i>ever</i>
to be here.
You could have bought as many
licenses as you want with that.
You just call Fanatics,
you call the NBA.
You know how to get a license.
You've done ??
I don't. I don't.
Seriously, I don't.
You have 3?point?something
million in the bank.
You got enough to hire people
to go out and do licensing
and to acquire
the licenses.
Where my team is focused...
You know what? I'm trying
to figure out ?? Listen.
Listen, listen, this ??
...where my salespeople
are focused is in outdoor.
Wylie, listen ??
I don't want to distract them
for this other channel.
Worst excuse ever.
Mycoskie:
Mark, what do you think?
Do you think he's here
for the exposure? s
No.
Or do you think
he really wants us to invest?
Yeah, Wylie, look,
I'm not buying the whole
"I can't get sports licensing
help without you guys."
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary:
You know, Wylie,
it takes my breath away
that you would come in here
and ask me to pay you 50 times
free cash flow for blankets.
We don't really need the cash.
What we need is a partner.
And what I'm willing to talk
about is a loan with a royalty.
Did you say "royalty"?
I said "royalty."
Was I being nasty to you?
I take it all back.
No, no, it's all fair.
Okay.
Do you know why, Wylie? 'Cause
you have something called sales.
Hit me.
What do you got?
Alright, so, I would like
to potentially structure this
as a $600,000 loan,
10% interest
paid back over 2 years,
and then 5%
of all revenue generated
in the sports license channel.
John: I'm gonna make you
an offer.
A loan at $600,000
at 10%
and 5% of sales
for 2 years.
That's crazy.
Hold on.
So when my Sun?Staches guys
came on here, they had nothing.
I got them all of Disney,
all of Marvel,
Pokémon, sports license ??
all of that stuff.
Daymond, I think we should
do this together.
If you can help
grow those channels,
I know I can help
in the DTC.
Blake and I will give you
$600,000 at 10%.
That's a loan.
I would go
after licenses for you.
Blake, you're gonna go
after wholesale.
Yeah, I mean, I can literally
grow his wholesale
by 500% tomorrow.
So, 2.5% to each of us
for two years
on all sales.
And then that's done.
And we get 4% equity.
O'Leary: I'll give you
the $600,000,
I'll take 4%,
but we're not gonna
call it a loan.
I'm just gonna say
give me 10 bucks a blanket
till I get back
$1.8 million,
and I keep the 4%
because I became your partner
in my "Shark Tank" portfolio.
And I'd rather just take
the 600
and pour it
onto direct sales.
That's it.
You don't have to go nuts.
I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna do.
You're paying half
your free cash flow.
What do you got, Lori?
I'm out.
[ Laughs ]
Cuban: Good call, Lori.
Alright.
Yeah, so, Daymond,
I think we need more equity
after doing this math.
We're gonna do a ton of work
on this business.
So, the deal is
$600,000 loan at 10%,
2.5% to me and to Daymond
for two years,
and 10% equity.
The deals keep on
getting worse for you.
I mean, that's ??
No. That's a ??
I like the Mr. Wonderful
offer better.
I like the Mr. Wonderful offer
better than that one, as well.
[ Laughter ]
How about this, Blake?
I'll be honest.
That's fine. There's gonna be
a lot of deals today.
I was really excited when
I learned that you were
gonna be the guest Shark.
And I'm stoked on <i>you.</i>
I've admired you
as an entrepreneur
and an individual
for a long time.
Thank you.
What if we do $600,000
as a loan,
10% interest
paid back over two years,
2.5% royalty on sales
for two years...
Okay.
...and 4% equity?
So it's the same offer
I came in...
Now he's back to
where you were before.
...plus the royalty.
O'Leary: You're gonna have to
give up 10% to get two Sharks.
And really, you've already said
you want to be dating Blake.
You're not going to the dance
with Daymond.
I have.
Yeah.
I mean, you can throw
Daymond under the bus,
which you're about to do,
'cause there's no way
you're giving up 10%.
That's right.
I'm not giving up 10%.
What do you want to do?
That's the decision.
Alright, so, I'm gonna
give you clarity for this one.
I don't want to get in the way,
so I'm out.
I appreciate that, Daymond.
No disrespect, honestly.
No disrespect taken.
Look, the thing is,
is I was excited to do a deal
with Daymond on the licensing,
but I also just have to look
at the value of my time.
And I'm only gonna focus on two,
maybe three investments a year.
I'm gonna get involved
like a founder,
and so I need to be <i>treated</i>
like a founder.
And unless I have
10% equity,
I just won't feel
like a founder,
and I won't be motivated to
help you as much as I want to.
And that 10%'s
just as low as I can go.
What are you gonna do,
Wylie?
