Hi. My name's Wylie,
Sure.
But what's most important
to me, Wylie, is like,
why did you get passionate
about blankets?
Sure.
I was on a ski trip with
a friend just outside Mammoth,
Wylie needs an investment
from the Sharks
for his outdoor blanket company,
Rumpl.
How much cash
do you have in the bank?
$3.5 million.
Whoa.
Why are you here?
I am here because I would like
to take this product
Wylie, listen ??
I don't want to distract them
for this other channel.
Worst excuse ever.
Mycoskie:
Mark, what do you think?
Do you think he's here
for the exposure? s
No.
Or do you think
he really wants us to invest?
Yeah, Wylie, look,
I'm not buying the whole
"I can't get sports licensing
help without you guys."
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary:
You know, Wylie,
it takes my breath away
that you would come in here
Do you know why, Wylie? 'Cause
you have something called sales.
Hit me.
What do you got?
Alright, so, I would like
to potentially structure this
as a $600,000 loan,
10% interest
paid back over 2 years,
What are you gonna do,
Wylie?
