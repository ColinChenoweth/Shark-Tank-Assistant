Hi, Sharks.
I'm Emily Williams.
Emily: Our focus for the first
12 months is really online.
We know that there's
a retail play here.
We've had a lot
of retail interest.
We don't want to go there first,
'cause it's expensive.
But then after we ??
we do head into retail,
there's a food service play,
whether it is stadiums
or quick service restaurants
Emily does know numbers.
Do you want to hear
the offer or not?
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.
Because right now,
it's the <i>only</i>
offer you have.
So I suggest you focus.
All right?
Let's do it.
I'm going to give you
the $200,000
against a 10 cent royalty
per package
Emily, you know,
the only offer you have
is from Chef Wonderful.
Now, as these Sharks
drop out,
that gives me more,
I don't know, leverage.
