Hi, Sharks.
I'm Emily Williams.
And I'm Cole Williams,
Emily's husband.
And we're seeking $200,000
in exchange for 10%
of our business.
We're not here to talk
about a problem.
We're here to talk
about catastrophes.
We're talking
sandwich catastrophes!
How about those
pesky packets?
They're tough to open,
impossible to spread,
and they're never
the right amount.
And what about soggy buns?
That's the worst!
Aaah!
Well, fear not,
my Sharky friends.
Your saucy heroes
have arrived
with Slice of Sauce.
Slice of Sauce transforms
traditionally
bottled condiments
like ketchup, Sriracha,
barbecue sauce,
mustard, and more,
into mess?free slices.
It's flavor
in a new form.
Just like
a slice of cheese,
but it's your favorite
condiment or sauce.
We use only
the finest ingredients
and a unique process
to bring bold flavor
and the perfect bite
every time.
So, Sharks...
Together: Who wants
a slice of this sauce?
[ Sharks chuckling ]
So, are we ready
to eat?
Cuban: Let's eat.
Yes.
Who's hungry?
I'm always ready to eat.
Rodriguez: Always!
Cole: So, you guys,
in front of you,
you have
a grilled cheese sandwich
with Slice of Sauce
Classic Ketchup
and Spicy Sriracha,
which does have some heat.
Ooh, wow, heat.
Yeah.
Packs a punch.
Cuban: Got some kick.
Yeah.
This is pretty damn cool.
Let me just tell you.
That is a good idea.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Is this real ketchup
that's just been ??
the water has been removed?
Exactly. Yeah.
We are removing the water.
So what's proprietary
about that?
Why can't you be knocked off
by the big ketchup guys?
Very good question.
[ Laughs ]
A couple of reasons.
One, we do have
a unique process.
We've opted for
trade secret,
so we've foregone
the patent.
We also have licensing
agreements on deck
with McCormick and Stubb's
and Frank's,
Tapatío,
and Secret Aardvark.
How long is the shelf life
of this?
Because it's not
refrigerated, right?
It's not refrigerated.
Correct.
It's an ambient product.
It has a 12?month
shelf life.
Greiner: It's interesting.
Cole: Yeah.
I mean, it's almost
like a Fruit Roll?Up.
Yeah.
But this is ketchup.
We liken it a lot
to a slice of cheese.
Yeah.
Right?
It's the same use case.
It tastes really good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What does this sell for,
and what is the cost to make it?
That retails for $5.99.
Our cost is $1.75.
So do you think that's high?
You only get eight servings.
You can dress eight hamburgers.
It's over.
Whereas with my
tomato ketchup bottle,
I'm going to have it for, what,
maybe 20, 30 hamburgers.
We are a premium product,
and we would like
to stay positioned
that way.
This really isn't just
a slice of ketchup.
This is flavor.
What are your sales so far?
So, we launched a Kickstarter
campaign in 2018,
and it went viral
within about four days.
We raised $34,000,
and our goal was $15,000.
And then your sales after
that point were what?
We are still pre?revenue
and will launch in November.
?Oh.
?Oh.
But I'd love to tell you about
what we've been doing...
Oh.
...over the last
two years, because...
So, wait, wait, wait.
Just so we're clear.
...it's never
been done before.
No sales.
You put the Kickstarter on
in 2018,
and here, two years later,
you're still pre?revenue?
Correct.
So the question is...
Let us tell you the story.
...que pasa, hombre?
Yeah.
Yeah. [ Laughs ]
So we discovered
really quickly
that manufacturing this
is really hard.
So, how are you
making these?
We've been manual, which is
why we have not yet launched,
is because we've had
such huge demand ??
You can't find a co?packer
to take this and run with it?
You need machinery?
We do need machinery,
and that's why we're here today.
This, Barbara,
to your point,
will help us
bring down costs.
How much money have you
put into it yourself?
We've invested about $120,000
of our own cash.
But?
And we've also raised
about $500,000.
Whoa!
So we raised ??
From who?
We raised a friends and family
round of $300,000
on a convertible note
at a $3 million cap.
Oh, God.
We also participated in
Techstars Accelerator.
They gave us $100,000.
This is a down round.
No.
The last valuation
was actually at $5 million.
So it is in fact
a serious discount
because we really want to
partner with a Shark.
I have to say, I find it
absolutely amazing
that you were able to raise
$300,000
from your family and friends
plus $100,000
and say confidently
that you have this valuation
when there hasn't been
a single bag sold.
I would like to believe
in that kind of magic
because I love magical things,
but I don't.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thanks, Barbara.
Okay. Thank you, Barbara.
What is your plan for growth,
and what is your plan
for world domination?
Yeah!
Corcoran: Oh, my gosh.
Emily: Our focus for the first
12 months is really online.
We know that there's
a retail play here.
We've had a lot
of retail interest.
We don't want to go there first,
'cause it's expensive.
But then after we ??
we do head into retail,
there's a food service play,
whether it is stadiums
or quick service restaurants
or grab and go
sandwich kiosks.
To me, it's extremely important
to know three things
when you're trying to
bring to market a product ??
is it something
that people need and want,
can it be done
at an affordable price...
?Mm?hmm.
?Mm?hmm.
...and does it solve
a problem?
Right?
So you you gave the problem.
I don't think
it's a huge problem
of not being able to carry
around your condiments.
But the complexity here for me
is I don't know the need.
And is it something that can be
made at an affordable price?
You don't know yet.
So I like the innovation,
but I'm out.
I think the Sharks
have a good point,
and I don't know
how you're going to address it,
'cause you don't have
enough data yet.
But I'm going to
make you an offer
structured against
the risk I see here,
because you need a Shark
to help blow this thing up.
I'm going to give you
the $200,000,
and I'm going to put
a royalty structure on it
to a limit of $700,000.
In other words, I want...
[ Laughs ]
...10 ?? Excuse me, Mark.
I don't need any noise.
Buckle your seat belt.
Yeah, exactly. Clip, clip.
Whoa!
Emily does know numbers.
Do you want to hear
the offer or not?
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.
Because right now,
it's the <i>only</i>
offer you have.
So I suggest you focus.
All right?
Let's do it.
I'm going to give you
the $200,000
against a 10 cent royalty
per package
until I recoup $700,000,
and the royalty goes away.
And I'm going to ask
for 5% equity.
I'm the only chef up here.
Chef Wonderful.
[ Laughter ]
The rest of these guys
are ignorant
in the ways
of the kitchen.
Rodriguez: He said his offer
is better than nothing.
Maybe nothing
is better than that.
Thanks, Alex.
Well, let's hear
your offer, Alex.
What are you forecasting
revenue year one?
We'll start in November,
and we're forecasting
1.8.
1.8?
How are you going to
accomplish that, by the way?
So, we have our website,
we have Amazon,
and we have Thrive Market
that we're going to
partner with.
Look, Amazon will be
interesting,
but you've got to go through
such a process
to educate people, right?
I mean...
Emily, you know,
the only offer you have
is from Chef Wonderful.
Now, as these Sharks
drop out,
that gives me more,
I don't know, leverage.
It does, it does.
And my offer may change.
Emily and Cole have an offer
on the table from Kevin
for their unique condiment
company, Slice of Sauce.
Does anybody else ??
Yes, I would start
asking that.
That would be a good idea.
Cuban:
Okay, let's throw down.
I see these
as a proof of concept
that are going to be
really hard to sell.
No chance you're doing
1.8 million of these
selling online
because people
aren't gonna know
what to expect
in terms of taste, right?
It's the weird stuff that
you otherwise would not have
in your refrigerator...
Cole: Yeah.
...that's going to work.
And I think you hit the key,
too. It's refrigerator.
We're not looking
at the refrigerator.
We're looking at places
where the refrigerator
isn't, right?
Right.
So it's a picnic.
It's a camping trip.
It's an RV.
But still ??
But you've got to
look at it,
where are my
buying decisions made?
Because you're
a new category.
People aren't going to think,
"I need sliced ketchup."
It's just not
gonna happen.
Mark, it sounds like
you're on the fence.
Obviously.
Mark, you're on the fence.
I'm not.
I'm gonna make them
an offer, okay?
Do what you got to do.
We live on the road.
We have four kids.
?Yeah.
?Totally.
We're watching football games,
concerts, baseball.
But you said something
earlier, Cole,
that I really liked ??
mess?free.
Yeah.
Now, with four kids,
that's a premium in my house.
Yeah.
So there's two rules
in investing, as I see it.
Rule number one
is don't lose money.
Right.
Rule number two is
don't forget rule number one.
Yeah.
Okay?
So I'm going to make
this investment
as convertible debt.
Okay.
I'm going to offer you
$200,000 for 20%.
When you hit your 1.8...
Mm?hmm.
...it will convert into equity.
Okay.
That's my offer.
Okay.
You understand
the dilution of that.
I do.
Would you do it
for 15%, Alex?
So, guys,
before you jump...
Before you go...
I'll do it for 15%,
but that means
you can't listen to Mark.
Corcoran: Ooh.
O'Leary:
What are you going to do?
I would take Mr. Wonderful's
offer [Snaps fingers] like that.
Why give up all that equity?
Rodriguez: Just to be clear,
Cole and Emily,
I'm investing $200,000
as a convertible note,
which means if you don't hit
the 1.8 in sales,
it would stay as debt
on the business.
Okay.
Okay?
Got it.
Um, would there be, um,
options for P. O. financing
and lines of credit
on top of the $200,000?
I would consider that, yes.
Okay.
