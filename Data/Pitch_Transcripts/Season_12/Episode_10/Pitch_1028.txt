I'm Chrissie Lam,
founder of Love Is Project.
I'm here today
seeking $250,000
for 5% of my company.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Gladys Lam,
Chrissie's loving mom.
Chrissie, how did you
come up with this idea?
My background,
I worked in corporate fashion
It's very inspirational,
Chrissie.
Wow.
But is there ?? is there
a profit motivation in this,
or are you trying to sustain
these 2,000?plus jobs?
No, the idea is we're
creating jobs for the women
so they can support
their families.
Our profit margin blended
is 70%.
Our EBITDA is 30%.
What does
one bracelet cost,
Gladys, I love your fingers.
What are you doing there?
I'd love to answer
Mark's questions.
Fire away, Gladys.
Right? Chrissie, you're
obviously very accomplished.
You've had professional success.
Rodriguez:
Gladys, I got to tell you,
you remind me of my mother.
[ Cuban laughs ]
But in a good way.
My mother arrived
to this country
in the late 1960s,
Chrissie:
We're disappointed
we didn't make a deal
with the Sharks today,
but, you know, it doesn't matter
because we're still passionate
about our project.
We're going to be
profitable,
