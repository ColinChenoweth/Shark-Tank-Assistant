I'm Chrissie Lam,
founder of Love Is Project.
I'm here today
seeking $250,000
for 5% of my company.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Gladys Lam,
Chrissie's loving mom.
I help her with finance
and operations
for the Love Is Project.
What does the world
need more of now?
Love!             Love!
And that's why I started
the Love Is Project ??
to focus on spreading
more positivity,
empathy, and connection.
Our flagship
Love Is Project product
is our artisan?made
love bracelets,
which remind you to love
and be loved.
Every handmade bracelet
is inspired by the culture
and craftsmanship
of each place of origin.
We've been able to create
over 2,000 jobs
for female artisans
in 10 countries.
Chrissie, how did you
come up with this idea?
My background,
I worked in corporate fashion
doing concept design
and trend forecasting,
traveling around the world
for multibillion?dollar
fashion companies.
After I left corporate,
I spent another eight years
on the ground
working in developing countries
with artisan groups,
leading sourcing trips
and creating products.
While living in Kenya,
I created
the first Love Bracelet
with the Maasai tribe.
Rodriguez: When did you
start the business?
I started the project
in January 2017.
By year end, we'll have made
$4 million since launch.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?And this year,
it will reach
$2 million at the year end.
Good for you.
Wow.
What makes me most happy
is really to see the impact
that we've had
on the women's lives,
you know, seeing them able
to improve their homes
or send their kids to school
or feed their families.
We're more
than just a bracelet.
It's very inspirational,
Chrissie.
Wow.
But is there ?? is there
a profit motivation in this,
or are you trying to sustain
these 2,000?plus jobs?
No, the idea is we're
creating jobs for the women
so they can support
their families.
Our profit margin blended
is 70%.
Our EBITDA is 30%.
What does
one bracelet cost,
and what do you
sell it for?
So, we have
our Hero products.
The landed cost
is normally $3 to $5.
And that's for one
of the little bracelets?
The beaded bracelet.
Yeah, the beaded ones.
And then we sell those
between $18 and $30.
And where are you
selling them at?
We sell them online,
on our store.
Just on your website?
Oh, we're also in over
350 retailers in 44 states
in the United States
and 22 countries.
I like your messaging.
I think it's important.
But how do they find out
about your story?
What's telling them?
Cuban: Yeah, how are you
driving traffic?
Right.
We have digital marketing.
How much are you spending
per month
on that
digital advertising?
Gladys, I love your fingers.
What are you doing there?
I'd love to answer
Mark's questions.
Fire away, Gladys.
When we started,
both Chrissie and I,
we both don't have
any digital marketing skill.
I'm a bean counter, okay?
[ Laughter ]
So first year,
the Facebook ad kills us,
but we went to classes.
I am a dinosaur in the class,
the oldest lady there,
but we just
keep on cranking.
So the first year,
we might have spent
about 80% of our revenue
to Facebook.
Wow.
Rodriguez: Wow.
That's okay.
I'll take it.
I'm paying my tuition.
I'm going to learn it.
Amen.
Then 2019,
it's about 50%,
and now I'm down to 30%.
Including agency fees.
And it has every reason
to go further down
because she has
50,000 followers.
What's your cost
per individual sale?
My cost per acquisition.
Right.
CPA,
cost per acquisition.
Or POAS, right?
We're keeping it down
to around $25.
But our average order
is $75
because people are buying
for a gift.
And our long?term value
of for customers ??
Can you believe it?
You want to give a guess?
What is my top customers?
They spend...?
$300?
$1,200.
$4 million.
[ Laughter ]
Oh!
I love Barbara.
She has an angle.
Kevin, this is your
dream company.
For wedding gifts,
they buy to give to the guests
to share
the love messages.
Ah, yes.
Each one has
a different message.
Our top wedding party
is $5,000.
?Wow.
?Wow.
But I want to know a little bit.
You said bean counter.
I want to know a little bit more
about your background.
Chrissie and Gladys, I think
you're both full of yourselves.
You came in here saying
that you had a company
with a mission.
I don't see it that way at all.
I see it as a mission, period.
But you don't take care
of the business end.
See, I don't agree
with that, Barb.
Really?
I don't agree
with that at all.
Yeah.
Well, then maybe
Mark will invest.
I totally mistrust your capacity
to make a profit.
And now you ??
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
And now you come in here,
and you're asking
for an investment in a business
that had a loss last year.
It's the equivalent of you
coming in and asking us
for a charity donation.
Maybe you have something
to convince me otherwise.
I'd like to hear it.
Yes, we've been able
to get unsolicited
celebrity endorsements,
international press,
and secure
big brand partnerships.
Yeah, but it's got to
at some point translate
to the bottom line,
and it hasn't.
It is happening.
It will this year.
But most entrepreneurs
always believe
it might happen
the next year.
I'm afraid I could never
think of investing in it.
We can show that.
So for that reason, I'm out.
You've done a great job
in articulating the mission.
I get that.
My mother taught me that
if you're successful in life,
you have to give back.
So far this year,
I'm at 35 charities
that I've supported,
and the only reason I can
is that the majority
of my investments make money.
And I take that,
and I give back.
I'm confused
with this presentation.
Am I investing in a business,
or am I investing in a mission?
This is not the Charity Tank.
This is the Shark Tank.
I'm a Shark. I want to invest,
and I want to make money.
Then I'll take my profits
and do whatever I like with it.
I don't feel there's a place
for me in this.
I'm out.
You are great people,
and it's a great product.
But on the other hand,
there's just too much
competition in this space.
We have ??
I'll support,
but I just can't invest.
We ??
I'm out.
Look, I?I ?? it is a business,
and the mission is great.
The questions I have are
in just some of the particulars.
Right? Chrissie, you're
obviously very accomplished.
You've had professional success.
And, Gladys,
you're just a home run hitter.
That's my disconnect.
Because why are you here?
That is an absolute
disconnect to me
that I have a huge problem with.
And for those reasons, I'm out.
Rodriguez:
Gladys, I got to tell you,
you remind me of my mother.
[ Cuban laughs ]
But in a good way.
My mother arrived
to this country
in the late 1960s,
and she worked for 25 years
as a single mother
to support my brother
and my sister and I.
And I love it.
But I think you're stuck
in the middle of the bridge
between philanthropic
and business.
And when I invest in businesses,
I like to go narrow and deep.
Chrissie:
We're disappointed
we didn't make a deal
with the Sharks today,
but, you know, it doesn't matter
because we're still passionate
about our project.
We're going to be
profitable,
and we will keep
the profits.
We don't have to share
with the Sharks.
[ Laughs ]
Mom, no.
