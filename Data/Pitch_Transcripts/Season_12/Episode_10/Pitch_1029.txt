My name is Mabel Frias.
And I am Shaira Frias.
And we are...
Together: The Frias sisters!
And the co?founders
of Luna Magic.
Luna Magic is beauty
with a Latina vibe.
We provide high quality
cosmetics all at great prices.
And we're all about
the three B's ??
Bueno, bonito, y barato.
Bueno, which
means great quality.
All of our formulas
are long lasting
with minimal
product fallout.
Bonito,
which means beautiful.
We have beautiful
packaging.
Y barato, which means
great prices.
Our customers
shouldn't have to choose.
No, no, no.
She deserves to buy it all.
As beauty customers,
we struggled
to find brands
that spoke to us
or showed Latinas
of our skin tone
in their marketing.
But guess what? Being Latina
is not a seasonal thing.
We're Latinas 365 days a year,
rain or shine.
That's right, sister,
and Luna Magic celebrates
our cultura, our culture,
in every way,
as evidenced, for example,
in our creative color names,
like salud, dinero,
y amor.
Reggaeton, banda,
salsa.
Mamacita, papi, y bebé.
Y oro, plata, diamante.
'Cause if
we ain't blingin'...
We ain't livin'!
So, listen up, Sharks.
We are seeking $200,000
for 10% of Luna Magic.
Yeah, and as a special bonus,
Sharks ?? [Speaks Spanish] ??
we will throw in
some complementary
Spanish lessons or...
Some salsa classes.
Because...
Sí se puede!
So, who wants in?!
[ Laughter ]
Great job.
Cuban: Good job.
As you can see,
we're very vibrant in colors.
But what I'm really
most excited about
for you to really touch and feel
is our formulations.
You have our
Uno eye shadow palette,
which is our
first collection,
designed by my beautiful
baby sister.
Mabel, are these
individual products,
or is this a package
that you sell?
Individual. Yes.
Individual products, yes.
Tell us where you're from.
Yeah, so we are from
Washington Heights,
from New York City.
Our parents are from
the Dominican Republic.
We're the first women
in our family to go to college.
So, I was the first one.
I ended up going to NYU.
Good for you.
And then I went to
Parsons Design School
for my master's.
Santo Domingo.
Oh, wow.
And my mother, Santiago.
[ Laughter ]
Um, so, you know,
we essentially took
parallel career paths.
I went off to corporate America,
and my sister went off
to journalism school
and then makeup school.
So she's the queen
behind all the formulations.
How much have you sold?
So to date, we have sold $16,000
of product sales.
Ouch.
But as a company,
we've generated income of
$103,000 across three ways.
Again, $16,000
in product sales,
$30,000 as a grant,
and then $57,000
through a marketing partnership.
Tell us what that is.
Yeah, so basically,
we partnered with
a subscription box company
in which we developed
our brushes,
300,000 units to go out
to that
particular customer base.
So you sold to them
your brushes that they included
in a subscription package?
Correct.
And to be honest with you,
the way that those partnerships
are generally
structured,
you're not necessarily
supposed to make money
because it's marketing.
Right, no,
that's why I'm asking.
Right? Yeah.
Exactly.
So my beautiful
baby sister,
who I call
Señorita Wonderful ??
Señorita Wonderful!
Wait a minute.
Much better than
Mr. Wonderful.
Yes!
I smell a royalty.
Yeah!
So Señorita Wonderful
did a fantastic job
of sourcing the factory
and also really negotiating
for every penny for us
to generate
a little bit of income.
Good for you guys, yeah.
The part that my sister
missed is
the purchase order
was $498,000.
Wow.
The value of
that purchase order.
Cuban: Now we're getting ??
Yeah.
From who?
So we're talking
about the brushes.
We presented the brushes
to the subscription box.
Okay. They supplied it directly.
Exactly.
And after all that crossover,
you had $57,000 in profits?
Correct.
Yes.
This is probably one
of your top sellers, right?
Yes.                Yes.
And I would recommend for you
to swatch the green one.
It's called dinero.
[ Laughs ]
So if I just
go on to your site,
what does this cost me?
It's $26 retail.
And what does
it cost you?
$3.40 landed.
Okay, so those
are great margins,
which is why
this industry is so competitive.
But it's a giant task
to acquire customers.
So I'm happy to announce
that although we've only had
$16,000 of product sales
this year,
next year, we're projected
to generate
$1.1 million...
How?
...because
we're going into Walmart.
Wow.
Oh, you're going into
Walmart in retail?
?Fortune one.
?Yes.
How many Walmart stores?
So we have two programs
that we're working towards.
Our first program is
1,538 stores.
Our opening ??
That's half a roll out.
And the second one...
And the second one ??
...is the testing
for the end caps.
When you say testing for
the end caps, what do you mean?
So basically, we're doing
a six weeks' test
of our
capsule collection.
What's on the table right now is
between 350 and 800 doors.
Now, how did you get
through to them?
Who is your logistics partner
going to be
for this deal?
Because I have lots of companies
that sell Walmart.
Barbara seems interested
in Shaira and Mabel's
cosmetic brand for Latinas,
Luna Magic,
but she is hesitant.
Do I really want to do that?
[ Chuckles ]
Hmm.
While she's thinking,
I am impressed
by everything you've done,
and I know how hard it is
to do cosmetics.
But I am invested
in something else
that is a cosmetic line,
and I don't want
to be a conflict.
So I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you.
I mentioned you were
slightly messy
in your explanations
on the finance.
That worries me.
But I'm the most organized
person I've ever met,
so I can help you with that,
get your house in order
with great clarity, okay?
So I'm going to offer you
a greedy offer,
but it's up to you.
I'll give you the $250,000
in the form of only a credit
line to fund your orders
'cause you're going to need
$250,000, not $200,000.
And I want 30% for that.
I actually think that
makes sense for you,
because you ?? you are in the
eye of a hurricane right now.
I have companies
that are struggling
with a third of the exposure
you have to Walmart,
just trying to keep up.
Well, let's actually
talk about what other
additional things we've been
doing to market ourselves.
I'd love to hear a response
to my offer first.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
I think it's the only offer,
by the way.
Okay.
Does it include
the potential opportunity
of future P. O. financing
as we grow and prove ourself
through in the business?
No problem at all.
I never mind funding
any of my partners,
as long as the orders
are there.
You get 30%
no matter what?
Oh, I get 30% on Day 1.
[ Whispers indistinctly ]
Okay, can we counter?
I know it's the only offer,
but if we weren't
entrepreneurial ??
Be careful.
Corcoran:
No, I'll tell you why.
I've walked down the path
with the big box stores
with many, many products.
Okay.
And Mr. Wonderful
for once is right.
It's a hellhole.
Okay.
You have to know who to talk to,
when to pull back.
It's so complicated.
It's a royal
pain in the neck, okay?
No, it's a ?? it's a lot of
work on my part.
Okay. Okay.
I think you have to make
a decision.
You guys are owners.
Yes.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Barbara, you have a deal.
You got it.
Cuban: Congrats, guys.
Greiner: Congrats, guys.
And you have yourself
a great partner, by the way.
Thank you.
You will. You guys are
going to crush with Barbara.
She'll be great.
Hasta luego.
Bye!
Mabel: You know,
we underestimated
how difficult
the Shark Tank is,
but we're very grateful
that we walked away with a deal.
I mean, obviously,
the word "messy"
was a little bit
of an ouch.
[ Both laugh ]
But, um, since
we're entrepreneurs
and we don't take
things personal
and the fact
that she invested
is going to help us
clean it up.
That is going to be hard work.
The biggest danger
to both of them
is they have stars
in their eyes
because they hear
the name Walmart.
[ Gasps ] Walmart wants us.
I know.
Look, when they came in here,
I thought they were
selling pizza.
[ Laughter ]
