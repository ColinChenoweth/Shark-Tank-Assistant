My name is Mabel Frias.
Together: The Frias sisters!
Mabel, are these
individual products,
or is this a package
that you sell?
Individual. Yes.
Individual products, yes.
Tell us where you're from.
Yeah, so we are from
Washington Heights,
from New York City.
Our parents are from
the Dominican Republic.
We're the first women
in our family to go to college.
So, I was the first one.
I ended up going to NYU.
Mabel: You know,
we underestimated
how difficult
the Shark Tank is,
but we're very grateful
that we walked away with a deal.
I mean, obviously,
the word "messy"
was a little bit
of an ouch.
[ Both laugh ]
But, um, since
we're entrepreneurs
