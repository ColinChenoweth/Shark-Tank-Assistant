Our supporters resonate with our
strong brand message of love.
They appreciate
our authenticity,
our accessibility,
and social impact.
Love is the common thread
that connects us all.
It's universal, so come
spread the love with us.
Have everyone wear
their heart on their wrist.
We've got so much love
to give.
The gifts in front of you
are our way
of sharing
our love with you.
Corcoran: Yeah.
I came from a strong
lineage of women.
My mom escaped
the communist China
and went to Hong Kong
to look for a better future.
I too immigrated to America
as a student
looking for
my American dream.
Then I quickly got
my CPA.
I rose up through the ranks
to be a VP finance.
Wow.
Which company?
Bank of America.
Bank of America?
Yes.
Good for you.
I want to be a little more
focused here for a second, okay?
I'm the numbers guy here.
You're the bean counter.
Yes.
You said that yourself.
What did you sell last year,
and what did you make on it?
Last year, we sell
a million and one.
And what did you net
on that?
That year, we still ??
our Facebook ads
are still
very expensive.
Is that another way of saying
you made no money?
Yes.
Could you just tell me
what you lost last year,
what the number was?
Close to $80,000
in loss.
Okay, so we have
established
that the business
lost $80,000 last year.
That's not good.
And you have no debt.
We have ??
I have
a small business loan.
How much?
$200,000.
Oh.
Cuban: Is that an EIDL?
Wow.
So that's where
the $200,000 ??
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Okay, so $200,000.
Just a standard SBA loan.
Yes.
Okay, plus you have
an EIDL for of how much?
Yes.
$382,000.
$382,000. Wait, wait, wait.
$382,000?
So that means you have
$582,000 in debt
on the company right now.
It feels like you guys
are wide and shallow.
So I will support your mission,
but I will do it as a customer,
not as an investor.
And I wish you the very best.
For those reasons, I'm out.
All right.
O'Leary: Okay, guys.
Thank you very much,
everyone.
Cuban: Sorry, guys.
Congratulations on what
you've accomplished, though.
Thank you.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Really?
It is ?? It is a challenge
to keep up with
their logistics
because you're going to
a thousand stores.
Quite frankly, uh,
we're vetting suppliers,
but that's why we're here.
We're here for help.
How much money have you raised
or put into it yourself?
We've invested $250,000...
Oh!
Rodriguez: Wow.
...of our own savings.
How'd you save so much money?
We've been working
since we were ??
were 14 years old.
Hustlin'.
Good for you guys.
As soon as we ??
Yes.
Yeah.
That is incredible.
Greiner:
I am beyond impressed.
Unbelievable.
Let's talk
about the Walmart box.
It retails for $5.
We decided to give them
the $26 eye shadow palette
in their Walmart box.
We gave them 10,000.
So it was
a $30,000 investment.
What we had intentionally
decided is,
"Hey, we will give you this
as an investment,
as a marketing cost
for us.
In exchange,
let us in the program."
Then they give you
over a thousand stores?
We got 4.8 stars of
customers saying,
"We love this product,
we're so excited."
Because of Latina.
And that's what convinced them
to give you
a thousand?plus stores?
Correct.
Exactly.
Do you have to pay
for the end cap position?
Yes.
We're paying for the end cap.
How much are you paying?
$65,000.
Against an order of what
for the end cap?
The total order
will be $360,000,
minus $65,000,
minus the cost of the product,
which is about
$200,000.
How much cash do you guys
have in the bank right now?
$157,000.
Okay, let's take
a step back here.
'Cause you guys
are all in on this, right?
You have $157,000 left.
You just told us that
you were going to have to buy
$200,000 worth of product.
Correct.
Plus $65,000 for the end cap.
You don't have $265,000.
No.
Well, that's
why we're here.
[ Laughs ]
We're here for help!
Guys, in order to
get there, right,
it takes a lot.
Yes.
Not just financially,
but organizationally.
There's going to be
specific needs there
to fill in those gaps for you
that I think are
going to be challenging.
I just can't get there.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
In 12 years of "Shark Tank,"
I have never, ever seen
a company as
so early stage as yours
that has both an end cap order
and a 50% regional roll out
in Walmart.
You need a logistics partner
in a brutal way.
You're like the classic
you've gone out fishing
on a little boat
and you caught a whale,
and it's just dragging you
right down to the bottom
of the ocean.
That's a great analogy.
And you're hanging on.
You're hanging on.
You're trying to reel it in,
and it's saying,
"I'm going to eat these
two girls when I get down here."
I'm really impressed,
but boy, do you have
a nightmare ahead.
I'm out.
Thank you.      Thank you.
Anyone?
I love the story.
I love the hustle.
I love Dominican,
Washington Heights.
I like everything about it.
Unfortunately,
we're in the business.
Jen and I can't do it.
There's a conflict.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you, Alex.
Thank you. We understand.
What is your order
with Walmart?
$400,000 P. O. value if we're
looking at both programs.
Okay, $400,000.
You have how much
of that cash?
We have $150,000
in the bank.
So why are you here
only asking for $200,000?
Runs a little short.
Well, we were hoping that
in, you know,
talking to you Sharks,
we could find
maybe different ways,
meaning we're open
to a little bit of equity,
a little bit of
P. O. financing.
Line of credit.
You came in
asking for $200,000.
It's rare that the Sharks say,
"Let me give you more money."
Okay.
They usually say,
"Let me take more stock."
[ Chuckles ]
Are you open to taking
more equity?
Oh, I'm always open
to taking equity.
I love you guys,
but you confuse me.
I was sitting here. I rewrote
your numbers nine times.
The business is
a little bit of a mess,
probably more than I'm even
picking up right here.
But I like you,
and here's my offer.
So, I'm gonna give you
the $200,000.
Wait. Do I really
want to do that?
[ Chuckles ]
And I'm Brad.
And we're here
seeking $120,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company...
Together: Bubbly Blaster!
Oh, yeah!
[ Laughs ]
All right, Sharks, everybody
loves to have a good time.
And the international symbol
for celebration
is spraying champagne!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold up, big guy.
Ah.
Unless you just won
an NBA championship
or a World Series,
no one wants to waste
their bubbly all in one go
or have to clean up a huge mess
after it's all over.
That's why we've come up
with the Bubbly Blaster,
the only way to celebrate
with champagne that's more fun,
less mess, and guaranteed
to keep the party going longer.
All right, Sharks,
time for some fun.
Fast forward
two moments from now
when we've made
record breaking deals
with all five of you.
Jackpot!
Time to celebrate.
[ Cork pops ]
Whoo?hoo!
We designed the Bubbly Blaster
to easily fit
into any
champagne bottle,
turning it into a long
lasting champers cannon
to keep
the celebration going,
the bubbly fresh,
and the mess to a minimum.
Cuban: There you go!
Whoo?hoo!
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, check that out, Sharks!
Oh, my God. That would
have been so useful.
Our patented system
snaps into place
and is ready for
action immediately.
No need for shaking.
Oh, my God.
Our throttling trigger
is precise
for up?close action like that
or for up to 30 feet away
so you can keep the party going
even while social distancing.
That's right.
Oh, Mark, man,
wouldn't you love to have
one of these
next time you win
a world championship?
Right? And, Alex,
if you buy a team
and win a World Series,
can't you see yourself
in the locker room
with one of these bad boys?
Two of them, yeah, for sure.
[ Chuckles ]
All right, who's ready to be
the life of the party
and blast off
with the Bubbly Blaster?
[ Laughter ]
Let's go.
Whoo!
All right, Sharks,
time to have some fun.
I'm going to walk you
through attaching
your Bubbly Blaster
to the champagne bottle
in front of you.
Step 1, rotate the handle
to open like this.
Yep, there you go.
You got it.
Now slide the nozzle
into the open bottle like so.
Now, you want to
snap it down,
and there's going to be
some resistance
because you want to make
a strong seal.
Step 4 is you flip
the whole thing upside down.
Now, remember, Sharks,
please drink responsibly.
Ooh, hell yeah!
The handle ?? Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Oh!
Oh, there it goes.
[ Laughs ]
[ Gasps ] Shoot!
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]
And then I met Brad, who just
got his MBA at the time.
We teamed up.
And they're being manufactured
now just outside of Hong Kong.
So what does one cost, and what
does it cost you to make?
Sale price is $99.99,
with a landed cost of $18.50.
What?! [ Laughs ]
Seriously?
It's $18.50 landed,
you sell it for 100 bucks?
?Yep
?Yeah.
Wow.
And how many have you sold?
Greiner: Oh, my God.
Since our launch last year,
we've sold $560,000.
Wow.
We sell directly from
our website and Amazon.
Cuban: All right,
guys, guys, look.
All you're selling is fun.
There's no real utility.
Oh, you know what?
I buy this
$500 bottle of champagne,
and I wanted
to drink it out of a gun.
It's more of a fun item.
Rodriguez: But, Mark,
every championship team
has to have that.
Oh, yeah. Hell yeah.
I wish we had that in '09
when we won the championship.
Yeah!
So I love it.
How much, first of all, how much
do you own of the business?
How much money have you raised?
We're 50/50 partners.
We both ?? In total
contributions,
$120,000.
$60,000 each.
And we've been bootstrapping
since Day 1, so...
No debt?
Yeah.
No debt.
No debt.
Corcoran: So tell me,
what would you use
the money for?
We want to put that money to
elevating and enhancing
our ad spend, you know,
kind of let it ??
you know, put the fuel
on the fire,
and additional inventory
because we ran into that
situation in our launch year
where they sold out
way too quickly.
So what's your vision
for this?
There's the whole channel
of the business to business.
So we had a lot of interest
from, you know, bars,
hotels, restaurants,
the pool parties,
things like that.
But why wouldn't you just
stay direct to consumers?
COVID kind of hurt
because people couldn't go out
and party as much, right?
Yeah.
So even, like, event companies
and hotels, right...
Caterers.
...let them just buy from you
because it's 99 bucks, right?
They have, a little bit.
Yeah, you don't need
to have a wholesaler.
You don't need to go
to a retailer.
The bigger question is,
can you get your price down
even lower than $18.50?
We could.
With higher volume,
for sure.
What do your volumes
need to be?
I mean, we usually do it
in 5,000?unit increments now.
So, how much does it go down
if you go to 25,000?
I mean, 25,000,
probably closer to 10.
I got to tell
you guys something.
You came in here
with $120,000 for 20%.
Imputes a $600,000 valuation.
That's not crazy.
You might get a deal.
You might get a deal.
Actually, you know what?
You guys <i>will</i> get a deal.
I'll offer you
the $120,000 for 25%.
Just got to tell me,
and if not, I'll go out.
That's a no?brainer.
Done?
Ye?? Bu??
Yeah.
I'd love to get
you guys together.
Yes.
You guys did that
with Ice Shaker.
I think it'd be
a no?brainer.
But then you got to
give us 30%.
Oh.
Could you do, uh,
$180,000 for 30%?
Yeah, we can do that.
Yeah, let's do that.
Done.
Yes!
We got a deal!
That was easy.
Greiner: All right!
Whoo!
?Jackpot!
?Whoo?hoo!
Oh!
?Yeah!
?Congratulations, guys.
It's gonna be fun.
Cheers, Sharks. Thank you.
Bye, dudes.
Adios!
Whoo?hoo! Yeah!
Jackpot!
Yes!
Blastin' off!
Hustlin' and battlin', baby!
Whoo?hoo!
Bam, bam, bam.
Well, here,
cheers to your deal.
Cheers.
Chevalier du Tastevin.
Chevrolet.
