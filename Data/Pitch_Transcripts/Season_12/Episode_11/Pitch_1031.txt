Hi, Sharks.
I'm Nick Hamburger.
I'm Zack Schreier.
We're here
from Chicago, Illinois,
seeking $200,000
in exchange for 5% "egguity"
in our venture Quevos.
Sharks, sometimes it's
the snacks we love dearly
that hurt us the most.
When people realize that their
favorite snacks aren't healthy,
they often experience
the five stages of grief.
I revisited the idea,
called Nick up,
What does Zack do
all day long?
When we really got going
our sophomore year of college,
I took one year off
of Williams College
to basically get this product
from concept
to finished,
shelf?ready products.
Yeah.
Nick, how much money
have you raised?
$1.6 million to date.
Wow.
Zack, I think you guys
probably two of the youngest,
most impressive people
we've ever had out here.
But I don't like the taste.
I know you're
gonna do well.
It's just not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you so much, Robert.
No worries.
O'Leary: I love this deal.
I mean, the story ??
the innovation
from the fried eggs,
I love that.
You're not loving the pricing.
I mean ??
No, I don't.
I tell you what.
I'd structure
a little differently.
In this case, I would
do this deal for $200,000
Hamburger: Thank you.
Like, I'm just sitting here.
It's a pleasure
watching you guys.
He wants the nickel.
?[ Chuckles ]
?So...
Kevin, thank you
for your offer.
That may be your worst offer
in 12 years.
[ Laughter ]
It really might.
Kevin loves the misery.
You know, I'm in
a different place in life.
?I like happy.
?You look happy.
I think you go national,
you may get big numbers quicker,
but it's going to crush you.
So for me,
the road is a little longer.
I think you have
such a unique product,
you can create
the pull through...
Yeah.
...maybe a little bit
along the road.
Are you giving an offer?
?So my offer...
?You want 6 cents a can.
[ Cuban laughs ]
I'll give you $150,000
for 12%.
?Okay.
?Wow! Do that.
?So...
?What do you want to do?
Yeah, so the royalty
is an interesting deal.
Kevin, we thought
you might say that.
[ Laughter ]
However, it feels like not
the most efficient way
