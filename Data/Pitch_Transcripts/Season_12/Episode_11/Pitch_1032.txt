Hi, Sharks.
I'm Nick Hamburger.
I'm Zack Schreier.
We're here
from Chicago, Illinois,
seeking $200,000
in exchange for 5% "egguity"
in our venture Quevos.
Sharks, sometimes it's
the snacks we love dearly
that hurt us the most.
When people realize that their
favorite snacks aren't healthy,
they often experience
the five stages of grief.
First, we see denial, where
we just can't handle the truth.
Potato chips
are veggies, right?
[ Laughs ]
Then comes anger.
Empty calories!
White flour!
After that,
there's bargaining,
where we hold on
to false hope.
Blue corn
tortilla chips?
I mean, come on, these ?? these
have got to be healthier
than yellow corn
tortilla chips, right?
Fourth,
we see depression.
What's the point of snacking
when you always get hurt?
[ Laughter ]
And finally, Sharks,
we see acceptance.
We make peace
with the fact
that our favorite snacks
will never be healthy for us.
Now, Sharks,
that's where we come in.
We've created
<i>the</i> healthy snack
to save people from
this vicious snacking cycle.
Quevos!           Quevos!
Quevos are the world's
first?ever chips
made from egg whites.
This is the snack that's both
delicious and healthy.
Wow.
Quevos are packed
with eight grams of protein
and four grams of fiber
in every serving.
And our keto flavors only have
four net carbs per bag.
The days of starchy, fried,
and processed snacks
made from potatoes and tortillas
are done.
Now, Sharks,
who's "eggcited"
to crack out of their shell
with Quevos?
Who wants to try
some samples?
Love to.
Tell us what we have.
Cuban: Absolutely.
So here we have
our two classic flavors,
cheddar
and sweet barbecue,
and then two
of our keto flavors,
sour cream and onion
and dill pickle.
Taste good.
We have over 500
five?star reviews on Amazon
out of 800 reviews.
I love them.
Oh, so glad to hear that.
That's awesome.
Tasty and light.
Yeah, I really do.
They have the same amount
of calories as normal chips.
Exactly.
But much more volume.
It's better
than a typical snack.
With all that fiber
and protein,
you walk away from each bag
feeling much more satisfied.
How long ago
did you launch this?
Yeah, so we launched this
in 2018.
We did a Kickstarter.
We raised $72,000...
Wow.
...and started launching
retail later that year.
And what did you sell
last year?
$260,000 in sales
last year.
Wow. Wow.
This year we've done $660,000
through the first seven months,
on pace
for $1.3 million.
And what percentage is online?
Just use this year.
So 80% of our sales
are online,
20% in retail,
where we're in 400 stores.
Tell me what it costs you
to make one bag like this
and what you sell them for.
Sure, so it costs us 83 cents
to make a bag.
We sell to distributors
for $1.50,
online for $2.50 to $3.
And then the price that we see
at the end of the day
after referral fees
are $2.49.
That's also the MSRP.
The process is all automated
now with a co?packer?
We manufacture ourselves,
actually.
We have a unique process,
and so we kind of had to
scale it ourselves.
We talk to co?packers,
and we will continue
to speak with them as we grow.
But so far, the quotes
they've given us
have been
up to two times our cost.
How do you make it?
So we can tell you
it's not fried.
That's the most
important part,
but it is a proprietary
and novel process.
So we can't disclose
the details.
It's baked, right?
It's not.
I'm just wondering
how two chicken dudes
figured this out.
Greiner: It's not?
I guess it all started
10 years ago.
So, I was diagnosed
with type 1 diabetes,
and I went from being a kid
who loved to snack all the time,
didn't think about it,
to being somebody
that had to watch every single
carb I put into my body.
And I realized one day
those crispy pieces of egg white
that coated the pan
when I made an omelet,
they crunched
kind of like chips.
I thought, "Hey, maybe I can
make a chip out of this."
And that took myself ??
That's a great call
right there,
'cause that crunchy stuff
is good.
Fast?forward about eight years,
as we're going to college.
I revisited the idea,
called Nick up,
and we got to work on it.
I am the CEO.
We have seven full time
on production.
What does Zack do
all day long?
When we really got going
our sophomore year of college,
I took one year off
of Williams College
to basically get this product
from concept
to finished,
shelf?ready products.
Now, Nick and I
talk about strategy.
I sit on the board.
But you have
a different job.
I'm back at
Williams College now.
Are you guys both
out of college?
Or one's in, one's out?
Yeah, so after
my sophomore year,
I dropped out
of University of Chicago.
And so now I've had
two years full time on
this business, and ??
You haven't even
finished college yet?
Yeah.
How old are you guys?
Herjavec: Wow.
22.
?22?
?You're kidding?
Yeah.
Nick, how much money
have you raised?
$1.6 million to date.
Wow.
Who did you raise that from
and for how much?
Kraft Heinz invested
a little bit.
Come on.
Yeah.
How did you get
introduced to them?
We were in their
incubator program.
We were actually
the only pre?revenue brand
ever accepted
to their incubator.
You two
are two impressive...
Lubetzky: Very much
...guys.
Zack and Nick, 83 cents
cost of production per bag
is pretty high.
What's your ideal price point
that you're targeting?
At the end of the day,
$1.99 a bag
we think would be
the lowest we need to go.
Well, you're definitely smart
to start higher,
because once you start low,
you can never go up.
But if you start high,
you can always go down.
Exactly.
So who came up
with the name?
We were thinking of "eggs"
in other languages.
We thought of "huevos,"
and then someone's like,
"Well, they're quick huevos.
They're eggs on the go."
And so we combined
"quick" and "huevos."
So it's Spanglish.
Yeah, it's cute.
What about marketing?
How much have you guys been
spending on marketing and where?
So online we usually spend about
$20,000 a month on marketing.
Last month,
we did $90,000 online sales.
So we're seeing
a good return.
Zack, I think you guys
probably two of the youngest,
most impressive people
we've ever had out here.
But I don't like the taste.
I know you're
gonna do well.
It's just not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you so much, Robert.
No worries.
O'Leary: I love this deal.
I mean, the story ??
the innovation
from the fried eggs,
I love that.
You're not loving the pricing.
I mean ??
No, I don't.
I tell you what.
I'd structure
a little differently.
In this case, I would
do this deal for $200,000
and I'd put a royalty
of 10 cents a bag
until I get back $400,000.
Wait, wait,
wait for it.
But I would only take
2.5% equity.
So I get to participate.
You get into the "Shark Tank"
Dome of Desire, as I call it.
I would help you
on digital like crazy.
I would prefer to sell this
direct to customer
than through Amazon.
Work together with my companies
to go direct.
We are killing it direct.
Lubetzky: What's your vision?
What do you ??
What would be success
for you?
Yeah, our hope
is to sell the company
on a three?
to five?year timeline.
Why?
We've seen in this space,
it can be perilous to hang on to
your brand the bigger it grows,
because the big guys
will at some point
either want to buy you
or knock you off.
I actually don't blame you
for having a very
well?thought?through answer.
But the problem
that Mr. Wonderful mentioned
is a serious one.
5% is very hard to justify.
The valuation's
pretty crazy.
We came into the Tank
hoping not to give away
too much equity
at this stage.
But, you know,
it's worth it
to give more than 5%
to have you on board.
We'd be willing
to come up to 10%.
Even for more cash,
you wouldn't go to 15%, 20%?
We could consider
an offer,
but, you know, our goal was
to minimize the dilution.
At the same time, we really want
you involved and want you ??
You know,
if a Shark gets involved,
we want them to be motivated
and really bought in, so...
Herjavec:
You guys are so solid.
Greiner: I know.
Hamburger: Thank you.
Like, I'm just sitting here.
It's a pleasure
watching you guys.
Lubetzky: Zack and Nick,
I'm going to make you an offer.
I'll do $200,000 for 10%.
Thank you so much
for the offer.
Would you mind if Nick and I
talked about it for a minute?
I don't mind.
Don't forget the other offer.
Does anyone else ??
Would anyone else like to ??
Greiner: And listen,
I will tell you something.
I'm already your customer.
Awesome.
I love it.
I think Daniel's
a perfect partner for you.
I don't.
I think Mr. Wonderful is.
[ Laughs ] I think Daniel's
a perfect partner for you.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you so much, Lori.
Thank you, Lori.
But we haven't heard
from Mr. Cuban.
Cuban: So the question I have
is, what comes next?
Exit is great, right?
My whole goal when I started was
to retire by the time I was 35,
because the one thing
you can never buy is time.
Right?
So I don't mind that at all.
But I have a feeling that
you guys have more on your mind
in terms of breadth
of product line
in order to make this a brand,
like Daniel's alluding to.
So that's what I'd like
to hear.
I think we view egg whites
as really the cornerstone
of the brand.
They let us make things
that are crunchy,
delicious,
high in protein.
What else can you make
with egg whites?
Quite a lot, so you can
make puffs, protein cookies.
Guys, you wanted to go talk.
I just want to tell you,
I can't do less than 10%.
That's my floor number, so...
And I'll make it easier
for you guys.
I think you don't have
that one slam?dunk thing,
so you always have to
get people to sample.
That's gonna be
a challenge.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Well, thank you, Mark.
Okay, thank you, Mark.
You still have
two fantastic offers.
I really like Mr. Wonderful's.
He's a great guy.
And the Kraft Heinz guys
love me.
Just want you to know that.
Good to know.
You have two offers.
What are you gonna do?
But Zack and Nick have
two offers on the table
for their egg?white chips,
Quevos.
You have two offers.
What are you gonna do?
So we'd love to counter
to Daniel first
just because of all
of your experience with KIND.
And so we're gonna counter
with 300K
and a line of credit
for that 10% stake.
Herjavec:
How much of a line of credit?
Maybe a $200,000 line of credit
or purchase?order funding.
Can you go up
on the percentage equity?
We'd prefer to come down on the
cash to $250,000 in that case.
Here's what I'll do.
I'll give you
$200,000 investment
and a $200,000 line of credit
for a 10% stake.
He wants the nickel.
?[ Chuckles ]
?So...
Kevin, thank you
for your offer.
That may be your worst offer
in 12 years.
[ Laughter ]
It really might.
Kevin loves the misery.
You know, I'm in
a different place in life.
?I like happy.
?You look happy.
I think you go national,
you may get big numbers quicker,
but it's going to crush you.
So for me,
the road is a little longer.
I think you have
such a unique product,
you can create
the pull through...
Yeah.
...maybe a little bit
along the road.
Are you giving an offer?
?So my offer...
?You want 6 cents a can.
[ Cuban laughs ]
I'll give you $150,000
for 12%.
?Okay.
?Wow! Do that.
?So...
?What do you want to do?
Yeah, so the royalty
is an interesting deal.
Kevin, we thought
you might say that.
[ Laughter ]
However, it feels like not
the most efficient way
to use our margin.
But you understand the problem.
I don't have a royalty deal.
That's why I'm coming
back to you, Robert.
Love your offer.
What would you think about
$200,000 for 10%?
I would do $200,000 for 15%.
[ Breathes deeply ]
Okay, um...
[ Cuban laughs ]
O'Leary:
It reflects the risk.
Would you do
$200,000 for 12%?
If so, we got a deal.
I'll do $200,000 for 15%.
?Now you got me excited.
?Robert!
?15%! 15%!
?Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
?He said 15%!
?He said 15%!
[ Laughter ]
?15%?
?Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
