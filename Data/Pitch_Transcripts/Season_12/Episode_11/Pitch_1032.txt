Hi, Sharks.
I'm Kweku Larbi.
I'm about to introduce you
to the most revolutionary,
most innovative coffee maker
that will change
the game entirely.
Are you guys ready for this?
Herjavec: Yes.
Here it is!
Greiner: Oh. [ Laughs ]
Ohh!
Whoo!
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my gosh!
You think that piece of junk is
gonna change the game of coffee?
You're crazy!
You're probably wondering,
who's this guy
who's been sitting in
a coffee cup for the last hour?
My name's Ross Smith.
I'm a social media influencer.
I have over 45 million followers
across all platforms.
Our friend Kweku created
a solution that was so good
that I had to
partner up with them.
Ross, can you please get me
a coffee pod from that tent?
Huh.
Oh, man.
What the heck, Kweku?!
Yeah, Ross, that's
1,000 coffee pods.
That's the amount the average
American will use this year
when they use single?serve
plastic pods.
Bro, this is so wasteful.
It's absolutely wasteful.
It's why at Brumachen, we didn't
stop at one innovation.
We went beyond.
We created this.
It's a biodegradable
single?serve coffee pod
Kweku, are you or your parents
from Ghana?
Yes.
Were you born
on Wednesday?
Yeah. How does he
know this stuff?
Wow.
Magician right there.
That's crazy.
People from the Asante tribe,
they name their children
based on the day of the week
that they're born.
Exactly.
So, guys, your coffee pod,
you twist the top off,
70% gross margins
at scale.
We can be profitable in 2021
because it's mostly water.
I actually think you could
increase your price potentially.
Lubetzky: I don't think so.
That kills
your differentiation.
