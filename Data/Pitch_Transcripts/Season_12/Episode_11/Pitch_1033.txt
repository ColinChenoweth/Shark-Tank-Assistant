Hi, Sharks.
I'm Kweku Larbi.
I'm about to introduce you
to the most revolutionary,
most innovative coffee maker
that will change
the game entirely.
Are you guys ready for this?
Herjavec: Yes.
Here it is!
Greiner: Oh. [ Laughs ]
Ohh!
Whoo!
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my gosh!
You think that piece of junk is
gonna change the game of coffee?
You're crazy!
You're probably wondering,
who's this guy
who's been sitting in
a coffee cup for the last hour?
My name's Ross Smith.
I'm a social media influencer.
I have over 45 million followers
across all platforms.
And my mission is
to make the world smile.
Our friend Kweku created
a solution that was so good
that I had to
partner up with them.
And together, we both created
the one and only Brumachen.
The Brumachen is a single?serve
portable brewer
that makes a hot cup of coffee
at a push of a button.
So no more waiting
in long lines
or stalling
in drive?throughs.
I've taken the Brumachen
all around the world ??
in cabs, on boats,
camping, you name it.
It is extremely portable.
It is.
And now Kweku will show you
how it works.
Sharks, pay attention
to the screen.
First, you plug it in.
You pour your water in.
Doesn't matter temperature.
You insert any
single?serve coffee pod.
Oh, wow.
And at a push of a button and
a short five?minute wait, guys,
you have a fresh cup of coffee
ready to go...
Cool.
...anywhere, anytime.
[ Chuckles ]
Now we'd like to ask you
for $1 million
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
And one cup of coffee.
You know what?
It's giving season.
Two cups of coffee.
Two cups of coffee!
There we go.
Who's sold?
Well, Sharks, we're gonna
make a brew right now.
Ross, can you please get me
a coffee pod from that tent?
Huh.
Oh, man.
What the heck, Kweku?!
Yeah, Ross, that's
1,000 coffee pods.
That's the amount the average
American will use this year
when they use single?serve
plastic pods.
Bro, this is so wasteful.
It's absolutely wasteful.
It's why at Brumachen, we didn't
stop at one innovation.
We went beyond.
We created this.
It's a biodegradable
single?serve coffee pod
made out of materials
like sugar cane and tree fibers.
Guys, those pods take
450 years to biodegrade.
This takes 180 days.
We don't got time for that.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
No, man, that's messed up.
Truly.
Sharks,
you have the opportunity
to put your money into something
that isn't just a product.
It goes beyond that.
It preserves the planet
for the next generation.
Well, Sharks, you ready to make
Brumachen the next big thing?
Kweku, are you or your parents
from Ghana?
Yes.
Were you born
on Wednesday?
Yeah. How does he
know this stuff?
Wow.
Magician right there.
That's crazy.
People from the Asante tribe,
they name their children
based on the day of the week
that they're born.
Exactly.
So, guys, your coffee pod,
you twist the top off,
twist it in half.
And twist it in half.
Then you take your coffee pod,
puncture it right in there.
Push it in.
Then take the nipple off.
And you pour
the water in.
And twist really tight.
Really tight.
Yeah, you should feel it lock.
And then we press
the blue button.
Yes, and then you press
the power button.
Tell me, how did you
come up with this?
Well, I work construction.
I'm a civil engineer.
So I was in a field
with the guys in the winter.
And I live in Indiana.
Construction guys, they're out
there in the freezing cold.
And they had to go 10?minute
drive to get a cup of coffee
and come back
to the site.
And that's like 20 minutes.
If you multiply that
by 10 workers,
you're spending a pretty buck
on coffee, you know.
So my goal was,
how do you bridge in between
having a coffee machine at home
and in an office?
But when you're on the go
in between those spaces,
your only option
is to buy.
And I was like, we could make
something that could actually
keep that self?brewing feature
in coffee.
So people can now do that
with our machine.
How much is it?
It's $120 retail.
Greiner: And why does it
cost you to make?
$38.
Do you have a patent?
Yeah, I have a utility patent
pending
for both the pods
and the machine.
Lubetzky:
Can you tell us a little bit
about how did you go
from Ghana to Indiana?
Well, I grew up in Ghana.
At 17, I graduated
from high school,
and I decided I would chase
a career of civil engineering
in the United States.
So I kind of kissed
my family goodbye
and I arrived in United States
with $2,000 in my pockets.
I arrived on campus
in Cleveland State,
and I ended up
working a job
scrubbing toilets in the morning
at 5:30 a. m.
to make money
to keep myself going.
Greiner: Wow. So what is
your role in this?
You're a social media
influencer?
What do you do?
So, yeah, a little bit
of background about me.
I over the last eight years have
gotten billions of impressions
and views and over
45 million followers.
You look over here, my
94?year?old grandmother,
who's my co?star,
and we've been doing it together
the whole entire time.
Herjavec: Oh, wow.
Everything's with
your grandma?
Not everything,
but she's my main star.
So I have the ability to push
products and push people.
And that's kind of why I'm here.
But what's your role
in the company?
I'm marketing.
This is my brand.
I'm using my social media
to back this.
I'm pushing it
with all my might.
For the last week,
I got 100 million impressions
just on my platforms.
Well, then
let's get to sales.
We started on Kickstarter.
We sold 600 units
in January.
Did you deliver
the Kickstarter units yet?
Yes, we have.
You can tell it's designed
by an engineer
because it's all built
around functionality
as opposed to looks, right?
Yes.
It looks a little bit
like a spaceship, right?
I always say it looks
like a camera lens.
And that's what's missing.
You did how much in revenue
on your Kickstarter?
$42,000.
Just tell me
your total sales.
Okay, $42,000 to date.
That's it?
Yes, that's all we did.
Mr. Wonderful.
Please.
Oh, my goodness.
Are you kidding?
You think this is worth
$10 million?
Absolutely.
Now I'm gonna rip you to pieces.
Are you out of your mind?
Why would you think
this is worth $10 million?
Well, because
just my push alone,
I can get 100 million
impressions in a week on my own.
You can buy those.
What does that have to do
with anything?
And I can sell ??
I've already sold products.
Can I monetize
your impressions?
Do I get money for that?
You sold $42,000 worth.
No, because we haven't
done the push yet.
That was just to see
if the practicality was good.
Exactly ??
I haven't even jumped on.
I had a product last year
on e?commerce
that made $33,000.
I brought it on.
$9 million this year.
Cuban: Single?serve,
take it with you,
portable,
preserve the environment.
That's all good.
But like any product, it comes
down to the actual design.
Like, I started playing with it,
and there's just
too many moving pieces
that you had to explain.
You're asking for $1 million,
and you haven't really
shown us anything
to say you deserve
$1 million.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Appreciate that.
Appreciate that.
I think it's a great product,
horrible design.
But let's put all that aside
for a sec,
because I love the concept,
I love you.
$1 million for 10%.
The challenge when you ask
for that kind of money
and a $10 million valuation
is you've gone out of the world
of belief and theory
and now you're
in the world of proof.
You have to give me proof
that it's worth that.
It's ridiculous.
I'm out.
You know what? It's still
an early?stage prototype.
There's still a long journey,
so your valuation and the amount
of money you're asking
is just very hard.
And I'm actually, like,
sad and upset
because you have
great energy.
Yeah.
I love you guys.
Herjavec: It's so sad.
I'd love to be, but you made it
impossible for us.
So I wish you the best.
I'm out.
Greiner: It's clever.
I think that
always problem?solution things
are great,
but today you came in asking
for $1 million for 10%,
and everybody said
sort of the same thing.
You guys, $1 million
is so much money.
?It's just too rich.
?You can still do that.
Is there a way
to shift your deal?
So, sadly, I'm out.
Thank you.
You know, I'm offended
at this valuation.
$10 million? That's obscene.
That's ridiculous.
It's stupid.
And as a result, you're going
to walk away with nothing.
?That's ??
?And so it's your mistake,
not mine.
Our goal is
to have inventory.
I'm here.
I've got a million bucks.
But you're not getting
any of it,
zero, or any from anybody else
because of your mistake,
your greed,
your decision, your strategy,
even with the Rosco Man there.
It doesn't matter.
Mr. Wonderful, I don't plan
to pay myself
for the next few years
until this takes off.
The goal of this
is not to build wealth.
Who cares if you're paying
yourself?
It's a million bucks.
Anyways, guys, I'm out.
70% gross margins
at scale.
We can be profitable in 2021
because it's mostly water.
I actually think you could
increase your price potentially.
Lubetzky: I don't think so.
That kills
your differentiation.
And so we crossed
the border,
we come here,
and we have nothing.
Like, we had nothing.
But my dad was happy.
He would rather have nothing
but an opportunity.
?Yeah.
?Obviously, I think
it's one of the greatest
countries in the world.
?We are same page.
?Yeah.
