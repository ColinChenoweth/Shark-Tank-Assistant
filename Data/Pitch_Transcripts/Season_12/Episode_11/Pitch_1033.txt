How's it going, Sharks?
My name is Maddie.
And I'm Paul.
We're seeking $150,000
for 5%
of our "fizz?ness."
We all know
the sparkling water category
is bubbling over
right now,
but nearly every brand
has the same boring flavors,
uninspired packaging,
and often artificial
ingredients.
Aura Bora is a line of
herbal sparkling waters
made with sophisticated
ingredients,
eye?catching branding,
and natural flavors.
Every can is filled with
real herbal extracts,
fruits, and flowers.
We like to say
it's just good clean...
...yum!
Yum!
?[ Chuckles ]
?Come meet our five
heavenly varieties ??
lemongrass coconut,
peppermint watermelon,
lavender cucumber,
basil berry,
and cactus rose.
We can't wait for you
to dive into those samples
in front of you.
So, Sharks...
"Water" are you waiting for?
[water]
Tada!
Whoo?hoo!
[ Can tab pops ]
?Oh, wow, that's very nice.
?Wow, it's really nice.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
I was expecting yet another
bubbly water.
I'm not into the taste
of cactus.
Cactus is not my thing.
?Oh.
?Hey, herbal flavors
can be polarizing.
There's the one you hate,
one you love.
Yes, they can.
And that's okay.
?Basil berry. I like it.
?Great.
The lavender
is incredible.
?The packaging is really fun.
?Thank you.
That's the best seller?
Best seller right now.
Yes, sir.
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, lavender.
No, no, no.
Is there a calories in it,
Maddie?
Zero.
Zero calories, zero sugar,
zero sodium.
O'Leary: Is there artificial
sweetener of any kind?
Not at all.
?That's fantastic.
?Thank you.
?What's your background?
?Okay, so we're married.
I've spent my entire
short career ??
I'm only 26 ??
in branding.
I now work full time for
a tech company in San Francisco
on a branding team,
and I actually take
my marketing tips and tricks
I learn there home
and work as the creative
director for Aura Bora.
I'm on it full time,
so I work on Aura Bora
day in, day out,
weekends, late nights.
Previous to this,
I worked in finance.
So, Paul, I will say one thing.
We get so many beverage deals
in "Shark Tank."
Yeah.
I always admire the sheer guts
to come in here
with another beverage.
Before I just go into
my whole cockroach routine,
tell me, give me
one aura of hope,
even the slightest sliver
of a chance
that you can somehow
get distribution.
Yeah, great question.
We're already working with
the two largest natural food
distributors in the country.
We could scale our manufacturing
10 times at our current volume.
And then, finally,
we're getting great velocity
off shelves in stores
that we're sold.
What are your sales?
You have evidence of
sell?through on shelf?
?We do 100% sell?through.
?Where? Where?
We're in 488 stores
as of today.
?Wow!
?You actually have sales?
So, to date, we've done
$200,000 in sales.
?Am I ?? $200,000?!
?$200,000.
We started selling this product
in January.
Cuban: What's getting
people to pick up?
Are you doing tastings?
Are you spending
a lot on promotion?
So, before COVID,
I was sampling four days a week,
as much as possible,
getting to know the consumers,
seeing their reactions,
et cetera.
During COVID,
we couldn't do that.
So it turned into a bit
of a telemarketing business
for a few weeks where I'd call
and ask as many employees,
"Hey, is it selling?
How's it going?"
So you're a true noodge,
right?
Oh, my gosh.
The number of stores
he's dressed up as not himself
to walk into and pretend
he's interested and ask
where the product is...
We need to get
honest feedback, right?
If you're at
a trade show...
Do you own 100% of the company?
Have you brought in investors?
Where are you at?
Yeah, we've raised
$700,000 to date.
?Wow.
?So right now,
we own 74% of the business
between the two of us.
Okay. So what does a can cost
at retail?
We make that can
for 57 cents.
We sell to our distributor
for $1.15.
It's exactly
a 50% margin.
And then it sells on the shelf
for $1.99.
We're going to end this year
somewhere between
$500,000 and $600,000.
Next year, though,
we are already in talks
with a number
of big?box retailers.
We anticipate finishing
next year
between $2.5 million
and $3.5 million.
Listen, you two couldn't be
more appealing if you tried.
I think that you did
great marketing.
I like the name.
It's cute packaging.
It attracts the eye.
But I need to be passionate
about every investment I do.
I'm not passionate about
all the flavors, so I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay, listen.
Paul and Maddie, listen.
You've done
a very beautiful brand.
I do think you have a future.
But in order to succeed
in sparkling,
it's a very niche
proposition.
And for that reason, I'm out.
What's so great about
this product is we can get
Paul:
That's right, yes.
That's your catch?22.
Right, guys?
?Right.
?Yes, sir.
When you're small
and regional,
the velocity
that you're doing, it works.
But when you try to go
national like that,
that lid on margins
is really going to hurt you.
And so where somebody else
might have to sell X cans,
you have to sell
X times two or three.
?Yeah.
?And just dealing with
that volume
is an incredible challenge.
It's really a hurdle
for you guys.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Let me take a stab at it.
You know, you were in
a long line of beverage guys
that have stood there,
a moment of silence for them.
[ Laughter ]
But it's so crazy.
The chances of success are
abysmally low, unfortunately.
However, I've always wanted to
add a beverage to my portfolio
just because
I want to be miserable.
?And...
?After all that?
Here's how I'd do it.
I give you $150,000.
I want 5 cents a can until...
?[ Chuckles ] Just what is this?
?Wait, wait, wait for it.
[ Laughs ]
Wait for it.
Until I get back $300,000,
then the royalty goes away.
So I double my money
for taking the ride,
and I get 5%.
I want the misery.
I want the misery of what
happened last week.
You might not be able
to go home, Paul.
[ Laughter ]
Uh...
?You got a deal!
?Whoo!
?Yay!
?Yay!
Paul: Come grab this.
Come grab this.
?Okay.
?All right.
?We want to celebrate.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Okay.
?Ready? Set?
?1, 2, 3!
?Go!
[ Poppers bang ]
[ All cheering ]
?All right!
?I'm so excited!
?Congratulations, guys.
?High fives! High fives!
?Thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
?Those are great.
?Thank you so much.
?Thanks.
?Best of luck.
?Well done.
?Thank you.
So great to see
all of you.
?Great job.
?Nice to meet you all.
?Thanks for your time.
?Congrats.
?Have a good one.
?Whoo!
Paul: Robert has a lot of
experience in digital marketing.
He can help us build
a direct?to?consumer
digital beverage brand.
Hey.
On top of that,
he loved Aura Bora,
which means he can
definitely help sell it
and we'll keep his fridge
really well stocked.
Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
