My name is Alina Kravchenko.
I am from Houston, Texas,
While some people
know me as Alina,
many of you parents
will soon know me as...
[ Twinkle ]
...your fairy godmother!
Let's get real.
Changing a diaper
can be a struggle.
First, you try getting
your wiggly baby
onto the changing table.
?Just like that.
?Alina,
this is an interesting
innovation.
But what I have
never seen before,
I'm so proud about my kids,
proud about Alina.
I ?? I'm ??
It's a dream come true.
You know, I come
from a communist country.
Okay, Alina, let me
take a stab at it, okay?
It's got patents,
which you wrote,
which is ?? was the first hint
that you're not nuts,
because that's hard to do.
But I wish
you had a partner,
another fairy sit beside you
that was pure executional skills
on digital marketing.
Mr. Wonderful,
I <i>am</i> that second person.
?My background ??
?Well, you might be,
for Alina's diaper cream
applicator SwipenSnap,
but he wants 100% of the patent
for other uses.
What I'm most interested is
in commercializing
the double thread
in a variety of ways.
Got it. Got it.
Contingent on us
being able to do that,
then I would be in for
the journey of 33% of this
Okay, Alina, I want to throw
a wrench into this.
I think the innovation
is around the double screw.
I get that.
All this contingency
on this contingency on that.
I'll make a deal with Lori ??
Wait a second. Hang on.
[ Laughs ]
I'll go 50%.
I want 25%.
I want her to have 25%.
I want us to be
50/50 partners with you.
I'm particularly interested
in licensing this
All right. Alina, you got
two Sharks, Lori and I.
What do you want to do?
Could you take
a slightly smaller bite?
Listen, if we get you
a licensing deal,
