My name is Alina Kravchenko.
I am from Houston, Texas,
and I'm seeking $120,000
for 10% of my company.
While some people
know me as Alina,
many of you parents
will soon know me as...
[ Twinkle ]
...your fairy godmother!
Let's get real.
Changing a diaper
can be a struggle.
First, you try getting
your wiggly baby
onto the changing table.
Then while safely
holding your baby with one hand,
you somehow try to apply
the ointment with the other.
Look at my poor mom.
She's getting it all over
her clothes, under her nails.
And she has to do this
up to 10 times a day!
It's exhausting.
Oh, no need to fear.
Your fairy godmother is here!
And I have a magical product
that will make
this problem disappear.
Ready, Sharks?
Bippity, boppity, boo!
[ Laughter ]
Introducing SwipenSnap,
the world's first and only
patented
one?hand cream applicator.
After attaching it onto
your favorite diaper cream,
simply pull the tube
from the suction cup?based lid,
squeeze a desired
amount of ointment,
and swipe it on your baby,
all with just one hand.
When I first had my son,
I was a young single mom
looking for ways
to make my life easier.
It's like what they say,
necessity is the fairy godmother
of invention.
So what do you say, Sharks?
Are you ready to swipe and snap
and live happily
ever after with me?
[ Laughter ]
?Good job.
?Tada!
?Great job. Great job.
?[ Clapping ]
You know,
I have 2 1/2?year?old twins.
I'm doing this
20 times a day.
?Yes.
?But I take this...
Yeah, right, Robert.
?Oh, no, I am.
?Yeah, right.
Oh, no, no, no, Mark.
I am, absolutely.
But I take this
to my existing cream?
Correct. So you take
the suction cup?based lid,
place it onto
any hard surface.
?Okay.
?This is the applicator.
You take this, and you attach it
onto any diaper cream.
So then you pull, you squeeze,
you swipe, and snap.
And this gentle applicator's
super soft...
Cuban: Ooh, that's cool.
...and allows you
to control the amount.
?Ohh.
?It's very nice.
?Just like that.
?Alina,
this is an interesting
innovation.
But what I have
never seen before,
which is very important
to understand
that you have two
different?sized bottles...
Yes. Exactly.
...and they both fit.
Is <i>that</i> something
you patented?
?Yes, I did it myself.
?You wrote it yourself?
I did.
And I did all the drawings.
Herjavec: How did you
learn how to write
a patent application?
I read "Patent It Yourself"
and put my baby down to bed,
and while he was sleeping,
read through it.
So, I invented this product
10 years ago.
Oh, wow.
?10 years ago.
?Yes.
You must have millions
in sales, right?
Well, I'm a single mom,
and [chuckles] it's been
a difficult road
being alone and with very
little connections and money.
That's why I'm here.
So you haven't sold any
in 10 years?
I have. I have sold.
My sales are relatively low
because I haven't ??
Is there a number?
I haven't marketed
the product.
What's the number?
$15,000 year to sales.
In 10 years?
No, no, no. I ??
I've been waiting
on the patent.
So about ?? it took six and
a half years to get the patent.
I mean
five and a half years.
So the $15,000
is over what period of time?
Yes. I recently ?? well,
two and a half years ago ??
quit my job and decided to
bring this product to life.
But you've sold $15,000
in two years.
You can't live off that.
No.
?So what have you been doing?
?Are you working full time?
I...
I have an investor.
And he hired me part time
to help me run
one of his operations.
How much did he put in?
He put in,
as an angel investor,
5% for $60,000.
How much is it?
First run,
I was selling it for $10.
And because marketing
was very expensive ??
?$10?
?Yes.
I increased the price
to $20, and people ??
What did it cost you
to make it?
$1.85.
How did you sell
that $15,000?
Majority of it
came from organic sales
because when I did
a pre?launch ??
?Online?
?Online, yes.
Have you tried to go
into any retailers?
I was approached
by a lot of retails,
but I decided
not to go into retail
because I wanted to make
the product even better.
So I conducted
a market study.
Everyone that had bought
the first version,
I called them
and I asked them,
how can I make
this product even better?
Because my goal was to make
the best product I could.
So you said, "No,
I don't want to go to retail"?
?I said not yet.
?How long ago was that?
Three years. Two and a half,
to be exact, yeah.
Tell us about
your background.
My mom brought me
and my sister here.
None of us knew English.
?From where?
?From Ukraine.
And she taught me that America
is where dreams come true,
so dream big.
Herjavec:
What's your mom's name?
?Svetlana.
?Can you tell us, Svetlana ??
Can tell us a little bit about
the journey of coming here?
I was grow up, and my kids
grew up in communism time.
I knew about America.
I was thinking about this dream
for my kids,
for my kids' opportunity.
It's a road, very long road to
come this country.
No family, no friends,
no speak English.
I'm so proud about my kids,
proud about Alina.
I ?? I'm ??
It's a dream come true.
You know, I come
from a communist country.
?You understand.
?I understand.
You know, my dad
was the youngest of 15.
?Wow.
?[ Gasps ]
And people used
to spit on him
because he wouldn't join
the Communist Party.
?Oh, wow.
?He got thrown in jail 22 times.
And the last time
he got thrown in jail,
they said, "If you come back,
you will never come back."
[ Gasps ]
Oh, my God.
Okay, Alina, let me
take a stab at it, okay?
It's got patents,
which you wrote,
which is ?? was the first hint
that you're not nuts,
because that's hard to do.
But I wish
you had a partner,
another fairy sit beside you
that was pure executional skills
on digital marketing.
Mr. Wonderful,
I <i>am</i> that second person.
?My background ??
?Well, you might be,
but you haven't convinced me,
and I'm the investor.
Let me. Let me.
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Herjavec: It's obvious that
your drive is unbelievable.
?Thank you.
?I mean, I can't tell you
how many people
came up here
and spent $50,000,
$100,000 to get a patent.
You read a book
and got it on your own.
But my issue with it is,
as a new dad,
I don't know if I would
use this for the baby.
I could get around
all the other stuff,
but I got to believe
in the product.
For me, on this,
I'm out.
Does the patent cover
the ability
to fit with that double thing,
or does that already exist?
Yes.
No, it does not exist.
This is the only patent that has
that double?threaded technology.
That's what
interests me.
I don't know, Lori,
if you're interested,
but if you're interested,
I would try to
commercialize that
while you figure out ??
I'll tell you
what I'm thinking.
And if you want to, you know,
go in on this together...
[ Gasps ]
I think
what you did was smart.
Oh, thank you.
I like
the quality of this.
I was thinking
this is a licensing play.
?Yes!
?So, Daniel, you and I,
$120,000 contingent on that
the patent...
?Okay.
?...will allow us to license
this technology
for other things.
?For 33.3%.
?Yes!
?We'll be 1/3 partners.
?Yes! Really?!
She's going to fly away.
Oh, my God,
I mean, that's ??
Yes. Well, do you
want to think about it?
No, no, I do. I do.
Let's negotiate.
I'm going to try to make sure
that you understand
what the offer is
from my side.
Yes. Got it.
What I'm most interested is
in commercializing
the double thread
in a variety of ways.
Got it. Got it.
Contingent on us
being able to do that,
then I would be in for
the journey of 33% of this
and 100% of any other uses
for the double thread.
?You want 100%?
?Of the double thread.
Okay.
You don't want to do that.
for Alina's diaper cream
applicator SwipenSnap,
but he wants 100% of the patent
for other uses.
What I'm most interested is
in commercializing
the double thread
in a variety of ways.
Got it. Got it.
Contingent on us
being able to do that,
then I would be in for
the journey of 33% of this
and 100% of any other uses
for the double thread.
?You want 100%?
?Of the double thread.
Okay, Alina, I want to throw
a wrench into this.
I think the innovation
is around the double screw.
I get that.
All this contingency
on this contingency on that.
I'll make a deal with Lori ??
Wait a second. Hang on.
[ Laughs ]
I'll go 50%.
I want 25%.
I want her to have 25%.
I want us to be
50/50 partners with you.
I'm particularly interested
in licensing this
and working on that deal.
And you're kicking
Daniel to the curb?
Yes.
I'm throwing him under the bus.
Greiner: Listen, I agree
with the licensing
because I think that
this could be used
in a lot of
different ways.
Lori, are you in
on this deal with me?
Daniel, I would have loved
to have gone in with you,
but, Kevin,
I'm in with you.
All right. Alina, you got
two Sharks, Lori and I.
What do you want to do?
Could you take
a slightly smaller bite?
Listen, if we get you
a licensing deal,
you're just gonna sit back
and watch the money roll in,
the royalties roll in.
You don't have to do any work.
We're good at what we do.
Are you ready to go?
Kevin, would you consider
just a slightly smaller,
smaller bite?
Why do you care?
Yeah, you shouldn't care.
You're not selling anything now.
You have the power
of two Sharks
that have done licensing deals
their whole lives.
We're going to, like,
get this done for you.
You've had no sales.
It's been many years.
Like, this is
bird in hand.
And the thing is,
what you created
and what took a long time
to get out...
It's so good.
...is that you brilliantly got
these patents of value.
?That's what happened.
?Right.
But now we're going to
get to work and see if we can...
Okay.
...monetize it.
This is what I wanted.
Yes or no? Say yes.
I wanted both of you,
so I think ??
You want to do it?
Yes!
Okay! Yes! Yes! Yes!
?Yay! Get up, Kevin.
?Ohh, my goodness.
I love you so much.
Oh, my gosh.
?Congratulations.
?Oh, my gosh, Lori and Kevin.
?Let's go make some money.
?Let's go make some money.
?Yes.
?Exactly.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]
It's exactly what I wanted!
?Oh, my God! I'm so excited.
?Wow! Wow! Wow!
Even though I gave up
50% of my company,
I know that Kevin and Lori
are going to connect it
to the right people
and get it out there,
and that's what
I was looking for.
So I feel great about it.
