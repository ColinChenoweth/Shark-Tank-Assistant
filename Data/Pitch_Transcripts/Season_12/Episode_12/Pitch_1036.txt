Green: That's what
I'm talking about!
And with the Yono Clip,
it doesn't matter
if the surface is vertical,
horizontal, or a diagonal.
You simply press, pull,
and hang.
Attach it
almost anywhere.
Take it
almost everywhere.
Especially in the age
of COVID?19.
This compact, inexpensive,
portable device
keeps your possessions
close by...
Off the floor...
And free from...
Together: Germs and dirt.
Okay, Sharks.
There's only one question left.
Both: Who wants to Yono?
[ Light laughter ]
Y'all need a stand?up routine.
[ Laughs ]
I like that, man.
So, now this, you said,
goes on to any
non?porous surface.
That's right.
So, let's talk about that.
Metal...
Green: Metal.
Yes.
...glass.
Glass.
Glass, plastic.
What <i>won't</i> it work on?
It won't work on brick.
Painted surfaces.
It won't work on brick.
Greiner: Brick.
So, one is, this is
very tacky and sticky.
Yes.
Yes.
And then when you
pull this out, right...
Yes.
...it causes a suction.
It ?? Backdraft.
Yes, and also,
I think
it'll really help
if we show the video.
Yeah.
Oh, we'll go to the video.
Yeah, go to the video.
The Yono promo.
And one of the greatest things
about the product
is it attaches,
like I said,
to a vertical, horizontal,
or diagonal surface.
A lot of people
look at the product
and think of a purse hook
on steroids,
but when you think
about a purse hook,
it only works on this level
of the surface here.
Greiner: Right.
It won't work under here,
it'll never work
vertically,
and with the Yono Clip,
you can attach it
almost anywhere.
John: I'm just curious.
Why didn't you make a little bit
more of a curve on it
or a double side to then post
on things like this?
I mean, maybe that's
rendition two.
Greiner: You could,
couldn't you?
Well, in that position,
you can actually hang it
from the carabiner clip,
so if it's upside down...
Mackey: It hangs down.
John: Oh!
Yes, yeah, yeah.
There you go. Yeah.
We're not playing around!
You thought of that already!
We're bringing the heat!
Oh! That's what
I'm talking about!
You about to be rich!
Hey, we can be rich together.
We can be rich together.
Well, let's talk about
you guys, right?
Yes, yes, yes.
Bob and I actually met
10 years ago at STEM Fest,
which is a youth
technology summit,
and ever since that time,
we've been great friends.
I personally own a company
called Science for Everyone.
I present interactive
science shows
at schools and other venues
all across the country.
What kind of science shows?
Corcoran:
You're a great performer.
Green: It's physical science,
earth science,
and for me, personally,
the Yono Clip is so much more
than a product.
It's like a light house.
Right, you can demonstrate
the science behind it
and everything, yeah.
Absolutely.
Every day,
I encourage children
to be the best version
of themselves,
you know, and I use science
as the medium to do that.
Greiner: And so, Bob,
what about you?
Yeah, so, the reason why I was
at the actual STEM Fest is,
I was a speaker.
Many of the kids
are disadvantaged youth,
and I grew up
as a disadvantaged youth.
I'm a high?school dropout,
I had to help provide
means in the home,
and then, eventually,
I went back,
obtained my GED,
and went to a four?year college.
I became president
of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs
of North Central Georgia,
and that was a huge
accomplishment for me.
I wanted to be that person
that I never had.
?Good for you.
?Good for you.
Good for both you guys
for what you do. Thank you.
And we became
pretty good friends.
And it's so hard
to find good people,
and I said if we ever
do anything business?wise,
I wanted to make sure it's
somebody that I can believe in,
somebody that
I can count on,
and somebody
who doesn't mind
putting their feet in the mud
to make something happen.
You said that
exactly how I wrote it.
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: That's great.
Let's talk sales.
So, regarding sales,
we're a fairly new company.
Within two months,
our sales are right at $14,500.
Two months old?
Two months. Two months.
Green: Two months old.
You're a brave man.
Yes.
How much did it
cost you to develop,
you know, the R&amp;D on this?
We actually launched
a Kickstarter campaign,
and we raised
$10,000 in a day.
And the $14,000 in sales
you talked about,
10,000 of it was Kickstarter?
Correct.
Yes.
And other 4,000 came from where?
On our website.
And then also
at the gym.
Guys,
what do you sell them for?
What does it cost you
to make?
Right now,
we're making them
in our homes,
in garage.
They're 3?D printed,
and they cost
retail $20.
It costs us 10 bucks
to make them.
Well, that's still
kind of expensive.
Yes, but ??
That's one of the reasons
that we're here...
Yes.
...is because we need
the capital investment
so that we can go
from 3?D printing
to a molded design.
That'll bring the cost
of the clip down to about $5.
Greiner: You're, like,
at proto stage.
You're really
just beginning.
Yes, we can only
print 10, 15 a week.
Right.
You're literally making
this whole component
by hand in your garage?
Yes. Yes, we are.
Absolutely.
Reminds us,
you were making
those FUBU shirts
in the house, Daymond.
That's what it does.
[ Laughter ]
You know, I think you have a lot
of heavy lifting ahead of you.
Mm?hmm.
Alright? I really do.
I think it's clever.
I think it's
a cluttered market,
very competitive,
and I don't think
it's gonna sell well enough
for you to make an occupation
out of selling it.
You have much more
important skills
that changes the world
in a much more meaningful way.
So I would see this
as a side hustle
and keep it that way.
For those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Guys, here's the challenge
with the product.
It's not that it's not
a great product.
It really has a utility,
but it's just not obvious,
or you don't immediately think,
"I need to go buy a product
that has a suction cup
and a clip," right?
So, that's gonna be
the challenge.
And so that's
a tough road.
It's just not one that fits
really well with me right now.
So I wish you the best,
and more importantly,
thank you for what you do
for kids.
Yes. Thank you.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
[ Laughs ]
Are you familiar
with a product
called DeskView
that was on "Shark Tank"?
Uses two suction cups
to apply to windows
or other surfaces.
Yeah, for the desks.
That's one of my deals.
I already know the demand
is huge for products like this.
You have good hearts,
you guys.
Corcoran:
Oh, giant hearts.
And so I want you to succeed,
and I hope you get a deal here,
but I can't be
an investor in this
'cause I'm doing
exactly the same thing.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Greiner: Let me tell you
what I think.
I am not sure what
all else is out there.
I like to go with things
that are more unique
in the marketplace.
I will hook you up, though,
with some injection molders,
so you can comp around
the pricing, make sure ??
I want two good guys like you
to get very good pricing
and make sure that you've got
a good factory on your hands.
But as far as an investor,
I'm out.
Thank you. Mm?hmm.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Alright, Daymond!
It's time to Yono!
[ All chuckling ]
Ooh.
Uh...
Hmm.
I'm on the fence, 'cause
here's the biggest challenge.
You're asking $150,000 for 15%.
You're basically saying this is
a million?dollar company,
and you absolutely are nowhere
at the moment.
That's not an insult to you.
But you're gonna need molds.
You're gonna need
social media.
You're gonna need
trademarking,
legal advice,
shipping, packaging.
So that's what
I'm wrestling with.
I don't want to insult you
and ask you
for 50% of the company.
I don't want to get
to work on this thing,
but I want to support you.
I'm really wrestling
with this, guys.
Daymond's good people.
Green: Okay.
He'll do the 30.
Alright.
So, I'm gonna give you guys
one last shot, I think.
Okay.
I will give you the $150,000
that you asked for
for 30%.
Do you accept it or not?
and be green with mountainFLOW?
Sharks, in front of you,
you'll see some samples
of our product,
and over here, I'll show you
exactly how it works.
MountainFLOW
is super easy to use.
It's the same exact process
as a regular
petroleum?based wax.
You just drip the wax
onto the ski...
...and then iron it in.
Just like that.
Once this cools,
you're ready to hit the slopes.
When I'm skiing ??
and I'm very particular
about my equipment
because I'm so good at it.
By the way, as an aside,
I have never skied
against a man I didn't beat.
Any age.
Is that a challenge?
Good for you.
My experience is everybody
drops it off at a shop
and gets their skis waxed.
It's cheap. I think I pay
50 bucks each time.
Would that be right?
Yeah.
And it's perfectly done.
I have no idea how they do it.
But the next morning,
my skis are perfect.
Who is your demographic?
We're targeting
all of the markets.
So, we're going after
the direct?to?consumer market.
These are people
who are comfortable
doing it themselves.
Do you sell it
to the ski shops?
We do.
So, if you can imagine
a ski town,
there's 10 ski shops
on the same street.
What are you
holding there?
So, this is a quick wax.
So for people who don't
have the equipment ??
the iron, the set up ??
this, anybody could use.
Oh, that's different.
And so it goes more to that
direct?to?consumer market.
It's like this.
A pad is in there.
You just rub it on your skis,
and that's it.
Why does a person
need to wax their skis?
What happens
when you're skiing
is that the snow crystals
are actually grinding
against the bottom of your ski.
So, if you have no wax,
your skis are gonna be slower.
So, with the wax on there,
what's happening is
that the snow crystals
are pulling wax out of the ski.
That's why it's so important
to use an eco?friendly product,
'cause, literally,
the deposition into the snowpack
Ah.
...is how the wax works.
I'm probably
the only snowboarder up here.
I call myself
Chocolate Powder.
When I don't have time
to go to Utah,
I snowboard in New York,
and that's like snowboarding
on a Brillo pad, right?
Right.
The snow can be
sort of horrible.
Or ice.
So I need to wax
all the time,
or, I mean,
it has no performance.
What are you making it for
right now,
and what are you selling it,
the average price?
Average price is $16 retail.
We make it for $2.50.
That's great,
great margins.
So then next question,
obviously, is,
tell us about your sales.
Yep.
Last year,
we did $150,000 in sales.
This year,
we're projected to do $750,000.
Oh, good for you.
Wow.
$750,000?
Wow. What's the bump?
We're moving international,
and we're also adding
a line of race wax
to our product.
Switzerland, for example,
has just mandated
no petroleum.
It's not petroleum,
but it's fluorocarbon.
That can't hurt you.
That's gonna help you
immensely, right?
Oh, it's huge for us.
Same with France.
Same with Germany.
Same with Austria.
The whole world.
The United States, too.
