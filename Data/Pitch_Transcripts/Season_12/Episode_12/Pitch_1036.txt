My name is Michael Green.
And I'm Bob Mackey.
We're from
Atlanta, Georgia,
and we're the inventors
of the...
Both: Yono Clip.
In exchange for 15%
of our company,
we're here seeking
$150,000.
Okay, Sharks.
Here we go!
You're at the gym.
You're about to get
on the elliptical
or on the spin bike.
But then you realize,
you don't want
to lay your towel
or your purse or your gym bag
on the floor.
Why not, Michael?
Too many germs and dirt!
Restaurant
or the coffee shop?
You're not gonna
just lay your purse
or your baby's diaper bag
or your laptop bag
down on the floor.
Why not, Michael?
Too many germs and dirt!
[ Laughter ]
Public restrooms?
Incredible germs and dirt!
The Airport?
International germs and dirt!
Diaper changing station.
Smelly germs and dirt!
Michael's house.
There's a few
germs and dirt.
In fact, Sharks,
we believe
there's only one way
to avoid germs and dirt,
and that's
the Yono Clip.
And it's time to Yono!
And with the Yono Clip,
it's as simple
as press, pull, hang.
Simply take
the Yono Clip,
attach it to any flat
non?porous surface,
pull back the center lever
to increase the suction,
and then you just
take your things
and hang it on
the center lever
on the carabiner clip.
And then you Yono.
[ Laughter ]
John: Get it!
That's a nice bag,
but, brother, those moves...
do 'em again.
And then you Yono.
Get it! Get it!
Sharks,
let me see you Yono!
Yeah.
And then you Yono.
And then you Yono.
?There you go!
?There we go!
Daymond is Michael and Bob's
last chance
for a deal for their company
Yono Clip.
I don't want to insult you
and ask you for 50%
of the company,
but I want to support you.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Shirah.
I'm 17 years old,
and this is my brother Michael.
We're from beautiful
West Palm Beach, Florida.
And we're here
seeking $60,000
for 20% equity
in our company.
As a recent
college graduate,
I'm no stranger to enjoying
a beverage at a bar,
restaurant,
or even a house party.
And while these environments
may be fun,
they might not be
the most safe or secure,
especially for women.
All it takes is
for you to look away
from your drink
for just a second
to end up
in a terrible situation.
Sharks, we're talking
about drink spiking,
and while it's not
so frequently talked about,
it happens more often
than you would think.
It can even happen
while you're holding your drink.
That's why
I created Nightcap,
a fun solution
to a serious problem.
It's a cover
for your drink.
But it's also
a super cute scrunchie.
Simply wear your Nightcap
on your wrist or in your hair,
pull out the cover,
place it over the top,
and pop in a straw.
When you're done
with your drink,
just put the cover back
into its pocket
inside the scrunchie,
and you're
on your way.
And the best part is,
it's reusable.
With Nightcap,
we've created a product
that allows you
to have fun,
giving you peace of mind,
knowing you're protected.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to take action,
save lives,
and get covered
with the world's
coolest scrunchie?
Sharks, in front of you
is a Nightcap
to try out
for yourselves.
Wow. That was fast
and really easy.
Cuban: Okay.
So I do it in my hair like this?
?Yes.
?Exactly like that, yes.
This is a widespread problem
on college campuses.
And who is your
typical customer?
So, 70% of our customers
are 18 to 24,
and 98% of them are women.
As for the problem,
when we started this business,
we surveyed 100 women
18 to 25.
26% of them said
they had their drink spiked.
Cuban:
And what does it cost?
It's $11.99
on our website.
What's it cost you
to make?
We make them
for $2.82 overseas,
and we can get this down
at scale to $1.60.
Greiner: How did you
come up with this?
Corcoran: What gave you
this great big idea?
Shirah: So, I came up
with this idea
because this happened
to a college friend of mine.
She was at a bar,
put her drink down,
a guy came
and spiked it.
I wanted to come up
with something
so that this wouldn't happen
to anybody else.
So I slept on it ??
literally,
because I came up with it
in a dream.
And when I woke up,
I went to my mom's closet,
grabbed her pantyhose
and a scrunchie,
cut them up, and created
the first prototype.
Good for you. Wow.
Wow.
I actually have
some prototypes here.
Michael: Some of the original
prototypes that we had.
So, Michael, where
do you come in here?
So, I am her brother.
I get that.
And I recently graduated
from Florida State University.
I was originally planning
on going to law school.
I saw Shirah's
prototype,
I saw her vision,
and being in college
for the last four years,
I understood the need
for a solution like this.
So I decided
to drop everything
and help make her dream
a reality.
And now here we are.
You know
I'm a numbers guy.
Why don't you tell me
the numbers?
So, we've been in business
for 11 months,
and since September,
we've done $68,000 in sales.
Nice!
But [Laughs]
$40,000 of those
have been in the last six weeks.
?Wow.
?Oh, nice.
Greiner: And why is that?
What happened?
You know,
we're very young.
We have no business
or marketing experience,
and it took us a long time
to really figure out
what worked, what doesn't.
Originally, I was like, "Oh,
we'll just run Facebook ads.
That'll ?? That'll do it."
That's not how it works.
[ Laughs ]
And so what we found
we were missing
was website optimization
and social media marketing,
and we really figured out
how to do the social media
marketing in March,
and then in April,
we redid our website.
And then in June,
we put those together
for an explosion
of sales,
and they've been
trending upwards.
So we've had
4,500 in May,
17,000 in June,
and 20,000 in July.
Corcoran: Good for you.
Yeah, baby!
That's awesome.
Greiner:
That's really great.
What did you
spend to get that?
And it's just
the two of you
running the company
together now?
Yes.
How much did you invest
in the company?
So, we funded this company
in three different ways,
and the first way,
with all due respect,
Mr. Wonderful,
we like to call our parents
Mr. and Mrs. Wonderful.
[ Laughter ]
You can call them that, but they
have to pay me a royalty.
If we make a deal,
then maybe.
Well,
they believed in us,
and they helped us with $18,000
to start the business.
So, the other two ways,
the first one was
through an Indiegogo
crowdfunding campaign,
where we raised $12,000,
and through all four
pitch competitions
that we competed in
and won $15,000.
You did?
Corcoran: Wow.
Have you been
knocked off yet?
'Cause this
isn't patentable.
No, we have
a utility patent pending.
For a cover on a drink?
Greiner: Is it patentable?
So, the utility patent
is for a drink?spiking
prevention device
coming out
of a wearable.
That's good.
That's great. That's great.
I'm gonna just jump right in
right here, right now.
I love this.
I don't think that
I have ever seen a product
come into the Shark Tank
that resonated to me more deeply
in a social mission way
as this.
Wow.
Yep.
I am worried constantly
for young women,
where women are getting
their drinks drugged,
they're getting
assaulted.
It's a horrible thing,
and it's super common,
and I think
this is genius.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'm gonna offer you
$60,000,
and I'm gonna do it
just for 25%.
Just 5% more.
I want to be a partner
right in there with you,
and I want to do
everything I can
to actually blow this up,
out on social media,
create videos.
This needs to be
in every woman's hands.
So, I hope that you hear
<i>my</i> passion about it
and that you take my offer.
That means so much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I've never heard
Lori that passionate.
I didn't know she had it
in her blood.
You better
grab that offer and run.
Cuban: Well done.
Great idea.
Shirah: Thank you.
Greiner: Great idea.
Great idea.
Came to you in a dream,
and now you have $60,000.
And you know what else?
You should go to bed
early tonight
and see what else
you dream up.
[ Laughter ]
Will do.
Cuban: Congratulations, guys.
Alright.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Looking forward
to working with you.
Greiner: Congrats.
That was pretty fast.
[ Laughs ]
Lori got this right
from the beginning.
We're so excited
to work with her
and spread this
around the world.
We're gonna save
so many lives,
and we're so excited.
[ Chuckles ]
