I'm Nancy Kalish
from Brooklyn, New York,
Cuban: No, Nancy.
What?
[ Corcoran laughs ]
Not for this size.
It's not gonna be
300?plus calories.
It's probably gonna be
190 calories ??
some a little bit more,
some a little less.
So, where is
the advantage?
Well, okay.
So, one huge advantage is
Nancy, where did you start
selling your cookies?
I booked a booth
at one of the huge trade shows
How long ago was this,
Nancy?
Nancy, that's a crazy
chicken story.
So, how much
have you sold to date?
So, our lifetime sales
is 1.3 million.
Okay.
1.3 million?
Yeah.
Nice.
Great.
Last year, we did 500,000.
That's a nice ending
to that story.
Did you make any money
on the 500,000 last year?
No.
We're still not profitable.
We are on track to break even
next September.
We got into the biggest
supermarket chain in the US.
How is the sell?through?
We sold, I think,
70,000 units last year.
Wow.
What does it take
to break even?
It's gonna take
till we reach
about $1.7 million in sales.
How much money did you put
in the business?
So my total investment is ??
I put in $1.6 million.
Hello!
What?!
Eeh, Chihuahua!
Shut the door!
Car?r?r?r?amba!
Was this your own money?
Yes.
Wow!
John: 1.6 million?!
That's a lotta cookies.
No balls, no babies.
Yes, ma'am!

Do you have any other debt,
as well?
I do.
I have an SBA loan for 123,000.
I also have a home equity
line of credit,
Yeah, but ??
but Nancy, look ?? look.
You're repeating
your same mistakes.
You're gonna have to
go against your home
equity loan some more,
And I'm sorry, Nancy.
I just ??
I can't go down the journey
with you.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
Well, thank you, anyway.
We wish you the best, Nancy.
All the best.
?Thank you.
?Good luck with it, Nancy.
?Alright.
?Alright.
Kalish:
Bye, guys. Thank you.
Good luck.
Congratulations, Nancy.
So, I didn't get a deal,
but I got a lot of great advice
from the Sharks,
