My name is Peter Arlein.
I'm from Carbondale, Colorado,
So, Peter, listen.
I love innovation,
especially when it's better
for our environment,
but I'm just
not a skier,
Peter has two offers
on the table
for his environmentally safe
ski wax company,
mountainFLOW Eco?Wax.
John: In my last book,
I highlighted Lindsey Vonn,
You know, Peter,
what's wrong with that?
It's under 10%.
Peter, enough's been said.
I think now it's your move here.
How do you feel?
You got a couple
of deals on the table.
What do you want to do?
I could do 16%.
I'd love to have you
both on board.
Peter, what if they say no?
And we can go skiing together
once the deal is done.
Yeah, very nice, Peter,
but everybody wants
to ski with me, quite honestly.
That's how good I am.
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
A deal sweetener.
We'll give you an extra $50,000
for the 20%.
So, we'll increase our in
by 50,000, to 300,000,
but we each get 10%.
Is that not
a compromise?
Um...
So that's $300,000 for 20%.
Exactly.
Cuban: 1.5 million, yeah.
?Congratulations, Peter.
?Thank you.
[ Grunts ]
All of the Sharks
understood the problem
