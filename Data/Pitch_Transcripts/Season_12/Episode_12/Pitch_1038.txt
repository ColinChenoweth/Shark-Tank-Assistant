I'm Nancy Kalish
from Brooklyn, New York,
and I'm here asking for $400,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company,
Rule Breaker Snacks.
We make delectable
better?for?you
brownies and blondies.
So, as chief rule?breaker,
it's my job to break some rules,
like who says
you have to feel guilty
just because you eat
an indulgent snack?
You don't ??
if it's one of ours.
How do we get away with it?
Well, let's examine
some typical ingredients
in brownies and blondies.
Take eggs, for example.
Ooh.
There are no eggs
in Rule Breaker.
And butter?
?Ohh!
?Ohh!
There's no butter either.
[ Laughs ]
In fact,
no animal products at all.
Sugar?
Well, there is some sugar,
but not too much,
and it's not our first
ingredient the way it is
in some other so?called
better?for?you snack brands.
So, what <i>is</i> our
first ingredient?
It's...
chickpeas.
Yes, beans,
but Rule Breaker Snacks
are so chewy and delicious,
you'd never guess.
Being 100% plant?based
is better for the planet
and better for us,
but there are some rules
we never break,
such as those that keep
our snacks safe for school.
So rule?breaker
contains no nuts.
[ Light laughter ]
In fact, none of the common
food allergens
and no GMOs,
no preservatives,
but they taste
absolutely incredible.
Look at all those
big chocolate chips.
Who wants to come
break some rules with me?
Please dig into the samples
in front of you.
Corcoran:
Good. You kept us too long.
You have
Deep Chocolate Brownies,
which are like fudgy
hunks of Heaven
studded with chocolate chips.
Chocolate Chunk Blondies,
Which are like soft?baked
chewy chocolate chip cookies,
Birthday Cake Blondies,
which have
white chocolate chips.
Then P'Nutter Chocolate Chip,
which taste like peanut butter,
but it's nut free.
Now let's see
how this goes. Ready?
Okay. I'm ready for you, Kevin.
'Cause I am
the ultimate connoisseur
of this kind of cookie,
so...
[ Laughter ]
Wow.
They really
taste delicious.
Thank you.
I thought they were
gonna taste like sand.
They taste pretty good.
Very good.
How are you getting
that hint of peanut in there?
Well, if I really told you,
I'd have to kill you...
[ Laughter ]
...but I'll give you a hint.
We use sunflower butter,
ground?up sunflowers,
and a little other magic
by roasting our chickpeas
in a certain way
that brings out
their natural nuttiness.
You know, I?I mean, wow.
And it says
this is 250 calories.
Yeah.
What would a normal cookie
around this size,
with all the bad stuff in it,
be around?
Well, it's like at least,
you know,
300, 400 calories ??
Cuban: No, Nancy.
What?
[ Corcoran laughs ]
Not for this size.
It's not gonna be
300?plus calories.
It's probably gonna be
190 calories ??
some a little bit more,
some a little less.
So, where is
the advantage?
Well, okay.
So, one huge advantage is
being allergen?free
and nut?free.
Okay.
Another thing is
being 100% plant?based.
It really is better
for the planet.
Chickpeas are a "superly"
sustainable crop.
They use really little water.
How did you come up
with the idea?
Alright.
So, I actually never thought
I would be
in the food business.
I was in the magazine business
for a long time.
and a bunch
of other magazines.
I wrote a bunch of books,
like "The Nice Girl's Guide
to Sensational Sex,"
some other books.
[ Laughter ]
And then I became
a health journalist,
and so I had interviewed
literally hundreds of doctors,
nutritionists, dietitians,
and I knew exactly what to eat
to be healthy.
And I have always had
the worst sweet tooth,
and I just decided for myself ??
I was getting a little tired
of being a journalist, frankly,
so I actually
thought to myself,
"How hard could it be
to start a food company?"
[ Chuckles ] Oh!
"I'll do that."
It's brutal, really,
and something ??
That's an understatement,
isn't it?
[ Laughs ]
Nancy, where did you start
selling your cookies?
I booked a booth
at one of the huge trade shows
and managed
to get my cookies made
and found a co?packer
and got my packaging done,
and luckily,
I was discovered by the buyer
for Whole Foods Northeast.
Nice.
And only problem was
that our products,
at that point,
had a very short shelf life,
and they had ??
Now they're shelf stable,
but they had to be delivered
frozen to Whole Foods.
Whoa.
Oh, wow.
That was hard.
And the distributor
had made a mistake
and stored them
at room temperature.
So, they arrived ??
The first order arrived
at 40 Whole Foods
in the Northeast spoiled!
Welcome to the food industry,
right?
?Oh.
?Wow.
[ Laughs ]
You're laughing
about it now.
Oh, my...
Oh, I almost fainted,
and luckily, I had a huge
stash of product at my house.
So I just got in my car,
and I started driving
to Whole Foods all over...
Good for you. Good for you.
Corcoran: Good for you.
...and pulled the spoiled stuff
off the shelf
and then replaced it.
That's called
detailing.
I'm surprised you weren't
arrested for shoplifting.
Detailing.
I know, right?
How long ago was this,
Nancy?
This was about
four and a half years ago.
Nancy, that's a crazy
chicken story.
So, how much
have you sold to date?
So, our lifetime sales
is 1.3 million.
Okay.
1.3 million?
Yeah.
Nice.
Great.
Last year, we did 500,000.
That's a nice ending
to that story.
Did you make any money
on the 500,000 last year?
No.
We're still not profitable.
We are on track to break even
next September.
We got into the biggest
supermarket chain in the US.
How is the sell?through?
We sold, I think,
70,000 units last year.
Wow.
What does it take
to break even?
It's gonna take
till we reach
about $1.7 million in sales.
How much money did you put
in the business?
So my total investment is ??
I put in $1.6 million.
Hello!
What?!
Eeh, Chihuahua!
Shut the door!
Car?r?r?r?amba!
Was this your own money?
Yes.
Wow!
John: 1.6 million?!
That's a lotta cookies.
No balls, no babies.
Yes, ma'am!
[ Laughter ]
Do you have any other debt,
as well?
I do.
I have an SBA loan for 123,000.
I also have a home equity
line of credit,
which I draw on,
and then pay back.
Corcoran: My God.
Oh, my goodness.
So, all in, how much ??
How much home equity credit
have you used up for this?
Uh...right now,
it's about $600,000, I guess.
?Ohh!
?Ooh!
So you're in for 2.35?
Na?a?a?ncy!
What is your
biggest expense?
Are there any large
singular expenses?
Yeah.
Trade spend, basically.
Promotions, couponing,
slotting fees...
Oh, you fell sucker for that.
Okay. I'm sorry. Ohh.
...refills, co?packer issues.
They were making you put ??
Ohh, I'm so sorry
you went through that.
Which I've solved, by the way,
but yeah.
Okay.
Let's talk about your margins.
Greiner: That's great.
Because there's a ??
53%.
Okay, wait.
One of these ??
The retail price
to a consumer is...?
Is $1.99 to $2.99.
What do you sell it
to the grocery store for?
$1.05.
$1.05.
And it costs you...?
50 cents.
So you got to sell
a boatload of cookies
in order to do this.
Yes.
Oy.
You're right.
Your margin is more like ??
Oy, oy, and double?oy.
Your actual margin
is probably about 15%.
You can ship this
directly to the customer
and forget about grocery
completely.
That model can actually exist.
Yeah, what are
you doing online?
We had already been
selling on Amazon
and doing pretty well
every month.
It was 35% of our business
in January.
Now it's 55% of business.
Wow.
You know, I wasn't crazy
about the flavor profile.
The peanut butter one
tastes like a protein shake
a little bit.
I mean,
I understand you have to
sacrifice flavor
for the health,
but you don't want a partner
who is not really in love
and obsessed
with the product.
I can ?? Yeah.
This is just not for me,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Daymond.
Greiner: I think you've done
an amazing job.
You've created a product
that I happen to really like,
but I just think it would be
a really, really long time
before I would
see my money back.
I will be a customer,
but unfortunately, I'm out.
Thank you. Well, I want you to
know I am very open to a loan.
Yeah, but ??
but Nancy, look ?? look.
You're repeating
your same mistakes.
You're gonna have to
go against your home
equity loan some more,
and that is terrifying,
and it should be terrifying
'cause effectively,
you're putting your home
at risk now.
And so please be careful,
right?
But for those reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, anyway, Mark.
What I love about you,
and I'm sitting here
dying to give you money,
is you're so damn happy.
I would be miserable.
Well, I'll tell you,
Barbara, honestly and truly,
my eyes pop open
every morning at 5:00 a. m.,
and I cannot wait
to get to my desk.
Good for you.
But that same optimism
is what got you into the debt
in the first place.
You're asking all of us
to buy into a debt more
than a business...
Well ??
...and so for that reason,
I'm out, also.
Okay. Thank you,
anyway, Barbara.
O'Leary: Your business
is worth between
$800,000
and $1 million, okay?
So, to give you
$400,000,
I'd have to get
50% of it.
This is un?investable
as it stands right now.
If you only want to sell
10% or 20% of the business,
that's worth 100 grand.
The rest you have to
take on as debt.
I mean, I'm feeling guilty
just thinking about that offer.
And I'm sorry, Nancy.
I just ??
I can't go down the journey
with you.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
Well, thank you, anyway.
We wish you the best, Nancy.
All the best.
?Thank you.
?Good luck with it, Nancy.
?Alright.
?Alright.
Kalish:
Bye, guys. Thank you.
Good luck.
Congratulations, Nancy.
So, I didn't get a deal,
but I got a lot of great advice
from the Sharks,
and I'm certainly
gonna take it.
They talked about focusing
my business online,
which is how I want to go,
and it's a clear
path forward to success
and breaking the rules
far into the future.
Rule Breaker is where
chickpeas go to die.
