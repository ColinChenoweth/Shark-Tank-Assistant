My name is Peter Arlein.
I'm from Carbondale, Colorado,
and I'm here seeking $250,000
for 10% equity in my company,
mountainFLOW Eco?Wax.
As a passionate skier,
I love spending time
in Colorado's
beautiful Rocky Mountains.
And like millions
of other skiers,
I'm using a lot of ski wax
to make sure that my skis
are running smoothly
in every type of snow condition.
But, Sharks, did you know...
that nearly all
the ski wax in the world
is derived from petroleum?
That's right.
The same fossil fuel that's used
to make gasoline and diesel.
That's gross, right?
And whatever
you put on your skis
goes directly into the snowpack
and then into
your drinking water.
Aaah!
[ Laughs ]
This is tons
of petroleum?based wax
in the environment
every single winter.
That's why I created
mountainFLOW,
the world's best
entirely plant?based
ski and snowboard wax.
It's biodegradable,
and it works just as well
as a conventional
petroleum?based wax.
Our patent?pending formula
has been rigorously tested,
and it's proved to be
just as fast or faster
than any comparable wax
on the market.
In fact, we already have a team
of world?champion
skiers and snowboarders
who are using our eco?wax
and doing their part to keep
the mountains free of petroleum.
So, tell me,
who's ready to hit
the slopes, ski fast,
So, Peter, listen.
I love innovation,
especially when it's better
for our environment,
but I'm just
not a skier,
and I really didn't
even know much
about waxing skis at all.
So, it's not the right
investment for me.
Unfortunately, I'm out.
Well, thank you, Lori.
My problem is, I've never
skied in my entire life.
So I'm out.
Okay, but we might have to take
you skiing, even if you're out.
You might have to take me
skiing someday.
And when I do,
this is what I'm gonna buy.
The one thing
I wanted to mention,
and I mentioned it
a little bit in the pitch,
but we have some of the best
skiers and snowboarders
in the world
on our pro team,
using our wax.
We just signed the
number?one skier in the world.
He won the overall
2020 World Cup last year,
and he's signed on
to use our wax
and promote it this year.
I'd like to make
an offer to you.
I'm really surprised
I'm offering
because usually when someone
walks into the Tank,
I take one look at their face,
I think, "I'm out."
And when I looked at your face,
I said, "Goofy guy. I'm out."
You just have that
big goofy face, you know?
But I'm falling
in love with it.
You're perfect for the part
of selling to ski shops, right?
I mean, who wouldn't believe
a word of what you said, okay?
So, I'd give you the $250,000,
but I must have 20%.
Thank you, Barbara,
for the offer.
How would you like an offer
from somebody
who's not gonna
insult you first?
[ Laughter ]
I like it.
I like the deal.
I really do.
I'm also a skier,
and I'll do the deal
for 15%,
just to squeeze
Barbara's head a little bit.
And you know why
he's doing that?
Because we were gonna
do the deal together...
but she got greedy.
...and he's a baby.
He's upset that
I left him out.
I'm not offended at all.
Would you want to be
in a partnership
with a guy who acts
like a baby?
I'm not offended at all.
She could be useful.
I'll tell you what.
I'll let her back
in the deal,
but you got to
give us 20%.
Okay, I'll go with him
with 20%.
So you get two Sharks.
I'll tolerate him.
'Cause I don't get out of bed
for less than 10.
What do you think about that?
Do you want two Sharks?
I would love two Sharks.
Daymond, I'd like to check in
with you before I continue.
I don't think he skis.
?He snowboards.
?He's a boarder.
Chocolate Powder.
Yeah.
Listen, my last book,
I highlighted Lindsey Vonn,
and I want to
bring this to her
and maybe beg her
to be part of my ownership.
So I'm gonna offer you
the $250,000 for 25%.
Ooh!
Peter has two offers
on the table
for his environmentally safe
ski wax company,
mountainFLOW Eco?Wax.
John: In my last book,
I highlighted Lindsey Vonn,
and I want to
bring this to her
and maybe beg her to be
part of my ownership.
So I'm gonna offer you
the $250,000 for 25%.
Ooh!
Lindsey Vonn is
the most winningest skier
in history.
But he's got
the number?one skier.
She is an amazing skier,
Daymond,
and thank you for the offer.
25% is a little bit
too much for me.
I can respect that.
I would just have
to split it
in the event that she wanted
to do it with me, that's why.
25% is just too much.
Lindsey Vonn is amazing.
She's an icon for the sport.
But we have a huge roster
of pro skiers and snowboarders
that are already
using our product.
Barbara, Kevin, I would love
to have both of you on board.
Unfortunately,
20% is too much.
I can do 15%.
Just think about
the value of two Sharks
that are actually skiers
that have different
skill sets and teams.
And in the long run,
we have to compete,
because in Europe,
everybody has to
convert to this.
We're gonna have competition.
We already have it.
So you want to drive
and get out there
as fast as you can.
Give us the extra,
you know, 500 basis points
or 5%,
and it's worth it.
It's just worth it.
I like the deal
with Barbara,
I want to do it with her,
and I want to get 10%.
John:
I'll alter my offer.
I'll do it for 15%
if I <i>cannot</i> get Lindsay,
and I will do it for 25%
if we <i>can</i> bring in Lindsay.
Think about all the earn??
We call it earned media.
You don't have to pay for ads
and a lot of other things
when you have one
of the most recognizable people
in history in the space.
Thank you, but that's ??
it's still too much.
Okay.
And in addition,
having that 10% for Lindsay
just seems like
a lot of money.
I don't doubt that
she would bring value,
but I think it's too much
to give her.
Greiner: I have a question
for you, though.
You have three offers.
Yeah, you can counter.
You can counter.
Again, for 15%, I think
that's a really fair deal.
I would love to have
both of you on board.
No, 15%, I'll take it.
What do you say?
I'll throw him
under the bus.
So you only get
one Shark ??
I would rather have you
throw him into the deal
and do it together.
Why not do 17 1/2,
meet in the middle...
It's not enough to share.
...and you get two Sharks?
It's 2 1/2%.
I'll do 16%.
That's an even 8% for you
and an even 8% for you.
You know, Peter,
what's wrong with that?
It's under 10%.
Peter, enough's been said.
I think now it's your move here.
How do you feel?
You got a couple
of deals on the table.
What do you want to do?
I could do 16%.
I'd love to have you
both on board.
You'd add a huge value to the
team, and we're all gonna win.
Peter, what if they say no?
And we can go skiing together
once the deal is done.
Yeah, very nice, Peter,
but everybody wants
to ski with me, quite honestly.
That's how good I am.
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
A deal sweetener.
We'll give you an extra $50,000
for the 20%.
So, we'll increase our in
by 50,000, to 300,000,
but we each get 10%.
Is that not
a compromise?
Um...
So that's $300,000 for 20%.
Exactly.
Cuban: 1.5 million, yeah.
?Congratulations, Peter.
?Thank you.
[ Grunts ]
All of the Sharks
understood the problem
and understood how mountainFLOW
can help solve that problem
and the potential for the brand.
So, to get two Sharks on board,
it's huge.
O'Leary: Somebody's gonna
buy this company.
I'm gonna make sure
that happens.
Corcoran: He's quick enough.
He's nimble, this guy.
No, he's smart.
I love this guy,
and I love this product.
I started to not
like the guy at all.
[ Laughter ]
