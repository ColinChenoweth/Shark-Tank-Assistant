What's up, Sharks?
My name is Wen.
I'm from St. Paul, Minnesota.
I'm here seeking $212,000
for 10% of my company,
Jax Sheets.
Pop quiz ?? How often
do you think single men
on average wash their bedsheets?
Once a week?
?Never. Never.
?Once a month?
No.
On average, single men
only wash their bedsheets
every three months.
?Ew.
?No way.
That's right.
It's so gross.
Like, their pillowcases,
like, thousands and thousands
and thousand times more dirty
than a toilet seat.
That's why I had to make
Jax Sheets,
the first bedsheets for men.
Nasty, sweaty, stinky men,
who, like Mark in college,
would probably sleep
on anything.
[ Laughs ]
Our unique blend
of bamboo?copper
allows Jax Sheets
to stay fresh for longer.
So if you forget
to wash your sheets
for a year or two,
no one has to know.
But wait, guys,
there's more.
Today only,
get a two?for?one special,
which includes my HercLéon line
of laundry?free clothing.
You can travel, camp,
and experience more
while packing less.
So, Sharks, who wants to put
a beatdown on some bacteria
and get in bed with Jax?
?Oh, my gosh.
?I love the name Jax Sheets.
And you guys have samples
there of the Jax Sheets,
debut edition.
That is silk
and bamboo and copper.
So we used our Jax Sheets
bamboo?copper,
and we fused it
with the silk.
This feels really good.
Okay, so is this
a commercially available
copper?infused cloth?
From us, yes.
We're currently going
through a process
to get a patent
on our materials.
So, Wen, what you're
offering us today
is really two companies.
Yeah.
A sheet company.
Yeah.
And a T?shirt company.
Yeah, with the underlying that
they're both
the same technology,
it's just that
different applications.
Are you saying it's the same
material in the T?shirt?
No, it's not identical,
but it's the same,
like, research,
same technology, same concept.
The copper infusion.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So the point is
copper?infused fabrics
that get rid of odor or bacteria
and keep it fresher longer.
Yes.
Yes. So, I went to Iceland,
took a little vacation,
and what I learned was that
my ?? my polyester shirts
and my cotton shirts
were getting smelly
at different rates.
And I got confused by that.
Like, why is one shirt
so smelly already
and the other one
is still smelling pretty decent?
I can make it work
for two or three days.
How'd that
work out for you?
It ?? It didn't work out
too well.
[ Laughter ]
Not very well.
I started learning as much
as I could about materials,
and I learned about bamboo,
I learned about copper,
I learned about silver,
and then I released a shirt
and everyone loved it.
And then after that they said,
"Hey, what about sheets?
The material of
the shirt's good.
Let's do some sheets too."
I'm like, "I'm down.
Why not?
Let's do some sheets."
That's kind of
how I got where I ??
You know what? It's smart
because it's a huge market.
Wen, are you selling these
today?
Yeah. So these just came out
on Kickstarter in November.
It sold $350,000.
Those are your total sales?
For this one, yes.
?Of sheets.
?Good for you.
Just of sheets.
So you're on Kickstarter.
Yeah.
And how much
did you ask for?
I asked for ??
I think it was $10,000.
And you got
to $350,000.
Yes.
Wow.
I was sleeping through the
beginning of this presentation
'cause I thought
you had no sales.
I'm glad.
I hope you're rested.
I'm awake now.
I'm awake now
because you have sales, okay?
Do you know what it costs you
to acquire a customer?
Yeah.
The customer acquisition cost ??
I got a little sheet here
just for you ??
[ Cuban laughs ]
...was $33.
$33.
And what's the average sale?
The average sale is $148.
And what do you make on $148?
What's your margin?
Our margin's
about like $70.
So you spend $33
to get $70.
Yeah. I mean,
that was before COVID.
Now, it's ?? I mean, it's ??
What's it now?
Well, I can't sell
'cause I'm sold out.
Wen, you sold everything in
November, December of last year.
Yeah. Yeah.
When did you actually
ship it all?
Four weeks ago.
It took forever
to get them done.
Have you sold any sheets other
than through crowdsourcing?
No, no, because I didn't have
the inventory
and I was worried about
making sure I can deliver
before I can start taking up
more responsibilities.
And the shirts, did we touch
on that yet, on how many ??
Not yet.
O'Leary:
Why don't you burn those?
Why are you
selling T?shirts?
You can't make any money
doing that.
I might.
What are your sales
for the shirts?
So I just released the shirts'
co?pairing, which is underwear,
and so this year
we've made $270,000.
And how did you
sell those?
On our website.
Your ask is $212,000
for 10%, correct?
Yes.
Why wasn't it $200,000
or $225,000?
$212,000?
You want to know the real answer
to that question?
Yeah.
No, lie to him.
Let's hear a great answer.
It's your lucky number ??
I know it.
Lie to me.
No, it's because I couldn't say
$200,000 without stuttering,
so I had to find a number that
I could say without stuttering.
Because once I stuttered,
the whole thing,
I'm going to forget.
So that's kind of why.
That's a great answer.
That's it?
You're an honest guy, man.
That is ??
I don't lie.
I'm sorry.
So who's running this company
with you?
It's just me, myself,
in my garage
just hanging out, you know,
with my lawn chair.
That's great.
Yeah, that's ?? that's ??
that's my setup.
I've been there.
O'Leary: Wow.
It's a good time.
My friends come over.
You're living the life.
I'm actually living it.
Like, even being here,
this is a great time.
I got to tell you, when you
pulled out the piece of paper
and said your customer
acquisition cost was $33,
how do you know that?
Because you haven't
sold anything
outside of
the Kickstarter.
So I'm looking at the amount
of money I made
and then how much it cost
in ad spend
to get those customers.
But that was
on the Kickstarter deal.
Kickstarter is ?? is almost like
an unreal environment.
I want to know,
if we started today,
how much would it cost you
to go get a customer?
Okay.
Okay, but you realize
that the underwear business
is different
than the T?shirt business
is different than
the sheet business.
Is different than
the sheet business, yeah.
But here ?? the thing is
because when people come to me,
they're usually campers or,
like, people that
just don't like ??
I get it.
But you're telling me
you're worth close
to 2 million bucks, okay?
Yeah.
So I have to try and figure out,
what is the business?
But this deal
has no structure yet.
I don't care about the underwear
and T?shirt business.
Returns are horrific.
I agree. You're right.
So I would forget
about that.
The sheet thing
is intriguing, okay?
Doing sheets for men
with copper infusion
to stop them from rotting
in their own beds.
I love that story.
We don't know yet
the customer acquisition cost.
And so you can't
say to me
that you're worth
close to $2 million.
I don't buy it.
I mean, I said it,
but it might not be true.
I don't know.
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: Oh, my God.
So I mean ??
O'Leary: It's ?? It's one of
those "Shark Tank" moments.
Cuban: Wen,
I want to hang out with you.
I want to
hang out with you.
I'm just a guy having fun.
I'm from Africa, man.
Like, I'm going to tell you,
I'm from a village.
I'm a ??
I'm from a small village.
Honestly, the fact I'm here,
to me, it's great.
This is a great time.
I'm so happy to be here.
Best pitch ever.
Wen, if the $2 million
isn't true...
Yeah.
...what number
do you think is true?
Well, my gosh. I mean...
[ Sighs ]
The Sharks are charmed
by Wen's honesty,
but he still needs to answer
the tough questions
regarding his bedding company
for men, Jax Sheets.
Herjavec: If the $2 million
isn't true,
what number
do you think is true?
Well, my gosh.
Like, $1.8 million?
That's a fair number.
Cuban: Wen,
you're incredible.
Look, you are this business
and this business is you.
It's my baby.
Right? Your baby, right?
It's my baby.
We would just corrupt it.
You're doing it exactly
the way you wanted to.
Every now and then,
somebody just hits it right
and gets a business
that fits them perfectly.
I don't want to kill your vibe.
I'm out.
Let me tell you
where I'm at.
Yes.
Couldn't love you more.
You know, we see people
that want something from us
all the time.
Mm?hmm. Mm?hmm.
Those people are honest
and they're sincere,
but sometimes they're not.
And when somebody comes out
that's pure and honest
and full of joy,
that's why we get so excited.
Yeah.
You are purity.
What you're not, though,
is an investable business today.
Kickstarter
is not a business.
You've got to go out
and actually get customers.
Yes.
You've got to go out
and build the business.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't invest in it.
I'm out.
I appreciate that.
Listen, Wen, I only like to deal
with entrepreneurs
that are honest
and real and up front,
and you are
that whole package.
And I see merit
to what you have.
It's almost like having
a really fantastic cellphone
without service.
Okay.
I feel like you have the premise
of a really good idea,
but I'm not sure
about the business,
so I'm out.
So here's what I think.
You're in three
different categories,
and they're
totally different.
And you're going to
need to learn
each one
of those businesses.
So that's ?? that's
a little concerning.
Mm?hmm.
But you can make
those decisions
when you don't have
a partner, right?
You can ?? You can sit there
and say,
"I'mma do this
'cause I'mma test myself.
I'm going to do this
because I'm making money."
You can do that.
But in the ?? in the event
things don't go well,
you're going to have partners
saying,
"Why are you outside
hanging out with your friends?"
I mean, that's what people
are going to say
when you have money at risk.
And you want to keep
your liberty right now
where you're at.
Okay.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
When COVID hit,
I told every one of my CEOs,
"Verify your customer
acquisition costs direct."
I got lots of chickens
in the coop right now
squawking for cash
because everybody's doing
the digital pivot.
And that's the one thing
I need to know.
Do you understand
your customer acquisition cost?
If you do,
Daddy has cash.
I want a return on it.
But you don't have that answer.
And so I'm sorry,
but I'm out.
You don't have what I need.
You're almost
the kind of guy
I'd love to see back here
with the data.
?Love to.
?Yes, absolutely.
I'd love to see you
back here.
My name is Wen.
All I do is win.
So, like, there's nothing else
I can tell you.
Honestly, it's a win
every day of my life.
Narrator: In season 11,
Brett Ellenson
and David Sodemann
made a deal with
Barbara Corcoran
for Boho Camper Vans,
designer vans that you can buy
or rent.
Greiner: This looks, like,
totally fun.
Sodemann: We try to make it
look like a tiny home.
Narrator: Let's see what
they're up to now.
Sodemann: Airing on "Shark Tank"
right at the start
of the pandemic
was bittersweet.
Right away,
we had our two busiest months
completely cancel
on the rental side.
We were losing
thousands of dollars a day.
We weren't sure where
the business was going to go.
With our rentals
just sitting in our garage,
we saw an opportunity
to help.
We decided to donate our vans
to first responders in Phoenix
to just provide them a way
to get away from the hospital
and relax.
As the stay?at?home orders
started to lift,
we saw a massive influx
of renters coming back.
Boho Vans are perfect
for a pandemic
because they're self?quarantined
by design.
It's a really great way
to travel right now.
One of the biggest issues
for our business
has been finding a reliable
source for cargo vans.
We've now partnered with a local
dealership for our clients
to purchase a van and turn it
into a Boho masterpiece.
In the year before "Shark Tank,"
we had done $493,000 in sales.
In the eight months
since "Shark Tank,"
we've done $1.4 million
in sales.
And we have another $1 million
of preorders on the way.
You've doubled your number
of employees.
You've tripled
your production.
It gives me every reason
to believe
that the sky's
the limit.
Corcoran:
Recreational vans of your own
that you can put your family in
and travel safely
anywhere you want in America
is not just a trend,
but it's the way of the future.
Today, customers are putting
health, safety, and value first.
So no matter
what business you're in,
you've got to
pivot your operation
to make sure
you're meeting their desires.
You're one of
the entrepreneurs
when I go to bed at night,
I don't worry about.
Sodemann: We started
Boho Camper Vans
because it's something
we truly enjoy.
We like to camp.
We like the outdoors.
It started from a passion.
Boho isn't just
a business anymore.
It's a way for people
to get outside,
spend time with their families,
spend time with their friends.
It feels good to be able
to provide that to people.
Then we went to a dozen.
Our goal right now is to find
a different fulfillment center
who can serve us,
one in the Midwest,
one in the Northeast,
and one in the South.
Greiner: Right.
