You're making a niche
out of that market.
Bring the data,
'cause you're such a nice guy.
Oh, man. Wow.
Good luck to you.
Now you have a goal.
Well, guys, you know,
like I said,
I do appreciate this.
?Wow. Good for you.
?Ooh, very nice.
We did $344,000
in revenue last year.
Year to date,
we've done $77,000.
Hey, Sharks,
my name's Nic Lamb.
I'm from Santa Cruz, California,
Nic, was that the wave
that knocked you out?
It was, yeah.
If we could get a replay,
you can see me actually
getting sucked over the falls.
This is it?
There I go. Yeah. Trying to
balance on the ocean.
?Oh, it's okay to fall.
?Oh, my God.
See me get sucked over?
Cuban:
That's got to hurt.
I'm trying to get my head
around it so to speak, Nic.
How big a market is there
for people that want
to put ice hats on their heads?
In the US alone,
there's over 40 million people
O'Leary:
Nic, it's interesting.
I'm very impressed by you.
I really, really thought
you were nuts
when you walked in here.
But you have
a clear plan.
It's just the size
of the market.
I think it's going
to be difficult
to acquire customers
to scale it.
This is my own opinion
because
a certain kind of person
will put ice on their head.
Finding that person
is not that easy.
But there's multiple markets,
right,
such as
the hospital market,
we have the sport market,
So, Nic, you had a problem,
you came up with a solution,
but I'm very dubious
about investing in this
because I'm concerned
about your competition.
Sure.
?Nice.
?I'll give you a hug.
Whoo!
We can't touch, right?
So are you sure you didn't want
to hear my offer?
Daymond...
Cuban:
Appreciate it, Nic, man.
We never heard
from Robert.
I had a great offer.
You never gave Robert
a chance.
Did you?
Oh, I don't believe you.
It looked like you were out.
Yeah, I don't believe him,
either.
No, no, I had a great offer.
I just think you were going
down the wrong road.
You just fell off
another seven?story wave.
Cuban: Oh, no, no, no.
A lesson learned here ?? You did
not allow price discovery, Nic.
What do you mean? You just made
the deal of a lifetime.
John: Nic ??
I just closed a deal.
I'm pretty happy.
Nic, Nic, Nic, hold on.
You know, people come out,
they get excited.
I get it. You should never
take the first offer, my friend.
[ Chuckling ] Oh.
If it's from the right partner,
you always say yes.
Greiner: Nic, you could
change your mind
Exactly right.
Appreciate it, Nic.
Good answer.
You're not a scumbag.
Congratulations.
You made the wrong deal,
but I wish you all the best.
O'Leary: Nic, you won't be ??
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate you.
Cuban: He's been saying that
for 11 years.
Greiner: Bye, Nic.
Thanks, guys.
Whoo! You guys snooze,
you lose.
We were waiting.
Whoo?hoo?hoo?hoo!
I jumped
on Mark's offer
because when you get an
opportunity like that in life,
you seize it.
You don't wait.
?Nice.
?Wow.
We sell it for $24.99
direct from the website.
?That's expensive.
?Oh, there you go.
Cuban: That's good margins.
You have a patent,
right?
Utility patent, yep.
Okay.
Hell yeah. Got you.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: You did it by
three beers. So there you go.
Alright.
So our biggest ??
Our biggest problem
is inventory, right?
We can't keep up through
the website right now.
Our sales have dropped in half
in the last three weeks
because we just
can't make it fast enough.
Wow.
You guys, listen,
I?I love innovation.
