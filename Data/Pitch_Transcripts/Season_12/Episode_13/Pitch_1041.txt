Hi, Sharks,
my name is Michelle Jimenez,
and this is my husband.
Andrea Meggiato.
And we're here
from New York City.
We are seeking
a $125,000 investment
for 5% of our company.
Whoa.
Sharks,
who doesn't love pizza?
As we all know, there are
pizza lovers all over the world.
Pizza is delicious.
But when you think
of frozen pizza,
you don't think of it
as an appetizer
or a high?quality
gourmet snack.
And let's be honest,
it can be hard
to eat those
delicious slices on the go.
Plus, the frozen pizza snacks
category has gone a bit stale.
But that is until now.
Both: Sharks,
meet the Pizza Cupcake.
Mamma mia!
[ Laughter ]
Andrea, how old is this?
Like, it tastes like you made it
this morning.
That's a frozen product.
Wow.
Yeah, we ship these
from New York City.
Yeah.
The marinara sauce
is our favorite.
?Really good.
?For Kevin to be silent
and just be eating
is amazing.
It's so good.
And it's 160 calories
for the margherita.
For one, right?
Yes. Yes, for one.
And 170
for the pepperoni.
Andrea, tell us
your background.
How did you come up
with this magic?
And I spent 10 years doing that
until I met Michelle.
How did you meet Michelle?
So we met through
a mutual friend,
and it was really funny
because he asked me out
on a pizza date.
And I said, "Pizza date?
No man has ever asked me out
for pizza."
But the twist was he wanted
to teach me how to make pizza.
I'm sure he did.
I had to show off.
Yeah, he had to show off.
And we've been married
for almost two years now.
And this is our first baby.
Congratulations.
You know,
I was an event producer
and then I worked
with social media influencers.
Herjavec: And how did you go
from this incredible product
you're making to actually
launching the business?
Walk us through that.
Actually, there was one event
that we did
that it was for
our best friends.
It was all a group
of Italian people,
and everybody loved it.
And, you know,
Italians are picky.
So I was like ?? we were afraid,
but they all loved it.
And she, with her, you know,
background, she was like,
"We need to bring this
to my events
and see
what the reaction is."
And that's how we started.
How do you sell it?
Yeah, so ?? so right now
we sell direct to consumer.
But last year,
our three distribution channels
were catering,
Smorgasburg,
which is New York City's
most popular market.
That gave us the street cred,
you know,
to really have
that proof of concept.
And then
we also did stadiums.
So our first partnership
was with Citi Field,
home of the New York Mets,
and they actually approached us.
Did you get
a commercial kitchen involved?
Yes, we produce
in a commercial kitchen,
and we also have a co?packer
who we've been working with
for the last nine months.
Lori, you might be familiar
with our co?packer.
We definitely
sought them out
because their biggest client
is Bantam Bagel.
?Yeah.
?What will sales be this year?
So this year we're projecting
$800,000 in sales.
But what do you charge,
Michelle? What is this?
12 come in this.
So a 12 pack is $24.99.
And how much is shipping?
$9.99.
35 bucks.
So $35 to get 12 pizzas.
Correct, and ??
Cuban:
It's 3 bucks a cupcake.
What does it cost you
to make these?
One cupcake is 95 cents
at the moment.
That's expensive.
Yeah, that's expensive.
O'Leary: Wow.
It is expensive because
we're making it by hand
in our commercial kitchens.
The recipe that we have
allow us to go
to 48 cents per cupcake.
And that's why we're here
for your investment
so we can start production
with our co?packer.
You're starting up.
You haven't even figured out
yet, you know,
how it's all
going to come together
in terms of shipping
a frozen product.
I think you're going to have
some significant challenges.
There's no question about it.
Good luck to you.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here's where I'm at, guys.
I'm not even going
to get into the valuation
because you could
be optimistic.
Really, I just think that
I don't know
if I'd be the greatest partner.
Soon as I saw this,
I was like,
"This is Bantam Bagels
in another category."
I know other people up here
who have stadiums
and a bunch of buddies
with stadiums.
Yeah, with no one
showing up right now.
But they will sooner
or later, right?
Eventually, yes.
Yes.
So I really wish you
all the best,
but in the best interest
of being a good Shark for you,
I'm not the best partner
up here.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you.
Herjavec:
Look, I'm really torn.
I think you're going
to get a better offer
than I probably
would've made you.
But, man, you guys are
the real deal.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Greiner: First off, I think
it's amazingly delicious.
Michelle and Andrea have
an offer on the table from Lori
for their business,
The Pizza Cupcake,
but she wants a bigger slice
of the pie
than the 5%
they came in offering.
I'm going to offer you
$125,000,
but for 20%.
Ooh.
[ Cuban laughs ]
Mamma mia!
What we can bring to the table
is worth it.
I think that we can help you
to skyrocket.
Ouch.
It's like a mob offer.
I'll be ?? No, it's not at all.
It's a great offer.
I could have gone higher,
actually.
I mean, you have an offer.
That's pretty interesting.
Yes, no, thank you so much
for the offer.
Well, you can follow
in our footsteps
of every single distribution
channel that we have.
Mark?
Yeah, guys, I mean, look,
if you want to stay frozen,
working with Bantam
is the way to go.
Here's the thing, right?
Selling frozen is hard,
as Lori will tell you,
as we've all done.
Getting the space
is really hard.
Getting it to deliver at a
reasonable price is really hard.
And so for those reasons.
I'm out.
But congratulations, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Well, you're ?? you're left
with Lori.
And, yes, no Lori,
20% is too high for us.
I feel like we've already gone
through a lot of challenges.
We found the co?packer,
which I think is
the most difficult part.
Would you be willing to do
$125,000 for 10%?
We work really hard.
You really wouldn't have to do
a lot of heavy lifting.
We have investors on board
who are also really strategic.
We've been in conversations with
one of the largest distributors
right now
who wants us to participate
in their incubator program
to get us into retail.
I know
the time and effort
and all of that
that we will put in.
I know you're going to do
the heavy lifting,
but I know that I will also be
opening so many doors for you.
If I can get you
into Starbucks nationwide...
Yes.
...that's 9,000 locations.
And then getting into Kroger,
Albertsons,
it will be
so worth it to you.
I will not go to 10%.
My bottom line ??
My bottom line would be 15%.
Herjavec:
Boom. You go, Michelle.
...direct to consumer.
And we ?? And we ??
I think our marketing
is much stronger.
It's okay
to stick to your guns.
You know what, you guys?
I completely ??
I completely
understand it.
But here's something
you don't know.
You said you were
learning the ropes, right?
What I know is, is that there's
so much more for you to learn.
And the thing that is invaluable
is learning experience.
I had no mentor. I had to figure
out everything for myself.
But I do know that somebody
could come and sit with me
for just one day,
and I could save them two years'
worth of time, of mistakes.
Also the connections.
Guys, you sound like
you're students of "Shark Tank."
You know your numbers.
I got that.
But you also know something else
about "Shark Tank."
When you only have
one offer...
Yes.
...you're skating
on really thin ice.
Yes, we know.
And now you have to
make a decision.
No, I know. Um...
Can I make
one more counteroffer?
Ohh!
You can do
whatever you like.
Would you be willing to do
$125,000 for 12.5%
and then 2.5%
in advisory shares?
Lori, what do you say?
You got a deal.
Yes!
?Yay!
?Congratulations.
?High?five.
?Alright, Shark hug.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Make sure my pizza is
at my house by this weekend.
Herjavec: <i>Arrivederci,</i>
pizza guy.
Jimenez: We're living that
American dream
where we have
our family business,
we have our dream Shark
on our team,
and we can just
really start scaling
and, you know,
having Pizza Cupcakes
as a household brand.
