You're making a niche
out of that market.
Bring the data,
'cause you're such a nice guy.
Oh, man. Wow.
Good luck to you.
Now you have a goal.
Well, guys, you know,
like I said,
I do appreciate this.
And no matter what happens,
thank you guys
for having me here, honestly.
Good luck to you.
Good luck, man.
Greiner: You're welcome.
Thank you for presenting to us.
Thanks so much.
Congrats, man. You were amazing.
One of the best ever.
Is today a win or a loss?
Today's ?? I mean,
every day is a win.
So whatever happens, I'm ??
So I'm born and raised
in Venice, Italy,
and I worked in the kitchen
as a chef since I was 16.
And I moved to London
to learn English
when I was 19 years old.
And in London, I worked for one
of the fine Italian restaurants
that is owned by one of the
largest private members clubs
in ?? in the world.
Soho?
Soho House, yeah.
And they gave me the opportunity
to move to New York
in 2006 to open
one of their members' clubs.
?Wow. Good for you.
?Ooh, very nice.
We did $344,000
in revenue last year.
Year to date,
we've done $77,000.
But we have a plan and we know
how to execute our plan.
So, prior to COVID, we were
really a restaurant business.
And so because of
the seasonality of our business,
we knew that we had
to launch e?commerce.
Direct to customer
frozen product.
Correct. Yes,
direct to customer.
That's tough.
We knew that was
in the roadmap,
because currently
we're New York City?based.
Our customers are from
all around the country,
and they wanted to know
where they could find us.
I learned something with
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
Yes.
The first royalty deal
in "Shark Tank" history
just paid its millionth dollar
to me in royalties.
Wow.
Fantastic.
But the shipping journey
we took
and the cost of the weight of
cupcake jars made of glass,
we learned we had to sell six,
not three.
I mean, listen, you're from
Venice and you're from New York.
You guys know what you're doing
when it comes to pizza.
Um, I'm going to
make you an offer
because I think there's
really great synergy
with my Bantam Bagels company.
Yes.
So Bantam Bagels,
as you know,
started with
a stuffed bagel ball,
and we got into Starbucks
nationwide,
and then we got into
all the major grocery stores,
freezer sections.
So that might be fun for them
to also be involved.
Come on, Lori,
you're making me hungry.
So I'm going to
make you an offer.
I'm going to offer you
$125,000,
but for 20%.
Ooh.
[ Cuban laughs ]
Mamma mia!
Hey, Sharks,
my name's Nic Lamb.
I'm from Santa Cruz, California,
and I'm here seeking
$50,000
in exchange for 20%
of my company, IceBeanie.
Sharks, as you may
be able to tell,
I spend most of my time chasing
the largest surf on the planet.
I'm a professional
big wave surfer.
Started surfing at 5,
competing at 9.
Wow.
At 14, I became the youngest
to ever surf Mavericks.
Only a few years later,
I'm now the current defending
Mavericks champion. Whoo!
But while surfing
Nazaré, Portugal,
the largest wave in the world,
I slipped and fell
on a giant 70?foot wave
that rung my bell and left me
with a serious concussion.
Oh, ohh.
Now, for months
after the incident,
I had terrible post?concussion
migraine headaches.
So frustrated with holding
ice packs on my head,
I knew there had to be
a better way.
That's why
I created IceBeanie.
IceBeanie is an all?natural
compression cold therapy
solution
to help provide you
heavenly relief
from migraines, headaches,
and concussions.
Simply toss IceBeanie
in the freezer,
take out,
and place on your head.
It's that easy!
So, guys, do you
or a loved one suffer
from debilitating
migraine headaches?
Are you tired of holding
the frozen bag of peas
on your head
or over?the?counter drugs?
It's time to take back control
of your life with IceBeanie!
So, guys,
who's ready to get cool
and invest with IceBeanie?
Greiner: Good job.
?You're right.
?Thank you.
Nic, was that the wave
that knocked you out?
It was, yeah.
If we could get a replay,
you can see me actually
getting sucked over the falls.
This is it?
There I go. Yeah. Trying to
balance on the ocean.
?Oh, it's okay to fall.
?Oh, my God.
See me get sucked over?
Cuban:
That's got to hurt.
Greiner: Wow.
I popped up and got a quick
little breath to survive.
How tall was that wave?
Six?, seven?story building.
60, 70 foot.
You know, but ??
?You are crazy, man.
How hard is that impact?
I love it.
It's like
an underwater car accident.
It's pretty intense.
You know, it's like NASCAR
meets the ocean, but I love it.
So I have a question
about this.
Yes.
So I know people
who have migraines,
and, you know, I've seen people
put things on their heads...
Sure.
...that have ice in them.
Sure.
Are you
the only thing out there
with ice packs in it
that are a cap?
So what I can tell you is
that there's nothing like
IceBeanie on the market.
Now,
there are other products.
However,
they are bulky, heavy,
do not all provide
full head coverage,
and all of them require
an arduous setup.
IceBeanie addresses
all those pain points.
That's why we feel we're not
only different, but better.
Are you saying that
the other ones
have packs like this
in them?
Some of them
have gel inserts, yeah,
but they all ??
you have to
apply them to the ??
to the product.
?Is this patented?
?So you don't have
a patent on this.
We're patent pending.
It doesn't fit.
So you got to pull it ??
pull it down, Robert.
John: Yes, it goes ??
it goes just around.
It's polyester.
So, yeah.
It goes just around.
It doesn't have the center part.
As the ice warms up
from your head...
Greiner: How does that feel?
Does it feel really cold?
It feels good.
Actually,
it feels really good.
Feels really good.
And your head will warm it up,
and it'll start to mold
to the shape of your head.
Does it grow hair?
[ Laughs ]
I'm trying to get my head
around it so to speak, Nic.
How big a market is there
for people that want
to put ice hats on their heads?
In the US alone,
there's over 40 million people
that suffer from migraines,
and over a billion worldwide.
But how many would actually
wrap their head in ice?
That's the question.
Cuban: Anybody who thought
it would work would do it.
Yeah, absolutely.
Well ??
Yeah, tell us about your
business and how it's working.
Yeah. Absolutely.
So the unit economics,
we source for $7
and sell for $39.95.
And where
do you sell them?
Right now,
we're selling direct to consumer
off our website,
Amazon, and Etsy.
Cool.
And how many have you sold
over what period of time?
So we launched
near Q4 last year.
Sales to date
are just around $100,000.
Way more than
I would have thought.
2,500 units.
Greiner: And what was your mode
of getting it out there
for people
to know about it?
Right, so we've been leveraging
a network of influencers
that I have ??
professional UFC athletes,
CrossFit world champions,
actresses,
and Olympic gold medalists.
And why are they wearing it?
What's their purpose?
Well, they wear it
after intense workouts.
I use it now more after,
like, an intense workout.
It's like cold therapy
for your head.
You know, and, yeah, really,
because I can see that,
like, instead of pouring water
on your head
or putting a towel on your neck
or one of those things.
I can see this
cooling you down.
Exactly.
It's cold therapy
for your head.
O'Leary:
I moved to Florida
so my head didn't feel like this
in the winter ??
I got to tell you.
Herjavec: And your average
consumer that buys it,
are they buying it,
like Mark said, for a workout?
Are they buying it
for migraines?
Do you have any data
around that?
Primarily they're buying it
for migraines, headaches.
And some of our customers
have had TBI,
traumatic brain injury...
Huh.
...as well as
chemotherapy customers,
because I believe
going through the therapy...
Yeah, 'cause I can see that
for chemo.
...their heads get hot.
Yes.
Wow.
I didn't think about that.
O'Leary:
Nic, it's interesting.
I'm very impressed by you.
I really, really thought
you were nuts
when you walked in here.
But you have
a clear plan.
It's just the size
of the market.
I think it's going
to be difficult
to acquire customers
to scale it.
This is my own opinion
because
a certain kind of person
will put ice on their head.
Finding that person
is not that easy.
But there's multiple markets,
right,
such as
the hospital market,
we have the sport market,
and then the hangover market,
you know?
Look, I wish you the best.
For me,
this is just not some??
a journey I want to surf with.
So I'm out.
Alright. Thank you.
So, Nic, you had a problem,
you came up with a solution,
but I'm very dubious
about investing in this
because I'm concerned
about your competition.
Sure.
So while you're great
and this is great ??
I'm not afraid
of competition.
I know. And you know what?
You're going to do amazing,
because you have
that drive within you.
I just don't think it's
the right investment for me.
Okay.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Thank you.
?Nice.
?I'll give you a hug.
Whoo!
We can't touch, right?
So are you sure you didn't want
to hear my offer?
Daymond...
Cuban:
Appreciate it, Nic, man.
We never heard
from Robert.
I had a great offer.
You never gave Robert
a chance.
Did you?
Oh, I don't believe you.
It looked like you were out.
Yeah, I don't believe him,
either.
No, no, I had a great offer.
I just think you were going
down the wrong road.
You just fell off
another seven?story wave.
Cuban: Oh, no, no, no.
And you fell
into a money pit.
My man. Exactly. Yes.
So, there you go.
We're gonna do really well.
I think I would have liked
to have heard Robert's offer.
No, who cares
what Robert's offer is?
O'Leary: Well, it might have
been a better offer.
I think ??
A lesson learned here ?? You did
not allow price discovery, Nic.
What do you mean? You just made
the deal of a lifetime.
John: Nic ??
I just closed a deal.
I'm pretty happy.
Nic, Nic, Nic, hold on.
You know, people come out,
they get excited.
I get it. You should never
take the first offer, my friend.
[ Chuckling ] Oh.
If it's from the right partner,
you always say yes.
Greiner: Nic, you could
change your mind
and hear
what they have to say.
Exactly right.
Appreciate it, Nic.
Good answer.
You're not a scumbag.
Congratulations.
You made the wrong deal,
but I wish you all the best.
O'Leary: Nic, you won't be ??
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate you.
Cuban: He's been saying that
for 11 years.
Greiner: Bye, Nic.
Thanks, guys.
Whoo! You guys snooze,
you lose.
We were waiting.
Whoo?hoo?hoo?hoo!
I jumped
on Mark's offer
because when you get an
opportunity like that in life,
you seize it.
You don't wait.
You just jump on it
and seize the opportunity.
And that's what I did.
And I couldn't be happier.
Oh, yeah!
Hyah!
?Nice.
?Wow.
We sell it for $24.99
direct from the website.
?That's expensive.
?Oh, there you go.
Cuban: That's good margins.
You have a patent,
right?
Utility patent, yep.
Okay.
Hell yeah. Got you.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: You did it by
three beers. So there you go.
Alright.
So our biggest ??
Our biggest problem
is inventory, right?
We can't keep up through
the website right now.
Our sales have dropped in half
in the last three weeks
because we just
can't make it fast enough.
Wow.
You guys, listen,
I?I love innovation.
I love when people come up
with new ideas and things.
You know, obviously,
people like your concept, right?
Yes.
You have proof of sales.
You did amazing.
My problem is
we all had trouble using it.
That's not to say
you can't fix it,
but for me to invest $300,000,
no matter what percent,
on something
that needs tweaking,
it's not there yet.
And so I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Wow.
Daymond, Kevin?
Guys, I ?? I think the mistake
was the 300K.
So, Kevin, we are on target to
do $3.2 million conservatively.
We think we'll be at $4 million
by the end of the year.
$300,000,
when I first saw it,
I said to myself, "Why?"
And I'm still here
looking at it, saying "Why?"
I'm just trying
to open a can.
I'm out.
Daymond.
?Daymond.
?Then there was one.
We've got 83% gross margins
on the product,
50% net margin.
We've got about a half
a million dollars in the bank.
We need a mentor
that can help us.
You know, I think there's
something missing here.
You're not seeing the pride
in what you've accomplished.
This is not a small
accomplishment.
Cuban:
It's really good, guys.
Why do you want a Shark?
What do you expect exactly?
I think they want
the $300,000.
No, we don't need the money
because we've got
a half a million dollars
in cash.
We need to know ??
So if you don't
want the money,
then why did you valuate it
so high for the opportunity?
This is just what we felt
we valued this company at.
And it's a starting point.
We're going to finish this year
at $3 million.
Yeah. This is...
We plan to do at least
$6 million next year.
We need some guidance.
Why did you price it so high,
guys?
Because
it's just a starting point.
It is what we are going
to finish the year off at.
Did you ?? Did you price it
so high
'cause maybe you don't
want a deal?
Not at all. Nope.
Okay.
I wanted to make sure.
Not at all.
We came here
for a partnership.
I mean, listen,
you want $300,000 for 10%.
I'm going to give you $300,000
for 20%.
Greedy.
Nice and slow,
nice and slow.
Get it on there.
There you go.
?Rotate, rotate.
?There you go!
?Whoo!
?Go, Daymond, go, Daymond.
?Oh. [ Laughs ]
?Ohh.
Too bad they don't
put champagne in cans.
You know what?
We'll figure it out.
We're gonna give you
some training.
Because you know what?
The fun part, I get it.
