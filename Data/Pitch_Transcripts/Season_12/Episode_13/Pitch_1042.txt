And my name is Armand,
and we are seeking $300,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
Pat, you know what I love more
than anything? Draft beer.
There's just something about it
that tastes way better
than beer in a can.
Bro, it's because you can
actually smell
the beer you're drinking
rather than the aluminum top.
True, but in most places,
cans are the only option,
and they're not
going anywhere.
Yeah, when I go
camping and fishing,
I only bring cans, but I usually
just pour into a cup.
Dude, plastic cups
are such a waste.
There has to be
a better way.
Alright.
How about this?
What if we just remove
the entire top of the can?
Oh, you mean like this?
Sharks, don't try this
at home.
[ Groans ]
Greiner: Oh, my God.
Bro, stop.
Sharks, we know
there's a better way
to experience
canned beverages.
That's why
we created Draft Top,
the only patented bar tool
on the market
that's designed to remove
the top of your canned beverage
and turn it into a cup.
Beer me, brochacho.
Here's how it works.
Open the handle.
Place Draft Top on the can.
Squeeze and rotate.
O'Leary: Whoa.
It's that easy.
And not to mention the top
is removed from the inside rim,
leaving...
Both: No sharp edges.
So, Sharks,
who's ready to...
drink topless?
Drink topless?
Herjavec:
What am I doing wrong?
Why can't I get this to work?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Hold on.
We're gonna walk you
through that.
So, in front of you,
we got a fancy version
of the customized tools
for you.
You can open it by pressing here
on top of the handle.
Just pull it out like that?
You got it.
Once in the open position,
you're going to place
the tool on the can.
Alright. You're going to
wiggle out just a little bit.
Once you get on, you're going
to squeeze the handle
just slightly until
the handle ??
the handle compresses.
Wait.
Greiner: Aah!
It didn't work.
John: Hold on, guys. Hold on.
We're having a little...
Did you get it to work?
My problem is I'm crushing
the can while I'm doing it.
It usually takes
a couple beers
to get the ??
get the trick down.
It's too complicated.
Well, I have a question
for you.
Sure.
Obviously, it was a little
challenging here for us.
I made a mess.
How many
have you sold?
Yeah, so we've had the product
selling for eight months now,
and we've sold $1.6 million.
?What?
?Yes, sir! Yes, sir!
Selling over
70,000 units.
Oh, now we're interested
in this.
?Alright. Now we're talking.
?Seriously?
So in December,
we did crowdfunding,
and we did $835,000 in sales
on crowdfunding.
John: Oh, there you go.
That's it.
So this was our second time
on Kickstarter.
Lifetime sales are a little
over $2 million.
?Hey, guys.
?Yeah?
So ?? So ??
Guys, look, I may be dumb,
but I'm not stupid, right?
If I'm having
all this trouble,
what were the reviews
on Kickstarter?
What's the feedback?
So we've had a lot
of great reviews
and we've had others that didn't
necessarily feel as well.
But what we've done is we know
there's a consumer ??
You mean they're not so great.
Yeah, but surprisingly,
not as much as you would think.
But we put out a lot of content
on social media and YouTube
where we have training videos
and stuff.
Look, guys, I can see this being
a great gag gift,
a great, you know,
groomsman gift,
but at the end of the day,
I can't even get it to work.
So we do tell the consumer there
is a bit of a learning curve.
So there is
an expectation ??
Yeah, but listen ??
listen to that. Listen to that.
Listen to what
you're telling me.
You're asking me
to waste a beer.
And that is never tolerable.
So you don't actually need
to waste a beer.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Mark, you don't need to
waste a beer.
We tell people to ??
to start with empties.
So collect
a couple empties.
Practice
with my empties?
Yeah, absolutely.
It works the same way.
There you go. Well...
You sold $2 million
worth of it.
That's serious money, okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
My question is why?
Why does
the world need this?
Alright.
It's ?? It's a fun item,
but it's not worth $3 million.
Guys. Guys, I?I've tried
four times now.
I tried it slowly.
I took the thing down.
I h?held it.
I put on the thing.
I can't get it to work.
I'm out.
Okay. Okay.
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you.
Guys, I've been here really
trying to work the can, okay...
Sure. Okay.
...trying to understand the
excitement about the product.
I get it.
Yeah.
But it ?? it's such
a pain in the heinie.
I mean, I was going to
look at it and say,
"Okay, do you have any
flexibility on valuation?"
[ Laughter ]
So ??
Of course we do.
Did you figure that
your experience here
would go like that,
with all of us laughing?
No, actually, no.
We ?? I do want to talk
about our sales.
Yeah. I want to talk
about that, too.
Okay. Okay.
What does it cost
for you to make it?
And what do you sell it at?
It's $14.13??
I'm sorry ??
$4.13 to make it.
It's 100% American made.
Pat, Armand, cheers.
Thank you very much.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Thank you, guys.
?Cheers, Daymond.
?Thank you.
?Cheers!
?Outstanding.
Greiner: Congrats.
Well, didn't exactly go
as expected,
but that was pretty good.
Cheers.
Daymond,
it doesn't work.
It does work.
Look at mine.
Let's see if
Mark can do it.
[ Clicking ]
You hear that?
You hear that?
You're crushing the can.
Greiner: Keep going. Keep going.
You hear that?
You're crushing the can.
Crushing the can.
Is it off? No.
Yes, it is.
Crushing the can.
But you had to push it in.
That's the way you do it.
You don't lift it out?
No.
Oh, you push it down.
Why didn't I push it in?
Ohh.
John: Yeah, you push it down.
Mine worked.
