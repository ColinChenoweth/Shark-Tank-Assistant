Hi, Sharks.
My name is Haley Pavone,
Way to go, Haley.
There we go. Fantastic.
Part of our key innovation
is we use completely
different materials
from any other high heel
in our midsole.
They're totally flexible.
When you have no body weight,
it looks like it has an arch,
but the second you step down,
goes completely flat.
So, I pop the heel off.
Okay, now, am I supposed to
also remove something
from right here?
Yes, you're removing
this sole?support portion.
So, Haley, how have you gotten
your $500,000 in net sales?
Haley,
you are super impressive.
Thank you.
I want to hear your background
a little bit.
Yes, absolutely.
So, when I was in college,
I already was very much
in the headspace of,
when I graduate,
I want to be working for myself.
go towards
growing the business.
You don't know yet,
Haley.
Why don't you wait to see
how many other offers you get?
Okay.
Corcoran: Haley, let me get
the ball going here.
I think you're
the type of person ??
you don't know
what you don't know.
Sure.
The most important part
of building a business
is keeping it in line,
Yeah, Haley, you have
$150,000 worth of inventory.
That's about $500,000
worth of revenue.
Haley, you are
a remarkable young woman,
but the product
is worrying me a little bit.
It felt very strange
to walk on.
So I don't know,
if I was walking
several blocks in New York City,
for example,
in between meetings,
if that really
would be something
that would be
comfortable for me.
I know you are going to be
a success in life,
but this, I'm not
100% sold on.
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
So, Haley, I ??
I think it's clever.
It's a good idea.
It's great for QVC.
I think you ?? Maybe.

I think it's good quality,
but $500,000 for 5%,
it's just not enough
for me.
Kevin is Haley's last chance
for a deal
for her convertible high?heel
company, Pashion Footwear.
All roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful.
I bet you, Haley,
if you could go back
Haley, a royalty
doesn't kill you
if you turn
your inventory quickly.
Listen, Mark, I don't see you
writing a check.
I'm encouraging her
to consider a royalty.
This is the only deal
out there right now,
See, Haley,
the way I look at it ??
What about a $1 royalty?
No, no.
You know, I would probably
be wearing these heels
in heaven before I got
my $500,000 back.
How about we do a royalty
at $2.50...
No.
...until you get
your $500,000?
Yes, don't be such
a "Bah, humbug."
No. No.
Look, I care about
$500,000.
That's not chump change.
Are you open to any
kind of counter, though?
You can counter all you want.
I'm not ??
I get that sense,
Haley.
Good for you, Haley.
Good for you.
Greiner: Good job.
You did a good job
here today.
Thank you.
Good luck, Haley.
