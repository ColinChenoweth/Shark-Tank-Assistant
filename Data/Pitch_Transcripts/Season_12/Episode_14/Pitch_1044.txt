Hi, Sharks.
My name is Haley Pavone,
and I'm from
San Luis Obispo, California.
Today, I'm seeking
a $500,000 investment
in exchange for 5%
of my game?changing company,
Pashion Footwear.
It's a tale as old as time.
A woman puts on
her favorite pair of heels
and heads out to work, out to
a wedding, or out for the night.
She is absolutely
crushing her commute,
tearing up that dance floor,
and looking her absolute best...
for exactly 45 minutes.
Suddenly,
her feet are on fire,
and she is regretting everything
about her shoe choice.
So I invented the ultimate
solution to high?heel pain
and inconvenience ??
the world's first
fully convertible high heels.
Now, not that I'm not
totally crushing this outfit,
but let me slip into something
just a little more comfortable.
With a quick twist
of the wrist,
our stylish high heels
turn into comfortable
and practical flats
just like that.
Corcoran: Wow.
Want to see me do it again?
Yes, we do.
That's impressive.
Whew!
That is so much more comfy.
Here at Pashion,
we are determined
to make traditional
high heels,
and all their ridiculous
problems, a thing of the past.
Now, Sharks,
who's ready to majorly disrupt
the massive women's
footwear market
and take the next step
of this journey
in some awesome
convertible high heels?
That's remarkable.
Now, I actually do have samples
for each of you.
They're in your size.
Oh, good.
You know
I love a good nude heel.
Way to go, Haley.
There we go. Fantastic.
Part of our key innovation
is we use completely
different materials
from any other high heel
in our midsole.
They're totally flexible.
When you have no body weight,
it looks like it has an arch,
but the second you step down,
goes completely flat.
So, I pop the heel off.
Okay, now, am I supposed to
also remove something
from right here?
Yes, you're removing
this sole?support portion.
Just grab it, turn,
and then pull out.
There you go.
Ah, okay,
the whole piece is off.
Yes. And that part
that you took out just there,
that's the removable
sole support.
That's really
the essence of our I. P.
There have been
removable heels before...
Yes.
...but no one's ever innovated
on a removable sole.
So I'm going
to stand up on this.
Ooh, wow.
It's, like, bouncy.
Yeah, so to put them back on,
you just hook this bit here,
pop it back in,
give it a twist,
it'll click, and you're locked
back into place.
Gotcha.
So I am assuming
that you have sold
quite a few of these.
We have, yes.
So, it's been a year
and some change,
and we've done a little over
$800,000 in sales.
Wow.
Now, that's impressive.
What about returns?
And what are
the returns like?
Yep.
So our return
and exchange percentage is 24%.
24%?
Yes, the footwear average,
though, is 20%
just because the sizing
for footwear is so difficult
to make perfect online.
And your sales are net sales
after all returns?
No, net sales ?? $500,000.
$500,000. Okay, so ??
Every woman I know
hates her high heels,
every one of them,
and can't walk in them
for more than
three or four hours.
Why was it you who said,
"Let me do something
about this"?
So, in my sophomore year
of college,
I was out at
a sorority spring formal,
and I'd worn six?inch high
heels, as college girls do.
But high heels
when you're trying to dance
are not comfortable.
It's really more of a wobble,
and I wanted to bust a move.
So I ditched my high heels...
[ Laughs ]
...and took to
the dance floor barefoot.
Unfortunately,
tragedy and inspiration
quite literally struck.
One of the other young women
accidentally stomped
her stiletto
through my foot...
Oh.
...and impaled me
through the toe.
Oh, my God.
O'Leary: Through the ??
Are you kidding?
Through the toe, yes.
Like, right through?
Like, clean through.
This is a terrible story.
And as I'm sitting on the side
of the dance floor,
it struck me as odd that there
is this societal expectation
for women to wear high heels to
formal or professional events.
Everyone knows they hurt
and that they're inconvenient,
and yet there is no solution.
So, Haley, how have you gotten
your $500,000 in net sales?
We are all online,
and we've been able to sell
through digital marketing, P. R.,
and then also word of mouth.
Haley,
you are super impressive.
Thank you.
I want to hear your background
a little bit.
Yes, absolutely.
So, when I was in college,
I already was very much
in the headspace of,
when I graduate,
I want to be working for myself.
And so after
that impalement incident...
[ Chuckles ]
...I dove in headfirst, started
pitching at different events,
and actually raised
the first $26,500,
and I actually got the first
working salesman samples
the day before
my college graduation.
?Wow!
?Wow! That's great.
So they got
their first break?in.
Were you wearing your shoes
in that graduation picture?
Yes, absolutely.
And luckily,
I'd actually built the company
up enough at this point
that when I graduated,
I was able to come on full?time.
I brought on
a footwear?development team,
hired on a COO,
brought on a lot
of student volunteers, actually.
All with $26,000?
Wow.
Yes. Initially.
We have raised more
since then.
Who owns your company now?
What's your cap table look like?
I own my company right now.
So, we've raised a total
of $2.5 million to date.
Oh!
Scott: Wow!
Corcoran: How much?
Whoa!
$2.5 million,
all on convertible notes.
So right now, I own
83% of the company.
But after they convert?
It depends, obviously,
on valuation.
But for instance, if you were
to take my deal today,
I would be at 45%.
Oh, and you know that we're
going to have to negotiate,
and so you're going to
end up owning,
if you get a deal,
less than 45%.
But I'm going to own a little
less of a much larger company
with the help of a fabulous
Shark, right?
Which I'm always
a fan of,
but how much cash
do you have left in the bank?
Right now,
we have about $250,000.
Ooh!
Yes.
How much inventory
do you have?
Right now, I have $150,000
worth of inventory at cost.
What's your monthly burn?
Our monthly burn right now is
about $90,000 before marketing.
Ouch.
Your burn is
$90,000 a month?
Yes.
So you have
three months...
Mm?hmm.
...of cash left?
Yes.
But, that being said, I've been
in this situation before,
and I did get out of it.
Something you should know
about me
is I'm one of the most resilient
people you'll ever meet.
Back in 2019,
we were in a situation
where I found us $80,000 in debt
and I realized,
"Okay, I have just enough cash
in the bank
to make it 30 days,
or we're out of business."
And so
I hit the ground running.
I pitched every single person
that would listen,
and I closed a million?dollar
deal on the 30th day.
And that's why we're still
in business today.
So, yes, it's a scary situation,
but I believe in this too much
to ever let it fail,
and I will get out of it.
You don't really want to give up
more than 5% here.
I mean,
I appreciate the value
that a Shark brings
to the table.
Alright, look, I would make you
an offer that looks like this.
I give you the $500,000
for 5%.
However,
I get paid a royalty
till I recoup a million bucks,
and then that royalty goes away.
And then the only negotiation
we have to have
is how much
that royalty should be.
I would like it to be
$5 a unit.
I'm not super interested
in a royalty...
You don't know yet.
...only because I want
every single dollar...
You don't know yet.
...to go into growing this.
Wait.
Here's what's ridiculous.
We don't even know
what they cost,
and we don't know
what they cost to make, Kevin.
Right now,
the product cost is $36,
and then the landed cost
is $47,
and we sell them for between
$150 and $190.
You have plenty of room
for a $5 royalty.
That's not a problem.
I do, but I'd rather have
that $5
go towards
growing the business.
You don't know yet,
Haley.
Why don't you wait to see
how many other offers you get?
Okay.
Corcoran: Haley, let me get
the ball going here.
I think you're
the type of person ??
you don't know
what you don't know.
Sure.
The most important part
of building a business
is keeping it in line,
and you stretch every buck
nine different ways
to see what you can get
out of it.
And I feel like
we <i>are</i> doing that.
I mean, I know we have
a high burn...
I don't know.
...but as I mentioned,
I don't have excessive overhead.
You <i>do</i> have
excessive overhead.
You're burning
$90,000 a month,
you raised $2.5 million,
and you have
three months left
before you're out
of business.
I would say
that's important.
I can't take a chance
on your business,
climbing those mountains
with you.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, Haley, you have
$150,000 worth of inventory.
That's about $500,000
worth of revenue.
That's another five?and?a?half
months of survival,
which then allows you
to create more cash flow
to bring in
more inventory.
If you told me,
"This is where we're at.
I'm going to sell
these shoes
because I need to focus
my attention to these things
to sell those shoes,"
it'd be a different story,
but that's not
where you're at.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
Haley, you are
a remarkable young woman,
but the product
is worrying me a little bit.
It felt very strange
to walk on.
So I don't know,
if I was walking
several blocks in New York City,
for example,
in between meetings,
if that really
would be something
that would be
comfortable for me.
I know you are going to be
a success in life,
but this, I'm not
100% sold on.
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
So, Haley, I ??
I think it's clever.
It's a good idea.
It's great for QVC.
I think you ?? Maybe.
[ Chuckles ]
I think it's good quality,
but $500,000 for 5%,
it's just not enough
for me.
And I don't think
$500,000's
going to be enough money
for you.
I mean,
I'm open to negotiating.
But as an investment,
it doesn't make sense
for me right now.
So I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Well...
[ Chuckles ]
...all roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful.
Kevin is Haley's last chance
for a deal
for her convertible high?heel
company, Pashion Footwear.
All roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful.
I bet you, Haley,
if you could go back
and if you could've
done things differently,
you would've.
And now you are 90 days
away from oblivion.
Your problem is sales.
That's the only thing
that's going to save you.
But the more you sell,
the more capital
you tie up in inventory.
That's the curse
of the shoe industry.
You need money.
I have it.
But I'm going to put myself
in a preference position.
I really don't want to do
a royalty, as I mentioned.
To me, a royalty is just going
to be very counterproductive
to funding growth
for this business.
No, it isn't.
It puts me
in a preference position
so I don't get diluted
into oblivion.
I'd like to counter
with $500,000 for...
8%.
No.
If there's no royalty in here
to reclaim my capital ??
Haley, a royalty
doesn't kill you
if you turn
your inventory quickly.
Listen, Mark, I don't see you
writing a check.
I'm encouraging her
to consider a royalty.
This is the only deal
out there right now,
and I don't think
it's half?bad.
See, Haley,
the way I look at it ??
What about a $1 royalty?
No, no.
You know, I would probably
be wearing these heels
in heaven before I got
my $500,000 back.
How about we do a royalty
at $2.50...
No.
...until you get
your $500,000?
Yes, don't be such
a "Bah, humbug."
No. No.
Look, I care about
$500,000.
That's not chump change.
Are you open to any
kind of counter, though?
You can counter all you want.
I'm not ??
But I've countered,
and...
Come on, you said that
you have changed this year
and all of a sudden a heart
transplanted into your body.
I really appreciate you helping
me with this deal, Lori.
So, to you,
I say, "No."
[ Chuckles ]
My offer's very simple.
It's $5 a unit
till I recoup $1 million,
and I want
the 5% equity.
And I'm the only Shark
that's making you an offer.
Are you open
to a larger investment?
No.
$500,000's plenty.
That'll keep you going for
about another six months.
And you're not open to
a different royalty structure?
No, no.
If you had five offers here,
mine wouldn't be the one
you'd choose, but you don't.
Would you do the $500,000
at 5%
with a $3 royalty
paid back to the million?
No. No.
With all due respect,
I don't think we're going to
make a deal today.
I get that sense,
Haley.
Good for you, Haley.
Good for you.
Greiner: Good job.
You did a good job
here today.
I really appreciate
all your time and the feedback.
Thank you.
Good luck, Haley.
