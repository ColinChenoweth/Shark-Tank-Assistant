Hi, Sharks.
I'm Jake Sendowski,
and this is my beautiful wife,
Michelle.
We're from
Los Angeles, California,
and we're here seeking $400,000
for 5% in our company.
Sharks,
this is our friend Jerry,
and, like us,
Jerry loves whipping up
some delicious
home?cooked meals.
Tonight,
he's making a big batch
of his grandma's
famous chili recipe.
But let's face it, Sharks.
There's no way Jerry
is going to eat all that chili
in just one sitting.
So what's he going to do?
He freezes some for later.
But what does
he freeze it in?
We all know that freezing
in plastic bags is a mess.
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
Corcoran:
No, don't do it.
And storing food in glassware
that can break in the freezer
is a nightmare
waiting to happen.
What if he only wants
to defrost a little bit,
but he froze it
in a gigantic container?
It's impossible.
Don't worry, Jerry,
we got you covered.
Introducing
Souper Cubes...
Souper Cubes.
...the best way to freeze food
in perfect portions.
Our silicone trays come in
four different sizes
so you can freeze
2 cups, 1 cup, 1/2 cup,
or even
2?tablespoon portions.
Souper Cubes has
the right container for you.
Just pour the food
into each compartment
up to the fill line,
pop on
the snug?fitting lid,
and stack them
on top of each other
to store
in the freezer.
The next time you're ready
for some of that chili again,
pop off the lid,
pop out a perfectly
portioned cube...
Pretty cool.
...heat it up,
and your food
is ready to go.
With Souper Cubes,
we're helping any home chef
reduce their food waste,
step up
their meal?prep game,
and store their food
efficiently in the freezer.
Sharks, who's super excited
to partner with us
and freeze out
the competition?
Sharks, in front of you guys,
you have examples
of some of our trays.
Souper Cubes!
Greiner: Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
I love the name.
Very excited
about the name.
Souper Cubes!
[ Laughs ]
Jake: Jerry's gonna take off
and go have some of that chili.
Yeah, we got to get rid
of him.
Michelle: Thanks, Jerry.
So, if you look at them,
there's a sturdy rim,
and so in each rim
there is steel
so you have confidence
walking to the freezer.
Right, you fill it up
with your food,
and then there's no way
the tray is going to fold
or collapse on you
when you take it to the freezer.
The plastic lid that you
put on top is very firm.
And so you can actually
stack them
even before they're frozen
in the freezer.
Do you have a patent
on the product?
Yeah,
so we have a design patent
that's been issued
on the original 1?cup tray,
and there's patents pending
on everything else.
Well, here's the question.
What are your sales?
Exactly.
In 2019,
which is the first full year
that we had
to sell Souper Cubes,
we ended the year
at $940,000.
Wow.       Wow.
Wow.                        Wow.
You got to hear about
this year.
Greiner: Okay.
So, this year, we've already
sold $1.6 million.
Yeah, Souper Cubes!
That's what
I'm talking about.
And we're on track
to make $3.3 million.
Greiner: Wow.
Last month, we sold
$330,000 worth of Souper Cubes.
Wow.
So tell us how.
So, it's a combination
of things.
We really benefited from
word of mouth of our customers,
and our customers love
sharing about Souper Cubes
on Instagram, Facebook,
Twitter,
and they are really
passionate advocates for us.
What do they cost to make?
Sure. So, the individual trays
sell for $19.95 retail.
Our cost, landed,
is around $3.80 per tray.
Scott: Okay.
Greiner: Nice.
Wow.
I like that margin.
What's the sales distribution
look like?
Is it all
direct?to?customer online?
So, about 78% of our sales
come from Amazon,
8% of our sales
come from our own website,
and then 14% of our sales
come from our retail partners.
We're in every single
Sur La Table store
in the United States.
Scott: Oh, nice.
We're also in every single
Williams Sonoma store
in the United States.
I built my business that way.
I mean, I got into Nordstrom.
I had no money for marketing.
Nordstrom said
they liked Kendra Scott,
and that immediately gave me,
you know, something to stand on,
because if they believed in me,
one of the top retailers
in the world,
it was able to allow me
to build my business,
and that business
fed to my online,
which is, like, the best,
so I think that's really smart
to still have some
very key wholesale partners.
Corcoran:
Why do you even need a Shark?
You seem to merrily be
rolling along.
We're looking for mentorship
from the Sharks.
I think some of the things that
we've realized as we've grown
is there are kind of
some bigger decisions
that we struggle
to make decisions on.
So, there was an opportunity
to potentially sell
to a very large retailer,
but it would totally change
the price point
for Souper Cubes.
And so we had a really
hard time thinking,
"Well, what would our
other retailers think?"
Cuban: Yeah.
"And is this better
long?term?"
Scott:
Smart. Very smart.
And I think
that kind of mentorship...
I mean,
as a mom, I love this.
And I ?? With my 7?year?old,
I made baby food for him,
and I would put it in these
little, tiny ice?cube trays
that were just plastic,
where I'm trying to get ??
I only need one
because he's a baby,
and I wanted to thaw
that one out,
and it was like ??
I had squash,
frozen squash,
all over my kitchen.
So I love this product.
I think you've really come up
with something brilliant.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I've heard enough.
I'd like to make an offer
and get the game going here.
and Kevin is interested
in Jake and Michelle's
food?storage product,
Souper Cubes.
I've heard enough.
I'd like to make an offer
and get the game going here.
I'd like to get behind this
as Chef Wonderful...
Michelle: Okay.
...with one specific goal
with you guys.
I'd like to get
direct?to?consumer sales
up to 30%.
I have many other food products
in my universe of companies,
and we try and share data
so we can reduce
our customer?acquisition costs.
I'm going to make an offer
in two directions
'cause I don't know how much
you care about your equity
versus another structure
I'm gonna offer you.
Okay.
I'll give you the $400,000.
Structure one is, I get
a $0.40 royalty on every unit,
but I only take 3% equity.
That's offer one.
The second offer ??
I'll do the $400,000 for 15%,
no royalty,
and I'll get behind it.
But those are two different ways
to go at it.
Yeah.
You know what?
I'm going to make an offer.
Okay.
I'll give you two offers,
but nothing fancy like Kevin
with the royalty, et cetera.
Just two straight?out offers.
I'll give you $400,000
for 10%,
or I'll give you $800,000
for 20%.
That's so greedy.
800K for 20%.
It's a lot of money.
I think ??
It's a lot of money.
I'll just be hon??
20% is a little bit more
than we anticipated
coming here today to give up,
and it's more than we discussed
with our partners.
So I think the first offer
of $400,000
would probably be a little bit
more appealing to us.
O'Leary: Why don't you like
my royalty deal,
which is only 3% equity?
Well, perpetual royalty
is the same as equity.
Perpetual royalty
is a bit ??
Yeah, it's the same
as equity, effectively.
What if I cap the royalty
on some return?
Say I left it at $0.40,
and after I get a million,
it goes away forever?
That's it. It's gone.
But I keep my 3%.
Guys,
let me clear things out.
Look, what you've accomplished
is great.
I love your name.
Best name we've ever had.
Oh, thank you so much.
Souper Cubes!
But it's just not
a fit for me.
Yeah.
Okay.
I mean, I think what you guys
have accomplished is incredible,
but for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thanks, though.
Thanks so much, Mark.
Thank you.
We really appreciate that.
Alright, well, I'm going to
tell you what I'm going to do.
Okay.
There's not one thing ??
I was sitting here
trying to think,
what could I find fault with?
Like, is there anything
that I could find fault with?
And it was ??
everything was a check, check,
check, check, check.
Like, love you,
love the product,
you did everything right,
you have great sales,
so guess what?
I am going to offer you
my golden ticket.
Okay.
I only do it once ??
I saw that one time.
I only do it once a season.
It is really gold.
You guys know what it is,
because I've now done it
for at least three years.
So what it means is,
is that you're the hero item
that I've seen this season
thus far.
Wow.
It's actually really gold.
And I will give you
the $400,000 for 5%.
That's what the winner
of the golden ticket gets.
I can't beat that offer.
I can't beat that offer.
I'm out.
That's amazing.
