Hi, Sharks.
My name is Elyce Billany.
I'm Nathan Billany,
and we're seeking $50,000
for 30% of our company,
Byoót.
Now, Sharks,
we want to take you
on a little trip
to Jamaica,
where a couple of years ago,
the idea for Byoót
was conceived.
Elyce over there
is struggling.
Ah!
One?piece swimsuits
are great and all,
but a dip in the pool
and using the loo right after ??
it's a disaster
waiting to happen.
[ Grunting ]
[ Laughter ]
Taking it off and pulling it
all the way back up again.
Aw, geez!
It's hot, it's sticky,
and you're definitely
going to end up
with a burrito roll
for a swimsuit.
The ladies know exactly
what I'm talking about.
Nate, this is the worst!
And it was
in that moment,
in that hot, sweaty
Jamaican bathroom,
that the idea popped
into Elyce's brain.
And, voilà,
the light bulb went off.
[ Chuckles ]
Introducing
the Byoót suit,
a fashionable
and revolutionary
one?piece swimsuit
that makes
going to the ladies' room
easier and more convenient
than ever before.
With just a couple
of cute buttons on each hip,
simply unbutton the sides
and get straight
down to business.
Sharks, our swimsuit
gives ladies the freedom
to confidently
strut their stuff,
all without the unspeakable
struggles of swimsuit removal.
Now, Sharks, who wants to join
our Byoót?iful business
and put an end to the world's
most annoying fashion problems?
And, Sharks,
we've set some samples
for you
to take a look at.
Thank you.
You are so brave
to be out here in a swimsuit,
and you look fabulous.
Well, thank you
very much.
Fabulous!
So, this is not just
for pregnant women ??
this is for any women.
Greiner:
Yeah. It doesn't really have
to do with the pregnancy bit.
It's wet and it's so hard
to get on and off.
Right.
Scott:
It is a real problem.
As a designer,
I'm really impressed
because you have
that sheer panel,
and it's kind of got
a retro vibe to it.
I mean, this is a gorgeous,
quality swimsuit.
Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Elyce, how long
did it take you
to get the business
up and running?
So, from the idea, I started
sketching on our Jamaica trip,
while he had
coconut drinks.
Literally right there.
But, remember, we live in the
swimsuit capital of the world,
in eastern Iowa.
Yeah, Iowa.
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
And did you have
some background in sketching
and designing anything?
No.
No, nothing.
Wow.
I grew up in a really
small town in Iowa,
didn't even really know that
business was an option for me.
But actually,
it was really when I met Nate ??
we had our first business,
we had a skincare company
that we were making soaps
in our basement ??
that I was like...
Literally,
in the basement.
I'm just like, "I can't do
anything else with my life
other than, like, create things
and run a business."
Be your own boss.
Scott: I love that.
I grew up in a little town
in Wisconsin.
Same thing.
I didn't see anyone that
I could role?model myself after.
So kudos to you.
Thank you.
Have you sold any yet?
Yes.
10,000, give or take.
$10,000?
$10,000.
I want to set the stage
for you.
You were talking about how you
liked the mesh panel so much.
Well, when I first received
the bulk order...
So, I started sending them out,
but I quickly realized
that the suits didn't fit
as universally
as I had hoped
that they would.
And so I had to figure out
what to do.
So, when I got them,
we found out that the torsos
were just a little too short.
So, actually,
they didn't come with the mesh.
?Oh, wow!
?Whoa!
Yeah, there you go.
Problem, solution.
So, at that point,
when I found out
that I needed to do
something different,
I did halt on any launch,
any sales.
So, we had about
$6,000 in preorders
and then about
another $4,000
of just people
that just found us randomly.
And I'll be honest,
at the beginning,
I would send them out
and I would get
quite a few returns.
But the cool thing about that
is I found out
that there's other ways
to sell online.
So, I did a virtual fitting
where they will set their time
and whether they want to do it
on the phone or Zoom.
I get on and I'm like,
"Hey, do you like more coverage
on the bust?
What do you think
about the back?"
Do you have a sense
of what your demographic is?
How old are those women?
Yes. So, I really think
our demographic
is more the 40?plus.
And I didn't know that
when I designed it.
The reason I ask that
is I invest in a business
called Raising Wild,
and I've learned quite a bit
about bathing suits.
It's one of the toughest
darn businesses in the world ??
It is. 100%.
...because there are so many
different length trunks
in a one?piece space.
Mm?hmm.
And I also found that
they could never guess right
how many of each SKU
for each size.
So they always were stuck
with doing limited runs,
which costs the fabric
much more.
So, from all of that
experience,
I learned that it's a tough,
tough business.
It's a tough business.
I feel like it's not the kind
of business that has room
for a third partner anyway.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
So, what does it cost you
to create this suit?
And what are you
selling it for?
Yep.
So, they cost between ??
Originally, they cost
between $29 and $35.
To make?
To make.
To <i>make?</i>
And we've experimented
with the retail price.
Small batch.
Very small batch.
Scott: Right.
We'd like to get the cost
of goods down somewhere
in that ballpark
of 16 to 20 bucks.
Okay, and you sell it
for...?
We sell it for ??
So, this is the other thing.
This last year,
I've been testing prices.
So, I did start ??
we did like $59 to $120.
Just to dabble
and see what hits.
And what I found out
was the younger women would
gear more towards that $59,
and then the older demographic,
the 40?plus,
that demographic
is willing to pay.
It's adorable,
and you're fabulous,
but I don't think it's the right
investment for me.
So, I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
We really appreciate it.
Guys, look,
I'm not the one
to speak to the buttons
or not buttons,
but what I <i>can</i> speak to is,
in this environment,
where people
are staying at home,
people want to be interactive
and have that personal touch
and be guided through
a selection,
particularly like this.
Absolutely.
That's your grand slam.
Yep.
Right?
Because you don't have to sink
all your money
into all that inventory
if you can just brag,
"I'm the swimsuit whisperer.
Let me get online with you
on a Zoom call,
on a personal call."
And then once you get
a base of customers
who can refer other customers,
then someone is gonna come
to you and say, "You know what?
We'd like to put it
on our website.
We'd like to work with you."
That's how you build a brand
like Kendra has done,
but it's not a fit for me.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
You have picked a sector
that it's almost impossible
to make money in,
for all the reasons
you've heard here.
Luckily, there's a lot
of barns in Iowa.
Find a nice barn,
and just go shoot it.
I'm out.
Do you know how many people
told me that I couldn't do this?
Do you know how many people
said, you know,
"There's thousands of jewelry
designers out there ??
What makes you special?"
I always love it when somebody
tells me I can't do something.
So take that
and use it as fire.
You need to be able to take
a 360 approach, though.
My first business
was a hat company,
and I thought the whole world
was gonna wear hats again
like it was 1940.
That didn't happen.
After five years of trying
to make this business work,
I had to close it.
I failed. Right?
And the thing
that <i>was</i> working,
I was making jewelry
in this little hat shop,
and that's what
was selling every day.
My answer to my future
was in front of me,
but I was so laser?focused ??
Is this a nice way of saying
take it behind the barn?
No, I'm saying, look,
you've got to start somewhere.
And this is
a beautiful product,
but I think you need
a little bit more time.
I think you're gonna need
a little bit more sales.
But I want to be able
to help you,
so here's what
I'm gonna do.
I don't want to take
a bunch of equity,
so I'm gonna give you
a loan.
I'm gonna do
a three?year note, okay?
$50,000.
I'd like 10% interest.
And I still want
a 5% equity position for that ??
What a savage.
...for my advice.
Alright? Kendra Scott.
What a savage.
Corcoran:
That's more than fair.
And you have Kendra Scott
as your...
That's not very Shark?y.
I've never seen such
bathing suit greed before.
No, I mean, you should just
say yes right away,
'cause that's a gift.
I learned from the best!
That's a gift. If you even
hesitate ?? Just say yes.
Don't say yes.
That's debt.
Elyce: So, Kendra's from
Wisconsin, I'm from Iowa.
It's just the perfect
connection.
I am so amazed
by what she has built,
and we could not be
more grateful and more excited
to have Kendra Scott
as our partner.
I loved them.
It is impossible
to make money with
what they're doing.
You know what? I got a loan.
They're gonna pay me back.
I couldn't take
30% of their company.
That's just wrong.
No, you should've
taken 80%.
Yes!
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it, y'all.
I can't.
This is
what you did.
They're from Iowa.
? Ah, ah, ah, ah ?
No, no.
Just think about,
every day,
they're just beating themselves
up with these buttons.
