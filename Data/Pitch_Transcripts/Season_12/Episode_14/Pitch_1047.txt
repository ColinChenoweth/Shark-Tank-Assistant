Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tyla?Simone Crayton.
And I'm her mother,
Monique Crayton,
and we're from
Houston, Texas.
Ooh!
Sharks,
we have a secret.
[ Chuckles ]
Together:
Sauce!
Introducing the award?winning
Sienna Sauce.
It's delicious.
So good,
it was even featured at
the World Food Championships.
Sharks, when I was 8 years old,
my favorite wing place closed.
And I loved their sauce
so much,
I couldn't imagine life
without it.
So I tried
to re?create it,
but ended up coming up
with something even better.
Sienna Sauce was created
in my kitchen,
has grown into a line
of three flavors ??
tangy, lemon pepper,
and spicy.
It's gluten?free,
has no high?fructose corn syrup,
and can be used
as a marinade, dip, glaze...
...or even
your favorite new...
...put?that?on?everything
sauce.
And, Sharks,
that's just the beginning.
We're seeking $100,000
for 10% of our company,
and we'd love your help.
But first,
let us sauce up your life.
We're gonna ask you to start,
from left to right,
with our famous
Sienna wings.
That's where we got started
in our kitchen in 2017.
Corcoran: Mmm.
Then we will have
our French toast bacon jam.
Wow.
So, the great thing
about our sauce,
it's also an ingredient.
Yeah.
So we use our tangy
to create a bacon jam.
Wow.
I love the bacon jam.
I'm still on the tangy,
but it's sweet
and it's got
a little kick.
Yeah.
Yes, yes.
Mmm! It's so good.
Next, you'll have
the roasted lemon pepper
with Brussels sprouts
and potatoes.
That's our most
popular flavor.
Mmm!
Then next, you're gonna go
to the smoke sauce.
Mmm!
That's our new sauce
that we're introducing.
For her birthday next month,
we're introducing the ??
Happy birthday.
Yes, for her smoke sauce.
How old are you?
I'm 16.
Oh, my goodness!
So smoky and delicious.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
Mmm!
And then, last, you have
your shrimp cocktail.
And we saved the spicy
for last
because we didn't want you
to mess up your palate
before you get
to that spice.
Whoa! Ah, ah! Whew!
O'Leary: Oh, that has a kick.
That's hot. That's hot.
Yes.
It's delish.
I like it, though.
Corcoran: Wow, you need
a hose on that one.
[ Laughing ] Yeah.
They're not from Texas.
They can't handle it.
Whoo!
Where are you selling
your product now?
So, right now,
we're in 68 stores.
?Wow.
?Wow.
People buy it online, and
we ship all over the country.
54% of our sales
are online,
and 30% of our sales
are in stores.
Wow.
And what are your sales?
So, lifetime sales
are $255,000.
Mm?hmm.
Greiner: Wow.
Last year,
we did $171,000,
and this year so far,
we've done $84,000.
That's a lot of sauce.
[ Laughing ] Yes.
Where are you manufacturing?
What are we looking at
from your cost of goods
to where you're selling it?
Yes. So, currently, we
are manufacturing in Houston.
Our retail price
for our product
is $9.95 online.
Greiner: Now, I have to go back
for a minute.
You said
you were 16 years old?
Yes, I created the sauce
when I was 8.
So, finally, my mom said
I could bottle it.
So I initially started
the company when I was 14,
and we started
with a wing place.
So we sold wings
out of our house
for a whole year,
and we made $50,000
selling the wings
out of our house.
That's what's up!
That's awesome.
That is incredible.
And then end of 2018
is when we actually started
selling the sauce.
And so, with that,
we stopped the wing place
and we were like,
"Since you guys love
our wings so much,
you buy our sauce
and you make it yourself.
And not only is it good
for wings, but you can use it
on all of these
amazing foods, as well."
Corcoran: I don't get
why you stopped it, though.
Why stop it if it was dragging
customers in to try your sauce?
So, when she was ready
to bring the sauce to market,
the smarter thing for us to do
in our business model
was to bottle
the sauce first.
It was the best way
to get her started,
because we couldn't afford
at the time
to put the money
into a brick?and?mortar
or food trucks.
But we still have that base.
We still have
that customer base,
and they still love us.
You said 68 stores.
Yes.
So, currently,
we are in Wegmans.
Yeah.
Okay.
Greiner: Oh, wow.
That's a big accomplishment.
Yes, so we're in 10 stores
on the East Coast in Wegmans.
We're a test market
with the ??
Tyla, you're amazing.
Thank you.
How are you 16?
This is incredible.
Were you at 8 years old going,
"I want to make products"?
So, it kind of came from me
watching this show.
And when I was 8 years old,
me and my mom,
we had just came
from being homeless.
And we moved into
this one?bedroom apartment,
and I started watching
"Shark Tank."
And that's when I started
seeing entrepreneurship
as an option.
And as I got older and was
finding out more about myself,
I decided that entrepreneurship
should be the route for me,
and I started
my business.
That's awesome.
And through our company,
we actually give back a lot.
I knew that
me selling sauce
would be an inspiration
to the youth.
And that's why I speak
almost four times,
three times a month,
speaking to the youth
and telling them that
entrepreneurship is an option.
Corcoran: Amazing.
Greiner: Wow.
I mean, Monique, you must be
beaming with pride.
Good for you.
That's awesome.
Monique:
I am beyond proud.
She inspires me
every day.
Corcoran: Of course.
And I'm just always
in awe with her.
So, yes.
When you went homeless
for a period of time,
how did that happen?
So, we were actually living
in a very nice brownstone.
And the woman who was
renting it to us,
her son was coming home.
She wanted the house
for him.
And so we had to leave,
and at that time,
my mom,
she didn't have a job.
And she made a promise
to me, like,
that we would never
be homeless again.
And that just really taught me
about her hustle,
because she sold baskets
for baby showers,
anything that she could
possibly do.
Way to go.
And then when we got
the apartment,
she got a waiter job
right by my school.
So every day she could come
pick me up from school,
and I would sit there
and wait
until she got off of work
and do my homework.
And that's how we were able
to keep the apartment.
?That's unbelievable.
?Wow. What an amazing mom.
Thank you.
Yes. Thank you.
O'Leary: So, the great news
about this sector
is the condiments
and the sauce business
is in the billions
of dollars.
The bad news is
it's really competitive.
Right.
And so to get
national rollout,
you have to be working with
a distributor in this category.
That's why we're here.
We're here for a Shark.
Yeah.
Because we know that if you make
the call, it's gonna happen.
And I'm gonna tell you why.
One, I'm a Texas girl.
Two, my first employee
was my mom.
And my mom and I sat
and ticketed and carded jewelry
on my dining room table,
and we put every dollar we made
back into that business.
I'm sitting in front of you,
somebody who built
a billion?dollar brand
out of their ??
literally, an extra bedroom
of their house, okay?
And I think you have
an amazing, amazing product.
But I'm a little concerned
where we are with the valuation.
$100,000 for 10% ??
I don't think you guys
are quite there yet.
Right?
But you need me.
So I'm gonna give you
your $100,000,
but I want 20%
of the company.
Greedy.
Just say yes.
And I can help you
with the distributors,
I can help you
with the shelf space.
I can help you
with all those things
because it is
in my wheelhouse.
Hey, guys ??
And the most
important thing
is I know I can help you
build this brand.
Hey, guys, I'm out.
Barbara,
are you in?
I'm out, too.
Lori?
I'm out.
Kevin?
I want to talk
about valuation.
Ohh, Kevin!
No, Kevin!
Oh, my gosh.
O'Leary: She just offered you
a half?a?million valuation.
I wouldn't offer you that.
I'm not sure yet
what you're worth,
because you don't have enough
sell?through data.
You don't have
much distribution yet.
And let me make it easy
for you.
I'm out.
I would love
to counter you.
Um, would you
be willing ??
There's no other Shark,
and you're gonna counter her?
You're gonna counter me?
I mean, my 10%
that I'm gonna give
on top of the 10%
you're asking for
is, one,
you got a Texas woman.
I mean, this is
Mr. Wonderful ??
you got Wonder Woman
on your team, alright?
And I love your product, and I
can help you make this happen.
And also, because
I went through this,
so I'm gonna save you
so much money and time.
