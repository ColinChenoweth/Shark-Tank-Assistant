Gassen:
I sat the kids down.
I said,
"No more eating out.
No more clothes
for two years.
No more nothing."
Unbelievable.
The future
of your company
is truly in the balance
right now.
I think I've taken
this business
as far as I can
really take it.
Hi, Sharks, I'm Nita.
And I'm Judy.
We're from
Mandeville, Louisiana,
and we're seeking
$150,000
for 10% of our company,
The Better Bedder.
Sharks, it's hard
to find sheets
that fit your mattress
perfectly.
They're either way too baggy,
or they're too tight,
and the fitted sheet pops off
of the corner of the mattress.
And putting on sheets
is hard.
Mattresses weigh a ton,
and they're too heavy
for seniors
or those
with disabilities.
So, what if we told you
that there's a product
that solves these problems
and a whole lot more?
It's the Better Bedder ??
the greatest bed?making
product ever invented!
The Better Better
is a giant headband
that wraps around
the sides of your mattress.
You put it on once,
and it becomes
a part of your mattress
for the lifetime
of your mattress.
And putting on sheets
is now...
Both: Fast, easy, neat!
Show 'em, Nita!
I will!
[ Chuckling ]
With the Better Bedder,
there's no more lifting
the heavy mattress,
and there's no more tucking
underneath the mattress.
You simply take
the Better Bedder,
flip it down,
put your fitted sheet in,
and flip the
Better Bedder back up.
That's it.
It's that easy.
Nita, show them
the top sheet!
I will!
Take the Better Bedder,
flip it down.
Put your top sheet in,
flip the Better Bedder
back up.
Did you see her lift
that heavy mattress?
Judges: No.
No, you didn't,
'cause she has a...
All: Better Bedder.
That's right.
And wait, there's more.
You can store
your book...
Cuban:
Oh, there you go.
Your phone...
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
...or your glasses.
Wow.
So, Sharks,
who wants to join us
and put a Better Bedder
on every bed in the world?
[ Laughs ]
And there is a Better Bedder
in front of each of you.
How did you
discover this idea?
We can thank
Judy's lazy son for this.
He actually came home
from college,
and he started sleeping
on her good couch.
And she's like,
"Why are you sleeping
on my couch?"
He said, "'Cause
the new bed you bought,
the sheets are horrible
to make the bed every day.
I'd just as soon
sleep on the couch."
And so, she called me
and said,
"Hey, can you help me
think of a way
to make the bed
easier?"
And I know from working
with Judy for 15 years
that when
she's on a mission,
we gotta figure
something out.
Judy's on a mission.
Yes. [ Laughs ]
I like that.
Right.
And within six months,
we sold our first
Better Bedder.
And you worked together
for 15 years?
Yes.
And what were you
doing then?
We have worked for 15 years
in the insurance industry.
I'm actually a lawyer
by education,
and I practiced law
for a little while,
and then I went and worked
in the insurance industry.
So, this is not
a full?time job for you?
It is.
I am actually putting in
my two weeks' notice,
and I'm cashing out
my 401(k).
So, sometimes
people's sheets,
especially at the end,
are longer.
You're saying
no matter the length,
it easily
tucks down in?
Yes, ma'am. Yep.
Yes, yes.
That's the beauty
of the Better Bedder.
Any sheets from any store
fit perfectly
'cause you only have to
tuck down about three inches.
So, ladies, quick question
on the Better Bedder.
The issue is,
I'm always going to see
a white band
around the mattress.
If I'm a fashionista
and I'm, you know,
designing a bedroom,
I'm worried about
the color.
What if I don't want white?
Yeah, I was gonna
ask the same thing.
Does it come
in colors?
We do make it in colors,
but white is
our primary seller.
We have sold
a ton of these.
We've only sold it
for a little over
a year and a half.
Well, before we get to
how many you sold ??
'cause that was obviously
a <i>blanket</i> statement ??
what do you make it for,
and what do you sell it for?
The average cost
of goods sold is $33 ??
I mean, $33.50.
Cuban: That's a lot.
To make it or sell it?
To make it.
It's made in the USA.
It's $33? Wow.
$33.
Dang.
And the average
sales price is $63.50.
Daymond: Okay.
O'Leary: Okay, ladies.
I think there's an issue
on production costs,
because that sounds
very expensive...
Really expensive.
Cuban: Yes.
...for, you know, basically,
a rim to a mattress.
I'm gonna tell you ??
this is a bad time.
COVID came, and so
it was hard to get material.
It was definitely hard
to get elastic.
The material we use on
the corner is more expensive.
And this is an industry
that's completely new to us.
We didn't know how to go
to China or to order fabric.
We're normally in
the insurance industry.
I could sell you
a policy right now.
[ Laughter ]
In the business jungle,
there's only one king,
and it's called sales.
Yes.
Yep.
What have you sold?
We have sold,
year to date,
$476,000.
Whoa!
?Wow.
?Year to date?
2020.
All right!
So, you could potentially get to
$1 million this year.
Oh, absolutely.
We think we'll finish
at $1 million this year.
Yippee?yi?yo?ki?yay.
Cuban: So, how are you
promoting this?
How are people
finding you?
Well, first of all, we have
had no media or publicity
other than the small town
she grew up in.
Lillie, Louisiana,
did an article about
"Small?town Girl Invents
The Better Bedder."
We have not paid
any influencers.
We have done Facebook
video ads ourselves,
Nita at the corner
of the bed,
me with the iPhone
with terrible lighting.
Those were our
original videos.
We got over a million
views on those.
We got a million views,
and it has been a hit.
Tell me about you.
I was adopted
when I was 5,
so I always knew
that, um [Laughs]
struggles and challenges
can be overcome.
I'll give you an example ??
When I got divorced,
I left with a suitcase
and clothes, and that's it.
Not a fork, a knife,
a spoon ?? nothing.
And immediately,
I went into debt,
and I said,
"You know what?"
I sat the kids down,
and I said,
"You know, we can't
live like this.
We're never gonna get ahead
if we don't do this."
So I said,
"No more eating out.
If we do, it's 99 cents.
No more clothes
for two years.
No more nothing.
We're moving into
an apartment,
and we're gonna
share rooms,
and we're gonna do this
for two years."
And we did,
and in two years,
we were out of debt,
we had a house,
and we had
money in the bank.
Corcoran: My God.
And so, I do that
with everything I do.
I would like you
to tell that five times
to every woman
who's stuck somewhere
and is too afraid
to move out ??
kind of feels ashamed
of themselves
that they can't
make that move.
Unbelievable.
Listen, you guys
are terrific.
I deal with
so many lawyers,
and you're the first one
I've ever liked.
[ Laughter ]
Like, that's fantastic.
Well, thank you.
I got it in 90 seconds.
Bingo.
I know what it does.
But do I want to be
in the bed skirt business?
It's not a space
I need to be in.
Well, you know what,
let me just say this before ??
Guys, I'm out, but not 'cause
I don't love you guys.
Thank you.
You're just a joy.
Guys, let me help
clear things, as well.
Look, I did an analysis
at one point in my career
where I spent about
an hour a week making my bed,
and then I extrapolated
that out and figured,
"That's 365 hours a year."
And so, I vowed that I kept
my sheets and bedding clean,
but I would
never make my bed.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
Judy and Nita, I want to
make the first offer,
if I might, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna give you
three reasons
why you should choose me
as a Shark, 'cause I imagine
you're gonna see
other offers here today.
Number one, I'm going to
bring down your cost to $20
if you want to keep it
in the United States.
If you're willing to go out,
I'll bring it down to $11.
Secondly, I am great
at driving public relations.
My Comfy product that is
making $65 million a year
after being in business
less than three years
is making the money
predominantly because
I am great
at creating publicity.
And lastly, when you go on ??
Oh, God.
No, one more.
I always pick
the same kind of people ??
great people
that I could trust,
people that
love each other.
And so, you would wind up
being very happy
in the nucleus family
that I put together.
I'm going to give you
the $150,000 for 20%.
The reason I need 20% is,
I don't think
about my investments
if they're less than 20% ??
honest to God ??
no matter how nice you are.
And you don't even have to
answer me right now.
I wish I was a son of a bitch
who could say,
"You must answer me,
or I'm out."
What are you
trying to say?
But I'm trying to say
you should take it from me,
but if you want to shop
other offers, certainly do that.
What are you gonna do?
for 20% of Nita and Judy's
bed?making product,
Better Bedder.
Okay, I'll share with you
what I think.
Against all odds ??
not having a lot of money,
having a lot of debt ??
you said, "I'm gonna
take charge of my life.
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm gonna be happy."
Because money
doesn't buy happiness.
That's what a strong woman does,
and I love this concept.
It's very visual.
I think this could be
a great QVC item.
I also think it could be
a good infomercial item.
So, my offer's a little
Sharkier than Barb's.
I'm gonna offer $150,000,
but for 25%.
And that's because
I'm gonna have to
really get down in there
and do a lot of work with you.
All right.
Okay.
Okay, guys,
here's what I think.
I think my other two Sharks
are brilliant,
but, you know, they're just
such small thinkers.
I mean, all of us
have manufactured,
but I've been
doing it the longest.
Enough.
Spit it out.
I see this being
a commercial product
that I take to AAHOA ??
Asian American Hotel Owners.
They own about 51%
of hotels in the country,
and I think that this will be
saving them, their staff,
time and energy,
as well as their health.
Second of all, I work with
Purple, Casper,
and Leesa Mattress.
I think there's
something there.
So I will offer you
the same $150,000 for 25%.
Okay.
Thank you, thank you.
Wow.
Wow.
You've got three
amazing offers.
We do.
You didn't see
that coming.
Didn't.
No. [ Laughs ]
What are you gonna do?
Um...
we ?? we would
like to counter,
because we were hoping
not to give up that much.
Is anyone willing
to go to 18%?
I'll take that deal.
Corcoran:
I'll take that deal.
You got a deal.
You got a deal.
Wait.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Wait. I sa??
I took it first.
Whoo!
No, no, no, we both said it,
so choose between us.
I took it first.
There's no rules
in the Tank.
Let me flip a coin.
You want me
to flip a coin?
There are no rules in the Tank,
but I did take it first.
Let me say one thing.
Sure.
I'll go to 15%.
Whoo!
Oh, my goodness.
Well, listen,
I will just ??
I don't want to
pressure you.
I would love to be
your partner.
You can get money
all day long...
Right.
...but I think what's
important is the value
that comes to you
for that money.
I was willing
to do the 18.
I'm good at that.
Can you also get the
manufacturing costs
down for us, as well?
Oh, my God. That's all
I've done my whole life.
All of us can.
I've manufactured
over 1,000 products.
Why would you
even go with her?
I don't get it.
Am I missing something?
We love you, Barbara ??
That's always a bad start.
I know, and that's why
I didn't want to
start off like that.
We love you, Lori.
You got a deal.
Yay!
Ohh, I don't get it.
Whoo!
Super, super
excited, ladies.
Yes!
Thank you!
It's really smart.
Oh, thank you so much!
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
We did it!
Whoo!
We did it!
We did it!
Lori can do
infomercials.
She can do...
[ Laughs ]
Yes.
Lori can
get us on QVC,
and she can get our
manufacturing costs down.
And we just think Lori was
the right partner for us.
Yes, yes.
Although we love
Barbara and Daymond.
We're so excited.
I don't want to
hear from you,
'cause you're the winner,
and I don't like you.
But what did I
do wrong?
You waited ??
You tried to be cool
by letting everybody else
get in and make an offer.
Corcoran: I mean,
I played too nice.
Yeah.
I should have just
closed the deal.
I'm pretty annoyed.
