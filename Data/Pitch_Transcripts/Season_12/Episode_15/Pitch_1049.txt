My name is Lisa Baronoff.
Lisa, what do you
sell one for?
The size extra?small
sells for $29.99
up to $39.99.
What does it cost
to make it?
So, it ranges from $4.40
up to $5.20.
I mean, I'm always fascinated
by a new product.
I mean, tell me about you.
So, I grew up
in South Africa.
My mother was
a very well?known,
very successful
fashion designer,
O'Leary: Okay, Lisa,
let me take a stab at it.
Yeah, but then don't invest.
If I may have the floor
for a moment.
Huh?
Don't invest then.
Wait, sorry.
What did you say?
Daymond ??
I said, "Don't invest
if you don't think" ??
Thank you for
answering my question.
I'm out.
Okay.
O'Leary: Okay...
Thanks.
I, too, have a problem
with the valuation...
Yes.
...but people are spending
a lot of time
with their pets.
I'm gonna make you
two offers
so you can choose
to solve my problem
in two different ways.
Mm?hmm.
Number one ??
I'll do the $150,000...
for 5%, but I'm putting
a royalty on it of $2.70 ??
'cause I've done
the math in my head
of how many units
you're selling ??
until I get
my $150,000 back
Lisa, you just
figured that out.
But you have two offers,
not one.
You choose
between the two.
Would you consider
doing 10%
for $150,000?
I can't give up more
than 10% of my company.
Sure, you can.
You own the company.
I know I do, but I
wouldn't want to do ??
Well, that's why
I made you two offers.
Stick with your guns.
I wouldn't give up
a percentage more than 10%.
No, no, no,
but I'm ??
Look, commensurate
with the risk,
I mean, 5% ??
What risk?
Explain what the risk is.
There's no risk
in this business.
Well, then, why didn't you
make an offer?
Because it's not
my cup of tea,
but you're saying
there's a big risk.
So it's easy for you
to say that, Barbara,
when you're not putting
a dime on the table.
Look, I'm giving you
two ways to go.
Now you say ??
I'm gonna say neither
of them work for me.
I don't want to give
money up in perpetuity.
Well, then, we have
nothing to talk about.
Cuban:
Good for you, Lisa.
Then we have nothing
to talk about.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you guys.
Take care.
Congratulations on
a great company, Lisa.
Greiner: Lisa, congrats.
Well done.
Thank you so much.
Thank you guys. Appreciate it.
Daymond: Congratulations
on your business.
