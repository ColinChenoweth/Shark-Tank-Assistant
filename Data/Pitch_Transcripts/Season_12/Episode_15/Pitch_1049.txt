Duane:
Let's come together.
We came here to do business
with the great whites.
Daymond: No way in the world
you thought you were
coming in here
and getting a deal.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Duane,
and I'm from Prince George's
County, Maryland.
And I'm Danita.
And we're here
seeking $300,000
for 10% of our company,
Everything Legendary.
We all know the benefits
of a vegan lifestyle,
like lowering
your blood pressure
or lowering your risk
of heart disease.
But the problem with
a plant?based diet is,
sometimes you just want to
sink your teeth into a burger
that actually
tastes like a burger.
But most
plant?based burgers
are created by scientists
in a lab, like this geek.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Sharks.
I'm no scientist.
I'm Chef Jumoke Jackson,
the Head Chef
behind Everything Legendary,
with a plant?based burger
that's made in a real kitchen
by a real chef ?? me.
Everything Legendary
is the wagyu
of the
plant?based meats!
It's the caviar.
It's the Kobe beef.
It is the best!
At Everything Legendary,
we use the highest quality
hemp protein
and a proprietary
spice blend
that focuses on taste,
texture, and appearance.
It is juicy,
it is flavorful,
and most importantly,
it is healthy!
So, Sharks, who's ready
to join this team?
Who's ready to become...
All: Legendary!
Sharks, what we've
prepared for you,
is our premium
Legendary Burger
along with our gourmet
Legendary sauce.
Enjoy.
Duane, I couldn't hear
a word you said.
[ Laughter ]
Can you say it again?
Duane's mom has lupus,
and unfortunately,
my mom passed away from cancer.
And we tried to get her
on a healthy diet.
My mom just
didn't like it.
I called up Danita.
I called up Chef Jackson.
I said, "Guys,
let's come together.
Let's do
something great."
And we came up with
Everything Legendary.
Her mom was one of our
biggest supporters.
This is one of her
favorite shows.
That's how I know Honey's
looking down on us right now.
She told us we were
going to be on "Shark Tank."
That's the crazy part.
She was in the hospital.
She was watching
"Shark Tank,"
and she was like, "You need
to get yourself together,
because y'all are
going on 'Shark Tank.'"
[ Laughs ]
This burger is
priced 30% more
than the big
competitors,
but do you get
any pushback on that?
The reason why
the price is higher
is because this is
the wagyu.
This is the Kobe beef.
[ Laughs ] The wagyu.
It sounds like you're right at
the very premium top price.
It's a premium
plant?based product.
There's wagyu,
there's Kobe beef.
That's what we stand by.
I can't race them
to the bottom.
One of the largest
vegan restaurants
based down in Atlanta ??
they tried to buy us
early on,
but they weren't
any Sharks.
I don't want to make deals
with stingrays.
We came here to do business
with the great whites.
We want a Shark!
O'Leary: Break down
the numbers for me.
We've been doing this
since June 2019.
We had $165,000
worth of sales.
We lost a couple of months,
obviously, because of COVID.
$53,000 of that
was profit.
In a COVID world,
as we've found all our
Shark companies doing,
what you care about
is customer acquisition.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you have any
data on that?
Yeah, so, to this day,
we have spent no money
on customer acquisition.
This has all been
word of mouth.
This has been
bootstrapped.
This has been social ??
Jones: Pop?ups.
You haven't bought
a single digital ad?
No, we have not.
No.
How did you do
last month in sales?
Last month, we did
$15,500 in sales.
We had 100% growth
from our first month
when we started.
You know,
what you're asking for
is $300,000 for 10%.
You're saying, basically,
it's worth $3 million.
Why do you feel
it's worth that value?
So, 4% of the country
right now are vegans.
However, 8% of black people
are vegans.
What does the African?American
part play in it?
Is it just like we're making it
for a certain community
because we want to
reduce diabetes
and hypertension
and stuff like that?
Is that ?? Is that
what you're saying
you're positioning it at?
Yeah, I can say that
that's where we started.
I mean, like,
that's who we are.
Jones: Yeah.
But it is growing
to people from all
different nationalities.
But your pricing
is premium...
Yes.
...and plant?based products
are not just for vegans.
So, guys, I'm not
wrong when I say
yours is 10 bucks
and the competitors' are 3.
There's a <i>big</i>
difference there.
Yes.
Your price difference
is a huge challenge, honestly.
I think you have
a lot of work to do,
so for that reason,
I'm going to go out.
Okay.
Can I ask
how much money
you have invested
in the company?
So, we started off
with $17,000
that came out our own
personal savings.
Since then, we took out
a credit card for $30,000,
so a total of $47,000.
Oh, damn.
Have you ever been
in retail?
Yes, we started off
doing our pop?up,
so that accounted
for 80% of our sales.
Daymond: 80?
Yes.
All right, so, then,
the rest is follow?throughs,
because after they tasted it
at the pop?up, they ??
And then we did retail,
so 2.5% was retail,
2.5% was grocery,
and then the other 15%
now was online,
and everything shifted
to be online.
You were selling in grocery
in the frozen section?
Yes, we were.
We were selling
16 cases a week.
Greiner: Wow!
So, 16 cases a week
is how much money?
So, that accumulated
for $30,000 in our sales.
So, what was the price
that you were selling
to them the four?pack?
We were selling it
to them for $10,
and they were
selling it for $17.
And your cost
was 10 bucks?
Yes.
So you were
making no money.
Exactly.
No, we were
getting killed.
Ohh, it was such a great story
until that part.
O'Leary: The product's
great, okay?
This is the best burger
I've ever had...
Thank you so much.
...that's plant?based.
Here's the problem
I got with it.
For me to play with you,
just to get in the game,
I got to put up $300,000.
This is a crazy valuation
for where you are right now.
I wish you had some idea
of customer acquisition cost,
but I don't know that here,
all right?
I think the mistake for me ??
You asked for 300K.
I'm out.
So, guys, have you done
anything with local delivery?
'Cause, to me,
if this was in Dallas...
Jones: Mm?hmm.
...and I pulled up Uber Eats
or DoorDash or whatever,
I would buy this
all day, every day.
In the beginning,
we were delivering it
fresh to the customers,
but now ??
Yeah, 'cause if you could
train other chefs,
you would be just killing that
out of cloud kitchens.
So look, guys,
I'll make you an offer,
but here's the things
I want to test, okay?
Okay.
Yep.
I get why
you pivoted, right?
You guys have had to
chase the money to stay alive.
That's just the reality
in the real world, right?
Because frozen's
so expensive,
you can continue
to do that,
but that's gonna be
really hard to scale.
Jones: Yes.
But I think
short?term path to money
is local kitchens,
working with DoorDash
and Uber Eats.
Yes.
I think people are
gonna love these.
So I'll give you
the $300,000.
But because there's
so much work, I want 25%.
Myko: That's what
I'm talking about, man!
That's what I'm
talking about!
We did it!
Thanks, guys.
Thanks, guys.
Jones:
Thank you so much!
Congrats.
Greiner:
Congrats, guys.
That's what
I'm talking about!
Yes, we did it!
Yes!
Whoo!
Believe in your dreams.
Whew.
They're gon' tell you no
a million and one times.
Keep going.
We'd have been
broke?broke.
I done had a house
repossessed.
I done had a car repossessed
on the way to going to church
before.
Believe in your dreams!
[ Laughs ]
