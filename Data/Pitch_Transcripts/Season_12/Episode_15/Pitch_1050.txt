My name is Lisa Baronoff.
I'm from New York City,
and I'm seeking $150,000
in exchange for 5% equity
in my company, Walkee Paws.
So, a couple of years ago,
when my dog got sick
from ingesting
snowmelt chemicals
on the sidewalks
of Manhattan,
my vet recommended
he wear booties.
The problem was,
he hated them.
It was incredibly
challenging
trying to get four
individual booties
onto his squirming paws.
He was so uncomfortable...
[ Laughter ]
...and invariably,
one of them would fall off
and get lost
during our walk.
It was a frustrating
experience, to say the least,
and I knew there had to be
a better way.
And that is why
I created Walkee Paws.
Walkee Paws are the world's
first doggie legging
and a better bootie.
Why?
Because they're designed
to stay on.
All four leggings
connect to each other
over your dog's back
so you will never
lose a bootie again.
[ Laughs ]
Our waterproof rubber booties
protect your dog's paws
from harmful chemicals,
hot pavements, rain, and snow
while preventing dirt,
germs, and allergens
from entering your home.
And best of all, Sharks,
they are super easy
to get on.
You just slip
your dog's paws
into each of the four
paw openings.
Connect with the adjustable
connector over the back
for a perfect,
customizable fit.
It's as easy
as one, two, three.
So, which one
of you Sharks
would like to make
a doggone good investment
and join our
Walkee Paws pack?
Can you do this
with the dog?
Can you carry it
with this?
No, no.
[ Laughter ]
I would not recommend that
at all, Kevin, no, no, no.
Lisa, what do you
sell one for?
The size extra?small
sells for $29.99
up to $39.99.
What does it cost
to make it?
So, it ranges from $4.40
up to $5.20.
I mean, I'm always fascinated
by a new product.
I mean, tell me about you.
So, I grew up
in South Africa.
My mother was
a very well?known,
very successful
fashion designer,
and it was really fascinating
living with her
because I saw her
grow her business
from literally
our living room
into a huge,
big corporation.
She was just eccentric.
She'd do whatever
she wanted to do,
say whatever
she wanted to say.
People thought she was
a little crazy,
and she was fabulous.
You just described
Barbara.
O'Leary:
I love kumbaya,
but I want to get back
to Walkee Paws.
Yes.
$150,000 for 5%
imputes a $3 million value
for this thing.
So, we launched in 2018.
November and December,
straight out the gate,
we did $64,000.
In 2019,
we did $542,000.
O'Leary: Ooh, okay.
That's more interesting.
And how was that
broken down?
Was that primarily
direct?to?customer?
So that's all
direct?to?customer,
but about 54% on Amazon
and the rest
on my website.
And how much are you
gonna make this year?
This year, we're
looking at $1 million.
Good for you.
Good for you.
Wow!
And what are you gonna bring
to the bottom line?
$250,000.
And I haven't even expanded
into any other online venues.
Like, I haven't
expanded into Chewy,
which would be
really natural for me.
So, there's just
one product now,
but we have a whole lot
of new products
and new, exciting news
coming out.
And what kind of new products
do you have in mind?
I had consumers
emailing me and saying,
"Can we use
this product indoors
to give my dog traction ??
prevent them from slipping
and sliding?"
So I am launching a product
in about two months
called Walkee Paws
Grippy Socks,
and that is
going to be ??
Greiner: Oh.
[ Laughs ] I love it.
Actually, that's
an example of ??
That's my dog having
a really hard time getting up,
And that's the Walkee Paws
Grippy Socks.
Oh, my God.
And, essentially,
it's the same ??
Greiner: They're like the socks
that we wear
that have the little pieces
of rubber on the bottom...
Exactly,
the little sticker.
...so you don't slip.
Exactly.
Why do you value the company
at $3 million?
So, the first thing is,
I have patents.
I have a granted utility patent
on Walkee Paws.
I have three
design patents,
and I have
patents pending.
Greiner: Wow.
I've really
protected myself there,
and I own the category
of dog leggings.
All right, so,
let me just tell you
how I think about this.
You're gonna do $1 million,
gonna net $250,000.
Let's say you pay yourself
$75,000 a year.
Average out, right?
Mm?hmm.
After Year 1,
you'd probably have
around $175,000
to distribute, right?
Right.
I'd have to wait
probably about, uh...
[ Sniffs ]
...8 1/2 years
to get my money back.
Not necessarily,
because I believe
that we're right at
the tip of the iceberg.
Now, I really haven't
done that much
to grow the business.
Cuban: Yeah, but Daymond,
that doesn't assume the fact
that the company
is increasing in valuation.
It doesn't assume
that it's not
gonna be perfect tomorrow
and something's
gonna happen.
O'Leary: Okay, Lisa,
let me take a stab at it.
Yeah, but then don't invest.
If I may have the floor
for a moment.
Huh?
Don't invest then.
Wait, sorry.
What did you say?
Daymond ??
I said, "Don't invest
if you don't think" ??
Thank you for
answering my question.
I'm out.
Okay.
O'Leary: Okay...
Thanks.
I, too, have a problem
with the valuation...
Yes.
...but people are spending
a lot of time
with their pets.
I'm gonna make you
two offers
so you can choose
to solve my problem
in two different ways.
Mm?hmm.
Number one ??
I'll do the $150,000...
for 5%, but I'm putting
a royalty on it of $2.70 ??
'cause I've done
the math in my head
of how many units
you're selling ??
until I get
my $150,000 back
and it drops down to 50 cents
in perpetuity, okay?
Or I give you
the $150,000 for 20%.
You choose.
What you're doing's
incredible.
I mean, look,
valuation's hard
when you've created
a new category.
Right.
The challenge is...
I'm just not
a Walkee Paws?type guy.
You know, that's just
not my thing.
Congratulations,
but I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks, Mark.
What would you
use the money for?
I would use the money
to scale, in particular.
I think I've taken
this business
as far as I can
really take it,
'cause I've made a few
mistakes with my business,
and I just don't want to make
bigger mistakes as time goes by.
I'd rather have the advice
and the clear direction.
from a Shark.
You know what?
I don't really think
you need a partner
here today,
so I'm out.
You made a better
mouse trap, right?
That's the mother of all
invention ?? necessity.
I love the product,
but I don't think
it's the right
investment for me.
So I'm out.
Okay.
O'Leary: Well ??
I guess it's all roads
point to the badass.
They always do.
[ Laughs ]
Lisa, you just
figured that out.
But you have two offers,
not one.
You choose
between the two.
Would you consider
doing 10%
for $150,000?
I can't give up more
than 10% of my company.
Sure, you can.
You own the company.
I know I do, but I
wouldn't want to do ??
Well, that's why
I made you two offers.
Stick with your guns.
I wouldn't give up
a percentage more than 10%.
No, no, no,
but I'm ??
Look, commensurate
with the risk,
I mean, 5% ??
What risk?
Explain what the risk is.
There's no risk
in this business.
Well, then, why didn't you
make an offer?
Because it's not
my cup of tea,
but you're saying
there's a big risk.
So it's easy for you
to say that, Barbara,
when you're not putting
a dime on the table.
Look, I'm giving you
two ways to go.
Now you say ??
I'm gonna say neither
of them work for me.
I don't want to give
money up in perpetuity.
Well, then, we have
nothing to talk about.
Cuban:
Good for you, Lisa.
Then we have nothing
to talk about.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you guys.
Take care.
Congratulations on
a great company, Lisa.
Greiner: Lisa, congrats.
Well done.
Thank you so much.
Thank you guys. Appreciate it.
Daymond: Congratulations
on your business.
