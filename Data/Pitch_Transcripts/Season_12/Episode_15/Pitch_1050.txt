My name is Samantha John.
I'm here from
Brooklyn, New York,
seeking $400,000
for a 4% equity
in my company, Hopscotch.
Wow.
Back in the day
when you were little Sharks,
Your last name
is John?
My last name <i>is</i> John.
That's awesome, yeah.
Greiner: Samantha,
tell us about you.
How did you
come up with this?
You know,
when I was a kid,
I never thought
that coding was for me.
I was like, "Computers?
Those are for boys."
Um, Samantha, I'm not gonna
take a journey with you.
I've been in your sector
Mark is Samantha's
last chance for a deal
...do Johns always
figure it out?
?Good for you, Samantha.
?Oh, my gosh.
Yes!
There you go.
Congrats. I'll see you
at Thanksgiving dinner.
Thank you!
Thank you, everyone.

Samantha: When Mark Cuban said
he looked up to me,
my heart stopped.
I ?? It ?? I felt like
I wasn't even myself.
It was such
an incredible moment.
