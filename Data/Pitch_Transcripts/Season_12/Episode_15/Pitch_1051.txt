My name is Samantha John.
I'm here from
Brooklyn, New York,
seeking $400,000
for a 4% equity
in my company, Hopscotch.
Wow.
Back in the day
when you were little Sharks,
did you ever run
a lemonade stand
or mow your
neighbor's lawn?
Kids love
running businesses
because it's a way
to make their own money
and participate
in the real world.
But in today's
digital economy,
lemonade stands
are a thing of the past.
That's why
I created Hopscotch.
It's the best way
for young entrepreneurs
to build and run
their first business
on the Internet,
all from their mobile device.
They use the kid?friendly
programing language I invented
to make incredible games
that rival anything
you see in the store.
And that's not all, Sharks.
By selling those games
to the hundreds of thousands
of children in our community,
they can turn their creations
into real currency.
And the best part ??
they're learning
real coding skills
that will be valuable tools
in their future college classes
and even careers.
Through our fun educational app,
parents will be blown away
with what their kids can make.
They'll learn concepts
from game design
to graphics, animation,
and so much more.
So, Sharks,
you've all talked to kids
about how they are the
entrepreneurs of the future.
Here's your chance to put
your money where your mouth is.
Which one of you
wants to hopscotch with me
into the digital age?
Your last name
is John?
My last name <i>is</i> John.
I feel such
an affinity to you.
And you are from Brooklyn?
Yeah.
We ?? We might be family.
I might have to
call my mommy.
[ Laughter ]
So, in front of you,
you have an iPad,
and I've chosen two of my
favorite Hopscotch games
in a demo version
of Hopscotch
for you to try.
You didn't pick
the ones I did?
That I posted to Hopscotch
with my daughters?
Oh.
So, the first game
I want you to try
is called
Kaleidocosmos,
and it's a drawing game
where everything you draw
will be repeated eight times.
So you make this really cool
kaleidoscope drawing.
And this game was made
five years ago in Hopscotch.
It's since received
over 2.2 million plays.
Heck, it's a lot of fun
to do, isn't it?
Yeah.
Can I see your drawing?
Well, I'm not sure
I'm so proud of it,
but there it is.
Oh, I love it!
Oh, I like that!
It's like a logo.
Ooh, Kevin,
I like that!
Lori, that is
really pretty!
I call it
"Man's Inhumanity Against Man."
[ Laughter ]
Daymond, what you got?
That is really cool.
It kind of looks 3D.
Oh, Daymond.
Yeah.
The second game
is a platformer game,
and that was created
more recently in Hopscotch.
This game
was made by a kid
who has been on Hopscotch
for over four years.
I got up
to the first level.
Greiner:
Oh, I gotcha.
?Um...
?Oh, my God.
Well, I'm not
winning this game.
This is child's play ??
literally.
Ohh, just missed it.
I'm so ill with mine.
I actually want to
show you guys a demo
of how the coding
in Hopscotch works
so you can just
get a sense of it.
So, this is
the coding editor,
and you're coding
with these cool characters.
I'm just gonna walk you
through making this game
where the crocodile is
gonna go after the octopus,
and then
it's gonna eat it.
And then, you can do ??
With just a little bit
more code,
you can start to see
how this turns into a game.
So, now, the crocodile
has all these other people,
and it's getting bigger
as it eats more.
That's pretty cute.
Thank you.
That's awesome, yeah.
Greiner: Samantha,
tell us about you.
How did you
come up with this?
You know,
when I was a kid,
I never thought
that coding was for me.
I was like, "Computers?
Those are for boys."
And it wasn't until
my senior year of college
that I took my first
computer science class,
and it was so empowering,
and it was so creative.
And I was like,
"Why didn't I know
that programing was so fun
and creative and interesting
and I could make things that
people actually care about?"
So, Hopscotch actually
launched in 2012,
and at that time,
it was all free.
And our first week,
we got 20,000 downloads.
So we got a lot of press.
You guys were
on top of the world.
You were dominating
for kids' programing
languages at the time.
Totally.
O'Leary: And there was
no revenue at that time?
No revenue,
no revenue model.
Continued to build.
We were first?time
entrepreneurs.
We were like,
"Grow, grow, grow!"
Honestly, guys, like, when it
comes to kids and school,
there's some other
alternatives...
Yeah.
...but Hopscotch is
the go?to name.
They crush it, right?
And by the way,
when I said I used it
and posted an app,
I meant it, right?
Yeah.
I use Scratch.
And then, when my kids first
got into it at school,
we used Hopscotch
and developed games.
That's awesome.
It's intriguing.
How do I make money?
So, we have a currency
that you can buy
in Hopscotch
from the App Store.
And then, you'll be able to
use that currency
inside another kid's game.
So, that'll be
the revenue?
You'll keep the 2/3
of the revenue
from the app
you'll sell?
Yes.
And then, eventually,
we want to
let kids share
in the revenue, as well.
So we would eventually
let kids cash out
that they earn
in their game.
What the active
user base?
Our active
user base now
is about 200,000
active users a month.
What was your peak?
Our peak was in 2015,
I believe,
and we were at about
400,000.
Um, Samantha, I'm not gonna
take a journey with you.
I've been in your sector
and spent many, many years
of my career in it,
and I swore that when I left
and I exited
that that was it for me ??
that I would try
other things.
I'm out.
Mark is Samantha's
last chance for a deal
for her kids' coding app
and marketplace, Hopscotch.
So my foundation ??
the Mark Cuban Foundation ??
we do something called
the AI Boot Camp,
and we want to
introduce kids ??
to high school kids,
primarily,
in minority communities,
'cause they don't
get the chance, right?
I could work with you to do
a coding camp for kids ??
how to make money
with your phone.
Yeah.
Right?
How to create games
to make money.
Yes.
And go in even if
we have to provide them.
I'd love that.
So I'll give you
the $400,000,
but I want 16%.
16%.
Yeah, and I'll
tell you why ??
because this is
a lot of work
and I'm gonna be that person
you call or email.
Mark...
I would love to have you
be one of our investors.
Can I negotiate with you
on the price?
No.
Mark, you know, if you're
valuing this as a startup,
it's like a startup with
an experienced entrepreneur
with eight years
of experience
building programing
languages for kids,
who's proven that
she can get earned media,
who's proven that
she knows how to run
a profitable business,
has proven she knows ??
It's doing $35,000
in revenue per month
after eight years.
And I'm not trying to
take anything away
from you at all.
Obviously,
I'm incredibly impressed,
but the future
of your company
is truly in the balance
right now.
You know,
Hopscotch is my baby.
I need to value my company
for all the amazing assets
that it has.
So, fair enough.
So ?? Okay.
So, only because
I'm a softie...
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
Okay, what would you do
knowing that I don't
want to come off the 16%?
What would you do?
So, how about, uh...
$600,000 for 5%?
I'm out.
O'Leary: Ooh.
Ouch.
I'll give you
one more chance.
Um...
We're not close.
You've got to
at least be close.
Yeah, we're not close.
I think that maybe
it might just be
that the way
I value Hopscotch
just isn't quite ??
There's no way
in the world
you thought you were coming
in here and getting 4%.
And if 5% is your end,
then you really
did not want to do it.
Uh, yeah.
Okay, wait ??
You don't need to
talk to me about it,
but, come on,
let's be realistic.
Actually, I think
I did the math wrong.
I'm sorry, I was gonna say
$600,000 for 10%.
...do Johns always
figure it out?
?Good for you, Samantha.
?Oh, my gosh.
Yes!
There you go.
Congrats. I'll see you
at Thanksgiving dinner.
Thank you!
Thank you, everyone.
[ Laughter ]
Samantha: When Mark Cuban said
he looked up to me,
my heart stopped.
I ?? It ?? I felt like
I wasn't even myself.
It was such
an incredible moment.
And then, the fact that
we got a deal with him,
I just ?? I ??
I've lost all my words.
