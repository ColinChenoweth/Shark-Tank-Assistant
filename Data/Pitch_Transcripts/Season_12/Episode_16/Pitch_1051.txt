Hi, there.
My name is Jared Cannon
from the great city of Philly,
Jared, I think ??
I think
you're in trouble.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
but Daymond is concerned about
the large amount of money
that Jared has raised
for his salad?in?a?jar company,
Simply Good Jars.
Jared, I think ?? I think
you're in trouble.
I hope not.
I don't believe
I'm in trouble at all.
Herjavec: I hope not.
You know, you're gonna need
several more raises.
You're not gonna be in control
of the company anymore
'cause you're at 51%.
You lose control
right here today.
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried for you, man.
Why?
Look, if I'm gonna
raise a series A,
I'm gonna lose control.
No entrepreneur
that's gonna take something
to the level
that we are shooting for
is gonna have 80%
of the company in his pocket.
Do you remember Plated?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Know them well.
Okay, that was my deal.
Yep.
Your numbers are identical
in the second year.
Sure.
Jared, I love it, except
I just realized something.
I don't think
it's gonna work.
I actually think you're gonna
start losing far more money
as you get bigger.
Yeah.
"Here you go, homey."
Jared, here's how I look at it.
You know, you have three very
different people sitting here.
I do.
I don't think
we're going to have to worry.
Kevin wants to, like,
raise more money.
But what I like to do
Yeah. You know what, Jared?
I'll change my offer.
I'm not gonna do it
as a loan.
I'm gonna do it as equity.
I'll offer you $500,000
for 7%.
Did you want me in on it?
Did you make an offer to me
earlier?
I'll do that deal as equity
right now.
Done.
Both of you?
Us?
Oh, the two of us,
you mean?
Would you be willing to go in
with Mark as an equity deal,
Thank you very much.
Good job, Jared, man.
Thanks, guys.
Great job.
Herjavec: Good job.
Congrats.
Yeah, having two Sharks
on board,
we're ready
to shake this thing up,
get out there, sell some jars,
change the world
one jar at a time.
I want to say, "I wouldn't
be a billionaire..."
[ Laughs ]
I mean, that's just,
like, there.
