Hi, there.
My name is Jared Cannon
from the great city of Philly,
and I'm seeking $500,000
for 7% equity in my company.
Sharks, if you couldn't tell,
I'm a chef.
I've prepared some
of the most exquisite meals
you can even imagine,
but my favorite to prepare is ??
you're never gonna guess ??
a salad.
[ Chuckles ]
But not just any salad, Sharks.
I make a mean smoked salmon
salad with pearled couscous,
fennel, radish, feta,
and aji amarillo vinaigrette
that will knock your socks off.
What if I told you
you could have a five?star meal
served to you right in a jar?
Well, that's where we come in.
At Simply Good Jars,
we are revolutionizing
the packaged salad
to create simply delicious,
simply beautiful meals
bursting with every bite.
So say goodbye to messy,
flavorless, and boring greens
and hello to fresh,
vibrant, nutritious salads
packed into our easy
grab?and?go jars.
So just shake it up,
and the salad will mix itself.
You can eat
directly out of the jar.
Herjavec: Wow.
And if you need to take a break
or make a move,
simply cap it,
and you're good to go.
And the best part ??
all our jars are returnable.
So for every jar
that we get back,
we not only reuse it
to help Mother Earth,
but we also donate one meal
to feed someone in need.
Good for you.
Sharks, at Simply Good Jars...
Nice.
...we believe fresh,
healthy food
should be easy to grab
as a bag of chips.
So tell me,
who wants to shake things up
and help us create the new
standard for eating on the go?
Can we try it?
Of course!
It really shakes.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
You know, I really thought,
seeing it all layered there,
that it wouldn't, but it does.
?Yeah.
?Yeah, it's very deceiving.
That's wild.
Wow, yeah.
I just want to shake
the other one now. Oh!
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
Smoked salmon.
This is very,
very good.
Thank you. Thank you.
It's really good,
really good.
Thank you.
?Yeah, it's fresh.
?Good.
?Wow.
?It is fresh.
What's the shelf life
of it?
So, it's a nine?day
shelf life.
Why can't anybody
just put together a jar
that's shake and bake
and I made it at home, right?
So, the whole jarred?salad
thing is like a Pinterest fad.
It's been around forever, but
nobody's ever commercialized it.
I see a cooler here.
Are you selling this
where people are putting it
into their own coolers?
And, Jared, how did you
get into retail?
How did you
make that transition?
So, between Easter
and Memorial Day,
we went from four locations
to 230 doors.
Wow.
Greiner: Wow.
We launched Walgreens
in Chicago,
and then we launched
175 C stores,
and we partner
with CloudKitchens.
And we're able to list
our products
on these meal?delivery
platforms,
where now we get low?friction
trial, because for us ??
And that's where you
maximize your margin,
and that's where you make
the most money, right?
Can you afford the 30%
that they take?
Oh, yeah.
It's only 10%.
Okay, but are you going to
actually, as a company,
set up a CloudKitchen
for each major demographic?
Yeah, so our contract
with CloudKitchens is national.
And what do you
sell one for?
So, jars sell from $8.99
to $10.99 today.
And what do you sell it
to the retailer for?
So, on the wholesale model,
we're selling it $5 to $6.
It costs us
about $2.50 to $3.60.
So you're making
about $3.50 each.
Alright, why don't we
talk about your numbers?
So, first of all, excellent,
excellent, excellent salad.
Oh, thank you.
So what did you do
last year?
Sure.
And then what are you on track
to do this year?
So last year, we did
just shy of about $300,000.
$300,000?
$300,000 last year.
Wait a minute.
Hold on. Wait.
I want to make sure that I heard
the valuation correctly.
You want $500,000 for 7%?
That's it?
Oh, yeah.
Alright, talk to me, baby.
What are you on track
to do this year?
So, we're $475,000
year to date.
Ooh.
We're on track to do about
$700,000, $750,000 this year.
$750,000, and how much
will you make on that?
We're not profitable.
We won't be for about a year.
Oh!
And how much
have you raised?
We raised $2.5 million
to date.
?Whoa!
?Wow.
?I know.
?Wow.
A lot of that was predicated
on buying 60 of these things
and really funding
that model.
You did say that you're not
gonna make any money this year.
Correct.
What did you lose last year?
Probably not next year, either.
What did you lose?
$900,000.
Last year,
you lost $900,000?
?Yep.
?Wow.
We're gonna probably
lose that this year again.
?Ouch! Ouch!
?Oh!
But we more than doubled
our revenue.
But hear me out.
So this is a food company
that we're looking to take
to a national distribution
in 18 months.
We have the relationships,
the production,
and the distribution.
We're building this
to $50 million
to $100 million company
in the next two years.
How much of your own money
did you invest in this?
So I started this entire company
on a $1,000 loan.
?Okay.
?Really?
?Cool.
?Oh, yeah.
I had been working on this
for probably five years.
And how much of the company
do you own?
51%.
?Ooh. Okay.
?Ooh!
Who owns the other 49%?
We have probably about
a cap table
of maybe 12 other individuals
and groups.
But I've assembled a team to
take this to scale in a big way
and do it smartly.
So we're paying for that.
Jared, I think ??
I think
you're in trouble.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
but Daymond is concerned about
the large amount of money
that Jared has raised
for his salad?in?a?jar company,
Simply Good Jars.
Jared, I think ?? I think
you're in trouble.
I hope not.
I don't believe
I'm in trouble at all.
Herjavec: I hope not.
You know, you're gonna need
several more raises.
You're not gonna be in control
of the company anymore
'cause you're at 51%.
You lose control
right here today.
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried for you, man.
Why?
Look, if I'm gonna
raise a series A,
I'm gonna lose control.
No entrepreneur
that's gonna take something
to the level
that we are shooting for
is gonna have 80%
of the company in his pocket.
Do you remember Plated?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Know them well.
Okay, that was my deal.
Yep.
Your numbers are identical
in the second year.
Sure.
We were losing between $900,000
and $1.5 million
for three years in a row.
Right.
It is expensive, baby.
Sure.
So that was
a big, big, big burn,
and it was scaring the living
you know what out of me...
Yep.
...until we sold it
to Albertsons for $340 million.
Sure.
So I'm a believer
in this space.
And I like the product.
So I'm thinking
you're gonna need to raise
somewhere between another
5 and 10 million bucks.
That's exactly what
we're doing right now, yep.
Okay, and so that's
extremely dilutive.
I'm gonna make you the same
offer I made the Plated guys.
They choked on it, but we all
made a lot of money later.
I will do the $500,000 as debt
at 9.5%,
and I'll take the 7%
as equity...
It's the same.
...so that you're not going to
dilute yourself any more,
and that 7%'s
gonna get diluted down
to about 4%
by the time you finish.
Yep.
And I'll help you
with the A round.
A lot more than that.
I know how to do
that syndication.
I love the deal, so I'm
definitely considering it.
It's not off the table.
Jared, I love it, except
I just realized something.
I don't think
it's gonna work.
I actually think you're gonna
start losing far more money
as you get bigger.
Yeah.
And the only light
at the end of that tunnel
is somebody
buying you out.
You've got to be
everywhere tomorrow.
I see too much risk
for me in this.
I hear you.
I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Yeah. Yeah. So...
[ Inhales sharply ]
I think you're in trouble,
but I actually like you so much,
maybe 'cause of the salad,
that I ??
You started with $1,000.
That's as underdog
as you can get.
Yeah, I'm not mad at it, right?
I think you're gonna have to
raise a lot of money
or you're gonna die,
and I see a lot of these deals,
but I just don't know
if you're gonna be able
to make it through
that critical time.
Sure. Well, this is
the critical time, right?
And for us, 500 doors
represents $5 million.
I know it is, but I don't want
it to be a critical time
for my money,
so I'm out.
Listen, you were in a situation
in COVID.
It wasn't working.
Everything closed down.
You created something new.
I would actually consider going
in on this deal with Kevin.
Kevin?
I would consider that.
'Cause I don't normally ??
I'm a lone shark.
I like
to do things myself.
But the reason
why I would consider
is because I think with my sales
and marketing skills,
packaging skills,
and I like Kevin,
and his experience with Plated,
I find very appealing.
I think it's a good combo
because we get
the marketing from Lori.
But I want to work with you
on the A round.
Yeah.
Look, I'll make it official.
I'll go in with her,
same deal.
We'll go 50/50,
exactly the terms detailed.
I want to work on funding
the next round.
Or do you want to hear
what Mark has to say?
Mark's quiet over there.
Yeah, Mark's always quiet.
I always want to entertain
what's in front of me,
too, so...
Yeah.
Want to throw your foot in,
please do.
So, I'll match their offer,
but at 3% interest.
But I'm gonna suggest that
we don't push for the series A.
That's a mistake.
You will never be a Plated
if you stay small.
[ Sighs ]
Look, you're already positioned
to scale, right?
Yes.
This is tough.
You know what?
I would not be
a billionaire
if I had just kept on
raising money
over and over
and over again.
I'm with it.
Right?
Yeah.
Damn, that's nice to say.
Greiner: We're not gonna
have to keep raising.
Herjavec: God.
We're gonna be doing
so well...
It's true.
That's just putting it
on the table right there.
...we won't have to
keep raising.
"Here you go, homey."
Jared, here's how I look at it.
You know, you have three very
different people sitting here.
I do.
I don't think
we're going to have to worry.
Kevin wants to, like,
raise more money.
But what I like to do
is I like to get so many sales
and do it so fast
and blitz out so fast...
Exactly.
So, Lori, you and I
should be working together.
...that you're not going to have
to do a whole bunch of raising.
She's right.
She's actually right on that.
Right?
Yeah. You know what, Jared?
I'll change my offer.
I'm not gonna do it
as a loan.
I'm gonna do it as equity.
I'll offer you $500,000
for 7%.
Did you want me in on it?
Did you make an offer to me
earlier?
I'll do that deal as equity
right now.
Done.
Both of you?
Us?
Oh, the two of us,
you mean?
Would you be willing to go in
with Mark as an equity deal,
$500,000, 8%, 4% and 4%,
call it a deal?
You make it 10%,
I'll split it with her.
If you make it 10%,
I'll do that deal.
As equity.
Can we go up a little bit
in dollars?
You're getting two Sharks.
Come on.
Greiner and Cuban:
You're getting two Sharks.
I know.
And we're gonna
increase your sales.
Greiner: Come on, baby.
And think about it ??
Okay, 10%, deal.
Done.
Done.
Done.
Boom!
Let's shake that salad.
?Let's shake the salad.
?Congratulations.
Thanks, guys.
I appreciate everyone's time.
Thank you very much.
Good job, Jared, man.
Thanks, guys.
Great job.
Herjavec: Good job.
Congrats.
Yeah, having two Sharks
on board,
we're ready
to shake this thing up,
get out there, sell some jars,
change the world
one jar at a time.
I want to say, "I wouldn't
be a billionaire..."
[ Laughs ]
I mean, that's just,
like, there.
You know what?
And I like saying it.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator: In Season 10,
Noel Durity made a deal
with Mark Cuban
for his patented hairstyling
tool, the Twist It Up Comb.
Is that a yes?
It's a yes.
Narrator: Let's see
what he's up to now.
I invented the Twist It Up Comb
because I wanted to provide
a styling comb
for the Black community
that allowed us
to embrace our natural twists.
Twist It Up Comb is now sold
on my website, on Amazon,
and now over 250
beauty?supply stores nationwide.
Less than two years
after "Shark Tank,"
we have done over $2 million
in sales.
But just three months
after airing,
I saw that my comb
was being knocked off
and being sold to beauty?supply
stores around the country.
Calm before the storm.
To see all my hard work
be copycatted broke my heart.
I consulted a lawyer
and took off on a road trip
to over 100 stores,
over 24 cities
from New York to California.
We ended up confiscating
over 1,000 combs,
over 40 invoices
I used as evidence
to win a six?figure settlement
against these copycats.
You just got in the car
and got it done,
but that's what you do,
my guy.
Knock?offs are a pestilence
on every successful product,
and Noel did not back down.
We took every measure possible
to deal with them,
and there are gonna be more,
and we'll keep on fighting.
How big are we gonna
get this thing, Noel?
Big as God wants me to make it,
as big as I can grind.
Noel's future with
Twist It Up is incredible.
He is the dominant product
in this space.
