I'm Nancy Rothner
from Lewes, Delaware,
You know what, Nancy?
Congratulations
on what you've done.
It's just not a space
that I really want to be in.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
I'm thinking about it.
I like it as a customer.
But just not for me.
I wouldn't see any passion
in trying to get it out there
or helping,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
The problem is, you never built
your digital direct to customer
while you were experiencing
this growth in retail.
Exactly.
I'm interested,
but my offer's gonna be sharky
in the sense that I don't know
what I don't know
about the digital pivot, okay?
Okay, alright.
You can counter, Nancy.
I'd like to counter.
Go ahead.
I'd like to counter.
Well, Nancy,
before you counter,
the dough,
it's speaking to me.
Yay.
The longer I play with it,
it's like,
"Make an offer."
I love the mission.
Thank you.
I can relate to it.
I'll make you
the same offer.
I'll give you the $300,000...
Okay, thank you.
...for 25%.
I would love to work
with either one of you,
but 25% is just more
than I can do.
I would like to counter
to each of you at 10%.
Good for you.
Don't give up your company.
Ohh!
No, I don't want
to give up.
Says the woman
who will give you nothing.
I gave her good advice.
You sure did.
That's wonderful.
It's worth exactly that.
I'm gonna stick
at the 25%.
I just think it's such
a great opportunity.
You got to make a decision,
Nancy.
Okay.
One of those moments.
Okay.
Alright,
you're all amazing.
I want this more than anything.
I really do. So...
Robert, I will gladly
accept your deal.
