So, before COVID, the primary
revenue driver for our business
was, you know, really supported
by this fleet
of these smart coolers
that we would put into places
where there was kind of
a captive audience,
not a lot of access to food,
let alone fresh food.
Like what kind
of places?
Hotels, airports...
Office buildings?
...convention centers,
office buildings, universities.
So, after COVID?
So, as you would imagine,
all the places that we had
distribution ?? 98% gone.
Yeah, your traffic ?? gone.
Yeah.
?Right?
?Yeah.
So, literally
almost overnight.
So we had to figure out,
how were we going to follow that
customer to where they were now,
right, which was
at home working,
shopping at their local store.
And we were able to very quickly
make the pivot to retail.
And the reality was,
salad bars went bye?bye, right?
At grocery stores.
And will stay bye?bye, yeah.
Oh, yeah,
and they might not come back.
The industry thinks
if they do come back,
it's still gonna be
about two years.
Great point.
Yeah.
So as we build visibility
and awareness,
this product
is just gonna skyrocket.
Durity:
As a Black?owned business,
it's very important
for me to succeed
because I represent the idea
that it is possible
someone that looks like me
can succeed in America.
It gives the culture hope.
When you look at me,
I want it to inspire you.
And I think going through
this entire process
with "Shark Tank," reaching
the success that I have reached,
I honestly think that is exactly
what is happening.
It is allowing me
to fulfill my purpose
and share this idea
with the world
and that they can find
the courage
to go after their dream
looking at my life.
And I want to thank "Shark Tank"
and I want to thank Mark Cuban
for all of that.
What would the business
make all?in?
This year,
it's not our best year.
We'll probably make $220,000.
Last year, though ??
After you pay yourself.
Yes, after I pay myself.
That's fantastic.
Thank you.
Last year, after I paid myself,
we profited $584,000.
?Yeah!
?Wow!
?Wow!
Thank you.
That'll reduce your stress
right there.
For me, I feel like this product
is a great business for you,
and I think getting
an online presence,
just hire
some really smart people
that can help you
to do a website
and can help you
with digital advertising.
But you're doing so well.
Yeah.
I don't think
that you need a partner
to help you to do
that one thing, so I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
You have one offer from me.
Yes.
I'm asking you for 25%
for $300,000.
Right.
What do you want to do?
My name is Taylor.
People know me as Earl.
My name is Garret.
People like to call me Buddy.
And we are from the amazing
small town of Holstein, Iowa.
We're here seeking $25,000
for a 25% stake in our company.
Sharks, we're just
some small?town boys
that know how to
work hard...
Dang.
...but, most importantly,
have a good time.
Everybody knows when you're
working out in the cold,
you use earmuffs
to keep your ears warm.
But what if I want
to keep my drinks cold?
That's why we created
Muff Waders!
Muff Waders!
The first?ever bibs made
to keep your drinks close
while working outdoors
or being the life of the party.
The main feature is
the insulated six?pack cooler
located right here
on the chest.
Yeah! That's the way
to have a six?pack.
What?!
This cooler
has six pockets
that hold 12?ounce cans
and bottles perfectly.
On the side of each leg,
we have a deep side pocket
that holds your favorite
beverage nice and snug.
Bingo!
Up top, we have
a hidden concealed pocket
that allows you
to store valuable items
some people might
judge you for having.
Kind of like Earl's little
childhood stuffed animal
he brings around.
Oh, little Leroy.
But wait, Sharks.
That's not all.
Muff Waders comes complete
with a bottle opener
and a Muff Mug.
This allows you
to go hands?free
for if you're out at the
tailgate tossing the pigskin,
or maybe you're out in the
timber wrassling a 'Squatch.
I don't know, Sharks.
Sometimes you got to
be hands?free.
Look, Sharks,
we're just regular guys
who like to work hard
but have a little fun.
We're chasing
the American dream.
We came up with this idea to
bring jobs back to our hometown.
And with your help,
we believe we can get
every blue?collar man
into a pair
of Muff Waders.
Alright, Sharks, there's
a couple sets of Muff Waders
in front of you, if you want
to take a look at them.
I think there's a beer inside,
and we'll talk some turkey.
?Oh! [ Laughs ]
?Yes, sir.
Oh, there is, too.
So who came up with this?
Earl.
So I came up with it
a couple years back.
We were at a football game.
I went to the bar.
And I just kept thinking
after I got off work,
"I wish I would have
just had my overalls on still
and brought a couple
beers with me."
And then I woke up
the next morning, had a drawing,
and just started
making them, basically.
Guys,
I got to say thank you.
Thank you for not inventing this
while I was in college.
I'd be dead.
Yes, yes.
It's perfect
for tailgates.
Taylor, how did you meet Garret,
and what does Garret do?
We know you invented it.
You're the brains.
What's Garret?
What I do right now ?? I just
graduated Iowa State University.
My plan was to go full time
with Muff Waders,
but I had a beautiful boy
in September.
?Congrats.
?Congrats.
?Congrats.
Little Teddy.
I could not take this on
full time.
So I work.
And then I come home, spend time
with my beautiful son,
my girlfriend,
and then once they're asleep,
I work on Muff Waders
from 11:00 to 2:00.
So you guys are buddies?
Yeah.
Yeah, we grew up together.
Yes, we're good friends.
Do you have any sales?
So, we have $54,000 worth
of sales since last September,
was when we first
started selling.
Good for you.
Oh, you do?
How did you sell them?
Online.
We have our own website.
We're through Amazon.
Taylor,
what does it sell for?
$85.
What does it cost you
to manufacture?
Costs $39.50.
That's including the bottle
opener and the Muff Mug.
John: Where are you
manufacturing out of?
Right now
we are switching manufacturers
'cause our manufacturer
in China shut down.
Let me just take
a wild guess.
I would assume you're probably
about $75,000 invested into it.
Invested into it.
Yeah.
Actually right on the dot.
That's right on the dot.
$70,000, $5,000.
There you go, DJ.
How'd you know that?
Wow, good one.
But that's what we've invested.
We're not in debt that.
It's not bad.
How many units?
To get your own
product...
And make it to "Shark Tank."
...and learn ??
and learn on the fly?
And you're drinking beer
on "Shark Tank."
Cheers. Cheers.
Let's drink to that, guys.
That's also not
our only product.
Cheers.
Yeah. One second.
Will you hold that?
Yeah. Here, hold on, guys.
We got another product that's
gonna help us get going here.
Oh, no.
?But yet there's more.
?But wait, there's more?
There's more.
Got some suspenders for you.
I love that.
That is the winner
right there.
So we thought,
you know, $85 ??
People are saying,
"We love you guys.
We love your brand, but we don't
want to spend $85."
So Earl said, "Hey,
let's put these same pockets,
let's put two of them
on the suspenders,"
and then keep the branding
with the bottle opener
and the koozie
right there.
How much
are the suspenders?
So you guys are looking
at the first prototype.
Only pair in the U. S.
right there.
There you go.
Collector's item.
Do you have a patent on it?
Glad you brought that up.
So right now we have two patents
on the Muff Waders themselves.
One is issued,
one is notice of allowance,
which I believe means we just
pay for it, comes to us.
Yeah, it means
you're getting one.
Yeah, and then we have two more
coming on the suspenders.
We just started
on these.
So, guys, how much do you have
in inventory?
Inventory.
We have about 400 left.
Yeah, about 400 left.
And we're actually sold out
of this extra?large brown,
and we're running low
on our large black.
So if you're changing
manufacturers,
what are you gonna do?
So, that's
a good question.
I know it is.
We've called them.
And we have a couple people
lined up for a bigger order,
and we have some lined up
to use.
Sorry, Taylor, why did
the factory close?
Coronavirus.
I have no ??
Yeah, I think it was the virus.
'Cause they didn't have
anything to make.
I called the guy back,
and basically I don't know
what happened to the ??
What was
that question again?
[ Laughter ]
To Earl!
Let's drink to Earl!
?That's Earl for ya!
?Earl!
Guys, I love the story.
I love you guys.
Like, I'm amazed.
Here you are on "Shark Tank"
drinking beer.
It can't get any better.
But, guys, it's just not for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
Hey, guys, what you're doing
is incredible.
I mean, I will wear this,
but it's just clothing business,
I'm just not that guy
to go out there.
Drinking,
I'm all in, right?
But the clothing side of it, I'm
just not the guy to help you.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Herjavec: Hey, Earl, I think
you guys done a great job.
I will not be wearing it,
but I wish you all the best.
I'm out.
We are gonna keep going
regardless,
but I think we'd make it there
a lot faster
if we had somebody
just a phone call away.
Well, you still got
Daymond and Lori.
Greiner:
I will tell you something.
My suggestion ??
do some Instagram ads.
Do some, like, 30?second,
60?second videos.
Use you two.
We are doing that.
But right now
we're trying to cut back.
We only did about $200
of Facebook ads on the holidays.
Actually did it
for one day,
and we sold over $2,000
in one day.
?Yeah, absolutely.
?That's a good return.
People love these ads.
Like you said, it goes viral.
I'm telling you,
that is all you need to do.
They organically grow.
But this is not
the right deal for me.
Love you guys,
love the product.
And I know you're gonna make it,
but I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you, Lori.
Okay, Muff brothers,
all is not lost.
Four Sharks are out,
but we have one Shark left
who happens to be
the fashion guru.
Daymond.
And you're the fisherman.
And the fisherman.
Oh, it couldn't
be more perfect, guys.
I feel the stars are aligning.
I feel good things, Daymond.
Yeah. You know, listen,
I was in this space.
I started off in that space.
And like you say, you need
somebody to give you direction.
I probably, if I was a partner,
I would have probably given you
the wrong advice,
to be very honest, because
even though there's that space,
there's so many different
segments of that space.
I don't think
I can help you much.
And you guys have a good,
slow, steady run.
You've learned a lot.
I think you'll be okay.
So I'm out.
?Congratulations, man.
?Keep killing it.
?You guys are great.
?Thanks, guys.
Cuban: Keep on doing
what you're doing.
Congrats.
Nees: Thank you.
Oh, my God.
I love these guys.
I love that.
That was hilarious.
It's tough.
Thought we had them.
Nees:
I'm pretty pissed off.
I think America's
gonna love the product.
I think they missed on
two great guys who work hard,
and we've gotten here
by ourselves from the start.
And, quite frankly,
we'll just keep going.
We'll just keep pushing,
and we're gonna make it
to the next level without them.
Narrator: Next up is a solution
to a common problem for babies.
for 5% of my business,
Busy Baby.
Wow.
If you've ever gone out to eat
with an infant or a toddler,
you know how stressful
it can be.
You struggle to keep things
out of baby's reach,
give them something acceptable
to play with,
only to have that item
immediately thrown
onto the floor.
You pick it up,
wipe off the gross germs,
which are of concern
now more than ever,
return it to the child.
And inevitably, the cycle
continues the entire meal.
A problem solver by nature,
I decided to create something
to keep our kids entertained
and to save our backs
and sanity.
Parents, keeping your babies
busy just got a whole lot easier
because of the Busy Baby Mat.
The Busy Baby Mat is a 100%
food?grade silicone place mat
that suctions
to any smooth surface.
And it has a tether system
that allows you to attach
any of baby's favorite toys
to the mat
so that they always stay
within arm's reach.
It's a clean place
for baby's food,
dishwasher?safe, rolls up
into a convenient sleeve
that fits easily in your purse
or diaper bag.
And best of all...
no more toys on the floor.
And the Busy Baby Mat
has endless uses.
Wrap it around
a shopping cart handle
to stop baby from teething
on those nasty handles.
Stick it to a window, motivate
baby to stand up and play.
Big kids can even color on it
with washable markers
that easily wipe clean.
Now, who wants to get busy?
Ooh, that sticks
really good.
It works.
That's secure.
It works.
Tell us about you
and how you
came up with this.
Okay, well,
I was born and raised
the daughter
of an entrepreneur.
My dad has always had
his own business,
and so I learned from him
that I absolutely want
to have my own business.
So after I graduated
high school,
I actually joined the Army.
I spent 10 years in the Army
traveling the world.
Wow.
?Thank you for your service.
?Thank you for your service.
You're welcome.
After 10 years of the Army,
10 years of now civilian life,
I finally meet my perfect match
and we start a family.
So some girlfriends
took me out to lunch,
and the moms brought their
two little 1?year?old daughters,
and they were
the sweetest girls, so cute.
But they were a constant
distraction the entire meal.
So I sat there at lunch,
and I got on Amazon.
And I was like, "I need to
find something for my kids
so that when we go out
and he's big enough to sit up,
he's not gonna be
that distraction."
And there really
wasn't anything.
And then I thought, "This is it.
This is my thing.
This is what I'm gonna do
that's gonna get me
out of this corporate rat race."
I started that night cutting
and gluing things together.
So I have a video to show
you guys of me as a new mom
three years and two days ago,
sitting at my dining room table
making prototypes.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Love that.
[ Chuckles ]
?Awesome! Awesome!
?That's great.
?That's great.
?Make it happen.
I really believe that
if you believe in yourself
and your goals, then you will
literally make it happen.
I believe that 100%.
And here it is.
Is there anybody else out there
doing something like this?
So there are lots
of place mats.
Yeah.
There are a lot of place mats
with built?in bowls.
Yes.
There's been one here.
And that's a great product for
kids that are starting to eat.
There's also a product
that has tethers,
but it doesn't have
the surface for the food.
I've not seen any others
that have toys attached.
And what does it cost?
This is $24.99.
And what does it
cost you to make?
$6.
Did you try
and patent this?
Greiner:
So what's your patent?
It is patented.
It is?
I have two patents.
Are they utility patents
or design?
I have two utility patents
in the U. S.,
and I have a utility model
that's written in China as well.
Wow. Really good.
Wow. I never would have thought
you'd get a patent for that.
Love the story.
Love the video.
Now you're in the Tank.
Let's talk money.
Okay, what are your sales?
Well, I started
selling last year.
2019, I ended the year
at $97,000.
Okay.
I know that's not a ton.
I know that.
Proof of concept, though.
People are buying it.
?So 2020, right?
?Mm?hmm.
Tell us about
what happened.
So in 2019, I traveled
around the country
from expo to expo to expo
to expo on the weekends
to get in front of people
and do the demos.
And so for 2020,
that was my plan.
And then a pandemic happened.
Yeah.
And so January and February
was maybe $20,000 in sales.
Since then, I have now
had $323,000 in sales.
?Whoa.
?Wow! How did that happen?
?How did that happen?
?That's fast.
Well, in March,
when all my sales dropped
and I had no expos
to go to anymore,
which was my big plan,
I said, "You know what?
I'm gonna divert
all of my travel budget
for my expos
to social?media ads."
And I went from zero orders
to 20 orders a day...
Greiner: Wow.
...within two days.
O'Leary: You've done
the great digital pivot,
which so many entrepreneurs
haven't been able to figure out.
But the ones that have
end up like you.
What do you think you'll get
by year end,
given you're past $300,000
already?
I'm looking at
just under $900,000.
?Whoo! Wow.
?How much?
Just under $900,000.
Cuban: On that same topic,
how much will you make
from your $900,000
in sales?
The net profit is 20%.
Okay, so about $180,000.
Mm?hmm.
Normally at this point,
with about $400,000 in sales
and projected $900,000,
we would be ripping you apart
for a $5 million
valuation.
Why do you think the company
is worth $5 million?
Okay, so if I keep doing exactly
what I'm doing right now,
I'm also adding toys to my
website so that it's an add?on.
What kind of toys?
Teething toys.
I have two, so all the toys
you see, basically,
in front of you,
they all are ??
Okay, so they're
upsell accessories.
They're upsells.
Okay.
I have a lot of people
coming back to buy these now
as baby shower gifts,
so next year, I can easily do
$5 million just with that
without changing anything else.
O'Leary: Very aggressive.
Mark and I invested
in a product called Lollacup
years ago,
I think Season ??
Works great with the mat.
Cuban: Yeah, which we just sold.
Which we just sold.
Yeah, we just sold it.
Works great with the mat.
Yeah, and it worked out great.
Go right around the handle.
The problem with a lot
of these baby products
is it's a relatively
limited market.
You've got
this limited window.
It's a single product.
It's a great product.
But you know what?
Babies are born every year.
Millions of them every year
all over the world.
Cuban: Yeah, they are.
Yeah, they are.
So the market regenerates itself
every single year.
What you're doing
is incredible, right?
And I love the idea that
you've created a platform.
The upsells
are brilliant.
But the reality is,
the baby market
is a very unique
and specific market
that requires
a certain skill set.
And since
we sold Lollacup,
that was my last foray
into the baby market.
So while what you've
accomplished is amazing,
it's not really a fit for me,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
I totally understand.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
You know,
I'm always in awe of women
that serve
in the military.
You know, I look at you
and I'm already impressed by you
because you did that
and you did it for 10 years.
I'm gonna give you
an offer.
It'll be
a little aggressive.
Narrator: One Shark is out.
in the baby business,
how hard it is.
I'm out.
John: Yeah,
let me help you, as well.
I don't think I want to be
in the baby?product space
at this time.
I'm out.
How much of the company
do you own?
I own 100% of my company.
?Oh, my goodness.
?What a great response.
?You have 100%.
?Please.
Greiner: You have 100%
of your company.
I do.
If you feel the 3%
isn't worth it...
It has to be
worth my time.
I don't know that I would do
as well without you,
but I didn't want
to go past 15%,
and I had to stick to that.
I respect that.
I got to stick to it
'cause I know what I've done...
I respect that.
...and I know what's coming up
and I know what I can do.
So are you out, Lori?
Greiner: Well, listen.
15%?
No, I'm sorry.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you, guys.
Good luck.
