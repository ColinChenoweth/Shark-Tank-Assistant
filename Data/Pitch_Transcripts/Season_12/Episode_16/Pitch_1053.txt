I'm Nancy Rothner
from Lewes, Delaware,
and I'm here
to talk about something
we have all experienced ??
stress.
And as a matter of fact,
I'm feeling some of it now
standing in front of all of you.
Now, I think you'll all agree,
with the current
pandemic situation,
stress has reached
an all?time high,
and this may seem unbelievable,
but I believe I've come up
with a solution to stress.
And it's so simple,
you'll be saying, "Pinch me."
And that's what it's called ??
Pinch Me Therapy Dough.
It's an innovative,
aromatherapy?infused,
moldable, multisensory
stress reliever.
At the first hint of stress,
simply take some out, knead it,
and allow the calming to begin.
Now, for the last 20 years,
I've worked as a therapist
in the field
of stress reduction.
I've seen time and time again
what's most effective
to quickly de?stress.
And I wanted to find a way
to reach more people.
I'm confident with your help
and expertise,
we can reduce stress
around the world.
I'm seeking $300,000 in exchange
for 7% of my company.
?Oh!
?Wow.
I just got stressed.
Yeah. Now we're stressed.
There are some samples in front
of you that should help.
So, Sharks, who wants to
pinch me and make some dough?
So we just scoop it out?
Scoop it out, yeah.
And there's no wrong way
to use it.
You can knead it, massage it,
take as little or as much
as you like out,
and you can use it
over and over again.
Oh, it feels great.
This one smells fantastic.
Thank you.
I love the yellow.
Yeah.
The scent component's there
because when we're stressed,
what happens is everything
in our system runs tight,
including our breath.
Grr!
Since our brain is so heavily
hardwired to our fingers,
this helps us to become
a little bit more centered.
Then the tension that we have
in our body
has a way to release out
through the fingers.
So if my child gets ahold
of this, no problem?
Yes. Lab?tested safe
and nontoxic.
It tastes hideous.
So I don't think anybody
would even consider it, yeah.
Right, okay.
Greiner: Is this lavender,
the purple?
Yes.
That's lavender?
John:
Oh, it tastes like soap.
Oh, it's terrible.
Cuban: Tried it, yeah.
Give it to Daymond.
He'll eat anything.
She says to you,
"It tastes terrible."
Yeah, I told you
it tastes terrible.
John: Oh, my God.
[ Laughs ]
Tell us about you,
about your background.
What's your story?
I worked as a stockbroker,
did that for five years.
You were a stockbroker?
I was, yeah.
But then I volunteered at
a shelter for domestic violence,
and that just inspired me.
I knew that's what
I wanted to do.
So I studied, trained.
I worked so hard.
And I became certified
in therapeutic services
so I would be able to help
people overcome addictions,
phobia, stress ?? you name it.
So one night, I thought,
"How can I help more people?"
And then [Snaps fingers] boom,
I had that light?bulb moment.
I knew exactly what to do.
I got to work, never stopped.
And the result is Pinch Me.
So what does it cost for you
to make, and what is the retail?
Sure. All?in cost
for the smallest, $4.50,
with retail $14.99.
For the large, $7.50,
retail $24.99.
What are your sales?
Lifetime sales are $5.3 million.
?What?
?Wow.
?What?
?Yes. Yes.
?Really?
Yeah, how long
is that lifetime?
Well, actually, 2015,
I walked into a few stores
to introduce myself.
They immediately said yes,
sold out, were placing orders.
And then the summer of 2015, my
husband and I were blindsided.
He was diagnosed with leukemia.
Oh, no.
And so suddenly our life
was all about
just getting through the day.
So I really had to
put sales on hold.
He came through it great.
He's doing wonderfully.
Great.
Great to hear.
And now 2016,
I had sales of $200,000.
Then the next year, 2017,
I did $800,000.
Wow.
Then the next year, in 2018,
we did $1.6 million.
Then last year, $1.95 million.
And the beginning of this year,
I was on track to go higher,
at least $2.5 million.
Had all these purchase orders,
then COVID hit.
And so what's happened
since COVID?
How has that
affected you?
Yeah, I mean, obviously,
it's had a big impact
when all the stores are closed.
At this point, our sales to date
are $760,000,
and I expect this year
we'll be at $1.2 million.
You know what, Nancy?
Congratulations
on what you've done.
It's just not a space
that I really want to be in.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
I'm thinking about it.
I like it as a customer.
But just not for me.
I wouldn't see any passion
in trying to get it out there
or helping,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
The problem is, you never built
your digital direct to customer
while you were experiencing
this growth in retail.
Exactly.
I'm interested,
but my offer's gonna be sharky
in the sense that I don't know
what I don't know
about the digital pivot, okay?
Okay, alright.
And that's where I'm interested
in blowing it up,
because I feel at risk in retail
for all kinds of products.
I'll give you the $300,000
for 25%.
?Ooh!
?Mnh!
?Okay.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Hey, it's what
I'm comfortable with.
[ Both laugh ]
Ouch, but thank you.
You can counter, Nancy.
I'd like to counter.
Go ahead.
I'd like to counter.
Well, Nancy,
before you counter,
the dough,
it's speaking to me.
Yay.
The longer I play with it,
it's like,
"Make an offer."
I love the mission.
Thank you.
I can relate to it.
I'll make you
the same offer.
I'll give you the $300,000...
Okay, thank you.
...for 25%.
I would love to work
with either one of you,
but 25% is just more
than I can do.
I would like to counter
to each of you at 10%.
Good for you.
Don't give up your company.
Ohh!
No, I don't want
to give up.
Says the woman
who will give you nothing.
I gave her good advice.
You sure did.
That's wonderful.
It's worth exactly that.
I'm gonna stick
at the 25%.
And I think I can do
a better job for you than Kevin.
I think I have more products
with better databases,
but I'm worried
about a lot of other things.
I'm worried
about competition.
I don't think
we need to worry.
Okay, well,
I'm not gonna worry ??
I just feel like Pinch Me,
it's just gonna grow.
If you want to do the deal
at 25%, I'll do it.
Or you can do it
with Robert.
I'm not gonna
change my offer.
You're not gonna change
from 25%?
Okay, Robert,
every single year,
we've been profitable,
profitable.
And this is just with retail
that's coming back.
Nancy, you're great.
Thank you.
I think if you had
more of an e?commerce strategy,
I would have a little more
wiggle room...
That's why I'm here.
...'cause I think
it's gonna be a lot of work.
No disrespect
to what you've built.
Understood.
I'll do it at 20%.
You'll do it for 20%?
There you go.
Now it gets interesting.
Alright,
I'll do it at 20%.
Ooh! Now it's getting
more interesting.
I love this.
I love this direction.
Daymond and Robert...
how about...
17%?
I'm not going into
a bidding war with Daymond.
I already came down by the 5%,
which I wasn't going to.
Can you come just a smidgen
down more?
Um...
I feel really good
at 20%.
Do you hear how calm
my voice is?
Can we move you down
just a smidgen from 20%?
Just a smidgen,
and we'll be good.
Just a smidgen.
Oh, my God,
you're such a good negotiator.
But I mean it.
You're so calm.
And I'm like, "Ohh."
I was like, "I'm not
going down below 25%."
Now I'm at 20%, and I'm like,
"Should I go down?"
You are good, lady.
Thank you.
I think we gave you
a valuation
that we all feel
comfortable with generally,
and I came in at 20% because...
I appreciate that.
...I just appreciated you
and I already
brought it down for you.
Thank you,
and I do appreciate it.
Just a smidgen?
So I would just love
to stay at 20%.
Can we ??
Just a little more?
I'm gonna stay at 20%.
I already came down the 5%
because I believe in ??
I just think it's such
a great opportunity.
You got to make a decision,
Nancy.
Okay.
One of those moments.
Okay.
Alright,
you're all amazing.
I want this more than anything.
I really do. So...
Robert, I will gladly
accept your deal.
Thank you.
And thank you, Daymond.
Cuban: Well done.
I'm so calm that I'm not
gonna throw this at you.
[ Laughter ]
Congratulations.
Congrats.
Cuban: Well cone.
Bye.
That's a rock?star partner,
Robert.
Before I walked in, Robert's
the one I wanted to work with,
and even though
he wouldn't budge from 20%
and it was 5% more
than what I wanted,
I felt that he was so worth it.
So I'm thrilled
to be working with him.
