Hi, Sharks.
My name is Beth Fynbo.
I'm from Rochester, Minnesota,
But Lori is interested in Beth's
baby place mat, Busy Baby.
Greiner:
I'm gonna give you an offer.
It'll be
a little aggressive
because we just did a licensing
deal with my Baby Toon.
With Munchkin.
Yes, with Munchkin.
You know, I have
a great partnership with them,
Well, Beth, let me add
some clarity to it.
Her offer
is substantially better
than the offer
I was gonna make.
Wow. Beth, you are
the real deal.
Nice.
There's no question.
I'm the real deal.
I'm doing this.
I mean, you are a rock star.
I don't say that very often
'cause it is tough
to launch a baby product ??
tough.
I very much appreciate
the compliment.
Really tough, so I'm out.
Lori ??
Cuban: Don't sell yourself
short, Beth.
Lori, will you do this deal
for 15%?
I would love to do this
with you for 15%.
I can't go past 15%.
Wow.
I just can't.
For me,
the bottom line would be 18%.
I can't do it.
I can't.
Whoa!
Good for you, Beth.
I know what I've done.
I love when an entrepreneur
sticks to their guns.
Greiner: You could pursue it
on your own.
But I don't think
that you would get as big
?Congratulations, Beth.
?Good luck.
?Thank you.
?Fantastic job.
?Good luck to you.
?Thank you, guys.
?I am rooting for you.
?Thank you.
?Congrats, Beth.
?Thanks.
?Fantastic.
Fynbo: It's hard to walk away,
but I know the value
that I'm gonna get
from the things
that are upcoming for Busy Baby.
Lori would have been
amazing to work with.
She really would have been.
