Hi, Sharks.
My name is Beth Fynbo.
I'm from Rochester, Minnesota,
and I'm here seeking $250,000
But Lori is interested in Beth's
baby place mat, Busy Baby.
Greiner:
I'm gonna give you an offer.
It'll be
a little aggressive
because we just did a licensing
deal with my Baby Toon.
With Munchkin.
Yes, with Munchkin.
You know, I have
a great partnership with them,
and I think that this would be
a really great product for them.
So I'm gonna offer you
the $250,000,
but I'd like 20%.
Whoa! People are gonna
stop having children
with that kind
of equity ask.
And the goal ??
the goal would be
to go to Munchkin
and see if they would do
a licensing deal with us.
But they would be
doing the retail.
Yeah.
They would be doing
the manufacturing.
I mean, it's kind of
a nice thing.
You sit back
and watch the money roll in,
but they do take over.
Would you be willing
to do it for 10%?
10%?
Well, Beth, let me add
some clarity to it.
Her offer
is substantially better
than the offer
I was gonna make.
And that's just
from my experience
Wow. Beth, you are
the real deal.
Nice.
There's no question.
I'm the real deal.
I'm doing this.
I mean, you are a rock star.
I don't say that very often
'cause it is tough
to launch a baby product ??
tough.
I very much appreciate
the compliment.
Really tough, so I'm out.
And you're out.
I get it. I get it.
Lori ??
Cuban: Don't sell yourself
short, Beth.
Lori, will you do this deal
for 15%?
I would love to do this
with you for 15%.
I can't go past 15%.
Wow.
I just can't.
For me,
the bottom line would be 18%.
I can't do it.
I can't.
Whoa!
Good for you, Beth.
I know what I've done.
I love when an entrepreneur
sticks to their guns.
Greiner: You could pursue it
on your own.
But I don't think
that you would get as big
of an up?front
sum of money and royalty
as if you're with me.
Negotiating
is my sweet spot.
I mean,
I'm really good at negotiating.
Can you negotiate yourself
down to 15%?
Yes,
what a great response!
Yes!
?I love that.
?Please.
?Congratulations, Beth.
?Good luck.
?Thank you.
?Fantastic job.
?Good luck to you.
?Thank you, guys.
?I am rooting for you.
?Thank you.
?Congrats, Beth.
?Thanks.
?Fantastic.
Fynbo: It's hard to walk away,
but I know the value
that I'm gonna get
from the things
that are upcoming for Busy Baby.
Lori would have been
amazing to work with.
She really would have been.
I'm very confident
in myself and my plans
and what I'm doing,
and I really think I can do it.
I just wasn't willing
to give up 18%.
