Hi, Sharks.
My name is Phil Wong.
And I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
Thank you, Lori.
Okay, so let's
talk about this, Phil.
Phil, let me ask
a couple questions.
Yeah.
Do you think
you have too many SKUs?
Because that's
a challenge ??
you know, trying to get
just that much shelf space.
Like, for me,

So, Phil,

Wong: Gosh.
I mean, I would be honored
to officiate this wedding.
Greiner: Good job.
Phil, we're really excited
to work with you.
We are very excited about you.
We are going to crush it.
Wong: Thank you.
Crush it.
I'm so excited.
If we don't create
a whole new category
and dominate that category,
I'll be really disappointed.
We'll make it happen.
Thank you, guys.
?Phil, congratulations.
?Yeah, congrats.
Oh, my gosh.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Oh.
Wow, that was not what
I was expecting to happen.
So we came out
with both Daniel and Mark.
I mean, both of those are like
two huge business idols for me.
And so I'm kind of fanboy?ing
right now.
It's gonna be a game changer for
our business, that's for sure.
Narrator: Earlier this season,
Angie Kupper and Matt Mundt
made a deal with Mark Cuban
and Lori Greiner
for Hug Sleep,
a swaddle for adults.
You got yourself a deal.
