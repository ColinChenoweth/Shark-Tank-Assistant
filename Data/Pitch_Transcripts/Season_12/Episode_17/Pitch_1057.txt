Daniel Lubetzky, the founder
of the groundbreaking
snack company KIND
returns to the Tank.
Your product
has to be your hero,
Let's talk about
how the sausage gets made.
?Together, we can...
?Change chilling forever.
You didn't come into
the Dolphin Tank.
I so want to
rip you to pieces.
I'm dying to rip you
to pieces.
What?!
Narrator: First into the Tank
is a way for carnivores
to eat a little healthier.
Let's talk about how
the sausage gets made.
So many Americans
want to eat less meat,
whether it's for their health,
for our planet,
or for animal welfare.
But it's no secret that most
aren't ready to go vegetarian.
So why are we stuck
with an all?or?nothing choice
when we go
to the grocery store?
We're meeting in the middle.
Introducing Misfit Foods,
a line of delicious sausages
by putting more delicious food
on the dinner table,
because we believe
that change can taste good,
one link at a time.
So, Sharks, don't miss out
on this one.
250K for 5% of our company.
Wow.
Sharks, in front of you,
we have our sausages
prepared three different ways.
The first is my favorite.
on a bun with the fixings.
Greiner: Wow.
The Citrus Kale is delicious.
Thank you.
I'm so glad to hear it, Lori.
Really good.
One thing that I noticed
that I really like
is that your sodium
is lower
than the typical
chicken sausages that I buy.
Phil, who's the market
you're going after?
Like, are you trying to get
people that are meat eaters
to eat less meat?
I think the proof
is kind of in the pudding.
We're in our first full year
in market right now,
I grew up in a family
of immigrants.
So my mom is from Indonesia.
My dad is from Macao.
was there a way to use delicious
food to help the environment?
with the six other guys
I was living with at the time.
Really?
Yeah, they weren't
too happy about it.
Did you raise money
to do this?
Yeah. So we've raised
$2 million to date.
?Hello.
?Wow.
?What?
We're here to not hit
a single or a double, right?
We're here to hit a home run.
So what was your last valuation
of the company at?
So the last valuation
was $4 million.
Well, we haven't
even talked about
to the grocery store.
Our cost is about
$2.91 a unit.
Okay, so that's
your biggest challenge.
but I don't know
if I believe in the trend.
I think consumers
want to go
one way or another.
You might be right,
but I don't share that vision.
I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
So your valuation
seems a little bit rich.
Mr. Wonderful, could you, like,
soften him up for me?
?Soften him up?
?Well, I would gladly do that.
O'Leary: I mean, you've
obviously done multiple rounds
at valuations
lower than this.
Well, there's
your first haircut.
Man, I shaved my head
like two weeks ago.
I can't afford
to lose any more of this.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: I think good product
speaks for itself, right?
It's gonna sell.
I do wonder if people will start
knocking you off like crazy.
I think it's so smart
that I think you kind of
have to race to the market.
Lubetzky:
Mm?hmm. Mm?hmm.
So I'm gonna
give you an offer.
It's gonna be
a little bit sharkier.
I'm gonna go $250,000,
but I'm gonna ask
for 18%.
Lori,
thank you for that offer.
these would have ??
this would be too much, right?
but they will never beat
the working horse.
So do you want to try
to do something together?
Okay, so...
How about $250,000 for 15%,
two Sharks.
Two of us.
Never has
happened before.
Wow.
This is the first time
we're getting married.
You're getting a haircut
no matter what happens.
There you go.
You get a guy that doesn't
eat your product
You would be a fool not to walk
out with one of these offers.
Which Shark or Sharks
do you want to go with?
The valuation is a little rich.
I'm wondering if we could bring
you two in at 300K for 15%.
300K for 15%?
O'Leary:
That's not crazy.
I would do that.
You've got a deal.
Done.
?Congratulations.
?Whoo!
I would hug you, but
we'd have to quarantine
for two more weeks.
Let's see what
they're up to now.
Since "Shark Tank," our lives
have flipped upside down.
Before "Shark Tank,"
we had been in business
for about 16 months.
We sold $490,000
in total sales,
which is about
5,500 Sleep Pods.
The night we aired,
something magical happened.
We sold over $2 million
in sales,
well over
25,000 Sleep Pods.
Kupper:
Our focus quickly shifted to,
"How are we going to be able
to fill all these orders?"
Before airing
on "Shark Tank,"
our manufacturer
was able to make
about 200 to 300 units
per week.
We were able
to scale production
to well over
10,000 units a week.
In just three
short months,
We've done over
$4.1 million in sales
If you can't sleep,
then everything else craters.
Especially during
these stressful times.
Greiner: The future
for this business is bright.
Right now,
they can direct to consumer,
but in the future,
they can also fulfill to stores
They've developed new products,
There's no reason why you can't
be a $100 million company.
I have no doubt
we'll get there.
I only have two words.
Let's go!
[ Laughs ]
Kupper:
There's a huge connection
There are so many people
out there dealing with PTSD,
is one of the best things
that we can do
to take care of ourselves.
The last year has been
an incredibly stressful
time for everyone,
so it's been really
rewarding to us
Oof. The Chiller
doesn't need ice.
Man! I had to stop
at the inconvenience store.
Now I got to
break this up.
I put ??
[ Grunting ]
I put the Chiller
in my freezer last night,
loaded my favorite drinks
before I left,
These drinks will be cold
in...mnh?mnh?mnh, a while.
Well, sure.
Look at the size of it.
Yeah.
It's super heavy, too.
The Chiller is the future
of portable beverage cooling.
Enjoy hours of ice?cold drinks
anywhere.
to support clean water projects
around the world.
You can either do cans.
Yep.
Or you take the cans out
like I just did.
from macho men
on the Internet.
"Only three beers?"
The Chiller cools three beers
or a bottle of wine at a time.
But the point is,
if I want to take a case ??
As soon as you have a cold one,
you take a cold one out.
You put another one in
for cooling.
?How long does this stay cold?
?Six hours.
?Six hours.
?What were the sales?
We've done $111,000
to date.
That's over
the last two years.
We started with
a Kickstarter campaign.
We did $51,000
on Kickstarter.
Cuban: What's it cost?
Okay, the Chiller you have
in front of you,
our product cost
is awful.
Never, ever start
any type of response ??
?Let me get there.
?"It's awful."
Let me get there.
That was about $18 a unit
to build.
Now, then we had to import
the units, $3.50 a unit.
So now you're up
to 22 bucks.
We added those sleeves,
added another $11, okay?
Now you're up to $32?
All the way up to $37
for that one that you have
in front of you.
To make it?
?To make it?
?The cost?
?Yes.
?Wow.
?$37?
Let me get there.
That was our first run
of inventory, okay?
The one you have
in front of you,
we're actually selling those
currently into retail at a loss
at $30
to prove out the market.
This is the first sustainable
portable beverage chiller.
When you say this is
the only sustainable cooler,
I'm not so sure
that that's true.
Herjavec: Yeah, I don't know
if I buy that.
Like, I get I'm saving
the plastic bag.
But look at the amount
of plastic that's in this.
That is built
to last forever.
All the materials
are also recyclable.
No, but so is the plastic,
isn't it?
Only 9% of thrown?away plastic
is recycled.
Lubetzky: Give me the reason why
you decided to go in this space.
Because you sound like fun guys,
great energy.
Of all the things you could
have done in the world,
why did you choose you wanted
to make the umpteenth cooler?
we were building this
on the side
on the nights,
on the weekends.
Are you still working
at your jobs?
We're not.
No, we quit them two years ago.
This is full time for this?
We've been doing this full time
for two years.
We are very happy doing this.
We believe in the mission.
But you guys had
promising careers.
There is a massive amount
of plastic waste.
You probably got stock options.
You're making great money.
You both have fantastic jobs
in growth companies.
We're passionate
about this project.
You look from the boat.
We felt the need for it
ourselves.
It's a cooler
pulling you in
?The cooler draws you in.
?That's right.
That's right. We love it.
Then the boat crashes
into the rocks.
I actually went to get
some anger management therapy.
Because I didn't
want to be mean.
I wanted to be
the new Mr. Wonderful.
Kevin, remember your therapy,
please.
$160,000 for 15%.
?Oh, my God.
?$1 million.
Plus more, even.
?Are you out of your ??
?We're not out of our minds.
Why?
Would you like to talk
about the valuation?
Why would you do this?
I mean,
this stuff is tchotchke.
They give it away
at beer companies.
There's a million coolers.
Stop, stop. Oh.
It's sustainable.
It's convenient.
I so want to rip you
to pieces.
I'm dying to rip you
to pieces.
What are you gonna do,
Kevin?
You must stop this.
There is no hope.
This is a really bad idea.
Coolers? Why?
I don't even buy
the sustainability thing.
There's all kinds of plastic
in this thing.
I hate it.
I'm out.
Cuban: Guys, look, first of all,
your presentation sucked.
The next time you sell it,
sell it.
Don't make it worse.
if you're giving these guys
reason to go on.
Lubetzky: I do not doubt that
you care about the environment,
about that stuff,
but your product
has to be your protagonist.
Your product
has to be your hero,
The social mission
can never be your crutch.
The social mission can never be
what you go to for a lifeline.
It's not a crutch.
It's our mission.
It's not.
It truly is our mission.
It's the reason we're committed
to doing this.
Seriously, it's the reason
we're committed to doing this.
We could've stayed, right?
We had done the math.
We could have been millionaires
in our early 30s.
Not just about the money.
That's not
what we wanted to do.
We wanted to make a difference
in the world,
?Why?
?It doesn't.
?The reason ??
It's not just because we want
to make a difference.
It's also because
we want to learn.
It's about learning.
It's about building.
Brian, you be the nicest guy
in the world.
But your story has so many
lapses of credibility for me.
"Who's your competitor?"
"It's ice."
Like, come on, seriously?
We know there's a lot
of competition in
the cooler market.
We're not shying
away from that.
No, not at all.
This is the problem
we're trying to solve.
Then the story pivots
to sustainability,
then you don't have to buy
the bag of ice.
...for you to get
the cost down.
Yep.
People, when it's affordable
enough, they're gonna buy in.
We will.
So I wish you the best.
I personally am out.
Cuban: Congrats on what
you've accomplished.
?Good luck, guys.
?Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Alright.
Being on "Shark Tank,"
great experience,
but they
don't know everything.
We already have
retail partnerships in place.
We're gonna put our products
on shelves
Why would you encourage them
to go on with this?
'Cause I think it's
a good?looking product.
It really is
a good?looking product.
Oh, come on.
Greiner: So how long was your
anger management classes?
Together: Hi!
We are the Clark family!
I'm Manya.
I'm John.
I'm Juju.
I'm Lyla.
Our family has always loved
going to the beach together,
but we wanted to catch waves
on the same board.
Whether you're a child
going into the ocean
for the very first time,
an adult that's been intimidated
by the waves,
or a teenager that just wants
to try something new,
John:
Now, that's family fun.
Our patent?pending
dynamic air design
allows us to make a board this
big fit into a bag that small.
You just show up at the beach,
you pump it up,
so you can capture
all of the action
Together: Help us bring the fun
to everyone.
Now, we want to ask Robert
if you'd like to come
Yes, we provide
the pump, as well.
You can
hold on to the ones ??
Pretend like you're
catching a wave,
'cause there's waves
right behind you.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Ooh!
If I had my little one,
he would be here or she.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
We're side by side
in the video, as well.
It's super fun.
Like, it feels very solid.
Wow. So you guys
are this great family.
I'm just curious, like,
who's running the business?
What's the story?
Well, we each
have our function.
I'm in charge of manufacturing,
operations,
logistics,
the website.
I'm the oldest sister.
I just love your unity.
Did you consciously
design something
that you could
involve your daughters in?
We had ?? As a family growing up
in San Clemente, California,
we had participated in so many
different water activities.
There's actually a picture
of us,
Herjavec: Oh, my gosh.
That is the cutest thing ever!
Greiner: Do you have
a background in this?
But by the time
I was 21,
I had my industrial
engineering degree
for having the company
is to be able to spend time
with our kids.
with the pump,
all?in?one?fun kind of idea.
This is all you need.
Throw it in the back
of your scooter, your bike,
take it to the beach.
That's the selling proposition
to me,
because there are
other products like this.
Greiner: There are?
Don't be such a killjoy.
Herjavec: No, there are not.
Shut him down.
John: Well, what is unique
about our product,
We call it dynamic air design
because the design
is what we've perfected.
O'Leary:
But has anybody else done this?
Done this exact thing?
No.
John:
So we designed the board,
as well as the camera mount.
Cuban: Who goes out selling,
or is it only online?
How does the whole
sales process work?
Was that all on Kickstarter,
the $43,000?
$31,000 was from
the Kickstarter,
So the average boogie board
is 59, 69, 79 bucks,
depending on size,
under $100 for sure.
Are you getting a lot of
pushback on that price point?
Alleanna:
That's a great question.
What we found is that
this is comparable
to low?cost surfboards,
it's not like every person
needs their own.
Herjavec: Have you taken it
to the surf shops
Part of the sales come
from the four retail stores
that we've already got
carrying our product.
What do you
need the money for,
Well, our plan is,
we do feel that the opportunity
But how are you
gonna get there?
Your biggest challenge
will be distribution, that's it.
People will buy the product
if they see it.
I will contact them personally
like we did.
But, guys, you can't sell enough
just demo'ing the boards.
While you're gonna get
some retail distribution,
online will be where you
make your most money.
You know, you guys know
Tower Paddle Board.
What made it work
was the marketing ability,
the fact that Stephan
is just an expert at SEO, right?
That's what made it sell.
You've done this part.
But the part you don't have
is that SEO,
that sales skill, right?
It's not that you can't figure
out, but you're not there yet.
Well, listen, I love the name.
I think it's fabulous.
It's intuitive.
You know just what it is.
But I feel like
with this product,
I think there's gonna be
better Sharks up here for you.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
O'Leary:
We've had water sports products
in here for over a decade,
From Season 1.
We've all watched it
as a family.
Do you remember a family
that came out,
They were
the California dream.
But you have something
they didn't.
John: Right.
You have a patent.
I mean, for me,
that's really key.
But I need a bigger chunk
of the company.
'Cause it was a lot of work.
So I'll give you the $100,000,
but I want...
Well, I don't want 10%, John.
How much do I want?
Well, there's only
one other Shark left.
It's Daniel.
Daniel, what do you think?
Lubetzky: I'll tell you
my thoughts on this.
I love you guys.
This is a sport
that my family enjoys.
My wife loves this stuff.
My kids love this stuff.
I'm kind of the loser
in the family that's bad at it.
I have online expertise.
We sell over $100 million
online.
If Robert would like me to come
in on this to provide support,
I think we could do it for 25%
for the two of us.
25% isn't enough.
Would you be willing to meet
in the middle at 30%?
No, no.
?So mean!
?You get Daniel ??
You didn't come
into the Dolphin Tank.
We want to stay
on the Shark Tank.
They're both immigrants.
They came to this country
as young kids, just like I did,
Herjavec:
What a fun family.
It's a fun business
in the front, what people see.
On the back, it's kind of like
the tech business.
Cuban: Hard. Hard.
It's hard.
Hard.
You guys are in
for a lot of work, baby.
It's our first deal together,
Daniel.
?It's exciting.
?It's exciting.
The stress of shopping
with a baby?
The struggle is real,
right?
I mean, there's nowhere
to put the groceries.
You definitely don't want
to take the baby
out of the car seat.
What if they're sleeping?
What about germs?
Yuck!
Groceries or baby?
There's only room for one.
Not anymore.
We have the solution ??
the Totes Babies
Car Seat Carrier.
Shop with ease
Simply lay the Totes Babies
over the shopping cart...
adjust the arm grips...
...put in the car seat.
Take it easy, Dad.
He's fragile.
Alright.
Adjust the safety straps.
Well, the idea came about
with my first son.
You know,
being a new parent,
you just want to get out
of the house at some point.
Then I'd have massive anxiety
when I couldn't get any
of my shopping list done.
I put the basket down.
Not the best artist.
The moms were like,
"What is that?
really thought it'd be
the real deal.
Tell us, though.
Like, 40 patents?
It was a business
for store fixturing.
So we made products
for all the big?box stores,
hardware stores.
I just can see stuff.
I know a lot
of manufacturing processes.
How do you
get it out there?
Social media.
We have Facebook ads.
We have Instagram ads.
We have marketing through Amazon
that we work with.
How much have you spent
on advertising so far?
The total's got to be
about $20,000.
We just started boosting
our Facebook.
Oh, that's it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We just started boosting it
the past couple months.
The way you were talking,
I figured ??
No, we've been taking
baby steps, doing experiments.
So you guys
are a team together,
daughter, father ??
really great.
Are you doing this
full time?
Yes, I am
doing it full time.
I'm actually so grateful
for Totes Babies.
Being a mom is
one of the hardest jobs.
But having this business
gives me a purpose
So it's been awesome.
Yeah, you can tell the respect
you have for him,
because when you just
look at him, you're beaming.
I've looked up to him
in so many different ways,
not only as a businessperson,
but as a dad.
I just hope to be
more like him someday.
She's a tremendous
daughter.
So, guys, have you gone
to grocery stores at all
then it's an obvious use
at a time of need.
But honestly, this is not
my type of business,
I did have a KIND bar
the other day, though, so...
[ Laughter ]
But I think the grocery business
is massive.
If you can capture
a percentage of that,
that would be a big,
big business.
Right.
I think I can really
help you with that.
Okay.
I'll make you an offer.
$100,000 for...25%.
I say let's blow it up
at the corporate level.
Let's go there.
That's what I do.
Okay.
Okay.
So my thought is, I did
a deal with Baby Toon last year,
a little ?? At 7 years old,
she created a baby spoon,
They're the number?one
baby?product people
in the world.
I think it would be great to do
some type of licensing to them.
So I will give you
the $100,000 for...
25% also.
Congratulations.
You got two offers.
?What are you gonna do?
?You got three offers.
I'll do it for 22%.
?Whoa!
?There you go.
The fun is building.
for their baby carrier holder
for shopping carts,
Totes Babies.
You got three offers.
I'll do it for 22%.
?Whoa!
?There you go.
The fun is building.
Lubetzky: 22%.
O'Leary: Three offers
in a tough category.
I think it's gonna be so much
fun working with you guys.
Valiulis: Yeah.
If he'll have me,
I'll go down to the 22%.
No, no, no, no, if we do it
together, it's at least 25%.
Okay, you're right.
Let's do it together.
but may not be
the best partner.
Oh, my God!
?I feel I'm your best partner.
?Wait a second.
"The other Sharks are bad.
I'm great."
I work with my entrepreneurs.
I hustle.
You can call me
anytime day or night.
Valiulis: Yeah, we know.
We hustle, too.
with every retailer
in the nation?
I will go down to 22%
if Daniel will go down to 22%.
They were about to say,
"Lori, you have a deal."
So, Lori, why are you
letting them out of it?
Lori, will you go down to 22%?
I'm gonna stick
because I think I'm worth it.
Now bringing Lori on
as another mentor
is just gonna skyrocket us
to the next level.
I just feel so proud of him.
I feel so proud of us.
