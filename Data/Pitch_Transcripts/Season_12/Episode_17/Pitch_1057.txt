Hey, Sharks.
This is Brian.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to buy ice.
And we proudly donate a portion
of every purchase
So, Chase and I have had
good jobs out of school.
He went to work at Google,
and I went to work at Apple.
And two years into that ??
What'd you do
for Google and Apple?
I was in sales.
I was in finance.
Yeah, no one questions that.
