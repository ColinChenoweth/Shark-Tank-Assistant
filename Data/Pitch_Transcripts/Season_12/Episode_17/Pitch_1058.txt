and it has to stand
on its own merits.
It's time to make shopping with
babies fun, safe, and simple.
On the Tandem Boogie,
every wave is a party wave.
?Whoo! Whoo!
?Waves right behind you.
?Are you out of your ??
?We're not out of our minds.
?Your presentation sucked.
?We're onto something.
And I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
We thought, why can't we
put veggies <i>and</i> meat
into a product
that people would love?
Well, Sharks,
that's where we come in.
that are half chicken
and half veggies and spices.
Our three flavors
will knock your socks off.
And they're made
with sustainability in mind,
helping people eat less meat
It's our Sweet Potato Andouille
mac and cheese.
Next,
our Kale Chimichurri tacos.
And last is a classic
squash Italian
And the other thing, too,
is that we have about
40% less cholesterol
than your typical
chicken sausage, as well.
And that's something that
our consumers really care about.
Absolutely,
and, you know,
and we're on track
for $1.2 million in sales.
?Wow.
?Wow.
And so, you know,
a good portion of those people
are just, you know,
your pure carnivores.
What's your actual sales
to date?
So we've done
just under 800K to date.
How are you selling it,
direct or through retail?
We're about 20%
brick and mortar,
and that's Whole Foods,
and 80% online.
How did you come up with this?
What's your background?
So, you know, food's always been
a really huge part of my life.
And so my connection
to Indonesia and Macao
when I was growing up
was through food.
And when I got to college
at Georgetown,
I started learning more
about just, like,
how huge our environmental
footprint is with our food.
So I started wondering,
And so I started Misfit in
the kitchen that I was sharing
what it sells for
and what it costs yet.
So typically, we're selling
for $4.13 a unit
?And what do they sell it for?
?What do they retail it at?
And so they're retailing it
for anywhere from $5.99
to $7.99 a unit.
Now, our gross margins work out
to about 29%.
What's really important
to know about that
is that we hit break even
in May of this year,
and I think that points
to the fact
that we don't have to
market this product a ton
and, you know, spend a bunch on
slotting fees, promotional fees
to get people
to buy this product.
Are you spending money
on marketing today?
Very little. It's less
than 5% of our first revenue.
Good for you.
The refrigerated
and frozen categories
have eluded me
in making a lot of money.
I've made investments
in it.
It's burned up
a lot of my hours,
which is valuable to me,
and I haven't really had
a huge hit with it yet.
I'm out.
I'm a vegetarian,
and I think it's innovative,
And then you come
in the Shark Tank
to get a premium investor
and charge them a premium,
which is not correct,
because a Shark brings value
that an ordinary investor can't.
Could you add
"Shame on you"?
If you want to get
an investor,
you're gonna have to
take a haircut.
That's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna give you...
$250,000 for 15%.
And I'm thinking
that's generous.
I'm not a curry guy
and I'm not ??
Citrus Kale,
maybe I'll try it.
But, you know,
if it was simpler ??
I just want a sausage,
you know,
where I could put it on a bun
and eat it at a cookout
and know it's healthier
and lower?calorie.
Lubetzky:
Mark, you're so right.
This is incredibly important
for people to understand.
Every time my team
and I innovate
and we come up with all these
esoteric ideas, they're fun,
And many entrepreneurs are
trying so hard to differentiate
and they don't build
that working horse.
Are you willing to do
just a workhorse product?
I had no idea you were
a chef, Mark ?? no idea.
I'm not a chef, but I know
how to dominate markets.
Are you gonna
make an offer?
Phil has offers on the table
from Daniel and Lori
for his half?chicken,
half?veggie sausage company,
Misfit Foods,
but Mark may also be interested.
Are you gonna make an offer?
Cuban: Yes.
and a chef to tell you
what to put in the sausage
that doesn't eat meat.
And he'll rewrite
your whole business plan.
to tell you what to do.
And a mentor who's done it
every step of the way
and who's gonna guide you.
and dominate that category,
I'll be really disappointed.
We'll make it happen.
Thank you, guys.
So we came out
with both Daniel and Mark.
I mean, both of those are like
two huge business idols for me.
And so I'm kind of fanboy?ing
right now.
It's gonna be a game changer for
our business, that's for sure.
Narrator: Earlier this season,
Angie Kupper and Matt Mundt
made a deal with Mark Cuban
and Lori Greiner
for Hug Sleep,
a swaddle for adults.
You got yourself a deal.
and have sold
over 44,000 Sleep Pods.
Sleep is everything
to everybody.
nationwide and globally.
and they've even developed one
for kids.
Hug Sleep will help men, women,
and children all sleep better.
Between you guys
and Lori and I,
between our physical health
and our mental health.
anxiety, insomnia,
and sensory issues every day,
and being able to get
a better night's sleep
that Sleep Pod has been able
to help thousands of people
at least get
a better night's sleep.
Our company is Chill Systems,
and this is the Chiller.
It's a portable beverage cooler
with freezing gel built in.
[ Footsteps approach ]
And...
and now they're ice?cold.
This chills many types
of cans and bottles,
even big bottles
like champagne.
This cooler
can hold all that.
Save time, money,
and the environment.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, that's bad.
[ Laughter ]
Good thing
we at Chill Systems
are offering
a more sustainable solution.
Choosing a Chiller reduces waste
of clean water
and single?use plastics.
And we proudly donate a portion
of every purchase
And you can, too.
Partner with us.
We're seeking $150,000
for 15% equity.
And together, we can...
Both:
Change chilling forever.
Sharks, you each have samples
complete with chilled drinks.
Cuban: Chill.
Greiner: So this doubles.
?And then it's for a bottle.
?That's right.
?Oh.
?It's incredibly versatile.
It only holds three cans.
I mean,
I don't know about you,
but I'll get through this
in about 45 minutes.
Sure, and, you know, Kevin,
we've heard that feedback before
I understand.
I understand.
And since then,
we've been able
to bring that cost
down to $18.
So, Chase and I have had
good jobs out of school.
He went to work at Google,
and I went to work at Apple.
And two years into that ??
What'd you do
for Google and Apple?
I was in sales.
I was in finance.
And so we were there
for about two years
before we came up
with this idea.
And so for the first
two years of this,
And are you making money
to sustain yourselves?
Not yet.
No, not profitable yet.
Not yet.
We have not taken a salary since
we left our jobs two years ago.
Do you want me to make a call
to get your jobs back?
No.
No.
And then you know that story of
the Sirens singing on the rocks?
[ Vocalizes ]
?We felt the need.
?And it's a cooler.
from your fantastic jobs
and stock options.
[ Vocalizes ]
And now you're here
with a cooler.
Who is your number?one
competitor?
?Ice.
?Ice? [ Chuckles ]
I want you to know, for this
Season 12 of "Shark Tank,"
And I am working very hard right
now to be a nice Mr. Wonderful.
I look at this
and I say to myself, "Okay.
I'm gonna take this
and put this thing in my freezer
for an extended period of time.
I guess I'll take out the roast
and the chicken that's there
and I'll put this in here,
and then I'm gonna take
three cans of beer ??
just three, not more."
?At a time.
?At a time.
?At at time.
?Three at a time.
And I'm going to go somewhere
with this thing.
Right.
$160,000.
Just stick to your features
and what sets you apart
so people truly
understand it quickly.
Sure.
So while I think
you got a shot,
it does everything
as advertised,
but for those reasons,
I'm out.
You are clinically insane
and it has to stand
on its own merits.
and this is our way to do it.
Cuban: Good. Good.
And we were at Google and Apple.
We had great jobs.
And we're thinking to ourselves
every night when we come home,
"We're not learning enough.
We're here at the office
and we're doing the tasks
that are being sent our way,
but we're not learning enough."
So it wasn't just about
making a difference.
and your product is made
of plastic, and ??
Plastic that's meant
to last forever and
is fully recyclable.
Come on. I throw this in ??
But if you use this product,
And then you're like, "Well,
that's not really the story.
It's about learning something.
I wasn't learning enough
at Apple and Google."
Look, putting all that aside,
it was a bad presentation.
It was a bad presentation.
I'm out.
Appreciate that.
Thank you, Robert.
Greiner: I think it's gonna
be really important...
Thank you for your feedback,
Robert.
And I think
that you have a shot.
What?!
Greiner: For me to invest,
it's not what I'm interested
in investing in.
So I'm sorry. I'm out.
Appreciate that.
Thank you for your feedback,
Lori.
Cuban: And then there's Daniel.
Lubetzky: I'm not 100% confident
this is a huge business.
But I'm very confident
that if you continue
pursuing your dreams,
you're gonna figure it out.
so customers can see them
and love them.
And the Sharks are gonna wish
that they invested.
Listen, I really worked on it.
And look, I've been great.
I'm really ??
I'm very ??
[ Laughter ]
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a company
that believes two
is better than one.
I'm Alleanna,
and this is Tandem Boogie.
We are from San Clemente,
California.
And we're seeking
$100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
So we created
the Tandem Boogie.
On the Tandem Boogie,
every wave is a party wave.
Take a look.
You can catch a wave
with anyone.
the Tandem Boogie
is for you.
You can surf it.
You can ride it front and back
or side by side.
?It takes two!
?It takes two!
and then you've got a board
with handles and a camera mount
and those memories
that will last forever.
So, Sharks, who wants to join
our Tandem Boogie family and...
and actually
try catching a wave.
?Hi. Sure.
?Alright.
Oh, you provide a pump,
as well?
So just grab onto
the handles.
And then I would hang on.
?Right.
?Yeah.
You can do two people
side by side, too?
?Yes, two people side by side.
?Adults?
John:
Yep, we go side by side.
And I'm in charge of marketing
and sales and social media.
And I'm the CFO, which stands
for Chief Fun Officer.
I make sure that our brand
stays in line with our vision.
And I'm
the creative director.
I'm in charge
of the merchandising.
Alleanna: I'm in charge
of community outreach
and then also making sure
everybody gets the job done.
all five of us
on one stand?up paddleboard.
Yes. Well, John and I always
said that whatever he can sell
I can make.
I actually originally came here
to United States
from Iran as a refugee.
and was working in a big
corporation in manufacturing.
Wow.
So I know how
to make products.
Wow.
And John was always
a salesperson.
So we decided
when Juliette was 6 months ??
we decided
to start a business,
and what we started
was a shelving business.
And it's been amazing
because our main object
And it's been a success.
We are still running it.
We do about $1,500,000
in sales per year.
?Wow.
?Good for you.
What do you
manufactured it for?
The landed cost
is $150.
O'Leary: $150?
And you sell it for how much?
Yes.
We sell it for $459.
?Ooh.
?Wow.
This idea of packaging it
into something portable
and then we consulted
with our attorney,
and we did file
for a patent,
a utility patent
on this design.
It has been submitted,
and that's for the whole design,
incorporating the handles,
the locations,
Well, it's been a bit different
this year due to the pandemic.
So we had to pivot
towards selling online.
And what we actually
ended up doing
was we launched
a Kickstarter campaign
as our first, like,
way of selling.
So we did that
for one month,
and we've done $43,000
in sales.
and that was between
June and July.
?Of this year?
?Yes.
?Oh, you're brand?new.
?We're brand?new.
?Oh, you're brand?new. Got it.
?Oh, okay.
and because you can have
two people on one board,
and places
where people rent?
Have you tried that?
and what do you
need a Shark for?
for Tandem Boogie is global,
and our plan is to grow.
We would like to have
25 accounts set up this year
so that we can reach
over $300,000 in sales.
We think that's realistic.
Based on my experience
in sales and marketing,
I know how to set up dealers,
I know how to set up accounts.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
So we're sorry that you're out.
We hope you reconsider.
Appreciate it.
Thanks.
and it's a tough grind
to get this to be a $5 million,
$10 million business.
And so I admire what
you've done, but I'm out.
Let me tell you
what I think.
Have you watched "Shark Tank"
for a while?
?Oh, yes.
?Oh, yes.
a dad with five sons
called Handboard?
?Yes.
?Yeah.
That was my investment.
So it was a cross between
a paddleboard and a skateboard.
And I learned a lot
with Handboards.
Well, Robert, it is
a Tandem Boogie concept,
two people, right?
So are you interested
in just going this alone
as a solo Shark,
or would you like to have
a Tandem Boogie partner
from the panel?
And I'm just being
completely sincere.
It is a lot of work,
and it's gonna take a long time.
$100,000 for 35%.
If Daniel wants to come in
as part of that, happy to do it.
I'd come in on that
if you guys ??
Let's go sell some
Tandem Boogie boards.
?Let's huddle up.
?Can we huddle up, guys?
?[ Laughs ]
?Real quick?
[ Indistinct talking ]
You can join
our Tandem Boogie family.
[ Cheering ]
Herjavec: Alright!
Daniel.
Congratulations, guys.
Well done.
Guys, congratulations.
?Thank you.
?See you guys.
[ Laughs ]
We got a deal, you guys!
Manya:
Well, Robert and Daniel are
a perfect fit for our family.
and made the American dream
come true.
And that's what
we're hoping for.
Fleischhauer:
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Lindsey Fleischhauer
from Naperville, Illinois.
And I'm Stan Valiulis
from Rockford, Illinois.
And we're the father/daughter
duo behind...
Both: Totes Babies!
Sharks, we're here
seeking $100,000
for 10% of our business.
How many parents have
dealt with this before?
And with a baby,
time is of the essence.
and check off everything
on your shopping list.
It's time to make shopping with
babies fun, safe, and simple.
Now, for our
demonstration, Dad?
?And shop away.
?Oh, wow.
Greiner: Oh.
Fleischhauer:
The Totes Babies works
on all different size
shopping carts
and holds up to 75 pounds.
What?!
It truly is shopping with babies
made fun, safe, and simple.
Alright, Sharks, who is totes
ready to jump in with us?
?Very innovative, no question.
?Yeah, very.
And that little scream
sounded a lot like Robert.
So I was impressed.
What?!
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Lindsey, did you
create this yourself?
And tell us how.
And so I'd get all doodled up
to get out.
And the light bulb
went off
when I was holding my big son
in his car seat,
holding the shopping basket,
and I couldn't get anything.
I was just like,
"I'm done."
And I kind of thought
of the idea and went to my dad.
I gave him
a very amateur drawing.
And he holds
over 40 patents.
?So I went to him.
?Oh, wow.
?Oh, wow.
And he sketched up
an amazing drawing
and actually made a prototype
out of adjustable curtain rods,
electrical tape,
and a drop cloth.
?And I used it at a store.
?Way to go, Dad.
It worked great.
Oh, my gosh," and I'm like,
"We're onto something."
I think once we saw it,
we thought we could really
make this into a real product.
I've worked with manufacturing
for most of my life,
And for me,
it's a lot of fun.
When did you found this company,
and what are your sales today?
We launched in August
of 2018.
And what are your sales,
Lindsey, in that time?
$220,000.
Cuban:
And what does each one sell for?
$39.95.
And what does it
cost you to make?
$9.90, with tariffs
and freight included.
?Wow.
?How do you sell it?
Is it all online,
or do you go through ??
We're on Amazon.
We're on buybuy BABY,
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
and we sell through
our website, as well.
It's a phenomenal idea.
Thank you.
And I'm with you,
and I have twins.
I know.
Literally.
And now we're up to
2,500 bucks a month.
And the acquisition cost
is 15%.
And I won't get emotional,
but working with my dad
has been so awesome
because he's been my mentor
my whole life, and...
Guys! But it's been
an amazing experience
because I am a mom
but I love to work.
and makes me
just feel awesome.
And I just knew, gosh,
if I ever thought of something,
who else would I want
to work with?
and asked them
to try to sell this?
You know, if you saw these
standing up in a grocery store
and there's a stack
and it's $29.95...
Yeah.
and there's, like,
a big placard, right,
and it shows just
a picture like that,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
Thank you.
O'Leary:
Listen, you guys are terrific,
but I don't think I can
add a lot of value here.
But very credible.
I applaud what you've done.
Thank you.
Thank you.
But I'm out.
Lindsey and Stanley,
I'm going to say
that your energy and your
charisma is really there,
and I think you're gonna
really figure this out.
I'm not sure that
I'm gonna be vital to you.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Lindsey, I think you guys
have done a great job
of getting it out.
and it's like a teething ring.
Yep.
We licensed to Munchkin.
Lindsey and Stan have
three offers on the table
?I'm back in.
?Well, you know what, Lindsey?
Herjavec: I'd love to have him
part of it.
So Daniel and I
will come in together.
We'll do it together,
Robert and I, for 25%.
Fleischhauer: $100,000 for 25%?
?Yes.
?That's awesome.
?But you get two Sharks.
?Lori?
And I am $100,000 for 25%.
And I think I like licensing
and selling and doing it all.
You can sometimes
get more Sharks
or you can sometimes
get more money
or less percentage, you know,
of equity stake,
Lubetzky: I do want to make sure
you understand
that KIND is available
in more retailers ??
I mean, we're in more
than 400,000 doors.
Everybody's amazing.
I'm just in shock
that we're here.
But you have to
make a decision.
?Guys, every single grocery ??
?Can I say I love you all.
Loved your KIND bars.
Love you, Robert.
But, Lori.
Hold one second.
Do you understand that KIND
and I have the relationships
And I think that
you will be so happy
that you did a deal
with me.
I want to be in it
to win it with you.
You have a deal!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yay!
Herjavec: Oh!
?Yay!
?Congratulations, you guys.
Lubetzky: You're gonna be
awesome, and best wishes.
This is a dream.
Thank you.
?Yeah. You guys are great.
?Thank you.
Whoo!
[ Squeals ]
I can't. I can't.
I can't, I can't, I can't.
Fleischhauer: My dad
has always been my mentor.
We've come so far,
and it's amazing.
