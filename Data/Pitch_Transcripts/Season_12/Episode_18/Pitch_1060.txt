Hi, Sharks.
My name is Ari Tolwin.
And I'm Joe Savino.
We're from New York,
and we're seeking
$1 million...
Oh.
...in exchange for 5%
of our business.
Oh.
Corcoran: Wow.
Whoa.
You got our attention.
Sharks, milk today means
something totally different
from what the milk man used
to deliver to our homes.
Sure, some of us
still drink cow's milk,
but most of us have switched
to almond milk, oat milk,
or even hemp milk.
But, Sharks,
that comes at a price.
Most of those milks
are hyper?processed,
filled with gums,
preservatives,
and fillers galore.
Well, Sharks,
that's where we come in.
Both: Moo?ve on over,
cow's milk.
Because making fresh,
dairy?free milk
just became
"udderly" easy.
Introducing...
Numilk.
We built a custom machine
for grocery stores
where shoppers can make
delicious, nutritious,
pure, dairy?free milk
at the push of a button.
We use
the best ingredients.
Organic almonds from Spain
for our almond milks.
A blend of organic cacao,
vanilla bean, and maple
for our chocolate milks.
And a whole lot more.
Our Numilks are homemade
without the mess or the fuss.
We're on a mission
to bring plant?based diets
and zero?waste lifestyles
to the world.
So, Sharks,
I just have one question.
Who wants to milk this deal
for all it's worth?
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, in front of you
are a flight
of delicious dairy?free milks
for each of you to try.
But before you do so,
Mark, you've mentioned
you're dairy?free.
Come on up and make some
fresh milk for yourself.
Sure.
so I'll know what it
tastes like in comparison.
Great.
So, just press
that almond milk button
and then "Start"
on the bottom.
So, the machine is actually
making it fresh.
It's not a concentrate
or anything else in there.
It's taking pure, organic
almonds from Valencia
and making the milk
right now.
That's fast.
That's cool.
Tolwin: Barbara, you're
a real?estate mogul.
You understand the value
of square footage.
I'll tell you
exactly what it is
in midtown Manhattan
for a street location.
It's $3,000 a foot
in a primary location.
Yep.
How big is that?
So,
it's eight square feet.
The machines average $50,000
per year, per machine.
And so, when you think
about it on a square f??
That's in revenue.
In revenue, yep.
And it's unmanned,
and we pay no rent
at all.
What does a machine cost?
The machines
are $30,000 each.
They'll come down
to $15,000 at scale.
John: You know, guys,
I think it's a genius idea.
Number one, you're
reducing grocery stores'
perishable loss,
right?
Yes.
Number two is, you're
attracting new customers.
I like that
whole concept.
But were you
in this area before
in traditional
business?
Yeah.
Like, tell us a little bit
about yourselves.
Yeah, so I come from
the food?and?beverage world.
Before this,
I did aviation catering
for commercial jets,
private jets.
So, if you guys
flew to New York,
you have eaten our food.
Then I started
my own co?packing company
doing food and beverages.
After that, I left,
and I started this with Ari.
I'm also a second?time
entrepreneur in the space.
I had a brand called
Happytree Maple Water.
I had national distribution
in about 8,000 stores.
Did you have a exit
on that water company?
No. I shut it down, actually,
after we started this.
Corcoran:
I have a question.
What would Mark pay for that
bottle of almond milk
that he took away?
Yeah, you'd pay $2
for the bottle.
That's a one?time charge.
And if you
brought it back,
you'd pay $3.99
to refill it.
Okay, it's $3.99
for the almond milk,
$2 for the bottle.
How much goes
to the grocery store?
Yep. So, the grocery store
takes about a third.
O'Leary: All right, so,
how much have you raised?
We've raised $12 million.
?Whoa!
?Oh!
?Wow!
What was the last
valuation?
Our last valuation
was $40 million pre?money.
So we've actually negotiated
with our investors in advance
to give you
a Shark?appropriate deal.
Guys, is there
a bigger picture here?
This is obviously
a big picture.
Yes.
Hit 'em, Joe.
So, this is our
countertop device.
Oh!
And this is the bottle
that goes with it.
Ooh!
Wow.
We took our
grocery machine,
we shrunk it down so it works
on your countertops.
So you can
have the best ??
Now, <i>that</i> right there
is a necessity
for the family, I think.
What is that going
to cost the consumer?
It's gonna be about
$85 landed.
That's your cost.
What was your plan to sell it
to them for, then?
$199.
Can you show us how
the small machine works?
This is actually just
a 3D rendering prototype.
O'Leary: Okay, guys,
let's get into the numbers.
Just the basics, please.
Yep.
Top line, bottom line.
Top line, bottom line.
Last three years.
Yeah.
So, 2018,
$40,000 of revenue.
One machine,
partial year.
What'd you lose?
Spent a lot on R&amp;D.
So we spent about
$2 million on R&amp;D in 2018.
Losses were 2 mil.
Correct,
approximately.
2019.
$320 topline.
We ended the year
with 10 machines.
How much did you lose
in 2019?
And then we spent
$3 million on R&amp;D.
So, $5 million
total losses so far.
Now we're getting
to some critical mass here.
Wow.
Yeah.
What happens
in the third year?
So, third year
is this year.
We would have ended the year
at about a $6 million year.
But because of coronavirus,
our launch with Kroger,
some growth with Whole Foods,
a launch with Gelson's,
and some other regional
retailers were delayed.
So, what do you think
the losses will be this year?
This year, it's gonna
be about $2 million,
as well, mostly R&amp;D ??
So, 7 mil
in the ground so far.
And how much cash
do you have in the bank?
$3.5 million.
John:
You projected $6 million,
but where do you think
you'll land now?
This year, we're gonna be like
400k by the end of the year.
In sales?
Yeah.
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You said you projected
$6 million for this year,
but you feel you're gonna
end at $400,000.
Yeah, so, we would have
ended it with 100 machines
at the end of the year.
Can I get your attention
just for a moment, please?
I've been sitting here
and listening to every word.
I still don't get it, and I'm
paying attention like crazy.
Actually, I'm sitting here
feeling like I'm back
in second grade
failing again...
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
...because I don't know
what the hell
the teacher's talking
about yet again.
You talk so much
that I can't grab
a single word.
I'm sure you've got
something good there.
I don't know what the heck
it is, but I'm out.
I'm confused, too.
I'm out.
Joe, what do you sell
the stainless?steel
commercial unit for?
$699.
And what do they
cost you to make?
300 bucks.
300 bucks.
O'Leary:
All right, guys, look,
I thought you were nuts
when you first walked out here,
but now I have
a different opinion.
You did a very good job
in presenting the opportunity.
Thank you.
I don't agree
with my fellow Sharks.
I get what you're doing.
It's extremely interesting.
but Kevin is interested
in Joe and Ari's
plant?based milk machine,
Numilk.
O'Leary:
I thought you were nuts
when you first
walked out here,
but now I have
a different opinion.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
I actually think there's
a huge fundamental demand
for your product,
and I love watching Mark
go nuts over plant?based stuff.
You know,
I'm a modified vegan.
I only eat vegan
on Tuesdays.
[ Laughter ]
So...
He's serious.
...the structure
is difficult here,
because you've already raised
so much capital.
I would stick this
in my venture debt fund,
and I do an offer
like this.
I will loan you
a million dollars
at 9 1/2% interest
for 3 years.
That will cost you
$8,000 a month,
and I will take 5% equity
that you offered.
You know, I don't know
what Mark's gonna do,
but it gets you
into my sphere
of the Shark world,
and you can talk
to any of my entrepreneurs.
I do a hell of a job
on digital for them.
So if you're going
after consumers,
I can help you.
Yeah, so, first of all,
we really appreciate the offer.
We do believe you can bring
a lot of value to the business.
It's not what we had in mind
when we walked in here.
So we want to
at least get to engage ??
But it's an offer.
Absolutely.
It's great.
Absolutely.
And believe me,
I was not planning
on giving you a million bucks
when I first saw this thing.
Joe, you spoke up
at the right moment.
Congratulations,
guys.
[ Laughs ]
Good luck
with everything.
We accept
the congratulations,
but the work
starts now.
Exactly right.
packaging,
various other things.
Best of luck to you,
but this isn't for me.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you
very much.
You know, maybe it goes to
the bottom of an aquarium.
John: [ Laughs ]
Bunch Bikes is sharing
the joy of family biking
across the country.
So who wants to come along
for the ride
and make a bunch of money?
Whoa.
I want to ride.
Oh, actually, I know
you're into biking, Barbara.
I was going to invite you
to come down and...
Seriously?
Oh, great.
Yes. Absolutely.
We're going to have you ride
this red one.
I'm going to put Kevin
in the bike.
I'm so curious to see
how heavy it is.
It's going to be easier
than you think, actually.
Let me help you
with that.
Just put her.
[ Laughter ]
Barbara,
put me back into the Bunch,
or it's over between us.
Whoa.
It's stable, huh?
Yeah.
Is it assisted
electrically?
There is
an electric assist.
The electric assist,
it's easy.
Like, a lot
of our customers
are not necessarily
the most experienced bikers.
and so with
the electric,
I mean,
anybody can do it.
It has parking brakes.
That's a good thing.
Can you take it apart easily
to transport it?
No.
So, the advantage of this bike
is it's got a big box.
You can put a lot of stuff
in it, up to four kids,
picnic, grocery, cooler,
all of that.
But the disadvantage is
it does not come apart
easily for transport.
So your box to ship it's
gonna be pretty big, right?
It is big, and so we actually
only ship these bikes
fully assembled.
We use a motorcycle
shipping company.
That should be
very expensive, though.
It is expensive ??
$450 to ship.
?Ooh.
?Wow.
Yes, but it is less expensive
than shipping
the big, cardboard boxes
to the customer
and then having them...
?Assemble it.
...pay a bike shop
to assemble it.
They're gonna bill
that customer $300.
It's not necessarily
the most capital?efficient way
for an investor to work,
or at least not for me.
And then I had
to pay tariffs on them.
We get the bikes, open up
that container.
It's like, a flood of humidity
just hits you.
And we knew something
was wrong.
Oh, that's got to be horrible.
We open up the bikes. Water's
pouring out of the motors.
And it's like, it's toast.
Oh, no.
Like, whole container lost.
Get that money back?
Somebody else could have, like,
shipped those bikes out
to customers, but, like, no.
Like, we're gonna do right
by our customers.
I'm gonna take the hit.
That's the first time I had
to take a loan for the business.
You just said you took a loan
for the business.
Does the business
have any debt right now?
Yeah. So right now,
we have $50,000 in loan
that will be paid off
by the end of this year.
I've got $50,000
on credit cards.
And earlier this year,
in April,
I took out a $150,000 SBA loan
that I just put into inventory.
And did you raise any money
from any other investors?
Earlier this year,
I raised $95,000 ??
$45,000
from family and friends
and $50,000
from two angel investors.
Oh, I had no idea
you had borrowed so much money.
It was just because
I was willing to take that risk,
take that on,
but we're profitable.
We're making money.
I'm paying it all down.
I've never missed
a debt payment.
So that being said,
would you take my offer
of $250,000 for 40%?
It's ??
It's more than I could do.
I'm gonna counter
back at you.
I would take $250,000 for 20%.
