My name is Andy Watne,
and this is
my wife, Patty.
Hi.
We're from
Orland Park, Illinois.
Imagine, if you will,
a situation.
A situation
involving a shower ??
be it yours, a friend's,
or a mysteriously placed shower
like right here.
What would happen
if you pulled back the curtain
after your family member
or roommate
had taken a shower and...
all of a sudden,
Andy calls me
into the bathroom one day,
very concerned.
And he was like, "I think
there's something wrong
with our daughter.
Look at all this hair
on the shower wall."
And he had no idea
that when people have
longer hair and wash it,
that it comes out.
What are you gonna
use the money for?
Getting our name
out there,
getting people aware
that you have this problem.
We have the solution.
You have a solution
that people don't know
they need,
and that's the problem.
I think you have a lot more
things to figure out ??
Patty and Andy, where I see
the problem here is,
I don't think it's a big
enough problem to solve.
And the second thing is,
I would rather
have the hair on my wall
than see this thing
hanging out
with all the hair.
I think that's equally ugly.
And so, I'm not sold
on the product, quite honestly,
so I'm out.
I actually don't want
the HairyGrabster
to ever make it
to the market.
This is definitely competitive
to what I'm doing and selling
and have been for years.
I also don't think
it's a big enough problem.
This is never
going to work.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
I like things
that solve a big problem.
I think this is
a niche market,
and it could be a good
little business for you,
but I don't see this
as being something
investable for me.
And so, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Guys, how many units
do you have in inventory?
About ??
We have about 5,000.
Yep.
Okay, how much
have you invested so far?
$63,000
of our own money.
Wow.
Cuban: I mean, my only
suggestion to you guys is,
take 500 of those units
and get them to people
with long hair.
Find an influencer
that you might know.
And I would give them to all
of your daughter's friends
and just say,
"You know what, guys?
Give us feedback."
Maybe that'll
create some ideas,
because you have to find out
what sells your product,
because you don't know yet.
I wish you the best of luck,
but it's not a fit for me,
so I'm out.
Patty: This is
absolutely not the end
for HairyGrabster.
We're going to go ahead
with our plans
to launch further online,
and we're gonna
keep moving forward.
The product sucks.
Are you kidding?
I would have to agree
that the product sucks ??
no doubt ??
but what's wrong with ??
You really think
the product sucks?
Yes, but what is wrong
with what you do
is you say,
"It howls at the moon."
That breaks their spirit.
Why would you
have to end ??
No, it doesn't!
It gives them
the information they need!
Yes.
They have to be ready.
Oh, come on.
