Hey there, Sharks.
My name is Oliver Zak,
and I'm from
Cleveland, Ohio.
And I'm Selom Agbitor
from Accra, Ghana.
Today, we are seeking
$500,000
in exchange for 5%
of our tattoo
aftercare company.
[ Sharks groan ]
What the French toast?!
A work of art
is meant to be treasured
for years and years.
Even Picasso and DaVinci
have had their
paintings restored
to their vibrant beginnings
from years ago.
So, why not give
that same love and care
to the art on your body?
That's right ?? we're talking
about your tattoos.
Cuban: [ Chuckles ]
Being permanent exhibitions
on our bodies,
tattoos require constant
maintenance and upkeep
to continue
looking healthy.
With that in mind,
Mad Rabbit was formulated
with seven
all?natural ingredients
that keep tattoos
looking vibrant
and prevent
ink discoloration.
As you can see,
the skin immediately
responds to application,
restoring their ink back to the
vibrant works of art
they were meant to be.
Customers of all
skin tones and types
already swear by Mad Rabbit
as being their go?to product
to keep their old tattoos
looking as good as new.
People have invested
thousands of dollars
and time
into their tattoos.
Mad Rabbit is here to
help them last a lifetime.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to ink a deal?
Greiner: Hah.
So, I have a question.
You said that when you put this
on your tattoo,
it actually makes
the colors more vibrant.
What helps
make it brighter?
The fact that you're
giving it deep moisture...
Exactly.
...so therefore, it doesn't
look dry and dull?
Absolutely.
What about a tattoo
that's already
started to fade?
It helps bring it
back to life.
O'Leary: Why would it
bring it back?
Because the ink
is subdermal, is it not?
Right, so it's not actually
affecting the ink itself.
It's moisturizing the layer
of skin on top of it
which helps it ??
It's just to make it
appear that way,
so you have to keep on
reapplying to keep it ??
Exactly, but the more
you moisturize your tattoo,
the less it fades
over time.
John: Let's go through
your backstory,
and then let's get to the part
where you stole my high school
graduation picture
off the Internet.
[ Laughter ]
And then we can move forward.
All right, so,
I'll begin.
Today's actually
my 24th birthday.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
So, I was born
in Ghana, West Africa.
Like every
immigrant family,
my parents wanted me
to become a doctor,
lawyer, engineer,
or something in finance,
but I always wanted
to be an artist.
But then, I knew that
once I got to college,
I'd have student loans
and have to pay back
my college debt,
so I enrolled in university
as a finance major.
And then, after graduation,
I currently work
in corporate finance
in Dallas, Texas.
Zak: My passion
for entrepreneurship
really started from watching
my father rise from the ashes.
In 2003, he was a surgeon,
got in a car accident,
injured his spine,
and he couldn't operate
because his hand shakes.
You know,
he reinvented himself,
and he is now
an entrepreneur.
So, I knew entrepreneurship
was the thing for me, right?
That's what I wanted
to do long?term.
But where did
the tattoo part come in?
So, that's always been
a passion of ours.
We've always thought
tattoos were so cool.
I obviously don't have
any visible ones.
But, yeah.
[ Laughs ]
Let's talk about
Mad Rabbit.
Let's talk Mad Rabbit.
You basically want $500,000 ??
I'm intrigued ??
for 5%, imputing a $10 million
valuation.
$10 million.
$10 million.
$10 million.
Because you have sales
out the wazoo, right?
Of course, yeah.
We do.
$300,000.
That's it?!
Greiner: What?!
No way.
Last month.
Sharks: Oh!
In the past eight months,
we've done $1.7 million.
Good for you guys.
Good for you.
John: Wow!
Agbitor: We started this
in January ??
In this alone?
Yeah, just one product.
Zak: One product.
That's our
one?product story.
And you started
January when?
January 2019
was when we started,
and that first year,
we did over $400,000.
So we've grown a lot
in the past 18 months.
Who did you sell it to,
and how?
That's remarkable.
Thank you.
Well, we're
direct?to?consumer right now,
so we only sell
on our website.
Good.
But how did you
promote sales there?
That's a tremendous amount
of sales in a short period.
Zak: We've spent a lot
of our marketing money
on content and, actually,
tattoo education.
We put a ton
of time and effort
into researching what
works best for tattoos,
what ingredients
work best,
and getting feedback
from our customers
and then iterating
on our product.
You guys have become
the cool tattoo brand,
basically, right?
We are the cool
tattoo brand.
Yeah. We are.
Yeah, people are using it.
And so, do you have
subscription service?
Exactly. Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
And how many
subscribers do you have?
Over 5,000 subscribers.
There you go.
And what do you charge
per month?
$11.99.
And what does this
cost you?
$2.78.
Is there someone else out there
with these type of ingredients
that is a competitor
of yours, would you say?
Yeah, so, worldwide,
there's about 12 or so
tattoo "aftercare"
competitors.
We are the only
all?natural one
selling in the U. S.
currently.
Are you having
a lot of artists
and people that everybody knows?
Or, you know,
is that the reason?
I'm trying to find the reason,
because there's something
special about what you're doing,
'cause your numbers
clearly say it.
So, for example,
a future NBA Hall?of?Famer
from the Miami Heat
actually reached out to us
asking about the product,
and he's been using it
for the past month now.
So it's organic, right?
It's been organic.
Zak: It's organic.
And you're not paying people
to do these things?
We are paying
some influencers.
Okay, so, tell us about
what you're doing there.
It depends on
the influencer, right?
So, we could have a top?10
tattoo artist in the world
that we say, "Okay,
we need to pay $5,000
so he posts us."
We also have influencers
like these two models
who each have
their own following.
But the cool thing
about tattoos is,
everyone has tattoos
for different reasons.
So each of these influencers
kind of has
their own submarkets,
if that makes sense.
Right, right.
I want to find out your
customer acquisition cost.
It's sitting
between $6 or $7.
?That's not bad.
?That's really good.
Cuban: And so, tell us about
what you're doing
for content creation,
because what we're all
trying to figure out is,
what's the secret sauce?
I think our secret sauce is this
community of tight?knit people
that we've been able to build.
We have thousands
of customer?submitted photos.
Through our Instagram,
we post stories...
There you go.
...of people who ??
We call them
"tattoo tours."
How many followers
on Insta?
90,000.
90,000.
That's it?
And they're all organic.
No, that's not bad.
You guys are the real
"Tattoos of Instagram."
Right.
Okay, content creation.
Right.
How much do you spend
on that monthly?
So, last month,
we spent around
$85,000 in marketing.
So, you did $300,000
last month.
Yes.
How much did you make?
So, last month,
our net's sitting around
20% net profit margins
and around 60 ??
So, you made about
60 grand last month.
And I get that you're
reinvesting it,
but I just wanted to see.
John: But one question ??
And we may have gotten
to this already.
Selom, are you working
on this full?time?
So, sadly, neither of us
are full?time yet.
?Got it. All right.
?That's not sad.
I mean ??
?No, no.
There's no need for you
to be full?time.
Yeah, look what
you're generating
and you're just
moonlighting it.
John: But this is
becoming to my question.
What do you think you're
gonna gross this year?
Off of one product,
we're expecting
to sell $3 million
this year.
How much did you invest in
the business in the beginning?
We started with $300 each,
and we were lucky enough
to be profitable from week one.
[ Laughs ]
Wow. That's
really amazing.
So, guys, let me tell you
what I think about this.
I'm not sure I agree
with your 10 valuation,
but I'm not gonna
fight you about it
because I'm gonna
restructure this in my way.
You don't have to do it.
[ Laughing ]
But the way I look at it ??
?I think I know what's coming.
No, but I'll tell you
what I would do.
I'll give you the $500,000
as a venture debt deal, okay?
I'm gonna charge you 9.75% ??
the average of what I'm doing
venture debt at ??
and I'll take 5% equity,
and I will get behind it
as a educator of tattoos.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you
for the offer, Kevin.
Thank you, Kevin.
I have a lot of respect
for you dudes.
You're not even full?time yet,
and you're killing it.
Thank you.
Corcoran: Hey, guys,
you've really won my respect.
You seem to do everything right.
What I really, really liked
and I think is pure genius is ??
What'd you call them?
"Tattoo tours"?
Right.
Yeah.
I see it as a marketing play.
I'm sitting here thinking,
"What can I do for these guys?"
And honestly, I don't know
what I could do.
So for that reason alone,
I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
All right.
Thank you, Barbara.
John:
Here's my thought.
I'm interested
just 'cause I like you,
but I just think
you're doing it already,
and I don't think that
I could add any value to that,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you, Daymond.
Why are you here?
We want to be the premiere
and the face
of tattoo aftercare.
But why are you here?
What are you looking for?
We want an angel
who's gonna be
behind this vision
and believes in our growth.
Okay, guys,
I'll make you the offer.
I like what you're doing.
I'll give you the 500K,
but I want 12%.
Agbitor:
I think we made a phenomenal
deal with Mark Cuban.
I am honestly really
speechless right now.
I know my parents
are gonna be really happy,
and I'm gonna be
an inspiration
to my friends
back home in Ghana.
Your mom's gonna be
so proud of you, Selom.
