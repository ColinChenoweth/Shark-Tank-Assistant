Powell: Bunch Bikes
is sharing the joy
of family biking
across the country.
What would happen if you
pulled back the curtain?
[ Screams ]
Who wants to milk this deal
for all it's worth?
You have sales
out the wazoo, right?
$600 worth.
?Wow.
?Oh.
That right there is a necessity
for the family.
The problem for me is
it's not your product.
Corcoran: I'll give you
a very greedy offer.
I want 40%.
John: Oh!
This product
howls at the moon.
That breaks their spirit.
I'm gonna give you
$2 million.
?Whoa!
?Oh!
?Wow!
Lori, do you have...?
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
I love this stuff.
Welcome to "Shark Tank."
Hi, my name is Aaron Powell,
and I'm from Denton, Texas.
Yo!
My company is Bunch Bikes,
and I'm seeking
$250,000 for 10% equity.
Biking is a wonderful way
for families with young kids
to enjoy the outdoors together,
but the existing
products on the market
could use a fresh perspective.
Imagine you're 3 years old
and about to go on a bike ride
with your parents.
You are so excited
to get outside,
feel the wind on your face,
and enjoy the scenic views.
[ Laughter ]
What if there was a way to bike
that kept
your precious cargo in view?
It's time to say bye?bye
to the bike trailer
and hello to the Bunch Bike.
The Bunch Bike
is an electric cargo bike
that lets you engage
with your kids while you ride
by putting them up in front.
You can laugh
and talk with them,
point out cool things
along the way,
and make memories together
that will last a lifetime.
And with the Bunch Bike's
spacious front cargo box,
there's enough room
to bring everything you need
for your next family adventure.
Aaron, what does
the bike itself cost?
So, we have two
different bikes here.
This is the one that
we've been selling the longest.
We retail it at $4,295.
Oof.
Wow!
?$4,295?
?$4,295?
$4,295. That's right.
So I can buy the bike
or send my kids to college.
[ Laughter ]
$4,295 sounds like a lot.
This one's actually $6,000.
Of course it is.
And we're going for the premium
quality on the market.
So it's basically got
the top?of?the?line
everything component?wise.
?Wow.
?Oh.
Aaron, why did you invent
the bike?
I did not invent this bike.
Oh.
So let me give you a backstory
about how I kind of
came to this idea.
Please do. Okay.
So I actually used to be, like,
a middle?school band teacher
back in the day, and...
You know, you look like
a middle?school band teacher.
I guess I'll take that
as a compliment.
That's flattering.
That's flattering.
And then everything changed
the day my daughter was born.
And it was like this switch
just, like, flipped in my brain,
like, I don't want
to be a teacher anymore.
And so I call my principal.
I took a 90?day maternity leave,
and I said,
"Okay, I need to take
this 90 days.
I need to find a business that
I can start that will give me
eventually the freedom to,
you know, put my family first."
And so I actually found
an opportunity
in the online jewelry space.
And over the next 18 months,
I put 5 to 6 hours a night,
all my money back into it.
And then I was double my
teaching salary, and so I quit.
To celebrate,
we took a family trip to Sweden.
And that's actually
where I saw a bike like this
for the first time.
And, you know,
initially, I just thought,
"Hey, that's cool.
I want to get one."
I'm into bikes.
I want to ride with my kids.
We come back to the U. S.
There's not really anywhere
to get one from.
And so I thought,
"Hey, here's an opportunity.
Like, this is, like, something
that a lot of people
would be interested in."
And so I sold the last business
for $300,000.
I paid off all my student loans.
I put $85,000 into the Bunch.
And that's kind of
how we got started.
You sold
an online jewelry business
for $300,000?
That's right.
And it was about two and
a half years after I started it.
Did you buy into this business?
Oh, yeah, yeah, gotcha.
Are you a licensee?
So I just wanted to prove
there was even a market here.
So I started small.
I got one sample from a factory
that was already
making bikes like this
for the European market.
And there was a lot of interest,
a lot of sales
right out the gate
just from my Instagram posts.
That's a $6,000 bike, right?
Yes.
What do you buy it for?
So, landed, I can get this bike
for $2,917.
So as an investor, what am
I really investing in?
I'm investing in a good guy ??
Aaron, the bike guy,
but who's really
a distributor, right?
I don't own
any proprietary technology.
Well, it's...
Really good point.
It's their proprietary design.
They've got it registered.
And, like, the exclusive
distribution is for ??
U.S. and Canada, nobody's gonna
be able to get a bike ??
this bike like this here.
Well, the proof of the pudding
is in your sales.
Lifetime sales ??
$2.7 million.
In what period of time?
Very nice.
We started ?? So our first
full year was 2018.
Wow.
Sold $285,000.
Last year,
we did $1.1 million.
This year,
on track for $2.2 million.
?Wow.
?You're killing it.
That's impressive, actually.
Cuban:
You've done a great job.
Don't get me wrong,
right?
You know, $2.2 million
in sales is killing it.
Right? But it's hard for us
to just say, "You know what?
Here's what we're gonna do
to scale your business,
and here's how we can make it
into a ?? you know,
a $50?million business
or whatever it may be."
Well, can I give you
the long?term plan?
My goal, my vision, is,
actually, I want to
make these bikes accessible
to more people,
and so to have my own design
at that point,
where we can roll out
5,000 bikes a year
and reach more people, maybe
under a different brand
or something like that.
That's very laudable, right?
It's great.
But that's a lot
of uncertainty.
So for those reasons,
I'm out, Aaron.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
So, Aaron...
Yes?
...I think
it's a cool product.
The problem for me
is, it's not your product.
It's great
that you are able
to sell it here
in the United States.
Sounds like you're doing
a really good job.
But when I invest,
I want to invest in somebody
who's the owner,
the inventor, the entrepreneur,
where they actually ??
It's "their" product
and their company.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Completely understand.
Thank you.
Aaron, the bikes are
a lot of money.
Yes.
There's nothing wrong
with what you're doing.
I just feel a little
uncomfortable asking people
to pay $5,000
for a bike right now
when a lot of people need just
the little necessities in life.
[ Sighs ]
So it's a tough one.
So I'm a customer,
but I'm out.
Okay. I completely
understand that.
Thank you.
I think you've built
a really good business.
I love going into
high?end verticals.
But you're a distributor.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If I gave you $250,000
and I just took a distribution,
it would be four years
until I got my capital back
and got any kind of return.
So it's a difficult investment
for an investor,
any investor.
So I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
Appreciate it.
Barbara?
Well, I'm lukewarm about it.
I love the product.
The business model,
basically,
I'm subleasing
your distribution sort of.
You control
the distribution,
and you're letting us take
a share of it, no?
Okay,
that's how I see it.
I'll give you
a very greedy offer.
You won't be offended,
right?
You can't offend me.
Oh, yes, she can.
in Aaron's high?end bike
and cart company, Bunch Bikes.
I'll give you
a very greedy offer.
You won't be offended,
right?
You can't offend me.
Oh, yes, she can.
Well, I'll take that back.
Not intentionally.
?Sweat equity.
?But I'll give you the $250,000,
but I want 40%.
?Oh! Barbara!
?Whoo!
He looks offended to me.
I don't know if "offended"
is the right word.
Are you offended?
He didn't say no yet.
Look, I didn't say no yet.
So you're saying
there's a chance.
Look, for based on what
our net's gonna be this year,
I felt like I came in
with a pretty reasonable offer.
I mean, that's cutting
my valuation so much.
There's nothing reasonable
about Barbara.
I'm bringing
a lot to the table here, too.
Getting this started
was not easy.
In our first year, I had
my first manufacturers screw me.
They had had a typhoon come in,
flood out their factory.
My bikes had been underwater,
like, a foot underwater,
and they shipped them
out to us anyways.
