Powell: Bunch Bikes
is sharing the joy
of family biking
across the country.
What would happen if you
pulled back the curtain?
[ Screams ]
Who wants to milk this deal
for all it's worth?
You have sales
out the wazoo, right?
$600 worth.
?Wow.
?Oh.
That right there is a necessity
for the family.
The problem for me is
it's not your product.
Corcoran: I'll give you
a very greedy offer.
I want 40%.
John: Oh!
This product
howls at the moon.
That breaks their spirit.
I'm gonna give you
$2 million.
?Whoa!
?Oh!
?Wow!
Lori, do you have...?
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
I love this stuff.
Welcome to "Shark Tank."
Hi, my name is Aaron Powell,
and I'm from Denton, Texas.
Yo!
Aaron, what does
the bike itself cost?
So, we have two
different bikes here.
This is the one that
we've been selling the longest.
We retail it at $4,295.
Oof.
Wow!
?$4,295?
?$4,295?
$4,295. That's right.
So I can buy the bike
or send my kids to college.
[ Laughter ]
$4,295 sounds like a lot.
This one's actually $6,000.
Of course it is.
Aaron, why did you invent
the bike?
I did not invent this bike.
Oh.
So let me give you a backstory
about how I kind of
came to this idea.
Please do. Okay.
I'm investing in a good guy ??
Aaron, the bike guy,
but who's really
a distributor, right?
I don't own
any proprietary technology.
Well, it's...
Really good point.
It's their proprietary design.
They've got it registered.
So for those reasons,
I'm out, Aaron.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
So, Aaron...
Yes?
...I think
it's a cool product.
The problem for me
is, it's not your product.
It's great
that you are able
to sell it here
in the United States.
Sounds like you're doing
a really good job.
But when I invest,
I want to invest in somebody
who's the owner,
the inventor, the entrepreneur,
where they actually ??
It's "their" product
Aaron, the bikes are
a lot of money.
Yes.
There's nothing wrong
with what you're doing.
I just feel a little
uncomfortable asking people
to pay $5,000
for a bike right now
when a lot of people need just
the little necessities in life.
[ Sighs ]
So it's a tough one.
So I'm a customer,
but I'm out.
in Aaron's high?end bike
and cart company, Bunch Bikes.
I'll give you
a very greedy offer.
You won't be offended,
right?
You can't offend me.
Oh, yes, she can.
Well, I'll take that back.
Not intentionally.
?Sweat equity.
?But I'll give you the $250,000,
but I want 40%.
?Oh! Barbara!
?Whoo!
He looks offended to me.
I don't know if "offended"
is the right word.
Are you offended?
He didn't say no yet.
Look, I didn't say no yet.
So you're saying
there's a chance.
Look, for based on what
our net's gonna be this year,
I felt like I came in
with a pretty reasonable offer.
I mean, that's cutting
my valuation so much.
There's nothing reasonable
about Barbara.
I'm bringing
a lot to the table here, too.
Getting this started
was not easy.
In our first year, I had
my first manufacturers screw me.
They had had a typhoon come in,
flood out their factory.
My bikes had been underwater,
like, a foot underwater,
