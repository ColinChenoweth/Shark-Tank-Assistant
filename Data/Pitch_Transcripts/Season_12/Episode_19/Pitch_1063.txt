Hello, Sharks.
My name is Mike Sewell.
I'm from Springfield, Missouri,
?It's pretty clever.
?Mike, it's a great innovation.
Is there not other products
that do the exact, same thing?
There are products
that are similar, yes.
We do have that patented,
though.
What's the patent?
What's different about
your product?
?The teeth?
?About ?? Yes, it has the teeth.
Sewell:
It has ?? just the design.
Herjavec:
Mike, you're killing it.
I think you'll continue,
but more at
the $300,000 level.
I think you've
hit a peak.
I don't want to buy in
at the peak.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
I don't know how to value this
'cause of the peak COVID.
I think I can
add a lot of value maybe
in cutting
customer?acquisition costs.
I don't know. I'm gonna do
the $300,000 for 10%.
I have a?a level of interest.
Have you ever gone to IDA?
?To where?
?Ah?ha!

International
Door Association.
There's an
International Door Association?
There is something
for everything.
I have not.
So, I think that
I could take it there.
But I also have
a?a fully automated factory
in New York
that I'm a partner in.
So I can reduce your cost,
probably,
Mike, Mike ?? I have ??
You got three offers.
What do you want to do?
Let me just finish.
I want to ??
I mean, I want to ??
You're being so rude.
You're saying the same thing.
Lori, we got your infomercial.
Your infomercial's done.
I'm just gonna keep going
just to make him crazy.
Oh, my gosh.
When you do that,
there's tons of people out there
that have businesses
that aren't gonna be
in that distribution channel
that you are already in.
I think I've heard enough.
So, I'm gonna give you
$300,000 for 8%.
Ooh, going down.
Ooh, I like that.
Um, Daymond,
can you do 6%?
I just went
from 12% to 8%.
Stick to your guns, Mike.
Stick to your guns.
Mike, down to two offers.
Yeah.
Cuban: Stick to
your guns, Mike.
You got a ?? You got
a lot of margin there...
You don't need him, Mike.
Mike, Daymond's
$300,000 for 8%.
You made
the right decision, Mike.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Mike, you've built a great
business. Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
I think you made
a really bad mistake,
but I wish you
all the best.
Good luck,
Mike.
?Thank you.
?Yes!
Sewell: A lot of businesses are
not making it through this time,
