Hello, Sharks.
My name is Mike Sewell.
I'm from Springfield, Missouri,
and I'm here today on behalf
of my two business partners.
We are seeking $300,000
for a 3% stake in our company...
Ooh!
...StepNpull.
Whoa!
?Whoa!
?Wow!
Tired of grabbing
germy door handles?
Well, we've got the solution
that will let you <i>step</i>
right past them.
Sharks, I'm sure you've been
in a public restroom...
[ Pants zip ]
...washing your hands,
when the person next to you
has questionable hygiene habits.
[ Laughter ]
Take a look at this guy.
Greiner: Oh!
?It's pretty clever.
?Mike, it's a great innovation.
Is there not other products
that do the exact, same thing?
There are products
that are similar, yes.
We do have that patented,
though.
What's the patent?
What's different about
your product?
?The teeth?
?About ?? Yes, it has the teeth.
Sewell:
It has ?? just the design.
You step down
and pull the door open.
It's a low cost to manufacture
because of the design.
So tell us
about your business.
Yeah, so, this is
our 13th year in business.
Me and my two partners,
we had full?time jobs,
and it was
a sideline business.
And the first five years
were fairly flat with sales.
We maybe sold $35,000.
And then, this year,
we've had a nice bump in sales.
I would imagine.
And we sold more in March
than we sold the whole time
we've been in business.
What'd you sell in March?
About a million seven.
What?!
?Yeah.
?Million seven?
?You guys are killin' it, then.
?$1 million?
?Wow.
?Of course.
Our year?to?date right now is,
we're approaching
$7 million in sales.
What?!
You what?
Wow.
How much do you sell these
to ?? to wholesalers,
and what's it cost you
to make?
Well, retail is $29.95.
Our U. S. cost to manufacture
is between $8 and $9...
Uh?huh.
...although we've just worked
with one of our manufacturers
in southwest Missouri and got
the price down to under $7.
Yeah, 'cause he's thrilled
to death, too, right...
Oh, yeah.
...'cause he's crushing it.
That was one of the best things
about it,
was the people we employed
during all this ??
So ?? So what percentage
of your business
is online
versus wholesale?
About 25% distributors
and 75% direct.
Damn!
Yeah, 75%.
You are killing it!
Yeah.
Yeah, our website sales
are the highest sales channel
with about over 30 ??
probably 35% of our sales.
Herjavec:
Mike, you're killing it.
I think you'll continue,
but more at
the $300,000 level.
I think you've
hit a peak.
I don't want to buy in
at the peak.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
I don't know how to value this
'cause of the peak COVID.
I think I can
add a lot of value maybe
in cutting
customer?acquisition costs.
I don't know. I'm gonna do
the $300,000 for 10%.
I have a?a level of interest.
Have you ever gone to IDA?
?To where?
?Ah?ha!
[ Laughter ]
International
Door Association.
There's an
International Door Association?
There is something
for everything.
I have not.
So, I think that
I could take it there.
But I also have
a?a fully automated factory
in New York
that I'm a partner in.
So I can reduce your cost,
probably,
and I can also
increase your sales.
Mike, Mike ?? I have ??
You got three offers.
What do you want to do?
Let me just finish.
I want to ??
I mean, I want to ??
You're being so rude.
You're saying the same thing.
Lori, we got your infomercial.
Your infomercial's done.
I'm just gonna keep going
just to make him crazy.
Oh, my gosh.
When you do that,
there's tons of people out there
that have businesses
that aren't gonna be
in that distribution channel
that you are already in.
I think I've heard enough.
So, I'm gonna give you
$300,000 for 8%.
Ooh, going down.
Ooh, I like that.
Um, Daymond,
can you do 6%?
I just went
from 12% to 8%.
Stick to your guns, Mike.
Stick to your guns.
And I'll help clear the air.
I'm gonna go out.
Mike, down to two offers.
Yeah.
Cuban: Stick to
your guns, Mike.
You got a ?? You got
a lot of margin there...
You don't need him, Mike.
...and I can bring down
those prices.
Beyond
the manufacturing help,
what's your vision for ??
Well, I?I told you about a trade
show you didn't even know about.
Right.
Well, that's true, yeah.
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary: I'll put more pressure
on if you want.
I'll do it at 6%.
Mike, Daymond's
$300,000 for 8%.
You made
the right decision, Mike.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Mike, you've built a great
business. Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
?Congratulations.
I think you made
a really bad mistake,
but I wish you
all the best.
Alright, thank you.
And congratulations
on your success.
Good luck,
Mike.
?Thank you.
?Yes!
Sewell: A lot of businesses are
not making it through this time,
and we've been blessed
to have an opportunity
that does help businesses
open back up.
It helps keep their employees
and customers safe.
And for us to be in this
position is very humbling.
And we're ?? we're so grateful
that, you know,
we have the opportunity.
