Mike, I mean, I always talk
about the American Dream.
You're living
the Inventor's Dream.
You know,
the most valuable asset
we can never own
is our time.
And you have an opportunity here
to make a choice ??
take an investment
and hope you can just
take this back up
to millions of dollars a month,
or you can grow it
the way you always have
and it's worked for you,
and enjoy your time.
Not every business has to grow
to maximize sales,
because, again, the one asset
that's more valuable
than any dollar
you will ever earn
is your time and your ability
to enjoy that time.
So I'm out, but I'm telling you,
you don't need an offer.
Alright, thank you.
Hi, Sharks, I'm Rebecca.
And I'm her husband, Eric.
We're from Arizona,
seeking $150,000
for 15% equity in...
DynoSafe!
DynoSafe!
People are ordering home
delivery for everything now ??
clothing, electronics,
and, more importantly,
food, medication,
and other perishable items.
Yeah, the are.
Line, please.
[ Laughter ]
Line, please!
?Thank you very much.
?You can start over.
Yeah, feel free to
start over.
People are ordering home
delivery for everything now ??
clothing, electronics,
and, more importantly,
medicine and food...
Eric: [ Whispering ]
"Other essential."
...and other
essential items.
[ Laughs ] Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry.
You know, we all need
essential items, so...
?You can start over.
?Essential, perishable items.
?Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Okay.
?Yeah, take a breath.
?Tell me the line.
?"Other essential items."
"Other essential
perishable items."
And other essential
perishable items.
[ Mumbles ]
Okay.
And other essential
perishable items.
But how do we keep them safe,
secure, and fresh
until someone
can get them?
Introducing...
DynoSafe!
DynoSafe...
...the patented smart?home
temperature?controlled safe
that secures to the porch
and is essential
for contactless deliveries.
Here's how DynoSafe works.
Customers place an order
and assign a temperature to it
on our easy?to?use app.
And because it is
climate?controlled,
it protects perishable items
like groceries,
takeout food,
and medication...
from the elements,
keeping them safe, secure,
and protected.
Whenever a simple, one?click,
contactless delivery is made...
The DynoSafe app sends an alert
to the customer
that their delivery
has arrived
and they have sa?? p??
they have...
?Yay!
?Rebecca, you did it!
How did you
come up with this?
I came up with this idea
because I owned a business
in the Dallas area,
and it was very successful.
Yeah!
What business?
It's a medi?spa.
I came up with the idea
because as a business owner,
I had a patient
that asked me
to send them some things,
and I did,
and she claimed
she never received them.
So, we all dread
that phone call.
So, you pull another one
off your shelf
and you send that one
to them, too.
And it's really
eating into our profit.
And where are you now
at the stage of the business?
I started out with
a lot of research,
and I ?? I got the patent
completely issued.
And so we've tested it
in Scottsdale and in Seattle.
?I mean, how many homes?
?How many physical homes?
Oh, okay, three.
Now, how did you engage
with the large online retailers?
There's one really,
really big one...
[ Laughs ]
...that everybody
orders from.
What happens with them?
We have had lots of
conversations
with those big people
and also grocery.
So, during this process,
what I learned was
grocery is the most desperate
to roll this out.
And I learned this
before coronavirus.
Coronavirus has just catapulted
everything forward
about three years.
Right.
After you tested
in only three homes...
Right.
...did you actually sell any?
No. So, this is a prototype.
That's all we have.
Our business model
is to license this out.
Our conversations with grocery
has revealed
that they desperately want
to roll this out
as part of
a subscription model.
Are you licensed to
any of them?
You're not selling this
to the consumer.
I'm in conversations
with someone ??
a?a great big?box retail
in the United States.
Let me tell you
the thing that's
the ?? the most
special about this.
My patent protects
having the ability
to do one?click unlock
and adjust the temperature
inside, the thermostat.
So you want to have
a subscription for it.
And I'm guessing it sends
a unique code.
The software sends
a unique code...
Right.
...to whoever's doing
the delivery.
That's right.
That's ??
So there's not one code that
everybody uses all the time.
That's right.
I go to the DynoSafe app
and say, "Hey, yeah,
I'm gonna order
some groceries."
A random code ??
one?time?use random code,
and I assign
a temperature to that.
So if I know I have
frozen items,
or if it's just produce,
I'll set that temperature,
and I'm done.
Here's my problem.
Okay.
If I went and talked to
my relationship guy at Amazon
and say, "Look,
theft is a huge problem.
What are you guys
doing about it?"
Now, am I to assume that
they're not working on that?
Yeah.
That <i>Rebecca</i> is
working on it?
Well, I've actually spoken
with them
and Walmart
and grocery executives.
And everybody's saying,
"We can't do it.
Only Rebecca can do it."
I?I own the patent.
Yes.
And they cannot add
the temperature control
and smart together.
The combination is
really smart, right...
Yeah.
...because the temperature
control really is the key,
right, because there's
a dozen different ways
to do a smart unlock.
Yours having to do a code
is going be outdated
very quickly, right,
because it'll just be an app
that you walk up,
it says, "Oh, I recognize my app
via Bluetooth, RF,
whatever it may be."
Eric: Right.
And it sends a code to that app
that allows it to be unlocked.
And so because you have so far
to go in terms of catching up
with state?of?the?art,
in terms of walk?up unlocking,
that's a real challenge,
and it's going to be very
difficult for you to keep up.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. I am devastated to
hear that, honestly.
Why would a retailer take
such a big investment risk
to then lease it
to a customer
who may not be
a lifelong customer?
I just think it's gonna be
really challenging
to get the retailer
to take this in
and then issue it back out,
so I'm out.
And ?? And I just ??
I need to go back.
I think I was kind of,
you know ??
obviously, I was
incredibly nervous.
Rebecca, I think
we understand ??
No, no, no.
Let me ask you a question,
'cause I can see...
Yes.
...you're so passionate
about this...
Yeah, Lori.
...and I understand,
you know.
And I, obviously ??
I know you're nervous
being here today.
Tell me, how much of your own
money did you put into this?
We're about $500,000 in.
?Whoa!
?$500,000?
?Whoa!
?And that's your own?
We're all in.
We're definitely all in, Lori.
No, there's ?? there's
no joke.
Yeah.
I think what you did
is so smart.
I love that
you have a patent.
But what I don't love is,
is that I'm still a little
confused about all of this.
I just can't think of,
what are gonna be all the steps
that I'm going to do
to help you?
So, unfortunately,
for these reasons, I'm out.
Rebecca,
is the $500,000 gone,
and what did
you spend it on?
So, it's on IP,
and it's also
on the engineering
and trade shows
and securing relationships.
I have a distributor
who has a current relationship
with a large?box retailer
who they ?? they ?? they
already provide to them,
they distribute to them
the locker systems ??
the temperature?controlled
locker systems.
But, Rebecca,
it doesn't work that way.
If the distributor was truly
interested and you said to them,
"Look, I have this IP,
I have this patent,
but I don't have the money
to make the box,"
they would do it.
With all due respect,
you're not a software company.
To Mark's earlier point,
the ?? the way you're
describing the software
and the locking working,
it's, like, 20 years ago.
I can tell you
about technology
that can secure a device
like that
just by somebody
walking up to it.
There's better ways
to do it.
But if the patent holds true
for the old way,
it would also hold true
for the new way.
Yes.
Robert, where are you
gonna do?
[ Sighs ]
Ye??
My new?world ways of doing this,
securing stuff,
makes me very interested
<i>if</i> the patent holds.
But I don't want to own
15% of it.
I want to own 51% of it.
Oy.
but Robert is interested in
Eric and Rebecca's
temperature?controlled
smart locker, DynoSafe.
But he wants a much bigger stake
in the company
than the 15% for $150,000
they came in offering.
I don't want to own
15% of it.
I want to own 51% of it.
Oy.
O'Leary: Let me take a different
stab at it, okay?
I also don't know
if your patent has merit.
I just don't.
But I'm gonna do the $150,000.
But I don't want control.
I'd like to get 40%,
'cause either this is binary...
Oh!
...it's either gonna work
or it isn't.
We're going to go
and license the technology.
That's my offer.
You have two offers.
You have to pick one.
What do you want to do?
Well...
Rebecca:
I'm super excited.
You know, at the end of the day,
I have two people
who are incredible
in the tech industry
and Robert, especially,
with security.
And, you know, I think
it's ?? it's amazing,
and it's just gonna
propel us forward faster.
Creative, Rob.
I like it.
No, hey, Robert, it's either
Ring or it's nothing.
Yeah.
That's exactly
what I was thinking.
I?I don't want to make
that mistake.
If the patent holds up,
which it sounds like it is,
'cause it could be huge.
This is a big problem.
If the patent ?? If the
patent holds up for what
it suggests it can be...
It has big potential, yes.
...then it can be done.
