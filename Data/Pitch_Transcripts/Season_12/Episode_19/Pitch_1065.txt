Maxfield: Who wants
the soon?to?be?most?successful
"Shark Tank" product ever?
Ugh!
Tired of grabbing
germy door handles?
Which of you is ready
to <i>fix</i> this door?handle dilemma?
The retailer that
rolls this out first
is going to own
the front porch.
What are your sales?
$7 million in sales.
What?!
You're living
the inventor's dream.
I want to own 51%.
?I think that's a garbage offer.
?Screw you.
I've got to go
live with myself
when I walk out of here.
Walk away.
That's how you do a deal.
I'm Merrick Maxfield
from South Jordan, Utah.
For only 150K, you can own 7%
of a new technology
for something we all need.
Did you know humans can't live
without probiotics?
Probiotics are microorganisms
that live in our bodies
and help us in hundreds of ways,
including boosting
your immune system,
fighting diseases,
even improves sleep.
You can get probiotics
from healthy foods like yogurt
or even from pills.
But pills are super expensive.
Now, we have eight kids,
so I bought four cases
of yogurt.
Guess how long
those 32 yogurts lasted?
[ Laughing ]
Not even two days.
So we bought four yogurt makers,
but it took forever
and would fill the sink
with dishes.
So, Sharks,
that's when I decided
to stop the madness
and went to work.
[ Laughter ]
After 27 generations
of prototypes,
we ended up with the perfect,
inspired solution.
Introducing the Probiotic Maker.
Cuban: Whoa!
[ Greiner chuckles ]
So, simply add a starter packet
with 11 types of probiotic seeds
to a bottle of milk
or milk alternative.
Merrick, all you're doing
is you're heating ??
This is just really
a heat pad?
Yes. It does it all
magically overnight.
It's all automatic.
And this targets
body temperature.
I had the inspiration ??
If you want probiotics to thrive
at body temperature,
then why not grow it
in the body temperature?
Why has no one
thought of this before?
What are your strains
of probiotic in here?
So, this, um...
Yeah, the lactose ??
the most common, uh...
lactobacillus, "bifidobim,"
and, uh, "rhasmosus,"
"acidmophilus," so...
Listen,
I gotta tell you ??
When you sell something
that people ingest,
it is really important
to know
and have
on your packaging...
Yep.
...because every probiotic
will tell you,
what are the exact
probiotics in it...
The exact probiotics.
Well ??
...the names of them.
Herjavec: Merrick,
I may not know
the names
of all the strains...
Oh, yeah.
...but I do know the name of,
what are your sales?
[ Laughs ]
Okay, so in 2018,
our sales were
about $22,000.
How much?
?$22,000.
?$22,000.
$22,000.
And then
last year's sales
increased by, like,
almost 350%...
To what?
...to about $76,000.
And then ??
How are you worth
$2.5 million?
Hold on.
And then?
We went to the ?? the
International Housewares Show.
There, we were told that we
needed to get UL certification.
Got it.
And so we lost
most of last year
working through
the UL certification process.
And your sales
this year?
And our sales this year ??
like $18,000.
What?
Because ??
Oh, wow!
So, what it is ??
Okay, let's talk about
anger management.
I have been working
very hard this year,
as you may know,
on anger management.
You came in here...
Greiner: [ Laughing ]
He's failed today.
...at $2.5 million valuation
with $18,000 in sales.
Do you see anything wrong
with that at all?
That is ?? during the COVID,
there's been $18,000.
Lifetime sales is
about $150,000.
I get it, but the trajectory
of sales is this.
This is not good.
<i>This</i> is good.
Not good. Good.
Yeah.
Merrick, what does
one of these cost?
?Yeah.
?Okay.
The Probiotic Maker sells
for $99.95 MSRP.
$99 for this?
Yeah.
Right now, it's just under
$20 to make them.
John:
I think it's ?? it's ??
With me, I think that
you have a huge market
because I'm a ??
I'm a ?? you know,
someone who takes the stuff.
But I don't know
enough about science.
I'll be very honest.
I don't know.
And Lori and some
of the other Sharks
really know, like, FDA approval
and stuff like that.
So I just don't know
if it's worth the risk for me.
So I'm out.
Okay, sorry to hear that.
I do think that this is
really interesting,
because I'm a probiotic taker,
believer.
They tasted great.
The only problem for me is I
just don't see anything on this
that gives me all the already
tried?and?true safety testing
and things
that I would want to see
to say,
"Okay, now I feel safe."
Herjavec: Is that
your only problem?
This is all...
It truly is
my only problem.
...FDA?certified.
You're not there yet
for me
to feel comfortable with it
as an investor...
So, we can put whatever...
...regardless of
the valuation.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
...whatever you would like.
Alright,
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry.
O'Leary: Why in the world
would you want to
waste your time with this?
The mountain you have to climb
to tell consumers
how to use this thing,
convince them to try it,
even educate people around
the benefits of probiotics ??
that's crazy.
Like, why would you
even attempt to do that?
I don't even want to talk about
the $2.5 million valuation.
You know that was a mistake.
This is a horrific idea
and, in some ways, evil.
That bad. That bad.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Oh, come on.
?Alright.
?I think there's evil.
Merrick, look, I don't see
the $2.5 million valuation.
I'm out.
The concept is
really good, right?
You just aren't
quite there yet.
I mean,
as smart as you are, right ??
I am having people
from a hospital of ??
a liver doctor called me,
a gastroenterologist.
Merrick, Merrick,
hold on, hold on.
What I'm gonna tell you is,
functionality?wise,
I understand completely,
and everything you're saying
rings true
and makes perfect sense,
right?
But the hard part
is the marketing side, right?
Yes.
Because you're having
challenges here.
There's just
too many things
that I'm uncertain about
from the marketing side.
We could ??
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
We could do a contingency
on whatever ??
You're just early.
If you didn't come in here
saying this was worth
$2.5 million,
you would have
gotten a deal.
I just had no idea.
I know why you said
$2.5 million.
You got eight kids.
So make me an offer.
I'm sorry, Merrick.
You're not quite there yet.
Alright,
so everybody's out?
?Everyone's out.
?Yes. Good luck.
?Good luck, Merrick.
?Good luck.
Thank you.
Greiner: Good luck, Merrick.
It tasted good.
Oh.
I?I just can't fathom why
they wouldn't want
to take a chance
on this tremendous opportunity.
It's the lowest?cost probiotics,
the most convenient,
the best tasting,
and you can save the planet
at the same time.
What ?? What more do they want?
What more do the Sharks want?
He was doing
$18,000 in sales.
Oh!
He said the company was
worth $2.5 million.
I really do think that he has
a good idea here, but ??
