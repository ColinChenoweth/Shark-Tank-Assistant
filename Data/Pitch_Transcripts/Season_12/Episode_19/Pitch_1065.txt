Maxfield: Who wants
the soon?to?be?most?successful
"Shark Tank" product ever?
Ugh!
I'm Merrick Maxfield
from South Jordan, Utah.
For only 150K, you can own 7%
of a new technology
for something we all need.
Did you know humans can't live
without probiotics?
Probiotics are microorganisms
that live in our bodies
Merrick, all you're doing
is you're heating ??
This is just really
a heat pad?
Yes. It does it all
magically overnight.
It's all automatic.
...the names of them.
Herjavec: Merrick,
I may not know
the names
of all the strains...
Oh, yeah.

Okay, so in 2018,
our sales were
about $22,000.
How much?
?$22,000.
?$22,000.
$22,000.
Merrick, what does
one of these cost?
?Yeah.
?Okay.

Right now, it's just under
$20 to make them.
John:

With me, I think that
you have a huge market
because I'm a ??
I'm a ?? you know,
someone who takes the stuff.
But I don't know
enough about science.
I'll be very honest.
I don't know.
Merrick, look, I don't see
the $2.5 million valuation.
I'm out.
The concept is
really good, right?
You just aren't
quite there yet.
I mean,
as smart as you are, right ??
I am having people
from a hospital of ??
a liver doctor called me,
a gastroenterologist.
Merrick, Merrick,
hold on, hold on.
What I'm gonna tell you is,
functionality?wise,
I'm sorry, Merrick.
You're not quite there yet.
Alright,
so everybody's out?
?Everyone's out.
?Yes. Good luck.
?Good luck, Merrick.
?Good luck.
Thank you.
Greiner: Good luck, Merrick.
It tasted good.
Oh.
I?I just can't fathom why
they wouldn't want
to take a chance
on this tremendous opportunity.
It's the lowest?cost probiotics,
the most convenient,
the best tasting,
