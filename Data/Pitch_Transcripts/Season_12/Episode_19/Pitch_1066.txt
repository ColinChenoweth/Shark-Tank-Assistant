Conway: PHOOZY is the world's
first thermal capsule.
It's like a space suit
for your phone.
You guys are my heroes.
?Oh, Kevin!
?Oh, my gosh.
Let's see if he washes
his hands after ?? Ugh! ??
all of that.
?[ Laughing ] Oh, gross.
?Ew.
Disgusting.
Kevin wants 10%.
He brings nothing to it.
I'm gonna do it for 12%.
I don't agree with that.
$300,000 for 12%.
So, I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna do.
I see you have, like,
a commercial end,
and I see there's
a consumer end to this...
Mm?hmm.
...because ??
Why would people put this
in their homes, Lori?
No, I think people
<i>will</i> put this a lot of places.
I want to make you an offer,
and my plan would be to do
an infomercial with this.
I would do $300,000
for 5% equity.
I would want
50 cents back a unit.
And then once I've hit
$500,000,
then the royalty will drop
to 20 cents per.
I think
that's a garbage offer.
Yeah, I ??
But I can help you
to blow this up
and get this into
every retailer, get it...
We all can do that.
We all can do that.
...onto television,
get it digital.
I don't believe that.
Lori ?? Lori,
I appreciate the offer.
I?I struggle with
the infomercial because
it isn't a consumer product.
It isn't.
No, but it can <i>be</i>
a consumer product.
To get that ROI...
It's never gonna be that.
...outside of commercial,
I?I don't know that
we would get that
because
businesses will buy.
Yes.
People in a home
will not.
No, no, I totally get that,
but what I'm saying to you is,
if we do it effectively,
right, so...
O'Leary:
Not a consumer product.
Lori ?? Lori,
is your pitch over?
Greiner: ...I think
what happens is when ??
Mike, what are you gonna do?
Now we're just begging, Kevin.
No, no, I'm just ?? Look, you're
not gonna get what you want
'cause I'm gonna keep
squeezing.
Walk away. Walk away.
Kevin's $300,000.
He's at 6%.
Yeah, he's at 6%.
What are you gonna do?
Kevin, let's do it.
Yes!
Cuban: What are you
gonna do, Kevin?
Oh.
Oh, I'm out.
?Kevin, plug it in.
?Lori, Lori, Lori, Lori.
[ Laughs ]
I'm gonna go plug my head in,
okay?
?Please do.
?That was the worst.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Kevin Conway,
and I'm from Charlotte,
North Carolina.
And I'm Josh Inglis
from Atlanta, Georgia.
We're here seeking
$500,000
for 10% of our company,
PHOOZY.
Now, that may sound
expensive,
but you know
what's really expensive?
Our phones, our laptops,
and our tablets,
especially when you have to
replace them because of damage.
Just leaving your phone
out in the sun
can cause
permanent battery damage.
Drop it in the lake?
It's sunk.
And I could've taken a selfie
on that double black diamond
if my phone hadn't died.
Sure, dude.
"Double black diamond."
No, I swear.
My phone died
from the cold.
Anyway, that's why
we invented PHOOZY.
PHOOZY is the world's
first thermal capsule
to protect
your expensive devices
from overheating
in the sun,
extend battery life in the cold,
float in water,
and provide military?grade
drop protection.
Did we mention that it's made
from space?suit technology?
It's like a space suit
for your phone, literally.
But don't just
take our word for it.
Sharks,
we want you to put
our patented technology
to the test.
Daymond, can we invite you up
to the climate?testing lab?
?Yeah.
?Okay.
Get in the suit, Daymond.
Get in the suit.
?Let's go.
?Send him to outer space.
We have a lab coat for you,
along with safety glasses.
Sharks, we'll be using
this thermal?imaging camera
so that you can see
the hot and cold temperatures
through each
of the simulations.
[ Light laughter ]
So, what we've done is we've
placed an unprotected device
and a phone inside of
the PHOOZY thermal capsule
for each
of your simulations.
The first one is gonna be
the extreme heat
of the solar simulation.
So go ahead and touch the
unprotected device right there.
It's pretty hot.
John:
Yeah, it's really hot.
I don't even know if
this phone probably would work.
Now pick this up?
?Sure.
?Pick up the PHOOZY.
Uh?huh.
And then you can open it up
with those tabs on top
and remove the device,
and you can feel
the temperature difference.
Wow. It's almost ??
it's almost cool.
You guys can actually see
right there.
That is the phone that was
inside of the PHOOZY,
and then that phone...
Yeah, and this bag
is not hot.
...right there is
well over 100 degrees.
?This protector is not hot.
?Not hot at all.
?Okay.
?Correct.
So, now your next mission is
going to be to experience
the freeze
of the Arctic simulation.
Okay.
You can carefully touch
that unprotected device
because that is
negative?50?degree dry ice.
Whoa!
Be careful there.
It's very, very cold.
But you can see
the temperature there.
Now go ahead and pick up
the PHOOZY, and same thing.
Remove the device.
Let's check the temperature
of that device.
This is cold, though.
Yep, you can see
the difference there ??
about 65 degrees
of that device...
Uh?huh.
...but it's still
gonna work...
Okay.
...where the other device
is gonna be
completely frozen
and dead.
You see
the temperature there ??
it's going greater
than negative 40.
Okay.
?Wow.
?Be careful.
So, Daymond,
your final simulation
is gonna be what we call
our "Ohhh No!" simulation.
Okay.
So that PHOOZY there
has a phone inside the blue one.
Go ahead and drop it in.
?Drop the whole one in?
?Yes, sir.
Drop the whole thing in.
As you can see,
our sink?proof technology
keeps your device
at the surface of the water
so you can quickly
retrieve it.
Okay, I got it.
?Yeah.
?Very cool.
So, thank you, Daymond.
Good job, Daymond.
Good job, Daymond.
Thank you.
It was nothing.
Tell us about you guys.
So, for the past
25 years,
I've been a professional
race car driver,
having raced at
the highest levels
Inglis:
And prior to PHOOZY,
I spent over 15 years
as an executive
at one of the largest
home?improvement retailers,
helping grow online revenue
from $100 million
to over $5 billion
in 2017.
?Wow.
?Wow. How did you guys ??
How did you get together
to start the company?
We've been great friends
for over 20 years.
We're always talking about
business ideas.
But finally, in 2016, Kevin came
to me with this great idea,
and, honestly, I was ready
for a ?? ready for change.
I know this space
from a bunch of products
over the years
on "Shark Tank,"
and there are many, many, many,
many case companies...
Sure.
...and are you telling me
there isn't one other
that gives me protection
against heat and cold
and drop protection?
I'm having a real hard time
believing that.
Sure. There is not.
In fact, we have
an issued utility patent
around
our thermal technology
and also the drop and the float
components of our product.
Is there even a demand
for this?
In the 36 months
since launch,
we've done $1.9 million
in sales.
?Hello!
?Okay.
We did $700,000
in sales last year.
This year, we'll be
at $1.5 million.
We're projected to be
at $4.5 million next year.
Is this through retail?
It's almost all
direct?to?consumer.
Now, that's great.
That's impressive.
That's very impressive.
What will you
make on that?
25%.
Why does one cost?
Our blended gross margin
is 88%.
Cuban:
That's your gross margin?
?Yes.
?Yes.
Damn!
Landed cost is anywhere
from $3 to $15.
Retail is anywhere
from $30 to $70.
This one that's silver that has
an iPhone in it ??
Is this the lowest...?
It is.
That's the entry point.
That is our entry point.
That is just under $3,
and that sells for $29.99.
The black one ??
that cost is about $3.85.
That product retails
for $34.99.
The silver one there
is just under $5,
and that retails for $50.
You guys are my heroes.
Oh, my God.
Herjavec: Have you raised
a lot of money,
and how much money
have you put in?
Sure. So, we have not
raised any money.
We have bootstrapped
this entire thing.
Josh and I have put in
$85,000.
We've been profitable
every quarter since launch.
[ Clapping ]
?Wow.
?Wow.
And we've just
slugged it out.
I was not expecting
that answer.
You guys, look,
the product's phenomenal.
Your accomplishments
are phenomenal.
I'm not the rugged
outdoors type, you know?
It's just not my scene, so
it would be really hard for me
to support you
promotionally.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
But congratulations.
What you've been able
to accomplish so quickly
is phenomenal.
?Thank you. Thank you.
?Thank you.
So what do you need
my $500,000 for?
So, the biggest thing for us
is scaling our team
to add a few key positions,
because it's just Josh and I.
It's really hard for us
to keep up
and ?? and to support
that growth.
If I give you $500,000
and I participate
in 10% distributions,
it's gonna take me 10 years
to get my money back?
Or how fast do you think
you're gonna grow?
It should be more like
three to four years
to get your money back.
Guys, let ?? let me put it
this way ??
Rather than fight
about the equity here,
because I?I actually think
you're overvalued a little bit,
I would do the deal this way.
I'd give you the $500,000
for 4% equity,
and I'd want a dollar
a unit,
'cause your margins
are so crazy high,
until I get back
a $1.5 million,
and then the royalty
goes away forever.
But, I mean, I think you guys
are fantastic operators.
What do you say, guys?
Would you do that royalty
till you get $1 million back?
I'd do it $1.2 million.
Can we go to $1 million?
Can we make it $1 million?
I'd do that deal.
I'd do the deal.
Now you got some action going,
don't you?
Kevin and Josh's
device?protection company,
PHOOZY.
Can we go to $1 million?
Can we make it $1 million?
I'd do that deal.
I'd do the deal.
Now you got some action going,
don't you?
I will do the $500,000
for the 4%
until I get
the $500,000 back.
Same royalty.
Okay.
Let me tell you
what I think of this, okay?
You blow me away at the job
that you did by yourselves
in design,
manufacturing, marketing.
So what's your offer?
$500,000, 4% equity,
a dollar per unit
to $1 million,
and then the royalty
will go away.
I'll stick it
to $500,000.
Guys, this is ??
you are great operators.
This is an operations
business.
I love the B2B play.
That's where I can help you.
You realize you're just getting
your capital back, Robert.
More is great.
You don't need to do that.
Yes, you do,
because what you don't know
is what can get you
in trouble.
Absolutely.
So you need experience,
and you need someone
that can help you
from falling into some pitfalls.
Would you guys
want to work together?
I would partner with Robert
<i>if</i> we each got 4% equity.
Yeah.
At the $500,000 royalty?
Will you match
Robert's deal on that,
till you get your money back
and you each get 4%?
Come on, Lori.
What's $500,000?
I mean, this is
an operations thing,
Let's just get our money back.
I think that's super fair.
My feeling is
if you go $1.50
royalty per,
then I'm good
with that deal.
You have a great margin.
It's not gonna matter to you...
Just to put pressure...
...but it's gonna matter to me.
...let me modify my offer,
just to squeeze
their heads a bit.
I want the royalty
to be $1.50.
Then tell them
what the offer is.
Okay.
I'll do this deal ??
$500,000 for 2.5%,
and I'd want $1 a unit
until I get $1 million back.
Why give up 8%
if you really believe
in the equity?
Why would you give up
8% equity
and only get $500,000?
Why would you do that?
That's a great deal, Lori.
They get the both of us.
Because you get
the both of us,
and think about it.
They're not that valuable.
I mean, that makes
no sense to me.
But you guys think
about it.
That is not
an economic decision.
Think how much faster
you're gonna grow.
You're gonna dominate
the market with these.
Yeah.
She's right.
Inglis: Robert and Lori
were very passionate
about our product,
and they were such big fans
of Kevin and I,
we had to do
the deal with them.
They even gave us a higher
valuation than we came in with.
We've seen a lot of episodes
of "Shark Tank"
where that was not the case,
so we're very grateful.
O'Leary:
That's the stupidest deal
I've ever seen you do
on "Shark Tank."
That's an unbelievably
dumb deal.
The thing that you didn't
really focus on
or think about
is licensing.
The man is loaded
with patents.
It doesn't matter, Lori.
?Yes.
?Yes!
This product is so amazing.
You have no upside
on your capital
and only equity risk.
They are the Sharks,
and you are the tin foil.
N?N?No!
No!
Kevin, screw you.
Learn, grasshopper.
Listen to the Shark
and learn.
Dumbest deal
I've ever seen.
