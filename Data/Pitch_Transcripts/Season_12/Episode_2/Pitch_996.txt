Hi, Sharks. My name is Elly.
I'm from San Francisco,
California,
and I am seeking $500,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company...
?Hello.
?Wow. Wow.
?...BootayBag.
?Ha.
BootayBag is an affordable,
comfortable,
and convenient way
for women to shop
for underwear.
I started BootayBag because
I was sick of going to the mall,
the semi?annual sales,
the clearance bins,
the sales clerks.
I wanted to give women
that sexy feeling
of sliding on
a new pair of underwear
without all the hassle
or expensive price tag.
So, here's how it works.
You select how many pairs
you want to receive in a month,
your size, your style option,
and for just $10, we'll deliver
your new favorite undies
all without leaving
the comfort of your couch.
Our mission is to not only
bring a necessity to women
at an affordable price,
but to create a community
that represents all women.
This brand is made
for women, by women,
and with every pair purchased,
we donate to women in need.
So, Sharks, who's with me
in making all women feel good
in their undies?
?Terrific pitch.
?Amazing.
Elly, is it
a subscription service?
Gheno: Yes, it is.
It's a monthly subscription.
You're not committed
to anything.
So, you can get
one pair for $10
or two for $15.
You can get all four for $20.
And that's every month I burn
through four underwear?
Yes, I knew
you were gonna say that.
?Yeah.
?You can skip
or cancel at any time,
but you can also go in
and switch your styles
or downgrade or upgrade.
Two pair ??
?Are these the samples?
?Yes.
?Can we, like, look at them?
'Cause I'm dying.
?Oh, sorry, guys. Yes, yes, yes.
?I want to ??
?Dig in. Everyone gets some.
And this is how I get it?
Yes, yes.
Like, in this ??
"Hello, babe, I'm here"?
"Hello, babe, I'm here."
Yeah.
So, okay. And you're
manufacturing the underwear?
Yes. So, it's my design.
I stuffed them extra,
so you guys have bralettes
in there, as well,
which I know will look fabulous
on you, Mr. Wonderful.
?Wow. Sexy.
?Is this making you ??
You know, Elly,
there's been a lot of ??
Lookit.
?Mark's blushing over there.
?I'm not blushing!
He got a little G?string,
that's why.
He's like ?? Yeah, I feel like
I see you blushing
a little bit.
So, how did you
get started in ??
I mean, where did this
come from?
I know, right? Well,
my parents are entrepreneurs.
So, although I thought I was not
paying attention my entire life,
I clearly was.
But I also was, like,
always a hustler,
always liked money,
like, lemonade stands ??
Girl power.
Oh, my God.
Hell yeah, sister.
[ Laughs ]
We have to talk. Yes.
When I turned 18,
my mom owns a hair salon,
and I spent all my summers
kind of, like, helping her out,
and I just felt like,
"This is kind of my path.
I'm gonna take over the salon."
And I kind of stumbled upon
going underwear shopping
and waiting for the five for $25
and going and digging through
the bins, and I was like, "Ugh.
This is, like, such a terrible
shopping experience,"
and I was like, "Hell,
I'm gonna just do this.
It's gonna be easy."
I had a website within two days
and borrowed $300 and ??
?$300?
?When was that?
2016.
And since then,
what has sales looked like?
Year to date,
we've done $3 million.
?$3 million?
?Wow!
?Son of a gun!
?Wow.
?$3 million?
?Yeah.
?Amen, sister. You're amazing!
?Thank you. Thank you.
That's amazing!
Well, you've inspired me.
I actually saw your panel
four years ago,
and you rocked my world.
?Oh, cool.
?So, I have to say,
like, being here
is so [bleep] cool.
You know,
you started with $300,
but how much have you raised
since then?
So, I've raised none.
I have no debt.
Wow.
You've raised no dollars?
No. I'm hoping to raise today.
How did you pay
for the inventory?
I just went to the store,
I got clearance underwear,
and I did the packaging.
[ Laughs ]
And then I graduated from that,
and then I was like,
"Oh, online,
where can I buy bulk underwear?"
And then I found a manufacturer,
and I did private label,
and I graduated all the steps,
and, actually, my demand
forced me to figure out
how to produce my own line.
Best story I've ever heard
so far, okay?
I love this.
?Wow.
?But how did people find you
at the beginning?
?Yeah, so,
we have a huge following
on Instagram.
And how did you garner
that following?
It's all actually user?generated
content on our feed.
So, we have real women posting.
We don't edit our content,
so it's as you come.
O'Leary: Just one last number.
Yeah.
Cumulative lifetime sales.
Yeah, so, $15 million to date.
?Wow.
?I mean, $300
to $15 million in sales.
?Unreal.
It really is.
?Elly! You're a rock star!
Guys, I was so nervous!
I'm so excited! Thank you!
You should be!
The one thing that I think
is getting everybody so excited,
'cause it's really
worth talking about,
is every other
subscription service...
?Yeah.
?...has to raise a ton of money
early on to acquire customers.
?Right. Right.
You should be
rolling in the dough.
Gheno: So, yeah, so ??
Why are you coming here
and asking for $500,000?
Yeah. So, our production
actually is ??
I use a broker right now.
In a proper scenario,
if I did have the direct
factory connection,
I would be able
to have shorter lead times.
I'm working on extremely long
lead times, because I'm just ??
What are your lead times
right now?
They're about eight months
to nine months.
?Whoa. Eight months?
?Wha?? Eight mo??
So, you're designing
a product,
and you don't get it in?house
for eight to nine months?
?Yeah.
?Why is that?
So, I'm kind of in their mercy.
I'm very small on some of
the scales that they do.
Why don't you partner
with the manufacturer
so that you never
have inventory?
Well, that's why
I'm kind of here.
Cuban:
That's why she's here, yeah.
You know, it's my first go
at all this, and so I'm kind of
just figuring it out as I go.
So, you really haven't
made any money yet.
I mean, we net 5%.
Whoa.
Elly only makes a small profit
on the huge sales
of her lingerie subscription
business, BootayBag.
So, you really haven't
made any money yet.
I mean, we net 5%.
Whoa.
Successful clothiers that have
real scale make 15% pre?tax.
?Yeah. Yeah.
?You're at 5%,
so there's 10% of cost in here,
and I think I'm gonna
find it all in the inventory.
Yeah.
And so you got to
get rid of that.
You got to partner.
It's worth giving up some of
this equity to your manufacturer
to solve this problem.
?Yes.
Yes. You nailed it.
But in order to make money,
I need to be big,
and I have
manufacturing problems.
You're serving almost
as a retail store for them.
?Right.
?They manufacture,
then they wholesale it to you.
?Right.
And you're kind of
at their mercy,
'cause you're not going direct
to the factory.
Yeah. Totally,
and they know me, as well.
So, in the four years
I've grown up with them,
they've never been
"a partner" to me.
How are they treating you?
I'm just curious.
?Terribly. Absolutely terrible.
?They treat you terribly?
?Unbelievable.
Are they men?
?Yeah, are they women or men?
Um, men, yes.
?What a surprise.
?Yeah.
They have never, ever
been flexible with me.
They've made me take product
that was actually, you know,
stained or damaged,
and, like, I just had to do it.
They don't ?? You should have
just sent it back and said no.
Well, they know
that every month,
I have to, on the 15th,
put out product.
So, this is a real pain point
for you?
It is, yeah,
and that's why I'm here.
You know, Elly, I love you,
first of all.
Oh, my God. Cool!
I love you, too!
I am so impressed with you.
Thank you.
What you have created
with $300,
how you have harnessed the power
of social media,
you're creating a movement
around your brand...
Yeah. Hell yeah.
...which is so unbelievable.
You know my story.
I started with $500
out of my extra bedroom.
I know.
The first few years,
my margins also
were not what they are today,
because I wasn't able to harness
great manufacturing deals.
I didn't have
the production I needed.
But over the last 18 years,
those things have been able
to change, right?
I don't want you
to have to wait 18 years.
And I didn't
take an investor
for the first 10 years
I ran my business.
I did it on credit card debt,
lines of credit, LLCs ??
I mean, you name it.
It was hard, right?
And one of the things I wish
I would have done earlier
is bring in somebody
as an investor
who had a vested interest
that could have helped propel me
quicker than taking 18 years,
and I think I'm the Shark
that can do that for you.
I'm gonna go out, Elly,
because I think you've got
some good choices.
Elly, there's one other thing
to consider.
?Yes.
?I have Rounderbum,
men's augmented underwear.
Yes, you do! Remember them?
[ Laughter ]
And I tell you,
I'm the only Shark
in the underwear business
right now,
and I make a lot of men happy.
Well, listen,
I'm so proud of you
and everything
that you have accomplished,
but Kendra and Barbara
have made you a great offer,
so I'm going to go out.
You have to decide.
We have one offer here, okay?
Kendra and I combined for 20%
of your business for $500,000,
and then you have this guy,
whatever he's gonna talk about.
Why give up 20%?
That's so greedy.
And the valuation on that is ??
But look
what you're getting.
Um...
Would you guys go up
to $700,000 for 20%?
?Wow.
?For ??
$700,000 for 20%?
?Yeah.
?Who's a Shark?
Absolutely not.
?Yeah.
?No.
You're not worth
$10 million today. You're not.
And when you bring on
the right team,
that is worth more than
you could ever put on a check.
Right.
But you have to feel
comfortable with that, too.
Yeah.
