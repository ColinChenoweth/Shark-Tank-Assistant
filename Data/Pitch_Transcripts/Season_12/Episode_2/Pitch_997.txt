Hi. My name's Nahum Jeannot,
and I'm seeking $150,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company, GoOats.
Sharks, we all know
breakfast is the most important
meal of the day.
But in your busy morning, the
last thing you want to be doing
is spending time
making breakfast.
And let's be honest ??
A granola bar is not a meal.
Your morning meal
should be effortless.
We all know oatmeal is
a hearty way to start the day,
but who wants to stand here
at the stove
and whisk this slimy mess?
Who wants to juggle a spoon
and a bowl as they drive?
Well, breakfast and snacking
just got a whole lot simpler.
Let's get rid of this mess.
?Whoa.
?[ Chuckles ]
Sharks, today, I give you
the first?ever
oatmeal in a ball.
Same ingredients you might
put in your oatmeal at home ??
milk, butter, sugar,
steel?cut oats.
We're doing the work for you,
but we're making them
bite?sized, handheld,
in a heat?and?eat format.
It's so simple to prepare, for
creamy oatmeal within minutes.
It's that simple.
Who's ready to try GoOats'
oatmeal in a ball?
?All I need to know.
?How did you start making
oatmeal balls?
How did this start?
At 16 years old,
I had my first opportunity
to work in a restaurant.
I started off as a busboy,
then a food runner.
In the middle of a shift
on a Saturday night, a cook ??
I guess it was too busy.
A cook walked off the line.
The owner comes running in.
She's like,
"Hey, I need a cook."
And that was over 16 years ago,
and I never looked back.
So, basically, after that stint
in the restaurant,
I decided, "Okay, this is
what I want to do with my life,"
and so I embarked
on my culinary journey.
I got to work at awesome places
like Four Seasons Philadelphia,
W Hotels,
and most recent, Hyatt Regency
in Tysons Corner.
?Wow.
?And so, I was the head chef.
They asked me
to write a breakfast menu
that our guests
could easily pick up,
walk around the hotel with
without making a mess.
The response that I got,
I was like, "Wait a second.
There's something different
about this one."
And that's ??
So, that was in 2015.
I'm like, "You know what?
I'm gonna share this
with the rest of the world."
Nahum, I have to interrupt you.
I love that story.
This ??
I'm an oatmeal lover.
Ah.
This is better than oatmeal.
It is so good.
It's really, really,
really good, man.
It's crispy on the outside,
and it's creamy on the inside.
Let me just tell you ??
I don't eat breakfast.
I'm not a breakfast eater.
I would eat this all day.
And I'm always
running late...
Yeah.
...'cause I have three boys.
And getting them out the door
in the morning is a nightmare,
so we'll do cereal bars
or something if they're ??
You know, I'll have breakfast
sometimes served,
and they never have time.
They're getting their backpacks.
They're throwing their stuff in.
Yeah.
So, this is really cute
as a package,
but the whole point is,
is that you've got to heat it.
No. So ?? So, wait for this one.
?Okay. Waiting for it.
?Wait for it.
That box can go into the oven
and be baked.
?Wow.
?What?
?Well, there you go.
?The reason ??
Okay.
?Just like this?
Yes. Just like that. Yes.
How long do you
have to bake this?
How long does that take?
?So, from frozen,
it takes about 10 to 15 minutes.
Oh. But it says microwave
for 30 to 60 seconds.
Greiner:
Wait, you can microwave it?
?That's the microwave option.
?Mark.
When you're hungry and you want
something you trust,
and particularly if I could take
something like this in the box,
pop it in the microwave
for a minute,
grab and go and drive and eat,
'cause I'm a driver?eater.
Me, too. It must be
a Texas thing, don't you think?
?Must be, right?
?Yeah. Must be.
Must be. And so,
that's efficiency to me.
So, do you sell them like this
or only like this?
So, right now, we ?? we're
selling them in the pouches.
Oh. Wow.
That's what we created.
They're being sold
currently in Whole Fo??
O'Leary: This is just for ??
But that keeps them good, right?
Where are they being sold?
These three,
when you say 170 calories,
which is what it says here...
?Yes.
...is that three,
or is that ??
?That's for three.
?Okay.
How quickly can you
get the boxes out?
?It's already set up.
?Okay.
?So let's talk about your sales.
?Sure.
First year,
we did $13,000 in sales.
And what year was that?
2017. 2018, we did $57,000.
Okay. And 2019?
2019 was about $54,000
to $57,000.
It was pretty much flat.
And how are you selling them?
March of 2017,
I walked into a Whole Foods.
At that time, Whole Foods
was allowed to bring in
local products in their region.
And so, while I still had
my full?time job,
I'm going into production
during the week ??
Making them yourself?
You're putting them
in the package
and delivering them
to the stores?
?Yes. Yes, sir.
?At least you're hustling
to see if there's any
proof of concept, right?
Exactly. I'm proving
the concept.
?Is it selling through?
?Yes.
So, you're working
a full?time job still?
I got laid off in March
due to COVID.
All our hotel business left.
?Oh, my.
?I know for a lot of people,
that would be, like, a negative.
I was actually ?? I looked at it
as a blessing...
?Yeah. I think so, too.
?...you know, from God,
because I get to work on GoOats
full?time.
So, what do you sell
this bag for?
I sell it into distribution
at $2.66.
?That's all?
?Yeah.
And what does it
cost you to make?
$1.35.
Well, that's the problem.
You're not charging enough.
They sell it for $4.99.
That's not enough.
?Okay.
?That is not enough.
Everything above your cost
has to have $1 added to it,
'cause you're not making enough
margins to scale this business.
I'd like to make you
an offer.
I'll give you the $150,000,
as you asked,
but I will have to have 25%.
Ouch.
Okay.
And the second thing ??
I'm gonna help you
with the big box stores.
Once you start getting
into big box stores,
you're gonna have
slotting fees.
Just getting your phone call
met, it is a nightmare.
Very few people are able
to navigate that and do it well.
So, for that 25%,
you will have my help on that,
and I know that landscape
like the back of my hand.
So, $150,000 for 25%.
What do you say?
?Do I have the option
to kind of, like, hear out
if there's anything else?
I appreciate your offer.
No, I don't want to be ??
I really don't care for
to be shopped around,
but you can certainly give me
a counter if you wish.
So, I would ??
Nahum, this is
a moment of focus,
because the risk you have is,
if you don't nail this deal,
you don't know
if there's more to come.
?Burn that.
?If there isn't,
you're giving her
tremendous leverage.
So, you really need help, buddy.
I mean, you really do.
Why don't you be quiet,
Mr. Wonderful?
I do need the help, but ??
And I love Barbara.
[ Laughter ]
For that amount of equity, like,
I was hoping
that maybe I could ??
Like, who's your best friend
on the panel?
You know, who do you
get along with the most?
Like, could you
pull them into it?
Well, let me tell you
who I don't like.
I don't like Mr. Wonderful
at all.
Oka?? Okay.
But I love Mark
'cause he's a billionaire.
Now, what does that
have to do with it?
My hope is that,
like, I can ??
I was hoping we could
have a conversation.
If we're gonna go
that high in equity,
like, maybe you could bring one
of your friend?? Like ??
Let me tell you what's wrong
with having two Sharks
on a deal.
You wind up immediately
forming a committee.
I have to check ??
Let's say I bring Mark in.
I check with Mark.
Mark says, "Hey, let's see
what Barbara thinks."
It goes back and forth.
I try to call Lori,
it takes me two weeks
to get a return call,
and that's the truth, okay?
She's so full of it.
But then I call
her husband,
and he calls me back,
'cause he's always
wanted to date me.
So it goes on and on and on.
[ Laughter ]
?Bubba!
?That's amazing.
I don't blame him.
So, you're better off
with one Shark
in the same way you're better
with one wife.
You can hyper?focus on her
and make her happy.
?Of course.
?I can make you happy.
Okay.
Do you have a counteroffer?
Would you be willing
to do 150 grand
for 15%?
No, it's just too low.
What do you say
we compromise at 20%?
Jeannot: Barbara believes
not only in me, right,
but she also believes
in the product,
and that's who
I want on my team,
and the joke's gonna be
on all the other Sharks.
