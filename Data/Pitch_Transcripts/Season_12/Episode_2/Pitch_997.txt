Hello, Sharks.
My name is Tracy Rosensteel,
and I'm from, Barbara,
New York City.
?Yeah.
?[ Laughs ]
I'm here seeking
a $250,000 investment
in exchange for 12% equity
in my company.
So let's get down to "business."
We all know that dogs...
well, dogs poop,
and they poop a lot.
There's an estimated
22 billion pounds of doggy doody
dropped each year
in this country alone.
What?
[ Laughing ] Ew.
You know what that
makes me think, Sharks?
That is a heaping, huge mound
of stinky...opportunity.
[ Laughter ]
So, what happens
to all that waste?
There are millions
of pet parents
who can attest to using
single?use plastic bags
that are discarded and end up
in landfills each and every day.
One common denominator of every
product that's on the market
that's "eco?friendly"
is plastic.
Sharks, allow me
to introduce you to Pooch Paper,
a paper alternative
to plastic dog waste bags.
Pooch Paper is already recycled,
non?chlorine?bleached paper
that's 100% compostable,
100% biodegradable,
made right here in the USA,
and manufactured
using renewable energy.
So, in three
very simple steps ??
simply take
the piece of Pooch Paper,
grab your doggie's doody,
no matter how big or small...
[ Laughter ]
...twist the sides of the paper,
which, by the way, on both sides
is grease?resistant,
and then toss in the trash.
So, Sharks, nature is calling,
and Pooch Paper is picking up.
Who's gonna help me save
this planet one pup at a time?
[ Chuckles ]
That was great.
?This is amazing. I love it.
?Tracy ?? Tracy, big issue here
about this, okay?
I'm gonna tell you
a quick story,
and then you'll have to answer
this question.
Rosensteel: Okay.
O'Leary:
When I first moved to Boston ??
It was maybe the first week
I was there ??
I was up at 4:00, I had
my lights on in the kitchen,
and a man with a Great Dane
was wal??
It was February,
and the man was walking the dog.
He looked around,
and our eyes met,
and I knew at that moment,
he was very unhappy,
because I saw him.
I saw the steaming ??
And he had to pick it up.
And that piece of paper
would not even pick up <i>half</i>
of that steaming tower.
Alright. So, these are 12x12.
Later this year, we'll be
releasing a SKU that's 15x15,
so larger.
?Now we're talking.
?Yeah, which makes sense.
?That's my question.
So, if you have
a really big beast,
and it's laying down
serious traction ??
Scott: A pony.
Are you talking about you,
Kevin, or a dog?
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
?I love it!
?I like her.
So, for me, when I walk my dog,
I can't be carrying this.
So, what I like
about my poop bags right now
is that they're in a very
convenient little holder,
so when they do decide to go,
I could just grab it out, right?
Right.
And how do I hold these?
So, I've partnered with somebody
who has a product,
and I just resell it,
and it's a 3x3 canvas pouch,
zip?pouch,
and then it has a snap
that you can put on your leash,
you can put it
on your belt buckle,
your wrist, or your stroller.
And you sell those?
I do sell those, yeah.
Tell us about you.
What's your background?
So, like Kevin, I've spent
20 years on Wall Street.
I work actually
in trading floor technology
on the Board of Trade.
?I get it.
Wall Street, dog poop.
Same thing.
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary:
But I'm interested, Tracy.
You know, concerns flow away
when you have sales.
Rosensteel: Numbers.
Are there any?
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, there are.
So, we have been on the market
for about seven months.
Sales since inception
are just shy of $50,000.
$50,000.
So, Tracy, what does
one box cost,
and what does it
cost you to make?
So, it costs me $3.66 landed.
I wholesale it for $6.99.
It retails at $12.99.
?Got it.
That's a 48% margin.
Okay, so because
you're from Wall Street,
this is gonna be
very easy to do.
$250,000 for 12%.
I'm just ?? The leap of faith to
give you a $2 million valuation
when you've only got
$50,000 in sales,
you see any problem with that,
Wall Street Tracy?
[ Both laugh ]
I don't. I think that we're set
to reach at least $400,000
by the end of this year.
We are now
in 82 stores nationwide,
and we're selling online,
and then we're about
one week away
from launching in 1,061 stores
for Target nationwide.
Wow.
Tracy, I mean, it's
a great business for you,
but it's not something
I get excited about.
Congratulations, but
for those reasons, I'm out.
I think your price point is high
compared to the competition,
the common competition,
which is plastic,
and I think
that's an obstacle.
For those reasons, I'm out.
I think your mission
is fantastic.
I think that
to bring on a partner,
it doesn't seem necessary.
You really know your stuff.
You're doing
all the right things.
I don't think that you need
to give away equity.
I'm not gonna give you an offer
because I just don't think
you need it.
I'm out.
O'Leary:
Okay, Wall Street Tracy,
I'll make you an offer
in two ways, okay?
$250,000 for 50%,
so we're partners,
or I'll do it for a $1 royalty
in perpetuity with no equity.
Hmm.
Okay, so, I like
the in?perpetuity idea
with no equity position
very much.
?Yeah.
?$1 is a bit steep.
Nope. I'll tell you why.
You see, our interests
will be 100% aligned
if I'm getting a royalty,
even though I don't own
any of the business,
because I'll do everything
in my power to increase sales.
Just to show that, you know,
what my thinking is,
'cause I have other deals
with royalties,
Wicked Good Cupcakes
just paid me
their millionth dollar royalty.
I own no equity. Our interests
are totally aligned.
It's the biggest royalty deal
in "Shark Tank" history,
and if you ask her,
she's very happy.
So, those are my offers.
I've given you two structures.
Pick one.
?[ Chuckles ]
Greiner: Yeah, honestly,
I think it's a good offer.
She's out. What are you
listening to her for?
No, I'm saying
it's a good offer!
Can you believe it?
I never say that about you.
I mean, Tracy ??
You got to sell
1/4 million of these.
Put him to work for you
selling ??
You've solved a problem.
I mean, you've solved
a big problem,
and you are
helping the earth.
So, thank you for that.
And people love their pets,
and they will spend crazy money
on their pets.
So I think
you're onto something,
but I do think that
Mr. Wonderful's offer
is fantastic.
I think he'd be
a great partner for you.
He's a better Shark for this,
so I'm out.
What do you want to do, Tracy?
?I'd like to counter.
?Go ahead.
I do very much like your
in?perpetuity deal, no equity,
but it's going to put a damper
a little bit also
on my short?term cash flow.
?Tracy understands cash flow!
?She does.
?I like it.
?She does.
No, no. I'll tell you
why it won't ??
because I will be
doing two things.
I think I got to
figure out a way
to lower your costs somewhere.
You got to pick one.
I'll do either deal.
?Kevin!
?Good job, Tracy!
?Hallelujah.
?Congratulations.
?Congrats.
?I'm very much excited...
?Thank you.
?...about working with you,
Wall Street Tracy.
Congratulations, Tracy.
Well done.
?Congratulations.
?Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a home run
for you.
No, I think it's good.
Rosensteel:
For Kevin to come in right now
at such a critical moment,
but I still am in a position
of protecting 100% of my equity,
and Kevin's also on the book
with me in perpetuity.
