My name is Dr. Juan Salinas,
and I'm the founder and CEO
of Perfect Life Nutrition.
Sharks, I have a PhD
in food science.
For 25 years, I created snacks
with some of the largest food
companies in the United States.
The problem was, none of
the stuff we made was healthy.
We only made stuff
to taste good.
Being that I'm also
a certified sports nutritionist,
I decided to make
something better.
I want to introduce you
to P?nuff Crunch.
It's the first nutrition?based
crunchy peanut puff snack.
It's not only delicious,
but it's also
healthy and nutritious.
But, Sharks, why do I care
about that?
'Cause I'm not just a doctor.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm also a former
competitive bodybuilder.
[ All exclaim ]
Corcoran: Now we're talking.
Now we're talking.
Oh, excuse me!
And I care
what I put in my body.
And so should you.
Oh!
[ Laughter ]
I like this pitch.
Sharks, it's made
from high?quality
plant?based protein, healthy
carbohydrate, and fiber.
Now, these components
are essential
for long?lasting energy
and satisfaction,
but they're also good
for, uh, building muscle...
Cut it out.
Oof!
...and staying fit.
Oh, oh!
If Kevin eats this,
is he gonna look like you?
If I make a deal with Kevin,
I will have you look like this
in three months.
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Now, who's ready to get fit...
[ Grunts ]
?Whoa.
Oh.
?Wow.
?...and tough...
Oh.
?...with P?nuff?
?Ohh!
[ Laughter ]
Okay, so, try them all, right?
No, before that, I'm gonna
give you $300,000 for 10%.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my, oh, my.
Okay, let me calm down.
So, you have
three flavors there.
The original is the orange,
which is roasted peanut.
Mmm.
The other one's
a roasted peanut and cinnamon,
and then, we have
a roasted peanut and cocoa.
How much sugar is in this stuff?
3 grams in the original,
which is very low.
What's the price
for these at retail,
and what's it cost you
to make?
So, retail, we sell
between $3.29 and $3.99,
which is in line with everything
else on the healthy snack area.
?Okay.
?It costs $1.70...
?$1.70 landed?
?...to the distributor.
It costs me to make 75 cents.
Hello! Okay,
$1.70 to the distributor.
55% margins.
?75 cents, all in?
?All in.
Okay, you have 3 grams of fiber,
5 grams of protein.
?Yes.
?Calories aren't bad,
130 calories.
So, that's all good.
This is what's so cool
about this product, right?
It's beyond
the healthy snacking.
It goes into
nutritious snacking.
So, the protein is high?quality
complete protein,
which for a plant?based product
is very difficult to get.
Juan, did you say you were
a doctor, nutritionalist,
and a bodybuilder?
?Yes.
?What's your story?
So, I came here
when I was 16 years old.
I'm from Honduras,
and I came really to realize
the American dream.
I didn't know English.
I flew right into
Newark, New Jersey,
and I wanted to go back home.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't blame you.
My dad really instilled into us
that education
was the most important thing,
and that's what I did.
I went to Rutgers University.
I got my degree there
with honors.
Then I got my Master's
in food science
and a PhD in food science.
?Wow.
?Wow.
I worked for the largest food
company in the United States,
then I worked for
the second?largest food company,
and then I became the go?to guy
because I was combining
chocolates with gels
and puddings and bars
and cereals.
So, you were a formulator?
I'm a formulator.
If you have a food company,
I know how to make your stuff.
To me, this is almost
like a dessert snack.
?Right.
?But you're selling this
next to potato chips.
Where is this sitting,
and who are you distributing it
to right now?
Yeah, so, on the shelf,
it actually sits
next to the healthier options.
And we sell through distributors
right now.
We're in 450 stores.
We're actually also overseas.
What do your sales
amount to?
That's a wide distribution.
Yes.
So, last year, we did $104,000.
Let me tell you
a little bit about ??
That's not that impressive
in the snack category.
It's not. But I started
4 1/2 years ago with this brand.
Now I own
a manufacturing facility,
and there's a reason for that.
The peanuts,
it's a great product,
but my core manufacturers
hate it.
They hate it
because it contaminates
everything else that they make
in the same line.
?Oh.
?Right?
Because of the contamination
of peanut oils, right?
Correct. It got to a point
it was like,
"I need to buy my own line,"
because there isn't any company
in the East Coast
that could make this product.
And we didn't get going
until 2019,
and, therefore,
that's why the sales are there.
So, because you got kicked out
of facility after facility,
you decided to open
your own facility?
Yeah, so I decided
to borrow $250,000
from my brothers.
Wow.
And I put in my own line.
So, you put 250K into that?
And $135,000 of my own,
so $375,000 total.
And what's your business
been like year to date?
?You said you did ??
?Oh, we're $65,000.
So, what, you've done $65,000
halfway through the year?
Right. COVID?19 had
a big effect on us.
It sounds like
you're gonna be flat
if you do another $100,000,
$110,000 this year.
$200,000 by the end of the year.
$1.5 million by next year.
?But it's hard to get excited
about valuing this business
at $3 million,
even though you're
a very credible entrepreneur
in this space.
Plant?based snacks right now
are a $35 billion business.
I get that.
?Growing a 9% ??
?I don't have to tell you,
the snack business
is primarily shelf placement.
And at eye level, you see all
the guys you used to work for.
Yeah, it is brutal.
It is brutal.
They control that space,
and they don't like giving up
shelf space to anybody.
Is there anybody else
who is making a peanut,
plant?based puff?
We're the only manufacturing
that can make this product.
That's one of the reasons
why I'm here
looking at you guys
as strategic partners.
My strength is not
in marketing or sales.
I don't know.
I think you did a fantastic job
when you came out.
?[ Laughs ]
I don't know about ??
Right?
So, I'm gonna tell you
a quick story.
One day, I come home, and
these things are in the pantry.
My wife had bought them.
So, I do what I always do ??
gluten?free, 130 calories.
I ate the whole
frickin' bag.
I loved it.
My wife was so pissed...
Wow.
...because she couldn't find it
anywhere else.
Who knew?
I wanted more.
So, I'm gonna make you an offer,
and it's either yes or no.
So, I'll give you the 300K.
I want 25%.
Whew!
I'm gonna change your life.
Juan is seeking $300,000
for a 10% stake
in P?nuff Crunch,
a healthy peanut?based snack.
Mark is offering
$300,000 for 25%.
You just got to
let me know, right?
Because it's gonna be worth
a whole lot more.
Listen, Mark, I know you know
this is gonna be
a $100 million brand
in five, six years.
Right, but not just with you.
?Juan, are you crazy?
?Wow.
I've been working with Mark
for over a decade now,
and I've never seen him
more excited about a product.
What are you waiting for?
That is an amazing offer.
Juan, there's nothing
to think about.
20%, Mark.
Come on.
Let's do this.
Wow.
20%, man.

Let's go!
[ All cheering ]
$400,000 for 25%.
Yeah!
Wow, that was scary.
?Good!
?I'll get naked. Come on.
[ Laughs ]
?Scary.
?You don't want to see this.
?Yeah, yeah, yeah.
?Oh, my God.
[ Laughter ]
?I don't want to embarrass him.
?I love that. I love that.
Congrats, Juan.
We're gonna make a lot of money.
Amazing.
We're gonna make a lot of money.
That's a great deal.
Juan, I'm gonna invite you
to my beach house
to give you my best advice.
[ Laughter ]
?Thank you, guys.
?Thank you, Juan.
?Congrats.
?Great job.
Yes! Got him.
So, my parents really sacrificed
a lot for me to be here today.
[ Breathing shakily ]
[ Voice breaking ]
They have given so much for me
just to be here right now.
They sacrificed so much
to send me to school.
It's been 35 years
since I got here,
and finally, you know,
you get to a stage
where you're just like,
everything ?? all the work
and all the sacrifices
are finally working, you know?
They're coming to a point
where you're just like ??
Yes, this is a big milestone.
And there's much to do,
much more.
And they're gonna be so proud.
I can't wait to tell them.
