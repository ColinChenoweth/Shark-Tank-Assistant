It solves the problem
every pet owner has.
The entire process
of getting ready
is all about to change.
I would love
to work with you, but...
We're gonna do over
$4 million this year.
?Whoo!
?Whoo!
You're crushing it!
I can't be
your queen bee here.
If you disappoint
your customer, you've lost.
This is ?? This is ??
No.
[ Laughter ]
Hello, Sharks.
How are you?
These days, Kevin,
lashes are the new boobs.
Every woman wants
a bigger, better pair.
[ Laughter ]
It's not ??
As much as I love
wearing lash extensions,
I suck at putting them
on correctly.
like formaldehyde
near my eyes.
Did you know that most eyelash
extensions on the market
are applied using
the same adhesive
used in superglue?
Yes.
[ Laughter ]
All right, so, what is
the meaning of OpMD?
I am an eye surgeon.
I am an ophthalmologist.
You are. Okay.
Wow, yes.
It sure does.
Corcoran: Enormous.
I do eyelid procedures,
tumors, fractures ??
those sorts of things.
That is my specialty.
How'd I do, Anika?
Mark, I love it!
Greiner: Let me see.
Oh, my gosh!
Did you do it?
[ Laughter ]
If I can do it...
You did amazing!
How does it feel, Mark?
Oh.
Think you're gonna
keep wearing it?
Hey, it's the new
boobs, right?
My boobs are getting bigger,
so my eyelashes
have got to get bigger.
Oh, my goodness.
Greiner:
Back to a question.
So, I'm familiar
with this space.
Do you have
a patent on this?
I do not have a patent,
I created a lash
that is weightless.
You feel like
there's nothing there.
But they typically
will stay all day?
All day.
Like, I wouldn't be
in a meeting,
Up to 40 uses.
Really?
Yes, up to 40 uses,
so it's much more economical
than the traditional
lash with glue
that you can get maybe five or
six wears out of, at the most.
So, if I was ??
You know, Anika, may I say,
these look so very real.
They're not too heavy.
Most eyelashes I could
spot eight feet away.
Yes.
Yes.
These are so delicate.
They look like real ??
It's by design.
What are they
made out of?
They're made of mink.
Most of the lashes in
my collections are made of mink.
What about the minks?
How do they feel about it?
The hairs actually come
from the tail of the mink.
It's totally cruelty free.
I'm one with minks.
Oh, yeah.
So, how did you go
from doing eye surgery
to designing eyelashes?
Well, I am not
your typical doctor.
I love to look nice,
Who wouldn't? My God.
Yes.
But you're the first one
to have incredible margins.
I think I can get
the mink community behind it.
Look at them closely, Anika.
"The mink community."
"The mink community"?
The mink community is very
concerned about their tails.
I think I can
solve that problem.
Yes, very concerned.
Yes.
Anika, you know,
as much now as I am ??
as Kevin would say,
I am one with the lash,
it's not really my forte.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out, but congratulations.
Before you go out, Mark,
I have one thing to say.
So, a percentage
of all of our proceeds
goes back to helping people
who could not otherwise afford
to get eye screening exams.
Oh, that's nice.
Love that.
Good for you.
Wow.
Corcoran: One more
question, if I may.
You're presenting
such an ideal picture,
but you must
have a challenge.
I do.
Let's hear about that.
Fulfillment
is my challenge.
Well, that's not a problem.
That's a blessing.
I have grown <i>so</i> quickly,
it is very difficult ??
I'm having trouble
keeping up with fulfillment.
So, what would you use
the Shark's cash for?
What I really need
from you, Sharks ??
I need the cash,
but I really need help
with the back end.
Right now, the only reason
my margins aren't even higher
is because I am paying
so many contractors.
I would love to be able
to have access
to your back end,
to your teams.
You're saying
the supply chain?
Anika, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
in Anika's healthier fake
eyelash company, OpulenceMD.
Anika, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
Those are
fantastic numbers.
Okay, unlike
Mr. Wonderful,
I know a lot about this.
O'Leary: I am wearing
eyeliner right now.
I know a lot about this.
I wear eyeliner.
especially when you're putting
something near your eyes.
Yes.
I would feel much better
purchasing this
knowing that an eye doctor
is endorsing it
Yes.
Oh, my God!
Cuban:
Good job.
So excited!
That does it.
The mink community
is gonna hear about this.
[ Laughs ]
I am so excited!
I'm so thrilled!
I am, too.
I can't wait!
[ Laughs ]
Yeeeeeeees!
Whoo!
[ Exhales deeply ]
a line of innovative
strength?training tools.
I think you have
incredible potential.
Co?captain Daniel Lubetzky!
Whoo!
You got a deal.
Narrator:
Let's see what she's up to now.
Apgar: Come on, here we go!
Prior to "Shark Tank,"
I did $45,000 in sales.
In just one week
following "Shark Tank,"
we had $250,000 in sales.
Now, just three months later,
we have
almost $900,000 in sales.
we will be receiving $250,000
in new purchase orders.
We knew
we had something special here,
Alright, teammates.
I would tell any young girl,
entrepreneur, service member,
when you have a big dream,
seize that moment
because dreams
really do come true,
Howdy, Sharks.
in all of those gross
anti?clumping agents.
Ugh!
[ Laughs ]
talking to customers.
I'm gonna try
to do a big one.
A lot of people have
a big preference
of thin slice
or thick slice.
So, what do you do about
the wheel when it comes off?
[ Laughs ] The wheel
shouldn't come off.
It does snap
back together.
It does? Okay.
Tell you, this a very thin
slice of cheese.
It's good.
Okay, wait, this came
completely out.
Just push it right back in?
Yep, you push it
right back in.
Always.
Oh, it was great.
So, you know, naturally,
we've got the dock,
We're like,
"Man, this is ridiculous."
I'm like, "Holy smokes,
this thing kind of works."
[ Laughing ]
This is the 39th prototype
we've gone through.
O'Leary: So, it's still a
prototype or are you actually ??
39th?
No, I'm sorry. So ??
Wait, wait.
39th?
Are you actually
shipping it?
39th.
Wow.
You're actually
shipping this product?
We're not currently
shipping it yet.
So, we have $125,000
in presales that we did.
This is at Kickstarter?
Was it Kickstarter, or...
Kickstarter, yeah.
So, we did a Kickstarter.
Started at the end of April.
We ended up raising ??
This year?
This year.
So, this is pre?sales,
pre?shipping of the product.
Correct, but those are
out of our injection molds.
We hit couple speed bumps
just with COVID
There's lots of
alternative ways...
You do not sell cheese.
....to cut cheese.
Correct.
Number one,
as you know...
Here it goes.
...this device is sold
by itself to slice cheese.
Correct. The biggest
differentiation for us is,
it's gonna cost us $47,000
to fulfill all those orders.
We've spent $29,000
on our marketing,
our content, our ad spend,
everything else,
which leaves us
$49,000 profit.
Right.
Because you're waiting
for the first units.
you've got to deal with
reputational issues.
You've got to figure out
how to solve the problem.
Things tend to cascade
very quickly
Your competition is this.
I cut cheese like crazy
with this device
but, yet,
the bumblebee flies.
[ Laughs ]
So, even if you don't
know something,
you will make it happen.
Unfortunately, here,
it's so early
that I can't be
your queen bee here.
But I know that you will
make things happen,
Corcoran: Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Yeah.
Because I'm in
my anger?management class.
Hi, Sharks.
we do fine personalized
jewelry for moms.
So, Kendra,
you're kind of my idol.
Aww!
So I'm honored to be
with you here today.
That company, I have a team now
with nine people
that we've been
selling The Matte.
Three years.
So, $200,000
in three years.
Yeah.
So I sadly go out.
Thanks.
I appreciate it, Barbara.
I have three sisters.
Four girls, okay?
We shared one bathroom
growing up.
So it was two sinks
I think hotels.
I think college dorms, RVs.
I mean, there's
50 million apartments.
There's 5 million
hotel rooms.
I have made tons of cosmetic
organizers over the years.
The biggest problem
is organization
Corcoran: Nice going.
Congratulations.
Yes, he does.
Please, Lori,
respect the money.
I'm taking your Matte.
It died.
It had a horrible death.
Please.
[ Laughing ]
It did not.
Hello, Sharks.
that solves the problem
every pet owner has.
So, here's how it works.
Not everybody's.
Just mine.
If only one or two pieces have
our dog's hair on it ?? right ??
that's fine ?? I don't have to
segregate them all?
No, no, no, no.
So I just
put it in there.
It knows which is which.
That's cool.
You throw it in there,
for 15 ??
almost 20 years.
I also happened to be
a lawyer for 40 years.
So, we got together,
we started talking,
we did $640,000 in sales.
Last year, we did
$2.2 million...
Whoo!
Whoo!
Wow.
What did you make
on the $2.2 million?
We made $580,000.
Wow!
That's after you
paid yourself something?
That's with salaries
out of that.
'Cause I was gonna say...
[ High?pitched voice ]
"Oh, no, there's no sales!"
Oh, no, there's sales!
There <i>are</i> sales!
[ Normal voice ]
But there are.
Even with COVID
here now...
Yeah.
Like, we had ??
we had expected
a $5 million year,
but we're gonna do over
$4 million this year.
It gives jobs...
Yep.
Okay, guys, let me
take a shot at this...
Sure, please.
...because I like deals
with sales...
Sure.
But I am very interested in
hearing from your colleagues.
I'm sure you are.
As you should be.
Of course. That's why ??
I'm from New Jersey! Come on!
[ Laughs ]
Corcoran:
Wait, wait, wait.
I'd like to
make you an offer.
They have $250 million
in sales.
In Costco alone, we're doing
$30 million in Comfys.
Ah!
Okay.
What we're about to do
with Comfy is do an infomercial,
I scribble my notes.
In all these years,
I have never sat
I scribble my notes.
In all these years,
I have never sat
O'Leary:
That is so corny.
I'll do it for 15%, guys.
$600,000 for 15%?
You'll do it for 15%?
15%.
U.S.A., everywhere.
Cuban: Wait, wait, wait.
Well, hold on, guys.
Hold on, guys, right?
When you say to Barb,
"What can I do
to get you in?"
What are you trying to get to?
What's your goal?
Greiner: Why are you trying
to get more people in?
'Cause sometimes
that's not the best deal.
Corcoran: He just wants ??
Listen, he wants to know
he's got the best deal.
He's a businessman.
No, sometimes
it's not the best deal.
Listen, we ??
Sometimes when
the Sharks work alone,
The only debt offer's mine.
Yes.
$600,000 plus the 5% equity.
No, I think I'm gonna
go down to 15%, as well,
Congratulations.
Thanks so much!
Thank you.
Corcoran:
Congratulations, Lori.
Nicely done.
Congratulations, Lori.
Lori, it was
perfect for you.
[ Laughs ]
We did it.
I have been watching Lori
on "Shark Tank"
for all of the seasons,
