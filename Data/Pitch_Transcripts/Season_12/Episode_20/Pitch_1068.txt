My name is Tate Koenig.
I'm the Guru of Gouda,
the King of Colby?Jack,
the Bad Boy of Brie,
Master of Mozzarella,
and Sultan of Swiss,
aka "Mr. Cheese."
[ Laughter ]
Now, if you love cheese
as much as me,
it's not a question of,
"To cheese, or not to cheese,"
but rather, "What kind of cheese
do you please?"
The block or preprocessed,
sliced or grated?
[ Laughs ]
The block is more affordable
and higher quality,
but we all know
getting that perfect slice ??
it's no easy feat.
And afterwards,
it usually ends up
in some janky plastic bag,
oversized storage container,
or single?use plastic wrap
you throw away after each use.
If you do go with
the preprocessed,
sliced or grated,
it's more convenient, sure,
but it costs way more,
and it comes covered
Everybody loves cheese.
I was born in
the diary state.
I'm a Wisconsin??
Oh, I'm well aware.
I've been doing
a lot of research.
So I can come up and taste?
I'm so excited.
Yeah, so, if you want to
come over here.
Okay.
That one over there
is for you.
Oh, this side. Okay.
So, it's really simple
and easy to use.
How you do it is,
you pull right here on the side
to remove the lid.
Mm?hmm. Okay.
The second step is,
raise the handle
to the raised position.
And then, it's like
the guillotine.
I just made a nice thick
slice, though, I think.
And then you got
a perfect slice.
Oh, and then it's like
a little escal??
Yep.
Like a little, like,
moving sidewalk.
Yep.
The wheels move it.
And then, so, how to know
how thick or how thin
your slice?
You just kind of
eyeball it on the side?
Yeah, you just eyeball it.
And that was one
of the things we've learned
Tate, look, you know,
congratulations
on what you've done.
The challenge with
Kickstarter?driven sales is,
you don't really have
a lot of customer feedback yet,
not even minimal
customer feedback, right?
Tate, I would have loved to have
customer feedback on this.
No question, all right?
I know you're almost
pre?revenue in the sense
that Kickstarter, to me,
doesn't mean much.
What matters to me
is a long history ??
at least a year worth
of sales ??
'cause I actually think
your price point of $39.95
is $10 too high.
Okay.
It's a $29.95 item.
Yep.
I'm the dairy state
girl over here.
I love cheese.
But I've got to tell you,
this needs some work.
When I was trying to do it,
it did get stuck.
And you may need
further testing,
further time to perfect it,
because on Mark's point,
if you don't have
the product right
and you ship it out too soon
and you disappoint
your customer, you've lost.
This product
has to be perfect.
For all of those
reasons, I'm out,
but I congratulate you
on taking that risk,
taking that chance.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Greiner: You know, let me
tell you a little story.
So, aerodynamically,
the bumblebee should not
be able to fly.
Its little wings are too small
for its fat little body,
Corcoran: You know what's
great about you, Tate?
What's that?
For every 10 people
who have an idea,
one person maybe eventually
does something with it.
You saw it,
and the same day,
you turned around
and got it going,
and you actually
turned out a product.
And you raised funding
on Kickstarter.
There's probably
a thousand people
who couldn't do that,
so you've got a great start.
Right.
I think the weakness
to your product,
from my view as a consumer,
is that I love cheese,
and I typically have
four or five
kinds of cheeses
in my fridge.
Right.
And they probably all store
in that kind of space ??
that much space.
So I can't envision myself
using all this space
to store one cheese,
and then having three or four
more in addition to that.
Okay.
And so, it's not a product
that appeals to me,
but that doesn't mean
it wouldn't appeal to everybody.
But I do commend you
how quickly you got it going,
and even though
you might leave here
being a little discouraged
that you didn't get our cash...
Right.
...it's only because
it's too early.
You haven't proved it yet.
But for those reasons,
because you're too early,
I am out.
Okay, fair enough.
Good luck, Tate. Man,
congrats on what you've done.
?All right.
?Yeah, good luck, Tate.
Keep working,
getting this going.
Have a good day.
Take care, Tate.
Wow.
?Bye.
?Bye?bye.
Koenig: We're taking this
as a little bit of a speed bump.
It definitely sucks,
and it's kind of a kick
in the you?know?where,
but we're gonna
get through it.
We're gonna keep going
and keep chopping cheese.
Cuban: So, Lori, did we
really have to hear
the bumblebee story?
Don't you like hearing
about the bumblebee?
No, it's a stupid story.
It's not stupid!
Very bad story.
[ Laughter ]
What I wanted
to say was,
"This is never going to work.
It's going to go to zero,
and you've wasted your time."
What stopped you, Kevin?
in the United States,
Canada, China,
and all
the European Union countries,
dealing with
a United States manufacturer
is just too expensive.
So, what we're gonna use every
dollar of the investment is,
bringing manufacturing
in?house...
There you go!
...which we already
know how to do...
Yeah.
There you go.
...and cut out
$2 of our profit...
Yep.
...bring it back in?house.
Yep.
...to continue to produce
in the United States.
You say you're gonna build,
in essence, your own facility?
That's correct, Barbara.
