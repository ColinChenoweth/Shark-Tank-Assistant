My name is Tate Koenig.
I'm the Guru of Gouda,
the King of Colby?Jack,
the Bad Boy of Brie,
Master of Mozzarella,
Everybody loves cheese.
I was born in
the diary state.
I'm a Wisconsin??
Oh, I'm well aware.
Tate, look, you know,
congratulations
on what you've done.
The challenge with
Kickstarter?driven sales is,
you don't really have
a lot of customer feedback yet,
not even minimal
customer feedback, right?
Tate, I would have loved to have
customer feedback on this.
No question, all right?
I know you're almost
pre?revenue in the sense
that Kickstarter, to me,
doesn't mean much.
What matters to me
is a long history ??
at least a year worth
of sales ??
'cause I actually think
your price point of $39.95
is $10 too high.
Okay.
It's a $29.95 item.
Yep.
I'm the dairy state
girl over here.
I love cheese.
But I've got to tell you,
this needs some work.
When I was trying to do it,
it did get stuck.
Corcoran: You know what's
great about you, Tate?
What's that?
For every 10 people
who have an idea,
one person maybe eventually
does something with it.
Good luck, Tate. Man,
congrats on what you've done.
?All right.
?Yeah, good luck, Tate.
Keep working,
getting this going.
Have a good day.
Take care, Tate.
Wow.
?Bye.
?Bye?bye.
Koenig: We're taking this
as a little bit of a speed bump.
It definitely sucks,
in the United States,
Canada, China,
dealing with
a United States manufacturer
is just too expensive.
So, what we're gonna use every
dollar of the investment is,
bringing manufacturing
in?house...
There you go!
...which we already
know how to do...
Yeah.
There you go.
Yep.
...to continue to produce
in the United States.
You say you're gonna build,
in essence, your own facility?
That's correct, Barbara.
