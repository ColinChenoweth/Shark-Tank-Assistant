I am Melissa Clayton
from Acton, Massachusetts,
So, Melissa,
tell us about you.
So, when I came up with
the idea for The Matte,
I had already
started another company,
Melissa, I haven't
even bought it,
But congratulations,
Melissa.
Thanks for your time, Mark.
I appreciate it.
No, thank you.
Are you doing
advertising?
Are you doing ??
No advertising at all.
None at all?
Not at all.
Well, then, how did you get
$200,000 in sales?
From word of mouth
Melissa, when I was a kid,
Thanks, Melissa.
Congrats, Melissa.
Clayton: I gave up more equity
to Lori than I had hoped for,
but in the end,
I am just so thrilled
to do a deal with her.
I think it's just
gonna be amazing.
A moment of silence
for $100,000
that just lost its life.
You have no idea.
You don't wear makeup.
