the founder of
billion?dollar jewelry brand
Kendra Scott,
returns to the Tank.
I have over 2,000 women
that work for me.
I'm the Guru of Gouda,
the Master of Mozzarella,
and Sultan of Swiss.
My name is
Anika Goodwin Hilderbrand,
and I live in Greensboro,
North Carolina.
I am the head diva in charge
of OpulenceMD Beauty,
and I am here seeking
$75,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company.
Sharks, don't you love
my eyelashes?
[ Laughter ]
Yes, I love everything.
They're fake.
[ Chuckles ]
And worse, it bothers me
that I'm using harmful chemicals
After years of eyelash abuse
and losing my own lashes
and walking around looking
like a hairless Chihuahua...
[ Laughs ]
...I decided,
"Enough is enough.
There has to be
a better way."
So I created
OpulenceMD Beauty.
It's a luxury beauty brand
specializing in eyelash
extension products
that take the trial,
the error,
and the harmful ingredients
out of the process.
I have created
an eyelash extension
that is noticeably lighter,
more comfortable,
and amazingly easy to apply.
So, Sharks, don't blink on
this opportunity of a lifetime.
Your time to get involved
on this great deal may be short,
but your lashes
should never be.
Wow.
[ Laughs ]
Great pitch.
Thank you.
I have personally chosen
lashes for each of you.
I can't wait
to see mine!
So, I have a video
that will show you
how this is applied.
You first apply
the magnetic liner.
It has tiny
iron oxide particles,
and then, the lash
just pops into place
because of the magnets
on the band.
Wait, wait.
This is the liner?
That's it.
You want to try it?
And so, specifically,
an eyelid specialist.
That's my specialty.
That adds a little bit more
credibility to this story.
and I did not create
magnetic liner and lashes.
Okay.
What I did was
basically build
a better mousetrap.
and all of a sudden, I'd have
a cattywonkus eyelash on my ??
Nope.
Okay.
You can exercise in 'em.
You can nap in them.
Are these reusable?
You brush through the mink's
tail, and that's how the ??
No minks are harmed
in the making of this product.
No minks are harmed.
You're worried
about that?
and lashes, for me, have always
helped me feel more confident.
I went through a period
in my life
where I lost my mom and my dad
39 days apart.
Oh, my gosh.
Greiner: Sorry.
I lost my marriage of 15 years
three months after that.
No.
And I've always
been confident,
but I really struggled
with my confidence
during that time.
And the last year's
helped me a lot,
so I don't want you
to just think of this
as a lash company.
I look at this as a way
for professional women
to own whatever room
they come in
because they are exuding
that much confidence.
So, mink lashes
are the most expensive.
They are.
So, how much
does this cost?
So, the set that you have
would run about $245...
Hello!
Whoa!
...for the entire set.
That's a surprise!
O'Leary: 245 bucks?!
Wow.
I can buy
my own mink for that.
What's your total cost
for this package, to make it?
My total cost for that package
is about $20.
Wow!
My margins are
around 88% to 95%.
But how much
are you selling?
I launched this company
in February.
In that time frame,
my sales are $685,000.
Wow!
In February of this year?
O'Leary: Whoa!
February of this year.
You're crushing it!
That's killing it!
Scott: What?!
And what are you
using as your mode
in which to get
the word out?
Are you on Instagram ads,
Facebook ads?
Yes, I am
paid advertising,
but a lot of education
and community building.
This is not just
selling lashes for me.
This is an opportunity
to tell and help women
learn how to take care
of their eyes
and make better decisions
for their vision.
Corcoran:
Have you made money?
Have you made money?
'Cause your cost's
very high.
I was profitable
as of last month.
Last month,
I did $213,000.
All online.
All online.
Cuban: Hello!
All online.
Your margins are incr??
Scott: And your competition
sells for what?
You're not the first person
to come on "Shark Tank"
with lashes, okay?
I know I'm not.
In other words, you want help
in assembly and distribution?
Right.
I look spectacular.
And I will tell you,
at first, I was like,
"Oh, I've seen this
out here in the market."
I did not think I was
going to be interested
in giving you an offer.
And meeting you,
I'm so impressed.
First of all,
I think that you do
have something
very different
than what I've seen
out there ??
that you have you
and your expertise
and your knowledge
of being a doctor.
Yes.
And that goes
a long way for people,
and creating
these products.
Yes.
I also run a business,
and I have over 2,000 women
that work for me.
My company,
we're over 96% women.
I am on Zoom calls all day
with these fabulous women ??
with my
Kendra Scott family ??
and let me tell you,
they've got their lashes on.
Yes, they do.
They've got
their jewelry on.
We are all neck?up
right now in this world...
Right, right.
This is important.
And this ?? We want to
look good, right?
Yes.
And we want to feel good
about ourselves.
We want to feel good.
And you're right.
Lashes do just kind of like
brighten up the face.
They do.
So, I'm gonna match
his offer at 20%.
As an Army veteran
and a volunteer firefighter,
I invented the Steelhose to
train firefighters to be better.
We began to realize
this was for everyone
who's needing strength,
conditioning,
and who has an everyday mission.
Bring it back and come down.
We put together
an on?demand training platform
that also includes
live training.
It feels incredible
that we have thousands
of new people
that are benefiting
from this new strength training.
We're very excited right now
that we've got FitFighter
online,
so people can get the product
everywhere.
Dick's is a big deal
for Sarah and FitFighter.
It's one of the foremost leaders
in health and wellness,
and now
she's gonna have her product
across hundreds of stores
nationwide.
Aah, I'm so excited!
Apgar:
Through Dick's Sporting Goods
and other retail partners,
both in the product
and in Sarah,
and so we are just really,
really excited
to be in the early innings
of this one.
and that's something
worth fighting for.
A donation of $20,000.
Lubetzky: One of the things
I love about Sarah
is that she likes to give back.
So when she told us that
she was going to donate $10,000
to the Tunnel to Towers
Foundation
benefiting firefighters,
we were very honored
to match it,
and we hope to continue serving
that community
that is always risking
their lives to keep us safe.
and Sultan of Swiss,
aka "Mr. Cheese."
[ Laughter ]
Now, if you love cheese
as much as me,
it's not a question of,
"To cheese, or not to cheese,"
but rather, "What kind of cheese
do you please?"
The block or preprocessed,
sliced or grated?
[ Laughs ]
The block is more affordable
and higher quality,
but we all know
getting that perfect slice ??
it's no easy feat.
And afterwards,
it usually ends up
in some janky plastic bag,
oversized storage container,
or single?use plastic wrap
you throw away after each use.
If you do go with
the preprocessed,
sliced or grated,
it's more convenient, sure,
but it costs way more,
and it comes covered
I've solved all
of these issues and then some
with the Cheese Chopper,
the "great" new way to slice,
[grate]
shred, and store your cheese
with ease.
The Cheese Chopper
comes equipped
with three handle options
to help you "cut the cheese."
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
You have a wire...
I wanted to use that line.
...for your perfect,
thin slices,
the blade to chop right
through your hard cheeses,
and the grater for all
of your shredding desires.
Wow.
Wow.
The cheese
adjustment wheel
gives you perfect
cheese control,
so it doesn't matter if you like
your slices thick or thin ??
you get the perfect slice
every time.
The Cheese Chopper is fun.
It's safe.
If that's not
"Gouda 'nough"...
[ Laughter ]
...the snap?on airtight seal
keeps your cheese fresh
for an "un?Brie?lievably"
long time.
I'm seeking $75,000
for 10% of my company.
So, Sharks, who's ready
to start making some cheddar?
Yeah!
[ Laughter ]
Kendra, unless you have
something "feta" to do,
would you like to come up here
and chop some cheese?
I would love to co??
How did you know
that I like cheese?
Cuban: Who knew you liked ??
Everyone loves cheese!
Come on!
I've been doing
a lot of research.
So I can come up and taste?
I'm so excited.
Yeah, so, if you want to
come over here.
Okay.
That one over there
is for you.
Oh, this side. Okay.
So, it's really simple
and easy to use.
How you do it is,
you pull right here on the side
to remove the lid.
Mm?hmm. Okay.
The second step is,
raise the handle
to the raised position.
And then, it's like
the guillotine.
I just made a nice thick
slice, though, I think.
And then you got
a perfect slice.
Oh, and then it's like
a little escal??
Yep.
Like a little, like,
moving sidewalk.
Yep.
The wheels move it.
And then, so, how to know
how thick or how thin
your slice?
You just kind of
eyeball it on the side?
Yeah, you just eyeball it.
And that was one
of the things we've learned
That's actually
how you swap handles.
So, in the bag,
you've got handles
with a grater, a blade,
and the wire.
Can you tell me how
you came up with the idea?
This came about ??
I was living on the river
with a bunch of buddies,
and we ??
Living on a river.
Oh, man.
It was on
the Willamette River.
We were the poorest people
on the river by tenfold
and had more fun
than everyone else combined.
and we're barbecuing
all the time.
Sunday, we come
clean up the pigsty,
and there'd be half a brick
sitting there,
another quarter in the fridge
that no one put away.
And then, finally,
one afternoon,
we're sitting there
having a margarita.
All of a sudden,
screams from the kitchen.
My friend had
cut her finger...
[ Gasps ]
Corcoran: Oh, boy.
...chopping cheese.
So, we get her
kind of doctored up,
and we're like, "Guys,
there's gotta be a better way."
So, we looked
on the Internet,
and there was
absolutely nothing.
Mm.
So, we went
to the shop ??
to my garage ?? and the first
Cheese Chopper was born.
Greiner: Aww.
I love that.
And then I had
some old modeling clay and stuff
from some old projects we did,
so we put it all together.
and the manufacturing
and whatnot.
I got these three days
before I left for the show.
Scott: Really?
So, talk about
cutting it close.
You don't take ?? You probably
know I'm Chef Wonderful.
we are the only one
that slices, shreds, and stores.
And we actually do have a
pending utility patent on that.
What's the price gonna be
of this product?
So, the retail price
on that is $39.99.
And that's delivered door ??
And the cost to make it?
So, it costs me
$6.65 to make.
By the time you package,
ship it, land it,
we're at $8.30
landed in the warehouse.
Okay, so, when you went
and put this on Kickstarter,
how much did you
try to raise?
So, our goal was $15,000.
And how much did you do?
$100,436.
That's amazing.
Wow!
What do you think
brought all the traffic?
So, we drove a lot of it
with Instagram,
Facebook, social media,
but we also had ??
the Kickstarter community
bought a lot.
Did they?
There was a lot of them.
Yeah, so, we've sold another
25 grand since Kickstarter.
Zero marketing,
zero advertising,
Word of mouth, people just
finding our website.
So, of the $125,000
in sales,
And so,
the challenge there ??
because you have to
deliver en masse,
if one little thing is wrong
or the customer expectation
doesn't match up
with what you deliver,
now, all of a sudden,
that $47,000
or whatever it is
in profit ?? gone.
And not only
is that gone,
and go south very quickly.
And so, for those
reasons, I'm out.
All right.
Sorry to hear that,
but fair enough.
and a cylindrical
shredding device,
but they're really
inexpensive.
You know, the one thing
that it has merit for
that I'll give you is ?? the
storage aspect is interesting.
Right.
The valuation's not crazy.
$750,000.
I just ?? There's not
enough data here for me.
Okay, fair enough,
so just ??
Sorry, I'm out.
Okay, fair enough.
Just to kind of
touch on ??
Scott: You know, look...
And you may need
further testing,
further time to perfect it,
because on Mark's point,
if you don't have
the product right
and you ship it out too soon
and you disappoint
your customer, you've lost.
This product
has to be perfect.
For all of those
reasons, I'm out,
but I congratulate you
on taking that risk,
taking that chance.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Greiner: You know, let me
tell you a little story.
So, aerodynamically,
the bumblebee should not
be able to fly.
Its little wings are too small
for its fat little body,
I know you will work it out,
and so, I wish you good luck,
but, unfortunately,
I'm out.
You saw it,
and the same day,
you turned around
and got it going,
and you actually
turned out a product.
And you raised funding
on Kickstarter.
There's probably
a thousand people
who couldn't do that,
so you've got a great start.
Right.
I think the weakness
to your product,
from my view as a consumer,
is that I love cheese,
and I typically have
four or five
kinds of cheeses
in my fridge.
Right.
And they probably all store
in that kind of space ??
that much space.
So I can't envision myself
using all this space
to store one cheese,
and then having three or four
more in addition to that.
Okay.
And so, it's not a product
that appeals to me,
but that doesn't mean
it wouldn't appeal to everybody.
But I do commend you
how quickly you got it going,
and even though
you might leave here
being a little discouraged
that you didn't get our cash...
Right.
...it's only because
it's too early.
You haven't proved it yet.
But for those reasons,
because you're too early,
I am out.
Okay, fair enough.
and it's kind of a kick
in the you?know?where,
but we're gonna
get through it.
We're gonna keep going
and keep chopping cheese.
Cuban: So, Lori, did we
really have to hear
the bumblebee story?
Don't you like hearing
about the bumblebee?
No, it's a stupid story.
It's not stupid!
Very bad story.
[ Laughter ]
What I wanted
to say was,
"This is never going to work.
It's going to go to zero,
and you've wasted your time."
What stopped you, Kevin?
It's not working.
I'm thinking about my tutor
and saying, "Yes.
Ohm."
Ohm.
Kevin.
Ohm.
Kevin, I'm surprised
you didn't just shred him.
I was going to.
Ohh!
and I am so excited
to be here.
I am coming here today
asking for $100,000
for 20% equity
in my company, The Matte.
and that's disgusting.
And they bounce their makeup
and their brushes
all around the edges
of the sink
because there's
no counter space,
and it's just waiting
for something to fall and break.
Greiner: [ Gasps ]
The entire process
of getting ready
is messy and unorganized
because there's
no counter space.
Well, that is literally
all about to change
with my product, The Matte.
I'm gonna clean this up,
and then I'm gonna show you.
and creates an instant counter.
It can also hold
your hairbrush,
and it lays flat and sturdy.
And The Matte
can hold two pounds
of makeup and product.
The Matte also has
little ridges
so that your makeup
won't fall on the floor
and your brushes
will stay clean.
And, literally,
it will hold everything
that was just all over
that bathroom sink.
See? It's all there.
And then, the best part
about The Matte
is that it folds up
to the size of a tablet
for easy storage
and for travel.
Sharks, The Matte is
an absolute game?changer
for the millions and millions
of women
getting ready in bathrooms
with no counter space.
So, now, who is getting ready
to give me a deal?
and the entire time
I was building that company,
I was always working
on The Matte.
And I'm proud to say that
the other company that I started
is actually what supports
my family now.
What's your other company?
What is your
other company?
So, my other company,
and doesn't need me
the way they used to need me.
This is ?? This is ??
No.
In the last ??
You don't have
all this products!
Kevin ?? "No."
In the last 30 days,
we have sold $20,000 worth
of this product.
What's your total sales,
lifetime?
About $200,000.
And when did you start?
I started ??
Really, that's three years
Okay.
And where are you
selling the product?
So, we do Amazon,
our own website,
and one third?party retailer.
And last year,
we did $85,000 in revenue.
We sell it for $24.99,
and it costs $7 landed.
and I want my money back.
Okay.
[ Laughter ]
It's definitely
a product, I think,
that women understand
better than men.
On this product
and this opportunity,
all I see is a barn...
...so I'm out.
I understand.
Thank you for your time.
Look, this is great.
I have a 17?
and a 14?year?old daughter,
and so, I see it
in their rooms.
I think you're amazing,
but it's just not a fit for me,
so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
and from working
with different influencers.
I think there's
a need for it.
I'm curious as to whether
you have other competition.
There's nothing else like it
out there on the market,
and we have a patent on it.
we had 10 kids
and one bathroom.
Oh, my gosh.
We each had
our own plastic ??
like a cafeteria tray,
and we were not allowed
to go into the bathroom
without our tray.
Wow.
So I don't agree that
you don't have something here.
I think this is a problem.
I think it's well?designed.
But, I mean, it's not
something I find investable.
But I wouldn't want you
to be discouraged.
and very little
counter space in between.
And guess who's
the youngest.
You.
Me, meaning that
I had nothing.
I think I was on the floor
picking out my mascara.
So, this could be something
that would be super cool.
My problem is, though,
is when I saw this,
I thought it was for
a tablet or notebook.
The name "The Matte"
did not at all register with me
at all what you were solving.
I think you're onto something,
but I'm just not there yet,
and for that reason,
unfortunately,
I've gotta say I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate your time.
Lori, I feel like
you and me could
do something amazing
with this product.
I think branding
The Matte and licensing ??
there's a lot
of opportunity there.
and mess and space.
So, women usually
have tons of makeup.
It's all over the place.
You have a small apartment.
I mean, you don't
have a lot of room.
You need another countertop.
So I see opportunity here.
Are you kidding me?
Thank you.
I also see that there's a lot
of work I'm going to have to do.
I'm gonna give you an offer.
So, I'll give you
$100,000,
but I want to be
a 33 1/3% partner.
Lori, I think that
you and I together
would do amazing things
with this product.
I did feel my valuation
was reasonable
with the utility patent
and the skills I bring.
What?
Would you consider 25%?
You know, I love you, Melissa,
and I love your product,
but I think I need to be
a third partner.
I really do, because I need
to get in there.
I need to give you
the muscle and the hustle,
and I want to do it,
and I want to
blow it up for you.
My name
is Harry Levin!
And I'm Michael Sweigart,
inventor of the FurZapper,
the first pet hair remover
for your washer and your dryer.
We are both from New Jersey
and are asking for $600,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
Hello.
Whoa.
Levin: Hello, Sharks!
This is the amazing
FurZapper.
It is the best and only
patented pet hair remover
Pet owners, you have
a huge and hairy problem.
You put your clothes
into the washer,
and they come
out of the dryer...
looking like this ??
still covered in pet hair.
Ugh!
Pet hair, fur,
lint, and dander
sticks to your laundry,
even after you wash it
and dry it many, many times.
Sweigart: We have solved this
problem with the FurZapper,
the world's only
pet hair remover
that works in your washer
and your dryer.
Simply take your FurZappers
and add them into your washer.
dislodges it,
and washes it down the drain.
But there's more ??
in the dryer, FurZapper grabs
any remaining pet hair
and puts it right
into your lint trap,
giving you fur?free laundry
every time.
It's really that good, huh?
That's great.
Honest to God!
I believe you.
[ Laughs ]
And, Sharks, the best
part is this ??
you can reuse FurZapper
over and over and over
and over again.
So, Sharks, with your help,
we'll be zapping the fur
off of pet owners' clothes
around the world.
And as we say...
"Shed happens!"
"Shed happens!"
Okay, guys,
quick question.
When I do my laundry
and I just throw
everything in there ??
You do your own laundry?
Yes, of course.
No, he doesn't.
Yes, of course I do.
When Mark is at home
doing everyone's laundry...
and because it has
holes in it ??
so it allows the holes
to touch the clothing.
And as it touches
the clothing,
since it's made of silicone,
it's tacky initially.
Yeah, I mean, watch.
Like, I was
playing with it.
Yep, it's great.
Look at that.
Okay, how did you
come up with this idea?
So, I've been, like,
a work?at?home dad
So I would do the laundry,
and I'd pull out the laundry,
and the stuff would be dry.
And I'd be folding it,
and it still had pet hair on it.
I accidentally
found the solution.
I had done some work in, like,
the special?effects industry,
more as a hobby.
I had a silicone
zombie mask ??
like, no joke ??
and it was ripped.
And I dropped it
on the floor,
and I noticed that
my dog and cat's hair was on it.
And I said, "Whoa, that's ??
something's going on here."
So I threw it in the washer,
and it was the most effective
thing I'd ever used.
Corcoran: Wow.
That's great.
What a great story.
That is such a good story!
Greiner: Interesting.
So you figured it out
by chance.
Sweigart: Yep.
How did you two meet?
So, Michael and I
were members
of the same business
networking group.
So, I have a keen interest
in animal welfare.
and there was
just a chemistry.
O'Leary:
All right, guys, look,
you're asking
for $600,000 for 10% ??
imputes a $6 million
valuation.
Yes, sir.
How much are you selling?
Well, in our first year,
which was a partial year ??
it was '18 ??
We're already on track.
And where are you
selling it?
Actually,
our first deal was ??
Walmart was actually
our first customer.
?Wow.
?Wow.
And we are in every Walmart
in the entire country.
Every single one?
Dang!
Every one.
That's a
"Shark Tank" first.
Wow!
And our margins
on our two?pack ??
which is our top seller ??
This one.
Yeah, that's
the majority. Yep.
Okay.
That's right. 71%.
Yep.
What?!
What does the
two?pack sell for?
What's the retail?
Levin: $14.99.
Wow.
And I want you
to know this ??
our acquisition cost ??
you sittin' down? ??
ha?ha ?? a nickel!
Wow!
It costs a nickel
to sell a product.
Fantastic.
We've been on QVC.
Yeah, what happened
when you were on QVC?
Well, you know what?
We got on QVC.
They showed us, Lori,
at 3:00 in the morning.
Yeah.
'Cause you weren't
with me, Harry.
Well, that's what
I'm saying!
Cuban: So, guys, what are you
gonna use the money for?
Okay,
love that question.
What we're doing is ??
Our biggest challenge
has been the fact
that we have had
to outsource manufacturing.
Although we have patents
and all
the European Union countries,
...and cut out
$2 of our profit...
Yep.
...bring it back in?house.
...and it allows us
to be able...
And I'm in the cat
business ?? Basepaws.
We do cat DNA testing,
and I have all their names,
e?mail addresses, et cetera.
I'd love to sell this
direct to those customers, okay?
I'm gonna make
a two?part offer to you
so you can choose
which way you want to go.
This business is so successful
in terms of free cash flow
that it can support debt,
so I'll offer you $600,000
for debt for three years
at 9.5%,
and I'll only take 5% equity
in that scenario, okay?
And then,
if you want to go equity,
I'll do the $600,000
for 20%.
Then, I go to work
expanding what you're doing
direct to customer.
That, to me,
is far more interesting,
because the margins
are obscene.
There's an offer
to put some fur on.
Anybody else, please?
Corcoran: Well, I'm curious
what you think about that offer.
It's a brilliant offer.
There's no two ways
about it.
That's 'cause
I'm Mr. Wonderful.
Not so brilliant, Harry.
Levin:
And you know what?
Today, you have underscored
your reputation.
I think I could take your sales
to the moon and back,
much like I have done
with Comfy.
and I happen to think
you should be doing it, too.
Yeah.
You're, like,
made for TV.
I'd like to give you
$600,000 for 20%.
Thank you.
Scott: You know what?
I have fallen in love
with you both,
but as I'm sitting here
in the Tank today ??
Look, there are things
that I'm great at,
but some of these Sharks
have access to give you things
that I could not.
I'm going to pass
because I know
it's better for you,
but if one of these Sharks
let me in a little bit,
I sure as heck
would like to invest.
But for that reason,
I'm out.
I think that you've got
great options here,
so listen to them all.
I respect that. Yeah.
Okay, do you know that,
every single year,
I bring my same pad?
and written one thing.
I wrote,
"This is <i>so</i> right for me."
Michael and Harry have
two offers on the table
for their laundry pet hair
remover, FurZapper,
but Lori
is also interested.
Greiner:
Wait a minute.
Do you know that,
every single year,
I bring my same pad?
and written one thing.
I wrote,
"This is <i>so</i> right for me."
Lori, that's funny.
I wrote, "It's better for me."
I ??
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: No, this is
so right for me.
I mean, it's in my bones,
right?
So, I would give you
the $600,000.
And I want you to feel good,
so I'm going to give it
for 19.99%.
?Ohh!
?Whoa!
Cuban: Whoa!
God.
19.99%.
Oh, my God.
No, Harry.
Wait a sec.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Harry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
$600,000 for 15%.
Harry.
Wait a sec.
Harry.
Lori.
Lori, let him
make an offer.
Michael.
No, we need to.
I'm listening.
Lori, listen, listen.
We need to do this
together, Harry.
You ?? you're the queen,
and I'm not blowing smoke
at you,
but I've gotta
talk to Mark.
No, don't talk
to Mark, Harry.
Lori ??
Don't talk to Mark, Harry.
Do you want to match
his offer, Lori, or not?
You need me. You want me.
Do you want to match
his 15%?
If I walk out of this ??
If I walk out of here
and I don't talk to this man,
my wife
is going to cut me off.
[ Laughing ]
All right?
So I gotta talk to Mark.
Yeah, but do you want me
as your partner?
$600,000 ??
Let him talk to Mark!
Lori, relax.
$600,000, 15%.
We do. We do.
Will you jump in
with him?
I won't jump in with him,
but I'll match it, Harry.
I'll give you $600,000...
Oh, wow.
Oh, it's getting
intense in here.
...for 15%,
but you have to pick me.
I'm the right partner for you,
and if you don't know that...
No, no, no, no, no ??
I'm going to blow you up
internationally,
you can just
hit the ground running and race.
Okay, guys,
Mark and Lori at 15%,
Barbara and I at 20%
on the equity.
and I'm gonna give you
another $600,000 credit line.
with the understanding that
you're going to have to provide
some additional finance
if we need it...
we're okay.
Good!
Lori, you have a deal!
Lori, you have a deal!
Yeah, whoo!
Cuban: There you go.
Whoop?whoop?whoop!
15%! Hey!
Thank you.
I am so glad!
and I've fallen in love
with her,
and I respect
everything she does.
So making a deal with her ??
other than getting married,
the birth of my children
and my grandchildren ??
this is, without a doubt,
the best day of my life.
