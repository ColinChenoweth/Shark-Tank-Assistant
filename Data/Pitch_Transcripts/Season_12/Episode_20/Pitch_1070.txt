My name
is Harry Levin!
And I'm Michael Sweigart,
inventor of the FurZapper,
the first pet hair remover
for your washer and your dryer.
We are both from New Jersey
and are asking for $600,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
Hello.
Whoa.
Levin: Hello, Sharks!
This is the amazing
FurZapper.
It is the best and only
patented pet hair remover
Sweigart: We have solved this
problem with the FurZapper,
the world's only
pet hair remover
that works in your washer
and your dryer.
So you figured it out
by chance.
Sweigart: Yep.
How did you two meet?
So, Michael and I
were members
of the same business
networking group.
So, I have a keen interest
in animal welfare.
What's the retail?
Levin: $14.99.
Wow.
And I want you
to know this ??
our acquisition cost ??
you sittin' down? ??
ha?ha ?? a nickel!
Wow!
It costs a nickel
to sell a product.
Fantastic.
We've been on QVC.
Yeah, what happened
when you were on QVC?
Well, you know what?
We got on QVC.
They showed us, Lori,
at 3:00 in the morning.
Yeah.
'Cause you weren't
with me, Harry.
Well, that's what
I'm saying!
Cuban: So, guys, what are you
gonna use the money for?
Okay,
love that question.
What we're doing is ??
Our biggest challenge
has been the fact
that we have had
to outsource manufacturing.
Although we have patents
Not so brilliant, Harry.
Levin:
And you know what?
Today, you have underscored
your reputation.
Michael and Harry have
two offers on the table
for their laundry pet hair
remover, FurZapper,
but Lori
is also interested.
Greiner:
Wait a minute.
Do you know that,
every single year,
I bring my same pad?
No, Harry.
Wait a sec.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Harry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
$600,000 for 15%.
Harry.
Wait a sec.
Harry.
Lori.
Lori, let him
make an offer.
Michael.
No, we need to.
I'm listening.
Lori, listen, listen.
We need to do this
together, Harry.
You ?? you're the queen,
and I'm not blowing smoke
at you,
but I've gotta
talk to Mark.
No, don't talk
to Mark, Harry.
Lori ??
Don't talk to Mark, Harry.
Do you want to match
his offer, Lori, or not?
You need me. You want me.
Do you want to match
his 15%?
If I walk out of this ??
If I walk out of here
and I don't talk to this man,
my wife
is going to cut me off.
[ Laughing ]
All right?
So I gotta talk to Mark.
Yeah, but do you want me
as your partner?
$600,000 ??
Let him talk to Mark!
Lori, relax.
$600,000, 15%.
We do. We do.
Will you jump in
with him?
I won't jump in with him,
but I'll match it, Harry.
I'll give you $600,000...
Oh, wow.
Oh, it's getting
intense in here.
...for 15%,
but you have to pick me.
I'm the right partner for you,
and if you don't know that...
No, no, no, no, no ??
I'm going to blow you up
internationally,
