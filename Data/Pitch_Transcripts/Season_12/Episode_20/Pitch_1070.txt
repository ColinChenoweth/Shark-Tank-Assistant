I am Melissa Clayton
from Acton, Massachusetts,
and I am so excited
to be here.
I am coming here today
asking for $100,000
for 20% equity
in my company, The Matte.
So, Melissa,
tell us about you.
So, when I came up with
the idea for The Matte,
I had already
started another company,
and the entire time
I was building that company,
I was always working
on The Matte.
And I'm proud to say that
the other company that I started
is actually what supports
my family now.
What's your other company?
What is your
other company?
So, my other company,
Melissa, I haven't
even bought it,
and I want my money back.
Okay.

It's definitely
a product, I think,
that women understand
better than men.
On this product
and this opportunity,
all I see is a barn...
...so I'm out.
I understand.
Thank you for your time.
Look, this is great.
I have a 17?
and a 14?year?old daughter,
But congratulations,
Melissa.
Thanks for your time, Mark.
I appreciate it.
No, thank you.
Are you doing
advertising?
Are you doing ??
No advertising at all.
None at all?
Not at all.
Well, then, how did you get
$200,000 in sales?
From word of mouth
Melissa, when I was a kid,
we had 10 kids
and one bathroom.
Oh, my gosh.
We each had
our own plastic ??
like a cafeteria tray,
and we were not allowed
to go into the bathroom
without our tray.
Wow.
So I don't agree that
you don't have something here.
I think this is a problem.
I think it's well?designed.
But, I mean, it's not
something I find investable.
But I wouldn't want you
to be discouraged.
You know, I love you, Melissa,
and I love your product,
but I think I need to be
a third partner.
I really do, because I need
to get in there.
I need to give you
the muscle and the hustle,
and I want to do it,
and I want to
blow it up for you.
Thanks, Melissa.
Congrats, Melissa.
Clayton: I gave up more equity
to Lori than I had hoped for,
but in the end,
I am just so thrilled
to do a deal with her.
I think it's just
gonna be amazing.
A moment of silence
for $100,000
that just lost its life.
You have no idea.
You don't wear makeup.
