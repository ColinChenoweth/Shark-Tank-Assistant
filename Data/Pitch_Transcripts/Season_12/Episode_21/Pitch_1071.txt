Hello, Sharks.
My name is Jason.
And my name is Tyler,
and we are...
Truffle Shuffle!
Truffle Shuffle!
We are here today
seeking $500,000
for 5% of our business.
?Hello.
?Whoa.
We're two chefs that met
while working
at a three?Michelin?star
restaurant.
We were directly in charge
of sourcing the finest
and most expensive ingredients
on the menu,
especially the truffles,
the black gold of ingredients,
so prized, there's been
a black market that's developed.
We learned that you have to work
directly with truffle hunters.
Otherwise, you could be
paying top dollar for fakes.
We started this company
to help chefs and consumers
source honest truffles
and create our own line
of truffle products.
But what do you do
when a global pandemic hits
and you have...
20 pounds of fresh truffles
on hand
worth $1,000 a pound
and very perishable?
And every restaurant
that you work with is closed?
You adapt.
We decided to sell our truffles
direct to consumer
and launched
a live cooking experience.
We built a website
where guests go on,
select a dish that they
want to learn how to make,
and then we send them
all of the ingredients
for them to make a
Michelin?quality meal at home.
Wow.
We would love
to show you Sharks
how these live
cooking experiences work.
[ Laughs ]
Lights.
Camera.
Action!
Action!
Welcome to
the Truffle Shuffle show.
We've got some of our
top supporters here today
to help give us
a hand with this demo.
What up, guys?
We're gonna do
our crepe suzette today,
which is one
of our favorite classes.
We're gonna
flambé the sauce,
so be careful
with this one, guys.
Tyler is
a trained expert here.
Whoa!
Oh, yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Awesome, guys.
Now, Sharks,
it's feeding time.
?Yeah.
?Yeah!
So go ahead, lift those boxes
straight up
and check out
those dishes.
?Oh, wow.
?Check it out.
?Nice.
?Wow.
We have our black truffle
tortellini en brodo.
?Ooh.
?So if you want, go ahead.
Bust open
that truffle salt.
Truffle salt.
Take a smell
and get some seasoning on
from up high.
Oh, my ?? Oh.
Unbelievable.
Check that out.
?Ooh, that smells so good.
?So good.
Yeah, that's nice.
Grab that truffle.
And just like Jason's doing
here, shave some truffles.
Is this $1,000 a pound?
White truffles actually
go up to $5,000 a pound.
?What?
?Yeah.
Listen, you know you are talking
to Chef Wonderful here.
?Absolutely.
?I am one with the truffle.
[ Laughs ]
You're one with the potato.
[ Laughter ]
As trained chefs,
we know that a Shark
is a key ingredient
for our recipe for success.
So, Sharks, who wants to feast
on this investment?
So how did you
come up with this?
So, myself and Tyler
are actually chefs.
We met at one of the top
restaurants in the world.
?Where?
?Which one?
French Laundry.
Oh, I've been there.
It's great.
That's the only <i>guide Michélin</i>
in America, right?
Yep,
and we were crazy enough
to think if we started
a truffle business
that we could sell
enough truffles
to one day make enough money
to open up our own restaurant.
We took 9,999 euros,
strapped it to my buddy's chest,
sent him to Europe,
and he started
making relationships
directly with
truffle hunters.
And we started just hustling
every single day,
door to door
selling truffles.
But then in 2019, we knew in
order to scale this business,
we had to launch
a truffle product line...
Yep.
...because we needed
something shelf?stable.
So Jason and his wife actually
went on their honeymoon to Bali,
and they met
this salt maker
that makes this beautiful,
handcrafted sea salt.
And I had been messing around
with this truffle powder.
So when we mixed the truffle
powder with the salt,
we knew that we had
a good product on our hands.
And what do you sell it for?
What did it cost you?
So we sell it
for $20 a jar.
It costs us $2.80.
?Yeah.
?Wow.
?Nice.
O'Leary:
What are your sales?
'Cause you've imputed a value
of $10 million on this business.
So year one, just hustling
fresh truffles ?? $65,000.
Year two ?? $486,000.
What?
And when COVID?19 hit,
every restaurant
we worked with was closed,
and we had 20 pounds
of fresh truffles on hand.
And they have a shelf life
of five days.
?Five days?
?What?
?Yes.
?Yep.
?Oh, my God.
?You're kidding.
Otherwise,
the aroma dissipates.
?So what did you do?
?Oh.
So all the money we had
was in these truffles.
Truffles hit Tuesday.
Wednesday,
we get a phone call
from one of the top
private clubs in the world,
and they want to know if we'll
do a virtual cooking class
for their members.
We basically take the phone call
while looking at the truffles,
and we're like,
"Well, what if we send
all the ingredients needed
to make truffle risotto
and we'll even see
if we can find some truffles?"
And they're like, "Wow.
Would you really do that?"
[ Laughter ]
Smart man.
We said, "I think we could
figure that out."
They sent an e?mail out about
this virtual cooking class
that we're gonna do.
And by noon that day,
we had completely sold out
of all the truffles.
Since then, this year, we've
done $1.4 million in sales.
?Wow.
?Hell, yes!
?Whoo.
?Hell, yes!
Yep.
So all of that $1.4 million
is the kit,
which includes
various ingredients.
So about 84% of that is
the cooking?class experiences.
But the cooking?class experience
I buy through buying a kit.
Exactly, yes.
O'Leary: What do you charge
for the typical class?
What are the cost of goods?
How much do you make?
We charge $95
to $125 per kit,
and then our
gross profit margin is 60%.
Greiner:
So there's the classes.
And then on this hand, you've
got salt, honey, and popcorn.
Where's your strong focus?
Because there's two things.
I'm not saying
you can't do them both.
But how do you
see this going?
We look at ourselves
as a full brand,
so we put those truffle products
into our kits
and teach people recipes using
our truffle products.
But, guys, the challenge
is your cash flow, right?
Because some things
don't seem to add up.
So you did how much
year to date?
Year to date would've been
$1.4 million.
$1.4 million.
And what's your profit?
So off of that $1.4 million,
we've netted $8,000.
$8,000, okay.
Therein lies the rub.
$8,000 on $1.4 million?
Right, okay, and so how much
cash do you have in the bank?
We have $165,000.
Okay, so, you guys, you see
your challenge here, right?
Because you're caught
between two businesses.
In one business, you're
very inventory?heavy, right,
which is
your various products.
So what have you sold
this year?
We've done about $212,000
in sales
with the truffle products.
And you're selling those
into retail via wholesaler?
Yes.
Right now we're working
with Whole Foods,
launching
with Whole Foods.
Mm?hmm. Yep.
Okay, so you're not charging
enough for your live classes,
'cause you're getting
crushed on them.
Yes.
We do a class that will cost $95
for that kit.
We send that to the guest.
We will make $60.
Then why are you
only making $8,000?
Where's the other
expense coming in?
So last month,
we did $347,000.
Off of that,
we made $50,000.
So last month was
our break?even point.
O'Leary:
That's really skinny margins.
I mean, you should
be making 20%.
Bottom line, you sell
$1 million, you make $200,000.
That's what
it should look like.
Or, even simpler,
where's the cash going?
So we've grown
this business
off of the profits
generated from the business.
Yes.
Greiner:
I'm gonna just jump in.
I'm close
to my entrepreneurs.
I've watched them
go through COVID.
We've had to be very creative
to grow their business
or thrive or pivot.
This is one of the smartest
changes I have heard of.
But as a business,
as an investment,
I can't see what I would
bring to the table.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you so much, Lori.
John:
Yeah, as I look at you guys,
you guys look very young to be
so accomplished in that field.
You guys are like scientists
when you're doing your thing.
So I can see this virtual course
taking off.
But a $10 million valuation,
I just can't take
the ride with you.
So I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
Cuban: Yeah, guys.
It's gonna take you
far more capital
than you're anticipating.
And 'cause you're doing
multiple businesses,
it's gonna take
so much of your time
that it's gonna
be very difficult
to pull all
those pieces together.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Mark, so the way that we've been
able to grow this business
is when we sell these classes,
we get that money in the bank.
Herjavec:
Guys, I've heard enough.
You've got magic
going on, baby.
And the magic is
in these classes.
People are looking
for experiences.
Yeah.
You should sell a little thing
where you unlock a class.
Pre?record
a bunch of classes.
Spend 10 hours a day,
record them.
Send me a key.
I unlock a lasagna class.
Our goal is to be
the Peloton of cooking.
?[ Laughs ]
?Yes!
That's exactly
what went through my head.
I'll give you the $500,000
for 20%.
Thank you, Robert.
Would it be okay if we heard
any of the other offers?
There are no other offers.
Wait a second.
Jason and Tyler have an offer
on the table from Robert
for their truffle?based cooking
and product company,
Truffle Shuffle.
But Kevin may also
be interested.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
But you guys
really need some discipline.
I don't think you're worth
$10 million right now
'cause it's kind of
throwing stuff at the wall.
And I agree you should do that
in a digital pivot
to figure out what works.
I would give you the $500,000
as debt,
9.5%, three years.
I would take 25% equity.
I would focus on truffle product
in my channel.
Ugh. No.
Herjavec: So hang on.
Look, Kevin does
a lot of stuff well.
But he's not an operator.
You've got a real
experience business here.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm the only chef up here
besides these two guys.
That's exactly my point.
He doesn't even see
what the business is.
It's a studio.
I see exactly
what the business ??
Robert has no equity
in the food industry ?? zero.
Nobody knows who he is
in the food industry.
I am Chef Wonderful.
I am well?known.
Again, it goes
to Kevin's ignorance
of what the value
of your business is.
It's not
a freakin' food business.
No, I'm very ??
I'm very eloquent on the value.
It's an experience
business...
McKinney: Yeah, it's a
virtual?experience business.
...based on your background.
You, for a moment, allow <i>me</i>
to be a major chef.
That's what people
are buying.
Robert, is there any way that
you would do a deal with Mark?
Why do I need Mark?
What am I, chopped mushroom?
I could come back in.
Alright, guys, make us
an offer for Mark and I.
Okay, give us one second
to think about it.
Sure.
We'd love
to make an offer here.
[ Whispers indistinctly ]
Would you guys do $250,000 each
for 7% each?
14%. No, it's just not enough,
because most likely,
if you keep on growing
at that speed,
you're gonna need more cash.
Mark's right.
It's a lot of work.
$500,000 for 14%,
and then to split it?
It's just not enough.
I actually think 20%
was relatively generous.
I got to stick at 20%.
I'd love to do a deal with Mark.
I love to do a deal on my own.
Then I'll do the same thing.
I'll offer you $500,000
for the 20%.
We'll let you pick.
Would you do that
for 15%?
I'd do it for 18%.
Would you do it
for 17%?
18%.
Would you go up
on the cash?
Okay, $501,000.
[ Laughter ]
Either you want me
or you don't, guys.
