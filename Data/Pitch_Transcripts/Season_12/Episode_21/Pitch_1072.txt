Hi, Sharks.
I'm Cindy Trevizo.
And I'm Gabe Trevizo.
We are from
Gilbert, Arizona.
And we're seeking
$200,000
for 10% equity
in our company, Suds2Go.
As parents, we know taking
adorable little ones outside
and keeping their hands clean,
it's impossible.
But how do we clean
their germy little hands?
Sanitizer?
It stings.
Wipes?
They're always dried out.
And we definitely
don't want to take them
in the nasty
public restroom.
The best way to clean
their hands
is with doctor?preferred
soap and water.
That's why we created
Suds2Go,
a revolutionary, portable,
and patented handwashing system
that allows you to bring
real handwash anywhere you go.
Both:
No sink, no problem.
In our reusable
bottle version,
simply fill this container
with water
and this section
with your favorite foaming soap.
Pump the soap.
And pour to rinse.
It's really that easy.
Clever.
We also have
a second version
that's so tiny,
it can even fit in your pocket.
And it press?fits onto
a disposable water bottle.
In these times, more than ever,
we can have the peace of mind
knowing we're using the best,
most effective way
to get germs
off our hands.
Now, Sharks,
who's ready to join us
in the hand?hygiene
revolution?
Because remember,
with Suds2Go...
Both:
No sink, no problem.
Cindy, how does the portable
little one work?
Can you show us that?
This one, yes.
It just presses on.
And then...
pumps soap, and then this one
is a little bit more ??
Oh, I see.
John: Oh, but that's cool.
That really is smart.
Herjavec:
How much soap does it hold?
So that holds
about 30 pumps.
So this is
our disposable product,
and these are made
to fit
directly onto any
disposable water bottle.
How much is
the disposable one?
Those sell in a two?pack
for $10.99.
?Ooh.
?Wow.
?That's not cheap.
?That's expensive.
?That's a lot.
?What's your cost on them?
$2.25, landed, packaged.
That's good.
And what's your cost
on this?
And what do you sell it for
again?
Landed, that's $7,
and packaged.
And we sell it
for $36.99.
Ooh, that's not cheap,
either.
Tell us how you're
selling it today.
We're selling only on
our website since February 1st.
?What good timing.
?You're just around COVID.
Greiner: I mean,
that was accidental, right?
It was accidental.
We ran a Kickstarter
in '18
to kind of gauge
social proof for ourselves.
We raised our $12,500,
which was our target.
And we got our inventory
in December of '19.
Wow.
So we got
our first 4,000 bottles.
So how are sales going?
Those 4,000 bottles,
how many did you sell?
They're gone.
They lasted six weeks.
Six weeks.
?Six weeks? You sold out?
?Good for you.
Greiner: Wow.
And we have 12,000 more coming
at the end of the month.
What are your
total sales so far?
Lifetime sales ??
$392,000.
Wow.
Tell me about you.
What's both your history?
So our history
is interesting.
We're eighth?grade
sweethearts.
Oh.
We've been through
a lot together.
In '08, I lost my job.
Cindy was a teacher.
And...Ah.
So she picked up extra jobs
on the weekend as a waitress.
And I basically did
whatever I could,
which included valeting cars,
landscaping,
portering,
which is picking up trash.
And it was ??
Sorry.
It was a defining moment
for us,
and it really lit a fire in
our bellies to be hard workers,
to not let things get in the way
of where we want to go.
Herjavec: You know, Gabe,
it's interesting.
You know, "Shark Tank"
started in 2008.
And I think one of the reasons
our show lasted
is we inspired so many people
in the midst of all that misery
and hardship.
And here we are.
And we're in
a global pandemic.
And I hope we do
the same thing again.
Where did you get the money
to do manufacturing?
Was it all
from Kickstarter?
No.
It was our money.
So we've put in about $80,000
of our own money.
?Wow.
?$80,000?
Herjavec: Gabe, where did
you get the $80,000?
Our bank account.
Our bank account.
We save money.
?Good for you.
?So those were all your savings?
Sure.
You're all?in here, right?
You basically wiped out your
savings to get to where you are.
It means everything to us.
I mean, it's our dream.
How much cash do you have
in the bank now?
In the business account,
we have $90,000.
?Wow, good for you.
?Wow.
And we also have about $120,000
of paid inventory,
which is a retail value
of $600,000.
Cuban: See, I mean,
that's just incredible.
Think about that.
Literally, since February,
you went from, "Oh, no,"
to, "Oh, yes."
Yeah.
That's incredible.
Incredible.
And what do you need
the money for today?
We need the money
to fast?pace
entering global markets
with distribution,
and obviously inventory's
gonna cost a lot of money.
Do you have any debt
on your business right now?
We have no debt
on the business.
We do have a personal loan that
we've drawn solely for Suds2Go.
How big is it?
$150,000.
Oh!
$150,000?
Greiner:
So you've put in $80,000.
That was all our modes.
That was our engineer designs.
That was the first run
of inventory.
And you have a patent, I see,
which isn't cheap, right?
I loved the story so much more
before the $150,000.
And the patent.
Greiner:
Is that a utility patent?
It's a utility patent
for both products.
So can anybody else
add a pump dispense?
No, absolutely not.
The money's gonna be used
for hopefully entering
other markets, okay?
If we can find
distribution possibilities
in other countries, this is
a product that'll just explode.
Gabe and Cindy, I have good news
and I have bad news.
Good news is, I have a product
like this called Blueland.
That business was a retail
business until COVID hit.
Now it's doing $3 million
a month online direct.
It's way beyond
anybody's expectations,
and they're expanding
their product line wildly.
I can't invest in you.
That's a direct competitor
to what I'm doing.
I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you, Kevin.
We appreciate ??
Cuban: You guys, look.
I think what you have
accomplished is incredible.
The challenge for me
is that while it's very timely,
I've just seen so many people
trying to get into
the same space.
You know, you may be able
to patent it for this look.
But there are a variety
of different ways
to maybe accomplish
the same thing.
But it's gonna be a challenge
as an investor.
I just don't know the path
that I can take you on.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
But congratulations.
Thank you so much, Mark.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Herjavec: I think there's
gonna be a lot of people
in this space very quickly.
And it could crush you,
and I'm not trying
to be negative,
but it's staying
ahead of that.
Right.
I'm out.
John: I'm interested
in this business,
and I can help you
with the distribution.
I'll make you an offer.
Usually there'd be
three of us
and I'd want to go in a third,
a third, and a third.
But because I think that,
first of all,
a teacher is one
of the country's
most underappreciated
commodities,
I'm willing to go in
for $200,000 for 22.5%.
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Greiner:
You know, I think Daymond
has a good offer
on the table for you.
I'm out.
Daymond,
would you do it for 20%?
I can't take it anymore.
I mean, I've been at the bottom.
I know what it takes
to come back up.
I think you guys are the ones
to take it through this.
That's a crazy offer.
You shouldn't give up 20%
or 22% of your business.
I will give you $200,000
for 15%.
Heck, if I can sell
$100 million...
Cuban: Here comes Robert
to the rescue!
...of inappropriate
ugly Christmas sweaters,
we can sell $100 million
of this.
Heck, yeah.
Yes.
$200,000, 15%.
