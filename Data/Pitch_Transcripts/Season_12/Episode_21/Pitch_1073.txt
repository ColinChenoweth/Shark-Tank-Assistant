Hello, Sharks.
My name is Jill Visit.
Jill, is there any recommended
time that I got to do this for?
It only takes
a couple of seconds.
45 minutes.
Yee?haw! Yee?haw!
Where did this inspiration
come from?
I'm a working mom.
I like to make healthy meals
for my kids.
What I would do,
because I really don't
like my salad spinner,
And what's it cost you
to make, Jill?
Cuban: When it comes
to Salad Sling, Jill,
you had as much money
as you had,
you kind of went for
the inventory you could afford,
?Thank you, Jill.
?Congratulations, Jill.
?Thank you, Jill.
?Yeah, thanks a lot. Bye.
?Thank you, Jill.
?Good luck.
