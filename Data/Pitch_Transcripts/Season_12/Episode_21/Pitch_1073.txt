Hello, Sharks.
My name is Jill Visit.
And I'm from Austin, Texas.
I'm here seeking $100,000
for 20% of my company,
the Salad Sling.
The Salad Sling is the world's
best greens?drying device.
We all want to be healthy
and eat more veggies.
But until now, the only option
has been my nemesis,
my old salad spinner.
This thing is huge,
and it's a pain to wash.
Every time I want to use it,
I got to grab it off
the top shelf
and then wash all these pieces.
For a busy working mom
just trying to make
a quick, healthy meal,
that just does not work.
So I invented a better way.
And I call it the Salad Sling.
This funny?looking towel
dries wet greens in seconds.
Simply place your wet greens,
lettuce, or herbs in the center,
gather up the handles,
and sling it.
[ Laughter ]
Whoo!
The centrifugal force
of the spinning
pulls the moisture
from the greens,
and the super?absorbent
microfiber soaks up the excess.
No.
Oh, my God.
There's also a waterproof
liner in the center
that keeps all that water from
flying all over your kitchen.
Best of all, when you're done,
simply flip it over
and use it again,
hang it up to dry, or toss it
in the washing machine.
And no more reaching
for the top shelf.
The Salad Sling is compact
and easy to store anywhere.
So who's ready to help me
take the hassle
out of prepping healthy meals?
And now you guys each
have a sample.
I would love for you to show off
your slinging style, as well.
So just open it up.
Just toss it in there.
Like the whole thing?
Yep.
That's all you got to do.
This is right, right?
Yes, absolutely.
I feel like I'm gonna
lassoo something.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Side to side.
Whoo!
?Oh, my God. Wait.
?Flying.
Well, you got to hold it tight
at the top.
Yeah, you got to
hold yours together.
Got to hold on tight.
There you go.
There you go.
?Yep, you got your figure eight.
?Yeah.
You can do the side.
Cuban: See, in the old days,
we'd be battling it out.
I'd be smacking you across
the head with this thing.
Jill, is there any recommended
time that I got to do this for?
It only takes
a couple of seconds.
45 minutes.
Yee?haw! Yee?haw!
Where did this inspiration
come from?
I'm a working mom.
I like to make healthy meals
for my kids.
What I would do,
because I really don't
like my salad spinner,
is I would use a dish towel
and sling it around.
And it made a huge mess
all over my kitchen.
And my family
thought I was nuts,
and I was just like,
"Wow, there's an idea here."
How much does it cost?
They retail for $19.99.
And what's it cost you
to make, Jill?
Right now it costs me ??
Landed price is $7.58.
What are your total revenues,
and how do you sell it?
I've been selling
since February of 2019.
I sold 2,200 of them last year,
400 this year.
2,200 last year?
Yes.
Pretty good.
Wow. Okay.
So total revenue ?? total sales
right now is $49,000.
Wait a second.
$49,000.
2,200 down to 400
is not good news.
Wow.
Okay, yes.
That's bad.
So what happened was, we got a
ton of great press in the fall.
When the NPR story hit
two weeks before Christmas,
it went bananas,
and I sold through
almost all of my inventory,
and then COVID
shut down my factory.
And so they were on back order
for months and months.
So you have the demand.
You just haven't had the product
to fulfill it.
Yes, I didn't get my next order
until July 9th.
Wow.
You've got all this PR
that's been driving your sales.
Yes.
How are you going to sell it
once the PR is over?
So I'm now trying to get
some e?mail campaigns going
and social media.
How much money
have you put into it?
So far, of my own money,
$60,000.
But I don't owe anybody.
I don't have any debt
other than to myself.
So what are you gonna
use the money for?
I've got to get rid
of these inventory issues
because that's killing me.
Every time we get a good story
or something happens, boom,
I'm out of inventory.
And so I want to have
more inventory on hand.
Bottom line is, you sold
$50,000 worth of product.
I do ??
I'm underwhelmed.
Okay.
Sorry.
I'm just underwhelmed.
At the end of the day,
I look at it and say to myself,
it's been in the market
and it has underwhelmed.
This is not the product
that's gonna set you free.
It just isn't.
And sometimes entrepreneurs
spend a long time
on something they love a lot
because it was their idea
when really what they
should be doing
is taking it behind the barn
and shooting it.
Cuban: Hell, no!
That is so stupid, Kevin.
And I think this product
deserves that category.
No!
It's a barn burner. Sorry.
No.
In the wrong way.
No.
Look, I'm sorry, Mark.
I'm sorry.
No.
You have to tell
the truth sometimes.
That's why I'm here.
The minute you find the truth,
you can tell it.
No, this is the truth.
This product is gonna be
brutal to sell, very brutal.
To displace what already exists
that works so well ??
very hard to do.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay.
John:
In regards to the product,
I know that I'm the kind
of person that buys it once,
tries it once,
and then doesn't do it,
so it's just me
being that consumer...
Okay.
...that causes
that little roadblock for me.
So I wish you luck,
but I'm out.
Okay. Okay, thank you.
I know a lot of people really do
like it and use it repeatedly.
My concern is, unless you expand
into other products,
it's a $19.99
trivial kind of product.
I don't mean that in a mean way,
but I think it's a gift.
There's nothing wrong
with a side hustle.
That's how I see it.
It's not a business
I would invest in.
I'm out.
Okay. Okay.
Cuban: When it comes
to Salad Sling, Jill,
you had as much money
as you had,
you kind of went for
the inventory you could afford,
you busted your butt
to go out and get PR
that sold through
your inventory,
which is perfect,
the exact way to do it.
But you didn't tell me
how you're gonna sell it
without PR, right?
You haven't said, "I know
exactly what I'm doing."
So I don't see a path
where I could
just take this product
and run with it.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Okay.
I'm that person where, like,
I wrap it up in paper towels
so that every piece is,
like, kind of getting dry.
Uh?huh.
And so I was a bit
on the fence here about this.
You know, how many people
would really do this
versus spinning
or rolling?
Yeah.
And I think that you'll probably
have a decent market
but I think a market,
you know, good for you
but not for a partner,
too.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay, thank you all for
your time and your feedback.
?Thank you, Jill.
?Congratulations, Jill.
?Thank you, Jill.
?Yeah, thanks a lot. Bye.
?Thank you, Jill.
?Good luck.
The Sharks didn't really seem
to understand
the need for the Salad Sling,
but they're just 100% wrong.
And so I'm gonna keep on going.
And I know America
wants to clean out
those kitchen cabinets,
and we're gonna be there.
