Hey, Sharks,
my name is Justin Wang.
I'm here today
to ask for $500,000
for 1% of my company, LARQ.
[ Laughter ]
Have you ever noticed
that funky smell
coming from your
reusable water bottle?
I bet you have.
Oh, man.
And if you're
like most people,
you do what we call
the sniff test.
[ Sniffs ]
Whoo?whee.
The average
reusable water bottle
contains more bacteria colony
than your dog bowl
or toilet seat.
No wonder they stink.
And it's no wonder
it's so tempting
to reach for a single?use
plastic water bottle.
The result ??
over one million of these guys
are consumed
every single minute.
And that's no good
for your health
and even worse
for the environment.
That's why we invented
the LARQ Bottle.
The LARQ Bottle is the world's
first self?cleaning water bottle
that purifies water on the go.
With a simple press of a button
and in just 60 seconds,
the LARQ Bottle activates
our patented UV?C LED
technology, PureVis,
to eradicate 99.99%
of harmful and odor?causing
bacteria, viruses, and mold.
The result ?? pure water
from a pristinely clean bottle.
So, Sharks, who's thirsty
for a great deal?
[ Chuckles ]
Just want to be clear
I heard you properly.
$500,000 for 1%?
That's correct, Robert.
O'Leary: Congratulations.
Highest valuation ever requested
in the Shark Tank.
You seem like
a reasonable human being.
Tell us why
it's $50 million.
By the way, in all transparency,
I have a couple of these.
Oh, you do? Great.
Yeah.
You do?
That is awesome.
I do.
But what's the market
opportunity that justifies this?
So it's a huge market.
Big water's a real thing.
It's a $300 billion market
worldwide,
of which reusable market
is only 7%, and it's growing.
I tried to swear off of
single?use plastic water bottles
several years ago.
I bought several
reusable options,
and sure enough, they ended up
in the back of the cabinet
or in my gym bag.
They would collect mold.
If it sat in my car,
it would get stinky.
Ugh.
So it's the self?cleaning part
that's worth ??
It's the self?cleaning
and purifies.
It looks to me like
you have a UV light in the top.
Can you explain how this works
and what it does?
This is actually
an optical system
that's designed to reflect
the UV light inside.
So simply you press this button.
The UV light turns on.
My co?founder is a PhD
in physics from Caltech.
He's engineered this
to bounce the optical light
throughout the bottle.
So then how many minutes
does it take to do that?
We have two modes.
Our normal mode is 60 seconds.
And then we have adventure mode,
which is three minutes ??
so if you want to take it to
a developing country or camping
or you're just somewhere where
you don't quite trust the water.
Justin, is it safer
than boiling water?
It would be the equivalent
of boiling water
for like 20 minutes.
Really?
Competition.
Are you the only one that has
UV activation and cleaning?
We launched
in October of 2018.
We were the first one
on the market.
We have about 10 patents,
both utility and design,
around this product
and other products.
Wow, that's a lot.
But there are
copycats out there
that we're pursuing potential
legal actions for right now.
So, Justin,
why is it worth $50 million?
So we launched this product
in 2018,
so we've been on the market
for a little under two years.
Almost two years, huh?
Under two years, and in
our first full year in 2019,
we did a little over
$5.5 million in sales.
There you go.
In the last 12 months,
we've done
over $9 million.
This year, we're planning
on doing $14 million.
How much are you gonna make
on the $14 million?
So we brought on our first
outside venture capital round
earlier this year
in January,
and we leaned into
growing the business.
So this year, we're expecting
to lose about $1 million.
Herjavec: Justin,
how much did you raise?
$6.7 million.
At what valuation?
At a $31.7 million
valuation.
Cuban: So, Justin,
let's talk real business.
You've only raised
$6.7 million.
How much do you have
in the bank?
I have about $6.5 million.
Okay, so you really haven't
had to spend anything, right?
Good for you.
Yeah.
What do these retail for?
The one you have right there
is $95.
I paid $95 for this?
Yeah, see?
Holy crap.
Herjavec:
It's actually not bad.
And it costs you what
to make it?
The landed cost
is around $40.
You said you had
a lot of patents.
Yeah.
What are those other products
you already have?
Some of those patents just cover
some other applications,
but some of them do apply
to the new product.
This is the LARQ Pitcher,
which is our first foray
into the home.
Let me do that real quick.
And while that's going,
I'll show you a video
of how that works.
Traditional water pitchers
use a filter.
And the biggest problem is that
they only trap contaminates,
where they could quickly
accumulate and multiply
and actually reverse?contaminate
your water.
Why do they
reverse?contaminate?
Because the contaminants
are being trapped
and collected there,
and as germs are growing,
there is a wet, porous
environment that's dark.
So imagine all the things
that could be growing there.
So we take
a two?step approach.
The first step,
you see it go through,
and it captures things
like lead, cadmium, mercury.
In the second step,
you simply press this button,
and it'll purify the water
that's gone through.
And as you can see,
that is clear water
that we poured blue water in
that's contaminated.
So clear water, but is
anybody else doing this?
No one's doing this.
A million people
on the planet
don't have access
to clean water.
Yep.
And 1.5 million don't
have access to electricity.
Yeah.
So I don't think
any of those people
are getting this bottle
right now
because they
don't have $95.
1% of all our proceeds
go to our charity partner,
1% for the Planet,
charity: water, Well Aware,
where we build wells
in Africa.
1% of profits?
1% of revenue we pledge.
Of revenue?
Of gross revenue?
Gross revenue.
Okay.
1%, that is impressive
off top line.
I mean, you're committed.
I get it.
I am committed.
That is important.
Daymond was gonna stick
a skewer through you.
No, I might still, but I want to
just lay out where I am, okay?
I think we're at a time
where people are really angry.
They're looking for hope.
Mm?hmm.
And when I signed up
to this platform,
the platform
didn't start off
as the wealthy
helping the wealthy.
With $6.5 million in the bank,
I just could not do this
because I just think that I'm
here for a different reason.
I think this is crazy.
I'll let the other Sharks
discuss it.
But I'm out.
I also come from a background
where I didn't have a lot.
It's unfortunate that you won't
take that journey with me.
But I respect
what you're saying.
So let me
take a shot at it.
I support a charity
called One Drop.
Making sure everybody can drink
fresh water around the world
is something
I can get behind.
Love to be involved in this,
but I'm not doing it for 1%.
I bring too much value.
I've never done a deal for 1%
for obvious reasons.
I'll do it for 4%.
I don't care
how you structure it ??
advisory shares,
whatever.
So you want him to do it
at almost one?third
of his last round?
I understand.
I didn't say <i>you</i> would
like it, Mark, or you would.
I'm just telling you
what I would do.
Is there other offers
out there?
Greiner: You know, to give you
half a million dollars for 1%,
I feel like
I'm not making anything.
The category that we're in
is gigantic.
It's a $300 billion industry.
And it's so ripe for disruption
and so ripe for innovation.
Honestly here, like ??
I'm willing to take offers
and listen to counteroffers.
?Make an offer, Lori.
?Make an offer, Lori.
I would love to work with you.
I would love it.
$500,000 for 5%.
[ Laughs ] You keep on
going backwards, Justin.
Herjavec:
Justin, the problem with 1%
is you're priced
for perfection.
And, yes, I would love
to own 1% of Apple,
and I would love
to own 1% of Tesla.
But the odds
are just so low.
To make it easier
for your investors,
I'll do $500,000 for 3%.
We can work out the other 2%
from your advisory pool.
Mm?hmm.
That's my offer.
O'Leary:
And, Mark, are you anywhere?
Yeah,
I know where I'm at.
So, look, there's
different platforms
for different reasons,
right?
This is a place
where people come
where they just need
a little bit more fuel,
they need
a little bit of help.
We're not here
to evaluate companies
that may be billion dollars
in sales
over a trillion?dollar market
in 20 years, which is possible,
but this is not
the place to do it.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
So you have three offers.
What do you want to do?
You know, the offers
are all great
but, even without
the advisory shares,
below my last valuation
of $32 million?ish, right?
To be honest with you,
that's really my bottom line.
What about we got you all in
for half a million dollars each
for $1.5 million total
at 4.5%?
And I will also throw in
advisory share of 1%
split between the three of you.
So for a total, it would be 5.5%
for that money.
2%.
Yeah.
Okay, here's
something we'll do.
Would you consider $1.5 million
for 6% and each Shark gets 2%?
And Justin has one offer
on the table
from Kevin, Lori, and Robert
for his water?purification
company, LARQ.
Huge value for you.
$1.5 million,
$500,000 each, for 6%.
What say you?
I could accept the offer
with one condition ??
that structured in a way
that $1.5 million for 4.5%
and the remaining 1.5%
would be advisory shares
to be divided among you.
My question is, do I get 2%
for my $500,000?
You do.
How long is the vesting period
for the advisory shares?
24 months.
Based on what?
Forget the vesting period.
Greiner: Yeah, what are you
basing that on?
Like, what do I have to do
to get my advisory shares?
I think we just have
a conversation
about what we could do
with the business,
how we could build it
together.
Oh, God.
Maybe it's QVC.
Maybe it's
developing channels.
Justin, let me make it
very simple.
It's too complicated.
You know what?
I'm out
because I've worked really hard
to get to this point.
I don't need you
to interview me.
Greiner: I don't want
contingencies on it.
You know that we're
going to be involved.
We don't want to see that
just evaporate.
Absolutely, absolutely.
I'm in for 2%.
for $500,000.
I'll do $1 million for 4%
split between you and Lori.
I'm in.
No advisory,
just straight?
Advisory will just vest.
No contingencies.
So half a million dollars each
for 1.5%
plus .5% in advisory shares,
2% total.
I don't want
advisory shares.
I like just the equity.
Can you do that?
Look, I want her
part of the deal for sure.
I see lots of value here.
Whatever it takes to get her
on board, I want the same.
So are you putting a stake
in the sand here?
Yeah, I would go 2%.
Okay, well,
that's what we got to do.
But not advisory shares.
What if those shares
just vested up front?
'Cause I have to
structure something
where I'm not going below
my last valuation.
It's 2% up front.
Done.
Done. Alright.
Yes!
Let's light up
the world.
?Thank you so much.
?Oh, that was really good.
Congratulations, Justin.
Good luck.
It feels like I was just in the
trenches, but I'm so excited.
I know we're gonna go places.
Whoo!
I knew they were interested,
and, you know,
I thought that I was gonna
lose them for a second.
But I'm so glad both Lori and
Kevin ended up coming across,
and having those guys
in my corner is just so awesome.
I can't believe it.
