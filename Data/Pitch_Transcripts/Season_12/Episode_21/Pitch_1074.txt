Hey, Sharks,
my name is Justin Wang.
I'm here today
to ask for $500,000
for 1% of my company, LARQ.
[ Laughter ]
Have you ever noticed
that funky smell
coming from your
reusable water bottle?
I bet you have.
Oh, man.
Justin, is it safer
than boiling water?
It would be the equivalent
of boiling water
for like 20 minutes.
Really?
Competition.
So, Justin,
why is it worth $50 million?
So we launched this product
in 2018,
so we've been on the market
for a little under two years.
Almost two years, huh?
Herjavec: Justin,
how much did you raise?
$6.7 million.
At what valuation?
At a $31.7 million
valuation.
Cuban: So, Justin,
let's talk real business.
You've only raised
$6.7 million.
How much do you have
in the bank?
I have about $6.5 million.
Okay, so you really haven't
had to spend anything, right?
Good for you.
Yeah.
What do these retail for?
The one you have right there
is $95.
I paid $95 for this?
Yeah, see?
Holy crap.
[ Laughs ] You keep on
going backwards, Justin.
Herjavec:
Justin, the problem with 1%
is you're priced
for perfection.
And Justin has one offer
on the table
Justin, let me make it
very simple.
It's too complicated.
You know what?
I'm out
because I've worked really hard
to get to this point.
I don't need you
to interview me.
Greiner: I don't want
contingencies on it.
You know that we're
going to be involved.
We don't want to see that
just evaporate.
Absolutely, absolutely.
I'm in for 2%.
for $500,000.
Congratulations, Justin.
Good luck.
It feels like I was just in the
trenches, but I'm so excited.
I know we're gonna go places.
Whoo!
