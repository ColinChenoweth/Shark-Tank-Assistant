Marcotte: This tiny object
changed everything.
Sharks,
let us break the ice.
Your logo is so close
to Scrub Daddy's.
I'm doing this alone.
You've got to sell, man.
I will never not know
how to make money.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kaylin Marcotte.
Kaylin, first of all,
you're a supernova.
Thank you.
I'm trying to remember
if we've ever had somebody
go from zero
to your kind of numbers.
This is
a great business,
but at the $10 million
value that you're implying,
I have to believe
that your sales are gonna be
tens of millions
for me to recoup
my investment.
I don't see it continuing
at that trajectory.
I think people will
move on to other things.
I'm out.
Kaylin, you're
incredibly impressive.
One of the most impressive
people I've seen
in a very long time.
Thank you.
I do think that you're
benefiting from the COVID push,
Kaylin has an offer
on the table from Kevin,
Kaylin,
15% is a good deal.
Yeah, 'cause
that's the difference
between when you get to
$10 million in profit,
making $500,000 in return.
Totally, totally.
Yeah, you know
the math.
But we have a clear
line of sight ??
I thought he was
going to say 25%.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm serious.
I haven't even told you about
what we're gonna do next year.
No, Kaylin, you
do not need capital.
Jump start. Growth capital.
This is a very
rare situation.
This is a very
rare situation.
Take his half a million
dollars for 15% to you,
as secondary shares.
Doesn't go into
the business.
It goes into
your pocket.
Why is this
a good idea?
Because you're gonna
walk more confident.
Because you're gonna
take more risks.
Because you're gonna have
that little nest egg.
The business doesn't
need the cash,
Cuban: So, Kaylin,
what do you think?
I've never seen
that before.
Look, he's right.
$500,000 in your pocket,
living in New York,
when you've been
stressing this whole time
is not a bad thing.
But then, on the flip side,
how much of an accelerant
would it be
to the business?
Because if you can get enough
of a multiple on that,
then it could be worth
$10 million, $20 million,
$30 million
in your pocket.
Yes. Yes.
That's the decision.
But you own 100% of it.
Yes, I do.
If we could bring
the investment up
to get to that 15% ??
It's not that you need
more capital.
It's something that
you feel you want
because you set
a threshold, right?
[ Sighs ]
You know, 15 is more than
I was hoping to go to today.
Great job, Kaylin.
Thank you all.
?I can't wait.
?Good job.
?Thank you so much.
?Kaylin, you are amazing.
?This will be exciting.
?Thank you. Thank you.
Congratulations.
I didn't get
to give you my offer.
I know, Lori. I'm sorry.
All good.
