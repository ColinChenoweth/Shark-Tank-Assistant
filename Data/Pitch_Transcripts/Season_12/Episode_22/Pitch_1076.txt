Marcotte: This tiny object
changed everything.
Sharks,
let us break the ice.
Your logo is so close
to Scrub Daddy's.
I'm doing this alone.
You've got to sell, man.
I will never not know
how to make money.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kaylin Marcotte.
I am from New York City,
and I'm here seeking $500,000
in exchange for
5% of my company.
Wow.
Stress and mental exhaustion
can wreak havoc on our minds,
bodies, and relationships.
Five years ago,
I was working around the clock
at an early start?up
and was looking
for a new and healthy way
to unwind and unplug.
I tried meditation, yoga,
even essential oils
without much success.
And then this tiny object
changed everything.
A jigsaw puzzle.
Focusing on one simple task
and building something
piece by piece
felt both relaxing
and rewarding.
I lost the urge
to check my phone
and truly cleared my head.
Problem was, all
the puzzles on the market
are outdated, uninspired,
and, well, kind of lame.
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, let me
introduce you to Jiggy ??
modern puzzles with a mission.
Each Jiggy features unique art
by an emerging female artist
from around the world.
A percentage of every sale
goes directly to that artist,
empowering these
up?and?coming creatives
and giving them a platform
to showcase their work.
Each puzzle comes
in a reusable glass jar
and includes simple tools
to preserve your work of art.
When the final piece
is in place,
simply spread our puzzle glue
over the pieces
and transform it into a
beautifully crafted art print.
We are reinventing
the humble jigsaw puzzle
and reconnecting people
with both mindfulness and art,
one piece at a time.
Now, who's ready to
get Jiggy with us?
In front of you,
you have some puzzles,
each a different artwork.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Cuban: That's cool.
The pieces come in this
reusable glass jar.
We've seen people use them as
a cookie jar or a flower vase.
Greiner: It's pretty.
Behind it is
a tube of puzzle glue,
and then in front is
a gold straight?edge tool.
It helps spread the glue.
How long does it take?
These pieces are tiny.
How many pieces
are in a typical puzzle?
Probably 500 to 1,000.
Our kids and I, my wife
and I love doing puzzles,
but you need to
solve one puzzle for me.
How did you get
to this valuation?
Because it really is
very intimidating.
Yeah.
Yeah, so, we just launched
nine months ago.
In the last nine months, we have
done $1.6 million in sales.
What? Wow.
Cuban: Good for you.
This first year,
we're going to do 2.25.
We're profitable.
Tell me,
did you do that alone?
Yes, I'm a one?woman show.
Oh, my gosh.
And you own 100%?
Yeah.
Bootstrapped, no debt.
Good for you.
Good for you.
No investors.
No equity partners.
Very impressive.
Your timing was unique,
lucky, and perfect,
because all of a sudden,
you're into COVID.
Everybody's at home,
and you're getting
this huge ramp.
Marcotte: Right.
What was your profit
on that $1.6 million?
We're netting 40%,
so this year
on a two and a quarter,
we're gonna make 900.
That's unbelievable.
Wow!
So why do you
need us?
So, I'm doing this alone.
I'm here for a partner.
The incumbents in this space
are following a retail,
kind of old?school playbook.
No one is digitally native.
No one is competing in SEO
and digital marketing.
It's like a land grab right now.
You're doing it
all online?
This first year is going to be
60% D2C, 40% wholesale.
We were approached
earlier this year
by an upscale national retailer,
and we're going to be
in 215 stores.
What does
a puzzle sell for?
So, we retail these
for $40 and $48.
Costs you what
to make them?
$10.
$10.
And how much
does the artist get?
The artist makes, on average,
$3,000 to $5,000
for our first run.
What percentage of
the buyers now are repeat?
First, we surveyed
our customers.
We are expanding this category.
Half of our customers had never
bought a jigsaw puzzle before.
Ever?
25% indicated 8 to 10
on a scale of 10
that they would want
even something monthly.
25%?
Like a subscription membership.
You're suggesting there might be
a subscription model to this?
Yes. We would curate
new, monthly images.
What we're seeing is
people who do return
are buying, on average,
four puzzles.
What happens when
COVID is gone?
These macro trends that
inspired me to start this,
of self?care and analog,
those have been around
for a long time.
We did a quarter million in our
first four months, pre?COVID,
and then we sold out.
Wow.
You are great
at branding.
Thank you.
Kaylin, first of all,
you're a supernova.
Thank you.
I'm trying to remember
if we've ever had somebody
go from zero
to your kind of numbers.
This is
a great business,
but at the $10 million
value that you're implying,
I have to believe
that your sales are gonna be
tens of millions
for me to recoup
my investment.
I don't see it continuing
at that trajectory.
I think people will
move on to other things.
I'm out.
Kaylin, you're
incredibly impressive.
One of the most impressive
people I've seen
in a very long time.
Thank you.
I do think that you're
benefiting from the COVID push,
and the valuation
is not the right valuation,
but I also don't think
you need a Shark.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
And best wishes.
You know, I'm struggling with
how much of this is sustainable,
post?COVID.
I would give you an offer,
but I'd have to
mitigate my risk,
and I'd do it this way.
[ Chuckles ]
I would give you $100,000
for 15% equity
and a loan
for $400,000 at 10%
for 36 months.
[ Herjavec laughs ]
Okay.
And ?? Well, I don't hear you
putting up a check.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.
You are a Shark.
What I don't know is
tomorrow morning,
vaccine, people get on
with their lives,
and they're saying,
"What was that puzzle?"
I mean,
that's the problem.
I don't ??
Cuban: You know, as crazy
as Mr. Wonderful is,
he's right in
one respect.
The problem is
just the valuation.
You've got to make
$10 million in cash flow
that you distribute
in order for that 5% of that
to come back
as $500,000 to me.
Look, there are
a lot of great branders.
There's a lot
of great marketers.
What there aren't
are a lot of people
who are great marketers
or branders
who also know
how to monetize.
That's what makes you
a great entrepreneur.
You know, it's just not
a great investment.
I mean, I would do anything
to be in business with you
going forward,
but only getting 5% for every
$10 million in cash flow
is not enough
for me to get excited.
I think you'd be
an amazing partner.
Is there a percentage that
you would feel like you
had skin in the game
and could be a partner
for me in this?
Kaylin has an offer
on the table from Kevin,
and Mark seems interested,
but he is struggling with
the small 5% stake
she is offering for
her puzzle company, Jiggy.
Is there a percentage that
you would feel like
you had skin in the game
and could be a partner for me
in this?
I mean, it'd have
to be 15%.
Would you scale
an investment with that
at $1.5 million for 15%?
No.
Because it's still
the same math, right?
It's linear
at that point.
What would you counter for 10%?
It'd have to be
the 15%, 'cause remember ??
Kaylin,
15% is a good deal.
Yeah, 'cause
that's the difference
between when you get to
$10 million in profit,
making $500,000 in return.
Totally, totally.
Yeah, you know
the math.
But we have a clear
line of sight ??
I thought he was
going to say 25%.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm serious.
I haven't even told you about
what we're gonna do next year.
We're going to do $5 million
and net 2 of that.
The unit economics work.
I want growth capital
and to accelerate it,
but the business is working,
and we're self?funding.
You just need capital,
is what I just heard you say.
No, Kaylin, you
do not need capital.
Jump start. Growth capital.
This is a very
rare situation.
This is a very
rare situation.
Take his half a million
dollars for 15% to you,
as secondary shares.
Doesn't go into
the business.
It goes into
your pocket.
Why is this
a good idea?
Because you're gonna
walk more confident.
Because you're gonna
take more risks.
Because you're gonna have
that little nest egg.
The business doesn't
need the cash,
and you have a Mark Cuban
that's gonna help you.
Are you saying that Mark is
gonna give the money to her?
He writes
a $500,000 check,
and it goes into
her pocket.
Mark, what do
you say?
Because her business
is so great.
It's great having Daniel
negotiate for you, Mark.
Cuban: So, Kaylin,
what do you think?
I've never seen
that before.
Look, he's right.
$500,000 in your pocket,
living in New York,
when you've been
stressing this whole time
is not a bad thing.
But then, on the flip side,
how much of an accelerant
would it be
to the business?
Because if you can get enough
of a multiple on that,
then it could be worth
$10 million, $20 million,
$30 million
in your pocket.
Yes. Yes.
That's the decision.
But you own 100% of it.
Yes, I do.
If we could bring
the investment up
to get to that 15% ??
It's not that you need
more capital.
It's something that
you feel you want
because you set
a threshold, right?
[ Sighs ]
You know, 15 is more than
I was hoping to go to today.
And...
That's why they
call it "Shark Tank."
[ Chuckles ] I know.
I watch the show.
I knew that. Um...
I have an ask
on top of the offer.
As you know, we're
a mission?driven company
dedicated to supporting artists.
Will you match our
fundraising efforts this year,
if I meet at your 15%?
And what do you
anticipate raising?
We've done 20 so far.
I want to go over 50.
So, just match
the $50,000?
Okay, easy.
Okay.
Got a deal?
We have a deal!
Done!
Aaaah!
Great job, Kaylin.
Thank you all.
?I can't wait.
?Good job.
?Thank you so much.
?Kaylin, you are amazing.
?This will be exciting.
?Thank you. Thank you.
Congratulations.
I didn't get
to give you my offer.
I know, Lori. I'm sorry.
All good.
Empowering female artists
is such a part of our mission,
and now with Mark on our team
and this wind at our backs,
we can scale that impact
across the world.
The only risk
you've got is
does it roll over
after COVID?
No, I invested
in her.
Herjavec: She was
phenomenal.
This business
may roll over.
This business.
Fine.
We pivot and go to
something else.
