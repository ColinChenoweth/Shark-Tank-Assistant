That doesn't matter!
I want to buy
the entire company.
We would take a million.
Bam.
You want how much?
[ Laughs ]
Kessler: Alright, this is it.
[ Inhaling deeply ]
Ain't no better time
than now, boys.
Ain't no better time
than now.
Ain't no better
time than now.
Let's do it.
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Matt.
Okay, Tyler.
We get it.
Hosey: If we wanted to
spend more money on it,
we could have created
a better model,
but we wanted to get
our margins, costs lower.
So with this unit, we're paying
hardly next to nothing for it.
We paid $3.16.
Is it a prototype?
These are
manufactured units.
O'Leary:
What kind of sales we got?
Okay, so 2019 ??
the Scrubbie's
an amazing product.
It's one?of?a?kind.
It's the first of its kind.
Do you have a patent?
When we get the adjectives,
there's no number, that's bad.
Yes, we have two patents,
Tyler, why can't you answer
Kevin's question?
Yeah, no, so, totally ??
Tell us your
forecast for this year.
Sales this year,
the forecast for this year,
if we are predictive
from other companies
that want to do
business with us,
their projection's
that we will do
around $320,000 this year.
Yeah, so they're just guessing.
There's no real <i>there</i> there.
Right? That's the problem.
That's why you're here.
So have you sold
to any stores
Dakin: We had
the opportunity.
We were approached
by a company
that did want ??
No, no, no,
that's not the point.
That's not the point.
It's that ourselves
should have gone out ??
Yeah.
?We wanted to ??
?If I have to tell you ??
?It doesn't matter!
It's just another excuse.
Cuban: It doesn't matter!
Right. Look, I've heard every
eeny?meeny?miny?mo excuse, guys.
We wanted to...
I'm out.
Does it not bother you that you
designed something that looks,
from a logo,
name perspective,
almost exactly like another
product Lori invested in
that shall remain nameless?
You think it looks similar to ??
It doesn't bother you?
I mean, the name kind of
sounds the same,
but that's not the same.
Okay, so I'm glad that
Robert brought that up.
Not necessarily.
I was about to before I was
so <i>rudely</i> interrupted.
Are you going to sue them
into the Stone Age?
So, wait,
here's the thing, guys.
Your logo is so close
to Scrub Daddy's.
You used the same
font, right?
But Scrub Daddy? Scrubbie?
Hosey: For the record,
we thought of this
before Scrub Daddy
existed.
Did you think about this
while you were doing it?
Not at all.
It never crossed your mind?
'Cause it's really,
very coincidental...
Really?
...that it's
the same font.
Honestly, no.
When our designer
came up with this,
we thought
it looked great.
When your logo's really close,
I don't like that,
