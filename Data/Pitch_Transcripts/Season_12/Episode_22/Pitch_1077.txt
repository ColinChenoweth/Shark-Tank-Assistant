Hi, Sharks.
I'm India.
We won Best Hot Dog.
India: Hot dog.
But it's not your hot dog.
You must get...
It's not our hot dog.
It's what we do with it.
We put our
magic spin on it.
So tell us about
the restaurant.
Absolutely.
We have two restaurants.
India runs
Virginia Beach, Virginia.
My other daughter, Olivia,
who couldn't be here today,
runs Boulder, Colorado.
We decided to become
a vegan company
at the beginning
of 2019.
What were you
before that?
I was a real estate
investment broker.
India, how proud are you
of your mother?
[ Laughs ]
I love her.
She's amazing.
Thank you.
[ Voice breaking ] Like I said,
she's a firecracker.
Aren't my girls
awesome?
Lubetzky:
I find you so inspiring
