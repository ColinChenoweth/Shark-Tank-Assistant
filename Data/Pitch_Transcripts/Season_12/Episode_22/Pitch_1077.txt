Hi, Sharks,
I'm Cassandra Ayala,
and I'm here today with one
of my three beautiful daughters.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm India.
Both: And we're the Bumbling Bee
Vegan Junk Food and Burger Bar.
[ Chuckles ]
Sharks, we're here today
looking for $150,000
for 10%
of our company.
Sharks, when you think
of vegan food,
do you think
bland and boring?
Well, we are crushing that myth
that plant?based food
has to be just
twigs and berries.
Our vegan junk food
is unlike anything
you've ever had before.
Whether it's our
juicy Clucker,
a double?dip
fried chicken sandwich...
Mm. We got that.
...our award?winning
Coney Island chili cheese dogs
with the hand?cut
Cajun fries,
or a fat, juicy burger
dripping with
our creamy
cheddar cheese sauce.
Yum!
Don't forget to
finish it off
with one of our
sweet nectar milkshakes.
The Bumbling Bee
Junk Food and Burger Bar
Yes.
Cassandra:
All of that is vegan.
100%.
Every bit.
?Oh, my God.
?Yay!
The mac and cheese
is really good.
We have won the award
for Best Hot Dog in our area.
And I don't mean
Best Vegan Hot Dog.
We won Best Hot Dog.
India: Hot dog.
But it's not your hot dog.
You must get...
It's not our hot dog.
It's what we do with it.
We put our
magic spin on it.
So tell us about
the restaurant.
Absolutely.
We have two restaurants.
India runs
Virginia Beach, Virginia.
My other daughter, Olivia,
who couldn't be here today,
runs Boulder, Colorado.
We decided to become
a vegan company
at the beginning
of 2019.
What were you
before that?
I was a real estate
investment broker.
Flipped a lot of houses
with my husband.
Unfortunately,
I got trapped,
and that was
the market crash.
So when
the market crashed,
I had $10,000
to my name.
So I went and I said,
"What can I do with this money?"
So I started with a food cart,
a hot dog cart,
took my money
from the hot dog cart,
bought a trailer.
Took the money
from the trailer,
bought a truck.
And I got it
to the point
where I had four trucks
plus a backup truck.
Four. [ Laughs ] Yep.
And I got to the point
where it wasn't
worth it to me
anymore
to kill myself
for that kind of money,
if my kids weren't interested
in being part of it.
I needed something that
my daughters could be a part of.
So that's when I said to them,
"What is it gonna take
to get you
passionate about this?"
My other daughter, Lexi,
was a healthy vegan.
What's missing
in the market?
Junk food.
Well, can I ask
you your economics?
Yes.
Because in order to
franchise,
you have to be able
to operate at about
17% to 20% pre?tax profit
per location.
We are at a 15% margin.
Last year, switched over
with our first truck in June.
Then we opened up our
brick and mortar,
which was my commissary,
in October.
That's what you want? You want
more brick and mortars, right?
No, I want both.
Tell me your sales
for last year.
$194,000 for one truck
part?time
and one brick and mortar
that opened in October.
Now, what's this year
gonna look like?
$324,000 came from
Virginia Beach, Virginia,
which was closed
for six weeks?
Yes.
And Boulder, Colorado,
which opened January 16th
and closed April 4th
and reopened July 25th.
And with that, we also
pulled back our food trucks.
Right, we had to pull back
our food trucks
because events
were canceled.
And how are you doing that?
You're still open, or...?
Yes.
Heck, yeah.
Greiner:
You have huge spunk...
Thank you!
...and passion
and obviously grit.
I mean, lots of words
come to mind with you.
Firecracker.
I love her.
Firecracker, right?
So where do you think
you get your drive from?
My parents separated
when I was very early.
My mother was a ??
she's recovering now,
for almost 50 years,
but she was
an alcoholic,
and I grew up in
the homeless shelters.
I learned how to
dumpster dive
at 8 years old
to get my food.
But that led me
to understand
that I wanted to be
a stronger person.
I wanted to have control
of where I went in my life.
I will never
be hungry.
I will never not know
how to make money.
And I don't think that
I would change anything,
because I would not be
the woman I am today.
That's a great story.
Good for you. Well done.
?Thank you.
?Yeah, good for you.
?Congratulations.
That's, you know,
they say the strongest swords
are forged in
the hottest fires.
You're beaming.
India, how proud are you
of your mother?
[ Laughs ]
I love her.
She's amazing.
Thank you.
[ Voice breaking ] Like I said,
she's a firecracker.
Aren't my girls
awesome?
Lubetzky:
I find you so inspiring
and the challenges
that you overcame,
but for me, I don't see
enough differentiation
between other things
that I've seen.
I'm not completely
drawn to the food.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
There's not that one
thing that makes it
impossible to copy,
right?
Your execution,
your relentlessness
will make it successful.
Anybody can
copy McDonald's.
But McDonald's also
started in 1955...
Right.
...and was one of the first
with drive?throughs.
Yes, and we're one of the first
vegan junk foods.
Well, yeah,
and that's true,
but again, you haven't
gotten that scale yet
where you can say
to everybody else,
"We don't care what you do."
Right?
Right.
Which just makes it
very hard.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Herjavec:
Cassandra, amazing job.
I mean, you know, one of
the great things about business,
it gives you the freedom
to do the things you love
and spend the time
with your family.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I will tell you, in California,
I've seen this.
Yes.
And it's a race ?? Whether
you realize it or not,
you're not the first one.
You're not the only one.
There's lots of them.
That's right.
And I would never
bet against you
and the Bumblebee family.
But as a business,
I don't know if it's
ready for an investment
until you get to
a critical point of scale.
Only for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think that it would be smarter
for you to not expand,
to stay solid and grow
what you have right now.
I'm not going to invest.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
We appreciate it.
Cassandra, I really connected
with your story,
'cause I lost my father
when he was 37.
I was raised by my mother,
and she was very tough.
But I learned from what she did,
that that gives you power.
So, for you, obviously,
you've earned that.
It gets me emotional
just thinking about it.
But your numbers,
they're not investable.
You need to make at least
$500,000 per location
on a 20% pre?tax profit.
And, you know, I try
and keep the discipline
of not letting my emotions
tug me into a deal
that doesn't make
economic sense,
and that's the only reason
I'm out.
Well, I do hope that you will
all come and eat at it.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's our pleasure
to have been picked by you.
You guys are amazing.
Congratulations
on all you've accomplished.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye.
