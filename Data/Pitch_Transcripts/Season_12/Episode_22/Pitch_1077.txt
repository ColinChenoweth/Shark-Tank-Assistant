That doesn't matter!
I want to buy
the entire company.
We would take a million.
Bam.
You want how much?
[ Laughs ]
Kessler: Alright, this is it.
[ Inhaling deeply ]
Ain't no better time
than now, boys.
Ain't no better time
than now.
Ain't no better
time than now.
Let's do it.
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Matt.
I'm Jeff.
And I'm Tyler.
And we're seeking
$100,000
in exchange for 10% of our
company called the Scrubbie.
It's called
the what?
The Scrubbie!
The Scrubbie!
Now, Sharks,
almost everyone
has a kitchen
sink sprayer
and probably tried using it
to clean off dishes
at one time
or another.
The problem is, to get the last
bit of food off your plate,
you're going to end up
scratching your fine china.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
And you're probably gonna get
a little wet in the process.
The Scrubbie is a universal
cleaning attachment
that turns your
ordinary sink sprayer
into a supercharged
cleaning machine.
By harnessing
high?pressure water
and putting a scrubbing
attachment right
where you need it,
the Scrubbie
cuts down cleaning time
and conserves water.
And since you're not physically
touching the scrubber,
you can clean
using hot water
with no worries about
burning your hands.
Oh!
Not only that,
the Scrubbie's gonna adapt
to your newer, pull?down
style faucets, as well.
?Say what?!
?You heard it here.
The Scrubbie's center piece
will pop out and reverse.
With its flexible,
tapered interior ridges,
it'll attach in a flash
and be ready to rock.
But wait, Sharks.
Together: There's more!
Darn right,
there is.
Check this out.
The Scrubbie has
a threaded interior,
so you can
take it outdoors
and screw it right on
your garden hose.
That's right, Sharks.
Use it to clean off
your outdoor tables and chairs,
your car wheels and tires,
your windows and doors,
your boat, your coolers,
your ?? your birdbath.
Okay, Tyler.
We get it.
Indoors or out, the Scrubbie
will handle the chore.
And we're confident
that with your help,
we can make this
a success.
Now, which one of
you Sharks
is ready to
clean house with ??
Together: The Scrubbie!
[ Chuckles ]
Good job, guys.
So, is this
interchangeable?
So this is your
scratchy side,
this is your
soft side.
Yes, exactly.
And then it's disposable.
You just throw it away?
Disposable as well.
It comes with...
And you get refills.
It comes with
three sponges.
How much does it cost?
$14.99 is what
we're selling it for.
And what are
the replacement sponges?
Well, we're selling them for
$9.99 for three of them,
and that's on
a subscription base,
so every two months,
you get three sponges.
A Scrubbie subscription?
Scrubbie subscription.
I bet Scrub Daddy
doesn't have subscriptions.
They don't need to.
O'Leary: Guys, can I just make
a comment about it?
First time
I've ever seen it.
It's ugly.
I mean, it looks very,
very industrial to me.
Hosey: If we wanted to
spend more money on it,
we could have created
a better model,
but we wanted to get
our margins, costs lower.
So with this unit, we're paying
hardly next to nothing for it.
We paid $3.16.
Is it a prototype?
These are
manufactured units.
O'Leary:
What kind of sales we got?
Okay, so 2019 ??
the Scrubbie's
an amazing product.
It's one?of?a?kind.
It's the first of its kind.
Do you have a patent?
When we get the adjectives,
there's no number, that's bad.
Yes, we have two patents,
and one in the
application process.
Utility patent?
One utility patent
and one pending.
So, guys, tell us
about sales.
Is there a number?
So, 2019, we did a launch
at a local trade show
in Wichita, and we killed it ??
everybody loved it.
What's "killed it"?
O'Leary: And?
So in those two days, we sold
a couple hundred Scrubbies.
How many dollars?
So, in dollar sense,
what we made at the show?
No, just give me 2019 sales.
What did you sell?
I've asked you five times.
So, total,
we sold 868 Scrubbies.
How many dollars is that?
That is right around
$13,000.
Ohh.
Now, what's this year
gonna look like?
Yep, sales wise, we ??
we, business?wise,
we did
some online marketing.
We didn't have
enough funds to do...
Last year.
...a successful online
marketing campaign and content.
It's never good
when Mr. Wonderful,
who loves numbers,
asks you what were
sales in 2019?
What are sales in 2020?
I mean, just give me
a number.
Right, so, total sales
to date is 868.
Dollars?
868 Scrubbies.
Tyler, why can't you answer
Kevin's question?
Yeah, no, so, totally ??
Tell us your
forecast for this year.
Sales this year,
the forecast for this year,
if we are predictive
from other companies
that want to do
business with us,
their projection's
that we will do
around $320,000 this year.
Yeah, so they're just guessing.
There's no real <i>there</i> there.
Right? That's the problem.
That's why you're here.
So have you sold
to any stores
and put these up
at stores?
We haven't sold
to any stores, no.
We're not in retail.
Greiner:
So, I'm curious.
Have you been watching
"Shark Tank" a long time?
Yes.
Yes, seen a lot
of them.
Greiner: Seen a lot
of them.
Who did your packaging
and your logo?
One of our graphic designers.
It was a friend of mine.
I want to go back to numbers.
So, I have a question.
And I only have
two questions ??
Kevin.
Lori, I got the patent thing.
Why did you so
rudely interrupt me?
Remember, Lori, I'm working
on anger management this season.
I know, and your
anger management classes
are not working.
I just ?? I can't
take it anymore.
I have to ask a question.
I have to ask a question.
Oh, my God.
You are so rude.
Very simple.
Very simple.
Just two numbers.
I'm begging for two numbers.
Lifetime sales to date.
$13,000.
No, all in.
So, lifetime sales
is $13,000.
This business is not worth
a million dollars.
In February, we got pretty
excited at the trade show.
We were the busiest
booth there.
We must have had 50 people
come up to us
and tell us, "You guys
need to be on 'Shark Tank.'"
Why didn't you sell it?
We got the call
the very next day
to get on "Shark Tank."
Cuban: You still could
keep on selling.
Look, guys, do you know
what a 24,000 box score is?
It's when a guy
plays 24 minutes
and gets zero points,
zero assists, and zero rebounds.
Wow.
It's noteworthy because
if you play 24 minutes,
something should
fall in your lap, right?
A ball should come
your way, roll your way.
You accidentally trip
and pass the ball.
You guys sold nothing.
You guys are
a 24,000 box score.
Because just out of chance,
some lightning,
something should have been sold,
and you couldn't find
a way to sell anything.
Dakin: We had
the opportunity.
We were approached
by a company
that did want ??
No, no, no,
that's not the point.
That's not the point.
It's that ourselves
should have gone out ??
Yeah.
We wanted to go out
and knock on every door
that we possibly could,
but we also wanted
to protect our idea.
So we went back to
our patent attorney
and claimed everything.
It doesn't matter!
?We wanted to ??
?If I have to tell you ??
?It doesn't matter!
It's just another excuse.
Cuban: It doesn't matter!
Right. Look, I've heard every
eeny?meeny?miny?mo excuse, guys.
We wanted to...
I'm out.
Does it not bother you that you
designed something that looks,
from a logo,
name perspective,
almost exactly like another
product Lori invested in
that shall remain nameless?
You think it looks similar to ??
It doesn't bother you?
I mean, the name kind of
sounds the same,
but that's not the same.
Okay, so I'm glad that
Robert brought that up.
Not necessarily.
I was about to before I was
so <i>rudely</i> interrupted.
Are you going to sue them
into the Stone Age?
So, wait,
here's the thing, guys.
Your logo is so close
to Scrub Daddy's.
You used the same
font, right?
But Scrub Daddy? Scrubbie?
Hosey: For the record,
we thought of this
before Scrub Daddy
existed.
Did you think about this
while you were doing it?
Not at all.
It never crossed your mind?
'Cause it's really,
very coincidental...
Really?
...that it's
the same font.
Honestly, no.
When our designer
came up with this,
we thought
it looked great.
When your logo's really close,
I don't like that,
and I don't want confusion
on the market.
?So ??
?I'm out.
The ?? The Scrub Daddy
doesn't have an attachment
that connects to
your sink sprayer.
And you also don't
have to use your hands.
Our is not the sponge.
It is the attachment.
The future of our product,
we foresee different attachments
for different purposes
to be able to
screw onto the Scrubbie.
Yeah, with a plastic thread,
you can have the car Scrubbie,
the dog Scrubbie.
Guys, I actually found this
intriguing.
But, you know, when I started my
first company out of law school,
PeaceWorks, to promote peace
between Arabs and Israelis,
there was not a period
of one day, let alone one year,
where I just waited.
Like, it was about survival.
I had to figure it out.
We didn't ??
And I eventually decoded it.
We didn't have to wait.
And the fact that you went
for such a long period
trying to figure things out
concerns me a great deal.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Yeah, guys,
you know, to that point,
I mean, to me, there's
two types of entrepreneurs.
There's the hungry,
and there's the satisfied,
and you've been doing this
for two years.
You don't have that
desperation of hunger
that you wake up
and you got to sell, man.
Right. So ??
I'm out.
Guys, I?I really
was underwhelmed.
I think you could have done
a better job with this.
One of you guys
has to sell this stuff.
I am an investor.
I have $100,000.
I have no reason
to give it to you.
I'm out.
So I know the decisions
that we make today
define us tomorrow,
so, I mean,
we're gonna go out, and we're
gonna hit it hard.
Take care, guys.
Good luck.
You guys will
figure it out.
You'll be seeing us.
I hope so, guys.
Good luck, guys.
Really appreciate it.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
Not quite how they
wanted it to go.
[ Chuckles ]
No.
Get off your butt
and sell.
It's good to dream.
It's better to hustle.
Well, darn.
Yep.
Well, we're going to
sell more Scrubbies.
They compared us a lot
to the Scrub Daddy,
but the only thing
we have in common
is that the ability to make
hundreds of millions of dollars,
and we know within
the next few years or less,
we're gonna
reach that goal.
