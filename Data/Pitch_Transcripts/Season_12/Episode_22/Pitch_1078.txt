is the new generation
of fast food.
Whether you're
dairy?free, vegan,
vegetarian
or flexitarian ??
Or just a little
herbivore?curious.
[ Both laugh ]
Both:
There's something for everyone.
And, now, our mom
is our queen bee.
That's me.
But we do need some more
honey to help us
pollinate hives
across the country.
Sharks...
Both: To "bee" or not to "bee"?
That is the question.
?Aha.
?[ Laughs ] Cute.
You've got some rapping skills
there, don't you?
[ Both laugh ]
Hang on.
This is all vegan?
Hola. I'm Keidy.
And I'm Gene.
And we're the makers
of the XTorch.
We are seeking
$150,000
in exchange for 10%
of our business.
Imagine the power
goes out at home
and everything goes dark,
or else you're camping
and your cellphone dies
just when you
need it most.
Sharks,
let us break the ice
and introduce you to
the XTorch.
[ Laughs ]
Herjavec: Whoa. Wow.
Greiner: Wow.
Look at that.
After more than two days
of being frozen
in a block of ice,
it still works.
The XTorch is a super?tough
light and power device
designed to handle even
the most rugged of conditions.
It is solar?powered,
rechargeable,
and it has
three functions.
It works as
a flashlight,
a lantern,
and a cellphone charger.
And I know what
you're thinking, Sharks.
Another solar flashlight?
But the XTorch
is so much more.
It can hold its charge up to
three years in storage,
supply up to 48 hours'
worth of light.
It glows in the dark,
and it even floats.
Best of all,
our company donates
at least
25% of our profits
to our partners
around the globe.
We want to see
the XTorch in every home,
workplace,
and campsite in America,
because when
the power goes out,
everybody needs
reliable backup power.
So, Sharks, who wants to
partner with us
and help us
light the world ??
Both: With the XTorch?
[ Chuckling ] Good job.
Ta?da!
So, how do you
turn this on?
Oh, here,
let me show you.
Well, here, see this
little button right here?
It's the
on/off button.
At the top? Yeah.
Press it down one time.
Uh?huh.
And that's a flashlight.
Uh?huh.
Press it again,
that's a room lantern.
Lubetzky: Whoa.
Oh, I see.
Gene: Yeah.
Wow.
And you press it
a third time,
and you get
a table lantern.
Keidy: Or a work
lantern.
Or a reading
lantern.
Oh, like this.
Yes.
And if you notice,
press it one more time,
it all shuts off.
See these little
green lights here?
It tells you exactly how full
the battery is.
How long would it take
to fully charge, solar?
You stick it outside,
take about 22 hours.
For a full charge,
but ?? but
you can also charge it
with electricity.
How long does it take you
to charge that way?
Only one hour.
About one hour.
But that's not all.
You can charge your
cellphone with it.
With a USB cable,
you plug it in,
and you can charge
your cellphone.
Greiner: I like that.
[ Spooky voice ]
Robert.
Robeeeeert.
Maaaaark.
Keviiiin.
Robeeeert.
Keidy: Oh.
Oh, look at that,
huh?
Oh, wow.
You guys look
very scary.
Especially Mr. Wonderful.
[ Chuckles ]
Herjavec: Look at this.
Look how bright that is.
If the ceiling were lower,
it would be way better.
And that's just
the table lantern.
Okay, best flashlight
in the world.
How much does it cost?
It costs $55.95 on our website,
and it costs...
55 ?? Say it again.
$55.95 on our website.
That's pricy.
It costs us about
$18.50 to manufacture,
but in our next
manufacturing cost,
it'll cost us $14.
Gene and Keidy,
I have a couple questions.
Please.
Yes.
Most important,
you started, "Hola"...
Yes.
but I can't tell if you're
Latin American.
Where are you from?
I am from
the Dominican Republic.
Ah, Dominicana.
I grew up
in the Dominican Republic,
so I experienced
the lack of light.
And I'm sure, because
you grew up in Mexico...
Yes.
...power outages are very common
in Latin American countries.
Greiner: How did you
come up with this?
I lived in Africa
for a year.
We were working with
a food distribution NGO.
Where in Africa
were you living?
I'm sorry?
Equatorial Guinea.
And they speak
Spanish there.
Yeah.
He came to visit there, too,
and I got really sick,
and they didn't know if
it was dengue or malaria.
They didn't know
what it was.
So, I was there, these doctors
came in and they said,
"Hey, we don't know what
this is, but she's dying."
Ooh.
So they put an IV in her.
Herjavec: Wow.
She's under this mosquito net.
There's no power
in this whole community.
And they give me this bag
full of different?colored pills
and says, "You have to
give your fiancée,
the love of your life,
these medications,
or she's going to die."
I'm in the middle of the night,
trying to read Spanish.
My Spanish was about
this big at that time,
and I've got this little,
pink flashlight
and I'm pounding it
against the wall
so I could figure out what pills
to give her at what time.
And then after awhile,
that flashlight ??
of course, we've all
had this experience,
we ended up
throwing it away.
So I ended up
with a candle,
trying to read
all of this stuff.
Greiner: Wow.
She's, like, taking
her last breath.
Well, the end of the story
is that she survived.
I survived.
Yay!
That was the motivation
to make this unit?
It was.
That may be
the most dramatic reason
for the birth of a flashlight.
So how is yours
different
than any other flashlight
out there, or is it?
Ooh, don't get us
started on that.
Tell them.
I'm getting you started on this.
[ Laughter ]
Tell her!
Tell her!
First of all,
this is not a flashlight.
This is a solar?power,
rechargeable
light and power device
that's used around the world
in the most rugged conditions
you could possibly imagine.
Otherwise known as
a flashlight.
No.
No, it's rechargeable.
[ Laughs ]
It's a light and power device
that will keep you safe
and your
family safe.
So it's the device formerly
known as a flashlight.
You are wrong.
Greiner: It's an
emergency light.
Listen, you go down and you buy
this $20, this $10 flashlight
at your hardware store,
you bring it back,
tell me, is it going to work as
a lantern, a table lantern?
Is it gonna
be solar?powered?
No, but a $55 device might.
Gene, I don't think
that's the point.
Where my head goes with this
is, it's a flashlight,
but I think ?? Wait.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]
No!
Herjavec: Lori!
We've got to go to
the flashlight community
and ask them what they think.
Cuban: Okay, guys.
So, obviously, this is
a marketing play, right?
Because other people are
gonna say theirs is the best.
Yours is gonna
be the best.
You know, the difference is
in how you market it, right?
So tell us what
you're gonna do there.
Well, right now, of course,
we are in
30 different countries.
You are already?
That's right.
We are working with
nonprofit organizations
who use this to help
individuals
who suffer without light
and power.
O'Leary: Do you sell it
to the nonprofits?
Herjavec: Or do you give it
to them?
Well, we used to sell it
to the nonprofit,
but we changed
our business model.
Are you a charity,
or are you a business?
No, we are both.
We are a profit business.
Cuban: So, okay, you used
to sell to the NGOs.
Now you went commercial.
You want to sell these
to everyday people?
Yes.
We want to go to
brick and mortar.
Before, when our
cost was higher,
we didn't have
a comfortable margin
to get into
brick and mortar.
I would like to just get to
what you sold last year.
Last year, we sold
$53,000 worth of product.
$53,000?
Yes, sir.
And then this year,
what do you think?
$90,000.
$90,000.
So far, year?to?date, or that's
what you think you'll do?
That's what we think
we'll do.
How much have you done
year?to?date?
$36,000.
Oy.
When you started with
the NGOs in 30 countries,
when you were selling to them,
not giving it to them,
what were your sales then?
About $30,000
for the whole year.
For the whole year?
Yep. Yep.
Is there anything
proprietary in this tech?
We went on and bought every
single flashlight, lantern,
cellphone charger,
solar panel out there
and took them apart.
And we took all of the bad stuff
and we threw it out,
and we kept
the good stuff.
But, Gene, I give you credit,
you do better than anybody...
?Hang on, Mark.
...of talking around a question
and not answering it.
You tell me
what the question is.
Is there anything
proprietary?
What is proprietary,
for example, is this ??
see these little buttons
right here in the front lens?
Those are actually lenses
in there that we designed.
So you're saying
that's proprietary to you?
No, but we designed it.
The firmware, we designed.
So I feel like you're not
answering the question.
I'm not trying to be
rude to you,
but is it
proprietary or not?
Absolutely.
Explain to me what
"proprietary" means.
Meaning you own the rights to it
and nobody else can use it.
Greiner: Is it
intellectual property?
No, it's not.
Do you have a patent on it?
I don't have
a patent on it.
This product has merit,
good functionality.
It's way too expensive.
The way to make money with this
is to figure out a way
to go direct?to?consumer,
online only.
Forget retail.
$29.95.
That's probably the magic price.
There's no other way,
because you are in
an incredibly competitive space.
I think $29 ?? it might
even have to be $19.
I don't know till we test.
Mm?hmm.
But I don't need a job.
I'm ?? I'm busy.
I want you to do this ??
I want you to say "Make money."
Please say it.
Okay, "Make money."
"Make money."
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you
for your consideration.
Oh, okay.
So, guys,
you've got a great product.
Thank you.
But you've got to be able
to sell that product.
Yes.
And you haven't been able
to demonstrate yet
by your sales
or anything you've said
that you have
a path and a plan
where you're going to be able
to blow these things out, right?
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
I'm in complete agreement.
I like the product.
I think it's
a good product,
but would I pay $60 for it?
I don't think so,
and for that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
What she said.
Herjavec:
What did she say?
[ Speaking Spanish ]
"Please make sure Robert
gives us a good offer."
Keidy,
the sales are awful.
There's just a lack
of understanding
of how to get this
to the market.
You either have to be
the world's toughest torch
and go higher?end,
or be the world's best
low?end flashlight
with some features.
You're kind of
in the middle.
Gene: Mm?hmm.
You can't be in the middle.
You're gonna get crushed.
I love the product, but I
don't want to be your partner.
I want to buy
the entire company.
Whoa.
with Gene and Keidy's
business acumen,
but he does see promise in their
solar?powered light, XTorch.
I don't want to be your partner.
I want to buy
the entire company.
Whoa.
I'll give you $400,000
for 100% of the business.
But you don't have sales, Gene.
We don't have sales
because we have been timid...
Yet.
...in pursuing that
because it's just us.
We've done no marketing.
Sales is not for the timid.
Sales is a contact sport.
That's why we
need a partner.
That's why we need
a mentor to help us.
We need ??
Lubetzky: So they said
one million.
You had said
$400,000.
I can't get to a million.
I would go up
to $500,000.
Greiner: Wow.
Ohh!
It got interesting
all of a sudden.
?Seriously, Gene, this is not ??
?Well, maybe what I have to say
might help you
with your decision.
Gene: Please.
I think it's a really
good product. It's clever.
You took all the things that you
thought somebody would want,
almost like
a Swiss Army knife,
you put it all into this.
I think the problem,
for me, comes with
that there's a lot of
competition out there
that, you know, you probably
know do really big things.
Yes, but...
And they're very,
very powerful.
It's just not investable
for me. I'm sorry. I'm out.
Can we ?? Okay.
Keidy, there's nothing
proprietary.
I know.
There's no IP.
So why do you
want it, Robert?
You've done
$40,000 to $50,000 in sales.
So why would
you buy it?
I see a vision of it.
I do see a branding
exercise with it.
Gene, are you saying
no to my offer?
$750,000.
?Oh!
?Bam!
That's as low as
we would go, right there.
I'm sorry, no. There's no
way I'm going up to that!
Cuban: So what are you
gonna do, Robert?
Oh, I'm definitely out.
?Good luck, guys.
?Thank you so much.
?Good luck, guys.
?Congrats on your success.
?Okay. Bye now.
?Bye?bye. Bye. Thank you.
Lubetzky:
Good luck.
Gene: We feel like we've got
the best device in the world.
We're not ready
to just say,
"Yes, here, take our
baby away from us."
No, we wanted to be
part of the process.
We wanted to grow the company
with a mentor, with a partner.
[ Chuckles ] Whoo!
$500,000?
Are you out of your mind?
I like the product.
Like, come on.
[ Sharks laugh, scream ]
You want how much?
[ Laughter ]
