My name is Thomas Fields,
Corcoran:
Thomas, what does it retail for?
We retail right now for $1,495.
What?
$1,495?
$1,495.
Okay.
So, Thomas, tell me a little bit
about your backstory.
You wanted to be an NBA player?
Fields: Yeah, absolutely.
So I grew up always wanting to
be an NBA player
Nice.
Fields:
I was putting it all in.
Thomas, what are your sales?
We launched March 1st of 2020.
So in five months, we presold
$215,000 worth of units.
Wow.
So that was on
a Kickstarter or...
No. So, we actually launched
pure e?commerce on our website.
So what were you doing
to get people to know
about your product?
We started completely
word of mouth.
or is this preorder stuff?
Fields: This is preorders.
Everybody has paid us up front.
Okay. The product's not
in the market yet.
But how many units is that?
How many units?
125 units.
O'Leary: So, Thomas,
let me take a stab at this.
When I first saw the pitch
Greiner:
Listen, Thomas.
I think
it's a great idea.
I think it's very useful.
I'm just not a "sporty girl."
You know? So as an investment,
it's not the right one for me.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Thomas, I got to tell you,
I love your story,
about Thomas'
basketball shooting aid, Grind.
Cuban: Look, the minute
you walk out that door,
with or without a deal, I'm
gonna buy one for my backyard.
He's not here for one sale.
What are you doing, Mark?
Are you gonna make an offer?
'Cause I would like
to address it.
Such a good item, Mark.
I'm thinking
about it, yeah.
Yeah.
Thomas, I think your price point
is too high.
I think your product
is too ugly, all right?
If my neighbor put that in their
driveway, I'd kill them.
That's the truth.
I...
So I don't know what you could
do to make it look better,
but I think
it's got to look better.
We're going ?? We're going for
a very mechanical,
straightforward ??
Corcoran: Well, you've seen it.
It looks mechanical.
But I'll tell you,
I think you're a phenomenal
entrepreneur.
You got the whole package.
I would like to make you
an offer,
but I don't want to go in
without one of these
sports guys, okay?
One, because I want to use
<i>their</i> money
Fields:
Non?negotiable.
Rodriguez:
Thomas, before you decide ??
You have one of the greatest
owners of the NBA.
I mean, this is a dream offer.
Let's do ??
Let's do 25% for $300,000.
I think the valuation is ??
is great for you guys, right?
I'm gonna take it
to a $10 million company
easily in two years, right?
What do you think, Barbara?
I'll work my tail off, right?
Let's get it.
Give him a sweeter deal.
Because I have to be a Shark,
250K for the 25%.
We got ?? Let's get some ??
Let's get some breathing room.
I just did, right?
I just did.
250K for 25%.
Be careful.
Now, if you're worrying
about 50K,
then you're not
valuing us.

Thomas, what are you
gonna do?
[ Sighs ]
If you have to think about it,
Thomas...
