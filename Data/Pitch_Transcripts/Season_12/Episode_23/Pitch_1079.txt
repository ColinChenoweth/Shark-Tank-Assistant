My name is Thomas Fields,
and I'm the founder and CEO
of Grind.
Today, I'm seeking $250,000
in exchange for a 5% stake
in my company.
Now, millions of kids each year
dream of playing in the NBA.
Mark, I'm sure you were
one of them.
I was.
But whenever you get
to high school,
coaches usually expect you to
shoot up to 500 shots every day.
But usually this takes
about six hours at a time.
And good luck
trying to find somebody
to chase down your rebounds,
Mr. Wonderful.
It's not gonna happen.
That's why we created...
the Grind Machine,
the world's first
portable shooting machine
that captures your made
and missed shots,
automatically passes the ball
back out to you
and collapses down into the size
of a duffel bag
within 90 seconds.
Simply set up
our shooting machine
under any basketball goal,
and bam ??
You're ready to lock in.
Our shooting machine rotates
190 degrees,
manually passing to
five positions on the court
so you can train
like a great athlete
from anywhere along the arc.
Unlike professional machines
that are sold to the Mavericks,
Grind is made for the consumer,
being the lowest?cost machine
on the market today.
So, Sharks, who's ready to help
Grind develop interactive,
game?changing products
one sport at a time?
Mark, you want to try it?
Cuban: Yeah. Love to.
Now, it's powered
by pneumatics, right?
So this is a completely new way
of passing the ball out.
So if you could stand, like,
right there.
Okay.
That's about right.
Corcoran:
Thomas, what does it retail for?
We retail right now for $1,495.
What?
$1,495?
$1,495.
Okay.
So, Thomas, tell me a little bit
about your backstory.
You wanted to be an NBA player?
Fields: Yeah, absolutely.
So I grew up always wanting to
be an NBA player
and ultimately get my family
to a better means, right?
Growing up,
I saw my mom and my dad
always working 5:00 a. m. jobs,
night?shift jobs.
So my goal was to get
a D?1 scholarship, right,
and go to the NBA,
just like all the other kids.
Well, I blew out my ACL
four times...
Ooh.
...before graduating
high school.
Wow.
Rodriguez: Wow.
And I soon realized
that that dream
of getting to that next level
was not gonna happen.
And throughout
this whole process,
I realized that I was knocking
on the door at the gym
at 5:00 in the morning,
trying to use
the shooting machine
that my school purchased
that was $6,000, right,
and 400 pounds.
And I couldn't get in the gym.
It wasn't accessible to me
at the time, right?
I tried to buy one
for our house,
and it was like five, six grand.
So there was no way my family
was purchasing one.
And at that point, I realized
that these companies are really
overlooking the market.
So we came into the market
for $1,495,
and we're the first company
that started payment?plan
solutions for individuals.
How much money did you put into
it to get it up off the ground?
$15,000.
And how did you earn
that $15,000, Thomas?
YMCA. Shoveling mud.
Everything that you can
think of, like ??
Nice.
Fields:
I was putting it all in.
Thomas, what are your sales?
We launched March 1st of 2020.
So in five months, we presold
$215,000 worth of units.
Wow.
So that was on
a Kickstarter or...
No. So, we actually launched
pure e?commerce on our website.
So what were you doing
to get people to know
about your product?
We started completely
word of mouth.
And as you know, in basketball,
it's a community
where if somebody says something
or there's a video out about it,
it goes pretty viral, right?
Right, so all the kids
on Instagram
who are shooting, right,
they put this
into an Instagram video
to show
how they're working out.
All the kids that watch that
think, "Okay.
If they're using it,
then it's cool for me."
Exactly. Exactly.
O'Leary: I'm not clear.
Have they actually been shipped
and are being used,
or is this preorder stuff?
Fields: This is preorders.
Everybody has paid us up front.
Okay. The product's not
in the market yet.
But how many units is that?
How many units?
125 units.
And not one
has been delivered yet?
Right.
This is our testing unit.
We've gotten here with $215,000
in sales through a pandemic
with no working capital,
all with one unit.
What's it cost you
to make a unit?
$977.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
Right.
So we have roughly 35% margins.
We think that at scale,
we could bring that margin down.
Cuban:
And what about power?
If I take it to the park
and just want to shoot,
what about power?
Yeah. Yeah.
So how long
does the power last?
It does need to be plugged in,
but version two,
that's exactly what we're on.
Okay.
So that's a challenge, right?
Yeah.
That makes it more
for the backyard
or the bucket you have
in your driveway.
Yep.
Right?
And it really doesn't help you
in terms of going to the park.
Some parks
actually do have outlets.
Have power?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You'd be surprised how many do.
Look, I go out
and I still shoot, right?
'Cause of quarantine, right?
That's how I clear my head.
It sure didn't show
in shooting those baskets.
Yeah. Trust me.
That should clutter
your head.
I can shoot.
But, you know...
There are other options
that are low cost, right?
So, there's just the metal rack
that just, you know...
Yeah.
...if you're
just shooting
and it just rolls right back
to you, that costs a lot less.
Now, every basketball player
will tell you they hate that.
Well, yeah, but I like $1,500
more than I hate...
Mark, what do you guys have
with the Mavericks?
Yeah.
It's a whole different level.
So, let me give you
the comparison, right?
So, if you're outside
shooting by yourself,
it's gonna take about six hours
to get up to 500 shots in,
right?
Versus our machine,
you can do that within an hour.
O'Leary: So, Thomas,
let me take a stab at this.
When I first saw the pitch
and watched Mark miss basket
after basket,
I thought to myself,
"You know,
this is a crazy idea
without any merit."
But the more I heard the story
and the fact
that you actually sold
over $200,000 worth of them,
that is more impressive.
This isn't a product for me,
though,
but we do have a token NBA owner
we keep on the side
here at "Shark Tank."
But I applaud you.
This is a cool product.
Means a lot coming from you.
But I'm out.
Greiner:
Listen, Thomas.
I think
it's a great idea.
I think it's very useful.
I'm just not a "sporty girl."
You know? So as an investment,
it's not the right one for me.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Thomas, I got to tell you,
I love your story,
and it's so inspiring.
It reminds me
of when I grew up.
A kid from
the Boys and Girls Club ??
I think it's fantastic.
I love the name Grind.
I love your grit.
For me,
I'm having a problem
with those margins
and the price.
For those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Look, the challenge is
right now, one, the valuation.
Okay. Yeah.
Right?
Two, your margins and how many
you can actually make
and how many
you can actually sell.
Yeah.
I love the, you know,
just grinding all your life.
That's who you are.
Absolutely.
And I respect that.
What you've been able
to accomplish is awesome.
Um, I'm just...
Yeah, let's negotiate, Mark.
Let's ?? Let's figure this out.
Because I think this
can easily go to a $5 million
to $10 million company.
I'm not sure.
That's the question.
I'm not sure of that.
Right?
I?I am.
No entrepreneur doesn't
think so, right?
I got you.
You know?
Absolutely.
You know, it's kind of scary
to sit next to him,
and he's not sure, and he's not
buying, and I'm wondering ??
No. No.
Let me just tell you.
The minute you walk out that
door, with or without a deal,
I'm gonna buy one
for my backyard.
He's not here for one sale.
What are you doing, Mark?
[ Suspenseful music plays ]
Narrator: Three Sharks are out,
and Mark is undecided
about Thomas'
basketball shooting aid, Grind.
Cuban: Look, the minute
you walk out that door,
with or without a deal, I'm
gonna buy one for my backyard.
He's not here for one sale.
What are you doing, Mark?
Are you gonna make an offer?
'Cause I would like
to address it.
Such a good item, Mark.
I'm thinking
about it, yeah.
Yeah.
Thomas, I think your price point
is too high.
I think your product
is too ugly, all right?
If my neighbor put that in their
driveway, I'd kill them.
That's the truth.
I...
So I don't know what you could
do to make it look better,
but I think
it's got to look better.
We're going ?? We're going for
a very mechanical,
straightforward ??
Corcoran: Well, you've seen it.
It looks mechanical.
But I'll tell you,
I think you're a phenomenal
entrepreneur.
You got the whole package.
I would like to make you
an offer,
but I don't want to go in
without one of these
sports guys, okay?
One, because I want to use
<i>their</i> money
and two, because they know
what they're doing
in the sports field and I don't.
So I'm anxious to see if...
So, what do you have in mind,
Barbara?
So I'm thinking I would offer
$250,000 for 20%.
It's not enough.
You don't think
that's enough?
Yeah. It's not enough.
Oh, then I agree
with my partner here, Mark.
He's gonna ask you
for more.
What are you thinking, Mark?
So if there's two of us,
30%.
Okay.
I'll go with you.
I like your deal better.
So for two of us ??
'Cause ?? Let me just tell you.
And I know you think
it's a lot,
you know,
but it's not.
Period, end of story,
right?
Because Barbara's skill set
is her people skills.
And her ability
with the marketing and packaging
are better than mine.
I'm gonna make you pretty.
Yeah.
She'll make it pretty.
Let's do it.
So 250K for 30%.
I have a cap on myself, right?
So ??
That's up to you.
'Cause it's
non?negotiable.
Fields:
Non?negotiable.
Rodriguez:
Thomas, before you decide ??
You have one of the greatest
owners of the NBA.
I mean, this is a dream offer.
Let's do ??
Let's do 25% for $300,000.
I think the valuation is ??
is great for you guys, right?
I'm gonna take it
to a $10 million company
easily in two years, right?
What do you think, Barbara?
I'll work my tail off, right?
Let's get it.
Give him a sweeter deal.
Because I have to be a Shark,
250K for the 25%.
We got ?? Let's get some ??
Let's get some breathing room.
I just did, right?
I just did.
250K for 25%.
Be careful.
Now, if you're worrying
about 50K,
then you're not
valuing us.
[ Suspenseful music plays ]
Thomas, what are you
gonna do?
[ Sighs ]
If you have to think about it,
Thomas...
Fields: Man, I'm excited
about having Mark and Barbara.
I think we're gonna change
the world.
If you have a dream and you see
me up here making deals,
like, you can go do it
no matter where you're from.
