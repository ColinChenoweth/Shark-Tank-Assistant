I'm Karen Nation
from Los Angeles, California,
with Creation Nation,
Creation Nation is leading
a DIY snack revolution.
How come there's
no national rollouts?
Nation: Yeah, so ??
We haven't gone national yet,
so we're still
in less than 500 stores.
What does it cost me
to buy this?
What does it cost you
to make it?
Nation:
So, it's $2.00 to $3.50,
depending on which product,
to make it.
Karen, why were you in
the foster?care system,
Well, Karen,
you still have two Sharks in.
Barbara, do you like this
at all?
Corcoran: Karen, Mark wants me
to go in on this deal,
but there's no money
in it.
Yeah.
Karen, I wish ??
I'm trying to get there,
but I just can't.
The real product here
is fun,
but that's going to be
a lot of work.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
Congrats, Karen.
Congrats.
Terrific.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Hey, Karen.
I didn't want you to leave
here ?? I hope you don't mind.
I didn't want you to leave here
thinking that you failed.
