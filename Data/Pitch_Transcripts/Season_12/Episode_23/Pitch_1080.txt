I'm Karen Nation
from Los Angeles, California,
and I'm here seeking $300,000
for 12% equity in my company.
I've dedicated my life
to nutrition
and found that people
really want to take back control
over what they put in their
bodies for healthier lives.
But when it comes to snacking
on nutrition bars,
the problem is there's way
too much sugar, preservatives,
poor?quality ingredients.
And let's be honest.
They often taste unnatural.
So instead of eating expensive
candy bars in disguise,
I started making healthy,
homemade protein bites.
Sharks, I've reinvented
the snack game
with Creation Nation,
the world's first protein bar
and bite mixes.
It's no?bake,
easy as a protein shake,
and even fun for kids to make.
Here's how it works.
Start by pouring
any of our mixes into a bowl.
Add your choice of liquid
to the mix,
then your favorite nut butter
or syrup.
One of the best parts
is you control the sugar.
So whether you're keto, paleo,
vegan, or gluten free,
personalizing your snack
is as easy as one, two, three.
All that's left to do is mix.
And then you're gonna roll...
...and take a bite.
That's cool.
Creation Nation is leading
a DIY snack revolution.
So who's ready to raise the bar
with me and have a ball?
Wow.
Rodriguez: Wow.
So, the ones on your left
were made keto style,
with just almond butter.
The energy bite mixes, we made
with peanut butter and honey.
Except for yours, Lori. There's
no peanut butter in yours.
Thank you.
Mark, all of yours
are our vegan mixes.
Cool.
And how much protein?
It's between 12
to 16 grams of protein
for a full?size bar
or about five grams of protein
per ball.
Rodriguez:
They're very good.
They're actually
really good.
Very tasty.
So, how has the market
received this?
How are you selling?
So, we sell online.
One of our first retail partners
was one of the big
e?commerce sellers.
Now we're also in Whole Foods
Market on the West Coast,
Costco in the Midwest,
and Walmart on the East Coast.
O'Leary:
Are these regional tests?
How come there's
no national rollouts?
Nation: Yeah, so ??
We haven't gone national yet,
so we're still
in less than 500 stores.
What does it cost me
to buy this?
What does it cost you
to make it?
Nation:
So, it's $2.00 to $3.50,
depending on which product,
to make it.
And they retail between $7.00
and $11.00.
I'm wondering ?? How did you
come up with this concept?
Well, I've really been obsessed
with nutrition
since I was a kid.
I spent some years
in the foster?care system,
and the families really couldn't
accommodate my food allergies.
So I just didn't eat
or I ate a candy bar,
and I was constantly falling
asleep in class or always sick.
But I am
a very determined person,
and I pretty much self?studied
my way to health
and later became certified
in sports nutrition.
Karen, why were you in
the foster?care system,
and what was that like?
Well, um...
Well, yeah.
Family life at that time
wasn't a good situation,
so the courts decided
it was safer for me
to live in foster care.
The families were nice,
but it's, you know,
it's not your family.
It's not your home.
No. Of course.
It's definitely
very different.
One of the many jobs I held ??
I was a house mother
for 14 children
in foster care.
And I had that job
for about a year and a half.
Wow.
And these kids developed
such a sense of value
that changed them forever.
You learn a lot
through that.
You learn to care for yourself,
I think.
Mm?hmm.
What's revenue going to be
this calendar year?
At least $500,000.
We did $500,000 last year,
and we're set to do
at least that or more.
Well, you would hope you'd grow
year over year.
Was there any profits?
We're pretty much break even
all the time.
We run on cash flow.
Cuban: Are there other
no?bake products?
No.
The question then becomes
why haven't you sold more?
Yeah.
What's holding you back?
We went to trade shows,
and we had all this interest,
all this momentum.
We hit a major
co?packer problem.
They breached our contract
in a variety of ways.
I had very specific stipulations
about the shelf life
of the ingredient they were
putting in our product.
They didn't follow that.
So in other words, they
didn't follow your instruction,
you shipped out a bunch
with the ??
let's call it
tainted product.
Correct.
And what happened?
So, we did a lot
of withdrawals.
It was just not
to our quality standards.
I pivoted quickly.
I got a new co?packer
we've now been with
for a year and a half,
and they've been amazing.
By the end of last year,
we were doing great.
And then with COVID,
things kind of changed. Um ??
So I pivoted again.
Why wouldn't this be
a great product for home
at COVID?
Yes.
So I pivoted our strategy
to e?commerce,
and we've tripled our sales.
Wow. Good for you.
Rodriguez: Wow.
Last month, how much did you do
from wholesale?
We're about a 50/50 model
right now.
Just last month.
Last month.
I don't know the number off
the top of my head. I'm sorry.
Did you guys make money
last month?
Absolutely.
Yes.
We made about a total
of $30,000.
Good for you.
And what do you expect to make
by year end?
I'm expecting to do
at least $500,000.
We've already done $330,000 ??
Money that you can take
as profit in your pocket.
Money you could put
in your pocket
and say, "Hey,
I got this money out."
If you're gonna sell $500,000 ??
Not sales.
Not sales, but profits.
If you sell $500,000,
what will you have in the bank?
I?I put the money
back into the business.
I mean, our margins are 40%
to 50%.
This is a basic question
in investing.
You're gonna sell $500,000 worth
of this stuff.
Are you going to profit
from that enterprise?
No. No. We ??
Everything that we profit ??
Took me a long time
to get that out of you.
I run a very lean business.
She's not answering.
Everything that we make,
we put back into marketing.
Listen. If you don't know what
the definition of profit is,
you're in the wrong place,
okay?
I...
I'm out.
Well, listen.
I like healthier food.
But sometimes I just go
with my gut.
I like the product.
I like you.
But I don't think it's
the right investment for me.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.
I really like your mission.
I like everything you stand for.
Your story is really amazing
and aspirational.
But when I look to invest
in a business,
I look for someone to know
the numbers inside and out.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Well, Karen,
you still have two Sharks in.
Barbara, do you like this
at all?
Barbara and Mark.
I love the product.
And just a piece of advice.
What frightens me ??
If I'm gonna write you a check
for $300,000...
It's too high a price.
...and you're not remembering
the numbers,
that scares me.
Corcoran: Karen, Mark wants me
to go in on this deal,
but there's no money
in it.
And that's a basic requirement
I have for investing.
We have great margins.
Like ??
But it doesn't find its way
into your pocket eventually
over the years so far.
I?I must be missing
something basic, but I'm out.
This is a pantry staple
that bridges the gap
between nutritional powders
and grocery products ??
Yeah.
Karen, I wish ??
I'm trying to get there,
but I just can't.
The real product here
is fun,
but that's going to be
a lot of work.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
Congrats, Karen.
Congrats.
Terrific.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Hey, Karen.
I didn't want you to leave
here ?? I hope you don't mind.
I didn't want you to leave here
thinking that you failed.
Thank you.
That you were able to stand up
to everybody was remarkable.
You've held your cool,
and you knew your numbers,
and we just rolled out
nationwide ?? 2,800 stores.
Who was that retailer?
O'Leary:
And that was after how long?
That's Walmart.
How long did they test it for?
They tested it
for about four or five months.
It was just higher
than the buyers' expectations.
And we didn't know anything.
Neither of us are entrepreneurs.
We didn't have any experience
bringing a product to market.
We didn't know anything
about manufacturing.
We didn't know anything
about distribution
or how even
to do packaging.
So what is your story?
How did you learn?
The Internet.
And we just work our butts off
until we figure things out.
How much money have you invested
in the business?
I put my house behind it.
So I have a home?equity
line of credit worth $300,000
that we've used to finance
these orders.
Greiner: Wow.
You are all?in.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Hey, but we're debt free
as of last week.
We have no debt.
That's the big news.
You paid it down?
As of last week,
we are completely
debt free.
Rodriguez:
Nice job. Nice.
And we have some cash
in the bank.
What are your sales to date?
2019, we finished the year
at $202,000.
Wow.
Good for you.
And this year,
what do you think you'll do?
Year to date,
we're over $1.1 million...
What?!
...and we expect to do
$1.8 million.
Oh, my gosh.
Greiner: Wait.
So, I mean ??
You know, that's a jump.
Our e?commerce is about 12%
of our business.
We started putting focus
into that this year,
and already it's growing
exponentially,
matching
our retail business.
When we put money
into Amazon ads,
our total sales by month are
three times our ad spend.
