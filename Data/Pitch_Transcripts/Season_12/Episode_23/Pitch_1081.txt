made a deal with Kevin O'Leary
for their portable
oxygen canisters, Boost Oxygen.
We'll take the deal.
Herjavec: Lovely.
Let's see
what they're up to now.
Grice:
Boost Oxygen provides
nearly five times
the concentration of oxygen
than the air
that we're normally breathing.
Whether you're a senior citizen,
whether you're exercising,
whether you're an athlete,
we can all benefit
from the use
of supplemental oxygen.
The year that we pitched
the Sharks,
we did $6.4 million
in sales.
contrary to what Kevin
was saying.
I do.
So you should be walking
out of here
totally proud
of who you are.
Thank you, Barbara.
I really appreciate that.
I've worked really hard.
Because you're gonna inspire
everybody
who's watching the show.
You're gonna be shocked
at the inspiration
you're gonna provide people.
Okay.
Thank you, Barbara.
Yeah. Okay.
So walk out of here proud.
So great to meet you.
Having a Shark on my team
meant so much to me,
so I'm disappointed
that didn't happen.
Hi, Sharks. I'm Chris Pavlica
from Elmore, Ohio.
Pavlica: This is a unique
dual?sided sponge
Chris, what is your competition?
In terms of removing
scuff marks,
there are bulky brush kits
that are not very convenient.
You can't put them
in your pocket.
Spray foam.
They go everywhere.
Yeah. They're messy.
Fortunately, we do have
five different patents pending
across our line,
Kevin has offered $200,000
for 15%.
[ Laughs ]
Pavlica: It seems crazy to pass
up an offer from Mark Cuban,
I mean, it's craft beer, Kevin.
You get a gallon of beer
as a result.
Okay, I guess it <i>is</i> worth
$25 million.
So, before we jump into
the valuation question,
do you guys want to drink
some beer?
We promise.
We'll get there.
We'll get there, Kevin.
Now we're on Chubby.
Kevin, they named this one
after you.
That's the Chubby Stout.
That's the Chubby Stout.
I really like this one.
Guys, how did you get into
the business in the first place?
Kevin.
O'Leary:
I'm a reasonable man...
[ Laughs ]
Rodriguez: So, Kevin,
let me give it a crack.
