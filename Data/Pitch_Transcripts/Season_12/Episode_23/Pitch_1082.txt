made a deal with Kevin O'Leary
for their portable
oxygen canisters, Boost Oxygen.
We'll take the deal.
Herjavec: Lovely.
Let's see
what they're up to now.
Grice:
Boost Oxygen provides
nearly five times
the concentration of oxygen
than the air
that we're normally breathing.
Whether you're a senior citizen,
whether you're exercising,
whether you're an athlete,
we can all benefit
from the use
of supplemental oxygen.
The year that we pitched
the Sharks,
we did $6.4 million
in sales.
It's been less than a year
and a half since we aired,
and we've done
over $15 million in sales.
We've doubled, from 4,000
to over 8,000 locations,
where Boost Oxygen
is available ??
Big 5 Sporting Goods,
Dick's Sporting Goods,
Kroger grocery stores,
Walgreens,
all the way down to those
individual mom?and?pop retailers
who recognize the value
of our brand
that they can bring
to their local consumers.
I used to drink coffee
in the afternoons.
Now in the afternoon...
[ Air hisses ]
...I Boost.
O'Leary: Boost Oxygen
is one of those deals
that you say to yourself,
"Why didn't I think of that?"
People have learned about it
all across America.
The brand is becoming
one of the best out there
in terms of helping athletes,
helping hikers,
helping people that work out.
I see this company being huge
in two years.
Look, we should all take
a moment and smell the roses.
Or better still, take a boost.
[ Both laugh ]
[ Air hisses ]
Neuner: Boost Oxygen
was started 14 years ago
in Bridgeport,
Connecticut.
And when the pandemic hit,
Bridgeport, being an inner city,
closed their schools,
and a lot of the school?aged
children lost their access
to proper nutrition
during the day.
We wanted to help,
so we donated
to Connecticut Food Bank
of Bridgeport
to help provide meals
to the needy.
It's really inspirational
to be able to reach people
with a product
that didn't exist 14 years ago
and the millions of people
that now know about it
and rely on it
on a daily basis.
We're on the leading edge
of bringing
an entirely new idea forward,
and we're helping millions
of people as we do so.
[ Air hissing ]
contrary to what Kevin
was saying.
I do.
So you should be walking
out of here
totally proud
of who you are.
Thank you, Barbara.
I really appreciate that.
I've worked really hard.
Because you're gonna inspire
everybody
who's watching the show.
You're gonna be shocked
at the inspiration
you're gonna provide people.
Okay.
Thank you, Barbara.
Yeah. Okay.
So walk out of here proud.
So great to meet you.
Having a Shark on my team
meant so much to me,
so I'm disappointed
that didn't happen.
But I'm just gonna keep going
and...
just keep going.
[ Laughs ]
[ Dramatic music plays ]
Narrator:
Next up is a better way
to keep your prized kicks
looking their best.
Hi, Sharks. I'm Chris Pavlica
from Elmore, Ohio.
And I'm Kevin Consolo
from Chagrin Falls, Ohio.
And we're
the creators of...
...SneakErasers.
...SneakErasers.
We're here
seeking $200,000
in exchange for 8%
of our business.
As we all know,
it's important to look good.
Barbara knows exactly
what we're talking about.
I like what you're talkin'.
[ Laughter ]
And for many, looking good
starts with their shoes.
That's right, Sharks.
People love the look of shoes
with new white midsoles.
But they're impossible
to keep clean!
We swear if you just look
at them wrong, they get dirty.
The second you leave the house
and step outside ??
Not the driveway! ??
You already
scuffed them up.
Or on a rainy day ??
Watch out for that...mud puddle.
So unless you want to wear
a plastic bag over your shoes,
no one can tiptoe around
these elements
and avoid these disasters.
We knew there just had to be
a better way,
which is why we created...
SneakErasers.
Pavlica: This is a unique
dual?sided sponge
engineered and designed
specifically for shoes.
You just tear open the pouch,
pull out the sponge,
and use the white side
to easily remove
all the scuff marks and dirt
and flip it over to the
orange side to wipe it clean.
And best of all,
it's premoistened,
so you can touch up your kicks
wherever you go.
And it works on all kinds
of shoes ?? sneakers...
casual shoes...
sports cleats...
kids' shoes ??
Okay. All right. All right.
You guys get the point.
So take these bad boys
with you
in your purse, your carry?on,
your computer bag ??
wherever you want to keep
your favorite pair
looking like new,
like before a job interview.
Or like before going
on a hot date.
Like with you, Barbara.
[ Laughter ]
So, who wants to kick it with us
and make millions?
Oh. I like that part.
Greiner:
Good job.
How many shoes
will one of these do?
It depends on the shoe.
We've gotten
up to like nine pairs.
No water needed?
Oh, no water needed. Yeah.
And that's
what really separates us.
What does the orange do?
The orange part is
a super?soft chamois.
So it works on any delicate or
sensitive materials on the shoe.
And it also wipes away
just like a pencil eraser.
If you left any shavings behind,
it just wipes it clean.
Well, I have good news for you,
boys ?? It works.
Oh, good. Good.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, it does work.
What do you sell the three?packs
for, and what does it cost you?
The three?pack sells for $9.99,
and our cost is $1.98.
We do sell
the one?count
in one of the largest retailers
in America ??
that display right there ??
and that's $3.99 MSRP.
How are the sales?
We have a lot of tests
that have gone very well.
For instance, that one retailer
started on a 100?store test,
Chris, what is your competition?
In terms of removing
scuff marks,
there are bulky brush kits
that are not very convenient.
You can't put them
in your pocket.
Spray foam.
They go everywhere.
Yeah. They're messy.
Fortunately, we do have
five different patents pending
across our line,
and we have been
knocked off once.
By us.
By our own product.
[ Laughter ]
So we made an economy line
and a premium line.
And what's the difference?
The big difference
are the pre?moistened.
So, this is dry.
The user has to add water to it.
The density is different.
This has a scouring pad,
not a soft chamois.
You know, that's sold at dollar
and discount stores.
And we've sold 2.2 million units
of that already since October.
If I look at the two
beside each other,
do I know they're
the same company?
No.
No.
This is Shoe Eraser, and our
premium brand is SneakErasers.
Well, good for you.
That's a first
in "Shark Tank" history.
I've never seen anybody
knock themselves off.
Thank you. Thank you.
Look, I like this story
'cause it's got sales, okay?
What I am surprised to hear
is that you're only 12% digital,
which is crazy
for a product like this.
This should be
50% direct to customer.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you $200,000 for 15%.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.
We're flattered
that you would give us an offer.
Appreciate it.
That's a little bit
more equity
than we want to give up
at this moment.
I think my name is a Shark.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Was that a no?
Guys, that there is a lot
to like here.
Thank you.
I wore cleats
for almost 25 years.
And there's nothing worse
than using your metal cleats
and have them be dirty, right?
It's a thing of pride.
That's something that
George Steinbrenner taught us.
Always make sure you shave,
cut your hair,
and clean your shoes, right?
But when I think about goals
and dreams, I like clarity.
What can we do for you
to take you from good to great?
It's about taking the skills
that you've already perfected
with advertising
and marketing.
Having that investment will
help us take our costs down
to increase our margins.
But it's also going to help us
launch our other brands.
So Golf Erasers
is already
our number?one?selling
e?commerce item.
But it is to clean
golf club faces in between shots
and clean your shoes.
Oh, the face as well.
We want to tell you
about Auto Erasers, as well.
Auto Erasers is an instant
detailing sponge.
So, these are
already carried
in some of the largest retailers
in their sector.
When you were giving us
your sales numbers,
were they included,
or is that separate?
Yes. Yeah.
They are included.
All part of the company.
They're still only 5%
of our business.
When you came in here,
I got a little excited.
I saw a single product
that was selling like crazy,
two guys that had all the
skill sets to make it happen,
and then you started talking
about this other stuff.
And I realized
what I really have here
is guys who are inventors.
I'm never crazy about inventors
because the money
you make on this,
you lose on that.
You're all over the board.
I'm out.
Hey, Barbara,
thank you so much.
Greiner: Listen.
I think exactly...
Don't get discouraged.
Don't get discouraged.
...the opposite.
Thank you.
Because inventors
are the lifeblood
of innovation and products.
I've created over 800 on my own.
Brand extension's everything.
You get them to your website.
You have other things to offer.
You're just gonna add sales.
These aren't extensions.
They're whole other markets.
That's what's wrong.
Greiner:
So I like that you're inventors
and you also proved
that you're marketers.
O'Leary: And?
So you can do both.
Thank you.
So Alex and I were talking.
Yes.
And we were thinking
that we are going to give you
an offer together.
So it will be Alex and I
together.
It's going to be $200,000
for both of us but 20%.
Ouch.
Ichi?ay caramba!
Thank you for your offer.
Because you got to make us
want to get out of bed
and go, "Hey. Let's get crackin'
on SneakErasers."
I understand.
All of a sudden,
the Mr. Wonderful offer
looks really attractive.
[ Laughing ] Yes.
Greiner: Not to us.
But what you need
is instant credibility,
and you need visibility.
Lori and I make a good team.
She takes care of e?commerce.
I take care of bricks
and mortar.
And we want to put you
in over 500 gyms...
Wow.
...day one.
Wow.
That's what we want to do
to get you started.
And then...
And I'll help you with, like,
the retail end
of the sporting?goods stores.
I feel like you need to
blitz the market,
because you have a great
trademark, logo, and name.
Okay, Lori.
Let them make a decision here.
You've got two great offers.
And, Mark,
are you gonna do anything?
Say what?
Are you in or are you out?
Oh, I get to
ask questions now?
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: No.
Cuban: All right, guys.
Guys, look.
What does it cost you
just to make one of these?
Costs 59 cents.
Okay.
So ?? And could you do one
with custom packaging?
Yes.
Yes. Of course.
Private label.
So if I wanted to offer one to
Mavs fans under the age of 20...
Absolutely.
...or if I wanted to
call up Nike
and say this should be bundled
and we can get it down
to 75 cents or whatever.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I'll make you an offer.
The $200,000 and I want 12.5%.
Okay.
But it's right now.
Thank you for this offer.
Greiner: No.
If you think that's right
and the right strategy ??
You got 20% or 12%
with a guaranteed customer.
That's not the right strategy
for you guys.
Narrator:
One Shark is out.
Chris and Kevin have
three offers on the table
for their shoe?cleaning company,
SneakErasers.
Kevin has offered $200,000
for 15%.
[ Laughs ]
Lori and Alex have offered
$200,000 for 20%,
and Mark has offered $200,000
for 12.5% of the company.
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
[ Suspenseful music plays ]
Okay. Sorry.
Sorry about that.
[ Whispering
indistinctly ]
Mark, would you up it
to $300,000 for 10%?
$300,000 for 10%?
Rodriguez: Wow.
I'm out, guys.
Corcoran: Wow.
Wise guy.
Who's the Shark now?
Guys, I'm not gonna do it
for less than 15%.
That's 20%.
What do you guys want to do?
Rodriguez: So, Lori, our offer
has to appear much nicer now,
now that Mark's out.
Well, our offer should have
appeared really nice
to begin with.
It <i>is</i> a fantastic offer.
Can you remind me
what your offer is? I'm sorry.
[ Laughter ]
I'm so sorry.
Cuban: Yeah!
I'm so sorry.
Greiner: You forgot?
Is he always like this
when he gets nervous?
[ Laughing ] No.
Rodriguez: Here's our offer.
It's $200,000 for 20%.
O'Leary:
So you guys have a huge delta
between what your perceived
value is
and what Sharks think
you're worth.
Yeah.
We love the two Sharks.
Would you guys be willing
to come down in equity at all?
We thought 8% was a lot.
Would you bring it down at all?
No.
And I'll say this last thing,
because I'm about to take it
off the table.
We'll take it.
We'll take your deal.
[ Gasps, laughs ]
Corcoran: Wow.
Thank you.
Boom!
Oh. Well, boom.
Mark, we are so sorry.
Corcoran:
Closing line. [ Laughs ]
Cuban:
Congratulations, guys.
Greiner:
Congrats, guys.
Congrats. Great job, guys.
Aww.
Way to go, buddy.
Pavlica: It seems crazy to pass
up an offer from Mark Cuban,
but on the other hand, two
Sharks were going in together.
And it's exactly
what we needed ??
a professional athlete
who everyone knows
and Lori,
who does everything that we need
to take us
to the next level.
It's just impossible
to pass up the both of them.
I mean, it's craft beer, Kevin.
You get a gallon of beer
as a result.
Okay, I guess it <i>is</i> worth
$25 million.
So, before we jump into
the valuation question,
do you guys want to drink
some beer?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
And ?? And another question.
How many beers will you get
out of it?
So, BeerMKR makes
a 12?pack of beer.
And the MKR Kits themselves
cost $15.
Hall:
So starting at the lightest ??
That's our Future IPA.
It has a little bite to it.
It does.
I like it.
Thank you.
So the next up,
we have our Ghost Wheat,
which is a classic
American?style wheat beer.
So, next up,
we have our Redwood IPA,
and that's a classic
West Coast?style IPA.
I'm gonna give this IPA
a 9 out of 10.
Pretty good.
Awesome. Thank you.
Awesome. Thank you.
And the only reason
it's not a 10
is the arrogance
of your valuation.
We'll get to
the arrogance.
We promise.
We'll get there.
We'll get there, Kevin.
Now we're on Chubby.
Kevin, they named this one
after you.
That's the Chubby Stout.
That's the Chubby Stout.
I really like this one.
Guys, how did you get into
the business in the first place?
So, first and foremost,
we love beer.
I was a home brewer
for 15 years.
And, you know, honestly,
we met at Cornell.
Kevin.
O'Leary:
I'm a reasonable man...
[ Laughs ]
We love you,
Mr. Wonderful.
...and I like to give,
particularly for entrepreneurs,
that at the end of the day,
the product is excellent.
You have not heard anybody say
this beer isn't great.
Absolutely.
And I consider myself
a connoisseur
of all things
with alcohol in them.
[ Chuckles ]
My inner instinct
is to eviscerate you.
But I'm not gonna do that
because ??
We appreciate that.
I think it's so interesting.
So how do I encapsulate
this ridiculous valuation
but still be a partner
with you?
Royalties!
Now, let me show you
how to do it.
No royalty at all.
No royalty.
Okay. Okay.
I just take what I do in the
wine business and apply it here.
$500,000.
It's debt.
I'll do it at 9%.
Told you.
36 months straight debt,
which you can afford if you
believe your numbers, okay?
And I want 4% equity.
You can figure out ??
Stay out of the cap table.
That's not a bad deal.
Give them to me
as advisory shares.
I would do that deal, and you
should seriously consider it,
because you're not gonna get
a deal from anybody else.
There's an offer.
What do you want to do?
Well, would you be able to go
for 2% with the debt?
I'll do it at 3%.
I'll meet you in the middle.
[ Suspenseful music plays ]
I have an MBA, too,
unfortunately.
We're really worried about
the working?capital implications
of that.
I don't want to fight with you
about valuation.
We're never going to agree.
Rodriguez: So, Kevin,
let me give it a crack.
$500,000 and 9%
is $3,750 a month.
You guys feel
you can cover that?
That's not a lot of money.
Rodriguez:
That's nothing, right?
We ?? Yeah.
We could cover that.
The problem, though, is after
we're done paying that back,
we'd have had to pay back
$500,000
plus 9% over three years.
Yeah. That's why ??
Yes.
Right, in which case, it's ??
We're still now ??
But you have a partner
that millions of people know
and trust in these beverages.
If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.
