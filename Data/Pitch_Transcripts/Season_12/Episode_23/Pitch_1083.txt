Vegas: Before we jump
into the valuation,
do you guys want to drink
some beer?
Yes.
Yes.
Hey, Sharks.
I'm Aaron.
And I'm Brett, and we're
from Boulder, Colorado.
We are asking for $500,000
for 2% in our company.
Ouch.
Wow.
Who doesn't love sipping
on an ice?cold craft beer?
Am I right?
But the reason
why beer lovers everywhere
aren't making their own beer
at home
is 'cause it's not as easy
as it looks.
No. It takes tons of time,
experience, expertise.
And the worst part is
you can spend weeks
on a single batch of beer
and it can come out terrible.
That's why we've revolutionized
the craft?beer?making process,
taking home brewing
out of the basement
and turning beer lovers
into beer makers.
Introducing...
BeerMKR.
...BeerMKR.
This is the world's first
all?in?one
countertop
craft?brewing appliance
that anybody can use.
Wow.
All right, Sharks.
Aaron and I are gonna quickly
walk you through a demo
of this product just to show you
how easy it is to use.
First thing you do
is you take your MKR Kit.
You connect the bag
into the machine,
open it all up,
pour in your grain.
The next step you do
is basically fill the entire
machine up with water,
close it all,
press the button on the front.
And over the next 24 hours,
BeerMKR is going to bring up the
temperature inside the machine,
mashing those grains and liquid
and creating wort,
which is a sugary liquid.
Next, you get a notification
on your phone,
and it says,
"It's time to put your yeast."
So open the machine
back up.
You pull out that basket
of spent grain.
You then put in your yeast,
you put in your hops,
close the machine back up,
press the button on the front.
And again, over the next five
to seven days,
BeerMKR is going to perfectly
control the pressure
and temperature
inside the unit.
Finally,
when that process is complete,
you get
another notification
saying it's time
to tap your beer.
So you remove the bag
of clean fermented beer,
bring it over
to your beer tap,
which is included
in the package,
simply install the bag of beer
inside the beer tap,
screw in the CO2 cartridge that
comes inside your MKR Kit.
And about a day later, you're
drinking cold, carbonated,
fresh, delicious craft beer
that you made yourself.
Corcoran:
Wow.
It was nine days
till I got a beer, right?
It depends on the recipe.
So each different type ??
Do you see any problem
with that?
Rodriguez: No.
Greiner: Y?? No.
No.
Brett and I were in
the business school together,
and we started the company
in an entrepreneurship class
at Cornell.
And it was for home?brewing
temperature?control devices.
You're Cornell MBAs?
Yes, sir.
Correct.
So break down the numbers
for me.
Sure.
So this costs us $375 to make.
And it retails for $499.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
It cost you $375 for all?in,
all the pieces...
Yep.
...including a first ??
one batch of consumables?
That's correct.
Delivered to your home.
And you sell it for?
$499.
How can you sell it so cheap?
That's no margin.
Right. Right.
So, we have
two revenue streams.
One is the machine
and one is the MKR Kit.
I get the replacement
of consumables and all that.
What we want to do
is we make sure
we get as many machines
out in the public as possible.
Okay. That's fine. So we'll
go into the consumables.
Exactly.
Yep. Yep. Exactly.
So the consumable side
of things,
it costs us $9 to $10
per ingredient kit.
At scale, we can get that down
to $7 per kit.
Is it a subscription,
just reorder?
We're encouraging our users to
go into a subscription system.
Okay. What's my monthly cost
for subscription?
$15 per 12?pack.
What is your retention rate
of the subscriptions?
So, we're not there yet.
You mean you're not selling
any of these yet?
So, we are shipping them
literally ??
MBA dudes!
I'm going to punish you!
We did our Kickstarter
in 2018,
and we're delivering
those 1,200 units
in the next two weeks.
How many have you shipped
so far?
We've shipped
about 24 of them.
So I should pay a million bucks
per unit you ship?
I'd just like to point out ??
Had you shipped 50,
then you'd be worth $50 million.
[ Laughter ]
How much money have you raised?
We've raised about $3 million
so far.
There you go.
At what valuation?
You've got to be kidding.
Depending on the room, between
$5 million and $10 million.
It just makes no sense to me.
You ?? It's like coming in
and asking us to believe
in the fairy godmother.
You have virtually no sales.
You have $3 million
put into it already,
and you have no proof
of concept, even.
I?I must be missing
something basic, but I'm out.
We did have some proof
of concept when we kickstarted.
We sold 1,000 of these things
in one month.
And like I said,
this is a space ??
But you haven't delivered them,
nor have you gotten
the feedback.
Greiner: Honestly,
you know, to Barbara's point,
the problem for me here is
everything tasted really good.
But because you haven't had
that in consumers' hands
and I don't know
what's gonna happen,
I can't invest at this point.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Look, what you're setting out
to do is right on.
Sure.
The challenge
is your margins.
Because you're going to have to
really retain people.
And I think that's gonna be
a lot more expensive.
And even if the valuation is
in the realm of where you're at,
it's gonna be hard
to generate enough profits
to give me a return.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Well, to address those
particular points, I'd love ??
He's out.
Address it with other Sharks.
Rodriguez: Aaron, brother,
let me tell you this.
First of all,
one piece of advice
is when you come in the Tank,
you have to make it attractive
for us to make some money.
Yeah.
When you come in here
and you say $500,000 for 2%,
five of us got turned off.
So for me, valuation ??
very competitive,
and we don't know
what we don't know.
For those reasons, I'm out.
