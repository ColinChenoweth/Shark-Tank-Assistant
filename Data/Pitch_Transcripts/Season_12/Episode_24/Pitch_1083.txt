Do you have that ability
to be resourceful?
[ Sniffing ]
To be a hungry hunter?
What I need to know is,
are you gonna hustle?
I've drained
my finances.
Eeh, Chihuahua, caramba!
Listen, listen, listen.
You haven't sold any yet!
We don't care.
Sharks: Ohh!
?I'll make you an offer.
?Are you nuts?
Guys, you have no reason
to be desperate.
No, no, no.
Hang on a sec, Mark.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Susana.
I'm Kevin.
while shopping online,
you're faced with an
overwhelming number of options
that can be hard
to compare with one another,
what you like,
what you didn't like about it,
then answer a few questions
about your personal preferences.
Then all of your data
runs through our algorithm,
helping us create
the perfect pillow for you.
Our modular design
allows us to create
over 35 possible
variations
through our innovative
process.
The best part?
While there are
a ton of pillows out there,
nobody else does this.
Even better,
our customers love us.
So, Sharks,
before you hit snooze,
which one of you
will join us
in helping everyone
get a good night's sleep?
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
Alright, Sharks,
right in front of you
in those really cool boxes
are your very own
custom Pluto pillows.
Now, we had to do
some research
to figure out
what we should craft for you.
We think these make great
starting?out points.
So, Mark, word around
the league
is that you prefer
fill pillows over foam pillows,
?Nice.
?I like my pillow squishy.
Daniel, we heard
how important it is
for your sleep products
to be hypoallergenic.
The good news is,
all of our pillows are.
Yours is a quilted cover
while Kevin's is a smooth.
So, Sharks,
enjoy your out?of?this?world
Pluto pillow.
Susana, I have a question.
I always assumed
that there was actually
a better pillow for everyone.
Are you saying that
that's not the case,
that really, truly, there is no
scientific best for everybody?
There isn't.
So, we take your body stats,
so we know that,
like, let's say,
if you're a side?sleeper,
you need that, like,
neck support
for the neck to
shoulder tip ratio,
whereas, like,
a stomach sleeper,
it's better if you sleep
on a flat pillow.
But besides that, we also
have empirical evidence,
we have over 1.5 million
data points
that we take into account,
of, like, what makes
a great pillow for you.
What do you mean by those
1.5 million data points?
So, we have an algorithm
on our site
that, every time anyone
goes on our website,
orders a pillow,
we store this information,
the computer actually
decides, like,
"Hey, this person needs this
foam with that plush cover."
So someone's
in the facility picking,
It sounds like your gross margin
structure is not so good.
Is there a reason why?
Because no matter
how much you grow,
if your gross margin
out the gate is bad,
you're just compounding
the problems.
Why are your gross margins
not healthier?
Like, if we could have
a bigger?size warehouse
to order more materials,
we could get that down
to $20 to $25
instead of $25 to $30.
You're talking about
a few dollars.
Like, $18 of
your cost is shipping.
Right.
Tell me a little bit
about the back?end operations.
How big is the team?
So, before this year,
it was actually just us two.
We boxed every pillow.
We answered all the questions.
We made everything.
You guys did all the boxing
in the warehouse?
Yeah. All of it.
All the boxing
in the warehouse.
We have over
1.5 million data points.
You have a utility patent
pending on what?
Yes.
On the way we make the pillows
combined with the algorithm.
[ Chuckles ] Really?
in terms of, like, evidence on
what makes a good pillow.
We did all the hard work
already, right?
'cause it's linear, right?
Yeah.
1.5 million data points
is nothing.
But you actually have
kind of dropped the ball,
but you guys are too small
for 8 million bucks.
I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
Herjavec: I have to tell you,
when you came out here
it's about my confidence in
your ability to overcome them.
So I like it all.
Hate the valuation.
Hate the valuation.
Don't let that
get in your way, Robert.
So I was being quiet
with my own algorithm
I think that's just
a little bit high.
Would you be able to go down
to 9% for $400,000?
No, I'm not gonna
come down that much.
I mean, would I go down
to 19, 19.5,
some marginal amount?
Sure, maybe,
if you could convince me.
But I think it's a lot of money.
It really is.
Okay.
I think 19 is just
a little bit too much.
We've seen
triple?digit growth
year over year
since we started,
but I think 19%, 20% is just
a little bit too much.
I think we can't really
go more than 10%
for $400,000.
I?I can't get there.
Okay.
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you.
Lubetzky: Guys, good luck.
Thank you so much.
so we launched online sales
of our ice cream
A Walmart buyer was
interested in the product line.
I was able to close the deal
with more than 4,300
Walmart locations nationwide.
When I pitched on "Shark Tank,"
I brought with me
our "nice cream."
We've since changed
the name to "Frobert."
There's nothing on the shelf
like it.
Now we're in more than
8,000 stores,
including Giant Foods,
Stop N Shop,
I'm nearing $1 million in sales
with $15 million
in committed purchase orders.
that's delicious,
just not as pretty,
for 10% of our company,
Fling Golf.
Sharks, golf courses
have a big problem.
Over 1,800 of them have
closed in the last decade,
It's called
Fling Golf.
It's the cool, athletic
alternative to regular golf.
[ Chuckles ]
You play Fling Golf with
a regular golf ball,
you're using
a single fling stick
to throw
the golf ball...
Oh, my God.
So just like snowboarders
are welcome on ski resorts,
Fling Golf can be played right
alongside traditional golf.
The best part is,
courses don't need
to make any changes at all.
They just let
the people play.
Fling Golf
has already been played
on over
1,000 golf courses.
Wow.
So, we've developed
an entirely new product,
a new sport embraced by
a younger generation
Who wants to go on
the fling of their lifetime
It's been played at
the country club in Brookline.
But ultimately,
it's gonna be like
there's no reason not to.
But the golf gods would strike
you dead with that thing.
A set of clubs.
Like, that's a good indication.
About 300.
So, what's the model?
How does it work?
How are you gonna get
the golf course to, like,
educate anybody playing
about the stick?
are, like, resorts.
They're able to advertise
to people
that aren't just the people
coming in to play golf.
When people arrive, they'll say,
"Hey, bring your family.
Even if you're a golfer,
bring your kids.
We'll give them
a Fling stick,
Like, it's just
gonna go nowhere.
Golf is on fire.
Because of
the distance.
?It's one of the only things.
?It's one of the few things
you can actually do outside.
They're gonna do
$3.5 million this year.
Right.
So you're definitely on?trend.
What I'm struggling with is,
how do you capture
a customer base?
The focus has been
on golf courses,
but we're selling
as much to consumers.
Actually,
in terms of numbers,
we're selling <i>more</i> to consumers
than we are on the golf course.
How much?
What did you sell last year?
Last year,
we sold $142,000.
Good for you.
$140,000.
What about this year?
We're $142,000
through July.
So what's one club
cost you to make,
Like, you're asking
for more than
10 times revenue valuation.
Can you walk us through
how you came up
with that delusional valuation?
[ Sharks laugh ]
Herjavec:
Wow, you're really sitting
next to Kevin a lot, Daniel.
We were on set for about
$400,000 this year,
It seems like it's not.
We've raised about ??
about $2 million.
There you go. That's why
the valuation's so high.
Greiner: Wow.
Herjavec: Where did you
raise that from?
You've raised $2 million?
Look, I like
the idea, guys,
but it's very difficult
to scale a new sport,
as you know, right?
Yes.
these balls, like
[Chuckling] flying all around.
Just 'cause you say
it's worth $3 million,
that doesn't mean anything.
It can't be worth
3 million bucks,
'cause you don't have
any cash flow
to sustain that valuation.
If you look at
what snowboarding did ??
Yeah.
Just like Bad Birdie.
Congratulations.
I can't believe it.
Greiner: Congrats.
?Alright.
?[ Chuckles ]
That was awesome.
That was awesome.
is a better way to grill
in an unlikely place.
Float'N'Grill is
lightweight, easy to use,
you won't have to worry about it
flipping over in the water.
Were you guys on, like,
Instagram just recently?
Oh!
We were on ??
We had a post back in 2018
that went viral,
In 72 hours,
we hit 4.7 million people.
Wow.
So you're just, like,
floating in the water,
and it's floating
next to you?
No, no, no.
That is not ?? Listen.
Ohh.
With zero marketing ??
That's not even
100 units!
Listen, listen,
listen, listen.
It's $199, which he
neglected to mention.
Yeah, but then out of
those 4 million views,
I would have expected
a little bit higher conversion.
I can explain that.
Listen, listen, listen.
There's more to the story.
We went viral
back in 2018.
We didn't have anything
to sell at that time,
because we didn't
have it in place.
Yeah.
I hate it when
that happens.
Oh, me too.
We didn't have an established
manufacturer for the grill.
Guys, guys, can I ??
I just want to step on
one thing for a second,
because it's important.
You want 20%.
[ Chuckling ] That imputes ??
...a million?dollar valuation.
Yes.
Yes.
Listen. The word out on the
street within the community is
nobody gives a poo?poo
about this thing.
That's wrong.
You're completely wrong.
They're not buying it!
They're not buying it!
You're completely wrong
about that,
because everybody
that sees it ??
Well, how come
there's no sales?
99% of those reactions on
that viral post were positive.
Is there something that you
could either license to them,
or is there a reason why they
couldn't do that themselves?
Why does your patent cover it?
We, in the ??
So, the first claim
on our patent
is a floating apparatus
that supports a cooking element
for cooking purposes.
Cuban: Good for you.
That's very broad.
It's very broad.
Yes.
I don't know if you're familiar
with Webers ??
probably the foremost
grill company in the U. S.
?Yep.
?Yes.
I'll set up
the meeting for you,
either sell them the patent
or license it.
I'll give you $200,000 for 50%.
$200,000 for 15%?
?Bam!
?5?0.
?5?0.
?Oh.
Lubetzky: 5?0. You can counter.
O'Leary: 50. Half.
Yeah, I mean ??
Half the community.
Yeah.
Herjavec: Wow.
You just said that they
sold $19,000 in sales.
Yeah.
So, we respect that offer,
but honestly,
we can't go that high.
What's your counter?
My counteroffer,
right off the bat,
is we believe
in this product so much,
I'm not opposed to
a partial loan.
I would do a $100,000 loan
at 7% interest rate,
$100,000 investment
for 15% to 20%.
Well, let's say 20%
to be fair.
I'm jumping in because
I like your patent ??
it is a strong patent ??
I mean, it sounds like
we're very far apart.
I mean, we are.
Can we negotiate on anything
with the licensing deal,
where you make
"X" amount of dollars
on the licensing deal
on top of having
the 22.5% in the company?
So your maximum that you're
willing to sell me is what?
22.5% is
what we can sell.
That's ?? yeah.
Here's my offer ??
the $100,000 investment
for 22.5%,
$100,000 loan at 7%.
We're gonna remove
the $2 per unit.
You don't need to do that.
Okay.
A billionaire.
A billionaire.
That's ?? That's insane.
That is insane.
How much is that?
That's a lot of money.
A billion. Oh, man.
I don't ?? Whoo!
Yeah.
by turning your tie shoes
into slip?ons.
Our unique material
has a slight texture
to keep your shoelaces tied,
while providing
a firm but comfortable grip
on your feet.
So, Sharks, don't shoelace ??
Stretchlace.
[ Chuckles ]
Leave a little bit of room
at the top,
on the country's largest
online retailer?
You would.
We are only
going after online.
Break down
the numbers for me.
Last year was $221,000.
This year, we're doing
$165,000.
However, there's
a little story to tell.
So, I left my job
in July,
No, so, I help
keep the lights on.
I have a full?time job.
I'm in technology.
I've been 22 years
in technology.
You're a couple?
I found product
with locks or clips,
That was three years,
a little over three years ago.
that was about
$35 million in revenue
So now what I'd like to see is,
how have you applied that?
Because the numbers,
for a person that has
20 years of experience
selling a $13 shoelace.
Ugh. I'm out.
Okay, guys, look, no disrespect
for you when I say this ??
you are shoelace cockroaches.
[ Laughs ]
I can't work with you.
I'm out.
but do you have that ability
to be resourceful
[Sniffs]
to be a hungry hunter,
I got to believe there's more
in you than shoelaces,
If you believe in
the vision that I see in you...
I want to stick to the 33%.
I?I just think
we're gonna do great things.
I really think you're going to
help all our entrepreneurs,
I believe in them.
$100,000 for 33%.
No desperation.
I'm just saying.
So you're saying that
you're not really interested
in the shoelaces, but ??
Herjavec: No, no, I believe
in the shoelaces.
Okay.
Don't get me wrong.
Let's get that to $3 million.
But while we're getting there,
let's unlock the potential
of this incredible woman
and figure out
what the next product is.
Let's do both.
$100,000, 33%.
What do you think?
[ Sighs ]
I don't know.
30?
Should we ask?
Yeah.
Okay,
would you take 30?
I will take 30.
You have a deal.
Yes!
High five!
High five!
?Congratulations, guys.
?Virtual hug! Virtual hug!
?Virtual hug.
?Congrats.
?Air hugs.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What just happened?
It was, like,
everybody was falling out,
then all of a sudden...
Did we just, like,
time travel?
What did you see that would
change your mind?
You bought a
cockroach shoe business.
Kevin. Kevin.
You may not realize this,
but to get great people,
sometimes
you have to pay them.
You are going to make
hundreds of dollars.
[ Laughs ]
Hundreds of dollars.
