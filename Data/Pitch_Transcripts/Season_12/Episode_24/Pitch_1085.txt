My name's
Mike Bashawaty.
And I'm Jeremy Quillico.
We're from
Plymouth, Michigan,
and we're here
seeking $200,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in our company.
Sharks, let me
paint you a picture.
It's sweet summertime.
You're on the lake
with your best friends,
knocking back
a cold one
and enjoying
the good vibes.
Everything is just perfect,
until ??
Both: [ Gasp ]
Hunger strikes!
Now, there is nothing better
than a hot, juicy cheeseburger
to fulfill that craving
and keep the party going.
And wouldn't it be crazy if you
could grill up some food
without ever having
to leave the water?
Well, Sharks, these guys
were just crazy enough
to come up with
a solution.
Introducing
the world's first...
The world's only...
Float'N'Grill!
[ Sharks cheer, laugh ]
Now, you're probably thinking
a grill that floats
on water?
We're thinking...
"Hell, yeah!"
Jeremy, did you say 19?
$19,000.
We just launched
a year and a half ago.
Ohhhh!
Don't give me
that "Ohhhh"!
Well, Mikey is a Shark!
I'm just coming in!
Let's go!
?You're a Shark, baby!
He's a numbers guy!
He is there! Let's do it!
You guys, at $2 a unit,
he will die of old age
before he gets his loan back.
[ Laughs ]
Any other offers,
guys?
Not a chance in Hell.
I'm out, just ??
I'm out.
Quillico:
Yeah, fair enough.
I truly, unfortunately,
with your valuation
and what your sales were ??
I'm sorry, I'm out.
I love you guys.
I mean, I love the entire story.
Except the $19,000 in sales.
We understand ??
It all falls apart on that.
We understand that, but those
are the numbers, unfortunately,
and that's why we're here.
Guys, you have an offer
here that might go away.
Guys, don't let
this opportunity float away.
The $19,000 is
a warning for all of us.
Yep. It is.
It is.
That deal just got better,
didn't it, Mikey? [ Laughs ]
Dude. Ahhh!
Cuban: Congratulations, guys.
Good luck.
Thank you.
?Thank you, guys.
?Good luck, guys.
?Take care, you guys.
?Float out of here.
Whew.
Dude.
I cannot ??
[ Both laugh ]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my goodness.
That was nuts.
We got a deal
with Daniel Lubetzky.
