Narrator: In Season 11,
farm owner Katey Jo Evans
made a deal with Lori Greiner
for The Frozen Farmer,
ice creams and sorbets
made with imperfect produce.
Greiner: I will give you
the money
if we can land
a major national chain.
Narrator:
Let's see what she's doing now.
Evans:
Airing in March of 2020
during the height
of the pandemic
put us in a really tough spot.
We had built an incredible
amount of inventory up,
anticipating increased sales,
but we couldn't get the product
from our warehouse
to the grocery store,
On the "Shark Tank,"
I gave you a challenge,
and you not only got into
one major retailer nationwide,
you got into four.
I love Frozen Farmer's mission.
I love that they use
unloved fruit
Evans:
There's been so many times
that we could have given up
and, quite honestly,
so many times
that maybe we even wanted to.
But we knew in our hearts
that The Frozen Farmer
was a continuation
of our family's legacy,
and the mission
of reducing food waste
is so important to us.
We're creating a better world
one pint at a time,
and that's something, for us,
that makes The Frozen Farmer
so much sweeter.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Alex van Alen.
And I'm John Pruellage.
We're from
Ipswich, Massachusetts,
and we're here
seeking $300,000
We don't care.
Pruellage: Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Wait.
I have a question.
Yeah!
Best answer ever!
We don't care.
We're not golf.
Let's say you get good.
You can go far and straight.
But then when you get to
the green, what happens?
It turns into
a golf club.
You can do
a flop shot.
Yeah?
You can do
a bump and run.
Hang on. This is your only club?
This is your putter...
Greiner: It's your one club.
That's it.
It's the whole thing.
Herjavec: ...this is
your chipping wedge.
Do everything with it.
This is the one thing
that might get me
to a golf course.
But, I mean, you could hurt
somebody if you hit them.
Yeah.
Herjavec: Yes.
This is way more accurate
than golf.
How many courses
have you sold this to?
Van Alen:
The specific golf courses
that are doing well with it
Alex and John,
this is my thoughts.
KIND bars are sold
in almost every single course
in America.
There's several golfers
that wear KIND colors
because they love it so much.
I can introduce you
to a lot of golfers.
I can introduce you
to golf courses.
This is going to be
a huge amount of work,
so I will do the deal
at 33% for the $300,000.
You are so greedy.
Alright, guys, look ??
I love golf.
I belong to a bunch of clubs.
Here's what I can do for you ??
I can point you.
Pruellage: Daniel's got
nothing to worry about.
We are committed,
and we are all in on this.
We're gonna see this
to the end,
and we know it's gonna be
a huge sport.
Very often, you have to
step down to get the poop,
but not anymore.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator: Next into the Tank
in terms of the search, the
keyword volume, the relevancy.
When somebody looks for
"stretch lace,"
knowing the Amazon algorithm,
knowing that they're searching
for laces, stretch, elastic,
and those titles
were in our keywords.
?Smart.
?Right.
She, in my eyes,
has a PhD in Amazon.
