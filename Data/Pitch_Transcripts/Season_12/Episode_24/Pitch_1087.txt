Hi. I'm Jamie Montz.
And I'm David Montz from
beautiful Boise, Idaho,
and we're the duo behind
The Original Stretchlace.
We're here today
seeking $100,000
for 15% equity
in our company.
We have created
a must?have product
to enhance the fit, function,
and fashion of tie shoes.
Traditional laces
are restrictive.
You have to tie them
every day,
sometimes
multiple times a day,
and on top of that,
they're bo?ring.
Give your shoes
an affordable lace?over
with The Original
Stretchlace.
The Original Stretchlace
is a stretchy lace
that elevates
the function of your shoe
Let's see if David can slip
into his boots
and back into his sneakers
in less than 10 seconds.
[ Exhales sharply ]
David, are you ready?
Ready.
Sharks, will you help me
give him a countdown?
Together: 10...9...8...
7...6...5...
4...3...2...1.
2 1/2!
Aah!
Slowing down in your
old age, David.
Too fast.
Too fast.
That was easy, right?
It was easy.
It was pretty easy.
10 seconds isn't a lot of time.
David: We have some
samples for you.
Herjavec: So, how does it work,
Jamie?
I take it out,
and I put them in?
Herjavec: How long ago
was that, Jamie?
Jamie, I'm struggling.
You are a 20?year
Amazon goddess
Jamie, I somewhat disagree
that necessarily, the shoelace
is the wrong vehicle.
But I am actually concerned
about you as an entrepreneur.
Maybe you're a great manager,
Thank you.
Herjavec: Hey, Jamie.
seeing the untapped potential
in Jamie as an entrepreneur.
I'll make you an offer.
Are you nuts?
[ Both chuckle ]
I'll give you ??
You might be crying for
a different reason in a minute.
[ Laughs ]
to unlock the potential
within you.
I'll give you
the $100,000 for 33%.
Ohhh!
Now cry.
If that don't make you cry,
I don't know what will.
Hang on.
Let me ?? Let me explain.
I don't think
it's a Sharky offer.
You're gonna help me.
I'm gonna help you.
You don't need an investor
if that's all you're ever
gonna do is shoelaces.
But I got to tell you,
as you're talking,
I think you have dreams
bigger than this.
Okay.
Cuban: You're allowed
to counter.
And?
What do you want to
counter with?
Um...
[ Whispering ]
25? Okay.
20, 25.
[ Normal voice ]
Would you accept 25%?
I...
We're nickel?and?diming
each other.
