I'm "Dino" Don Lessem
from Philadelphia.
in exchange for 10%
of our company, Dino Don, Inc.
Wow.
When it comes to
dinosaurs,
Don is a big deal.
the Lessemsaurus.
He's written dozens of books
about dinosaurs,
Lessem:
Look closely.
You won't believe
how realistic they are.
?Oh, whoa.
?Oh, look at the eyes.
Wow. [ Laughs ]
I would think
there's somebody in that.
[ <i>Roaring</i> ]
Cuban: Very cool.
We just started making
these robots last year,
So, what got you into
dinosaurs, Dino Don?
Well, I wasn't
a dinosaur nerd as a kid.
that you're going to make?
Lessem: No.
One of the things
that distinguishes us is
I said, "Spielberg," or "Steven,
when you're done here,
Jones: What do you think
it would cost?
$40,000?
What do you think,
Mark?
$18,000.
They don't have money
anymore.
That's why we want to
do a gate share with them,
because they don't have
the money,
OK.
We've done
very well.
Last year, we did
$1.6 million.
I don't believe that.
for their robotic dinosaur
company, Dino Don.
I mean, look. You've got to
give me real numbers.
I don't believe that.
You're all over the map
on terms of how you turn this
into a defined business.
I don't have the confidence,
Don, that you can execute.
I'm out.
I like to add value
to the companies I invest in,
Lessem: So, 25%...
But, guys, look.
...is a big chunk.
If you didn't need help,
you wouldn't be here.
Absolutely.
What you've discussed
is, you know,
$1.8 million in sales
going to 3,
you're hoping,
but that's just based off
of what you already know.
Right.
You don't know what I know.
Yes.
So it really ?? it's up to you.
We really appreciate it.
Um...
What do you say?
Jones:
Thank you so much!
Done!
I want you to know
how much we believe in you.
[ Laughter ]
No, you had that ??
[ Laughs ]
John: Don. Don.
This is going to be
a total game?changer.
Before you go, you know
any good dinosaur jokes?
What do you call somebody
who puts their right arm
in a velociraptor's mouth?
What?
[ Chuckles ]
?A lefty?
?Lefty?
?A lefty.
[ Laughter ]
I knew they knew these.
[ <i>Roaring</i> ]
Greiner: Bye, guys.
Thanks, guys.
?Bye.
?Congrats.
I've been doing dinosaurs
for 30 years
because I see
what it does for children.
Now, in just 5 months,
we've done $7.5 million.
Lewis: I knew that we had to
find a way
to help our business owners
earn an income again.
We had just partnered
with 1?800?Flowers,
we donate to the International
Fund of Animal Welfare.
Some of our sales
will go to protect animals
We've now done $50 million
in sales.
I can't wait to see you
in person
when this whole thing
is over
But the packaging,
I don't think,
conveys what
this is about.
It says "pour?over set."
If I walked by this
in a store,
I would have thought
it was some type of glass.
That's why I think that
the digital is working for you
That is my belief.
I don't care.
That's not even a belief.
You want to lose $1.4 million,
give it to me.
I'm cool with that,
alright?
What about the flip side?
She's trying to create jobs.
John:
I don't care if it's unfair.
That's my belief.
Socialism?
That's Marxism.
I don't care.
You know what?
When I started with my goods,
I didn't have $1 million.
I didn't have $10,000.
No, no, no. I'm not ??
I'm not questioning your belief.
What I'm saying to you ??
I don't care about
what they say. I'm out.
I don't care
how you get me to 8%.
Five point ??
How about 5.5%?
To Mark's point, my gut tells me
you're onto something,
but there's so much
uncertainty right now,
so I'm pricing in
the element of risk.
That's why I want the 8%.
Done! All right!
Awesome.
High five!
Thank you. Yay!
[ Laughs ]
?Congratulations.
?Thank you, guys, very much.
I don't like the casual,
"It's OK
So tell me,
why don't we have more sleeves
to fit all the beverages?
Well, Sharks, now we do.
but they've never done anything
on this kind of scale.
How's that feel to be in
a family of entrepreneurs?
I mean, truly, I really don't
think you need an investor.
I think you've done
an incredible job,
but I don't think
it'd be a great fit for me.
But for those reasons,
I'm out.
Alright. Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
I got the name right
this time, y'all.
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
I really don't think
that you need a partner.
You're already there.
You're on all the platforms.
You're getting
your own manufacturing.
You really picked good ??
good designs.
Thank you.
I wish you good luck.
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Daymond,
what are you going to do?
Done.
Alright!
There we go.
Oh!
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Congrats.
Well, I'm glad
I saved you 5%.
I need to finish
telling you the numbers.
John: They're not done yet.
OK.
OK.
So, now, Walmart's going to
carry us through next spring.
I don't physically
have ??
Sharks: Ohhh!
We don't have it yet.
?No.
?But they ?? they ??
I don't physically
have ??
Sharks: Ohhh!
I don't have it yet.
?No.
?But they ?? they ??
because first of all ??
Equity of the company,
don't let it go away from you.
I'd insult you, because ??
How many ?? How many units
do you have in inventory?
Uh, 3,500 right now.
?3,500.
?Wow.
So, that's, right there,
the underlying problem, right?
You know, during four months
or five months
after COVID hit,
you were unable to market those
