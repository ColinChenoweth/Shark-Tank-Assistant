I'm "Dino" Don Lessem
from Philadelphia.
I'm Val Jones, and
I'm married to this guy.
And we're excited to
be here
to ask you
for 500,000 bucks
in exchange for 10%
of our company, Dino Don, Inc.
Wow.
When it comes to
dinosaurs,
Don is a big deal.
He's a dinosaur explorer
who's excavated and recreated
the biggest dinosaurs
that ever roamed the Earth.
He's one of a handful
of human beings alive today
who's actually had a dinosaur
named after him ??
the Lessemsaurus.
He's written dozens of books
about dinosaurs,
and he was science advisor
to Steven Spielberg
on "Jurassic Park."
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Cool.
And Val, well, she just
loves spreadsheets.
She's raised
millions of dollars
for nonprofits,
zoos, and museums,
and she's
our financial mastermind.
We distinguish ourselves
by creating the most accurate
and educational dinosaurs
ever made,
and they're always
full size.
That means
up to 110 feet long.
Greiner: Wow.
You're looking at
a little Dakotaraptor.
A relative, a velociraptor,
is even smaller,
and this is just
a juvenile T. rex.
When they grow up,
they're 40 feet long.
They have a mouth big enough
to eat all of you.
Wow.
[ <i>Dinosaur roars</i> ]
?Oh!
?Wow!
[ Laughter ]
[ <i>Roaring</i> ]
Whoa!
That's cool.
Lessem:
Look closely.
You won't believe
how realistic they are.
?Oh, whoa.
?Oh, look at the eyes.
Wow. [ Laughs ]
I would think
there's somebody in that.
[ <i>Roaring</i> ]
Cuban: Very cool.
We just started making
these robots last year,
and we're already the leading
supplier in the United States.
So, dinosaurs are a big staple
of museums and zoos ??
that's how they increase
their attendance.
But these institutions
are in trouble right now,
so we've come up with
a unique gate?sharing plan
that will increase our revenue,
at the same time
getting them back
on their feet.
But also, we really need
your expertise to expand.
So, what do you say,
Sharks?
Do you want to make
millions of kids happy,
or do you want to
have to apologize
for the rest of your life
to your children
and grandchildren?
[ Laughter ]
That's up to you.
So, what got you into
dinosaurs, Dino Don?
Well, I wasn't
a dinosaur nerd as a kid.
and they sent me out
on a dinosaur story,
and I just fell in love with
this wonderful treasure hunt ??
that you're searching
for lost animals
and you could be the first
person who ever saw this animal.
Well, Kevin,
you were there originally.
Are these realistic?
[ Chuckles ]
They look ?? You know,
they look just like I remember.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Is this the average
size of the robots
that you're going to make?
Lessem: No.
One of the things
that distinguishes us is
we make the most accurate
and realistic animals
full size ??
up to 110 feet long.
You can't see animals
this size anywhere else.
Wow.
So it's only in the movie?
So there's nowhere
to actually go and see them?
Even in the movie, I can tell
you from "Jurassic Park,"
the animals were cut in half
so they could get a close?up.
I would say all the time,
"This is wrong."
And they would say,
"Could you shut up?"
So what I did was
I said, "Spielberg," or "Steven,
when you're done here,
can I have all
the sets and props?
I'm going to make
an exhibit,
and we're going to
raise money for research."
We raised $3 million.
It was the most attended
exhibit
in the history
of natural science.
?Wow.
?Wow.
It's what got me started
in the exhibition business.
Our business is we tour groups
of these dinosaurs
to zoos and museums,
and they increase
the attendance of the zoos ??
just their presence ??
15% to 50%.
I'll give you an example.
Last year,
we did a big exhibit,
45 dinosaurs.
440,000 people went
just to see the dinosaurs,
paying $6 additional a person.
They made $2.2 million.
Wow.
How much does it cost
to make an average dinosaur?
Jones: What do you think
it would cost?
$40,000?
What do you think,
Mark?
$18,000.
I think it's about
50 grand.
15.
5.
?$5,000?
?5 grand to make that?
I win!
John: [ Laughs ]
O'Leary: Are you kidding?
That's what it costs to make.
Greiner: Wow.
I'll buy that
one right now.
So that's why I say
the percentage is...
I'll buy that one
right now.
That's crazy.
I'll give you 10
for that one.
I'll give you 11.
[ <i>Roaring</i> ]
The point is not to
sell them.
The point is to make them,
rent them.
Zoos, you can attend
pretty safely outdoors,
so this is a big attraction
for them to boost attendance.
So, guys, part of your premise
here is that the zoos
are bringing in $2 million
or plus in revenue.
You feel like you should be
getting a percentage of that
rather than
just charging a flat fee?
It's not quite that.
First of all,
the zoos used to pay us.
They don't have money
anymore.
That's why we want to
do a gate share with them,
because they don't have
the money,
and we're going to help them
get back to health.
And is that because of
the pandemic?
Just this year.
Yeah.
OK. So now, you guys,
your revenue has dropped off
and fallen off a cliff,
basically.
Actually, no.
OK.
We've done
very well.
Last year, we did
$1.6 million.
This year, even with
the pandemic,
we're at $1.8 million.
Wow. How many dinosaurs
do you have ready to go on tour?
We have 150 dinosaurs
and the largest collection
of fossil skeletons.
Wow.
Greiner: 150?
We paid $1 million
for this stuff.
If we rent it
like we do the others,
it's $10 million
over five years.
OK, tell us about the economics
of the tour.
Seven months,
nine venues,
about three weeks
a venue.
12 staff to set it up.
Short run.
$40,000 a market.
We got the staff costs
of about $60,000.
We have the set up
of the technicians ??
$20,000 ??
and the dinosaurs are ours.
So that's it.
One full year from now,
what will you do?
$3 million
in the first??
Next year.
Next year.
Yeah. Yeah.
Plus whatever
gate share.
What do you think you'll make
on the $3 million?
Greiner: Yeah.
Last two years,
we made $250,000 profit.
So I actually will have to last
as long as a dinosaur
to ever get my money back.
No, that's not true,
because the profit
is going to go up hugely.
Next year,
$3 million in sales,
$2 million in profit.
No way.
That doesn't make sense.
Nah. Never.
3 staff ?? We're not
paying those expenses.
O'Leary:
No business can do that.
I mean, look, you've got to
give me real numbers.
I don't believe that.
but Kevin is skeptical
about Don and Val's projections
for their robotic dinosaur
company, Dino Don.
I mean, look. You've got to
give me real numbers.
I don't believe that.
You're all over the map
on terms of how you turn this
into a defined business.
I don't have the confidence,
Don, that you can execute.
I'm out.
I like to add value
to the companies I invest in,
and I just don't think
you need my help,
so I'm out.
I think it's
a very cool idea,
but if you had come in
with a mocked?up board
so I can visually see,
here's the zoo,
this is how they exhibit it,
it would have been
very helpful.
All right. We'll come back
tomorrow with the board.
But you understand
what I'm saying?
Yes. Yeah.
Absolutely.
And it's really important.
I'm sorry.
I find a visual
is worth a thousand words.
But because I didn't
get all that today,
unfortunately, sadly,
I'm out.
This is sad.
Sorry, too.
Guys, look, I like the idea.
Lessem: So, 25%...
But, guys, look.
...is a big chunk.
If you didn't need help,
you wouldn't be here.
Absolutely.
What you've discussed
is, you know,
$1.8 million in sales
going to 3,
you're hoping,
but that's just based off
of what you already know.
Right.
You don't know what I know.
Yes.
So it really ?? it's up to you.
We really appreciate it.
Um...
What do you say?
Jones:
Thank you so much!
Done!
I want you to know
how much we believe in you.
[ Laughter ]
No, you had that ??
[ Laughs ]
John: Don. Don.
This is going to be
a total game?changer.
Before you go, you know
any good dinosaur jokes?
What do you call somebody
who puts their right arm
in a velociraptor's mouth?
What?
[ Chuckles ]
?A lefty?
?Lefty?
?A lefty.
[ Laughter ]
I knew they knew these.
[ <i>Roaring</i> ]
Greiner: Bye, guys.
Thanks, guys.
?Bye.
?Congrats.
I've been doing dinosaurs
for 30 years
because I see
what it does for children.
They love dinosaurs
and they always will,
and we're bringing them
more dinosaurs
than anybody ever has ??
and bigger, too.
Narrator: This season was like
no other for "Shark Tank."
Together with the Venetian
Resort in Las Vegas,
we created a protected
bubble environment
to keep our entrepreneurs,
Sharks, and crew
as safe as possible
from COVID?19.
Though the past year has been
one of the most challenging
for the entire world,
"Shark Tank" businesses
have persevered,
given back, and even thrived.
The future has a lot of great
potential for you guys.
Kislevitz: With people
trying to figure out
ways to work out at home,
we sold out immediately.
Now, in just 5 months,
we've done $7.5 million.
Lewis: I knew that we had to
find a way
to help our business owners
earn an income again.
We had just partnered
with 1?800?Flowers,
and our new virtual
experiences were born.
Evans: We supplied everyday
essential goods
out of our drive?thru window
and donated to local
hospital workers,
police stations,
and fire departments
to thank them
for their service.
O'Leary: We've accelerated
the digitization
of the American economy.
This is a whole new America,
and it's a really good one.
Sodemann: Boho isn't just
a business anymore ??
it's a way for people
to get outside,
spend time with their families,
spend time with their friends.
It feels good to be able
to provide that to people.
Kupper: There are so many people
dealing with anxiety, insomnia.
So it's been really rewarding
to help thousands of people
at least get
a better night's sleep.
Crowley: For every
Baby Toon sold,
we donate to the International
Fund of Animal Welfare.
Some of our sales
will go to protect animals
and their habitats.
Connors: The new customers
who found us after "Shark Tank"
helped create 200,000 hours
of employment
for our weavers in Thailand.
Durity:
As a Black?owned business,
it's very important for me
to succeed,
because I represent the idea ??
someone that looks like me
can succeed in America.
It gives the culture hope.
Skaya: We're doing important
work in feline cancer,
feline diabetes in the hopes of
helping create therapeutics
to make sure that our cats
are staying stay healthy.
King: One of the biggest lessons
the military teaches you
is to leave it better
than you found it.
And it's been
that guiding principle
that's helped us here
in our hometown.
Whoo!
With this partnership,
we're going to take your product
to the masses.
Altieri: In the year since
"Shark Tank,"
we have tripled sales
to over $15 million.
Martin: We've sold over
7.5 million bags of Pipcorn
and done over $18 million
in sales.
Lutz: Hungry Harvest has
delivered over 2 million boxes
to hundreds of thousands
of households
across the United States.
We've now done $50 million
in sales.
I can't wait to see you
in person
when this whole thing
is over
and be able to give you
a big ol' hug.
John: I have so much hope
for our next generation
of entrepreneurs.
They are out here
to change the planet,
reach for the stars,
and they are
inspiring me, as well.
Cuban: This pandemic, everybody
has had to change in every way.
As bad as it is,
wherever there's change,
there's opportunity.
We will come out of this,
and there will be entrepreneurs
that take this moment
and will change the world.
As painful as it may be,
there will be good
that comes out of this.
Nope. And you don't need to buy
any additional equipment.
This is great.
Why is it so sweet?
Well, we do sell it just black,
but we do find that most ??
just like most Americans
drink their coffee
with milk and sugar, that's how
most people want to buy it.
Robert, that's the culture.
Philippines, Vietnam...
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
...that's the profile.
That's the
flavor profile.
It's actually normally
much sweeter in Vietnam.
Yeah.
It's like it packs
a punch, for sure.
So, what's your story?
Ohh.
How did you come up
with this?
Yes, so my background is,
is that I went to M. I. T.
and Berkeley.
I ended up working
at the World Bank
in finance supply?chain
management,
and I wanted to do something
that really was more creative,
something where I could go
a million miles per hour.
During the last year
at the World Bank,
I did this on the side.
I was on the subway with
a duffel bag full of samples
selling door to door
to get into our first 30 stores
and, you know, was manufacturing
and living with my sister,
making it out of her garage.
When was this?
This was four years ago.
What I think is
really cool is this.
I've never seen
anything like it.
It's really clever,
this packaging.
Yes.
Did you create
this yourself?
We perfected it in terms of
exactly the brew that we want,
but it's actually a technology
that's very common in Japan...
It's fantastic.
...and so we're the first people
to be bringing it over.
And how much does this
sell for?
$15 for five servings,
and it costs us $3.10
to make it.
So it's premium coffee.
It's premium coffee.
So I took it
to the Fancy Food Show,
and I was chosen
as the Innovation of the Show,
Really?
and so we got into
a thousand stores that month.
What year was that?
2017.
So total sales to date
is $4 million.
$4 million?!
$4 million all ??
People, let her
go through.
Please, go ahead.
2017, $170,000.
OK. '18?
And then in 2018,
we make $500,000.
OK, then?
Then in '19,
we make $1.6 million.
Whoa!
And year to date?
Year to date
is $2 million.
Wow.
Tell me
the margins, now.
Now we have
a 70% margin.
Greiner: Wow.
So you're doing $2 million
year to date, right?
Yes. Yes.
So what percentage of that
is online?
That's 80% online.
Wow. There you go.
OK, so that's your real
business outlet.
80%.
You've evolved
from being retail,
But the packaging,
I don't think,
conveys what
this is about.
It says "pour?over set."
If I walked by this
in a store,
I would have thought
it was some type of glass.
That's why I think that
the digital is working for you
and the stores
not so much.
So, I love the idea,
I think you're smart as can be,
very cool,
but I'm out.
That is my belief.
I don't care.
That's not even a belief.
You want to lose $1.4 million,
give it to me.
I'm cool with that,
alright?
What about the flip side?
She's trying to create jobs.
She's trying to bust her ass,
make money, and create jobs.
What about the flip side?
She's burned through enough
to give to enough people
to create other jobs.
So that means no one
should ever start a business.
That's socialism,
Daymond.
Herjavec: Daymond. Daymond.
That is so unfair.
John:
I don't care if it's unfair.
That's my belief.
Socialism?
That's Marxism.
I don't care.
You know what?
When I started with my goods,
I didn't have $1 million.
I didn't have $10,000.
No, no, no. I'm not ??
I'm not questioning your belief.
What I'm saying to you ??
I don't care about
what they say. I'm out.
you don't know
what demand is organic,
what demand is temporary,
and so because
I just don't know
what the demand drivers
are,
for those reasons,
I'm out.
I don't care
how you get me to 8%.
Five point ??
How about 5.5%?
To Mark's point, my gut tells me
you're onto something,
but there's so much
uncertainty right now,
so I'm pricing in
the element of risk.
That's why I want the 8%.
Done! All right!
Awesome.
High five!
Thank you. Yay!
[ Laughs ]
?Congratulations.
?Thank you, guys, very much.
I don't like the casual,
"It's OK
burning a couple of million
to launch a brand."
O'Leary: She is not ??
That is so disrespectful
to the hustle she's put in.
That's 100% wrong.
Yeah, that's 100% wrong.
You know how many people
are hustling? Everybody hustles.
Oh, my God. She put
four years' hustle into this?
Sometimes you got to spend money
to make money.
I know it's a cliché.
Well, you know what?
But it buys you time.
You put your money
where your mouth was,
and I agree with that ??
I respect what you did.
So tell me,
why don't we have more sleeves
to fit all the beverages?
Well, Sharks, now we do.
Introducing LIT Handlers,
a revolutionary way
to consume your beverage
with style and efficiency.
These bad boys aren't just
your regular old run?of?the?mill
insulators.
Our patent pending handlers have
an easy?to?grip handle
that's built
right into the sleeve
but they've never done anything
on this kind of scale.
How's that feel to be in
a family of entrepreneurs?
Two parents and
one of six kids,
and you're the kick?ass
entrepreneur.
My sister hates it.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
So I'll make you an offer.
I'll do it for 20%.
I'll give you 200 grand.
OK. 200 for 20.
That's somewhat ??
Herjavec: Wow.
O'Leary: Yeah.
Wasn't expecting that,
Kevin.
Listen, I want to get
in the family.
[ Laughs ]
Wow.
We would welcome you in
with open arms.
I mean, truly, I really don't
think you need an investor.
I think you've done
an incredible job,
and I think
you'll figure it out.
So I appreciate
the opportunity, but I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
I'm sorry.
I'm the tall one.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
but I don't think
it'd be a great fit for me.
But for those reasons,
I'm out.
Alright. Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
I got the name right
this time, y'all.
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
I really don't think
that you need a partner.
You're already there.
You're on all the platforms.
You're getting
your own manufacturing.
You really picked good ??
good designs.
Thank you.
I wish you good luck.
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
Daymond,
what are you going to do?
If you do it right now
and don't look at Kevin.
Done.
Alright!
There we go.
Oh!
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Congrats.
Well, I'm glad
I saved you 5%.
And it grows with the child.
You don't need anything else.
That is a cool idea.
It's a really good
idea, yeah.
So, tell us about you.
How did you come up with this?
So back in 2012,
I was trying to
potty train my daughter.
She was struggling,
so I quit my job
to potty train her.
?You quit your job?
?You quit your job?
I quit my job.
To potty train
your child?
Yeah, because when the child
is afraid
of going down on the potty,
they won't go.
My daughter is deathly afraid.
It can be really stressful.
Yeah. So when they are
really afraid, they hold it.
Yes.
And then ?? So that's
what happened to my daughter.
So the magic moment was when
she, with her own words ??
she was almost 3 ??
she said, like,
"If you sit on the toilet,
I'll sit with you."
So this is what I did.
I sat down on
the toilet with her,
she sat in front of me,
so my stomach
became her back support
and she went number two
several times that day.
So that worked because
you were there with her?
Yes, I thought, at some point,
I cannot be on the toilet
the whole day with her.
[ Laughter ]
So, I'm a legal assistant.
I used all that background
that I have,
and I said,
"I have an invention."
So that day, I did
all the legal research
and I filed for a patent.
I have my utility patent.
I need to finish
telling you the numbers.
John: They're not done yet.
OK.
OK.
So, now, Walmart's going to
carry us through next spring.
Yes.
And they made a commitment
to put us in 4,800 stores
which is a $1.1 million P. O.
Yes.
And Menards
just made a commitment
to put us in 350 stores.
Yes.
So you have a $1.1 million
purchase order?
I ?? I have
in talks of it.
I don't physically
have ??
Sharks: Ohhh!
We don't have it yet.
?No.
?But they ?? they ??
I don't physically
have ??
Sharks: Ohhh!
I don't have it yet.
?No.
?But they ?? they ??
Yes.
And you don't.
And that's the challenge,
and so for those reasons,
I'm out, guys.
I'm sorry, Mark.
because first of all ??
Equity of the company,
don't let it go away from you.
I'd insult you, because ??
How many ?? How many units
do you have in inventory?
Uh, 3,500 right now.
?3,500.
?Wow.
So, that's, right there,
the underlying problem, right?
You know, during four months
or five months
after COVID hit,
you were unable to market those
and sell those units
direct to the customer.
I think that's what
we're all saying up here.
And then it's just
a high valuation.
I mean, listen,
if Lori was interested,
then maybe I'd come in
with her,
because she's the Queen of Poo,
you know.
And now you have made Daymond
also the King of Poo.
Cuban: Well done.
Congratulations.
All right, listen, you're
no fool when it comes to stool.
?Hey, congrats, guys.
?Thank you, guys.
Congratulations.
?You're welcome.
?Thank you.
Did not see that one coming.
Me either.
[ Crying ]
Oh, my God.
