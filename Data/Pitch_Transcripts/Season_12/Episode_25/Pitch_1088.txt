Mullin: We partner with the best
coffee farms in Vietnam.
It is out of this world.
We make the most accurate
dinosaurs, full size.
I'll buy that one right now.
Let's fill your bank
with a lot of cash.
You're a wolf
in sheep's clothing.
Make me an offer.
50%.
You came here too early,
and you asked too much.
You want to lose
$1.4 million? Give it to me.
That is so disrespectful.
This is wrong.
That's insane.
Could you shut up?
Did not see that one coming.
Hi, I'm Debbie,
and I'm here today
seeking $600,000
in exchange for 4%
of my company.
?Whoa!
?Ohhhhh!
Wowza!
Mullin: [ Laughs ]
My mom immigrated here
from Vietnam,
and even though I was born
and raised in California,
make no mistake,
I was definitely raised
in a Vietnamese household.
And I loved
everything about it ??
I loved the food,
I loved the culture,
and I especially loved
the sweet, creamy treat
of Vietnamese coffee.
If you're not familiar with it,
it's just a simple,
dark?roasted coffee
that's paired with sweetened
condensed milk,
and it is out of this world.
Sharks, nowadays, people are
looking more than ever
for that coffee shop experience,
and Copper Cow Coffee
is exactly that.
Our single, individual
pour?overs
allow for anyone
to make a gourmet coffee
without any additional
equipment.
Simply take your pour?over,
open it up, and grab
your biodegradable filter.
Gently hang it over your cup,
and then tear off the top,
and then pour hot water
over the organic grounds
and immediately watch
as your organic coffee
drips directly into the cup.
And we partner with
the best farms in Vietnam
to bring the absolute
best Vietnamese coffee
to the U. S.
Once brewed, then you get to add
your Copper Cow Creamer,
and there is nothing else
like it on the market ??
there are no preservatives
or additives.
And then stir,
and within seconds,
you will be sipping on your own
perfectly balanced
Vietnamese coffee.
So Sharks, tell me ?? who's
ready to be their own barista?
O'Leary: Tell us about
what's in front of us, Debbie.
Yeah, so, what you have
in front of you
is a sampling of
our best?selling products.
You, of course,
have the classic,
which is what I just made here,
that comes with
the milk and sugar.
But we also have it just black.
And then on your far right,
you've got our churro
and our lavender.
They're natural infusions,
and trust me,
they're all delicious.
I got to tell you, you know,
this packaging is
absolutely incredible.
Thank you.
And I just came back
from Ho Chi Minh,
and I stood on line
two hours
for one coffee shop.
Yup.
Now, I learned how to ??
Herjavec: Really?
Now, are you telling me
that I didn't have to
wait out there
for two hours?
which is good
for you now, right?
Mullin: Right.
And retail ??
we're still in retail.
That 20% is ??
that's from a growing number.
Last year, when your sales
were $1.6 million,
how much money
did you lose?
We lost $1.4 million.
?What!
?Whoa!
?$1.4 million?
Did you get an outside
investment in '18?
We raised $2 million.
How much cash
do you have in the bank?
We have $1.5 million.
Did you generate
enough margins ??
Did you raise more money?
Sorry, Mark.
Wait. We did.
We did raise more money.
Ah, there you go.
So, the existing investors
invested another 1.5.
At what valuation?
And what was
the valuation then?
$15 million.
Sharks: 15?!
Mullin: Yes.
What you're asking today.
Yes.
That's insane!
So personally, like,
I like very,
very weak coffee
and I love to get behind
what I do a deal with.
You know, Debbie,
this is a very expensive bet
that I'm not
going to take.
I'm out.
Debbie, you want me to ??
you want me to be ??
you want me
to tell you the truth?
Yes.
This?
Amazing, right?
Thank you.
Lost $700,000 then lost
another couple of million,
have 1.4 million
in the bank.
You burn through all
that money, and you go,
"Well, that's very common
in a startup."
What would the everyday person
say about that right now?
They'd say,
"Go make some money."
Yeah.
They'd say,
"Go make some money."
The everyday person
would say,
"I just lost my job
and my house."
Mm?hmm.
The everyday person
might say to you,
"You got $1.4 million
in the bank.
What are you doing
for others right now?"
Instead of asking
for more money, right?
That's a great question.
Yes, yeah.
Yeah, but Daymond,
that is so unfair.
But that ??
That's not unfair.
That's just so unfair.
Alright. Debbie ??
OK, well, Daymond, I would like
to just reiterate ??
You can talk to them,
because they're so caring.
He's out.
Debbie, so...
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
There are some companies
that need to make money
along the way ??
I'm with Daymond 100% ??
but you know,
I'm in tech.
Most companies in tech
have to start
with a lot of investment,
and it takes a while
to break even, so I get that.
I mean, I think ?? I think
you're the real deal.
Thank you.
So I'll make you
an offer.
I'll give you the $600,000
for 8%.
I know it's aggressive,
but it's what
I feel comfortable with.
Look, the challenge
of this horrific COVID period,
as an investor, is
as trends accelerate ??
in this case,
going to online ??
Thank you, Debbie.
Great job.
Mullin:
I took Robert's offer,
even though it cut my valuation
in half,
because I really think
that he's going to
bring so much to the business.
In these times,
even though we're on track
to being profitable,
we always want to kind of know
what's the next thing,
and I think that someone
like Robert
can really help us
think that through
and also really help us
with a lot of
the marketing opportunities
that a Shark can bring
to a brand like ours.
A lot of entrepreneurs think,
"I'm going to start a company,
and the first thing
I have to do is raise money."
That's wrong.
They failed to learn ??
That's what happened here.
Well, no,
a lot of people think
just by raising money,
they've accomplished something.
It's not an accomplishment.
It's an obligation.
But that doesn't
always work, Mark.
Greiner: Exactly. Exactly.
Well, I can't sleep
if I lose a dollar
of somebody else's money.
to help redistribute the weight.
That's not all, though.
We've also added a pocket
inside the reinforced handle,
so no more worrying about
leaving your go?tos behind.
Easily slide
your lip balm, your pen,
or even your car key
in our cute and stylish pocket.
So tell me, Sharks.
Are you ready to get
a handle on it?
Cuban: Absolutely.
[ Laughter ]
?Good job.
?Great job.
Thank you!
[ Giggles ]
So with the weight of the child
and the nonskid pads,
that's your break.
