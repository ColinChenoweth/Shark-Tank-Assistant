Mullin: We partner with the best
coffee farms in Vietnam.
It is out of this world.
We make the most accurate
dinosaurs, full size.
I'll buy that one right now.
Let's fill your bank
with a lot of cash.
You're a wolf
in sheep's clothing.
Make me an offer.
50%.
Hi, I'm Debbie,
Wowza!
Mullin: [ Laughs ]
My mom immigrated here
from Vietnam,
O'Leary: Tell us about
what's in front of us, Debbie.
Yeah, so, what you have
in front of you
is a sampling of
our best?selling products.
You, of course,
have the classic,
which is what I just made here,
which is good
for you now, right?
Mullin: Right.
Sharks: 15?!
Mullin: Yes.
What you're asking today.
Yes.
That's insane!
So personally, like,
I like very,
very weak coffee
You know, Debbie,
this is a very expensive bet
that I'm not
going to take.
I'm out.
Debbie, you want me to ??
you want me to be ??
you want me
to tell you the truth?
Yes.
This?
Amazing, right?
Thank you.
Lost $700,000 then lost
another couple of million,
have 1.4 million
in the bank.
Alright. Debbie ??
OK, well, Daymond, I would like
to just reiterate ??
You can talk to them,
because they're so caring.
He's out.
Debbie, so...
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
There are some companies
that need to make money
along the way ??
I'm with Daymond 100% ??
but you know,
I'm in tech.
Most companies in tech
have to start
with a lot of investment,
Thank you, Debbie.
Great job.
Mullin:
I took Robert's offer,
even though it cut my valuation
in half,
because I really think
that he's going to
bring so much to the business.
In these times,
even though we're on track
to being profitable,
we always want to kind of know
what's the next thing,
to help redistribute the weight.
That's not all, though.
