Hey, Sharks, my name
is Destiny Padgett,
So, Destiny,
before we get going,
tell us about yourself.
OK. I'm 31.
I'm from Buna.
Where is Buna?
[ Laughs ] It's in
the middle of nowhere.
I'm about 30 minutes
from Louisiana.
So when I was 17,
I moved to Utah.
I finished high school there,
I went to a little bit
of hair school,
I met a guy, I got pregnant,
So what are your sales,
Destiny?
Wow.
Year to date,
we are at 630.
?Whoa!
?Wow!
?Nice!
$630,000?
What?!
Destiny,
I gotta tell you ??
you are a wolf
in sheep's clothing.
[ Laughs ] Thank you.
You know,
you came out here
O'Leary: Listen, Destiny,
it's a simple business,
but it's working.
Destiny, you've done
an amazing job
of growing this business.
Destiny, congratulations.
I mean, lots of people
can get sales.
Not a lot of people can get
$200,000 in profits
Cuban: Congratulations,
Destiny.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Destiny.
Thanks, y'all.
?She's great.
?How fun was she?
I think she's terrific.
Padgett: I just made a deal
with Daymond.
This means everything.
This means we're going to grow
