Hey, Sharks, my name
is Destiny Padgett,
and I'm from the small town
of Buna, Texas.
I'm seeking $200,000
for 10% equity in my company.
Sharks, around the world,
we all share a common need ??
We all need a drink, am I right?
And no one likes holding a drink
that's ice?cold wet
and dripping in condensation.
Whether you're drinking
a protein shake
from an ice?shaker bottle,
an iced coffee
from a local cafe,
or just a brewski
while kicking it with the boys,
nobody wants
sweaty, clammy hands.
And, just like us,
our drinks come in
all different shapes and sizes.
So, Destiny,
before we get going,
tell us about yourself.
OK. I'm 31.
I'm from Buna.
Where is Buna?
[ Laughs ] It's in
the middle of nowhere.
I'm about 30 minutes
from Louisiana.
So when I was 17,
I moved to Utah.
I finished high school there,
I went to a little bit
of hair school,
I met a guy, I got pregnant,
and so then I moved to Texas.
I moved back in with my parents,
and from there,
I mean, I was pregnant,
so I had to do something
to take care of my kid.
And in 2014,
I started my first Etsy store.
And I've just been growing
and glowing since, y'all.
I have to say,
this is extremely comfortable.
Yes.
Sometimes the simplest
things are the best solutions.
But if I had to just hold it
myself like this,
it's a pain.
Yeah.
This is really good.
Why can't somebody
just knock you off?
Well, I do have
the pending patents.
Herjavec:
What's your patent on?
It on the pocket
with the handle.
Which is ingenious,
right?
Where is the pocket?
It just makes it
so much easier.
Oh, it's in
the handle. OK.
There's no pocket.
I could put my pen
in here...
There is.
Your spoon was in it.
Oh.
So I could be ready to sign
a contract at any moment.
That's right.
On the ready.
[ Laughs ]
OK, what's
your best seller?
It's really a tie between
this slim that's in your hand,
the pint?size ice cream,
and the 30?ounce size.
Herjavec:
Do you make these by hand?
No, sir. No.
They're manufactured
overseas in China.
So what are your sales,
Destiny?
Wow.
Year to date,
we are at 630.
?Whoa!
?Wow!
?Nice!
$630,000?
What?!
Yeah. [ Laughs ]
Thousand?
Yes, sir.
Daaaang!
?Wow.
?Whoa!
Wow, this story got really
interesting real fast.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I have to admit,
I thought it was
a total piece of [bleep]
but it's actually
pretty good.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
It's an easier way
to eat ice cream,
that's for sure. Right?
It is.
Does somebody else
make one
with a handle
and no pocket?
So, right after I did
my first run of these,
before I had the pocket,
someone in China, they started
trying to sell them.
Oh, you were getting
knocked off.
Yes.
On the 30?ounce size.
With the pocket
or without the pocket?
Without the pocket.
You own 100%
of the company?
100%.
Do you have
any loans?
Nope.
And what do you think you're
on track to do this year?
It's amazing.
Thank you.
I'm on track to do $780,000.
Wow.
So how much does
this cost you to make?
Let's just say
this size.
That size costs me $1.20,
landed.
For wholesale,
we sell them for $3.19
in minimums of three,
and retail on that is $8.99.
Our biggest size,
the 30?ounce size,
it costs me $1.60.
Wholesale is $4.44,
minimum of three.
Retail on that
is $12.99.
Destiny,
I gotta tell you ??
you are a wolf
in sheep's clothing.
[ Laughs ] Thank you.
You know,
you came out here
and you're bubbly
and you're fun,
and then, bam!
Cuban: Boom!
You know your numbers.
What percentage of your sales
are wholesale,
and what percentage
are retail?
It is split
right down the middle.
Is it from Etsy, mostly,
or do you also sell
from your own website?
I sell from my website,
I sell from Etsy,
and I sell on Amazon.
And what will you net
this year?
I'm hoping I net
around $200,000.
Yeah!
Wow! Nice.
So what do you need
the money for?
Um, I really want y'all.
I ?? With the money, though,
I would just keep growing.
I really want help
with licensing ??
I want to be able
to do sports ones,
I want to be in bookstores,
college bookstores.
I didn't go to college for this.
So, my dad was an entrepreneur.
My mom was a photographer.
All six of their kids
are entrepreneurs.
I have a little pool of people
that I can call
and ask things to,
O'Leary: Listen, Destiny,
it's a simple business,
but it's working.
Destiny, you've done
an amazing job
of growing this business.
Destiny, congratulations.
I mean, lots of people
can get sales.
Not a lot of people can get
$200,000 in profits
and just be
getting started.
Mm?hmm.
So, I mean, what you've
accomplished is incredible,
Cuban: Congratulations,
Destiny.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Destiny.
Thanks, y'all.
?She's great.
?How fun was she?
I think she's terrific.
Padgett: I just made a deal
with Daymond.
This means everything.
This means we're going to grow
and be a multimillion?dollar
company. [ Laughs ]
