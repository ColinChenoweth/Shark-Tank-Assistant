My name is Judy Abrahams.
I am from San Andrés Island,
Colombia,
and I am the Queen
of Potty Training.
And I am Chris Guerrera,
and I am the King of
Manufacturing.
We are seeking $300,000
for 10% of our company...
Dang.
...the Super Potty Trainer.
Herjavec: Wow.
Sharks, potty training
can be stressful,
scary, and
a messy experience
for both the parent
and the child.
So, let's say adiós
to those bulky tops,
bye to those soiled seats,
and say hello
to the Super Potty Trainer,
the perfect training device
to quickly and safely
potty train your child
to go like a pro.
Like a pro.
[ Laughter ]
So Sharks, let me
show you how it works.
Simply take
your Super Potty Trainer,
lift up your toilet seat,
place the Super Potty Trainer
in position,
lower your seat,
and that's it.
The Super Potty Trainer
has a steady back support
that allows the child
to sit directly on the toilet
on day one.
Also, the Super Potty Trainer
has some nonskid pads
that makes it adjustable.
Wow.
The Super Potty Trainer
is the real deal here ??
is the real tool to potty train
your child in no time.
So Sharks, let's fill your banks
with a lot of cash.
?Yowza.
?Whoo!
Cuban: Yowza.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
Let's get down
to business...
Together: With
the Super Potty Trainer!
?Ha!
?[ Chuckles ]
Uh, great idea.
Great idea.
Yay!
I have a question,
Judy, though.
Won't the baby's back
just push it back?
Because I have
2 1/2?year?old twins,
so I'd have it
right at the front.
Wouldn't they push it back
right away when they sat on it?
No, because you have
the nonskid pads.
Yeah?
So if the child is small,
you move it forward
and it doesn't move.
It doesn't move.
It does not move.
And Chris, what do you do?
What's your background?
Herjavec:
And who are you?
OK, so I'm a guy
that comes out of
corporate America.
I'm on patents
for Ford Motor Company
and ran BMW plants.
So, I come into play here
with the manufacturing side,
where we can do all of this
in the USA,
and we can do it for $2.30
for my cost.
Wow.
And with higher volume,
I can do it below $2.
Let's talk about sales.
OK, so we launched this
in March.
Wow.
Lots of good sales volume
with a big, big box.
Who?
Walmart.
OK, sales, sales.
So, in six months,
we're at $65,000 in sales.
How many stores are you in?
Just under 400.
Chris, that's not exciting.
What's your packaging
look like? Do we see it?
That's it.
Just this?
With the sticker?
No, it's in a display box.
Stay on the numbers.
Stay on the numbers.
$65,000.
Right.
Breaking news ??
you're not worth $3 million.
Well, hang on, Kevin.
There's more to the story.
Abrahams: Kevin, wait.
of Judy and Chris' business,
Super Potty Trainer.
So, you have a $1.1 million
purchase order?
I ?? I have
in talks of it.
Abrahams: Listen.
O'Leary: Breaking news,
breaking news,
back to not where you were
with $3 million.
I think I'm just trying
to understand, because ??
because if you have
a purchase order,
you have a purchase order.
I think ??
So, when Walmart said to you,
"I'm giving you a commitment,"
what does that mean?
So Walmart said,
with the pandemic, right,
everybody's sales were flat
completely for two months.
There was nobody
in the stores.
Not digital direct.
You know,
I got to tell you,
kids are still pooing
during the pandemic.
Yep.
So Walmart says,
"Let's carry you
through the holiday,
and if the sales continue
to grow the way they're growing,
we're going to put you
in all the stores for 2021."
Are you still talking about it,
or is it real?
No, it's real.
Greiner: Wait.
But the P. O. isn't.
You know how many guys
have come in here, Chris...
Understand.
...telling us they got their
million?dollar Walmart P. O.?
Then we start probing...
Yeah.
...and it's we're talking,
we're liking, they're liking.
John: Chris, what was your
sell?through
through the doors of Walmart?
What was the sell?through?
Greiner: Right.
Guerrera:
So, 356 stores.
It's about 600 a month.
600 units a month?
Correct.
Is this two units
in a month?
I think you're right.
It's about two.
That's a low number.
I mean, is it the advertising?
Is it confusing?
Because I'm looking at
this toddler ??
I never seen a toddler taking
a dump reading a good book.
I've never seen that.
[ Laughter ]
Maybe people are thinking
you're just trying to
sell a book or something.
Look, it's cute.
I get it.
I think ??
It's adorable.
I've just never seen it.
I'm confused.
I can tell you
the customer feedback
has been pretty strong.
Yes.
Cuban: So, OK,
the product looks great.
I remember with my son,
trying to get him potty trained,
it was hard.
It was a pain in the butt.
Yes.
But you priced it
as if you already have
three years of great results.
Herjavec: Chris, you got to
walk me through that.
Like, I love the product,
but you're pricing this thing
on potential commitments
from Walmart.
You're telling me
this is worth $3 million
and you've got $60,000 in sales.
Your valuation is so nuts,
we're never going to get there.
I'm out.
You came here too early,
and you asked too much.
I'm sorry, my friends.
King and Queen of
Super Potty Trainer, I'm out.
When it comes to number two,
she's number one.
Abrahams: Lori, that's why.
You know what I mean? But ??
Do you really mean that?
Herjavec: Ha?ha.
He's been saying that
for 10 years.
Abrahams: Listen.
Lori, we have to ??
Daymond, if you want to
go in with me...
Please.
...we can go 50/50.
And my feeling is
that we would have to give you
the $300,000.
Hold on, Lori.
Yep.
Are you writing me
a note?
No, go ahead. Say it.
50%.
O'Leary:
So, 300,000 for 50%.
Exactly where I was at. See?
Oh, that's so funny.
Listen, that's better
than nothing.
You got an offer ?? 50%.
That's a great offer.
I'm shocked.
So we'll give you the $300,000
for 50%,
and then we will figure out
who we license it to
and see if we can get somebody
to take this under their wing
and spread you out nationwide
in all retailers.
For me, that is
what this needs right now,
and it will sell,
and you will not regret it.
Lori, from Queen to Queen...
[ Laughs ]
...you got a sweet deal,
so we'll take your offer.
Oh, good! Yay.
[ Cheering ]
Thank you, Daymond, and
thank you, guys. Thank you.
Abrahams: Lori and Daymond
have no idea
what they just did
to my life.
I have struggled financially
for a long time,
and I have worked so hard
for the Super Potty Trainer
because I know
it's an amazing product.
Can I get a hug?
Abrahams: "Shark Tank"
changed my life.
I'm living the American dream.
I can't believe it.
This is amazing.
We got two Sharks, not one.
We got two Sharks!
I know. [ Laughs ]
Thank you.
