Hey, Sharks, my name is
Matt Mundt.
And I'm Angie Kupper.
And we are...
Both: Hug Sleep!
[ Chuckles ]
Aww.
We're a husband?and?wife team
from Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
and today we are
seeking $150,000
in exchange for
10% of our company.
Sharks, like so
many people out there,
we've got a real problem
in the bedroom.
Hmm?
Between his sleepwalking
and my restless legs,
there's a whole lot of action
and not enough sleep.
So that's why
we invented...
Both: Sleep Pod!
A first?of?its?kind
sleep solution
designed to simulate the feeling
of being hugged or cuddled.
Sleep Pod uses a specialized
4?way stretch material
that wraps around
your entire body.
Oh, wow.
As its fabric stretches,
it wants to compress,
providing a gentle,
calming pressure,
helping you to relax
and fall asleep.
Now, I know what you're
thinking, and you're right ??
it's essentially
an adult swaddle.
[ Chuckles ]
But Sleep Pod is so much
more than that.
It's made from a breathable
material that doesn't trap heat.
It's lightweight,
so it's easy to travel with.
And best of all,
it's machine?washable.
And my favorite part
is your significant other...
[ Chuckles ]
...can't steal
your covers.
But in all
seriousness, Sharks,
we spend 1/3
of our life sleeping,
yet so many of us struggle to
get a good night's rest.
With Hug Sleep, we can bring
some magic back into the bedroom
[ Chuckles ]
and get people sleeping
like babies again.
So, Sharks, who want
to jump in bed with us?
So, I know 2020 has been a
little bit of a stressful year,
to say the least, and it looks
like all of you guys
could really use
a good hug right now.
We'd ask Robert and we'd love
to have you come up here
and test out
Sleep Hug.
To hug you?
No, no, no!
To try Sleep Hug!
Oh!
There you go!
Unless you really
want a hug.
Alright, go ahead and have
a seat on the side of the bed.
You're gonna put it on just
like you would a pair of pants.
So put both legs.
Both?
Both legs. Yep.
And you're gonna
stay seated for this...
Okay.
...but go ahead
and scooch back
and swing your legs
over onto the bed.
Go ahead
and get comfortable.
You wanna pull
it up to your chest.
You may wanna
go back on the ?? Yeah.
Oh. Pull it.
Yeah, you can
scooch your butt back.
Cuban: Just stand up. Pull it.
Now, Robert,
start hopping.
So it fits
pretty snug?
It is.
Yes.
We don't advise
to do that.
Yes, 'cause we don't
want you to fall.
Oh, it feels great!
And now,
put your arms
your arms in it, right?
Put my arms in?
So you actually want to lay down
before you do that,
'cause I would hate
to see you fall.
I'm an advanced
sleeper.
[ Laughs ]
There you go.
So now, yeah,
you can lay down.
Greiner: Wow.
[ Laughter ]
It's actually <i>really</i>
soothing.
Why is there
a pocket?
Kupper: Yeah. So we're going
to tell you about that.
That's the
newest addition.
A lot of people
like to sleep
with one foot out
for temperature regulation.
Mm?hmm.
Ohhh.
So that is a pocket
so you can, if you want.
But if you choose
not to ??
Oh, see?
[ Laughter ]
You okay, Robert?
[ Whimpering ] I'm okay.
That definitely doesn't
normally happen.
Ohh!
[ Laughter ]
See what we have
to deal with?
Oh, my God!
I'm bleeding!
[ Sighs ] Hey.
Greiner: [ Laughing ]
Oh, my God!
Cuban: Robert
is bleeding.
Robert, are you okay?
I hate you!
[ Chuckles ]
Kupper: Oh, no!
[ Laughing ] Oh.
You're doing everything
we advise against, so...
Okay, let's talk
about acceptance in the market.
Robert, are we gonna
talk about that?
Robert is sitting
here bleeding.
[ Chuckling ]
Are we gonna talk about that?
I'm bleeding, people!
Get a lawyer.
[ Chuckles ]
Before I bled to death...
Yeah.
...it was very comfortable.
Good. Good.
Good. Good.
Okay, so, guys ?? sales.
So it's been about 16 months
or so since we started selling.
Lifetime sales to
date are about 490,000.
So in the last 12 months or so,
we've done 335,000
in top line sales.
On that, we grossed
about 215,
and our net on
that is about 140.
Greiner:
Where were you selling?
Yeah, so we sell
direct to consumer
through our website,
as well as Amazon.
And what do you sell them
for online,
and what does it cost you
to make landed?
It typically
sells for $99.99.
And each Sleep Pod costs us on
average about $22.50 to make.
But as we continue
to scale,
we can get that down
to about 18 bucks.
So I just put it on. It's warm,
it's very silky?soft feeling.
Mm?hmm.
Very snuggly.
Very stretchy.
Absolutely.
So I think it'll be really
helpful if we took a step back
and kind of explain
how this came to be.
So a few years ago,
I heard about weighted blankets,
like the rest of
the world.
I ended up buying
one of these weighted blankets,
and I tried it on,
and I loved it.
That initial pressure really
brought on this sense of calm.
But I went to sleep later
that night, and very quickly,
I ran into the all?too?common
list of complaints
associated with
weighted blankets.
1, they trap heat like crazy
and they just overheat.
Next, they're very
difficult to wash.
You can't just take
a 30?pound weighted blanket
and throw it
in your washing machine.
Washing machine would
probably explode, right?
I'm a mechanical engineer
who's been able to work
at some pretty
cool companies,
so I'm no stranger to creating
solutions to problems.
Like, okay, maybe you don't use
weight to create pressure,
but you use compression.
And this way, it wraps
around your entire body
and really, truly stimulates
a feeling of being hugged.
And, Angie,
what's your background?
So I'm a therapist.
I have a master's degree
in community psychology.
I specialize in the treatment
of anxiety disorders
for kids and adolescents.
So I knew,
more than a lot of people,
how important sleep is ??
not just for our
physical health,
but our mental health, too,
so when he told me this idea,
I was already aware of
deep touch pressure therapy,
not only for things like
autism, which is what it
was originally designed for,
but for anxiety disorders,
for post?traumatic stress
disorders.
Deep touch pressure therapy
is basically gentle
but firm pressure
applied to the body
Okay, the question is here ??
how much time and energy
do you have to spend explaining
the merits of the product
to acquire the customer?
So our cost of acquisition
has been phenomenal.
What is it?
$11.50 blended.
Wow.
And that's over
the last six months.
Very good.
And this is scalable.
Primarily on Facebook?
Yeah.
So we're running PPC campaigns
on Facebook and Instagram.
What'd you do last month?
What did you do last month?
So last month was
our highest revenue month ever.
We did 50,000
last month.
And were you profitable?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so how much
did you make in profits?
So our net profit is usually
about 41% of our top line sales,
so it was
about 22,000.
Good for you.
That's awesome.
Congrats.
Yeah. Thank you.
You're killing it.
And we did bootstrap
this company
with $2,500.
Yeah, baby!
That's all you've put in?
That is all we put in,
and we were profitable
within the first
week or two of selling.
I hope everybody at home
is hearing that.
Alright. What are you gonna
use the 150,000 for?
So demand has been crazy,
and we really need inventory.
I get it.
So ?? I like it.
I want to offer you
$150,000 for 20%.
Well, thank you
for that offer.
Yes, thank you.
Would you like to say yes?
So I don't want to
drop valuation that much.
You can counter.
What's your
counter, Matt?
O'Leary: I'm intrigued also
because of one thing.
John: Kevin, why don't you
let him answer?
He was about to
say something.
It may make it
better for you!
Maybe my offer will just make
Daymond's evaporate.
That's why you don't have to
worry about countering.
Well, maybe we could just make
<i>you</i> evaporate.
[ Chuckles ]
No, I'd just look
at it and say
that you know your
customer acquisition cost.
Mundt: Mm?hmm.
I would just like to pour more
money onto that very model.
The value I would add here
is to drive
that acquisition cost down.
I'll do the deal at 15%.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for the offer.
Thank you.
Are you gonna accept it?
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna give you an offer.
Whoa.
My offer would be
$150,000 also for the 15%.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, and I guess there's
something I want to make
sure I put out there.
There are a lot of
people suffering from
anxiety, sleeplessness.
We're not getting
a lot of hugs.
[ Chuckles ]
And so this really is something
that hugs you back,
even if you are alone.
I personally really benefit
from the Sleep Pod.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sniffles ]
[ Voice breaking ]
Because one of my best
memories from childhood
was being tucked in
by my mom every night.
[ Exhales sharply ]
The reason I went
into psychology
is I lost my mom
to suicide when I was 17.
And through all
of that pain,
I found a passion
for helping other people.
It can help so many people.
I love helping kids.
I'm dedicated to
helping kids,
but there are adults out there
who need help, too.
And this product can fit so many
people and so many needs.
And so I want to make sure that
we make a deal with somebody
who's just as passionate
about this as we are.
You know, I love it, guys.
And I've got people in my
household and my family
that have sensory issues,
so that's why
it's very close to me.
And so I'll make you
an offer.
I'll give you a choice.
I'm gonna give you two offers.
One will be just
what you asked for ??
$150,000 for 10%.
And the one I'd prefer is
$300,000 for 20%.
So that way, we're
closer partners.
That, I think we could
really run with it.
I'll give you the same offer
and the same choices.
Wait a minute.
I'll match the same offer.
and a bidding war is underway
for Angie and Matthew's
therapeutic swaddle
for adults, Hug Sleep.
So, guys, you're going to get
five offers.
I don't know
how often that happens.
Not often.
No.
And look, there's only one
person up here
who actually bled
for you guys.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]
I appreciate that.
Alright, here's
my offer ??
$300,000 for 20%.
That's my offer.
Guys, this is extraordinary
on "Shark Tank."
It is.
What do you guys want to do?
[ Both exhale sharply ]
[ Shakily ] I don't
even know.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I think we certainly
understand the value
that all you Sharks bring, and,
you know, if any of you guys
would be willing
to kind of come together,
I think that's
just going to continue
Lori.
to explode this company.
Alright, Lori and I
will do it together.
The 300 for 20.
Well, I think
if you guys are teaming up
and kicking us
to the curb...
Kevin, Daymond,
will you come in?
'Cause I think three Sharks
is better than two.
O'Leary: Ooh,
that's interesting.
John: I think so.
Alright. I'll come in
with Kevin and Robert.
Oh, God.
Three Sharks versus two.
That's interesting.
Herjavec: Three Sharks,
$300,000 for 20%.
O'Leary: Yeah, that's
a tough one.
Oh, my God.
Three's better than two.
a very serious matter ??
back pain.
It's the worst.
We created the world's
simplest back pain relief ??
the Chirp Wheel.
And we'd love to show you
how it works.
But first,
let's go over all of this.
[ Laughs ]
These bubbles represent
those hard?to?reach muscle knots
in your back
and your neck.
Now, most people use
a foam roller
to roll out their backs.
As he rolls out,
there should be enough pressure
to make the bubbles pop,
symbolizing that deep tissue ??
ahhh ?? back pain relief.
[ Crinkling ]
What's that ??
one pop?
Even though it touches
his entire back,
there's just not enough contact
to be effective.
So let's try it again
with the Chirp Wheel.
