Hi, I'm Kanz!
And I'm Sobhan.
And we're seeking
$325,000
in exchange for 10%
of our revolutionary company.
Sharks,
we love fishing!
[ Chuckling ] Oh, yes, we do.
We love fishing so much.
But we experience
a lot of frustration
with the old, traditional
fishing methods.
See, sometimes people
spend more time and energy
fidgeting with
traditional lures
and catching live bait
than they do actually fishing.
Not to mention, who wants
to deal with this...
gross mess?
Ewwww!
We looked at the
nasty baits
and lures available in stores
today but couldn't find
anything that attracted fish
in a simple and efficient way,
so we created it
ourselves.
Introducing
Animated Lure.
Animated Lure is a
rechargeable robotic lure,
the likes of which
the world has never seen.
Once you place Animated Lure
into the water,
you'll notice it starts
to swim on its very own,
mimicking the swim patterns
of real fish.
Oh, wow!
Wow.
If <i>you</i> think it swims
like a real fish,
what are the fish
going to think?
So, why?
[ Chuckling ] Why?
Why spend so much time
and money on traditional lures
and live bait, when
you can use...
Both: Animated Lure?
See how much you can learn
on "Shark Tank?" It's amazing.
Herjavec:
It's amazing, Kevin!
John: Amazing!
Greiner: You know,
I have to ask
Daymond, though ??
O'Leary: Who knew?
Is this different than anything
you've ever used to fish with?
John:
Yeah, I've never seen it.
How often does it rust?
Or, you know,
like, how many times
do you need to
re?buy that unit?
Sanaee: Yeah, yeah.
So, right now we have
about 40 times.
This is with action,
with you catching fish
and stuff like that.
So how long does it
hold a charge for?
So, for different sizes.
For the minis,
up to 45 minutes of swim.
For the classic is
an hour and a half.
For the biggest one you see,
the Salt Water,
the one that's in
production right now,
that's up to
two hours.
What makes you guys
fish experts?
Why should I believe you?
I'm a project manager at
manufacturing facilities and...
And I'm actually a licensed
professional counselor.
I'm working in community mental
health in Collin County.
Well, then,
it makes sense.
[ Chuckles ]
No, no, but it's something
that we saw growing up.
And if I may, my dad and I
used to go fishing all the time,
and I don't share
about my dad too often,
so please bear with me.
Him and I used to go fishing
all the time,
all the way until he was
diagnosed with a lung disease
and concluded
his human experience.
But it was during those times
where we noticed
some of the problems
that exist
with the old, traditional
fishing method.
And so
they have always taught us
to not only
identify problems,
but to try your best
to be part of the solution.
And so these words
meant a lot to me
because it came
from two individuals
that sacrificed everything
to come to this country
so that their children have
an opportunity
to contribute to
the betterment of society.
Also, to take control
of their own destiny.
Where did you come from?
Iran. Iran.
From Persia. Yeah.
Iran.
What do these cost you to make?
What do you sell them for?
And tell us about
your total sales.
Perfect. The landing price
for the Mini is $8.
For the classic,
it's $10.
And what does the
new big one cost?
$16.
For the Mini,
it's retailing at $29.95.
For a Classic,
$32.95.
And for our Salt Water,
it's $79.95.
Greiner: Wow!
Is it all direct or
are you through retail?
There's a huge
margin on the Salt.
Right now, it's majority
on our website.
However, we are
in a few mom?and?pop stores
So, yes. So right now, me and
Sobhan both work full?time jobs.
We have zero debt
in this company.
Good.
We've put everything, our own
money, into this company.
How much did you put in?
$125,000 to get
the ball rolling
so we could
get this done.
You didn't mess around,
did you?
No, no, no, we haven't taken a
penny out of our own company.
Yeah.
Every cent we've earned,
we put back into our company.
John: Do you own the company?
Herjavec:
As you should.
Yes. Equally.
Yes, sir.
I'm thinking the way to sell
this is, forget about fishing.
Put 10 of them in a tank
and call it an aquarium.
You don't have to feed it.
Cuban: Yeah. You know what?
At, like, a restaurant or
something like that.
[ Laughter ]
That is
a good idea!
Greiner:
And it never dies!
That's a great idea.
Cuban: Hey, guys, look,
it really is a good idea.
It really is clever.
But I'm just not a fisherman.
I just don't have
that feel for it.
And so, while I'm proud
of what you've accomplished...
Appreciate you.
...I have to say
I'm out.
That's fine.
No worries. Thank you.
Listen, I am not
a fisherman, either.
I just know a little bit.
And for those reasons,
'cause I don't know,
It's a little too early
for me.
I'm out.
Guys, you're not
really a company.
You're basically
a product right now
because both of you
have real jobs.
And that's nothing
wrong with that.
How do I get my $325,000
back again?
The reality of the situation is,
it's not about what you know ??
it's about who you know,
and we know that you know
that you guys know
a lot of people.
But think about what
you're saying.
I give you $325,000,
then I go to work for you,
opening up big box retail.
I get on the phone,
I fly to meet the buyer
or whatever I have to do,
and I'm working so you,
who have 90% of the company,
can say, "Good dog. Good dog."
And I gave you all the money.
Either I'm going to get a
huge percentage of this company
'cause it's not even worth
$325,000 yet,
or you're gonna come up
with some very creative way
that I get my capital back while
my partners own 90%.
You know,
that's the problem.
That's a royalty deal
he's looking for.
Did you say
"royalty deal," Lori?
Oh. Hark.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
So, here's what I suggest ??
I give you the 325,000,
I get $3 a unit until
I recoup a million bucks.
10% of the company in case
somebody decides to buy it.
That is a
great offer.
Of course it is.
Let me just tell you
where I stand.
There's something you said
that really bothered me.
You said, "It's not
what you know.
It's who you know."
When I started out,
everyone said that to me.
"You're never going to make it.
You don't know anybody."
I was screwed before I started
if I believed that.
It's not who you know.
It's what you make
with what you have.
That's fair.
I respect
the dream
and I really respect
the hustle you guys have...
I appreciate it.
...but this isn't
a business for me.
I think you've got
a long way to go. I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
John: Alright. The product ??
superb, amazing.
Where I'm struggling is,
of course, the valuation.
If I gave you
325 for 10%,
basically,
as you drill down the numbers,
paying yourself and, you know ??
on a 40%, even 50% margin,
you would have to do
almost $35 million
to then take distribution
for me to make my money.
You came here to fish
for a Shark,
but you didn't hook
this one.
I'm out.
Yeah.
Well, then...
all roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful...
and the fish.
What are you
gonna do?
So, our counter would be
20% for half a million dollars.
Cuban: Hello!
Okay, hold on.
And how many dollars
a unit in royalty?
So in this counter,
no royalty.
[ Laughter ]
Ohh! Don't you know
who he is?
I thought we were on
the planet Earth together.
Let me absorb the counter
so I can just
get the essence of it.
[ French accent ]
The essence.
[ Normal voice ] Instead of me
giving you 325 for 10%,
I give you half a million
for 20%,
and I may never see it again.
It may swim away 'cause we don't
know what's gonna happen.
We want some guidance.
We're young.
We're still learning
the ropes.
The first guidance is ??
listen when you have
a real investor on the hook
and don't come back
with a stupid counter.
I have a question.
Do you want him?
That's
a ridiculous counter.
Look, look,
I can't take it.
Are we doing a royalty deal
or not here? Yes or no?
Yes, we'll talk
about that. Yes.
Can we ??
Can we talk about it?
Can you put
the hat?
Alright.
Congratulations, guys.
Kanz: Thank you.
Congrats.
Wow, what a shocker!
