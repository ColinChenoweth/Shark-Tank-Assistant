And I'm Cereal Killer
Chris.
We're here from
North Las Vegas, Nevada,
seeking $125,000
for 10% of our company...
Both:
The Cereal Killerz Kitchen!
We are the first...
And only...
cereal bar
in Las Vegas.
Wait,
what's a cereal bar?
It's a place where your
childhood dreams can come true.
Think back.
It's Saturday morning.
Your favorite cartoons are on,
and you rush to the kitchen
to prepare the perfect
handcrafted bowl of cereal.
Mmm!
Just when you thought Saturdays
couldn't get any better,
in comes the
Cereal Killerz Kitchen,
where every day is Saturday.
At the Cereal Killerz Kitchen,
the opportunities are endless!
You can mix
over 140 different cereals,
50 toppings into
cereal bowls, waffles,
iced coffees, ice cream,
and milkshakes.
You name it!
Your cereal dreams can come true
with any combination!
Sharks,
now's your time to kill it
and join us
on our crazy quest
to take over the cereal world
one bowl at a time.
What do we have?
We have three different things.
So you have
our signature shake.
So this one is, like,
our most popular.
So pretty much, it's hazelnut,
Nutella, chocolate, caramel.
What is in this?!
Okay, so...
you will love that one.
This one ??
You're gonna love the Survivor.
So, we heard
that you love peanut butter
and that you have it
every morning...
Love peanut butter.
...so we gave you
a peanut butter lover's dream.
In your particular ice cream,
it does have chocolate,
and then we added a scoop
of peanut butter ??
That is crazy!
This is amazing!
Really, really,
really good.
Okay, how many calories
in that peanut butter thing?
Uh, probably between
500 and 5,000.
[ Laughter ]
I really
can't tell you.
This is like milkshakes,
like sundaes,
like, this is ??
you're combining everything.
Oh, this is so good!
Ice cream ?? Yeah,
we do pretty much
just
a big difference ??
Pretty much ??
cereal bar,
but we can do
so many different things.
O'Leary: I want to know
what we're investing in.
Is it a retail location?
What are you doing here?
Okay.
We have one open already.
We're opening
our second location.
Herjavec: So you have
one physical location.
You just opened
another one.
Yeah, we're opening
another one.
And then, we're pretty much
in negotiations
for our next three.
I mean, you know the question
everyone's gonna ask.
Yeah.
Are you even open
right now?
Yes. So we've been back open
for about a month and a half now
'cause we were shut down
for three months.
Our first location
is in a dreaded mall.
So the malls
were completely shut down.
No one can go in
or out.
Is that location
even gonna survive?
Honestly,
probably not.
But we already have
a contingency plan for that.
What's the plan?
We're opening up another store
right across the street.
[ Laughter ]
How are you guys gonna afford
all this?
Just leftover money
that we have.
'Cause with our plan, you know,
it's taking about $25,000
to remodel these stores.
How much cash
do you have left?
Uh, personally, probably
about $40,000, $50,000.
How did you come up
with this idea?
I've always loved cereal.
We do have a daughter
that does have a mild case
of Down syndrome.
And she's a chef
in her head,
so she's always like, "What do
you guys want for breakfast?"
And she's always like,
"Cinnamon Toast Crunch."
So that's ?? I was like,
you know what?
I've always thought it should
have been a cereal bar,
so we started doing
the research,
and we're just like,
"Hey, let's try to do it."
So what's your background,
though? Tell us about you.
So I was in insurance
for about 12 years.
It wasn't something
that made me happy.
I didn't love it.
I was going to quit.
The next thing you know,
I get fired 2 weeks
before our wedding.
Oh, no.
What happened?
Honestly,
my performance wasn't there.
It was like I could not
commit to something
I hated doing
every day anymore.
One of the first times
I ever heard somebody take
responsibility for being fired.
Greiner:
I like your honesty.
I respect that.
And for me,
I grew up in Vegas,
lived in Richmond, California,
for a little while.
When we lived
in Richmond,
you know, things were probably
worse as you can get.
We were homeless,
lived in plenty
of homeless shelters,
rescue missions,
couch?surfed, family to family.
But I probably went to
9 different middle schools.
I couldn't read.
But now something clicked.
I read.
Went to college.
Got on the dean's List ??
3.7.
So it was like, hey, you know,
we need to get this up
so we can take care
of our family.
And especially having a daughter
with Down syndrome.
You know,
it is my stepdaughter,
but that's, like,
my pride and joy.
Like, that's really
what made me become a man.
This is not
a proprietary concept.
I mean, it's a great idea.
I get it.
But others could do it,
obviously.
I have a feeling
that none of these locations
that you have so far
make money yet, right?
Well, the second one's not open
'cause we pushed it off.
Well, there is no location
right now.
The one in the mall
is still open.
In the mall.
Yeah, it's still open.
And how much is that
losing a month?
Probably right now,
about $8,000 a month.
Ouch!
Herjavec: Losing.
Yeah, in that one.
I want to just say to you ??
your story ?? very moving
because you have just come
from remarkable odds.
If I were betting
on entrepreneurs,
I would bet on you 100%.
Thank you, Lori.
I have one conflict here.
I did a deal with
an oatmeal breakfast bar place,
and so, unfortunately,
I try not to do something
that is a conflict
with something
that we are trying
to build.
Are trying to build.
I understand.
And so only for that reason,
I have to be out.
Okay.
