here in the United States.
We also have
a distributor in Canada.
We're in about
40 stores there.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tate Stock.
O'Leary: Okay, Tate.
So I'm going to give you
that special moment
to explain why this is worth
$45 million.
So, this year so far,
we've done $12 million in sales.
What?!
12 million?
Correct.
12?
Correct. $12 million sales
this year. $4 million profit.
By the end of this year,
we expect to do
$40 million in sales
with $12 million
in profit.
So what is it
that you need from a Shark?
That's a great question.
like, crash, Tate,
after that comment.
A 45?year?old
entrepreneur knows
not to offer 2% to anybody,
so...
So, also with our hyper growth,
we need funding for P. O. s.
But you said you just had
$4 million
in cash this year, right?
Greiner: But you're
making money.
You have $4 million
in profit.
We are making money,
but our P. O. that's in right now
but Daymond questions Tate's
motives for coming to the Tank
with his back wheel business,
Chirp,
when he might not need
the investment.
Why take the carpet from
somebody who needs the money?
We believe
that the Chirp wheel
needs to be
in every home in America.
So do not care
about anybody else
who desperately
needs the money.
He's trying
to grow his business.
I'm asking the man
a question.
Well, if he grows big enough,
he can hire more people,
so there you go.
I am genuine on this carpet
about looking for a deal.
I want to have a creative offer
for you guys
where you guys
make your money back fast.
If we do over $100 million
in sales next year,
I would love to cut <i>you</i> a check
for the million dollars,
what you invested back
into the company.
So if I gave you an offer
right now
for $900,000 for 2%,
you're telling me
that you would give it back
to me at the end of the year?
The end of <i>next</i> year.
So, I will give you that offer
if you will do that.
You want creativity,
here it comes.
I like sales.
You've got sales, alright?
I can get you 15% less on
your customer acquisition costs.
Whatever you're doing,
my team can do it better.
That's what I believe,
alright?
[ Laughter ]
Love it.
I'll give you the $900,000
for 2.5% equity,
Tate, you're a good salesperson,
right?
You're obviously doing well.
I just get the sense
that there is a COVID element
that's really escalated
your sales
that aren't gonna be
straight line up
to justify the valuation.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate your feedback.
Thanks, Mark.
Tate, the one thing I do know
is sales never lie ?? ever.
You've hit magic.
Tate, you can absorb
the $1.50 per unit.
Yes, it is a royalty.
It's the first time in 12 years
I've made a royalty deal.
You have learned,
grasshopper.
Greiner:
Why are you afraid?
If you're gonna make the money
you're gonna make ??
I don't have a problem with
that. Neither should you,
because of your cost
of goods.
Let Tate make a decision!
Tate, it's up to you.
What are you gonna do?
Lori, we'd pay you back
$400,000 this year,
$500,000 next year.
You recoup your entire
investment
in the next 18 months ??
no risk.
We don't have to tie it
to $100 million,
Oh! Either you want the partner
or you don't, Tate.
I mean, seriously.
You have no partners,
Tate.
Yeah,
you have no partners.
Maybe it should be 4%.
[ Laughs ]
You have 97.5% left.
[ Laughs ]
Lori, you got a deal.
Okay!
Whoo?hoo!
Oh, my gosh!
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: Congrats.
Thanks.
Oh, my gosh!
[ Laughs ]
Aaaah!
Pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop!
What up, what up,
what up? Whooo!
O'Leary: Lori, you make nothing
on your money
till he sells his company ??
maybe.
That's <i>every</i> investment.
When my money leaves,
it comes back with prisoners!
Your money never gets
any prisoners!
It comes back
after 2 years saying,
"Do I still live here
with Lori?
I'm not sure
I ever left this place."
Free money from Lori!
Lori, free money!"
Moving on. Moving on.
