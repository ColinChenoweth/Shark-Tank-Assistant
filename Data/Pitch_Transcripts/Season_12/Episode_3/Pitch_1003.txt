here in the United States.
We also have
a distributor in Canada.
We're in about
40 stores there.
What about the big boys?
Bass and all the rest?
That's where we're hoping to
make a deal, and we don't know.
Ohhh!
They'll pick up
<i>your</i> phone calls, for sure.
Okay, but while we're still
talking dollars...
Sure.
Yes.
...and costs.
$325,000, 10% imputes
a $3.25 million value.
You must be selling
a lot of mechanical fish.
2020 to date,
we're at $247,000.
Good for you.
We're projecting
for this year
half a million dollars in sales,
and then, even next year,
$675,000 in sales.
You guys are
making money right now?
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Tate Stock.
My business is Chirp,
and we're here about
O'Leary: Okay, Tate.
So I'm going to give you
that special moment
to explain why this is worth
$45 million.
So, this year so far,
we've done $12 million in sales.
What?!
12 million?
Correct.
12?
Correct. $12 million sales
this year. $4 million profit.
By the end of this year,
we expect to do
$40 million in sales
with $12 million
in profit.
So what is it
that you need from a Shark?
That's a great question.
The wheel is simple,
and it's effective.
We've sold over a million
of them.
I have 5 people
in front of me
that are the greatest investors
in America,
and you guys are sitting
on things that I don't know.
I read over 60 books a year,
but I'm 28 years old,
and I want to have the mind?set
of a 45?year?old entrepreneur.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, I'm not buying
any of that...
That's the worst.
...because if there's
one thing you know,
you know how to sell
$12 million of a round wheel.
Yeah, your pitch
just went downhill,
like, crash, Tate,
after that comment.
A 45?year?old
entrepreneur knows
not to offer 2% to anybody,
so...
So, also with our hyper growth,
we need funding for P. O. s.
But you said you just had
$4 million
in cash this year, right?
Greiner: But you're
making money.
You have $4 million
in profit.
We are making money,
but our P. O. that's in right now
is for $4 million,
and so ??
From who? Who are you getting
theses P. O. s from?
All B2C. So we mainly sell
through our website.
How do you market them
to get to your website?
Mainly through
social channels ??
Instagram and Facebook.
Our cost to acquire a customer
is about $20 to $30.
That's high.
Herjavec: So what did
you spend on marketing
last year ?? this year?
We've spent about
$3 million.
So, when COVID hit
in March,
we had 3 months of inventory,
and we ran out in 3 weeks.
When we've sold out ??
we've actually been missing out
on about $4 million
a month in sales.
What's the price
for a 3?pack?
3?pack is 99 bucks.
Our cost ??
What's your cost?
COGs on it landed are $21.96
for the 3?pack.
It's about $6, $8,
and $10 for individual.
Comes from China?
They're manufactured
in Taiwan.
Do you have any debt?
No.
Do you have any partners?
No partners.
You don't have any debt,
zero partners,
and you're doing
those kind of numbers.
Are you really here
to make a deal?
Honestly,
I am here to make a deal.
So why the 2%?
Why come in at all?
You do realize a lot of people
right now don't have jobs.
They don't have
a career.
Correct.
You know, a lot of people
will close their businesses,
and they'll never come back.
Why take the carpet from
somebody who needs the money?
but Daymond questions Tate's
motives for coming to the Tank
with his back wheel business,
Chirp,
when he might not need
the investment.
Why take the carpet from
somebody who needs the money?
We believe
that the Chirp wheel
needs to be
in every home in America.
So do not care
about anybody else
who desperately
needs the money.
He's trying
to grow his business.
I'm asking the man
a question.
Well, if he grows big enough,
he can hire more people,
so there you go.
I am genuine on this carpet
about looking for a deal.
I want to have a creative offer
for you guys
where you guys
make your money back fast.
If we do over $100 million
in sales next year,
I would love to cut <i>you</i> a check
for the million dollars,
what you invested back
into the company.
So if I gave you an offer
right now
for $900,000 for 2%,
you're telling me
that you would give it back
to me at the end of the year?
The end of <i>next</i> year.
So, I will give you that offer
if you will do that.
You want creativity,
here it comes.
I like sales.
You've got sales, alright?
I can get you 15% less on
your customer acquisition costs.
Whatever you're doing,
my team can do it better.
That's what I believe,
alright?
[ Laughter ]
Love it.
I'll give you the $900,000
for 2.5% equity,
and I want a royalty
of $3 a unit
till I get back
$2.7 million.
So I'm basically
doubling my dough,
[ Laughs ]
and I don't have
a time limit.
I'm not putting you
under pressure on time
'cause poo?poo
happens in businesses,
and I don't know
what's gonna happen to you.
But remember one thing ??
there's only one Mr. Wonderful.
Thank God for that.
Tate, you're a good salesperson,
right?
You're obviously doing well.
I just get the sense
that there is a COVID element
that's really escalated
your sales
that aren't gonna be
straight line up
to justify the valuation.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate your feedback.
Thanks, Mark.
Tate, the one thing I do know
is sales never lie ?? ever.
You've hit magic.
And how long it's gonna last,
I don't know.
But I want to go along
for the ride.
$900,000
for 3% of the company.
You pay me back $1.50
off every wheel
until I recover
$1.2 million.
Okay.
Would you guys consider
going in on a deal?
With Kevin?
Are you kidding me?
[ Chuckling ] No, no, no.
[ Lori laughs ]
I love ya.
I'm a huge fan.
But I want
Lori and Robert.
Why would I want to partner?
I'll give you
the $900,000.
You'll pay back
$500,000 this year
and $500,000 next year.
Okay.
And I'll do that
for 2.5%.
2.5% or 2%?
2.5%.
Was your original deal 2%?
It was.
[ Laughter ]
Tate, you can absorb
the $1.50 per unit.
Yes, it is a royalty.
It's the first time in 12 years
I've made a royalty deal.
You have learned,
grasshopper.
Greiner:
Why are you afraid?
If you're gonna make the money
you're gonna make ??
I don't have a problem with
that. Neither should you,
because of your cost
of goods.
Let Tate make a decision!
Tate, it's up to you.
What are you gonna do?
Lori, we'd pay you back
$400,000 this year,
$500,000 next year.
You recoup your entire
investment
in the next 18 months ??
no risk.
We don't have to tie it
to $100 million,
and we'll do it at 2%.
Oh! Either you want the partner
or you don't, Tate.
I mean, seriously.
You have no partners,
Tate.
Yeah,
you have no partners.
Maybe it should be 4%.
[ Laughs ]
You have 97.5% left.
[ Laughs ]
Lori, you got a deal.
Okay!
Whoo?hoo!
Oh, my gosh!
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: Congrats.
Thanks.
Oh, my gosh!
[ Laughs ]
Aaaah!
Pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop!
What up, what up,
what up? Whooo!
O'Leary: Lori, you make nothing
on your money
till he sells his company ??
maybe.
That's <i>every</i> investment.
When my money leaves,
it comes back with prisoners!
Your money never gets
any prisoners!
It comes back
after 2 years saying,
"Do I still live here
with Lori?
I'm not sure
I ever left this place."
Free money from Lori!
Lori, free money!"
Moving on. Moving on.
[ Laughter ]
