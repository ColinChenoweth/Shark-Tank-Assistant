Hey, Sharks.
I'm Khasha Touloei.
And I'm Maynard Okereke.
We're from
Los Angeles, California,
and we're asking
for $250,000
in return for 20% equity
in our company, JADA Spices.
Can you believe
we're still cooking up
some of our favorite dishes
with the same basic salts
we've been using since
the days of the caveman?
Since caveman times,
the only evolution in seasoning
has been the addition
of unhealthy ingredients,
like MSG, animal byproducts,
and higher sodium levels.
But just like humans
have changed over time,
the way we season our foods
has also evolved.
Introducing the latest
evolution in seasoning...
[ Laughter ]
Both: Vegan chicken salt!
Whoa.
Touloei: Vegan chicken salt
is a turmeric?based,
all?purpose seasoning
that enhances the flavor
of any dish
while providing incredible
health benefits.
Are you trying
to eat healthier,
but your vegan chili recipe
keeps turning out bland?
Throw some
chicken salt on it.
Are you tired of the
same old buttered popcorn?
Throw some
chicken salt on it.
People love our seasoning
as a healthy alternative
to basic table salt,
and vegans especially love it
as a healthy substitute
to chicken bouillon.
We've also expanded our line
to include additional flavors,
such as reduced sodium,
lime, red pepper, barbecue,
and our new, innovative
product, turmeric salt.
Well, hold on.
JADA Spices is more than
just a seasoning company.
We're providing consumers
with healthy and
plant?based products,
including a new
plant?based chicken
that's gonna take the evolution
of food to the next level.
So, help us be a part of
mankind's greatest evolution
and take a leap
out of the Stone Age
by giving every kitchen the
ability to cook up healthy meals
without compromising
flavor.
So, come on, Sharks ??
don't be a chicken.
Both: Who's ready
to try some samples?
?We are.
?I'm starving.
?We can try.
?Okay, so, what do we have?
So, you'll notice
right there in front of you,
we have six of our SKUs ??
five of our
chicken salt flavors
and our turmeric
salt seasoning.
You have some French fries,
and you have a skewer
that has avocados,
tomatoes, and cucumbers,
and you also have
some popcorn there.
People love using our seasoning
as a popcorn seasoning.
Is this your
meatless chicken?
That is our chicken, yes.
That's your product?
Yes.
What is a
plant?based chicken?
I would have no idea
what that is.
So, currently
on the market,
there are some
plant?based chickens.
They all have soy.
They all have high sodium.
They all need
to be refrigerated.
They all have a whole
bunch of ingredients
that I can't pronounce.
We have created
this plant?based chicken.
It doesn't need
to be refrigerated.
You're able to mold it
into any shape.
You can make it a nugget.
So it comes like
ground chicken, almost?
Or how does it come?
It comes in a packet.
It comes in a mix.
So it comes
as a dry powder
and you add oil and water to it
to create the paste?
That's why it doesn't
have to be refrigerated.
What?
Exactly.
All you have is a package
with our dry mix,
and then you just add
3/4 cup of water...
And it turns into chicken?
...and a tablespoon of oil.
That's it?
Yes.
Now, how many calories
is in a patty?
Per serving, you're getting
20 grams of protein.
You're getting
no cholesterol, no sugar.
You're getting 120 calories,
and, furthermore, you're
getting very low sodium.
What's in the chicken?
So, it's a very,
very clean recipe, okay?
We have like
seven ingredients.
The protein is from textured
wheat protein and pea protein.
The fiber is
from pea fiber.
A lot of vegans lack B12.
We have B12 in there.
That chicken's really good.
This chicken's really good.
Appreciate that.
Thank you, thank you.
Let me tell you guys ??
it tastes exactly like chicken.
Greiner:
What's your background?
So, we met in college
at University of Washington,
and it was always our goal
to start a business together.
I'm first?generation here
to the country.
My mom's side's from Cameroon.
My dad's side is from Nigeria.
They immigrated here
to the U. S.,
and all my life, I watched
my parents grind and hustle
just to make ends meet
and put foods on our plate.
I graduated high school
the top of my class.
I got a full?ride scholarship
to the University of Washington.
I studied civil and
environmental engineering,
but it just
wasn't my passion.
I was a creative at heart.
Music was always
something I loved,
and so I left engineering,
and I went down to Los Angeles
to pursue music.
And I work right now
as a science communicator.
I actually have a platform
called Hip Hop Science,
"Look, Khasha, there's no way
you're getting into dermatology.
Your grades
aren't good enough.
Your board scores
aren't good enough."
And I wasn't gonna let these
dream?killers kill my dream,
and, basically, I just
outworked everybody.
So you got into derma??
I got into dermatology.
Wow.
John: Good for you.
So, are you a doctor now?
Are you practicing ??
I'm a dermatologist
right now.
Chicken salt's a big
phenomenon in Australia.
When you go to a
restaurant, there's salt,
pepper, chicken salt.
Everyone uses chicken salt.
So we took the chicken salt
from Australia,
we made it vegan,
we got rid of the chicken stock,
we got rid of the MSG,
and we lowered the sodium.
What's your average selling
price and your average cost?
Yeah, so,
it costs us 80 cents
to make one of those landed
in our warehouse.
In retail,
we sell at $4.99.
Wow.
On Amazon,
we're at $8.99,
So we're the number?one?selling
seasoned salt
on Amazon
numerous times.
Is that right?
We're outselling Lawry's.
At a three?times?higher
price point than Lawry's.
We did $319,000 last year,
with a $60,000
in EBITDA.
What about this year?
What are you gonna do this year?
We're projected to do
$500,000 this year.
And furthermore,
I want to emphasize ??
we're not just
a seasoning company.
We're really excited about
this plant?based chicken.
We think it's gonna
change the game.
Greiner: Bingo.
That's what I want
to ask you about.
Okay, so,
for me, personally,
I'm not as interested
in the salt.
Okereke: Mm?hmm.
What I find
exceptionally different ??
that patty tasted
really good.
Mm?hmm.
Thank you.
So how much of that is going
to be your plan going forward?
Chicken is ready to launch.
We've been R&amp;Ding it
for the last couple months.
The recipe's finished.
The ingredients
have been sourced.
We are ready to go.
You both have full?time jobs.
How are you doing all that?
No, we do this
both full time.
Like, trust me,
Khasha and I put all ??
He's a doctor.
He's a dermatologist.
And I run
my own business.
I'm an independent contractor,
so I put my time as needed.
My dream is to
pursue this full time.
I work on this
before I get to work,
during lunch,
between patients,
in the evening,
and on the weekends.
Khasha's the only one
that could go from doing
Good for you.
a skin cancer removal to
negotiating a distributor deal
literally within
10 minutes.
What I'm having
a problem with is,
you both have successful
real jobs, okay?
This is a side hustle
that's done very well.
No, no, no, this is not
a side hustle.
Their real job
is the side hustle.
Just 'cause we have
successful jobs doesn't mean
that that's our passion.
Okay, let me put it
to you this way ??
"Hi. I'd like to speak
to the CEO of my spice company."
"I'm sorry.
He's seeing a patient."
"Okay, how about
the other guy?"
"I'm sorry.
He's being an engineer."
To me, you're
all over the map.
Focus, baby. Focus.
That's what I invest in.
You don't have it.
I'm out.
Khasha and Maynard have an offer
on the table from Barbara
for their vegan chicken salt
company, JADA Spices.
I'm going to
give you the $250,000,
but I want 33%.
