Hey, Sharks.
I'm Khasha Touloei.
Touloei: Vegan chicken salt
is a turmeric?based,
all?purpose seasoning
that enhances the flavor
of any dish
while providing incredible
health benefits.
Are you trying
to eat healthier,
"Look, Khasha, there's no way
you're getting into dermatology.
Your grades
aren't good enough.
Your board scores
aren't good enough."
Okereke: Mm?hmm.
What I find
exceptionally different ??
that patty tasted
really good.
Mm?hmm.
Thank you.
So how much of that is going
to be your plan going forward?
Chicken is ready to launch.
We've been R&amp;Ding it
for the last couple months.
The recipe's finished.
The ingredients
have been sourced.
We are ready to go.
You both have full?time jobs.
How are you doing all that?
No, we do this
both full time.
Khasha's the only one
that could go from doing
Good for you.
a skin cancer removal to
negotiating a distributor deal
literally within
10 minutes.
What I'm having
a problem with is,
you both have successful
real jobs, okay?
This is a side hustle
that's done very well.
No, no, no, this is not
a side hustle.
Their real job
is the side hustle.
Just 'cause we have
successful jobs doesn't mean
that that's our passion.
Okay, let me put it
to you this way ??
"Hi. I'd like to speak
to the CEO of my spice company."
"I'm sorry.
He's seeing a patient."
"Okay, how about
the other guy?"
"I'm sorry.
He's being an engineer."
To me, you're
all over the map.
Focus, baby. Focus.
That's what I invest in.
You don't have it.
I'm out.
