where I utilize my
background in civil and
environmental engineering
and my passion for
hip hop, pop culture
to educate people on different
complex scientific subjects.
So, I was born in Iran.
I spent my younger years
in England and Australia.
My dad finally
caught a break,
and we moved to the States,
and he got a job at Boeing.
And unfortunately, my father
developed multiple sclerosis.
Ohh.
And within that year,
he became quadriplegic.
Oh, my gosh.
The following year, I went
to University of Washington.
I had to work full time
in order to support my family
and support myself.
I worked cleaning floors.
When I was at
University of Washington,
there was nothing more that I
wanted to be ?? an entrepreneur.
But just with a lack
of security growing up,
I picked a secure field,
and I pursued medicine.
When I got into medical
school, they told me,
I just think that's
too long for me, so I'm out.
that wants to utilize
our seasoning
for some of their custom
recipes, which is gonna be
six?figure contracts
from just that one alone.
You guys have enough energy
for 10 entrepreneurs
as a part?time job.
[ Laughing ] Yeah.
I love the fact that
you're squeezing this in
over your regular jobs.
You've almost made <i>them</i>
part?time instead.
I have no doubt in my mind
you're gonna succeed.
Thank you.        Thank you.
And if I could offer
one thing I might be able to do,
is slow you down a little bit
on some of your choices.
You're all over the board,
and I love it,
but I want more skin
in the game.
I'm going to
give you the $250,000,
but I want 33%.
If you'd had that
further along,
for me, that's
your winner, your hero.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Hey, Sharks!
I'm Jordan!
And I'm Liz!
We're a mom?and?son team
from Newton, Massachusetts,
and we're here
seeking $200,000
for 8% equity
in our company.
Sharks, if you couldn't tell,
we're pretty close.
And our family
loves a celebration.
Everyone knows a party without
a cake is no party at all.
But there hasn't been
much innovation with cakes.
Both: Until now!
Introducing Surprise Cake!
With our reusable,
patented popping stand,
you can now hide gifts
inside cakes that ??
Jordan, how can they
take us seriously?
We're in a cake.
You're right, Mom.
Let's get out of here.
Jordan: Yep, you all have
custom gifts.
I'm not gonna say
what I got.
How'd you come up
with this crazy idea?
The night before my
daughter's 12th birthday,
I actually had a dream
that I hid her birthday present
inside of her
birthday cake.
The next day,
I did just that,
and as she was
blowing out her candles,
I called her phone,
and the cake rang.
Everybody loved it.
Whoa! Great idea.
And I knew in that moment
that this could be
a great business ??
hiding gifts in cake.
And then, as I was getting ready
to start the business,
I hit a roadblock known
as the Kinder Egg Law,
Oh.
which prohibits putting
non?edible objects
inside of
confectionery products.
But after giving it some
thought, it occurred to me
that if instead of
putting the gifts
directly into the cake,
you place them in a cake stand,
problem is solved.
What are your backgrounds?
Like, what do you do?
In my previous life,
I was a lawyer.
I actually worked for the
Department of Correction
in Massachusetts.
Kevin, run.
And what about you?
What do you do?
Okay, so, I graduated
from college 2 1/2 years ago
as an industrial engineer.
So, did you design this?
We've worked with
a product designer
who is an expert in design
for manufacturing.
It took us
almost three years
to get it to this point
where it's at now.
So, do you have
a patent on this?
We have
a utility patent.
It's fully approved
in the United States.
We've filed internationally,
in the EU, Canada, Australia.
Just curious what comes
in the products,
'cause we have this
great cake here, but ??
So, up until now, we've been
selling the popping cake stand,
which is the cake stand
that the cake is on,
but one of the big
reasons we're here
is because we're looking
to scale this business
into a one?stop shop
for Surprise Cakes.
What that's gonna include is,
of course, the popping stand,
the cakes, and also,
the gifts to go inside.
The baked cake?
A baked cake.
A baked cake, yes.
Okay, now, hold on there,
Baba Looey.
Cuban: Wonder what
you're gonna talk about.
What are you gonna
talk about, Kevin?
I want to talk about the cake
industry, 'cause I'm in it...
Please do.
...and I've been in it
for almost 10 years.
They are completely
different businesses,
and you should
really reconsider,
because what you're
selling is a product
that has no spoilage,
doesn't have
a shelf?life issue.
Cakes have all kinds of
issues around their freshness,
when they're shipped,
how they're shipped.
Why would you want to
do that to yourself?
Liz: Our customers keep
asking for it,
so we thought this would
be a way to go, but ??
Cuban: Let me just
tell you something.
Listening to your customers
is way overrated.
The job of a customer
is just to enjoy ??
not to predict,
not to understand your business,
not to give you guidelines
on where to go ??
just to enjoy
your product or service.
What happened to "The customer
is always right," Mark?
Yeah, that's wrong.
[ Laughter ]
One thing I want to ask you,
though ?? my guess is,
the reason you're deciding
to go into the cake business
is 'cause you're not selling
enough stands without a cake.
Can you tell us
what your sales are there?
Jordan: Yeah, absolutely.
So, we started
2 1/2 years ago.
We launched in
the summer of 2018.
In that first
five months in business,
we did just
$10,000 in sales.
2019, we did
$280,000 in sales,
and year to date, we've done
$550,000 in sales.
Good for you.
Congratulations.
Our run rate is projected
to be $900,000.
So, you think you're gonna
end the year at $900,000?
Yeah.
What's your profit on that?
We're gonna net $50,000.
$50,000?
But why so little?
I don't see
where you guys ??
We have 3 1/2 full?time
employees right now
that we're
paying salary to.
And how much do you sell it for?
How much is it?
The popping cake stand
alone is $36.99.
Plus, we charge
$7.99 for shipping.
The landed cost of
the popping stand is $8.
Okay, 'cause
you're not gonna
sell too many of these
<i>again</i> to anybody.
You're gonna
sell them once, right?
No, 'cause they have
more than one kid.
I guess you could sell ??
you could reuse it, right?
Use it again and again.
You could reuse it, but that's
where the gift pods come in.
We want to sell gift pods
for every occasion, every theme.
Liz: Exactly ??
curated gift pods.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Curated gift pods?
Yes.
You mean, you want to suggest
what the gift is
that I should give
to my kid?
Exactly.
Another bad idea, but...
Another <i>really</i> bad idea.
Okay, guys, look ??
there are certain horrible
mistakes that companies make.
You guys are drowning
in your revenue attempts.
So many companies
get so amped up.
You hit $100,000 in sales.
[ Exhales sharply ]
You hit $500,000 in sales.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Now you're on a mission to hit
a million, then $2 million,
and you're trying to come up
with all these ways
just to grow that top line
because it's almost like
an ego boost,
as opposed to
the bottom line.
You're chasing revenue
and not chasing profits,
and so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thanks for that advice.
I'm gonna go back
to my concept ??
Before you go back, could you
straighten out your hat?
It's driving me crazy.
It makes you look weird.
I think it's so funny.
This is how I wear it.
Okay.
You wear your birthday hat the
way you wear <i>your</i> birthday hat.
Okay, fine.
Corcoran: You know, Jordan,
you have a winner on your hands.
With that amount of sales,
you should be turning
a much bigger profit.
You have
a successful company ??
one moment ??
but you haven't figured out
how to get money out of it,
so I'm out.
Okay. Thank you
for that advice.
Thank you.
Look, there's nothing
wrong with this,
and you're selling fun,
and you've got a little work
ahead of you,
but the cake idea
freaked me out ??
but that's only 'cause
I'm in the business.
I mean, I forbid you
to do that.
I'm out.
Greiner:
So, I love the idea.
I think this can become
family tradition for people.
Exactly.
It already has.
I think every New Year's ??
money inside or whatever.
Exactly.
But you came in
asking for $200,000 for 8%.
You valued it so high.
We'll work on the
valuation with you.
We'd love to do that.
Make an offer to her.
John: You can counter.
Jordan: The Sharks disagree
with our vision
for a one?stop shop
for Surprise Cake.
We didn't agree.
We're gonna push ahead,
and I know we're gonna do well.
And they're gonna
really regret it.
He's no longer with us.
Somebody has to carry on
this great tradition.
And I tried to figure out,
"Is it Dad?
Is it my husband?
Is it my brother?"
So, my guys love chainsaws
and power tools.
They're just
power tool freaks.
And that's when
I thought, "Wow,
if this was a power tool,
they'd all be fighting over it."
[ Laughter ]
Greiner:
So this was your idea?
Yes.
From start to finish.
Is there any way to
have a childproof lock
or anything like that?
Because that'd be
my greatest fear ??
my 11?year?old would grab it
and go Jason on everything.
Well,
you got to remember, too,
that they've been around
for a long time.
So you lock up
your regular knives ??
Well, no,
I get that, right?
But it doesn't look
as enticing as this.
You'd want to put it up
and put it in a safe place
in the cabinets
and everywhere else.
Where are you selling
these primarily?
So, we went to the International
Housewares Show last March,
and we picked up some big
resellers right off the bat ??
Sharper Image, Grommet,
Ace Hardware.
In the stores?
The physical retailers?
We just got our purchase orders
while we were here for that.
So, guys, this is very easy
to demonstrate visually.
And you could sell
direct?to?customer, full margin.
Yes.
Yes.
Why aren't you
doing more of that?
That's what our plan is.
Our goal is to get ??
We got kind of skewed toward
the resellers right now.
Like, 90% of our business
is with resellers.
I need to get that back to
buying direct to the consumer
off of our website,
'cause right now,
we're splitting the money
with everybody.
Right, right, right.
I'd rather bring it
back our way.
Alright. Break down
the numbers for me.
So, we've sold
8,500 units.
And in how many
months was that?
The past 12 months.
12 months.
What was the total
sales figure?
$163,000 last year.
We've sold $41,000
year?to?date.
So, what does it cost you
to manufacture,
and what do you
sell it for?
Alright, so, it's $20
landed here in the U. S.
We sell them
for $69 to $89 retail.
What does a typical
electric knife sell for?
Just a regular, plain
electric knife?
I mean, if a chef
puts their name on it,
it could be $169,
but you can get the
cheapest one at a box store
for maybe 19, 20 bucks.
Do you have a patent
or any type of coverage on it?
Yes, we have a design patent
and a Chinese patent.
And it's pretty broad.
Anybody that tries
to make anything
that looks like a chainsaw
on an electric knife ??
That's all you need.
Yeah, that's all you need.
Okay, it's very demonstrable.
I'm making the assumption,
with the right digital buy
and a 59?second video,
you could sell a ton of these
at Thanksgiving.
Yeah.
Greiner:
Have you done that?
Have you done any videos
or digital marketing?
Mm?hmm.
You did $41,000 this year
and $163,000 last year?
So, what part of that came
from those digital ads?
10%.
10%?
Mm?hmm.
That's all?
Why do you think
they didn't work better?
We were early. We were doing
some marketing early.
A lot of this is
showing up organically.
Like, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>
did an article on us.
We sold 300 the next day.
When did you run those ads?
What time of year?
That was November 17th.
That next Monday,
Kim and I flew back
from a dance competition
and shipped out 300.
What dance competition?
You were dancing?
We're ballroom dancers.
You are?
What?!
You are living
the best life ever.
[ Laughter ]
Guys, guys,
I'm interested in this,
'cause it kind of fits
into my Chef Wonderful world,
and I could actually get
behind it, shoot some videos.
I've got three studios
I shoot commercials in.
I'll do the deal ??
$100,000 for 33.3%
You know, three amigos.
I want to be a third partner.
O'Leary:
You waited too long, Barbara.
It just shows you ??
you snooze, you lose.
You're squawking like a chicken.
The deal just dances out.
Oh, my God.
