I just think that's
too long for me, so I'm out.
that wants to utilize
our seasoning
for some of their custom
recipes, which is gonna be
six?figure contracts
from just that one alone.
You guys have enough energy
for 10 entrepreneurs
as a part?time job.
[ Laughing ] Yeah.
I love the fact that
you're squeezing this in
over your regular jobs.
You've almost made <i>them</i>
part?time instead.
I have no doubt in my mind
you're gonna succeed.
Thank you.        Thank you.
If you'd had that
further along,
for me, that's
your winner, your hero.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Hey, Sharks!
I'm Jordan!
Jordan, how can they
take us seriously?
We're in a cake.
You're right, Mom.
Let's get out of here.
Jordan: Yep, you all have
custom gifts.
I'm not gonna say
what I got.
How'd you come up
with this crazy idea?
The night before my
daughter's 12th birthday,
I actually had a dream
that I hid her birthday present
inside of her
birthday cake.
The next day,
I did just that,
Liz: Our customers keep
asking for it,
so we thought this would
be a way to go, but ??
Cuban: Let me just
tell you something.
Listening to your customers
is way overrated.
The job of a customer
is just to enjoy ??
Can you tell us
what your sales are there?
Jordan: Yeah, absolutely.
So, we started
2 1/2 years ago.
We launched in
the summer of 2018.
In that first
five months in business,
we did just
$10,000 in sales.
2019, we did
$280,000 in sales,
Liz: Exactly ??
curated gift pods.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Curated gift pods?
Yes.
You mean, you want to suggest
what the gift is
that I should give
to my kid?
Exactly.
Another bad idea, but...
Another <i>really</i> bad idea.
Okay, guys, look ??
there are certain horrible
mistakes that companies make.
You guys are drowning
in your revenue attempts.
So many companies
get so amped up.
You hit $100,000 in sales.
[ Exhales sharply ]
You hit $500,000 in sales.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Now you're on a mission to hit
a million, then $2 million,
Jordan: The Sharks disagree
with our vision
for a one?stop shop
for Surprise Cake.
We didn't agree.
He's no longer with us.
Somebody has to carry on
this great tradition.
that they've been around
for a long time.
So you lock up
your regular knives ??
Well, no,
I get that, right?
But it doesn't look
as enticing as this.
O'Leary:
You waited too long, Barbara.
It just shows you ??
you snooze, you lose.
You're squawking like a chicken.
The deal just dances out.
Oh, my God.
