So, I think there's
a healthy balance
on when your customer's
telling you what you need
and then, yes,
drowning in opportunity.
But, you know,
other people up here
know baked goods better than me,
so I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you so much.
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Lance Burney.
And I'm Kim Burney.
We're from Sanford, Florida,
seeking $100,000
for a 20% equity stake
in our company.
And we've created
a fun new twist
on a family tradition.
We love entertaining
our family and friends,
especially during
the holidays.
This year, instead of
cutting the turkey
with the same old
boring knife,
why not wow your family
and friends with...
[ Whirring ]
Both: ...The Mighty Carver!
[ Laughter ]
Gosh.
The Mighty Carver is
an electric carving knife
that looks, sounds,
and feels like a chainsaw.
Your family and friends
will love it ??
guaranteed to put a smile
on their face.
Not only is it fun,
but it cuts really well.
[ Whirring ]
?[ Laughs ]
?That's great.
?Wow.
?Listen.
Lance: There's a cutting
accessory down there, too,
if you want to
get fun with it.
Greiner: Oh!
Now we're talking!
[ Laughter ]
Nice. [ Laughs ]
And I would start
with the bre??
Bwuah?ha?ha?ha?ha!
[ Laughs ]
[ Whirring ]
This is actually really cool
and really easy.
And the actual handle
gives you leverage
for when you're cutting.
Yeah, it really is.
And when you screw up
like I did, bam.
[ Laughter ]
Kim said yes.
Oh, no!
She's the boss.
Oh, no!
Thank you, guys.
Kim ?? Oh, no!
Dance out! Dance out!
Thank you. We will.
We'll dance out.
Yes, dance out!
John: There you go.
Lance:
We were hearing Mark and Barbara
talking in the background,
but then
when Lori started saying,
"He's serious. He's a fisherman.
You should do the deal,"
I was like, "Okay,
we need to do the deal."
And Kim pulled the trigger, and
it's a done deal. We're happy.
Very happy with Daymond.
You dirty dog, Daymond!
You dirty dog!
