My name is Akeem Shannon.
St. Louis, Missouri,
is where I kick it.
Whoo! Great job!
I'm seeking
a $100,000 investment
for a 20% stake
in my business, Flipstik.
I got to say, that rap was
one of the best raps
we've ever seen
on this stage.
So, who's ready
to see a demo?
Yeah!
Yes, sir.
Awesome.
This is Flipstik.
Flipstik is
a paper?thin device
that goes on the back
of your phone.
Akeem, something's not
adding up. Your sales suck.
$115,000 over two years.
You've been
the number 1 salesperson
everywhere you've gone.
You know 115K is awful.
Right? For real.
60% of our business
is retail,
You don't like it?
if I might, Akeem.
You know, you've got such
a magnetic personality...
Thank you, Barbara.
John: So, here's where
I'm at, Akeem.
I have a similar company.
It doesn't make the same claims
you have, but, you know,
Akeem, how much
did you sell last month?
So, yeah, so, last month,
it was pretty low.
I mean, we're looking
at $1,500.
$1,500.
Yeah.
That's it?
I tell you something ??
I know what you need.
The name of the game
with this product ??
everything about it
is the visual,
O'Leary: Akeem, I'm gonna
make it easy for you.
I'm gonna make
it easy for you.
I made you an offer ??
exactly what you wanted ??
before you told me that
you only sold $1,500,
so, clearly, nothing's
working digitally for you.
I'm not saying
Lori can't do it,
but I'm gonna make it easy.
When I make an offer
on "Shark Tank,"
I am the only
Mr. Wonderful,
Akeem had one offer
on the table from Kevin
offering him exactly
what he came in seeking,
Greiner: Akeem,
I'm a product person,
