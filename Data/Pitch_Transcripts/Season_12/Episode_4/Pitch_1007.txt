My name is Akeem Shannon.
St. Louis, Missouri,
is where I kick it.
Whoo! Great job!
I'm seeking
a $100,000 investment
for a 20% stake
in my business, Flipstik.
I got to say, that rap was
one of the best raps
we've ever seen
on this stage.
So, who's ready
to see a demo?
Yeah!
Yes, sir.
Awesome.
This is Flipstik.
Flipstik is
a paper?thin device
that goes on the back
of your phone.
It comes in over 70 different
designs and colors,
and with a simple flip,
you can sit it down
on any flat surface.
But the magic really starts
when you reveal
our synthetic CT adhesive
Based off the foot
of a gecko,
essentially, it lets you
stick your phone anywhere.
Cool.
And when I say "stick,"
I mean it <i>really</i> sticks.
until you give it
a little twist,
Wow.
Brilliant.
and it comes off
without damaging the surfaces.
But it's not just glass.
Check out this textured
tile surface here.
Flipstik even sticks here
just as well.
And the great thing is,
you can use it in the kitchen
or in the bath.
But it's not just
tile or glass.
Whether it's metal, vinyl,
Flipstik goes where you are.
Check this out.
I have three of the dirtiest
household items here, right?
I have hair, I got sand,
and I got my mama's
homemade spaghetti
straight from the can.
Now, we're gonna
get this Flipstik
really dirty, here.
So we're gonna get
a little hair going on there.
Greiner: Ew.
How about a little
sand action here?
Greiner: [ Groans ]
And we got to get
a little bit...
Mama! Mama!
...of spaghetti.
Not the spaghetti!
This...
This ain't sticking
to nothing, alright?
So, check this out.
Watch as we wipe away
all the dirt and grit
and sand from this Flipstik.
Nice and clean.
And so, who thinks
it's gonna stick?
I do.
[ Laughs ]
I have a lot
of believers here.
Cuban: Hey!
Yay! Whoo?hoo!
And that, in a nutshell,
is Flipstik.
Any questions?
Do you have a patent?
A design patent?
So, I do have a patent.
In fact, let me just tell you
a little bit about my story.
Yeah.
So, it all started
when I was going to college
and I had
a full?tuition scholarship.
I went to Howard University
in Washington, D. C.
Nice.
I went there,
and I lost my scholarship
in the first year.
Greiner: Why?
Why?
It was a little bit
of partying.
It was a little bit
of depression, to be honest.
Aww.     Aww.
It was
the hardest phone call
I ever had to make
to my parents
because they sacrificed
everything
to get me to this point,
and I felt like I threw it away,
to be honest.
And I told myself,
"I got to prove to my parents,
'Hey, you did not waste
all of your savings,
your life energy on me.'"
So I got to work.
I ended up starting
in the cellphone industry
at a major retailer ??
Sprint ??
and I was one of the
top salespeople there.
I was making $30,000 a year.
Then I got recruited
to come work for Verizon
on their business side,
and next thing I know,
I'm making $60,000,
$70,000, $80,000 a year.
By the time my friends
graduated, I was making more
than any of them were making
coming out of college.
But not only that,
I was the number 1 rep
at a Fortune 500 company,
and eventually,
I ended up at one of the biggest
financial tech companies
in the world ?? Square.
But I'm meeting
all these entrepreneurs,,
and I'm talking to them.
I'm helping with their business.
I'm helping with marketing.
And it's just like, "Man,
if these guys can do it,
like, I got to do this.
Like, I got to quit."
My mom was not happy,
but this time, I was like,
"I have to go out on my own."
So, it's 3:00 A. M.
My uncle calls me.
My uncle's an engineer at NASA,
and he's telling me about
this project he's working on
called the Space Launch System.
And he ends up just talking
about how he's working through
some stuff, and he's gonna
use this adhesive.
Wait, your uncle called you
at 3:00 A. M.?
My uncle always calls
at 3:00 A. M.
because that's
the time he's up.
[ Laughter ]
He calls me 3:00 A. M.,
we're talking, and I'm like,
"Man, this adhesive
sounds interesting.
You know what? This could work
on a cellphone."
So I started doing research.
I get on YouTube.
I teach myself
to write a patent,
I teach myself
to write a trademark,
and I launch
my Kickstarter campaign.
And that's how
I got here today.
This film is not
proprietary, right?
That's correct.
I can buy
rolls of this myself.
That's correct.
So, the difference
is the design.
So we actually have filed
for a utility patent,
and it's for having
a double?sided adhesive
on the phone
and the flap cover.
What does it cost to make,
and what do you sell them for?
On average, it costs us
58 cents to make.
We sell these for $15.
Whoa.
However, often,
we sell them in bundles,
so it's one for $15,
two for $25, or three for $30.
Those are some margins
right there.
You got to be
killing it.
What are your
total sales to date?
Our total sales to date is
$115,000 in about 2 1/2 years.
Akeem, something's not
adding up. Your sales suck.
$115,000 over two years.
You've been
the number 1 salesperson
everywhere you've gone.
You know 115K is awful.
Right? For real.
60% of our business
is retail,
and I don't mean
online retail.
I mean brick?and?mortar
retail business.
Where?
So, I operate
a network of kiosks,
and we do
a number of events.
Retail was
completely eliminated.
You recognize the big miss here
is you're not selling direct.
'Cause your margins
are crazy.
Yes. Absolutely.
I'm gonna put an offer
out there, okay?
'Cause I think this is
absolutely fantastic.
No, you need to tell me
about competition...
Wait, wait. Let me just ??
You don't need Lori
for any of this.
Yes, he does. He needs me
way more than you.
I really want to tell Lori
about competition, 'cause
this is actually huge.
Listen, you got to
stop selling sometimes
to let the offers start
coming in, right?
Competition.
Look, I like the deal.
Valuation's not crazy.
I'll give you $100,000
for 20% ??
exactly what you want.
You don't like it?
if I might, Akeem.
You know, you've got such
a magnetic personality...
Thank you.
...and you are
a superstar salesman.
But I don't think
you're gonna succeed
unless you get yourself
a working partner.
I'm surprised you're getting
an offer from Kevin, honestly.
I don't think you're gonna make
a hit run on this at all,
so I'm out, sadly.
Thank you, Barbara.
John: So, here's where
I'm at, Akeem.
I have a similar company.
It doesn't make the same claims
you have, but, you know,
it's called LoveHandle,
and it stops you from
dropping the phone
as well as, you know ??
it can stand up as well.
I think they will be
somewhat of a competitor,
so I'm out.
I understand.
Thank you, Daymond, truly.
Akeem, how much
did you sell last month?
So, yeah, so, last month,
it was pretty low.
I mean, we're looking
at $1,500.
$1,500.
Yeah.
That's it?
I tell you something ??
I know what you need.
The name of the game
with this product ??
everything about it
is the visual,
and I've spent 20 years creating
over thousands of videos
that tell you
within 10 seconds
what a product is
and why you should buy it.
And I actually
really like ??
O'Leary: Akeem, I'm gonna
make it easy for you.
I'm gonna make
it easy for you.
I made you an offer ??
exactly what you wanted ??
before you told me that
you only sold $1,500,
so, clearly, nothing's
working digitally for you.
I'm not saying
Lori can't do it,
but I'm gonna make it easy.
When I make an offer
on "Shark Tank,"
I am the only
Mr. Wonderful,
and it's exactly
what you wanted.
You should have taken it.
Now you only have one Shark.
I'm out.
Akeem had one offer
on the table from Kevin
offering him exactly
what he came in seeking,
but his hesitation and new
information about his low sales
for his phone accessory,
Flipstik,
has caused Kevin to drop out.
I'm gonna make it easy.
I'm out.
Greiner: Akeem,
I'm a product person,
and I've sold over
1,000 successful products.
So here's my offer.
I'm gonna give you
the $100,000,
but I want 25%.
Lori, you understand
you're giving him a
valuation of $400,000.
He did $1,500
in sales last month.
That's primarily
due to COVID, to be fair.
Greiner: Wait, wait.
Here's the thing.
Two of our revenue
channels were cut.
Sometimes, when an entrepreneur
comes in here,
I'm just asking you
if you're aware.
I know what I can do.
