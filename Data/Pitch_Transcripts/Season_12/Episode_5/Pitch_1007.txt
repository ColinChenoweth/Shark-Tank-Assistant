Hey, Sharks.
My name is Sarah Apgar.
I'm from Baltimore, Maryland,
and I'm the founder and CEO
of FitFighter.
I'm seeking $250,000
for 15% equity in the company.
I'm an Iraq War veteran,
women's rugby all?American
from Princeton...
Wow.
...volunteer firefighter,
spouse of a West Point grad
and fellow Army vet,
and mom
of two gorgeous little girls.
And I invite you to train
like a hero,
like our nation's bravest,
with the most versatile
and durable fitness product
on the market ??
the FitFighter Steelhose.
Made in the USA
from real fire hose,
recycled steel shot,
and brass grommets,
the Steelhose is both a free
weight and a resistance tool,
with countless grips
on the hose itself ??
under, over, mixed grip,
and single arm,
and eight ways to layer
on the body ??
at the neck, chest,
elbow, shoulder,
side, hip, back, and ankle.
Wow.
[ Laughing ] I know.
The Steelhose system
is a complete, full?body,
strength, power,
and conditioning program.
We can work basic strength
for your everyday mission,
hauling gear and kids,
train for rotational sports,
and, finally, grip strength,
for climbing,
your golf swing, Robert,
or the mayonnaise jar.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
All that
without switching our tool.
And safe for our floors,
toddlers,
and toes.
Wow.
Sharks, with your help,
this product and training system
will bring the strength
and spirit of public service
to households, training centers,
and athletic fields nationwide
and turn every American watching
into the next fit fighter.
Wow!
Yeah!
Fabulous!
That was amazing!
So the question is,
are you ready, too?
Because I need a team,
so it's your turn.
If you'll stand up on your feet
and join me, Sharks.
Awesome.
So you each have a Steelhose
set in front of you.
I recommend my favorite hose, is
the one I worked with, the 15.
The 15.
Mark's just bragging.
What are we to do with it?
Oh, look at you, Mark!
Oh!
I can't do it over my head,
but I'll try anything else.
Is it okay for me to do
the little one?
Mark's doing 35.
Of course, yes.
Why did I know
that was gonna happen?
So what I want you to do is just
stand strong and tall for me,
and I want you
to lift that above your head.
It's gonna feel a
little different than
weights you're used to.
Put your arm
out to the side.
It does feel different.
All I want you to do is come
down to your shoulder and squat.
As you do that, press everything
back up, okay?
Optional ?? You can come down,
up, and over your head...
Oh!
...and get a sense for how soft
and malleable that is.
Oh hoh!
Excellent.
Let's bring it out front.
So you're going
to come side to side, okay?
That one's going to be hard
with the 35, okay?
And then final move, optional,
underhand, and you're going
to just give it a flip.
There you go.
Awesome job, Sharks.
Your first Steelhose moves ever.
Thank you so much.
Love to talk some more.
Oh! Geez!
I broke the table!
Did you really?
I did.
Lubetzky: Sarah...
Greiner: Oh, Robert.
Why is the experience
so positive?
Because it does feel much more
enjoyable than the weights.
Why is that?
Yeah.
That was so hard!
As I mentioned,
it's made from real fire hose,
and the original intent
was to mimic a fire hose
charged with water.
Oh.
When I joined
my volunteer fire department,
I noticed there was a gap
between the fitness training
in the gym
and what really happened
out there on the fire ground.
The obvious place to start
was how to mimic charged hose
without pulling hose
off the trucks,
charging it on
the hydrant with water.
Once we had prototyped this
in the firehouse,
I then went to
the FDNY Training Academy,
the premier institution
for training in the world
for firefighters,
and I walked into
the fitness director's office.
I said, "I've got something
special for you to see,"
and there was a moment of magic.
He immediately agreed,
and the FDNY was my first
major client
on our fire service side.
Good for you.
Good for you.
I want to understand
two things.
One, what did you do
in the military?
And number two, why did you join
to be a volunteer firefighter?
When I was looking at college,
the ROTC scholarship
was an option
to pay tuition to Princeton.
And so I left college and went
straight into the military
as a second lieutenant
and, after nine months
of training,
was on a charter aircraft
to Mosul
to support the
101st Airborne Division's
reconstruction of northern Iraq.
So I was
a 23?year?old platoon leader,
and my youngest soldier ??
I lost my youngest soldier
under my command.
He was 19 at the time.
And I remember that night,
huddling my platoon up
around me
and kneeling down
in the center,
and I just thought,
"This is the moment.
This is one of the most
important moments of my life,"
that leadership moment
to get us through.
So when I left the service,
I really ??
there was something
really powerful about
that community
and camaraderie that I missed.
And I vowed that
I would always work to honor
the memory
of that soldier that I lost.
And so I did my MBA,
and I was also pregnant
with my first baby girl.
And I was feeling, like,
this desire
to have the camaraderie back.
I thought that joining the local
volunteer fire department
would be a great way to just
keep that thread of public
service in my life.
Where did you find time
to spend two years doing an MBA?
So I did my MBA at Tuck School
of Business at Dartmouth.
You are
such an underachiever.
[ Laughs ]
You do women proud.
How much have you raised?
I launched the company
with $210,000
in friends?and?family funding.
Okay.
And that's 50K of my own money.
Also, importantly, in terms of
the scalability of our business,
I launched
a production partnership
with Sorinex exercise equipment
in May.
Sorinex is one of the largest
and most well respected
exercise?equipment manufacturers
in the country
and has a contract
for the United States Army
to provide the equipment
for the new
Army Combat Fitness Test.
We have the perfect tool
to train soldiers,
so I intend to generate the
enterprise value in this company
by selling institutionally
to the military,
to the fire service.
Let's get into the business
about what your
distribution strategy is.
We had $45,000 in sales,
proving the concept
in the B2B market.
Cuban:
Who did you sell that to?
O'Leary: Last year?
Last year. Trainers, coaches,
and small boutique gyms.
Okay,
so you're talking about
a variety
of different markets there.
So your $45,000
was for what period?
That was from July through
the end of 2019.
That's all your sales, all?in.
$45,000.
That was all the sales, all?in.
Correct.
Okay,
so here we are in 2020.
So here we are,
January 1st.
I was lining up
the Sorinex partnership
so that we could be ready
to scale to the future.
And during this pandemic,
that B2B market was effectively
shut down completely.
Right.
We decided, well,
what looks to be the way
that we can scale
the company forward
is to pivot and to build
a direct?to?consumer brand.
What are your sales
since you made that pivot?
We immediately
in April and May timeframe
had $40,000 in sales.
Wow.
In ??
So in just those 10 weeks.
That's great.
How did you get
those customers?
What were you doing? Videos?
Did you spend digitally?
Did you start trying
different ads on Facebook?
We did. And when we did that,
we launched an iOS app
that has
a 150?plus movement library
that's developed
by my training partners,
who are the best
in the business.
We launched also a live online
training platform program.
Do you charge for the app?
So I'm following you.
I'm watching you.
I'm in my home.
I'm watching my video,
and it's you doing it with me.
Yes.
And what do I pay for that?
Right, so the app model is that
it's a free download.
That's free.
Lubetzky: So if
I'm understanding correctly,
the app is designed
to create demand,
and then you want people
to download it for free
so that they can
order these from you.
Right, and then we do have
a $19?a?month option
where you can also
then have ??
And how many subscribers
do you have for that?
...complete workouts.
We have 302.
So let's walk through,
'cause there's a lot
of bouncing around here.
Yes.
Right?
Sorry, I'm trying to kind of
pull it together here.
With COVID, right,
everybody's reacting
and trying to be agile,
so I get that.
Yeah.
But, Sarah,
you're all over the map,
and you're not helping yourself
with that.
Okay, you're drowning
in opportunity.
It's hard to be in a business
and do <i>one</i> thing well.
It's harder to be
in a business
and try to do
multiple things.
You know, one minute, you say
you want to sell to firefighters
and the Department of Defense.
The next minute, you have,
you know, live online
and you're building
your community.
The next second, you want
to work through your trainers,
and everybody's
working this together,
and you want to have
direct?to?consumer.
You can't take on
15 battles
and expect to succeed
in any of them.
Hopefully, you'll get a deal,
because you need help.
but Mark is worried
about Sarah's lack of focus
in her fitness?accessory company
FitFighter.
Cuban: Sarah,
you're all over the map.
You can't take on
15 battles
and expect
to succeed in any of them.
Mm?hmm.
Hopefully, you'll get a deal,
because you need help.
Just going on the path
that you're going,
you are going to fail
at this, right?
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay.
I'm in this space
with PRx.
We had to go through
the same pivot.
Yeah.
The digital pivot works.
Yeah.
And our sales are up 400%
selling direct to consumers.
But for me,
I'm not gonna invest
'cause I'd be competing with
myself in customer acquisition.
I'm out.
Look, you're one of the most
impressive human beings
we've ever seen,
but the business side of it
falls apart a little.
When you came out,
I said, "Oh, my God.
She is killing it!
She's selling subscription
classes online."
Mm?hmm.
"And this is nothing.
I'm paying
for a subscription."
Mm?hmm. Mm?hmm.
But yet your model
seems to be,
"Let's sell a lot of these
and use the subscription
to somehow promote it."
What I've learned
in this industry
is you got to move
really fast.
Mm?hmm.
And if you haven't
moved online already,
I don't know if you can make
that transition at this point.
I'm out.
?Sarah, listen to me.
?Okay.
Everything they said
is actually true.
You're ridiculously impressive.
You need to focus more.
But I think you have
incredible potential.
I think your presentation
can become something
that inspires people.
I think you can do something
really, really big,
and it's gonna take a lot
of work and a lot of focus.
I'm willing to take
that journey with you
because I'm just so inspired
by your story.
So I'm gonna give you
one of two offers,
depending on whether Lori
wants to join me.
Okay.
If she wants to join me,
you get two Sharks,
30% for $250,000.
What would you offer her
if it was just you alone?
25% myself.
Sarah, I'm not gonna join Daniel
on the offer.
I feel
that he's a partner
that can bring a lot
to the table for you.
I think it's a better deal
for you.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay, so your offer is...
So, Sarah, you have
an offer over here.
Okay.
...25%...
Focus here.
...for $250,000.
I think that's
a generous number,
given where you're at
in terms of dollars,
but it's knowing where
you're gonna head.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm super grateful.
So I'd like to counter
at $250,000 for 20%,
and it's a done deal,
and let's go do it.
I respect the toughness
of your counter.
But the answer is no...
Yes.
...because I'm already
stretching myself to 25%.
That already factors in...
Stick to your guns, Sarah.
...the leadership potential.
Greiner: He'll be
a great partner.
Co?captain Daniel Lubetzky!
Whoo!
You got it.
Hoo! Hah! Hoh!
Awesome!
[ Grunting ]
[ Laughter ]
Thanks, Daniel.
I'm so psyched.
Congratulations.
I mean, wow.
And great feedback.
Lubetzky: Congratulations.
I can't wait to work with you.
Me too.
Let me just...
Cuban: Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
With a partner like Daniel,
we can build a strategy
for the future.
As a woman?owned,
veteran?owned company,
young girls and women
will look up to us,
and they will know
what's possible.
Narrator: In Season 11,
Jenny Goldfarb
made a deal with Mark Cuban
for her vegan version
of deli meat, Unreal Deli.
Mark Cuban,
you got yourself a deal.
That's what's up!
Narrator:
Let's see how she's doing now.
Goldfarb: I came onto the show
with only $10,000 in revenues.
In just over half a year,
we reached over $300,000
in sales.
Unreal Deli became
a permanent fixture on the menu
in 175 deli
and restaurant locations,
from Whole Foods Grab and Go
to Veggie Grill
to Mendocino Farms
Sandwich Market.
But when COVID?19 reached
our shores, everything changed.
A couple weeks before
the whole nation shut down,
my dad tested positive
for COVID?19
