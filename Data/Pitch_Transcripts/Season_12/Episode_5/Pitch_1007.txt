Hey, Sharks.
My name is Sarah Apgar.
Lubetzky: Sarah...
Greiner: Oh, Robert.
Why is the experience
so positive?
Because it does feel much more
enjoyable than the weights.
Why is that?
Yeah.
That was so hard!
As I mentioned,
it's made from real fire hose,
But, Sarah,
you're all over the map,
but Mark is worried
about Sarah's lack of focus
in her fitness?accessory company
FitFighter.
Cuban: Sarah,
you're all over the map.
You can't take on
15 battles
?Sarah, listen to me.
?Okay.
Everything they said
is actually true.
You're ridiculously impressive.
You need to focus more.
But I think you have
incredible potential.
I think your presentation
can become something
that inspires people.
I think you can do something
really, really big,
Sarah, I'm not gonna join Daniel
on the offer.
I feel
that he's a partner
that can bring a lot
to the table for you.
I think it's a better deal
for you.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Okay, so your offer is...
So, Sarah, you have
an offer over here.
Okay.
...25%...
Focus here.
...for $250,000.
I think that's
a generous number,
given where you're at
in terms of dollars,
but it's knowing where
you're gonna head.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm super grateful.
So I'd like to counter
at $250,000 for 20%,
That already factors in...
Stick to your guns, Sarah.
...the leadership potential.
Greiner: He'll be
a great partner.
Co?captain Daniel Lubetzky!
Whoo!
You got it.
Hoo! Hah! Hoh!
Awesome!

Thanks, Daniel.
I'm so psyched.
Congratulations.
