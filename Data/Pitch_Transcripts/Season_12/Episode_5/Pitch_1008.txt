O'Leary: I get it, Ken.

Keep it going. Keep on going.
?Let me finish.
?But hang on.
You've got a lot of energy,

?Kevin, let me tell you.
?Hear me ??
I just want to ask
a question.
We got best product ?? I got
best product of the year.
Ken, you came to the Shark Tank
for an investment.
You won't let
the investors talk!
I've traveled to every
trade show in the world.
I've gone to Consumer
Electronics for 30 years.
Okay, Ken, Ken, Ken.
I'm gonna press that button
on your head in a second.
I have to ask a question, okay?
Please just listen.
Ken, how much
have you sold of this?
We have sold
1,240 pieces.

?How much do they sell for?
So how many dollars

Greiner:
Here's the problem for me.
I have never created
or been a part of
or invested in any products
that make claims that have to do
with physical things,
like you'll lose weight,
you'll look better.
I have to feel that
I can show efficacy 100%,
so I steer clear.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I accept the fact
that you're a great salesman
'cause you were
telling me that.
But I can't justify
the great salesman
with the absolutely horrific
presentation you did today.
Good for you, Ken.
Good for you.
It's a major home run for us.
Ken.
Yes?
Silence for one moment.
Yes.
Ken: The Sharks
are gonna regret
that they did not
invest in LIFTiD.
It's a multibillion?dollar
category,
I was born in Ethiopia.
I grew up in Kenya.
