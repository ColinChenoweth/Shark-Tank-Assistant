and was taken to intensive care.
He spent 28 days
on a ventilator,
and doctors told my family
that we should start planning
for the worst.
When we had lost
nearly all hope,
my dad received
a plasma donation,
which started
to turn things around,
and two months later,
he finally came home
and began his slow road
to recovery, a complete miracle.
Throughout my journey,
Mark has offered unwavering
support and guidance.
Restaurants were hit hard,
and our sales were flatlining.
Mark was the one who realized
we needed to pivot into retail.
We went deep into research
and development
to create our second product,
Unreal Turk'y.
And now we can proudly state
300 grocery stores out the gate,
with at least another 300
to come.
Pivoting to retail
saved the business
and made this whole
nightmare story
into something really wonderful.
Grandpa's going home.
[ Squeals ]
What this has all meant for me
is that we have to use each day
we're here to make our mark,
help save animals,
help the Earth,
and help folks eat much better,
healthier, delicious food
to really take advantage
of these days,
'cause we don't know
if tomorrow will even come.
I'm Allyson.
And I'm Ken.
And we're the brains
behind one of the hottest
devices in the world.
We're looking for
a $200,000 investment
for 10% of our company.
Sharks, nowadays, everyone
is searching for ways
to increase productivity,
focus, and performance.
To get a boost,
students, professionals,
video gamers, and athletes
are all consuming too much
caffeine and sugary snacks.
These chemical stimulants
raise the heart rate
and travel
through the entire body,
but only a small bit
of the stimulant
makes its way
to the brain.
What if there were a smarter way
to get a similar boost of energy
using a new
emerging technology?
Well, now there is.
Introducing LIFTiD
Neurostimulation.
LIFTiD utilizes
a process called
transcranial direct current
stimulation, or tDCS.
Our device uses
a mild electric current
that passes through
two electrodes
placed on the upper
forehead area
known as the frontal lobe,
a part of the brain that
when stimulated
has been shown to increase
focus, attention, and memory.
A stimulation session lasts
20 minutes once a day
while a user
is performing a task,
like studying for an exam,
playing a video game,
or reading a book.
Designed by a world?class
neuroscience team,
LIFTiD is easy to use,
lightweight, stylish,
and well?positioned to become
the coffee of the future.
Sharks, who's ready
to get productive...
Get focused...
Both: And get LIFTiD?
Sharks,
we would love to do
a LIFTiD stimulation session
with you.
And it's safe? We're not
gonna get electrocuted?
It is so safe.
Okay, so what you have
in front of you
is a kit that has everything
that you will need
to do a LIFTiD
stimulation session.
So if you open the kit and
you'll pull out the device...
This device?
Both: That's the device.
And you turn it over,
you'll see there are
two black electrodes.
And what we're gonna do
is, there are sponges...
Right in front of you
that are in a saline solution.
...right in front of you.
Put them inside your electrodes,
and then you're ready to go.
I'm gonna put this
on Allyson's head.
Okay?
And then what do we do?
Okay, so then you're gonna
put it on your forehead.
This is freaking me out.
You have your sponges
in there.
[ Buzzing ]
Alright, I'm gonna
hold mine, okay?
It's alive!
Ken: Everybody reach
for the button.
Press that down for two seconds.
Hold it for two seconds.
And you'll hear a beep.
?Okay.
?Does everybody hear a beep?
?Yeah.
?Ooh!
?I'm beeping.
?Now it's ramping up.
?I am a robot.
?It's ramping up.
?Ooh!
?Oh!
?And it's 30 seconds.
?It's ramping up.
?Whoa!
?I can feel it.
?It's ramping up for 30 seconds.
Whoo!
?I feel like I'm being shocked.
?Get used to it.
That's what tDCS ??
It's a little prickly
and tingling.
Herjavec: Yes.
I feel it in
my upper teeth, too.
It stings a little bit.
I don't feel that same stimulus,
like, with a coffee or anything.
Like, is it immediate?
So this device, you are supposed
to be doing something
to get your brain working
and focusing on something,
and that's how you improve
your focus.
Cuban: Well, I'm gonna
ramp it down, guys.
How do you know something
won't go wrong?
Well, first of all...
That's a great question.
...tDCS is backed by
5,000 published studies.
They are using it
for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's...
Any evidence it works?
...for epilepsy.
What is it doing
for those things, specifically?
The brain
has billions of neurons,
and in those billions
of neurons, most are dormant.
So when you're doing
a stimulation session
and you're doing, like,
for example, a spreadsheet,
what's happening
is called neuroplasticity.
That means
the more you do that,
the more those neurons
are likely to fire
the next time you do it.
Cuban: Wait. All Sharks.
This is a notice
to all Sharks.
Warnings for
LIFTiD Neurostimulation.
Read along with me, Sharks.
"Do not use if you have
any electronic
implanted medical device,
a metal plate in the brain,
or had a pacemaker
or defibrillator.
Do not use if you have epilepsy,
seizures, brain lesions,
or severe heart disease.
Do not use if you have
sensitive skin or a rash,
broken skin, or open wounds,
such as sores, cuts,
or pimples."
Right.
"Do not use while driving,
drinking, operating machinery,
or any situation
where you may be impaired."
Herjavec: "Has no medical
benefit and is not...
Cuban and Herjavec:
...intended to prevent
or treat
any medical condition."
We're not making
any medical claims.
Cuban: I'm not saying
you're making claims.
Right.
?But the point is...
?Mark, this is for cognitive ??
...if it has no medical benefit,
what's the point?
Mark, you know
neuroscience.
This is for
cognitive benefit.
It's for focus,
attention, and memory.
Greiner: You're very,
very passionate about this.
?Yes.
?It's clear.
Why are you so passionate
about this,
and why did you decide
to do this product?
I've always had an eye
for product.
I was National Salesman
of the Year for Hasbro
at 23 years old.
Also,
when I was in college,
I sold solar hats
on the streets of D. C.
I introduced General Mills to
the two?piece spoon in the lid
that was on Colombo yogurt,
if you remember that.
O'Leary: I get it, Ken.
I get it. You're a product guy.
Keep it going. Keep on going.
?Let me finish.
?But hang on.
You've got a lot of energy,
but I want to go back.
?Kevin, let me tell you.
?Hear me ??
I just want to ask
a question.
We got best product ?? I got
best product of the year.
Ken, you came to the Shark Tank
for an investment.
You won't let
the investors talk!
I've traveled to every
trade show in the world.
I've gone to Consumer
Electronics for 30 years.
Okay, Ken, Ken, Ken.
I'm gonna press that button
on your head in a second.
I have to ask a question, okay?
Please just listen.
Ken, how much
have you sold of this?
We have sold
1,240 pieces.
Since October 1st.
We are here ??
?How?
?How much do they sell for?
They're landed for $22
with duty all?in,
and they sell for $149.
So how many dollars
is that, Ken?
$126,000.
Greiner:
Here's the problem for me.
I have never created
or been a part of
or invested in any products
that make claims that have to do
with physical things,
like you'll lose weight,
you'll look better.
I have to feel that
I can show efficacy 100%,
so I steer clear.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I accept the fact
that you're a great salesman
'cause you were
telling me that.
But I can't justify
the great salesman
with the absolutely horrific
presentation you did today.
But, Robert ??
You did nothing
but come out here and talk.
Talk.
Right.
And you were like
a machine gun.
Your job is to get me
to share that passion,
and the way to <i>not</i> do that
is just to talk over everybody.
It's difficult. Yes.
The nicest thing I can say
to you today is...
I'm out.
Okay.
I do not doubt
for one second
that you believe
every single thing you shared.
And it may well be true.
I cannot connect to stuff,
and I cannot invest in stuff
that I cannot connect to.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
And I appreciate that.
This is a dream to be here.
We did this,
and we're here today,
and this is a major ??
Good for you, Ken.
Good for you.
It's a major home run for us.
Ken.
Yes?
Silence for one moment.
Yes.
I have a headache,
and I don't know
whether it's you
or my session on the LIFTiD.
I believe you're
a great sales guy.
I really do.
And you're very passionate.
That's clear.
But you're now in the lexicon
of the craziest pitches
ever on "Shark Tank."
I can't join you guys.
But, Kevin, I ??
I'm out.
Guys, look, you tried to sell
science without using science.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
?Good luck.
?We appreciate it.
?Thank you.
?Yep.
?Bye?bye.
?Bye.
Ken: The Sharks
are gonna regret
that they did not
invest in LIFTiD.
It's a multibillion?dollar
category,
and it helps people.
And we've got that device,
and we can't wait to keep
growing this particular brand.
LIFTiD is here to stay.
I was born in Ethiopia.
I grew up in Kenya.
My father was in agriculture
and always in outdoors,
used to grow up going on safari.
Came to the US.
I went on to study
environmental economics
and also have an MBA in finance.
So I was able to put
all these things together
and come out with a product
that would promote my interests
and also address
some of the environmental
and social concerns.
When you came out,
I saw honey wine.
I thought, "Aw,
kind of a shtick."
Yeah.
And then I tried it,
and I loved it.
Now I'll buy it.
I'm going to guess
the problem with your product
is people aren't going to buy it
until they try it.
Exactly.
And that's why we got ??
Well, I think
there's a bigger problem.
I think it's price,
'cause $39.95,
that's not a price
you would sample new wine at.
Here's a fact.
97% of wine sold in America
is sold
for under $14 a bottle.
97%.
What's your cost
for this bottle?
That's $5.93.
So why are you selling it
so expensively when you can get
to that $14.99
price point?
Because, I mean,
it's just classical strategy.
Either you're small volume,
high margin or ??
So how's that strategy
working for you?
It's a long?term play because
this is gonna grow over time.
Greiner: Well, it's something
you could change.
You've got
to have an introductory.
You've got to have a price point
where people can ??
No, but, Mark, I think you're
going down the wrong road.
I don't think it matters
what the price is.
And yes,
97% are sold to that.
Greiner: I do.
I think it matters a lot.
A Sauvignon blanc costs $35.
The problem here
is people need to try it.
Well, that's my point,
Robert.
Mark is right on the money.
It's that sweet spot
of being under $15, right?
?Yeah.
?And if it's not what you like,
you haven't
really lost that much.
Exactly.
I like all wines,
and I appreciate the mastery
of what you've made here,
but two big issues here.
One is getting trial.
I think Robert brought that up.
Breaching the $14
price point is very hard.
Very hard.
?Well, I mean,
lowering the price
is not going to
get people to buy more.
We've experimented with that,
and it's not sustainable.
I'm not sure about that.
That's 97% of the market.
Let's focus on the issue
of valuation.
You have to ship
50,000 cases to break even.
How many cases
are you shipping?
Yeah.
Well, I was doing about
400 or 500 cases a year.
400 or 500?
Yeah.
You know what?
I'm a product person.
I've done wine deals.
I'm not Kevin,
but I'm not snobby
about wines, frankly.
Tastes good.
Looks good.
First white wine I've liked,
and I like all four.
It's like drinking a soda.
It's kind of like
a dream come true.
?Thank you.
?I loved it.
And you're saving the bees.
So to me, I feel like
it doesn't really matter
the things that
you were just saying,
because at the end
of the day ??
What are you talking about?
This is a hobby.
It's not a hobby!
And let me tell you
something.
I have talked
with my fellow Sharks.
Here's the bottom line.
We're going to
make you an offer.
Herjavec: Yes.
And the offer is this.
you're going to get
four Sharks ??
Mark, Daniel,
myself, and Robert.
Okay.
So we're going to
make you an offer.
$750,000,
but we want 40%,
10% for each Shark.
Cuban: For each Shark.
We will help you.
You need the trajectory
of the publicity,
the sales, the recognizability.
Do you know how rare it is
that you get four Sharks?
I don't want Kevin to be left
out, and I want him ??
Kevin does not
want to be in.
We are very comfortable
without Kevin.
I can't do it. I have
very complex contracts.
