My name is Ayele Solomon,
and I'm from Sonoma, California.
My company
is the Honey Wine Company,
producers of Bee d'Vine.
I'm seeking $750,000
for 20% of my business.

sustainable, naturally

It's called honey wine.
Hm.
Ethiopia, where I was born,

Every sip of Bee d'Vine
helps save our endangered bees
Solomon:

Solomon: Yeah, I know ??
Kevin O'Leary Wines.

yes to the 40%.

This is non?negotiable, Ayele.
This is a yes or no.

I would come out there
