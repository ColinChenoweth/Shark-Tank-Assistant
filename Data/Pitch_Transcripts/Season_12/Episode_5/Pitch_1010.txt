My name is Ayele Solomon,
and I'm from Sonoma, California.
My company
is the Honey Wine Company,
producers of Bee d'Vine.
I'm seeking $750,000
for 20% of my business.
For centuries,
people from all over
have been enjoying the world's
oldest alcoholic beverage.
It's made from a simple,
sustainable, naturally
sweet ingredient ?? honey.
That's right.
It's called honey wine.
Hm.
Ethiopia, where I was born,
is the largest honey wine?
drinking country in the world.
Commonly referred to as mead,
I have perfected the formula.
Every sip of Bee d'Vine
helps save our endangered bees
and promotes a permanent change
for thousands
of beekeeping households
and forests around the world.
Ultra smooth and fragrant,
Bee d'Vine is produced
in small batches from just
two ingredients ??
raw local honey
and pure spring water.
When you sip Bee d'Vine,
you'll experience the taste
of exotic floral nectars
dancing on your palate.
I love that.
Ooh!
I'm ready.
Yes.
Alright.
So we start from left to right.
Okay.
On the far left
is the Brut non?sparkling.
And I'll join you.
Okay, this is
a "Shark Tank" tradition.
Herjavec:
We have to do this.
All:
To the Chevaliers du Tastevin!
[ Cheering ]
[ Laughs ]
Solomon:
So that's the Brut.
Brut is remarkably dry
and complex,
and the oak aging gives it
a nice, mellow vanilla finish.
The next one is a sweet,
non?sparkling,
has mellow tropical fruit
flavors.
Cheers.
Chevaliers du Tastevin!
All: Chevaliers du Tastevin!
Wait, let's let
Daniel do one.
Okay, go ahead, Daniel.
Daniel.
To the Chevaliers du Tastevin!
[ Cheering ]
Now, I just want to
make a quick note
for those who don't know who
the Chevaliers du Tastevin is.
It's a secret wine club
of Burgundian drinkers.
It's not a secret anymore.
Very secret.
Not anymore, though.
This is so sweet!
I love it.
Oh, it's so sweet.
I love it.
There's something
for everybody.
That's the beauty of it.
Herjavec: Almost like
tasting pure honey.
Greiner:
It's a dessert wine.
We'll finish it off
with the sparkling sweet.
[ Smacks lips ]
Ooh, I like this one.
?Mm!
?I like this one.
Cuban: Ooh!
It's really good!
I like every single
one of these.
Oh, wow. Thank you.
How much does it
cost at retail?
The non?sparkling
is $39 retail.
The sparkling is $49.
And how many have you sold?
In six years now,
just over $400,000.
Over six years?
Dollars' worth,
six years, yes.
Whew. How many did
you sell last year?
In the last 12 months,
we've sold $115,000.
?Why so little?
?Yeah.
Well, it's, one,
by myself doing this.
I had a full?time job for
the first five of the six years.
There wasn't
a huge marketing budget.
We've put in about
$600,000
between myself, family,
and some friends.
Wow.
Yeah.
Tell us your story.
Why are you doing this?
Solomon: Yeah, I know ??
Kevin O'Leary Wines.
Look, there's two things.
One, this is non?negotiable,
'cause this is the only way
we're going to get four in.
So you're going to have to say
yes to the 40%.
There's no negotiating.
And two, the second goal is,
other than
the environmental issues,
we're going to destroy
O'Leary Wines.
[ Laughter ]
We're just going to
blow them away.
And whatever he's going to sell,
we're going to sell four times
as much
'cause there are four Sharks.
I don't want to put any business
out of business.
You're gonna get
an education.
I just want you to do great.
Here's my counter.
?No. No.
?Listen, listen, listen.
?No, no, no.
?Nope.
Please understand,
your numbers make no sense.
You asked for $750,000.
We're doing this because we're
believing in the long term
and because of what Lori
explained.
And because the value
of four of us working together.
This is non?negotiable, Ayele.
This is a yes or no.
If I were you, I wouldn't
even think about that.
You're, like...
Congrats, Ayele.
Alright. Thank you.
Congrats.
Unbelievable. I made a deal
with all four Sharks.
This is huge.
I mean, I never thought
I would come out there
and, without even
much negotiation,
all four Sharks just jumped
in the water.
