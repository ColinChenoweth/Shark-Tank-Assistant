Hi, Sharks.
My name is Manuel Rojas.
And I am Grace Rojas.
And we're here asking
for $100,000
for 15% of our
amazing company...
Both: Foam Party Hats!
Whoo!         Whoo!
[ Whistle blowing, laughter ]
Whoo!
This amazing idea started
more than 15 years ago
back in Venezuela
at my sister's wedding.
My beautiful, genius,
creative mother...
Thank you.
...decided to make something
fun, something different.
I want to create something
special for my guests,
so I bought some materials
and I start making my first
Foam Party Hats.
Fast?forward to 2017.
We founded Foam Party Hats
here in the U. S.
We have more than
600 models,
all of them handmade
in the U. S.,
and they're
100% customizable.
Sharks, who's ready to get crazy
with Foam Party Hats?
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
Strong.
[ Cheering ]
Okay, Sharks, wait a second.
Wait a second.
We're a party company,
and we want to celebrate
that this is the first time
I wear pants in a long time.
[ Laughter ]
So if you look
behind your seat,
you'll find a box with your own
custom Foam Party Hat.
?Oh.
?Oh! Whoa.
Okay, so let's start.
Ladies first.
Lori, the QVC queen.
It's cool.
It's a jewelry box!
Yeah, exactly.
So we know you made your first
millions selling jewelry boxes.
My gosh.
?Put it on!
?[ Laughs ]
Mark, can you guess?
Yeah, stamp collecting
when I was a kid.
Yes.
Greiner: Oh, my gosh.
Everybody knows
Mr. Wonderful.
Yeah, listen,
that's spectacular.
But not everybody knows
you're <i>Chef</i> Wonderful, right?
Greiner: Yeah, it is. So cute.
And your favorite place ??
Well, now they do.
Robert,
so I truly believe
you're the best?dressed Shark
all the time.
That's why we made
this creation.
Greiner: Aw!
Thank you.
Suit hat tailored just for you.
We heard that you're crazy
about nuts, Daniel.
"I love nuts" hat for you.
Only true nuts
can change the world.
Yeah, and you're right.
So, guys, please take the hat
and reach down inside,
and you'll find
a little switch.
So there you go.
Whoa!
Robert has it.
It gets even better!
I know!
O'Leary:
That is tremendous.
Okay,
you guys are ready.
Greiner:
I have a question.
Do you design all of these
and make all of them?
So she designs everything.
You know, we mentioned
that we have 600 hats.
It's because a lot of the
products that we have created,
because people reach out to us
and ask for custom hats.
So when I go online
to find foam party hats,
am I going to find you at
the top of that list?
Of course. And that's
what drives sales.
Just that keyword has been
what has bring all
the business to us.
They always get
big orders.
Average sale is $240.
Oh, wow.
How much is a hat?
So this one is $25.
This one is $40.
How much is this one?
That's expensive.
Manuel: That one is $35.
Lori's is $50.
How much does it cost you
to make a $45 hat?
Cost of product will
be around $2, $3.
And $7 would be
the employees.
It's cool that you're able
to customize, but most times,
you want to have one or two
or 10 items
that you can crank out
and just sell a huge amount.
Let me finish explaining
the business model.
So people, you know, weddings
is our biggest market,
like 80% of our sales
to weddings.
Weddings?
Grace: Weddings.
Weddings, yeah.
The wedding industry,
that I have many companies in,
that business has ground
to a halt since March 17th.
Yeah, is anybody
getting married anymore?
No.
So, yeah. So we have changed
our business model
while the pandemic hit.
Basically, our sales decreased
like 80%.
One week, I was sleeping
two, three hours
because I was
freaking out.
But one day, I woke up
and I was like,
I hate when people
just stay without
doing nothing
and crying about, like,
"Oh, my God, we're not going
to be able to make it."
Especially, you know,
people dying.
And we had no excuse
to just do nothing.
So I went to Amazon,
started investigating how to be
really proficient on Amazon.
So first month, in March,
we did like $800 worth,
but then I spent many hours
at night figuring out
how to do keyword SEO.
And what were your sales
on Amazon last month?
Last month?
$6,000.
Good for you.
When the wedding
business was big,
what were your sales
on a monthly basis?
Okay, so let me just tell
the overall sales.
[ Chuckles ]
So when we started 2017,
we did $25,000 in sales.
2018, we got $75,000
in sales.
And then last year,
we did $145,000 in sales.
This year, right now, we have
sold $8,000 more than last year,
which for me,
I think it's amazing.
?Yeah, it's great.
?Based on the pandemic, right?
Is anything automated
or automatable?
Not right now,
but that's why we're here.
We need the money
to scale up big?, big?time.
What did you do
to get people to you?
Nothing.
Greiner: No videos?
What did you do during
the pandemic?
Oh, the pandemic?
So I have a ??
Let me show
you something real ??
I was waiting for this.
Give me a second.
[ Chuckles ]
So one thing while
the pandemic hit
is that everything was ??
[ Laughter ]
Everything was
about social ??
That's a great idea.
Social distancing,
so I told my mom,
"Let's just make something
that is like a virus,
but let's make it fun so people
don't get offended by it."
How many of those
have you sold?
We have sold around
300 of these.
O'Leary: Look, companies that
service parties and weddings
get 80% of their sales
from 20% of their product line.
That's a business model
that works.
But you don't have
that model yet.
It's a great business
for you.
It's a family business.
You guys are terrific.
I feel bad about saying I'm out,
but I am.
No, before you
say anything ??
I just did.
Cuban:
Guys, let me step in.
Your biggest challenge here
is you don't know
what business you're in.
You think you're
in the foam hat business,
and you're trying to figure out
how to sell more foam hats.
You're in the fun business.
Correct. Exactly.
Right?
You figured out how to sell fun
when you did your virus hats.
You just want to keep on
creating ideas and using SEO
because you can control
your own destiny,
but you don't know
what business you're in yet.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Manuel, I might be
giving you an offer
based on how you answer
the following questions.
Do you own 100%
of the business?
80% and 20%.
?[ Speaking Spanish ]
?80% for mom?
?Yeah.
?Wait.
iY Chihuahua caramba!
Guys, is this
your full?time job?
No, I have a full?time job.
I'm a chemical engineer.
And are you willing to make this
your full?time job?
Of course.
That's why we're here.
Are you sure?
Because the only way
I'll give you an offer
is if you're fully in.
Yes, of course.
Ohh.
I don't know about that.
But you're not investing,
so ??
Yeah, but I'm just trying to
help my friend Manuel.
Herjavec: Let me just tell you
where I'm at.
Sorry, Daniel.
Just to clear things up.
There's two things
I really admire about you guys.
One is the hustle,
and the other one
is your ability
to just make no excuses.
It's a great business for you,
but as an investment,
it's not for me,
so I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
Appreciate it.
Listen, I love you guys.
I love your energy.
There's just a ton of work
to be done.
Like, I calculate
I'm going to be putting
another $200,000
in my team members' time
to just help you guys along.
I don't think you have figured
out how to mass?scale.
At Kind, we mastered Amazon.
We need to deploy
your creativity.
Together,
I think with some guidance,
I think
we will build a huge business.
The offer is $100,000 for 30%.
And it is not negotiable
because it's going
to be, on top of the $100,000,
a ridiculous amount of work.
It's not a bad offer.
Don't quit your job.
Huge mistake, Manuel.
Huh?
Huge mistake.
Manuel and Grace have an offer
on the table from Daniel ??
$100,000 for 30% of
their foam party hat company,
with a caveat that Manuel works
full time on the business.
But Mark strongly disagrees.
Huge mistake, Manuel.
Herjavec: Mark, you're out.
Huge mistake.
I love when these Sharks
have all these comments,
but they will back out.
Let me just tell you,
all the things he wants to do
are going to cost more
than $100,000.
Money talks.
Yeah,
what's happening here?
BS walks.
Thank you.
I'm just telling you,
I don't want to see
an entrepreneur put
in a bad spot.
Hey, listen,
then <i>you</i> write a check.
Mark Cuban forbids
you getting any money here.
Ask for more money.
Listen, what I think
you're missing
is marketing
expertise, right?
I want Daniel to have me
join him as a partner.
I'm really good
at marketing,
and I'm really good
at creating videos.
I'm dying to work with you,
Lori, but for this deal,
it's just gonna take
so much focus and attention.
I will help you guys
figure it out.
But I think I need to go
on this one alone.
?You're going alone?
?Yes.
He just threw you
under a bus.
Mark, you want to go
in with me?
[ Laughs ]
Just to mess with Daniel?
Go in with me.
Why don't we do
$100,000 for 25%?
Let's do this.
Whoo!
So the way to do this,
Manuel and Grace,
is you do what you did
with the virus hat.
That's where your creativity
comes shining through.
And you combine that with not
just <i>your</i> SEO abilities,
but <i>our</i> SEO abilities,
right?
Then you can keep your job.
What are you talking about?
You need him to
figure this stuff out
unless you're going
full time...
No, because I understand
how SEO works.
We can figure it out.
He wants to do this.
Oh, man. Loving this.
[ Laughter ]
Grace and Manuel,
you have two offers.
You got to get focused now.
Yeah.
You've got Mark,
who came back in
after barking at you
like a dog all day.
Herjavec: Woof!
[ Laughter ]
And then you've got Daniel,
who wants to put you full time.
Mark and Lori's offer does not
require you to quit your job.
Manuel,
this is the key question ??
what do you want to do
with your life?
And it's 5% less.
[ Conversing in Spanish ]
We love you, Daniel. Honestly,
what you're doing is amazing.
But having two Sharks
for 25% ??
Espere, espere.
Wait a second! Wait a second.
I will do it for 25%.
I ??
I want to say, at this point,
we're still facing a pandemic,
and I need stability
just in case something happens.
I have a vision.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I really appreciate it, but this
is a really good offer for us.
Mark and Lori,
thank you so much, guys.
Whoo!
We're going to crush this.
Man, oh, my God.
Thank you.
Now we'll do our money dance.
[ Vocalizing ]
Yeah!
[ Laughs ]
We need a Shark hat.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Thank you, guys.
Yes!
Whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Get ready, US.
Get ready, world.
Come on. Yes.
Foam Party Hat!
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Whoo!
You know what's the lesson?
Don't undermine Lori.
When she wants a deal, you need
to go with her or else.
No, don't <i>trust</i> Lori.
Me?!
I didn't do anything!
You are vicious.
I asked you to join me,
and you said no!
I respectfully said
I needed to do this one alone.
That's not throwing
under the bus.
That's okay.
But I don't have
to sit back and go, "Okay."
