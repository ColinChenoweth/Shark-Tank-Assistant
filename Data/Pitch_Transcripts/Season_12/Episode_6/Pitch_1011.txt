Blake Mycoskie, the founder of
revolutionary shoe company Toms,
returns to the Tank.
This show's not about getting
the very best deal.
It's about getting
the best partner.
We live in a time
when people are questioning
the quality of the air
they breathe.
Everything you're surrounded by
is either sugary or caffeinated.
Oron: I don't think
you can do anything
without doing some good,
as well.
Sounds expensive.
Ooh.
If Daymond drops out,
bad things could happen.
I'm gonna match Kevin's offer.
Wait, wait, wait.
Who do you like more?
I love all you guys.
It's now or never, Michael.
No. No. You can't do that.
Why would you want <i>one</i> Shark
when you can have two?
Let's go!
My company is...
Pan's.
Pan's Mushroom Jerky!
John: I was wondering
why it was so soft.
I love it even more!
This is great.
We have four delicious flavors.
Oh, my God.
Original, Zesty Thai,
Michael,
you making money yet?
We are.
Our margin's around 77%
across all channels
at the moment.
What will
the company make
if it hits its sales targets
this year?
In profit.
In profit.
So far this year,
we are netting $61,000.
So you're saying
there's a 10% profit margin?
Yes.
John: So, I'm gonna
just sum this all up.
You're offering 10%
for $300,000.
You would have to grow
the company significantly
for me to make at least twice
my money back, right?
Michael ?? Michael ??
Now, before you interrupt,
let me just say is,
this show's not about, like,
getting the very best deal.
It's about getting
the best partner,
Well, Michael ??
Michael, here.
Just real quick.
I've done this before.
This would be added
to the portfolio.
I'll do 300K for 20%
if you say yes now.
No. No. You can't do that.
[ Mycoskie laughs ]
It's now or never,
Michael.
Michael has two offers
on the table ??
for his mushroom jerky company,
Pan's.
Because Mark does that
all the time.
It's now or never, Michael.
So, Blake ?? Blake...
Why would you want <i>one</i> Shark
when you can have two?
Don't do that.
What are you gonna do?
We are passionate
about this.
Passionate about it.
Michael, I do it ??
I've done it all the time.
It's a decision how much equity
you want to part with.
Mycoskie: He used
the word "portfolio."
You're just gonna be one
of many people in his portfolio.
No, no,
the whole point is,
they're all
plant?based companies,
so we already are
in Whole Foods.
We already have Alyssa's.
We already have Snacklins.
You're not in Starbucks.
What would you like to do,
Michael?
Wait, don't force him on...
I am!
This is a very big decision ??
his whole business.
Don't force him.
'cause we're each
1 1/2 Sharks.
John: Be truthful, Michael.
Who do you want
to do the deal with?
I love all you guys. I mean,
you guys are all amazing.
O'Leary: You have
to make a decision.
O'Leary: Michael, Michael,
Michael ??
Look at me.
You can change your mind.
Mycoskie: What just happened?
You can change your mind.
I thought we had a deal!
Pan: Thank you very much.
I loved it.
I appreciate it.
Let's go!
We're gonna crush it!
Let's go! Thank you.
Pan: I've been on this path
for a while,
but still allowing your dog
room to pant ??
something we can <i>all</i>
wag our tails at.
Sharks, who's ready
to help all dogs breathe better
with a K9 Mask?
Why?
So, it's a carbon filter?
so that you guys own
majority of the company.
I would normally ask 50%.
'Cause this is ?? I'm literally
50% gonna throw away my money.
[ Whispering ]
Would you do a deal
at 40% with us?
Yeah.
A company that
I'm a co?founder of right now,
Madefor,
that's our entire mission.
I meditate every day.
It's had a huge impact
on my life.
a portion of the proceeds
of your company
We're here asking for $200,000
for 10% equity in our company.
Sharks, summertime means
soaking up the great outdoors
So what is your mission
with the company?
I don't think you can do
anything, really,
without doing some good,
as well.
I agree.
So the fact
that it's natural
There's another element
to the company.
That is, you buy one,
we plant one.
Mm.
So we've partnered up
with this amazing organization
called One Tree Planted.
Cool.
with a company
where you're competing
with the company
we already have.
Because I'm not sure,
I, regrettably, am out.
What you've been able
to accomplish is great,
but it's just not a product
that I can get excited about,
particularly with InstaFire,
you know,
'cause I think it would
create some conflicts for me
in working with them.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Mark.
Alright, well, you got
an offer on the table ??
you know, Kevin.
O'Leary: Yeah, I mean...
You want to do anything?
[ Sighs ] You want
to do it together or...?
I don't know.
No, no. Don't need
any help on this one.
While you guys think about it,
I just want to say,
I have to be super, super
passionate about it,
for their innovative
charcoal company, Prime 6,
but they have yet
to hear from Daymond.
Think about the jeopardy.
Now, I'm Mr. Wonderful
for a reason ??
'cause I'm wonderful.
But if I know
Daymond's out...
I may <i>squeeze</i> a little bit.
Greiner:
But Daymond isn't out.
Okay, Mr. Wonderful.
Why don't you starting thinking
about the only offer you have?
Let me counter.
Would you do it for 20%?
No.
Cuban: Oh, Kevin!
'Cause you don't trust your
own skills to grow the company.
I'm in this space.
It is tough. It is hard.
It's not gonna be easy
to sell restaurants
