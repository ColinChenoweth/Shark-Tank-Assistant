Blake Mycoskie, the founder of
revolutionary shoe company Toms,
returns to the Tank.
This show's not about getting
the very best deal.
It's about getting
the best partner.
We live in a time
when people are questioning
the quality of the air
they breathe.
Everything you're surrounded by
is either sugary or caffeinated.
Oron: I don't think
you can do anything
without doing some good,
as well.
Sounds expensive.
Ooh.
If Daymond drops out,
bad things could happen.
I'm gonna match Kevin's offer.
Wait, wait, wait.
Who do you like more?
I love all you guys.
It's now or never, Michael.
No. No. You can't do that.
Why would you want <i>one</i> Shark
when you can have two?
Let's go!
Hello. My name is Michael Pan,
and I'm from Portland, Oregon.
My company is...
Pan's.
And I'm here today
to talk to you about something
that's near and dear
to my heart.
Jerky!
Sharks, you're all busy
and know what it's like
to need fuel on the go,
and jerky is a convenient,
tasty, nutritious snack
people have enjoyed
for centuries.
Let's take a moment
to appreciate <i>our</i> jerky
in all of its glory.
Pan's is high in fiber
and vitamin D.
It's paleo, soy?free,
gluten?free,
and there are just
six simple ingredients
in our original recipe.
And all our flavors have
their own unique umami tastes.
Well, I didn't mean to go
on and on about our jerky
without you being able
to taste it.
I'd love for you each to take
a bite, so please go ahead.
Now, I can't wait
to hear your thoughts,
but before you share them,
I have to admit something.
That marvelously meaty texture
that you're experiencing ??
That's great.
Really good.
Thank you.
Love it.
...is actually...
mushrooms!
Mm!
That's right!
Pan's Mushroom Jerky!
John: I was wondering
why it was so soft.
I love it even more!
This is great.
We have four delicious flavors.
Oh, my God.
Original, Zesty Thai,
Salt and Pepper,
and Applewood Barbecue.
All of them have
a delicious flavor
and satisfying texture
that fans of jerky love.
Now, Sharks,
I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange for 10% equity.
Who's ready to take
another bite?
Wow, that was a great reveal.
Thank you.
These are all shiitakes,
by the way.
So, tell us your story.
How did you get into
mushroom jerky?
So, my father was
born and raised
in a small fishing village
in Malaysia.
Luckily, I had the opportunity
to go visit family
to learn about my heritage
and where I came from.
And one of these
visits to Malaysia,
there was a bowl of food
on the table.
I reached in and try it,
and immediately, I thought,
"Oh, this is great.
It must be pork."
I was really confused.
The person who served it
was my cousin,
and he was vegetarian Buddhist,
and he had been making the snack
for himself, for his family,
for people in the area
and selling it locally.
And as vegetarians,
they had a really hard time
finding foods
that not only tasted great,
but also had
a really great texture.
And mushrooms are
very satisfying
and also very healthy.
I was blown away,
and I knew at that point
that we had something
that had to be shared
with the rest of the world.
What does it cost landed,
and what's the store selling at?
We make it for $1.67.
Okay.
Our MSP is between
$7.99 and $8.99.
Who's your biggest chain
right now selling it?
Whole Foods.
Whole Foods? Okay.
Yeah, we're in two regions
of Whole Foods at the moment.
What did you say
your sales were?
In 2018, we ended at $300,000
to start off with.
In 2019,
we more than doubled.
We got to about 755K,
and I'm happy to say
in 2020 so far,
we're at $620,000 in sales.
And how many stores
are you in now?
We're in over 700 stores
right now.
And where are most of your sales
coming from?
60% of our sales are on retail,
and 40% are online.
So, how much have you
invested yourself
and have you raised any money,
and if so, how much?
Yeah.
So, I put in $100,000 myself.
And how much did you raise
from outside?
None.
All bootstrapped.
What about borrowing
or anything?
I have borrowed,
and we have a few loans,
and, obviously,
with COVID happening,
we were one of the
businesses that took
advantage of the PPP loan.
I also took an SBA
COVID Disaster loan, as well.
Would you say you're on track
to do $1 million this year?
Yes, and we think
we're gonna get 1.5.
1.5?
We're about $95,000 to $100,000
in sales a month right now.
I want to talk about something
more exciting and fun ??
Mycoskie: How good it tastes.
Yes.
Which is ??
Which is these.
Incredible.
Thank you.
Look at this.
I have none left.
You're not the only one.
Seriously,
I'm in the bags here.
Yeah.
This is fantastic.
Thank you, Lori.
Totally my cup of tea.
Now, is there
anybody else doing this?
There are others
starting to do this,
and that's obviously
why I'm here.
We want to move faster.
But we really rely on,
our taste and texture
is superior to anyone else.
Michael,
you making money yet?
We are.
Our margin's around 77%
across all channels
at the moment.
What will
the company make
if it hits its sales targets
this year?
In profit.
In profit.
So far this year,
we are netting $61,000.
So you're saying
there's a 10% profit margin?
Yes.
John: So, I'm gonna
just sum this all up.
You're offering 10%
for $300,000.
You would have to grow
the company significantly
for me to make at least twice
my money back, right?
And I like this stuff,
but for me to get my money back
and a little something extra,
it's a long road.
So I'm out.
Thank you very much.
So, I want you to know,
I adore this.
I love jerky,
but I don't want to <i>eat</i> jerky.
I don't want
to eat high sodium.
This is so healthy.
It tastes fantastic ??
all of them.
Blake and I
were talking.
Between the two of us,
we'd like to make you an offer.
And I want to share a little bit
of our thinking.
My Bantam Bagels, we got into
Starbucks nationwide,
and that was 9,000 stores.
Starbucks is great.
If you can get in there
and on their shelf,
they don't have a lot
of things to pick,
They don't.
and they like healthy stuff
like this.
Mycoskie: Starbucks is
gonna love this.
And we both have incredible
relationships there.
Yes.
And then
the Whole Foods,
Albertsons, Kroger,
even Wal?Mart ??
everybody wants
something like this.
So, our thought was
to try to blow this up
into all those places.
But Blake's gonna
tell you our ask,
because to do that,
we need to be special partners.
[ Laughs ] "Special partners."
Yeah, I mean,
here's the thing.
I only make two,
maybe three investments a year.
And the reason
I do that is,
I want to come in
and be a founder.
I want to be a partner.
I want to be, like,
really building something.
And I think this
has enormous potential.
Sounds expensive.
[ Chuckles ]
What I like about
where you are right now is,
it reminds me a lot
of where I was at Toms,
in that until I sold Toms,
I owned 100% of the business.
I brought in a 50% partner
seven years in...
Ohhhh!
...to help grow globally.
I smell 50%.
And, um...
Are you gonna
bring this offer?
It's not gonna be that strong.
Let's hear it.
That's a great way to tee it up,
though.
John: I think it's 40%.
I think it's 40.
I think it's 20?20.
What Lori and I
want to do is,
we think the 300K,
we'd love to do that,
but we need to
see 30% for us ??
15% for me
and 15% for Lori.
Michael ?? Michael ??
Now, before you interrupt,
let me just say is,
this show's not about, like,
getting the very best deal.
It's about getting
the best partner,
and a great partner is
gonna build your business...
Exactly.
far better
than 5 or 10 percent points
you might not have wanted
to give away.
So, we would love
to be your partner.
Greiner: But also,
we will blow it up.
But I'm gonna do what
Mark Cuban does all the time.
Well, Michael ??
Michael, here.
Just real quick.
I've done this before.
This would be added
to the portfolio.
I'll do 300K for 20%
if you say yes now.
No. No. You can't do that.
[ Mycoskie laughs ]
It's now or never,
Michael.
Michael has two offers
on the table ??
one from Blake and Lori
and another from Mark
for his mushroom jerky company,
Pan's.
What Lori and I
want to do is,
we think the 300K,
we'd love to do that,
but we need to
see 30% for us ??
15% for me
and 15% for Lori.
Cuban: Michael ??
Michael, here.
Just real quick.
I've done this before.
This would be added
to the portfolio.
I'll do 300K for 20%
if you say yes now.
No. No. You can't do that.
[ Mycoskie laughs ]
Because Mark does that
all the time.
It's now or never, Michael.
So, Blake ?? Blake...
Why would you want <i>one</i> Shark
when you can have two?
Don't do that.
What are you gonna do?
We are passionate
about this.
Passionate about it.
Michael, I do it ??
I've done it all the time.
It's a decision how much equity
you want to part with.
Mycoskie: He used
the word "portfolio."
You're just gonna be one
of many people in his portfolio.
No, no,
the whole point is,
they're all
plant?based companies,
so we already are
in Whole Foods.
We already have Alyssa's.
We already have Snacklins.
You're not in Starbucks.
And ??
That's not true.
That is not true, 'cause
we just got Unreal Deli...
He usually doesn't
wait this long.
You better watch.
...another plant?based,
we got them into Starbucks.
Well, all I can say ??
One of many
or someone who's gonna focus?
You have to make a decision.
You have to make a decision.
And I'm pretty much
a vegetarian.
What would you like to do,
Michael?
Wait, don't force him on...
I am!
This is a very big decision ??
his whole business.
Don't force him.
Do you understand the offers?
That's right.
It's his life.
Do you understand
both offers?
It's a lot going on in my head
right now, but...
Well, let's just highlight it.
It's $300,000 for 30%
or it's $300,000 for 20%.
And two Sharks
that are going to ??
Mycoskie:
But you get two Sharks or one.
And I'd say I'm more
than just one Shark
because I'm gonna be
more focused on this.
[ Laughs ] Yeah,
but the difference is,
I've done it multiple times.
We're really like three Sharks
'cause we're each
1 1/2 Sharks.
John: Be truthful, Michael.
Who do you want
to do the deal with?
I love all you guys. I mean,
you guys are all amazing.
O'Leary: You have
to make a decision.
Do you want a counter
to Blake and me?
I think we have an undecisive
entrepreneur right here.
Lori, let him think.
Don't worry about it.
It's only the most
important decision of your life.
I appreciate all the offers
and all the interest
and all the feedback.
It means the world to me
for how much effort
I've put into this.
It's very validating,
so thank you.
Just thank you.
It's been a really crazy year.
And...?
Um...
The equity side
is a bit too much
that I'm willing to give up.
Ooh.
So I don't know
if there's a way to ??
What would we do?
And then, Mark, I mean,
I'd love to work
with you also, obviously.
Is there any way you
come down a little bit
just to meet me somewhere?
And I have to negotiate
a little bit.
15%. Would that work?
And we can get this done
and start going.
18, you got a deal.
No. I'll do it for 15.
18, you got ??
I'll do it for 15.
O'Leary: Yes or no to 18?
You just made me an offer.
Are you gonna live up to it?
I'll do it for 15.
Mark, you got a deal.
[ Indistinct shouting ]
Unh! Unh!
I love you guys.
Mark jerked that
from both of you!
Yes!
Mycoskie:
How did that just happen?!
Thank you!
No!
We're hugging next year.
I'm telling you.
Thank you so much.
No!
I love both of you very much.
Look at me!
John: I thought you
were gonna blow that!
Look at me! Look at me!
Congratulations, man.
O'Leary: Michael, Michael,
Michael ??
Look at me.
You can change your mind.
Mycoskie: What just happened?
You can change your mind.
I thought we had a deal!
Pan: Thank you very much.
I loved it.
I appreciate it.
Let's go!
We're gonna crush it!
Let's go! Thank you.
Pan: I've been on this path
for a while,
and being the sole entrepreneur
for so long,
[Voice breaking] you go through
so many peaks and valleys,
and...
and this year especially,
seeing your bank account
go negative,
seeing people's lives at risk...
This is the biggest
one of them all,
and just to have this happen...
is extremely
emotionally satisfying.
[ Chuckling ] Sorry.
and you're looking
to start a company,
look around for things that
could be fixed or improved,
and don't be afraid
to ask questions.
John: A lot of people want
to create change right now,
and the easiest way to do that
is to mentor somebody.
I have so much hope for our next
generation of entrepreneurs.
They are out here
to change the planet
and reach for the stars,
to educate people
and keep inspiring people,
and they are inspiring me,
as well.
And we're here seeking $200,000
for 20% of our company.
We live in a time
when people are questioning
the quality of the air
they breathe,
with an increase
in smoke from wildfires,
dust storms,
and ?? oh, yeah ??
the coronavirus.
And while we've all gotten
more comfortable
wearing a filter mask
to protect ourselves
from air pollution
and other threats,
what about the ones
we <i>really</i> love?
Dogs...
[ Laughter ]
are like members
of our family.
Mycoskie: You're kidding me.
[ Laughter ]
My dogs would kill me
if I put this on them.
And that is why we created
the world's first
air filter mask for dogs,
called the K9 Mask.
Now pet owners have
a safe and effective way
to protect their pets
from air pollution
and other threats.
It's specifically designed to
fit the shape of a dog's muzzle.
Our N95
and activated carbon air filters
are replaceable,
so you can wash the mask,
because we know dogs ??
they make a super
slobbery mess.
That's right.
The canine mask also comes
in four different sizes
to fit various
muzzle shapes.
It features two
adjustable straps...
[ Laughter ]
...one around the neck
and one around the chin
to provide
a secure fit
but still allowing your dog
room to pant ??
something we can <i>all</i>
wag our tails at.
Sharks, who's ready
to help all dogs breathe better
with a K9 Mask?
Why?
So, it's a carbon filter?
so that you guys own
majority of the company.
I would normally ask 50%.
'Cause this is ?? I'm literally
50% gonna throw away my money.
[ Whispering ]
Would you do a deal
at 40% with us?
Yeah.
A company that
I'm a co?founder of right now,
Madefor,
that's our entire mission.
I meditate every day.
It's had a huge impact
on my life.
Not to be cynical, but I don't
understand how a drink is gonna
give me the same feeling
of this practice
that I've curated
over years and years.
Absolutely.
We found that meditation
helped us be a lot more focused,
a lot more creative.
But all our friends
find it very difficult
to actually get into.
And one of the key reasons
that we started this was
to help people get
an entry point into meditation.
We're trying to create a habit
in a person's daily life,
and every time somebody
actually subscribes for Moment,
a portion of our proceeds
actually goes to
helping kids in school
learn about mindfulness.
Great.
Tell us about you.
Yeah, where'd you go
to drama school?
[ Both laugh ]
So, I have been working
in supply chain and logistics
for the last 10 years.
I grew up in Pakistan,
where my dad was
a small entrepreneur.
I was fortunate enough
to get into
Harvard Business School,
which is how I ended up
moving here.
Um...
My dad would've been so proud
to see me here today,
had he been alive.
I, um...
You know, honestly, it's been
a very difficult journey.
My dad was amazing.
I remember when
I got into college,
there was people
calling him
and telling him that he should
not send me to college
because that's not
the right decision,
given I was a girl,
but my parents,
they stood up against everyone.
And not only that,
when I graduated from college,
I wanted to pursue
a professional life.
My parents pushed back
against everyone
to make sure I didn't get into
an arranged marriage situation.
I wanted to go
explore the world,
and my parents supported me
through that.
And that's how I ended up going
to South Africa.
Like, I found a job there,
I moved there,
a portion of the proceeds
of your company
and giving them back
to helping children
learn to meditate.
I'm also a huge believer
in science
and using science to help
address the chronic stress
that millions of Americans
experience every day.
The problem here is,
I would be a hypocrite
if I said that
I think a drink can do
what everything else
I think in my life has shown me,
and that is,
you got to do the work,
and you got to do the habits
so you can get to a place
where you can address
these stresses of modern living.
So because of that...
I'm out.
We're here asking for $200,000
for 10% equity in our company.
Sharks, summertime means
soaking up the great outdoors
and grilling up
a mouthwatering masterpiece.
But let's face it ?? grilling
with traditional charcoal
we've all been
accustomed to
has become more work
than it's worth.
From lugging bags
of heavy coals,
constantly
babysitting the fire,
and cleaning up
all this messy ash ??
[ Groans ]
Yikes.
It leaves you with no time
to enjoy your food
and your company.
So, Sharks, we reinvented
this outdated experience
and elevated it
to a whole new level.
We created...
Both: Prime 6!
Our charcoal is
100% sustainable, all?natural,
made solely from
repurposed sawdust.
Our hexagon shape
allows heat
to evenly distribute
throughout the grill,
burning longer and hotter
than any other.
And the best part ??
it's completely reusable.
That's right.
When you're done grilling,
simply turn it off,
close the lid to choke the
oxygen, and let the fire rest.
And when you're ready to
get back to grilling again,
you can simply
relight it.
And when it finally does burn
all the way out,
there is no cleanup.
Prime 6 is
self?consuming,
leaving your grill
with low to no ash.
Our product is all?natural
and chemical?free,
made with absolutely
no nasty fuels or additives,
to help save trees
while keeping you
<i>and</i> Mother Nature healthy
in the process.
So, tell us ??
who's burning
to light up a deal with us?
Whoo!
[ Chuckles ] Good job.
Wow.
Cuban: Good job, guys.
Can you tell us
what it's made out of?
It's not compressed coal?
It's not compressed coal.
It's actually
compressed sawdust.
We use only hardwood,
and we compress
the sawdust first,
and then we carbonize it
to create the product.
And what does it cost
versus ordinary charcoal?
We're paying less than half
on any average charcoal
because our briquettes
saves you three times
the amount of charcoal
you would ??
So, the value proposition is,
I don't have to clean up a mess,
I'm paying half as much,
I'm burning hotter.
Price point ?? for the same?size
log, it's the same price?
Yes.
So, one of these
versus the log that I might ??
a 9?pound log that I might see
at a Home Depot?
So what is your mission
with the company?
I don't think you can do
anything, really,
without doing some good,
as well.
I agree.
So the fact
that it's natural
and it's made from sawdust
is actually cleaning waste.
There's another element
to the company.
That is, you buy one,
we plant one.
Mm.
So we've partnered up
with this amazing organization
called One Tree Planted.
Cool.
And for every pack,
whether it's the 9?pound
or the 22?pound,
we plant a tree.
And what does that
cost you to do that?
$1 per tree.
$1.
You valued this business
at 2 million bucks ??
$200,000 for 10%, right?
Yeah.
You're not making any money yet
after you pay yourselves?
That's not true, actually.
We don't pay ourselves,
and we are profitable.
Wait.
You <i>don't</i> pay yourselves?
No.
But we will pay for ourselves
starting next week.
You will what?
Uh?oh!
Oh! You're pulling out
a purchase order.
What you got?
This is a $130,000,
six?figure PO from Lowes
that arrived yesterday,
and this is our first launch.
Greiner: Good for you.
Good for you.
Going next week,
making us a $450,000 company.
Okay. That's attractive.
But that's the <i>beginning</i>
of the journey.
You want to make this thing big,
you're gonna accept this offer.
You ready for it?
Yeah.
There's a reason
they call me Mr. Wonderful.
You know that.
We know that.
I'll give you the $200,000
for 25%.
Mm.
25%, and I'll tell you why.
This is gonna take work.
You got to open up doors.
I'd rather sell it direct,
frankly.
Yeah.
We did 65% direct.
Yeah,
I'd rather blow that up
because right now,
retail's chaos.
You learned yourself
how hard it is.
Yeah.
But that's the deal. It would
make me get up in the morning...
That's actually one
of the better offers
Kevin's ever made.
John: It is.
It actually is.
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.
Greiner: So, Mark and I
did a deal a few years back
with a product
called InstaFire.
Are you familiar with it?
Yeah.
InstaFire, you know,
was a fire starter.
And it's not a charcoal
briquette like this.
But my problem here is
that Mark and I
do have InstaFire
and...
Is it a conflict
of interest?
I'm concerned about that...
Yeah.
...because I don't
want to do a deal
with a company
where you're competing
with the company
we already have.
Because I'm not sure,
I, regrettably, am out.
What you've been able
to accomplish is great,
but it's just not a product
that I can get excited about,
particularly with InstaFire,
you know,
'cause I think it would
create some conflicts for me
in working with them.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Mark.
Alright, well, you got
an offer on the table ??
you know, Kevin.
O'Leary: Yeah, I mean...
You want to do anything?
[ Sighs ] You want
to do it together or...?
I don't know.
No, no. Don't need
any help on this one.
While you guys think about it,
I just want to say,
I have to be super, super
passionate about it,
and I just don't feel
that personal passion
that you guys have.
And so for that reason,
I'm going to be out.
Okay.
Thank you, Blake.
Let me tell you one thing,
Daymond, before you ??
O'Leary: Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's remember that
Mr. Wonderful made you an offer.
If Daymond drops out,
bad things could happen,
because then I have
ultimate leverage.
for their innovative
charcoal company, Prime 6,
but they have yet
to hear from Daymond.
Think about the jeopardy.
Now, I'm Mr. Wonderful
for a reason ??
'cause I'm wonderful.
But if I know
Daymond's out...
I may <i>squeeze</i> a little bit.
Greiner:
But Daymond isn't out.
Okay, Mr. Wonderful.
Why don't you starting thinking
about the only offer you have?
Let me counter.
Would you do it for 20%?
No.
Cuban: Oh, Kevin!
Okay.
And I'll tell you why.
'Cause you don't trust your
own skills to grow the company.
I'm in this space.
It is tough. It is hard.
It's not gonna be easy
to sell restaurants
for another year and a half.
I want to go
direct to customer.
I have the channels
to do that.
And I'm also Chef Wonderful.
We are not selling retail.
You know why?
There <i>is</i> no retail
right now.
It's very, very hard
to get paid.
And you're giving up 35% margin.
That's the problem.
I'd rather capture that margin
for <i>us</i> so I can wet my beak.
You understand.
I do. Okay.
Mycoskie: There's a lot
of good logic right there.
I mean,
I'm out of the deal,
but if I'm an entrepreneur
right now and I just heard that,
I think I might
take this deal.
Kevin makes
a lot of sense.
Of course he does.
He's Mr. Wonderful.
Daymond, if you don't mind,
I would love to hear...
Listen,
I am a professional griller.
Cuban: Yes, we know.
Really?
Daymond: I am.
But you are not a chef.
I'm a professional griller.
That's interesting.
I came from a neighborhood
where simple and plain,
the person
behind the grill
is the closest you'll ever get
to royalty.
That's it. Alright?
So, I'm gonna match
Kevin's offer ??
$200,000 for 25%.
Ooh, decisions,
decisions.
Well, then. Remember ??
It it just
"Who do you like more?"
