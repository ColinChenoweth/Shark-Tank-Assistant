Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kirby Holmes.
I'm from Austin, Texas.
This is my cousin.
Hey, Sharks.
My name's Evan Daugherty,
also from Austin, Texas.
Holmes: It's an N95...
An N95?
It's absolutely irrelevant.
Look, if you're by
the wildfires in California
Holmes: You're talking
about a casual situation
where your dog's
on a walk.
We're talking about
a crisis situation.
So, this is crisis masks?
Yes.
Now, that's why
we created the product,
but listen ??
here's the other things
that are happening
around the world.
When there is a red tide,
toxic algae bloom
that's around Florida...
Right.
...that is a toxin
that you don't want to breathe,
Thank you, Lori.
Daugherty: Thank you, Lori.
The one thing we really need
from somebody here
is to say, "Hey, let's lower
the cost of your manufacturing."
It's a good product,
like I said earlier.
The real problem I'm having,
the sales aren't enough.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, Mark.
Thanks, Mark.
I love where
your heart's at.
Holmes: Right. Daymond,
I appreciate the offer.
What do you want to do?
Would you be willing
to go down to 30%
No.
to be a part of this
with us?
No, I'm only giving you ??
I'm only asking 45
