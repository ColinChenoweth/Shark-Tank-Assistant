Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kirby Holmes.
I'm from Austin, Texas.
This is my cousin.
Hey, Sharks.
My name's Evan Daugherty,
also from Austin, Texas.
Holmes: It's an N95...
An N95?
and activated carbon
air filter.
How did you come up
with this idea?
So, here's the story.
Five years ago,
I'm on a date with my wife.
We're at a nice cafe.
I go into the bathroom,
and I'm washing my hands.
Young guy walks in,
looks really sharp.
Now, the problem
with that guy is,
he was wearing
a blue surgical mask.
When was this?
This is in 2015.
Okay.
And I thought, if this guy's
trying to impress his date,
it's not gonna work.
I thought, you know,
the problem with this guy is,
he needed
an air filter mask
that would accessorize
with his clothing.
Well, I decided to
start an affiliate website
with stylish and fashionable
air filter face masks.
Then in 2017,
when we saw that
the California wildfires
were beginning to increase
in volume and intensity...
There you go.
And so when I saw
on my website
somebody used the search term
on my website
"air filter mask for dogs,"
boom, it hit me.
That's a great idea.
If people are struggling
with air quality,
like wildfire smoke ??
People love their pets.
Okay. I get it
in a wildfire,
So, really,
it was for fires.
but think about the problem
you're gonna have with dogs.
Dogs, they stake out
their territory with urine.
And it's very important
when you're walking your dog
that they check out
who's in town.
Sure.
And so they have to be ??
Cuban: Yeah, but, Kevin,
that's irrelevant.
It's absolutely irrelevant.
Look, if you're by
the wildfires in California
and you're trying
to protect your pet
and you haven't
been evacuated...
Holmes: Right.
...what are
you gonna do?
Right? 'Cause your pet is ??
This is not a leisure product.
Holmes: You're talking
about a casual situation
where your dog's
on a walk.
We're talking about
a crisis situation.
So, this is crisis masks?
Yes.
Now, that's why
we created the product,
but listen ??
here's the other things
that are happening
around the world.
When there is a red tide,
toxic algae bloom
that's around Florida...
Right.
...that is a toxin
that you don't want to breathe,
and you don't want
your dog to breathe.
Correct.
O'Leary: So, Kirby,
I give you $200,000.
How do I find these
special?situation dog owners?
'Cause I can't sell to the dogs.
They don't have credit cards.
You go anywhere
that's had a wildfire.
Why don't we ask them
about their sales?
'Cause then they're gonna either
prove us right or wrong.
Cuban: Exactly.
Yeah. What are your sales?
So, $204,000 in
the last 14 months.
Ooh.
? Wah?wah?wah?wah?wah ?
Greiner: And that
includes COVID.
So, people worried
about this during COVID.
Did you get a spike?
Yes.
Now, we did $45,000 in sales
last year.
We had $159,000 in sales
this year.
I love that you
created this,
that you're caring
about dogs.
I mean, you should
have them for cats, too.
[ Both chuckle ]
Yeah,
try putting one on a cat.
Well, why stop there?
What about raccoons?
What about rats?
[ Laughter ]
What about mice?
They need masks.
We have thought about the design
for cats, for horses.
Mycoskie: We haven't got
into the pricing. Sorry.
How much are you
retailing it for?
How much does it cost?
Retails for $59.
And how much does it
cost landed to make?
Costs us $25.
They're made here?
Oh, you're made here?
So, don't you, you know ??
Another alternative's
you just get a new dog.
[ Laughter ]
Like, that is expensive.
Oh, God.
Who is this guy?
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I think it's a great execution.
The real problem I'm having,
the sales aren't enough, right?
You got to explain
to me why sales
aren't <i>dramatically</i> higher.
It would be great if more people
knew about our brand.
We need to get awareness
around this product.
Mycoskie: I love the part
of your story about, you know,
kind of seeing
what people are searching for.
But now more than ever,
people are searching for masks,
and I assume
they're searching ??
some ??
for masks for dogs,
but that's not translating
into sales.
And so that's where I have
the biggest problem with this.
No one's buying.
Thank you, Lori.
Daugherty: Thank you, Lori.
The one thing we really need
from somebody here
is to say, "Hey, let's lower
the cost of your manufacturing."
It's a good product,
like I said earlier.
The real problem I'm having,
the sales aren't enough.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, Mark.
Thanks, Mark.
I love where
your heart's at.
Like, I have four dogs myself,
and I would do anything
to protect them
in a challenging situation.
Absolutely.
But, like Lori said,
I just don't think
that you proved that there's
a big enough market of people
who are gonna pull the trigger
and spend $59 for this.
So for that reason,
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Thanks, Blake. Yeah.
Thanks, Blake.
No. I'm out.
Holmes: Right. Daymond,
I appreciate the offer.
What do you want to do?
Would you be willing
to go down to 30%
No.
to be a part of this
with us?
No, I'm only giving you ??
I'm only asking 45
