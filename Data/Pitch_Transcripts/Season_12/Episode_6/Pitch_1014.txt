Hi. I'm Aisha.
And I'm Faheem,
and we're seeking
$200,000
in exchange
for 10% of our business,
Moment.
Have you ever had
one of those stressful
afternoons in the office,
the ones that are filled
with endless meetings,
deadlines, and to?dos?
I know <i>I</i> have!
[ Laughter ]
And what makes it
even worse
is that every time
you're looking for some relief,
everything you're surrounded by
is either sugary or caffeinated.
It would give me
the jitters!
Well, that used to be the case,
until this Moment!
Moment is a natural
botanical beverage
that reduces stress
and feels like meditation!
[ Laughter ]
Moment uses
a proprietary formulation
that stimulates
the same alpha brain waves
as does meditation.
We use three primary
active ingredients
to make that happen ??
L?theanine and natural extract
of green tea.
? For focus ?
Number two is ashwagandha,
an ancient Ayurvedic root.
? For calmness ?
And number three is tulsi,
our holy basil,
an adaptogenic verb.
? For stress relief ?
[ Laughter ]
Moment is the first product
in the world
that lets you drink
your meditation.
And what makes it
even better
is that each Moment has less
than 15 calories,
no sugar, no caffeine,
nothing artificial.
And ?? Oh, my goodness!
Each one
is absolutely delicious!
Sharks, stress is
a major problem ??
today more than ever.
And this is the Moment
to solve it.
[ Applause ]
Mycoskie: Man. I mean,
what a performance.
O'Leary: Yeah.
So, Sharks, now it's time
for you to take a Moment
for yourself.
We've got all three
of our flavors
for you to sample.
On your left,
you've got Tulsi Lemon,
a drink I grew up
having in Pakistan.
You've got Rooibos Blood Orange,
inspired by South Africa,
which is
where Faheem is from.
O'Leary: Is there any
artificial sweetener in here?
There's no
artificial sweetener.
No artificial ??
Nothing artificial at all.
This is pretty damn good.
This <i>is</i> good.
Chottani: Love it!
Great.
That's great to hear.
I love the space
of dealing
with the chronic stress
in our country.
and that's
when I met Faheem.
Faheem:
So, I'm from South Africa.
I have always
been involved
in this kind
of entrepreneurial space.
My last startup
was fortunate enough
to be funded by Google
and was chosen
as the best startup
in South Africa at the time.
What was it?
It was
a consumer tech startup
that helped people share
and discover shopping deals.
Love the backstory.
Now tell the <i>front</i> story.
Now we're gonna talk
about Moment.
Awesome.
What is the game plan
for world domination?
Honestly, we got into
the beverage industry ??
we realized that we were
cockroaches in the industry
because of all
these behemoths...
That's important.
...and because of the margin
structure and distribution.
We totally understand.
That's why we chose
an online?first
distribution model.
So, we just launched
a month and a half back,
and we've already done
$15,000 in sales.
We've grown 400%
and are on track to do
$1.5 million of sales this year.
And what's the price for each
one, and what's it cost you?
Yeah, so, we sell it for $1.69,
excluding shipping.
It costs us 90 cents
to make it right now.
Shipping per can
is about 80 cents.
Do you know what your customer
acquisition cost is yet?
It's a little bit
over $20.
$20 customer acquisition cost
on how much of an initial order?
Between an $18 and a $30.
So you're losing money
on the first order.
That's totally right.
Yeah.
But we are really driving
towards a subscription model,
which drives us towards
our longer?term value.
And, honestly,
our purpose is to really
understand the customer
and build that relationship.
Guys, I mean, I see what
you're trying to accomplish.
It's, "Let's get people who are
into this lifestyle excited."
You're selling
on the improvement
that you find in your life.
That's
your value proposition.
You know, that's where
the real value comes,
and this just happens
to be the delivery mechanism
that you've chosen.
The question becomes,
is this the right vehicle?
And at $30 every two weeks,
or $15,
that's gonna be
a challenge for me.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
The beverage industry
is probably the most
difficult industry on Earth
to gain share in.
Om!
Let's talk with that
for a moment.
We embrace the fact
that it's hard.
Yeah.
But wait. It gets better.
Never in the history
of beverage,
from the time
of Genghis Khan,
has anybody got
a subscription model to work.
Ever! Never!
Not once.
But wait ?? you're gonna
try and do that.
So,
"om" on the first problem,
breaking into
an impossible sector.
And secondly, doing something
that's never been done before.
on something
you've just started.
Wait, wait, wait.
Now we go
to Greek mythology.
Greiner: Oh, no. Don't.
Oh, no!
We don't have
enough time for this!
Because Atlas was cursed...
We do not have enough time.
...to carry the Earth
on his back.
That's what you're doing.
I really like you guys.
We really like you, as well.
But you couldn't have
come into the Tank
with more weight on you
than this.
I'm out.
Listen, first off,
I just have to say,
you not only
do your father proud,
but you do
all women proud.
Thank you.
Your packaging
is beautiful.
I love it.
It draws you right to it.
But for me,
I feel that this concept,
the subscription concept
part of it,
I'm not sure about,
because I'm not sure that people
want to have delivered
their drinks.
For that reason,
I'm sorry ?? I'm out.
Thank you.
We appreciate those kind words.
I do agree that you can get
subscription models,
but in a different way.
I think if you had
a concentrated form ??
I have a subscription model
for turmeric
and a lot
of other vitamins,
which I think
that you could concentrate this
and put it in a little bottle
and squeeze it into water.
But I'm not here
to change your business model.
I see there's potentially
a lot of challenges.
So with that, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thanks for the feedback.
Okay, it's me.
Whoo?hoo!
I think that Moment
is an amazing name.
I love that you're taking
