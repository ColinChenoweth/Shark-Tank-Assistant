Hi, Sharks.
I'm Riki Franco.
And I'm Oron Franco,
and we're from New York City.
Riki:
Let me answer that.
This 9?pound actually cost
$18.99, retail price,
but it is actually equal
to 30 pounds of charcoal.
O'Leary: You sell this
for $18.99 retail,
and what's it cost you
to make it?
$3.39.
That's not bad.
We currently sell
the 22?pound to Wal?Mart
for $26.64,
and we sell the 9?pound for
anywhere from $10.99 to $12.99.
How did you come up
with this idea?
We saw a similar?looking product
in Vietnam years ago.
So, had that
stuck with you for years?
Like, you constantly talk about
"Remember that charcoal?"
We always talked about it.
We always talked about that.
And, you know, back home,
we used to grill all the time.
Like, this is something
that's part of the family ??
O'Leary: But the Vietnam story
tells me something else.
There's nothing proprietary
about this, right?
We haven't gotten
to that part yet.
One second.
You're jumping the gun.
Well, chop?chop.
We said, "Listen,
we want to be making this ??
We want to be taking
this process
and making it
100% sustainable."
What we do, we take the sawdust
when it's still raw,
we compress it under, you know,
a few tons of pressure
While it's wet?
No. You heat it up a little bit.
You get it warm.
The natural oils
from that sawdust
are enough
to bind it back to wood ??
denser than any wood
you would find in nature ??
and carbonize it
like lump charcoal.
Do you have a patent?
We have applied
for a provisional patent,
we have applied
for a design patent,
and we have
a patent pending
on the hexagon packaging,
as well.
So, how long will
this burn for?
This will burn
four to eight hours.
Really?
Depending on the size
of the...
Without replenishing.
Sales?
Yes.
So, we launched
12 months ago.
We are currently
over $300,000 in sales,
and we're selling
food service, retail,
both in stores
and e?commerce.
And how are you selling?
Are you advertising
or are you going door to door?
Distributors are
most of your sales?
Let me tell you
the story.
So, we basically
loaded the back of our cars,
and I went out driving
every day to restaurants,
to stores,
basically...
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
...selling the product.
I like it.
Mycoskie: Wow.
And then, also, I noticed
you've said the word
"sustainable" several times,
and it's at the very top
of your packaging here.
Riki and Oron have an offer
on the table from Kevin
