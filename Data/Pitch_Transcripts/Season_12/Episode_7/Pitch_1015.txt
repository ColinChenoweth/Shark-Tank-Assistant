I'm Amberly.
I'm Jennifer.
And I'm Kristy.
We're three cousins
from Houston
presenting
our Texas?sized ornament.
We're seeking $150,000
in exchange
for 10% of our business.
Do you have more Christmas cheer
than storage space?
Are you tired of spending hours
decking your halls
Do you love
big holiday cheer
but hate seeing
all the melted snowmen,
the slayed Santas,
and the roadkill Rudolphs
flattened and deflated over
lawns the next morning?
Together:
Well, we have the perfect
holiday solution for you.
Amberly: Introducing...
Holiball!
Holiball!             Holiball!
The inflatable ornament.
It's inflatable, deflatable,
and reusable.
The all?weather material
is UV?resistant.
You can easily hang them,
stake them, sit them,
and even float them.
And they're
storage?friendly.
You can fit three Holiballs
in just a shoe box.
This is the only time you'll
want to have big Holiballs
but a tiny package.
And we have the perfect
product just for you.
You have some samples here,
so let's try them out and...
Have a ball!
Have a ball!        have a ball!
So, I'm gonna take off my top
to show you how it deflates.
What I mean by that
is the top of my ornament.
Y'all dirty.
So, you pop the top,
[ Air hissing ]
pull the plug.
Takes about 30 seconds
for it to fully deflate.
Jennifer: And then to inflate
your Holiball,
you can use
any household air compressor.
We recommend
our Fast Flow Inflator,
which will inflate
your Holiball
in less than 30 seconds.

[ Whirring stops ]
So, you'll easily
insert the nozzle.
Oop!
And then put your pin in,
and then your topper.
Oops. My hands are shaky.
?That's it?
?And voilà!
Happy Holiball.
So, which one of you Holiballs
thought this thing up?
[ Laughter ]
Amberly:
I have lots of crazy ideas,
but last summer, we knew
we wanted to do something
creative together.
I shared this idea
of the inflatable ornament,
and it sparked their interest,
as well.
We do all kinds of crazy parties
in our family.
We're always decorating.
We go over the top.
We've always wanted
the big commercial decor
you see in malls
and shopping centers,
but they cost
thousands of dollars,
they weigh
hundreds of pounds,
and there's nowhere
to store them.
And so we started researching
to see if we could find
anything similar,
and we could not find anything.
In July last year,
we searched and sampled
and sourced
all types of materials,
and we finally found
this material
that not only achieved
the aesthetic that we wanted,
but also the durability.
So, in less than
120 days,
we were able to produce,
package,
and design our ornament,
ready to sell.
Wow.
Let's talk sales.
Since starting November 1st
of last year,
we're at $171,000
in sales.
Good for you!
What do you think
you'll do this year?
So, we're projecting
$650,000 in sales.
Whoa!
Cuban: And what leads you
to project that, Jennifer?
And we will profit $300,000.
How do you base
that projection?
So, last year,
the only thing
that capped our sales
was lack of inventory.
We hustled the Christmas
markets last year.
We had no money
for marketing.
In three days, we sold $30,000
worth of Holiballs.
Yeah! Good job.
We completely sold out
of two colors.
In January,
we did $115,000 in sales.
So <i>after</i> Christmas,
you did $115,000.
Yes.
Give me
a very basic number.
What does this cost to make,
and what do you sell it for?
Amberly: Sure. So, they come
in two sizes ??
18?inch diameter
and 30?inch diameter.
Is this the large
or the small one?
?That's the small.
?That costs $10 to make.
And you sell it for what?
Retail $40 and $60.
?Whoa.
?Wow.
What percentage of
your business is wholesale?
Sure. So, this year, 70%
of our business was wholesale.
However, COVID really
put a damper in our plans,
so we had to really
do a digital pivot.
[ Clicks tongue ]
Yes.
So we worked on our website,
our SEO optimization.
What's your biggest
obstacle?
So, our biggest obstacle
really is inventory.
We want to scale inventory
to get prices down.
And in order to do that,
we would need your help.
We want to move into
branding and licensing,
but also to help us
streamline the production
and really
distribution process.
For me, it's the seasonality.
that's so tough
having gone
into this space
three times now
over the last 10 years.
But look, guys,
I love it.
I think you guys
are very credible,
but it's just not a journey
I want to take.
And I would have to slam
such a royalty on this
that the ball would deflate.
[ Laughter ]
Amberly:
Mr. Wonderful, are you sure
I'm sorry ?? I'm out.
you don't want balls
in your portfolio?
I do. I have balls.
[ Laughter ]
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
The valuation is pretty high.
It's $1.5 million.
Why do you feel
it's worth that much?
So, we're basing that on our
current and projected sales.
Amberly:
The thing is, there's nothing
like it on the market,
and we feel like we've proven
that people want it
in the fact that we sold out
the first three days
that we had it
on the retail market.
But you're also at the mercy of
how other people
run their businesses ??
retailers putting it out
on the shelves
at the right time.
You know, you have a patent,
but somebody
will find ways around that,
unfortunately, right?
You're right.
It will be knocked off.
That's another reason
that we need you guys,
is to hit the ground running
before it gets knocked off.
Looking at product,
it's so visual and so much fun,
but I think you're way
out of line with your valuation.
You're projecting $650,000
in sales next year,
and I'm sure that influenced
the way you priced your stock,
but you have to remember that
that's what you <i>hope</i> to do.
I believe you'll do it,
but it's not proven.
I'm gonna make you an offer
based on where I think it is.
So I'm gonna
give you $150,000,
but I want 25%
so that I could be a full
Holiball right with you.
Thank you for that offer.
But I don't want you
to shop it around.
I'm not sure Lori has an offer,
but I'd like to beat her out.
[ Laughs ]
So you have to answer me,
but you can't entertain
another offer, please.
Whoa!
Oh, Barbara!
Amberly, Kristy, and Jennifer
have an offer on the table
from Barbara
for their giant inflatable
Christmas ornaments, Holiball,
but she won't wait for them
to hear other offers.
Corcoran:
So you have to answer me,
but you can't entertain
another offer, please.
You waited all that time to come
here, and you're not gonna ??
she's not gonna let you
listen to anybody else.
Because I know I'm giving you
an equitable offer.
I know I can help you.
What is great about this product
that you're not utilizing now,
I suspect,
is it's built perfectly
for social media
and promotion.
It's so visual.
Let me tell you
what I think.
Everybody up here
has digital access.
That is, if Barbara
will <i>let</i> me tell you.
So, Barb ??
It's certainly up to you.
I don't mean to
force an offer.
I just think
I'm the dream partner.
It's a fair deal.
O'Leary: That's the Christmas
spirit I like.
It's a perfect offer.
John: Come on, Barbara.
I wouldn't push it
if I didn't believe it.
Bah, humbug.
Barbara, we would love to
partner with you,
but we'd also like to hear
our other opportunities
with the other sharks.
That's what
I'm talking about.
Okay. Then you don't want
this offer?
So, I'm the only one
who ever licensed any
Christmas products here.
A guy came on here
with a company called
Hanukkah Tree Topper,
and I licensed that out
to Kurt Adler,
the largest company
in the space.
So my offer is,
I'll give you ??
Okay, I'm out.
Daymond,
how do you sleep at night?
How do <i>you</i>
sleep at night?!
Yeah, how do <i>you</i>
sleep at night?
He doesn't sleep at night.
You destroyed that deal.
Vampires don't sleep.
[ Laughs ]
I'll give you $150,000
for 20%,
and I will take 5% less than
what I was gonna initially offer
because Barbara's
such a mean person.
[ Laughs ]
I'll tell you what
I was gonna say.
You're gonna
let me speak ??
I think it's only fair.
This is their moment, their one
moment on the carpet, right?
Wait a second ??
do I hit that Mark Cuban
could be interested
in Holiballs?
Let me just tell you this ??
I always wanted to
meet the women who had
the world by the balls, right?
So we'll do 25%...
$150,000 for 25%,
we're both your partners.
And you get both of us.
Whoa, Holiballs!
And you're $150,000
for 20%?
$150,000, 20%,
and I got
the licenses ready.
[ Whispering ]
I'm wondering if I got to
get back into this deal.
No, you don't want
to get back in the deal.
I know! I'm wondering
if I should go in with Daymond.
No, don't go in!
Daymond, should I
go in with you?
Come on in.
Hey, ladies. Daymond and I
just went in together.
Oh, no!
So, you two in $150,000
for 20%?
For 20. Yep.
And then you two are in
for 25%.
And I'm sitting out here
like an elf in the cold.
Sure you don't want back in,
Mr. Wonderful?
[ Laughter ]
[ Whispering ]
And the challenge for shorties,
they're very unstable.
It's not easy to do
'cause you don't have
a lot of base on the snow.
So, we have riders that have
gone over 60 miles an hour
on the product
you see in front of you.
You can achieve great speed.
One thing that's been very
near and dear to my heart is,
we haven't had
a serious reported injury
in the growth
that we've had,
which has been
really tremendous.
It comes down to
the fact that when you fall,
you fall naturally.
There's nothing
binding you up.
Like, I've always heard
it's the bindings.
Yes.
I decided not to become a skier
for that same reason.
However, I did become
a pretty good snowboarder.
I'm called Chocolate Powder
on the mountain.
Can you go in deep powder
with these?
So, they <i>can</i> work in fresh snow,
a few inches of fresh snow.
How can they be in deep snow?
There's no base.
