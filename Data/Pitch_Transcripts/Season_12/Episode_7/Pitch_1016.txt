Adam: Let's make a deal.
I do believe
this is a game changer,
but I don't want you
to shop it around.
Oh, Barbara!
Bah, humbug.
And I'm sitting out here
like an elf in the cold.
[ Christmasy version
of "Shark Tank" theme plays ]
Narrator:
First into the Tank is a way
to make a big statement
during the holidays.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Katie Stephey.
And I ??
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry.
My husband
was supposed to be here by now.
A while ago, he waltzed into
the bathroom, phone in hand,
and I haven't seen him since.
He's what I call
a poo?crastinator.
In other words, someone
who wastes time in the bathroom.
Adam, are you still
in the bathroom?
Adam: I'm just doing
the paperwork! Almost done!
Okay,
it's been 40 minutes.
[ Toilet flushes ]
[ Laughs ]
40 minutes?!
[ Chuckles ]
That would explain
why I can't feel my legs.
[ Laughter ]
Hey, Sharks.
Sorry I'm late.
My name is Adam Stephey.
And I'm Katie Stephey.
And we are
from Normal, Illinois.
We are seeking $200,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company, Katamco.
And now introducing
our most successful
product line to date ??
The Toilet Timer!
?Oh, no!
?[ Laughs ]
Oh, hell no.
Ohhhh.
The Toilet Timer
is the perfect way
to tell <i>someone</i> to poop
or get off the pot.
Adam:
This is a sand timer
with a unique mechanism
that I invented.
It gives you about five minutes
to do your business
so you don't miss
anything important ??
like pitching on
"Shark Tank."
Remember, Sharks,
the Toilet Timer
will take him
from infinite scroll...
To the toilet paper roll!
[ Laughter ]
Let's make a deal and put an end
to poo?crastination.
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: Oh, my goodness.
You can't be serious.
[ Laughter ]
That's right ??
I <i>can't</i> be serious.
It's very rare.
Let me just stand up
for all men in America
and say that is our only time
where we get privacy.
Let me just tell you
a fact of toiletry.
Katie: Yes.
If your legs
don't fall asleep,
you're not doing it right.
[ Laughter ]
Well, it can be a product
that guys don't want
but that a woman looks at
and says, "He needs this."
It's just supposed to be
a gag gift, though, right?
Greiner: It is a gag.
It's primarily a gag gift,
but there's
a practical side to this.
And what would that be?
What's the practical side?
That being on
the toilet too long
can be bad for your gut
and your butt health.
I think this would be a great
time to cue up Dr. Rieders.
Hi, Sharks.
As a gastroenterologist,
I tell my patients
not to stay on the toilet
for more than
three to five minutes.
This will prevent fissures
and hemorrhoidal bleeding.
The Toilet Timer
is certainly entertaining,
but it's a medical fact
that lingering in the loo
is bad for your health.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you, Sharks,
and good luck, Adam.
Corcoran: Oh, my gosh.
[ Laughs ]
I'm trying
to be pragmatic about it,
and I give everybody
an equal opportunity.
Ooh.
However,
I'm a little skeptical here.
Uh?huh.
$200,000 for 10%.
Adam: Yeah, yeah.
Why would it go
from $250,000 one year
to a million the next year
without publicity?
That's such
a great question.
Because this year, we've already
done $318,000 of this SKU.
John: $318,000?
Katie: Yes.
And a quarter million of that
was this Father's Day, so ??
How is this possible?
What planet are we on?!
We're on Planet Poop, man.
If I can walk away
with a deal today,
I believe that I can do
$3 million in sales this year.
I thought you said
$1 million earlier.
That's right. My bank
is not scaling with me.
He can do $1 million this year
with or without us, he's saying.
That's right,
and then $3 million
if I can get some help
getting inventory.
As we've looked at the
humps that have happened
over the past seasons,
we've got
a big Christmas on our way,
and I want to be
ready for it.
I have never been ready
for a holiday season,
and I've sold out
each season.
'Cause you don't have enough
inventory. That's the problem?
You need the $200,000 to build
more inventory?
Well, no, I need $200,000
for some other stuff,
and I need some more money
for inventory.
What other stuff?
John: What other stuff?
Well,
what I'd like to do is,
with $70,000
of the investment,
I can put that towards turning
our production line in China
into a higher?volume
production facility.
But you have
great margins already.
Why would it be a priority for
you to even invest that money?
That doesn't make sense
to my ears.
It doesn't seem to me
like there would be
anything that you should
have to pay for
or supply to a factory,
if you don't own the factory,
that you would put
any money into whatsoever.
The factory should improve
their systems free
and ramp up
to accommodate you
and make inventory.
Absolutely.
You see why I'm here?
Is to learn from you guys.
Katie: Yes, exactly.
Well, don't fall down
that rabbit hole.
Do not give any factory
any money.
Just give them
more purchase orders
and tell them
that they should figure out
how to ramp up the speed
of the making of the product.
That's good advice.
I think you guys are great.
I think a lot of people
will buy it,
but it's just not
the kind of thing
where I feel like I could
come in and give you anything
that's really super beneficial
to blow up your business.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Adam, I respect sales,
and you have them.
The trouble with this deal,
though,
is you're asking
for $200,000.
Alright? This is a gag company.
I get it.
But $200,000's too much.
Okay.
Way too much for this.
I'm out.
Adam: We didn't want to look
a gift horse in the mouth.
Mark was our only offer,
and there were some things
we could have countered with,
but at that point,
I didn't think it made sense.
We're okay with 25%.
We think that we can do great
business with this product.
