We don't even know
what it sells for yet, Kevin.
We don't know
what it costs them to make.
Well, I'm excited
because a $2 million valuation
means there's
a lot of poo?poo going on here.
Mm?hmm.
We're totally
gonna get the numbers.
There's some great numbers.
Get us excited.
Christmas 2019,
quarter million dollars
in sales.
$250,000.
Kevin, how do you like
your new look?
I know I'm getting
a royalty.
[ Laughter ]
Kevin, I've seen your face
on a potato,
so I didn't think
this was a big stretch.
Yeah, listen,
I used to pooh?pooh
these kind of tchotchke ideas
until I got into Potato Parcel.
Now I'm not laughing anymore
'cause I get
a big check every month.
Let's stay focused
on the numbers,
because you're
asking for $200,000.
How much is this going to sell
this year, in your estimation?
Okay.
You said quarter of a million
last year.
Yeah. It was $294,000
last year altogether.
That's huge.
Quarter million
since December.
How do we know
it's gonna sell again?
Well, how are you
promoting it, right?
Or are people
just finding it on Amazon?
What has happened
over the past two Christmases
is Amazon's algorithms
have picked up
Okay. Thanks, Kevin.
You're thinking
this is a business.
It ain't.
It's a gimmick, alright?
My name's Kevin Greco,
Kevin, how long have you
been doing this?
I've been doing this
since 2017.
You started selling
in 2017 or...
In 2017, the company had been
around already for one year,
so they started in 2016.
Yes. Sales, Kevin.
That's how I got it.
I got the equity
because I was a sales monster.
I was eating market share.
Say that again,
'cause I love to hear it.
[ Laughs ]
"I am a sales monster."
...a sales monster!
I built myself so big that I
overwhelmed their supply chain,
That would be impossible,
Kevin.
Not deep powder.
Not, like, off trail.
Alright, Kevin,
here's my decision.
I think this product
is impressive.
I know snowboarding.
I don't know anything
about skiing.
I think there's two
other people up here for sure
that are more skilled
in that area,
but I would be doing you
an injustice,
not bringing
more knowledge to this,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
I love you.
Thank you, Lori.
You are amazing.
Any other product under the sun,
I'd be so in with you.
Problem is,
I'm not a skier.
Yeah, Kevin,
you're the perfect entrepreneur,
Good luck, Kevin.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
Good luck, Kevin.
Alright.
Barbara's, I'm sure,
been in many situations
like the one she described,
