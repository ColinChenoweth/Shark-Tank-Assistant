Hi. I'm Dahlia Rizk
from Windham, New Hampshire,
Dahlia, how many people know
this is a problem?
So, every year,
the news will talk about it
almost incessantly
starting in September.
They recommend that parents
take coats off.
A recent automobile study
found
that about 65% of parents
continue to leave coats on,
whether it's because
they don't know
or because
it's just too inconvenient.
They really don't
talk about that.
'Cause until you walked into
the Shark Tank,
I've never heard
of this problem.
I never have, either.
John:
When was that "Aha" moment
that you realized
that this was needed right now?
So, I was
one of those parents
who just really wanted to do
everything right by my daughter,
That's marketing,
and I'm working ??
Cuban: My point is, Dahlia,
you can hire somebody for that
that's really good.
Look, all of us
can help promote,
but honestly, this isn't
the right area for me.
So for those reasons, I'm out,
but congratulations.
Thank you, Mark.
I mean, what you've
accomplished is stellar.
Thank you very much.
Dahlia, I'm gonna make you
an offer of $100,000,
but I want 20%.
Dahlia has one offer
on the table from Barbara
for her car seat?safe coat
company, Buckle Me Baby Coats.
Dahlia, I'm gonna make you
an offer of $100,000,
but I want 20%.
I think you should listen
to all the offers.
Dahlia, I've got
a fantastic offer for you.
I love your business,
but I'm not greedy.
I don't need that much equity,
so here's what I'm gonna do.
Your margins are fantastic.
You can afford a royalty.
So I'm gonna ask
for $2 a unit
until I recoup $300,000.
Dahlia, I share one thing
in common with you,
Dahlia, what is the deal?
20% on the $100,000,
