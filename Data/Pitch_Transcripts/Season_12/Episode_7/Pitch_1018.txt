Hi. I'm Dahlia Rizk
from Windham, New Hampshire,
and I'm here seeking $100,000
in exchange
for 10% of my company,
Buckle Me Baby Coats.
Before we get started,
I wanted to ask you guys ??
how many of you
have been personally victimized
by a toddler?
Yeah.
Kids are exhausting,
and getting them
into the car seat safely
is a battle that gets even worse
in the wintertime.
You see, most parents still
don't know that both the NHTSA
and the American Academy
of Pediatrics
recommend taking puffy coats
off in the car seat.
The puffiness of the coat
compresses
underneath the harness,
and experts have found
that the teeniest amount
of extra forward movement
creates critical brain, neck,
and spine injuries,
or worse, they can be thrown
from the car seat.
Like all parents,
I totally wanted my daughter
to be strapped in safely.
But my reality was,
she was freaking out.
I thought to myself,
"What are my options?"
I could take her
out of her coat,
but it is freezing outside.
I could leave the coat on,
but it's dangerous.
I felt like I had to choose
between safety,
warmth, and convenience,
but I wanted all three.
I thought to myself, "Shouldn't
there be an easier, safer way?"
So I invented one.
Buckle Me Baby Coats'
patented design
opens along the shoulder seams
and the side,
allowing parents
to put the coats on at home,
put their child in the car seat
the way they normally do,
pulling the one hand through,
then pulling through
the other hand.
And the difference in the coat
is in this front panel.
When you pull it
out of the way,
it allows the harness
to sit directly on
the chest and shoulders...
Clever.
...with absolutely
no puffy fabric in the way.
The back of the coat is thinner
than the front, as well.
This allows the harness
to be pulled
to the same exact tightness
as no coat at all.
I'm sure you've had your share
of battles with your kids.
Unsafe coats in the car seat
should never be one of them.
So, Sharks, who will join me
in making kids' winter coats
exactly what they should be ??
easy and convenient for parents
and safe and warm for kids?
Dahlia, how many people know
this is a problem?
So, every year,
the news will talk about it
almost incessantly
starting in September.
They recommend that parents
take coats off.
A recent automobile study
found
that about 65% of parents
continue to leave coats on,
whether it's because
they don't know
or because
it's just too inconvenient.
They really don't
talk about that.
'Cause until you walked into
the Shark Tank,
I've never heard
of this problem.
I never have, either.
John:
When was that "Aha" moment
that you realized
that this was needed right now?
So, I was
one of those parents
who just really wanted to do
everything right by my daughter,
and I was paranoid
about her car seat,
and car seats are hard
to put in correctly,
and it's easier now than it was
when my daughter was little.
She's now 21.
She was about 5
when I thought of this.
So you've been working
on this 16 years?
No. I had to
put the brakes on it.
Why did it take 16 years?
So, when I first thought
of the coats,
I called around
to every coat manufacturer
that you could think of,
and none of them thought
that coats and car seats had
anything to do with one another.
They were simply
just not interested in the idea.
And Facebook wasn't a thing,
so I had no way
to reach parents directly.
Exactly, yeah.
And I was at the point where
I was starting my master's,
and I'm like, "I can either
do this or do that,"
and the master's seemed like
more of a sure thing.
And then as my kids grew older
and my marriage ended,
I started thinking,
"What are the things
I'm passionate about
that I've always wanted to do?"
And around that same time,
I was walking through
the parking lot,
and I saw this mother walking,
and she had
her daughter in this blanket.
The blanket was dragging
through the slush,
and she looked miserable
and defeated ??
the way I felt
when I first thought of it,
and I'm like, "I can't believe
that's still not a thing.
I'm going to make a prototype."
I threw it on Facebook.
It exploded.
And then I just scrambled
to learn the rest,
and it's been a really crazy
journey, but here I am.
Welcome to
entrepreneur life.
I know.
It's been really fun.
So, what does a coat
typically cost a parent,
and what does it cost you
to make?
They cost me between
$14 to $15 landed,
and I sell them from
$59.99 to $129.
Where are you selling them,
and how much have you sold?
I have sold about $700,000
worth of coats
in the past three years.
Whoa!
Wow!
$700,000?
Cuban: Over what period
of time?
Over the past three years,
and $500,000 was just
in this past year alone.
I've done all of this from
the ground up all by myself.
I've had no investors.
I've had no help.
I've been trying to put as
much money into inventory
instead of
into hiring people.
Where do you sell them?
75%, I sell online
through my website and Amazon,
and then the other 25%,
I sell to a big box store.
What do you envision
your sales are going to
be this current year?
My sales this year
are a little bit conservative.
My growth has been about
250% to 350%,
but around the time when
I was about to place
the order for this year
was when COVID started
to become more recognizable,
and I thought to myself ??
if I order what I had planned
to order, which was about
$1.3 million in inventory...
Wow.
...and people are stuck at home
and nobody's traveling...
I'm by myself ??
I don't have any backers,
I don't have investors ??
and this will put me under.
So what did you do?
You put the brakes on
because of COVID?19?
I didn't put the brakes on.
I just purchased
more conservatively.
And long?term, what do you
envision for your business?
If I find a coat company
that is as passionate
about car seat coats
and keeping the safety aspect ??
it's not just a gimmick ??
Then you can license it
to them.
...I'm open to
selling the company
and letting it move on
and really reach more parents.
That's what I'd like to do.
And do you have
a patent?
I have a utility patent,
but not only is it
a utility patent,
but it's a foundational patent,
meaning that it is
the first patent for a coat
designed for the car seat,
and I also have trademarks.
Greiner: That's great.
As an investor, if I ask you
"How do I get my $100,000 back,"
do I have to wait
till you sell the company?
Well, there are several ways
that I could do it, right?
So I'd really like to start
looking into
distribution overseas.
If you're interested in helping
with distribution overseas,
we could do some sort of
percentage on those sales.
Oh!
Did I hear "royalty"?
Maybe. [ Laughs ]
Okay.
So, how much are you spending
on advertising per month?
I spend about $8,000 to $10,000
on advertising,
and it costs me,
depending on the platform,
between $15 to $18
per customer.
So it's costing you $30
worst case.
Yeah.
So your worst case
is 50% margins,
and your best case
is 100% margins.
Yep.
So you're putting
half a million dollars
in the bottom line.
Yes.
Yeah,
you're investing in assets.
Yes. Yes.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
You remind me so much of myself
and the road that I went.
Oh, that's quite
the compliment.
I knew nothing about how to
create or market my product.
I had no business background,
but I just figured it out.
I often have thought back
and ask myself ??
if I had somebody
buy out my company
or if I had somebody
give me a loan,
what would I have done?
And I don't think
I'd be where I am today,
because I think the fact
that I had to play every role
and learn every facet of running
and driving a business
made me smarter and better
and able to get to
where I am today.
But I don't think
that you need a partner.
I think you're doing great
on your own.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate your time.
Lori's right. You don't need
somebody to come in here.
Can I tell you why I do?
Sure.
Yes, we'd like to hear.
Okay. I'm here
for a strategic partner, right?
And you guys
can open doors faster.
To your point,
there's still a lot of families
that don't know,
and among those that do know ??
That's not retail
you're talking about.
But that's marketing.
That's marketing.
That's marketing,
and I'm working ??
Cuban: My point is, Dahlia,
you can hire somebody for that
that's really good.
Look, all of us
can help promote,
but honestly, this isn't
the right area for me.
So for those reasons, I'm out,
but congratulations.
Thank you, Mark.
I mean, what you've
accomplished is stellar.
Thank you very much.
Dahlia, I'm gonna make you
an offer of $100,000,
but I want 20%.
And I'm gonna tell you
why you need me.
You're gonna use me
to build your business
so that you reach your goal
of selling your business,
which you clearly stated here,
and I know how to do that.
I think you should listen
to all the offers.
Dahlia has one offer
on the table from Barbara
for her car seat?safe coat
company, Buckle Me Baby Coats.
Dahlia, I'm gonna make you
an offer of $100,000,
but I want 20%.
I think you should listen
to all the offers.
Dahlia, I've got
a fantastic offer for you.
I love your business,
but I'm not greedy.
I don't need that much equity,
so here's what I'm gonna do.
Your margins are fantastic.
You can afford a royalty.
So I'm gonna ask
for $2 a unit
until I recoup $300,000.
And I want 2.5% equity
just because I think one day,
you <i>will</i> sell the company,
and I'd like to participate
in the upside
and be kind of
a partner with you.
But it's
an alternate to Barbara.
She's very greedy.
You know, 20%.
I'm not the least bit ??
[ Laughs ]
I find that disgusting.
But never mind.
You know,
the best way to get a buy
is to get a license
in between,
and I know the three people
in the space
that kind of handle
all the kids' coats.
I think that the best thing
would be to do a fusion.
I'll give you $100,000 for 20%
of the traditional business,
and it would be
30% of all licenses I bring in.
So it doesn't disrupt
your core business.
Then all the other brands
that are making the kids' coats
for Peppa Pig,
so then you get to cover
both bases.
You get to push out a lot of
stuff on somebody else's dollar
and then market
your core business
and make the money
at the same time.
Dahlia, I share one thing
in common with you,
and it's not
a bad place to start.
I have a common goal
with you.
I invested in
an apparel company, the Comfy,
and I already, in three years,
have built their business
to $250 million in sales.
I could do that
for <i>your</i> business,
and I'm
your perfect partner,
But I'll again
restate my offer.
I want to give you $100,000
for a straight 20%.
Why give up so much?
Would you be willing
to do 15%?
No.
No?
Dahlia, what is the deal?
20% on the $100,000,
and it's 30%
on the licensing.
Correct.
Okay.
Mazel tov!
Alright.
Now we have a deal!
Thank you. Thank you.
High fives.
Thank you so much.
Nicely done, really.
Thank you. Thank you.
Cuban: Well done.
I am so excited.
It went better than I thought
it could possibly go,
and I got the Shark
I was hoping for,
and I am super excited
to work with Daymond
to get so many coats into
the hands of so many families.
