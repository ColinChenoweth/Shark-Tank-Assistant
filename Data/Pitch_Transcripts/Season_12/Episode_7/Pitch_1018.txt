We don't even know
what it sells for yet, Kevin.
We don't know
what it costs them to make.
Well, I'm excited
because a $2 million valuation
means there's
a lot of poo?poo going on here.
Mm?hmm.
We're totally
gonna get the numbers.
There's some great numbers.
Get us excited.
Christmas 2019,
quarter million dollars
in sales.
$250,000.
And what does it cost you
to make this?
Just under $3 landed.
And you sell it for what?
$14.99.
You've got to be kidding.
I know.
People are crazy.
But where did you sell it?
It's primarily Amazon.
What I want to tell you
about the product
is it lends itself
to licensing very easily.
So if you'd like to remove
your black hankies,
be our guest.
[ Laughs ]
Oh! Oh.
Kevin, how do you like
your new look?
I know I'm getting
a royalty.
[ Laughter ]
Kevin, I've seen your face
on a potato,
so I didn't think
this was a big stretch.
Yeah, listen,
I used to pooh?pooh
these kind of tchotchke ideas
until I got into Potato Parcel.
Now I'm not laughing anymore
'cause I get
a big check every month.
Let's stay focused
on the numbers,
because you're
asking for $200,000.
How much is this going to sell
this year, in your estimation?
Okay.
You said quarter of a million
last year.
Yeah. It was $294,000
last year altogether.
That's huge.
Quarter million
since December.
How do we know
it's gonna sell again?
Well, how are you
promoting it, right?
Or are people
just finding it on Amazon?
What has happened
over the past two Christmases
is Amazon's algorithms
have picked up
that people like this
and they buy it,
so last Christmas, I didn't
spend a dime on advertising.
Good for you.
Good for you.
I have never ??
Thanks, Mark.
What are you on track
to do this year?
If I walk out of here
with no deal today,
then I'll do
a million dollars this year
because that's all the product
I can afford to buy.
You'll do $1 million
in this crap this year?
Okay. Thanks, Kevin.
You're thinking
this is a business.
It ain't.
It's a gimmick, alright?
And you can make
a certain amount of sales,
and it's gonna burn out.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
How much did you start
the company, this product with?
Well, my whole company
was $300.
And you're gonna do
a million dollars this year?
Yeah. For sure.
At least.
I think that's
extremely impressive, right?
Yeah.
But on the other side,
I have a personal matter
when it comes to this,
because in the ??
I think you're taking away
the <i>only</i> time that men have.
It's just something I don't
resonate with, so I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
Yeah.
So, it can be a threat
towards men,
but people
keep buying these.
Mark, do you want to add a
Toilet Timer to your portfolio?
I've always
dreamed of that.
Yeah, what I like about
this is there's always
gonna be Father's Day.
There's always gonna be
a need for gags, right?
So I like it.
Obviously, you need money
for inventory,
so I understand
why you're here for that.
So I'll make you an offer.
Corcoran: Wow.
I'll offer you $200,000
that you asked for for 25%.
25%.
Okay.
I think we should
just do that.
Hey, Mark, let's make a deal
and let's do it, okay?
Corcoran: Good.
Let's do it, baby!
What a surprise ending.
This is awesome.
[ Grunts ]
Yes!
Appreciate it.
Thank you guys
all so much,
and thank you ??
What you guys do for
American entrepreneurialism,
it's beautiful.
?Thank you, Mark.
?Bye. Congrats.
My name's Kevin Greco,
and I'm the chief
enthusiast officer for ODR.
I've been on skis
my entire life,
skied every inch
of every mountain I could
in my childhood home
of Alaska.
It was a snowy paradise
and an amazing experience,
except for the equipment.
Everything about traditional
equipment is inconvenient.
It's bulky, it's hard to learn,
and it's dangerous.
ODR skis are sleek
and hassle?free,
easy to transport,
and a total thrill.
Check it out.
With ODR skis,
you get the rush of wind
blowing through your hair
without the risk
of out?of?control riding
or runaway speed,
and without bindings
or leverage points,
the common injuries that you see
in skiing and in snowboarding
are virtually eliminated.
What you're witnessing, Sharks,
is the inception of a sport
and a brand that is disrupting
the global ski industry.
So, we're seeking $350,000
for a 10% stake in ODR.
So, who's ready to join me?
'Cause it's all downhill
from here.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: That's very cool.
Very cool.
Are there other ??
anything else
out there like this?
So, we have started
to get some competition,
but what's unique about us
is that we're
a fully integrated system.
So despite looking
like ski boots,
they're actually flexible,
like a tennis shoe.
And then, lastly, this is really
our bread and butter.
We're the only one
in the industry
using a system called
liquid steel injection molding,
and what this gives the rider
is great edge control
on harder?packed
groomed snow conditions.
Kevin, how long have you
been doing this?
I've been doing this
since 2017.
You started selling
in 2017 or...
In 2017, the company had been
around already for one year,
so they started in 2016.
And I'm sorry ??
I think I missed something.
You said somebody else
was doing this initially?
Yes, so, I joined the company
in 2017 as a distributor,
and little did I know
that in a few short years,
I'd end up owning
the global brand.
So, obviously
there was a founder.
Tell us about
that journey.
Yes. I've always wanted
to be a disrupter.
I've always wanted to work
on technologies
that are
creating new opportunities.
So I saw a video
for this product,
and I was like,
"Oh, my goodness.
I have to figure out
how to be a part of this."
So I put in $100,000
to own the distribution rights
in North America
and then just built the company
and got so powerful here
and so big with the sales
that were being generated.
So, how did you get
all the equity into your name?
Yes. Sales, Kevin.
That's how I got it.
I got the equity
because I was a sales monster.
I was eating market share.
Say that again,
'cause I love to hear it.
[ Laughs ]
"I am a sales monster."
...a sales monster!
I built myself so big that I
overwhelmed their supply chain,
and they had to
make a choice.
The choice was
I take over the company
and they come with me on a ride
to the next winter sport
or I end up as a competitor.
Whoa!
Corcoran: Hardball!
Ba?bam!
What percentage do you
own of the company now?
I own the entire company
worldwide now.
What did you pay
for the company?
So, my invested capital
was originally $100,000.
I ended up putting
in another $50,000,
and then I took on investment
to clear the buyout
of the entire company,
and that total transaction cost
another $200,000 on top of that.
Was this company originally
an international company?
Yes, ma'am.
Can you tell us
where that was?
Norway.
They were operating around
the world in over 20 countries.
And the problem with the model
is, I believed from day 1,
the key to the future
for winter sports
was a direct?to?consumer
model,
a product that was
easier to size, easier to fit,
and so I focused
on digital.
I'm a skier, okay?
Yes.
What makes this
any different
than the shorty that I have
already with a binding on it?
Sure.
That would be impossible,
Kevin.
Not deep powder.
Not, like, off trail.
And not that
that's that important,
'cause that's probably about,
what, 3% of riders?
I mean, the rest are on
regular slopes.
Correct.
What is the retail price on this
and your cost to make it?
So, it's $100,
our cost to make it,
and then we sell it
for an average ticket of $350.
And what is a typical ski boot?
Roughly $350 to $400, right?
Yes, ma'am,
and for an entire ski set,
it can be considerably
more than that.
What are your sales?
2016, $238,000 in sales.
I had yet to join
the company.
2017, I got involved halfway
through the season.
We did $660,000.
And you're crediting yourself
for that?
[ Chuckles ] Of course.
He's a sales monster.
2018, $977,000.
Okay,
what's the next year?
We're on track, conservatively,
to $1.5 million this season.
Are you gonna make any money
off the $1.5 million this year?
This year, we're going to be
approaching our profitability,
and that's because of
the direct?to?consumer
digital pivot.
You've never had
a profit to date?
We <i>have,</i> actually.
In 2018, we did $120,000.
The restriction has been
wholesale to distributors
around the world
with opportunity everywhere
versus me ?? digital, digital,
digital, digital.
John:
Kev, I got one last question ??
I just want to make sure
that I'm understanding
the story.
Sure.
A poor little guy in Norway
comes up with this great idea,
and then you come in,
and then you threaten
to take over the company
or become a competitor.
Yes.
If I become
a partner with you,
would you stab me in the back
the same way?
No. Not at all.
So, Daymond,
this is what happened.
I built just a really
tight?knit family
of customers here in the US.
I was getting to meet them,
see them,
see how it was
affecting their life.
I was getting letters,
and they're saying, like,
"I got to see
my kid out there."
"I had a bad injury. Now I get
to be with him on the slopes."
And so it was
super powerful.
And what happened was,
when my supply chain
got just restricted,
they started to manipulate me.
They started say,
"If you want it now,
it's gonna be this price."
And I'd built this
really amazing following
and family here.
And so finally, we reached
just this breaking point,
and that's when it came up,
Daymond,
where I said,
"I cannot abandon the people
that I've put my blood, sweat,
and tears into
and my money into.
We're either gonna
move forward together
or, like,
I'm gonna do this on my own."
Alright, Kevin,
here's my decision.
I think this product
is impressive.
I know snowboarding.
I don't know anything
about skiing.
I think there's two
other people up here for sure
that are more skilled
in that area,
but I would be doing you
an injustice,
not bringing
more knowledge to this,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Daymond.
I love you.
Thank you, Lori.
You are amazing.
Any other product under the sun,
I'd be so in with you.
Problem is,
I'm not a skier.
And so, unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
Yeah, Kevin,
you're the perfect entrepreneur,
and I've never said that
the entire history
of being on "Shark Tank."
And I mean that seriously.
Thank you, Mark.
You love to sell
your product
because you know
how amazing it is,
but you understand
it's not about convincing.
It's about helping.
The problem is,
I've never skied in my life.
So while I am just
wowed by you,
for those reasons,
I'm out.
I'm pretty familiar
with the ski industry,
and frankly, $1.5 million
in sales for this year
is a really small amount
in the context
of the ski equipment industry,
which is in the billions.
It's so intriguing, but I can't
get there as an investor.
I'm sorry, Kev,
but I'm out.
Barbara's still in.
What do you want to do, Barb?
I'm sitting here
on the fence,
and I keep going on
one side of the fence
and getting, "Oh, I'm going
to the other side of the fence."
I do believe this is
a game changer,
and I really believe
in your vision for the sport.
I also like
your price structure.
You basically
get into this sport
for a third of what it would
cost you to get the skis,
the boots, the bindings,
the poles.
Yes.
To the other side,
here's what's bothering me.
When I sold my business,
at the 11th hour,
one of the most important
people in my business
held me up
for a million dollars.
She said, "You either
pay me a million
or I'm going
to your rival."
Now,
what do you think happened?
I gave her the million
immediately.
She would have
spoiled the deal.
The deal would have
been off.
The idea that you held a gun
to your employer's head ??
That's not what happened,
Barbara.
Yes.
Cuban: Yeah, I don't see that
at all.
It isn't what happened,
Barbara.
Yes, I read that.
I read it that way.
I begged them for over a year,
and they wouldn't budge ??
back and forth
and back and forth
and more constricted
and more constricted.
You are
a phenomenal salesman.
You'd be the top dog
in any industry.
Thank you.
But I have to say to you,
um...
Unh?unh.
I wouldn't trust you.
I think I'd be worried
a little bit about my own back.
It's as simple as that,
so I'm out.
Good luck, Kevin.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
Good luck, Kevin.
Alright.
Barbara's, I'm sure,
been in many situations
like the one she described,
and those situations
can really scar you.
All of the Sharks, I believe,
are gonna regret
not making a deal today,
as they watch this company
grow into the future
and do amazing things.
It was <i>his</i> relationships
with the customers,
not the people in Norway.
No, but I'm gonna tell you,
that's not the tone.
The tone here was "I took over
the company. <i>I</i> did it."
Yes. That's how I felt.
And I think there was
some bravado.
That's how I felt
during the opening of it.
