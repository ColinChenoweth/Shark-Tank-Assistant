Jessica,
how much have you raised?
don't just roll over
when Jessica shows up.
"Oh, yeah,
take my freezer space from me."
Jessica, it's ?? it's incredibly
impressive what you've built.
My issue is, you know,
we're Sharks.
[ Chuckles ]
We're here to help you build
a business where we both profit.
This isn't
a vulture fund.
