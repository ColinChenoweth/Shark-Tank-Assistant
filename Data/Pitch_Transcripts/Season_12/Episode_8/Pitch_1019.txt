My name is Jessica Levisan,
founder of Peekaboo Organics.
We make super premium
indulgent ice cream
with a hidden ingredient,
and I want to challenge you
to a taste test
to see if you can figure out
what that secret ingredient is.
Placed before you
are our five original flavors.
Please dig in and see
if you can figure it out.
?Okay.
?Alright.
?I love a challenge.
?That's interesting.
Levisan:
I want you to tell me all the
different things that you taste.
Lori, what do you taste
in the first flavor?
Chocolate.
Robert, tell me
what you're tasting.
Heaven.
[ Chuckles ]
What if I told you
there was hidden veggies
in every single flavor?
I would say you're lying.
[ Laughs ] Peekaboo.
What's the one
in the middle?
This is all vegetarian?
Levisan:
That's cotton candy.
It's dairy ice cream
with hidden veggies
that you cannot see or taste.
Really?
Absolutely.
So, it's real ice cream
with vegetables thrown in?
Absolutely.
So, the mint chip actually has
two cups of spinach
in every container
of the mint chip.
Wow.
The strawberry has 14
baby carrots in every container.
Jessica, I think my kids
would love this.
They for sure would love it.

Jessica,
how much have you raised?
don't just roll over
when Jessica shows up.
"Oh, yeah,
take my freezer space from me."
Jessica, it's ?? it's incredibly
impressive what you've built.
My issue is, you know,
we're Sharks.
[ Chuckles ]
We're here to help you build
a business where we both profit.
This isn't
a vulture fund.
To come out and say
that in one year,
And for me to be ??
Jessica, just to give you
another offer
so you left with two,
I would do the $800,000 loan
at 9%,
and I want
all 8% equity.
Then you get
Mr. Wonderful.
That's actually
a pretty good offer, too.
But that's a real offer.
I'd do that deal.
There's no downside
to that offer.
Commercial lending's 13%.
I'm not putting
any covenants on this stuff
in terms of what you do.
I'm here really for equity
and equity investment,
not so much the loan.
Then you should've brought
a valuation
