I love it.
It's brilliant.
I think
it's a slaughter fest.
This, I see,
as a genius product.
You're gonna have
big companies crush you.
It will be big.
Would you be willing to
sell your whole business?
Childcare is a must
for working families
Rossiter Lewis:
Over 500 business owners
lost their livelihoods,
but we had an idea.
The chocolate
has 10 cauliflower florets.
You're asking for
a $10 million valuation.
Innovative,
high?growth food startups
are trading at four to six times
revenue multiple.
Ugh.
O'Leary:
Oh, come on.
This is ice cream
with carrots in it.
We're projecting to end the year
with $2.6 million in sales.
We're in Whole Foods, Safeway,
ShopRite, Weis Markets,
Lazy Acres ??
How did you get
to all these places?
I hustle.
So were you at a show,
like a food show,
of delicious ice cream."
I mean, it's a parenting hack.
[ Chuckles ]
How did you come up
with the idea
to put vegetables
in ice cream?
Ice cream's always been
my passion,
but really, I created this
'cause I have kids.
'cause the reality is
kids don't like vegetables.
Peekaboo really bridges the gap
between what we can't get enough
of, which is ice cream,
Have you tried it
with kids? Like ??
I would love to show you ??
I have a commercial, actually,
that we filmed.
Oh.
?Fabulous ad.
?Great idea.
It's fantastic.
So, I did an initial round
earlier this year,
It was a $5 million cap.
?$5 million cap.
?$5 million cap.
What are you gonna do in sales
next year?
A very conservative projection
for next year
would be $5 million.
Let's just think
this through.
Does anybody else sell ice cream
with vegetables?
You ??
We're the only company
on the market that sells ??
For now.
The big companies
trade at 7 to 11 times
free cash flow, okay?
like Peekaboo Ice Cream.
Unless it's cheaper
to do it themselves.
crushing you
like a frozen cockroach.
I'm aggressive with you now
because the ask is a joke.
[ Chuckles ]
It's a joke.
$800,000 for 8%?
B.S.
Are you kidding?
$800,000 ?? I would want 60%
of this company.
[ Chuckles ]
So, obviously, I'm out.
Thank you.
you created $10 million
worth of value...
I struggle with
the concept
of creating $10 million in value
in one year.
I'm sure it happens.
It happens in tech.
Cuban: You know,
along those same lines, Jessica,
I have my rules for success,
right?
Okay, I would just like to
address that because I ??
That's a great rule.
Anybody that knows me
knows this is my passion.
Um, is everybody out?
Except you.
But me.
I like what you're doing,
but I think that in my vision,
I think that you need to
improve it even a little more.
I'm a believer in
when you go healthy, go healthy,
I think
that's a great offer.
I like the concept,
but I'm halfway there.
So you could say no.
That's fine.
First, I'd like to thank you
for being the only offer.
?That's right.
?[ Chuckles ]
I can give you an offer,
if you wish.
Ohh!
My fellow obnoxious Sharks
at this moment.
No, but the truth is, I think,
really, the lane for me
is indulgent ice cream.
I think there's other
competitors there
but I would decline
for that reason.
I believe, really,
that was more realistic.
I think you got pushback ??
I mean, you can counter
on the valuation.
The valuation's
very difficult.
Everybody gave you
a hard time on that.
Right.
You're very impressive.
The product tastes great.
Thank you.
There are risks,
obviously.
Yeah.
But the way
to approach this
given what we have to do
as investors
is it's got to be debt,
because there's
no realistic valuation
that makes sense
at this point.
Greiner: But it also tells us
how bad you want a Shark.
Right, I ??
You know, everything
that we're offering you...
Right.
...tells us something,
as well.
But I can finance it.
You don't get
a Shark, though.
Yeah, but it's not
the same.
I want someone
that believes in the concept.
He's giving you $800,000.
Of course he believes in you.
Right.
It's his collateral
to get it back, his equity.
I want to get it back,
too.
You have no interest
in venture debt, right?
That's what you're saying?
?No.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
Congrats. Good luck.
Levisan: I do think
the Sharks made a mistake today.
I mean,
everyone's got their jam,
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Alex.
have just one brake light
positioned below the eye level
of car drivers.
Current offerings to this
critical visibility problem
falls way short of meeting
riders' needs ?? until now.
Introducing Brake Free,
Unlike a regular
motorcycle brake light,
Brake Free mounts at eye level
so that everyone can see you.
It lights up brighter
any time you're slowing down,
no matter how ??
braking, engine braking,
or down?shifting.
We have a utility patent
on this technology.
What does it sell for, Alex?
I'm dying to know.
It's selling at retail
at $169.
?Wow, that's a lot, actually.
?Not that bad.
Riders are expecting
to pay over $100
for anything
that's quality.
So $169
is not very much at all
for somebody that values
their safety.
Where are you selling it?
How many have you sold?
What does it cost you
to make one?
Our cost is $42
per unit.
So I should be, like,
grabbing this, okay?
But I'm not hearing
anything clear
or that gives me confidence
that you can sell this thing.
So because I lack trust
in that aspect,
which I think is more important
than the product, I'm out.
Sorry to hear that.
when products have a liability
issue that can go with them...
Mm?hmm.
...you know,
it's much more challenging.
Yeah.
I think it's necessary,
I think it's needed,
but because
it's not all worked out yet
Look, I love it.
It's brilliant.
I think it's a great idea.
But just because
it's a great product...
It will be big.
...doesn't mean
it's gonna get to market. So ??
I think we have all the money
we need to go to market,
Well, I'm gonna be using it,
Henry, so...
What do you think
of that offer?
I think Mark's been
a little quiet.
Yeah, look, I mean, Robert,
obviously, is more ingrained
in the motorcycle culture,
but I can tell you
I have a company, SURESTOP,
Guardian Bikes,
[ Chuckling ] Yes.
Yes.
Whoo?hoo!
Flying, dude.
Yes. Whoo!
This has been our dream.
I mean, this is, like, the
game plan executed to the "T."
Like, this is a dream.
I?I couldn't ask for more.
in exchange for 15%
of my company, Click &amp; Carry.
We've all been there.
We just finished
grocery shopping
Now, if you're anything like me,
you insist on doing this
in just one quick trip
You could juggle all that life
has to throw your way.
[ Laughs ]
It's with this.
It's Click &amp; Carry.
?Wow.
?Oh.
You simply twist
the Click &amp; Carry open,
Then you click the top
back into place
It has a little flexibility,
so it feels soft on the bone.
Alright, Barb,
I'm going shopping later.
I'll meet you at the store
at 7:00.
Imputes a $1.5 million
valuation.
I'm dreaming that's crazy.
Over the course of my life,
the lifetime of Click &amp; Carry,
How long
have you been selling it?
Five years,
but, I mean, listen,
if I had the opportunity
to do this full?time,
I have a million ideas
ready to go.
What do you do full time?
So I'm in
the medical?device industry.
I'm good at sales,
but it's not my passion.
This is my passion.
What does it cost you
to make it?
It's about $1.85 a unit.
By the way,
this is my seventh time here
trying to get on your show.
Wow.
in the eighth inning
of its current life.
It's not in the eighth inning.
Are you kidding me?
So, so many states ??
Well, products
have life cycles.
No, but listen.
Imagine what I could do
if I had focused advertising,
if I had influencers,
mom bloggers,
if I had do?it?yourselfers?
You're hustling this thing,
you're working full?time,
but you've got to
really hustle
Listen, every inventor
is a dreamer,
to their personality ??
"Everybody's gonna love it.
Everybody needs it."
It's that dreamer
that makes you go.
But I don't think
it's going to be
the right investment
for me.
Your ask is too big
for where I think
we'll need to go,
so I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.
I believe
that Mr. Wonderful's wrong.
This thing
is gonna be everywhere.
This is the next umbrella.
?Can I ask you something?
You seem so very nervous here.
?Sorry.
No, you don't have to apologize.
That can be a great asset.
You know,
it gets you to do a lot
or it could really
drive people crazy.
So, what percentage
of your customers
Would you be willing to sell
your whole business?
Would you be willing to
sell your whole business?
No, I?I would
if I would be able to
at least maintain
Not a possibility.
Listen, this thing
is something special.
Maybe you don't see
the spark now, but ??
It's not even an issue
of special, right?
You fought through.
You went ??
How many times did you audition
for "Shark Tank"?
Seven times.
?That's crazy, right?
?Good for you.
But it shows
where your heart's at
You're an inventor.
You're a dreamer ?? literally.
Right.
That's the challenge,
right?
Somebody's gonna have to run
this business for you.
I would certainly be open
to that.
I would be open
to bringing in a CEO.
Normally, I hate Barbara deals,
but I like this one.
Well, because it looks
a little greedy.
That's why <i>you</i> like it.
No, it doesn't.
Not in this case.
What we're willing to do
is come in together
for the $225,000...
Okay.
...but we want 40%
of the company.
Now, we'll figure out
the operations
like we have right now,
you have to pivot.
You've got to find
the path to success.
Change is inevitable,
but our "Shark Tank" companies
have continued to impress us
on how they've been able to
adapt in this challenging time.
Rossiter Lewis:
Overnight, our over 500 business
owners lost their livelihoods,
but we had an idea.
We launched
virtual flower arranging events
Childcare is a must
for working families
to help schools shift
to online learning.
At a time that we can't gather
for funerals,
we're humbled
to offer communities
one of the only digital?first
grieving experiences
to celebrate someone's life
during these challenging times.
Lomac: We took this opportunity
to launch
the Cousins Maine Lobster
mobile app
for all of our franchisees
throughout the country.
Tselikis: Instead of
event?driven business,
We're helping couples
get married online
with a directory of services
like videographers, florists,
so I took my gyms online,
Under the Weather has created
a new health?care line,
Like most parents, I'm concerned
about too much screen time,
but it was so hard to keep my
2?year?old daughter entertained
with anything else.
It's crucial for a child
to be exposed to great content,
Codi's growing library
includes 130 stories
with age?appropriate
recommendations,
100 classic songs
that make your kids move,
?So they have to police it?
?Exactly.
We started selling
in November of last year,
in December
for the holidays.
How are you
getting it out there?
Right now, we're primarily using
direct advertising
3 million people
have seen our ads already.
We're roughly making
a 10% margin,
including customer?acquisition
cost, as well.
How do I get new stories?
Is it free downloads?
It's no charge
for all the content
that we have on Codi
right now.
Although,
by the end of this year,
we do want to test out
a paid?content model.
What's your background?
So, I grew up with technology.
I went to Stanford
for my undergrad,
where I launched products
that reached millions of people,
operation strategy ??
So you have no credibility
is what you're saying.
[ Laughter ]
Not at all.
Not at all.
?So basically a real slacker.
?Yeah, pretty, you know ??
I could do better.
I could do better.
not just when it came to
English or STEM subjects,
like, if I took this home
right now,
my twins would absolutely
adore it for two hours.
I guess what
I'm struggling with is,
is the audio component
of the content
enough to continually stimulate
the kids?
Because, visually,
nothing changes.
There's been a lot
of research out there
showing that a social robot,
which is what this is,
or some kind of, you know,
smart?toy device,
is more engaging than even
animation sometimes in a TV.
Parents have been telling us,
"This is amazing.
My child hasn't used her tablet
last week.
My child is finally
going to sleep by herself."
But you guys know what
your competition is, right?
Amazon is already working on
Alexa for kids, right?
your margins drop
like a rock.
We already have a road map
for cost reduction of 10% to 15%
within the next year
with no changes
to the product.
Greiner: Listen,
you are brilliant guys.
What worries me is
the competition
of the actual
delivery platform ??
the hardware Codi.
When you first came out,
I thought it was super cute,
but I got to tell you
what I thought.
I thought that
this was a screen,
that the screen would change.
?Oh.
I worry about
the interactivity
with all the stimulus that kids
have today with the iPad.
I'm out.
You have the right combination
of brain power here
I'd like to start
as a direct?import program,
selling straight to ??
Guys, it's too late.
We're all out.
?That's interesting.
?We're done.
Yeah, guys.
Herjavec:
So, you would bring them in
I don't know
if I believe your answer.
You've thought it through.
That's not the issue, right?
I mean, it's like the dream team
of toy product.
Guys, it was very close.
Didn't happen.
We wish you the best.
You got to turn around ??
Hang on!
I'm back in.
What?
I don't believe in
the form factor,
but I believe in you guys.
I think
you'll figure it out.
But I got to make
an aggressive offer
because I see it
as a huge risk.
It's an all?or?nothing.
Corcoran: [ Chuckles ]
I'll give you the $500,000
for 25%.
Yowza!
You know what?
Codi's freaking.
So, we want to make it fair
for our investors, as well ??
No. No, I got to tell you, man,
like, I ??
Well ?? Or if we can meet
in the middle.
If we can meet in the middle,
right?
You know, just somewhere in
the middle, give us something,
I like the end I'm at.
I mean, seriously, I think...
I was out.
It's an aggressive offer,
absolutely,
but it's a pure flyer.
I've done well
with these things before.
It's $500,000 for 25%.
It's what
I feel comfortable with.
Yep. Yep.
How about 20%?
No, no.
It's $500,000 for 25%.
I mean, you guys
are the three owners.
Talk amongst yourselves.
?[ Chuckles ]
who we believe can bring
a lot of value for us.
Oh, man, I can't believe
everyone went out.
We didn't expect him
to drop out first
before working with us,
but, you know,
we're really glad
that, you know, he had faith
to come back.
Yeah! Yeah, we got it!
Yeah!
We got it. Yes.
When you come to
the Shark Tank,
you're not dead
in the water
until you're flushed out
to the sea.
Surprise ending. My God.
Whew!
