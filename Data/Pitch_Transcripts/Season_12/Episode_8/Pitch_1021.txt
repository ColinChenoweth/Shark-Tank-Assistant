Meckwood: Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kim Meckwood,
and I am absolutely thrilled
to be here.
I'm seeking $225,000
?Great.
?Kim, how much is it?
It's $9.99.
Let me get you some samples.
That's for you, Robert.
Thank you.
One for you, Lori.
Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful. My mom said
you better be nice to me.
Oh, don't worry.
Herjavec: So clever.
And, Mark,
so nice to meet you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Herjavec: Kim, it's so clever.
How did you come up with it?
So, the idea came to me
in a dream,
but the truth of the matter is
I had this boyfriend,
and when we broke up,
I had to carry my own groceries.
[ Laughter ]
I really think
that your subconscious
finds the answers for you,
and it appeared in a dream.
Okay, Kim, I have a dream
that you have sales
because you're asking me
to give you $225,000, 15%.
You know, Kim, you've proven
there's demand for the product.
It's been around for years.
You have a full?time job,
and I don't blame you
for that,
'cause you have to
take care of yourself,
and you're doing that.
Right.
But this is not a company.
It's a hobby,
and it's an interesting one.
I don't want it to be
just a hobby, Mr. Wonderful.
No, I get ??
I know what you want,
but you're asking me
to pay you a valuation
Kim, you've done an amazing job.
I applaud you.
Thank you.
Kim,
you should've come out here
with 20 grand or $50,000
or something.
$225,000
for this $9 item,
it's so hard to make
your money back as an investor
and go down that road.
I wish you the best.
I'm out.
in Kim's bag?carrying aid,
Click &amp; Carry,
but has a big question for her.
It is not.
Kim, are you sure?
You are not an operator, Kim,
period.
Why do you say that to her?
She got it to this point.
What do you mean?
Kim, that's not
fair to you.
It's true. It's true.
Look, I love Barbara.
That's a crazy offer.
You're a fighter.
You've set a record
on "Shark Tank."
[ Chuckles ]
I'm so misunderstood, Kim.
[ Laughs ]
Meckwood:
I'm in charge of Click &amp; Carry,
and I can invent
all these amazing new items
to help people,
and I get to
work with Barbara and Mark.
I am the winner.
Seven years in the making
[Chuckles] so paid off.
[ Exhales sharply ]
