Narrator:
Tonight on "Shark Tank"...
A fun and educational
storytelling robot
built on modern
smart?home technology.
This thing
is gonna be everywhere.
This is the next umbrella.
$800,000
for 8% of the company.
?Wow.
?Hello.
[ Laughs ]
Goodbye.
An elegant solution
to the safety problem.
Narrator: And later, we check in
on how "Shark Tank" companies
have been affected
by the coronavirus pandemic.
and to reopen this economy.
Scrub Daddy has had to change
every aspect of its business.
and I want to challenge you
to a taste test
to see if you can figure out
what that secret ingredient is.
Placed before you
are our five original flavors.
Please dig in and see
if you can figure it out.
?Okay.
?Alright.
?I love a challenge.
?That's interesting.
Levisan:
I want you to tell me all the
different things that you taste.
Lori, what do you taste
in the first flavor?
Chocolate.
Robert, tell me
what you're tasting.
Heaven.
[ Chuckles ]
What if I told you
there was hidden veggies
in every single flavor?
I would say you're lying.
[ Laughs ] Peekaboo.
What's the one
in the middle?
This is all vegetarian?
Levisan:
That's cotton candy.
It's dairy ice cream
with hidden veggies
that you cannot see or taste.
Really?
Absolutely.
So, it's real ice cream
with vegetables thrown in?
Absolutely.
So, the mint chip actually has
two cups of spinach
in every container
of the mint chip.
Wow.
The strawberry has 14
baby carrots in every container.
The vanilla has the equivalent
of a zucchini and a half.
Greiner: Wow.
And the cotton candy
has three baby beets.
You haven't told us
what you came here for.
Okay. [ Chuckles ]
So, what do you want?
So, I'm asking for $800,000
for 8% of the company.
Wow.
Hello.
[ Laughs ] Goodbye.
No, I'm kidding.
You must have
enormous sales.
I'm excited
to tell you about them.
So, we launched
less than a year ago,
and to date, we're in
almost 900 stores...
Herjavec: Wow.
...and we're gonna be in 3,000
stores by the end of the year.
And what are sales?
Greiner: Wow.
Wow,
that's remarkable.
So, the sales since
we've launched is $450,000.
That's it?
and all of a sudden,
everybody picked you up?
That's what happened.
Would you like ??
I can hand out pints.
?Yeah, please.
?It's cane sugar, isn't it?
Absolutely.
So you're putting
vegetables in.
I'm wondering
if you're lowering fat...
Here's the mint.
...if you're lowering sugar.
?It's indulgent ice cream.
?Okay.
O'Leary: So your pitch is,
"Look, you're gonna eat
the ice cream anyways.
Why not add
some vegetables to it?
Because particularly, kids have
a hard time eating beets.
So I'm gonna feed them beets
in a hidden form
I made it for my children
and parents everywhere
and what we don't get enough of,
which is veggies.
and I raised $1.2 million.
$1.2 million.
What valuation on that?
So, it was done ?? it was
a convertible note round
since it was difficult
to determine a valuation.
But did you put
a cap on it?
When new entrants come in
and prove a concept,
the big guys say,
"Oh, look.
Put beets in our existing
product already," and crush you.
The trend is
that larger companies
are really acquiring smaller,
innovative, high?gross startups
I can innovate,
and I can pivot really quickly.
Is your goal to sell?
My goal is to sell.
This is something we hear
very often
with very savvy,
very smart people
that come on "Shark Tank,"
that they're building
so fast
and their end goal
is to sell it.
My practical experience to date,
without exception,
has been every single business
I invested in
that had that
as an end goal
either went out
of business
or, in the end,
almost folded up their shop.
I'm so suspicious
of that.
Okay.
You know, I just think
it's a cautionary tale
because I have learned to
interpret your pitch here
as a very bad sign,
and it's pretty scary.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
The large players in freezer
that own that category
And by the time you get
to $50 million in sales,
which is basically nothing
in the ice?cream space,
you're gonna have
two or three major players
To come out and say
that in one year,
I?I don't see it here,
and I ??
I don't trust
that piece of it.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
If you go online
and look up
"Mark Cuban's rules
for success,"
number one is,
"Don't start a business
unless
it's an obsession."
Okay.
Rule number two is,
"If you have an exit strategy,
it's not an obsession."
Wow.
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
But I would like to explain
the valuation.
And then there was one.
First of all,
I'm gonna explain to you,
do you know
how a diamond's made?
Why don't you just
make her an offer
without all the B. S.,
Lori?
Okay, a diamond is carbon ??
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Stop it.
Stop it.
You have no competition.
Just make her an offer
without all the B. S.
Your mythology stories.
Come on.
I want to tell her this.
Lori, tell us about
the diamond tomorrow.
Stop. Quiet.
If you squeeze it ??
Greiner: I'm gonna tell you
how a diamond's made.
The way a diamond is made
is you take carbon
and you put it under intense
heat and pressure in the earth,
and it crystallizes.
And then they take that
out of the earth
and they facet it
and they cut it
and it turns into
a beautiful diamond.
I think sitting here today,
you reminded me of the diamond.
?Oh.
?[ Groans ]
Because under intense heat
and pressure, everybody here ??
You mean
the valuation?
No.
Everybody here threw
a lot of crap at you
and made it very difficult
for you.
I think that you were
put under intense heat
and pressure here today,
and I watched you.
And now you're a diamond.
And I think that you did
an excellent job.
Thank you.
I think that you had
smart answers for everything.
I think you held yourself.
So you may not like my offer,
and you can tell me goodbye.
?Okay.
?But you're a diamond.
?But...
?I'm a diamond.
...I would want,
if I invest in you,
to have another version
that actually is low?calorie,
low?fat, healthier option,
add the vegetables.
You have to be willing to be
open to brand extension
and to creating something
that would fit
within your brand
like that.
There are those that like
high fat and sugar,
and they'll always
like that.
And then there are those
that want a healthier option.
I beg you,
give her the offer.
What I'm going to do
is this.
This year?
I'm going to give you a loan
instead of an investment, okay?
?Ouch.
?Ugh.
Greiner: 'Cause it's risky.
Your ask is huge.
Everybody said it, right?
I'm gonna give you a loan
instead of an investment,
6% interest, three?year,
and I still want 5% equity.
You could really do well
with a strategic partner.
It's a great offer.
It's risky here.
and I feel that
this is halfway there.
But for me to do it
and step in with you,
that's what it's gonna take.
?Bam.
Only 5% equity you have to
give up. What do you say?
that do what you're describing,
and they do it really well,
and that's
a different market.
Maybe you're not a diamond
after all.
[ Chuckles ]
Hopefully I still am.
But you don't want to
go the ??
But I really ??
I appreciate your offer,
You just don't want to expand
the product line.
we're positioned as
an indulgent, delicious, and ??
And we had to listen
to all that first.
No, I get it. I get it.
And for me to be ??
Jessica, just to give you
another offer
so you left with two,
I would do the $800,000 loan
at 9%,
and I want
all 8% equity.
Then you get
Mr. Wonderful.
That's actually
a pretty good offer, too.
But that's a real offer.
I'd do that deal.
There's no downside
to that offer.
Commercial lending's 13%.
I'm not putting
any covenants on this stuff
in terms of what you do.
I'm here really for equity
and equity investment,
not so much the loan.
Then you should've brought
a valuation
and, you know,
maybe it wasn't theirs,
and, you know, obviously they
thought the valuation was high.
But for sure
they made a mistake.
For sure they made a mistake.
[ Chuckles ]
Narrator:
Next up is a product that makes
a dangerous activity safer.
And I'm Henry.
Both: And we're
Brake Free Technologies.
We're here today
seeking a $200,000 investment
in exchange for a 10% stake
in our company.
Wow.
Some of you may know
how insanely fun
riding motorcycles is,
but we all know
how dangerous it is.
I am a husband and a father
of two beautiful little girls,
so returning home safely
from my rides
is always
my number?one priority.
Motorcycle accidents
can be traumatic
and life?changing
for everyone involved
and not just those
in the accidents.
So preventing
motorcycle accidents
should be
the highest priority,
and improving rider visibility
is the best way to do that.
But it doesn't help
that many motorcycles
our ultra?visible and elegant
solution to the safety problem.
?Wow.
?That's pretty cool.
?Wow. Cool.
?That is so cool.
Turn it on,
and it stays on
with its long?lasting
rechargeable battery.
It installs in seconds
to the helmet you already own.
Just stick our universal mount
to the back of your helmet,
and you're ready to ride.
No need to wire anything
to your motorcycle
or install any apps.
It's that easy.
?Cool.
Brake Free was made by riders
and for riders,
and it's a smarter way
to be seen.
Now,
which one of you Sharks
wants to take a safer ride
with Brake Free?
?Great idea. Great idea.
?[ Chuckles ] Very cool.
Beautiful.
?Does it have a sensor in it
that determines
when it's slowing?
Yes. Yes, sir.
You took the same senors
from a phone...
Exactly.
and put them
into the device...
Yes.
...and it does the automatic
slow down, acceleration,
all that.
Yeah.
So it knows, and then
it triggers the lights
that are in the device
to react.
?Do you have a patent on that?
?Yes, we do.
?We absolutely do.
?Wow. What kind of patent?
And we have $240,000 in sales
on Indiegogo.
So these are all pre?orders
at this point.
Okay, so you haven't
shipped any yet.
Ah.
?We have not shipped any yet...
?Right. Got it.
...but we are extremely close
to shipping.
And you need this $200,000
to build inventory.
Yes, we do.
And you're confident
that this design as is,
you should go behind
and build more?
Yes.
Before you get any feedback
from customers.
I see a risk there.
This is not a product
that's for me,
so I won't beat you up
on valuation,
although I love to do that.
You know that.
[ Chuckles ]
But I'm out.
I should be, of everyone here,
the most interested party
because I had a younger brother
who was crippled
when he was run over
by a truck from behind
and the trucker didn't see
his brake lights.
Yes.
Wow. I'm so sorry
to hear that.
I think Alex and I
are both great salesmen,
and that's why we're here.
?Yeah.
This, I see
as a genius product.
Thank you.
I think that
it is fantastically done.
I think it looks terrific.
My only worry is, um,
and because there is
liability potential,
for me, I just feel
I need to sit this one out.
Sorry, I'm out.
and the money we need
from you Sharks is to scale...
Maybe.
But I think you need ??
...to tap into that
economic of scale.
I think you need the expertise
to go to market with that.
And that would be great,
as well, yes.
Yes.
We are in this space.
We know this space.
Partially why we're here.
My friends
are in this space.
One of my best friends
owned Harley Canada.
We've connected with Ducati.
We would love to be
in dealerships, as well.
Yeah, I mean, I think
you eventually have to go there,
but not today.
I'll give you $200,000
for 20%.
That's my offer.
This is gonna be on the back
of every helmet out there
'cause there is a passion
to riding motorcycles,
and this gives you
that safety.
Absolutely. Thank you.
With style to match it.
Absolutely.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
that has gone online
and just crushed it
with safety devices
for regular bikes,
but it's changing the industry.
Right.
Herjavec:
Guys, I think I made you
a fair offer today,
and this is what I do.
I mean, this is, you know...
Besides cyber security,
this is what I do.
Mark's a great guy.
If you want to pursue
a different route with him,
I'm happy to drop out.
But I think I made you
a fair offer.
Would you guys
want to collaborate together?
I think the brick and mortar
and the online together ??
Cuban: I'm open to it.
I'm open to it.
I only have one condition.
When we're riding the bike,
[ Laughter ]
That's fair.
That's fair enough.
That says a whole lot more about
you than it does me, Robert.
[ Laughter ]
I'm open to it.
Okay, let's go.
?Yeah, let's do it.
?Nice.
?Alright!
?Congratulations, man.
?Thank you so much.
?Thanks, guys.
?Great job.
?Thank you.
Herjavec:
Awesome. Great job.
?I'm super excited.
?Thank you, thank you.
?This is awesome.
?This is amazing.
Aah!
[ Laughter ]
?Oh, gosh.
?Yes.
?Thanks, guys.
?Thank you very much.
?Congrats.
?Thank you, thank you.
Congrats, guys.
Good deal. Great presentation.
Thank you.
Mark and Robert, those are
the two guys that we wanted.
and I am absolutely thrilled
to be here.
I'm seeking $225,000
and now we're faced
with the burden
of getting
all of those purchases home,
from the cart to the car
and again from the car
to your house.
and you often end up with the
grooves in your hands and arms
from carrying so much weight.
?So true.
What if I told you that I have
the solution to this problem,
allowing you to be hands?free
while you do juggling?
[ Laughter ]
you load handle bags
on each side.
The key is to
evenly distribute the weight,
and it's any bag
with a handle ??
plastic, paper,
even your purse will do the job.
and you can either carry it
in your hand, or better.
You're all set.
Wow.
So, Sharks,
who wants to help me
to Click &amp; Carry this gadget
into every shopper's hands?
Corcoran:
That's comfortable, right?
It's very comfortable
on your shoulder.
Come up and try it out.
I want to see Barbara
do this.
God, this weighs ??
this is great.
Is it great?
?Raise the roof.
?Clever.
?You can be a mule.
?[ Chuckles ]
But you know what's
particularly good about this?
And, Mark,
so nice to meet you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
and when we broke up,
I had to carry my own groceries.
[ Laughter ]
I really think
that your subconscious
finds the answers for you,
and it appeared in a dream.
I have about $625,000 in sales,
and it is not my only design.
I have so many other inventions
ready to go ??
In the last 12 months, how much
did you sell in the last ??
$70,000.
You know, Kim, you've proven
there's demand for the product.
It's been around for years.
You have a full?time job,
and I don't blame you
for that,
'cause you have to
take care of yourself,
and you're doing that.
Right.
But this is not a company.
It's a hobby,
and it's an interesting one.
I don't want it to be
just a hobby, Mr. Wonderful.
No, I get ??
I know what you want,
but you're asking me
to pay you a valuation
of a million?and?a?half dollars
for a product
that is probably
and sell a lot of these
for $9.
I hope you turn
the corner on it.
It's just not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you for your time.
and every inventor
has the same type of M. O.
with 20 grand or $50,000
or something.
$225,000
for this $9 item,
it's so hard to make
your money back as an investor
and go down that road.
I wish you the best.
I'm out.
actually come back and reorder,
would you say?
Oh, I would say
a good 70% of them.
That's a very good sign.
a certain percentage
and work for the company.
This is my baby.
I really have
so many other amazing ideas.
So, I'm gonna make you
an offer that ??
I don't mean it
to insult you, alright?
But I see it ?? it's a simple,
low?price product
that takes
a lot of maintenance,
constant marketing,
constant pushing.
What if I reversed it
and offered you $225,000,
but you kept 15%
and I took 85%?
No.
and where your head's at,
right?
No one has ever applied
seven times and gotten here.
What does that have to do
with the product?
Are you gonna fight
all those years
and all that work...
What's that?
...to give up
85% of your business?
I?I can't. I?I really know
I have something here.
It's not a business.
It's a product.
For now. [ Chuckles ]
Mark is left.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Yeah.
So here's what
we're thinking.
Okay.
and the inventory.
You focus on
creating new products.
Which you have to
bring to us.
Deal.
And yes.
[ Laughs ]
I am so excited.
You were the Shark
I wanted.
?Oh, I appreciate that.
?I am so happy.
Thank you, sweetie.
We're happy for you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
You did a great job.
Oh, thank you so much,
Barbara.
I'm gonna get you a massage
once a week.
[ Laughter ]
And Mr. Wonderful,
thanks for being nice.
Greiner: Eh.
Kind of.
and I can invent
all these amazing new items
to help people,
and I get to
work with Barbara and Mark.
I am the winner.
Seven years in the making
[Chuckles] so paid off.
[ Exhales sharply ]
In the face of incredible change
and hardship
and sold out in 24 hours.
We're now hosting
thousands of people,
allowing our business owners
to be thriving.
We know that the office
will look very different
when this is all over,
and there will be a need
for employers and visitors
to access PPE.
Bolos: So we partnered with
a local design firm
to offer the world's first
glass?mounted PPE station.
and to reopen this economy.
We launched
a new learning platform
we now take our trucks to
neighborhoods and communities.
We've had to focus on
opening ourselves
to new points of distribution ??
restaurants with takeout
to specialty groceries ??
and we're also offering pallet
discounts on our product.
We've pivoted our farm creamery
into a full?service
drive?through farmer's market,
allowing our community
a safer way to shop
than in crowded grocery stores.
Sean: During
the stay?at?home orders,
our large?group scavenger and
treasure hunts weren't possible,
so we launched the Adventure
Hunt Quarantine Challenge
to help people have some fun
and stay active at home.
Here at Wine &amp; Design,
we're selling paint kits
and offering virtual classes.
It's actually helping
our franchisees
keep their doors open.
and home?decoration kits.
Everyone's stuck at home
trying to learn
how to cut their own hair.
We've done eight times
the amount of sales
that we normally do.
But it's about giving back,
so we've hired over 50 barbers,
we would give them some income
in exchange
for social?media content.
This pandemic forced me
to close my physical locations,
and business has been
better than ever.
Whoo?hoo!
That's what I'm talking about!
Krause: In order to stay open,
Scrub Daddy has had to change
every aspect of its business,
including temperature checks,
wearing masks,
and safe distancing.
The result has been a happy
and safe work force.
including
the brand?new IntubationPod
which protects first responders
and medical workers
from airborne contagions.
You'll never succeed at business
unless you welcome change.
Herjavec:
You've got to adapt to survive.
Don't be a dinosaur.
Not many of those around.
Greiner:
The more creative you are,
the better your chances
to stay successful.
As we emerge from
the pandemic of 2020,
there's gonna be two types
of companies ??
those that think that
they can do business the same
and those that are agile
and adaptive
and realize
the world has changed,
and this is when we step up,
this is when we innovate,
this is when we create.
Narrator:
Next up is a way to engage
children using technology.
My name is Dayu,
and I'm a technologist.
My name is Chris,
and I'm a toy maker.
My name is William,
and I'm an educator.
Together, we're the founders
of Pillar Learning...
Together:
The creators of Codi.
And we're asking for $500,000
for 10% of our company.
especially content that supports
social and emotional learning.
Social robots have shown to be
more engaging for children,
and they avoid all the negatives
of a screen.
That's why we created Codi,
a fun and educational
storytelling robot
built on modern
smart?home technology.
Codi is engaging,
beneficial,
and, let's face it,
incredibly cute.
and even a slow playlist
for calming down or sleep.
Plus, Codi can respond
to simple questions
designed just for kids,
and parents can control
and monitor all of this
from the Codi app.
Don't our children deserve the
best in smart?home technology
in a package that's designed
just for them?
So join us in bringing Codi
into every child's home.
We've got some samples
to pass out to y'all.
So, here you go, Robert.
You can grab the monkey.
?Alright. Is this Lori's?
?Yeah.
?Yes. [ Chuckles ]
?Lori.
?[ Laughs ]
?Thank you.
Kevin, we're gonna give you
this one here.
?Monkey. [ Laughs ]
?Thank you.
?Why do I get a monkey?
?[ Laughs ]
Yang: It might be a good idea
to show a brief video
of how Codi is actually getting
used in a real family.
Greiner: Okay.
? <i>Got a plan</i>
<i>to take a stand</i> ?
? <i>Before a sticky situation</i>
<i>gets out of hand</i> ?
? <i>So close your eye??</i> ?
?? <i>Clean up everywhere</i> ?
?[ Chuckles ]
I don't get
the interactive piece.
For example,
in that video,
the boy was being congratulated
for cleaning up.
How does the child interact
and get a conversation,
a sociability
back and forth?
So, the parent would actually
control through the app,
and there will be different
steps for each habit.
So it's time
to start cleaning up,
and whenever
they're done with it,
the mom or the dad
could press the button,
say they're done, and
that's when it gives them the ??
And what's the age target
for Codi?
Children ages
1 to 7 years old.
What does Codi cost?
Costs the customer $99.99
in retail,
and the actual cost is $25.76
for us to manufacture.
That's not bad.
How many have you sold?
We've sold
approximately 2,500 units.
Wow.
We've done $260,000
in sales
selling on our own website
and Amazon.
and we started our first
deliveries to customers
through Facebook
and Instagram ads.
and I joined a top social?
and mobile?gaming company
and I got my MBA
from Wharton afterwards,
and I spent two years
at the Boston Consulting Group,
and that's where I really
refined my business acumen,
?Yeah, I mean, you know.
?And Chris and William?
I went to Stanford
with Dayu.
I studied international
relations and Chinese.
After graduating from Stanford,
I got into the toy industry,
I brought thousands of toys
to market,
from concept to shipment.
I actually went to high school
with Dayu,
and after I graduated
from UC Berkeley,
I worked in international
curriculum design
as well as
education consulting.
So as I was working with
all those students,
I saw there were gaps
in their learning ??
but, really, when it came to
social and emotional learning.
So right after that,
I decided to change careers
and find where the roots
of those gaps were,
and I became
a kindergarten teacher
in Washington, D. C.,
for two years.
Good for you.
So, actually, on Sunday,
I graduate from Stanford,
as well...
Congrats.
...with a master's
in education.
Thank you.
This category is, uh, very,
very competitive because ??
Brutally competitive.
I mean, if you could get a child
to play with this
for even 12 months,
I'd be amazed,
'cause you don't have
that data yet, right?
Herjavec: Chris,
my challenge with it is,
And you've seen some of it,
I'm sure.
That's your competition,
and that's big companies
competing with you.
Now it's just a question
of form factor.
Form factor is really
your only true differentiation,
but other people are gonna
come up with "cute"
the minute they see that this
is having the success it is.
Now what happens to you?
How do you guys
compete with that?
I would say
other than a technology,
we really have
this human touch.
So every interaction
and every story you're hearing,
Codi is directly acted
by a professional voice actor.
We really want Codi or our
products to be in every home.
So retail is important.
So you want to be
in Walmart,
you want to be Target,
wherever.
Exactly, and if we don't
make money, that's fine.
Because if you're gonna sell it
at $99 retail,
and the cost are brutal.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Guys, I think you've done
an amazing job
from a product?management
perspective.
But at the end of the day,
I just worry that the kids
are gonna get bored
to pull out a product like this
and make it work,
but I don't feel
it's ever gonna make money,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
Cuban:
I love your execution.
I'm still not sold
on the scale,
and you guys
haven't convinced me.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
O'Leary:
I've often told people
that if you've done something
bad here on Earth,
you go to Hell and you work in
the toy industry down there.
That's what happens.
Oh, it's not that bad.
It's pretty bad.
It's pretty bad.
Both Google and Amazon have
product coming in this category.
I think it's a slaughter fest.
I mean, you guys are going into
a battle from Hell.
I'm out.
So, next year, we're projecting
$16 million in revenue.
That's the sale
of 240,000 Codis.
?But what changes?
?Why do you project that?
'Cause that's pretty
pie?in?the?sky.
Yes, it is ??
And why would you say that
after every Shark is out?
That's a ??
It is an extremely
ambitious goal,
but we're
an ambitious company.
But, Chris, how are you
gonna fund that?
Like, the amount of inventory
and cost to do that...
Sure.
So, I have
a very good relationship
with our manufacturer.
They're actually our biggest
investor in our company,
and so our incentives
are highly aligned.
and we would be getting
P. O. s then
directly from
these retailers,
and I would be servicing them
as direct imports
and you would sell
directly to them?
Effectively,
you're gonna build to order?
Right.
Yeah, and so, Mark,
this is how you can help.
You can help us
with your connections,
you can help us get into ??
accelerate
these retail discussions ??
Guys, we've told you
all the reasons it doesn't work,
but I got to tell you,
every time
we've given you a reason,
you ?? you have
a good answer.
A good answer.
And I don't really believe
in the form factor,
but, man,
you guys are great.
our current investors,
and also, obviously ??
you know we want some more
equity skin in the game
so we continue to be motivated.
So would you be okay
with 15%?
and we can make it work.
Yang:
The decision to give up 25%
was definitely difficult,
but we're getting a deal
with Robert,
