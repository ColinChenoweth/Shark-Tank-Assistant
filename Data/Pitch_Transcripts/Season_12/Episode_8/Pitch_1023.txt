My name is Dayu,
and I'm a technologist.
My name is Chris,
and I'm a toy maker.
My name is William,
and I'm an educator.
Together, we're the founders
of Pillar Learning...
Together:
The creators of Codi.
And we're asking for $500,000
for 10% of our company.
Yang: It might be a good idea
to show a brief video
of how Codi is actually getting
used in a real family.
Greiner: Okay.

I don't get
the interactive piece.
For example,
in that video,
the boy was being congratulated
for cleaning up.
How does the child interact
and get a conversation,
?Yeah, I mean, you know.
?And Chris and William?
I went to Stanford
with Dayu.
I studied international
relations and Chinese.
After graduating from Stanford,
I got into the toy industry,
I brought thousands of toys
to market,
from concept to shipment.
I actually went to high school
with Dayu,
and after I graduated
from UC Berkeley,
I worked in international
curriculum design
as well as
education consulting.
So as I was working with
all those students,
I saw there were gaps
in their learning ??
Herjavec: Chris,
my challenge with it is,
But, Chris, how are you
gonna fund that?
Yang:
The decision to give up 25%
was definitely difficult,
but we're getting a deal
with Robert,
