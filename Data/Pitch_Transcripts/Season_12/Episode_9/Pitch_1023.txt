Hello, Sharks. I'm Fran Harris
from Dallas, Texas.
Hooooo!
Yeah!
Fran, how would you spend
the $350,000?
Could you break
that down for me?
Production will probably
be somewhere
There is no data on
sell?through here, Fran.
Barbara is Fran's last chance
for a deal
for her sports drink company,
Electra,
but she wants a much bigger
stake in the business
than the 20%
Fran came in offering.
I'll give you $100,000
cash up front,
a $250,000
line of credit.
But because it's
a high risk deal,
I want 40%
of the business.
?Yowza. Yowza.
?Ooh!
?Ooh!
Who's getting
that ass now?
Barbara, I really, really,
really appreciate that offer.
that, you know, frankly,
it's a fractured system
that I look forward to breaking.
I wish I could believe
that you're building a category,
but I don't see that
as a category.
I see it as a chair
with a new design element.
Well ??
It doesn't get me
all excited.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Greiner: The problem for me
is whenever somebody comes in
