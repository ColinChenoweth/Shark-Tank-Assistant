Hello, Sharks. I'm Fran Harris
from Dallas, Texas.
Hooooo!
Yeah!
And I'm seeking
$350,000
in exchange for 20%
of my company.
Sharks, the sports drink
category
is a $23 billion opportunity.
The problem is that
a lot of these companies
who are purporting to have
"functional hydration"
are actually
putting water in bottles
that are full of
nothing more than sugar...
...artificial colors
and ingredients...
...and, you guessed it, salt.
Sharks,
consumers are not going to
settle for a sports drink
that over?promises
and under?delivers,
leaving you feeling tired
and sluggish.
You know why?
You know why?
Why?
Why?                        Why?
Because there's
a new sports drink in town,
and she's got game.
Introducing Electra,
a better?for?you functional
beverage hydration company
that's going to change
the sports drink game forever.
Sharks, I played
on an undefeated Division I
women's basketball team
at The University of Texas.
I also played on the WNBA's
first championship team
with the Houston Comets.
So safe to say I've consumed
a lot of hydration
and sports drinks.
And I can tell you
without a doubt
that everyday athletes,
hustlers, and doers,
what they're looking for,
an Electra delivers
on every single one of those.
And yeah, there's
some competition out there.
But let me tell you, Sharks,
we are coming for that ass.
[ Laughter ]
So, there's really only
one question remaining.
Who's ready to electrify
their hustle,
end the tyranny
of these sugary sports drinks,
and help me raise
this billion?dollar baby?
[ Chuckles ]
Good job.
Corcoran:
Great. Great pitch.
Are we going to try these?
Yes, you are going to try those.
So, those are the three flavors.
There is Litty Lemonade,
there is Passion Punch,
and there is "Oh, Yeah!" Orange.
Passion Punch is good.
Is there a particular
top seller?
So, those are
our launch flavors.
You haven't sold
any yet?
Good question, Kevin.
[ Laughs ]
Already you show
how wonderful you are.
No, we haven't sold them.
We literally just launched
about 10 days ago.
Wow.
Okay?
What do you use
to sweeten it?
We are using monk fruit
to sweeten it.
The question that we will
get to either sooner or later...
Mm?hmm.
...is you mentioned
a few competitors.
Now, they're not just
ordinary competitors.
They are bone?crushing monsters
who own this category.
What is the plan for you
to get distribution
in the bone?crushing
business...
Bone?crushing.
...of sports beverages?
Well, Kevin,
you heard my background.
I'm not afraid
of competitors.
I've competed all of my life.
Yeah. And she's
not afraid of you, Kevin.
And competition
is a good thing.
The plan is to go direct
to consumer online, but ??
Shipping...
a 12?pound box?
That's going to be
expensive.
Let me finish.
The plan is to go
direct to consumer
as well as to go to retail.
My background is
I was a salesperson
for Procter &amp; Gamble,
so I'm very familiar,
have a lot of experience
in the CPG market.
So I get the freight. I get
how expensive it's going to be.
But I also believe that you have
to go direct to consumer
because there are a lot
of consumers online
who are looking for hydration,
and we need to be there
just like we need to be there
in retail.
So, why did you decide
to go with a drink
as opposed to a mix?
Because once you are hustling
and you're active,
you want to walk into
a convenience store or store
and you want to
grab something then, right?
You don't want to grab a water
and then grab your mix
and then have to do all that.
But I think the convenience
factor is a big thing.
And I get that.
It's just getting
that space...
Totally.
...in the cooler, right,
is hard,
and then trying to be
direct to consumer...
Sure.
...is even harder
'cause of shipping costs.
You've got to be mixed
direct to consumer.
That's a 24?pound case, 12.
That'll weigh 24 pounds.
?Agree.
Agree. I think it's important
to be both.
I think it's important
to be on shelf,
and I think it's important
to have a mix
that people can order online.
The shipping's gonna be less.
As somebody
who works out,
I always have to
replenish potassium.
So, the amount
of potassium
relative to
the amount of calories
is really good.
Thank you.
So, that's a positive.
My challenge is, though,
with the Mavs,
I already have two big deals
with sports drink manufacturers.
Okay.
So, I can't touch
anything at all.
But I just got to tell you,
the formulation is great,
the taste is great,
but unfortunately
for those reasons, I'm out.
Are you working full time
on this now?
I am.
Where are you
manufacturing this?
So, we manufacture it in a
little place called Coppell,
which is right outside
of Dallas.
Are you going to be using
a distributor?
Yes, we actually just ??
I got an e?mail today
from one of the largest
distributors
who wants to see
a sale sheet on it
because I dropped
some of it off last week.
And what is your first
production run going to be?
The first production
run will probably be
between 20,000 or 30,000.
And where are you getting
that money from?
We have some at that meeting,
and hopefully the rest of it
will come from
this little audience right here.
So, you can't
take that product in
until you get the money
from us, right?
That's right.
Good job, Barbara.
Fran, how would you spend
the $350,000?
Could you break
that down for me?
Production will probably
be somewhere
between $20,000 and $30,000.
Okay?
In terms of R&amp;D,
probably $25,000 or something
like that, however that goes.
So, a total of
about $50,000.
And the rest of the money,
what would you do with that?
So I would also hire someone for
logistics, sales, and marketing.
Greiner: So, first of all,
I love you
because I love
your straightforwardness
and your strength
and your confidence.
I would be uber excited
about you,
but the drinks themselves
aren't really my cup of tea.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
You're out?
Thank you, Lori.
O'Leary: You have a very
impressive background.
Your pitch was flawless.
There is no data on
sell?through here, Fran.
You are running, and you want
to take my $350,000...
I do.
...and experiment on...
"I do.
Absolutely, I do."
...whether this
can work or not.
You don't have enough data
to do that.
I don't want to
discourage you,
but I also don't want to
see you crash and burn.
Confidence is not enough.
I hear what you're saying.
First of all, I win.
All I do is win.
So, even though
I'm new in this category,
I'm going to continue
because I know
that I'm going to be able
to carve out
a niche place for Electra,
and then we're going to win.
We are coming for that ass.
That's it.
[ Laughter ]
Okay? Alright.
Any other category, any other
product, anything else,
that kind of, you know,
confidence would be very useful.
Look, I wish you the best.
I really do.
That's alright.
But I'm not taking
this ride with you.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
So, okay.
Turns out you're not
so Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you for that.
Oh. Oh. Oh!
Corcoran: Whoa.
Daymond.
I don't want to agree
with Kevin,
but I've had a lot of challenges
with this area,
and I just wouldn't be able
to help you with this
'cause it's just
so difficult.
So, I'm out.
Okay, thank you, Daymond.
Barbara,
it's just me and you.
CORCORAN: It's okay.
I don't mind an empty room.
That's a lot.
Yeah.
I wish
you hadn't come in here
and pitched
a beverage business.
I rarely agree with Kevin,
but I do.
It's the worst
possible space.
The very first money
I lost on "Shark Tank"
was to a small company guy
with fire in his belly,
great conviction, right
formulation named Chill Soda.
I lost that money
in a month. Boom!
So, it's
a terrible space.
So, for you to stand here
and be so fearless,
you're a hell of a salesman.
When I heard that pitch,
there wasn't
a single word wasted.
But I'm not willing
to risk $350,000.
I'll tell you
what I'll do.
I'll give you $100,000
cash up front,
a $250,000
line of credit.
But because it's
a high risk deal,
I want 40%
of the business.
?Yowza. Yowza.
?Ooh!
?Ooh!
Now who's wearing
the rings?
?Ohh!
?Ohh.
Who's getting
that ass now?
Barbara.
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
Barbara is Fran's last chance
for a deal
for her sports drink company,
Electra,
but she wants a much bigger
stake in the business
than the 20%
Fran came in offering.
I'll give you $100,000
cash up front,
a $250,000
line of credit.
But because it's
a high risk deal,
I want 40%
of the business.
?Yowza. Yowza.
?Ooh!
?Ooh!
Who's getting
that ass now?
Barbara, I really, really,
really appreciate that offer.
And I can't tell you this
until we decide whether
we're gonna work together,
but I have some things
that are in place.
You might
want to tell me now.
I should tell you now?
You think so?
Oh, yeah.
It's "do lose."
I do have
a couple of Hall of Famers.
One is an NFL Hall of Famer,
one is an NBA hall of Famer
who are ready
to come to the table
to bring their influence
to move this product.
Not their cash.
Both of them are cash.
Both of them are cash.
Well, then.
Yes, both of them
are cash.
Good for you.
So I told them that ??
Thank you for hiding that
until everybody was out.
See? I wanted to see
who was with me, Barbara.
I wanted to see
who was with me.
Maybe.
And these are real offers
that are on the table.
So, I like your offer,
but not for 40%.
Would you be willing
to take
25% for the same deal,
and we have a deal?
I'll give you ??
or I'll take 30%
if you could bring
those two big fish in with us.
And if not,
all bets are off.
So if I can't get both of them
in, you're out completely?
If you don't
bring them in,
you don't get
the $100,000,
you don't get
the credit line.
You're going to have to take
a gamble yourself here.
But I think
that's only fair
because I'm taking
a huge gamble myself.
So, I'm not sure
that I want both of them.
Oh, you're not sure?
That I want both of them.
I can get both of them.
I'm going to trust you that
if you could get the good one,
then yes,
I'll do that.
But if you don't get them,
you don't get anything.
You'll do, what,
30%, Barbara?
Yeah, 30%.
You bring
the big fish in,
and still, the structure
of my deal is the same ??
$100,000 with
$250,000 credit line.
You drive a hard bargain,
Barbara.
Say yes.
It's a good deal.
But she has no choice.
Yeah, she has
no choice.
What did you say, Mark?
I just said
it's a great deal.
He said
you had no choice.
I always have a choice.
There's no choice
when it comes to Barbara.
I always have a choice.
I love the deal, and I'll take
your deal, Barbara.
You got it, baby.
I wish I could hug you,
but I can't, but let's go!
CORCORAN: I'll make up
for it later, all the hugs.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Cuban: Congratulations.
Greiner:
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
When Barbara makes an offer,
you have no choice.
You have to
take that deal.
Whoo!
There's no question ??
beverages are difficult,
but all I've done
all my life is win.
And with Barbara on board,
I know I'll keep winning.
Whoo!
We are coming for that ass!
I think it's a good deal.
You know,
you only get to live once.
Why live in Hell?
So they can
hang out with you, Kevin.
Come on!
[ Laughter ]
that, you know, frankly,
it's a fractured system
that I look forward to breaking.
I wish I could believe
that you're building a category,
but I don't see that
as a category.
I see it as a chair
with a new design element.
Well ??
It doesn't get me
all excited.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Greiner: The problem for me
is whenever somebody comes in
and they have
something different
that can really be good,
but they're just starting...
Yeah.
...and they want
to get a Shark,
I always feel
the smart thing to do
is to be a lot smarter
about your valuation,
because if you get somebody
in and alongside with you,
you could take a one?off item
like this and blow it up,
which is what
I'm good at.
Sure.
So, if you had had something
that was just more realistic ??
because I just feel
it's so out of whack.
For me,
it just turns me off.
And for that reason,
unfortunately, I'm out.
That's fair.
There is a competitor company
that just had a
$200 million valuation
on, you know,
just a little higher sales.
I actually work
with one of the bigger guys,
Varidesk.
Sure.
And the whole theory
is the desks raise up
and the chairs that they sell
are a little pole, a chair,
so you have to
balance yourself.
Sure.
This would be
a conflict with me.
So I'm out.
I started choking
on the valuation,
and I'm still
choking on it.
Okay.
I tried the chair,
and it has merit.
But 500K for 2.5%?
I don't get out of bed
for 2.5%.
