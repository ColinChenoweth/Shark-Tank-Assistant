My name is Bing Howenstein,
and I'm the CEO of All33.
I'm here today
to ask for $500,000
for a 2.5% ??
Hello.
Corcoran: Wow.
...piece of our company.
Bing, baby!
I know
it is a very serious ask,
but that's because it is for a
very serious problem ?? chairs.
They may be killing you.
Now, you've all heard,
sitting is the new smoking.
Well, they are right.
Sitting for any length
and period of time
is really bad for you,
and chairs, well, they've had
the same basic design
for almost 3,000 years.
Whatever you're sitting in,
even the fancy expensive chairs
you guys are sitting in
right now,
you can find yourself
locked, stuck, immobile,
and, a lot of times, in pain.
And for all of us
working at home these days,
this is just not okay.
Well, I have some
really good news for you.
Corcoran: Oh!
[ Chuckles ]
Whoa!
All33 is here
to save the day,
but don't just take it
from me.
Let's hear what one of our
biggest fans has to say.
Hey, Sharks.
I'm Justin Bieber,
and this is the All33.
It's the chair
that moves like I do.
I mean, guys, look at
this perfect posture.
Got my chest up,
my shoulders back.
I'm ready for anything.
I mean, have you guys
ever seen a chair
that can do this?
I'm doing a full
ab workout right now.
Alright. Hit me up later.
I'll be back.
If you got to sit,
this is it.
Now, Justin knows
what he's talking about
because this is our patented
Sit?In?Motion Technology.
It's like a chair
within a chair,
and it rocks,
just like our sales.
Now, you don't have to have
moves like Justin
in order for this chair
to work for you,
because all you have
to do is sit,
get fit,
and All33 of your vertebrae,
well, they're going to
keep moving all day.
Now, <i>this</i> is a chair.
Now, Mr. Wonderful...
Yes.
...you're looking particularly
uncomfortable.
I am.
Would you like to come up
and take a seat...
I would.
...and see what
we're talking about?
I have a bad back
from a squash injury.
Oh, well, then,
let's see what happens.
Howenstein:
Make sure you get your behind
all the way
into the back of the chair.
Scooch back there.
Alright.
And you can probably feel
the rocking motion
move back and forth.
Very interesting.
Why is this
making me sit up straight?
Why does that happen?
So, the patents that we have
about this
are really quite unique.
Basically,
Dr. Dennis Colonello,
who invented this,
he's been doing this
for a long, long time ??
he's got 45 years
of treating backs, necks,
and everything else ??
he figured out,
let's get
your hips moving,
almost as if ??
what you're experiencing
is a sensation that's almost
like you're standing,
but when you're sitting.
It is moving all 33 of your
vertebrae while you're sitting,
and there's nothing else
in the world that is doing it.
I'm very skeptical about
all these claims on chairs
'cause I've tried
so many,
and I also have tried different
devices to help my back.
This thing actually
is working.
I don't care
about Bieber.
I'm going to kick his ass
when my album comes out.
[ Laughs ]
I don't like
your valuation, though.
Well, we can
talk about that.
Yeah.
I would expect
that from you.
Tell us, how did you get
into this, and what happened?
So, I have been a patient
of Dr. Colonello's
for about 20 years
and then friend.
I'm also a bit
of a serial entrepreneur.
I got into making products
and getting products sold.
Along the way, I got into
the back care space.
When I sat on Dennis' chair,
an early prototype,
I said, "This is
a whole different ball game."
But I knew that Dennis was never
going to get this thing going.
As a friend, I said,
"Let me help you.
I'm going to do
a Kickstarter for you."
So, we did that.
It performed very well.
What's very well?
We did $800,000.
That's very well.
That's great.
Did you license it from him?
Are you
partners with him?
Howenstein: No, no, no.
I own a small piece of it.
How much of the company
do you own?
I own about 5%.
So, a premium chair
in today's market
sells for roughly $2,000,
a real premium chair.
What does this sell for?
We're selling this for $799.
What's your margin?
What's it cost you to make?
So, our margin's around 67%.
Our cost delivered to a customer
with all that good stuff
is about 260 bucks.
2.5%. $500,000.
$20 million valuation.
Yep.
How many chairs are you selling?
How many dollars?
So, this year alone, we've sold
about 3.2 million.
We're on track to hit
five and a half.
Okay, and what are you going to
make on five and a half?
So, we were slightly profitable
in the second quarter,
and we expect to be the same
in this third quarter.
I mean, just help me
because, you know,
I'm a quick study
in most sectors...
Sure.
...office supply, furniture,
or even,
if you want to call this
high?end chair design, whatever.
Maybe it would trade for
11 times pretax cash flow.
I mean, I'm not saying
it isn't a great chair,
but it's a chair.
Yeah.
Why is it worth
$20 million?
We are looking at comps
for other companies
that are out there
in a very similar space
that are three to four times
revenue.
We know we're going to
get there.
We have also talked
to the market. Not my opinion.
20 million bucks
is a pretty good valuation.
So, then why
are you here?
Why am I here?
If you talked to so many people
that gave you that valuation,
why are you here?
Because Shark money
is better than other money.
So, you're charging
us more than...
No.
...your sales
because we're Sharks?
I'm prepared to give you
a discount
because you guys
are Sharks.
<i>Can</i> you give a discount?
I am the CEO of the company,
and I'm here to make a deal.
You're a marketing company,
first and foremost.
You've got
your product, right?
It's got its angle.
It's got its differentiation.
Sure.
And that's good,
right?
I just don't want to be
in the chair business.
Sure.
You know?
It's just ??
Of all the businesses,
big and small,
not that there's anything wrong
with the chair business,
but it's just not for me.
Okay.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
That's fair.
Thank you.
If you had
come in here today
and you wanted to
sell me a chair,
you're the perfect guy.
But you weren't here
to sell a chair.
You here to sell
a business.
Correct.
And you said you're
a 5% owner?
Correct.
I, for some reason,
feel it lacks credibility.
Okay.
I think that's a good lesson
for other entrepreneurs.
You can't
send a salesman in.
Well, with all due respect,
this is my life right now,
and to ?? it's a bit
of a denigration to call me
a simple salesman on this deal.
Barbara's very good
at pissing everybody off.
Well, that's fair,
and you can do that.
But the fact is,
that is not
what is happening here.
I'm here to build a company.
We are building a movement
in a category
that hasn't been done before.
We're going up against
the big guys
Bing, I can't do it.
Well, I'm more than happy to
have you on a higher place
in the cap table,
with just a little more money.
I don't want to beat you up.
My routine would be
to squeeze your head
like a teenage pimple,
and I feel like doing that...
[ Laughs ]
...but I don't want to,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
I will buy one,
though.
Well, you're going to have
to pay full price this time.
I guess I will.
Oh. Bam!
Alright.
Thank you, Bing.
To have Barbara
just call me a salesman,
I think that was
a bit offensive,
and I don't think any
entrepreneur wants to hear that.
When you put your blood,
sweat, and tears into something,
I find that particularly,
you know, not cool.
