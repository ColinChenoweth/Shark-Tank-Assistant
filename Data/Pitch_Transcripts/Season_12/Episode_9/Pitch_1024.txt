My name is Bing Howenstein,
Bing, baby!
I know
it is a very serious ask,
but that's because it is for a
very serious problem ?? chairs.
They may be killing you.
Now, you've all heard,
sitting is the new smoking.
Well, they are right.
Howenstein:
Make sure you get your behind
all the way
into the back of the chair.
Scooch back there.
Alright.
Are you
partners with him?
Howenstein: No, no, no.
I own a small piece of it.
How much of the company
do you own?
I own about 5%.
So, a premium chair
in today's market
sells for roughly $2,000,
a real premium chair.
What does this sell for?
We're selling this for $799.
What's your margin?
What's it cost you to make?
So, our margin's around 67%.
Our cost delivered to a customer
with all that good stuff
is about 260 bucks.
2.5%. $500,000.
$20 million valuation.
Yep.
How many chairs are you selling?
How many dollars?
So, this year alone, we've sold
about 3.2 million.
Bing, I can't do it.
Well, I'm more than happy to
have you on a higher place
in the cap table,
with just a little more money.
I don't want to beat you up.
My routine would be
to squeeze your head
Thank you, Bing.
To have Barbara
just call me a salesman,
I think that was
a bit offensive,
