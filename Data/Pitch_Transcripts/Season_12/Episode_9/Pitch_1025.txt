Wow.
Let me break it down
for you real quick.
His &amp; Her Bar
is the most fun...
Sexy, interactive
food product around town.
We use seven aphrodisiac
super foods
that will stimulate
sexual desire
and bring you and your partner
closer together.
Okay, that's what
I'm talking about.
Our bars will want to
make you have sexy times
Jennifer: So, as you're
consuming the bar,
it's going to have
a creamy consistency
with an earthy
and nutty flavor.
That's gonna come
from the ??
Oh, it's spicy, too.
Got a little
spice in there.
Exactly.
Is there any difference
in the formulation
between his and hers?
All the ingredients collectively
are good for him and for her.
It is really
spicy, though.
Yeah, so, you're going to have
a little hint
of cayenne at the end.
When you get to where
you get that little hint ??
<i>Little</i> hint?
No, that's a spice.
That's a spice?
How many calories
are we talking about here?
So, the bar has
220 calories.
Cuban: Damn.
That's a lot of calories.
Whoa!
It's all natural, though.
It doesn't taste
so sweet, though, at all.
Well, you're going to burn
those calories off.
Exactly.
Maca ?? Actually, maca is
a Peruvian sweet root vegetable,
and in Peru, maca is known
as the Peruvian Viagra.
So, it really just depends.
Really?
Yeah.
How much maca
is in this?
Michael:
So, for each bar,
there's 0.7 ounces
of maca per bar.
How much in advance
do you eat it,
and are you suggesting
somebody should eat a whole one?
So, it's meant to be
like a lifestyle bar.
So, with Michael and I,
like, we like
to enjoy it together.
We call it
sexy snack time.
And, you know, sexy snack time
doesn't always have to mean
that it's going to
allude to sex, right?
It's about that connection,
and right now in today's world,
people are craving
that connection.
Do you have children?
We don't.
We do not have children.
Well, that explains
an awful lot.
A <i>whole</i> lot.
Can you tell me how you came up
with the idea? It's crazy.
So I served in the Navy.
Thank you
for your service.
Thank you
for your service.
Michael: Thank you.
I appreciate it.
So, fast forward
to 2015,
we live in South Florida,
and I get hired on
as a firefighter.
And one of the things
I was excited about
being a firefighter
was the brotherhood,
the connection.
Maybe I remembered that
from my time in the military.
And as a few months
went by,
I started to notice
that I couldn't connect
with the people
in the department.
So, a few months pass.
Chief brings me
in the office and he lets me go
for basically not being able
to fit in with the crew.
And I'll never forget,
I'm on my way home that day,
and I hadn't even told
Jennifer what happened,
and I'm trying to figure
everything out,
and I go to get gas
for the car,
and on the top of the gas pump
is a rock,
and there's writing
on the rock,
and the rock said ??
I picked the rock up
and it said,
"Just when the caterpillar
thought the world was over,
it became a butterfly."
True story.
True story.
So, you get home to Jennifer,
you say, "I met a rock,
and it talked to me."
I said, "Babe."
And she said,
"I got to dump this guy."
[ Laughs ]
I know, right? It's kind of
cheesy for a firefighter.
You know what, though?
We're very serendipitous.
So, a little bit about myself.
I graduated from
the University
of South Carolina,
and I went to the wonderful
world of corporate America
and soon to find out
that it was not for me.
I did really well in the job,
but something was missing.
So in 2015, I left
my six?figure corporate job,
I cashed in my 401k
and my savings,
and I went all in
to start an activewear brand.
Oh, no competition
there.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, well, exactly.
I learned a lot of lessons.
But Michael's job,
when he was doing his job right,
it was supporting us because
it was money in, money out.
It was a very capital
intensive business.
So, basically when Michael lost
his job, we needed to pivot.
So, we ended up
selling our house
because it was about
to go into foreclosure.
Oh, my.
We moved across country
from South Florida
to Scottsdale, Arizona,
to basically hit
the reset button.
So, in January 2019,
I wrote down an intention
to create a product
that would be regularly consumed
and better the lives
of other people.
Is that this product?
This is this product.
Okay, so...
But we didn't launch
until June this year.
Reason being ??
So, let's talk sales.
So, we have sold
500 bars.
How many dollars
is that?
A little over
$2,000.
I just went limp.
$2,000?
You got to be kidding.
So, let me just
tell you right now. So...
Oh, my ?? $2,000?!
Okay, we knew you would
say that, Mr. Wonderful.
We were waiting for
this moment.
$2,000?!
Kevin, how excited
are you right now?
I'm not!
Have we forgotten
what we're in right now?
I'm not trying
to come up with excuses,
but we are in the middle
of a very challenging
time in business, right?
But you knew the problems
that were out there, Jennifer,
'cause you've been
through a launch
before with
your activewear, right?
Jennifer: Totally.
And you know
how expensive it is
and you know how important it is
to have a receptive market.
Why did you launch it at all
and why not wait?
Good question. So we were
actually working in a restaurant
while we were building
our business.
And so, in March,
we got furloughed.
Even worse.
Even worse, I mean, because
now you have to buy inventory.
Right?
You have to do marketing.
That's obviously
why we're here, right?
We need to be able to build
the brand recognition.
I think you need a job.
Cuban: You do need a job.
No, I mean ??
This is
our full?time job right now.
That's not good, guys.
You've already
had to downsize.
You've already had
to sell your house.
Yeah.
You're allowed to have
a job while you have a company,
and you can still be completely
committed to your company.
I worked as a bartender
at night.
Yeah.
I worked at Red Lobster
for five years
while I started FUBU.
Michael, this is just too early
for an investment.
And I have to relate
to a product.
I just don't relate to it,
and I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
You know,
I probably need this product
more than any other woman
on Earth.
I haven't had a sexual thought
in probably 30 years.
[ Laughter ]
But I'm going to try
this product.
But I want to address something
other than the product.
I've noticed a lot of people
start businesses
after they're fired,
as though that's also a rock
or a message that you get.
Like, "Oh, I should be
working for myself."
It doesn't mean that at all.
It's supposed to mean,
"I should get another job."
I really wish you
the best of luck, but I'm out.
We have enough expenses
to cover
our living expenses
for the rest of our lease.
Greiner:
Let me talk to that, okay?
Okay.
So, every
entrepreneur thinks
they're going to create
the next best thing.
But you have to
remember something.
Not every idea you have is going
to be that perfect winner
right out of the gate.
But you keep creating,
and you have no idea
if that next thing is going to
be your million dollar idea,
because it could be.
And I'm a firm believer,
and I've seen it happen a lot.
But because I don't think this
one's your million dollar idea,
I'm sorry, I'm out.
O'Leary: This isn't
a business yet.
One of you has to get a job
just to have the safety net.
Michael is getting emotional
pitching his and Jennifer's
aphrodisiac bar, His &amp; Her.
Michael: [ Voice breaking ]
God, I just want to ??
Can I just
tell you a story?
When I was growing up,
I want to be a firefighter,
and I go through
the fire academy
and I fail,
and I'm determined,
right?
So, about
a few months before...
...I'm supposed to go
into my second fire academy,
I start ?? I start getting
these headaches
and, um, I don't know
where they're coming from.
And I go to the VA, right?
I get it checked out, you know?
And the next day,
they call me back
and they tell me that they found
a small brain aneurysm.
And I still have it
right now.
Look, Michael,
you got to remember something ??
as entrepreneurs,
we fail multiple times,
multiple times,
over and over again.
I've lost millions of dollars
with bad ideas
I didn't know were bad
'til I realized
they didn't work.
The hallmark
of an entrepreneur ??
you've got to pick yourselves up
and you got to get going again.
You know what?
I understand.
We're over here
and you're over there,
and we need more
than just finance,
and we need more
than just connections.
We need mentorships.
We need a strategic partner.
This is what we need.
I'm staying focused
on the fact
that this is
an investment opportunity.
I'm not saying
you're not fantastic people,
but this is not investable.
I'm out.
What I'll tell you is
that we have grit.
I've been called crazy,
delusional,
that I need to, you know,
I need to give up, right?
If I gave up,
I wouldn't be here today.
Cuban: Look, guys, how much
do you have in inventory?
We make as we go.
Smart.
Look, you're in
the circumstances you're in.
I don't question your heart.
I don't question your desire.
I don't question
your authenticity.
Every one of us has had
our backs against the wall.
I can't tell you how many times
I was so stressed,
if ate 50 of these,
it wouldn't change my sex life.
But things happen. So you'll
figure out your personal side.
You'll figure out
the job side of it.
Right? You don't need to spend
any more money on this.
So, keep on fighting like
you're fighting, build to order.
You guys can do this.
I'm not going to invest
because you're not ready.
In your lives,
you're not ready yet.
Product wise,
you're not ready yet.
So, guys, I'm out.
Good luck, guys.
Alright. Just so you guys know,
one thing really quick is
that we didn't get to talk
about the vision for the brand.
It's not just
a one?hit wonder.
We're going to be
doing other bars.
At this point, that's not
what it's about.
Not for any of us, because
it's got to be investable.
O'Leary: I wish you
the best of luck, okay?
John: Good luck, guys.
Cuban: Good luck, guys.
Alright, that's it.
Greiner: Good luck,
and good luck with your health.
