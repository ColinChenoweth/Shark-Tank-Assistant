Walsh: I don't know about
you, Sharks,
but when I win,
I want everyone to know.
Whoo!
Oh.
We have sold
a little over $2,000.
$2,000?
Greiner: Whoa!
I think you need a job.
This is our full?time job
right now.
That's not good,
guys.
[ Sniffles ]
Can I ??
Can I ?? Can I ??
Can I...
God, I just
want to ??
Can I just
tell you a story?
more people learning about
this product is what matters.
More social media.
There's 100 million customers.
O'Leary:
One thing I've learned about
the whole Basepaws experience
is people love their pets,
and I think what Anna's done
is allowed people
to learn more about an animal
they can't actually
communicate with.
But now they can through DNA.
They can there forecast
the future
of how to keep it
healthier longer
and give it a better life
in their own home.
Skaya:
I feel so proud to be here
talking about our growth
over the last year and a half.
So many times I looked
at this company and thought,
"Can we really do it?"
But between our team,
our community, our pet parents,
we have really proven
that there is a huge market
in the cat business.
and do the mattress mambo.
Or should we say
the pants?off dance?off.
[ Laughs ]
And based on our personal
experience,
let's just say...
Both:
These bars work!
So, Sharks,
one more time for you.
? Our bars or will make you move
around the set, set ?
? We're looking for $50,000
at 10% ?
? Best money in the world
that you'll ever spend ?
So, Sharks,
for your tasting pleasure,
we have some
sexy treats for you.
Oh, yeah.
Cuban: That's pretty good.
So, you can pick up your bar,
and we'll do a little cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
O'Leary: Cheers.
Cuban: Cheers.
John: Cheers!
I'm nervous
Barbara's gonna jump me.
[ Laughter ]
of just pushing through
no matter what.
Yeah.
So, it doesn't matter
what happened today.
I'm a big believer that
everything happens for a reason
and we're just thankful
for this opportunity,
and we know that
it's going to get us
exactly where
we're meant to be.
Narrator:
Next into the Tank is a product
to take your victories
to the next level.
My name is Matt Walsh,
and I am addicted
to winning.
And I'm Dax Holt, and I fully
support his addiction.
And we are here
seeking $600,000
for 8% of our company,
TrophySmack.
Over 50 million Americans
pour their hearts and souls
into fantasy sports every year
for a chance at victory.
Friends battle it out
for months on end,
smack talking
one another,
investing ridiculous amounts
of time and energy
for the winner
to walk away with what,
empty bragging rights,
a generic Little League trophy?
I don't know about you, Sharks,
but when I win,
I want everyone to know.
And that is why
we created TrophySmack,
the best place to get
the most unique
and customizable
fantasy sports trophies,
blinged?out rings,
and over?the?top
championship belts.
I mean, imagine walking into
your next draft party
with this bad boy
on your shoulder.
Whoo!
So, it's super simple.
You go to our website,
you choose your sport,
then your size and your color.
There are literally
thousands
of trophy combinations
to choose from
to create your very own
dream trophy.
So, we understand
how important winning is
here inside the Tank.
So, we went ahead
and we custom?designed trophies
for each one
of you Sharks.
Wow.
So, go ahead and unveil
the greatness next to you.
Wow.
I like mine.
A golden slipper.
O'Leary: A bull and bear.
Stock market, baby. Wall Street.
Cuban: I actually like
the one I already have
that's in my office.
[ Laughter ]
How did you guys
come up with this?
So, it happened
in the most organic way.
Credit card out, looking
for something awesome.
I'm in the finals.
I'm the new guy
in the league
with all the dad friends,
and it didn't exist.
So, just joking
with the guys,
I said, "Hey, guys.
I wanted to just get
a six?foot trophy,
and I wanted to ride it in
like a pony
to show you guys
how much I obliterated you all.
But since it doesn't exist,
I have to start my own now."
But I don't get why
that doesn't exist.
I have ordered trophies
for my business my whole life,
every type of trophy.
Why couldn't you use
a regular trophy house?
What's the difference
here?
So, the trophies
that exist today,
just sort of that
same antique?looking ??
Yeah, with the guy
with the ?? you know,
standing on top.
Exactly. Everyone was kind of
selling the same thing,
so when we came
onto the scene,
we were the first company
where we had the ability
for someone to change the colors
on the fly,
change the side
on the fly.
John: That does look cool,
I will say.
Did you design it?
We design everything.
So, what are
your backgrounds?
Professor of mine
gave me invaluable advice.
He said, "Matt,
if you want to be
a really successful
entrepreneur,
you need to get into
supply chain and logistics
to really figure out
how businesses operate
and how they function
and execute."
So, first job
out of college,
I took a job
at a freight brokerage.
I rose to the top
of the company in two years.
Wow.
I was the number one
salesperson in the company.
Cuban: It brings up
a good lesson for people.
Whatever you're doing,
be the best at it.
Be the best at it, yeah.
Because once you're the best
at something,
every door opens up
and then you learn where
you can be a great entrepreneur.
So, good for you for focusing
on being great at what you did.
Absolutely.
My background is completely
the opposite.
I come from TV and film
doing entertainment news, "TMZ."
How much did you invest in
this business to get it going?
We invested $250,000.
Whoa.
Wow.
That's a lot of money.
Why do you have to invest that
much to get this going?
That's not messing around.
What is it
you spent your money on?
Walsh: So, in the beginning,
we started small.
Initially, it was
a $60,000 injection,
and in the first three weeks
of getting into the fantasy
football draft season,
sold out of everything.
What's the average cost?
The average price
is about $150, $160.
What does it cost you
to make it?
Our average profit margin
is 80%.
80%?
Wow.
Wow.
Dang.
Can you walk through the revenue
growth first year,
what you sold,
what you made?
So, Year 1,
January 2018,
we did $850,000
of revenue.
Amazing.
Your first year?
Wow.
What did you make?
What did you make on the 850?
The first year, we had
about a $200,000 net
that we just rolled right into
inventory for Year 2.
Okay.
And then next year ?? '19?
And then,
Year 2, 2019,
we did $1.9 million.
Wow.
Okay, and you made
what on that?
We had $775,000
gross profit,
and we netted
around $500,000.
And this year,
what are you going to do?
Year to date?
Walsh: So, in spite
of the pandemic,
our revenues year to date
are up over last year.
We've done $650,000
revenue so far.
The opportunity for us
is a lot broader than fantasy.
So, corporate awards,
employee recognition, U sports.
But there has to be a ton of
competition in that space.
A ton.
There's a reason
why no one
in the trophy and award space
has really taken
a national approach
on e?commerce.
The traditional way of
building trophies is crazy.
The assembly process
in our first year ??
Was a nightmare.
Assembly was more expensive
than cost of goods.
The way that we developed
our columns,
the assembly time
was cut down by 90%.
Now I get it.
You're a logistics guy.
Yeah.
Everybody else in this space
can't do what you do
because anybody else would
take years to get up to speed
to where you are.
Correct.
Yeah.
Okay, guys,
so I really respect people
who play sports.
People that are sports fans,
I kind of respect them.
Fantasy guys ?? whew.
[ Laughter ]
So, let me tell you
a story.
I was trying to date
this really hot woman.
I didn't realize she never
had a date on Sunday
'cause these morons were
so busy watching sports.
So, no matter where I was at
in the world,
I would make sure
that I got to New York on Sunday
to take out
this smoking hot woman.
And I remember her telling me,
you know,
"I really don't like guys
who like sports
'cause, you know,
I'm alone on Sundays."
And I said, "I will never watch
a sports game my entire life
if you marry me,"
and I'm married now.
That's awesome.
So...
I'm out.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.
Guys, look,
I'm going to make you an offer.
I'll give you $600,000
for 25%
of the business,
and my value is to try
and work it
into the corporate market,
which isn't that easy.
But wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What do you want the money for,
and what is it that you need?
We're looking for a strategic
partner, right?
We don't want to just continue
doubling every year.
We want to 10x.
Matt, what would
the strategic partner bring you?
So, whether it's opening up
the doors at arenas
for products
within the stadiums,
right,
commemorative rings.
Are you here
just for Cuban?
I think so.
No, we are not.
What do you want to do,
Mark?
What is Mark doing?
Cuban: So, guys, I mean,
I like what you're doing.
I like the fact
that you're hustlers, right,
and you're looking to touch
all the pieces
and you're just
following the money.
The question is,
8% isn't enough.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll offer you
the $600,000
but I want...17%.
Appreciate the offer.
Thank you very much.
And it's either a yes or no,
because ??
No, I'm going to
make you an offer.
There you go.
Then I'm out.
Whoa!
That was a fast
yes or no.
Corcoran: You didn't
even answer. That's unfair.
Shot clock. Shot clock.
Shot clock. Whoa.
Mark, they didn't even
answer her. That's not fair.
You might as well.
Cuban: Unless you want to
say yes, you know.
So it's your decision,
right?
So I'll tell you my offer.
I'll tell you my offer.
Let's take the deal.
Deal.
Done.
Let's go.
Holt: Deal.
Alright, Lori.
John: Aw. That was like
taking candy from a baby.
I had such
a good offer for you.
You should be
ashamed of yourself.
He put us on the spot
too hard.
You know what?
It's good to be the king.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, buddy!
[ Laughs ]
Dream since
the beginning, man.
I've been watching "Shark Tank"
since Season 1.
This is surreal.
We're partners
with Mark Cuban!
[ Both laugh ]
