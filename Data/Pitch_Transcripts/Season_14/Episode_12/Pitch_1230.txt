Hi, Sharks.
I'm Alicia.
And I'm her husband, Dane,
and we're from Columbus, Ohio.
Sharks, I've been making
plant-based milks
at home for years.
But let me tell you,
it's better
than the alternative --
store-bought milks.
Many plant-based milks in
store are filled with
preservatives,
gum fillers
and processed sugars.
Isn't that nuts?
We knew there had to be
a more sustainable
and easier way to make
plant-based milk at home.
And that's why
we created...
Nutr.        Nutr.
Our Nutr machine
can make plant-based milks
in minutes, all with just
a push of a button.
Simply add some nuts,
water and other ingredients
of your choice
into your Nutr machine,
and after a few minutes
of blending...
Voilà, here's your clean
and nutritious plant-based
milk.
Okay, Sharks, we know this may
sound a little nutty,
but we're asking
for $500,000.
In exchange
for 5% of Nutr.
Ooh.
Sharks...
Whoa! What the French toast?
...who's ready to change the
way we milk for a better
future?
Please check out the Nutr
machines for yourselves.
Daniel, why don't you come up
here and give it a try?
Okay.
Yeah.
And in front of you,
you'll also find plain
almond milk and oat milk,
as well as strawberry,
vanilla, chocolate, and
matcha,
all made with our proprietary
nut blends.
So...
And so we put in...
Yeah.
Put them in?
Absolutely.
Okay,
so I'm gonna put in...
Yep, put in one scoop.
Absolutely.
Whoa, this is good.
And then how much water?
The whole cup.
You can pour
the whole cup.
Okay, so we close it.
Yup, and then --
Greiner:
I tried every single one,
and they all taste
very pure and clean.
If you just push
one button.
Okay.
[ Whirring ]
And so you let it go?
Yes.
It stops by itself?
Stops by itself.
Dane: Correct.
Oh, it is very creamy.
Very creamy.
It was no -- So, Daniel,
how does it taste?
You know
what I love about this?
Is the store brands,
you're tasting sugar.
This you just taste purely
the cashews.
What do you sell these for?
And what does it cost you
to make them?
So, we make them
for $42 each.
And what do you
sell them for?
We sell them for $169.
So, you have a great margin.
Yeah, it's about
a 73% gross margin.
Are you selling -- Are you
selling it direct to consumer
or to retailer or both?
So mostly 90% of our sales
are through our website.
So, um, I noticed
in this box here
you have all these
different things
that make the drink flavors
we just tried.
Absolutely.
Correct.
Cuban: Tell us the numbers
there for your...
Nutr blends.
Yeah, so for biweekly
subscription,
is starting at $45
and a monthly is $75.
What?
Per month.
Greiner: Wait, wait.
Per month?
I can't stand the tension.
What are you --
What did you sell last year?
We finished a year
with $793,000 in sales.
Wow.
Was there a Kickstarter
involved or...
No.
Okay. What about this year?
What are you gonna do?
So far,
close to $2 million.
We are on track
for $6 million this year.
Cuban: Okay, so $2 million
so far this year.
Wow.
So, how did you do that?
Did you spend a lot of money
on advertising?
Or what did you do to build
community and drive your
sales?
Influencer marketing.
That's not -- not bad.
Cuban: And how much did you
spend on advertising,
promotion,
and influencer marketing?
Yeah,
so for the past 12 months,
we've done -- spent on
marketing for $1.3 million.
O'Leary: Whoa.
Did you raise any money?
No.
We bootstrapped.
We put in about
half a million dollars.
John: Yes, got it.
You're all -- You're all in.
Greiner: So here, you guys.
I'll tell you what I think.
I think that there are always
people that like another
gadget
that help to make their
morning coffee experience
something experiential
and better.
I have one of those things
that froth your milk,
but the problem with me
is I love it and I never use
it.
And so unfortunately,
I'm out.
Do you have any debt?
Do you have any debt or any
investors, outside investors?
We have
a creative financing.
So we did, you know,
it's a crowdfunding
platform for --
You said -- You guys
said you bootstrapped it.
And then you said you didn't
do any crowdfunding.
But, no, that's actually
a financing option.
The crowdfunding
is not Indiegogo.
It's a Kickfurther.
They'll only finance
your inventory.
Oh, 'cause crowdfunding
only for your inventory.
How much do you owe
in debt?
$1 million.
Oh.
No outside investors.
No.
No.
So we have
a soft circle
with about a quarter million
from angels, so we're looking
--
Cuban:
You can't be both.
You can't have $250,000
from angel investors
and say you bootstrapped.
Yeah,
you said you bootstrapped.
You said you didn't have
any debt.
Right, we own 100%
of the company.
Cuban: That's 'cause
it's convertible note.
Right.
John:
It's convertible, though.
Cuban: You probably know
I invested in Numilk, right?
And just personally --
Numilk is a big
commercial one, right?
And they have
a countertop one, too.
And so I like the product
a little better,
but I'm biased there.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Appreciate that.
If you come in here
and ask for $100,000
and I could have put the whole
Chef Wonderful thing behind it
and blown it up for you
and added to the social
and all that,
then it gets interesting.
But $500,000 -- I have to see
a path to liquidity times 10.
That's the problem
with this pitch.
Yeah, I understand that.
I'm out.
Yeah,
and I appreciate it.
How's that -- How's that 5%
thing working out right now?
Cuban: Yeah, you got Daniel
left and --
I'm still talking.
But I'm talking.
H-Here's what I think.
You're trying
to charge us
in what it will be
in the future today,
and the future
is your opinion.
You can make up
your own opinion,
but you cannot make up
your own facts.
We have to look
at the numbers today.
You're good people,
great product.
I'm out.
Okay, appreciate the feedback.
And then --
O'Leary: There's one Shark
left. Daniel.
Yeah. So since COVID started,
people really are conscious
about what
they're putting their body.
People want
to drink healthy,
and, really, people
are willing to pay a premium.
Lubetzky: Let me just first
start by telling you.
Yeah.
So I'll ask you
if you want to make me an
offer,
I will entertain it.
But I agree with Daymond
that you came in with an ask
that is very hard to reconcile
with the numbers.
Yep.
So, what is your
best offer?
Thank you, Daniel.
You are the entrepreneur
I've been admiring for years,
and so, um...
It's gonna be a yes
or no answer.
[ Indistinct whispering ]
Okay.
We'd be interested
in $500,000
for 7.5%,
plus 2% advisory share.
No, I -- I'm glad that
I asked it this way
because I would have offended
you with what I had in my
mind.
What do you have in mind?
I think I'm out,
but prove us wrong.
Okay.
Good luck.
Alicia: Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
Alicia: We gotta prove
to the Sharks that they're
wrong
because we're gonna
grow this to $1 billion,
and also we're gonna be in
every single coffee chain, so
--
and in every single household
in America.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a product made
with an ancient superfood.
