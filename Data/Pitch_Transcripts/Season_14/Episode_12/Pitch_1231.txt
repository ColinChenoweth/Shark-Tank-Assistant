My name is
Juan Ignacio Stewart.
I'm from Boulder, Colorado.
My company is called
Frescos Naturales.
How many calories
in a can, Juan?
You're having the -- the
Jamaica, that's the hibiscus.
Probably -- I think that one's
60, 60 calories in a can.
So, some have more sugar
than others.
So I add like 5 to 10 grams of
added sugar per -- per recipe,
more or less,
depends on which one.
Very good.
Mm.
I mean, they're --
they're almost fruit juicy
with a little bit
of carbonation.
This one, not so much.
Tell us about you.
I'm originally from Guatemala,
so that's where
these recipes come from.
They loved it.
Is that your son, Juan?
Yes.
Yeah, that's my boy, yeah.
Juan, this looks cool.
You would have to teach me
so much to help you
that I just don't think it's
something I can help you with.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Juan, I've seen so many
beverage pitches
on "Shark Tank"
in 14 years,
No problem.
Yeah, Juan,
I gotta give you credit.
Your presentation
was incredible,
but I hate this business.
W-Why? Why do you...
Because it's so hard
to sustain it.
There's a limited amount
of shelf space,
Juan,
you're mesmerizing.
Like, I could
listen to you for hours.
You're so pleasant
to listen to.
I'm free tonight
if you want to.
Beautiful energy.
[ Laughter ]
Let's go.
Cuban: You did it, Juan.
Yeah,
I admire all of you so much.
for Juan's <i>agua fresca</i>
company, Frescos Naturales,
but he wants a much bigger
slice of the business
than the 8%
Juan came in offering.
O'Leary: Wait a second.
Wait a second.
I'll do the deal with you.
I want 30%.
Greiner: Whoa!
15% each.
It's the only way
that happens.
Don't disrespect
yourself, Juan.
I do not have a beverage.
At 14 years,
I've never done a beverage
deal
'cause I hate the space.
But I love this guy.
If we get 30% for $130,000
I'll do the deal.
Um, you know,
I really appreciate that.
My mark right here is 20%...
No, not doing it.
...then I'm really ready
to work with you.
Sorry, Daniel,
not doing that.
10%, 10%?
Daniel, would you do it
for 20%?
10%'s not enough.
I-I-I can't.
I know what's involved.
My team has a lot of stuff
on their plate.
Juan...
Oh, here's the other part.
I should have brought
this up earlier.
I'm also looking for financing
for production.
Is that something that
you could -- you could help?
Don't do it, Juan.
...depending on you.
Don't do it, Juan.
[ Laughs ]
Congrats, Juan.
[ Conversing in Spanish ]
[ Laughter ]
Good luck, Juan.
Congrats.
See you at a Mavs game
soon.
Ooh.
Working with Daniel is
a massive opportunity for me.
