My name is
Juan Ignacio Stewart.
I'm from Boulder, Colorado.
My company is called
Frescos Naturales.
And I'm here looking
for $130,000 for 8% equity
in the business.
Now, Sharks,
Latin American food and
culture
are now part of the fabric
of this country.
Anybody ever hear
Taco Tuesday before?
[ Chuckles ]
But even though the food
culture has been embraced,
in the beverage space,
there are very few healthy
Latin American
drink alternatives
to high fructose corn syrup
or artificially flavored
sodas.
You may ask,
do they even exist?
And I would say <i>claro,</i>
of course they do.
If you go to the homes
of most immigrant
and Latinx families,
fresh at home with real
ingredients and low sugar.
Now, for those
that are unfamiliar,
we call these refreshing,
water-based drinks
Using recipes of growing up
back home in Guatemala,
I developed Frescos Naturales,
the first full line
We use just three ingredients,
one of those being water,
then the highest quality
fruits and flowers
and then just a little bit of
sugar to wrap them up good.
you've ever had in your life.
And we're innovating
in these traditional recipes
by adding light carbonation,
making them a perfectly
balanced fruit drink with
bubbles
in a can.
Now, Sharks,
I can't wait to build one
of the biggest, better-for-you
beverage brands in the world.
So, <i>Tiburones,</i> Sharks,
the opportunities are big
as the sea is deep.
So, how many of you are ready
to jump into the waters
of Frescos Naturales?
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary:
Let's -- Great pitch.
Greiner: It was very good.
It was poetic.
Let's try them, right?
Yes.
John: Alright, let's try it.
Sharks, in front of you,
we have three of our top
four selling flavors.
You have Maracuyá,
which is passion fruit.
The Rosa de Jamaica
is the dark red one.
That is hibiscus.
And the pink-colored can,
that's Guayaba. It's guava.
It's light.
Yes, you can smell
the fruit.
I mean, it's basically --
How many calories
in a can, Juan?
You're having the -- the
Jamaica, that's the hibiscus.
Probably -- I think that one's
60, 60 calories in a can.
So, some have more sugar
than others.
So I add like 5 to 10 grams of
added sugar per -- per recipe,
more or less,
depends on which one.
Very good.
Mm.
I mean, they're --
they're almost fruit juicy
with a little bit
of carbonation.
This one, not so much.
Tell us about you.
I'm originally from Guatemala,
so that's where
these recipes come from.
So I grew up drinking these,
and I moved here like 22 years
ago.
And now I make them at home
for my son, right?
For my family.
And it was actually his idea
to bottle these.
They loved it.
Is that your son, Juan?
Yes.
Yeah, that's my boy, yeah.
And he's working
the juice also?
No, no, he's not.
He's -- He's 19.
He's about to go to college.
This is actually
my second food company.
So, I-I made hot sauce
before.
I have a company that's
called Green Belly Foods
that's already distributed
across Colorado.
So Joaquin was
like, "Hey, pops,
you know what you should
bottle, is this stuff."
And that's when it clicked,
man, because Jamaica,
as you know,
every Latino that you know
in the United States
drinks this
and has had it
all their life.
Okay, it's a classic.
But you go to the store
and you don't find it.
So what's the game plan?
Do you have a co-packer?
How are you going
to get distribution?
Yeah.
So, great news.
We already got accepted
into Kroger.
-What?
-Wow!
-And this is --
How many stores?
Big.
They offered
four major retailers.
King Soopers in Colorado
is 130 stores
and Ralphs here in Southern
California, 230 stores.
Dang.
I'm really impressed.
So, have you started
shipping yet?
Yes, right.
So I started last year
at the beginning of the year
with just the Jamaica,
one flavor.
Basically, that first year,
I did $182,000 in sales.
That's right, man.
Wow.
Good for you.
Cuban: $182,000 in sales,
year one.
Yes.
Now get us to 2022.
Right. So we're at $100,000
right now
in six months, and it's low.
It's low.
We should be like $150,000.
For a company that's imputing
a $1.6 million valuation
Like the valuation's
implying
that you have half a million
to $1 million in sales.
So, tell us how you value
the company.
Right. Yeah, ba--
Basically, right now, I'm --
I'm looking at ending the year
at like $330,000 to $350,000
in sales this year.
We should get to $850,000
next year.
What does it cost to make it,
and what are you selling it
at?
Right.
It costs 88 cents per can.
I sell it
at $2.10 wholesale.
What is the retail cost
for the end consumer?
Right, so it -- it depends.
In some of these stores,
it's like --
they're selling it at
like $4.50.
$4.50 per can.
I want it to $2.99.
What is the average cost
of a competitor?
So the competitors
are like $3.99.
We're competing against
kombucha.
We're competing
against sparkling water.
What is a can
of sparkling water?
Probably cheaper than our
stuff, for sure.
But it doesn't have the
same flavor that people want.
Juan, this looks cool.
You would have to teach me
so much to help you
that I just don't think it's
something I can help you with.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Juan, I've seen so many
beverage pitches
on "Shark Tank"
in 14 years,
and getting market share
is impossible.
However, in your case,
what's remarkable
is that
this cultural niche
that you found
is really intriguing.
I do believe that there is
going to be a market for this,
but you haven't solved
the logistics.
However,
I'm gonna give you credit.
You're the first one ever
that I even thought about.
You're -- You're the best
pitch I've ever heard for a
beverage,
and I've always called them
all cockroaches 'cause they
were.
You're -- You're a cockroach,
too, but a really nice one.
Thank you.
I'm out.
No problem.
Yeah, Juan,
I gotta give you credit.
Your presentation
was incredible,
but I hate this business.
W-Why? Why do you...
Because it's so hard
to sustain it.
There's a limited amount
of shelf space,
and all of a sudden
they start asking
for slotting fees
or -- or advertising,
or we're gonna move you out
to somewhere else, right?
And so all of a sudden,
the investment needs
start ramping up.
I just don't like
this business.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
For me, I think that this is
very challenging
in that it's extremely
expensive...
True.
...and it's extremely
competitive.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
There was one more Shark,
though -- Daniel.
[ Speaks Spanish ]
So [speaks Spanish]
like, I want to take this
coast to coast in the U. S.
and I want to take it to
Mexico
and I want to take to Central
America where I-I --
We know there's already
consumers there wanting it.
Juan,
you're mesmerizing.
Like, I could
listen to you for hours.
You're so pleasant
to listen to.
I'm free tonight
if you want to.
Beautiful energy.
[ Laughter ]
Let's go.
Cuban: You did it, Juan.
Yeah,
I admire all of you so much.
And [speaks Spanish]
thank you.
It's a ton of work,
but I-I just love your energy
and your personality
and so much passion
and I want to invest.
But sometimes
entrepreneurs
don't realize how hard the
road is gonna be.
Well, no, when I launched
this, it was right before
the first diagnosis
of cancer for my son.
Yeah, it was rough.
You know, like, launching this
a-and pushing it
while also being --
going through all of that
was -- was the hardest thing.
Like -- Like, even dealing
with the shortage
of aluminum during COVID --
not a problem.
what Jamaica is --
not a problem.
Getting accounts,
making maps,
distributing, moving pallets
-- not a problem.
Cancer with my son,
that was something that, um,
yeah, that really shows you,
like -- like, there's things,
like, what matters
and -- and what is, you know,
people can wait
for the drinks.
Puts things in context.
So, he was 15. He's 19 now.
He just had scans this last
week, and they're all good.
[ Cheering ]
That's right.
So he's clean now three years.
We're looking for five to be
totally -- totally on the
clear.
But for me, like, the --
the drinks are a piece of
cake.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, um...
I'm sure you're gonna
figure this out
because both your energy
and your entrepreneurial
spirit
are very there,
it's very clear.
With your help?
This is not,
as it is today,
not an investable business,
but I'll say one thing.
To all the Sharks,
I am completely serious
about this.
This really is
on trend.
It is one
of the hardest spaces.
If you convince
one of the other Sharks,
I'll do this
because I believe in you.
We're all out, Daniel.
There's no one to convince.
This is exactly what I wanted.
O'Leary: Wait a second.
Wait a second.
I'll do the deal with you.
I want 30%.
Greiner: Whoa!
John: Whoa.
Ouch.
for Juan's <i>agua fresca</i>
company, Frescos Naturales,
but he wants a much bigger
slice of the business
than the 8%
Juan came in offering.
O'Leary: Wait a second.
Wait a second.
I'll do the deal with you.
I want 30%.
Greiner: Whoa!
15% each.
It's the only way
that happens.
Don't disrespect
yourself, Juan.
I do not have a beverage.
At 14 years,
I've never done a beverage
deal
'cause I hate the space.
But I love this guy.
If we get 30% for $130,000
I'll do the deal.
Um, you know,
I really appreciate that.
My mark right here is 20%...
No, not doing it.
...then I'm really ready
to work with you.
Sorry, Daniel,
not doing that.
10%, 10%?
Daniel, would you do it
for 20%?
10%'s not enough.
I-I-I can't.
I know what's involved.
My team has a lot of stuff
on their plate.
Juan...
Oh, here's the other part.
I should have brought
this up earlier.
I'm also looking for financing
for production.
Is that something that
you could -- you could help?
Don't do it, Juan.
...depending on you.
Don't do it, Juan.
[ Laughs ]
Congrats, Juan.
[ Conversing in Spanish ]
[ Laughter ]
Good luck, Juan.
Congrats.
See you at a Mavs game
soon.
Ooh.
Working with Daniel is
a massive opportunity for me.
I can learn so much from him,
and I'm looking forward to
that.
That's, like, the biggest --
the biggest part
'cause I've been -- I've been
doing this on my own, you
know,
and -- and -- and --
and -- and figuring it out
and just be like,
"Okay, what I have to do?"
But then working with him
and his team,
that's -- that's
a massive opportunity.
And I'm so grateful.
Lord.
I gotta call my mom.
[ Chuckles ]
I gotta call my dad,
my sister,
gotta call my son.
[ Exhales sharply ]
