My name is Aaron Gailmor,
and I'm from New Orleans
in case you couldn't tell.
I'm seeking $400,000 for 7%
of my company, Brass Roots.
Aaron,
I'm struggling here
because there's a lot of good
in what you're doing.
You project an enormous amount
of self-confidence.
I assume that behind it
there's the feelings
that all of us entrepreneurs
have
when we're facing
three months left of financing
and we're like sweating.
The silver lining
in the months ahead
that you're gonna face is that
there's nowhere to hide,
right?
So it's gonna
make you stronger
because every dollar
matters.
Mm-hmm.
I don't think this business
is investable
at this moment.
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Okay.
Alright, I appreciate that.
Good luck.
Good luck, man.
Thank you, guys.
Gailmor: I know Mr. Wonderful
said we're in a world of hurt.
I very much
disagree with that.
We've got such great
growth metrics right now.
People are coming to us
talking about how much
they love sacha inchi
and it's actually helping
and changing their lives.
So I'm -- I'm really excited
about our future.
