My name is Aaron Gailmor,
and I'm from New Orleans
in case you couldn't tell.
I'm seeking $400,000 for 7%
of my company, Brass Roots.
Aaron,
I'm struggling here
because there's a lot of good
in what you're doing.
You project an enormous amount
of self-confidence.
I assume that behind it
there's the feelings
that all of us entrepreneurs
have
when we're facing
three months left of financing
Gailmor: I know Mr. Wonderful
said we're in a world of hurt.
I very much
disagree with that.
We've got such great
growth metrics right now.
People are coming to us
talking about how much
they love sacha inchi
