So lotion is 70% water.
Sandra.
This -- no water.
I love what you just said.
I love you.
That is like
my pet peeve.
All these young people
that think they're helping
Okay. Sandra, there's nobody
in except me, alright?
Oh, Kevin. How did it come --
How did it get to this point?
Well, you know, I actually
am impressed with you,
but you're not
worth $6 million.
Sandra, I was going to make
you a very sharky offer,
Sandra has an offer
on the table from Kevin
for her cactus-based skincare
line Nopalera,
but he wants 30%
of the company,
a much bigger stake than the
5% she came in offering.
Right? My ancestors --
Sandra, you got two offers.
Oh, you do have two offers.
That's pretty impr--
You got two offers.
Yes.
You may not
like the valuation.
So what's your offer, Kevin?
I want -- I want to add one
other thing for you to
consider.
14 years of "Shark Tank."
I've invested
in so many different deals.
75% of my returns have come
from the companies run by
women.
So I'm very biased to invest
in strong women entrepreneurs.
That's what I've learned.
That's the truth.
I appreciate all of you,
really. I really do.
Sandra.
I really respect
all of you,
but my ancestors are
whispering in my ear
Velasquez: I walked away from
multiple Shark offers
