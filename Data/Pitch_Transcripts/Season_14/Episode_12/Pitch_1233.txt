So lotion is 70% water.
Sandra.
This -- no water.
I love what you just said.
I love you.
That is like
my pet peeve.
All these young people
that think they're helping
the environment
and they use...
Yeah. Yes, yes.
...shampoos and body washes
and it's all water,
but it's contained
in plastic bottle.
Exactly.
So you're just buying a bunch
of plastic bottles.
Yes.
What's your background?
I have been a musician
my entire life.
And I thought that that was
my purpose on Earth.
I used to be the lead singer
of a Latin alternative band
called Pistolero,
I sang in Spanish.
And so it seems like
a big jump to go
from a lead singer of a band
to running a beauty company.
But, really,
the mission is the same,
right?
I'm celebrating my culture.
I am making people feel seen,
making them feel proud.
Because I live in New York,
very expensive city,
I always had to
have a day job,
so I worked as a sales rep
for CPG brands,
but I found myself
unemployed at the age of 43
a couple of summers ago
with student loan debt,
credit card debt,
and a child to raise.
I knew that the only way
I was going to change my life
was to create something bigger
than I had ever actually
been a part of before.
The answer wasn't going to be
working for
yet another CPG brand that
wasn't going to pay me enough.
And so I started
to build this brand.
One of the things that I did
was invest in myself
by enrolling
in formulation school.
I said, why does this brand
not already exist?
Latinos are the largest
minority group in this
country,
and yet we have been
conditioned to aspire to
Eurocentric brands
with French and Italian names.
So what's driving me
is really I want to show
my community what is possible.
I don't want to aspire
to be like someone else.
We want to aspire
to be ourselves.
So it's not just for Latinas,
though. It's for everybody.
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you. Thank you.
What are your sales?
Okay. Okay, so sales.
So I launched in the middle
of the pandemic, November
2020.
That was $19,000.
Then 2021, which I consider
my first full year of
business,
$607,000 in sales.
Whoa. Okay.
Wow.
And then year to date,
so far, we are at $335,000.
How -- How are these sales?
Where are they coming from?
Like, D2C?
So our business is pretty
much 50/50 D2C, 50% wholesale.
And of the wholesale,
I did get into Nordstrom,
Credo Beauty,
Free People, and over
350 boutiques nationwide.
Cuban: Good for you.
Greiner: Wow.
I said bravo because I do
think, you know, from launch
to get to $600,000, $300,000
I think is very respectable.
But how do you impute
a $6 million
valuation on the business?
Yes.
That's very hard
to justify.
I have meetings booked with
the two top beauty retailers
in the next 30 days.
We are at that hockey stick
moment of our business.
Like,
the tidal wave is coming,
and, uh, we have
so much interest,
even from international
places, that we can't really
say yes to
because we're not set up
operationally.
John:
Here's my thought about this.
So, I have two
beautiful daughters
that are half Latina.
I-I-I love your mission.
Thank you.
I would have to ask
for so much
that it would compromise
the end of the day
why you started it.
Thank you.
I would ask for too much.
So with that, I'm out.
I so appreciate where you're
coming from. Thank you so
much.
Do you think you'll break
even, or you'll lose money
this year?
We should be profitable
by the end of this year
with the forecast that we
have. We're really --
What do you think
you'll make in profit then?
That's a great question.
I would have to look
at the forecast again, but --
Well, you should know
that number.
Yes, I should.
What is it?
What the --
What the cash profit is?
Yeah. I mean,
you're in the Shark Tank.
You better know your numbers
or I put you to hell.
Yes.
I know a lot
of different numbers, yes.
Well, it really --
We're really strong in Q4.
So when -- when holiday
season comes,
also Hispanic Heritage Month
is coming,
this is where we -- where
we're going to make, you know,
hit our revenue goals
is at the end of the year.
Greiner: Listen,
your mission is great.
Your intention,
your heart.
But it's a great business
for you,
but it's not investable
for me.
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.
Okay. Sandra, there's nobody
in except me, alright?
Oh, Kevin. How did it come --
How did it get to this point?
Well, you know, I actually
am impressed with you,
but you're not
worth $6 million.
You just aren't, and you don't
have enough infrastructure
yet to claim that.
However, I'll give you
the $300,000.
I want 30%.
Greiner: Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh.
I think -- I don't think
you're worth
much more than a million
bucks right now.
You could use the contacts
I have in retail,
and, you know,
QVC and all that stuff.
Sandra, I was going to make
you a very sharky offer,
but I decided not to,
I respect you.
And the last thing
I want you to know.
But if -- if you're gonna
consider offers like that,
then I'm gonna
make you an offer.
Sandra has an offer
on the table from Kevin
for her cactus-based skincare
line Nopalera,
but he wants 30%
of the company,
a much bigger stake than the
5% she came in offering.
And Daniel may have had
a change of heart.
If you're gonna consider
offers like that,
then I'm gonna
make you an offer.
From your numbers, the most I
could go is $300,000 for 25%.
As you all know, this is a
brand that is about self
-worth.
Right? My ancestors --
Sandra, you got two offers.
Oh, you do have two offers.
That's pretty impr--
You got two offers.
Yes.
You may not
like the valuation.
So what's your offer, Kevin?
I want -- I want to add one
other thing for you to
consider.
14 years of "Shark Tank."
I've invested
in so many different deals.
75% of my returns have come
from the companies run by
women.
So I'm very biased to invest
in strong women entrepreneurs.
That's what I've learned.
That's the truth.
And it --
it really works.
My offer
is $300,000 for 30%,
and Daniel's a discount Shark,
so he wants to do it for 25%.
So, definitely
I-I cannot go to 25%, Daniel.
We are in
the middle of a race.
I understand
where you're coming from.
I am a young brand.
What is your counter
to either of us?
It's -- It's 10% for --
for -- for $600,000.
Wow.
This is --
I'm sorry.
You said 10% for $600,000?
Yes, it's -- it's the $300,000
for 5%.
That is the same exact thing
you came in with.
That's right. That's right.
Greiner: That's right.
Maybe she feels like --
John: That's not --
That's not a negotiation.
That's -- That's
"I came here for this or not."
Cuban: You're allowed to be
proud of your company.
You are allowed to be.
You have no --
Alright, alright.
Here's how the show goes.
You know,
don't let them shame you
into that you came in with
the wrong valuation.
No, but, Lori, I --
Lori, let's be clear.
Lubetzky:
No, it's totally fair.
I mean, there's no wiggle room
at all?
Sometimes, maybe not.
No, because, Daymond,
what's going on
is she has the two largest
beauty retailers
coming in front of her
and she has a feeling
of where she's headed.
I'm not questioning
whether she has merit or not,
but here's how
the show goes.
[ Laughs ] You gotta
negotiate a little bit.
You come in,
there's a number,
and you're willing
to negotiate.
What she just basically said
is, no, there is no
negotiation.
I appreciate all of you,
really. I really do.
Sandra.
I really respect
all of you,
but my ancestors are
whispering in my ear
Don't undervalue yourself.
And you're right.
Always listen to your God
and to your ancestors.
We wish you the best.
We'll buy the product.
I'm out.
Thank you so much.
Okay, I'm out.
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
Bye, everyone.
Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you.
Have a great day.
Great job. Great job.
Greiner: Good luck.
Congratulations.
Hell, yeah.
Good for her.
Velasquez: I walked away from
multiple Shark offers
because I had a ceiling in
mind, and I just didn't want
to budge.
But just like the nopal,
which is resilient and
ancient,
has always been here
and always will be, so will
we.
And the future is bright
for Nopalera.
No wiggle room's crazy.
That's a first.
You negotiate.
This show is based on
negotiation.
Yep.
Yeah, but for her,
it was all about self-worth
and she stuck to it.
