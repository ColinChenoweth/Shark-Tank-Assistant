I'm Max Brown,
also from Buffalo, New York.
We're seeking $250,000
for 10% of our company.
Sharks, there
are three well-known problems
that need to be fixed
when it comes to
the 9:00-to-5:00
work life.
One, it's too boring.
Two, with all the constant
push notifications,
You should certainly.
Brown: You should check it out.
Ah.
If it's six years old,
hit us with a little sales.
Sure, so we've done over
$1.6 million in lifetime sales.
What?!
Yeah, but --
$400,000 in net income.
Say what?!
What did you do
last year?
Last year
was $540,000 in sales.
Net income last 12 months
was $123,000.
I got to tell you,
it's more than I-I thought.
Greiner: When was the "aha"
moment you're just sitting there
going, "Oh, Banana Phone"?
In 2016, I was sitting
Brown: Do you remember
that, Barbara?
But that's a very broad net --
Tell us what it costs
But, Max, just to be clear,
it's not a phone.
You need to pair it
with a phone.
Brunsing: That's correct.
You just pair
your banana to your Apple.
Oh, thank you, Robert.
Herjavec: Got it, got it.
Guys, let me ask you this.
You did $540,000 last year.
Your total lifetime sales over
six years were $1.2 million.
What shifted to get
your sales to go boom?
In the last two years,
we've shifted to a robust
direct-to-consumer
advertising strategy,
leveraging Facebook,
Instagram, TikTok, Google.
It sounds
very expensive.
How much are you
spending on that?
We're spending
$9 per customer.
Is that your customer
acquisition, is 9 bucks?
That's actually
not that bad.
Brown: Thank you all.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you all.
Bye.
