Hi, Sharks.
My name is Braxton Fleming,
and I'm from
Mays Landing, New Jersey.
And I'm seeking $200,000
in exchange for 15% equity
of my company.
Six years ago, the trajectory
of my whole life changed.
I realized...
I was transgender.
With this realization
came with a lifelong commitment
of taking
hormone replacement therapy
in the form of injections.
During my first year
of transitioning,
there was nowhere
to properly store
my medical needs in a safe,
neat, discreet, yet stylish way.
That's where Stealth Bros &amp; Co.
revolutionized the way
that we store our meds
and dispose of our sharps.
This was born out of my own need
as a trans man,
but I realized there were
multiple underrepresented
medical communities
who needed this product.
Who do you know
that's a diabetic?
Or maybe you know someone going
through infertility treatment,
a child with injectable needs,
or even cisgendered individuals
going through hormone
replacement therapy.
All of these underrepresented
medical communities
need options to travel
with confidence
for easy and proper
at-home storage.
That's where our Dopp kits
and Stealth sharp shuttles
come in and save the day.
It's time to upgrade
your plastic bags -- whew --
and your old jugs
and store your meds in luxury.
So, Sharks, who wants to fill
the void of millions of people
and take a shot
with Stealth Bros &amp; Co.?
Let's go!
[ Laughter ]
Cuban: Yeah.
Yes.
So we can have a look
at this here?
Absolutely.
Please open up your bags and
take a look at what you have.
Herjavec: What do we
have in front of us, Braxton?
Okay, so what you have
in front of you
is a junior Dopp kit and
a stealth sharp shuttle inside.
So the junior Dopp kit
that you have is
our foundational
junior Dopp kit,
which is in line
with our sword interior.
And then, Lori,
you have our premium Dopp kit,
which is made
with our vegan faux leather.
So your medicines
and everything can go in here?
The vials?
Yes, that is
for the vials.
What's a sharp?
So a sharps is part of
your injectable needs.
It's a needle?
It's a biohazard container.
Absolutely.
To put your needle it.
Absolutely.
Well, after I use the needle,
I put it in here?
Yes. So you just pop this top
open like this.
And then it can close.
And you can open it
and close it multiple times.
Once it's filled,
then you want to take
that little latch at the top,
stick it in that compartment,
and then it locks permanently,
and then you can
discard it appropriately.
So this is the disposable
aspect of the needles.
Yes.
But does only one
come with your kit?
I would think you'd be
using these like crazy.
So, yes, we actually
offer them in bundles.
So you could buy it for one,
three, or five on my website.
And we just received
a major purchase order
from a large retailer,
and they will be sold
in a bundle pack of four.
There are other Dopp kits
for injectables, right?
'Cause I've seen
plenty of them.
Yes.
And so you just
made them more fashionable
and more fashion looking?
Correct.
And same with the sharps.
Absolutely.
Okay.
What was missing
from the other kits?
And is it
what Mark said?
Right, right.
You just made it
more fashionable and cool?
What was missing was
the effect that it was daunting
to take the injection
for me.
Even though I'm a nurse,
I've been a nurse
for the past 11 years,
I realized that, yes,
I give injections every day,
but when I was watching
the YouTube videos online
of my community
taking these injections,
I was realizing how much anxiety
was bri-- it was bringing them.
Sure.
And once I created something
that organized
everything for them,
they weren't all over the place.
I want to bring an experience
to the user.
I want them to feel good
about themselves.
And this brings happiness
to my community,
and that's what
I'm trying to do here.
How do you reach your community?
How do you sell the product?
So I sell the product
all through e-commerce,
and I've just been growing
organically through influencer.
And now would be
a good time to ask you,
how much
have you sold?
Year to date, currently,
we're at $110,000.
That's good.
Herjavec: And last year,
what did you do,
Braxton?
We did $147,000.
So we're up 40%
currently right now.
What does this cost to make,
and what do you sell it for?
Okay, so the one that you have
costs $5.80 for me,
and then I sell it
for $34.
$34?
Greiner:
That's a big margin.
On the sharp stuff, what
your cost is for one of these?
Fleming: Okay.
And what you're gonna sell
the one, three, and four pack,
I guess.
Okay, so if we buy over
10,000 pieces of that,
it's at 28 cents,
and then we sell them
for $4 on the website.
And then if you buy
a pack of five, it's $15.
And what are you gonna
sell it for wholesale
to the retailer?
So I sell it
to them for $7.50,
and then they're reselling it
for $14.99.
So $7.50 for a pack of four.
And it cost you 28 cents?
Yes. Thank you.
Herjavec: Mark's gonna
start selling them.
Braxton, can you tell us
a little bit about
yourself
and your background?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
So I actually come from
two entrepreneurial parents,
and as I was growing up,
I was very accepted
in my family.
You know, my parents loved me.
They never judged me.
They let me be
whoever I wanted to be.
And at the age of
27 years old, I said,
"Something is missing
from my life."
And that's when I realized
that I was transgender.
And once I made that change,
as I was watching
YouTube videos of other
trans men taking
hormone replacement injections,
that's how I realized
that there was
a need for this.
And I was indirectly
assessing them
with my nursing skills, saying,
"Oh, that's not safe."
Like, they're putting it
in shoe boxes,
they're putting it
in plastic bags.
And that's when I said,
"You know, I really want
to become a part of my community
because they've given me so much
that I wanted to give back."
I created this brand,
and it just blew up.
Is it just you
running the business?
It's all me.
I do everything.
I literally work out
of my basement right now.
I have all my product
down there.
Are you still doing this
completely out of your basement?
Yes. 100%.
And are you nursing
still, or...?
Yes, I've actually been trying
to slow down
because I've been putting
more effort into the business.
I'm just curious,
the logo,
Stealth Bros and Co.
Yes.
When you came out here,
I thought --
Cuban: It's a great name now.
Now that we know
and understand it, it's great.
I'll explain the name.
Stealth is because
I wanted people to be able
to keep their
medication discreet.
No, I get
the stealth part.
Why the Bros and Co.
and the swords?
And Bros is, we're built
on the foundation
of the brotherhood of F-to-M --
female to male brotherhood.
I see.
And then "&amp; Co."
is &amp; communities
that we keep,
our allied communities.
That's great.
And then the swords
are there for because
iron sharpens iron,
and more than one community
coming together
makes you better and stronger,
and that what --
Do you have that up on your
website, the explanation?
I actually do not.
You should. It's cool.
I should. Thank you.
You should.
That's very cool.
And there should be
a video there
of you explaining it
because the power
of how you
just explained it...
Yes.
Yeah.
...that comes across
very, very well.
Thank you.
I think that it's kind of
the -- the perfect kit,
and I love what you're doing
for the community.
I don't think
you need a partner.
I don't always say that.
I rarely say it.
I think
you should run this.
I think you should take
all the profit.
And I think you should
grow step by step.
And you're gonna have
a wonderful business
and reap what you sow.
And for those reasons, I wish
you good luck, but I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.
So, Braxton, the greatest
part of your business,
not to diminish the other
parts of your business,
is really you.
Thank you.
I mean, you exude
an incredible warmth.
Thank you.
And personality
that draws people to you.
Thank you.
I think you've got
a good business.
Just at the size
you are right now,
just not something
for me.
I'm out.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Corcoran: I've had some
personal experience.
When I was trying
to get pregnant,
I was doing in-vitro
for seven years
to give birth to
my first born.
Wow.
Thank God it worked.
Wow.
God bless you.
I remember being
in business meetings,
in museums...
Yes.
...in theaters where
it's time to take my big shot.
Right.
It was just as big as this.
Yeah.
With a big plunger.
And it was made of oil
that burned when it went in.
That's right.
It was horrible.
Yeah.
But the ingenious ways
I had to come up with
just to hide that.
Not that I was ashamed,
but what do you do with
the damn needle?
Right, right.
You know, my life had to go on.
I used to carry
books with me,
cut out pages in the middle,
cut a page, like a spot.
Wow.
And carry the book
and stick
the needles in there.
Because you can't dispose
in a restroom.
You can't throw it
in a garbage can.
But let me
tell you something.
You have genuine warmth
and love
that your pitch
comes from.
Thank you.
You feel it all over.
And you know what?
I'm a believer,
if you're that sincere...
Yes.
...and you come from
that love spot...
Yes.
...people always do well.
And they buy. They just buy.
It's like a magic wand.
And I think it's terrific
what you do.
Thank you so much, Barbara.
Thank you.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
in Braxton's medical Dopp kit
company Stealth Bros &amp; Co.
Corcoran: I think
it's terrific what you do.
Thank you so much, Barbara.
Thank you.
I'm gonna make you
an offer...
Okay.
...of $200,000, but I don't want
to put in all cash.
I'm gonna give you
$100,000 in a credit line,
$100,000 cash.
Okay.
And I do want 20%
of the business
'cause I want to feel happy
when you do well and make money.
So I'd like to be part
of that celebration with you.
Yes.
Yeah.
I-I think it has merit.
I think you
have made something
much more fashionable
and interesting to own.
I get it.
Barbara, do you want
any help?
Or you want to
do it yourself?
You want to jump in?
I think it's a good cause.
Yeah, I'll split it with you
if you want.
Yeah. Okay.
I like the fact
you know your numbers.
Right.
But it's not a product
that's gonna fit for me.
Okay.
But I wish you the best.
You're a good guy.
The presentation was very good.
Thank you, Kevin.
I'm out, but you do have
an offer from a Sharkette.
And Mark is still,
I believe.
No, I'm -- I'm very interested,
and Barb and I were talking.
From an operational
perspective,
it's not just
a cash issue.
It's building your
business issue, as well.
Yes, it is.
Because you're
doing it yourself,
trying to scale it from
the basement to a business...
Correct.
...is going to be
a lot of work,
and I think between
our two organizations,
we -- we can complement each
other to get you there.
Absolutely.
And so if it works with you,
Barb and I will split it.
So it's going to be $200,000,
$100,000 of that in cash,
and $100,000 of that
as a line of credit for 20%.
What do you think,
Braxton?
Wow. That's amazing.
What do you think?
Um...
It wouldn't be right
if I didn't counter.
So, are you guys willing
to go to 18%?
Well...
You guys got a deal.
-You got it.
-Oh, yes!
Congratulations!
Thank you so much.
It's such a pleasure, Mark.
Thank you so much.
Congratulations.
Appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Barbara.
My pleasure.
Congrats.
Thank you so much, everybody.
Cuban: Congrats.
Thank you.
This was a pleasure.
Fleming: I'm so excited.
I-I cannot believe that
I just secured a deal
with Mark and Barbara.
I'm just like...
Oh, my God. I just...
I prayed so hard for this.
