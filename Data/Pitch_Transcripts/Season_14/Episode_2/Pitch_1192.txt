I'm Max Brown,
also from Buffalo, New York.
We're seeking $250,000
for 10% of our company.
Sharks, there
are three well-known problems
that need to be fixed
when it comes to
the 9:00-to-5:00
work life.
One, it's too boring.
Two, with all the constant
push notifications,
e-mails,
and text messages,
establishing real human
connection is almost impossible.
And three,
and this one's universal...
There's just not enough
fun in the world.
And that's bananas.
That's why we created...
Banana Phone!    Banana Phone!
[ Laughs ]
Banana Phone is
a banana-shaped
Bluetooth handset
that connects
to your smartphone.
So you can talk to
your friends, family,
or the IRS
on a banana.
We like to think of it
as a phone with appeal.
Baked into this
delicious design
is everything you need
to spark real conversations.
Once paired
with your smartphone,
this robust banana
is ready to receive calls
at the push of a button.
Yellow?
Or you can initiate calls
by clicking
the multifunction button
twice and saying,
"Call the banana man."
Voice: Calling Mark Cuban.
[ Greiner laughs ]
You can also show off
your wild side
by bumping your
favorite tunes
by using your Banana Phone
as a speaker.
And we banana split
a portion of our proceeds
with the gorilla conservation
Gearing Up For Gorillas.
It's potassium with a purpose.
What can we say?
Talk more, smile more,
save gorillas.
And help us make
talking cool again with...
Banana Phone!     Banana Phone!
Ta-dum!
What did you guys do before
you got into the bananas?
I worked for Visa,
and this is a project
that I've been investing
tons of late nights,
weekends, and round-the-clock
work to support.
So this is a side hustle.
This is a side hustle,
correct.
Got it.
By day, I'm president
of Garrett Leather.
We're the world's largest
Italian upholstery
leather supplier.
How long have you
been in business?
We've been in business
for six years.
-Six years?
-Six years?!
[ Laughter ]
Yes.
Do we have
a Banana Phone in here?
You should certainly.
Brown: You should check it out.
Ah.
If it's six years old,
hit us with a little sales.
Sure, so we've done over
$1.6 million in lifetime sales.
What?!
Yeah, but --
$400,000 in net income.
Say what?!
What did you do
last year?
Last year
was $540,000 in sales.
Net income last 12 months
was $123,000.
I got to tell you,
it's more than I-I thought.
Greiner: When was the "aha"
moment you're just sitting there
going, "Oh, Banana Phone"?
In 2016, I was sitting
at my desk with
a banana in my hand,
trying to blow off a colleague,
saying, "I'm really busy."
And I said,
"Oh, my God, this has to exist."
[ Laughter ]
After a quick
Google search --
You know there's
a lot of people --
After a quick Google search,
I realized that it didn't.
And after a quick
Instagram search,
I realized that there were
45,000 other people
who were making that joke
at the same time.
Wow. Smart thinking.
And there's a Shark
in this room who's made
that joke, as well.
Oh, Barb.
Corcoran: Oh, yeah,
I use it all the time.
Brown: Do you remember
that, Barbara?
But that's a very broad net --
Tell us what it costs
if I want to buy it online and
what it costs you to land it.
So this nanner
costs $39.99 retail.
Oh!
That's a big banana!
Our landed cost is
$6 a unit.
Do you have a patent?
We did not pursue
a design patent...
What?
Shocking.
...because they're notoriously
easy to copy and to knock off.
So we pursued a trademark
to protect our brand.
But, Max, just to be clear,
it's not a phone.
You need to pair it
with a phone.
Brunsing: That's correct.
You just pair
your banana to your Apple.
Oh, thank you, Robert.
Herjavec: Got it, got it.
Guys, let me ask you this.
You did $540,000 last year.
Your total lifetime sales over
six years were $1.2 million.
What shifted to get
your sales to go boom?
In the last two years,
we've shifted to a robust
direct-to-consumer
advertising strategy,
leveraging Facebook,
Instagram, TikTok, Google.
It sounds
very expensive.
How much are you
spending on that?
We're spending
$9 per customer.
Is that your customer
acquisition, is 9 bucks?
That's actually
not that bad.
And what we are seeing
is that we hit people
with targeted advertising
for high impulse conversions,
and then when they
get the phone,
there's a virality to it because
they're posting on social media.
But nobody's full time
on this business.
Right.
Correct. Not right now.
Are you willing
to give up your careers
to support the banana?
That's the question.
If we have a strategic partner
who's willing to work
with us and leverage it,
absolutely.
Tell me what you're gonna
do with the $250,000.
The next horizon for us
is getting into
brick and mortar retail.
Oh.
Ugh!
I think that
this thing screams to be
in the "beyond" section
at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Ugh.
Guys, you know,
I think what you're trying to do
in retail is beyond insane.
I'm sorry.
It's not gonna work.
This is
a very eclectic category.
I do not need a Banana Phone
in my portfolio.
This is not a product for me.
I'm out.
You guys took a fruit and turned
it into money in your pocket.
Giving you $250,000 means
you've got to make $2.5 million
in profits for me
just to get my money back.
It's a great personal business,
but it's not a great fit for me.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you so much
for your consideration, Mark.
But congrats.
We really appreciate it.
Congratulations.
So many people have the idea,
but nobody ever puts it in play.
I'm just thinking of waking up
one day and saying,
"I'm in the banana phone
business,"
and I'm not sure I see
a scalable business
for an investor.
I'm out.
I'm not really an investor in
kitschy, like, novelty products
that much because I think
that they have
a spike and then a fall.
It's not really
the right product for me.
So I'm sorry. I'm out.
You know, I just object
to investing in your business
for one reason only,
which is I don't want you
working on this part time.
One half and one half
doesn't equal three.
Yeah.
All right?
It will not grow
if you do that.
It doesn't make sense,
so I'm out.
Thank you for
your consideration.
Thank you, guys.
Cuban: Good luck, guys.
Brown: Thank you all.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you all.
Bye.
