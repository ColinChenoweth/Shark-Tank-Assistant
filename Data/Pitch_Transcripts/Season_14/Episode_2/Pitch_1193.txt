Adrian: We know our valuation
is very low.
Low?
It's low because --
Yeah.
It's very low because
we are here to make a deal.
We can learn so much from this
group of people in this room,
Justine:
Exactly, yep.
I like this deal, okay?
'Cause it has something
I love called cash flow.
What does it have?
I love cash flow.
Justine: Exactly.
That's our mission.
We want to spread that joy
Justine: Yes.
Oh.
I'd love to be involved.
So we're gonna give you
$450,000 for 6%.
The two of us together.
Cuban: There we go.
There's the answer.
That's a nasty move.
The two of us together.
Adrian:
Can we take a moment?
You can, you can.
Yes, yes.
What do you think?
[ Whispering

Adrian: Thank you.
Justine: Thank you.
Oh, my God, you guys,
it's so good.
You guys are great.
Thank you so much.
My God, he threw me
under the bus!
You guys are as sharky
as we are. Congrats.
Greiner: Yeah, yeah.
Oh, they're very sharky.
Greiner:
Good job, you guys.
Are we skipping?
Sure, yeah.
Skip out. [ Laughs ]
