Hey, Sharks. We're Justine.
And Adrian.
The wife and husband team
behind The Woobles.
Today we're seeking
a $250,000 investment
in exchange for a 5% equity
in our company.
-[ Chuckles ]
-Wow.
Sharks, we're here
to get you hooked.
On crochet.
Our company is
The Woobles.
We make fun, simple kits
that teach you how to crochet.
But instead of
a boring potholder,
you'll learn how to make
adorable characters like...
Pierre the penguin
and Felix the fox.
Fred the dino
and Sebastian the lion.
Each kit comes with
step-by-step videos
that teach complete beginners
how to crochet.
Our secret -- we're not just
a crochet company.
We see ourselves
as an education company, too.
We've seen that something
magical happens
when people
learn a new skill.
It's about confidence.
So, Sharks, who is ready
to Wooble with us?
[ Laughter ]
Super cute.
Thank you.
Super cute.
What you have in front
of you is both a kit
and an example of
The Wooble
that you would make
with this kit.
And if you open up
the pouch,
then you'll see
our easy peasy yarn.
And then, most importantly,
there's a card inside
of the pouch that has
a link and a QR code
that brings you
to our website tutorial
our customers will follow to
learn how to make that Wooble.
What is the age
start for this?
So most people will look
at our product
and think that it's for kids,
but most of our customers
are actually adults
buying it for themselves.
And what do you sell
these for,
and what do they cost
you to make?
Landed, they're $3.
We wholesale for $15,
and we retail for $30.
Wow.
Herjavec: How do you sell them?
Over 90% of our sales
are direct to consumer,
straight from our website.
Wow.
Corcoran: So what made you
crochet in the first place?
Before I started
The Woobles,
I used to lead user experience
for Google Classroom.
Oh, really?
And I spent the bulk
of my career
as a UX designer
working on education products.
And I loved my job.
I was great at it.
I was so great that
they made me a manager,
and it turns out
I sucked at being a manager.
[ Laughter ]
And so to take
my mind off of work,
I started dabbling in
all these other hobbies,
and crochet was
one of those things.
And learning to crochet
reminded me that I still
have it in me to
learn something new,
that I could try to become
a better manager.
And so that experience
of really building
back my confidence
through crochet
is why we started this.
I want to share that
experience.
Are you still at Google?
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a 100% full time.
Is it full time
for both of you?
Yes.
Yes.
And what's your
background?
From a really young age,
I've been taught that success
means getting good grades,
going to a good school,
and getting
a really high-paying job.
And that's
exactly what I did.
So I became one of the youngest
directors on Wall Street.
I traded billions of dollars
in equities.
Wow.
But I wasn't any happier
at the end of it
than when I started.
And what I began to realize
was that I had spent
all that time working
towards someone else's
definition of success.
And so I left it
all behind to go
and try and figure out what
my own definition of success is.
I knew from
a really young age
that I really liked
helping people,
and then when we started
thinking about crochet kits,
what's really neat about it
is that it is that
confidence boost.
Sometimes as we get older,
you kind of stop
learning new things,
you start saying things like,
"You know,
I'm too old to learn that."
And so what brings me joy
with these kits
is that they're
a little confidence boost
to remind you that you can
always learn something new.
So exactly two years ago,
we started this business.
We took $200,
we bought some yarn,
and we bought
a domain name.
And since then,
we've done $5.3 million.
-Wow!
-Son of a gun!
-What?!
Cuban: Good for you.
What?!
That's incredible.
What are you gonna do --
Yeah, so year to date,
we've done $3.1 million.
And if we assume
that we just stop growing
from this point on out,
we'll do $7 million this year.
Cuban: You're dir--
Okay, you're direct to consumer,
which means you're doing
a lot of online advertising.
So tell us what your cost
to acquire these revenues are,
what your
gross margins are,
and what your
net margins are.
Yeah, so we spend about 20%
of our revenue on advertising.
Okay, that's not bad.
It costs us a blended CAC
of $16.
The average order value
is around $57.
Okay.
Wow. And they order one a kit
or more than one kit?
So that's about two kits.
Then you're making
a lot of money.
So 86% gross margin,
32% net margin lifetime,
and 38% year to date.
Great margins.
So why do you need $250,000?
I mean, you're killing it.
We're here
for three reasons.
We're here for licensing,
wholesale, and mentorship.
When it comes to licensing,
when a customer
finishes the kit,
the first thing they think is,
"I need to get another kit."
And then
they start asking us,
"Where's Baby Yoda? Do you have
any Disney characters?
Where are
the Marvel characters at?"
Guys, how did you arrive
at your valuation
that you presented?
Adrian: We know our valuation
is very low.
Low?
It's low because --
Yeah.
It's very low because
we are here to make a deal.
We can learn so much from this
group of people in this room,
and the way we see it,
we have two huge opportunities
ahead of us.
We haven't even begun
to talk about wholesale,
but licensing and wholesale
we think can drive this brand
to the next level.
You want to
go to retail?
We want to go to retail.
Why
when you're killing it?
'Cause they have enough
margin. Yeah.
We've -- We've done
a test order.
So now we get a little
more about what -- what
the mission really is.
Is the basis or the mechanism
for that learning,
in your vision,
always gonna be crochet?
Meaning is the next product
that you have coming,
a non-crochet
or some other form?
Yes, the -- the key
to our business
is the "learn to" part.
What we apply it to
can change.
But right now, we are 100%
focused on crochet.
So for the foreseeable future,
it's crochet kits.
Justine:
Exactly, yep.
I like this deal, okay?
'Cause it has something
I love called cash flow.
What does it have?
I love cash flow.
And so, I see
it this way.
I think I can reduce your costs
of acquiring customers
by around 8% to 10%.
Number two, I can definitely
help with licensing.
Been there, done that
with lots and lots of brands.
I also think I can help you with
some other interesting ideas
in the fashion world
with this stuff, okay?
The fashion world?
This I can't wait
to hear.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Listen.
This is a far stretch.
Do you want to hear
the offer or not?
-We would love to.
-This is scary.
I'll you the $250,000
for 10% equity.
Coming from you,
Mr. Wonderful,
I expected to
hear the word "loyalty."
You know why? You know why?
You have cash flow.
Would it be okay
if we just heard
if any of the other Sharks
are interested, as well?
Corcoran:
I would definitely.
I'll give you $300,000
for the same 10%.
Thank you.
Greiner: I love this.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I'm gonna go
$300,000 for 10%.
I-I understand
all of this.
I mean, I've been in this
market so much,
and I know how to get all
the things you talked about
from the licensing
to the retail stores.
I think you should be
everywhere and fast
because you are something
that could really take off.
Justine: Exactly.
That's our mission.
We want to spread that joy
and confidence
of learning something new.
I'm gonna give you
$350,000 for 10%.
Cuban: No!
$300,000 for 8%.
O'Leary: Okay, and --
It's 8%.
This mentoring
is gonna be worth it.
Guys, you understand
all the offers, right?
You got to make a decision.
Hold it a second.
Just hold it a second.
Kevin, and Lori for Adrian
and Justine's highly profitable
crochet kit business,
The Woobles.
I'm gonna give you
the $350,000 for 5%.
That's how much I believe
in your business.
You are sitting
on a rocket,
but you have to let me know
right away
'cause I'm being a fool here
bidding against myself.
Would you consider adding
another Shark to your offer?
I'll do it with Mark.
Come on, Mark. Come in with me.
Yeah.
I was $300,000 for 8%.
You don't need --
I can do this all alone.
We've read your book,
and we know --
we've seen what you've
been able to do.
I think that if you would
team up with another Shark...
What was the amount
you gave out?
$350,000.
The $350,000 for 6%.
Robert, are you gonna
do anything here?
Well, I'm trying to get
a word in here.
[ Laughter ]
I mean, it's hard.
I'm just seeing, how
can I get a piece of this?
Do you want Robert in it?
Make an offer.
Make an offer.
Justine: Yes.
Oh.
I'd love to be involved.
So we're gonna give you
$450,000 for 6%.
The two of us together.
Cuban: There we go.
There's the answer.
That's a nasty move.
The two of us together.
Guys, you understand
all the offers, right?
You got to make
a decision.
Adrian:
Can we take a moment?
You can, you can.
Yes, yes.
What do you think?
[ Whispering
indistinctly ]
I'm not sure.
Let's just --
Let's just try.
Okay, so...
each Shark offers
a lot of different value
in different areas, and where
we think in the short term
that we can really get
the most help
is with Mark and Lori.
I feel offended.
And with Barbara --
But I want to let
you know that, like,
you mean so much to me, but --
but for the company, I think --
Oh, how sweet.
Lori, do you want
to work together?
But let me tell you --
Wait, you're gonna
abandon me like that?
Yes, it's over.
That's what they want to do.
$450,000, 6%?
You guys got a deal.
Oh, I've had it now!
Done? Yes?
Herjavec: Wow.
Deal. We'd love to work
with you guys.
Congratulations.
Adrian: Thank you.
Justine: Thank you.
Oh, my God, you guys,
it's so good.
You guys are great.
Thank you so much.
My God, he threw me
under the bus!
You guys are as sharky
as we are. Congrats.
Greiner: Yeah, yeah.
Oh, they're very sharky.
Greiner:
Good job, you guys.
Are we skipping?
Sure, yeah.
Skip out. [ Laughs ]
Mark and Lori
were our target Sharks.
We did not prepare for
that scenario at all,
and we're just glad
it worked out.
It was definitely a risky move
to try to break up
Barbara and Mark and get Lori
in there instead.
And we're glad
that it worked out.
Mark, I brought you
into the deal.
You didn't even want the deal.
I was pushing you for the deal.
You were my partner.
I never for a moment
thought you would
throw me under the bus
and go with Lori.
I really feel like
the scorned woman.
Herjavec:
See, I -- Barbara.
Robert knew.
Barbara,
that's the difference.
I knew Lori would
throw me under the bus.
[ Laughter ]
Narrator: In Season 6, we
watched Brad, Aimy, and Justin
make a deal with Mark Cuban
for their wine-based party punch
BeatBox Beverages.
Brad: BeatBox is
a party in a box.
It's almost seven bottles of
wine packed into every box.
Narrator: Let's see what
they're up to now.
When we went on "Shark Tank",
we were doing about $235,000
in sales with our 5-liter
bag-in-box party punch.
In the first year
after "Shark Tank",
our sales grew
to $750,000.
Then over the next two years,
sales kind of flatlined.
We launched in almost 400
Walmarts, and, uh, we failed.
It didn't work.
We couldn't sell it through.
The 5-liter bag-in-box
was a huge serving size,
and to ask consumers
to spend $20 is a big challenge.
That's when we decided to create
the single-serve Tetra Pak.
By doing the single-serve,
we lowered the price point
to under $5,
and when we did that,
our sales doubled
from $1 million to $2 million.
In 2019, they doubled again
to $4 million.
Since "Shark Tank", we've done
over $57 million in sales.
Whoa!
Justin: The success
of single-serve really
saved the business.
It allowed us to be
in a lot more stores
where the bag-in-box
just couldn't be sold.
Aimy: Our success has made it
so we were able to sponsor
tons of music festivals
and have a great time
with our customers and BeatBox.
Brad: We were in about
2,000 7-Elevens this year.
We went from having
one distributor
to now having
over 250 distributors
across 48 states.
It's absolutely
mind-blowing.
People today don't buy products.
They don't buy brands.
They buy part
of a community.
Aimy, Brad and Justin
are great entrepreneurs
because they're always looking
for new ways
to create experiences
for their customers,
and they have fun with it.
It's just a really cool,
really fun brand
that everybody can relate to.
You were able to fight your way
back from the depths
of BeatBox hell
to now be on top of the world
and changing the game.
My advice to entrepreneurs
out there is that the road
to success is certainly
not a straight line.
The entrepreneurial roller
coaster is very, very real.
You'll have some of
your best days ever
and some of
your lowest days ever.
But if you're passionate
about what you're bringing
to the world,
just don't give up.
To all our supporters
and to "Shark Tank"...
Together: Let's party!
Whoo!
