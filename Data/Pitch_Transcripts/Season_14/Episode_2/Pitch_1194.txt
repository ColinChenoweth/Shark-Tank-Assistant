My name is Brian Brunsing,
and I'm from Buffalo, New York.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Brian.
And I'm Kirk.
And we're here from the home
of the Pro Football
Hall of Fame -- Canton, Ohio.
We're here seeking $100,000
for a 10% stake in our company.
Sharks, have you ever cooked
a chicken that was so dry
it was barely edible?
Or served a turkey at
Thanksgiving
that was so parched your guests
wanted to offer it a drink?
Well, that's
why we created...
the Turbo Trusser!
The Turbo Trusser!
The Turbo Trusser is
a rapid trussing device
used when cooking
whole chickens and turkeys.
Trussing is
a technique that...
Trussing is
a technique that...
Keeps the wings
and legs close to the body.
...keeps the wings
and legs close to the body.
It cooks a bird
more evenly.
Good save.
Traditionally, this is done
with butcher's twine,
which is messy
and hard to work with.
And this is
for the birds.
[ Chicken clucks ]
But with the Turbo Trusser,
keeping your dinner
nice and juicy
is a breeze.
Just hook the Turbo Trusser
right into place.
Closing up the cavity
and sealing all the juices
to cook a perfect bird.
Check out these
incredible results.
Herjavec: Ooh!
Sharks, you'll get
a delicious, juicy
chicken or turkey
every time.
And this product
is so universal,
you can use it in ovens,
grills, smokers,
roasters, rotisseries,
deep fryers,
and heck,
even air fryers.
And best of all, it's made
of food-grade stainless steel,
and it's dishwasher safe.
And it's made right here
in the good old USA.
So which one of you Sharks
wants to take a bite
out of the poultry
industry...
Together: And make
a cluck load of money?
So each one of you Sharks
on your table,
you have samples
of our two versions.
One's a chicken Turbo Trusser,
and one is made for turkeys.
And then you also have
some chicken that was cooked
with the Turbo Trusser
today.
Kevin, we'd love
to have you come up.
Go ahead and try it out.
I would love to.
We've got a chef hat.
You know, I am Chef Wonderful.
That's right.
This is really good.
And of course,
we've got the apron.
It is very good.
[ Laughs ]
That's good.
Okay, you just pick
the Turbo Trusser up.
Yeah.
And set it in the butt there.
Okay. You set it
in the butt?
Set it in the butt.
Okay, the butt cavity.
And then lift the one leg up.
Oh, there we go.
Lift one leg up
and put it in.
Life the other leg up.
It's just that easy.
It's just that easy.
Good.
And then the other side,
do the same.
What is the chicken community
saying about
this torture device?
They really like it.
[ Laughs ]
We've sold about
11,000 units and had one return.
Wow.
Wow.
Very nice.
Brian:
People really love it.
You don't have to get
your hands all messy
when you're using
butcher's twine.
How much of this delicious
juiciness is because of this
or the way you cooked it
in that particular oven?
It's because of
the Turbo Trusser.
That's what trussing
does it.
It cooks it
so you're cooking
one piece of meat
instead of five.
So it's gonna
cook more evenly.
I don't cook,
so I'm learning so much.
Does everybody do this?
You know what?
I think a lot of people do.
But I think people are,
one, afraid to do it with twine
'cause it's --
it's intimidating
if you don't
know how to do it.
Oh, yeah, like, if you told me
to tie up a dead chicken,
I'd be, like...
Normally got to go online,
watch a 5- or 10-minute video.
So, guys,
how did you get here?
You know, how did you get
in chicken suits
on "Shark Tank", on the carpet?
Yeah, tell us your story.
For the last 18 years,
I've been working
in the pharmaceutical
industry.
I've worked for three of
the largest
pharmaceutical companies
in the world.
But Kirk and I, we met about
five or six years ago.
He was renovating
my house.
I was a contractor
for 20 years.
I went to culinary school
back in the early '90s.
I was a sous chef in a -- in a
couple big banquet kitchens
and country clubs,
but I got burnt out,
and that's how I got
into contracting.
As a contractor,
I found a problem
with straight
shut-off valves.
I invented a wrench
that has over 800 positions,
and I have
two utility patents
and I think five
design patents on it.
And I ended up
licensing it.
And then Brian's like, "I want
to start inventing, too.
This is really cool."
And I'm like,
"Okay, well, let's do it."
Yeah, it was that easy, right?
We're gonna invent our way
into chicken suits.
Right.
We've invented personally
together six products,
four in the barbecue industry,
two in the pet industry.
And then he's got
a wrench.
Before this product,
did you make any money?
Not a dime.
No.
[ Laughter ]
Not a dime.
But you know what?
We kept inventing.
O'Leary: Let's get back to this
product for a second.
How much does it cost?
How much do you make it for?
How many have you sold?
So right now, it costs --
well, on our last order,
it was $3.07 to make,
MSRP is $14.99.
And how many have you
sold in dollars?
$90,000 in sales.
So we've been in business
for eight and a half months.
60% of our sales
come from our website alone.
27% of our sales
go through distributors.
We have three distributors.
We're in 75 stores now.
Oh, you are? And how is it
selling? Is it selling through?
Yep.
Yep. Selling through.
All three of our
distributors have reordered.
We have somebody that's selling
on Amazon for us now.
He's reordered
three times.
Herjavec: Uh, Brian, I love you
guys. I love this thing.
I know nothing about it.
It's just not big enough for me.
Don't chicken out.
[ Laughter ]
Not yet.
Our margin's 82%.
O'Leary: He's a turkey.
Well done.
Brian, Kirk, I love it.
Not for me.
Thank you. Thank you, Robert.
Thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.
Brian, how would I make money
on a deal like this?
It seems like a little business,
a little bit of sales.
Doesn't seem like there's room
for a third person by any means.
Barbara,
that's a great question.
87 million turkeys
are consumed
just between
the three holidays
of Thanksgiving,
Easter, and Christmas.
We're not online
marketing experts, right?
So we're
looking for somebody
that can help us
with some marketing,
get us some
social media exposure.
But, guys, look, it's hard
to connect your product
to all those turkeys
and chickens.
I-I just don't see you
being able to scale,
which makes it really
difficult as an investor.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you very much
for your time.
Thank you, Mark.
So it's not
really investable for me.
It's not big enough, and I
really hate touching chicken.
So I just have to be honest
about that.
[ Laughs ]
And for those reasons, I am out.
But I think you'll do
really well.
We appreciate that feedback.
Thank you.
Brian, it's not
a big enough business for
an investor to make money.
I'm out.
Brian, you've got -- you've got
one turkey left.
O'Leary:
You know, guys, I look at this,
and I see the potential of it,
but there's so much work.
We don't want you guys to do
the work for us.
We're gonna do the work.
Listen, we're here.
We won't let you down.
We just need
your connections.
I mean, imagine if
Chef Wonderful
took this under his wing.
We would love to have
you under the wing.
Would love that.
But he ain't free.
He's an expensive chef.
I mean, I wish you'd had a model
already put out there
where I just had
to pour gasoline on it.
They do. They have
a product here you can sell.
So I have to don my whites.
I have to be Chef Wonderful.
I have to sell a lot of these
to make any money.
Um...
I mean, I -- Ugh.
We're flexible
in our equity.
We're here
to make a deal.
Yep.
Yes, I know that.
God,
this is a royalty deal.
I-I can't believe you're not
mentioning that.
It's definitely a royalty deal.
The question is how much.
Let him talk.
I mean, how -- to get
Chef Wonderful
to back this,
and he's greedy.
The only way I would do this --
I'll give you the $100,000.
I want 33%,
but wait, there's more.
I want a dollar royalty
in perpetuity
for every one we sell.
Herjavec: Wow.
What a greedy bastard.
Whoa, whoa.
Wow.
We appreciate
that offer.
Would you do that deal
for 20% and the $1 royalty?
No, no.
Kevin.
I want to be
the third chicken.
I see this as being
something I can really
get to town on, but I've got to
make it worth my while.
I have to wet my beak.
We know it. 25%?
Look, let's -- let's be honest
with each other.
Your -- Your other inventions
were, well, dogs.
We don't want that
to happen here.
And I don't let dogs
on my watch. Okay?
I think I can make this
make money for all of us.
I want to be
the third chicken.
That's very reasonable, I think,
given the amount of work --
A dollar, and when you wholesale
this, guys,
you're not gonna have
all that much left.
Right. Exactly.
I know.
Unless you get the price
really way down.
Well, then make
them an offer, Lori.
You have one offer.
Is anybody else like
to come back in?
O'Leary: May I remind you two
something else.
Bertello Pizza Oven,
the largest selling
direct-to-consumer
pizza oven in America --
C'est moi.
Chef Wonderful.
Could you do the 33%
without the -- without
the dollar a unit royalty?
Never gonna happen.
Oh, guys, this guy's
a bottom fisher.
I don't know, man.
You don't have
to do it, guys.
Yeah, I know.
Um, 30%?
No.
Kevin!
You can walk away, guys.
