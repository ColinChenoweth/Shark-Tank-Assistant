Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kendra Bennett.
I'm from Longmont, Colorado,
and I'm here seeking $200,000
in exchange for
10% of my family's business,
Honey Bunchies.
Sharks, buckle up
for a true "Top Gun" story
with a tough-as-nails
fighter pilot
and an unstoppable love
for his sweetheart.
When my dad was an F-4 Phantom
fighter pilot in Vietnam,
he got by
on candy bars and cola.
He became hyperglycemic
and nearly diabetic,
which, of course, doesn't fly
when you're a fighter pilot.
That's why my mom created
a honey-based snack
that not only tasted great,
but gave him
a healthy source of energy.
Fast forward 35 years,
and Dad...
Hmm.
...tried to re-create
Mom's recipe,
but, Sharks,
he did
<i>not</i>
get it right.
He actually made
something better!
[ Chuckles ]
Dad managed to create a bar
that is completely unique
to the energy bar market.
42% of every
Honey Bunchies gourmet honey bar
is pure honey...
Mmm.
...mixed with crunchy nuts
and covered in lightly salted
and roasted sunflower kernels.
It's the perfect
honey-packed energy boost
that's gluten free,
grain-free, and soy-free.
And our coconut almond bar
is peanut-free --
and, Mr. Cuban -- dairy-free.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, yeah.
We're changing the stale,
boring world of bars.
So, Sharks, let me ask you,
who's ready to suit up
and get on the flight line
with Honey Bunchies
gourmet honey bars?
[ Chuckles ]
Good job.
-Great job.
-Nice.
And if you don't mind,
this is actually
my dad's aviator jacket...
Cuban: Oh, that's cool.
...but it's really hot.
Very cool. Very cool.
Corcoran: Yeah.
Cuban: Can we try them?
Oh, please do. Please do.
Wow. Honey is truly
the main ingredient.
Coconut almond is good.
Thank you.
Wow.
It's really, really,
really good.
John: That
coconut almond's good.
Mmm, so yummy and delicious.
Not too sweet.
These things
are amazing.
Bennett: Thank you. [ Laughs ]
They're really good.
Yeah, they're really good.
And you know what?
My dad actually named
the bar after my mom,
who he calls "Honey Bunchy."
And they would have liked
to have been here with us today,
but because of my dad's PTSD,
they couldn't come.
So what year did your father
start the company?
So, he started
the company in 2010,
but he had no background
in food and beverage,
so the first three years was
just building the foundation.
But we started
retailing in 2013.
Our first major retailer
was Whole Foods.
We're in a total
of 1,200 stores now.
Greiner: Good for you.
We're in Whole Foods'
Rocky Mountain region.
We're in the Kroger banner,
King Soopers and City Market
in Colorado.
We're in Natural Grocers,
about 19 different states.
We actually do really well
in non-grocery, as well.
So, we have a lot of independent
shops all over the country.
John: What is the cost to make,
and what do you sell them at?
Our retail is $2.99.
Yeah?
It costs us 81 cents
to produce a bar.
What are your sales?
Year to date,
we are at $300K.
We expect to end this year
at $519,000.
And what will you make
on that $519,000?
We estimate about $22K.
But what's really exciting
is that, next year,
we're projecting
$2.2 to $4.2 million.
What?!
Such a large jump.
What's going to happen?
It <i>is</i> a large jump,
and there are five reasons
for that large jump.
Not six. Not six -- five.
Okay. Let's hear all five.
7-Eleven.
Okay.
Number two,
three nationwide distributors.
Number three,
a national retailer
that sells by the box,
not by the bar.
Number four is
the anticipated growth
that we're expecting online
because of the billboard
the first three
are going to create.
Number five is
our private-label client,
who is partly owned
by two world-known athletes.
So these aren't guaranteed
purchase orders.
You're just in dialogue
with them, right?
Actually,
7-Eleven is happening.
Is a purchase order
in hand,
and that's half
of the estimate?
It's as close as you're going to
get to a purchase order in hand.
It is the opportunity to sell
into all 8,500 stores
at the 7-Eleven annual
trade show in February, so --
Do you have that order,
though?
They had an application process
with 700 applicants
for their Brands with Heart
program,
which they are using to support
emerging brands such as ours.
We were in the top 1%
to be offered a free booth
at their annual trade show
to sell into 8,500 stores.
So that is happening.
We are going
to the trade show.
So, wait a second.
So they're not
guaranteeing you any sales
to any of the franchisees
or corporate owned, right?
Not guaranteed.
But, come on.
[ Laughs ]
I know how to sell.
O'Leary: You still have to
convince store by store...
Yes.
...or region by region
to take on the SKU?
I don't think
it'll be that difficult.
We'll be at a trade show. All of
them will be there in two days.
Ohh, I felt that way
many times in life.
Kendra's high sales projection
for her honey-based energy bar,
Honey Bunchies.
O'Leary: I want to
understand it. They've
approved the product.
Bennett: Yes.
It's now your job to sell it
into the regions?
They've approved the product.
We're already in
14 7-Eleven stores,
and we have proof of concept.
We know it sells there,
so --
Kendra, look.
Great product. I loved it.
They tasted amazing.
But the energy bar/
candy bar business
is brutally competitive,
and you're able
to run profitably,
put $22K to the bottom line
and continue to scale it,
and I know you want
to accelerate that,
'cause that's what we do,
put gas on the fire,
but it'll take so much
to get to a point where
there's a return for me.
I just don't see it.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Kendra, your parents' story,
fabulous.
I -- I'm not personally
a big fan of honey,
and that's just
my thing.
Most of the world is.
But I have to love
what I invest in.
It's just
not right for me.
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.
You're such an optimist.
That's what makes you
a great salesperson.
It's your biggest
liability, too.
You're projecting $2.2 million
in sales next year.
Of course you're feeling
optimistic that you'll get them,
and I hope you do.
But you don't invest
on someone's optimism.
You like to see the fact
that justifies the figure.
I wouldn't be as far as I am
if I were
<i>only</i>
an optimist.
No, you're not.
We've been in business for --
You're a very hard worker
and an optimist.
But in projecting out,
optimists
tend to overestimate.
So because I don't have
that belief in the numbers
as much as you do,
I am out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Family businesses are often
tough for an investor.
Often, I find it challenging
to come in and disrupt
whatever is going on,
so I'm out.
Kendra, the amount of work
ahead of you is unbelievable.
Yeah. But you know what?
We are a hard-working team.
No, I believe you.
I believe you.
But, you know, you don't know
what you don't know yet.
But <i>you</i> can tell us
what we don't know,
if that is necessary.
We have stretched our own
personal money all this way.
I respect that,
but to take on an investor
with a valuation that's
completely insane at this point.
Well, then, make me an offer
that fits the valuation
that you're interested in.
No, no, I just -- It's...
Aw.
[ Voice breaking ]
This is...everything.
Kendra, the road of
entrepreneurship
is not a destination,
it's a journey.
It is full of heartbreak
for everybody.
I-I gotta tell you, I don't
make emotional decisions
when I invest.
I make pragmatic,
factual decisions
because I have to deal with
what's put in front of me.
I can't take this journey
with you.
I'm out.
Thanks, Kendra. All the best.
Thank you, Kendra.
Thank you. I appreciate
your time. Thank you.
Good luck.
Corcoran: Good luck to you.
Good luck.
