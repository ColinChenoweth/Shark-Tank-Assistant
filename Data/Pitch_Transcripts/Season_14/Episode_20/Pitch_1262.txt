Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kendra Bennett.
These things
are amazing.
Bennett: Thank you. [ Laughs ]
Kendra's high sales projection
for her honey-based energy bar,
Honey Bunchies.
Bennett: Yes.
It's now your job to sell it
into the regions?
They've approved the product.
We're already in
14 7-Eleven stores,
Kendra, look.
Great product. I loved it.
They tasted amazing.
Kendra, your parents' story,
fabulous.
I -- I'm not personally
a big fan of honey,
Kendra, the amount of work
ahead of you is unbelievable.
Yeah. But you know what?
We are a hard-working team.
No, I believe you.
I believe you.
But, you know, you don't know
what you don't know yet.
But <i>you</i> can tell us
what we don't know,
if that is necessary.
We have stretched our own
personal money all this way.
I respect that,
but to take on an investor
with a valuation that's
completely insane at this point.
Well, then, make me an offer
that fits the valuation
that you're interested in.
No, no, I just -- It's...
Aw.
[ Voice breaking ]
This is...everything.
Kendra, the road of
entrepreneurship
is not a destination,
it's a journey.
It is full of heartbreak
for everybody.
I-I gotta tell you, I don't
make emotional decisions
when I invest.
I make pragmatic,
factual decisions
because I have to deal with
what's put in front of me.
I can't take this journey
with you.
I'm out.
Thanks, Kendra. All the best.
Thank you, Kendra.
Thank you. I appreciate
your time. Thank you.
Good luck.
Corcoran: Good luck to you.
Good luck.
