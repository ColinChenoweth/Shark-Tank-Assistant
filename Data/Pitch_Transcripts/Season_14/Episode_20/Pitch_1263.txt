Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kayla Lupean.
Kayla, this is very admirable,
what you've done, okay?
Thank you.
I'm out.
This is not
a business for me.
Okay.
Kayla, one,
quite impressed...
Thank you.
...that you didn't know
how to do any of this
Yeah, Kayla,
you deserve a ton of credit.
I mean, the adversity
you fought through.
But you're also
in a great position,
O'Leary: You know, Kayla,
it occurs to me that she said
all those nice things to you
just before she became a savage.
[ Laughter ]
No, not hardly a savage.
I've already given 10%
to another investor,
so that would only
leave me with 60%.
Do you know what?
I forgot about that.
Yeah, I'll take 20%,
but I want $7
per portable dollhouse.
It just doesn't end.
Until paid back only.
Deal. I'll take it.
It's a deal.
Cuban: The right decision.
Oh, my gosh!
Thank you so much.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you so much.
It's my pleasure.
You're my girl.
I appreciate it.
I am your girl <i>now.</i>
You know that, right?
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Ooh, I'm excited.
Thank you guys so much.
O'Leary:
Congratulations, Kayla.
This is like
a dream come true.
Congratulations.
