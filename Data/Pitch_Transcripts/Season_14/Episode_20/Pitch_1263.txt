Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kayla Lupean.
I'm from Cleveland, Ohio,
and I am seeking $150,000
for 10% of my company,
Play Maysie.
Sharks,
my daughter loves to play,
but as a first-time mom,
I was clueless
to the frustrations
that toys add to a household.
I was investing more time
trying to find missing pieces
than my daughter
was spending playing with them.
Not to mention, walking around
the house at night
was like navigating
a minefield of loose toys.
One wrong step, and bam, ahh.
I scream, she wakes up,
and I still have a house
full of toys to clean up.
Toys should bring joy to a home,
not mess.
That's why I created
Play Maysie.
Play Maysie is
a portable dollhouse
for quality play on the go
and less mess at home.
Our cases were inspired
by vintage tin lunch boxes
that open on both sides
to reveal
two interchangeable rooms.
Our magnetic floors
with attached wooden furniture
means no loose pieces,
no lost pieces,
and no more bottom-of-the-foot
owies for moms and dads.
When playtime is over,
simply close your case,
put them on a shelf,
stack them in a pile,
or hang them on a hook for easy
cleanup and all-in-one storage.
Whether you're planning
a long car ride
or just looking to clear
the clutter in your home,
Play Maysie keeps your child's
imagination active
and your cleaning to-do list
a little bit shorter.
So, who's ready to help me save
the soles of parents
all across America
with Play Maysie?
Great presentation.
Greiner: It's very cute.
So this is it
in front of us?
So, in front of you,
you each have a case.
Mark, you have our wild case.
I'm wild, baby.
[ Laughs ]
The wild case is
camping and fishing.
Barbara,
you have our home case,
which is a kitchen
and living room.
My favorite room.
Mr. Wonderful, you have red,
so it would match you.
Yes, I like that.
You could try it on.
Yeah.
And, Lori,
you have our cozy case,
which is a bedroom
and bathroom.
And, Daymond,
you also have our wild case.
Wild.
Well, that's kinda cool.
Greiner: Very cute.
Thank you. Yes.
It's like
a magnetic dollhouse, right?
Are there only
two characters?
So, there's a set of
six characters,
and it was really important
to me, two things --
to make this very
gender-neutral.
I believe that doll play,
especially for boys,
is very important,
and I really wanted everything
to be as inclusive
as it could be for the first
launch of the product.
My goal with this is to expand
the line of cases,
building out
the character storylines.
So, I just finished
the first book
that the illustrations
are almost done,
that is about each character,
and I want this to be a brand
where kids get to know
the characters,
love the characters.
I am going to be the next
big toy brand in America.
Aha!
Tell us about you.
Tell us your story.
So, in 2013,
I got divorced.
I moved out on my own
for the very first time.
I'd never lived by myself.
And I really invested
the next few years
in building
my photography business.
And so, I had dated
for a few years.
Nothing was working out.
And I kind of jokingly said
to my mom,
"Maybe someday I'll just adopt
and I'll do this on my own."
She worked at
an OB/GYN clinic.
I asked if anyone ever came in
looking to place their baby.
Wow.
She asked the doctor,
said it hadn't happened
in 25 years,
and the next day,
a couple came in asking
if he knew anyone
looking to adopt.
Unbelievable.
Oh, wow. That's fate.
-Wow.
-Wow.
And that's my daughter
on the front of the packaging.
So, it's really been
an amazing journey.
Christmas of 2020 --
I was a wedding photographer
previously,
lost all my business
with COVID.
And then, Christmas night,
I had this idea,
and I took my $25,000
personal savings,
built a Kickstarter.
Damn.
I filed all of my trademarks.
I did the provisional patent,
the website, an initial logo.
Okay, what does
it cost landed? All --
So, landed is about $13.
Including all
the components?
Including everything.
And that's --
And what do you
sell it for online?
I sell them for $49.99,
so we have about a 70% margin.
So, tell us about
the business.
Yeah, so I launched
my Kickstarter March of 2021.
How much did you
try to raise,
and how much did you
end up raising?
So, I had tried to
raise $25,000.
I ended up raising $30,000,
all organically.
I immediately took
that $30,000
and started the molds
for the tins.
I was short on money
for the production run,
so I sold my car.
We received the product
November 15th, and then
we ended up closing out 2021
with total revenue of $170,000.
-Wow!
-Wow!
Good for you.
And what are your
year-to-date sales?
So, I ran into an issue.
[ Laughs ]
So, I knew that I was going to
receive a purchase order,
and they wouldn't tell me
how much inventory
it was going to be for.
That's difficult.
But in order for me
to get it in time,
I needed to place the order
before I would know
the quantity.
So I ordered
5,000 units.
How much did they
wind up ordering?
So they only ordered
a few hundred cases.
Oh, God.
I did find an investor.
They invested $85,000 to pay for
the inventory and the shipping.
They took 10%, and it has been
the biggest blessing to be able
to get there.
Sales year to date,
I think, are $55,000.
And what do you think it will be
the end of the year?
I think I'll be around $400,000
at the end of the year.
$400,000? How much inventory
do you have on hand?
What is it worth
right now?
I have just over
9,000 units on hand,
and that's worth about
half a million in revenue.
Okay. I don't feel
like I've gotten
the -- the vision
of growth clearly.
Okay.
I like the product.
However, as for the business,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you so much, Daymond.
Kayla, this is very admirable,
what you've done, okay?
Thank you.
I'm out.
This is not
a business for me.
Okay.
Kayla, one,
quite impressed...
Thank you.
...that you didn't know
how to do any of this
and you created rapidly
a really wonderful toy.
But I go for
the three P's --
passion, perseverance,
and product.
And for me, you're passion,
you're perseverance.
But the product just isn't
the right product for me.
Okay. Okay.
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, Kayla,
you deserve a ton of credit.
I mean, the adversity
you fought through.
But you're also
in a great position,
and I don't think you're giving
yourself enough credit there.
And if you just keep it simple,
you can have a business
where you're making $200,000,
$300,000, $400,000 a year,
starting next year,
and then look to scale.
Okay.
I think you're trying to do
too much too soon.
Okay.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Well, I appreciate that.
You're welcome.
I'm happy you saved
the best for last.
I don't think there's
a more adorable product
than what I see here.
It's well-designed.
It's well-thought-through.
Everything
packages so well.
But more important
than the business,
[Voice breaking]
you've got the courage.
Thank you.
You demonstrated the courage
all along the way
to be who
you wanted to be.
I'm so overwhelmed
by that, alright?
I think the idea that
you became a single mother --
1 in 100 women who say that
actually do it.
You went and did it,
and you deserve
the good luck
of finding your daughter,
of course.
When I was a little kid,
my mother invented this.
Her toys for the ten of us
were the Sears Roebuck catalog
where we cut out beds and plates
and sheets and made our houses,
and she painted
all the clothespins
that she hung the wash with,
all different figures,
and we played with it
for hours and hours every day.
I don't know why
they're not buying in,
but if they're not
buying in,
I'm going to make you
a greedy offer...
Okay.
...because I have
no competition.
Okay.
Okay. So, I would like to have
$150,000 for 30%
and $5 per portable dollhouse
you sell
until I recoup
my investment.
O'Leary: That's outrageous!
Whoa.
Wow.
Barbara!
Ooh, Kevin, how can you make
an offer like that, Kevin?
Oh, my goodness.
Would you be willing to either
go down to 20% with that deal,
or if we did the 30%,
would you be able to go up
to $200,000 for the investment?
I would give you $150,000
and another $100,000 credit line
if you keep it at 30%.
O'Leary: You know, Kayla,
it occurs to me that she said
all those nice things to you
just before she became a savage.
[ Laughter ]
No, not hardly a savage.
I've already given 10%
to another investor,
so that would only
leave me with 60%.
Do you know what?
I forgot about that.
Yeah, I'll take 20%,
but I want $7
per portable dollhouse.
It just doesn't end.
Until paid back only.
Deal. I'll take it.
It's a deal.
Cuban: The right decision.
Oh, my gosh!
Thank you so much.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you so much.
It's my pleasure.
You're my girl.
I appreciate it.
I am your girl <i>now.</i>
You know that, right?
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
Ooh, I'm excited.
Thank you guys so much.
O'Leary:
Congratulations, Kayla.
This is like
a dream come true.
Congratulations.
