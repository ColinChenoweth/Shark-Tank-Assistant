My name is Hector Saldivar,
Hector, how many
years ago was that?
We started in 2019.
Tell us what your revenues are
for the last three years.
So in 2020,
we did $900,000.
-Wow.
-Wow.
Okay.
In 2021,
we did $1.5 million.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, on our home.
Damn, Hector.
Yeah.
Well...
at projected
$4 million in sales,
you're doing
something right.
But I just don't like...
It's not that
I dislike Mexican food.
I just don't love it.
I don't believe that I would
have the passion to be able
to help you with this,
so I'm out.
Thank you so much, Daymond.
I appreciate it.
Yeah, Hector,
I'm along the same lines.
I think
the tortillas were great,
but you're in a business
that's a grind.
I just don't see the numbers
working for me.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Let's focus on that, Hector,
because you never told me
what it costs you
to make the product.
Right.
So walk me through
the cactus
grain-free sea salt.
Let's just go with this one.
What does it cost to make this?
Yeah, that bag
cost us $1.50.
Yes.
Hector, while he's thinking.
I'm going to jump in.
I think you've done
a really great job.
What concerns me, though,
is you have a lot of debt.
There's a lot going on
financially
that really worries me.
So for me,
it's not the right investment.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
As usual, all roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful.
I've heard that
so many times.
Unfortunately,
so have we.
It's a tough deal.
I think you asked too much,
because Lori's right --
You got a ton of debt
on this thing,
I'm taking a huge risk here,
Hector. Huge.
This is like
a line of credit you're...?
Yeah, I'll do it
as a line of credit.
You draw it down, but I want
first money back first.
Absolutely.
Are you allowed to
subordinate?
Are you able
to subordinate the debt?
Yes, absolutely. Yes.
Okay.
The concern here is the double
of the equity that I --
Hector, I'm sorry.
You don't have
to do this deal,
but it's the only one
I'm going to do.
Hector has an offer
from Kevin --
$500,000 as a line of credit
at 12.5% interest
for 10% of his grain-free
Mexican snack company,
Tia Lupita.
You don't have
to do this deal,
but it's the only one
I'm going to do, Hector.
Think you'd get a better deal
elsewhere, Hector,
speaking on your behalf.
That's a rich deal.
Well, you didn't make him
an offer, Barbara.
I was honest about that
right up front.
Barbara's right.
Barbara's right.
You wanted an offer on
"Shark Tank," you just got one.
You may not like it, but that's
why they call it the Shark Tank.
You can counter.
You can counter.
[ Sighs ]
Yeah. I mean, I think,
Mr. Wonderful, the 10%
is the only thing that is --
that is rattling me.
I don't know if
it's worth anything yet.
Do you know what it takes
to sell a company
in the snack area?
You gotta get to
$50 million
before any strategic's
even interested.
What are you
willing to give?
I'm sorry.
I know my value, Hector.
You gotta make a decision.
I'm not flexible.
Is there any flexibility
with the equity?
$500,000 -- I cry like a baby
when I lose $500,000.
Hector, you have a deal.
Yeah, Kevin!
O'Leary: Good job, Hector.
Ohh, yes!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Tortillas for everybody!
Mr. Wonderful,
it's a pleasure.
You, too, man.
Thank you so much.
Great, great.
That's really great.
Yes, thank you so much.
Congratulations, Hector.
Well done.
Thank you so much, guys.
I appreciate you.
