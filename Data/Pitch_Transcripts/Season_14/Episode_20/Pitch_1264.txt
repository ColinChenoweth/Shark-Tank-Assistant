My name is Hector Saldivar,
and I'm from
Tiburon, California.
"Tiburon" means "shark."
[ Scattered laughter ]
I'm seeking $500,000 in exchange
of 5% of my company,
Tia Lupita.
Oh, God.
Sharks, I'm going to ask you
for a favor.
Raise your hand
if you like to eat tacos.
Come on. We all do.
No tacos for you, Daymond?
I hate tacos.
Whoa.
Raise your other hand
if you like to eat
clean, simple ingredients.
Now try to touch your ears
with your elbows.
Nobody can do that.
You can't.
It's impossible.
Yeah.
Believe me, I've tried.
It's impossible,
just like it's impossible
for current Mexican brands
to bring innovation
and keep their authenticity
using artificial ingredients,
binders, and fillers.
Growing up in Mexico, we don't
inherit cars, jewelry, or money.
What gets passed down to us
are our family recipes.
Mmm.
Enter Tia Lupita Foods,
the better-for-you
Mexican-inspired food brand
that uses clean,
simple ingredients
that starts with one of the
world's most sustainable plants,
the cactus.
Cactus, or <i>nopales,</i>
is Mexico's sweetheart,
a low-glycemic superfood
that we use in our line of
grain-free tortilla chips
and tortillas.
Sharks, be prepared
to fall in love
with our five flavors
of tortilla chips.
They have all the crunch
and texture that you're used to,
but are packed with superfoods,
making them
a great source of fiber.
And we have two
types of tortillas,
a grain-free and cactus made
with upcycled okara and cassava,
and a corn and cactus.
Now, if you're wondering
why they're green,
it's because of all the <i>dinero</i>
we're going to make together.
[ Scattered laughter ]
At Tia Lupita,
we believe two things --
food is love,
and eating good should be easier
than trying to touch your ears
with your elbows.
So who's ready to make every day
Taco Tuesday in America
with Tia Lupita?
Nicely done.
Greiner: So, I have
some tortillas.
There's a bag here
of cactus tortillas.
Hot!
It's very, very hot.
And then there's
Habanero, Chipotle,
Salsa Verde,
and Hot Sauce.
Yes.
Oh, it's hot.
[ Laughs ]
You should have started
with a little Salsa Verde,
and then go into
the medium body Hot Sauce,
which is what we call the OG,
then Chipotle and then Habanero.
This is one of
the first iterations
of grain-free tortilla chips
that tastes good.
Thank you so much,
Mr. Wonderful. It means a lot.
The tortillas
are good,
and it's only 45 calories
for a whole tortilla?
Absolutely, yes.
Give us your background
and why
you decided
to go into your business.
I'm originally from
Monterrey, Mexico.
I moved here 18 years ago.
My mom, Lupita,
would ship me care packages,
like a regular mom does.
Now, granted, a regular
care package would be
a sweater or some socks,
maybe a little money,
if you're lucky.
My mom would send me hot sauce.
It's a family recipe hot sauce.
It had been passed down to
a single family member.
So I started sharing that
with friends and colleagues,
and everybody started falling
in love with my mom's hot sauce.
Then they started
planting the seed.
And so I started
ideating this --
bottling
and commercializing this,
my mom's hot sauce.
I came to the realization that
the current Mexican brands
or Hispanic brands here
in the United States
were not doing anything
to innovate.
We would bring innovation,
and we were trying to change
the perception
that Mexican food is unhealthy.
And that's when I decided
that Tia Lupita would become
more than just
a hot sauce brand.
It would become
a platform brand.
Hector, how many
years ago was that?
We started in 2019.
Tell us what your revenues are
for the last three years.
So in 2020,
we did $900,000.
-Wow.
-Wow.
Okay.
In 2021,
we did $1.5 million.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
And this year,
we're going to do $4 million.
Wow!
Are you profitable?
Last month was our
first profitable month.
Congrats. Congrats.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
We're very proud.
And where
are you selling?
We're in Sprouts nationally,
five regions of Whole Foods,
key regional accounts
from Wegmans to Walmart.
We have Target on site,
Publix.
Do you have to pay
to get listed there?
And, actually, last year, we
took a huge hit with slotting.
How big is that hit?
So in 2020,
we lost around $700K.
Okay.
Ohh.
In 2021, we lost $1.2.
Ooh, so how much have
you invested or brought in?
We've raised $1.9.
Corcoran: Wow.
There you have it.
$1.9 so far,
and now we're doing a full seed.
What percentage of the company
do you own?
I still own around 65%.
65%.
And how much of your own money
did you invest?
Around $700K.
Wow.
Wow. You're all in.
Good for you.
We did a line of credit
against our mortgage
and all that.
On your home?
Yeah, on our home.
Damn, Hector.
Yeah.
Well...
at projected
$4 million in sales,
you're doing
something right.
But I just don't like...
It's not that
I dislike Mexican food.
I just don't love it.
I don't believe that I would
have the passion to be able
to help you with this,
so I'm out.
Thank you so much, Daymond.
I appreciate it.
I think this is a long journey
and a cash-rich journey.
I don't think the 5%
for $500,000 is going
to get you there.
I'm out.
Thank you so much, Barbara.
Yeah, Hector,
I'm along the same lines.
I think
the tortillas were great,
but you're in a business
that's a grind.
I just don't see the numbers
working for me.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Absolutely. And so, Mark,
I appreciate that.
And we do have
a path of profitability.
We proved it last month.
Let's focus on that, Hector,
because you never told me
what it costs you
to make the product.
Right.
So walk me through
the cactus
grain-free sea salt.
Let's just go with this one.
What does it cost to make this?
Yeah, that bag
cost us $1.50.
Yes.
And then we retail it
between $3.99 and $4.99.
It's competitive with other
grain-free tortilla chips
out there.
I have been looking for
a product for Chef Wonderful
that's grain-free, 'cause that's
my whole shtick these days,
is healthier eating,
healthier living.
And this is one of the best
I've tasted,
I gotta tell you that.
But these numbers are tough.
They're very tough.
Hector, while he's thinking.
I'm going to jump in.
I think you've done
a really great job.
What concerns me, though,
is you have a lot of debt.
There's a lot going on
financially
that really worries me.
So for me,
it's not the right investment.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
As usual, all roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful.
I've heard that
so many times.
Unfortunately,
so have we.
It's a tough deal.
I think you asked too much,
because Lori's right --
You got a ton of debt
on this thing,
and you've mortgaged your house,
which scares me.
If I can say one more thing,
I just want to
try to sell myself,
because I haven't had
the opportunity.
I've worked so hard
for these last four years.
They've been everything to me.
It's honoring not only
my culture, my heritage,
my mom, right?
Today, one month ago,
my dad passed away,
and I should have been there
with my mom right now
in his one-month memorial,
but I couldn't say no
to this opportunity.
It's been a journey,
but we're all in.
Okay,
here's an offer.
I'll give you
the $500,000 in debt.
It's going to be
36 months.
I'm going to do interest
at 12.5%, which is current.
Corcoran: Ouch.
Sorry. That's current.
That's market, Barbara.
Sorry.
Still ouch.
Yeah.
And I want 10% of the company.
Oof.
I'm taking a huge risk here,
Hector. Huge.
This is like
a line of credit you're...?
Yeah, I'll do it
as a line of credit.
You draw it down, but I want
first money back first.
Absolutely.
Are you allowed to
subordinate?
Are you able
to subordinate the debt?
Yes, absolutely. Yes.
Okay.
The concern here is the double
of the equity that I --
I understand that, Hector,
but you're asking me
to get behind this product
with my whole team, back you.
If I do this deal,
I can't do another one like it.
This is my deal
in this space,
so that's a decision
I have to make.
And, frankly, I'm not
getting out of bed for 5%,
Hector, I'm sorry.
You don't have
to do this deal,
but it's the only one
I'm going to do.
Hector has an offer
from Kevin --
$500,000 as a line of credit
at 12.5% interest
for 10% of his grain-free
Mexican snack company,
Tia Lupita.
You don't have
to do this deal,
but it's the only one
I'm going to do, Hector.
Think you'd get a better deal
elsewhere, Hector,
speaking on your behalf.
That's a rich deal.
Well, you didn't make him
an offer, Barbara.
I was honest about that
right up front.
Barbara's right.
Barbara's right.
You wanted an offer on
"Shark Tank," you just got one.
You may not like it, but that's
why they call it the Shark Tank.
You can counter.
You can counter.
[ Sighs ]
Yeah. I mean, I think,
Mr. Wonderful, the 10%
is the only thing that is --
that is rattling me.
I don't know if
it's worth anything yet.
Do you know what it takes
to sell a company
in the snack area?
You gotta get to
$50 million
before any strategic's
even interested.
What are you
willing to give?
You knew we weren't
gonna for for 5%.
And, Hector, here's what
I'm also thinking --
You're going
to keep raising money.
I'm going to get diluted.
I mean, I've seen this movie
before, my friend.
If I start at 5%,
I'll have less than 1%
by the time you're finished
getting the $50 million.
Would you do the same deal
for 7.5%?
No.
I see the value of you
coming in, and, you know,
you would bring so much,
but I don't know
if that's the right deal
right now for me.
I'm different than
any investor you have.
He's more arrogant.
I'm sorry.
I know my value, Hector.
You gotta make a decision.
I'm not flexible.
Is there any flexibility
with the equity?
$500,000 -- I cry like a baby
when I lose $500,000.
Yeah.
I get on my knees
and I break down.
And it happens a lot.
[ Laughs ]
It never happens.
Well, it's a loan.
So why don't you
ask him for $750,000?
Is that a possibility?
Can I --
O'Leary: No!
Lori -- Lori didn't even
make you an offer.
Then why don't you
ask him for a million?
You can offer -- You can ask
for anything you want.
The answer's no.
Great deals,
both sides feel pain.
I'm feeling pain about $500,000
I'm putting at risk.
You're feeling pain
about the 10%
that doesn't have
any value yet.
Kevin, it's a loan.
How is it a risk?
Greiner:
Yeah, it's a loan.
It's the dilution.
He's gonna go issue shares.
I'm gonna pay you back.
That's diluting me down
from 10%.
Well, why don't you
make it non-dilutable?
I could do that,
but that would...
We can work that in. We'll make
your shares non-dilutable.
And you keep --
You'll stay at 5%.
In exchange for what?
I'll do the $500K as a line of
credit in exchange of 5%,
and that 5% that you own
will not get diluted.
Not bad.
So non-dilutable, yeah.
That's fair. Take the deal.
Lock in.
Mm.
That's a good deal right there
for you, Kevin.
Hector, you have a deal.
Yeah, Kevin!
O'Leary: Good job, Hector.
Ohh, yes!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Tortillas for everybody!
Mr. Wonderful,
it's a pleasure.
You, too, man.
Thank you so much.
Great, great.
That's really great.
Yes, thank you so much.
Congratulations, Hector.
Well done.
Thank you so much, guys.
I appreciate you.
