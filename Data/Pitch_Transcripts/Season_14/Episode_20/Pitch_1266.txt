Hi, Sharks. I'm Charisse,
and this is my wife, Vicky.
We're from San Diego,
California,
seeking $250,000 for 5% equity
in our company.
When you go
clothes shopping,
Most stores have a men's section
and a women's section.
But, Sharks, neither of those
sections work for me.
The women's section tends to
have more form-fitting clothes,
which I like --
But I don't.
And while I love
the men's style,
those clothes are just not made
for my body shape.
Sharks,
she's got a booty.
[ Laughter ]
True story!
We're all unique individuals,
and we believe
the shopping experience
should be based
on style preference
and body type,
not on gender.
That's why we decided to forge
the future of fashion with...
Together: Dapper Boi.
A genderless and size-inclusive
apparel line
made to fit you
both inside and out.
Join Dapper Boi in being part of
a revolutionary solution
that'll bring confidence
within us all.
After all, isn't it about time
that we <i>all</i> fit in?
Sharks, in front of you
are some Dapper Boi clothes
we'd love for you
to check out.
Cuban:
Good for you guys.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good for you.
O'Leary: I'm really intrigued.
Corcoran:
This is a great shirt.
I mean, do you sell
direct to consumer?
Because you're asking retailers
to create a third category,
right?
Right, and, you know, obviously,
we're not opposed
to creating this third category
or not,
but, right now, we feel
like direct to consumer
is the way to go.
Of course.
Especially, you know, with
being a mission-driven brand
and just being easy
to shop online.
Good-looking stuff.
So, are you
blowing it up on social,
or how are you getting the word
out to your community?
Yeah, so Facebook
and Instagram, mostly.
We're excited to
start dabbling
into some influencer
marketing, as well.
How'd you
come up with this?
I used to shop in
the women's department,
and those styles
were just never for me.
I never felt confident.
I felt frumpy, I felt unseen.
But we started Dapper Boi
seven years ago now,
and literally it came
from a pair of jeans.
Jeans was the first thing
I tried on
in the men's department,
and it was the scariest thing
to go to that section,
you know,
to maybe be judged.
But it was exactly
what I wanted to be.
It was, like,
the confidence I wanted.
That was my style, you know?
It was emotional.
But years later,
I realized those clothes
just never fit my body type.
And so, we -- we saw
a bunch of people
just like myself
with the same exact problem.
So, I guess that your sales
are less than a million.
I think
they're over a million.
Please, let me be wrong.
Okay, so, lifetime sales
in the last seven years,
we've done about $3.5.
Good for you.
And, actually, the way
we've run our business
is preorder campaigns.
John: That's very good.
So, we bootstrapped
the brand.
And last year,
we were at $1.2.
Yeah!
Oops!
Yeah.
I got you.
So, why don't we get
into the margins?
What do you --
What's an average margin?
Take this shirt,
for example.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that shirt is $9.40.
Oh, wow.
And we sell it
for $60.
Landed price
for jeans, $15.
We sell them for $99.
Nice.
What did you mean when you
referenced a pre-order campaign?
How does that work?
Yeah, so,
how we were able to bootstrap
is that we launch
these products at what we call
"intro pricing."
So it's usually about
a 50% margin at that point,
and that really creates
a sense of urgency
within our customers.
Our repeat customer rate
is 51%.
Wow. That's huge.
These people are waiting
for our products
to come in.
And how do you execute that,
exactly?
I've never heard that.
So, we launch a product.
We put it out on e-mail,
social, everywhere,
and then the customers go ahead
and pre-order the product,
and we usually deliver
within 6 to 10 weeks.
But I will admit here,
COVID, you know, killed us.
Right now,
with the COVID delays,
we're seeing
6, 7 months.
Cuban: Ouch.
Wow.
And so how much do you have
in inventory right now?
60 grand.
Okay.
But it's across
a lot of sizes.
And that's
what makes it tough.
How much cash
do you guys have?
Uh, maybe $100 today.
$100?
[ Sharks exclaiming ]
I'm not -- Yep.
We're at the point here
where we just sold our house.
-Oh, no.
-Oh.
It's -- It's vulnerable
and not fun to talk about,
but we believe in this brand,
like, more than anything.
So far,
you're losing money, right?
Yes.
Okay. So, this --
How much money
are you losing?
Right now?
...on intro pricing
is killing your margin.
Yeah, wait, Kevin. Kevin.
How much money are you losing?
Yeah, so I think we're about
$150,000 negative this year.
What did you lose
last year?
$313,000.
So you're $450,000
in the hole, right?
Wow.
Yep.
Guys, something
doesn't add up for me.
Yeah.
Right?
Because your margins
are like this...
Yeah.
...and your shipping costs
shouldn't be that astronomical.
Right.
What happened was,
is I also started spending
in marketing.
I hired a consultant.
-Ah.
-Ugh.
Oh.
<i>That's</i> where you went wrong.
Yeah.
Vicky: Exactly.
So how much did you
spend on marketing?
I would say, you know, it was
definitely over 30% of...
Ooh.
John: Oh, my God.
So, you have
this rabid community
that wants to buy from you.
You don't need
to market them.
It was our attempt --
and it was a wrong attempt...
Yeah.
...to try to expand
and go further,
but we were not
ready for that.
And we will be ready for that,
but not now.
That's why we need experts
like you guys to come on board.
The reason why the people are
waiting 6 and 7 or 8 months is,
like you said, it's a community,
it's a movement.
It's funny that FUBU --
For Us, By Us --
has become used a lot
in the LGBTQ+ community.
Am I right?
Yeah.
And you are
For Us, By Us.
You know, that --
that's who you are.
Why are you trying
to go anyplace else?
If other people adopt it,
it's no problem.
100%.
But why are you
going anyplace else?
There's so many people that
identify with you right now.
Stop trying to be everything
to everybody.
No, you know, I have to --
I have to argue that,
and it's because I don't want
to be categorized.
I want to fit in
with everybody.
Listen, I'm pro-Black,
but never anti-anything else.
Yeah.
Right?
No, of course. Yeah.
It doesn't mean that
other people won't accept you.
Yeah.
So I have to be honest.
I have to give you
my assessment of the business.
I gotta try to find
a way to help you.
I'll mentor you,
but as for the business?
Appreciate it.
Yeah?
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You guys,
I like to sit here and say
I've done a million products,
and I have.
And I've done something
in just about every medium,
but the one thing
I've really never done
is jeans, clothing.
I don't know how I could
bring value to your business
and help you out.
So, unfortunately, I wish you
good luck, but I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I understand your mission.
I respect it.
There is such a need for this,
but I think your problem
is much larger cash-wise
than you envision it to be.
Even if you came in here
and we gave you
the $250,000 for your stock,
that's nothing.
That's not going
to get you over the hump.
It's just --
It's a rough one.
So I wish I could be with you,
but I am out.
I wanted to mention
one other thing,
and it's pretty
important here.
We're about to do
a collaboration
with another brand
that does jeans,
and they do
3-D modeling.
So what happens with that
is that --
Guys, guys,
don't do that.
Yeah?
Don't do
the collaboration?
No. You have
a fundamental problem.
You don't know
what business you're in.
You have this community
that's like this.
Golden.
Your clothes
are not the product.
The community is looking
to your clothes
as their membership,
as the way for them to say,
"We all belong together,"
that, "This is us."
The clothes
are secondary.
It's keeping the community
together that's important.
But I have a fundamental problem
as an investor,
because we're not on the same
page on what makes the business.
If it's about,
"I want more inventory,
I've got
this collaboration,
I've got all these
other things,"
that's not the vision
I would have,
and it's your vision
that's far more important.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Vicky: I think
the Sharks reminded us
that our community
is -- is everything.
It's not the end
of Dapper Boi.
And you know what?
At the end of the day,
we came here to build
a relationship,
and I'm so happy
that we walked out of here
with, hopefully,
a mentorship.
Yes.
So that's huge.
Yes.
