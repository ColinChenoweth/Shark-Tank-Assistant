Hi, Sharks.
My name is Brooke Knaus,
So, Brooke,
would I find you
all over social media
demonstrating this thing?
You would. I would
actually attribute
so many of my sales
to having gone viral on TikTok
within the first month or so.
What were you showing?
Well, I was sort of debunking
that bra tuck hack.
Women were doing that.
It was a very popular hack
on social media at the time.
Cuban: Look, Brooke,
great product.
Thank you.
My daughters, probably,
will love it,
Okay, so, Brooke,
I -- I'm impressed.
I mean, really,
great presentation.
Thank you.
I'm a believer in you.
I'm going off my piste
a little bit.
That's a ski term.
I'm a skier.
Me, too.
Because I really can't see
myself doing TikTok
wearing this thing,
which is what I would do
with a product.
You'd better not.
I would give you
the $70K for 40%.
Ooh.
Wow. Um...
I'd like to make
a million bucks.
Me, too.
I'd like to blow this up.
Knaus: A much larger percentage.
Well, it's the only option
you have so far.
So, do you own 100%?
100%.
Thank you. I'm so excited.
Way to negotiate, Brooke.
Oh, my God!
You're a machine!
I just can't wait
to work with you.
Alright.
Mr. Wonderful, it would have
been an honor, as well.
Thank you so much.
Well, you did a great job.
Congratulations, Brooke.
Congrats.
Knaus:
I countered with just 1%
because I didn't want
to lose Daymond.
He's worked in fashion
for so many years,
