Hi, Sharks.
My name is Brooke Knaus,
and I'm seeking $70,000
for 30% of my company.
Sharks, you know some things
about fashion.
Barbara, Lori,
I'm looking at you,
both looking
gorgeous today.
You are right on that.
[ Laughs ]
So you already know
that crop tops
are super hot right now.
But what do you do
when you have a cute top
that you want to turn
into a crop?
Well, you could...chop it
yourself,
but why ruin
a perfectly good shirt?
Or you could do
this bra tuck hack
that's really hot
on social media right now.
Whoa, Hannah! It's not
that kind of show, guys.
Hannah's just doing that tuck
that is so hot
on social media right now.
And, yes,
it keeps your shirts intact,
but the second you start
really moving around,
it just slips
right back out again.
So, Sharks,
what do you do
when those hacks
inevitably don't work?
Tucky!
Tucky turns any top
into a crop.
Here, Hannah, try this.
Tuck is an elastic band with two
silicone strips on the inside.
You just wrap it around
your waist,
securely fasten,
tuck your shirts
up and under,
and you have a lasting crop
that's secure, comfortable,
and best of all, no slippage.
Wow.
So, Sharks,
what do you think about this?
Tucky is a tool to unlock
your closets in a new way
and lets you style your clothes
in ways you'd never
thought of before.
So what do you say, Sharks?
Let's cut the crop
and get to tuckin'.
Very clever.
So this is it
in front of us?
That's it, yes.
Okay.
You each have your own Tucky
in front of you to try.
And if you need
any inspiration,
please just look
to our beautiful models.
Is the middle person wearing
this, as well?
That is indeed
a sweater over a romper.
And that is a great way
to transition your wardrobe
from summer to fall and extend
the wardrobe that you have.
Kendra here, with the pink shirt
and the blue jeans,
she's doing what I call
the no-bulk tuck.
So, she has
a very bulky sweater
that looks like
it's tucked into her jeans
without adding any extra bulk
to her waistband.
Are you wearing one?
I am wearing one right now,
yeah.
So why would you wear it
with this outfit?
I'm just curious.
Why do I need it
with this outfit?
Well, for example, if I were
to tuck this top into my skirt,
it would add more bulk
to my waistband,
which is exactly
what I don't want to happen
when I'm trying to make the most
of the figure that I have,
which does lead me
to why I created Tucky.
Okay. Yes.
Tell us your story.
So, I created Tucky
after I'd had my second child.
I was recently postpartum,
which meant that I felt a little
disconnected from the body
that I was living with.
In order to feel
back in touch with my body,
I was wearing sweatpants
and sweatshirts, matching sets,
but there's a lot of bulk
in those sets.
So I was tucking my top up
into my bra,
hiking my sweatpants up high,
and essentially creating
an hourglass figure
when I really didn't have one
again yet.
The problem was, I was playing
with my then-2-year-old
and my newborn on the floor,
picking them up,
playing with them.
My top would just slip
right back out.
So when I went online
to look for a product
that might solve this issue,
nothing existed yet.
And that's when I thought,
"If it's a problem for me,
it's probably a problem
for millions of other women."
And that's how
Tucky was born.
I get it.
You must have some sales.
I do.
I'm so glad you asked.
Let's talk about that.
So, I launched this year,
so we're looking at about
six months to date.
I've made $60,000
in gross sales.
-Okay.
-Yes.
60 -- all online,
direct to moms?
About 98% online.
I have a handful of boutiques
in Charleston, South Carolina,
that carry my belt.
Okay. What does it cost
to make this?
Landed,
packaging included, $5.
They retail for $30.
My net take-home profit has been
$40,000 so far this year.
So...
Greiner: Wow.
Okay.
Good for you.
That's a lot.
So, Brooke,
would I find you
all over social media
demonstrating this thing?
You would. I would
actually attribute
so many of my sales
to having gone viral on TikTok
within the first month or so.
What were you showing?
Well, I was sort of debunking
that bra tuck hack.
Women were doing that.
It was a very popular hack
on social media at the time.
And, you know, I said,
"There's a better way."
Cuban: Look, Brooke,
great product.
Thank you.
My daughters, probably,
will love it,
and I'll make sure
to bring this to them,
my 16-
and my 19-year-old.
But it's really not
a fit for me.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you so much.
But congrats.
You've really taken this idea
and done a great job
with it.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Okay. I think
it's a clever idea.
Okay, so, Brooke,
I -- I'm impressed.
I mean, really,
great presentation.
Thank you.
I'm a believer in you.
I'm going off my piste
a little bit.
That's a ski term.
I'm a skier.
Me, too.
Because I really can't see
myself doing TikTok
wearing this thing,
which is what I would do
with a product.
You'd better not.
I would give you
the $70K for 40%.
Ooh.
Wow. Um...
I'd like to make
a million bucks.
Me, too.
I'd like to blow this up.
And, Sharks, that is actually
why I wanted to go in here
and just offer a larger
percentage for less, because --
Knaus: A much larger percentage.
Well, it's the only option
you have so far.
So, do you own 100%?
100%.
I think it's a flier,
and I just want to beat Kevin.
So I'll give you the same
exact offer of $70,000 for 40%.
Greiner: Ooh.
Cuban: Oh, neither of those
is any good.
Oh, guys.
You'd be crazy
to take either one.
You can counter.
Would you do...39%?
Thank you. I'm so excited.
Way to negotiate, Brooke.
Oh, my God!
You're a machine!
I just can't wait
to work with you.
Alright.
Mr. Wonderful, it would have
been an honor, as well.
Thank you so much.
Well, you did a great job.
Congratulations, Brooke.
Congrats.
Knaus:
I countered with just 1%
because I didn't want
to lose Daymond.
He's worked in fashion
for so many years,
and I think
he fully understands
what Tucky can do
for a woman's wardrobe.
His involvement
and his excitement
to have that much stake
in the company
is what's going to help
Tucky grow fastest.
