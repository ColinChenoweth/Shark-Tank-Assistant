Narrator: Tonight on the season
finale of "Shark Tank"...
If you think starting
a business is tough,
try doing it
with your kid.
[ Laughter ]
It's not that kind
of show, guys.
You are right on that.
[ Laughs ]
We made $3.3 million.
Wow.
You're a machine!
I'm a little bit delusional
when it comes to business.
How many have you sold?
We've sold like 1,500 so far.
That's terrible.
How are you surviving?
This is getting de-listed.
The numbers are insane.
I made the number up.
Why do you need a Shark?
I don't have it in me
to build another company.
What would you give up
for all the Sharks?
John: Hey, Kevin, hold on.
Kevin.
What's going on
with Lori?
Narrator: First in the Tank
is a social media star
who created a business poking
fun at social media stars.
What's up, Sharks?
I'm Tank Sinatra.
I'm from New York.
I make memes, and I spread
good news for a living.
And I'm here seeking $500,000
in exchange for a whopping 10%
equity stake in my company,
Influencers in the Wild:
The Game.
Now, let's start
with the basics.
Some of you --
How do I say this? --
older, more wonderful Sharks
might be wondering,
"Tank, what is an influencer?"
Well, you see that girl
over there trying to snap
the perfect picture of herself,
distracting everyone around her?
That is an influencer.
It's all about gaining followers
on social media.
So I took the idea
of influencers
and Internet culture
in general
and built a board game
around that.
Introducing Influencers
in the Wild: The Game.
Go places, gain followers,
get famous,
no talent required.
It re-imagines
the classic board game,
except in our game, you rack up
followers instead of money.
Players make their way
around the board
one roll of the die at a time,
and just like in real life,
the player with
the most followers wins.
So, Sharks, who wants to use
their influence and money --
Let's keep it real,
that's why I'm here --
to make this the best-selling
board game of all time?
Corcoran: You gonna show us
how it works?
Yeah, how do you play?
Of course, yeah.
You're actually -- You're
being a little distracting.
There's a room back there
with great lighting.
If you want to go back there
and take some selfies,
that would be fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Thanks for your help.
Alright, so,
that was Chloe.
She's, like, a legit,
OG influencer.
Are you an influencer?
How many followers
does she have?
Yeah, Tank is big time
on Instagram.
I follow him. Tank Sinatra is,
like, the real deal.
Well, tell me about yours,
because I do not follow you.
Sinatra: Sure.
You <i>do</i> follow me.
You follow Tank's Good News.
Oh, you're Tank's Good News.
John: Oh!
Alright, alright, alright.
I follow you, as well.
I'm gonna have
to follow you, Tank.
You're making the world
a better place
with the content
you put out.
I mean, I've been a "Shark Tank"
viewer since season one.
I would not be where I am today
if it wasn't for "Shark Tank."
I learned more
watching this show...
Then this is your moment
on the carpet.
...than anything.
So let's get back...
Yeah.
Alright.
How do you play it?
So, you pick
an influencer playing piece,
you put it on Start,
you roll the die.
And I picked these
influencer travel hotspots
like Bali, Tulum,
the desert rave.
You end at the Big Pink Wall,
which is like the influencer
mecca in Los Angeles.
Heh.
And you travel around the board,
and you can lose followers
along the way,
gain followers along the way.
All of the fun
is on the blue spaces.
So when you land
on a blue space,
you have blue playing cards.
Okay. I just landed on a blue
space, and it says, "Catfish.
Someone uses your photos
on a dating app.
Gain 50K followers."
'Cause that means you're hot.
So at the end of the game,
I tally up my followers.
And whoever's
got the most...
Wins.
...I win.
Exactly. Yep.
I love this.
"Don't talk to me.
I'm verified."
Exactly. So, you know --
Tank, tell us about yourself.
How'd you get
involved in this?
I love comedy, I love sales,
I love "Shark Tank,"
and I love Jay-Z, and that's it.
[ Laughter ]
But I don't love being subject
to the whims of the algorithm,
to be honest,
to make my living.
So I think a physical product
is a smart way to expand
instead of just growing
my following,
because that's what I am
focused on all the time.
Right. So, I mean,
I give you credit.
You've got a great feel
for what's going on,
but tell me about
the business side.
So we're, like,
so new at this.
We just signed an exclusive deal
with a big-box retailer.
So if someone walks in,
and they're going to see
Influencers in the Wild,
how are they going to know
what that is, right?
And what's gonna
get them to buy?
So, we watched what happened
with Cards Against Humanity
and What Do You Meme?
They were at the same
price point as us --
But they were
small card games, right?
So it was easy to pick up
and give as a gift.
But they were also based
on an Internet meme.
Right.
So it's the same
kind of thing.
We want to educate people,
which is one of the barriers
we faced.
I'm a little bit delusional
when it comes to business.
I thought we were going to sell
a million copies on day one,
even though we only had
64,000 in stock.
Every entrepreneur
thinks that.
You know?
Then they said,
"Hey, we don't want it for Q4,
we want it for Q3.
We're going to put them
on an end cap.
You know what? We want them on
the Back To College end cap."
Oh, boy, yeah.
Then when I started
advertising,
I saw that most of our clicks
were from 25 to 44.
So I was like, "Back To College
is not even our demographic."
How many have you sold?
We've sold like 1,500 so far.
Oh. Alright.
That's terrible.
But how many doors
were you in of that --
1,900.
-Oof.
-Wow.
Yeah, it's not good.
It's not selling enough.
This is getting de-listed.
but they are concerned about
Tank's low sales
for his social media-inspired
board game,
Influencers in the Wild.
It's not selling enough.
This is getting de-listed.
It's not giving them enough
margin per linear foot.
That's what's
gonna happen.
Sinatra: Perhaps.
It's only been two months.
The margins,
in my opinion, are good.
Maybe --
Well, tell us the numbers.
Tell us the numbers.
We can get them from anywhere
from $4.97 to $5.47,
depending on
how many we buy.
And you sell it in
at what?
We retail
at direct to consumer at $30,
we sell it at the big-box
retailer at $13.31,
but that's through a broker.
We sell it to them at 38%.
That's a decent margin.
Yeah, decent for you.
Yeah, but what were your sales
direct to consumer?
We haven't sold any
direct to consumer.
How many dollars have you sold
worth of product?
The broker has sold $140,000
worth of goods.
It's -- We're gonna sell
these games, I have no doubt.
The feet -- my wife said,
"The game is getting
its little tootsies wet."
That's what happens.
But is there any other
information
that's going to justify
a $5 million valuation?
We're so new,
I made the number up.
I'll be dead honest with you.
Like, it's not a real number.
The problem is,
you picked the wrong number.
Coming in asking for $500K,
the numbers are insane.
There's just
no way to say,
"Okay, this is
a good investment,"
based off of what
you've told us so far.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
You know, I spent some time
in the toy industry.
The big guys, they get thousands
of submissions, thousands,
and 1 in 100 take off.
It's really, really hard.
I think you're a good guy,
but we all are influencers.
I've got millions
of followers.
When I invest in a product,
I get behind it,
which I would have loved
to have done on this one.
But I gotta write a check
for $500,000
to get involved with you?
That's crazy.
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm out.
Okay.
Why <i>don't</i> you think
it's worth $5 million?
Because you're
not making money.
Not yet.
Yeah, but you want us
to put our money today
based on your potential
in the future.
That's asking a lot.
We have no idea
how this is gonna sell.
Everybody's saying,
if you had come in
asking for $50K, $80K, $100K,
we'd take a flier on you.
I couldn't do that, though,
because when we go into Walmart,
they're gonna want $350,000
for 56,000 games.
That's not our problem.
No, but, Tank, see,
that's where you missed it.
You don't watch enough
"Shark Tank," right?
For us to get back
$500,000...
Yeah.
...you have to generate
$5 million
in after-tax cash flow.
Yeah.
You have to do about
$50 million in sales.
You've gotta do
so much in sales,
and that's just
getting our money back.
Well, I understand
that your money is real,
and I respect that,
and you want to get it back --
Why would I just want
my money back?
If I give you $500,000,
I want $5 million back.
I want a 10X.
That was the mistake
on this deal.
You asked too much.
Yeah.
You know,
I love social media.
I would love
to have gotten behind it
and supported it, and --
You're speaking in past tense.
I don't like that.
[ Laughter ]
But here,
I have no idea
if people are gonna
enjoy this game or like it.
It's just way too much money
for me to risk.
So, unfortunately, Tank,
while I love
<i>you,</i>
I'm out.
Let me give you another
point of view on the valuation.
So, all of us are very --
get pitched a lot.
We can easily look
for game developers.
As Kevin said,
there's thousands of them.
And for $500,000,
we can probably acquire
a 70% or 90% position
on something that has not
been discovered.
And that's the biggest
challenge for us.
But right now,
this is too rich for me.
I'm out.
Yeah, thank you.
The best thing about you as
an individual and a businessman
that I know of
is you're quick-witted.
Everything you do
is so succinct and punchy
and makes people laugh.
But to me, I think
you're just asking us all --
and I think you've heard that
over and over again --
To take a chance card
on 1,500 sold,
you're asking a lot,
so I'm out.
Alright.
Hey, Tank...
Cuban: Good luck, man.
Thank you.
I appreciate you guys.
...you should put,
in my opinion,
"Tank's Good News"
on the cover.
And if you get a chance
to go back to the warehouses
and get, you know...
Put a sticker.
...64,000 stickers
with your face on it,
with your Instagram
handles -- huge.
'Cause then there's
an immediate connection
for your millions
of followers.
Right.
So we'll put "Tank Sinatra,
Tank's Good News,"
we have a deal?
[ Laughter ]
You got a better shot,
seriously.
Thank you, guys.
Alright, good luck, man.
Good luck.
I could have asked for
less money based on the sales.
I based it more on
my presence online,
which was, in retrospect,
not the right thing to do.
But I'm such a big fan
of the show.
So just to get to be here
and meet them was a win for me.
Narrator: This season
of "Shark Tank,"
we've seen entrepreneurs
continuing to thrive,
even in the most challenging
times.
You're pushing a boulder up
the same hill every day.
There's problems
around every corner.
I have a soft spot
for entrepreneurs
because I respect
the journey so much.
Cole: No Limbits allowed me to
take something really terrible
that happened to me
and give it purpose,
and I'm really grateful
that I found mine through this,
even though it was
a painful journey to get there.
What are we gonna do?
Harrington: We had a major
logistics issue,
over 400 canceled orders.
We spent every moment
doing customer service.
We would say, "Please,
just give us an opportunity."
Riley: During the trade wars,
our tariff caused us
to have to raise prices.
Cuban: We had a conversation
about moving manufacturing
to the United States,
and you did it.
We have raised $100,000
for the FDNY Foundation.
To see what the Cup Board Pro
is doing in our dad's name --
it's so special.
I'm hoping for massive sales.
Since "Shark Tank,"
we've done over $57 million.
Krause: Scrub Daddy is one of
the top-grossing companies
in "Shark Tank" history,
doing over $670 million
in sales.
Narrator: They're innovating
and making a difference
in the world...
Demin: We're now at
400 weavers.
We've been able to infuse over
$2 million to the communities
where our hammocks
are made.
Skaya: We've gone
from a small company
to being part of
a $8 billion organization,
creating products
that will change the world.
Ulmer:
Since going on "Shark Tank"
when I was 9 years old,
we've been scaling the company,
saving the bees,
and inspiring the next
generation of changemakers.
You are the most powerful
generation we will ever have,
and I'm so proud of you all.
Narrator: ...and proving that,
with grit and determination,
anyone can be an entrepreneur.
Xu: "Shark Tank" is one of
the greatest platforms
to level the playing field
for the underdogs.
It gives equal access
to talent everywhere
so that collectively
we can all be successful.
I got to take my hat off
to my mom.
It takes a lot of guts
to migrate a country,
and it takes even bigger guts
to migrate
when you're 60 years old
to find a better future
for your son.
Moret: For any women out there
questioning if their idea
is good enough,
there's only one way
to find out.
When my mom first told me
she was proud of me,
it was amazing.
Kind of made it seem like this
is a business, this is real,
and this is success.
You're only bound
by your imagination.
To aspiring entrepreneurs,
tune in to "Shark Tank."
Listen to the stories
that those people tell.
They're real stories.
You, too, can get your idea
onto "Shark Tank"
and live the American dream
like we are.
No, I think you were wise,
because it's very hard to
get a deal in "Shark Tank."
You picked the exact approach,
the right approach.
And now he's taking
a much larger percentage.
is almost unprecedented
in "Shark Tank" history.
You know that.
Every single Shark
wants to back you guys.
Thank you.
Practically never happens.
