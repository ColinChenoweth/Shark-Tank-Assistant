Narrator: Tonight on the season
finale of "Shark Tank"...
If you think starting
a business is tough,
try doing it
with your kid.
[ Laughter ]
It's not that kind
of show, guys.
You are right on that.
[ Laughs ]
We made $3.3 million.
Wow.
You're a machine!
I'm a little bit delusional
when it comes to business.
How many have you sold?
We've sold like 1,500 so far.
That's terrible.
How are you surviving?
This is getting de-listed.
The numbers are insane.
I made the number up.
Why do you need a Shark?
I don't have it in me
to build another company.
What would you give up
for all the Sharks?
John: Hey, Kevin, hold on.
Kevin.
What's going on
with Lori?
Narrator: First in the Tank
is a social media star
who created a business poking
fun at social media stars.
What's up, Sharks?
I'm Tank Sinatra.
I'm from New York.
"Tank, what is an influencer?"
Well, you see that girl
over there trying to snap
the perfect picture of herself,
distracting everyone around her?
That is an influencer.
It's all about gaining followers
on social media.
So I took the idea
of influencers
Yeah, Tank is big time
on Instagram.
I follow him. Tank Sinatra is,
like, the real deal.
Well, tell me about yours,
because I do not follow you.
Sinatra: Sure.
You <i>do</i> follow me.
You follow Tank's Good News.
Oh, you're Tank's Good News.
John: Oh!
Alright, alright, alright.
I follow you, as well.
I'm gonna have
to follow you, Tank.
You're making the world
a better place
with the content
you put out.
I mean, I've been a "Shark Tank"
viewer since season one.
I would not be where I am today
if it wasn't for "Shark Tank."
I learned more
watching this show...
Then this is your moment
on the carpet.
...than anything.
So let's get back...
Yeah.
Alright.
How do you play it?
So, you pick
an influencer playing piece,
you put it on Start,
you roll the die.
Exactly. So, you know --
Tank, tell us about yourself.
How'd you get
involved in this?
I love comedy, I love sales,
but they are concerned about
Tank's low sales
for his social media-inspired
board game,
Influencers in the Wild.
It's not selling enough.
This is getting de-listed.
It's not giving them enough
margin per linear foot.
That's what's
gonna happen.
Sinatra: Perhaps.
It's only been two months.
The margins,
in my opinion, are good.
Maybe --
Well, tell us the numbers.
Tell us the numbers.
We can get them from anywhere
from $4.97 to $5.47,
depending on
how many we buy.
No, but, Tank, see,
that's where you missed it.
You don't watch enough
"Shark Tank," right?
For us to get back
$500,000...
Yeah.
...you have to generate
$5 million
in after-tax cash flow.
Yeah.
You have to do about
$50 million in sales.
You've gotta do
so much in sales,
So, unfortunately, Tank,
while I love
<i>you,</i>
I'm out.
Let me give you another
point of view on the valuation.
So, all of us are very --
get pitched a lot.
We can easily look
for game developers.
Hey, Tank...
Cuban: Good luck, man.
Thank you.
I appreciate you guys.
...you should put,
in my opinion,
"Tank's Good News"
on the cover.
So we'll put "Tank Sinatra,
Tank's Good News,"
we have a deal?
[ Laughter ]
You got a better shot,
seriously.
Thank you, guys.
Alright, good luck, man.
Good luck.
I could have asked for
less money based on the sales.
I based it more on
my presence online,
which was, in retrospect,
not the right thing to do.
But I'm such a big fan
of the show.
Narrator: This season
of "Shark Tank,"
we've seen entrepreneurs
continuing to thrive,
even in the most challenging
times.
You're pushing a boulder up
the same hill every day.
There's problems
around every corner.
I have a soft spot
for entrepreneurs
because I respect
the journey so much.
Cole: No Limbits allowed me to
take something really terrible
Since "Shark Tank,"
we've done over $57 million.
Krause: Scrub Daddy is one of
the top-grossing companies
in "Shark Tank" history,
doing over $670 million
in sales.
Narrator: They're innovating
Ulmer:
Since going on "Shark Tank"
when I was 9 years old,
we've been scaling the company,
saving the bees,
and inspiring the next
generation of changemakers.
You are the most powerful
generation we will ever have,
Xu: "Shark Tank" is one of
the greatest platforms
to level the playing field
for the underdogs.
It gives equal access
to talent everywhere
so that collectively
we can all be successful.
I got to take my hat off
to my mom.
It takes a lot of guts
to migrate a country,
To aspiring entrepreneurs,
tune in to "Shark Tank."
Listen to the stories
that those people tell.
They're real stories.
You, too, can get your idea
onto "Shark Tank"
No, I think you were wise,
because it's very hard to
get a deal in "Shark Tank."
You picked the exact approach,
the right approach.
is almost unprecedented
in "Shark Tank" history.
You know that.
Every single Shark
wants to back you guys.
Thank you.
Practically never happens.
