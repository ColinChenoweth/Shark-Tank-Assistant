Baer: Since doing a deal
with Mark and Peter
only a couple months ago,
we've done over $8.7 million
in sales.
Haaber: We've sold more
than 85,000 goggles
and made more than
$4.1 million.
Mark, you have our reversible
basketball shorts with pockets.
I like that.
Ladies, we know that we have
to have pockets in all items.
So if you turn that thing inside
out, it's a whole nother pair.
I like it.
Thank you.
Right here, we have our
Winston-Salem
half-zip windbreaker.
In front of you,
Mr. Wonderful,
is our reversible
satin jacket.
So if you unzip that, it's going
to turn to a whole nother side.
Lori, you have our other
windbreaker.
It's a full-zip.
It gives you a blast
from the past, a '90s feel.
And, Daymond, you also have
our reversible jacket
from my alma mater,
Norfolk State University.
Nice quality.
How much does
it cost you to make,
and how much
do you sell it for?
The jacket that you have
right there,
we get it for $28.
We sell it on our site
for $110.
We sell it to
the department store for $56.
The reversible shorts
right there, we get for $20.
We sell it to
the department store for $48.
They sell it for $100.
Our reversible jackets,
we pay $30 for that.
We charge $165.
How did you start to do this,
and what's your background?
So, I designed from early
high school into college.
It became a side hustle.
I began designing for
every organization on campus,
and I seen there
that nothing looked
like the things
that I was designing.
So I decided
to start my own brand.
At the beginning,
I was doing Greek apparel,
and then I decided
to make HBCU apparel
because I seen that there was
a bigger need in that community.
And how many HBCUs,
or, you know,
historical Black colleges
and universities,
how many of those exist?
Depending on the person,
some might say 100,
some might say 102.
And you have 40 licenses
already in existence?
Yes.
So that's great.
You have almost
half of them, right?
Yes. But the thing is,
I've gotten our license
for everybody
that allows it.
The other schools,
they don't have
licensing programs
in place.
They don't have
licensing programs in place?
Yes.
That might be an opportunity
for you right there.
Absolutely.
So, very big.
The number-one shoemaker
in the world
has just invested,
I think,
a couple billion
over 15 years to HBCUs.
Yes.
So this is a very, very hot
and fast-growing area.
I tell you, what gets me
hot to trot is sales.
Yes.
What do you got?
To date, we've made $3.3 million
since --
-Whoo!
-Whoa!
The total over
what period of time?
Since 2017.
So what have you sold
the last 12 months?
The last 12 months,
we're at $1.4 million.
Wow.
Can you walk me through
this calendar year's sales
and potential profits?
And how they break down,
online versus retail?
Okay, this calendar year so far,
we've made about $1.1 million.
That equals up,
I want to say, maybe 75%.
The rest are e-commerce.
We're currently in
Dick's Sporting Goods,
Follett, which services 25
of the HBCU bookstores...
Wow.
...and also on Fanatics.
Literally two days ago,
I got a purchase order
from Follett
for $973,000
for our fall.
-Wow.
-Wow.
So...
Greiner: Good for you.
How exciting.
So, are you gonna
make money this year?
Yes, we are.
What do you think
you'll make?
To date, we revenue --
we have $343,000
that we made this year
from the 1.1 --
Okay. So you've profited
about 25% so far.
Yes.
You've got a purchase order
for $973,000 coming in.
Yes, sir.
Plus, you've got all your
other sales that are coming --
And then, also, we have
more department stores.
How are you
financing them?
We have a really good
manufacturer.
He allows for us to pay him
after we get our payment.
Wow.
John: Now,
this is very creative,
and this is what,
in our business,
we call the factories
holding the paper.
Yes.
That's what we called it,
right,
and a lot of people
can learn from this.
So you were able to scale
because he's doing that.
So, what would the money
be used for, then?
The money would be used for --
we're actually in-house.
We have a five-person team.
So once they get here,
we have to tag them, all that.
I want to go into fulfillment
and having a 3PL company tag it,
getting it ready
for department stores
to make sure that that's right.
Well, you don't have to pay
for a 3PL per se.
You find a good 3PL,
and then you send them
the inventory,
and then you only pay
as they pick and pack.
Ship them out.
Yes. We would also use it
for marketing.
We've only spent $50,000
in marketing.
But do you need to spend
anything on marketing?
I honestly believe
that we do,
because all the stores
that we're in,
we're not even --
we don't have, like,
a key place in the store.
We actually wanted,
those other schools
that we don't have
licensing for,
convincing them,
"Hey, choose us."
Yeah, marketing
won't change their mind.
The sell-through will.
Okay, yeah.
Are you running this
yourself?
Yes, I'm head designer.
I'm talking to
the manufacturers.
This is your baby and
you're running it day to day,
or is there
a separate CEO?
No, I'm day to day.
You're everything, right?
[ Laughs ]
Every hat, every hat.
I think -- I'm not sure
how big the market is for it.
So while I think you have
a great little business for you
and I think you will do well,
I don't think it's the right
business for me as a partner.
So I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.
Thank you so much.
And I actually would love
to address a few things that
you just mentioned.
So, Tucky's primary market
is between the ages
of 17 and 25 years old.
There are 15 million women
in the U. S. alone
in that demographic.
You know what I love
about this business?
It's so simple.
You have one SKU,
and it sells for 30 bucks.
Makes sense.
What I don't like
about the product
is I think tucking,
cropping is a trend,
and I'm worried about
what happens
when it goes the other way,
the trend.
That --
I hope
I'm wrong on that.
I'm out.
Well, thank you so much.
Hi, Sharks. I'm Mark Singer.
And I'm Kenzo Singer.
We're a father-and-son duo
from Santa Barbara,
and are here to ask
for $25,000 for a 5% stake
in our company,
EyeWris.
Sharks, I have a question
for you.
What do sugarless ice cream,
low-salt turkey bacon,
and cheese-free mac and cheese
all have in common?
They were all bought
by mistake
because I didn't have
my reading glasses with me
at the supermarket.
[ Laughter ]
And we had to eat
all that stuff.
Cuban: That's great.
People like my parents
who need reading glasses
know the frustration of not
having their readers with them
when they need them.
[ Laughter ]
But it doesn't always
have to be like that.
Actually, I'm wearing
my reading glasses right now.
With one hand,
in one motion,
and in one second,
EyeWris reading glasses
change from wristwear
to eyewear.
Greiner: Oh, my gosh.
There you go.
And back again.
That's pretty cool.
Corcoran: Wow.
Did y'all catch that?
John: It is cool.
Dad, why don't you show them
one more time.
Using our patented
memory metal bridge design,
EyeWris reading glasses
both spring open and snap shut.
How clever is that?
Greiner: Amazing.
To date,
EyeWris has received
four international
design awards.
Mark:
But more importantly,
EyeWris reading glasses
are fashionable.
[ Laughter ]
So, which of you
is interested in forming
a strategic
partnership...
To share our vision...
And allow the world to see
the power of EyeWris?
Huh.
Sharks, in front of you
are samples for you to try.
Cuban: Best pitch ever.
-Thank you.
-Best pitch ever.
[ Laughter ]
You know,
it's really clever.
Now, I have
a very small wrist,
and it fits.
Are there
different sizes?
Oh, it's only got little
baby stems.
Or is it all one size?
We're starting out with
a universal, one-size-fits-all,
so it should fit
most everyone.
About 95% of the population
is what we're going for.
And you have a patent
on this.
So, I see right there,
it looks like a utility patent.
Mark: That's correct.
We have a utility patent
in the United States,
China, Japan,
and soon to issue
in 26 European countries.
These grippers, do they leave
a mark in your skin
if you're wearing these
for like an hour?
That's
a great question.
I've been wearing them,
sometimes 24/7, for months,
and they may
leave a little bit,
but nothing
that has been bothersome.
They're reading glasses.
They're not long term,
you know,
to keep on your head.
They're meant for
on the go.
Kenzo:
That's exactly right.
These are designed for
the dozens and dozens
of times a day
that you need to take them off,
put them on, check your phone.
One hand, one motion,
one second.
And what do you
sell them for,
what do they cost you
to make?
Greiner: Yeah.
So, they cost us $30.50.
That's landed, in our warehouse,
ready to go.
We sell them for $110 online,
and that includes free shipping.
Are you an inventor?
Yeah, for me,
it was
a need-based product.
As I got older, I needed
reading glasses more and more,
and they were never with me
when I needed them.
I thought the solution was
to buy a dozen pair...
Isn't that the truth?
...and put them
everywhere.
I still didn't have them
when I needed them.
Fortunately,
my son had an eye on me,
and he came up with the --
Are you an engineer?
Yes, I have a bachelor's
and a master's degree
in structural engineering
from Cornell University.
Oh, interesting.
And, Kenzo, how did you come up
with the idea?
How did you figure it out?
I was working as
a structural engineer,
and I designed everything
from skyscrapers
to soccer stadiums,
and thought that,
you know,
"Hey, physics at the scale of
a skyscraper also applies
to something as small
as a pair of reading glasses."
So I just kind of
applied what I knew
to come up
with this mechanism
that's both stable open
and stable closed.
We spent a weekend in
his woodshop prototyping it,
figured it out, and once we got
a working prototype,
we thought,
"Hey, this could work."
And that's when I quit
my engineering job
and did this full-time.
Wow!
Mark, what was your reaction
when your son outwit you?
Wow!
[ Laughter ]
If you think starting
a business is tough,
try doing it
with your kid.
Try doing it with your dad.
Oh, my God.
We just didn't hear
Mark's background.
What's your background?
Well, um, I left home
at about 15 1/2,
barely graduated
high school,
never got out
of college.
I'm mostly
a woodworker.
For over 60 years, I've been
designing and making furniture,
although along the way,
I have started some companies
and brought a number
of products to market,
including one you might
actually be aware of.
Which one was that?
Gorilla Glue.
O'Leary: Oh, wow. Gorilla Glue.
Gorilla Glue?
That's yours?
You're kidding!
Yeah.
Cuban: Gorilla Glue!
I have a bottle of that
back at the hotel
right now.
Corcoran: Wow!
That's what he pastes
his hairpiece with.
[ Laughter ]
John:
And you sold that?
That's a massive
company now.
Yes, I did sell that
years ago.
Excellent. Wow.
Was that a good outcome
for you?
Every company that I've
ever sold has included
a royalty component,
so yes.
[ Corcoran laughs ]
Oh.
So it's worked out
very well.
Oh, you know,
did you say royalty?
I did, sir.
Outstanding.
Wow.
Good man.
So, how many have you sold?
Tell us about your sales.
So, our website technically went
live at the end of last year.
These first nine months
have been a testing
and optimization period,
in terms of our website.
During this
testing period,
we've actually managed to do
about $28,000 in sales.
I know that sounds low,
so let me give you
some context.
Now, the last thing
I wanted to do was
to irresponsibly throw
a bunch of my dad's money
into marketing
in order to pump up our sales
in an inefficient way.
Smart guy.
So we've really only been
spending about $45 a day,
on average, on ads.
And even with
a low sales volume,
we're actually managing
to turn a small profit.
We're only selling direct
on our own website.
Sorry, I just want to ask
how much money you have
in the business.
I put about $630,000 into it.
Whoa!
Wow.
Whoa, that's a lot.
Whoa!
O'Leary: But because
you're a royalty guy,
you don't need the money,
right?
I mean --
Corcoran: 630...
Why do you need a Shark?
Your most valuable commodity
isn't your money.
It's your time.
You can always make more money,
but you can't make more time.
And time gone by
is gone forever.
[ Sniffs ]
[ Chuckles ]
My main reason for being here
is to leave Kenzo in good hands.
And by that,
I mean with successful,
smart, honest, and ethical
people like yourselves.
Wow.
I love you, baby.
I definitely want
to make you an offer,
'cause I'm so impressed
with you.
And, I mean,
it's just...
John: Hey, Kevin, hold on.
Kevin.
What's going on
with Lori?
Mark: Yeah, please, Lori.
I'm okay.
I'm sorry.
What? You all right?
O'Leary: While you're crying,
I'm gonna make an offer.
I'm sorry, that just --
it just really
touched me.
I'm -- You know...
We all have
limited time here,
and it just -- it just
really impacted me,
the way you were saying that,
you know,
you've, like, done your thing
and that you just want
to make sure
that your family's okay.
Um, it -- it just got me.
So, forgive me.
Um...
Listen, I just want
to make you an offer.
I'd like to offer you
$25,000 for 10%.
I know this business.
I know what it takes.
I've done millions of dollars
in sunglasses and readers,
and I think that
this was pretty ingenious.
It's great quality,
and I can put my heart
and soul behind it,
but it'll take work.
And I'd just like to take
the journey with you.
Thank you, Lori.
Really appreciate it.
O'Leary: I would also like
to make an offer.
I know how
to blow this up huge,
and I'm gonna give you
$50,000 for 10%.
This is an extraordinary
situation.
There's no question about it.
It's such a simple product
to demonstrate.
It's going to work
so well on social.
Cuban: But, guys,
I have a strong sense...
But he doesn't have the
experience that I have.
...that this is not about
the cash coming in.
So now we turn it
back to you.
What is it that you truly want?
We understand the goal,
but what is your
decision-making criteria?
So, yeah, you know,
we have the design done,
we have the patents,
we have new products coming out.
What we don't have
is the know-how
for how to best
get it out there.
I have that.
I've done this.
I've walked this lane.
Corcoran: But who would
you rather leave --
Who would you rather have
as a mentor for your son --
Lori or Kevin?
Cuban: Or all of --
Or multiple or whatever.
That's where I'm trying
to get to, right?
Because you have
a lot of flexibility.
All the leverage
turns back to you,
because we all know
this is a great deal,
and we all know
we can help you sell more.
There's three
components --
retail and online
and licensing the technology
for wearable --
for wearable tech.
That's your big play.
Yeah, that's your big play.
John: I think it's
a sports play, as well.
And I've been here
14 years.
Lori is one of
the smartest people...
Thank you.
...that I've ever met
in my life.
I'll double
whatever she has,
if she allows me
in the deal.
I'd be happy to work
with Daymond.
He's absolutely brilliant
in the licensing field.
10% is too much, Lori.
We're essentially
giving away the equity
for what you guys bring,
which is to some extent
invaluable.
So you don't want to give away
as much equity.
Two of you --
That's correct.
Well, Mark,
let me ask you a question.
Would you consider
giving more?
It sounds like
what you're saying is
you don't want
to go past 5%,
but if you got three Sharks,
would you give up 10%?
Yes.
Let's do that deal.
I want in this deal, too.
I'd love to be in the deal,
too, obviously.
Well, I don't
want to be left out.
What would you give up
for all the Sharks,
if we all want
in this deal?
and they are all interested
in Mark and Kenzo's
innovative reading glasses
company, EyeWris.
Mark and Kenzo, what would
you do for all five Sharks?
What would you part with?
What would work for you guys
if, heaven forbid,
all five of you could work --
would work together?
You know, the way multi-Shark
deals typically work,
someone does the due diligence,
and then we all figure out
what our skill sets are,
and then we contribute those.
Okay, guys, why don't you step
into the hall so the Sharks
can talk this over,
you can talk it over...
[ Greiner laughs ]
...and we'll do some work here.
So, give us one second.
-Okay, so we'll...
-Thank you.
So what I'll suggest is really,
really simple, right?
It's not the cash. He's got
all the cash he needs, right?
Yeah, it's not the cash.
It's the aggregate equity.
Wow.
Unbelievable.
Okay. Um...
So what are you thinking,
percentage?
I don't think that we should
go more than 15%.
Let them work it out.
15%.
We all love this deal.
What's important is putting
yourself in their shoes, right?
Yes, that's right.
So, we can come in
and say, right,
"So, Lori can get 7%.
I'll take 3%."
You schmoes can take 5%,
right?
That's fine, right?
That's a total of 25%.
Greiner: Thanks, Mark.
And then what
we come back is
we each give $25,000,
because --
There's only one problem.
He has never said
he'd even entertain 25%.
Well, we're gonna find out.
He didn't say no.
It's...unexpected.
Unexpected.
Unexpected.
We didn't even prepare
for this one.
No, we didn't.
Mark, Kenzo,
come back to the Tank.
[ Kenzo exhales sharply ]
Kenzo: Couldn't be happier.
Couldn't be prouder of my dad.
My dad's never -- I've never
seen him get emotional like that
and seen my dad really speak
from his heart.
Yeah, it made the moment
pretty special.
Unbelievable.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God.
Dad --
I don't know what to say.
[ Both laugh ]
