Hello.
My name is Ashley Jones,
and I'm from
Virginia Beach, Virginia.

I'm the owner
of Tones of Melanin.
T.O.M.!
I'm seeking $300,000
for 5% equity into my business.
Hello.
So, Sharks, for years,
thousands of students,
faculty, and alumni
from historically Black
colleges and universities,
also known as HBCUs,
have been underrepresented
when it comes to fashion.
They're tired of
bedazzled T-shirts and polos
being their only option
for years.
Tones of Melanin is here
to fill that void.
Tones of Melanin
has combined streetwear
and collegiate wear
together
to create
its own genre of fashion.
To date, we have over
40 different HBCU licenses.
What makes us so unique
is that we come
from the community
that we serve.
Tones of Melanin has become
bigger than just fashion.
We've become the hub
for all things HBCU.
So, Sharks, who's ready to
change collegiate wear forever?
Give it up for my band!

Greiner: Whoo.

Ashley, I have to
ask you this.
I mean, your enthusiasm,
your confidence is...
It's amazing.
...huge...
Thank you.
...and amazing.
Can you please tell us
a bit more about your story?
Like, where did this
come from?
My grandparents had
one of the first
African-American beauty supply
companies in our area,
so I've seen
entrepreneurship firsthand.
And then,
when I turned 13,
my mom worked for
the Ford Company subsidiary,
they left Norfolk, Virginia.
So I went into hustle mode,
and it was like,
"I could at least pay for me
to go pay for lunch for myself,
I can pay to get my hair done."
So it just became second nature,
to be honest.
You had to take care
of you.
Yes, yes. And it wasn't --
my mom never asked this,
I just wanted to help.
Like, "I know I can do this
for myself,"
like, "I can handle this.
You don't worry
about that, Mom."
You're hot stuff --
You're killing it, Ashley.
My God.
Ashley, you've gotta be
putting money
in your pocket right now.
Not yet.
You're investing in inventory
continuously?
Everything is going right back
into the business.
You're not
making a salary?
You don't pay yourself
anything?
I pay myself
next to nothing.
I'm still trying to get --
How are you surviving?
I have a great community.
My family, my mom,
she believes in me.
That is really
mind-blowing.
Problem for me --
I don't know much at all
about this area.
I am not really
and never have really been
much in the apparel world,
nor in the sports...
I understand.
Greiner:
It's not really my thing.
And so,
for that reason,
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
You are on fire.
Thank you.
But this isn't a business
I know a thing about.
Sadly, I'm out.
Ashley, I look at it
as a inventory challenge,
because
the bigger you get,
the more capital
you're gonna need
to hold all these
different SKUs,
and more licenses, more SKUs,
more inventory, more capital.
That's what I've learned about
the clothing business.
It's not a business
I want to be in.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.
The challenge I have
is I'm in this area
in certain aspects.
I either advise or own
companies in this area,
Eastman Golf
and Actively Black, FUBU,
and then another company
you may know of, AACA,
African-American Colleges --
Okay, yes, yes, I'm familiar.
So it would be challenging
for me to split hairs like this,
and I don't think I would be
giving you -- doing a service.
But I will
give you one idea.
Instead of having -- trying to
go to a lot of retailers,
we've had one
representative young man
and one representative
young woman at each school
who are the official sellers
of the goods,
and they get maybe $1,000,
$2,000 worth of product,
and sell it
however they want,
and they've been doing it
like that.
I would highly suggest
you do that.
But at this moment,
it's a conflict for me.
So, yeah, congratulations.
I appreciate your advice.
Thank you.
Absolutely. I'm out.
Thank you.
So, Ashley,
you're a superstar,
you're a force of nature.
You know your stuff cold.
I mean,
you didn't back down.
You kept a smile
the whole time.
Nobody fazed you
even the tiniest bit.
And, you know, being
in the business I am
with the Mavericks,
I know a few people that,
you know,
are excited about all this.
So I'll make you an offer.
Okay.
We'll see if you like it.
I'll give you the $300,000,
but I want 15%.
Can we do 12%?
Done.
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: Wow.
John:
That was quick.
Good job!
You're the best.
Thank you.
You're the best.
Thank you.
That's awesome.
I'm so excited.
Congrats.
Thank you.
Excited, excited, excited.
Thank you.
Now go sell some stuff.
[ Laughs ]
Yes, absolutely.
Make me some money.
Jones: I made a deal
with Mark Cuban,
like, one of the biggest Sharks
there is.
I provide a beacon of hope.
If I made it
and I went to an HBCU,
I'm providing the sense of hope
for anybody
that attended an HBCU.
