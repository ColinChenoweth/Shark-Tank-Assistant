Hello.
My name is Ashley Jones,
Ashley, I have to
ask you this.
I mean, your enthusiasm,
your confidence is...
It's amazing.
...huge...
You're hot stuff --
You're killing it, Ashley.
My God.
Ashley, you've gotta be
putting money
in your pocket right now.
Not yet.
You're investing in inventory
continuously?
Everything is going right back
into the business.
You're not
making a salary?
You don't pay yourself
anything?
I pay myself
next to nothing.
I'm still trying to get --
How are you surviving?
I have a great community.
My family, my mom,
she believes in me.
That is really
mind-blowing.
Problem for me --
I don't know much at all
about this area.
Ashley, I look at it
as a inventory challenge,
because
the bigger you get,
the more capital
you're gonna need
to hold all these
different SKUs,
Thank you.
So, Ashley,
you're a superstar,
you're a force of nature.
You know your stuff cold.
I mean,
you didn't back down.
You kept a smile
the whole time.
Nobody fazed you
even the tiniest bit.
Jones: I made a deal
with Mark Cuban,
like, one of the biggest Sharks
there is.
I provide a beacon of hope.
