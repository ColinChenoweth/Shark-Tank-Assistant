MY NAME IS JONATHAN BOOS,
JONATHAN, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
OH, YEAH.
I?I AM THE REAL DEAL.
JONATHAN, WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
TODAY IN ALL THE PRODUCTS?
THE OTHER DAY??TODAY
I'M AT A HALF MILLION.
I'M EXPECTING $1.8 MILLION
NEXT YEAR.
$1.8 MILLION? WOW.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE $85,000?
DAYMOND,
OUT OF ANYBODY HERE,
YOU SHOULD KNOW??
WHAT CAN I DO WITH $85,000?
I MEAN, TO REALLY TAKE
THIS BRAND TO THE NEXT LEVEL,
I NEED TO GET SOMEONE THAT KNOWS
WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING
TO GET ME THERE,
SO I CAN CONTINUE TO CREATE.
I'VE GOT PRODUCTS
ON THE DRAWING BOARD.
I'VE GOT PRODUCTS RIGHT NOW
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
JONATHAN,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
OKAY. OKAY.
I LOVE YOUR PASSION. I LOVE YOUR
KNOWLEDGE. I LOVE YOUR APPROACH.
I'M WAITING FOR THE "BUT."
YEAH, THERE'S A "BUT" COMING.
I'M NOT THE GUY
WITH THE CONNECTIONS.
I'M NOT THE GUY
WHO ADDS VALUE.
I'M JUST NOT THE GUY
TO HELP YOU. I'M OUT.
JONATHAN, I JUST??I REALLY CAN'T
DO ANYTHING FOR YOUR BUSINESS...
OKAY.
SO I'M OUT.
THE GUY THAT'S STAYING
THE MOST QUIET IS THE ONE
THAT CAN HELP ME THE MOST,
BUT HE'S STAYING QUIET.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I WANT A ROYALTY
ON THAT MONEY.
I WANT A 14% ROYALTY.
SO IT'S LIKE A LOAN.
NO. I'M GETTING A TON OF EQUITY,
TOO. I WANT 30% OF THE COMPANY.
IT'S A LOAN, RIGHT?
NO, IT'S NOT A LOAN.
ROBERT'S GIVING ME THE EYE
THAT IT'S A LOAN.
(laughs)
WELL, YOU'RE PAYING 14%
OFF THE TOP. I MEAN...
YOU KNOW, I LOVE ROBERT.
HE LOVES TO GIVE??
I LOVE ROBERT, TOO!
ROBERT GIVES YOU THE EYE,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. IN THE END,
YOU NEED CASH, MY FRIEND.
I'M MAKING YOU AN OFFER.
NEVER DISRESPECT THE CASH.
DON'T LIKE THAT DEAL.
YOU KNOW WHY I LIKE THAT DEAL?
BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH.
YOU'RE GONNA BE CALLING ME
EVERY 90 DAYS FOR
A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS.
JONATHAN, YOU'VE ABSOLUTELY
PISSED HIM OFF.
TO CLARIFY WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO TELL YOU
WAS THE REASON THAT
YOU WILL BE WEALTHY
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THOUGHTS OF HIGH VALUE.
I WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU
A COMPLIMENT.
OKAY.
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO TALK,
I COULD NOT SPEAK TO YOU.
YOU TOOK FOREVER.
I'M??I'M WAITING FOR??
(laughter)
(Jonathan) I'M JUST SAYING...
BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
THEN I'LL
STOP TALKING. OKAY.
JONATHAN, IT'S NOT THE FIRST
TIME YOU'VE HEARD THAT, IS IT?
"NO"? OH, YEAH. I WOULDN'T BE
HERE IF I TOOK NO FOR AN ANSWER.
NEXT.
I'M ACTUALLY UPSET.
YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE I LIKE IT.
JONATHAN, DO YOU WANT
MY $100,000 OR NOT?
DO YOU WANT
MY $100,000 OR NOT?
JONATHAN,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000
FOR 30%, NO ROYALTY.
WOULD YOU GO $200,000
FOR 30%?
WAIT A SECOND. I'LL DROP
MY EQUITY ASSET DOWN.
$100,000 FOR 20%, BUT I WANT
THE ROYALTY TO STAY IN PLACE.
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN
WHAT HE WANTS. HE'S A SAVAGE.
HE'S ASKING FOR
A <i>THIRD</i> OF YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU'RE A VULTURE!
(Mark laughs)
BECAUSE, I MEAN, I SHOULD
BE GETTING THE ROYALTY HERE.
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE
THAT'S CREATING THE STUFF.
JONATHAN, I'LL GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 25%.
UH, THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
(Barbara) ONE MORE THING.
I'M GONNA GO BACK IN.
BARBARA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YEAH.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 20%,
PROVIDED DAYMOND FORGIVES YOU.
JONATHAN, COME BACK TO DADDY!
(Robert laughs)
COME BACK TO DADDY!
I'M PUTTING A DIFFERENCE
OF ONLY 15% DUE TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
OKAY, I'LL DROP
MY EQUITY ASSET DOWN TO 15%,
BUT THE ROYALTY
STAYS IN PLACE.
JONATHAN, JONATHAN.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW.
(Barbara)
AW, THAT'S A HAPPY ENDING.
(Jonathan) THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DEAL WITH
CREATIVE GUYS LIKE DESIGNERS.
YOU WILL NEVER GET A WORD IN,
