MY NAME IS JONATHAN BOOS,
AND I'M THE OWNER OF
THE MEN'S BRAND WURKIN STIFFS,
AS WELL AS THE INVENTOR
OF POWER STAYS,
THE WORLD'S ONLY
MAGNETIC COLLAR STAYS.
I'M SEEKING $85,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
NOW THIS ALL STARTED BACK
WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING LATE
FOR SOME DINNER RESERVATIONS.
MY WIFE WAS YELLING AS SHE THREW
A BRAND?NEW SHIRT AT ME
TO PUT ON, AND I'D SEEN
THAT I HAD A?A BIG PROBLEM.
I LOOKED LIKE JOHN TRAVOLTA
FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER."
THE COLLAR WAS ALL LARGE
AND IN CHARGE,
AND I COULDN'T CONTROL
THIS THING,
SO I FOUND
SOME ORDINARY PAPER CLIPS,
AND I FOUND SOME MAGNETS,
AND I MADE THE VERY FIRST
MAGNETIC COLLAR STAY.
I HAVEN'T WORN A SHIRT
THE SAME SINCE.
SO FIRST YOU TAKE
OUR POWER STAY...
AND YOU PLACE IT ON
THE UNDERSIDE OF THE COLLAR.
THERE'S A COLLAR STAY POCKET.
FLIP THE COLLAR DOWN,
AND WE HAVE
A SUPERSTRONG, SMALL MAGNET,
AND THIS GOES ON THE INSIDE
OF THE SHIRT...
AND INSTANTLY CHANGED
MY SHIRT
INTO
A HIDDEN BUTTON?DOWN COLLAR.
SO WHEREVER YOU PUT
YOUR COLLAR
IS WHERE YOUR COLLAR STAYS.
AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE
THIS IN THE MENSWEAR INDUSTRY.
THESE ARE SPECTACULAR.
THANK YOU. WE KNEW WE HAD
SOMETHING PRETTY SPECIAL
WHEN WE ACQUIRED THREE
HIGH?END MEN'S SPECIALTY STORES.
WHAT RETAILERS
DO YOU SELL THEM IN?
NORDSTROM CONTACTED US. WE DID
A TEST OF OUR POWER STAYS,
WHICH LAUNCHED IN 24 STORES.
WITHIN 3 MONTHS,
WE WENT TO 77 STORES.
WE HAD SOLD
OVER 18,000 UNITS.
WE MADE THEM
OVER $600,000 RETAIL.
WE'RE CURRENTLY IN
ALL 115 NORDSTROM STORES.
JONATHAN, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
OH, YEAH.
I?I AM THE REAL DEAL.
I DESIGN AND PRODUCE
ALL THIS STUFF MYSELF.
THE PACKAGING, THE DISPLAYS,
THE PRODUCT??IT'S ALL ME.
JONATHAN, WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
TODAY IN ALL THE PRODUCTS?
THE OTHER DAY??TODAY
I'M AT A HALF MILLION.
I'M EXPECTING $1.8 MILLION
NEXT YEAR.
$1.8 MILLION? WOW.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE $85,000?
DAYMOND,
OUT OF ANYBODY HERE,
YOU SHOULD KNOW??
WHAT CAN I DO WITH $85,000?
I MEAN, TO REALLY TAKE
THIS BRAND TO THE NEXT LEVEL,
I NEED TO GET SOMEONE THAT KNOWS
WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING
TO GET ME THERE,
SO I CAN CONTINUE TO CREATE.
I'VE GOT PRODUCTS
ON THE DRAWING BOARD.
I'VE GOT PRODUCTS RIGHT NOW
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
JONATHAN,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
OKAY. OKAY.
I LOVE YOUR PASSION. I LOVE YOUR
KNOWLEDGE. I LOVE YOUR APPROACH.
I'M WAITING FOR THE "BUT."
YEAH, THERE'S A "BUT" COMING.
I'M NOT THE GUY
WITH THE CONNECTIONS.
I'M NOT THE GUY
WHO ADDS VALUE.
I'M JUST NOT THE GUY
TO HELP YOU. I'M OUT.
JONATHAN, I JUST??I REALLY CAN'T
DO ANYTHING FOR YOUR BUSINESS...
OKAY.
SO I'M OUT.
THE GUY THAT'S STAYING
THE MOST QUIET IS THE ONE
THAT CAN HELP ME THE MOST,
BUT HE'S STAYING QUIET.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I WANT A ROYALTY
ON THAT MONEY.
I WANT A 14% ROYALTY.
SO IT'S LIKE A LOAN.
NO. I'M GETTING A TON OF EQUITY,
TOO. I WANT 30% OF THE COMPANY.
IT'S A LOAN, RIGHT?
NO, IT'S NOT A LOAN.
ROBERT'S GIVING ME THE EYE
THAT IT'S A LOAN.
(laughs)
WELL, YOU'RE PAYING 14%
OFF THE TOP. I MEAN...
YOU KNOW, I LOVE ROBERT.
HE LOVES TO GIVE??
I LOVE ROBERT, TOO!
ROBERT GIVES YOU THE EYE,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. IN THE END,
YOU NEED CASH, MY FRIEND.
I'M MAKING YOU AN OFFER.
NEVER DISRESPECT THE CASH.
DON'T LIKE THAT DEAL.
YOU KNOW WHY I LIKE THAT DEAL?
BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH.
YOU'RE GONNA BE CALLING ME
EVERY 90 DAYS FOR
A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS.
AND IF THINGS ARE GOING WELL,
I'LL KEEP DOING IT.
BUT NOT??NOT AT??YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, RIGHT, EXACTLY.
ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE AN OFFER.
THAT'S ON THE TABLE.
GREAT. ANYONE ELSE?
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE HIS OFFER?
I NEED MORE THAN MONEY.
I NEED SOMEONE THAT CAN HELP ME.
DAYMOND, YOU??YOU SOLD HATS.
ONE PRODUCT, RIGHT? AND THEN YOU
CREATED THIS EMPIRE OF A BRAND.
(Robert) OOH.
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I CAN'T MAKE THIS
INTO A SUCCESSFUL BRAND.
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T GET.
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
INTO A SUCCESSFUL BRAND.
I??
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL
HAVE THOUGHTS OF HIGH VALUE,
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
HAVE THOUGHTS OF LOW VALUE,
SO YOU'RE VALUING YOURSELF
HIGH??
HOW AM I VALUING MYSELF HIGH?
85 THOUS??
YOU SHOULD BE, BUT IF YOU'RE
GONNA ARGUE WITH ME...
ALL RIGHT.
THEN I DON'T WANT A PARTNER
WHO'S GONNA ARGUE WITH ME...
I'M NOT??I'M??DAYMOND...
SO JUST??BECAUSE OF THAT...
YOU, OUT OF ANYBODY, SHOULD
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M DOING.
I MEAN, I DON'T??
I DON'T GET IT.
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA THROW
AN OFFER ON THE TABLE??
NOW HE'S GONNA SAY
BECAUSE I WAS ARGUING...
(Barbara) LET DAYMOND TALK.
YOU SEE HIS HAND RIGHT THERE?
I STILL AM NOT DONE TALKING.
I'M OUT.
I?I KNEW IT.
JONATHAN, YOU'VE ABSOLUTELY
PISSED HIM OFF.
TO CLARIFY WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO TELL YOU
WAS THE REASON THAT
YOU WILL BE WEALTHY
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THOUGHTS OF HIGH VALUE.
I WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU
A COMPLIMENT.
OKAY.
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO TALK,
I COULD NOT SPEAK TO YOU.
YOU TOOK FOREVER.
I'M??I'M WAITING FOR??
(laughter)
(Jonathan) I'M JUST SAYING...
BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
I'M SORRY. AND I'M SORRY, AND I
WILL NEVER TAKE FOREVER AGAIN,
BECAUSE I WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU AN OFFER,
AND YOU BOTCHED THE OFFER.
OH, WHAT A BABY.
MY GOD.
YOU WANT ME TO GET ON
THE PHONE WITH HIM EVERY DAY?
"HEY, CAN I TALK TO..."
(imitates babbling) "CLICK."
I'LL PUT IT IN THE CONTRACT
I'LL NEVER CALL YOU AGAIN.
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
(laughter)
I CANNOT STAND PARTNERS
THAT I CAN'T EVEN SPEAK TO.
IF HE WOULD HAVE SHUT UP,
HE WOULD HAVE HAD AN OFFER.
I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE, FOR REAL.
I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO COME OFF THAT WAY. IF I'VE
OFFENDED YOU IN ANY WAY...
YOU DID NOT OFFEN??
THEN I WOULD DO
NOTHING DIFFERENT.
YOU DID NOT OFFEND ME.
I'M NOT OFFENDED.
MY FEELINGS AREN'T HURT??
I'M??I'M JUST??
I THINK YOU'RE MISSING OUT
ON A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
(Barbara) COME ON, DAYMOND.
YOU'RE SUCH A BABY. CUT IT OUT.
LISTEN, BARB.
I HAVE PET PEEVES. YOU DO.
IF THIS IS A PET PEEVE,
GET OVER IT.
WOW, YOU REALLY HURT
HIS FEELINGS, JONATHAN.
LET ME TALK TO ROBERT,
MY LAST CHANCE, AND THEN??
AND THEN??SIT THERE AND JUST
THINK ABOUT IT. I'M A NICE GUY.
THEN I'LL
STOP TALKING. OKAY.
JONATHAN, IT'S NOT THE FIRST
TIME YOU'VE HEARD THAT, IS IT?
"NO"? OH, YEAH. I WOULDN'T BE
HERE IF I TOOK NO FOR AN ANSWER.
NEXT.
I'M ACTUALLY UPSET.
YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE I LIKE IT.
WELL, AND I LIKE...
WHATEVER.
SEE? (high?pitched voice)
"WHATEVER."
I MEAN??NO, I WOULD
TALK TO YOU, BUT YOU??
"YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
WE SHOULD DO WITH THE COMP??"
(high?pitched voice)
"WHATEVER."
NO, NO, NOT WHATEVER. DAYMOND,
I'M HERE TO... ALL RIGHT.
DAYMOND, HE'S NERVOUS.
HE'S A HIGH?ENERGY GUY.
WHY DON'T YOU CUT HIM
A LITTLE SLACK?
WHY DON'T <i>YOU</i> CUT HIM A CHECK?
THIS IS ALL WONDERFUL. LET'S
HOLD HANDS AND SAY "KUMBAYA."
JONATHAN, DO YOU WANT
MY $100,000 OR NOT?
DO YOU WANT
MY $100,000 OR NOT?
JONATHAN,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000
FOR 30%, NO ROYALTY.
WOULD YOU GO $200,000
FOR 30%?
WAIT A SECOND. I'LL DROP
MY EQUITY ASSET DOWN.
$100,000 FOR 20%, BUT I WANT
THE ROYALTY TO STAY IN PLACE.
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN
WHAT HE WANTS. HE'S A SAVAGE.
HE'S ASKING FOR
A <i>THIRD</i> OF YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU'RE A VULTURE!
(Mark laughs)
BECAUSE, I MEAN, I SHOULD
BE GETTING THE ROYALTY HERE.
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE
THAT'S CREATING THE STUFF.
JONATHAN, I'LL GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 25%.
UH, THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
(Barbara) ONE MORE THING.
I'M GONNA GO BACK IN.
BARBARA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YEAH.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 20%,
PROVIDED DAYMOND FORGIVES YOU.
AND I'LL BE
YOUR FRONT MAN, DAYMOND.
YOU NEVER HAVE TO TALK TO THIS
GUY. YOU JUST ENJOY HIS SUCCESS.
AND YOU KNOW
I'M A GREAT FRONT MAN.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
OH, DAYMOND.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH PERCENTAGE
ON THE COMPANY.
WHAT??SO WHAT IS IT?
YOU WANT TO MATCH HIS AT 25%?
CAN'T TAKE LESS THAN 40%.
(O'Leary) WHOO!
(Robert) OH, MY...
WOW.
JONATHAN, COME BACK TO DADDY!
(Robert laughs)
COME BACK TO DADDY!
I'M PUTTING A DIFFERENCE
OF ONLY 15% DUE TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
OKAY, I'LL DROP
MY EQUITY ASSET DOWN TO 15%,
BUT THE ROYALTY
STAYS IN PLACE.
WOULD??WOULD DAYMOND AND BARBARA
BE WILLING TO DO 30%...
THE $100,000 FOR 30% EQUITY?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THE OFFER'S A HARD OFFER.
JONATHAN, JONATHAN.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION NOW.
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO DO A DEAL
WITH BARBARA AND DAYMOND.
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
(Barbara)
AW, THAT'S A HAPPY ENDING.
(Jonathan) THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DEAL WITH
CREATIVE GUYS LIKE DESIGNERS.
YOU WILL NEVER GET A WORD IN,
AND YOU'LL NEVER
GET ANYTHING DONE.
YOU WERE SPANKING HIM
LIKE A BABY SEAL.
(laughs)
I ALMOST BLEW THE DEAL WITH
DAYMOND BECAUSE OF MY BIG MOUTH.
BARBARA, LOVE YA.
THANK YOU
FOR GETTING THAT HOOK OUT
AND GETTING DAYMOND BACK
INTO THE GAME. APPRECIATE IT.
