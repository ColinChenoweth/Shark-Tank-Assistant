HI.
MY NAME IS SARAH NUSE...
AND I'M HER SISTER,
MEGAN REILLY.
AND WE ARE SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $30,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 5% STAKE OF OUR CHILDREN'S
DANCE COMPANY, TIPPI TOES.
ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN
IN AMERICA ARE OBESE,
AND 80% OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
HAVE CUT RECESS.
OUR FUN, KID?FRIENDLY,
HIGH?ENERGY DANCING AND MUSIC
GETS THE KIDS MOVING AND FEELING
GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.
OKAY, KIDS, YOU READY
TO DO SOME DANCING?
READY!
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
? I LOVE TIPPI TOES ?
? AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT'S RIGHT ?
(Megan) YAY! YOU GUYS DID SUCH
A GOOD JOB! THAT WAS PERFECT!
(Barbara) MORE, MORE.
(Mark) YAY.
NOW WE NEED YOU GUYS
TO DANCE YOUR WAY OUT OF HERE
BEFORE ONE OF THESE SHARKS
TRY TO BITE YOU. SAY GOOD?BYE!
(Robert) GOOD JOB, GUYS.
BYE!
(laughter)
AS A FORMER
PROFESSIONAL DANCER MYSELF,
AND MEGAN BEING
A REGISTERED DIETICIAN,
WE FOCUS OUR BUSINESS
ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,
HEALTHY HABITS,
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
THE KIDS HAVING FUN.
AND IN 2009, WE BEGAN
FRANCHISING OUR BUSINESS
SO WE COULD REACH
AS MANY KIDS AS POSSIBLE.
AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE
KEEP HAVING BABIES,
WE'RE ALWAYS
GONNA HAVE CUSTOMERS.
NOW WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
IS READY TO INVEST IN US?
YOU SAID YOU SOLD 70 FRANCHISES?
DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT?
IT'S $30,000 TO GET IN.
OUR VISION IS
THE STAY?AT?HOME MOM.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT TIPPI TOES
IS WE GO INTO PRESCHOOLS,
AFTER?SCHOOL ACTIVITIES,
UM, DAY CARE,
SO WE DON'T HAVE
OVERHEAD OF A FACILITY,
SO IT'S A LOW ENTRY COST,
AND THEN, THEY PAY
A MONTHLY ROYALTY FEE TO US.
SARAH, $30,000 ISN'T THAT LOW.
WHAT DO I GET FOR THAT $30,000?
$30,000??
WE CREATED OUR OWN MUSIC.
WE HAVE, UM, OUR FIRST CD,
"TIPPI'S TUNES"??
THAT'S A LESSON PLAN. UM,
WE GO OUT AND DO THE BUSINESS,
THE SALES AND MARKETING
FOR THEM, THEY GET OUR??
SO I GIVE YOU $30,000,
YOU GIVE ME A CD,
AND I GET PICTURES
OF THE INSECTS?
THEY'RE NOT INSECTS. THEY'RE
ADORABLE LITTLE CREATURES.
SO RATHER THAN TAKING THEM
TO DANCE CLASS SOMEWHERE ELSE...
CORRECT.
YOU'RE??YOU HAVE A LICENSEE
WHO SAYS TO MY KID'S PRESCHOOL,
"YOU KEEP THE KIDS THERE."
MM?HMM.
RIGHT? I'M GONNA CHARGE
THE PARENTS INDEPENDENTLY.
THE PRESCHOOL OR SCHOOL IS JUST
GONNA LET ME USE THE FACILITIES
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
A GOOD THING FOR THEM TO DO
TO KEEP THEIR KIDS THERE...
YEAH, EXACTLY.
AND THEN IT'S A WIN?WIN.
IT'S VERY CLEVER. HOW MUCH MONEY
DOES YOUR COMPANY MAKE TODAY?
LAST YEAR WE MADE $268,000.
AND WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT?
OUR PROFIT WAS $29,000.
THE $30,000 THEY HAVE TO PAY
FOR THE FRANCHISE...
CORRECT.
WHERE DO PEOPLE GET THAT MONEY?
UM, A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS WE'VE DONE IT IN?HOUSE, WHERE
WE'LL FINANCE IT OUT FOR 'EM.
THEN, WE CAN MAKE MONEY
OFF THEIR INTEREST, WHICH??
SO, YOU MEAN THEY OWE YOU
THE $30,000...
CORRECT.
AND THEN YOU START CHAR??
LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
YOU <i>ARE</i> SHARKS.
YOU MARCH INTO SOMEBODY
AND YOU SELL THEM
$30,000 WORTH OF LIABILITY THEY
START PAYING YOU INTEREST ON
'CAUSE THEY HAVEN'T
FUNDED IT YET.
FORGET THIS. COME AND WORK
FOR ME AT O'LEARY FUNDS.
(laughter)
I CAN MAKE YOU
SOME REAL MONEY.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE <i>YOU</i>
SOME REAL MONEY.
WHAT'S PROPRIETARY ABOUT THIS?
WHY CAN'T I??
DOESN'T MATTER.
<i>THEY'RE</i> PROPRIETARY ABOUT THIS.
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TRIED THIS.
PEOPLE HEARD ABOUT US.
THEY MAKE UP A NAME
THAT'S NOT NEARLY, OF COURSE,
AS CUTE AS "TIPPI TOES."
YEAH, "UNCLE KEVIN'S
WACKY FEET."
EXACTLY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE THIS PASSION,
YOU DON'T HAVE THIS DRIVE,
YOU AREN'T THIS GOOD WITH KIDS.
WE HAVE IT.
I MEAN, I?I'M ABSOLUTELY
BLOWN AWAY YOU'VE GOT
A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS
OF SALES, 'CAUSE THIS STUFF??
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT PROVES,
KEVIN? WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF HARD WORK, A LITTLE BIT
OF PASSION, AND A LITTLE BIT
OF VISION, YOU CAN??
YOU CAN HAVE A REAL BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE SO MANY
PARENTS COME TO US WHO SAY,
"WE DID DANCE SOMEPLACE ELSE.
THIS IS LIKE NOTHING ELSE
WE'VE EVER SEEN."
WHAT'S YOUR ONGOING ROYALTY
THAT YOU'RE EARNING BACK
FROM THE??THE FRANCHISEE?
THERE'S A MINIMUM ROYALTY
PAYMENT EACH MONTH, SO??
TELL ME WHAT
YOUR MINIMUM ROYALTY IS.
IT'S $1,000 EACH MONTH.
WHA??ARE YOU ACTUALLY??
I CAN'T <i>BELIEVE</i> THIS!
SEE, KEVIN?
THESE GUYS ARE GOOD!
THESE GUYS ARE GOOD,
I'M TELLING YOU.
THAT'S $42,000. (laughs)
I CAN'T <i>BELIEVE</i> PEOPLE GIVE YOU
$30,000 FOR THESE INSECTS!
THESE GUYS ARE LIKE
EXTORTIONISTS WITH TUTUS ON.
I LOVE 'EM.
(laughs)
YOU ASKED FOR $30,000 FOR 5%.
MM?HMM.
TALK TO ME
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
WHY THIS BUSINESS
IS WORTH $600,000.
WE WALKED IN THE DOORS
A FEW MINUTES AGO.
SINCE THEN, WE HAVE
MORE KIDS IN "TIPPI TOES,"
SO WE ARE GROWING
AT A RAPID PACE.
(chuckles)
LOVE THAT ATTITUDE.
AND WHY ARE YOU
ONLY GIVING US 5%?
IF YOU WANT MORE,
NEGOTIATE WITH US.
(Mark and Barbara laugh)
BOY, THAT'S GREAT.
ARE THESE DVDs OR CDs?
THESE ARE CDs THAT WE HAVE
HERE. WE HOPE TO DO DVDs.
SO YOU HAVEN'T
PRODUCED THE DVDs YET?
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE??TODAY.
OH, I SEE.
OH, WOW.
BUT GUYS, GUYS, WHY? YOU KNOW,
WHY GET INTO THE DVD BUSINESS,
WHEREAS, YOU MIGHT MAKE, $5 TO
$10 A DVD IF YOU'RE LUCKY.
THAT'S WHERE??
THAT'S OUR VISION.
IT'S DOWN THE R??WE'RE BUILDING
A BRAND. WE'RE BUILDING A BRAND.
IS THAT WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH IT?
(Megan) THAT'S WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH IT. LONG?TERM.
OUR BIG DREAM IS TO HAVE
THE NEXT BARNEY.
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
SELLING THEM ANYTHING
EXCEPT YOUR SMILING FACES.
(laughs) I HOPE YOU SEE MORE
BEHIND IT THAN THAT.
I DON'T, ACTUALLY.
THE REST OF US DO,
BUT DON'T WORRY, GUYS.
IF YOU KEEP ON GOING
LIKE YOU ARE,
HE'LL NEED A JOB,
AND YOU CAN HIRE HIM.
YES, YES. THAT'LL WORK.
GUYS, YOU DON'T NEED ME,
BUT YOU ARE GREAT EXTORTIONISTS.
UM, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
DO WELL. I'M OUT.
HAVE ANY OF THE PEOPLE
YOU SIGNED UP QUIT?
AS FAR AS FRANCHISEES?
YEAH.
(both) NO.
AND HOW LONG IS
THE??THE, UH...
TEN YEARS.
TEN YEARS. REALLY? OKAY.
MM?HMM. MM?HMM. AND THEN,
AT THE END OF 10 YEARS??
IT'S A 10?YEAR COMMITMENT?
AT THE END OF TEN YEARS,
THEIR BUSINESS IS THRIVING.
WOW.
THEY SIGN ANOTHER...
(O'Leary laughs)
THIS IS UN??THIS IS UNREAL.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO
APPLAUD THEM OR CALL THE POLICE.
(laughs)
THEY'RE DOING
THE HARDEST THING IN THE WORLD
FOR ANY SMALL BUSINESS.
THEY'RE EXECUTING ON THEIR IDEA.
HOW DO YOU STOP THEM FROM
FOLLOWING THE DVD DEAL?
HOW DO YOU STOP THEM
FROM DOING THAT?
WELL, THEN,
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE, RIGHT?
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
TOO FAR AHEAD OF YOURSELF...
SURE.
OKAY.
'CAUSE THAT'S
HOW YOU SCREW UP.
SARAH, IT'S FANTASTIC, BUT YOU
GOT TO GROW ONE STEP AT A TIME.
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T BUILD
A GREAT BUSINESS OVERNIGHT,
AND I THINK YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO TAKE TOO BIG A LEAP. I'M OUT.
I CAN'T GET NEAR YOUR VALUATION.
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR ME.
YET, I'M SO STUNNED BY WHAT
YOU'VE DONE... TO PEOPLE??
YOU GOT THEM TO SIGN
THESE CONTRACTS.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $50,000 FOR 51%.
(scoffs)
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WEAR ANKLE BRACELETS,
AND EVERY TIME YOU MENTION??
YOU MENTION THE WORD "DVD"?
24?VOLT SHOCK.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
AND YOU STAY IN THE CARS
AND YOU SIGN THOSE CONTRACTS.
THE PROBLEM IS 5%, EVEN ON
A BUSINESS THAT'S GROWING.
OKAY.
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO COME BACK TO ME,
AND, VERY SIMPLY, IF YOU COME
BACK WITH THE RIGHT NUMBER...
(Barbara) FOR $30,000?
MAN, YOU DO THIS ALL THE TIME.
WELL, I THINK THE GENIUS
OF THIS WHOLE THING
IS THAT YOU'VE FOUND A WAY
TO TAP INTO THE WORKING MOM
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
A LIMIT TO WHAT YOU COULD DO.
BUT I THINK
THE 5% ISN'T ENOUGH
TO GET ME EXCITED
TO BE IN WITH YOU.
OKAY.
SO I NEED
A LARGER PERCENTAGE.
SO RATHER THAN ASK YOU
TO NAME A NUMBER BACK TO ME,
I'M GONNA SAY THAT I'D LIKE
TO GET 20% OF YOUR BUSINESS...
OKAY.
FOR... WHAT? $60,000?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
UM, THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER,
BUT NO, THANK YOU.
YOU SURE?
(Mark) BEFORE YOU COME BACK??
ARE YOU GOING TO COME BACK
AND MAKE A COUNTER?OFFER?
MM?HMM.
OKAY. BEFORE YOU COME BACK
WITH A COUNTEROFFER,
HERE'S THE SCENARIO.
OKAY.
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO
A NEGOTIATION, AND A COMPETITIVE
NEGOTIATION, VERSUS BARBARA,
SO IF I SAY YES TO WHATEVER
YOUR COUNTER IS, YOU HAVE TO
TELL ME THAT YOU WILL SAY YES
IMMEDIATELY,
AND WE HAVE A DEAL.
OKAY.
I LIKE THAT. THAT'S EXCITING.
I KNOW.
MY PALMS ARE SWEATING.
YES? IS THAT A YES?
YES.
OKAY.
OKAY. SO $100,000...
NOW WAIT A MINUTE...
FOR 30%.
DONE. DONE AND DONE.
CRAP.
THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT!
(both scream)
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
(both screaming and laughing)
DID YOU LIKE THAT, BARBARA?
I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT.
(laughs)
THAT WAS SO DAMN SMART. I??
NO, BUT THAT'S
A COMPLIMENT TO YOU,
BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO GET
IN A BACK?AND?FORTH WITH YOU.
WELL, THANK YOU.
IT FEELS SO GOOD.
"BARBARA, I SCREWED YOU,
BUT IT'S A COMPLIMENT TO YOU!"
I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.
I'M JUST A LEAN, MEAN
SHARK MACHINE, BABY!
(both scream)
OH, MY GOSH.
WE'RE SO EXCITED.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
MORE THAN WE EVER IMAGINED.
AND THEY'RE??THE SHARKS,
THEY'RE??THEY'RE TOUGH,
BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT TOUGH.
FELT GOOD ABOUT IT.
THEY GOT OUR VISION.
