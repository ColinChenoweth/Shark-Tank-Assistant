I'M SHAWN DAVIS,
BETTER KNOWN AS CHEF BIG SHAKE,
'CAUSE WHEN I'M IN THE KITCHEN,
I SHAKE IT LIKE THIS.
(sizzling)
I LEARNED HOW TO COOK GROWING UP
WITH MY ITALIAN FAMILY.
YOU HEARD ME??
MY ITALIAN FAMILY.
I GREW UP IN A PRETTY ROUGH AREA
IN NEW YORK. AT THE AGE OF 12,
MY MOTHER MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR
ME TO MOVE IN WITH THE PALMEROS.
GIOVANNI PALMERO OWNED A VERY
SUCCESSFUL ITALIAN RESTAURANT.
HE TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.
THAT'S WHERE I DEVELOPED
MY STRONG PASSION OF COOKING
MY NAME IS SHAWN DAVIS,
BETTER KNOWN AS CHEF BIG SHAKE.
I'M THE PRESIDENT
OF C. B. S. FOODS.
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK
FOR $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25%
OF MY BUSINESS.
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT IS
THE ORIGINAL SHRIMP BURGER.
WE MANUFACTURE THESE BURGERS
TODAY IN FOUR DIFFERENT FLAVORS.
WE HAVE
ORIGINAL, TERIYAKI, CAJUN,
YOU'RE BUYING A BRAND.
YOU'RE BUYING C. B. S. FOODS.
WE'RE BUYING SHAWN.
(Barbara)
AND, SHAWN, I HAVE TO SAY,
I JUST DON'T LIKE SHRIMP AT ALL,
SO I'M JUST GOING OUT
ON THAT BASIS.
SHAWN, MY CONCERN
IS YOUR MARGINS...
YES, SIR.
AREN'T HIGH ENOUGH.
THEY HAVE TO BE NORTH OF 70%
IN SEAFOOD, BECAUSE IT REQUIRES
(Robert)
SHAWN, I LOVE THE PRODUCT.
$200,000 FOR YOUR COMPANY??
I DON'T THINK
YOUR WHOLE COMPANY IS WORTH
$200,000 TO $300,000 TODAY.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUILD IT
