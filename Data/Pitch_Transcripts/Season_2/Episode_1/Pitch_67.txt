I'M SHAWN DAVIS,
BETTER KNOWN AS CHEF BIG SHAKE,
'CAUSE WHEN I'M IN THE KITCHEN,
I SHAKE IT LIKE THIS.
(sizzling)
I LEARNED HOW TO COOK GROWING UP
WITH MY ITALIAN FAMILY.
YOU HEARD ME??
MY ITALIAN FAMILY.
I GREW UP IN A PRETTY ROUGH AREA
IN NEW YORK. AT THE AGE OF 12,
MY MOTHER MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR
ME TO MOVE IN WITH THE PALMEROS.
GIOVANNI PALMERO OWNED A VERY
SUCCESSFUL ITALIAN RESTAURANT.
HE TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.
THAT'S WHERE I DEVELOPED
MY STRONG PASSION OF COOKING
AND DEVELOPING FOOD PRODUCTS.
NOT TOO THIN. THERE YOU GO.
LET THE KNIFE DO THE WORK.
NOW I HAVE
A FAMILY OF MY OWN.
IT WAS FOR MY DAUGHTER
THAT I WAS INSPIRED TO MAKE
THIS HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE
TO THE BURGER,
AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE
LIKE IT.
C.B.S. FOODS.
MY DREAM IS TO BRING
A LITTLE BIT OF CHEF BIG SHAKE
TO EVERY SINGLE DINNER TABLE
ACROSS AMERICA.
MY NAME IS SHAWN DAVIS,
BETTER KNOWN AS CHEF BIG SHAKE.
I'M THE PRESIDENT
OF C. B. S. FOODS.
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK
FOR $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25%
OF MY BUSINESS.
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT IS
THE ORIGINAL SHRIMP BURGER.
WE MANUFACTURE THESE BURGERS
TODAY IN FOUR DIFFERENT FLAVORS.
WE HAVE
ORIGINAL, TERIYAKI, CAJUN,
AND JALAPEÑO,
IF YOU LIKE IT HOT.
TODAY I BROUGHT SOME SAMPLES
FOR YOU GUYS TO TRY.
HEY, SHAKE,
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
MMM.
TASTES GOOD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
TO DATE, WE'VE SOLD OVER
22,000 UNITS OF THESE BURGERS
TO MOM?AND?POP STORES
AND THE RESTAURANTS.
THE SALES HAVE GROSSED
RIGHT AROUND 30 GRAND.
THIS YEAR, I RECOGNIZED
THE BIGGER PICTURE.
MY BURGER NEEDS TO BE
IN EVERY SINGLE SUPERMARKET
ACROSS AMERICA.
THESE ARE THE FACTS??
THE HAMBURGER BUSINESS IS
A MULTIBILLION?DOLLAR?A?YEAR
BUSINESS. TURKEY BURGER??
A BILLION?DOLLAR?A?YEAR
BUSINESS.
BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS??
A BILLION?DOLLAR?A?YEAR
BUSINESS.
(chuckles)
(chuckles) C. B. S. FOODS HAS
PERFECTLY POSITIONED OURSELVES
TO GROW THE SHRIMP BURGER
TO A BILLION?DOLLAR?A?YEAR
BUSINESS,
JUST LIKE ITS COUNTERPARTS.
WHO'S READY TO HELP ME
HELP YOU ADD SOME ZEROS
TO YOUR BOTTOM LINE?
(O'Leary) SO WALK ME THROUGH
WHAT A CASE COSTS TO MAKE
AND WHAT YOU SELL IT FOR.
UM, PER BURGER,
87 CENTS A BURGER.
THAT'S NOT CHEAP.
AND WE RETAIL IT FOR $1.63.
IT'S PROTEIN. IT'S SHRIMP.
LITTLE LIGHT
ON THE MARGINS THERE.
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
THIS IS NOT
A ONE?DIMENSIONAL PRODUCT.
YOU'RE BUYING A BRAND.
YOU'RE BUYING C. B. S. FOODS.
WE'RE BUYING SHAWN.
YOU'RE BUYING
CHEF BIG SHAKE.
AND WHAT OTHER PRODUCTS
ARE UNDER C. B. S.?
THE LOBSTER SLIDER, WHICH
THEY'VE TAKEN 300 CASES OF.
COLLECTIVELY, ALL OF MY MARGINS,
ALL PUT TOGETHER,
ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS,
IS RUNNING RIGHT AROUND 63%.
HOW IS THIS BUSINESS WORTH
$800,000 TODAY?
YOU'VE ONLY GOT $30,000
IN SALES.
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY.
WHAT I HAVE IS COMMITMENTS
FROM TWO SUPERMARKETS
THAT SAID TO ME??
THEY FLEW ME IN AFTER TASTING
EXACTLY WHAT YOU TASTED
AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WANT YOU IN HERE."
SO THESE ARE ONLY
2 SUPERMARKETS OUT OF 32,000
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ORDER.
I WILL HAVE THIS ORDER
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN DAYS.
AND THAT ORDER WILL BE HOW BIG?
FOR THE BURGERS, 600 CASES,
AND FOR THE SLIDERS, 300 CASES.
WHAT WOULD THE DOLLAR AMOUNT
OF THOSE ORDERS BE?
$87,200.
SO YOU'VE GOT $30,000
IN SALES THIS YEAR.
YES.
LET'S SAY IT'S $100,000
IN ORDERS THIS YEAR.
OKAY. OKAY.
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU MAKE
ON $100,000?
I WOULD MAKE ROUGHLY 53%.
(sighs)
(Mark) MAN, I'VE GOTTA SAY,
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.
YOU'VE GOT A CUSTOMER IN ME.
I'LL??I'LL BUY THE PRODUCT.
BUT I REALLY CAN'T ADD VALUE.
I DON'T KNOW THE FOOD BUSINESS.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
THAT I'M OUT.
(Barbara)
AND, SHAWN, I HAVE TO SAY,
I JUST DON'T LIKE SHRIMP AT ALL,
SO I'M JUST GOING OUT
ON THAT BASIS.
(O'Leary) YOU AND I ARE
ACTUALLY DOING BUSINESS
TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.
I OWN THE DEBT OF ONE
OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS
OF CRUSTACEAN AND PROTEINS
OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE
A BOTTOM?FEEDER, KEVIN.
SHAWN, MY CONCERN
IS YOUR MARGINS...
YES, SIR.
AREN'T HIGH ENOUGH.
THEY HAVE TO BE NORTH OF 70%
IN SEAFOOD, BECAUSE IT REQUIRES
A HEAVY COMMITMENT
TO REFRIGERATION AND STORAGE
AND ALSO ACCESS TO SUPPLY
OF THE PROTEIN YOU'RE USING,
WHICH IS
THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD WE EAT
AND THE MOST VULNERABLE TO
PRICE INCREASES AND DECREASES.
SO AT THE END OF THE DAY,
UM, TO ME, WHILE IT'S
AN INTERESTING FOOD CONCEPT,
IT'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE MORE RISKY,
AND, UH,
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
OKAY. OKAY.
(Robert)
SHAWN, I LOVE THE PRODUCT.
$200,000 FOR YOUR COMPANY??
I DON'T THINK
YOUR WHOLE COMPANY IS WORTH
$200,000 TO $300,000 TODAY.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUILD IT
AND IT'S GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL.
THIS IS NOT
A ONE?DIMENSIONAL PRODUCT.
THESE ARE SHRIMP BURGERS.
AMERICA LOVES SHRIMP.
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE
SEAFOOD PRODUCT.
I LOVE THE SHRIMP.
I HATE THE VALUATION.
THE COMPANY
ISN'T WORTH THAT TODAY.
FOR THAT REASON, UH, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
DAYMOND?
I LIKED THOSE BURGERS. I??
LOOK, I ATE 'EM. BOTH OF 'EM.
AND I'M GONNA EAT THE OTHER
GUYS' BURGERS WHEN THEY LEAVE.
(sighs) I CAN'T GET AROUND
THE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE ASKING.
YOU'RE VALUATING
YOUR COMPANY AT $800,000.
I CAN'T GET AROUND IT,
SO I HAVE TO SAY...
WELL, I'M WILLING TO??
I'M WILLING TO...
INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE
TO BUY INTO MY COMPANY.
I'M WILLING TO DO THAT.
WHAT PERCENTAGE?
I'M WILLING TO GO UP TO 30%.
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO LOVES THIS BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO STUDIED THIS BUSINESS.
I HAVE THE STRONG PASSION
AND KNOW HOW TO DO IT.
WHAT IF I OFFER 40%
OF THE COMPANY?
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS RIGHT
EXCEPT FOR THAT NUMBER,
AND YOU'RE NOW AT 40%
FOR $200,000,
SO NOW YOU'RE VALUATING
THE COMPANY AT ABOUT...
ROUGHLY $570,000.
$500,000.
YES, SIR. $500,000.
I'D BE BUYING MORE INTO YOU
'CAUSE YOU'RE A GREAT GUY
THAN BUYING
INTO THE BUSINESS...
SO... I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
(O'Leary)
EVEN IF HE HAS THOSE ORDERS,
THE BUSINESS IS NOT WORTH
$500,000.
NO, BUT HE DID HAVE
A BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW, HE'S??
HE'LL GET THERE.
I HOPE HE REALLY MAKES IT.
WELL, WHEN I GET HOME
AND TELL MY FAMILY THAT
I DIDN'T GET THE INVESTMENT,
I THINK INITIALLY THEY'RE GONNA
BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.
THIS IS NOT GONNA STOP.
I HAVE A STRONG SUPPORT SYSTEM,
AND I KNOW THEY'LL BE THERE,
AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP CONTINUING
MOVING FORWARD.
