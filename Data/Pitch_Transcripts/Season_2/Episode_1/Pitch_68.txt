IF I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU GUYS
A LITTLE CLEARER??
NO, JAMES,
YOU GOTTA STOP SELLING.
I COULD NOT SPEAK TO YOU.
YOU TOOK FOREVER.
(laughs)
BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
(man)
MY NAME IS JAMES MARTIN.
I LIVE IN
BEAUTIFUL OREGON WINE COUNTRY,
AND MY PRODUCT IS COPA DI VINO.
I COME FROM A FAMILY
OF CHERRY FARMERS,
AND MY FAMILY HAS LIVED HERE
FOR SEVEN GENERATIONS.
I WORKED
IN THE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY
AND THEN MOVED BACK
TO THE SMALL COMMUNITY
TO TRY TO RAISE A FAMILY
ON THE FARM
AND BECAME PASSIONATE
ABOUT WINE,
WHICH IS
AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT,
AND DEVELOPED MY OWN WINERY.
COPA! HEY!
COPA DI VINO WILL MAKE WINE
EASIER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE
FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY.
OUR TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS WINEMAKERS
TO BE ABLE TO PACKAGE WINE
IN A WAY THAT THEY'VE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO BEFORE.
I KNOW THAT COPA DI VINO
IS GONNA BE SO SUCCESSFUL
THAT I HOPE TO BE
THE FIRST ENTREPRENEUR
TO ACTUALLY COME BACK
AND BE A SHARK.
MY NAME'S JAMES MARTIN.
I'M C. E. O. AND FOUNDER
OF COPA DI VINO.
I'M HERE TODAY
LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT
OF $600,000
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
I LOVE WINE,
AND IT'S MY FAVORITE WAY
TO CELEBRATE LIFE
WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS,
AND SOME OF THE GREATEST PLACES
TO CELEBRATE LIFE
ARE IN THE OUTDOORS
OR AT EVENTS.
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S WHEN WINE GETS
VERY COMPLICATED.
JUST TO HAVE
A SIMPLE SINGLE GLASS OF WINE,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE WINE BOTTLES,
CORKSCREWS,
AND FRAGILE WINEGLASSES.
THAT'S WHY I CREATED
COPA DI VINO??
AMERICA'S FIRST
PREMIUM WINE BY THE GLASS.
JUST OPEN...
AND ENJOY.
CHEERS.
CUSTOMERS OF WINE
LOVE MY PRODUCT,
BUT FOR BUSINESSES,
THIS IS THE GAME?CHANGER.
FOR A STADIUM
THAT WANTS TO OFFER
A PREMIUM
WINE?BY?THE?GLASS PRODUCT,
THIS PRODUCT IS THE ONLY VESSEL
THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO HAVE
PREMIUM WINE BY THE GLASS.
I HAVE THE LARGEST RETAILERS
AND VENUES IN THE COUNTRY
BEGGING TO SERVE MY PRODUCT.
I JUST NEED YOUR HELP
TO CREATE MORE INVENTORY.
THIS IS THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY
WINE PACKAGING
CREATED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.
ARE YOU SELLING US
ON A PACKAGING SYSTEM,
OR ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU WANT TO ENTER
THE VERY COMPETITIVE
WINE BUSINESS?
I HAVE A WINERY.
IN MY WINERY...
THANK YOU.
CURRENTLY WE MAKE ABOUT
2,500 CASES OF WINE A YEAR,
AND WE'RE NOW CURRENTLY
IN MARKET WITH MY PRODUCT.
IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS, WE'VE
SOLD PRODUCT INTO 26 STATES
WITH THE LARGEST DISTRIBUTORS
IN THE COUNTRY.
CHEERS, BARBARA.
WAIT UP FOR ME.
(O'Leary) SO YOU GROW
YOUR OWN CHARDONNAY GRAPES
AND CABERNET SAUVIGNON?
I BUY FRUIT FROM MY FRIENDS
THAT HAVE VINEYARDS.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
A TOAST TO ALL OF YOU.
WHOOPS.
SO WAS THAT
THE EASIEST GLASS OF WINE
YOU'VE EVER SERVED YOURSELF?
IT'S A LITTLE HARD
TO TAKE OFF.
NO KIDDING?
JAMES, AM I BUYING
A WINE LABEL HERE,
OR AM I BUYING
A PACKAGING SYSTEM?
WE'RE??ACTUALLY HAVE
THREE DIFFERENT REVENUE STREAMS.
WE HAVE
THE ABILITY TO LICENSE
AND??AND COLLECT ROYALTIES,
WE HAVE THE ABILITY
TO BOTTLE FOR AN INDUSTRY,
AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY
TO GO AHEAD AND LAUNCH
OUR OWN CONSUMER BRAND.
AND WHICH OF THE STREAMS ARE
BRINGING IN SALES TODAY?
AT FIRST, RIGHT NOW, OUR OWN
CONSUMER BRAND, COPA DI VINO.
AND WHAT ARE SALES
IN THAT TODAY?
WELL, WE'VE BEEN IN
THE MARKET FOR FIVE MONTHS,
AND WE'VE HAD
A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF SALES.
WE'VE HAD OVER $800,000
WORTH OF ORDERS.
WOW.
THAT'S QUICK.
SO PEOPLE ARE BUYING YOUR WINE
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO CARRY?
ABSOLUTELY,
AND THEY'RE ALSO GETTING??
WHEN THEY'RE DRINKING
MY PRODUCT,
THEY'RE ALSO GETTING A?A??
DON'T COME AND TELL ME
THIS IS PREMIUM WINE. IT'S NOT.
IT'S JUST INDUSTRIAL WINE.
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE A WINE SNOB.
LET'S BE REAL.
SO WHAT? TO ME, I WOULDN'T BUY
THIS WINE. THAT'S JUST ME.
YOU'RE GOING AFTER
MASS?MARKET.
I THINK THE PACKAGING
IS THE PLAY.
RIGHT.
HOW LONG DOES IT STAY FRESH?
WE'RE GOOD FOR A YEAR.
THE CHALLENGE WITH ANYTIME
THAT YOU REDUCE IT DOWN
TO A SMALL AMOUNT,
IS THAT THE SHELF LIFE
IS VERY, VERY SHORT.
USUALLY, 30 DAYS.
WELL...
YOU'RE GETTING A YEAR
OUT OF IT.
HAVE YOU PATENTED
THIS PACKAGING?
ABSOLUTELY.
NOT ONLY DID WE CREATE A WAY TO
ATMOSPHERICALLY PACKAGE LIQUID,
WE'VE CREATED A WAY THAT
WHEN ALCOHOL VOLATILIZES
UNDER HEAT OR PRESSURE,
IT WON'T BLOW THE SEAL.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE TOP LABORATORIES
IN THE??IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE
WORKED ON THIS PROJECT.
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT?
ALL THE KROGER CHAINS,
RALPHS, 7?ELEVEN.
UM, WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS
WITH THEM.
WHY ARE WE EVEN
IN THE WINE BUSINESS?
WHY AREN'T WE LICENSING THIS
TO ALL THE WINERIES?
WHY AREN'T WE GOING TO MONDAVI
AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND SAYING,
"BUY THIS"?
WE ARE. BUT RIGHT NOW
WE'RE WORKING ON PROJECTS
WITH TWO OF THE NINE LARGEST
WINE COMPANIES IN??IN THE WORLD.
YEAH, HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU
GONNA MAKE OFF THOSE DEALS?
ESTIMATES NEXT YEAR IS ABOUT
$3 MILLION TO $5 MILLION.
OF SALES?
OF SALES.
NOW I HAVE
A DIFFERENT QUESTION.
WHY DO WE EVEN NEED TO BE IN
THE PACKAGING BUSINESS AT ALL?
MM?HMM.
WHY IS THIS NOT A PATENT ASSET
THAT WE GO AND MARKET TO
THE LARGEST PACKAGING COMPANIES
ON EARTH?
YOU KNOW, THE WINE INDUSTRY
RIGHT NOW NEEDS COMPANIES
LIKE MINE TO SERVICE THEM
FOR THESE NICHE NEEDS.
THEY DON'T WANT TO INVEST INTO
EQUIPMENT AND HAVE TO LEARN??
ESPECIALLY THIS PROCESS.
THIS IS AN ART. THIS IS NOT??
THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
THEY WANT TO KNOW IT WORKS,
'CAUSE THEY'VE SEEN IT
FAIL SO MANY TIMES.
OH, ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
SO THIS IS HIS WAY
OF SHOWING THAT IT WORKS.
LISTEN, THERE'S A BELIEF??
PIONEERS GET SLAUGHTERED,
AND SETTLERS PROSPER.
WITH THAT SAID, YOU'RE JUST
TOO EARLY FOR ME. I'M OUT.
JAMES, IS THERE A WAY
TO TAKE THE PATENT
OUT OF
COPA DI VINA??DI VINO?
MM?HMM.
I REALLY LIKE YOUR PATENT.
CAN WE PULL THE TWO APART?
CAN WE SEPARATE
THE LICENSING, I. P.??
FOR CLARITY, I. P.??
THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
I.P. AS A SEPARATE ENTITY
AND LEAVE YOU
WITH THE WINE BUSINESS?
WE CAN.
SO IF YOU CAN COME BACK
TO ME AND SAY,
"MARK, HERE'S HOW I'D VALUE
THE PATENT,
"THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,
HERE'S HOW MUCH CASH I'D LIKE,
AND HERE'S HOW MUCH STOCK
I'M WILLING TO OFFER"...
MM?HMM.
I'M WIDE OPEN TO THAT.
YEP.
AND THEN YOU CAN OWN AND RUN
WITH YOUR WINE COMPANY...
MM?HMM.
AND BUILD AS BIG A BRAND
AS YOU LIKE.
MARK, YOU??YOU HAVE??
YOUR ATTENDANCE IN YOUR STADIUMS
EVERY YEAR IS RISING.
OH, NO. IT'S NOT LOST TO ME
THAT I COULD RESELL THESE.
ABSOLUTELY.
NOT LOST TO ME THAT
I COULD STILL BE A CUSTOMER.
I MEAN,
IF YOU MADE A FEW CALLS,
HOW MANY STADIUMS WOULD
THIS PRODUCT BE SOLD IN?
I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT
AT ALL...
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE IN
THE COMMISSION SALES BUSINESS.
YEAH.
LET'S GET FOCUSED ON THAT, SO
THAT AT LEAST I CAN UNDERSTAND,
IF I GAVE YOU A CHECK
FOR $600,000,
HOW MUCH OF THE I. P. COMPANY
AND BOTTLER I COULD OWN.
HOW MUCH IS THAT?
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING
TO SELL ME FOR $600,000?
20%.
NOT ENOUGH.
YOU'VE ALREADY DEVALUED
THE BRAND TO WORTH THIS MUCH...
(Daymond)
THEY DIDN'T DEVALUE IT.
NO, NO, NO. WE DIDN'T DEVALUE
IT TO ZERO. NOT AT ALL.
(Daymond) THEY JUST SAID
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN IT.
OR A NEGATIVE.
NO, NO. IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T
WANT TO BE IN THAT BUSINESS.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SAID
IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING. WE??
YEAH. YEAH.
BUT I THINK FOR ME, I'M NOT
GONNA TRY TO TALK YOU INTO
SPLITTING ONE FROM THE OTHER,
AND MY GUT FEEL IS,
IT'S NOT THE DIRECTION
YOU WANT TO DO TODAY.
I'M NOT A WINE GUY. I DON'T
WANT TO BUILD THE BRAND,
SO I'M OUT FOR THAT REASON.
JAMES, I DON'T THINK
I CAN BRING ANYTHING
TO THE TABLE IN THIS.
I'M OUT.
THE REAL VALUE IN
ALL OF THIS IS THE I. P...
UH?HUH.
BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY OWN IT,
THIS CATEGORY COULD EXPLODE,
AND YOU WILL MAKE SOMETHING OFF
EVERY TIME SOMEBODY RIPS
THE TOP OFF ONE
OF THESE PLASTIC OR GLASS??
SURE. YEP.
THAT'S A BUSINESS, MY FRIEND.
THAT'S HOW YOU GET RICH.
ABSOLUTELY. YEP.
NOW CAN YOU FOCUS ON THAT
AND TELL ME HOW MUCH OF THAT
YOU'D SELL ME FOR $600,000?
(O'Leary) NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO. JAMES, JAMES, JAMES??
STOP SELLING, JAMES.
YOU GOTTA STOP SELLING.
I'M A DREAM COME TRUE
FOR YOU.
DO I BELIEVE THIS HAS
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY? ABSOLUTELY.
HAVE I PUT
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS
OF MY OWN MONEY INTO THIS?
I HAVE.
AND IS THAT WORTH GOING AHEAD
AND SELLING, AT THIS POINT
WHAT WE'VE??WHAT WE'VE CREATED,
OFF TO SOMEBODY ELSE
TO CONTROL THAT PORTION OF IT?
THAT'S THE SPECIAL SAUCE.
WE ALL KNOW THAT.
WHY GIVE AWAY YOUR SPECIAL SAUCE
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE IT INTEGRATED
INTO THE OTHER ASPECTS
OF YOUR BUSINESS
THAT RIGHT NOW
ARE SUCCESSFUL?
I'M WORKING ON??ON??ON,
RIGHT NOW,
CONTRACTS OF OVER
$15 MILLION TO $20 MILLION
ON PRIVATE LABEL PROJECTS
WITH 7?ELEVEN, WITH TARGET,
WITH SOME OF THE BIGGEST
WINE COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.
WILL HE GET AN ANSWER
AT ANY POINT?
(O'Leary) LOOK, JAMES??
THE ANSWER IS NO.
WELL, THEN COUNTER ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR 51%?
$3 MILLION.
FORGET IT. NOT A CHANCE.
JAMES, LISTEN TO ME,
I AM GOING TO GO BUY
A THOUSAND?DOLLAR BOTTLE
OF WINE TONIGHT,
AND I'M GONNA DRINK IT,
BECAUSE I'M WEEPING FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY YOU LOST.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN
FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT,
AND THEN I'LL NEVER REMEMBER
IT AGAIN, AND I WON'T CARE,
BECAUSE THERE'S
A MILLION OPPORTUNITIES
THAT ARE GONNA COME TO ME
TOMORROW. THIS WAS YOUR MOMENT.
MM?HMM.
YOU TURNED AROUND. IT'S GONE.
YOU LOOKED A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH, JAMES.
OHH.
YOU REALLY DID.
CHEERS.
(Daymond and Robert)
CHEERS.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THE GUY NEEDED ME TO GET FOCUSED
ON WHAT REALLY MATTERED.
YOU COULD'VE??LOOK, YOU COULD'VE
MADE MONEY ON THAT SIDE OF IT,
BUT HE HAD A GRAND SLAM,
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW IT.
I FORGET WHO HE IS.
I DON'T CARE NOW. IT'S OVER.
HE'S A DEAD MAN WALKING,
JUST ANOTHER DEAL.
RIGHT.
KEVIN TOTALLY MISSED THE MARK.
THE VALUE ON OUR PRODUCT
<i>IS</i> THE BRAND.
WE'RE THE FIRST TO DO
WINE BY THE GLASS.
IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
AND A HUGE MARKET,
AND WE'VE ALREADY PROVED THAT,
SO THE IDEA
THAT WE'RE GONNA BREAK IT DOWN
TO ONE LITTLE COMPONENT,
AND THAT IS SELL THE PATENTS,
WOULD BE SELLING THE LIFE
OUT OF THE OPPORTUNITY.
