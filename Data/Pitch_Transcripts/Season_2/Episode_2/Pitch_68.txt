I'M NIKKI POPE.
I LIVE
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS TOYGAROO.
(singsongy)
LOOK WHAT I HAVE.
YAY!
I HAVE 13 NIECES AND NEPHEWS,
AND THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE
PLAYING WITH TOYS.
I CALL THEM
MY PLAYTIME PROFESSIONALS.
THE PROBLEM IS, THEY GET BORED
WITH THOSE TOYS REALLY QUICKLY.
THAT IS WHAT INSPIRED ME AND MY
HUSBAND TO CREATE TOYGAROO.
TOYGAROO OFFERS
A COST?EFFECTIVE WAY
NOT ONLY FOR PARENTS
TO DECLUTTER THEIR HOMES,
BUT TO KEEP THEIR KIDS
CHALLENGED AND ENTERTAINED.
MY HUSBAND AND I DON'T HAVE
ANY KIDS YET,
BUT WE WOULD DEFINITELY
LIKE TO,
AND AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS WOULD MEAN
THAT WE WOULD HAVE
THE STABILITY WE NEED
TO START A FAMILY OF OUR OWN.
MY DREAM FOR MY COMPANY
IS THAT
EVERY FAMILY WHO HAS CHILDREN
WHO LOVE TO PLAY WITH TOYS
WILL USE TOYGAROO,
AND I REALLY HOPE THE SHARKS
WILL HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
MY NAME IS NIKKI.
MY COMPANY IS TOYGAROO.
AND I AM ASKING FOR $100,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF MY COMPANY.
TOYGAROO SOLVES A PROBLEM
THAT MILLIONS OF FAMILIES
FACE EVERY DAY.
I HAVE 11 BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
AND I AM LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE 13 OUTSTANDING
NIECES AND NEPHEWS,
ALL UNDER THE AGE OF 8.
ONE THING THAT I'VE NOTICED
IS THAT MY SIBLINGS
ARE PURCHASING TOY AFTER TOY
FOR THEIR KIDS.
THEIR PLAYROOMS,
THEIR LIVING ROOMS,
THEIR BEDROOMS
ARE CLUTTERED WITH TOYS
THAT WERE PURCHASED,
PLAYED WITH FOR A FEW WEEKS,
AND NOW ARE LEFT
COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED.
TOYGAROO SOLVES THAT PROBLEM
AND MORE.
MY COMPANY IS THE NETFLIX
FOR TOYS.
CONSUMERS CAN GO
TO MY WEB SITE,
PICK A PLAN
THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM,
FILL THEIR WISH LIST WITH TOYS
THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE,
AND I SHIP THOSE TOYS
RIGHT TO THEIR DOOR.
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT MY COMPANY IS,
WHEN THEIR KIDS GET BORED WITH
OR OUTGROW THOSE TOYS,
THEY JUST THROW 'EM IN THE BOX,
USE THE RETURN LABEL THAT WE
PROVIDED, SEND 'EM BACK TO US,
AND WE SEND 'EM
THEIR NEXT BOX OF TOYS.
CAN I JUST SEE YOUR SNAIL?
I JUST WANT TO SEE
WHAT THE QUALITY IS LIKE.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND HOW MANY TOYS
ARE IN YOUR CATALOG?
WE HAVE OVER 300
DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOYS.
(Daymond) WHAT IS
THE SERVICING OF IT?
YOU KNOW,
THE TOYS COME BACK,
OBVIOUSLY KIDS
ARE NOT THE CLEANEST...
RIGHT.
SO YOU GOT DROOL ON THE TOYS,
YOU HAVE BEDBUGS.
WOULD THEY HAVE PEE PEE
AND POOH POOH ON THE TOYS?
MAYBE.
THERE HAS TO BE A PROCESS.
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HIRED
TO DO THIS.
WITH OUR COMPANY, THE CLEANING
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT,
AND SO THE??THE TOY
GETS SANITIZED.
I SANITIZE IT.
AND YOU SHRINK?WRAP IT?
AND WE SHRINK?WRAP IT
EVERY TIME.
WHO ELSE IS DOING THIS, NIKKI?
THERE IS NOT ANOTHER COMPANY
THAT IS DOING THIS.
SO, N?NIKKI,
WHAT ABOUT DAMAGE?
IN SIX MONTHS,
WE HAD ZERO TOYS
THAT WE HAD TO
COMPLETELY REPLACE.
IF A CHILD DOES BREAK THE TOY,
WE SELL IT TO THE MEMBER
AT A DISCOUNTED COST.
NIKKI, WALK US THROUGH
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?
ALL OF OUR MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY PAY
A MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP FEE.
WE HAVE PLANS THAT START
AT $35 A MONTH...
(Daymond) WHOA.
AND THEY GO ALL THE WAY UP
TO $89 A MONTH.
THAT'S A LOT.
$35 A MONTH?
RIGHT.
AND HOW MANY FAMILIES
PAY YOU THAT?
UH, WE DID A SOFT LAUNCH
WITH 500 MEMBERS.
IT WAS BASICALLY
LIKE A TEST LAUNCH.
THEY WERE ALL PAYING
$42 A MONTH
FOR A BOX OF TOYS
THAT'S WORTH OVER $200.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
BASICALLY,
IS IT COSTS THEM
ABOUT $500 A YEAR.
EXACTLY, WHICH IS GREAT,
BECAUSE THE AVERAGE FAMILY
SPENDS ANYWHERE BETWEEN
$1,200 AND $1,400 A YEAR.
AND TELL ME AGAIN, THE COST
PER TOY BOX THAT YOU SHIP
WAS $200, DID YOU SAY?
MM?HMM.
AND WHAT'S YOUR COST ON
THE TOYS THAT YOU'RE SHIPPING?
ON THE BOX OF TOYS,
IT'S GONNA BE ANYWHERE
BETWEEN $50 TO $85, $90.
THAT'S TWO AND A HALF MONTHS,
YOU BREAK EVEN, EACH CUSTOMER.
RIGHT.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
NIKKI, HOW DO YOU
SCALE IT UP?
HOW DO YOU MAKE THIS
A BIG BUSINESS?
ALL WE NEED IS MORE MARKETING,
MORE EXPOSURE.
IN THE SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME
THAT WE HAD OUR 500 CUSTOMERS,
JUST BY WORD OF MOUTH,
WE GOT A WAITING LIST
OF OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE
READY TO SIGN UP.
NIKKI, I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS??IF
THE BUSINESS BEGINS TO GROW...
MM?HMM.
DOES IT SUCK UP
A TON OF CASH?
NIKKI, FOR EVERY
$1 MILLION OF SALES,
HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO PUT IN
TO BUY INVENTORY OF TOYS?
JUST IN TOYS.
JUST IN TOYS? $64,000.
THAT'S GONNA COVER
A YEAR OF TOYS.
OKAY, NIKKI.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU DON'T HAVE
A MILLION?DOLLAR BUSINESS YET.
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO PAY YOU
AS IF YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH $1 MILLION,
AND IT'S NOT.
BUT I WANT TO BE
AN INVESTOR IN IT.
YOU HAVE A GOOD IDEA.
THIS IS INTERESTING.
SO... (clicks tongue) THIS IS
A LEAP OF FAITH FOR ME,
BECAUSE I HAVE TO THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GROW THIS THING.
DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTNERS?
YOU'RE DOING THIS ON YOUR OWN?
UH, MY HUSBAND IS A PARTNER.
AND THEN I HAVE A WEB DESIGNER
AND TWO ONLINE MARKETERS
THAT ARE PARTNERING WITH ME.
HOW MUCH DO YOU OWN?
I OWN 10% OF THE COMPANY.
(Daymond) YOU OWN 10%?
WHO OWNS THE REST?
WHERE'S THE OTHER 90%?
(Nikki) WE ALL OWN 10%.
AND MY HUSBAND OWNS
THE??THE BIGGER CHUNK OF??
WHICH IS HOW MUCH?
HE OWNS 50%.
WHY DOES YOUR HUSBAND
OWN A BIGGER CHUNK?
UM, BECAUSE I??WE??
THAT'S HOW WE DECIDED.
HOW HAPPILY MARRIED
ARE YOU?
(sharks laugh)
I'M INCREDIBLY
HAPPILY MARRIED.
WHY WOULD YOU,
WHO CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA,
GIVE SO MUCH TO YOUR PARTNER?
WHY?
UM, HE'S WORKED WITH ME,
AND BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS
WITH ME EVERY DAY.
DO YOU HAVE
A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT?
(laughs) NO, WE DON'T.
OH.
WE WERE HALF AND HALF
WHEN WE STARTED, OKAY?
AND YOU SOLD YOUR PIECE
TO ALL THESE OTHERS,
AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE ANY
FROM HIM?
THE WAY THAT WE WORKED
THE COMPANY IS,
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
OUR FAMILY AS A WHOLE
HAD THE??THE MAJORITY SHARE,
OKAY?
BUT TO KEVIN'S POINT THEN,
WHY DIDN'T YOU EACH GIVE AWAY
SOME OF YOUR SHARES?
(Robert) YEAH.
UM, I DON'T KNOW.
UM, I'VE HAD A BAD HISTORY
OF SPEAKING TO PEOPLE
WHO DON'T HAVE CONTROLLING
OF THE COMPANY.
I'M OUT.
(Kevin) NIKKI, YOU KNOW,
I?I WISH YOU OWNED MORE,
BUT NEVERTHELESS,
I'D LIKE TO MAKE YOU
AN OFFER HERE.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 35%.
RARELY, NIKKI,
DO I NOT ASK FOR CONTROL,
'CAUSE I'M A CONTROL FREAK.
OKAY.
BUT I TRUST YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU DO.
AND I CAN HELP YOU IMMENSELY
IN THE TOY SPACE. IMMENSELY.
DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SELL 35%, NIKKI?
UM, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO
WHATEVER I WANT
WITH THE COMPANY, YES.
I HAD MY EYE ON YOU
WHEN I CAME IN HERE.
I HAVE MY EYE ON YOU.
NIKKI, YOU ARE
THE FIRST PERSON EVER TO WALK
INTO THE SHARK TANK AND ACTUALLY
BE ATTRACTED TO HIM.
(laughs)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S GOT A TOUGH EXTERIOR,
BUT I'M A SOUTHERN GIRL,
AND I KNEW I COULD GET HIM.
AND SHE'S RIGHT.
HE'S BLUSHING.
HE IS BLUSHING.
(Barbara) HE REALLY IS.
(Mark laughs)
NIKKI, I'VE MADE YOU AN OFFER.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
NIKKI, JUST??JUST BEFORE
YOU??YOU ANSWER THAT...
MARK, I SEE THIS
AS AN INTERNET,
UH, LOGISTICS PLAY.
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED?
I'D LIKE TO GET IN
ON THIS ONE WITH YOU.
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN PUTTING UP MORE MONEY?
ABSOLUTELY.
BECAUSE I THINK REALLY
THE KEY ISSUE FOR ME??
IT'S A WEB SITE,
SOCIAL MEDIA.
I'M IN THAT WORLD, BUT I THINK
YOU GOTTA GO FASTER
THAN YOU'RE SUGGESTING.
I AGREE 100%.
SO KEVIN'S OFFERING $100,000
FOR 35%.
I'M THINKING
WE RAISE MORE MONEY.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?
I WAS THINKING $200,000
OR $250,000
FOR MAYBE 35% OR 40%.
I?I'D SPLIT $200,000
FOR 40%.
OKAY.
WELL, YOU JUST KNOCKED ME OUT.
I WAS GONNA OFFER A LOT LESS.
I'M OUT.
(mouths word)
(Kevin) I WANT YOU TO KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT ME.
I AM MR. TOY.
I SOLD MY COMPANY TO MATTEL.
I KNOW IT.
I LIVED IN FISHER?PRICE
FOR A YEAR.
THOSE TOYS ARE MY FRIENDS.
I SPEAK TOY.
I JUST THINK YOU NEED
MORE CAPITAL.
OKAY.
YOU GOTTA GET GOING FASTER.
OKAY.
THAT'S GONNA BE
YOUR ONLY ADVANTAGE.
AND YOU NEED SOMEONE WITH
INTERNET HYPERGROWTH EXPERIENCE.
OKAY.
IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO START PARTNERING
WITH SOME OF THE TOY COMPANIES.
LET ME TELL YOU.
AND THERE'S 2 THAT OWN 90%,
AND I KNOW
ALL THEIR BOARD MEMBERS.
MARK AND I ARE OFFERING YOU
$200,000...
OKAY.
FOR 40%.
OKAY.
MR. O'LEARY'S OFFERING YOU
$100,000 FOR 35%.
(Kevin)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
NIKKI...
I DON'T THINK THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE TOY COMPANIES REALLY??
OH, YEAH? YOU DON'T THINK
THAT MATTERS?
NO, NO, NO. HANG ON A SEC.
I NEVER SAID IT DIDN'T MATTER.
IT'S NOT CRITICAL TO GET GOING.
AND SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN THROUGH
AN ONLINE SERVICE...
(Nikki) OKAY.
THAT'S BUILT
AROUND SUBSCRIPTIONS,
SOMEONE WHO DOES BUSINESS
WITH NETFLIX
AND KNOWS HOW THEY WORK,
AND OTHER ONLINE SERVICES...
OKAY.
THAT IS WHAT'S GONNA GET YOU
OVER THE TOP.
WE CAN GET THE DOOR OPENING
TO FISHER?PRICE
OR ANY TOY COMPANY.
ONCE WE HAVE THE CUSTOMERS,
I MEAN, MY COMPANY
SECURES AND SERVICES
SOME OF THE LARGEST
INTERNET SITES IN THE WORLD.
ONCE WE HAVE THE CUSTOMERS,
TRUST ME, THERE'S NO PROBLEM
GOING TO MATTEL
OR THESE TOY COMPANIES??
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY GUYS
THAT PROVIDE...
THEY NEED PEOPLE TO SELL??
INTERNET LOGISTIC SERVICES.
THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY
FULL OF GUYS LIKE THIS.
DIME A DOZEN.
I THINK I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW TO BUILD THIS BUSINESS
AND EXACTLY HOW TO EXIT IT,
WHICH MATTERS TO YOU.
THAT'S HOW YOU ACTUALLY
MAKE MONEY.
I WOULD LIKE $200,000.
UM, I?I WAS GONNA ASK YOU GUYS
IF YOU'D CONSIDER
35% FOR $200,000.
ARE YOU SAYING,
IF I MATCH THEIR OFFER,
YOU'LL DO THE DEAL WITH ME?
DONE.
HOW ABOUT THIS?
I LIKE WHAT THIS GUY BRINGS,
SO I'LL SPLIT IT WITH HIM.
I'LL DO THAT.
WE HAVE A DEAL.
DONE.
(Barbara) WOW.
YOU'RE OUT IN THE COLD.
AH?HA?HA! ROBERT,
HE CUT YOU OUT.
ROBERT, I'M SO SORRY.
I'M VERY EXCITED.
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA.
ME, TOO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I LOVE IT.
ROBERT, YOU WERE THE TOY
THEY WERE PLAYING WITH
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
AND SHE SENT YOU BACK.
