HI, MY NAME'S JOE MOORE.
I AM THE PRESIDENT AND C. E. O.
OF THE FIRST DEFENSE
NASAL SCREEN CORPORATION.
AND I'M SEEKING $500,000
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
(blows air)
EVERY DAY,
PEOPLE FLOOD EMERGENCY ROOMS,
DOCTOR'S OFFICES,
AND PHARMACIES SEEKING RELIEF
FROM INHALING CONTAMINATED AIR.
AND ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE
COMMERCIALS ON TV TODAY
IS ABOUT THE TREATMENT
OF NASAL ALLERGIES.
THAT'S WHY I INVENTED
FIRST DEFENSE NASAL SCREENS.
FIRST DEFENSE NASAL SCREENS
ARE THE FIRST AND ONLY
LIGHTWEIGHT, NON?INSERTED,
ALMOST NON?VISIBLE NASAL SCREEN
EVER INVENTED,
AND THEY HAVE BEEN
CLINICALLY PROVEN
TO REDUCE THE INHALATION
OF ALLERGENS, POLLENS,
POLLUTIONS, PET DANDERS, MOLDS,
VIRUSES, AND MORE BY UP TO 99%.
AND THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE FACED WITH UNHEALTHY,
CONTAMINATED AIR,
REMEMBER, DON'T GET SICK.
JUST PEEL AND STICK.
THANK YOU.
ANY QUESTIONS?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
UM...
UM, I'M??I'M??I'M NOT.
UM, I JUST KNOW THAT, LIKE
I SAID, HOW BIG THIS REALLY IS.
$500,000
FOR 10% OF THE COMPANY.
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW
ABOUT 1.7 MILLION.
1.7 MILLION UNITS
OR $1.7 MILLION IN TOTAL SALES?
1.7, UH, MILLION UNITS.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
WHOLESALE WAS 60 CENTS.
SO YOUR SALES LAST YEAR
WERE HOW MUCH, JOE?
ACTUALLY, WE JUST??WE'RE NOT??
WE HAVEN'T GONE TO MARKET YET.
SORRY, I'M CONFUSED. YOU'RE??
WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.
IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE TO MARKET,
HOW HAVE YOU SOLD 1.7 MILLION?
UM, ACTUALLY,
WE HAVE ONE BIG CLIENT OUT OF
THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
THAT HAS ACTUALLY PUT IN THEIR
FIRST ORDER AND GIVEN US
A CONTRACT FOR $8 MILLION
OVER THE NEXT 6 YEARS.
SO YOU HAVE AN ORDER
FOR $8 MILLION?
YES, SIR.
RIGHT NOW?
YES, SIR.
MATTER OF FACT...
I HAVE THE CONTRACT
RIGHT HERE.
THAT'S A PREPARED MAN
RIGHT THERE. GOOD FOR YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.
WELL, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU DON'T LOOK THAT FUNNY
WITH THAT STUFF STUCK UP
YOUR NOSE. CAN I SEE THAT?
YES, YOU CAN.
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE
THE BOZO I THOUGHT YOU WERE.
(Daymond) YEAH.
IS THIS A PRODUCT THAT PERHAPS
IS??IS GOING TO BE VERY POPULAR
IN OTHER SOCIETIES, WHERE
FACE MASKS ARE MORE PROMINENT
THAN THEY'RE HERE STATESIDE?
DEFINITELY. THIS IS
A WORLDWIDE PRODUCT.
'CAUSE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE WEARING THEM RIGHT NOW.
I CAN SEE THEM. IT'S PROBABLY
AN ISSUE FOR MANY PEOPLE
THAT ARE GONNA LOOK AT THAT
AND SAY, "WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
STUCK UP YOUR NOSE?"
(Barbara) MAY I SEE
THE ACTUAL PRODUCT?
YES, MA'AM.
I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU.
ROBERT.
"THE DISTRIBUTOR GUARANTEES
THAT HE'LL ORDER 1??"
AM I READING THIS CORRECTLY??
"1 MILLION, 500,000 SETS"?
YES, SIR. THAT'S FOR
SAUDI ARABIA ALONE.
THEY'VE ALREADY ORDERED THOSE.
AND HOW MUCH
IS HE GUARANTEEING YOU?
UH, HE'S GUARANTEEING ME
THE 8 MILLION
OVER THE NEXT,
UM, SIX YEARS.
HOW DOES THE FILTER WORK?
BASICALLY,
HOW THE FILTER WORKS...
IS, AS YOU BREATHE IN,
IT'S A NON?WOVEN MATERIAL,
SO IT CLOSES,
AND AS YOU BREATHE OUT,
IT FLUSHES ITSELF.
DOES IT STOP VIRUSES,
BACTERIAL IN??
IT DOES.
WHAT'S TO STOP YOU FROM TAKING
THE GERMS IN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH?
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
90% OF THE AIR WE BREATHE
GOES THROUGH OUR NASAL PASSAGES.
ALSO, VIRUSES DO NOT GROW
IN THE MOUTH, THE ESOPHAGUS,
OR LINING OF THE STOMACH.
THEY GROW IN THE NASAL PASSAGE.
IS THERE A PATENT
THAT PROTECTS THIS?
YES, SIR. I HAVE??
WHAT'S PATENTED?
UH, WE HAVE A PATENT PENDING
IN THE UNITED STATES,
CANADA AND EUROPE,
AND HAVE BEEN FOR THREE YEARS.
AND WHAT WOULD YOU USE
THE MONEY FOR?
THE MONEY FOR RIGHT NOW IS
SO THAT I CAN KEEP PRODUCING IT
BECAUSE OF THE RAW MATERIALS
I HAVE TO BUY UPFRONT.
SO BASICALLY,
YOU NEED THE $500,000
TO MAKE THE ORDER.
CORRECT.
OKAY, TELL ME IF I'M
PUTTING THESE IN RIGHT.
SO I JUST TAKE IT??
THE BEST WAY TO DO IT??PUT IT
ON YOUR FINGER LIKE A CONTACT,
TOUCH YOUR NASAL PASSAGE,
SLIDE IT AROUND ON THE OUTSIDE,
SLIDE IT ON THE INSIDE.
(Robert) JOE,
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
WHY NOT JUST GO LICENSE IT TO
ONE OF THE BIG DRUG COMPANIES?
UM, BECAUSE I?I DID THAT
ORIGINALLY.
I WENT TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST
IN THE UNITED STATES,
AND THEY TOLD ME
WE WERE ACTUALLY A COMPETITOR,
AND IF THEY TOOK THE PRODUCT,
THEY WOULD SHELVE IT.
BECAUSE WHY WOULD THEY
PREVENT IT FOR $1
WHEN THEY COULD TREAT IT
FOR $14?
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU PUT INTO THIS?
WE HAVE ALMOST A MIL??
$1 MILLION INTO THIS PRODUCT.
AND WHERE'D THAT MONEY
COME FROM?
UM, ABOUT $600,000 OF IT
WAS MINE,
AND THE REST IS FROM FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.
I THINK I'D HAVE A VERY HARD
TIME UNDERSTANDING AT ALL
WHAT THE PRODUCT IS ABOUT
UNLESS YOU HAD THESE BIG PHOTOS
WITH THE NOSES
AND UNLESS YOU'RE STANDING THERE
PITCHING IT,
BECAUSE I THINK THE COST
OF EDUCATING PEOPLE
IS THE BIG KAHUNA HERE.
JOE, BASED ON THAT,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I'M INTRIGUED,
I GOTTA TELL YA.
LET ME THROW
AN OFFER OUT TO YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $500,000,
AND I WANT A 15% ROYALTY
ON EVERY UNIT SOLD
UNTIL I RECOUP MY $500,000.
OKAY, JUST THE ROYALTY,
NO EQUITY?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
OF COURSE I WANT THE EQUITY.
I TOOK THE RISK.
NOW HERE'S MY EQUITY??
I WANT 20%.
YOU HAVE AN OFFER FROM ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO HEAR
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO SAY
BEFORE I WOULD EVEN CONSIDER??
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED.
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED.
THEY NEVER TOLD ME
THEY WERE OUT.
BECAUSE OF THEIR SILENCE,
YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED.
NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER
ON THIS.
HMM.
OKAY, YOU GOT A DEAL.
YEAH.
I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE HOW CUDDLY THEY ARE,
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU
$800,000 FOR 30%...
WITH 10% ROYALTY.
OH, COME ON.
SCREW THAT.
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION
FOR THE WHOLE COMPANY RIGHT NOW.
I... CAN APPRECIATE, UH,
AND I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
I REALLY DO,
BUT, UM, I WOULD DEFINITELY??
YOU JUST TURNED DOWN
$1 MILLION.
YES, SIR. I?I?I COULDN'T TAKE
$1 MILLION.
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
A BILLION?DOLLAR INDUSTRY.
IS THERE A NUMBER
YOU WOULD TAKE...
TO SELL THE WHOLE COMPANY?
ONE CHECK.
NOT, UH,
WITHOUT A ROYALTY? NO.
WITH A ROYALTY?
VERY POSSIBLY, YES.
WHAT'S THE ROYALTY?
I BELIEVE THAT
WITH THE STATISTICS
AND THE RESEARCH WE'VE DONE,
THE ROYALTY
WOULD HAVE TO BE 10%.
WHOA.
AND THEN WHAT'S THE NUMBER
ON THE COMPANY?
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY A PART
OF IT, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
BECAUSE IT'S MY PASSION. I, UM,
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
NO, I DON'T WANNA SEE.
I AM A CANCER??I AM A CANC??
I AM A CANCER SURVIVOR.
OH.
I'M A CANCER SURVIVOR.
BY THE TIME I WAS 19 YEARS OLD,
I'D BEEN THROUGH THE ARMY, I'D
BEEN THROUGH THE MARINE CORPS,
I'D BEEN HALFWAY AROUND
THE WORLD.
I FOUGHT ALL MY LIFE
IN DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.
I BELIEVE IN THIS
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN TESTIMONIALS
FROM PEOPLE SAYING,
"YOU'VE CHANGED MY LIFE, YOU'VE
CHANGED THE QUALITY OF MY LIFE."
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION.
I WANT 30% OF THE COMPANY
ALSO 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I RECOUP THE MONEY.
JOE, I'LL GIVE YOU $2 MILLION
FOR THE WHOLE BUSINESS...
AND THE 10% ROYALTY
YOU ASKED FOR BACK TO YOU.
I JUST LOVE THIS WHOLE THING.
WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE YOU
A MILLIONAIRE, JUST LIKE THAT.
BUT I HAVE THREE OFFERS
AND I'M KIND OF CONFUSED.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE 'EM A LITTLE
BIT MORE CLEAR IF I CAN.
THE FIRST OFFER WAS $500,000
FOR 20% EQUITY,
YOU'RE STILL THE 80% OWNER,
AND MY PARTNER MARK AND I
APPLY A 15% ROYALTY
JUST TILL WE GET
OUR $500,000 BACK.
THAT'S ALL.
AND THAT ROYALTY??
(Daymond) THE SECOND??
EXCUSE ME.
AND THE SECOND OFFER
IS THE SAME THING.
EXCUSE ME. BEFORE YOU START,
LET ME FINISH WITH ONE THOUGHT
THAT'S GONNA STICK
IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND.
THERE'S ONLY TWO SHARKS HERE
THAT HAVE EVER SOLD A COMPANY
FOR OVER A BILLION DOLLARS.
I'M ONE. CUBAN'S THE OTHER GUY.
ALL RIGHT? IT'S BILLIONS. "B."
EVERYBODY ELSE IS AN "M."
MILLIONS. SMALL. BIG.
BIG DIFFERENCE.
YOU WANT
THE BILLION?DOLLAR PARTNERS
NOT THE SMALL FRY.
(Daymond) I'VE SOLD BILLIONS.
I'VE SOLD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
WORTH OF PRODUCT,
AND STILL DOING IT NOW,
ACTUALLY, IN ASIA RIGHT NOW.
SO I HAVE THE OFFER
OF $1 MILLION,
30% OF THE COMPANY
AND THE SAME ROYALTY FEE,
BUT LESS THAN THEIRS??
10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I RECOUP THE MONEY.
JOE, A FUNDAMENTALLY
FIRST DIFFERENCE
IN THE THREE OFFERS IS, ONE IS
TO SELL YOUR WHOLE BUSINESS.
MY OFFER IS $2 MILLION
FOR THE ENTIRE BUSINESS.
YOU GET A 10% ROYALTY.
YOU'RE THE GUY THAT RUNS IT.
ANY INTEREST IN SELLING
THE ENTIRE BUSINESS TODAY,
WHICH IS THE ROAD THAT
I'M TRYING TO GO DOWN?
NOT FOR $2 MILLION.
(laughs)
WOULD YOU GO TO $4 MILLION?
THAT'S WHY I?I HAVEN'T
SAID YES. THAT'S WHY I'M??
JOE, ARE YOU GONNA SELL
THIS BUSINESS TODAY OR NOT?
POSSIBLY. VERY POSSIBLY.
I B??
BELIEVE THAT, UM,
THE $4 MILLION IS A LITTLE LOW.
BUT I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE.
UM, I THINK IF YOU WENT
TO $5 MILLION AND 15%,
AND WHETHER YOU WANT ME
AS AN EMPLOYEE,
WHICH I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DO
AS AN EMPLOYEE AND CONTRACT,
BECAUSE I WANT MY ROYALTY
TO BE AS MUCH AS I CAN.
I CAN GET MY MIND AROUND
THE $4 MILLION.
I CAN'T
GO UP TO THE $5 MILLION.
SO I'M OUT.
DANG.
LISTEN, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?
OKAY.
SO LISTEN, IT'S A VERY SIMPLE
DISCUSSION AMONGST US.
VERY OFTEN, THE BEST STRATEGY IS
TO TAKE A COMPETITOR LIKE YOU,
EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES,
I FIND YOU DISTASTEFUL??
I SAY BRING HIM INTO THE DEAL
AT OUR PRICE.
GET HIM BACKED OUT OF THIS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, D. J.?
UH, BUT WE NEED TO GO UP ON
THE EQUITY. YOU GUYS WANTED 20%.
THAT'S INTERESTING.
WELL??
BRING HIM FOR A THIRD
AND GO UP TO 25%?
WELL, NO, NO, I?I THINK
YOU GAVE AWAY THE FARM.
YOU??YOU??IT WAS
SO UNKEVIN?LIKE WHEN YOU SAID
15% ONLY TILL
WE GET OUR MONEY BACK.
ONCE WE BRING
DAYMOND INTO OUR TENT,
WE??WE'RE THE ONLY OFFER LEFT,
WE CAN CHANGE OUR DEAL.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
JOE, LISTEN...
JOE, YOU GOTTA SAY
YES OR NO.
THIS??LIFE IS LIKE BUSINESS,
IT'S 20% WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU
AND 80% HOW YOU RESPOND.
YOU HAVE A MOMENT RIGHT NOW
TO TAKE THIS DEAL.
WILL YOU TAKE IT?
DOES IT COME
WITH SEASON TICKETS?
ABSOLUTELY.
THEN YOU GOT A DEAL.
(Daymond) AMEN.
(laughing)
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
REALLY GREAT JOB.
APPRECIATE IT. I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER.
(Mark) ABSOLUTELY.
(Robert) GOOD JOB, JOE.
THANK YOU.
PLEASURE MEETING YOU.
(Barbara) DID YOU GIVE HIM
THE SEASON TICKETS?
THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT'S
REMARKABLE. I JUST OFFERED A GUY
$4 MILLION, WHICH IS ABOUT
AS HIGH AS I WAS GONNA GO??
BUT THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THIS SHOW.
THIS GUY WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
WALKED IN
AND HAD THE CHOICE
TO BE A MILLIONAIRE...
AND HE STUCK WITH IT.
AND HE STUCK TO HIS GUNS
AND HE BELIEVED IN HIMSELF.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
THIS COUNTRY GREAT.
I FEEL WARM AND FUZZY.
I JUST MADE SOME MONEY.
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY,
TO TURN DOWN $4 MILLION
WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY I DID.
IT WAS SOMETHING
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I STILL GOT THREE?QUARTERS
OF A MILLION DOLLARS,
AND I STILL OWN 70%
OF THE NEXT BIGGEST THING
THAT THIS WORLD'S EVER SEEN.
