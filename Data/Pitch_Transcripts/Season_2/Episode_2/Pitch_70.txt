HEY, GUYS.
MY NAME IS BRIAN SPENCER.
I'M THE FOUNDER
AND CHIEF TEST PILOT
FOR VURTEGO POGO STICKS.
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
IS A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
FOR 20% OF THE COMPANY.
ALL THESE KIDS AND ADULTS
THAT PARTICIPATE IN THINGS
LIKE BMX AND??AND MOTOCROSS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,
THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE NEXT BIG THING,
THE NEXT SORT OF EVOLUTION
OF ACTION SPORTS.
THIS COULD BE THAT THING.
WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU
A VIDEO RIGHT HERE
OF SOME OF THE STUFF KIDS ARE
DOING AROUND THE WORLD ALREADY.
BY THE WAY,
DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.
UH, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT,
UH, YOU SHOULD DO
UNLESS YOU'RE PROFESSIONALS
LIKE THESE GUYS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
(Robert) OH, COOL.
OH, THAT IS SO COOL.
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS REINVENTED THE POGO STICK.
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
UH, WE'VE SOLD ABOUT 7,000.
NOBODY'S INJURED THEMSELVES?
HEY, YOU KNOW, SKATEBOARDS??
PEOPLE GET HURT ON SKATEBOARDS.
THESE ARE, UH,
DECEPTIVELY SAFE.
AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE, UM,
YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH SPEED.
YOU'RE DEALING WITH
JUST GOING UP AND DOWN.
AND WHAT'S THE TYPICAL
RETAIL PRICE?
$330.
WHAT'S IT COST TO MAKE IT?
COST ABOUT 100 BUCKS.
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S OTHER
POGO STICKS.
THERE IS A COMPETITOR THAT,
UH, USES RUBBER BANDS.
THE BIGGEST POGO STICK COMPANY
IN THE WORLD, BY THE WAY.
THEY SELL MILLIONS
OF POGO STICKS EVERY YEAR.
WE PLAN ON REPLACING THEM
AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
POGO STICK MANUFACTURER.
(Robert)
IS THIS A MASS?MARKET PRODUCT,
OR COULD YOU CONTINUE DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
SELLING 300,000 TO 400,000
A YEAR,
BUT MAKING SPECIALIZED,
MORE EXP??
'CAUSE HONESTLY, WHEN YOU
TOLD ME IT WAS ONLY $300,
AS A SPECIALTY PRODUCT,
THAT SEEMED CHEAP TO ME.
THE SAME REASON
WHY MOST KIDS DON'T BUY
A $5,000 MOUNTAIN BIKE??
YOU KNOW, THEIR PARENTS BUY 'EM
A $500 BMX BIKE.
UM, IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY
WITH THIS,
WE DO HAVE TO APPROACH
THE MASSES.
WHY DON'T YOU STAY
IN THAT SPACE, OWN IT,
MAKE FANTASTIC MARGINS...
WE'RE GONNA DO BOTH.
AND BUILD 'EM IN CALIFORNIA
AND BE HAPPY WITH THAT?
WE'RE GONNA DO BOTH.
I MEAN, A STRATEGY
WHERE YOU WANT TO GO COMPETE
AND SELL IT IN TOY STORES
AND HAVE MASS DISTRIBUTION??
IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT BUSINESS.
(Mark) LOOK,
I'LL JUST TELL YOU,
YOU CAN BE A VICTIM
OF YOUR OWN SUCCESS.
I MEAN,
WHEN YOU'RE COOL AND HIP,
I BRING YOU DOWN
TO A MAVS GAME??
WE ALREADY ARE COOL AND HIP.
RIGHT.
SEE, THAT'S THE POINT.
WHEN YOU GO MASS MARKET,
YOU LOOSE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.
TO BE ABLE
TO MAINTAIN YOUR COOLNESS
AND SEGREGATE INTO AN ENTIRE
DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMPANY
THAT GOES MASS MARKET,
AND TO DO IT WITH,
YOU KNOW, $500,000 ONLY,
THAT'S NOT AN EASY TASK.
LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OF INVESTORS
ON THIS SIDE OF THESE TABLES.
EVERYBODY'S IN SYNC
ON THE SAME PLACE.
THEY DON'T SEE YOUR VISION
FOR THE LOW END.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
DON'T YOU SEE IT?
AS I'M??AS I'M LISTENING
TO YOU GUYS,
UH, I?I?I AGREE.
IT'S HARD NOT TO AGREE.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WANT TO SEE.
I WANT TO SEE THE PRICE
OF THESE THINGS GO UP BY 100%.
THEY'RE $600 NOW.
I?I KEEP TELLING PEOPLE THAT,
AND PEOPLE SAY, "NO, YOU GOTTA
GO MASS MARKET," BUT??
NO, YOU DON'T.
IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE
THAT SOME KID DIDN'T GET KILLED
ON THIS ALREADY.
NOW MAYBE I'M A PROTECTIVE MOM.
GRANTED, I AM. OKAY?
WELL, IF IT'S NOT MOTHER
APPROVED, THAT'S GOOD FOR US.
NO KIDDING.
(Robert) YEAH.
I'M OUT.
(Mark)
HERE??HERE'S WHERE I'M AT??
ONCE YOU BRING ONE OF US IN,
ESPECIALLY THIS GUY, RIGHT,
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT'S NOT ABOUT COOL.
NO. YOU GOTTA MAKE SOME MONEY.
IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.
IT'S ABOUT CASH.
WELL, COMING TO THE SHARKS,
I WAS EXPECTING, YOU KNOW,
UM, FOR THE MENTALITY TO BE
MORE MASS MARKET.
WE GOTTA SELL
A TON OF THESE THINGS...
(snaps fingers)
AND MAKE A MILLION BUCKS.
(Mark) THAT'S EVEN WORSE,
THOUGH, BRIAN.
THAT'S EVEN WORSE. BE YOU. WHEN
YOU TRY TO PLEASE EVERYBODY,
YOU END UP PLEASING NOBODY.
THAT'S WHY I'M OUT.
(mouths word)
BRIAN, I DON'T WANT
TO CRUSH THE POGO GUYS.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
YEAH.
YOU SHOULD GET OUT THERE,
BRING OUT THE BOOST AT $1,200,
EVERY KID AND HIS DOG
IS GONNA WANT ONE.
THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT HOW TO
SELL THEIR SISTER TO BUY IT,
AND YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
AN OBSCENE PROFIT.
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
$500,000. I'M OUT.
I HAVE TO SOUND LIKE
THE REST OF THE GUYS.
THE PRODUCT IS GREAT, YOU'RE
DOING SALES, YOU DON'T NEED US.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
BRIAN, YOU ARE THE ULTIMATE
IN COOL??COOL PRODUCT,
YOUR HAIR IS COOL,
YOU GOT THE WHOLE LOOK.
(laughs)
EVERYBODY'S RIGHT. THE MINUTE
YOU TRY TO GO MASS MARKET,
IT'S A GUY IN A SUIT
SELLING ON WALL STREET.
I WISH I WAS INVOLVED
IN SOME WAY, BUT I'M OUT.
CAN I BUY THAT ONE
BEFORE YOU GO TODAY?
SURE. MAKE YOU A SPECIAL DEAL.
1,200 BUCKS.
YEAH.
(all laugh)
YOU'RE A SHARK.
(Daymond) ALL RIGHT, BRIAN.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, BRIAN.
APPRECIATE IT, BUDDY.
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.
WELL, THE SHARKS DIDN'T
GIVE ME A DEAL,
BUT THEY GAVE ME SOME GREAT
ADVICE. I LOVE WHAT THEY TOLD ME
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
MAINTAINING THAT POSITION
AS THE CRËME DE LA CRËME
IN THE INDUSTRY.
