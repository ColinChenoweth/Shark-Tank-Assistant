MY NAME IS MATTY SALLIN,
AND I'M FROM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.
BY DAY, I'M A DESIGNER
FOR A BIG SOFTWARE COMPANY.
BUT IN MY SPARE TIME,
I'M ALWAYS COMING UP
WITH NEW PRODUCT IDEAS.
MY PRODUCT
IS A DEVICE FOR THE HOME,
AND IT'S GONNA CHANGE THE WAY
AMERICANS START THEIR DAY.
(beeping)
ANNOYING ALARM CLOCKS ARE
A HORRIBLE WAY TO START THE DAY.
SO I'VE CREATED SOMETHING
THAT'LL MAKE YOU
ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD
TO WAKING UP.
(sizzling)
MY PRODUCT TAKES
A UNIQUE APPROACH
ON WAKING UP IN THE MORNING.
IT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND.
I'VE TAKEN MY PRODUCT
AS FAR AS I CAN ON MY OWN.
I NEED THE EXPERTISE,
THE CONNECTIONS, AND THE MONEY
THAT THE SHARKS HAVE TO HELP ME
GET THIS MASS PRODUCED.
THAT WOULD BE
A DREAM COME TRUE OF MINE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MATTY SALLIN,
AND MY PRODUCT IS CALLED
WAKE N' BACON.
(laughs)
I'M ASKING FOR $40,000
IN RETURN FOR 20% EQUITY.
SO... WHILE I WAS GETTING
MY MASTER'S DEGREE
AT N. Y. U. UNIVERSITY,
I TOOK AN INTRODUCTORY
ELECTRONICS COURSE
WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE
A DEVICE FOR THE HOME.
AND I WANTED TO REMAKE
AN ALARM CLOCK.
AND SO I CANVASSED
MY FELLOW STUDENTS,
ASKING THEM WHAT THEIR IDEAL WAY
TO WAKE UP WAS.
NOW I CAN'T SAY
WHAT THE NUMBER ONE ANSWER WAS
ON TELEVISION...
(laughs)
BUT THE CLOSE SECOND
WAS THE SMELL
AND TASTE OF BACON.
AND SO, INSPIRED,
I WENT HOME AND I BUILT
THE WORLD'S FIRST ALARM CLOCK
THAT ACTUALLY WAKES YOU UP
WITH BACON.
(laughs)
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS??
SO THE NIGHT BEFORE,
YOU OPEN UP THE CHAMBER,
AND YOU PUT IN A COUPLE
OF SLICES OF PRECOOKED BACON,
AND THEN YOU SET THE ALARM
FOR SAY 7:00 A. M.
THE NEXT MORNING AT 6:50,
THE CLOCK SILENTLY TURNS ON,
AND IT HEATS UP THE BACON
TO A CRISP
SO THAT THE SMELL
IS REALLY STRONG
AND CAN WAKE UP
ANY BACON LOVER.
(laughs)
YOU CAN THEN ACTUALLY
JUST ROLL OVER IN BED,
OPEN IT UP,
AND EAT THE BACON YOURSELF.
YOU CAN COOK THE BACON
AND THEN EAT IT.
I'M SERIOUS. I BUILT THIS,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A LARK,
SO I POSTED IT ON MY WEB SITE,
AND WAKE N' BACON WENT VIRAL.
I'VE BEEN INUNDATED WITH
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF E?MAILS
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGGING ME
TO SELL THEM ONE.
AND SO WITH THE MONEY
I'M ASKING FOR,
I WANT TO REDESIGN THIS
FOR MASS PRODUCTION
AND GET A FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE
SO THAT I CAN GO PITCH THIS
TO RETAIL PARTNERS
AND MANUFACTURING PARTNERS
AND INVESTORS.
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT
AN ARTIST RENDERING
OF WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE
IF MASS PRODUCED.
NOTICE THE HOOVES.
AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
WITH THE TRAY OPEN.
AND THE CORD
IS A LITTLE CORKSCREW.
I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.
(laughs)
CAN WE TRY IT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY??
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
IN FACT, UM, I'VE GOT
SOME FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
HEY, MATTY, I?I LOVE
THE FACE OF THE PIG.
DO YOU HAVE A SLOGAN FOR THIS
OR ANYTHING?
RISE AND SWINE.
(sharks laugh)
OH, LORDY.
(laughs)
MATTY, HOW LONG
DOES IT TAKE TO COOK?
UH, IT TAKES TEN MINUTES
TO REHEAT.
SO, MATTY, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
WE'VE SOLD 10,000 OF THESE,
AND THE TEN THOUSAND AND FIRST
CATCHES ON FIRE
AND BURNS A COUPLE
TO DEATH IN THEIR BED?
WELL, IT NEEDS??IT??
IT HAS TO BE U. L. LISTED,
WHICH MEANS IT'S SAFE
FOR THE HOME,
FOR ANY ELECTRONICS DEVICE.
YEAH, BUT I'M GONNA ASK YOU??
YOU THINK THEY WANT AN OVEN
COOKING BACON
NEXT TO A BED?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
THE EASY?BAKE OVEN OUT THERE??
BUT NOT NEXT TO SOMEBODY'S BED
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE A KID'S
GONNA PUT THE EASY?BAKE OVEN.
IF THEY??IF THEY MADE IT
THROUGH THAT,
THEN I'M SURE
THAT I CAN FIND A WAY
TO GET THIS U. L. LISTED
AND SAFE FOR THE HOME.
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
OF PRICING?
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR MARGINS WILL BE?
SO IT'D BE
ABOUT $13 PER UNIT.
I MEAN,
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $40,000.
SO ONCE YOU BURN THROUGH
THE $40,000
TO MAKE THE PROTOTYPE,
WHERE'S THE MONEY GONNA COME
FROM TO SELL IT?
I WANT THE MONEY SO THAT
I CAN THEN PITCH THIS
TO RETAIL PARTNERS
AND MANUFACTURING PARTNERS.
(Mark) MATTY, LET ME SEE
IF I GET THIS RIGHT.
THIS IS A NOVELTY ITEM.
YES.
YOU THINK YOU CAN SELL
HOW MANY UNITS?
I'M NOT SURE??
I DON'T HAVE A PROJECTION
OF HOW MANY UNITS
I COULD SELL.
AT LEAST THROW OUT A FORECAST.
SAY 1.26 MILLION
IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
EVEN IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME,
AT LEAST THAT'S INTERESTING.
YOU GOT NO PROJECTIONS
WHATSOEVER.
YOU GOT A PIG BOX THAT'S GONNA
CATCH ON FIRE AND KILL SOMEBODY.
I'M GONNA BE SUED
INTO THE STONE AGE.
I'M OUT, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU
100 BUCKS FOR THE PIG BOX.
IS THE PIG BOX FOR SALE?
UH, NO.
IT'S THE ONLY ONE I HAVE.
(Daymond laughs)
MATTY, I THINK YOUR IDEA
IS WHIMSICAL,
AND IT'S A GREAT NOVELTY GIFT.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S MY COMPLIMENT. I DON'T
THINK ANYONE REALLY WANTS
TO HAVE BACON THAT CLOSE
WHEN THEY'RE WAKING UP.
I THINK THEY LIKE SMELLING IT
IN THE KITCHEN,
THAT MOM'S MAKING,
SO I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M TAKING MY PIECE OF BACON
AND I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
I LIKE PIG??
I LIKE BACON.
(laughs)
GET ON IT. IN OR OUT?
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, MATTY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE MINIMUM PRODUCTION RUN IS?
UM, I THINK IT'S??10,000
IS THE LOWEST I COULD GO.
SO THAT MEANS
IF YOUR FULL COST FOR THESE
IS 15 BUCKS A UNIT BASICALLY?
13 BUCKS A UNIT,
SO IT'D BE $130,000.
WHERE IS THAT MONEY
COMING FROM?
THAT'S WHERE I NEED TO PARTNER
WITH A RETAIL PARTNER
OR A MANUFACTURING PARTNER
OR AN INVESTOR.
YOU NEEDED TO KNOW??
MARK, YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT
YOUR NAME ON THIS, 'CAUSE I'M
GONNA SUE YOU INTO THE STONE AGE
AFTER MY BED CATCHES ON FIRE.
I KNOW HOW TO BUY INSURANCE,
SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT.
THE BIGGER PROBLEM
THAT I HAVE LITERALLY??
AND BEING VERY INTERESTED??
IS, YOU NEEDED $170,000.
YOU ONLY ASKED FOR $40,000.
I'M NOW ASKING FOR $170,000.
(sharks laugh)
MARK, ARE YOU REALLY
INTERESTED IN THIS?
I LIKE THE IDEA.
YOU REALLY THINK COOKING BACON
BEDSIDE IS A GOOD IDEA?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
'CAUSE IF I HAD TO GUESS,
THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE
WHO WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE BACON,
I'D SAY 10%.
AND IF HAD TO GUESS
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO WOULD MAKE BACON TWICE,
I'D SAY 0%.
HOW MANY PERCENT
SET THE HOUSE ON FIRE?
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M??
THE POINT, THOUGH, IS,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA USE IT
TO MAKE BACON.
THIS IS GONNA BE A PRESENT FOR
DAD BECAUSE IT'S SO DARN STUPID.
(Barbara laughs)
AND MARK CUBAN PUTS HIS DOUGH
INTO STUPID IDEAS?
IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING
HERE TODAY?
IT'S A GAG GIFT.
THE PROBLEM IS, I'M NOT GONNA
PUT UP THE $130,000.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
BECAUSE OF THAT, MATTY,
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
OKAY. I'LL GIVE YOU 200 BUCKS
FOR THE PIG BOX.
LISTEN, I THINK I'M GONNA SAVE
CHILDREN BY DOING THAT.
WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT
IN MY MUSEUM OF REALLY BAD IDEAS
THAT DIDN'T KILL PEOPLE.
OKAY.
300 BUCKS FOR THE PIG BOX.
MATTY, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
(Mark) GOOD LUCK, MATTY.
(Daymond) GOOD LUCK, MAN.
THANK YOU.
