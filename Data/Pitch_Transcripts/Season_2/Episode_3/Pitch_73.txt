HELLO. MY NAME IS EMILY JOHNSON.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND ROBIN,
AND THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN
ERIN, LACHLAN, AND JAKE.
WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT
OUR NEW PRODUCT CALLED FLIPOUTZ.
IT ALL STARTED THREE YEARS AGO
ON A LONG CAR TRIP.
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS GET
ON A LONG CAR TRIP.
AND IN AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE
A LITTLE PEACE IN THE BACKSEAT,
I CHALLENGED THE KIDS
TO COME UP
WITH THEIR VERSION
OF THE PERFECT TOY OR GAME.
AND THIS IS WHAT RESULTED
FROM THAT DISCUSSION.
THE KIDS' COMPANY
IS CALLED FLIPOUTZ,
AND THEY ARE SEEKING
A $100,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 20%
EQUITY STAKE IN THE COMPANY.
HI, GUYS. I'M LACHLAN,
AND I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE NEXT BIG THING
FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES??
FLIPOUTZ.
FLIPOUTZ IS
A SILICONE BRACELET
THAT HOLDS FIVE
PERSONALIZED COINS
THAT KIDS WEAR, TRADE,
AND THEN TRACK ONLINE
AT THE FLIPOUTZ WEB SITE.
THANK YOU, LACHLAN.
YOU ARE WELCOME.
I'M ERIN JOHNSON,
AND MY CONTRIBUTION
TO THE PROJECT WAS
A LITTLE MORE ARTISTIC
WITH THE NOTION
OF SELF?EXPRESSION.
EACH COIN HAS ITS OWN CUSTOMIZED
ARTWORK OR POSITIVE MESSAGE
THAT'S MEANT TO REPRESENT
WHO YOU ARE OR YOUR INTERESTS,
OR HOBBIES OR TRAITS. AND THEN
ON THE BACK OF EACH COIN
IS A 10?DIGIT CODE THAT ALLOWS
KIDS TO TRACK THEIR COIN ONLINE
AS IT GETS TRADED
AROUND THE WORLD.
I'M JAKE. I WANTED A TOY THAT
HAD A GAMING OR TRADING ASPECT.
AND WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS
WITH THE FLIPOUTZ WEB SITE.
THE FLIPOUTZ WEB SITE
WEB 2.0 COMMUNITY,
WHERE KIDS CAN CREATE A PROFILE
PAGE, BLOG, CHAT WITH FRIENDS,
GIVE AND RECEIVE STATUS UPDATES,
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
NAME, DESCRIBE,
AND TRACK YOUR COINS ONLINE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU, JAKE?
I AM 11.
I'M AMAZED THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING WITH YOUR SISTER.
'CAUSE I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS
AND THEY CAN'T GET ALONG
FOR MORE THAN...
OH, WE HAVE OUR MOMENTS.
(laughs)
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES TODAY?
OH, YES.
WELL, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS??
UH, WE'VE ONLY BEEN SELLING
FOR SIX MONTHS??BUT WE'VE MADE
ALMOST $20,000.
YOU'VE MADE
OR YOU'VE SOLD $20,000?
SOLD $20,000.
AND WHERE DID YOU SELL IT?
MAINLY OFF OF THE WEB SITE.
BUT WE'RE ALSO
IN A FEW...
WE'RE ALSO PARTNERED WITH
A SALES/BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVE,
AND, UM, A SOUVENIR
DISTRIBUTING COMPANY
WHO PUTS IT IN, YOU KNOW,
THEME PARKS, AQUARIUMS, ZOOS,
UM, HOPEFULLY, WE'LL BE IN
THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME
VERY SOON.
SO WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE THESE
AND WHAT DO THEY SELL FOR?
THE BRACELET AND ONE COIN
WE CAN MAKE FOR 69 CENTS.
THE BRACELET, RETAIL, IS $4.99.
WELL, I THINK THE REAL
COMPETITION TODAY IS
THOSE BANDS THAT YOU BUY,
YOU KNOW...
SILLY BANDZ.
SILLY BANDZ. MY KIDS
GO NUTS FOR THOSE.
(Erin) THIS IS THE NEXT
SILLY BAND.
RIGHT. NEXT BIG SILLY BANDZ.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME,
WHY WOULD A KID TRADE THE COIN?
DOES IT BECOME PERSONALIZED
IN SOME SENSE?
UM, YES.
THE COIN HAS THE CODE ON
THE BACK, WHICH??ON THE WEB SITE
YOU CAN ENTER THAT CODE
AND THAT COIN WILL POP UP,
NOW YOU CAN PERSONALIZE
THE COIN, WRITE SOMETHING
ABOUT IT, AND THEN
ONCE YOU TRADE THE COIN,
YOU KNOW, THAT PERSON IS GOING
TO GET THAT MESSAGE FIRST,
AND THEN THEY CAN WRITE
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
AND THEN THEY CAN WRITE
SOMETHING...
SO YOU REALLY CREATE, LIKE,
A HISTORY WITH EACH COIN.
YES.
ARE PEOPLE FOLLOWING THIS
NOW ONLINE?
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND HOW DID YOU GET THOSE
PEOPLE TO FIND IT ONLINE?
UM, WE GAVE IT
TO OUR WHOLE SCHOOL,
WHICH??WE GO TO A SMALL??
VERY SMALL SCHOOL.
BUT WE ALSO LIVE IN
A COLLEGE TOWN.
UM, THE COLLEGE KIDS LOVE IT,
SO...
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU SPENT
UP UNTIL THIS POINT?
UM,WELL, OBVIOUSLY, REALLY,
WEHAVEN'T SPENT ANYTHING.
BUT OUR PARENTS' MONEY??OUR
PARENTS HAVE INVESTED ABOUT
$250,000 IN THIS SO FAR.
WOW.
WOW.
SO, ROBIN,
WHERE'D THE MONEY GO?
WEB SITE DEVELOPMENT
WAS EXPENSIVE
AND PATENT ATTORNEYS
WERE EXPENSIVE.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE EVER HAD CHILDREN
IN THE SHARK TANK, I GOTTA SAY.
(Johnsons laugh)
AND SMART ONES AT THAT.
LET'S TALK TO THE PARENTS
FOR A SECOND.
YOU??YOU'VE SPENT $250,000.
MM?HMM.
THAT'S SERIOUS MONEY.
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
THIS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL?
I MEAN, THIS IS A??
THIS IS REALLY A TCHOTCHKE.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT.
THE TRACKING AND TRADING IS
WHAT??WE HAVE A PATENT PENDING
ON THE TRACKING/TRADING PROCESS.
SO THAT'S THE KEY.
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
THE BRACELET AND THE COINS.
WHA??WHAT??
WE CAN PUT THE CODE ON ANYTHING,
TO TRACK AND TRADE ANYTHING,
AND WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
THAT CAN DO THAT.
SO CAN YOU EXPAND
ON THAT A LITTLE BIT?
YOU CAN TRACK AND TRADE
ANYTHING RELATED TO KIDS?
ANYTHING. ANY TCHOTCHKE.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ONE OF??
THAT'S A VERY VALUABLE PATENT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
COULD YOU PUT THAT ON
BASEBALL CARDS, IF THEY WERE...
EXACTLY.
I THINK THE PATENT
COULD BE WORTH MONEY
OR MAYBE NOTHING AT ALL,
BUT I THINK THE PROOF IS IN
THE APPLICATION OF THE PATENT,
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS
IS THE RIGHT APPLICATION,
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS
AN ENORMOUS MARKETING PLAY
THAT'S GONNA TAKE
A TON OF MONEY??
MORE MONEY THAN YOU'RE GONNA
BE WILLING TO GIVE. I'M OUT.
HEY, JAKE, YOU REMIND ME
OF MYSELF.
I WAS A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR
JUST LIKE YOURSELF.
AND I'D LIKE TO COMMEND
THE WHOLE FAMILY
FOR THIS ENTERPRISE.
BUT $100,000...
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH.
I THINK IT'S TOO RISKY
FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.
CAN I ADD ONE THING?
THERE??WE HAD INTEREST
FROM ANOTHER COMPANY
WHO WANTS TO MAKE??WE DON'T HAVE
THE PURCHASE ORDER IN HAND??
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF CLOSING
THIS PURCHASE ORDER.
25 MILLION COINS
AND 2 TO 3 MILLION BRACELETS.
WHO'S GONNA PAY
FOR THAT INVENTORY?
THEY'RE GONNA PAY
FOR 30% OF IT UP FRONT.
I WOULD COME IN
FOR $100,000 FOR 33%
BECAUSE THINK THAT
WHAT YOU NEED
IS THE EXPERTISE
TO HELP NAVIGATE ALL THIS,
AS WELL AS DO
SOME PRODUCTION YOURSELVES.
ANY PARTNER HAS TO HAVE
MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION
SO YOU CAN PUT IT EVERYWHERE.
DAYMOND HAS SOME OF THAT
DISTRIBUTION.
I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH,
IF IT'S THE RIGHT KIND
OF DISTRIBUTION.
YEAH, BUT IT'S REALLY
NOT YOUR BUSINESS
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE 'EM AN OFFER.
GUYS, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
I HAVE AN OFFER ON THE TABLE.
33%, $100,000,
CONTINGENT ON THE PATENT.
WE'RE A TEAM, AND WE'D REALLY
LIKE TO SEE A TEAM HERE, TOO.
OH, YOU'D LIKE
MORE THAN ONE SHARK.
(Robin) IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.
WELL, I COULD GO IN WITH ROBERT
ON THIS THING,
WE'D BLOW DAYMOND OUT. WE DON'T
NEED HIM. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK...
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT WORK.
IT'S THE LITTLE DEVIL ON MY
SHOULDER SAYING, "DO THE DEAL!
DO THE DEAL!"
AND THE OTHER ONE SAYS,
WHAT ARE YOU NUTS? YOU KNOW,
BESIDES BEING MR. WONDERFUL,
I'M ALSO MR. TOY.
I SOLD MY COMPANY TO MATTEL
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
I KNOW THOSE GUYS.
YOU WANNA GO 50/50
AND GET RID OF DAYMOND?
I'LL GO IN WITH YOU.
OKAY. LET'S??WE'LL DO
THE SAME PERCENTAGE.
BUT TWO SHARKS.
TWO SHARKS. YOU GET TWO.
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY?
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY,
AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH DAYMOND, WHICH IS ALWAYS??
THE PROBLEM IS, MY $100,000
NOW ONLY WANTS 25%.
UGH. LISTEN, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?
TAKE THE FAMILY OUTSIDE.
(Robin) YEAH.
(Lachlan) ALL RIGHT,
COME ON.
WHY ARE WE COMPETING? ALL RIGHT,
I THINK WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO HERE
IS THE THREE OF US ARE GONNA
GO IN A DEAL.
I WANT PART OF IT.
YEAH.
I THINK YOU ASK
FOR A LITTLE MORE MONEY.
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T WANNA
BLOW IT COMPLETELY.
WE HAVE THREE SHARKS ON BOARD.
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
WHAT IF THEY PULL THE OFFER
OFF THE TABLE, MAKE 'EM MAD?
YEAH. THEN YOU JUST
BLEW IT ALL.
SHARKS DO BITE!
THIS IS REALLY??
THIS IS STRESSFUL.
IT'S YOUR FUTURE.
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.
WHAT DO Y'ALL WANT TO DO?
ALL RIGHT, SO LIKE YOUR FAMILY,
WE'VE COME TOGETHER ON THIS,
BECAUSE IT'S BETTER
TO BE FRIENDS THAN ENEMIES.
IN THE END,
IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.
THAT'S HOW LIFE IS,
UNFORTUNATELY.
BUT ONCE YOU EMBRACE THAT TRUTH,
WONDERFUL THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
SO HERE IS THE OFFER.
THREE OF US ARE GONNA
COME IN ON THIS DEAL??
DAYMOND, MYSELF, ROBERT.
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 33% OF THIS COMPANY.
WE THINK IT'S A CRAPSHOOT. WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
BUT WE THINK THE REAL VALUE
IS IN THE PATENT.
AND IN THAT AREA,
WE'RE GREAT PARTNERS.
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL WORKED
IN THAT SPACE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
UM...
IT'S Y'ALL'S CALL.
UM, I THINK
WE'VE ALL AGREED
THAT WE'RE GONNA LOOK
FOR A LITTLE MORE MONEY.
(sharks) WHOA!
THAT IS REALLY SOMETHING.
WHAT'S THE COUNTER, JAKE?
150 FOR 33??
$150,000 FOR 33%
YOU KNOW, JAKE,
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING ENOUGH VALUE
ON WHAT WE BRING TO THE TABLE
JUST IN OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. DO
YOU HAVE ANYBODY ELSE YOU KNOW
THAT'S SOLD A $4 BILLION ASSET
TO A TOY COMPANY?
(singsongy) I DON'T THINK SO.
SO, KEVIN, I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING??
I'VE LEARNED THAT YOU ARE RIGHT.
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A FEEL?GOOD,
LOVE MOMENT HERE,
BUT GUESS WHAT?
YOU KNOW THE COLD,
HARD REALITY OF LIFE?
MAYBE IT REALLY IS??
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT?
MONEY.
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE ARE
STANDING UP FOR THE BUSINESS.
THIS BUSINESS ISN'T WORTH
THE MONEY YOU'RE ASKING FOR.
I WAS WILLING TO TAKE A LEAP OF
FAITH WITH YOU BECAUSE I WAS??
I'M GONNA STEP OUT.
I'M STEPPING OUT.
SO I DON'T WANT
TO NEGOTIATE WITH YOU.
WE MADE AN OFFER, SO I'M
GONNA STEP OUT ON YOUR COUNTER.
NOW YOU KIDS ARE SEEING
WHAT LIFE IS REALLY LIKE,
AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LESSON
FOR YOU. IN THE END,
IT'S ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY
ALL OF THE TIME.
NEVER FORGET THAT. IF YOU
CONSIDER OUR ORIGINAL OFFER,
WHICH WAS THREE SHARKS,
$100,000,
WITH THE CONTINGENCY
YOU CLEAR THAT PATENT.
THIS IS OUR LAST OFFER,
WE'RE NOT CHANGING IT.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
WHAT YOU GONNA DO?
WE ARE SO TAKING IT.
WE'RE TAKING IT.
(laughter)
(Robert and O'Leary) ALL RIGHT.
(Emily) YAY! ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
(Robin) THANK YOU.
(Erin) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S LOVE!
(Erin) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
(Robert) REALLY, WHOSE IDEA
WAS IT TO COME BACK AND COUNTER?
'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU CAME??
YOU CAME <i>THAT</i> CLOSE, MY FRIEND,
TO NOT GETTING A DEAL.
(Emily) I KNOW.
BUT... WE DID.
(Robin) WOW.
LET ME GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
YEAH, LET'S GO.
(Emily) THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
(Lachlan) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
YES!
WHOO!
THE KID IS A ROCK STAR.
WE GOT A DEAL!
(cheering)
AND I'M WONDERING IF BARBARA??
IF YOU'LL STEP UP
AND HELP ME FOR A MOMENT.
SURE. I'D BE HAPPY TO.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SPRAY ME,
ARE YOU?
I HAVE A BOTTLE
OF AMMONIA HERE... (chuckles)
(laughs)
THAT SIMULATES URINE.
URINE SMELLS ARE THE HARDEST
TO GET RID OF IN THE WORLD.
SO WHAT I DO IS, I SPRAY
A SPRAY OF AMMONIA ON A TISSUE.
AND I'LL LET YOU VERIFY
THAT IT SMELLS LIKE URINE.
(sniffs)
YEAH. WORSE.
NOW WITH PURE AYRE,
YOU SPRAY IT EVERYWHERE
WHERE THE SMELL
IS COMING FROM.
AND OUR LOGO ON OUR BOTTLE
ACTUALLY SHOWS YOU WHAT WE DO.
WE BREAK APART THE MOLECULES
THAT MAKE THE SMELL,
NOT COVER IT UP
WITH A CHEMICAL FRAGRANCE.
IT'S AMAZING.
IT SMELLS GREAT. REALLY.
IT IS AMAZING.
DID IT WORK, BARBARA?
YEAH. IT SMELLS GREAT.
IT'S TRULY THE ONLY 100%...
(sprays) FOOD?GRADE,
EDIBLE ODOR ELIMINATOR
ON THE MARKET TODAY.
WOW.
