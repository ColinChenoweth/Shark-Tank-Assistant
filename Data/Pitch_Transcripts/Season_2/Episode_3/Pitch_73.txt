MY NAME IS KIERSTEN AND I LIVE
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,
WITH MY HUSBAND
AND MY 12?YEAR?OLD SON
AND MY 8?YEAR?OLD DAUGHTER.
I LEFT MY JOB
TO STAY HOME WITH MY KIDS,
AND THEN MY HUSBAND
LOST HIS JOB,
AND SO WE DESPERATELY NEEDED
SOMETHING TO HELP PAY THE BILLS.
WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR IDEAS
ON HOW TO MAKE MONEY,
I REALIZED THAT THE ANSWER
WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS.
WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE,
I TAUGHT MYSELF CARPENTRY.
(machinery whirring)
I THINK MY PRODUCT COULD BE
THE NEXT BIG THING
IN HOME FURNISHINGS. I THINK
IT'S ALREADY HEADING THERE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BRAND
THAT'S RECOGNIZED.
I'VE BEEN SELLING MY PRODUCTS
SO MUCH FASTER
THAN I CAN BUILD THEM.
IF I DON'T GET A DEAL
FROM THE SHARKS,
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN
MAKE ALL OF THIS WORK ANYMORE.
I'M PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED.
WE NEED MONEY.
SO I NEED THE SHARKS' HELP
IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN,
AND HOPEFULLY I WON'T HAVE TO
GO OUT AND GET ANOTHER JOB.
HI. MY NAME IS
KIERSTEN HATHCOCK,
AND MY COMPANY
IS MOD MOM FURNITURE,
AND I AM SEEKING $90,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY.
IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME
TEN YEARS AGO THAT I WOULD HAVE
AN INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN
FURNITURE COMPANY
OUT OF MY GARAGE, I WOULD HAVE
SAID THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY,
BECAUSE TEN YEARS AGO I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT A JIGSAW WAS.
BUT JUST THREE YEARS AGO,
WE NEEDED A TOY BOX,
AND WE LOOKED ON THE MARKET.
WE WANTED IT TO FIT IN
WITH OUR MODERN STYLE.
COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
SO I TAUGHT MYSELF HOW TO DESIGN
AND BUILD MODERN TOY BOXES.
I WANTED TO MAKE THEM
ECO?FRIENDLY,
AND I WANTED TO MAKE THEM
SO THAT THEY WOULD LOOK GOOD
AND THEY WOULD ALSO BE
REALLY FUN FOR KIDS,
SO I DESIGNED THEM TO HAVE
A PUZZLE PIECE LID...
SO THE KIDS WOULD ACTUALLY
BE MORE ENTICED TO WANT
TO GO AND PUT TOYS AWAY,
WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT
OF A TOY BOX TO BEGIN WITH.
THE DEMAND IS THERE. PLEASE JOIN
ME IN MAKING MOD MOM FURNITURE
THE NEXT MILLION?DOLLAR
FURNITURE COMPANY.
PLEASE JOIN ME IN TELLING ME
ABOUT YOUR SALES.
SURE.
LAST YEAR, I MADE $34,000.
NOW THIS WAS ME BEING CAPPED AT
BASICALLY BUILDING THREE A WEEK.
I'M PRETTY MUCH COVERED
IN SAWDUST DAILY.
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE ORDERS.
I'M GETTING ORDERS
FROM CELEBRITIES.
I'VE TURNED AWAY, UM, RETAILERS
FROM 17 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. YOU'RE
BUILDING ALL THIS BY HAND?
BY HAND, IN MY GARAGE.
LIKE, YOURSELF?
MYSELF.
WEARING THAT DRESS?
NO.
(sharks laugh)
NO, NOR THE HEELS.
THIS IS A NEW THING FOR ME.
IT'S A GOOD LOOK, THOUGH.
THANK YOU. UM...
HOW DID YOU LEARN?
I TAUGHT MYSELF.
I'M KIND OF THAT PERSON.
DYE MY OWN HAIR. I TAUGHT MYSELF
HOW TO DO WEB SITE DESIGN.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I JUST DO,
SO I FIGURED??
THAT IS??
THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT COSTS YOU
TO MAKE ONE OF THOSE...
SURE.
INCLUDING YOUR TIME?
OR HAD YOU HIRED SOMEBODY??
FOR ME TO BUILD,
INCLUDING MY TIME,
THIS ONE WOULD BE ABOUT $115.
WHAT DOES EACH PIECE SELL FOR?
THIS PIECE SELLS FOR $475
AND THAT INCLUDES SHIPPING.
(Robert) HOW LONG DOES IT
TAKE YOU TO MAKE ONE BOX?
HOW MANY HOURS?
IN BETWEEN DOING ALL THE STUFF
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO AS A MOM,
IN AND OUT OF WORKING ON THESE
THINGS, COULD TAKE TEN HOURS.
TEN HOURS.
HOW DOES YOUR HUSBAND
FEEL ABOUT THAT AT HOME?
THAT'S A L??BIG COMMITMENT.
HE'S BEEN WONDERFUL.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE IN A POSITION
RIGHT NOW, HE'S LAID OFF.
THIS IS A HUGE, UM...
(voice breaks) SORRY.
IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
AND THIS IS??
EVERYTHING'S RIDING ON??ON THIS.
HE AND I ARE A TEAM,
AND HE SUPPORTS ME
AS MUCH AS I SUPPORT HIM,
AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN
FOR ALL OF US,
FOR MY ENTIRE FAMILY.
YOU MUST BE NEWLYWEDS.
(laughs) NO, 14 YEARS.
S?SO HE'S LOST HIS JOB?
HE'S LOST HIS JOB?
HE LOST HIS JOB.
KIERSTEN, I LOVE??
I LOVE YOUR STORY.
YOU KNOW, I THINK A GREAT
MARRIAGE IS??IS A PARTNERSHIP
WHERE, SOMEBODY FALLS DOWN,
THE OTHER PERSON PICKS UP.
MM?HMM.
I LOVE THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTRIBUTE.
I ONLY HAVE ONE ISSUE I'M
TRYING TO GET MY MIND AROUND.
OKAY. OKAY.
HOW DO WE SCALE?
WITH YOUR HELP, I CAN ACTUALLY
SET UP MANUFACTURING
WITH AN AMISH MANUFACTURER
IN OHIO,
WHICH IS WHERE
I'M FROM ORIGINALLY.
HE, UM, MY AMISH MANUFACTURER
SAID HE COULD MAKE
50 TO 100 TO 1,000,
UM, A WEEK, IF WE NEED TO,
AND I CAN ONLY MAKE
THREE A WEEK.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE $90,000?
$60,000 WOULD BE FOR CASE GOODS,
SO I'LL HAVE TO HAVE
THE MONEY UP FRONT TO SAY,
"OKAY, WE NEED TO MAKE A MINIMUM
OF 25 OF THIS TWIN BED."
UM, THERE WILL ALSO BE??
WHY BOTHER WITH BEDS
WHEN YOU'RE DOING SO WELL
WITH TOY BOXES RIGHT NOW?
THIS IS HOW I'M GONNA GROW.
THIS IS HOW IT'S GONNA
BECOME A BIG BRAND COMPANY.
KIERSTEN, I'VE NO DOUBT
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A SUCCESS ON YOUR HANDS.
YOU ALREADY HAVE IT.
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GROSSLY
UNDERESTIMATING THE AMOUNT
OF CASH YOU'RE GONNA NEED,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE DREAMING
ABOUT EXTENDING YOUR LINE.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
SO FOR THOSE REASONS, IT'S
JUST TOO RICH FOR ME. I'M OUT.
OKAY.
KIERSTEN, UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M PETRIFIED
OF THE FURNITURE BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD
OF THE AMISH FIREPLACE BUSINESS?
IT'S??IT WENT FROM
ZERO TO OVER $100 MILLION,
AND IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESS,
BECAUSE IT??
IT'S AN ENERGY?SAVING PITCH.
OKAY.
"BUY THIS FIREPLACE,
REDUCE YOUR HEATING BILL."
I DON'T SEE
THE TOY BOX BUSINESS
BEING THE SAME POP THAT
THAT BUSINESS HAS.
UM, I?I'M GONNA
SAY I'M OUT.
OKAY.
KIERSTEN, I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER
'CAUSE I LOVE YOUR STORY.
I REALLY DO.
IT'S??IT'S CAPTIVATING...
AND IT'S UNIQUE, AND IT'S...
AND YOU'RE PRETTY. TRUST ME.
OH, HERE WE GO AGAIN,
BARBARA.
IT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU'RE BR??YOU'RE LIKE
A BROKEN RECORD.
YOU INSULT EVERY WOMAN
OUT THERE WITH THAT CO??
IT'S??YOU KNOW, BARBARA,
THAT'S VERY SEXIST OF YOU, AND I
WANT YOU TO APOLOGIZE RIGHT NOW.
I WILL NOT.
(Barbara) IT'S AN ADVANTAGE.
PLAY IT UP.
ANYWAYS, LET'S GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS.
IGNORE HER. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT IN THIS DEAL.
THE BIG CHALLENGE WITH YOUR DEAL
IS LIQUIDITY. IN OTHER WORDS,
IF I GIVE YOU MY MONEY, GETTING
IT BACK COULD BE FOREVER...
RIGHT.
AND I LIKE MY CAPITAL
TO COME HOME,
JUST LIKE MY CHILDREN,
OCCASIONALLY.
SO THE WAY I'D LIKE TO STRUCTURE
THIS IS I'LL GIVE YOU THE 90K,
I WANT 33%, BUT I WANT
A ROYALTY ON MY MONEY.
EVERY UNIT SOLD, I'M GONNA GET
7 1/2% UNTIL I GET MY 90K BACK.
THEN THE ROYALTY GOES AWAY.
OKAY.
KIERSTEN,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
KIERSTEN,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $90,000 FOR 33%,
AND HERE'S WHY
I'M A BETTER PARTNER
AND WHY I UNDERSTAND
SMALL BUSINESS.
YOU CAN'T PAY A ROYALTY
WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT.
A SMALL BUSINESS NEEDS
TO REINVEST THE CASH.
I WANT A ROYALTY,
BUT ONLY IF WE GET ABOVE
A CERTAIN AMOUNT IN SALES.
ONCE THE BUSINESS IS HEALTHY,
MAYBE ONCE WE GET
ABOUT A HALF A MILLION IN SALES,
THEN WE'LL SIT DOWN
AND LOOK AT A ROYALTY.
THAT POINT IS EXACTLY WHY
MR. O'LEARY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW SMALL BUSINESSES WORK.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S INTERESTING
TO HEAR THAT,
BUT I'VE ACTUALLY
DONE THIS BEFORE...
MM?HMM.
MANY, MANY TIMES. AND??
YOU'VE MADE TOY BOXES?
NO, NO. I'VE BUILT DISTRIBUTION
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOUR CHALLENGES ARE.
TRUST ME, YOU NEED SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS HOW TOUGH IT CAN BE,
NOT JUST HOW EASY IT IS.
YOU NEED A GUY LIKE ME.
THAT 7 1/2% ROYALTY
IS THE DISCIPLINE
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO HAVE.
HANG ON.
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A WOMAN
WHO NEEDS TO LEARN DISCIPLINE
TO YOU, MY FRIEND?
IN LIFE,
THERE'S DEFINITIVE MOMENTS.
YOU ONLY GET A FEW OF THEM.
THIS IS YOURS, RIGHT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
I APPRECIATE BOTH OFFERS,
I REALLY DO,
ESPECIALLY IN THE POSITION
I'M IN RIGHT NOW.
I THINK THE BETTER OFFER
FOR ME IS ROBERT.
OF COURSE IT IS.
THANK YOU.
I'M VERY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.
THANK YOU, KIERSTEN.
THAT'S GREAT, YEAH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
GREAT STORY. I GOTTA LEARN
WHAT A JIGSAW IS.
THANK YOU.
OKAY, I'LL TEACH YA.
I'LL TEACH YA.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
GOOD LUCK. GREAT STORY.
THANK YOU. THIS IS
WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT??
PEOPLE STARTING
SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE THAT.
THIS IS HOW I STARTED,
THIS IS HOW YOU STARTED...
SHE PICKED THE WRONG PARTNER.
THAT'S HER PROBLEM.
HEH.
THIS IS HUGE FOR ME. UH...
SORRY. IT'S HUGE.
I'VE BUILT 328 TOY BOXES
WITH THESE HANDS...
AND THEY??IT??THEY??
IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S AMAZING.
I'M GONNA GO WITH ROBERT.
WHOO!
