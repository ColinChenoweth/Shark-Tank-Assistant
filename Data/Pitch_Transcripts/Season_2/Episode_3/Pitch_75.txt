HI, I'M JAMES MITCHELL.
MY COMPANY IS
PURE AYRE ODOR ELIMINATOR.
I'M SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY.
NOW PURE AYRE IS
THE ONLY SAFE AND NATURAL
ODOR ELIMINATOR
ON THE MARKET TODAY.
IT'LL WORK ON ANY SMELL
YOU HAVE.
ALL RIGHT, JAMES, IT'S SHOWTIME
NOW. DO YOU OWN THIS PATENT?
IT IS NOT PATENTED.
OH.
WHY ISN'T IT PATENTED?
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING
THAT YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE
EVERYTHING ABOUT
WHAT YOU HAVE.
AND THEN WHAT WOULD STOP
A LARGE CHEMICAL HOUSEHOLD
PRODUCTS COMPANY
FROM CHANGING
ONE INSIGNIFICANT INGREDIENT
AND STEALING WHAT I HAVE?
WELL, WHAT SALES DO YOU HAVE?
I CAN TELL YOU TO DATE,
I'VE SOLD ALMOST $3.2 MILLION
OF PURE AYRE.
WOW. THAT'S REALLY EXCITING.
WE'RE AVERAGING
ABOUT $19,000 A MONTH.
SORRY. SORRY, JAMES.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUR SALES
FOR <i>THIS</i> YEAR WERE $3.2 MILLION.
NO, SINCE INCEPTION.
OH. WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?
LAST YEAR WAS $315,000 SOLD??
WHAT WERE THEY THE YEAR BEFORE
THEY WERE $300,000?
THAT'S KIND OF AN EXCITING,
UM... MOMENT TO DISCUSS
BECAUSE THE YEAR BEFORE THAT,
THEY WERE OVER HALF A MILLION.
AND $160,000, $170,000 OF THAT
WAS TO WALGREENS NATIONWIDE??
6,000 STORES.
SO WHY DID THE SALES GO DOWN?
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY EXCITING.
IN MONTH TWO
OF US BEING ON THE SHELF,
IT WAS MADE AWARE TO ME
THAT A LARGE COMPETITOR
KNOWS I'M OUT THERE.
AND WE WERE MYSTERIOUSLY
TERMINATED FROM WALGREENS.
WHY DID THEY KICK YOU OUT?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
YOUR COMPETITORS??THEY DON'T
WANT THEIR BUSINESS GOING AWAY,
AND THEY'RE GREAT PARTNERS WITH
WALGREENS AND EVERYBODY ELSE.
AND THEY SAID IT'S TIME
TO SHUT YOU DOWN
AND CRUSH YOU LIKE
THE COCKROACH YOU ARE.
I HAD A C. E. O. THAT DID
THE BEST HE COULD,
BUT AFTER
THE WALGREENS EPISODE,
WE BROUGHT IN
A CONSULTING FIRM
TO TEACH US HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE
TO SUPPORT
NATIONAL RETAIL OPERATIONS.
WHAT WAS THEIR ANSWER?
$4 MILLION.
JAMES, DO YOU OWN 100%
OF THIS BUSINESS?
BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY ANGEL,
WE OWN 57%.
SORRY, BETWEEN YOU AND WHO?
I HAVE ANGEL.
INVESTOR.
WE STARTED, HE AND I,
TOGETHER ON 57%.
WHO OWNS THE REST?
A COMBINATION
OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU RAISE?
UH, IT WAS ABOUT $500,000
TO $600,000.
AND IT'S GONE?
IT'S GONE NOW, YES.
GONE ON WHAT?
THE PROBLEM IS,
WE GOT IT IN PIECES.
WE NEVER GOT A CHUNK.
YOU GOT KICKED OUT
OF A NATIONAL RETAILER.
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET BACK IN?
YOU KNOW, THE ECONOMY
SOON AFTER IN 2009,
STARTED HITTING THE SKIDS.
WE REFOCUSED.
WHO'S OUR PRIMARY CUSTOMER?
THEY'RE NATURALLY MINDED
OR GREEN?MINDED OR??
JAMES, IS THIS THE ONLY PRODUCT
IN THE WORLD
THAT IS ALL?NATURAL
THAT DOES THIS?
THIS IS THE ONLY FOOD?GRADE
ODOR ELIMINATOR TECHNOLOGY.
IS THERE ANOTHER PRODUCT
THAT <i>ISN'T</i> FOOD?GRADE
THAT I <i>CAN'T</i> SPRAY
INTO BARBARA'S MOUTH
BUT WILL STILL DO THE SAME JOB?
UM, I KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THAT COME TO US
HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH...
THERE ARE COMPETITORS.
THERE ARE COMPETITORS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ARE YOU READY TO LICENSE THIS
TO SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY
CAN GET DISTRIBUTION?
HOW ARE WE GLOSSING OVER
THIS FACT?
THEY RAISED $600,000.
THEY HIRED A PROFESSIONAL C. E. O.
I'M SURE THAT GUY DID THAT.
WELL, JAMES,
DID HE EVER GO
AND TALK ABOUT LICENSING
TO A LARGE
CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY?
NO, THIS WAS A GENTLEMAN??
NO, NO, NO. DON'T GIVE US
THE BACKGROUND.
JUST SAY "YES" OR "NO."
HE W??HE WAS NOT A C. E. O.
BEFORE THIS.
SO YOU HIRED A BOZO
WHO BLEW $600,000.
JAMES, TELL ME "YES" OR "NO."
DID HE GO AND CALL ON A LARGE
COMPANY TO TRY AND LI??
NO, HE DID NOT.
THAT WAS MY JOB.
THEY WHY DID HE GET FIRED
AND NOT YOU?
JAMES,
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING US.
WE JUST WANT "YES" OR "NO."
ANY ANYBODY IN YOUR COMPANY
OR AFFILIATED WITH YOUR COMPANY
TALKED TO A MAJOR PRODUCER
OF THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT?
(Robert) IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.
UM, MY FORMER C. E. O...
YES OR NO? YES OR NO?
UH...
TALKED TO A DIVISION...
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
A COMPANY THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH
THAT THEY HAVE MULTIPLE
DIVISIONS??NOT JUST RETAIL.
OKAY.
WHAT DID THEY SAY?
AND THEY SAID BASED
ON THE TESTING
THAT THEY HAD DONE SO FAR,
IT SHOWS IT'S
A VERY PROMISING OPPORTUNITY.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT OPPORTUNITY?
THAT WAS A WEEK AGO.
A WEEK??NO! LOOK, YOU'RE LIKE
A CLAM WE'VE BEEN PRYING OPEN.
(Robert) WOW!
WHY'S IT TAKE SO LONG TO GET
TO THE OBVIOUS PATH OF SUCCESS?
I JUST WANNA CLEAR THE FIELD
HERE A LITTLE.
I'M DEFINITELY OUT.
JAMES, YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
$600,000 OF INVESTORS' MONEY.
NOW YOU WANT $150,000.
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I'M OUT.
JAMES... HERE'S MY DEAL.
I THINK THE ONLY THING
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN EDUCATION
IS IGNORANCE,
AND YOU ARE IGNORANT
TO THIS MARKET.
I'LL BRING THAT KNOWLEDGE,
BUT I NEED 50%.
(O'Leary) HORRIFIC IDEA.
VERY BAD.
LET ME TELL YOU MY IDEA,
ALL RIGHT?
I'M GONNA BUY
THE WHOLE COMPANY??
100% FOR $150,000??
AND I'M GONNA FIRE YOU.
THIS IS THE BEST NEWS
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY,
BECAUSE I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU WITH
A 7% ROYALTY FOREVER??
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE??
OF WHAT I MAKE OFF THIS PRODUCT.
YOU'RE GONNA BE VERY RICH.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
I?IS THERE NOTHING VALUED
IN THE STAR POWER
THAT I HAVE??
YOU HAVE NO STAR POWER.
YOU'RE AN AWFUL SALESMAN.
YOU ARE.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY
TO ANSWER A QUESTION DIRECTLY.
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES
TO PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING
TO YOU?
IT MAKES THEM THINK
THAT YOU'RE SHIFTY.
JAMES, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT
'CAUSE YOU'RE FIRED
THE SECOND I BUY THE COMPANY.
WELL, I <i>DO</i> CARE ABOUT THAT
'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
IS HE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW
HE'S <i>REALLY</i> BAD AT HIS JOB...
WHO CARES?
SO I CAN MAKE AN OFFER?
OKAY, SO HOW CAN I
BE BAD AT MY JOB
WHEN I BUILT THIS MARKET
FROM SCRATCH IN THE NORTHWEST??
JAMES, YES OR NO? BECAUSE IT IS
ABOUT TO BE RETRACTED.
DAYMOND, WE HEARD YOUR OFFER.
WE HEARD KEVIN'S OFFER.
LET??LET ME JUST ASK A QUESTION
BEFORE I DECIDE
WHETHER I'M GONNA
MAKE AN OFFER OR NOT.
ARE YOU WILLING TO WALK AWAY?
JAMES, IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TODAY
CONTINGENT ON YOU BEING
AN EMPLOYEE IN THAT BUSINESS?
CONSUMERS OUT THERE
WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH,
AND THEY THERE'S SOME BIG
BROTHER WATCHING OVER THEM...
YES OR NO? YES OR NO?
AS FAR AS SAFETY
ON THE MARKET...
WHAT'S YOUR POINT
OUT OF ALL THIS?
AND THERE IS NOTHING??
WHY CAN YOU NEVER ANSWER
A QUESTION?
DAYMOND, HANG ON. YES OR NO?
IT'S SUCH A SHOCK
FOR ME TO IMAGINE ANY??
WHAT DOES THIS MATTER WITH
ANYTHING? LET'S BRING THIS HOME.
(Robert) I'VE LEARNED IN LIFE,
WHEN SOMETHING'S TOO HARD,
IT'S PROBABLY GOOD TO GET OUT.
SO, UH,
YOU SEEM TO HAVE
A DIFFICULT TIME
WITH GIVING ME
A STRAIGHT ANSWER, SO I'M OUT.
WHAT WAS YOUR...
LET'S JUST MOVE ON.
JAMES, YOU HAVE TWO DEALS
ON THE TABLE HERE.
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?
SO I SHOULD MAKE
A PHONE CALL.
JAMES, WHO ARE YOU GONNA CALL?
MY WIFE.
JAMES...
THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE OFFER.
I'M GONNA COME IN HALF
WITH KEVIN.
THERE'S ONLY ONE OPPORTUNITY.
WE'RE BUYING YOUR COMPANY
FOR $150,000.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR FORMULA
AND LICENSE IT
AND PAY YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
7% OF EVERY CENT WE MAKE.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU.
BUT WITH CERTAINTY
SO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS,
WE'LL BE FIRING YOU THE MINUTE
WE GIVE YOU THE $150,000.
WE WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME,
A LOT OF ENERGY,
AND WE WILL CALL
EVERYBODY THAT WE KNOW??
WHICH IS FIVE PEOPLE
THAT CONTROL THE ENTIRE PLANET.
I'M BUSY.
LOOK, LET'S GET
VERY FOCUSED HERE.
YOU CAN'T GET $150,000
FROM A BANK.
THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN
GET SOME CASH RIGHT NOW
IS RIGHT HERE, THIS MOMENT.
ARE YOU IN OR ARE YOU OUT?
SO NO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES?
YES OR NO?
I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT OFFER.
I'LL ADD ANOTHER $75,000 TO IT
IF THE GUYS LET ME IN.
$225,000 FOR THE 100%
AND YOU GET A 7% ROYALTY.
SAME CONDITION.
I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT AMOUNT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
(exhales deeply)
I THOUGHT MORE MONEY
WOULD SWAY HIM.
UNBELIEVABLE.
I WAS INCREDIBLY INSULTED
WHEN THEY THOUGHT
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS ME.
THEY'RE MAKING
ALL THESE ASSUMPTIONS,
AND THEY WEREN'T THERE.
SO IT??IT??IT WAS... AWFUL.
