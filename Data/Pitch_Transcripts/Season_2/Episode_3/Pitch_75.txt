HI, I'M JAMES MITCHELL.
MY COMPANY IS
PURE AYRE ODOR ELIMINATOR.
I'M SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY.
NOW PURE AYRE IS
ALL RIGHT, JAMES, IT'S SHOWTIME
NOW. DO YOU OWN THIS PATENT?
IT IS NOT PATENTED.
OH.
WHY ISN'T IT PATENTED?
SORRY. SORRY, JAMES.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUR SALES
FOR <i>THIS</i> YEAR WERE $3.2 MILLION.
NO, SINCE INCEPTION.
OH. WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?
LAST YEAR WAS $315,000 SOLD??
WHAT WERE THEY THE YEAR BEFORE
THEY WERE $300,000?
THAT'S KIND OF AN EXCITING,
UM... MOMENT TO DISCUSS
BECAUSE THE YEAR BEFORE THAT,
THEY WERE OVER HALF A MILLION.
JAMES, DO YOU OWN 100%
OF THIS BUSINESS?
JAMES, IS THIS THE ONLY PRODUCT
IN THE WORLD
THAT IS ALL?NATURAL
THAT DOES THIS?
THIS IS THE ONLY FOOD?GRADE
ODOR ELIMINATOR TECHNOLOGY.
IS THERE ANOTHER PRODUCT
THAT <i>ISN'T</i> FOOD?GRADE
THAT I <i>CAN'T</i> SPRAY
INTO BARBARA'S MOUTH
BUT WILL STILL DO THE SAME JOB?
UM, I KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THAT COME TO US
HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH...
THERE ARE COMPETITORS.
THERE ARE COMPETITORS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ARE YOU READY TO LICENSE THIS
TO SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY
CAN GET DISTRIBUTION?
HOW ARE WE GLOSSING OVER
THIS FACT?
THEY RAISED $600,000.
THEY HIRED A PROFESSIONAL C. E. O.
I'M SURE THAT GUY DID THAT.
WELL, JAMES,
SO YOU HIRED A BOZO
WHO BLEW $600,000.
JAMES, TELL ME "YES" OR "NO."
JAMES,
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING US.
WE JUST WANT "YES" OR "NO."
ANY ANYBODY IN YOUR COMPANY
OR AFFILIATED WITH YOUR COMPANY
TALKED TO A MAJOR PRODUCER
OF THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT?
(Robert) IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.
UM, MY FORMER C. E. O...
YES OR NO? YES OR NO?
UH...
TALKED TO A DIVISION...
JAMES, YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
$600,000 OF INVESTORS' MONEY.
NOW YOU WANT $150,000.
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I'M OUT.
JAMES... HERE'S MY DEAL.
I THINK THE ONLY THING
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN EDUCATION
IS IGNORANCE,
IT MAKES THEM THINK
THAT YOU'RE SHIFTY.
JAMES, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT
'CAUSE YOU'RE FIRED
THE SECOND I BUY THE COMPANY.
WELL, I <i>DO</i> CARE ABOUT THAT
'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
IS HE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW
HE'S <i>REALLY</i> BAD AT HIS JOB...
WHO CARES?
SO I CAN MAKE AN OFFER?
OKAY, SO HOW CAN I
BE BAD AT MY JOB
WHEN I BUILT THIS MARKET
FROM SCRATCH IN THE NORTHWEST??
JAMES, YES OR NO? BECAUSE IT IS
ABOUT TO BE RETRACTED.
DAYMOND, WE HEARD YOUR OFFER.
WE HEARD KEVIN'S OFFER.
LET??LET ME JUST ASK A QUESTION
BEFORE I DECIDE
WHETHER I'M GONNA
MAKE AN OFFER OR NOT.
ARE YOU WILLING TO WALK AWAY?
JAMES, IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TODAY
CONTINGENT ON YOU BEING
AN EMPLOYEE IN THAT BUSINESS?
CONSUMERS OUT THERE
WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH,
JAMES, YOU HAVE TWO DEALS
ON THE TABLE HERE.
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?
SO I SHOULD MAKE
A PHONE CALL.
JAMES, WHO ARE YOU GONNA CALL?
MY WIFE.
JAMES...
THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE OFFER.
I'M GONNA COME IN HALF
WITH KEVIN.
THERE'S ONLY ONE OPPORTUNITY.
WE'RE BUYING YOUR COMPANY
FOR $150,000.
