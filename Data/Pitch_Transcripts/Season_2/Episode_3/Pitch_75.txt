MY NAME IS STACY ERWIN.
MY PRODUCT IS CALLED
FITNESS STRIDE.
I'M LOOKING FOR $140,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 15% EQUITY IN MY BUSINESS.
NOW WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU
IS SO GOOD
THAT I'M?A SERVE IT TO YOU
ON A SILVER PLATTER.
NUMBER ONE, THIS IS THE SOLUTION
TO OBESITY ISSUE IN CHILDREN.
NUMBER TWO, IT SOLVES
LOWER BACK PAINS, BAD KNEES,
AND TIGHTEN YOUR ABS.
AND NUMBER THREE,
IT TONE, SHAPE, AND FIRM
HIP, BUTT, AND THIGHS IN WOMEN.
AND NUMBER FOUR,
IT MAKES ATHLETES RUN
FASTER, QUICKER, LONGER,
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING EXTRA.
EVERY GET?IN?SHAPE PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT ON THE MARKET
REQUIRES THIS THING CALLED TIME,
BUT THE FITNESS STRIDE
ALLOWS YOU TO GET IN SHAPE
WHILE YOU'RE MULTITASKING.
NOW WALK WITH ME FOR A MINUTE.
I'M?A GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
HOW THIS WORKS.
I WANT YOU TO MENTALLY COUNT
HOW MANY TIMES
MEAGAN RAISES HER KNEE.
NOW COUNT HOW MANY TIMES
ZEENA RAISES HER KNEE.
ACTUALLY, ZEENA RAISED
HER KNEE FOUR TIMES...
BECAUSE SHE HAS ON RESISTANCE.
IT'S LIKE THIS.
IF I WAS TO CURL MY EMPTY HAND
TWO TIMES WITH NOTHING IN IT,
THAT'S NOT AS GOOD AS CURLING IT
ONE TIME WITH A 25?POUND WEIGHT.
THIS IS SO GOOD,
YOU CAN SIT DOWN AT YOUR DESK,
NOT DO ANYTHING,
AND BURN MORE CALORIES
THAN BEING ON A TREADMILL
FOR 45 MINUTES.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
(Robert) HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
TRUST ME,
I'M?A SHOW YOU!
OKAY!
HOLD THAT, GRAB THAT,
PULL THAT APART A COUPLE TIMES.
BARBARA, I GOT SOMETHING
SPECIAL FOR YOU, BABY GIRL.
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT IT.
(Robert) OOH!
I'M FEELING THE MAGIC
THERE, BARBARA.
(laughs)
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THIS WORKS.
JUST A SEC. HOLD TIGHT.
I HOPE MY WIFE
NEVER SEES THIS PART.
OPEN YOUR KNEES, HOLD.
OPEN, HOLD. DON'T MOVE.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME I'M BURNING
CALORIES JUST MOVING MY KNEES??
NO. I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MOVE ONE MUSCLE.
OH, REALLY. OH, THAT'S HARD
TO DO. IT'S STARTING TO HURT.
HEY, "BEAST,"
THIS IS KILLING ME.
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU YOU COULD
GET A WORKOUT BY NOT MOVING?
NOW WHERE YOU FEEL IT AT?
YEAH, IT'S STARTING TO BURN.
CAN YOU WALK WITH THIS?
WALK, RUN, JOG...
COME HERE.
NOW DO ME A FAVOR.
COME HERE.
(laughs)
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IT DOESN'T LOOK THAT COOL!
NO, IT DOES NOT.
(sharks laughing)
(O'Leary) WOW.
(Robert) STACY.
YES.
I DON'T KNOW IF I GET IT.
SO I RUN A LOT...
OKAY.
RUN 2 MILES WITH IT ON.
YOU'LL GET THE SAME BENEFIT
JUST LIKE YOU RAN 4 OR 5 MILES.
YOU COULDN'T RUN WITH THIS.
IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME
RUNNING WITH IT, IT'S BECAUSE
YOUR CONNECTING TISSUES
ARE WEAKER THAN YOU THINK.
IF YOU RAN A MILE IN WAIST?DEEP
WATER, YOU'D BURN THE SAME
AMOUNT OF ENERGY RUNNING
4 OR 5 MILES ON DRY LAND.
OKAY, SO, BEAST,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
WHAT DO YOU SELL THESE FOR?
WHAT DO THEY COST YOU TO MAKE?
WHAT'S YOUR MARKETING PLAN?
$49.95, YOU GET 2 SETS
OF COLOR?CODED POWER BANDS,
GIVE YOU 36 DIFFERENT
RESISTANCE COMBINATIONS.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT?
$10 IN CHINA. FOOT LOCKER
BUYS IT WHOLESALE FOR $30.
AND YOU'RE IN FOOT LOCKER?
FOOT LOCKER, LADY FOOT LOCKER,
EASTBAY, CHAMPS, WEB SITES.
HAS THE BUSINESS BEEN
GROWING OVER THE YEARS,
OR IT'S JUST BEEN
STAYING STEADY?
HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT
I'M HAVING WITH THIS PRODUCT.
WHO KNOWS IT'S
<i>IN</i> FOOT LOCKER?
WHO KNOWS IT'S
<i>AT</i> LADY FOOT LOCKER?
YOU CAN HAVE THE GREATEST
PRODUCT IN THE WORLD.
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT??
EXACTLY, STACY. WHICH IS
THE PROBLEM WHY YOU'RE HERE.
EXACTLY.
STACY, WHAT WERE
YOUR SALES LAST YEAR?
$150,000.
AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE
ON THE $150,000?
ABOUT $60,000.
SO YOU'RE VALUATING
YOUR COMPANY AT $900,000.
I DIDN'T VALUATE
MY COMPANY AT $900,000.
DID YOU ASK FOR 15%
FOR $140,000?
YES.
THAT'S MATH.
YEAH.
OKAY. $900,000, OKAY.
WHY? WHY, UH...
WELL... THERE'S??THERE'S...
VALUE IN THE PATENT.
YOU'RE VALUING THE PATENT
AT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS?
ABOUT $400,000.
SO, STACY, FOR YOUR COMPANY
TO BE WORTH THAT KIND OF MONEY,
YOU GOT TO SELL A LOT.
SO TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GONNA GO
FROM $150,000 IN SALES
TO MILLIONS.
INFOMERCIAL.
STACY, LET'S ASK THE INFOMERCIAL
KING. INFOMERCIAL KING?
YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM I HAVE...
YOU MADE A LOT OF PROMISES HERE.
YOU S??YOU TALK ABOUT
ABS, BACK, THIGHS...
MM?HMM...
MM?HMM... MM?HMM.
YOU KNOW??
AND PEACE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
YOU KNOW, I ONLY GOT
A BURN IN THE LEGS HERE.
I DIDN'T??I DON'T SEE IT
AS A TOTAL BODY??
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
WHEN YOU WALK OR RUN, WHAT PART
OF YOUR BODY DOES THAT AFFECT?
YOUR ENTIRE BODY. 'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT GONNA TAKE OFF YOUR ARM
AND LEAVE IT OVER
IN THE CORNER.
(laughs)
I LOVE THAT.
SO DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, ANY
"BEFORE" AND "AFTER" PICTURES
OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED THIS
AND HAVE HAD ANY KIND
OF MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION?
YES, I HAVE. YES, I DO.
I HELPED A LADY
LOSE 150 POUNDS.
SHE WORE IT UNDERNEATH HER
DRESS. NOBODY KNEW IT WAS THERE.
ONE LADY?
I CANNOT SEE KEVIN O'LEARY,
WHO DOESN'T EVEN GO TO THE GYM,
GOING HOME, BUYING THESE BANDS,
STRAPPING THEM ON...
I JUST CAN'T SEE
PEOPLE BUYING IT.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS IN SQUASH
ANY TIME YOU WANT.
HERE'S THE ISSUE??
IT'S A MARKETING NIGHTMARE.
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I HAVE NO IDEA
IF <i>THIS</i> WORKS OR NOT,
BUT YOU NEED TO SPEND HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO GET OUT THERE.
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT, STACY.
OKAY.
THIS YEAR, I'VE LOOKED
AT ABOUT 100 FITNESS PRODUCTS.
MOST OF THEM HAVE
SOME KIND OF REALLY BIG
TESTIMONIAL BASE...
RIGHT.
"BEFORE" AND "AFTERS"...
RIGHT.
AND I DON'T SEE THAT HERE
WITH THIS PRODUCT, SO I'M OUT.
YOU JUST REALLY VALUATED
THE COMPANY TOO MUCH.
THAT MAKES IT
TOO RICH OF A DEAL FOR ME,
SO I'D HAVE TO BE OUT.
WELL, STACY, I HAPPEN
TO LOVE YOUR HUSTLE.
AND YOUR TUSH.
(chuckles)
YEAH. I HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT'S LOOKING GOOD, TOO.
BUT I'M JUST NOT SOLD
ON YOUR PRODUCT,
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT...
(laughs)
AND I'M SOLD ON YOU, TOO.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I GOT
TO TRY AND MAKE SOME MONEY NOW.
PLEASE LEAVE.
(chuckles)
I WOULDN'T TALK TO A BIG GUY
LIKE THAT, LIKE THAT.
YEAH.
YEAH, I WOULDN'T
MESS WITH HIM.
