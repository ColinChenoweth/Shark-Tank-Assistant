I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO VINNY PASTORE,
STAR OF "SOPRANOS."
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A REDNECK
WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE STRAPPED
TO YOUR LUGGAGE.
(laughs)
HE MAKES NOISE. TYPICAL.
NOBODY WANTS
TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
MY DEALS ARE GOOD.
(laughs)
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THAT MUCH.
WORSE THING I'VE HEARD
ON THIS SHOW.
COME ON, HONEY.
HI, MY NAME IS JOHN GENNARO.
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY ASSOCIATE,
MR. VINNY PASTORE,
THE CELEBRITY STAR
OF HBO's SERIES, "SOPRANOS."
I CREATED A PRODUCT
CALLED THE BROCCOLI WAD.
(laughs)
I'M HERE TODAY LOOKING
FOR AN INVESTMENT OF $50,000,
JOHNNY, LET ME JUST START
BY SAYING,
IF HE'S PACKING HEAT...
(laughs)
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY
IS INVOLVED, I'M IN.
NOW MOST GUYS CARRY
THEIR MONEY IN A WALLET.
BUT WISE GUYS CARRY THEIR MONEY
IN A WAD LIKE THIS.
(Johnny) THE BROCCOLI WAD
CONCEPT CAME FROM AN IDEA
OF A BOOK I READ
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
VINNY, DON'T??DON'T BREAK
MY LEGS FOR ASKING THIS...
OKAY.
BUT??BUT COME ON,
IT??IT'S A PIECE OF RUBBER.
RIGHT.
THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WORTH
$250,000 AS A COMPANY?
WELL, UM,
HOW MUCH YOU GIVING ME
EVERY TIME WE SELL ONE?
YOU GET 50 CENTS A UNIT.
SO IF I GET 50 CENTS
A UNIT...
(sharks laugh)
2?MINUTE SPOTS, UH, ALREADY
WITH VINNY IN IT.
HE SHOT IT WITH SOME OF
MY "SOPRANO" CAST MEMBERS,
I WANT TO BE VINNY. YOU FIGURED
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.
NAH, NAH.
HE TOOK CARE OF ME.
HOW DOES HE TAKE CARE OF YOU?
HE TAKES CARE OF ME.
(sharks laugh)
I COME FROM A BACKGROUND
OF NOVELTY ITEMS.
I SEE THIS AS
AS SEEN ON TV, 2?MINUTE SPOT,
$9.99 PLUS SHIPPING??
SO??SO, JOHN,
DO YOU NEED THE 50K
TO BUY THE AIRTIME
TO FINALLY PUT THIS COMMERCIAL
OUT THERE
WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT?
I NEED THE $50,000,
SOME OF THAT, YES,
TO HELP IN THE TV ITSELF,
BUT THE REALITY IS,
I'M LOOKING FOR
WHY DON'T I SEE
VINNY'S PICTURE ANYWHERE?
WHY ISN'T IT CALLED
THE VINNY WAD?
LIKE WHY ISN'T HE??
IF YOU CALLED IT
THE VINNY WAD??
WHY ISN'T HIS PICTURE ON HERE?
THE VINNY WAD'S
PROBABLY BETTER, SURE.
DO YOU SEE VINNY AS??
AS KIND OF THE FACE OF THIS?
YEAH, I'M BACK IN
FOR THE VINNY WAD.
YOU WANT TO DO
THE VINNY WAD?
YEAH.
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
YOUR GREATEST ASSET
IS STANDING NEXT TO YOU.
TO SPEAK HONESTLY
IN FRONT OF JOHNNY WAD,
THAT IT'S A MATTER
OF ECONOMICS.
HE'S NOT PAYING YOU ENOUGH.
HE'S NOT
PAYING YOU ENOUGH.
I THINK THAT SOUNDS
VERY EXPENSIVE. I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS JUST ISN'T FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
YEAH, I?I DON'T HAVE
AN OFFER. I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA MAKE A DEAL
FOR YOU.
VINNY, LISTEN TO THIS??
(Robert)
VINNY'S NOT A SHARK.
WAIT, WELL??
WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS DATING NOW?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA SAY??
40% FOR THE $50,000.
I DON'T NEED JOHNNY WAD.
JOHN, YOU JUST GOT WHACKED.
YOU DIDN'T GET WHACKED.
YOU'RE STILL INTO IT FOR 60%.
I GOT WHAT, 60%?
LET ME JUST SAY IT AGAIN.
I'M GIVING YOU THE $50,000.
OKAY, YEAH.
FOR THAT, I GET 40%.
OKAY.
I'M GONNA GIVE 20%,
OR HALF OF MY 40%, TO VINNY.
JUST PUT VINNY'S PICTURE
ON IT.
YOU NEED A STICKER
WITH VINNY ON IT.
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED,
RIGHT UP HERE.
BUT HOW ARE WE
GONNA MOVE FORWARD?
I CAME HERE
NOT JUST FOR MONEY,
THE MINUTE I THOUGHT OF
THE VINNY CLIP,
I KNEW THIS WAS A HOME RUN.
(Robert)
THIS IS ONE TOUGH BROAD.
(Vinny) I LIKE HER.
STOP, JOHNNY. RELAX.
(Barbara)
WAIT A MINUTE. (laughs)
(sharks laugh)
DO YOU ACCEPT THE DEAL?
OKAY, WELL, WE
BOTH MADE THE DEAL.
WE BOTH MADE THE DEAL.
OKAY, GREAT. I'M HAPPY.
I THINK SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S WONDERFUL.
WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED.
RIGHT, VINNY'S??
VINNY'S WAD.
VINNY'S WAD. VINNY'S CLIP.
VINNY'S WHATEVER.
VINNY'S WAD.
THAT'S FINE.
VINNY'S WAD IT IS.
AS LONG AS I SELL
FOUR MILLION.
(laughs) OKAY.
