I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO VINNY PASTORE,
STAR OF "SOPRANOS."
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A REDNECK
WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE STRAPPED
TO YOUR LUGGAGE.
(laughs)
HE MAKES NOISE. TYPICAL.
NOBODY WANTS
TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
MY DEALS ARE GOOD.
(laughs)
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THAT MUCH.
WORSE THING I'VE HEARD
ON THIS SHOW.
COME ON, HONEY.
HI, MY NAME IS JOHN GENNARO.
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY ASSOCIATE,
MR. VINNY PASTORE,
THE CELEBRITY STAR
OF HBO's SERIES, "SOPRANOS."
I CREATED A PRODUCT
CALLED THE BROCCOLI WAD.
(laughs)
I'M HERE TODAY LOOKING
FOR AN INVESTMENT OF $50,000,
AND FOR THAT, I'M WILLING
TO GIVE 20% OF THE COMPANY AWAY.
AS THEY SAY, IT'S AN OFFER,
HOPEFULLY, YOU CAN'T REFUSE.
JOHNNY, LET ME JUST START
BY SAYING,
IF HE'S PACKING HEAT...
(laughs)
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY
IS INVOLVED, I'M IN.
NOW MOST GUYS CARRY
THEIR MONEY IN A WALLET.
BUT WISE GUYS CARRY THEIR MONEY
IN A WAD LIKE THIS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS THE BROCCOLI WAD.
(Johnny) THE BROCCOLI WAD
CONCEPT CAME FROM AN IDEA
OF A BOOK I READ
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
AND IT WAS TALKING ABOUT
AN FBI AGENT
WHO INFILTRATED
THE MOB IN NEW YORK.
AND ONE OF
THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS
WAS THAT WISE GUYS
NEVER CARRY WALLETS.
THEY CARRY THEIR CASH
IN BROCCOLI BANDS,
NOT EVEN RUBBER BANDS.
THE BROCCOLI BAND
IS A PERFECT FIT
TO WRAP AROUND CASH
AND AROUND A??
WHERE DO WISE GUYS
KEEP THEIR CREDIT CARDS?
WISE GUYS
DON'T CARRY CREDIT CARDS.
JUST CASH?
YEAH, JUST CASH.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE I. D.'d
IF THEY STOP YOU.
OF COURSE.
THEY DO CARRY A LICENSE,
BUT NORMALLY,
IT'S FROM OUT OF STATE
AND IT'S EXPIRED.
(laughs)
HAVE YOU GOT SOME THERE
THAT WE CAN SEE AS YOU??
ACTUALLY, I HAVE ONE
FOR EVERYBODY.
NOW I MET JOHNNY,
AND HE SAYS,
I CREATED THIS PRODUCT,
THE BROCCOLI WAD.
SO I THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW, OFF HIS ROCKER.
BUT WHAT I WAS IMPRESSED ABOUT
WITH THIS BROCCOLI WAD
WAS, I MEAN,
LOOK HOW CUTE IT IS. (laughs)
(laughs)
VINNY, DON'T??DON'T BREAK
MY LEGS FOR ASKING THIS...
OKAY.
BUT??BUT COME ON,
IT??IT'S A PIECE OF RUBBER.
RIGHT.
THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WORTH
$250,000 AS A COMPANY?
WELL, UM,
HOW MUCH YOU GIVING ME
EVERY TIME WE SELL ONE?
YOU GET 50 CENTS A UNIT.
SO IF I GET 50 CENTS
A UNIT...
(sharks laugh)
AND IF HE SELLS ENOUGH OF 'EM,
I'LL GET MY HOUSE IN MALIBU.
YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU'RE BOTH TOTALLY NUTS.
I DON'T GET IT.
I AM SO OUT ON THIS.
WORSE THING
I'VE HEARD ON THIS SHOW.
BARBARA, I WOULDN'T
TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S
ALL RIGHT. SHE'S A SWEETHEART.
BARBARA, I THINK
IN FAIRNESS TO THE PRODUCT,
IT'S A DIFFICULT FEMALE ITEM.
GUYS GET IT 'CAUSE GUYS
HAVE ALWAYS USED RUBBER BANDS.
AND I WILL SAY THIS, AS A GUY, I
MEAN, I'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT,
I??MY WALLET GOT WHERE IT WAS
THE SIZE OF A PHONE BOOK,
SO I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING TO PUT MY CASH IN.
RIGHT.
AND MOST OF THE CLIPS
DON'T WORK RIGHT.
I MEAN, I'M??
I LIKE THIS IDEA.
JUST EXPLAIN
HOW WE'RE GONNA SELL THESE.
FIRST OF ALL,
THE PRODUCT COMES
WITH FOUR BANDS
AND FOUR METAL SLIDES.
THIS IS GONNA BE
A $10 TO $14 ITEM.
I'VE ALREADY CREATED TWO
2?MINUTE SPOTS, UH, ALREADY
WITH VINNY IN IT.
HE SHOT IT WITH SOME OF
MY "SOPRANO" CAST MEMBERS,
AND WE'RE, UH, ABOUT TO DO
THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN.
WE ALREADY TALKED, UH,
TO THE CASINOS IN ATLANTIC CITY
AND VEGAS, WHERE I WILL BE
DOING PERSONAL APPEARANCES,
AND THE CASINO WILL BE GIVING
THEM OUT TO CASINO PLAYERS.
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE INVESTED
IN THIS COMPANY?
I ALREADY HAVE
ABOUT $200,000 INTO IT.
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?
(Robert) WOW.
'CAUSE HE PAID ME $190,000.
(sharks laugh)
I WANT TO BE VINNY. YOU FIGURED
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.
NAH, NAH.
HE TOOK CARE OF ME.
HOW DOES HE TAKE CARE OF YOU?
HE TAKES CARE OF ME.
(sharks laugh)
I COME FROM A BACKGROUND
OF NOVELTY ITEMS.
I SEE THIS AS
AS SEEN ON TV, 2?MINUTE SPOT,
$9.99 PLUS SHIPPING??
SO??SO, JOHN,
DO YOU NEED THE 50K
TO BUY THE AIRTIME
TO FINALLY PUT THIS COMMERCIAL
OUT THERE
WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT?
I NEED THE $50,000,
SOME OF THAT, YES,
TO HELP IN THE TV ITSELF,
BUT THE REALITY IS,
I'M LOOKING FOR
THE SALES
AND MARKETING EXPERTISE.
WHY DON'T I SEE
VINNY'S PICTURE ANYWHERE?
WHY ISN'T IT CALLED
THE VINNY WAD?
LIKE WHY ISN'T HE??
IF YOU CALLED IT
THE VINNY WAD??
WHY ISN'T HIS PICTURE ON HERE?
THE VINNY WAD'S
PROBABLY BETTER, SURE.
DO YOU SEE VINNY AS??
AS KIND OF THE FACE OF THIS?
(John) WITHOUT VINNY, THIS IS??
THIS IS A RUBBER BAND.
YEAH, I'M BACK IN
FOR THE VINNY WAD.
YOU WANT TO DO
THE VINNY WAD?
YEAH.
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
YOUR GREATEST ASSET
IS STANDING NEXT TO YOU.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
BRANDED HIM ANYWHERE.
IS HE WITH THIS LONG?TERM?
COULD BE.
UH, I THINK,
THEN TRUTHFULLY,
TO SPEAK HONESTLY
IN FRONT OF JOHNNY WAD,
THAT IT'S A MATTER
OF ECONOMICS.
HE'S NOT PAYING YOU ENOUGH.
HE'S NOT
PAYING YOU ENOUGH.
I THINK THAT SOUNDS
VERY EXPENSIVE. I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS JUST ISN'T FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
YEAH, I?I DON'T HAVE
AN OFFER. I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA MAKE A DEAL
FOR YOU.
VINNY, LISTEN TO THIS??
WE'RE GONNA MAKE AN OFFER,
VINNY AND I...
(Robert)
VINNY'S NOT A SHARK.
WAIT, WELL??
WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS DATING NOW?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA SAY??
40% FOR THE $50,000.
YOU PUT UP THE FACE
AND THE VINNY WAD NAME,
AND VINNY GETS HALF OF MY 40%.
WELL, I'M OUT.
THAT'S A GREAT OFFER.
THAT'S A DEAL, BARBARA.
THANK YOU.
BABY, HONEY.
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.
GIVE ME A SQUEEZE.
OH. (speaks Italian)
WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?
(Daymond) WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
WHERE DO I GO?
BARBARA BOUGHT ME OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
(sharks laugh)
I DON'T NEED JOHNNY WAD.
JOHN, YOU JUST GOT WHACKED.
YOU DIDN'T GET WHACKED.
YOU'RE STILL INTO IT FOR 60%.
I GOT WHAT, 60%?
LET ME JUST SAY IT AGAIN.
I'M GIVING YOU THE $50,000.
OKAY, YEAH.
FOR THAT, I GET 40%.
OKAY.
I'M GONNA GIVE 20%,
OR HALF OF MY 40%, TO VINNY.
OKAY.
AND VINNY'S GONNA DONATE
HIS FACE
AND HIS BRAND TO YOUR PRODUCT.
SO BASICALLY, SHE FUNDED
GETTING HIM INTO THE DEAL
WITH HIS FACE, AND HE AGREED.
HE NOW HAS 20% OF THE COMPANY.
SHE HAS 20% OF THE COMPANY.
YOU'VE GOT $50,000.
AND YOU STILL
RUN THE BUSINESS.
HOW MUCH PRODUCT DO YOU HAVE
IN YOUR WAREHOUSE?
50,000 PIECES.
CAN I SEE THE PACKAGE?
JUST PUT VINNY'S PICTURE
ON IT.
YOU NEED A STICKER
WITH VINNY ON IT.
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED,
RIGHT UP HERE.
BUT HOW ARE WE
GONNA MOVE FORWARD?
I CAME HERE
NOT JUST FOR MONEY,
BUT FOR SALES
AND MARKETING EXPERTISE.
DO I GET YOUR EXPERTISE?
THE ONLY THING I KNOW
REALLY, REALLY WELL
IS SALES AND MARKETING.
THE MINUTE I THOUGHT OF
THE VINNY CLIP,
I KNEW THIS WAS A HOME RUN.
(Robert)
THIS IS ONE TOUGH BROAD.
(Vinny) I LIKE HER.
BARBARA'S MY STYLE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE MY STYLE, TOO.
BARBARA, WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO DO, WE'RE GONNA ROLL.
WHOA. YOU GUYS GO AHEAD
AND TAKE IT.
NO, WE'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY.
STOP, JOHNNY. RELAX.
(Barbara)
WAIT A MINUTE. (laughs)
(sharks laugh)
DO YOU ACCEPT THE DEAL?
I'LL ACCEPT IT.
(Barbara and Robert) ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS??THIS IS
HISTORY IN THE MAKING.
I GOT TWO MEN FOR THE PRICE
OF ONE. THANK YOU.
AND I WANT TO HUG
MY PARTNER. THANKS, GUYS.
YOU MADE A GREAT DEAL.
WAS IT A BLUFF, OR YOU SAID,
"THIS IS THE WORST IDEA
I'VE EVER HEARD
ON 'SHARK TANK,'"
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE HUGGING AND KISSING?
NO, I MEANT IT WAS
THE WORST IDEA.
IT STILL IS,
BUT ONCE YOU MARKET IT,
IT'S GENIUS.
I'M REALLY GLAD I MADE
THE DEAL WITH BARBARA. SH??
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE DEAL
WITH BARBARA.
OKAY, WELL, WE
BOTH MADE THE DEAL.
WE BOTH MADE THE DEAL.
OKAY, GREAT. I'M HAPPY.
I THINK SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S WONDERFUL.
I THINK SHE'LL BE GREAT
FOR SALES AND MARKETING,
WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED.
RIGHT, VINNY'S??
VINNY'S WAD.
VINNY'S WAD. VINNY'S CLIP.
VINNY'S WHATEVER.
VINNY'S WAD.
THAT'S FINE.
VINNY'S WAD IT IS.
AS LONG AS I SELL
FOUR MILLION.
(laughs) OKAY.
