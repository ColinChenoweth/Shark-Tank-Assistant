MY NAME IS MIKE.
HI, MY NAME'S SHON LEES. THIS IS
MY PARTNER MIKE ABBATICCHIO.
ON THAT TRIP, MIKE SHOWED ME
THE HillBilly LOGO HE CREATED,
(Robert) MIKE,
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE WITH IT.
HOW WOULD YOU EVER
GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE?
NOT REALLY. THEY DON'T
PAY THEMSELVES ANYTHING.
SO, SHON, THE??THE $50,000
YOU'RE ASKING FOR,
WHAT??WHAT WOULD YOU USE
THAT FOR?
WELL, WE WANNA START ATTENDING
THE TRADE SHOWS
TO GET IT
IN FRONT OF THE BUYERS
(Shon) WE'RE ALL FOR THAT.
WE'RE NOT AGAINST LICENSING.
WHEN WE GO TO THESE EVENTS,
'CAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE
THOSE CONTACTS.
SHON, I THINK
THE ULTIMATE REDNECK?
IS THAT DISRESPECTFUL, JEFF?
NO, I??THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
OKAY, THE ULTIMATE
REDNECK/HILLBILLY
IS SITTING RIGHT THERE
AT THE END.
JEFF, WOULD YOU LICENSE THIS?
IF YOU CAN GET JEFF TO COME IN
ON THE DEAL, I'LL MAKE AN OFFER.
BUT I WANT 100% OF THE NAME.
I JUST WANT TO BUY THE NAME
(Shon) YOU LIKE THAT, HUH, JEFF?
(Daymond) I'M ALREADY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU GUYS.
(Robert) COME ON, JEFF.
PUT YOUR HAT ON, GUYS. YEAH!
(Mike) I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE THAT. LOOKS GOOD, MAN.
(Daymond) ALL RIGHT, MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.
HEY, JEFF, THANKS.
(Jeff) THANKS, MAN.
IT COULD WORK.
(sighs)
DO OR DIE, MAN. WHEW!
IT MEANS A LOT TO HAVE A DEAL
WITH FOXWORTHY.
I MEAN, THAT GUY <i>IS</i> COUNTRY,
YOU KNOW.
