MY NAME IS MIKE.
MY NAME'S SHON.
WE'RE FROM PARKLAND, FLORIDA.
WE'RE THE FOUNDERS OF THE NEXT
GREAT AMERICAN CLOTHING COMPANY,
HillBilly BRAND.
THE TERM "HILLBILLY" IS NOT
WHAT IT USED TO BE.
IT REPRESENTS THE COUNTRY
LIFESTYLE, OUTDOOR LIVING.
PLEASE ARE PROUD TO WEAR IT.
IT'S A BADGE OF HONOR.
OUR WIVES THOUGHT
WE WERE CRAZY
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED
THIS COMPANY.
BUT AFTER SELLING OUT
AT OUR FIRST EVENT,
THEY STARTED TO COME AROUND.
WELL, THEY STILL THINK
WE'RE CRAZY,
BUT NOW THEY'RE TRUE BELIEVERS.
RIGHT NOW, THE MAJORITY
OF OUR SALES
ARE COMING FROM EVENTS LIKE
RODEOS, MUD FESTS, CONCERTS.
(cheering)
WHEN PEOPLE PASS BY OUR TENT
TO SEE OUR BRAND
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME REACTION.
THEY'RE SMILING,
THEY'RE MOUTHS ARE OPEN,
THEY'RE POSING FOR PICTURES
IN FRONT OF OUR SIGN.
I MEAN, PEOPLE JUST LOVE
THE BRAND.
WHEN WE SET UP AT AN EVENT,
WE BRING THE PARTY.
WE HAVE THE COUNTRY MUSIC
CRANKIN',
WE'VE GOT
THE HillBilly HOTTIES THERE.
WE'VE GOT THE CROWD
AT THE BOOTH,
AND EVERYBODY'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME.
AND WE'RE BRINGING THAT
SAME PARTY TO THE SHARK TANK.
YEAH, I WANT THE CAMO.
THANK YOU.
(Robert) CAN I HAVE
A COWBOY HAT?
(Daymond) THANK YOU.
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.
(laughs)
HI, MY NAME'S SHON LEES. THIS IS
MY PARTNER MIKE ABBATICCHIO.
AND WE'RE CO?OWNERS
OF HillBilly BRAND,
A COUNTRY LIFESTYLE
CLOTHING COMPANY.
WE ARE HERE TO ASK
FOR A $50,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 25% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
MIKE AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER
SINCE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WE WERE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR
A BUSINESS TO START,
BUT WE NEVER REALLY FOUND ONE WE
ENJOYED DOING IN OUR SPARE TIME.
THAT ALL CHANGED ON A SKI TRIP
TO COLORADO.
ON THAT TRIP, MIKE SHOWED ME
THE HillBilly LOGO HE CREATED,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
WE WENT TO OUR FIRST EVENT,
A SMALL LOCAL RODEO,
AND WE SOLD EVERYTHING
WE BROUGHT IN FOUR HOURS.
WE KNEW WE WERE
ONTO SOMETHING BIG.
NOW THE TERM "HILLBILLY"
IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE.
PEOPLE LOVE THE BRAND.
THEY WEAR IT PROUD.
IT REPRESENTS THEIR LIFESTYLE??
THE COUNTRY LIFESTYLE.
I WANT YOU TO THINK OUTDOORS??
HUNTING, FISHING, SKIING,
AND MORE. AND COUNTRY MUSIC
AND NASCAR FANS ARE AMONG
THE MOST LOYAL CONSUMERS.
AND THERE'S MILLIONS OF 'EM,
SO THIS IS JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
T?SHIRTS, HATS, AND TANK TOPS
ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING.
OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ASKING US
FOR BLUE JEANS, BATHING SUITS,
FISHING GEAR, HUNTING GEAR,
AND BACKPACKS.
WE CAN PUT THIS LOGO
ON JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.
I'M TELLING YOU GUYS,
THE PRODUCT AND LICENSING
OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENDLESS.
WITH THE RIGHT MANUFACTURING,
DISTRIBUTION, AND MARKETING,
HillBilly BRAND WILL BE
A HOUSEHOLD NAME.
EVERYBODY'S GOT A LITTLE
HILLBILLY IN 'EM. FIND YOURS.
FIND YOURS. AND, JEFF,
YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK,
BUT WE KNOW YOU GOT
A LITTLE HILLBILLY IN YOU.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
A HILLBILLY AND A REDNECK?
I'VE ALWAYS DEFINED REDNECK
AS A GLORIOUS ABSENCE
OF SOPHISTICATION.
(sharks laugh)
AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAD.
RIGHT.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I'VE KNOWN RICH GUYS
THAT CAME HOME
AND POPPED A BEER
AND SAT OUT ON THE PORCH
AND WATCHED THE BUG ZAPPER.
(laughs)
I MEAN,
THAT'S QUALITY ENTERTAINMENT.
I?I MEAN, I THINK
IT'S THE SAME ATTITUDE.
IT'S A FUN, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT
TOO MANY THINGS" KINDA ATTITUDE.
AND??AND I LIKED YOUR STUFF.
GUYS, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
YES. (chuckles)
YES. SO FAR,
WE'VE SOLD ABOUT $271,000
IN A LITTLE OVER
3 AND A HALF YEARS.
NEVER ANSWER A SALES QUESTION
WITH WHAT YOU'VE SOLD
OVER THREE YEARS.
YEP.
THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME THINK
YOUR SALES AREN'T VERY GOOD.
WHAT'D YOU SELL
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
SO FAR,
ABOUT $50,000 THIS YEAR,
WE'RE ON TRACK TO DO
$60,000.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DISTRIBUTION?
WHERE'S THIS STUFF SOLD?
UH, WE DO EVENT SALES.
WE DO ABOUT 12 A YEAR.
ONE A MONTH.
YOU HAVE NO RETAIL DISTRIBUTION.
WELL, WE JUST ACTUALLY SIGNED
A VENDOR AGREEMENT
WITH SPORTS AUTHORITY, AND WE'RE
GONNA START IN APPROXIMATELY
30 STORES IN THE SOUTHEAST.
AND WE GOT PICKED UP
BY A DISTRIBUTION
COMPANY CALLED BARJAN,
WHICH DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS
TO ALL THE TRAVEL PLAZAS
AND TRUCK STOPS
ACROSS THE NATION.
SO YOU OWN THE NAME HillBilly?
YES. WE ACT??WE OWN??
IN WHAT CATEGORIES?
WE OWN??WE OWN THE BRAND
AS FAR AS THE DESIGN LOGO
AND WE OWN JUST THE WORD
"HillBilly" FOR APPAREL??
BELTS, T?SHIRTS, HATS.
AND WE HAVE THREE TRADEMARKS
IN THE U. S. AND ONE IN CANADA.
(Robert) MIKE,
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE WITH IT.
HOW WOULD YOU EVER
GET YOUR NAME OUT THERE?
LIKE, THE ADVERTISING COSTS
TO BUILD A BRAND,
IF YOU'RE NOT A BRAND ALREADY,
WOULD COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $50,000.
WELL, HERE'S??HERE'S WHAT
WE'VE DONE SO FAR.
WE'VE CLOSELY ALIGNED OURSELVES
WITH COUNTRY MUSIC.
YOU KNOW, WE GO OUT
TO THE CONCERTS,
WE SET UP OUR TENT,
AND MOST OF THE TIME,
WE SELL MORE T?SHIRTS
THAN THE ARTISTS DO.
SO IN A TYPICAL EVENT, HOW MANY
T?SHIRTS WOULD YOU SELL?
IT'S IT'S A BIG CONCERT, UM,
IF IT'S 20,000 PEOPLE,
WE CAN SELL AS MUCH AS $10,000.
BUT THAT??THAT'S NOT
A NET NUMBER
BECAUSE I?I MEAN, I SELL
T?SHIRTS AT CONCERTS...
YES.
AND I KNOW THAT THE VENUES
BEAT YOU OVER THE HEAD.
I MEAN, THERE'S KIND OF A LOW
MARGIN ON THAT, ISN'T THERE?
WELL, IT DEPENDS. I MEAN,
IF IT'S??SOME??SOME EVENTS,
IT'S $100 TO GET IN.
SOME, IT'S $1,000.
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE A PROFIT
ON THAT?
YEAH, WELL,
WE'RE CASH FLOW?POSITIVE,
ABOUT IT OVER $7,000
FOR THE YEAR.
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING EVERYTHING
BACK INTO THE BUSINESS.
BUT YOU DON'T
PAY YOURSELVES ANYTHING.
NO, NOT YET.
SO YOUR BUSINESS MAKES
ABOUT $7,000.
NOT REALLY. THEY DON'T
PAY THEMSELVES ANYTHING.
SO, SHON, THE??THE $50,000
YOU'RE ASKING FOR,
WHAT??WHAT WOULD YOU USE
THAT FOR?
WELL, WE WANNA START ATTENDING
THE TRADE SHOWS
TO GET IT
IN FRONT OF THE BUYERS
AND WE WANNA EXPAND OUR
TRADEMARKS INTO OUR COUNTRIES.
I MEAN, WE WANNA TAKE OUR PARTY
TO THE TRADE SHOW.
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE ONE TABLE
AND TWO GUYS SITTING BEHIND IT,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN
WE SELL THIS STUFF,
WE GOT THE MUSIC BLASTING,
WE THROW IMPROMPTU CONCERTS.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ARTISTS
COME INTO OUR TENT.
YOU KNOW,
SO IT IS A HUGE PARTY,
AND??AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT FOLLOWING.
NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR $50,000
FOR 25% OF THE BUSINESS.
THAT MEANS YOU'RE VALUATING
YOUR BUSINESS AT $200,000.
ON $7,000 IN PROFIT.
NO PROFIT. THERE'S NO PROFIT.
STOP SAYING THAT.
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
ON NO PROFIT.
WE BASED THAT
ON THE $60,000 IN SALES,
2 AND A HALF TIMES EARNINGS,
PLUS $50,000 VALUE ON
THE 4 TRADEMARKS WE'RE HOLDING.
I THINK YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND
THE POWER OF THE MARK.
THAT RIGHT THERE IS
A GREAT BUSINESS ITSELF.
SO YOU GONNA WRITE A CHECK?
ARE YOU SELLING SOMETHING?
THEN MIND YOUR BUSINESS.
WHY NOT LICENSE THIS OUT
TO SOMEBODY...
(O'Leary) EXACTLY.
AND LET THEM GO AFTER
THE BIG RETAILERS?
AND??AND YOU REAP
THE BENEFITS.
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
THAT WE WANTED TO EXPLORE.
I MEAN, WE'VE ALREADY SIGNED
A LICENSING DEAL
WITH A CANADIAN
RECORD COMPANY.
AND THEY'RE GONNA START
PACKAGING IT WITH THEIR MUSIC
AND THEIR ARTISTS, AND SELLING
IT IN A HUNDRED HMV STORES,
YOU KNOW, COMING UP
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.
(O'Leary) OKAY, HERE'S WHAT
I TAKE FROM THIS.
NOW YOU'VE COME OUT HERE
AND SAID,
"LOOK, WE'RE SMART ENOUGH
TO KNOW
"THAT THE ONLY THING OF VALUE
WE HAVE IS OUR MARK??
"OUR BRAND HillBilly.
"WE'RE SO SMART THAT WE'VE GOT
FOUR DEALS TO LICENSE THIS,
AND THERE'S A COST TO
SET THAT UP, AND IT'S $50,000."
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMETHING
I WOULD'VE WRITTEN A CHECK FOR.
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN COMPETING IN RETAIL??
A CATEGORY THAT'S SO CROWDED,
GROWN MEN WEEP.
LICENSING'S NOT OFF??
YOU KNOW, NOT OFF THE TABLE.
WE ALREADY DID LICENSING.
LOOK, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE
VISION. YOU CAN'T HAVE 15,
AND LET ME PART OF THE ONES
THAT DON'T WORK.
I ONLY WANNA BE PART
OF THE ONES WHERE I GET RICH.
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.
HillBilly??I GOT IT.
I THINK IT WORKS.
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST STARTING
ON THE RETAIL SIDE.
BUT I DON'T WANNA BE IN RETAIL.
THAT IS THE MOST BRUTAL BUSINESS
ON EARTH.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND THAT OUT.
I'M OUT.
(Shon) WE'RE ALL FOR THAT.
WE'RE NOT AGAINST LICENSING.
WHEN WE GO TO THESE EVENTS,
AND THERE'S TEN OTHER
T?SHIRT VENDORS
AND THEN THERE'S THE SINGER'S
TENT, WE OUTSELL ALL OF THEM.
AND THEY COME TO US SAYING,
"WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
HOW??HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?"
WELL, LET ME JUST SAY TO YOU,
I WISH I HAD THE LICENSING
CONTACTS TO HELP YOU OUT.
I THINK THAT IS
THE WAY TO GO, FOR SURE,
WITH SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST.
SO I'M OUT
'CAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE
THOSE CONTACTS.
SHON, I THINK
THE ULTIMATE REDNECK?
IS THAT DISRESPECTFUL, JEFF?
NO, I??THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
OKAY, THE ULTIMATE
REDNECK/HILLBILLY
IS SITTING RIGHT THERE
AT THE END.
JEFF, WOULD YOU LICENSE THIS?
IF YOU CAN GET JEFF TO COME IN
ON THE DEAL, I'LL MAKE AN OFFER.
BUT I WANT 100% OF THE NAME.
I JUST WANT TO BUY THE NAME
AND PAY YOU BACK A ROYALTY FEE
ON IT.
JEFF, DO YOU WANNA COME IN
ON IT?
WHAT KIND OF ROYALTY
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
I MEAN, I THINK WE WOULD
PAY THEM BACK A 7% FEE
ON ANY FUTURE DEALS.
I JUST WANNA LICENSE IT
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,
HAVE THE CHECK SHOW UP,
AND YOU GET A FEE OUT OF THAT.
BUT WE??WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANNA
GIVE UP OUR WHOLE DREAM.
I MEAN, WE CREATED THIS.
SO...
I MEAN, WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTNER
WITH YOU OR ANY OF THE SHARKS
AS??AS LONG AS WE'RE INVOLVED.
WE KNOW HOW TO SELL IT.
IT'S NOT A DREAM
TILL IT MAKES MONEY.
IT'S JUST A NIGHTMARE
TILL THEN.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA
GIVE UP 100% OF OUR COMPANY,
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE KNOW
HOW TO SELL THIS.
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH YOU LICENSE
IT, SOMEONE'S STILL GOTTA GO OUT
AND SELL IT, YOU KNOW.
JEFF, ARE YOU IN ON IT?
'CAUSE THAT'S
PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME.
YEAH. I?I'LL GO IN ON THAT
WITH YOU, ROBERT.
SO YOU'VE GOT THE KING
OF HILLBILLY AND REDNECK
WILLING TO USE HIS NAME
AND LICENSE IT.
DAYMOND, YOU WANT IN?
I THINK THAT IF THE GUYS
GO OUT AND LICENSE IT...
AHEM, WITH MY EXPERTISE...
(laughs)
UH, YOU KNOW??
JEFF, I THINK DAYMOND BRINGS
SOME VALUE.
I THINK DAYMOND BRINGS
A LOT OF VALUE.
ALL RIGHT, SO LET ME??
LET ME REPHRASE THE DEAL.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, JEFF.
GUYS, YOU'RE GONNA GET $50,000
SPLIT BETWEEN JEFF, DAYMOND,
AND I,
FOR THE RIGHTS TO THE NAME
IN EXCHANGE FOR A ROYALTY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I THINK WHAT WE'D LIKE
IS IF WE COULD GO UP
TO MAYBE $100,000,
10% INSTEAD OF 7%
ON THE ROYALTIES,
AND THEN SOME TYPE
OF GUARANTEE
THAT IF YOU GUYS JUST SAT IT
ON THE SHELF,
WE'D HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO TAKE IT BACK AT SOME POINT.
YOU'RE NOT HILLBILLIES.
I'M GONNA DEFER THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION BACK TO JEFF.
IS IT WORTH THE $100,000?
MAN, I GOTTA TELL YOU.
EMOTIONALLY, I'M??I'M TORN.
BECAUSE I WAS YOU 25 YEARS AGO,
GETTIN' UP
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING
AND DOING 15 RADIO SHOWS
DOING REDNECK JOKES,
TRYING TO DEVELOP THAT BRAND.
(Daymond) TOUGH ONE.
I WAS??I WAS THEM AS WELL.
YEAH.
THEN HAVE A HEART, GUYS,
AND OPEN YOUR BIG, FAT WALLETS
RIGHT HERE. LET'S GO.
BARBARA, ENOUGH WITH THE...
I WILL COUNTER WITH $75,000,
7% ROYALTY.
$25,000 EACH.
$25,000 EACH.
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
YEAH.
GUYS, $75,000.
WE GET THE NAME.
YOU GET A 7% ROYALTY.
THE 10% IS...
OUT OF THE QUESTION?
I THINK 7% IS GENEROUS.
I THINK YOU GUYS KNOW THAT.
7% IS??IS INDUSTRY STANDARD.
(Robert and Daymond)
WE NEED AN ANSWER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S DEAL?
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. DEAL.
(Robert) ALL RIGHT!
(Jeff) YEEHAW!
YEEHAW!
WHOO!
(Shon) YOU LIKE THAT, HUH, JEFF?
(Daymond) I'M ALREADY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU GUYS.
(Robert) COME ON, JEFF.
PUT YOUR HAT ON, GUYS. YEAH!
(Mike) I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE THAT. LOOKS GOOD, MAN.
(Daymond) ALL RIGHT, MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.
HEY, JEFF, THANKS.
(Jeff) THANKS, MAN.
IT COULD WORK.
(sighs)
DO OR DIE, MAN. WHEW!
IT MEANS A LOT TO HAVE A DEAL
WITH FOXWORTHY.
I MEAN, THAT GUY <i>IS</i> COUNTRY,
YOU KNOW.
HE LIVES AND BREATHES COUNTRY.
SO FOR US TO HAVE A LICENSING
DEAL WITH HIM BACKING IT
IS AMAZING,
AND I THINK THIS IS
PROBABLY THE BEST THING
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO US.
