HI. MY NAME'S KEN HOWELL.
I'M FROM
FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA,
CAREFUL NOW, KEN.
(laughs)
(Ken) EVERYBODY LOVES
THE BEEF JERKY.
WHAT'S THE STORY? IS THIS
THE BEST YOU'VE EVER EATEN?
IT'S GOOD, VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
KEN, WHY IS IT CALLED
UNCLE ZIP?
MY FATHER WAS ACTUALLY
IN THE YELLOW PAGE SALES,
NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT
THE $25,000 FOR, KEN?
THE $25,000 IS??WE'RE GONNA
START OUT BY UPGRADING
THE??THE, UM,
PROCESSING FACILITY
I ALREADY HAVE.
THAT'S GONNA ALLOW US
(Robert) BUT, KEN,
ISN'T THAT JUST CRAZY?
EVERY TIME YOU OPEN UP
A NEW REGION,
YOU NEED
A NEW PROCESSING PLANT?
WELL, THAT??THAT NEW REGION
IS GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT
FRESH BEEF JERKY ON THE SHELF
THAT OTHERWISE HAS BEEN
SITTING THERE FOR A YEAR.
I GOT A CARPET BUSINESS
THAT I DO??DO PART?TIME, TOO.
KEN, IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS,
(Robert) KEN,
WE ALL HAVE A DREAM.
BUT NOT ONLY DOES EVERY DREAM
HAVE A PRICE,
EVERY DREAM HAS A SHELF LIFE,
JUST LIKE YOUR BEEF JERKY.
RIGHT.
THIS ISN'T
AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
OKAY. OKAY.
THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS,
NOT AN INVESTMENT.
I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA TELL IT
THE WAY IT IS.
LOOK, I LOVE THE STORY,
I LOVE THE PAST,
I LOVE ALL THAT STUFF,
BUT I'M AN INVESTOR, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, KEN, I'M GONNA??
I'M GONNA SAY THIS.
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
OKAY.
IT TASTES FRESH.
IT TASTES GOOD.
I'M OUT...
BUT MAINLY BECAUSE
I'M IN THE SAME BUSINESS.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
BUT I THINK
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE
THAT YOU COULD MAKE A GOOD
LIVING ON WITH THE RIGHT THINGS.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S BIG ENOUGH YET
