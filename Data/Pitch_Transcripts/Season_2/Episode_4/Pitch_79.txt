I'M KEN HOWELL,
AND THE NAME OF MY BUSINESS
IS UNCLE ZIP'S BEEF JERKY.
WHAT MAKES MY BEEF JERKY
SO SPECIAL??
IT COMES FROM A FAMILY RECIPE.
MINE'S FRESH AND 100% NATURAL.
HEY! ANYBODY NEED JERKY?!
PEOPLE IN THE TOWN,
THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY JERKY.
THEY COME TO THE SPORTING EVENTS
THAT I GO TO, THEY'RE ALWAYS,
"UNCLE ZIP! HEY. WHAT'S GOING
ON? GIVE ME SOME JERKY.
GIVE ME SOME JERKY."
HEY!
BASICALLY,
I'M A ONE?MAN BAND.
UNCLE ZIP!
WHAT'S HAPPENIN', Y'ALL?
THIS ISN'T JUST A BUSINESS
TO ME. THIS IS A PASSION.
MY DAD ORIGINALLY STARTED
THE BUSINESS.
HE WAS THE ORIGINAL UNCLE ZIP.
ABOUT FIVE, SIX YEARS AGO,
HE PASSED AWAY.
SO I WANT TO CONTINUE ON
HIS LEGACY AND MAKE HIM PROUD.
I KNOW MY BUSINESS CAN BE
REALLY SUCCESSFUL
AND JUST WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF HELP,
I CAN TAKE IT
FROM A HOMETOWN BUSINESS
TO A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BRAND
IN STORES EVERYWHERE,
ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.
HI. MY NAME'S KEN HOWELL.
I'M FROM
FAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA,
AND THE NAME OF MY COMPANY
IS UNCLE ZIP'S BEEF JERKY.
NOW I'M ASKING
FOR A $25,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 20% PARTNERSHIP
IN MY COMPANY.
NOW WHAT MAKES UNCLE ZIP'S
BEEF JERKY BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER
BEEF JERKY OUT THERE?
IT'S THE FRESH TASTE.
YOU SEE, I DON'T USE
ANY ADDITIVES, NO PRESERVATIVES.
A LOT OF PEOPLE, WHEN THEY HAVE
THAT MASS?PRODUCED STUFF,
THEY SAY IT'S TOUGH
AND THEY TASTE
THAT CHEMICAL TASTE, YOU KNOW,
THAT CHEMICAL BLAH TASTE.
MINE IS FRESH, FRESH MADE.
NOW I GOT A SAMPLE
IF YOU WANT SOME.
HERE YOU GO.
YOU KNOW, I TRIED THAT
JEFF FOXWORTHY BEEF JERKY.
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT,
ROBERT?
WELL, I LOVED IT, JEFF.
HOW DOES THIS COMPARE?
IT IS REALLY, HANDS DOWN??
CAREFUL NOW, KEN.
(laughs)
(Ken) EVERYBODY LOVES
THE BEEF JERKY.
WHAT'S THE STORY? IS THIS
THE BEST YOU'VE EVER EATEN?
IT'S GOOD, VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
KEN, WHY IS IT CALLED
UNCLE ZIP?
MY FATHER WAS ACTUALLY
IN THE YELLOW PAGE SALES,
AND HE WAS REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
HE COULD ZIP IN, ZIP OUT
WITH A SALE, SO ZIP STUCK.
WELL, HE ORIGINALLY STARTED
THE BEEF JERKY. HE WAS LIKE,
"WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA DO
ZIP'S BEEF JERKY."
SO I SAID, "YEAH, YEAH,"
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE GOES,
"YEAH, GOOD OL' UNCLE ZIP,"
AND I WENT... "(gasps)
THAT'S IT.
UNCLE ZIP'S BEEF JERKY."
I SAID,
"THAT'D BE PERFECT."
NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS ME AS EITHER
UNCLE ZIP OR JERKY MAN.
HONESTLY, I CAN GO WALKING INTO
A?ANY STORE,
AND I'LL HEAR, "JERKY MAN.
HEY, HEY, JERKY MAN. JERKY MAN.
JERKY MAN."
(sharks laugh)
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
HOW DOES IT STAY IN THE PACKAGE
WITHOUT PRESERVATIVES,
WITHOUT CHEMICALS?
DOES IT GO BAD RIGHT AWAY?
NO, IT DOESN'T GO BAD
RIGHT AWAY,
BUT HERE'S THE THING,
I PUT ABOUT A TWO MONTH,
UM, SHELF LIFE ON IT.
ISN'T THAT A PROBLEM?
DOESN'T THAT BEEF JERKY
STAY ON FOR YEARS
ON THE SHELF?
EXACTLY, AND THE REASON WHY
IT DOES STAY ON FOR YEARS
IS BECAUSE OF THOSE??
LIKE I SAID BEFORE,
IS THOSE CHEMICALS
THAT ARE IN THERE,
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU'RE TASTING.
HOW MUCH SALES HAVE YOU HAD
IN THE LAST YEAR?
RIGHT. WELL, UNFORTUNATELY...
IN THE LAST??IN THE LAST??
OH! YOU'RE STARTING OFF
WITH "UNFORTUNATELY"? LET'S GO.
WELL, IN THE LAST COUPLE OF??
ACTUALLY, THE LAST SEVEN YEARS,
I?I'VE BEEN KINDA DOWN
FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT
I LOST MY??I LOST MY FATHER.
I'M ALMOST
IN A REBUILDING STAGE.
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR SEVEN YEARS?
I?I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR
RIGHT AT TEN YEARS NOW.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
THE HIGHEST SALES,
I WAS RIGHT AT $100,000.
THAT WAS RIGHT BEFORE
MY DAD TOOK ILL.
AND WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR?
UM, IT WAS??
YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING??
IT WAS ABOUT
$40,000 OR $50,000.
NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT
THE $25,000 FOR, KEN?
THE $25,000 IS??WE'RE GONNA
START OUT BY UPGRADING
THE??THE, UM,
PROCESSING FACILITY
I ALREADY HAVE.
THAT'S GONNA ALLOW US
TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND
INTO THESE LARGER MARKETS.
ONCE WE GET IN THERE, WE'LL HAVE
SMALL PROCESSING PLANTS.
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
TO OPEN UP ON OF THESE,
YOU'RE LOOKING ABOUT $60,000,
AND THAT'S THE??
(Robert) BUT, KEN,
ISN'T THAT JUST CRAZY?
EVERY TIME YOU OPEN UP
A NEW REGION,
YOU NEED
A NEW PROCESSING PLANT?
WELL, THAT??THAT NEW REGION
IS GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT
FRESH BEEF JERKY ON THE SHELF
THAT OTHERWISE HAS BEEN
SITTING THERE FOR A YEAR.
AND THAT'S THE THING??
NOBODY KNOWS REALLY FRESH
BEEF JERKY.
I DON'T THINK
THE PROBLEM IS GONNA BE
HAVING THE LOCAL
PROCESSING PLANT.
I DON'T THINK YOUR SHELF LIFE
IS LONG ENOUGH.
YOU CAN'T BE MAKING A LIVING
ON??ON THIS.
WELL, I?I DO HAVE
A LITTLE PART?TIME??
I GOT A CARPET BUSINESS
THAT I DO??DO PART?TIME, TOO.
KEN, IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS,
AND YOU'RE STILL NOT MAKING
A LIVING DOING IT.
I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.
ARE YOU STILL DOING IT
BECAUSE IT'S A BUSINESS?
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A TRIBUTE
TO YOUR DAD?
IT DOES LEAN
A LITTLE BIT TOWARDS,
THAT WAS MY DAD,
AND HE WANTED THE BUSINESS.
AND WE TALKED MANY TIMES
ABOUT WANTING
TO PUT IT ON SHELVES.
AND I JUST??I JUST KNOW
I CAN DO IT.
JUST LIKE ANY BUSINESS, WHEN
THEY HIT THAT??THAT LITTLE HUMP,
THEY JUST NEED THAT LITTLE BOOST
OF CAPITAL TO GET ROLLING AGAIN.
AND I??AND I REALLY THINK
THIS RIGHT HERE,
PARTNERING UP WITH YOU GUYS??
ONE OF YOU, TWO OF YOU,
ALL OF YOU??
I REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN
GET THIS BACK??BACK ON TRACK
AND GET GOING AGAIN.
(Robert) KEN,
WE ALL HAVE A DREAM.
BUT NOT ONLY DOES EVERY DREAM
HAVE A PRICE,
EVERY DREAM HAS A SHELF LIFE,
JUST LIKE YOUR BEEF JERKY.
RIGHT.
THIS ISN'T
AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
OKAY. OKAY.
THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS,
NOT AN INVESTMENT.
I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA TELL IT
THE WAY IT IS.
LOOK, I LOVE THE STORY,
I LOVE THE PAST,
I LOVE ALL THAT STUFF,
BUT I'M AN INVESTOR, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT YOU PRESENTED
IS A SMALL, REGIONAL BRAND??
A MICRO BRAND, REALLY SMALL.
IT'S GOOD. I ATE IT.
IT IS FRESH. THAT'S GREAT.
THE TROUBLE IS,
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THAT MUCH.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, KEN, I'M GONNA??
I'M GONNA SAY THIS.
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
OKAY.
IT TASTES FRESH.
IT TASTES GOOD.
I'M OUT...
BUT MAINLY BECAUSE
I'M IN THE SAME BUSINESS.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
BUT I THINK
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE
THAT YOU COULD MAKE A GOOD
LIVING ON WITH THE RIGHT THINGS.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S BIG ENOUGH YET
FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO COME IN
AND INVEST IN IT,
BUT YOUR PRODUCT'S GOOD ENOUGH
THAT YOU COULD MAKE
A GOOD LIVING ON IT.
YOU KNOW, YOU MADE $100,000
IN YOUR THIRD YEAR
IN THE BUSINESS, OKAY?
THEN YOU CAME THROUGH
YEARS OF HARDSHIP
FOR ONE REASON OR THE OTHER.
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT OBSTACLES
TO OVERCOME
THAN SELLING BEEF JERKY.
RIGHT.
THERE'S NO HELP YOU NEED
FROM ANYBODY
TO GET THIS BACK ON THE ROAD.
YOU'VE GOT IT IN YOU.
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED US HERE.
YOU'RE VERY CAPABLE
OF GETTING BACK ON YOUR FEET,
SO I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT. THANKS, Y'ALL.
I APPRECIATE IT.
WE'LL SEE YA. (sighs)
(groans)
(chuckles)
I'M JUST
GONNA KEEP PRESSIN' ON,
BECAUSE THAT??
I?I KNOW THIS WILL MAKE IT.
WHEW.
OH.
AND...
(voice breaking)
AND I KNOW THEY SAID THAT,
ARE YOU HOLDING ON BECAUSE...
WHEW.
MAYBE I AM.
MAYBE I AM HOLDING ON
'CAUSE OF MY DAD.
(sniffles)
BUT IT'S SOMETHING
I LOVE TO DO, TOO.
(sniffles) I JUST...
(sniffles)
I'M NOT GON' QUIT.
