(Darryl) COME ON.
COME ON, HONEY.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DARRYL.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND RANDY.
WE'RE FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA.
AND OUR BUSINESS
IS RIDE ON CARRY ON.
WE'RE ASKING FOR $50,000
FOR A 25% EQUITY
IN OUR BUSINESS.
NOW DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
THE WAY TO TRAVEL?
ANYONE WHO'S TRAVELED TODAY
HAS SEEN THIS SCENARIO PLAY OUT
IN AIRPORTS ALL ACROSS
THE COUNTRY EVERY DAY.
NOW I'VE BEEN A FLIGHT ATTENDANT
FOR 27 YEARS.
I'VE WATCHED COUNTLESS FAMILIES
DEAL WITH THE FRUSTRATIONS
OF TRAVELING
WITH SMALL CHILDREN.
ANYONE WHO HAS KIDS
KNOWS HOW STRESSFUL IT CAN BE.
BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVE
AT THE AIRPORT,
YOU'RE DEALING WITH...
(laughs)
PULLING YOUR CUMBERSOME STROLLER
OUT OF THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR...
(grunts) OH, CAN YOU HOLD
MY DAUGHTER?
OH, THANK YOU. OH, SORRY.
SURE. BE HAPPY TO.
(laughs)
OH.
BY THE TIME
YOU GET TO YOUR GATE,
YOU ARE TEARING
YOUR HAIRS OUT.
IT'S JUST A NIGHTMARE.
THAT'S WHY RANDY AND I
CAME UP WITH
THE RIDE ON CARRY ON.
(Robert laughs)
NOW THE RIDE ON CARRY ON
INSTANTLY CONVERTS
ANY WHEELED CARRY?ON LUGGAGE
INTO A TRAVEL STROLLER.
IT CARRIES ANY CHILD
8 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS
SAFELY AND COMFORTABLY
THROUGH ANY AIRPORT,
TRAIN STATION, OR BUS STATION.
ONCE THERE,
YOUR LITTLE ONE HOPS OUT.
THE RIDE ON CARRY ON FOLDS
AGAINST THE TOP OF THE LUGGAGE.
IT EASILY STOWS
IN THE OVERHEAD BIN.
WHEN YOU GET
TO YOUR FINAL DESTINATION,
YOU PULL YOUR LUGGAGE DOWN,
YOU OPEN THE SEAT,
YOUR LITTLE ONE HOPS IN,
BUCKLE THE SEAT BELT,
AND AWAY YOU GO.
IT'S SO EASY.
WE'VE ALSO DESIGNED A HEADREST
FOR TALLER CHILDREN.
IT EASILY CONVERTS
INTO A HANDY TRAY TABLE
FOR EATING AND PLAYING
WHILE YOU WAIT.
NOW WE HAVE SOLD THOUSANDS
OF THESE ON THE INTERNET.
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP GETTING
INTO THE RETAIL MARKET,
BECAUSE IT IS TIME FOR PEOPLE
TO TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF
TRAVELING WITH LITTLE ONES.
THE KIDS ABSOLUTELY LOVE
THE RIDE.
PARENTS LOVE THE CONVENIENCE.
ANY QUESTIONS?
YES. YOUR DAUGHTER'S
NOT BREATHING.
UH, Y?YEAH, SHE'S QUIET.
SHE LOOKS??SHE'S NOT??
NO, SHE'S QUIET.
SHE'S NOT HAPPY BECAUSE SHE'S
NOT IN A RIDE ON CARRY ON.
I THOUGHT THE RIDE AND CARRY
MIGHT HAVE KILLED HER.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
EXACTLY. (laughs)
DARRYL, YOU HAVE A LAWN CHAIR
STRAPPED TO A PIECE OF LUGGAGE.
EXACTLY.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED.
MY FRIENDS AND PILOTS
AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
HELPED US DESIGN, UH,
THE WHOLE CHAIR.
THEY TOOK OUR PROTOTYPES
ON TRIPS.
AND IT JUST WAS PHENOMENAL??
THE ATTENTION EVERYBODY GOT, UH,
WHEELING THROUGH THE AIRPORT??
AND THAT'S WHEN WE KNEW
WE REALLY HAD SOMETHING.
AND WHAT AGE
WILL IT WORK?
8 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS.
WE, UM, MY DAUGHTER USED IT
TILL SHE WAS ABOUT 6. CHILDREN??
IS THERE A SEAT BELT
ON IT?
THERE ABSOLUTELY IS A SEAT BELT
WITH A CROTCH STRAP, YEAH.
(Randy) 3?POINT??
ARE??ARE YOU SELLING
THE CHAIR SEPARATELY,
AND THEN I STRAP IT ON
TO ANY PIECE OF LUGGAGE?
(Darryl and Randy) YES.
THAT'S HOW WE DESIGNED IT.
YOU SAID THOUSANDS
HAVE BEEN SOLD. HOW??
WE SOLD UP??ALMOST 20,000
OUT OF OUR HOUSE.
WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR NUMBER
IN THE LAST YEAR?
WE SOLD 2,000 CHAIRS
LAST YEAR.
AT WHAT PRICE?
(Darryl and Randy) $39.95.
AND WHAT DO YOU PAY
TO MAKE ONE?
$7.
(Barbara and Robert) $7?
(Darryl) YES.
GOOD MARGIN.
(Jeff) WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
I'M A POOL MAN,
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.
WERE YOU MARRIED BEFORE AND HE??
RANDY WAS THE POOL MAN?
NO.
NO, NO, THAT NEVER HAPPENS.
IT'S ONLY IN THE MOVIES.
OH. (laughs)
YEAH, YEAH, ONLY??
ONLY IN THE MOVIES.
WE MET IN A BAR
IN FORT LAUDERDALE 19 YEARS AGO.
STICK WITH THE POOL MAN STORY.
IT'S BETTER.
(laughs) YEAH, EXACTLY.
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
FIRST OF ALL, I?I LOVE
A?A WOMAN NAMED DARRYL.
(laughs) THANK YOU.
(laughs)
BECAUSE MY WIFE'S NAME
IS GREGG.
OH. I FEEL FOR HER, TOO.
(laughs)
MY FIRST THOUGHT IS, YOU'VE
NEVER HAD ANY SAFETY ISSUES?
BECAUSE I DO WORRY ABOUT
THE LIABILITY ON THIS.
ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S BEEN SAFETY TESTED
IN THE U. S. AND IN EUROPE.
PASSED ALL THE SAFETY TESTS.
UH, ALL THE CHAIRS WE'VE SOLD
HAVE HAD NO SAFETY ISSUES.
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
ONE COMPLAINT.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THIS?
WHEN WE CAME OUT
WITH THE IDEA??
OUR SON WAS 2
WHEN WE THOUGHT OF IT.
HE'S 16 NOW, BUT WE??
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR 14 YEARS?
THE FIRST FIVE OR SIX YEARS,
WE PLAYED WITH THE IDEA.
I HAD TO CONVINCE MY HUSBAND
TO INVEST IN THE PATENT.
YOU KNOW, THAT TOOK SOME TIME.
WE MORTGAGED THE HOUSE
FOR $150,000.
MORTGAGED THE HOUSE.
DID YOU MAKE BACK
THAT $150,000?
WE HAVE NO DEBT.
YEAH, WE HAVE NO DEBT.
WE'RE IN THE BLACK.
AND YOU MADE IT BACK
WITH THE CHAIRS?
(Darryl and Randy) YES.
(Robert)
WOW. GOOD FOR YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
WITH THE $50,000?
PRODUCT AWARENESS.
GET OUR WEB SITE??
IT'S NOT OPTIMIZED AT ALL.
OPTIMIZE THE WEB SITE.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
IT EXISTS.
LET'S GET BACK TO THE PATH
TO RICHES HERE.
FORGET ALL THIS "YOU DO
YOUR OWN RETAIL" STUFF.
YOU KNOW
THAT'S A SLAUGHTERFEST.
WE REALLY THOUGHT THAT, UM,
GETTING INTO THE RETAIL MARKET
WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO.
WE WANT PEOPLE
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.
AS A PARENT,
I WOULD BE INTERESTED
TO HAVE A?A MAJOR LUGGAGE
MANUFACTURER...
RIGHT.
HAVE??HAVE A MODEL
WHERE THIS IS BUILT IN.
THE REALITY IS, THOUGH,
LUGGAGE IS VERY EXPENSIVE.
IS SOMEBODY GONNA BUY
A SPECIAL PIECE OF LUGGAGE
JUST TO HAUL
THEIR CHILDREN AROUND?
WHAT IF THEIR CHILDREN
AREN'T TRAVELING WITH THEM?
(Kevin) I'LL TELL YOU, RANDY...
SO??
YOU COULD ADD ONE FEATURE
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
MAKE IT SO I COULD CHECK
THE KID WITH THE LUGGAGE.
(laughs)
(laughs)
AND HOW MUCH INVENTORY
DO YOU HAVE?
(Darryl and Randy) ZERO.
HOW MANY ORDERS
DO YOU HAVE PENDING?
WE HAVE 2,000 RIGHT NOW,
PENDING??
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE
ARE RETAILERS OUT THERE
OR SOMEBODY EXISTING SAYING
THAT WE NEED 2,000 OF THESE?
(Darryl and Randy) YES.
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT IDEA.
AND THAT'S 90% OF IT.
WHEN WE HEARD YOU MIGHT BE ON,
WE SAID,
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A REDNECK
WHEN YOUR KIDS
ARE STRAPPED TO YOUR LUGGAGE
GOING THROUGH THE AIRPORT.
(Robert laughs) YEAH.
THAT'S NOT EVEN YOU MIGHT BE.
YOU ARE. YOU ARE AT THAT POINT.
(all laugh)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM.
I?I AM JUST NOT
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
HOLDING HANDS UP THERE.
THAT'S GREAT.
FOR ME, THE PATH TO WHAT YOU
NEED TO DO IS SO OBVIOUS.
AND YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH ME,
BUT I THINK
IT'S A LICENSING IDEA.
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED
TO BE HERE ASKING FOR MONEY.
I WOULD LICENSE IT.
I'M OUT.
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,
"BUSINESSWEEK"
PICKED THIS
AS ONE OF THEIR TOP 25 BEST...
TOP...
(Darryl and Randy)
NEW PRODUCTS OF THE YEAR.
AND WE WERE THE ONLY COMPANY
THAT WASN'T FORTUNE 500.
FORTUNE 500.
I'D LIKE TO PUT AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE.
$50,000, EXACTLY AS YOU STATED,
FOR 25%,
WITH THE ONLY CONTINGENCY BEING
THAT WE BRAND THAT TRAY
WITH YOUR RIDE ON CARRY ON,
BIG AND BOLD.
I THINK IT'S A CATALOG SALE.
I THINK IT'S A RETAIL SALE.
I DON'T GO ALONG
WITH THE WAY OF THINKING
THAT IT SHOULD BE SOLD
TO A LUGGAGE COMPANY.
I THINK IT'S??IT'S SEPARATE.
WELL, I LOVE??I LOVE
THE NEGOTIATION, BARBARA...
YEAH. WHAT?
WHERE YOU OFFER 'EM EXACTLY
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.
HEY, IT'S WORTH IT.
I COULD SEE THIS THING
SELLING LIKE HOTCAKES.
(Darryl) OH, ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK
YOU NEED HELP MARKETING.
OH, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.
WE DEFINITELY DO.
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
WE ARE WORKING
FULL?TIME JOBS??
YOU ARE ADORABLE TOGETHER.
(Darryl laughs) THANK YOU.
OKAY, DARRYL AND RANDY,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
IT GOES LIKE THIS.
OKAY, DARRYL AND RANDY,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
AND IT GOES LIKE THIS??
INSTEAD OF, UM, TAKING 25%,
I'M WILLING TO DO IT
FOR 20%, BUT...
STOP MANUFACTURING
ANY OF THIS ON YOUR OWN.
STOP SELLING IT
ON THE INTERNET COMPLETELY.
AND YOU USE THOSE DOLLARS
TO GO FIND ME
TWO DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS
THAT MAKE THOSE BAGS
THAT OWN 80% SHARE
OF THE MARKET,
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO DO THE WORK.
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BRING THEM TO ME,
AND I'LL NEGOTIATE
THE LICENSE DEAL.
WHEN THEY'RE READY TO NEGOTIATE,
YOU GIVE ME THEIR PHONE NUMBER,
AND YOU'LL KEEP 80%,
AND I'LL TAKE
20% OF EVERYTHING FOREVER.
YOU'RE GONNA SAY, "WOW.
"I COULD TAKE
UNCLE KEVIN'S $50,000,
LIVE OFF THAT"??
CAN YOU EVEN IMAGINE
CALLING THIS GUY "UNCLE KEVIN"?
(Darryl laughs)
I THOUGHT HE??
I THOUGHT HE WAS MEAN KEVIN.
(Kevin) NO, I??
I'LL LET YOU IN ON A SECRET.
EVERYBODY CALLS ME
MR. WONDERFUL.
OH, THERE WE GO.
'CAUSE I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW
THE LUGGAGE BUSINESS, GUYS,
BUT I CERTAINLY KNOW
HOW TO NEGOTIATE A LICENSE DEAL.
I'M VERY GOOD AT THAT.
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW EVERYTHING
ABOUT EVERY BUSINESS.
NO, BUT I'M WILLING
TO ADMIT WHAT I DON'T KNOW,
ROBERT, UNLIKE YOU.
I THINK BARBARA'S GIVING YOU
A GREAT DEAL,
AND I THAT HE'S GIVING YOU
A SUCKER DEAL. UM, I'M OUT.
OH, LISTEN TO THAT.
HE BRINGS NO MONEY.
HE MAKES NOISE. TYPICAL.
OKAY, SO YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
BARBARA KEEPS YOU
IN A MANUFACTURING HELLHOLE.
FOR ME, IT'S A SMALL,
FOCUSED PERIOD OF TIME
WHERE YOU GO GET ME
TWO MANUFACTURERS,
GET ME THE PHONE NUMBER
OF THE LICENSING GUY IN EACH,
AND I'LL COME HOME
WITH THE DEAL.
(Barbara) YOU KNOW,
HE'S MAKING A LICENSING DEAL
SOUND LIKE IT'S ROCKET SCIENCE.
IT REALLY ISN'T.
ANY HALF?DECENT ATTORNEY
COULD NEGOTIATE THAT DEAL.
DON'T BE WOWED
BY HIS FANCY WORDS.
JUST LOOK AT THIS GUY.
LOOK WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.
(laughter)
AND THINK, DO YOU WANT TO DO
BUSINESS WITH THIS GUY?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY
THEY CALL ME MR. WONDERFUL,
BECAUSE EVERY DEAL THAT COMES
OUT OF MY LIPS <i>IS</i> WONDERFUL,
IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND BY THE WAY, TO KEVIN'S
POINT ABOUT LICENSING,
I'M NOT RULING THAT OUT.
I JUST DON'T LIKE PUTTING
ALL MY EGGS IN ONE BASKET
BECAUSE WHAT YOU NEED MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE IS MARKETING HELP.
RIGHT. CORRECT.
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
IT'S TIME TO MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WE WANT TO GO WITH BARBARA.
WE THINK WE'LL HAVE FUN
WORKING WITH BARBARA.
BUT I STILL LOVE YOU, KEVIN.
(Barbara) RIGHT DECISION.
(Kevin)
OH, YOU BROKE MY HEART.
MY PLEASURE. GREAT JOB.
YAY! THANK YOU, BARBARA! WE'RE
GONNA HAVE FUN WORKING TOGETHER.
(Darryl) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
(sighs)
THANK YOU.
WHOO?HOO!
(laughs)
AWESOME.
WHEW.
(Daymond) GOOD DEAL, BARBARA.
(Barbara) YOU KNOW,
THE MAIN POINT IS,
IS THAT NOBODY WANTS
TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
HAVE YOU GOTTEN ON TO THAT?
I??YOU KNOW,
MY DEALS ARE GOOD.
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAPPEN...
YEAH.
THEY MAKE MONEY,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
EVERYBODY SAYS "NO, THANK YOU.
NO, THANK YOU. NO, THANK YOU."
NO, BARBARA, BECAUSE I THINK
WHEN THEY FINALLY FIGURE IT OUT
AFTER TWO YEARS
OF SWEATING IT OUT
TRYING TO MANUFACTURE
THIS STUFF,
THEY'LL SAY, "I WISH I'D DONE
THAT DEAL WITH UNCLE KEVIN."
I'M SURE.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.
EXACTLY. I?I KNOW I'M RIGHT.
KEVIN, WHO EXACTLY IS CALLING
YOU MR. WONDERFUL, BY THE WAY?
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.
(all laugh)
WE ARE SO EXCITED THAT WE WERE
ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL,
BUT WE ARE EVEN MORE EXCITED
FOR THE KIDS OF AMERICA
THAT CAN FINALLY HAVE FUN
TRAVELING THROUGH AN AIRPORT.
YEAH.
(laughs)
