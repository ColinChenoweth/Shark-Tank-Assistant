YOU'RE SUCKING THE LIFE
OUT OF GEORGE.
YOU'RE GETTING EXCITED.
(laughs)
WOW.
HELLO, EVERYONE.
MY NAME IS GEORGE PODD.
THIS IS ROLF SCHWARTZ.
AND WE REPRESENT
LIGHTFILM LLC.
TODAY WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEKING
$100,000
FOR A 5% OWNERSHIP STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
OUR PRODUCT IS A LIGHT?UP DECAL
FOR CAR WINDOWS.
RIGHT HERE IS MY CAR
WITH THE AMERICAN WAVING FLAG.
I HAVE PEOPLE PULL ME OVER
SAYING, "WHAT IS THAT?
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE."
THIS WAVES WITH A MOTION SENSOR
AND A LIGHT SENSOR.
IT KNOWS WHEN TO GO ON
BY ITSELF.
WE KNOW WE HAVE A WINNER
WITH THIS ITEM.
WE'VE MARKET TESTED IT
AT THE TRADE?SHOW LEVEL.
IT'S A SIMPLE APPLICATION.
IT'S A PEEL AND STICK.
YOU PEEL IT,
AND THEN YOU STICK IT
ON YOUR WINDOW
JUST LIKE THIS.
IT'S A FLUSH MOUNTED.
NO TOOLS REQUIRED.
ONCE IT'S IN, YOU'RE DONE.
IS THERE A WIRE
ATTACHED TO THAT?
THERE'S A WIRE ATTACHED
IN THIS ONE.
THIS IS
GENERATION ONE PRODUCT.
WE'RE INTO
OUR GENERATION TWO PRODUCT,
WHICH WE'RE MOVING INTO
A CORDLESS APPLICATION.
RIGHT NOW.
(O'Leary) HOW DOES IT GET
POWERED IF IT'S CORDLESS?
UH, THROUGH A BATTERY PACK,
AND THEN ALSO WE'VE GOT
THE SOLAR CHARGE CHARGING
THE BATTERY DURING THE DAY.
SO DURING THE DAY,
IT'S A REGULAR DECAL.
AND THEN AT NIGHTTIME,
IT LIGHTS UP AND ANIMATES.
DO YOU OWN A PATENT?
YES.
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
A PATENT APPLICATION.
SO IT'S CURRENTLY FILED.
GEORGE, IS THIS A SAFETY DEVICE
OR IS IT A??
WELL, THE KEY MARKET IS
FOR THE BRAND AFFINITY??
THE GUY
THAT GOES TO A COLLEGE
AND HE WANTS THAT LOGO
ON HIS VEHICLE, PRO SPORTS??
IF THERE WAS A KID
IN COLLEGE
AND WANTED
HIS PARTICULAR SPORTS TEAM,
HE ORDERS
THAT SPECIFIC DECAL FROM YOU?
HE COULD DOWN THE ROAD.
NO QUESTION.
YES.
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE.
RIGHT.
YOU'RE HERE TO HELP GET MONEY
FOR DISTRIBUTION,
I'M GOING TO ASSUME.
EXACTLY. WE'LL USE THE $100,000
TO GO AFTER THESE NICHE SECTORS
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE, YOU KNOW,
SOME VERBAL COMMITMENTS
SO THAT WE CAN IN TURN
GO TO A MAJOR RETAILER
WITH CONFIDENCE
AND??AND SOME TRACK RECORD.
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH
THE IDEA? I'D BE SO CURIOUS.
IT'S A GREAT STORY.
UM, MY SON PLAYS HOCKEY.
I WAS DROPPING HIM OFF
AT THE HOCKEY RINK,
AND THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME
HAD THE TEAM LOGO
OF THE HOCKEY TEAM.
AT THE SAME, A CHILD IN THAT
VEHICLE WAS WATCHING CARTOONS
THROUGH THE FLIP?DOWN
DVD MONITOR.
AND I WAS WATCHING HIS CARTOON
RIGHT THROUGH
THE BACK OF THE WINDOW.
AND I'M LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU??YOU GOT A LOGO
AND YOU GOT CARTOONS
AND ANIMATION.
WHAT IF THE TWO TECHNOLOGIES
MERGED TOGETHER?
IT WOULD BRING STICKERS
AND BRANDING
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
WHERE DID YOU GO FIND IT?
WELL, MY BACKGROUND
IS INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WORKING
ON NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.
THE FIRST PROJECT I WORKED ON
OUT OF COLLEGE
WAS, UH, THE FIRST
HOME PREGNANCY TEST.
I DID THE WHOLE LINE
OF SEARS WET/DRY VACUUM CLEANERS
FOR THE CRAFTSMAN BRAND.
MY BACKGROUND IS FINANCIAL.
I'VE KNOWN GEORGE FOR YEARS,
AND HE TOLD ME ABOUT IT.
I HAD THE VISION RIGHT AWAY.
SO YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TODAY?
THEY'RE??WE??WE??ZERO.
WE'RE WAITING TO GET MONEY
RIGHT NOW.
GEORGE, IF YOU BELIEVE
IN THE PRODUCT,
WHY NOT TAKE SOME OF
YOUR OWN MONEY AND SELL??
I'VE PUT ALL MY MONEY
INTO THIS.
HOW MUCH YOU PUT IN?
UM...
ABOUT $750,000.
PARDON ME?
WHOA.
$750,000?
WOW.
AND IT WENT INTO PURE R&amp;D
TO DEVELOP IT?
R&amp;D.
PATENTS.
HIRED A COUPLE OF LAW FIRMS
TO DO ALL THE DUE DILIGENCE.
THE FIRST THING I CHECKED
WAS THE LEGALITY OF IT...
MM?HMM.
THE STREET LEGAL ASPECT
OF IT.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO PRODUCE ONE LOGO?
AND WHAT COULD YOU
SELL IT FOR?
THIS UNIT HERE,
AROUND $10.
BUT OUR
NEXT GENERATION PRODUCT,
WHICH IS
THE SOLAR BATTERY UNIT,
WE CAN??WE COULD EASILY
MAKE THAT FOR $5 OR LESS
BASED ON VOLUME.
YOU CAN MAKE IT FOR $5
AND YOU SELL IT AT W??
WELL, THE WHOLESALE
WOULD BE $10,
AND THEN THE RETAIL WOULD BE
$19.99 OR, YOU KNOW,
DEPENDING ON WHAT LICENSING
DEAL YOU HAD, TOO, AS WELL.
DO YOU HAVE THOSE
LICENSING DEALS IN PLACE?
WE??WE DON'T
HAVE THEM IN PLACE.
WE HAVE THE GREEN LIGHT
TO TAKE 'EM TO THE NEXT LEVEL
WITH HARLEY?DAVIDSON.
HARLEY??
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THOSE DEALS WILL COST YOU?
DAYMOND, DO YOU HAVE TO
PAY THEM?
OF COURSE YOU DO.
YOU GOTTA PAY 'EM
A DOWN PAYMENT FEE,
AND THEN A??AND THEN YOU HAVE TO
PROMISE TO MAKE X?AMOUNT??
GIVE THEM X?AMOUNT OF DOLLARS
OVER THREE TO FIVE YEARS.
(George) EXACTLY.
(Robert) WOW.
THIS IS WHERE I MADE ALL MY
MONEY, LICENSING OUT MY BRANDS.
SO WE HAVE A GREAT TECHNOLOGY
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
FOR DISPLAY SIGNS.
THAT'S STAGE ONE
OF THIS BUSINESS.
MM?HMM.
NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE
A MARKETING PLAN
AND A SALES PLAN
AND A DISTRIBUTION PLAN...
CORRECT.
TO CAPITALIZE ON IT.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE AT.
CORRECT. RIGHT.
WHY IS $100,000 ENOUGH?
YOU NEED MORE MONEY THAN THAT.
WELL, I THINK I CAN GET
THAT FOUNDATION LEVEL DONE
IN THOSE NICHE SECTORS
THAT THE MONEY WILL GENERATE
BACK ON ITSELF
TO FUND TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
(Robert)
SO ANSWER THIS FOR ME.
HOW DOES IT BECOME
<i>REALLY</i> BIG?
WELL, THAT'S THE NEXT LEVEL
OF FUNDING, OBVIOUSLY.
TO GET IT <i>REALLY</i> BIG, YOU'RE
GONNA NEED A LOT OF CASH,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY
FOR ALL THESE LICENSES.
MM?HMM. MM?HMM.
RIGHT.
(Harrington) GUYS, I'VE??
I'VE MADE MY MIND UP.
I REALLY LIKE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE,
BUT I'M CONCERNED THE $100,000
THAT I WOULD PUT UP
WOULD GO INTO A BLACK HOLE
BECAUSE YOU NEED REALLY
ANOTHER $1 MILLION IMMEDIATELY
TO REALLY TAKE THIS THING
AND DEVELOP IT.
SO I'M GONNA MAKE IT EASY FOR
THE REST OF YOU GUYS. I'M OUT.
THE THING IS,
THIS PRODUCT SCREAMS
FOR A STRATEGIC PARTNER
THAT HAS DISTRIBUTION.
YEP.
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTRIGUING.
IT REALLY IS.
BUT I'M ONLY
HALF THE SOLUTION.
THIS IS ONE OF THESE
RARE SITUATIONS
WHERE CASH IS NOT ENOUGH.
I COULD GIVE YOU $1 MILLION,
AND IT STILL WOULDN'T SOLVE
THE PROBLEM WE ALL
SIT HERE FACING??DISTRIBUTION.
FOR THAT REASON, GUYS,
I'M OUT.
GEORGE, I?I REALLY...
I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I THINK YOU GUYS
DID A GREAT JOB.
BUT AS THE FELLOW SHARK
ILLUSTRATED,
NO AMOUNT OF MONEY
IS GONNA HELP YOU
BRING IT TO MARKET
WITHOUT THE RIGHT PARTNER.
I?I'M OUT.
I'M NOT ONLY THE WRONG PARTNER,
I'M THE WRONG CUSTOMER.
IF MY HUSBAND PUT THAT
ON MY CAR, I'D KILL HIM.
(Robert laughs)
YOU MEAN YOUR ROLLS ROYCE
WOULDN'T LOOK GOOD WITH THAT?
SO I'M OUT.
I WOULD NEED TO ONLY BE IN
IF THE SECOND PHASE WORKS.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE ONE
WITH THE WIRES.
I CAN ACTUALLY
ISSUE YOU SOME LICENSES.
RIGHT.
FORGET EVEN MY FUBU BUSINESS.
IF I GIVE YOU COOGI, ONE OF
MY OTHER LINES, WHICH IS...
OH, COOGI, YEAH.
THE NUMBER ONE URBAN LINE
IN THE COUNTRY,
ALONE YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
$1 MILLION OFF THAT...
MM?HMM.
AS A LICENSE.
MM?HMM.
YOU GO OUT TO A STORE, AND YOU
GET $2 MILLION IN ORDERS,
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
I MANUFACTURE IT,
I SHIP IT, I??
OH, YOU DO
THE MANUFACTURING, TOO?
EVERYTHING, YES.
OOH.
BUT I WOULD ONLY BE IN
IF THE SECOND PHASE WORKS.
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THE ONE WITH THE WIRES.
AND I WOULD NEED
75% OF THE COMPANY.
GEORGE, IS YOUR COUNTER
$100,000?
NO, NO. I DIDN'T GET
TO THE NUMBER YET.
(O'Leary) THAT'S THE POINT.
LET'S HEAR THAT.
WHAT'S THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT?
IT'S ROUGHLY $750,000.
YEAH, BABY.
SO YOUR COUNTER IS $750,000
FOR 51%?
AND HE WOULD R?RUN
THE COMPANY,
AND THEN WE??OBVIOUSLY
WE'D WORK FOR HIM.
AND, ROLF, WHAT'S THE NUMBER
FOR 51% OF THE BUSINESS?
I WANT TO KEEP IT
AROUND THE $750,000,
TO RECOUP
OUR??OUR INVESTMENT.
GUYS, CAN YOU STEP OUT
IN THE HALL FOR A SECOND?
SURE.
DAYMOND,
YOU ARE ONE GREEDY SHARK.
GREEDY, GREEDY, SHARK.
YEAH, BUT HE'S TAKING AWAY
ALL OF HIS FUTURE PROBLEMS.
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A VAMPIRE.
YOU'RE SUCKING THE LIFE
OUT OF GEORGE.
(laughs)
EVERY LAST DROP OF BLOOD,
LEAVING HIM 25% FOR HIS ORGANS
TO JUST SCRATCH OUT A LIVING ON.
(laughs)
(laughs)
WOW.
YOU'RE GETTING EXCITED.
DAYMOND, I'M SENSING IN THE WAY
THAT THEY'RE ANSWERING
THAT THEY WOULD SELL 75%
OF THIS BUSINESS FOR $100,000.
NO. NO WAY.
(O'Leary) NO.
THIS IS IT. I THINK THEY HAVE
NOWHERE LEFT TO GO.
WHY DON'T YOU OFFER 'EM
THE $100,000
AND SEE WHERE THEY GO?
THEN HOW DO THEY GET
THEIR $750,000 BACK?
AND 75 CENTS OUT OF EVERY $1
OF PROFIT GOES TO THEM.
UNTIL THEY GET
THEIR MONEY BACK.
(Robert) YEAH.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE.
(Rolf) THANK YOU.
(Daymond) WE'RE GONNA
MAKE MONEY, ALL RIGHT?
(O'Leary) CONGRATULATIONS.
I JUST SENSED
THIS WAS THE LAST STOP.
YOU WERE ON THEM
LIKE A BUZZARD ON A GUT WAGON
AS SOON AS YOU SAW
THE WAY HE LOOKED.
(laughs) THAT'S ROBERT. YOU JUST
DESCRIBED HIM. HE'S ENTRAILS.
THAT CARCASS HAD ONLY
A LITTLE PIECE OF MEAT ON IT.
I LIKE YOUR STYLE, BABY.
THE VAMPIRE AND THE LEECH.
GIVING UP 70% OF OUR COMPANY,
UH, IS??IS KIND OF SHOCKING,
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN LIVING
AS THE OWNERS OF THIS COMPANY
FOR THREE YEARS.
HOWEVER, WE THOUGHT
IT WAS MOST IMPORTANT THAT
WE GOT WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE
TO MAKE LIGHTFILM
AT THE HIGH LEVEL
WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO.
