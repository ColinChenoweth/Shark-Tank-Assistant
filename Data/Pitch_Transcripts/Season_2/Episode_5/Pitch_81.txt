MY NAME IS JAN AUGENSTEIN,
HELLO.
MY NAME IS JAN AUGENSTEIN,
JAN, UM, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHAT'S BASE HOUSING?
OH, MILITARY BASE HOUSING.
JAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
YES. I STARTED IN '05.
WE GOT OUR PATENT AT THAT TIME.
JAN, YOU'RE??YOU'RE
AT THE MERCY OF ONE SUPPLIER?
WE WERE AT THE TIME, YEAH.
WE'RE FROM A SMALL TOWN IN OHIO,
WE WERE JUST GETTING STARTED.
WE HAD NOT
DONE TRADE SHOWS YET.
SINCE THAT TIME,
WE'VE DONE A FEW TRADE SHOWS
AND BY THAT TIME,
PEOPLE LOST INTEREST.
JAN,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THAT MAGNETIC FILM,
IS THERE?
WE CAN DO??
THIS IS AN ADHESIVE.
WE CAN DO A FOIL ADHESIVE
TO THE MAGNET.
BUT??BUT WHAT IS THE PATENT?
IT'S A UTILITY PATENT
THAT WE DID GET.
SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN PUT A STICKER
ON A FRIDGE?
MAGNETIC, YES.
DO YOU HAVE PRODUCT NOW?
YES.
YES, I HAVE 1,500 BLANK SHEETS
THAT ARE READY FOR PRINTING.
JAN, I'M CURIOUS. HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU HAVE IN??IN THIS?
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.
$250,000 SO FAR.
WHERE THE HECK
DID YOU GET $250,000
FOR A REFRIGERATOR MAGNET?
MY BROTHER.
HE REALLY BELIEVED IN MY IDEA,
SO HE SUPPORTED ME
JAN, GREAT PRESENTATION. YOU
SEEM LIKE A VERY NICE PERSON.
FOR ME, IT'S TOO SMALL,
A VERY CUSTOM?ORIENTED BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION
ON WHERE I CAN
HELP TAKE THIS BUSINESS,
SO WITH THAT,
I'M GONNA RESPECTFULLY BE OUT.
JAN, I HAVE A QUESTION.
JAN, I HAVE A QUESTION.
HOW MUCH INVENTORY
DO YOU NEED HERE?
THE MAJORITY HAS BEEN, LIKE,
FOR, OUR BEACH PRINT,
THANK YOU, JAN.
(laughs) THANK YOU.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK TO BOTH OF US.
THANK YOU. I'M SO HAPPY.
THANK YOU.
GREAT.
YES!
THE SHARK TANK WAS MY LAST HOPE
FOR THE BUSINESS.
IF I HAD NOT HAD THIS DEAL,
THE COMPANY WAS JUST GONNA
FIZZLE OUT IN MY BASEMENT.
