MY NAME IS JAN AUGENSTEIN,
AND I'M FROM
YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO.
FOR MY DAY JOB, I WORK IN
REAL ESTATE AND I REHAB HOMES.
IN THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES,
PEOPLE STILL WANT TO REDECORATE
AND MAKE THEIR SPACES BEAUTIFUL,
BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY TO DO IT.
BUT I HAVE FOUND A WAY
THAT YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND CREATE THAT BEAUTIFUL SPACE
ON A VERY LIMITED BUDGET.
FAMILY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD TO ME,
AND ACTUALLY, MY BROTHER
SUPPORTED ME IN THIS VENTURE.
I TURNED TO HIM FOR MONEY,
AND HE PARTNERED WITH ME
IN THIS IN THE BEGINNING.
OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS,
MY BROTHER HAS INVESTED
SO MUCH MONEY IN THE PRODUCT.
WE'VE HAD SOME SETBACKS.
I'M SO SORRY
IT DIDN'T GO BETTER.
OH, NO, IT'S FINE.
I MEAN, IT'S??IT'S A RISK.
I TOOK IT. WE TOOK IT.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT, JUST...
IT'D BE NICE
IF WE HAD SOME HELP.
I LOSE SLEEP AT NIGHT THINKING
HOW MUCH MONEY I OWE MY BROTHER.
I KNOW THAT MY BROTHER
BELIEVES IN ME,
BUT I WOULD BE
TOTALLY HEARTBROKEN
IF... IF??IF I COULDN'T DO IT.
(voice breaking) IF THE SHARKS
DON'T INVEST IN MY COMPANY,
MY BROTHER WILL BE OUT $250,000,
I MAY BE OUT OF MY HOUSE.
I JUST DON'T KNOW.
HELLO.
MY NAME IS JAN AUGENSTEIN,
AND I'M FROM
YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO.
MY PRODUCT IS FridgeFronts,
AND I'M ASKING FOR $100,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR
30% OF MY COMPANY.
I WAS LIVING IN BASE HOUSING
IN 1999,
AND WE HAD
A HIDEOUS REFRIGERATOR.
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT
IN LOVE WITH IN YOUR HOME.
JAN, UM, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHAT'S BASE HOUSING?
OH, MILITARY BASE HOUSING.
I WAS AN AIR FORCE WIFE,
AND I LIVED ON A MILITARY BASE.
AND THEY PROVIDE HOUSING
FOR YOU.
AND BAD FRIDGES.
YES. SO I CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA
BECAUSE WE HAD AN APPLIANCE
VERY SIMILAR TO THIS.
IN FACT, THIS PROBABLY
COULD'VE BEEN IT.
SO MY PRODUCT, FridgeFronts,
IS A MAGNETIC SKIN
THAT'S A DECORATIVE FINISH,
AND YOU CAN EASILY
CUT IT WITH SCISSORS
AND APPLY TO ANY APPLIANCE
JUST LIKE THAT.
IT'S VERY EASY TO DO.
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
SO IN THIS ECONOMY, YOU MAY
HAVE A FRIDGE THAT WORKS,
BUT THAT'S JUST UNATTRACTIVE
AND UNAPPEALING.
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PURCHASE
THIS FOR UNDER $100,
AND CHANGE THE COMPLETE LOOK
OF YOUR APPLIANCE.
I ALSO HAVE OTHER DESIGNS.
MOST PEOPLE LIKE STAINLESS.
SO I HAVE STAINLESS FINISH.
I CAN DO DECORATIVE FINISHES.
ANYTHING??JUST FUNKY.
WE CAN GET CRAZY.
THE??THE??THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE COMPLETELY ENDLESS.
JAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
YES. I STARTED IN '05.
WE GOT OUR PATENT AT THAT TIME.
AND THE FIRST THING WE DID
WAS SkyMall.
SO I THINK WE DID
$40,000 IN SALES.
DID YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR THAT SPACE IN SkyMall?
YES, I DID.
YEAH.
IT WAS ABOUT $18,000.
SO YOU??ON $18,000,
YOU GENERATED $40,000 IN SALES.
MM?HMM. YES.
WAS THAT ABOUT A BREAK EVEN
FOR YOU, GIVE OR TAKE,
OR DID YOU MAKE
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY?
WELL, NO.
WHAT HAD HAPPENED IS,
WE WERE SORT OF AT THE MERCY
OF OUR PRINT HOUSE.
AND THEY HAD QUOTED
A PRICE FOR US,
AND WE SIGNED ALL THE PAPERWORK.
THEY CAME BACK
A COUPLE MONTHS LATER
BEFORE IT WENT INTO THE CATALOG,
AND CHARGED US
AN ADDITIONAL $10.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT
IN THE CONTRACT
WITH THAT PARTICULAR SUPPLIER?
NO.
JAN, YOU'RE??YOU'RE
AT THE MERCY OF ONE SUPPLIER?
WE WERE AT THE TIME, YEAH.
WE'RE FROM A SMALL TOWN IN OHIO,
WE WERE JUST GETTING STARTED.
WE HAD NOT
DONE TRADE SHOWS YET.
SINCE THAT TIME,
WE'VE DONE A FEW TRADE SHOWS
AND MADE SOME CONNECTIONS.
SO WE COULD DO THIS
BY HAVING IT DONE OVERSEAS
AT A CHEAPER COST.
BESIDES THAT ONE SkyMall TEST,
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SALES?
YES. ACTUALLY, THE OTHER THING
THAT HAPPENED,
IN '08, RACHAEL RAY
FOUND US ONLINE.
THEY WANTED TO RECREATE
A KITCHEN JUST LIKE RACHAEL'S.
THEY USED OUR PRODUCT.
I MADE A CUSTOM ONE FOR THEM.
THEY PUT IT ON AIR. WE DIDN'T
KNOW HOW MUCH SERVER ACTIVITY
WE WOULD NEED TO SUPPORT IT.
SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
OUR SERVERS CRASHED...
OH, GOSH.
WE HAD SO MANY HITS.
AFTER YOU GOT HOW MANY ORDERS
DID IT CRASH?
WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER
LITTLE PROBLEM. (laughs)
OH.
I HATE TO??I KNOW.
IT'S A LOT OF NEGATIVITY??
OH, MY GOSH.
I KNOW.
(Robert) YEAH.
BUT WE KEEP GETTING UP
AND TRYING. IT'S LIKE A PHOENIX.
SO WHAT HAPPENED THAT TIME
IS THE, UM, PRINT COMPANY WE
WERE WORKING WITH WENT BANKRUPT.
OUR PRODUCT, WHICH WE'D ALREADY
PAID FOR, WAS STUCK
IN THEIR
BANKRUPTCY WAREHOUSE.
SO WE HAD TO BUY IT BACK, WHICH
HELD US UP, LIKE, TWO MONTHS.
AND BY THAT TIME,
PEOPLE LOST INTEREST.
JAN,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THAT MAGNETIC FILM,
IS THERE?
WE CAN DO??
THIS IS AN ADHESIVE.
WE CAN DO A FOIL ADHESIVE
TO THE MAGNET.
BUT??BUT WHAT IS THE PATENT?
IT'S A UTILITY PATENT
THAT WE DID GET.
SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN PUT A STICKER
ON A FRIDGE?
MAGNETIC, YES.
DO YOU HAVE PRODUCT NOW?
YES.
YES, I HAVE 1,500 BLANK SHEETS
THAT ARE READY FOR PRINTING.
AND THEN I HAVE
ABOUT A THOUSAND
OF OUR OLD PRINTED DESIGNS
IN A WAREHOUSE.
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU
WHAT MODEL FRIDGE I HAVE
OR I CAN CUT IT?
WE WENT TO
A ONE FILM LIKE THIS,
A SKIN
THAT YOU CAN CUT YOURSELF.
JAN, I'M CURIOUS. HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU HAVE IN??IN THIS?
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.
$250,000 SO FAR.
WHERE THE HECK
DID YOU GET $250,000
FOR A REFRIGERATOR MAGNET?
MY BROTHER.
HE REALLY BELIEVED IN MY IDEA,
SO HE SUPPORTED ME
AND HE INVESTED.
I FEEL OBLIGATED TO REPAY HIM.
AND HE STILL BELIEVES IN ME
AND THE PRODUCT, BUT HE JUST
COULD NOT CONTINUE TO PUMP
THE MONEY INTO THE MAGNETS.
AND SO HE KINDA
GOT BURNED OUT.
VERY PRAGMATIC, I MUST SAY,
BUT IT'S NOT A COMPANY.
IT??IT'S ACTUALLY A PRODUCT.
I CAN SEE HOW??HOW THIS WOULD
BE SOMETHING PEOPLE BUY,
BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT
A COMPANY,
I'M OUT.
JAN, GREAT PRESENTATION. YOU
SEEM LIKE A VERY NICE PERSON.
FOR ME, IT'S TOO SMALL,
A VERY CUSTOM?ORIENTED BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION
ON WHERE I CAN
HELP TAKE THIS BUSINESS,
SO WITH THAT,
I'M GONNA RESPECTFULLY BE OUT.
JAN, I HAVE A QUESTION.
JAN, I HAVE A QUESTION.
HOW MUCH INVENTORY
DO YOU NEED HERE?
THE MAJORITY HAS BEEN, LIKE,
FOR, OUR BEACH PRINT,
AND I WAS GONNA SHOW YOU THAT.
CAN??MAY I?
YEAH.
AND THESE ARE JUST
FROM OUR EARLY DESIGNS.
(Robert) OH, LOOK AT THAT.
THAT'S A PRETTY LOOK.
YEAH, AND WHAT WE CAN DO??
THE THING I'M MOST EXCITED
ABOUT, WE ONLY HAD FIVE DESIGNS,
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH A PROPER
INPUT, IS TO HAVE A WEB SITE
WHERE YOU CAN SEND IN
YOUR OWN IMAGE.
WE CAN CUSTOMIZE IT??
YOUR KIDS, YOUR FAMILY,
YOUR DOGS, YOUR CAT.
YOU COULD ALSO DO
YOUR DISHWASHER...
YEAH.
AND YOUR MICROWAVE
AND WHATEVER??
I MEAN, OTHER THINGS
AROUND THE KITCHEN, RIGHT?
EVEN WASHER AND DRYERS,
MM?HMM.
UM, I HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS.
I THINK IT'S A CHEAP ASS WAY
TO DOLL UP A REFRIGERATOR
AS WELL AS OTHER APPLIANCES.
SO IF YOU'D BE WILLING
TO JUST LIMIT YOURSELF TO THREE
BEST?SELLING DESIGNS...
THEN I WOULD GIVE YOU
HALF THE MONEY.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
ANOTHER SHARK
TO GIVE YOU THE OTHER HALF.
THANK YOU, JAN.
(laughs) THANK YOU.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK TO BOTH OF US.
THANK YOU. I'M SO HAPPY.
THANK YOU.
GREAT.
YES!
THE SHARK TANK WAS MY LAST HOPE
FOR THE BUSINESS.
IF I HAD NOT HAD THIS DEAL,
THE COMPANY WAS JUST GONNA
FIZZLE OUT IN MY BASEMENT.
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
THE SHARK TANK WORKS.
ALAN, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I'LL LIVE AND DIE WITH YOU GUYS.
YOU GOT A DEAL.
WE GOT IT. GOOD.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY, GOOD JOB.
THANKS, ALAN.
I LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.
(keys jangle)
POWERFUL,
SUGAR?FREE MINT AND GUM,
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET
YOUR BREATH FRESHENER AGAIN.
THE MINT AND GUM BUSINESS
HAS ANNUAL SALES
IN THE BILLIONS,
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
BLOWING BUBBLES ANYMORE.
FUNCTIONAL PRODUCTS
WITH ENHANCEMENTS
IS GROWING
IN THE MULTI?BILLIONS.
I WANT TO TAKE
MY EXISTING MINT AND GUM
IN A WHOLE NEW DIRECTION,
ADDING ENHANCEMENTS,
LIKE VITAMINS AND ANTIOXIDANTS.
I'M ALSO INTRODUCING
MY CLIP'n'GO
DUAL?SIDED CONTACT LENS CASE.
YOU FILL IT
WITH REWETTING SOLUTION
AND AN EXTRA SET
OF CONTACT LENSES,
AND IT CLIPS RIGHT ON
TO YOUR BACKPACK OR KEYCHAIN.
MY PRODUCTS ARE WHAT YOU NEED
WHEN YOU NEED IT.
AND WITH YOUR INVESTMENT TODAY
AND YOUR EXPERTISE,
WE CAN TAKE THIS
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
WHAT DOES
THE CONTACT LENS STUFF
HAVE TO DO WITH THE GUM?
WELL, THEY'RE
TWO SEPARATE PRODUCTS,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
THEY'RE CLIP'n'GO.
THEY'RE FOR PEOPLE ON THE GO.
ARE YOU REALLY IN
THE CONTAINER BUSINESS
OR THE MINT BUSINESS
OR THE GUM BUSINESS
OR ALL OF THE ABOVE?
(Robert)
OR THE CONTACT BUSINESS?
ALL OF THE ABOVE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
OF ALL THIS STUFF?
WE HAD $817,000 OF SALE??
OF??OF CASH LAST YEAR
IN SALES.
OH, WHOA.
WE HAVE NOT INTRODUCED
THE LENZ YET AT ALL.
WE WERE IN WALGREENS
AND WE WERE IN WINN?DIXIE.
AND??AND RIGHT NOW
WE'RE ON AMAZON AND??
THE WORDS "WERE" AND "$800,000"
DON'T REALLY
GO TOGETHER THAT WELL.
WELL,
WE RAN OUT OF PRODUCT.
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?
YOU GOT A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS,
YOU GOT $800,000 IN SALES,
AND YOU RUN OUT OF PRODUCT?
IF YOU WORKED FOR ME,
I'D FIRE YOU RIGHT NOW.
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT G??
ABOUT GOING AGAINST
THE BIG BRANDS
IS THAT GETTING SHELF SPACE,
GETTING ON THERE??
IT'S VERY HARD
TO STAY ON THERE.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON $817,000?
WELL, WE HAVEN'T MADE
REAL PROFIT YET.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WELL, WE PUT IT BACK
INTO THE BUSINESS.
(Robert)
YOU SAY YOU DON'T HAVE??
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE COME OUT ONTO THIS CARPET
THAT NEVER HAD ANYTHING NEAR
WHAT YOU HAD IN SALES?
$800,000,
AND IT JUST VAPORIZED?
OVERHEAD WAS RIDICULOUS.
WELL, THAT'S YOUR FAULT.
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WENT WRONG.
YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T HAVE SALES
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ORDER.
IS IT BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
FINANCE THE ORDERS
OR IS IT BECAUSE
PEOPLE JUST STOPPED BUYING?
WELL, SOME OF THE??
SOME OF THE PLACES
THAT WE HAD THEM IN,
SOME OF THE STORES, WERE DOING
IT FOR PROMOTIONAL PERIODS.
IT WOULD RUN??
BUT WHY DIDN'T THEY REORDER?
THEY CHANGE ALL THE TIME.
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY
IN THE CONFECTION
AND THE MINT AND GUM??
NOT THE MAINSTREAM BRANDS. YOU
CAN STILL FIND THE SAME GUM??
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
