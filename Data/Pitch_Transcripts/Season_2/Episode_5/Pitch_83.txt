I'M APRIL MORRIS.
I'M FROM FISHERS, INDIANA.
EXPRESS EFFECTS COSMETICS.
THIS IS APRIL.
I'VE INVESTED
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.
HELLO. MY NAME IS APRIL MORRIS.
I'M THE CREATOR OF THINgloss.
I'M SEEKING
AN $80,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 20%
EQUITY STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
SEVERAL YEARS AGO,
I ATTENDED A CHRISTMAS PARTY
APRIL, WHAT ARE
YOUR SALES TODAY?
$26,000 AT THE END
OF LAST YEAR.
WHAT ARE YOU ON TRACK FOR
FOR THIS YEAR?
ACTUALLY, MY PERSONAL GOAL IS
TO DO $1 MILLION IN GROSS SALES
I'M FOR CERTAIN
THAT IT'S GONNA GET THERE.
SO, APRIL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF CLINICAL STUDIES
ON THE PRODUCT
THAT WILL ALLOW YOU
TO MAKE THOSE CLAIMS?
I HAVE SPOKEN TO
AN F. D. A. ATTORNEY
TO INSURE THAT
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
IN TALKING ABOUT THINgloss
AS A COSMETIC??
THAT IT ACTUALLY ENHANCES
THE APPEARANCE OF WOMEN??
NO, NOT WITHOUT
A CLINICAL STUDY.
APRIL, CAN I??CAN I TRY IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
(Barbara)
SO WHAT'S THE THINKING
THAT YOU SMELL IT
30 MINUTES BEFORE YOU EAT?
WELL, WHAT I DISCOVERED,
UH, IS THAT INHALING
CERTAIN AROMAS THROUGH THE NOSE
CAN INSTANTLY, UM, HELP TO
ENHANCE YOUR MOOD,
HAVE YOU BEEN TO INDIA, APRIL?
I HAVE NOT.
I'VE BEEN TO INDIA.
HOW MUCH IS IT, APRIL?
THINgloss SELLS FOR $28.
WOW. WOW.
(Robert) $28 FOR THIS?
(April) YES.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.
HOW MUCH IS NORMAL LIP GLOSS
FOR A WOMAN?
$8.
YOU CAN GET AN $8 LIP GLOSS
PROBABLY AT A DRUG STORE.
BUT WHEN YOU GO
INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE,
YOU CAN FIND LIP GLOSSES
ANYWHERE FROM $18 UP TO $40.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
PER CAPSULE OR TUBE?
APRIL, I WOULD BE VERY NERVOUS
ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED WITH IT
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY LEGAL, UH,
CATEGORY??WEIGHT LOSS.
