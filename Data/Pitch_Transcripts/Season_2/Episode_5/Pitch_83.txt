(Robert) HOW MUCH IS LEFT, BOB?
THERE ISN'T.
(Daymond) I'M OUT AGAIN.
(laughs)
IF YOU WORKED FOR ME,
I'D FIRE YOU RIGHT NOW.
DAYMOND, YOU ARE
ONE GREEDY SHARK.
YOU'RE A VAMPIRE.
(laughs)
HELLO, EVERYONE.
MY NAME IS BOB KROUPA.
I'M HERE TODAY
LOOKING FOR $500,000
FOR A 30% STAKE IN MY COMPANY
NEW ERA BRANDS??
CLIP'n'GO MINT AND GUM
AND CLIP'n'GO CONTACT LENS CASE
PRODUCT LINES.
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
FORGET THEIR BREATH FRESHENER.
BUT WITH MY CONVENIENT
CLIP?ON CASE
THAT CLIPS ON
TO YOUR BACKPACK, KEYCHAIN
OR PURSE STRAP...
FILLED WITH MY...
BOB, THAT'S HARD, BUT YOU'RE NOT
DOING A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING,
'CAUSE SOMEWHERE,
YOU'RE LOSING ME.
(O'Leary) LET ME TRANSLATE,
'CAUSE I THINK I GOT IT.
YOU HAVE A NOVELTY ITEM
THAT SELLS A COMMODITY??
MINTS AND GUMS.
RETAILERS BROUGHT IT IN
BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.
THEY LOOK
AT THE MARGIN THEY MAKE
AND HOW MUCH SHELF SPACE
YOUR PRODUCT TAKES UP,
DIDN'T MEET THE HURDLE.
THEY REPLACED YOUR STUFF
WITH OTHER STUFF THAT DOES.
IF YOU CAN'T BEAT RUBBER BOOTS,
FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA STAY IN.
THEY WANT TO PUT
RUBBER BOOTS THERE INSTEAD.
YOU HAD A SUGAR SPIKE.
YOU WENT UP TO $800,000
AND STRAIGHT BACK DOWN
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
STAY ON THE SHELF.
TRUE OR FALSE?
UM, WELL, THEY OR??
THEY REORDERED AND REORDERED.
AND THEN THEY...
STOPPED BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MEET
THE GROSS MARGIN
PER LINEAR INCH.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. RIGHT?
IS THAT CORRECT? YES??JUST??
IS THAT CORRECT, YES OR NO?
YES. YES.
OKAY, ROB, ROB.
MM?HMM.
I'M OUT.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE
ON $817,000?
OUR MARGIN'S
ARE ABOUT 32%.
SO ON $800,000 IN SALES,
YOU MADE ABOUT $240,000?
RIGHT.
AND THEN YOU PAID
YOUR EXPENSES, YOURSELF.
WHAT WAS LEFT
AT THE END OF THE DAY?
WELL??WELL, I HAD A, UH,
AN OPERATIONS MANAGER
AND A PRESIDENT
WHO WAS REALLY DOING
A LOT OF THE RUNNING
OF THE DAY?TO?DAY BUSINESS.
DID YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY
YOU HAD TO THROW AT THIS,
AND HOW MUCH DID YOU PUT IN?
COUPLE MILLION.
(Robert) SORRY. YOU PUT WHAT?
A COUPLE MILLION.
OF YOUR MONEY?
YEAH.
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT MONEY FROM?
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
I DID WHAT YOU DID.
REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.
GO BACK TO IT.
SO, BOB, SERIOUSLY,
$2 MILLION?
YEAH.
AND HOW MUCH OF IT
DO YOU HAVE LEFT?
MOST OF IT
WAS OVERHEAD.
AS I SAID, WE MADE MISTAKES.
I MEAN, I GOTTA BE HONEST.
THERE WERE MISTAKES.
OUR OVERHEAD WAS RIDICULOUS.
HOW MUCH WERE YOU PAYING
THESE OTHER GUYS IN OVERHEAD?
$60,000 A MONTH.
OH.
YEAH.
(Daymond) THIS IS GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE.
I'M COMING TO WORK FOR YOU.
I WANT A JOB WITH YOU.
BOB, HONEY, SWEETIE,
POOPSIE BABY,
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
HOW MUCH DID YOU GET
OUT OF THAT?
WERE YOU ON A BIG SALARY,
ROLLING IN THE DOUGH?
NO, I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING.
EVERY QUESTION,
IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE.
HOW MUCH IS LEFT, BOB?
THERE ISN'T.
IT'S GONE?
YEAH.
(groans)
SO ARE YOU STILL FUNDING IT?
ARE YOU PUTTING MORE IN?
NO, I HAVEN'T
FUNDED IT AT ALL.
HE'S COME HERE TO FUND IT
WITH YOUR MONEY.
(laughs)
BOB, BA?BASICALLY
WHAT I'VE LEARNED,
THANKS TO BARBARA'S QUESTION,
IS YOU TOOK $2 MILLION,
HIRED SOME EXPENSIVE GUYS
THAT GOT YOU
$800,000 IN SALES.
THE SALES WENT AWAY.
YOU FIRED THOSE GUYS.
$2 MILLION'S GONE.
YOU'RE DOWN TO ZERO.
AND YOU'VE INVENTED
TWO NEW PRODUCT LINES,
AND YOU WANT
TO START OVER AGAIN.
ABSOLUTELY.
I'M OUT AGAIN.
(sharks laugh)
BOB, IT'S NOT AN INVESTMENT
THAT??THAT I WOULD MAKE.
I'M OUT ALSO.
BOB, YOU'RE ALL OVER THE MAP,
MULTIPLE, UH,
PRODUCT LINES
THAT AREN'T RELATED.
THE ONE PRODUCT THAT WAS
SUCCESSFUL IS NOW AT ZERO.
THEN YOU INVENTED OTHER STUFF.
I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO
CHEW ON IT FROM EVERY ANGLE,
AND IT??
AND I STILL GET TO ZERO.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
(O'Leary) BOB, I CAN'T DO IT.

A MIXED?UP PRESENTATION.
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE A DECENT SALESMAN.
