I'M APRIL MORRIS.
I'M FROM FISHERS, INDIANA.
AND I'VE CREATED A PRODUCT
THAT HELPS WOMEN
LOOK AND FEEL FABULOUS.
MY COMPANY IS MORE THAN
JUST A BUSINESS TO ME.
IT'S A MESSAGE OF HOPE
THAT ANY DREAM IS POSSIBLE.
AT 17 YEARS OLD, MY PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE ABRUPTLY ENDED
BECAUSE I FOUND OUT THAT
I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY SON.
I GOT MARRIED, 13 MONTHS LATER
I HAD MY DAUGHTER.
AND THEN
I FOUND MYSELF DIVORCED.
I BECAME A SINGLE MOM WITH
TWO KIDS TO RAISE ON MY OWN.
AND I THOUGHT,
I REFUSE TO LIVE
A LIFE OF MEDIOCRITY,
AND I REFUSE
TO BE ANOTHER STATISTIC
OF LIVING OF WELFARE,
AND I'M JUST
GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.
AND THEN ONE DAY,
I STUMBLED UPON THIS IDEA
THAT JUST CAME OUT OF THE BLUE.
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
THE MONEY TO START IT.
SO THEN I THOUGHT,
WHAT ABOUT REAL ESTATE?
IT TURNS OUT
I WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL,
AND I SOLD OVER $9 MILLION
IN REAL ESTATE IN ONE YEAR.
I WAS SO GRATEFUL.
AND I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH MONEY.
SO I QUIT SELLING HOMES,
AND THAT'S WHEN I LAUNCHED
MY BUSINESS.
EXPRESS EFFECTS COSMETICS.
THIS IS APRIL.
I'VE INVESTED
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.
AND I'M JUST
RUNNING OUT OF MONEY.
AND I NEED THE SHARKS' HELP
TO GET ME TO WHERE I NEED TO BE
SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE
TO LIVE MY DREAM.
AND I'M NOT GIVING UP.
HELLO. MY NAME IS APRIL MORRIS.
I'M THE CREATOR OF THINgloss.
I'M SEEKING
AN $80,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 20%
EQUITY STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
SEVERAL YEARS AGO,
I ATTENDED A CHRISTMAS PARTY
AND I DISCOVERED THAT TWO LADIES
AT THE PARTY THAT I HAD MET
REFERRED TO ME AS CHUBBY.
SO I BEGAN
TO TAKE DIET PILLS.
THEY SEEMED TO WORK,
BUT THE SIDE EFFECTS
WERE MAKING ME JITTERY,
AND I?I JUST COULDN'T
FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT,
SO I STOPPED TAKING THEM.
SOMETIME LATER,
I WAS DRIVING IN MY CAR,
AND I BEGAN TO REAPPLY MY
LIP GLOSS IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR
SITTING AT A RED LIGHT
WAITING ON THE LIGHT TO CHANGE,
AND THAT'S
WHEN THE IDEA CAME TO ME.
I THOUGHT, OH MY GOSH.
I WONDER IF THERE'S A SMELL
OR AN HERB OR SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN PUT IN A LIP GLOSS
THAT MAY HELP
TO CURB MY APPETITE
OR AT LEAST
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
SO I BEGAN TO DO
A TON OF RESEARCH.
AND I DISCOVERED HOODIA.
HOODIA IS AN HERB FROM
SOUTH AFRICA THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO FOOL YOUR BRAIN
INTO BELIEVING YOUR FULL.
I FOUND OTHER STUDIES
ON OTHER AROMAS.
WHEN INHALED,
THEY HELP TO ENHANCE ENERGY
AND BOOST YOUR MOOD.
SO I STARTED THE DEVELOPMENT
BY COMBINING
ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS
INTO ONE PRODUCT,
WHICH IS THINgloss.
THINgloss HAS THREE STEPS.
STEP ONE, YOU ACTUALLY
INHALE THE AROMA
THROUGH THE NOSE
30 MINUTES BEFORE YOU EAT.
STEP TWO, IT AC??
YOU ACTUALLY APPLY IT
LIBERALLY ALL OVER THE LIPS,
LIKE SO.
AND STEP THREE, SMILE
AND ENJOY THE BENEFITS.
APRIL, WHAT ARE
YOUR SALES TODAY?
$26,000 AT THE END
OF LAST YEAR.
WHAT ARE YOU ON TRACK FOR
FOR THIS YEAR?
ACTUALLY, MY PERSONAL GOAL IS
TO DO $1 MILLION IN GROSS SALES
BY JULY 1, 2010.
(Barbara) AND HOW MUCH
IS IT SO FAR??
OKAY, BUT JUST SO FAR
THIS YEAR?
$18,000.
$18,000.
WOW.
YOU MAY NOT GET TO LAST YEAR'S
SALES AT THIS RATE.
WITH SOME NEW THINGS COMING UP
AND IN THE WORKS,
I'M FOR CERTAIN
THAT IT'S GONNA GET THERE.
SO, APRIL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF CLINICAL STUDIES
ON THE PRODUCT
THAT WILL ALLOW YOU
TO MAKE THOSE CLAIMS?
I HAVE SPOKEN TO
AN F. D. A. ATTORNEY
TO INSURE THAT
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
IN TALKING ABOUT THINgloss
AS A COSMETIC??
THAT IT ACTUALLY ENHANCES
THE APPEARANCE OF WOMEN??
AND SO THAT'S
WHAT I RECOMMEND
IS FOR WOMEN TO TRY IT
FOR THEMSELVES
TO SEE HOW IT WORKS FOR THEM.
BUT SEE, YOU'RE NOT??YOU'RE
NOT SAYING IT'S A COSMETIC.
YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT WILL
HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT.
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE??
IS SHE ALLOWED
TO DO THAT, KEVIN?
NO, NOT WITHOUT
A CLINICAL STUDY.
APRIL, CAN I??CAN I TRY IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
(Barbara)
SO WHAT'S THE THINKING
THAT YOU SMELL IT
30 MINUTES BEFORE YOU EAT?
WELL, WHAT I DISCOVERED,
UH, IS THAT INHALING
CERTAIN AROMAS THROUGH THE NOSE
CAN INSTANTLY, UM, HELP TO
ENHANCE YOUR MOOD,
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
AND ENHANCE ENERGY.
MM?HMM.
WOW. IT SMELLS GREAT.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN
GO TO $1 MILLION IMMEDIATELY?
WELL, I ACTUALLY HAVE
A CONTRACT
WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST
COSMETIC DISTRIBUTORS
FOR THE COUNTRY OF INDIA.
WHY??WHY DO YOU THINK IND??
INDIA IS SLATED TO HAVE
THE HIGHEST PERCENT OF INCREASE
IN COSMETIC PRODUCTS.
ARE YOU GOING TO INDIA 'CAUSE
YOU CAN GET AROUND THIS ISSUE
THAT KEVIN HARRINGTON
IDENTIFIED??
YOU'RE MAKING A WEIGHT LOSS
CLAIM WITHOUT A CLINICAL STUDY?
I'VE??LIKE I SAID, I'VE SPOKEN
TO AN F. D. A. ATTORNEY.
AND I'M ON TRACK TO KEEP WITHIN
THE GUIDELINES OF THE F. D. A.
LET'S DEAL
WITH THE FACTS.
YOU CAN'T PUT THIS
INTO A LARGE BOX STORE
AND PUT A SIGN UP AND SAY,
"LOSE WEIGHT."
NO, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WON'T SAY.
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS,
I INVITE MY CUSTOMERS
TO TRY THE PRODUCT
FOR THEMSELVES.
IT'S A COSMETIC, AND IT'S MADE
TO ENHANCE THEIR APPEARANCE
AND MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.
BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT
RIGHT HERE.
IT SAYS "30?DAY
WEIGHT LOSS CHALLENGE."
SHE'S NOT SAYING THAT.
WHAT'S SHE SAYING?
ROBERT, WHEN YOU SHOW
BEFORE AND AFTERS LIKE THAT,
THAT'S MORE THAN IMPLIED.
IT'S WEIGHT LOSS.
THAT'S THE SAME AS??
IS THE LAW CLEAR ON THAT?
OH, YEAH.
HAVE YOU BEEN TO INDIA, APRIL?
I HAVE NOT.
I'VE BEEN TO INDIA.
AND, UH, I'LL TELL YOU THIS??
IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.
IT WOULD BE
BEYOND SHOCKING TO ME
THAT A LIP GLOSS
THAT HELPS PEOPLE LOSE WEIGHT
WOULD BE A HUGE SELLER THERE.
I'D BE VERY CAREFUL
WITH A DISTRIBUTOR
THAT'S TELLING YOU HE'S GONNA
GET YOU TO $1 MILLION IN SALES.
WELL, THERE'S ALSO
HUGE IMPORT DUTIES
BRINGING PRODUCTS
INTO INDIA.
I'M NOT RELYING
ON INDIA TOTALLY
BECAUSE I HAVE
JUST SIGNED AGREEMENTS
WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTORS
IN THE UNITED STATES.
UM, SO I'VE GOT MANY OTHER
THINGS IN THE WORKS AS WELL.
HERE'S THE THING
WITH DISTRIBUTORS??
EVERYBODY IS A DISTRIBUTOR
IF THEY'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY
AND TAKE YOUR PRODUCT.
NOW ARE ANY OF THESE
DISTRIBUTORS OFFERING YOU MONEY
AHEAD OF TIME ON SIGNING?
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
IF YOU GET BIG, AND I WAS
TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOU $80,000,
AND WE AGITATED THE GOVERNMENT
THAT STOPS THIS KIND OF CLAIM,
IT COULD BE BAD FOR BOTH OF US.
THEY CAN BE VERY NASTY
WHEN THEY GET PISSED OFF.
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING
THAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
OF COURSE IT'S ON MY MIND.
MY INTENTION IS TO WORK
WITH THE F. D. A.
AND INSURE THAT I STAY
WITHIN THE GUIDELINES,
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE.
HOW MUCH IS IT, APRIL?
THINgloss SELLS FOR $28.
WOW. WOW.
(Robert) $28 FOR THIS?
(April) YES.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.
HOW MUCH IS NORMAL LIP GLOSS
FOR A WOMAN?
$8.
YOU CAN GET AN $8 LIP GLOSS
PROBABLY AT A DRUG STORE.
BUT WHEN YOU GO
INTO A DEPARTMENT STORE,
YOU CAN FIND LIP GLOSSES
ANYWHERE FROM $18 UP TO $40.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
PER CAPSULE OR TUBE?
BETWEEN $4 AND $5.
BIG MARKUP.
WOW.
(O'Leary) THOSE ARE
FANTASTIC MARGINS.
I'M WONDERING IF YOU'VE
LOST WEIGHT WITH THIS PRODUCT.
I HAVE. I'VE LOST
ALMOST 18 POUNDS SINCE I GOT
THE VERY FIRST SAMPLE
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO.
APRIL, I WOULD BE VERY NERVOUS
ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED WITH IT
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY LEGAL, UH,
CATEGORY??WEIGHT LOSS.
AND I'M GONNA??
I'M OUT ON THIS ONE.
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT
THE F. D. A. THING WITH IT,
SO I'M OUT.
I THINK I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE.
AND, UM...
I COMMEND IT,
BUT I CAN'T ENDORSE IT.
THIS CLAIM
GOES OVER THE EDGE.
KEVIN HARRINGTON FREAKED ME OUT
WITH HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS.
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
