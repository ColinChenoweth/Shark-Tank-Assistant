MY NAME'S SHANE PANNELL.
I'M FROM MARICOPA, ARIZONA.
WHO'S READY TO EAT?
I AM.
HI.
MY NAME IS SHANE PANNELL.
THE NAME OF MY COMPANY IS
SweepEasy.
I'M SEEKING
A $40,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 25% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
NOW FOR CENTURIES,
THE COMMON HOUSE BROOM
HAS BEEN A TRUSTED TOOL TO HELP
PEOPLE CLEAN THEIR FLOORS,
SHANE,
YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THAT?
I DO. IT'S PATENT PENDING
RIGHT NOW.
SHANE, WHERE ARE YOU
SELLING THIS CURRENTLY?
I'M NOT CUR??CERT??
CURRENTLY SELLING IT.
I HAVEN'T SOLD ANY YET,
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
I'M WORKING WITH PROTOTYPES.
THESE ARE PROTOTYPES
THAT I MADE MYSELF.
WHERE DID THIS HIT YOU?
DID YOU HAVE A DREAM
ABOUT SCRAPING CRAP
OFF THE FLOOR?
I BECAME A STAY?AT?HOME DAD
NOT TOO LONG AGO,
SHANE, CAN I TRY?
SO LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.
ROBERT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH.
I WANT TO HAVE YOU COME DOWN
BECAUSE YOU'RE
MY WIFE'S FAVORITE.
SHE LIKES YOUR EYES.
YOU KNOW, SHANE,
I'M THE ONLY GUY HERE
WHO HAS ACTUALLY EVER SWEPT
A FLOOR, I BET.
THEY SAID, "SHANE, <i>WHEN</i> CAN YOU
HAVE A FINISHED PRODUCT?"
DID THEY GIVE YOU
A PURCHASE ORDER?
THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME
A PURCHASE ORDER YET
BECAUSE I'M NOT LICENSED,
BONDED, INSURED.
BUT, SHANE, WHY CAN'T WE GO TO
PEOPLE WHO ALREADY MAKE BROOMS
A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS,
WE'RE DONE.
SHANE, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT
LICENSING THIS
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
I DO THAT, TOO. OKAY?
WHAT I DO THOUGH IS, FIRST I DO
THE TV COMMERCIAL HERE.
THEN WE LICENSE <i>THAT</i>
ALL OVER THE WORLD, OKAY?
SO IT'S A LOT EASIER
TO MAKE THAT PHONE CALL
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK??I THINK
THE BIGGER PROBLEM HERE, SHANE,
IS THAT YOU WANT TO RUN
YOUR OWN COMPANY. CORRECT?
SURE. WITH??WITH...
'CAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANT
TO MAKE PRODUCT.
WITH SOMEONE WITH SOME BUSINESS
SAVVY LIKE YOURSELVES.
LIKE??LIKE, ME, YES.
L?LIKE YOU.
BUT YOU WANT TO RUN
YOUR OWN COMPANY
SHANE, REMEMBER
WHO'S SAYING THIS TO YOU.
BARBARA, IF YOU??BARBARA.
THIS GUY'S A SHARK.
THEY ALL ARE.
SHANE, I'M WITH KEVIN. I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE MONEY.
I'D LIKE TO COME IN
ON THE LICENSING DEAL,
'CAUSE I THINK THAT IS THE ONLY
ROUTE THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.
I'LL PUT UP ANOTHER $40,000
FOR THAT SAME 20%.
$80,000 FOR 20%?
YEAH.
LET'S LIFT IT TO 25%.
OKAY. SO $80,000 FOR 25%,
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH.
LIFE IS VERY SIMPLE.
TWO GUYS WANT TO BUILD BROOMS.
SHANE, I WANT??
I WANT AN ANSWER.
I'M GONNA CALL MY WIFE.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR WIFE.
YOU WANT TO TALK TO MY WIFE?
YEAH. GET HER ON THE PHONE.
I WANT TO TALK TO HER.
I'M ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO WEARS
THE PANTS IN THE FAMILY,
SHANE, I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE
A DECISION RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW...
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY
DIFFERENT TO MY WIFE?
LET'S??I WANT TO TALK TO HER.
WELL...
LET'S TALK TO HER.
YOU KNOW, TALK IS CHEAP.
THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT IT. LET'S TALK.
(Daymond) SHANE, LISTEN.
I'M STARTING...
WE HAVE ANOTHER MINUTE. SHANE,
LET'S HAVE A MINUTE. SILENCE.
ONE SECOND, KEVIN.
I'M STARTING TO RECONSIDER.
I?I MAY RECONSIDER THE OFFER.
YOU KNOW WHY HE'S WORRIED?
(Robert) SHANE, BE A MAN,
FOR GODS SAKE.
OKAY, WELL, SURE.
I?I'M NEGOTIATING, ROBERT.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING.
THANK YOU, MAN.
(Shane) I KNEW YOU WERE THE MAN.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
DEAD MAN SWEEPING.
(laughs)
MAYBE WE LET THEM HAVE CANADA.
NO, WE'LL SEND 'EM SOME BROOMS.
WE'LL SEND 'EM SOME BROOMS.
TO HAVE THEM BE THAT EXCITED
ABOUT MY PRODUCT, IT FELT GOOD,
