SPARTANBURG, SOUTH CAROLINA,
MY NAME IS KIM NELSON,
HEY, KIM, BUT HOW DO YOU??
HOW DO YOU GET THE CUSTOMERS?
WELL, THE BEST WAY TO GET
THE CUSTOMERS IS TO GO
WITH PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH,
WHERE WE'VE GONE.
WE NEED A NUMBER, KIM.
HOW MUCH HAVE
YOUR SALES BEEN?

HEY, KIM...
YES.
KIM, I SEE THIS
AS A WORD?OF?MOUTH TYPE
KIM, I THINK THE BUSINESS IS
TOO SMALL FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.
EVERYBODY'S OUT HERE
EXCEPT BARBARA.
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING,
BARBARA?
I LIKE <i>YOU</i> VERY MUCH.
I THINK IT'S TOO SMALL
A BUSINESS,
QUITE HONESTLY, TO INVEST IN.

YOUR DELICIOUS CAKE AROUND,
