YOU NEED ME TO THINK BIG.
SHANE, GO AND CALL YOUR WIFE.
BARBARA, IF YOU SCREW
THIS UP FOR ME,
EVERYBODY WANTS BETTER
FOR THEIR FAMILY,
SO YOU GOTTA START SOMEWHERE.
I FEEL SO WARM AND FUZZY
I'M GONNA CRY.
MY NAME'S SHANE PANNELL.
I'M FROM MARICOPA, ARIZONA.
WHO'S READY TO EAT?
I AM.
I'M A STAY?AT?HOME DAD,
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
IT IS VERY, VERY CHALLENGING.
HI.
MY NAME IS SHANE PANNELL.
THE NAME OF MY COMPANY IS
SweepEasy.
I'M SEEKING
A $40,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 25% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
NOW FOR CENTURIES,
THE COMMON HOUSE BROOM
HAS BEEN A TRUSTED TOOL TO HELP
PEOPLE CLEAN THEIR FLOORS,
BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN GOOD FOR ONE
THING, AND THAT'S SWEEPING.
AND IT FALLS SHORT WHEN IT COMES
TO SOLVING THE COMMON PROBLEM
THAT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD
HAS??
HOW DO YOU GET RID OF THINGS
THAT ARE STUCK ON YOUR FLOORS
THAT JUST WON'T COME UP?
WELL, THAT PROBLEM HAS NOW BEEN
SOLVED, BECAUSE WITH MY PRODUCT,
THE SweepEasy
SCRAPE AND GO BROOM,
YOU NOT ONLY HAVE A GREAT BROOM,
BUT WITH THE PUSH OF A HANDLE,
NOW YOU'VE GOT
A BUILT?IN SCRAPER.
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT
WHEN SOMEONE COMES ACROSS
SOMETHING LIKE
THIS DRIED?UP OATMEAL OR YOGURT
OR CEREAL ON THE FLOOR,
YOU SIMPLY SCRAPE, SWEEP,
AND GO.
YOU HAVE DRIED?UP SPAGHETTI
OR MAC AND CHEESE,
ELIMINATE IT WITH EASE.
SIMPLY SCRAPE, SWEEP, AND GO.
SHANE,
YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THAT?
I DO. IT'S PATENT PENDING
RIGHT NOW.
SHANE, WHERE ARE YOU
SELLING THIS CURRENTLY?
I'M NOT CUR??CERT??
CURRENTLY SELLING IT.
I HAVEN'T SOLD ANY YET,
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
I'M WORKING WITH PROTOTYPES.
THESE ARE PROTOTYPES
THAT I MADE MYSELF.
WHERE DID THIS HIT YOU?
DID YOU HAVE A DREAM
ABOUT SCRAPING CRAP
OFF THE FLOOR?
I BECAME A STAY?AT?HOME DAD
NOT TOO LONG AGO,
AND I FOUND THAT IS
ONE TOUGH JOB.
THANKS TO MY THREE KIDS
AND MY MOTHER?IN?LAW,
I WAS ALWAYS FINDING THIS
ON THE FLOOR??BAND?AIDS,
STICKERS, TAPE, GLUE,
YOU NAME IT.
AND ONE DAY I WAS
AT MY HANDS AND KNEES,
AND I'M, LIKE, SCRAPING UP
OATMEAL WITH A BUTTER KNIFE.
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
SHANE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY
TO GET RID OF THIS. AND BAM!
SHANE, CAN I TRY?
SO LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.
ROBERT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH.
I WANT TO HAVE YOU COME DOWN
BECAUSE YOU'RE
MY WIFE'S FAVORITE.
SHE LIKES YOUR EYES.
YOU KNOW, SHANE,
I'M THE ONLY GUY HERE
WHO HAS ACTUALLY EVER SWEPT
A FLOOR, I BET.
I WAS A STAY?AT?HOME DAD
FOR THREE YEARS.
THERE YOU GO. LOOK AT
THAT MACARONI AND CHEESE.
DISAPPEARS WITH EASE.
SEAN, HAVE YOU SHOWN THIS
TO ANY RETAILERS?
I HAVE.
AND WHAT RESPONSE DID YOU GET?
I'VE HEARD THINGS LIKE "MARKET
MOVER," AND??AND THE FACT
THAT IT BLOWS PEOPLE AWAY.
I'VE TALKED WITH
ONE OF THE NATION'S
LARGEST
JANITORIAL SUPPLIES COMPANIES,
AND THEIR QUESTION TO ME WASN'T
WHETHER OR NOT I HAD A PRODUCT.
THEY SAID, "SHANE, <i>WHEN</i> CAN YOU
HAVE A FINISHED PRODUCT?"
DID THEY GIVE YOU
A PURCHASE ORDER?
THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME
A PURCHASE ORDER YET
BECAUSE I'M NOT LICENSED,
BONDED, INSURED.
I'M A??I'M JUST
A ONE?MAN COMPANY RIGHT NOW.
I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOUR VISION
FOR THIS BUSINESS.
OKAY.
ARE WE GONNA MAKE BROOMS
AND START SELLING 'EM
TO ALL KINDS OF STORES
OR ARE WE GONNA GO AND TRY TO GO
TO BIG BROOM COMPANIES
AND SELL THEM OUR BROOMS
SO THEY CAN MAKE IT?
EXACTLY. ALL THE ABOVE.
BUT, SHANE, WHY CAN'T WE GO TO
PEOPLE WHO ALREADY MAKE BROOMS
AND GET 'EM TO SIMPLY USE THIS
WITHIN THEIR PRODUCTS?
(Daymond) YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A LICENSE?
YEAH.
WELL,
I THOUGHT OF LICENSING.
WELL, I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT,
ROBERT, YOU CAN DO THAT,
BUT THE REAL MONEY??IF YOU CAN
SELL IT DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER,
YOU COULD BUILD
$100 MILLION?DOLLAR BUSINESS.
(O'Leary) ON A SINGLE PRODUCT?
OH, SURE.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO RETAIL THIS AT?
I'D BEAT THE PAVEMENT
AT RESTAURANTS, MOVIE THEATERS,
HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS??EVERYWHERE
I'VE GONE, AND I'LL ASK THEM,
"WHAT WOULD YOU PAY
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?"
AND THE ANSWER IS
ALWAYS THE SAME??$19.95.
THAT'S WONDERFUL. LET'S TALK
ABOUT MONEY, MY FRIEND.
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE BUSINESS
OF MANUFACTURING BROOMS
WHEN I CAN GO AND GET THAT
DISTRIBUTION ALL OVER THE WORLD
AND JUST SIT THERE
AND COLLECT THE CHECK.
THAT'S MY IDEA
OF A GREAT BUSINESS,
AND I'D LIKE TO DO THAT WITH
YOU. I'M GONNA START RIGHT NOW.
$40,000 FOR 20%??
YOU GOT IT, KID.
(Harrington) I WOULDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT OFFER YET.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT JUST
LICENSING THIS PRODUCT, OKAY?
THAT'S ABOUT 30% TO 40%
OF THE INCOME THAT YOU CAN MAKE
AT THE END OF THE DAY
ON THIS PRODUCT.
I THINK YOU NEED TO EXPLORE
NOT ONLY LICENSING,
BUT DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER,
OKAY, AND THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE,
AND I THINK, UM,
I AM INTERESTED.
OKAY, $50,000 FOR 20%.
$50,000 FOR 20%.
STOP LISTENING TO THESE GUYS,
'CAUSE BY THE WAY, I COULD GET
ANOTHER TELEVISION GUY.
WE DON'T NEED THIS
TELEVISION??TELEVISION GUY.
THERE'S LOTS OF TELEVISION GUYS.
I'M THE BEST, THOUGH.
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW
THE STRATEGY THAT'S GONNA
MAKE YOU FILTHY RICH.
AND TO DO THAT, WE'RE GOING
TO A LICENSE STRATEGY.
SO I'M STARTING YOU RIGHT NOW.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $50,000
FOR 20% 'CAUSE I'M NOT GREEDY.
A SMALL PIECE FOR ME, I'M HAPPY.
I'LL MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR YOU.
A COUPLE OF PHONE CALLS,
WE'RE DONE.
SHANE, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT
LICENSING THIS
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
I DO THAT, TOO. OKAY?
WHAT I DO THOUGH IS, FIRST I DO
THE TV COMMERCIAL HERE.
THEN WE LICENSE <i>THAT</i>
ALL OVER THE WORLD, OKAY?
SO IT'S A LOT EASIER
TO MAKE THAT PHONE CALL
TO INDIA AND TO BRAZIL
WHEN WE HAVE A TV COMMERCIAL
THAT HAS WORKED HERE
IN THE U. S.
THAT WE CAN THEN GIVE TO THEM TO
ROLL OUT IN THAT LOCAL MARKET.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK??I THINK
THE BIGGER PROBLEM HERE, SHANE,
IS THAT YOU WANT TO RUN
YOUR OWN COMPANY. CORRECT?
SURE. WITH??WITH...
'CAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANT
TO MAKE PRODUCT.
WITH SOMEONE WITH SOME BUSINESS
SAVVY LIKE YOURSELVES.
LIKE??LIKE, ME, YES.
L?LIKE YOU.
BUT YOU WANT TO RUN
YOUR OWN COMPANY
AND POTENTIALLY GROW SweepEasy,
COME UP WITH OTHER PATENTS,
AND HAVE A COMPANY.
DAYMOND, CLOTHING GUY??WHAT DO
YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?
WELL, HERE'S WHAT
I HAVE TO DO WITH IT??
WHETHER YOU LIKE FUBU OR NOT,
I CREATED IT IN THE BASEMENT,
AND EVERYBODY
ON THE DAMN PLANET KNOWS IT.
THAT'S EVERYBODY'S STORY HERE.
EVERYBODY HAS THAT STORY.
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU DID.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I HAVE BRANDED A STINKING
PAIR OF JEANS GLOBALLY,
AND I WILL DO THAT
WITH THE BROOM.
YOU SEE, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
THE BROOM AND THE CLOTHING HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER.
YOU SEE? HE'S NOT
EVEN LETTING ME SPEAK.
IMAGINE WHAT
HE'S GONNA DO TO YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING
TO THE TABLE, DAYMOND?
I'M BRINGING $75,000.
FOR WHAT?
I'M BRINGING $75,000 FOR 33%,
BUT WE'LL CREATE
AN ENTIRE COMPANY.
FOR THE RECORD,
I'M DEFINITELY OUT.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY.
'CAUSE I DON'T SEE YOU
AS THE KIND OF GUY
WHO COULD GO THROUGH
A FINISH LINE, HONEST TO GOD.
(Harrington) I'M GONNA
GIVE AN OFFER.
YOU CAME IN ASKING
FOR $40,000, 25%.
I'M GONNA BUMP YOUR $40,000
A LITTLE BIT,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GO TO $75,000
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,
MY $50,000 OFFER FOR 25%
IS GONNA BE YOUR BEST DEAL.
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA MAKE
MILLIONS MORE OVER TIME,
BECAUSE THIS HAS TO GO ON
TELEVISION, AND YOU KNOW THAT.
DO YOU AGREE WITH ME?
I AGREE THAT IT HAS
TO GO ON TELEVISION.
OKAY, SO WE GOTTA START
WITH TV??
BUT YOU NEED A LICENSE
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU DEFINITELY NEED THIS BROOM.
THIS BROOM SPEAKS
EVERY LANGUAGE ON EARTH.
SURE.
EVERY KID SPILLS CRAP ON
THE FLOOR ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
SO LET'S THINK BIG. YOU NEED ME
TO THINK BIG. STOP THINKING SO??
SHANE, REMEMBER
WHO'S SAYING THIS TO YOU.
BARBARA, IF YOU??BARBARA.
THIS GUY'S A SHARK.
THEY ALL ARE.
YOU BETTER SLOW DOWN AND THINK.
YOU'RE A NICE GUY.
LET ME FINISH WITH THIS??
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WAR
WITH YOU, MY FRIEND. YOU BRING
SOME VALUE TO THE TABLE,
AND YOU'RE THE TV GUY I DO KNOW.
LET'S GO 50/50. LET'S GO??
GO AND CALL YOUR WIFE.
BARBARA,
IF YOU SCREW THIS UP FOR ME,
I'M GONNA SPANK YOU
LIKE A BABY SEAL.
NOW LISTEN, LET'S GET BACK
TO BUSINESS HERE. 50/50, KEVIN.
LET'S STOP FIGHTING 'CAUSE
I'M GONNA WIN THIS FIGHT
IF WE START IT.
YOU KNOW, KEVIN,
I?I RESPECT YOU,
BUT THIS IS A PRODUCT I WANT
TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL,
BECAUSE SEE, I WANT TO PUT HIM
AS THE FACE OF THIS PRODUCT.
DON'T LET
THAT VANITY THING WORK.
DON'T LET THAT WORK ON YOU.
YOU??NO. YOU'RE GONNA BE THE GUY
ON THE SHOPPING CHANNELS.
YOU'RE GONNA??YOUR FACE
COULD BE ON THE BOX,
SELLING THIS PRODUCT.
YOU CAN DO GREAT.
UGH, THAT'S SO HOLLYWOOD.
DON'T LET HIM PLAY THAT CARD.
(laughs)
I DON'T NEED ANY PARTNERS
ON THIS DEAL, OKAY?
SHANE, I'M WITH KEVIN. I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE MONEY.
I'D LIKE TO COME IN
ON THE LICENSING DEAL,
'CAUSE I THINK THAT IS THE ONLY
ROUTE THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.
I'LL PUT UP ANOTHER $40,000
FOR THAT SAME 20%.
$80,000 FOR 20%?
YEAH.
LET'S LIFT IT TO 25%.
OKAY. SO $80,000 FOR 25%,
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH.
LIFE IS VERY SIMPLE.
TWO GUYS WANT TO BUILD BROOMS.
TWO GUYS WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
SHANE, SHANE, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE
UNDERSTAND PRODUCT, AND WE WILL
GET ALSO LICENSING ONCE
WE GET TO A COMFORTABLE LEVEL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
LET'S DO SOMETHING.
$80,000
FOR 25% OF THE COMPANY?
CORRECT.
$80,000, 25% OF THE COMPANY.
HE DOES THE INFOMERCIALS,
I DO PRODUCT TO STORES,
WE HELP BUILD A BRAND ITSELF.
SHANE, I WANT??
I WANT AN ANSWER.
I'M GONNA CALL MY WIFE.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR WIFE.
YOU WANT TO TALK TO MY WIFE?
YEAH. GET HER ON THE PHONE.
I WANT TO TALK TO HER.
I'M ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO WEARS
THE PANTS IN THE FAMILY,
AND SHE'LL TELL YOU THAT.
I GET THAT, BUT I'M NOT??
I'M NOT SURE??
YOU SEE HOW
HE'S INSULTING YOU ALREADY?
JUST PULL THE CORD
ON THESE TWO GUYS.
SHANE, I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE
A DECISION RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW...
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY
DIFFERENT TO MY WIFE?
LET'S??I WANT TO TALK TO HER.
WELL...
LET'S TALK TO HER.
YOU KNOW, TALK IS CHEAP.
THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT IT. LET'S TALK.
(Daymond) SHANE, LISTEN.
I'M STARTING...
WE HAVE ANOTHER MINUTE. SHANE,
LET'S HAVE A MINUTE. SILENCE.
ONE SECOND, KEVIN.
I'M STARTING TO RECONSIDER.
I?I MAY RECONSIDER THE OFFER.
YOU KNOW WHY HE'S WORRIED?
BECAUSE IN THE BACK
OF YOUR MIND, SEAN...
AND SCRAPE HIM OFF OF THAT THING
RIGHT THERE RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING HERE. YOU KNOW THERE'S
SOMETHING HERE IN THIS LICENSE
DEAL YOU SHOULD CONSIDER.
IT'S A MUCH BIGGER VISION,
YOU BECOME MUCH WEALTHIER,
AND IT HAPPENS FASTER.
KEVIN, YOU'RE REALLY
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.
STAY HERE. I'LL BE BACK
TO YOU IN A MINUTE.
HE WALKS OUT, I'M WITHDRAWING.
(Robert) SHANE, BE A MAN,
FOR GODS SAKE.
OKAY, WELL, SURE.
I?I'M NEGOTIATING, ROBERT.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING.
I'M TRYING TO FIND WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY FAMILY AND FOR ME, SO...
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM, BUT I'VE
JUST REDUCED MY $40,000 TO??
LISTEN. I'VE JUST REDUCED
MY $40,000 TO $30,000,
SO NOW MY DEAL IS $70,000.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RETAIN
THAT OFFER, AND I??
IF YOU WILL GO BACK
TO YOUR ORIGINAL OFFER,
I'M GONNA??I'M GONNA SAY
THAT I WANNA WORK WITH YOU.
RIGHT NOW?
YES.
(O'Leary) ALL RIGHT.
NOW I'M IN FOR THE $80,000
WITH YOU, DAYMOND.
RIGHT??I'M GONNA??
LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW. DEAL.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
GOOD JOB.
(Barbara) GOOD DECISION.
THANK YOU, MAN.
(Shane) I KNEW YOU WERE THE MAN.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
DEAD MAN SWEEPING.
(laughs)
MAYBE WE LET THEM HAVE CANADA.
NO, WE'LL SEND 'EM SOME BROOMS.
WE'LL SEND 'EM SOME BROOMS.
TO HAVE THEM BE THAT EXCITED
ABOUT MY PRODUCT, IT FELT GOOD,
AND I'LL??IT'LL ALLOW MY WIFE
TO STAY HOME WITH THE KIDS.
SO FOR THAT, I AM
TRULY BLESSED AND EXCITED.
