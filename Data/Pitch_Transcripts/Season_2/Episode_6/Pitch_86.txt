I'M KIM NELSON, I'M FROM
SPARTANBURG, SOUTH CAROLINA,
AND MY COMPANY IS DAISY CAKES.
MY CAKES ARE
MY GREAT AUNT DAISY'S
AND MY GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPES,
PASSED DOWN BY GENERATIONS
OF ALL THE WOMEN IN OUR FAMILY.
WE USE ONLY FRESH,
NATURAL INGREDIENTS,
AND THERE'S LOTS
OF SOUTHERN LOVE IN EVERY BITE.
WE PACKAGE 'EM
IN THESE BEAUTIFUL TINS,
AND WE SHIP THEM NATIONWIDE,
RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR.
(horn honks)
HEY!
THANK YOU.
MY MAMA GERALDINE AND I
BAKE EVERY SINGLE CAKE
THAT COMES OUT OF THAT KITCHEN,
AND WE ARE
TWO OF THE HARDEST WORKING WOMEN
YOU WILL EVER MEET,
BUT WE NEED SOME HELP. WE CANNOT
CONTINUE TO MEET THE DEMAND.
MY FAMILY'S INVESTED $93,000
IN THIS BUSINESS,
AND THERE'S NO MORE MONEY
TO PUT IN,
SO I REALLY NEED HELP
FROM THE SHARKS.
I NEED AN INVESTMENT.
I PUT SO MUCH LOVE AND SO MUCH
PASSION INTO THE CAKES I MAKE,
AND I HOPE
THEY WILL SEE THAT
AND THAT THEY'LL WANT
A PIECE OF IT.
MY NAME IS KIM NELSON,
AND I'M FORM SPARTANBURG,
SOUTH CAROLINA,
AND MY COMPANY IS DAISY CAKES.
I'M ASKING FOR $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
MY DAISY CAKES ARE
<i>THE</i> BEST CAKES
THAT YOU WILL EVER PUT
IN YOUR MOUTH.
THEY ARE MY FAMILY RECIPES.
THEY ARE MADE FROM SCRATCH.
WE DON'T USE ANY PRESERVATIVES,
ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS IN OUR CAKES.
AND THE BEST PART??
WE DELIVER THEM TO YOU.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO TASTE THEM.
MMM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE CHOCOLATE.
OH, OKAY.
OH, WOW.
(Robert) WOW, IS THAT EVER GOOD.
THAT LOOKS VERY GOOD.
WOW!
(Harrington) MMM.
SO THE CARROT CAKE??
MY NUMBER ONE SELLER.
FANTASTIC, BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU. WE PUT A WHOLE POUND
OF CARROTS IN EVERY CAKE...
MMM.
ALSO SOME GOLDEN RAISINS
AND JUST A HINT OF CINNAMON...
(Barbara) MMM.
AND THEN A DELICIOUS
CREAM CHEESE ICING.
RED VELVET CAKE??
THE SOUTHERN HOLIDAY TRADITION.
OF COURSE.
AND THEN KEVIN,
YOU HAD THE LEMON BURST.
(Harrington) LEMON.
THAT'S MY NEWEST CAKE,
AND IT'S CREAM CHEESE ICING.
BUT IT HAS
A FRESH LEMON CURD IN IT.
SO WE HAND ZEST
AND JUICE THE LEMONS,
WE USE CAGE?FREE EGGS
AND SUGAR??THAT'S IT.
HOW DO YOU GET 'EM OUT
TO THE CUSTOMERS?
SO YOU WOULD CALL ME
OR GO ON MY WEB SITE,
AND THEN I SHIP THEM NATIONWIDE.
AND, UH, WE PACK 'EM WITH
DRY ICE, SO THEY'RE FROZEN.
AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE IT OUT
AND ENJOY A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME
IF YOU WANT TO, OR YOU CAN HAVE
THE WHOLE CAKE AT ONCE
IF YOU NEED IT FOR AN EVENT.
WHAT DO YOU SELL
THESE CAKES FOR?
UM, ONLINE THEY'RE $44.50.
SO THEY'RE PRETTY PRICY.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?
$18.
HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED
IN THE CAKE BUSINESS?
WELL, HONESTLY, IT IS??IT IS
MY GOD?GIVEN TALENT
FROM HAVING, UM, DONE CATERING
AND TAUGHT COOKING CLASSES.
SO I DECIDED TO JUST START
THE COMPANY, AND...
SO, KIM,
THE CAKES ARE FANTASTIC.
BEST CAKES I'VE TASTED. UH...
(Barbara) BEST CAKE
I'VE EVER HAD, REALLY.
(Robert) YEAH.
THANK YOU.
HEY, KIM, BUT HOW DO YOU??
HOW DO YOU GET THE CUSTOMERS?
WELL, THE BEST WAY TO GET
THE CUSTOMERS IS TO GO
TO THE SHOWS. YOU HAVE A BOOTH,
AND THEY GET TO COME BY.
MY MOTHER CUTS EVERY ONE OF THEM
INTO THESE LITTLE TINY SQUARES
SO THAT YOU COME BY AND YOU GET
TO HAVE IT ON A TOOTHPICK.
WHAT TYPE OF SHOW
ARE YOU SPEAKING ABOUT?
OH, LIKE JUNIOR LEAGUE SHOWS.
THEIR HOLIDAY SHOWS.
LIKE FOR LITTLE COMMUNITIES?
(Daymond) SO THIS IS
TO GET DISTRIBUTORS?
UM, OH, NO. NOT, UH??MNH?MNH.
NOT A WHOLESALE.
THIS IS, UM, LIKE FUND?RAISERS,
LIKE JUNIOR LEAGUE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WE JUST FINISHED OUR FIRST YEAR,
AND OUR SALES HAVE BEEN GREAT
WITH PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH,
WHERE WE'VE GONE.
WE NEED A NUMBER, KIM.
HOW MUCH HAVE
YOUR SALES BEEN?
UM, THE THREE MONTHS
OF OCTOBER, NOVEMBER,
AND DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR??
$27??$27,000.
A LITTLE OVER $27,000.
IN 3 MONTHS?
IN THREE MONTHS, YES.
AND HOW MANY SHOWS DID
YOU AND YOUR MOM ATTEND
TO SELL THAT?
THREE.
THREE. IN YOUR LOCAL AREA?
WELL, NO.
I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA,
BUT WE WENT TO, UM, BATON ROUGE
AND LAFAYETTE, LOUISIANA,
AND THEN TO HOUSTON, TEXAS.
SO SHORT OF PUTTING YOU
AND YOUR MOM IN A CAR
WITH A BUNCH OF CAKES
AND TRAVELING THE COUNTRY...
RIGHT.
HOW ARE WE GONNA SELL THESE?
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE
TO GET ON, UM,
ONE OF THE SHOPPING NETWORKS.
OKAY, LET'S JUST SAY THAT
FOR A SECOND.
LET'S SAY I PUT YOU
ON THE SHOPPING NETWORK??
I CAN DO THAT??AND I GET YOU
100,000 ORDERS FOR CAKES.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
KILL YOUR MOTHER TO MAKE THEM?
HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?
WELL, WE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE DIFFERENT, UM,
WAY OF BAKING.
WHERE DO YOU MAKE 'EM NOW?
WE??I HAVE
A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN.
WELL, COULD YOU MAKE 5,000
IN A WEEK?
OR WHAT KIND OF QUANTITIES
CAN YOU HANDLE?
I CAN MAKE 5,000 IN 30 DAYS.
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE PERSONALLY
ENGAGED THE CONSUMER,
YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY SALES
TO A GROCERY STORE...
MM?HMM. LET ME TELL YOU.
SOMEBODY WHO HAS NO IDEA
WHO YOU ARE??
YOU HAVE NOT MADE SALES
IN THAT AREA YET?
UM, OKAY,
SO THIS IS MY LEMON CURD.
I'M IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING
MY LEMON CURD PICKED UP
TO BE CARRIED AT WHOLE FOODS.
OKAY.
AND HOW ARE YOU GONNA PRODUCE
ENOUGH QUANTITY FOR THEM,
ASSUMING THEY DO A ROLL?OUT
ACROSS THE COUNTRY?
UM, I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.
HEY, KIM...
YES.
I GET DOZENS AND DOZENS OF
CATALOGS, UH, A MONTH, AND I SEE
SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE SELLING
THIS KIND OF PRODUCT??CAKES
AND PIES AND??AND CHEESECAKES
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF,
SO IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE.
IF YOU CAN GET THAT PRODUCT
IN THEIR MOUTHS AND LET THEM
TASTE IT OR GET, YOU KNOW,
GET SOMEBODY LIKE YOU
TO SAY HOW GOOD IT IS??
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
A VERY SMALL REGIONAL STRATEGY
THAT'S WORKING FOR YOU.
MM?HMM.
I MEAN, $27,000
IN 3 MONTHS ISN'T BAD.
WHY CAN'T YOU AND YOUR MOM
HOP IN THE CAR, TAKE THE CAKES??
I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE
YOUR MOM'S RECIPES.
MY??THEY'RE MY??ACTUALLY,
YEAH, FAMILY RECIPES.
MY GRANDMOTHER'S.
DAISY WAS MY GREAT AUNT.
WHY CAN'T YOU CONTINUE
TO DO THAT?
JUST GO TO THESE TRADE SHOWS
AND SELL THEM THAT WAY.
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO BE
A HUGE BUSINESS.
I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
HOW FABULOUS MY CAKES ARE.
WHEN THEY THINK OF ORDERING
SOMETHING, THEY DON'T WANT
TO ORDER FLOWERS, THEY DON'T
WANT TO ORDER FRUIT.
THEY'RE THINKING, OH, MY GOSH.
I'M SENDING A CAKE.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM. THE??THEY
ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER TRIED,
BUT TO TURN THAT INTO A BUSINESS
IS A HUGE CHALLENGE,
AND ONE THAT I'M NOT PREPARED
TO TAKE. I'M OUT.
(whispers) OKAY.
KIM, I SEE THIS
AS A WORD?OF?MOUTH TYPE
OF BUSINESS,
AND I LOOK FOR FAST GROWTH.
THANK YOU FOR A GREAT
EXPERIENCE, UH, TASTEWISE,
BUT I'M OUT TODAY.
SO 85% OF BUSINESSES IN AMERICA
ARE SMALL BUSINESSES
THAT DO NOTHING BUT PROVIDE
A LIVING FOR THE OWNER,
BUT THAT'S NOT
AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS.
I WISH YOU ALL THE SUCCESS.
I WILL BE A CUSTOMER,
BUT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
TO INVEST IN TODAY. I'M OUT.
(mouths word)
KIM, I THINK THE BUSINESS IS
TOO SMALL FOR ME, SO I'M OUT.
EVERYBODY'S OUT HERE
EXCEPT BARBARA.
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING,
BARBARA?
I LIKE <i>YOU</i> VERY MUCH.
I THINK IT'S TOO SMALL
A BUSINESS,
QUITE HONESTLY, TO INVEST IN.
(mouths word)
HOWEVER...
I NOTICED WHEN YOU PASSED
YOUR DELICIOUS CAKE AROUND,
EVERY GUY HERE ATE
MORE THAN 50% AND??
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT, BARBARA.
BUT AFTER EACH OF THESE GUYS
DROPPED OUT,
