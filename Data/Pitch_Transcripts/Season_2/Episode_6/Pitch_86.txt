HEY.
MY NAME IS DEIDREA HAYSEL.
ALL THE BLANKETS ARE MADE SO??
DEIDREA, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A REAL JOB?
I SELL DRUGS FOR A LIVING??
THE LEGAL ONES.
I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL SALES REP.
I BET YOU DO
A GOOD JOB DOING THAT.
THANKS.
UM, I LIKE THIS DEAL,
I LIKE THE ENTHUSIASM,
BUT THOSE ARE BASIC INGREDIENTS
FOR ANY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
LET'S FOCUS
ON HOW THIS BUSINESS GROWS.
ABSOLUTELY.
DEIDREA, YOU DIDN'T GIVE US
YOUR PRICE ON THIS.
MY PRICE POINT IS
A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH.
WHY? BECAUSE I'M MANUFACTURING
IN SMALL QUANTITIES.
NOBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE,
DEIDREA.
HOW DO YOU KNOW? THEY DO.
BRING IT UP!
DEIDREA, YOU'RE??YOU'RE
A FANTASTIC SALES REP,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S MISSING WITH YOU.
THANK YOU. BRING IT.
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING HOW YOU'RE
GONNA GROW, HOW YOU'RE
GONNA ADVERTISE??YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THOSE COSTS.
OF COURSE I DO.
WELL, DEIDREA, HOW COULD YOU?
HOW COULD $30,000 PUT YOU
DEIDREA?
(normal voice) YES.
I HAVE TO SAY, I CAN'T GET OVER
THE PART?TIME SITUATION.
THIS IS ALWAYS
GONNA BE MY HUSTLE.
I'M GONNA SAY I'M OUT.
SO IT'S??IT'S BAD
THAT I HAVE A JOB?
IS THAT??IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
THE BUSINESS IS NOT
GENERATING ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO PAY
FULL?TIME ATTENTION,
SO WHY SHOULD HIS MONEY
PAY FULL?TIME ATTENTION?
YEAH. IT'S TOO RISKY FOR ME.
THANK YOU.
THAT LEAVES ME.
HI, BARBARA.
OH, DON'T GIVE ME
THAT LITTLE GIRL LOOK.
(laughs)
I'M OKAY WITH WHAT YOU SOLD
SO FAR WITH NO ADVERTISING,
BUT I AM VERY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU AS A PARTNER.
SO??SO YOU MAKING AN OFFER
OUT OF ALL THIS?
BARBARA, I FORBID YOU
TO INVEST IN THIS BUSINESS.
I'M TIRED OF YOU KILLING MONEY.
DEIDREA, LET ME PUT THIS
TO THE TEST, ALL RIGHT?
I'D BE INTERESTED
IN BUYING INTO YOUR BUSINESS.
(O'Leary)
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S CRYING?
NO, NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.
BUT I AM CONCERNED, AGAIN,
ABOUT YOUR OPEN?MINDEDNESS,
SO LET ME PUT WHAT THE PIECES
ARE ON THE TABLE.
ONE, I WOULD WANT YOU
TO BE TOTALLY OPEN
TO MAKING A CHEAPER GOWN...
I'M TOTALLY OPEN TO IT.
TOTALLY OPEN
TO MAYBE EVEN A BAG...
ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE PEOPLE
REQUEST THOSE.
I THINK WE'RE ALL OUT, DEIDREA.
OKAY. (sighs) THANKS, GUYS.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
SORRY FOR THE TEARS.
HUGE MISTAKE TO TURN THAT OFFER
DOWN, IN MY OPINION.
IT'S REALLY A SHAME THOUGH,
BECAUSE I COULD'VE
MADE THAT BUSINESS FLY.
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.
I TURNED DOWN BARBARA BECAUSE
SHE HAD TOO MANY CONDITIONS
