I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BENEFIT
OF THAT WOULD BE.
JUST FOR PRICE REASONS,
YOU WOULD SAY, TO GO ONE SIZE?
FOR PRICE REASONS, IT WOULD
MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE.
I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT,
BECAUSE TO ME,
WHEN I THINK
"ONE SIZE FITS ALL,"
I THINK OF THE GOWN
THAT HER BOTTOM'S EXPOSED.
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID,
I'M SERVICING WOMEN
THAT ARE 2 TO 24, AND A 24?SIZE
WOMAN??THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
LICENSING THIS IDEA
TO THE GOWN COMPANIES?
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT,
BECAUSE THEY'RE LITERALLY
DOING THEM FOR 25 CENTS A GOWN,
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA SEE??THEY
WANT A ONE?SIZE?FITS?ALL GOWN.
HERE'S THE ISSUE??YOU KNOW,
IT'S WHAT YOU THINK
THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW
THAT WILL PREVENT YOU
FROM LEARNING.
IT'S TOO HIGH?END.
I UNDERSTAND.
BUT YOU HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS,
SO YOU'LL NEVER LEARN FROM ME.
SO WITH THAT, I'M OUT.
THE PROBLEM I HAVE??YOU WANT
YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT, TOO,
BECAUSE YOU'RE PART?TIME,
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME
TO PUT MY FULL?TIME MONEY
INTO THIS DEAL.
I'M NOT, THOUGH.
IT'LL MAKE ME FULL?TIME.
LIKE I SAID, I'M AMAZING. LIKE
I SAID, I COULD BE DANGEROUS...
AND SO HUMBLE.
IF I DO THIS. I'M A HOT MAMA.
I'M A HOT??YEAH, SUPER WIFE.
MY HUSBAND'S GONE
MONDAY TO FRIDAY,
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY
THAT DOES EVERYTHING WITH
A 4 YEAR OLD AND 2 YEAR OLD,
WORKS A 40?HOUR A WEEK JOB,
AND HUSTLES HER SIDE BUSINESS.
YOU CAN'T TAKE "NO" AS AN ANSWER
WHICH IS GREAT AS A SALES REP,
BUT YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING ANY
OF THE INVESTMENT QUESTIONS.
YOU'RE TOO SMALL.
LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR
AND MATURE TO A POINT WHERE
YOU CAN BE A BUSINESS OWNER,
NOT JUST A GREAT SALES REP.
I'M OUT.
(whispers) THANKS, ROBERT.
IT HAS TO BE MUTUALLY
BENEFICIAL, AND IT'S??
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID NO.
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL.
BARBARA, YOU GOT CAUGHT.
NO, IT'S NOT A DIG
AGAINST HER AT ALL.
I?I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU BRING
TO THE TABLE.
I'M OUT.
(mouths word)
(exhales deeply) HELLO.
MY NAME IS BEN FOSSEY.
AND I'M MELISSA FOSSEY,
AND MY COMPANY IS CADDYSWAG.
WE'RE HERE TODAY
TO ASK FOR $60,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20%
OF OUR COMPANY.
NOW AS WE ALL KNOW, THERE'S TWO
TYPES OF GOLFERS IN THIS WORLD.
THERE'S THE SERIOUS GOLFER
AND THEN WHAT WE CALL
THE CADDYSWAG GOLFER.
THE CADDYSWAG GOLFER IS
YOUR AVERAGE, EVERYDAY GOLFER
WHOSE SCORE IS SECONDARY
TO JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME
ON THE COURSE.
THAT'S WHY I INVENTED
THE PAR?6.
THE PAR?6 IS DESIGNED TO FIT
INSIDE THE SHOE POCKET
OF ANY GOLF BAG.
THE PAR?6 ALSO KEEPS
6 12?OUNCE CANS COLD
FOR 18 HOLES GUARANTEED,
WITHOUT ICE.
HOW? EACH COOLER COMES
WITH A CUSTOMIZED
REFREEZABLE GEL PACK
WHICH IS GUARANTEED
TO KEEP THE CANS COLD.
NOW NOT ONLY DOES
THIS PAR?6
PAY FOR ITSELF THE FIRST TIME
YOU USE IT, BUT IT CAN SAVE YOU
ANYWHERE FROM $20 TO $30
PER ROUND OF GOLF.
HOW? A GOLF COURSE SIX?PACK
WILL COST YOU ANYWHERE FROM
ABOUT $25 TO $35 PLUS TIP.
A SIX?PACK AT THE CORNER STORE
COSTS YOU ABOUT 5 OR 6 BUCKS.
SO BY KEEPING YOUR CANS COLD
WITH THE PAR?6,
YOU'VE JUST SAVED $20 TO $30.
AND IF YOU CALL TODAY,
YOU CAN GET YOUR PAR?6 COOLER
FOR JUST $19.99.
BUT WAIT.
ORDER IN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES,
AND WE'RE GONNA DOUBLE
YOUR ORDER??
2 PAR?6 COOLERS FOR $19.99,
PLUS SHIPPING AND HANDLING.
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.
NO, THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE IS MORE.
WE'VE MADE THE VERY FIRST EVER
"SHARK TANK" VERSION
OF THE PAR?6.
BEN, ARE THERE GOLF COURSES
THAT HAVE ANY RULES
ABOUT BEING ABLE
TO BRING YOUR OWN BEVERAGES?
THERE ARE SOME COURSES
THAT, YOU KNOW,
FROWN UPON YOU BRINGING
YOUR OWN ONTO THE COURSE,
BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT
OF GOLF COURSES OUT THERE
THAT DON'T PROVIDE
ANY TYPE OF BEVERAGE SERVICE
AT ALL WHATSOEVER.
INTERESTING IDEA.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES RIGHT NOW?
WE'RE AVERAGING
$15,000 IN SALES A YEAR
SINCE WE'VE STARTED SO FAR,
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT
THAT THAT'S
BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY.
WE HAVE NOT INVESTED ANY MONEY
INTO ADVERTISING AT THIS TIME.
JUST SO THAT I DON'T CLUTTER
THE SPACE
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO ARE
GOLF AFICIONADOS, I'M OUT.
I PLAY A LOT OF GOLF. THERE IS
NO GOLF COURSE OUT THERE
THAT'LL ALLOW YOU TO BRING YOUR
OWN BEVERAGE IN. YOU KNOW THAT.
I DISAGREE.
BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
CONSUMERS THAT ARE
CARRYING THEIR BEVERAGES
ON THE COURSE ALREADY.
AGREED. AND THEY USE??
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THAT CONSUMER
SIMPLY TAKING A SMALL COOLER
AND PUTTING IT
IN THE BACK OF THE GOLF CART?
WELL, BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE
ADVERTISING THAT YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN BEVERAGES
ON THE??ON THE GOLF CART.
WE'LL SHOW YOU WHAT OUR
CURRENT COMPETITION LOOKS LIKE,
AND THIS IS WHAT IT IS.
LIKE THIS.
AND IT'S A MESS. IT DOESN'T
STAY COLD FOR 18 HOLES.
IT LEAKS INSIDE THE??INSIDE
THE POCKET OF YOUR GOLF BAG.
THIS WILL NOT DO THAT.
BEN, IF I GAVE YOU THE $60,000,
WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR?
WE WOULD ORDER 10,000 UNITS
AT $3 APIECE.
WE'D TAKE THE REMAINDER
OF THE MONEY,
AND WE WOULD LOOK AT PUTTING
AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
TOGETHER IN TARGETED MARKETS,
TO BE ABLE
TO TURN THE PRODUCT OVER.
WE'RE SELLING 'EM RIGHT NOW
FOR 2 FOR $19.99.
THAT'S A PROFIT MARGIN
OF $13.99.
NOW I'M NO MATH MAJOR,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE AT $13.99,
YOU ONLY HAVE TO GET 71,500
ORDERS TO GROSS $1 MILLION.
THERE'S OVER 36 MILLION GOLFERS
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE.
BEN, I'M NO MATH MAJOR EITHER,
BUT $15,000 IN SALES PER YEAR
IS PRETTY CLOSE TO ZERO.
IT'S BASICALLY A COOLER BAG,
AND THERE'S A HUGE MARKET
OF DEVICES
THAT COOL ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
(Robert) YEAH.
MY KIDS HAVE COOLERS LIKE THIS
WITH EXACTLY THE SAME THING,
IN DIFFERENT SHAPES.
LIKE, I THINK IF SOMEONE IS
REALLY MOTIVATED TO BRING
BEVERAGES ONTO THE GOLF COURSE,
THEY REALLY DON'T NEED YOUR BAG.
THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT USES
THAT YOU CAN USE THIS FOR.
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER
THE PROMOTIONAL MARKET AS WELL.
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT IT?
WHAT'S PATENTABLE? WHAT'S??
WHAT MAKES THIS COOLER BETTER
THAN THE THOUSAND OTHER COOLERS
MY WIFE AND KIDS BUY?
ONE, WE'VE??WE'VE CHANGED
THE CORNER ON IT
WHERE THE ZIPPER ATTACHES
TO THE COOLER ITSELF,
TO PREVENT ANY LEAKING
IF YOU WERE TO USE IT FOR ICE,
AND THAT IS WHAT DOES
MAKE IT PATENTABLE.
BUT THERE ARE COOLERS THAT
DON'T NEED ICE. YOU KNOW THAT.
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT THEY'RE NOT SHAPED
IN THIS??THEY'RE NOT SHAPED
IN THIS FASHION.
SO AGAIN, THE??THE ONLY THING
THAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS IS
THE SHAPE OF THE COOLER?
AND THE CORNER, AS HE JUST
EXPLAINED??IT DOESN'T LEAK ICE.
AND THE FUNCTIONALITY. IT FITS
IN EVERY SINGLE GOLF BAG,
OR YOUR MONEY BACK.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
THE BEST PLACE TO ADVERTISE THIS
IS THE GOLF CHANNEL?
ABSOLUTELY.
OKAY, THEN I'M GONNA TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, ON THE GOLF CHANNEL,
MOST PRODUCTS ARE GONNA GIVE YOU
A LOWER SCORE.
RIGHT.
OKAY? THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT'S
KIND OF A FRIVOLOUS?TYPE PRODUCT
THAT IT, YOU KNOW, IT, TO ME, IT
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH PUNCH TO IT
TO REALLY GET THE PHONE
TO RING.
SO I'M OUT.
(Robert) I THINK
IT'S A TRIVIAL PRODUCT.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA SELL VERY MANY.
I THINK YOU HAVE
AN UPHILL BATTLE.
IT SOLVES A NEED...
YEAH.
IT PAYS FOR ITSELF
THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT,
AND IT SAVES GOLFERS MONEY
EVERY TIME MOVING FORWARD.
I'M OUT.
I THINK THERE IS A NEED
FOR THE PRODUCT.
I HAVE TWO BROTHERS,
BOTH ROOFERS,
THAT CONSISTENTLY SNEAK BEER
ONTO THE GOLF COURSE,
AND THEY PROBABLY NEED
FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE
'CAUSE THEY DRINK A TON.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
(Melissa) RIGHT.
BUT IT'S STILL A SMALL BUSINESS.
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF BUSINESS
THAT YOU GET AN INVESTOR
TO PUT THEIR MONEY IN,
'CAUSE YOU JUST COULDN'T GET
THE MONEY BACK OUT.
IT WOULD TAKE TOO DARN LONG.
SO I'M OUT.
YOU'RE MAKING SOMETHING
THAT ALREADY EXISTS ALREADY IN
A THOUSAND DIFFERENT ITERATIONS.
THERE'S NOTHING TO INVEST IN.
AND I'M VERY DEPRESSED NOW,
BECAUSE I KNOW WITH CERTAINTY
THERE'S NO CHANCE
THAT I CAN EVER MAKE ANY MONEY
WITH YOU.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION??
WHEN YOU GO OUT
ON THE GOLF COURSE, DO YOU WANNA
PAY $6 FOR A??FOR ONE COLD BEER
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE
TO GET A SIX?PACK?
(laughs)
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
I MEAN, HEY, L?LET'S FACE IT??
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE
THE MOST MONEY ARE THE ONES THAT
ARE WATCHING THE BOTTOM DOLLAR.
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DO NOT
WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY
THAT'S OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE??
BEN, SERIOUSLY, YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA CREATE
A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS
BY SAVING PEOPLE
A COUPLE OF BUCKS ON A BEER
WHEN THEY GO GOLFING?
I THINK THAT WE CAN SELL
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF THESE??OF THESE UNITS
AND MAKE MONEY ON IT AND MAKE
MONEY FOR YOU GUYS AS WELL.
I'M OUT.
WELL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
DO WE GET OUR COOLERS BACK THEN
SINCE YOU DON'T WANT 'EM?
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND LET YOU GUYS
KEEP PAYING FOR ALL
OF YOUR BEVERAGES ON THE COURSE.
GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK, MY MAN.
I'VE GOTTA GO MAKE
SOME MONEY ON THESE.
THANK YOU.
NICE MEETING YOU ALL.
WOW.
THAT WAS HORRIFIC. THAT WAS
AN ABSOLUTE HORRIFIC IDEA.
WHY??WHY DID YOU PISS HIM OFF?
HE TOOK AWAY MY COOLER.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN BUY ONE
FOR $19.95.
THAT WAS SUCH A BAD IDEA.
THOSE GUYS HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY.
I MEAN, THEY DON'T GET
WHAT THE AVERAGE CONSUMER'S
GOING THROUGH,
ESPECIALLY IN THIS ECONOMY.
PEOPLE WANT TO SAVE MONEY,
AND PEOPLE ARE SNEAKING BEER
ON THE COURSE.
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY.
THEY'VE BENT FORWARD, I NOTICED,
AND HAD ANOTHER BITE.
SO I'M GONNA TAKE A FLIER
ON THIS, BUT I AM WORRIED
ABOUT MY GETTING MY MONEY OUT
OF A TINY LITTLE BUSINESS,
SO HERE ARE THE TWO CONDITIONS??
FOR EVERY CAKE SOLD,
YOU MAIL ME $1.
SO BY THE TIME
YOU SELL 50,000 CAKES,
I'D HAVE MY MONEY BACK. OKAY?
YES, MA'AM.
AND SECONDLY, THAT YOU MAKE SURE
YOUR MOTHER'S ON YOUR TEAM
AND SHE'S GONNA BE HUSTLING
THESE CAKES AT EVERY TRADE SHOW,
AND THE MONEY'S GONNA BE USED
FOR TRADE SHOWS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
(exhales deeply) OF COURSE.
YES, MA'AM.
OOH!
GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU. (laughs)
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(laughs)
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(Robert) THANK YOU.
BYE.
YOU KNOW, BARBARA, YOU'RE
ONE CRAZY CHICK, YOU KNOW?
I'M NOT AT ALL.
I'M GONNA GET MY MONEY BACK.
THIS GIRL'S A HUSTLER.
YOU KNOW WHO SHE REMINDS ME OF?
MY ELEPHANT LADY.
SHE CAME THROUGH 150%, AND SHE'S
CUT OUT OF THE SAME CLOTH.
EVERY CAKE I SELL,
I'M GONNA BE THINKING OF BARBARA
AND THANKING BARBARA,
BECAUSE SHE HAS MADE ALL THIS
REALLY, REALLY COME TO FRUITION,
AND IT IS GONNA MAKE
SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE
BECAUSE MY BUSINESS IS
GOING TO SKYROCKET.
