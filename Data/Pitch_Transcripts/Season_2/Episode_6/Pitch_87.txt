HEY.
MY NAME IS DEIDREA HAYSEL.
MY COMPANY IS HOT MAMA GOWNS,
AND I'M SEEKING $30,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN I GAVE
BIRTH TO MY FIRST CHILD,
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL DAY OF MY LIFE,
BUT INSTEAD,
I HAVE TERRIBLE MEMORIES
OF FEELING HUMILIATED
AND INSECURE,
ALL BECAUSE I WAS WEARING
A NASTY, CHEMICAL?SMELLING,
ILL?FITTING HOSPITAL GOWN
THAT LEFT MY BODY EXPOSED.
I ACTUALLY HAD TO WEAR
TWO GOWNS??ONE IN THE FRONT,
ONE IN THE BACK??TO SOMEWHAT
COVER MY BACKSIDE.
I SWORE ON THAT DAY
FOUR YEARS AGO,
THAT NO WOMAN SHOULD EVER HAVE
TO FEEL HUMILIATED LIKE I DID
ON SUCH A JOYOUS DAY
IN HER LIFE,
SO I DESIGNED HOT MAMA GOWNS.
THEY'RE MADE OF 100% ORGANIC
COTTON, THEY'RE SUPER SOFT,
THEY HAVE SHORT SLEEVES FOR
I. V. s AND BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKS,
THEY HAVE A FULL SNAP?DOWN BACK
TO KEEP MOM'S ASSETS COVERED,
AND THEY'RE DESIGNED
FOR BREAST?FEEDING.
HOT MAMA GOWNS ALLOW MOM
TO FEEL BEAUTIFUL, CELEBRATED,
AND CONFIDENT.
SHE IS NOT
AN ILL HOSPITAL PATIENT.
SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL,
PREGNANT MOTHER,
AND WHAT SHE'S WEARING
SHOULD REFLECT THAT JOY,
AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHY
I DESIGNED HOT MAMA GOWNS.
NOW GIVE ME YOUR MONEY, OKAY?
(chuckles)
WHO CARES HOW YOU LOOK?
YOU JUST HAD A BABY. IT'S??
IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW I LOOK.
IT'S??IT'S ABOUT ME
AND BEING HUMILIATED
AMONG THESE TOTAL STRANGERS.
HOW MANY, UH, WOMEN
HAVE A BABY EVERY YEAR?
THIS IS WHY IT'S SO EXCITING.
IT'S A $4.5 BILLION MARKET??
MATERNITY.
IT HAS EXPERIENCED 12% GROWTH
EVERY YEAR SINCE 2002.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
$11,500.
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
THAT'S FROM 2009
TO CURRENTLY.
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ASKING
FOR $30,000 FOR 20%,
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING YOUR
COMPANY IS WORTH $150,000?
ABSOLUTELY.
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
I'M NOT STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU
WITH A SILVER SPOON IN MY MOUTH.
I'VE BEEN WORKING
SINCE I WAS 13 YEARS OLD.
I HAVE A FULL?TIME JOB
WHILE I'M DOING THIS AT NIGHT,
AFTER THE KIDS GO TO BED, AFTER
I WORK MY 40?HOUR A WEEK JOB.
WE VALUATE COMPANIES
ACCORDINGLY
TO HOW MUCH SALES YOU HAVE.
THERE'S NO DEBT
ON THIS COMPANY.
I HAVE NO LOANS.
I'VE NEVER BORROWED MONEY.
EVERYTHING IS PAID FOR.
I'M SITTING ON ABOUT
$20,000 OF FABRIC,
ALL THE CUSTOM?MADE BOXES,
ALL THE BLANKETS ARE MADE SO??
DEIDREA, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A REAL JOB?
I SELL DRUGS FOR A LIVING??
THE LEGAL ONES.
I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL SALES REP.
I BET YOU DO
A GOOD JOB DOING THAT.
THANKS.
UM, I LIKE THIS DEAL,
I LIKE THE ENTHUSIASM,
BUT THOSE ARE BASIC INGREDIENTS
FOR ANY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
LET'S FOCUS
ON HOW THIS BUSINESS GROWS.
AND I SAY TO YOU,
GET ME 10% OF THAT MARKET
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.
HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?
EASY. THIS IS M??
THIS IS NO ADVERTISING.
NO ADVERTISING.
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.
PEOPLE ARE COMING TO ME.
I HAVE RETAILERS CALLING ME,
WANTING TO CARRY MY GOWNS.
OH, REALLY?
ABSOLUTELY.
DEIDREA, YOU DIDN'T GIVE US
YOUR PRICE ON THIS.
MY PRICE POINT IS
A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH.
WHY? BECAUSE I'M MANUFACTURING
IN SMALL QUANTITIES.
RETAIL PRICE??THEY'RE $119.
AND KEEP IN MIND??
$119?
YES, MA'AM.
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT, INCLUDING THE BOX?
UM, EVERYTHING ALL TOLD,
IT'S $49.
I JUST CAN'T GET OVER THIS??
THE AMOUNT OF SALES.
YOU'RE ONLY DOING
$11,000 A YEAR IN SALES.
BUT IT'S JUST ME. THIS IS
ME WORKING A FULL?TIME JOB.
I'D BE DANGEROUS IF I WAS
DOING THIS FULL?TIME.
LET'S MAKE NO JOKE ABOUT THAT.
I'M NOT KIDDING.
YOU'RE SCARING ME NOW.
THIS IS ME FROM 10:00 AT NIGHT
TILL 2:00 IN THE MORNING
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.
IS THIS TRUE?
WE HAVE A FIRECRACKER
SALES LADY. WE GOT A GREAT IDEA.
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS ANY
DISTRIBUTION. NOW WE GOT MR.??
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR!
NOW WAIT A SECOND.
WE GOT A MR. CLOTHING GUY HERE.
WHAT'S THE STORY ON THIS,
DAYMOND?
WELL, HERE'S??
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE??
HOW DO YOU EDUCATE THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY THAT THIS EXISTS?
PREGNANCY'S NOT A TREND.
IT'S NOT A FAD.
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
SO YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A $4.5 BILLION MARKET.
SO YOU'RE GETTING IN NOW
WITH A BRANDED PRODUCT
THAT PEOPLE KNOW, RESPECT,
AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING??
THEY DON'T KNOW
AND RESPECT IT.
NOBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE,
DEIDREA.
HOW DO YOU KNOW? THEY DO.
YOU'RE DOING $11,000 A YEAR
IN SALES.
THIS IS BRAND?NEW.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR 30K,
AND THAT WILL NOT EVEN GET YOU
PAST JUST PAYING YOURSELF.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT GETS ME
PAST. I NEED MORE INVENTORY.
SO THE NEXT TIME I GO
TO MY MANUFACTURER,
I'M GOING WITH BIGGER NUMBERS,
'CAUSE NOW I HAVE MONEY,
INSTEAD OF GOING "HERE'S
MY COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS
FOR A HUNDRED GOWNS."
BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS
NOT ADDRESSED.
BRING IT UP!
DEIDREA, YOU'RE??YOU'RE
A FANTASTIC SALES REP,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S MISSING WITH YOU.
THANK YOU. BRING IT.
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING HOW YOU'RE
GONNA GROW, HOW YOU'RE
GONNA ADVERTISE??YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THOSE COSTS.
OF COURSE I DO.
WELL, DEIDREA, HOW COULD YOU?
HOW COULD $30,000 PUT YOU
INTO ANY KIND OF A BRANDING/
ADVERTISING/MARKETING PROGRAM
ON A NATIONAL SCALE?
YOU KNOW,
LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT THIS.
I LIKE TO BRING CLARITY
TO THESE SITUATIONS.
(chuckles) BRING IT.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
WITH THIS BUSINESS IS
ACTUALLY GETTING THE PRODUCT
TO THE CUSTOMER.
IT'S NOT, THOUGH.
EXCUSE ME. IN MY MIND,
AS AN INVESTOR,
YOU HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THE COST
OF CUSTOMER ACQUISITION,
WHICH I BET IS BRUTAL.
EVERYBODY'S BEEN ASKING YOU,
PARTICULARLY ME,
WHAT DOES IT COST ME
TO GROW THE BUSINESS?
YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT.
I'M N??I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME,
BECAUSE I?I HAVE ALL
THE ANSWERS. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
THIS IS NEW. IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIVE YEARS.
IT'S A NEW IDEA.
WE'RE EDUCATING THE CUSTOMER.
RIGHT THERE??
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IT.
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS YET.
IT'S AN IDEA.
AND MAYBE IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA,
BUT BETWEEN AN IDEA
AND A BUSINESS IS
ONE HELL OF A LONG ROAD.
I DON'T AGREE.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT ROAD.
I DON'T WANT TO RIDE THAT ROAD
WITH YOU. I'M SORRY.
IT'S A GOOD ROAD.
(O'Leary) IT'S A LONG ROAD.
I'M OUT.
IS THERE NO WAY TO MAKE
THIS GOWN ONE SIZE FITS ALL?
THERE'S ACTUALLY
A GREAT POINT IN THAT.
THIS ISN'T A THROWAWAY GOWN
THAT YOU GO,
OH, I'M GIVE BIRTH INTO IT
AND THROW AWAY.
IT FITS A WOMAN BEFORE,
DURING, AND AFTER.
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO THE IDEA
OF MAKING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL?
DEIDREA?
(normal voice) YES.
I HAVE TO SAY, I CAN'T GET OVER
THE PART?TIME SITUATION.
THIS IS ALWAYS
GONNA BE MY HUSTLE.
I'M GONNA SAY I'M OUT.
SO IT'S??IT'S BAD
THAT I HAVE A JOB?
IS THAT??IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
THE BUSINESS IS NOT
GENERATING ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO PAY
FULL?TIME ATTENTION,
SO WHY SHOULD HIS MONEY
PAY FULL?TIME ATTENTION?
YEAH. IT'S TOO RISKY FOR ME.
THANK YOU.
THAT LEAVES ME.
HI, BARBARA.
OH, DON'T GIVE ME
THAT LITTLE GIRL LOOK.
(laughs)
I'M OKAY WITH WHAT YOU SOLD
SO FAR WITH NO ADVERTISING,
BUT I AM VERY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU AS A PARTNER.
SO??SO YOU MAKING AN OFFER
OUT OF ALL THIS?
BARBARA, I FORBID YOU
TO INVEST IN THIS BUSINESS.
I'M TIRED OF YOU KILLING MONEY.
DEIDREA, LET ME PUT THIS
TO THE TEST, ALL RIGHT?
I'D BE INTERESTED
IN BUYING INTO YOUR BUSINESS.
(O'Leary)
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S CRYING?
NO, NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.
BUT I AM CONCERNED, AGAIN,
ABOUT YOUR OPEN?MINDEDNESS,
SO LET ME PUT WHAT THE PIECES
ARE ON THE TABLE.
ONE, I WOULD WANT YOU
TO BE TOTALLY OPEN
TO MAKING A CHEAPER GOWN...
I'M TOTALLY OPEN TO IT.
TOTALLY OPEN
TO MAYBE EVEN A BAG...
ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE PEOPLE
REQUEST THOSE.
TOTALLY OPEN TO MAYBE THREE
SIZES??SMALL, MEDIUM, AND LARGE,
THAT SPAN A COUPLE OF SIZES,
EACH ONE.
I WOULD BE OPEN TO IT.
AND YOU MEAN IT?
AND TOTALLY OPEN
TO KEEPING YOUR DAY JOB
FOR THE NEXT HOWEVER MANY YEARS
BEFORE THIS BUSINESS COULD
AFFORD TO TAKE A DIME OUT,
WITHOUT COMPLAINING?
I'M NOT A COMPLAINER. (laughs)
GO BIG OR GO HOME.
THOSE ARE YOUR CONDITIONS,
BARBARA?
YEAH, THEY'RE THE CONDITIONS.
SO ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER
OUT OF ALL THIS?
SO I'M MAKING AN OFFER
FOR $30,000
FOR 40% OF YOUR BUSINESS,
AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY THE 40%.
BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA TAKE
A LOT OF MY TIME.
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO
REINVENT YOUR PRODUCT,
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AN ANGLE
TO MARKET THIS THING,
AND I WANT TO BE INTERESTED
ENOUGH IN IT TO PUT IN THE TIME.
BARBARA. BARBARA.
SHE SOLD A HUNDRED GOWNS.
THAT'S EIGHT GOWNS A MONTH.
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S A START.
EVERYBODY SITTING UP HERE
STARTED THERE.
DON'T KNOCK HER FOR THAT.
BARBARA, WHEN YOU DIE??
WHEN YOU DIE AND GO TO HELL,
YOU'RE GONNA BE
SELLING MATERNITY GOWNS.
BUT YOU'LL LOOK GREAT.
(Barbara) OH, GOOD.
DO YOU ACCEPT HER OFFER?
40%'s TOO HIGH.
HA HA! SHE'S SAYING NO TO YOU!
WHOA!
I THINK THE OFFER'S GREAT,
BUT 40%'s TOO HIGH.
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.
I LOVE IT.
I THINK WE'RE ALL OUT, DEIDREA.
OKAY. (sighs) THANKS, GUYS.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
SORRY FOR THE TEARS.
HUGE MISTAKE TO TURN THAT OFFER
DOWN, IN MY OPINION.
IT'S REALLY A SHAME THOUGH,
BECAUSE I COULD'VE
MADE THAT BUSINESS FLY.
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.
I TURNED DOWN BARBARA BECAUSE
SHE HAD TOO MANY CONDITIONS
ON THE MONEY AND ON WHAT
SHE WANTED TO DO WITH THE BRAND.
SHE WANTED TO TAKE
THE SIZE RANGE AWAY,
WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
TO THE HOT MAMA GOWN,
BECAUSE IT'S SIZED TO FIT
BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER BIRTH,
AND THAT JUST DIDN'T COINCIDE
WITH WHERE I SEE
THE BRAND GOING.
I PROMISE YOU, ROBERT,
I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.
I WILL MAKE GREASE MONKEY WIPES
BE A NATIONAL, FANTASTIC,
SUCCESSFUL BRAND.
WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.
I PROMISE.
(Robert) GOOD JOB.
