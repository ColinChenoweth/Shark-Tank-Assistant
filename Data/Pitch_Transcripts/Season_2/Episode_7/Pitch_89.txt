HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS LES COOKSON.
MY PRODUCT IS THE CARSIK BIB.
I AM SEEKING
A $30,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF MY COMPANY.
NOW JUST IMAGINE FOR A MINUTE,
THAT YOU'RE DRIVING
DOWN THE STREET WITH
YOUR BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CHILD HERE
THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE...
OH, GOD!
(Jeff laughs)
(Barbara) OH, NO!
YOU HAD TO PUT
THE CORN IN IT,
DIDN'T YOU, LES? WOW.
(laughs)
LES, I GOTTA KNOW??
WHAT WAS IN THAT STUFF?
SERIOUSLY, REGARDLESS
OF WHAT THE KID DOES,
THERE ARE NO PRODUCTS
THAT DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.
BUT, LES, I'M DRIVING MY CAR,
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES?
OKAY, SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO MASS?PRODUCE THIS.
I JUST HAVE THESE ONES
YOU HAVE HERE.
I, UM, SOLD 'EM ONLINE
WITH A VERY, YOU KNOW,
TEN HITS A DAY ON A WEB SITE??
VERY SMALL TEST RUN.
I SOLD 160 OF 'EM
IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
HERE'S ANOTHER THING
I WORRY ABOUT, LES,
IS A LIABILITY ISSUE,
IN THAT YOU GOT A CHILD
YOU CAN'T GET TO
WITH SOMETHING ATTACHED
AROUND ITS NECK.
I?I LIKE YOU A LOT, LES,
LOOK, LES, I'M LIKE JEFF.
I WORRY ABOUT MY KID BEHIND ME
WITH A PLASTIC BAG
AROUND THEIR NECK
THAT I CAN'T GET TO THEM.
I'M OUT.
I HAVE A 5 YEAR OLD.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HANGING THIS
ON HER NECK.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
(Jeff) YOU BET. GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT. TRY NOT TO TRACK OUT
THE VOMIT TOO FAR, HUH?
NOW WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.
I THINK IT STILL HAS
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
THAT THERE'S A??
(chuckles) SO IF WE BRING YOU
THIS PRODUCT RIGHT HERE,
I HAD SALES IN 2007.
IN 2007, I WAS SINGLE.
WHAT YOUR SALES WERE
BACK IN 2007.
$100,000 WORTH OF SALES
IN 2007.
WHY COULD YOU AFFORD
TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR NOW?
WHAT'S CHANGED?
I WORK FOR A GREAT COMPANY.
NO, BUT HOW WOULD
YOU MAKE THE TIME, THOUGH,
IS WHAT I'M QUESTIONING.
WELL, I'M HOPING I CAN GET
A DISTRIBUTION DEAL
OR SOMETHING IN PLACE,
TO WHERE I CAN SHIFT MY FOCUS
YOU NEED TO MAKE
SOME SALES CALLS, MY FRIEND,
'CAUSE I THINK THE ONLY GUY
WHO CAN REALLY DO THIS IS YOU.
YOU JUST GOTTA FIND A WAY.
SO I'M OUT.
HAS THIS BEEN USED
IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE GAMES
SPIN AT OVER
150 MILES PER HOUR,
IS THAT IT HAS
A FRICTIONLESS CUTTING SYSTEM.
WHEN THESE BLADES SPIN,
THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT TOUCHING.
THERE'S A VERY SMALL GAP
THAT CREATES NO FRICTION,
NO CONTACT,
HIS SALES PITCH WAS
"THE GRASS FALLS GENTLY
BEHIND THE MOWER."
WE BRING THE COOLEST STUFF TO
YOUR DOORSTEP.
AAH!
NO! OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
FROM ANYTHING WE'VE DONE, TOO.
THAT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW, WORKING TOGETHER
AS BROTHERS IS A LOT OF FUN.
I'VE KNOWN THE GUY
MY WHOLE LIFE.
THEY'RE ON TO YOU, KEVIN. RUN.
I'M SOLD.
THAT'S COOL.
GAMES2U HAS
SPECIALIZED VEHICLES.
INSIDE OF OUR VEHICLES,
OKAY. HUMOR ME. YOU'D BETTER
HAVE SOME FANTASTIC SALES.
$3.5 MILLION IN GROSS SALES.
THIS YEAR WE'RE UP 65%.
WE'RE TRACKING FOR $5 MILLION
IN TOP LINE SALES.
MM.
I REALLY WANNA KNOW
WHAT BOOGER WARS IS.
(chuckles)
BOOGER WARS IS A GREAT GAME.
ARE THEY <i>YOUR</i> SALES,
INCLUDING THE FRANCHISEE SALES?
NO, SIR. THOSE ARE PURELY
OUR SALES. CORPORATE.
SO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS,
YOU SELL THE LICENSE
TO THE FRANCHISEES,
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO MAKE MONEY
UNLESS YOU DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT,
WHICH IS A SUNK COST FOR YOU
THAT YOU CAN'T GET BACK
FROM THE FRANCHISEES.
I HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH THAT MODEL.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER, OKAY?
LET'S START WITH THIS.
