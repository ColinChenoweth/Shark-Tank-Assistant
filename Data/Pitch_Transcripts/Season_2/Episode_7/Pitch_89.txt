MY NAME IS CHRIS SPENCER.
I'M FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
MY COMPANY IS HYDROMAX.
(man speaks indistinctly)
(man) RACK 'EM UP. HIT HIM
AND DRIVE. RACK 'EM UP. HIT IT.
(whistle blows)
(Chris) IN AMERICA,
THE GAME OF FOOTBALL
IS THE NUMBER ONE SPORT,
AND EVERY YEAR,
THERE'S 14 MILLION KIDS
THAT ARE SUBJECT
TO HAVING HEATSTROKES
AND DEHYDRATION
FROM HEAT?RELATED INCIDENTS.
KIDS ARE DYING RIGHT NOW,
AND I THINK IT'S UP TO US
TO CREATE A SOLUTION
FOR THE GAME THAT WE LOVE.
SO I'VE BEEN AN ATHLETE
MY WHOLE LIFE.
I WAS ON TRACK
TO GO PROFESSIONAL,
BUT I'VE HAD MORE PASSION
ABOUT THIS
THAN ANY SPORT I'VE EVER PLAYED.
THIS PRODUCT IS LEGIT.
I HAD N. A. S. A. ENGINEERS
REVIEW IT.
HYDROMAX IS GONNA TAKE THE GAME
TO A NEW LEVEL.
BUT IT'S??IT'S ON THE SHELF
RIGHT NOW
'CAUSE I'M FOCUSED
ON SUPPORTING MY FAMILY.
HYDROMAX IS NOT
MY FULL?TIME JOB.
I'M IN CORPORATE AMERICA
FULL?TIME,
AND THAT'S WHERE
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD
TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO GO
INTO BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR.
DO I TAKE THAT RISK? DO I PUT
MY FAMILY IN THAT SITUATION?
OR DO I STAY
IN CORPORATE AMERICA
AND LET A GREAT PRODUCT
GO TO WASTE?
AND THAT'S??THAT'S REALLY
WHERE I NEED HELP.
WITHOUT IT,
HYDROMAX WILL SIT ON THE SHELF,
AND MILLIONS OF KIDS WILL
CONTINUE TO BE AT RISK.
IF I GET AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS,
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY SAVE LIVES.
MY NAME IS CHRIS SPENCER
MY COMPANY IS HYDROMAX.
TODAY I'M ASKING FOR $50,000
FOR 25% OF MY COMPANY.
THERE ARE 14 MILLION KIDS
PLAYING THE GAME OF FOOTBALL
TODAY.
TODAY THERE ARE KIDS,
LIKE ETHAN HERE,
THAT ARE DYING OF HAVING
LACK OF HYDRATION
AND THE ABILITY TO GET WATER
WHEN THEY NEED TO
ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
HYDROMAX WILL ALLOW A CHILD
TO HAVE HYDRATION ACCESS
100% OF THE TIME,
WHEN THEY NEED IT, IN BETWEEN
PLAYS ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD.
LET ME BREAK THIS PRODUCT DOWN
FOR YOU.
THERE'S A HYDRATION SYSTEM
THAT MOUNTS
TO THE BACK OF ANY PAIR
OF SHOULDER PADS.
IT ATTACHES WITH VELCRO.
IT HAS A PROTECTIVE SHELL,
SO IT'S IMPACT?RESISTANT.
IT HOLDS A 16?OUNCE BLADDER
THAT'S MADE OUT
OF ANTIMICROBIAL MATERIAL.
AND THEN THERE'S A TUBE THAT
COMES AROUND THE SHOULDER PADS
AND HAS A BITE VALVE.
THAT WAY, A CHILD CAN
PULL IT OUT IN BETWEEN PLAYS
WHEN THEY'RE IN A GAME
AND HAVE ACCESS TO WATER.
ETHAN, SHOW THEM HOW EASY IT IS
TO ACCESS WATER.
(gulping)
THAT SIMPLE.
YOU'RE BASICALLY TAKING
A CAMELBAK??
WE USE THOSE FOR RUNNING,
WHEN YOU CAN'T, UH,
GET ACCESS TO WATER.
IS THERE ANY CONCERN WITH
THE WATER SPOUT AT THE END
GETTING CAUGHT IN HIS NECK?
IT'S ACTUALLY HELD FIRMLY
AGAINST THE CHEST WITH VELCRO.
AND THE REASON IT'S POINTING
DOWNWARD IN THE TIGHT JERSEY
IS SO THAT WAY,
IT DOESN'T JUST FLAP UP.
HOW MUCH MORE DOES THAT PAD COST
TO A TRADITIONAL PAD?
THIS PAD IS ACTUALLY A SEPARATE
BRAND OF SHOULDER PADS.
THIS SYSTEM MOUNTS
TO ANY PAIR OF SHOULDER PADS.
NOW THE VISION
WOULD BE MAYBE ONE DAY,
YOU KNOW, WE GET THE PRODUCT TO
THE MARKET, MAYBE WE CAN PARTNER
WITH A COMPANY AND BUILD IT
INTO THE SHOULDER PADS,
TO WHERE THIS CAN BE ATTACHED
TO EVERY SINGLE PAIR
OF SHOULDER PADS,
LIKE A SEAT BELT IS IN A CAR.
AND I ASSUME THAT THIS IS
A PATENTED PRODUCT?
YES.
CHRIS, CAN I BUY THIS
FOR FOOTBALL
AND USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE?
IT'S DESIGNED FOR FOOTBALL.
I THINK WHAT HE'S ASKING??
WELL, CAN YOU MAKE IT FIT
THE BACK OF A SUIT JACKET,
WITH SCOTCH IN IT,
WHERE IT WOULD JUST
COME AROUND...
(sharks laugh)
JEFF, YOU READ MY MIND. THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS ASKING.
MM?HMM.
CHRIS, WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR
AND WHAT DO YOU PAY FOR IT
TO BE MANUFACTURED?
$49.99.
$8.50 TO MANUFACTURE IT.
TO RUN MY COMPANY FULL?TIME.
CHRIS, DOES YOUR??
DOES YOUR WIFE WORK?
YES, SHE'S A TEACHER,
FULL?TIME.
CHRIS, I DON'T THINK
YOU MENTIONED
CHRIS, THE VALUATION
OF YOUR BUSINESS IS WAY OFF,
BASICALLY VALUING THE COMPANY
AT $200,000. I'M OUT.
CHRIS, I DON'T HAVE
THE CONTACTS YOU NEED,
AND I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE
TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS GO.
SO I'M OUT.
CHRIS, IT'S CLEVER.
VERY CLEVER.
BUT...
SOMETIMES IN LIFE, YOU JUST
CAN'T AVOID HARD WORK.
YOU GOTTA GO OUT THERE
AND??AND SELL THIS.
ROBERT,
IF??IF??IF WE DID A DEAL,
I'M GONNA BE COMPLETELY HUMBLE
IN THE PROCESS.
I JUST WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME RIGHT NOW.
IT'S ABOUT HIM.
HE'S STILL GONNA BE OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW,
IN 100?DEGREE TEMPERATURE,
PLAYING FOOTBALL IN TEXAS,
AND COULD DIE.
