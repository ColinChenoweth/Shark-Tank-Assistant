HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS LES COOKSON.
MY PRODUCT IS THE CARSIK BIB.
I AM SEEKING
A $30,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF MY COMPANY.
NOW JUST IMAGINE FOR A MINUTE,
THAT YOU'RE DRIVING
DOWN THE STREET WITH
YOUR BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CHILD HERE
THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE...
OH, GOD!
(Jeff laughs)
(Barbara) OH, NO!
YOU HAD TO PUT
THE CORN IN IT,
DIDN'T YOU, LES? WOW.
(laughs)
LES, I GOTTA KNOW??
WHAT WAS IN THAT STUFF?
WHAT WAS THAT GREEN STUFF?
SPLIT PEA SOUP AND CORN.
FOR THE PARENTS OF THE 58%
OF CHILDREN WHO GET CARSICK,
THIS IS
AN ALL?TOO?FAMILIAR SITUATION.
IT IS LIKE DRIVING AROUND
WITH A TICKING TIME BOMB.
YOUR POOR CHILD IS
SOPPING IN VOMIT.
OFTEN, YOU JUST WANT TO THROW
THEIR WHOLE OUTFITS AWAY,
BECAUSE TOUCHING IT IS TOO GROSS
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT.
THIS IS WHY I CREATED
THE CARSIK BIB.
THE CARSIK BIB IS THE SMART,
HANDS?FREE BARF BAG FOR KIDS.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
(Velcro rips)
YOU ATTACH IT
LIKE A REGULAR BIB.
(sharks laugh)
IT??IT'S A BIB.
IT'S A BIB.
IT'S A CARSIK BIB.
IT'S A FEED BAG, TOO.
(Daymond) YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S THE REVERSE FEED BAG.
NO KIDDING.
THEN, YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT HAPPENS...
(man) UGH.
(sharks laugh)
I LOVE IT.
AND??AND IF THE KID
GETS HUNGRY LATER...
YOU STICK A STRAW IN IT.
(laughs)
SERIOUSLY, REGARDLESS
OF WHAT THE KID DOES,
EVERYTHING IS DIRECTED INTO
AND CONTAINED IN THE POUCH.
A PAD IN THE POUCH
SOAKS UP LIQUID,
WHICH PREVENTS SPILLING
AND REDUCES ODOR.
THEN, YOU KNOW,
AFTER IT'S DONE,
YOU FIND A SAFE PLACE
TO PULL OVER.
YOU REMOVE THE CARSIK BIB...
(Velcro rips)
THROW EVERYTHING
IN THE POUCH...
AND THE BOTTOM FLIPS UP,
ZIPS SHUT,
AND YOU THROW IT ALL AWAY.
I WILL SAY THIS??
I HAVE A HARD TIME
LISTENING TO YOU
ONE YOU'RE STANDING IN VOMIT.
(sharks laugh)
HOW DID YOU THINK OF THIS?
I GOTTA KNOW.
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION?
WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL.
THIS IS FROM EXPERIENCE.
I HAVE TWO LITTLE BOYS WHO GET
CARSICK, AND THEY THROW UP
AND THEY GIVE NO WARNING.
THERE ARE NO PRODUCTS
THAT DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.
BUT, LES, I'M DRIVING MY CAR,
AND MY KID'S PUKING IN THE BACK.
HOW DO I TURN AROUND QUICKLY,
PUT IT AROUND HIS NECK OR DO I
JUST PERMANENTLY PUT THAT
ON THE CHILD EVERY DAY
OF HIS LIFE?
EVERY DAY.
WAITING. WAITING.
EVERYWHERE HE GOES.
SOME CHILDREN SERIOUSLY THROW UP
EVERY TIME THEY DRIVE ANYWHERE,
LIKE, 15 MINUTES,
THEY'RE THROWING UP.
CAN I SEE ONE OF THOSE,
PLEASE?
YEAH, YEAH.
(Daymond) JUST GIVE ME ONE.
I MAY NEED IT.
WHAT'S THE COST TO MAKE ONE?
19 CENTS.
INCLUDING THE PAD
AT THE BOTTOM?
YES, INCLUDING. UM...
(laughs) NOW I KNOW
WHY THE KID IS THROWING UP.
IS THIS
A MULTIPURPOSE PRODUCT?
WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL, IS THAT
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING MYSELF.
I?I BUILT THE PROTOTYPE MYSELF,
I'VE BEEN SELLING THEM MYSELF,
AND I HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTING
THEM OF PARTS, YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE??LIKE THE BIB THERE IS
A SHOWER CURTAIN I CUT UP.
SO I'VE, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
USING MY IN??IN, YOU KNOW,
MY, UH...
INGENUITY.
INGENUITY. YOU KNOW, WHEN
IT'S ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED,
UH, PROFESSIONALLY,
IT WILL BE MADE
OF JUST
THE SAME BASIC MATERIALS.
THE ONLY THING I THINK
IS THE??THE??
WORSE THAN VOMITING
IS RIDING AROUND WITH
A BAG OF VOMIT ON YOUR NECK.
(laughs)
(laughs)
HEY, LISTEN, WHEN MY KIDS
WERE LITTLE, THEY WOULD...
(imitates vomiting)
WHACK!
(laughs)
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES?
OKAY, SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO MASS?PRODUCE THIS.
I JUST HAVE THESE ONES
YOU HAVE HERE.
I, UM, SOLD 'EM ONLINE
WITH A VERY, YOU KNOW,
TEN HITS A DAY ON A WEB SITE??
VERY SMALL TEST RUN.
I SOLD 160 OF 'EM
IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU HAVE INTO THIS?
UM, $1,300 AND I'VE DONE
EVERYTHING MYSELF.
IF I HAD HIRED OUT EVERYTHING,
I COULD HAVE EASILY SPENT
$10,000, $20,000.
YOU HAVE $1,300,
AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR $30,000
FOR 15%.
RIGHT.
UH, I COULDN'T GIVE YOU
$30,000 FOR THIS.
I'M OUT.
I GOTTA TELL YA, I MEAN, I??
IF I ACTUALLY GAVE YOU 30 GRAND,
I <i>WOULD</i> THROW UP IN THIS THING.
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE DOING THAT.
IT'S NOT A PLACE
WHERE I WANT TO SAY,
"I MADE A GREAT INVESTMENT TODAY
IN BARF BAGS."
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
IN MY PORTFOLIO.
I'M OUT.
HERE'S ANOTHER THING
I WORRY ABOUT, LES,
IS A LIABILITY ISSUE,
IN THAT YOU GOT A CHILD
YOU CAN'T GET TO
WITH SOMETHING ATTACHED
AROUND ITS NECK.
AND I JUST KNOW KIDS,
AND WHEN SOMETHING HAS
A CHANCE TO GO WRONG,
IT'S GONNA GO WRONG.
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION??
THERE ARE ALREADY BIBS MADE
FOR??DISPOSABLE BIBS MADE??
APPROVED ON CHILDREN
AS??AS YOUNG AS 6 MONTHS,
AND SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT'S UNTESTED OR UNDONE.
I?I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT USUALLY A CHILD WITH
A BIB ON, YOU'RE FEEDING THEM
AND YOU'RE THERE WITH 'EM.
I?I LIKE YOU A LOT, LES,
AND I??AND I WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST, BUT I'M OUT.
LOOK, LES, I'M LIKE JEFF.
I WORRY ABOUT MY KID BEHIND ME
WITH A PLASTIC BAG
AROUND THEIR NECK
THAT I CAN'T GET TO THEM.
I'M OUT.
I HAVE A 5 YEAR OLD.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HANGING THIS
ON HER NECK.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
(Jeff) YOU BET. GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT. TRY NOT TO TRACK OUT
THE VOMIT TOO FAR, HUH?
NOW WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.
I THINK IT STILL HAS
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
THAT THERE'S A??
THERE'S A HUGE MARKET FOR,
AND THEY DIDN'T SEE IT.
THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FIVE PEOPLE.
THE ARMS ALSO SHOOT NERF BALLS,
SO EVERYBODY DUCK.
(sharks laugh)
(chuckles) SO IF WE BRING YOU
THIS PRODUCT RIGHT HERE,
AND IT COMES PREPACKAGED
WITH A BOTTLE.
AND YOU FILL IT UP. OKAY.
AND DO YOU HAVE SALES TODAY,
CHRIS?
I HAD SALES IN 2007.
IN 2007, I WAS SINGLE.
AND I FELL IN LOVE
WITH MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE,
AND I DECIDED TO CHANGE
MY CAREER PATH.
I WENT TO CORPORATE AMERICA,
AND I WASN'T ABLE
WHAT YOUR SALES WERE
BACK IN 2007.
$100,000 WORTH OF SALES
IN 2007.
WHY COULD YOU AFFORD
TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR NOW?
WHAT'S CHANGED?
I WORK FOR A GREAT COMPANY.
NO, BUT HOW WOULD
YOU MAKE THE TIME, THOUGH,
IS WHAT I'M QUESTIONING.
WELL, I'M HOPING I CAN GET
A DISTRIBUTION DEAL
OR SOMETHING IN PLACE,
TO WHERE I CAN SHIFT MY FOCUS
AND DO THIS FULL?TIME.
IT'S A REALLY CLEVER DESIGN.
DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS?
YES. I DESIGNED IT.
I?I WAS AN ATHLETE.
I?I ENVISIONED IT WHEN I WAS
ACTUALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL,
'CAUSE I HAD THIS ISSUE.
NOW E?EVERY SUMMER, I'M READING
ABOUT SOME KID IN HIGH SCHOOL
DYING FROM BEING OVERHEATED
OR??OR WHATEVER. I MEAN??
COLLEGE, HIGH SCHOOL.
YEAH.
WHAT YOU NEED IS TO GET
A LARGE MANUFACTURER/DISTRIBUTOR
TO TAKE THIS ON
AND PAY YOU A LICENSE.
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE TIME
TO GO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE
WORKING FULL?TIME SUPPORTING
YOUR FAMILY. THAT'S YOUR STORY.
YOU WANT SOMEONE HERE
TO DO THAT.
I LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE
LIKE YOU DOING ALL THE WORK
SO I CAN SIT AT HOME,
EAT BONBONS.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.
NOBODY WANTS TO SAVE CHILDREN
MORE THAN I DO, PARTICULARLY
IF I CAN PROFIT FROM IT.
I LOVE THAT PART.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON.
I'M OUT.
YOU NEED TO MAKE
SOME SALES CALLS, MY FRIEND,
'CAUSE I THINK THE ONLY GUY
WHO CAN REALLY DO THIS IS YOU.
YOU JUST GOTTA FIND A WAY.
SO I'M OUT.
HAS THIS BEEN USED
IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE GAMES
AND??AND PROVEN TO WORK?
YES, SIR. ABSOLUTELY.
I'VE HAD PLAYERS IN COLLEGE
WEAR IT.
IT WAS IN THE 2007 HULA BOWL.
WHAT ARE YOUR EXPANSION PLANS?
WHAT??WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT
DOWN THE ROAD?
MY EXPANSION PLAN WOULD BE
TO GET IT ON KIDS' SHOULDER PADS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FIRST,
THEN HOPEFULLY, WE CAN BUILD IT
IN THE SHOULDER PADS.
MY PATENT WOULD PROTECT THAT.
WE CAN GET
INTO CAMELBAK'S MARKET.
CAMELBAK SIGNED A $100 MILLION
DEAL WITH THE MILITARY
WHEN THEY LAUNCHED
THEIR PRODUCT.
WE CAN GET INTO THAT MARKET.
THEIR PATENT DOES NOT PROTECT
A HYDRATION SYSTEM.
HERE'S WHERE WE STAND.
OKAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME
TO DO THIS.
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER JOB.
YOU'VE GOT A NEW FAMILY.
CORRECT.
YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO STEP IN.
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA,
AND THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS.
YES, SIR.
BUT YOU GOTTA RUN
THIS BUSINESS.
I'LL GO $50,000...
FOR 50%.
I'LL PARTNER WITH YOU.
JEFF, YOU'RE GETTING OUT
OF THE COMEDY BUSINESS?
YOU'RE GONNA START SELLING
HYDRATION BAGS?
I'M IN THE IDEA BUSINESS.
HE'S GOT A GREAT IDEA.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE YOUR MONEY
ON EVERYBODY'S MOTHER THAT HAS
A KID THAT PLAYS LITTLE LEAGUE,
GOING "I WANT"??
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
EVERY WORRIED MOTHER OUT THERE.
TO ME, IT'S A GREAT IDEA,
AND??AND??AND STRICTLY
FROM THE STANDPOINT
OF CONCERNED MOMS AND DADS.
AND??AND HERE'S THE DEAL??ONCE
ONE KID ON THE TEAM HAS IT...
EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE IT.
EVERYBODY'S GOTTA HAVE IT.
I'M ALL ABOUT KIDS.
WORK WITH
CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS,
HOST A KIDS' SHOW,
WRITE CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
I?I THINK THAT'S YOUR MARKET
FOR THAT.
YOU AND I PARTNER TOGETHER
ON THIS, WE'LL MAKE THIS WORK.
YOU'VE GOT AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE.
I SAY YOU HAVE A DEAL.
(Jeff) WHOO! WHOO!
(laughs) THAT'S AWESOME.
YOU'RE GONNA BE GLAD
YOU DID THIS.
YOU KNOW, I'M SMARTER
THAN A FIFTH GRADER.
I'M NOT. I'M GLAD YOU ARE,
'CAUSE I'M NOT.
WE DID IT, ETHAN.
VERY EXCITING.
(Barbara laughs)
THERE YOU GO, BABY.
WHOO!
(Daymond) CONGRATULATIONS.
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S??
IT ALL STARTS WITH THE IDEA.
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
STOP GLOATING, FOR GOD SAKES.
(laughs)
WHOO! I GOT A DEAL, BABY.
IT'S GOOD.
SPIN AT OVER
150 MILES PER HOUR,
AND THEY CAUSE NEARLY 80,000
HOSPITAL INJURIES EVERY YEAR.
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE REASON I'M HERE.
THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE
LAWN MOWERS ARE TERRIBLE,
EMISSIONS FROM LAWN MOWERS IS
TOTALLY UNREGULATED,
AND THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION
THAT'S EMITTED
IN JUST ONE HOUR
OF USING A LAWN MOWER
IS LIKE DRIVING TEN CARS.
REALLY?
WHY IS EVERYBODY TALKING ABOUT
CARS WHEN LAWN MOWERS ARE
WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?
THEY ARE BIG?TIME POLLUTERS.
SO THE NEXT BIG
BILLION?DOLLAR MOVEMENT
IS REDUCING EMISSIONS
FROM LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT.
WHO SAID?
THE E. P. A. IS ABOUT
TO REGULATE, COME 2012,
EMISSIONS
ON LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT,
AND IT'S ALREADY STARTING NOW.
SO I'VE COME UP
WITH A FANTASTIC SOLUTION,
AND IT'S CALLED THE ECOMOWER.
THE ECOMOWER IS THE WORLD'S
MOST ECO?FRIENDLY LAWN MOWER??
REQUIRES NO GAS, NO BATTERIES,
AND IT'S COMPLETELY SILENT.
SO LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK
EXAMPLE ON HOW IT WORKS.
SO THE ECOMOWER
PUSHES WITH EASE.
IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY EASY
TO PUSH IT.
AND YOU'LL NOTICE
THAT AS I CUT THE GRASS,
THE CLIPPINGS GENTLY COME DOWN
BEHIND THE MOWER
AND ACTUALLY NATURALLY
FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN.
NOW THE REASON THAT
THIS ISN'T YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
OLD LAWN MOWER
IS THAT IT HAS
A FRICTIONLESS CUTTING SYSTEM.
WHEN THESE BLADES SPIN,
THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT TOUCHING.
THERE'S A VERY SMALL GAP
THAT CREATES NO FRICTION,
NO CONTACT,
AND THE BEAUTY OF THAT IS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARPEN IT.
I?I?I?I AM TOTALLY LOST.
(Robert) LOST WHAT?
GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU TALK??
"THE GRASS FALL GENTLY
BEHIND THE MOWER"?
THIS IS LIKE WHAT WE CALL
ROMANCING THE TRUTH.
SO DO YOU GUYS NOT BELIEVE THAT
ECO?FRIENDLY LAWN MOWERS IS
GOING TO BE THE CATEGORY
OF THE FUTURE?
I?I??THERE'S A WHOLE CATEGORY
OF PUSHED MOWERS.
(Robert) WELL, HOW BIG IS
THAT MARKET TODAY?
AND??AND WHO SAYS THAT THOSE
CAN'T RUN
JUST AS EASILY AS THIS ONE?
SORRY, DAYMOND. ARE YOU SAYING
WHY ISN'T HE COMPARING THIS
TO THE ONES
THAT ALREADY EXIST?
THE??THE PUSH MOWERS THAT
CURRENTLY EXIST ON THE MARKET.
DAY??LET ME INTERPRET.
AND THIS YEAR
I'M UP TO $350,000 IN SALES.
OF YOUR COMPETING PRODUCTS.
CORRECT.
SO DID YOU SELL ECOMOWERS
OR OTHER GUYS'?
THIS IS A PROTOTYPE MOWER.
I'M LOOKING TO YOU
TO HELP ME MANUFACTURE THIS.
I'M SELLING
OTHER PEOPLE'S MOWERS.
SO YOU SOLD $350,000
OF THE TRADITIONAL PUSH MOWERS
BUT NONE OF THE ECOMOWER.
NOT THIS MOWER, CORRECT.
OH, COME ON.
AND WHEN YOU THINK
OF THE NAME "ECOMOWER,"
THERE IS NOTHING
MORE ECO?FRIENDLY WITH THIS??
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
TO A LARGE MANUFACTURER
AND SAY, "I WANT
TO PRIVATE LABEL YOUR MOWER
AND PUT MY BRAND ON IT"? BECAUSE
LOTS OF GUYS MANUFACTURE THESE.
MANY OF THEM ARE MADE IN CHINA,
AND YOU CAN SAY,
"MINE IS THE ECOMOWER."
WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT?
HIS SALES PITCH WAS
"THE GRASS FALLS GENTLY
BEHIND THE MOWER."
WE BRING THE COOLEST STUFF TO
YOUR DOORSTEP.
AAH!
NO! OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
FROM ANYTHING WE'VE DONE, TOO.
THAT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW, WORKING TOGETHER
AS BROTHERS IS A LOT OF FUN.
I'VE KNOWN THE GUY
MY WHOLE LIFE.
AND I DO ALL THE HARD WORK,
HE TAKES ALL THE CREDIT.
YEAH. AND IF THINGS DON'T
WORK OUT, I JUST TELL MOM.
(children screaming)
(children laughing)
THE FIRST EVENT,
THE KIDS CAME UP TO US.
THEY WERE HUGGING OUR LEGS
AND TELLING US IT WAS
THE GREATEST DAY
OF THEIR LIFE,
AND AT THAT POINT, WE KNEW
WE WERE ON TO SOMETHING.
GAMES2U HAS OVER
140 FRANCHISE TERRITORIES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW.
FRANCHISEES ARE THRIVING,
DOING FANTASTIC.
THIS IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE SHARKS TO COME IN
AND INVEST
IN AN AMAZING, GROWING BRAND.
(children screaming)
OH, BOY.
THEY'RE ON TO YOU, KEVIN. RUN.
I'M SOLD.
THAT'S COOL.
GAMES2U HAS
SPECIALIZED VEHICLES.
INSIDE OF OUR VEHICLES,
WE'VE GOT 4?D MOVIE THEATERS
AND MOBILE VIDEO GAME THEATERS.
WE HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OTHER CRAZY, FUN STUFF??
THINGS LIKE BOOGER WARS.
YES, BOOGER WARS.
AND Ubot,
WHERE YOU BECOME THE ROBOT.
NOW OUR COMPANY IS SET UP
AS A FRANCHISING ORGANIZATION.
TODAY WE HAVE
OVER 140 FRANCHISE TERRITORIES
SOLD IN 28 STATES,
AND WE DO OVER 2,000 PARTIES
AND EVENTS EACH AND EVERY MONTH.
ANYBODY WANT TO TAKE A SPIN
IN THE Ubot?
YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
HOP ON IN. IT'S GOT
AN ADJUSTABLE PLATFORM,
SO IT ADJUSTS
TO ANY HEIGHT, AND??
ARE YOU CALLING ME SHORT?
(laughs)
AND WHEN YOU TALK, IT'S GOT
VOICE MODULATION, AS YOU SEE.
(normal voice)
OH, IT'S EASY TO USE.
THE ARMS ALSO SHOOT NERF BALLS,
SO EVERYBODY DUCK.
(lasers firing)
(Daymond and Barbara laugh)
(sharks laugh)
WELL DONE. WELL DONE.
(normal voice) I LIKE IT. IT'S
FUN. DID YOU GUYS MAKE THIS?
WE DID.
IT'S A PATENTED PRODUCT.
YOU INVENTED THIS,
THIS WHOLE THING?
YES, SIR.
WOW. IT KINDA REMINDS ME
OF DAYMOND??SHORT, STOCKY.
(laughs)
LITTLE BIT.
OKAY. HUMOR ME. YOU'D BETTER
HAVE SOME FANTASTIC SALES.
(laughs) AND WE DO.
LAST YEAR WE DID
$3.5 MILLION IN GROSS SALES.
THIS YEAR WE'RE UP 65%.
WE'RE TRACKING FOR $5 MILLION
IN TOP LINE SALES.
MM.
I REALLY WANNA KNOW
WHAT BOOGER WARS IS.
(chuckles)
BOOGER WARS IS A GREAT GAME.
IT'S BASICALLY A CROSS BETWEEN
CAPTURE THE FLAG AND DODGEBALL.
IF YOU GET BOOGERED,
YOU'RE OUT.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
THESE VESTS OVER HERE.
BOOGERS GET THROWN. THEY STICK,
YOU'RE BOOGERED, YOU'RE OUT.
(rips Velcro)
IT'S A SIMPLE GAME,
BUT IT IS A TON OF FUN.
IS THIS
ONE OF YOUR CREATIONS?
IT IS.
IT'S A PATENTED PRODUCT.
PATENTED PRODUCT.
SO IF WE INVEST
IN THE COMPANY,
ARE WE OWNERS ON
ALL THE PATENTS AS WELL?
ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE
SIX PATENTS CURRENTLY...
WE HAVE TEN TRADEMARKS.
AND GAMES2U HAS
SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT JUST A FEW HERE TODAY.
WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF OTHER UNIQUE PRODUCTS.
WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE
CREATING NEW THINGS.
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT??
OUR FRANCHISEES ARE
WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.
WILDLY SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISEES
COUPLED WITH
HUGE CONSUMER DEMAND??THAT'S
WHAT MAKES A WINNING FORMULA
FOR A FRANCHISING ORGANIZATION,
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.
ARE THEY <i>YOUR</i> SALES,
INCLUDING THE FRANCHISEE SALES?
NO, SIR. THOSE ARE PURELY
OUR SALES. CORPORATE.
SO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS,
YOU SELL THE LICENSE
TO THE FRANCHISEES,
AND THEY SELL
THEIR OWN STUFF?
CORRECT.
RIGHT. A FRANCHISEE??
WHEN THEY INVEST,
THEY GET A PROTECTED TERRITORY.
THEY GET A SPECIALIZED VEHICLE
LIKE YOU SEE. THEY GET
A VAST ARRAY OF OUR EQUIPMENT.
(O'Leary) LET'S WALK THROUGH
THE FRANCHISEE MODEL.
I CALL YOU UP
FROM DES MOINES, IOWA.
WHAT DO I PAY YOU?
APPROXIMATELY $150,000.
AND WHAT DO I PAY ONGOING?
6% ROYALTY
WITH A $1,000 MINIMUM.
PER MONTH?
PER MONTH, CORRECT.
HAS ANY FRANCHISEE FAILED?
ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE
A FEW FAILURES IN THE SYSTEM,
AS ANY FRANCHISE SYSTEM DOES,
BUT OURS ARE MINISCULE.
OKAY, LET'S??LET'S GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT,
AND LET'S GO BACK TO THE VALUE,
'CAUSE IN THE END,
IT'S JUST ABOUT MONEY. LOVE
KIDS, BUT THIS IS ABOUT MONEY.
WERE YOU MAKING MONEY?
YES, SIR.
WE WERE PROFITABLE
LAST YEAR.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE
AFTER TAXES?
LAST YEAR WE NETTED $125,000
ON JUST OVER $3 MILLION.
AND YOU WANT ME TO PAY YOU
$5 MILLION FOR THAT?
BECAUSE, AGAIN, THIS IS NOT
A SHORT?TERM PLAY FOR US.
WE HAVE BUILT OUT
AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN
SUPPORT A SYSTEM FIVE TO TEN
TIMES THE SIZE OF THIS COMPANY.
BUT YOU'RE VALUATING IT
AT $5 MILLION.
CORRECT.
OKAY, BUT WHY WAS THE PROFIT SO
LOW? IT DOESN'T ADD UP FOR ME.
THE INITIAL MILLION DOLLARS THAT
A HANDFUL OF ANGEL INVESTORS
AND US PUT INTO THIS COMPANY
WAS TO GET IT TO THIS POINT.
WE'RE
AT THE TIPPING POINT NOW.
(Robert) SO YOU TOOK
OUTSIDE MONEY IN.
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO MAKE MONEY
UNLESS YOU DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT,
WHICH IS A SUNK COST FOR YOU
THAT YOU CAN'T GET BACK
FROM THE FRANCHISEES.
I HAVE AN ISSUE
WITH THAT MODEL.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER, OKAY?
LET'S START WITH THIS.
I'M GONNA BE REALISTIC
AND DEAL IN THE REAL WORLD.
YOU'RE OFF IN THE FANTASY LAND
WITH THE ROBOT.
I'M BACK HERE ON EARTH.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A FULL PREMIUM ON THIS THING
AND SAY IT'S WORTH
A MILLION BUCKS.
HOWEVER, I NEED CONTROL, SO I'M
GONNA GIVE YOU $500,000 FOR 51%.
WELL, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD JUSTIFY
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO US.
YOU ONLY MADE $125,000.
TODAY WE HAVE
A MASSIVE CONSUMER DEMAND.
WE HAVE A 99.9%
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION RATING.
WE HAVE SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISEES
THAT ARE EXPANDING.
WE HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL THAT
WORKS ON A CORPORATE LEVEL
THAT'S PROFITABLE.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU BLINDFOLDED ME
RIGHT NOW, THAT'S THE SAME PITCH
I GOT ALL MORNING FROM
TEN GUYS. SAME STORY??
"THE FUTURE'S SO BRIGHT, I GOTTA
WEAR SHADES, AND I GOT A ROBOT."
ALL YOU GOT IS
$125,000 CASH.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT'S <i>REAL</i> TO ME.
