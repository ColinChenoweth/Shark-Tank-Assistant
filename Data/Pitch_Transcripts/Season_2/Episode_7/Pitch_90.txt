I'M ANDY HUMPHREY,
AND MY COMPANY IS ECOMOWERS.
I'M SEEKING $90,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
I BROUGHT WITH ME
A LAWN MOWER.
NOW THIS LAWN MOWER
IS JUST LIKE
THE LAWN MOWER THAT MOST
AMERICANS HAVE IN THEIR GARAGE.
IT'S HEAVY, IT'S DIRTY,
IT'S LOUD,
AND IT'S DANGEROUS.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THE BLADES ON THIS LAWN MOWER
I?I'M??I'M
TOTALLY LOST HERE.
DAYMOND IS BASICALLY SAYING
ANDY'S BAIT AND SWITCHING.
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
YEAH. HEY, GUYS, WE'RE GONNA
REDUCE THE EMISSIONS ON CARS
BECAUSE I'VE INVENTED
A BICYCLE.
(Robert) OKAY.
BUT, ANDY, ANSWER THAT.
YEAH. SO THERE'S ROUGHLY
HALF A MILLION PUSH MOWERS SOLD.
HALF A MILLION?
ALL THOSE MOWERS REQUIRE
SHARPENING AND THEY'RE HARDER
TO PUSH AND THEY'RE??
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING
YOU'RE BUILDING A BETTER BIKE.
REALLY, THE THING THAT MAKES
THIS DIFFERENT??AND STOP ME
IF I'M WRONG??IS THAT
YOU DON'T NEED TO SHARPEN IT.
THAT'S CORRECT.
AND WE KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT NO OTHER, UH, LAWN MOWER
HAS THAT ABILITY?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR A FACT.
WELL, WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM??
ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHARPEN THE BLADES?
UH, CURRENTLY IN THE U. S.,
THAT??YES.
THERE'S??THERE'S
SOME GERMAN PRODUCTS
AND SOME PRODUCTS IN EUROPE.
UM...
SO THE REAL VALUE
IN THIS BUSINESS
IS NOT THE FACT THAT
IT DOESN'T NEED SHARPENING.
THIS IS A WAY FOR US
TO CREATE,
UH, A NAME AND AS?ASSIMILATION
WITH A BRAND.
THIS IS A BRANDING PLATE.
FORGET THE MOWERS.
IT'S A BRANDING PLATE.
RIGHT. SO??SO I STARTED
THIS BUSINESS, UM,
AS AN ONLINE STORE, RIGHT,
'CAUSE I WANTED TO??
I WANTED TO MAKE MONEY
FROM DAY ONE.
AND SO WHAT I DID IS I STARTED
RETAILING ALL THE OLD,
YOU KNOW, THE PUSH MOWERS THAT
ARE OUT THERE ON THE MARKET,
ANDY, WHY??WHY CAN'T
THE BIG GUY IN THAT SPACE
REBRAND HIS PRODUCT
AS THE "GREEN?CUT MOWER"
OR THE "BABY SEAL MOWER"
OR THE "FRIENDLY MOWER"
AND COMPETE WITH YOU?
BECAUSE THE ECOMOWER??THAT'S
WHAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH.
I WANT TO SEARCH
FOR AN ECO?FRIENDLY LAWN MOWER.
ARE THERE
ECO?FRIENDLY LAWN MOWERS?
ECO?FRIENDLY LAWN MOWER IS??IS
WHAT PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH.
YOU BUILT THAT MOWER
RIGHT THERE?
THIS IS A PROTOTYPE.
I DIDN'T BUILD THIS MYSELF.
I HAD A FACTORY
WORKING ON IT.
SO YOU DID EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.
YOU WENT TO A MANUFACTURER,
BASICALLY PUT YOUR BRAND
ON SOMEBODY'S MANUFACTURING??
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET ME??LET ME??
(Kevin) YOU'RE IN.
NO. I'M GONNA DO THIS.
I'M GONNA CREATE A COMPANY
CALLED GREEN MOWERS,
AND I SWEAR TO YOU,
FOR $450,000,
I KNOW A GUY IN THE 'HOOD
WHO WILL SHARPEN
EVERYBODY'S MOWER
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
(Kevin and Jeff laugh)
MAN, I R??I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE
COMING IN HERE TO JOKE.
BUT, ANDY, YOUR PRESENTATION WAS
A JOKE, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.
IT GOT YOUR ATTENTION,
THOUGH, RIGHT?
I AM OUT.
CAN I SAY ONE MORE THING?
HALF THE PEOPLE??NOT HALF??
BUT A HIGH PERCENTAGE
OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
THAT BUY THESE MOWERS
DO IT 'CAUSE YOU BURN
OVER 400 CALORIES AN HOUR.
THERE'S THIS WHOLE SECTION
OF THE MARKET
THAT WANTS TO MOW THE LAWN
TO STAY HEALTHY AND STAY FIT
BUT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE'S MOWER.
THE VALUE IS
IN THE NAME "ECOMOWER."
IT'S IN THE NAME.
I?I THINK THE PRESENTATION
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT
"I'VE LICENSED IT TO THE BIGGEST
MANUFACTURER IN THIS MARKET
AND THAT MARKET," AND WE'RE
GONNA GET SOMETHING FOR IT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD WORK,
BUT FOR ME,
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TODAY.
I'M OUT.
YOU'RE OUT.
(man) BARBARA?
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH
CONFIDENCE IN THE NAME,
AND I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE ENORMOUS COMPETITION,
SO I'M OUT.
I THINK YOU'VE PROVEN
THAT YOU'RE A SUCCESSFUL
ONLINE RETAILER OF MOWERS.
NOW YOU WANNA BECOME
A MANUFACTURER AND BRAND THEM.
I'M CONFUSED AND NOT
THAT INTERESTED. I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, I?I MEAN,
I CAN SEE, IN THE FUTURE,
MORE PEOPLE DOING THIS,
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OUT HERE
WITH SMALL LAWNS.
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT THE NAME,
AND I THINK IT'S A COOL NAME.
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ONE OF THEM.
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S BETTER
THAN THE ONES
THAT I HAVE BEEN SELLING.
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BETTER
THAN THE OTHER ONES,
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T BRING
ONE OF THE OTHER ONES HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS??
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL??
YOU ARE ALL
ON THE SAME PAGE??
IF I COULD'VE DONE ONE THING
BETTER, WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
NOT COME HERE.
DON'T ASK ME TO INVEST
IN A PRODUCT
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ONE OF.
YOU CREATED A BRAND,
YOU PUT THAT BRAND
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S MOWER,
AND YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ONE YET.
HE HAS NOT SOLD ONE.
ANDY, I WOULD SAY
YOUR PRESENTATION
MET WITH LIMITED SUCCESS.
(Robert laughs)
I DON'T CARE IF YOU GUYS
AREN'T ECO?PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A WHOLE
SECTION OF AMERICA??
OH, NOBODY'S MORE ECO
THAN ME.
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.
ANDY, ANOTHER PIECE
OF ADVICE??
DON'T INSULT THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE ASKING MONEY FROM.
NEVER A GOOD APPROACH.
I THINK WE'RE ALL ECO,
UH, CONSCIOUS HERE.
(Kevin) ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
(mouths words)
WE'RE GONNA ELIMINATE
EMISSIONS
BY SELLING WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SELLING FOR YEARS,
EVEN BEFORE EMISSIONS STARTED.
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT "OH, WELL,
YOU'RE NOT ECO?FRIENDLY"
BECAUSE I DON'T BUY YOUR THING.
THAT WASN'T COOL.
THAT WAS HIM MAKING AN EXCUSE
FOR HIMSELF.
YEAH, I KINDA LIKED HIM UP TILL
THAT POINT. LIKE, REALLY?
THE NEXT TIME
ONE OF THE SHARKS,
UH, WAKES UP IN THE MORNING??
THE EARLY MORNING??
TO THE SOUND
OF HIS NEIGHBOR'S LAWN MOWER,
HE'S REALLY GONNA BE WISHING
HE HAD THEM USING ECOMOWERS.
