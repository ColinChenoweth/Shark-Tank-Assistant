MY NAME IS DAVID PIKOFF,
AND THIS IS MY BROTHER STUART.
WE'RE FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS.
TOGETHER, WE'RE
THE COFOUNDERS OF GAMES2U.
SO THERE WAS A POINT
AT WHICH I WAS PUTTING TOGETHER
MY SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AT HOME,
AND I REALIZED THERE WAS
NOTHING NEW SINCE WE WERE KIDS.
IT WAS BOUNCE HOUSES,
PETTING ZOOS, MAGICIANS??
ALL THAT SAME OLD BORING STUFF,
SO WE SET OUT
TO CHANGE ALL THAT.
WE HAVE THE MOST UNIQUE
MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY
ON THE PLANET. ONE OF THE BIG
REASONS WHY IS THE MAGIC
THAT HAPPENS RIGHT HERE
IN THE FUN FACTORY.
COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU.
HIT IT, BOYS.
(laughs) HERE WE GO.
(David) WE ARE THE FIRST
AND ONLY MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANY OF ITS KIND.
(Stuart) BASICALLY,
HI. I'M STUART PIKOFF.
THIS IS MY BROTHER DAVID.
TOGETHER WE'RE
THE COFOUNDERS OF GAMES2U.
WE'RE HERE TODAY SEEKING
A $500,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN GAMES2U.
(David, normal voice) MY BROTHER
AND I ARE KIDS AT HEART.
THREE YEARS AGO,
WE STARTED GAMES2U,
THE FIRST AND ONLY
NATIONALLY BRANDED
MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY
OF ITS KIND.
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
STUART.
I ASK YOU TO COME TO MY HOUSE
FOR MY KID'S BIRTHDAY.
WHAT DOES THAT COST?
TYPICAL EVENT AT A HOME BIRTHDAY
PARTY IS GONNA BE $300 TO $400.
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF OF
ENTERTAINMENT BY THE FRANCHISE.
THE MORE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS
THE FRANCHISES HAVE
IS THE CORPORATE??
CORPORATE TEAM?BUILDING EVENTS,
THE SCHOOL FUND?RAISERS.
SO WHAT??WHAT DOES THAT COST
A CORPORATION TO HIRE YOU?
THEY'RE GONNA SPEND UP TO A FEW
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN EVENT.
YOU PUT
A VALUE OF YOUR BUSINESS
BY ASKING ME
FOR $500,000 FOR 10%.
YOU'RE TELLING ME
IT'S WORTH $5 MILLION.
YES, SIR.
DAVID,
YOUR REVE??YOUR SALES??
(Stuart) CORRECT.
YOU TOOK A MILLION DOLLARS
IN CASH.
(Stuart and David) CORRECT.
YOU'RE ASKING
FOR A MULTIPLE.
YES, SIR.
A MULTIPLIER OF VALUE,
LET'S CALL IT THAT.
YOU'RE MAKING $125,000
FREE CASH. YOU WANT $5 MILLION.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
LOVE THE KIDS, LOVE THE BOOGERS,
LOVE THE BLASTING MASTER,
WHATEVER,
BUT THIS IS ABOUT MONEY.
RIGHT.
I THINK THIS IS
A REAL BUSINESS.
I THINK
THE REAL FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS??
IT'S THE NUMBER.
(Stuart) WE WERE THE 21st
FASTEST?GROWING FRANCHISE
LAST YEAR IN THE COUNTRY.
WE LAUNCHED THIS BUSINESS
IN THE WORST ECONOMY
THE U. S. HAS EVER SEEN.
BUT WHY WOULD YOU COME HERE
WITH A NUMBER LIKE THAT?
YOU??YOU??YOU BASICALLY SAY THAT
YOU NEED STRATEGIC PARTNERS.
MM?HMM.
WE DO.
BUT YOU WANT TO OVERCHARGE US
AND THEN PUT US TO WORK?
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK IS
REASONABLE?
WELL, MY TIME ALONE TO WORK
ON THIS PROJECT IS WORTH
THE WHOLE COMPANY.
AND YOU'RE TAKING ALL
THE PATENTS INTO CONSIDERATION?
EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING
COMES HOME TO DADDY.
DAVID, THE PROBLEM IS,
THE ECONOMY'S REALLY HARD.
YES, SIR.
I BUY THE DEVELOPMENT COST
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN,
BUT $125,000??
REALLY, THE??THE BUSINESS,
ON A PURE MONEY BASIS,
ISN'T WORTH ANYWHERE CLOSE
TO $5 MILLION.
I CAN'T GET OVER THE NUMBER,
AND I CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT
THAT IF I HAVE TO LAY OUT
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
OF MY HARD?EARNED MONEY
AND ONLY GET 10%,
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO
TO WORK,
THE NUMBER JUST DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME. I'M OUT.
MY OWN FEELING ON THIS IS,
IF YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
CREATE NEW PRODUCT,
WHICH IS EXPENSIVE TO DO,
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GONNA GET AHEAD
OF THE BALL HERE, SO I'M OUT.
HEY, I ADMIRE YOU. YOU'VE MADE
MONEY OFF OF BOOGERS.
I'VE MADE 'EM
OFF OF FART JOKES.
(Barbara laughs)
I'M NOT THROWING
ANY DARTS THERE.
I THINK TO SHELL OUT 400 BUCKS
FOR A KID'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,
IN THIS ECONOMY, I MEAN, IT'S??
IT'S AN EXTRA WHEN PEOPLE ARE
STRUGGLING TO PAY THE MORTGAGE
OR BUY GROCERIES, AND??
(David) BUT IF YOU THINK
ABOUT IT, IN THIS DAY AND AGE,
SOMEBODY MIGHT NOT GET THAT
NEW CAR, THEY MIGHT NOT GET
THAT NEW HOUSE OR TAKE
THAT VACATION, BUT THEY'RE NOT
GONNA CHEAT THEIR KID
OUT OF A BIRTHDAY PARTY.
SURE THEY ARE, IF THEY CAN'T
AFFORD THEIR MORTGAGE.
NO, NO.
MY DAD USED TO TURN ON
THE SPRINKLER...
(Daymond) YEAH. YEAH.
AND TELL US IT WAS
A WATER PARK. I MEAN...
(sharks laugh)
I THINK IT JUST TAKES TOO LONG
TO EVER GET YOUR MONEY BACK,
SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
I HOPE YOU MAKE A BILLION,
BUT I'M OUT.
DAVID, IT'S NOT WORTH
$5 MILLION. YOU KNOW THAT.
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT WE'RE NEGOTIABLE.
BUT TO COME OUT HERE
AND ASK ME TO VALUE THIS
AT $5 MILLION...
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALMOST AN INSULT.
(Robert) MY ISSUE IS,
STUART, WHAT'S
YOUR COUNTER TO HIM?
IS THAT THE ONLY OFFER
ON THE TABLE?
(O'Leary) I LOOKED
AT YOUR $125,000 OF CASH
THAT YOU GENERATED,
ALL RIGHT?
I GAVE YOU
A GENEROUS MULTIPLIER ON THAT
THAT TOOK THE VALUE
OF THIS BUSINESS,
NOT TO THE $5 MILLION
THAT <i>YOU</i> WANTED,
BUT TO THE $1 MILLION
THAT IT'S WORTH.
AND SO I'M WILLING TO GIVE
YOU $500,000 FOR 51%,
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY NEED ME
TO HELP YOU.
LISTEN, IT'S TIME
TO MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WE BLAST EVERYBODY
WITH NERF BALLS.
(Stuart and David laugh)
COME ON, GUYS.
BE REALISTIC.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET
ANY MONEY FROM A BANK.
LET'S BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.
OUR DECISION REALLY IS NOT
MONEY FROM A BANK.
IT'S A REASONABLE VALUATION THAT
WE CAN GET COMFORTABLE WITH
VERSUS CONTINUED ORGANIC GROWTH.
I THINK WE'RE DONE.
YOU SAID NO.
YOU LEAVE THE TANK,
WE DON'T MAKE A DEAL??
IT'S LIKE A MEMORY WIPE.
(imitates whoosh)
'CAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER GUY,
ANOTHER ROBOT, ANOTHER STORY,
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY,
AND I <i>WILL</i> GIVE THEM THE MONEY,
AND THEY WILL BECOME RICH.
IT WON'T BE A BRAND
LIKE GAMES2U.
THERE'S A MILLION STORIES
LIKE YOURS, MY FRIENDS.
THAT'S WHY BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS SO WONDERFUL.
EVERY DAY I OPEN THE DOOR,
AND THERE'S A NEW OPPORTUNITY.
TWO GUYS WITH A ROBOT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(Robert) THANKS, GUYS.
(Stuart) THERE WAS NO WAY
WE WERE WILLING TO GIVE UP
51% OF OUR COMPANY AND CONTROL
TO SOMEONE LIKE KEVIN O'LEARY.
HE DOESN'T HAVE??
HE DOESN'T SEE OUR VISION.
HE DOESN'T SEE
WHERE THIS COMPANY CAN GO
AND UNDERSTAND
THE POSSIBILITIES.
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
TO GIVE UP CONTROL
TO SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.
THEY REALLY SHOULD'VE DONE
THE DEAL.
THEY JUST WERE GREEDY.
I SHOULD OWN THIS ROBOT.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU LOOK LIKE THE ROBOT.
(laughs)
(sharks laugh)
