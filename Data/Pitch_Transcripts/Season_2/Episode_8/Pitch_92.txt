HELLO, MY NAME IS JEFF STROOPE.
I AM THE OWNER OF HyConn LLC.
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK
FOR AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000
FOR 40% EQUITY IN MY BUSINESS.
NOW LET'S SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT
THAT SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW
OR LOVE
LIVED IN A HOUSE
THAT CAUGHT ON FIRE,
WHERE YOU FROM, JEFF?
I'M FROM ARKANSAS.
(O'Leary) JEFF,
THE ONLY NEGATIVE TO YOUR STORY
IS YOU'RE SELLING
TO THE GOVERNMENT.
YOUR SECTOR'S UNDER STRESS
FOR BUDGET CUTS.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
ASSUMING THEY LIKED IT,
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD
THAT PARTICULAR FIREHOUSE
HAVE TO PUT OUT
TO BUY ENOUGH OF THEM
TO EQUIP
THEIR TYPICAL EQUIPMENT?
MOST FIRE DEPARTMENTS,
THE WAY I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT,
ARE GONNA AVERAGE
ABOUT 35 UNITS.
$7,000, ROUGHLY,
IS YOUR TYPICAL SALE,
IF YOU SAID
YOU SOLD TYPICALLY 35.
SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
(man speaks indistinctly)
(Robert) GOING ALONG THAT LINE??
NOBODY HAS BUDGET.
MM?HMM.
ISN'T THE REAL PLAY HERE, IF YOU
COULD GET FIRE DEPARTMENTS
JEFF, I LOVE THE DESIGN.
WHY CAN'T YOU USE IT
FOR... OIL PIPELINES?
OR WHY CAN'T YOU EVEN USE IT FOR
THE??THE HOSE I HAVE AT HOME?
'CAUSE I CAN NEVER SCREW IN
THAT STUPID HOSE AT HOME.
RIGHT. LIKE THAT ONE?
WHY'D YOU WAIT SO LONG
TO SHOW US THAT?
YEAH, NO KIDDING.
NOW THAT WILL BE MADE
OUT OF PLASTIC.
THIS IS PART OF THE SAME DEAL?
PART OF THE SAME THING.
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THAT?
THAT PATENT FALLS UNDER
THE SAME THING.
HAVE YOU TRIED TO SELL THIS?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
THE MAIN REASON WHY IS BECAUSE I
BEEN FOCUSING ON THE FIRE SIDE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET'S STOP.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE FIRE THING,
BUT YOU'RE REALIZING
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS
20 CENTS IS WAY TOO LOW.
JEFF, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
IN YOUR POCKETS?
NO, SIR. NO, I DON'T.
(O'Leary)
LET ME SEE THAT RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
(Mark) YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?
I LIKE THIS SO MUCH.
WHAT IF I OFFERED YOU
$1.25 MILLION
FOR YOUR COMPANY
PLUS A 3?YEAR
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
AT 100K PER YEAR
TO RUN THE SHOW?
JEFF, I FIND THIS KIND OF THING
DISTASTEFUL??
WATCHING A GREAT ENTREPRENEUR
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.
WAIT, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
WAIT A SECOND.
I THINK YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS FIRE ELEMENT
OF YOUR BUSINESS.
THAT'S WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
I JUST WANT THE GARDEN HOSE
PIECE, ALL RIGHT?
I'M GONNA PAY YOU $500,000
FOR 100% OF THAT,
JEFF, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MARK'S OFFER?
I WOULD WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS,
LONG?TERM PERCENTAGE.
OKAY.
UH, I WOULD WANT AT LEAST
7 1/2% ROYALTIES LONG?TERM.
I WAS GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER
ALONG THE LINE OF, UH,
MR. CUBAN, BUT THAT'S MORE
GENEROUS THAN I WAS GONNA BE,
AT $1.25 MILLION.
I WAS NOT AT $1.25 MILLION.
I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA LEAVE MY OFFER
EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO
CHANGE IT.
IF YOU GO TO THE DARK SIDE??
WHAT IS IT WITH
THIS "DARK SIDE" STUFF?
YOU'RE??THIS IS
THE ENLIGHTENED SIDE.
IT??IT DISTURBS ME IMMENSELY
TO WATCH YOU SUCK THE LIFE
OUT OF THIS MAN.
(Mark speaks indistinctly)
HE'S WORKED SO HARD
TO GET TO WHERE HE IS,
LET ME PUT IT
ON THE TABLE, JEFF.
$1.25 MILLION...
FOR 100% OF YOUR COMPANY??
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN GREED
LIKE THAT?
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE GREED.
3?YEAR EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.
SO YOU'RE MAKING $100,000
PER YEAR
FOR THREE YEARS MINIMUM,
IF YOU ACCEPT THAT, JEFF,
I WANT A MOMENT OF SILENCE
FOR WHAT DIED IN HERE TODAY.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
100%? YOU DON'T DO 100% DEALS.
(Mark speaks indistinctly)
THAT'S CRAZY.
BETWEEN THE TWO OFFERS...
MARK, I LIKE YOUR OFFER
A LOT BETTER.
I'LL ACCEPT IT.
WHOO!
(Barbara) YES!
THIS IS ONE SMART MAN,
ONE SMART MAN.
GOOD.
(Barbara) GOOD MOVE.
ALL RIGHT, PARTNER.
