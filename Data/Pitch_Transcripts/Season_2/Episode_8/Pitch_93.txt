I'M JASON...
AND I'M MIKE,
AND OUR COMPANY IS OrigAudio.
WE LOVE TO TRAVEL.
WE'RE TOTAL TRAVEL JUNKIES
AND HAVE BEEN ALL OVER
THE WORLD.
AND WE ALSO LOVE MUSIC.
AND THE GREAT THING IS,
OUR COMPANY COMBINES BOTH.
WE USE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
TO MAKE PORTABLE AUDIO PRODUCTS
THAT ARE PERFECT
FOR TAKING YOUR MUSIC ON THE GO.
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS
SINCE JUST AFTER COLLEGE,
AND A YEAR AGO
WE BECAME BUSINESS PARTNERS.
WE DON'T TAKE OURSELVES
TOO SERIOUSLY,
BUT WE TAKE OUR BUSINESS
<i>VERY</i> SERIOUSLY.
<i>VERY</i> SERIOUSLY.
MY NAME IS JASON LUCASH...
AND MY NAME IS
MIKE SZYMCZAK,
AND OUR COMPANY
IS OrigAudio.
WE ARE SEEKING
A $150,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 15% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
NOBODY LIKES TO TRAVEL
WITH BIG, BULKY SPEAKERS
IN THEIR SUITCASE.
BY THE TIME
YOU PACK THEM IN THERE,
YOU DON'T HAVE ROOM
FOR A PAIR OF SOCKS
OR LET ALONE
YOUR FAVORITE SWIMSUIT.
AW.
(sharks laugh)
NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE
THESE KINDS OF SACRIFICES
IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR MUSIC
ON THE ROAD WITH THEM,
AND THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE CREATED OrigAudio
AND WE ARE REVOLUTIONIZING
THE PORTABLE SPEAKER INDUSTRY.
OUR LATEST INVENTION
IS CALLED THE ROCK?IT.
UTILIZING VIBRATION
TECHNOLOGY,
WE CAN TURN ANYTHING??
YES, ANYTHING??INTO A SPEAKER.
MAYBE YOU WANNA HAVE
A LITTLE ROCK?IT IN THE MORNING.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
(music stops)
IT'S ACTUALLY
VIBRATION TECHNOLOGY.
IT'S A TRANSDUCER,
AND WHATEVER IT STICKS TO...
(music resumes)
IT TURNS THAT INTO A SPEAKER
BY UTILIZING SOUND MOVEMENT.
(music stops)
MAYBE YOU WANNA ROCK?IT
WHEN YOU'RE WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
(music resumes)
(music stops)
OR MAYBE YOU JUST WANT TO
REDUCE, REUSE, AND ROCK?IT.
(music resumes)
(music stops)
WOW.
THE BEST THING
WE'VE EVER HEARD IT ON??
UPSIDE?DOWN FISHING BOAT
IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. WE PUT IT
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. TURNED
THE WHOLE BOAT INTO A SPEAKER.
(laughs)
WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA ASK
HOW YOU KNEW THAT.
WE'VE??
WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.
(laughs)
SO THIS IS OUR FIRST PRODUCT
THAT WE CAME TO MARKET WITH??
FOLDING SPEAKERS??
HENCE THE NAME OrigAudio??
THE ORIGAMI OF AUDIO.
THEY COME FLAT LIKE SO. THEY'RE
MADE FROM RECYCLED MATERIAL.
THOSE ARE SPEAKERS?
YES. YOU FOLD THEM TOGETHER.
AND THE COOL THING ABOUT THEM,
THEY'RE ECO?FRIENDLY.
THEY'RE POWERED OFF YOUR iPod.
NO BATTERIES WHATSOEVER.
HOW DO THEY SOUND?
FOR THEIR SIZE,
THEY'RE QUITE GOOD.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR ONE YEAR,
AND WE HAVE $750,000
IN SALES.
WHOA.
SO, JASON, IF I BROKE UP
THAT $750,000, WOULD IT COME
FROM THAT DEVICE?
$500,000 ARE FROM
OUR FIRST PRODUCT,
THOSE FOLD?AND?PLAY
RECYCLED SPEAKERS.
THE OTHER $250,000 HAVE COME
FROM THE ROCK?IT.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT POCKET AUDIO
PIECE THAT YOU INITIALLY HAD,
HOW MUCH DOES
THAT RETAIL FOR?
$49.99.
WHY DO YOU NEED THE MONEY?
UH, WE NEED THE MONEY
FOR MORE EMPLOYEES,
PRODUCT FULFILLMENT,
UM, ACCOUNTING FEES.
RIGHT NOW, ALL OF OUR ORDERS
FOR SOMEONE
WHO ORDERED FROM OUR WEB SITE
ARE SHIPPED FROM MIKE'S GARAGE.
SO, JASON, THE $750,000
OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
RIGHT.
AND HOW DID YOU GET THAT?
THROUGH RETAIL?
OUR PRODUCT'S SOLD IN OVER
500 STORES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
AND WE'RE IN SOME OF
THE LARGEST HOME GOODS STORES,
SOME OF THE LARGEST
TEEN STORES,
AND WE DO A LOT
OF BUSINESS ONLINE.
$750,000. WHAT DID YOU NET?
OUR NET PROFIT
WAS $150,000.
(Mark) ON THE ROCK?IT?
(Barbara) DID YOU TAKE SALARIES?
DID EITHER OF YOU TAKE SALARIES?
NO, WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A DIME
OUT OF THE COMPANY AS OF YET.
SO YOU DIDN'T NET THAT BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T PAY YOURSELVES YET.
ON THE ROCK?IT??
IS IT YOUR TECHNOLOGY,
OR DID YOU LICENSE IT?
THE ROCK?IT IS ACTUALLY, UM,
IT'S PATENTED IN CHINA,
UM, THROUGH OUR FACTORY.
WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR
AGREEMENT WITH OUR FACTORY.
YOU HAVE A LICENSE RIGHT NOW
FROM A FACTORY IN CHINA.
CORRECT.
SO YOU DON'T MAKE THE PRODUCT,
YOU DISTRIBUTE IT.
WE DISTRIBUTE IT,
BUT WE ALSO AID
IN A LOT
OF THE MANUFACTURING.
BUT??BUT WHAT IS THAT AGREEMENT
WITH THAT LICENSE??
HOW LONG
DOES THAT LICENSE LAST?
FIVE YEARS.
SO FIVE YEARS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO
RENEW THAT LICENSE WITH THEM.
CORRECT.
HOW MUCH CASH
DO GUYS HAVE IN THERE?
WE'VE PUT IN $40,000,
INCLUDING A, UH,
$10,000 INVESTMENT,
ACTUALLY, FROM MY MOM,
WHICH I THINK
YOU CAN APPRECIATE AS WELL.
YAY, MOM!
(laughs)
(O'Leary) THERE'S A LOT OF GUYS
IN PORTABLE AUDIO.
THERE'S A LOT
OF DEVICES SIMILAR.
RIGHT.
BUT YOU'VE PUT A VALUE
OF A MILLION DOLLARS
ON YOUR BUSINESS,
YOU DON'T EVEN PAY YOURSELVES.
LET'S GET SERIOUS HERE. WHY
IS IT WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS?
WE'VE HAD $750,000 IN SALES
IN ONE YEAR, RIGHT?
YEAH, BUT IF IT'S
NOT PROFITABLE??
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT A BUSINESS
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MONEY??
(Daymond) IT'S ACTUALLY
IN THE NEGATIVE.
$150,000 PROFIT
FROM A $40,000 INVESTMENT.
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
COUNT THAT.
IF YOU DON'T PAY YOURSELF,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY.
YEAH, WE'RE AT THE POINT
WHERE WE WANT TO START
PAYING OURSELVES, AND??
I WOULD THINK YOU WERE AT
THE POINT WHERE YOU WANNA EAT.
(laughs)
BUT THIS IS STILL
A LICENSE FROM A FACTORY.
YES.
WHY, IF THIS TAKES OFF,
AND THEY CAN START MANUFACTURING
FOR EVERYBODY??
IT'S THEIR LICENSE ANYWAY,
IT'S THEIR PROPERTY??
WHY WOULDN'T THEY DO THAT?
YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALLY,
REALLY STRONG RELATIONSHIP
THAT WE STARTED
BEFORE OrigAudio??
THEY'LL THROW YOU UNDER A BUS
IN TWO SECONDS FOR MORE MONEY.
YOU KNOW, GUYS, I THINK??I THINK
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS DEAL IS,
IT'S IN
A VERY COMPETITIVE SPACE.
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
IS FIGHTING FOR SHELF SPACE.
THERE'S ALWAYS
THE NEXT NEW, HOT ITEM.
THE VALUE YOU WANT FOR YOUR
BUSINESS, THE MILLION DOLLARS
ON SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY MONEY??
LET'S BE SERIOUS??
IS A PROBLEM.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
DO YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE
THIS PRODUCT WHEN YOU SELL IT?
BECAUSE I WAS JUST LOOKING AT
THE BOX, AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE
I'D HAVE THE PATIENCE
TO READ IT AND GET HOW IT WORKS.
ONCE YOU SHOW IT,
IT COMES TO LIFE.
PART OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE
ASKING FOR FROM AN INVESTMENT,
WE WANT TO PUT POINT?OF?SALE
IN STORES TO HELP SELL PRODUCT.
THE BIGGEST SELLING CHANNEL
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS,
WE SELL A LOT
ON TELEVISION.
HOW DO YOU SELL
ON TELEVISION?
QVC IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST,
LARGEST RETAILERS.
YOU'VE BEEN ON QVC?
YES.
WERE YOU GONNA WAIT TILL
EVERYBODY WAS OUT
TO TELL US THAT?
WE WERE GONNA WAIT
TILL KEVIN WAS OUT.
WELL, WHAT A RELIEF.
TWO SIDES TO EVERYTHING,
RIGHT?
(Daymond) BOY IS GENIUS.
JASON, HOW DID YOU GET
ON QVC?
I MEAN, THIS STORY
GETS MORE AND MORE AMAZING.
THEY ACTUALLY SAW US.
WE WERE DEMONSTRATING
THE ROCK?IT AT THE TRADE SHOW.
THEY ASKED YOU
TO COME ON QVC?
YEAH, WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY
USUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
I LIKE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING
AND I LIKE THAT THE FACT
THAT YOU GUYS ARE DEEP INTO
THE TECHNOLOGY AND RECOGNIZE
THAT YOU HAVE TO STAY
AHEAD OF THE CURVE.
YES.
AND I'M A LITTLE BIT
<i>O'LEARIOUS</i> OF, UM...
(laughter)
YOUR VALUATION.
AND SO THAT CONCERNS ME.
AND, UM, YOU GUYS ARE SMART,
SO I'M SURE YOU CAME IN
READY AND WILLING
TO NEGOTIATE.
I WANT YOU TO COME BACK TO ME
WITH A PERCENTAGE THAT SAYS,
YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR YOUR 150K,
LET'S JUST GO TO WORK.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO EVEN
TALK TO THESE GUYS ANYMORE.
IF YOU COME BACK TO ME WITH
A NUMBER, I'LL SAY YES OR NO,
AND THEN YOU CAN TALK TO THEM.
I DON'T WANT TO TURN THIS
INTO A NEGOTIATION
WITH THE OTHER SHARKS.
HOW DOES THIS SOUND??
IF YOU JUST WANNA DEAL
WITH THEM AND NOT ME,
THEN I'LL JUST BOW OUT
RIGHT NOW.
WOW.
$150,000, TELL ME THE PERCENT,
I'LL SAY YES OR NO,
AND IF I SAY YES,
WE'RE DONE, RIGHT?
OR GO DEAL WITH THEM 'CAUSE I
DON'T WANNA PLAY ALL THE GAMES??
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU'RE' ASKING HIM??YOU'RE
ASKING HIM TO TAKE THAT OPTION
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW
AND IGNORE US.
YEP. YEP.
YOU'RE NOT A VERY NICE GUY.
YEP.
IT'S YOUR GAME TO PLAY, GUYS.
MARK, YOU'RE SAYING
DEAL WITH ME,
SCREW THE OTHER SHARKS,
THROW THEM UNDER THE BUS
BECAUSE I AM THE BEST AND MOST
WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING
BECAUSE I THROW CHAIRS
AT A BASKETBALL GAME.
NO, ACTUALLY, I'VE NEVER THROWN
A CHAIR AT A BASKETBALL GAME.
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME
BEING WONDERFUL.
NO, NO, I HAVE THAT TITLE,
THANK YOU.
IT'S ABOUT MAKING
A BUSINESS DECISION, RIGHT?
I'M GONNA PUT A CLOCK. YOU'VE
GOT A 24?SECOND SHOT CLOCK.
YOU COME BACK TO ME
WITH A NUMBER.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF
THERE'S A SHOT CLOCK VIOLATION,
YOU GUYS CAN DEAL
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.
FOR 15%.
(Jason) CORRECT.
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 15%.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED
MORE MONEY DOWN THE ROAD.
AND I'M GONNA BE THERE.
I LOVE THIS STORY.
I'LL INVEST IN YOU GUYS.
BUT WHAT I'LL ALSO BRING
TO THE TABLE IS
MY PARTNER IN NEW YORK
WHO OWNS "AS SEEN ON TV."
ON A TYPICAL COMMERCIAL,
HE TYPICALLY GENERATES
OVER $50 MILLION IN SALES.
OKAY, SO THREE DEALS
AND A 24?SECOND CLOCK
ON THE TABLE.
NO, THE 24?SECOND CLOCK EXPIRED
BECAUSE I SAID THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE 24?SECOND CLOCK??
SO HANG ON. YOU'RE OUT, CUBAN?
I'M OUT.
(O'Leary) I'M GONNA SUMMARIZE
THESE DEALS.
THE FIRST OFFER FROM ROBERT IS
EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAME IN FOR??
$150,000 FOR 15%.
BARBARA HAS OFFERED YOU
$150,000 FOR 25%.
AND ALSO THAT I HAVE
A PERFECT PARTNER FOR YOU
TO MAKE THIS A SLAM DUNK.
(O'Leary) DAYMOND WANTS
100% OF YOUR BUSINESS
FOR $300,000 CASH TO YOU.
AND MARK WANTS TO BULLY.
OH, BUT HANG ON. HE'S OUT.
(chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
(Jason) THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
MAN! I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
(Mark) CONGRATULATIONS.
(Robert) THANKS, GUYS. YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL.
(Jason) THANK YOU, MARK.
(Barbara) YOU KNOW,
I'M DISAPPOINTED, GUYS.
IN THE END, IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT
THE MONEY, ISN'T IT?
(Robert) YOU GUYS MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
THANK YOU.
WE NEVER KNOW WHICH WAY
IT'S GONNA GO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T THE ROSE GARDEN.
IT'S THE SHARK TANK.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETIMES
YOU GOTTA TAKE THE BITE
AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE THE CHUM.
