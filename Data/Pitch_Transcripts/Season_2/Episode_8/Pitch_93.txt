I'M JEFF STROOPE
AND I'M FROM CABOT, ARKANSAS,
AND I'M THE CREATOR OF HyConn.
I WORK FULL?TIME AS A CAPTAIN
IN THE FIRE BRIGADE
AND A MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR.
(alarm blaring)
COME ON, LET'S GO! WE GOTTA GO!
(siren wailing)
ONE DAY, I WAS OPERATING
THE TRUCK, AND I REALIZED
THAT IT WAS TAKING WAY TOO LONG
TO PROVIDE WATER
TO THE FIRE SCENE.
AND AFTER THAT, I DECIDED I
NEEDED TO COME UP WITH SOME WAY
TO FIX IT, AND THEN THAT'S WHEN
HyConn WAS DEVELOPED.
I WORK ON HyConn ON THE SIDE,
ON THE WEEKEND AND THE EVENINGS.
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE
LIKE IT.
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FIRES
THE SAME WAY FOR 100 YEARS.
MY PRODUCT
IS GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE
THE WAY YOU PROVIDE WATER
TO THE FIRE SCENE.
THE POTENTIAL HyConn
IS TO MAKE MILLIONS,
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
IT'S ABOUT SAVING LIVES,
AND THAT MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN ANYTHING.
MY PRODUCT IS READY
FOR MANUFACTURING,
AND NOW IS THE TIME
THAT I NEED A SHARK TO COME IN
AND HELP GET THE FINANCING
AVAILABLE FOR THIS PRODUCT.
I'VE INVESTED 11 YEARS
OF MY LIFE.
I CANNOT LET THIS FAIL.
AND THIS WILL SUCCEED.
HELLO, MY NAME IS JEFF STROOPE.
I AM THE OWNER OF HyConn LLC.
I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK
FOR AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000
FOR 40% EQUITY IN MY BUSINESS.
NOW LET'S SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT
THAT SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW
OR LOVE
LIVED IN A HOUSE
THAT CAUGHT ON FIRE,
AND THEY COULD'VE BEEN SAVED
IF ONLY FIREMEN COULD HAVE
GOTTEN WATER TO THE STRUCTURE
JUST MOMENTS SOONER. NOW I'VE
BEEN A FIREMAN FOR 15 YEARS.
I TRIED THINKING OF WAYS
TO SAVE TIME
IN SUPPLYING WATER
TO THE FIRE SCENE
BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MANY HOMES
AND AMERICAN DREAMS
BEING DESTROYED BY FIRE.
SO I NOW HAVE COME UP
WITH A SOLUTION??HyConn.
HyConn IS
THE WORLD'S FASTEST WAY
TO CONNECT AND DISCONNECT
FROM A HYDRANT.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW THAT'S DONE.
I HAVE TWO PROFESSIONAL FIREMEN,
GONNA HELP ME DEMONSTRATE THIS.
NOW DAMON IS ON THIS SIDE,
AND HE'S GONNA HELP ME
CONNECT THE HyConn WITH
A STANDARD HOSE TO THIS SIDE.
AND KEVIN IS ON THIS SIDE TO
CONNECT JUST A STANDARD HOSE,
WHICH IS THE WAY
IT'S DONE TODAY.
OKAY, GENTLEMEN,
LET'S BEGIN NOW.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE HyConn IS ALREADY CONNECTED.
IT'S READY
TO TURN THE WATER ON.
THE OTHER SIDE, WE'RE STILL
TRYING TO SCREW IT ON.
OKAY, NOW HE'S GOT IT TIGHT.
OKAY, NOW LET'S DISCONNECT
TO SHOW THE SPEED ON THAT.
OKAY, BEGIN.
YOU CAN SEE THE SPEED IT TAKES
TO DISCONNECT THE HyConn
VERSUS YOUR STANDARD HOSE
THAT'S BEING USED ACROSS
THE UNITED STATES TODAY.
AT A FIRE SCENE,
EVERY SECOND MATTERS.
YOUR STANDARD CONNECTIONS
CAN SOMETIMES TAKE
30 SECONDS OR MORE.
HyConn CAN BE DONE
IN LESS THAN 3 SECONDS
AND DISCONNECTED IN A SECOND.
NOW THERE'S
OVER 33,000 FIRE DEPARTMENTS
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.
NOW THERE'S MILLIONS TO BE MADE
AT THIS MARKET ALONE.
WHO'S READY
TO MAKE MILLIONS WITH ME?
WHERE YOU FROM, JEFF?
I'M FROM ARKANSAS.
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR
BASE DEPARTMENT WHERE YOU WORK?
WHAT??ARE??ARE THEY
A CUSTOMER?
THEY LOVE IT.
THEY??THEY WANNA USE 'EM.
THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE NOT USING 'EM YET
IS BECAUSE ME WORKING THERE,
THEY CAN'T BUY THEM
STRAIGHT FROM ME.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SELL THIS?
SO LET'S SAY IT WAS??
WHAT, 20 SECONDS DIFFERENCE.
IT WAS AN 8?SECOND DIFFERENCE
ON MY COUNT.
CAN I GO TO A FIRE DEPARTMENT
AND SAY,
"YOU'RE GONNA SAVE 8 SECONDS.
BUY THIS"?
DO YOU THINK THAT
THERE'S BUDGET FOR THIS?
I?I DO.
BASICALLY, THE LAST MONTH
IS WHEN I STARTED MAKING
MY SALES CALLS.
AND OUT OF 11 DEPARTMENTS
THAT I VISITED,
I'VE HAD FOUR
THAT'S GIVEN ME HARD P. O. s.
THE OTHER SIX ARE WORKING ON
GETTING THE PAPERWORK TOGETHER
TO GIVE ME THE P. O.
WHAT DID YOU SELL THEM FOR?
THIS SIZE HERE, THE SMALLER ONE,
IS SOLD FOR, UH, $215.
THE LARGER THAT GOES
ON THE STEAMER VALVE IS $385.
(O'Leary) JEFF,
THE ONLY NEGATIVE TO YOUR STORY
IS YOU'RE SELLING
TO THE GOVERNMENT.
YOUR SECTOR'S UNDER STRESS
FOR BUDGET CUTS.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
ASSUMING THEY LIKED IT,
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD
THAT PARTICULAR FIREHOUSE
HAVE TO PUT OUT
TO BUY ENOUGH OF THEM
TO EQUIP
THEIR TYPICAL EQUIPMENT?
MOST FIRE DEPARTMENTS,
THE WAY I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT,
ARE GONNA AVERAGE
ABOUT 35 UNITS.
$7,000, ROUGHLY,
IS YOUR TYPICAL SALE,
IF YOU SAID
YOU SOLD TYPICALLY 35.
SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
(man speaks indistinctly)
(Robert) GOING ALONG THAT LINE??
NOBODY HAS BUDGET.
MM?HMM.
ISN'T THE REAL PLAY HERE, IF YOU
COULD GET FIRE DEPARTMENTS
TO MANDATE THIS PRODUCT,
IF YOU COULD
GET MUNICIPALITIES TO SAY,
"YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS HOSE
'CAUSE IT SAVES LIVES."
RIGHT.
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
TO GET FIRE DEPARTMENTS
TO APPROVE IT THAT WAY?
WE'RE WORKING TOWARD THAT. WE
HAVE NOT GOT THAT APPROVAL YET.
ARE THERE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
THAT PROVIDE DIRECT PRODUCTS TO
FIRE STATIONS? LIKE THAT JACKET.
IS THERE A COMPANY
THAT DISTRIBUTES THAT DIRECTLY?
YES, THERE IS.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT?
YES, I HAVE.
AND WHAT HAVE THEY SAID TO YOU?
I WENT INTO THEM,
TRYING TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR THEM TO BUY THE PATENT.
AFTER THEY LOOKED AT IT,
THEY SAID THAT AT PRESENT TIME,
THEY WASN'T READY TO BUY IT,
SO THEY WANTED TO HELP ME
DISTRIBUTE THEM.
THEY WANNA PUT IT
IN THEIR PRODUCT LINE.
AND HOW MUCH CAPITAL DO YOU NEED
TO GET IT INTO DISTRIBUTION?
$500,000.
I CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT
THAT THE DISTRIBUTORS
WANT YOU TO TAKE ON
THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGE
OF MAKING THE PRODUCTS,
SO THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN IT
TO THAT EXTENT.
SO I'M OUT.
I KEEP WEIGHING
THAT 8 SECONDS SAVINGS,
PITCHING A MUNICIPALITY
AGAINST SPENDING $7,000,
AND I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA DO IT.
I'M OUT.
JEFF, I LOVE THE DESIGN.
WHY CAN'T YOU USE IT
FOR... OIL PIPELINES?
OR WHY CAN'T YOU EVEN USE IT FOR
THE??THE HOSE I HAVE AT HOME?
'CAUSE I CAN NEVER SCREW IN
THAT STUPID HOSE AT HOME.
RIGHT. LIKE THAT ONE?
WHY'D YOU WAIT SO LONG
TO SHOW US THAT?
YEAH, NO KIDDING.
NOW THAT WILL BE MADE
OUT OF PLASTIC.
THIS IS PART OF THE SAME DEAL?
PART OF THE SAME THING.
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THAT?
THAT PATENT FALLS UNDER
THE SAME THING.
HAVE YOU TRIED TO SELL THIS?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
THE MAIN REASON WHY IS BECAUSE I
BEEN FOCUSING ON THE FIRE SIDE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET'S STOP.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE FIRE THING,
BUT YOU'RE REALIZING
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS
TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY.
NOW ON THE OTHER HAND,
THERE ARE TWO OR THREE
HOSE MAKERS IN THE U. S.
THAT SUPPLY ALL THE BIG BOXES.
THEY'RE HUGE.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GO
TO THEM AND SAY,
"I HAVE A BETTER WAY
TO ATTACH YOUR GARDEN HOSE
TO EVERY HOME IN AMERICA"?
AND YOU CAN PAY ME 20 CENTS
AND YOU CAN MANUFACTURE
THIS YOURSELF.
THAT'S ONLY ONE CALL TO THEM.
I HAVEN'T WORKED ON IT??
LIKE I SAID, I HAVEN'T WORKED ON
THE HOUSEHOLD SIDE OF IT AT ALL
OTHER THAN MAKING A SAMPLE
TO SEE IF IT WOULD FUNCTION
LIKE THAT.
LET ME JUST TELL YOU,
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
20 CENTS IS WAY TOO LOW.
JEFF, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
IN YOUR POCKETS?
NO, SIR. NO, I DON'T.
(O'Leary)
LET ME SEE THAT RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
(Mark) YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?
I LIKE THIS SO MUCH.
WHAT IF I OFFERED YOU
$1.25 MILLION
FOR YOUR COMPANY
PLUS A 3?YEAR
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
AT 100K PER YEAR
TO RUN THE SHOW?
AND I'LL PAY YOU
A PERCENTAGE OF THE PROFITS
ONCE WE HIT CERTAIN HURDLES
THAT WE AGREE TO.
WAIT A SECOND. BEFORE YOU EVEN
CONSIDER THAT MADNESS...
JEFF, I FIND THIS KIND OF THING
DISTASTEFUL??
WATCHING A GREAT ENTREPRENEUR
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.
WAIT, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
WAIT A SECOND.
I THINK YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS FIRE ELEMENT
OF YOUR BUSINESS.
THAT'S WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
I JUST WANT THE GARDEN HOSE
PIECE, ALL RIGHT?
I'M GONNA PAY YOU $500,000
FOR 100% OF THAT,
AND I'LL PAY YOU BACK
A ROYALTY OF 3% IN PERPETUITY.
IF WE BECOME PARTNERS,
WHICH IS WHAT THIS WOULD BE,
YOU'RE SELLING OUT
FROM UNDERNEATH US
AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THE COMPANY,
AND SO WE DON'T WANT
TO GIVE THAT AWAY.
"WE"? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT "WE"?
MY PARTNER.
HE'S <i>MY</i> PARTNER.
I'M NOT TAKING EVERYTHING,
HIS WHOLE LIFE FROM HIM,
LIKE YOU ARE.
I'M NOT EITHER.
I'M PAYING HIM A SALARY.
IN ARKANSAS, $100,000
IS GOING TO GO A LONG WAY.
NO, YOU'RE SUCKING THE LIFE
OUT OF HIM.
JEFF, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MARK'S OFFER?
I WOULD WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS,
LONG?TERM PERCENTAGE.
OKAY.
UH, I WOULD WANT AT LEAST
7 1/2% ROYALTIES LONG?TERM.
I WAS GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER
ALONG THE LINE OF, UH,
MR. CUBAN, BUT THAT'S MORE
GENEROUS THAN I WAS GONNA BE,
AT $1.25 MILLION.
I WAS NOT AT $1.25 MILLION.
I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA LEAVE MY OFFER
EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO
CHANGE IT.
IF YOU GO TO THE DARK SIDE??
WHAT IS IT WITH
THIS "DARK SIDE" STUFF?
YOU'RE??THIS IS
THE ENLIGHTENED SIDE.
IT??IT DISTURBS ME IMMENSELY
TO WATCH YOU SUCK THE LIFE
OUT OF THIS MAN.
(Mark speaks indistinctly)
HE'S WORKED SO HARD
TO GET TO WHERE HE IS,
AND YOU'RE JUST TAKING IT
ALL AWAY FROM HIM.
THAT IS SUCH... BAHOOEY, RIGHT?
AND THAT'S THE MOST POLITE WORD
I CAN COME UP WITH.
BAHOOEY?
MY OFFER'S VERY SIMPLE.
I GIVE YOU $500,000
FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT
THE FIRE HOSE, FOR 5%.
IT GIVES YOU THE CASH YOU NEED
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.
IT LEAVES YOU FREE
FROM THE TYRANNY OF MR. CUBAN.
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE.
LET ME PUT IT
ON THE TABLE, JEFF.
$1.25 MILLION...
FOR 100% OF YOUR COMPANY??
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN GREED
LIKE THAT?
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE GREED.
3?YEAR EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.
SO YOU'RE MAKING $100,000
PER YEAR
FOR THREE YEARS MINIMUM,
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA
WORK TOGETHER FOREVER.
PLUS... PLUS,
7 1/2% ROYALTY
ON <i>EVERYTHING</i> SOLD.
IF YOU ACCEPT THAT, JEFF,
I WANT A MOMENT OF SILENCE
FOR WHAT DIED IN HERE TODAY.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
100%? YOU DON'T DO 100% DEALS.
(Mark speaks indistinctly)
THAT'S CRAZY.
BETWEEN THE TWO OFFERS...
MARK, I LIKE YOUR OFFER
A LOT BETTER.
I'LL ACCEPT IT.
WHOO!
(Barbara) YES!
THIS IS ONE SMART MAN,
ONE SMART MAN.
GOOD.
(Barbara) GOOD MOVE.
ALL RIGHT, PARTNER.
LET'S GO OUT AND SAVE SOME LIVES
AND MAKE SOME MONEY.
ABSOLUTELY.
CONGRATULATIONS. GOOD JOB, GUYS.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
GOOD JOB. THANKS FOR BEING
FIREMEN. APPRECIATE IT.
ALL RIGHT!
IT'S OFFENSIVE.
MARK, IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.
HE WENT RIGHT TO THE TOP
OF THAT OFFER RANGE
IMMEDIATELY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T THINK TWICE.
WHEN THIS COMPANY IS WORTH
$50 MILLION, $60 MILLION,
WE'RE NOT GONNA LOOK BACK
AND SAY, "BOY, I GAVE HIM
$1.25 MILLION. I SHOULD'VE
GIVEN HIM $1 MILLION."
YOU DON'T REALLY WANNA
NEGOTIATE ANY OF IT?
I DON'T NEED TO SAVE $50
WHEN I'M GONNA??WHEN I'M LOOKING
AT MAKING $50 MILLION.
WHEN CAN WE HAVE A MEETING?
'CAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES
I CAN SELL YOU.
IF??IF THEY'RE LIKE THAT,
I'LL BUY 'EM.
YOU KNOW, WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THAT SOMEONE
FROM A SMALL TOWN IN ARKANSAS
WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE
A $1.25 MILLION DEAL
WITH MARK CUBAN?
THIS IS JUST THE GREATEST.
