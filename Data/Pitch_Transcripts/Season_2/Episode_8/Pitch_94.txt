HEY, GUYS,
MY NAME'S JOHNSON BAILEY.
I'M HERE TO ASK FOR $50,000.
IN EXCHANGE, I'M WILLING
TO GIVE YOU 25% OF MY COMPANY.
A FEW YEARS AGO,
I WAS GONNA HAVE THE GUYS COME
OVER TO WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME,
BUT MY PLACE STUNK.
I HAD DIRTY CLOTHES,
OLD CHINESE FOOD.
SO I TRIED TO COME UP
WITH AN IDEA
THAT COULD MAKE THE HOUSE
SMELL GOOD BUT ALSO MANLY.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS, THOUGH,
WAS THAT ALL I HAD
NOW, JOHNSON, YOU CAN'T EAT
THIS WAX. HOW DO YOU LIVE?
WELL, MY WIFE WORKS
FULL?TIME, SO...
JOHNSON, I GOTTA ASK YOU, WHY?
I'M SITTING HERE THINKING,
HAS ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?
DON'T KILL HIM YET, ROBERT.
IT'S ACTUALLY??
NO, YOU??
NO, I WAS JUST WONDERING, MARK,
HAS??HAS HE GOTTEN
IN FRONT OF AN INVESTOR OR??
WHAT HE'S GOTTEN??
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HE'S GOTTEN
IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS.
SO YOU'VE GOT 'EM
IN THESE GIFT SHOPS
JOHNSON,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
YOU'RE KILLING ME, JOHNSON.
ON??ON ONE SIDE, I CAN SEE
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL VISION.
I?I SEE THE ATTACK DOG IN YOU
THAT JUST LOVES THIS
