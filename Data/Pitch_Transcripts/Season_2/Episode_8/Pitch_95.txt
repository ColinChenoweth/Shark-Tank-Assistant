HEY, GUYS,
MY NAME'S JOHNSON BAILEY.
I'M HERE TO ASK FOR $50,000.
IN EXCHANGE, I'M WILLING
TO GIVE YOU 25% OF MY COMPANY.
A FEW YEARS AGO,
I WAS GONNA HAVE THE GUYS COME
OVER TO WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME,
BUT MY PLACE STUNK.
I HAD DIRTY CLOTHES,
OLD CHINESE FOOD.
SO I TRIED TO COME UP
WITH AN IDEA
THAT COULD MAKE THE HOUSE
SMELL GOOD BUT ALSO MANLY.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS, THOUGH,
WAS THAT ALL I HAD
WAS, LIKE, A VANILLA LAVENDER
FROUFROU SCENTED CANDLE.
YOU KNOW,
THAT WASN'T GONNA WORK.
AND THAT'S WHEN I CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA
THAT WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE
THE CANDLE INDUSTRY FOREVER.
MAY I PRESENT TO YOU
THE ORIGINAL MAN CANDLE!
(laughs)
WE'RE GOT POT ROAST,
WE'VE GOT GOLF COURSE,
BARBECUE, FOOTBALL,
DRAFT BEER, POPCORN??
AWESOME MANLY FRAGRANCES.
OR SAY THERE'S SOMEONE
IN YOUR HOUSE
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HANG AROUND TOO LONG.
THE WORKING TITLE FOR THIS
CANDLE WAS "MOOCH BE GONE"
OR "MOTHER?IN?LAW BE GONE,"
BUT I DECIDED TO GO WITH
A TAMER CANDLE??THE FART CANDLE.
(sharks laugh)
YOU JUST LIGHT THAT CANDLE.
20 MINUTES,
I GUARANTEE YOU THEY'RE GONE.
(man) I BET.
(sharks laugh)
YOU CAN'T REALLY APPRECIATE
A MAN CANDLE, THOUGH,
JUST BY LOOKING AT IT.
YOU GOTTA SMELL IT.
SO I BROUGHT SOME FOR YOU TODAY.
FOR YOU??NEW CAR.
GIVE BARBARA THE FART.
DON'T GIVE ME THAT ONE.
(chuckles) BEACH BABE FOR YOU.
FREEDOM??ALL?AMERICAN CANDLE.
(Robert) OH, WOW.
THE BACON?SCENTED CANDLE.
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
HOW ABOUT A BASKETBALL?SCENTED
CANDLE? (laughs) IMAGINE THAT.
IMAGINE THAT, HUH?
NOW, JOHNSON, YOU CAN'T EAT
THIS WAX. HOW DO YOU LIVE?
WELL, MY WIFE WORKS
FULL?TIME, SO...
AND YOU DON'T WORK,
JUST DO CANDLES?
I DO CANDLES, YEAH.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
YOU GOT A SHOT HERE, RIGHT?
DON'T LET THESE GUYS
DRAG YOU DOWN.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
I'M IN??STILL IN COLLEGE.
I CAME UP WITH THIS, UM,
AS MY BUSINESS PLAN
FOR MY ENTREPRENEURSHIP CLASS.
DID YOU PUT ANY MONEY INTO THIS,
YOU AND YOUR WIFE?
WE HAVE. WE'VE PUT
RIGHT AROUND $40,000 INTO IT.
WHERE DO YOU MAKE THEM?
HOW ARE YOU MANUFACTURING THEM?
UM, I HANDPOUR THEM,
EVERY ONE OF THEM.
YOU WHAT?
YOU HANDPOUR 'EM?
I HANDPOUR THEM.
HE'S HANDPOURING EACH CANDLE
HIMSELF.
MM.
JOHNSON, I GOTTA ASK YOU, WHY?
I'M SITTING HERE THINKING,
HAS ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?
DON'T KILL HIM YET, ROBERT.
IT'S ACTUALLY??
NO, YOU??
NO, I WAS JUST WONDERING, MARK,
HAS??HAS HE GOTTEN
IN FRONT OF AN INVESTOR OR??
WHAT HE'S GOTTEN??
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HE'S GOTTEN
IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS.
SO YOU'VE GOT 'EM
IN THESE GIFT SHOPS
AND YOU'VE GOT 'EM
IN THE MOM?AND?POP SHOPS.
YOU KNOW, WHAT??WHAT IS
THE NORMAL REORDER PATTERN?
WELL, LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
OUR??OUR HIGH END, UM,
CARD AND GIFT CHAINS
THAT CARRY THE PRODUCT,
A LOT OF THOSE STORES,
YOU KNOW,
WE SEE SIX TO SEVEN REORDERS
A YEAR.
A REORDER SIX, SEVEN TIMES
A YEAR IS NOT A LOT.
YEAH. I MEAN, THAT'S NOTHING.
JOHNSON,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT PUTTING WAX IN A CAN
AND SELLING IT.
THIS FALLS INTO
A CATEGORY OF A PRODUCT
I CALL "CRAP FOR TOURISTS,"
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S BAD.
THE PET ROCK FELL INTO THAT
AND MADE SOMEBODY
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
A PET ROCK.
I THINK
IT'S AN INTERESTING TCHOTCHKE.
I CAN'T REALLY INVEST IN IT,
SO I'M OUT.
I THINK YOUR BEST GIMMICK THERE
IS THE FART CANDLE.
BUT, UM, THE BUSINESS
IS JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH.
I'M OUT.
THIS IS A SITUATION??
I REALLY CALL IT, UM,
A VITAMIN?C DEFICIENCY...
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE CASH,
CREDIT, OR ENOUGH CUSTOMERS.
I'M OUT.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS WILL MAKE
ANY MONEY. I'M OUT.
WHO'S LEFT? JUST ME?
YOU'RE KILLING ME, JOHNSON.
ON??ON ONE SIDE, I CAN SEE
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL VISION.
I?I SEE THE ATTACK DOG IN YOU
THAT JUST LOVES THIS
AND IS READY TO RUN WITH IT.
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE,
YOU'RE A SINGLE PRODUCT,
AND I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S REALLY A FULL COMPANY.
AND BECAUSE I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT
AS A FULL COMPANY,
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANKS, GUYS.
I APPRECIATE IT.
GOOD LUCK.
