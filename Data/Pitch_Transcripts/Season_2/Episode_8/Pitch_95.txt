HELLO,
MY NAME IS JULIE GOLDMAN.
JULIE, WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT A WEDDING
IS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MONEY.
THIS IS THE TIME TO HIT 'EM.
I DON'T WANNA GIVE 'EM
A CHEAP RUNNER.
I WANNA GET THE $500 TO $700
PROFIT ON EVERY WEDDING,
WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T LOOKING
AT WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING.
YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC BUSINESS
THAT MAKES PHENOMENAL MARGINS.
YOU'RE CAPTURING THE HIGH END.
YOU WANNA GO PLAY
IN THE TOILET BOWL WEDDING.
I DISAGREE. I WOULD NEVER
CONSIDER ANY WEDDING TO BE
I DISAGREE.
BUT LOOK, JULIE, WHAT??WHAT
THEY'RE IS, YOU HAVE A WEB SITE,
YOU HAVE ALL THIS EXCLUSIVITY.
BUT, JULIE, I?I??
THEY EXIST, AND THE FACT IS,
ON THE INTERNET
IT'S HARD TO GET THEM
TO KNOW WE EXIST.
WELL, BUT??BUT LOOK,
YOU WANNA TAKE ON
ALL THIS INCREMENTAL RISK.
LOWER MARGIN
BECAUSE IT'S RETAIL, RIGHT?
(Daymond) AND YOU KNOW WHY
SHE CAN'T SEE IT?
(Mark) AND, JULIE,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING THE BEST...
YOU'RE MISSING THE OBVIOUS,
JULIE.
YOU WANNA HAVE ALL THESE
RETAILERS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
JULIE, I WOULD RATHER HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL, PROFITABLE
$2 MILLION BUSINESS
TO MAYBE, <i>MAYBE</i> GET
TO $4 MILLION OR $5 MILLION.
I CAN'T SEE THIS SCALING
INTO A LARGE BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
TWO WORDS??I'M OUT.
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?
THANK GOODNESS WE'VE MET.
HERE'S WHY??
YOU NEED ME BADLY.
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $250,000...
FOR 51% OF YOUR BUSINESS.
THAT'S CONTROL.
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING WITHOUT CALLING ME
(Mark) EXACTLY WHAT, JULIE?
NONE OF YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY.
BUT I KNOW HOW TO MAKE MONEY.
LOOK, JULIE, YOU'VE MET ME??
THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE,
OTHER THAN WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED.
BUT WE'RE GONNA GET
INTO A FINANCIAL MARRIAGE.
