HELLO,
MY NAME IS JULIE GOLDMAN.
I AM THE FOUNDER AND C. E. O.
OF THE ORIGINAL RUNNER COMPANY.
I'M HERE TODAY
TO PRESENT MY BUSINESS
AND TO REQUEST
A $250,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 15% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I PERFECT
LIFE'S GRAND ENTRANCES,
AND I DO THIS
BECAUSE I'VE CREATED
THE WORLD'S FIRST
NON?SLIP FABRIC AISLE RUNNERS
FOR WEDDINGS
AND SPECIAL EVENTS.
WHEN I WAS PLANNING MY WEDDING,
I NEEDED AN AISLE RUNNER
TO COVER THE ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS
CARPETING IN THE CEREMONY VENUE.
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
BE REALLY EASY.
I WOULD JUST GO DOWN
TO MY LOCAL STORE
AND PICK UP AN AISLE RUNNER.
BUT WHEN I GOT THERE,
IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE LIKE
GOING TO A SUPERMARKET
BECAUSE MY CHOICES WERE
EITHER PAPER OR PLASTIC.
AND NEITHER OF THESE
ARE REALLY GREAT OPTIONS
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WEARING
STILETTO HEELS,
IT'S GONNA TEAR, RIP, BUNCH,
AND THERE GO
YOUR WEDDING PICTURES.
THERE WAS ACTUALLY
NOTHING ELSE ON THE MARKET
THAT WAS SAFE AND BEAUTIFUL.
I MADE MY OWN AISLE RUNNER,
AND THE ORIGINAL RUNNER COMPANY
WAS BORN.
MY VERY LOYAL WHOLESALE
AND CELEBRITY CLIENTELE
HAS RESULTED IN MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OF MY AISLE RUNNERS
BEING SOLD WORLDWIDE
THROUGH MY WEB SITE ALONE.
BUT THAT'S GONNA CHANGE TODAY
BECAUSE I'M PRESENTING TO YOU
THE WALK?SAFE AISLE RUNNER.
THIS IS OUR 50?FOOT
NON?SLIP FABRIC AISLE RUNNER
MASS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN RETAIL
STORES FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
AND THROUGH THOUSANDS
OF ONLINE WEDDING WEB SITES.
(man speaks indistinctly)
THEY'RE JUST
PLAIN WHITE RUNNERS,
WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR
AISLE RUNNER SOLD IN THE WORLD.
IN ADDITION, I'M INTRODUCING
FOR THE FIRST TIME
OUR HOME MONOGRAMMING KIT.
THIS IS GONNA ALLOW
THE DO?IT?YOURSELF BRIDE
TO CREATE A MONOGRAMMED AISLE
RUNNER JUST LIKE THIS AT HOME
FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE
THAT I CHARGE IN MY STUDIO.
WE THINK THESE TWO
NEW RETAIL?BASED OPTIONS
WILL MAKE MY BRAND MUCH MORE
ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE
TO THE MORE THAN
2 MILLION BRIDES
THAT ARE MARRIED IN THE U. S.
ALONE EACH YEAR.
SO IF YOU INVEST WITH
THE ORIGINAL RUNNER COMPANY,
WE'RE GONNA MAKE MILLIONS
TOGETHER.
WHAT'S THE TOTAL SALES
FOR BOTH BUSINESSES LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR WAS A DOWN ECONOMY,
AND WE SOLD $550,000.
ACTUALLY, BEFORE THE RECESSION,
WE WERE SELLING $800,000,
AND THIS YEAR WE'LL FINISH
ABOUT $650,000.
YOU'RE A GREAT INDICATOR
OF THE RECESSION COMING BACK.
NO, I'M A GREAT INDICATOR
OF REBUILDING MY BUSINESS
LAST YEAR BY MOVING IT
OUT OF NEW YORK CITY,
CUTTING MY RENT BY 80%,
REFORMATTING HOW I WAS PAYING
MY SALARY STRUCTURES,
AND INTRODUCING
THREE NEW LINES OF PRODUCTS.
WHAT DOES THAT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
THIS IS GONNA COST ME
$25 TO MAKE.
I'M GONNA SELL IT
TO THE RETAIL STORE FOR $37.50,
MAKING A 52% PROFIT ON IT.
THAT'S NOT THE CORRECT MARGIN.
WELL, THE MARGIN ON IT,
IT'S GONNA BE 33%??
IS THE PROFIT MARGIN ON IT.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
OKAY, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT DEPENDS
ON WHERE YOU'RE SELLING IT.
IN STORES
LIKE LARGE CRAFT STORES,
THAT MARGIN'S ACTUALLY
REALLY COMMON. IT'S MUCH LOWER.
NO, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH OUR SIDE OF THE BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST MAKE
A 60% MARGIN ON THAT THEN.
IF WE WERE TO ACTUALLY INVEST
MORE AND MAKE MORE OF THEM,
WE COULD DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN
SIGNIFICANTLY.
IS THIS PROPRIETARY?
SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THAT ONE
YOU WANNA MAKE OVER THERE?
WE MAKE THE ONLY NON?SLIP
FABRIC RUNNERS IN THE WORLD.
AND IF YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT
WANNA HAVE PAPER OR PLASTIC,
YOU HAVE TO GO BUY FABRIC,
HAVE IT HEMMED, AND MADE.
CAN YOUR COMPETITOR MAKE
THE SAME THING?
I DON'T HAVE ANY COMPETITORS
THAT ARE DOING THAT, NO.
SO YOU'RE SAYING NOBODY ELSE
MAKES RUNNERS BUT YOU?
NOT??MAKE NON?SLIP FABRIC
RUNNERS? NO. THE ONLY COMMER??
BUT CAN THEY MAKE NON?SLIP
IF THEY WANTED TO,
AFTER THEY SEE YOU DOING
SOMETHING THAT'S SUCCESSFUL?
BECAUSE YOU DO OR DON'T HAVE
A PATENT. CAN THEY MAKE IT?
NO, YOU CAN'T PATENT FABRIC,
JUST LIKE YOU COULDN'T PATENT
CLOTHING AND YOU MADE MILLIONS.
I'M ASKING
A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION.
CAN SOMEBODY ELSE MAKE
A NON?SLIP RUNNER
AFTER THEY SEE
THAT YOU ARE DOING WELL?
THEY COULD.
BUT I'M ALREADY DOING WELL.
OKAY.
I'M FIRST IN THE FIELD
AND VERY SUCCESSFUL
THAT'S ALL I'M??
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.
HOW IS THIS BUSINESS WORTH
$1.8 MILLION TODAY?
IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH
MORE THAN THAT.
I LOVE THAT ANSWER.
"IT'S WORTH MORE." OKAY.
YEAH, WELL, VALUATION CAN
ACTUALLY BE, OBVIOUSLY,
DETERMINED
IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS.
YOU CAN DO PROJECTED INCOMES.
YOU COULD DO CURRENT REVENUE.
IF YOU BASE IT EVEN
ON CURRENT REVENUE ALONE,
IF WE'RE MAKING $650,000
THIS YEAR, IF YOU'RE USING
A 3 TO 5 RATIO, IT FALLS
VERY NICELY IN THE $1.8.
AHA.
(mouths word)
THIS THING YOU'RE STANDING ON,
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST ME
FOR MY WEDDING?
OKAY, UM,
SO THAT'S A HIGHER END OF OUR
LINE. THIS IS A 75?FOOT RUNNER.
IT'S HANDPAINTED
AND HAND?CRYSTALED
AND HAND?GLITTERED.
THIS ONE EXACTLY AS YOU SEE HERE
WOULD BE ABOUT $750.
OKAY, SO AFTER ALL OF THAT COST,
WHAT'S YOUR MARGIN?
WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON THIS?
MY MARGIN ON THIS
IS ACTUALLY ABOUT 200%.
WOW.
MAKING $750 ON THIS,
I'M PAYING ABOUT $250
TO MAKE IT,
SO I'M MAKING ABOUT $500 ON IT.
I'M CONFUSED.
IF PEOPLE AT WEDDINGS
ARE SPENDING $750 FOR CUSTOM,
WHY A DROP DOWN
TO A $60 PRODUCT?
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
TRUTHFULLY, MY CURRENT CLIENTS
ARE SPENDING $50,000 OR MORE
ON THEIR WEDDING.
$50,000?
AND MORE. BUT THE AVERAGE
WEDDING IS $27,000,
AND THEY'RE NOT BUYING
THESE AISLE RUNNERS.
THEY CAN'T FIT IT
IN THEIR BUDGET.
JULIE, WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT A WEDDING
IS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MONEY.
THIS IS THE TIME TO HIT 'EM.
I DON'T WANNA GIVE 'EM
A CHEAP RUNNER.
I WANNA GET THE $500 TO $700
PROFIT ON EVERY WEDDING,
WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T LOOKING
AT WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING.
YOU'VE GOT A FANTASTIC BUSINESS
THAT MAKES PHENOMENAL MARGINS.
YOU'RE CAPTURING THE HIGH END.
YOU WANNA GO PLAY
IN THE TOILET BOWL WEDDING.
I DISAGREE. I WOULD NEVER
CONSIDER ANY WEDDING TO BE
A TOILET BOWL WEDDING,
AND I THINK MY BRIDES WOULD BE
HIGHLY OFFENDED
BY THAT COMMENT.
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE'S SAYING. THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE'S SAYING. WHAT HE'S SAYING IS
YOU DOMINATE A CATEGORY.
ADM SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
TO BE THE BEST IN A NICHE
THAN TRY TO GO OUT AND COMPETE
WITH ALL OTHER PRODUCTS.
AND SO YOU'RE TAKING ON RISK
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE,
RISK FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT,
AND RISK IN THIS RETAIL MARKET.
WHY? HOW MUCH??HOW MUCH??
IT'S A LOST OPPORTUNITY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
AND I CAN ANSWER THAT.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I DISAGREE
AND I CAN EXPLAIN WHY.
WELL, LET HER??LET HER??
LET HER ANSWER.
ACTUALLY, MOST CHURCHES
AND SYNAGOGUES
NO LONGER ALLOW AISLE RUNNERS
BECAUSE THE ONLY ONES THEY??
OOH! NEW INFORMATION!
BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE SEEN
THE PAPER AND PLASTIC ONES.
WHAT GENERALLY HAPPENS,
MY CLIENTS WILL REQUEST
FREE SWATCHES??
WHICH WE SEND OUT
AROUND THE WORLD??
AND THEY TAKE IT THERE,
AND WE GET PERMISSION.
WE'RE PERMITTED
IN LARGE CATHEDRALS
THAT ALLOW ANY OTHER
AISLE RUNNERS BUT MINE.
THE LIABILITY IS HUGE
WHY DO YOU WANNA GO RETAIL?
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
I DISAGREE.
BUT LOOK, JULIE, WHAT??WHAT
THEY'RE IS, YOU HAVE A WEB SITE,
YOU HAVE ALL THIS EXCLUSIVITY.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL
THE CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES,
"GO TO THE WEB SITE." INSTEAD??
BECAUSE THE CHURCHES
AREN'T BUYING THEM.
THE BRIDES ARE BUYING THEM.
THE BRIDES HAVE TO KNOW...
BUT, JULIE, I?I??
THEY EXIST, AND THE FACT IS,
ON THE INTERNET
IT'S HARD TO GET THEM
TO KNOW WE EXIST.
WELL, BUT??BUT LOOK,
YOU WANNA TAKE ON
ALL THIS INCREMENTAL RISK.
LOWER MARGIN
BECAUSE IT'S RETAIL, RIGHT?
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
33% MARGINS.
WAIT TILL THE STORES
START ASKING FOR INCENTIVES...
(speaks indistinctly)
IF SHE CAN'T SEE THAT HERSELF...
(Daymond) AND YOU KNOW WHY
SHE CAN'T SEE IT?
(Mark) AND, JULIE,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING THE BEST...
(Daymond and O'Leary
speaking indistinctly)
ENOUGH!
MY GOSH!
YOU'RE WORSE THAN WOMEN.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED ANYBODY HERE.
YOU GOT TO WHERE YOU WERE
ON YOUR OWN.
I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOUR STRATEGY,
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
YOU'RE MISSING THE OBVIOUS,
JULIE.
YOU WANNA HAVE ALL THESE
RETAILERS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR PRODUCTS
AND SELLING THEM.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SELL IT
NEARLY AS WELL AS YOU CAN.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
JULIE, I WOULD RATHER HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL, PROFITABLE
$2 MILLION BUSINESS
TO MAYBE, <i>MAYBE</i> GET
TO $4 MILLION OR $5 MILLION.
I CAN'T SEE THIS SCALING
INTO A LARGE BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
TWO WORDS??I'M OUT.
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?
THANK GOODNESS WE'VE MET.
HERE'S WHY??
YOU NEED ME BADLY.
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $250,000...
FOR 51% OF YOUR BUSINESS.
THAT'S CONTROL.
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING WITHOUT CALLING ME
'CAUSE I'M GONNA KEEP YOU
ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW
TO MAKE ME MONEY. BUT BECAUSE
YOU OWN 49%, YOU'LL GET RICH.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
MR. WONDERFUL.
HE'S SO APPEALING, ISN'T HE?
YOU NEED MY GUIDANCE
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTEN LOST.
I FIND THAT REALLY INTERESTING
FOR YOU TO SAY
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING IN
THIS BUSINESS FOR SEVEN YEARS.
I'M KNOWN AS THE AISLE GURU
AND BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT THE HECK I'M DOING.
I KNOW MY BUSINESS.
WELL, I KNOW??
(Mark) EXACTLY WHAT, JULIE?
NONE OF YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY.
BUT I KNOW HOW TO MAKE MONEY.
LOOK, JULIE, YOU'VE MET ME??
THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE,
OTHER THAN WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED.
BUT WE'RE GONNA GET
INTO A FINANCIAL MARRIAGE.
AND YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME.
BELIEVE ME.
MM. LOVING YOU ALREADY. (laughs)
I'M GONNA
KEEP YOU STRAIGHT AND NARROW.
OKAY.
YOU WILL NEVER
THINK ABOUT THIS AGAIN
OR EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
YOU HAVE TO WALK DOWN THE PATH
OF HIGH MARGIN RUNNER,
NOT THE TOILET BOWL WEDDING. I'M
GONNA KEEP YOU OUT OF THAT MESS
BECAUSE I'M GONNA OWN 51%
OF THE BUSINESS. YES OR NO?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
WHY?
TO BE FRANK, I WOULD NEVER
GIVE UP 51% OF MY BUSINESS.
YOU NEED TO GIVE UP 51%.
I ACTUALLY DON'T.
YOU NEED ME BADLY.
I TOOK AN IDEA
THAT DIDN'T EXIST,
I MADE THE WORLD KNOW
IT EXISTS.
I SHIP TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I'M MOVING INTO EUROPE
NEXT YEAR.
I'M THE VERA WANG
OF AISLE RUNNERS.
I DON'T NEED 51% OF MY BUSINESS
BEING TAKEN BY SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE WEDDING INDUSTRY.
I UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE MONEY.
THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO CARE ABOUT.
SO JUST COUNTER.
I'M COUNTERING BACK AT 15%.
I'M LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT,
NOT A FULL INVESTED PARTNER.
YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T WORTH
$1.8 MILLION.
I THINK IT IS.
TURN AROUND, GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU, TOO.
I COULDN'T GET
A WORD IN WITH THAT WOMAN.
WOULD <i>NEVER</i> GIVE HER CONTROL.
SHE WOULD EAT YOU UP
AND SPIT YOU OUT
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING TWICE.
I JUST TURNED DOWN
KEVIN O'LEARY'S OFFER
BECAUSE IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.
THERE WAS NO WAY
I WAS GONNA GIVE UP
51% CONTROL OF MY COMPANY
FOR $250,000
WHEN MY BUSINESS IS GONNA MAKE
$650,000 THIS YEAR.
THE MATH DIDN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.
