MY NAME IS KIM PREIS,
MY COMPANY IS SAMSON MARTIN,
AND I AM SEEKING $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15% EQUITY
IN MY BUSINESS.
A FEW YEARS AGO,
I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
BECAUSE ALL OF MY GIRLFRIENDS
WERE PREGNANT AT THE TIME,
AND THE OBVIOUS QUESTION
THAT THEY'RE ASKED IS
WHEN ARE YOU DUE?
SO I THOUGHT, HOW LOGICAL IT
WOULD BE TO PUT IT ON A T?SHIRT?
WE HAD LAUNCHED
WITH THE "DUE IN" TEE,
AND EXPANDED THE COLLECTION
TO VARIOUS OTHER EXECUTIONS.
I ORIGINALLY POSITIONED THE LINE
IN UPSCALE BOUTIQUES.
MY GOAL WAS REALLY TO ALIGN IT
WITH HIGHER?END BRANDS,
BUT DUE TO THE RECESSION,
THE BOUTIQUE BUSINESS
HAS BEEN HIT TREMENDOUSLY HARD.
I NEED TO REPOSITION THE BRAND
AND REALLY COME UP WITH A WAY
TO PRODUCE
A MORE ECONOMICAL COLLECTION
AND TAKE IT TO MASS RETAILERS.
THIS IS A PROVEN WINNER.
I'VE DONE TREMENDOUS SALES.
I HAVE GOTTEN TREMENDOUS PRESS.
I JUST NEED THE CONTACTS,
THE DOORS TO BE OPEN,
THE PROPER FINANCIAL INJECTION
TO REPOSITION THE BRAND
AND GROW IT FURTHER.
LET'S START
WITH THE SALES NUMBERS.
(Robert) YEAH.
LAST YEAR I DID $90,000
IN SALES. I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR 6 YEARS. I'VE DONE
A TOTAL OF $1.4 MILLION
OUT OF MY BASEMENT.
SO HAVE YOUR SALES GONE UP
AND THEN STARTED DROPPING?
YES.
SO WHAT WERE THE SALES
AT THEIR PEAK?
$400,000.
AND THEY DROPPED TO $90,000?
MM?HMM.
HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL THESE FOR?
UH, THEY RANGE.
THE TANK TOPS ARE
ANYWHERE BETWEEN $38 AND $42.
THE LONG SLEEVES ARE
ANYWHERE BETWEEN $55 AND $60.
CAN YOU STOP ANYBODY ELSE
FROM PUTTING THIS ON A T?SHIRT?
I HAVE A TRADEMARK ON "DUE IN."
THE WORDS "DUE IN"??
NO ONE ELSE COULD USE?
"DUE"??WHEN I LAUNCHED
THE LINE BACK IN '04,
I GOT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
PRESS, CELEBRITY RECOGNITION.
JENNIFER GARNER, ANGELINA JOLIE,
BRITNEY SPEARS.
KIM, YOU'RE A T?SHIRT COMPANY.
THE OBJECTIVE IS
TO SELL MORE T?SHIRTS, MAKE MORE
MONEY. WE ALL AGREE ON THAT.
YEAH. RIGHT.
YOU HAVE PICKED A SUBSEGMENT
OF A SUBSEGMENT.
IN OTHER WORDS,
I CAN'T SELL TO MEN.
THAT'S 50% OF THE MARKET GONE...
SURE.
BUT I CAN'T SELL
TO ALL WOMEN EITHER.
I CAN ONLY SELL
TO THE PREGNANT ONES. THAT'S IT.
6 MILLION.
OKAY, BUT I'M SAYING
IT'S VERY HARD
TO GET TO MY TARGET MARKET
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE PREGNANT
FOR ONLY NINE MONTHS.
(Robert) I LIKE THAT APPROACH.
I LIKE THE FACT
THAT YOU FOUND
A VERY NICHE MARKET.
THE BEAUTY
OF THE MATERNITY MARKET IS
YOU HAVE A NEW CUSTOMER
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE.
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT,
YOUR OLD CLOTHES DON'T FIT.
YOU'RE A FORCED CUSTOMER.
YES.
MY ISSUE IS NOT THE MARKET.
MY ISSUE IS YOU WERE HOT
A FEW YEARS AGO.
YOU'RE SAYING
SHE'S NOT HOT NOW?
KEVIN, MY MIND IS NOT
IN THE GUTTER LIKE YOURS.
OH.
I'M SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT
HER BUSINESS.
SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
OF COURSE,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.
BUT YOU HIT SALES OF $400,000,
RECESSION HIT,
AND THEN YOU KIND OF HIT BOTTOM.
CAN YOU BE HOT TWICE?
CAN THAT BABY BE BORN AGAIN?
ABSOLUTELY.
I KNOW I CAN DO IT AGAIN
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
THIS IS??THIS TOOK A GREAT DEAL
OF THOUGHT IN DEVELOPING.
A LOT OF THE MATERNITY T?SHIRTS
OUT THERE??
THEY'RE NOT FLATTERING
TO WOMEN.
THEY'RE NOT MAKING THEM
LOOK BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY.
WHEN I LAUNCHED THE LINE, IT WAS
ABOUT ESTABLISHING A BRAND AND??
WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK
YOU'VE DONE THERE?
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF SAMSON MARTIN.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S MY PROBLEM??
I CAN ONLY SELL IT
TO PEOPLE THAT ARE PREGNANT.
(Barbara) YOU SAID
YOU WANTED REPOSITIONING.
THAT MEANS YOU WANT TO MAKE
A CHEAPER?PRICED BRAND?
YES.
THEN LET'S SAY YOU DO.
THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH
THAT CHEAPER T?SHIRT?
I TAKE IT
TO A LARGER RETAILER.
I CAN'T RELY ON
THESE SMALLER BOUTIQUES TO??
FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH,
I CAN'T DO IT.
I'M THINKING TARGET.
I'M THINKING JCPenney,
I'M THINKING KOHL'S.
I'M THINKING buybuy BABY.
(Daymond) HAVE YOU TALKED
TO THEM?
I HAVE NOT.
(Robert) WHY?
I DON'T HAVE
THE PROPER CONTACTS.
YOU BUILT A BUSINESS.
YOU'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR ALL THIS TIME.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROPER...
YEAH.
YOU CAN'T PICK UP A PHONE
AND MAKE A CALL?
I HAVE MADE PHONE CALLS.
I HAVE NOT...
(Barbara) CONNECTED.
YOU WANT $50,000.
YES.
WHAT??WHERE YOU GONNA GO
WITH THAT?
THE MONEY WOULD BE
FOR MARKETING, PRODUCTION,
MANUFACTURING, AND TO
ESSENTIALLY FILL THE ORDERS.
YOU WOULD BE SPENDING THE MONEY
ON DEVELOPING
THIS NEW PRODUCT LINE...
YES.
FROM??FROM SCRATCH, REALLY.
YES. BUT IT??
DAYMOND, YOU'RE A BRAND GUY.
HOW HARD OR EASY IS IT
TO TAKE A BRAND
THAT'S DECLINING
AND MAKE IT HOT AGAIN?
A LOT OF THE CUSTOMERS NOW ARE
NOT BUYING AS MANY CLOTHES.
THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS IS
INCREASINGLY HARD AT THE MOMENT.
AND GETTING TO THOSE GUYS
SHE'S ASKING ABOUT GETTING TO??
THAT ARE DOING $4 BILLION
AND $5 BILLION.
THE BIG BRANDS THAT WE ALL KNOW
ARE TRYING TO GET SOME BECAUSE
THEY'RE STUCK ON INVENTORY
AND THEY HAVE TO OFFLOAD IT.
SO...
WELL, YOU'RE MR. POSITIVE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BRAND
HAS SUFFERED DUE TO THE FACT
THAT THE COMPANY'S
NOT HOT ITSELF.
THIS IS JUST THE ENVIRONMENT.
SO I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
THAT I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY THOUGHTS, TOO.
I DON'T LIKE
HOW MANY DIFFERENT SKEWS
YOU NEED TO CARRY IN INVENTORY.
YOU GOT MONTHS,
YOU'VE GOT VARIOUS COLORS.
YOU'VE GOT SIZES,
YOU GOT THIS, YOU GOT THAT.
I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY GOT 30
OR 40 DIFFERENT VERSIONS
OF THIS PRODUCT. THAT??THAT'S
WHERE I'M COMING FROM.
OKAY.
IT'S??IT'S TOO CONFUSING OF
A BUSINESS FOR ME, SO I?I'M OUT.
KIM, THERE'S A LOT OF PREGNANT
WOMEN IN NEW YORK CITY,
WHERE I LIVE...
MM?HMM.
RUNNING AROUND
IN PREGNANCY T?SHIRTS.
MM?HMM.
BUT THEY SIMPLY HAVE A MONTH.
IT DOESN'T SAY "DUE IN."
AND IN SOME WAYS, JUST SEEING
A "JANUARY" OR "MARCH,"
FOR ME, FEELS
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEVER...
MM?HMM.
THAN BEING SO LITERATE
AS "DUE IN MARCH."
YEAH, WELL,
THEY TOOK MY IDEA.
(chuckles) THEY DID.
I'M NOT SOLD IN THE VALUE
OF THE "DUE IN" PART OF IT,
SO I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, KIM,
YOU'RE STARTING UPHILL AGAIN.
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO BE THERE
TO, UH, FIGHT THAT BATTLE
WITH YOU. I'M OUT.
GIVE ME ONE REASON
THAT I SHOULD GIVE YOU $50,000.
BECAUSE I'VE DONE
$1.4 MILLION IN SALES
IN MY BASEMENT, ON MY OWN??
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
FOR ME LATELY?
WHO CARES ABOUT THE PAST?
WHAT ABOUT RIGHT NOW? IT??
UH, I?I BELIEVE
THAT THIS BRAND
AND THE ACTUAL PRODUCT IS
A WINNER.
I'M STUCK
ON THIS SUBSEGMENT PROBLEM
BECAUSE I CAN SELL T?SHIRTS
TO 250 MILLION PEOPLE
OR 6 MILLION PEOPLE.
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.
RIGHT.
HMM. 250,000,000.
BUT??
KIM, I GOTTA TELL YOU, THIS IS
THE T?SHIRT DEAL FROM HELL.
YOU CAN'T SELL IT TO ANYBODY
EXCEPT PREGNANT WOMEN,
SALES ARE GOING DOWN,
THE MARKET'S GETTING SOFT,
PRICE POINTS ARE COMING DOWN.
BUT NO, IT'S ALL DEATH
AND DESTRUCTION IN YOUR STORY.
IT'S HORRIBLE. I'M OUT.
(Robert) WOW. THAT WAS...
WOW.
WOW.
WOW.
WOW. THAT'S HARSH.
WELL, AM I WRONG?
TALK ABOUT THROWING THE, UH,
BABY WITH THE BATHWATER.
HE'S NEGATIVE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH?
I DON'T THINK I'M A, YOU KNOW,
A DEATH INVESTMENT.
BUT I?I WOULD BE KILLING MONEY
IF I GAVE IT TO YOU.
I ONLY WORRY ABOUT THE DEATH
OF THE MONEY. THAT'S IT.
OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHAT ARE YOU THANKING US FOR?
BECAUSE SHE'S POLITE.
THAT'S WHY.
BECAUSE I'M A LADY.
(Robert) THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO THANK
ME FOR THAT INFORMATION, DO YOU?
NO, BUT WHAT??
W?WHY ARE YOU, UH...
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST.
THAT'S IT.
(Barbara) BUT SHE'S NOT ARGUING.
LEAVE HER ALONE.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE TRUTH IS
THE BEST MEDICINE.
FINE, KEVIN. ENOUGH.
LET'S GO.
(Robert) SHE'S JUST BEING NICE.
SHE THANKED YOU
FOR LISTENING TO HER.
SHE WAS??YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS.
(Robert) I THINK IT'S VERY
PROFESSIONAL TO THANK SOMEBODY.
THANK YOU.
I HATE THE FACT
WE MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SO BAD.
(O'Leary) YOU KNOW, ROBERT,
WHAT'S DEPRESSING ABOUT YOU IS
YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH THE TRUTH,
BECAUSE THE MONEY
WILL NEVER LIE.
KEVIN??
THAT MONEY IS TELLING ME
THAT THIS IS A LOSER.
KEVIN, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS,
BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S
TRUTHS THAN YOURS IN THE WORLD.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.
THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUTH IN MAKING
MONEY??YOU EITHER MAKE IT
OR YOU LOSE IT. THAT'S IT.
SHE'S LOSING IT.
(Barbara) OKAY, WE'RE DONE.
OKAY, TIME OUT, GUYS.
WE'VE BEEN HERE.
SHE MAY RECOVER.
LET'S GO. TIME OUT.
(sighs) I DEFINITELY BELIEVE
THAT...
COMING AT ME, TELLING ME
THAT MY BUSINESS IS DEAD
AND THAT THIS IS
INVESTMENT SUICIDE
WAS A LITTLE, UH...
IT WAS A LITTLE DISRESPECTFUL
AND A LITTLE UNNECESSARY.
