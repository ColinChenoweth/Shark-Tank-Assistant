MY NAME IS ALDO ORTA.
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM MEXICO CITY.
IN THE PRESENT TIME,
I LIVE IN CHICAGO.
MY WHOLE LIFE,
I'VE BEEN AN ARTIST.
I LEFT HOME BECAUSE
I REALLY WANT TO PURSUE
MY LIFE AS AN ARTIST
AND THE FREEDOM
TO BE AN ARTIST IN AMERICA.
MY ARTWORK IS INSPIRED
FROM ALL CULTURES'
MYTHOLOGY AND HISTORY,
AND IT HAS A MESSAGE??
TO USE THESE SYMBOLS
AS A REMINDER
OF APPRECIATION OF LIFE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ALDO ORTA.
I'M ASKING FOR $180,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 45% OF MY BUSINESS.
I AM THE CREATOR AND DESIGNER
FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL LINE
OF JEWELRY??ALDO ORTA JEWELRY.
I AM HERE HERE BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN VERY EXCLUSIVE.
MOST OF MY CLIENTS
HAS BEEN VERY RICH PEOPLE,
ROYALTY, AND CELEBRITIES.
ROYALTY LIKE
THE ROYAL FAMILY OF KUWAIT,
THE ALGHANIM FAMILY,
THE BACARDI FAMILY.
ALSO I HAVE SO MANY CELEBRITIES,
LIKE CALVIN KLEIN,
CYNDI LAUPER, GRACE JONES,
BRIAN BOITANO, MARTHA WASH,
HOLLY HUNTER??
AND I CAN GO ON AND ON.
I WANT TO DO THE SAME TYPE
OF MAJESTIC, GLAMOROUS,
BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS,
BUT MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE...
WHICH I AM VERY PROUD
TO PRESENT TO YOU.
I MADE THESE TWO DIFFERENT BOXES
FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON??
BECAUSE THIS ONE IS
THE REAL THING??
YOU CAN SEE
ALL MY HIGH?END PIECES??
AND THIS ONE IS
EXACTLY THE SAME QUALITY
WHEN IT COMES TO THE DETAIL,
BUT MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE, WHICH
I WANT FOR THE MASS MARKET.
IS THAT A BELT BUCKLE?
IT'S A BELT BUCKET, YEAH.
IT'S ALEXANDER THE GREAT.
DO I LOOK LIKE ROYALTY? YEAH.
OFF WITH YOUR HEAD.
ALDO, CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE DESIGN?
IS IT RELIGIOUS? IS IT SEXUAL?
(Barbara and Harrington laugh)
WHAT'S THE INSPIRATION?
THE INSPIRATION IS HISTORY
AND MYTHOLOGY
FROM ALL CULTURES.
IT'S NOT A CERTAIN RELIGION...
NO, NO. IT'S TO UNIFY
ALL PEOPLE'S FAITH AND BELIEF,
AND I USE
THE MOST ICONIC SYMBOLS
AS A MESSAGE FOR AWARENESS.
DO YOU DO ALL THIS YOURSELF?
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER DESIGNERS?
I DO EVERYTHING.
THIS IS ALL MY DESIGNS.
WHAT HAPPENS, ALDO,
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
AND A BUS RUNS YOU OVER?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT HAPPENS IF...
THE BUSINESS GOES, CORRECT?
I?I'M??IS??I'M ONE?MAN SHOW.
CORRECT.
ALDO, HOW MUCH IS THIS PIECE?
THAT PIECE IS SILVER WITH ENAMEL
AND GOLD PLATE.
$220.
THIS HAS GOT TO BE PRICED
UNDER $200, I THINK.
CAN YOU DESIGN A LINE
THAT'S UNDER $200?
I HAVE MANY OTHER PIECES HERE
WHERE THEY ARE UNDER $200.
BUT, ALDO, WILL PEOPLE
THAT ARE MAINSTREAM AMERICA
WANT SUCH EXTRAVAGANT JEWELRY
THAT ONLY THE RICH
AND THE ROYAL BUY?
IS THIS MAINSTREAM ENOUGH
THAT MRS. LOBINSKY
IN DES MOINES WANTS IT?
LISTEN, LOOK, ALDO,
WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING
THE ISSUE THAT NOBODY'S
BUYING JEWELRY RIGHT NOW.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANY,
UH, SHOPPING CHANNELS?
ACTUALLY, I WENT
BACK AND FORTH WITH QVC.
THEY LOVED MY JEWELRY.
THEY THINK IT'S A GREAT MARKET.
THEY WANT ME TO COME WITH
$50,000 FOR THE FIRST ORDER.
(Barbara) IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
USING THE MONEY FOR?
YEAH, EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
RIGHT NOW, THE CHALLENGE
I SEE IS YOU'RE??YOU'RE MAKING
VERY EXPENSIVE ONE?OFF PIECES
OF JEWELRY.
YOU'RE NOW GONNA GO
INTO THE MASS MARKET,
BUT YOU'RE NOT EXPERIENCED
IN THAT MASS?MARKET FORMAT.
I'M ON THE FENCE RIGHT NOW.
ALDO, I THINK IT'S UNIQUE.
IT'S INTERESTING.
THE HISTORY PIECE IS WONDERFUL,
BUT I'M STUCK ON THIS PROBLEM.
IF YOU <i>DO</i> GET RUN OVER BY A BUS,
YOU'RE ROAD PIZZA.
I'M AN INVESTOR. I HAVE NOTHING.
I'VE GOT THE HISTORY,
YOUR MEMORIES,
I CAN VISIT YOUR GRAVE,
BUT MY MONEY'S DEAD, TOO.
YOU CAN GET RUN BY THE BUS,
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR FAMILY?
MY FAMILY'S GONNA BE HAPPY,
PARTICULARLY MY KIDS.
(Harrington and Barbara laugh)
AND THEN I HAVE TO BASICALLY
INSURE YOUR LIFE
FOR THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT,
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU ARE IT. YOU'RE THE GUY.
THAT'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM.
YOU'RE LIKE A PICASSO.
AND LOOK AT PICASSO,
WHERE THEY ARE.
YEAH, BUT HE'S BETTER DEAD.
I'M WONDERING,
IF YOU'RE DEAD, IS IT BETTER?
YOU WANT TO KILL ME.
(chuckles) YOU GUYS
ARE WITNESS, OKAY?
IS THE COLLECTION WORTH MORE
IF ALDO'S ROAD PIZZA?
(chuckles)
ALDO, LOVED YOUR PRESENTATION,
BUT WHEN THAT BUS MEETS YOU,
IT'S GONNA BREAK MY HEART.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
ALDO.
YOU KNOW, I?I HAVE
A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS,
AND I?I HAVE TO SAY THIS STUFF
IS BEAUTIFUL,
BUT AT THE MOMENT,
WE'RE GOING THROUGH A STAGE
WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T PAY
THEIR MORTGAGES
AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT
PAYING FOR JEWELRY.
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
THAT I'M OUT.
ALDO, I LOVE YOUR WHOLE LOOK,
I LOVE THE JEWELRY,
BUT FOR A LARGE?SCALE,
MIDDLE AMERICA MARKET,
I STILL THINK THE PRICE POINT'S
TOO HIGH. I'M OUT.
AND I'D LIKE TO SAY, UM,
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS
VERY MUCH??
I THINK YOU LOOK THE PART.
THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY EERIE
ABOUT WATCHING YOU.
MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. AND I
CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU.
MY PASSION.
IT'S BEYOND YOUR PASSION.
YOU JUST LOOK THE PART.
BARBARA, GET A ROOM.
ALL RIGHT.
BARBARA,
DO YOU WANT TO DATE HIM?
(O'Leary and Barbara laugh)
SHE'S GETTING AROUND
TO THE OFFER.
WITH THE CAVEAT
THAT QVC REALLY DOES BUY IN,
I'LL GIVE YOU HALF THE MONEY,
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA GET THE OTHER
HALF FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.
YOUR OFFER FROM QVC??
IS THAT A FIRM OFFER?
YES.
I'LL SAY THIS.
I'M??I'M A VENDOR TO QVC,
SO I?I KNOW THE TERMS
AND CONDITIONS.
YOU KNOW EXACTLY.
AND I HAVE ALL THE INSURANCE
AND EVERYTHING ALREADY IN PLACE,
SO, UM, NOW I'M ON THE FENCE.
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO USE
THE TRACK RECORD
OF THE??OF THE KUWAIT PIECE
AND THE MONACO PIECE?
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT?
ABSOLUTELY.
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.
GET OFF THE FENCE, KEVIN.
I'M IN FOR $90,000.
YEAH! (laughs)
I GET THE BELT BUCKLE, THOUGH.
I'M BUYING THE BELT BUCKLE.
(Barbara) DON'T GIVE HIM
THE BELT BUCKLE.
FORGET ALL THAT.
BEFORE YOU GET HIT BY A BUS,
GIVE ME THAT BELT BUCKLE.
DON'T GIVE IT TO HIM. HE DIDN'T
GIVE YOU ANY CASH. GET IT BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALDO, GET YOUR RING
FROM O'LEARY.
(O'Leary laughs)
YEAH!
THIS IS A ONE?MAN SHOP.
LIKE, IT'S ONE GUY.
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE BUS HITS HIM?
YEAH, BUT THAT'S A NEGATIVE WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT.
NO, IT ISN'T.
IT'S A REALISTIC WAY.
FOR BARBARA AND KEVIN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING
AND APPRECIATION
ON MY BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS
AND THE MEANING BEHIND
AND MY PASSION AS AN ARTIST.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SHARKS.
COMFORTABLE?
THEY'RE HEAVEN.
(chuckles)
CAN I KEEP THEM
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY?
YES. YOU CAN HAVE THEM.
THANK YOU.
(Robert) HOW DO THEY FEEL?
(Barbara) LOVELY.
FEEL GOOD?
OH, MY GOD. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
ONCE PEOPLE TRY IT ON,
THEY BUY IT.
