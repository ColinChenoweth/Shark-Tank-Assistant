HELLO. MY NAME IS
DOMINIQUE McCLAIN BARTEET,
AND MY COMPANY IS ONESOLE.
I'M SEEKING $500,000
FOR 20% EQUITY OF MY COMPANY.
I LOVE SHOES,
AND ONE DAY I WENT TO THE MALL,
AND I BOUGHT A PAIR OF SHOES
AND I BOUGHT IT
IN THREE DIFFERENT COLORS.
I WENT HOME AND I WENT AHA??
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER
TO CHANGE THE TOP ON THE SHOE
BECAUSE THE BOTTOMS ARE
ALL THE SAME?
SO I SET OUT TO CREATE THIS IDEA
AND I DID. IT'S ONESOLE,
AND IT'S THE ORIGINAL
INTERCHANGEABLE SHOE.
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS
BECAUSE IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
YOU CAN QUICKLY AND EASILY
GO FROM ONE LOOK TO ANOTHER
JUST LIKE THAT, IN SECONDS.
WE MADE IT
WHERE ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
YOU CAN EVEN CHANGE
THE STYLE OF THE TOP.
YOU CAN HAVE A CASUAL ONE
LIKE THIS, OR YOU CAN EVEN GO
TO A DRESSY STRAPPY
OR A SLING?BACK OR EVEN A CLOG.
I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY HOW MANY
DIFFERENT LOOKS YOU CAN GET
IN A SINGLE SHOE.
AND ALSO, THIS SHOE HELPED ME
WITH ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAD.
I TRAVELED A LOT,
AND I WOULD HAVE
A WHOLE SUITCASE OF JUST SHOES.
SO NOW I DON'T EVEN PACK SHOES.
I WEAR MY ONESOLES,
PACK A HANDFUL OF TOPS.
I'VE SAVED SPACE
AND LUG??LUGGAGE FEES.
IT'S THE PERFECT TRAVEL SHOE.
ALSO, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF TOPS
TO CHOOSE FROM.
I MEAN, THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE ENDLESS.
AND I'D LIKE
IF BARBARA WOULD TRY THIS,
BECAUSE OUR BEST FEATURE
IS COMFORT.
PERFECT TIMING.
MY FEET ARE KILLING ME.
I'D LOVE TO.
IT'S 'CAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE ONESOLES ON.
UM, WHAT'S THE RETAIL SELLING
PRICE OF??OF THE SHOE?
THE RETAIL FOR THE SHOE
AND A SOLID TOP IS $70 TO $85.
AND THEN TOPS ARE SEPARATE,
OF COURSE,
AND THEY RANGE
FROM $12 TO $30.
DOMINIQUE, INTERESTING STORY.
UM, YOU HAVE A VALUE ON
THIS BUSINESS OF $2.5 MILLION.
(Robert) BUT SHE HAS SALES,
KEVIN.
WHAT ARE THEY?
I THINK MY COMPANY'S WORTH
MORE THAN THAT ACTUALLY.
I HAVE SALES??
OF COURSE IT IS,
BUT WHY DON'T YOU HUMOR ME?
I'M GONNA SURPRISE YOU.
READY?
YEAH.
I HAVE GROSSED OVER $20 MILLION
IN THE LAST 4 YEARS.
I'M IN 2,000 STORES
IN OVER 30 COUNTRIES.
I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL
TV SHOPPING CHANNEL NETWORKS
AND BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.
WHAT ARE SALES LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR WAS LOW.
IT WAS $3.5 MILLION.
I WAS $6 MILLION
THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.
WHERE DO YOU MAKE THIS?
IN CHINA?
NO. WE MAKE THE MOLDS IN ITALY
FOR THE SHOES, AND THEN I MAKE
THE TOPS, ACTUALLY,
IN PALM BEACH, FLORIDA.
CAN'T YOU SAVE MONEY
MAKING IT OFFSHORE?
THAT'S WHY I WANT
TO GET AN INVESTOR
BECAUSE I'M NOT A GOOD SOURCER,
AND I WOULD LIKE??
I HAVE OTHER DESIGNS
FOR MORE COMPLICATED TOPS
THAT I CANNOT POSSIBLY MAKE
IN PALM BEACH,
I MEAN, AND HAVE A GOOD MARGIN.
BUT I'M NOT GOOD AT SOURCING.
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE??
THE HOME SHOPPING BUSINESS
AND, UM, ARE YOU
ON THERE CURRENTLY OR??
UH, I'VE BEEN ON QVC SIX TIMES.
I HAVE DONE NO ADVERTISING
OR MARKETING.
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FINANCING
THIS BUSINESS?
WELL,
I'M REALLY A PHARMACIST.
I GOT??I DID THIS AS A HOBBY
IN THE BACK OF MY PHARMACY.
AND I GOT SO BUSY,
AND IT BLEW UP, LIKE,
PROBABLY THE SECOND YEAR I DID
IT, THAT I MOVED MY PHARMACY
INTO THE SHOE FACTORY.
WOW. YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT
IN SALES THIS YEAR?
UM, I'M OVER $4 MILLION,
SO I'M NOT SURE.
AND I'M??I'M GOING OVERSEAS
A LOT THIS YEAR.
SO I JUST STARTED BRANCHING OUT
INTERNATIONALLY.
AND YOU'RE STILL ACTING
AS A PHARMACIST?
YES, SIR. I FILL PRESCRIPTIONS
AND FILL SHOE ORDERS, TOO.
(laughs)
(Robert) DO YOU MAKE ANY MONEY
ON YOUR SALES?
I MAKE 30% AVERAGE.
PROFITS LAST YEAR
WERE A MILLION DOLLARS?
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS, YEAH.
WHY DO YOU NEED THE MONEY? UM...
WELL, BARBARA
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS.
I, UM, DID A REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENT, LIKE THREE YEARS AGO
IN PALM BEACH, AND IT TIED UP
A LOT OF MY CAPITAL.
DON'T TELL ME
YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE.
I BOUGHT A HOUSE ON THE WATER
THERE AND, UM, NOW NOBODY'S??
OUCH.
YEAH.
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE THEM
AND WHAT DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
AND THEN HOW DO YOU SELL THEM?
THE SOLE...
DIFFERENT STORES
BUY DIFFERENT WAYS.
LIKE, THE DEPARTMENT STORE
DID, LIKE, A TRAVEL KIT.
I HAVE A BAG THAT HAS
THREE SHOES IN ONE,
SO IT'S, LIKE,
A PACKAGE WITH THREE SHOES.
AND HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST
TO MAKE?
THAT COSTS, UM,
$18 FOR??FOR THE 3 TOPS
AND THE PAIR OF SHOES
AND THE BAG.
AND THEN HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL IT TO THE STORE FOR?
$35.
AND HOW MUCH DOES
THE STORE SELL IT FOR?
$85, $95??AROUND THERE.
IT'S ALL PATENTED.
NOBODY CAN COPY THIS?
I HAVE TWO UTILITY PATENTS
AND TWO DESIGN PATENTS
THAT ARE ISSUED AND I HAVE
MORE THAT ARE PENDING.
AND THEN I'M TRADEMARKED
AND COPYRIGHTED IN 98 COUNTRIES.
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST ACCOUNT
OR THE BIGGEST COMPANY
INTERESTED IN YOUR BRAND?
UM, WELL, THIS COMPANY IN JAPAN,
THEY WANT 10,000 PAIR
AND, LIKE, 30,000 TOPS
OF THAT.
THAT'S, LIKE,
A HALF?A?MILLION?DOLLAR ORDER.
(Daymond) WHAT ABOUT
DOMESTICALLY?
JCPenney, SO...
OH, WOW.
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING HERE
BECAUSE THIS IS A REAL BUSINESS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT SOMETIMES.
YEAH, SO IT'S ABOUT
A LACK OF CONFIDENCE
OF DOING IT ON YOUR OWN.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PARTNER.
YEAH. I'M IN ABOVE MY HEAD,
I THINK.
WHY DO YOU SAY YOU'RE IN OVER
YOUR HEAD. YOU SAID THAT??
'CAUSE I'M A PHARMACIST.
I'VE NEVER HAD A BUSINESS CLASS.
I'VE NEVER HAD
A SHOE DESIGN CLASS. I MEAN...
WHY ARE YOU
SELLING YOURSELF SHORT?
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW FEW BUSINESSES WE'VE HAD
COME OUT HERE AND GET
TO YOUR DEGREE OF SALES?
AND THEY'RE ALL OVERCONFIDENT.
(chuckles) I'M ALWAYS??
I'M LIKE A LITTLE TURTLE
THAT GOES AND TAKES BABY STEPS.
AND I JUST WANT TO WIN.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M DOING
EVERYTHING PROPERLY.
THAT'S WHY I DON'T??
I DON'T TAKE THAT BIG JUMP,
BUT NOW I'M READY TO GO
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
AND JUST RAMP IT UP.
DOMINIQUE, IF I WERE TO PUT
THE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS UP,
WHAT WOULD YOU USE IT FOR?
WELL, WOULD BE MAKE SURE
I COULD FILL THESE BIG ORDERS
THAT ARE FIXING TO COME IN.
THEY'RE GOING CRAZY
IN SWITZERLAND
OVER MY SHOES RIGHT NOW.
I MEAN, I HAVE PEOPLE FIGHTING
OVER ME IN SAUDI ARABIA.
I HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
DISTRIBUTORS IN AUSTRALIA
AND NEW ZEALAND GOING CRAZY.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THIS YEAR
IT WENT INTERNATIONAL, AND IT'S
JUST REALLY OVERWHELMING.
WHAT A FASCINATING STORY. WOULD
YOU SELL THE WHOLE BUSINESS?
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D WANT
TO DO THAT. (chuckles)
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 10%,
BUT...
GET THE OTHER FOUR GUYS IN.
AND WE'RE IN 50/50,
AND YOU GET THE $500,000.
DOMINIQUE, GREAT JOB.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'M GONNA WEAR THOSE HOME.
I DO HAVE YOUR SIZE, TOO.
VERY GENEROUS OFFER, DAYMOND.
MY DEAL WAS STILL THE BEST.
I MADE THE OFFER
BECAUSE I LIKE TO WIN,
AND THAT IS A WIN.
THAT IS A WIN.
I JUST GOT HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS FROM DAYMOND.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
AND FOR THE??
A LESS PERCENTAGE
THAN I COULD IMAGINE.
I MEAN, 35%??I REALLY THOUGHT
HE WOULD'VE TAKEN ME TO 50%
OR??OR TRIED FOR MORE.
I MEAN, I AM JUST ECSTATIC
RIGHT NOW.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT STILL.
