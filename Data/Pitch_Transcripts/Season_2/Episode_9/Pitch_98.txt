I'M REBECCA RESCATE. I LIVE
IN YARDLEY, PENNSYLVANIA,
WITH MY FAMILY
AND MY LOVING CAT SAMANTHA.
A FEW YEARS AGO,
WE WERE LIVING
IN A TINY APARTMENT
IN MANHATTAN.
THE PROBLEM WAS, AS SOON AS YOU
WALKED IN OUR FRONT DOOR,
YOU KNEW WE HAD A CAT.
YOU COULD SMELL THE LITTER BOX
NO MATTER HOW OFTEN
WE CLEANED IT.
IT STUNK UP THE PLACE.
IT'S GROSS.
EW!
IT HAD TO GO. WHEN I WAS
LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION,
I WAS LOOKING
TO JUST BUY SOMETHING
THAT COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
FOR ME, AND IT DIDN'T EXIST.
SO I CREATED MY OWN,
AND CitiKitty WAS BORN.
NOW OUR HOME IS LITTER?FREE
AND MESS?FREE AND PERFECT.
SINCE I STARTED CitiKitty,
A LOT HAS CHANGED.
I'VE MOVED OUT TO THE SUBURBS,
I HAVE THREE KIDS...
(girl speaks indistinctly)
AND I'M LIMITED ON TIME.
I HAVE GREAT VISIONS
FOR CitiKitty.
AND I NEED HELP.
I NEED SOMEBODY THAT'S AN EXPERT
AT BRINGING A PRODUCT TO MARKET
AND GETTING IT INTO MASS RETAIL.
I WANT CAT OWNERS AROUND
THE WORLD TO BE USING IT,
AND I NEED THE SHARKS' HELP
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
HI. I'M REBECCA RESCATE,
FOUNDER OF CitiKitty.
CitiKitty IS SEEKING $100,000
FOR 15% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
FOR THE 200 MILLION CAT OWNERS
AROUND THE WORLD,
CLEANING A LITTER BOX IS
A CHORE THAT WE ALL DREAD.
LITTER BOXES...
ARE GERM BREEDING GROUNDS.
KITTY LITTER GETS TRACKED
EVERYWHERE,
THEY STINK UP OUR HOMES,
THEY COST LOTS OF MONEY
TO CONTINUALLY FILL,
AND THEY CAUSE FIGHTS
IN OTHERWISE
PEACEFUL HOUSEHOLDS,
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS
TO CLEAN THIS THING.
IT'S DISGUSTING. AND CAT OWNERS
DON'T KNOW THERE'S ANY OPTION.
BUT THERE IS.
YOU CAN TOILET?TRAIN YOUR CAT
WITH CitiKitty.
(O'Leary and Robert laugh)
TAKE A LOOK HERE.
(sharks laughing)
WITH CitiKitty,
THE DIRTY LITTER BOX IS GONE,
YOUR HOME IS CLEANER,
YOU'RE SAVING MONEY,
YOU'RE DOING GOOD
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT,
AND LIFE AT HOME IS BETTER
FOR YOU AND YOUR CAT.
CAN YOU GET IT AT ANY AGE?
IF IT'S AN OLD CAT,
DOESN'T WANT TO LEARN
NEW TRICKS?
OLD CATS CAN LEARN NEW TRICKS.
MY CAT WAS 11
WHEN I TOILET?TRAINED HER.
I DID SOME RESEARCH??
HOW DO YOU TOILET?TRAIN A CAT?
IN A MATTER OF WEEKS,
SAMANTHA WAS USING THE TOILET,
THE LITTER BOX WAS GONE,
WE WERE SAVING MONEY. IT WORKS.
OKAY, WALK ME THROUGH
HOW YOU TRAINED SAMANTHA.
YOU SAID, "SAMANTHA, YOU CAN'T
POOP IN THE LITTER ANYMORE."
OKAY, SO THE REASON
A CAT USES A LITTER BOX
IS BECAUSE IT IS THE OPTION
WE GIVE THEM TO COVER THE S??
THE SMELL OR THE SCENT
OF THEIR WASTE FROM PREDATORS.
TO AVOID BEING TORN TO SHREDS
BY A LARGER ANIMAL.
EXACTLY. SO WHEN
YOU TOILET?TRAIN THEM,
WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE
YOUR CAT IS ACTUALLY PERCHING
AND THEY'RE GOING THE BATHROOM
IN THE WATER OF THE TOI??
THAT'S WHEN THEY REALIZE
THAT THE WATER OF THE TOILET
COVERS THE SCENT BETTER
THAN KITTY LITTER, AND IT'S JUST
A GRADUAL TRANSITION
FROM LITTER BOX TO TOILET.
YOU TAKE THE CitiKitty TRAINING
SEAT THAT YOU SEE THERE,
YOU PUT IN ON YOUR TOILET,
AND YOU FILL IT WITH
A SMALL AMOUNT OF KITTY LITTER.
YOU NEED A SPECIAL SEAT?
THAT'S WHAT CitiKitty IS.
SO THIS IS YOUR REGULAR TOILET.
YOU LIFT IT UP, TAKE IT OFF.
(Barbara) OH.
AFTER ONE WEEK,
YOU REMOVE THE FIRST RING
FROM THE TRAINING SEAT,
THAT'S IN ITS CENTER.
IT WILL MAKE A SMALL HOLE
IN THE TRAINING SEAT.
IT'S ABOUT THAT BIG.
YOUR CAT WILL CONTINUE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM IN
THE LITTER OF THE TRAINING SEAT.
THE SAME THING AT RING TWO??
YOU'RE MAKING THE HOLE LARGER.
AND AT THE THIRD RING,
THAT'S WHEN THEY'LL START
AIMING IN THE WATER
OF THE TOILET,
AND THAT'S WHEN THE CAT REALIZES
THE WATER OF THE TOILET
COVERS THE SCENT OF THE WASTE
BETTER THAN KITTY LITTER.
I'LL BET IT'LL BE GREAT
TO BE THERE FOR THAT.
THE CAT ACTUALLY LOOKS DOWN IN
THE BOWL AND SAYS, "OH, WATER."
YEAH.
"OH, I'M GOOD."
"I'M GOOD. I'M NOT GONNA BE
TORN TO SHREDS BY A PREDATOR."
YEAH. YEAH.
WHAT IF I HAVE TO GO
TO THE TOILET AFTER THE KITTY?
JUST LIFT THE TOILET SEAT UP,
TAKE IT OFF, AND SET IT ASIDE,
AND THEN YOU PUT IT BACK ON??
DURING THE TRAINING.
THAT'S ONLY FOR A FEW WEEKS.
DURING THE TRAINING,
DO THEY MISS THE SEAT AT TIMES?
I'M NOT SURE I'D SHARE MY TOILET
WITH MY CAT.
YOU'RE SO SELFISH, BARBARA.
YEAH.
NO, NO. I JUST WONDER
IF THEY ARE ACCURATE.
THEY ARE VERY ACCURATE. PEOPLE
SAY, "OH, I DON'T WANT TO SHARE
MY TOILET SEAT WITH??WITH
MY CAT." THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.
NO, WHAT'S DISGUSTING IS HAVING
YOUR CAT USE A LITTER BOX.
LET'S NOT FORGET
THIS IS A BOX OF POOP,
AND YOUR CAT IS GOING
TO THE BATHROOM IN THERE,
AND THEN THEY'RE WALKING
IN YOUR HOUSE,
THEY'RE WALKING ON YOUR SOFA,
YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER.
THIS IS SO CRAZY.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER??
OKAY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE CATS,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
(O'Leary and Barbara laugh)
NOW IS THERE ANY LIABILITY
IF SOMEBODY'S CAT DROWNS?
LIABILITY, DAYMOND?
IF SOMEBODY'S CAT DROWNS.
THEY'RE HOPPING UP
ON THE TOILET...
OH.
AND FALLS IN AND IS DEAD,
THEIR BELOVED??
JUST GET A NEW CAT.
THEY'RE 15 BUCKS.
(Daymond) YEAH. (laughs)
THAT'S HORRIBLE.
I HAVE TO SAY THAT.
DOES THE CAT EVER FALL IN?
NO, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
REBECCA,
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR
AND WHAT'S IT COST
TO MAKE THIS PRODUCT?
THE RETAIL IS $29.99.
EACH COST PER UNIT IS $4.76.
I MANUFACTURE IN QUANTITIES
OF 10,000.
HOW MANY OF THESE
HAVE YOU SOLD ACTUALLY?
I HAVE SOLD 40,000 OF THESE
OFF MY WEB SITE ALONE.
THIS YEAR I'M DOING
$350,000 IN SALES.
LAST YEAR I DID $225,000.
I HAVE SOLD $1.4 MILLION
IN CAT TOILET?TRAINING KITS,
AND I HAVE NEVER ADVERTISED.
I'VE BEEN ON
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA," CNN,
I'VE BEEN
IN "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL."
PEOPLE LOVE TALKING ABOUT IT.
IT'S GOT BROAD APPEAL.
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU PUT UP SO FAR?
INITIALLY,
I INVESTED $20,000,
BUT CitiKitty IS
A CONSTANT INVESTMENT,
SO I'M CONSTANTLY PUTTING MONEY
BACK IN THE COMPANY
WHILE REMAINING PROFITABLE.
SO WHAT WILL YOU USE
THE MONEY FOR?
I WOULD USE THE MONEY TO HI??UM,
TO GET SALES REPS FOR CitiKitty,
AND ALSO DO MARKETING.
I WANT TO TAKE CitiKitty
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
I BELIEVE THIS IS
A MULTIMILLION?DOLLAR PRODUCT.
WELL, REBECCA,
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I'M AT.
IT'S JUST NOT A BUSINESS
I HAVE, UH, ANY INTEREST IN
OR CAN ADD VALUE.
AND I DON'T HAVE A CAT.
I HAVE A DOG. UH, SO I'M OUT.
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.
REBECCA, I HATE CATS.
I HATE THEM.
BUT YOU LOVE MONEY, RIGHT?
I LOVE MONEY.
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
BUT IF A CAT EVER
GAVE ME A PROBLEM,
AND I WAS IN A HIGH APARTMENT,
I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT CAT
FIVE MINUTES LATER. I'M OUT.
WHEW. TOUGH CROWD.
REBECCA,
I LOOK FOR TWO THINGS??
I LOOK FOR A?A PRODUCT
THAT SOLVES A PROBLEM
AND A MASS?MARKET PRODUCT,
AND I THINK THIS MEETS
BOTH OF THOSE.
EVERY PET STORE IN AMERICA
WILL WANT THIS PRODUCT
IF YOU PUT THIS ON TV.
THAT'S WHAT I DO,
AND I'M INTERESTED
IN THIS DEAL.
SO I WOULD GIVE YOU
THE $100,000,
BUT I WOULD NEED
40% OF THE COMPANY.
UM, I'D LIKE TO HEAR
ALL THE OTHER OFFERS
BEFORE... COUNTERING.
WHO SAID
THERE'S ANY OTHER OFFERS?
UM, I WAS ON THE FENCE.
I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY
A BETTER OFFER
WITH A BETTER STRATEGIC PARTNER,
SO I'M GONNA BE OUT.
OKAY.
REBECCA, I HAVE AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE.
LET'S GET
TO THE BOTTOM LINE HERE.
NO, WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
OBVIOUSLY KEVIN'S A GREAT GUY
TO PUT IT ON TV.
THE DOWNSIDE TO HIS OFFER IS,
IS IT COSTS
A LOT OF MONEY
TO MAKE A TV COMMERCIAL.
IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
TO BUY THE AIRTIME.
I DON'T THINK $100,000 IS
GONNA DO IT.
SO YOU REALLY NEED A PARTNER
IN THE TV BUSINESS,
AND MY PARTNER IN NEW YORK OWNS
THE BIGGEST TV BUSINESS
CALLED "AS SEEN ON TV,"
SO I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000
FOR ONLY THE 15% IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO TAKE THE CHANCE
THAT HE BUYS IN
ON PUTTING IT ON TV.
DID YOU CATCH
THAT SUBTLE NUANCE?
SHE'S SAYING
ONLY IF HER FRIEND LIKES IT
VERSUS HARRINGTON, WHO'S SAYING
HE WANTS TO DO A DEAL.
IT'S A RISK DEAL.
REBECCA, I AM THE TV EXPERT
IN THE PANEL HERE. OKAY?
YES.
SHE HAS TO GO TO SOMEBODY THAT
MAY LIKE IT, MAY NOT LIKE IT.
YOU'RE HERE TO DO A DEAL.
BUT LET??WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
BUT LET ME ALSO SAY TO YOU,
I SUSPECT VERY MUCH
HE'LL LIKE IT,
BECAUSE THE ONLY CRITERIA HE HAS
IS PROVEN SALES.
WHAT A FASCINATING SITUATION??
WITH CERTAINTY, YOU HAVE
TO GIVE UP 40% EQUITY
OR WITH THE RISK YOU'VE GOT,
YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY 15% EQUITY.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
REBECCA,
I'M READY TO DO THIS DEAL.
I'M READY TO PRODUCE THE TV
COMMERCIAL, BUY THE MEDIA,
AND GET THIS INTO
EVERY PET STORE IN AMERICA.
I THINK YOU'RE HEARING
FROM BARBARA, SHE HAS TO GO
TO SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA MAYBE
SAY YES AND MAYBE SAY NO.
YOU'RE HERE TO DO A DEAL TODAY.
I'M READY TO DO A DEAL.
I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT PARTNER
FOR THIS,
BUT AT 40% FOR $100,000,
I CAN'T DO IT.
IT'S NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST
FOR CitiKitty.
I MADE $100,000 LAST YEAR ALONE,
AND THAT PRODUCT WASN'T
EVEN IN RETAIL YET.
GIVE ME A COUNTEROFFER.
20% AT $100,000.
YOU ARE ONE SHREWD CAT.
$100,000, 25%.
THAT'S IT.
UM...
LET ME JUST REMIND YOU THAT
EVERY TIME I JUMPED INTO BED
WITH A GUY IN A BUSINESS DEAL,
IT WAS SWEET IN THE BEGINNING.
IT NEVER WOUND UP
IN A GOOD PLACE.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
BRING IT BACK TO SEX?
YOU USE SEX.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D SAY THAT.
(Barbara) THIS ISN'T ABOUT SEX.
UM...
YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT
AND COME BACK?
NO, NO, NO.
(Harrington) DON'T MAKE
THE WRONG MOVE.
NO, NO. NO, IF I WALK OUT HERE,
THERE'S DAGGERS IN MY BACK.
(Daymond) SHE MUST KNOW US.
IT'S TIME TO MAKE A DECISION.
IT'S JUST NOT... OH.
KEVIN, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
THE GURU FOR AS SEEN ON TV,
BUT I LIKE BARBARA.
I LIKE THE FEMALE TOUCH.
(groans)
(speaks indistinctly) I'M
A FEMALE. LOOK AT ME. BIG SELL.
SHE'S TRYING TO PLAY IT UP.
SHE'S SO SEXIST.
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
SOMETHING ABOUT BARBARA
THAT YOU CAN'T TURN AWAY FROM,
AND IT'S??IT'S A HEART. I MEAN??
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED?
IT'S CALLED TRUST.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
OH, COME ON!
(Daymond and O'Leary groan)
LOOK, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T SPEND
THE REST OF OUR LIVES HERE.
YOUR CAT'S GONNA BE DEAD
BY THE TIME YOU GET HOME.
I WOULD DO??
I WOULD DO 20% AT $100,000.
I LOVE YOU, BARBARA,
BUT I WOULD DO THAT.
OH.
ALWAYS ABOUT MONEY.
DON'T DO IT, BECAUSE I'M GONNA
DROP THE CONTINGENCY,
JUST TO KNOCK HIM
OUT OF THE BOX.
(gasps) WHY?
YOU ARE A WITCH, BARBARA.
I'M NOT A WITCH.
CAN'T WE WORK TOGETHER?
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE
WORKED TOGETHER BEFORE.
CAN WE WORK TOGETHER? I?I?I...
I THINK WE STAND ALONE
ON THIS DEAL.
OHH!
(Daymond) OHH!
IF YOU DON'T MAKE A DECISION,
I'M TAKING A CONTRACT OUT
ON YOUR CAT. YOU GET HOME,
HE'LL BE MISSING.
YOU'VE GOT THE SOLID TV GUY
AND THE WITCH SNAKE.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DECISION
TO BE MADE RIGHT HERE.
SO NOW I'M SAYING I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR THE 15%
WITH NO CONTINGENCIES,
SO THE RISK OF ME PRODUCING IT
ON TV's ON MY SIDE.
DON'T YOU THINK I'M GONNA BE
MOTIVATED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?
I'VE MADE AN OFFER, REBECCA.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
RIGHT NOW.
20%, $100,000.
YES.
OKAY.
CRAP!
(Daymond) AAH! (laughs)
(Robert) YEAH! VERY GOOD!
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
KEVIN. WHOO!
ONE FOR THE BOYS.
ONE FOR THE BOYS.
YEAH!
(O'Leary) REBECCA, WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE LOVE?
I <i>DO</i> LOVE YOU, BARBARA!
BYE. AAH!
KEVIN, YOU'RE A DIRTY DOG.
(Robert)
DO YOU REALLY HAVE A CAT?
I LOVE CATS. I DON'T HAVE ONE.
I LOVE THEM, THOUGH. (laughs)
THEY MAKE MONEY, OKAY?
(Robert laughs)
WITHOUT "SHARK TANK,"
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.
I'D BE SELLING THEM
ONE AT A TIME, YOU KNOW,
ACROSS THE INTERNET. AND THIS IS
GONNA MAKE THE PRODUCT HUGE.
I FEEL IT IN MY BONES,
I FEEL IT IN MY SOUL
THAT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP
FOR THIS COMPANY.
