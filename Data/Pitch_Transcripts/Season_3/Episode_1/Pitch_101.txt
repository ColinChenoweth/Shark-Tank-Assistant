Hello, sharks.
My name is Dave Mayer,
How many units is that, Dave?
It's about 150,000 units.
(laughs)
We're in every single
retailer that matters.
It's so simple.
It's one of those ideas
that--when you showed it to me,
my first thought was--
of course.
Why didn't all the bottles
start this way?
Your, uh, mascot looks like
he's about 7-foot-18.
(mark laughs)
You guys should meet him.
I am the clean bottle boy!
Ride Clean or die!
Are you kidding me?
Oh! My God!
(mark laughs)
Champions ride Clean.
Losers--they ride dirty.
Who is that?
Bill Walton's, like, one of
the all-time greatest centers
in NBA history.
How would you get
a superstar like this?
I saw him at a--
at a basketball game,
Dave, tell us
the economics, okay?
You've sold $750,000.
150,000 units.
That's 5 bucks a pop, right?
That's right.
Did you make any money
on the $750,000?
In the last 12 months,
we made $118,000.
Why aren't you just
investing that
so you don't need
$60,000,
you keep your 5% equity?
$118,000--we're using
a lot of that money.
We're about to take out
the tools
for the stainless steel
Bottle.
That's $68,000.
I need to eat. I have a--
I have a family, two kids,
So, Dave, here's what
I think about you--
I think you're smart,
you're slick,
So, Dave, I'm not offended
by the low percentage ask,
'cause you're not asking
for a lot of money.
I think you were dead on
when you valuated Kevin's offer.
He's taking cash flow
out of a business,
which is like sucking blood
out of a business
when it's starting out.
I think that's what you do
when you take equity.
You know you can't do that.
You're stealing his company.
Kevin. Daymond is valuing
your entire company
at $240,000--
I'm valuing my time.
Now, I can--I can
change the offer
Dave, you know,
I think you have two
very good offers on the table,
so I'm gonna retract
my offer. I'm out.
Dave, time for you
to make a decision.
What do you want to do?
Well, Dave, hang on a sec.
I'm not real good with
people completely ignoring me.
to walk away
from the deal, Dave.
Are you planning on meeting him
in the middle or holding steady?
No, I'm gonna hold Steady.
Then you should be thanking us
for all dropping out.
I am.
So, Dave,
you talk to your dad?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
Dave, think about it.
All right. Let's do it. Let's do
it, man. What do you say?
(Barbara) Oh, thank God.
