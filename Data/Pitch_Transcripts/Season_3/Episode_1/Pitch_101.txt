I'm alashe Nelson.
I'm from miami, Florida,
and the name of my company
is ez vip.
We've all had that night
where you go out,
you go to a club,
you're stuck outside,
you can't get in,
and it can be
really embarrassing.
I had enough
of all the uncertainty
that come with going out,
and that's exactly when
I created ez Vip.
Everything good?
Everything good?
It's good.
I've been able to hire staff,
get in new office space,
and we're turning a profit.
Right now, we're only in miami,
but I've proven
my business works.
My company's on the verge
of something big,
and more important
than the money,
I wanna align myself
with the sharks
for all they can bring
to the Table.
Hi. My name
is alashe Nelson.
I'm from miami, Florida,
and I'm founder and C.E.O.
Of ez vip.
I'm seeking $150,000
for a 15% stake in my company.
Say you're visiting
miami tonight.
You heard about
this great event going on.
It's the talk of the town.
So you decide
to take a couple friends
and a couple clients out
to entertain them
and show them a good time.
Only problem is,
when you arrive at this event,
there's over
700 people outside,
and now your whole night
is in jeopardy
and you're embarrassed in front
of your friends and clients
because you just brought them
to an event
that you can't even
get them into.
This scenario happens to people
every night of the week.
I thought to myself,
there has to be a better way.
I envisioned a Web site
where people could come,
view the best events
in any city,
and prepurchase
their night out.
What expedia does
for airlines
or what opentable
does for restaurants--
we do that for night life.
Once you find the exact
events you want to attend,
you can prepurchase
admission tickets,
uh, bottle service.
I mean, you can even choose
the exact V.I.P. Table
inside of a venue
that you want to attend.
Once you select everything,
you make your purchase.
That's it, you're done.
And it doesn't matter if you
do it a day in advance
or three months in advance.
You can always opt to have
one of our ez vip reps
meet you in the front,
walk you in,
and give you the treatment
you deserve.
We launched in miami,
which we all know
is one of the biggest
nightlife markets in the world,
and right away,
it was a hit.
So I just have one question
for everyone--
who wants to be V.I.P.
With me?
How much money
you making on this?
Just in miami,
we did $90,000 net.
Really?
Gross, we did
a little over $250,000.
Impressive.
Just in miami alone.
What are the levels of
these type of venues?
Are they high-end?
Luxury?
All high-end. All high-end.
With us, it's about having
the top venues in any place.
So when you come to ez vip,
you can close your eyes
and point to a venue,
and you'll wanna be there
for one reason or another.
If you didn't wanna be there,
they wouldn't be on our site.
Last time I went to miami,
it cost me $130,000
in Champagne.
I could have called you,
and you would have
saved me some money?
I'm so glad
you brought that up.
(laughs)
Some people came to our site.
They were from out of town--
well, actually,
out of the country.
I think, like, russia
or something like that.
They prepurchased their night
to an event, right?
Two months in advance.
I think they spent, like,
$1,000 on a table.
Fast forward
Two months later.
A-a big game happened.
These guys won and they went out
to celebrate that night, okay?
I happen to have been
there that night
that my Buddy, uh...
(laughs)
Won the nba championship.
I was there. I was there.
I was there.
Once he went in there,
the table minimums went to
$20,000, $30,000, $40,000.
Are you saying that night,
somebody actually
prebooked with you,
that person was locked in,
and the Promoter didn't say,
"you can't come in now.
I'm getting $10,000"?
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm saying.
And once a sale goes through,
that sale is final.
And all of the prices
That's set on the site
are set beforehand.
I somewhat don't believe it,
because they may say, "I'm not
giving this to your people.
"I can get $5,000 easily here
and you're gonna try to book out
10 of my--or 20 of my tables"?
how it works is this--
say if the venue has
30 tables,
and they're willing
to presell Ten or five.
You come to the site, you're
gonna get a list of events--
only the top events--
and from there you select
the exact table you want,
a picture of that table
comes up,
you see this table has
a $700 minimum. It seats 6.
And the advantage to the owner
is that you're selling it
ahead of time,
so they know they got
cash coming in.
Is it only in miami?
Right now,
we launched in Miami.
Now we just secured contracts
in L.A., vegas, and new York.
How do you even know I'm the guy
with the table waiting?
The bouncer
has Everyone's name
who prepurchased something
that night.
Listen, daymond is out
every night
with At least five Girls
on his arms.
No, I-I got two Puppies.
He lives that life, I'm at home
reading a novel every Night.
Yeah.
So this is a life that
I can't even relate to.
Yeah.
And for that reason alone,
I'm out.
Our whole thing
is access and Convenience.
That's what we push
to our clients.
The reason why I started
with Nightclubs and nightlife
in General is because That's
the market I understand.
Let me tell you, um,
where I'm at on this deal.
It's a very interesting, um,
business you've built.
I admire your initiative here.
But I'm sitting at home
with Barbara
with the dog by the fireplace.
Oh, I'm gonna get sick.
I'm out.
I like the idea, right?
Al, I like you.
You know, I see the game.
I see what you're trying to do.
Yeah.
But it's just hard
for me to connect
with this type of business.
And that's why
you have a partner.
You wouldn't have
to worry about that.
Well, but I do, right?
Because things I do...
Yeah.
I like to be
successful at.
Yeah.
And I like to kick ass at.
And I just don't know if I'll
be able to connect enough
and provide enough time
to really get you
to the next level.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
I love the idea,
but I hate to admit it,
but I'm a pretty old,
Boring guy.
I don't really
hang out at nightclubs.
I'd love to be in on this
if you can get daymond involved.
I'll give you the $75,000
if you can get
the other $75,000 from daymond.
For what percentage?
Well, I'm not there yet,
Kevin.
Now... I've always wanted
to go clubbing with a croatian.
Always.
(laughter)
Uh...
daymond, you don't go out
'till midnight.
I'm asleep by 11:00.
And here is my opportunity.
Whoo-whoo!
right?
(laughs)
I want 45%.
(Kevin) Whoa.
Robert understands
technology,
so I would partner up
with Robert.
So, Robert, if you're okay
with $150,000 for 45%...
I'm in.
$75,000 from daymond,
$75,000 from me,
and I promise I will never
be seen in the nightclubs.
We want you there.
For 45%.
Um, so that's an offer?
I... I have to
turn that offer down.
Wow.
Wow, you didn't even
think about it.
(daymond) Yeah.
(Barbara) Wow.
This isn't
a $1-million company.
This isn't a $10 million,
$50 million,
this is a $100,
$500 million company.
So for me to sell 45--
not today. Not today.
For me to sell--but I
understand where it's going.
If you would have offered me
that 12 months ago...
make a counter.
Maybe we would have had
a conversation.
Make a counter.
(Barbara) Impressive.
18.
18 what?
18%.
Crazy.
(laughs)
18%.
I love your confidence.
See, that's almost
an insult.
It's no emotions.
It's just...
sometimes in negotiations,
when we're so far apart...
mm-hmm.
It doesn't make any sense.
I don't wanna waste
your time.
No. It's no waste of time.
We're talking about money.
It's never a waste of time.
We're just talking.
I love that.
So all right. All right.
All right. Check this out.
I'll--I'll sweeten
it a little bit.
Okay.
I work with
a lot of artists.
I work with Pitbull.
He's one of the biggest
artists in the world.
Ooh!
I'm going back to the 45,
but I'll throw in
an artist like pitbull.
That's a big deal.
A face
behind the brand.
For 45%.
That's what this is missing.
Here's what I'll do.
I'll go halves with you,
but no Robert.
I hate being screwed
on these deals.
It's nothing personal, Robert.
No, it <i>is </i>personal, cuban.
Okay, it is.
It is, but I don't care.
(laughs)
I know you don't care because
you're that kind of guy.
I mean, you sit there and you
screw us all in the very end.
I get it.
