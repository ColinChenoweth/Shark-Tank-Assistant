Hello, sharks.
My name is Dave Mayer,
and my company is
clean bottle.
I'm here today
seeking $60,000
in exchange for 5%
of the company.
Like pretty much everyone
these days,
I use a water bottle.
And they're great.
You don't have to spend
a fortune on bottled water,
and it's just the right thing
to do for the environment.
But these bottles all have
one major problem--
you can't get to the bottom
of them to clean them out.
So every two weeks
that go by,
I'd open my bottle,
and it looked like
a science experiment
gone wrong.
It's full of mold,
it smelled disgusting.
The last thing I wanna do
is drink out of this thing.
So one day, it hit me.
And that's when I came up
with the clean bottle.
It's the world's Only bottle
that unscrews from the bottom
as well as the top.
So you can get in there,
clean it out,
air-dry it so it doesn't
get nasty in the first place,
and the nozzle comes out,
so you can clean that out,
as well.
So I launched the product
about a year ago.
And I didn't have a lot
of money to market it,
so I had to get creative.
I went to the biggest
bike race in the world.
Check out what I did.
Oh.
That's fantastic!
(laughter)
That is great.
Talk about
guerilla marketing.
Let me show you
the running Holder.
I know you ran
the New York marathon.
A lot of people
run with water, as you know.
(Robert) This is
a very clever Idea.
Thank you.
You got any sales?
I launched the product
in may,
right before
the Tour de France.
Right.
Since then, I've sold
$750,000 worth of bottles.
How many units is that, Dave?
It's about 150,000 units.
(laughs)
We're in every single
retailer that matters.
It's so simple.
It's one of those ideas
that--when you showed it to me,
my first thought was--
of course.
Why didn't all the bottles
start this way?
Your, uh, mascot looks like
he's about 7-foot-18.
(mark laughs)
You guys should meet him.
I am the clean bottle boy!
Ride Clean or die!
Are you kidding me?
Oh! My God!
(mark laughs)
Champions ride Clean.
Losers--they ride dirty.
Who is that?
Bill Walton's, like, one of
the all-time greatest centers
in NBA history.
How would you get
a superstar like this?
I saw him at a--
at a basketball game,
and I knew that he
was a cyclist.
And you just went up to him?
I went up to him.
You know, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.
Bill, are you part
of this deal in some way,
other than appearing here today?
No. I'm just a fan,
and I'm a user
and I'm a believer.
Dave, tell us
the economics, okay?
You've sold $750,000.
150,000 units.
That's 5 bucks a pop, right?
That's right.
Did you make any money
on the $750,000?
In the last 12 months,
we made $118,000.
Why aren't you just
investing that
so you don't need
$60,000,
you keep your 5% equity?
$118,000--we're using
a lot of that money.
We're about to take out
the tools
for the stainless steel
Bottle.
That's $68,000.
I need to eat. I have a--
I have a family, two kids,
and I want
strategic investors.
Dave, you under--you
understand my skepticism?
Great--great Presentation.
Love the tall guy...
I am the clean bottle boy!
Throw it down, big man!
Throw it down!
But it's $60,000!
You're asking for $60,000.
(daymond) For 5%!
You're here to make
one of us work for you,
because you're
only offering us 5%.
You know, I'm--I'm greedy
just like you guys.
I don't wanna give away
two arms--cut off two arms
when you only have
to cut off one Pinkie.
$60,000 is 5%.
I'm willing to negotiate.
If you guys wanna
go up more,
if you believe in the product,
you believe in the vision,
then we can have
that conversation.
So, Dave, here's what
I think about you--
I think you're smart,
you're slick,
you're greedy,
and it's offensive...
and I can't wait to be
your friend and partner.
All right. Thanks.
Right?
But it has to be worth it
for me.
Now you're offering,
for $60,000, 5%.
But I would want 25%.
Okay.
So I've worked at Goldman Sachs
for two years.
All I did was valuation.
That's just
the wrong outcome for me.
I mean, $60,000 for 25%?
Is that what you said?
You know what? You know why?
So $240,000 is how
you're valuing the company?
I'm not valuing the Company.
Okay.
I'm valuing my time.
5% is not enough
for me to get out of bed.
How much would it take?
25%.
Okay.
Are there any other offers?
I'll give you $100,000
for zero equity
and 50 cents of every bottle
you sell in perpetuity.
I respect your offer,
but I think
to siphon off cash
at a time when
we're growing the quickest,
I don't think you would advise
anyone to do that deal.
What you need is capital
to buy inventory.
I'm here not just
for the money.
God's honest truth--
I'm here for you guys.
It's advice. It's getting
on the phone once a month.
Let's have some coffee.
Let's talk.
You know what is such
a turn-off for me in this deal?
5%. It feels offensive to me.
Would you have taken
5% for facebook?
So don't discount that.
Well put.
So, Dave, I'm not offended
by the low percentage ask,
'cause you're not asking
for a lot of money.
I think you were dead on
when you valuated Kevin's offer.
He's taking cash flow
out of a business,
which is like sucking blood
out of a business
when it's starting out.
I think that's what you do
when you take equity.
You know you can't do that.
You're stealing his company.
Kevin. Daymond is valuing
your entire company
at $240,000--
I'm valuing my time.
Now, I can--I can
change the offer
if you and I
don't have to speak
and it's just
an investment.
That's so disrespectful.
I mean, the guy's a nice guy.
Why wouldn't you help
the guy out if you can?
It's not about helping.
It's about time.
Here's my offer--
$60,000 for 10%.
Okay.
Mark?
I'll give you $60,000
for 8%,
because I see the vision
and I see where you can go,
and I think it's gonna
be worth a lot of money.
Final offers, everyone?
All the offers are in?
I'll give you $60,000
for 5%.
Your original ask.
I mean, I don't own
a basketball team,
but I have a lot of connections
in the sports world.
I spent last weekend biking
with Lance Armstrong
and Steven Bauer.
I'm happy to take 5%.
It's a bit of a flier.
I'll give you the $60,000--
exactly what you asked for.
Dave, you know,
I think you have two
very good offers on the table,
so I'm gonna retract
my offer. I'm out.
And just to clear the deck,
this just isn't
my type of business.
I'm out.
Dave, time for you
to make a decision.
What do you want to do?
Well, Dave, hang on a sec.
I'm not real good with
people completely ignoring me.
You came out here and you said,
believe me, I'm an operator.
I bought in it right away.
I saw the passion.
And at the very end,
when I make you the <i>exact </i>offer
you're looking for,
you throw over
a better offer to mark?
I'm out.
The main reason is--
is getting $60,000
for a strategic investor.
Don't waste your breath on me.
You're not strategically
thinking, my friend.
Your hypersensitive
to the equity you're losing...
Yeah.
And you completely ignore
an offer
that doesn't cost you anything.
Why don't you counter me
with less of a royalty?
I do not want to give up
money when I need it the most.
Horrible negotiation.
I hope mark <i>does </i>do
what I think he's gonna do
to you--screw you.
Mark, if you can get down
to my negotiating range,
what's the difference?
This is one bottle of wine
for you.
Don't lose sight of
a couple percent here.
Let's do this.
Don't lose sight
of your opportunity.
Dave, why don't you get on
your knees and start groveling?
I'm making a pitch.
I'm making
an impassioned plea.
Mark, let's do this.
I understand it's only 2%,
especially since
it's $60,000.
But the flip side is,
that if we do our job right,
that 2% is gonna be worth
a lot of money,
which is why
you're fighting for it.
(exhales deeply)
um, my dad, he's--
he packs all the bottles.
Um, I'd like to give him
a quick phone call,
if you guys don't mind,
and talk about this.
I'm not going anywhere.
So... All right.
Don't change anything
while I'm gone, okay?
(laughs)
mark, I don't understand
why he's so caught up
on the extra 1 or 2%.
Because he knows
what it's gonna be worth.
He's greedy.
So Robert came in
for $60,000 at--at 5%,
it's exactly what I wanted,
but then mark came in
at a little bit higher,
basically $60,000 for 8%.
Which values the company
at $750,000.
Um, but I just think that
he's a better strategic partner.
So I'm gonna try
to talk him down or something.
I tried it once.
I'm gonna try again.
But I think he may be
the right guy to go with.
(man) Okay,
but just remember that
that price, I think,
is extremely low.
And you know what?
Don't be afraid
to walk away
from the deal, Dave.
Are you planning on meeting him
in the middle or holding steady?
No, I'm gonna hold Steady.
Then you should be thanking us
for all dropping out.
I am.
So, Dave,
you talk to your dad?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
Mark, I've thought long
and hard about it.
You're the right guy to partner
with in this business.
I'm very concerned about
equity, as I should be, right?
This is my baby, I've built it
from the ground up.
I understand.
I've been there.
Here's what I wanna do.
Help me a little bit.
Can we meet in the middle?
7%. That's a great deal.
What is <i>wrong </i>with you?
Mark, let's meet in the middle.
I'm a reasonable guy.
Two lids, one dream.
Let's do it.
Come on, mark. Come on.
He's greedier
than you are.
I have never seen such Greed.
Unbelievable.
Mark, I know you're there.
It feels so good
to say Yes.
Just say it, man.
What are you going to do,
Mr. Cuban?
I look at it
the other way around. Right?
A $1.2 million valuation.
2% of that's $24,000.
You're not valuing
my contribution.
Just bringing it
to the mavericks,
you couldn't buy that
for $24,000.
That's why I'm sticking
to my guns.
Dave, think about it.
All right. Let's do it. Let's do
it, man. What do you say?
(Barbara) Oh, thank God.
Deal! Done and done.
Congratulations, man.
You're gonna be great.
Two lids, one dream.
Two lids,
one dream, baby.
All right.
Thanks, bill. Great job.
Dangerous Play.
Dangerous play.
Wow.
Whoo!
He's a greedy pig. I love him.
Whoo!
(laughs)
I'm a lean, mean,
clean bottle machine.
Oh, knock it off.
Oh, as corny as can be.
Yes, sir!
I took a huge Gamble trying
to negotiate with mark,
but I wanted to push him
to the end.
Every percent of clean bottle
means a lot to me.
But at the end of the day,
I got a great deal.
