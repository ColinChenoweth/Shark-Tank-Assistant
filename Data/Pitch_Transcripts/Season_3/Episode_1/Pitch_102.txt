Hi. I'm Nancy Bush.
And I'm Sue kruskopf.
Our company is
my wonderful life,
and we're here today
to ask you for $100,000
for 10% of the company.
So how about a show of hands--
how many of us are gonna die?
But how many of us
tell our friends and family
exactly what we would want
for our funeral?
My wonderful life
is a free Web site
where you can plan
and personalize your own funeral
so you get the celebration
you want.
And it takes a huge burden
off of your family.
We came up with the idea
after I lost my husband
about five years ago.
And even though he was sick
for about a year,
when the time came,
we still really didn't know
what he wanted.
We ended up pulling together
a really memorable,
really celebratory, uh,
party in his honor
at one of his favorite bars.
I had people come up to me
afterwards, saying,
"how do I make sure I can have
a celebration like that?"
it was really awesome.
And had he had our site,
it would have been
so much easier
for him to let us know
what he wanted.
When Nancy and I went
online, we found--
god, there really aren't any
options to do that out there.
Further Research showed
that 75% of baby boomers,
like us, really want something
far more celebratory--
we don't want the funeral
our parents had.
The death rate is gonna double
over the next 30 years.
I mean, what a huge
business opportunity that is.
So let us show you
how it works.
Okay, Well, Kevin, since you are
Mr. Wonderful, of course...
that's so True.
It is so True.
So of course,
we have to talk
about the wonderful life
of Kevin O'Leary.
You basically go online,
you fill out an online book,
and inside are all the options
that you can have
in terms of, you know, where do
you want your funeral to be?
What kind of wine
do you want to have?
Cabernet? I mean--
and--and really,
do you want to prepay
for your funeral?
I mean, that's something
that we know
you would want to do
for Sure.
Then what you do is
you designate up to six people--
could be your fellow sharks--
who are going to
carry out your wishes.
They just Click on a Link,
and they get a summary
of everything you would have
wanted for your funeral.
It's an $11 billion
industry...
$11 Billion.
And we're gonna
lead the way.
So who's gonna join us?
I love the DEAD guy Business.
(Sue and Nancy Laugh)
For the very reasons
you've identified--
Everybody's gonna bite it.
So what's the plan
that you make money?
We're very, very excited
because we have just partnered
with one of the largest
insurance companies
in the country,
and we have developed,
uh, a product called
the my wonderful life plan.
And so people can set aside
any amount of money
to prepay
for their funeral.
It's basically like buying
an insurance policy.
So when you die,
your loved ones--
all they have to do
is print out the summary.
On the summary, it says,
"Kevin's paid for his funeral.
Here's where you can
access the money."
So does the money go to you?
We make a commission
on every sale.
Oh, I see.
So we're making about 5%
on every sale.
What's a typical sale?
If you were to put away $5,000
for your funeral,
we would make $250 on that.
Who does the money come from?
The money comes from
the insurance company,
and they hold the money,
and that money continues
to earn interest for them.
How many users
do you have today?
We have 7,000 today.
How long has the site been up?
It's been up three years.
What did you gross?
We actually have not
made any money to date.
The problem I see
with your business model
is a very small fraction
of the people
actually preplan
their funeral.
Well, is that True?
Yeah, it's True.
That is actually not True.
That is not True.
What--what percentage?
If you look at, um,
just funeral planning
in general,
25% of the people over 50
prepay in some--
but they do it with
the individual funeral home.
A lot of us don't wanna
go through a funeral home.
You can go through
a funeral home
to be cremated or whatever,
but you may just want
to have a great party,
and that money is put aside
to have a party
at your favorite place.
I get what you guys
are trying to do.
Have you signed exclusive deals
with These insurance companies?
It's not an exclusive deal.
That's a killer to me.
(Kevin) Nothing proprietary
about this.
Why can't I just set up
uncle Kevin's snuff city?
What's even worse--
I can come in and go
to those same companies
and say, you know what?
I'll take a little bit less,
but I want an exclusive.
And then all of a sudden,
you're stuck.
This was an INTERESTING idea
based on an emotional moment
in your life, Nancy.
I understand that.
But as a business plan,
I see all kinds of holes in it.
Nothing proprietary about it.
You're captured by
an insurance company,
hard to acquire customers,
competing with
the funeral homes themselves
that have no interest
in giving you any business.
We have surveyed
the members that we do have,
and 40% of them say
they want to prepay.
So this isn't something that,
you know, we're just throwing
out there in, you know,
hopes that people will...
no one saying there's not
a potential business,
the problem is,
you haven't taken
a lot of the basic business
steps to protect yourself.
In all my business,
I always ask myself,
if I was trying to kick
my own ass, what would I do?
And those are the things
you haven't done yet.
Well, and that's why we're here.
I'm out.
We have 7,000 members
right now, and bas--
they're paying you nothing.
Did any of
the 7,000 people die?
Um, yes.
And what prevented them
from paying at that point?
We didn't have that available
at that point.
I think that I'll probably be
dead before I see my money back.
I'm out.
But here's the thing, guys.
If 40%
of our 7,000 members right now
wanted to put aside--
Let's just say $5,000--
that--that immediately
generates $700,000.
But you haven't tested that.
If you had tested that model,
you've already accumulated
so many dollars in commissions,
you would have a whole
different presentation here.
But you're really here
too early.
I'm out.
If your investment
is $100,000,
we'll get 25,000
new members,
based on a $4-per-member
Acquisition.
Sue, how do you know that?
Because We've tested it.
We--we invested
some of our own money
to see how much it would cost
to get a member.
But you didn't monetize them.
And you didn't
protect it, either.
Sue, I don't think
you've even, uh,
gotten out of
the starting gate.
There's no business.
I'm out.
Kevin, come on.
Kevin.
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
It really sucked.
The most interesting
part of your pitch
is you said,
"Everybody's gonna be dead."
(singsongy) I'm listening.
And then you don't tell me how
I make any <i>money </i>from them.
Come up with a plan that
every guy that dies,
I make some money.
Then I'm in.
Aw, Goll.
That's it.
Well, I don't wanna plan
<i>your </i>funeral, Kevin.
(laughter)
I'm never gonna die.
I'm a vampire.
I'm out.
Aw. All right.
Thanks for your time.
All right.
Thanks for your time.
Good luck, Ladies.
Ugh. I hated it.
