My name is Michael Levin
and my company
is businessghost.
I'm asking for $200,000
in exchange for 10%
of the company.
I'm a writer.
In fact, I've done
more than 100 books.
My work has been made into
tv shows and movies,
and has appeared
on "The New York times"
Best seller list.
But chances are
you've never heard of me.
That's because
I'm a ghostwriter.
I help people tell their Stories
from behind the scenes.
My clients include some of
the top C.E.O.S in America,
major sports figures,
top broadcasters,
and celebrities.
Just about everybody
has a dream
of becoming
a published author.
At businessghost,
we make that dream come True.
Here's how it works.
You come to us
with the need for a story.
Our team will organize it,
write it,
design it, publish it,
and market it--
one-stop shopping.
I can see businessghost
becoming the leading provider
of ghostwritten books
in the United States.
But I can only make that happen
with your expertise
and your capital.
Who's interested?
I understand the business model
of one ghostwriter.
Right.
I'm trying to understand,
how does that work
on a larger scale?
Well,
that's a great question.
The first name of
the company is "Business."
Most of our clients are
businesspeople,
are entrepreneurs,
and there are tens of millions
of businesses
in the United States.
Basically, we have
a writing team of eight writers.
The writers do
the interviewing.
We have a chief creative OFFICER
Who oversees their work.
It's my job
to bring in the work.
How much
do you charge for that?
We charge anywhere
between $35,000
and $75,000.
Does that include
a run of the book?
Yes. That includes the--
the--the printing of the books
so that they've got
actual physical books.
And how many copies
of the hardcover book?
You get 50 to 100 copies
of the book.
So how do you acquire
new customers?
Is it all referral business?
It's mostly referral business
up to this point, Yes.
We're averaging about
two books a month right now.
Honestly, we're doing about
$650,000 to $700,000 gross
this year.
Mike, you've achieved
what every writer never gets--
profitability.
But I don't know if this
is a leveragable business.
I don't know
if you can turn it
into a $5 million-a-year
business.
You're basically selling
vanity printing.
In other words, I'm a guy,
I want a book,
I can't get a U.S. Publisher
to pick me up,
I come to you,
you bang out 100 copies,
costs me 35 grand.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I cringe
a tiny bit on the inside
when I hear the word
"Vanity."
But yes, we are making
a marketing tool
disguised as a book.
We tell our clients,
your income stream
is not gonna be revenue
derived from the sale
of the book.
Use the book to build
your business.
Why aren't you interested
in the people
who wanna write about
their dog and their friend,
and the story they had
growing up?
It may not necessarily
be business-related.
Why are you staying
away from that?
Because then you open yourself
up to a much bigger market.
Right.
Right. Daymond--the first thing
I wanna say, daymond,
is that I-I loved your book,
"display of power."
I love the way
you suck up.
You're next. Anyway...
(laughter)
You're good...
you like that?
(singsongy) as a schmoozer.
(laughs)
Where was I? Daymond--
why aren't you opening up
to the masses?
You know, it's--
it's about quality.
It's about the integrity
of the quality.
I'm putting my name
on every book.
Not everybody in the country
can afford a book.
I cannot do a book at $10,000
and make money on it.
Mike, I've--I've heard
your business model.
I understand it.
But to scale this business,
to take it public,
to make it liquid,
for me to get back
my $200,000,
regardless of what percentage
of the business I take,
I see as
a very difficult challenge.
I don't see how I'm going
to make any money here.
I'm out.
Well, in that case,
I'm not gonna
schmooze you anymore.
(sharks laugh)
Oh, I like this guy.
You know, the question
about scalability
is incredibly important.
running the company...
to do what?
To do what?
To give
the business direction.
I'm the classic example
of the entrepreneur
who has taken something
as far as he can
and has reached
knucklehead Status.
Michael, you can't offload
the responsibility
of coming up
with the right strategy.
That's where
it falls apart for me.
The best salesman
in your company,
the guy who's responsible
for a strategy, has to be you.
I'm out.
Okay.
I-I appreciate that.
Um, you know,
I-I still think
that just about anybody
on the planet
could do a better job
of running my business
then I--well, that's--that--
that's too self-deprecating.
I wanna address that
if I could.
Please.
I've found, in the many
years of experience I have,
the minute someone Running
any business, large or small,
starts talking about
getting a C.E.O.,
It's code for "I'm tired
of my business,
"and what should really
be happening is
I should be going
into a different business."
So I'm out.
I think if I invested
into this business,
getting my money back
will end up being
a mystery book.
I'm out.
Well--well stated.
Punch to the Gut.
Okay.
Mark, it's, uh,
just the two of us.
There's a lot that I like
about your business.
And literally--you, right?
You're a hustler.
Where I have
significant problems
is you didn't really address
the specific changes
in your industry.
There's a real
fundamental question as to
whether or not people will even
publish Books going forward.
That's exactly right.
I think the book itself
as a tool of
disseminating information,
sadly, is all but disappearing
in society.
And ironically,
in an era when books
are Harder and Harder
to make money on,
a business owner who has
one of our books
is gonna stand out
even more from the crowd
because there's something
so wonderfully old-school
and significant
about a book.
And that's--that's--
that's my pitch.
That is the linchpin of
the future of your business?
That's correct.
To me, that has
the future potential
of investing in
a weightlifting snowman.
A weightlifting snowman?
You think about that.
Now if this was 1995,
I probably would have invested.
I'm out.
All right. Thank you, Mike.
Thank you, all, so much.
Good luck, Mike.
What's with
a weightlifting snowman?
Think about it, Barbara.
(laughter)
