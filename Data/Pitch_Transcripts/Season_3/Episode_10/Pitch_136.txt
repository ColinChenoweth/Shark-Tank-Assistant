My name is Desiree Estrada,
and this is my partner,
Arlene battishill.
And we are gogo gear.
We are here today to ask you
for a $300,000 investment
in return for 15% equity.
Gogo gear is
a line of fully protective
safety wear
for people who ride
scooters and motorcycles.
(Arlene)
But very fashionable.
Desiree and I used to ride
to work,
and we were in business suits,
and there is no way
either one of us
or anybody else in the world
that wears business SUITS
or has to be dressed up
to go somewhere
is gonna wear
something like this.
So we're out there riding
with nothing protective.
In, uh, 2008, We both lost
our corporate jobs,
and I said to Desiree,
"I have a great idea.
"Let's take all of our money
and invest it in something
we know nothing about."
(laughs)
Yeah!
(all laugh)
It's the Kevin O'Leary
school of business.
(desirée) yes!
I'm gonna give you $300,000
of Daymond's money right now.
(all laugh)
This is gogo Gear.
Is gogo gear.
(mark) There you go.
Ooh.
(Barbara) Wow.
Now we're talking, baby.
(daymond) Ohh.
We will wear this to work.
(mark) Yowza, yowza.
I am telling you.
This is fully protective,
fully armored,
abrasion-Resistant
safety wear for motorcycle
and scooter Riders.
(Robert) really?
That jacket is...
you bet.
Every jacket
that you see here
contains protective armor
in the back, shoulders,
and in the elbows.
(Kevin) What are your sales?
We have $172,000 in sales
for last year.
So you design it,
and you send it,
and you outsource it?
Mm-hmm. Yes.
We are operating out of
our home. Very low Overhead.
Who's carrying it?
Right now, they're exclusively
held in motorcycle
and scooter Stores.
Total retail stores
are 25.
And do either of you have any
kind of a fashion background?
No, we don't.
We both have extensive
management background.
We have been businesswomen
for over 25 years.
Let me tell you,
that looks Good.
Okay, so this is a 1-Year event
so far. You're newbies.
Show me I can trust you
with my money.
What are you gonna do
with my money?
Well, we're going
to Europe.
That's not the right answer.
On a vacation?
Wrong Answer.
Big-Time wrong.
(laughter)
No, no, no, no, no.
Here's the thing--
in the United States,
There are 7 million
registered bikes.
But the big market
for our product is in Europe,
because you've got 35 million
registered riders there--
That is a horrible,
horrible,
horrible, horrible--
did I say that was
a horrible answer?
And I'll tell you why.
How many people
are in your company?
Two.
You're working out of
your house.
Yep.
What happens to your business
in your 25 stores
when you guys are both in Europe
trying to figure everything out?
When you grow a business,
it's a babysitting process.
It's like having a child,
right?
Mm-Hmm.
You haven't even hired
your first employee,
and you're already
leaving the country and--
(Arlene) No, that's not
the case. That's not True.
We have made a significant
number of contacts
in the industry overseas.
Again, the same problem--
they do the work for us.
Are you profitable yet?
Well, we would've been
profitable,
except we went to Europe.
Yeah, we've made a lot
of mistakes with our money.
So, Arlene, now you want to make
a mistake on our dime?
No, no, no, no.
See, that's the benefit.
A lot of the mistakes
that we made,
we will not make again.
Okay, Desiree, you said
you put all your money in.
How much was all of that
when you started?
We invested, of our own money,
close to $400,000.
How much do you have left?
Less--a little less
than $100,000.
Let me
ask you ladies something.
Everybody agrees
the Product's good.
Would you agree
to allow me to put
an ankle bracelet
on each of you,
and every time
you said "Europe,"
you got a 50-Volt shock?
(laughs)
(laughs)
(Robert) So, Desiree,
I love motorcycles,
but in one of the rare moments
that I actually
want to listen to daymond,
he's the clothing guy.
(Arlene) Yeah.
He has the expertise.
Daymond, what do you think
of this business?
I think that We're ignoring
the bigger Issue.
Which is
the insane valuation?
Yeah, so, you guys,
did you eat or drink Anything
before midnight last night?
'cause we're about to do
some Surgery.
Let Mr. Wonderful help you,
because you said earlier--
Well, Desiree--
You said earlier that you were
both businesswomen.
In your industry,
companies are valued at
five times free cash flow, okay?
That's a great value
for a big company.
One that's successful,
has market share,
people know the brand,
none of which you have.
I'm not stupid.
Desiree, look,
that's bad.
Don't come in here,
agree with us that the value
of your business is too high,
and then ask us
what we think.
Well, I haven't agreed--
This is your chance.
You're standing there
asking for money.
Think about it and tell me
what you really think
the business is worth.
(mark) They're telling you
it's worth nothing
because they don't know
what to do,
and they want us to do it
for 'em.
(Arlene)
No, we do know what to do.
(sharks all talking at once)
mark, I'm giving 'em
one more chance.
We just don't have
the money to do it.
(daymond) He's giving you
a chance.
All right, look,
we need some help here.
You think?
(daymond) Go ahead.
Wait. We're dropping out quick.
You better hurry up. Say it.
We have started something
brand-New...
get to the number.
That has never
been thought of before.
Hurry up.
Get to the number.
25% equity.
No, that's not high enough.
Get to the number.
I'd say the number would be--
the final Number would be
about 38%.
(mark laughs) 38%.
(Barbara) 38.
You know what?
You make that decision
the same way you make
every other decision.
Whoomp.
No, we talked about it
before we left.
You took $400,000,
and over the last 2 years,
you haven't been able
to sit down
and define a direct strategy
That's gonna
get you to a point
of profitability and growth.
And I hate to paraphrase
the undertaker over here,
but you know what?
Any brand that has any interest
in this business,
since you have
nothing proprietary,
could just come in and crush you
like the cockroaches you are.
(daymond and Kevin) Yeah!
Well, all right then.
(desirée) Oh, well.
I am out.
Aww.
I am so out,
I am, like, in europe
looking back at you guys.
(Arlene) Wow. People.
We have got something
that is so innovative.
We don't want to leave
"Shark tank" Without a deal.
Arlene, when you have a product
that's extremely innovative,
but unfortunately,
can be ripped off very easily,
what is the one quality that
you absolutely have to have
in order to be successful?
Absolute laser-Like focus.
Bang.
Here's my market.
I've got motorcycle dealers.
I need 25, I need 35,
I need 45.
Go, go, go.
My biggest fear
with you guys
is that you're not focused.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Wow.
All right, daymond.
You know this business.
We also...
are willing to bring
our equity offer up.
(Arlene) You love the product.
I mean--
I love the PRODUCT,
Arlene,
and that is the only reason
I'm still talking to you.
But my challenge is...
(desirée)
and we're listening to you.
Every time you get asked
a business question,
I hear dreams, I hear hopes,
I hear future.
It's great.
(Arlene)
Like every entrepreneur.
But I gotta hear Business.
That's my Concern.
That's why they need us,
Rob.
That's why
we need you.
We burned through
that $400,00,
and I take responsibility
to that,
because I had a big dream
that we could do this
where we have
distributors interested
in us in Italy...
All right.
In Europe.
Okay, but--
(Robert) Arlene.
Yeah?
The--the--
my bad. My bad, Robert.
(daymond)
Arlene, just--
Come on. Come back
to the table, baby!
But there you are again!
There you are again!
(laughs)
(daymond) rob, this--
400 grand. "My bad."
I just pissed it away, right?
Yeah. No. I didn't do that.
Hey, you know what, Arlene?
$400,000 was a lot of money
to me when I didn't have any.
It's still a lot of money!
It's still
a lot of money to me.
It's still a lot
of money.
I can't do it 'cause you're
throwing that money away.
If daymond wants to throw
his money away,
I'm gonna let him do it.
I'm out.
Ugh.
Ohh.
We--
We were willing to,
you know,
refocus our business.
We are willing to--
to grow our business.
We actually have
a marketing plan for the U.S.
(daymond) guys, listen.
Robert's out.
But I got good news
for you. I'm in.
Whoo!
Aah!
I can't believe it.
Damn.
Thank you!
Oh, my goodness!
All right, so now
I'm betting on you guys.
Don't make me look bad.
We won't.
Not a chance.
All right.
We won't.
Thank you.
Thank you, sharks!
(mark)
Congratulations, ladies.
(laughing)
(Arlene) God!
(Barbara) You're my hero.
Whoo-Hoo!
Oh, god.
(laughing) We got it.
I'm glad we had
our protective armor on,
because we sure took
a beating out there,
but at the end of the day,
we got what we wanted.
And we wanted a deal
with daymond,
and we're ready to go.
