My name is Desiree Estrada,
(Arlene)
But very fashionable.
(Arlene) No, that's not
the case. That's not True.
We have made a significant
number of contacts
in the industry overseas.
Again, the same problem--
they do the work for us.
Are you profitable yet?
Well, we would've been
profitable,
except we went to Europe.
Yeah, we've made a lot
of mistakes with our money.
So, Arlene, now you want to make
a mistake on our dime?
No, no, no, no.
See, that's the benefit.
A lot of the mistakes
that we made,
we will not make again.
Okay, Desiree, you said
you put all your money in.
How much was all of that
when you started?
We invested, of our own money,
close to $400,000.
How much do you have left?
Less--a little less
than $100,000.
Let me
ask you ladies something.
Everybody agrees
the Product's good.
Would you agree
to allow me to put
an ankle bracelet
on each of you,
(Robert) So, Desiree,
I love motorcycles,
but in one of the rare moments
that I actually
want to listen to daymond,
he's the clothing guy.
(Arlene) Yeah.
He has the expertise.
Daymond, what do you think
of this business?
I think that We're ignoring
the bigger Issue.
Which is
the insane valuation?
Yeah, so, you guys,
did you eat or drink Anything
before midnight last night?
'cause we're about to do
some Surgery.
Let Mr. Wonderful help you,
because you said earlier--
Well, Desiree--
You said earlier that you were
both businesswomen.
In your industry,
companies are valued at
five times free cash flow, okay?
That's a great value
for a big company.
One that's successful,
Desiree, look,
that's bad.
Don't come in here,
agree with us that the value
of your business is too high,
(Arlene)
No, we do know what to do.
(sharks all talking at once)
mark, I'm giving 'em
one more chance.
We just don't have
the money to do it.
(daymond) He's giving you
a chance.
All right, look,
we need some help here.
You think?
(daymond) Go ahead.
Wait. We're dropping out quick.
You better hurry up. Say it.
(Arlene) Wow. People.
We have got something
that is so innovative.
We don't want to leave
"Shark tank" Without a deal.
Arlene, when you have a product
that's extremely innovative,
but unfortunately,
can be ripped off very easily,
what is the one quality that
you absolutely have to have
in order to be successful?
Absolute laser-Like focus.
Bang.
Here's my market.
I've got motorcycle dealers.
I need 25, I need 35,
I need 45.
Go, go, go.
My biggest fear
with you guys
is that you're not focused.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Wow.
All right, daymond.
You know this business.
We also...
are willing to bring
our equity offer up.
(Arlene) You love the product.
I mean--
I love the PRODUCT,
Arlene,
It's great.
(Arlene)
Like every entrepreneur.
But I gotta hear Business.
That's my Concern.
That's why they need us,
Rob.
That's why
we need you.
We burned through
that $400,00,
Okay, but--
(Robert) Arlene.
Yeah?
The--the--
my bad. My bad, Robert.
(daymond)
Arlene, just--
Come on. Come back
to the table, baby!
But there you are again!
There you are again!
(laughs)
Hey, you know what, Arlene?
$400,000 was a lot of money
to me when I didn't have any.
It's still a lot of money!
It's still
a lot of money to me.
It's still a lot
of money.
I can't do it 'cause you're
throwing that money away.
If daymond wants to throw
his money away,
I'm gonna let him do it.
I'm out.
Ugh.
Ohh.
We--
We were willing to,
you know,
refocus our business.
We are willing to--
to grow our business.
We actually have
a marketing plan for the U.S.
(daymond) guys, listen.
Robert's out.
But I got good news
for you. I'm in.
Whoo!
Aah!
I can't believe it.
Damn.
Thank you!
Oh, my goodness!
All right, so now
I'm betting on you guys.
Don't make me look bad.
We won't.
Not a chance.
All right.
We won't.
Thank you.
Thank you, sharks!
(mark)
Congratulations, ladies.
(laughing)
(Arlene) God!
(Barbara) You're my hero.
Whoo-Hoo!
Oh, god.
(laughing) We got it.
I'm glad we had
our protective armor on,
because we sure took
a beating out there,
but at the end of the day,
we got what we wanted.
