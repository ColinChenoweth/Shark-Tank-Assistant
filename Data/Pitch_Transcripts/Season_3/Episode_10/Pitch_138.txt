My name is Nick Romero.
I'm 30 years old, and I live
in Venice beach, california.
My name is Nick Romero,
and I'm the owner of the ave.
I'm here to ask for $125,000
in exchange
for 15% of my business.
We are living
in the digital era.
Current technology has created
so many different ways
for people to create
their own music,
they're own art,
they're own photography.
Now more than ever,
people have a need
to express themselves.
And one way in which
young people in particular
are desperately trying to show
their individuality
is through their clothing.
That's why I created
the ave.
The ave will be
the first retail chain
in the entire world
that will allow you
to custom create
any article of clothing
that can be made
within minutes.
It'll be a place where you
can turn your images,
your ideas, and your slogans
into wearable art,
from head to toe.
Right now,
our most popular Product
is getting your favorite style
of shoe completely customized.
Let me show you
how that's done.
We can take any image--
Like you guys here--
or images.
We can completely redesign it
for you.
All you gotta do--Pick out
your favorite style of shoe.
So, Nick,
how much does it cost?
For a custom shoe with your
images, we charge 100 Bucks.
Including the cost
of the shoe?
That's right.
And what does that
cost you to do,
including the cost
of printing?
It costs about $27, $28.
(Robert) Including the shoe?
That's correct.
So, Nick, this all comes down
to the machine.
It actually c--
Not the machine,
it actually comes down
to this platen,
because no one in the world
is doing this,
and no one can do this
because--
to the what, Nick? Sorry.
We call it a platen.
It's this metal device--
(mark) bladen?
That holds the shoe up,
and what I've done is,
I've created a template
for each size.
So the printer
will actually know
exactly where to spray
the ink.
So there are
how many different styles?
Right.
Well, there's all these here.
You know, we've got,
you know, these slip-On shoes,
we've got the boots there,
also these shoes up here.
You can see--You know, what--
got it. Okay.
Right.
So then you made
the modifications to this.
Right.
And so anybody can come in
with any picture,
anything at all?
Right.
I mean, we--
We've gone as far--
We've taken pictures
of people's tattoos
right in the store,
cut it out on photoshop,
printed it on their shoes.
How long does it take?
Less than 30 minutes.
Do I really need
a retail store?
Why isn't this
a complete online business?
Well, we've been V--
My store
is only 450 square feet.
It's tiny.
We've generated $570,000
since we opened,
which was
in mid April of last year.
$570,000...
that's right.
In your first year?
That's right.
You didn't mention
anything about profit.
The profit was $150,000.
So how are you gonna
make this a chain?
It's gonna be done
in phases, okay?
Phase One is where
We're at now, small scale.
450 Square feet
is not a lot of space
when this enormous printer
is taking up--
So you want to make
bigger stores?
The--Phase two is to open up
a bigger store,
release the other shoe styles
that we have the technology for,
then at that point, I want
to look into franchising.
How many machines do you have
in the store, one?
We have one.
Right, so you can't make
that many
if it takes
up to 30 minutes, right?
Okay, here's the thing--
Each Retail store
is open regular hours
just like any retail store,
but at night, they turn into
fulfillment centers.
You see
this button right here?
Right. But you see what I'm--
this--hold on. Hang on.
This button is green
for a reason--
Because every time we press it,
we make money.
(mark laughs)
right?
Oh, I like that.
(laughs)
Nick, how much does
the printer cost you?
It cost $55,000.
You altered the Printer.
Can anybody else do that?
No. We've--like I said,
we've got these in--
--In patent pending right now,
so, I mean...
then why aren't we leasing
this printer
to everybody in the country
or the world--
Why would you
ignore the fact--
I started a business--
I'm gonna ignore it
because I've backed
about four or five
REALLY cool brands like yours,
and they're usually cool
and they're broke.
But We're not a brand.
There's two types of people
in this world.
There's either sharks
and the rest of the people
who want to be sharks.
That's it.
(laughs)
and I'm trying to get you
to be a shark.
Okay.
Right? So if this technology
is Good enough
where we can lease people
the printer for $100,000
and get a percentage--
I don't care if they do
just their families,
they do bar mitzvah--
I don't care what they do.
That's one thing,
but the--the other part of it
that I--that we haven't
really talked about yet
that I think is Really important
is licensing images, right?
When you walk into an ave,
you're gonna see
touch screens
all over the wall
with thousands--
Thousands of images
that people can just sit there
and go through.
They can spend hours...
(daymond) Nick, you know what?
Looking at pictures...
Nick.
And looking
at different stuff--
Nick, Nick, hold it
one second.
You're trying to work hard
instead of working smart.
I think you're--
You're incredibly cool,
but I've lost a lot of money
with the cool guys.
They're still cool, but not--
and I was broke, you know,
after--After investing in 'em,
so with that, I'm out.
(mark) He's right,
but that doesn't diminish
the opportunity.
The question is,
what's the special sauce?
And that's, what'd you call it,
your platum or--
Platen.
Yeah, your platen, right?
And that's what's unique.
And if you can take that
and market it to other people
and let them do all the work,
you can have fun with the ave
and make money off the ave,
and that's all good--
That's the problem
with this deal.
Everybody has a different
version of the business model,
including you.
Well, no,
it's the same version.
It's the same version,
it's just, where's the leverage?
I think Nick Sees the leverage
as being open up a lot of stores
'cause it's cool and hip
and we'll grow it, right?
What's proprietary
is that single plate
that holds those shoes in place.
(Robert) Mark's got
the big picture down here.
I think the problem is, Nick is
seeing the little picture today.
That concerns me a lot.
I don't want to change
the guy's business model,
and at this point,
for me,
I'm out.
Now look,
here's the thing you guys--
I just want to make
a ton of money. That's it.
I'm already to the point where I
have employees doing the work.
I'm never
in the store anymore.
I'm trying to grow it.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm in front of you,
and that's why I'm here,
to say I want to have
a partner that has done it.
You guys have done it.
And at the end of the day,
it's all about money.
Right, Mr. Wonderful?
That's so True,
my friend.
I'm listening to you,
and you're saying,
"look, I want to do retail,
I want to license images."
I-I appreciate the fact
you have $500,000 in Sales.
That's interesting.
But the rest of it's moving
parts to me, and I hate retail,
so I'm out.
Okay.
(Barbara) I love
your enthusiasm, okay?
But you know what I think?
I think you're in love
with the retail business.
I think you heard
a couple of great ideas
to really make money
on this business,
and you're "Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah,"
but I don't think
you're really listening,
so I'm out.
So it's me and you, baby.
(laughs)
What are we doing?
Let's do something, mark.
