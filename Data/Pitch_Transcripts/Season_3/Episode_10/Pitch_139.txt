My name is Steve Albert,
and these are my partners.
I'm Larry Blackwell.
And I'm Jason Conroy.
We are seeking $125,000
for a 15% equity share
in our company--
the Brewer's cow
beer infused ice cream.
(chuckles)
(Steve) I have been making
super-Premium ice cream
for over ten years now.
I started an experiment
in the pairing
of two of Life's
greatest pleasures--
Beer and ice cream.
Today the Brewer's cow
reverse engineers the beer,
rendering it alcohol-Free.
We then add
other ingredients to it,
typical of what
a craft Brewer would use,
and we blend it
with our premium cream.
Our ideas for flavors
are only limited
by the amount of good beer
out there.
And we all know, there's
a lot of good beer out there.
(Jason) Sharks, partnering
with you will allow us
to take this company
to the next level.
We hope to have
our beer-Infused ice cream
in supermarkets nationwide.
Our unique niche will allow us
to break into
this highly competitive market
of ice cream.
Even a 1% share of that market
would make this company
a multi-Multi-Million-Dollar
company.
(Jason)
We're ice cream makers.
We're ice cream makers.
(Robert) I hear you,
but there are certain things
in every business,
you gotta know
every morning when you wake up,
and one of them is,
what do I need to do
in order to break even.
For that reason, I'm out.
(mark)
You guys have challenges.
You gotta sell thousands
and thousands of pints
in order for us to even
think about getting a return.
You might be better off going to
the big ice cream companies
and licensing your product.
That's your opportunity,
but I can't be an investor,
because you'd have to sell
so many pints of ice cream,
it would take too much capital,
so for that reason, I'm out.
I'm out 'cause I think you guys
are ice cream bozos.
No national Chain's
ever gonna pick this up.
We respect your decision,
but I think we're gonna
go forward.
(Robert) So are we all out?
Yeah, I think we're all out.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
Let's go get a beer.
Who's in?
Did you like the ice cream?
Yes.
I didn't.
(Jason) We're ice cream makers.
We're not accountants.
We were looking for somebody
to kind of help us out
with that end of it,
uh, so we could take care
of the ice cream end of it,
which we know is awesome.
And, uh, we're gonna
prove 'em wrong Anyway.
