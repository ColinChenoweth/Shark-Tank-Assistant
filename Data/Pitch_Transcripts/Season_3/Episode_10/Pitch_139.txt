I am Blake St. Clair,
entrepreneur, designer,
(mark) Blake, let me ask you
a couple of questions.
Yes.
This is basically
lunchables for a pet, right?
Exactly.
So, Blake, why wouldn't I,
as a dog owner,
simply take a baggie,
Pending.
See, Blake, I think
it's a good idea,
because when I travel
with the dog, right now
you gotta grab this food, you
gotta throw it in a plastic bag.
It's--It's just
a lot of work.
The other thing
I really like is,
for a large food company,
it's just another way
for them to sell product.
Have you made
any of those calls?
I have tried personally
to contact
a few different
pet food vendors,
Blake, I'm gonna say--
I'm gonna say--
Blake, the only play here
is the packaging, right?
That's what you're suggesting?
(Blake) That is correct.
Right.
Oh.
(Kevin) I'll make it
real easy.
This idea
has absolutely no merit,
You know, Blake, obviously,
you're early in the process.
You're offering 51%
of the company.
There's a lot of work
to be done,
and actually, uh,
my dog's name is Blake.
(laughs)
really?
Yes, really.
But I'm out.
I don't think
you have a problem
with Putting dry food
in a baggie.
I do it with my dog
for a day--
slam it in the baggie.
Then I use the same bag
to clean up after him.
I don't think people
are gonna spend the money
to solve a problem that
doesn't exist, so I'm out.
All right.
Thank you much.
Don't miss this opportunity,
Robert.
Uh, well--
at $2.50, I can't see
how it wouldn't
simply be just
a-a convenience.
Blake, un-Unlike my...
evil twin here,
(mark)
We're all about, Blake.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Best of Luck.
Good luck with everything.
Could I have my dog back?
No, you can't. We love him.
(daymond) No, he's hanging.
All right.
He was out, too.
So can I have $100,000
for 51% of the dog?
You're selling the dog now?
(mark) Oh, man!
(Robert) He's joking.
Oh, man.
Thank you so much.
(Barbara) Thank you, Blake.
(daymond) All right. Thank you.
(mark) All right.
Good luck with Everything.
Love the Dog.
(mark) Thanks, Blake.
Thank you.
(Barbara) Thank you.
(daymond) Thank you.
