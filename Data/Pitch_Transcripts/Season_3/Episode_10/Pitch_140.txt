I am Blake St. Clair,
entrepreneur, designer,
and creator of the first-Ever
full-Serving meal
for your favorite pet.
I am asking $100,000
for a 51% stake in my company.
People love their animals,
travel with them everywhere,
and yet, there's still not
an easy way to feed on the go.
(mark) Blake, let me ask you
a couple of questions.
Yes.
This is basically
lunchables for a pet, right?
Exactly.
And it could be applied
to other pets as well, right?
That is correct.
So, Blake, why wouldn't I,
as a dog owner,
simply take a baggie,
throw some dried pet food in it,
and take it with me?
What's the difference?
What value are you adding
with that packaging?
You could easily do that,
and that's what most people do
right now all the time.
So then why are you
solving a problem at all?
This product probably has
no market whatsoever.
Because you wouldn't have to
travel with the entire--
All the extra stuff.
No, but wouldn't I just--
if they have
two different flavors
of dried whatever it is
that they like,
I'll throw both of those
into the bag,
and when the dog's hungry,
I'll just
open the bag,
let 'em eat it.
It's not necessarily
for everyday use.
It could be as a novelty,
it could be for weekend use,
or just as a convenience,
like if you're
gonna go Camping.
Uh, you're going camping
for three days.
Yeah, but I mean,
I'm questioning
the viability
of your whole idea.
I think there May be
zero value here.
Absolutely Nobody
would buy this.
I don't know why
anybody would need this.
(Robert) But, uh, you know what?
I-I got--I gotta tell you,
I have a dog.
Uh, it's--It's not a bad idea.
It's a great way to package it.
Is there a--some form
of patent on this?
There is.
I have a patent pending
and I've also trademarked
the name.
You--you have
a patent on it?
Pending.
I do, Indeed.
Pending.
See, Blake, I think
it's a good idea,
because when I travel
with the dog, right now
you gotta grab this food, you
gotta throw it in a plastic bag.
It's--It's just
a lot of work.
The other thing
I really like is,
for a large food company,
it's just another way
for them to sell product.
Have you made
any of those calls?
I have tried personally
to contact
a few different
pet food vendors,
and I have not gotten anywhere
with my research.
You know why?
'cause it's a worthless idea.
(laughs)
You know what? You can just
kick him in the head.
No, you don't.
And like I say,
I've presented this
to hundreds of people...
Hey, rummy...
and not anybody has said
that it was a worthless idea.
Kill.
Well, now you found the truth.
I-I would like to say
that many people say that
they would buy it themselves.
Um, old and young,
uh, all--
but have--
Has anybody bought it?
No, this is
a prototype only.
It's a prototype?
It has not been marketed.
It has never been for sale.
(Barbara) What do you
sell that for?
What would the stores
sell that for?
It would sell for between
$2.50 and $3.00 a package.
And how much would
it cost you to make it?
It costs 64 cents
to make the package.
(daymond) the food as well?
That's the food
not included.
The food
would have to be licensed
to a pet food company
with the package
as
the--the--the ultimate design.
Blake, I'm gonna say--
I'm gonna say--
Blake, the only play here
is the packaging, right?
That's what you're suggesting?
(Blake) That is correct.
Right.
Oh.
(Kevin) I'll make it
real easy.
This idea
has absolutely no merit,
and it's completely worthless.
Do not quit your day job.
I'm out.
Thank you.
What are you
thanking me for?
(chuckles) I just
told you the truth.
Because he's--
because he's well-Mannered.
You know, Blake, obviously,
you're early in the process.
You're offering 51%
of the company.
There's a lot of work
to be done,
and I really don't think
I can help you.
I'm out.
and actually, uh,
my dog's name is Blake.
(laughs)
really?
Yes, really.
But I'm out.
I don't think
you have a problem
with Putting dry food
in a baggie.
I do it with my dog
for a day--
slam it in the baggie.
Then I use the same bag
to clean up after him.
I don't think people
are gonna spend the money
to solve a problem that
doesn't exist, so I'm out.
All right.
Thank you much.
Don't miss this opportunity,
Robert.
Uh, well--
at $2.50, I can't see
how it wouldn't
simply be just
a-a convenience.
Blake, un-Unlike my...
evil twin here,
I do have animals,
and I love my animals,
and I do think
it's a great idea.
You're way too early.
You're <i>way</i> too early.
You gotta get some interest
from a licensing perspective.
You can do that.
Pick up the phone. You created
this product. Keep going.
Right.
Love the dog.
I'm out for the business.
Thank you.
(mark)
We're all about, Blake.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Best of Luck.
Good luck with everything.
Could I have my dog back?
No, you can't. We love him.
(daymond) No, he's hanging.
All right.
He was out, too.
So can I have $100,000
for 51% of the dog?
You're selling the dog now?
(mark) Oh, man!
(Robert) He's joking.
Oh, man.
Thank you so much.
(Barbara) Thank you, Blake.
(daymond) All right. Thank you.
(mark) All right.
Good luck with Everything.
Love the Dog.
(mark) Thanks, Blake.
Thank you.
(Barbara) Thank you.
(daymond) Thank you.
(Steve) sharks,
our barmaid Claire
is gonna serve you
some samples
of our bavarian brittle.
Yes, for you.
Guten tag, Claire.
(mark) Oh.
Cheers.
Okay, guys. Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh, wow.
You guys did it--
ice cream and beer,
and it tastes Good.
Put a lot of hard work
into that recipe.
(daymond) So, guys,
I'm lactose intolerant, so...
if I taste that, then
the whole room will clear out,
and instead of doing that,
I'm out.
