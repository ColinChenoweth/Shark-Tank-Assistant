My name is Ben wood.
My company is viewsport.
I'm seeking $500,000 in exchange
for 20% equity in my company.
Anyone working out,
be it at home, in the gym,
or in a training camp,
wants to see results.
That's why they do it.
But to get results,
you need to push yourself,
and more often than not,
we're willing to buy
whatever gear necessary
to help us achieve
these results.
That's why I created
viewsport.
Viewsport
sweat activated technology
is built into the fabric
of t-Shirts, so when you sweat,
a secret logo appears
in the shirt.
It's motivation...
(chuckles)
Through perspiration.
Mm.
Here's how it works.
Cody begins his workout.
He starts to perspire.
Fast-Forward 20 minutes
into Cody's workout.
(spritzing)
(chuckles)
His shirt just became
personal motivation,
and you can customize
any of these shirts
to have whatever logo
you like appear.
When you need
that extra boost,
that extra push
in your workout,
viewsport's gonna do it
for you.
Ben--
You have to sweat to see
the imprint.
No, you don't. That's the beauty
of the technology.
Mm-hmm.
Think kids in water parks.
Spray the shirt down,
and secret logos
or graphics appear.
Well, then you have
to be wet to actually see
what follows...
you have to be wet.
Ben, would
this model work...
and--Mm.
If you simply gave me
the chemical
or a way to make
the chemical? Like--
That's the endgame.
We want to license
this technology out.
Do you need to have--
Have you approached
any companies
about a licensing deal?
We have.
Hurley is very interested
in the product right now.
I have a question about
the sweat factor.
I can work out for two hours
and barely sweat.
How hard do you have
to sweat--
You're not working out
hard enough.
A 20-Minute workout
for an average individual
will produce the results
that you need.
So the logo goes away
pretty quickly, Ben.
Yeah. Unfortunately,
you sweat from the inside,
so when you spray it
from the outside,
the effect isn't as good.
Okay, so let's see it work.
(spritzes)
I don't--I'm sorry.
I don't know.
I'm not seeing a whole lot.
I don't know there.
(chuckles) Yeah, um...
(chuckles) I--
have you had any complaints
from customers that
it wasn't as visible--
Not at all. This is--
This never happens.
This is falling apart
right here.
Come on, Ben.
You got one foot in the tank
and another
on a banana Peel.
There you can see.
See, I still can't see
the, uh...
well, I can read it.
"stronger. Be stronger."
The "stronger" Part
doesn't come out
as strong.
Ben, let me see it.
Is the material a cotton?
Can you make that--
can I do it
on 100% cotton?
That's a polyester.
We could do it on 100% cotton.
Ben, can that secondary word
"Stronger" be in black?
Can it pop like
your original logo?
It's all monochromatic.
I'm working on colors right now.
No.
So what is
the half a million dollars--
What are you gonna
use it on?
Well, the idea is to drive
awareness of the technology,
go--Having people go
into the nikes, the hurleys
of the world.
A sales team.
A sales team, and when people
understand the technology
and the word gets out,
it's organic growth.
I know,
but we're paying right now,
and they don't know
anything now about it.
I know, but--
y-You don't see a problem
with that?
No, I-I understand,
But the reality is,
if you look at our sales
and you annualize them,
we're looking at about
a half a million
by the end of the year.
So then you wouldn't need
our money.
No, but I do.
I need your relationships.
So I'm working for my money,
once I give it to you.
You see the technology.
There's a value in this.
Obviously you see
something here.
I think--I think you do.
I'm out.
We just got a p.O.
For the U.S. Naval academy.
They're gonna order
1,500 shirts now,
1,500 shirts
in the next month.
1,500?
Ben, you're a chemist.
Let's reverse engineer
the equation
for this value, okay?
(mouths word)
What should I be making
in a company
that I want to sell somebody
for $2 1/2 million?
$500,000.
What do you--Right.
Yeah.
How much are you making?
We did $140,000 so far.
You're making squat.
He's charging you
25 times...
(speaks indistinctly)
I'm looking for a partnership.
I'm looking for somebody
that's gonna help
This business grow.
Well, see, but that--
You've identified
This is a great technology.
You're right. No, I get
that, Ben. I get that, right?
Yeah.
So part of your role
in coming into the shark tank is
being able to strategize,
and when you ask
for too much money...
what you need is us.
Absolutely.
Because you strategized
incorrectly, I'm out.
Ben, when I hear
a valuation like this,
I get a little insulted.
Why would I ever give you money
at a value that guarantees
I'll never get a return?
Here's the thing.
It's a $54 billion industry.
The biggest players--
Every guy comes in here
and says that.
Ben, my reaction is--
is This is too monochromatic.
You can't read it.
It takes too much sweat
to actually get the big bonus
of reading something
on your chest, so I'm out
because the product is
terrible, I think, honestly.
You know, Ben, I'm not sold
on the product.
Uh, I do think
it's a little bit gimmicky.
I'm out.
I appreciate your time.
Thank you very much.
I asked for too much money,
and I'm paying the price now,
but I think
they were shortsighted,
'cause this technology is
revolutionary.
