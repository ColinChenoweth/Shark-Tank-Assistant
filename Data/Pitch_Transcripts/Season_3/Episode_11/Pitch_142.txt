My name is Brenda Coffman,
and I'm from kokomo, indiana.
(whirs)
I own and operate
retail cookie stores
throughout the state of indiana
and Florida.
I am a hometown girl,
and I married
my high school sweetheart,
and we have
two wonderful children
who are the pride and joy
of our life.
During college,
to make ends meet,
I started baking
and selling cookies
on Friday and saturday nights.
(chuckles)
How many minutes are
on that timer?
Everyone loved the cookies,
and so I thought,
what a great time to start
a cookie business.
(Brenda) Hi.
Welcome to blondie's cookies.
How are you folks today?
(Brenda) I want to come
to the shark tank
because I want their help
to grow this company
into a household name.
I want everyone to know
blondie's cookies.
My name is Brenda Coffman,
but please call me blondie.
I'm the proud founder
and operator
of blondie's cookies inc.,
where we handcraft
over 25 varieties
of the best cookies and brownies
you'll ever taste.
I'm here seeking $200,000
for a 3% equity
in blondie's cookies inc.
3%?
3%.
(daymond and Barbara laugh)
I began baking--
I began baking when I was
just 15 years old.
My family Encouraged my baking,
and I quickly figured out
I was pretty good at it.
(Brenda) You'll be sampling
our top five Sellers tonight,
starting with
our famous Sprinkle cookie.
It's a vanilla shortbread with
our signature buttercream icing.
Then we have
our cocoa swirl cookie,
which is
a dark chocolate shortbread
and a ganache frosting.
Chocolate Chip is next,
white chocolate macadamia...
ohh.
And last But not least,
our macadamia chewy bar. Wow.
Very sweet.
Wow.
That is fantastic.
When was the last time
you had something
that tasted that good
for under $2?
Blondie?
Yes.
Uh, I can't help
but ask...
(laughs)
$200,000...
yes.
For 3%.
Yes.
That means you're valuing
these cookies
for over $5 million.
Our sales--
Over $6 million.
Our sales last year alone,
guys, were $2.3 million.
Our sales are scheduled
at $2.5 million for 2011.
How much money did you make?
Uh, last year was
a flat year.
We opened four stores in Florida
all in the same time period,
and, um,
with that investment,
we--we didn't have
a profitable year yet.
Why so many at once?
It seems very, very aggressive.
Yes,
in different territories.
Well, that's a very--
That's a very good question,
but when we knew
we were expanding that far,
for logistics purposes alone
and for branding purposes,
we knew we had to have
more than one location.
Help me understand.
You have the eight in indiana,
and then you move
to Florida.
Florida--a positive now,
or is it still a drag?
And what your plans are
for those units.
Well, two of the stores
in Florida
are still not a year old,
and I think
what we underestimated
as a business was that
we didn't realize how popular
we were in indiana.
We didn't realize how good
we were.
That's a nice spin there,
blondie.
Thank you.
(laughs)
Blondie, do you have
any other investors?
All right, so you're saying
the Florida stores are
losing a lot of money?
They are losing a lot of money
their first year, yes.
(Brenda and Barbara laugh)
These cookies are good.
Thank you.
Where your business is
right now, you went for it,
and it hasn't quite turned out
the way you planned,
but that's created
a significant problem
for an investor,
because my only hope
of getting my money back is
completely dependent
on what happens in Florida.
Right.
You are all-in, right?
Well, how many businesses
expand 45% in one year?
Well, look, what happened is
what happened, right,
but you're asking me
to put good money
to help support
what you already are--
Is telling us
is bad money...
right.
And that's the problem.
Well, the numbers
we talked about--
blondie, I'm out.
Barbara? Daymond?
I tasted the cookies.
Blown away.
Thank you.
I'm--I'm obsessed
with them already.
Thank you.
Then I started becoming
mesmerized by you.
I believe you're the brand.
But 3% for $200,000,
and you're valuing
the business at $7 million--
No, not--More than that
with debt.
$9 million, I think,
she's--
More than that with debt,
So, okay, $9 million.
I'm out.
Okay. I appreciate it.
Thank you.
I'm just gonna tell you
what I really think,
which is a hard thing
to do...
Sure.
Because you're like
a little bubbly Angel here.
That's okay.
I feel like, uh,
you've made a <i>big </i>mistake
in opening the Florida stores,
and I think on some level,
you know it,
but what's gonna work
against you,
'cause I know--I have
a good share of that in myself--
Is your refusal to quit.
That, plus your honor.
I could tell right away,
you're the type of person,
you commit to something,
you--You mean it.
Sure. Our balance sheet's
not looking good
because we pay our bills.
No.
We don't bow out.
And you'll pay your bills
until you die
on your own sword.
That's right.
I'm out.
Okay. Appreciate that.
By the way, I'm gonna eat
All those cookies, so... sorry.
(chuckles)
They're all for you guys.
I'm a customer.
Thank you.
Thanks, blondie. Good luck.
Thank you.
I'm a little disappointed,
but I've never given up
in 26 years,
and I'm not giving up now.
We have the best product.
It's all about the cookie
at blondie's.
