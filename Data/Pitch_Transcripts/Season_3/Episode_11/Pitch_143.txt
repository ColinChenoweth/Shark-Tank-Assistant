With a lot of support
from my husband mark
and my wonderful mom Betty,
my passion grew,
and so did our new
small little cookie business.
I wanted to be
the next mrs. Fields.
Today blondie's cookies
owns and operates
12 retail locations
in indiana and Florida.
Oh, but wait, sharks.
Be patient.
The feeding frenzy is about
to begin. (chuckles)
(chuckles)
Thank you, blondie.
You're welcome. Enjoy.
You're like a--You're like
a cartoon figure.
Enjoy.
Oh. (chuckles)
Really.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
(daymond) Thank you.
Thank you, Ms. Blondie.
(mark and Kevin) How much?
Um, hmm. Uh, let's see.
Probably about $175,000.
So that was a mistake,
wasn't it, going to Florida?
I don't think it's a mistake.
I'm not a quitter. I'm not.
That's not the point.
Sometimes--
Right.
Well...
you don't want to put
good money after bad.
I still think the markets are
wide open there, though.
We just haven't--
What makes you say that?
I mean, you know--
Well, because we haven't--
in--we haven't captured
the corporate clients
in Florida like we have
in indiana.
And do you have any--
Do you have any bank loans?
Sure we do.
How much debt do you have?
Um, about $800,000.
(men) Ohh.
Blondie.
Number two, there is nothing
on the market that tastes
like blondie's cookies,
absolutely nothing.
Number 3,
we have systems of 26 years.
I didn't start doing this
yesterday.
I have been doing it for
26 years in the mid--Midwest,
which is
an extremely tough market.
And fourth, you have me,
one of the hardest-Working
c.E.O.S I know.
I'm out.
Okay. I understand.
Blondie, I think you've done
a phenomenal job
of creating a brand.
I think you gotta--
You gotta pull in the horses
and focus on the core,
uh, not the remote locations.
I'm out.
Mrs. Fields grow--Grew
to millions and millions
of dollars
before they were purchased
by a larger company.
We have the best product
on the market,
and we know
what we're doing.
We're
a proven turnkey operation.
I'm not asking you to come in
and run my business.
I know how to do cookies,
but you know business,
and you know how
to go to those next levels,
and you know how to
get past those plateaus.
You know, blondie...
(sighs) I don't like you.
(laughs)
Because of you,
I'm gonna be in the gym
for about three hours
tonight.
The market is crying out for
something new, and we have it.
We just need your relationships
and capital to help drive sales.
What are the sales?
This year we've done
$140,000,
80% of which has been done
in the last 3 months.
Can I see one?
Sure. How about this one?
So you can see it
and appreciate it.
And is this your technology
you invented,
or did you license it?
No. This is my technology.
I invented it,
and it's patent pending
right now.
How did you invent it?
My background's
in chemistry.
I was in medical school,
and I was working out...
(Robert chuckles)
And I saw sweat patterns
on my shirt.
(chuckles) I thought it would
be kind of a novel idea
to create messaging
out of it,
so I did
significant research,
and I dropped out
of medical school
to pursue this.
Did you quit
medical school?
I did.
You're doing this
full-Time?
Full-time.
So...
it's an interesting idea.
I'm just trying
to get my mind around
whether that would cause me
to buy the shirt.
It's not the shirt.
It's the technology.
Think of it as a new medium
for branding and messaging.
So is your strategy
to license the technology
to players
in the apparel business?
Uh, to license the technology
not only to apparel players,
but we can integrate
the technology
into other textiles.
So the $140,000 you've sold,
has that been licensing?
No, what we've done is, we have
full decoration services that--
We take
other people's shirts,
like high school teams,
college teams,
we put this chemical
on the shirt.
It's subsequently applied
to the shirt,
and then the shirt's ready
to go to be sold.
All right, but nike has
a 4% market share...
You're a long line of guys...
if we had one--
That have made
this strategic mistake.
I'm very frustrated
'cause I like the idea,
but then I see stupidity.
I really do.
I see somebody's who's arrogant
and insulted me financially,
which I take
a lot of offense in.
I'm out.
Hi.
My name is mark Sullivan,
and I'm an inventor
with over 1,000 inventions,
and the technology
I'm offering you today
is the Sullivan generator.
For only $1 million,
I am offering
10% of my generator.
This is
an electric generator
which harnesses
the spin of the earth.
It works by taking
in salt water.
It processes the water
and leaves behind
the mineral precipitates.
The water vapor is then
delivered to a vortex chamber,
where the coriolis effect
spins this into a hurricane,
which drives the turbines,
which makes electricity.
The waste products are
the mineral precipitates
manganese and gold.
What?
Gold.
Gold?
Gold.
G-O-L-D?
G-O-L-D.
Let him finish.
We suck water in.
We make it spin
really fast...
right.
And we produce electricity
on one hand...
right.
And gold bars
on the other.
That's it.
The waste products can be
$96 billion in gold,
so we can have over 200
of these generators set up
all over the world.
They're, uh, controlled
over the internet.
With your help
and your business acumen,
together we can develop
this new technology
and leave a lasting legacy
of goodness.
Mark, how long are you
visiting earth?
(mark C., Barbara, and Robert
laugh)
What's your background, mark?
I have degrees
in biomedical engineering
and physics.
I've been working on This
for several years.
You're the first that
I have presented this to,
so you have
a great opportunity right now.
What's going on
in that little tank?
Well, this is just a model
to illustrate
the force of the conservation
of angular momentum.
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about
or what you said,
so with that, I'm out.
If your theory is correct,
would it not seem to make sense
that in real-Life hurricanes,
there would be sprinkles
of gold left somewhere?
That's right.
The gold is left
in the ocean.
So if I went to a hurricane area
in the ocean,
how much gold would I get out
of that salt water?
We process
1 cubic mile of salt water,
we're gonna get
1,500 tons of gold
as a waste product.
Yeah. Yeah,
but you've still got...
what?
To be able to process
a cubic mile of--
Of water--Of ocean water.
That's enormous.
How big is
the entire machine?
This is 100 feet tall.
So you're creating
a synthetic hurricane
and trapping it
in a 100-Foot-High tube.
That's right.
If I gave you
$1 million today,
how long would it take
to build the first one?
We would h--Be operational
in nine months.
No way.
Way.
My... Meter is going
through the roof.
It's going, "Bing, Bing, Bing,
Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing."
I'm out.
What about
the other 999 inventions?
Did you ever make any money
with those?
My inventions are making
over $1 billion per year.
Can you name one that
I would know?
Artificial hearts,
artificial kidney--
You invented
the artificial heart?
It's a left ventricular
assist device.
Do you get money
from that?
I do get some royalties,
and I get royalties
from my music.
I write music. I design,
uh, clothing. I sew.
(daymond, Robert,
and Kevin laugh)
I want to know what
you sew.
Leather,
and I sew ladies' skirts
and vests and handbags.
(laughs)
(laughs)
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
It's a very fine line...
go ahead.
Of being a genius and crazy.
Yeah.
I'm just asking you,
has anybody ever said
to you, "you're crazy"?
no, I've won
engineering awards.
I don't smoke.
I don't drink.
I'm thinking
maybe you should.
(laughs)
Mark, if I gave you
$50,000,
and Kevin gave you
the other $950,000...
(laughs)
How much gold would we make
from the $50,000 machine?
It would be determined
by the flow of water
processed through
the generator.
Mark, may I interrupt you?
That might be
the reason why--
May I interrupt him
just a minute?
Uh-huh. Yes, ma'am.
I'm out.
Look, mark, enough of this.
I made you a legitimate offer.
I'll give you the...
(laughs)
(chuckles)
I'll give you the $50,000
if you can get O'Leary to
give you the other $950,000,
'cause that man loves gold
more than any other human being
I've ever met.
Or I could just go buy
some gold
with my $950,000.
(laughs
and speaks indistinctly)
But that's not fun.
That's not fun.
Look, mark,
it's very interesting,
but most of it's
nutbar factor six.
I'm out.
Well, mark, you weren't able
to convince O'Leary,
and <i>only </i>for that reason,
I'm out, too.
I-I guess you just didn't
get it, you know,
but that can happen, and, uh,
this is the--the plight
of the inventor.
Good luck.
Okay. Bye-Bye.
This way, mark. This way.
Thank you.
(chuckles)
(mark c.) Oh, my God.
That guy was great.
Maybe we're just
too simple.
Maybe that was the best deal
in the tank this year.
I think so, man.
In America, this is the land
of opportunity and innovation,
and inventors like me are
what will save America.
(mark, Robert,
and Barbara laugh)
What was the offer
you walked away from last time?
Last time I was here...
it was my offer.
You offered $600,000 for 51%
of the I.P. And the patents.
And you know what?
I said it was a great deal.
It was even more
than I would have offered.
You screwed up.
You guys have
great memories.
in the marketplace
like I do.
I agree,
so what's it gonna take?
What are we gonna do here?
Give--Give me a chance
to explain the valuation, okay?
Most national brands,
which we are becoming,
sell for 2 1/2 to 3 times
the gross dollar value.
When you just sell a brand,
then it shifts over to--
but you're not there yet.
You're not there yet,
'cause you're--You're--
You're not there yet.
When will I be there?
Look--
after you've done--
One more year.
No, no.
But you're not.
Why not try for 30%, mark,
so we get 10% each?
I don't think he'll go for it,
but we can negotiate.
But try that.
(Jim) I think they're
not appreciating
you've got a proven technology,
a proven product.
You've proven
there's a market,
and when I started
Sam Adams,
everybody thought it was
a dumb idea,
and nobody would invest,
and I only got, like,
lowball offers,
and look where
Sam Adams is today.
Passion will take you
a long way.
Watch what he does
when he comes back.
He's gonna be
complicated again.
in trying to have a partner
as established as mark cuban,
that it would be valuable to me
to pay additionally,
above what I'm asking for
for an investment, of 3%,
so $300,000 for 8%
of the company.
That's your counter?
That's my counter.
Mark cuban's not interested
in that.
And tell me why, mark.
Because it's not enough skin
in the game.
Because you want
the value of the sharks
and what we bring
to the table,
and that's an effort...
Mm-hmm.
Right?
Just like you've created
a valuation...
Yeah.
We have our own valuations
of our time
and our effort as well,
and what I'm saying--
It's just not worth it.
What I suggested
and they agreed with was that
we need to get significant skin
in the game,
but it's worth putting in
more money to get it,
so what we suggested was
$600,000 for 30%,
because that's $200,000 apiece,
10% equity apiece,
three rock stars
to help support you
and build your brand,
and you still retain 70%,
so you get significant amounts
of leverage,
and you have the capital,
should you need it, to expand
into other product lines
to fund your growth.
Twice the money you came here
looking for.
I agree that having
more skin in the game
makes a lot more sense
for you guys. I agree that
that could be a greater value
and asset to my company.
Does it get us a deal
in the stadium next year,
in the Dallas mavericks?
It gets you first crack.
I can't make a promise
just because we have
a service organization
that I have to go through.
Uh-huh.
But when we were talking,
you know, I own
the landmark theatres,
and quite a few of them sell
alcohol and single-Serve wine,
and the bigger theatres serving
Alcohol makes perfect sense.
Yeah.
Why can't...
the--
You're talking yourself out
of a sale.
You need to make a decision.
James, mark and I will
keep Kevin in line. Don't worry.
You've convinced me
from the very get-Go
because you went
from $500,000 to $5 million,
and then $12 million next year.
You were right
about that concept.
You need to make a decision
right now
on what you want to do.
I wanna be partners
with you guys...
But if I trade my company
30% for $600,000
and basically give my company
at that kind of discount,
and I don't have
any kind of guarantee
that I-I can even get into,
uh, you know,
the single stadium
that you control,
then I'm in a position where
I'm trying to understand
what kind of value
that you might be adding.
Then you just have to decide.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
