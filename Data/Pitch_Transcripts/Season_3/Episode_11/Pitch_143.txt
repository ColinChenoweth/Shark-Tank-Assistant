James, you're still dead
to me.
(laughs)
Nice to see all of you.
My name's James Martin,
founder and c.E.O.
Of copa di vino.
I'm here today seeking
an investment of $300,000
for 5% of my company.
You may all recall
copa di vino,
"wine by the glass."
No corkscrews.
No extra glasses.
Just open and enjoy.
Last time I was here,
I told you
I would revolutionize
the wine world.
I had just launched
the concept,
but I had
had over $500,000 in sales
in the first six months.
Well, this year
I'm on track to sell
over $5 million in sales.
In truth, I cannot keep up
with demand.
I literally have
twice the amount of orders
than I can produce,
and to catch up,
I have to build
a second bottling line,
and that is
why I'm here today,
to give you
that elusive second bite
of the apple.
(chuckles)
We missed out on
a perfect opportunity last time.
Kevin,
last time I was here,
you told me
you were gonna drink
a $1,000 bottle of wine
While weeping over
the missed opportunity.
Agonize no more.
This time around,
we're gonna make a deal,
and to commemorate
the occasion,
I've bottled
a $1,000 bottle of wine
in my copa glass.
With your investment,
we'll drink these together,
and we'll toast to the millions
we'll continue to roll in.
I ask all of you,
please take a second look
at copa di vino
and become my partners.
Can you hear it?
That's opportunity
knocking again.
Last time, you were stuck
on the idea of taking
a now-Proven technology
and hoarding it
for just yourself,
when the real opportunity was
to give the entire wine industry
a license
of this exact technology
so that all wines could
be sold this way.
Instead of just making
$5 million,
you could make $500 million,
and I wept like a child,
drinking
a $2,000 bottle of wine,
realizing I was unable
to help you out of your madness
and your insanity.
Have you repented?
James, what are you drinking
to come back here?
You know we're not gonna be
as gentle and as tender
as we was last time
to you.
I don't remember gentle
when I was here last time.
(sharks laugh)
That <i>was </i>gentle.
Oh, that's good.
That's great.
I do remember Someone
standing here
and s--and professing
the value of the brand,
and now I see someone
standing in front of you
that's proven the value
of the brand...
James...
(speaks indistinctly)
And the value
of the patents that
you're really interested in
are now much more valuable.
Uh, look, look,
when I last saw you,
I said you were
a dead man walking
and you were dead to me.
Now are you a ghost
or are you real?
You know what? I bottled
a $1,000 bottle of wine
so you and I could go ahead
and put the past in the past.
In the decision
to bottle this,
I created a name for you
for this wine.
I call it...
(laughs)
the dead man walking.
(Robert and Barbara laugh)
This is for you, Buddy.
I like it, James,
but I want to ask you a question
that's gonna help set you free.
What if we could take
the technology
to the largest three players
in the wine industry
and license it to them?
You keep doing
what you're doing...
Mm-hmm.
'cause you love it.
You'll pay me a royalty,
of which you'll get 49%...
mm-hmm.
And I will <i>quadriple</i>
your net worth in two quarters
by simply taking this to people
that have distribution
50 TIMES larger than you,
and every time
they sell something,
you'll make money.
So we're right back...
why not just--
to the original offer.
Yep.
Of course it is,
'cause it's the right thing
to do.
If my memory serves me
correctly,
you passed out
some wine the last time.
Mm.
You know, try--
Try passing wine out
this easily
with any other brand.
There you go.
Thank you.
I'm waiting
for the good stuff.
Wait. Hold on a second.
Well, I wasn't interested
last time,
and I just want to be
thoroughly entertained
while you go back and forth
with these guys,
so I'm out,
but thanks for the wine.
You're welcome.
James, I don't want to do battle
with you anymore.
I want to figure out how
to do business with you,
'cause I want to drink
that good wine,
not the swill Barb is drinking.
(laughs)
I'd like to figure out,
how can I invest in the piece
that has the <i>real </i>value,
because wineries are
a labor of love,
and you are in love.
I hate that business.
I love the packaging business
you have.
You have
a <i>huge </i>global opportunity,
and I so much want to be
your partner in that.
Look, I have
a better understanding
than I did last time,
but I'm still not comfortable
that a $6 million valuation,
even with the m-Marginal value
of the intellectual property,
is worth the investment.
You need to start telling us
that you're negotiable
on the equity portion.
Very well said. I-I agree that
we are here to negotiate.
I think it's
really important for you
to take some of the information
that I have more seriously,
that I-I, at this point,
am an expert.
No one in--in the world today
knows wine by the glass
I just feel like...
James, you know...
(speaks indistinctly)
When you just came
in here again,
I was happy to see you
for some reason,
like, "ohh,"
like an old friend...
mm.
And he got
a new haircut...
(chuckles)
But as I'm listening
and listening,
I'm having the same
visceral reaction to you.
For some reason,
and I hope you take it well,
I didn't like you then,
and I don't like you now...
But take it well.
But I don't where
that's coming from.
I just have to say
I'm out.
I'm not arguing that
you see it at $6 million,
but you have to see that
we see it at something less.
Potentially there's
somewhere in the middle
that we can meet,
but we're asking you
to start to move the needle
and start to move the valuation
so that we can respond.
Normally we don't do that.
Normally we say, "you know what?
We're just gonna tell you,"
but you know
what you're doing.
You're very aware
of your industry.
You're very aware of
the components of your business,
so we're asking you.
It sounds like you guys have
an interest in this, right?
If we can work on a valuation,
we may be able to make
a deal here, correct?
Which, uh,
I've been saying for...
a long time.
Too many times.
(chuckles) Yeah.
You've tortured me so long,
I'm gonna put an offer
out anyways.
I'll do the $300,000 for 12%,
'cause that's exactly
what you're worth right now.
So you're saying the company's
worth $2 1/2 million today?
That's exactly
what it's worth.
You have something of tremendous
potential here globally.
At some point, I know
I'll be able to convince you
to set it free,
and you'll make so much money,
you can kick back
on the copa hillside and say,
"Kevin O'Leary was right.
I'm so <i>lucky </i>to have him
as a partner."
That's what's gonna happen,
and my ticket
to entry is $300,000.
All right.
You beat me into a pulp.
Give me the good stuff.
I can't take this anymore.
Wow.
Before you make
a decision...
James, who did you call?
I called Jim Koch.
He's the founder
of Samuel Adams.
He basically the--the father
of craft brewing in America,
and Jim's been instrumental
in--in bringing my company
to this level.
What did he say to you?
Jim basically wanted
to make sure that,
whoever I'm becoming,
uh, a partner with,
that they share in the dream,
they understand the vision,
and they understand
the possibilities.
Is he an, uh,
an investor in the company
or an EQUITY owner
in the company?
Jim's an advisor.
An advisor. He doesn't have
any equity at all?
No equity.
Then why didn't he just
give you the money
for your extra line
that you need?
The best advice is gonna come
from someone who's not vested
in your company.
You know,
I really respect Koch.
He's a legend
in the beverage industry.
No question. But he's not
spending his money right here.
So what did he tell you to do
with the $300,000 for 12%
that Kevin offered you?
You know, uh, basically,
it's--It's half the price
of what the value
of--Of my company is,
and he--He recommended that,
if I'm interested
Don't do this again, James.
James, you've done something
nobody in the tank
has ever done.
You've been given
the American dream to come back.
Who's--Who's in on this?
It's you, you, and you?
Yes, sir.
All three.
(sighs)
Kevin, if I get that phone call
from you all the time that says,
"We've gotta
split this company up..."
No.
James, you wouldn't have
come back here
if you didn't see value
in the tank in us.
So don't ask us to start
selling ourselves
back to you now.
You're the one that came back.
We're not--We didn't go see you.
No more talking.
We made a very fair offer
to you.
You've gotta make a decision.
It's a $1 million
bottle of wine.
(laughs) Yeah.
30% of the company.
That should go
for $1.2 million,
and I'm gonna sell it
for...
$600,000.
I don't think you're
thinking clearly on that.
Well, hang on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kevin, I think he's saying yes.
What are you saying?
James, let me drink
one of those with you...
Kevin. Kevin.
In celebration of the deal.
(Robert) James,
what are you saying?
(sets down cup)
I'm out.
You know what? I'm out.
You screwed around.
You're playing games,
and there's nothing I hate more
than playing games.
(slapping hand)
You knew the number. You knew
the number when you walked out,
you knew the number
when you walked in,
and you came in
and created drama.
That makes--
No.
I came looking
to make partners with you
at a very reasonable valuation
that was done by experts,
not by someone that says, "well,
I see what the wine industry is.
My friends Have wineries."
These are the top experts
in the country
who have told me
what my company's worth.
But none of them
gave you any money.
You know as well as we do
that it's worth what
someone will pay for it.
I'm just telling you, James,
I'm out.
Robert, Kevin,
you guys gonna split it?
Yeah, well,
you know, James, I...
I'm--I'm really out.
(laughs)
I mean, you just came here
to waste our time.
(Robert) So...
cheers.
(exhales deeply)
I'm sorry, but I think
I've earned this.
(sharks laughing)
I came here in good faith,
really wishing for these sharks
to become my partners.
No one could share
in that vision.
It was all about the money
and whether they could
get a discount
on the value of my company.
I won't be back.
