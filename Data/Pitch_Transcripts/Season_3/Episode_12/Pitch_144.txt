(mark chuckles) Dang.
(laughs)
(mark laughs) Yeah.
I don't know. This sounds
like a personal thing.
But he's not gonna get it
on air immediately...
(laughs)
has been remarkable.
So the $540,000 is to do
a little bit more
of what we're doing already.
Not even a murse guy?
(Robert) What's a murse, mark?
A man purse. Murse.
Um... (chuckles)
Wow.
(Lori laughs)
I like the fact
that you're selling
in jewelry stores, right?
You go where they ain't.
I think that's brilliant.
But at the same time,
I just don't think
that I can add the value
that you would need.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Um, so...
what did mark call it?
A man purse?
Thank you.
(mark) Thanks, guys. Good luck.
(Lori) Good luck.
Actually, the patent wasn't
even to sell.
The patent didn't cover
anything.
No.
There's a lot of great product
out there,
We feature the only tank top
on the market
with interchangeable
removable straps.
We are seeking
a $57,000 investment...
(chuckles)
for a 30% stake in our company.
(mouths word)
We are
two pittsburgh hockey moms...
There ya go. Go, pens!
Who came up
with this concept
at our sons' 6:00 a.M.
Hockey practice.
Each trimi tank comes with
three sets of straps
that you get to choose.
did you do
any market research,
ask people what
they thought of it?
Yes.
We have done a craft show,
a huge--Well, not a huge--
But a flea market in pittsburgh.
Small venues that we could
just get into.
Small markets.
How many women
at that flea market...
you guys are, like,
the best friends.
had them on--Online.
Because we were
at a flea market.
It was...
they were buying fruit
that day.
When you're saying that you were
at a flea market,
You know what?
Just a minute, mark.
You can target specific groups.
Right.
I mean, we could go
into a sorority
You know what? I saw it
in flea markets as well.
You haven't--you haven't
proved the market yet.
It's there, though.
It really, really is.
It really is there.
Good pitch, great energy,
but I'm out.
Hi, my name is Mark Lim,
this is my beautiful wife Hanna,
I must've tried every
toddler straw cup on the market
only to find that most of them
had spill-Proof valves,
like these, that made them
incredibly hard
for her to drink from.
Cleaning them was
even more frustrating.
so we designed lollacup to
eliminate all the challenges.
You don't know how many times
my daughter has done this
with her straws
(mark) What didn't they like?
(Robert) What's wrong
with the packaging?
Yeah,
what didn't they like?
They didn't--
I think it took
too much real estate,
(mark l.) Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, I love the colors.
The two of you together
or...
um, you know, I mean, I'm the
mom who uses it the most.
So I came with the concept,
but we did work on it together.
(Robert) Thank you.
(Lori) I love your dedication,
(mark) Where are you guys
selling these now?
Which stores?
What kind of stores?
Mostly baby stores,
kids clothing stores...
baby stores.
It's really not my market,
I mean, there's no limitations.
There--We--We still go sell.
Here's what I learned about
the baby niche market like this.
To make any real money,
you've gotta go
to general distribution,
like every other product.
What's your thought on that?
I think our sales strategy
really--
which we've seen in products
that we end up buying
at target--
(mark l.) okay.
It is really about
this--This agent.
Mark, what are you doing here?
Trying to figure out
what I'm gonna do.
You know, not all deals
are easy.
You know, guys, the sales agency
thing is problematic,
but it's the past.
It's happened.
You gotta let that run out.
In--In eight short months.
In eight short months.
(laughs) In eight sh--Now when
you write a check for $100,000,
there's no such thing
as eight short months. Yeah.
(Lori) Yeah.
Mark, you know that
the value is wrong.
You know the value's wrong.
Why don't you throw
another number back at me?
I mean, these offers are
ridiculous. You know that.
Right.
But why don't you throw
a number back at me?
These offers are not ridiculous.
'cause they're real offers.
No real offer's ridiculous.
You know that.
(exhales deeply)
okay. Um...
would you be willing to do
$100,000 for 40%?
Yes. Done.
(chuckles)
Shake on it?
(Lori laughs)
Do we have a deal?
Well, I, you know,
I have to respect...
'cause we're--He just
asked me a question...
(Kevin) Not so fast.
So I to respect... (laughs)
(Hanna laughs)
Sit down.
(daymond) Sit down!
Get back on the bench!
Just one shot. One shot.
(mark c.) if I walk back here...
This is--This is
a-a one-Shot deal?
One-Shot deal.
(daymond) Can I--
can we get two seconds
to talk to my wife?
You can talk all you want,
but if I walk back there...
right.
24 seconds. Okay.
(Robert) Mark,
do you really--Really--
How rude is that?
Right.
I mean.... mark...
right.
15 seconds left.
I'll do the same deal--30%.
(Lori) Oh, you've got
all these offers.
(Kevin) Whoa!
Well, hang on.
What happened there?
I just said I'll do
the same deal for 30%.
Hey, wait a second.
I just beat mark's deal.
Right.
Mark, would you be willing
to work with Robert?
Because, really, we would really
like your expertise.
(daymond) guys, I gave you
a great offer.
Hey! I gave you a great offer,
but you took too long,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
Mark, would you be willing
to go in with Robert?
Because we would love to have
both of your expertise.
I thought when you sat down,
it was over.
Sometimes I reconsider.
Um, for 40%?
Yes.
Robert,
are you cool with that?
Hanna, you could've hugged me,
you didn't have to hug mark.
(laughs)
I-I have exclusivity here.
You know... (laughs)
(sharks laughing)
Oh, they're great.
They're a great couple.
I mean, right at this moment,
I--We're on cloud nine.
But I think it's just motivation
to work even Harder.
Right.
