My name is Barbara lampugnale,
and I live
in west Hartford, connecticut.
I am a mother of six girls,
two of which have gone off
to college.
(chuckles)
My girls and I absolutely love
doing Fun things together,
so on Sunday nights,
it's become tradition that
we all get together
and paint each other's nails.
It was on one
of these nail nights
where my idea just hit me.
Wow.
With the economy being
the way that it is,
it's been really tough.
We've had such struggles,
coming very close
to losing our house.
I've gone so far as to, um...
(chuckles)
Sell my engagement ring,
and we've just invested
what we could
into this business.
We have come to a point
where we're at the end
of our resources,
and an investment
from the sharks
will truly change the lives
of my family.
My name is
Barbara lampugnale,
and I'm the owner
of duality cosmetics.
I am so excited to share
with you today
my revolutionary, new product,
the nail Pak.
I am asking for $50,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.
I am a mother
of six daughters.
Traditionally,
on Sunday nights in our house,
it's what we call
"Nail night."
It's where my daughters
and I all gather
and we paint
each other's nails.
On one of these nights, I took
a common nail polish bottle,
put it on top
of a small plastic container,
and the inspiration hit me.
This... was too much stuff.
The nail polish, the pads,
the remover, and the files--
All...
(clatters)
Too much stuff,
So, voila, the idea
for the nail Pak was born.
I thought, what could be
more convenient and simple
than putting
all four of those things--
The nail polish, the pads,
the remover, and the file--
In one easy-to-Use container?
The nail Pak has 0.8 ounces
of nail polish on the top.
When you remove it
from the bottom,
it has a nail file.
When you pull this tab,
you will find cotton pads
that are pre-Moistened
with nail polish remover.
With the nail Pak,
we can make changing
your manicure
as easy as changing
your mind.
What about the pricing
on this?
Tell me what it costs
to make one bottle
and how much
you sell it for.
Right now, because I'm only
doing a run of 10,000,
it's just a little over $3.
$3.
And what do you sell it for?
$14.99.
Ooh. I like those margins.
So would the average woman
think that's expensive,
the $14.99?
I don't believe so,
not in, um, some
of the cosmetic-Type stores.
It's right on par,
but you're also getting
a 3-in-1 value.
Right. C-Could I see it?
Yeah, can I see it, too?
Oh, absolutely.
I'm so sorry.
When did you apply
for your patent?
Approximately
nine months ago.
Did you check to see
if anybody else has made
anything else like this?
Absolutely. The--the money that
I've paid my patent attorney,
he'd better have done all
of that and more. (chuckles)
And--and there was
nothing out there like this
that he could find?
Absolutely nothing.
How much do you have
invested, Barbara?
Personally,
we've invested about--
Just under $300,000.
(Kevin and daymond) WHOA!
Yeah. That's--That's
a lot of cash, Barbara.
What do you do for a living?
I'm a stay-at-Home mom
currently. (laughs)
And you just saved it
all up over time?
It--
Well, my husband is
a real estate developer,
so for quite a long time,
we were doing very well.
And actually
that's why I'm here now,
because the last
couple years,
it's been extremely challenging
for our family.
Barbara, do you have any channel
in distribution or retail
that's agreed to take it on
or give you an order?
I have really just started
talking to them
within the last month,
'cause I find with the products
that you can explain it
and it sounds like
a really great idea,
but until you actually
see it, feel it, touch it,
it makes--
It has such a wow factor
to it.
So your premise of demand
is based on
your own family experience,
your six daughters and yourself
on Nail night sundays.
Are those all
your own daughters?
The--Every single one
of 'em.
Well, you look terrific.
Thank you. Good genes.
(laughs)
(Robert laughs)
(laughs) What--what--
are you gonna date her
or invest in her?
I'm just--I'm just saying...
Yeah, right.
But--But I want--
I don't think
my italian Husband would
like that very much.
(Robert) Yeah.
(Lori) Dream on. Come on.
Yeah.
(Kevin) the premise
of this brand is not necessarily
the quality
of the nail polish itself.
It's the convenience factor
that you're providing
by putting the pads
underneath the bottle.
I'm not saying it's bad.
Mm-hmm.
I'm just wondering,
where's the proof?
You know, I'm
a skeptical investor, Barbara.
I see.
I want to know that
it's gonna work,
not just
because your six daughters
and yourself had a great time
on a Sunday night with it.
Right.
Now if this doesn't work,
you've blown $300,000, right?
But I don't look
at it negatively like that.
No, no.
Barbara, I can't add
any value with this.
I mean, the--the thought
of spending $300,000
before you have orders...
Mm-Hmm.
Wow, you gotta have
some, uh, guts to do that.
This isn't an investment
for me. I'm out.
Barbara,
the challenge I have
is that right now
it's just you, right,
and so you're gonna need
a big support team
in order to get it
where you need to go.
I'm not the guy
to help you build
that infrastructure
and support team
to go out
and sell this product,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
It's great that
you got to this point,
but I don't know
if it sells.
You know what I need?
I want some distribution.
What are you gonna do
with this, Lori?
What am <i>I </i>gonna do with it?
Yeah.
(laughs) What are you gonna
do with it, Kevin?
No, but if you told me
you were gonna put it on qvc,
I might get interested
in funding some of it.
That's my point.
It needs distribution.
Well, here's the thing.
If I'm gonna put it in on qvc,
I'm not gonna need your help.
Well, maybe you do...
exactly.
Because you have
the same risk I have.
Why?
Well, look, you may be
a greedy Savage,
but you may make
a big mistake.
(chuckles)
I'm not worried about it.
I'm not worried about what--
you tell him, Lori.
If I decide to go in on this,
I can do it myself.
Well, then what are
you doing?
Because maybe
what I'll do is--
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Then I may have to bid you up.
I'll make you pay more.
I'm telling you...
I'm not afraid.
Don't mess
with Mr. Wonderful.
I-I'm not--
Barbara, I r--I rarely--
No, no. Let me jump in.
I rarely say this,
but sometimes it's better
to own 49% of something
that's selling
than 100% of a pure idea.
Exactly.
(Kevin) he's not writing you
a check.
It's very interesting advice.
It's exactly worth that--
Nothing.
Very interesting moment for you.
What are you gonna do?
so the decision you have
to make, Barbara, is,
should you give up control
of your baby?
51%.
(chuckles)
I love that. "Baby."
That means the decisions
are no longer one
that you make alone, okay?
Right.
I don't need to have control
in this situation,
because I totally trust
your decision-Making.
You've got it here.
I'm a financial investor.
You need money.
Now what I'm prepared to do is
give you the same offer for 40%.
Then I'll call
the shopping channels with you.
Done that before, so lots--
and they'll hang up
when they hear him.
Well, maybe this one will,
or maybe another buyer will
understand the opportunity,
and we'll go to them.
I've sold lots of stuff
on shopping channels
in my career,
all kinds of products,
from children's software...
and it works.
I know how to do it.
Now, daymond,
you've got retail.
You wanna come in with me
on this?
(Lori scoffs)
I've been in the shopping world,
shopping channel world,
for 15 years.
You talk like it's nothing.
Most people fail that
go on, but--
not me. I don't fail.
Yeah, you will fail.
But, see, we don't--
We don't--We don't fail--
You know nothing about
nail polish.
Wait a minute.
I'm not gonna sell it.
Wait, Wait, Wait,
wait, wait.
I've been on for 15 years.
I'm not gonna sell it.
Barbara's gonna sell it.
You can't just call up
a buyer and say, "hey..."
No.
We just take the 10,000 units,
put it into duty-Free,
and then license the rest
to avon,
and we won't need
a shopping channel,
so--
And they talk like it's so easy,
and you know it's not.
Yeah, that's 'cause we've
done it before.
We've done it before.
I'm sorry. We've done it.
You--You know what?
We've done it before.
Sorry. You have not.
I know all about qvc...
we've done it before.
And I know the success rate.
All right.
Big deal.
I've been doing retail
for 25 years...
you don't know how to sell
on tv, daymond.
And branding.
I've forgotten more
than she has learned.
I'm not worried about that.
That is not--
Oh, come on.
I couldn't care less
about that.
If you want to deal
with financial guys...
the issue is that--
the issue is that--
That smoke cigarettes
Negotiate, Barbara.
Well, the--the 51%...
You've got the leverage.
Does scare me.
I'm just...
(speaks indistinctly)
And you should be scared.
What do you offer back
to me, Barbara?
I like the 40%.
I like--I like you.
You want 40%?
You seem like a lovely lady,
and I like the idea
of the big party
and all of us girls.
Wow.
All right.
I'll give you $50,000. 40%.
Don't do it, Barbara.
Done. You have to ignore them.
They don't exist anymore.
You don't have to do
anything.
Right now. Say yes, and it'll be
on qvc within months.
Yes.
Done. Good job, Lori.
Wow. Bang!
Oh, she got <i>you, </i>O'Leary.
(Kevin) No, she didn't.
She got you.
She had to come down
to my price.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(speaks indistinctly)
I hope so.
I promise you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
I'm so excited.
(Robert) Yeah, she--
Congratulations, Barbara.
Congrats.
Thank you, everybody.
Way to go, Lori.
Good job, Lori.
Whoo! Oh, yeah.
Well, I want you all
to know,
I think that product's gonna
be <i>huge. </i>(chuckles)
why hasn't somebody
done this?
Like that.
Everybody says, "Oh, this is
the greatest idea in the world.
Why didn't I think of that?"
because they didn't.
Because she did.
Daymond And Barbara ended up
joining forces with Kevin
and connected us
to jamba juice.
And jamba juice liked
our business so much,
they ended up buying
the entire company.
