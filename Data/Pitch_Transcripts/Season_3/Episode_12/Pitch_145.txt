My name is Barbara lampugnale,
My name is
Barbara lampugnale,
How much do you have
invested, Barbara?
Personally,
we've invested about--
Just under $300,000.
Yeah. That's--That's
a lot of cash, Barbara.
What do you do for a living?
I'm a stay-at-Home mom
currently. (laughs)
Barbara, do you have any channel
in distribution or retail
that's agreed to take it on
or give you an order?
I have really just started
talking to them
within the last month,
'cause I find with the products
that you can explain it
You know, I'm
a skeptical investor, Barbara.
I see.
I want to know that
it's gonna work,
not just
because your six daughters
Barbara, I can't add
any value with this.
I mean, the--the thought
of spending $300,000
before you have orders...
Mm-Hmm.
Wow, you gotta have
some, uh, guts to do that.
This isn't an investment
for me. I'm out.
Barbara,
the challenge I have
is that right now
it's just you, right,
Barbara, I r--I rarely--
No, no. Let me jump in.
I rarely say this,
but sometimes it's better
to own 49% of something
that's selling
than 100% of a pure idea.
Exactly.
(Kevin) he's not writing you
a check.
It's very interesting advice.
It's exactly worth that--
Nothing.
Very interesting moment for you.
What are you gonna do?
so the decision you have
to make, Barbara, is,
should you give up control
of your baby?
51%.
(chuckles)
I love that. "Baby."
That means the decisions
are no longer one
that you make alone, okay?
Right.
I don't need to have control
in this situation,
because I totally trust
your decision-Making.
You've got it here.
I'm a financial investor.
You need money.
Now what I'm prepared to do is
give you the same offer for 40%.
Then I'll call
the shopping channels with you.
I've been on for 15 years.
I'm not gonna sell it.
Barbara's gonna sell it.
Negotiate, Barbara.
Well, the--the 51%...
You've got the leverage.
Does scare me.
What do you offer back
to me, Barbara?
I like the 40%.
I like--I like you.
You want 40%?
Don't do it, Barbara.
Done. You have to ignore them.
They don't exist anymore.
You don't have to do
anything.
Congratulations, Barbara.
Congrats.
Thank you, everybody.
Way to go, Lori.
Good job, Lori.
Whoo! Oh, yeah.
Well, I want you all
to know,
I think that product's gonna
be <i>huge. </i>(chuckles)
why hasn't somebody
done this?
Like that.
Everybody says, "Oh, this is
the greatest idea in the world.
Why didn't I think of that?"
because they didn't.
Because she did.
