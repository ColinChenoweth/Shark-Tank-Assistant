(mark chuckles) Dang.
And do you have
any outside investors?
Not yet.
$300,000?
It's just me. Yes.
(Robert) Wow.
It's the manufacturing.
I'm sure Lori could attest
to that.
I'm not trying to be negative.
(mark) And you shouldn't.
And you know what?
You shouldn't, right?
Right.
(mark)
he's all talk and no bite.
I'm not worried.
You--You just sit back
and watch me make me money.
Let's see.
There you go.
Let's see what happens.
Okay.
All right, so I like this.
Thank you.
I can do millions
of this for you
on qvc and everywhere else.
So here's my offer.
I'm gonna give you the $50,000,
and I want 51%
in the company...
(scoffs)
Wow.
Because I'm gonna take this,
and tomorrow morning,
you and I are gonna get
on the phone
and we're gonna strategize
what we're gonna do immediately
with the 10,000 units that
you already have sitting there.
I will get that on my show.
We will launch it.
We will be a huge success,
and I give you one condition.
You ready?
Okay.
The one condition is
that the night that I launch it,
you get your entire family,
all those six daughters
of yours, together,
you throw a huge party...
(chuckles)
And you hoot and Holler
and drink a huge glass
of Champagne
when you see
that "Sold out" sign
come up on air.
All right.
I have an offer for you.
That would work.
I'll give you
the $50,000 for 40%.
Then I'll just call her.
(laughs)
(mark laughs) Yeah.
I don't know. This sounds
like a personal thing.
But he's not gonna get it
on air immediately...
(laughs)
I'll just go
to their competitor.
And he doesn't have
the following,
the millions of viewers.
I'll just go to--
I'll just go
to their competitor.
There's another one that
does this, too.
and drink scotch and talk
about the markets--
You know what, honestly?
(daymond)
Uh, listen, listen, listen.
(laughs)
a piggy bank
with two Nickels in it
makes way more noise
than a full piggy bank,
and I have a <i>lot... </i>
(laughing)
Oh, my god.
Of knowledge.
That's a great one.
My piggy Bank is as full
as his piggy bank.
That was nasty.
You want to do the deal
at 40%?
(sighs)
has been remarkable.
So the $540,000 is to do
a little bit more
of what we're doing already.
Not even a murse guy?
(Robert) What's a murse, mark?
A man purse. Murse.
Um... (chuckles)
Wow.
(Lori laughs)
I like the fact
that you're selling
in jewelry stores, right?
You go where they ain't.
I think that's brilliant.
But at the same time,
I just don't think
that I can add the value
that you would need.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Um, so...
what did mark call it?
A man purse?
Thank you.
(mark) Thanks, guys. Good luck.
(Lori) Good luck.
Actually, the patent wasn't
even to sell.
The patent didn't cover
anything.
No.
There's a lot of great product
out there,
and these aren't unique.
That's the bottom line.
Lori was very interested
in our patent.
I hope that doesn't mean
she's gonna go home
and knock us off now.
She couldn't.
She sells bags for $20.
Whoa.
We feature the only tank top
on the market
with interchangeable
removable straps.
We are seeking
a $57,000 investment...
(chuckles)
for a 30% stake in our company.
(mouths word)
We are
two pittsburgh hockey moms...
There ya go. Go, pens!
Who came up
with this concept
at our sons' 6:00 a.M.
Hockey practice.
Each trimi tank comes with
three sets of straps
that you get to choose.
You can choose to layer them
or mix and match them
or simply just wear
one at a time.
The straps are super easy
to come on and off.
And they come in so many
different varieties.
There's jewelry straps,
ribbon straps,
funky straps,
any kind of...
and you're good to go.
Any strap you could imagine.
Currently, we are handmaking
each strap
and selling the tanks
in our homes.
Can I see the--
the, um, the tops, please?
Sure.
Absolutely.
In the future, we're hoping
that these straps
could then be interchanged
throughout a whole wardrobe.
Thank you.
So they could go from
your shirt to your dress,
did you do
any market research,
ask people what
they thought of it?
Yes.
We have done a craft show,
a huge--Well, not a huge--
But a flea market in pittsburgh.
And have gone to other, like,
handmade markets.
Small venues that we could
just get into.
Small markets.
And how did women react
to this?
Do you know what they say?
They say,
"that is the coolest idea.
Why didn't I think of that?"
and they always say, "you should
be on that 'shark tank' show."
(laughs)
And did they buy it?
They--That's exactly what
they said.
Did they buy it?
At the time, we had no means
of accepting credit cards,
and...
and we were in the wrong spot.
How many women
at that flea market...
you guys are, like,
the best friends.
had them on--Online.
Because we were
at a flea market.
It was...
they were buying fruit
that day.
When you're saying that you were
at a flea market,
and people really actually
didn't buy it.
They instead bought the fruit
or they instead bought
something else.
That's kind of a little bit
of a wake-Up call
that this might not be
your homerun.
I'm out.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.
Guys, since y'all are from
the 'burgh, right?
I love seeing Pittsburgh people
be entrepreneurs
and--And attack a business.
Um, we can go drink
some I.C. Light, have a--
You know what?
Just a minute, mark.
You can target specific groups.
Right.
I mean, we could go
into a sorority
and just have sorority letters
on them.
You can--We have
awareness ribbons.
You can go and do--
Look, I-I like the hustle.
I like the energy.
I like the vision, even.
But it's not an area where
I have a lot of expertise.
I couldn't tell you one good
tank top from another.
And as much as I wanna see
you guys become successful,
I just can't help you,
so I have to be out.
Thank you, though. We'll take
you up on those I.C.S.
(laughs)
(Robert) Daymond?
(speaks indistinctly)
(laughs)
You know what? I saw it
in flea markets as well.
And, uh, I couldn't keep
the inventory.
I just couldn't keep it. I would
just keep blowing out of it.
I would buy, you know,
200 shirts here,
then I'd come back with 1,000,
and--
Daymond, This would look great
with a pair of fubu jeans.
Yeah.
You know it would. It would.
No, I understand
what you're saying,
but you're too early of a stage
for me to help you
or even to understand if there's
a business to help you.
So...
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
(Robert) You know, you sold 100.
It's a risk.
It's a chance for you to get in
at the ground level and--
It's way too soon.
It's a Hobby.
You haven't--you haven't
proved the market yet.
It's there, though.
It really, really is.
It really is there.
Good pitch, great energy,
but I'm out.
Okay.
Ohh, and you!
Now we're down to one shark.
You know...
you're the best!
All roads lead--Ohh!
(Robert laughs)
Hi, my name is Mark Lim,
this is my beautiful wife Hanna,
and we are the founders
of lollacup.
We are here today seeking
a $100,000 investment
for a 15% equity stake
in our company.
When our first daughter
was only 9 months old,
our pediatrician wanted us
to use straw cups
rather than
the traditional sippys
because of the speech and dental
benefits of using straws.
I must've tried every
toddler straw cup on the market
only to find that most of them
had spill-Proof valves,
like these, that made them
incredibly hard
for her to drink from.
Cleaning them was
even more frustrating.
And unlike all the adorable
baby products out there,
these cups were
just not cute.
So mark and I set out to create
a stylish cup
that both kids
and their parents would love.
As parents ourselves, safety is
really our number one concern.
That's why we decided
to manufacture the product
here in the United States,
so we could be sure
we'd have a quality product
made with safe plastics.
I've seen so many toddlers
struggle with straw cups,
so we designed lollacup to
eliminate all the challenges.
You don't know how many times
my daughter has done this
with her straws
and asked me for more milk,
simply because the straw
was lodged up here
and the liquid was resting
down at the bottom.
Lollacup's weighted straw
keeps it in the liquid,
so children can actually drink
even when the cup is tilted.
The handles
make it easy to hold
But they detach
with a simple twist,
so you can put it in
a cup Holder or diaper bag.
Last but not least,
lollacup is easy to clean.
We are confident that we have
a great product that sells.
We hope you'll join us
with your expertise and funding
to help take lollacup
to the next level.
So do you have sales today
or is that a prototype?
Yes. In the four months
that we've been shipping,
we have 30,000 in sales,
5,000 on order,
and we have a soft order
of $30,000 for the holiday.
How much do you sell them for
into retail?
The retail price is $18,
it wholesales at $9,
and it costs us $4.50 to make.
What does
a normal sippy cup cost?
Anywhere from $5 to $6,
upwards of $25 plus.
And if you were
making these overseas,
how much would your cost
to manufacture them be?
I think if we made them
overseas,
they could probably be made
for about $2, $2,50.
And you're paying how much?
$4.50.
If we were to go
that overseas route,
which really, we don't want to
because we feel like--
I mean, I can't tell you
the number of times
I've been in a baby store
and women literally
walk in and say,
"show me every product here
that's not made in China."
Why do you make the assumption
that a chinese-Made product
in today's global economy
is poorly made?
You know, I'm not making
that assumption.
It's just what
I've personally heard.
And, you know,
the women I've spoken to,
the moms that we hang out with,
they're really looking for
the U.S.A.-,
european-Made products.
'cause I'm having a hard time
paying more than 10 bucks
for a sippy cup.
Yeah, having--Let me just
tell you, I agree with you.
There's just absolutely
no reason
to put your kids' health at risk
over $3.
And I like the weighted, um,
straw idea because
my little son all the time,
you know, doing this...
you know, so I get that.
But the real question
I have is,
have you tried to go to
the bigger box stores?
And what was their response?
Well, we've actually been
approached by several, um,
big box retailers.
We took our prototypes again
to a trade show
last october, and--
What, uh, what big box store?
Um, babies "R" us.
Let me guess. They said it was
way too expensive.
They actually didn't talk much
about price point.
Their main concern was
the packaging.
(mark) What didn't they like?
(Robert) What's wrong
with the packaging?
Yeah,
what didn't they like?
They didn't--
I think it took
too much real estate,
and so they wanted
to change the--
No, it's not stackable.
That's the problem.
Right.
And they didn't--
they said that you couldn't see
the entire product.
That can be fixed.
All that can be fixed.
(Robert) Yeah.
I'm trying to figure out
what it is
that moves millions of units.
Because I've raised two kids.
Sippy cups are a mandatory item.
You have
a better mousetrap here.
What's the price point
that blows it out
so that every American family
can afford it?
I would say $10 to $12.
Okay. So if we have to
sell it at $9.99,
which is a very popular
retail price point...
Mm-hmm.
You gotta make it
for a buck 70.
Right.
Is that your girls there
in the picture,
those adorable girls?
Yes. We have two. (laughs)
Yeah. (laughs)
And do they use the cup
and they--Do they love it?
Yeah, they love it.
They think of it as a toy
when they first see it.
Oh, Hanna, can I see it?
But--Yeah.
Of course. We have some--
Did you create this yourself?
Did you think of this idea?
(mark l.) Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, I love the colors.
The two of you together
or...
um, you know, I mean, I'm the
mom who uses it the most.
So I came with the concept,
but we did work on it together.
(Robert) Thank you.
(Lori) I love your dedication,
and I think that This is
really ingenious
and a great product.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Tell me a little bit
about your story.
Tell me about
the two of you.
Well, mark and I actually
started dating
in the seventh grade.
(laughs) Oh!
So we actually--We got married
14 years later.
(Lori) Wow.
And we started a family
pretty soon after that.
And we think about our daughters
now, we're like,
"no way. We do not want them
dating anyone in seventh grade."
(laughs) Well, if she finds
a nice guy like me,
the I think I'd... (laughs)
So how much have you invested
in this?
We invested, uh, $100,000.
(daymond) okay.
And the--the money went towards
product development...
uh-Huh, casting. I got it.
Industrial design, molds.
And there's a patent
on this?
Yes. We actually just got
an e-mail today,
this morning, that we were
issued the patent.
Congratulations.
(Lori) It's a utility patent?
It's a design patent.
Design patent.
Design. Uh, $100,000...
right.
For 15% means you're putting
the company's value
at a half a million dollars,
around...
right.
So we've signed with a sales rep
to cover the U.S.,
just two, three weeks ago.
Exclusivity?
Pardon?
Did you give them
exclusivity?
Yes, we did, for one year.
Did they give you minimums?
Um, minimum as in--
In other words,
what guarantee do you have
that they'll sell it?
Well, there's no guarantee.
What happens
if they don't sell any?
And you're stuck with them
as the exclusive for one year.
Well ,you know, Hanna and I--
You should never
do a deal like that.
Right.
There's no performance metrics
in that deal?
They said they--We expected
150 to 200 accounts.
Yeah, talk is cheap.
I expect that, too.
Right.
But if they don't deliver,
what happens?
Well, I mean,
if they don't deliver,
we have, you know, I mean--
Guess what.
You'll never do a deal
like that again.
You're gonna learn
the hard way.
(mark) Where are you guys
selling these now?
Which stores?
What kind of stores?
Mostly baby stores,
kids clothing stores...
baby stores.
And some gift shops even.
And--And where are
you holding
the inventory that you have
for this?
(mark and Hanna) In our garage.
(chuckles)
In your garage, huh?
And you guys have been
shipping them yourselves?
Oh, that's a nighttime activity.
Yeah. (laughs)
You don't even know.
Right now, we don't sleep.
We assemble cups
in our living room.
I love this.
I think this is a great idea.
It's really not my market,
and, um, so I wish you
the best of luck with it,
but I'm out.
Let me just start things off
with an offer,
because this is
the new sippy cup.
I agree with you. You've done
a fantastic job.
My offer's contingent.
I'm gonna give you $100,000
for 50% of the company.
You have to source this
offshore
and get the price
below 2 bucks
to make this work.
Then we're going to sell
<i>millions </i>of them.
What do you want to do?
What are your limitations
and what are your opportunities?
I mean, there's no limitations.
There--We--We still go sell.
I mean, we--we don't wait
for them. And they--they don't--
Now do you have to run that sale
back through the sales agent?
Right now, yes.
Okay, and what do you have
to pay the sales agent?
We're paying them 15%.
Wow. Is that for a specific
geographic area?
Uh. It's just--It's the U.S.
The entire U.S. Right now.
Yes.
Mm-Hmm.
Uh, let me just go a little bit
sideways for a second.
I've been--I've been an investor
in, uh, this sector for a while,
and my, uh, my heinie Kicked
pretty badly.
Here's what I learned about
the baby niche market like this.
To make any real money,
you've gotta go
to general distribution,
like every other product.
What's your thought on that?
I think our sales strategy
really--
which we've seen in products
that we end up buying
at target--
We see them in the hands
of trendsetters
and tastemakers first,
and that's where we want them.
And then eventually, we see them
coming down to target,
and then we do it.
I don't disagree
with the strategy,
especially since the obstacle
I see is the sales agent.
Okay.
I don't wanna help you
go get that $10 million order
tomorrow,
or million-Unit order,
and have to give 15%
off the top of that,
of the work that we did,
right.
Right.
I've had the industrial designer
wanna invest.
I've--Our manufacturer
wants to invest.
My--My--
So if they all wanna invest,
you've been walking away
from money to come here?
I wanna play with winners.
I wanna be with guys that I know
will--Will help us--
But you have an offer
on the table.
You don't have to leave
with nothing.
Right.
You're waiting for somebody else
to step up. It seems no one has.
I['m interested in a deal.
I'm gonna match
Voldemort's deal.
$100,000 for 15%
of the company,
contingent that you can get out
of your sales agreement deal.
Okay.
I don't have that contingency.
I'll meet with that person
and motivate them myself
my own special way.
(laughs)
(laughs)
(laughs) I'm sure you will.
Um, and, daymond, are you--
is this the same requirements--
We take the price point down,
do an overseas
manufacturing-Type thing?
If you can get
the price point down
and Buybuy baby says, "listen,
I'll put it in my circular,"
I'll--We'll let them dictate it.
We just may not get an order.
Okay.
And then we'll have to
decide from there.
(mark l.) okay.
It is really about
this--This agent.
Mark, what are you doing here?
Trying to figure out
what I'm gonna do.
You know, not all deals
are easy.
You know, guys, the sales agency
thing is problematic,
but it's the past.
It's happened.
You gotta let that run out.
In--In eight short months.
In eight short months.
(laughs) In eight sh--Now when
you write a check for $100,000,
there's no such thing
as eight short months. Yeah.
(Lori) Yeah.
Mark, you know that
the value is wrong.
You know the value's wrong.
Why don't you throw
another number back at me?
I mean, these offers are
ridiculous. You know that.
Right.
But why don't you throw
a number back at me?
These offers are not ridiculous.
'cause they're real offers.
No real offer's ridiculous.
You know that.
(exhales deeply)
okay. Um...
would you be willing to do
$100,000 for 40%?
Yes. Done.
(chuckles)
Shake on it?
(Lori laughs)
Do we have a deal?
Well, I, you know,
I have to respect...
'cause we're--He just
asked me a question...
(Kevin) Not so fast.
So I to respect... (laughs)
(Hanna laughs)
Sit down.
(daymond) Sit down!
Get back on the bench!
Just one shot. One shot.
(mark c.) if I walk back here...
This is--This is
a-a one-Shot deal?
One-Shot deal.
(daymond) Can I--
can we get two seconds
to talk to my wife?
You can talk all you want,
but if I walk back there...
right.
Can you stand there then
for about...
(sharks laughs)
Please. Respectfully.
About 30 seconds?
You know what?
I'm a basketball guy.
Right.
I'm gonna give you
a 24-Second clock.
24 seconds. Okay.
(Robert) Mark,
do you really--Really--
How rude is that?
Right.
I'm not even finished talking,
and the guy gets up.
I mean.... mark...
right.
15 seconds left.
I'll do the same deal--30%.
(Lori) Oh, you've got
all these offers.
(Kevin) Whoa!
Well, hang on.
What happened there?
I just said I'll do
the same deal for 30%.
Hey, wait a second.
I just beat mark's deal.
Right.
Did you just undercut mark
and...
yep.
And the offer I was gonna...
I don't know your offer.
You keep mumbling over there.
Well, I-I was gonna accept
the offer at $100,000 for 40%,
and then mark just got up
and, uh...
how about this? Would you--
your deal's over?
Mark, would you be willing
to work with Robert?
Because, really, we would really
like your expertise.
(daymond) guys, I gave you
a great offer.
Hey! I gave you a great offer,
but you took too long,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
Mark, would you be willing
to go in with Robert?
Because we would love to have
both of your expertise.
I thought when you sat down,
it was over.
Sometimes I reconsider.
Um, for 40%?
Yes.
Robert,
are you cool with that?
(mark c. And Lori laugh)
Come on, Robert. It's 40%.
That means 50k for each of us,
20% for each of us.
I'm in.
All right. Okay.
First, gotta shake your hand.
There you go.
All right, man. Yeah.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Good job, guys. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Lori) Love your parenting.
Good luck.
Good job, man.
(mark l. And Hanna Laughing)
Thank you. Thanks.
We're gonna be awesome.
Hanna, you could've hugged me,
you didn't have to hug mark.
(laughs)
I-I have exclusivity here.
You know... (laughs)
(sharks laughing)
Oh, they're great.
They're a great couple.
I mean, right at this moment,
I--We're on cloud nine.
But I think it's just motivation
to work even Harder.
Right.
