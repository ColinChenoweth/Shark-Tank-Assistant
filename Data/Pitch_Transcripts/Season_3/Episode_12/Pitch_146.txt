Hi, sharks.
My name Is Paul D'auriac.
(Paul) So I thought,
if that crazy woman
in the airport
loved Debbie's bag
so much,
maybe we should take this
to a retailer,
so we took our line
to henri bendel's
on fifth Avenue,
we can make "Debbie Brooks"
a household name.
(Robert) What's the business?
Okay, But, Paul,
the valuation of the business--
You're asking me
for $540,000 for 20%--
We're about $2.7 million
in value.
Exactly.
Make me excited
that that's a good deal.
$1.2 million is
our gross sales for the company.
Our gross profit is
$685,000.
What does a purse like
this cost?
That's
a $288 retail price point.
Markup at retail is 2.2.
(Robert) So is that a lot, Paul?
Like, I-I don't know.
To an average woman--
Actually, it's--
It's very comfortable.
It's incredibly comfortable.
So, Paul, $288 is high-End?
Comfortable price point
in a jewelry store environment.
All right,
so I-I don't want to--
correct.
Paul, why are you here?
Why do you need the $540,000?
We're ready to take the company
to the next level.
One-Third of that
we wanna put into
direct to consumer advertising.
A third of that
into trade advertising.
The final third would be to
increase our inventory levels,
which are currently
at $240,000.
Debbie, I-I...
I'm not really sure what--
what you're selling today.
A murse person, yes.
(Debbie) a murse.
A metrosexual.
(laughs)
(Robert) Yeah, maybe I'm not
a murse enough guy.
But I found the presentation
a little confusing.
I'm not really sure
what's in the business.
I'm out.
