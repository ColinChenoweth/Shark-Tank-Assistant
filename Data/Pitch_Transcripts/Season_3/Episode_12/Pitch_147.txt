Hi, sharks.
My name Is Paul D'auriac.
And I'm Debbie Brooks,
and we are the owners
of Debbie Brooks handbags,
a unique handbag line
based on my original artwork,
and we are seeking $540,000
in exchange
for a 20% equity position
in our company.
Debbie and I met
on a blind date.
Our first reaction was...
(laughs)
You're not my type.
Fast-Forward 15 years.
Debbie and I are married
to each other.
We have a beautiful baby girl
and, of course, our business.
When we first met, I got fired
from my job, so I said to him,
"I'm gonna come work for you,
'cause if we end up together,
"you'd better make a lot
of money,
'cause now I'm
a starving artist."
So I went to work for him,
selling air conditioning
and refrigeration service
contracts door-To-Door.
But I knew art was
her passion,
so I gave her a check
for $5,000 for christmas
to buy a Booth
at upcoming artexpo New York,
and that's how we launched
the art business.
Then one day,
money got a little tight,
and I couldn't afford to go
shopping for a new handbag,
so I made one,
and a woman loved it
and chased me
through an airport.
She said, "where did you get
that fabulous bag?"
and, sharks, we have some
of those items
for you to look at.
This one we made
for Gwyneth paltrow.
That's one of my favorites.
(daymond) Mm.
This one we made
just for you in mind.
Oh, my goodness.
That's nice.
Oh, that's cool.
(Paul) So I thought,
if that crazy woman
in the airport
loved Debbie's bag
so much,
maybe we should take this
to a retailer,
so we took our line
to henri bendel's
on fifth Avenue,
and that's where we launched
the handbag collection.
Now through all of this,
there's one thing I learned
about women.
Just one?
Just one.
(chuckles)
Women need a different look
to match
every single outfit
they own.
That is why I came up
with the magna fab concept,
short for "Magna fabulous."
Well, this is how they work.
You just push down,
and they're all magnetic.
We are grateful
for the success we've had today,
and we believe, together,
with your involvement,
we can make "Debbie Brooks"
a household name.
(Robert) What's the business?
Are we buying into
just that handbag with that
or all of it?
It's the entire
Debbie Brooks brand.
And we also have two patents.
And what do you want
the money for?
Basically,
our main distribution channel
right now is
jewelry stores.
We're in 1,000 jewelry stores
across the country.
We are typically the first
and only accessory item sold
in these stores.
Because of the economy,
they've been very receptive
to our product category,
and our sell-Through in
that jewelry store environment
Okay, But, Paul,
the valuation of the business--
You're asking me
for $540,000 for 20%--
We're about $2.7 million
in value.
Exactly.
Make me excited
that that's a good deal.
$1.2 million is
our gross sales for the company.
Our gross profit is
$685,000.
What does a purse like
this cost?
That's
a $288 retail price point.
And what'd it cost you
to make?
So wholesale cost on that
is $130 wholesale.
Markup at retail is 2.2.
(Robert) So is that a lot, Paul?
Like, I-I don't know.
To an average woman--
Actually, it's--
It's very comfortable.
It's incredibly comfortable.
Are you guys familiar with
a brand called "Judith leiber"?
I'm sure you are.
(Lori) Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
That was a $2,000 to $3,000
to $5,000 retail price point.
But they're
all swarovski crystals.
They are
swarovski crystals.
Which--
Correct.
Which justifies
that enormous price point.
The secret
to our success is,
we're selling
in a high-End environment,
so the initial perception
of our line in that environment
is these should be $1,000.
So, Paul, $288 is high-End?
Comfortable price point
in a jewelry store environment.
All right,
so I-I don't want to--
correct.
And that's why you're
in jewelry stores, right?
(Debbie) Yes. Exactly.
Precisely.
Because the perception is
completely different.
Yeah. You got it.
You're not in--
It augments the perception.
Y-You're not head-to-Head
with everybody else
and every other purse,
right?
Exactly.
Jewelry stores are having
a tough time right now
because their entry level
price points are very high.
They need something that's gonna
bring in a new customer
and that's gonna build
a collector base
and get them back
into that store.
That's why they love
our line,
and that's why we've had
tremendous success
with the line.
As a woman, do you like it?
Do you hate it? You don't want
to hurt their feelings?
No, I don't hate it.
I like some of them,
but here's
what I'm struggling with.
The only thing, to me,
that is unique and different
is the interchangeability
of your magnet.
Exactly.
We created
this fabrication medium,
3-Dimensional
fabrication medium.
Of that process,
it's entirely patented
by a utility process.
Now we have
a second patent, okay,
which applies
to the adhesion aspect
of the magna fab,
the removal aspect.
So it is the Click-On
and Click-Off.
Precisely. Precisely.
Anybody else can make
a magnet
that fits on the front
of a purse.
You could make a look
that's similar,
but you can't make
this identical look...
I don't think anybody cares.
Without infringing
on our patent.
I-I think there's
a million other ways to do that.
I'm out.
Before you were talking
about patents,
you were talking
about numbers.
Precisely.
Get me back there.
Okay.
28% up 2011 from 2010.
No, But just give me
the forecast for 2011.
Now I did a one--
Top-Line dollars.
$1.6 million.
$1.6 million.
What am I gonna make on it?
Uh, at least $400,000 net.
Paul, why are you here?
Why do you need the $540,000?
We're ready to take the company
to the next level.
One-Third of that
we wanna put into
direct to consumer advertising.
A third of that
into trade advertising.
The final third would be to
increase our inventory levels,
which are currently
at $240,000.
As we continue
to build the brand
and the name recognition
improves,
okay, there are
huge licensing opportunities.
But that's a long shot.
You know, that's p--
That's a long shot.
I'm not a purse guy, obviously.
Not even a murse guy.
Debbie, I-I...
I'm not really sure what--
what you're selling today.
The brand in its entirety.
We wanna build the brand.
(Robert) I...
y-You know, I found it
a little confusing just for me,
maybe because I'm not a...
A murse person, yes.
(Debbie) a murse.
A metrosexual.
(laughs)
(Robert) Yeah, maybe I'm not
a murse enough guy.
But I found the presentation
a little confusing.
I'm not really sure
what's in the business.
I'm out.
Uh, Paul... and Debbie...
I like cash <i>flow. </i>
Me, too.
Love it. I like the way
it rolls off my lips.
That's why we're
in jewelry stores.
I love it.
Cash <i>flow. </i>So...
I look at the cash flow you've
got, and I say to myself,
in your industry--
Fashion--
Would anybody ever pay
9.5 times Free cash flow?
And I don't think they would.
Can I interrupt
a quick second?
You may.
If you're not taking
into account the patent,
the I.P.
--
--
I think your valuation is...
100% too much.
You have to cut this in half.
And having said all that,
I love Debbie's designs...
thank you.
And I will pay you for this.
I'll buy this...
we figured you'd like
that one.
Because it says,
"you're dead to me,"
and you are,
'cause I'm out.
I think you've got
a lot of patent issues here.
I'm not really trusting
what your patent is all about.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay. Well, thank you very much
for your time.
