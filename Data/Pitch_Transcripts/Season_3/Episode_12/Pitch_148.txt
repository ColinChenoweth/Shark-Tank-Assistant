Hi. My name's Nicole Bilski.
And I'm Lindsay Johnson.
Our company is trimi tank.
like Lindsay's wearing today.
How many have you sold?
We have sold approximately 100.
To date.
100,000?
No, 100.
No, 100.
Oh.
1-0-0.
So many dollars is that?
100 units.
Well...
well, right now,
they're retailing for $35.
We're retailing them for $35.
That's $3,500 worth of sales.
Yes.
Yes.
You don't need to think about
what we've done.
You need to think about
what it could be.
How far we've got--
How far it could go.
Yeah, baby! That's right.
That's the pittsburgh spirit,
right?
(Nicole) And where it can go.
Where it can go!
Bec--I mean, really.
I'm gonna ask you
a-a cold, hard truth here.
Sure.
Okay.
When you showed these around
to people,
Wanted to buy this?
(Lindsay and Nicole) We are!
They are!
Apparently none.
They $3,500 in sales.
Shh!
Yeah, but I-I-I just wanna know
the number.
I would say...
approximately... 50?
A lot of them said they didn't
have any money.
A lot of them have commented--
They asked if we...
they weren't there
to buy clothes...
Listen, listen.
Nicole, that was great.
Ladies.
(laughs)
All roads to lead
to Mr. Wonderful in the end.
So here's my offer to you.
We go to a fine restaurant.
I let you choose any bottle
on the list that's worth $3,500,
which is equal to your sales.
When dinner's over,
we burn it all.
How can we let you
kill our baby like that?
This is not a good idea.
I'm out.
I think you guys are
really missing out
on a great opportunity.
You'll see.
Oh, I know. I know.
People love these.
I'm not worried about it.
You'll see, pittsburgh boy.
People love these.
Just rock 'n' roll.
Just go with it.
(singsongy)
See you for dinner!
Ah!
Oh!
(Robert) Never good when a shark
says, "see you for dinner."
(sharks Laughing)
