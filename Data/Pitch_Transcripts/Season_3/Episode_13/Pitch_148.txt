That's a lot of bikes, though,
Fleetwood.
It's not very many bikes
at all.
How many are you doing now?
This is a $600 million market.
Well, no, this is--No...
How many--How many bikes have
you sold per day the past week?
This year, we're gonna sell
350 bikes.
One a day.
Fleetwood, you didn't say
how much it cost you
to make that bike.
What does it cost you?
Including shipping, $245.
All right, $250,000
in sales this year.
How much you gonna make
off that?
We're gonna make
about $50,000.
After you've
paid yourself something?
I haven't paid myself anything.
But like I said--
So if we normalized your salary,
we would break even, right?
(Robert) No.
Don't you think
you're worth $50,000?
We're a little over--I'm worth
a whole lot more than that.
Fleetwood, I think
you're on to something.
I-I buy into the concept.
I <i>love </i>the bikes.
But I think you're trying
to grow too fast, too quickly.
I think you gotta prove
more of the concept,
'cause there are
other competitors.
You gotta catch
your market share.
There's no other competitor
in what we do.
There's cruiser bicycles
that all look the same
that are
in your local bike shop...
right.
That cost almost as much
as these.
Fleetwood, I can't get there
on the $500,000.
I'm out.
All right.
