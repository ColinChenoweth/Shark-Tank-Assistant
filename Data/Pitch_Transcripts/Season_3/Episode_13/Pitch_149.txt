Hi. I'm Queenie Davis...
and I'm Andrew Goodrum,
and we are here today
asking for $100,000
in exchange for 30% equity
in our company.
Today we want
to introduce you
to one
of our original products,
the innovative,
the hot, New boot illusion.
Now boot illusions are
the next step
in ladies footwear.
It's a product that allows you
to go from a boot to a shoe
or a shoe to a boot...
just like that.
Today, I'm wearing a pair
of low-Cut, trendy,
a little funky boots,
but now watch.
The magic begins to happen
when we unzip it.
I simply grip it
and slip it off my foot,
and I'm back in my shoes.
It's that simple.
Now initially when you purchase
a boot illusion,
you not only get
a wonderful boot,
but you get
a fantastic shoe as well.
One of the benefits
of this product
is you can purchase
additional uppers
without having to buy
another shoe.
In fact, you can
interchange this upper
with shoes that you own
and have in your closet already.
The boot illusions comes
in a variety
of styles, colors,
fabrics, and lengths.
You can literally fill
your closet
full of tons
of fantastic boots
at a fraction of the cost
of traditional boots
and less than a quarter
of the space.
This product is a Winner.
This is the original,
hot, New boot illusion.
Anything else is
just bootleg.
(laughs)
Boot-a-licious!
(mark and Queenie Laugh)
Can we look at it?
Sure, and I want you
to know,
these are, uh, boots that are
made at my kitchen table,
so the sewing is not great,
and I don't claim to be
a s--a seamstress,
but I-I just--
So you haven't sold
any boot illusions yet,
if this is prototypes, right?
Not boot illusions, uh, no.
Our company, uh--
in June,
we went to a trade show,
and we did sell about
$130,000 worth
of our other product.
Which other product?
What's the other product?
Uh--
um, our other products
are rain boots
as well as, um...
why don't you pull 'em out?
Interchangeable sandals.
So, Queenie, you're just
selling equity
in just
the boot illusions line?
Absolutely not.
It's the company.
So you make the whole thing...
Yes.
Just a standard boot
and sandal?
Yes.
And you're doing all this
out of your house?
Uh, no. Uh, a funny story.
Uh, we... (chuckles)
We came up with these products
at the end of last year.
I had a dream that I went
to turkey,
so I literally jumped
on a plane, went to turkey,
and found a manufacturer.
These are--
How did you get to turkey?
Well, I just heard "Turkey--
We're boarding" in my ear.
I was try--We was trying
to figure out
where we was gonna go.
Right.
I don't want
to sound flighty,
but, you know, I was really
concentrating on it.
You already sound flighty,
so don't worry about it.
(laughs)
Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, don't worry
about that.
(laughs)
(Andrew) right.
That ship has sailed.
So--But I did.
I just literally booked
a flight and said,
"Andrew, we gotta go
to turkey."
He said, "no, <i>you </i>gotta go
to turkey."
Right.
"I gotta work." (chuckles)
So I did. I went to turkey.
Right.
(chuckles)
I didn't know anyone there.
Uh, amazing.
It was just by happenstance
that they were having
a large shoe show.
Are you two married?
No, we're not.
No, we're--
We're very good friends.
Can a woman walk
in those shoes inside a boot?
It seems clunky.
No, it's not clunky at all.
No, not the way it's designed.
Uh--
It's well-Designed,
actually.
Right.
But it's not gonna work...
it leaves
the important part.
Yes.
In the winter, is it,
Queenie?
It abs--
I mean, if you go
in New York city in the slush
with this, it's not gonna
protect the shoe.
Yes, it is. It's rubber.
It--It works--It works best
in the winter.
How much money have
you invested,
and is it all your money?
So far, we invested about
$40,000 of our own money.
And what's the split
in ownership
between the two of you?
50/50.
When you guys disagree,
how do you decide?
I mean, we haven't had
that problem.
That's because you're not
sleeping together.
No, we've dis--
(men laugh)
Yeah, well, we've disagreed
a lot.
(laughs)
We disagree a lot.
Right.
Yeah.
What's the price range?
About $25 is
the manufacturer cost.
The tall ones--About $32.
Now, listen, the average cost
of a tall, leather boot is $299.
We're gonna retail these boots
anywhere from $129 to $179.
What's the cost
on this one here?
The r--
the one you have
on your foot--
the cost of that
to make it...
This is $25, right?
And what do you
sell it for?
Yes. Yes.
(Andrew) right. $25.
$25.
To make it?
$25 to make it.
And to sell it for?
Uh, $79.99.
To the store?
No, to our end customer.
Your end customer
being who?
Your--
Yeah. Our, uh--
the--the--
Our direct customers.
So online customers?
Online. Yes.
Oh, you're not selling
to retail outlets?
Oh, you don't--
Well, you know, that's what
we've been doing
at the trade shows.
You know, stores, boutiques
come in and purchase it.
But you don't have
a large retail presence?
You don't have somebody--
No. No.
No, right now we're trying
to get a voice
for the, um, boot illusions.
Barbara, what do you think
about these?
I think it's ingenious,
and you know why
it's a great product?
Shoes are so expensive.
I hate ruining a pair of shoes
and paying the Shoemaker again
to re-Sole my shoes.
It's terrible,
and if I could save the money
by Just slipping something
really cool-Looking
on top of my shoe...
I love this product.
So, Queenie,
I don't understand anything
about women's shoes
or fashions.
I think
it's a pretty good idea,
just nothing that
I'm gonna add any value to.
I'm out.
Guys, the bottom line is
I have no feel
for the retailing
of women's fashion,
so I can't help you
at all...
okay.
Okay.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Queenie, I love your shtick.
I love it, you know? You've got
an answer for everything...
(laughs)
Yes.
But here's something
that grinds me back to reality.
Yes.
You know, I look
at numbers...
Mm-hmm.
All right?
You're doing $120,000
in sales.
If you paid yourself
even a $40,000-a-year salary,
you make no money. Zero.
You're not profitable yet.
You're telling me
your business--
'cause you're gonna sell me
30% for $100,000--
Is worth close to $300,000--
More than $300,000.
It's not...
we understand it's not.
And--
If you know
it's not worth that,
why did you ask me
for that value?
Why did you do that?
Because--
How do I punish you
for that mistake?
Listen, these shoes, to women,
are like boys and Candy.
Once you see something
you like...
(chuckles)
You--It--It gets
in your head.
(Robert laughs)
You gotta have it,
and you--You don't stop
until you get it.
I have a voice in my head, too.
You know what it says?
Mm-hmm.
I'm out.
Oh.
That's good. Thank you.
Thank you for listening.
I do appreciate it.
So you went to turkey.
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)
Did you just walk
the streets?
Did you know anybody there?
I'm--I'm--
(Andrew chuckles)
Absolutely not.
I didn't know anyone. Um--
And how did you get
to a manufacturer in turkey?
(Andrew) The--
Uh, the--the--
because... (chuckles)
the--
Because, uh,
there was a woman
who a friend of mine knew
who knew a doctor
who had--Knew someone
who had a family member
who worked in the shoe industry.
Wow.
(Andrew chuckles)
of course.
I'm a dreamer,
and I didn't think
of this product.
I had a dream
of the boot illusions.
Wait, Wait, wait, wait.
All of a sudden, in a dream,
building boot illusions
came to you?
Well, my cousin visited me,
and I was, like--
It, uh--
I was looking
at her boots...
it sounds wild, but...
and I was like...
(chuckles)
"Wow, those are so nice."
She--and then she laughed
and she said,
"those aren't really boots.
These are boot illusions."
And she unzipped it
and took it off.
I said, "I gotta see it,"
so I looked at it--
she had the product?
In the dream.
This is all in a dream.
Oh, this is a dream. Oh.
So the next morning...
(laughing)
I went out
and bought a machine.
You're telling
the movie backwards.
Yeah. (chuckles)
Yeah.
Really. Really.
So I have an offer.
I want to give you
the $100,000 for...
75%...
of just
the boot technology,
because I want
to license it.
Every dollar that comes in--
You will get 25 cents of it.
You just open
your mailbox...
hmm.
And see the money.
So are you willing to step
aside on this business
and just say, "sure, do with it
whatever you want, daymond"?
absolutely not.
All right.
Then listen to my deal.
So now you're gonna do a deal
with a real estate agent?
Let me listen.
Let's--Let me hear.
Let's hear her deal.
So I'm gonna give you
$100,000 for 55%...
Mm-hmm.
Not because I'm greedy...
Mm-hmm.
But because I know
$100,000 ain't gonna
make it happen...
right.
Right?
And I'm also gonna take 55%
because I-I'm honestly
more experienced than you
at s--Building a business.
Absolutely.
Sure. Sure.
Every one of the entrepreneurs
I invested in have--
Are making a fortune, all right?
And I think my worth is--
Should certainly the--be
the majority interest.
And by the way,
she's gonna all of a sudden
be in
the manufacturing business
and learn that business,
too, with you.
Queenie, when you call
Barbara and say,
"I want to go to the Cobb show
Or nasby SHOW,"
whatever the c--May--
Case may be,
she won't have
the slightest idea
what you're talking about.
You know, that is so untrue.
(Kevin) Okay, wait a second.
Queenie, listen.
This is not her business.
Listen, I am
your sleep therapist,
and it's now time to make
a decision.
(sighs)
before you start dreaming again,
you're still here
in the real world.
What are you going to do?
You know what I want you to do
before you make a decision?
and call any entrepreneur I've
gone into business with...
ohh.
Oh, god.
And see what they say.
Listen, and I believe
in you, so...
N--
We accept. Yes.
(Robert) WHOO!
(Kevin) Whoa.
(mark)
There you go, Barbara.
Way to go, Barbara!
And you know what?
You've got great judgment.
Yes. Yes. (chuckles)
Well, daymond, she showed you.
(mark) Daymond, hey.
She didn't show me crap.
No, she didn't.
No, she didn't.
No way.
You made a great decision.
I know I did. I know.
(chuckles) Thank you.
Are you crazy?
(Robert) Andrew,
I'm looking at you...
huh?
And I just want to know,
do I sense a little doubt
in your eye?
Uh... (sighs)
'cause you're 50/50 owners.
A guy with 20 years' experience
in the business?
"Let's go
with a real estate agent."
I don't--I don't regret it,
but I-I did favor
the godfather of urban fashion.
So we--and we appreciate
every one of you,
and, Barb, I just thank you.
Thank you for the offer.
I love you back.
I love you. (chuckles)
okay.
Sweet dreams.
Good luck, guys.
Bye. All right. (chuckles)
(chuckles)
75% of the company?
No. Mnh-Mnh.
She should have went with me.
My structure's in place.
Uh-huh.
I'm telling you now,
that was a big mistake.
Daymond, she dreamt
about going to turkey.
She dreamt the product up
in a dream.
Yeah.
Now she can dream about
the $5 million of sales
that could have been
done tomorrow.
That $5 million just flew
out the window.
My initial gut was, um,
really to go with daymond.
But 75% was way too much,
and so we're so happy
Barbara gave us a deal.
