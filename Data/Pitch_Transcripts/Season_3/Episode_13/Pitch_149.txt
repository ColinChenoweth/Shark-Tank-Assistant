My name is Fleetwood,
and this is my dog Deville.
He's also the brand icon
of my company, villy customs.
We looking for
a $500,000 investment
for a 33% stake
in our company.
Villy customs is the new way
to buy your bike.
Ladies and gentlemen,
give me a drumroll, please.
the world's first
fully customizable fashion bike.
Anyone from ages 8 to 80
can go to our web site
and select the colors
and the styles
and create their bike
the way they want it to be--
wild and crazy
or sophisticated and smooth.
I've taken
my background experience
in the fashion industry
and crossed over
into a whole new market.
As you can see
from the screen,
using our Web site, you can
select all your part colors
and see what your bike is gonna
look like <i>before </i>you buy it.
With all the features
that we offer,
you can build
over 1 billion bikes,
and not one
would be the same.
Villy customs
is about to explode.
We have the product,
we have the passion,
and we have the know-How to
become a major lifestyle brand.
I know you can't resist Deville
or these amazing bikes.
So who'd like to gear up and get
rolling with villy customs?
(pants and groans)
(sharks laugh)
I'm in.
(Robert) All right,
I'll scratch his tummy.
But do you have the sales?
Uh, currently, uh, we're
projecting $250,000 in Sales.
Uh, he's having a good time.
(mark) He is.
Uh, $250,000 in sales
for 2011.
Uh, we've only started
our Web site 12 months ago,
and we've already
increased sales by 100%.
What were your--So your sales
last year were $125,000?
$129,000,
and that was out of
a brick-And-Mortar retail store.
Um, we were just selling sort
of, like, regular bikes, though.
And, Fleetwood,
are the sales today are online?
100%.
And let me add, too--
No advertising.
We have not spent a dollar
on any type of advertising.
And would the total cost
of the bike be
once I customize?
The sales prices right now
on our bikes
are averaging $641
for a fully customized bike.
That is not cheap.
(mark) That's a lot of bike.
That's not great--That's
not--That's not expensive.
It's a very high end,
high end price point for bikes.
Kevin, have you ever seen
a-a cruiser bike like this?
No, no.
I-I-I get it, but--
But the idea is that this is
a fashion statement
towards a higher end
demographic.
A designer bike.
Yeah.
This is a style accessory.
And I will just say this,
you guys.
The customers
that have bought our bikes,
they don't even question
the price.
If we sell ten bikes a day,
we'll be doing
$2.1 million in sales.
That's a lot of bikes, though,
Fleetwood.
It's not very many bikes
at all.
How many are you doing now?
This is a $600 million market.
Well, no, this is--No...
How many--How many bikes have
you sold per day the past week?
This year, we're gonna sell
350 bikes.
One a day.
Fleetwood, you didn't say
how much it cost you
to make that bike.
What does it cost you?
Including shipping, $245.
All right, $250,000
in sales this year.
How much you gonna make
off that?
We're gonna make
about $50,000.
After you've
paid yourself something?
I haven't paid myself anything.
But like I said--
So if we normalized your salary,
we would break even, right?
(Robert) No.
Don't you think
you're worth $50,000?
We're a little over--I'm worth
a whole lot more than that.
(mark and daymond Laugh)
Yeah, but I'm trying
to figure out--
This is why I've been
doing this. This is my baby,
and I'm--I've put in blood,
sweat, and tears on this.
All I gotta do
is get out there.
Example--NBA, sports teams,
schools, colleges,
organizations.
But somebody has to do that.
Then you gotta build them
and you gotta get the orders.
Let me
point another problem out.
Maybe, uh, the dog can answer
this question.
He doesn't look like he's gonna
be answering it. (chuckles)
$500,000
for 33% of the business.
That means
you're valuing this concept
at a million and a half dollars.
Yes.
You don't make any money yet.
All right, why's it worth
a million and a half dollars?
We have an incredible brand.
We have an incredible product.
People are crazy
about our product.
You guys,
I am not just saying that.
I get testimonials from people
that receive our bikes
that are literally so excited
they're almost crying.
Our bikes in any bike Shop
would blow away
anybody in this market.
We're just trying to do it
a different way
because it's
a made-to-Order bike.
I've funded the whole business
with my own cash.
I haven't--
and--And how much
has that been?
$185,000.
$185,000?
Out of my retirement account,
too.
So sometimes
what's happening is, right now,
we're actually stalling
our growth by--We're saying,
hey, we're no longer
taking orders right now.
And we will cut people off
for a little bit of time.
And people wanna
buy the bikes,
but we can't build them
fast enough.
Yeah, that's a pretty sexy
sales approach, though,
to say, "We're running behind."
Customers love it.
They tend to stay with you.
Yeah, it's True.
I have two words for you.
Great design.
Thank you.
Incredible. But...
I appreciate that
coming from you.
Even though
It's a great design,
it's just a space
I don't want to be in.
I'm out.
No problem.
Let me give you a little
endorsement as to your price,
because I am your sweet spot.
I buy, on average,
four bikes a year.
It sounds absurd.
Dang.
And I buy them
without the speed.
I just--These simple bikes.
And I pay, every single year,
$550 per bike
to get a piece of crap
that doesn't last
at a beach resort I live in,
'cause it rots.
Exactly.
All right? They don't
look sexy. They don't look fun.
This is like a cute little
corvette, but it's a bike.
So how much
are you offering him, Barbara?
I'm not. I'm just...
I'm just telling you this
price point is a great deal...
that was--That was worth...
for this kind of bike.
That advice was worth
what you paid for it.
This product is
a total, total Winner.
I am 100% certain.
I'm very much stuck on the value
you've put on your business.
It's not profitable.
Look, you've taken a commodity,
a bicycle,
and made it
a fashion statement.
Correct.
That's cool.
I even like the dog.
But I am not gonna give you
$500,000
for a third of this company.
You're just--I-I don't know
if the company's worth
half a million dollars yet.
I mean, it's--It's--
It's embryonic at this point.
You've gotta sell a ton of bikes
to prove it out.
20 bikes a day, we're doing
$4.3 million a year.
This is a untapped market.
There's people
that see our bikes
that don't even know
this type of bike exists.
You're not a bad salesman.
I gotta tell ya.
Thank you.
I mean, I'm impressed.
But look, I'm out.
Fleetwood, I think
you're on to something.
I-I buy into the concept.
I <i>love </i>the bikes.
But I think you're trying
to grow too fast, too quickly.
I think you gotta prove
more of the concept,
'cause there are
other competitors.
You gotta catch
your market share.
There's no other competitor
in what we do.
There's cruiser bicycles
that all look the same
that are
in your local bike shop...
right.
That cost almost as much
as these.
Fleetwood, I can't get there
on the $500,000.
I'm out.
All right.
Where is your brand
on that bike?
I'm not seeing it
as I look at it.
These are all handmade,
hand-Painted
limited edition badges.
But that goes on the very front
as I'm seeing that.
Correct, which is
how bikes do it. Okay?
Mm-hmm.
We also do custom seat covers,
custom designs, branding.
Anything, chains or, like--
This is a show-Off bike.
It really is.
I know you guys are saying
It's expensive,
but think about it.
For $650, you are--
Yeah, I'm not saying it.
No, those are these guys.
I'm not thinking
it's expensive either.
No. Thank you.
Appreciate that.
Barbara, Barbara,
I agree with you in that
for a show-Off,
this is it.
There is nothing else
like that.
For $650, you're getting
transportation, exercise,
eco-Friendly,
and head-Turning.
People can't--
Stop.
You've sold me.
I would really like
to make an offer on this deal.
I could smell the money
flowing from trees.
You wanna partner on this
with me?
Yeah, I do, actually.
But I-I don't think 30%
is enough.
I would agree.
That's the difference.
Not even for
This incredible product here?
(mark) That's not the point.
(laughs)
It's gonna take
a lot of money, honey.
(Robert) Wow.
Look, the point, it's--It's--
It's the amount of money,
but it's also--Success requires
effort, as you know.
For us to really contribute,
it has to be more than capital.
And so I think
that's the difference.
And so I would be willing--
If Barbara wants
to split it with me--
$500,000
for 45% of the company.
You know, mark, you plucked
that 45% right out of my head.
There you go.
So if Barbara's in agreement--
So we've gotta be right.
Two people think this way.
Barbara can definitely
hook us up in New York,
which is critical and--
Forget about New York.
I could hook you up everywhere.
Yeah. So the offer is,
Barbara and I jointly together,
$500,000 for 45% of the company.
Okay, I got a--
I got a question for you.
Sure.
What about 40%?
Because here's the deal...
really, honestly, I feel like
we're about to just explode.
We are about to take off.
And I feel like I'm really
giving up a huge amount of money
for basically
2 1/2 years of...
I haven't made a penny.
I've put a lot into this.
I've created the brand.
I-I know we've got...
not 2 1/2 years.
Yes, it is 2 1/2 years.
It's way more than that
because you come as a talent
as well.
Right.
Okay. Props. I agree.
So your blood, sweat,
and tears.
Okay, what if we split
the difference?
42%?
Barbara?
42%'s okay with me.
I'll do--You do 42%...
we got a deal?
I think that we got a deal,
and I think you guys got
an incredible deal.
That's the only kind
of deals we do. (laughs)
And a fun deal as well.
Cool.
Ah!
And my first Order is gonna be
for a mavs version.
You got it.
You gotta put me ahead
of the line. I'm ordering one.
You got it. All right. Okay.
Thanks, man.
Thanks, guys! Appreciate it.
Giving up 42%,
I feel like I gave away
a little bit too much,
but I do think mark and Barbara
were the right choice for us.
So overall, I'm really happy
and I am excited.
