Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim Pittman.
I'm from
yorba Linda, california,
So, Jim, let's say 1 in 10 guys
with a pickup truck want
an air mattress in the back.
How do I find them?
Where do I sell
this air mattress?
How do I get to my customer?
What does it cost me
to get to that customer?
The--currently, we're, uh,
we're already in all--
Pretty much all
the major warehouse stores,
on their dot-Coms.
We're, you know,
go to any of your
automotive accessory stores.
Go to
the sporting goods side.
Now you--'cause you're going
hunting, fishing,
to the river,
to the desert--
Does one size fit all,
or do I have to have
a different mattress...
No.
For every design of pickup?
No. We, uh--
with some
of our engineered features,
one size fits
your full-Size 8-Foot beds.
One size fits
your full-Size 6-Foot beds.
Jim, one important detail--
How easy is it
to pump this thing up?
Can I do it,
as a woman, all by myself?
Absolutely.
Do you need a gang
of people?
If I could show you?
Yeah.
Simple as turning
on the button.
(whirring)
Jim, why do you have
so much inventory in stock?
Well, it would seem that way,
but--But, y-You know,
Uh, per year--
Jim, what percentage of people
need a mattress
in the back of their truck?
Go to any desert, any beach,
any place where you, uh--
there's--
Jim, can I try it?
Absolutely. Please.
Help me with this, Jim.
Barbara, you want to get
in bed with me?
No, thank you. No. (laughs)
Is this sturdy?
It's a truck.
Jump on it.
(chuckles)
whoo!
Oh. (chuckles) Gee.
Whoa.
Yeah, while Robert's sleeping
on the job, as usual...
(laughs)
Can I ask you
some questions, jimbo?
(Jim) You bet.
Um, how much money
do you have in this?
I've got over $250,000
of my own money invested
into the project.
Wow.
Wow.
(Barbara) wow.
Well, where'd that money
come from?
(speaks indistinctly)
S-So, jimbo...
it's--
in a--
How do you solve
that problem?
Easy. Uh, y--
Uh, we're--We're--
Spend a ton of money
marketing.
No, not at all. Not at all.
(speaks indistinctly)
Okay, Jim.
Let me ask you again.
Why--
Why are you only selling
$200,000 of the world's best
back-of-the-Truck air mattress?
You can dominate a niche.
But the problem, Jim,
is that you haven't
been dominating.
You know, you've got the--
Well--
You've got what appears to be
a great product, you know,
but something's missing.
You're telling us
these numbers.
You're telling us
there's a market there,
That's the problem.
Tell me why I'm wrong, Jim.
But--No.
You're speaking the truth
of what you know.
You--There--
there's still additional--
All I know is
you're not selling anything.
Well, we're not selling
because we don't have
a sales force that's
going out there to sell.
That's the reason?
We--we have you,
the buyers, coming to us,
saying,
"we like the product."
Jim, you keep on Digging B--
Deeper holes, right?
Yeah.
If I had my life savings,
everything,
on the line in a business,
which I've had before,
where if I don't sell,
I don't eat--
Jim...
you're not selling.
You're putting it on shelves,
Jim, four sharks are out.
You got one shot left--Barbara.
I just love the product.
There's a lot of guys
with trucks out there,
but I have a couple
of detail questions
that are
enormously important.
One, do you have a patent
on the mattress
or the blowup device?
I have a--I have four patents
on the mattress.
(sighs)
What bothers me most about
your pitch today--
Because I can see
you're not a businessman.
Wait. Jim. Jim, let me--
Let me recast her offer.
I--
Yeah.
I get it.
I get it, all right, man?
You really do get it?
I don't think
you fully get it.
(Robert) Well, if--
she's saying,
"I'm gonna come work
for you full-Time,"
because you can't sell
but she can,
