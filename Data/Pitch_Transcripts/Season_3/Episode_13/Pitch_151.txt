My name's Scotty Olson.
I'm from
the land of 10,000 lakes,
and I'm also the innovator
and founder
of skyride technology.
I'm here today seeking
a $3 million investment
for a 20% stake
in this exciting company.
Whoa.
Let's take a look
at the moving star in action.
As you can see,
skyride's much like
a thrilling ride
of a Roller coaster,
but more than that,
it's powered by you,
the skyriders.
We're gonna be launching
fitness, recreation,
transportation in the sky
and getting people
of all ages
and, more importantly,
of all abilities
flying and moving faster
than they can possibly ride
their bicycle.
This is exciting.
It's real.
You're one of the very first
to see it,
and we're looking
for the right partner
to come on board to help us
take it to the world.
Scotty, are you nuts?
(Robert chuckles)
Uh, I've been told that
many times over the years.
I've been, um, inventing
innovating products.
That's a passion of mine.
Have you invented anything
in the past that we would know?
My claim to fame is
the rollerblade inventor.
I started the company
25 years ago,
and a lot of people said
the same thing to me.
You know, "that's never
gonna happen,"
uh, and I proved 'em wrong.
Scotty, you invented
rollerblades?
I-I did. I did.
I'm the--I'm the--that's
my claim to fame,
and I made a ton of money.
How much money
did you actually make
on that rollerblade adventure?
Oh, enough money
to--to, uh...
can you give us a number
to just--
Oh, you're relentless
on that. Um...
okay, well, let's play the game.
Was it more than $5 million?
Oh, yeah. I made
more than $5 million.
Was it more than $20 million?
Oh, boy. It's been so long ago,
I can't remember it.
Oh, come on now!
(daymond laughing)
Come on. Come on, Scotty.
You can--
You know what?
You never forg--
Scotty...
it's like your first date.
Has anybody ever--
I had a--I had a shark
come in...
Yeah.
And, uh--
Funny he pointed to you.
Yeah.
A bad shark?
And took advantage of it,
because my business partner
embezzled all my money from me.
Scotty, did you actually bring
rollerblades to the market,
or did you just simply invent it
and then sell it to someone?
Yeah, it's, uh--Uh,
I brought it to the market,
and I want to make
another star,
and, um, my commitment
to this product, the skyride,
it's, uh,
it's a big picture,
because I've had this idea
going on for 20 years.
How did you come up
with the idea?
I came up with the idea
because, uh, I wanted to be able
to create a superfast machine
that you could train on,
so I thought, wow, it would
be really cool to be
on a track and not have
to really worry about
other bikes or cars
or, um, anything like that.
Tell us the vision.
Let's say, like,
sky clubs,
where people would come in,
and they would,
you know, pay
anywhere from $25
to maybe $100
to train
on the sky track...
No, but what--What--
or the sky machine.
What do you have today? Do you
have anything working or--
Oh, yeah. Uh--Uh,
as you saw in the video,
I invested... (chuckles) Uh,
a considerable amount of time...
How much?
And money.
I have, uh, close
to half a million dollars.
Let me ask you a question,
staying on the money theme
for a second,
keeping you focused there.
I can buy 20% of this
for $3 million cash from you.
That means you're telling me
the whole business,
the concept is worth
$15 million.
Easy.
Do you have any sales?
No, I don't have sales,
but we have...
good, 'cause that could've--
Letters of intent.
That could've confused it.
What's the vision for you
to monetize this?
This isn't something
I'm gonna buy for my house.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you could.
I call it the yard gym,
because I have people
right now--
Like, uh, to answer
your question,
I don't have a sale yet...
right.
But we have, uh,
people that are interested.
How many acres of land
did it require?
I mean, it could be,
uh, 100 feet long,
and you could have
a really nice, tight track.
You'd be like a gerbil
on a wheel.
(laughs)
Well, you might need 200 feet,
but it isn't the distance
as much as the movement...
whoo! (chuckles)
(chuckles)
You know, because how long
can you stay...
I mean...
on a stationary bike?
Scotty, you're asking families
to take up their whole backyard
with infrastructure--
Posts, cement...
okay, but that's--
(Barbara) Scott.
That's a--that's just
a part of it.
Time out.
I so respect you
for this enormous dream
you have,
but I just don't think
it's going to happen,
so I might as well clear
the deck and say I'm out.
Okay, that's not a problem,
but--But thanks
for being honest...
okay.
And I like that,
but we had, uh--uh...
I wish I believed.
Many different markets come
to us--Uh, recreation,
and the big one
that we're going after now
is in the billion-Dollar
ski industry.
So the plan is to sell it
to ski resorts?
That's, well, that's the l--
That's the low-Hanging fruit
for us right now.
Scott, it looks incredible,
but I wouldn't even know
where to start,
so I'm out.
But you may want one
in your backyard.
I'm out.
Scotty, my sense of you--
and I-I want you to take this
in a positive light--
is you're the inventor/idea guy.
You're not an executional guy,
in terms of doing any
of this stuff.
I took rollerblades from nothing
and started that company.
If you came to ride it,
you might say,
"Hey, I want one
for my backyard."
You know what? I do like
the idea for my backyard.
Yeah.
(Robert) Yeah. It--
I think it would be
really, really cool...
Well, s--
But my problem, Scotty, is
that it's gonna take a lot
of construction management
expertise.
I agree.
That's not--That's not me.
I don't have any expertise
there at all,
and so for that reason,
I have to drop out.
(clicks tongue)
Scotty, I-I love things
that make you go fast,
but I don't see the large-Scale
consumer application for it.
No, uh, we--That--That's not
our main focus in the backyard.
It's certainly
the ski resorts.
Scotty, it's
an admirable goal,
but I can't fly with you
on this.
I'm out.
Okay, I'm the only guy left,
Scotty, and here's what I say.
I wish every investment I made
made money, But they don't.
Some fail.
You should think about
your ideas the same way.
This is a dog from hell.
This is a very bad idea.
It howls at the moon,
and you should take it out
behind the barn
and shoot it.
It's over with this one.
Get something else going.
This sucks.
No, I'm just starting.
I'm out.
Go get 'em, Scott.
Go get 'em.
Go get 'em.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
Appreciate it.
Nice to see ya.
Didn't want those guys anyhow.
We're looking for an Angel,
not a shark.
Personally, if this was
an amusement park...
It'd be cool.
I would pay...
You'd try it.
To ride it, to play it...
it looks very cool.
Because I would say--
You need a small--
Oh, my god.
You need a smaller model.
This was made
for mark cuban.
You gotta be 7 feet tall
to use this.
Next.
