Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim Pittman.
I'm from
yorba Linda, california,
and my product is airbedz,
the original
truck Bed air mattress.
I'm here today seeking
$250,000
for a 15% equity stake
in my company.
Airbedz is
a custom-Designed air mattress
Specifically made to fit
in the bed of pickup trucks.
Our greatest features
are the cutouts
in the mattress sides,
which allows the mattress
to go around
and, more importantly,
over top of the wheel wells,
creating a sleep area
that utilizes
the entire back
of the truck.
With our rugged, heavy-Duty
cloth construction,
and our built-In pump
with both inflate
and deflate options,
airbedz now creates
a mattress that's--
a good night's sleep is
just an inflate away.
I believe in this product.
I know this product will be
a big success.
Why?
The camping industry is
a $56-Billion-a-year industry.
Is there that big a need
for people to sleep
in their pickup trucks?
There's, uh, there's a major
need. I mean, just try a--
So, Jim, let's say 1 in 10 guys
with a pickup truck want
an air mattress in the back.
How do I find them?
Where do I sell
this air mattress?
How do I get to my customer?
What does it cost me
to get to that customer?
The--currently, we're, uh,
we're already in all--
Pretty much all
the major warehouse stores,
on their dot-Coms.
We're, you know,
go to any of your
automotive accessory stores.
Go to
the sporting goods side.
Now you--'cause you're going
hunting, fishing,
to the river,
to the desert--
Does one size fit all,
or do I have to have
a different mattress...
No.
For every design of pickup?
No. We, uh--
with some
of our engineered features,
one size fits
your full-Size 8-Foot beds.
One size fits
your full-Size 6-Foot beds.
Jim, one important detail--
How easy is it
to pump this thing up?
Can I do it,
as a woman, all by myself?
Absolutely.
Do you need a gang
of people?
If I could show you?
Yeah.
Simple as turning
on the button.
(whirring)
Oh, you have a pump.
And battery-Operated.
The pump not only--
The pump not only inflates
your mattress...
(clicks, whirring continues)
You turn the Dial
to deflate it.
(Click, whirring stops)
now where's
the power source for that?
The pump operates off
a rechargeable
12-Volt battery.
There we go. Okay.
It's included in your packet,
and you have your home charger,
so you just plug and go.
Oh, that's cool.
It plugs
into your cigarette lighter,
so we always say, "bag to bed
"in 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes,
"depending upon the application
of your truck--
Do you have an 8-Foot bed
or the 6-Foot bed?"
what are your sales?
Sales last year
were $210,000.
This year we're already
at $220,000.
What's your cost
of goods sold?
To--to make one mattress,
$50 to $60,
and we sell it
for $199 to $209.
That's retail,
though, right?
That's m.S.R.P.
And so when you sell it
to the camping stores,
what do you sell it--
Anywhere from $125
to, at some of
the bigger box stores, $145.
And, again, how many did
you say you sold so far?
This--This year,
about 1,700.
And the year before?
About 1,600.
You've come here to borrow money
to expand your business
and to build
inventory, right?
Well, n--We already have
about $400,000 in inventory
sitting in the warehouse
as we speak.
So you don't need inventory.
What do you need
my $250,000 for?
Uh, we're gonna--
The additional money would be
to bring in additional staffing.
Jim, why do you have
so much inventory in stock?
Well, it would seem that way,
but--But, y-You know,
with the understanding that
I'm a one-Man band
at the office.
You know, I'm dealing
with the big box stores.
I'm dealing
with the marketing,
so it takes away
a ton of time...
No, but--But why so--
So we have--
Why so much inventory?
Did you have to buy
that quantity
to get the price point?
No.
No, that's what I chose
to buy.
I got a feeling this is
a small niche market.
No, th--I mean, uh--
Uh, per year--
Jim, what percentage of people
need a mattress
in the back of their truck?
Go to any desert, any beach,
any place where you, uh--
there's--
Jim, can I try it?
Absolutely. Please.
Help me with this, Jim.
Barbara, you want to get
in bed with me?
No, thank you. No. (laughs)
Is this sturdy?
It's a truck.
Jump on it.
(chuckles)
whoo!
Oh. (chuckles) Gee.
Whoa.
Yeah, while Robert's sleeping
on the job, as usual...
(laughs)
Can I ask you
some questions, jimbo?
(Jim) You bet.
Um, how much money
do you have in this?
I've got over $250,000
of my own money invested
into the project.
Wow.
Wow.
(Barbara) wow.
Well, where'd that money
come from?
(speaks indistinctly)
I'm a general contractor
and a real estate developer,
so I buy small houses,
bulldozer 'em,
and build big houses
on the lot.
How many competitors
do you have?
There's one person making
an air mattress
for the back of the truck.
It is not supported
by our patent,
and it has--none of 'em are
with a built-in pump,
so if you have
an air mattress--
I've never seen one
with a built-In pump.
I'll give you that.
Yeah, so--
Could--
Look, you've got
$400,000 in inventory...
correct.
Right?
Why are you not
selling more?
I mean, you're--
if it's international...
well--
and you're online, anybody
can place an order, right?
They could.
Bingo, Mr. Cuban.
It's because this is
a fractionally tiny market.
That's exactly
what This is telling you.
Mm.
He's got the best product
in the world,
and yet he's Only doing $100,000
worth of profit a year on it.
There should be
$2, $3, $4 million.
S-So, jimbo...
it's--
in a--
How do you solve
that problem?
Easy. Uh, y--
Uh, we're--We're--
Spend a ton of money
marketing.
No, not at all. Not at all.
(speaks indistinctly)
Okay, Jim.
Let me ask you again.
Why--
Why are you only selling
$200,000 of the world's best
back-of-the-Truck air mattress?
And there's no comp--
What's the problem?
Nobody makes it. Why? Why?
Well, with your expertise...
No.
Y-You're bringing
in a n--a new--a new--
I am not an air mattress guy,
and, believe me, the rest
of these bozos aren't either.
At the end of the day...
no, they're not, but you--
This is about a tiny market.
You've gotta refute it.
You've gotta tell me
why I'm wrong.
Oh, you're absolutely wrong.
This is not a tiny market.
Well, tell me why.
This--This is a market
that--That's been around
for 20 years.
It's gonna be around
for 20 more years.
You're, like, you know,
where were we at 20 years ago?
That's probably
my best compliment I could get.
See, I disagree with--
With the undertaker here.
I know.
You know,
he's the undertaker
'cause he's where
businesses go to die.
(laughs)
Boy, isn't that True?
This one's already dead.
It doesn't have to visit me.
No, it--
cause he's...
(laughs)
It's just starting to grow.
I-I don't disagree with you
that I see a market there,
because, look, if you're
the only player,
you don't have--It doesn't have
to be a huge market, right?
You can dominate a niche.
But the problem, Jim,
is that you haven't
been dominating.
You know, you've got the--
Well--
You've got what appears to be
a great product, you know,
but something's missing.
You're telling us
these numbers.
You're telling us
there's a market there,
even if the undertaker doesn't
fully understand it.
(chuckles)
The undertaker speaks
the truth.
That's the problem.
Tell me why I'm wrong, Jim.
But--No.
You're speaking the truth
of what you know.
You--There--
there's still additional--
All I know is
you're not selling anything.
Well, we're not selling
because we don't have
a sales force that's
going out there to sell.
That's the reason?
We--we have you,
the buyers, coming to us,
saying,
"we like the product."
Jim, you keep on Digging B--
Deeper holes, right?
Yeah.
If I had my life savings,
everything,
on the line in a business,
which I've had before,
where if I don't sell,
I don't eat--
And trust me, I lived off of
mustard and ketchup sandwiches,
and that's no lie, okay?
If that was me, if I saw
a truck in the driveway,
I'd be knocking
on the door, selling,
and I would be able to go
door-to-Door
and sell
more than 1,700 units.
Sales cures all.
You've gotta get off your ass
and get out there and sell.
It's not our money
that's gonna change it.
It's your effort...
(Kevin) It's you.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
You know, you're
the number one mattress.
and yet you can't sell it,
and I personally think
it's a tiny niche market,
'cause you're not able
to convince me otherwise.
I have zero interest in
investing with you, my friend.
I'm out.
Jim...
you're not selling.
You're putting it on shelves,
and you're not selling
directly to the consumer.
Uh, it could be
a great product,
but you haven't proved
that today.
I'm out.
(mouths words)
You know, I-I chose to take
this market slow.
I wanted to test out
my product.
I wanted to get
into the niche markets.
We just need to get it into--
to--to more of the masses.
It sounds like you're still
at the testing stage...
not at all. No.
And I can't afford for you
to test with my money,
so I'm out.
Jim, four sharks are out.
You got one shot left--Barbara.
I just love the product.
There's a lot of guys
with trucks out there,
but I have a couple
of detail questions
that are
enormously important.
One, do you have a patent
on the mattress
or the blowup device?
I have a--I have four patents
on the mattress.
(sighs)
What bothers me most about
your pitch today--
And This is why
I'm sitting on the fence--
You're not a salesman.
You can't sell.
What are you going to do
to convince me
to put my money in?
This is your one shot.
Everybody else is out.
I want to hear how
you're gonna convince me.
Well, we're gonna jump
right into--
Both feet--
the 3,500 existing contacts
we have
of--of all of the--
Kinda--It would be like
the, uh, grassroots effect.
So the list of 3,500 people
who said they were
sort of interested--
You're gonna suddenly now go
home and start calling them?
Well, we're bringing people
in to do that.
I'm doing it as well,
but b--Running
the day-to-day business,
it's kinda hard to go str--
Directly into, you know,
more than 10 or--Or 15
SALES Calls per day,
where if we're hitting
50 SALES Calls per day,
now you're--
You're increasing--
That's just such an--Uh, sorry,
but that's just such an excuse.
Sales is the lifeblood
of your business.
The only thing you should
be doing right now
is selling this stuff.
I mean, I-I'm out,
but I gotta tell ya,
I hate when people say
stuff like that.
Are you gonna send money
to die here, Barbara?
What are you doing?
Because I can see
you're not a businessman.
Wait. Jim. Jim, let me--
Let me recast her offer.
I--
Yeah.
I get it.
I get it, all right, man?
You really do get it?
I don't think
you fully get it.
(Robert) Well, if--
she's saying,
"I'm gonna come work
for you full-Time,"
because you can't sell
but she can,
That's a no-Brainer.
Mm.
But it's not.
It--the--the sales are
where they're at,
uh, you know?
But you don't have them.
It--It's--
are you declining
her offer?
I'll counter you
an offer back...
that's fair.
If you'll accept that.
What do you have?
Um, my counteroffer That
would be back would be 25%.
(daymond laughs)
That's what you get, Barb.
I'm gonna give you...
you know, it's--
a moment to rethink that.
Yeah. No.
My--My decision's final.
That's your final decision?
It's 25%.
Well, good luck. I'm out.
Thank you.
He's a fool. He's a fool.
I could sell hundreds
of thousands of these.
That guy made a huge mistake,
but I have a great feeling
of relief that you didn't
kill that money.
I appreciated the offer
from Barbara for $250,000,
but 50% of the company was
just something
I wasn't willing to give up.
