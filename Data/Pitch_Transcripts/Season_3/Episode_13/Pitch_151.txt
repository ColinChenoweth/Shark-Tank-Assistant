My name's Scotty Olson.
Scotty, are you nuts?
(Robert chuckles)
Uh, I've been told that
many times over the years.
I've been, um, inventing
innovating products.
That's a passion of mine.
Have you invented anything
in the past that we would know?
My claim to fame is
the rollerblade inventor.
I started the company
25 years ago,
Scotty, you invented
rollerblades?
I-I did. I did.
I'm the--I'm the--that's
my claim to fame,
Come on. Come on, Scotty.
You can--
You know what?
You never forg--
Scotty...
it's like your first date.
Has anybody ever--
I had a--I had a shark
come in...
Scotty, did you actually bring
rollerblades to the market,
on a stationary bike?
Scotty, you're asking families
to take up their whole backyard
with infrastructure--
Posts, cement...
okay, but that's--
(Barbara) Scott.
That's a--that's just
a part of it.
Time out.
I so respect you
for this enormous dream
you have,
but I just don't think
it's going to happen,
Scotty, my sense of you--
and I-I want you to take this
in a positive light--
is you're the inventor/idea guy.
You're not an executional guy,
in terms of doing any
of this stuff.
But my problem, Scotty, is
that it's gonna take a lot
of construction management
expertise.
I agree.
That's not--That's not me.
I don't have any expertise
there at all,
Scotty, I-I love things
that make you go fast,
but I don't see the large-Scale
consumer application for it.
No, uh, we--That--That's not
our main focus in the backyard.
It's certainly
the ski resorts.
Scotty, it's
an admirable goal,
but I can't fly with you
on this.
I'm out.
Okay, I'm the only guy left,
Scotty, and here's what I say.
I wish every investment I made
made money, But they don't.
Some fail.
You should think about
your ideas the same way.
This is a dog from hell.
This is a very bad idea.
