My name is Billy Blanks jr.
I'm from los Angeles,
and I've created a program
that revolutionizes
the fitness industry.
5, 6, 7...
(woman) Here we go!
Here we go. Slide.
Slide.
Slide.
It's a fitness program
that makes fitness fun
for people of all ages,
shapes, and sizes.
When my wife and I
created the program,
we were homeless.
This is the motel
that we actually stayed at.
When we lost our home.
Being here motivated me to go,
"I-I gotta get outta this."
My wife and I
have risked everything
to make this program
come to life.
Right, left. Front, back.
To the right.
Right.
Left.
Front, back. Come on.
Left.
I want to prove that I can make
a name for myself on my own.
I've had a lot of hurdles
in life.
To the right side.
Walk 1...
I know that we have
a great idea,
and I need the sharks to help me
bring this idea to the world.
Hi, sharks. My name
is Billy Blanks jr.
And I'm the creator of
"Billy Blanks Jr.'s
dance with me."
I'm here today asking
for $100,000 investment
for a 20% stake in my company.
You know, I grew up
in a fitness family.
My father is Billy Blanks,
the creator of "Tae bo"
And the biggest fitness selling
dvd in history.
But growing up
in a fitness family,
I always felt like it was
a little too serious, you know?
Uh, the boot camp thing--
I wasn't about
screaming in people's face.
I-I danced my whole life
on Broadway,
and I always felt, well,
dancing keeps me in shape.
I have a great time dancing.
Why can't it be fun?
"Billy Blanks Jr.'s
dance with me"
is an all-Inclusive workout
for people of all ages,
shapes, and sizes.
It includes
all styles of dance,
from hip-Hop to bollywood
to line dancing,
to the tango,
to hula dancing, african.
You name it, we do it.
So I want to show you guys what
dance with me is all about,
all right?
I brought my wife and my, uh,
codirector of this program,
Sharon Catherine Blanks,
and I got some students here.
Now I want you guys to dance
in your seats a little bit
if you can, all right?
Just move with us.
Arms. Yeah.
Like that, Barbara.
I like that.
Come on, Mr. Wonderful.
(laughs)
Just groove with us,
all right?
So the first step,
we're gonna start off
with a little bit of hip-Hop
rowing like this.
Row it out. Come on. Unh!
Now if you're at home,
I want you to get up and dance
with us, too, all right?
Come on. Row it. Yeah.
So this is the row.
We're gonna go hip-Hop style.
Now we're gonna move on
to the next one.
We're gonna go shoulder,
shoulder, down, whassup?
Shoulder, shoulder, down.
Whassup?
(sharks laughing)
Come on, y'all.
Come on.
Shoulder, shoulder, down.
Come on, daymond.
Whassup?
Now double time. Here we go.
Shoulder, shoulder, down.
Whassup?
Whassup?
Shoulder, shoulder, down.
Come on. Yes. We're gonna move
on to a little bit of disco.
I know Mr. Mark cuban
used to teach disco.
Yeah.
Right? Come on. Come on.
Oh, lord.
Come on. Down here.
Get out there.
Cheer him on, y'all.
Right here.
Whoo! Yes, yes.
Where do you want me?
Go, mark. Go, mark.
Right here. Come on.
I gotta be able to see you.
(Barbara) Go, mark.
Go, mark. Go, mark.
Come on. Come on.
Look at that, huh?
(laughs)
Yeah, give it up for him.
There you go, baby. (laughs)
(music stops)
Thank you, guys.
(mark) Wow.
That's it? Aw.
I think I lost 20 pounds.
(Barbara laughs)
(Robert)
Well, that was fun.
High energy. Whoo.
Thank you very much.
So you know
from the "tae bo" Experience
that it's very expensive
to launch
a product into the market.
I'm assuming that's why you're
here for the $100,000, right?
Actually, I'm here
for my instructor
certification program.
I have dvds--Two dvds
out right now.
They're at all the walmarts,
targets,
best buy,
and with lionsgate.
I have just signed a contract
with them for four more dvds
to come out
in the next two years.
Okay, so let--Let's get
some clarification here.
Those are
your consumer products.
And now you're looking
to create
an INSTRUCTOR certification
program?
So these are two separate
businesses then, right?
It's two separate businesses.
What it is is,
uh, you know, I have--Peop--
The e-mails that I'm getting
are people going, "I've been
working out to the dvds.
Now how do I do
the live class?"
what I'm trying to do
is train the teachers
to teach the workout
so somebody
can do it in New York,
somebody can do it in l.A.
So tell us about
the business model there.
What happens is,
the instructor will come.
They pay 250 bucks.
Uh, they take
the 2-Day course.
And then from there, they're
certified for one year.
But, Billy, how do you scale it?
How do you make it go wide?
When we go to each city,
we select ten master trainers,
that when we leave, they
continue to host certifications.
My goal is to have
a person in every city
by This time next year.
And what's the revenue
of the combined business?
Uh, right now, I don't know.
They just released--
The dvds just released.
You're asking us to invest
in this--
call it
the wholesale business, right?
Mm-hmm.
But you're not giving us
any part of the retail business.
See, if I give you $100,000,
I want you to work your ass off,
you know,
every minute of every day,
so we both get a return
on our investment.
(Robert) Billy, look, for me,
mark hit the nail on the head.
I think the brand is you.
You build one,
you build the other.
They've gotta be combined.
Can you combine it?
Yeah, I would combine 'em.
I would combine 'em, 'cause
to me, it's that important.
If you guys believe in me,
I'm not sitting here
trying to keep everything
in my pocket.
Billy, can you tell me more
about "Tae bo" With your dad?
I was not familiar
with that at all.
Yeah, "Tae Bo," uh, was
something my dad created
that was a karate-Kickboxing
workout.
It's the highest selling
fitness dvd in history.
Did he invest
in your business?
If it's such a big brand,
he should be the biggest
believer in the world.
Very good question.
Uh, you know...
some family structures
are different.
Family structures where
the parents make money
and the parents share
that wealth with their family.
Then there--
So he's a cheapskate?
(laughs) That's--
Well, I would--
or he's making you earn it.
He's making me earn it.
(Barbara)
So without his backup,
how have you made that work
by yourself?
Uh, well, my wife, who was
dancing here with me today,
uh, she's been
a support system.
And also, you know, for me,
you know, when we built
this workout,
my wife and I were homeless.
You were homeless?
Yes.
Did your dad know
you were homeless?
Yes.
I mean, are you estranged
from your Dad?
Uh--
not to ask you
a personal question.
You're not that close to him
is what you're saying.
Not that close,
But now things have seemed
to change a little bit
in a better direction.
(laughs)
Do you have the rights
to use the name Billy Blank jr.
In all manners?
Your dad's not gonna
come out of the woodwork
and say, "look, I'm Billy
Blanks. Forget the junior part."
(laughs)
seriously.
No, I know what you're saying.
It's--It's a legit
legal question, right?
It--it hasn't been an issue.
He knows about this contract.
We have the same agent.
Uh, so it hasn't been
an issue thus far.
Billy, let me, uh, tell you
how I feel.
I think it's great you take
total responsibility
for yourself,
independent of your Dad.
When you get there, it's gonna
feel So much better.
Thank you, Barbara.
And I think you know that.
As a business,
it's not clear to me.
So I'm out.
(mouths word)
(Robert) Billy, look,
I have such respect
for your story,
trying to come out of
the shadow of your Dad.
Thank you.
But as
a value business partner...
Mm-hmm.
You know, I'm not your guy.
I'm out.
All right.
I think you're a great guy,
Billy.
I admire all
the stick-to-Itiveness.
That's good.
But it's not
an investment for me.
I'm out.
(daymond) the beauty
of coming into the tank
is we all are experts
in different areas.
I have a very tight,
strategic relationship
with zumba.
12 million people
do it a week.
And maybe This is
an asset to them.
I would offer...
if mark is willing
to come in with me,
$100,000 for 50%,
contingent on
Billy Blanks name
and zumba's approval
and willing to work with you.
That way, you can get to
12 million people immediately,
"the Billy Blanks jr.
Dance with me"
Through their distribution?
Life is always about
distribution. That's it.
See, I just feel that
I've worked so hard
to create something
that is different.
It's completely different.
(mark)
what he's saying is,
this is a way to
accelerate you very quickly.
Now Billy Blanks jr.
Is making the circuit
through all the zumba classes
and doing the training.
And if we can make it work,
that's a contingency,
you'll get $100,000,
plus 50% of whatever
we're able to sell zumba on.
That's a hell of a deal.
(Robert) Billy,
what's your concern?
I mean, they're taking you
to 12 million people.
I'm thinking you should
be jumping--
It's just because there's--
right now with--
You know, literally,
there are people who go,
"This is the workout
they do with them,"
and--And for me
and my opinion of--
It's a little dis--
Okay, Billy,
I see you're having
a challenge with this.
And what I'm gonna say
is that--
Can I talk to my wife
Real Quick about it?
Sure.
She's here to talk to me.
Yes, because I was
a--I'm about to exit.
So please talk to your wife.
(Robert) talk to your wife.
(Billy) All right.
I don't think he got it.
I don't think
he got it either.
We have one offer
and it's from mark cuban
and from daymond.
I want to ask you about it.
Okay.
Daymond works closely
with zumba.
Okay.
And so they want 50%,
they'll do the $100,000,
But they want to go to zumba
and see if we can be
an extension of their brand.
They said it--they said
they don't understand
why we won't do it
because it brings us
to 12 million--
12 million people,
an audience.
You know we're trying
to separate our brands, so...
but they're saying, you know,
this is a smart deal.
50% of the company.
This--This is difficult,
because you're the brand.
Daymond, why wouldn't zumba just
create their own dance program?
They might. They may say,
"daymond, beat it."
But they don't have the--
him as a brand,
and he does have
brand value.
I love you, sweetheart.
All right.
Love you, too.
All right.
See you.
Okay.
It is your brand.
I don't think you get this.
Yeah, Billy, I--
No, I understand that,
but I'm saying,
it's still coming through,
it's--It's building their brand.
No, no, no.
No, it's not building
their brand.
Billy, okay at this point
I'm gonna--
(Billy speaks indistinctly)
at this point,
I'm gonna ask you to trust us.
We're taking you in
to somebody who could
accelerate your brand...
Mm-hmm.
And help you get it in front
of more people
far more quickly than you could
on your--on your own.
We're gonna let you look at it
and say yes or no.
I understand. I just want to be
in the position zumba's in.
I want to be
in that position--
I'm trying to get you there.
(Barbara)
Billy, think of them,
think of zumba
as a delivery boy.
With these two guys?
I would. Yes, I would.
(daymond) Billy, Billy, Billy.
Billy.
What are you gonna do?
All right. We wish you
the best, Billy.
Good luck.
Thank you, guys, so much
for having me. Really.
(mark) go get 'em. Seriously.
(Barbara) Good luck to you.
Thank you, guys,
so much.
(Barbara) wow.
I don't think
he quite got it, though.
That's a mistake.
I-I-I'm--I wanna help him
for himself now.
He's killing himself.
Anyways, I'm sending you both
an invoice
for my time on that one.
(Barbara laughs)
Next.
You know what?
If I don't do this,
I'm gonna regret it.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna do the deal.
(laughs)
(woman) Listen...
You know, and I--and I...
guys.
Daymond...
(chuckles)
Sharon?
Sharon Catherine.
How are you?
Why don't we sit down
for a second?
Okay.
Sweetheart.
I've never done this before.
I think that
you don't understand
the opportunity
that we gave you.
Let me explain it
to your wife.
We are offering,
in regards to if zumba
will accept,
if they want to take
"Billy Blanks jr.
Dance with me" program
and distribute it
in their pipeline.
Not making it
a zumba product.
It's exactly like
if you went to walmart
and they said, "We're gonna
put you on this shelf."
You're not pushing walmart.
And if you didn't like
the deal,
then we don't do the deal.
And you're back
to where you are now.
You understand
what I'm saying to you?
I under--I understand.
So this is what I'm trying
to explain to you.
You walked away from
a valuable deal like that,
but a lot of times,
the only thing that is
more important than the number
is the person.
Mm-hmm.
You understand?
I understand.
I wouldn't do that to you
and your lovely wife.
I understand.
Can you reconsider
the deal?
Because you make me
want to help you.
(voice breaking) You don't
realize what this means to us,
that you're coming to us
and taking that extra step.
It means a lot
to me as well.
(crying)
And I-I will definitely
take that deal.
Don't make me cry.
I'm sorry, but I will definitely
take that deal because...
Do not make me cry.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
God bless you.
I will do the best
for you
that I possibly can.
I promise you that.
All right?
(both) Thank you.
I truly appreciate that.
I'm gettin' my sweat
on you. Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Bye, guys. Thank you.
Tell them thank you.
All right. Will do.
Thank you.
(Sharon Catherine
sniffles)
(cries)
I'm kinda overwhelmed
right now because it's--
I just feel like
it's the road to what we've been
fighting for, my wife and I.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so grateful,
because I know
there are times in life
where people don't get
second chances.
So I'm grateful for that,
and I just think it's gonna be
a great deal.
