Hi, sharks. My name
is Billy Blanks jr.
"Billy Blanks Jr.'s
dance with me."
I'm here today asking
for $100,000 investment
for a 20% stake in my company.
You know, I grew up
in a fitness family.
My father is Billy Blanks,
the creator of "Tae bo"
"Billy Blanks Jr.'s
dance with me"
is an all-Inclusive workout
codirector of this program,
Sharon Catherine Blanks,
But, Billy, how do you scale it?
How do you make it go wide?
When we go to each city,
we select ten master trainers,
that when we leave, they
continue to host certifications.
My goal is to have
a person in every city
by This time next year.
(Robert) Billy, look, for me,
mark hit the nail on the head.
Billy, can you tell me more
about "Tae bo" With your dad?
I was not familiar
with that at all.
Yeah, "Tae Bo," uh, was
something my dad created
that was a karate-Kickboxing
workout.
It's the highest selling
fitness dvd in history.
Did he invest
in your business?
Do you have the rights
to use the name Billy Blank jr.
In all manners?
Your dad's not gonna
come out of the woodwork
Billy, let me, uh, tell you
how I feel.
I think it's great you take
total responsibility
for yourself,
independent of your Dad.
When you get there, it's gonna
feel So much better.
(Robert) Billy, look,
I have such respect
for your story,
trying to come out of
the shadow of your Dad.
Thank you.
But as
a value business partner...
Mm-hmm.
You know, I'm not your guy.
I'm out.
All right.
I think you're a great guy,
Billy.
I admire all
the stick-to-Itiveness.
That's good.
But it's not
an investment for me.
I'm out.
(daymond) the beauty
of coming into the tank
is we all are experts
in different areas.
I have a very tight,
strategic relationship
with zumba.
12 million people
do it a week.
contingent on
Billy Blanks name
"the Billy Blanks jr.
Dance with me"
Through their distribution?
Life is always about
distribution. That's it.
See, I just feel that
I've worked so hard
to create something
that is different.
It's completely different.
(mark)
what he's saying is,
this is a way to
accelerate you very quickly.
Now Billy Blanks jr.
Is making the circuit
(Robert) Billy,
what's your concern?
I mean, they're taking you
to 12 million people.
I'm thinking you should
be jumping--
It's just because there's--
right now with--
You know, literally,
there are people who go,
"This is the workout
they do with them,"
It's a little dis--
Okay, Billy,
I see you're having
a challenge with this.
(Billy) All right.
I don't think he got it.
I don't think
he got it either.
We have one offer
Billy, okay at this point
I'm gonna--

for himself now.
He's killing himself.
Anyways, I'm sending you both
an invoice
for my time on that one.
