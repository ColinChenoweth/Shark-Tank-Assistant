Hi, I'm Keeley.
And I'm Erika.
We founded our company
wild squirrel nut butter
This January as sophomores
at the university of oregon.
Wild squirrel is seeking
a $50,000 investment
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Keeley and I
<i>love</i>peanut butter.
In fact,
we love peanut Butter So much
that one rainy Friday afternoon
in our college apartment,
Since Erika and I both really
enjoyed creating recipes,
we started adding
New Ingredients
from around our house.
We soon had come up
with four exciting flavors
and<i>way</i>more peanut butter
than we knew what to do with.
So we started passing it out
to our friends around campus.
Today we wanted you all to have
the same opportunity.
Any one?
Yep.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you, Erika.
You're welcome.
(Keeley) So we have
four flavors.
We have sneaky cinnamon,
which is our cinnamon raisin,
bright eyed &amp; bushy tailed,
which is our chocolate espresso
peanut butter,
curious cocoa-Nut, which is our
chocolate coconut peanut butter,
and we have pretzel pizzaz,
our honey pretzel peanut butter.
It's good.
(Barbara) Wow.
It's very good.
The pretzel's great.
That's awesome.
That cinnamon's great.
The, uh, the pretzel
is fantastic.
(woman) Good.
(daymond) Very good.
Try the cinnamon.
To date, we have sold thousands
of jars of our peanut butter
on our web site,
at farmers' markets,
and at campus street fairs.
In the next month,
we'll be on shelves
at grocery stores
throughout oregon.
And we're confident
that with the right funding,
wild squirrel Peanut butter
can become a national brand.
So you sold thousands...
in what time period
and how many?
We have been selling
since february,
and we've sold 3,500 jars.
How many dollars
have you sold?
We have, uh, gross--$14,000
and profited $7,000.
What's the peanut butter
sell for?
We make them for $3 and sell
them to the stores for $4.
And they retail for $5.99.
So you only make $1 of profit
per--Per jar?
Right now. Since we're just
beginning, we haven't found
the perfect sourcing
for all of our products yet.
Tell me about you guys first
before we get too far
into the details.
What year in school--You said
you're sophomores still or--
We're about to be juniors.
You're about to be juniors.
At the university
of oregon.
What are you majoring in?
I am an environmental studies
and spanish major.
I'm journalism and art.
So we kind of fell into this.
We call it our honorary
business major. (laughs)
What kind of help have you
gotten from the outside
and do you 2 each own 50%,
or who else is involved?
Right now, we each own 50%.
My parents have backed us
for $50,000.
Why do you need our $50,000?
They're little
peanut butter monsters.
We need $50,000
because the $50,000
we're getting from her parents
will only cover
the first run.
Ladies, just a quick question
about your business model,
because we're selling them
for $4 a unit.
The cost to make them is $3.
The profit's only $1.
You have to reverse that.
You have to make it for $1
and make $3.
Well, the bigger the run
we do with the co-Packer,
the less it costs
per jar.
How big does it have to be
that I could make $3
on every one that you sell
instead of $1?
We can cut--I-I'm confident
we could cut our cost
by $1 a jar.
By $1 to $2.
No. I want you to cut
your cost by $3.
We c--I'm--I'm sure
we could do it.
I'm confident
we could do it.
(Barbara) Meanwhile,
how are you balancing that?
How do you remain a student,
an inventor, a businessperson,
and do it all at once?
We--
Well, the great thing about
being in college
is we have so many resources.
We have an incredible
entrepreneurship program
that's helped us a lot.
So far
college has helped us.
What I'm concerned with is,
is who's gonna run it?
I mean, there are--There are
very successful people--
Bill gates, Steve jobs--
Who quit university because they
started their business
and said, "Hey, this is better.
I'm learning more running this
business than I am at school."
And we've said that
a million times.
And I think we're going
to fall term classes,
and we're gonna feel it out
and see what's happening.
So, Keeley and Erika,
so great peanut butter.
Thank you. (laughs)
I love your energy.
But, you know, being new
to this space,
I can't learn this business
with you.
I need my money to work for me
and not me working for my money.
Okay.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
So, ladies,
let's get down to business.
(laughs)
Um, you've said that
you will
sell me 10% of this company
for $50,000.
So you're valuing
the company today
at half a million dollars.
Do you see any problem
with that?
Nope.
Our value's in future sales,
not in present sales.
But you want me to pay
for the future now.
Right. That's what
you have to do. (laughs)
(Robert) Look, it--
Here's the difference between
going to school
and the real world.
In the real world,
when you fail,
you don't get a bad grade
from your professor
and go to another class
the next day.
You lose money.
Somebody needs to
do this full-Time,
otherwise it's a Hobby.
N-N-No,
no, Keeley.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
Life doesn't work that way.
You don't get in life
what you deserve.
You get in life
what you make of it.
Valuing your company
because you're good people,
you deserve it, is almost
like expecting a Bull
not to attack you
'cause you're a vegetarian.
(laughter)
Yes, we understand.
It's not gonna work.
(Robert) It's focus,
it's dedication,
it's all that stuff, and I think
you're gonna get there.
But you're not there yet.
For that reason...
uh, I'm out.
Barbara. (laughs)
(chuckles)
(Kevin) Barbara,
please, before you start,
that little squirrel
is going to be a rodent
with rabies to you...
(laughs)
If you give these girls
$50,000.
Who's saying
I'm giving them money?
All right.
Mind your business.
You're out.
You know, I could argue
either side, I have to tell you.
'cause I own now
three businesses
as a result of "Shark tank"
in the food area.
Mm-hmm.
So I've had--
I've had very good success,
but you know
what has surprised me?
The amount of money that it has
taken to make a success of that,
and it sure was a Heck of a lot
more than $50,000.
So I think it's foolish
that you come in here
and ask for $50,000
just to take care
of the next stage,
and that worries me.
You know what?
(Kevin speaks indistinctly)
I'll give you an offer,
but I hope I don't regret it.
I'm counting on you.
But bear in mind,
when I give it to you,
it's with an EYE toward really
knowing what's gonna be needed
down the road--
Six months out,
a year out--
When you have a huge success.
My Daisy Cake Business
went from
$10,000 a year
to $150,000 a month.
Okay.
That's a lot of product
to fund.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
So I'm gonna give you an offer
of your $50,000
for 40%.
You want to think about that?
35%. We'd be happy
with 35%.
35% is not enough.
(Keeley)
She has so much expertise
and she's gonna really take
our business to the next level
and we're just--
We're thrilled right now.
We're out--
Psyched out of our mind.
