Hi, I'm Keeley.
Thank you, Erika.
You're welcome.
(Keeley) So we have
four flavors.
We have sneaky cinnamon,
which is our cinnamon raisin,
bright eyed &amp; bushy tailed,
which is our chocolate espresso
peanut butter,
curious cocoa-Nut, which is our
chocolate coconut peanut butter,
N-N-No,
no, Keeley.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
Life doesn't work that way.
You don't get in life
what you deserve.
You get in life
what you make of it.
Valuing your company
because you're good people,
you deserve it, is almost
like expecting a Bull
not to attack you
'cause you're a vegetarian.
(laughter)
(Keeley)
She has so much expertise
and she's gonna really take
our business to the next level
