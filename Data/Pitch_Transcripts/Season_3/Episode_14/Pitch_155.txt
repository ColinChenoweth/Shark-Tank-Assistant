Hello, my name is Frank.
And I'm Adam.
The name of our business
is mix bikini,
and we are seeking $50,000
in exchange for 5%
of our business.
It's no secret
women love to stand out.
But there is nothing worse
for a woman
than being at the beach
and seeing another girl
in the same bikini,
and that's the reason
we created mix bikini.
(Kevin) Frank, Frank,
I wanna make a point to you
that if you've seen other,
um, entrepreneurs here
in the shark tank
walk out with money,
the only guys that ever,
ever get any money
are able to articulate
in 90 seconds,
here's how<i>I</i>get rich.
That's all I care about.
This is how you get rich,
because this is gonna--
Now you're doing it?
Yeah, now I'm doing it.
You want me to do
your presentation for you?
Now I'm doing it.
Every girl that has ever
worn, seen,
touched this bikini
has loved it and wants it.
This bikini is gonna be
the next hottest trend,
and it's a $10-Billion-a-year
industry.
1/10 of 1% will make you more
money than you already have.
Frank, Frank, you talk
so much smack, right?
When you walked in the door,
it was, you know, "kiosk."
$50,000 is not
gonna build a kiosk.
It's not gonna program
the software.
It's not gonna get
all the pieces together.
But we have money.
Okay? We don't have
the expertise.
(Robert) What do you mean,
you have money?
You guys
are asking about money.
We have some money.
How much money do you have
to put into this?
We have as much as $500,000.
So then why are you here?
(Robert) Yeah.
I'm here because,
like you said, daymond,
we need your expertise.
Mark, we need
your publicity that--
that you're so great at doing.
I mean,
your online capabilities.
Barbara, your woman's touch.
I mean, I read a book one time
that said you can either
hang around with chickens
or you can soar with eagles.
We don't want to be
your eagle.
We want to help you
be eagles, right?
And I'm telling you how
we're gonna do it.
And you're not there.
This is
how we're gonna do that.
We're gonna either license this
to a major brand,
we're gonna license it
to more than one major brand,
we're gonna partner up
with an existing brand,
or we can build a brand.
It is not that easy.
Trust me.
If it was, I would be
all over it.
I'm out.
I like to take money--
I've always said,
they're little soldiers.
I like them to send them out
into battle,
take prisoners, come home.
Look, I don't care
if I do it with bikinis
or dog food.
I couldn't care less.
I just want more money.
And I don't understand
with working with you...
(Frank) You--
How I would get there.
You are gonna make more money
because This is the hottest
concept in swimwear.
There's nothing like it
on the market.
All it needs is a little match
to light...
it may be,
but you don't have a--
the gasoline.
It's gonna blow up.
I'm a dreamer like everybody
here was a dreamer,
and I'm going after my dream.
(Robert) Hey,
there's nothing wrong--
Daymond was a dreamer.
You were a dreamer.
There's nothing wrong with--
We were all dreamers--
Barbara--But you know what?
There's nothing wrong
with being a dreamer.
Good. Exactly.
You came out here. You didn't
give us any numbers.
Barbara, you haven't--
You've been pretty quiet.
You haven't said much.
I'd like to hear
a woman's perspective.
What disturbs me is,
you have
so many moving parts
in the product itself.
I can't imagine it
in a retail environment,
'cause I think you actually
have to demonstrate
how you do the darn thing.
But I'll tell you something.
I think this is a business
that could do well.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
