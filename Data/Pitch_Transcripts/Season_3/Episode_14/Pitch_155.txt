as we were scraping the bottom
of yet another jar
of generic peanut butter,
we realized that we had
a brand-New food processor
and a bag of peanuts.
So it wasn't long
before we had created
our first batch
of homemade peanut butter.
So who is gonna do it
full-Time tomorrow
if I give you my money?
We believe that
with both of us working,
that equates to one person.
We are--
(mark) That doesn't count, guys.
That doesn't count.
Because there's somebody
out there competing with you
that's trying to kick your ass,
and they're not going--
They're not going to class
saying "Two equals one."
And because I know that
it's gonna be
a huge amount of work,
I have to say, I'm out.
We are determined
to succeed.
We are both
extremely hard workers.
We are dedicated.
We put our time into things
and we make--
We wake up at 5:00
every morning--
We see the results.
I believe you're motivated,
but I think what everybody sees
as a major fault is,
in the competitive world
of peanut butter,
there are teams like you that
get up at 5:00 in the morning
and work till 10:00 at night
to keep that shelf space
and to grow it.
Look, girls, this--
Or 12 hours...
(Robert) 10 hours a day?
What is it, a vacation?
Or 20 hours a day.
20.
This--This is--
We can still
spend that time.
Yeah, but wait a second.
This is the cold reality
of business.
When I see you again,
you're gonna be a lot older.
I know that because
the world is gonna kick
the living crap out of you.
(laughs)
Don't listen to--
and that is not a bad thing.
That is not a bad thing.
I know the world of hurt
you're gonna go into
when you start retailing
peanut butter.
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Hi, my name's Tom Callahan.
I represent cab 20,
the brainchild of 18-year-Old
music prodigy Bert Hoover.
Uh, we're seeking an investment
of $200,000
for a 20% equity position
in this band.
When I first met this band
about six months ago,
I saw this huge potential
and was impressed
by their talent.
Cab 20 has that "it,"
if you will.
So I'd like to present to you
the band cab 20.
(playing "Stomp")
? I've been waitin'
for a while now ?
? to hear your name ?
? you set your heart
and you set your soul ?
? the feeling still remains ?
? she said,
I don't need no notion ?
? I will disappear ?
? won't be gone
for too long ?
? but I'm gettin' outta here ?
? tonight ?
? what if her love ?
? burns like the sun? ?
? You don't got none
unless you got some ?
? of her ?
(cheering)
Good job, guys.
Yeah.
Outstanding.
Wow.
So tell us about
what's included.
What do we get?
Primarily publishing,
merchandising, and touring.
Right.
And there's also, of course
record sales, digital downloads.
There's
tv/film placement.
There's lots of things,
but this, uh, ask
is excluding the publishing.
Oh.
Oh.
See, that was gonna be
my question--Is this a 360 deal?
Well, most of 360 deals
actually don't include
the publishing.
It's usually
an--An added negotiation.
(Robert) Tom, explain to me
how the deal works.
I'm not as familiar
as these guys.
(mark) Yeah, let me.
You--
Robert, what basically--
360 means
it covers everything.
So your touring,
your music sales.
So what he's saying, it includes
all their revenues
except for publishing,
which is the, um,
any revenue received
because they've written songs.
(Kevin) I mean, come on.
Publishing's what this
is all about.
If these guys are huge
20 years from now,
I want the revenue stream.
I want to wet my beak
in that, too.
Unless you want to throw
some more money in the pot,
and we can talk about that,
but... (chuckles)
So, Bert, who would you be
most comparable to today?
We always get comparisons
to, like, the black keys,
white stripes.
Love white Stripes.
What do you bring
to the table?
I've worked in So many
different capacities
over the 25 years--
Major label, consulting,
promotion and marketing--
Everybody from Lenny kravitz
to shania twain. Um...
you managed Lenny kravitz?
No, this is promotion
and marketing areas, yes.
Is this
your first entire band
that you're gonna spearhead
from conception
all the way through?
Yes.
But we're investing as much
in you as we are the band.
Yeah,
I would think so.
(Kevin) the percentage of bands
that break out
and make a lot of money
for their investors is,
as you know,
very, very small.
(mark)
Look, the music business
is the worst business
on the planet.
It scares
the hell outta me.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
(daymond) I did a deal
with universal Music
about eight years ago,
and by the time I was done
investing in that music,
I was out of $6 million
for one album.
Good thing is, I ended up having
a song called "Fatty girl,"
and I made $100 million
off the clothes,
But if it wasn't for that,
I would've been demolished.
Well, the--the--
Well, as I was saying,
(daymond speaks indistinctly)
the publishing is where
you make the money...
one--One second.
The touring is where
you make the money.
One second.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
You know, I have to say, I love
your little package here.
I like Bert.
He looks like a virgin.
And the girls are gonna
go nuts for him.
Then you got your--
(Kevin) Wow.
You got a groupie.
Then you got your John Lennon
lookalike guy.
And then you got a guy
who needs a bath.
Now the three together--
Slash. It's slash.
It's not--Yeah.
(Kevin, daymond,
and Robert laughing)
So I like it, you know.
It feels real to me.
But, you know,
you don't feel to me,
in my bones, like a guy
that could hustle,
break through doors.
I want to<i>feel you</i>coming
at me,
and I don't get that.
So even if I loved the band,
I wouldn't buy into you.
I'm out.
Fair enough.
she switches out her left top
and her back bottom.
Giving her a whole new look.
And there is nothing like
mix bikini on the market.
So we ask you,
which one of you sharks
wanna swim with mix bikini?
How many have you sold?
Um, we haven't sold that many.
We--We're just launched,
a soft launch.
So your sales are zero?
Not zero, But, uh,
very minimal.
By the way, you didn't say
what that sells for.
Do you mind my asking
what it sells for?
So every part retails
for $9.99.
The entire bikini
would cost ya,
depending on
which one you made,
between $40 and $50 to create,
which is very reasonable.
And is your intention
to sell it online period?
No, no.
We'd like to open up a kiosk
so that when girls
walk through a mall,
they can really get to touch
and play and feel
and design it--
and what's the cost
of one kiosk?
The cost of actually
building the kiosk
would cost us about $25,000
to build the freestanding kiosk.
Negotiating the rent, that's
a--that's a whole nother story.
We didn't ask about
a bigger topic here.
You're asking $50,000 for 5%.
That means that you're saying
the company
is valued at $1 million.
Yes.
It was 10%
we were asking.
I'm sorry $50,000
for 10%?
Correct.
So half a million dollars.
No. You know, you asked
for $50,000 for 5%.
You guys
talk to each other?
(Robert)
Yeah, which one is it?
It's 10%, $50,000.
(daymond) Okay,
so half a million dollars
you're saying your company
is worth at this moment,
and you haven't made
not one sale.
(Kevin) I'm just trying
to understand
what the business model is.
Don't you just want
to license this to people?
Maybe I do want to license
it to somebody. I'm not sure.
There are so many ways
we can go with this.
Well, pick one.
We don't know. We're here.
We're--We're--We're open
to suggestions.
(mark) When you come into
the shark tank,
you have to have a business.
We can offer capital,
we can offer guidance,
but we can't set the path
for you, right?
What you guys have
is a product and an idea
and a hope.
I'm out.
tomorrow.
Mark, so are you in?
I'm in.
And that's your offer?
That is my offer.
They're delivering your brand
to a whole bunch of customers.
Is it a deal
you would do?
