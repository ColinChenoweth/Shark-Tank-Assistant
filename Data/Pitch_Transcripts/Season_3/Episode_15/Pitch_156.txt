Glad to be here.
My name is Gary Gagnon.
Gary, you got any sales?
My sales.
My sales--I would say...
(chuckles)
Are exactly where they would be
for any company
as new as remyxx.
So they're zero.
My sales are zero.
Mm. Okay.
I can explain.
Yeah, why don't you?
This two years' worth of work
is only now three weeks old.
Gary, is your concept
that you're gonna set up
retail stores?
Is your concept
that you're gonna sell
the component of how to do this
the existing shoe manufacturers?
Gary, am I allowed to--
'cause This is gonna be
a bit of a problem--
I know in my house,
my kids are religious
about putting the right stuff
in the recycle bin.
Right.
If I put these shoes
in my recycle bin,
will the garbage folks
pick them up?
So technically,
these can go curbside.
The processors
that receive it--
they don't know
what a remyxx sneaker is yet.
Right.
So what I've offered here--
mail it back to me.
I can guarantee
it gets recycled.
I can guarantee it goes into
a new pair of sneakers.
Okay. That's clever.
'cause my kids would like that.
They'd like the idea of putting
them in, mailing them somewhere,
knowing they're gonna get
recycled.
Right.
How much have you invested
in this yourself?
Um, $30,000.
No, no, no, no.
Gary, come on.
You're gonna need Well more--
I mean, daymond can talk
to this--
You're gonna need more than
$50,000 to build the molds
Gary, is there anything
about this process
that would be proprietary
But you--Gary, why?
What's the reason?
It's unique, it's different,
it's a distinction all its own,
it hasn't been done.
I'm first. Let's go.
I got a trademark name.
You should go for it, Gary,
but you got a bigger problem.
(Kevin) Yeah.
This business is
a cash suck, right?
(makes sucking sound)
(Kevin) right.
That's all the cash.
You didn't ask for enough.
You know, you may be crazy,
but you weren't crazy enough
to ask,
because even when you build
your molds specific to order,
right, then you gotta do
the inventory.
they're done.
Gary, you're missing the point.
You're missing the point.
You're gonna need millions
of dollars to build inventory.
These people don't pay on time.
Daymond, what's the average time
a large retailer is
gonna pay you for an order?
It's--It's 90 days Max.
It's gonna be 90 days,
But first of all,
they're gonna test it,
number one,
second of all, after one month
on the shelves,
they reduce it by, I think,
10% each week
that it stays on the shelf.
So before you know it--
before you know it...
it really is hell, isn't it?
So, Gary, that's my problem.
If you're successful,
you could go bankrupt.
I'm out.
Gary, where do you live
in the country?
I live in north Carolina.
Okay, it gets cold there
in february.
You know what I'm thinking?
Take these shoes, burn 'em.
Stay warm.
You can't burn 'em.
They'll get recycled before they
get burned, But thank you.
Please, I implore you,
let me burn those.
Please. I'm out.
Gary, you're gonna get
that first order.
You'll make the molds.
Then you're gonna have to
invest in inventory,
Gary, I just don't buy in
to a unique sales pitch
that recyclable sneakers are
a product people want.
There's 300 million shoes
thrown away a year.
Gary, what are you gonna do?
Make a decision.
Does it ever come back to you,
say "Gary, I need more percent"?
no.
No.
Good job, Gary.
I just--I just created
another job for myself.
All right?
(mark) You hired him.
He paid--
Thank you, daymond.
Thank you.
How many people...
I'm not gonna let you down.
Get paid to hire daymond?
Right?
I'm gonna believe in you.
Thank you, sir.
(Robert) Nice job.
It's a good deal, Gary.
Congratulations.
Thank you for all your support.
You, too, Kevin.
(Robert) Congratulations.
Thanks for the shoes.
Good luck to you.
