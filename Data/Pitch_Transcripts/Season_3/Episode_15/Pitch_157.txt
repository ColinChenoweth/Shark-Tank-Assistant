Glad to be here.
My name is Gary Gagnon.
I'm the founder and creator
of remyxx.
I'm asking for $50,000
for 10% of my company.
What I have for you here today
is more than
just a great product.
It's an innovation.
It's a sneaker
with a purpose.
As you can see,
I have cool, casual sneakers
in strong colors,
with clever designs,
for mass market appeal.
to think I'm gonna enter
the footwear industry...
(laughs)
Yep.
To go up against
these big sneaker giants.
You see,
that's where I am crazy--
Crazy with a kick
that I know only remyxx
can deliver.
What's special here is that
remyxx is wholly recyclable.
That means all parts together
can go back into
the recycling system,
not the trash,
for zero landfill impact.
Sharks, I'm asking you to be
a pioneer.
I'm asking you to join me
on the ground floor
to help make a change
in the way we think about
sneakers and green living.
Gary, you got any sales?
My sales.
My sales--I would say...
(chuckles)
Are exactly where they would be
for any company
as new as remyxx.
So they're zero.
My sales are zero.
Mm. Okay.
I can explain.
Yeah, why don't you?
This two years' worth of work
is only now three weeks old.
Gary, is your concept
that you're gonna set up
retail stores?
Is your concept
that you're gonna sell
the component of how to do this
the existing shoe manufacturers?
What's the game plan?
I mean, you're brand-New,
you don't have any stores.
What's the plan?
G-Game plan is wholesale,
uh, so it's gonna go into
your--your big box stores,
that just like everybody else,
they'll be right next
to the other big guys.
I'm different. I'm special. They
don't have this. Like I said--
May I see that?
May I see that?
Oh, absolutely. Please.
(daymond) why don't you
send out a tray of sneakers
so we can see the product?
Please.
No, give me a pretty color,
like the green or the pink.
Got that one just for you.
Um, and I do have a size 10
that fits you, I believe, sir.
Yeah, thank you.
Oh, these are very cool.
Here's some nice purple ones.
Is the logo part
of your branding?
Thank you, sir.
'cause I like--
I love the logo.
I do, too. (laughs)
I can wear mine.
Um, so the 5 is
actually a symbol
of the type of materials used.
It's--That's a--
that's a universal symbol.
The recycle symbol is
common domain.
Gary, am I allowed to--
'cause This is gonna be
a bit of a problem--
I know in my house,
my kids are religious
about putting the right stuff
in the recycle bin.
Right.
If I put these shoes
in my recycle bin,
will the garbage folks
pick them up?
So technically,
these can go curbside.
The processors
that receive it--
they don't know
what a remyxx sneaker is yet.
Right.
So what I've offered here--
mail it back to me.
I can guarantee
it gets recycled.
I can guarantee it goes into
a new pair of sneakers.
Okay. That's clever.
'cause my kids would like that.
They'd like the idea of putting
them in, mailing them somewhere,
knowing they're gonna get
recycled.
Right.
How much have you invested
in this yourself?
Um, $30,000.
And do you have any other
partners or do you own 100%?
That's it.
It's me and my family.
I have two boys
that are 9 and 7--
All over remyxx
with me every day.
Why do you want to do this?
Because you want to be
in fashion...
I-I--
Or you want to do--
Have a green--
You want to contribute?
So first I need to sell
some sneakers.
I can't help the world
or the--the remyxx effort
that I call it
until we--We get some fashion
out there.
What are you gonna do
with the $50,000,
and what's the next step?
Where I'm leading to is for you
to get out of the gate,
you're gonna need <i>way more</i>
than $50,000.
I'm ready. Um...
and you have
maybe 20 patterns there,
I think, to my eye, right?
Uh, yeah, I have 26.
Times six sizes each,
it's 120 different sneakers.
(Robert) Wow.
That's a lot of money--
Your point.
I'm just--
Yeah, let him answer.
Um, that's the $50,000,
for the molds.
So it's just--It's for the mold
and inventory
to get the first order sold.
And then when that goes--
No, no, no, no.
Gary, come on.
You're gonna need Well more--
I mean, daymond can talk
to this--
You're gonna need more than
$50,000 to build the molds
and create the inventory.
You're not even gonna--You're
not even gonna get the money
until after you deliver it,
it's sold through,
and then they give you the--
Basically your money back,
so how can you get
the molds prior?
The second I get an order,
great.
200 pairs, 3,000 pairs,
whatever it is--
I will make the sizes based
on that order I get.
Right.
So that $50,000
will go a long way.
Gary, is there anything
about this process
that would be proprietary
and patentable that we could--
If was your partner...
Mm-hmm.
Take to one of
the giant shoe manufacturers
that has a brand
that's known globally?
'cause one of the things
that bothers me the most
about this business is,
any one of the giant four
can do this in two seconds.
I believe there is
several patents--
Just how much you spend
on which one to protect--
the construction of the shoe.
These are not good answers.
(Robert) It's a brand play.
You gotta create the market.
(mark) He gave you
an honest answer.
There's nothing unique
that you can license
to one
of the big shoe companies.
That--That's the answer.
You know, if you did
something bad on earth
and went to hell,
this is the business
you'd have to work in.
Competing with the biggest guys
all around the world.
Why did you--
I'd have to be <i>crazy</i> to meet
with--Go against them.
But you--Gary, why?
What's the reason?
It's unique, it's different,
it's a distinction all its own,
it hasn't been done.
I'm first. Let's go.
I got a trademark name.
You should go for it, Gary,
but you got a bigger problem.
(Kevin) Yeah.
This business is
a cash suck, right?
(makes sucking sound)
(Kevin) right.
That's all the cash.
You didn't ask for enough.
You know, you may be crazy,
but you weren't crazy enough
to ask,
because even when you build
your molds specific to order,
right, then you gotta do
the inventory.
And if you get a second order,
you gotta get even more molds
and more inventory.
No, I don't need the molds.
Once the molds are done,
they're done.
Gary, you're missing the point.
You're missing the point.
You're gonna need millions
of dollars to build inventory.
These people don't pay on time.
Daymond, what's the average time
a large retailer is
gonna pay you for an order?
It's--It's 90 days Max.
It's gonna be 90 days,
But first of all,
they're gonna test it,
number one,
second of all, after one month
on the shelves,
they reduce it by, I think,
10% each week
that it stays on the shelf.
So before you know it--
before you know it...
it really is hell, isn't it?
You gotta there and start out
working in the stockroom.
So, Gary, that's my problem.
If you're successful,
you could go bankrupt.
I'm out.
Gary, where do you live
in the country?
I live in north Carolina.
Okay, it gets cold there
in february.
You know what I'm thinking?
Take these shoes, burn 'em.
Stay warm.
You can't burn 'em.
They'll get recycled before they
get burned, But thank you.
Please, I implore you,
let me burn those.
Please. I'm out.
Gary, you're gonna get
that first order.
You'll make the molds.
Then you're gonna have to
invest in inventory,
and you know what? The minute
they see that inventory
on a shelf somewhere, someone
else is gonna place an order,
and then you're screwed.
Because you haven't been able
to see far enough out
and to plan for it
and to ask for enough money,
that's why I'm out.
Gary, I just don't buy in
to a unique sales pitch
that recyclable sneakers are
a product people want.
There's 300 million shoes
thrown away a year.
Yes, and I don't think--
The sustainability market
is huge.
Yes, and I don't think
this is unique enough. I'm out.
Sorry to hear that.
(Robert) So four people are out.
You've got--You've got
the fashion guru,
fubu, Mr. Billion dollar
Fashion guy left.
Do your best sales pitch.
You've been there, daymond.
You've--You know
what it's like.
The difference for me is
I'm--I'm just--just starting,
just like--Same--Same train
of action that you might've had.
Do you own the name?
Remyxx is trademarked, yes.
You own the--and you do own
the Web site as well?
I have remyxx my sneakers--
Daymond, are these the shoes
from hell?
I like this recycle idea.
Unfortunately,
the offer I would have
to give you,
you really would have to
be crazy.
He said he was.
Gary, what are you gonna do?
Make a decision.
I-I obviously, I do trust you,
and that'd be a dream come True.
Does it ever come back to you,
say "Gary, I need more percent"?
no.
No.
(Robert) 50 grand for 80%.
Mark, will you pair of, uh...
done.
Remyxx courtside?
Done. Yeah, I like 'em.
We have a deal.
Good job, Gary.
I just--I just created
another job for myself.
All right?
(mark) You hired him.
He paid--
Thank you, daymond.
Thank you.
How many people...
I'm not gonna let you down.
Get paid to hire daymond?
Right?
I'm gonna believe in you.
Thank you, sir.
(Robert) Nice job.
It's a good deal, Gary.
Congratulations.
Thank you for all your support.
You, too, Kevin.
(Robert) Congratulations.
Thanks for the shoes.
Good luck to you.
And I wear a size 12.
(voice breaking) Boys, we've
talked about remyxx many times.
It's happenin'.
we got daymond. We got you.
Thank you for--
boys, for your support.
Thank you.
