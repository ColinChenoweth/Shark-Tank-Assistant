Hello, sharks.
My name is Phil Dumas
(Robert) Phil, very cool.
Is it a retrofit
to existing keys,
Phil, I have a basic question--
What do you sell it for?
The goal is to get it to market
at $149 to $199.
So, Phil, I'm very interested.
I'm thinking This is fantastic.
Thank you.
Why not go to black &amp; Decker,
raise the money from them
for a 1-Year exclusive
in the market?
They don't fund
the development.
They're happy to pay
a royalty agreement.
Now they're not my only pony.
Anything with a key, anything
with a password, we can go to.
We just need to further develop
the technology.
Okay, you've--You got
to this point--
Well, Phil, let's be clear.
That doesn't get you
to profitability.
That simply gets you
to end of proof of concept.
No, the $500,000 does.
Right.
The extra $600,000
gets us to profitability.
So how are you gonna use
that $500,000?
Okay. The first $500,000 is
patent protection.
Then I've got engineering.
Phil, I love the fact
that you love something
as Boring as locks.
(laughs)
I-I've been in internet security
for 28 years,
Thank you very much.
No, no, no. Phil, did I say
it's our only market?
Okay. All right.
I'm saying We need somebody
to step up, prove the market
so we can go sell it
to other people.
Phil. Phil, I have an offer,
all right?
Okay.
Because for whatever reason,
since you presented this,
I'm gonna be annoyed every time
I pull out my key from now on.
But I'm gonna give you
half of the $500,000
for 25% of the business
if you get mark cuban
to buy the other 25%.
(laughs)
Thank you for your offer.
Why don't you see
what mark has to say?
I'm waiting.
So am I.
(Barbara laughs)
Phil, two words--
Great presentation.
Thank you.
Um, I want to be
in this tech space really bad,
but I have some exit wounds
from other deals I've done.
I have a partnership with great
product development people.
So, Phil,
what I'm willing to do is
I'm gonna take up Kevin
on his contribution,
(Robert) Phil, hang on a sec.
Hang on a sec.
Key thing
in what Mr. Cuban said.
You're gonna have to raise
more money.
Phil, look, you know from
your background in tech,
it's not about 2%, 5%, right?
It's about the assistance you're
going to get
