Hello, sharks.
My name is Phil Dumas
and my company is
unikey technologies.
I'm looking
for a $500,000 investment
for a 33% equity stake.
My passion is access control.
I know that sounds weird,
but it really is.
Now the interesting thing
about this market to me is
is that the key really has not
evolved in over 1,100 years.
That's a long time.
But my product, unikey,
is the revolution of the key.
I'm gonna incorporate your key
into your mobile phone.
And now, you can take
this big old bulky keychain
and get rid of it.
It's that simple.
(keys thud)
Let me show you how it works.
As long as I'm in range
of the lock,
I can control it.
(whirs)
Oh.
Now I simply walk out of range,
and, mark,
if you could do me a favor
and just hang on
to my phone/key for me.
You can see just a regular user
has no control over the lock.
They can only lock it. They
cannot unlock the lock again.
So if somebody leaves,
they can lock the lock for you.
Cool.
(Barbara) Mm.
Now if I come back into range,
you'll see
I gain access again.
This is me. Walking up,
I gain access to my lock.
It's that simple.
Now another unique thing
about unikey is
is by having the key
on your phone,
we can send and receive keys
to and from other users
on a onetime extended
and permanent use basis.
So if you have a friend
come in to town
and gets home before you,
you can send him a onetime key.
If you have a maid service that
comes over every wednesday
from 2:00 to 3:00 p.M.,
their key can work
for just that period of time
so you can rest assured
they can't get into your home
at any other time.
And then obviously,
you can send a permanent key
to your spouse and your kids.
But more importantly, at any
time, you can delete these keys.
It's that simple.
So with your help,
your capital, and experience,
we can change
the access control market.
Thank you very much for your
time. Are there any questions?
(Robert) Phil, very cool.
Is it a retrofit
to existing keys,
or do I have to buy
a brand-New lock,
brand-New handle,
brand-New everything?
Great question.
Our technology is two bolts out,
two bolts in with a new lock.
On that lock, what is yours?
New lock.
You have to buy a new lock?
Yes, we have the technology
that goes into the lock.
I'm actually working With
black &amp; Decker right now.
Can I use the regular original
key on that lock if I want?
Yes. So if your phone dies
or you don't have it with you,
we recommend you keep
a key laying around
or one of your neighbors.
You can just walk up
and use a standard key.
Is this patented?
We have an all-Inclusive
provisional patent filed,
which part of the equity,
uh, money that I'm raising
is gonna use to take that
into a nonprovisional status.
Is your strategy to license this
technology to a manufacturer
that distributes locks?
Yes, so I'm working
with black &amp; Decker
on a licensing structure
of my technology,
their lock, their sales,
their marketing.
So what's the next step
With black &amp; Decker?
I'm gonna drop This off
tomorrow,
and they're presenting it
at their closed door
Executive Meeting next week.
Phil, I have a basic question--
What do you sell it for?
The goal is to get it to market
at $149 to $199.
And that's ultimately up
to black &amp; Decker,
how they decide to price it.
What about someone who just
wants to use a key?
What do they pay
for a similar lock?
$30.
So the difference is $100.
Should I be worried
that it's such a huge premium
to an ordinary lock
in this economy?
Absolutely not. People are
buying technologies.
So, Phil, I'm very interested.
I'm thinking This is fantastic.
Thank you.
Why not go to black &amp; Decker,
raise the money from them
for a 1-Year exclusive
in the market?
They don't fund
the development.
They're happy to pay
a royalty agreement.
Now they're not my only pony.
Anything with a key, anything
with a password, we can go to.
We just need to further develop
the technology.
And they're a customer that
really wants this technology.
And if they don't--
I'll be honest with you--
We can take this
to market ourselves
and do very well
on the internet.
In your dealings
with black &amp; Decker,
what do you assume
the royalty to be?
Uh, I want to go for about
7 1/2% of gross sales.
You've asked for $500,000
for a third of the business,
so you're telling me it's worth
one and a half million total.
Post-Money, yes.
How did you come up
with that value?
Pre-Money, $1 million is
very reasonable
for a tech company
with technology like this.
I think mark
can attest to that.
It's not outrageous.
Post-Money--$1.5 million.
How much more money are
you gonna need
to get the first one sold?
I-I really need $1.1 million
to hit profitability.
Now the $500,000 is
I'm calling round "a,"
and there's
an extra $600,000 tranche--
Okay, you've--You got
to this point--
Well, Phil, let's be clear.
That doesn't get you
to profitability.
That simply gets you
to end of proof of concept.
No, the $500,000 does.
Right.
The extra $600,000
gets us to profitability.
So how are you gonna use
that $500,000?
Okay. The first $500,000 is
patent protection.
Then I've got engineering.
So that's a couple hundred
thousand dollars.
Um, we've got equipment
that we need.
We need to buy a bluetooth
full development Stack.
Those cost a minimum
of 50 grand.
$500,000--That is
the absolute minimum
I can take it
from point "a" to point "B."
And there's a little bit
of cushion in there,
but to be honest,
I'd like a little bit more.
But $500,000 is
a lot of money.
Absolutely. But for a product
like this--
Now don't think--'cause, you
know, a lot of people think
'cause you're sitting up here
with us that that's easy.
That's a lot of money.
No, I don't think
it's easy at all.
I haven't raised it yet.
(chuckles)
So agree with me on this.
Yeah.
The entire value of this concept
is hinging on a deal
with black &amp; Decker.
Absolutely not.
Okay, that's one channel.
Anything in access control
we can go into.
I'm not putting all my eggs
in that one basket,
but it's a great opportunity,
and they're
extremely interested.
So my only Risk is
put some money in, develop it,
make sure it works?
I'm gonna make sure
you get your money back
if I have to sell 'em
all by myself.
How?
How are you gonna assure us
we're gonna get our money back?
He's a hustler.
I'm gonna make it happen.
I come from
the private equity field.
I'm actually--I have my degree
in Electrical engineering
from the university
of central Florida. Go, knights.
Okay, I come from
the private equity field.
Literally,
in the private equity firm,
my title was V.P. Of m.I.H.
I made it happen.
Oh, I love that.
I like it right there.
All right, look,
I'm in great pain right now.
Let me explain why. Okay?
You're very credible,
and I love your story about
making it happen
and the fact you come
from the private equity world--
That's all plus.
On the negative side,
the housing market is
a disaster.
Your product costs
Three times as much
as the solution that goes
in every door today.
We've got a lot
of development risk,
and if black &amp; Decker passes,
we have to market this
ourselves.
So there's a lot of angst.
I've got--
There's not a lot
of development risk.
Everything I have planned out,
we know what we're gonna do.
But hear me out--
We're gonna hit bumps
in the road.
We're gonna solve
those problems.
The hew home Market really
doesn't buy keypad locks.
People put those on afterwards.
So we're not directly linked
to the new home market.
But there's many different types
of deals in life.
This is one where I love
the story, but I feel the risk.
But I want a piece of it,
so here's what I'm gonna do.
I'll put $100,000 down.
You still have to raise $400,000
from other sharks.
But I want the end deal to be
for 50% of the company.
So 10%. You give him
100 grand for 10%.
Precisely.
Thank you very much.
You have to raise
the other $400,000 from us.
Thank you for your offer.
Thank you.
So at least you got $100,000
from the bank of tank right now.
It's better than
most people get,
and it starts the juices
flowing, my friend.
Okay. It's an offer.
Thank you.
Phil, I love the fact
that you love something
as Boring as locks.
(laughs)
I-I've been in internet security
for 28 years,
and I love it.
Nobody understands it.
It's Boring, yeah.
But I love it. It's Boring
to everyone else except to me.
Yeah.
Here's what I'll do.
I'll give you $1 million
for 75% of it.
You keep 25%,
but it's contingent
on Getting black &amp; Decker in.
Thank you very much.
No, no, no. Phil, did I say
it's our only market?
Okay. All right.
I'm saying We need somebody
to step up, prove the market
so we can go sell it
to other people.
And I'm very confident.
$1 million. 75%.
You keep 25%.
That's a lot of equity.
Are they gonna ask
for exclusivity?
Uh, in the residential lock
market, let's be reasonable.
What other market is there?
That's the largest market
there is.
We can negotiate that.
Computer access, uh...
Yeah, But the residential
lock market is what, 80%--
Bicycle locks.
So who cares? He offered you
$100,000 for 10%.
I mean, it's--
You gotta get $500,000.
Fair point.
But thank you and thank you.
Actually, mine's far less
diluted than his.
It is.
You just--
but it's still a lot of equity.
Phil. Phil, I have an offer,
all right?
Okay.
Because for whatever reason,
since you presented this,
I'm gonna be annoyed every time
I pull out my key from now on.
But I'm gonna give you
half of the $500,000
for 25% of the business
if you get mark cuban
to buy the other 25%.
(laughs)
Thank you for your offer.
Why don't you see
what mark has to say?
I'm waiting.
So am I.
(Barbara laughs)
Phil, two words--
Great presentation.
Thank you.
Um, I want to be
in this tech space really bad,
but I have some exit wounds
from other deals I've done.
I have a partnership with great
product development people.
If we use my people--and I have
a deal with hsn--
We try to go right on there.
Whoa. Are--Are you ready
with an offer?
Yeah. 40%,
half a million dollars.
And then there was one.
(chuckles)
Okay, I'll make it easy.
Thank you.
I get it, so here's
what I want to do.
And I'm gonna preface This
by saying
when I make my offer,
I also understand
that you're gonna have to
raise another $600,000.
So what I'm gonna do is--
Barbara, I love you, but--
don't give me the "But."
It's not a good sign.
This isn't your--
This isn't your wheelhouse.
But Kevin's strength
is in beating people
up over the numbers.
And I like that about Kevin.
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.
(laughs)
So, Phil,
what I'm willing to do is
I'm gonna take up Kevin
on his contribution,
and I'll provide $400,000.
So in aggregate,
it's $500,000,
but assuming Kevin's willing
to go along with this...
I'm in.
We want 45% of the company.
I came in here wanting to do
a deal with you, mark.
I think this is
right up your alley.
Would you two consider 40%?
I'll split the difference
at 42 1/2%.
(Robert) Phil, hang on a sec.
Hang on a sec.
Key thing
in what Mr. Cuban said.
You're gonna have to raise
more money.
In his deal and O'Leary's deal,
you're already diluted.
You've already gone down to 55%.
What do you think's gonna happen
in the next round?
And they're pegging the value
of this business today
at about a million bucks.
I'm giving you
a higher enterprise value
right off the bat,
more cash, twice the money,
and you're getting 25%.
All right, would you be willing
to come down on your equity?
I mean, you're at 75% equity.
That's a massive number.
I understand.
I-I-I avoid two rounds almost.
Look, you realize my point--
My point to you is when
you go to the next round--
Phil, you can't do that deal.
You'll be wiped out by the time
the second round hits.
Well,
he's offering $1 million.
Yeah, but the point is you
may need more than $1 million.
We don't know
what's gonna happen.
Phil, look, you know from
your background in tech,
it's not about 2%, 5%, right?
It's about the assistance you're
going to get
and the opportunity
in front of you.
I completely understand.
Right. So that's where it is.
And giving up more equity--
That's what you're fighting
for, the equity, right?
Look, 40%, we have a deal.
Then how are you gonna protect
me in the next round?
40% and I'll give you
two seats on the board
so you have control over
the board of directors.
So it's a balance of power.
What do you think, kev?
That's a fair guy.
With two seats.
You have two directors now?
No, I'm the only
board director.
So you guys have control
of the board,
I have control of the stock.
It's a balance of power.
Kevin?
I'm in.
I'm in as well.
You have a deal.
Done and done.
That's how we roll.
He took the right deal.
(Kevin) Very impressive.
It's the wrong deal.
It's the right deal.
Do not negotiate black &amp; Decker
without me there.
Yeah.
That's what he's good at.
All right.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
I appreciate your offer.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
(Barbara) Nice job here, today.
I really appreciate
your offer as well.
I like that.
It was a great deal for you.
What did he call himself?
A problem solver.
And he had a problem
right in front of me
and he came up
with a solution like that.
But, mark, I am annoyed.
You couldn't have gotten rid
of me in a more gracious manner?
Barbara, you ride in on a Broom,
you gotta leave on a Broom.
You pick this guy--Oh, god.
It was unbelievable to get
an offer from all the sharks
and get them fighting,
but I feel like I got the best.
I've got the two billionaires
backing me.
