My name's Ryan Custer.
I'm from trophy club, texas,
(Ryan) I am
the ultimate entrepreneur.
I have gone all in.
Hey, Ryan, time to get up. Dad's
got breakfast cooking. Come on.
My parents,
for the past five years.
Maybe one day I'll be able
to move out.
(both laugh)
You know, I've worked
my Butt off for three years,
developing a product
for what women want,
My name is Ryan Custer.
My company is cougar limited.
Ryan, you said the word
"Launch."
So the word "Launch," to us,
would mean
that it's not out yet.
Uh, yes, sir, it--It is out.
Ryan, can--Can our cougar
try it?
Absolutely.
She'll actually take you some.
But I want you to really look
at the labels.
The hot pink--It's
in a male-Dominated market,
so you've got your yellows,
your blues,
Ryan, how many calories in this?
Zero. Zero calories,
zero sugar.
Where are you selling them at,
Ryan?
We're trying out
some 7-Elevens.
We've got a smoothie king.
Um, I recently found out that
a, uh, curves in pennsylvania
picked it up from amazon,
So, uh...
so you don't have
a distributor per se.
You're making the calls
yourself.
I don't. Correct.
Isn't the problem
with the strategy is
you've trimmed your market
in two ways?
Yeah, but, you know, Ryan,
come on.
Look, here's what's going on.
and then cougar-Ade,
which is--
That's a big if, Ryan.
You went from me buying
a gag gift to 10 million women.
Look, the other big issue is
a half a million dollar value
on your company.
I mean, that's ludicrous.
So, Ryan--
Thank you for your time.
(mark) Good luck.
Good luck, Ryan.
It definitely hurts.
Uh, am I gonna quit? No.
I'll go back home,
take a breather,
