My name's Ryan Custer.
I'm from trophy club, texas,
and my business is inspired by
my beautiful girlfriend.
I'm 11 years Dusty's junior.
And when I started dating Dusty,
it just clicked.
Getting the taste
of dating an older woman,
I-I noticed
so many more attributes
that she has opposed
to a Younger woman.
She's respectable,
she's playful, sexy.
(Dusty) some of the benefits
of being with a Younger man?
He plays great with my kids.
(Ryan) I am
the ultimate entrepreneur.
I have gone all in.
I have invested three and a half
years of my life.
I've invested every cent
that I've had.
I've liquidated
all my retirement accounts,
my 401(k),
swallowed my pride
and continued to live
with my--My "Roommates"...
Hey, Ryan, time to get up. Dad's
got breakfast cooking. Come on.
My parents,
for the past five years.
Maybe one day I'll be able
to move out.
(both laugh)
You know, I've worked
my Butt off for three years,
developing a product
for what women want,
and the sharks will give me
the opportunity to now get that
in front of all the women
that--That are asking for it.
My name is Ryan Custer.
My company is cougar limited.
And I'm seeking $150,000
for 30% equity in my company.
The cougar--
Modern, mm, sexy!
Confident.
Like the woman herself,
the term "Cougar" has become
a pop culture phenomenon.
What started as a cute phrase
has become
a True social movement...
(chuckles)
a recognizable brand
with the type of awareness
that billions of dollars
of persuasive advertising
and marketing could never buy.
Well, I've taken
that cougar term
and applied it to one of
the fastest-Growing industries
in the food
and beverage market.
Introducing...
Cougar energy drink for women--
the industry's first
gender-Specific
functional beverage.
Cougar's infused
with 13 Super fruits
that gives the cougar stronger
hair, skin, and nails.
(growls)
(growls)
Hormonal balance support...
(speaks indistinctly)
And a list
of other antiaging benefits.
Those elements are combined with
a female-Friendly energy blend
that give the cougar
a long-Lasting energy boost
throughout the day,
with age-Defined support.
It's also a great mixer.
Cougartini?
With the launch of cougar
comes an even more Valuable
lifestyle brand.
I have secured
the cougar trademark,
and it is my vision
to introduce multiple
age-Defying product lines
to capitalize
on This modern cougar movement
that many women
now confidently support.
Isn't a cougar typically older?
'cause she looks Younger
than you are.
Well, she's been drinking
the cougar, the--
(sharks laugh)
Drinking shots
for a while now.
How old are you?
How old are you?
I'm 35.
(mark) 35. Great.
Wow. You look great.
Thank you.
(Robert) Isn't that too young
to be a cougar?
Well, actually, if you look
at the Webster dictionary--
There's an official cougar term?
It's a middle-Aged...
middle-Aged.
Woman that seeks
a companionship
with a-a Younger male.
So what is the age bracket
of--of--of the cougar
you're talking about?
Give me the demo market.
Uh, 30 to 55.
So, Barbara,
you used to be a cougar.
(Robert and mark laugh)
Ryan, you said the word
"Launch."
So the word "Launch," to us,
would mean
that it's not out yet.
Uh, yes, sir, it--It is out.
Okay.
It's about and about.
Um, we have, uh, distribution
in the Dallas-Fort worth area.
Is it selling?
Yes, sir, it is. We've done
about $60,000 worth of sales.
In what period of time?
Uh, in about three years.
(Kevin) Oh.
Oh.
(laughs)
(Barbara) Oh.
I'm not here to waste your time.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Ryan, can--Can our cougar
try it?
Absolutely.
She'll actually take you some.
But I want you to really look
at the labels.
The hot pink--It's
in a male-Dominated market,
so you've got your yellows,
your blues,
and--And--And, uh,
your reds.
So it definitely stands out
to the consumer.
Ryan, how many calories in this?
Zero. Zero calories,
zero sugar.
And what's that chalky taste
I have on my tongue now?
Could be, uh,
maybe the niacin.
Niacin is a, uh, detoxifier,
so it's got kind of
a little chalky taste.
You obviously sacrifice flavor
for effect.
It tastes like chalk, honestly.
Uh-huh.
I hate to say it's True.
I'm out.
Where are you selling them at,
Ryan?
We're trying out
some 7-Elevens.
We've got a smoothie king.
Um, I recently found out that
a, uh, curves in pennsylvania
picked it up from amazon,
So, uh...
so you don't have
a distributor per se.
You're making the calls
yourself.
I don't. Correct.
Isn't the problem
with the strategy is
you've trimmed your market
in two ways?
You said you gotta be a woman
and you gotta be a cougar,
which cuts the market
by really 75%.
You've reduced your market size
down to 25% of the market.
Why is that good?
That's good because this was
a gap in the market,
first of all.
There--There are
no gender-Specific or, um,
a female-Like beverage
that is nonrefrigerated.
It can be tossed
into a woman's purse.
The beverage market is
extremely competitive,
because it turns out
that the distributors
that control this space
get paid very well by
the big brands.
They get paid to crush
cockroaches like you.
I'm out.
Does the average woman
want to buy a cougar thing?
Or is there any element
that the woman's gonna think,
"I don't want to buy a cougar
drink. It makes me seem Old."
Uh, you know, that's a--
that's a great comment.
I'm obviously not a female,
so I can only use statistics
to--to prove a point.
Uh, you've got 7.5 million
viewers for "Cougar town."
You've big names in Hollywood
representing it.
You have, uh, a hundred
social dating web sites, so...
Yeah, but, you know, Ryan,
come on.
Look, here's what's going on.
You pick a name and just
because you can find a name
that has some
social attributes to it
doesn't make it a business.
You know, you've just come out
here and just said,
"look, cougar's popular.
It's a popular term.
"We all understand it.
"So if we could slap 'cougar'
on a product,
then that makes it work."
It doesn't work that way.
I'm out.
(Robert) you haven't sold me
on it.
I don't think women are
gonna flock to this.
I think it's a bit
of a gag gift.
If you had 10 million women
that bought this product
and you start to introduce,
uh, your--Your canned
energy drink
and then cougar-Ade,
which is--
That's a big if, Ryan.
You went from me buying
a gag gift to 10 million women.
Look, the other big issue is
a half a million dollar value
on your company.
I mean, that's ludicrous.
So, Ryan--
Well, the--the--obviously,
consumer brands
are gonna--Is gonna need capital
to bring awareness to it.
That's--That's a fact.
You're--You're not--
but I'm standing here
to say, hey,
those--Those clothing.
I designed those myself.
I made 'em in house myself.
Everything that you see.
I'm out.
Appreciate it. This, uh,
this presentation, um,
I hope, uh, impressed y'all,
and...
apparently not.
Thank you for your time.
(mark) Good luck.
Good luck, Ryan.
It definitely hurts.
Uh, am I gonna quit? No.
I'll go back home,
take a breather,
and go sell my energy shots.
I'm not giving up.
Cougar for life.
