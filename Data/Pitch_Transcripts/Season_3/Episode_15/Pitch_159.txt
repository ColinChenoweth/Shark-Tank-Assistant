Hi. I'm Frank campitelli.
Hi, I'm debrae barensfeld.
We are personal trainers
from Medina, ohio.
We are seeking $250,000
for 10% equity
in nitroforce industries,
which is home of the lightest,
strongest, safest,
fastest, most versatile,
most affordable home gym
on the planet--
The nitroforce titan 1000.
We've come up with
over a hundred exercises,
but there's no limit to what
the imagination can make up,
and right now, we just
want to show you a few.
Frank is doing
a shoulder press,
and he's gonna turn around
and be in the perfect position
for a squat.
We actually have
a leg press attachment
which we have as an upsell.
And now we're just gonna
remove the bench very quickly
with just one pull pin.
And...
This is our nitro shock.
This weighs 2 pounds,
offers 250 pounds of resistance.
Our gas shocks have no weight.
It's massless.
That's where we get
our benefit.
What I'm gonna do right now is
put this
in a pulling position...
(Click)
And we can do
a couple exercises.
You would do barbell style
from the bottom.
This is an upright row.
And we're gonna do a shrug.
My personal favorite is
the dead lift.
We like to say, tighten
your Butt, tighten your gut,
titan 1000.
(Frank chuckles)
right now, we're gonna change
the machine
into a pull-Down mode
and attach this--The, uh, uh,
c-Cable assembly really quick.
Really quick. There we go.
Are you gonna show Us
all 100 exercises?
No.
No, this is our last one
that we're gonna show you.
Um, with one arm,
you can grab it.
And this is very exciting.
It's a bench punch.
And we believe that the M.M.A.
Would be extremely interested in
that. They can't do anything--
That was a 30-Pound punch
and that was fast.
Is this your prototype that
we're looking at, right here?
This is actually
a manufactured piece.
We have, uh, about 90 of them
in a warehouse right now.
So you don't have any sales yet?
Well, we didn't really try.
We've sold 26 just to, uh,
clients. We're per--
At what price?
Uh, the price is $1,299.
$1,300?
Yes.
So what's your--
That was--That was
with free shipping.
What's your cost to build?
Our cost was $259.
You valued your business
at 2 and a 1/2 million dollars.
You have no sales.
No. We--
Well--Go ahead.
We've had sales,
but we've done no marketing.
We did all our testing.
Uh, there were same things
that we had to change
that I was--I felt that were--
You know,
from the manufacturing,
weren't gonna make it, so--
Where's the part where
it's worth $2 1/2 million?
Um, the intellectual property.
And, Frank,
you said you had sales?
Well, yes.
How many?
20.
26.
Because you're trainers, you're
selling the to your clients.
Right.
How much have you invested
in total?
Total--Uh, money-Wise,
about $200,000
between the two of us.
But this is
eight years going.
What's your vision with this?
Is this something you're gonna
sell direct to consumers?
(both) Yes.
So as--As you know, 98%
of all equipment sold
into that market
is never used more than once.
Right.
That's because the equipment
usually isn't good enough
for the user.
No, be--It's because most people
are pretty lazy
and don't want
to put the effort in.
Actually, most of our--
You know, your industry was--
your industry was born
with Suzanne Somers
and the thigh master.
And ever since then,
the model's never changed.
It takes a tremendous amount
of capital
to do a massive...
that's right.
Launch, and, you know,
at the end of the day,
you don't know until you've
spent half a million bucks
if you're gonna make it or not.
I'm out.
Who do you see
as your primary competition?
Every device out there.
One of the things
that this thing can do
that those other products
that have done a billion dollars
can't do is penetrate
the intermediate
and professional expert who are
already working out.
But, Frank, to sell
a lot of this equipment,
it's not guys like you
or guys that work out,
it's guys like O'Leary.
(Barbara laughs)
You--You need guys
that never go to the gym.
I really don't understand
why This is different from
everything else out there.
Resistance. Our gas shocks.
Weights will cause damage.
They also hurt your tendons
and your joints.
On this,
you cannot hurt yourself.
You don't get those injuries.
See, that's a tough sale.
It's gonna cost you $2 million
to educate people
just to even
start thinking that.
I'm out.
You guys, the real issue is
you can't come
into the shark tank
looking for
a $2.5 million Valuation
without having a proven sales
distribution model,
and for that reason, I'm out.
Every time my husband goes
on a business trip,
I get three or four handymen
to help me throw out
his latest acquisitions
and sports equipment.
So I couldn't think
of anyone less likely
to buy in to your product.
I'm out.
So I was thinking of my wife.
Would my wife buy this?
I-I think she would find it
a little intimidating.
It's too industrial.
It's too expensive.
It's too difficult.
It takes up too much space.
Why are--
and that's too many toos.
Too many toos.
I'm out.
Uh, and you're out.
Can we just put
a little statistic out there?
In the history
of direct-Response television,
there's been 11 products
do a billion dollars.
Four of them are home gyms.
This will be the next one.
I don't think this is the one.
Frank, debrae, thanks.
We wish you the best, guys.
(mouths word)
Barbara,
look how big that is.
Oh, my God.
That's bigger than
your entire apartment.
I would kill bill
if he brought that home.
If they want to keep their money
and be skeptics, that's fine.
It doesn't deter me one bit.
Uh...
we're just gonna keep going.
We're not gonna give up.
We've got a nitroforce
in our living room,
and we're gonna get a nitroforce
in Everybody's living room.
