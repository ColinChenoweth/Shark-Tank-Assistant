My name's Steve gadlin
and I live
in Evanston, illinois.
(bird chirps)
I live a really normal life.
I'm a dad. I'm a husband.
I love my family.
I work a 9-to-5 job
Building web sites.
A lot of that's
just sitting at a computer
staring at code all day.
So I think it's important
to fill your daily life
with strangeness,
with exciting things.
I'm an ideas guy.
I think of really cool,
interesting ideas.
A lot of my ideas
come to me in the bathroom,
and I think that's--
that's the voice
you really need to listen to.
So I have a product that on its
surface SEEMS really simple,
but there is
absolutely nothing like this
on the market anywhere
right now.
The first time you see it,
you're gonna roll your eyes,
you're gonna think,
"Nobody needs this,
nobody wants this."
But you think about it
for two minutes,
and you're gonna buy one.
My name is Steve gadlin
and my company is,
I want to draw a cat for you.
I'm seeking
a $10,000 investment
in exchange
for 25% of my company.
A little music, maestro?
(laughs)
? Hey there, sharks,
my name is Steve ?
? I got an offer
that you won't believe ?
? for the low, low price
of just 10 grand ?
? you get a quarter of
my company, you understand? ?
? You go to my site,
you describe a cat ?
? I draw it, I mail it,
it's as easy as that. ?
? I'd invest if I were you ?
? in I want to draw
a cat for you ?
(Steve) So I appreciate it.
Love the DANCING!
Thank you.
The turn to the side!
(mark) Oh, my god.
I saw.
That's my signature Move.
(laughs)
by now, I'm sure
you're asking yourself,
"How did this idiot make his way
into the shark tank?"
Well, let me tell you.
There is an economy
for stupid,
and I am overflowing with it.
Now with their universal appeal,
my cat Drawings
are poised to be
the next pet rock.
I charge people $9.95
for my cat Drawings.
$9.32 of that is--
is profit.
I took the liberty of drawing
some cats for each of you--
ones I thought you might order
if you came to my web site.
So, Robert, I know
you're into fast Cars.
Thank you, Steve.
Barbara, you just closed a deal
and you're looking Fabulous.
Thank you, Steve.
"Vroom vroom."
Mr. Wonderful, you are taking
your morning bath
in your tub O' Cash.
Damon, here's a fancy man
about the town,
and, mark, congratulations
on your championship.
Thank you, sir.
I have customers Who've bought
enough of these drawings
to start their own
cat drawing Gallery.
Why are people buying them?
People ask for
their dead pets.
They want to draw
about their breakup,
or sometimes I have
cats fighting an octopus
and a t-Rex on the moon.
So they try to test you for,
like, bizarro stuff, too.
Yeah. Part of it is, hey,
they know This is gonna go up
on the web site.
They want to show off
their crazy idea.
So you post
all these drawings...
every single one.
On the web site.
Yeah, an then they
share them with their friends,
and their friends come
and they purchase cat drawings
to outdo one another.
Um, and there's some people
who take this very seriously.
You draw these yourself?
I draw these myself.
I sit down at a table,
and I-I take this person's
very personal request,
uh, let it play around
in my head for about a minute,
and then I can knock one of
these out in about two minutes.
How leveragable is that?
How many can you draw in a day?
I can draw about 25 of these
in an hour,
uh, in a week I can knock out
about 1,000 of these.
But that's just with me
doing this by myself.
You know,
as this business grows,
because of the profit margin,
it starts to pay
for its own growth.
So the really nice thing about
this is I'm a web developer.
When I'm not drawing cats,
I'm building web sites.
So I don't have that overhead
that any other company
would have.
So what are your sales today?
Okay, I've sold over, uh,
1,200 of these cats.
In what period of time?
This is about a year.
Steve, what do you do with
my $10,000 if I give it to you?
What I'd first like to do
is build on my
e-Commerce platform that I have
and grow it
even further.
Uh, the other thing I wanna do
is start dabbling
into things
like greeting cards.
I love the shtick.
I love the Dancing.
Barbara was getting excited
when you turned your behind.
Not True!
So it's all very exciting,
but how does this go
from $9,000 to $100,000?
Well,
here's the leap of Faith.
Working with me on this,
you're partnering with one of
the most creative minds, period.
I strike gold in Very
unpredictable ways.
What you guys bring to that
is the business acumen
to take those ideas, we have
a fun little marriage there,
and I believe my ideas
are billion-dollar ideas.
But, Steve, the problem is
every business model
is all about Steve.
Nothing wrong with that,
but what happens
if you're walking outside
and a meteorite crushes you
into road pizza?
Steve, you've convinced me
you're a very creative guy.
But am I buying into
Steve the creative guy
and taking a leap of faith
and saying "Let's go, baby,
we'll figure out
the business tomorrow"?
or am I--are you trying
to sell me the cat business?
I'm trying to sell you
the cat business
and a partnership
with me.
Um, I-I have so many ideas
which will seem
at face Value
equally as stupid as this.
It's obvious that P.R.
Is the big push,
'cause you're not out there
spending money
to drive people
to your website, right?
Yeah, there are
no cat drawing Fairs or...
so tell me about
the publicity, uh, process.
So I'm a real hustler
for everything I do.
I tend to bring a lot
of press attention to what I do,
on a local level.
I e-mailed groupon.
I knew they had a cat mascot,
and I said, "Hey, I draw cats,
do you guys wanna do
a groupon for this?"
I got a response
the next day,
and then, uh, you know,
on black Friday we launched it,
and it was, uh, one of their
most successful--
it sold out very quickly.
Um...
and how many
did you commit to do?
Well, the nice thing
about groupon is, uh,
1,000 people said,
"I'm buying."
But only about half of them
ever actually redeemed
those groupons.
So you got to keep the money?
Exactly.
Look, very interesting.
Really small dollars.
Not investable
from my point of View.
Can I tell you something,
Kevin?
You know what
I'd love to say?
No, let him go out!
Just Let him go out!
But I want you
to go out,
and then I want you to go back
to your hotel tonight,
put your head
on your Pillow.
I promise you the last thing
That's going through your head
before you go to sleep is...
? I want to draw
a cat for you ?
(sharks laugh)
? I want to draw
a cat for you ?
I beg you, please,
let me do this--
I'm out.
Okay. I accept--I accept it,
and I'd like to counter,
if I could.
(laughter)
So, Steve, you've done
a phenomenal job
of free P.R.,
but does it worry you that
after all this P.R.,
that the net result
is $7,000?
I'm out.
These guys
just don't get it.
I get it.
I love your Creativity.
Thank you.
I'll give you 25 grand
for 33%. Just say "Yes."
25 grand, 33%.
Oh, man.
'cause if you don't--
if you say "No,"
that means you don't
really wanna work.
I'm interested.
I'm interested. Hold on.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Steve, you gotta
make a call here!
Now, mark, I would love
to partner with you on this.
I wanna ask one thing.
What's that?
Maybe 1 in 1,000 cats,
will you pitch in
and draw it for me?
Yes.
You got a deal.
Done!
what?
I love it.
You're hysterical.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm very excited.
Like this?
Hit it!
(daymond) to the side!
(laughter)
Turn around. Ready?
(laughter)
Turn around.
(Barbara) No, it's not.
It's good.
Oh! (laughs)
I love it.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations.
We're gonna do great.
Thank you very much.
We're gonna make
a lot of money.
Pfft!
(laughs)
Thank you, guys. Can't wait
to work with you.
Thanks, Steve.
All right. Thank you so much,
mark. Take care.
I don't care how Hard
you look,
you cannot find
talented people like that...
yep.
(Barbara) Mm.
That have the vision
and have the guts...
and the enthusiasm.
Like the guts to go,
"this guy's the guy."
You're gonna make a lot
of money with him.
I love it.
It's hilarious to me
that a silly little joke
I started a long time ago
has come far enough
to where mark Cuban
just became
a business partner of mine.
Holy freaking cow,
that's awesome.
Oh, my gosh.
