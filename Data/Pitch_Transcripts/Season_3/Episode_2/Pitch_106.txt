My name is Dave Greco
and my business
is the salespreneur.
And I'm seeking
a $90,000 investment
in exchange for 40% equity
in my firm.
And I'm an expert
sales professional.
I could sell anything
to anyone,
and I've always
hit my quota.
Been in the top 2% of every firm
I've ever worked for.
And I've won
every sales performance award
there is to win.
When I was 5 years old,
I would sell pencils
out of my parents' house
for 10 cents a piece
to my neighbors.
I've been selling
ever Since.
That's why I created
the salespreneur system.
I've developed a system
to get you
in front of the real Decision
maker who can make the buy,
who can say "Yes."
Now our system consists
of two critical components--
the first is missile--
a razor-sharp
step-by-Step system
which teaches you how to find,
get in front of,
and what to say
to your original buyer.
Second is roadmapp--
an INDUSTRY-specific guide
which teaches you
how to frame your pitch
to your audience
once you're inside
and in front of them.
We're successfully deployed
in several companies
and we want to sell it
through a downloadable
mobile Application.
Great salespeople
are trained, not born.
Give me a "C" Performer
with a solid work ethic,
and I promise you my system
will teach them
to close more deals
than the smartest person
in any room.
Salespreneur is <i>the </i>tool
which helps sales professionals
in any industry.
Dave, you're trying
to sell me the idea
that you can make anybody
into a great salesman?
That's it.
I'm here for one reason--
to close this deal.
What questions
can I answer for you?
How much have you sold?
$40,000...
dollars worth?
In the last three months.
And how many organizations?
We're in 5 organizations,
and 3 of the fortune 300.
Can you walk us through
the business models?
How do you get paid?
Right now,
me or somebody
from my team will go out
and teach the system.
Then we sell them
the actual booklets
that you see in print.
All right. You've got
three "Fortune" Accounts...
correct.
And you've only sold, between
the 3 of them, $40,000?
We've only been selling
three months.
And what's a typical sale?
Break down a sale for me.
A typical sale would be anywhere
between 10 to 20 people
in a room, where--
and so they each buy a book?
They each buy a book.
It's per seat.
(Barbara) Who's in those seats?
The sales reps.
Corporations buying
the books?
The corporations are buying
the system for their people.
What percentage increase,
on average,
am I gonna get
in increased sales
because they took your system?
At least 40%.
40%?
40%. And here--
David, if you really can
increase sales 40%,
why haven't you sold
thousands?
He's only been
in business three months!
He's only got one guy.
We're deployed
in a fortune 100--
one of the largest insurance
companies in the world.
What company?
Met life.
And met life Only bought
how many books?
We've sold 140 units
at $2.95 apiece.
Now we want to scale
the company
and take it to
a mobile application
and a video game.
Whoa, whoa, Dave.
Before we scale the company
and go into a mobile app
and... do all that,
if you were truly integrated
within met Life's program,
they have over 100,000
salespeople, don't they?
I mean...
that's the opportunity.
Why do you want to do
mobile apps?
Because--
I wanna do mobile apps
because it's more
predictive cash flow.
I can measure the lifetime
value of my customer that way.
Okay, David,
but isn't the real
opportunity of it to sell more
to the fortune 100 accounts?
There is, absolutely.
But I can't be
everywhere at once,
and I don't want
to be everywhere at once.
David, is not what
you're really selling today,
you're selling yourself?
Not at all.
I'm selling my system
and my intellectual capital.
Because what we've done is,
we've trademarked
and copy written
all of our material here.
So it's basically,
the secret sauce is right here.
And if you deploy this
and you follow it,
it's like a diet.
We have a company in Boston,
a small start-up,
that just got
their second round of funding,
and we just took their sales
from $30 to $60 million.
May I see that
secret sauce a minute?
How can you have done that
in three months?
Robert, you should partner
with me to find out.
(laughs)
This guy's a salesman.
Being a salesperson's
about being adaptive.
Do me a favor, David.
Can you sell me this pen?
Sell us this pen
right here.
Absolutely.
So, daymond,
thank you for your time.
I've got a great product
for you today,
and it's this beautiful
pen right here.
So the features of it
are it's shiny,
it's gonna fit nice
in your hand,
and people are gonna be
impressed
but the impact
that you're missing
is that this pen is gonna
help change your life,
because when you sign
your deal with me,
you're gonna be
a very wealthy man,
wealthier than you are
right now.
This pen--and this is where
everybody gets confused--
people--
sell it to me.
Sell it to me. Keep selling.
People focus on
the features and benefits.
Tell me when you're done
with the sale.
I just wanna see
if I'm impressed.
That was it?
That's it.
Well, you haven't gone
for the close yet.
The Impact--
the Impact is you
inking the deal with me.
But, David, isn't--
oh, wait, wait, wait, Stop.
Hated it. I'm out.
Good. So I'll do you a favor,
daymond. You're out.
You'll do me a favor
and talk to them.
(mark laughs)
David, look,
I-I know you can sell.
But the issue is,
today you're selling yourself.
To sell a mobile app that you're
not in front of me selling,
you've gotta have
a sense of credibility.
You've gotta have a book.
You've gotta have something.
There's gotta be something
that makes me download that app.
Well, I have to
start somewhere.
So let me tell you
what "Somewhere" Looks like.
We've got a production company
ready, willing, and able
to help us
produce this content.
I invested my own money.
I mortgaged my house
and I have
a second Lien on my house.
Who cares?
Dave, there's a huge
hunger in America
for people that can sell.
I don't--
I don't disagree that there's
a seminar business
But I-I'm just not buying
going from you to a mobile app.
I'm out.
Give me one company
that has successfully
provided a mobile app
that increases sales.
None. I want to be
the first.
Yeah, but that's my point.
The risk is huge on that.
I don't think my $90,000
is Well invested
turning this
into a mobile app.
I'm out.
David, I'm gonna ask you
a very simple question--
I'm gonna go for the close.
If I offer you $90,000
for 40% of your company
right now,
will you say yes?
How many people
did you close, Dave?
I'm okay.
They learned a lesson.
That's what matters.
Thank you, guys.
