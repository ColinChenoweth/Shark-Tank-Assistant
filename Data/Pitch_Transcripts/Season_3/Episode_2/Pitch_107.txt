I'm the one
that knows technology.
Don't fall
for this dirty trick.
I'm the one who gets it.
He's done it before.
I'm not gonna go
in a bidding war With cat guy.
(Robert) Oh, very nice.
Yeah.
(Rick) Ta-da!
I'm sorry I'm not as beautiful
as my LOVELY assistant Tiffany.
My name is Rick Smith, Jr.
I'm a professional magician
from Cleveland, ohio.
I'm seeking
a $1.5 million investment
for a 20% equity
in my company.
There's a huge opportunity
in the world of magic
in las vegas.
And I intend to create
an extremely entertaining,
family-friendly magic show.
Now this isn't just
your ordinary magic show.
We will be adding singers...
(upbeat drum rhythm Playing)
? Hey ?
? ooh, yeah ?
? yeah ?
wow.
(Rick) Dancers...
(mark laughs)
A unique juggling act
like you've never seen before.
I'm dizzy.
These are a few of
the featured entertainers that,
combined with my magic
and illusions,
we will create
the next big hit on the strip.
Now over the years,
I've created unique illusions.
I've thrown playing cards
further and Harder
than anyone in the world,
earning me a spot
in the guinness book
of world records.
Hey, would you mind
helping me out for a second?
Sure.
Want you to put this gauntlet
on your left hand.
I want you to hold
your left hand out.
I want you to hold this
piece of celery right here.
Please do not move it.
Now what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna take
one of these playing cards,
I'm gonna throw it,
and I'm gonna try to cut
this piece of celery in half.
What?!
whoa.
Oh, come on.
Watch Closely.
Watch the celery.
There it is.
Whoa!
Oh, man!
Wow.
Hey, can you--can you
help me out for a second?
Sure.
I want you
to sit right here.
Actually, can you help me
out, too, for a second?
(Kevin) Sure.
Come on down here. I want you
to have a seat right here.
Absolutely.
I have this lighter
right here.
All I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
set your chair on fire.
Okay.
No, I'm just kidding.
If you feel anything,
just, um--
if you just feel
anything at all...
Oh, (bleep)!
what? What are--
oh! Ow!
What's wrong!
You zapped me.
I did not!
(laughter)
Give me that thing. I'm gonna
light <i>you </i>on fire, Buddy.
Right now. That's...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to burn your behind.
The opportunity is right here
in front of me
to take all
I've learned and experienced
to the entertainment
capitol of the world, las vegas.
Okay, Rick,
who just burnt my ass...
sorry... (laughs)
I have a question.
Yes.
$1.5 million for 20%
of your company
or your business
or your production...
Yes.
Means that you're telling me
that you're worth
$7 1/2 million.
$7 1/2 million.
Let's get serious here--
why?
Actually, I'm projecting
to gross $12 million
in our first year.
I'm working with one of the top
publicists in las vegas.
We've checked out
many different venues
and we found out
that on the average seating--
between 400 and 600 seats,
selling tickets
at a price of $60,
doing two shows a day,
seven days a week...
but you haven't
done this yet.
I have not done a las vegas
production Show.
(Robert) So you--
right now, I am
currently a magician
that I travel all over
the country
doing corporate events,
trade shows.
How much did you make
last year?
Last year,
I made $200,000.
And I'm supposed to say
you're worth a million-five
because maybe in vegas
you're gonna make it?
You know how many magicians
are in vegas?
They grow them
like mushrooms there.
There's lots of magicians
in las Vegas.
Look, Riddle me this, Rick...
Yes.
Who burnt my ass...
I'm sorry.
Why don't I just take
my million five
and create Mr. Wonderful's
magic show in Vegas--
'cause I'm taking all the risk
with all the capital?
I call you up, say, "Hey, Rick,
you wanna work for me?"
and I pay you.
$300,000.
Why do I have to give you,
you know, 80%,
and I get 20, and I put up
all the money.
Isn't that what
this whole dig is about?
The guy that has the money
makes all the rules.
That's how it works.
Well, I-I...
you're an employee.
You work for me.
If I don't like your magic,
I fire you.
In fact, I burn your ass.
To get your money back
right away,
I was--I was thinking that
I'd pay you
twice your investment.
and that's
the million-dollar question.
If I make the money.
Rick, the reason
most of these shows don't work
and the reason
they're so risky
is you're not a known brand.
Nobody knows
Rick the magician.
I give you the $1.5 million,
you rent the venue,
the $1.5 million is gone.
It's gone.
The day you open,
if people don't know you,
I could go to zero.
That's how all magicians--
every magician in Las vegas...
(laughs)
No, no, seriously...
but Rick,
before they go to vegas,
they have a brand. They have
a name. People know them.
No. That's not--
that's not True.
Every magician doesn't
have a name going into it.
They all have pretty much
the same story as I do.
Why not start
in a smaller town?
I'm really up for anything,
but this is--
this is just my dream,
to be this--this performer.
And you just gave up on
the dream just like that?
"I'm up for anything." You gave
up on las vegas just like that?
No, no, no, no.
I've been working on this--
this deal right here
for over three years,
working with This publicist
who has worked
for major, major...
Yeah, but publicists just
want you to pay them.
But you pay publicists, Rick.
Yeah, you just pay
the publicist,
they'll tell you
whatever you want to hear.
But the reality is, you know
vegas is incredibly expensive.
You know to get into
a decent show room
costs a lot more than
a million and a half dollars.
Right now, the rent for--
for most of the show rooms
is between
$6,000 and $8,000 a week.
A week!
A week.
A week.
My closest friend is
Siegfried and Roy's manager.
Okay.
30 years managing them.
And he manages
other magicians,
and still Cannot get
anybody else out in vegas
because how challenging
the market is.
Now, he's talking--I'm talking
about the guy
who created magic out there.
Yeah, it's one of the best
shows ever in las vegas.
This is--
this is absurd. I'm out.
What you're proposing's
insane.
I--this isn't even
a-a horrible risk.
It's an insane risk.
I'm out.
You went for
the holy grail.
You're not quite ready
to go there.
I just think if
you would have told us
that we should invest in you,
and over some period of time,
we're gonna--we'll grow
with you,
and we'll help your career
because We're sharks
and we know how to help...
I--
and we'll give you advice.
But you asked for
a million and a half dollars.
I ain't gonna write you a check
for a million and a half dollars
for 20% so I can help
your career go.
You set your sights high,
but you set them too high.
And it's not gonna work,
so I'm out.
Rick, you missed
a fantastic opportunity.
I've never seen somebody throw
a card that fast. Incredible.
But I gotta tell you, Rick,
it takes 10 to 15 years
to become
an "Overnight success."
and you're not gonna use
my $1.5 million
to become an overnight success
with one act. I'm out.
You're such a cute kid...
(laughs)
but you're nuts.
Came in, asked for too much
too soon
with Nothing to prove
that you could actually
even attempt to pull it out.
Nobody's gonna give you
the money, and I'm out.
Well, I appreciate
your guys' time,
and I look forward to seeing
you guys in las vegas.
Thanks, Guys.
Thank you.
(Barbara) Bye-Bye.
My las vegas dreams
are not over.
I'm going to continue to look
for an investment
so we can actually
make this dream Happen.
