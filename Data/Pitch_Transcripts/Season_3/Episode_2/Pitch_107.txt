Hello.
My name is Donny Mccall.
My company is invis-a-rack,
and our flagship product
is the invis-a-rack
innovative Cargo
management system.
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Now it's because of my wife
that I'm here today
and have created
such an incredible product.
You see, I own a construction
company in my small town,
and I use my truck both
personally and professionally.
And there are times
when I need to carry
longer material and equipment
to the job sites,
but not every day.
Well, the only solution has been
a permanent rack
that is always up
and in the way.
(chuckles) Well, my wife said
she wasn't gonna ride with me
if I had a rack on my truck
and it looked like a work truck
all the time.
Well, one day I was driving down
the BLUE Ridge parkway
and I was inspired.
Now I wasn't trying
to create anything,
so I believe the lord
handed me this idea.
(metal sliding and clinking)
In less than 30 seconds,
my truck can be a transformer.
(metal clicking)
I can carry ladders or lumber,
canoes or kayaks
safely and securely up here,
while leaving the bed open
for all my other gear.
And also
in less than 30 seconds...
(clicking)
(sliding and clanking)
I can fold it down, and now
I can take my wife shopping
or even out on a hot date.
And so I believe
that invis-a-rack has
solved the problems that I faced
and the problems that I believe
nearly every truck owner
out there faces.
Now we introduced invis-a-rack
to the market in November 2010
at the S.E.M.A. Show
in las vegas,
and we were pretty overwhelmed
by the response that we got.
Now I'm committed to making
invis-a-rack and its accessories
in the United States.
I'm one man trying to do
his best for this country.
Now... (chuckles)
I know a truck rack's
not to going to save
the U.S. Economy,
but I wanna do something
that can bring some jobs
and some hope
to my small town.
Now I wanna help my family
and investors financially,
but also my church, community,
state, and country
in any way that I can.
I believe that
my vast Life experience
has brought me to this moment.
Blessings are when preparation
meets opportunity,
and I stand before you
prepared.
Thank you.
Donny, how much
can the invis-a-rack hold?
What's the weight-beared load
testing on it?
We have put 1,500 pounds
statically on here.
Still have not crushed it yet
'cause it was on my truck,
so I didn't--I wasn't ready
to destroy my truck just yet.
(chuckles) Your wife definitely
wouldn't go for that. Yeah.
Exactly.
And will it fit
on any generic pickup truck?
It will. We actually fit
on 36 million
of the 40 million trucks
in 2-part numbers.
Including the japanese ones?
Even the japanese Ones.
Where you building these?
They come from different parts
around the country--
ohio, wisconsin, and we bring it
all back to my--my hometown
in sparta, north Carolina.
Is your hope to employ
more people in your hometown?
I hope to--I hope to employ
hundreds of people.
It seemed to me when you were
talking about the hometown
that that was very important
to you.
It is, extremely.
What's going on there?
Is something bad happening?
Well, we're just in
an economically depressed region
of north Carolina,
especially--and we--
we've had some--
We've had textiles
over the years
that have now gone away.
We've had, uh, um, an aggregate
company that has gone away.
And so we're kind of--
We're kind of stuck there.
Donny, have you had any sales?
We've got $50,000 in sales
in this first year since--
$50,000?
$50,000 since January.
And that's how many units?
It's, uh, approximately
150 Units.
Donny, you fall into the market
of enhancing...
mm-hmm.
A truck--a secondary purchase
somebody has to make.
There's a huge
distribution system
that provides for that
here in America.
Mm-hmm.
Why aren't you selling
to a distributor?
Because they want
too many points right now.
It's not something
where we can provide--
Well, hold on there right--
well, the--the first question
should be,
what's it cost to make?
About $250 inside the Box.
Okay.
(speaks indistinctly)
So, Donny, the distributors want
to pay you how much today?
What's--what's the price
they wanna buy it at?
They think it has to be
somewhere it the low $300s.
And you're making it
for $250 today?
Right.
And at what volume
do you have to get to
in order to get it to $150?
If you can get it to $150.
I don't know that we could
get to $150 in the U.S.
Um...
okay, hold on there, Donny,
for a second.
You've said before
that you wouldn't consider...
I'm not gonna consider.
I'm just saying
that we wouldn't be able to.
But Let's just--Let's just
test that for a moment.
Okay.
Let's just say for a sec
that a manufacturer in Asia
could make it for $150
in quantities of...
let's say 1,000.
Mm-hmm.
All right?
That puts you in business
right now, my friend.
You'd be in business
with the distributor
that you're not doing
any business with right now.
And yet you're saying no
to that. Why?
(inhales deeply)
because it's not a product
that needs a distributor.
We can sell direct
to the retailer,
of which there are about 10,000
that we could get to.
But how do we get to them?
For $100,000
that you're asking for today,
what would you use
the $100,000 for?
The $100,000 I would use right
now would be to create displays,
to create a display where
it has this model on a, uh,
on a system that is clamped
to it and have, you know,
the, uh, a-a billboard
or, I mean, a placard behind it.
We call those P.O.P.S.
The P.O.P., right now.
Point of purchase.
Right.
And but you don't have
any orders.
I have plenty that want
product free...
for free.
So that they can... right.
(speaks indistinctly)
So you are gonna not only go
into the manufacturing business
but you're gonna go into
the financing business
at this point, because that
means that you're gonna,
as we say in the business,
hold the paper.
Mm-hmm.
You're gonna send it
to the retailer
and hopefully
They'll pay you.
But basically, you're making it
and you're selling it.
Well, that's not what
I'm saying,
is right now,
I'm not consigning anything.
I'm not--
you're not because
you don't have any orders.
R--
(daymond) With $50,000 in sales,
what was the profit?
Nothing.
Well,
because it's a start-up.
How much debt do you have?
How much debt?
There's about $75,000
on, uh...
at $50,000 in sales,
where your price point isn't
even the accurate price point...
you don't wanna
go overseas...
well, it is an accurate
price point. It is...
you don't wanna go overseas to
bring it down to a price point
where it <i>can </i>happen.
I don't believe the--I don't
believe the quality can stay.
So if you can find
a quality manufacturer...
No.
Can we take we take it
overseas?
No, sir.
Why not?
I just--it's not--not what
I'm going to do with my company.
Why?
(Kevin) Right now--Donny--
because I believe in what I--
I believe in what I am.
I believe in what I'm doing
right now,
and so if I can help
in any way, I will.
But that's not a way
that I believe I wanna help.
If you don't ever get to
make it yourself as a company,
who can you help?
(inhales and exhales deeply)
I believe I can make it.
I know I can.
Donny...
yes, sir?
You can't solve the problem
We're talking about here.
One man can't do it.
I'm talking about the problem
of getting it done offshore.
There's a reason
that's happening.
And there's a reason that a lot
of the furniture Manufacturers
are coming back.
Yeah, but, you know, to say
that the quality is bad
everywhere Offshore
is wrong.
Of--of course.
And so...
I-I'm kind of stuck here.
I mean, if you had
a successful business
and were manufacturing offshore,
you'd be employing somebody.
Mm-hmm.
And as you grew,
you'd be employing more people.
Then you'd bring it here
and employ more people...
(Robert) Donny...
then you'd start more businesses
and employ more people.
If you were successful, you
would need people to do sales,
you need people
to do marketing.
You've gotta do the right thing
for the business,
number one.
Mm-hmm.
And then everything else.
If the business is healthy,
everything follows through.
I understand that, for sure.
Donny, you feel particularly
resistant and closed-minded,
and that's a very bad partner
to be in business with,
all right?
And for that reason alone,
I'm out.
Okay.
Now we're right in
the meat of the number
for racks that are
on the market.
I mean, we're not too expensive,
we're not too inexpensive.
No orders, my friend.
I understand.
But you've made it impossible
for an investor to get a return.
Doesn't matter
where it's made.
Apple computer--
second largest company on earth
after exxon--
employs 49,000 people
here in America.
But it knows it has to
make its products offshore
to be competitive and make
a profit for shareholders.
Just like you do, Donny.
Mm-hmm.
And I don't hear that,
all right?
So for me, as an investor,
I'm not interested
because you don't want
to do what it takes.
That's the problem.
I'm out.
(mouths word)
Well, I do believe
that it has the potential.
There are plenty of companies
within the automotive market
that are building
in the United States
and part of what I saw
at S.E.M.A.
Was a company that had taken
their product to an asian market
to have it constructed,
and now they are losing share
because that asian market
has now created that product
and has set up a Booth
right beside them at s.E.M.A.
And--and being able
to sell that product
right from Under them without
any integrity whatsoever that--
yeah, but, Donny, integrity's
not American or Offshore.
Integrity's integrity based on
the human being.
I mean, that's really not fair
to say about--to say that.
You could get screwed
the same way in America
as you could offshore.
I have no doubt about that
whatsoever, for sure.
Donny, you know, I believe that
there's three courses and phases
you go through in life,
and I went through
the same phase.
First, I had to make it,
then I had to master it,
and now I can matter.
And I think you're trying to do
all of it at the same time.
Okay.
And I don't think
that you're doing it...
successfully,
so I would have to
regretfully say that I'm out.
Okay.
That's three sharks out.
There's only mark and Robert
left.
Right.
Start focusing on them.
Okay.
A factory worker's son.
Oh, I know. I hear ya.
I hear ya. You're hitting
a chord with me.
I mean...
You know... (sighs)
This is
the land of opportunity.
This is--look, America's
the land of opportunity.
It welcomes all.
Mm-hmm.
It's tough--it's tough
when people lose their jobs,
but it's a global economy.
I think americans can compete on
a world-class scale anywhere.
Mm-hmm.
So whether you make it here
or you make it there,
you build a successful business.
It's not about "Made in America"
Because We're all immigrants.
We would've never had
the opportunity to come here
if--if everybody thought
that way.
And--and again, I'm...
trying
not to be disrespectful...
Sure.
Because my Dad was
a factory worker.
You know, and he came here
to work in a factory
and swept floors.
Right.
For a guy who was proud
from the country to...
(voice breaking)
You know, I just remember
my Dad came here
and worked in the factory...
You know, people made fun of him
because he wasn't american,
and they called him
all kinds of names.
You know, my dad passed away
last year, Donny...
oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.
(crying) And, uh, I just...
I always asked him
what was he the most proud of,
and the first factory job--
not when he made some money,
not when he got promoted--
that factory job
where he swept floors,
you know, that made him proud.
So I admire what you're doing,
but I just can't get involved
with--With something
where you're not taking care
of the business.
I-I'm sorry. I'm out.
You know, Donny,
there's--there's just
a couple elements here.
One, I don't agree with
where they're coming from
in terms of you have to squeeze
every dollar.
There--there's always
a give and take.
But what I--
what I see here is
a very capital-intensive
business.
Right? Just $100,000
give or take
just for
the point of Purchase.
Mm-hmm.
Another $200,000
to $250,000 plus
in order to be able to get
to another price point
to be able to appease
your customers, right?
Mm-hmm.
And that creates
a very difficult return on
investment opportunity for me.
Right.
I would love to be able
to say,
you know what?
Let's just get behind Donny
and Let's just make this
happen," right?
Mm-hmm.
But there's no amount
of capital right now
that's going to get us
to a point where, you know,
it's obvious
that you're over the hump.
Right?
Right.
And so...
un--unfortunately, I'm...
I'm out.
Okay.
All right. Great.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Thanks.
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
(Kevin) Thank you, Donny.
(Barbara) Thank you.
I appreciate it. Thank you.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
You know what? You know
what's special about this?
Good old American ingenuity
is alive and well.
The American dream
is alive and well.
I don't disagree,
but his primary point was,
"I'm gonna make it here."
And Kevin brought up
a good point.
"If you could make it cheaper
and build the business,
would you do it?"
and he said, "no."
I wanna take care of my own.
I want people to--to have this
product and enjoy this product
knowing that the hands
of the people in this country
put it together.
