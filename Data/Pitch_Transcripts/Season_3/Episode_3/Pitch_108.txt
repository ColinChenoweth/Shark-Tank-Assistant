Hi.
My name is Megan Cummins.
My company is you smell,
and I'm seeking
a $55,000 investment
in exchange for 20%
of the company.
You smell is
a new luxury soap brand
That's a breath
of fresh air
in An oftentimes snooty
marketplace.
It has delicious fragrances
and a vibrant personality.
You smell started out
as a class project
back in college.
I was taking
a package design class,
and I had free rein to develop
any product I wanted.
I wanted to develop something
that had personality,
and what instantly came
to mind was you smell.
I didn't want to be blinded
by, um, excitement,
so I decided to do
a trial run to test the market.
I had about 1,200 bars made
in 2 custom fragrances--
Lemon verbena
and Lavender Mint.
Um, I brought you all
some samples,
so you can smell them.
So look at this. It says,
"you smell" On the front,
and you flip it around,
and it says, "Lemon."
You smell like a Lemon,
Barbara.
(chuckles)
"Like a Lemon."
It's cute.
Since I haven't opened,
uh, my doors yet
to actually have a revenue,
I have tested the market.
I actually told
a few blogs--
Oh, so you haven't sold
any of you smell yet?
No, I'm still pre-venture,
actually.
So you have bars just sitting
in a warehouse or what?
No, actually I had those made
and already got rid of them,
sending them out
to different companies,
and then almost overnight
it ended up going international,
you know--new York,
L.A., and Canada, australia--
did you sell them,
or you gave them away?
I did sell them,
'cause I wanted to see
how much people were willing
to pay for them.
And what did you learn?
And what--Yeah.
Well, people were
selling them,
surprisingly,
for between $7 to $12 a bar,
but I also found that
there were a lot of companies,
some very big names,
that, um, actually wanted it
to be more like
$4.50, $5.00.
So what kind of names?
When you say big names,
who are they?
The biggest one would be
urban outfitters.
They asked, you know,
how fast I could have
stuff made,
in what quantities,
and then what
the price point would be.
Megan, what--what is this?
Is this a paper product,
a paper version of the soap?
Yeah, it--it's actually--
it's paper soap,
um, so it's smaller
than a little packet of gum.
You can fit it
in your purse, your pocket.
I've never seen
that before.
It's something
that would be an--you know,
an impulse buy
at a register.
And you sell it for...
the soap bars are going to be
roughly about 80 cents.
Retail, that would be
about $2.25.
Not bad margins.
Not bad margins.
Great margins.
I like it.
Megan, if I invest
in your company here--
I'm a slave driver, right,
and I demand a lot,
so I'd be invest--
oh, my goodness.
You're gonna love me.
(mark and Barbara laugh)
I'm probably
the most tenacious person
you're ever going to meet.
I mean,
with your business skills
and, you know, your connections
and financial backing,
combined with my tenacity
and my addiction to caffeine,
um, it's unstoppable.
(sharks laugh)
Addiction to caffeine.
(laughs)
Have you planned out what you
would do with the $50,000?
It's actually just
going primarily
to building the product.
Do you have an order from
somebody to sell it to them?
Um, I-I don't have
actual P.O.S,
um, 'cause y--I don't want
to promise something
and then something fall through
and not be able to get it.
So, Megan, um...
I have to admire your tenacity,
but this is not really
a business I'm interested in.
I'm out.
You're in
a brutally competitive market.
I mean, anybody, including me,
if I wanted to,
could find a Megan
and get into the soap business,
so the only thing
of Value here is a brand,
which is unproven Yet.
Good luck to you,
and I'm impressed
with your presentation,
but it doesn't make it easy
for me to smell the money.
I'm out.
(inhales deeply)
All right, Megan.
I'm--I'm Teeter-tottering.
I mean, what makes you
the person
to take this
from concept and design
all the way
through to success?
Um, well, I guess
the first, um, example
would be that I decided that
I was gonna give it a go,
and in about a month,
I had international press.
You know, I had magazines
in the states.
"Tatler" In the U.K. Wrote
about me.
But, you know,
that's short-lived.
It doesn't mean you're gonna
continuously get that press,
and it doesn't mean you can
always convert it to sales.
What--what skills
do you have
that are gonna give us
confidence,
or give me confidence to say,
"you know what?
Once We get past the hype,
we can deliver."
Uh, there's nothing
that can stop me.
Trust me.
If you teach me ropes,
and you tell me
what I need to do,
I will get it done,
and you don't even have
to think about it again.
That's what gonna be so great
about working with me.
You don't have
to keep telling me
over and over
and over again.
Like, I know what has
to be done, and I do it.
I--there's just something
in my blood. (chuckles)
I'm sure you guys
understand it.
(laughs)
I... (chuckles)
so?
So for $55,000 for 20%,
we have a deal?
No. Just wait
a minute there.
Megan, listen to me
just a minute, all right?
Every Single entrepreneur
that I've invested in
on this show is making money.
Why is that?
Because I work my buns off
making sure they're a success.
When they call me,
they find me immediately.
If your soap is successful,
it's gonna take a lot more money
than $50,000,
so you're not in here
asking for enough.
But I'm gonna give you
the... $55,000,
but I must take...
40% of your business.
Because the truth
of the matter is,
I have to make a return,
and I also need a dime
for every bar you sell.
So if you'll give me
a dime a bar
and you'll give me 40%
of your business for $55,000,
I would love to be
your partner,
and you'll just be
another success Story.
Okay.
I'm gonna start to cry.
And I'd love to have
an answer now.
I--really, I'm so moved.
Don't be--you--
oh, hush. (chuckles)
All that warm and fuzzy stuff
came out to a bloodsucking offer
of 40% of your company.
This is a no-brainer.
My offer is clearly Better.
(inhales deeply and sighs)
Oh, my goodness.
Megan, I can smell
the blood in the water.
You've got Barbara.
You've got, uh, mark circling.
You can also smell
the Lemons, too.
I can smell the Lemons...
(chuckles)
And, uh, most importantly,
I smell your drive.
I didn't write you off.
Thank you. (chuckles)
I don't make a judgment
on how people look,
unlike Barbara...
(chuckles)
Uh...
do you have your own job?
I work, um, for myself
independently
as a graphic designer.
Do you want to do
this full-time?
I--that's why I'm here.
(chuckles)
I think it's
a fantastic product.
I think it's
a great brand...
thank you.
But my concern is,
are you gonna quit
your other job?
Yeah, I-I pretty much
already have. (chuckles)
Well, pretty much is not
all of it.
Yes. Yes. Already have.
It's said and done. This is--
how will you--how will
you support yourself, though?
This is my life now.
So this is 100%?
I'm sorry?
How will you support yourself
when you quit your other job?
I've been a little chipmunk.
I've been stowing things away
so that I could make this jump.
Megan, look, I've had
a ton of experience
supporting entrepreneurs.
I know what it's like to be
an entrepreneur and starve.
I know what it's like
to have all your dreams
just sitting there
right in front of you,
and you're just
knowing that
if I just had somebody
WHO could help me
and who had been
there before,
they could get me
over the top.
That's who I am.
That's why
I'm sitting here,
and that's why I like to get
involved with people like you.
Here's what I think
you need to do.
I smell success in you.
This is purely
an investment in you.
I think what you need is,
you need some cash flow
to give you the freedom
to make the right decisions.
She is so far--
no, Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You are so far from desperate...
So let me--
you should just be laughing
at that.
No, no, but, Megan,
mark isn't listening.
He's hearing half the story.
I think what the offer
needs to be is,
the business needs
$55,000 for the 20%,
but I think you need
a salary along the way
in the first year.
You have taken this and done
a lot of amazing things.
That's why you're getting
so much interest.
My offer would be to pay you
the $55,000 for the 20%,
but pay you another $50,000
for you to live
in the first 12 months,
so you have the freedom...
(chuckles)
to make the right decisions
and grow the business...
(Kevin) You guys are all nuts.
'cause that's what
I believe in.
This isn't gold bars.
This is soap. This is crazy.
Pick an offer.
I'm gonna edit my offer
for you, all right?
I'll give you the $55,000
for the 30%.
Megan, before--
Megan--
wait. Let me just add
something here.
In the big picture
of things, right,
it's not about the cash.
It's about who's gonna give
you the support.
I can make available time
and experience and access
to my other companies
as well.
I think the money
in the first year is important.
Right now it's about survival.
I think a little extra Cash
Megan, you gotta make
a call.
What are you going to do?
I love all the offers,
and I love all of you guys.
Um, Barbara, I've always wanted
you to be my business mom...
(chuckles) But starting out
this first couple of years,
money is crucial.
I think I'm going to go
with Robert's deal.
Ohh.
Oh, great decision.
Is that a final decision,
Megan?
(inhales deeply)
Yes.
I would--
I would think twice.
I would think twice
about that final.
Thank you. Thank you.
(laughs)
Congratulations. Great job.
You made a mistake, Megan.
(chuckles)
(Kevin) All of that,
and she just took the money.
It makes me feel
warm and fuzzy Inside.
(mark) Wow.
Choosing between
Those three amazing deals
was really difficult,
but having that extra money
is really what helped tip
the scales,
um, and I think
Robert's going to be
a great business partner for me.
