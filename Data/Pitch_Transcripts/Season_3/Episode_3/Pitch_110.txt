.My name is Travis Perry.
I'm from dothan, alabama,
and I have invented a product
that allows you to play
the guitar instantly.
Put that finger there, okay.
Now strum the bottom four.
Ooh.
That hurt your fingers,
didn't it?
That finger's got boo-boo.
The main reason that people quit
is frustration
and finger pain.
Even Brady,
my 8-year-old daughter,
was gonna quit guitar.
And I decided it's high time
that somebody
did something about it.
The area of the country
that I live
was hit pretty hard
with the economic downturn.
One thing that was
very important to me
was to keep the manufacturing
and the jobs in the U.S.
It means a lot to me
to give back,
so to be able to turn around
and offer jobs
to people that had lost jobs
is as important
as the product itself.
I really have to get a deal
from the sharks
'cause we're at a stage of--
a corvette.
We're like a race car.
We've won
all the preliminary races.
We're on the starting line,
and we're running out of gas.
My name is Travis Perry.
My product is chordbuddy.
I've come to the shark tank
to ask for $125,000
for a 10% equity stake
in my business.
My love is music.
I have taught thousands
of people to play the guitar.
Sadly,
I've seen thousands quit.
The guitar is the most popular
instrument in the world,
but yet it is
one of the most frustrating.
We all want to play the guitar
for one reason.
You know what it is.
To meet chicks!
(sharks laugh)
But what if a product existed
where you could push a button
and play a song
and learn the guitar
with no frustration?
Well, sharks,
there's no "What if."
it exists,
and it is
the award-winning chordbuddy.
There are four buttons.
It plays "G" ...
(strums chord)
"D"...
(strums chord)
"C"...
(strums chord)
and "E" Minor.
(strums chord)
With those four chords,
you can pays
hundreds of thousands of songs.
How much does it cost,
Travis?
Retail $49.95.
(mark) What's it cost to make?
Initially, it cost us $9.
Now we're down to $7.
So if you just wanna
pick up chicks,
it's $50 plus the cost
of the guitar. (laughs)
How cheap is that? (laughs)
Travis, whenever I drive
down the street with my girls
and a good guitar riff comes on,
I wanna be a rock star so bad.
If you could teach me
how to play the guitar...
I promise you I can right now.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
(chuckles) Okay.
(imitates Elvis Presley)
Thank you. Thank you very much.
All right, I'll play,
you sing.
Smash the red one.
(normal voice) the red one?
Uh-huh.
(strums chord)
? Amazing grace ?
Green. Just the green.
Just the green there.
? How sweet... ?
back to blue.
? The sound ?
oh!
Whoo! We're jamming!
? That saved a wretch-- ?
whoo!
? A wretch ?
go to red.
Red?
? Like me ?
(strums chord)
(mark) All right!
Whoo!
Y'all, what you've
just seen him do
would take at least two Months.
That's True.
Have you sold any of this?
Yes. In one month,
we did $150,000.
How?
Internet and we set up
eight local music stores.
Local where?
In--in L.A.--
Lower Alabama.
(all laugh)
(Robert) Travis,
how'd you come up with this?
I was teaching
my 8-year-old daughter Brady
to play a song.
She was fixin' to become one of
the 6 out of 10 that quit,
and I said, "Brady, I've had
an IDEA for 31 years
of a magical device, and you can
press a button and play a song."
She looked at me in the eyes
and she says,
"daddy, invent that for me,"
and I did.
You must be a great Dad.
Thanks.
(Kevin) Travis, look,
I buy you're a great Dad.
You're very funny, too.
(laughs)
and maybe you've
got something here.
But I wanna go back
to the money, because that's--
in the end, that's what
it's about, my friend.
You're telling me that I can buy
10% of this product--
it's not really a company yet--
for $125,000,
which means I have to
look at it and say,
"This idea is worth
$1.25 million."
That's right.
You walk me through
why that's the case, Travis.
How much have you done in sales
since you've started?
Since We've started--
a half a million.
You've collected the cash
on that?
Absolutely.
You brought in
half a million in sales?
And I've got--I've got P.O.S
for another $110,000
that we're fulfilling now.
Purchase orders?
That's right.
How do you think
you can sell this year, Travis?
Well... and the only reason
I hesitate, I--
the largest retail chain...
don't hesitate.
In the country is giving us
a P.O. In two weeks.
Have you guesstimated what
their sell through is gonna be?
They've--they've told us
50 per store.
How many stores do they have?
They have--
they have 5,000 stores.
Who is it?
Sam's.
Wow.
(daymond) Sam's clubs.
Wow.
Let me ask you this.
Why do you need $125,000 today?
We're building right now
at my plant in dothan, alabama.
And by the way, this is
a 100% U.S.A.-Made Product.
Congratulations for that.
That's important.
Thank you.
Why aren't you making it
in China?
I want it to be U.S.A.
I think that's the downfall
of our country.
I bet you they can make that
for 80 cents.
They probably can.
Yeah, you can squeeze
another Nickel out...
it's not a Nickel.
But it--but it's--a dollar.
Sometimes it feels good to
do the right thing, so I'm--
he comes from a territory's
that's been destroyed.
I think the people need
the jobs.
Good for you, Travis.
They are--yeah, they do.
Good for you.
All right, Travis,
I think you have something
really interesting here, but...
I don't like your valuation,
my friend.
Sure.
But I believe if it works,
it'll get its place in retail
in places like
guitar center.
I've lived with Guitars
my whole life.
I got a lot of 'em.
I play guitar.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'll give you $125,000...
for 20%,
and I'll personally endorse
the product.
I'll do an infomercial
for you.
Put my face on the box--whatever
you wanna do for $12 million.
Travis, that's how vain he is.
That's how self-important he is
he thinks that his picture
on the box is gonna sell it.
Yeah, he does.
(Robert laughs)
He does.
Hey, he's big in L.A.--
Lower Alabama.
(laughs)
Hey, listen, I'm up here
for a reason, my friend.
Don't make jokes about it.
(daymond) Travis, sir...
I think I'm gonna match
Voldemort's offer...
but I think you'll know
that I'm a better partner
so I'm gonna do
the same $125,000 for 20%.
This guy cannot play guitar,
by the way.
I think that's the Point.
Yeah. Barbara,
are you in or you out?
I'm thinking about it.
Mark, all right you in
or you out?
I'm thinking.
(daymond)
Are you in or you're out?
(Robert) Thinking.
Oh, my gosh.
Travis, you got two offers
on the table,
and those offers
will soon be gone.
So while everybody else
is thinking,
would you like to make
a decision?
I'm vacillating, Travis.
I mean, I like
what you're doing.
Okay.
I love the fact that
you're made in the U.S.A.,
but I'm not quite sure that
you're gonna be able to scale--
you're gonna have
to be that guy
that goes on the road show
all the time,
and how old are
your kids now?
10, 3, and 1.
That's part of the problem,
right?
That's tough,
so... I'm out.
I have an offer for you.
Okay.
I'm going
to beat this jerk's offer.
You don't want to go
with him.
(laughs)
Oh, you know, what a witch.
I'm gonna give you--
I'm going to give you $175,000
for the same 20%...
with the contingency that
$50,000 of that money
is used
to make an infomercial,
and you know why?
Because the best thing
you have going about you
is not just your product
but you,
and that's
the only missing piece here.
You've got to figure a way
to take you
and multiply it times 1,000,
and there's no better medium
than television.
I would not guarantee you're
gonna be in an infomercial
until you've rolled out
retail.
Travis, you--
don't let an investor tell you
how to run your business.
No, I have--
Travis, infomercials is
just another way
to sell the product.
Another way?
That might be part
of the future.
It puts him in--it puts him
in every living room.
Oh, please.
Travis, here's an offer.
I'm just a redneck
from croatia,
like you're a redneck
from alabama.
I'll give you the $125,000
for... 20%.
Same offer.
I don't think you need
more cash.
I don't think you need to do
the infomercial right now.
Oh, really? You want
to keep him locked up.
I'll give you
the $125,000 for 20%.
I'm the only one here
who wants to be a rock star
and can't play,
so I'm living up to a promise
I made to <i>my </i>daughter.
(Kevin) Let's summarize
what we've got, okay?
We've got
croatian rock star wannabe guy--
$125,000 for 20%.
(Barbara laughs)
but am I not the market?
And--what?
(Travis) You are the market.
$125,000 for 20%.
We've got
"I want to control your life
in every way known to man"--
Barbara.
Not at all.
He's the lead.
I just want to help him.
Um, I'm just pointing out
what you <i>do </i>want, and that's--
$175,000 gets you 20%
with her deal,
but a nightmare from hell
to work with.
We know that.
Really?
I'm a straight shooter here.
I just want to give you
some money.
I love guitar,
and if you <i>want </i>my endorsement,
you get it for free,
and daymond has
some nebulous guy in the sky--
we don't know who it is--
that <i>maybe </i>will endorse this,
but he'll do a--the same deal,
$125,000 for 20%.
You're in a really rare spot
right now, Travis.
Not often in the shark tank
do you get
four rock-solid Offers.
Travis...
those are pr-pretty good offers.
In fact--
this is a no-brainer.
I've offered you $50,000 more
to get you to where
you need to go,
to get your personality on tv.
People are gonna fall
in love with You.
Look, I can get you on tv
in two seconds. It's Nothing.
Look at the offers
you're getting.
It's your personality that
they're falling in love with.
Look, I'm just
a lonely shark here
trying to play the guitar,
baby.
This is so hard.
(strums notes)
Robert, would you...
sweeten your offer some way?
I'll put the $50,000 aside
to produce an infomercial,
if we make that decision.
So it's $125,000 cash
with $50,000 in escrow
for an infomercial?
Absolutely.
'cause I'm gonna quit
this shark thing, baby.
I'm gonna go on the road.
Me and you. Me and you.
I'm gonna become a rock star.
I'm talking about a duo
in the redneck riviera.
Me, too, Baby.
(mark and Barbara laugh)
do we have a deal?
Do we have a deal?
Travis.
Robert, the deal's with you.
Damn. Ohh.
Whoo!
(laughs)
Oh, baby, I'm gonna be--
(both) Yeah!
(all laugh)
baby!
I'm gonna be a rock star!
All right.
I can't watch.
That is Awesome. Thank you.
(off-key)
? Well, Travis and I ?
? we did ourselves a deal ?
? got a deal in the tank ?
? we got a deal
in the tank ?
? and we're gonna
make millions ?
? Hey ?
? millions ?
whoo!
We got it!
(woman) Whoo!
(laughs)
Yeah!
Ohh.
(Travis) My family now will be
financially stable.
(voice breaks) This is
a life-changing moment for me.
