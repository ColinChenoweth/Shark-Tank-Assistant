We have a patented
2-month learning system
and a dvd that takes you
every step of the way
from removing your first tab
to removing your last one.
(Robert) So you slowly take off
the different colors?
Yeah. Now you're playing
what the red one did.
Where it used to be. Got it.
Where it used to be.
My name is Pat Mccarthy,
and I'm the founder
of liquid money.
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company.
We all know that sharks have
an amazing sense of smell.
In fact, just one drop of blood
in 1,000 gallons of water
can send them
into an uncontrollable frenzy.
Well, humans also can get
excited by smell,
and there's one scent
in particular
that opens our gills
and gets us circling.
(sniffs)
the smell of money, baby.
It's the smell of money.
Can I get an amen?
Amen.
(mark and Barbara laugh)
Amen!
Good.
Amen!
Preach, brother. Preach!
(Robert and Kevin laugh)
so I got to thinking,
if such a fragrance can hold
so much power,
then why hasn't anyone
bottled it?
(mouths word)
Well, I have.
Introducing money,
the fragrance of success,
the sweet smell
of greenbacks...
(sharks laugh)
Available in Two forms--
his money and her money.
(mark and Barbara laugh)
My fragrance is based
on three core elements--
cotton, silk, and linen.
These are
the same three ingredients
you find in cold, hard cash.
Folks, we know
money can't buy happiness,
but who cares...
(chuckles)
When you can smell like
a million bucks?
Now my models are going
to bring <i>you </i>some money.
Now how's that
for a change of pace?
Love this Pitch.
That's wonderful.
I love it.
Thank you.
You know, this is
the fragrance of success.
(sniffs) actually it smells
pretty Good.
Do you know own that name?
Is it trademarked?
I do, and I was
really surprised,
but I got it.
In what category?
For fragrances.
Really?
(daymond) Pat, have you sold
this product already?
I have.
What are your sales
annually?
Well, annual sales are
$52,000, year to date.
What retailers carry it now?
So in the retail space,
I have--
which is one of my challenges
right now, Kevin--
oh, you're not getting
into retail, Pat.
I'm not--I'm not--
I-I've got--
right. I've got it
in very limited Retail.
Isn't the truth about
this business,
the--one of the highest margin
businesses on earth,
but large box retailers,
where 90% of this is sold,
would never give you
any space
'cause they protect it like
drug dealers protect their turf?
No. No, they will give him
the space,
but they'll give him the space
at $1.5 million...
exactly.
Because the JUICE only costs
a dollar to make
and $50 to sell.
That's my Point.
He's never gonna get
any distribution.
But I am talking to C.V.S.
Right now.
They are very interested.
How much have you invested
in this company?
So I've put about $50,000
into this product.
(Robert) I don't think
that's very much.
How'd you--how'd you
come up with this?
So I went to an a.T.M.
The bills were so new that
they actually stuck together.
They were--there was
a unique fragrance to them.
I didn't realize money really
had its OWN unique smell.
It definitely does.
You don't have enough of it.
That's the problem.
(laughs)
and then I read this study,
uh, about japan,
where they actually pump
that fragrance
through the vents...
really?
To increase
worker productivity.
They do it here, too.
It's called
ambient scenting.
It's actually about
$100 million a year market
and growing.
Well, you've done research
on that market.
That sounds like a far different
and more enticing market...
Mm. Definitely.
Than selling perfume.
Have you looked at piping in
the scent of your money
in--in
an ambient environment?
I-I haven't, but I have been
approached by banks
to use it as a gift.
When you open an account
with the bank,
they actually will
give you--
give you your money back?
(laughs)
Will give you money back.
That's exactly right.
Pat, that's all good,
but there's a little bit
of a problem here.
You gotta get huge distribution.
You gotta buy your way in.
This is what daymond was
talking about.
You need millions of dollars,
so...
so I put out one press release
on this product.
This product exploded
worldwide.
It's in Poland, croatia,
China--
$50,000 in Sales.
$50,000 in sales is not
an explosion.
It is in Croatia.
Uh, it's an implosion.
But it's
a very unique product, right?
The--you buy this product
because of the name,
and you come back
because of the fragrance.
(daymond) This business
is solely on advertising,
and $100,000
will only buy you
Pat, how much money do you have
left to put in this business?
Frankly I don't--
I really don't want to put
any more money into it.
So this is
your big play here.
You gotta walk out of the tank
with the cash in your pocket.
Absolutely.
Correct. This is it.
(daymond)
So why would you offer us...
This--
5%...
right.
For $100,000?
That means you are saying
the value of your company
is $2 million.
Well, I'm gonna go back
to my Point.
You're talking
about a $32 billion Market.
Seven out of ten are
for gifts.
Pat, you've broke--you've broken
the Cardinal rule for me.
Yeah.
When someone starts off with,
"the market is billions,
and if I only get
a small percentage..."
Yeah.
I'll be okay."
That's always a red flag...
right. Right.
Because you don't have
enough confidence
in your product to dive
all-in.
Now that's not fair, Mark.
That's not fair.
What? I don't care.
If y-you want my money,
and you want
a $2 million valuation...
right. Right.
And if you don't believe
enough to sell money,
then you're a <i>want-repreneur, </i>
not an entrepreneur,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Now you said,
money can't buy you happiness.
I've been rich,
and I've been poor.
Right.
Rich is better.
I agree.
By the way,
is this real money?
That is real money.
What?
It is?
Aren't you going to jail
for chopping up money, Pat?
Wow. That's not right.
(chuckles) Yeah.
Yeah, that's actual
shredded U.S. Currency.
Where'd you get it from?
I buy that from
the department of Treasury.
Well, that's cool.
Is there a business in taping
this back together again?
(sharks laugh)
(chuckles) No, there isn't.
I don't know.
No, that would be illegal.
We can't do that.
Look, Pat, the only thing
of value I see is that you--
you've got the name "Money"
in the fragrance Category.
Good for you.
Everything else is insane.
I love money.
I'm emotionally involved
with it, and it loves me, too,
so it really breaks my heart
to have to say this to you,
but I'm out.
I know that 75% of all
fragrances are sold duty-free,
and the rest,
you need backing.
I like
that idea of the license...
so...
I'll give you
the $100,000 for 80%...
and I'll go license the name,
and we'll make a lot
of <i>real </i>money.
I-I think 80% is--
is quite high.
(mark) Just remember,
100% of Nothing is
still Nothing.
20% of something growing
and big...
he's offering to put himself
to work for you
and pay you to do it.
That never happens.
Pat, I must say, I think
your packaging is Great.
Thank you.
Perfect, okay?
But that doesn't smell
like money to me.
You know what?
I get $500 a week out
of that cash machine,
'cause they always
give it to me in New $50s...
right. Right.
So I purposely do it.
Yes.
I always smell the money
before I put it
in my wallet...
right.
So I really know
what money smells like.
It's subtle.
This is not subtle.
Even though you look
like Robert Redford...
(laughs)
I'm out.
(daymond) you have an offer
on the table.
(sighs)
80% of the company?
Yes.
I mean, I really would like
to have control of this company.
Pat, it disturbs me a little bit
that we had to show you
the obvious path,
which was licensing.
I don't think this is
a perfume product.
I think this is
a licensing product.
I don't smell the money.
I smell failure with
the strategy you have today,
and for that, I'm out.
Just like money, when there's
not enough buyers,
my money becomes more valuable,
and just like real money,
you have a depreciating asset
right now.
Right. Right.
So unless you give me
an answer right now,
it's going up to 85%.
(chuckles) 80%?
So, again, I think that
this market has
tremendous potential.
80% is too much.
I can't do 80%.
Then I'm out.
There goes the money.
(laughs)
(Pat) I have no regrets,
turning down Daymond's offer.
The 80% was just out of Line.
Not in a-a Patch,
with the lighting like this,
that are detachable
and can be removed and--
but there's nothing proprietary
about it, right?
If I wanted to knock it off,
why couldn't I just go
and get this manufactured
and compete with you?
Because there's nothing
to stop me from doing it.
Well, I have
two patents pending.
And what are
your patents for?
The patents are for
the detachable lighted design,
and then the other patent is
for the fashion line
that I created, which is called
twinkle cheeks.
is gonna help you
go on the right path,
and I believe in you.
You're gonna get there.
(Barbara) but it's not
an important card here.
You know what's
an important card here?
That you get lined up
with the right distributor.
You're not gonna be
successful
because of
other people's success.
You're gonna be successful
because of your own success.
But let me tell you, women work
Harder, and you know it.
Ohh.
I work circles
around this guy.
Oh, please.
Oh, boy.
Absolutely.
Really?
I-I got here
because I didn't work?
No. Women work Harder
than men.
(imitates violin)
(chuckles)
Put one woman against a man
in any situation...
Please.
She will outwork
the guy anytime.
Girl power.
You know why?
All right.
Enough, enough, enough.
(laughs)
