Hello. My name is Kyle Rainey,
from baton rouge, louisiana.
I am creator
of tail lightz.
I am here today seeking
$50,000
in exchange for 50%
of my business.
There are currently
no products like mine
on the market today,
but soon my product will
be catching on
as a hot new Trend
in fashion,
with people of all ages
bringing attention
to their greatest assets.
(laughs)
(laughs)
(Barbara) Okay.
(laughs)
I hope those aren't
your daughters, Kyle.
One's my niece.
(laughs)
You just ruined it for me.
Kyle, I'll give you $50,000
to turn the other way.
All right.
(all chuckle)
Once these hit the market,
no one will want to be caught
without their tail lightz on.
Tail Lightz are
attachable lighted designs
for Jean pockets.
Anyone can easily attach
or detach tail lightz
to the back pocket
of any jeans, shorts,
or, Heck, even your hat,
purse, or backpack.
There are
tiny, strong magnets
on the back
of each lighted design,
which hold it in place
no matter what you put it on.
We can tailor our designs
towards all age groups.
Designs like the Smiley face
and sports themes
will appeal towards
young kids,
and our fun phrase designs,
like "Sassy britches,"
"Rock star," and "Drama Queen,"
will Appeal towards
girls and women of all ages.
The possibilities are
endless.
My Products are currently
in the design phase
with working prototypes.
With your partnership,
I will be able to design
slimmer Retail-ready products
and packaging...
thank you.
So that tail lightz will
soon be lighting up
every Retail store
across the country.
So who is ready to partner
with an experienced inventor
and light things up?
Who's ready?
I'm ready.
That's it? You're in?
That's it?
All right. Let's go.
I am ready to go out.
(Robert) Oh. (laughs)
(laughs)
I'm out.
So, Barbara,
you're really out?
Yes. Would you like
to know why?
Do you want to--
do you want to make
a speech about why? Sure.
I wouldn't mind. Yeah.
Sure.
First off, sitting on this
would be painful...
yep.
On the back seat
of your pants.
Secondly, I bet
they don't wash well
when you make the mistake
of forgetting to take them off.
Third, I think the designs
on these feel dated to me.
But other than that,
I love the idea.
(Robert and mark laugh)
guys, what do you have
on your tush?
Sassy Britches.
Sassy britches.
Would you go on a date
wearing "Sassy Britches"?
um...
you see, that's
the problem, right?
You've got your core audience
right here,
but do you think
it's going to catch on
and catch fire
and lighten all of America?
I just don't see it.
Well, keep in mind that
these prototypes are bulky.
I realize that, and that's
why I'm here today.
I need the funding to get
to that next level.
There's other products
like this out there.
They do make--
I have not seen
any other products
that combine the lighting
and the design.
You've never seen
a button that glows?
So what do you do
for a living, Kyle?
I'm a Mr. Mom,
I'm an artist,
and I'm an inventor.
Okay, and does your wife
make a lot of money?
My wife, uh, has financially
supported our family
for 13 years now.
She's wonderful.
She is the most amazing woman
Anybody could ask for.
So she's basically funding
your goal to have one of these
work out for you.
That's right,
and I am at the point
in my life
where I just really need
to succeed,
so that she doesn't have
to work so hard.
Okay, Kyle, this is not going
to be the one that succeeds.
I think you've got
that message loud and clear.
We've all seen this.
There's nothing proprietary
about it.
I'm out.
I gotta tell ya,
Barbara's right.
It looks dated.
I'm out.
I've seen ten of these
in the last year
that either were already
on the market
or already doing sales.
I'm out.
Kyle,
the important thing is,
it doesn't matter
how many times you fail.
All it takes is one,
then everybody can call you
an overnight success...
(chuckles) That's True.
So don't quit...
mm-hmm.
Because We've all been
laughed at.
I know I've been laughed at,
and my biggest hits have been
the ones people thought
were most likely to fail.
You are...
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
(daymond and Barbara)
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Good luck, Kyle.
Thank you.
(Kyle) It's pretty humiliating.
I'm just kinda wondering,
you know,
did I make the right move
in taking it here?
But, you know, you--
you can't live life like that.
You just have to try
and--and keep on going.
That wife is incredible.
Either that
or he's a good dad,
and she's smart
for letting him
keep on doing it.
That's True.
He's home looking
after the Kids.
That's the best job
in the world.
