My name is Shelly ehler,
I live in
Ladera ranch, california,
and my business is show No.
My husband Brian
is my high school sweetheart.
We've been together
for 22 years,
and now I'm a mother
of two adorable boys.
My boys Love
going to the pool...
Kiss. Jump in.
(yells)
but it's always a hassle
to change them.
The wet clothes
are stuck to them,
and to try and get them off
while keeping them covered
is really a challenge.
And I came up
with a perfect solution.
Right now I'm sewing every
single thing from my house,
and it's a lot of work.
I need help.
The recession
hit Brian and I really hard.
We owned a printing business
that just was not
recession-proof.
Brian and I had to sell our home
and we had to move.
It's been
the most difficult thing
I've ever been through
in my life.
I need this deal
with the Sharks.
Mmm.
Group hug.
My family's future's
riding on it.
Hi. I'm Shelly ehler.
This is my son Max
and this is my son Clark
and we're here to present to you
our show no towel.
We're asking for $50,000
for a 25% stake in our business.
I got this idea when I was
at the pool with my sons.
They wanted to change
into their dry clothes.
My older son asked me if
I would make him a towel tent,
which basically means
to take your towel...
and wrap it around them
so they can change their clothes
without anyone seeing.
Well, while we're waiting
for him to change his clothes,
my little guy started
getting a little impatient.
(mark and Robert chuckle)
and it was one of those
kind of mom moments
that you wish
you had four arms
so you could hold Everybody's
towel and make everybody happy.
And it got me thinking,
why not take a towel...
put a slit in it.
They can wear it
like a poncho...
(chuckles)
and they can change
without anyone seeing them.
And then the name
just shot out at me.
It's a changing towel,
it's a poncho, it's a show No.
Heh.
We made you some custom
"Shark tank" Show nos...
Awesome.
That the boys
are going to pass out.
Thank you.
So, Shelly, there's a bit
of a problem here.
$15,000...
is pretty well a nothing Burger,
to be honest with you.
Your enthusiasm is--is good,
you know, I have to admit.
But what's sobering are
the sales.
You have
a very, very seasonal business.
You have to stock heavy,
spend your capital,
hope like hell
they sell through.
The focused seasonality of that,
I do not find attractive
as an investment.
I'm out.
Okay. Okay.
I want to also point out,
when I first started, I thought
of it as seasonal as Well,
until I realized that it is
the perfect bath towel for kids.
Kids love using This towel
every single day at bath time.
There are over 1,000 water parks
in the United States.
I figure, if I can get
at least 50 of them,
and I think--
and I know I can,
if I can get at least 50 of them
to sell 20 towels a day--
that's doable, 20 a day.
They're open 3 months a year,
90 days. That's 80,000 towels.
That's almost $1 million
in 3 months.
You could sell
$1 million worth of towels
just to 50 water parks?
I think I can.
Maybe.
I love your passion.
I mean, uh,
you're--you're so committed,
but I've gotta be honest
with you.
I'm not as excited about
the product as I am about you.
I don't see it selling.
I'm out.
(mouths word)
Let me ask you
the most difficult question.
Yes.
You have
two beautiful children...
yes.
And it's a birthday.
Right.
The C.E.O.
Of a major corporation
wants you to come out
and make a presentation
to all their buyers,
and the only day
that they can see you...
right.
Is on that birthday.
What happens?
I will go and be part
of that meeting,
and I'll tell you why.
I shower my kids
with unconditional love.
They are my life.
They are my everything.
They know how much
I love them.
It doesn't matter
where I am.
They love <i>me </i>so much
and want me to succeed so much,
They would push me
on the plane.
(laughs)
My husband is
so supportive of me,
I would not be here
right now
if it weren't
for all that support.
I am not here standing alone,
I'll tell you that.
You know, my husband and I got
hit hard with the recession.
I've never been through
anything like that in my life.
We've had
four REALLY rough years,
and I have to say...
(exhales deeply)
Every tear I cried
and every prayer I prayed
has brought me here, right here
to this moment in front of you,
and I would not change
a single thing.
I know it's meant to be.
I like it, I mean, but the sales
are really challenging,
and--and you're saying that
the company is worth $200,000.
Okay, I-I understand
that my numbers did not
reflect that...
Yeah.
But I have to tell you,
I have a call in
to a connection
with--with Disney right now,
and it's very recent.
I haven't heard anything back,
but I'm gonna keep working it
until I get it.
Well, Shelly...
I'll--I'll offer you
$50,000 for 50%.
I'm gonna tell you
what I think.
I think I see
a ton of me in you.
I love your drive.
I love your passion.
I-I relate to you.
I've been on qvc for 14 years,
and I know what it takes, too.
I started making
everything by hand.
I like you so much that actually
what I'm going to do is,
I'm gonna write you a check
right now.
Oh, my God.
The check's written, Shelly.
Shelly let me just add
something here.
I see a lot of potential,
and to me,
that potential is worth more
than $50,000 for 25%.
So I'll offer you $75,000...
(Kevin) Ooh.
For 25%.
Shelly, what's
the advantage that I have
over these other sharks here?
Qvc.
Qvc, <i>and </i>I'm a woman.
We speak the same language...
what does either one have
to do with it?
And you know that
you and I are going to have
a great time working
together,
and I think with my ingenuity,
added with your ingenuity,
we will turn this
into a dynasty...
well, Shelly, here's what I--
here's what I have in common...
of more...
with you.
Show nos.
I know
the C.E.O. Of six flags.
I already work with the C.E.O.
Of bed bath &amp; BEYOND
AND buybuy BABY.
THEY SELL MORE TOWELS
THAN YOU WILL EVER SELL.
I'VE BEEN A VENDOR
OF J.C. PENNEY'S FOR 20 YEARS.
RIGHT.
THAT MEANS WE'VE MADE
A LOT OF MONEY TOGETHER...
RIGHT.
AND I PROBABLY AM SELLING
ALREADY 2 MILLION TOWELS A YEAR,
AND I'M GONNA MATCH
HIS $75,000,
BUT FOR ONLY 20%.
OH, MY GOSH.
I'LL MATCH THE $75,000,
STAY AT THE 25%.
IT'S RIGHT HERE.
YOU CAN GRAB IT.
SHELLY, I'M SURE
YOU ALL WOULD BOND,
AND YOU GUYS COULD GO OUT
FOR COFFEE,
YOU COULD HAVE
SOME ICE CREAM,
AND YOU WOULD BE BUDDIES
FOREVER, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
WE ALL HAVE CONNECTIONS.
I MEAN, J.C. PENNEY'S IS
IN DALLAS.
YOU KNOW, THE C.E.O. COMES
TO MAVS GAMES.
I WAS INVOLVED
IN THE TAKEOVER OF SIX FLAGS.
CONNECTIONS ARE
THE EASY PART.
MY HUSBAND'S HERE.
IF IT'S OKAY, I REALLY NEED
TO--TO DISCUSS THIS WITH HIM.
SURE.
(Robert) ABSOLUTELY.
STEP INTO THE HALL.
WE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY
BRING YOUR HUSBAND IN.
OKAY.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.
(exhales deeply)
(Kevin) I JUST WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING HERE. I'M STUNNED.
YOU'RE LETTING A WOMAN
WITH AN IMPASSIONATE PLEA
WITH A SLIT IN A TOWEL
SUCK YOU IN...
I'M MAKING TOWELS ALREADY.
LETTING HER CRY A STORY FOR YOU
AND INCREASING THE PRICE
BEYOND ITS <i>wildest </i>metrics
and value...
This price means nothing if I
just put it into my fabric Run.
Is a form--
is a form
of financial pornography.
We've got kids watching
this show that are learning...
(laughs)
Exactly the wrong thing.
This is an outrage.
They all have
so much to offer.
You know, mark is so sweet
and he has--
he really believes in it,
and daymond has
all these connections, though,
in terms
of his manufacturing.
I'm disgusted.
She has what it takes
to drive this business,
and, I feel, joined with her,
we can take this everywhere.
I already have five ideas
of how to make this even better
than what it is.
I just don't want to make
a mistake,
'cause I know daymond has
those incredible connections
in terms of Manufacturing.
He already makes
millions of towels a year.
Yeah.
He has connections all over
the place in terms of that.
You know what's best, baby.
Just follow your heart.
You know. Babe, you know.
I--
I know.
(whispers) I love you.
(whispers) I love you.
I think that
we can make this huge.
Are you not getting caught up
in her emotion? Be honest.
I love her emotion, but no.
I'm a businessperson.
(exhales deeply)
because I'm indifferent,
I'm gonna tell you this.
In life, there's only
a few moments that matter,
and clearly this is one
for you.
You have a towel
with a slit in it...
(mark chuckles)
That somebody's willing
to offer you $75,000 for.
Right.
Don't screw it up.
(chuckles) Good advice.
I am so humbled
in this moment right now,
and I thank you all so much
for hearing me,
for getting it,
for believing in me...
but in terms of going
with my heart...
I have to say,
I'm gonna go with Lori.
I'm so glad you made
that decision.
Thank you so much.
Ohh.
I'm not liking
this girl power thing.
(high-pitched voice)
Come here.
I can't wait
to work with you!
(high-pitched voice) Oh!
She was the right partner,
mark.
No. That was not
the right partner.
Thank you.
No.
You're welcome.
Ohh.
Take this check
to the Bank.
Okay. (chuckles) I promise you,
I will not let you down.
That, by the way, is a first
on "Shark tank."
She believes in you
so much, Shelly,
she's not willing to do
any due diligence.
(daymond) Yeah, that is a first.
You could be--
you could be an ax murderer,
and you'd still get that money.
She's not. I can tell.
(voice breaks) I did it.
(Shelly)
I am just thrilled beyond words.
This is incredible.
Dreams really do come True.
(voice breaks)
You can dream something,
you can believe in yourself,
and it really can happen.
