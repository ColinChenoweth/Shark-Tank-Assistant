Mr. Cuban's getting
the mavericks blue,
daymond, you have purple 'cause
I notice you wear purple a lot,
and, uncle Kevin,
you get green.
Thank you.
It's the color
of your favorite thing.
Green's the color of money.
That's right.
Wave Bye to the sharks.
See you guys.
(Robert) Bye.
This idea is exploding,
and I need your help.
I'm not just here
asking for money.
Truly, I'm looking for a mentor.
You know how to do it.
You've taken simple ideas
and made multimillion
and -billion dollar companies.
I've not one single doubt
that working together,
we could do the same.
Are you making these
at home by yourself?
Primarily, I have been
making these at home.
I've seen ponchos
like this before.
I have seen, um, towels
with a round circle in them.
The thing that I really like
about the show no
is that it lays completely flat
and it closes up.
So if you were to lay it on...
the SAND or something like that,
you would have
a complete towel.
(Lori) Did you patent this?
Yes. You know, I did not have
a lot of money to start this up.
And I just kept thinking,
"how am I gonna do this?"
and then the most incredible
thing happened.
My husband and I
were selling our house,
and a new neighbor
was moving in two houses down,
and we were having
a going-away party.
So as they're over,
we're talking and she was
complimenting my drapes--
I made custom drapes
in our house--
and I said to her,
"So what do you do?"
and she said,
"Oh, I'm a patent attorney."
A patent attorney.
And I went, "Oh, my gosh.
"This is meant to be.
This is another sign,
this is right,"
and we traded patent work
for drapes.
You traded patent work
for drapes. Okay.
Oh, you traded?
That's pretty cool.
Wow.
I have to tell you,
when I saw this idea,
I said, "This is huge.
I've got to take this big."
and then I thought,
"Okay, water parks.
That's the perfect place
to showcase this towel."
I came up with the idea
of putting the custom name
of the park on the ribbon.
Good idea.
Good, Yeah.
It's--makes
the perfect souvenir
and great advertising
for the park.
I've gotten accounts so far
with legoland california,
six flags magic mountain.
It was a hit.
How much do you
make the product for?
It costs me $6.50
to make this towel.
(mark) and you sell it
to the water park for how much,
and at retail for how much?
I sell it to the water parks
for $9
and I sell retail for $19.99.
And the water parks--
how big an order did they place?
Oh, now we just started,
so it's not huge.
My biggest order right now is
from legoland california,
and they've placed an order
for 240 towels.
So far I've sold $15,000.
(chuckles)
My name's Eric corti.
My company is
the wine balloon.
I'm seeking
a $40,000 investment
for a 30% share
of my business.
How many times have you said
to yourself,
"I'd love to have a glass
of wine tonight,
"but I'm not gonna open
that entire New Bottle just
"For one or two glasses,
because I know it's gonna go bad
by the time I'll have
a chance to get back to it."
Well, my wife and I love
red wine,
but it seems like
we've poured
more red wine down
our kitchen sink
as we've had to drink
in our house.
The reason
all that wine goes bad is
because those Primary wine
preservation devices out there
just aren't very effective.
You can pump the Heck
out of those rubber
stopper-type devices,
trying to create a vacuum,
but you can still see
half or three-quarters
of a bottle of air
still in contact
with your wine,
and the consumer doesn't even
know for sure if it's working.
I decided there must be
a better way,
so I created the wine balloon,
and here's how it works.
You lower the balloon in,
into the bottle,
till it's just
at the top surface of the wine.
You squeeze the grape cluster
to inflate the balloon.
As soon as it touches
the side of the bottle...
(chuckles)
It's completely sealed.
We say, give it
two or three extra squeezes.
Oh, that's cool.
Now that Seal is so tight,
you can turn this bottle
upside down.
That small bubble of air
in the bottom
is the only Air now
That's in contact with your wine
while it sits
on your counter like this,
in your refrigerator,
or in your wine cellar.
When you're ready
for another glass,
you just squeeze the valve here
on top of the grape cluster.
The balloon
completely deflates.
You just take it out,
rinse it off,
pour yourself another glass.
It's fantastic.
It's the wine balloon--
the wine preserver,
the only
wine preservation device
you can absolutely see
and know that it's working,
and I need your help to get it
to everyone who drinks wine.
Is this patented?
It's patent pending
right now. Yes, it is.
Okay. When--when did you file?
Eric, can I see it?
Absolutely. Pardon me?
When did you file?
How long ago?
Uh, I just filed recently.
About two months ago.
It was provisional,
and now it's a utility patent.
What is the rubber
that, uh, makes the bladder?
Uh, it is
a medical-grade latex Material.
Does it have any effect
on the taste of the wine?
It does not. It has, uh,
it gives off no taste
into the wine.
We've had it, uh, tested
in a laboratory
to, uh, confirm that--that
there's no, uh, transfer
of any flavors or--
how long do you think
it preserves?
Let's just take a Bordeaux...
mm-Hmm.
Which is very sensitive
to oxidization...
right.
And you--have you tested to see
how long it would stay fresh?
I mean, there's another system
That's very popular.
It's a shot of nitrogen gas...
mm-Hmm. Mm-hmm.
And then you Seal it.
Actually that balloon,
if you compress
an inch and a half or so
to the side of the bottle,
it will last
about three to four days,
but the beauty is,
you can squeeze it again,
if you're not gonna get
back to it.
For most people
with common sense,
they just want
to visually see
and know, uh,
that it's working.
The primary things
out there right now--
nobody can really tell.
You might say that gas is
a good preserver,
but I can't ever see it
or tell that it's happening.
Same with those pumps.
I can't really see
that there's a vacuum.
What is your background?
My background is
construction management.
Are you drinking
a lot of wine on the job?
(all laugh)
So how did you come up
with this?
Well, I have a lot of ideas.
I write 'em down
in a little spiral-Bound book
that I keep with me all
the time, that I travel with.
And how much have
you invested?
I've invested roughly $65,000
of my own money.
We just did a soft release,
uh, six months ago,
just put it up
on our web site,
with no real Advertising
or Marketing.
Sold over 700 units
to some Retailers. Um--
sold 700 units
at what price into retail?
Uh, at $22 retail price.
How--how, uh, much does it
cost you to make this?
It costs me $6.50 right now.
If you made 100,000 of 'em,
the price could be $2.50
to make them.
Very possibly.
You need a huge volume,
and there's hundreds
of thousands of the ones
that plunge air out
of the bottle sold...
right.
So here's a new idea.
We take it to that company
and say,
"Here's a better mousetrap
that replaces
your air plunging system,
which doesn't work,"
and I agree, it doesn't.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you $40,000
under one set of circumstances.
I have no interest in going
into the MANUFACTURING business
or distribution business
with you in this.
I do believe
it's a better mousetrap
to the number one selling
wine preservation device.
I'll go with you
to that company, all right,
and negotiate with you
a royalty deal,
and I'll only get 30% of what
we make in perpetuity together.
Now I'll give you
a different offer...
okay.
Because I don't agree
with Kevin.
I don't believe that
you should be licensing this
and going to a company,
because you're gonna just make
a little teeny cut.
Right.
I believe in going direct--
times a million times.
Doesn't matter.
Sure it does.
The Lion's share is in going
direct to the consumer
because That's where you're
gonna make your highest margin.
Right.
This is your baby.
That's where you're gonna
make your money,
so my offer, I'm curious,
would you be interested
if I bought you out?
Potentially.
What if I gave you $500,000?
Period.
Straight up for the company.
I own the patent.
I own the company.
You go, Lori.
Potentially.
Eric, when was the last time
you held a check for $500,000?
I have never held a check
for $500,000.
What would that do
to your life?
Uh, it would be incredible.
It would be fantastic.
So here's a chance
with just one word...
right.
Yes. How could you say no?
It's gonna change your life.
I'll tell you
how you could say no.
You could think about
two years from now,
when everybody is using
this device
the same way they're using
the air plunger,
and you'll say to yourself--
and you still won't have
a half a million-dollar check
in your pocket.
And--and you have
no more upside to it--
wait, Eric. Lori, what if
we work together,
we increase the offer
a little bit? I'll go half.
So what you say is...
we'll go to $600,000.
$300,000, $300,000.
You accept her offer,
and you say,
"look, I'll--I'll take 3%."
You got it.
Okay. Eric, I'm gonna change
the offer here.
Eric, we call him
"The undertaker,"
because he is where
businesses go to die.
So not True, of course.
What Lori and I have
just decided is,
we'll go in this together,
and we're gonna give you
a $600,000 check.
Not $500,000.
A $600,000 check.
What does he get
in the future?
He gets $600,000 to inv--
what does he get
in the future?
He gets $600,000 to invest...
a brand-new home and a yacht.
In any other great idea
that he has.
He has an opportunity
to walk--
you don't get it.
You know what that means?
Look, you have
an opportunity...
you don't get it.
To walk in to your wife
and say, "honey, guess what?
I'm successful.
"I did everything
I dreamed of.
Look at this.
A $600,000 check."
but--but, Eric, in order
for you to be able to walk up
to your wife and hand her
that $600,000 check
and have your dreams
and her dreams come True,
you have to say yes
right now.
And you know what, Eric?
Right now, Eric.
You're talking to a thief
who steals the future.
Right now, Eric.
And you're talking
to somebody...
this man is stealing
the future from you.
Who can get this on tv.
It doesn't even matter, Lori.
It's a highly
demonstrable Item.
Lori. Lori.
It doesn't matter
what she does on tv.
You won't participate
in any of that.
This is a thief.
How about we do that
with a 3% royalty?
It's not silly.
Whoa.
Yes, my man.
You're the man to know that
you have to keep your future.
Same thing.
Mark?
Always keep a taste...
mnh-Mnh.
Of your future.
Nope?
Mnh-Mnh.
That's how you get rich.
What he's talking about,
if this works, is chump Change.
He's stealing your future
from you. He's a thief.
What if we give him
2% royalty?
That's exactly what's happening.
No. No. No.
(mouths word)
We're taking all the risk.
Yes right now?
Say yes right now then...
I would,
if you accept the 3%.
Because, you know, I'll--
I'll tell you one thing.
I can't tell you how many people
have come up to me
with great ideas,
and they dickered
over, like, 1% or 2%...
amen.
Oh, I agree. Yeah.
And--and ruined the deal...
mm-hmm.
And today they're
kicking themselves,
because they're sitting
there with Nothing.
Pigs get fat.
Hogs get slaughtered.
Well, let's do that.
They're sitting there
with Nothing.
Let's not dicker over 1%,
and let's make it 2% then.
I'm out.
Oh. (chuckles)
Ohh.
Oh, look what you just did.
Ooh.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Uh, I'm--
y-you know...
take our offer.
Take the $600,000.
2% is not an option?
There is no $600,000, Lori.
Uh, he said he's out.
Mark is out.
Mark is out.
Mark, would you come
back in if he s--
(mouths word)
You better take that deal
right now.
Don't forget my offer.
You don't want
to walk out of here...
you don't seem like
that kind of a guy.
No, I understand.
I-I've had, uh--
with Nothing.
Has anybody offered you
$600,000
in a single check,
one time, bang?
Have not. Have not.
And this is
your defining moment.
Then why would you--
you should take it.
So where are we right now,
Lori?
We're at $500,000, and if Robert
wants to go in with me,
we'll be at $600,000.
No royalty.
Okay.
You wanna go 50/50?
I'm gonna be out, Lori.
(Lori) Oh.
Now you're at 500k.
Okay.
Who else is left?
Lori, and, Lori,
you can--you can back down,
too, right?
If you want to go 400k--
are you back in, if I go--
200--I'll--
okay, now you're back in.
At 400k total,
at $200,000 and $200,000,
I will go back in.
$400,000--$200,000 and $200,000.
Hang on. So wait.
We're--
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened there?
Did you go down
to $400,000?
We did, because mark decided
that we should.
If he wanted back in.
He's aggravated.
Mark are you in at $400,000
with Lori now?
Yes.
Well, daymond, would you
and Lori split at $500,000?
I see you making
stupid decisions right now,
and I don't want to be part
of that. I'm out.
So where we are, Eric,
Lori and together will buy
your company--
no debt, unencumbered.
We own it. You have
a check for $400,000.
Right.
Eric, think about
What's happened here.
In the last few minutes,
$200,000 just disappeared,
just like that.
Right.
Are you gonna let
another $400,000 disappear?
Can we make it--
(Lori) take it. Say Yes.
Can we go to--back to $500,000,
and I'll say yes at $500,000?
Say yes at $400,000.
Don't walk out of here
kicking yourself.
I made you an offer.
What are you gonna do?
You'll take--
all right. Yes at $400,000.
(mark and Lori) Done.
Congratulations.
Hey, thanks a lot.
That's the best feeling
in the world.
Congratulations.
Thank you and thank you.
Thanks a lot.
You almost went to zero.
You're right.
I almost did go to zero.
Congrats, Eric.
Thank you.
I congratulate you
on stealing his future.
Exactly.
That's what you did.
We didn't steal
his future.
You absolutely did.
We made his future.
Kevin, you're just--
you're just upset that...
his future could have been zero.
You weren't in on the deal.
I--no, no.
I was never gonna deal.
If he has kids,
they're going to college now.
I would have never done
that deal.
That's right.
That is the beauty
of the tank.
I am a little disappointed
that we didn't get it
for $600,000.
We'll take it for $400,000,
but they are sharks,
and they got a little bit more
of what they wanted,
but I'll take that $400,000
and, uh, make something happen
with it.
