My name is ivori tennelle,
from Irvine, california,
and my product is the swilt.
I'm here asking for $30,000
in exchange for 35% equity
in my company.
Now you're probably asking
yourself, "What is a swilt?"
Well, let me tell you.
The swilt is for soccer moms
sitting on cold metal bleachers.
It's for frequent fliers
in airports
who are riding in planes
and want to be comfortable.
The swilt is also for...
sports enthusiasts...
(chuckles)
Who are cheering
in the stands.
(Robert chuckles)
No longer will you have to lug
around sweatshirts <i>and </i>blankets.
I've married the two
and now they're all-in-one.
In on-the-go mode, it wears
just like a normal sweatshirt.
In head-to-toe mode,
two snaps in the front...
unhooks and converts it
into head-to-toe mode.
In head-to-toe mode,
it has a foot pocket,
and one of the wonderful things
about the foot pocket
is that it is lined
in Water-resistant nylon,
meaning if you're sitting
somewhere and it's, like, damp
or disgusting things
on the ground,
all you have to do
is wipe it off,
roll it back up,
snap it into place, and it's
right back to on-the-go mode.
I just have one question
for your guys.
Who's ready to
get comfy with me?
(Robert, Lori,
and daymond laugh)
Ivori, how many have you sold?
So far,
we've only sold 100...
That's why I'm here today.
People don't know about it,
but if they knew about it,
they would love it.
(Kevin) That's always
the problem, isn't it?
Don't you hate it
when that happens?
I know, I know, and--
so what would you do
with the money, ivori?
We need
web site optimization,
so what we'd do is
We'd change the WEB site around
so that
it's search engine-friendly,
and because I know, when
people know about his product,
we are going to sell out
of what we have--
so what we need
is more inventory.
(laughs)
You said
you're in some stores.
What kind of stores and...
Oh, no. I said we're in--
I have done, um, marketplaces,
meaning I have gone
to a marketplace and--
flea markets,
that type of thing?
Exactly, and people have said,
"you guys are too big for this."
Like, we've actually been there
and people have come up to me
and said,
"you guys are too big
to be here."
Have you gone to a store,
knocked on the door,
and said,
"Here's what I got. Buy some."?
this is the beautiful thing
about it.
No one has really seen it,
so you guys are--
you guys can take this
wherever you want to take it.
There's n--We're not
tied down to one chain
or something like that. We--
that is wonderful,
so I'm gonna offer you $35,000
of Daymond's money for 20%.
(Robert)
She only needs $30,000 Kevin.
Ivori, don't you think
it looks like a thirt--
something a 13th-century Monk
would wear? I mean, look at it.
I keep on waiting
for somebody to pop up
going, "Omm. What is..."
are you saying
it's ugly, mark?
I'm not saying it doesn't work,
ivori, but when I look at it,
I think 13Th-century Monk,
Grim reaper.
I think,
"if I put one of those on,
I fall flat on my face
'cause I trip on it."
I just can't get my arms around
it as being a success, ivori,
so with that, I'm out.
Okay, let me
tell you that--
now you came here
for daymond.
He's the fubu guy. He's done
this fleece wear thing before.
Go get him.
This is for any of you guys.
(daymond) That's right.
Let's st--
Let's start with him.
Some people are--
you know that one blanket
with sleeves that made millions?
That thing is
silly looking to me.
(Kevin) the snuggie.
(Lori) Here's the thing.
I'm very good friends with
the guys who did the snuggie.
They're
my infomercial partners.
And they have sold
billions of dollars in snuggies.
Mm-hmm.
Totally saturated
the market.
Do you see the snuggie
anywhere now?
Exactly.
No, and the reason
you don't--
but, Lori,
you could get in now.
The reason you don't
is because
the market is just
completely saturated with it...
the snuggie is dead?
You're kidding.
And the prob--
the snuggie is dead...
but What about the swilt?
And the problem is,
the swilt is really just another
iteration of the snuggie.
And for that reason, I'm out.
Ohh. Ivy, that's bad.
I would have to say
absolutely not.
This is actually mobile.
You can't take the snuggie
outside of the house
or Someone would say you were--
looked crazy, right?
You can actually
wear this out.
I don't know if it's attractive.
I wouldn't wear it.
I'm a diva and I wear it.
Ivori, there's only one path
for you to get that money here,
and it's daymond.
I'm out. Go get him.
Ivori, uh, when you roll it up
into on-the-go mode...
mm-Hmm.
As you've got it now, it looks
like you're wearing a tent.
I don't find it attractive.
I mean,
it just doesn't flatter you
and you're a good-looking woman,
so I'd lose that roll
because We're all trying
to lose our rolls,
and you've just made a roll.
Okay.
So, uh,
I hate it for that,
but we all know
that the real opportunity
is between you and daymond,
and I'm gonna hand it over
to him by saying I'm out.
Good luck with Daymond.
E's the last shark in,
and I know he loves it.
(laughs)
Daymond, do the right thing.
I think that
you have a lot of drive
and there's other things
that you'll do.
You'll learn from this
and you'll create
something else,
but I-I can't add any value
to you, so I'm out.
Okay.
(Robert) Ohh.
Good luck, ivori.
Okay, thank you.
(Lori) Good luck.
Good-Bye. Thank you.
The Snuggie's dead?
The Snuggie's dead.
Can we please hold hands
and have a moment of silence
for the snuggie?
