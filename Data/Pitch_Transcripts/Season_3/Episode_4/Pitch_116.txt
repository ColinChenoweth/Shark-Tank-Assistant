Hi. My name is Kelly Chaney.
I'm from
pittsburgh, pennsylvania,
and I'm the owner
and founder of puppy cake.
I'm seeking a $50,000 investment
for 25% equity in my business.
I used to work
for a sales and marketing firm,
and one of my clients made
cake mix for people.
As I was looking at my Client's
old cake mix advertisements,
I thought to myself,
wouldn't that be great
if they made that for dogs?
So I researched
canine nutrition,
and I eventually developed
puppy Cake.
Puppy cake is similar
to cake mix for people.
You add egg, oil, and water,
mix it, and then bake it.
Each box comes
with yogurt frosting,
and all you do to that is
add water, whip it up,
and top the COOLED cake
or cupcakes.
One box of puppy cake bakes
six cupcakes
or one 4-inch round cake.
This is Minnie.
She's a 7-year-old vizsla,
and she loves puppy Cake.
(baby talk) Minnie,
would you like a puppy cake?
(normal voice) Here you go.
That is a wheat-free
peanut butter Puppy cake
That's topped
with Our yogurt frosting.
Puppy cake is literally the best
thing your Dog will ever eat.
Why can't you just make
a regular cake?
A regular cake is not gonna
be good for a dog.
Uh, dogs have
unique digestive systems,
and we've chosen ingredients
that will be safe for dogs.
Do you have
any sales of puppy cake?
Yes, I've been doing--
Minnie.
Easy, Minnie.
Minnie, come on, honey.
You'll get some later.
I've been doing this
for about four years,
and I've had over $80,000
in sales over the 4 years.
What about last year,
Kelly?
Last year, $23,000 in Sales.
Is this through the internet,
or do you sell to stores?
I do sell to stores.
I'm at about 150 retailers,
and I am international.
I believe that this is
a very viable product,
and one reason why
I believe that
is I have done almost
no advertising in 2011,
and I've gotten some
really fantastic publicity.
I've gotten featured
in "Modern dog" Magazine,
"the bark" Magazine,
"Pet Product news
international."
Like, it's--
I've never heard
of those magazines.
Those are dog Magazines.
Dogs read them.
P-people who--
(laughs)
Kelly, do people buy it
to really make the cake
or as a novelty?
They buy it to make
the cake.
Isn't there a stretch here?
The inconvenience of having
to bake a cake for your dog...
my mother-in-Law makes
cookies for her dog.
Yeah, but...
(Robert) she does?
She does.
What percentage
of the population...
she loves her dog
like a child.
Has time to say,
"honey, let's not make
dinner for the kids.
Let's make a cake
for the dog."
(chuckles)
Actually, nestle purina did
a groundbreaking study,
and one of the facts that
they found was that
43% of dog owners celebrate
their dog's birthday.
Okay, but that's once a year.
That's True,
but do they make them a cake?
Once a year.
That could be one choice.
Um, that's one way
to celebrate a birthday.
Well, you see,
the problem with that...
the problem is...
(speaks indistinctly)
Every year you get to sell
one package to one person.
That sucks.
Well, imagine this, okay?
There are 70 million households
in the United States alone
that own at least one dog,
so if we're getting
a potential--
and every year
they buy one package?
Well, if we only get
1 1/2% of all households
who have dog owners,
that's a million boxes.
Kelly, you've been
at this for four years.
Yeah.
Why is it that you think
you've only grown it
to be able to do
$23,000 in business
over the past year?
The thing that I lack the most
is capital and connections.
I've never attended
a trade show
because I don't have
the capital for it.
I can't get
in front of distributors
unless I go to trade shows,
and that's why I'm here.
I'm seeking an investment
in order to be able
to take my company
to the next level
and attend trade--
but you could have called
distributors.
I have called distributors,
but I can't--
and what did they tell you?
I don't get
a return phone call.
Have you tried to go
to dog pet stores
and Places like that?
Have you tried to cold-call,
walk in and just say,
"would you be interested
in my puppy cakes?"
a couple times I have.
Um, sales is not really
my strong suit, and I--
I noticed.
(Robert) Ooh.
Kelly, I-I love my dog,
but I-I don't see the market.
It's a novelty. I'm out.
Kelly, you're saying
that a regular cake isn't good
for a dog, but how many dogs die
from a piece of human cake?
Not many.
Would you give your child
something that you knew
was not good for them
and that would upset
their stomach?
Yeah, but dogs aren't that dumb.
They know what they should eat
and shouldn't eat.
I don't think
there's anything
that would actually
support that.
A dog will eat, um,
they will eat something
that's bad for them
that tastes Good.
Well, I know for sure,
you can get a new dog
any time you want.
That's for sure.
(laughs)
Well, I can understand
how you may not
personally empathize
with this product.
No, I don't, actually.
You're correct,
but if I thought I could
make money, I'd be all over it.
I--
but this is a category
that I've developed
and is Growing.
Growing?
You got $22,000 in sales.
Have you done other--
I know you--you're
definitely stuck on the idea
that this is--
only happens once a year,
but I can assure you,
many of my customers buy
several times a year.
Oh, Kelly, no, no, no.
This is so wrong.
Thank goodness We've met.
I forbid you to go on.
I heartedly disagree.
Oh, my goodness.
It's insanity.
I believe that I can sell
millions of boxes
of these each year,
if I can get
a national distribution.
Minnie is speaking to me.
I can speak dog.
I'm listening, and she's saying,
"Please make her stop.
I howl at the moon for you.
Stop this madness. I'm out.
I-I'll tell you
what I think.
I-I love that you created
a birthday cake for dogs.
I think that's great.
I-I agree with Kevin that
the problem is--
is you're too limited
in your market.
People that have their dogs
love their dogs,
and they will,
I agree with you...
uh-Huh.
Spend a ton of money
on their dogs...
uh-huh.
But if you had a full range
of specialty gourmet foods
for dogs...
okay.
Which I think you should
maybe leave here
and think about...
okay.
But being just
one birthday cake for dogs,
I don't think that you're
there yet, so I'm out.
Okay.
Kelly, Kevin likes
to hear himself talk.
Unless you can sell it on qvc,
Lori just shuts everything down,
and it doesn't matter to her.
It's dead to her, so...
that's right. Encourage her.
Encourage her to go to hell.
That's so not True, mark.
(laughs)
The only place That's hell
is listening
to your nonsense.
What you have is, I think,
a good product...
thank you.
But you've had four years,
and you didn't feel like...
mm-Hmm.
Your back was
against the wall enough
to break through
your personal barriers.
Mm-hmm.
You know, you told us--
told us that
you weren't really
a salesperson.
To me, that tells me that
you aren't committed enough
to the product
to try anything.
I can't see writing a check
for somebody
who finds the excuse rather than
finds the opportunity,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
If I drop out,
you're not--
you didn't train Minnie to piss
on the carpet, did you?
(mark and Kelly laugh)
No, no. She's very Polite.
Yeah. I have two Puppies.
Uh... (chuckles)
Where I came from,
the dogs have it pretty rough.
They're usually out in the yard,
and, uh, their birthdays,
we just take the lid off
the garbage can for 'em.
(woofs)
So, uh...
(laughs)
Yeah.
And with That said...
ohh.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Well, I really appreciate
your time and your advice.
Go get 'em, Kelly.
You'll be all right.
Thank you.
Good luck, Kelly.
Later, Minnie.
(Robert) Thanks.
Today I think the SHARKS saw
my biggest weakness,
and that's where I allow excuses
to get in the way
of Making my product Successful.
