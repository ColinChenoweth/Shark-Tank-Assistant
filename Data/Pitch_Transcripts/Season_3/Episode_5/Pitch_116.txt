I don't want to
do business with Kevin.
Doesn't matter what <i>you </i>want.
It's not your business.
(chanting)
Shark fight. Shark fight.
Are you willing
to go closer?
No.
Come to daddy.
My name is
Kevin Kiernan...
and I'm Melissa Kiernan.
And we're from
waldwick, new jersey.
Every morning,
I come outside,
and there's garbage
all over the place.
So I finally put my husband,
who's Mr. Fix-it, to the test,
and told him that he needs
to solve this great mystery.
So my daughter and I
took it upon ourselves
to investigate
What was going on.
We got all geared up.
We would sit there and wait
and wait and wait,
and then we found out
the culprit--
raccoons.
And now I needed
to come up with a solution.
So we went down to
the local home hardware store
and we designed our product,
and we got
a tremendous reaction.
We're seeking an investment
from the sharks
for their resources
and their retail connections.
And also to be able to
have this put on every shelf
in the United States of America,
in every store.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Kevin Kiernan...
and I'm Melissa Kiernan.
And our product
is called the last lid.
We're seeking
a $40,000 investment
for a 20% stake
in our product.
Every day, my wife and I,
we are faced with the nightmare
of having to clean up
our own trash,
and the root
of the problem is,
is that we just don't have
any garbage can lids.
They all seem to disappear.
We don't know where they go.
Maybe the garbage man
throws them away.
Maybe the wind
blows the lid down the road
and it blows it away.
It's really disgusting and we've
been dealing with this for years
so finally I became fed up
and I said, "listen, Buddy.
"You better come up
with a solution
or find another place
to sleep."
And you know the old saying.
"A happy wife
equals a happy life."
I figured all I had to do
was go down to the local
home improvement store
and buy myself
a replacement garbage can lid.
But guess what?
To my surprise,
when I got down there,
that just was not an option.
No.
Stop the madness.
You see, the store--they want
you to buy just the garbage can,
and I only needed the lid.
So now I had to get
into macgyver mode here
and I had to
create something,
and that's why I created
the last lid!
(laughs)
Now the last lid
is a fabric replacement
for your garbage can cover.
It's made of 100%
water-resistant
polyester material, it fits
on most-size garbage cans,
and it's very simple to use.
You're gonna attach
the handles on both sides.
I've added a velcro strap
on the one side
for added strength
and security,
and then there's
a metal clasp,
which is the key
to the whole element,
that connects to the handle
on the back side.
So now guess what?
Now you never have to worry
about losing
your garbage can lid again.
And that's why I can honestly
stand here and tell you today
that this lid right here
will be the last garbage can lid
you'll ever gonna have to buy,
and that's we're calling it...
(both) the last lid!
So what's to stop a raccoon
from just peeling it right off
or gnawing right through it?
Let me just tell you--
little background for you.
I've actually videotaped
my competition.
Just like on your team,
you play the next team
the following week,
you watch a videotape, right?
Here I go.
I set up a camera in
my 8-year-old Daughter's window.
We look. We make adjustments.
We look. We make adjustments.
I've changed materials,
I've changed fabric,
I've changed designs...
so what are you saying?
A raccoon can't rip that off?
A raccoon cannot rip that off.
Nah, come on.
Raccoons get
very easily deterred.
They try to get it, they can't
get it off in a couple seconds,
they move on
to the neighbor's bin.
I know it's sounds Crazy.
Swear to God.
Always--always deterred.
Let's pretend
you're a garbage man.
Yes.
Right.
You take it off.
Here you go.
Done.
That's it. Done.
Okay, so what's--
what sales do you have?
At this time
we don't have any sales.
We've actually pretty much
finished our prototype.
We have a patent pending.
And so you haven't sold any of
'em and you're trying to offer
the value of this
is $200,000 company.
That's what your numbers
are saying.
We actually feel--
and don't laugh--
we actually feel that
that's an undervalue...
(sharks laugh)
Because the bottom line--How'd
you like that? Is that good?
(Robert) That's Good.
That's good, right?
If I do a search for
replacement garbage can lids,
what am I gonna find?
You can buy a normal
garbage can lid online...
but guess what?
For certain cans only.
This is a universal fit.
This will fit
on pretty much
90% of all the garbage cans
that are out there right now.
There's not a universal
garbage can lid?
No way.
There are none,
is what you're telling me?
No. No.
You know, the irony of it all
is that you're gonna have to do
what I did if you really wanted
to solve this problem.
All right? And that's
ultimately--I stared at it,
I looked at it, I said,
"what am I missing here?"
and then it hit me,
daymond--fabric.
Why not make a fabric
replacement garbage can?
It's universal,
it stretches,
it works--
but, Kevin,
that's an awful idea.
Then you got to clean it.
You got to wa--
That's the best part!
Rain--if it rains,
it gets wet, it gets soaked.
Yeah, what happens
when it rains?
Robert, this is
machine-washable.
I want to take something
that was on my garbage outside
into the house and clean it?
Well, you can hose it off
with a hose outside as well.
I have no interest
in this product.
Come on, Robert.
I think it's a bad idea.
Come on.
Don't bail out yet.
Listen, w-we haven't
even talked about--
licensing--
licensing This.
Look, let's go to Mr. Cuban
over here for a minute.
Congratulations on your victory,
by the way.
Wouldn't it be great to see
your team logo on this?
How many fans do you have?
On a piece of garbage, Kevin!
It's not a piece of garbage!
Yes, you want
your logo on garbage.
Come on! How do you not
see that's a bad idea?
Robert!
But I can't believe
you're gonna bail out.
You were
a stay-at-home Dad.
What's that
got to do with it?
Because I know
you've dealt with this!
I'm out.
Aw.
Lori, I know
one thing about you.
I watch you on qvc
all the time,
and I know you don't
take "No" For an answer.
You have
a can-do attitude!
(Lori) I love your passion--
Lori, come on!
I-I love your passion--
Lori. Come on!
It's a great product.
This is
a great product, Lori.
You have
a can-do attitude!
Here you go--busted.
(Lori) I love your passion--
Lori, come on!
I-I love your passion...
Lori. Come on!
It's a great product.
I understand, I relate to you,
I know what it was like,
but I can tell instantly if it's
a hero or a zero, and I'm sorry.
Really?
Come on, Lori.
I think this is a zero.
I'm out.
Ohh, Lori.
Hold on. We haven't even
talked about the market.
There's over 200 million
garbage cans sold
in the United States alone,
with 115 million households--
we already know--
look, it's a given there's
garbage cans everywhere, right?
(Melissa and Kevin) Right.
What you haven't gotten into
as you've prototyped this
is what it costs to build, what
you think you can sell it for.
Okay, let's talk about that.
Right. I mean, basically, our
production cost on this thing--
cost Per Unit's gonna be
about $3.50 a Unit.
How much you gonna sell for?
So you figure $19.95 for 2.
I don't like the numbers
right now.
7 bucks to make it. You want to
sell it at $19.95 at home depot.
They need a margin on that,
so they're gonna buy it
from you at 10 bucks.
All right? That's $3
for me as the investor and you.
Right.
That's not enough.
I'm out.
I have some of
the same issues as Kevin--
the fact that
there's not enough margin.
You don't have enough
room to invest...
right.
To take it out into retail.
Unlike Lori and Robert,
I think it's a good product,
but you're gonna have to build
this business on a slow build
as opposed to a rapid build.
Sure.
Okay.
I just don't think
it's ready to be accelerated
and--and blown up into
something really big quickly,
because of the lack of margins,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Daymond, come on.
(daymond) yeah?
If I may? Listen, seriously,
this--this is a huge issue.
We've come up with
Some staggering numbers
where at least 60% of people
Well, the numbers are staggering
in various ways.
$200,000 for the concept
of the company
is a staggering number.
The fact that
you have zero sales
is Another staggering Number.
What if I was to raise
the--the equity in the company?
I'll give you one shot.
Give me a number
and make it good.
It's on you, baby.
It's all you, baby.
We'll do the $40,000.
Let's say we came in at...
60% of our company to you.
That's better than you expected
and you know it.
Wow.
I'm in.
Whoo!
Congratulations.
Yeah!
We got the man!
Daymond! Thank you very much.
Pleasure to meet you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sharks.
Congrats, guys.
(Robert) Congratulations.
Thank you, sharks.
Thank you.
Daymond, I can't believe
you did a deal
for a fabric cover
for garbage.
You know why?
Why?
Because I was trying
to find a top for my garbage
about a month ago,
and I could not find it.
I could have sold you one
for a lot less than $40,000.
(Kevin and Lori laugh)
We thought we were done,
we thought we were finished,
and then my old man daymond
came through for us
from queens, New York.
We love you, daymond.
You're a hometown boy.
Thank you, daymond.
I'm in. All right.
Wonderful.
Right after the show,
we got together with daymond,
put together
a marketing strategy.
We went from lightfilm
to powerdecal.
Now powerdecal is a cordless
product that you can change
from one lens to the other
throughout the year.
It never quits.
Today is such a big day.
Powerdecal is
on the shelves of best buy.
Daymond was instrumental
in getting our product
placed at best Buy.
Doesn't get bigger than that.
We were able to go secure
all the major league
sports licenses--
nfl, nba,
major league baseball, nhl.
Not only that, but we have
250 different colleges.
We did it.
You got it.
All right.
Thanks.
I would say in the next
two quarters We're probably
gonna be doing at least
$5 or $6 million in gross sales.
I mean, we couldn't have
done it without "Shark tank."
This is the American dream,
this is what "Shark tank"
is about,
and it doesn't get
any better than this.
(Kevin) Okay, but daymond--
now why wouldn't they just
put a regular small Pillow
underneath them?
Because it doesn't
stay in place
and it doesn't have
the--the appropriate foam
to keep, uh, you know,
sort of the uplift.
Okay, so you've had
the patent granted? Correct?
Correct, Yes.
Which is great.
So you've got an asset there.
My concern is,
it's been three years.
Well, to be completely honest,
I am a single working mom,
and, uh, I have not had
the time or the money
to devote to the ledge Pillow
that I had hoped.
I appreciate your ingenuity.
There was a problem.
You were trying to find
a solution...
Exactly.
Which is great.
I, personally,
when I look for a product,
some of the most important
elements for me are
broad appeal
to the mass markets,
selling to
the largest audience that I can,
and I think that your product
is just too niche for me.
Well, I will tell you,
the average bra size--and I was
actually shocked by This--
is a 36dd in the U.S.
(Lori) Wow.
So that would be--
so it's just--
isn't this the essence
of your problem?
You start with a product
that only 50% of the population
will buy anyway--Women.
Then you say women with
Large breasts--smaller Subset.
Then you say women with
Augmentations--even Smaller.
It's just that the market
that needs it is too small.
(Kevin) 83.
OH.
(Kevin)
WHAT ABOUT THIS YEAR?
BETWEEN PURCHASE ORDERS
AND WHAT WE SOLD,
WE'RE AT $500,000,
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN HIT OUR BUSY
SEASON, WHICH IS FOURTH QUARTER.
WHAT IS SPIKING YOU
LIKE THAT, THOUGH?
2010, WE HAD
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
WE WERE ONE
OF OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS.
AH.
AH, THERE YOU GO.
THE OPRAH OPPORTUNITY
WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
WE HAD THIS FANTASTIC SPIKE
IN SALES, AND THEN AFTER,
WHAT WE WERE
KIND OF SURPRISED BY
IS THAT'S WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES
STARTED COMING.
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE HAD
ALL THESE DEPARTMENT STORES
AND GOURMET GROCERY STORES...
SO THE RETAILERS--
THE DISTRIBUTORS
STARTED CALLING.
AND THE RETAILERS.
THAT LED TO OUR FIRST
QVC APPEARANCE.
DID YOU SEE LORI THERE?
I DIDN'T SEE HER THERE
AT THE TIME,
BUT I CERTAINLY KNEW
SHE WAS THERE.
(Kevin) HOW DID THAT GO?
IT WAS A SUCCESS.
WE WERE JUST INVITED BACK
AND THEY ADDED FIVE NEW ITEMS.
SO THE FIRST PURCHASE ORDER
WAS FOR $20,000
AND THE SECOND PURCHASE ORDER
WAS FOR $200,000.
WOW.
SO YOU GUYS ARE KICKING ASS.
I MEAN, YOU'RE KICKING ASS
AND TAKING NAMES, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE NEED HELP
TO, UH, CAPITALIZE OUR GROWTH.
WE ARE ON
A GROWTH TRAJECTORY
AND WE'VE BEEN
DOING THIS OURSELVES,
BUT WE DON'T JUST
NEED THE MONEY.
WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
TO HELP WITH THE DISTRIBUTION.
GUYS, TALK TO ME ABOUT
YOUR MARGINS A LITTLE BIT.
ON $500,000 IN SALES
SO FAR THIS YEAR,
HOW MUCH PROFIT
HAVE YOU MADE ON THAT?
WE'RE CURRENTLY
AT A 50% PROFIT MARGIN
AND WE DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT WE'VE HIT SCALE.
BEFORE YOU PAY YOURSELVES,
RIGHT?
CORRECT.
HOW MUCH IS IT?
MOST OF THE TINS THAT YOU SEE,
UH, WITH 30 SERVINGS IN EACH,
RANGE ANYWHERE
FROM $10 UP TO $15, RETAIL.
IS THAT THE PREMIUM SIDE
OF THE TEA CATEGORY
IF I LOOKED AT OTHER PRICING?
THAT IS THE HIGHER END.
YES.
HAVE YOU TESTED YOUR PRICE POINT
TO RAISE IT UP EVEN HIGHER?
WE HAVE NOT YET.
ACTUALLY, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING THAT WE GO UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER ABOUT,
IT'S ABOUT THE PRICE POINT.
YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE HIGHER?
I TEND TO BE SOMEBODY
WHO LIKES LUXURY...
YOU WANT IT HIGHER...
(Robert) I HEAR YOU.
AND HE'S THE BUSINESS GUY.
PERFECT.
THIS IS LIKE
THE DOLCE &amp; gabbana of tea guys.
How much money
have you raised,
and is it your own money or do
you have external partners?
We've invested $300,000 of
our own money in the Business.
Wow. So you guys--
you--you believe.
We are in.
We do believe.
We do believe.
Just the 2 of you,
and you're 50/50 partners?
Yes.
So what do you do
when you disagree?
We've worked out a system.
We've worked out a system.
What's the system?
Um, I-I hate to agree
with Kevin,
but I think the Valuation
and his numbers are about
where it needs to be today.
I mean, you could prove us wrong
in two or three years,
but today that's where
I would see it.
Even at $1 million in sales
by the end of this year?
Yeah, because, you know,
you're gonna make
about $150,000, $200,000
at the bottom line.
I'm giving you full value.
I'm out.
Okay.
It's fabulous to be
an oprah gift pick,
and I know how that
jump-starts your business.
I'm not convinced that doing
this at the valuation
that you've given would be
the right deal for me,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
Come to daddy.
We would love to be
partners with you.
We really want
to get closer
to the valuation.
Then do it.
We have grown this company.
We've not just grown product.
We've grown the brand.
With qvc,
we started with one airing.
Now They've asked us
to do five this year alone.
I believe you.
The only competitor you have
right now is you.
That's right.
It's a wide-open market.
My check is right here.
I'm willing to give you
$250,000.
I want 40%, because I'm
a disciplined investor,
and you want me
as a partner.
We do want you
as a partner,
and we do think that We'd make
a great team Together.
Then let's do it.
Are you willing to go closer?
No.
This is your moment
right now.
What are you gonna do?
it's Kevin O'Leary.
I did not see that coming.
(chuckles)
I did not see that coming.
I'm so excited. Wow.
Wow, was that great.
Well, hang on. Let's hear
the offer from Mark.
(Kevin) Let's--Let's hear
the offer. Let's hear the--
okay.
Lot of noise over here.
We're gonna take 40%--I'm upping
a little bit--but I--
ouch!
Wait.
(mark) There's always a catch.
But the catch is, I am going
to personally mentor you
and help you get into qvc,
into retail stores globally.
I'll help take you everywhere,
because it is very difficult
to get into qvc,
and even more difficult
to stay on qvc.
And I hope that together,
you will have hundreds of
fabulous products you'll create.
was she's making a worse offer
than Kevin.
(Kevin) Are you gonna
make an offer or what?
She wants 40% for $300,000.
Huge value.
Now think about this.
And I gave her my mentoring,
which is invaluable.
And my connections.
And I'm gonna get your cost down
by At least 30%.
I thought you were
the silent partner.
No, I'm gonna make some noise
about this.
(laughs)
I think we can make
these things for 30% less.
So our margins go up,
you make more money,
and then you get that Ferrari
before you get a license.
(Lori) I agree.
You know, you want to be her
one day.
There's no question about that.
(chuckles)
What do you say to that offer?
I wanna hear
What else is on the table.
Good answer.
Especially
from the Dallas man.
Of course.
And daymond, our fashion guy.
(chuckles)
Well, let me clear the field.
As painful as this may be
for me to say,
there may be
some other sharks here
that would be more beneficial
to you.
I'm out.
But thank you, though.
Um, I don't want
to do business with Kevin.
It doesn't matter what <i>you </i>want.
It's not your business.
But Lori has some very specific
advantages that she offers.
So why don't Lori and I
partner up?
But 40% is being
a little bit greedy.
I think we should
take the offer back to 30%.
(Lori) All right. Done.
I'll do the deal with Mark.
Sorry, Mr. Wonderful.
Ohh.
So the offer is that
Lori and I partner in together
for $300,000, the cash
that you asked for,
for 30% of the company.
That--that's our offer
that I hope you take.
But I wanna feel
I'd like to say a few things.
Hang on a sec, Kevin.
Am I right or not?
(chanting) Shark fight.
Shark Fight. Shark fight.
What's your offer?
What's your offer?
Yes. Yes.
What's your offer?
That's the lack of enthusiasm.
Yes. Yes.
(Lori) He hit it. Okay.
Now Let's--hold on.
And then we're wide-open
to a counteroffer.
I have not had a chance
to speak, and now I'm going to.
First of all, I wanna
remind you of something.
When you build a business
like the learning company
to $1 billion dollars
and sell it for $4.2 billion,
you learn a lot.
So I'm saying that I should own
a piece of this business
for what I know,
but I'm having trouble
with the valuation metrics here.
Because I'm also
a very wise financial investor
and I know what you're worth.
However, mark dropped it down
to 30% to stay competitive.
I would do that deal again.
I'd drop it down--
it's killing me to do it,
I have to be honest--
but I'd do it for 30%, not 40%.
And maybe, Robert,
just to keep things interesting,
if you really wanna
be part of this,
include you as well.
I'll come in on that offer.
Guys, with the exception
of daymond,
you have four people
very interested.
You pretty much get to write
your own ticket.
So why don't you tell us
who you'd like to work With.
Who do you wanna work with?
Um...
