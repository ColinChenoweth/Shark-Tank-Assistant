I don't want to
do business with Kevin.
Doesn't matter what <i>you </i>want.
It's not your business.
(chanting)
Shark fight. Shark fight.
Are you willing
to go closer?
No.
Come to daddy.
My name is
Kevin Kiernan...
Hello, sharks.
My name is Kevin Kiernan...
it works--
but, Kevin,
that's an awful idea.
Then you got to clean it.
You got to wa--
That's the best part!
Rain--if it rains,
it gets wet, it gets soaked.
Yeah, what happens
when it rains?
Robert, this is
machine-washable.
I want to take something
that was on my garbage outside
On a piece of garbage, Kevin!
It's not a piece of garbage!
Yes, you want
your logo on garbage.
Come on! How do you not
see that's a bad idea?
Robert!
But I can't believe
you're gonna bail out.
You were
a stay-at-home Dad.
What's that
got to do with it?
Because I know
you've dealt with this!
I'm out.
Aw.
Lori, I know
one thing about you.
I watch you on qvc
all the time,
I have some of
the same issues as Kevin--
the fact that
there's not enough margin.
You don't have enough
room to invest...
right.
To take it out into retail.
(Kevin) Okay, but daymond--
now why wouldn't they just
put a regular small Pillow
underneath them?
Because it doesn't
stay in place
It's just that the market
that needs it is too small.
(Kevin) 83.
OH.
(Kevin)
WHAT ABOUT THIS YEAR?
(Kevin) HOW DID THAT GO?
IT WAS A SUCCESS.
Um, I-I hate to agree
with Kevin,
it's Kevin O'Leary.
I did not see that coming.
(chuckles)
I did not see that coming.
I'm so excited. Wow.
Wow, was that great.
Well, hang on. Let's hear
the offer from Mark.
(Kevin) Let's--Let's hear
the offer. Let's hear the--
okay.
Lot of noise over here.
We're gonna take 40%--I'm upping
a little bit--but I--
ouch!
Wait.
(mark) There's always a catch.
But the catch is, I am going
to personally mentor you
was she's making a worse offer
than Kevin.
(Kevin) Are you gonna
make an offer or what?
She wants 40% for $300,000.
Huge value.
Now think about this.
Um, I don't want
to do business with Kevin.
It doesn't matter what <i>you </i>want.
It's not your business.
But Lori has some very specific
advantages that she offers.
I'd like to say a few things.
Hang on a sec, Kevin.
Am I right or not?
(chanting) Shark fight.
Shark Fight. Shark fight.
What's your offer?
What's your offer?
Yes. Yes.
What's your offer?
That's the lack of enthusiasm.
Yes. Yes.
(Lori) He hit it. Okay.
