I'm Steve nakisher...
and I'm Shane Talbott.
We're from chicago, illinois.
Steve and I have been together
for the last 15 years,
and for the last ten
we have been business partners.
So what are we
gonna do today?
I'm a hair colorist,
and my experience in that world
has really taught me
how to pamper people.
As a psychologist, I find it's
so important to teach my clients
to relax, to take a moment
to take care of themselves...
and we realized that
this was our opportunity
to put our passions together,
and our product is amazing,
because it really adds that
touch of elegance and luxury
to Somebody's day.
And it gives people
an opportunity
to slow down
and take a break.
If we don't get a deal
from the sharks,
it would be like
the death of a dream,
and I hate
to see that happen.
I've put so much of my heart
and passion into this,
I hate to see that go.
I'm Steve nakisher,
and this is Shane Talbott.
Our company is called
Talbott teas.
We are seeking $250,000

TOGETHER INDULGENT INGREDIENTS
TO CREATE

BEVERAGE IN THE WORLD.

YET UNINSPIRED.

(Robert) WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
TODAY, SHANE?
IN 2009,
WE HAD $100,000 IN SALES.
IN 2010,
WE HAD $350,000 IN SALES.
I win.
Shane is always right.
(all laugh)
He's all creative,
I don't step on his toes,
and I do the business side,
and he doesn't step on my toes.
Shane, what's the big plan?
Tell me the next five years.
If I give you $250,000,
what's the plan?
The Big plan is,
this is just the beginning
of a lifestyle brand.
I would really like to see
more of the accessories,
some tabletop, there could be
some licensing down the road.
What's the exit strategy?
How do I get my money back?
It will be a liquidity event.
We will sell this company
for four or five times earnings.
You <i>do </i>know
what you're talking about.
We agree that we can grow this
to $100 million in--in revenue.
I think this is an incredible
story, but unfortunately,
I'm already in that space
as an investor,
and so I'm conflicted out.
I wish that I was doing the deal
with you instead,
'cause I'm losing my shirt
in the other space.
You would not
lose your shirt with us.
I-I know, but I can't, 'cause--
due to conflict, so I'm sorry.
Regretfully, I have to be out.
Guys, I'm a big fan
of what you're doing, too,
but I live, eat,
and sleep my businesses,
and I couldn't eat,
sleep, and breathe tea.
So I wish you the best--
I think you can be
a $100 million business--
but I'm out.
Daymond, you said
something that concerns me,
'cause I'm thinking
of their story.
You mentioned that you'd made
an investment in a tea company
and lost your shirt.
What happened?
I think the guy running it
is a bozo.
These guys--
and I-I didn't know
enough about it
to get into it,
and I'm trying
to off-load it now.
I think this is a great space.
That's why I got in it.
You know, caffeine is the number
one drug in the world,
and they're selling it.
Well, what I like
about this story is,
although the Category's
not growing,
it's also recession-proof.
People that drink tea,
drink tea.
True.
Tell you
what I'm gonna do.
Um, I like the story,
I like what you guys are doing,
but I don't like the value.
You know, it's one
of those not-easy deals,
which always troubles me,
'cause viscerally I love
to just say "Buy it."
go with that feeling.
(laughs) Yeah.
Go with that feeling.
Trust your instincts.
It's so compelling.
I have an offer for you.
$250,000, but I want 40%.
Negotiate.
I'm wondering if there's
any other offers on the table.
I don't know, guys.
I love the product.
You guys are great.
