Hi. My name is Maddie Bradshaw.
I'm 15 years old,
and I'm the President
of M3 girl Designs.
Hi. My name is Margot Bradshaw.
I'm 11, and I'm the V.P.
Hi. My name is Diane Bradshaw.
I'm their mom,
and we don't need
to disclose my age.
(sharks chuckle)
We're asking for $300,000
in exchange
for 15% of our company.
M3 girl designs,
a jewelry company
for girls ages 8 to 80,
started in 2006,
when I was just 10 years old.
The "M3" Stands
for Maddie, Margot, and mom.
It all started when I was
going into middle school
and wanted magnets
to decorate my locker,
but I couldn't find anything
that I liked,
and in my house, if we can't
find what we want, we make it.
So I made my own magnets out
of recycled bottle caps
from my Uncle's
old-fashioned Coke machine.
I drew up
some Really cool designs,
like peace signs, balloons,
and flowers.
I put them into the bottle caps,
and I attached a magnet
to the back.
My friends saw them,
loved them,
and started going crazy,
so I figured I came up
with a pretty awesome idea,
so I eventually created
snap caps--
the original interchangeable,
magnetic bottle cap Necklace.
Thanks, Margot.
Mm-Hmm.
Thank you.
Go, Mavs.
Go, mavs.
(Diane) go, Mavs.
That's what I like.
(laughs)
(bradshaws chuckle)
(Maddie)
So I took my snap caps
into a local toy store
in Dallas,
and I asked the owner
if she would start selling them.
Within two hours,
they had sold out
of all of our bottle caps
and necklaces,
and that's when my company,
M3 girl designs, was born.
I'm the vice president,
and that means
when the president goes down,
the vice president has
to step up.
(sharks laugh)
You know, Maddie's going
to college in a few years,
and I'll have all--I'll have
all of this to myself.
(mark and daymond laugh)
now that I'm 15 and Margot is
helping me with snap caps,
I decided that I wanted
a new jewelry LINE
geared toward my age group,
so my mom and I created
spark of life.
Spark of life is
adjustable necklaces
and stackable bracelets
for kids and adults of all ages.
Have you been selling these yet?
We've been selling
for about five years now,
and we're in
over 1,000 stores.
You're in 1,000 stores?
What? Whoa.
We're all over the Nation.
Yes.
And what are
your sales at now?
Well, over the past 5 years,
we've hit over $5 million.
(sharks) Whoa!
Dang. (chuckles)
That's not too shabby.
What were your sales last year?
Our sales last year were
about $1.6 million.
(laughing)
(chuckles)
and where were you selling?
What stores?
Uh, we sell to specialty stores,
So apparel stores, toy stores,
a lot
of large department stores.
What was your profit?
Our--
um, $1 million.
So, Maddie,
you're a millionaire.
I guess you could say that.
At 15. (chuckles)
Wow.
(chuckles)
Dang.
She's also an author.
Mm-hmm.
An author? What do you write?
Yes. Um, I wrote my own book
to inspire other kids
to start their own business.
Can I see the book?
Yeah.
How did you find
these 1,000 retailers?
Like, do you have
a distributor?
Well, we started off in just
a few local stores in Dallas,
but then, um,
we just were approached
by more and more stores,
and then we got a sales rep,
and now I think we have about
ten reps that sell our--
mm-hmm.
And where do you make them?
Do you make them all
in your house or--
they're all handmade
in our office in Dallas.
Your first line, you said,
was the bottle caps,
and that's what's
made for you
the $5 million in sales,
correct?
Yes.
Right.
And then you are now going on
with what you feel is
for an older, uh, girl...
yes.
A more mature girl.
We're a company.
We're not a one-hit wonder,
so for us, it's always about
introducing the next thing.
What are your margins?
Um, snap caps,
about 75 cents,
and, um, spark of life,
around $2.
Good Margins.
Who owns the business?
I mean, structurally.
Do you guys all own it
together?
Yes, we do.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Including--the girls have
ownership equity in it?
Absolutely.
One question that
I think is important--
in this economy, jewelry has
been a very tough sell,
so how do you feel that
that has affected you
and your sales?
It's a $10 piece of jewelry.
(speaks indistinctly)
Is everything
at that price point--around $10?
The most expensive thing
is $10.
Hey, Maddie, why do you need
the money
if you made $1 million
last year?
You're asking for $350,000.
Am I missing something?
Um, well, we want it
for global distribution.
We're looking for a partnership
to take us to the next level.
So here's what I think.
For 300k...
I'd do a deal
for 30%.
Okay, I'm--I'm gonna
make you an offer.
Okay. (chuckles)
What I would like to do is,
I would like to go in
with Mr. Wonderful here...
ah.
And...
what?
Yep. I'm gonna go in
with Mr. Wonderful.
Are you okay, Lori?
I-I--yes, I'm having a moment.
I'd be happy to have
your partnership...
I'd like to go in
with Mr. Wonderful...
because of your talents
on television.
Except he needs to be
a silent partner,
and the silence starts now.
(laughs)
See how nasty she can be?
And what I'm going to do--
well, before you guys
decide anything--
So, Maddie, Maddie, there's
a lot of hot air up here...
(laughs)
But at the end of all
of that wonderful mentoring,
Margot, you guys haven't
heard from me yet...
(Diane) Yeah.
And that's intentional.
that Maddie feels that this is
a wonderful opportunity
That's just come your way.
I'm looking for that enthusiasm,
that excitement.
But we haven't heard
from Robert, either.
Know what? I'd like to speak,
'cause I haven't finished...
well, hang on a second.
With my offer, 'cause you're not
in this thing right now.
So let's just--
no, no. Hang on. I <i>am </i>in
this thing for a second.
What do you want?
I don't think Maddie Wants
to give up 30%.
Correct.
Yes. Yes.
(Robert) Diane, there's
no secrets in the family!
You're not "the family" Yet.
(mark laughs)
(speaks indistinctly)
(Lori laughs) I'm not in yet.
I love that.
(mark) Margot's great.
It's a huddle.
(Margot speaks inaudibly)
No.
No.
Okay. Never mind.
I'm good.
(whispers indistinctly)
Okay.
(speaks indistinctly)
Three sharks,
but...
we want Robert, Lori, and mark.
Big mistake.
And at what percentage?
20%.
20%?
Ooh.
(Maddie) Nothing more.
Nothing more?
Nothing more.
(Lori) Mm. I think 20%...
is Low.
(Robert) Maddie, I wanna stick
to the 30%.
(whispers indistinctly)
Okay. We will--
(speaks indistinctly)
tell me.
(all laugh)
Margot, that always happens
when you're the youngest.
(Lori laughs)
(speaks inaudibly)
Fine.
Okay, you have the offer
on the table.
(Lori) What are you thinking,
Maddie?
30%, but we want season tickets
for mavs games.
(Lori laughs) Good one!
Good one!
Margot, get a pair for me.
Ask for...
(laughs)
You can do it.
Come on, mark.
You own the team.
(laughs) Hey!
Please?
I'd give you season tickets,
but we're all sold out.
But any time you wanna come sit
in my suite and hang out
and bring the whole family,
bring friends, done.
So, mark, are you in?
$300,000, the 30%,
Robert, Lori, and I.
Yes. Yeah.
Deal?
Deal.
Deal. Done.
(Robert) Done. All right!
(laughs) Margot...
(speaks indistinctly)
god, I love...
(speaks indistinctly)
Awesome! Nice job!
Yes, you, too.
I got screwed out of that one.
They ran you over, man.
Maddie, great job.
Thank you.
(all speaking at same time)
(Diane) Oh, thank you, guys.
See you guys soon.
(Diane and Maddie) Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, guys. Great job!
Amazing.
(exhales deeply)
(all laugh)
That 15-year-old kid got
$300,000 from mark, Lori, and I.
$300,000, tickets in a box,
and ran over you like
the flea-bitten scurvy dog
you are.
(laughs)
I'll getcha back, big boy.
I know you will.
Don't worry about that.
Well, at least you'll try.
Good job, man.
Good family, good people.
I can't believe that we got
to pick our own partners.
I never would've thought that
that would happen.
We--I thought we were gonna
be lucky enough
to get a deal from <i>one </i>shark,
and we got <i>three </i>with us,
so that's great.
I'm really excited.
