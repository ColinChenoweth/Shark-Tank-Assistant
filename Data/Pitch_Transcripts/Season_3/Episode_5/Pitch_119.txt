My name is Amanda schlechter
and I invented the ledge Pillow.
I'm asking for $30,000 for
a 25% interest in my company.
My beautiful model Martina
will hand them out
so you can take a look
at 'em up close.
Thank you, Martina.
The ledge Pillow is
a fully patented
WEDGE-type Pillow,
specifically for women
with Breast implants
or just large breasts, to lay
on their stomach comfortably.
(sharks chuckle)
it is the only wedge-type Pillow
on the market
for women with Implants
or with Large breasts
to just lay on their stomach.
I had an AUGMENTATION myself
and I couldn't sleep
on my stomach anymore.
So I went
to the fabric store,
borrowed my mother's
electric turkey-carving knife,
and began to carve out
the design
that you see patented here.
Who knew we had
this big problem?
It's a problem.
Thank goodness.
I knew this was one
that the guys would want
to get their hands on.
How many women
have this problem?
How many women would you say
have breast implants?
Well, there are
5 to 10 million women worldwide
that have breast implants.
What? Really?
That many.
What about
naturally large breasts?
Absolutely.
This--this--
what size increment
do we have to get to
before the wedge Pillow
becomes a factor?
"C" Cup and above, uh, really
would need the ledge Pillow.
And how high can you go
in the alphabet?
Well, to be honest with you,
I think bra Sizes go up
to sort of double-k.
In--in the U.S.--
Wow.
What?
Amanda, would this work
on a double-k?
Yes. The idea is to minimize
compaction here. It's not just--
I'm trying to
visualize a double-k.
I bet you are.
Okay. Ignore these guys.
No, no, this is important.
(Lori) Have you sold
any of these?
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, absolutely.
How many?
I've only sold 83 of them.
83?
Yes, 83 of them.
I only had a WEB site up,
uh, since 2008...
(Lori) 2008.
So it hasn't been
very long, and--
since 2008?
3 years? You've been selling
for 3 years and you sold 83?
I have absolutely no money
for advertising, so--
no kidding.
(sharks laugh)
It could be
a fabulous product,
but if you can't
let people know about it...
let me ask you something.
Women with Big boobs--
do they sleep on their stomach?
Sure.
Or do they--do they,
over a course of time,
realize that hurts,
and they sleep on their backs?
Well, they sleep
on their backs now
if they don't have
a ledge Pillow.
Well, because most of the guys
up here are married.
I happen not to be,
so I've had the pleasure of...
being with more than one woman
in the last 50 years.
And how much
did that cost you?
(laughter)
Uh, way less than
it's costing you guys, trust me.
And usually they sleep
on their back or their side.
That's because
they don't have a ledge Pillow.
Then it get worse, Amanda,
much worse--
Only women that want
to sleep on their stomachs.
Now we're down
to a universe of 83,
and you've met 100%
of the market with your sales.
It's over.
Why don't you tell her
what you really think?
You know what?
You're so nasty,
and at the end of the day,
you and I are very similar.
We'd make very good partners.
But it's a nightmare,
as you found out.
You have lived a nightmare
since you brought this out.
You've sold 83 Units.
This product is not going to
make anybody here any money.
And Lori can be very nice to you
and say that in a different way.
At least with me
you get the truth.
It's a dog. Stop wasting
your time with this. I'm out.
I'll give you some advice.
What I think you should do first
is change the name
to something that has "Boob,"
"Breast," something in it,
but because it doesn't have
a broad mass appeal,
I'm--I'm out.
Amanda, you're not
dealing with the facts.
In 3 years, selling 83
is such a small amount.
Women would have found you
if there was a demand for it.
I'm out.
You guys are my last hope.
I don't know
how to market to this area,
and you don't either...
unfortunately.
It's not my Area.
That's why I'm standing here.
I respect that,
but I-I can't add any value
to you, so I'm out.
You want this
to be a company,
but you don't want it bad
enough, and that's the problem.
You just tell me
what to do, and--
that sounds Good.
It's the truth.
It's--it's the truth.
But it's not.
It's not,
and I'll tell you why.
You're not gonna be a person
where if I write you a check
for $30,000,
I can trust
that you're gonna go out there
and just bust your Butt.
You have to do what you have
to do to be successful,
and I don't see you doing that,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Well, thank you for your time.
Everything's
a learning experience,
so I will respectfully take your
comments, so I do appreciate it.
(sharks laugh)
(Robert) Yeah, you were right,
mark. Not the dedication.
Just a product.
Just a bad product.
I don't think
it's a bad product.
