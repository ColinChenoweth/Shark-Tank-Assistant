I own the mavericks, right?
Yes.
We could sell those
in our Arena.
Absolutely.
Did you know that I own
landmark theatres?
Absolutely.
We can sell those
all across landmark theatres.
I'm prepared to give you
$100,000 for 25%
if you're ready
to say yes right now.
Wh--
you <i>better </i>say yes right now.
Yeah, you better say yes.
I'm ready to say yes right now.
Done.
Wow.
(Robert and Lori sputter)
Congratulations.
gonna be at the maverick games
and landmark theatres.
It's like a dream come True.
(squeals)
I just love mark Cuban's
business savvy,
but his personality
is just adorable,
so I'm so excited
to work with him.
It's Dallas Mavericks blue
just for you.
That's okay.
You keep it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mark, are you allergic to
positive-negative ion stuff?
No, I'm allergic to scams.
Seriously. This is not new.
It's been disproven.
What you saw
is the placebo effect.
There's athletes that wear it.
It's a joke. It's a scam.
It's not real. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
What do you <i>really </i>think,
mark?
I think it's a joke,
it's a scam, and I'm still out.
Well, what I want to know--
are you selling any of these?
Sales from a $10,000 investment
were $120,000 in just 12 months.
Okay, so some people
are buying them.
That's--have you made
any money on the $110,000?
I have. We have about
$70,000 in Profit.
Really?
Do you pay
to acquire your customers?
How are you getting them?
No, my background is in
search engine optimization,
so we are the top of
all the organic search results.
I like that.
We--we don't spend
anything in marketing
other than my time that
I dedicate with my background.
So you're basically getting
your customers for free.
Correct.
How do you get the negative ions
in this rubber band?
When We're melting the silicone
into the molds,
we put the negative ion chemical
into the silicone.
With a wand?
(laughs)
You're saying they constantly
emit out of here.
How do you know
when they run out?
I mean--
it--has a net charge.
Do you have
laboratory testing on this?
Independent Laboratory testing
that shows that it really works?
<i>Hell, </i>No. <i>Hell, </i>No.
Laboratory testing?
Yeah.
That's what he needs to have.
Okay.
I mean, to be able
to sell something like this
on any tv medium whatsoever,
you have to have
independent laboratory testing
that shows your claims.
Otherwise, the f.T.C.'s
gonna be all over you.
No, we don't have anything.
It's a common thing--for
positive ions and negative ions.
We're just neutralizing
the effects
of the positive ions.
It's been around for years.
I've got to say, I think
this is a liability nightmare.
You don't have any claims that
you can back up, so I'm out.
And so you created this watch?
This design--I didn't
originate the design.
My other two designs
are my own original design.
So you're saying that
you already purchased
the first watch That's shown,
but you designed
the other two?
Yep.
I helped take a company
called rumbatime,
and they have
the exact same line,
so you're lying.
And with that, I'm out.
Are you lying?
No. W-which design?
Which are you referring to?
All three.
No, those are--
the bottom two are unique to me.
I designed those.
The other one is a--
I'll ship you a box.
Well, more than one person
can make a watch like that.
I mean, a lot of people make
the same design all the time.
I feel one
with the ion right now.
(laughs)
I'm just trying to figure out
if I can make any money
on this deal.
Kevin, I'm gonna warn you.
If you even try to make money
from this, I will come over
and just beat the living crap
out of you. It's horrible.
(laughs)
My name is Rick Hopper,
and my business is readerest.
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 15% of my company.
I <i>hate </i>losing my glasses.
Like many people, I'll spend
up to $500 on quality eyewear,
and the wasted time
and high cost
I've talked to 1,000 people
who share
the same exact frustrations
with losing, dropping,
and scratching <i>their </i>glasses.
The most common
solution people use
are these granny chains
and ropes
that hang around our neck.
They're annoying
and they look goofy,
and nobody wants to be
a goofball or a granny.
Another option--we hang
our glasses in our shirt,
stretching out our collars.
The next thing you know,
your glasses are in the toilet!
Have you ever had to fish
anything out of the toilet?
I have,
and it's not pretty, bro.
But now there's hope.
I call it readerest.
Here's how it works.
Take the stainless steel
back plate embedded with Magnets
hidden under your clothes.
Stainless steel front clip
easily self-centers
onto the back plate.
You simply hang your reading
glasses or your sunglasses.
Bam. Check it out.
I can jump around,
swing a golf club,
bend over all I want,
and they're not going anywhere.
Matter of fact,
I can take a major tumble,
and there they are,
safe and sound as usual,
right where I left 'em
and always within Arm's reach.
I brought samples so you can
feel the power of readerest.
Got a special one for you.
Oh, thank you--
ohh, mine has diamond.
(Robert) Thanks.
(Robert) Real diamonds?
(Lori) Well, you know...
(Robert)
It's a strong magnet, Rick.
(Lori) Yeah.
So Rick, uh, $160,000
is what you said, for 15%?
$150,000 for 15%.
So Rick, honey,
sweetie, poopsie,
you must have a lot of sales.
(sighs) Well...
actually, uh, I started
doing sales in the beginning.
I was able to generate $65,000
in sales in a market test mode,
but here's what happened.
Because I was burning
through inventory so fast,
I had to go back
into production mode
for the last couple of months.
Do you make these yourself?
Yes.
Actually, I, uh, have personally
hand-glued over 100,000 magnets.
Come on. You--really?
(Lori) You're kidding.
This is not made
in a factory anywhere?
No. No. Actually, I have
a little, uh, little, uh, shop.
How much do you sell this for?
Uh, they retail
for between $9.99 and $19.99.
For one set?
Wow.
That's a lot of Money.
Uh, Yes. Actually,
neodymium magnets aren't cheap.
Uh, it's a high-quality
Stainless steel...
right.
And there's
labor involved,
and you guys know how much
packaging costs, so--
well, how much
does it cost you to make one?
It costs me a buck and a Nickel
for the basic ones
and around $2
for the--the one--
with the most of
the swarovski crystals on 'em.
How did you come up
with this?
Well, what I did was,
I started bending paper clips
into different shapes.
I have a--one of my originals
right here, one of my favorites.
Paper Clips bent
into different shapes,
and, uh,
epoxied 'em to magnets,
put a piece of metal
under my shirt,
and I was in business.
And shazam--
old Jed's a millionaire.
Nine months later,
I realize I got pestered
every day by several people,
"How are your glasses
staying on your shirt?"
and by the time I explain it to
'em, they're like, "Oh, my gosh.
Where do I get one of those? I
can't keep track of my glasses."
Is there a patent on this?
Yes, sir.
I have a, uh, utility patent
and a registered trademark
on readerest.
I-I bought the patent
from the original Owner.
B-but What did your--you know--
I thought you said
you invented it.
I thought--Yeah.
(daymond) huh?
I did. I did. Let me explain.
I designed the product.
I went--I started getting
a lot of interest,
so I went to do
a patent search...
okay.
And was extremely disappointed
to find the patent--
it was already done.
Did a little research...
so you own the patent?
(daymond) So you got it?
So you bought it?
You bought the Pat--
I went and secured the patent.
I own the patent.
This is all happening
so fast--
what did you pay for it?
$5,000.
Ohh.
You found the guy who invented
it. You paid him $5,000.
Yes.
And you own it free and clear?
Free and clear.
So Rick, Rick.
I would say to you,
I acquired a patent for $5,000,
but I'm gonna value my company
to you at a million dollars.
You see anything wrong
with that?
Yes, absolutely.
You know, no investor
likes to speculate
and take risks at that level,
and I completely
understand that,
and my argument to that
would be,
in a very short period of time,
with very little effort,
I generated $65,000 in sales.
The potential--
when I'm in 5,000 stores,
it equates to $6 million a year
in gross profits,
and one of the reasons I'm here,
it's a strategic partner,
and I'm willing to give
more percentage of my company.
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
We have to give you the $150,000
and then we have to work, too.
(laughs)
No. No, you don't.
Actually, I actually--
with your connections--
information is the most valuable
commodity in the world.
So now you want us
to give you the money,
work, and then pass off
our connections.
Yes. Actually, n--
and I am out.
Here's the thing.
I have a question.
You're not a salesperson.
Would you say that's
not really your strength?
I'm--I wouldn't consider mys--
I'm a--I-I create things.
I've been designing little
things since I was 13 years old.
So you're an inventor,
but maybe not a good marketer?
True.
Good salesperson?
So you really need somebody
who will come in
and take over
and make this work for you.
Exactly.
Okay. I'm--I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'm gonna make you
an offer for...
$150,000,
but I need 65% of the company.
(sighs)
and I'll get this on tv
and I'll blow out--
I'll make you a millionaire.
'cause I--
the minute you walked in here,
I knew that this was a Winner.
I think it's a great product...
thank you.
And I want to help you
to make this a huge success,
but I think you need
someone like me.
This sitting on a store shelf--
it's just gonna sit and die.
You need somebody Who's
going to show this all the time,
and tv's the perfect medium
to show this.
The product demonstrated--
it brings it to life.
You're right, the product
sitting on a shelf like that,
it's--retail would be--
I believe retail will be
a difficult avenue
for this product.
However...
um... the P--
well, I have the background
in which to get this
to infomercial and on tv,
so are you in or are you out?
Is that my only offer?
(chuckles)
Are you in or are you out?
I'd like to counter.
What are you countering?
I'd like to consider...
I would like you
to consider, um,
49% of the company.
No.
I'm a little--
I'm a little gun-shy
in Giving up total controlling
interest of the company
without a complete buyout option
with Royalties.
All of a sudden you got smart.
Oh, he just became
a businessman.
Whoa. How'd that happen?
I think he was
always a businessman.
Well, I-I did design some--
you seemed a little scattered,
my friend,
and all of a sudden,
when money comes to the table,
you get crystal Clear.
Look, Rick, now that we're
talking about real money,
let me tell you where I stand.
At best, I saw this
as a knickknack
that was sold at gas stations
and places like that.
I'm not seeing the value
that Lori is.
I'm out.
Okay, Robert.
I look at it and say,
a $1 million valuation
for a little piece of metal
with two magnets on it?
That's sheer insanity.
I'm out.
Mark, what are you doing?
I'm processing.
While he's processing,
I want you to give me an answer.
Are you shutting out cuban?
Before he speaks again.
Wow.
I need an in or out.
This is brutal.
Lori, can I please have
just one second here?
'cause I would love
to do business with you,
but this company is gonna
make a lot of Money.
Well, here's the thing. I'm
gonna make you a lot of money.
Let me help you. Let--let me
help you. Let me help you.
Wait, mark, wait.
I'm gonna make you
a lot of money.
I'm gonna get this on tv.
You know I have the audience.
You know I have
millions of viewers
that already watch my show
on qvc.
Rick, baby,
is this not your moment?
I know. I know.
So they love everything
that I bring them.
This is my one big chance.
I love this...
This is perfect for--
but--
wait, Rick. Feel the Karma.
Feel the Karma.
What a moment.
What a moment--
take it, grab it,
'cause I could walk.
Can I please hear
What mark has to say?
(Kevin) ooh!
You know what?
(Robert) Wow.
If I walk, you lose the tv,
and the tv isn't easy for mark.
Actually, I own two tv networks,
so that's not the problem.
Yeah, but they're not--they're
not home shopping Networks.
Remember that.
But I'm--I'm gonna help you,
Rick, 'cause I like you.
I'm--I'm gonna help you, Rick,
'cause I like you.
There are better options,
and for that reason, I'm out.
Ooh, and then there was one.
Yes.
And there was one.
So it was $150,000
for 65% of the company.
Would you consider...
that's--
take it
or leave it.
Is that your
flat dead only offer?
It's my flat dead,
but you're gonna be happy.
(sighs)
Rick, baby. What do you do?
You know, 35%...
of a watermelon.
Of $10 million
is very exciting to me.
And it beats gluing them
in your garage.
You're not gonna
have to do anything
but sit back
and watch the money roll in.
Lori, you got a deal.
I'd love to do this.
Great.
Wow.
Congrats, Lori.
Congrats.
Thanks. Great Idea.
Thank you.
(kisses)
Very cool, Rick.
Thank you, guys.
It's been a--been a blast.
(mark) Congrats.
Piece of metal with Two magnets
just got $150,000.
Congratulations.
What are you gonna do?
(Lori)
That's America for you.
(Robert)
That <i>is </i>America for you.
That's America.
Just watched a guy
go from zero to a millionaire
in the shark tank.
(sighs)
(Lori) Right.
(mark) Congrats.
Let's rock, Lori.
We're gonna rock.
Thanks, guys.
Wow.
Look at that.
Whoo-hoo!
This guy took $5,000
and made it a million-dollar
idea in less than six months.
Have you ever done <i>anything</i>
with eyeglasses?
Actually, I've sold
over $20 million worth
of reading glasses.
So you can
just bundle this...
so I can just bundle this
with some readers.
As soon as he walked in here,
you knew that. We had no chance.
(laughs)
Mark, can we switch seats?
35% of my company is--is not
what I wanted to be left with,
but when Lori looked
right into my eyes
and said, "I'm gonna
make you a millionaire,"
I believed her.
