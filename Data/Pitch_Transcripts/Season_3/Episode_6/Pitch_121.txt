My name is Raven Thomas
and I live in Gilbert, arizona.
(groans) hold on tight.
I've been married for 11 years,
and I have 2 boys.
After I had
my second boy, Aaron,
I decided that
I really wanted to be home,
so I gave up my career
in criminal intelligence
to be the mom
that I always wanted to be.
I was really enjoying
being a stay-at-home mom
and started, um,
getting creative in the kitchen
and decided to give out
chocolate-covered pretzels
as christmas gifts,
to save a little money.
People really loved them
and they encouraged me to keep
making them and even sell them,
so I decided to go for it,
and within, like, three months,
I had massive orders
that just blew my mind.
I just didn't know
what to do with Them.
Hey. How are you?
Hey, Raven.
Good. How are you?
Got some more pretzels
for you.
Excellent.
I got so many orders,
that I could not even
stay in my kitchen anymore.
I had to go and find
a rented kitchen
and get people to help me,
but the problem was,
I didn't have money
to pay for anyone,
so my mom and my sister
came to help me.
Looks good, looks good.
I need the sharks' help
because I continue
to get a lot of orders
and there's just no way
I can keep up with them.
I need the capital
to make the product.
And I'm afraid
if I don't get the sharks' help
I won't be able
to produce the orders
and I'll just lose my business.
My name is Raven Thomas
and my company
is the painted pretzel.
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for 25% of equity.
I started the painted pretzel
almost three and a half
years ago
after leaving
a career that I loved,
to become a stay-at-home mom.
People loved them so much,
they suggested that I sell them.
I could keep describing them,
but how about you just try them?
And I think you'll be hooked.
Oh, yeah.
Bring 'em on.
(Lori laughs)
What makes the painted pretzel
So amazing
is that our pretzels come in
unlimited flavor combinations.
We coat our pretzels
in many types of chocolates,
from white, dark, milk,
to butterscotch,
peanut butter, and mint,
and then top them
with unique toppings
like Candy bars,
nuts, and even fruit.
Oh, wow.
Mmm.
Mmm.
This is fantastic.
Mmm!
I'm here because I would
really like a strategic partner
and I need the investment.
We've had a great start,
but it's nowhere near
Its full potential
and I could really
use your help.
The painted pretzel is fun,
it's yummy, it's unique,
it's working,
and most importantly,
it's positioned to make
both of us some serious cash.
So who's ready?
Raven, give us
some numbers on sales.
Over the last 12 months,
we've done about $75,000.
We just got another order in
last week for $64,000.
And not only that--
I have $140,000 worth of orders
that I did not have
the capital to Fill.
Who was that with?
We have neiman Marcus,
we're in, um, Sam's club,
Stein mart, airports--
how long? For how long
have you been in those places?
This is our fourth season
in neiman Marcus.
We've sold out in some
of their stores in one day,
online in less than a week.
You said your typical order from
a large retailer is $60,000...
mm-hmm.
But your total sales last year
were $75,000.
Did I hear that correct?
You heard that correct,
but we also--
I also have a $140,000
that I was not able to fill.
Okay, Raven,
the thing that's troubling me--
and I think you're gonna
have to answer this now...
okay.
There's many,
many pretzels on the market
with chocolate on 'em.
Right.
There's nothing unique.
So the question is,
for the painted pretzel,
what's different,
what makes you any better,
and why are you gonna
be able to survive
if there's nothing unique
about what you do?
Our--our product is just--
is based on awesome ingredients
and quality of ingredients,
the style, the packaging--
makes us totally unique
to the market.
You will not find another one
even comparable to us.
What do you sell
that rou--larger round tin
to neiman Marcus for?
Um, $14.50.
$14.50, and it costs you
how much to make it?
Um, just under--
like, around $7. $7.
$7 to make.
What I'm really curious about is
you're selling it to neiman's,
but how many times a year
do they order?
Um, they order
a couple times in the fall
and then they'll
do it again in the spring.
How many stores
are they putting these in?
In every one of their stores
and Online. They're--
what flavors
are they ordering?
An assortment.
They don't decide
what's in it. I do...
got it.
And they take it
like that.
So they say,
we want a unique assortment,
because you're saying is,
Everybody else is selling
the black, the white,
the basic stuff, right...
right
and you're able to come in
and say, look,
I'm gonna have a really cool
gift that someone can give...
right.
'cause it's got Heath, coconut,
all these funky flavors.
Right.
Raven, can I see that tin?
My kids will eat anything
that you put chocolate on.
Work with me on this
for a second,
because this is
my moment with you.
I have $400,000.
I've just put it on this table.
Let's pretend it's there.
Okay.
I get this tin--
can I borrow that for a second?
I put it beside the $400,000,
and I go online and I say,
who can make me pretzels
with stuff and chocolate
and flavoring on them
that look like this?
How many people,
you think, Can do that?
I think, a lot.
Maybe, but they can't
do it like me.
Sure they can.
They can't--
(mark) no, they can't.
You know why?
Because you've put your heart,
your soul, and your love
into it, and you care
about the business.
That's just wonderful.
It's called sweat equity,
Kevin...
that's just wonderful.
And you might not like to do
work, but some people do, right?
That's just wonderful.
Cry me a river, mark.
Sweat--Sweat equity
has value.
Let's talk about
reality here, Buddy.
The reality--
there's absolutely nothing
proprietary about this at all.
And you know
what happens next, Kevin?
And it's not worth $400,000.
You know what happens next?
You hire them, and you know
what they do right after that?
They quit 'cause
you're a son of a bitch
and they won't want
to work for you.
Oh, that's crap.
She's not going anywhere.
This is her baby.
So look,
at the end of the day,
we got to deal
with reality.
If you can't tell me why I can't
hire somebody just like you
to make this
with a $400,000 pile of cash--
I bet you only have to spend
$20,000 to get this done.
Kevin, it's not
a computer business.
It doesn't matter!
There's no proprietary
software here.
If you had to say to us
right now
why we should invest in this,
give us your very best.
Why should we invest in you?
The main reason is because
I have two little kids
and I'm showing them that
you just follow your dreams,
you can do whatever you decide
to do with your life.
I'm doing it, I'm successful,
and I'm-a keep going.
It makes me happy
and it's fun.
It's, you know, it's something
that I really love to do.
That's not enough for me.
Yeah, you know what, Raven?
That's a good story,
but it's not a good reason.
Okay.
(Robert) This is
the real world of business.
Right.
When someone like that
asks you that question,
you got to give her
a benefit as investor,
so let's do that again.
Okay. Let's do it again.
Don't tell me
about your family--
well, before--before
you do that again, I'm out.
Good.
Give us one reason
that we should invest in it.
One reason is that...
and maybe you would change
your mind when I say this--
ain't gonna happen.
Okay.
Well, I had to walk away
from a $2 million deal
because I did not have
the capital to fill the Order.
Hello.
That's a good reason.
That's a good reason,
I would think.
That was better. Good job!
Shut the front door.
(laughs)
Good for you.
Wh--who was it from?
Sam's club.
You got an ORDER
from Sam's club...
yes.
And you had to
walk away from it?
For $2 million?
I had to walk away
from that because--
how long ago was that?
I just spoke to them last week,
and the door's wide open.
I could fill the same order
within the next 12 months.
Okay, Raven, I'm gonna
sell you now, right?
Do you have an interest
in being my partner?
I do. I'm here. You rock.
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make it
very, very simple for you.
(Raven) Thank you.
There's no negotiation.
He just gave her exactly
what she was looking for.
I got one problem with these.
I will eat 'em all,
so you're not allowed
to send me any.
Eat them all.
Thank you.
Thanks, Raven.
We'll be in touch very shortly.
(Lori and mark) Good Luck.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
I'm so excited
that the painted Pretzel's
