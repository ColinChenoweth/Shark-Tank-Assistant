My name is Ryan Naylor,
and I'm the founder
of esso watches.
Esso watches
is a silicon watch company
focused on fashionable designs
infused with
Negative ion technology.
We're seeking
an investment of $35,000
in exchange
for 20% of the company.
Every day, our bodies
are bombarded by positive ions,
which are molecules
that are simply emitted
from Electronic devices--
computers, tvs,
fluorescent lighting.
Too much positive ion
on our bodies
puts unnatural pressure on us.
What we have done is, we use
the counterpart of positive ion
to help bring our body back
to its more natural state,
Called negative ion.
What we do is,
we put it in our watches,
and it helps restore
our energy field in our bodies.
Just want to make sure what
you're telling me here, Ryan.
You're basically saying
this positive-negative Ion thing
is a real health concern.
'cause it sounds a little,
you know...
fluffy?
Well, it sounds a lot
like a coffee enema.
Supposedly good for you,
but who knows, right?
Right.
You might be a little skeptical
if it indeed works,
so I'd like to do
a quick balance test
to see if you can
feel the difference.
So anybody want to try?
All right.
(mark) go for it, Lori.
(Ryan) This is gonna
test your balance,
so what I want you to do is,
put both arms out like a "T,"
and then just resist my pressure
So let me put a little pressure.
So now just stand on your
left foot. Are you balanced?
(laughs) No.
(mark) That's good!
(Robert)
she can't even do that!
This is a good challenge because
I can't even stand. Right.
Now just put on--put on a watch.
Got a pink one just for you.
Now if it works,
then we know it works.
Okay.
A pink one.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Just resist.
Resist.
Looks like it's working,
doesn't it?
Yeah, you look like you have
more balance in that one.
That's a little weird.
Yeah. Do you feel it?
Little difference?
Well, yeah.
So I actually have a few watches
for each of you guys to have.
Thank you very much.
Here you go.
Here's yours.
No, Thanks. Go ahead.
You keep it.
Well, Ryan, Everybody's
calling you a scam artist,
one guy called you a liar,
and you're just kind of
sucking it all in.
He's wearing his watches.
Yeah. I-I've got my balance.
I'm not... emotional.
(sharks laugh)
I got to tell you,
you can take a lot of abuse
and still hang in there.
I like that about you.
Look, Ryan, I don't believe
in any of this. I'm out.
Thank you.
There's been a lot
of interesting discussion
about scam here today.
Now how about this?
If you admit it's a scam,
maybe I'll invest.
Is it a scam?
I d--I don't believe it is.
Okay, so my options are,
I invest and have the crap
beaten out of me by mark cuban.
I don't like that too much.
You're telling me it's real,
but can't get it on tv
because it's not accredited
by anybody
in the medical profession.
I don't see an OPTION here
except to say I'm out.
Okay. Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
(Lori) Good luck.
Bad Luck.
Mojo.
(Robert) You know what?
I don't care what you think,
but you got to believe
in your business.
Why didn't the guy
defend himself?
That was the turning point
for me.
We beat him up pretty Badly.
Yeah, and he's not
a fighter, either.
What is he, a lover, Lori?
(laughs)
He's a lover, not a fighter.
It frustrates me that--
that mark cuban clouded
the water for the other sharks.
It's too bad that
they weren't able to--
to focus on me and my product
rather than Being
scared off by mark Cuban.
