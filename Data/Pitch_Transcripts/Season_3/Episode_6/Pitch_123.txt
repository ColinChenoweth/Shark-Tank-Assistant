My name is Jared Joyce.
I'm an inventor/entrepreneur,
and today,
in exchange for $250,000,
I'm offering you 25% equity
in my patented
five-minute furniture.
In my hand are
assembly instructions
for one of my competitor's
furniture designs.
They are printed on several
pages, in multiple languages,
and they come with
a frustrating bag of hardware.
My furniture Designs
require none of this.
Let me show you.
This is a cube design,
and the first thing to notice
is this patented joint,
which allows us to comfortably
slide two side walls together,
to create
a flush right corner.
Notice that all side walls are
identical,
so there's no confusion
as to what part to grab
or in What order to assemble.
You simply grab and go.
Once the side walls are
connected,
we have created a perimeter
for our Backer piece
to rest on.
And finally, this is
the rotational lockdown.
This is the piece that makes
this ease of assembly
like nothing
you have ever known.
Simply drop it in,
quarter turn...
(Click)
and Boom. Can't come apart.
Wow.
Thank you.
We currently have over 30
designs using this joint system.
And this joint system can be
applied to any 4-sided object--
tables, chairs, dressers,
desks, bookshelves.
For those of you who have
ever purchased
the traditional bookshelf,
it will take you
at least an hour
to put that bookshelf together.
These bookshelves assemble,
with no tools required,
in under five minutes.
So I invite you
to come up and play,
experience
this ease of assembly.
Or if you prefer, we can jump
into the always exciting q &amp; a.
Q &amp; A sounds good to me.
Let's do it, Kevin.
Why don't you tell me
about sales?
No sales to date.
Our second patent issued
four months ago.
We currently have two companies
interested in Licensing.
So, Jared, you put a $1 million
value on your company
by asking me to give you
$250,000 for 25%.
Correct.
Is your strategy
from day one
not to bother
trying to get distribution,
but to simply license it?
Let me give you
my thoughts on that.
I am no stranger when it comes
to getting paid to go away.
(mark and Robert laugh)
trust me, neither is Kevin,
but usually by his dates.
Licensing is
how I made my money.
You made your money?
Have you made money before?
I run a research
and development Firm.
Uh, we currently have over
80 products in the portfolio,
and this is one of them.
But the reason I don't think we
should license this technology
is that regardless
of the next dot-com BOOM
or next best-selling app,
the world will need
furniture solutions.
So, Jared,
what have you invented
in that portfolio of 80
or 90 patents, however many,
that's made any money?
Uh, only one so far is
making money.
What is that product?
I'm just curious.
That product is called
the plug hub.
How much money has it made?
Uh, it's been on the market
for a month.
I think they sold
10,000 units.
Now how much money do you have
invested in this?
Uh, in this--
w-with All my designs,
I try not to put in
more than $1,000 myself.
$1,000?
S-so with that,
there's $250,000
of investor funds in this.
So the $250,000 you spent is
purely on getting to today?
Correct.
Are you offering us equity
in your company
or in this one product?
Today I'm pitching
the five-minute Furniture.
As you can imagine, if we do
this deal and we like it,
we like each other,
of course I'd be open
to discussing more deals
in the future.
Why aren't we getting offered
anything
in the company in general?
The problem with That statement
is that you're saying,
"Hey, let's get married,"
and I'm saying... (chuckles)
"Hey. Buy me a drink first."
This is a real slick Willie
over here.
(laughs)
I got it.
You're saying that you're
putting me on an interview
when I may give you
a quarter-million dollars
for a bunch of plastic stuff,
and you may employ
a bunch of people
to go and push all your other
brands, make the contacts.
No, that's not
what you're saying.
You're saying We get
a piece of all the products.
No.
That's not what
he's saying at all, Robert.
If you're lucky enough
to invest in his <i>one </i>product,
you may impress him enough
to give him more money
for the rest of the crap
he has.
Exactly.
I'm out.
Jared, I-I just have to ask
because I'm curious.
$250,000 you've raised
for this patent.
How much money have you raised
across the other 79 products
that you've designed?
Uh, a total
of about $1 million.
How long ago
did you start raising money
for your first design?
Seven years ago.
How many of those investors
have you returned
all of their funds for?
So far, none.
You're serving
too many masters.
If I gave you $250,000,
you have to eat, sleep,
and breathe this one deal.
I don't see you doing that.
I think you're an inventor
extraordinaire in your own mind.
So I'm out.
Jared, let me tell you what--
what I'm struggling with here.
When I take a dollar
from an investor,
I feel a <i>huge, </i>a huge amount
of responsibility for that.
I want to pay them back.
I will pay them back
before I eat.
So I just don't have
the confidence
in you to deliver.
I like the product.
I just don't trust you.
I'm out.
I understand the importance
of what you've done.
I think it's brilliant.
I really like this.
I like that you have patents.
But I don't want
all of your other stuff,
the baggage
that goes around with this.
So I'm willing
to make an offer to you
if another shark
will go in with me.
I'll put up $125,000,
but I want 100% of this.
We'll buy the patents.
We'll take over doing
the furniture ourselves.
And you go back and you do
what you were doing
with everything else
and everybody else.
But you gotta get Kevin.
I'm there.
It's a slick move, Lori.
So you're gonna buy
the whole thing,
fire him before
he even leaves out of here.
(Lori) Yep.
I like that.
(Kevin) Jared, let me tell you
why you should do this deal.
Your history so far
has been a Roach Motel.
Dollars go in.
They never come out.
After seven years,
no return of capital investors.
That's bad.
Here's an opportunity,
with Lori and I,
to have your first huge win.
You have nothing now for this.
2 minutes from now,
you have $250,000 cash.
$250,000
for 100% of the patent,
and you stay at home.
What are you gonna do?
Jared, you're not listening.
We're not interested
in partnering with you.
We want to give you
a quarter of a million dollars,
end of story.
Do you want to take it or not?
I want to hear your answer
in 15 seconds or I'll be out.
What are you gonna do, Jared?
It's now or never.
I would not be doing right
by my investors
to say that I took 7 years,
$250,000, we're breaking even,
no opportunity.
Good luck, Jared.
See you on twitter.
Good for him
for sticking to his guns.
He's a slimeball.
That guy had so many patents,
so many products.
I think he made a huge mistake.
Huge Mistake.
He did make a huge mistake.
I thought he blew
an opportunity.
we've got pot roast,
we've got golf course,
barbecue, football,
draft beer, popcorn, or--
say there's somebody
in your house
you really don't want
to hang around too long--
We've got the fart candle.
(laughs)
I really call it
a vitamin c deficiency,
'cause you don't have cash,
credit, or enough customers.
I'm out.
Even though I didn't get a deal
from one of the sharks,
they gave me advice and told me
exactly what I needed to do
to make my business flourish.
I secured the capital I needed
to be able
to grow my business properly,
and my business
is now exploding.
I took my sales
from over $70,000 a year
to over $250,000 a year.
I'm in over 500 retail stores
all across the country.
I'm also in some big chains
like Spencer's gifts,
Kirkland's, and Hallmark.
I really do feel
Like a c.E.O. Now.
I come every day to my Office.
I have full-time employees.
I have a national sales Force.
Can you bring over
some more lids, please?
I used to hand-pour
all of my candles at home.
Now I have full-time employees
in my manufacturing facility
helping me keep up
with the demand
of all of the orders
We're getting.
In this economy,
it feels great to be able to
hire and employ people, and also
be able to give back some.
It's exciting.
I have truly become a C.E.O.
