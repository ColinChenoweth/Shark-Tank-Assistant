I'm Dallas Robinson...
and I'm Mike buonomo...
(both) and we're
from salt lake city, utah.
We first met in college,
and we just kinda clicked.
Some Ideas just percolate up.
We've created something that
creates a chemistry
between two people
that's absolutely Amazing.
Yeah?
Yeah, I think that's right.
We grew up with
a very strong moral background,
and we always walk, uh...
(chuckles)
a little bit of a fine line
with our product,
but we feel like we've found
a way to come together
with Our moral backgrounds
and still promote
this awesome product.
So Everybody's been
super supportive
about our venture,
uh, especially our wives.
They've gotten jobs
to help support our--
what do you--
our endeavor.
Yeah, our endeavors.
(chuckles)
It would be huge
to get an investment
with one of the sharks.
We've gone as far
as we can by ourselves.
We have to have somebody to help
us get through the next level.
Hello, sharks.
I'm Dallas Robinson...
and I'm Mike buonomo,
and our company is kisstixx.
We're seeking
a $200,000 investment
for 20% of our company.
Now just a few years ago
when I was a high school senior,
I focused on two things--
having fun in the sun
and trying to get
the cute girls to kiss me.
Now I quickly found out
that these activities
don't always mix Well.
While playing in the sun,
my lips would get dry
and chapped,
and at that point,
no one wanted to kiss me,
so I tried every lip balm
out on the market,
and the only thing worse
than kissing dry, chapped lips
are chapped lips that taste
like Cherry cough syrup.
It's disgusting, so I knew
there had to be a better way
to soften up my lips and ramp up
my game with the ladies,
and that's why
I created kisstixx.
Kisstixx is
a high-quality Lip balm
that comes packaged
in two compatible flavors--
one for you
<i>and†</i>one for your partner.
When you kiss,
these amazing flavors combine,
creating
a chemistry reaction
That's bursting
with Flavors and aroma.
Now we have several delicious
combinations here for you,
including strawberry daiquiri
and pi—a colada,
so when you kiss, you get
miami vice, just like the drink.
(chuckles)
We have peaches and cream,
raspberry and lemonade,
and our best seller,
fire and ice,
where one heats up
while the other cools down,
creating
a fun tingling sensation
that you will never forget.
Now fortunately for you guys,
we brought with us
our fully functional
kissing Booth,
so a f--a kissing Booth always
features a beautiful lady,
So, Barbara, we were wondering
if you could come down
and help us on this one?
No. Hold it right there.
Who's gonna kiss me?
Kevin!
(men laugh)
Come on down!
Come on--come on down
and help us out. (chuckles)
I love it.
Like Mike said,
this is our best seller,
fire and ice, okay?
Wait. Wait.
Did you invite him?
Absolutely.
Absolutely. Get down here.
Yeah, absolutely. (laughs)
I've been waiting, Barbara.
Barbara, you're already
hot enough...
All right.
So for you, we got some ice
to cool you down...
(chuckling)
Yeah.
So there's some ice for ya.
You can go ahead
and just put it on.
All right.
This is the fire.
Since you're--
fire.
(men laughing)
We figured, since you're,
you know, a little hotheaded,
we got the fire for ya,
right?
Absolutely.
Barbara, are you really
gonna kiss Kevin?
No, I hope not. (laughs)
Here you go.
There's the fire for ya.
We'll find out real soon.
All right.
(chuckles)
Wow. Tingly.
Feels Good.
Mm. Ooh.
Listen, Barbara,
if I turn to stone,
I'm gonna be pretty unhappy.
(all laughing)
(men, chanting)
Kiss, kiss, kiss...
and then kiss
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...
to mix the flavors.
Barbara, let's go.
(laughs)
Come on, sweetie.
Oh, no.
Just a little Peck.
(chants)
Go, go, go, go, go.
You have to do it
just to make sure it works.
I'm backing you up here.
Come on. Let's try it out.
(Robert) Smooch, baby!
(laughs) Don't grab her.
Don't... (laughs)
I'm ready, Baby.
Kevin, no fondling.
You have to commit to it.
Don't get your dentures
locked up, guys.
(laughs)
I feel the fire.
(Barbara and Robert laugh)
I feel the fire.
(mark) Oh, lord.
I'm gonna get ill.
Oh!
(laughs)
I didn't get there.
(laughs)
No, you have to hold it
for just a second...
all right.
Yeah? You gotta--
so you can get
the full effect.
(laughs)
Ohh!
Let's hold it, sweetie.
Ready?
(laughing)
hold it. You gotta hold it.
A little longer.
Ohh!
(laughing)
Yes! (laughing) Yes.
Oh, my God. Yes.
(laughs)
Tasty. Very tasty.
Ohh.
Ohh.
(high-pitched Voice)
That's so disgusting.
Why did I have
to see that?
(laughs)
That's so disgusting.
Did you feel anything?
It worked.
(Barbara) Oh, god.
You definitely get
a, uh, change in flavor.
So the question is,
who's feeling the chemistry
and ready to invest in us?
W--so do you have
any sales of this stuff?
Wait, wait, wait.
Just for the record,
I want to say... (chuckles)
You know how
when you kiss someone,
it can change your feeling?
This didn't change a thing.
(men chuckling)
it confirmed--
it confirmed it all.
But you'll always
remember it, so...
Oh, god.
(chuckles) Yeah, so will
the whole world.
(chuckles)
(Robert) Yeah.
How does it work?
We had in our minds,
we wanted it to Tingle,
we wanted it to change flavors,
so a team of chemists came up
with our formulas.
They're better
than anything out there.
They actually work, and they do
the Tingle sensation.
What about revenue?
What about sales?
We've been doing this
just barely a year last month...
(daymond) Here we go.
And we actually--
(Robert and mark chuckle)
We hit a milestone for us,
which is $80,000 in Sales.
Total for the year, right?
Um...
what do you think a business
that does $80,000 in sales
is worth?
Sales and a half.
Okay, so that would get you
kinda into the $100,000,
$120,000 range...
sure.
And you're telling me
your business is worth
a million dollars,
because you want me
to give you $200,000 for 20%.
Right.
What's the problem?
This.
It's our new Vendor paperwork
That's setting us up with one of
the largest drugstore chains
in the United States, walgreens,
so...
Dallas, can I see it?
Have they placed an order?
Is it a test or--
can I see it?
Is it a test
or is it in every store?
What they want to do is
roll us out in 7,500 stores
for
Valentine's day promotion.
$540,000 is what they're gonna
order in product,
see how it goes.
What's it cost you
to make one of these?
Yeah.
Depending on volume,
between 86 cents and $1.
And that's for one of them
or for--
that's for the package
that you see right there.
Everything all together.
The whole package of two?
Mm-hmm.
And what are you gonna sell them
to--to your big retailer?
We're wholesaling 'em
right now for $3 a unit,
and then they're retailing 'em
at about $5.99.
So how much will you make
on that order?
We'll make $337,000.
Dallas, how did you get
walgreens?
Well, I went out
and tried to find people
who knew people
at walgreens.
We went to them, and they
brokered us in to walgreens.
Mike, tell me
about the other $80,000,
not the walgreens.
Who bought that $80,000?
We sell on our web site,
but we're in over 100
retail locations right now.
Um, we actually just got
approved for--
in 485 associated food stores
that we started distributing to
two weeks ago.
Where do you see it going?
We've got several ideas
for other mix-and-match
Kissing products
that we want to bring out
after the fact.
Like what?
The next thing that we have
is called kiss mists,
and it's, like, a breath spray,
so it's the same kind of idea.
Oh, that's cool.
We want to roll out gum
as well,
so you can do
the kisstixx Gum.
That's actually very cool.
(Barbara chuckles)
Uh, it could just be
the aftereffect of kissing
Kevin O'Leary...
(laughs)
(Kevin and Dallas chuckle)
My gut is saying
big-time No. I'm out.
It's a bad memory.
(mark and daymond laugh)
You're telling me
it's worth a million bucks,
and I can't get there.
That's what's really
holding me back.
I'm certainly impressed
with what you've done.
Now I didn't turn to stone
when I kissed Barbara, but...
(mark chuckles)
What's interesting is
that the two people that kissed
aren't doing the deal,
so I don't know
what that says...
but I'm out.
(Dallas) Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Kevin, was there a Tingle
after you kissed Barbara?
Yeah, you get
a little burst of flavor.
Did you get
a little excited?
Well, it was more than that.
(laughs)
Oh, no. (laughs)
I had a--I had
a burning sensation.
(sharks laugh)
I can't believe
we got a deal with mark, um,
but even more Unbelievable
is that we got
Barbara and Kevin to kiss,
so... (chuckles)
it might not work out
between them,
but it sure worked out
for us, so...
(chuckles) Worked for us.
Sweet.
