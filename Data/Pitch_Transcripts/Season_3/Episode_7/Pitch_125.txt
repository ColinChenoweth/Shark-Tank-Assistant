Hello, sharks.
My name is Stephanie...
and I'm
her husband Daniel...
and our business is
the smart Baker.
We are seeking $75,000
for a 25% stake in our company.
Home baking has never been
more popular than it is today.
More and more people are
getting back into the kitchen
and making things from scratch
to help them save money.
Our goal at the smart Baker
is to make
those bakers' lives easier.
Since most recipes call
for an amount much too high
for just two people,
I'm always left on my own
to scale recipes down
and convert odd measurements.
I'd always wind up
with a baking disaster
that no one wanted to eat.
(mouths word)
(mark and Kevin laugh)
my husband and I created a way
to solve this problem
and have all this information
at a Baker's fingertips
when they need it.
And where better to put this
than on their apron?
What's unique is that
it's printed upside down,
so you can read it
while you're wearing it.
Within two weeks of creating
the cheat sheet apron
and putting it online,
we quickly went from selling
a few a week to over 50 a day
right out of our garage.
We've also designed a line
of Parchment paper that
comes in precut, flat sheets
that are made to fit
the most common Size
baking Pans.
Plus, we've added
unique lift tabs that
put us ahead
of our competitors.
Oh, good idea.
Our newest hot item is our line
of cupcake and treat Towers.
Unlike other disposable towers
made of cardboard,
the smart Baker's cupcake
and treat tower is reusable
and made of
washable, durable P.V.C.,
eliminating the need
to constantly replace
after every use.
With your help, we can make
everyone a smart Baker,
and we'd like you
to be one, too.
Thank you, Stephanie.
Here you go.
Look at that.
Thank you.
Okay, so this is very cute.
Let's talk about what matters--
money.
Do you have any sales?
We do. Uh, overall we've had
about $72,000 in sales.
In the past three months alone,
we've had over $34,000.
What do you think you'll do
for the rest of this year?
We're hoping to end the year
out at about $140,000.
We hope to net about
$100,000.
Great Margin. That's how
you start a small business.
So are you living off this,
or this is a Hobby?
Right now, for me,
this is a full-time job.
Last year, I was
an ELEMENTARY art teacher,
but I actually just found out
yesterday that I lost my job...
Oh.
Wow.
That sucks.
So smart Baker will now be
full-time for me,
and I'm gonna need
to make it work.
One door closes,
another one opens, right?
Are you selling
everything on a web site,
going to trade shows?
How are you actually
selling the product?
Currently We're selling
them online,
through mail-order catalog
with the aprons.
We've done, uh,
some trade shows.
What's your best seller?
Currently our best seller
is the cupcake tower.
We've done about $40,000
in Sales since October.
What does it sell for?
Retail, $59.99 to $64.95.
I think what puts
our cupcake towers Apart
is that it could be
for a big, grand event
like a wedding,
but using our modular design,
you could take off
a tier or two,
and you have
a smaller structure,
good for smaller parties.
(Robert) Stephanie,
do you mind me asking
how long
you've been married?
Eight months,
but together ten years.
So you went out
for ten years
and have only been married
for eight months?
That's his fault.
(all laugh)
Did--did you ever date
anybody else?
Nope.
High school sweethearts.
No. Yeah.
Wow. No kidding?
The reason I asked is you have
such a great relationship,
the way you finish
each other's sentences...
(chuckles)
Without arguing.
What is it with the syrup
all the time?
Robert gets so sappy
on everything. My Goodness.
Let's say you had the time
and the help to focus
just on getting more sales.
What would you do?
The first thing I would do
is the trade shows.
When people see the product,
they fall in love with it.
Yeah.
You know what, guys?
I-I like what you're doing,
but I think
I'm such an internet geek
I'd probably have a hard time
on the retail side.
You have a strategy there,
and I might be the guy
to hold you back,
so for that reason,
I'm gonna say I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.
Now I buy
your premise that,
the economy being soft,
casual dining dollars are down.
I'm just wondering, though,
how do you scale this business?
You're sort of on the cusp of
being a Hobby versus a business.
Your valuation is not crazy.
You're asking for a value
of $300,000
on something
that might make $100,000.
Trouble is, you gotta eat,
literally...
correct.
So you gotta pay yourself
most of the profits,
so for me, as an investment,
it's--it's very marginal.
Not enough meat on the bone
to invest in it.
I'm out.
I know I can be
like Kevin sometimes,
where I think I know
everything about everything...
(chuckles)
But you don't.
You're not like me.
But in this case...
(chuckles) I actually don't know
that much about the baking
and--and cooking business.
I will definitely be a customer.
I just can't add value to you.
Okay.
I'm out.
Are you making an offer?
I'm not sure.
So, Stephanie and Daniel,
I want to offer you
the $75,000
for 40% of your company.
Is that the only offer?
It's the only offer
I heard.
The only offer you heard.
It's a hard one for me.
I could argue either side of it.
Do you have any debt?
(Stephanie and Daniel)
No. No debt.
You know, I bought
a business in the tank here
named Daisy Cakes.
She had, for the year,
$3,000 in sales.
Do you know she's been selling
$100,000 worth of cakes a month?
Wow.
That's awesome.
But I made a deal with her
that I was wondering,
perhaps you might consider,
because it gave me
an opportunity
to get the money back out,
if you might pay me a f--
well, he'll call it a royalty.
I'm calling it a return,
a 5% return on what you sell,
and if you'd be willing
to do that,
I was going to make
the exact same offer
the guy who knows nothing
about baking just made,
$75,000 for 40%, but let me
tell you what I do know.
I know distributorship.
I know the baking business.
I know the technology piece
of the food business,
and I know
the marketing business.
And she knows how
to kiss Butt and lie.
(laughs) Oh.
You understand the difference
between the shark
and the Sharkette's offer?
This one comes
with a 5% royalty on top of it.
This one comes with everything
needed to make your business
a huge business quickly,
and let me tell you something,
I could take your sales,
and I could quintuple them
in a month, simply because I've
set up the network to do it,
which was not easy to set up
and very expensive.
This guy doesn't know a darn
thing about the baking business.
You know what?
The only problem about this
is that I don't remember
seeing Barbara
around the thanksgiving table.
She's not family.
She doesn't know what I know,
so she can basically tell
her great resume and say
how much I don't know.
She doesn't have a clue.
So you're in
the baking business?
I might be.
I did fail to tell you
one thing.
The royalty on--
is totally ended
the minute I recoup
the investment.
Tell them anything else
you want to tell them...
I've told them everything.
'cause you--
you seem a little desperate
at this point.
Stephanie...
I'm not
the least bit desperate.
(speaks indistinctly)
You haven't shut up
since you o--made
your offer.
This is why I love the tank.
You have two offers.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna counter
Barbara's offer,
see if she is willing to do
$100,000 for the 40%
with the 5% royalty.
I'd have to say no on that.
(mouth full) Wow.
Does your previous offer
still stand?
It's $75,000 for 40%
with the 5% of sales
off the top
until it's repaid,
definitely.
You got a deal.
I think we will take it.
(Barbara) whoo!
There you go.
Yes.
Whoa.
That was so exciting!
(Stephanie and Daniel
laughing)
(laughs)
Mwah!
How about me?
Oh.
He can dip you, too.
No, no. I don't want a kiss.
I just felt left out.
He can dip you. (laughs)
Yes. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Great. The smart Bakers.
Thank you so much.
(Kevin) Ohh.
I'm so excited.
Yeah. (chuckles)
(high-pitched voice) Oh!
(normal voice)
Got what we came for, baby.
What were you doing putting
your nose in that business?
I was gonna license it,
that's all.
License it.
I don't like to lose,
but I'm happy for them.
