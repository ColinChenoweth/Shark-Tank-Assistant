Hi.
My name is Scott Jordan.
I'm the founder
and C.E.O. Of tec,
and I'm seeking
a $500,000 investment
in exchange
for 15% of my company.
You see, I'm a gadget guy.
I gotta have my stuff
with me wherever I'm going.
At any given moment,
I've got my cell phone,
my digital camera,
my tablet, my laptop,
and all the gadgets and gizmos
and headsets and batteries
that go along with it.
The list is never-ending.
Technology certainly has
made my life easier,
but it can be a lot
of stuff to carry around,
especially when you travel
as often as I do.
So what if I told you I had
everything on this desk
in the Vest
I'm wearing right now?
Introducing Tec--
technology enabled Clothing.
Tec is a patented system
that lets you carry
everything you need,
know where it is,
and access it easily in
Specially designed pockets.
We've engineered our pockets
to fit almost any device,
and these pockets are
layered into clothing
so that there are no bulges
and everything is Balanced.
Many of these hidden pockets
have unique features, like--
check this out--
cleartouch fabric that
allows you to see
and control your device
right through the FABRIC
without ever taking it out.
We've even developed
a patented system
to wire your headphones
right through the lining,
so you no longer have to contend
with this tangled web of wires
every time you have a call
or Want to listen to your music.
I intend to license tec
to every major clothing company,
because I know
that this can become
the next huge ingredient brand,
like gor-tex, velcro,
polartec,
and so many others.
Right now tec is poised
to revolutionize
the clothing industry,
and this is
a billion-dollar opportunity.
All right. I've told you
about my pockets.
Now it's time for you
to reach deep into yours.
Scott, two days ago,
I'm flipping through the back
of "Men's journal" Magazine,
and there was a similar product,
and I thought,
wow, what a great idea.
Yeah.
Is that you?
(chuckles) That is--
it is a great idea,
and--and it is my product.
I formed a retail company
to prove the concept of
technology enabled clothing,
and I've been running
that company
for a-a number of years,
waiting for the patent,
and now that it is issued,
I'm here seeking an investment
in Technology enabled clothing
as a licensing company
to bring this system--
the intellectual property
along with
the registered brand name
and the product know-how--
to other clothing companies.
Tell me about
the retail business,
'cause that proves the concept.
Yes, it does. It's like--
what are the sales
in the retail business?
Well, to date,
it's $5.1 million,
and we're on track to do
$12 million this year.
The retail business--
is that real--
That's not part of this.
(mouths word)
That's not part of it?
No.
Is the idea now
that we're not gonna sell
this retail,
we're simply gonna step back,
take the intellectual property,
the I.P.,
and license it to others?
That--that's exactly right.
I-in terms of the offer
I'm presenting here today,
it's for
the intellectual property
and the brand name,
the bigger idea,
the billion-dollar idea.
Right.
Scott, you're saying
that the proprietary patent,
which you say you have now...
yes, I do.
Is what you're selling me,
right?
Right.
Why aren't you bundling it
all together?
Why are you being
so greedy and Savage?
'cause I'm like you.
(chuckles) Oh.
(laughs)
What I'd like you
to understand is that
what my other company
has been doing
has been building the brand
of technology enabled clothing
for years.
What is the technology
we are buying?
I see that you can put
the speakers through the Hood.
Now I know Burton--
uh, n-not through the Hood,
but through
the pocketing system, Yeah.
Headphones--
uh, I know Burton has done
this for years,
so what exactly do you have
that's different
from all the other ones
that I know exist?
Well, th-they infringed
on our patent.
Have you ever protected it?
Yes.
And you collected?
Did you win?
Yes.
I've settled with 11
of the largest companies,
including V.F. Corporation,
north face...
Sure.
Ralph Lauren,
Calvin Klein...
okay.
Under Armour, spyder.
Are you getting
an ongoing royalty?
Uh, it's subject
to non--uh,
confidentiality agreements...
but wait a second, though.
And so--
is it getting a royalty stream
from the settlements?
You don't have
to tell me how much.
Uh, yes.
Okay, listen.
And is that part
of your bottom line?
Stop right now.
Stop right now.
You need me very badly.
Yes.
I know how to Sue people.
(mark, Barbara, and Scott laugh)
This is going to be wonderful.
I want it all, though.
Why are you just giving me
a taste,
when I want to eat
the whole pie?
But, Kevin, Kevin, hey.
Let's not get--let's--
I don't need you
for the other company.
Kevin. Kevin.
Kevin.
Yes, you do.
Oh. (chuckles)
I just don't.
The problem is,
there's leakage in the deal.
I don't get
any of the good stuff,
just the risky stuff.
No, it--
no, it's not risky.
So, Scott, what exactly is
the property that you own that
you can defend
and have defended?
A garment
with no wires in it
but the capacity
to wire things in it.
Is it a design patent?
Yeah,
design and utility patent.
And it's been issued?
Not only issued,
not only tested in litigation,
but recently reexamined
and passed reexamination.
So basically, the patent
is attributable to the wires?
That's right.
Only the wires?
So they--for example,
this pocket here
has a hole in it
that leads up through here.
That's ridiculous.
That is ridiculous.
That's just common sense.
Wires in, wires out.
That's what's killing
this country,
that we get dumbass patents
that people
then turn around and Sue,
when it's just
common sense stuff.
Yes, I love this country.
It's ridiculous.
But, uh--
you're being un-American.
Think--think about--
think about this.
I understand
as a businessman
exactly what you're saying,
especially as an EX-lawyer
who hated dealing
with Lawyers so much
I stopped practicing law.
Running a wire
through a piece of clothing?
I'm telling you, mark.
I mean, I-I--
that's a patent?
Are you kidding me?!
who cares? Retail value.
No, you're crazy. No, no, no,
no. You're so full of crap.
(daymond) Scott, the cases
you have defended have been
when--argument's sake,
let's say one of my designers--
and I have 30 of 'em--
decide to wire something, a Hood
or something else like that.
It goes out.
We don't even know you exist
and have that patent.
You hit us. We say, "instead
of paying the attorney bills,
"Give him $50,000 to go away
'cause we don't have time
for this," and that's it.
And that's the reason why you've
got to defend all of those--
and that is <i>horrible, </i>
horrible, horrible, horrible.
I love it!
Why do you say that?
That is what this country
was formed on...
you're a lawyer.
You're gonna say that.
Coming up with a unique idea
and defending it.
Scott, just to be really clear,
you came up
with a fantastic idea.
You patented that idea.
You went out and built
a business on your idea
that'll do
$12 million this year,
$24 million next year...
if not more.
And now you don't want
to sell us any of that business.
You just wanna take the idea
and sell us the patent of it.
Yes, I do.
My other business only has
a very insignificant part
of a much larger market.
No, because
your other business
could end up being
the billion-dollar business
that we have nothing in.
Did you start it
just to cap off at $12 million?
You're gonna grow
that business.
Um...
and you're gonna have
the first right
to this technology
and not have to pay us.
That's all negotiable. Okay?
I mean...
so...
I'm here to negotiate.
Would you sell me 15%
of <i>that </i>business
for $500,000?
You've gotta be kidding me.
(laughs)
Wait. Wait.
Scott, Scott, just to be clear,
I'm out.
I understand.
Scott, okay, so we're talking
about $1.2 million free cash?
Yeah.
What's a clothing company
trading at these days?
Let's call it five times?
No.
Why?
Inter--internet Clo--'cause
we're direct to consumer.
We're internet
clothing company.
What's it worth?
$30 Million.
$30 million?
$30 Million on--
who's insane now?
'cause it's growing
at 100% a year.
It has intellectual property.
That's where it's unique.
It's online.
It's building a brand.
A lifestyle brand.
It--it's not--first of all,
the intellectual property
is built about running a wire
the clothing.
A rivet, a wire, velcro.
It doesn't matter
what it is.
It <i>does </i>matter because
wireless is what's next.
Wires will not go away
with battery power,
and--and for the time being,
for music.
People will always prefer
to listen to music
with wire Headsets.
Sound Quality's better.
You don't have to worry
about pairing issues.
I-I don't agree.
I'll put low power bluetooth
into the shoulder.
Let it distribute
to all the other devices
and to the headphones.
I'd kick your ass.
So I'm out.
You were out
from the moment you sat down,
so I--you know,
you're no loss.
What is your problem?
Why would you say a comment
like that to mark?
You called me insane.
No, I--your valuations
were insane.
I think it's an insult
that you wouldn't offer us
part of the bigger picture.
I'm out.
(Kevin) You know,
they asked a scorpion
why it would kill something
that's floating across the pond.
'cause it's its nature.
You're a lawyer. It's
your nature to be like this.
I'm okay with it.
Mark brings up a great point
about wireless.
You gotta admit that.
It hasn't happened today.
It's coming,
and technology changes,
and there will be very low-cost
wireless headphones.
It'll erode your share.
In the meantime,
you're doing a great job
building this business.
Now Robert made you an offer.
He said, bundle them together
and he'll give you 500k for 15%.
I'll go in with him
on that deal and go 50/50,
If he wants to come in with me,
we'll double it
for 30%.
I gave you $500,000 for 15%.
I don't need O'Leary on that.
Would you consider that?
Fine, then I'll make the--
I'll make the same offer.
You can choose between us.
I'll make you the same offer
'cause I think
combining them together
in the clothing industry,
with the risk of wireless
taking some share away
in the next 36 months--
500k for 15%.
Scott, is--is there a premise
under which
you're gonna entertain and offer
in the real business?
Well, I-I have a call
that I need to make.
You know who was
on my advisory board?
Steve Wozniak,
the cofounder of apple.
I-I need to talk
with Steve Wozniak.
Tell woz I said "Hi," too.
I will.
Would you like to say hi,
Kevin?
Sure. I sold him
a ton of software.
I <i>was </i>their education business
for years.
You shouldn't be able
to take nonsense like that
and turn it into a patent,
and then fill up
the legal system,
and then create unlimited
uncertainty for companies.
It's wrong.
It's absolutely wrong.
I agree with you, mark.
I love him.
Steve, thanks.
Oh, my God. It's very good
to hear from you.
Here--here's the deal.
I got two offers on the table.
Uh, both from, uh, Kevin
and, un, Robert.
They're the same amount--
$500,000 for 15%,
which is what I asked for,
but they're insisting that I
include my other retail company.
I'm--I'm sorry. That's just
too much for this kind of offer.
I-I mean, I don't think
this Offer's good enough
for, you know, giving up,
you know, um,
you know,
what you've got going already.
What he's doing right now is,
he's trying to figure out,
is he serious about selling
the REAL business or not?
If I believe he will, maybe I'll
make him a real offer.
All right, come on back.
Ready or...
I-I don't wanna...
we were just talking bad
about you, but it's okay.
(laughs)
You can interrupt.
Um, you know, Steve says hi.
(grunts)
He doesn't know you. Sorry.
(daymond and Barbara) Ohh!
(laughs)
No, I'm kidding. I...
first, before I relay
Steve's comments, um,
would anyone else like
to, you know, reconsider?
Why don't you tell us
what woz said?
Woz, you know,
just thought that it was
an AWFULLY low offer for such
a well-established business.
Did woz agree, though,
that the only logical Play
was that it's one business,
not two businesses?
Um, you--we didn't talk
about that specifically,
although woz knew
what I was pitching
because I've discussed this
with him.
Your answer to $500,000 for 15%,
I'm taking it, is no.
Um, I-I wanted you give you
another opportunity
and, uh, you know...
to bid against himself?
Well, I mean, to--to rethink.
Why don't you counter?
I mean, to rethink the logic
of one m--
you know, Scott, the way
it works in the tank is,
we make an offer, you counter.
All right,
then let me be clear.
Kevin, you're out.
You're out.
I don't--I don't need you.
Wow.
You had $1 MILLION
sitting here.
Will your wife represent me in
suing you for wasting my time?
(laughs)
Because that's all you're doing
right now.
You didn't come to make a deal.
I didn't waste your time.
Don't waste ours.
(speaks indistinctly)
Hey, Scott. You know what?
Seriously, what the hell?
You point at me
and you tell me I'm out?
Uh... Bye-Bye.
(Robert) Show a little more
respect.
Ugh! That was exhausting.
That was painful.
As my mother always said,
the fish stinks from the head.
Why are we still
talking about it?
I went in looking for a deal.
I truly did.
But unfortunately,
the valuation that they put
on my other company...
combined Was just insulting.
I had no other choice.
I had to walk.
