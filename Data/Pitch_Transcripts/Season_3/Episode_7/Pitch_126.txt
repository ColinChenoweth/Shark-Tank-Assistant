Hi.
My name is Scott Jordan.
Scott, two days ago,
I'm flipping through the back
Scott, you're saying
that the proprietary patent,
which you say you have now...
yes, I do.
Is what you're selling me,
right?
Right.
Why aren't you bundling it
all together?
(mark, Barbara, and Scott laugh)
This is going to be wonderful.
I want it all, though.
Why are you just giving me
a taste,
when I want to eat
the whole pie?
But, Kevin, Kevin, hey.
Let's not get--let's--
I don't need you
for the other company.
Kevin. Kevin.
Kevin.
Yes, you do.
Oh. (chuckles)
I just don't.
The problem is,
there's leakage in the deal.
I don't get
any of the good stuff,
just the risky stuff.
No, it--
no, it's not risky.
So, Scott, what exactly is
the property that you own that
(daymond) Scott, the cases
you have defended have been
when--argument's sake,
let's say one of my designers--
Scott, just to be really clear,
you came up
with a fantastic idea.
You patented that idea.
Scott, Scott, just to be clear,
I'm out.
Scott, okay, so we're talking
about $1.2 million free cash?
Yeah.
What's a clothing company
trading at these days?
Let's call it five times?
No.
Why?
Inter--internet Clo--'cause
we're direct to consumer.
We're internet
clothing company.
What's it worth?
$30 Million.
$30 million?
$30 Million on--
who's insane now?
'cause it's growing
at 100% a year.
It has intellectual property.
That's where it's unique.
Scott, is--is there a premise
under which
you know, Scott, the way
it works in the tank is,
we make an offer, you counter.
All right,
then let me be clear.
Kevin, you're out.
You're out.
I don't--I don't need you.
Wow.
You had $1 MILLION
sitting here.
Will your wife represent me in
suing you for wasting my time?
(laughs)
Because that's all you're doing
right now.
You didn't come to make a deal.
I didn't waste your time.
Don't waste ours.
(speaks indistinctly)
Hey, Scott. You know what?
Seriously, what the hell?
