Hi. My name is Lyle schuette,
and I'm from Derby, kansas,
Lyle, what's
a dirt business?
I am a Terra firma RELOCATION
distribution Engineer.
(sharks laugh)
(chuckles) in other words,
I move a lot of dirt.
Lyle, how did your wife
hurt her back?
She fell in a hole of a pond
I was digging on our farm.
(laughs)
I knew it was dirt.
(chuckles)
I knew it.
You didn't do that
on purpose?
I told her to go left.
Lyle, you said you were
in home--Lowe's?
Lyle, what--
Lyle, the walmart
and Lowe's deal you had--
was that on a national basis
or just regional?
That was
my local two Lowe's stores
Lyle...
yes, sir?
I love you.
You're the first--
I love you, too, man.
(chuckles)
No, no. Let me tell you why.
Lyle, you got busy
with your dirt business,
Lyle, you saw a need
from your wife,
Lyle, I gotta tell you,
your heart's in it.
It's a good idea.
It fills a need,
but it's just tough
to write a check to somebody
Yeah.
Thank you, Lyle.
Thank you.
I thank all of you folks.
Have a great day.
All right.
(daymond and Barbara)
Good luck.
You, too, Lyle.
Good luck to you.
All right. Bye-Bye.
(chuckles)
What a great guy.
He is.
Yeah, a very nice guy.
One fun guy.
He should have let us invest
in his dirt business.
(chuckles)
I didn't get a deal today,
