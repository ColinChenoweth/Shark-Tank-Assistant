Hi. My name is Lyle schuette,
and I'm from Derby, kansas,
and my product
is the heat helper.
I am here today
to ask for $100,000
in exchange for 50% equity
in my product.
The heat helper is
an amazingly simple device.
It saves energy and money,
especially in times
when we need it now,
when the economy is tough.
I came up
with the heat helper
out of pure necessity.
(chuckles)
My wife had injured her back
and during her recovery
asked if there was any way that
I could raise the Dryer up
so when she did laundry
she wouldn't have to bend over
to get the clothes
in and out of the Dryer,
"and while you're at it,
can you heat up
that end of the house?"
now my mother--
she was a very smart woman.
Now I remember back home
on my parents' dairy farm
in wisconsin,
my mother would take
her old panty hose
and stick on the back
of the Dryer.
Why? Because she could catch
the heat and the humidity
that came out of the Dryer,
so during laundry day,
our home was
a lot more comfortable.
Now before I explain
how the heat helper works,
you must first understand
how an ELECTRIC Dryer Works.
An electric Dryer works
by pulling in air
through the back of the unit,
heating that air up.
Then it blows the air out
of your home.
What a waste.
Now what the heat helper does
is take that same amount of Air
that your Dryer uses,
filters it,
and then blowing it
back inside your home.
It pays for itself
in the first year.
I call the Heat helper...
(taps)
Common sense in a box.
(Robert chuckles)
Now Let's do some Business.
(mark, daymond,
and Robert laugh)
first question I have to ask is,
if my wife hurt her back
and I didn't volunteer to do
the laundry for her...
(Barbara laughs)
I'd be black and blue.
How did you get away
with that?
Well, I started
a dirt business,
and I'm normally gone
all day long,
and since my wife, at that time,
was a stay-at-home mom,
it was all right for her
to do that.
She--she cut you
some Slack, huh?
Yes, sir.
Lyle, what's
a dirt business?
I am a Terra firma RELOCATION
distribution Engineer.
(sharks laugh)
(chuckles) in other words,
I move a lot of dirt.
I'm a drainage contractor,
and I sell topsoil and compost.
Lyle, how did your wife
hurt her back?
She fell in a hole of a pond
I was digging on our farm.
(laughs)
I knew it was dirt.
(chuckles)
I knew it.
You didn't do that
on purpose?
I told her to go left.
No, I told her to go left,
and she went right,
and next thing I know,
there she was.
And then you made her do
the laundry.
(laughs)
Oh, god.
Dirt bites again.
So--
did you help her out
of the hole,
or did you build
something?
In the words of my wife,
she never saw
my old Butt move so fast.
Ah! (chuckles)
Have you had any sales?
I've had 680 units sold,
all through the web site.
How much does a unit cost?
$99, and--and we have sold 'em
at Lowe's and at walmart.
And how much can that save me
in my heating bill?
Well, an average family
of four will save
roughly $189 a year.
Lyle, you said you were
in home--Lowe's?
Lyle, what--
yes, we've been in Lowe's
for three years and in Walmart.
How many have you sold
in the last year?
Probably 20.
Why is that?
Why--why did you fall off
so dramatically?
I ended the company
in 2003,
because my dirt business
took off,
where I could not do both.
Lyle, the walmart
and Lowe's deal you had--
was that on a national basis
or just regional?
That was
my local two Lowe's stores
and my local walmart.
Okay.
We had to sell 'em
as a special order item.
They--until I sold--
did you try
to go national?
The response I got
when we did call is,
you need to sell
a certain amount of units,
and once you get
to that point,
They would consider 'em
to put me on the shelf.
So--okay, so that's where
We're getting.
Why do you feel that
the Units didn't sell?
Well, special order items mean
there's a display
at the store,
but you can't pick it up.
That's terrible.
You have to order it
that day...
Deadly. Mm-hmm.
And then he has to come back
in another day or two.
So great presentation, um,
but if Lowe's and those guys
couldn't really sell,
I don't want
to get into a space where
the professionals weren't
able to do it,
so I'm out.
Lyle...
yes, sir?
I love you.
You're the first--
I love you, too, man.
(chuckles)
No, no. Let me tell you why.
(mark, Barbara,
and Robert laugh)
You're the first guy
I've ever met that
made money selling dirt.
I sell manure, sir.
(chuckles)
Hey, if you can sell poo-poo
and make money,
that's fantastic...
yes, sir.
But it's not gonna be
a huge business,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Lyle, you got busy
with your dirt business,
and it kinda sat on the side,
and now you're here
showing it again,
bringing it back to life.
There's something used
and warmed up about it and over
that makes me uncomfortable.
(inhales deeply)
So I'd have to say
I am out.
Well, I never lost interest
in it, Barbara.
But you brought it back
from the dead.
I mean, to me--
it--yeah,
and--and the same unit
we have--I built for my wife
10 or 11 years ago,
we still use.
All the ones that
we have sold,
we haven't had one RETURN
or complaint,
because there's only
one moving part.
Lyle, you saw a need
from your wife,
and you created a product.
Not an investment right now.
(chuckles) I'm out.
Lyle, I gotta tell you,
your heart's in it.
It's a good idea.
It fills a need,
but it's just tough
to write a check to somebody
who's not eating, sleeping,
and breathing the business,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
Yeah.
Thank you, Lyle.
Thank you.
I thank all of you folks.
Have a great day.
All right.
(daymond and Barbara)
Good luck.
You, too, Lyle.
Good luck to you.
All right. Bye-Bye.
(chuckles)
What a great guy.
He is.
Yeah, a very nice guy.
One fun guy.
He should have let us invest
in his dirt business.
(chuckles)
I didn't get a deal today,
and that kinda disappoints me,
but, you know, life's too short.
Get over it, and it's all right.
I'm still coming home, Honey.
