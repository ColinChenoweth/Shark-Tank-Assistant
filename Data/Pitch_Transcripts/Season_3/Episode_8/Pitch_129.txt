I'm Rachael Mann,
and this is my sister
and business partner
Mackenzie Burdick...
and We're the creators
of litter jewelry
in San Francisco, california.
Growing up, we were always
creating and designing together.
We were always
really into fashion.
Maybe out
of different materials?
I studied interior design,
and Mackenzie studied
fashion design.
You know, we've always
just been creators.
Creating is just in our blood.
It's what we love to do.
(Mackenzie)
Making custom Jewelry
just kind of fell
into our laps.
I really wanted to create
a unique piece of jewelry
that would really make me
stand out for a special event,
and so I broke up
a necklace
and wore it in my hair
as a headpiece,
and the response was
unbelievable.
So we made 50 more,
and we entered them
in a trunk show here
in San Francisco
and sold out of
every single one of them.
And that's
when litter began.
We take vintage chain
and broken pieces
of costume jewelry,
and we make pieces
of body jewelry.
Our entire business is
just the two of us,
and we are working
around the clock...
pouring the resins,
sourcing the materials,
making all the original
hand molds in my Backyard.
Mackenzie's got
a New baby coming.
I have a young son.
We need somebody to come in
and just help us manage
all of this.
That's why we need
the sharks.
We need somebody who can focus
on the business side,
so that we can get
back into the creative area
and making new Collections.
We really want to be able
to capitalize
on a trend that we created.
Hi, sharks. I'm Mackenzie,
and this is my sister Rachael,
and we're litter.
We're san Francisco-based
jewelry and accessory designers.
We're here today seeking
$80,000
in exchange for a 51% stake
in our company.
Litter was started in 2009
when I broke up a necklace
and wore it in my hair
as a headpiece.
We were approached
by a friend
to make many more
of those headpieces
and sell them
in a local jewelry Show.
Rachael and I went around
to all the flea markets,
vintage stores,
Thrift stores in our area
and collected up chain.
We made 50 headpieces
and sold out at 150 bucks a pop.
With the money from the show,
we got a studio,
some materials,
and launched our web site.
Right away,
our designs were in demand,
and by 2010, we were selling
wholesale to retailers globally.
So we make headpieces,
ear cuffs,
jewelry that goes down
your legs,
which is just so sexy,
shoe jewelry, which can totally
transform the look of any shoe,
arm jewelry,
hands, which are awesome,
and we even make
chain mustaches.
(Robert and daymond laugh)
(Barbara) Oh, my God.
Why?
(laughs)
Paparazzi shields.
Paparazzi shields is
what we--
oh, wow.
No. They're great. Girl--
people at festivals,
music festivals--
they absolutely love them,
so...
our designs have
been featured
in all of
the top fashion magazines.
We've been worn by celebrities,
and all of this exposure
we got without one single dollar
being spent
on any advertising or P.R.,
and so we think
this is a perfect example
of how much bigger Litter
would get
if we had more TEAM members
managing our growth
and focusing
on aggressive sales.
How big is litter now?
What were sales last year?
What are they gonna be
this year?
Last year our sales were
$78,000,
and this year We're on track
for $150,000.
Why are sales so small?
I mean, this stuff is unique.
I haven't ever seen it before,
but only $150,000?
We're handmaking every single
piece ourselves right now,
and we just--
so how--
how much does
a typical piece cost,
and what's
your most expensive piece?
$100.
The average price is $100,
around $100.
And then what does it cost
you to make one?
About $2.
I have never seen a piece
like that.
This one?
That's, like, basically,
uh, chain mail,
for argument's sake.
Well, this--this piece
We're really proud of. We--
this took us a few hours
to make,
$20 in material,
and we just sold it
at a gallery for $1,600.
$1,600?
$1,600.
This is an example
of the kind of custom work
that we do for celebrities,
music videos.
Yeah.
We've been pulled
for, like, ke$ha, Ciara,
lady gaga,
and so that's like a--
what--do you have now--
I'm just trying
to understand this.
Do you have pending orders
that...
(Rachael) We do.
You can't keep up with?
Well, we just got picked up
by urban outfitters, and, um...
mm-hmm.
(Robert chuckles)
They are having us design
an EXCLUSIVE collection
for them.
And is there a minimum order,
Rachael, with them?
Are they guaranteeing
a certain order quantity?
Right now, it's a 400-piece
order and it's growing each...
Yeah, we have a 400-piece P.O.
And so it's gonna be a set?
And they're gonna see how
it goes, if it sells through?
(Rachael and Mackenzie)
Yes, exactly.
And go from there.
And you guys are making
everything by hand?
Everything.
That's craziness, right?
Everything.
Every piece by Hand.
So can somebody else
make these
or does it require that special
touch that you guys have?
Other people can make them.
Nope, the designs are set by us,
and then from there,
other people can
take it from there.
I'm trying to figure out
how to ramp this up.
'cause, I mean, it's hip,
it's--it's fashion.
You're the designer babes.
You need somebody behind you
or in front of you
that's selling this...
(Rachael) Absolutely.
And getting huge orders.
We would like the money
to go towards
hiring a great salesperson
and then maybe getting us
a great P.R. Agency that just
constantly is pushing us.
But--but wait a second. You've
done all this without any P.R.
I like that model.
Yeah, but think how much bigger
it could get.
Get back to manufacturing.
If I send one piece over to--
to a manufacturer,
is there any reason he can't
pound out 10,000 of them?
No.
There's no reason.
So you wanna work for somebody.
We're just looking for
the right partner
that knows what they're doing.
Yeah.
We just need to know the next
steps to take, you know?
It's just gotten bigger than us.
You guys are designers. That's
your special sauce, right?
Yeah, that really is
our special sauce.
And you guys wanna design.
Exactly.
And anything else that you do
takes your time away
from Designing.
Exactly.
So you want someone
to come in and say,
"guys, you do what you do,
right?
We'll take over the rest."
(Rachael and Mackenzie) Mm-hmm.
The challenge is--
here's kind of the catch-22.
We can't just come in
and work full-time, right?
No. Exactly. Exactly.
So you have to hire somebody
to come in and work full-time.
We understand,
mm-hmm.
Tell us how you would spend
the $80,000.
What--what do you have
envisioned?
I would like to hire a really
great salesperson initially,
and then also just ramp up
our web site.
Our web site could be
1,000% better.
Be able to handle
high--higher Volume.
Yeah.
Again, we all know
it's gonna take
more than $80,000 long run,
but initially, we think
that would be a good start.
You guys are walking proof of
concept. That's what happened.
You sold just enough
to make it interesting...
(Robert) right.
But not enough
to say it's a business.
Right.
I mean, it is so
on the tipping point
because you should be getting
$150,000 orders from somebody,
not $150,000 a year.
We need somebody
that is in sales
that has those department store
connections and web site--
I don't--I don't--I don't know
what to do with you guys.
I mean, I-I can give you money,
but I don't want to work
at your shop.
Yeah, I understand.
I want you to bring me
a package that says,
if you give me $180,000,
$250,000,
I can turn this into
a $10 million business.
Here's my plan.
Right.
If you told me that,
I'd probably
be very, very interested.
Because I like the stuff...
mm-hmm.
I like the story,
and I like you guys.
And I don't say that
very Often.
Can--
(chuckles) Thank you.
I should be beating you
with stick
for making the mistake
you've made.
But with your money,
we could be able to
spend less time hand-making each
piece and being able to fill--
no, I don't want you to
hand-make anything. I want you
to get somebody in China
to make 10,000 copies of it.
Exactly.
I-I don't have the passion
for the jewelry business...
(Rachael) Okay.
And I have a full-time job.
I-I-I can't help you find
that person.
I'm out.
All right.
What's the most popular piece
there
that sells the most?
Our leg chains
are really popular.
Mm-hmm.
Um, yeah.
What about that?
Is there another one
of a leg chain like that?
Yeah, this is called
a slim garter.
How much
does that sell for?
$120.
I'll take that. All right?
Do you have it in his size?
(Kevin) I want that
right off your leg.
What about the beard?
Can I see one of the beards?
I'd love to.
(Rachael) Yes, of course.
So you might have to, uh,
put these on.
Does that work?
(Rachael and Mackenzie) Yeah.
It better be a lot to make up
for what he's taking from you.
We would have to agree on it.
I mean, I would think--
what's a typical designer make,
daymond?
What kind of salary
are you willing to pay us?
It all depends
on--on the business.
A typical designer ranges
from $50,000 to $250,000.
(Robert) That's a big range.
Exactly.
We wanna be on the higher end.
Yeah, no kidding, right?
It all depends
on the designer.
I think that's all
in the details,
but right now,
what I'm willing to is
$80,000 for 70%.,
make you guys
the head designers.
If you want and you feel
you can run the company,
I'll go right back down
to the 51%.
Don't till you know
you have other offers coming.
But unfortunately, if you
entertain the other offers,
I'm gonna pull back.
Whoo.
