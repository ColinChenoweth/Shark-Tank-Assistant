The same people that buy
the ADJUSTABLE basketball Courts
are gonna buy a retail version
of this for $199.
You know what I love about you?
You are the best salesman,
but this is your $500 model
We're looking at,
the guy
with the ugly face, right?
Yes.
Excuse me?
You're here not to sell us
on this,
but to sell us on a $200 model,
but we don't see it?
Well, that's why I'm here.
I'm going to show you--it's--
but there's no prototype.
It's not going to be
much different.
See, the thing about
this is--
why wouldn't it be, at half
the price, much different?
We can use less costly materials
to make that.
It's going to be smaller,
with shipping and boxing.
But that explains
half the money difference?
That doesn't make sense.
I love you, but I'm out.
My name is Danny mastronardo,
and these are my brothers
and business partners.
We run
a successful family business
down here
in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Oh!
and when you see
four italian brothers,
you may think, a pizza shop,
a construction company
or something.
But in actuality,
we sell the world's best
skin care products.
We're a close-knit family,
and this business has
kept us together
and doing something that
we also love.
We make and formulate
all of our own products
in an office two minutes
from our parents' home.
We had an AMAZING response
from everyone Who's tried
our products,
and now our entire line
is available
at the most popular resort
in town, but that's not enough.
We know we've got a great
product that people love...
Hey, Gigi.
Gigi.
But we need the resources
to get it out there
and put it on a mass level.
We need help.
The sharks can give us
that investment that we want,
but more importantly,
be a mentor
and a partner that we need.
The brothers are
totally committed to making
Nardo's natural
a household name.
When the sharks see
our perseverance and passion,
they're gonna want to join
the Family.
Look out, sharks.
The nardo Brothers are
coming to you.
and these are my older brothers,
Danny, Kyle, and D.J.
We're the four brothers
behind Nardo's natural
organic skin care.
(Danny)
We are asking for $75,000
in exchange for 12%
of our company.
Nardo's natural is
an organic skin care line
With Ingredients derived
from nature.
We established nardo's natural
in 2009 and developed
our first moisturizer
in our kitchen.
Our organic products are used
during spa treatments
and also available
in retail
for consumers to take home
with them.
It is time to experience the spa
in the comfort of your own home.
And when you purchase
nardo's natural,
you become part of the family,
and you take the brothers
home with you.
(Robert and daymond laugh)
Very cute, guys.
My Oldest brother D.J.
Has a few products
to hand out for you guys.
Well, I know my wife
is gonna love this pitch.
(Kyle and Danny chuckle)
Everybody loves our pitch.
Thank you.
I-I just gotta know.
(chuckles)
Four good-looking,
normal guys...
(mastronardos chuckle)
How do you get
in the skin care business?
Well, D.J.'s our oldest brother,
and he toured the country
doing
a better health cooking show.
One day he burned himself
in front of a live show
in albuquerque, new mexico.
Our mother is a wound care
certified specialist,
so he called her up.
She said, "Well, what were
you doing over there?"
he goes, "I'm cooking
with Organic oils."
She said, "Okay, when
the burning sensation goes away,
"Put Those organic oils
on your skin.
It's gonna soothe
and hydrate."
A couple days later,
he's like, "This is fantastic.
I really thought
of something here."
He called upon the brothers,
and we reconvened,
and we all went down
to Florida
and said, "Let's start
a skin care line."
(laughs)
We bottled our first jar
in our kitchen,
and, uh, we literally
delivered across the street
after we had licensed
OUR business legally.
Are you guys gonna tell us
how much you've sold
of this stuff since 2009?
We actually have $30,000
to date of sales.
And you're
in one location now?
We're in several locations
right now, but we decided to--
how many is several?
How many is several?
17.
How much do you have
invested in the company?
Over $35,000.
And what are you guys doing now?
Each one of you guys have a job?
I am full-time with
the business, as well as Danny.
The other two brothers--
Keith--
I work in corporate America.
I'm providing
the cash flow to s--
to keep this company afloat.
How do the two of you live
on that small income, $30,000?
We actually--we are comfortable
to live for a year and a half
without taking any money
from our business.
How big do you think
you can be,
and what's it gonna take
to get there?
We're gonna project
$4.8 million in 2 years.
How many?
Mm.
$4.8 million
fr--two years from today.
Whoa.
Let me just tell you,
project--
from--from $30,000
to $4.8 million?
Uh, exactly. I'll explain,
if you don't mind.
Walk us through
how that's gonna happen.
We are planning
to land 100 accounts in 2 years.
Listen, I don't want
to give you bad news here,
but I'm gonna tell you
something.
There are thousands
of Nardo's out there.
Why is it gonna be<i>you</i>
that they select?
Why not somebody else?
We're already being requested
for more accounts right now
we cannot supply.
And can you tell me what it
costs you to make that product
and what you sell it for?
An average cost--
the average markup
on each product is 600%.
Kyle, the margins are
incredible,
but--but here's my issue
with it.
You got four guys that look
like a singing group...
(k.J. Chuckles)
Waiting for that.
Terrible voices.
(laughs)
Now if I may interject
just a moment, uh,
we are four workhorses,
and that's what you're getting.
You're getting a package
of four in one,
but also, as I said,
we're gonna hit up, uh,
over a hundred accounts.
In those two years,
we did the math.
That's 7.3 Days.
Basically, if each of us can
close one account a month...
that's one account.
Look, let me--let me
give you some reality.
You've had a year.
You've only sold
$30,000 worth in that year.
Why haven't you sold
those hundred businesses?
Why next year instead
of this year?
We just don't have the capital
to actually manufacture.
We need $75,000 just to produce
the product. That's all--
but have you gone to a bank
at all? Have you tried--
Yes.
Do you guys have
credit cards?
We've gone to a bank
for personal credit cards.
We've been turned down.
(Kevin) No bank is gonna lend
these guys any money.
That's why they're in
the shark tank.
Exactly, but nobody's getting
money in this depressed economy.
What is the most brutally
competitive industry on earth?
Cosmetics. Do you know why?
There's only one other guy
that has better margins,
and that's a drug dealer,
all right?
(chuckles)
You've got to get this brand
out there.
You need millions of dollars.
How is that gonna happen?
That $4.8 million in sales is
a hundred accounts in 2 years.
That's one brother a month
landing an account.
Kyle, you keep--you know what?
You keep saying...
very Achievable.
"A hundred accounts.
A hundred accounts."
How many businesses you think go
from $30,000 to $4.8 million?
So let me ask
the--the zillion-dollar
question.
How much do you have
in unfilled orders?
Uh, a few thousand Dollars.
$6,000.
Oh, man, Kyle.
Okay, listen,
that's a bad number.
Because they will not land
until we can perform.
If we don't have the product,
they won't come through with us.
If this c--if this product
was so phenomenal
that everybody was
demanding it
and it was flying off
the shelves,
someone would reach
into their pocket.
I'm out.
What's that?
(Kyle) These are
testimonials from people
who have experienced
our product.
This is a-a letter
for 1600 pennsylvania ave.
The president
and the first lady
thanked us
for a wonderful product.
Let me see that.
(snorts)
Okay, let me read this.
(chuckles)
"The White House, Washington.
We would like to extend
"Our deepest thanks
and appreciation
"For your generous gift.
"We hope you will continue
to stay active and Involved.
Thank you again
for your kind gift."
(Robert) What does that mean?
This isn't--
"Please send $2,000
for my reelection."
(mark laughs) Yeah. Exactly.
This is totally generic, guys.
(Barbara) Absolutely.
Well, guys, let me--
let me just--
it means they're polite.
Let me just say something.
Uh, I believe in your story
as the four individuals,
because when I started, it was
myself and three other guys.
The beauty of it was,
at any given time,
four of us was someplace doing
something for the company,
and I think that that
was the basis to my success.
But, you know, I think
it's a little too early, uh,
so with that being said,
I'm out.
I'd like to tell you
what I don't like
about your business.
(Kyle) Sure.
Your projection
of $4.8 million in sales
with no justification,
really, on how
you could possibly get there,
really makes us
have to be almost a little
foolish to believe.
I respect that.
The other is, I don't like
your name, "Nardo,"
to be honest with you.
Well--
(Barbara)
Is that your last name?
No, our full last name
is Mastronardo.
That's even worse.
(men laugh)
No, you know, there's--
something about "Nardo" Sounds--
Yeah, that is bad.
It goes--uh, forgive me,
but it's not your real name,
so I don't feel bad
telling you.
And last, you know what I love?
Your stupid naivete.
(chuckles)
I've never seen
a young entrepreneur succeed
without great naivete,
and for that,
I'm gonna make an offer.
The contingency is...
okay, wait.
Before you make an offer...
wait.
Let me make an offer.
(Kyle) We're not asking
for your money for a handout.
We just need a little bit
of work, and, uh, trust me--
man, I love you guys.
We got some drive, man.
I--but--
so make them an offer.
I-I can't...
(exhales deeply) I c--
(Danny)
give it to him, Keith.
Show him the face.
(sharks laugh)
please?
It's a great face.
Uncle Robert.
(chuckles) "Uncle Robert."
You're part
of the family now, Robert.
I can't do it
with the value.
I... I'm out.
(Kevin) You're down to Barbara.
You've got an offer--
$75,000 for 50%
of your business.
I think she's being way
too generous.
I would never offer you that.
But what are you gonna do
with it?
Why don't we go take
a minute?
Can we just take a minute?
(daymond and Kevin)
Take a minute.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
(exhales deeply)
All right, guys.
We're in a situation here...
come on.
And we have to really
pay attention and focus
on what we want to do.
Huddle.
Listen, this is--
We've put a lot of time...
guys--
and energy
into this product.
Half our business, man?
That's a lot, guys.
Need to really be smart
about this.
Try one counteroffer
and see what she says.
Well, if she'll listen.
What if she--what if she says
$100,000 at 50%?
She's willing--
she's willing to open up.
I can't wait.
I hope they take the deal.
I can't wait to show you
they're gonna succeed.
Those are great guys,
but I'm just--Barbara--
and that's why
they'll succeed.
(all)
one, two, Three. Nardo's!
All right, guys,
So Barbara offered you $75,000
for 50% of the business.
And we've, uh, taken
a few minutes to really Think
about that...
and we welcome you
to the Family.
Wow. Great.
Come on down here!
(mark) Congratulations.
(daymond) All right.
You won't regret it.
(speaks indistinctly)
(speaks indistinctly) Cool.
Thank you so much.
We don't shake hands.
We hug.
You feel better than
you look.
Yeah. (chuckles)
You're family now, so...
I-I need a squeeze a day.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
(mark and daymond)
Good luck, guys.
(Kyle and k.J.) whoo!
There we go, baby.
Go on and take that, homey.
Nardo's alive.
That was awesome.
That was awesome.
Barbara, are you gonna make them
take their shirts off
and do a calendar?
No, I'm not that type.
(laughing)
No, she'll just make 'em
take their shirts off
and not do the calendar.
Cut it out, guys.
Gettin' dirty.
Oh, Barbara.
You just blew $75,000.
No, I didn't.
I can't wait
to show you, Kevin.
When we went through
with the deal
and Barbara came on board
and there were
four brothers here,
we were like, "Let's welcome
a sister into the group."
It was the BEST feeling ever.
As you put it on,
you have to kind of adjust it.
(laughs)
(Kevin) He can go incognito
tonight.
(laughter)
That is so perfect for Kevin.
You're putting it
on the wrong guy.
That is cool.
(Robert)
daymond, what are you doing?
Well, you...
okay, so here's the deal.
This is basically
what we call in Our business
a designer offer.
And the designers normally,
the top end of a deal
is they get 35%
because they're
just designers.
Now I will give you
the $80,000...
for 70%.
(Barbara) 70%?
But what if we're willing
to do the work? Like...
then I will let you
buy back in
to acquire what
you initially asked for.
$80,000 for 70%. Wow.
(Kevin)
it doesn't make any money.
(Barbara)
You know, daymond, you w--
(daymond) it does make money.
You would never make that offer
to a male designer. No way.
Ohh. No, come on.
Oh, here comes her crap.
Whoa! B-Barb...
say what you want.
Look, guys--guys, here's part
of the challenge.
It's the truth.
And I'm gonna
sell myself here.
Part of this challenge is,
now you still have to figure out
how to pay yourselves.
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
So it's $80,000
for 70% of your company.
But you will also
get salaries as well.
So you'll have salaries
and you'll have profit.
Well, you better ask
about the salary, girls.
