My name is Tony Devine,
and I'm from
Bristol, pennsylvania.
My product is going
to revolutionize the way
we train for basketball.
Finish! Finish!
Oh, let's go.
Use that left hand!
I've been a basketball coach
my entire life...
Let's go!
And I always felt like
there was something missing,
and that was the realism
when you practiced.
So one day I'm in the backyard
working out with my son.
The kid is
a very good basketball player,
but there's one thing
that I notice.
He's a great shooter
when Nobody's in his face,
and it hits me.
The lightbulb goes off,
and within a week
I had a ROUGH prototype ready
to bring out onto the court.
And I'm telling you,
within ten minutes
he was shooting better
than He has ever shot before,
so I know I have something that
is going to be huge.
I think the Sharks are gonna
love it.
How are you guys doing today?
My name is Tony Devine,
and my product is
the original profender.
I'm seeking
a $75,000 investment
for a 15% stake
in my business.
let me say that again--
the<i>only</i>mobile training device
in the world that simulates
a closeout defender.
Since most coaches are
built like me,
kinda sloppy
and out of shape,
it makes it very difficult
for us
to close out on our players
and give 'em a realistic look,
but when you incorporate
the original profender
into any workout,
you're going to make
that coach or that owner feel
like a star again,
because now they're going to be
able to contest every shot.
This is my son Devon.
This is who inspired me
to come up with the idea,
and we're going to show you
exactly why this thing
is going to be in every gym
and on every driveway
in the country.
All right. Here we go.
Boom! Right on you.
Here we go.
It's gonna raise up.
Give me that.
Boom! Here we go.
Get it up!
(grunts)
All right.
Now with your help,
I'm gonna be able to put
the original profender
in the hands
of Every basketball player
around the world
and give them the opportunity
to stop pretending
and start Profending.
Whoo! Love it, baby! Whoo!
All right, baby. Let's go!
All right!
All right.
Let me see if they work.
All right.
That's what I like to see.
Now, mark, instead of using
the original profender,
I'm gonna give you...
(sharks laughing)
(daymond) ohh!
The original offender.
Now do you sell that
to farms as a scarecrow?
(Kevin) Oh, I love it.
Here we go.
Come on. Here's what you do.
(Barbara) Oh, you guys.
Oh! I'm so sorry!
(sharks laugh)
Here we go. One shot.
Here we go.
I'm gonna need to do
the fadeaway.
Boom!
(cheers and applause)
That was too easy.
That was too easy.
I'm gonna give you
the more Younger, virile
original offender.
This is when he had hair
and he was good.
(daymond) Yeah!
(sharks Laughing)
Look at this guy.
Here we go.
Whenever you're ready.
Whenever you're ready,
coach.
Give me that.
Ohh.
There we go.
(Kevin) Ohh.
Okay, wait, wait.
I want to get one more shot,
just 'cause he's so ugly,
I can't let him stop me.
(laughs)
Give me that.
(cheering)
(laughs)
(Robert) Whoo! Tony...
All right.
Is there a product like this
on the market today?
There are other things,
but they're not dynamic.
Well, how do you do it
today, mark?
How do the pros do it?
(chuckles)
the Younger coach puts up
a Broom.
Seriously?
There's value, right.
Having to shoot
over the higher hands--
no question, there's value.
The question is,
is it big enough to be
a big business?
Do you have any sales
of this thing?
I have $25,000 in sales
over the first year,
but I don't want you to get
caught up in that number,
'cause I went to--
oh, you never do,
but, listen,
while we're caught up in it...
Yeah.
Who did you sell them to?
I packed up a truck
with a bunch of my friends.
Anywhere we could drive,
we brought our profenders
and sold them.
I brought this thing to
las vegas for U.S.A. Basketball.
I got this thing down
on the floor.
I'm rolling this
at Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant says, "This thing
is gonna be big real soon.
I just can't wait to--to be
the first one to buy it."
But<i>did</i>he buy it?
Did he buy it?
Do you know
how impossible it is
to try to get in touch
with these guys?
(sharks laughing)
You had him right there.
You had him right there.
They got rid of us.
They kicked us off.
Tony, how much do
they cost?
They cost--right now
they're $499.95.
500 bucks?
They're 500 bucks.
It's 500 bucks
for that thing?
It's 500 bucks.
Mark, you own a team.
Would you pay 500 bucks
for this?
The NBA teams can
afford it.
Probably the bigger division I
schools can afford one,
maybe several.
But the challenge is
once you go beyond there,
because, you know,
your typical family
That's just got, you know,
a pop-up hoop like this
in the driveway,
c-can they afford it?
This is gonna be
a 2-pronged attack.
There's gonna be
the industrial/commercial
That's for the, uh,
basketball pro grades to--
the $500 one?
Exactly. That's
the more customized one.
That's $499. That's not where
we're gonna make our money.
That's not where
it's gonna happen.
Where are we gonna make
our money?
This is where
We're gonna make our money.
Where?
Tony, I don't really see
the market, at that price point,
as a large consumer product.
I'm out.
I think it's a great idea,
but, literally, $500--
I know a guy in the Hood
that will guarantee...
(laughs)
To come to your house
every day
for the rest of your life
for $500 and guard you...
(laughs)
and your<i>entire</i>family...
(laughs)
and he's tall.
(sharks laughing)
Okay. This is what
I need you to do, though.
You guys are all getting
caught up in the $500.
You're not l--you're not
listening to what I'm saying.
I'm out.
First of all, I think those are
the best-looking profenders
I've ever seen.
(laughs)
You've done a great job
with them,
but for me, the biggest question
is size of market,
and I think there's
a huge challenge, even at $200.
As a business, I don't see it.
I'm out.
Isn't the only guy on this panel
that you really need mark?
Mark, you can't go out on me.
Listen, I'm gonna tell you why.
This is Why. When I see you,
I see myself. I'm not lying.
When I see you,
I see myself.
You got a ton of money,
but money doesn't move you.
What moves you is
the journey to get there,
the push to get there.
That's what I'm about.
I'm gonna get there.
Mark, what are you
gonna do?
You know I love you,
everybody loves you, right?
Okay, listen,
before you go out...
okay.
'cause I hear
that going out...
(exhales deeply)
This is what you have
to understand.
With your help, it is going
to be on every driveway,
in every backyard, and it's
gonna be in every gym.
With my help,
it probably could be,
and that's one
of the unfortunate scenarios.
I don't have an unlimited number
of hours in the day.
I'd have to be able to call
the head coaches.
I'd have to be able to call
the athletic Directors.
Time is the most precious asset
that I have,
and unfortunately,
I don't see the reward.
For that reason, I'm out.
So Everybody's out?
All right, guys.
Dev, let's roll, son.
Absolutely I'm disappointed,
but just like I tell my son,
it's not whether you win
or lose.
It's, did you leave
everything you had
on the court or on the field?
Which I did.
