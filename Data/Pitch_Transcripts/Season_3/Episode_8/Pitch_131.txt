Hi. My name's
Todd Colby pliss,
Todd, what are your sales today?
Our sales so far this year
have been about $25,000,
but we just had all
our disclosure documents done
for the franchises.
What does a granny get paid?
What's a granny going for
these days?
It depends what
they're gonna do.
I'd say, here in Los Angeles,
it's about...
anywhere from $14 to $20.
Other cities
it might be a little lower.
But what are babysitters
charging, so I can compare?
Oh, okay. Babysitters are
usually getting
anywhere from, like,
$10 to $13.
So grannies are
more expensive?
Yeah, but you're getting
decades of experience.
you know, I gotta tell you
something, Todd.
That sounds, like, really thin.
You're actually acquiring
the customer,
That doesn't make sense
to me, Todd.
Well, now let's just punch
some numbers, Todd.
Average Babysitting session--
five hours.
Top-in Grannie--20 Bucks.
Get $100.
My Vig's 15%.
I make 15 bucks off of granny.
That's not enough.
I gotta squeeze granny big-time.
Todd, the margin on granny
sucks.
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Kevin, let him finish.
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.
15 bucks a day. He's--he's--
yeah, but let me tell you,
Kevin,
we're getting paid a minimum
up-front,
so it's not just
the $10 a day.
You're getting $1,200 to $2,400
from the, uh, client that's--
that's hiring the Granny.
Right.
Todd, what is
your minimum commitment
from the client?
If it's a temporary,
which means 90 DAYS or less,
we're usually gonna get
at least $1,200.
What happens
if the granny quits
or dies halfway
through the assignment?
(laughs)
Okay,
in our placement agreement,
we have
a replacement guarantee.
look, Todd.
You're doing $25,000.
You're a long way away
from franchising.
I'm out.
Todd, I think you have
a, uh, a smart name.
I love the name.
I just don't like
the numbers, Todd.
Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.
Good luck, Todd.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Appreciate it.
All the best.
You have to admit one thing.
He found
an UNTAPPED labor Force.
Unless you franchise this
very, very quickly...
but I don't want to be
that early,
'cause it's gonna take
a lot of work.
That insurance--
That's way too early.
