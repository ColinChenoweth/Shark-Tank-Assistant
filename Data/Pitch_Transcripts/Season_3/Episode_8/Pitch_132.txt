Hi. My name's
Todd Colby pliss,
and my company is
a revolutionary new Concept
in Quality
domestic staffing Needs.
Introducing rent-a-grandma.
(sharks laugh)
I am looking for $150,000
for 20% of my business.
Has this ever happened
to you--
you've hired a kid from down
the street to babysit
only to find out that texting
is the focus of their day,
rather than your child?
This is not
the best solution,
and you should not have
to settle for it.
Wouldn't it be great
to have a Loving caregiver
just like your grandma,
one who's--
one who concentrates...
(chuckles)
On the<i>kids</i>
and not electronics?
And who knows? Maybe she
can even bake Cookies.
Thank you, grandma.
(Kevin) Thanks, Granny.
Nana, you shouldn't have.
(woman chuckles)
Perfect.
(mark and daymond)
Thank you.
After hearing Horror Story
After horror story,
I knew there had to be
a better way,
and I thought to myself,
who's the most experienced,
who's the most trustworthy
when it comes to watching
the children, the households,
and, yes, even baking
delicious cookies?
And it hit me---
grandma on all counts.
Which would you rather have,
this... or this?
Don't ask daymond.
(chuckles)
How long have you been
in business?
Well, we've been in business
since late last year.
We have about 50 grandmas
in Los Angeles.
(chuckles)
Uh, we're getting
an incredible amount
of calls and e-mails,
uh, from around the country.
Word of mouth is spreading,
people that want to hire
grandmas.
It's been
pretty overwhelming.
What's your office like?
Do you have a bunch of grannies
sitting around drinking scotch
and smoking...
(laughing)
(laughs)
Waiting to get assignments?
(continues laughing)
Uh, not quite like that.
Todd, what are your sales today?
Our sales so far this year
have been about $25,000,
but we just had all
our disclosure documents done
for the franchises.
What does a granny get paid?
What's a granny going for
these days?
It depends what
they're gonna do.
I'd say, here in Los Angeles,
it's about...
anywhere from $14 to $20.
Other cities
it might be a little lower.
But what are babysitters
charging, so I can compare?
Oh, okay. Babysitters are
usually getting
anywhere from, like,
$10 to $13.
So grannies are
more expensive?
Yeah, but you're getting
decades of experience.
Most of them are
actual grandmas.
They know how to handle
situations.
They're really wonderful
with the kids.
So how can I make a buck off
of granny? How does this work?
Our clients sign
a placement agreement with us,
and we're getting a fee
up-front.
We charge
between 12% and 15%
of what the granny's
gonna get paid.
So you're saying We're only
getting 15% of Granny's take?
Uh, Well, yeah, but you're
being paid up-front
for whether
it's six months or--
you know, I gotta tell you
something, Todd.
That sounds, like, really thin.
You're actually acquiring
the customer,
and you're only making 15%.
Well, in the industry,
it's usually about 12% to 15%,
and don't forget,
once they're placed,
we're really not doing
a lot.
The response has
just been--
we have literally,
in the last two months,
got in over 400 requests
for franchise information.
But Why would anybody
franchise something
with only $25,000 in sales?
That doesn't make sense
to me, Todd.
What value do you bring?
There's no brand rent-a-granny.
I've never heard of this
before.
We're trademarked, and that's
'cause we're brand-New.
Well, now let's just punch
some numbers, Todd.
Average Babysitting session--
five hours.
Top-in Grannie--20 Bucks.
Get $100.
My Vig's 15%.
I make 15 bucks off of granny.
That's not enough.
I gotta squeeze granny big-time.
I need more dough.
Right, and that's exactly
what I was gonna say.
We're--our placements
are usually
6 to 12 Months or longer...
so we're charging
for the year,
and there's a minimum,
so our--
Todd, the margin on granny
sucks.
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Kevin, let him finish.
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.
15 bucks a day. He's--he's--
yeah, but let me tell you,
Kevin,
we're getting paid a minimum
up-front,
so it's not just
the $10 a day.
You're getting $1,200 to $2,400
from the, uh, client that's--
that's hiring the Granny.
Right.
Todd, what is
your minimum commitment
from the client?
If it's a temporary,
which means 90 DAYS or less,
we're usually gonna get
at least $1,200.
What happens
if the granny quits
or dies halfway
through the assignment?
(laughs)
Okay,
in our placement agreement,
we have
a replacement guarantee.
We will, uh, replace them
with up to three grandmas,
so if someone doesn't work out
for some reason...
(laughs)
(chuckles) Granny dies,
and in comes a new one...
if granny drops dead...
like the pet,
like the family pet?
Or the kids--
the kids stuff her
in the trunk...
(sharks laughing)
"Myrtle, put your wig on.
I got a job for you."
We're gonna--
we're gonna send out
three more women--
you don't need to finish that,
because with That--
cute idea. I'm out.
Okay, but, uh, you know,
with our franchises--
look, Todd.
You're doing $25,000.
You're a long way away
from franchising.
I'm out.
Todd, I think you have
a, uh, a smart name.
I love the name.
Thank you, and that's
trademarked, by the way.
Really clever,
but I have to say, this just
isn't my type of business.
I'm out.
Okay.
I just don't like
the numbers, Todd.
If you came back
and said to me,
"look, I can get granny
for 50 cents on the dollar,"
now you're talking.
(chuckles)
then I'd be interested,
but you're not, so I'm out.
I think you have a good idea.
I actually like it.
I think it's a brand
you can build,
but it's gonna be
very difficult to scale...
(chuckles) and honestly
I don't want to be in
the rent-a-grandma business,
um, so I'm out.
Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.
Good luck, Todd.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Appreciate it.
All the best.
You have to admit one thing.
He found
an UNTAPPED labor Force.
Unless you franchise this
very, very quickly...
but I don't want to be
that early,
'cause it's gonna take
a lot of work.
That insurance--
That's way too early.
