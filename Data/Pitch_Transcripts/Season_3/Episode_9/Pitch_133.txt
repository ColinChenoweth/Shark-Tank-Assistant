Hi. My name is aviv grill.
I am the C.E.O. Of miso media,
and today I'm going to show you
why our company is going
to fundamentally change
digital music education.
I'm looking for $300,000
for 5% of the company.
Oh.
(Kevin) Miso Baby.
Hope you have some sales.
Me so greedy.
We--we'll get into that.
Yeah, I bet we will.
(laughs)
Um, so there are a lot
of different aspects
to the company
that we have.
The first Commercial application
that we had
launched in June.
And it's an ipad and iphone app
called miso music.
And it teaches people
how to play, uh, the guitar,
ukulele, Bass,
banjo and Mandolin.
Uh, and I'm gonna
show you that right now.
So, uh, there are a couple
different ways
that the app can be used.
Uh, let's say you don't have
a real instrument.
You can use a virtual instrument
that we have in the app.
I'm gonna use
a koaloha ukulele.
You wanna select
right here.
And I'm gonna play a song
that I really enjoy
called "Be ok"
By Ingrid Michaelson.
So the way that this works
is the notes scroll down
the face of the guitar
similar to a game
like guitar hero.
And when it hits
the yellow tempo bar,
you're supposed to play.
(plays melody)
But Let's say I want to do it
using a real instrument.
We have, uh,
these adapters,
which allow you to plug your
guitar directly into the ipad.
And I'm gonna play
the same song,
except this time I'm going
to grab the ukulele.
So I'm going to come
over to here,
and it should show up
on the back.
(plays melody)
So I can't really
do this song Justice.
Uh, so I've actually
brought with me
Ingrid Michaelson to perform
her hit song herself.
(laughs)
Oh, my gosh.
Great.
So can you come out here?
? Ta-da ?
(laughs)
Hi.
(Barbara and Kevin) Hi.
(daymond) Hey.
(playing "Be ok")
? I just want to be ok,
be ok, be ok ?
oh, wow.
? I just wanna be okay today ?
(mark) Yeah. Whoo!
? Open me up
and you will see ?
? I'm a gallery
of broken hearts ?
? and let me hold
my broken parts ?
Aviv, so very smart
to bring Ingrid here
to help sell your product.
Thank you.
She's also an advisor
to the company.
And damn, she can sing.
What's your background?
Are you a musician?
My Dad's a recording engineer,
my mom's an opera Singer.
Uh, I worked in entertainment.
So this is your first...
it's my first
tech Company. Yeah.
So, uh, yeah.
We debuted this technology.
Afterwards, we closed
an INVESTMENT round
led by google ventures.
What percentage of investment
did google take?
Uh, google did $100,000.
Uh, we had people LIKE
Justin Timberlake
Come on board, as well,
uh, in the company.
Oh, drop a few names, maybe?
(laughs)
Let's talk about
a couple of things here--
do I have to be
a hardcore musician?
Can I just be a Hacker?
What am I?
Who's your customer?
Well, uh, you know,
it's both.
We want to be able
to target the casual musician,
people who just want
to learn more music.
You know, sheet music
sells in this country.
It's a $600 million a year
industry.
It's $600 million?
In the United States alone.
Are you selling--
are you selling scripts?
Selling sheet music?
Yes, absolutely.
So we have, you know,
a whole store
where you can do
in-app purchases.
What are the sales
today, aviv?
So in the past month,
we've had 80,000 downloads.
So when you say "Download,"
what are we downloading?
So the app--
the ipad app.
Ipad app, okay.
And the app I'm downloading
was the one that'll let you
play the Music.
Exactly.
And how much is it?
Uh, the app is free.
How do you get revenue
off that,
or is there
any revenue today?
There is.
So we have
in-app purchases.
So you can buy sheet music
from a variety of artists.
We have a huge catalog
of sheet music
which is growing every day.
We're converting
about 8% of our users
into paying customers,
which is...
and what--what are
they paying for,
the sheet music
or an upgraded app?
They're paying
for the sheet music.
So we're looking
to not just have customers
Come on board
and buy one song.
We're looking
to retain customers,
to have people
who come back regularly...
hmm.
And buy music from us.
So--so the idea is,
you're making an app,
it's cool, it's fun,
people come to it
as a community,
and then, when they're there,
you're going to
sell them sheet music.
Exactly.
So you just found
a clever way
to go after
a traditional market.
Exactly, and we've also created
some pretty profound technology.
But you're not gonna sell that.
It's just--it's all
part of the packaging.
Exactly. So, you know,
digital sheet Music
distribution
has not been
particularly successful.
And the reason--
Well, it's not sexy.
You've made it sexy.
Exactly.
Now you're valuing
the company at $6 million.
Yes.
Where are you getting
that value from?
Well, I mean, most people
look at a company
and you base valuation
on traction or technology.
What was the last round
of investment done at?
Uh, the last one was done
at a $3 million valuation.
So why... why do I have
to pay twice as much?
I mean, we have
a lot more software.
A huge amount
more software.
When was the last round done?
Uh, the last round
closed in december.
So we're talking
six months later
and the company's
doubled in value?
Yes.
Throw me a bone, miso.
Why would you say that it
doubled in value in six months?
Yeah.
How would you justify that?
Well, I mean, I think that
the second
that Justin Timberlake
and google came on board,
the value raised.
Does it work
for every instrument,
or it's Only
stringed instruments?
Well, this app is
only stringed instruments.
We're actually working on
standard music notation
right now, which will go
across all platforms.
And our note detection
technology
works across
all instruments.
(mark) and what did you say
your revenue was?
Uh, so we've had--
for the sheet music sales,
we've had 35,000 downloads.
Uh, it equates to about
$40,000, uh, in sales.
So this is why it doesn't
make sense here.
You have incredible artists.
You also have google
and people who have money.
Right?
Mm-hmm.
You have something out
for $1.2 million,
and you're insulting us
with an offer of 5%.
You don't really want
to make a deal here, do you?
No, I would love to.
I-I think that you guys are all
really brilliant investors.
And I'd love
to have you guys on board.
Then why is it 5%?
There is something
fishy here,
because you have
everything you need.
So this is why
it doesn't make sense here.
You have incredible artists.
You also have google
and people who have money,
right?
Mm-hmm.
You have something out
for $1.2 million.
And you're insulting us with
an offer of 5%.
You don't really want to
make a deal here, do you?
No, I would love to.
I-I think that you guys are all
really brilliant investors,
and I'd love to have
you guys on board.
Then why is it 5%?
There is something
fishy here,
because you have
everything you need.
And I don't want
to waste my time,
so I'm out.
May I? I just want to clear
the deck a little bit here.
I've been burned
by Technology businesses
many times before,
and they go through money
WAY too fast.
I'm out.
Okay. So let me try to
understand exactly what you own.
Yeah.
Right. Did you develop
the software involved here?
Yes.
Okay.
Everything's been
developed ourselves.
Do you own the I.P.
On all the code?
Uh, we do.
I look at this
as, like, an option.
You've got an interesting
platform here.
I have no idea if
you'll be successful or not.
But so far,
it looks pretty good.
I think that We're going
to be the leaders
in Digital music education.
I mean, it's been a field
that hasn't had success.
But there hasn't really
been an interactive way
for people to be able
to learn music online.
Let me throw
something out here.
'cause to me, you know,
I-I like guitar,
I like Ingrid. I like you.
Google options you--they give
you 100 grand just to say,
"Who the hell knows What's gonna
happen with this guy?
Let's throw some money at him."
That's how I feel.
So I'll offer you $100,000,
which is an option amount,
but I want 3 1/3%.
In other words,
it's the same valuation
as the last round.
Will somebody else--
he's asking for $300,000.
You gotta stick
with $300,000.
I have $100,000 I want
to throw at him. That's all.
He has to raise
the other $200,000.
Oh, no!
What a problem.
(laughter)
So you want the same value
as before,
and you want aviv
to go out and...
You're a smart guy, Robert.
Well, you want aviv to go out
and get the other $200,000
from another two sharks?
That's why they call it
work, my friend.
So you understand what
he's saying to you right now?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's a smart guy.
Who's left on this deal?
Mark, you're in still?
I know he's smart.
I'm still--
I'm still evaluating.
I mean, I'm not really
interested
in doing it
at the last valuation.
I mean, we have other money
on the table, as well.
So this is--honestly, it has
less to do...
Well, that's a bit
of a problem.
'cause I didn't need
to go in with Kevin.
I was gonna offer you
the entire $300,000
if you'd consider the same
value as you took initially.
I-I mean...
so $300,000 for 10%.
Yeah. We have money
on the table.
The reason why I want
you guys to come on board
is 'cause I want
strategic investors.
Well, if you have money
on the table,
why would you be here?
Because I want you guys.
Okay, well you got me.
$300,000 for 10%.
I'm having a problem
having to pay twice as much
as some guys did, basically,
when you closed it
probably 90 days ago.
Um, I mean, I can do...
I can do the $300,000...
for 7% equity.
Which...
you're only
300 basis points away
from where We need to be.
Uh...
the Real issue behind this is if
I lower the VALUATION too much,
it--it's gonna hurt me
on the other end
while I'm raising
the rest of this money.
I offered you
the $300,000 for 10%.
Um...
aviv, I'm not gonna
match that offer.
I'm out.
Aviv, what is the thing
that's gonna accelerate you
to where it's
a very big enterprise?
Well, music education is
a $9 billion a year industry.
Right.
That's a--
that's a huge market.
Do you see being able to charge
for a premium version
and upsell people?
That's something that
we had actually talked about.
We've always stated
that the app is free
for a limited time
when we first launched.
Right.
Uh, so yeah,
I-I would--I definitely
am leaving it open to that.
Yeah, I-I've got
a better understanding now.
So what I'm willing to do
is the $300,000
for 8%.
Are you doing
the whole $300,000 yourself?
I'll do the whole $300,000
myself, Yeah.
It's a no-brainer.
Okay. I'll do the same terms.
I'll do $100,000 of it.
If he doesn't wanna let me in,
that's cool, too.
But you may wanna have
as many sharks as you can.
Particularly ones that
can actually play something.
(laughs) Hey, I actually
play a few instruments.
Maybe not well, but I play.
Not well. I-I heard you.
(laughs)
I'll do half of it.
Obviously, I'd love
to do a deal with you.
You don't need Kevin.
You'd rather work
with me...
because I understand it,
and I'm not gonna
be beating you up all the time.
We have a deal?
You got it.
Awesome.
Appreciate it, aviv.
Thank you.
Yeah, Pleasure.
Congratulations.
Thanks a lot.
(Barbara) Well,
what happened to you?
I guess I got cut out.
The undertaker
gets Buried.
That's okay.
You got ran over
by a bus.
The undertaker
got buried.
I still have my cash.
She was great,
by the way.
She was.
You know what
the best part is?
He's smart, and I
don't have to babysit.
I think it's a good deal.
I am so stoked!
Oh, my god!
This is exactly
the deal that we wanted.
And I-I'm just giddy.
I'm so happy.
