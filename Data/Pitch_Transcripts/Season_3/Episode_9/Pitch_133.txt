My name is Stephan aarstol.
I'm 39 years old, and I live
in San Diego, california.
I've always been
what you might call a-a geek,
you know, I got good grades,
I was on math team.
I've kind of always played
things by the book.
Coming out of graduate school
with an M.B.A.,
uh, you're sort of groomed to go
in a--a certain direction
Towards really corporate jobs,
management consulting type jobs,
and I-I did it,
but that, uh, just really sucked
the life out of me.
With the set of skills
that I have,
I wanted to do something
different,
you know, I guess I just
didn't know how different.
My name is Stephan aarstol.
My company is
tower paddle boards.
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 10% of my company.
What if I told you
the fastest-growing water sport
in the world
was something that each of you
could master
in about 20 minutes?
It's called
stand-up paddle Boarding.
Stand-up paddle Boarding is
absolutely exploding.
It's coming to every beach,
every river,
and every lake in the world.
It's got the cool,
soulful appeal of surfing,
and it's so easy to do
that all of you can do it.
(sighs)
my, uh...
(bleep).
my company is, uh...
don't worry. It's only your
biggest moment in your life.
It's so easy.
Uh, you--you can do it
with your friends.
You can do it with your child.
You can even do it
with your dog.
It's, uh...
can you tell us more about it?
Sure. Yeah. Um,
stand-up paddle boarding is
the fastest-growing water sport
in the world.
We know that.
What is--what is your product?
Um, we--we developed a brand
of stand-up paddle boards.
The tower brand, uh, exudes sort
of an active, social beach vibe.
You know, we produce and sell
boards, paddles,
and accessories,
and we sell them direct to
consumers through our web site.
How much have you sold?
We've sold $100,000.
Over what period of time?
Uh, in about four months.
What does the board sell for
and what does the paddle
sell for?
Okay, our boards sell
for, uh, $600.
Basically in this industry
right now, um,
paddle boards cost $1,200
to $1,600.
They're t--sold through
a traditional retail Channel.
Has everybody heard
of this sport before today?
Sure.
Oh, yeah.
I-I do it all the time.
Okay, so--
the paddle board Business
is--is going boom.
Some people on the panel
May not understand
all the cardio benefits of this.
Would you mind
if your lovely assistant
demonstrates exactly
how this works?
Where do you stand? How does
the paddle work?
If you don't mind.
You--you paddle like this.
And there's a health benefit
to this.
I noticed.
They say that one hour
of stand-up paddle Boarding
is equivalent--
in terms of exercise--
to eight hours of Surfing.
Convince me why your business is
gonna be participating
in this market
and why it's worth $1.5 million
today.
Sure. It's--it's on, uh,
and those sales are over
the past four months.
4 months ago, we did $3,000
in sales for that month.
Last month we did $35,000.
We're basically selling
a $1,200 board in a $600 dress.
So is the advantage I have
as an investor
I can get on the ground floor
of a low-cost provider
to the paddle board industry?
It--it is the low-cost provider
in a sense.
It's not the cheapest board
on the market.
(Robert) Right. There's cheaper
boards than 600 bucks.
There's cheap--well,
there's boards that are
about in that price range.
They're sold through
the TRADITIONAL retail channels.
So we're skipping all of that.
Now the direct Sales are
coming from your web site?
Coming from the--the web site.
And how are you
building traffic?
This is basically
the--the expertise
that we bring to the table.
I mean, sort of the pixie dust
that we have is
I'm an internet
marketing expert.
So what does it cost you
to acquire a customer that buys
a board? Do you have any idea?
Uh, yeah.
It doesn't cost us Anything.
Uh, we just started
this business.
I've--I've developed it myself.
I've developed the web site.
Um, like I was saying,
I'm an internet marketing expert
with about 12 years
of Experience.
Well, then you know
that answer's crap.
You know it costs you something
to get--get a customer
to come to your site.
Uh, you--you would be shocked.
You--you would be shocked.
Well, I'm going to be
if you tell me it's zero
because I don't believe you.
If you google "Best,
you know, paddle boards,"
We're not number one in google.
We're three of the top four.
Let's talk about money
for a second.
Sure.
You're telling me for $150,000,
I get 10%.
That means the value
of the company that you want me
to buy into is $1.5 million.
Sure.
I have $1.5 million, okay?
Okay.
Now why don't I take
some of my $1.5 million,
if I want to be
in this business,
and go to your manufacturer
and create Mr. Wonderful boards?
Then I set up a Web site,
I get a couple of geeks,
and they write the code for me
and I also have a web site.
How are you gonna sell it?
Are you gonna go through--
I'm gonna do
the same thing you do.
Direct.
I'm gonna pay nothing
for marketing
because you're telling me
I don't have to.
Okay.
What do I need you for is
my question.
Well, um, to--to basically--
to do that,
to do the zero marketing thing,
you're gonna need
to--to hire somebody
to get to the top of google.
And guys like me--
we're not cheap.
Yeah, but I can hire those guys
all day long.
You really think that none of us
up here have guys like--
I have plenty of guys
like this.
I do, too.
There's nothing that I can't
do myself. I don't need you.
Six months--
time-out. Time-out.
I can't hear another word.
Okay.
You're probably the worst
presenter I've ever met.
Oh, come on.
Just 'cause you don't get it
doesn't mean
he's a bad presenter.
Yes. No, I get it all.
Come on.
I've built so many web sites,
I've hired guys like this,
and you know what?
You talk like all of 'em.
You know they're like?
Leprechauns.
They come in the night.
They talk ibber-gibberish.
You don't get
what they're saying.
They run away with your wallet.
That's what happens, right.
Believe me. I've hired
so many guys like you.
That's ridiculous.
Barbara, that's ridiculous.
Well,
it's--it's not ridiculous.
I've had very bad experience
With guys that talk like this.
I don't get it.
I-I definitely failed to get
my--my message across to you.
Whoa, whoa, Whoa. Yeah, you have
failed to get your message
across, and I'm listening
with Both ears wide open.
I really am, okay?
Okay. I appreciate that,
Barbara.
You know what
I think you should do?
I think that you should stick
with being a nerd.
I'm out.
Don't listen to a word
she said.
Listen, I get your presentation,
but when I'm an investor
in something,
I want there to be something
proprietary about it
that at least I have a chance
when a competitor comes up,
that I can pour some boiling oil
on them...
Yeah.
But I can't do that here because
anybody can do what you do.
I gotta tell you,
I love the sport. I really do,
because it makes old guys
like me think we're cool.
But your valuation is not cool--
not $1.5 million today.
I'm out.
Basically, the bicycle for water
was invented
about the same time that
the--the biggest social network
in the world was invented.
And in that time, they've--
they've amassed, you know,
500 million Users. Correct?
The number of bicycles
in the world is 1 billion--
twice the amount
of the number of cars.
This is basically
a bicycle for the water.
Oh, my god. I have a headache.
Okay, I don't think
you understand
what we can't get over.
We can't get over
you've been
in this business three months,
there's nothing proprietary
about it,
you are valuing the business
at $1.5 million.
The problem is when
a magician starts to believe
his own tricks,
that becomes the problem,
and with that said, I'm out.
Okay. Thanks
for the consideration.
Um, so you're still in it,
mark.
I think--I think you
totally understand
sort of
the specialized expertise
that goes into a business
like this.
Is anybody else still in?
I'm still in. I'm still in.
I'm trying to--I'm trying to--
you know what I'm trying to do?
Because your--your presentation
is so different...
yeah, I know.
I'm not saying it's bad
or Good.
I'm just saying it's different.
I'm trying to structure the deal
that makes sense for me,
because I'm interested in you.
You're interesting, okay?
Okay.
So I'm thinking to myself,
why don't I give you $150,000
for 50% of this entity,
and I'd like to sell
other stuff.
And I'd want to get my cash back
though,
so I want a 10% cash royalty
on everything you sell.
So I'm getting a check
every month,
right off the top.
And if you need more money,
I'll give you more money.
But I want to be
a 50/50 partner.
Sure.
How deep does that well go?
Well, I don't know. You have
to dream up the products.
You call me up, say, "Hey,
daddy, I got a new idea."
I say "I don't care."
I want to be your Banker.
(Robert) That's exactly
what you're doing.
(Kevin) I just want
to give you some cash.
I-I think it's interesting,
but I've--I've--honestly,
you guys, this business is
an $11 million business
in a few years.
(speaks indistinctly)
Ah, look,
this is today's business.
Don't you have any other ideas?
This is an opportunity cost
for me. You're saying--
don't <i>you</i> have any other ideas
on what to sell?
I do. I have three
other business plans
that are
$50 million business plans.
Welcome home, son.
(laughs)
I have plenty of money.
That's not a problem.
I-I respect that offer,
but I told you earlier
in the presentation,
you can't hire guys like me.
We work for ourselves.
Sure, I can.
I'm doing it right now.
We--we can--we can call
our own shots. I mean--
I want to buy 50%
of your company for $150,000.
You want to buy 50% of me
is what you're saying.
Well, what's the difference?
What are you guys talking about?
What are you--
I don't know.
He's plain impossible.
What are you guys doing?
Give the guy an ANSWER--
YES or no?
to mess around, Stephan.
So you just gotta make your--
make a de-decision.
I'm not gonna sit here and get
into a back and forth with
not-so-Mr. Wonderful, right?
(laughs)
I-I like your attitude,
and I think--I think you--
I think you get it,
and I'm--$150,000 is way less
than I should take
for 30% of this company,
and I--
you're gonna realize that
in about two years.
What could be a better figure?
But I'm gonna make my money
on the back end.
I like your deal, mark.
I like your deal.
Right. Right. Let's do it.
Let's do it.
(Robert) so?
Whoo! Whoa.
Did not see that coming.
I did not
see that coming.
I appreciate it.
This was--this was
a lot of fun with you guys.
Thank you.
It's a pleasure.
(laughs)
Oh, my gosh.
That was a r--that was
a rough start, right?
Did you see that coming?
I didn't see that coming.
That's a generous offer.
But you know what?
You didn't see it coming because
That's the way I played it.
You know, you bought his brain.
I'm a business builder.
I take small things
and make them great things.
