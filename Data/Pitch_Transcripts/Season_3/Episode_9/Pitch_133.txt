Hi. My name is aviv grill.
I am the C.E.O. Of miso media,
Aviv, so very smart
to bring Ingrid here
to help sell your product.
Thank you.
She's also an advisor
to the company.
What are the sales
today, aviv?
So in the past month,
we've had 80,000 downloads.
So when you say "Download,"
what are we downloading?
So the app--
the ipad app.
So this is why
it doesn't make sense here.
You have incredible artists.
aviv, I'm not gonna
match that offer.
I'm out.
Aviv, what is the thing
that's gonna accelerate you
to where it's
a very big enterprise?
Well, music education is
a $9 billion a year industry.
Right.
That's a--
that's a huge market.
Do you see being able to charge
for a premium version
Appreciate it, aviv.
Thank you.
Yeah, Pleasure.
Congratulations.
Thanks a lot.
(Barbara) Well,
what happened to you?
I guess I got cut out.
The undertaker
gets Buried.
That's okay.
You got ran over
by a bus.
The undertaker
got buried.

by the way.
