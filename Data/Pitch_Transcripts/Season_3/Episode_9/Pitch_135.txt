We're Nick and penilopee Larosa
from tampa, Florida.
Our product
is the instant lifts.
We're seeking $100,000
for 25% of our business.
We have solved
the problem of cellulite
and sagging skin for women.
The instant lift
are clear dermahesives
that go on the skin,
and it lifts
and repositions the skin,
and it makes everything
look firm and tight.
They go on five
different body parts.
They hide discreetly
under clothes.
Here's a typical
flabby arm.
You take the product...
apply it like this...
here's my before,
(Robert laughs)
Here's my after.
See?
Here's my before,
there's my After.
Here's a pair of thighs
all dimply with Cellulite.
Before
our instant lifts...
after Our instant lifts.
Isn't that great?
And then watch this thigh
lift right up.
Isn't that amazing?
And it goes underneath shorts,
and makes you look like you got
a nice, tight leg again.
(laughter and groans)
Barbara's been doing this
with Masking tape forever.
(laughter)
Well, ours is
a little special.
This is not just
a piece of tape.
We've got
the formula developed,
we have a design
developed.
But--but doesn't--after you wear
it for a couple of hours,
it starts to loosen up
and starts looking like
chewed bubble gum
in a plastic bag?
No. Absolutely not.
We live in
Hot, sweaty tampa.
If it can last through
one of my tampa hot flashes,
it can last all day.
And how long does it last?
If you tape yourself up
on a new day...
12 to 15 hours a day.
How long?
It--you get one use
out of it,
but it will last
12 to 15 hours.
Are you guys selling any
right now?
Yes. We have been selling these
for about five months.
We've done about 75,000
between us and the website
We're just getting started.
75,000 units
or $75,000?
Dollars.
And how much is each unit?
5 pair for $19.95.
Why is it you haven't
made it for the Chin?
Uh, we're--we're here to talk
about this one today.
(Robert) no?
We have other products.
Yeah.
But it would all be
part of the same company?
(Nick and penilopee) No.
Oh.
They're
different patents.
Different things.
But you're selling me
everything?
I'm selling you this.
(mark) No.
(daymond) Nope.
(Kevin) Well, good to know.
Five body parts--
basically, from here down
we can cover it.
So you're selling me
below the face?
(laughter)
Yeah.
But above the face...
that's a different meeting.
How are you gonna
manage your time, then?
I mean, if I give you
all this money,
I don't want you
working on anything
but what makes me money.
So how are you gonna work
on two different products,
or potentially,
even more?
We can get it handled.
Piece of Cake.
No, there's no such thing
as "Getting it handled,
piece of cake."
No, they're two entirely
different categories,
so it wouldn't be--
there wouldn't be a conflict.
But it's the same product.
Agree with me--it's the same
product. It's the same idea.
I don't agree with you.
It's the same area
of bus--
from a consumer perspective,
it's the same product.
Technically,
it might be different,
but if I'm thinking,
you know what?
My Butt--Butt and my arms
need a lift,
and, boy, these guys do
a great job.
I want a Chin lift or
whatever else it might be,
an eye lift, I'm gonna come
to the same company,
because of the money spent
on branding this product.
We might be able to work
something out like that.
Then we could sell them
the smooth sleepers
and things like that.
We can talk about that, sure.
We--we have--
well, hurry up
and start talking.
We have multiple...
we have multiple
products on the market.
Well, we have
a lot here to sell.
Yeah?
We do.
We have a lot here
to start off with.
Okay, well, I'm gonna
start off with this--I'm out.
We--we discovered that you've
got another product
in the same category.
Everybody up here
feels uncomfortable with that,
because, as Mr. Cuban
pointed out,
you're not working
100% for me anymore
if I'm an investor.
There's something
in the back of your mind
that's using up your time
for somebody else,
and I can't live with That.
So, you know, you gotta
get to a place...
okay. Let's put
the smooth sleepers in.
Where you're throwing that
on the table.
Let's put
the smooth sleepers in.
No, the smooth sleepers are not
what they're talking about.
They're talking
about the face Lifts.
That's not ours.
It's not ours, yes.
But wait! There's more!
(Robert) What's the other
product we don't know about?
This is being Very secretive--
Well, the first product
she invented...
almost like this product,
you know? When you...
there's no secret
about it.
But we have a life outside of
these lifts, it's True.
I have five inventions,
several patents...
right there, guys.
Guys...
you just proved
Mr. Cuban's point.
The fact is, you just--
you just made my point. Yeah.
But...
yeah, but you have all
these other products.
But we would shelve that
for this.
You just said, "I have
another part of my life."
We do.
Would you give anybody money
Who would then,
when you call them back
about the money, they go,
"Oh, I was doing the other
stuff. I got another life, too."
Would you really do that?
No, we are actually not
that kind of people.
We're very focused.
But you just said that.
No, I'm telling you
we have other products.
But if you and I
partnered together,
this would become
our priority.
This pitch is really like
that woman I meet
and I take home,
and she rips that tape off,
and her bingo wings just
hang out all over the place.
(Robert) Why is it called
a "Bingo wing"?
'cause when a-a grandma
is playing bingo,
and she goes, "Bingo!"
and her wing goes...
(laughter)
I didn't think
you were so worried
about some other product.
Here's the crazy thing--
I was actually very interested.
I think there's
a big market for this.
But you're creating
a new market.
You're creating a brand
and you're creating
a category.
And the category is--use tape
to Make yourself look thinner.
Right.
I just don't understand how
you can break up body parts.
Let's sell Barbara
the shoulders.
Let's sell daymond the legs.
Let's sell Kevin the boobs.
Well, you have everything here
except the Face.
Right.
(laughs)
And that is
a different part.
(mark) But not from
our perspective.
Guys, there's too much confusion
for me. Like I said...
no, no...
from a strategic
perspective,
you made some choices--
maybe not the right ones--
so I'm out.
You're not making any money now
if you normalized your salaries.
You're not worth $400,000.
I'm out.
Okay.
I don't think this strategy
sticks together for me.
It's very confusing.
I'm out.
Guys, you have
one last chance
to pitch your
bingo wings--Barbara.
There's a lot of women out there
that won't even wear shorts.
I believe you.
Here's what I think.
What are you doing, Barbara?
I'm a woman, certainly,
and I could envision a lot
of women using this product.
But the money
is just too much
for the very little bit
of sales you have.
I'm out.
I think we're all out.
It's done.
(Barbara) it is pricy,
I have to say.
I don't get it. I think
it's a big disappointment
when you finally untape
your woman
and you see
what you actually got.
(laughs)
(high-pitched voice)
"Bingo!"
I wish we could get in there
and do it again
and just not bring up
the face tape
and--and just focus on
the--the arm lifts
and the body Lifts.
