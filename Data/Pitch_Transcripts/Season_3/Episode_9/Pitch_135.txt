Hi. My name is Gary dejohn
Um, Gary...
yes, sir.
There are many aerators
on the market.
There are.
I own them all.
Gary, can I see it?
Sure.
Thank you.
Mark.
It's clever.
Thank you, Gary.
You're welcome.
So are you seeing this
for probably more high-end
restaurants that have a cellar?
Gary, do you have
any sales today?
Um, not much. I've sold
about 1,000 of them.
Gary, what gave you the idea?
Um, it's actually a statistic
that in restaurants,
if you finish your first glass
of wine before your entree,
the chances of you ordering
a second glass of wine
are 78% higher.
So now you've
increased your sales
at every Single table
That's drinking Wine.
Gary, I don't know anything
about this market,
so I can't help you in this.
I'm out.
Hey, Gary, I hate
to join the chorus,
but, you know, I have a rule--
I don't trust any bottle of wine
that costs more than $5.
Gary, I think there is
a market for the product,
but it's just not something
that I want to invest in.
I'm out.
Only the wino's left.
Only the wino's left.
So, Gary, you know,
I take the product Works.
Thank you.
It's not unique.
Gary, I have to pick
my battles,
Go get 'em, Gary.
Good luck.
(Robert) Love that guy.
Good guy.
Small niche product.
