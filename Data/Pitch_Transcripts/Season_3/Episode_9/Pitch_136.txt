Hi. My name is Gary dejohn
and I'll be your server
tonight,
and I am so tired
of saying that.
I have developed a product that
is going to revolutionize
the way
we serve wine worldwide.
I'm asking for
a $75,000 investment
for 30% equity in my company,
vinamor.
Wine is a living organism.
When it is bottled,
the winemaker
basically puts it to sleep,
and it needs to be
woken up before tasting.
People are continually let down
by the Harsh tannins and acidity
associated with red wine,
so they've turned to this--
a traditional wine decanter.
Take the entire contents
of a bottle,
pour it in the top...
it's messy.
Now here's the hard part.
You wait about an hour.
My product does this
in just seconds.
This is how it works--
the vinamor sits neatly
in the top of any wine glass.
As you pour the wine through the
strainer and over the ball,
it exposes
all the wine to air,
gives it the most amount
of surface area possible,
and allows the wine
to breathe.
Every glass of wine poured
at home or in restaurants
needs to be poured
through a vinamor
to give it
the proper taste.
With a $75,000 investment,
I will be able to manufacture
on a much grander scale
than I currently can,
and it will also kick-start
my marketing campaign
to get these into every house,
every restaurant,
and every Liquor store
nationwide.
Now Kevin would like
to come up here
and test taste
a couple of these for me.
I'm gonna pour one
in a regular wine glass
and one with the vinamor.
All right.
This one's been aerated?
Absolutely.
Yeah, it works.
(laughs)
I'll just keep this.
Sure.
(laughter)
Um, Gary...
yes, sir.
There are many aerators
on the market.
There are.
I own them all.
And, uh, this is
a novel design, obviously,
but it's not unique.
It's also a little more delicate
'cause it's glass, is it not?
It is a little bit
more delicate,
however, we can make it out of
a really nice acrylic
and make it
a little bit more durable.
But tell me
what the difference
between the aerators
I already have and this--
they both aerate wine
very successfully.
They do. However,
the other ones
can't measure
a glass of wine.
So when you're looking at
a restaurant scenario...
so you're saying
you tell the staff
to pour to
the middle of the ball?
Right. Absolutely.
It cuts your
overpouring costs,
and, I mean,
it's dual-Purpose.
Cuts your overpouring costs,
gets every ounce of profit
out of every bottle
at every Restaurant.
Gary, can I see it?
Sure.
Thank you.
Mark.
It's clever.
Thank you, Gary.
You're welcome.
So are you seeing this
for probably more high-end
restaurants that have a cellar?
Not necessarily,
but you can brand this.
When you look at a store
like the Olive garden,
you could basically put
the Olive garden logo
inside the ball
and then sell them
as a retail item.
Gary, do you have
any sales today?
Um, not much. I've sold
about 1,000 of them.
And to whom?
Uh, direct to consumer.
I actually--I work
in a restaurant.
Uh, that's where
the idea came from.
And pretty much every one
of my tables that drinks wine
takes one home.
And what do they sell for?
$40.
And what's your cost?
$20.
That's way too high
for this.
Absolutely.
It is way too high.
And that's why
I need an investment,
to take this overseas and make
as much profit as possible.
How much I know
about wine, or care...
Mm-Hmm.
Wouldn't even fit into
one of those glasses. I'm out.
What's your plan
for distribution for this?
Basically, if I can get them
into every restaurant
that serves wine,
then we've got free salespeople
in the restaurant.
Restaurants don't sell
wine Apparel.
Yet.
It's complicated--
the Design.
Who designed that?
I did.
Gary, what gave you the idea?
Um, it's actually a statistic
that in restaurants,
if you finish your first glass
of wine before your entree,
the chances of you ordering
a second glass of wine
are 78% higher.
So now you've
increased your sales
at every Single table
That's drinking Wine.
Gary, I don't know anything
about this market,
so I can't help you in this.
I'm out.
Hey, Gary, I hate
to join the chorus,
but, you know, I have a rule--
I don't trust any bottle of wine
that costs more than $5.
And so...
try that. Try that.
Put a $5 bottle of wine
through there,
and it'll make it taste like
a $50 bottle of wine.
I'm a beer drinker,
not a wine drinker at all.
So, I-I really couldn't help.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Gary, I think there is
a market for the product,
but it's just not something
that I want to invest in.
I'm out.
Only the wino's left.
Only the wino's left.
So, Gary, you know,
I take the product Works.
Thank you.
It's not unique.
And the only way
to make this work
is for you to license this.
It's not a project I want
to take on, my friend.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Are you sure?
I am sure.
I am sure. The only thing
you've differentiated--
'cause I know every aerator
on the market--
is this measurement concept
for the restaurant industry,
which is a small subset
of the total aeration market.
The thing is, I like
to go make money
so I can buy
$2,000 bottles of wine.
Right.
And I drink the whole thing
with a straw.
I'll do it for 45%.
Gary, I have to pick
my battles,
and, um, use my time wisely.
I'm sorry, my friend.
Anybody else want back in?
(laughs)
(mark) smart man.
Barbara?
No, thank you.
No?
Mark, I'm gonna go put on
my nowitzki jersey.
I wish I could.
(laughs)
I give you a little money,
you give me a little money.
You know, I got
fubu boxers on.
If I knew this business,
you'd be a great partner,
and that would be
a great product.
I-I just can't help you.
Okay. Well,
thank you for your time.
Go get 'em, Gary.
Good luck.
(Robert) Love that guy.
Good guy.
Small niche product.
The guy had
the hustle and the heart.
It doesn't make me feel happy
that they weren't interested,
but they're not
the only investors out there.
And when I sell
for $40 million next year,
then I can come back
and laugh at them.
