My name Jay Kriner,
and I am an unexploded ordnance
technician.
I dispose of bombs.
There are millions
of unexploded devices
all around the world...
(beeps)
From a tiny bullet
to a major missile
that was rocket propelled.
There's very little room
for error.
If something did happen,
there could be a "ba-boom,"
and there's no more Jay.
Bombs pay the bills right now,
But family comes first.
My wife Jenna and I
are having our first kid,
so it's extremely important
that I stay out of harm's way.
With my product, I know that
I can create a safer future
for me and my family.
I've put tons of years
of thought into this.
Now it's time to take it
to the next level.
And with the sharks' help,
I know this business will...
ba-bam!
Hello. My name is Jay Kriner,
and my product and business
is the Bev Buckle.
I am seeking $50,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my business.
The Bev Buckle is one of
the most interesting Inventions
America has ever seen.
Picture this--You're at
a sporting event,
a concert,
fishing at the river,
and you feel the need
to free up your hands
of your beverage...
Ba-bam!
(Robert) Oh, my god.
(sharks laugh)
Oh-Ho-Ho, man!
Oh, that is a great idea.
It's the only buckle
on the market
that can fold out
to hold your beverage.
Did Christmas come early?
Yes, it did.
(laughter)
Everyone knows someone
Who would want one.
I can design the faceplate
to have any brand,
any logo, and any color.
Licensing, branding.
So keep
that cold beverage close,
and those hands free,
because it's the Bev Buckle.
Ba-Bam!
Ba-Bam!
Ba-Bam, baby!
How did you come up
with this idea?
I was in college,
and I'm out
with my friends a lot,
and we went to bars,
having some good times,
and I-I just--out of habit,
I kept doing this.
And I thought to myself,
man, if I could just
hold my beer hands-free,
I could, uh, maybe show off
my poor dance moves, or...
(laughs)
Can I see one of
those buckles? Do you mind?
Absolutely.
Doesn't come with the belt?
Thank you, sir.
It's heavy. Whoo.
Is it a magnet
that's holding it closed?
It is.
Do you have any sales now?
I have actually
gone across America
and personally sold,
at festivals and other events,
over 4,000 units.
Over what period of time?
Over four years.
What does that translate to
in sales?
We're at $340,000.
Do you have a patent?
Yes.
What's your cost
to make these?
It's, uh, $10.
And I sell it for $35,
up to $110,
depending on
what's on the face.
Let's ask Mr. China here.
It's a good price?
Pretty good price, Yeah.
What's your
full-time job, Jay?
I just got out of school
to be an unexploded ordnance
technician.
What does that mean?
Identification
and remediation
on unexploded
military ordnance.
So it's like "The Hurt Locker"?
you're looking
for guys with bombs?
Absolutely.
Do you want to do that?
That is my plan "B."
I need something that I can
provide for my family.
I got my first kid
on the way,
so I have to have something
to fall back on.
The only problem
with your job,
if you make
a mistake one day,
you'll be in five pieces.
This is true.
There are no mistakes.
So, Jay,
what's the game plan?
You get the $50,000.
Yeah?
What happens tomorrow?
I'll actually let you choose
Between option number 1
and option number 2.
(sharks laugh)
I love this guy!
Which one of you
want to see
which is in what?
Number 1!
I have a list for you
of some people
that want it
in every store they own.
So here you've got
Urban Outfitters,
Cowboy Harley Davidson,
Boston Beer Company,
Seaside Marketing.
And number 2 is a list
of every major raceway
that wants the buckle
sold trackside.
Daytona, Talladega,
Darlington, Michigan,
Watkins Glen,
Nascar and other
pro events.
Any of those people
written you a check?
No, because
I have an issue.
I came into a problem
with my manufacturer.
My recent Order
was 26% defective.
Whoa.
Yes.
Bad news, Jay.
Can I see that, please?
Why wouldn't you have taken
a purchase order
from anybody on this list?
I don't have working capital
to supply that.
If I got a check in advance,
I could seal the deal.
Are you gonna work
full-time on this?
If I'm able to, absolutely.
What does that mean?
You need a salary?
Something's gotta
pay the bills.
And the bombs,
I'd rather not do.
How much money would you need
to make it a full-time job?
Past mortgage and bills...
Let's say it's, uh,
$2,000, $3,000.
A month?
A month.
Okay.
So this is what
the list is worth...
when I started,
<i>everybody </i>said they wanted it,
but nobody wrote a check.
You're asking to value a company
at half a million dollars,
and then also to teach you.
I won't have the time
to help you. I'm out.
Jay, how much do you have
in inventory right now?
62 units.
Jay, look, the math
is not adding up for me.
You've had these same
exact challenges for four years,
and nothing has changed.
I'm not saying
you're not working hard.
Maybe it's just that
you're not working smart.
I'm out.
Mark is right.
You're running faster every day
and you're standing still.
You're not getting anywhere.
I don't have
a problem with that.
That was me.
I didn't know what to do.
I learned from others.
It's gonna suck up
<i>a lot </i>of my time,
but here's what I'll do--
I'll give you the $50,000
for 75%.
You just need some guidance,
my friend.
I think you're on
the right track.
Okay, the offer
Robert is making you
is the kind of offer
they made in medieval times,
when robber barons
roamed the land
and stole people's
companies from them.
75% gone.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
I'm gonna give you
the $50,000,
and I don't want
any equity in it, okay?
I'd like to get
a royalty on the top
of every one sold.
I want 12%, and I'll give you
your $50,000.
Frankly, I'd rather do this
than see you
blown up with mines.
I would rather
be doing that, too.
How much do you want this?
Really bad.
This buckle can continue
to leech along
and--And snail
its way through,
or it can just boom.
Let's go
to sporting goods stores,
and say it's another accessory
while you fish.
It has other avenues,
so let's open those up.
You know, Jay, I'm jumping in,
and I'll do it for 51%
to knock him
out of the box,
'cause he's overeating
and he's greedy.
Last thing I am is greedy.
But you cannot take a salary
from that $50,000,
simply 'cause the math
doesn't work.
Well, what's he gonna live on?
I think that's insane,
that you would give up 75%.
I do, too.
It's crazy.
What for?
That's just crazy.
I wouldn't even listen
to that noise.
What, you're saying
your offer is better, O'Leary?
The problem with
that offer is,
when you're growing a business,
the last thing you want to do
is send 12% of the cash flow
out the business.
You're here
because you need cash.
Jay, I want you
to take a coffee cup
and put it right there
on your belt buckle,
'cause coffee is
for closers.
I want you to close on
one of those guys right now.
Make a decision.
What are you gonna do?
Life is full of choices.
You gotta pick one,
my friend.
I think the best person
to come into business with...
to be honest with you,
I think Barbara.
You're a smart guy.
You made a mistake,
my friend.
Good decision.
Thank you very much.
Best decision.
Thank you.
You made a mistake.
You gave up control
of your company.
Thank you, all.
(singsongy) He's gonna be rich.
Thank you, Jay.
Ba-Bam!
