My name Jay Kriner,
Hello. My name is Jay Kriner,
What's your
full-time job, Jay?
I just got out of school
to be an unexploded ordnance
technician.
What does that mean?
So, Jay,
what's the game plan?
You get the $50,000.
Yeah?
What happens tomorrow?
I'll actually let you choose
Between option number 1
Yes.
Bad news, Jay.
Can I see that, please?
Why wouldn't you have taken
a purchase order
from anybody on this list?
I don't have working capital
to supply that.
If I got a check in advance,
I could seal the deal.
Are you gonna work
full-time on this?
If I'm able to, absolutely.
What does that mean?
You need a salary?
Something's gotta
pay the bills.
Jay, how much do you have
in inventory right now?
62 units.
Jay, look, the math
is not adding up for me.
You've had these same
exact challenges for four years,
You know, Jay, I'm jumping in,
Jay, I want you
to take a coffee cup
(singsongy) He's gonna be rich.
Thank you, Jay.
Ba-Bam!
