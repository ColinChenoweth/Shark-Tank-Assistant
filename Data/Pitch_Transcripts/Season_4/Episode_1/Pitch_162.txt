My name's Derek Pacque.
I'm 23 years old,
but Derek is
a capable individual
that can really take
this business to great heights.
(Derek) Professor Hays
knows what it takes
to really get something
off the ground.
It's gonna cost
half a million dollars.
We don't want to raise
equity capital on that.
That's huge.
It's like giving...
Hi, sharks.
I'm Derek Pacque,
Derek, what is the business?
Is the business the service
or are you trying
to sell the technology?
We're franchising.
Okay. So, Derek,
what is the plan
to sell $100,000
of these units?
We're starting to get agreements
with area developers right now.
For example, in Chicago,
someone says to me, "Hey--
I need 50 franchises opened.
"I'm willing
to put down $150,000
"to start off in equipment
to get this out there
in Chicago."
So wait, wait,
let me get this straight--
You have not sold
any of these yet?
Nope. We just--
So you haven't had
a chance to test it, right?
Derek, why don't you go
to the busiest steakhouse
near where you live,
And for that reason, Derek,
I'm out.
It struck me like it takes
entirely too long
to check in a coat.
What we're gonna do is,
essentially,
it's gonna be an iphone app,
you just come up,
scan your Q.R. Code.
So, Derek, let's take stock
of where we're at right now.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
You've got three
sharks out.
Mm-hmm.
On either end are two
that are still in.
Mm-hmm.
I'd ignore
the guys in the middle.
Start working on trying to get
some money out of these people.
Okay. Well, I'd like
to say one thing--
I'm just out of college.
This is why I'm here.
I'm trying to figure out
the best ways to scale this.
One of my partners
is my professor
You know--
Derek, I like the idea.
So, Derek, I-I love this.
I just...
make me another offer
Under $2 million.
I can't get
to the $2 million.
Um...
uh...
I asked for $200,000
because it's-It's a start.
It's gonna get me
to commercialization.
He--He asked you
a very, very simple question.
Slow down and think about it
one more time.
Derek, everybody checked out
on your valuation.
$2 million, $1.5 million.
You basically have
an experiment--
No disrespect to you.
