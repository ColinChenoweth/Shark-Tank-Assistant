Hi. My name is
Veronica Perlongo,
and this is my partner
of 15 years Maria Curcio.
Our product is BuggyBeds,
and we are seeking
a $125,000 investment
for 7% equity
in our company.
These simple little
fabric hitchhikers
have been causing panic
and chaos across the world.
Bedbug infestations Have
increased over 500%
in the last few years alone,
causing a global epidemic.
Stop the madness!
A simple twin bed like this
can have thousands to hundreds
of thousands of bedbugs
feeding on you,
causing you red, swollen,
itchy lumps.
And one female
can lay up to 500 eggs.
Wow.
You could have bedbugs in
your home and not even know it.
And that's why we created...
BuggyBeds!
BuggyBeds!
(chuckles)
BuggyBeds is a bedbug glue trap
that is
an early detection system.
It's designed to attract,
trap bedbugs dead.
Simply slide and hide buggybed
between your box spring mattress
or under your couch cushions.
And BuggyBeds provide
peace of mind for everyone.
(both) Sleep tight
and don't let the bedbugs bite.
(Barbara and Robert laugh)
Well, let's see
who's gonna bite.
Can we have a look
at the product?
Absolutely.
Sure.
Veronica's gonna hand you out
our travel pack.
You take it with you
to hotel rooms.
(Mark) How long have you guys
been doing this?
We launched the product
about six months ago.
Why we're here is,
we have weaknesses
for big box distribution
and the retail stores.
Oh, so you want help in getting
retail distribution?
Correct.
Correct.
Does this eradicate
all of the bedbugs?
This has been designed,
actually,
as an early detection system.
Is your vision that I would
go to a hotel
with one of these...
correct.
Put it under my bed, and say,
"Whoa!"
Correct.
"I gotta change rooms.
There's bugs in here"?
we've actually
even had that happen.
Whoa.
Everyone keeps asking
the same question--
"Why are we so infested?"
Because there is no really good
early detection system.
Early detection.
Is it tested and proven
or is this your claim?
Yes, it's--We've tested it.
We worked with a couple
entomologists, dermatologists,
as well as myself.
Came up with a formula.
We just had a housing authority,
for instance.
We sent them a case
of 144 traps,
at their request for a sample,
three months ago.
They just placed an order
last week for 22,000 traps
because of
the successful results.
(Robert) Wow. It's not toxic
in any way? I mean...
No, it's nontoxic
and pesticide-Free.
BuggyBeds is patented
as a design in 34 countries.
The trademark of the name
BuggyBeds and the logo itself
is in 42 countries.
The utility is pending
in 50 countries.
(Kevin) Who is actually doing
the manufacturing for you?
We're actually taking it
in-house now 100%.
It's very cost effective
and easy.
What is the suggested
retail price of each of those?
The 2-packs are, uh,
$6.99 to $8.99.
And what is your cost
of making it?
$1.35.
What are your sales right now?
Uh, currently,
our sales are $150,000.
We started with
Home Depot's web site,
and they just picked us up
for 60 of their stores
that we just shipped out
this week.
Whoa! You never said that
before.
With this product?
Correct.
We also just got
a purchase order from
75 Burlington Coat Factories
as well.
Can I say one other thing?
On the $150,000 in sales,
we have $100,000 in profit.
For six months
since you've introduced it?
Correct.
$150,000 for 6 months.
You're valuing the company--
You're asking for $125,000
for 7%, correct?
Correct.
You're saying the company's
valued around $1.75 million.
Why are you valuing the company
at that?
That's a great question.
Before we launched,
I was offered $5 million
for the trademarks
and the patent from a company.
(sharks) Whoa!
Wait a minute.
And you turned that down?
Yes.
What?!
Shame on you!
Are you... uh...
I'm Mrs. Wonderful of business.
I know what we have here.
I know the value.
We did a test market
in 29 stores of shoprite.
They contacted us.
The entire corporation sold out
in 10 days in 29 stores.
We just had a Walmart
local manager look at it.
The first thing said is,
"Wow! This is eye candy.
You can have it--have it
in front of the register."
I like her. (laughs)
Wow. You two bedbugs are
the real deal.
I-I think we know you guys are
the real deal.
I'm itching to do this deal.
(all laugh)
Okay. Ladies, ladies,
I want you to step outside
for me, okay?
Because I want us to have
a little shark discussion, okay?
Uh-Oh.
Okay, boys and girl,
we all want part of this deal.
So what do you want
to go up to?
I'd like to see
what they're offering.
I think they're very interested
and I think they're gonna--
Depends on what value they're
gonna bring to the table.
Yeah.
I mean, it depends--
You know, I'm not gonna give up
something what we have.
We have tremendous value.
Right.
I want to avoid a shark fight.
I want a piece of the deal.
I know everybody else
are thinking the same thing.
I want collusion.
She turned down $5 million.
Yeah, she turned down
$5 million.
Do you really wanna go in
about the dollars
or getting all five of us?
We have to give her something
of tremendous value.
All five of us for 25%?
Yeah, all five of us are
tremendous value.
Well, I'd rather have
a bigger chunk for myself,
to be honest with you.
I'm always, uh, wary
when Kevin does all the talking
and Mark doesn't say a word.
I'm just listening.
I'm just listening.
Are you in on this?
I have nothing to say.
you will be on the phone
forever.
(Maria and Veronica laugh)
you realize
they're both giving you
basically the same value
of the company.
Correct.
Ladies, do you accept the offer
or not?
Keep in mind, Maria, you've got
the offer from Daymond and Kevin
for $250,000 for 25%,
and Mark and I haven't made
any offer yet.
Okay, So, Barbara,
are you in or out?
My offer's off the table.
I'm out.
Too bad.
I love your business.
You guys have everything
under control, basically.
The issue really is,
can you run fast enough
to keep up with everything?
Mm-hmm.
You have no idea.
I think the best deal is
for the four of us--
and actually, if Barbara wants
to come back in--
the five of us on the--
You're being a gentleman.
No, I'll leave the boys club
up to the boys.
The only reason I would, uh,
make my offer
is to screw over Mark Cuban.
Ha!
But I think each of us can
add something, as Mark said.
I'm in on the deal with Mark,
Daymond, and Kevin.
$250,000 for 25%.
(Kevin) Come on, Barbara.
Barbara, you should come in.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I don't even like these guys,
But just to make
your life pleasant,
I'm gonna jump back in the deal.
Before she changes her mind,
you have all five sharks,
quarter of a million dollars
for 25% of the company.
Yes or no?
Okay, can we take on minute to--
No.
(Kevin and Barbara)
Don't even think about it.
I have one request.
Will you teach me
the Cha-Cha-Cha?
(laughs) It's a deal.
(laughs)
It's a deal.
Wow!
(Daymond) That is history.
(Kevin) Wow!
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations to you, guys.
You guys are gonna do great.
Now go back and sprinkle bedbugs
in every hotel
and restaurant you can.
(laughs)
Yes!
(laughs)
Yes!
We did it, baby!
All five of them. Whoo-Hoo!
Barbara, your greed almost
killed that deal for all of us.
Yeah, you're a savage.
Bedbugs--My best friends.
They're your relatives.
Well, it's a great business.
Having all five sharks get in
the deal together
was <i>amazing</i>
for it to ever happen.
That's tremendous for us.
