My name's Derek Pacque.
I'm 23 years old,
and I just graduated from
the Kelley School of Business
at Indiana University.
It has graduates such as
U.S. State senators,
C.E.O.S of fortune 500
companies,
and even mark cuban.
I got the idea for my business
when I was still at school.
Hey, guys, can you hand me
your jackets?
They're in the way.
I was hanging out
with some friends at a bar,
and it just came to me.
My college professor
liked my idea so much,
he actually decided
to become an investor.
This is the unit, right?
Not only is this business
a great idea,
but Derek is
a capable individual
that can really take
this business to great heights.
(Derek) Professor Hays
knows what it takes
to really get something
off the ground.
It's gonna cost
half a million dollars.
We don't want to raise
equity capital on that.
That's huge.
It's like giving...
Professor Hays and I make
a great team.
He brings a lot of experience,
and I bring a lot of energy.
(bells peal)
I have risked a lot
to turn this business
into a career.
I've put in all my savings,
I've taken money
from family and friends,
and turned down
many great job offers.
Getting a deal with the sharks
is exactly what I need
to turn my dream into a reality.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Derek Pacque,
and I'm a Hoo! Hoo! Hoo...
Hoosiers, baby.
Hoosier.
I'm the founder of CoatChex,
and I'm here today asking
for $200,000
for a 10% equity stake
in my company.
While attending
Indiana University,
I recognized a dilemma
that everyone faces
When they go out
in bad weather--
They either don't
wear a coat...
(Shivers) and Shiver,
or they could wear a soft,
warm, and cozy coat,
but then they have to
babysit it all night.
I wish I'd put
a leash on mine
because one night,
it was stolen
while throwing down my favorite
moves on the dance floor.
I was so mad
that I went up to a manager
and I asked them why
they didn't have a coat check.
They told me it was
way too much of a hassle.
So I asked them, "can I
open one up myself?"
before I knew it,
I had two coat checks
set up in my college town.
During this time,
I came to realize
why no one
provides coat checks.
This is the security.
It's just not organized
or effective.
May I present to you
our ticketless
coat check system?
With our innovative technology,
we match a person's face
to their belonging.
You simply hand over
your coat
and then type your name
into the system,
and a picture is taken
automatically.
All you do from there,
you just pay.
It's that easy.
There's no more dealing
with tickets.
She can now see a picture
of the person and their coat
to make sure she's giving it
back to the right person.
It is time
to turn an inconvenience
into an opportunity.
So how 'bout one of you
writes me a check?
And I'll check you
into coatchex.
Do you have any sales?
No, I've not made--
the technology,
we just started.
Derek, what is the business?
Is the business the service
or are you trying
to sell the technology?
We're franchising.
We have a system now
and we have equipment
so that anyone can sort of
do what I did.
So you want to sell
the computer, the design...
Yes.
Everything.
I buy the franchise...
exactly.
That's the business model?
Okay. So, Derek,
what is the plan
to sell $100,000
of these units?
We're starting to get agreements
with area developers right now.
For example, in Chicago,
someone says to me, "Hey--
I need 50 franchises opened.
"I'm willing
to put down $150,000
"to start off in equipment
to get this out there
in Chicago."
So wait, wait,
let me get this straight--
You have not sold
any of these yet?
Nope. We just--
So you haven't had
a chance to test it, right?
Yeah.
And you're going out
and you're selling franchises
to area developers...
who are--
Who are then gonna, in turn,
go and sell them to franchisees?
Exactly.
Horrible!
Horrible!
How do you really feel
about it?
Horrible!
Because you haven't tested it.
Anybody who's done anything
in technology knows
that the only certainty
is that it's gonna screw up.
Derek, why don't you go
to the busiest steakhouse
near where you live,
and say to the person there
that owns it,
"Let me install this
for free.
"you've got 500 coats
coming in here every night.
Let me watch it work
for 90 days."
Why wouldn't you do that?
I want to. It's just too warm
right now in Indianapolis.
(sharks laugh)
I love it!
So it's seasonal.
How many of those coats
did you steal yourself?
You're asking for 10%
for $200,000, right?
Yes, I know this.
So for $2 million
that you're valuating
your company at,
you are a thief.
Let me tell you why
I'm valuating it at $2 million.
I'm so fascinated.
I would love to hear why.
We have a patent on
our ticketless bailment system.
Bailment?
Bailment--It's whenever you hand
over a belonging to someone,
and they keep it
for a certain period of time.
Give me another example.
Valet, dry cleaning,
rental services,
um, any kind of
baggage holding services.
Oh.
You have a patent
on all of that?
Yes.
That's--That's interesting. But--
You're not investing
in just coat checks.
We want to get this
into all the different
bailment situations.
You're just in
the development stage.
Exactly.
What's the whole capital cost
to put all this together?
We were gonna sell it
for $1,500.
Walk us through the money.
How much do you charge
to check a coat?
Anywhere from $2 to $5,
depending on the scale
of the event.
How do you pay the people
that own the venue?
Revenue split. We gain
15% of revenue.
15? 1-5?
15. 1-5.
Are there any other competitors
out there like this?
Nothing like this at all.
I know a little bit
about this space.
And unfortunately,
I think you're incorrect.
There are similar products.
I don't think you're educated
enough in this space,
but I think
you have a lot of drive.
I'm out.
You don't have a--a plan
for distribution and sales,
which is the greatest challenge.
You can only sell this
six months of the year.
It's a seasonal sale.
Summer comes along,
nobody cares.
I hate seasonal businesses.
And for that reason, Derek,
I'm out.
It struck me like it takes
entirely too long
to check in a coat.
What we're gonna do is,
essentially,
it's gonna be an iphone app,
you just come up,
scan your Q.R. Code.
(Barbara) I think it's easier
to get a ticket and run.
I'm out.
So, Derek, let's take stock
of where we're at right now.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
You've got three
sharks out.
Mm-hmm.
On either end are two
that are still in.
Mm-hmm.
I'd ignore
the guys in the middle.
Start working on trying to get
some money out of these people.
Okay. Well, I'd like
to say one thing--
I'm just out of college.
This is why I'm here.
I'm trying to figure out
the best ways to scale this.
One of my partners
is my professor
who did venture capital
and entrepreneurial finance.
You know--
Derek, I like the idea.
You can go to universities
and other venues,
you franchise it
down the road...
Mm-hmm.
And that becomes part of
the proprietary advantage,
is you lock those venues down.
So you do
a multiyear contract
with dance halls, sports bars,
and places like that.
Museums, malls.
And then you hire a couple guys
to try to pitch it
to dry cleaners
or places like that.
But it's worth
$2 million, Robert.
I--I can't get
to the $2 million.
Help me out there.
I'm willing to negotiate.
(laughs)
Oh, you think?
You gotta start high.
I mean, come on.
Let's be real here.
And at the same--You know,
I'll take more money.
Let's talk--
Let's talk numbers.
(sharks laugh)
You will take more money?
I wanna be clear on that.
Robert, I don't know
a guy in the hood,
I know a guy
in Beverly Hills
that'll go around hanging
your coats for $2 million.
(laughter)
Mark, where are you at
with this?
Look, I like it, but I need
to know more about you.
Okay.
Okay, so you walk
in the door,
and I'm telling you,
your business plan is horrible.
(Robert)
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty bad.
What plan?
What do you mean, "what plan"?
here's the plan--
I wanna get $2 million
and leave.
There's gonna be
hard decisions to make.
Are you the type of person
that you'll do the right thing
and you'll make
the hard decisions?
That's what I want
to know.
I don't--
Yes, but I'm all open
to listening to people
who have been there before.
So, Derek, I-I love this.
I just...
make me another offer
Under $2 million.
I can't get
to the $2 million.
Um...
uh...
I asked for $200,000
because it's-It's a start.
It's gonna get me
to commercialization.
He--He asked you
a very, very simple question.
Slow down and think about it
one more time.
Derek, everybody checked out
on your valuation.
$2 million, $1.5 million.
You basically have
an experiment--
No disrespect to you.
I have other people
involved, and...
(Barbara)
Who are telling you "No."
(Daymond) counter.
They are telling me "No."
Counter.
Uh...
do you know
how few people get
what you have right now
in your hand,
in "Shark Tank"?
practically nobody!
I know.
Let him answer.
I get it.
Well, he has nothing
right now.
I--
Let him answer.
$200,000 for 20%.
No.
Wow. I admire the guts.
Thanks, guys, for your time.
Unbelievable.
Now I've seen everything.
I'm in dead shock
that I just turned down
a deal from Mark Cuban.
It's--I-I still to this moment
don't know...
just don't know what happened.
