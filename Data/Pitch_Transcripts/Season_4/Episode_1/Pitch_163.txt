My name is Todd Miller.
I'm a licensed massage therapist
and founder of
the bodywalking institute.
I am here today
asking for $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
I have a product,
I have a service,
that's going to revolutionize
the massage therapy industry.
Who loves a good massage?
Barbara. Mark.
A truly great
therapeutic massage
is all about applying as much
isolated pressure as possible.
Wouldn't it be smarter
to use our feet?
That's why I have
created bodywalking.
By standing on you,
I am able to limit
blood flow temporarily.
When I come off
that area,
the blood shoots back in there
like a tsunami.
It feels incredible.
I'm able to apply
more pounds per square inch,
which causes the body
to just let go.
I invite one of you to come over
here and experience bodywalking.
Barbara, please come.
I have so much pain
sitting next to this character
for three years.
If you just turn your head
to one side or the other,
whatever's comfortable.
Todd, please,
step on her head.
(laughs)
Mr. Wonderful's stress
is leaving your body.
Are you using
full force, Todd?
What I'm doing is applying
8 to 15 seconds of compression.
It's all about
listening to Barbara's body.
Todd, how much do you weigh?
I weigh 190, sir.
So you're putting 190 pounds
on her leg.
Barb, how does that feel?
I mean,
he is not a small guy.
Barb?
(Robert laughs)
Rigor mortis is
starting to set in.
(Robert laughs)
Can you please
lift Barbara up?
How are you doing
down there?
(mark, ghoulish voice)
she's alive! She's alive!
My god, that was great.
I'm in contact with
the biggest massage therapy
clinic provider in the U.S.
710 outlets,
one certified bodywalker,
and they're $1,500 a head.
That's what you charge
to get certified? $1,500?
Yes, sir.
Todd, hang on.
People walk
on other people's back
for a massage for a <i>long </i>time.
(Barbara) It's not new,
obviously.
Absolutely not.
They've been doing it in Asia
for thousands of years.
Okay, so--
But it's a new angle
for Americans.
Is that what you're saying?
Yes.
How many certified bodywalkers
do you have?
30.
How long did it take you
to enlist those 30?
I've been doing--certifying
bodywalking since 2005.
So you're saying you basically,
uh, did 30 people...
in seven years.
In seven years?
Yes.
Four people a year?
Yes.
It's not sounding great, Todd.
I understand, Robert.
That's why I'm here.
The bottom line is, it works.
As a 20-time ironman
triathlete,
I would not be here
unless it was for bodywalking.
But, Todd, I can't send you
all over America doing massages.
You are correct, sir.
That's why if we have
ten classes a month--
Ten. Just ten--
and we have 20 people
in those classes,
that's revenue of $300,000.
When was the last time
you ran a triathlon?
Almost nine months ago.
And how much training
do you need to do
before you go into
a triathlon?
You're training every day.
Which is your passion?
Mark, I've been thinking
about that question
all freakin' season,
'cause I love your questions.
(laughs)
My passion is
to generate your return
on this investment
quicker than anybody's
ever done.
You haven't given me
an answer, Todd.
Everybody likes to talk about
following their passions,
when in reality, they should be
following their efforts.
Just the time you put
into the triathlon
is time that could be spent
selling,
creating new certifications.
It tells me that my money
and your money
is not your primary focus.
Mark, that's not fair.
It <i>is </i>fair,
because you know what?
No, it's not fair.
It <i>is </i>fair.
That's crap.
No, it's crap, mark.
(Robert speaks indistinctly)
Mark, that's crap.
I understand.
You think triathlon is
this gargantuous thing that
you have to do all the time.
It's what keeps me happy.
You <i>make </i>choices.
(Robert) No way, man.
This guy's not a quitter,
though, mark.
When I had my first company,
I went seven years
without a vacation.
Mark, you--
But my girlfriends--
When my girlfriend says,
"It's me or your company,"
my answer was,
"What was your name again?"
(Robert) Come on, mark.
(speaks indistinctly)
But it doesn't matter.
But your choices
to distribute your effort
among multiple things...
I hear ya,
but if I'm not healthy,
I'm gonna get overweight.
I'm gonna be a problem
to this country.
I'm not interested
in investing in balance.
I'm interested in investing
in somebody whose sole focus
is to be a success
at their business.
And I don't see that in you,
so I'm out.
I have to tell you something.
I am the queen of massages,
and I really,
with all due respect,
do not find this unique
in any way.
I'm out.
I don't see anything
proprietary.
I mean, look--
It goes back to the numbers,
the potential of--
Potential is not sales, Todd.
10% of that market is
40,000 therapists.
Potential is not sales.
I'm out.
I don't think
you've done a good job
of telling us what the plan is
here today.
You haven't proven the model
to sell a product.
So for that reason,
I gotta walk. I'm out.
I'm a very simple man.
I just want to make money.
I'll listen to anybody
until I get to the point
where I realize,
I can't make any money,
and that's where I'm at now
with you.
So for that reason--
Mr. Wonderful, may I...
therapists run up to me
and thank me.
World-Class athletes--
It's all about--
Todd, you're a dead man walking
to me. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Mark) Good luck, Todd.
All the best.
Thank you very much.
I guarantee
once America experiences
bodywalking,
they will run to
their massage therapist
and yell, "become
a certified bodywalker."
