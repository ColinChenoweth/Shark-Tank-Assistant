My name is Todd Miller.
I'm a licensed massage therapist
whatever's comfortable.
Todd, please,
step on her head.
(laughs)
Mr. Wonderful's stress
is leaving your body.
Are you using
full force, Todd?
What I'm doing is applying
8 to 15 seconds of compression.
It's all about
listening to Barbara's body.
Todd, how much do you weigh?
I weigh 190, sir.
So you're putting 190 pounds
on her leg.
Barb, how does that feel?
I mean,
he is not a small guy.
Barb?
(Robert laughs)
Rigor mortis is
starting to set in.
(Robert laughs)
Can you please
lift Barbara up?
How are you doing
down there?
(mark, ghoulish voice)
she's alive! She's alive!
My god, that was great.
I'm in contact with
the biggest massage therapy
clinic provider in the U.S.
710 outlets,
one certified bodywalker,
Yes, sir.
Todd, hang on.
People walk
on other people's back
for a massage for a <i>long </i>time.
(Barbara) It's not new,
obviously.
Absolutely not.
It's not sounding great, Todd.
But, Todd, I can't send you
all over America doing massages.
You are correct, sir.
That's why if we have
ten classes a month--
Ten. Just ten--
You haven't given me
an answer, Todd.
Everybody likes to talk about
following their passions,
when in reality, they should be
following their efforts.
Just the time you put
into the triathlon
is time that could be spent
selling,
creating new certifications.
the potential of--
Potential is not sales, Todd.
10% of that market is
40,000 therapists.
Potential is not sales.
I'm out.
I don't think
you've done a good job
of telling us what the plan is
here today.
You haven't proven the model
to sell a product.
So for that reason,
I gotta walk. I'm out.
I'm a very simple man.
I just want to make money.
I'll listen to anybody
until I get to the point
where I realize,
I can't make any money,
Todd, you're a dead man walking
to me. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Mark) Good luck, Todd.
All the best.
Thank you very much.
I guarantee
once America experiences
bodywalking,
they will run to
their massage therapist
