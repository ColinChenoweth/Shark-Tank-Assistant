Robert herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first
internet companies
for over $350 million.
Good for you.
I like you more now.
(Robert) Wow.
Good for you.
Kevin--Dumped
at the altar again.
Again.
No, not on a wedding day.
You don't know women, Robert,
like I do.
(Robert chuckles)
(Robert) Come on!
There's no way you're--
Do you really think
you can do that?
Do you really think the guy
who's buying the boat
wouldn't know that the original
boat Only costs $35,000?
Here's the problem I have--
you can't scale.
You're limited in the number
of boats you can place
(Robert) Here's the best thing
about your business.
When you can be in business with
somebody you get along with,
that's magical.
Thank you.
But beyond phase one,
there's a lot of holes
in this boat.
It's just not adding up.
I'm out.
Robert, I hear ya.
Our whole goal is to get
to this indoor ride...
(Robert)
That's the entire model?
Yes.
How many users
do you have today?
Oh, we have approximately
110 subscribers right now.
(mark) not me.
(Robert) or more.
Not you? Good for you
not me.
For mark,
we have the cuban plan.
That's where you only need a tie
once a year
so that you can go to
the White House.
(Robert laughs)
How do you get
more subscribers?
We're gonna implement
a referral program.
We've found that
our best advertisers
But there's Only
110 subscribers.
Yeah, that's not the problem.
Look,
the--the problem is, guys,
how--How long do you think you
can sustain getting free press?
Well, let's give you
the benefit of the doubt.
(Robert) I love that model.
It's a fantastic model.
I just don't think you have
enough of a subscriber base
to justify the business.
I think you just gotta
test it out a little more.
I'm out.
Well, with that in mind,
I would love to ask Robert
if he'd be interested
in coming back in,
since now he knows that
he wouldn't be on the hook
for that full $100,000.
If--I know you were interested.
Oh, I-I don't think the $100,000
was--Was my issue.
I'm out at this point.
You've got three sharks left.
Two don't wear a tie.
Barbara?
But I have a strong opinion
on it,
even though
I don't wear a tie.
I think your young guy market
is the perfect person.
I, in fact, very much like
the idea you just mentioned
about marketing it through
college kids.
There's nothing more fun
than getting a little package
in the mail.
Popping out a fresh new tie.
I didn't hear about
double Windsor knots.
(Robert) wow.
I didn't hear about how a check
would lay with this,
(Robert) Daymond, that was
such a great point. Never--
My name is rob Dyer.
I'm a major in
the United States Marine corps,
it'll probably be great
for everybody at home
fighting their own battles.
If we don't get an investment
from the sharks,
My name is Rob Dyer.
I'm an active duty
Marine corps officer
Thanks, rob.
Sir.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir.
I can't even open it. (chuckles)
(laughs)
You'll need a couple of 'em
before you get the strength,
sir.
(sharks laugh)
Thank you.
Like I said, we built this
for the war fighter,
But everyone has
a battle to win.
Rob, I see here it says,
"prepared for
special operations forces."
Are you okay to say that?
You have their approval?
I'm okay to say exactly that.
It's not officially endorsed
by the Marine corps.
This is something
that was created
by Special operations forces
personnel.
(Robert) How did you know
what to put in it?
Yes, sir.
So, rob,
since you--You're an accounting
professor right now
Rob, do you have
any inventory today?
I have no inventory today.
The 80,000 shots
that we have coming in
will be here
in about 10 to 14 days.
Do you have to pay
for the inventory ahead of time?
I do.
So the minute
you place the order,
you gotta put the cash
out there?
I've put 50% of the cash up.
How much cash have you put in
so far?
Of my own personal money?
About $90,000 to $95,000.
Wow.
Whoa.
(Robert) of your money?
Yes.
So, rob, you put up $90,000
or was the total
among 16 people?
I put $90,000.
Total amount in the company
is probably about $240,000-Ish.
Ooh.
Okay.
So is your biggest problem today
in your business
getting sales
or filling existing sales?
Filling existing.
I've got Sellers waiting--
That keep calling me.
"When will I get more?
When will I get more?"
so the $75,000 today,
I'm assuming,
is all going to buy inventory?
Yes.
Okay.
You're successful.
You're giving up 10% today
for $75,000.
What happens tomorrow?
It sounds like the business
isn't generating enough cash
for you to buy inventory.
What if you need another $75,000
or $200,000 or $500,000?
There's gotta be a different way
to build this business
than every time you grow,
having to sell equity
to pay for the inventory.
I think that with the 20,000
caffeinated shots I have coming
Robert, I think you have
a compelling story.
But everybody gets diluted,
not him.
(Robert) Yeah.
Yeah, okay, but I'm out.
The story's very powerful.
It's good enough for a sniper
on the battlefield,
The problem is,
I only get half of you.
Business doesn't work
after 4:00 p.m. Time,
Well, rob, here's what I know.
Marines always find a way.
They do.
So I'm not bothered by the fact
you--You have a full-Time job
serving the country until 4:00.
But I think you're gonna need
more cash
than the $75,000.
So... Here's what I'm thinking.
If Kevin will have me--
$150,000 from the two of us
for 20%.
You know what? Robert's right.
You need more cash.
I'll do that deal with him.
Now you've just doubled
what you came in here for.
I appreciate it.
I'll take $150,000 for 20%
Thank you very much.
Congrats, rob.
Thanks, guys.
(Robert) Yeah, thanks.
Team ruckpack is hugely excited
about this deal.
With twice as much money,
we can kick twice as much ass.
