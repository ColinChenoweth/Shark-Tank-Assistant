My name is Jackie Courtney,
Hi. My name's Jackie,
Jackie, I thought that women
loved to keep their dress.
I think that the mentality,
what a woman wants on her
wedding day, has really changed.
I mean, arguably,
it is a very personal,
sentimental purchase.
Well, Jackie,
let's ask Barbara.
She's been married
eight times.
(laughs)
You know,
I've been married twice,
You are a nasty beast,
Jackie.
So you actually hold--
I'm not a nasty beast.
I like that.
I'm trying to help girls.
I really am.
Like, it's really
what I wanna do.
I want to ask
this question. All right.
So run me through
the economics--
So a girl sells you
her dress at $2,000.
What do you sell
the dress at?
We like to price a gown,
unless it's very current,
Jackie, look, I've been
married for 23 years.
I've been married
to the same woman.
We bought the dress
that we could afford,
Jackie, isn't it True
that one of the reasons you want
to keep the wedding dress
is to see if your wife
fits in it 20 years later?
(sharks laugh)
All right, Jackie. You know,
this is such a crapshoot.
Jackie has an offer
on the table from Kevin,
but he wants 30% more equity
than she initially offered.
I'll give you the 35k.
I want 40%.
40%?
Yep.
Are there
any other offers?
All roads lead
to Mr. Wonderful.
All roads?
You know what?
I'm a romantic.
Are you?
I love weddings.
I cry at all weddings.
You--You do?
Yes.
All right. All right.
I cry to see 50%
of somebody's net worth
going out the window.
(laughs)
(mark) I think it's
a very good idea.
I think you're on
your way to something,
but you're too press-Driven,
No chance, Jackie.
Because we are--
No chance?
Zero chance.
Zero chance?
Zero.
40%, final offer.
That's it.
I was gonna ask for 51%...
Oh, really?
So I could fire you
if it didn't work.
But I'm not that kind of guy.
(laughs)
Um, then respectfully,
I think I'm gonna
have to decline.
But I thank you
for your time.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Jackie, you're dead to me.
(sharks laugh)
Good luck, Jackie.
Thank you.
See you guys.
You know what? Discount weddings
are the future.
You'd rather put the $10,000
into the down payment
on a house.
Wouldn't you rather
buy a $600 dress
that you keep forever?
No!
You don't wear dresses.
