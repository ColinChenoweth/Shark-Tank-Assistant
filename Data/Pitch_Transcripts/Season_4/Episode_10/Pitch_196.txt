Robert herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first
internet companies
for over $350 million.
And mark cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas mavericks.
I'm gonna cry, Robert.
And for our kids,
so I-I just don't
buy into the concept.
Right. I-I mean,
I understand.
That's not
the entire market.
I just think
that's not...
that's not everybody.
No, I hear you,
but I don't believe
in this concept.
I'm out.
Good for you.
I like you more now.
(Robert) Wow.
Good for you.
Kevin--Dumped
at the altar again.
Again.
No, not on a wedding day.
You don't know women, Robert,
like I do.
(Kevin and Barbara laugh)
(Robert chuckles)
(Robert) Come on!
There's no way you're--
Do you really think
you can do that?
Do you really think the guy
who's buying the boat
wouldn't know that the original
boat Only costs $35,000?
What we're selling is the--
and while we're contemplating
those margins,
get me some more wine.
(laughs) Yeah, no kidding!
Yes, sir!
I can do that right now!
(mark) I'm down for that.
A big part of owning
your own business
is customer service
and problem solving.
You understand that
you need to, uh--
I'm gonna understand it better
with one more glass, though.
(laughter)
Well, let's--Let's get you
drinking, mark.
That's what we can do here.
Stage three?
Stage Three is actually
to go to our pesto torte,
which you're trying there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
And stage four--
Pesto torte phase?
(mark laughs)
What is that?
The pesto torte is what
we think--a great appetizer,
and we would love to be able
to market that to stores.
(Kevin and daymond laugh)
You're gonna be selling
this little dish I just enjoyed
to stores as a piece
of your business plan?
They're not.
They're absolutely not,
but what I figured was you guys
might want a piece of that.
Our focus, you know, is--
(laughs) It's like a bonus
you throw in.
I just wanna really make sure
that I heard what you said.
You put three crackers here
and whatever This is on this,
and you're gonna also create
an ancillatory business
selling this to stores?
(laughs) the pesto.
If you guys see that
as a feasibility, then yes.
If not,
then that's not our focus.
And stage four,
if you wanna know,
is to make an indoor dinner ride
in las vegas.
(men) WHOA!
(Barbara) Wow!
Yeah!
Indoor--We left the ocean
and everything?
(laughing)
We wanna take it indoors.
We want it--
a boat experience indoors?
Now that's--That's years
and years down the line.
I did not see stage four coming,
I gotta be honest.
Inside for adult alcoholics?
For adult alcoholics, correct.
Cheer, cheer!
Cheer, cheer!
Captain, my captain.
Hip, hip, hoorah!
Well, usually after
you start drinking
the boat starts rocking anyway,
right?
(laughs)
You're making money,
you're--You're having fun
with it.
You know, all you do is drive
around drunk people--Cheers--
And have a great time.
Here's the problem I have--
you can't scale.
You're limited in the number
of boats you can place
in any one bay.
I understand.
And you're really limited
in how many places you can go.
I'm looking for
a significant return.
I just can't get there.
I'm taking the anchor.
I'm out.
Thank you for your time.
(Robert) Here's the best thing
about your business.
When you can be in business with
somebody you get along with,
that's magical.
Thank you.
But beyond phase one,
there's a lot of holes
in this boat.
It's just not adding up.
I'm out.
Robert, I hear ya.
Our whole goal is to get
to this indoor ride...
(laughter)
And there are steps
to get there.
(Robert)
That's the entire model?
Yes.
How many users
do you have today?
Oh, we have approximately
110 subscribers right now.
And the reason is, we took
these first six months
and we're using it as
a proof of concept.
Before we dumped a significant
amount of money into this,
we wanted to be able
to prove
that this would do
what we thought it did.
I wear a tie every day.
I spend thousands every year
on ties.
I buy them
all around the world.
You do? Really?
I look--And I look spectacular.
But they're all black.
(men laugh)
I look spectacular in them.
Now at the end of the day,
what I wanna know is,
where you add value for me?
Well, k-Kevin,
here's how we add value.
For example, our most--Our most
popular plan right now,
the two tie at a time plan,
that's $15.99 a month.
If you're diligent about
when you receive your ties,
wearing it, and sending it back
the next day,
you can get up to 8 to 10 ties
per month.
A lot of our ties retail
anywhere from $80 to $90.
So that's over $700 a month
for $15 a month.
How do we send it back?
Um...
well, I'll actually--I'll
show you the, uh, packages
that you would receive.
Gentlemen, most of
the sharks here, I'm sure,
spend $300
on every tie they wear.
(mark) not me.
(Robert) or more.
Not you? Good for you
not me.
For mark,
we have the cuban plan.
That's where you only need a tie
once a year
so that you can go to
the White House.
(Robert laughs)
How do you get
more subscribers?
We're gonna implement
a referral program.
We've found that
our best advertisers
are guys that wear our ties,
and they go out, and people say,
"Hey, that's a great tie.
Where'd you get it?"
and they say, "It's tietry.
It's a rental."
Well, are you planning on
Carrying any other category?
Any other haberdashery such as
cuff links? Anything else?
We--we are. Yes.
We can go to cuff links,
suspenders,
vests, watches, sunglasses.
Well, and the beauty of it is,
for $16 a month,
if you get the tie and you don't
like it, you just send it back.
There's no commitment either,
so somebody can sign up
for, you know, $16,
and--And if they say, "this
isn't for me," they just cancel.
Or if you need a tie
for a special event--
You realize there's
a challenge here, guys.
'cause how long have you
actually been renting the ties?
We launched in January--
Uh, basically a soft launch.
So you really haven't had to
deal with the issue of turn.
Yet you know people can cancel
at any moment.
What percentage of turn
do you think you'll get?
Well, our--Our--Our renewal rate
is, uh, basically 85% so far.
So 15% turn so far?
But there's Only
110 subscribers.
Yeah, that's not the problem.
Look,
the--the problem is, guys,
how--How long do you think you
can sustain getting free press?
Well, let's give you
the benefit of the doubt.
A thousand people
subscribed.
You guys danced around
your apartments
and you high fived,
and "ooh! A thousand people!"
but it's Only gonna take
a 15% turn per month,
it's gonna take
less than seven months
for those thousand
to disappear,
and you have to
replace them.
If we do lose
those 15% of subscribers,
the next 15% of subscribers
we get,
we don't have to replace
inventory for them
'cause we already have
the inventory for them.
But that's great,
but it's not my point.
N-No, let--Let me address
your point.
With our subscription model,
if we sell
a thousand subscriptions,
the next month, we're gonna sell
a thousand subscriptions.
(Robert) I love that model.
It's a fantastic model.
I just don't think you have
enough of a subscriber base
to justify the business.
I think you just gotta
test it out a little more.
I'm out.
Well, with that in mind,
I would love to ask Robert
if he'd be interested
in coming back in,
since now he knows that
he wouldn't be on the hook
for that full $100,000.
If--I know you were interested.
Oh, I-I don't think the $100,000
was--Was my issue.
I'm out at this point.
You've got three sharks left.
Two don't wear a tie.
Barbara?
But I have a strong opinion
on it,
even though
I don't wear a tie.
I think your young guy market
is the perfect person.
I, in fact, very much like
the idea you just mentioned
about marketing it through
college kids.
There's nothing more fun
than getting a little package
in the mail.
Popping out a fresh new tie.
And plus,
they're easy to ship.
But what I don't like is that
you only have 110 subscribers.
You can't get an investor
in this deal yet.
It hasn't been proven.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Barbara.
Ooh.
So close, yet so far.
(laughs)
Daymond, as you know, it's about
who can get out there first
and who can gain
market share.
So I didn't hear
not one word about fashion
in this whole discussion.
Is that a good or bad thing?
I didn't hear about
double Windsor knots.
(Robert) wow.
I didn't hear about how a check
would lay with this,
or the cuff links
and the beauty and the love,
and the excitement about
the beauty of a tie.
Mm.
And for that reason, you're not
obsessed over this business
like we all are
over our businesses.
I'm out.
Amen! Well said.
Wow.
(Kevin) ooh.
Boy, that's cold.
Well, as our sign
back here says,
we believe a stately neck
is manhood's manliest part.
And So, uh, we do feel
that way.
I'm sorry we didn't get there
sooner, obviously.
There's one
non-Tie-Wearing shark left.
Well, mark, we're asking you
to invest in us.
We--we can make this work.
One question--What's your cost
of customer acquisition
once you get beyond
the P.R. Phase?
Because
it's proof of concept,
we're still trying to find
that number.
But we believe that we can
provide customers
at about $10 to $12 a month,
which is about the cost
of one month's subscription.
But you've never tested that.
We--we had some testing,
but we certainly don't have
mountains and mountains of data
at this point.
The--but with
the referral program,
uh, you know, that--
That would cost us about--
That would be about $10 a month.
That's a stretch.
You guys are guessing.
You guys are hoping.
You don't have a solution.
You haven't
thought this through.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Ouch!
Ouch. I was the only one
that believed in you.
It's not too late,
Mr. Wonderful.
And you failed to convince
one other shark,
and now all I can say is
you're both dead to me.
I'm out.
Bye.
(mark and daymond)
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
(Barbara) Good luck.
(Robert) Daymond, that was
such a great point. Never--
and he would know that.
He's a fashion guy.
And I couldn't put my finger
on what was wrong with it.
They had no passion.
They l--No passion.
Daymond, you were--
Were dead on it.
You nailed it.
All right.
Even though we didn't get a deal
with the sharks,
we feel like, uh, they really
believed in what we were doing.
We were just here
a little too early.
My name is rob Dyer.
I'm a major in
the United States Marine corps,
and I'm stationed
in annapolis, Maryland.
(calling cadence)
currently,
I'm a military professor
at the United States
naval academy.
When I'm not teaching
at the academy,
I'm a husband, I'm a father,
and I'm a business owner.
Boom!
My family's awesome.
I have a beautiful wife.
I have a 3-year-Old son.
Mwah!
Mwah!
it'll probably be great
for everybody at home
fighting their own battles.
If we don't get an investment
from the sharks,
we'll continue to try and grow
as fast as we can.
But with our small amount
of capital,
we cannot keep up with demand.
I can't help but think
that there's people out there
fighting
that don't have our product
that should.
My name is Rob Dyer.
I'm an active duty
Marine corps officer
and my product is
ruckpack combat nutrition.
I'm seeking $75,000
for 10% of my company.
What is ruckpack?
It's the world's first
Peak performance nutrition shot,
and it was designed and tested
by Spec ops forces.
Typical missions for us
last up to a week or more,
and the only food we have
is the food we carry with us.
Because of this,
virtually all of us are taking
some sort of supplement
or energy shot,
and the energy shots
that are out right now suck.
They suck.
They boost you up
and then they bring you
right down with a crash.
And in that environment,
lives can be lost if you're not
operating at 100%.
So a team of marines
created ruckpack.
We all want energy,
but our snipers insist on it
being caffeine-free energy.
Sitting behind
the sniper scope for hours
is exhausting,
But caffeine jitters
simply aren't an option for us.
Ruckpack helps you increase
your mental acuity
so that we can shoot, move,
and communicate
faster than the enemy.
So I brought some
for you guys to try.
Thanks, rob.
Sir.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir.
I can't even open it. (chuckles)
(laughs)
You'll need a couple of 'em
before you get the strength,
sir.
(sharks laugh)
Thank you.
Like I said, we built this
for the war fighter,
But everyone has
a battle to win.
With your capital
and our business plan,
ruckpack will help everyone win
life's battles.
Thank you
for this incredible opportunity.
I'll answer any questions
you have.
Let me first say thank you
for serving our country.
Absolutely.
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
We're not here without you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
This story is so fantastic
for all the servicemen.
They know exactly what
you're talking about.
Are you trying
to translate that story
into the general population,
saying,
this is better
than anything else
because it's good enough
for you?
Is that the story?
Yes, sir,
that's exactly what happened.
We built it by
the symptoms that we wanted
to fix out in the field.
When everybody else
started calling us
and saying, "Hey, I hear you got
this spec ops shot.
How do I get my hands on it?"
who is the "Everybody else"
That started calling you,
and how did they find out
about it?
Friends and family. We spent
zero money on marketing.
Can I buy this in Retail?
Uh, you can buy it
in some small retail stores.
Like some independent--Like,
quantico, Virginia...
(chuckles) for a while
was locked down
with all the independent
7-Eleven owners,
the marines shops there--
You know, the uniform stores--
All had ruckpack
on the counter.
Are they still selling it?
No, they're out, sir.
So you don't have
any inventory right now...
correct.
And you need capital
for inventory?
We immediately took everything
we had an reinvested it,
and I've got 80,000 shots
on their way
in the next 10 to 15 days.
(daymond)
What does "Ruck pack" mean?
Is there a significance
behind the name?
Yes. So a military ruck
is that big backpack you wear,
with all the bags
and it carries all the gear.
Okay.
The great part about that ruck
is that you don't store
your favorite Pillow
from mommy,
or your favorite picture
of your doggie in there.
You only have in there
exactly what you need
and nothing else.
Got it. Okay.
Rob, I see here it says,
"prepared for
special operations forces."
Are you okay to say that?
You have their approval?
I'm okay to say exactly that.
It's not officially endorsed
by the Marine corps.
This is something
that was created
by Special operations forces
personnel.
(Robert) How did you know
what to put in it?
And do you have a patent on
a formula or some proprietary--
Well, we do have
proprietary ingredients
in the formula, ma'am.
But we have...
some ingredients
have to be disclosed
because of, you know,
recommended daily allowances
and we do that,
but we do have some ingredients
that are proprietary
just for us.
The ingredients themselves
are really not that--
I mean, they're--
they're important,
but that's not
the Barrier to entry.
The Barrier to entry
is marketing.
It's an energy drink,
and the differentiator is
army special ops.
So the challenge here is,
how do we get it out
into the general market?
With just a couple of tweaks,
it's a nutrition shot.
This is like a--This is like
a daily vitamin that you take.
You should have ruckpack.
If you take
a different energy shot,
you should really watch
when you use them
because they're really
not good for you.
So it's better?
This is good for you.
Okay.
This is healthy.
Are you working full-time now
in the military?
Yes, sir. I'm an active duty
Marine corps Officer.
My current duty station
is annapolis, Maryland.
Mm.
I'm an accounting professor
at the United States
naval academy.
And before you were that,
what were you in civilian life?
Well, before I was doing that,
I had jobs with Spec ops units.
Spec op units--
Are you in special forces?
Well, right now,
I'm an accounting professor.
But before that, were you?
(laughter)
Yes, sir.
You were in special forces?
Yes, sir.
So, rob,
since you--You're an accounting
professor right now
and you're working,
obviously...
Yes, sir.
"a," how much more time
do you have left
as an accounting professor
or your, um, your next--
Two and a half years.
So who runs the company while
you're operating as a professor?
Well, while I'm operating
as a professor,
that job ends for me
at 4:00 p.m. Every day.
I go home, spend a little time
with family,
and then I start ruckpack.
So you asked for $75,000
for 10%.
Yes, sir.
Um, so you're valuing
the company at $750,000.
Yes.
What--what do you want to do
with the money,
and where are you currently?
I want to scale
my manufacturing.
I know that if
I order enough,
I can work the cost down
to close to 50 cents.
And what's your cost today?
My costs today are about
80 to 85 cents.
80, 85.
(Robert) And what are you
selling it for today?
$2.19 online, and my direct
Sellers are getting $1.65.
When you sent out that product
before, it sold out.
Yes.
How many bottles?
How quick did it sell out?
15,000 shots in a little over
a month and a half.
Rob, do you have
any inventory today?
I have no inventory today.
The 80,000 shots
that we have coming in
will be here
in about 10 to 14 days.
Do you have to pay
for the inventory ahead of time?
I do.
So the minute
you place the order,
you gotta put the cash
out there?
I've put 50% of the cash up.
How much cash have you put in
so far?
Of my own personal money?
About $90,000 to $95,000.
Wow.
Whoa.
(Robert) of your money?
Yes.
And you mentioned "We"
a few times.
Do you have partners
in the business?
I do. We are--
The company itself has
16 total owners.
Wow.
It's 80% military family-Owned.
And what percentage do you own?
How much do you still own?
I own 43%.
My wife Owns almost 2%.
So, rob, you put up $90,000
or was the total
among 16 people?
I put $90,000.
And how much did you raise
from the other 15 people total?
Total amount in the company
is probably about $240,000-Ish.
Ooh.
And of--of that,
you put up $90,000 yourself?
Yes.
Wow.
What did you spend it all on?
Yeah, that seems like a lot.
Web sites, r&amp;d.
We did
the first 20,000 shots,
so now
I still have the money
to already pay for
the 80,000 shots.
I also--Because caffeine is
the largest drug in the world--
I would be stupid
not to at least offer
a caffeinated shot,
so I have
20,000 of those coming
that I've already
paid for as well.
Okay, so you prepaid your--
No, product.
Basically,
you prepaid inventory.
Yes, sir. Yes, we have.
(daymond)
Yes, you have inventory.
Okay.
So is your biggest problem today
in your business
getting sales
or filling existing sales?
Filling existing.
I've got Sellers waiting--
That keep calling me.
"When will I get more?
When will I get more?"
so the $75,000 today,
I'm assuming,
is all going to buy inventory?
Yes.
Okay.
You're successful.
You're giving up 10% today
for $75,000.
What happens tomorrow?
It sounds like the business
isn't generating enough cash
for you to buy inventory.
What if you need another $75,000
or $200,000 or $500,000?
There's gotta be a different way
to build this business
than every time you grow,
having to sell equity
to pay for the inventory.
I think that with the 20,000
caffeinated shots I have coming
and the 80,000 shots that I have
of the nutrition shot,
I'll be able
to do that already.
The $75,000 that you give me
will just be so that there's
not a backlog.
Unfortunately, I've invested
in similar products that would
compete against this.
I'm out.
Understood. Thank you.
I appreciate your time.
Robert, I think you have
a compelling story.
And who wouldn't
fall in love with you?
I'm in love with you.
I'm a little in love
with you, too.
(laughs)
You're a Younger model of my
husband who went to annapolis,
and I think I'm gonna trade
him in and marry you instead.
(mark and Robert laugh)
But I am troubled
by the, uh, $240,000 invested.
It seems like a lot of money
for where you stand right now.
I'm also troubled by the fact
that you have...
43% interest?
Yes.
And you're willing to give away
another 10%, which puts you--
I just feel like you're
eating away at the company
and don't have enough
to show for it.
But everybody gets diluted,
not him.
(Robert) Yeah.
Yeah, okay, but I'm out.
The story's very powerful.
It's good enough for a sniper
on the battlefield,
and I want the same product
for me.
This whole jittery finger thing,
caffeine--I buy into 100%.
I get it. Everybody'll get that
right away.
Normally, I would want more,
but I like it a lot.
This is very uncharacteristic
of me.
I'll give you what you want.
What?!
I'll give you 75k for 10%.
I'll simplify things.
I love the idea.
I-I'd love the opportunity
to invest in you.
The problem is,
I only get half of you.
Business doesn't work
after 4:00 p.m. Time,
and it doesn't work
on a schedule.
And when things have to happen,
they have to happen.
You've gotta be there
when the business needs you,
and I don't see that
as being possible right now,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Okay. Understood.
Well, rob, here's what I know.
Marines always find a way.
They do.
So I'm not bothered by the fact
you--You have a full-Time job
serving the country until 4:00.
But I think you're gonna need
more cash
than the $75,000.
So... Here's what I'm thinking.
If Kevin will have me--
$150,000 from the two of us
for 20%.
You know what? Robert's right.
You need more cash.
I'll do that deal with him.
Now you've just doubled
what you came in here for.
I appreciate it.
I'll take $150,000 for 20%
from Mr. O'Leary
and Mr. Herjavec.
(Robert and Kevin) All right!
(mark) Congratulations, guys.
First thing we do is
we Mount operations,
take out both of his drinks.
(Barbara laughs)
Thanks, guys.
Really appreciate it.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Congrats, rob.
Thanks, guys.
(Robert) Yeah, thanks.
Team ruckpack is hugely excited
about this deal.
With twice as much money,
we can kick twice as much ass.
