My name is Jackie Courtney,
and I live
in Brooklyn, New York.
When I got married
a year ago,
I had a hard time finding
a dress that I loved
and that I could afford.
I, like most brides,
want that dream dress
that I've seen in magazines.
Those dresses, however,
cost upwards of $10,000,
which is a price,
in today's economy,
that most girls can't afford.
My business, nearly newlywed,
is an online boutique
for modern brides
to buy and sell high-End,
nearly new wedding dresses.
And let me know if you
have any other questions.
I'm totally available.
This business means a lot to me.
Right now, I'm working
out of my 1-Bedroom apartment
and there's wedding
dresses everywhere.
I need an investment
from the sharks
so I can take a great idea
and turn it into
the big business that
I know it can be.
It's just the beginning.
Hi. My name's Jackie,
and the name of my company
is nearly newlywed.
I'm here today asking
for a $35,000 investment
in exchange for 10% ownership
in my company.
Nearly newlywed
is an online boutique
that's offering
a new way for girls
to shop
for their wedding dresses.
When I was growing up
in iowa,
I couldn't get enough
of the glitz and glamour
I saw in magazines,
so I moved to New York city
to be a part of it all.
I went to work
as a fashion publicist,
getting to dress
celebrities and editors,
and what really surprised me
was that they all borrowed
everything
they wore on the red carpet.
Unfortunately,
I'm not a celebrity,
which I quickly realized
when planning my wedding.
The dresses I loved
were so expensive.
So I created
nearly newlywed.
Let me take you
on a quick tour.
If you visit our site,
you can see some of the newest
dresses we've gotten in,
like this marchesa.
This marchesa gown retails
for $11,000 in stores,
But at nearly newlywed,
you can have it
for just $3,800.
What's even better
is our sell-it-back guarantee.
After your wedding,
you can sell it back to us
for 50% of what you paid,
making this $11,000 dress
available to girls
for only $1,900.
The inspiration for what I'm
doing was really my own wedding.
I was married last June
to my husband Patrick.
That same dress
has been worn
by multiple brides,
as you can see in just
a sampling of their photos here.
And here it is,
looking gorgeous
on Kate today.
We just launched,
but our growth
has been incredible.
So I would love
to partner with one of you
to meet the demand.
Jackie, I thought that women
loved to keep their dress.
I think that the mentality,
what a woman wants on her
wedding day, has really changed.
I mean, arguably,
it is a very personal,
sentimental purchase.
Well, Jackie,
let's ask Barbara.
She's been married
eight times.
(laughs)
You know,
I've been married twice,
and I almost didn't keep
my first wedding dress,
but I wore it again
when I found my second husband.
You did?
Yes.
So there you go.
You're a perfect example
of wearing it again.
But let me ask you--
to me, what's the difference
between this and renting a gown?
There's nothing
that's long-term,
flexible, and has
the selection that we have.
This is essentially
the convenience of renting
with options.
You can alter it.
It's yours, in your closet.
Can you alter a rental gown?
Uh, no.
Oh, well,
that's an important difference.
It's like a used car.
She buys it, she sells it,
she buys it, she sells it.
I mean, they can't,
you know, Dye the dress purple.
How many do you have
in inventory now?
We started with just 30,
and we just tripled
our inventory
in the last--last week.
Tripled?
So you're laying out capital?
You buy these?
We're not laying out
any capital.
How--Oh, do tell.
We have almost
$300,000 worth of inventory
of--That's the resale price,
not the retail price.
When you buy
that $11,000 dress,
what are you paying
for it?
Nothing.
So you're getting them
on consignment from who?
We're getting them
on consignment from brides...
Ah.
Stylists, and we are--
Actually,
we've already
been approached
by designers and boutiques
to collaborate.
So you do not pay
for the inventory
until you have sold it?
That's correct.
(Barbara) That's a huge profit.
So you're ebay--You're ebay
for wedding dresses.
(Barbara) And no cash flow--
Interesting, Jackie.
Interesting.
You are a nasty beast,
Jackie.
So you actually hold--
I'm not a nasty beast.
I like that.
I'm trying to help girls.
I really am.
Like, it's really
what I wanna do.
I want to ask
this question. All right.
So run me through
the economics--
So a girl sells you
her dress at $2,000.
What do you sell
the dress at?
We like to price a gown,
unless it's very current,
and really in demand--
So you have
a standard margin?
Yes. It's 30% to 40%.
If a woman is looking
at an $11,000 dress
and she can't afford it,
why doesn't she buy
an $800 dress?
I don't think
that's our girl.
I think it's a girl
that can afford a $5,000
and buys a $10,000.
My daughters are now
planning their wedding dress,
and they're 14.
Mm-hmm. Right.
(laughs)
I hope it's a long way away.
Right.
But it's such--
Just hope there's
no shotguns involved.
Well, no, but, you know,
it's such a personal thing
for them.
No, it is,
but if they came to you
and said...
I'm thinking the only time
a woman is gonna get
a used dress
is if she's divorced.
I completely disagree.
(laughs)
If your daughter
came to you
and said,
"I want a $20,000 dress,"
and I said, "I have
that dress for her for $7,000."
Do you think that she
wouldn't give it a chance,
try it on?
No, I'd say,
"call uncle mark,
and he'll pay it for you."
Yeah.
All they--All that
matters is,
does it look good
when they're wearing it,
and does it look good
in the pictures, right?
What are your sales, Jackie?
Well, we just launched,
so, I mean, our sales data
is pretty small,
because--
But what are they?
What are they?
Walk us through a dress.
We've sold 4
of our first 30 dresses
in the last 30 days.
Four dresses?
That's nothing.
Right, but we just started.
Looking forward,
how are you gonna get
from now to success?
Number one
is building our inventory.
And I think another big Piece
is continuing
the press run we're on.
I mean, we've had--
We've just been featured
by "the Washington post,"
and "Ink" magazine
and "Mashable" Wrote about us
because they think
that we're doing
interesting things
in the tech space.
You built that traffic
because of this initial rush
in P.R.?
Mm-Hmm.
That's very difficult
to sustain.
How are you going to maintain
that type of traffic?
Girls are sharing this
themselves. It's not just p.R.
So facebook is actually
one of the ways
that is driving
the majority of our traffic.
And we have a lot of things
in the works.
We're going to be
in "Martha Stewart,"
recommended things
for the fall issue.
Are you paying for that?
No, we're not.
It's editorial.
And I'm also going to be
featured in "Marie Claire,"
in Their, um,
under-35 entrepreneurs.
We're, um, in talks
to partner with kleinfeld's,
which is one of
the first boutiques
we've been talking with,
um, because we identified them
as, obviously,
the gold standard.
And what would your deal
with them potentially be?
So we're talking
about a few different things.
Um, you know,
they've seen a surge
in women wanting
to sell their gowns.
So recommending
their brides come to us,
we're sort of their
preferred person
for them to consign dresses.
You know, you have a perfect
background for this business,
coming from the P.R. Field.
Yeah, it's definitely been
something that's really helped.
And you're articulate
and you hustle.
Thank you.
All great.
But you know what?
You've been in business
three months,
and you haven't proven
your model.
It's an idea.
It's not a business.
No. It's a baby business.
Certainly.
She's up and running.
Four dresses sold?
(daymond)
Call four dresses a business?
You're up and running.
You've birthed it, okay?
Yes.
Good for you.
Not easily done.
But it is
only three months,
and it's such a wild card.
You haven't proven
your model,
so I'd be afraid
I wouldn't get my money out.
You would get
your money out.
For that--
How would I get
my money out?
If you invested, I would hustle
until you got every penny back,
and more.
But it's three months,
it's not tested.
Too early for me.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Jackie, look, I've been
married for 23 years.
I've been married
to the same woman.
We bought the dress
that we could afford,
and it's really meaningful
to her, to me...
Jackie, isn't it True
that one of the reasons you want
to keep the wedding dress
is to see if your wife
fits in it 20 years later?
(sharks laugh)
And in your case, Kevin,
what's the answer?
Thank goodness.
(laughs)
I love this space,
and I recently got
educated in this space.
And what I recently
got educated on is,
this is the only time
that a female has no rationale,
when it comes to purchasing
on her wedding day.
And--and that's why
I find the space attractive,
because the margins
are 7,000%.
You're starting
to sound like Kevin, daymond.
I want to be
in this space
for the luxury
and the opulence
and the ability to sell
something that's $4
for $4,000.
This does not fit my model.
I'm out.
All right, Jackie. You know,
this is such a crapshoot.
But I like you and I like
how feisty you are.
I gotta have a big chunk
of this thing
if I'm gonna do it,
so I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you the 35k.
I want 40%.
40%?
Yep.
It's an absolute bet on you.
And, you know, you're either
gonna make it or you're not,
but because I love love...
You love love?
I'm willing
to take a chance.
Jackie has an offer
on the table from Kevin,
but he wants 30% more equity
than she initially offered.
I'll give you the 35k.
I want 40%.
40%?
Yep.
Are there
any other offers?
All roads lead
to Mr. Wonderful.
All roads?
You know what?
I'm a romantic.
Are you?
I love weddings.
I cry at all weddings.
You--You do?
Yes.
All right. All right.
I cry to see 50%
of somebody's net worth
going out the window.
(laughs)
(mark) I think it's
a very good idea.
I think you're on
your way to something,
but you're too press-Driven,
and it's too you-driven.
I think your taste
is just so specific
that that'll hurt
the business,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
He's telling you why
I need 40%.
The risk is so huge.
It's an absolute bet on you.
And, you know, you're either
gonna make it or you're not.
Can you come down
a little bit?
No chance, Jackie.
Because we are--
No chance?
Zero chance.
Zero chance?
Zero.
40%, final offer.
That's it.
I was gonna ask for 51%...
Oh, really?
So I could fire you
if it didn't work.
But I'm not that kind of guy.
(laughs)
Um, then respectfully,
I think I'm gonna
have to decline.
But I thank you
for your time.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Jackie, you're dead to me.
(sharks laugh)
Good luck, Jackie.
Thank you.
See you guys.
You know what? Discount weddings
are the future.
You'd rather put the $10,000
into the down payment
on a house.
Wouldn't you rather
buy a $600 dress
that you keep forever?
No!
You don't wear dresses.
Forget about that.
Don't women go back
and look at that stuff?
