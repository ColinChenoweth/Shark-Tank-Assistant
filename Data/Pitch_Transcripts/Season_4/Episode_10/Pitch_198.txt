My name is David powers...
and I'm Scott tindel.
And we're the founders
of tietry.
We're asking you
for a $100,000 investment
in exchange for
a 25% equity stake in tietry.
Tietry is essentially
netflix for neckties.
Scott and I,
both being attorneys,
wear a lot of ties.
But we realized that we were
wearing the same few
over and over.
When we started talking
to other people,
we found out other guys were
just like us.
And that's why a few months ago,
we launched tietry.
Our subscribers get an unlimited
number of neckties delivered
directly to their doorstep
for a low monthly price.
They choose the ties they want
and exchange them
as often as they want.
For the price of
a couple of cups of coffee,
our subscribers
can literally wear
hundreds of dollars worth
of designer neckties
every single month.
We know that tietry is
the perfect business
to break into
the men's access market.
So... y'all wanna tie one on
with tietry?
Okay, guys, what does it cost
you to acquire a customer?
'cause I've never heard
of tietry before.
We launched a few months ago.
So far, we've spent virtually
nothing on advertising.
All--We've been getting our
customers through free press,
free publicity,
and through referrals.
Well, and--Both Scott and I,
we've been working
during the day and night,
living on 5-Hour energy drink,
basically.
Uh, but w-When Scott leaves
his job,
he'll--He'll be able to sell.
Okay, no, stop right there.
Who is he going to sell to?
Are you just gonna walk
up and down the street
and say, "buy a subscription
to tietry"?
Well, if I could go downtown
in downtown mobile
and go to
the biggest office building
where there are hundreds of guys
wearing ties
and go sign up ten guys a day...
go on to the next city.
But then what?
Well--
then you'll be hanging yourself
with those ties.
Daymond, we've been approached
by Three different
college students
on different campuses, wanting
to be campus reps from us.
And--
All right,
let's stop right there.
I'm gonna make things
a little interesting
here in the shark tank.
I like you guys, all right?
But I don't wanna be perceived
as a greedy Mr. Wonderful.
So I'm gonna say I'll put up
$50,000 of what you need,
and I won't say for how much.
I'll let some other shark--
If you can convince one,
or sharkette--Decide
how much of the company
we should own
for the $100,000.
It won't be me.
Boy, I like me sometimes.
(laughs)
You're quite the gentlemen.
There's $50,000 on the table.
Can you convince another shark
to play?
