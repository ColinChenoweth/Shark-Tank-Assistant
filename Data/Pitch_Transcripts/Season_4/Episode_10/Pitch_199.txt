Ahoy, everyone.
I'm captain Nathan buffet.
And I'm Shane cianciolo.
We're here seeking $105,000 for
20% equity in our business...
corks away.
(pops)
People come
from all over the world
to experience our amazing
wine adventure on the high seas.
Upon arrival,
you are greeted
by a coast guard-Approved
captain.
You then proceed
to board the "sunflower,"
our luxurious
30-Foot wine vessel.
Now once Everyone
is safe and secure,
your vessel is ready
for departure.
(clangs)
on board, your senses
will come alive...
(laughs)
As you experience the majesty
of the open waterways
and indulge
in our premium wine tasting.
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.
Your wine host
serves and explains
each of the four
wines and appetizers
that are presented to you
during your ride.
How nice is this?
Good timing.
Oh, welcome aboard.
Thank you.
Now this allows you
to relax... (sighs)
And enjoy your time
out on the water.
Nathan, is this
a singles Cruise?
Should I be hitting on Barbara?
(sharks laugh)
Thank you.
Mmm.
One of our specialty appetizers
is the renowned pesto torte.
(imitates French accent)
a delicious looking morsel, no?
(both laugh)
(Barbara) Ha!
We've served
thousands of guests,
and many return every year
for the intangible experience
that we call...
Wait for it.
(drumroll plays)
Wine on the water.
L-O-L-O-L.
L-O-L-O-L.
(laughs)
We do offer a variety
of different types of cruises.
Uh, you can choose from
beers and cheers cruises,
mimosa cruises,
couples cruises,
sunset cruises--
Whatever the occasion,
we have an atmosphere
specifically tailored
and waiting for you.
So who wants
to come aboard,
and help take
corks away's wine on the water
to the world?
So basically, guys,
it's a booze Cruise
with bad theater?
Well...
(laughs)
It's not a booze Cruise,
it is an experience
for an hour and a half
with only six guests.
And is Nathan
a certified captain?
I am, sir.
Are you seasonal
or All year round?
12 Cruises per week,
all year round.
So why are you here today?
Do you want more boats?
We want to expand. We're
actually stage two of four.
Stage one
was proof of concept.
Uh, we currently have sales
of $250,000 from last year.
(mark and Kevin) Whoa.
(Barbara) Wow!
When you first came out,
I thought you were
two bozos in a boat,
but you're not so dumb.
You've got almost a quarter of
a million in sales on one boat.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
That's not bad.
So go on with your stages.
Uh, stage two is expansion,
and we've found that we--we can
expand this business
into a franchise
for captains who need
a way to make money.
Are you gonna go
to charter captains and say,
"look, you give us your boat,
"you be the captain.
"I have another way
for you to make revenue
when your boat
is not making money."
You're absolutely on it.
To expand their business?
This is an opportunity
for any captain who's wanted
to be able
to own their own business.
He either got a boat,
or he's got his captain license
and wants a boat
and doesn't have one yet.
For $175,000,
we will give you a boat.
We also give you the business
plan to work the boat,
meaning that we have
all of the tools necessary.
So that's
your franchise model?
That's our franchise model.
That's correct.
Interesting.
We make money through--
You sell the guy the boat
for $175,000.
What do you pay for it?
The boat only costs us $35,000.
And you're gonna sell it
to the Skipper for $175,000?
With our business plan, yes.
(high-Pitched voice) What?!
whoa!
Shane, do you know
how crazy that sounds?
It was really crazy for people
to open up a casino
in--in a desert.
True.
Hey, listen,
I think there's
another marketing angle.
So let's say you do something
like the riesling ride.
Right?
Oh, that's a great idea.
That's right, right? So what
is that? Two r's, right?
Yep.
If you add
the relaxing riesling ride,
what would that be?
Oh, lord.
Arr.
"arr, arr, arr."
(laughter)
Right? Yeah.
That's what
I'm falling in love with.
But I have to be honest, guys.
I'm out.
Daymond, thank you for
your time. I appreciate it.
Arr!
I was wrong. I called it
bad theater. It's good theater.
It's good theater.
You guys are comics,
and I actually think you got
a nice little business here.
I would love to have you all
aboard. That would be--
That would really solidify
what it is that we do.
I love boats.
I enjoyed our time together.
I like the wine, also.
Thank you, Kevin.
If there's any left,
I'll have some more.
How many glasses have you had?
I'll keep going...
(mark) Keep going, Kevin...
'cause this deal is just getting
better by the glass.
'cause you finally get
a personality when you drink.
So the way I look at it is,
at the end of the day,
it's not investable,
but it's not horrible.
Just not investable.
There's no way
to get a return from this.
In five years,
we believe--
Now if I have one more glass,
I may change my mind.
(daymond) Ooh.
But you know what?
You're have a great time.
You're making money. You made it
to the shark tank.
You're very nice guys.
Having said all that,
I'm so out.
(chuckles) Thank you, Kevin.
I appreciate it.
Cheers.
Well, Barbara,
it's really up to you,
and we really hope
that you'll consider us.
Come on,
you're such wacky characters.
I would have so much fun
sailing with you guys,
but I couldn't sleep at night
if you had my money.
You're a lot of fun, guys,
but unfortunately I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara,
and I appreciate all your time.
Thanks, guys.
(Shane) Thank you.
(Nathan) Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
I'm the first to buy a ticket
on the indoor ride.
(laughs)
Wow, that was fun.
(daymond) Poor guys.
I have to tell you something,
though, Kevin.
You get a lot nicer once
you have a little bit of wine.
Just keep it coming.
