Greetings. I'm Scotty Claus.
For an all-new episode
of "Shark tank"...
I think I just met
Santa Claus.
Where hopeful entrepreneurs
dream of a chance
to secure an investment
Greetings. I'm Scott Martin.
But I'm more affectionately
known as "Scotty Claus"
Scotty Claus, how much
do you rent the trees for?
The average tree
is about $100.
It goes up to $200.
So it might be more expensive
to rent a $200 tree from you
than it would be
to buy it locally?
Right.
Oh.
We're definitely not trying
to go after that market.
(Daymond)
Why would I pay for that
if I could buy it
at the same price?
(Scott) Let me tell you,
there's people--
Hardy guy I am.
I go into the forest,
I cut my own tree, mark.
So the cache is,
it's the same tree every year,
it becomes part of our family?
Yeah.
The whole symbol
about having a tree
is something that's alive
in your home,
(Robert) Scotty Claus,
I don't want to be a grinch.
I'm not seeing the growth curve.
Okay.
I-I think
it's a good business for you,
not an investment for me.
I'm out.
Okay. Fair enough.
(Mark) Scotty Claus
I-I'm a believer in convenience
with a conscience.
I think you have
some Real challenges
from a capital perspective.
Right.
I think you have
some pricing challenges.
I think you're gonna
have to turn off
the "Let's just be
the nice guy Scotty Claus"--
to that point,
I'm on the "shark tank."
This isn't, you know,
the guppy pond.
I came here
with the idea that
I've gotta be willing
to make some changes.
So if I gave you
the $150,000,
how many more jobs
do you think you can create?
How many more veterans
do you think you could hire?
Oh, man, I could--
I mean, as I keep growing,
I'm--I'm doubling the jobs
because it--it--
I need a set number of people to
deliver the set number of trees.
I mean, that's--That's--
It's 200 jobs.
Okay.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
Is Christmas gonna come early?
Here's what
I'm willing to do.
I'll give you the $150,000...
What do you say,
Scotty Claus?
(laughs) that to me
sounds like a deal, mark.
Let's do it.
All right.
(Robert) Wow.
(chuckles)
(speaks indistinctly)
Appreciate it, Scotty.
Awesome.
Thank you.
Thank you, all.
Boy, did not see that coming.
(Daymond)
I didn't see it either.
I can't explain how excited
I am right now.
It's been something
I have worked so hard,
went through so many long days,
long nights
working at this,
believing in this,
