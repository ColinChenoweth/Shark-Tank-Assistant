Greetings. I'm Scotty Claus.
For an all-new episode
of "Shark tank"...
I think I just met
Santa Claus.
Where hopeful entrepreneurs
dream of a chance
to secure an investment
and gain powerful partners
to start, grow, or save
their businesses.
I give people meaningful jobs
during the holidays.
Is Christmas gonna
come early?
Look, I don't--I don't want
to be a grinch.
If the sharks hear
a great idea,
they're ready to invest
using their own money.
So greedy on this one.
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.
Ignore everything
they just said.
Did you really
just say that?
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
You come in here and you
charge me ten times more?
Are you crazy?
It's sink...
you've done everything
except get dirty.
Or swim.
Kevin, you don't know me.
Oh.
You don't know
how I can fight, Kevin.
This is a brand.
I really hate it, but I still
want a Christmas present.
Yes! (laughs)
Greetings. I'm Scott Martin.
But I'm more affectionately
known as "Scotty Claus"
and the owner of
the living Christmas company.
(laughs)
I'm here today to offer one
or all of you
a 30% stake in my company
for $150,000.
This Christmas story started
when I was 17 years old,
delivering Christmas trees.
It is absolutely the most fun
a teenager can have
while working.
Everybody's happy to see you--
Hugs, kisses,
milk and cookies.
The arrival of a Christmas tree
means that Christmas
had begun in the house.
But that intense joy is curbed
when you drive by
Two weeks later
and see that same tree that
I struggled to get in the house
thrown out
with the rest of the trash.
And that's when it hit me--
why can't I deliver
a live tree
in a container like this
before Christmas
and pick it up afterwards?
In 2008,
I took my napkin sketch
and turned it into a web site.
We rented a hundred trees
and delivered them out of
the back of my pickup truck.
Last year we delivered
over 1,300 trees.
The time has come
to invite a partner.
You see, just because
it's a good idea,
it doesn't make
my trees grow faster.
But money does.
And with an investor
and the right partner,
we can take this national
and change the way the country
celebrates Christmas.
Thank you.
Scotty Claus, how much
do you rent the trees for?
The average tree
is about $100.
It goes up to $200.
So it might be more expensive
to rent a $200 tree from you
than it would be
to buy it locally?
Right.
Oh.
We're definitely not trying
to go after that market.
(Daymond)
Why would I pay for that
if I could buy it
at the same price?
We deliver it to your house
and we pick it up afterwards.
You don't want a tree.
You're looking for
the service of a tree.
Half of the fun of the tree
is going to pick it out
with the family,
you know--
(Barbara) Only for
the first five years.
After that, it's a pain
in the neck.
Yeah.
(Robert) True, Barbara.
What is the process
of picking it out?
Right now,
you can go on-Line.
We have five different trees
to choose from.
We have elves--
Every one has Christmas names--
We have Justin season,
gregnog.
These guys deliver
that tree to your house.
(laughs)
Then pick it up afterwards.
How many markets
are you in?
Right now,
it's Southern california.
(Robert) I like the idea.
Like Barbara said,
first five years, going in the--
in the forest, cutting down
my own Tree was wonderful.
After that, I want somebody
to deliver it.
Going into the forest
and cutting it down?
I didn't say go in the forest
and cutting it down.
(mark and Barbara laugh)
Is that croatian?
No! That's the kind of...
(Scott) Let me tell you,
there's people--
Hardy guy I am.
I go into the forest,
I cut my own tree, mark.
So the cache is,
it's the same tree every year,
it becomes part of our family?
Yeah.
The whole symbol
about having a tree
is something that's alive
in your home,
and the difference of having
something slowly dying
in the corner
or plastic in the corner
as opposed to live tree
is a completely different
experience.
What are the sales?
$150,000.
$150,000 in your season,
which is basically one month.
Yeah, it's a 2-Month season.
And what's your profit
on that?
$33,000.
And that's after
paying yourself?
No, I have not paid myself.
Do I have to pay
if I kill the tree?
On the web site, it says
that there is a penalty.
You go on the naughty list
and--And you get fined.
The fact of the matter is,
if someone's gone
out of their way to rent
a living Christmas tree,
they tend to take care of it.
What do you need?
So I need capital
and infrastructure.
I need a nursery with
an automatic irrigation system.
I need to be able to plant
my own trees from seedlings
and grow them
all the way through.
Then I control my inventory.
Let me tell you all the ways
I hate this business.
Number one, I hate it
because it's Only
for six weeks of the year.
Sure.
Number two, I hate it
because it's more expensive
than just buying it.
So my market is only people
that cumbaya and don't want
to kill at tree.
Sure.
And then number three,
I hate it
because the competition
is a plastic tree
that I can get
that looks identical.
If I hid a plastic tree
in here right now,
you couldn't tell
the difference.
I really hate it. I'm out.
This is very, very attractive
and endearing to me.
It's a green play.
I love that.
I have a-a tree farm.
I've been dying to be
in business with a guy
with a handlebar moustache.
(sharks laugh)
All right?
There's only one thing
higher on my priority list
than being in business
with a guy
with a handlebar moustache.
You know what that is?
What's that?
Being in business with a woman
with a handlebar moustache.
(all laugh)
I'll keep a lookout
for you.
I know the challenges
you're gonna face.
You have the price of gas
going up,
so now you're gonna go
and ship these trees,
then you're gonna pick 'em up
and bring 'em back, right?
The trees grow,
you need to acquire more land.
That means, more fertilizer,
that means more water,
that means more having to deal
with deer and other things
that are killing the trees.
And the--the answers
you're giving me,
you're gonna figure out
are a little Harder
than you think they're gonna be.
So I'm out.
Very sweet of you.
(Robert) Scotty Claus,
I don't want to be a grinch.
I'm not seeing the growth curve.
Okay.
I-I think
it's a good business for you,
not an investment for me.
I'm out.
Okay. Fair enough.
So and--And--And--
And--And so what I'm offering,
it's a $2-Billion market.
One thing we know--
that Christmas is not gonna be
canceled next year.
It's gonna happen.
I feel like I've--I've solved
the deforestation problem,
the convenience problem,
by what we're doing.
(Barbara)
But here's the rub, right?
You've been
in business four years,
and you had a $33,000 profit.
Think about that.
I don't doubt your passion.
Sure.
I'm out
'cause I just don't believe
there's enough profit
in this business.
Fair enough. Thank you.
Okay. What is not
being told here
is what I'm able to do
with the investment I've made
over the last four years,
the dozens of people
I've employed,
and the value
I've been able to create
because I took something
that used to be thrown away
and gave value to it.
I hire vets.
I mean, perfect guys
for delivering Christmas trees.
Guys who know logistics,
know how to get the work done.
But having a business that is
able to give back and make money
and make a profit
is meaningful.
And so I give people meaningful
jobs during the holidays
they wouldn't have had
otherwise.
I set this up
as a for-Profit company
to do well By doing good.
(Mark) Scotty Claus
I-I'm a believer in convenience
with a conscience.
I think you have
some Real challenges
from a capital perspective.
Right.
I think you have
some pricing challenges.
I think you're gonna
have to turn off
the "Let's just be
the nice guy Scotty Claus"--
to that point,
I'm on the "shark tank."
This isn't, you know,
the guppy pond.
I came here
with the idea that
I've gotta be willing
to make some changes.
So if I gave you
the $150,000,
how many more jobs
do you think you can create?
How many more veterans
do you think you could hire?
Oh, man, I could--
I mean, as I keep growing,
I'm--I'm doubling the jobs
because it--it--
I need a set number of people to
deliver the set number of trees.
I mean, that's--That's--
It's 200 jobs.
Okay.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
Is Christmas gonna come early?
Here's what
I'm willing to do.
I'll give you the $150,000...
and I'll take 40%...
and I'll provide you support.
Okay.
You're
the landscape architect.
So all that side of it
is all you.
What I know inside and out.
We're gonna have to
work together to figure out
how to scale this thing.
What do you say,
Scotty Claus?
(laughs) that to me
sounds like a deal, mark.
Let's do it.
All right.
(Robert) Wow.
(chuckles)
(laughs
and speaks indistinctly)
(laughs)
Santa Claus really exists.
(Mark)
No. I'm not Santa Claus.
Trust me. If I can't make money
at it, it's not happening.
We'll create a web site,
we'll put the pictures
of the guys that we hired
and let them show
who delivered the tree.
Right.
We'll create
a history of every tree,
the families
that have owned it
so there's more connection.
There's so many positives
about this
that if the only thing
keeping you from doing this
a thousand times more
is a little bit of money,
money's easy.
Yeah.
Doing the right thing
isn't always.
(speaks indistinctly)
Appreciate it, Scotty.
Awesome.
Thank you.
Thank you, all.
Boy, did not see that coming.
(Daymond)
I didn't see it either.
I can't explain how excited
I am right now.
It's been something
I have worked so hard,
went through so many long days,
long nights
working at this,
believing in this,
and the fact that mark cuban
believes in it, too,
is so invigorating
and so empowering
that I-I can't wait
to share it with the world.
