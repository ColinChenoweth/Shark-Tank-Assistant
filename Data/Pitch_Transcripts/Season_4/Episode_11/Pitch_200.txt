I'm Juliet Boydstun.
(Australian accent)
I'm Lucinda Gould.
(Lucinda)
The Coop is really unique
Hi, I'm Lucinda Lent.
(Juliet)
Yeah. (laughs)
(Juliet) All right.
Correct.
(Lucinda) Yes.
You say you sell out
on a saturday.
How many parties can you
jam in on a weekend?
'cause I assume
that's when the parties are.
Lucinda, you said
a few minutes ago to Kevin
that you will get your money
back within two years.
Did you mean that?
I-I do mean that.
Well, then I'll give you
the $150,000 for the 15%.
I don't want anything more,
but I want
your personal guarantee
you'll give me the money back
in two years.
(Kevin) Whoa, shark.
Personal guarantee.
Just to make sure we know
what's going on here--
she's providing you a loan
I do. (laughs)
I--Juliet does.
Do you own a car?
I own a car, yeah.
So if--If your business
doesn't succeed in--
She owns your car.
