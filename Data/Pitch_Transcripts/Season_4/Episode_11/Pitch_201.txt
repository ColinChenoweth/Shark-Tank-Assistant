I'm Juliet Boydstun.
(Australian accent)
I'm Lucinda Gould.
And we're from
Los Angeles, California.
(both) And we own The Coop.
(Lucinda) Juliet and I
have been friends
for a really long time,
and we had our babies
at the same time,
and every weekend,
we found ourselves
at these nasty, horrible,
dirty kids' places.
We looked at each other,
we were having the same thought.
(laughs) It clicked.
We could do this better.
(cheering)
Happy birthday! Whoo!
(Lucinda)
The Coop is really unique
because your kids
can come and have a blast.
On the outside patio,
you can sip a coffee,
read a magazine,
chat to your girlfriends,
and feel cool.
There's nowhere else
like that in Los Angeles.
Lucinda and I are
fabulous party throwers.
But we don't really have
the business acumen
and background.
We need the sharks to come in
and help us grow the business.
We're gonna
build This brand big,
and there's gonna be
a coop in every city
in this country.
(laughs)
Whoo! (laughs)
(laughs)
Hi, I'm Lucinda Lent.
And I'm Juliet Boydstun.
And we own The Coop.
We are seeking $150,000
for a 15% share
in our company.
We've been friends
since we each moved here
about 18 years ago
and at the start of that time,
when we were young and fabulous,
wearing high heels and going
to cool coffeehouses.
And then we had kids.
And everything changed.
We still hung out together,
but our new hangouts
were built for kids--
Noisy,
cluttered with broken toys,
outdated decor,
and cheesy mascots.
We got so sick of these
cookie-cutter party prisons
that we went in search
of a kids' place
that we could enjoy
as much as our kids.
But we couldn't find it.
So we created The Coop.
"Us Weekly" Magazine
just named us
"the hot tot party spot,"
and we want to show you why.
When we designed The Coop,
we went for clean lines.
We kept all the toys modern.
And unlike most kids' places,
we haven't forgotten about
the parents.
We even have a cappuccino bar.
We sell out every weekend.
We cater to movie stars,
rock stars,
television personalities
and star makers,
right alongside
regular moms just like us.
And today we know that
someone in the sharks
is having a birthday soon.
Coming up.
Mark.
So we are throwing you
a shark-themed
coop birthday party.
Oh, lord.
(laughs)
Whoo!
(singsongy)
Happy birthday, Mark.
I don't have birthdays anymore.
I never thought Mark would
invite me to his party.
(Juliet)
Yeah. (laughs)
And it says right here,
"happy 65th."
(laughs)
(Daymond) Thank you.
There you go,
birthday boy.
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
Oh, look at the cupcake.
(Juliet) All right.
Now who's ready to come play
and party with us?
(Juliet and Lucinda laugh)
(Kevin) Okay, ladies,
let's talk money.
'cause really, that's what
"shark tank" is all about.
Correct.
(Lucinda) Yes.
You say you sell out
on a saturday.
How many parties can you
jam in on a weekend?
'cause I assume
that's when the parties are.
Between six and nine.
How much does it cost?
What are the price ranges?
They range anywhere
from $595 to $4,000.
Depending on--
$600?
For a 2-Hour party.
For 2 hours.
And that supports
how many kids?
15.
That's it?
High-Priced.
But for the--
for the market, actually,
in los Angeles,
we're competitively priced.
What's the average profit
per weekend?
We make $5,000 every weekend,
easily, and some.
How much did you make
last year?
$350,000.
What did you bring
for the bottom line?
Between $125,000 and $150,000.
$150,000.
Is that after paying yourself
or before paying yourself?
After paying ourselves.
We take around $100,000
a year.
Between the two of us.
Between--
(Robert) Wow.
Good for you.
How much does it cost
to open up a single coop...
well...
right from the ground up?
From the ground up,
we got a business loan--
That's how we got our money--
And we had a loan
for $125,000.
And that includes
all the lease--
How much was it?
$125,000.
You built the entire space
for $125,000?
We did a lot of work
ourselves.
We did a lot of it ourselves.
(Mark)
Why not just use the profits
recycle them, and open up
another coop here in L.A.?
it's a big city.
We've talked about that.
I mean, the Manual labor
of actually having
a physical space--
We're open seven days a week,
we're always there.
We're there every day.
(laughs)
So our idea was, like,
with franchises,
maybe we could open 300.
Okay.
(laughs)
Um, so that was kind of
where we were looking at that.
(Kevin) Look, ladies,
on the way
to a successful franchise,
if you look historically
at the ones who have done it--
they take a geographic region
they can actually drive to,
set up 5 to 15 locations,
learn how to manage them,
and then say this model works,
and then do 300 more.
'cause I actually believe
that this could be franchisable.
But you gotta prove it, because
if I was gonna buy it from you,
I'd say,
"you've got one location."
For now...
not an investment,
but, boy, I love your numbers
and I rarely say that
to somebody on "Shark tank."
(laughs) It's True.
We're here because we're...
we need--
Giving you the opportunity
to get in early.
If you give us
what we're asking for,
you're gonna get
your money back
in two years.
I'm out.
(Daymond)
You want $150,000.
Is that all you want?
(Juliet and Lucinda) No.
We want the expertise of
somebody who's a businessperson.
We're creative people.
We're moms.
We don't come from
the business world,
and our business has exploded.
Well, that has to be clear,
because, uh,
you know, we're not here
to exploit people, so...
Well, speak for yourself.
All right.
You would regret
having done the deal with me,
because here, I wouldn't be able
to add any value
and it'd just be money.
And I think that you guys
are rock stars,
and you can open
four or five of 'em,
and have a-a big business
for you guys.
So I would add no value.
I'm out.
All right. Thank you for saying
We're rock stars. (laughs)
(laughs)
You are. You are.
Thank you.
(Robert) I think
the key to the success
of this business
is the two of you guys.
Very successful
at the one location.
Open another one.
I don't understand
why you haven't done that.
You've got the energy
to open 20 of them.
(laughs)
Just go and do it.
Thank you for the shark fin.
I'm out.
Guys, let me
jump in real quick.
First, thank you
for the birthday.
It's the best birthday
I've ever--
Oh, good.
That I've had today.
(laughs)
Two issues. One...
having been through a business
that's very personal
and thinking that I had to have
my stamp on everything
and knowing
how difficult it is
to just grow
those types of businesses,
that's my first concern.
My second concern is,
there are so
many inexpensive alternatives
that the hip, cool, different
I think will work
in the major markets,
but it's gonna be
very, very difficult
to sell to middle America,
even if you reduced
your prices.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Four of the sharks
are out.
Barbara is Lucinda and Juliet's
last chance for a deal.
Lucinda, you said
a few minutes ago to Kevin
that you will get your money
back within two years.
Did you mean that?
I-I do mean that.
Well, then I'll give you
the $150,000 for the 15%.
I don't want anything more,
but I want
your personal guarantee
you'll give me the money back
in two years.
(Kevin) Whoa, shark.
Personal guarantee.
Just to make sure we know
what's going on here--
she's providing you a loan
and she's requiring
as the security
15% equity in the business.
It's called a warrant.
Only a savage
would ask for that.
I do. (laughs)
I--Juliet does.
Do you own a car?
I own a car, yeah.
So if--If your business
doesn't succeed in--
She owns your car.
She owns your car
and your home.
So greedy on this one.
Can we take a minute?
If they're willing to give
15% of their business
just to get a loan,
you know what that tells me?
That banks are not lending
in America.
What entrepreneur doesn't
put his skin on the line?
They want Barbara's expertise.
Barbara can do a lot
with this.
Wait. They're back.
Just before you start, let's
just summarize where we're at.
So...
Barbara very shrewdly has said,
"if you want my money,
"I'll loan it to you
for 24 months,
"and under the condition
that you pay me back,
I'll also take 15%
of The Coop."
Are you willing to accept
that offer?
One quick question.
We will have
your business expertise?
(Barbara) Of course.
I can't help myself.
We are thrilled to be
in business with you, Barbara.
(Mark) All right.
And now--And now
I'll tell you the truth.
You don't need any help.
You're geniuses.
Aww. Thank you.
I feel so good,
I should hug somebody.
Thanks, Barbara.
I'm so happy.
(Barbara) Oh, Robert,
you look so adorable.
Let me take a picture.
Got it.
Can you send it to me?
My kids are gonna love it.
No problem. I have t-Mobile
super-Fast network.
Done.
Barbara is warm,
but you can tell
that sh--Barbara has
some real savvy.
You know, she's gonna
kick us up a notch.
