Hello.
My name is Donna Mccue.
Take your time,
and you can just enjoy.
Thank you, Donna.
You're welcome.
Thank you, Donna.
(Robert) Donna,
which is the best one?
Well, you know what I love
the best is the vanilla.
But that's my preference.
Smooth.
Whoa.
(Barbara) Deliciously smooth.
(Donna) This chocolate--
(Barbara) mmm.
I'll tell you why
it's so good.
Years ago,
I always wanted to be
in show business,
Dougie, Donna, Dana, Debbie,
Dennis, Daryl, Danny,
Donna, I gotta know--
Mary-Katherine?
Why not a "D"?
my mother prayed
to the virgin Mary
that she wouldn't have
any more kids,
Donna, you're scaring me.
You're scaring me.
(both laughing)
Give us your numbers.
Okay.
I have a deal
with whole foods. Ta-Da!
Let me just tell you
what's happening.
(Robert) But do you have sales
in the last 12 months?
Yes!
What are they?
(laughs)
What are they?
It's so exciting. Okay.
(Kevin) Donna.
Yes.
What are the sales
in the last 12 months?
How many dollars?
Okay.
$60,000.
$60,000?
I'm not as excited
as you were.
What?
(Barbara) Oh, my God.
That's not good?
No! Donna.
Oh, my god.
Donna, whatever you're on,
don't give it to Kevin.
That's not good? Listen,
I'm just one person.
(Robert) That's so low.
Huh?
That's so low.
No, listen--
listen to this--
The name alone
is worth a million.
Oh, can I just tell you
another really exciting thing?
Now imagine me--
I'm in a farmers' market.
This is where I started.
All these people come out,
? Hee-Hee-Whoo ?
(Kevin) Here's the problem,
Donna.
(laughs)
'cause, you know, in the end,
the reality is about money,
okay?
I know.
We're dealing with $60,000
in sales.
I believe that probably
you're breaking even on that.
Aren't we supposed to
negotiate, babe?
Well, here's what--we'll start
the negotiation this way--
I'll give you $250,000...
for 1,000%
of fat ass Fudge.
I'm--1,000%?
But isn't that too much?
1,000%?
(Robert) Oh, my god.
Exactly my point.
It's 1,000%.
It's, like, you know--
You need somebody that says,
"listen, Donna,
Please, Donna.
(laughs)
Donna, you're a sweetheart.
Yeah!
(Barbara) Donna,
do you mind if I give you
some honest feedback?
Yes.
Okay.
You know what I see
in front of me?
A wildly enthusiastic lady
who likes to make Fudge.
I don't think this has a thing
to do with money.
Donna, I think--I think--
You--You--You--
I'm out.
(Kevin) Okay, mark.
Bring it in.
Donna, I don't think
you need me.
I think you're gonna be
just fine on your own.
So I'm out.
Okay. It was fun.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
