Hi, I'm Jillian Jaccard,
and this is Connor Pastoor,
and we're the owners
of the partie Poche group.
We are seeking
a $100,000 investment
for a 20% equity stake
in our company.
We're both students
a loyola marymount University,
where I'm pursuing
a double major
in accounting and finance,
and Connor is getting
his M.B.A.
When I used to live with
a bunch of sorority girls,
I witnessed firsthand
a female phenomena
of our generation.
When going out
for a night on the town,
it's commonplace for girls
to stuff their phone,
cards, I.D.
Into their bras...
Really?
To avoid the hassle
of carrying a purse.
Yes, really.
Stop the madness.
Our product is partie Poche,
a novel nightlife
fashion accessory
that conveniently replaces
a handbag or clutch
by carrying a woman's essentials
around her leg.
No one wants to lug around
a bulky handbag
when the whole purpose
of going out is to dance,
be carefree, and have fun.
And not only
does it look adorable,
but it's so comfortable that
I forget I'm wearing it.
As part of this target market,
I can assure that Partie Poche
will sell.
So remember, when you party,
partie Poche.
Jillian, you say "Will sell."
Have you sold anything?
Yes, we sold 200
on our web site.
And then all of a sudden,
we were shipping these things
to maine, to Vermont,
to Virginia...
But if people didn't
know your name...
all over.
How did they find
your website?
Because people are actively
looking for a way
to solve this problem.
How much does each unit
sell for?
The majority of those units
sold for $17.
But we started bumping up
between $17
all the way to $39
toward the end of the 200,
and we ended up selling
about 27 of them
at the $39 price point.
And is there anything
proprietary about this?
Do you have a patent?
We do have
a provisional patent.
You're telling me,
for $100,000 I get 20%.
(Connor) correct.
And because
you're smart M.B.A.S
and accounting people,
what are you saying your
business is worth right now?
So we're gonna
steer you clear--
What is it?
Give me the number.
Let me--Let me--
Let me preface that--
professor O'Leary
wants to know the answer.
Let me--Let me try and steer you
clear of a valuation--
Are you groveling and begging
'cause you know the answer
is crazy?
We want--He wants to know--
okay. Connor, can I take it?
What's crazy is to try
to value a company
that is pre-Revenue.
(Connor) it makes no sense. We
could do discounted Cash flow--
Well done.
Point well done.
Let me value it.
You know what?
But the problem is that--Is--
(Jillian) But I can talk
discounted cash flows
and intangible assets
right now.
One second. One second.
(Kevin) 'cause you know--
Jillian, you know...
bring it on. Let's do it.
You're gonna sell exactly
how many in 12 months?
You don't know.
Yes. Well,
I don't know exactly.
(laughs)
How much are you saying
your company is worth?
Okay, 200--If we sell 200,000
units in the first year--
No, wait.
No, no, no. You asked for--
the question is, when you
impute a value on the company--
I give you $100,000,
you give me 20% of the stock--
What are you telling me
your company's worth today?
I based 2 valuation methods
off of 200,000 units of sales
or 100,000 units of sales
in the first year.
That brought us to
a $4.3-Million valuation
and then
a $1.9-Million valuation.
You still haven't given us
the answer.
There is a number that you have
valuated your company at--
$500,000 is what--
there you go.
That's all.
But--but that's not what
I'm valuing it at
because I realized
that's it not just the cash.
But if you can make
a value 500--
the cash is just an asset--
Okay, you know what?
You wasted Everybody's time.
'cause they had--they don't--
They're not creative
to think about anything else
and they have no ability
to increase the value.
Why isn't it--
So this is the deal--
Well, I bet you she'll be
real accurate about my money
when it comes over there,
right?
Tell us--
She'll have an accurate
valuation of that, wouldn't she?
Tell us about how much
it costs to make these
and how low you think
you can get your cost,
um, based off of,
um, volume.
(Connor) So recently we
partnered with a manufacturer
and, uh, she quoted us
at $4, said and done.
We have the infrastructure
to support the 200,000 units
that I said we can sell.
And I can break--
If we cut it in--
Down into 100,000 units
for one year,
that's $1.9-Million
valuation.
I can--I can break out--
I'm in this space.
It sounds really good,
what you're saying.
Thank you.
It's worth nothing.
Well, we ha--
Not yet. It can't
be worth anything,
which is why we don't try
to valuate in front of it.
But you're asking--
You just said "Not yet.
It can't be worth anything,"
but you want
a half-a-million-Dollars
valuation on our company.
I had a meeting with the vice
president of sales and marketing
at Nordstrom
up in seattle about--
and what did they say?
Loved the concept.
But you need a buyer? Did they
put you in touch with a buyer?
No. He said, "I don't want to
put you in touch with a buyer
until you have
the final product."
(Daymond) right.
But you have put
a half-a-million-Dollar
valuation on
basically a piece of hosiery
with a bag.
Daymond, are you--
maybe it's
the best thing ever...
are you saying that
everything comes back
to one thing in life--
Money?
Yes.
Okay, then let me take it
from here.
You're insane.
(Connor laughs)
This is not worth $500,000.
Under no scenario would I ever
give you $100,000 for only 20%.
$100,000 is what
the whole thing is worth, maybe.
I'm stuck.
I'm choking on it, you know?
Let me address that.
There's nothing
you can say.
If we--
there's not a word--
Another word you could say
that would ever, ever, ever
convince me this--
What about "money"?
we have 50 grand cash
in our account.
(laughs)
Where did you get
the 50 grand?
We had
two people approach us.
Their buy-In, their capital
contribution was 50 grand.
At that time, we didn't
even have a product.
It was an idea.
You still don't.
We do. That--
That will sell.
This one on my leg
will sell on a web site.
So what did you--
Will sell.
How much of the company
did you sell them for $50,000?
40%.
Jillian and I
are 60% stakeholders.
They got 40% for $50,000?
We had nothing
at that point.
Oh, my goodness.
We didn't have a distributor.
We didn't have a designer.
(laughs)
We didn't have p.O.S
hanging in front of us.
Do you see my dilemma?
You still
don't have a p.O.
Wait, wait. But, Kevin...
we have p.O.S
hanging in front of us.
They're--
they are also working.
They're managing partners--
You come in here
with this story...
they work 60 hours a week.
And you charge me
ten times more?
Are you crazy?
No, I'm not crazy...
Well, it's not ten times.
Because that's what
the company's worth.
Guys, you guys
just don't get it.
You don't have a--you have P.O.S
that you can show us?
No, we don't have P.O.S
no, I'm saying.
I have a--one waiting.
I mean, 24,000 units--
You have one waiting.
Oh, I got it.
I just didn't have
a product to give to her.
(sharks laughing)
(Connor) Look, Kevin,
if you were willing to work
and slave on this product--
(Kevin) Connor...
you can have the exact
same rate they got.
Critical mistake
if you think I would ever pay
10 times more than some college
guy got it for 30 days ago.
Are you out of your minds?
Okay, it's five times.
Five times more.
Only five times?
Oh, that's much more exciting.
Well, no, let's talk about what
they brought to the company
because that's worth a lot.
Sure. Cash, right?
They brought cash...
Cash--
But they also--
they brought a designer,
a supplier in are area that
can produce any quantity,
literally any quantity,
up to a million units
within a year.
By the way--
That's invaluable,
to find a supply chain
that is well-Oiled.
All right, look, look--
That is not invaluable.
That's everybody.
I-I--
to find a supply chain
that is well-Oiled?
That's everybody.
That's out there.
I am very, very worried--
That's everybody.
That's something we didn't have
before we had them.
What do you think
factories exist for?
(Barbara) Talk.
(Kevin) listen, I'm very worried
for both of you
because what happens
if you come in here
with a crazy valuation--
Sometimes a lightning Bolt
comes from the ceiling
and Fries you.
And I think that's happening
right now.
I am out.
Gone. Out.
And I forbid any of these sharks
to get involved with you.
Wow. Well, let me, uh,
double back
and start talking about
the demand again,
because I-I know
it will sell.
I'm standing here,
and that $500,000 valuation,
Kevin, it kills me.
Next week I can sign
a $124,000 purchase order.
Next week.
Is that--Is that right?
You think that, right?
And I'm gonna give away
20% of my company
for a $100,000 to you?
You have such a thick skull
that you're not listening to us.
Mm-hmm.
You're not getting
what we're saying to you.
I have about
ten apparel companies,
and I can't get
a $125,000 opening order
on a new product line.
It just doesn't happen.
What if your board member
works directly with...
Who cares where
your board member works?
That doesn't--
who cares?
The way stores Work is...
who cares who your--
they give you a small order,
they test you.
Then they come back.
Then they come back.
Everything you've said here
is incorrect.
It's just theory.
(Robert) You know,
the success in business
is by going out
and actually selling stuff.
I find it so arrogant
of you to--
to be so flippant about
your ability to get orders
when you don't have
any orders.
You've done everything
except get dirty.
(Connor) I completely
appreciate that.
And believe me when I tell you
that I am willing
to get out there,
to put in the 80-Hour weeks,
and to slave
to make this thing happen.
And that's going back to what
that $500,000 valuation is,
is you're buying us.
You're buying our time,
our emotion, and our passion
to make this thing happen.
It doesn't matter
who you know.
It doesn't matter
what connections you have.
None of that crap matters when
you get out in the real world.
Go out, get dirty,
get some sales.
I'm out.
You came in here
with no orders, 200 sold,
and you said, "It's worth
a half a million dollars."
I know. We gave you guys a deal.
I'm 100% aware of that.
(Robert and Daymond laugh)
(Kevin) I believe him.
All right. Go ahead.
He gave us a deal.
I'm--I'm thinking Bambi
about to meet godzilla.
I mean,
that's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna walk out
of the shark tank
into the real world,
and it is going to
eat you alive.
You don't know me, Kevin.
You're gonna be kicking--
You're gonna be
kicking yourselves...
alive.
That you didn't get in
with us.
Oh, my goodness.
Kevin, you don't know me.
(Kevin groans)
You don't know
how I can fight, Kevin.
(Barbara) I don't think
This is gonna sell, honestly.
And you know what?
Your wild-Eyed enthusiasm
makes you blind.
Every time a shark went out
here, you just kept talking.
That is amazing to me.
I think you really have to go
into the Real world--
Test this thing--
Before you ever involve
other investors.
Barbara, let me clarify
for the rest of the sharks--
See? You didn't
even take a breath there.
"Barbara, let me clarify."
I don't feel listened to.
I'm so out on this.
Uh, I put
my whole savings
into this company.
The saying is, you know,
life is a cruel teacher.
She loves to give you
the test first
and the lesson later.
And you'll learn
sooner or later. I'm out.
Hey, Mark.
So A.E.G.,
100,000-Plus attendees,
100,000--
Shh.
Calm down.
Ignore everything
they just said.
They're 100% wrong.
(chuckles)
Four sharks are out.
Shh.
And Mark Cuban
is Jillian and Connor's
last chance at getting a deal.
Just calm down.
Ignore everything
they just said.
They're 100% wrong.
You guys remind me of me
when I was 21.
You're trying to win
every battle.
That's what being competitive
is all about.
Now I tried
to ask the questions
that would educate me about
where you're going strategically
and could I add value.
(chuckles)
Tell me about
your infrastructure.
Really quick.
(snaps fingers)
Ten seconds or less.
What--what do you have?
So we have a design,
so we can design New products
in different colors,
different sizes.
Great. So you have someone
who can make 'em and build 'em?
Yeah.
Okay.
And the 200 you sold at
your web site was how long ago?
It was six months ago.
Okay, why have you not continued
to sell them on your web site?
Because we ran out.
(laughs)
Okay, so you have $50,000
in the bank.
Why didn't you use that money
to fulfill the orders?
Because we--we couldn't
make any more of those.
That was with a small designer
who did freelance work
with a supply chain that
Connor put together...
(laughs) That was amazing
for his first whack at it.
Okay. Shh.
Don't go on a tangent.
Okay?
So you have $50,000
in the bank,
and you've gone six months
without selling anything?
We just secured that
a month ago.
Okay, in your model,
in your business plan,
you've gone from nothing,
basically,
to 200,000 units.
Mm-hmm.
What got you from nothing
to 200,000 units?
What percentage was on-Line,
what percentage was
going to have to be retail?
15% was retail
through the web site.
85% was--
Okay, you mean on-Line.
85% was wholesale.
Or we can change up
that ratio.
It could be one of those
internet on-Line sensations--
50/50.
See? But now you're waffling.
What you just told me is,
you don't really know
what you're going to do.
I know who I'm gonna
sell it to...
I mean, what--
in the next--
I know those 100,000 units.
I know. I--look, I get--
I get
that you believe in it.
I was hoping I could prove
these fools wrong.
And you didn't.
No, unfortunately not.
If you would've come back
to me
and said, "'a,' this is
what I'm gonna do--
'a,' 'b,' 'c,' 'd,'--
to get to 200,000 units"
and it made
crystal-Clear sense to me,
the hun--Then the $100,000
is nothing.
So for that reason, I'm out.
Can I stop you there
and try again?
No, I'm out.
Well, we do have a plan,
and that--Our last one
was the meeting
that we had last week,
so that's the first one.
We have--We--
Jillian, Jill...
good luck.
Go get 'em, guys.
All right.
Thank you, guys.
