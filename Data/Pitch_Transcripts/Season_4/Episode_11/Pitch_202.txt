Hello.
My name is Donna Mccue.
And I'm the president
and founder
of fat ass Fudge.
I'm asking for $250,000
for 5% of my company.
Wow.
(mark laughs)
What is fat ass Fudge,
you ask?
It's my grandmother's recipe
that I took up
a hundred notches.
It's made with goat milk.
It's lactose free, gluten free.
But it's not glutton free.
(laughs)
(laughs) Oh, oh.
That always makes me laugh.
Chocolate--
It makes people happy.
So instead of
talking about it,
I want to give you
a little taste
before we get the questions.
You could take one.
Take your time,
and you can just enjoy.
Thank you, Donna.
You're welcome.
Thank you, Donna.
(Robert) Donna,
which is the best one?
Well, you know what I love
the best is the vanilla.
But that's my preference.
Smooth.
Whoa.
(Barbara) Deliciously smooth.
(Donna) This chocolate--
(Barbara) mmm.
I'll tell you why
it's so good.
Years ago,
I always wanted to be
in show business,
and every time I didn't get
a part or something,
instead of beat myself up,
I would beat that chocolate.
So I got really good
at making chocolate--
years of not getting things
that I wanted.
It was at my 60th birthday,
my whole family--
Dougie, Donna, Dana, Debbie,
Dennis, Daryl, Danny,
and Mary-Katherine--
We all came to my party,
plus all my friends...
(laughs)
I gave them little goodie bags
because This is a special treat.
Donna, I gotta know--
Mary-Katherine?
Why not a "D"?
my mother prayed
to the virgin Mary
that she wouldn't have
any more kids,
and if she didn't have
any more kids,
she'd name it after her.
(laughs)
So my older brother said to me
when he had that Fudge,
he said,
"you should sell it."
And he said,
"what would you call it?"
and I said,
"I'll call it
"what you
used to call me growing up--
Fat ass."
And that--That idea
never left my mind.
I saw it. I got, like, chills.
I knew that
this would be a hit.
I had a dream about you
last night.
I'll have to tell you.
(Robert) WHOA!
(Barbara) Whoa, baby.
(laughs)
No, I do. (laughs)
I do. I do. I see it.
Donna, you're scaring me.
You're scaring me.
(both laughing)
Give us your numbers.
Okay.
I have a deal
with whole foods. Ta-Da!
Let me just tell you
what's happening.
(Robert) But do you have sales
in the last 12 months?
Yes!
What are they?
(laughs)
What are they?
It's so exciting. Okay.
(Kevin) Donna.
Yes.
What are the sales
in the last 12 months?
How many dollars?
Okay.
$60,000.
$60,000?
I'm not as excited
as you were.
What?
(Barbara) Oh, my God.
That's not good?
No! Donna.
Oh, my god.
Donna, whatever you're on,
don't give it to Kevin.
That's not good? Listen,
I'm just one person.
(Robert) That's so low.
Huh?
That's so low.
No, listen--
listen to this--
The name alone
is worth a million.
Oh, can I just tell you
another really exciting thing?
Now imagine me--
I'm in a farmers' market.
This is where I started.
All these people come out,
and they wipe me out
of all my product,
like in a wind whirl.
The name brings them to me,
But the taste keeps people
coming back.
(Barbara) Ah.
This is a brand.
This has
endless possibilities.
First off, I think
you're a great actress.
Oh, thank you.
But what do you do?
You're going from farmers'
market to farmers' market
and selling your product
by yourself?
Yes, and then
the second part of it--
now that I'm in whole foods,
they're putting in orders,
and there's another--
(Kevin)
When you say whole foods,
you have one store
you're selling to?
I have two stores.
Do you have a purchase order?
Yes! Oh. (laughs)
For two stores?
Can I say "Yes!"?
(laughs)
(Barbara chuckles)
? Hee-Hee-Whoo ?
(Kevin) Here's the problem,
Donna.
(laughs)
'cause, you know, in the end,
the reality is about money,
okay?
I know.
We're dealing with $60,000
in sales.
I believe that probably
you're breaking even on that.
Aren't we supposed to
negotiate, babe?
Well, here's what--we'll start
the negotiation this way--
I'll give you $250,000...
for 1,000%
of fat ass Fudge.
I'm--1,000%?
But isn't that too much?
1,000%?
(Robert) Oh, my god.
Exactly my point.
It's 1,000%.
It's, like, you know--
How--How long have you
and Barbara been friends?
(sharks laugh)
You don't think that I have
something special, honestly?
I feel I can bring sweetness
and happiness to people
and also I feel
I deserve my own tv show.
(sharks laugh)
(Robert) You gotta be
kidding me.
(Kevin) You're interesting.
The product is good.
So that's what we have.
And that's all you--
stirring it up in the kitchen,
packaging it, and selling it.
If you want to make this
a big business,
one that's worth
$5 million one day,
you need a partner,
because you're nuts.
In a nice way, I'm saying it.
You need a partner.
You need somebody that says,
"listen, Donna,
"you make the Fudge,
and I'm going to figure out
how to make this
much bigger."
That's what's missing
in your presentation.
'cause every once in a while,
lightning strikes
and somebody
dreams up a cookie
or a piece of Fudge
with a crazy name,
and they become rich.
You're half-Baked right now.
You're not fully cooked.
You need the other piece.
You didn't bring it with you,
so unfortunately,
Mr. Wonderful has to say...
I'm out.
Kevin, can I say to you...
Please, Donna.
The difference between
you and chocolate--
Want me to tell you?
Please.
Chocolate doesn't disappoint.
(laughs)
Donna, you're a sweetheart.
Yeah!
I love you,
and I love your Fudge.
I think I found
your other partner.
She's just as crazy as you.
(laughs)
I'm introducing you
to skinny-Ass Barbara.
(Barbara) Donna,
do you mind if I give you
some honest feedback?
Yes.
Okay.
You know what I see
in front of me?
A wildly enthusiastic lady
who likes to make Fudge.
I don't think this has a thing
to do with money.
I think all you want to do is
get out there and meet people,
get attention, share your
enthusiasm for your product,
and that's
what you're doing already.
There's no room in this deal
for any kind of a partner.
Why don't you just keep doing
what you're doing?
I'm out.
I don't know if anybody else
said it--the stuff is great.
Thank you very much.
Uh, and I could sit here
and watch you all day because...
definitely. A good show.
I enjoy your energy.
But, um...
This is not a business for me
so I'm out.
Donna, I think--I think--
You--You--You--
I'm out.
(Kevin) Okay, mark.
Bring it in.
Donna, I don't think
you need me.
I think you're gonna be
just fine on your own.
So I'm out.
Okay. It was fun.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
