I was shocked. We had car loans,
we had a huge mortgage.
It was worth hundreds
of millions of dollars,
My name is Megan Gage,
(Mark) Megan, tell us
about the business.
Okay, absolutely.
Um, we've been in business
for about 15 months.
We started
in children's boutiques.
That was originally my goal
for the line.
Um, but we've learned
that salons
So, Megan, what--
What were your sales
in the last 15 months?
We've made about $20,000.
Um, but in
the past 12 days,
I've got $7,000
in purchase orders.
What happened
in the last seven days?
(Mark) Megan,
I have a 3-year-Old son.
I know you do.
Jake.
Way to take it to him, Megan.
That's not the hair.
(mark laughs)
You're talking about
all the products--
That's okay.
What about
the baby hair products?
Well, there's not
a lot of numbers on that,
'cause it's new.
I mean, it's just
kind of getting started.
But with $20,000 in sales,
why do you feel it could be
something huge?
Uh, because people
get excited about it.
They say, "Hey,
that's a good idea.
Why didn't I think of that?"
I've had two calls
in the past two weeks
from distributors
in dubai.
In dubai?
(Lori) in dubai.
It's amazing.
We've been featured
by over a hundred
different media sources,
from, you know, mom blogs
to beauty blogs to magazines.
You know, I--
So why haven't you
sold more, though?
I mean, so you see--See why
we're seeing a disconnect here?
Something's not adding up.
I tell you, all the work
you've done,
the way you present yourself,
your vision for the product--
That's all on the good side.
Where I really have
a problem is $20,000.
It's speaking to me, saying,
"nobody cares."
You know, I did
my first trade show,
So, Megan, you've created
maybe a new category.
But $20,000 of sales
in the hair care product
Industry is absolutely nothing.
It's not even a rounding error.
It's mist.
I can't get over the Hurdle
of whether This is
a business or not.
(Mark) Megan,
I'll make it simple. I like it.
Thanks, Megan.
Thank you guys so much.
I really appreciate it.
Fantastic presentation.
(Daymond) Good luck.
Good luck.
Thank you, guys.
(Robert) Fantastic.
(Kevin) That's interesting.
I mean, either she's got
a category killer,
or there isn't a category.
That's okay. My kids will use
all the lotion that's left then.
(laughter)
This means everything.
It means that
I can make a product...
