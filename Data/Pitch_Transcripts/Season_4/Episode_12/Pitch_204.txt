I was shocked. We had car loans,
we had a huge mortgage.
It was worth hundreds
of millions of dollars,
and I hung on to it.
It was the best decision
I ever made.
What are you going to do?
I would like to, uh,
talk to my family about it.
Okay.
Mark, partnered with Lori,
has offered us,
uh, a million dollars...
(laughs)
In order... (laughs)
You're taking a guy's company
underneath him.
Also, Kevin has offered us
$150,000,
and then would, uh,
bank us on the other $300,000.
(Mark) We sit here
all the time and talk about
how unfortunate
and how tough things are
in this country right now,
and here we are
giving the guy a million dollars--
You're stealing
his American dream.
He's not gonna sell his soul.
You know,
getting this started
has been a huge sacrifice
for us.
Okay.
Okay, Bye.
(kisses)
Love you.
All right. (laughs)
(exhales deeply) Sorry.
(Kevin) What are you gonna do?
All right. Um...
I really think
it's too early in the game
for us
with the Game Face company
to give up 100%
of the company.
Ooh.
But I do like
Lori and Mark working with us.
We could go with the $450,000
and $80,000 in salary,
and we would give out...
35% equity in the company.
So, I would like
to counter back, Mark.
$450,000 at the 40%
that I started with,
and he can get
the $80,000 salary
for the first three years.
I would do
as Lori suggested,
or $450K for 35%
plus the $80k guaranteed
for 3 years,
but a 10% royalty
till we get our money back.
I'm good with that.
(Kevin) It just shows you
my deal is
the right one anyways.
They're just copying my deal.
So it's just a question of how
you value the 5% in equity,
and I'll leave that
up to you.
My name's Megan Gage,
and I live
just outside
of Denver, Colorado,
with my family,
and they're everything to me.
Whee! (laughs)
My son Christian is 3.
He's a boy.
He likes dirt and trucks
and tools,
but he always looks handsome.
(laughs)
Look at mommy!
(giggles)
Moms want the best
for their kids,
and a lot of the time,
the things on the market
are not the best, and I wanted
to create something
that could really
give my son some style.
Hi. How are you?
Here's 40 more.
Okay.
I grew up
in a really small town.
My dad was a coal Miner,
and most people
in the town were.
It taught the value
of hard work, and I think that
that was something
that I'll always carry with me.
We can get
that right out to you guys.
I entered into an industry
where I knew nothing
about nothing.
It feels really impossible
to get noticed.
My family worked hard
for the money we put in this.
Getting an investment
from the sharks
would give me that partner
I need
so that I could sleep better
at night,
knowing that things are
gonna be okay
and that I didn't lose
our money.
My name is Megan Gage,
and I'm the creator
of hot tot
children's hair care.
I'm seeking
a $50,000 investment
in exchange for a 15%
equity stake in my business.
Hot tot produces
professional hair products
for babies and children
without the use
of harsh or harmful chemicals.
Moms take great pride
in having our little ones
Look adorable
from head to toe.
I have always liked for
Christian to have stylish hair.
(spritzing)
This is just water, guys.
(Robert laughs)
I gotta get it going
in the right direction.
(laughs)
But the fruity-Scented
children's lines
with cartoonish-Looking labels
didn't appeal to me at all.
Traditional formulas leave
a residue in his hair
that was pretty difficult
to remove
and also didn't smell
very good or work very well.
(sharks laughing)
Punk it up.
That's right!
(laughter)
You may be surprised to know
that many trusted
children's brands
commonly use a long list
of unsafe ingredients
in their formulas--
Things like formaldehyde
which are not even required
to be listed on a label.
I'm a mom with a conscience
who won't cut corners
when it comes to kiddos.
You're doing so good.
And my products can easily
be assimilated
into any upscale salon
throughout the world.
I just need your help
in getting them on the shelves.
Please help me in turning
cool kids across the world
into hot tots.
Is that your son?
It is, yes.
This is my little guy.
(Daymond) Adorable.
(Robert) What's his name?
His name is Christian.
Can you wave at everybody?
Great job, Christian.
How old is he?
(Lori) He's so cute.
He just turned 3.
(Robert) oh!
Oh!
(Mark) Megan, tell us
about the business.
Okay, absolutely.
Um, we've been in business
for about 15 months.
We started
in children's boutiques.
That was originally my goal
for the line.
Um, but we've learned
that salons
are really
our bread and butter.
And Christian's gotta go,
guys. I'm so sorry.
Bye, Christian.
See you, Christian.
Later, Chris.
Can you wave good-Bye
to the sharks?
(Robert) See ya.
Oh!
So, Megan, what--
What were your sales
in the last 15 months?
We've made about $20,000.
Um, but in
the past 12 days,
I've got $7,000
in purchase orders.
What happened
in the last seven days?
I met a very nice lady,
and she gave me some contacts
with some of
the children's flash sites,
where they'll do like
a 24-Hour promotion
on your brand.
And everyone I reached out to,
um, was interested.
This was never my dream.
If you would have asked me
four years ago,
I would have said
This was a crazy idea.
May still be.
It's--It's not, uncle Kevin.
Uncle Kevin! (laughs)
Please, call me "Mr. Wonderful."
Absolutely.
So this is a styling aid.
It's good for boys and girls,
for people who are concerned
about using
a hair product
on their baby.
Oh, it smells good.
My professional background
is in clinical social work.
I have a master's degree
in social work.
(Robert) So you're not
a hair stylist?
I'm not.
The packaging, to me,
looks like
something
that would be for an adult.
I mean, it's very pretty, but it
doesn't say to me "children."
I think it needs to say
that it's for children
and that it's healthier,
that it has
those safer elements to it.
Are you opposed to changing
your packaging?
Um, I don't think I would be
interested in changing it.
Here's why.
You know, we're not the only
children's line on the market.
You're not.
I know that.
Right.
But the other ones all had,
like, cartoon-Looking
animals and children,
and they smelled like fruit.
Are they safer, too? Do they--
No.
They're not? So there is
a distinct difference...
absolutely.
Between yours and theirs?
(Mark) Megan,
I have a 3-year-Old son.
I know you do.
Jake.
And jakers has got eczema.
Yep.
And who knows
what other allergies he has?
So what type
of allergy testing
have you done
with these products?
Absolutely. My manufacturer
does a lot of, um,
like, stability testing
and micro testing
and things like that.
(Kevin) But do you have
the market size
for children's products
like this,
including
all your competitors?
'cause that's what
I'm struggling with.
How big a market is this?
Well, there are 280,000
salons in America alone.
The global baby care
market
Does $48 billion a year
and is expected to grow
by 5% in the next 5 years.
She's killing you, Kevin!
Way to take it to him, Megan.
That's not the hair.
(mark laughs)
You're talking about
all the products--
That's okay.
What about
the baby hair products?
Well, there's not
a lot of numbers on that,
'cause it's new.
I mean, it's just
kind of getting started.
But with $20,000 in sales,
why do you feel it could be
something huge?
Uh, because people
get excited about it.
They say, "Hey,
that's a good idea.
Why didn't I think of that?"
I've had two calls
in the past two weeks
from distributors
in dubai.
In dubai?
(Lori) in dubai.
It's amazing.
We've been featured
by over a hundred
different media sources,
from, you know, mom blogs
to beauty blogs to magazines.
You know, I--
So why haven't you
sold more, though?
I mean, so you see--See why
we're seeing a disconnect here?
Something's not adding up.
I tell you, all the work
you've done,
the way you present yourself,
your vision for the product--
That's all on the good side.
Where I really have
a problem is $20,000.
It's speaking to me, saying,
"nobody cares."
You know, I did
my first trade show,
and I sat in Dallas,
and they said, "prepare,
"because they're gonna
eat you for breakfast.
They are not gonna be
receptive to this."
And I thought, okay.
But, like, I drug my family
across the country,
and I'm not gonna make
a dime?
And we were there,
and we sold $1,000 in 2 days.
Which is nothing to you guys.
I know that.
Um, but it was something
to me.
I love every $1,000 equally.
Have those folks reordered?
They have.
My average wholesale markup
is 142%,
and my average retail markup
is 284%.
Um, as we make
more product...
great markup.
Great markup.
We can get better margins.
I have one--
(Lori) That's a great markup.
Get better margins that that?
We can. Absolutely.
Yeah. That's...
um, because my costs
to make these
have come down considerably,
um, since we got started,
because I'm learning things.
So, Megan, you've created
maybe a new category.
But $20,000 of sales
in the hair care product
Industry is absolutely nothing.
It's not even a rounding error.
It's mist.
I can't get over the Hurdle
of whether This is
a business or not.
I just don't know,
and neither do you.
So for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
But I do know it's a business.
I just wanted
to clarify that.
I took a lot of heat
in the beginning
because people would say,
"you're not a hair stylist.
You're a social worker."
And then I had the epiphany
that these products
are not for hair stylists.
Moms are gonna be the ones
to buy these products.
And when it's important,
moms will listen.
You know, I didn't do so well
in chemistry in college.
I would be honest,
but when I learned about
the toxins
in children's products
and their effects
on a growing body,
I learned--
Moms can figure this out.
Then don't--don't you think
we have to take it further
and actually test and label that
we've tested for these things?
Because--
Absolutely, But those kind of
studies are very expensive.
H-Have you priced them out
to know how much?
I know an optical test
costs about $10,000.
And if you look at my labeling,
we do not
use the term "Tear-Free."
I cannot afford
to use that term right now.
I-I think
it needs to be branded
a little bit more
towards children. Um...
sure.
My heart is with you,
but my gut right now is,
I feel there's a lot of work
to be done.
Sure.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
(Mark) Megan,
I'll make it simple. I like it.
And obviously, I have
a personal connection.
I think $50,000
is not enough.
And for me, the testing
is the most important,
because if I can invest
in a product
that makes my kid's life
a little bit better
and opens a new market
and has a chance to be
successful, that's a no-Brainer.
So I want to make you
an offer.
I want to offer you $75,000
for 40% of the company.
You know, we'll help you
get out there into salons.
We'll help you get
into the kids' market.
Sure.
So if that's something
you'd be interested in,
I'd like to partner with you.
Oh, my goodness, mark.
You know, I--
out of respect
for everybody else,
I'd like to hear what
anyone else has to say.
No disrespect.
No disrespect taken.
(Robert)
Wow, what a great answer.
Megan, I'm sitting here
and--and I'm thinking,
is it brilliant?
Have you created
a brand-New category
in hair salons?
Or... is it gonna be
a really, really tough road?
I don't know.
I think mark's made you
a fantastic offer.
Frankly, better than I--
I would have made.
Uh... I'm out.
So, a friend of mine
is Paul Mitchell.
Mm-Hmm.
But I have to be honest.
I think, uh, cuban is ready
to take the ride with you
all the way.
I wouldn't be
of any help to you
if that one person I know
says, "beat it," all right?
So I guess I'm out.
Okay. Mark, I would love
to work with you.
(Kevin) Well, wait a sec.
Wait a sec.
Wait--I was--
there's no waiting.
Wait a second.
That's it.
Shake her hand.
Thank you, mark.
Wow.
I'm so excited.
Thanks, Megan.
Thank you guys so much.
I really appreciate it.
Fantastic presentation.
(Daymond) Good luck.
Good luck.
Thank you, guys.
(Robert) Fantastic.
(Kevin) That's interesting.
I mean, either she's got
a category killer,
or there isn't a category.
That's okay. My kids will use
all the lotion that's left then.
(laughter)
This means everything.
It means that
I can make a product...
(voice breaking)
and it's not gonna take
the last 10 cents
out of my bank account.
Like, it's amazing. (crying)
(whispers) It's amazing.
