First into the shark tank
is Doug Marshall
with the next generation
of face painting.
(chuckles)
Hello, sharks.
My name is Doug Marshall,
Thank you, Doug.
Lori, this is
an exotic mask face.
(laughing)
This skeleton face
May do just
the right thing for you.
(Robert) Oh, that's so
perfect for you, Kevin.
I like that.
That is perfect.
(Lori) so it's
a one-time use, Doug?
Yes.
But it's Peel off,
as opposed to wash off?
Right.
(Robert) It's incredible.
(Robert) But--But, Doug,
that can't be true.
I've bought stickers--
the key is full face.
The key is full face.
Full face.
Full face.
What's your full-time job,
Doug?
I work for xerox
selling copiers.
You've got these big margins.
It's working for you.
Yeah.
Why still sell copiers
instead of do this full-time?
Well, we've got two kids.
We got--
We got into
the real estate bust
in east texas.
Okay, so you gotta
pay the bills, basically.
I gotta pay the bills.
What's the $450,000 for?
$300,000 would get me
on a salary
for the next three years,
get us going
with the licenses.
We want to get nba.
(Daymond) one second,
one second. Doug.
You just basically said,
"I want $100,000 a year
for 3 years."
I think that's absurd.
I-I didn't make any money
from my business for nine years.
I'm out.
Doug, I-I really like
the product.
But I gotta tell you,
when you said,
"I'm gonna take a $100,000
salary for the next 3 years,
(Mark) What are you gonna
use the money for, Doug?
(Kevin) Doug, let me solve
that problem for you right now.
Here's a deal for you.
I'll give you $450,000.
Here's how I'll do it.
I'll give you $150,000
of it
for 30% of your company.
The other $300,000
you've asked for,
I'll give to you as a loan.
Doug has two offers
on the table--
$450,000 for a 30% stake
Doug, I saw your soul
drift out of the shark tank.
(mark laughs)
There it goes.
(Lori laughs)
It could've been worth
$15 million, but no.
That's exactly
what's happening.
(laughing)
So, my offer makes
a lot more sense.
I leave 70% of the upside
to you.
It's perfect.
So, Doug, when I started
my business,
a guy came along,
offered me $5 million.
It was more money
than I had ever dreamed of.
(Robert) So, Doug, you've
done something remarkable.
You've made Mark Cuban grovel.
(laughs) He has not.
There's no groveling here.
(Lori laughs)
