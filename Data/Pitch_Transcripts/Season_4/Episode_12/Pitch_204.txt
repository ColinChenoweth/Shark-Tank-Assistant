First into the shark tank
is Doug Marshall
with the next generation
of face painting.
(chuckles)
Hello, sharks.
My name is Doug Marshall,
and I'm the creator
and owner
of the Game Face company.
We are here seeking
an investment of $450,000...
damn.
For a 25% equity stake
in the Game Face company.
The Game Face
is a patented product
that has revolutionized
the face-painting, makeup,
and costume mask industry.
Avid sport fans love
to paint their face,
and kids of all ages
love trick-or-treating
and dressing up
for halloween.
My son here, will,
is dressed up
for a maverick game
if he could only score
on some tickets.
And Katie, my daughter,
is dressed up
as a butterfly girl.
I would like to give
each of you a face...
I love it when we get
free stuff.
(Lori laughs)
The faces are one size
trimmed to fit.
I'm sporting
the Patriot face right now.
Kevin, what face
are you sporting?
(Lori laughs)
Mr. Wonderful's face.
Always smiling.
I would like to give you
a tiger face.
Ooh!
Thank you, Doug.
Lori, this is
an exotic mask face.
(laughing)
This skeleton face
May do just
the right thing for you.
(Robert) Oh, that's so
perfect for you, Kevin.
I like that.
That is perfect.
Over the past
year and a half,
all of our faces
have been wash-Away faces,
much like a tattoo.
So, we have had inquiries,
and people say,
"Well, why couldn't I
wear a face
and then just be able
to take it off?"
so, if I can grab a--
an edge here
of this face,
and as I peel away...
you can see that I'm not
having to wash it.
Wow!
"Mission: Impossible."
(Lori) so it's
a one-time use, Doug?
Yes.
But it's Peel off,
as opposed to wash off?
Right.
(Robert) It's incredible.
And it's--It's very
comfortable to wear.
I mean... (mouth full)
You can...
what?
Eat it? (laughs)
You can just eat it?
Why?
Is that just a nasty habit,
or are you trying to show us--
It's made with vegetable dyes,
and it's all water-based,
and it's very safe
for kids.
Let's go to the economics.
Tell us about the business,
your revenues, your costs.
We're in our fifth year
of business.
And let me preface this--
This is a part-time job
for me and my wife.
And we literally have an office
above our garage,
and we ship
out of our garage.
Our first year, we did
$6,700 worth of sales,
and last year,
we did $102,000.
We anticipate doing $105,000
this year.
$102,000,
and you are valuing
that you you have a part-time
$1.8 million company...
yes.
In your attic.
Why are you worth
$1.8 million?
Well, first of all, we haven't
even tapped into the big box.
We have about 400 customers
that are all retail,
small mom-and-pop shops.
We have
licensed ncaa teams.
We have a local license--
Texas tech, tcu,
and a&amp;m.
What does it cost you to make?
What do you sell 'em for?
So we wholesale them
for $2.50,
and our cost will range
from 25 cents to 60 cents.
It's all volume-driven.
Great margin.
Only our designs
are all retailed
for $4.99.
(Daymond) It is
a great margin.
(Mark) So you're paying
10 per--
It's a $5 item.
And, Doug, on the $102,000
that you sold last year,
how much money did you
make on that?
We made $32,000.
The numbers just don't add up.
Okay, kiddies, it's time
for you to leave the shark tank.
Your daddy's asked
for $1.8 million value
on his company.
This could get very ugly.
Yeah, we're gonna put on
some ugly faces...
Bye, guys.
And, uh, talk to your Dad.
(laughs)
Are there competitors?
There's no competitors.
Okay.
And there can't be
any competitors,
because of our patent.
(Robert) But--But, Doug,
that can't be true.
I've bought stickers--
the key is full face.
The key is full face.
Full face.
Full face.
What's your full-time job,
Doug?
I work for xerox
selling copiers.
You've got these big margins.
It's working for you.
Yeah.
Why still sell copiers
instead of do this full-time?
Well, we've got two kids.
We got--
We got into
the real estate bust
in east texas.
Okay, so you gotta
pay the bills, basically.
I gotta pay the bills.
What's the $450,000 for?
$300,000 would get me
on a salary
for the next three years,
get us going
with the licenses.
We want to get nba.
(Daymond) one second,
one second. Doug.
You just basically said,
"I want $100,000 a year
for 3 years."
I think that's absurd.
I-I didn't make any money
from my business for nine years.
I'm out.
Doug, I-I really like
the product.
But I gotta tell you,
when you said,
"I'm gonna take a $100,000
salary for the next 3 years,
and that's why I need
an investment"--
to guarantee that
for the next three years,
with all due respect, you gotta
be friggin' kidding me.
When I started my business,
do you know how many years
before I made $100,000?
And you're coming here
and asking me
to guarantee that for you?
This could turn water
into gold,
but I'm sorry, my friend.
I wouldn't want to invest
alongside with you.
I'm out.
Okay.
(Mark) What are you gonna
use the money for, Doug?
To get me to go full-time
and license acquisitions.
(Kevin) Doug, let me solve
that problem for you right now.
Here's a deal for you.
I'll give you $450,000.
Here's how I'll do it.
I'll give you $150,000
of it
for 30% of your company.
The other $300,000
you've asked for,
I'll give to you as a loan.
And I'm going to put
a 25-cent royalty
on every mask until I get
my $150,000 back.
(Lori) I-I would like
to make you an offer--
the $450,000.
But I'd like Mark
to go in with me.
And for 40% stake.
But I can immediately
get you into all the licensing
and into retailers
all over the country.
I would like to hear from Mark.
He's been awfully quiet.
(Lori) Yes.
Mark, what do you have to say?
Um...
I gotta tell you--
So, when I first
took over the mavs,
no one would go
to the games.
Right? I-I literally
had to hand out tickets.
And one of the promotions
I ran was--
and it's running
to this day--
That if you come
to a mavs game
with your face and/or body
fully painted
in mavs colors,
we're gonna have a contest,
and we'll pick the craziest
and give you free seats.
Yeah.
And it's such a mess.
There's paint.
There's mess everywhere.
Yes.
So I-I can relate.
It's a great option.
Yeah.
Okay, here's the offer
I'll make. Um...
I'll offer you
a million dollars...
Yowza!
For the entire company.
Whoa.
Included
in that million dollars
is a salary to you
of $80,000 a year
for five years.
Lori, I'll bring you in
if you'd like--
if you'd like to come in,
I'm happy to bring you in.
I'm in on Mark's offer.
I like it.
(Kevin) You understand
what's happening to you, right?
If you take that deal,
you get wiped out
right now.
You gave up your future.
You sold your soul.
You own nothing.
Doug has two offers
on the table--
$450,000 for a 30% stake
and a 25-cent royalty
from Kevin,
and $1 million
for 100% of the company
from Mark and Lori.
(Kevin) You understand
what's happening to you, right?
If you take that deal,
you get wiped out right now.
You gave up your future.
You sold your soul.
You own nothing.
You, my friend,
become a millionaire.
Doug, I saw your soul
drift out of the shark tank.
(mark laughs)
There it goes.
(Lori laughs)
It could've been worth
$15 million, but no.
That's exactly
what's happening.
(laughing)
So, my offer makes
a lot more sense.
I leave 70% of the upside
to you.
It's perfect.
I move lightning-Fast,
and I have all the connections.
I think that mark
would be the right partner.
With his abilities
and with mine together,
this can become
an overnight sensation.
So, Doug, when I started
my business,
a guy came along,
offered me $5 million.
It was more money
than I had ever dreamed of.
I went home,
and I told my wife about it.
And she looked at me
and she said,
"I don't believe
you started this business
"to work for somebody else
one day.
I think you can make it
much bigger."
(Robert) So, Doug, you've
done something remarkable.
You've made Mark Cuban grovel.
(laughs) He has not.
There's no groveling here.
(Lori laughs)
