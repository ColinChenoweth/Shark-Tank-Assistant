My name is Dan Grimm.
I'm Brant Myers, and we live
in San Luis Obispo, California.
I met Brant
in fifth grade.
We played soccer together.
We were in boy scouts together.
We've been friends
for the past 22 years.
Ooh!
Come on. Yeah.
Brant and I love to do
all sorts of things together.
(whirring)
Dan and I have always
been tinkerers.
So it's really no big jump for
us to go into business together.
He handles one side
of the business
that I don't want to do.
I do the things
that he don't want to do.
(clicking)
between the two of us,
we have one big brain,
and we can get anything done
that we put our mind to.
Well, thank you for your order.
All right, Dan.
We just got another sale.
Let's go celebrate.
Yeah!
(laughs)
(Dan) Our product is...
3-Way split!
Two of our favorite
pastimes in one.
When people first see
our product,
they don't know
what to think,
they don't know what to say.
They just drool.
(clink)
Bom.
Now we need a shark
to take our product
to the masses.
My name is Dan Grimm,
engineer, gaming nerd.
I'm Brant Myers,
card-carrying beer connoisseur.
Our product is the Arkeg.
And we're offering 33%
of our business
in exchange for $100,000.
We had a house in college
with a "kegerator"
and an arcade game.
First, we turned
the refrigerator
into a kegerator.
Then we fixed up
this old arcade machine
with parts
laying around the house.
We found ourselves
staying in on weekends,
saving a ton of money.
It was Paradise.
I went and poured myself
another beer,
looked back, and saw these
two massive appliances,
and a lightbulb went on.
Well, what if,
with my manufacturing expertise,
and Dan's superb
electronics skills,
we could create a product
that would combine
our two favorite pastimes?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Let me introduce to you
what has been called
the greatest invention
of all time...
the Arkeg!
(laughs)
Ta-Da!
(laughter)
Drink...
drink... and game.
(Lori laughs)
Oh, lord.
Drink n' game!
It not only pours
any beer you want,
but it comes pre-loaded
with some of the most popular
classic arcade games.
Is it a fridge?
It's a keg.
It doesn't just pour beer.
How about some wine
for the chef of the house
after a long day?
(clink)
(laughing)
That's how you drink your wine,
Kevin--From a tap.
Wine's not your thing,
what about some root beer
for the kids
and their friends?
Put one
in your family room,
in your game room,
your man cave.
Who wants a drink?
Guys, you're gonna need a drink
when you try to sell these.
I'm out.
Whoa!
(Brant) That was fast.
That's a record.
Was it the beer, or was it
the game that got you out?
It was the combination
thereof.
I just don't see it, guys.
Sorry.
Wait a minute.
Are you serious with this?
Absolutely.
It's a great product.
(Robert) How much is it?
$4,000 retail.
(Daymond) Wow.
(Kevin) $4,000?
Have you sold any of them?
Absolutely.
We've sold 20.
(Daymond) You come in here,
guys.
You're very, very rude.
You haven't even
offered me a beer.
My apologies, Daymond.
Wine, root beer, beer?
Can I pour that thing?
Let me see that.
(Brant) By all means.
It's actually
capitalizing
on the current trend,
which is
pour your own beer.
What do you got in wine?
Yeah, I'll have a wine.
It's a 2010 estate Pinot noir
from central coast, California.
Oh, please, I'll have some.
Kevin, would like some, uh,
night train or ripple?
No, no, I'm doing some,
uh, pinot, I think.
(laughing)
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
I see this as--
As more of a gimmick.
(clink)
I don't see myself
as being in the Arkeg business.
I'm out.
(Robert) I remember
when games like this
were very, very popular.
So I bought, like, 12 games.
I put 'em in my basement.
I thought my friends
could go down there all the time
and play.
I gotta tell you,
I haven't been in that room
for eight years.
You sold 20 units over 2 years.
That's low.
I'm out.
Guys, I think the beauty
of games now
is that they're small,
you can play it on your tablet.
This is just really
a dinosaur.
I just don't think
it's anything for me. I'm out.
Mr. Wonderful,
what are you doing?
I'm, uh, looking at it
as a limited opportunity.
Not every business
is destined to be huge.
I prefer to invest
in the ones that are.
Kevin,
with your capital injection,
we can get
our price point low enough
to get into big box stores.
You're talking about
a high-end refrigerator.
"look, honey, we can get
an arcade game
with beer that comes
out of it."
We have a lot of wives that
buy them for their husbands.
It's a great--
Listen, guys,
I appreciate the wine,
and it's actually
quite good.
Thank you.
I'm gonna take a pass.
I'm out.
No counteroffer?
All right, I'll get Lori
to give you $50,000.
(laughs)
Lori, we'll take it.
(laughter)
Gentlemen, cheers to Arkeg.
Cheers.
Thank you, guys.
Good luck, guys.
(Brant) Appreciate it.
Cheers.
Good luck.
Hello. My name
is Dan Rothwell,
and my product is Dura-tent.
I am seeking $50,000 for a 30%
equity stake in our company.
Spring is the official start
of picnics and parties
with family and friends
in the great outdoors.
But there is nothing
more irritating
than standing around
swatting the flies
away from the food,
and rightfully so.
(laughs)
How many times
have we seen the flies
hovering around and getting
on that dog poop
and walking around?
(buzzing)
Then that fly says...
(Mark laughs)
"there's a party going on.
I'm gonna go walk
on that potato salad."
(laughing)
And it does.
And it leaves behind
little particulate
of the disgust it just
picked up along the way.
Ew.
Poop potato salad,
anybody?
No, thank you.
Stop the madness.
(laughter)
Let's take a look at a clip
of a fly's day.
(Robert laughs)
Here's flies swarming
around the garbage.
Now they stick
their tongue out,
and saliva goes down, and they
mix it with your food,
and they suck it up,
and it's disgusting.
Flies leave behind parasites,
larvae, salmonella,
and even antibiotic-Resistant
e. Coli.
The same types of bacteria
that hospitalize
thousands of people
across the U.S.
Each and every year,
and unfortunately,
some of these people die.
Is this what you want for your
family and friends, sharks?
No!
Exactly not.
Our solution
to this problem
is the dura-Tent.
(sharks laughing)
As you can see,
it's a full enclosure.
Are we going camping
with that food?
We're going to the backyard
parties and picnics.
It's a full enclosure, not just
a little pop-up umbrella.
A little velcro on the door.
Flip it up, get your food.
Look at how much food
this protects.
Easy to clean,
easy to set up.
My customers love the product.
With your help,
we can not only make this
a national success,
but an international success.
How many have you sold?
50,000 units.
(Robert) Wow.
Wow.
Where do you sell them?
How much do they sell for?
It sells for $19.95--
On my picnic.
My banquet--Between, uh,
$29.95 and $34.95.
What's your cost?
My cost is, uh,
$4.65 on my picnic
and $7.27 on my banquet.
Out of the 50,000,
where are most of them sold?
County fairs.
This is a product
that screams demonstration.
That's the problem, right?
Or screams a media
that gets into the, uh,
awareness of people
that they have the product
available to them,
so when they go into the store
and they see it, so...
I've seen little mesh screens...
yes.
That you put over
individual bowls
or plates.
Yep.
Why is this better?
We are a full enclosure.
It is not going to
blow away on you.
You have a large banquet,
you're having a lot of food.
So, Dan, how did you
come up with this?
What's your background?
I'm an engineer--
Electrical engineer.
Uh, pulse power,
power electronics.
I went fusion research
to excimer laser technology,
and I sold my stock
and stepped away.
My goal was to take
a product from inception
to the consumer market.
I had some
technology ideas.
We're sitting around
my brother-In-Law's pool,
and mom is doing this, and we
came up with some sketches.
So you go from high-Tech
laser blasting aliens
to fly tents?
Exactly.
I love it.
(laughs)
But the numbers don't add up.
If you've got 300% margins
and you're doing $140,000
in business,
um... right?
Yes.
Then how--why don't you have
just a huge bottom line?
I'm--So last year, the majority
of my business was wholesale
more than it was retail.
Gotcha. Okay,
what's the breakdown?
7,800 in year 1...
Oh.
10,000 in year 2,
13,000, uh, in year 3,
and I'm on track to, uh,
be around 13,000 this year.
The numbers didn't add up
to me.
You said that you sold
50,000 of these
in the last three years.
But then you said
you sold 13,000...
50,000--
13,000 and 7,800.
Is that what you said?
First year was, uh,
7,800, 10,000,
13,000, and through today.
My apologies.
So this year,
you gonna do 19,000?
Pardon?
It's still not adding up.
Yeah, 'cause This year, you
would have to do 19,000 units.
'cause you came up
to 41,000 units.
My apology--My--My--
No, $31,000. You came up
to $31,000.
So, So, technically,
what have you sold?
An engineer that comes
on national tv
and can't do their math--
(Kevin) Oh...
that's not good. (laughs)
(Robert) So what--
my--My--My--That was--
That was--
So what's the math, Dan?
It--it--No. My apology.
35,000 heading
towards 40,000.
Dan, do you have a patent
on this?
Yes, we actually have,
uh, three patents in total.
Once we--
what is the chance
we could go
to one of the largest companies
that makes tent supplies
and say,
"listen, license my fly tent.
Let's get in bed together"?
the right deal, Kevin,
without a doubt,
but I'd like to know
the marketing plan behind that.
Well, I mean--
So, tell us specifically
how you would use
the $50,000
and how you think that'll
accelerate your sales?
Mark, the $50,000
is well thought-out.
I did
the national hardware show.
I had two key reps
into qvc.
Both of 'em
sent me contracts.
All roads lead to Lori.
So, $50,000 plus 50,000
that I have of inventory,
plus getting that pipeline
ready for our qvc.
We gotta keep pushing
This thing
until the big buyer
box stores pull it
because the consumer
wants it.
Well, Dan, let's--Let's hear
what Lori has to say.
So reps want to rep product.
Yes.
So of course
they're going to anything
that piques their interest,
because they don't have
anything to lose.
They can try,
get it on, see if it works.
Yes. Yes.
You know, it's not their money.
They didn't invest
in the product.
I agree.
Dan, I-I--You know,
I'm just, uh,
I'm just
a simple croatian guy.
My mother would have died
if I put my food
under a tent outside.
So I'm just not buying
into the concept of...
okay.
"Let's have a picnic
and put our food in the tent."
Yeah. (laughs)
I mean, I can't get there.
I'm out.
Thank you
for your consideration...
very much, Robert.
I think it's
an ingenious product.
Thank you.
And I think
it's well engineered.
You've really thought it out
and done some--
Some great things with it.
I just can't really
add value to it.
So with that, I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
I believe you're gonna
sell a bunch of fly tents.
I really do.
Thank you.
Thank you, Kevin.
Uh, well, don't thank me yet.
Well--
you haven't heard my offer.
(Kevin) Whoa, Dan.
And I'm the only shark up here
that speaks fly.
Daymond... I don't know
if you said...
Well, Dan, um,
I was on the fence.
So whether I like
to admit it or not,
I probably learn more
from the sharks up here
that are experts
in their field.
I'm gonna have to learn
from Lori's decision here.
I'm out.
And, Lori, there's no way
to come back in?
(Kevin) okay.
I'm sorry.
Just to be clear, Dan,
you are turning down my offer?
I don't think
he turned it down just yet.
At this level, you know...
obviously you'd hate
to turn down an offer,
but money isn't my problem
right now.
If we were to land
a big box store--
You did--You didn't
come here for money?
I... my goal was to take--
to--to take a product from
inception into the marketplace.
But that requires money.
Exactly. But it also requires
the marketing side of this.
But for you to give me
$50,000 and say,
"just pay me back,"
that doesn't get me
to the next level.
Ooh, Kevin, he's saying
there's smart money,
and there's dumb money,
and you're dumb money.
I want to save lives.
I want to save children.
I want to kill flies.
I am going to make it
more interesting for you, Dan,
and here's my new offer--
I'm giving you nothing.
However, I will buy
a small tent from you
at the full retail price
to help you,
but my offer
is off the table.
I'm out.
You just got $20
without a perpetual license.
That's good.
(Daymond) Good luck, man.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'm the only shark
that believed in you.
