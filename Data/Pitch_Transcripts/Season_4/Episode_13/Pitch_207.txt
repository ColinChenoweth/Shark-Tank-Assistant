First up are Dave Petrillo
and Dave Jackson
with an innovation
aimed at coffee lovers.
Hey, sharks.
I'm Dave Jackson.
And I'm Dave Petrillo.
We invented coffee joulies.
And I'm confident that
before we leave here today,
one or more of you is going
to invest $150,000
in exchange for a 5%
equity stake in our company.
(laughs)
Coffee is never
the right temperature.
It's served around
180 degrees fahrenheit.
If I were gonna pour
a glass of this for myself
and take a sip,
I'd burn my tongue
and not be able
to taste anything
for the rest of the day.
So what do I need to do?
I'm gonna wait around
for it to cool,
and finally, eventually,
it'll be perfect
for, like, that much time.
Before I know it,
it's too cold
and I'm pouring it
down the drain.
Coffee joulies solves
both of these problems.
First...
(clatters)
They absorb extra heat
from your coffee
and make it a drinkable
temperature within minutes.
And then they release
the heat that they stored
and keep it in
the perfect drinking range
for up to twice as long.
Wow.
Our favorite way to use
coffee joulies
is in this vacuum-Insulated
travel mug.
(sloshing)
in here, you can pour in
coffee as hot as you want,
and it'll be the perfect
drinking temperature
in five minutes,
and it'll stay that way
for over five hours.
We have five perfection packs
here for you to try out
with coffee that we poured
over three hours ago.
What is the right temperature
to drink coffee at?
The right temperature is
140 degrees fahrenheit.
It will not burn your tongue.
It's a pleasant temperature,
and it gives you good flavor
and aroma for your coffee.
Thermoses already
keep things hot.
But they keep them too hot,
especially right when you pour
your coffee into the thermos--
It'll be too hot
for a long period of time.
Holy smokes.
Lori, look at this.
Right.
Three hours ago.
Three hours old?
Yep.
How does it monitor
the temperature
when it gets in,
and it retains the heat
and monitors how much
it has to give off?
There's material
inside the joulies
that melts
at 140 degrees fahrenheit.
So you put it in hot coffee--
Coffee that's poured at 180--
It absorbs all that
extra energy,
cooling it down to 140.
When it hits 140,
the process reverses,
releasing the energy
back into the coffee,
keeping it hot longer.
Are you a chemist?
That's fascinating.
We're both
mechanical engineers.
We're both--Yeah.
Oh. What is this made out of?
Is this stainless steel?
The outside
is 18/10 stainless steel,
and the inside is a proprietary
phase Change material that's--
Did you come up with it?
Uh...
we did not.
There's a company
that makes it,
and we like that,
because they've done
the effort of making sure
it's safe.
So, Dave,
what's the response been?
Wait, wait. Let him finish.
Let him finish up, Kevin.
It's all derived
from plant sources,
so it's edible.
You can actually eat this stuff.
So what is it that--
That's inside?
As soon as you sign your n.D.A.,
we can talk about that.
(laughter)
We have a design patent
that's been issued,
and we have a utility patent
that's pending,
and we have, uh, trademarks
in the United States
and in China.
Does this work with tea
as well?
Yes.
Yeah. It works with
any hot beverage.
Tea, hot chocolate. Someone
put them in oatmeal, we heard.
People use them in soup.
And you only need one
in a--in a mug?
One per 4 ounces of coffee
is our guideline.
(Lori) One for 4 ounces.
Oh!
Yeah.
So I'm, like, plopping
multiple of these.
Multiple of them in. There's
five in your coffee right now.
That's a 16-Ounce
travel mug, and--
There's five in here?
Wow.
Yeah, there's five
in there.
So you have to walk around
like you got a pack
of marlboros on you.
I drink three, four cups
a day. I love coffee,
but I don't carry a mug
with me.
I can't see me carrying
jewels around.
Joulies.
(mark and Lori) Joulies.
Joulies. Sorry. So who's
the target market?
In our past sales,
we've had the most traction
as a gift item.
Because everyone
drinks coffee,
and these are terrific
to give someone
who's a-a real
coffee enthusiast.
How much does one cost to make?
One joulie to make
costs $3.65,
including all the testing.
And you're selling them
for how much?
$50--
$50 for a set of 5.
What were your sales
for the year?
$575,000 last year.
Five--Yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
What did you profit
on the $575,000?
Last year our profit
on the books was like $50,000.
We spent a lot of money
on patents, tooling, legal fees.
And you expensed
all of that?
Yeah.
We're--We're
cash flow positive.
Dave, what are you
gonna sell this year?
Over a million dollars.
Last year was the year
of online sales for us.
But our focus this year
is gonna be going
into wholesale accounts.
We have 2 different retailers
with 1,000 stores each
that want to carry
our product.
Which ones?
Bed bath &amp; beyond, officemax.
So, um, Dave and Dave,
you've been gracious enough
to offer us 5%.
(laughs)
so you're valuing the company
at $3 million.
That's right.
(Kevin) Are you gonna
address his question?
No, no, no.
They don't need to address me.
Is there a question there?
They don't need to address me,
'cause I think you guys
are about to do some
really invasive surgery on them
about that 5%. Um...
I'm out.
We're so far apart,
in my view.
When--When I fund startups,
I want a minimum of 33%.
I don't know how
to value you right now.
I'll give you $150,000,
and what I want
is $6 from every order
till I get it back, okay?
And then $1 in Perpetuity
after that.
I'll go in
on the deal with you,
if you would like a partner.
Can you put some power
behind it on qvc?
I think so.
I think we can.
I welcome you in, Lori.
Kevin, I can help you
with the bed bath &amp; beyond.
I mean, daymond and I
do deal with them.
I think I can get that
faster into retail
and some of the other retailers,
like target.
You've got three sharks
now under that structure.
You keep the company.
There's one--One person
we haven't heard--
(mark) But wait. There's more.
We haven't heard from yet.
But wait. There's more.
First of all, I think
you're crazy to go retail
and wholesale.
Okay.
Absolutely loony bin nuts.
Because your costs
go through the roof.
Okay.
I'd like to get involved,
but I don't know want to be
in the wholesale distribution
business,
because you lose control
of your own destiny,
particularly this early.
Right?
You gotta crawl
before you ball. Right?
And the minute it goes
to bed bath &amp; beyond,
they control who you are.
(Lori) This doesn't make
any sense.
I've done over $500 million
in retail sales,
and the reason?
Because I do exactly
the opposite
of what mark just said.
You get it out as wide
and as fast
into everybody that you can.
You have the whole world
Knowing what joulies is fast.
If you go with the way
mark was saying,
you could crawl along
like a snail forever.
You know what?
If They would allow me,
I'll come in on this, too,
to do the retail,
'cause I believe in it.
And when Lori puts it on,
then you can do "As seen on tv"
in the stores.
Are you gonna let him back in?
He seemed--
I don't know,
earlier he was kinda...
(Lori laughs)
Yeah, he was a little--He was
a little poopy, wasn't he?
The truth about this guy is,
he is Mr. Retail.
And even though sometimes
I don't like him,
I like to make money.
So enemies become friends
When they can help you.
Kevin, let's bring daymond in.
We need daymond on this.
(Lori) I would bring daymond in
for sure.
I'm happy to have him in.
(Kevin) Here's the offer.
Very simple.
You get $150,000
from 4 sharks.
Every time you sell a unit,
give us $6 back.
Any unit?
Any unit.
Even wholesale, where
our margins today are--
Any unit, $6 back.
You'll get focused on this,
because as soon as we get
our money back,
it drops to a dollar.
That's it. And you keep
100% of the company
for when that big coffee company
Comes and says,
"I'm buying you now
for an obscene amount of money,"
so you can buy suits.
(mark) right.
So just think about that.
First of all, you'd be
an idiot if you bought a suit.
But--
Do you have to think
about that?
Is there an offer that
you'd like to make?
(mark) Sure.
I'd like to make an offer.
Let's hear it.
Okay. I'm gonna offer you
$250,000
for 12%, no royalties.
My preference is that
you don't go
wholesale/retail
and qvc right away,
because I see this as having
a great opportunity
for a liquidity event.
I see this as being able
to sell the company.
When you go to sell the company
and they say,
"Let's look at your numbers,"
first Big old red flag
is going to be
a perpetual royalty.
Doesn't matter
if it's a penny.
It's not gonna be negotiated
out on a buyout
as simply as it sounds.
Absolutely will.
Happens every day.
Can I finish?
When you have a company
that is looking to grow,
you can't be on qvc
every week all the time.
Tell that to George Foreman,
who did about $400 million
over five years.
And he has to go back
to that environment
and to--
No, he doesn't.
He's in retail.
It's in every single store
all over the country.
It's one of the largest
retail stores--
It was one of the largest
Retail products ever. Ever.
He gave--He gave you--
he gave you his offer.
Can we call our friend?
Yeah. We're gonna--
We're gonna call
an adviser that we have.
Go ahead.
Well, there's
a difference in the offers
and there's a difference
in the strategy.
Yeah.
And they're very--
and there's a difference
in the experience
of the people that are giving
you this advice and offers.
They're all very different.
Good luck to you.
All right.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
I say we go up to $9.
(chuckles)
I think we're in trouble
on the, uh,
wholesale amount, Kevin.
Why? It can support 6 bucks.
(daymond) No, it can't.
His manufacturing Cost
is too high right now.
I-I saw his look
on the wholesaling.
Yeah. I think wholesale--
I gotta tell you, I think--
Wholesale you can have--
I think if we don't
change that offer,
we're gonna lose this deal.
Good job, Dave.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, great job.
Great product.
Congratulations.
Thanks a lot. I'm excited.
This is gonna be fun.
Nice meeting you.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, man.
Wow, all the sharks were in.
Oh, there was one missing.
Oh.
(Lori laughs)
You guys were just as shocked
as I am.
(laughing)
Mark, you know in the shark tank
sometimes you win
and sometimes you lose.
No, not me.
I think you just lost.
Wow. I love his confidence
even when he's defeated.
He's weeping inside.
Trust me.
We came to "Shark tank,"
got exactly what we wanted.
And we didn't even give up
any of our equity.
It was amazing.
It's perfect.
