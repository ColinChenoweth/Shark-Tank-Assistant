if you don't take my offer,
Nicole, the bear dies.
Or swim.
(Lori) This is what I always do.
Shark fight! Shark fight!
(cheering and laughter)
I'm Nicole townend, and I'm from
Huntington beach, california.
Yeah, dad!
Yeah!
I'm married to professional
skateboarder tosh townend,
and we have a 2-year-Old
daughter named jemmaly.
Stop it!
Having a 2-year-Old daughter
is so messy.
She's constantly picking up
things,
putting them in her mouth,
dragging things in the house
from outside.
It's a constant battle keeping
things clean and germ-Free.
Jemmaly, he's dirty.
He needs his own bath.
I found it hard to keep
everything
safe and clean for my daughter.
Surprisingly, I found that
there was nothing on the market
to fix this problem.
Due to the slowing economy,
tosh hasn't been getting
as much money for skateboarding.
I had to start
raising money on my own
with a business that nobody
had ever heard of before.
If I don't get an investment
from the sharks,
I could lose my business,
my house.
My family is depending
on the success of this company.
So I have a lot on the line.
Hello. I'm Nicole townend,
creator of Teddy needs a bath.
I'm seeking $50,000 in exchange
for 10% of my business.
Teddy needs a bath
is the first
Washer and Dryer bag
for stuffed animals.
We've all seen the kid
who's been dragging his Teddy
around the mall floor
all day,
and we know it's gonna
end up in his bed that night,
or even worse,
in his mouth.
(chuckles)
How gross is that?
Teddy needs a bath
comes to the rescue,
making it easy for parents
to safely clean
their child's
favorite friend
while knowing it's not gonna
get destroyed in the process.
The best part about
Teddy needs a bath
is that it's so easy
to use.
Simply throw a dozen
small toys inside...
(zipper unzips)
(clicks)
Or...
one large dirty Teddy.
Bad Teddy.
(laughter)
Then you zip up the big,
chunky, kid-Friendly zipper.
How can he breathe in there?
It's porous.
(laughter)
You throw it
in the Washer alone
or with a load
of your laundry on gentle.
Then it goes straight
into the Dryer on low.
When that's done...
you have a fresh, fluffy,
germ-Free toy
to go back into the arms
of your loved one.
(laughs)
I also have some
samples of the bag
to give to you guys,
and the children's book that
I created to go along with it.
Thank you.
Nicole, obvious question--
Why can't I just
throw the Teddy in there?
Oh, it scratches
the plastic eyes,
the seams can get busted out,
and it can also cause
a lot of damage
to your Washer and Dryer.
We're trying to build
awareness
So, Nicole, what period of time
did you just cover?
Six months?
Six months.
And what were your total sales
in that six months?
$12,000.
Have you shown it to any
of the baby big box players,
the buyers?
Yes, we're--So babies"R"Us
is very happy with us,
and they've asked us
to come to New York.
So you think you're going to get
into all babies"R"Us's, right?
Yes. Mm-hmm.
Did they tell you that?
Was that an assurance,
or was it just...
"We really like your sales
online.
"We'd like you to come out
and discuss
testing it
in our brick-and-Mortar."
I really want
to tell you guys,
the cool thing about
the Dryer sheets is that,
first of all, there's no
Dryer sheets that I'm aware of
that have fun, funky smells.
So this one smells exactly
like cotton Candy.
Now I like that.
(mark) Yeah,
I like that, too.
(laughs) Yeah.
If you guys wanna smell it,
it's really fun.
Bring it on.
And it's all natural
ingredients,
because we want to sell to
the whole foods and the mothers.
Smells really Good. (laughs)
I think that's
a bigger business.
That smelled like cotton Candy.
My kids would love it.
I think you have a home run
there with the--
With the way
that Teddy smells.
Yeah, I think so, too.
I see there's a need.
I'm just wondering
how big a need,
how much this would catch on.
You don't really know yet.
You're at the beginnings.
And I have seen bags like this.
So for that reason, I'm out.
With our three kids,
it's the biggest pain...
The only offer I'm aware of
right now, Nicole, is mine.
Nicole, I'll make it easier.
You've convinced me
that it serves a need.
Okay.
So I want to make you
an offer.
But is $50,000 enough?
If you're gonna have
all these purchase order--
Yeah, I'm gonna need an investor
that I can come back to again
for the purchase orders.
Here's what I'm willing
to offer.
Because you're gonna need
more capital...
Mm-hmm.
And the better you do, obviously
the more capital you need,
because you want to be able
to hit those $10,000,
$20,000, $50,000
minimum orders...
right.
I'm willing to invest
$100,000...
but I want 40% of the company.
I'll drop the equity ask
from 50% down to 30%,
'cause he's being too greedy.
So my offer now is,
I will give you the $50,000
for 30% of the company...
and I want a 10% royalty
on sales to get my cash back.
But when it gets returned,
it drops to 5%.
And if you need more cash,
call Mr. Wonderful.
He's always there.
Do the math, Nicole.
Can I speak with my husband
about your 40%?
Yes. Feel free.
Okay. I'll be right back.
Nicole, welcome back.
Hi. Thank you.
So, Nicole,
you've got two offers here.
Right.
But before you speak,
another piece of information
you need to know--
No, no "before you speaks."
No, this is important, mark.
You don't take my offer, Nicole,
the bear dies.
(laughter)
Okay, I have to say, Kevin,
I'm blown away
by your intrigue in this.
The only problem I have with
that is the royalty's forever.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop
the royalty
that's there forever.
I'll just keep the 10% there
till I get my money back.
Okay, let me ask this
to mark first.
I have a counteroffer
for you.
Okay.
$100,000 for 30%,
but with a 10% royalty
until you get your money back.
Done, done, and done.
Whoo!
Bear dies.
Oh!
(laughter)
Thank you. Oh, wow.
Congratulations. Thank you.
Thank you.
It's gonna be great.
Thank you.
Good job, Nicole.
Thank you.
Good job, Nicole.
(Lori) Congratulations.
Good luck.
It was so nice
to meet all of you.
(mark) Thank you.
Whew!
The product is great,
the design is great.
She's done a phenomenal job.
I don't care.
The bear still dies.
(laughs)
I saw it.
I got a deal
with the sharks!
We got it! We got it! Yay!
No way! Yes!
Can you believe it?
Oh, my gosh.
Ooh!
Big, happy family.
