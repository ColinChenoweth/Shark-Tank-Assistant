if you don't take my offer,
Nicole, the bear dies.
Or swim.
(Lori) This is what I always do.
Shark fight! Shark fight!
I'm married to professional
skateboarder tosh townend,
Hello. I'm Nicole townend,
creator of Teddy needs a bath.
I'm seeking $50,000 in exchange
for 10% of my business.
Teddy needs a bath
is the first
Nicole, obvious question--
Why can't I just
throw the Teddy in there?
Oh, it scratches
the plastic eyes,
the seams can get busted out,
So, Nicole, what period of time
did you just cover?
Six months?
Six months.
The only offer I'm aware of
right now, Nicole, is mine.
Nicole, I'll make it easier.
You've convinced me
that it serves a need.
Okay.
So I want to make you
an offer.
But is $50,000 enough?
If you're gonna have
all these purchase order--
Yeah, I'm gonna need an investor
that I can come back to again
for the purchase orders.
Here's what I'm willing
to offer.
Because you're gonna need
more capital...
Mm-hmm.
Do the math, Nicole.
Nicole, welcome back.
Hi. Thank you.
So, Nicole,
you've got two offers here.
Right.
But before you speak,
another piece of information
you need to know--
No, no "before you speaks."
No, this is important, mark.
You don't take my offer, Nicole,
the bear dies.
(laughter)
Okay, I have to say, Kevin,
I'm blown away
by your intrigue in this.
The only problem I have with
that is the royalty's forever.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop
the royalty
that's there forever.
I'll just keep the 10% there
till I get my money back.
Okay, let me ask this
to mark first.
I have a counteroffer
for you.
Okay.
$100,000 for 30%,
but with a 10% royalty
until you get your money back.
Good job, Nicole.
Thank you.
Good job, Nicole.
(Lori) Congratulations.
Good luck.
It was so nice
to meet all of you.
(mark) Thank you.
Whew!
The product is great,
the design is great.
She's done a phenomenal job.
I don't care.
The bear still dies.
(laughs)
I saw it.
I got a deal
with the sharks!
We got it! We got it! Yay!
No way! Yes!
Can you believe it?
Oh, my gosh.
Ooh!
Big, happy family.
