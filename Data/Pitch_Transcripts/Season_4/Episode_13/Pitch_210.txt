to the importance of removing
germs and allergens
from stuffed animals.
There's something I never
thought of, actually,
to tell you the truth, about
how dirty the Teddy may be.
A lot of parents,
they don't think
it's something
that you need to do.
There are bags out there
like that already
for cleaning
other types of laundry.
But they're all mesh.
I have seen ones
that are cotton.
What is to stop, like, anybody
from just making
this kind of thing?
Well, it's patent pending.
There was no bag
with a zipper?
There's no laundry bag
that's geared towards
WASHING stuffed animals.
So tell us what it costs
to make one
and how you've been
doing at it.
Okay.
So it costs me $2.25
to get it made overseas,
and I retail for $14.99.
We did our hard launch
in January,
when we were featured
on the "today" Show.
We've been on babies"R"Us'
web site for four months,
and we've sold
a couple hundred units,
but this is solely based
on word of mouth.
right.
Trying to figure out
what's causing the allergies,
the eczema.
Right.
And you go down a checklist
trying to remove everything.
But, mark, somebody's washing
your Teddy bears, for sure.
I do all the washing
at our house.
No way!
Oh, whatever!
When was the last time you did
a load of laundry, Robert?
Anyway...
I did my own
a couple days ago.
(laughs)
Are moms gonna go out
and spend $14 for really...
in a heartbeat.
We have interest,
and rite aid, walgreens,
cvs, and target have all asked
for samples, and have them.
It's interesting, but I just
can't see women buying it
and you growing
a market out of it.
I don't see it. I'm out.
Big valuation, I think,
is a little too early.
You need to be
a little more proven
for me to be able
to help you.
So I'm out.
I'll tell you a little story
which is really moving me.
I'm very moved,
because when I was a child...
(daymond) aw.
I was allergic to house dust.
I used to--
Every week I'd have to go
get an injection.
And I had no idea
Teddy was killing me.
Seriously.
I wouldn't have hung out
with Teddy so much.
It's serious.
That's why I really have
a connection with what
you're trying to do.
I see that. (chuckles)
are you one of those
30% of men
who travel
with their Teddy bears?
Yes!
No!
(laughter)
You are not worth
half a million dollars.
I'm sorry.
I'll give you the $50,000
for 50% of the business.
But I have to have
10% of sales...
(laughs) Kevin.
(Kevin) Paid to me
every month.
Because I'll never get
my cash back.
And after I get my cash back,
I'll drop that to 5%.
Okay.
(mark) Have you done
any independent testing
to get, like--Here's exactly
what the benefits are
compared to a pillowcase
or anything else?
Oh, yes.
So I teamed up
with this manufacturer
of Washer and dryers--
Frigidaire and electrolux.
Okay.
They supplied
an antimicrobial
test laboratory.
Hello.
My name is Beau Oyler.
And I'm Jared aller.
And our company is urbio.
We're asking
for $300,000
for 12% of our company.
Inside of each of us is a need
to connect with nature
in a meaningful way,
and indoor plants are
a fantastic way of doing this.
People living in Large homes...
like all of you guys.
You've got plenty of space
for plants.
But for the rest of us
living in small spaces...
like Beau and myself...
and most people in the world,
we simply don't have
the room for indoor plants.
So Jared and I put our minds
together and created urbio,
the modern vertical garden.
Urbio is
a fully modular system,
so it can fit
on any wall.
And these little guys
have a magical twist--
Super-Strong magnets
that allow it to attach
to any metal surface,
including our metal wall plates,
which are super easy
to install.
(clicks)
Clickety-Clack,
and just like that,
you can have your own
urbio design for your lifestyle.
We've been absolutely
blown away
at the reception
urbio's received.
We've been featured
in multiple magazines,
blogs, and even tv shows.
And all of this
just in the last five months.
And the worldwide
response to urbio
has also been insane.
We've been sold
in over 50 different countries,
and the vertical garden is
just the tip of the iceberg.
We have infinite possibilities
for urbio
in every room in your home.
Yeah, such as kitchen,
bathroom, and office.
But the best part about urbio
is the experience.
Lori, come on down.
We'd like you to have
the experience
of placing an urbio magnetic pot
up on the wall.
There's a spot
right there for ya.
(clicks)
Whoa. It's strong.
I know, right?
Right.
How cool is that?
Very cool.
If there's one thing
that urbio knows how to do,
it's how to grow green.
So we're looking forward
to partnering with you
so that we can watch
urbio grow.
Thank you, Lori.
(mark) Hey, guys,
before you get started,
I get pitched all the time,
and these guys had
contacted me before
and--And solicited
an investment from me.
So I have to disqualify myself
because I know...
Yeah.
More about this investment
than the other sharks do,
which gives me
an unfair advantage, so...
I have to say I'm out,
but pitch away.
Yeah. We understand.
Wow.
You said you were blown away
by the response.
Why don't you blow me away
by your sales?
We have $125,000 in sales
in the first 4 months.
Where were you selling?
We've been selling in--
Through our web site.
We're in, uh,
about 25 different
brick-and-Mortar stores
right now.
Any big ones
that we would know,
or more mom-and-Pop?
We're working on that,
but we're--
Yeah.
But we have a large
distribution of mom-and-Pops.
Well, tell me a little bit
about it.
Like, what would that cost?
The urbio vessels
start at about $15
and go up to about $35.
To the customer?
to the customer.
That's full retail.
Does that include
the back plate?
And the back plates
are also $15.
And what about the smaller cups
that you have up there?
These ones here?
We call these the shorty.
Shorties. How much are they?
The shorties are 15 bucks.
And what does it cost you
to make each different piece?
So, the shorty
costs us $3.50,
so we have about
a 75% margin.
Is there anything out there
similar, though?
There is nothing on the market
that's like this.
There are lots
of vertical garden products,
but they have flaws in them.
They Leak a lot, and when
people try to water 'em
on the wall, they get moldy
and they stink.
How did you come up with it?
We're both trained
industrial designers.
We've designed products
that are now
in Williams-Sonoma,
best buy, target, costco.
We have a design studio
(Kevin) Yeah?
At which we design
for clients.
This here is our first
consumer product company
that we're launching.
You see, that's a bit of
a problem for me as an investor,
'cause I want you focused
on what I'm putting
my money into,
not some other clients.
Hmm.
How do I get you
to stop worrying
about those people and worrying
about this business full-time?
We have a great team--
Eight designers.
They're cranking out
work all the time,
which is a good thing,
because this is
an infinitely expandable,
uh, product line.
But what are you gonna do
with the $300,000 today?
We have orders pouring in.
Our inventory's flying out.
We need to order
more inventory.
So we need working capital.
We're not asking you
to pay our salaries.
We're asking you to help us
fill the next orders
and get more product
in our warehouse.
I'm gonna make you
an offer, okay?
I'll give you $300,000
for 20%,
but you can't take a salary
from this company.
You have to take a distribution
that all the shareholders get,
and you get to decide
when that is.
I want to put your shoes
in the same position I'm in.
Let me say this.
I love great design.
I love the purity of stuff that
is beautiful for what it is.
I'll make you an offer
with a bit of a twist.
Okay.
I'll give you $400,000
for the same 20%,
$300,000 for the equity,
and $100,000 to go out
and hire a guy
to run this full-time.
I think you need somebody
to come in
and quarterback
all the activity and flurry
that's going on with you.
You guys can be the brains
behind it,
but you need somebody there
every day, 24 by 7.
Yeah.
That's my offer.
(daymond)
I'll tell you what, guys.
I think the--I think
the other two offers
are pretty generous.
I just can't understand
that valuation.
And maybe I'm just a greedy
Savage, 'cause I would ask...
(chuckling)
Way more than what the other
sharks are offering right now.
So...
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thanks, daymond.
Do you have any type of
intellectual property on it?
Do you have a patent?
We have a design
and utility patent pending.
Are you willing to work to
reduce the cost of the product?
Yes.
Okay.
The magnets are a significant
portion of our cost.
So I took a plane to China,
and I found an awesome,
um, magnet manufacturer.
That's in the pipeline
right now,
and we're reducing our cost.
Okay. I'll make you an offer.
$300,000 for 20%.
And I think you know
that through qvc, drtv,
and brick-and-Mortar
retail stores and Online,
we will blow this out there
fast and furious,
because that is
what I am best at.
You know what I find
interesting?
You never talked about
the beauty of the design.
We will. I love it.
You never talked about
the design.
They know I love it.
Can't you tell I love it?
Yeah.
You guys are cool and hip
and so is your product,
and that's the focus
of this market.
Oh, my god.
People that are in small spaces
just starting out
that want something
really hip.
People that are watching qvc
are grandmothers.
Oh, my god.
Face it--
Sometimes you remind me
of a golf ball--
Small, bald, and I want to
hit you 300 feet away from me.
The point is,
am I wrong?
(laughter)
(Robert) That was good.
Lori, that was the best line
you've had so far.
That was really Good.
That was really Good.
Guys, we have three offers.
What are you gonna do?
but Beau and Jared have
three offers on the table.
Guys, we have three offers.
You have, uh, $300,000
for 20% by Mr. O'Leary.
You have $400,000 for 20%
by Robert,
with $100,000 going to
have somebody to head it up,
and then you have $300,000
for 20% by Lori.
What are you gonna do?
I know I've gotten
products out there
literally within months.
I can sell hundreds of thousands
of dollars in minutes,
but also I have connections
to all of the retailers
across the country
and internationally.
Jared, do you know what I hear?
And I might have better
sourcing for you...
Jared--
Because I also have
factories and manufacturers
that I use all over the world.
Jared, you know what I hear?
I hear--
It is all one-Stop--
I hear, "me, me, me, me."
This is your design.
He's not hearing,
"me, me, me, me."
(daymond) Shark fight!
Shark fight!
This is your design.
It's not a partnership.
This is what I always do.
Shark fight! Shark fight!
Thank you for your offers.
These are all great offers,
and as we look
at all the sharks,
you guys would be
fantastic partners,
each of you
for your different aspects.
So let me sweeten the deal
a little bit more.
(laughs)
This is a purchase order
from the container store.
18,000 units
just for the first order--
Nationwide, every store,
committed end cap
in every single store.
What's the dollar amount?
$150,000.
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna go down to 15%...
ooh.
If you say yes to me right now.
(Richard) guys, I offered you
$400,000 for 20%.
I'll split it with you.
I'll do $400,000 at 17.5%.
(Kevin) I'm gonna leave
my offer alone.
I think I bring
a unique skill to this.
Anybody can get on
direct selling television.
Oh, that is so not True.
It's so True.
I think I bring
a lot of value
that I want reflected.
I'm gonna stand firm.
Yeah.
So, guys, you have--
You have
three firm offers.
Yes.
So what are you gonna do?
(whispers) Lori?
(whispers) Yeah.
(normal voice)
We're gonna keep our equity.
Lori, we'd like to accept
your offer.
Will you be
our business partner?
Great. Yes.
Love to.
(laughter)
It's great.
Thank you.
Awesome.
We're gonna do
great things.
We're so excited.
Me, too. Me, too.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you very much.
Awesome. Thank you so much.
(mark) Congrats, guys.
All right. Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.
Good luck to you.
Great to be with you.
I feel like throwing this
at you.
(laughter)
Sorry.
Sorry, Robert.
Thank you. Thanks.
(daymond) Lori...
wow.
You stood firm,
you called Kevin a golf ball,
and you made a profit.
That was the best part
of the whole bit.
You won't be coming golfing
with me.
(laughs)
