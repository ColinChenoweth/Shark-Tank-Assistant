Sharks,
we're Naomi and Jerry Hancock,
and our family business
is sub zero ice cream,
and today we're gonna
blow you away.
We're asking for $300,000...
(sighs)
(whooshing)
(Lori) Whoo!
(sharks laughing)
Whoo!
You couldn't remember that
on your own?
You had to be reminded?
(laughing)
How do you forget that?
Exactly. You're right.
We're asking you for $300,000
for 12% of our business.
Welcome
to sub zero ice cream.
We've developed a method
of making
frozen desserts
right in front of the customer
using liquid nitrogen.
Cool.
So how do we do it?
Well, let's show you.
Today, Jerry is gonna
make me some ice cream.
Imagine an ice cream store
without a single freezer,
for the possibilities
are endless.
And you have fresh, frozen,
custom ice cream
made to order from start
to finish within one minute...
(whooshing)
Oh, cool!
From order to delivery.
Wow.
Within seconds,
your ice cream goes
from liquid to frozen.
We never get tired
of seeing people's reaction
as they see
their ice cream freeze
right in front of their eyes.
(scraping)
Kids love it.
They go crazy over it.
In fact, once they've seen
sub zero,
they don't want to go
anywhere else.
So we have some samples
for you to try.
Sharks, enjoy your ice cream.
Take your time.
If it starts to melt,
we can refreeze it...
thank you.
Unlike any other
ice cream shop in the country.
(speaks indistinctly)
Wow, it's really hard.
For Lori, we have the chocolate
with Chocolate cookie dough.
For you I made coconut
with Berries, Kevin.
It tastes great.
So why go to this extreme
for ice cream?
(Naomi) first of all, it's more
creamy than regular ice cream.
The faster you freeze ice cream,
the creamier it is.
(daymond) Tastes like crap.
It's really good.
Really Good.
(mark) Mine's really good.
This tastes like crap.
Does it?
Mine's really good.
No, I'm just messing with you.
Ohh.
(laughter)
By removing
expensive freezer equipment,
we reduce the cost
of ownership for a store
and we reduce
the carbon footprint
of a frozen dessert shop.
We're not just
reinventing ice cream.
We're reinventing
the entire ice cream experience.
With your help, we can
blow away our competitors.
Who'd like to join us
and scream for our ice cream?
(laughs)
(whooshing)
Whoo!
Can you freeze Kevin?
(laughter)
Listen, before I get frozen,
I got a couple of questions.
And my biggest concern--
And by the way,
this is
very good ice cream.
Very creamy, different.
Presentation's very interesting.
If I have a line
of ten kids waiting...
right.
How fast can you process
each order?
Our average is about
30 seconds per person
from the time they order
to the time they're checked out
of the cash register.
My first job was
an ice cream scooper.
Been there, done that.
(laughs)
And what used to drive me crazy
was somebody saying,
"Can I have a taster?
No, no, I don't want the rest,
but--No, no, no.
I want the chocolate."
We don't have tasters,
'cause it's not made yet.
I can see Kevin as a little kid.
A kid--Another kid
keeps asking you for that
and you go,
"if I give you all the tasters,
I'm not gonna make any money."
(laughter)
is this a retail play?
That's right.
It is.
(Lori) Do you have
a number of outlets?
Yes.
(Jerry) We have
18 stores currently,
and we have about eight more
that have been sold.
Corporate or franchises?
2 corporate stores,
18 franchises.
Where are they located?
Washington,
Idaho, utah, arizona,
and california.
Jerry, is it perfectly safe,
the nitrogen?
Liquid nitrogen
is very, very cold.
I mean, it's 321 degrees
below zero.
It's what doctors use
to freeze off your warts.
No, it's the same stuff
they used to freeze Han solo.
Right?
(both) Yeah, exactly.
In fact, here...
oh!
There you go.
You're this far away.
That's--
There you go.
That's the image right there.
Yeah. Yeah.
What happens if I hire
an 18-year-old
and they freeze their hand off?
Well, we've developed processes
to make it safe.
We use nozzles
and we use systems
that are low pressure
so that they really
don't have the impact.
Okay, let's get
into the numbers,
because you're asking
for a lot.
$2.4 million value.
That's right.
Walk me through
the numbers.
So what were sales in 2011?
What do you think
they'll be this year?
2011, they were $2 million,
and this year we're projected
to be about $4 million
by the end of the year.
What's the capital cost to
set up a 600-Square-Foot unit?
A typical store
that's full-Blown
is between $125,000
and $175,000.
How much of your own money
is into this?
We've got about $750,000.
Oh.
Whoa.
Wow.
That's a lot of money.
We just took a loan--
Our first loan out
for $275,000.
If it costs about $125,000
to open a store...
Mm-hmm.
It's been seven years.
You've only opened up
two corporate stores.
Where did the $750,000 go?
Well, a lot of it was
developing this--
The systems and--
Did you lose a lot of money
along the way?
Um, a year and a half ago,
we--we partnered
with someone,
and the management decisions...
Well--
That he was making
was not right for the company.
And in order to, um,
to--to leave that situation,
we needed to buy him out.
For how much?
(Robert) Wow.
$500,000.
Ohh!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Things got very chilly
in here.
Why would you want to take on
another partner right now,
when you could grow this company
the way you've been doing it?
Well, there are some problems
that we've had
in our growth pattern
that I think that the sharks
Can help us with.
(Robert) such as?
Yeah, what are the problems?
(Jerry) Well, locations.
To get those "a" locations
and to get into stadiums,
you've got to have
some backing,
or else they're not gonna
really take you seriously.
You want us to strategically
help you
make a lot of calls and--
And help you with that, right?
I mean, it's, uh,
it's part of it.
So, guys, um,
I like the idea.
I-I just don't know
if I have the hours and the time
to give you the money
as well as Come
and help you work
with this project.
I'm out.
Well, thank you.
Okay. Thank you.
Unfortunately,
the ice cream operator business
is incredibly crowded.
I don't believe your business
right now is worth $2.4 million.
It's interesting.
Right.
But not enough for me
to invest. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay.
You lost $500,000
by hiring the wrong guy.
To me, you're trying
to do the same thing.
I--
at the same--
You're trying to bring in
people from the outside
and asking for $300,000.
At the same time,
I'm not sure--
And my guiding principle
is always
if it doesn't
make sense to me--
(Jerry) Well, uh--
Then it doesn't make sense.
Okay, well, let me--
For that reason,
Jerry, Naomi, I'm out.
Okay.
(Lori)
I think it's a great idea.
Right.
I think you two
are a great, strong,
willing-to-Do-
Whatever-it-takes team.
I think you can get there
on your own
and still own
your whole company.
And for that reason, I'm out.
Thanks.
Appreciate that. Thank you.
I like the idea. I think
you've got a lot of potential.
But I don't really want to be
in the ice cream
franchise business.
I will eat some more
of your ice cream, though,
But, um, I'm out.
Okay.
All right.
Well, I appreciate that.
Yes, we appreciate
your time.
Thank you, guys.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
Oh, well.
(sighs) Yeah.
We--Uh... we did okay.
(laughs)
We said everything
we wanted to say.
Yeah.
And more.
You know? There's not
anything that we left out,
and, yes, we tried.
