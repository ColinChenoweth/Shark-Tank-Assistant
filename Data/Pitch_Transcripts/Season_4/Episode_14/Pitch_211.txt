My name is Moshe Weiss.
I live in st. Paul, minnesota,
with my wife and three kids.
(children laughing)
Besides being a full-Time
father and husband...
(speaking hebrew)
I'm also a rabbi.
Today we are gonna be
talking about kosher.
Being a rabbi takes faith
and a lot of belief,
and I try to bring that
in my business as well.
What do you think
of my invention?
Great!
We live in
a world of technology,
where everyone is connected.
My product helps people use
that technology better.
They might not even know
that they need it,
but when they use it,
it's gonna be...
(high-Pitched, singsong voice)
Awesome!
My name is rabbi Moshe Weiss.
My product
is the soundbender.
I'm here to offer you guys
26% of my company...
(Robert laughs)
For only $54,000.
Wow.
Uh-huh. A deal.
You might be asking yourself,
what's a rabbi
doing on "Shark tank"?
(laughs)
Well, I'm gonna tell you.
As a rabbi, I'm always
looking to help people
and find solutions
for them.
I'm always trying
to make their "Oy Vey"...
go away.
(laughter)
All right?
So I felt it was
my obligation
to come here today
and ask you for help
in solving
a very real dilemma.
A dilemma...
(laughter)
That, dare I say,
is so rampant,
it could be affecting
over 70 million people
worldwide.
Oy vey.
Oy vey, big time.
(laughter)
So what's this big problem,
right?
Well, I'll tell you.
I love my ipad.
(laughter)
I love it so much.
I watch videos on it.
I play music on it.
I love it.
But since the speaker
is pointing away from me
if I was watching it here,
right?
And you can't grab that sound
and bring it towards your ears,
where you need to hear it.
So I invented my product.
And today, sharks,
I am very proud to present
the solution to
this very great dilemma...
the soundbender.
(laughter)
Magnetic, power-Free
amplifier for your ipad.
It clips right on
to the back magnetically,
beautifully reflecting
the sound right towards you--
Boom--Just like that,
in a snap.
Wow.
All right, check this out.
(klezmer band playing
"Hava nagila")
(laughs)
(Robert) Oy.
Hey, come on.
Rabbis gotta eat, too, right?
(laughs)
Moshe, very good presentation.
Very easy to understand.
Tell us about
those succulent margins
you made reference to.
Um, what would you
like to know?
What are they?
I'd like to know
the numbers.
Well, it costs right now,
without packaging, a dollar.
Including the magnets?
Including the magnets,
my friend.
Okay, and how much
are you selling it for?
$12.99 retail--Manufacturer's
suggested retail price.
$12.99?
Ooh, rabbi.
$12.99, baby.
A higher power is involved.
Moshe, are you
selling it today?
I am.
Do you have sales?
I do have sales.
I've sold 7,000 units
to date.
I've only been selling it
for about six months.
Where are you selling it?
How? Online?
I'm selling them online,
and actually, um,
to a wholesale online...
do you have those
for us to look at?
Yes, I do.
I have several of them.
Which color would you like?
I have pink...
Oh, colors.
White, for sure.
(Robert) Oh.
White?
I'm gonna take red and black.
Stop and go.
Okay.
And I have more, so...
thank you, sir.
Appreciate it.
It's cool. All right.
Thank you.
Moshe, I gotta know--
How did you come up
with the idea?
Oh, man, I'm a teacher,
a rabbi,
at a-a jewish high school
for--for boys
out in minnesota,
and we had to close it down.
You know, the recession just
literally destroyed us.
And somebody gave me
an ipad as a gift,
to lift my spirits.
So I started using it
at night,
and I kept cupping
my hand behind it,
and then I just...
it was like...
it was like--It was like a light
at the end of the tunnel.
And within a week,
I had prototypes.
I-I've been working
with the same manufacturer
in minnesota.
Made in the U.S.A.
And the margins
are still amazing.
It's just been
a really great experience.
I really--I'm here today
to ask for your help
because I'm willing
to work hard.
What do you want
the $54,000 for?
What are you
gonna do with it?
I am going to modify
the mold one more time.
Why? It works great
right now.
It does, but I want it
to work better.
Are you the kind of guy
that wants to keep tinkering
and not sell?
No, absolutely not.
I want to sell and...
make it better
so we can sell more.
Sometimes people
have that disease,
they never stop
trying to make it better.
Yeah, I don't have
that disease.
I'll tell you what--
I have, um, very,
very high interest
from a very large
retail chain.
Um...
who is it?
Walgreens.
Walgreens?
Yeah.
Rabbi, would you be against
licensing your idea
to somebody that could get
overnight distribution
to millions of outlets,
millions of units,
drive your production cost
down to pennies?
I mean, I look
at the accessories market.
It's a $2 billion business.
It's huge.
It's huge.
But it's not made
in kitchen tables.
It's hundreds
of thousands of units
pounded out of a mold
in Asia.
To me, the opportunity here
is to try and convince somebody
to give you 4 cents a unit,
just in a royalty,
and run with it.
That, to me,
is the way I would do it.
But I don't think
I sense that from you.
I'll tell you
very straightforward,
I am not going to license it out
for 4 cents apiece
and bang 'em out
in China.
Okay, rabbi,
I'm out.
I respect that.
Thank you very much.
There's four other sharks.
Let's negotiate, people.
Let's get this done.
Rabbi, I-I think you've got
a nice little business here.
You've got the chutzpah.
(giggles)
but I've gotta make
the determination of my time,
right,
which is very valuable.
If I saw a way to get this
to a $20 million-In-Sales
business,
then it's worth--
I-I just don't see it getting
that big. I really don't.
So for that reason, I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
How would I get
my money back
if I gave you
the money for this product?
I will write you a check.
When?
(laughter)
That's a start.
It couldn't be simpler
than that, Barbara.
I'm suggesting a guarantee
that I get my money back
as you sell.
So you want a royalty?
Well, sort of a royalty, yeah.
I-I think that might be
counterproductive
to what I'm trying
to do.
Why?
So that's off the table?
Because it's
siphoning off cash
while we're
growing the business.
Don't you think
that it would make sense--
No, I don't think
that's a problem.
Well done.
Well done, rabbi.
Okay. I'm out.
(daymond) I can't negotiate
lower money.
So what do you think we need
to negotiate here?
Obviously, you would like
to possibly negotiate
the percentage
of the company?
A-Cha.
How much of the company
would you be willing
to be okay with
for the $54,000,
sticking at that?
I would be happy
with 40%.
The only thing
that is out there
that's making me want
to invest in this company
is the walgreens sale.
Here's my offer,
to clarify--
$54,000, 40%,
and it has to be that
that walgreens sale
is a real deal.
Okay.
That's my offer.
(exhales) Um, Robert?
Would you like to...
you know, Moshe,
you're one of the best
entrepreneurs we've had here.
I mean, you gave us the best
answer anybody's ever given
when we asked
for this royalty stuff.
Doesn't mean
it's the right answer.
It's the right answer.
No, it isn't.
We're not here to suck
the blood out of companies.
At what point do you
ever get your money back?
Moshe, I gave you an offer.
If we're gonna listen
to them too much longer...
right.
'cause you understand,
if he steps out...
right.
My offer starts to change,
because I become more valuable.
Uh, are you going
to make an offer, Robert?
I-I hate to...
Rabbi Moshe has an offer
on the table from daymond,
and Robert is still
considering the investment.
Moshe, I gave you an offer.
Yes.
If we're gonna listen
to them too much longer...
right.
'cause you understand,
if he steps out...
right.
My offer starts to change,
because I become more valuable.
Are you going
to make an offer, Robert?
I-I hate to...
here's the good--
I love the reason
you started this business.
I think you're highly motivated,
I think you did
a fantastic presentation.
Let's do it.
Here's the bad...
(laughs)
Beyond the presentation,
you didn't really tell us
how we're gonna sell it.
You didn't talk about
the distribution channel.
My biggest fear is,
as mark said, is my time.
I don't wanna tell you
how to do this business.
I want to support you.
I know
what has to be done.
I'm not sitting
on my hands going,
(yiddish accent) "oy gevalt,
I don't know what to do."
(laughter)
"what am I gonna do? Hey."
You know,
I can sit at home
and I can relax and I can
make a nice living
and sell my soundbenders
a thousand at a time
on the internet-Schminternet.
Yeah!
Schminternet.
Whatever, whatever.
(normal voice) I know how
to do this business.
I need your connections.
That's what I need.
I'd like to make an offer.
Okay.
I'd like to hear
your answer on Daymond's offer.
I'm gonna give you
ten seconds to think about it.
After that, I'm dropping out.
I'll give you the $54,000.
Same amount. 40%.
I'm gonna take you at your word
that the walgreens order's
there.
Same offer as daymond.
So let's summarize--
Both offers are for
the same amount of equity, 40%,
for the same amount
of dollars--$54,000.
One has a contingency,
the other doesn't.
What are you going
to do?
Daymond, we have a deal.
My man.
Congratulations.
All right.
We got a deal. We got a deal,
and we're gonna make money.
You're gonna
really help me.
I just wanted to see
if you could
close walgreens.
Really, you're...
other than that...
you're really
an awesome person.
It's gonna close.
I got it.
We'll get it done.
Adios.
(laughs)
Is "Adios" Yiddish?
(Barbara) No.
(laughter)
I chose daymond because
he is a marketing genius.
He's--he's built his company
from one product
to millions of products sold,
and, um, I really have
a lot of respect for him,
and I think he got that.
