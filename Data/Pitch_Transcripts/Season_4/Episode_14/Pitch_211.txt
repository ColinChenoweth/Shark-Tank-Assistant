My name is Moshe Weiss.
I'm also a rabbi.
Today we are gonna be
talking about kosher.
My name is rabbi Moshe Weiss.
My product
is the soundbender.
I'm here to offer you guys
26% of my company...
(Robert laughs)
For only $54,000.
Wow.
Uh-huh. A deal.
You might be asking yourself,
what's a rabbi
doing on "Shark tank"?
(laughs)
Well, I'm gonna tell you.
As a rabbi, I'm always
looking to help people
Hey, come on.
Rabbis gotta eat, too, right?
(laughs)
$12.99?
Ooh, rabbi.
$12.99, baby.
A higher power is involved.
Moshe, are you
selling it today?
I am.
Do you have sales?
I do have sales.
I've sold 7,000 units
to date.
I've only been selling it
for about six months.
Where are you selling it?
How? Online?
I'm selling them online,
Moshe, I gotta know--
How did you come up
with the idea?
Oh, man, I'm a teacher,
a rabbi,
at a-a jewish high school
for--for boys
Rabbi, would you be against
licensing your idea
to somebody that could get
overnight distribution
to millions of outlets,
millions of units,
drive your production cost
down to pennies?
I mean, I look
at the accessories market.
It's a $2 billion business.
It's huge.
It's huge.
But it's not made
in kitchen tables.
Rabbi, I-I think you've got
a nice little business here.
You've got the chutzpah.
(giggles)
but I've gotta make
the determination of my time,
right,
which is very valuable.
If I saw a way to get this
to a $20 million-In-Sales
business,
then it's worth--
I-I just don't see it getting
that big. I really don't.
So for that reason, I'm out.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
How would I get
my money back
if I gave you
the money for this product?
I will write you a check.
When?
(laughter)
That's a start.
It couldn't be simpler
than that, Barbara.
I'm suggesting a guarantee
that I get my money back
as you sell.
So you want a royalty?
Well, sort of a royalty, yeah.
I-I think that might be
counterproductive
to what I'm trying
to do.
Why?
So that's off the table?
Because it's
siphoning off cash
while we're
growing the business.
Don't you think
that it would make sense--
No, I don't think
that's a problem.
Well done.
Well done, rabbi.
Okay. I'm out.
(daymond) I can't negotiate
lower money.
So what do you think we need
to negotiate here?
Obviously, you would like
to possibly negotiate
the percentage
of the company?
A-Cha.
How much of the company
would you be willing
to be okay with
for the $54,000,
sticking at that?
I would be happy
with 40%.
The only thing
that is out there
that's making me want
to invest in this company
is the walgreens sale.
Here's my offer,
to clarify--
$54,000, 40%,
you know, Moshe,
you're one of the best
entrepreneurs we've had here.
I mean, you gave us the best
answer anybody's ever given
when we asked
for this royalty stuff.
Doesn't mean
it's the right answer.
It's the right answer.
No, it isn't.
We're not here to suck
the blood out of companies.
At what point do you
ever get your money back?
Moshe, I gave you an offer.
If we're gonna listen
to them too much longer...
Rabbi Moshe has an offer
on the table from daymond,
Moshe, I gave you an offer.
Yes.
If we're gonna listen
to them too much longer...
