Hi, sharks.
My name is Susie Taylor,
Hi, sharks.
My name is Steve Taylor.
Our company is bibbitec,
was Susie spending
our hard-Earned money
on bibs that just
didn't work.
So I pleaded with her,
"Susie, if they don't work,
please, don't buy them."
(laughs)
(laughs) okay.
So I stopped buying them,
(Susie) What's great about
this american-Made,
nontoxic fabric
is that it never stains,
never smells,
(Steve) sure.
Oh, sure.
Susie, it didn't leave
a stain or anything on it?
It's just a little bit
of moisture from the wipe,
I will--
No way, Susie.
Okay, you don't notice it,
but you will throw away more
bibs than you can ever imagine.
How many have you sold?
We've sold about 2,000.
Over the four years?
Yes. Little under
four years.
What did you sell
in the last 12 months?
In the last 12 months,
uh, we are
at about 17,000,
uh, dollars in sales.
That's it?
The majority of bibs
are not bought online, guys.
Let's face it, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Millions of bibs
go out every year.
There's two or three
large-Box retailers
that sell baby apparel
like this.
Why are you not in retail?
Can I tell you why?
Yes, please do.
Okay. They said
it's a hard sell
because it's an education.
I have to explain
this bib actually works.
Ah.
Right.
They confirmed
that their bibs are bait.
They're used to get
the mom into the store
to buy the bib,
Susie, it's a Hobby.
It's not a business.
Well...
the numbers,
well, it start--
they're talking,
I'm listening.
Okay.
They're saying,
"Mr. Wonderful,
we're not selling very many,
cause they're too expensive."
I disagree. We have sold them
for all different prices.
The price is...
it really wasn't an issue.
The education of the product
is the issue.
I have no business experience.
I need you guys to blow me up.
Here's my challenge--
I actually think
it's a great product.
Thank you very much.
Instead of trying to sell it,
have you tried licensing it
to somebody
who already makes bibs?
Well, when I went
to the big box stores,
they all wanted me to go
to--to China.
They wanted me
to drag it down.
They wanted to sell it
for $19.99.
For me, the stuff
that I bought from China,
the toxins
that my kids were sucking on,
I couldn't morally do that.
I want to make it
so that people believe
that America can make products
that are great for our kids.
America can make products,
but your cost is keeping this
away from America.
But we're making
a mark--
You're hurting children
that don't get near it
because they can't afford it.
Well, our margins are large.
No. No. They're horrible.
They're terrible.
Margins are terrible.
Susie, you're making 'em
for $15,
you're selling 'em
for $24 on your web site.
Well...
How is that a good margin?
Robert, if I may,
whenever we get in front
of moms at trade shows...
it just...
Steve, how long are you
going to lose money
every month doing this?
(sighs)
If we don't get
an investor,
I have a certain amount of money
I'm gonna put in,
that I'm willing
to put in.
How much more money
will you put in?
I think--
That we can afford,
personally?
We can't.
We can't afford any more.
So, Susie,
is it time to take the bib
So, Susie,
is it time to take the bib
Steve, that's not
your problem.
Sorry, Susie.
You're not selling more
because you're a mom?
No! Because
I don't have more time.
I'm just myself.
(lowered voice)
Deep breath. Deep breath.
We haven't gotten the message
out to all the mothers.
Susie, you've been
doing it for four years.
Susie, why are you
getting emotional
about this right now?
I'm a stay-at-Home mom,
trying to do my best,
really trying
to raise the kids
the way I was
"supposed" to raise the kids.
Steve, are you saying
you can run in Those?
Uh, not only can you,
I'm a masters
all-American sprinter,
so I'm one of the fastest
50-year-Olds in America.
Really?
You can run in these?
That shoe that you have
was designed by a guy
who runs 50-Mile ultra marathons
on a regular basis.
We designed our first
custom-Made xero shoe pendant.
Kevin, I want to start with you
just to see
what you think of it.
Thank you very much.
Oh, that's
extremely attractive.
(laughs)
I had a hunch
you might like it.
Yes, I do.
They've somehow captured
the essence of an athlete.
Robert, since you have
this skeptical tone
in your voice...
(Barbara laughs)
why don't you come up,
if you want to,
It's more than that.
Steve, I promise you that
I can have these on the boat
in about 30 days.
Oh, I would
challenge you for that one.
You want to challenge me?
You cut a piece of rubber,
put a string on it,
Steve, were you a shoe guy?
No, no, no.
Like, how do you
wake up one day
Steve,
I would love to try it.
Sure.
But $400,000, giving
the company a $5 million value,
man, I can't try
for that price.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You have an offer
from somebody that's rational.
It's True.
