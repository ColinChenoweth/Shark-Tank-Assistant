First into the tank
are Susie and Steve Taylor,
who believe they've created
a better version
of something all babies need.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Susie Taylor,
and this is my husband.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Steve Taylor.
Our company is bibbitec,
and we're here today
seeking $40,000
for a 14% stake
in our company.
As a parent
of two messy little boys,
we often found ourselves
in messy situations.
And what drove me insane
was Susie spending
our hard-Earned money
on bibs that just
didn't work.
So I pleaded with her,
"Susie, if they don't work,
please, don't buy them."
(laughs)
(laughs) okay.
So I stopped buying them,
and I decided
to solve the problem myself.
Introducing...
? ta-Da ?
bibbitec.
The best thing
about the bibbitec bib
is the design.
It simply fits
over the child's arm
and slips over their head
and comfortably covers
their entire body.
(Susie) What's great about
this american-Made,
nontoxic fabric
is that it never stains,
never smells,
and never holds an odor.
It's too good to be True,
I know.
You wanna give 'em
a closer look?
Take a closer look, sharks?
Yeah.
I was hoping to see
the dirty one.
Could we have a look
at the dirty one?
(Steve) sure.
Oh, sure.
Susie, it didn't leave
a stain or anything on it?
It's just a little bit
of moisture from the wipe,
and it's gonna dry
with the air.
It's like fitness material.
Is this neoprene?
It's a poly-Nylon blend.
It's patented.
It's nontoxic certified.
It's comfortable.
The kids love to wear it.
What do you sell it for?
We are selling it right now,
direct to consumer,
on our web site, for $24.99.
What does it cost you
to make it?
Currently, our price
is $15 per bib.
Oh! Oh.
Oh, that's crazy.
Whoa.
That's brutal.
Holy cow!
But it is also selling
in catalogs online for $48.
Why is it $15 to make it?
Because This is
the Mack daddy material.
You can't make money
selling bibs to America
at a really high price.
It's cheaper to just
buy a bunch of bibs,
and throw them out
after they get dirty.
Absolutely not,
Mr. Wonderful.
This is one bib
that will last you
four years, even longer.
Once you look at what mothers
are buying on bibs...
what they're spending
a year--$400.
No. No way.
(Barbara) No way.
I will--
No way, Susie.
Okay, you don't notice it,
but you will throw away more
bibs than you can ever imagine.
How many have you sold?
We've sold about 2,000.
Over the four years?
Yes. Little under
four years.
What did you sell
in the last 12 months?
In the last 12 months,
uh, we are
at about 17,000,
uh, dollars in sales.
That's it?
The majority of bibs
are not bought online, guys.
Let's face it, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Millions of bibs
go out every year.
There's two or three
large-Box retailers
that sell baby apparel
like this.
Why are you not in retail?
Can I tell you why?
Yes, please do.
Okay. They said
it's a hard sell
because it's an education.
I have to explain
this bib actually works.
Ah.
Right.
They confirmed
that their bibs are bait.
They're used to get
the mom into the store
to buy the bib,
and the orange juice
and everything else...
But, Susie,
honey, sweetie, poopsie,
that's what I'm talking about.
I know, and--
It's too expensive.
No, it's not.
We have found that it has sold
at $48 without a question.
People are... I'm not...
$48? Insane.
It's ins--I could get
a whole outfit.
Of course. That's why
I pulled out of it.
And I feel retail
is obnoxious.
Susie, it's a Hobby.
It's not a business.
Well...
the numbers,
well, it start--
they're talking,
I'm listening.
Okay.
They're saying,
"Mr. Wonderful,
we're not selling very many,
cause they're too expensive."
I disagree. We have sold them
for all different prices.
The price is...
it really wasn't an issue.
The education of the product
is the issue.
I have no business experience.
I need you guys to blow me up.
Here's my challenge--
I actually think
it's a great product.
Thank you very much.
Instead of trying to sell it,
have you tried licensing it
to somebody
who already makes bibs?
Well, when I went
to the big box stores,
they all wanted me to go
to--to China.
They wanted me
to drag it down.
They wanted to sell it
for $19.99.
For me, the stuff
that I bought from China,
the toxins
that my kids were sucking on,
I couldn't morally do that.
I want to make it
so that people believe
that America can make products
that are great for our kids.
America can make products,
but your cost is keeping this
away from America.
But we're making
a mark--
You're hurting children
that don't get near it
because they can't afford it.
Well, our margins are large.
No. No. They're horrible.
They're terrible.
Margins are terrible.
Susie, you're making 'em
for $15,
you're selling 'em
for $24 on your web site.
Well...
How is that a good margin?
Robert, if I may,
whenever we get in front
of moms at trade shows...
it just...
if flies out.
When they see it...
and people flock around...
it flies out.
And they freak out.
Because they are
starting to realize
that they're buying stuff
from China, and it's breaking.
Are you making
any money doing this?
No.
We've invested over--
at the end of the four years,
about $75,000.
And you haven't made
any return
on that investment yet?
No.
What we feel
the value of our company is--
that we've been
out there to mothers,
we know
they love the product.
Steve, how long are you
going to lose money
every month doing this?
(sighs)
If we don't get
an investor,
I have a certain amount of money
I'm gonna put in,
that I'm willing
to put in.
How much more money
will you put in?
I think--
That we can afford,
personally?
We can't.
We can't afford any more.
So, Susie,
is it time to take the bib
behind the barn
and shoot it?
(gun cocks)
So, Susie,
is it time to take the bib
behind the barn
and shoot it?
Absolutely not.
Can you get the price
of this bib down in America?
Yes. No question.
I think we can. If we have
a large order, we can.
Daymond, you gotta
make it for 2 bucks,
like every other bib's
made for.
What is the magic price point
to sell it at, retail-Wise?
We feel this one
can sell for $19.99.
We feel the larger one,
we feel a good price point
is either $24.99
or $29.99.
(daymond) Okay--
This is the first bib
they look at.
All right. So the $19.99 one
you have to manufacture
for $5.
(Kevin) That'll never happen.
We'd--We'd have to...
I...
get a different,
uh, material,
and we're open
for that.
(sighs heavily)
Steve, that's not
your problem.
Your problem is,
how do you sell many thousands?
And I don't think
you're doing a good job today
of explaining that.
'cause it's
too expensive, Robert.
Okay, well, let me ask you.
Susie, are you not
selling thousands
because it's too expensive?
No, I'm not
selling thousands--
So why are you not
selling thousands?
Because I'm just--
I'm a mom. My kids come first.
Sorry, Susie.
You're not selling more
because you're a mom?
No! Because
I don't have more time.
I'm just myself.
(lowered voice)
Deep breath. Deep breath.
We haven't gotten the message
out to all the mothers.
Susie, you've been
doing it for four years.
Susie, why are you
getting emotional
about this right now?
I'm a stay-at-Home mom,
trying to do my best,
really trying
to raise the kids
the way I was
"supposed" to raise the kids.
And Stephen was trying
to run a business.
And we would have
these fights over finances.
And one day,
we're on a-a road trip,
and he's asking about
the credit card bills.
And I'm trying
to explain to him
what the things are
that we need.
And there were a lot of bibs.
I know it's crazy,
but there were a lot of bibs.
And he's like, "where are they?"
and I'm like,
"They're in the garbage."
He's like, "suse,
that's hard-Earned money
you're throwing away."
(pats hands)
I'm like,
"But they don't work."
And I feel like it's--It's
like an endless pit of moms.
We're sitting here
trying to do our best
with products
that aren't working,
and that's where
the passion comes from.
I'm--I'm heartbroken.
Do you think
we're not astute investors?
W--Wait a second.
We're looking at it
from the side that matters--
the money.
You're not making any.
You're losing your family's
money every month.
Do you think
any investor up here
wants to join you
in that madness?
We don't have
your connections.
Money's binary--Either you
make it, or you lose it.
There's a tipping point,
okay?
We are at
that tipping point.
To say that
we haven't made money...
and my question be--
has been...
it's not fair
to say we'll never make it.
When? When? When?
Right now!
Okay. Guys, guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys.
With one of you,
or all of you.
There's no point.
It's like--
right.
It's like arguing with--
With... a wall.
Here's my perspective--
I like the product.
Thank you.
I don't think
you need to sell it retail.
I don't have a problem
with the price point.
Thank you.
I think there's
a large enough market there.
What I do have
a problem with is,
you're not
the right person to run it.
You're the exact
wrong person to run it.
Go find a college kid
who knows internet marketing,
and takes it out to all
the different moms' groups.
Cost you $25,000, $30,000
for that person to do it.
It's not about connections.
I'm not the right solution.
It's out there for you.
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Um, I agree
with mark's very good idea,
and that's easily done.
But I also think you have
a ready-Made
mom sales force out there.
I think you could get
a legion of moms
believing as fervently
as you do in the product,
which is so obvious.
And I think you could
very inexpensively
get your product out there
where it belongs,
and I don't think
it's retail.
That's a great idea.
Thank you. Thank you.
My instincts
Have always served me well,
so on this one,
I'm out.
They've lied to you.
They are giving you
encouragement where there's
none, and I'm disgusted.
I'm out.
Daymond, Robert, any...
the challenge
I'm having here is that
in most businesses,
the problem
is the education.
I can't help you
educate people about bibs.
I'm out.
I hear a lot
of confusing strategies
on how to sell it.
What I've learned is,
you gotta follow the money.
I don't think
you have a clear plan
on how to make this successful.
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I don't think I'm ever
gonna give up.
Moms need better products,
and I'm gonna
give it to them.
Steve, are you saying
you can run in Those?
Uh, not only can you,
I'm a masters
all-American sprinter,
so I'm one of the fastest
50-year-Olds in America.
Really?
You can run in these?
That shoe that you have
was designed by a guy
who runs 50-Mile ultra marathons
on a regular basis.
We designed our first
custom-Made xero shoe pendant.
Kevin, I want to start with you
just to see
what you think of it.
Thank you very much.
Oh, that's
extremely attractive.
(laughs)
I had a hunch
you might like it.
Yes, I do.
They've somehow captured
the essence of an athlete.
Robert, since you have
this skeptical tone
in your voice...
(Barbara laughs)
why don't you come up,
if you want to,
join us, and you can
actually experience it.
'cause feeling
xero Shoes is one thing,
But wearing them--
That's a whole different story.
Plus I'm the only
runner up here.
So what I'm gonna do is,
on one foot, I'm gonna
give you our 4mm connect.
This is the closest thing
there is to Barefoot
plus a layer of protection.
And on the other foot,
I'm gonna do our 6mm contact,
gives you
a little smoother ride,
little--for people who want
a little extra cushion.
And are they custom-Made?
We sell them
in two different ways--
Either as
a do-It-Yourself kit
that you can trim down
to your unique foot shape,
um, or we can
custom-Make them for you.
There's, like,
nothing to it.
Yeah. Well...
it doesn't feel like
you've got anything on.
You don't need
a lot of support.
Putting your foot in support
is like putting
your feet in a cast
and expecting them
to get stronger.
So when you walk
across our fake world...
(daymond) Robert...
and get to feel
the world...
Wait, let me
light the coals first.
(laughter)
Ouch, ouch.
The one on your left
is the closest to Barefoot,
the one on your right gives you
a little smoother ride.
It's like getting
a little foot massage, yeah?
Ye--Oh, yeah.
Okay, Well, rob,
how do you feel?
I gotta tell you,
they feel great.
(laughs)
No, seriously, I know
they look weird, but...
(daymond) So I don't want
to state the obvious,
but you basically come over here
with some rubber and a string
and you said it's worth
$5 million.
That's correct.
Um, why do you feel that?
We started this business
two and a half years ago.
Uh, with just a web site.
No advertising.
And since that time,
we've sold over $650,000
of our do-It-Yourself
sandal kits
and custom-Made...
in two years?
In two and a half years.
In two and a half years.
The last 2 months, we've done
a little over $130,000.
Just alone, so...
So things are
going like this.
This year we're on track
for about $1.2 million.
Yeah.
On the $1.2 million, if you
hit it this year in sales,
what will your profits be?
We're projecting
$200,000 for this year.
What's it cost to make?
What's it cost to sell?
What we sell the most of is
our 4mm, uh, do-It-yourself kit,
which retails for $24.95.
Our cost of materials
is $3.11.
What do you wholesale it for?
Uh, $12.97.
And what percent
is sold through Retail
or other distribution,
and what percent
is sold through your web site?
Over 90% is sold--
Sold through our web site.
We are just starting,
uh, in retail.
We've got nine
retail locations currently.
Six of them
have already reordered.
(Robert) tell you, to me,
I open it up,
and it looks like
just a plain piece of plastic.
Like a broken sneaker.
Yeah.
(laughter)
(Kevin) You're gonna
make $200,000
if everything goes right
this year.
You're asking me to pay you
25 times that amount
and value your business
at 25 times profit.
That's correct.
But here's the other problem
I've got--
If this category is growing
as fast as you say...
right.
It's going to attract some very
big competitors at some point.
Yeah.
And will look down at this
and say,
"Mm. Piece of rubber.
Piece of string."
Right.
"I can do the same thing
"And put my distribution power
behind it
and crush
these cockroaches."
Well, first of all,
we do have a design patent,
uh, pending on these.
But it's a piece of rubber
and a string.
It's more than that.
Steve, I promise you that
I can have these on the boat
in about 30 days.
Oh, I would
challenge you for that one.
You want to challenge me?
You cut a piece of rubber,
put a string on it,
and you said that This is
great technology.
And then you say
the company's worth $5 million,
and you've only done...
no, we say the company's
worth $5 million
because of
our industry experts.
Because of what?
The industry?
I'm out.
Steve, were you a shoe guy?
No, no, no.
Like, how do you
wake up one day
and say,
"I'm gonna make..."
hold that thought.
The tarahumara indians
in mexico--
They did
their own version of this.
I mean, this is, again,
a 15,000-year-Old idea.
This is...
the tarahumara indians
in mexico
are a people
who are known for running
50, 60, 70 miles at a stretch
wearing nothing But sandals
made out of scraps of tire
and bits of leather.
Look, it's a huge
leap of faith.
I believe
your whole granola story,
and the indians
running around
in the desert
and all that stuff.
(laughs)
But on the other hand,
it's a crapshoot.
I'll--I'll make you an offer
just for the Heck of it.
I'll give you
the $400,000 for 50%.
Okay.
You're worth about
800 grand, that's it.
Okay. Thank you.
We'll come back to you on that.
So back to some--
Wait, you need
to come back to him on that?
Oh, well, it's not an offer
that I would take
right off the bat.
We value the equity much higher
than that at this point.
Well, I know that, but that's
why you're in the shark tank.
True.
You're here for money.
I'm a rational investor.
You people are probably
delusional entrepreneurs.
Perhaps.
And somewhere in the middle
is reality.
Okay, uh, first off,
you give me a headache.
I don't know why.
Oh, sorry.
You remind me
of my first husband.
You're a little Shorter,
but there's a similarity.
(laughs)
and there's two things
driving me crazy--
One is,
it's a black sole...
well...
Which is hot.
Secondly, it's got
a knot on the bottom.
I would think
it would be uncomfortable,
and that's a liability,
all right?
So I'm not crazy
about the product.
I have to be honest.
I'm out.
I love this stuff.
I'm a big runner.
I'm getting old,
my knees hurt,
I've tried everything.
This would be
the thing to try.
Steve,
I would love to try it.
Sure.
But $400,000, giving
the company a $5 million value,
man, I can't try
for that price.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You have an offer
from somebody that's rational.
It's True.
And I don't have
a shoe company in my portfolio.
And I think your story--
I'm listening to it,
it's got a shtick, and it's
a--really a marketing strategy.
Yeah.
You've got rubber
and string.
Yeah.
And I'm willing to say
it's worth $800,000.
I'd give you $400,000 for 50%.
It's a clean deal.
50% is way beyond
what we're willing to do.
What's your counter?
Uh, my counter would be 10%.
You're out of your mind.
One of the other companies
that's also in this space
recently, uh, got $10 million
for 25% of their company
based on the--a multiple
of their projections
for the following year.
First of all, because
one of your competitors
got someone to put money in
at a ridiculous valuation
doesn't make that
a comp for you guys.
It just means you're competing
against someone
that's got
stupid money behind them.
Do you know what they call
a bunch of investors
rushing into a hot area,
like you've mentioned,
with all these
other investors?
They call it a bubble.
And no one's a bigger expert
at getting out of a bubble
at the right time
than I am,
so I'm telling you,
you should take Kevin's deal,
because your bubble
is going to pop.
I'm out.
Okay. There are no other
sharks here.
Correct.
