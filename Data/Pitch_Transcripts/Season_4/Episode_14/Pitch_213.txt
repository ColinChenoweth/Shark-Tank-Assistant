I'm Mike Robinson,
C.E.O. Of cuddletunes.
We're seeking $400,000
for a 20% stake in the company.
(Mike) Hi, Mia, sweetheart.
Tonight I'm gonna
tell you a new story.
Once upon a time,
there were
three caterpillars...
in addition
to your recorded voice,
cuddletunes plays mp3 music...
(Click, narration stops)
Which can be personalized
with the child's name.
(woman) ? Hush, little Mia ?
? don't make a peep ?
as you can hear,
the sound quality is terrific,
Mike, how do I hook up
the bear to the internet?
It's got--in the back
is the mp3 player,
about this idea.
Mike...
Yeah?
My--My only pet peeve,
I'll tell you,
is I-I hate when people
value their time...
Mm-hmm.
When they're starting
a start-up.
That--That's your cost.
That's an opportunity cost...
Absolutely. Yeah.
Not my cost.
So I--
I'm not asking you to--
I'm not asking you
to pay me for that time.
But you did say--
You did say--
I'm just asking you
to recognize
that that's the value
of the business.
So you--You've put
a $2 million valuation
on this business
right now.
Yes.
Are you saying you've got
sales to support that,
or just your time?
If you don't mind,
I'd like to come back to that.
Well, generally, that means
you have no sales.
(Robert chuckles)
Mike, when somebody doesn't
answer the sales question,
usually, all of us
get really uncomfortable.
Well, let me ask you this--
So we launched this thing,
did no marketing,
Mike, when I was a kid,
we had ten kids in our family,
Mike, I'm just
trying to be clear--
I can record my voice
to my kids
within a stuffed animal.
What's your distinct advantage?
Mike, I just don't
see anything unique here.
I don't think that being able
to record to the cloud
is anything
significantly differentiated.
(rips)
I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, mark.
Mike, I don't think
your being able to update
is that big a deal.
I'm out.
Okay, thanks, Robert.
So, um...
if I invested my money
in this,
I'd sleep like a baby.
I'd wake up
every two hours, crying,
Yes, Mike?
The power of this product
is in the emotional proposition.
