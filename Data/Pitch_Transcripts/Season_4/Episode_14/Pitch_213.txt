This is my daughter Mia's bear.
(Click)
(Mike) Hi, Mia, sweetheart.
Tonight I'm gonna
tell you a new story.
Once upon a time,
there were
three caterpillars...
in addition
to your recorded voice,
cuddletunes plays mp3 music...
(Click, narration stops)
Which can be personalized
with the child's name.
(woman) ? Hush, little Mia ?
? don't make a peep ?
as you can hear,
the sound quality is terrific,
and it's incredibly
simple to operate.
Through our easy-to-Use

Prayers, stories, songs,
Loving messages,

all of that on their bear,
whenever they need it.
Sharks, with over $1 million
in development behind us,
the product and service
are ready to go.
And I need your help
to scale this up
into a global family brand.
Can I offer you a bear?
Did you say you spent a million
dollars in development?
Allowing for the three years'
effort, yes.
What do you mean, "allowing
for the three years"?
paying yourself
for the effort?
What does that mean?
What's that?
What does that mean?
Yeah, valuing my time
at a big discount...
Ah.
Actually, compared
to what I--
How much money
have you actually
put into the business?
In terms of cash?
Yeah.
Uh, about half a million.
Wow.
(woman singing indistinctly)
Mike, how do I hook up
the bear to the internet?
It's got--in the back
is the mp3 player,
and it has a usb connection.
So you plug it
into your computer,
and just like you sync
an ipod to itunes,
you sync a cuddletunes bear
to cuddletunes.
It's a very simple process.
You don't even have to
install any software.
What do you value
your time at?
I was making $300,000 a year
as a public company C.E.O.
What company
were you c.E.O. Of?
It was called
citel technologies.
It was a voice over I.P. Company
in the U.K.,
and I took it public
on the London exchange in 2006.
And what happened
to that company?
Did you leave, or...
Uh, about a year and a half
after the I.P.O.,
um, the board and I...
had different visions.
So they fired you.
No, they offered me
a deal.
And, uh, I had already been
talking to some friends
about this idea.
Mike...
Yeah?
My--My only pet peeve,
I'll tell you,
is I-I hate when people
value their time...
Mm-hmm.
When they're starting
a start-up.
That--That's your cost.
That's an opportunity cost...
Absolutely. Yeah.
Not my cost.
So I--
I'm not asking you to--
I'm not asking you
to pay me for that time.
But you did say--
You did say--
I'm just asking you
to recognize
that that's the value
of the business.
So you--You've put
a $2 million valuation
on this business
right now.
Yes.
Are you saying you've got
sales to support that,
or just your time?
If you don't mind,
I'd like to come back to that.
Well, generally, that means
you have no sales.
(Robert chuckles)
Always a bad answer.
First I'd like you
to understand--
Mike, when somebody doesn't
answer the sales question,
usually, all of us
get really uncomfortable.
Well, let me ask you this--
So we launched this thing,
did no marketing,
and then 32,000 people
have been to the site.
How many units
do you think we would have sold?
I would think 5% of them
would have bought it.
Yeah. It's 9 1/2%.
Over 3,000 units sold.
Ooh.
It's brought in
about $90,000.
Has that been consistent
every month, 9% conversion?
It depends on where
the traffic comes from.
So a good deal of that
has come from deals
that we've run
with livingsocial and groupon,
where we didn't
have to pay any marketing...
Oh, that--Okay,
that just kills
the whole
conversion percentage.
(daymond) Yeah.
That's just
a discount mechanism,
and they do
all the promoting.
It's not your site
doing the promoting.
Right. Well, that's the point,
is that somebody else
went out there
and spent their money
to tell somebody about this
and present them
with an offer.
But this is what they do.
Groupon--
That's what they do.
They do that to everybody.
It's their job.
They... right.
What did you make per bear
on a groupon deal?
We're only at about
20% margin on that.
And you gave them
a discount?
Yes, the consumer
gets a discount.
What did you present
the retail as,
what did you sell it
through the deal company,
and what are your costs
for this?
The--the bear itself
is $39.95.
That's the retail price?
Yes.
And then people pay
an EXTRA 20 bucks
for personalized music
and a year of unlimited
recording and downloads.
So the bundle is 60 bucks.
How much did groupon
and livingsocial sell it for
to their customers?
Their usual, half off.
If you just
kept that model,
you wouldn't have
a sustainable business,
because your margins
are only 20%.
Right, but of course, I'm not
gonna keep that model.
Mike, when I was a kid,
we had ten kids in our family,
so my dad sang and played
the guitar to us every night.
Right.
And he came up
with the genius idea
of recording his voice
and all of his songs.
Yeah.
We all had
a funny reaction to it.
Really?
We all felt so sad,
because my dad wasn't there
doing it for us.
Interesting.
So it was kind of
a freaky experience.
Hmm.
And it was eliminated
in our household
probably within a month.
Yeah.
So I don't think
This is gonna work.
I'm out.
Thank you
for your time.
Mike, I'm just
trying to be clear--
I can record my voice
to my kids
within a stuffed animal.
What's your distinct advantage?
And you can send it to them
from anywhere in the world.
So not only you,
But the grandparents
that don't live nearby
can be doing it.
You can be updating
stuff continually,
you can...
so the only advantage is,
I can attach yours
to the internet and update it?
Correct, which means
you don't have to be there
to put your voice on it.
Mike, I just don't
see anything unique here.
I don't think that being able
to record to the cloud
is anything
significantly differentiated.
(rips)
I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, mark.
Mike, I don't think
your being able to update
is that big a deal.
I'm out.
Okay, thanks, Robert.
So, um...
if I invested my money
in this,
I'd sleep like a baby.
I'd wake up
every two hours, crying,
and asking my mommy,
"where's my money?"
I'm out.
So, Kevin...
Yes, Mike?
The power of this product
is in the emotional proposition.
And what's missing
in your presentation--
I'm not even gonna fight you
on valuation at this point,
because it wouldn't matter
if you're asking
for a $2 million value or 10.
You don't know what
your customer acquisition Cost
is going to be in a sustained
model. You just don't.
Right.
There's no way I would
give you $400,000.
I'm out.
Thanks for your time.
Good luck.
Okay.
Good luck.
Don't trust him as far
as I could throw him.
As I could throw him.
He looked at us
like one big honey pot.
I know. He's so slick.
I think this thing
is foaming at the mouth.
(laughter)
