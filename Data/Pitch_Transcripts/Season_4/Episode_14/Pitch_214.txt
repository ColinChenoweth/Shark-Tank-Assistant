I'm Steven sashen, and this is
my beautiful Wife Lena Phoenix.
And we live
in Boulder, colorado.
Some people think boulder
is just a bunch of aging,
long-Haired hippie athletes.
And they're right, and we are
their spokespeople. (laughs)
I'm a competitive sprinter,
so when I got back
into sprinting
after a 30-year break,
I was injured constantly,
and a friend suggested
that taking off my shoes
might be a cure.
So I did, and it was.
And I've been basically
Barefoot ever since.
This new Hobby of mine
inspired our new business,
and we haven't looked back.
Our product
is kind of deceptive
in that it looks
really simple,
but it's actually
part of a revolution.
We want to change the world.
So we're hoping the sharks
will really understand
what the power of this is.
We have pretty much
given up our entire lives
for this product for the last
two and a half years.
If we don't get an investment
from the sharks,
we're gonna be exactly
where we are right now--
In over our heads
with a great product
that we don't know how
to get out into the world
while our inferior competitors
just run right past us.
Hi. I'm Lena Phoenix, and I am
the owner of xero shoes.
And I'm Steven sashen.
I'm the C.E.O.
We're looking for $400,000
in exchange for
8% equity in our company.
Wow.
40 years after the invention
of the heavily padded,
very expensive running shoe,
research is showing
how just your feet,
without all the bells
and whistles,
can do a better job.
But Barefoot
is not always appropriate.
That's why I developed
xero shoes
original barefootware.
Xero shoes
are a high-Tech version
of mankind's favorite footwear
since 15,000 B.C.
(Lena) Xero shoes
are the only footwear
that have been shown
in Independent university study
to be biomechanically
identical to Barefoot
plus a layer of protection.
Xero shoes let you
express your personality
with styles that range from
high-Performance ultra-Minimal
to night-on-the-Town
fashion-Forward.
(Lena)
They're also super lightweight,
way more comfortable
than flip-Flops,
and unlike some other
Barefoot shoes,
they never smell.
Now before you jump
out of your chairs
and rush the table to get
your hands and feet on a pair,
Lena will do
her best Vanna white
and deliver some.
(chuckles)
There's just you, me, Lena,
the rubber, and the string.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna give you $400,000
for 50% of this company.
That's an offer we're not
willing to take at this time.
Very well.
You're dead to me.
Run out of here
in bare feet.
(laughter)
(daymond) Thank you, guys.
Thank you for your time.
Thanks. Pleasure. Thanks.
Now that we're dead to Kevin,
we're gonna have to show him
that he made the wrong decision.
We have so many people
who love our product
and have experienced
Real benefits from it.
We know that this is something
that there's a real market for,
and we're just gonna continue
to do what we do.
