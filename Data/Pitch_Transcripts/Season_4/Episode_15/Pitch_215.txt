So I'm gonna give you
ten seconds, Chris.
Before you do that--
I am not gonna let
this price go up.
Oh, he's pulling
an old Mark Cuban.
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
I absolutely hate
to see young entrepreneurs
Getting completely screwed.
It's sink...
What is it
we don't know yet?
Or swim.
You just got on board
as an opportunist.
She's not stupid.
I think they call me
a mini shark.
Who are the sharks?
In season 2,
Rebecca Rescate pitched
her cat toilet training system
citikitty...
you take the citikitty training
seat that you see there,
you put it on your toilet,
Hello, sharks. I'm Chris.
(Kevin) Hey, Rebecca,
you had...
(Rebecca) You know what?
Let--Let's call it
like it is.
You had a Winner in
the cat, uh, poo-poo dome thing.
There was no question
about it.
Citikitty is doing fantastic.
We're gonna reach
about $5 million in sales
this coming year.
$5 million?!
Good for you.
Did you invent this?
Chris is the inventor
of this product.
Chris--Christopher, how did you
come up with it?
I invented Hoodie Pillow
After bringing my triplet girls
home from the hospital.
Our lives were turned
upside down,
our sleep schedules were
completely taken away from us,
I've known Rebecca
for a few years,
So, Rebecca, you have a knack
for crazy-looking stuff.
Yes.
But you were right last time.
I gotta tell you,
when you came out here,
I thought it was the most
ridiculous thing I'd ever seen,
(Robert) I know why she's here.
(Rebecca) It's different.
Because "Shark tank" made
citikitty a $5 million product.
She's not stupid.
Maybe, Chris,
you can answer this.
One of you are gonna have to.
You put your money
in a valuation
of around $50,000
for the business.
Rebecca invested in the company
when it was an idea.
We launched the product.
We had sales.
It's proving that people like
this product.
Rebecca, here's where
I was wrong about citikitty.
It fixed a problem.
Yes.
People didn't have to clean
Kitty litter.
(Rebecca) Of course.
The reason I like that
is it solves a problem.
Yes.
I don't want to talk
to the person next to me
on the airplane.
Tell us--Tell us about
this one.
Okay, so there are
1.5 billion people
that fly on airlines
every single year.
Rebecca, you obviously have
a number in mind.
Why are we skating around it?
What's your number?
20% for $90,000.
Okay. So we've heard
from both of you. I'm out.
Why are you out?
Because they don't want
to meet us halfway.
You won't accept the 40%.
You won't accept 35%.
(Robert) Rebecca, let me make it
very simple.
I'll give you the $90,000
for 20%.
I missed out on you once.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not gonna do it again.
I think you're gonna
make it happen.
Wow.
That's a full-price offer.
Why would you even hesitate?
I'm looking at
the majority shareholder.
I have--He has to make
that decision.
Robert, you have a deal.
Very good.
Damn.
(Robert) Excellent.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks. Nice to be
in business with you this time.
Thank you. Thanks, you guys.
Whoo! Thanks!
Very Good. Thank you.
Good luck to you.
(Robert) Well...
you sneaky guy, you.
(laughs)
I'll tell you something.
That lady--She's gonna
make it happen.
I don't like her.
I don't care if you like her.
You like her when
she's on your side.
I feel so excited to come back
in "Shark tank" Again
