So I'm gonna give you
ten seconds, Chris.
Before you do that--
I am not gonna let
this price go up.
Oh, he's pulling
an old Mark Cuban.
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
I absolutely hate
to see young entrepreneurs
Getting completely screwed.
It's sink...
What is it
we don't know yet?
Or swim.
You just got on board
as an opportunist.
She's not stupid.
I think they call me
a mini shark.
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran
went from working
as a waitress in Manhattan
to building the city's
preeminent real estate empire.
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert
who grew his homemade
clothing line
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his first
internet companies
for over $350 million.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.
In season 2,
Rebecca Rescate pitched
her cat toilet training system
citikitty...
you take the citikitty training
seat that you see there,
you put it on your toilet,
and you fill it with
a small amount of kitty litter.
And sealed a deal
with Kevin Harrington...
20%, $100,000?
Yes.
Okay.
Which catapulted her business
to huge success.
Before "Shark tank,"
citikitty had only $100,000
in sales a year,
and now citikitty is breaking
$1 million this year alone.
Now she's back to the tank
to try her luck again
with a partner
and a brand-new product.
She's so familiar.
Oh, yeah.
Hello, sharks. I'm Chris.
And I'm Rebecca.
Our product is Hoodie Pillow.
We're seeking $90,000
for 15% of our company.
Sharks, you may remember me
and my product from season 2,
the citikitty
cat toilet training kit.
Not only did I walk away
from "Shark Tank" with a deal,
but my experience helped me see
the huge potential
in my newest venture,
Hoodie Pillow.
Citikitty revolutionized
owning a cat.
Get ready for Hoodie Pillow
to revolutionize relaxation.
Americans love hoodies Because
they provide casual comfort
wherever you go.
You put your hood on,
you zip it up,
and you're in your own
cozy environment.
We love our hoodies so much,
we would wear them
every chance we could.
But at times,
they become impractical.
When lying down,
they pull at your neck,
and when sleeping,
the sweatshirt gets too hot.
And really, the best part
about them is just the hood.
Problem solved
with Hoodie Pillow.
Hoodie Pillow combines
the comfort of your pillow
with America's favorite
piece of clothing...
Oh, you're kidding me.
(Kevin laughs)
the hoodie.
(Robert laughs)
The hood is completely attached
to the pillowcase.
There's no pulling.
There's no discomfort.
It allows you
to turn your head
and sink into your comfy spot
with ease.
Our design has
adjustable drawstrings
that block out light
and dampen sound,
a convenient pocket
for your phone and tv remote,
or a porthole that keeps
your headphones tangle-free.
Daymond, why don't you come on
down and give it a try?
I'll give a shot. You know,
I made some money off of hoods.
I'm gonna lay down...
you're gonna lay down
and put the hood on.
(Kevin)
Stick your head in it.
(all laughing)
(Robert) Ohh.
I-I don't think he can look
more ridiculous.
(all laugh)
Or more relaxed.
Right now for Hoodie Pillow,
we've already sold
over 3,000 units.
We launched eight weeks ago.
All right.
(Mark) That's your market.
(laughter continues)
(nasal voice)
Can I get into the club?
(laughter continues)
All right.
(Kevin) Hey, Rebecca,
you had...
(Rebecca) You know what?
Let--Let's call it
like it is.
You had a Winner in
the cat, uh, poo-poo dome thing.
There was no question
about it.
Citikitty is doing fantastic.
We're gonna reach
about $5 million in sales
this coming year.
$5 million?!
Good for you.
Did you invent this?
Chris is the inventor
of this product.
And as soon as I saw it,
I knew the huge market potential
for it.
There was a reason that
the snuggie sold $500 million
in product.
(Kevin) So you just got on board
as an opportunist?
I think they call me
a mini shark.
(chuckles) A mini shark.
I own 30% of the company.
How much did you put up?
$15,000.
Chris--Christopher, how did you
come up with it?
I invented Hoodie Pillow
After bringing my triplet girls
home from the hospital.
Our lives were turned
upside down,
our sleep schedules were
completely taken away from us,
and I needed a way to shut
the world off just a little bit
and regroup.
I've known Rebecca
for a few years,
and she was one of the first
people that it brought it to.
And you should've seen
the look on her face.
So, Rebecca, you have a knack
for crazy-looking stuff.
Yes.
But you were right last time.
I gotta tell you,
when you came out here,
I thought it was the most
ridiculous thing I'd ever seen,
and your proved us all wrong.
I have the same reaction here.
Yeah.
Well, you have
to keep in mind,
we launched Hoodie Pillow
eight weeks ago--
A soft launch with one Link
on facebook--
And we did $60,000
in 8 weeks.
I invested in, uh, Chris
and in this product
'cause I believe in it.
Chris and I--on our, uh--
but you already have a shark,
one of our beloved sharks,
who helped you with this
progress--Kevin Harrington--
Yep.
Of your citikitty.
You have money.
You have distribution.
I came here thinking that
your experience in textiles...
Yeah.
And then the experience that
Barbara has with consumer--
(Robert) I know why she's here.
(Rebecca) It's different.
Because "Shark tank" made
citikitty a $5 million product.
She's not stupid.
Maybe, Chris,
you can answer this.
One of you are gonna have to.
You put your money
in a valuation
of around $50,000
for the business.
Then you walk in here
and tell me it's worth $600,000.
Rebecca invested in the company
when it was an idea.
We launched the product.
We had sales.
It's proving that people like
this product.
They see it and they buy it.
We posted one link on facebook.
The product went viral.
Within three weeks, we were
on "Good Morning America,"
"today" Show, aol, msn,
yahoo's main pages,
nasdaq "Businessweek."
People see it and they buy it.
Rebecca, here's where
I was wrong about citikitty.
It fixed a problem.
Yes.
People didn't have to clean
Kitty litter.
(Rebecca) Of course.
The reason I like that
is it solves a problem.
Yes.
I don't want to talk
to the person next to me
on the airplane.
Tell us--Tell us about
this one.
Okay, so there are
1.5 billion people
that fly on airlines
every single year.
And most of us are sitting
in a commercial aircraft.
We don't have
our own 757s or g5s.
We're flying, sitting within
1, 2 feet of somebody else.
Hoodie Pillow provides you
comfort by holding up your neck
when you're trying to relax,
and then also provides you
privacy.
The travel Pillow retails
for $15
and, uh, the cost is
less than $3 to make it.
You have pretty good credibility
in this space.
Even though the stuff may
be crap, you sell a lot of it.
So I'm gonna give you
ten seconds, Chris and Rebecca,
to please accept my offer,
'cause I'm excited, and I do not
want this price to go up.
Oh, he's pulling
the ol' Mark Cuban.
I think the--one of
the amazing things is
actually hearing what
all of the sharks have to say,
and we haven't even gotten
that opportunity yet.
We haven't heard anything
from Mr. Cuban or...
okay, the ten seconds is up.
I'm rescinding my offer.
I'm out.
Okay.
You have an offer
on the table.
So far, I have not heard
any others.
The only other was retracted
'cause Daymond's
in a nasty mood today.
I'm gonna make an offer.
Let's hear it.
I trust you, but I don't trust
the product enough.
Okay.
So I'll give you half
for 40% of your business.
But Daymond has got to come
back in with me,
putting up half of the $90,000
and I the other half.
He's a great partner for you.
And I want 10 cents
for every Pillow you sell.
Ooh!
Royalty.
Even worse.
Call it what you want.
Let's call it a royalty.
(laughs)
But you have to admit,
it's a very high-Risk business.
I don't agree with that.
We've launched this company
with $10,000
and were profitable
within the first few weeks.
And I've done this before--
If Barbara wants that deal,
I'm willing to entertain
that deal.
I already have a luggage line
with travelpro.
I could put this right into
that system and obv--
So, Daymond, you're willing
to partner with me?
I'm willing to partner with you,
but we need that answer now
before this drags out
and the prices go up.
W-We came in here
and wanting to do a deal.
I--And, Daymond, of course
we were thinking about you
'cause of your experience
in the textile industry.
But for giving up 40%
of the company
and then you have
two partners here...
let me make it
more interesting.
I am willing to put Daymond
in on my deal
and throw Barbara
under the bus.
I don't want this
to get too crazy.
I'm still
with Barbara on it,
because there wouldn't be
enough meat for Barbara and I
or Kevin and I to work
at a lower percentage.
Are you declining the offer
for $90,000?
Both Barbara and I will
be in for 40%.
I think that's too high
of a share of the company.
We've done $60,000 in goods.
I would do the same deal
if it's--if it's...
don't do it.
30%.
(Kevin)
my deal's very simple.
It's $90,000 for 33 1/3%.
We're 3-Way partners.
And we all get paid
at the same time,
which is very reasonable.
Daymond's and my deal
is $90,000 cash for 40%,
and we get 10 cents
on every Pillow that you sell.
Barbara and Daymond, can you do
that same deal at 30%?
Don't do it. You guys are crazy
if you do that deal.
If we went halfway and met you
right in the middle--35%--
Would you come the other half?
Rebecca, you obviously have
a number in mind.
Why are we skating around it?
What's your number?
20% for $90,000.
Okay. So we've heard
from both of you. I'm out.
Why are you out?
Because they don't want
to meet us halfway.
You won't accept the 40%.
You won't accept 35%.
(Robert) Rebecca, let me make it
very simple.
I'll give you the $90,000
for 20%.
I missed out on you once.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not gonna do it again.
I think you're gonna
make it happen.
Wow.
That's a full-price offer.
Why would you even hesitate?
I'm looking at
the majority shareholder.
I have--He has to make
that decision.
Robert, you have a deal.
Very good.
Damn.
(Robert) Excellent.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks. Nice to be
in business with you this time.
Thank you. Thanks, you guys.
Whoo! Thanks!
Very Good. Thank you.
Good luck to you.
(Robert) Well...
you sneaky guy, you.
(laughs)
I'll tell you something.
That lady--She's gonna
make it happen.
I don't like her.
I don't care if you like her.
You like her when
she's on your side.
I feel so excited to come back
in "Shark tank" Again
and walk away
with another deal.
And Robert is gonna be
a great partner for us.
