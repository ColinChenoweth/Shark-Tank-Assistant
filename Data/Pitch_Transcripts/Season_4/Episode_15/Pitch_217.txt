before Pat and I
knock it out of the park.
If the sharks hear
a great idea,
they're ready to invest
using their own money...
I want to be involved
with this.
I think you're gonna hit
a home run with this.
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.
We also have the patent
on these bags.
We have 18 claims
in a utility patent.
I love a clear bag.
Mm-hmm.
I could look in my closet
and see exactly
what I'm pulling out...
Right.
Without opening a bag
to see what's inside--One.
And secondly, I covet
these little plastic bags
and save them
for when I travel because...
seriously?
I find if I group--
Because the clothing wrinkles
without the use of the bag.
So if you were to put
a man's suit, a woman's dress...
Right.
And a pair of trousers in there
without the plastic
on each one,
they will wrinkle.
It's true. Men's suits, if you
put the plastic between them,
don't wrinkle.
I never knew that.
(Kevin) Yeah, it's true.
Our bags are breathable.
Would you rather
search through that
or would you rather have
your stuff neatly hanging?
I'm Pat Pezet...
and I'm Matt Canepa.
And we live
in San Francisco, California.
And we are the owner
of grinds.
We met in college and played
baseball together there.
I was a second baseman,
and Matt was a catcher.
(laughs)
Get out!
(Matt) After my junior year,
I got drafted by a pro team
and played three years
of baseball
before heading back
to San Francisco.
Great job, guys.
Having played baseball
for a number of years,
you begin to realize
how prevalent
chewing tobacco is
and how unhealthy
and really disgusting it is.
So Matt and I got together
and decided
to do something about that.
We created this product
that helps people
stop using tobacco.
It's a product
baseball players love.
We know that it's got
huge potential
outside
and in much broader markets.
We need an investment
from the sharks
to take our great product
and put it on retail shelves
across the U.S.
The sharks will take
one look at our business
and see the two guys
behind it,
and realize they've got
a home run.
Hi. I'm Pat.
And I'm Matt.
And our company is Grinds.
And we're here today seeking
a $75,000 investment
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Our product,
grinds coffee pouches,
are filled
with freshly ground coffee
that's been flavored
and supplemented
with B vitamins
and other important nutrients
to keep you bright
and alert
while providing a healthy
alternative to chewing tobacco.
Our product has
a unique opportunity
to capitalize
and gain market share
in three of the most lucrative
markets in the world--
Tobacco, coffee, and energy.
And as former players
ourselves,
we spent the past two years
building our brand
through our contacts in both
major and minor league baseball
with over 20 major league teams
currently using the product,
including the Chicago Cubs
and Boston Red Sox.
In the U.S. alone,
chewing tobacco is
a $4.5 billion-a-year industry.
It is estimated that over
half of all users
make at least one attempt
to quit their habit.
With your help and experience,
we can take our product
into every gas station
and convenience store,
not only in the U.S.,
but in the world.
So, sharks, we urge you
to catch this golden opportunity
before Pat and I...
knock it out of the park.
(bat cracks ball)
(Barbara chuckles)
So before hand out some samples,
we'll give you a quick demo
in case you're not familiar
with how to use the product.
Open it up,
take out a pouch or two,
place it in your mouth.
Let it sit for 20 minutes,
half-hour, 45 minutes--
Whatever you need
to get your energy kick.
When you're done,
take it out, throw it away.
And that's it.
So now Matt's gonna pass out
our best seller--
The mint chocolate flavor
that you guys can all try.
And then we've got
the cinnamon roll and mocha
that you can open up and try
or check out the aroma.
(sniffs) whoa.
So you can put it kinda
right in your cheek.
You don't actually
Chew on it.
Okay, so this is starting
to work now.
I can taste the chocolaty...
(both) Yeah.
(Kevin) Coffee thing going here.
That's the idea.
How--How long
will the pouch last?
It can go up to 45 minutes
or so as well. I mean, it's--
How much coffee equivalent
in one pouch?
So one pouch is about
a quarter cup of coffee.
But one can has got
about 20 pouches,
which is four or five
cups of coffee.
One is just a quarter cup?
'cause I gotta tell you, it--
it feels a lot stronger.
It's strong. Yeah, Yeah.
Yeah, right.
So wait. How'd you guys
get into this?
So Matt and I met
at Cal Poly.
We were both
business finance students
playing baseball together.
Matt was a catcher.
He was actually drafted
by the Chicago Cubs.
We were working
on this econ project,
and we were procrastinating,
as most college students do.
We, uh, ended up not having
much in our pantries late night,
and we needed some sort
of energy kick.
So what did we do?
We actually took
coffee grounds--
Regular just coffee grounds--
And put it in our mouth.
Ew!
So after ten minutes or so,
we look at each other.
We kind of smile and we say,
"Yeah, we kind of feel
an energy kick,"
but we got all these coffee
grounds all over our teeth--
And we just started
brainstorming right away.
And we said, "why don't we
come up with a prototype?"
Next thing we knew, there was
a flyer on our campus...
Yeah.
That said, "Have a cool idea?
Free pizza."
So being starving
college students...
(Robert laughs)
Yeah, we went down,
filled out a questionnaire.
Next thing you knew,
we were pitching
at a business plan
competition,
had some seed money,
And, uh, and launched
our product at spring training.
So do you have sales today?
So in 2010 we did $3,500.
Matt and I were thinking at
the end of the baseball season,
it's time to get
a 9-to-5 job.
Two days after
the San Francisco Giants
won the world Series,
we got a call from
their manager Bruce Bochy.
He said, "guys, I've been
using your product.
It might be saving my life.
I wish you guys the best."
(singsongy) Bingo!
We took that as the kick
in the pants to say,
"All right, we gotta make
this product meet the idea."
And we proceeded to find
new manufacturing,
raised a little bit
of financing.
So basically last year in 2011,
we did $135,000.
And this year we are on track to
do $300,000 by--By year's end.
Wow.
So tell us about
the cost issues.
For retail,
direct to consumer,
we--We like to offer the cans
at about $3.99.
Is that equivalent to what
tobaccy would cost?
Tobacco can range from,
on the low side, $3.50,
to up to $7 with taxes.
What are you gonna sell it
to distribution for?
$2.69 per can.
And what do you make it for?
Last year the cost per can
was $1.30.
This year, it's been around
$1.24, $1.25.
And we're hoping to drop it
at least below $1.10
by the end of the year.
(Barbara) Hey, Matt and Pat,
I love your energy.
I think you have great energy.
I can't imagine you not selling
this product, frankly.
I get it.
But it's just not a product
that I can relate to--
Chewing something in my mouth
like this--So I'm out.
Hey, guys, you're--You're
creating a new category, okay?
And this is wonderful,
and you got a lot of energy,
and it's smart.
But one of the problems is,
coffee companies
have a lot of coffee.
If you prove out this category,
why wouldn't they crush you
like the cockroaches
you are right now?
What you need is capital.
You need money to fire it up,
and you gotta get
into retail faster.
You don't want to wait until
the coffee guys figure it out
and come after you.
You want to get the brand out
in every store you possibly can.
You need money.
Why don't I provide you
with $100,000?
And the way
you pay me back is,
every time you sell a tin,
you give me a quarter.
I'm gonna make it easy.
I'm not gonna ask
for any equity at all.
Maybe I'm your guy.
I'm your bank.
Perhaps, yeah.
(Daymond) Are you looking for
solely capital?
Or are you looking for
the strategic relationship?
Strategic relationship.
The strategic relationship
is of course valuable to us.
We know baseball, we know our
product, we know the numbers.
Distribution
is that missing link.
And we're doing our homework,
But someone who can
expedite that process--
Pat, honestly, I know
nothing about chewing tobacco.
But I want to be involved
with this.
I think you're gonna hit
a home run with this.
I'll give you the $75,000
for... 15%,
but I really would like Daymond
in on the deal with me.
Not because I need the money,
but I think he can do
the distribution.
I mean, that's his specialty.
I'm okay with Robert on that
because this is
such a good deal,
and you guys--
You guys know your stuff.
So what exactly
are you offering here?
So $75,000,
37.5 from each of us,
for 15%.
Why give up so much now
when in a year, after I help
you get distribution,
it'll be worth ten times more?
And I won't take any equity.
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.
I know what you need
and when you need it.
Yeah, you're definitely
correct in that sense.
I-I don't think we're--
Of course I'm correct.
Why give up any equity?
Mark, do you--
Mark, mark,
do you have anything
you'd like to add
to the conversation?
(laughs)
Look, guys,
in any sport, you can
play small or you can go big.
I see
tobacco replacement products
as a medium-Sized industry.
I see you guys carving out
a nice niche.
But like I always say,
you know,
the most valuable asset I need
to get a return on is my time.
And the return on time
just isn't there.
So for that reason, I'll make it
easier for these guys,
and I'll go out.
Okay.
Daymond and Robert,
would you guys be willing to
up the cash to $100,000
for 15% equity
and go in on the deal 50-50?
Would you be willing
to up the equity?
'cause that's all I was
gonna say as well.
It'd be--It'd be hard
to do that without more cash.
Guys, I'm not gonna do it.
And I'll tell you why
I'm not gonna do it.
With what I'm bringing
to the table,
the $25,000 is neither
here nor there.
Over the long run,
the $25,000 is not gonna
make the difference.
Yeah, you're step--
You're stepping over dollars
to save pennies right now.
I absolutely hate to see
young entrepreneurs
Getting completely screwed.
Why give up any equity?
I'm staying at the $75,000--
$37,500 from the 2 of us--
For 15%.
I'm gonna stay with that.
It's equity versus a royalty.
What are you going to do?
(speaks inaudibly)
yes.
And we would own 100%
of the patent or property.
Mm-hmm.
And we would pay you
a 12% royalty.
Correct.
So you basically want us to
work for you.
(laughs)
Well...
well, if you take 100%
of the company,
you will be doing that part.
Now because the important part
has been done--
The important part
Would've been
that you have
a large amount of sales.
A quarter of a million.
Is that done?
A quarter of a million
have been sold.
How did you sell them?
In the promotional products
industry.
And, uh, they g--They paid us
a licensing fee at that time,
and it was 10%.
(Robert)
so you've already got sales.
Is that deal over?
Yes, it is. It's over.
That deal is over.
What happened to that deal?
Well, we struck
that deal with
the largest promotional company
in the United States.
Unfortunately,
unbeknownst to us,
that company was going
under bankruptcy.
So they really actually
mismanaged the product.
There's inventory sitting
in Houston, waiting to be sold.
How much inventory?
We have 20,000 units
of inventory.
20,000 units of inventory.
Mm-hmm.
How much does each unit cost?
Uh, they cost a little bit
over a dollar to make.
Can we see a couple of units,
please?
Yeah, absolutely.
We did tooling,
uh, worked on the patent.
You didn't spend the money well.
We had attorneys for the --
We didn't
spend the money well.
We spent it in a--
We spent it very poorly.
And how much revenue
have you gotten back
through your licensing
and any other efforts?
We got 10 cents, uh,
10 cents per Unit.
(Robert) What was
the total dollar you got?
What was--
We got $25,000 from that time.
That's all you've made?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, during that--
Yeah, from promotional Products,
that's all we made.
That's correct.
How long ago did
the other company go bankrupt?
This was in 2000...
2004.
What problem is this solving?
It doesn't matter.
There are 30 million students
in colleges
that are sitting in dorm rooms
right now
that are laying within 4 feet
of somebody else
that love the hoodie Pillow.
And all looking to buy--Spend
their money on something stupid.
Right?
Yeah. It's only 20 bucks.
And what does it cost
to make it?
It costs us $5 to make one.
Is there a patent on this?
We have utility
and a design patent on this.
Nobody can put a Hood
on a pillowcase or a Pillow.
(laughs) That just sounds
so ridiculous.
(laughs) Yeah.
But you know what?
I knew, like, with citikitty,
that I could sell
maybe $10 million,
$15 million worth of goods.
But this product?
This is totally different.
We're talking
tens of millions of dollars.
Tens of millions?
Absolutely.
There are 300 million americans,
like, that this product
is applicable to.
It's anybody
with a head that sleeps,
and I'm pretty sure
that's every one of you.
(laughter)
And what are you gonna do
with the $90,000?
First, we're gonna start
investing in, um,
low-cost high-yield marketing.
What low-cost high-yield
marketing?
Uh, well,
a lot of social marketing
and stuff like that online,
facebook.
We posted a video, like,
two or three weeks ago
that have already had, like,
10,000 views
and have driven a ton of traffic
to our web site.
After that, we're gonna start
running a commercial
that we've already produced
and tested.
So you're not using any of this
for production
or anything of that nature?
(mouths word)
You have production
already locked up?
Yes.
We do have a new product.
Hoodie Pillow has
a huge market for it,
but the more exciting thing is,
there are 1.5 billion people
that fly on airlines
every year.
(laughs) Oh, god!
(Robert laughs)
(Mark) Actually,
that's not bad.
You know what? That's not bad.
Could you bundle that together
and sell 'em together?
That's what matters.
(chuckles) Well, thank you.
So here's an offer for you.
I'll make it very simple.
Um, I'll give you the 90k,
but I'm gonna be
a 1/3, third partner.
But the only way
I would do this deal
is that you don't take
any draw from the business,
and when you make the draw
you'll decide.
But each of us pay ourselves
the same amount
when the draw occurs.
Look at her.
She's already laughing at him.
Well, maybe she is,
maybe she isn't.
But right now
you haven't made any offers.
So when it comes time to
cash out, I wanna wet my beak
at the same pace you are.
I'm hearing "Cash out."
That's all I'm hearing.
I'm not hearing something
that's gonna help us grow this
business is what we're...
I don't want to help you grow
the business.
I don't want
to help finance it.
I just know that you're
very successful at what you do.
I don't know.
At least be respectful.
You may not get another offer,
so you should be careful.
Yeah.
Yes, you're right. Um...
(laughs)
(Kevin) Yes, I am.
I'm always right.
Oh, wow.
Um... we'll consider it.
You decide when
the capital comes out.
But when it comes out,
each of us get a third,
a third, a third.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Kevin, I would be interested
in working with you.
I like you a lot.
You're my favorite shark.
I would be willing to do...
25% for $100,000.
I wanna be a third,
a third, a third,
and I'm happy giving you 90k.
I like my offer.
I'd to hear if there are
other offers.
I mean, I think we're bringing
a lot to the table here.
We have a product that has
a huge market.
I'm--I'm just like Kevin.
I want--I want a third
of the company.
I don't care about
pulling the money out like that
necessarily.
If you guys are working
every day, I'm fine with that.
And I wanna take this to my guys
at travelpro,
and I wanna take that
to hsn
and--And help with
the manufacturing.
Can you make the decision
and give me in ten seconds?
Or I'm gonna be out.
