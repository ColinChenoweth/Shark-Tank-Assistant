First up is Jenny Nigrosh,
who believes she can make
the sharks a lot of green with
her environmentally friendly
business.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jennie Nigrosh.
I'm president
of the green garmento,
and I'm here
seeking $300,000
for 20% equity
in my growing business.
How many of you have ever had to
struggle with a twist tie
or search for clothing that was
suffocating inside plastic?
You're not alone.
Every year, U.S. dry cleaners
process 1.4 billion
items of clothing,
creating an estimated
300 million pounds
of single-use plastic
that invade our landfills
and waterways,
threatening our marine life,
including sharks...
(laughs)
And wildlife,
including Mr. Wonderful.
(laughter)
The green garmento has
multi functions
to help you create a cleaner
closet and a cleaner planet.
When you get the bag home,
simply turn it upside-Down.
It'll hang from
any hook in your house.
And it's
a space-Saving hamper,
or it'll fit
into a hamper frame.
Throw your dry cleaning in.
When you're ready
to go to the cleaner,
simply cinch the bag,
well, here's the other
problem, Jennie--
Charging you double
is what he should be doing.
But are--Robert, are you
saying this actually
had happened to you?
Yeah.
It's ridiculous.
Yep.
Here's the problem
when I looked into it--
Most dry cleaners
are relatively small.
Mm-hmm.
So they don't actually do
the dry cleaning at the shop.
Mm-hmm.
The problem was, they said,
actually sorting.
The idea of you bringing
your own bag
and them having to put
your stuff
in your bag
was too much time for them.
These plastic bags,
however,
are costing them
5 to 15 cents each.
So the sale
is to the dry cleaner,
and your pitch to them is,
"you're actually
gonna save money"?
if one person rotates
their two bags per year,
that is a $35- to $45-Saving
on just the one--
And they pocket that margin?
They keep that money?
Absolutely.
Yes.
And then they resale these.
These bags retail
on our web site for $9.99.
But currently now
how many competitors
do you have
and how big are they
in relevance to you?
One, really.
It's a totally different bag.
They aren't at all
consumer-driven.
Jennie, can we focus
on the numbers for a second?
Sure.
You say you're gonna make
$400,000 this year.
After you pay yourself
a normalized salary,
how much money will be
at the bottom line?
We are not in profit yet.
Who is "We"?
Oh, my husband and I. We run
the business together. Um--
So on $400,000 in sales,
you're not making any money?
Correct.
(Daymond) Ooh.
We are not--
Why?
It's a brand-New category.
Why?
Uh, it is a new business.
You know, we're just
four years in,
and to have--
four years?
You haven't made any money
in four years?
Um...
Well, we've made sales.
But you haven't made
any money.
How much did you lose
this year?
How much will you lose
on $400,000?
We probably l-Lose
about $10,000 a month or so.
A month? A month?
(Daymond) Whoa.
How much did you lose
last year?
to be honest, I don't know
the answer to that.
You're supposed to know how much
you're making or losing.
I know I'm supposed to now
my numbers cold.
I read your article. Um...
(laughs)
I did, because--
You didn't--You didn't take it
to heart. Yeah.
Because I didn't know you
were gonna ask me that.
(Kevin) Really, I have--
I have a--
I honestly--
How much money have you
put in over four years?
'cause we're about to ask
how much debt is on it.
We--We put in about
$380,000 of our own money.
Your money?
Actually, we have
non-Equity investors.
Non-Equity investors?
What do they get?
What are they doing,
lending you money?
They are getting, um...
debt?
A 9% revenue
until they're paid back.
That's brutal.
So you're paying 9% of
your revenue off the top?
Correct.
Okay, and how much did they
give you to get that 9%?
We raised, um,
about $900,000.
Ohh!
$900,000?
(Robert) wow.
You're in for $1.26 million.
Aha.
(Barbara) It gets worse.
Why do we have to pull
that out of you?!
(Robert) Sure, it is.
Jennie, let me ask you this,
how much gross sales
do you have to generate
to pay those people back?
Um... (exhales)
I...
these people trusted in you
and gave you $900,000.
It is a risk,
and we are paying 9% on--
Jennie, it's--
It's a great product,
and you're growing the business,
which I love.
But there was an elephant
in the room,
and we had to find it.
Okay.
I'm out.
(Barbara)
May I say something?
Sure.
I think the product's
very well-designed, very clever.
Thank you.
But it would just be like buying
into a problem, honestly.
So I'm out.
Okay.
(Kevin) You know,
the trouble with green,
it doesn't work unless there's
an economic reason.
People fundamentally
want to save the planet,
unless it costs them
something.
That's the cold, hard truth.
Mm-hmm.
That's why solar doesn't work
and that's why wind
doesn't work,
and this is why
this isn't working.
I'm out.
You learned
an expensive lesson, Jennie.
You know, one of the things
that entrepreneurs
always talk about is,
"if I only had the money,"
but debt is not your friend.
I-it's just a trap a lot
of entrepreneurs fall into.
Right.
And I'm out.
Okay.
It's a very intimidating room,
and...
I don't want to beat you up
for what you did
to start your business because
you didn't know any better.
You may have
just had a-a passion,
you wanted to get it started.
But your business turned,
unfortunately,
instead of cleaning bags,
into a body bag.
(chuckles)
I'm out.
Okay. All right.
Good luck, Jennie.
(Barbara) Thank you.
(Daymond) Thank you.
Good luck.
All right. Thank you.
It is definitely overwhelming,
and I did literally feel like
I was being circled
by the sharks.
If there's one thing I can tell
future entrepreneurs,
know... thy... numbers.
In season 1, Tiffany Krumins
made a deal
with Barbara Corcoran
for her children's
medicine dispenser
Ava the elephant.
You know what? I'd love
to take your offer.
I'm so happy. We're gonna make
money on this together.
Let's see
what she's up to now.
