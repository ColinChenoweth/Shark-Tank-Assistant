First up is Jenny Nigrosh,
who believes she can make
the sharks a lot of green with
her environmentally friendly
business.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jennie Nigrosh.
I'm president
of the green garmento,
well, here's the other
problem, Jennie--
Charging you double
is what he should be doing.
But are--Robert, are you
saying this actually
had happened to you?
Yeah.
It's ridiculous.
Yep.
Here's the problem
when I looked into it--
Most dry cleaners
are relatively small.
Mm-hmm.
So they don't actually do
the dry cleaning at the shop.
Mm-hmm.
The problem was, they said,
actually sorting.
The idea of you bringing
your own bag
Jennie, can we focus
on the numbers for a second?
Sure.
You say you're gonna make
$400,000 this year.
After you pay yourself
a normalized salary,
how much money will be
at the bottom line?
We are not in profit yet.
Who is "We"?
(Robert) Sure, it is.
Jennie, let me ask you this,
how much gross sales
do you have to generate
to pay those people back?
Um... (exhales)
I...
these people trusted in you
Jennie, it's--
It's a great product,
You learned
an expensive lesson, Jennie.
You know, one of the things
that entrepreneurs
always talk about is,
"if I only had the money,"
but debt is not your friend.
I-it's just a trap a lot
of entrepreneurs fall into.
Good luck, Jennie.
(Barbara) Thank you.
(Daymond) Thank you.
Good luck.
All right. Thank you.
