carry it like a duffel
or a yoga bag,
bring it to
your dry cleaner
and ask for them
to save the bag,
keep it with your clothes.
And when you get
your clothes returned,
the bag has magically morphed
into this gorgeous
hanging garment bag,
and your clothes are hanging
gently inside,
and not a single-use
plastic bag in sight.
Sharks, sometimes the biggest
ideas truly are the simplest.
Please help the world
to be fantastic,
use less plastic,
and invest
in the green garmento.
Cool idea.
How do I make money?
Right now
dry cleaning packaging
is about a $200 million
a year business.
This month, we're gonna reach
our million-dollar mark
in sales.
Whoa.
What about
the last 12 months?
Just this year,
we're at about $260,000.
We have projected
just under $400,000.
Do I pay for the bag
as the consumer,
or does the dry cleaning shop
pay for it?
Depends where
you're buying it.
Most likely, you'd buy it
from your dry cleaner,
and they buy it from us.
Do you sell
to dry cleaners?
We sell to dry cleaners
all over the country.
What do you sell 'it for?
Um, they are in the $4 range,
and then we print
their logos on them.
So we also--We do mostly
customized bags.
What do they cost you
to make?
There's two things my mama
never told me to talk about,
and that's my age and how much
my bags cost. (chuckles)
No. Come on now.
How are we gonna know?
You can't hold that back.
But did mama tell you you ain't
gonna get an investment?
(laughs) And my mama's
from Boston,
so it's weird
that she'd talk like that.
Um...
(laughs)
They are under $2.
Do they charge me more...
no.
As opposed to plastic?
Which is exactly what
my dry cleaner did.
He came out with these bags,
and I keep losing them.
And every time I lose them,
they charge me money for it.
Okay.
Is--Is that one of the models
that people are using?
That's not normally what
we would like to have happen.
First of all, your dry cleaner
Should be giving you free bags
because you're Mr. Herjavec,
but...
that's True.
Um, the, uh...
(laughs) No, he should be...
Hi. I'm Carlos Ortiz.
And I'm Scott Duff.
Together, we're my cold snap,
and we're here seeking $50,000
for 100% stake in our company,
plus 12% royalty
on future sales.
Huh?
(Barbara) 100%?
There you go. It's like Kevin's
book of entrepreneurship.
We've got a--We've got
a great deal for you guys,
but more importantly,
we've got a great product
to share with you.
Scott, let's say that you find
yourself by a pool or on a boat
and you wanna
keep your drinks cold.
How would you keep
those cool?
I'd use an ice chest.
Okay.
Now you're ready to enjoy
one of those drinks.
You take it out
of your ice chest
into the hot summer sun.
How would you go about
trying to keeping those cool?
My cold snap--The only Ice chest
that fits in your hand.
Guys, my cold snap works
because it leverages
the simplest process.
It's just ice and water
in a cup.
He takes the drink out of
his ice chest in the sun,
he simply slides it
into his cold snap,
he Seals it all together
with Our Leak-Proof ring...
(clicking)
And now he has an ice chest
that fits in his hand.
His last sip will literally be
as cold as his first.
(can fizzes)
Right now, we're looking for
a fast-swimming shark
who can take my cold snap
to the next level.
Who's it gonna be?
So you wanna get $50,000
from us...
(Robert) So, Carlos,
my dad always told me,
if it's too good to be true,
it's too good to be true.
You've licensed it. You've
created it. You've got sales.
I mean, why aren't you doing
the heavy lifting?
(Daymond) You don't have
too many sales
'cause he still has inventory,
Robert.
Why are you telling us that
you can't sell your own product?
What is it we don't know yet
and we're gonna find out
in two seconds?
No, Kevin, we're not. Before
when it was launched prior,
we didn't not own the tooling.
In order to get it to
the promotional products
industry, we spent $200,000.
And it augmented us
pretty inefficiently.
What did you spend
the $200,000 on?
We--We went to mexico.
We--We did prototypes first.
So it's been sitting around
forever then.
(Scott speaks indistinctly)
It's been sitting around
for a little bit.
(Robert) Oh, I thought
this was, like, now.
So you haven't been able to sell
those units?
(Scott and Carlos
speak indistinctly)
No, no, no,
this is getting nasty, guys,
no, no, no, Daymond, Daymond,
maybe we're not doing
a good job communicating.
You're doing a horrible job,
don't worry about it, okay?
(mark laughs)
it--There was a period
of inactivity. We--We...
eight years. Eight years.
(Scott speaks indistinctly)
(Robert) What did you do
in the eight years, Scott?
Well...
well--
You put it on ice, right?
(mark, Barbara,
and Robert laugh)
We didn't put it on pause,
and I'll tell you why.
So we stopped for a little bit.
We had spent $200,000.
Now we're a little bit older,
a little bit Wiser,
and have a little bit more
powder in our--In our storage.
So we were relaunching,
and we recognized
the opportunity that
you guys could accomplish.
So this, for me, feels like
you took a cold body
out of the closet,
you're wheeling it back in,
you want us to buy in.
If you're not excited about
running your business...
(speaks indistinctly)
(chuckles) I can't get excited.
Barbara, Barbara,
I'm--I'm sorry that we gave--
I'm sorry that we gave
that--That--That--
I'm sorry. I'm out.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Barbara, it--
It's not a cold body.
It--Well...
Okay, so, you guys,
now--Now you've actually
created more confusion
because you just spent
$20,000 more
to get 20,000 units
of inventory.
Mm-hmm.
Why?
Because today, we have the time,
we have the resources.
And we are fully committed.
Believe me, there's nobody
that's more committed to this--
you can't--You are not
fully committed to a product
where you're saying,
"We're just gonna give you
the company for $50,000."
I don't have a problem
with the approach.
What I have a problem with
is this thing died years ago,
and now you're trying
to pawn it off on us.
It--It didn't die.
It was a dead business
years ago.
Our goal--Carlos and I's goal
is--is to move this thing
forward.
We think it has
tremendous potential.
Scott, never invest
in a business
that's rolling downhill,
'cause a boulder rolling
downhill cannot be stopped.
I'm out.
Okay. Let--Let--Let me say...
I'm just trying
to figure out,
can I make any money
off this thing?
I don't think so.
I think the problems
are really dramatic
in terms of how you get it
to the market.
I don't think the beer business
or the pop business
or any bottler's gonna
add to the cost
of distributing their product
when They've already got sales.
They're gonna have
no interest.
So I gotta sell it
one at a time.
I have no interest
in joining you in that hell.
I am out.
Okay.
(Daymond)
You're asking for 12% royalty.
So in this market,
a royalty at 12%--
I could probably go get
Mickey mouse as a license
and put it on anything
and sell a large amount of it.
So for something unknown,
you should be asking for 5%.
That's just the beginning
of the problems
of something you haven't proven
in the market. I'm out.
Before we continue
with any--
This--This boulder
that's rolling,
let's get off the royalties.
Really, what we want--
Well, that's not working so far,
is it?
Well... Well...
guys, I'd like to--
I'd like to stop it.
(mark and Daymond laugh)
Uh...
hard to stop a boulder.
I'm--I'm trying. I'm trying.
The problem is,
I don't like it,
I don't want it,
I don't need it,
and I definitely don't want
to help it.
So...
(tears paper)
I'm out.
(Mark) Thanks, guys.
Thanks for your time.
