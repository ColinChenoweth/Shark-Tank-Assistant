(T.J.) we created
the inventioneers
eight years ago
with the goal
of changing the world
through our inventions.
Come back here, you!
Come back!
When we're not inventing,
we're just regular kids.
We ride bikes, play soccer,
do homework together.
We're just best friends.
(grunts)
We've invented a solution
to one of the biggest problems
facing drivers today--
Distracted driving.
(all) Three, two, one.
(cheering)
(T.J.) right now our invention
is just a prototype.
But we want to get it
out there to the public
as soon as possible,
(all) one, two, three!
Go, inventioneers!
(cheering)
Hi. We're the inventioneers.
My name is Bryeton.
I'm here with T.J., Paige,
To get a deal,
the inventioneers need an offer
from Robert or Mark.
(Robert)
Here's where I'm at--
I love cars, I race cars,
I know
all the car company guys,
is the inventioneers.
The smartwheel is simply
a product that you've invented.
The thing to do
with a great invention
(inventioneers laugh)
(laughs) We did it.
(singsongy)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
We're investing
in these kids.
They're super smart.
I--they are. They are.
They're gonna do smart things.
They are gonna figure it out.
I agree with you.
They're fantastic.
But I have to also tell you,
I love the product.
Jaiden's crying.
(all laugh)
It's okay. It's okay.
(T.J.) Oh, wow.
(girl) Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe
that actually happened.
(Jaiden, voice breaking)
The sharks actually
(all) The inventioneers!
