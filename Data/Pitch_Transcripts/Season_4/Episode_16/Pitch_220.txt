and we're the inventioneers!
(T.J.) we created
the inventioneers
eight years ago
with the goal
of changing the world
through our inventions.
Come back here, you!
Come back!
When we're not inventing,
we're just regular kids.
We ride bikes, play soccer,
do homework together.
We're just best friends.
(grunts)
We've invented a solution
to one of the biggest problems
facing drivers today--
Distracted driving.
(all) Three, two, one.
(cheering)
(T.J.) right now our invention
is just a prototype.
But we want to get it
out there to the public
as soon as possible,
and that's why
we need the sharks.
(Bryeton) If we don't get
a deal with the sharks,
then the world will miss out on
one of the most amazing products
to ever hit the streets.
(all) one, two, three!
Go, inventioneers!
(cheering)
Hi. We're the inventioneers.
My name is Bryeton.
I'm here with T.J., Paige,
Jaiden, Emily, and Kate.
We're 6 inventors,
ages 12 to 18.
Today we're looking for $100,000
in exchange for 15%
of our company.
(Paige) Sharks, as parents,
you unfortunately know
that this
is a very common occurrence
among teen drivers.
Stop it.
(girls laugh)
Teens think
they can multitask
and drive safely.
But they're faced
with distractions
like cell phones, makeup,
eating, drinking,
and fooling around
with friends.
Oh, my gosh.
(girls laugh)
(laughs)
No way!
That is so cool.
Now, sharks,
please join our teen driver
and imagine you are driving
down the freeway.
Put your hands up
at 9 and 3.
Now close your eyes.
One, two, three, four.
(bang)
In those four seconds,
our teen driver traveled
the length of a football field.
Thankfully,
these kids are okay.
But 18 teenagers die
every day in the U.S.
From car crashes.
The number-one cause--
You guessed it--
Distracted driving.
We want to make
a difference in the world
by solving this problem.
So... ? tada ?
we created the smartwheel.
(Paige) We realized
that most distractions
require drivers to take one
or both hands off the wheel.
So we thought
why not create a product
that would alert drivers
when they make that mistake.
And that's what
the smartwheel does.
The smartwheel's
proprietary technology
tracks
a driver's hand position
and alerts the driver
through red lights and a tone
if it detects one of three
unsafe hand positions.
First is
no hands on the wheel.
(beeps)
That's obviously unsafe.
Second,
one hand off the wheel
is another
unsafe hand position...
(beeps)
because it's a good indication
that the driver is distracted.
And third
is two hands together...
(beeps)
Which is a common
texting position.
The smartwheel then
records the events
and can alert third parties,
such as parents.
Today we're looking for
your help
to get our business
off the ground...
(all) So that we can save lives,
and you can make money.
(laughs)
(Barbara) Nice job.
Thank you.
(Mark)
guys, to get it rolling,
is it a prototype or is it
a product right now?
It's a prototype
right now.
The first thing we're
gonna do
with the $100,000
is take approximately
$75,000 of it,
um, and complete what we call
the final industrial design
for manufacturing.
We'll then use the remainder to
start our first production run.
How are you gonna sell it?
We plan on selling it
on the internet.
Uh, we are open to going into
the big-Box stores eventually.
And for how much?
So we were planning on
retailing the smartwheel
for $200.
For cost to make it,
we have professional estimates
that say $50.
Let me ask you a question.
You showed us all the activities
that teens shouldn't be doing.
How does the device actually
stop them from doing it?
It doesn't.
It just records it.
You don't see a problem
with that?
And let me suggest
a modification.
Let's say
they're sitting there,
they take
a hand off the wheel.
They get a 120-volt shock.
(all laugh)
Maybe that's gonna work,
but I--
It's not stopping anybody from
doing all of these bad things.
It's just recording
the event.
Guys, have you
demonstrated anywhere
or put it in use for trials
or anything like that?
Actually, one of
the first things we did, too,
once we came up
with the idea,
was to do a pilot study.
You want to talk more
about that, Bryeton?
At that pilot study,
90% of the pa--
No, tell 'em where--
Where we did it at.
At M.I.T.
90% of the participants
said that
the smartwheel
would be effective
at changing
the driver's unsafe behavior.
We had an order
from a very high-ranking
government official.
Do you want me to tell you
who he is?
(Mark) Sure.
How about president obama?
We actually were invited
to the White house
to present to him,
and he loved the smartwheel
so much
that he wants one
for his daughters
when they're old enough
to drive.
Wow.
I would love to be part
of this.
But honestly, the challenge is
that I know absolutely nothing
about this space.
I know manufacturing,
but I don't know
electronic manufacturing.
I can't offer you any value.
I'm out.
(Barbara)
I'm picturing myself
introducing this
to my 17-year-old son.
One pitch is, "Hey, This is
gonna help you drive safe,
"and we're gonna get a report
if you take your hands
off the wheel."
That thing
ain't going on that car.
If it's going on,
it's gonna come off quickly.
I think you've gone
too far with the product.
I think you have to eliminate
the report back to the parent.
(Paige) But if we don't have
the reporting,
then there's no incentive
for the teen to actually...
Actually, yeah,
can I--can I--
work with the lights.
No, you know what?
I don't agree with you.
I think teenagers
do want to be safe,
But they don't want their ma
and their father looking over
their shoulder all the time.
Right. You're--You're mi--
They want to get away.
But then I do want to
bring up the numbers
from our surveys that,
you know,
85% of them said--
Teens agreed--
Teens should use
the smartwheel and--
I'm not convinced. I'm out.
(Kevin)
Here's my take on this--
You've achieved a whole lot,
putting this
whole thing together.
You've taken an idea and gone
all the way to the White House.
That's cool.
Now if you only had
a good idea,
just think
what you'd be doing.
You will one day come up
with a good product
that I can invest in,
and when that day comes,
you're invited
back through those doors,
and I will write you a check.
But today, no. I'm out.
To get a deal,
the inventioneers need an offer
from Robert or Mark.
(Robert)
Here's where I'm at--
I love cars, I race cars,
I know
all the car company guys,
and most importantly,
I have a 16-year-old daughter
who just started to drive.
I can't believe
this isn't an option
within an existing car.
Where I'm struggling
a little bit is,
I think you're missing
the business that you're in.
You think you're
in the smartwheel business,
But the name of your company
or of you guys
is the inventioneers.
The smartwheel is simply
a product that you've invented.
The thing to do
with a great invention
is now go and sell it
to somebody.
I think trying to manufacture it
and doing all this other stuff
is just crazy.
We did get, uh, another offer
to do a pilot study.
We were actually able to talk
with the U.S. Secretary
of Transportation Ray Lahood.
He not only endorsed
the smartwheel,
but he also offered
to set us up
for a pilot study
on Mass transit vehicles.
So what was the follow-up
to that?
The follow-up is,
we need more smartwheels
to test it with.
(Robert) Here's what
I'm willing to do.
I'll give you the $100,000
for 30%...
contingent on
taking it to a car company
and them being interested
in moving forward
with a licensing deal.
Was anyone willing
to go in on that deal?
What am I,
chopped liver to you?
No, you are awesome.
My offer's not good enough?
We are--we are on the edge
of our seats here.
Robert,
I'll go in with you 50/50
if you take out the contingency
on the car companies,
because I think once we go
visit the car companies,
and we've talked to them
not just about
driver training for kids
but also
the commercial applications,
we have the opportunity
to pivot.
My only issue is,
T.J.'s vision is to take...
I agree. I-I agree.
The entire $100,000
to manufacture.
I don't want to do that.
No, I--Okay, so, T.J.,
would you be open to,
once we discuss everything...
Mm-hmm.
If the best course of action
is not necessarily
to take that further along
But talk to the car companies,
let them help us design it
so we don't have to spend
all that money,
so we have
a little dry powder left
to--to evolve and pivot?
Yeah.
All right, Mark and I
will give you $100,000 for 30%.
What do you say?
No contingency?
No contingency.
That's a deal.
(laughs)
All right.
Thank you so much, guys.
Wow. Great job.
Congratulations, guys.
Thank you.
Thanks. Congratulations.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
(Robert) I love cars.
This is so cool.
Here.
(imitates engine revving)
(inventioneers laugh)
(laughs) We did it.
(singsongy)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
We're investing
in these kids.
They're super smart.
I--they are. They are.
They're gonna do smart things.
They are gonna figure it out.
I agree with you.
They're fantastic.
But I have to also tell you,
I love the product.
Jaiden's crying.
(all laugh)
It's okay. It's okay.
(T.J.) Oh, wow.
(girl) Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe
that actually happened.
(Jaiden, voice breaking)
The sharks actually
treated us like adults,
and they valued our ideas.
And it's great to see
someone else
appreciate the smartwheel
as much as we do.
(all) The inventioneers!
(cheering)
