Thank you.
You're welcome.
They sure look yummy, huh?
They are yummy.
Mmm.
So the middle one
is dark chocolate.
There's one that's chocolate
with caramel.
(Carmen) Milk chocolate.
Oh, that's a good one.
(Kevin) Carmen, it's gotta be
a million calories.
It's not

It's only 200 calories,
but I'm not trying
to market these as a fat-free.
saying, "Carmen,
I gotta have s'more."
(Robert chuckles)
Okay, Carmen, what--
what are your sales?
How do you sell them,
Carmen?
75% of my customers
come direct to me online
or they phone in.
That's been my primary focus
over the first two years.
Do any stores
carry them as well?
So there are a few stores
that carry 'em--
Local specialty bakeries,
wine stores.
(Mark)
How much do you sell it for
stop the madness, Carmen.
Let's walk through this.
You've got a dozen little
shmuffins or shmores in there.
They're used to paying
shipping...
(Robert) But why argue
with you, Carmen?
All right, Carmen. I'm not
gonna invest in your shmagels.
I'm out.
(laughs) Sorry, Carmen.
What's your background?
I was an advertising
sales executive.
I was laid off
during the recession.
I got a severance package.
Carmen, you're so in love
with your s'muffins,
you can't see the dollars
from the marshmallows.
I'm out.
(Robert) Carmen,

where you have to ask for
$75,000 from us
(Carmen) It was just weird
that they didn't
go bananas over them.
It's almost like I was
in the twilight zone... (laughs)
Because that was--That's not
the typical reaction.
How can there only be
a dozen of them in that box?
'cause it's full of ice.
You're shipping water
across the country.
(sharks laugh)
in season 3, Donny Mccall
failed to get a deal
with the sharks
for his folding cargo system,
invis-a-rack.
I'm committed to making
invis-a-rack
in the United States.
(Kevin) Donny.
Yes, sir.
You can't solve the problem
we're talking about here.
I believe I can make it.
I know I can.
Let's see
what he's up to now.
