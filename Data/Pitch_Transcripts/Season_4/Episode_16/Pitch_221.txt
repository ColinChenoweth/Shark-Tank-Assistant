I'm Yuen.
And I'm Peter.
We're brothers
from Austin, Texas.
And we started the sushi
revolution, how do you roll?
Great combination.
You got it.
Coming right up.
I'm the C.E.O.
Of the company.
I deal with
all the business stuff.
And I'm the C.O.O.
I'm on the creative side.
And I came up
with the menu.
Everything good? Yes?
Well, we both grew up
in the restaurant business.
Our parents had several
Chinese restaurants.
So at the tender age
of 8 and 9,
we both started working
in our parents' shop.
The restaurant business
is in our blood.
It's in our veins.
It's just what we know.
What can I get for you,
sir?
I'd love to have
that slammin' Salmon.
Slammin' Salmon?
You got it.
Together, we've created
a sushi experience
that's never
been done before.
Can you add cucumber
to that?
The artichoke.
Can I get that with crab?
We've allowed the customer
to become the chef.
So our customers
get to choose everything--
From the type of wrap
they want to use
to the rice
they want to use,
the veggies, the proteins,
the sauces, the toppings.
And nobody is doing
what we're doing today.
Getting an investment
from the sharks is critical
at this stage
of where we are as a company.
I believe our business model
is gonna be the next great thing
in ethnic food.
And with
the sharks' investments,
we're gonna be able
to explode this concept.
My name is Yuen Yung.
And I'm his younger brother
Peter Yung.
Our business is
how do you roll?
We are seeking $1 million
for 12% of our company.
How do you roll? Is
a fast-Casual restaurant
where you can get sushi rolls
made to order,
just the way you like it.
Before we
came onto the scene,
if you wanted sushi,
you really
only had two choices.
Option number one
was to go to
a fancy, sit-Down
sushi restaurant
where you had to dress right,
you had to smell right,
you gotta like techno music.
(laughing)
And, you know,
those can be fun occasionally,
if you want to spend more money
than you actually have
trying to impress people
you really don't like.
(chuckles)
So that leaves you
with your second option.
You go down to
the local grocery store,
you get a premade roll
made fresh "daily."
You just don't know which day of
the week it was actually made.
The quality is just subpar.
And because of
Yuen's horrible experience,
we started the sushi revolution
three years ago
with just one location
in Austin, Texas.
We've taken
the same food quality
you get
at a high-end restaurant
and paired it up
with the convenience
of the grocery store.
Unpretentious, good food
in a fast-casual environment.
(Yuen) So we want you to
experience this for yourself.
So, Barbara, we would like
to actually invite you up...
how nice is this?
So you can create
your own sushi roll.
All right, Barbara, whenever
you go to how do you roll?
Uh, the first thing
you want to do...
Mm-hmm.
Is pick out
what kind of wrap you'd like.
We have seaweed wrap,
and we have soy wrap.
I'll take the soy wrap.
Soy wrap. Good choice.
And what you get to do
is pick out your protein.
Mm-hmm.
We have crab stick,
chicken, salmon, tuna.
I'll take the tuna.
Okay, and we also have
proprietary sauces.
Wow.
Okay, do you like
spicy, sweet?
A little spicy.
A little spicy.
Our best seller
is the spicy mayo.
I'll take it.
And I'll go ahead
and put that on there.
(Peter) You can have a seat,
and I'll bring that
right out to you.
Sharks, do not fear,
we have food for you, too.
You're gonna get to sample
our other side of the menu,
which is our featured rolls.
He's making it right there.
He's making it
right now.
Thank you, Yuen.
You bet.
Daymond.
Thank you.
Enjoy.
Mmm.
Thank you, sir.
There you go.
Good sushi.
(mouth full) Fantastic.
(Yuen) Thank you.
Thank you.
Hurry. Hurry.
Barbara, this is
your custom roll.
There you go.
How nice is this?
Yeah.
Mmm.
(Daymond) Very good.
This is very good.
So here's our question--
Who wants to roll
with us?
Yuen, how did you
get started in this?
You know, it's funny.
We both grew up
in the restaurant business.
I actually said,
"I'm never gonna be in
the restaurant business again.
I'm never gonna work
with family,"
'cause I had to work with
my parents growing up. (laughs)
Uh, 14 years later,
uh, here I am, standing
next to my brother.
Tell us about the economics
of the business.
Absolutely.
Uh, so we started franchising
two and a half years ago.
We have sold 40 total.
We've gotten
15 of them opened,
two of them
are corporate stores.
So the first two stores
are our own.
We opened the first two.
Since then, we've been
focusing on franchising.
Got it.
And the franchisees--
How long has
the longest one been open?
Uh, one has been open
for right at about a year.
And how are they doing?
What are the economics
of their business?
So far, so good.
Knock on wood.
Are they profitable?
They are.
What's the average bill
in the sit-Down restaurant?
Roughly, it's around
$10 to $12.
Sushi's good.
Let's talk money.
Yeah.
You're offering me 12%
of the corporate entity...
correct.
That owns
all the franchise flows
for $1 million.
That is correct.
So what is this year's
cash flow gonna look like?
Just on royalties,
it's $250,000 a year.
Wow.
What are your sales
in the corporate stores?
Oh, uh, one is running
600-something-thousand,
and the other one
is running $400,000.
(Barbara)
I would like to ask,
I'm going to buy a franchise.
Tell me
what I have to pay you.
Okay. So the all-in cost
of the franchise,
including the $20,000
in franchise fee,
the building out of the store,
buying the equipment--
$270,000, $300,000 all in.
Mm-hmm.
(Daymond) So it looks like--
now they're in business.
Yes.
But what happens after that?
You get a percentage
of what they sell?
That is correct.
A royalty.
What's your royalty rate?
Our royalty rate is 7%.
What are the compliance systems
you have
to make sure
you're getting paid?
Uh, we suck it right out
of their checking account
every week.
(laughs)
So you mean, in other words,
they have to set up
a corporate account...
that is correct.
(Mark) Guys,
let me jump first.
I-I like the idea.
I like the concept.
But that's
a brutally competitive area.
I don't want to be
in the sushi business,
so I'm out.
(Kevin) I-I'm looking at it
from a different perspective.
I believe
it's very well managed.
I think
your presentation's excellent.
And you have
the right combination--
The chef guy
with the finance guy.
That's perfect.
The valuation is rich.
It--It is probably
a little bit high.
We--we have had a, uh,
letter of intent sent to us
to, uh, buy 75%
of the company.
And, uh, that valuation
came in at 6.6.
Ah.
Are you going
to do that deal?
Uh, I-I don't think so.
I don't think you should.
Yeah, the reason why is,
because number one,
I don't want to lose
that much of the company.
Uh, really, honestly,
with the opening
of, uh, four or five
more stores,
our royalties will--will--
Will get us to--
to profitability.
What's your geography right now?
Are they all in Texas?
No. They are in, uh,
California, Marina Del Rey,
uh, we have one
in Phoenix, Arizona,
Tucson, Arizona.
Yuen, I got--I gotta tell you,
man, you--You started a business
a few years ago,
and someone's offering you
$6.6 million in cash...
Mm-hmm.
You'd be
a multimillionaire overnight,
and you're just talking about
turning it down like that.
We are.
Power to you,
'cause I gotta tell you,
the first time somebody
offered me a million bucks...
Yeah.
I--it took me weeks
to say no.
I understand.
I wanted to grab that check...
right.
And run.
(Yuen and Barbara laugh)
(Daymond) So, guys, the profit
that you make in food
is in appetizers,
liquor and/or beverages,
and desserts.
There's no money in this,
and you're selling fish--
Fresh fish.
I think that the margins
are gonna be too low.
I'm out.
Okay.
Great presentation.
Uh, more importantly,
great food.
Um...
I can't help you
with the operation.
I don't understand
this particular food model.
You're running
a great, great business.
Thank you.
I'll bring all my buddies,
we'll spend a lot of money...
okay. Thank you.
But we're not gonna spend
$1 million to invest today.
I'm out.
You have 15 locations
in 2 1/2 years.
That is correct.
Amazing.
Thank you.
I have recently gotten involved
in two different
food franchises,
and I'm quickly learning
how complicated it is.
It can be.
So I have great respect
for where you came from
and how far you got.
Thank you.
But I mistrust it.
I think your presentation
is so buttoned up...
uh-huh.
And for my liking,
a little too buttoned up.
So I'm gonna trust my gut
on this. I'm out.
Okay.
Um...
I like your business.
I like you guys.
Thank you.
So I'll make you
an offer.
I'll give you $1 million.
(Daymond) Whoa.
Wow.
But I want 22%
of the business.
And there's one caveat.
and Peter and Yuen
have an offer on the table.
I'll give you $1 million.
(Daymond) Whoa.
Wow.
But I want 22%
of the business.
There's one caveat.
I want a monthly distribution
prorated to the owners.
In other words, the partners--
Obviously, you are the majors--
We get a check every month
from the free cash
that's coming from franchisees.
Percentage
we can negotiate in the future.
That's the only request
I have,
and you get $1 million.
So you're giving them a value
of $5 million on the business?
Less than. Less than.
(Mark) Less than $5 million.
(Robert) Right.
And on top of that,
he's getting
a check every month...
(Kevin) Well, guys,
I want to tell you something.
To reduce his equity.
I bring a lot of value
to the table here.
I know this space.
Okay.
Not sushi rolling,
But franchise...
Mm-hmm.
And the economics
of investing in this.
I'll force
some disciplines on you
that you'll thank me for
five years from now.
Ha!
Can you--Can you elaborate
a little bit about
what disciplines you might
be alluding to?
(sharks laugh)
All I'm saying is,
the only covenant
I'm putting in place is--
is to make you
more money monthly.
I'm going to sit down
with you and negotiate
what portion
of the free cash flow
that comes from
the royalty stream
goes into your pocket
every month.
So it goes into you guys collectively?
L-listen to what
he just said, though.
But it goes into you
collectively, right?
Listen to what he just said.
He goes--
It goes into you collectively.
No, listen to what
he just said.
He said--Not only is he gonna
undervalue your valuation...
(Kevin) I think actually
what you're hearing here is--
Versus the offer you have.
On top of that, he's taking cash
out of the business upfront.
Mark never--Mark didn't...
(Daymond) But with you.
Think of this structure.
But he's taking the cash out
with you.
That's correct.
(Mark) it doesn't matter!
(Kevin) I said prorated.
But, Kevin, why would they
have a firm offer
for their business at 6.6,
and in their wildest
sake-instilled nightmare...
But, Robert, here's--
Here's what's great about it.
Take your value of $5 million?
It act--It actually doesn't
matter what you think.
I couldn't care less.
It's what they think
that matters.
(laughs)
(Mark laughs) No kidding.
I made you an offer.
It's very simple.
I'll be your partner.
I'm willing to give you
$1 million
for 22% of the company.
It's your vision. It's--
You still control it.
You don't have to give up
control. I don't want control.
I just want a return
on my investment.
Is that too much to ask?
I don't think so.
Are you willing to come down
on your--Your equity portion
to 15%?
I would meet you
in the middle.
Okay.
So you'd do it at 20%...
Yeah.
Roughly?
Are you not, uh, curious
as to how much he wants to take
out of that business monthly?
He has to have some number
in his head.
No, I don't. I-I--
to leave that open-ended?
Because you are actually
getting the lion's share
of what comes out.
That's true.
So I wasn't thinking
about that.
I was thinking that,
you know,
even if we got crammed down
with this offer,
uh, that we would still get
some share
of--of the distribution.
Absolutely.
So can we have a standing offer
so we can discuss?
Absolutely, Yeah.
Thank you.
Standing offer.
That's an aggressive valuation,
Mr. O'Leary.
I like it.
Of course you like it.
So all you want to do
is basically--
No!
All he wants to do
is protect his downside.
Exactly.
They're--they're giving up
their upside
because they think they
can get at least...
he made it sound so good.
A 15% return on their cash,
'cause that's what
their discount was
in their discounted
cash flow model.
I don't need your help
on this one, Mark.
(chuckles)
I figured this one out myself.
I'm not--I'm not
giving you help.
I'm just sayin'--
Yeah, the key
with these guys is,
I think they really need
the cash.
Do you want to punt?
I think so.
You want to punt?
Yeah.
Okay.
I think we have
other opportunities out there.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, here we go.
Before we answer, we just
have a quick question.
How are you gonna help us
with the real estate side,
which has become
very problematic for us?
There is no easy answer
to that.
Even when you have
400 locations,
every new one is a fi--
is a paramount fight.
There's no question
about it.
Right.
Those are
individual negotiations,
every single time.
Right.
Now you don't have a person
doing your real estate
right now, do you?
That is correct.
I am doing it.
Yeah, but, you know,
you can't afford one
till you're past 50 locations.
You just can't.
You're gonna have to do it.
Okay.
That's the answer.
That's fair, yeah.
'cause you're--
You're still too small.
Right.
You're going to reduce
your risk in some ways
by growing a little slower,
I think, whether you take me on
or not as a partner.
Right.
If I were you,
I'd take me on.
(chuckles)
Okay.
(Robert laughs)
Peter, what do you
want to do?
Okay. I mean, if you feel like
that's the right decision.
We'll take your offer.
Whoa.
Wow.
(Barbara) I wasn't sure.
All right.
Kevin, I even started
to believe that crap.
(Kevin) Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Looking forward to it.
It sounds like a great offering.
Thank you so much.
I'm looking forward
to working with you guys.
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Congratulations, guys.
(Yuen) Thank you, all.
(Barbara) Bye-Bye.
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.
(Robert) Good job.
Have a good day.
You made a deal with the devil.
(exhales deeply)
Wow. That was amazing.
That was.
We took Kevin's deal
of $1 million
because ultimately,
we felt like
the strategic alliance
with Kevin
was gonna far outweigh
the other dollars.
