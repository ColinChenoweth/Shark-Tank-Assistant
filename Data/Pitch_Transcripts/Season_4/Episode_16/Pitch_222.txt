My name is Bea Arthur,
and, yes,
that is my real name.
(chuckles)
And I am the founder and C.E.O.
of pretty padded room.
I am asking $100,000
for 30% of my company.
The practice of psychotherapy
has been around for more than
a hundred years,
and it's helped
millions of people,
but it doesn't have
a really wonderful reputation.
See, when most people
think "therapy,"
they imagine paying $200
to be trapped in a room
with this guy.
(elderly male voice)
How does that make you feel?
(laughs)
Creepy, right?
So most of us tend
to solve our problems
"the normal way,"
by confiding
in a trusted friend.
(female voice)
Honey, you don't need him.
You need margaritas.
Oh, yeah.
(Barbara laughs)
She knows you inside and out,
and she's always there for you,
but her advice
isn't always the best.
In order to make counseling
more approachable
and accessible,
I felt we needed to provide
the credentials
of an experienced therapist
with the comfort and ease
of an old friend.
So I broke all barriers
and created
pretty padded room--
a nice place to go crazy.
Pretty padded room Provides
online therapy to women
on their own time
and in their own space.
We connect users
from all around the world
with an all-female team
of licensed therapists
through video chat
or a digital diary
for just a fraction
of the price.
As you can see,
pretty padded room
has transformed
traditional therapy,
completely redefined
the approach,
and is now poised to dominate
in This very important space.
So... How did that pitch
make you feel?
(Kevin) So, Bea,
I can go online
and get a credible,
licensed psychotherapist?
Yes.
What does it cost?
A trial session at $20
is a 30-minute session,
and it's either through
video chat
or our digital diary,
which is where--
And what are you paying
the doctor?
We--It's a flat rate.
So for $20,
they get $16 of that.
For $40, they get $30.
(Kevin) Yeah, it raises
the immediate question--
If a therapist can't
generate their own practice
at 150 bucks an hour,
They'd be a discount therapist,
and they'd go to your deal,
'cause they're getting paid
a whole lot less.
Mm-hmm.
So if I'm a good therapist,
why would I do this?
I was actually trying to solve
two problems with this business.
I really did want to make
therapy more approachable,
and most importantly, affordable
for the average consumer.
Also for new therapists
who are just starting out,
it's actually very difficult
to just hang up a shingle
and just automatically
get clients like that.
Is this only for women?
We're women-oriented,
but we have about 6%
male membership, actually.
It's a subscription-based
service.
There's three tiers
of membership.
$100 is
5 digital diary sessions,
and that's when you can
write in to your therapist.
It's an interactive journal.
$150 is 4
30-minute sessions with video
and one digital diary.
At $200 is 4
45-minute sessions
And three digital diaries.
(Robert) Bea, when I use
the digital diary
to write to a therapist,
am I doing that one-on-one?
I'm basically e-mailing her?
Or am I going through
your computer to do that?
It's through the site, and a lot
of people appreciate that.
It's a virtual office.
I've been working on this for
about two and a half years.
In our very first year,
when we were offering
free sessions,
and I was still working
my full-time job
as a domestic violence
counselor,
we did about $7,500
in sales.
$7,500?
Yes.
(Mark) What was
your average session price?
So we get an idea of the number
of sessions
that people paid for?
The first session
was free.
In the first three months,
about 600 people
did sign up.
600 signed up, and then how many
actually paid for sessions?
Um, originally, uh,
so our conversion rate has
always been right around 40%.
So people who try up,
about 40%
end up going on
and signing up for memberships.
The average customer stays on
for about three to six months.
What are you on course
to do this year?
$21,000,
and we're on track to--
(Barbara) But are you on target?
Yes, at this moment,
we're halfway through
our fiscal year.
(Kevin) But does it bother you,
Bea, that after
basically three years,
right,
you're talking about doing
$20,000 in sales?
I'm not even sure we're
proving the concept here.
I mean, that is absolutely
nothing burger.
(Mark) You've said
that the average customer
is three months?
Three to six months.
So what's the lifetime,
um, revenue value
of the customers
that you've had so far?
Do you know?
The lifetime revenue?
So in other words,
the average customer
is online for three months?
Mm-hmm.
How much revenue are you
typically collecting
from that 3-Month customer?
Between $300 and $500.
So your average--So--
$300 and $600.
I'm sorry?
$300 and $600,
I'm sorry.
Okay, so your--
That--That's a big range,
so it's hard
to get a feel.
Bea, something's not
adding up for me.
You had 600 people come and do
a session the first year.
If all the people
from the first year converted
into paid customers,
you would be doing
$60,000 a year
under
your minimum subscription.
Yes.
But you're doing $15,000.
So the drop-Off rate of people
that use the product once
and don't sign up is huge.
The numbers don't seem
to add up. Robert's right.
You're basically
in an e-Commerce business.
Mm-hmm.
It happens to be your product
is psychotherapy counseling.
It feels to me
like you need a partner
that can explain to me,
'cause you don't seem
to be able to do it,
customer acquisition costs,
margins, attrition--
Which Robert identified
you have a huge attrition rate.
In other words, people come,
use it, and just go away.
That's not--
That's not True at all.
I mean, our customers are
addicted to the site.
Well, then why do you have
no sales?
All of our business has been
through word of mouth.
But you can't answer
one of those questions.
Think about it. If you--
I--
(Robert) Bea, your--
Your numbers aren't adding up.
I mean, I--
they're just not.
You... (sighs) I'm not--
I am a non-Tech entrepreneur.
My background is--
That's your answer?
(huffs)
a non-Tech is a whole lot
different than non-numbers.
I understand that.
I'm building this.
The first two years,
it's been extremely difficult.
The learning curve
is very steep,
but I've learned so much.
And my vision
has been validated.
People are in love
with This site.
We get the--
it gets me high,
the things that people
say about this site,
and I get to help people.
I just need to get clear
on the numbers.
You just said it
right there.
How can you come in here
and say,
"I need to get clear
on the numbers"?
I thought I had a good,
basic understanding of it.
No, you were terrible.
(chuckles)
Terrible.
(Barbara)
Here's my spin--
You have a great thing here,
and I think it's creative
in a fresh way.
And I think it's--
Even has a noble purpose.
Right.
But you did a terrible job
fumbling through the numbers.
Ohh.
But I have good news
for you.
Hmm?
I'm terrible at numbers,
and I'm rich.
(laughs)
All you really need here
is to find the smartest
finance person you know
who has an understanding
of technology
and make them your partner.
If you do that,
I have no doubt in my mind,
you're gonna have
a great business.
But I'm sure not gonna
invest in it today
with that giant question mark
over the numbers.
I'm sad to say I'm out.
Aw. I kind of
felt like--Okay.
Bea, Barbara is wrong.
There are key metrics
to every business
that you have to know.
You can't subcontract that.
No matter if you hire
an accountant or not...
no, just get a partner
is what I said.
There are key numbers
in your business.
(Robert)
When you have ignorance,
you're not defensible.
You can't fight back when you're
ignorant about your numbers.
(sighs)
I'm out.
(Mark)
Bea, your vision's in place.
You've gotten all the accolades
of people who like your site.
You've gotta learn
the language of business.
Otherwise you got no shot.
And you've got
an opportunity here.
Don't blow it,
but I'm out.
(Daymond) So, Bea,
you obviously are doing
what you love
and you have a passion.
But it's scary,
the problem you're having
with the numbers here.
These numbers do not add up.
I'm out.
Well, thank you.
I do appreciate that.
I think what's appropriate
is a very simple story
that I think
you'll appreciate.
There's an island right off
the coast of south africa
where the largest population
of sardines exists.
Seals love sardines.
Hundreds of thousands of them
sit on an island--
Just bare rock,
nothing to eat.
They look at the sardines.
After about seven days,
they start to starve.
But they know
if they go in the water,
the great white Sharks
will eat them alive.
Somebody has to go in the water
from the Seals
to sacrifice their lives
so that the others can live,
eating the sardines.
It's the one
that's starving the most
that goes in first,
followed by maybe
a few thousand more.
The ones that sacrificed their
lives did it for a purpose--
So the D.N.A. of the ones
that live can go on.
So, Bea, do you know
who you are in this story?
You're the first seal
that goes in the water.
The purpose was that others
will never come in here again
without their numbers.
They will learn
from the blood in the waters
that you've provided.
I'm out.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Don't go swimming.
(exhales)
Let that be a lesson.
She's smart.
She'll figure it out.
(voice breaking) I'm here
representing my business,
and I really, really resent
having anybody call my business
or my project
or anything that I've worked
this hard on... horrible.
It isn't.
