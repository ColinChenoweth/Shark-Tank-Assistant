My name is Bea Arthur,
(Kevin) So, Bea,
I can go online
(Robert) Bea, when I use
the digital diary
to write to a therapist,
am I doing that one-on-one?
I'm basically e-mailing her?
Or am I going through
your computer to do that?
(Kevin) But does it bother you,
Bea, that after
basically three years,
right,
you're talking about doing
$20,000 in sales?
I'm not even sure we're
proving the concept here.
I mean, that is absolutely
nothing burger.
(Mark) You've said
that the average customer
is three months?
Three to six months.
So what's the lifetime,
um, revenue value
of the customers
that you've had so far?
Do you know?
The lifetime revenue?
So in other words,
the average customer
is online for three months?
Mm-hmm.
How much revenue are you
typically collecting
from that 3-Month customer?
Bea, something's not
adding up for me.
(Robert) Bea, your--
Your numbers aren't adding up.
I mean, I--
they're just not.
You... (sighs) I'm not--
I am a non-Tech entrepreneur.
My background is--
That's your answer?
(huffs)
a non-Tech is a whole lot
different than non-numbers.
Bea, Barbara is wrong.
There are key metrics
to every business
that you have to know.
You can't subcontract that.
No matter if you hire
an accountant or not...
no, just get a partner
is what I said.
There are key numbers
in your business.
(Robert)
When you have ignorance,
you're not defensible.
You can't fight back when you're
ignorant about your numbers.
(sighs)
I'm out.
(Mark)
Bea, your vision's in place.
You've gotten all the accolades
of people who like your site.
You've gotta learn
the language of business.
Otherwise you got no shot.
(Daymond) So, Bea,
you obviously are doing
what you love
So, Bea, do you know
who you are in this story?
You're the first seal
that goes in the water.
The purpose was that others
will never come in here again
without their numbers.
They will learn
from the blood in the waters
that you've provided.
I'm out.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Don't go swimming.
(exhales)
Let that be a lesson.
She's smart.
She'll figure it out.
(voice breaking) I'm here
representing my business,
