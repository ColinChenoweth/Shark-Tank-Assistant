First up is Carmen Lindner,
selling a delicious new twist
on an old camping favorite.
Hi.
My name is Carmen Lindner,
and I am the founder and c.E.O.
Of gotta have s'more.
I'm here seeking an investment
of $75,000
in exchange for 25% equity
in my company.
Quick show of hands here.
Who likes s'mores?
Me, too.
But you know what I don't like?
Camping.
(sharks laugh)
So I decided to set out
and revolutionize
the dessert industry.
I want to introduce you
to the s'muffin.
The s'muffin is a s'more
in the shape of a mini muffin.
And I promise you have never
seen or tasted
anything
quite like this before.
You don't have to take
my word for it,
'cause you get to try some
right now.
Barbara, I want you
to remember something.
A moment on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.
(Carmen) Oh.
(laughs)
Thank you.
You're welcome.
They sure look yummy, huh?
They are yummy.
Mmm.
So the middle one
is dark chocolate.
There's one that's chocolate
with caramel.
And another half that is...
thank you.
(Carmen) Milk chocolate.
Oh, that's a good one.
(Kevin) Carmen, it's gotta be
a million calories.
It's not
a million calories.
It's only 200 calories,
but I'm not trying
to market these as a fat-free.
And so now that you've tried
your very first s'muffin,
you know why my customers
are constantly coming back,
saying, "Carmen,
I gotta have s'more."
(Robert chuckles)
Okay, Carmen, what--
what are your sales?
My sales to date,
for two and a half year,
are $250,000.
And that's just within
local mark--L.A. market.
What do you think
you're gonna do this year?
This year, my forecast
is to do $165,000.
How do you sell them,
Carmen?
75% of my customers
come direct to me online
or they phone in.
That's been my primary focus
over the first two years.
Do any stores
carry them as well?
So there are a few stores
that carry 'em--
Local specialty bakeries,
wine stores.
(Mark)
How much do you sell it for
and what does it
cost you to make?
Costs me to make--
$9.34 a dozen.
I charge $29.95 a dozen.
We deliver
throughout Los Angeles.
And just recently, I was able to
launch the national shipping.
These are the boxes
that I ship 'em in.
So--
(Barbara)
You ship them frozen?
Ship them frozen.
5 pounds of dry ice
with a cooler.
How much
is that cost for shipping?
Shipping cost alone
is $54.
Whoa.
That's a lot.
Which is high, but...
stop the madness, Carmen.
Let's walk through this.
You've got a dozen little
shmuffins or shmores in there.
And I have to pay 60 bucks
to get them...
(laughs)
To my honey bunny in New York.
All right?
Mm-hmm.
That is, like, 10 bucks
a shmore.
That's right in line
with all my comp--
All my competitors.
Is there anything else
out in the market
comparable to this?
No. This is my baby.
I trademarked
the name "S'muffin."
I didn't want to just
call it a s'more
because honestly, it's so much
more than a s'more.
It's a shmuffin.
It's a s'muffin.
I get it,
but the cost
is freaking me out.
I'm just thinking--
What--what do you think
is expensive?
It's 10 bucks a shmuffer.
(Daymond laughs)
My target market--
They're high-end customers.
They're used to paying
shipping...
(Robert) But why argue
with you, Carmen?
And I'm getting--
You're doing it today. You're
selling them at that price.
Yeah, and--
Not that many.
You haven't sold many shmuffers
at that price.
She sells $165,000 a year.
Are you selling
a lot of product
that costs $60 a box?
Come on.
Yes.
That's crazy.
$50--
Am I the only person
Who says that's insane?
(laughs)
I mean, you fedex this
across the country...
you wouldn't bel--
Or you send your children
to college.
(Mark and Daymond laugh)
You choose one.
You wouldn't--
Like, think about that.
You wouldn't believe
the frenzy
that these things create.
This is
the next dessert craze.
All right, Carmen. I'm not
gonna invest in your shmagels.
I'm out.
(laughs) Sorry, Carmen.
What's your background?
I was an advertising
sales executive.
I was laid off
during the recession.
I got a severance package.
My husband and I
had always dreamed
of starting a s'more store,
and--
What?
I-I never met somebody Who
loves s'mores more than you.
(laughs)
When you say "s'more,"
it brings back
happy memories,
and people
automatically smile.
I see this all the time
at events.
They're like, "Oh, my gosh.
These are unique.
What is this, a cupcake?"
I'm like, "Oh, no.
It's better than a cupcake.
It's a s'muffin."
And then they taste it,
and then just fall over.
Then they order it
and go bankrupt.
(Daymond laughing)
They come back.
They come back
and they order over and over.
My biggest cost
was investing
in getting
the national shipping down.
Why didn't you just
stay local then?
Yeah, like why are you--
if it was gonna cost you
all your money--
'cause I don't want
to stay local.
I want everybody to be able
to have these.
I want s'muffins
and gotta have s'mores...
that's completely
different, though, than--
to be a national name.
That's a whole different thing
than trying to make money.
You have a huge market
in Los Angeles.
Mm-hmm.
And you've got
willing customers.
Why focus on
trying to solve a problem
that's not really
a problem?
This was one focus.
(chuckles)
I'm also now wanting
to start focusing
on wholesaling as well.
(laughs)
Carmen, you're so in love
with your s'muffins,
you can't see the dollars
from the marshmallows.
I'm out.
(Robert) Carmen,
you put yourself in a position
where you have to ask for
$75,000 from us
and give up 25% equity
to fix a problem
that isn't generating
any sales.
All I see is problems.
I see it as building
my distribution.
The s'muffins were good.
I'm out.
Your strategy is, uh,
s'muffin crazy.
So, um, I'm out.
I like nothing more
than a real s'more.
But when I tasted this,
it didn't taste anything
really like it.
So I'm going out just because
I don't like the muffin.
And I feel badly
telling you that.
Okay.
Okay?
But good luck to you.
Thank you.
(Carmen) It was just weird
that they didn't
go bananas over them.
It's almost like I was
in the twilight zone... (laughs)
Because that was--That's not
the typical reaction.
How can there only be
a dozen of them in that box?
'cause it's full of ice.
You're shipping water
across the country.
(sharks laugh)
in season 3, Donny Mccall
failed to get a deal
with the sharks
for his folding cargo system,
invis-a-rack.
I'm committed to making
invis-a-rack
in the United States.
(Kevin) Donny.
Yes, sir.
You can't solve the problem
we're talking about here.
I believe I can make it.
I know I can.
Let's see
what he's up to now.
