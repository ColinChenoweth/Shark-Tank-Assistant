are Brooke Bryant
and Brittany hayes,
who are hoping
to elevate the decor
of children's bedrooms.
Hey, y'all.
We are
the Georgia peaches
behind the next
multimillion-dollar
children's decor company,
Addison's Wonderland.
My name is Brittany Hayes.
And my name is Brooke Bryant.
We are seeking an investment
of $90,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company.
Addison's Wonderland
is the most unique,
versatile, and exquisite
line of children's bedding
on the market today--
So much so
that when moms see it,
they will never want
to buy ordinary again.
When my sweet little Addison
was ready for her first bed,
I started my search
for her big-girl room.
And everything I found
had such Bland colors,
lacked detail,
and most of the selection
just was so plain,
it looked kind of cheap.
So I got out my sketchbook
and started working
on my vision
of the ultimate
little girl's room.
I got to work creating pillows,
window treatments, and bedding.
Addison absolutely
loved her room,
and so did everyone
who saw it.
Brittany and I have been friends
for a really long time,
and I've always believed in her
amazing creativity and design.
So when she asked me
to partner with her,
I didn't think twice.
We are ready
to make Addison's Wonderland
into a brand name
that everyone
will want to have
for their child.
So which of you
wants to team up
with these motivated,
hardworking Southern gals
and become the next
designer home decor empire?
Ladies, no shark is
as fashion-forward as I am.
(laughter)
So is this sold
through retailers,
or are you selling this
all direct online?
Right now we are selling it
direct online.
And you offer it
as a whole piece?
On our web site,
we have what's called
"Build your collection,"
where you can go through,
and it easily kind of
navigates you through.
If you wanna buy
the Addison collection,
you know, you click
the duvet, pillows...
Oh, I see.
And it'll kind of
show you.
Or you can go
to each individual--
like, the pillow section,
and order pillows.
And what would this cost?
A whole bedding set
runs about $1,400
for a twin set.
That's $1,400?
Are you hand-sewing this
yourself at home?
We have a small
custom workroom
that does all
of our work locally,
but that's one of
the reasons we're here,
is to get better
manufacturing options.
Yeah.
'cause that's very expensive
for a child's...
that's another reason.
Bed.
We would like to get
the price point down
to a more reasonable rate.
How long have you
been selling this again?
Exactly a year.
How's it been going?
Good.
We've sold $130,000 so far.
Wow.
And what's your cost
on that $130,000?
Our gross margin right now
is about 55%.
And, Brittany,
what's the average order size?
The average order size has been
between $800 and $1,200.
Whoa.
(Lori) Whoa.
How are people
finding your web site?
We are just--Right now
mainly on social media.
I posted some sneak peeks,
and it just took off.
I mean, we got
hundreds of comments.
And people were like,
"what date
and what time
is this coming out?"
mm-hmm.
That just seems
like so much money to me.
It does to me, too.
So this is a very,
very high-End...
Yes.
Exclusive product line?
Yes. We would like
to get it down
to a little bit less
of a high-End.
If--if that's the market
you're catering to,
and it seems to be
accepting that price point,
why bring the price down?
The feedback we've gotten
is if it were
about 30% lower in price,
we could reach a broader market.
We're kind of--
Isn't the online strategy
a way to keep this
so that you can fulfill
for everybody that wants it?
I mean, maybe this isn't
destined to be a huge business.
Maybe it's meant
to be a profitable one...
right.
Where you just charge people
outrageous prices
for this stuff.
They won't survive that way.
No, that's not true at all.
That's not True at all, Lori.
Kevin, shockingly enough,
is--is right.
Um, you guys
are identifying a niche.
Thousands of people
come to your site.
You're selling to them.
I don't agree with Mark.
I have always based my model
off of making
great quality product
at a great, affordable price
so that it can be enjoyed
by the masses.
The good news is, your model
is not the only model.
And... Wait...
there's lots of other ways
to make money.
Wait, wait, wait.
Mark, I was talking.
Excuse me.
I think that for you
to make a good profit,
you're going to need
to hit the masses.
That's really
the way to go.
You can't--
Mark, there's a recession
going on.
Most people--
They're struggling to just...
$1,400 for a mortgage payment.
Well, I think--
we haven't done any--
and they're saying
they wanna get their price down.
She's out of her mind.
You're asking for $90,000.
I don't know
where he comes from
thinking that he knows
all about the retail world...
you can go into
a mass market with $90,000?
Because he's not even in it.
You're crazy.
Well, I think we would like to
go a little bit more wholesale.
Like, we have
a lot of boutiques
want to put it
in their storefront.
Any specialty chains?
Bellini is one of them.
I remember buying, uh, a crib
for my daughter in Bellini's.
I think I'm just
paying it off now,
and she's almost 18.
(laughs)
Another reason we'd like
to get our cost down
is so that we can
offer a wholesale rate.
But that's a completely
different business
than what you're in now.
You've got end users
willing to pay crazy prices
for colorful sheets
and pillows.
Now you want to start servicing
a distribution business
that wants at least
a 50% margin.
Yeah, you may be trying
to grow too BIG too fast.
You have a good business here.
Yeah. I mean, that's what
we're trying to avoid.
And that's why we're here,
to need your advice.
'cause we feel like...
are you sure you're ready
to bring in
a... a third voice?
Yes.
Definitely.
Just a little background
on me...
okay.
So you know I'm not just,
like, a sew-at-Home mom--
when I was in college,
my husband and I
got married at 20,
and he decided he wanted
to start a granite company.
So I went in with him,
we worked our...
booties off,
and by the time
we were 23,
we graduated from college,
and the company was selling
$2 1/4 million.
I know business.
I really do.
(Daymond) All right.
We may be sweet
Southern girls, but...
Yeah, we can work hard.
We're hard workers...
yes.
And we're motivated
and passionate.
What happened
to that business, Brittany?
It's still in business.
I-I... you know, I think--
I think you're on
the right track.
Your first year in,
you've done $130,000 in sales,
and you're profitable.
You know, in some ways,
you have the perfect business.
Not sure I agree
with the strategy
of going away from that.
Not a market I understand.
I'm out.
I will say I-I love
your creativity,
and I think
that you will go far.
But I'm more
interested in products
that, uh, can be affordable
by most of the population,
as opposed to just a few.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
I really don't think
you need us.
I think this is a business
that you could run
out of your home,
you can make
a couple hundred thousand,
maybe even a million,
and you can grow
the business like that.
I wouldn't be of any assistance
to you. I'm out.
Here's what
Mr. Wonderful says--
There's nothing unique
or proprietary about it.
You're wonderful Southern girls.
I get all that.
But frankly,
if I wasn't so wonderful,
and I wanted
to knock this off,
I could do it
for a lot less.
This is the brutal reality
of business.
So I'm out.
Mark? (chuckles)
(chuckles)
As someone who's going through,
right now,
redoing the rooms
for a 6-year-old
and a 9-year-old daughter,
I'm getting brutalized
with all this stuff, right?
And so my wife would love it.
And I recognize
that it's relatively expensive,
but there's a market there
as well.
But a lot of investors,
when they look at an investment,
they look at R.O.I.--
return on investment.
I look at R.O.T., you know?
Return on my time.
What are you gonna do, Mark?
You know your daughters
would love this.
Yes, they would love it.
(laughs)
You're gonna kill me.
Um...
I love the way these ladies
are pulling your heartstrings.
(women laugh)
Just think--You could design
your daughter's room,
on your own.
Go online...
yes. You could do this.
I'm thinking.
You're fine.
Take your time.
Evaluating.
I mean, I like
what you guys are doing.
If you were
half a million in sales
or a million in sales,
then, you know,
then we could say, "Okay,
this is gonna result
in me making
"X" Amount of dollars.
It's just gotta
be worth my time.
And I think
you guys don't need me.
I think we do, though.
We--we do.
Our sales have doubled
in the last six months.
I think you guys
are gonna do wonderful things.
I think you don't
have to rush it.
I'm-a say I'm out.
No.
Shocking, but true.
Yeah, I didn't
see that coming.
Thank y'all so much
for your time...
Thank you so much.
Thank you, guys.
And encouragement.
(Lori) Good luck with everything.
You guys
will do very, very well.
And if you need help
with your daughter's room...
yes, call us.
I would be more than happy.
Trust me, I'm taking notes,
and I'm gonna give it
to my wife.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
All right. Thank y'all.
Thank y'all.
Good luck.
(Robert)
Who can afford $1,400?
(Kevin) Apparently,
many people.
At least $130,000
worth of people so far.
Look, there's nothing wrong
with what they're doing,
but that's never
gonna get big.
It's crazy.
They'll be fine.
Having the five sharks say
that we didn't need them
was a little bit
of a disappointment.
We definitely
wanted a deal.
But it was actually
a great boost of confidence,
'cause we know
that we can do it without them.
