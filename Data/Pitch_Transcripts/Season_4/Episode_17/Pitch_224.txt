are Megan Jackson Carreker
and Aimee Miller,
with a favorable staple
in women's fashion.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Megan Jackson Carreker.
And I'm Aimee Miller.
We're Texas girls.
Our company's hip chixs,
and we're seeking $150,000
for 35% equity in our company.
Hip chixs is a fun
and sexy premium denim line,
and we think that this is
the best butt
that money can buy.
Megan and I
were sorority sisters
and best friends
at Baylor university.
Aw.
We're completely
obsessed with denim.
I mean, you wouldn't catch me
on a day not wearing jeans.
I even own 75 pairs.
Whoa.
But who could blame her?
Jeans are the ultimate
American fashion staple.
And we couldn't
find a perfect pair
to fit every occasion.
You know,
day and night...
Dressy, casual...
that was comfortable,
breathable, sexy and slimming.
So we set out
to create the perfect pair.
Hip chixs is highlighting
the sexiness
of a woman's natural body
with our angled pocket
and our curved yoke--
Are gonna help your backside
look more trim.
And no more muffin top.
(Megan and Amy laugh)
Aah...
you don't want that.
I guess Mark's out.
Oh! I am muffin-Top-Free,
I'll tell you.
We also have a specialized
waistband in the back
which is gonna keep it
from riding down
when you bend over,
so not to reveal
the dreaded whale tail.
(Robert) don't!
(laughter)
I've never heard that before.
You call that a whale toe?
A whale tail.
Whale tail.
Whale tail.
Whale tail.
We see hip chixs becoming
the next hottest,
sought-after
premium denim lines
that every woman
will want in her closet.
We're at our tipping point.
Hip chixs needs your help
to really scale us
to that national level.
And like we love
to say in Texas...
(together)
Y'all want some of this.
(Daymond laughs)
(laughs)
Are you wearing them?
Yes.
Yes.
Because I just want to see
why your jeans stop whale tail
and muffin top.
Why is this different?
Just because it stretches?
No, because usually,
waistbands are, like,
more of a circular,
and ours is kind of an angle,
so we have a little bit
more length back here,
so that when you do bend down,
it's not gonna show everything.
And then muffin top--
What if--What if
you have a couple rolls?
It's a really forgiving fabric.
It's really slimming.
Do you have any sales?
We do. We have
$12,000 worth of sales.
Oh.
Megan, there's gotta be a story.
Why only $12,000?
Why are you here?
Well, we--We originally
created a test.
We did two years of research.
Basically, we wanted
to meet the need in the market.
So we met with boutiques
and said, "what's selling,
and what are you lacking?"
and we designed for that,
and we created
a premium product, meaning...
in 1 year, $12,000.
Yes. Yes.
In 1 year, $12,000.
Off of 300 pairs.
So once Kevin gives you
the $150,000,
tell me what the next
12 months are gonna look like.
What we wanna do with the money
is drive sales.
So we've got
to build a sales force.
We have to develop
more product.
We only created two styles,
so we need more styles.
I don't wanna discount
the $12,000.
But if you got the investment,
what would the sales be
and how would you get them?
So over the next 12 months,
we're hoping to be
around $850,000 revenue.
And how are you gonna do that?
Through boutiques.
So, I mean,
we'd love to do more P.R.,
marketing.
The exposure we've had
so far in the last year,
we haven't spent
one dime on it.
How did those
300 units selling
compare to other jeans?
So at--at this boutique,
they've got over
30 brands of jeans,
and we were within
their top 25% Sellers.
How much do these jeans
retail for?
$187.
And how much do you
sell it to the store for?
Wow.
We sell for $80.
And how much
do you make it for?
$68.
It's $68.
$68, and you sell it
for $80?
Mm-hmm.
Because--
You are going to hell.
Well, we...
exactly.
We add the premium charge.
We wanted to flip
our profit margin
by ordering bigger.
You're making no money.
That's--That's why
we're here.
That's--Yeah.
We want to place
a bigger order, so...
so the cost...
I have to go
to hell with you?
That's why you're here?
No, you're gonna go
on This great journey with us.
It'll be so much fun.
We're gonna paint the town red.
This is my space,
and most of the jean players
are trying to bring
their jean price down to $120.
Because the days
of $180, $220...
it's--It's really over.
Right now people can't pay
their mortgages.
They're--they're wearing
that favorite pair of jeans
forever now.
Daymond, if I came to you,
and I said,
"Let's launch a denim brand.
"Let's hire a designer,
and I want to fund it.
Here's a check."
You tell me what that check
has to be for
for me to get 1% market share
in the next 5 years.
To launch a denim line?
$5 million.
I'm in.
(laughter)
You didn't ask
for enough money!
That's the problem!
That's it! I knew it.
(laughs)
Look, you're--You're
incredibly nice people.
You've done a great job
with your presentation.
What?!
I just don't think
one store is enough.
I'm out today.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
I think that you need
a lot of money,
and I think it's really
too high a hill to tackle.
But you're a designer.
Design something else.
Do something
unique and different,
where you don't have
a lot of competition.
And then have something where
you're cornering the market,
and people will back you,
and you can
get out there quickly.
So that's my recommendation.
And I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.
If I were you, I would take
100, 200 pair of jeans,
and because women
are obsessed with the fit,
every single female star
in the world
thinks they can be
a designer tomorrow,
and they know nothing about it.
You mail 200 pair of those
out to each individual person,
and you tell them you want
to partner up with one of them,
believe it or not,
one of them may say,
"This is such
an incredible pair.
Yes, I'll partner up
with you."
And then you take that
to a... a shark,
and they will die
to give you the money.
It's just that simple.
Hmm.
But today...
I'm out.
That hurt.
So anybody else?
If you can make
a woman's tushie
look significantly better
than anybody else's,
you're gonna be able
to build a following of people
who will pay a premium, who are
waiting for your next product.
It's gonna take longer,
it's gonna be slower,
the margins won't be
as--As strong,
but you can get there.
I'm not the right person
to help you.
But I'm telling you,
do not quit.
It's not about spending
$5 million.
It's just about
grinding it out and doing it.
So I wish you guys
nothing but the best.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mark is doing you
a huge disservice.
No.
Let me speak, Mark.
Your probability of success
in this market is zero.
So the more time you spend
pursuing this dream,
the more you'll be wasting
your precious time.
If you're truly entrepreneurs,
go find something where
the probability of success
is more than zero.
No chance that you will get
share in the Jean business.
I'm out.
(Robert)
Megan, Aimee, thank you.
Good luck.
(sighs)
Man, you gotta
learn to be...
are you guys kidding?
You gotta learn
to be nicer to people.
What?!
why crush their dreams?
I mean, give...
because it's--It's not
a dream, it's a nightmare, Lori.
It's--
You're mean
and nasty, Kevin.
It's the truth.
Anything else
under the Hood?
It's the truth.
Thank goodness I'm here.
I'm proud of what we've done.
300 pairs to develop
and sell is amazing.
We have--We have something.
Nobody goes out
and buys something
they've never heard of for $200
because it isn't great.
It is great.
