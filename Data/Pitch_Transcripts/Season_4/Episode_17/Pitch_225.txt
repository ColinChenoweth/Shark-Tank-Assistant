We're really excited
to introduce our product
to America.
We think that
it's really gonna change
the way that people
look at wood.
We need an investment
from the sharks
because proof
is growing so fast.
We need the capital
to invest in inventory
Hi, sharks. I'm Brooks...
I'm Tanner...
Tanner, tell me about the logo.
What's the significance?
How'd you come up with that?
Really, when we started proof,
we actually wanted to give back
in what we did,
(Taylor) We'll be back.
We'll regroup here a second.
Thanks.

I really like them.
They're gonna be
