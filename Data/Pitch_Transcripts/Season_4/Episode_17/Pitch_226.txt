I'm Brooks...
I'm Taylor...
and I'm Tanner.
We're brothers
from Boise, Idaho,
and we're the owners of Proof.
(beeping)
Hey, dad. What's going on?
Hi, guys.
Got a load
of, uh, ponderosa pine
from central Oregon.
(Taylor) 60 years ago, our
grandfather started Woodgrain,
a wood products
manufacturing company
that's still in our family today
and run by our dad.
So we decided to incorporate
a family tradition
and start Proof--
The next generation
in our family business.
(buzzing)
Our product's made from wood,
which makes it
completely unique.
So we can guarantee
our customer
that they have a one-of-a-kind,
handmade original.
(Brooks)
We're really excited
to introduce our product
to America.
We think that
it's really gonna change
the way that people
look at wood.
We need an investment
from the sharks
because proof
is growing so fast.
We need the capital
to invest in inventory
to keep up with
the demand of our customers.
We have a lot
riding on this deal.
Proof is a family company
that we hope to pass on
to our children one day.
So this means
the world to us.
Hi, sharks. I'm Brooks...
I'm Tanner...
and I'm Taylor,
and we're the Dame brothers
from Boise, Idaho.
Our company is Proof eyewear.
We are seeking an investment
of $150,000
for a 10% share
in our innovative company.
At Proof,
we create the most amazing
one-of-a-kind
handcrafted eyewear
from the most sustainable
woods available.
As we have grown, we have added
other eco-friendly frames
from materials such as
plant-based plastics
and recycled
skateboard decks.
I started Proof in my garage
a little over a year ago.
As Proof started getting
more and more popular
and started showing up
on famous people's faces
and in International
publications around the world,
it became more than I could
handle by myself,
and I needed some help
in a major way,
so I brought these two guys in
to help me out.
For me, really,
it was a no-brainer,
because, "a,"
I can trust them,
I knew their work ethic.
Heck, I used to give these guys
wedgies when they were little.
(laughter)
And, "B," you know,
they work for cheap.
So that's a win-win, right?
In addition to that,
our family's been
in the wood business
for a real long time.
We like to joke that we have
sawdust in our veins.
We bought each shark
their own personalized pair
of proofs they can check out.
We even engraved
with your names in 'em.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Kevin, they've got,
uh, spring hinges,
so they'll even fit
big heads like yours.
(Robert) Let me see, Kevin.
Let's see.
(laughs)
You look ridiculous.
We got him
some green lenses, too.
The color of money.
Daymond, let me see yours.
Let's see.
Oh, yours are cool.
Mark, you look ridiculous.
(laughs)
He's ready
for a night on the town.
You guys are looking stylish.
That's all I can say
right now.
Please note the uniqueness
of the wood grain.
No two trees
are exactly alike, right?
Making no two pairs of Proofs
exactly alike.
This makes your pair
a one-of-a-kind,
handmade original.
Over six decades ago,
our grandfather
took his small Wood sawmill
from a one-man show
to becoming
a very successful business.
With his example
of hard work,
dedication, and creativity,
we're prepared
to take proof
from three brothers
from Idaho
to becoming a major success
in the eyewear industry.
Entrepreneurs like us
don't grow on trees...
(Robert laughs)
Even though the majority
of our products do.
Speaking of things
that grow on trees,
we need your money
to make this dream come true.
Sharks, who's gonna become
part of the Proof family?
Do you have any sales?
Yeah, we've sold a little bit.
Uh, in the last 12 months,
we've had $433,000
worth of sales.
Whoa.
Wow, that's good.
Yeah, not bad.
You don't seem proud of that.
We're very proud of that.
You know, it's, uh, it's...
but you're kind of, like,
"Oh, Gee, shucks..."
we gotta be humble.
We're from humble beginnings.
We're from Idaho.
We're humble boys.
But we work hard.
You should be proud of that.
How did you sell that?
$433,000--
How did you sell that?
Grassroots marketing.
Uh, we've gone to trade shows.
And, uh, it really comes down to
the product really sells itself.
What does it cost
to manufacture
the case, the glasses,
the lens?
What is your--your cost?
The cost with the packaging
and the sunglasses is $14.
What do you sell it
to a retailer for?
Around $50 wholesale,
and $100 retail.
What celebrities and what
magazines did you get in?
That's a great question.
It's a good question.
We've been on, uh,
Snoop Dogg's face,
Beyonce, Kelly Rowland...
Shannon Brown.
And they endorsed them?
We've gotten tweets--
We don't send the product out
and say, like, "Hey, will you
wear these and endorse us?"
you just saw them
wearing them?
It just happens.
We've had a budget of zero
for our marketing,
but we hustle a lot.
Wood is extremely hot
right now.
Crazy.
You're absolutely right.
Everybody's doing chains,
they're doing watches.
So you guys
are the official "Wood guys"?
right?
We're the woodies, you know?
We're the wood brothers.
There are other wood sunglasses.
I've seen them, right?
Oh. Plenty, yeah.
What we've really
strived to do
is really build a brand
around the product.
Tanner, tell me about the logo.
What's the significance?
How'd you come up with that?
Really, when we started proof,
we actually wanted to give back
in what we did,
and so we're working on building
an eye clinic in India.
And so part of our sales
that we have,
we--we donate
to this eye clinic in India.
For us, the idea
behind the bird logo
is everybody
has wings to fly.
Sometimes they just need
a little help...
Oh.
To catch flight.
It's a great story.
It's nice.
$433,000 last year.
What do you think
your sales will be this year?
I think we're gonna do about
$850,000 to $900,000 in sales.
On the $433,000
that we've sold,
$150,000 is profit.
What we're doing, really,
is putting a lot of the money
back into inventory.
I mean, I'm not
taking a salary,
and these two guys
are working--
I mean,
they could make more money
working at Mcdonald's, really.
Is this your only job?
I have a full-Time job.
I work in
our family's business,
in the wood business
full-Time.
You know, I've sold millions
of dollars of glasses.
I don't know if you--if you're
aware of that or not.
We're big fans, yeah.
And I'm partners with a large
company that makes sunglasses.
And I'm afraid it's going
to be a conflict for me
with that partnership.
And as much
as I love you guys,
I'm gonna have to be out.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks, Lori.
What are you here looking for
to get to that next
jump-off point?
What we're really looking for
is money for inventory.
We actually have
a small problem--
I don't know if it's a problem.
It's an opportunity--
Where one of
our biggest retailers
has come to us,
and they wanna expand with us.
We've gotta get
our inventory on point.
Who's the retailer,
and what's the order?
Pacific Sunwear.
Pacific Sunwear.
Yeah, exactly.
Is the--
we initially started,
um, in five stores.
And within two weeks,
they got back to us,
and said, "Hey,
we're gonna do ten."
and then they just recently
got to us last week
and said, "Hey, we need
to open--Open 50 stores
for the holiday season."
And that equates
to an order of over $200,000.
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah, but, guys, when
you're turning your sales
at a relatively slow rate,
you can slow down
your customers,
which you've been able to do.
But once it starts to sell,
and there's other people
knocking on the door,
and they're saying, "guys,
if you can't hit this order
"for 150 pairs
for a thousand stores.
I gotta take it
somewhere else"...
you got a problem.
What are you gonna do?
Maybe the answer to that is
structuring a deal
with one of you
where you say, "Okay,
you have--You have access
to more capital if needed."
So what you're saying is,
"come on, guys.
Give us more."
And free sunglasses for life.
Free sunglasses for life.
And sunglasses for life?
Yeah, but they're not
saying that, mark.
You're saying that.
I love the sunglasses,
but I'm out.
Thanks, mark.
If you went to general retail,
like a Costco,
does that kill the brand today?
I-I would say so.
I mean, at the beginning,
we didn't wanna grow super fast.
(Daymond) The good news is
that in a down economy,
where apparel
and everything is horrible...
Yeah.
Oh, for sure.
You guys are actually getting
interest from Pacsun, right?
Right.
So that's great.
You're cool.
Thank you.
I've had a lot
of cool companies.
Heatherette was
my most famous company
that I've owned
that was really, really cool.
But the problem is--was all
the cool brands are broke.
Most people would say,
"I don't wanna ever
be in Walmart."
I'm dying to be in Walmart.
Um, so we wouldn't have
the same vision.
I wish you luck.
I'm out.
Thanks, Daymond.
Thanks, Daymond.
Wow. The cool, hip...
Cool is not hip.
I thought you'd be
all over this.
Cool and a profit
are two different things.
I'm already cool and hip.
That's true.
(laughter)
Well, here's something
I'll throw out at you--
I'll give you the $150,000
for 25%.
I want $2.50 per order...
Hell, no!
Until I get my capital back.
And then it drops to a dollar.
Mr. Wonderful
is also the undertaker.
I don't want
to fund inventory with equity.
I want my equity because
I'm getting involved
in a business I'm gonna
be with for a few years.
That way, I get a constant,
you know, return of my capital.
I'm a quarter-Partner
with you guys,
and I've funded the business.
All right,
so there's an offer--
You get
the $150,000 today,
that's gonna fill one order.
When you wake up tomorrow,
what's the plan then?
You gotta be very careful
about taking
anything off the top
of your gross,
and then paying it out
to somebody at this point.
What is this,
"advice tank?"
(laughter)
Or are you gonna
make 'em an offer?
So I'll give you
the $150,000 for 25%.
No royalty,
because that's ridiculous
at this point in your company.
Kevin and Robert have each
offered the Dame brothers
$150,000 for 25%
of their company.
However, Kevin also
wants a royalty
on each pair of glasses sold.
Well, guys, you got
two offers on the table.
Gotta make
a decision, guys.
Yeah.
And you have sharks
fighting for you.
Let me reiterate
the offers--
Let me--so it's $150,000
for 25% from me.
I'll give you
$150,000 for 25%.
Robert's deal--
That's it.
Mine--
I get $2.50 per order
until my capital
is returned,
then it drops to a dollar.
How is your order
better than Robert's?
It's always better
when you have me.
Difference
between Mr. O'Leary and I--
I don't shuffle money around
on wall street
and take a few bucks.
I built a $100 million business
in record time.
Mr. Wonderful knows
the life cycle of cash.
We don't know what's gonna
happen to this thing.
In my structure,
I get my capital back
in about 14 months.
I'm happy with that.
After that, I drop out...
Look, guys, I'm not--I'm not
really worried
about getting
my capital back today.
Well, I always worry
about my capital.
I think a real investor
worries about
growing the company.
I know if you grow
the company,
and we have
a successful company,
we'll all get our money back.
To--to put in
an investment at this point,
and your primary reason
and worry is,
"how do I get my few Pennies
back along the way?"
I mean, that's ridiculous.
It's--That's ridiculous, too.
You know, let me
tell you something...
(laughs)
You guys should be taking some
off the table every month,
because you don't know
what's gonna happen.
That's ridiculous!
Why would you--
He doesn't understand
the cycle of cash.
Look, I-I know
how to scale a business.
I know how to grow it quickly.
The more successful
you are,
the more capital
you're gonna need.
That's the challenge
of inventory-Based growth.
Anyways, I've made you
an offer.
What do you think
about it?
We appreciate the offers,
and...
Let us--Let us make
a phone call.
All right.
And, uh...
(Taylor) We'll be back.
We'll regroup here a second.
Thanks.
(whistling)
I really like them.
They're gonna be
too cool for school.
This is
a ride-the-wave business.
Hey, pops. How we doing?
Hey, Brooks, how are ya?
Good I'm here
with Tanner and Taylor,
and, uh, we've got
two offers on the table
that we wanted to get--
Get your opinion on.
Ah, great. Congratulations.
Thanks.
I think they're on to something.
I think this is a hot wave.
You ride it for a while,
and you hope you figure it out.
I would never do this deal
without my capital
being returned, ever.
Boy, what are
they gonna do?
The advantage of taking on
a partner
is the additional
working capital is good...
Mm-hmm.
And the expertise is good.
Obviously, the downside
is you dilute your ownership.
Appreciate it, pops.
Love ya.
We love you. Bye-Bye.
See ya.
All right, let's go.
Well, we talked
to the old man.
You know, he gave us
some good advice.
Would either of you guys
be willing to--
to up--up the amount?
'cause, I mean, you're basically
valuating our company
at $600,000.
We got $433,000
of sales today.
I think our company's worth
more than $600,000.
Now you're getting smart.
(Robert) Hallelujah.
Our grandpa
started with nothing.
I mean, the guy
used to be a truck driver.
He would mold wood,
and then take it to California
on the weekend,
and then flip back around
and mold wood all week,
and then take it back down.
So he's just a hustler.
He's about
building the business.
Our dad is the C.E.O.
of the company today,
and our--Our family
is about building business
and supporting people.
I mean, our family business,
we have...
(voice breaking) 17...
1,700 people
that... (laughs)
1,700 people that we support.
And so, you know, we started
out with three people,
and we have seven people
in our business,
and we wanna...
man, I don't know.
We're about making, uh,
making this thing go.
And we wanna build it
with a good partner
that supports us and wants to
see this thing be successful.
Make a counteroffer.
That's why
it's called a "Shark Tank."
Uh, Robert, would you
be willing to, uh,
go to $200,000
for 20% equity in the company?
I think that's
a fair valuation of our--
of our company at this point.
So you want him
to up his cash
and reduce his ask?
Correct.
And we'd also like
to kind of understand
if you'd be willing
to help us going forward
getting financing
if--If necessary.
Well, uh, you've asked
for two concessions from me--
more cash, less equity.
Of course I'm gonna
help you find the funding.
Of course I'm gonna help you
with advice.
I'm gonna stick
to the $150,000 and 25%.
Okay.
What do you guys think?
