Hi. I'm Steve Maloney,
president of Muddy Water Camo.
And today,
we are seeking $150,000
for a 5% equity
in our business.
Sharks, we have created a new
process of making camouflage
that's going to revolutionize
the hunting industry.
The whole purpose of camouflage
is to help the person wearing it
blend into the environment.
Now Bubba over here
is wearing a sample
of where camo started.
Does that look like
the real outdoors to you?
No.
Of course not.
As an obsessed duck hunter,
I kept asking,
"where's the camo that looks
like the places where I hunt?"
after 30 years
of searching for camo
that actually looked like
a real marsh,
I finally decided I'm just
gonna have to make it myself.
(duck call quacking)
(laughter)
That's when he called me.
Hee-Haw!
(Lori laughs)
I'm Stephen Kirkpatrick.
I've been a professional
wildlife photographer
for over 30 years now.
My profession demands
that I stay hidden.
So I've been searching
for more realistic camo myself.
So together, we set out
to create one.
And now, five years later,
it's finally here.
Introducing Muddy Water Camo.
Here's me in muddy water.
Where?
(Lori) Yeah.
I'm-a have to help you out
here a little bit.
Here I am...
and here's Stephen.
(Lori) Wow.
(Mark) Where'd you go, Waldo?
(Stephen) Muddy water
is photographic camo.
It is created outdoors,
where hunting happens,
as opposed to indoors,
on some kind of computer screen.
The entire pattern
is 100% in focus,
and therefore 100% realistic,
just as nature appears
to a bird's eye.
We have found the way
to make camo real.
Hey, and forget
the salt water.
We're gonna put the sharks
in muddy water.
(laughter, duck call quacks)
(laughter)
So, boys, are you basically
photographing a terrain,
and then taking that image
and putting it onto cloth?
Is that what's really
going on here?
Basically, that's the way
we do it.
It's about a 54-Step process,
believe it or not.
Would anybody like a hat?
(Lori) Yes.
(Robert) Oh, of course.
Sure, if it's free.
Thank you.
Sure.
Here's a hat, Daymond.
Thank you.
Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's go back
to why you're doing this.
Let's assume a fact here.
Okay.
Ducks are birds.
Right.
They got bird brains.
(laughs)
They fly over hunters
every day.
They get blasted out of the sky.
That happens every day.
Now are you saying
to me as an investor,
"I can blast more ducks."
Right.
"20% more ducks die
because of this technology"?
it's gonna hide you better.
Are you selling the technology
to camo companies,
or are you actually
selling your own garments
with your camo on it?
We are selling both.
Okay.
What are your sales,
Steven, so far?
So far this year,
they're $150,000.
Your sales, total?
Our--Our sales total
This year.
Now, it--This is
a seasonal business,
and we have not made it
to our first season yet.
So I tell you,
you've done a very good job
of camouflaging your valuation.
Well...
(Lori laughs)
in fact, you've done such
a good job of camouflaging it,
Kevin didn't pick up on it.
They're not worth $3 million?
Oh, you did catch that.
I hadn't got
to that yet.
How did you get
to the $3 million?
We have to look at
the size of the market.
(Kevin) Yep.
Try to figure out
how--How much of it--
Never heard that before.
How much of it
we can capture.
Okay.
We had to produce our products
and get to the market.
How much money
have you put in so far
to produce the product
and get to where you are?
Uh, there's $600,000
invested in the product.
Whoa.
And where'd you get that?
Your money?
We have already raised money
with other investors.
Oh...
and what value
did they put on the company?
They put $2 1/2 million
on the business
before we sold anything.
Come on.
(Stephen)
We didn't have clothing.
All we had was
a piece of material.
Now these people
are hunters, now,
they've been hunting
their whole life,
and they look
at what we have...
really?
Yes.
This is unbelievable.
and you said, "suckers..."
I mean, "investors..."
(Steve laughs)
No, seriously,
you said, "guys,
"here's how big
we think we can be
within 'x' number of years."
What did you tell them?
We think we could take our sales
within the first three years
to $3 million.
Where are you selling
right now?
We have 58 different
retail stores
around the country right now
that are selling our products.
Are you in any
of the big boys--
Dick's, gander mountain...
Bass pro?
Bass pro shops?
We are not,
and one of the reasons is
we knew we were brand-New,
and if we'd have knocked
on Dick's
or cabela's or whatever's door,
they wouldn't have known
who we are,
and they're gonna
license proven products.
If you compare what we have
to what's on the market,
it is
an absolute no-brainer.
I get that it's different.
Okay.
Right? I get that it's,
you know, more innovative.
Sure.
But that
doesn't necessarily mean
people are going to buy it.
You have to be telling me
that you're gonna get bubba
and what bubba typically wears
and put them out of business,
and own 100% of the market.
We don't have to own
100% of the market
to get to a value
of $3 million.
But you've gotta be
changing the game.
Not even close.
You've gotta
change the game.
Waterfowl hunters
spend $400 million on gear
a year, okay?
So I can get $3 million
without putting anybody
out of business.
Look, I'm not a duck Hunter.
I don't have to know your
business to be a good investor.
But, man...
a $3 million valuation?
For a pattern that looks
a little different in my eye?
Definitely not
the right investor. I'm out.
Thank you.
You will sell this.
This is a great idea.
But you came in
asking for too much.
I'm out.
You are out of
your minds.
(Stephen and Steve laugh)
$3 million dollars
is, you know, that price...
(Mark) But $2.5 million isn't.
(quacks)
Exactly. That's where
that price is.
Shucky ducky quack quack.
I'm out.
I think the biggest risk,
actually,
is not the quality
or the success
or the opportunity.
It's that
you've got 16 investors.
I'm gonna be a pimple
on a duck's Butt at 5%.
(Stephen and Steve laugh)
It's just not worth it.
Big pimple.
I'm out.
You know, I'm not interested
in your retail strategy.
I'm interested
in your licensing strategy.
I am the king
of licensing strategies.
If you want to become
the standard,
as mark said earlier,
change the game...
you're exactly right.
You've gotta grow very quickly,
and you've gotta get
the top three guys
to license this from you,
and that's where I am gonna
come in really handy.
I'll give you $150,000
for 20%. Very fair.
(laughs)
Very reasonable.
And let's go
kill some ducks.
We're not gonna take
a valuation
that's lower
than what we already have.
Do you have a counteroffer?
Uh, you probably don't even
wanna hear it.
I'm out.
Thank you, guys.
Thanks, guys.
Congratulations.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Appreciate it.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
(Lori) Bye. Good luck.
All right.
Hey, sharks,
you're bird-brains for not
investing in this company.
(quacking)
