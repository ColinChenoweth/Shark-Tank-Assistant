Haynes: Cinderella's proof
that one pair of shoes
can change your life.
Narrator:
If the sharks hear a great idea,
they're ready to invest
using their own money.
HAYNES:
My name is Jessica Haynes,
My name is Jessica Haynes,
creator of jeska shoe company.
I'm asking for $70,000
in exchange for a 30% stake
in my company.
I've created a product
that allows women to change
the look of their shoes
But, Jessica,
there's another thesis here,
He said, "Jessica,
if you don't take a risk,
you never get the reward."
So, Jessica, why don't you
focus on the one attribute
to your deal
that you haven't addressed
Jessica, I'm gonna make it
a little bit easier.
I just don't know anything
about the business,
so partnering with me
isn't gonna help you.
I have no idea.
I mean, I stopped wearing
shoes like that a long time ago.
[ laughs ]
but I'm out.
Thank you.
I have a price question.
Okay.
So, you're gonna be selling this
shoe with one heel for $200.
If you want a second heel,
what's that consumer
gonna pay for it?
Daymond is Jessica's last chance
to make a deal.
I have a great idea.
I know I do.
The interchangeable-Product
market is making millions,
Jessica,
what do you want to do?
A small portion of a big thing
is a lot better
than a big portion
of a small thing.
So, I take your deal.
All right! There you go.
See that?
Wow.
I got a lot of work
cut out for me.
But I'm gonna be
willing to learn.
All right.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate
all of y'all's feedback.
I really do.
Thank you.
[ sighs ]
to have a partner like that with
that much industry knowledge,
all of the contacts that I could
never even dream of getting,
