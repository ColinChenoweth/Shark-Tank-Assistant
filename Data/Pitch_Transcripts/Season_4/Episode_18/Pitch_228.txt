First up are Neil Cameron,
Hi, sharks.
I'm Neil Cameron.
I'm Peter Ferreira.
Cameron: Yep.
What are the sales?
So, we've actually started
selling about five months ago.
We've been open
a little less than a year.
To date,
we have $100,000 in sales.
Wow.
The valuation is
where it is

Mm-hmm.
Dennis,
I'll give you this.
It is a great name.
You guys are big guys.
You work out, obviously.
Cameron: I'd love
to have Robert in, too, but --
It's too much.
It's too much.
Herjavec:
These guys are tough.
They're gonna
negotiate us up.
You start at 35%,
we're gonna end up at 25%.
Let's just see

Here they come.
Cool it.

We've worked
unbelievably hard,
Cameron: Thank you.
Have a good one.
Killed it.
Pete.
John: You know what I loved
about them?
They didn't get caught up

a quarter million dollars
for peanut butter?
Yes.
