Haynes: Cinderella's proof
that one pair of shoes
can change your life.
Narrator:
If the sharks hear a great idea,
they're ready to invest
using their own money.
Your branding and packaging
is terrific.
And they'll fight each other
for a piece of the action.
Let me ask you a question,
all right?
I just want
to finish up --
Let me ask you guys a simple --
I want to finish --
Barbara,
you're driving me crazy.
Excuse me.
You're driving me crazy.
But first, the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
I have a great idea.
I know I do.
I just don't think
I trust you.
Narrator: It's sink...
there are a lot of things
that sell that don't work.
...or swim.
I don't have all the answers.
That's the plan?
Uh...
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?
They're self-Made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
HAYNES:
My name is Jessica Haynes,
and I'm from the small town
of Emerson, arkansas.
Growing up in a small town
is great.
Everyone is like family,
and family is important to me.
I wouldn't be where I am today
without them.
My family is very fun.
We love being outdoors
and doing things together.
My family is part of who I am.
They give me the confidence
to make crazy, risky decisions
like starting my own company.
Cheers
to family dinners on Sunday.
Yay.
Cheers.
My product is
a fashion accessory
that allows women
to transform their outfit
to match any occasion.
Okay, so it should be
mid next week?
My business is in the start-up
phase with only a prototype.
I'm trying
to secure an investment
so I can move forward
with manufacturing
and start selling my product.
I've been turned down
by countless investors.
The sharks are my last hope.
Hey, y'all.
My name is Jessica Haynes,
creator of jeska shoe company.
I'm asking for $70,000
in exchange for a 30% stake
in my company.
I've created a product
that allows women to change
the look of their shoes
as easily and as often
as we change our mind.
Imagine a seven-Day vacation.
This is just a lady's shoe bag,
and for you, gentlemen,
that means you're lugging
this precious cargo
half a mile
through the airport.
Now, imagine if you can sell
that same woman
one pair of shoes that would
match all of her outfits --
Business, casual,
and even special occasions.
That would be a shoe
that would sell itself.
The jeska high-Heeled shoe
allows women to change
the look of their shoes
from a stiletto to a wedge
with a simple push,
slide, and snap.
By releasing the safety catch,
the heel can be slid off,
and another heel can be slid
in its place.
It's that easy.
Wow.
With hidden
magnetic components
and a built-In mechanism
for interchanging heels,
our product offers women
a canvas
they can continually update
and change.
And with your help,
we can bring this product
to the masses.
Cinderella's proof
that one pair of shoes
can change your life.
Great idea.
Thank you.
John: What kind of sales
do you have
on the Mr. Potato head
for stilettos?
[ laughs ]
that's very funny.
I do not have any sales
right now.
We're still
in the prototype phase.
May I see that shoe?
Yes, ma'am.
You're not the first
to actually design a shoe
with a detachable heel
for women.
You're right.
The first patent was filed
in 1899.
Why haven't I seen it
in shoe stores?
We have seen
other products
that allow women
to transform their shoes.
I think people just haven't
partnered with the right people
and made
the right connections
in order to get it out
to the market.
But, Jessica,
there's another thesis here,
and it goes like this.
Shoe companies have
no vested interest
in reducing
the number of pairs they sell
by making
the heels interchangeable.
That does not help them
sell more shoes.
That's why the shoe companies
have not embraced this idea.
Cuban: You have
all these other shoe companies
that are spending
millions and millions of dollars
to let women know
that they exist.
How are you gonna stand out
so that people can find you?
I think
the way that we stand out
is licensing this technology
to an existing brand.
It's a huge industry.
You're a tiny, little
shoe cockroach in it.
You're scurrying around
in the dark,
trying to get some exposure
for this.
To actually compete
with the giant shoe companies,
do you think
that's gonna be easy?
I don't think
it's gonna be easy.
I don't think anything anyone
ever does in business is easy,
but I do think
it's possible.
What are you gonna
sell these for?
Right now, it is estimated
to be sold at $200 retail.
Whoa.
Do you have a patent
on that?
It is patent pending, yes.
What's the patent on?
It is for the magnets
and the interchangeable-Heel
concept.
You're giving us prices,
and you haven't made any.
Forget even selling.
Mm-hmm.
How do you know
the prices on this shoe?
I'm currently working
with a manufacturer overseas.
Okay.
And we are
in pre-Production.
They're right now building
the equipment
that is necessary
to manufacture this product.
Do you have any of your own
money invested into this?
I do.
I have a lot of my own money.
How much is it?
How much?
$63,000.
Where did you get
the $63,000 from?
When I was a young girl,
my grandfather smoked cigars,
and I made an agreement
with him.
"grandpa,
if you stop smoking cigars,
I promise
I'm gonna do good in school."
[ chuckles ]
so, he believed me, and he
set aside a college fund for me,
and he said,
"Okay, for every craving I get
"or every amount
that I would spend on cigars,
"I'll put it
into a college account
for you to use
whenever you go to college."
Nice grandpa.
Yes.
And then,
when I went to college,
I had scholarships based
on the grades that I got,
so I never actually
touched the money.
Whenever I graduated
with my masters,
I called my grandpa,
and I said,
"grandpa,
I have this crazy idea.
I want
to start a shoe company."
[ chuckles ]
and he said,
"I'm an entrepreneur myself,
and I would love for you
to follow in my footsteps."
He said, "Jessica,
if you don't take a risk,
you never get the reward."
And so that's when I used
all of that money
to go towards the company.
Eventually, that ran out.
Starting a business
I never would have thought
was so expensive.
A couple months ago,
I was at a crossroads.
I needed more money,
but I couldn't get it.
And so I actually went
to the person
that could never tell me no --
My parents.
Oh, I know this story.
They took a second mortgage out
on their home.
Were you okay with that?
[ Voice breaking ]
it was very hard
to have my parents
take that risk.
It was one thing to risk
my financial savings.
But it was very hard to put
my family in that situation.
I also --
I work full time,
and I put every dollar
that I earn into this company.
My mother did the same
for me.
I knew
that you could relate to that.
I got turned down
by 27 banks.
Mm-hmm.
My mother
put up the house,
and I moved sewing machines
in the house.
I made a factory
in the middle of Hollis, queens.
No matter how hard things got
for me,
I could never
go to my parents
because I couldn't wake up
the next day
with that pressure
on my shoulders.
Well,
you're very fortunate
that you have parents
that love you that much.
Yes, I do very much.
Here's the part
that I'm struggling with.
Perhaps the reason
this isn't out there --
Maybe women like
changing shoes.
There's also another product
out there
that offers women the ability
to change their accessories
using a snap on the toe.
It's a ballet flat
that they do it on.
And this company had $16 million
in sales in 2009.
So, Jessica, why don't you
focus on the one attribute
to your deal
that you haven't addressed
and maybe the reason
you failed --
How are you going to
get distribution?
The plan is that --
I don't have all the answers.
That's the plan?
I'm not here telling you
that I have all the answers
because that would be
a lie.
Clearly,
you don't have a plan.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
[ sighs ]
Jessica, I'm gonna make it
a little bit easier.
I just don't know anything
about the business,
so partnering with me
isn't gonna help you.
I have no idea.
I mean, I stopped wearing
shoes like that a long time ago.
[ laughs ]
but I'm out.
Thank you.
I have a price question.
Okay.
So, you're gonna be selling this
shoe with one heel for $200.
If you want a second heel,
what's that consumer
gonna pay for it?
Anywhere
between $20 and $30.
Here's what I don't like
about your plan.
You're asking someone,
in the price point
of $200, $230 a pair of shoes,
to buy your product.
I think
those people are affluent enough
to just buy two pairs
for the same price.
Oh.
And I just might add --
My first business,
I lost $42,000.
It was worth $1 billion
to me then.
I failed miserably
after two years of trying,
and you know what?
I should have given up
after three months.
I had a bad idea.
But in giving up,
I got into the right business.
I'm sure
there's a right business
right out that door
for you,
and I admire you,
your enthusiasm.
Mm-Hmm.
But I just couldn't invest,
so I'm out.
Look, if attitude and drive
were the measures of success,
you're gonna be
very, very well-Off one day.
I just can't see the business
and how you get there,
but I definitely know you're
gonna make it in something.
Thank you very much.
That means a lot.
I'm out for the shoes.
I have a great idea.
I know I do.
The interchangeable-Product
market is making millions,
and I know this product
can do that, too.
Narrator:
Four sharks are out.
Daymond is Jessica's last chance
to make a deal.
I have a great idea.
I know I do.
The interchangeable-Product
market is making millions,
and I know this product
can do that, too.
I've been told, "no" --
Like you have -- So many times.
So, "no," today Does not mean
the end of the road for me.
You're very, very early,
don't have a patent,
don't have a finished sample,
don't have experience.
All you have is debt
and a lot of courage.
[ laughs ] thank you.
All right?
[ Sniffles ]
your parents believed in you.
My parents believed in me.
And I think I'm gonna take
a Gamble and believe in you.
Oh, thank god.
[ laughs ]
I'm gonna make an offer...
but it's gonna sting.
Okay.
[ sniffles ]
I will give you
$70,000...
...for 70% of the company.
Oh, god.
Oh, come on.
Daymond!
Uh...
I have to do this job
for her.
Daymond,
you're making her an employee.
Understand
what I'm offering you.
I'm going to work
basically for you at this point.
I'm gonna teach you
every single thing I know.
I will do the distribution,
the shipping, the billing,
all that stuff.
$1 billion in orders comes in,
I'm gonna get it financed.
Every "No" Gets you closer
to a "Yes."
You're not done,
and you've got a long way to go.
John: Absolutely.
I believe
that you're gonna go
and do this
with or without me,
but I just know the work
that I have to put in,
and I'm just really investing
in you at this point.
Jessica,
what do you want to do?
A small portion of a big thing
is a lot better
than a big portion
of a small thing.
So, I take your deal.
All right! There you go.
See that?
Wow.
I got a lot of work
cut out for me.
But I'm gonna be
willing to learn.
All right.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate
all of y'all's feedback.
I really do.
Thank you.
[ sighs ]
to have a partner like that with
that much industry knowledge,
all of the contacts that I could
never even dream of getting,
and the capital, it just --
It's everything that I wanted.
