First up are Neil Cameron,
Peter Ferreira,
and Dennis iannoti,
who are seeking an investment
for their pumped-Up nut butters.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Neil Cameron.
I'm Peter Ferreira.
I'm Dennis iannoti.
And we're...
ALL: Nuts 'n more.
We are seeking
$250,000
for a 20% equity stake
in our company.
Good ol' p.B.
Just got a face-Lift.
Nuts 'n more
are fortified butters
with added protein,
added omegas.
They're high in fiber
with no sugar added.
Nuts 'n more was born
this past year
in a small corner
of my family's bakery shop.
We ground lots of nuts,
mixed ingredients together,
and filled jars
by hand.
It wasn't long
before nuts 'n more
was ready for its big debut
on the shelves.
We were
instantly recognized
by Pro fitness athletes,
celebrities,
and more importantly,
nutritional stores were Buying
our products by the minute.
With your help,
we'll be able to take our nuts
to the next level,
where it belongs.
[ chuckles ]
So, sharks, are you ready
for some aggressive expansion?
Can we try it?
Absolutely.
You're gonna try it
right now.
Here you go.
We have four varieties
right now.
They're fortified
with protein and flax.
We have a peanut butter,
a chocolate peanut butter,
an Almond,
and a chocolate Almond.
Do people
like the taste?
Absolutely.
They love the taste.
The Almond butter is way better
than the peanut butter.
I love peanut butter.
Have it every morning.
So, why is it
better for me?
Because you have
double protein.
So you got 14 Grams
of protein
compared
to seven per serving.
We put flaxseed in it.
It's what gives you
the omegas -- 3, 6, 9s.
And you get
the added fiber.
So, just so we don't think
you're absolutely nuts...
[ laughter ]
...said you've only been open
a year.
Correct.
Actually,
a little less than that.
All right.
Sooner or later, we're gonna get
to this valuation of...
we'll get to it now,
I guess.
...$1.25 million...
what?
...for your company.
You've been open
a year.
Boy, let's hear it.
Cameron: Yep.
What are the sales?
So, we've actually started
selling about five months ago.
We've been open
a little less than a year.
To date,
we have $100,000 in sales.
Wow.
The valuation is
where it is
because we've been
approached
by the country's
largest national distributor.
Mm-hmm.
And they have got nine
warehouses across the country,
and if we were to put a pallet
in each warehouse,
that would be a little over
$1 million in revenue.
Okay.
Have they actually ordered?
They haven't ordered
because we can't fulfill.
What is it retailing for,
and what are you making it for?
So, the peanut retails
for $10.99.
Whoa.
And the Almond
is $12.99.
And how much
do you make it for?
We make the peanut for $2.90
and the Almond for $4.
With this investment,
we'll be able
to secure raw materials
at a much higher volume.
And bring it down.
It would bring the price
of our peanut butter down $1.50.
See if you can convince me
on the $1.3 million value.
O'Leary:
$1.250 million.
It's the brand.
The brand?
But who knows
this brand today?
Our name is starting
to become synonymous
with
the health nut butter --
CUBAN: Tell me
about the reorders.
Are you getting reorders?
We are getting --
Every single week.
Okay.
That's how many accounts?
32 retail outlets.
That's out of 35,000.
So, you got
32 retail outlets.
And we have online.
We have online.
We have online.
What percentage of your business
is online?
It's about 50%.
So, you're selling
about 70 units a month
from most stores,
and they're reordering, and
they're continuing to reorder?
Reorder
almost every week.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Dennis,
I'll give you this.
It is a great name.
You guys are big guys.
You work out, obviously.
Cameron: I'd love
to have Robert in, too, but --
It's too much.
It's too much.
Herjavec:
These guys are tough.
They're gonna
negotiate us up.
You start at 35%,
we're gonna end up at 25%.
Let's just see
what happens.
Here they come.
Cool it.
All right, guys.
What did youse guys decide?
We would love
to have both of you.
We think
50% is too much.
We've worked
unbelievably hard,
and we are going to continue
to work hard.
We'd really love
to get you down
maybe to 30%
with that tiered approach.
'cause we can prove to you
with that approach,
you're putting
a little skin in the game
to see
what the return will be
and to know that you've made
a solid, sound investment...
...and that you've got
three guys
who are working their tails off
to get that home.
Robert,
what's your feeling?
I'm not in at 30%.
I'll go down
to mark's 35%.
35%?
35%.
You guys got a deal.
All right.
Got it.
Good job.
All right, will I look like you
if I, uh...
absolutely.
All right,
man.
Good job.
Nice job.
Thank you, guys.
Thanks, guys.
Cameron: Thank you.
Have a good one.
Killed it.
Pete.
John: You know what I loved
about them?
They didn't get caught up
in the big number.
They really wanted
what they needed.
Yep.
Did you bozos just pay
a quarter million dollars
for peanut butter?
Yes.
[ laughter ]
