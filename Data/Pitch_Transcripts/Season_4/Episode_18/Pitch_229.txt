It's not, like, a guy like Kevin
selling your product.
Was that an insult?
Oh, no. Just fact.
Come on the squash court
with me. I'll kick your ass.
[ laughs ]
But I think
my challenge is this.
You're asking
for a value of the company
as though
you've already made it.
Right.
As though you've already got
all those big orders.
But we cannot commit
to these distributors
if we cannot deliver.
But that's what you need.
That's not
what the business is worth.
I mean, are you saying you need
the $250,000 in cash
to fulfill the orders,
no matter what?
Well, no.
That's to do
a few other things.
That's to staff.
That's to shore up a few of
our equipment in our facility,
to be able
to reduce our overall costs.
Right now,
we're at $2.90.
That jar
initially cost us $4.
Okay, so you're processing
and putting this all together
yourself?
Absolutely.
And you're packaging it
yourself?
Yep.
Iannoti: When we started
this brand,
we had fitness pros
come to us.
Now, these are bodybuilders.
These are bikini people.
Guys, listen. Listen.
I like you.
We're from the same tribe.
We're exactly the same.
What tribe is that,
daymond?
You know,
young, handsome, and built.
Very True.
You know it.
The issue here is,
your valuation's so crazy,
and you're working
on assumptions.
I'm a customer
but not an investor.
I'm out.
Your branding and packaging
is terrific.
That's your work?
I'm a graphic designer.
She never says that.
She never says that.
Thank you.
Everything's done
in-House.
I feel like I'm opening
expensive women's face cream.
This is a heartbreaker.
It really is.
Great packaging,
great name.
What a shame that you price this
at $250,000.
What a shame.
She's basically
calling you bozos.
We're here to negotiate, too,
just with you.
For me
to give you $250,000,
I would have to take
80% of the business.
I might be willing
to do it for 79%.
[ chuckles ]
let me ask you a question,
all right?
I just want
to finish up --
Let me ask you guys a simple --
I want to finish --
Barbara,
you're driving me crazy.
Excuse me.
I want
to finish one paragraph.
You're driving me crazy.
I just want to tell you
I'm so sad, but I'm out.
Now she's dead to you,
all right?
Let's move on.
That purchase order
from the distributor...
Yeah.
...there's a whole industry
of people
that give you cash
for purchase orders.
Why didn't you get
the purchase order?
It was, unfortunately,
due to fulfillment.
We need the capital to bring
the cost of the jar down
a little bit more.
What is the wholesale price
you're selling at?
Wholesale for peanut is $5.75,
and Almond is $7.25.
So, your margins
aren't big enough
'cause they don't have
the capital.
O'Leary: So, let me
take a stab at it.
No. No, I won't
give you $250,000 for 20%.
There is no chance in --
I can't even say
what I want to say.
Kevin. Kevin.
We -- Kevin.
We know
you love to wet your beak,
and we want you to be part
of the nuts 'n more team.
$250,000, I'd have to own
the whole business,
all your cars,
all your houses.
Or you can
adjust the equity.
Okay. I need 264%.
[ chuckles ]
I'm out.
Give me a total dollar amount
that you need to buy
in order to get your prices down
to where you want them to go.
About, um...$7,000.
$7,000?
Yep.
That's it?
That's just
for peanuts.
That's just the peanut.
What I'm trying
to figure out
is the least amount of cash
it'll take
to get you
to the highest margins.
Sure.
How much in aggregate
will you have to spend
to get to your optimal
cost of goods sold?
I think
mark's onto something.
Right.
If I spent $50,000,
I can fulfill that one order,
make a little bit of money,
and get my volume going.
Is that right?
Absolutely.
Mark, I think at $50,000,
they lower their price point,
and they can take orders.
I'm gonna propose something,
Robert.
Tell me
if you'd like to join me.
Yep, I'm listening.
I'm gonna propose something,
Robert.
Tell me
if you'd like to join me.
Yep, I'm listening.
We have $250,000 for 35%.
No, mark.
Hold on. Let me finish.
Let me finish.
Right?
But there's a contingency.
$75,000 in cash
up front
and then the balance
where and when you need it
to fund
future purchase orders.
So, I love that,
but I was gonna offer you
$250,000 for 50%.
I think there's a lot of value
in having two sharks.
And look, let's be honest.
You haven't
proven the business.
You've proven a concept.
You guys are nuts
if you don't take that.
Why don't you guys go think
about it?
Yeah, can we think
about it?
Yeah.
So we can
talk about it, too.
All right,
so what do you guys think?
I think
50% is way too much.
We're not
giving up 50%.
I actually like --
I like cuban's tiered.
I love it.
Because
we're gonna crush it.
You know
we're gonna crush it.
50% is gonna create
more problems than it solves,
simply because
there's 16% each,
and they're gonna
get resentful.
And this is the block party,
Kevin.
Thank you.
Daymond.
John: Thank you.
And these will look
wonderfully on you, mark.
Hey, sharks.
I'm Nick Gonzales.
And I'm Kevin Mack
here with neo innovations,
and we're currently seeking
$80,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in our company.
There are
over 150,000 new Tattoos
being put on by Amateur
tattoo artists every month,
and half of those are gonna
suffer from tattoo regret.
That terrible feeling you get
after a tattoo
that you thought
was a good idea at the time
but ended up
to be the worst.
Well, finally,
there's an affordable method
of tattoo removal.
Black magic ipl is
an intense-Pulse light device
that uses light energy
to break up the dark pigments
in tattoo inks.
It breaks them up
without breaking
the surface of the skin.
Black magic ipl provides
affordable tattoo removal
for less
than one laser treatment.
It's so easy...
BOTH:
Anyone can do it.
Here's how it works.
Place the tip of the device on
the area that you want to treat
and pulse
one to three times,
moving forward
one-Quarter inch at a time.
The tattoo will then fade
in quarter-Inch spots
a few weeks
after treatment.
Herjavec: Do you have
any example of your skin
that where you did remove
a tattoo,
what it looked like?
Can I show you?
Yeah.
Okay.
So, this is
just one treatment.
Come on.
Yep.
So, you're saying
Those white Holes
are just
from one treatment?
One treatment.
Mack: Sharks,
here I have two balloons.
This balloon
is gonna represent
tattoo-Ink cells
underneath the skin,
while this balloon's
gonna represent
the skin on top
or around the tattoo.
As you can see,
when I pulse
or even hold on this balloon,
it is not affected
by the light
because there is
no dark pigments
to collect
the light energy.
But when I pulse on the balloon
with dark pigments...
it pops instantly.
So, sharks,
who wants to jump on board
with neo innovations...
BOTH:
And help us light the way?
[ laughter ]
I got a question.
Mm-hmm.
I'm black. Will I explode
if I put that on me?
[ laughter ]
Very good question.
There's
a scaled-Down version
where you can put
the slider control way down.
3 Watt
on up to 50 Watts,
so you could, you know,
treat depending on
the darkness of your tattoo
and what type of ink
is on your body.
You're expecting
the average person to understand
what wattage
they should Dial in
and then start
zapping their skin?
No, but it's very --
think there's any chance
people are gonna fry themselves?
No.
Wait.
This is for home use?
Home use. Yes.
Herjavec:
Oh, I didn't get that.
I thought
this had to be regulated
by somebody
who's licensed to treat you.
Our device
is nonablative,
which means that it does not
Pierce the layers of skin.
Laser treatment
doesn't Pierce the skin.
It pierces
through the top layer of skin.
But is this safe?
Yes.
It is safe. Yes.
O'Leary:
So, you send it home.
"honey,
the tattoo remover's arrived."
Minutes later,
the ambulance pulls up.
No.
Absolutely not.
How did you get there?
What's your background?
Gonzales:
I owned a tattoo shop.
Had more customers coming in
for tattoo cover-Ups
and asking
about tattoo removal.
What about the science?
Intense-Pulse light
has been around
and fda-Approved
since the '60s, so...
forever. Yeah.
O'Leary: Is it a diode
that provides the light?
No.
It's just a 50-Watt bulb.
50-Watt bulb?
50 Watts. Yeah.
That's it?
That's it. 50 Watt.
So, educate me.
You said This light
has been around forever.
Does anybody else use it
for this purpose?
Nope.
Not with
the neodymium ring magnet.
Most tattoo inks
are very magnetic
because of
the iron oxide content.
Not many people
know that.
So, you just dreamt it up
one day --
"I'm gonna shoot this guy
with a light bulb,
and his tattoo's
gonna go away"?
"I'm gonna put the laser
business out of business."
Exactly.
It's evidence-Based.
Light treatments are
the most effective way
to remove a tattoo.
So, is there
any home-Based competition?
There's a couple of other
home tattoo-Removal systems,
but they're
thousands of dollars.
Is that bulb hot
to the touch?
There is a little bit
of discomfort.
What are your sales?
Current sales --
Right now,
we keep them
at about one to two a day,
so that's about 30 to 40
a month.
How do those 30 people find you
every month?
Right now,
just amazon and ebay.
Yep.
How long
have you been doing this?
We've been doing it
for about a year and a half.
How much have you sold
in the last year?
700 units
the first year,
and we're --
about 1,200 units total.
1,200 units. How much
do the units retail for?
$139.99.
We've sold them
up to $300.
You believe you're gonna do
$200,000 in sales This year?
Most definitely.
The more we market,
the more we sell.
2% to 3% convergence rate,
whether it be on amazon,
ebay, or the website.
How easy is it to use?
It's pretty much
point and shoot.
You're saying
it's so easy,
I can just use it on myself,
and it won't hurt me?
No. Absolutely not.
No.
How many times
do I have to do it on myself
to get rid
of a tattoo like that?
If I did this whole tattoo
all at once,
it would be
90% to 100% removed.
You're saying
in one treatment,
I can get rid
of 90% of that tattoo?
My immune system's
fairly healthy.
I work out.
I drink a lot of water.
I don't drink alcohol.
I don't smoke.
So it's gonna be really quick
for people that are healthy.
Corcoran: Sorry, guys.
I'm just having
a very hard time
with the safety aspect
of this.
Is it fda approved?
Both:
The process is fda approved.
You've taken and applied
for an fda approval
for the process
and submitted your device?
And that's
where we're at now.
The fda approval firms
that we talked to
said it can cost
between $20,000 and $100,000,
and that's primarily what
we would use that money for.
And you're allowed to sell them
before the approval?
Yeah.
They said, "you're fine."
I'm having a hard time
believing this. Sorry.
I'm out.
Huge market.
Billions of dollars.
Absolutely. Yeah.
Huge demand.
It's not just
the tattoo removal.
You know,
it's the pigment disorders.
Guys,
I actually love the idea,
but I get sued for the craziest,
craziest stuff ever.
I'm just a target.
And so I just can't
take that risk.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Well, if I can counter that,
this is not something new.
This has been around
for decades.
No, I get that.
I get that, right?
But that doesn't make me
any less of a target.
You know, Kevin, the reason
you're not gonna get sued today
is you're two tattoo guys.
The minute I come in,
they say,
"ah, there's a shark involved.
Forget those two guys.
Let's Sue him."
So, being able
to get a device -- Any device --
Combustion engine, anything
that deals with electricity,
they're all dangerous
to buy.
So, there's ways
to get it protected
and make it where it's safe.
I don't disagree with you.
I can't get involved.
I'm out.
We do have
liability release forms
at the point of purchase.
All it takes
is one idiot to Sue you.
You don't have to have
a legitimate reason.
So, mark's out,
Barbara's out, I'm out.
Daymond, Kevin?
Well, I actually like
the business,
because I think
that's what you're building
is a business
for removing tattoos.
The numbers are great.
Liability is the issue.
It only takes one lawsuit,
which is such a headache.
And I can't
get around that.
I'm out.
You're coming
without the fda approval.
You know,
a kid gets ahold of this thing
and burns
his little brother's eye out.
And there's an easy fix
with that.
There's
just a little key switch,
on and off,
where the key --
You know,
there's protective functions
to be able
to stop all that.
I'm out.
Corcoran:
So, the lesson there
is stay poor,
and you won't get sued.
Cuban: You won't get sued.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you, sharks.
John: Thank you.
Good luck.
Mack:
This is a major industry,
and to just look over something
just because of litigation,
you know, it's...
[ scoffs ]
speechless.
[ both chuckle ]
