Hi, sharks.
My name is romy taormina,
Thank you, romy.
Barbara,
this is the color play.
Thank you.
Romy, is there any proof
that this actually works?
It's an fda-Cleared
medical device.
That's not an answer
to the question.
No, no.
That's not what I'm asking.
What I'm asking is,
is there any medical proof
that this actually works?
Yes, there are clinical studies
that have been conducted
to effectively show
that they relieve nausea.
Why?
It's a nei guan
acupressure point,
which is located
2.5 finger Widths
above your wrist crease
between the wrist tendons.
Acupressure has been practiced
for more than 5,000 years.
So, romy, you've been
selling these for how long?
We launched in 2007.
Romy, you've sold $1 million
of these in the last 12 months?
Yes.
How?
We are selling nationally
as well as internationally.
We're selling in more than 6,000
u.S. Retail locations.
What did you make
on the $1 million?
We had 11% net profit.
Why is the profit so low?
It's not low.
Corcoran: Romy.
Yes.
Obviously,
your passion...
is phenomenal.
Thank you, Barbara.
No one can doubt that.
Thank you.
Hey, romy.
Here's where I stand.
I have no problem
with the pursuit of profit.
John: Well, romy. Hmm.
I don't know if you're selling
Snake oil or not.
I actually tend to believe
in these things
Taormina: No.
Why not?
I just believe
I'm gonna take this company
so much further than that.
