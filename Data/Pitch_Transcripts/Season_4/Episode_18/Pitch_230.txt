Hi, sharks.
My name is romy taormina,
and I am nausea-Relief chief
and co-Founder
of psi health solutions,
the maker of psi bands.
I am seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my business.
Psi bands are the stylish way
to quell the queasies.
They are mom-Invented,
patented,
and fda-Cleared
acupressure wrist bands
for the relief of nausea,
like for the pregnant woman
who suffers
from MORNING sickness
or the traveler who has saved
all year for a Cruise
and doesn't want to suffer
from MOTION sickness
or the CANCER patient
who is facing their next round
of chemotherapy.
I suffered from DEBILITATING
morning sickness
during both of my pregnancies
and wore acupressure wrist bands
to relieve my nausea.
But I was frustrated
with the existing products
on the market that were dated.
They stretched out over time,
and I couldn't wear them
in the shower,
or else
They'd get waterlogged.
So I created something both
fashionable and functional.
Psi bands are
uniquely waterproof,
available
in several fun colors,
and adjustable around
the circumference of the wrist,
as well as
at the acupressure point
for personalized comfort
and fit.
The adjustable orb
creates pressure
on the acupressure point
to relieve nausea.
I invite you
to invest in a company
that is already profitable.
Now I'd like
to pass out some samples.
Robert,
this is the Cherry Blossom.
Thank you, romy.
Barbara,
this is the color play.
Thank you.
Romy, is there any proof
that this actually works?
It's an fda-Cleared
medical device.
That's not an answer
to the question.
No, no.
That's not what I'm asking.
What I'm asking is,
is there any medical proof
that this actually works?
Yes, there are clinical studies
that have been conducted
to effectively show
that they relieve nausea.
Why?
It's a nei guan
acupressure point,
which is located
2.5 finger Widths
above your wrist crease
between the wrist tendons.
Acupressure has been practiced
for more than 5,000 years.
It's non-Invasive,
it's affordable, and it works.
So, romy, you've been
selling these for how long?
We launched in 2007.
And what are your sales
for the last 12 months?
Almost $1 million.
Whoa.
Romy, you've sold $1 million
of these in the last 12 months?
Yes.
How?
We are selling nationally
as well as internationally.
We're selling in more than 6,000
u.S. Retail locations.
What did you make
on the $1 million?
We had 11% net profit.
Why is the profit so low?
It's not low.
You're selling $1 million,
and you're only making $110,000.
Do you take a salary
out of that?
We do.
It's $100,000.
That adds another 10%.
Walk me
through the numbers.
What does it cost you
to make this?
They retail for $15,
and we have
a 60% gross profit margin.
So, in $1 million,
your gross margin is $600,000.
Yes.
And you're clearing
$110,000.
Add your salary back.
That's $200,000.
What happened
to the other $400,000?
It goes to overhead.
It goes to bookkeeping,
rent, utilities.
Do you have any debt
in the company?
We do have debt. Yes.
How much debt do you have?
We have $600,000
in debt.
Ah.
Which includes
past deferred salaries
that we didn't take
for the first four years.
Okay,
but how much of that --
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you saying
that because you didn't
pay yourself in the past,
you consider that debt today?
Yes, I do.
Seriously?
Corcoran: Romy.
Yes.
Obviously,
your passion...
is phenomenal.
Thank you, Barbara.
No one can doubt that.
Thank you.
And the idea that you
carried forward a salary
that you thought
you should've gotten
based on the work
you already put in.
Right.
But do you know how hard
that would be for an investor
to watch you write yourself
a check
for work that happened
two years ago
against the money
that was given
to the business
by the investor?
They would hate you.
Okay.
So, are you in or are you out,
Barbara?
I'm definitely out.
Okay.
Thank you, Barbara.
What percentage of people
does this not work on?
Acupressure, there's
an individualized response,
so I can't tell you how many
it does or does not work for.
You're my biggest critics.
I'm already receiving
the cynicism,
but I can vouch
for the fact
that we have $1 million
in sales.
There's a lot of things
that sell that don't work.
But, mark, why do you
have a problem with it?
You're basically
resolving a problem
that is crushing people around
the world on an ongoing basis,
yet you really don't have
any r&amp;d,
and you don't have
any Ongoing r&amp;d.
You understand why I'm very,
very skeptical of this product.
We would not be able to make
the medical claims that we do
if it weren't
for our fda clearance.
No, but you're avoiding
the actual claims.
You're saying
it helps with.
Placebos help with.
It relieves --
'cause I cannot make the claim
that This is gonna help
100% of the people
100% of the time.
I can only tell you that
acupressure relieves nausea.
I understand you believe,
but that doesn't make it real.
I'm out.
Okay.
Hey, romy.
Here's where I stand.
I have no problem
with the pursuit of profit.
You can stand up there,
and you can try
to sell me whatever you want.
And I don't have any problem
with that...
until you tell me
it helps people with cancer.
I understand.
It's a very emotional thing.
Every bit of my being cringes
when you say that.
I'm out.
Okay.
O'Leary: Daymond?
John: Well, romy. Hmm.
I don't know if you're selling
Snake oil or not.
I actually tend to believe
in these things
because I do a lot of fishing,
and I get nauseous.
I mean, huge, right?
Right. Yes. Yes.
So, I was
believing in you,
but you said to me
when you came out
the company is profitable,
number one.
It's not profitable
if it has debt
and it's not paying down
the debt.
It's not the black.
I just don't think
I trust you.
That's the bigger problem.
I'm a very, very trustworthy
person, daymond.
You might be,
but today, your presentation
made me a little woozy.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I will do you a favor
because I think
your business has revenue.
I think it's growing.
Let me make you an offer,
okay?
I'm going to
give you $250,000
for 40% of your company,
all right?
Basically, about six times
your cash flow.
That's what it's worth.
Please say yes.
Taormina: No.
Why not?
I just believe
I'm gonna take this company
so much further than that.
I really stand firm
on the 10% for the $250,000.
I feel like it's very,
very reasonable and fair.
Do you want some time
to consider that offer?
No. Thank you, though,
for the offer.
Do you want
to counter it?
I have a small amount
of flexibility.
We're very far off.
No investor will ever
give you that.
Never.
Okay.
They'll go through
the same analysis I just did
and say you're very greedy,
and you're way overvalued.
I'm not giving away
40% of my company.
You're dead to me.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
They are sharks.
They will bite your head off.
When they don't believe in
something, they just go for it.
And I stand behind my product
and what it's doing for those
who suffer from nausea.
Narrator: Next up are
Nick Gonzales and Kevin Mack
with a new solution to
an otherwise permanent problem.
