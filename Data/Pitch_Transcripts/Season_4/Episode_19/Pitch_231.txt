Hi, sharks.
My name is Byron Young.
My company is cordaroys.
I'm here seeking
a $200,000 investment
for 20% of my company.
Sharks, I'm here today to
show you the cordaroys beanbag
Byron, what happened there?
I believe that
when the product sells
as many as we're gonna sell,
it's all gonna be worth it.
He believes in me.
I want the product
to succeed
All right.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations, Byron.
Thanks.
Wow.
This man went through this
