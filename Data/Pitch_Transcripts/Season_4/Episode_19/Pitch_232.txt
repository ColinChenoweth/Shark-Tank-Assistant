My name's Ryan Ehmann,
and I'm from Loveland, Colorado.
(girl) What's this one?
I live out here with my wife
and my 2-year-old son
and my 3 1/2-year-old daughter.
Whoo!
(laughs)
For 14 years,
I was a professional rodeo rider
on the pro rodeo circuit.
Ten years ago, I got injured
really bad at a rodeo.
I went to over 15 doctors,
and they said
I'd never ride again.
I was so determined to get
my health back and life back,
I got certified as a trainer
and healed my body.
Yeah! Two!
(class) whoo!
I've developed
a revolutionary workout program
that's better than
anything on the market.
(Ryan) We're galloping
the horse!
I just had this burning desire
that I needed to take
this unique workout
and help millions of other
people get their lives back.
Rodeo abs! Here we go!
I've taken my workout system
as far as you can
on a local level.
I need an investment
from the sharks
because I need an infomercial,
to where I can bring my passion
straight into people's homes,
bringin' the good old
cowboy energy,
and get you what you want,
which is results.
Whoo-Hoo! That's what
I'm talkin' about!
My name's Ryan "Cowboy" Ehmann,
and my company's called
lose 12 inches
with any 12 workouts.
I'm seeking
a $120,000 investment
for a 25% stake
in my life-changing company.
Sharks, everybody said I was
crazy to come into the tank.
Let me show you crazy.
Check this out.
Yep! That's me.
I was a rodeo rider
on the pro rodeo circuit.
I then started having
chronic lower back pain.
I went to over 15 doctors.
They said I'd never ride again
or never do anything physical,
and I'd have to live
with a "bad back."
I was so determined
to heal my back
and prove those doctors wrong,
I went and got certified
as a personal trainer
to learn about my body.
And that's when
I developed this system
that makes any workout
more efficient,
and it'll maximize
your result.
So I put it to the test,
and in three months' time,
I shredded my body
down to 4.3% body fat.
I healed
chronic lower back pain.
And then I developed...
Rodeo abs! Whoo-Hoo!
(laughter)
I then returned to rodeo
to win a national championship
in Dallas, Texas.
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about! Whoo!
(laughter)
Now let me show you
some of my clients
that got amazing results.
Here's Ray.
At 52 years old...
Kevin!
(laughter)
At 52 years old, he started
working out for the first time.
I taught him my system,
and in ten months' time,
this is what he did
with only three workouts a week.
Look at that.
Nice.
Now here's Shawn
he used to do 2-hour
extreme gym workouts.
He then got my system,
cut his workout time
literally in half,
and this is what Shawn did.
(laughter)
Look at that.
Wow.
So, sharks,
with your investment today,
I can get my lose 12 inches
with any 12 workouts
in the hands of the millions
of people who need it.
Whoo-Hoo!
That's what I'm talkin' about!
(laughter)
Who's ready
to ride with me?
You gotta tell us
more about it.
Yes, absolutely.
Thank you for asking.
What it is, is it's
a software program
that I developed.
You put in
your personal information,
and this calculates
your heart rate training zone
where you need to work out
during any workout.
And you wear
a heart rate monitor watch.
If your heart rate
gets too high,
you're gonna use muscles
for energy,
and you're gonna be
losing muscle,
and you'll never,
ever, ever
tap into your body fat.
It's all about
working out efficient.
So this simple program--
It's a trade secret.
And this is a dvd
that just educates people,
teaches them about
the heart rate training.
Why it's so important,
and what it does to your body.
Ryan...
so I work out all the time.
You need the system.
It's not working.
Because if I wasn't
in the gym every day,
I'd look like Mr. O'Leary.
(laughs)
But I don't look like you.
They don't look real.
Yeah.
I mean, your abs,
I've never seen--
Thank you.
It's like
the incredible hulk.
Well, and here's
what's really crazy--
in March,
I'll be 41 years old.
I'm literally
in the shape of my life,
and I've never worked out
so smart and efficient.
So what do I do?
It's so simple.
What you're gonna do,
Robert--
You're gonna put
this watch on.
A heart rate monitor?
Heart rate monitor watch.
The secret is, is me teaching
you how to use the watch.
When I buy
my heart rate monitor,
they tell me I gotta get
my heart rate above 140.
But it doesn't give you
a precise scientific program
that tells you
your exact zones.
So is it tailored
towards me?
Yes. It's all about the zone.
(Lori)
if I'm understanding right,
it's not like
you put in a disc,
and then you've got
an exercise routine to follow.
No. This--
This all has to do
with the heart rate
and whatever
you've figured out?
Absolutely.
You'll go do
your hour of elliptical,
and whatever--Whatever workout
that you may do,
and you're just gonna
stay in your zone.
(Robert)
Tell me your plan.
Yes. Step one would be
internet--
for $9.95,
they could download this.
They're gonna instantly learn
how the system works.
Step two that I see--
Get me on tv.
Get me in front
of the viewer.
You're talking
infomercial here.
Absolutely.
Infomercial...
he's the thighmaster cowboy.
Tv sales...
Yee-Haw!
Yeah, I mean,
you've got the personality.
Thank you.
It's great.
But there's one thing you've
gotta be really careful about
on tv,
and that is false claim.
It says right there--
"Lose 12 inches
with any 12 workouts."
Whether or not
the system works or not
is something that really
has to be validated, proven.
You have to have
an independent lab that shows
that you really actually lose
weight by doing this system.
(Kevin) None of this
makes any money.
I think what cowboy Ryan's
saying is,
"look, I'm a guy that you put
into an infomercial.
"I can go crazy
bouncing off the ceiling.
It's fun to watch."
I agree.
But what am I selling them
afterwards?
How do I make money.
Well, cowboy Ryan,
there's the challenge.
Yes.
That brings up
my next point.
This is phase one--
Teach people
the heart-Rate training--
Work out smart.
Phase two is my complete
Motivational dvd system.
And I have a lot more products
that--that I've developed.
So I patented a machine,
I used it,
developed my abs,
healed my back.
I licensed it to a company
earlier this year.
So are you ready?
Check this out right here.
And you'll never guess
the name of it.
Rodeo abs!
Yeah! Right there.
That's the machine
I developed.
The reason it is so unique
and so proficient
is because my patented
rolling wheel technology--
What this does--
You just sit on it,
you just put your feet on it,
and you just pull your feet
up and down just like that.
What are the handles for?
Oh, great question.
Those are the reins for when
you're riding your horse--
Hyah, hyah. Just kidding.
(laughter)
I had ya.
It's a full-body machine,
'Kay?
Arm curls, upper back,
lats.
Everything's different now.
Now you're startin' to want
to ride with me, aren't ya?
Can I sit on it and try it?
Yeah, absolutely.
I just wanna see.
And by working
your hamstrings,
you know what
it does, ladies? Watch...
(Wolf-Whistles)
(laughs)
(laughs)
Now if you have tennis shoes on,
you'd pull up and down,
and you'd also
put pressure downward.
Do you feel it, Lori?
I do feel it.
I can't believe you waited
so long to show us this.
Did you make any money
off it?
Uh, yeah.
Sold in Australia
and Germany.
Did it sell well?
It did a little over
a million dollars.
Whoa.
You remind me of an artist
that needs a producer.
That's what I think
the analogy is.
Hmm.
That's a good analogy.
You have a tremendous amount
of energy.
But I don't see
the potential for me
to give you $120,000
and make it back.
But somewhere out there
is the right person for you.
But it's not me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
(Robert) Mark?
Ryan, I gotta tell you,
I'm guessing
you're a great trainer
because you've got
the personality for it.
But sometimes,
when the volume goes up
so high,
my skepticism meter
goes up so high.
I can't figure out
what you are.
And when
I can't figure it out...
that's--That's
a huge problem for me.
I... I'm just not buying it
right now, Ryan.
I-I'm sure
you made a great rider.
But on the business
side of things,
I'm just not there,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
I-I can tell you, though,
this right here--
This is my blood,
sweat, and tears.
Hey, Ryan, did we ever explain
the 12 inches in 12 workouts?
No, sir, I didn't.
It's--It's all over
your body.
So I do a measurement
of your neck, shoulders, chest,
three measurements
on your abs,
your hips and your legs.
Oh, I see.
So I'm not losing
12 inches off my waist?
N--Particularly, no.
I've had a lot of clients
that definitely have.
But in ten years,
training 10,000 people,
I've never had one person
not lose the minimum
of 12 inches.
In how long a time?
12 workouts.
No way.
Yeah.
No way.
Yeah. Absolutely.
Ryan, I-I think your energy
is incredibly infectious.
All right?
Um, I am gonna challenge you
on the 12 inches in 12 workouts.
Oh, I'd love it.
I'd love it.
Maybe you're the next
cowboy Ryan infomercial king.
I don't know. But the business
you presented today,
I-I can't get there.
This right here,
and you're asking--
No, I-I hear you,
but, you know, I-I think
you've had a fair shot.
Sure.
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to be out.
Thank you.
Sometimes the best cowboy
for the job is a cowgirl.
I love that saying, Lori.
I think potentially,
there's something great here.
Are you gonna be
his producer or not?
So...
Daymond and Lori
are Ryan's last shot at a deal.
Sometimes, the best cowboy
for the job is a cowgirl.
I love
that saying, Lori.
I think potentially,
there's something great here.
So...
are you gonna be
his producer or not?
Well, that's the problem.
I don't know that it would
be right to be your producer,
because I'm not sure
what we'd be selling people
would be the right thing.
And I always wanna give people
a quality product
that they're not gonna
be disappointed in.
Absolutely.
And this has got
a lot of claims.
Absolutely.
So for that reason...
No.
Hold on. Just wait.
(Lori chuckles)
Before
you throw the cowboy,
all I ask, and every person
that I've ever come across,
is you just
give me one chance.
A chance to be able
to change millions of lives.
I may be a little clouded,
but I'm gonna have to
just believe in my heart
and say
there is something here.
Just give me one chance.
You'll never forget the time
you invested in the cowboy.
Well, here's the thing--
You need to be able to prove
that this really works.
I'm not going
to invest today.
What if--what if I give you
more percentage of the company?
I'm here.
I want to negotiate.
I'm--I'm telling you,
I... I'm your guy.
I'm so sorry,
but I just see
too many challenges here.
And for that reason,
I can't be your cowgirl.
I'm out.
I-I do like it.
I-I think I like you more.
I think you're the--
You're the brand.
Ryan, I-I'm gonna give you
the $120,000 for 25%.
Really?
I'm gonna believe
in you. Yeah.
We're gonna ride together.
All right.
Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!
Let's go.
We're gonna ride together.
That's what I'm talkin' about!
I-I fell in love
with you, man.
Oh, my god! Aah!
I fell in love
with you, man.
Thank you.
All right.
I will make you proud.
All right.
I know you will.
I know you will.
Thank you so much.
I know you will.
Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!
Are you gonna look like that
in a year, Daymond?
I'm still trying to lose
my holiday weight.
Holiday '07, but...
(laughter)
(Kevin) Daymond,
why don't you explain
exactly what happened there?
You know, when he sat there
and told Lori
that no matter what,
he would bust his butt...
So you--your investment
was purely cowboy Ryan?
That's it?
Yes.
The guy is great.
