Hi, sharks.
My name is Byron Young.
My company is cordaroys.
I'm here seeking
a $200,000 investment
for 20% of my company.
Sharks, I'm here today to
show you the cordaroys beanbag
and demonstrate why
it is the most comfortable
and versatile chair
in the world.
Now first of all,
it's like sitting on a cloud.
There are absolutely
no pressure points,
'cause it cradles you
with super-soft foam
that's guaranteed
to never go flat.
But that's
just the beginning.
Check this out.
(unzips)
With cordaroys...
there's a bed inside.
(Lori) Ah.
Cool.
Sharks, I need your help
getting this amazing product
into every household,
apartment, and dorm...
(laughs)
in the U.S. and beyond.
My product is ready,
my company's ready,
and I'm ready.
Let's do this.
Can we feel it?
Absolutely.
I'm afraid if we sit in it,
we won't come out.
That's what everybody says.
You won't wanna get out,
but I'll get you out.
Just fall back
like you wanna make a dent.
What do you think?
It's nice.
Nice, huh?
Yeah.
Hop in the bed, Lori.
It's really... (laughs)
This one converts
to a king-size bed.
This is a full-size.
What's inside? Polyfill?
It's the same thing
that's in a sofa cushion,
except for it's shredded.
So it'll never go flat.
All the parts are replaceable.
The covers are washable.
Was it comfortable, Lori?
It--It's really
comfortable. It is.
So you're saying for $200,000,
I get 20% of your business.
Absolutely.
That means you're telling me
it's worth a million dollars.
Absolutely.
You know?
Or sales are so lucrative
that you're making at least
$200,000 of profit This year.
Both.
Oh.
Oh.
We have a utility patent
on the idea.
The concept of the bed
coming out of the chair
is a utility patent.
Granted?
Not just a patent,
but we've enforced it twice
against companies much larger
than us, successfully.
Really?
Absolutely.
Good for you.
I like that story.
Absolutely.
Now let's talk
about the cash.
The cash.
Um, well, last year,
we only did $1.4 million
in sales.
Not bad.
(Robert) Wow.
And I say
"only $1.4 million"
Because my business
is designed
to be
a $5 million business.
I've got everything in place
from manufacturing,
products, personnel.
Um, we have a-a store
at the mall of America,
which has been in business
for almost eight years.
A store--Meaning
your retail store?
Our retail store,
selling only our products.
Okay.
All right. What was your net
from last year?
What was the profit?
The net was the problem,
because we're at
our critical mass.
And when I say
we did $1.4 million,
we only netted about
$100,000 last year.
That's fine. But have you sold
to any retailers?
We're in mostly
privately owned places now.
We have done qvc.
How did it do?
We did about $2,400
a minute,
and that was five days
prior to Christmas.
Is that good, Lori?
No.
It's not--I don't think
it is very good.
But you were five days
prior to Christmas,
which is a very hard time.
What year was that?
That's been
about ten years ago,
or eight years ago.
Oh.
So you've been
doing this forever.
(Lori) So that's, like,
a whole nother story.
I've been doing it
for a while.
How long you been doing it?
Uh, seriously
since about 2001.
You've been doing this now
for 11 years?
Yes.
(Kevin) seriously.
And you've done
about $1.4 million in sales.
Yes.
In--in the last year.
We've done up to--
Almost $3 million.
A year?
Yes.
And what is your cost
on that?
Uh, the--the queen,
for instance,
is sort of
our medium size.
We make it
for about 70 bucks,
and it sells for $259.
Yeah. Got it.
And we get--We have
40% margins on wholesale...
Yeah?
And 80% on retail.
Furniture in this country
is sold in some
pretty big furniture outlets.
And why aren't they
carrying them?
Because it takes a salesperson
to sell the product.
Oh, come on.
It's a beanbag.
I know, but you do need
to do the demonstration.
How much investment
have you made into it?
Well, I've got, uh,
$300,000 in inventory
right now
that's paid for in full.
I've got a $100,000
piece of machinery
that's specially designed by us
to manufacture this product--
Which, by the way,
is a very key part of this,
because we can manufacture
these very quickly.
Tell me what you did
in your web sales
in just the last year.
A little over
$700,000 last year.
Our customer is not technically
a beanbag customer.
You know, for instance,
our mall of America location,
they're all impulse buys.
Those people did not come
to the mall to buy a beanbag.
So what will you use
the money for?
I will use the money
mainly for marketing.
And frankly, I'm here
to find a strategic partner
who has already
done this with a product.
That becomes
a challenge for me,
because I just don't know
if I-I can give you
assistance in that area.
Mm-hmm.
If it was manufacturing
and production,
that'd be a different case,
but I think
you have that buttoned up.
Right.
Uh, so, I'm out.
Okay. All good.
I like what you're doing.
I think it's interesting.
But there's two issues--
One, it's very dependent
on you to go sell...
Mm-hmm.
Right?
And the other part is,
it's--It's geared
towards impulse buys.
Okay.
And neither one of those
really benefits
from more spending.
And you wanna spend
the money on marketing.
And so I don't see that
necessarily as--As a great fit.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Hate to see it, Mark.
Hate to see it.
For $200,000 I get 20%?
You're telling me
it's a million dollars.
I don't think so.
I think your company's
worth about four or five times
what you made This year,
which is about 500 grand.
You're not worth
a million bucks.
Yes, I am. The company's worth
more than a million dollars.
Well, we can disagree...
well...
but it's my money.
So I think you came in
With too high a price.
I could adjust it
and go for 50%,
but I don't think
I'm gonna do it.
I'm out.
Okay.
So how many we have left?
Just two?
Come on. This is
a great deal here.
Somebody better
jump on it. Come on.
All right. Let me tell you
where--where I'm at.
I-I mean I think it's obvious
you--You--You need somebody
like a Lori for this thing.
Um, but I wanna be involved.
I'll give you $200,000 for 40%.
But I'll put up the $100,000
if you can convince Lori to
come in for the other $100,000.
What do you think, Lori?
Talk to me.
(laughs)
(laughs)
Come on.
Women love this product.
I don't want a partner
on this.
You know, aero beds are
a multi-billion-dollar business.
Mm-hmm. Right.
And they don't have a chair.
So there's a need.
It might do good on qvc.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not sure
about the price point.
So I'm gonna give you
a tough offer.
Okay.
But I'm gonna say first
that an opportunity like
what I'm going to give you
is going to come
once in a lifetime...
Mm-hmm.
And it's going to come fast.
Okay.
And if you blink,
it may go away.
Fast like a train
right over your head.
Ooh! Let's hear
your bloodsucking offer.
You know
this isn't gonna be good.
So...
I will give you
the $200,000...
Okay.
But I want 60%
of the company.
Wow!
Whoa.
Ooh.
Byron, what happened there?
I believe that
when the product sells
as many as we're gonna sell,
it's all gonna be worth it.
He believes in me.
I want the product
to succeed
and become a household name.
That's my goal.
If that happens,
everything else will work out.
Well, hopefully, your new boss
will help you do that.
(laughs)
(Mark) That's right.
Promise me?
Yes.
(Daymond) Yep. Congratulations.
I promise you
I will do my very best.
All right.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations, Byron.
Thanks.
Wow.
This man went through this
11 years,
and he gave it up
that easy.
It's fabulous.
This is a winner.
He's gonna be like,
"Lori, it's your company.
I quit. Send me my check."
You guys wanna come up
with an excuse
for why he did that.
I just wanted
to sit in a beanbag
that was once worth a million
and is now worth $400,000.
(Lori chuckles)
I really came here
to get a deal.
I was not leaving without a deal
if at all possible.
I would rather make, uh,
a little less money
and have--Work with
someone like Lori
than to not get the deal.
