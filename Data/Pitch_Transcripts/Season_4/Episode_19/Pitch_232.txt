(Ryan) We're galloping
the horse!
I just had this burning desire
that I needed to take
this unique workout
I think what cowboy Ryan's
saying is,
"look, I'm a guy that you put
into an infomercial.
"I can go crazy
bouncing off the ceiling.
It's fun to watch."
I agree.
But what am I selling them
afterwards?
How do I make money.
Well, cowboy Ryan,
there's the challenge.
Yes.
That brings up
my next point.
This is phase one--
Teach people
the heart-Rate training--
Work out smart.
Phase two is my complete
Motivational dvd system.
(Robert) Mark?
Ryan, I gotta tell you,
I'm guessing
you're a great trainer
because you've got
the personality for it.
But sometimes,
when the volume goes up
so high,
my skepticism meter
goes up so high.
I can't figure out
what you are.
I... I'm just not buying it
right now, Ryan.
I-I'm sure
you made a great rider.
But on the business
side of things,
I'm just not there,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
I-I can tell you, though,
this right here--
Hey, Ryan, did we ever explain
the 12 inches in 12 workouts?
No, sir, I didn't.
It's--It's all over
your body.
So I do a measurement
of your neck, shoulders, chest,
three measurements
on your abs,
Ryan, I-I think your energy
is incredibly infectious.
All right?
Um, I am gonna challenge you
on the 12 inches in 12 workouts.
Oh, I'd love it.
I'd love it.
Maybe you're the next
cowboy Ryan infomercial king.
I don't know. But the business
you presented today,
I-I can't get there.
Ryan, I-I'm gonna give you
the $120,000 for 25%.
Really?
I'm gonna believe
in you. Yeah.
We're gonna ride together.
All right.
Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!
Let's go.
We're gonna ride together.
That's what I'm talkin' about!
I-I fell in love
with you, man.
Oh, my god! Aah!
I fell in love
with you, man.
Thank you.
All right.
I will make you proud.
All right.
I know you will.
I know you will.
Thank you so much.
I know you will.
Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!
Are you gonna look like that
in a year, Daymond?
I'm still trying to lose
my holiday weight.
Holiday '07, but...
(laughter)
(Kevin) Daymond,
why don't you explain
exactly what happened there?
So you--your investment
was purely cowboy Ryan?
That's it?
Yes.
The guy is great.
