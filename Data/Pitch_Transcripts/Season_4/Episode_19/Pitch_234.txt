First up are
Heather Murphy-Monteith
and Andy Hurwitz,
with the next hot thing
in dance clubs.
Hello.
I am Heather Murphy-Monteith.
And my name
is Andy Hurwitz.
We are here today to offer you
10% equity in our company
in exchange for $150,000.
We tour across the country
in a custom-fitted disco van,
throwing incredible parties
where the dance floors
are packed
and the music
is always bumping.
I'm sure you've been
to some amazing parties before,
but ours have the most love,
the most fun,
and the most energy,
mostly because of
our fabulous clientele.
(dance music playing)
(Lori laughs)
(Robert) aw!
Oh!
(Robert) Whoo!
(laughs)
(rhythmically)
Go, Griffin. Go, Griffin.
(Heather) Oh, yeah!
Let's go, Buddy!
Raise the roof!
Come on, guys.
So, Heather, these aren't
birthday parties that I'm...
no.
So you go, and it's an event,
and you advertise it
like anybody would anything.
It's a big event.
You're party promoters
for kids, basically?
That's right.
We have our club events,
which are
at real nightclubs.
And it's the biggest party
in town.
We triple-clean the venue
from top to bottom,
making sure
it's completely child-proof.
Then we set up
our signature activity zones.
We have hula-hoop heaven,
we have
a family photo booth,
we have
a chill-out zone,
and we top it all off with
a full spread of healthy snacks,
unlimited juice boxes
for the kids,
and for the parents,
a cash bar
as long as
they're not driving.
How many people
are in attendance?
We average around 350.
That's pretty consistent.
350, and that's been
consistent throughout?
Yes.
Right, so--
(Robert) So how do I
find out about you?
When we started
seven years ago,
we spent zero dollars
on traditional advertising.
It's the power of moms.
Not only do we have
word-of-mouth
through social media,
we have hundreds of moms
across the country
that love to come on board
on our team and work with us.
How much money have you made
in the seven years?
We have grossed
$2,800,000 in 7 years...
Whoa.
With $2 million of that
being in the last 5.
Wow.
What about
the last 12 months,
and what about
the last one month?
This year is going to be
a $525,000 year.
Let me just set up
the big picture for a second--
we spent the first two years
building the brand,
spending more money
than we could make
to get it from east coast
to west coast.
We plant as an institution
in each of these cities.
I go, I fly out,
I hire a mom, I train a mom,
I train a crew.
At our biggest
U.S. domestic spread
of 33 cities,
we made $800,000,
but we were under by $20,000.
So you sold $800,000,
but you lost $20,000?
Yes.
This year, you think
you're gonna sell $500,000?
What we haven't spoken to
is our amazing sponsorship.
We have $425,000 alone
this year in sponsorship.
Wait, Wait, wait, wait.
So $425,000 of
your $525,000 in revenue
is from a sponsor?
We have to walk a fine line
between sales and sponsorship,
because we--our sponsors
are sponsoring us
to play for free.
Why would I ever do
a free event?
Kevin, hang on.
I'm still confused
what the business
has evolved to today.
While this was
all happening,
we were approached
by major publishers.
Penguin books said,
"can you put out some books--"
you're dancing
around the question.
Give me one advantage--
Let me be clear on this--
the answer is,
at baby loves disco,
we make money
from sponsorship,
we make money
from ticket sales,
and we make money
from merchandise.
Give me an event,
just one Saturday afternoon.
How much money do I make?
We make
between $1,500 and $3,000
on each individual event.
How much will
the sales be next year?
Next year, we're projecting
to make $750,000.
What amount will come
from the shows,
from sponsorship,
from the merchandise?
Well, merchandise
is a question mark,
but we project sponsorship
to be in the same league.
We don't see why not.
So you think you can
find other sponsors
that wanna market to moms?
It's easy. I mean,
you can imagine,
it's not that difficult
to find other partners.
I gotta tell you,
when I hear you saying "easily--
I can get a sponsor
for $300,000 easily"...
right.
It really undermines
your credibility with me,
because if it was that easy,
you'd have multiple sponsors.
There's more risk
in doing sponsorship deals...
yes.
Than selling ticket sales.
No, you guys--You guys
are missing the point.
The thing is, we were
doing this before sponsorship,
and we'll continue doing it
without.
(Kevin) I don't think
I'm missing anything.
Heather, how many parties can
you throw that sell tickets,
that allow you
to generate revenue?
That's how you can control
your own destiny, right?
Well, since we've been
through that experience,
and since we worked for three
years without sponsorship...
When you said you had
a network of moms everywhere
that you were working with,
that's enormous value.
When you started to tell me
about all these kids
you brought into these events
all the time,
I could see value in that.
When you started polluting it
with all the other stuff,
that ruined it.
I'm out.
But we've sunk into creative,
and we've built the brand,
and it's doing great.
But, Heather, Heather,
the challenge
that we're having here...
Yes?
Nobody said
you did a bad job,
nobody said
you didn't dedicate yourself.
We just don't understand
what's happening going forward.
I'm absolutely lost.
I'm out.
Honestly, we are
making this up as we go.
We have created
this brand--
No kidding.
You are making it up
as you go.
(laughs)
Think of it this way--
I'm just a simple investor
trying to scratch out
a living, okay?
Right.
He's right when he says
he's simple.
And I don't understand how
I could ever
make any money with you.
I don't understand
what you're doing.
I simply wanna go to bed
richer than I woke up.
That'll never happen
with you guys.
I am out.
I like what you're doing.
I like the premise of it.
Kids being happy and dancing
at good, healthy,
fun parties is great.
But I have to say,
I'm concerned
that the business model
isn't there,
and I'm--I just don't think
that I would make back
my money fast enough.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Look, you--You built something
that nobody else could do.
You built a business with moms
to do shows to attract kids.
You grew the market,
and you stopped doing that.
In what way
did we stop doing it, though?
Our numbers of attendees
have increased.
We threw a 5,000-Person party
in central Park last year.
Look, I...
Andy, I-I gotta tell you,
I-I'm not buying
into the business plan. I'm out.
Good luck, guys.
Appreciate it.
Thank you, though.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
(Lori) Good luck.
Ready, boss?
It's not
a horrible business.
You know what, though?
They're not salespeople.
But they just confused
the whole thing
by trying to tell us
they had so much going on.
What are we talking
about this for?
What's the point?
(laughs) Yeah. Right. Right.
It's over. We never
have to listen to that again.
Heather is a survivor.
I'm a survivor.
We are excited
to move forward.
And, you know,
it's a humbling experience.
Sometimes it feels good
to get your butt kicked
on national tv.
For her Candy company
painted pretzel.
Let's see
what she's up to now.
(whispers) Yes!
