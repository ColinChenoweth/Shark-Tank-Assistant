are Mike Kane
and David Artuso,
offering a new kind
of protection
for a device
most people can't live without.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Mike Kane...
and I'm David Artuso.
We're from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
and we're the co-founders
of the cellhelmet brand.
And we're seeking
a $160,000 investment
for 20% equity in our company.
Cellhelmet
is the world's first
and only
brand of accessories
to include a safety net
of accidental damage coverage
for your mobile device.
You see, the biggest problem
with the mobile
protection industry
is you're forced
into ridiculous accessories
and ridiculous
monthly insurance premiums.
But when your device
does break,
you're either out of luck
because your case manufacturer
won't do a thing,
or you're pounded
with a hefty deductible.
(laughs)
First...
Let's take a look
at this bulky smartphone case.
This company goes as far
as telling me
that this case
can withstand abuse
from a boat anchor.
(clatter)
All aboard!
All right.
Ow!
Now Let's take a look
at these screen protectors.
This company goes as far
as telling me
that these are
"Military grade,"
and that they can withstand
abuse from rotary tools.
They better be,
or we just spent 20 bucks
on some plastic film.
(drills)
All right, guys,
as you can see...
(laughter)
Neither device
has survived.
You're facing
two issues now.
Number one--Your accessories
manufacturer is gonna say
you're crap out of luck,
'cause they could care less
that your device is damaged,
even though they told you
it probably would survive.
Number two--
Your insurance deductible
is gonna cost you
upwards of $200,
depending on your device
and your provider,
which doesn't sound fair
to me at all.
So now in comparison...
no!
Let's take a look
at the cellhelmet brand.
Are we saying
that our cellhelmet cases
can withstand all kinds
of crazy abuse?
Whoa.
Absolutely...
not.
(laughter)
If a cellhelmet case does fail
to protect your device,
we're gonna repair it
or replace it for 50 bucks.
Are we magicians?
Not at all.
We just happen to be
the only company on earth
who's bundling
our protective accessories
with a safety net
of accidental damage coverage.
With our hard work
and the help of the sharks,
we can lock down our own
massive niche in this market.
Team up with us today,
and let's change the way
people protect
their mobile devices.
Who's ready to join us?
(laughs)
So what you're offering here
is--is an insurance policy,
or a case, or both?
Basically what you're doing is--
Basically what we're doing
is pre-Buying your repair
in the instance that you should
have an accidental damage.
You buy the case
for $44.99,
and you register the case
within 30 days of purchasing it.
At that point, you now have
one year of a safety net.
If your phone accidentally
breaks inside of our case,
you're gonna call
our 24/7 hotline,
and it's gonna be repaired
or replaced
within three business days.
So you don't give me
another phone?
If we are unable
to repair the device,
we will replace
the device.
So walk me through the model--
How long you've been around?
We've been manufacturing
the cellhelmet case
for four months now.
And have you sold any?
We have sold 1,300 units
directly to the end consumer.
Oh, my goodness.
You guys are nothing burgers
in this space.
The guys who control this
do hundreds of millions of
dollars in distribution.
They just started
four months ago.
We've done about
$60,000 in revenue.
And what's it cost you
to repair?
Our average repair
for a smartpho--
Or for any device is $77.
But you're paying
for all that yourselves?
Yes. Uh, basically,
the way it works is--
Oh, I hate
your business model so much.
I have to punish you.
I just don't know how.
It's a profitable venture.
So do you know
what the attrition rate is?
Do you have any idea yet?
Yeah. Right now,
over the past four months,
we're averaging about 3%.
3% repair rate.
And the average is--
It costs you $77 a hit?
So let me
explain something to you--
That--We have that $45
when you purchase
that case up front.
There is a $50 repair fee,
so we're always
gonna be profitable.
Compare that to--
Sorry. So I buy the case,
I pay you $44.
Yeah.
But then if it breaks,
I call you up, and you say,
"give me 50 bucks."
(Lori) Yes.
There's--there's
a $50 handling fee.
So it's like a deductible?
That's a good way
of associating it.
Let me ask you this.
Let's say you have to
replace the phone.
Do you make any money
at that point?
Now you're out
$200, $300 bucks.
It's very hard to get
to the point of replacement.
Uh...
so if I broke my phone
using someone else's case,
then I went out and bought
your case for $44.95
thinking, "aha, I'm gonna pull
a quickie on these guys..."
there are people out there
that take advantage
of the system.
It's gonna happen
for eternity.
Uh, but basically,
the way our model works,
our average take is above
our average payout.
It's very fitting
that you wore those helmets.
Have you ever heard
of a viking funeral?
Uh, no, I...
they load up
a boat with wood.
(laughter)
They put the dead bodies
on the top.
They set it on fire and they
push it out into the ocean.
That's you guys.
This is a horrible idea.
I'm out
with extreme prejudice.
I wanna set you on fire
and float you out of the tank.
(laughter)
We appreciate your time.
Mike--Look, if you're
in the case business...
yes.
I'm not a big fan
of the cases.
Okay.
I think--So I don't think
you're in that business.
I think you're in
the "person who's afraid their
phone's gonna break" business.
So if that's
the business you're in,
I-I don't see the growth there.
If my phone breaks,
I just wanna walk in,
here you go,
give me a new one.
Um, I don't buy
into the strategy.
I'm out.
Yeah. Thank you
very much for your time.
Okay. Thank you.
I agree with Robert.
It's like you're in the, uh,
cell phone hospital business,
and I think it needs to be
cell phone emergency room
business,
which really
wouldn't be fast enough.
For that reason,
I'm out.
This, to me,
is really an insurance deal.
And I'm sorry there's so many
unethical people out there.
I think they're gonna
take advantage of it.
I'm out.
And four sharks are out.
There's only one left.
We got one left.
Guys, I get your business.
Definitely.
You guys are in
the arbitrage business--
You're in a business
of collecting money
and just hoping
to pay out less.
You're taking advantage
of the inefficiencies
of a market.
Yep.
Yes.
That sounds good,
but what happens
in that type of market
is that other people
with more money
figure it out very quickly.
So they'll see what type
of conversions you'll do,
and they'll say,
"if I only charge $25,
"and I triple what they're
spending in online marketing,
I can do the same thing."
This truly is a scenario
where big money can come in
and play the financial
aspect of this game,
because there are
no barriers to entry.
The number one thing
we do like about that idea
is when the big company
comes in
and does what we're doing,
that validates
what we're doing.
Bull crap.
Are you in or out, mark?
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Sorry, guys.
Okay, sven and thor...
(laughter)
It's time for you
to get on the boat.
And it's with heavy heart
that I set it afire
and float it out of the tank.
Thank you, guys.
Appreciate your time.
Thanks, mark.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Good luck.
Later.
I've always
wanted to break stuff.
Oh. (laughs)
(laughs)
I've gotta
send it in for repair.
(laughs)
I think that putting us
on the boat
and burning us right away
didn't really give us
an opportunity
to get everything out
that we needed to.
