Oh, that is absolute crap.
Mike. Mike.
No, that is so True.
Mike. Oh, come on.
You've got a great plan.
You gotta execute.
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
All we want to know is,
hey, will chicks dig it?
It's sink...
This is not morality tank.
Or swim.
We've sold $2 million.
Wow!
Whoa!
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary is
a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran
went from working
as a waitress in manhattan
to building the city's
preeminent real estate empire.
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert
Who grew
his homegrown clothing line
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.
Robert Herjavec,
the son of
an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first
internet companies
for over $350 million.
And Mark Cuban, notorious
billionaire entrepreneur
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.
First into the shark tank are
Sarah Ponn and Mike Hartwick,
who believe they're on the cusp
of the next big fitness craze.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Mike Hartwick...
and I'm Sarah Ponn...
and we're here to present
our company surfset fitness.
We are seeking $150,000
for 10% equity in our company.
Surfset fitness is surf-inspired
exercise equipment
and group fitness classes.
This is the ripsurferx.
It's the world's
first total body surf trainer.
We've designed it to mimic
the instability
of a surfboard on water.
And we have here with us
Lakey Peterson.
She's one of the top ten
female surfers in the world
and she's here to show you
a few of her moves.
So Lakey's gonna walk through
the pop-up.
This is one of our moves
in surfset.
It's extremely challenging.
It's an athletic move.
She's gonna use her arms,
her core,
balance, stability.
You can see she's rocking
side to side...
cool.
All about the imbalance.
Now she's gonna show you
how a surfer
would dive under a wave.
This is called a duck dive.
You can see she's engaging
her triceps, her chest,
really working the arms,
the core.
And we're gonna finish with
what we call a water Walker.
So it's similar
to a one-Legged squat.
You can see that she's trembling
a little bit.
She's engaging every muscle
in her core, her legs.
So we're here today, sharks,
because we have
more interest and orders
than we can handle
and we need your help.
That looks like it's very hard
for the average person to do
any of those exercises.
That's quite complex. It's very
difficult to stay stabilized.
Let's take an average bozo
like Robert.
Absolutely.
Absolutely. Come on up.
The only thing I ask is
your shoes off.
Get the full experience,
if you can.
She made it look pretty easy.
It didn't look that hard,
I gotta be honest.
So she's had some experience.
So we get up one foot at a time.
All right, I'll step on.
There you go.
And then bend the knees.
Get into your carve and your
surfing motion. Look at him.
Whoa! Nicely done!
(Mark) Easy, rob.
Whoo!
What was the really hard move?
Was--was the one foot?
The one foot.
(Mark) The one leg.
(Daymond) Single foot.
You go one leg
and then you just go like that,
as if you're, like, stroking
through the water with your...
ooh. That's a little Harder.
Whoa.
(Sarah) like skateboarding,
kind of.
(Mike) So, yeah, you gotta find
that middle.
(Lakey) It's a little, uh,
it's a little shaky on that one.
(Mark) Good night, Robert.
(Robert) That was good. Thanks.
How do you change
the--the levels?
You can change it
really quickly.
Change it on the fly. So...
So you want to make this hard?
Snap these off.
And it goes just like that.
That makes it harder.
You can take all three off.
And are those on both sides?
(Robert) It's
an interesting offer, Mike.
I see the business
a little bit differently.
I think you don't need
the professional surfer guys.
I think they're great,
but I think that can be
intimidating to a lot of people.
The trainers need to be bubbly,
energetic.
I'll give you the $150,000--
'cause I don't think you should
give up that much equity.
It's gonna go big--for 20%.
So a lower valuation is
basically what you're saying.
I'm saying keep more equity.
Nobody starts a company
out of their basement
and works their butt off
to give up one-Third of it
at this stage.
Don't gamble your future
until you know what you have.
A lower valuation
for less money.
Funny. Every time
I say something,
I hear somebody else talking.
Sarah, Mike,
what are you gonna do?
and Sarah and Mike have
three offers on the table.
Keep an eye on one thing here
as these offers come in,
because it matters.
You started with $1.5 million
as for the value
of what you created here.
Mark knocked you down 33%
to $900,000.
These two very greedy sharks
have knocked you down to half
of what you asked for.
But also manufacturing is--
is a plus. That's--That's--
factoring. He's--
It's just factoring, Mike.
You're gonna have
the money anyway.
(Daymond) It's not just
factoring. It's not at all.
I know that--
Oh, that is absolute crap.
Mike--
No, that is so true.
Mike. Oh, come on.
(Robert) Mike, I started
a company nine years ago...
(Barbara) So True.
3 guys. We're 160 people today
and $100 million in sales.
We did $52 million last quarter.
This is what this is.
You've got a great plan.
You gotta execute.
I rolled about six crossfit gyms
in the last four months
as well
as a big training program.
And if you know anything
about crossfit,
it's very hard
to get certified.
Yes, but he's a short man...
(laughs)
And that doesn't figure image
at all.
(mark laughs) Wow, Barbara.
So, Mark, are you in
or are you out with Barbara?
Sorry, Barbara.
I don't need you on this one.
I'm going alone.
Okay. In that case, I'm out.
Do you want more money
than $150,000 today?
I think that we could--
that we could benefit
from more money right now.
If we had more,
we could do it faster.
If you have
a manufacturing pipeline,
you don't need more money.
When a business is
on the fast track,
one of the biggest challenges
they have
is to keep up
with success,
because they don't have
enough cash available to them
to meet demand,
and then somebody else steps in
to meet that demand.
And the quicker you get
to the point you need
to preempt those competitors,
the more successful
you're going to be.
Let me throw in here
for a second,
because I'm listening
to all this
and I'm saying to myself,
you're either gonna execute
and make this huge, 'cause I
believe you have that potential,
and brand is a big part of it.
The real lasting value
is not just that device.
It's the brand
you're gonna create.
The number one guy to build
a brand here is this guy.
So I want to tack on
to his deal.
I'll bring you in
on the deal.
Yeah, I'd like to do that.
Because they have to.
Yeah.
And This is where my
24-Second shot clock comes in,
'cause I need a decision.
$300,000 in cash
for a third,
full partner.
Should you need more
because business just explodes,
there's more money there.
I don't think you need
to give up
one-third of your business
today.
I think that would be foolish
and I don't think
you guys are foolish.
That's way too much.
So, Mike, I'm giving you
$150,000 for 20%.
Barbara's out.
Daymond and Kevin are
$150,000 for 25%
and they're giving you...
(Daymond) Manufacturing.
(speaks indistinctly)
Manufacturing.
Mark Cuban is in at $300,000,
but he's stealing one-Third
of your company today.
(whispers) Sarah,
what's your preference?
Go with your feeling.
(normal voice) I mean,
manufacturing and brand
is very important for us
right now.
Sarah, Mike,
what are you gonna do?
Counter 30%.
Huh? Is there any way
to come down on any of that?
You talking to me?
Yeah.
A little bit.
A little bit on the, uh,
ownership?
I'll come down to 30%
if you say "Yes" right now.
No, don't do it.
A designer alone is gonna
cost you $150,000.
Push, Sarah. You know
the right thing to do here.
Mark, we're gonna accept
your offer.
That's what I'm talking about!
(Barbara) Yes! Yes!
Ah! Horrible deal.
(Barbara) Great deal.
(Kevin) Horrible!
Thank you. Congratulations.
We're gonna make a lot of money.
We're gonna make
a lot of money.
You just made yourself
millionaires.
Absolutely.
Yes!
Oh, my god. (laughs
and speaks indistinctly)
You know, mark,
you stole their souls.
That's what you did.
You guys are
so full of crap.
You're a thief.
(speaks indistinctly)
(speaks indistinctly)
So excited. There were
so many offers coming out.
I'm--I'm confident
we made the right decision
and looking forward
to getting started.
We're so excited.
It's exactly what we wanted.
