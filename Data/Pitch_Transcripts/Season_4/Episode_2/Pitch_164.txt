Oh, that is absolute crap.
Mike. Mike.
No, that is so True.
Mike. Oh, come on.
You've got a great plan.
You gotta execute.
But first the entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
All we want to know is,
hey, will chicks dig it?
It's sink...
This is not morality tank.
Or swim.
We've sold $2 million.
Wow!
Whoa!
Who are the sharks?
Hi, sharks.
I'm Mike Hartwick...
ooh. That's a little Harder.
Whoa.
(Sarah) like skateboarding,
kind of.
(Mike) So, yeah, you gotta find
that middle.
(Lakey) It's a little, uh,
it's a little shaky on that one.
(Mark) Good night, Robert.
(Robert) That was good. Thanks.
How do you change
the--the levels?
You can change it
really quickly.
Change it on the fly. So...
So you want to make this hard?
Snap these off.
(Robert) It's
an interesting offer, Mike.
I see the business
a little bit differently.
I think you don't need
the professional surfer guys.
I think they're great,
but I think that can be
intimidating to a lot of people.
The trainers need to be bubbly,
energetic.
I'll give you the $150,000--
'cause I don't think you should
give up that much equity.
It's gonna go big--for 20%.
So a lower valuation is
basically what you're saying.
I'm saying keep more equity.
Nobody starts a company
out of their basement
Sarah, Mike,
what are you gonna do?
factoring. He's--
It's just factoring, Mike.
You're gonna have
the money anyway.
(Daymond) It's not just
factoring. It's not at all.
I know that--
Oh, that is absolute crap.
Mike--
No, that is so true.
Mike. Oh, come on.
(Robert) Mike, I started
a company nine years ago...
(Barbara) So True.
3 guys. We're 160 people today
So, Mike, I'm giving you
$150,000 for 20%.
Barbara's out.
(whispers) Sarah,
what's your preference?
Go with your feeling.
Sarah, Mike,
what are you gonna do?
Counter 30%.
Huh? Is there any way
to come down on any of that?
You talking to me?
Yeah.
A little bit.
A little bit on the, uh,
ownership?
I'll come down to 30%
if you say "Yes" right now.
No, don't do it.
A designer alone is gonna
cost you $150,000.
Push, Sarah. You know
the right thing to do here.
Mark, we're gonna accept
your offer.
That's what I'm talking about!
(Barbara) Yes! Yes!
Ah! Horrible deal.
(Barbara) Great deal.
(Kevin) Horrible!
Thank you. Congratulations.
We're gonna make a lot of money.
We're gonna make
a lot of money.
You just made yourself
millionaires.
Absolutely.
Yes!
