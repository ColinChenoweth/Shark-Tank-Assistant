Hello. I'm Aaron Marino,
owner of Alpha M Consulting,
Aaron, can we see
the other guy again?
Can we compare the two?
Yeah. Come on out.
Tell me, if I buy the dvd,
walk me through
how the dvd works.
The foundation of the style
system is the inventory list.
There are 59 essential items.
Aaron, could you make anybody
better-Looking?
Anybody.
Can you make Kevin
better-looking?
You tell us what you would do
with this guy.
I think I'm very well-dressed
right now.
Aaron, would you recommend
a hairpiece?
Sorry, Aaron. Let's go back.
How can you get to $61,000
in sales for the quarter
when you've only sold 75 cds?
I also--
I sell inter--Services.
50% of my sales are local,
domestic.
So included in your estimate
of sales...
Mm-hmm.
Is you consulting with people,
right?
Yeah. I may be shipping dvds,
but what I sell is confidence.
Aaron.
(speaks indistinctly)
I've been called
a bloodhound up here
'cause I get
to the bottom of things.
Mm-hmm.
So are you looking for us
to give you more than money,
but give you access, help?
I need help.
I need help with technology.
I need help with
international distribution.
(Aaron) That's okay.
You win some, you lose some.
I'm still helping guys.
