Hello. I'm Aaron Marino,
owner of Alpha M Consulting,
and I'm here today seeking
a $50,000 investment
for 10% equity stake
in my company.
As men, we're motivated
by two things--Money
and sex--And my company
helps them get more of both.
Whoa.
There were zero resources
out there
for everyday average guys
to get solid, basic advice
on how to look great.
Now sure, there are a handful
of men's fashion magazines,
but this is not reality
for 95% of us dudes out there.
We don't care
what the latest brand
of overpriced designer jeans
are.
All we want to know is
hey, will chicks dig it?
(sharks laugh)
Nobody ever teaches
or encourages us to look good,
and when we do,
we're mocked and ridiculed,
called names
like "metrosexual."
To those people, I say,
"sit back and watch.
"watch as my clients pass you
on the corporate ladder
and get the number of the woman
who just rejected you."
(laughs)
I have developed
a 6-Disc dvd series
that helps a man analyze
and build
the perfect basic wardrobe.
Meet Joe.
(Robert) What a slob.
Joe is average,
but by using
the alpha m style system,
Joe can build
the perfect basic wardrobe,
with a simple-to-follow
fashion formula.
Joe's got a hot date.
He follows the formula,
and Joe transforms
from average Joe...
(chimes tinkle)
(Robert) whoa!
To an alpha male.
I'll take this Joe.
(Robert) Are they twins?
Aaron, can we see
the other guy again?
Can we compare the two?
Yeah. Come on out.
Tell me, if I buy the dvd,
walk me through
how the dvd works.
The foundation of the style
system is the inventory list.
There are 59 essential items.
Each item has a specific number
and letter code.
Each outfit has a formula
that correlates directly
to the inventory list.
Right here.
This will explain it.
Oh, I love your
"a.1 + b.2 + e.1 + g.1" outfit.
That's very simple, by the way.
(Mark and Robert laugh)
Basically, that equation--
You get action.
(Barbara and Robert laugh)
All right,
and what city are you in?
I'm in Atlanta,
but I'm--I'm worldwide.
(laughs)
I'm a regular guy.
Aaron, could you make anybody
better-Looking?
Anybody.
Can you make Kevin
better-looking?
You tell us what you would do
with this guy.
I think I'm very well-dressed
right now.
(Barbara) And be quite honest
with this.
Yeah, he would put a feed bag
on him.
Other than the jacket being
a little bit too tight,
it's not gonna be too much.
No,
I'm 3 pounds overweight.
Aaron, would you recommend
a hairpiece?
No. Oh, no. That's one thing--
the brand.
Don't touch the brand.
No. No. No. No. No.
One thing I would do...
just asking.
I'd probably bring the sideburns
down a little bit,
slightly angle them
to follow the jaw,
and that's just gonna give
a little dimension to his face.
I'd love that.
Eyebrows look good.
Everything looks great. His
shoes are beautifully polished.
I might just give this guy
10 grand for the heck of it.
You're great.
Sorry, Aaron. Let's go back.
How can you get to $61,000
in sales for the quarter
when you've only sold 75 cds?
I also--
I sell inter--Services.
50% of my sales are local,
domestic.
So included in your estimate
of sales...
Mm-hmm.
Is you consulting with people,
right?
Yeah. I may be shipping dvds,
but what I sell is confidence.
Aaron.
(speaks indistinctly)
I've been called
a bloodhound up here
'cause I get
to the bottom of things.
Mm-hmm.
So are you looking for us
to give you more than money,
but give you access, help?
I need help.
I need help with technology.
I need help with
international distribution.
And how much help would you like
me to put in on a weekly basis?
(Robert) Full-time job, Daymond.
The real truth is you want us
to work for you.
Um...
yes or no?
As a partner. Partner, yes.
I'm out.
Okay.
I think you have
an interesting business,
and I believe
that you found a niche,
evidenced by the fact you're
taking in over $100,000.
It's not a bad business.
I'm not sure how leverageable
it is.
You are the whole brand,
so, I mean, a scenario that
I would be worried about is,
one day you step out
into the street,
and some guy wearing sandals
and white Socks,
driving a bus, runs you over.
(Daymond laughs)
Kevin, I see my death
as an opportunity.
You put "Style guardian Angel"
on there before...
(sharks laugh)
Hey, I put a white suit on,
some fluffy clouds,
maybe a Harp,
and I'm like,
"yo, alpha's checked out
"to the big wardrobe
in the sky.
I'm still here to be
your style guardian Angel."
I love it.
What's really important,
what we learned today,
is I'm the best-dressed shark,
and I thank you for that.
Oh, I don't think so.
But even with that on the table,
I don't think
it's an investable business.
I'm out.
I think where you're off track
here is the dvd set,
because I can't imagine
you selling that at--
What was your price again?
$297.
It's a ridiculous price.
I think you're going down
the wrong path here.
I'm out.
What--
I'm sorry to cut you off.
What's the price
of a compliment?
I mean, what is the price
of getting a number of a woman?
He's good.
You know what? He is good.
I think
you're a great consultant,
But the dvd--
I just don't see that working.
I don't think the slob guy is
gonna buy a dvd
and on his own, look like that.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
If I were to do this deal,
and someone said to you,
"who's your investor?"
it's Mark Cuban,
and I'm looking like that?
'cause I actually think that's
a better look than that look.
Really?
(Robert laughs)
There's no way you're gonna get
me wearing a tight sweater
and folded-over and a tie.
(Aaron) That's okay.
You win some, you lose some.
I'm still helping guys.
