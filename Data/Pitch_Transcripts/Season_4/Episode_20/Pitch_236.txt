My name is Lani Lazzari,
I'm 18 years old,
I'm from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
Hi, everyone.
Hey, Lani.
I was born to be
an entrepreneur.
I wanted to go over these
sales numbers with you.
When I was in third grade,
I started selling
hair scrunchies
out of my backpack
Hi. My name is Lani Lazzari.
I'm from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
What are your sales, Lani?
Our sales year-to-date
are $55,000.
What do you think you'll do
this calendar year?
This calendar year,
we're projecting
very conservatively
$100,000.
What do you think
you'll make on it?
Our profit margins
are 75% to 80%.
But you're not paying yourself
anything yet?
Sometimes I take
a small salary--
Um, $400 a month--When we
have the cash flow for it.
Couple gummi bears, Yeah.
Yeah. (laughs)
(Robert) Lani,
I'm more interested
than the money right now--
How did you come up
with the formulas?
Like, uh, like the chemistry
behind it?
I was more aware
of skin care products
than the average 11-year-old,
'cause I was always
at the dermatologist's office
with all of these problems.
Lani, I love you.
I think you are amazing.
Amazing.
The quality's great.
It smells great.
I'm so impressed by you.
Thank you.
But...
Lani, I love you.
I think you are amazing.
Amazing.
Thank you.
(Kevin) Okay, Lani.
Here's what I know
is a reality.
The cosmetics industry,
of which you're a part of,
is the most competitive
on earth. Why?
Because the only products that
have higher margins are illegal.
(chuckles) Yes.
(Lori chuckles)
It's virtually impossible
to get share
from the large companies
that own this space.
There's absolutely
nothing proprietary
of what you're doing
at all.
It's so simple to do that
even an 11-year-Old can do it,
Lani, I think if the measure
of success in a business
Mark is Lani's last chance
for an investment.
I'm not an expert
in this market, obviously.
Yes.
All I know is the suffering
my kids go through.
Yes.
So I want you
to explain to me
for my 3-year-old son--
He's got it all right here
where his eczema is.
Mm-hmm.
What should he do?
What product should he be using?
Eczema is a scaly,
dry skin condition.
So gentle exfoliation
is really important
to helping alleviate it.
So the scrubs,
with the blend of the sugar
Great.
Thank you so much.
Thanks. Congratulations,
Lani.
Thank you.
(Lori) Congratulations.
(Mark) Nice job.
Thank you.
You're amazing.
She was one of the best pitchers
we've had here
at any age.
She was 18.
