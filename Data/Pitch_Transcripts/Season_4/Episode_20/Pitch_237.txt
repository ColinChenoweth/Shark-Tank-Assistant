My name is Lani Lazzari,
I'm 18 years old,
I'm from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
and I'm the C.E.O.
and president
of simple sugars.
Hi, everyone.
Hey, Lani.
I was born to be
an entrepreneur.
I wanted to go over these
sales numbers with you.
When I was in third grade,
I started selling
hair scrunchies
out of my backpack
to my friends at school,
and that was just the beginning.
A few years later
when I was 11,
I started simple sugars.
Simple sugars products provide
a high-end
skin care experience,
while also being
completely all natural
and safe for even
the most sensitive skin.
Tie the bow on,
trim it up,
and give it to me, and I'll
pack 'em into the box.
Ever since the beginning,
I've always been the one
really running this business.
I have gone
to all my own meetings,
negotiated all my own deals,
even from the time
when I was 11.
I know. Oh, Kate!
(laughter)
My family is so important to me,
especially my mom.
Sports is not your thing.
(laughs)
Yeah, I know.
She drove me to every meeting
until I could get
my driver's license,
and she's been behind me
supporting me all the way.
I need an investment
from the sharks because
Simple Sugars has grown
as much as it can
with how we've been able
to fund it.
We've been bootstrapping
this business on credit cards,
and now we really need
to put a little bit of money
behind it to be able
to capitalize on its growth.
I've risked a lot
to make my dream come True.
I've had to give up
my good grades in high school,
my friends, a lot of
my childhood experiences.
So getting a deal
from the sharks
would really make it all
worth it.
Hi. My name is Lani Lazzari.
I'm from
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
and my company
is Simple Sugars.
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
I started simple Sugars
almost seven years ago
when I was 11 years old.
Since infancy, I've suffered
from horrible eczema.
I couldn't find
a single product that I could
safely use
on my sensitive skin,
let alone one
that actually smelled good.
So, as a determined
11-year-old,
I started doing research
and got to work
creating the product
I was looking for.
My homemade creation
not only took away my eczema,
but it also cleared up
my Aunt's psoriasis.
Soon I was getting requests
from my friends and family
to buy my products.
I couldn't pass up
the opportunity
to become a businesswoman,
despite the fact that I wasn't
even a teenager yet.
Simple Sugars products are
all-Natural sugar scrubs.
They gently exfoliate,
providing deep moisture
and complete skin nourishment
in one easy step.
The result is super smooth,
great-Looking skin
without using a laundry list
of products.
Up until this point,
I've been growing simple sugars
while simultaneously being
a high school student.
Now that I've graduated,
I'm ready to do
whatever it takes
to blow the lid off this thing.
But I need a little help.
That's where you guys come in.
Lori, I would love it
if you would come up
and try out the products.
Now, I have three of
our bestselling body scrubs
to choose from.
Would you like to try
strawberry, coconut,
or lemonade?
Uh, strawberry.
Okay.
Here, take a smell.
Ooh, that smells great.
S--
Gonna give you a little
bit of water.
She might melt.
(laughter)
I'm gonna give you
a little bit of scrub.
Okay. So now you
want to scrub
until it feels like the sugar
crystals start to melt.
They have a very small
crystal size,
which means that sugar is
a very gentle exfoliant,
so it's safe
for sensitive skin.
They're
completely all-natural.
They have no
artificial colorings,
preservatives, scents,
anything in them.
All of the oils are chosen
because they're safe
for sensitive skin, and also
because they absorb quickly,
so you're left feeling
smooth and not greasy.
So... wanna dry 'em off?
And how do they feel?
It feels very, very soft.
Yeah.
So that's the oils in it?
The--
that's the oils in it.
The sugar removes the barrier
of dead skin cells
that naturally sits on top
of your skin...
smells great.
Which allows the oils
to penetrate into your skin
and provide that moisture.
Where have you been
selling this?
60% of our sales are on
the simple sugars Web site.
Okay.
But we also do
wholesale as well.
And we are in our largest
local high-End grocery chain.
What are your sales, Lani?
Our sales year-to-date
are $55,000.
What do you think you'll do
this calendar year?
This calendar year,
we're projecting
very conservatively
$100,000.
What do you think
you'll make on it?
Our profit margins
are 75% to 80%.
But you're not paying yourself
anything yet?
Sometimes I take
a small salary--
Um, $400 a month--When we
have the cash flow for it.
Couple gummi bears, Yeah.
Yeah. (laughs)
(Robert) Lani,
I'm more interested
than the money right now--
How did you come up
with the formulas?
Like, uh, like the chemistry
behind it?
I was more aware
of skin care products
than the average 11-year-old,
'cause I was always
at the dermatologist's office
with all of these problems.
So I started doing research,
and, to be honest,
I just got obsessed with it.
So I just started,
through trial and error,
making products
and trying them on myself.
You don't have
any mainstream distribution.
You're a niche player
online.
You have $100,000 in sales.
But it's not worth
a million dollars.
Now, tell me why--
I don't care what age you are.
If you bring out here
a million-dollar valuation,
you gotta defend it.
Yes.
So defend it.
I am willing to negotiate
on that,
but there are a few things
I'd like you to consider first.
In 2010, I was a sophomore
in high school.
My sales were $13,000.
At that point, I decided
that I wanted to actually
focus on growing
this business.
So I basically took
the whole year off
to work full-time
on growing the business.
As a result of my efforts
that year,
my sales grew to $38,000,
a 192% increase,
and I did all of that
by myself
with no funding and no help
as a high school student.
Now, in the past three months
since I've graduated
and been able to work
full-time,
I have grown simple sugars'
retail presence
from 6 stores to 20.
I've made it
the top-Selling specialty brand
in our local high-End
grocery chain,
and I'm in the process
of negotiating
a deal worth
$150,000 to $400,000
over the next two years
with a high-End online
Skin care retailer.
You said that it cured
your own eczema and psoriasis.
It's really hard to be able
to make a claim like that.
We don't make any claims
about what the product
will do for you.
What we do talk a lot
about is the benefits
of each individual
ingredient,
which is something
you can say.
But we can't make any claims
about it curing eczema
or psoriasis. I can only
speak from my experience.
What does your dermatologist
say when you go back to him
or her and present this
to them,
and is he recommending--
Or her--recommending it
to his other patients?
Oh, yes, definitely.
She uses the products.
She loves them.
'cause I have three kids,
and my wife literally
would come and make
your bed every day...
yes.
I would, too, for that matter,
if it kept my--My son
in particular from itching
all over.
(laughs)
Yes.
Well, it's a huge problem.
There are 30 million people
in the United States
that have eczema,
and 52% of the population
describes themselves
as having sensitive skin.
We heavily market it
as a product for sensitive skin.
That's something that
we can say.
And you're allowed to say that?
Right.
Oh, yes. We're perfectly
allowed to say that.
It is one of the hardest things
you could do with your life,
starting a business,
being an entrepreneur.
Oh, yes.
What inspired you to start
your own business?
When I was much younger,
my mom went on maternity leave
with my youngest brother.
And while she was away
on maternity leave,
she got passed over
for a promised promotion.
At that point,
I was very discouraged,
especially as a woman,
about one day
going into
the corporate world.
So from that point on,
I decided
that I wanted to be
an entrepreneur
so I could be responsible
for my own success.
I was the same way.
I didn't want to be
under control
of somebody else.
I wanted to lead
my own destiny.
Yes.
And I am super impressed that
you are doing what you're doing.
I-I do want to know what--what
are you gonna do with the money?
$50,000 is going to go towards
hiring 2 part-time salespeople
to support
our initial accounts.
Because right now I'm focusing
too much of my time
on supporting the accounts
we already have,
and not enough time
on seeking out larger accounts.
And where are you currently
making the goods and--
is this all out of your house?
No, not anymore.
We have a facility
in pittsburgh.
Everything is made there,
and that's also
where we have our offices.
I have three employees
who do all the manufacturing
of the products.
Uh, I really am questioning,
do you really need us,
or--Or me?
Because you're doing great.
You can grow yourself,
and I would not complement
your business,
and I think it would be,
um, counterproductive
for us to partner up
in that sense.
So, with that said,
I'm out.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Lani, I love you.
I think you are amazing.
Amazing.
The quality's great.
It smells great.
I'm so impressed by you.
Thank you.
But...
Lani, I love you.
I think you are amazing.
Amazing.
Thank you.
And the quality's great,
it smells great.
But for me, I think there's
too much competition
with scrubs out there,
so I'm not going to offer you
any money...
okay.
For this.
I'm out.
(Kevin) Okay, Lani.
Here's what I know
is a reality.
The cosmetics industry,
of which you're a part of,
is the most competitive
on earth. Why?
Because the only products that
have higher margins are illegal.
(chuckles) Yes.
(Lori chuckles)
It's virtually impossible
to get share
from the large companies
that own this space.
There's absolutely
nothing proprietary
of what you're doing
at all.
It's so simple to do that
even an 11-year-Old can do it,
and apparently has.
Yes.
But what really strikes me is,
you think it's worth
a million dollars.
Yes.
Not a chance in hell,
no matter how wonderful
your story is.
(chuckles)
I'm not interested. I'm out.
Lani, I think if the measure
of success in a business
was drive and passion,
your business would be
successful.
Yes.
I-I think my challenge
with it is
it is a very, very
difficult task
that you're trying to take on.
For me to give you
the $100,000,
I would have to negotiate
such a value from you,
that it's... unequitable
to you...
yes.
And it becomes
unequitable to me.
Yes.
And you don't want
to do that...
No.
And I don't want to do that
to you.
No, and--
So on this investment,
I'm out.
Four sharks are out.
Mark is Lani's last chance
for an investment.
I'm not an expert
in this market, obviously.
Yes.
All I know is the suffering
my kids go through.
Yes.
So I want you
to explain to me
for my 3-year-old son--
He's got it all right here
where his eczema is.
Mm-hmm.
What should he do?
What product should he be using?
Eczema is a scaly,
dry skin condition.
So gentle exfoliation
is really important
to helping alleviate it.
So the scrubs,
with the blend of the sugar
and the oils
that are in there--
That's especially what's good
to use on eczema.
So...
okay. Who do you see
as your primary competition,
and name the company name.
Fresh.
And why do you think they're
your primary competition?
Because they have
a very comparable product
quality-wise,
and most of the time,
we get customers
who come to us from
using a fresh scrub
and switch to our company,
because we are
more affordable than them.
I don't think we ever heard
the cost for your product.
They're $15.95
for the large size,
which is this size.
And how much does a comparable
fresh product cost?
$74.
And the cost
to make the scrub?
$3.61.
And how low do you think
you can get that cost?
Uh, I can cut it at least
in half by doubling the sales.
Mark, has she convinced you?
She's darn good.
Okay, here's what
I'm willing to do.
I'm willing
to invest $100,000...
okay.
For 33% of the company.
Okay.
And the reason why 33%
from where you are is,
there's gonna be considerable,
um, requirements of my time.
And I value my time.
I'd like to counter.
Okay.
Would you accept $100,000
for 25% equity?
No, I would not.
Okay. So you won't go
any lower than 33%?
No.
Mark... I would love
to accept your offer.
That's what I like to hear.
I'm very excited
to work together.
So am I. Congratulations.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thanks, sweetie.
And please take some home
to your kids as Well,
so they can try it out.
Trust me, I'm already
grabbin' everybody's.
Great.
Thank you so much.
Thanks. Congratulations,
Lani.
Thank you.
(Lori) Congratulations.
(Mark) Nice job.
Thank you.
You're amazing.
She was one of the best pitchers
we've had here
at any age.
She was 18.
If that's our future,
we are in good hands.
We're in really good shape.
In the future, I hope
that I will be an inspiration
to other young entrepreneurs
and encourage them
to follow their dreams
and that if you're passionate
and you're committed,
you can do it.
