Are people that big slobs
that they're dropping stuff
in their car all the time?
Have you never dropped
anything down that gap before?
Even just could be
your phone, your keys.
I mean, everybody says,
"why didn't
I think of this idea?"
or, "god,
this happened to me."
Really?
This is a very serious
problem that happens.

Hello, sharks.
My name is Jeffrey Miller.
Jeffrey, are those the ones
you did before?
Yes. I did all of these
last night.
But, Jeffrey, what happened

Well, we couldn't
fulfill the orders,

have the money.
Jeffrey, you gotta--
You gotta demonstrate this.
I know.
Is there anything else
like this out on the market?
There is not. I have
a patent on it.
Not at all?
Nothing.
It's a utility patent?
It's a utility patent.
You cannot make
anything like this.
