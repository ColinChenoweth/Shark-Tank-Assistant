are Jeffrey Simon
and Marc Newburger,
with a business
to help make sure
that nothing ever
slips through the cracks.
Howdy, sharks,
I'm Marc Newburger...
and I'm Jeffrey Simon,
and our company is...
(together) Drop stop!
We're here today
seeking a $300,000 investment
in exchange for
a 15% stake in our company.
Now, sharks, let me
ask you a question--
Have you ever dropped anything
down that gap
between the seat
and center console in your car?
You know what
I'm talking about--
That black hole,
that dark abyss,
the pit of doom.
What we like to call
the car-muda triangle.
(laughs)
That place that eats up
your cell phone,
your keys, loose change,
parking and credit cards,
and all sorts of food items,
like the French fry.
Tell me.
How many of you have
a 2-year-old
petrified French fry
sittin' down in that gap?
Who hasn't struggled, gotten
on their hands and knees,
Butt up in the air,
trying to retrieve
what just fell down there?
Well today,
your crack problems are over...
car seat crack, that is.
Introducing drop stop--
the first-of-Its-kind,
original patented safety device
designed to once and for all
block that pesky,
yet ever-so-dangerous gap
between your car seat
and center console.
Drop stop
reduces driver distraction
by Keeping your eyes
on the road, not in your gap.
Drop stop is universal
to fit any car or truck.
The built-In slot is designed
to fit easily
around the seat belt catch
like so...
Which anchors it
to the seat...
(Robert laughs)
So it can never
fall through to the floor.
And wherever your seat goes,
drop stop follows.
The stretchy,
durable material
is designed to last the life
of your vehicle and beyond,
and drop Stop's squishy center
allows it to expand or contract
to fit any size gap.
You won't even know
it's there...
till it stops the drop.
So, sharks, we can make
a lot of money together.
But we can also save
a lot of lives together.
So we're asking y'all
just this once
to lay down your dorsal fins
and join us to make
dropping and driving...
(together)
a thing of the past.
(laughs)
How much money is there
in solving
the car-Muda triangle problem?
We have actually sold
over 260,000 units.
You've sold 260,000 units?
Yes.
Yes.
130,000 sets,
or 260,000 units.
How many dollars
did that equate to?
Uh, we have had gross sales,
since we opened our doors
in 2009, of $1.3 million.
This year,
how much will you do?
This year, we have made
$300,000 in gross sales,
and we have net $50,000.
For the fourth quarter,
which is one of
our biggest times of the year,
we have commitments
and things are in the works
to actually gross $500,000.
And from that, we will be making
$260,000 net income.
What is your mode of selling?
Where are you selling this?
We sell on our web site,
we sell through the catalogs,
and, Marc, where's
the other big one
we've been working on?
Well, we've actually had
42 shows on qvc.
And I'm speaking to
the queen herself right here.
And we--
42 times
it's been on qvc?
Yes. We just
had two shows last week,
in fact, we had
one scheduled for today...
today.
That we had to skip,
unfortunately, because--
This is much cooler
than qvc.
We love qvc. We love qvc.
That's right.
Everybody loves qvc.
(laughs)
Can we see 'em, guys?
Yeah.
Absolutely. Marc,
please give it to them.
With the packaging.
Yeah, with the packaging.
Are people that big slobs
that they're dropping stuff
in their car all the time?
Have you never dropped
anything down that gap before?
Even just could be
your phone, your keys.
I mean, everybody says,
"why didn't
I think of this idea?"
or, "god,
this happened to me."
Really?
This is a very serious
problem that happens.
The United States
department of transportation
said There are
over 500,000 accidents
and over 5,000 fatalities
that happen
from driver distraction
alone.
And, Marc,
why don't you share
how we actually
came up with the idea,
and I think that'll help...
okay.
You know.
About four and a half years ago,
we both live in Los Angeles,
I was driving
on sunset boulevard,
and my phone was just
sitting on the center console.
And when it rang, it shimmied
off and fell down the gap,
and I went to go
reach for it really quick,
and I tugged
the wheel to the right.
I looked up,
all four tires went up
onto the sidewalk,
I literally saw a guy
superman-leap
3 feet out of the way--
I would have killed him--
And I missed hitting
a telephone pole by an inch.
Wow.
And I just
started screaming,
"why doesn't somebody
come up with a way
to block this stupid crack?!"
there has to be a better way!
(laughs)
I agree!
What's it cost to make these,
and what do you sell 'em for?
Our cost to us is $4.
For one or two?
For a set of two.
For two.
$2 apiece.
$2 apiece.
And for retail,
it sells for $19.99.
So we're talking about
a markup of $5,
which we know is a very
attractive number to investors.
And you have to sell it
to retailers for $10.
Right.
Hold on.
I'm not there yet,
but I will get to that.
(Lori laughs)
Obviously, retailers
want a 50% markup.
So we sell it for $10.
We're making a gross profit
of $6.
Retail is the next big game,
which is why we're really here.
Do you have
intellectual property?
We have a patent.
(Lori) a utility patent.
A utility patent.
On?
On the actual product,
drop stop.
On putting stuff between a seat
and a center console?
An elongated member
with--With a slot that goes
around the seat belt catch.
(laughing)
We--We own that area, baby.
And--And there have been...
you are a sick puppy.
(laughs)
I can't believe people
are dropping that much stuff.
Like, it never happens to me.
Robert, just go out there
and look in my car.
(laughs)
(laughs) Thank you.
I'm not a believer
in the product.
I'm not the right investor.
I'm out.
Thank you, anyway.
Respectfully,
we understand that.
Thank you.
You know,
I-I like the story.
I think you guys
are making money.
I mean, where I'm from,
that--That space
is really, really special.
Because when somebody
pulls you over,
you can get three to five
on rikers island
if you don't have that space
to drop something down there.
(laughter)
Thankfully,
that hasn't happened yet.
I'm not saying that I ever
did anything like that.
Um, the--the sales are
showing that it's a need,
but it's not something
that I believe in.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Guys, I think
it's a phenomenal product.
I'm gonna take
the one you gave me,
and I'm gonna use it,
you know?
Because I'm--I'm a slob.
(laughs)
But being a slob, and being
a customer for the product
is different than being
the right person
to help you sell it.
You know, you've
already got qvc,
and Lori's
the right person for that.
So if I could
add value, I would,
but, guys,
I have to say I'm out.
Okay.
That's a bummer.
Bummer.
For me,
this isn't just a product.
It's a dream.
It is a calling.
If you can just
save someone's life once,
it's worth it.
I see the value, guys.
I really, really do.
Um, but it takes
a commitment to do it right.
I would be nothing more
than a checkbook to you guys,
and you guys are asking
for more than that.
Absolutely, and thank you
for being honest.
Yeah.
I like being a checkbook.
(both laugh)
I like to hear that.
Yeah.
You know, I think
the problem with this deal
is it's not really a company.
It's a product.
Right now what it does is,
it uses capital.
The bigger it grows,
it just sucks cash.
The bigger you get,
the more distribution you get,
the more money
you're gonna need.
Now for the investor,
Mr. Checkbook here--
Mr. Wonderful checkbook,
you can call me that--
I look at it
and say to myself,
"okay, I'll give you
$300,000."
You know, and right now that
money is hanging onto my leg,
it's saying,
"daddy, where am I going?"
I say, "nowhere yet.
I'm thinking about it.
You may go
to summer camp now."
It says, "no, daddy, no!
I wanna make sure I come home."
(laughs)
And so I'm thinking
to myself,
before I send
these little soldiers off,
I gotta figure out a way
that they come home
with more friends.
The idea is
send the dollars out,
they capture some,
they come back to daddy.
That's how it works.
So I give you the $300,000,
I don't want
any equity in your company.
But what I want is,
every time you sell
one of these foam weenies,
I get $2 back.
I mean, that would
end up leaving us
with a dollar
left for ourselves
after it's said and done,
if we're making $3
on each individual drop Stop.
Yeah, it's okay.
You're growing market share.
Well, you know, they say
money can't buy happiness.
And I agree. But...
I can easily
make you millionaires.
Jeffrey and Mark have an offer
from Kevin O'Leary
of $300,000 for a $2 royalty
on each unit sold.
But Lori
also seems interested.
They say
money can't buy happiness.
And I agree. But...
I can easily
make you millionaires.
I can get you
into retailers,
across the country
and internationally.
And so I'm going
to make you an offer.
I'm going to offer you
the $300,000.
But I'm going to ask
for 20%,
because I understand
what it's going to take
for me to do all of this.
But I think
you guys are a hero,
and I think the product's
a real hero.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I'd love for you
to say "Yes" right now.
Can you imagine how much equity
you're giving up?
Boy, that hurts.
20%?
A lot.
I'm thinking I'll make it
more interesting for you.
I'll do it with my offer
because I am Mr. Wonderful,
let's remember that.
You are.
Instead of keeping
the $2 royalty on
after I recoup my capital,
it drops to $1.
Here--We need a moment,
right now, of money meditation.
Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath.
Visualize yourself sailing
on a boat with me
around Martha's Vineyard
next year.
Me handing you a check
for millions of dollars.
Now open your eyes...
and take the offer.
You're giving up equity,
which is very expensive
when one day, somebody
wants to buy this company.
Correct.
Lori, the Savage,
took 20% for herself.
But really,
she's really good for qvc,
but what's she gonna do
for retail?
If you don't make
a decision right now,
I swear I'm gonna
throw the weenie at you.
(both laugh)
on behalf
of both of us, Lori,
we would love
to be partners with you.
Whoo-Hoo!
Thank you.
Aah! Almost fell
on the weenie.
That almost fell
down the gap! (laughs)
So excited. It's great.
We're so excited.
Thank you so much
for understanding and believing.
Whoo! Lori!
Lori, you'll make
a lot of money with this.
I agree.
This is a great product.
Lori, we will be
sailing with you
on that boat
at Martha's Vineyard.
I cannot wait.
Oh, chef Jeffrey?
Would you come out here, please?
(laughs) Oh, no.
The sharks are feeding.
Oh...
no.
No.
That's right, folks.
Today we are serving lionfish.
It's delicious, nutritious,
and perfectly safe to eat,
I assure you.
What would you liken it to?
What type of fish,
the way it tastes?
I would say it's similar
to snapper or grouper.
Chicken.
Chicken? (laughs)
So you are selling it?
Oh, absolutely, yeah.
And what do you call it
when you sell it?
We call it lionfish.
Why? Like sea Bass wasn't
originally called sea Bass.
It had some nasty name
for whatever...
patagonian toothfish.
Yeah,
the patagonian toothfish.
There you go. Right.
Right. Right. Yeah.
Sea Bass sure sounds
a whole lot better.
Well, you're right, mark.
In that regard,
it does sound better.
But on the other hand, uh,
we're promoting this as
an opportunity for people
to help the ecology
by consuming the fish.
So that's why we wanted
to keep the name lionfish.
But, mark, if you
wanna give us money,
we'll call it
anything you want.
We'll--We'll call it
the cubanfish.
(laughs) It tastes good.
I mean, do you guys like it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean,
it tastes like, uh...
flounder.
Delicious.
I'm familiar with
the lionfish from aquariums.
'cause it's
a very beautiful fish.
Until you told me today
that it's a danger
to all the other fish,
I never realized that.
(Mark) Yeah.
The fact that it has
no predators.
It's proliferating
in the caribbean,
and there's just
no stopping that.
And you're saying that's bad
for the underwater environment?
It eats snapper.
It eats the herbivorous fish.
How does that little guy
eat a lobster?
Lobster larvae.
Lobster larvae.
But doesn't every fish
eat lobster larvae?
It sounds like a delicacy.
Yeah, it does sound
like a--
Yeah.
I would guess that
every fish does, but--
So aren't we being
a little negative on this guy?
(mark laughs)
No, we're not.
Trust me, Kevin.
But I'm amazed that this
is so delicious.
I'm-a go home to my fish tank
and Lemon and tartar up,
uh... ol' skippy.
(laughter)
But let me ask you
something.
Yeah, sure.
If they taste that delicious,
why haven't anybody else
harvested this, uh,
fish out of the sea?
It's very labor intensive.
It's taken us a long time
and it's cost us
a lot of money.
What's the process
of catching them?
They don't bite on a hook,
and they live in caves
of the reef.
Of the reefs, yeah.
So you can't net them.
So they're only speared.
And we deal with, uh,
mexican spearing cooperatives.
How can you scale it if you
have to Spear each one of 'em?
There's a surprising number
of, uh,
Spear fishing cooperatives
in the caribbean.
So how does the cost
of the fish per pound
compare to other fish,
like sea Bass or Trout
or whatever?
It would comparable
to probably sea Bass,
grouper, uh, snapper.
So there's not really
a cost element here?
So you've really gotta
like the taste
and be willing to choose it
and possibly be willing
to choose your dinner
based off of some
ecological factors?
That and the taste.
I mean...
how does the consumer know
they should eat this?
Well, that's been a challenge,
because we essentially
are introducing a new fish
into the U.S. Market.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jeffrey Miller.
And my product
is called coolwraps.
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange
for 40% equity in my company.
Let me ask you a question--
When was the last time
you had fun gift wrapping?
Well, if you're
anything like me,
and I'm gift wrap-Challenged,
the answer is "Never"...
until now.
Allow me to introduce you
to coolwraps.
Coolwraps is
a shrink wrap gift bag
that is so easy to use.
We say it's as easy
as 1-2-3...
stuff it, Seal it,
shrink it.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Simply place a gift
into a bag.
Remove the protective film
from the adhesive strip.
Fold it over and close it
like you would an envelope.
And now with a hair Dryer,
you shrink it to fit.
(whirring)
Simply run the hair Dryer
around the present,
and you will instantly
see it start to shrink.
Have you noticed
there's no tape, no scissors,
no hassle,
and absolutely no mess?
It's amazing.
And in no time, you will have
a wonderfully wrapped gift.
(Dryer turns off)
Jeffrey, are those the ones
you did before?
Yes. I did all of these
last night.
And unlike regular
gift wrapping,
I had fun doing it.
I mean, coolwraps... (laughs)
Coolwraps is a great product,
and it's proven,
and it's great.
Um...
it is an amazing product.
I love it.
I'm passionate about it.
I mean, it's perfect
for everyone.
As I said, young and old,
male and female.
And if you have
dexterity issues, it's perfect.
This is a game-Changer now.
This is an amazing product.
Jeff, can you tell us
about the business?
This product was out on
the market about ten years ago.
Then what happened?
We were a partnership,
and we got it out
into the market,
we got on qvc twice,
and we sold out.
We got tested in cvs,
and we sold out.
We went to the banks.
We needed money to roll it out,
and we couldn't get it.
We had purchase orders in hand.
And they just wanted us
to collateralize our homes.
They didn't care
about the orders.
Well, how much were you
asking for from the bank?
We needed, in order to fulfill
the larger quantities
that we were
getting orders for,
we needed $300,000
to $500,000.
Jeff, when the bank manager
was willing to lend you that
money--pretend I'm him--
I say, "Jeff, I'm very excited
"About your gift wrap bag,
shrink wrap, whatever.
"I hope you're as excited
as I am,
"because I'm gonna
lend you the money,
"and I'm gonna put
as a collateral your home.
"But you have
no problem with that,
because you believe
in the product."
I did.
But the partnership--
in total,
we had already put in
over $150,000 into it.
Why didn't the other partners
also believe
and be willing
to put up their homes?
Well, we didn't want--
This is the test
of a real entrepreneur.
I--absolutely.
Do you take the chance?
Do you bet it all?
I'm there with you.
Obviously, you weren't
there with him,
because you said No.
Why did you say no?
I didn't say no.
The consensus was no.
I wanted to bring in
venture capital.
What percentage
of the company did you own?
I was a 20% shareholder.
And so fast forward to today.
Yes.
How much of it do you own?
I own 100% of this.
But, Jeffrey, what happened
to the other partners?
Well, we couldn't
fulfill the orders,
they gave up,
and I acquired everything.
What's happened?
Why for ten years
did you do nothing with it?
I've not been able to get
in front of the right people.
I have been to trade shows,
I have tried
to get the word out there.
Did you stand there
with a blow Dryer,
sealing,
getting people excited?
Um, no. I went around
and tried to hand out my cards
and get--Give some...
Oh, my gosh.
So nobody saw
the product in action?
No.
Nobody knew
what you were really selling?
No.
So you didn't have a Booth?
You were just
going around trolling?
Correct.
I didn't--I didn't
have the money.
Jeffrey, you gotta--
You gotta demonstrate this.
I know.
Is there anything else
like this out on the market?
There is not. I have
a patent on it.
Not at all?
Nothing.
It's a utility patent?
It's a utility patent.
You cannot make
anything like this.
And how much does it cost you
to make one bag?
Um... on average...
on average.
Price is between
11 to 18 cents a bag.
And then what did you sell them
for when you sold them on qvc?
What was your offer?
Qvc was a 20-Pack,
and they had a special price
of--I think it was $16.88.
Have you called anybody
to try and license this?
No. I-I don't know
how to go about it,
and that's why
I need your help.
So you want us to bet
on a 10-year-Old product
'cause you think we'll
bring it back into the market,
and bingo--It'll come back.
Actually, I think--
I am so happy
that it's happening now,
because manufacturing processes
have improved.
We can bring cost down.
Jeff, it--It's great
that you love it,
but my gosh--ten years?
You--You've gotta
go and sell some.
And obviously,
you're not the sales guy.
I don't see the market.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
I'm not sure
about this product at all.
I think it has potential,
and I like
that you have a patent.
I also think
it's a good tv product,
but I think it needs
a lot of revamping.
So what if I were
to give you $150,000
and just buy you out?
Whoa.
You make $150,000.
The risk is mine.
Because I'm really not sure.
I don't like
that for ten years it sat.
But I'm willing
to take the Gamble.
You can continue
to do other things.
You don't have
a 10-year dinosaur.
And it becomes my problem
or my success.
I'll tell you what--
I'll give you $250,000
for the whole company...
and a 3% royalty,
but it's yes or no
right now.
Whoa.
Aggressive.
Look at these sharks circling.
Yes or no?
Mark, I accept your offer.
Done.
(Kevin) whoa!
I like the way you think.
Wow.
Congratulations.
You're a rich man.
Thank you very much.
How does it feel
to have 250 grand?
That's amazing.
Yes, it is. That's how we
do business, right?
Uhh. Done.
Lori, can I wrap
any presents for you?
Yes! (laughs)
Mark, I think that was
the fastest deal
we've ever done.
(laughs)
Next?
