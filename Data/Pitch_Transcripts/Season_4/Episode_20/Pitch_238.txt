are Dave Johnson
and Gary Groomes,
who have a unique solution to
a looming ecological problem.
Hi. I'm Dave Johnson,
president and founder
of traditional fisheries.
And I'm Gary groomes,
vice president.
We need $225,000 in exchange
for a 25% share.
We need your help
to fight a war
against
an environmental terrorist--
the lionfish. The worst invasive
Marine species in history,
capable of causing an economic
and ecological disaster.
Long prized for its beauty,
this exotic Fish
was imported from the Pacific
and sold
in Tropical fish stores.
Well, about 20 years ago,
somebody dumped
and handful of them
into the Atlantic ocean.
Since then, they've multiplied
like a supercomputer.
This map will demonstrate
the extent
of the lionfish spread
over the past 20 years.
You see, the lionfish,
because of its venomous spines,
has no natural predator.
And already, it is
the second most populous fish
in the western atlantic
and the caribbean.
And it eats
just about anything.
Right,
including valuable species,
like snapper, grouper, lobster,
shrimp, and crab,
that thousands of fisheries
and millions of people
depend on for survival.
And it gets worse.
Now they also feast on fish
that are crucial to keeping
Coral reefs alive.
Our oceans
are already in crisis.
And the lionfish
could be the straw
that breaks the camel's back.
But, sharks, we have
a solution to this problem.
Mm-hmm.
(together) to beat 'em,
just eat 'em.
But, Dave, if this is
such a problem,
why is the government
not all over this?
I've never seen anything
of this danger.
You're telling me
that the reefs are gonna die.
Robert, I honestly think
the problem is
a lack of funding right now
because so many programs
have been cut.
At least that's what
we're hearing
from the people that we talk to
in the government.
So let's go to the business
side of it.
How much fish have you sold
in the last year?
Um, we've grossed $12,000.
Sales?
Yes.
Sales.
Boy, is that ever small.
Let me tell you where I stand.
I think you have a tremendous
market acceptance problem
ahead of you.
You did a good job of explaining
the problem, but...
Mm-hmm.
I don't care how much supply
you have if there's no demand.
I'm out.
All right. Well, thanks
for your time, Robert.
So, on cape cod
at the turn of the century,
the lobster was considered
the cockroach of the sea.
Mm.
Nobody would eat it.
That's why they fed it
to prisoners.
It took 40 years
to convince Boston society
that that cockroach
was a delicacy,
and now it trades
for, you know,
$15 a pound sometimes
in restaurants.
40 years is a long time.
Now, that little cockroach
May take just as long
to convince people to eat it.
You'll both be dead
before that's mainstream.
I won't be,
'cause I'm a vampire.
(laughter)
But in the meantime, I'm out.
All right. Thanks for your time,
Kevin. Appreciate it.
Guys, I think this is
just gonna be a huge
educational challenge,
and, uh,
$225,000 is just not
gonna do it.
I'm out.
Thank you.
All right, thanks, daymond.
It is a good problem
to solve.
It is
a high leverage problem,
meaning that if you can
solve it,
you can make a lot,
a lot, a lot of money.
But your catch-22 is
it's gonna take a lot of money.
You really haven't asked
for enough to solve a problem.
You haven't said, "look,
"This is how we're gonna
market it
just to one community
to--to find the demand."
So I'm out.
Thanks.
Thank you, mark.
I'm for anything that helps
the ecology,
and I hope that some kind
of solution happens
in a more global way
with More help
than just the two of you.
But I can't see people
running to eat lionfish.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Well, thank you all
for your time.
Good luck, guys.
Very much so.
Good luck.
Congratulations, too.
It was very interesting.
Bye-Bye.
It's a beautiful fish.
I want to go see
that fish.
I know. They're great
in aquariums.
They're so cool.
Look at the--look at
the tips on those spines.
It's beautiful.
It's also quite unattractive
when it's Fried up.
It's primordial.
I love the fish.
I think it's beautiful.
I didn't realize it was
such a big problem.
He's not looking
so good now.
We didn't get a deal,
but we're gonna move forward
and we're gonna fight
this damn fish.
There's more lionfish
in the sea today
than there were yesterday.
And that's gonna continue
to happen
until somebody does
something about it.
