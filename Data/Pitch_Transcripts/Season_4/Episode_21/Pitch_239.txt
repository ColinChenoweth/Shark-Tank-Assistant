Sorry, can I--
You're screwing up, Rusty.
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Lori Greiner,
the queen of qvc,
holds over a hundred patents
and has launched
over 300 products,
grossing over
a half a billion dollars
in retail sales.
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert
who grew his homemade
clothing line
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu.
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first
internet companies
for over $350 million.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.
But here is my challenge--
I didn't know about you
until you walked out here,
I buy stuff like this
all the time...
Sure.
As corporate gifts
for our corporate customers.
But Kevin's right.
It's very, very expensive
to find those people.
These people mail me,
they e-mail me,
they blast me
all kinds of stuff.
And I'm--I'm struggling
with the $300,000.
Like, I-I know that's
a lot of money.
But I don't know. I think
it's gonna cost a lot more.
(Daymond) Yeah, I mean, my--
My challenge is the same thing.
You're going up against
the big boys now
with our dollars.
One point that you said to me
that would help you
that was attractive was
yours is a $49 ham.
And I think the other hams
out there are like $69, $79.
And that's
at a smaller weight also.
So they're
significantly higher...
uh-huh.
With not as much product also.
I think that's
a real distinct advantage,
'cause the other stuff--
You're right, Lori--
Is way more money.
(Kevin) I don't know if it's--
It's actually--Yeah,
it's not an advantage at all
because you're not making money.
They're--they're selling
their product at a higher price
because, obviously,
they have to.
(Lori) They're making more.
Yeah.
But again, I've only targeted
60 miles around Peoria.
I think it's a--It's a big
challenge ahead of you.
I'm out.
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.
I do have--I have a--
I have a--
Definitely an answer
for that.
Um--
Go ahead. You got
four other sharks.
My name is Rusty Allen.
I'm an industrial design
entrepreneur
and the founder
of gobieh2o.
I'm asking for
a $300,000 investment
for 10% of my company.
Four years ago,
when the recession hit
I realized I was spending
more money
on single-use water bottles
per gallon
than I was on the gas that
I was putting into my car.
(thuds)
And that pissed me off.
And that's when I decided
to develop gobie.
Gobie is the world's
most advanced filtered
water bottle on the market.
Our flex flow technology
allows you to have
the durability of a hard-shell
with the accessibility
of a soft-shell.
What that allows you to do
is have clean,
purified water instantly.
One thing that I realized
after developing this product
was we could filter out
way more than just tap water,
and I'd love to show you
what I mean by that.
With our upgraded filter,
we have the ability
to filter out
99.99% of all contaminants
found in water.
For the purpose
of this demo,
I'm just gonna take ordinary
dirt and throw it in there.
This is
really fine potting soil.
Shake it up.
This is disgusting,
dirty, dirty water
that no one
would ever want to drink.
Now with this upgraded filter,
it allows the ability
to filter out clean,
purified water instantly,
anywhere you go.
Mm.
Oh.
So I would love to
show you guys this product
in person.
Ladies first.
Thank you.
You bet.
There you go.
Thanks, Rusty.
You bet.
Here you go.
Thank you, Rusty.
Which one of you sharks
wants to invest in clean,
purified gobie success?
Are you looking to sell this,
Rusty,
as a mainstream product
in America
to compete with all the other
water containers
or are you trying to go
into the specialty niche
of providing purified water
in countries
where it's not available?
Right now, the special filter
is a prototype.
And that's a great thing,
and that was--
That shows the power
of our technology.
But my main Focus right now
is to compete with single-Use
water bottles here in America.
But don't you think,
here in America,
people are pretty comfortable
filling up
their existing bottles today
with water out of the tap?
They don't need
the extra cost of a filter.
Kevin's right, shockingly.
Not only are we accepting
tap water
or other forms of water
outside of the bottle,
but there's also other filters
that filter good enough.
(Robert) Yeah, Rusty.
I mean, my kids have
a water bottle,
and it has a filter
on the inside of it.
And they've had that
for, my gosh, three years.
But probably not the same
kind of filter this is.
No, it is.
The only difference I see
in yours
is that you have this soft,
compressible area
and a Harder shell--
The two combined together.
I haven't seen that, but...
okay.
I have seen
multiple products
where there is a filter
just like yours
that takes out 99.9%
of the contaminants...
okay.
That you can either put into
different water bottles...
Yeah.
Or that already come
built inside.
Right, well, I'll--
I'll show you--
the--I'll show you
the beauty of that technology--
Flex flow technology.
What it allows us to do...
And most--Most squeeze bottles,
they won't last the life
of the filter
because they're not
very durable,
they scratch up.
They end up not holding
a Seal really Well
because it's
soft materials, right?
Well,
the hard-Shell bottles
are really good,
but if you have a filter
in it,
you have to suck
the water through.
Which really limits what kind
of filter you can put in there.
So the ability to have
a hard-shell
combined with a soft-Shell
is the best of both worlds.
(Robert)
No, but, Rusty, hang on.
You're saying
all the other products,
which do the same thing,
can't filter to a level
that you can?
Yours is so good
that you can filter dirt.
Nobody else can do that?
In the way that we do.
That's a different answer
to a different question.
Well, there--There are--
Okay.
We've tested our filter
in other water bottles,
and we've realized
that this technology--
The flex flow technology--
Builds up a ton
of pressure in here
and allows you to filter out
more than everybody else can.
(Daymond) I never thought
I would say it,
but this is an extremely sexy
water bottle,
you know,
to tell you the truth.
All right.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
How much
does this cost retail?
Retail is $30.
How much
are you making them for?
We're making them for $10
in the U.S. Right now.
We're made in san Diego.
That includes the first filter,
which is for tap water.
That filter lasts 3 months
or 100 gallons.
The consumer buys it
every quarter. Very simple.
Oh, so you have to keep on
re-Buying the filter?
Yeah. Yeah, that's repeat...
okay, let me ask
one more question.
Filter sales.
Did you license the filter
or is this 100% your design?
You did all the work
as an industrial engineer?
As far as the technology of it,
it's a carbon block.
It's--It's--It's free market,
uh, technology.
What were your sales?
Our sales to date,
only online,
have been 10,000 bottles
and 15,000 filters.
What's your total sales?
Revenue, what is that?
Total s--
Revenue is $285,000.
Over what period of time?
17 months.
Okay.
Just so you guys know,
as far as sales,
I've only been selling
the blue bottle.
We went to retail--
Who did you go to?
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
Target, and jcpennys.
What happened?
So they came back
and they said,
"in order to get this in there,
we need more colors."
Wait. I have to stop you
for a minute,
because that doesn't
make sense to me.
If they thought that this was
so original and so unique
and something
that they really wanted,
they would've grabbed it,
they would've tested it.
So my feeling is
you didn't get into them
because there are already
so many others
out there like it,
and they probably have
a less-Expensive version.
I like that you are creative
and that you're trying
to do something
and be an entrepreneur.
But I think there's tons
of competition out there,
and for that reason, I'm out.
Okay. That's fine.
I have a different issue
with you, Rusty,
which we haven't
addressed yet.
Explain to me why
you're worth $3 million today
and how it's gonna be
worth more tomorrow.
Because unless we get
past that, Rusty,
I don't care what colors
the bottles are,
you're not getting
any of my money.
Well, first of all,
you guys know
every human being on the earth--
the richest man in Beverly hills
and the poorest man in Kenya--
Both drink water.
And besides--Besides
breathing oxygen--
That's just a horrible
sales pitch, Rusty.
Come on.
Listen, I'm just saying
how broad it is.
Let me get back to my--
It's an obvious broad market.
(Kevin) Okay, Rusty,
here's the bottom line--
What you should've said is
that you were gonna sell
$3-Million worth
of these bottles
in the next 12 months,
make $500,000 or $600,000
in profit.
I would've had
a debate with you.
We would've stayed engaged.
You never did that.
I'm out.
Rusty, Rusty, let me clarify
your problem for you, okay?
You've got
really cool-looking bottles.
But you're trying to be in
the water filtration business.
The part
that differentiates you,
that makes it
a really cool product,
you're not focusing on
at all.
If you just walked in
and said,
"you know what? We have
the coolest, hippest,
"best-looking bottles
on the planet.
"and by the way,
"if you have a user who has
a need for daily filtration,
we have a solution."
You're screwing up, Rusty.
I see what you're saying.
I was getting caught up
in all the other details.
But the end of the day,
we're able to filter out
more prod--
More, uh, contaminants
than anyone else
because of this.
Rusty, look, I'm--
I'm gonna make it simple.
I'm out, right?
You're selling the wrong thing.
Rusty, you seem like a nice guy,
but that was just
a really convoluted
presentation, my friend.
I mean, that was just
so bad.
I don't think you understand,
uh, the business that you're in.
You're gonna get crushed,
my friend.
Crushed.
I'm out.
I'm sitting here quietly
rooting for you,
but every one
of the other sharks
are bringing up
really, really valuable points.
What do you want
the money for?
We need the money
for inventory
and a little bit
of operating cost.
Like I said,
I'm working 24/7,
seven days a week.
Uh, Rusty, just because--
No, listen.
Rusty, just because
you work hard...
can I finish really quick?
Doesn't mean
you're gonna be successful.
I--No, listen.
I-I want to hear this.
I want to hear this, rob.
I will work Harder than Anyone
has ever worked for you.
I swear.
I've been dedicating
my entire life to this.
I have a pad next to my desk
that I sleep on
and wake up and work.
I do not stop working,
dude.
How much debt
is on the company?
None.
(man) Hey, Rusty.
How's it going?
It's going great, man.
I was, uh, a little confusing,
I guess,
on the way
that I presented things.
Daymond, I'm shocked.
Daymond, that was
the most confusing presentation
we've seen in...
all the sharks are out
except, uh, Daymond.
Okay.
And he's offering 40 per--
$300,000 for 40%.
So basically,
he's valuing the company
at $700,000.
It's so not worth
3 million bucks.
Guys, stop talking me
out of this.
I'm gonna--I'm gonna ask
one more question,
and then if they, uh,
if they're good with it, good.
And, uh, we'll figure it out.
Sounds great. All right.
Good luck, bud.
All right.
There's so much competition,
Daymond.
Yes,
this is a challenge.
But these are
badass-looking bottles.
Okay, Rusty,
before you say anything,
let's just summarize
where we're at.
Okay.
There's only one shark left--
Daymond--
Who's interested in your deal.
He offered you $300,000,
not for 10%--
what you wanted.
It's $300,000 for 40%
with a contingency
that the retailers
you've been talking about
that are so excited
about your product
actually bring it in
and start selling it.
What are you going to do?
I would really, um...
like to see what you thought
about bringing
a couple of more sharks in--
Mark Cuban and Lori--
for the demo purposes
as well as the mavs
and the sports, uh,
licensing potential there.
Rusty, I'll tell you the truth,
to tell you the truth, though,
this is such a gamble
and a flier
that I would want
that big reward.
So I wouldn't want them
in the deal.
$300,000 for 40%.
And you guys are all
still out for sure, 100%?
He just said he didn't
want us in,
so it's his call.
Okay, so you guys--
You guys offers are still
completely off the table
after I left?
Unless you want
to give up more equity.
No. Absolutely. Daymond.
All right. Good.
You're the man.
Let's do this, man.
You guys are r--
Gonna regret this.
I guarantee you, dude.
Actually,
I forgot my bottle.
I'm speechless.
How surprised are you,
D.J.?
I am surprised. I didn't think
he was gonna take 40%.
I was waiting
for you to say no,
and then I could get back
into the royalty game with him.
Squeeze his head
like a teenage pimple.
(laughs)
(laughs)
I think Daymond gets it
and I think we're gonna kill it.
And I think all the sharks
are gonna regret
not being a part of it.
