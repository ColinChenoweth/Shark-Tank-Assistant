Sorry, can I--
You're screwing up, Rusty.
Who are the sharks?
But here is my challenge--
I didn't know about you
until you walked out here,
I buy stuff like this
all the time...
Sure.
As corporate gifts
for our corporate customers.
But Kevin's right.
It's very, very expensive
to find those people.
These people mail me,
they e-mail me,
they blast me
all kinds of stuff.
(Daymond) Yeah, I mean, my--
My challenge is the same thing.
You're going up against
the big boys now
with our dollars.
One point that you said to me
that would help you
that was attractive was
yours is a $49 ham.
I think it's a--It's a big
challenge ahead of you.
I'm out.
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.
I do have--I have a--
I have a--
Definitely an answer
for that.
Um--
Go ahead. You got
four other sharks.
My name is Rusty Allen.
I'm an industrial design
entrepreneur
There you go.
Thanks, Rusty.
You bet.
Here you go.
Thank you, Rusty.
Which one of you sharks
wants to invest in clean,
purified gobie success?
Are you looking to sell this,
Rusty,
as a mainstream product
in America
to compete with all the other
water containers
or are you trying to go
into the specialty niche
of providing purified water
in countries
where it's not available?
Right now, the special filter
is a prototype.
(Robert) Yeah, Rusty.
I mean, my kids have
a water bottle,
(Robert)
No, but, Rusty, hang on.
You're saying
all the other products,
which do the same thing,
can't filter to a level
that you can?
Yours is so good
that you can filter dirt.
Nobody else can do that?
In the way that we do.
That's a different answer
to a different question.
Well, there--There are--
Okay.
We've tested our filter
in other water bottles,
I have a different issue
with you, Rusty,
which we haven't
addressed yet.
Explain to me why
you're worth $3 million today
Because unless we get
past that, Rusty,
I don't care what colors
the bottles are,
you're not getting
any of my money.
Well, first of all,
you guys know
every human being on the earth--
That's just a horrible
sales pitch, Rusty.
Come on.
Listen, I'm just saying
how broad it is.
Let me get back to my--
It's an obvious broad market.
(Kevin) Okay, Rusty,
here's the bottom line--
What you should've said is
that you were gonna sell
$3-Million worth
of these bottles
in the next 12 months,
make $500,000 or $600,000
in profit.
I would've had
a debate with you.
We would've stayed engaged.
You never did that.
I'm out.
Rusty, Rusty, let me clarify
your problem for you, okay?
You've got
really cool-looking bottles.
But you're trying to be in
the water filtration business.
The part
that differentiates you,
that makes it
a really cool product,
you're not focusing on
at all.
You're screwing up, Rusty.
I see what you're saying.
I was getting caught up
in all the other details.
But the end of the day,
we're able to filter out
more prod--
More, uh, contaminants
than anyone else
because of this.
Rusty, look, I'm--
I'm gonna make it simple.
I'm out, right?
You're selling the wrong thing.
Rusty, you seem like a nice guy,
but that was just
a really convoluted
presentation, my friend.
I mean, that was just
so bad.
Uh, Rusty, just because--
No, listen.
Rusty, just because
you work hard...
can I finish really quick?
Doesn't mean
you're gonna be successful.
I--No, listen.
I-I want to hear this.
I want to hear this, rob.
I will work Harder than Anyone
has ever worked for you.
I swear.
I've been dedicating
my entire life to this.
I have a pad next to my desk
that I sleep on
(man) Hey, Rusty.
How's it going?
It's going great, man.
I was, uh, a little confusing,
I guess,
on the way
that I presented things.
Daymond, I'm shocked.
Daymond, that was
the most confusing presentation
we've seen in...
all the sharks are out
except, uh, Daymond.
Okay.
Yes,
this is a challenge.
But these are
badass-looking bottles.
Okay, Rusty,
before you say anything,
let's just summarize
where we're at.
Okay.
There's only one shark left--
Daymond--
Who's interested in your deal.
He offered you $300,000,
not for 10%--
what you wanted.
It's $300,000 for 40%
with a contingency
that the retailers
you've been talking about
that are so excited
about your product
Rusty, I'll tell you the truth,
to tell you the truth, though,
