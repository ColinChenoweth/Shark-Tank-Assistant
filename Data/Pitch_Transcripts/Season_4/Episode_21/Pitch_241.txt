are Jayson Sandberg
and Taylor Gwiazdon,
who believe they've made
a common product
that everybody has
even better.
Hi, my name
is Jayson Sandberg.
And my name is
Taylor Gwiazdon.
We are the proud owners
of liddup corporation,
and we're seeking $100,000
for a 10% equity stake
in our company.
We are very excited
to be here
and to finally introduce
the liddup cooler.
(imitates drumroll)
(both) ? Ahh ?
ahh!
(Lori and Robert laugh)
The liddup cooler is
the first and only cooler
with built-in
L.E.D. lighting.
These bad boys
give you the ability
to find what
you're looking for.
It's as simple as that.
This is not rocket science.
This is exactly how
I came up with the idea.
I was camping
with my family.
I was thirsty,
about four hot dogs deep,
wanting an ice-cold beer.
I went to
my cold, dark cooler.
I began sloshing around,
frozen-handed,
trying to find
what I was looking for.
I found a can. I popped
it open... and it was a soda.
Not what I was looking for.
Oh, no!
(Kevin) Horrible!
(Lori and Robert laugh)
I began my search for a cooler
with lights in it,
and it did not take long
to realize there were none--
None in existence.
So I built my own.
We have working prototypes
and we're ready
to introduce our technology
to a world that needs to see
our product.
So...
who's ready to strike a deal,
raise a toast,
and get liddup?
(both, high-pitched voice)
because it's awesome!
(laughs)
So why would we ever
get in business
with rude and selfish
individuals like you?
I'm talking about two guys who
just opened a cooler of beer...
beer and didn't share
anything with anybody.
And didn't offer it to anybody.
Oh, shoot!
Yes. Sorry about that.
(Daymond) How about that?
That is very rude.
(Lori and Robert laugh)
(Taylor) Who would like one?
Why, I would.
(Robert) Sure. I'll have one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah, bro. Thanks.
Salud to the shark tank.
(clinking)
Cheers, Kevin.
We already got something
out of the deal.
Whoo!
Now, Taylor and Jayson,
when I heard Daymond
call you greedy,
I thought
he was talking about
the valuation
you put on your business.
Oh, that's next.
Because you've asked me
for $100,000 for 10%,
implying that this is worth
a million dollars.
Defend yourselves
before I drink your beers.
So we have designed
and developed
a revolutionary product
for a very large, $500-Million
gross sales industry.
We feel that our product's worth
a million dollars
and we're looking for
a strong strategic partner
to help us take it to market.
But why do you feel
it's worth a million dollars?
(Daymond)
Those words all just meant
that
"I don't have any sales."
Correct?
Correct.
(Robert) So, Jayson, you never
answered the question.
How is it worth
a million dollars?
We had to start somewhere,
so that's where we started at.
(sharks laugh)
Awesome! Awesome!
(Taylor) Yeah.
You know, most honest--
Not good,
but most honest answer ever.
Well, we appreciate that.
We're honest guys, so...
(sharks laugh)
Have you shown it to any buyers
in the large box stores
that sell all of the coolers?
Uh, we have not shown it
to any retailers yet,
uh, and that's on purpose.
We've been waiting to develop
our intellectual property
to help secure our technology
and to protect us.
What is the intellectual
property in this? Like...
(laughs)
Do you have a patent
or is one pending?
We actually have
three issued patents.
Our patents cover the interior,
uh, L.E.D. Lighting.
And no one can put an L.E.D.
Anywhere inside a cooler
except you two dudes?
Correct.
I have some potentially bad news
for you.
I think there's only a couple
of people that make coolers,
and they own most of the market.
Am I right?
Yes.
Yes, 100% correct.
There's three manufacturers,
right?
(mouths word)
And therein lies your problem,
because it's a zero-sum game.
Either you're gonna get them
to play ball with you
and light it up with you,
or it's almost gonna be
impossible to get shelf space
unless you spend
an obscene amount of money.
Have you approached them?
Uh, that's the reason
why we're here,
is we have not because--
Because we were securing
our intellectual property
and protecting ourselves.
You agree the right strategy is
not to build your own coolers?
It's to go to one of
the three guys,
with a patent that's protected,
and create a license opportunity
where you get paid--
a few dollars if you're lucky,
a few cents if you're not--
for every single cooler
with lights.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
Yes, sir.
Now that is interesting.
But technically,
why do you need us then?
Because all roads lead to
Mr. Wonderful
when it comes to
negotiating a license deal.
(both laugh)
We know that.
(all laugh)
Taylor and Jayson,
you're asking $100,000 for 10%--
It means a million dollars.
And I, you know,
when I see numbers like that,
you know what I'm gonna say.
I know a guy in the Hood
that will follow you around...
with a flashlight.
With a flashlight
and show you your beer
for the rest of your life
for a million dollars.
(Lori laughs)
I'm out.
Okay.
Daymond's got
half the Hood employed now.
(all laugh)
I think it's interesting.
I'm not sure how big a need
there is for it.
Anybody could really buy
a tap light
and put it in their cooler.
Correct.
That's correct.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
(Robert) So, guys,
here's the good news.
One of my best Friends is one of
the largest makers of tents
and accessories for them.
So he knows that market
inside out,
and we've done
a bunch of deals together.
So I can set up a meeting
with the largest manufacturer
of coolers in the world
very easily.
I'll give you the $100,000...
for 25% of the company,
and we'll see what happens
at the meeting.
I'll tell you what, guys.
I love the beer. Thank you.
I'm out. Say "Yes" Before
he changes his mind.
All right, the problem
with Robert's offer is...
there's no problem
with Robert's offer.
There's only one potential
there--his friend.
It won't work
unless you have two bids.
Because what you want to create
is the potential of this market
in their minds.
If there are two bidders,
the advance is huge.
If there's one,
you get nothing.
This is what uncle Kevin knows,
and this is where he brings
the big value.
Only an idiot would
walk into a meeting
and give the impression
that there isn't other players
in the market.
The way you get maximum value
is by creating a position
with the first guy
so that they feel
a certain amount of pressure
so you don't
walk across the street.
Robert's wrong because you are
working an oligopoly.
There are 3 companies
that own over 80% share.
Have you even made an offer?
I'm trying to,
but you keep interrupting me.
I'm gonna make it easy. I'm not
gonna ask for any equity at all.
I'll give you the $100,000
for one-Third, 33%,
of whatever we get to license it
from a cooler manufacturer,
whichever one it is.
But I'm there by your side
negotiating it,
hockey sticking it,
soccer balling it,
race driving it
along with you.
Guys, he's just blowing smoke.
We're all good at negotiating
up here.
I like to depend on people
who've been in the business.
Kevin negotiates
from a point of aggression.
I'm happy to walk in
with my friend,
who's been doing business
with these guys for 20 years.
And they'll be honest with you
and tell you whether
there's a deal here or not.
Can we consult
for just a minute?
Absolutely.
Hey, guys, I'll make it
really easy.
If that offer's attractive
for you, go for it.
I'm out.
(Daymond) whoa!
You got one offer left
on the table.
Let's do business, Kevin.
(claps hands)
(chuckles)
I'm very excited, gentlemen.
I'm gonna drink a beer
in your honor.
Kevin, you just got lit up
by liddup.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
It's great.
Let's get started.
It's very interesting.
(high-Pitched voice)
what?
(Robert)
Hey, I wasn't listening.
Did you take
their royalties forever
and their firstborn?
Uh, left the firstborn out.
(laughs)
gosh! I can't believe it.
All this time--
We got a deal with Kevin.
That's who we wanted
to get a deal with.
All this time,
all this hard work...
ohh. It feels great.
It feels absolutely awesome.
We can't wait
to light up the world.
