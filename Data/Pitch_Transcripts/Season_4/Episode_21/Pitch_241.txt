My name is Colin Grussing.
I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana.
Hi, my name is Colin Grussing,
Well, Colin...
okay. Okay.
I'll--I'll tell you, too.
I think they're very cool.
I really like them.
But I do think you have
a competition problem.
I-I can't see you
protecting this in any way
(Robert) So, Colin,
it's an interesting position.
Three sharks are out.
One has made an offer.
Which is--
The last one is saying
"I'm not telling you
want I'm gonna do
until you tell me what
the other guy's doing."
I think...
what do you do?
That what I--the people
I would love
to work with the most
would be you two.
I think you should throw in
$100,000, too.
(Daymond) but I'm not gonna work
with him.
but Colin may have
jeopardized the deal
by waiting for Mark.
Um, do you--
(Lori) This is
your defining moment.
You know, I've said this
to people before,
Lori, stop. Colin,
I-I like you. I'm out.
Oh.
(Mark) what?
(Kevin) wow.
I was on the fence,
but I'm out.
What happened there,
Daymond?
He's taking too long.
I know that I would've had to
put in a large amount of work.
I don't like
an indecisive person.
Colin,
bone-In-mouth disease.
(mark laughs)
You--You were exactly right.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's a shame.
