My name is Colin Grussing.
I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana.
Hi, my name is Colin Grussing,
and my business is rootsuit.
I'm here seeking
a $100,000 investment
for 15% of my company.
I could describe the product
to you,
but I think it's probably better
to just show you.
(blows whistle)
Well, Colin...
okay. Okay.
I'll--I'll tell you, too.
I think they're very cool.
I really like them.
But I do think you have
a competition problem.
I-I can't see you
protecting this in any way
and I can see a lot of other
people making it.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Let me speak to that...
(laughs) Before--Before--
Before you all think that
that's a huge problem.
I mean, lots--Lots of
businesses have competition.
And the way that they do it--
I'm talking to you now--
Um, is through branding...
Yeah.
You know? I mean,
how many people came in after
you started what you started
and make--Make
very similar things,
but people kept buying yours
because you were able
to brand it.
Correct.
(Kevin)
I like to put money into things
that get really big
so I get much richer.
Yeah.
That's sort of my strategy.
I-I don't know how this is
going to turn into
a $50-Million
squeeze-a-guy-in-a-suit
business.
For me as an investment,
it ain't there. I'm out.
You are making money.
We're making
a lot of money.
But the only way that it's
of value to me is
to own a good portion
of the company, number one.
Number two, we know
it can go to retail.
I'm gonna have to give you
an offer
that's gonna be
a very sharky offer.
I'll give you, uh,
the $100,000 for 50%.
(chuckles)
okay. I-I really appreciate
the offer.
That--I'm doing numbers
in my head.
Is there a contingency
on that?
Contingency is that
we have to get it into retail.
Get it into retail.
I love--
(Robert) wow.
'cause then I know my work
starts at that point.
Well, you got an offer.
I love--Let me say,
I love that contingency
and I would--
there's no one in the world
I would rather do that with
than you. (chuckles)
Um...
that's great. Um...
You may want to hear
from Mr. Cuban first.
He's been known to do
really crazy things.
I want to hear what you say
to his offer first.
Okay. Well, I'm... sorry.
Can I...
I got really excited.
I'd like to take a second
to think about this.
(mark laughs)
You don't seem really excited.
Yeah, he does.
Yeah, he does.
He's like... (flat voice)
"Yeah, ah, that's great."
(Robert) So, Colin,
it's an interesting position.
Three sharks are out.
One has made an offer.
Which is--
The last one is saying
"I'm not telling you
want I'm gonna do
until you tell me what
the other guy's doing."
I think...
what do you do?
That what I--the people
I would love
to work with the most
would be you two.
I think you should throw in
$100,000, too.
(Daymond) but I'm not gonna work
with him.
(laughs) And own 100%
of the company?
No, no, no. Let's keep it--
Let's keep it at 50%.
(sharks laugh)
I-I'm--I'm not
gonna work with mark.
I really--
Okay.
You should
maybe entertain mark,
because I'm on the fence.
I may actually
take that offer back.
(Kevin) Often this happens.
A dog has a bone in its jaws.
It gets to a bridge.
(speaks indistinctly)
It looks down. It sees
the reflection of another bone.
Opens its mouth
to get that one,
and "Oh, no.
The first bone's gone!"
(mark laughs)
I mean, there is--
There is--
I think you've got a bone
in your mouth right now...
okay.
And you don't want
to get boned,
so you better think
a little bit about this.
but Colin may have
jeopardized the deal
by waiting for Mark.
Um, do you--
(Lori) This is
your defining moment.
You know, I've said this
to people before,
and I've watched it happen
so many times--
Lori, stop. Colin,
I-I like you. I'm out.
Oh.
(Mark) what?
(Kevin) wow.
I was on the fence,
but I'm out.
What happened there,
Daymond?
He's taking too long.
I know that I would've had to
put in a large amount of work.
I don't like
an indecisive person.
Colin,
bone-In-mouth disease.
(mark laughs)
You--You were exactly right.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's a shame.
And now there's one.
(Mark) Look...
hi, man.
I think you're smart.
I love the business.
You're gonna keep on growing.
You're doing
all the right things.
You're gonna make
a boatload of money off of this.
You want to do some of that?
Bu the issue is,
you'd be an idiot
to take a partner,
because you're good,
right?
There's just some businesses
that are better off
being owned
by the entrepreneur
and just going out there
and kicking ass,
and that's you.
What are you saying, mark?
You in, you out?
I'm out.
But I'm rooting for you...
well--
because you're gonna be great.
Well, thank you so much
for your time.
I really appreciate
the advice and everything.
I think you're gonna do Well.
Yeah, yeah, I do, too.
You've already done well.
You'll continue to grow.
Okay, thanks so much.
(Lori) Good luck.
He's like a superhero
when he puts that suit on.
(Lori laughs)
(Kevin) Maybe there's
a lesson in that.
Maybe you come in here--
You gotta be fast
and you'll be made an offer.
Gotta be decisive.
No, I think the lesson is,
put a bone in Kevin's mouth
and see where he drops it.
(laughs) I don't have
bone-In-mouth disease.
(laughs)
