Hi. I'm Dave Alwan
of Echo Valley meats
from Peoria, Illinois,
the heart of the midwest.
I am seeking $300,000
for 20% equity.
Echo valley meats makes
the best meat you'll ever eat.
We specialize
in that old-fashioned
Butcher shop quality
and deliver
the most delicious meats
from the farm
to tables nationwide.
This business is in my blood.
I'm third generation
in the meat business,
a cattleman and a farmer.
My motto is simple--
Know the meat business
from conception to consumption,
and I know this business
better than anyone.
I'd love for your family,
friends, and clients
to say "Wow!" When they receive
a gift from ECHO valley meats.
I assure that partnering
with one of you
for creative vision,
connections, and knowledge
of the e-Commerce
will help take Echo valley meats
to the next level of success.
You're the sharks,
and now it's time
for a feeding frenzy.
(Lori and Robert laugh)
Ladies first.
(Robert) Oh, wow.
(Lori) Thank you. Wow.
Robert.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I love cold cuts.
(Mark) Thank you, sir.
(Dave) Now I can
assure you...
(Robert) Whoa.
Whoa.
Making money
never tasted so good.
Wow. David, can you tell us
what we were eating? What--
Sure. Uh, the one
on your plate, Robert,
to the far--
Your left hand there,
that would be
a beef tenderloin.
That would be--
Very good.
Good.
Um, the other one would be
our hickory smoked
beef brisket,
which we slow-roast for
about 15 to 16 hours ourselves.
That was outstanding.
Um, the other one
is our ham,
which is a-a-again,
a natural juice ham,
so there's no water added
to it.
And what was this?
That is our summer sausage.
That is an award-winning
summer sausage as well.
Fantastic.
Tell us about
the--the business side of it.
Uh, last year,
we did $1.25 million...
(Kevin and Lori) Whoa.
Between retail, catering,
and our mail order.
So when you say retail,
what does that mean?
I have a retail in Peoria.
You have a retail store?
Yes, in Peoria.
Oh. Okay.
How do customers find you?
Right now, it's literally,
uh, word of mouth.
I have been developing this
for the past ten years,
literally guerilla marketing.
I get in my car and take samples
to local businesses
around Peoria--
$25 gift boxes,
$50 gift boxes--
and drop 'em off to corporations
and say, "This is what we do."
Dave, how does
the price point compare
to the other competitors,
and the quality?
42% cheaper than pretty much
anybody in the industry.
I have stuck to the basics,
believe in the best product.
I knew it was gonna take me
a lot longer
to get to where I wanted to go,
but I've stuck to my roots.
So if you're offering, uh,
the same quality
or a better quality Product
for cheaper,
what are you margins
on your products?
Um,
on the mail-Order business,
at the end of the day
on any of these items,
we net about 26% to 28%
across the board.
This particular ham here,
which is about an 8- To
10-Pound spiral-Sliced ham,
would retail in the catalog
for $49.
That ham cost me between
$16 and $18 before packaging.
Are you trying to go
into other retail outlets?
No, I'd like to go into
more mail order than retail.
You wanna go straight direct.
That's right.
What did you make
on that $1.25 million in Sales?
Uh, we only netted
about $20,000.
Is that after
you paid yourself something?
Yes.
David, on $1.25 million in
sales, you basically broke even.
That's what happened.
That's correct.
So--
(Robert) Why, David?
I paid for everything
as I went.
Um, I have--all of my equipment
is paid for in full.
Um, my smokehouse Alone
would cost
a quarter-Million dollars
to pay for,
my sausage Stuffer's $150,000,
if you were gonna
buy this stuff brand-new.
Everything's paid for
in full.
But, Dave, if I take out
the one-time cost
of the equipment...
Let's say you did
$1.2 million next year
and got rid
of those one-Time costs.
How much money
would you have made?
Um...
probably closer to $50,000.
(Robert) Why is the profit
so low?
You know, when you're making
that little bit of money,
one little thing goes wrong,
and...
from this point forward,
once we go over
the $3-Million mark,
everything becomes profit.
Our overhead doesn't change
one bit. Um...
so you have a cost structure
that you've gotta do a certain
amount just to break even.
That's right. 1.2
is basically our break-Even,
and that's where we're at
right now.
So I give you the $300,000.
What do you spend it on?
Um, I would think
purely marketing
and bringing in product
inventory before the season.
But what type of marketing?
There's...
uh, national e-commerce.
I think that's where the growth
is, really, is e-commerce.
The problem with that,
David, is,
do you know what it cost you
to acquire a new customer?
Um, not really,
to be honest with you.
We've been developing this,
recreating the Web site,
just really fine-Tuning
last multiple years
to get to where we're at now.
But you wanna take my $300,000
to experiment
to find those answers.
I don't know what
it's gonna cost
to get a customer that comes
back every holiday to buy a ham.
You don't, either.
You're gonna go find out.
You're gonna spend
my $300,000 doing it.
Maybe you'll be successful,
maybe you won't be
because--
I know a--I know a customer
that ordered $1,400
only ordered $900 last year.
So I-I feel
in the past several years
I have not lost any business.
Each customer has came back
and continued to grow with us.
Dave, I don't--I don't think
that there's any doubt
This is a fantastic product.
The meat was great.
(Kevin) No, but I think
what we'll find out, Dave,
is the reason
they're $79 on your $49 ham
is that their cost of customer
acquisition is the difference.
And you'd find that out. You're
not gonna be any different.
It's gonna cost money,
maybe $20 more per order.
If we would get to
a $5-Million point
on our mail-Order business
alone and net 28%,
for $300,000, you would have
100% return on Investment back
within basically--
Yeah, but that's--That's--
(Robert) Yeah, but you're not--
You're not telling us--
That--That's a long road
from here to there.
Dave, here's where you
screwed up, all right?
You know the meat business.
You make a great product.
You proved it.
But what you've told us is,
your retail business
is your retail business.
You see the upside,
because the margins are greater,
in the direct mail business,
particularly through e-commerce.
The one thing you didn't do
was come prepared
to explain to us why.
You're coming in unprepared.
That doesn't cut it.
I'm out.
Okay.
(Robert)
You're making the assumption
people are gonna buy
your product and stay with you,
but you're not answering
the question--
How much it's gonna cost
to find that customer.
Yeah.
I think you came up
with $300,000.
I asked you, how are you gonna
specifically spend that,
and you say marketing,
national marketing.
And maybe it's sending out
samples like I did, you know,
in my car--
Oh, whoa, Dave.
You never wanna talk
about "Maybe."
Yeah.
You know,
I-I grew up on a farm.
Right, you know, a farmer
doesn't go out in the field
and throw a bunch of seeds out
and says,
"Gee, I hope there's corn
next year."
(chuckles)
Yeah. True.
That's what you're doing.
True.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay.
But I will take more sausage.
(Lori and Robert laugh)
there's plenty of that.
Can't call
your business plan bad
because there isn't one.
It's kind of an interesting
problem you have here, Dave.
The product is
absolutely spectacular.
Thank you.
And the strategy to get it
into the market isn't there,
at least,
in terms of e-commerce.
I don't see the opportunity
'cause you didn't present it
to me. I'm out.
Okay.
Daymond or Lori?
You probably can't tell it,
but I-I generally try not
to eat red meat. I eat fish.
Um, I'm trying not to go
in that area of business.
Um, you know, my kids are vegans
and things of that nature.
So from just
that standpoint alone,
I'm out.
And, Lori?
I really like you...
thank you.
And I think the product
is amazing.
I have a lot of experience
with catalog sales.
And it is hard
to get your name known,
and you do have
a lot of competition.
I think that you'll make it,
slowly.
But I like to get things
out there really quickly
to get my return
on my investment,
and I don't see that
happening here.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Good luck, David.
Well, thank you, guys.
Have a great day.
(Mark) Thank you.
(Lori) Good luck.
You know, it's amazing.
If he wasn't
as nice as he was...
think about it.
He came out here with no plan.
(Daymond and Lori laugh)
(Robert) We've--We've shredded
people with that same thing,
But the guy was
just a nice guy.
Yeah, and he gave us--
And he fed you.
He gave us
a good piece of steak.
You know, sometimes it's good
to feed the sharks. (chuckles)
(Daymond) Yeah.
