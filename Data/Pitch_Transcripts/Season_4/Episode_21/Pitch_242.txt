Hi. I'm Dave Alwan
of Echo Valley meats
from Peoria, Illinois,
the heart of the midwest.
I am seeking $300,000
for 20% equity.
Echo valley meats makes
the best meat you'll ever eat.
We specialize
in that old-fashioned
Butcher shop quality
(Dave) Now I can
assure you...
(Robert) Whoa.
Whoa.
Making money
never tasted so good.
Wow. David, can you tell us
what we were eating? What--
Sure. Uh, the one
on your plate, Robert,
Dave, how does
the price point compare
But, Dave, if I take out
the one-time cost
of the equipment...
Let's say you did
$1.2 million next year
Dave, I don't--I don't think
that there's any doubt
This is a fantastic product.
The meat was great.
(Kevin) No, but I think
what we'll find out, Dave,
is the reason
they're $79 on your $49 ham
is that their cost of customer
acquisition is the difference.
Dave, here's where you
screwed up, all right?
You know the meat business.
You make a great product.
You proved it.
But what you've told us is,
your retail business
is your retail business.
You see the upside,
because the margins are greater,
in the direct mail business,
particularly through e-commerce.
The one thing you didn't do
was come prepared
to explain to us why.
You're coming in unprepared.
That doesn't cut it.
I'm out.
Okay.
(Robert)
You're making the assumption
in my car--
Oh, whoa, Dave.
You never wanna talk
about "Maybe."
Yeah.
You know,
I-I grew up on a farm.
Right, you know, a farmer
doesn't go out in the field
It's kind of an interesting
problem you have here, Dave.
The product is
absolutely spectacular.
Thank you.
