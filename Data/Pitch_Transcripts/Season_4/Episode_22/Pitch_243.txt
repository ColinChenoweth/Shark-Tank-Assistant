Tracey:
My name's Tracey Noonan,
and this is my daughter
Danielle.
We're from Cohasset,
Massachusetts.
Danielle: And our company
is Wicked Good Cupcakes.
We're from Boston, and
everything's wicked pissa here.
[ both laugh ]
our cupcakes are baked fresh
daily from scratch.
No boxes or mixes
are ever used.
I am head baker,
and she is head decorator.
You need any help
with Anything?
Tracey: Danielle and I
have always been very close.
We make all our decisions
together.
[ scoffs ]
No. No, we don't.
She makes most of
the decisions all the time.
Mom, the red velvets
are done.
We're at a point where
our company is growing too fast
for us to keep up,
and we actually have a new twist
on how to share our wicked good
cupcakes with the nation.
Oh, this was
only half a dozen?
Yeah.
Are you worried the sharks
won't understand our accent?
No, I'm not worried
they won't understand us.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Tracey Noonan,
and this is my daughter
Danielle.
We own and operate
Wicked Good Cupcakes.
We're here today
seeking $75,000
in return for a 20% equity
in our company.
Two years ago,
buttercup moved out.
As a mom,
I was heartbroken.
I decided we should take
cake-decorating classes
as a way to spend some time
together.
Well, before we knew it,
in October 2011,
Wicked Good Cupcakes
was born.
We received tons of requests
to ship our cupcakes nationwide.
It was a big challenge, though,
trying to figure out
how to keep them fresh
and intact,
and that's when we came up
with the idea
of shipping them
in a jar.
Our cupcake jars
are baked fresh daily.
We layer them with homemade
frosting and filling,
ship them in gift boxes
with spoons
so they're ready to eat
right out of the package.
Basically, they appeal
to anyone with a mouth.
[ laughter ]
We're not afraid
to work hard.
Our days right now average 13
to 14 hours, plus.
Mom's definitely getting
her fair share of time with me.
So, which of you sharks
will be the first
to sink your choppers
into our sweet deal?
It's definitely a risk
worth taking.
We found that there's a lot
of dough to be made from batter.
[ laughter ]
BOTH: Thank you.
We got to try it.
We got to try it.
We actually have some
for you to try.
They're wicked good.
Danielle: They also have
a much better shelf life
thanks to the jars.
[ laughs ]
Harrington:
Can I have a "Jah"?
is that -- "Jah"?
jar.
I love your accent.
O'Leary:
Where are you from?
Boston.
The middle one's
for you.
Thank you.
No problem.
Cookies and cream
is for you.
Oh, my God.
This is so good.
Thank you, buttercup.
[ laughs ]
Well, ladies, let me say,
welcome to the shark tank...
thank you.
...from a fellow Bostonian.
I live on Marlborough Street.
Oh, I love
Marlborough Street!
That is one damn good jar
of cake.
It's the bomb, literally.
Unbelievable. Look at this.
It's gone already.
Here's another jar
for you, Mark.
[ laughter ]
You're killing me.
How many have you sold
so far, Tracey?
From January
of this year,
we've sold $73,000
worth of jars.
Our cupcake shop
has sold $150,000,
including the $73,000
of the jars.
So you have a store.
We have a retail storefront,
as well, since october 2011.
Are we being asked to invest
in the retail store
and the jar cupcake company?
We're actually offering
a piece of both...
let me try yours.
...the retail shop
as well as the jars.
No.
Basically,
our sales right now
for this year
are slated to be $360,000.
The growth potential that
we have discovered with these
is phenomenal.
Tracey, it's not patented.
Someone else
can put a cake in a jar
and ship it
across the country.
Absolutely,
they could.
So tell me
what your plan is.
How are you going to grow
this business quickly
so that if I give you $75,000,
I get richer?
That's all I care about.
We want to be the Ben &amp; Jerry's
of cupcakes in a jar.
How many days
is the shelf life of a jar?
Seven to 10.
Seven to 10.
So you've got bake it
and sell it right away
and ship it,
'cause it's gonna be
two days
before It's
in somebody's mouth, right?
Correct.
Have you talked to anybody
about extending the shelf life?
'cause I know
it's something you can do.
Yeah -- with preservatives.
You know, we --
if you put preservatives in,
does it taste this wonderful?
That's the exactly
the question --
Will it alter the taste?
What does each one cost to make,
and what do you sell them for?
The 8-Ounce jars
cost $2.15 to make.
We retail that
for $5.95.
The 16-Ounce jar
costs $3 to make,
and we retail that
for $8.95.
O'Leary: This product
will never be in retail.
It's always going to be
an online.
Somebody buys it, you bake it,
you send it overnight to them.
Actually, we do have
some wholesale clients.
We have a Coffee Company
up in Massachusetts.
What are you charging her
a jar?
We're charging her
$3 a jar.
It's not enough margin
for you.
Okay,
but here's the thing --
We're buying in such
pathetic bulk right now.
Okay, Tracey,
your best-case scenario --
I give you
the $75,000.
Yep.
Tell me
what your margins will be.
Sure.
Right now it costs you $2.15
to make the small one
and $3 for the big one.
Right.
How much can you reduce
the cost?
I believe we can get
the smaller jars down to $1.45.
The question I have is --
On the Mason jars,
are there any alternatives
that would allow you
to reduce your costs
considerably?
I got to say the Mason jars are
a really big draw for people.
O'Leary: Exactly.
Greiner: You can see it.
It's motherhood
and apple pie.
Exactly.
It's a homemade product
in a crafty container.
Right.
It suggests homemade, right?
Exactly, and people
do say that to us.
I don't think there's anything
wrong with your packaging.
I just think you might need
a better supplier
for the jar itself.
Maybe you're not buying
at a big enough bulk.
We need more money to buy
in bigger bulk -- Bottom line.
That's why we're here.
Tracey, as you can tell,
I'm not a big dessert guy, so...
you can pass yours
down this way.
I know. This is really good.
It's carrot cake.
Pass that to Mark.
There's definitely
a novelty aspect to it,
because I've never heard of
a cupcake in a jar.
So I think you can sell
some of those.
How did you
like the product?
It's too sweet for me.
But I have concerns with
the retail and jar aspect of it,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay. Well, thank you.
Danielle: Thank you.
Robert's not
a big dessert eater.
I am, and if I invest
in this company,
I'll be a bigger and bigger
and bigger desert eater.
[ laughter ]
and I'm afraid,
because I love the product.
Well, we work there,
and we look pretty good.
We'll limit you.
I won't look the same.
Trust me.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.
You know,
I have now tried three.
They are fantastic.
They are wicked good.
The problem is it's just not
going to have a long shelf life,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Cupcakes are super-Scorching
hot right now,
and there's just so many people
going into this space.
That's not really
where my specialty is,
and I think you guys
are gonna do great things.
But it's really not a fit
for me, so I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.
Come on, Mr. Wonderful.
[ laughs ]
I'm gonna make you an offer.
You may not like it.
I love the product.
I hate the margins.
I'll give you the $75,000.
I don't want any equity.
I want $1
from every jar.
Oh.
A dollar?
Silence, please.
Let me get the offer out.
I want $1 from every jar
until I get my $75,000 back,
which means you have to sell
75,000 jars, all right?
And then I want it to drop
to 50 cents in perpetuity.
Whew.
And you decide
what to do with the business.
Can we just scoot out
in the hall for one second?
Trust me. You're not gonna get a
worse offer than that.
So you probably
should talk.
Thank you.
We'll be right back.
Thank you.
All right.
Harrington: How much money
does that leave them with
if they give you a dollar?
Practically nothing.
[ laughter ]
Think of
what you're doing, Kevin.
Hey, listen.
This will give them incentive
to figure
their margin problem out.
[ laughs ]
I like my deal,
and I'll sleep tonight
with a cupcake beside me.
[ laughter ]
All right.
So, Tracey, Danielle,
welcome back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Four sharks were out, and
Mr. Wonderful made you an offer.
He's giving you the $75,000,
but he wants no equity.
He wants $1
off every cupcake jar
until he gets paid back,
and then 50 cents
from there on in
until you can't bake
any more.
[ chuckles ]
Don't do a deal that could
cripple your business.
Greiner:
I agree with him.
Don't do something
that you'll regret afterwards.
Oh, Tracey,
talk is so cheap.
Okay, we'd like
to come back to you
with 40 cents a jar
in perpetuity.
Damn.
45 cents, you have a deal.
Come to mama.
[ laughter ]
[ groans ]
Oh, my goodness.
That's great.
Thank you.
Harrington: Wow.
O'Leary:
That's wonderful,
and the product
really is fantastic.
Get baking.
Good luck.
Congratulations.
It was nice
meeting you.
Bye.
I'm gonna be very happy.
Mr. Wonderful
will see his return
sooner than he thinks,
and we're just gonna do great.

new product.
