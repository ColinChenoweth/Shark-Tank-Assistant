Tracey:
My name's Tracey Noonan,
I'm Tracey Noonan,
Danielle: They also have
a much better shelf life
thanks to the jars.
[ laughs ]
Harrington:
Can I have a "Jah"?
is that -- "Jah"?
jar.
I love your accent.
O'Leary:
Where are you from?
Boston.
The middle one's
for you.
Thank you.
No problem.
How many have you sold
so far, Tracey?
From January
of this year,
we've sold $73,000
worth of jars.
Our cupcake shop
has sold $150,000,
including the $73,000
of the jars.
So you have a store.
We have a retail storefront,
as well, since october 2011.
Are we being asked to invest
in the retail store
Tracey, it's not patented.
Someone else
can put a cake in a jar
Okay, Tracey,
your best-case scenario --
I give you
the $75,000.
Yep.
Tell me
what your margins will be.
Sure.
Right now it costs you $2.15
to make the small one
Tracey, as you can tell,
I'm not a big dessert guy, so...
you can pass yours
down this way.
I know. This is really good.
It's carrot cake.
Pass that to Mark.
There's definitely
a novelty aspect to it,
because I've never heard of
a cupcake in a jar.
So I think you can sell
some of those.
How did you
like the product?
It's too sweet for me.
Okay. Well, thank you.
Danielle: Thank you.
Robert's not
a big dessert eater.
So, Tracey, Danielle,
welcome back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, Tracey,
talk is so cheap.
Okay, we'd like
to come back to you
with 40 cents a jar
in perpetuity.
Damn.
45 cents, you have a deal.
Come to mama.
[ laughter ]
[ groans ]
Oh, my goodness.
That's great.
Thank you.
Harrington: Wow.
O'Leary:
That's wonderful,
