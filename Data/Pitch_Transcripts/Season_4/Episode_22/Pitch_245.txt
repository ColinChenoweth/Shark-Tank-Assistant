Hi, sharks.
I'm Nate Holdsaffle.
And I'm founder
of the Mission Belt Company,
and we're seeking $50,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in our company.
Everyone owns a belt --
Most people own a few --
and in a thousand years,
this everyday accessory
Has hardly ever changed.
And some people might ask,
"Why reinvent the wheel?"
at the mission belt company,
we've asked, "Why not?"
so we set on a mission to
improve this everyday accessory.
For starters...
careful.
...we removed all the holes.
We've also employed
our unique ratchet system
to allow it to go together.
You can hear the clicks
as it goes together, feeds...
[ clicking ]
...slowly,
and use the release lever
on the bottom to take it apart.
It's like a giant zip tie
for your pants.
Now, sharks,
I'm a big, husky guy,
and keeping my pants on
is a full-time job, okay?
[ laughter ]
I wear out so many belts.
I wear all kinds of belts.
It is for Kevin, also.
[ laughter ]
Okay, O'Leary, we got something
in common. That's good.
Keeping up my pants
is a full-time job
because I wear them out so quick
and the holes
are what cause the problem.
Regardless of my caloric intake,
the mission belt's gonna give me
the perfect fit every time,
and it's gonna last a long time.
Sharks, with your help,
I believe I could put
one of these belts
around the waist
of everyone in America.
Let's make a deal.
Is that all it does
is ratchet on?
Yep.
Can we see them?
Sure.
Harrington:
Thank you.
Oh, it's well made.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's very well made.
Do you manufacture
these, Nate?
I sure do.
Yourself, or do you --
No, I actually employ
a factory to do it.
This is as high a quality belt
as I could make
and still make it
comfortable price.
But nobody can make a belt
just like the mission belt.
Our unique style, our design,
and frankly, the quality
and the effort we put together
to make these belts
is unique and special.
What's the distribution
plan?
How are you gonna get this
in every store
where Men's and Women's clothes
are sold?
That's exactly my biggest Hurdle
that I'm gonna have.
I need a rolodex.
I'm a good salesman,
but I can't get in front
of the right people.
Tell us about the stores
you're selling in right now.
They're small, local retailers.
I'm in a couple
of country clubs,
a couple
of men's clothier places,
and really,
it's the number-one-selling belt
in each of these locations.
What are they
reordering?
Is it because they're selling
three a week or 20 or 30
or you're really
doing well?
The orders are going up.
I have one location
that sells 250 a month.
250 belts a month?
Greiner: A month?
In one location out of those 22.
What does it sell for?
35 bucks.
How much have you made
last year?
We've only been in business
for three months.
How much have you sold?
$39,000 worth of product.
In three months?
Yep.
Pretty darn good
for belts.
John:
That is really Good.
Wow.
What's it cost to make them,
and what are you wholesaling
them for?
Right now, even in the small
quantities I'm building them,
I can build them for anywhere
from about $5.50 to $6,
shipped here in the U.S.
With a tag.
And what's your wholesale?
$15.
$15?
Mm-hmm.
Margins are okay.
Margins are good.
The biggest challenge
is the demonstration of that.
If it's just hanging there,
we have no idea what it was.
We were all looking at it,
and you don't
hear the ratcheting.
You don't understand it.
How do I walk into a store,
see that display,
see mission belt --
How do I know it does that?
What I've gone ahead and done
in these 22 locations
is I've taken
some Real personal effort
and I've gone to each one
of them,
and I pay attention
to the salespeople.
"Hi. How are you?
My name's nate."
"And Here's a belt."
"Here's a belt.
You want to try one on?"
I have every salesperson
who sells them wear them.
The reality of it is, once you
wear one of these belts,
it's really hard to consider
anything else for the pants,
because it adjusts
to every quarter-Inch.
A lot of belts, it's like
it fits and then it doesn't.
Especially for big guys.
I weigh 250, man.
You don't want to buy
a 42-Inch.
I lost 10 pounds
last week,
and I might gain 10 pounds
tomorrow
because I'm in l.A.
And I love food.
[ laughter ]
the reality of it is
that my belt will fit.
And it always broadcasts
to the world
how much weight you've gained
or lost or whatever.
This belt doesn't show any wear.
When I decided I wanted
to try to sell these,
I thought,
"I'm gonna do a test market."
And I went out
to a local swap meet.
I took 100 belts with me.
Two hours later,
the belts were gone,
and I knew
at that point right there
that I had something unique
and special.
I sold some Belts door-To-Door
here in west hollywood.
I want to say
it was saturday night.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You came to L.A.
And one of
the first things you did
when you get
to Los Angeles --
I check in,
got nothing else to do,
evening to myself.
I went and sold 20 belts
door-to-door.
I love you.
I love you!
Are their any other ones
like this?
There are.
There are?
Holdsaffle: Yeah, there's
products that are like it.
It's called a t-Belt.
But, Lori,
they don't ratchet like this.
No, they don't ratchet,
which is why I'm saying --
the t-Belt's where
they just get snug, right?
John:
Yeah, the army ones.
But they never work properly
over time.
They sure don't,
and lot of times, too,
a nylon belt's really cool,
but I wouldn't wear a nylon belt
with anything you're wearing.
I think it's very tough
to actually get distribution
of just five
or six belts.
But with the right person
as a partner,
with the right rolodex --
I'm not asking anyone
to sell this belt for me.
We don't need to hire
a sales force.
I am a sales force.
We can go out and do this.
I love him.
What I need is to get
the appointments.
With the right names
and the right references,
I can get in front
of these places.
Right now I bat 1.000.
Everybody who I pitch the belt
to who can make a decision buys.
I think you're great.
You're a hero.
It's very innovative.
I like it a lot.
And I think that men could use
a product like this.
The only problem
is I see this product
as something that really
needs to be demonstrated,
and I think it would be
difficult to show it in,
let's say, jcpenney
in 1,000-Plus stores.
You're not gonna get
the sales force
to be able to talk about it
enough,
because there's hundreds
of products per floor.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
No problem. Thank you very much
for your opinion.
I appreciate it.
I like the product.
I think this is
a big distribution play.
I think it will sell
wherever it goes.
Getting it into the stores is
gonna be a significant challenge
that I'm not up for,
but I will buy one from you.
I like the product a lot.
I'm gonna use it.
But I'm out.
Is there a problem at all
if someone's really skinny
where there's just
too much belt hanging over?
No.
I know you don't have
that problem.
I don't have that problem,
but there are some.
It's actually a cool feature.
My son Lorenzo
is 4 1/2 years old.
He's a little guy.
He's skinny.
And he wanted a mission belt.
You take the belts off.
The Buckles
are totally interchangeable.
But how do you
make it smaller?
Cut it down.
I guess it doesn't matter.
The ends don't matter, right?
Sure. You can make it
as small as you want.
But if you're in a men's store,
if you're thin,
you're not gonna
want to cut a belt.
We have different sizes,
though.
We have small, medium, large,
and extra large right now.
You know, for me,
it's a pure licensing play.
And I'm open to licensing.
I'm not a person
who has an agenda.
I want to get things done.
I want to make things work.
The thing about it
is that in the end of the day,
it's not just $50,000.
I do need that rolodex,
and I need financial depth.
Well, I think everybody here
can give you the rolodex.
Everybody here can give you
the financial depth,
but I think if you want to sell
belts to other stores,
I'm probably
not your partner.
I'm out.
How much did you say
you invested?
Right now,
we're about $90,000.
You don't have any debt,
no big credit cards backed up?
No credit cards.
I sold my car to do belts.
I'm eating peanut Butter
and jelly sandwiches.
It's not as bad as ketchup.
Ketchup and Mustard is good.
You ought to try it sometime.
I'm not that desperate yet,
but coming up on it soon.
Right now it's pb&amp;js.
But just doing my part
to try and Make things work.
I'm a person who's patient,
reasonable,
and I want to
make something happen.
So three sharks are out.
Mark and Daymond,
what are you going to do?
Narrator:
Three sharks are out.
Daymond and Mark are Nathan's
last chance to make a deal.
You're impressive.
Very impressive guy.
So let me
enlighten you.
Accessories are
the hottest thing selling now,
But just one design of a belt
is not a business.
Holdsaffle: Right.
Right?
That's for sure.
That's the biggest
challenge,
but I'm really impressed
by you.
Getting off the plane and
walking around West Hollywood
and selling belts
door-to-door --
Cuban:
And let me just say,
I relate to that, because I sold
garbage bags door-to-door.
I sold candy
door-to-door.
I sold greeting cards
door-to-door.
Yeah.
I sold magazines
door-to-door.
You name it, I sold it.
Takes guts.
No, it just takes
confidence.
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you doing something?
I'm patient.
Oh, you want to wait
for me?
Exactly.
Okay. No problem.
John:
Doing this offer,
I would really want it to be
for a license reason,
but the biggest challenge
with that is
you're the best salesman.
So we would have to
do something
where we license it
to a company,
but you also do sales
and you're the head of sales
and you get a commission
for that as well.
I will make you
an offer...
...for $50,000
and 40% of the company.
We're gonna take it, obviously,
to a license guy,
a partner of mine,
and they're gonna do
all the manufacturing,
product development,
and you'll also
head up the sales team.
That's my offer.
Take his offer.
I'm out.
Would you settle for 30%?
I will absolutely settle
for 37.5%.
Daymond, I'd be crazy
to not want a partner like you.
I accept 100%.
My man.
[ cracks belt ]
Harrington: Wow.
That's a deal.
That is a deal.
What a dream come true
for me.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It's a pleasure
to meet you.
[ laughs ]
Congratulations.
[ laughs ]
I'm happier about being
in business with him.
You should be.
Yeah, he's gonna call me
every morning
and say, "Hey, why don't you
get up and do something?"
I was able to get a deal
with Daymond, of all people --
Just so lucky.
I couldn't have dreamt it
any better.
It's just absolutely wonderful.
