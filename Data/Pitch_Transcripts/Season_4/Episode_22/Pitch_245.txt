are Jeff Stafford
and Dusty Holloway
with a product they believe
is going to explode
in the fishing market.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jeff Stafford,
and this my longtime
hunting and fishing buddy
Dusty Holloway.
Our product
is the shell bobber.
We are seeking $80,000
in exchange for 20% equity --
That's 20% of the coolest
fishing accessory
to ever hit the market.
Now, earlier this year,
Dusty and I went hunting,
and after firing
a shotgun,
the empty shell fell into the
water and floated perfectly.
I immediately thought,
"That'd be a really cool
fishing bobber."
The market would be huge,
as we'd be combining
two complementary
multibillion-dollar industries,
hunting and fishing.
So we took the bobber
and we went to work.
The first thing we did
was deprime it.
And after depriming it,
we stuffed it
with a floatable material.
And after that,
we inserted a cap
to make it look
real pretty-Like.
And then, once you do that,
you insert a wooden dowel
with slot in it
for the fishing line
and then a spring on top of that
to make it stay on the line.
Bobber up.
And bam.
We had our very first
shell bobber.
We were in love.
In order to find out
if others would be as excited
about the product as we were,
we had to test the market.
I took the prototype
and I called on local
bait-And-Tackle shops.
People loved it so much,
they were actually stealing it
off the shelves.
We tested the market,
we proved the concept,
and now we're here
looking for help,
because we know every store
that sells fishing accessories
is going to want to sell
the shell bobber.
With a product this hot,
our passion, and your expertise,
I know we can get it
in every one of those stores.
So, sharks, which one of you
can I get on my hook,
and which one needs
a three-Second head start?
[ gun cocks ]
[ laughter ]
Jeff, I wonder if we have to use
all dead shells.
Why not keep them alive
so when the fish pulls on it,
it blows it
right out of the water?
Cuban: That's what I thought
you were doing anyway.
Yeah, but that wouldn't
have been a fair fight.
Harrington:
So, Jeff, they're real shells?
Stafford: They are real
shotgun shells -- 100%.
And what's your cost?
Our cost for the three-Pack
like that
is actually under $1.
Under $1.
And what are you selling it for?
We retail that for $8.99.
Wow.
So, Jeff, this is
an important question,
because I love fishing.
I love the whole thing,
but $80,000 for 20% --
Please don't
mess this pitch up --
What are the sales?
So in our market test,
we sold 440 units.
It was a little
under $1,000.
[ laughter ]
Jeff, now I understand
why you brought the shotgun.
[ laughter ]
'cause that's the only way
you're getting money today.
So I want to just make sure I'm
getting everything straight.
You've sold less than
$1,000 worth of product?
Correct.
Daymond, he said they were
flying off the shelves,
what do you mean they were
flying off the shelves?
You know, honestly,
this is brand new to us,
but to give you
an example --
Ace hardware put us
in a pilot location,
and they were selling
about a bobber a day.
For us, it doesn't sound like
flying off the shelves,
but for them in the
fishing-Accessory world --
they're a hardware store.
They had people coming in
buying a screwdriver.
They ended up
buying a bobber.
They're not
looking for this.
Right.
They put us in another location
for about the same success.
Well, there's 4,400
ace hardwares.
If we can get in that, that's
1.6 million bobbers a year.
Are you selling these online?
Do you have a patent, trademark?
Is everything locked up
with all this?
We've got a provisional patent
on the shell itself.
We've trademarked
"Shell bobbers"
and We've trademarked
the name "Fishing ammo."
do you see anything wrong
with the valuation
that you've put on the company?
Honestly,
for a start-up company
that hasn't really
officially launched a product,
it's very tough
to come up with any valuation.
Yes. I agree.
What we did was we decided
how much money we needed
to get this going
the proper way,
with the machines,
the inventory, legal fees,
turning that
into a real patent,
and then
some operational expenses.
I think it's gonna sell.
I really do.
I think people
are gonna buy this thing
if you get distribution,
which could be challenging.
There's probably a distributor
in your sector
that supplies 80%
of the fishing-tackle stores.
You don't know
who that is yet, right?
Yes, I do.
Okay. Have you
shown it to them?
No.
Why not?
I'm kind of a perfectionist
in that I didn't really want to
take it to a lot of places
until I was confident
we had a product and packaging
that would be impressive.
I think
there's something here.
I'm willing to make you
an offer.
I haven't finished.
I'll make the first offer.
No, I want to make
the first offer.
Excuse me.
No, I want to make
the first offer.
I want to make
the first offer.
Whoa!
I'm getting
the shotgun.
People normally
would give you three --
I think there's
market confusion.
Well, people would normally
give you three times,
five times sales
if you're lucky.
I'm willing to offer you
eight times sales for 20%,
and you raise
the other the $72,000...
Cuban:
That's not an offer!
...from one of the other sharks.
That's like picking up
a Crumb and saying,
"I just handed you
a cake."
I gave them
eight times sales!
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary:
He's just messing around.
He's not being a shark.
He's being a minnow.
Exactly.
I'll make you a real offer.
You ready?
Please. Please.
Here's how
it's gonna work.
I'll give you $80,000
for 50%, all right?
But how do I get
my money back?
So here's
what we're gonna do.
Every time you sell one,
I get 50 cents, all right?
And after I get my money back,
that drops down to 10 cents.
That simple.
You know what? That's not
a bite. That's a throw-back.
Greiner:
Wait, Jeff, Dusty --
It was better than Daymond's,
I have to say.
[ laughter ]
That's True.
John: Whoa.
What am I here?
At least we're improving.
You got two non-offers.
Put aside the nonsense.
How are you gonna scale?
'cause the challenge --
It's not a lot of money.
You know, you guys
don't need a lot of cash
'cause your margins
are huge, right?
So that's not the issue.
I'm guessing you were afraid
to go to the distributors
because if they gave you
a big order,
there's nothing
you can do.
If we sold 10 million of these
a year, what are you gonna do?
I could make 10 million
in a year.
You're gonna do them?
You're gonna
make 10 million a year?
Myself? No.
Just simple question --
just how?
There's reloading machines,
crimps them,
and then the last thing
we have to do
is put the dowel
on them.
So it's still
a manual process
where you've got to
have someone
physically doing
the Insertion?
Yeah.
A part of the money
that we're looking for
is to get out of his garage
and into a place
where we can
keep the inventory,
a few new machines
that we need to purchase,
and then a few people
making an hourly wage
that we can just have
stuffing the bobbers.
Now, listen.
We're talking, we're squawking.
But nobody's making any offers.
I'm the only one.
Before you consider
Kevin's offer, let me...
you gonna
throw something at them?
Well, let me throw something
at you.
I don't think you really have
a company yet.
I think you have
a cool product.
Will it sell
in the millions
that you can build
an entire company around?
I don't know.
I'm out.
I love fishing.
I'm not being funny.
I probably fish about five
or six times a month.
It's a great idea.
I think it's too soon for me
because it's such a small,
you know, proof of concept,
so I'm out.
Okay.
Greiner:
I have a question.
Yes.
The provisional patent,
obviously a utility patent,
what did your attorneys
tell you?
What were their thoughts
as to whether or not
they think you'll get a patent
on this?
Well, we actually did
the provisional ourselves.
So you did not do
an extensive search.
No, I have not
done an extensive search.
But, you know, I would be
willing to do a deal
contingent upon
a search being done
and having you feel
more comfortable about it.
Wow.
He's got confidence.
Were you thinking
of doing --
Like, you started to talk
about other extensions.
We've had a couple people
ask us for --
there's glow-in-the-dark
for nighttime fishing
where We actually can get clear
shells and do glow-in-the-dark.
You can do glow-in-the-dark
plastic, yeah.
And we're going to do
a saltwater shell, as well,
that rattles
to attract the fish.
So yeah, we can do
different variations.
O'Leary: The question is --
You have no offers.
Lori's squawking,
not doing anything.
I'm not squawking.
I'm the only offer you have.
What are we doing here?
Well, any other offers?
Lori? Mark?
Doesn't look good.
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.
Jeff and Dusty have an offer
from Kevin O'Leary,
but they're hoping to get a
better offer from Lori or mark.
Question is --
You have no offers.
Lori's squawking,
not doing anything.
I'm not squawking.
I'm the only offer you have.
What are we doing here?
Well, any other offers?
Lori? Mark?
Doesn't look good.
What was your offer
again?
It was so horrible
I don't remember it.
I will have to have him
recap that, actually.
You ready?
It's very simple.
You know, I never forget
a good offer,
so I'm able to tell it to you
again with ease.
I give you the $80,000
for 50%.
Every time you sell one,
I get 50 cents
until I get my $80,000 back,
and then it drops to a dime.
It's that simple.
Yeah, you know, honestly,
I don't think we're comfortable
giving away 50% just yet.
You know what, guys?
You just gave the right answer.
You're getting out there
and hustling
and doing it
the exact right way.
So for that reason,
I'll make you an offer.
I'll offer you the $80,000,
and I want 33%.
Not 33 1/3%
so we're all the same,
but 33%, so this way, you both
own more stock than I do, right?
So it's still
your baby,
and you guys have
all the incentive --
but $80,000 for 33%.
What's wrong with you?
Greiner: [ laughs ]
I see nothing wrong
with you.
Deal?
He must be scared
of that shotgun.
What are you
talking about?!
yes or no, guys. You got to be
able to say yes or No.
These guys put a shell
on a --
You got to be able
to say yes or no.
Yes, we will accept
your offer, Mark.
Done.
Greiner: Oh, my God.
I wasn't even out yet.
John: Shocking.
Mark, you're the one.
[ laughs ]
of course.
Congratulations, guys.
Good job.
What is going on
with Cuban this season?
What do you mean?
I take great deals
And make them better.
You guys just have no vision --
None whatsoever.
Oh, my god.
They put a shotgun shell
on a string.
Are you kidding me?
You guys have no vision
whatsoever.
That's a horrible,
horrible deal.
You guys just don't know
how to invest in people, then.
You really don't.
These guys are doing
everything exactly right.
Why did you put
such a high valuation on it?
You spent more than that
last night on cocktails.
So?
Thanks to mark Cuban
and his investment
and belief
in our product,
shell bobbers
are gonna be a reality
in every fishing store.
We are gonna be living
the American dream.
Narrator: In season 3,
Billy Blanks jr. Made a deal
with Mark Cuban and Daymond John

that deal.
John:
