Hello.
My name is Aaron Lemieux.
My company is tremont electric,
Can I see it, Aaron?
Yes, sir.
Aaron, I keep it
in my backpack or briefcase --
Mm-hmm.
How much power do I have there
after eight hours?
Depending on how rapidly
you walk,
you could have
up to a 20% recharge
in your cellphone.
So, who is this for?
Is this for
the everyday person,
or do you want this for hikers,
people in the wilderness,
boaters, people
who are in positions
where they really
may need energy?
That is our initial
target market --
people that have
a very compelling need
to be able to have mobile power
When they need it,
where they need it.
What's the science
behind it?
The science
is kinetic-Energy harvesting.
The generator component --
We use the faraday effect,
which is a magnet passing
through an induction Coil.
Aaron, you know,
the only thing
that I worry more about
than the debt in America
is our consumption
of energy.
Something's got to change.
There's got to be
new technologies.
There's got to be new ways
to create it.
This could be part
of the answer --
I don't really know --
but I'm not making
the connection
Okay, Aaron, you know,
as far as I'm concerned,
you've proven
the concept.
Whether or not this is
a successful retail product
is irrelevant
when that's the prize.
