Hello.
My name is Aaron Lemieux.
My company is tremont electric,
and I'm seeking
a $2 million investment
for a 22% equity stake
in my company.
Whoa.
Mm-hmm.
Mobile electronic devices,
smartphones --
It seems like our entire lives
are revolving around these days.
But they have one fatal flaw --
The batteries always run out
whenever we need them the most.
But you don't need to worry
about that anymore.
We have a technology
that allows us
to harvest an energy
that's all around us.
Introducing our first product --
The award-Winning npower Peg,
the world's first
human-Powered charger
for mobile electronic devices.
This takes
your human walking Motion
and turns it into the power
that you need.
Simply place it inside of a bag
and go about
your daily activities.
The Peg stores your power
for when you need it the most --
when you're out of power and
you're away from a wall outlet.
With this investment
and the right partners,
we'll be able to change
the way the WORLD makes energy.
Can I see it, Aaron?
Yes, sir.
And all you have to do --
It's by motion. It has to move.
You can't have it
sitting somewhere still.
That is correct.
How long does it hold
its power or energy?
Hold its charge?
Yeah.
That's actually
one of the interesting features
of this product.
Because it has a kinetic-Energy
generator built into it,
it's continuously recharging
the battery that's inside of it.
I see you have
a lot of patents up there.
Yes, ma'am.
Can you tell us
What those cover?
They cover the BASIC
operating principles of this.
So no one else can do it?
That is correct.
Aaron, I keep it
in my backpack or briefcase --
Mm-hmm.
How much power do I have there
after eight hours?
Depending on how rapidly
you walk,
you could have
up to a 20% recharge
in your cellphone.
So, who is this for?
Is this for
the everyday person,
or do you want this for hikers,
people in the wilderness,
boaters, people
who are in positions
where they really
may need energy?
That is our initial
target market --
people that have
a very compelling need
to be able to have mobile power
When they need it,
where they need it.
What's the science
behind it?
The science
is kinetic-Energy harvesting.
The generator component --
We use the faraday effect,
which is a magnet passing
through an induction Coil.
How much do you sell them for,
and how many have you sold?
We sell them for $199.
We've been selling them
through our web store,
and we've sold 1,300 of them
up until this point.
What does it cost you
to make them?
It costs us
about $110 to make them.
It's expensive.
It is.
It was very much
a proof of concept,
and it went out into the market.
We needed to prove
that there is a market.
For $2 million,
you better be selling me
on where this is
in 10 or 15 years
that's gonna revolutionize
the world
instead of a backup battery
that goes on your phone.
All right.
What I plan on doing
to be able to change the world
is this image right here.
The reason why we have
the extensive patent portfolio,
why we have a device and We've
commercialized something
as a proof of concept
was because this technology
applies to mass-Wave-Energy
power generation.
So what you're saying --
You're gonna put them
in the ocean,
and you're gonna Harness
the power of waves.
That is affirmative.
From walking to wave --
Capturing energy from waves.
Well, we've been able
to demonstrate
that we can take
normal human walking
and make usable power off of it.
The exact same technology
is able to do the same thing
in waves.
Is it comparable to wind?
Is it better than solar?
It's comparable to wind,
and the studies that we've done
show that the power we could
produce from a wave farm
would be price-comparable
to coal-Fired power.
It seems to me that there are
at least three companies
that are
in the turbine business
that might be interested
in this technology.
Why isn't all the energy
of this company
to simply take these patents
and go and license it
and prove this concept,
which is ultimately
the best use of this technology?
This is crap
compared to that.
Why are wasting
with a little shake weight
when you can go
and start in the water
and start working
on smaller concepts there?
It's a company.
We've got a product.
So that's what it's about
right now --
You're trying to create revenue
because you need the Revenue.
Correct.
Okay. That's fair.
The reality is you said you've
sold 1,300 of these at $199,
so you've made $130,000
off of these things.
You know, that's very,
very commendable.
If you would have
walked in here
and said, "Look at
this operating business.
"I just made $130,000
in a few years.
"This product's selling.
"Help me get started,
and with your connections,
let me tease you with this,"
I might have bitten.
Okay.
But when you try to sell us
on your plan
and ask for $2 million,
that's a different beast
altogether,
so I have to
tell you I'm out.
I think
you're brilliant.
I hope that
you find a way
in which to make
this dream come True.
But I don't know
that I'm the right person
to help you get to such a big,
global level.
So for that reason,
I'm out,
but I wish you
good luck.
Thank you very much.
Aaron, you know,
the only thing
that I worry more about
than the debt in America
is our consumption
of energy.
Something's got to change.
There's got to be
new technologies.
There's got to be new ways
to create it.
This could be part
of the answer --
I don't really know --
but I'm not making
the connection
between this and that.
I'm just not seeing it.
I'm out.
Okay.
Keep in mind, the strategy here
is crawl, walk, run.
This is crawling.
We have other business
development opportunities
that are in our pipeline
that are actually starting
to create revenue
at this point, too,
like the military application --
Being able to reduce
the battery weight
of soldiers in combat by 25%
by harvesting the power
that already exists
on the battlefield.
John: You're a smart guy.
I can't add value.
I'm just not excited
about it.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Well, I think at this point,
four sharks are out
and only Kevin is left.
Okay, Aaron, you know,
as far as I'm concerned,
you've proven
the concept.
Whether or not this is
a successful retail product
is irrelevant
when that's the prize.
And I think it's
very interesting technology.
If it's true,
if you have some proof
that this is equivalent to
the efficiency of burning coal,
this is obviously
a better solution.
So what I would have
liked to have done
is said,
"I'll get on board.
I'll buy a piece
of this company,
and I'll take it to g.E."
But I can't play,
'cause it costs me $2 million
so that I can work for you.
How twisted is that?
Sounds like America
to me.
No.
It sounds like
you made a mistake to me.
I'm not gonna pay you $2 million
and then do the heavy lifting.
That's insane.
That's un-American.
I'm out.
Okay.
All the best.
Thank you all very much
for your time.
I really do appreciate it.
I think
he's got something.
I hope he makes it.
Yeah, I do too.
I feel strongly
that we're on the right path,
we're doing the right stuff
and we're gonna be growing
our clean technology
into a multibillion-dollar
company.
