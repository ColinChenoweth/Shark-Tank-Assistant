My name is Carole Foster,
I'm from Compton, California,
Hi. I'm Carole Foster,
creator of Mee-Ma's
Louisiana gumbo bricks.
I'm seeking $200,000
in exchange
for 20% of my company.
You know, good gumbo
is really hard to find,
I love gumbo, Carole.
The seafood one
is in the front,
chicken in the back.
Okay, I'll try the Seafood.
Okay.
(Robert) Ooh, it's got some
jalapeño kick in there.
You taste that?
All right.
It is delicious.
Thank you.
It is very good.
Who's ready to be
a gumbo geek like me?
Carole, has that okra
been frozen, that I'm eating?
That okra is frozen.
Damn, that's good.
Yeah.
Carole, who's the lady
in the photo?
What do I do
once I get the base, Carole?
You're gonna add
6 to 8 cups of water
to every gumbo brick...
thank you.
Carole, do you have sales
of your product today?
Yes, I do.
We've sold
gumbo bricks at the church.
(Lori) Wow.
However, my latest success is,
this has been selling
at various costcos in the area
for the last two years,
So, Carole,
you were in costco,
Carole, you obviously
have a great product.
You're working hard.
It's obviously your life,
Carole, by asking
for $200,000 for 20%,
you're telling me
that your business
is worth a million dollars.
Yes.
Which it isn't right now.
I-I... you know,
I rarely get this kind of angst
in--in the--
in the shark tank,
'cause I'm very definitive.
The product
is so fantastic,
but the infrastructure
isn't there.
(Robert) Carole, I, uh...
I love gumbo.
If it's on the menu
anywhere I go,
I order it.
The spicier the Better.
Okay.
Here's the thing about food--
the margins
are actually not very good.
Once you scale, it's a very
challenging business to run.
Thank you so much.
Wait a minute, Carole--
do you accept their offer?
I take your offer.
You got it.
Oh...
get ready
to work your ass off.
Oh, god.
Congratulations, Carole.
Thank you so much.
Awesome.
Oh, I appreciate it.
Oh, god.
I don't know what to do.
Congratulations on finding
a heart in the grinch.
(laughs) okay.
No, no, no.
That was shocking.
No, the food's good.
I'd never do this
if I didn't like
your product.
It's a great product.
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it so much.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Oh, yes!
Congratulations.
Aah!
