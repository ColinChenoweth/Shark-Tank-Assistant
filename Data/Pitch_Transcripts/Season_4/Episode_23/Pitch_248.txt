are Samantha Meis
and Connor Riley,
who want to make your next trip
to the coffee shop
a thing of the past.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Samantha Meis.
And I'm Connor Riley.
Our company is Mistobox,
and we are here today
seeking a $75,000
investment in exchange
for 15% equity
in our company.
Everyone loves coffee,
and our company Mistobox
is revolutionizing the way
that people discover coffee
from around the world.
More than 400 million
cups of coffee
are consumed daily
in the U.S. alone.
Coffee has never been
more popular than it is today.
Thanks to the boom
of small, local coffee shops,
we've all learned
it's the independent
artisan coffee roaster
that seeks out
the world's best beans
and artfully roasts a product
that is far superior
to anything you could find
in those big box stores
or huge national coffee chains.
But the question is,
how do we discover these coffees
to brew in our own homes?
Lori, you live in Chicago,
but let's say that
your perfect cup of coffee
is being grown
in Ethiopia,
then roasted in Tennessee.
(laughter)
How are you supposed
to find out about it?
Mistobox delivers
the world's best
undiscovered artisan coffee
to your door every single month.
Each Mistobox
is carefully packed
with four
fresh roasted coffee samples
from different mom-and-pop
coffee roasters.
We're coffee experts,
and we hand-Select
only the very best of coffees
to send to you.
After you brew
and pick a favorite,
you can head back
to our online shop,
purchase the full-size bag,
and we'll send it
straight to your door.
With free shipping!
(laughs)
We're helping these
small,
local coffee roasters
compete with the big guys
while introducing you
to amazing coffee
from around the world.
Sam's gonna pass out
some fresh brewed coffee
in our misto boxes
for you guys to enjoy.
Is it sort of like doing,
like, the brewery
or wine by the month
or something like that?
It's like
a book of the month.
Right. Right.
It's a subscription service.
It's a subscription service.
Exactly, Mark.
Tell us what we have
in front of us.
So, yeah.
You guys have some coffee brewed
from next month's Mistobox.
These coffees were grown
in El Salvador,
Guatemala, Ethiopia,
and Tanzania,
then they were sourced
and roasted in Washington,
Oregon, California,
and Colorado.
Okay, So, um, coffee's good,
all right?
(Samantha) Great.
I'm trying it. It's delicious.
I'm a coffee drinker.
What's the cost of acquiring
me as your customer?
Because I've never heard
of you before,
but I may be a customer.
How are you gonna get me?
So, so far, our cost
of customer acquisition
has been $4.60.
Oh, you know that number?
Yes, we do.
It's very rare
that somebody
with an online strategy
walks in here
and knows that number.
Yep.
You get special
bonus points for that.
Very good.
I will take another
sip then.
Great.
Thank you.
(Lori laughs)
(Mark) Where are you
guys from?
We're from
Scottsdale, Arizona.
Okay. How'd you get
into this?
So, we actually met
at the University of Arizona,
and we started the company
out of
the entrepreneurship program.
Are you dating?
We are not.
No, we're not dating.
Just friends.
Did you ever date?
No, we didn't.
Never dated.
How would I hear about you?
Where are you targeting me?
So right now we're really
targeting the coffee community
and the foodie community.
We were surprised to find
that the foodie-type people,
not just the coffee people,
were really receptive to us,
because they really want
to learn more about coffee.
So we're targeting the bloggers,
all of the different
publications.
All right, so grassroots.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Walk me through
the pricing model.
I hear about you.
I say, "Mistobox."
Right. So you can go back
online...
okay.
And we have three different
subscriptions,
and then three different
gift subscriptions.
Yep, just Mistobox.Com.
What do they range
in price?
They range $15
for a monthly subscription
and $14 for 6-month
subscription
and $12.50 for
a year-long subscription.
And then what do I--
how do you charge me more?
So, if you get
a year-long subscription,
you pay $150 on day 1,
and then that equates
to $12.50 a month
and you get that
for the full year,
and then at the end
of the year,
you're recurrently billed
for the following year.
There's no other cost?
Whether I keep it, send it
back, there's--That's it?
No matter what you do.
And if you get
a monthly subscription,
it's recurring billing
until you cancel.
And on that $150--
Let's work with that example.
Right.
So it's $150.
I paid you up front.
What's your margin on that
over the year?
So our margin is anywhere
from about 30% to 45%,
and we get the coffee
from the roasters
at a steep, steep discount
or for free.
How are they giving it
to you for free?
(Mark) So then--Yeah.
Why would they give it
to you for free?
We're a sampling department.
Because we are putting
their product
in the hands
of prequalified consumers
that want to try new coffees.
So, the advantage
to the coffee guys is,
I can't get my coffee
out there.
You're offering me
a distribution channel.
(both) Exactly.
And the hope for me
as a coffee guy
is that Lori will start
buying my coffee.
(both) Exactly.
Is that right?
Right.
Does a time come
when I, the customer, says,
"Oh, that coffee from Ethiopia
is all I care about"?
you know--
"That's all I want.
Just ship me that.
"Stop the madness on
the Mistobox coming every month.
"don't want to see that
anymore.
Just send me
my ethiopian coffee"?
Mr. Wonderful, as long
as you stay our customer,
we're happy.
We'll send you
your favorite coffee
on your schedule.
So say you want it
every two weeks, every week--
Yeah, well,
that's what you said.
You just go back to
your Web site And order
whatever coffee
you like, right?
You go back to the web site,
you order that coffee,
And you can choose
the recurring schedule you want,
whether that's--
so it's an auto-delivery.
It's an auto-delivery.
auto-delivery every month.
Every month.
It ships to you
whatever you choose.
Exactly.
Yeah. And you can switch
at any time.
There's no commitment.
'cause your margins--
What percentage convert
from that?
They start on the sampler box.
What percentage go
to the full-Time--
We have about--
right now, we have about
15% of our customers
coming back online
and ordering coffee.
So we have
two revenue streams--
Both from the subscription
and from the return online
sales.
How long have you
been in business,
and what have you done
to date?
Yes, so we've been operating
for about four months now,
going into our fifth month.
And we have a growth chart
here for you guys.
We just hit
our 700 customer Mark.
So in the past 21 days,
we've grown by 370%
and about, uh,
551 customers.
So, Connor, when you say
"Customers," can I assume
that those 700 people
are buying some type
of subscription?
Exactly.
Yes, they're buying
a subscription...
(Robert) Okay.
Whether it's a monthly,
6-Month, or annual.
And what you invested
in cash so far?
We actually had--are you guys
familiar with kickstarter?
Sure. Yeah.
We had a successful
kickstarter campaign
where we raised just over
$9,000.
That's what kind of
kickstarted us,
and then we've each invested
about $6,000 of our own money.
That's it?
Just--Yeah, it's just been--
It's just us two.
Um, we've been doing this.
And you guys just box,
pack, and ship them yourselves?
We do it--Everything--
Everything ourselves.
Everything.
Web site, design...
Yeah.
What's the game plan? What are
you doing with the $75,00?
What's the plan over
the next 12 months?
So with the $75,000,
we really need to--to grow.
We're gonna need to move
into a bigger space.
We're in her 1,200-Square-Foot
apartment
where she's living
and we're working.
We obviously don't have
the room that we need.
And we also need to hire
a little bit of help.
Samantha, Mark thinks he knows
everything about everything,
so...
(laughter)
So what do you think,
Mark?
I'm not all the way there yet.
Okay.
Well, what can we do
to get you there?
You can keep paying attention
to him,
who's not all the way there,
and potentially lose
the one that is
all the way there.
You know, if you know who you
want to have as an investor,
and it's Mark, do that.
I'm happy to retract my offer.
Please don't retract
your offer quite yet.
I'll give you 30 seconds,
and then
I'll take my offer back.
That should add some drama
to your lives.
Okay.
So either
you can convince Mark
to make a counteroffer--
and I'm convincible.
Okay.
So if you really wanted
to do a deal with me--
Mark, we'd love to do
a deal with you.
Mark, we would really love
to do a deal with you.
What can we do
to get you there?
Um, I need more equity even
than what Kevin offered.
Okay.
Because you're gonna
take more time...
ten seconds.
And you're gonna take
more effort from me.
If you're looking for
just the best deal--
can we ask for a standstill
and go talk in the hall?
(Lori) 30 seconds.
(Daymond) 20 seconds.
No, unfortunately, you've got
15 seconds left.
(whispers indistinctly)
