My name is Carole Foster,
I'm from Compton, California,
and I live with my 12-year-old
daughter Courtland.
My product is
Mee-Ma's Louisiana gumbo.
My gumbo is a secret recipe
passed down to me
by my Mee-Ma,
and it's the best gumbo
You'll ever taste.
Mmm, that's really good.
(horn honks)
My family and I decided
to sell gumbo
on the street corner,
and when we realized
how popular it was,
we realized
we have something
really good going.
Don't forget
to say your prayers.
I've sacrificed a lot
for this company.
We've been through a lot
of struggles, my daughter and I.
Financially, we've gone
through a lot
where we didn't have
enough money
just to make it
through the week.
I've gotten a lot of interest
from a major grocery chain.
They want to put my gumbo
in their stores,
but I just don't have the funds
to produce the orders
and Seal the deal.
I hope the sharks
really do like gumbo.
I hope they know
what good gumbo really is.
I hope that they'll see
that it's a good product
and they want to invest in it,
'cause we really need it.
Hi. I'm Carole Foster,
creator of Mee-Ma's
Louisiana gumbo bricks.
I'm seeking $200,000
in exchange
for 20% of my company.
You know, good gumbo
is really hard to find,
and so is the time it takes
to make it yourself.
I've been
a long-Haul truck driver
for the past 13 years,
so I've tasted quite a bit
of gumbo
throughout this country.
Besides being a truck driver,
I am a total gumbo geek.
A few years ago, friends asked
me to make gumbo for them
for the holidays,
but each in a different way.
And I just didn't have
time for that.
Because even for
an experienced cook like myself,
gumbo can take hours
to prepare.
So instead,
I made for them a frozen,
fully seasoned gumbo base
that they could add
whatever they like to it.
And so that's how Mee-Ma's
gumbo Bricks were born.
Now, I'd love
to have you try
some of the chicken
and seafood gumbo.
Absolutely.
(Robert) I'd love to try.
This one's seafood.
All right.
I'll try that one.
Okay.
I'll try the chicken.
That one's chicken.
I love gumbo, Carole.
The seafood one
is in the front,
chicken in the back.
Okay, I'll try the Seafood.
Okay.
(Robert) Ooh, it's got some
jalapeño kick in there.
You taste that?
All right.
It is delicious.
Thank you.
It is very good.
Who's ready to be
a gumbo geek like me?
Carole, has that okra
been frozen, that I'm eating?
That okra is frozen.
Damn, that's good.
Yeah.
That's really good.
And I want to say
to you,
Mr. Wonderful...
Yeah.
You are the okra
in my gumbo--
Slimy though it may be,
it adds character,
and it adds body,
and it adds richness.
You're describing me.
So--Exactly.
That's why I love okra.
(laughs)
I love it.
It's very tasty.
Exactly. All right.
Carole, who's the lady
in the photo?
That's my grandmother.
She lived to be 97.
She's gone to glory now,
but she's the one
who taught me
how to make gumbo.
The recipe is really
inspired by her.
When I buy the brick...
yes.
Do I add more to it,
or can I just
serve that up as is?
No. This one allows you
to put what you like in it.
So you've got the base?
This is the base.
Could we see the packages?
Sure. Sure.
What do I do
once I get the base, Carole?
You're gonna add
6 to 8 cups of water
to every gumbo brick...
thank you.
And up to 5 pounds
of meat of your choice.
And how long does it take
before I'm eating the gumbo?
45 minutes or less.
Carole, do you have sales
of your product today?
Yes, I do.
We've sold
gumbo bricks at the church.
(Lori) Wow.
However, my latest success is,
this has been selling
at various costcos in the area
for the last two years,
and I have about a half
a million dollars in sales.
Wow.
In the last two years?
Yes. But that's being
in one costco a week,
for only three days a week.
So you're setting up
and serving it
and presenting it?
Right.
As a road show item.
Right.
That's where
a lot of the money
that we've generated
over the last two
and a half years has gone to.
Wow.
Sounds like you're doing great.
Well...
you've gotten into costco.
Mm-hmm.
You're selling
half a million a year.
Yes.
What--what do you
need money for?
We need money so that we can
increase our inventory
and get it into more stores.
I currently have
a, uh, buy doc from costco.
(papers rustling)
and they are ready
and willing to accept
15 pallets of product
right now.
The problem--
15 pallets?
Correct.
It's gonna have to
be frozen, though, right?
It is frozen.
So is that
a permanent listing,
or they're gonna put it...
they're gonna put it in
as a permanent item.
As a matter of fact, we were
accepted as a permanent item
earlier this year,
and our problem was,
we couldn't keep up
with inventory.
They wanted us
to keep that freezer full.
We weren't able
to do that.
Congratulations.
What a wonderful problem
you have.
(laughs) Exactly.
Is that in costcos nationwide,
or is that in just a region?
No.
Just in the region,
here in L.A.
Can we see your order,
that you had referenced?
Yes, absolutely.
So, Carole,
you were in costco,
and you were
giving out samples...
correct.
And people were Loving it?
Yes. We sold 50,000 units.
So do you think
that you would be able
to get your gumbo
into the costcos nationwide?
Yes. Costco has
about 600 clubs nationwide.
Even if I were only able
to get into
a third of those stores,
the numbers
would be... incredible.
Well, tell us
about your costs
and what you're
selling them for.
That gumbo brick
Costs about $4 to make.
Okay, and that's
with Packaging, everything?
Correct. Out the door.
Um, we sell it to costco
for $9.99.
Can you get that cost down?
Uh, if I could
make bigger quantities.
I can only afford
to make small quantities.
You're doing great
at costco.
Mm-hmm.
Have you gotten
into any other retailers?
I've not
gotten into retail.
We really wanna
target the box clubs.
Because what--what they do when
they merchandise our product,
they put it
in a Coffin freezer
next to some $180 boxes of
lobster tails and scallops.
So we--
That's smart.
They're positioning
just right in there.
Yes, absolutely.
Well, it's a actually a platform
for all the ingredients...
absolutely. Exactly.
Which is even smarter.
Very interesting.
Yes, we've actually--
You have a commercial kitchen
doing this, right?
Uh, we have a...
commercial...
(Daymond) Co-Packer?
Co-Packer, yes.
Carole, you obviously
have a great product.
You're working hard.
It's obviously your life,
and that's a beautiful thing.
But in order to take $200,000
from an investor,
particularly me,
you've gotta be ready
to take the $200,000.
I just don't think you're ready
to take someone's money
and try to scale as big
as you wanna go yet.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
(whispers) okay.
But the gumbo's great.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
I came here because
I need the business acumen.
I don't have that.
I just know
that I make a great product.
And it's a good idea.
Um, I just--I need help
with that.
You have decent margins.
Have you talked
to anybody else
about giving them
a little bit more incentive
to make the product?
Actually, this
particular co-Packer
is willing to become
the vendor of record.
What their requirement is
is that I pay for the packaging.
And I don't
have money for that.
The packaging
for just that order alone
is about $10,000.
But you made
$100,000 this year.
Where'd the money go?
We're living off of it.
That's all we have.
We don't have anything else.
I have six brothers and sisters.
We're all
doing this business together.
We're crowded up in one house
trying to make it happen.
Okay. I-I-I got that.
As an outside investor,
how can we understand if we're
actually really making money
or losing money with you?
Yes.
I need--
I'm so--I'm so busy
with my guys, trying to
take care of my numbers.
Okay. I need help
in that--in that area.
And you will get there...
I definitely do.
And you're on a great path.
But as of now, I'm out.
(clicks teeth) okay.
Any other offers?
Carole, by asking
for $200,000 for 20%,
you're telling me
that your business
is worth a million dollars.
Yes.
Which it isn't right now.
I-I... you know,
I rarely get this kind of angst
in--in the--
in the shark tank,
'cause I'm very definitive.
The product
is so fantastic,
but the infrastructure
isn't there.
And I know that that's one of
my weaknesses. I definitely do.
Yeah, it is--It is a problem.
(Robert) Carole, I, uh...
I love gumbo.
If it's on the menu
anywhere I go,
I order it.
The spicier the Better.
Okay.
Here's the thing about food--
the margins
are actually not very good.
Once you scale, it's a very
challenging business to run.
'cause the margins
get smaller and smaller,
and you've really gotta run
a tight business.
Mm-hmm.
I'd rather see you
take your equity,
bring in an industry partner who
can guide you to that next step,
'cause you'll always
find the money.
I'm out.
I understand.
I understand.
Lori, what are you gonna do?
I think she wants
more gumbo.
Lori and Kevin are Carole's
last chance to get a deal.
Lori, what are you
gonna do?
Well, I have to say,
I love you,
and I love your Gumbo.
Thank you.
I was not even hungry,
and my gumbo's almost gone.
(laughs) okay.
So that's a testament
to your gumbo.
Okay.
Um, but I'm
kind of on the fence.
Because $200,000
is a lot of money.
As Kevin said,
your valuation's at a million.
And, uh,
that's kind of hard for me.
I-I-I don't think
you're there.
This is the smartest thing
I've ever come up with to do.
It's my life.
It's all that I do.
Um, right now, um,
I'm homeless.
I'm staying with friends
right now.
And when I'm not with them,
I go over to my sister's house
and stay with them.
And if not,
I have a Van. (chuckles)
But...
where does your daughter live?
She's with me.
She's always been with me.
And by her being with me
all this time,
she knows how
to write a business plan,
she knows how to,
you know, check prices
on different items
that we use.
She's, uh,
she's been there for me.
When I decided
to become a truck driver
and reinvent myself,
I felt empowered,
because I was doing
a "Man's job."
But I was taking care of my baby
at the same time.
And that's why I'm here,
because I'm here for her.
This isn't right.
I'll put up half.
This is crazy.
What do you wanna do?
She's got a product.
I know.
Wow.
Come in with me.
So the offer is
$200,000 for 50%.
For 50%?
What you have is a lot
of drive and a great product.
The problem is
you don't have a business.
And we're gonna
fix that for you.
Absolutely. I need that.
And so we feel it's important
that we run it,
and we help to make sure
that we make you
very, very successful.
Oh, my God. (laughs)
You're not worth
a million bucks,
but we're gonna
put you in business, okay?
That's what happens
here in the shark tank
if you're willing to work.
That's what makes
America great--People like you.
Thank you so much.
Wait a minute, Carole--
do you accept their offer?
I take your offer.
You got it.
Oh...
get ready
to work your ass off.
Yes!
And make a lot of gumbo.
Yes! Yes, yes. (laughs)
Thank you.
(Lori) You're welcome.
You're welcome.
This is great.
This is great.
Thank you so much.
Put you back in business.
Tell Costco we're coming.
All right.
Oh, my god, Yes.
Thank you so much.
That's terrific.
Oh, god.
Congratulations, Carole.
Thank you so much.
Awesome.
Oh, I appreciate it.
Oh, god.
I don't know what to do.
Congratulations on finding
a heart in the grinch.
(laughs) okay.
No, no, no.
That was shocking.
No, the food's good.
I'd never do this
if I didn't like
your product.
It's a great product.
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it so much.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Oh, yes!
Congratulations.
Aah!
She called you
a slimy something, and...
I like that.
(laughs)
What do you know?
Kevin has a heart.
Let's not go that far.
She had me from the moment
she called me slimy.
(laughs)
This deal
means everything to us.
This means that we can
actually have a real life now.
Um, it just means
that we can move forward,
and I can provide
for my daughter.
