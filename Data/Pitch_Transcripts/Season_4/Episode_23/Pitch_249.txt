Or swim.
Numbers never lie, David.
I'm not saying the numbers
are wrong.
What I'm saying is
you're wrong.
My name is David Glickman,
and I am the proud owner
of the Vermont Butcher Block
&amp; Board Company.
I'm here seeking $400,000
for 25% equity stake
in my business.
David, here's where
it doesn't add up for me.
Normally,
when people want money,
it's in order to lower
their cost
You know, David,
one of the things
I really like about me
is I'm always right.
Well, you think
you're always right.
I know I'm always right.
It's important to know that,
because in your case,
my vision of your business
is different than yours.
I'd argue to you,
when you actually allocate
the time that you're spending,
selling a spoon--
It's not really profitable
at all.
You don't agree with me--
I disagree--
I disagree, Kevin. I disagree.
We need to be
at the full line--
Why do you disagree?
Because--
Numbers never lie, David.
I'm not saying the numbers
are wrong.
What I'm saying is
you're wrong.
The only reason
a business exists
is to make money.
You can be passionate
about it--
I agree. I agree.
You and I don't agree
on the next direction.
That's what happens
in the shark tank.
We don't have to.
It's your business.
But it's my money.
I'm out.
(Daymond) Dave, um,
I-I love your Passion.
Thank you.
You have a good business
for yourself.
Thank you.
You're a smart guy, but I'm
just not excited about it.
I'm out.
Sorry.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Well, not thank you
for being out,
but thank you
for your feedback.
David, um...
make me an offer,
Robert.
Please.
Look, I-I love--
It's a great business.
It's not my--Not my kind
of deal, David.
Sure? Daymond? 40%?
Robert, 40%.
I do all the work.
We e-Mail once a month,
you give me your input.
It--I--
45%, Robert.
I don't feel comfortable
with giving you $400,000,
which is 50% of your sales.
So go in with mark.
$200,000 apiece.
You guys each get 22.5%.
You get enough skin in the game,
David, David, you're not
helping yourself.
I know. I know, but I--
I'm just--I'm trying,
because he's sitting
on the fence.
Well, David, how much
do you really want this?
Don't even go there.
David, thank you.
Don't even go there.
David,
you're overselling now.
Yeah.
Call me on Monday.
Thank you, guys.
I guarantee you he makes
no money in spoons. Zero.
(laughs)
