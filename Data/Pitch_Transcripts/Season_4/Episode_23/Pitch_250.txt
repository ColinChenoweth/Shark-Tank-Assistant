My Michael J. Desanti.
Mike D. for short.
I am seeking $130,000
in exchange
for 40% of my business.
And my business is
the squirrel boss
squirrel-proof bird feeder.
(sharks laughing)
Squirrel boss is
the world's first
interactive squirrel-Proof
bird feeder.
Now, we know squirrels
are extremely cute,
and they need to eat, too.
But they are 5-Pound gorillas,
and they are hogs!
But with squirrel boss,
if you see a squirrel
on your bird feeder,
and he wears out
his welcome,
just press the remote control
and deliver a harmless
static-shock correction.
(sharks laughing)
That is similar
to walking across the carpet
and touching something.
Buh-Bam! (laughs)
It tingles,
but it doesn't hurt you.
Who would like to challenge
the squirrel boss?
Whoo! (laughs)
You are up!
Please Come and grab
this squirrel boss.
(Robert) Mike,
can I please zap her?
You may.
(laughs)
