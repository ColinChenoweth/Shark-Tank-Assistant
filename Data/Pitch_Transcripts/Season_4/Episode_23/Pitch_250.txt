Or swim.
Numbers never lie, David.
I'm not saying the numbers
are wrong.
What I'm saying is
you're wrong.
My name is David Glickman,
and I am the proud owner
of the Vermont Butcher Block
&amp; Board Company.
I'm here seeking $400,000
for 25% equity stake
in my business.
We make the most awesome
and beautiful
Kitchen products ever,
in my opinion.
My wife and I left manhattan
after We burnt ourselves out
in the rat race.
We moved to vermont to live
our lives in calmer waters.
I took off my tie
for the last time
and decided to wear tie-dye
for the rest of my life.
I became
a true Vermontrepreneur.
The bottom line--
We make
premium quality products
using
Premium quality materials,
and we charge...
premium pricing.
Can you tell I love
the word "Premium"?
I'd like to pass out
some samples.
Ladies first, of course.
Thank you.
Lori, you have one of our
premium-grade cutting boards.
It's our small size.
Robert, you have
one of our cheese boards.
Kevin, you have
a walnut salad bowl
with the tiger maple rim.
Thank you.
Daymond, you have one of
our medium-sized cheese trays.
And, Mark, you have
our salad server.
So you've seen the product.
You've heard the spiel.
Who wants to join
the tie-dye tribe?
What's the tie-dye about?
Very good question.
When I quit the rat race,
I lived in New York City.
Yes.
I burnt myself out.
I said, "That's it.
I'm gonna wear tie-dye
for the rest of my life."
It was just a sign
of freedom for me.
I don't care if you wear
goat skin.
I want to know if you make
any money.
(laughter)
We are making money,
Kevin.
Okay.
Great question.
Uh, to date,
we've sold $2.9 million
worth of product.
Whoa!
Over what period of time?
I started in 2004.
Last calendar year,
we sold $800,000.
This year, we're s--
We're slated to sell
probably a million,
a million 50.
What are you gonna make
on that million dollars?
Uh, we're running about 20%.
What do you need us for?
I need money,
and I need somebody
who knows business
to help me grow the business.
You're, uh, asking for 25%
for $400,000.
That's around $1.6 million
you are valuing the business at.
And you made a profit
of $150,000 last year.
Yeah.
I figured one and a half
times sales.
Why did you figure that?
Let me go through my client--
My client list.
Daniel boulud
is our number-One client.
We have our retail store--
We have one retail store
up in vermont
where we can sell
all of our odds and ends
and we can test-market
our product.
It does about $400,000
a year.
Wow.
Internet, which is about
10% of our business.
Wholesale, which is about
10% of our business.
Uh, then we have
restaurants.
And we also just started
talking to Fleming's,
which is a chain out here
that you guys probably know.
We're in the orvis catalog.
We're in the frontgate catalog.
We've talked to Williams-Sonoma
three times.
Did they give you orders,
or you talked to them?
Talked to them.
'cause I talked to guy Named
Williams-Sonoma
three times yesterday.
We was at a dice game.
Well, we talked to them.
I don't know--
but then
they approached me.
They wanted 25 Pieces
for their top 12 stores.
We couldn't make the demand.
Right now I have
a-a 2,000-Square-Foot shop
on my property.
We need to move out
to a production facility
so I can grow the business.
I can't keep selling
if I can't produce.
Why wouldn't you focus on
the one thing
that you can differentiate
yourself in being--
The best chopping block
in America,
made from the trees of vermont,
and just focus on that?
Why do you need
to make these?
He has to offer more.
Thank you, Lori.
Do you know how inexpensively
these are made in Asia?
There's thousands of them.
They are. They are.
Absolutely.
And you know what?
They crack, they drop,
they're thin, they're bamboo.
Yeah, yeah, but they sell!
They sell.
Yeah, Kevin, you can't just
offer chopping blocks.
I sell
to the premium market.
Why not?
That sells--the--
the cheap ones sell to the--
to the people that want
to walk into walmart
and pay $2.99.
Okay.
People--but people who are
giving wedding gifts
don't want to give
a $2.99 bowl.
They want a nice set
of wooden bowls. I have--
I'm trying to figure out
how you carve a niche
in your space
that is defendable.
I think by expanding your
business into all this stuff,
you're going
into some categories
where there's tremendous
competition.
No. You--You know what?
I don't normally jump in
and speak
for the entrepreneur...
thank you, Lori.
I appreciate that.
But, Kevin, he can't just
sell chopping blocks.
Why not?
It's Boring.
That's right.
Because nobody Wants
just chopping blocks
from a company.
They want a number of S.K.U.S.
He's got a retail store.
(Lori) Yeah.
What's he gonna do all of
a sudden for his retail store,
go, "I'll stop"?
forget about it--
"I could sell tie-dye."
I forbid you to talk about
this topic anymore.
David, here's where
it doesn't add up for me.
Normally,
when people want money,
it's in order to lower
their cost
and increase their margin.
Your margin is fantastic.
It is to increase
our production capability.
We're profitable. I can sell
as much product as I can make.
Well, do you need machinery,
or do you need staff?
I do.
We need space,
we need machinery,
and we probably need
more people.
Nobody's brought this up,
so I'm--
I'm gonna bring up
something...
sure.
That might be
a crushing blow.
Uh-Oh.
You're competing against--
You know,
the new wave for all things
that are cutting boards
is antimicrobial boards.
You're aware of that.
I am.
And they're extremely
popular on the market.
The whole point about it is,
is that salmonella, e. Coli,
and other types of things
will not...
okay.
Leech into the board
and therefore
contaminate your food.
That's not True.
"Cook's illustrated" Came out
with an article,
and what they found was
that plastic cutting boards
kept the bacteria on them
longer
than the wood
cutting boards did,
because wood has a natural
propensity to kill bacteria.
I think you ought to ignore
all the comments.
I get that you're trying
to grow this business.
All you need is capital.
Basically, what you're saying--
You know your stuff.
In order for me
to be effective,
it means I have to make
a commitment to learn
the Butcher block
and board industry.
I don't feel comfortable
giving advice
unless I do the Work.
Okay.
I can appreciate that.
And if anything,
I-I do that too much.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
I'm a hard worker.
I am dedicated.
I am loyal to this business.
I know it has
a potential to grow.
I really do.
You know, David,
one of the things
I really like about me
is I'm always right.
Well, you think
you're always right.
I know I'm always right.
It's important to know that,
because in your case,
my vision of your business
is different than yours.
I'd argue to you,
when you actually allocate
the time that you're spending,
selling a spoon--
It's not really profitable
at all.
You don't agree with me--
I disagree--
I disagree, Kevin. I disagree.
We need to be
at the full line--
Why do you disagree?
Because--
Numbers never lie, David.
I'm not saying the numbers
are wrong.
What I'm saying is
you're wrong.
The only reason
a business exists
is to make money.
You can be passionate
about it--
I agree. I agree.
You and I don't agree
on the next direction.
That's what happens
in the shark tank.
We don't have to.
It's your business.
But it's my money.
I'm out.
(Daymond) Dave, um,
I-I love your Passion.
Thank you.
You have a good business
for yourself.
Thank you.
You're a smart guy, but I'm
just not excited about it.
I'm out.
Sorry.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Well, not thank you
for being out,
but thank you
for your feedback.
David, um...
make me an offer,
Robert.
Please.
Look, I-I love--
It's a great business.
I love the story, and I think
great Businesses are built
when somebody has the passion
like you.
But here--Here's my challenge.
As an investor, to give you
a $400,000 investment,
which is 50% of today's sales,
that seems risky to me.
And I don't know enough
about your business
to share your passion in it.
I'm out.
Lori?
I'll give you
a bigger percentage.
I want a partner who can
help me grow my business.
Well...
I think your work
is beautiful.
Thank you.
And I really respect
and admire what you've done.
But I am brutally honest.
And I--my concern is
the antimicrobial boards
are really coming on strong,
and they have been for years,
and they're taking
a larger part of the market.
I agree, but you say that
with no--With No...
and--
Uh, industry knowledge
on that.
I-I do have knowledge
about it, and it's okay.
I mean, I have my feelings,
you have yours.
But for me,
it's not a good investment.
I think it's too risky,
because I don't think
that you're
with the cutting edge
of what's really happening.
And for that reason, I'm out.
It's not my--Not my kind
of deal, David.
Sure? Daymond? 40%?
Robert, 40%.
I do all the work.
We e-Mail once a month,
you give me your input.
It--I--
45%, Robert.
I don't feel comfortable
with giving you $400,000,
which is 50% of your sales.
So go in with mark.
$200,000 apiece.
You guys each get 22.5%.
You get enough skin in the game,
and you let me grow
the business.
David, David, you're not
helping yourself.
I know. I know, but I--
I'm just--I'm trying,
because he's sitting
on the fence.
Well, David, how much
do you really want this?
Would you sell 51%
and give up the spoons forever?
He's playing you.
(Lori) Oh, don't--
No, I want to know.
I want to know.
You know what? Don't even.
I'm not that desperate.
I want a partner
that I can grow
the business with.
Don't even go there.
David, thank you.
Don't even go there.
David,
you're overselling now.
Yeah.
Call me on Monday.
Thank you, guys.
I guarantee you he makes
no money in spoons. Zero.
(laughs)
