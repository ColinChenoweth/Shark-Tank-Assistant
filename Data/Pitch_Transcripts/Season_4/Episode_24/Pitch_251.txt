 Kazam is a balance bike
 that is revolutionizing
 the way kids learn
 how to ride.
 If you notice, this bike
 does not have pedals,
 is developing balance.
 Think of it
 as a building process.
 You take one step at a time.
 With Kazam, children are
 able to learn by themselves
 at their own pace,
 which makes it easy
 for them to then transition
 onto a regular bicycle.
 With the help of Kazam,
 kids are having fun,
 while at the same time
 learning a life skill
 that will stay with them
 forever.
 Now, who's ready to ride
 the revolution with me?
 Hi, my name's Lance Yabut.
 (Barbara) That's fun!
 (Lance) Yeah, it was fun,
 right?
 It's fun!
 Did you have fun?
 But we weren't paying
 anything.
 Okay, boys, let's walk us
 through the business model here.
 Our business model
 is a corporate model.
 That stays on your
 balance sheet?
 That's correct.
 Lance, do you think
 for $3 million
 (Robert) Lance,
 you're a great hustler.
 I mean, you guys are out there,
 you're doing it.
 You're not the reason
 I can't be in.
 My time is the reason.
 You know--
 We just need
 a half an hour a week.
 That's all we're asking
 of your time.
 I-I gotta be out.
 Well, thank you.
 Anybody else here?
 You're the only one
 left, Barbara.
 You're it, Barbara.
 I believe everything
 you're saying.
 I think you got
 a good thing going here.
 I think you're... you're
 like an eveready battery.
 I think your valuation
 is way high.
 I think you know that
 already.
 So I'm gonna offer you
 $300,000
 for 33% of the business,
 all right?
 Okay.
 The only thing I want is
 when you pull your $100,000,
 he pulls his $100,000,
 as you take it,
 I want to pull my $100,000,
 too.
 (Robert) Oh! Interesting.
 Okay.
 Barb, you sly fox.
 I like the way you framed that.
 Okay, look, you guys--
 before you guys consider that,
 if that's in the ballpark,
 okay...
 we're open to suggestions.
 All right--
 My money's getting cold here,
 what do you say?
 But wait.
 Before you say yes...
 hang on.
 Wait, you're out, mark.
 No, I-I can come back in.
 No, you're not.
 There's no law that says
 I can't come back in.
 What do you say, guys?
 ??
 Four sharks are out.
 Thank you.
 Oh, you're just
 sucking up now, Lance.
 Thank you very much.
 All right, thanks, guys.
 Thanks for--
 thanks for all--
 Congratulations, guys.
