 Kazam is a balance bike
 that is revolutionizing
 the way kids learn
 how to ride.
 If you notice, this bike
 does not have pedals,
 and here's why.
 The key to learning
 how to ride a bike
 is developing balance.
 Think of it
 as a building process.
 You take one step at a time.
 With Kazam, children are
 able to learn by themselves
 at their own pace,
 which makes it easy
 for them to then transition
 onto a regular bicycle.
 With the help of Kazam,
 kids are having fun,
 while at the same time
 learning a life skill
 that will stay with them
 forever.
 Now, who's ready to ride
 the revolution with me?
 and the fact that we've
 created a loyal customer--
 I forbid you to do that.
 And I'm out.
 Hi, my name's Lance Yabut.
 And my name is Tom Kanemoto.
 We're seeking $300,000
 in exchange for 10% equity
 in pink shutter photobooths.
 We've taken the fun
 and nostalgia
 of the old-fashioned
 photo Booth
 and turned everything
 on its head.
 We're revolutionizing
 the entire industry.
 Have you guys ever tried
 to take a family picture,
 to only have them come out
 stiff and boring?
 With a super-fun
 pink shutter photobooth...
 (Robert chuckles)
 You won't even have to beg
 your kids to smile.
 Our pink shutter
 photobooths
 are some of the most premium,
 high quality,
 and luxurious photo booths
 in the nation.
 Unlike other cramped
 photo booths,
 our spacious booth
 means more people,
 more poses, and more fun.
 You can just imagine
 how interesting
 those pictures get
 as the night wears on.
 Only you won't have to
 imagine it,
 because not only do your guests
 get a high-Quality
 printout to take home,
 but you get a copy
 of all the pictures.
 Whoo-Hoo! Memories
 to last a lifetime.
 (laughing)
 So, sharks, enough talking.
 Let's get ready
 to have some fun.
 Come on down, pick a prop.
 (both) It's party time!
 Hey! Why not?
 Whoo!
 Let's go. Come on down.
 Come on down, guys.
 So, uh, we got a nice--
 a lot of cool props for you
 guys to choose from.
 So go ahead,
 put your props on...
 Oh, I love that.
 Whenever you pick them out.
 We knew that was for you.
 You guys are--
 It's definitely for me.
 Oh, there you go.
 Daymond, I feel like
 this one is for you.
 You got me, like...
 (laughter)
 Oh, yeah, baby.
 Money.
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.
 Get in here.
 Look at this guy.
 Wow.
 You gotta hold this.
 (laughter)
 (Robert) hang on.
 Get in here, mark.
 Get Cuban in here.
 Let's squeeze it in.
 Get in here.
 All right, hit it.
 (man) Nice.
 (Daymond) Cheese!
 (shutter clicks)
 (indistinct conversations
 and laughter)
 (Barbara) That's fun!
 (Lance) Yeah, it was fun,
 right?
 It's fun!
 Did you have fun?
 But we weren't paying
 anything.
 Okay, boys, let's walk us
 through the business model here.
 Our business model
 is a corporate model.
 We own and distribute
 all of our photo booths
 across many different
 locations.
 Currently, we're open
 in Sacramento, Los Angeles...
 thank you.
 And Las Vegas,
 San Francisco...
 Look at Daymond.
 And San Diego.
 (laughter)
 So do you own
 all the equipment?
 Yes.
 That stays on your
 balance sheet?
 That's correct.
 We own all the assets in
 the company, free and clear.
 How big, money-wise,
 is this business today?
 Well, in our first
 fiscal year,
 we pulled in about
 $195,000.
 In our second fiscal year,
 we're in our first quarter,
 and we've pulled in
 $135,000 already.
 Guys, look. Photo booths
 are ancient.
 What makes you guys
 different?
 Well, what makes us different
 is that we've cut
 the overhead costs
 from most photo booths.
 Most photo booth companies
 can only service events
 if they're making
 $1,000 per event,
 because it's a huge setup.
 So how much does each
 setup cost you, all in?
 It costs us about $3,500
 in equipment
 and about $500 labor
 to actually build the booth.
 (Robert) How are people
 finding it?
 As you go to a new market,
 how do I know you're there?
 Well, we have strategic
 partnerships already set up
 with the largest deal sites
 on the internet--
 Living Social and Groupon.
 So, are there any competitors
 that are doing
 the same thing you're doing?
 There are--There are a few
 competitors out there.
 We're not gonna lie.
 There's a lot of competition.
 So what is--Okay, so what's
 your secret sauce,
 or why are people coming
 to you?
 Well, one of the big things
 that makes us different
 is most photo booth companies
 that are out there
 are mom-and-pop shops
 that are more than happy
 to just be contained
 in that one area.
 Lance, do you think
 for $3 million
 I could find a couple of guys
 with pink shirts and black ties,
 buy some photo equipment,
 advertise in a few cities,
 and crush you
 like cockroaches?
 I don't--
 'cause that's the question
 you have to answer.
 That's the thing
 that matters to me.
 Now we're talking
 real money.
 This is not worth $3 million.
 You know why?
 There's nothing that's
 proprietary about it. Nothing.
 $3 million's a joke.
 I'm out.
 But we're making money.
 Last 30 days of sales--
 $83,000.
 This fiscal year, we're slated
 to make $500,000
 with no capital infusion.
 And what will your profit
 be on that?
 60%.
 Why do you need the money?
 We don't need the money.
 We have great credit.
 We have--We have banks
 that... (speaks indistinctly)
 I'll be your partner
 for no money. No problem.
 We need the strategic
 introductions.
 You guys paid yourself yet?
 Um, I currently do
 take a salary.
 What do you take?
 I'm taking $99,000.
 I know these don't
 sound like a lot, but...
 oh! Wait a minute.
 And the company made
 $300,000, correct?
 $333,000.
 So you took 30%
 out of the company already?
 No, not yet. No, I just
 started taking a salary
 just two, three months ago.
 Okay, so you're gonna
 pay yourself $100,000.
 What are you gonna pay
 yourself?
 I haven't really
 thought about it yet.
 No, no, no. Come on.
 Don't play possum with me.
 He's getting $100,000.
 Okay.
 What are you gonna
 pay yourself?
 Same.
 Same.
 So $200,000.
 $200,000 in salaries
 already, right?
 There's nothing wrong
 with that.
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.
 $200,000 in salaries, and you
 just took $300,000 from us.
 Okay. Can you generate
 $200,000 in sales?
 I believe so.
 Okay. You just
 made your money back.
 Yeah.
 No, that's not right.
 Guys, here--Here's
 the challenge.
 All you've done is shown
 everybody
 that there's a unique
 market out there,
 and while they may not be
 as good as you,
 you've set the price
 for your service,
 and the fact that there's
 huge margins
 for someone to come in
 and undercut you.
 For that reason,
 I'm out.
 You don't need the money,
 but yet you want $300,000.
 You're gonna pay each other
 $100,000 apiece.
 Only offering us 10%.
 Wanting us to go out
 and work for you.
 $300,000 is a lot of money.
 That is a lot of money...
 (speaks indistinctly)
 Right?
 I'm out.
 Thank you.
 (Robert) Lance,
 you're a great hustler.
 I mean, you guys are out there,
 you're doing it.
 You're not the reason
 I can't be in.
 My time is the reason.
 You know--
 We just need
 a half an hour a week.
 That's all we're asking
 of your time.
 I-I gotta be out.
 Well, thank you.
 Anybody else here?
 You're the only one
 left, Barbara.
 You're it, Barbara.
 I believe everything
 you're saying.
 I think you got
 a good thing going here.
 I think you're... you're
 like an eveready battery.
 I think your valuation
 is way high.
 I think you know that
 already.
 So I'm gonna offer you
 $300,000
 for 33% of the business,
 all right?
 Okay.
 The only thing I want is
 when you pull your $100,000,
 he pulls his $100,000,
 as you take it,
 I want to pull my $100,000,
 too.
 (Robert) Oh! Interesting.
 Okay.
 Barb, you sly fox.
 I like the way you framed that.
 Okay, look, you guys--
 before you guys consider that,
 if that's in the ballpark,
 okay...
 we're open to suggestions.
 All right--
 My money's getting cold here,
 what do you say?
 But wait.
 Before you say yes...
 hang on.
 Wait, you're out, mark.
 No, I-I can come back in.
 No, you're not.
 There's no law that says
 I can't come back in.
 What do you say, guys?
 ??
 Four sharks are out.
 Lance and Tom have one offer
 on the table from Barbara,
 and Mark may have had
 a change of heart.
 My money's getting cold here,
 what do you say?
 But wait.
 Before you say yes...
 hang on.
 Wait, you're out, mark.
 No, I-I can come back in.
 No, you're not.
 There's no law that says
 I can't come back in.
 What do you say, guys?
 At that valuation,
 I'm far more interested.
 I don't care
 about necessarily
 getting my money out
 immediately.
 I care about the growth.
 What I would do is
 do a deal comparable
 to Barbara--
 $300k for a third--
 But wouldn't take
 anything back
 until your sales hit
 a million dollars, so...
 that's only one year.
 Yeah, one year.
 Well, it's one year or two year,
 but at least you get there.
 I can get you to
 the event organizers.
 I have a company called
 axs tv
 that broadcasts
 live concerts,
 and we're partners
 with Aeg,
 setting them up
 at festivals.
 Branding it as axs tv,
 and having it there,
 the challenge
 is going to be
 we'd have to move
 incredibly fast,
 simply because I think
 competition is a huge risk.
 So I'll let you pick.
 W-Well, um,
 so you said
 you're gonna bring us
 into the concert industry.
 Right.
 And then, Barbara, what will you
 be bringing to the table?
 I'm gonna bring to the table
 exactly what I do
 for every one of my successful
 entrepreneurs.
 I'm gonna bring
 my marketing expertise.
 I'm gonna bring everything
 I know about business.
 Okay.
 I'm gonna be there
 when you need it.
 You're just going to get
 a real working partner,
 and, believe me,
 there is a difference.
 'cause if you were to speak
 to all of my entrepreneurs,
 that is what
 makes the difference
 between where they are
 and where they went.
 Can we have a minute
 to--to talk it over?
 Sure.
 Okay. Thanks.
 That was a creepy thing to do.
 Absolutely.
 What'd you do that for?
 Because once it became a good
 deal, it was a good deal.
 At $3 million,
 it wasn't a good deal.
 Yeah, but you rode
 on my good deal. Come on.
 I mean, I like
 both of their offers.
 You know?
 I mean, she's...
 $100,000!
 That's a lot of money.
 You should know better.
 You should know that I'm
 the better partner,
 and you know it, mark.
 Actually, you set it up,
 Barbara, I'll give you credit,
 but they're crazy--
 You'll give me credit?
 They're crazy to pay you
 a $100,000 salary.
 They're crazy!
 ??
 All right, so we actually
 have a proposal for you guys.
 Would you, Barbara and Mark,
 be willing to come in together?
 Do we get to take the salary,
 or which deal is it?
 Without the salary. With--
 Without the salary.
 Oh...
 so our counteroffer
 is $300,000,
 25% equity,
 with Barbara and Mark.
 I want to give you
 a piece of advice right here.
 We all noticed that you were
 about to say yes
 to Barbara's deal.
 Kevin calls this
 the "Bone in the mouth" theory.
 (laughs) Yeah!
 Now you're coming back
 and you're changing it,
 and I'm telling you--
 but--But Mark came in,
 and we feel that, like,
 both of you guys are so good.
Okay, so what is your fi--
 Your final offer is
 you offering a counter--
 That's not our final offer.
 That's our counteroffer.
 Your counteroffer is 25%...
 25%.
 For $300,000, split between
 Barbara and Mark,
 and no salary.
 No salary.
 Okay.
 (Barbara) Here's the thing.
 What I take exception to
 is the deal got worse.
 We had a 33% deal
 on the table,
 and you came back
 and offered 25%.
 We were gonna--Okay--
 Okay, that's a no.
 What do you say, Mark,
 on the percentage?
 Oh, absolutely not.
 Okay, so you have two nos
 on the 25%.
 Guys, I'll make it easy.
 Part of the drill
 in going through this
 is you guys presenting your
 decision-Making process.
 Right? You--
 You weren't definitive,
 and I don't want to be
 in a scenario
 where it's wishy-Washy
 and we're not sure, we like it,
 but we're not quite there.
 I'm out.
 What just happened?
 (Kevin) You know,
 two lab rats left
 the shark tank...
 (Barbara laughs)
 They came back in.
 They got slaughtered.
 I hate it when that happens.
 ??
 What are you going to do?
 All right, Barbara,
 we accept your offer.
 Good deal.
 (laughter)
 'cause you're
 the only one left!
 You're the only one left!
 All right, baby.
 (Kevin) Ahh.
 All right, Barbara.
 Good deal.
 I really believe that you
 will put in the time.
 Yes, I really will.
 Thank you.
 Oh, you're just
 sucking up now, Lance.
 Thank you very much.
 All right, thanks, guys.
 Thanks for--
 thanks for all--
 Congratulations, guys.
 All your help
 and everything.
 Good luck. Congratulations.
 Barbara,
 that was really clever.
 Thank you.
 You're getting--You're getting
 the same salary they are.
 Hey, I deserve it.
 We're so happy we're
 working with Barbara.
 She said she's gonna
 put the time in.
 This partnership
 with Barbara,
 it's gonna take us
 to a whole 'nother level
 we've never been able
 to reach before.
