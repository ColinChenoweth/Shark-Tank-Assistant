 Hi. My name is Mary Beth Lugo,
 Beth, I think you should
 send the kiddies off,
 because I have a bunch
 of questions
 they probably
 don't wanna hear.
 Can you ride off, honey?
 (Robert) Oh, what a diva.
 She doesn't want to leave.
 (laughs) So cute.
 What are you making them for
 Mary Beth, my option,
 if I'm struggling
 in this economy,
 is I can buy training wheels
 for $19,
 or I can buy a Kazam.
 Both outcomes
 are gonna be the same.
 Children have been learning
 how to ride a bicycle
 for decades
 with training wheels.
 It's that it's improving
 the way they're
 learning to ride.
 (Barbara) How did you
 come up with the idea?
 Born out of need, or...
 actually, this concept
 has been popular
 in Europe for some time.
 We had a European neighbor
 who introduced us
 to this idea.
 We tried it with my own child
 who was then 2 at the time,
 What are your sales,
 Mary Beth?
 Tell us about your sales.
 You know, what are they...
 to date--
 We haven't been in business
 quite three years.
 We have $1.4 million.
 Whoa. What's your sales
 in the last year
 Okay, Mary Beth.
 I think what's going to
 happen here is
 you're going to require
 a significant amount of capital.
 Mary Beth, it sounds like you're
 becoming the market leader.
 It scares me that you would
 want to go away
 from something that you're
 great at, you're growing,
 Mark has made
 Mary Beth an offer,
 but she must convince
 a skeptical Barbara
 to go in on the deal.
 $300,000 for 40%...
 (Kevin) Ouch!
 Okay?
 (Daymond) Ooh.
 But it's contingent
 on you convincing Barbara
 to come in with me.
 So she does not get
 Barbara to come aboard...
 I'm out.
 Mary Beth, I'm gonna
 give it to you right now.
 You say to Barbara,
 "Listen, you witch."
 (laughter)
 "If you don't come in
 on this deal,
 I'm gonna set you on fire
 with Lighter fluid."
 Set her 24-Second clock,
 please.
 There he goes.
 Are you ready?
 Go.
 Go.
 I've had to learn
 this business
 from the ground up.
 I did not have any prior
 business experience.
 Nobody knows this company
 more than I do.
 I get up early, I work while
 my kids are at school,
 I take them to soccer,
 I come home,
