 Hi. My name is Mary Beth Lugo,
 and this is my product,
 Kazam.
 I am here today seeking
 $300,000
 in exchange for 20% equity
 in my business.
 Beth, I think you should
 send the kiddies off,
 because I have a bunch
 of questions
 they probably
 don't wanna hear.
 Can you ride off, honey?
 (Robert) Oh, what a diva.
 She doesn't want to leave.
 (laughs) So cute.
 What are you making them for
 and what are you
 selling them for?
 We make them for $28.25.
 The wholesale price
 is $45.
 Direct to consumer
 for $99.95.
 Mary Beth, my option,
 if I'm struggling
 in this economy,
 is I can buy training wheels
 for $19,
 or I can buy a Kazam.
 Both outcomes
 are gonna be the same.
 Children have been learning
 how to ride a bicycle
 for decades
 with training wheels.
 It's that it's improving
 the way they're
 learning to ride.
 (Barbara) How did you
 come up with the idea?
 Born out of need, or...
 actually, this concept
 has been popular
 in Europe for some time.
 We had a European neighbor
 who introduced us
 to this idea.
 We tried it with my own child
 who was then 2 at the time,
 and he learned like that.
 (snaps fingers)
 Wow.
 Me made our own design.
 We have a patented frame design.
 (Barbara) What age category
 would be on this bike?
 Maybe 2 1/2
 up to 5, 5 1/2.
 It kind of depends on--
 but I'm curious to why
 this company
 already has been doing this
 in Europe,
 and then they're not
 selling over here
 if it was a-a product
 in demand.
 Actually, we are not
 the only ones now
 in the market
 in the United States.
 Okay.
 But what's different
 about ours
 is the patented
 frame design
 with the foot rest area.
 And...
 tell us about your competition.
 How much are they selling?
 The market's actually
 fragmented right now
 with several small companies
 like ourselves.
 How many?
 Five or six, probably.
 What are your sales,
 Mary Beth?
 Tell us about your sales.
 You know, what are they...
 to date--
 We haven't been in business
 quite three years.
 We have $1.4 million.
 Whoa. What's your sales
 in the last year
 and the year before?
 Last year
 were $611,000.
 In 2010, they were
 $384,000.
 Great growth.
 (Kevin) What do you think
 you'll sell next year?
 Next year we're projecting
 $1.5 million.
 On the million dollars,
 what will your profit be?
 The profit margin is
 about 36% to 37%.
 I have a problem
 with your margins.
 They're not enough.
 How do you get them up
 to 45%, 47%?
 Well, right now we're
 in a situation where
 we're doing batch
 manufacturing, which means
 a small quantity
 that we're ordering--
 1,680 bikes...
 do you know how many you'd
 have to buy at a time
 to increase your margins
 by 20%?
 You gotta get them up
 to close to 50%.
 We realistically would have
 to get to about 50,000.
 50--so you've got a ways
 to go then.
 Fantastic growth.
 If it maintains this way,
 you're gonna suck up
 a lot of cash.
 Mm-hmm.
 The only way to get
 some relief from that
 is to enhance these
 margins dramatically.
 Okay, Mary Beth.
 I think what's going to
 happen here is
 you're going to require
 a significant amount of capital.
 And that's what I don't like
 about your deal.
 Because, for me, it's
 how do I get my money back?
 I'm not gonna take
 that chance.
 I'm out.
 Okay.
 And let me just say this--
 This is not limited
 to toy and bicycle.
 This bridges to education,
 preschools,
 daycares,
 occupational therapy.
 Have you gone back
 to the european market,
 Mary Beth, it sounds like you're
 becoming the market leader.
 It scares me that you would
 want to go away
 from something that you're
 great at, you're growing,
 and then start competing with
 a huge market
 with huge competitors.
 Why would you do that?
 Well, and I'll tell you why--
 Because we get asked
 all the time
 from our retailers,
 "When are you coming out
 with something new?"
 we want to build
 a brand--
 Yeah, you're, you know,
 you're gonna drown
 in opportunity.
 Entrepreneurs make
 that mistake every day.
 Just because somebody asks
 doesn't mean you should do.
 I commend you on the sales.
 You made a great argument.
 I mean, you've answered
 all the questions really well.
 It's just a personal thing.
 I wouldn't buy one.
 I'm not saying
 that's good or bad.
 You gotta have somebody along
 for the journey
 who really believes in it.
 Um... I'm not that guy.
 I'm out.
 (Daymond) Uh, I think you have
 a great concept here,
 but if I gave you my money,
 I would feel like
 I would never get it back.
 I'm out.
 Mm. Okay.
 What I'm concerned about
 is I don't see your competition
 as being only
 the tricycle market.
 It's the tricycle market,
 the training wheel market.
 It takes a lot of money
 and Real high focus.
 I'm wondering--
 You have a very mild manner.
 Are you the type of person
 that could do that?
 Really? I'm surprised
 you said that. (laughs)
 I just don't feel
 that fire in you.
 Listen, I'm the one
 that's running
 the day-to-day operations.
 I could picture you
 as organized, but again,
 even in that answer, I don't
 feel that fire coming out.
 Are you willing to pour boiling
 oil over your competitors?
 (laughter)
 (Mark) Yeah.
 That's what she's asking you.
 In a nice way.
 Are you saying
 she's not aggressive?
 I'm not sure.
 I'm here because
 I want to blast them away.
 I want to emerge this company
 as the Leader in this market.
 Barbara's right.
 When you get a chance
 to step on the throat
 of your competitor,
 you just gotta step, squish...
 gosh.
 And let the roadkill be
 picked up by somebody else.
 You give articulate answers,
 nice and steady as you go,
 but I'm looking
 for that thing, that heat!
 You're right. I'm a shy person.
 I'm a reserved person.
 But I have spent
 every day
 of the last three years
 working on this
 because I know
 it's a proven concept.
 I know that we can be
 the Leader.
 And I want to be
 that person
 who is poised and ready
 to enter the mass market
 when that time comes.
 You know what? I'm gonna--
 I'm gonna find out just how much
 killer you have in you.
 I'm gonna make you an offer.
 $300,000
 for 40%...
 (Kevin) Ouch!
 Okay?
 (Daymond) Ooh.
 But it's contingent
 on you convincing Barbara
 to come in with me.
 Three sharks are out.
 Mark has made
 Mary Beth an offer,
 but she must convince
 a skeptical Barbara
 to go in on the deal.
 $300,000 for 40%...
 (Kevin) Ouch!
 Okay?
 (Daymond) Ooh.
 But it's contingent
 on you convincing Barbara
 to come in with me.
 So she does not get
 Barbara to come aboard...
 I'm out.
 And I'm gonna give you
 24 seconds to convince Barbara,
 so you're going to have to
 come high and Come hard,
 and we'll find out just
 how aggressive you are.
 (Daymond) Let's go.
 Mary Beth, I'm gonna
 give it to you right now.
 You say to Barbara,
 "Listen, you witch."
 (laughter)
 "If you don't come in
 on this deal,
 I'm gonna set you on fire
 with Lighter fluid."
 Set her 24-Second clock,
 please.
 There he goes.
 Are you ready?
 Go.
 Go.
 I've had to learn
 this business
 from the ground up.
 I did not have any prior
 business experience.
 Nobody knows this company
 more than I do.
 I get up early, I work while
 my kids are at school,
 I take them to soccer,
 I come home,
 and I work until 11:00 at night
 every single day.
 This has become my life.
 And I am not willing
 to walk away from it
 until we become
 the top leader.
 I'm sold. Mark, I'm in.
 Do we have a deal?
 (exhales)
 (Kevin) 40%.
 40% is high!
 It'll be worth it.
 40% is too high.
 We valued our company
 correctly,
 and I'm definitely
 confident in that.
 Then come back and make
 a counteroffer.
 Could we do 32%?
 ??
 Okay, okay, okay.
 $300,000 for 32%,
 Barbara and I partnering
 together,
 and we come in and we make
 Kazam huge.
 Do we have a deal?
 We have a deal.
 Amen.
 (Daymond) All right.
 (Barbara) Nice.
 (clapping)
 I'm proud of you.
 (laughs)
 Thank you.
 A big hug.
 Awesome. Thank you.
 You got better
 as you went.
 Exactly.
 Barbara, you hurt
 my feelings.
 I love you!
 I wanted to hurt
 your feelings!
 I wanted
 to hurt your feelings!
 Thank you.
 I need to take one of these
 home for jakers.
 Jake's gonna love it.
 I never thought insulting
 people was the way to go,
 but you brought something
 out of her.
 That's--She's a snake.
 Who?
 Barbara.
 (laughter)
 I can't believe this.
 I can't believe this.
 It's a dream come true.
 It's what I've been
 working for for so long--
 for the last three years.
 This is going to be
 the big break.
 ??
 Earlier this season,
 Cheryl Rigdon
 failed to get a deal
 with the sharks
 for her makeup tool,
 the Spatty.
 I think we're all in love
 with you.
 It's just too early for us.
 Let's see what she's
 up to now.
 ??
 Even though I didn't
 get a deal,
 I haven't given up
 on the Spatty or Spatty Daddy.
 Oh, you saw us
 on "Shark Tank"?
 before "Shark Tank," I only
 sold 15 Spattys.
 After "Shark Tank,"
 through my web site,
 I've received pre-orders
 for 7,000 Spattys.
 At one point, I had to stop
 taking orders for the Spatty
 because I was completely
 sold out.
 Sales from my product
 have reached $32,000.
 You know, it might not seem like
 a lot, but that's huge to me.
 Well, I can't wait
 to see it.
 And with that money,
 I've been able
 to take my handmade
 prototype
 into a mass-produced product
 at a real factory.
 There you go. Is that what
 you were looking for?
 Yes! That is awesome!
 I'm really proud to say
 that I'm building this company
 on my own.
 When the sharks said
 they didn't have time
 to build a company
 from the ground up,
 I didn't understand that then,
 but I understand it now.
 (laughs)
 It was great talking
 to you, too, Daymond.
 Thank you.
 In the tank, Daymond offered
 to help commit me to people
 in the beauty industry.
 Not only has he done that,
 but he's worked with me
 to help me find
 a licensing deal.
 "Shark Tank" was definitely
 the catalyst
 to get my business
 off the ground.
 Company's doing great,
 and, you know, the future's
 looking really bright
 for the Spatty and Spatty Daddy.
 ??
 Next up are Lance Yabut
 and Tom Kanemoto
 with a way to make every party
 more memorable.
