 I'm Erica Cohen.
 Hi, I'm Erica Cohen.
 For Robert, I have
 an all-American girl,
 (Erica) Just simply because
 the product is great.
 People love it.
 I mean, literally,
 Erica, what's your profit?
 We take home about 15%,
 as opposed to a 10%
 But, Erica, you get this
 once-in-a-lifetime chance...
 Mm-hmm.
 To get in front of us...
 right.
 To pitch an idea.
 You come out
 with a working concept,
 Erica, so what?
 You're putting in 80 hours
 a week
 in the restaurant, too.
 Absolutely.
 I've worked in restaurants,
 I've lived in them,
 I've opened them,
 I've put my money in them.
 It takes ten times more money
 to open one restaurant
 than set up one more truck.
 You're right.
 You could have ten times
 the leverage,
 ten times the sales,
 with the same amount of money.
 I love racing, but not many
 people in North America
 Love motorcycle racing.
 Correct.
 Absolutely.
 Americans love nascar,
 not this kind of racing.
 Correct.
 When we attach an actor,
 that will sell to America.
 If I put, uh, Ryan Gosling
 in this,
 my girlfriend's gonna go see it
 because of Ryan Gosling.
 But earlier you said that
 the actor's not important.
 No, uh...
 now you're saying he is.
 I'm gonna jump in here
 for a second.
 The actor's not attached
 by design.
 We're too early
 in the stages.
 If I put an actor
 to it at this point,
 when we got down the road,
 it may not warrant
 the sales that I need.
 Walk me through
 the numbers a little bit.
 I give you $5 million today.
 You don't have a script.
 or are all of your sales
 in north America?
 Actually, we just got
 picked up by
 the largest sporting goods
 store in all of Europe.
 It has 700 stores.
