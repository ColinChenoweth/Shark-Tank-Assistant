 I'm Erica Cohen.
 And I'm Lori Barbera,
 and our company is...
 (both) Baby's badass burgers.
 Smokin',
 O.B., no cheese.
 Baby's badass burgers is
 a mobile food truck concept
 that has a gorgeous
 pink truck,
 beautiful burger babes,
 and the best burgers in L.A.
 Order up.
 I have an extensive
 background
 in events and marketing.
 And my background is
 in the restaurant industry.
 I've opened and launched
 many restaurant concepts.
 Whoo!
 Together,
 we're the perfect duo.
 We really do have
 the perfect Burger.
 I agree.
 It's not an easy thing to
 make the perfect cheeseburger.
 You have to have a great
 bun-To-Meat ratio,
 you have to have quality meat,
 the perfect bun,
 and quality ingredients.
 We have all of those
 with Baby's.
 Great. Thank you.
 Thank you. Enjoy.
 (Erica) We're ready to
 take Baby's to the next step.
 We have a huge hit
 on our hands,
 and this is just
 the beginning.
 One taste of our burgers,
 and we know
 that the sharks
 will be hooked.
 ??
 Hi, I'm Erica Cohen.
 And I'm Lori Barbera,
 and our company is...
 (both) Baby's badass burgers.
 And we're looking
 for $250,000
 for 30% of our business.
 Baby's badass burgers
 is a playfully unique
 and entertaining
 bright pink mobile food truck
 that sells high-quality
 gourmet burgers
 served by a fun, friendly,
 and attractive staff.
 While opening a restaurant
 in L.A.,
 I met and became friends
 with Lori,
 who also shared my love
 for the almighty burger.
 We took our concept
 to the streets of l.A.
 In late 2009,
 and have developed
 a cult-like following
 ever since.
 Our motto is,
 "Come for the burgers,
 stay for the buns."
 (laughter)
 Today... (laughs)
 Today we've brought some of
 our signature burgers for you
 so you can try these
 beauties for yourselves.
 For Robert, I have
 an all-American girl,
 and for Barbara, I have
 a she's smokin'.
 (Barbara) I like the way
 it sounds.
 We know you like
 barbecue sauce.
 Yeah, I do like
 barbecue sauce.
 (woman) For Kevin, I have
 an original beauty.
 For Daymond, I have
 the other woman.
 Thank you.
 (laughs) The other woman!
 Yeah, this baby got back.
 And for Mark,
 I have the perfect 10.
 Thank you.
 Oh, please!
 Stop sucking up!
 (laughter)
 Wow, this is the heaviest
 Burger I've ever...
 (Barbara) I know.
 That's our half a pound
 "Maneater."
 That's a lot of meat,
 ladies.
 Yes, it is.
 It is.
 It's a great burger.
 Thanks.
 Thank you.
 All we need
 is an investor
 to jump on board so that
 soon you'll see
 a baby's badass burgers
 in every major city.
 So, which one of you sharks is
 going to take the biggest bite?
 So I give you $250,000.
 How do you spend that money?
 That's going to, um,
 our first storefront.
 So you've been successful with
 the trucks, and now you're
 giving that up?
 Very successful.
 Great, wildly successful
 with the truck...
 interesting.
 And now it's time
 to turn this into
 a brick-and-mortar business.
 What makes you think that
 the brick-and-mortar will work?
 (Erica) Just simply because
 the product is great.
 People love it.
 I mean, literally,
 we open the doors, and we get
 a line wherever we go.
 Different business.
 The minute you--
 it is, but--
 we know.
 We--know. We--we really know.
 You guys do realize $250,000
 won't cover the front door?
 It will not.
 No, it'll--
 we actually have some of our
 own money to invest as well.
 Yeah.
 We put ourselves
 in an excellent position
 so that we are able
 to also put $50,000.
 Okay, that's still not
 gonna get it done.
 Still not gonna be enough, though.
 It's not gonna come close.
 Is that even enough
 to open the first store?
 Yes.
 Absolutely.
 We're looking at
 a 1,500-Square-Foot-Joint.
 Square foot.
 So you're not considering
 making more trucks?
 Cor--are you?
 We're not considering
 the trucks.
 (Barbara) why not?
 We want to roll these out
 as storefronts.
 Why not? Why not?
 Because trucks,
 as--As fun as it is,
 it really was always
 the vision
 to roll it out
 brick-and-mortar.
 And that's what we do.
 That's where
 our experience lies.
 (Kevin) are you actually
 profitable?
 We sure are.
 Yes.
 In the three years that
 we've been in business,
 we've done $815,000.
 (Daymond) Total?
 Total.
 Yes.
 Average was $250,000 a year?
 Well, we're looking to do
 $375,000 by december.
 Erica, what's your profit?
 We take home about 15%,
 as opposed to a 10%
 which is usually standard
 in the restaurant--
 and that's after paying
 yourself, everybody?
 You've paid yourself as well?
 We're included in that.
 Okay.
 But, Erica, you get this
 once-in-a-lifetime chance...
 Mm-hmm.
 To get in front of us...
 right.
 To pitch an idea.
 You come out
 with a working concept,
 and you say, "No, we're not
 gonna do that.
 We're gonna do this drawing,
 which we've never done."
 No, and we--we have that.
 I mean, we--
 (speaks indistinctly)
 right.
 Lori and both come from
 the restaurant industry.
 Exactly.
 Between us, we've both
 opened seven restaurants, so...
 but how many of these
 restaurants have you opened?
 None yet.
 We're coming with a concept,
 a brand, and a product...
 right.
 And an experience
 that we knew was--
 We know is already proven.
 That store is gonna cost
 $750,000 to open it.
 You won't know for three months
 if you're gonna make it or not.
 There's so many--
 So much risk
 that you don't have now
 with your business model.
 Operating a physical location
 like that
 costs hundreds
 of thousands of dollars.
 I don't get it. What's
 the matter with you people?
 Why aren't you sticking
 to the trucks?
 Why aren't you saying,
 "Mr. Wonderful,
 "Give me $250,000
 to open up 5 more trucks.
 In return, it's 20%."
 Why isn't that the story?
 Our--Our dream is to open
 restaurants.
 Yeah, but you're telling us--
 You're telling us
 you don't understand
 the fundamental tenets
 of business.
 Yeah.
 Number-one rule--
 Follow the money.
 And the money is right
 in front of you.
 It may be great
 that you have a dream
 to open up a restaurant...
 Mm-hmm.
 But I'd rather follow
 the green than the dream.
 And this doesn't mean you won't
 open the restaurant.
 Yes, it does.
 I forbid you.
 If they get to 20,
 30 trucks...
 I forbid you to ever
 open that restaurant.
 Why? Why would you
 say that?
 Because it's a really
 bad idea.
 You have a business
 that's making money.
 You've just proven
 the concept.
 Why have you decided to open
 a brick-and-mortar operation
 instead of replicating
 this truck?
 I think there's a cap-out
 on the trucks.
 It's a cash business. Um,
 you have to be so hands-on.
 You have to be present.
 And... we really want--
 there you go!
 There you go!
 Hands-On--
 Ding, ding, ding, ding,
 ding, ding, ding!
 No, I'm on that truck
 every single day.
 I work my ass off.
 You understand that when you
 own a restaurant...
 Erica, so what?
 You're putting in 80 hours
 a week
 in the restaurant, too.
 Absolutely.
 I've worked in restaurants,
 I've lived in them,
 I've opened them,
 I've put my money in them.
 It takes ten times more money
 to open one restaurant
 than set up one more truck.
 You're right.
 You could have ten times
 the leverage,
 ten times the sales,
 with the same amount of money.
 I understand your point
 to expand on the trucks.
 It was our vision to really
 go for it
 and do the brick-and-mortars.
 None of your data
 works in a brick-and-mortar.
 It is a completely
 different business.
 Good pitch on the truck.
 Bad pitch on
 the brick-and-mortar. I'm out.
 I kind of get why finally--
 why you want to open
 a restaurant.
 I think you're looking for
 a home for your business.
 You just want to settle in
 Somewhere.
 Um, what disturbs me--
 You love to invest
 in a business where someone's
 in love with their business,
 instead of the guy who's trying
 to get out of that business
 and get into the new business.
 The idea that you're
 escaping
 what you're doing now
 and don't want it anymore
 makes me want
 to escape it, too,
 so I'm out.
 The truck
 isn't going anywhere.
 I mean, we'll always
 have the truck.
 It's absolutely not going anywhere.
 The truck will help
 the restaurant,
 and the restaurant
 will help the truck.
 Right.
 Although I love seeing
 a truck, and you're right,
 maybe it would be great
 to see ten Baby's trucks,
 I see bigger than that.
 That's always been
 the bigger picture with us.
 Guys, I-I see the--the value.
 I also see the constraints
 on the truck.
 But it's a very
 binary decision.
 Either it takes off
 and explodes,
 or it craters
 very, very quickly
 Like any number of--of people
 who had a lot of vision,
 a lot of hope,
 and a lot of great burgers.
 Also, I know $350,000
 is not gonna get it done.
 I don't think you really
 put the numbers on paper enough
 to really dig in to see
 what it's going to take,
 and for that reason,
 I'm out.
 I'm gonna give you a 9
 out of 10 on the Burger.
 I'm a burger connoisseur.
 We love that. Thank you.
 I've eaten them from
 all around the world.
 There's nothing wrong
 with the product.
 But I'm gonna give you
 a 1 out of 10 on your strategy.
 You charbroiled a great idea.
 You killed it.
 I mean, you have
 a fantastic business.
 But I think you came in here
 and got slaughtered
 by trying to push us
 in a direction
 that you hadn't proven.
 Had you said you could do
 ten trucks
 and you wanted $500,000,
 that might've been interesting.
 Um...
 I think you made
 a classic mistake in here
 in the shark tank today.
 I'm out.
 I've been listening
 very closely.
 What I was listening for
 was that at any given time
 as we were speaking,
 as partners,
 you would have said,
 "You know what?
 "Maybe we are being
 too aggressive,
 "and we're ready
 to rethink that concept
 and roll out the trucks
 and make some money."
 but you're too stuck
 on what you wanna do.
 And I was ready to give you
 the money.
 Too late. I'm out.
 Okay.
 Okay. Well, thank you.
 Thank you for your time.
 Good luck, guys.
 Thanks for the Burger.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Burgers are great, guys.
 Thank you.
 ??
 Good, now we can eat
 the Burger,
 relax a bit, you know?
 I finished mine already.
 Yeah. Wow.
 She was absolutely set
 on having a store.
 Definitely.
 It was a dream.
 She almost had a chip
 on her shoulder about it.
 (Daymond) Yeah.
 And nothing we said was
 gonna get her away from it.
 I think the sharks
 underestimated,
 um, our experience,
 how much we know,
 and our ability to open
 and launch a restaurant.
 It's gonna be their loss.
