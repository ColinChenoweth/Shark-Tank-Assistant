 and gain powerful partners
 to start, grow, or save
 their businesses.
 Our project is a full-length
 action film.
 I'm out.
 If the sharks hear
 a great idea,
 they're ready to invest
 using their own money.
 We're seeking $5 million.
 My money's getting cold here.
 And they'll fight each other
 for a piece of the action.
 Wait, you're out.
 I can come back in.
 Wait a minute,
 wait a minute.
 They're crazy!
 But first, the entrepreneurs
 must convince a shark
 to invest the full amount
 they're asking for,
 or they'll walk away
 with nothing.
 Now I'm gonna give you
 24 seconds
 to come high and come hard.
 Sharks, enough talking.
 (both) It's party time.
 It's sink...
 I'd rather follow
 the green than the dream.
 Or swim.
 You say to Barbara,
 "Listen, you witch."
 (laughs)
 "If you don't come in
 on this deal,
 I'm gonna set you on fire
 with lighter fluid."
 ??
 Who are the sharks?
 They're self-made millionaire
 and billionaire investors
 who are entrepreneurs
 themselves.
 Kevin O'Leary
 is a venture capitalist
 who turned a $10,000 loan
 into a software business
 worth $4.2 billion.
 Barbara Corcoran
 went from working
 as a waitress in Manhattan
 to building the city's
 preeminent real estate empire.
 Daymond John is a fashion mogul
 and branding expert
 who grew his homemade
 clothing line
 into the globally recognized
 fashion brand Fubu.
 Robert Herjavec, the son
 of an immigrant factory worker,
 is now a technology mogul
 Who sold his first
 internet companies
 for over $350 million.
 And Mark Cuban,
 notorious billionaire
 entrepreneur
 and the outspoken owner
 of the Dallas Mavericks.
 ??
 And I'm Lori Barbera,
 and our company is...
 (both) Baby's badass burgers.
 Smokin',
 O.B., no cheese.
 Baby's badass burgers is
 a mobile food truck concept
 that has a gorgeous
 pink truck,
 beautiful burger babes,
 and the best burgers in L.A.
 Order up.
 I have an extensive
 background
 in events and marketing.
 And my background is
 in the restaurant industry.
 I've opened and launched
 many restaurant concepts.
 Whoo!
 Together,
 we're the perfect duo.
 We really do have
 the perfect Burger.
 I agree.
 It's not an easy thing to
 make the perfect cheeseburger.
 You have to have a great
 bun-To-Meat ratio,
 you have to have quality meat,
 the perfect bun,
 and quality ingredients.
 We have all of those
 with Baby's.
 Great. Thank you.
 Thank you. Enjoy.
 (Erica) We're ready to
 take Baby's to the next step.
 We have a huge hit
 on our hands,
 and this is just
 the beginning.
 One taste of our burgers,
 and we know
 that the sharks
 will be hooked.
 ??
 And I'm Lori Barbera,
 and our company is...
 (both) Baby's badass burgers.
 And we're looking
 for $250,000
 for 30% of our business.
 Baby's badass burgers
 is a playfully unique
 and entertaining
 bright pink mobile food truck
 that sells high-quality
 gourmet burgers
 served by a fun, friendly,
 and attractive staff.
 While opening a restaurant
 in L.A.,
 I met and became friends
 with Lori,
 who also shared my love
 for the almighty burger.
 We took our concept
 to the streets of l.A.
 In late 2009,
 and have developed
 a cult-like following
 ever since.
 Our motto is,
 "Come for the burgers,
 stay for the buns."
 (laughter)
 Today... (laughs)
 Today we've brought some of
 our signature burgers for you
 so you can try these
 beauties for yourselves.
 and for Barbara, I have
 a she's smokin'.
 (Barbara) I like the way
 it sounds.
 We know you like
 barbecue sauce.
 Yeah, I do like
 barbecue sauce.
 (woman) For Kevin, I have
 an original beauty.
 For Daymond, I have
 the other woman.
 Thank you.
 (laughs) The other woman!
 Yeah, this baby got back.
 And for Mark,
 I have the perfect 10.
 Thank you.
 Oh, please!
 Stop sucking up!
 (laughter)
 Wow, this is the heaviest
 Burger I've ever...
 (Barbara) I know.
 That's our half a pound
 "Maneater."
 That's a lot of meat,
 ladies.
 Yes, it is.
 It is.
 It's a great burger.
 Thanks.
 Thank you.
 All we need
 is an investor
 to jump on board so that
 soon you'll see
 a baby's badass burgers
 in every major city.
 So, which one of you sharks is
 going to take the biggest bite?
 So I give you $250,000.
 How do you spend that money?
 That's going to, um,
 our first storefront.
 So you've been successful with
 the trucks, and now you're
 giving that up?
 Very successful.
 Great, wildly successful
 with the truck...
 interesting.
 And now it's time
 to turn this into
 a brick-and-mortar business.
 What makes you think that
 the brick-and-mortar will work?
 we open the doors, and we get
 a line wherever we go.
 Different business.
 The minute you--
 it is, but--
 we know.
 We--know. We--we really know.
 You guys do realize $250,000
 won't cover the front door?
 It will not.
 No, it'll--
 we actually have some of our
 own money to invest as well.
 Yeah.
 We put ourselves
 in an excellent position
 so that we are able
 to also put $50,000.
 Okay, that's still not
 gonna get it done.
 Still not gonna be enough, though.
 It's not gonna come close.
 Is that even enough
 to open the first store?
 Yes.
 Absolutely.
 We're looking at
 a 1,500-Square-Foot-Joint.
 Square foot.
 So you're not considering
 making more trucks?
 Cor--are you?
 We're not considering
 the trucks.
 (Barbara) why not?
 We want to roll these out
 as storefronts.
 Why not? Why not?
 Because trucks,
 as--As fun as it is,
 it really was always
 the vision
 to roll it out
 brick-and-mortar.
 And that's what we do.
 That's where
 our experience lies.
 (Kevin) are you actually
 profitable?
 We sure are.
 Yes.
 In the three years that
 we've been in business,
 we've done $815,000.
 (Daymond) Total?
 Total.
 Yes.
 Average was $250,000 a year?
 Well, we're looking to do
 $375,000 by december.
 which is usually standard
 in the restaurant--
 and that's after paying
 yourself, everybody?
 You've paid yourself as well?
 We're included in that.
 Okay.
 and you say, "No, we're not
 gonna do that.
 We're gonna do this drawing,
 which we've never done."
 No, and we--we have that.
 I mean, we--
 (speaks indistinctly)
 right.
 Lori and both come from
 the restaurant industry.
 Exactly.
 Between us, we've both
 opened seven restaurants, so...
 but how many of these
 restaurants have you opened?
 None yet.
 We're coming with a concept,
 a brand, and a product...
 right.
 And an experience
 that we knew was--
 We know is already proven.
 That store is gonna cost
 $750,000 to open it.
 You won't know for three months
 if you're gonna make it or not.
 There's so many--
 So much risk
 that you don't have now
 with your business model.
 Operating a physical location
 like that
 costs hundreds
 of thousands of dollars.
 I don't get it. What's
 the matter with you people?
 Why aren't you sticking
 to the trucks?
 Why aren't you saying,
 "Mr. Wonderful,
 "Give me $250,000
 to open up 5 more trucks.
 In return, it's 20%."
 Why isn't that the story?
 Our--Our dream is to open
 restaurants.
 Yeah, but you're telling us--
 You're telling us
 you don't understand
 the fundamental tenets
 of business.
 Yeah.
 Number-one rule--
 Follow the money.
 And the money is right
 in front of you.
 It may be great
 that you have a dream
 to open up a restaurant...
 Mm-hmm.
 But I'd rather follow
 the green than the dream.
 And this doesn't mean you won't
 open the restaurant.
 Yes, it does.
 I forbid you.
 If they get to 20,
 30 trucks...
 I forbid you to ever
 open that restaurant.
 Why? Why would you
 say that?
 Because it's a really
 bad idea.
 You have a business
 that's making money.
 You've just proven
 the concept.
 Why have you decided to open
 a brick-and-mortar operation
 instead of replicating
 this truck?
 I think there's a cap-out
 on the trucks.
 It's a cash business. Um,
 you have to be so hands-on.
 You have to be present.
 And... we really want--
 there you go!
 There you go!
 Hands-On--
 Ding, ding, ding, ding,
 ding, ding, ding!
 No, I'm on that truck
 every single day.
 I work my ass off.
 You understand that when you
 own a restaurant...
 I understand your point
 to expand on the trucks.
 It was our vision to really
 go for it
 and do the brick-and-mortars.
 None of your data
 works in a brick-and-mortar.
 It is a completely
 different business.
 Good pitch on the truck.
 Bad pitch on
 the brick-and-mortar. I'm out.
 I kind of get why finally--
 why you want to open
 a restaurant.
 I think you're looking for
 a home for your business.
 You just want to settle in
 Somewhere.
 Um, what disturbs me--
 You love to invest
 in a business where someone's
 in love with their business,
 instead of the guy who's trying
 to get out of that business
 and get into the new business.
 The idea that you're
 escaping
 what you're doing now
 and don't want it anymore
 makes me want
 to escape it, too,
 so I'm out.
 The truck
 isn't going anywhere.
 I mean, we'll always
 have the truck.
 It's absolutely not going anywhere.
 The truck will help
 the restaurant,
 and the restaurant
 will help the truck.
 Right.
 Although I love seeing
 a truck, and you're right,
 maybe it would be great
 to see ten Baby's trucks,
 I see bigger than that.
 That's always been
 the bigger picture with us.
 Guys, I-I see the--the value.
 I also see the constraints
 on the truck.
 But it's a very
 binary decision.
 Either it takes off
 and explodes,
 or it craters
 very, very quickly
 Like any number of--of people
 who had a lot of vision,
 a lot of hope,
 and a lot of great burgers.
 Also, I know $350,000
 is not gonna get it done.
 I don't think you really
 put the numbers on paper enough
 to really dig in to see
 what it's going to take,
 and for that reason,
 I'm out.
 I'm gonna give you a 9
 out of 10 on the Burger.
 I'm a burger connoisseur.
 We love that. Thank you.
 I've eaten them from
 all around the world.
 There's nothing wrong
 with the product.
 But I'm gonna give you
 a 1 out of 10 on your strategy.
 You charbroiled a great idea.
 You killed it.
 I mean, you have
 a fantastic business.
 But I think you came in here
 and got slaughtered
 by trying to push us
 in a direction
 that you hadn't proven.
 Had you said you could do
 ten trucks
 and you wanted $500,000,
 that might've been interesting.
 Um...
 I think you made
 a classic mistake in here
 in the shark tank today.
 I'm out.
 I've been listening
 very closely.
 What I was listening for
 was that at any given time
 as we were speaking,
 as partners,
 you would have said,
 "You know what?
 "Maybe we are being
 too aggressive,
 "and we're ready
 to rethink that concept
 and roll out the trucks
 and make some money."
 but you're too stuck
 on what you wanna do.
 And I was ready to give you
 the money.
 Too late. I'm out.
 Okay.
 Okay. Well, thank you.
 Thank you for your time.
 Good luck, guys.
 Thanks for the Burger.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Burgers are great, guys.
 Thank you.
 ??
 Good, now we can eat
 the Burger,
 relax a bit, you know?
 I finished mine already.
 Yeah. Wow.
 She was absolutely set
 on having a store.
 Definitely.
 It was a dream.
 She almost had a chip
 on her shoulder about it.
 (Daymond) Yeah.
 And nothing we said was
 gonna get her away from it.
 I think the sharks
 underestimated,
 um, our experience,
 how much we know,
 and our ability to open
 and launch a restaurant.
 It's gonna be their loss.
 ??
 Next up is James Lavitola
 and Brian Pitt
 with a unique investment
 opportunity for the Sharks.
 Hi. I'm James Lavitola.
 And I'm Brian Pitt,
 and our project
 is titled "Track days."
 We're seeking $5 million...
 (Robert) Whoa!
 (Daymond) That's
 a lot of money.
 In exchange for 34% equity
 in our production.
 Now, "Track days" is
 a full-length action film.
 I'm out.
 It revolves around
 the exciting world of...
 I'm out.
 A motorcycle
 world championship.
 I'm out.
 (laughs)
 You're so open-minded,
 Mark.
 I'm out. Did I say I was out?
 Again, "Track days" is
 a full-length action film
 that revolves around
 the exciting world
 of a motorcycle
 world championship.
 And what better way
 to make a blockbuster
 than by combining
 one of the largest-Grossing
 movie genres
 with the second-Most-Watched
 sport in the entire world?
 Which is?
 Professional motorcycle racing.
 Now, we went ahead
 and put together
 a little teaser trailer
 for you sharks.
 (Robert) Awesome.
 But no premiere
 would be complete
 without some
 Good old-fashioned
 American popcorn
 and candy.
 Carrie, our lovely
 umbrella girl,
 is gonna pass you out
 some treats.
 Thank you, Carrie.
 Now James will be dropping
 you off some premiere gift bags
 'cause we all want a little
 good swag
 when we go
 to a movie premiere.
 Let's start your engines,
 'cause the race
 is about to begin.
 (Robert) Vroom!
 (rumbling)
 (motorcycle engine roaring)
 (engine revving)
 (beeping)
 (revving continues)
 (tires screech)
 (hard rock music playing)
 (thudding and crash)
 (tires screeching)
 (crashing and whirring,
 motorcycles roaring)
 (crashing)
 (tires screech)
 (thud)
 ??
 (motorcycle roars)
 That's it?
 That's it?
 (laughing)
 So, boys, you want 5 million
 bucks to make a movie?
 I know how you feel
 that, you know,
 you think that filmmaking
 is a crap shoot,
 which we completely
 understand.
 However, Brian is considered
 somewhat an expert
 in this field.
 (laughs)
 And with the crap shoot
 statement,
 we're gonna make it
 so that you're the house,
 and the house always wins.
 (mouth full) How are you
 gonna do that?
 Brian?
 Happy to explain it
 to you.
 We're gonna be bringing you
 a packaged product
 that has, uh...
 efficient foreign sales,
 Efficient, uh,
 distribution.
 Efficient or sufficient?
 Sufficient.
 Essentially, what we'll
 be doing is we'll be
 putting a-a script
 together,
 which is in the process
 of being rewritten.
 You don't even have
 a script yet?
 We--
 we have the story.
 We have the story.
 We specifically decided
 to go a different
 route with this--
 me and my buddies get pitched
 stuff all the time.
 Absolutely.
 And we invest sometimes
 in movies,
 But nobody ever comes Along
 and says,
 "Give me money
 and then we'll do the work."
 They pitch the script.
 We say...
 absolutely.
 "We like it,"
 "We don't like it."
 "Who's the producer?"
 that is
 the traditional thinking.
 We're gonna educate you...
 correct.
 On the new way that films
 are financed,
 to where you guys aren't
 risking your money.
 (Barbara) So we don't
 put in money?
 We don't want you to risk
 your money.
 Often, what happens is,
 people go out
 and they put a script together
 and they get an actor,
 and then they come to a company
 like the one I used to run,
 where we would finance
 films.
 Do you have an actor?
 No. By design
 we don't have an actor.
 Specifically don't have
 an actor attached.
 Okay, so I know mark is--
 I know mark is already out--
 We're getting him back in.
 He's coming back.
 I've heard this story
 many times before.
 Yes.
 Um, I executive-produced
 "The Crow."
 Yes, we know that.
 (Kevin) You make any money?
 It became a horror flick in
 regards to making my money back.
 (laughter)
 So... I'm out.
 (Robert) This is a record.
 Now--
 This is the fastest two guys
 have ever dropped out.
 We're gonna get them back in.
 We're gonna get you back.
 We are gonna put together
 a package
 that you won't spend one dime
 until we show you
 foreign sales,
 domestic sales,
 distribution deals,
 product placement.
 You know, the film business
 is a bit of a chicken
 before the egg.
 You can make it happen
 if you have the money.
 You can make it happen
 if you have
 the best script in the world.
 You can make it happen
 if you have
 the best actor in the world.
 You know,
 and you can make it happen
 if you're the right people.
 Why would we have
 confidence in you
 and give you $5 million?
 What's your background?
 So, film-wise, I've been
 in the business
 for about 12 years or so.
 I've been head of production--
 Head of physical production
 for a--for a very
 successful indie company.
 We secured a 9-picture
 distro deal
 with a major studio.
 We've produced eight feature
 films that went theatrical.
 And...
 how many--How many did you
 make money on?
 We grossed well over
 $200 million.
 "Mr. Brooks" is one
 that did fairly well.
 It was Kevin Costner,
 Demi Moore, uh, Dane Cook.
 Did a movie
 called "Waiting..."
 that did
 very, very, very well.
 And what about you, James?
 What about you?
 What's your background here?
 Uh, when I was younger,
 I was on Broadway.
 I came to L.A., did stunts.
 You know, I'm a huge
 motorcycle fan.
 And there's been such a lack
 of movies made about them.
 (Robert) I have an issue
 with the subject matter.
 Yes, sir?
 You don't have an actor.
 (James) We have a story.
 What happens to my cash--
 What we wanna do
 is take your money,
 put it into let's say
 an escrow account
 or some kind of interest-bearing
 account
 to where we can't touch it.
 At that time, we can go and put
 the package together for you.
 We'll have a list of ten actors
 that fit the leading roles--
 So can't start the project
 until people know...
 until you approve of everything.
 That the cash is there?
 We will not start the project
 until you're happy
 with the calculated risk
 that you would have to take.
 Because it would be
 very minimal.
 Otherwise, we don't do
 the movie.
 Guys, let--Let me try
 to help you out.
 When you take a movie,
 and you have money behind it,
 then all the people you're
 pitching to think you're real.
 You're using our money
 as bait, basically?
 Correct.
 Yes, absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah. Absolutely.
 The movie business--
 It's the worst business
 I've ever seen in my life.
 But it can also be a very
 lucrative business.
 I can't give you a dime
 until I see the script,
 I know who's att--Like, I just
 can't get my mind around that.
 Brian, I think you're
 doing this 'cause you can't--
 'cause you're stuck
 And you can't get the money
 any other way.
 Oh, no...
 why? Why should I take
 the risk today?
 (James) Here's the other thing
 that we're all forgetting about.
 This has such a massive,
 built-In audience that--
 You have nothing today!
 Who's still left
 on the executive producer List?
 Uh, we're not--We're out--
 We're already out, guys.
 We're already out.
 Definitely?
 (Daymond) We're out.
 All right.
 All right, you know,
 take it down.
 (Mark) Take 'em off.
 (Robert) Oh, that's funny.
 Ohh... (laughing)
 (Daymond) oh!
 Oh...
 well, I see Mr. Wonderful's
 next on the list,
 so let--Let him speak.
 Yes, sir.
 Please do.
 It is a horrifically bad idea.
 I forbid you to proceed.
 I'm out.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Mr. Wonderful's next.
 (Robert) No!
 (James) He's going...
 (Barbara laughs)
 (James)
 We got Barbara and rob.
 (Barbara) It's a--I'm next,
 I'm next.
 But I can't picture myself
 going home
 and Telling my teenage son who
 I won't let get a motorcycle,
 "I'm financing a film
 on motorcycle racing."
 Scare the crap out of me.
 It's not my kind of thing.
 I'm out.
 Okay.
 Vanna?
 (Daymond and mark laughing)
 "Vanna."
 (Barbara) Take me down.
 Take me on down.
 Okay, hold on
 because now
 this has become an issue.
 And...
 (Robert) What's going on?
 It's going down to you,
 Robert.
 (laughter)
 (Brian) There's
 a producer left.
 (laughter continues)
 You gotta give an "a"
 for showmanship, right?
 That's great.
 You know, Robert--
 and we anticipated this.
 We anticipated this,
 so we figured you'd want
 to be in the race as well.
 You'll be in the movie, so...
 (sharks) Ohh!
 (Barbara) Gotta say yes.
 I know you wanna be
 on the track, in the movie,
 on the bike.
 Look...
 ludicrous concept.
 You're transferring the risk
 completely from you
 to me.
 I can't get there
 without knowing more
 about it.
 Okay.
 Okay. We can do that.
 (Robert) I love racing.
 Yeah.
 "We'll switch our plan
 just like that."
 I can't be involved
 on nothing.
 Okay.
 I have--look, I have...
 so... I'm out.
 Okay.
 Hit it, Vanna.
 Okay, get rid of him.
 (Robert) No! No!
 There--He's out, Vanna!
 (sharks) Ohh...
 good luck, guys.
 Close the cap.
 Thank you, guys.
 Thank you very much.
 Good luck, guys.
 We appreciate it.
 Thank you.
 ??
 You know, I saw this
 exact same deal
 in an e-mail from Nigeria.
 (sharks laugh)
 Next into the tank
 is Mary Beth Lugo,
 with a better way
 to teach kids
 something
 they all want to learn.
 Whoa.
 ??
 and this is my product,
 Kazam.
 I am here today seeking
 $300,000
 in exchange for 20% equity
 in my business.
 and here's why.
 The key to learning
 how to ride a bike
 and what are you
 selling them for?
 We make them for $28.25.
 The wholesale price
 is $45.
 Direct to consumer
 for $99.95.
 and he learned like that.
 (snaps fingers)
 Wow.
 Me made our own design.
 We have a patented frame design.
 (Barbara) What age category
 would be on this bike?
 Maybe 2 1/2
 up to 5, 5 1/2.
 It kind of depends on--
 but I'm curious to why
 this company
 already has been doing this
 in Europe,
 and then they're not
 selling over here
 if it was a-a product
 in demand.
 Actually, we are not
 the only ones now
 in the market
 in the United States.
 Okay.
 But what's different
 about ours
 is the patented
 frame design
 with the foot rest area.
 And...
 tell us about your competition.
 How much are they selling?
 The market's actually
 fragmented right now
 with several small companies
 like ourselves.
 How many?
 Five or six, probably.
 and the year before?
 Last year
 were $611,000.
 In 2010, they were
 $384,000.
 Great growth.
 (Kevin) What do you think
 you'll sell next year?
 Next year we're projecting
 $1.5 million.
 On the million dollars,
 what will your profit be?
 The profit margin is
 about 36% to 37%.
 I have a problem
 with your margins.
 They're not enough.
 How do you get them up
 to 45%, 47%?
 Well, right now we're
 in a situation where
 we're doing batch
 manufacturing, which means
 a small quantity
 that we're ordering--
 1,680 bikes...
 do you know how many you'd
 have to buy at a time
 to increase your margins
 by 20%?
 You gotta get them up
 to close to 50%.
 We realistically would have
 to get to about 50,000.
 50--so you've got a ways
 to go then.
 Fantastic growth.
 If it maintains this way,
 you're gonna suck up
 a lot of cash.
 Mm-hmm.
 The only way to get
 some relief from that
 is to enhance these
 margins dramatically.
 And that's what I don't like
 about your deal.
 Because, for me, it's
 how do I get my money back?
 I'm not gonna take
 that chance.
 I'm out.
 Okay.
 And let me just say this--
 This is not limited
 to toy and bicycle.
 This bridges to education,
 preschools,
 daycares,
 occupational therapy.
 Have you gone back
 to the european market,
 And they just ordered
 a container F.O.B.
 Okay, so you're talking about
 raising $300,000.
 What else would you use
 the money for?
 We'd actually like to create
 an--another product.
 We want to have
 the 2-Wheeled bike
 as the next step up
 from the Kazam,
 for the "Kazam Graduate."
 (Robert) A pedal bike?
 A pedaled bike.
 Why would you do that?
 Do you know how competitive
 that is?
 (laughs)
 That is.
 You can buy a bike
 for $39.
 That's true, but with
 a quality product
 and the fact that we've
 created a loyal customer--
 I forbid you to do that.
 And I'm out.
 and then start competing with
 a huge market
 with huge competitors.
 Why would you do that?
 Well, and I'll tell you why--
 Because we get asked
 all the time
 from our retailers,
 "When are you coming out
 with something new?"
 we want to build
 a brand--
 Yeah, you're, you know,
 you're gonna drown
 in opportunity.
 Entrepreneurs make
 that mistake every day.
 Just because somebody asks
 doesn't mean you should do.
 I commend you on the sales.
 You made a great argument.
 I mean, you've answered
 all the questions really well.
 It's just a personal thing.
 I wouldn't buy one.
 I'm not saying
 that's good or bad.
 You gotta have somebody along
 for the journey
 who really believes in it.
 Um... I'm not that guy.
 I'm out.
 (Daymond) Uh, I think you have
 a great concept here,
 but if I gave you my money,
 I would feel like
 I would never get it back.
 I'm out.
 Mm. Okay.
 What I'm concerned about
 is I don't see your competition
 as being only
 the tricycle market.
 It's the tricycle market,
 the training wheel market.
 It takes a lot of money
 and Real high focus.
 I'm wondering--
 You have a very mild manner.
 Are you the type of person
 that could do that?
 Really? I'm surprised
 you said that. (laughs)
 I just don't feel
 that fire in you.
 Listen, I'm the one
 that's running
 the day-to-day operations.
 I could picture you
 as organized, but again,
 even in that answer, I don't
 feel that fire coming out.
 Are you willing to pour boiling
 oil over your competitors?
 (laughter)
 (Mark) Yeah.
 That's what she's asking you.
 In a nice way.
 Are you saying
 she's not aggressive?
 I'm not sure.
 I'm here because
 I want to blast them away.
 I want to emerge this company
 as the Leader in this market.
 Barbara's right.
 When you get a chance
 to step on the throat
 of your competitor,
 you just gotta step, squish...
 gosh.
 And let the roadkill be
 picked up by somebody else.
 You give articulate answers,
 nice and steady as you go,
 but I'm looking
 for that thing, that heat!
 You're right. I'm a shy person.
 I'm a reserved person.
 But I have spent
 every day
 of the last three years
 working on this
 because I know
 it's a proven concept.
 I know that we can be
 the Leader.
 And I want to be
 that person
 who is poised and ready
 to enter the mass market
 when that time comes.
 You know what? I'm gonna--
 I'm gonna find out just how much
 killer you have in you.
 I'm gonna make you an offer.
 $300,000
 for 40%...
 (Kevin) Ouch!
 Okay?
 (Daymond) Ooh.
 But it's contingent
 on you convincing Barbara
 to come in with me.
 Three sharks are out.
 And I'm gonna give you
 24 seconds to convince Barbara,
 so you're going to have to
 come high and Come hard,
 and we'll find out just
 how aggressive you are.
 (Daymond) Let's go.
 and I work until 11:00 at night
 every single day.
 This has become my life.
 And I am not willing
 to walk away from it
 until we become
 the top leader.
 I'm sold. Mark, I'm in.
 Do we have a deal?
 (exhales)
 (Kevin) 40%.
 40% is high!
 It'll be worth it.
 40% is too high.
 We valued our company
 correctly,
 and I'm definitely
 confident in that.
 Then come back and make
 a counteroffer.
 Could we do 32%?
 ??
 Okay, okay, okay.
 $300,000 for 32%,
 Barbara and I partnering
 together,
 and we come in and we make
 Kazam huge.
 Do we have a deal?
 We have a deal.
 Amen.
 (Daymond) All right.
 (Barbara) Nice.
 (clapping)
 I'm proud of you.
 (laughs)
 Thank you.
 A big hug.
 Awesome. Thank you.
 You got better
 as you went.
 Exactly.
 Barbara, you hurt
 my feelings.
 I love you!
 I wanted to hurt
 your feelings!
 I wanted
 to hurt your feelings!
 Thank you.
 I need to take one of these
 home for jakers.
 Jake's gonna love it.
 I never thought insulting
 people was the way to go,
 but you brought something
 out of her.
 That's--She's a snake.
 Who?
 Barbara.
 (laughter)
 I can't believe this.
 I can't believe this.
 It's a dream come true.
 It's what I've been
 working for for so long--
 for the last three years.
 This is going to be
 the big break.
 ??
 Earlier this season,
 Cheryl Rigdon
 failed to get a deal
 with the sharks
 for her makeup tool,
 the Spatty.
 I think we're all in love
 with you.
 It's just too early for us.
 Let's see what she's
 up to now.
 ??
 Even though I didn't
 get a deal,
 I haven't given up
 on the Spatty or Spatty Daddy.
 Oh, you saw us
 on "Shark Tank"?
 before "Shark Tank," I only
 sold 15 Spattys.
 After "Shark Tank,"
 through my web site,
 I've received pre-orders
 for 7,000 Spattys.
 At one point, I had to stop
 taking orders for the Spatty
 because I was completely
 sold out.
 Sales from my product
 have reached $32,000.
 You know, it might not seem like
 a lot, but that's huge to me.
 Well, I can't wait
 to see it.
 And with that money,
 I've been able
 to take my handmade
 prototype
 into a mass-produced product
 at a real factory.
 There you go. Is that what
 you were looking for?
 Yes! That is awesome!
 I'm really proud to say
 that I'm building this company
 on my own.
 When the sharks said
 they didn't have time
 to build a company
 from the ground up,
 I didn't understand that then,
 but I understand it now.
 (laughs)
 It was great talking
 to you, too, Daymond.
 Thank you.
 In the tank, Daymond offered
 to help commit me to people
 in the beauty industry.
 Not only has he done that,
 but he's worked with me
 to help me find
 a licensing deal.
 "Shark Tank" was definitely
 the catalyst
 to get my business
 off the ground.
 Company's doing great,
 and, you know, the future's
 looking really bright
 for the Spatty and Spatty Daddy.
 ??
 Next up are Lance Yabut
 and Tom Kanemoto
 with a way to make every party
 more memorable.
 And my name is Tom Kanemoto.
 We're seeking $300,000
 in exchange for 10% equity
 in pink shutter photobooths.
 We've taken the fun
 and nostalgia
 of the old-fashioned
 photo Booth
 and turned everything
 on its head.
 We're revolutionizing
 the entire industry.
 Have you guys ever tried
 to take a family picture,
 to only have them come out
 stiff and boring?
 With a super-fun
 pink shutter photobooth...
 (Robert chuckles)
 You won't even have to beg
 your kids to smile.
 Our pink shutter
 photobooths
 are some of the most premium,
 high quality,
 and luxurious photo booths
 in the nation.
 Unlike other cramped
 photo booths,
 our spacious booth
 means more people,
 more poses, and more fun.
 You can just imagine
 how interesting
 those pictures get
 as the night wears on.
 Only you won't have to
 imagine it,
 because not only do your guests
 get a high-Quality
 printout to take home,
 but you get a copy
 of all the pictures.
 Whoo-Hoo! Memories
 to last a lifetime.
 (laughing)
 So, sharks, enough talking.
 Let's get ready
 to have some fun.
 Come on down, pick a prop.
 (both) It's party time!
 Hey! Why not?
 Whoo!
 Let's go. Come on down.
 Come on down, guys.
 So, uh, we got a nice--
 a lot of cool props for you
 guys to choose from.
 So go ahead,
 put your props on...
 Oh, I love that.
 Whenever you pick them out.
 We knew that was for you.
 You guys are--
 It's definitely for me.
 Oh, there you go.
 Daymond, I feel like
 this one is for you.
 You got me, like...
 (laughter)
 Oh, yeah, baby.
 Money.
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.
 Get in here.
 Look at this guy.
 Wow.
 You gotta hold this.
 (laughter)
 (Robert) hang on.
 Get in here, mark.
 Get Cuban in here.
 Let's squeeze it in.
 Get in here.
 All right, hit it.
 (man) Nice.
 (Daymond) Cheese!
 (shutter clicks)
 (indistinct conversations
 and laughter)
 We own and distribute
 all of our photo booths
 across many different
 locations.
 Currently, we're open
 in Sacramento, Los Angeles...
 thank you.
 And Las Vegas,
 San Francisco...
 Look at Daymond.
 And San Diego.
 (laughter)
 So do you own
 all the equipment?
 Yes.
 We own all the assets in
 the company, free and clear.
 How big, money-wise,
 is this business today?
 Well, in our first
 fiscal year,
 we pulled in about
 $195,000.
 In our second fiscal year,
 we're in our first quarter,
 and we've pulled in
 $135,000 already.
 Guys, look. Photo booths
 are ancient.
 What makes you guys
 different?
 Well, what makes us different
 is that we've cut
 the overhead costs
 from most photo booths.
 Most photo booth companies
 can only service events
 if they're making
 $1,000 per event,
 because it's a huge setup.
 So how much does each
 setup cost you, all in?
 It costs us about $3,500
 in equipment
 and about $500 labor
 to actually build the booth.
 (Robert) How are people
 finding it?
 As you go to a new market,
 how do I know you're there?
 Well, we have strategic
 partnerships already set up
 with the largest deal sites
 on the internet--
 Living Social and Groupon.
 So, are there any competitors
 that are doing
 the same thing you're doing?
 There are--There are a few
 competitors out there.
 We're not gonna lie.
 There's a lot of competition.
 So what is--Okay, so what's
 your secret sauce,
 or why are people coming
 to you?
 Well, one of the big things
 that makes us different
 is most photo booth companies
 that are out there
 are mom-and-pop shops
 that are more than happy
 to just be contained
 in that one area.
 I could find a couple of guys
 with pink shirts and black ties,
 buy some photo equipment,
 advertise in a few cities,
 and crush you
 like cockroaches?
 I don't--
 'cause that's the question
 you have to answer.
 That's the thing
 that matters to me.
 Now we're talking
 real money.
 This is not worth $3 million.
 You know why?
 There's nothing that's
 proprietary about it. Nothing.
 $3 million's a joke.
 I'm out.
 But we're making money.
 Last 30 days of sales--
 $83,000.
 This fiscal year, we're slated
 to make $500,000
 with no capital infusion.
 And what will your profit
 be on that?
 60%.
 Why do you need the money?
 We don't need the money.
 We have great credit.
 We have--We have banks
 that... (speaks indistinctly)
 I'll be your partner
 for no money. No problem.
 We need the strategic
 introductions.
 You guys paid yourself yet?
 Um, I currently do
 take a salary.
 What do you take?
 I'm taking $99,000.
 I know these don't
 sound like a lot, but...
 oh! Wait a minute.
 And the company made
 $300,000, correct?
 $333,000.
 So you took 30%
 out of the company already?
 No, not yet. No, I just
 started taking a salary
 just two, three months ago.
 Okay, so you're gonna
 pay yourself $100,000.
 What are you gonna pay
 yourself?
 I haven't really
 thought about it yet.
 No, no, no. Come on.
 Don't play possum with me.
 He's getting $100,000.
 Okay.
 What are you gonna
 pay yourself?
 Same.
 Same.
 So $200,000.
 $200,000 in salaries
 already, right?
 There's nothing wrong
 with that.
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.
 $200,000 in salaries, and you
 just took $300,000 from us.
 Okay. Can you generate
 $200,000 in sales?
 I believe so.
 Okay. You just
 made your money back.
 Yeah.
 No, that's not right.
 Guys, here--Here's
 the challenge.
 All you've done is shown
 everybody
 that there's a unique
 market out there,
 and while they may not be
 as good as you,
 you've set the price
 for your service,
 and the fact that there's
 huge margins
 for someone to come in
 and undercut you.
 For that reason,
 I'm out.
 You don't need the money,
 but yet you want $300,000.
 You're gonna pay each other
 $100,000 apiece.
 Only offering us 10%.
 Wanting us to go out
 and work for you.
 $300,000 is a lot of money.
 That is a lot of money...
 (speaks indistinctly)
 Right?
 I'm out.
 Thank you.
 Lance and Tom have one offer
 on the table from Barbara,
 and Mark may have had
 a change of heart.
 My money's getting cold here,
 what do you say?
 But wait.
 Before you say yes...
 hang on.
 Wait, you're out, mark.
 No, I-I can come back in.
 No, you're not.
 There's no law that says
 I can't come back in.
 What do you say, guys?
 At that valuation,
 I'm far more interested.
 I don't care
 about necessarily
 getting my money out
 immediately.
 I care about the growth.
 What I would do is
 do a deal comparable
 to Barbara--
 $300k for a third--
 But wouldn't take
 anything back
 until your sales hit
 a million dollars, so...
 that's only one year.
 Yeah, one year.
 Well, it's one year or two year,
 but at least you get there.
 I can get you to
 the event organizers.
 I have a company called
 axs tv
 that broadcasts
 live concerts,
 and we're partners
 with Aeg,
 setting them up
 at festivals.
 Branding it as axs tv,
 and having it there,
 the challenge
 is going to be
 we'd have to move
 incredibly fast,
 simply because I think
 competition is a huge risk.
 So I'll let you pick.
 W-Well, um,
 so you said
 you're gonna bring us
 into the concert industry.
 Right.
 And then, Barbara, what will you
 be bringing to the table?
 I'm gonna bring to the table
 exactly what I do
 for every one of my successful
 entrepreneurs.
 I'm gonna bring
 my marketing expertise.
 I'm gonna bring everything
 I know about business.
 Okay.
 I'm gonna be there
 when you need it.
 You're just going to get
 a real working partner,
 and, believe me,
 there is a difference.
 'cause if you were to speak
 to all of my entrepreneurs,
 that is what
 makes the difference
 between where they are
 and where they went.
 Can we have a minute
 to--to talk it over?
 Sure.
 Okay. Thanks.
 That was a creepy thing to do.
 Absolutely.
 What'd you do that for?
 Because once it became a good
 deal, it was a good deal.
 At $3 million,
 it wasn't a good deal.
 Yeah, but you rode
 on my good deal. Come on.
 I mean, I like
 both of their offers.
 You know?
 I mean, she's...
 $100,000!
 That's a lot of money.
 You should know better.
 You should know that I'm
 the better partner,
 and you know it, mark.
 Actually, you set it up,
 Barbara, I'll give you credit,
 but they're crazy--
 You'll give me credit?
 They're crazy to pay you
 a $100,000 salary.
 They're crazy!
 ??
 All right, so we actually
 have a proposal for you guys.
 Would you, Barbara and Mark,
 be willing to come in together?
 Do we get to take the salary,
 or which deal is it?
 Without the salary. With--
 Without the salary.
 Oh...
 so our counteroffer
 is $300,000,
 25% equity,
 with Barbara and Mark.
 I want to give you
 a piece of advice right here.
 We all noticed that you were
 about to say yes
 to Barbara's deal.
 Kevin calls this
 the "Bone in the mouth" theory.
 (laughs) Yeah!
 Now you're coming back
 and you're changing it,
 and I'm telling you--
 but--But Mark came in,
 and we feel that, like,
 both of you guys are so good.
Okay, so what is your fi--
 Your final offer is
 you offering a counter--
 That's not our final offer.
 That's our counteroffer.
 Your counteroffer is 25%...
 25%.
 For $300,000, split between
 Barbara and Mark,
 and no salary.
 No salary.
 Okay.
 (Barbara) Here's the thing.
 What I take exception to
 is the deal got worse.
 We had a 33% deal
 on the table,
 and you came back
 and offered 25%.
 We were gonna--Okay--
 Okay, that's a no.
 What do you say, Mark,
 on the percentage?
 Oh, absolutely not.
 Okay, so you have two nos
 on the 25%.
 Guys, I'll make it easy.
 Part of the drill
 in going through this
 is you guys presenting your
 decision-Making process.
 Right? You--
 You weren't definitive,
 and I don't want to be
 in a scenario
 where it's wishy-Washy
 and we're not sure, we like it,
 but we're not quite there.
 I'm out.
 What just happened?
 (Kevin) You know,
 two lab rats left
 the shark tank...
 (Barbara laughs)
 They came back in.
 They got slaughtered.
 I hate it when that happens.
 ??
 What are you going to do?
 All right, Barbara,
 we accept your offer.
 Good deal.
 (laughter)
 'cause you're
 the only one left!
 You're the only one left!
 All right, baby.
 (Kevin) Ahh.
 All right, Barbara.
 Good deal.
 I really believe that you
 will put in the time.
 Yes, I really will.
 All your help
 and everything.
 Good luck. Congratulations.
 Barbara,
 that was really clever.
 Thank you.
 You're getting--You're getting
 the same salary they are.
 Hey, I deserve it.
 We're so happy we're
 working with Barbara.
 She said she's gonna
 put the time in.
 This partnership
 with Barbara,
 it's gonna take us
 to a whole 'nother level
 we've never been able
 to reach before.
