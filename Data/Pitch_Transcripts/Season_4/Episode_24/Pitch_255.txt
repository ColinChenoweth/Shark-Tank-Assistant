 Hi. I'm James Lavitola.
 And I'm Brian Pitt,
 and our project
 is titled "Track days."
 We're seeking $5 million...
 (Robert) Whoa!
 (Daymond) That's
 a lot of money.
 In exchange for 34% equity
 in our production.
 Now, "Track days" is
 a full-length action film.
 I'm out.
 It revolves around
 the exciting world of...
 I'm out.
 A motorcycle
 world championship.
 I'm out.
 (laughs)
 You're so open-minded,
 Mark.
 I'm out. Did I say I was out?
 Again, "Track days" is
 a full-length action film
 that revolves around
 the exciting world
 of a motorcycle
 world championship.
 And what better way
 to make a blockbuster
 than by combining
 one of the largest-Grossing
 movie genres
 with the second-Most-Watched
 sport in the entire world?
 Which is?
 Professional motorcycle racing.
 Now, we went ahead
 and put together
 a little teaser trailer
 for you sharks.
 (Robert) Awesome.
 But no premiere
 would be complete
 without some
 Good old-fashioned
 Now James will be dropping
 you off some premiere gift bags
 'cause we all want a little
 good swag
 when we go
 to a movie premiere.
 Let's start your engines,
 'cause the race
 is about to begin.
 (Robert) Vroom!
 (rumbling)
 (motorcycle engine roaring)
 (engine revving)
 (beeping)
 (revving continues)
 (tires screech)
 (hard rock music playing)
 (thudding and crash)
 (tires screeching)
 (crashing and whirring,
 motorcycles roaring)
 (crashing)
 (tires screech)
 (thud)
 ??
 (motorcycle roars)
 That's it?
 That's it?
 (laughing)
 So, boys, you want 5 million
 bucks to make a movie?
 I know how you feel
 that, you know,
 you think that filmmaking
 is a crap shoot,
 which we completely
 understand.
 However, Brian is considered
 somewhat an expert
 in this field.
 (laughs)
 And with the crap shoot
 statement,
 we're gonna make it
 so that you're the house,
 and the house always wins.
 (mouth full) How are you
 gonna do that?
 Brian?
 Happy to explain it
 to you.
 We're gonna be bringing you
 a packaged product
 that has, uh...
 efficient foreign sales,
 Efficient, uh,
 distribution.
 Efficient or sufficient?
 Sufficient.
 Essentially, what we'll
 be doing is we'll be
 putting a-a script
 together,
 which is in the process
 of being rewritten.
 You don't even have
 a script yet?
 We--
 we have the story.
 We have the story.
 We specifically decided
 to go a different
 route with this--
 me and my buddies get pitched
 stuff all the time.
 Absolutely.
 And we invest sometimes
 in movies,
 But nobody ever comes Along
 and says,
 "Give me money
 and then we'll do the work."
 They pitch the script.
 We say...
 absolutely.
 "We like it,"
 "We don't like it."
 "Who's the producer?"
 that is
 the traditional thinking.
 We're gonna educate you...
 correct.
 On the new way that films
 are financed,
 to where you guys aren't
 risking your money.
 (Barbara) So we don't
 put in money?
 We don't want you to risk
 your money.
 Often, what happens is,
 people go out
 and they put a script together
 and they get an actor,
 and then they come to a company
 like the one I used to run,
 where we would finance
 films.
 Do you have an actor?
 No. By design
 we don't have an actor.
 Specifically don't have
 an actor attached.
 Okay, so I know mark is--
 I know mark is already out--
 We're getting him back in.
 He's coming back.
 I've heard this story
 many times before.
 Yes.
 Um, I executive-produced
 "The Crow."
 Yes, we know that.
 (Kevin) You make any money?
 It became a horror flick in
 regards to making my money back.
 (laughter)
 So... I'm out.
 (Robert) This is a record.
 Now--
 This is the fastest two guys
 have ever dropped out.
 We're gonna get them back in.
 We're gonna get you back.
 We are gonna put together
 a package
 that you won't spend one dime
 until we show you
 foreign sales,
 domestic sales,
 distribution deals,
 product placement.
 You know, the film business
 is a bit of a chicken
 before the egg.
 You can make it happen
 if you have the money.
 You can make it happen
 if you have
 the best script in the world.
 You can make it happen
 if you have
 the best actor in the world.
 You know,
 and you can make it happen
 if you're the right people.
 Why would we have
 confidence in you
 and give you $5 million?
 What's your background?
 So, film-wise, I've been
 in the business
 for about 12 years or so.
 I've been head of production--
 Head of physical production
 for a--for a very
 successful indie company.
 We secured a 9-picture
 distro deal
 with a major studio.
 We've produced eight feature
 films that went theatrical.
 And...
 how many--How many did you
 make money on?
 We grossed well over
 $200 million.
 "Mr. Brooks" is one
 that did fairly well.
 It was Kevin Costner,
 Demi Moore, uh, Dane Cook.
 Did a movie
 called "Waiting..."
 that did
 very, very, very well.
 And what about you, James?
 What about you?
 What's your background here?
 Uh, when I was younger,
 I was on Broadway.
 I came to L.A., did stunts.
 You know, I'm a huge
 motorcycle fan.
 And there's been such a lack
 of movies made about them.
 (Robert) I have an issue
 with the subject matter.
 Yes, sir?
 You don't have an actor.
 (James) We have a story.
 What happens to my cash--
 What we wanna do
 is take your money,
 put it into let's say
 an escrow account
 or some kind of interest-bearing
 account
 to where we can't touch it.
 At that time, we can go and put
 the package together for you.
 We'll have a list of ten actors
 that fit the leading roles--
 So can't start the project
 until people know...
 until you approve of everything.
 That the cash is there?
 We will not start the project
 until you're happy
 with the calculated risk
 that you would have to take.
 Because it would be
 very minimal.
 Otherwise, we don't do
 the movie.
 Guys, let--Let me try
 to help you out.
 When you take a movie,
 and you have money behind it,
 then all the people you're
 pitching to think you're real.
 You're using our money
 as bait, basically?
 Correct.
 Yes, absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah. Absolutely.
 The movie business--
 It's the worst business
 I've ever seen in my life.
 But it can also be a very
 lucrative business.
 I can't give you a dime
 until I see the script,
 I know who's att--Like, I just
 can't get my mind around that.
 Brian, I think you're
 doing this 'cause you can't--
 'cause you're stuck
 And you can't get the money
 any other way.
 Oh, no...
 why? Why should I take
 the risk today?
 (James) Here's the other thing
 that we're all forgetting about.
 This has such a massive,
 built-In audience that--
 You have nothing today!
 Who's still left
 on the executive producer List?
 Uh, we're not--We're out--
 We're already out, guys.
 We're already out.
 Definitely?
 (Daymond) We're out.
 All right.
 All right, you know,
 take it down.
 (Mark) Take 'em off.
 (Robert) Oh, that's funny.
 Ohh... (laughing)
 (Daymond) oh!
 Oh...
 well, I see Mr. Wonderful's
 next on the list,
 so let--Let him speak.
 Yes, sir.
 Please do.
 It is a horrifically bad idea.
 I forbid you to proceed.
 I'm out.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Mr. Wonderful's next.
 (Robert) No!
 (James) He's going...
 (Barbara laughs)
 (James)
 We got Barbara and rob.
 (Barbara) It's a--I'm next,
 I'm next.
 But I can't picture myself
 going home
 and Telling my teenage son who
 I won't let get a motorcycle,
 "I'm financing a film
 on motorcycle racing."
 Scare the crap out of me.
 It's not my kind of thing.
 I'm out.
 Okay.
 Vanna?
 (Daymond and mark laughing)
 "Vanna."
 (Barbara) Take me down.
 Take me on down.
 Okay, hold on
 because now
 this has become an issue.
 And...
 (Robert) What's going on?
 It's going down to you,
 Robert.
 (laughter)
 (Brian) There's
 a producer left.
 (laughter continues)
 You gotta give an "a"
 for showmanship, right?
 That's great.
 You know, Robert--
 and we anticipated this.
 We anticipated this,
 so we figured you'd want
 to be in the race as well.
 You'll be in the movie, so...
 (sharks) Ohh!
 (Barbara) Gotta say yes.
 I know you wanna be
 on the track, in the movie,
 on the bike.
 Look...
 ludicrous concept.
 You're transferring the risk
 completely from you
 to me.
 I can't get there
 without knowing more
 about it.
 Okay.
 Okay. We can do that.
 (Robert) I love racing.
 Yeah.
 "We'll switch our plan
 just like that."
 I can't be involved
 on nothing.
 Okay.
 I have--look, I have...
 so... I'm out.
 Okay.
 Hit it, Vanna.
 Okay, get rid of him.
 (Robert) No! No!
 There--He's out, Vanna!
 (sharks) Ohh...
 good luck, guys.
 Close the cap.
 Thank you, guys.
 Thank you very much.
 Good luck, guys.
 We appreciate it.
 Thank you.
 ??
 You know, I saw this
 exact same deal
 in an e-mail from Nigeria.
 (sharks laugh)
 Next into the tank
 is Mary Beth Lugo,
 with a better way
 to teach kids
 something
 they all want to learn.
 Whoa.
