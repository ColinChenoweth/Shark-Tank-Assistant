(Robert) Wow.
Wow.
It's sink...
you're telling me
you can't
control your own destiny.
Or swim...
this girl served 15 months
in Afghanistan for you.
So...
wow.
While you were making money!
Who are the sharks?
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold
his first internet companies
for over $350 million.
Seven years?
(Robert) seven years?
Yeah.
We went from selling
$37,000 worth of scones
in '07
to selling $60,500
in '08
to selling $113,000
in 2009.
I'm just--I'm not
a big scone guy.
I could tell. (laughs)
Um, but when I
walk into a whole foods today,
My name is Robert Gifford,
(Robert)
My wife tolerates my hobbies.
Like all good invention,
it comes from a wife's ire.
My wife was irritated
by the... (speaks indistinctly)
That was sprinkled
around her home.
I realized I should fix it
if I want to remain married
so I did.
Yeah, we can do all of that
in walnut.
All right.
Talk to you later. Bye.
Since I launched my business,
we've been doing very well.
I need an investment
from the sharks
because I need more capital.
It's the kind of problem that
kills businesses all the time.
Hi, my name is Robert Gifford,
(Robert) Can I see it?
(Lori) Yeah, I was gonna say--
uh, one of our maps.
(Robert) Oh, look at this.
That thing--
Yeah, that just comes out.
That would be--you could have
that full inset
for playing cards on.
What does this cost?
Uh, about $3,500,
I would say.
Wow, that's reasonable...
Mm-hmm.
For this quality.
How many sales do you have?
We did $2 million
in sales last year.
Wow.
Th--Yes.
Impressive.
What was your profit?
We were negative.
We were in the red by $100,000
on $2 million.
Whoa.
We know what furniture
manufacturers are worth.
5 times free cash.
Sure.
You don't have any free cash.
Why are you worth $2 million?
I'm worth more
than $2 million.
The $2 million is what we did
in revenue last fiscal year.
So what are your projected
cash flows for this year?
Um, I believe that our projected
is about $400,000 or $500,000.
Robert, do you want to sell this
to a lot of people
or do you want to stay
very niche-oriented,
make very high-end stuff,
maybe grow to $10 million,
see, that--That's where
I disconnect, Robert.
Robert, let me, uh,
let--Let me tell you where
I differ with your vision...
that you want to be
a big furniture guy.
I don't want to be
a big furniture guy.
I want to be
a big company.
I buy into the design,
but I don't buy into
the furniture company
part of it.
I'm out.
Okay.
I have a story
about biology class...
(laughs)
That may be relevant to this.
(laughs)
okay.
I remember once
counting fruit flies
in a petri dish
with a microscope.
(laughs) I can't
picture that.
(Robert) So, Robert,
you're raising your value.
You've gone from
$2-Million value on the company
to 3.3.
Robert, hang on a sec.
Are you considering his offer?
No. No, I'm--I'm--
I'm countering with a diff--
All right. I'm gonna have to
stay firm on that offer.
My ticket to enter
Yeah, then it comes down
to a "Yes" Or "No," Robert.
We're great partners, man.
You're 75%. I'm 25%.
Be true to yourself.
Robert, I'll give you
more cash.
But Robert may have had
a change of heart.
Robert, I'll give you
more cash.
I'll give you $300,000
for 25%.
My vision
is slightly different.
Robert made you an offer
for $300,000 for 25%,
valuing your company now
at $1.2 million.
Pee-Wee the fruit fly,
what are you gonna do?
Could you--could you bring
your offer up
to match--To match
Robert's offer at this point?
I cannot, because my time
is worth...
because your time is--
I-I--that's fair.
That's completely fair.
Uh, so..
I'm s--Thank you, Daymond.
Really, I appreciate
what you're-- what you're doing--
You taking out
the buzz saw now?
You want 25% of my company,
but then again, you said
you don't get geek,
Robert, um...
I thought you were out.
That's the beauty
of the shark tank.
Anything can change.
Robert,
I'd like to accept
your offer.
Let's do this. We're gonna
make a lot of money.
You got a deal.
We're gonna make
a lot of money.
We sure are.
Thank you, Robert.
Beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you.
You just partnered
with a termite.
Hey, listen, listen...
(sharks laughing)
He's gonna be good for me.
You could've been
good for me, too.
(Lori and Robert laugh)
It's a fable.
I think you definitely suck,
Robert.
You stole that one from me.
Oh, I feel really good
about that one.
I feel good. I feel good.
I hope that this is gonna be
a great partnership
and that, uh, Robert--
The two Robert geeks
will unite
to form
a-a more powerful entity.
Earlier this season,
Aaron Krause
made a deal with Lori Greiner
for his high-tech
scrubbing tool Scrub Daddy.
It won't scratch
any of your surfaces,
but it will
clean them beautifully.
I'm pretty confident
that we could
get this into retail stores
within literally weeks.
Let's see what he's up to now.
(Lori and Robert laugh)
(Robert) Wow.
(Lori laughs)
(Robert) Wow.
(laughs)
So we started a jewelry line
Unlike any other
(Robert) Wow, guilt trip.
You cannot back out on us.
(Kevin) Oh, I love it.
I love it.
Please don't.
Mark? Lori?
There's your vice president
of sales right there.
Come on.
Listen, I have to be honest,
but I really just don't like
the jewelry. I'm out.
Lori.
Come on, Lori.
Mark. Come on.
I think there's something
very interesting here.
I love your story.
I love the combination
of all of it together.
Everybody in our country
cares so much about all of you
that have fought for us,
