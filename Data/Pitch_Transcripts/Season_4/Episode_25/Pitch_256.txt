Hey, sharks. I'm Paige.
And this is my sister
and business partner Ashley.
Our company
is called Stella Valle,
and we are here today
seeking $150,000
for a 25% stake
in our company.
When we were West Point Cadets
and army officers,
we never got used
to looking like this
when what we really wanted
to look like was this.
(sharks laugh)
Wow. I'm joining the army.
Just like Paige and I,
the line was designed
to perfectly marry masculine
and feminine characteristics.
We have major retailers
like Bloomingdale's
and Henri Bendel,
along with numerous boutiques
selling our line.
We've proven that our product
is marketable
on a small scale,
and now need the capital
to grow Stella Valle
into a global brand
reaching many retailers.
We have faced adversaries
much tougher than a shark.
We are ready to meet
a business partner
as determined as we are
to grow the Stella Valle brand
as strong
as the U.S. Army.
Very nice.
Wow. Great presentation.
(Lori) Wow.
Thank you.
You were officers...
Yes. Yes.
In the army, both of you?
So proud of you.
Where did you serve?
I was in Afghanistan
for 15 months.
Oh, my God.
You are amazing.
Wow.
So impressed.
Thank you.
Tell us about your start
of the company.
Ashley and I actually
got out the same exact week
out of the military,
and we knew that we wanted
to be businesswomen
and we wanted to start
a company together.
We started out small
and We just continued
to grow our business,
because we reinvested every
single dollar that we've made--
What are your sales like?
How much have you sold of this?
Our total sales to date
is about $75,000.
Over what period of time?
So last year was
our first full year of sales,
and we did about $37,000.
But we're projected this year
to sell about $80,000.
So are you currently in
Bloomingdale's and Henri Bendel?
We recently just had two
really successful trunk shows
in Bloomingdale's
and Henri Bendel.
What--what's a trunk show?
A trunk show is where
the store asks you to come up
and set up your stuff exactly--
sort of like we have here,
and we would stand there
as designers
and just talk to
the end customer about our line,
show them how it works, um--
Did Bloomingdale
pick it up then?
The national buyer was
so impressed with our sales,
she does not doubt that we could
triple, if not more, our sales.
And she's confirmed
three additional trunk shows
for, um, our brand.
Why would they keep asking you
to come back and do trunk shows
and simply not pick it up
and distribute it
throughout Bloomingdale's?
They're testing.
They're taking you broader.
Right.
Right.
They're trying to see
how people are reacting--
'cause they're not sure.
Well--
What are the average prices?
Retail, our products range
anywhere from $50 to $375.
Okay.
Can we look at them?
I'd love to see them.
Absolutely.
Which one of you
is the designer?
I actually do more
of the creative work,
um, but we collaborate
on the design.
We kind of pass things
back and forth
and then, uh, decide
on our collection.
We basically have
three collections here,
so our first collection
was all create your own,
and you actually can unscrew
all of these charms
so that the customer
can create their own.
So buy extra ones
and put 'em in?
That's looks good on you, Lori.
(laughs)
I'm liking this.
What--What are your costs
for your $50 item
all the way up
to your $375 item?
$3 to $45 per piece.
Your $3 cost items you sell
retail for how much?
Uh, $96.
Sorry. Your retail is $96,
and you make it for $3?
Yes.
That's unbelievable margin.
Do you see most of your sales
in the future
coming from each
of your collections,
or build your own where
somebody has to be present
to help the people?
We're asking for $150,000,
and we did that for
a very specific reason.
What we wanna do is to, um,
take the idea
of the trunk show
And, uh, replicate it
across many different stores.
Why do you even need
to go there?
Why do you need to do
trunk shows?
If--If Bloomingdale
likes the sales,
why wouldn't they just pick
it up, sell it nationally?
They probably will.
Eventually they will.
That's what we've been told.
This is--
I see this absolutely
in a store like Bloomingdale's
or Bendel.
What does this sell for?
$375 retail.
Yeah. $375.
(Kevin) $375.
We made it for $49.
$49. Wow.
It's all Swarovski Crystal.
So basically this is
very expensive
costume jewelry, right?
We have so many people
that come in here,
trying to sell jewelry.
The tank is full of jewelry,
but yours is different
because of where you came from.
(Lori) Mm-hmm.
Right.
Well, here's the bad news.
You're not worth $600,000.
We think we are.
So...
I don't think so.
And we've based that off
of what we've made in the past,
and also the opportunities
that we have--
You haven't made
anything yet.
We've made $75,000
in revenue.
In sales.
Exactly.
(Mark) ignore him.
You know what, guys?
At some point, you just have
to look at somebody
who just doesn't get it
and say, "Next?"
So just ask him,
"are you in or are you out?"
(Ashley and Paige laugh)
So the question is, you haven't
made any money yet, have you?
If we can replicate
ten trunk shows
across any retailer,
worst case scenario,
we sell $500 a day revenue,
we will generate in 60 days
$300,000.
I can't get to your $600,000
valuation right now.
I would never give you $150,000
for only 25%.
To me, that's what
the whole thing's worth today.
I'm out.
What's your logic
for replicating yourselves
as opposed to just
trying to get the big order
in Bloomingdale's
or other retailers?
We think we have to get
the name out there
before you can just put it
on a shelf
and people are coming in there
for Stella Valle.
We don't have
that brand recognition yet.
One of the hardest things
to build is a brand.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
I'm not sure I agree
with the strategy.
I'm out.
Just to talk to that point
a little bit, though.
When we got into Henri Bendel
and Bloomingdale's,
they didn't know our story.
We went into an open call
and stood in line
with 500 other designers,
and we went,
and we showed our designs
to the buyer of Henri Bendel,
and they loved our designs.
They didn't know anything
about Ashley and I yet.
And we are the brand,
and I think if we
can get our story
out there,
people will come seeking
our jewelry.
Paige and Ashley, I think
it's--It's an amazing story,
but, um...
we both have
business degrees.
We're ready to run
the company.
We just need the money,
and that's what
we want from you.
(Kevin laughs)
And the connection.
And--And any connection
you have.
Listen, you're--You're very...
I'm gonna have to close
my eyes a minute,
'cause you're gonna convince me,
which I don't want
to be convinced.
Daymond, this girl served for 15
months in Afghanistan for you.
All right.
Come on.
For your freedom...
(laughter)
So... ah--
while you are making money!
You cannot back out on us.
Two sharks are out,
and Paige and Ashley
are trying to convince Daymond
not to become the third.
Daymond,
we know that you can.
I'm gonna have to close
my eyes a minute,
'cause you're gonna
convince me,
which I don't want
to be convinced.
Daymond, this girl served
15 months in Afghanistan
for you.
All right.
While you are making money...
um...
she's getting shot at.
Come on.
Um, and Ashley actually
mentors a wounded soldier.
I love these girls, Mark,
and I think that there is
something special here.
I think the jewelry
is great-looking.
I think that we could
design even more things
that could be this cool, edgy,
powerful kind of jewelry
from your background.
You can't pay $600,000
for this.
But, Mark... would you like
to go in with me?
I think that we can...
all together make this is a hit.
Do you see this
as a QVC product?
I think it could be, yes.
See, I-I actually like
the fact that it might not be
a QVC product.
I think they need everything,
Mark.
My gut feeling
is you need stores.
I think QVC would give you
free advertising
and get your name
and your brand out there,
and you can create
special pieces just for QVC.
I think there's a lot
that could be done with it.
There's a lot to it.
Especially with how proud
we are of your background.
I think that story
is really powerful.
Um, mark,
if you go in with me...
Mm-hmm.
Maybe 30% of the company.
I'd rather put in
a little bit more cash
and get a little bit more
of the company than 30%
because if there's
two of us,
there's gotta be enough
skin in the game.
And for what it's worth,
I started an organization
called
the Fallen Patriot Fund.
It's something I believe in,
so what if we both put up 100k--
$200,000 for 40% of the company?
That way, you have more cash,
you have more expertise,
and we both have enough skin
in the game.
I think $150,000 is where
we should stick
at 30 or 35% of the company.
We'll do 150k for 35%, okay?
Lori and I together.
I'm on that deal, Mark.
By the way, You'd be insane
not to take that.
We don't want any more talking,
right?
So what are you gonna do?
Mark and Lori,
we accept your offer.
All right.
Yeah.
(Lori) Great.
Thank you.
(laughs)
It's done.
Great.
(Mark) Good, good.
(Daymond) Ohh.
Yay!
(laughs) Thank you,
thank you. Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Congratulations.
(Lori) You're awesome.
(Kevin) Wow.
To think that we started
our business with a $1,000 loan,
and now we're business partners
with Mark Cuban
and Lori Greiner, this--This is
a dream come true for us.
