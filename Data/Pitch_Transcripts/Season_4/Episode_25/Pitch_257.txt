(Robert) Wow.
Wow.
It's sink...
you're telling me
you can't
control your own destiny.
Or swim...
this girl served 15 months
in Afghanistan for you.
So...
wow.
While you were making money!
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Lori Greiner,
the queen of QVC,
holds over a hundred patents
and has launched
over 300 products,
grossing over
a half a billion dollars
in retail sales.
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
and branding expert
who grew his homemade
clothing line
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu.
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold
his first internet companies
for over $350 million.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious
billionaire entrepreneur
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.
Seven years?
(Robert) seven years?
Yeah.
We went from selling
$37,000 worth of scones
in '07
to selling $60,500
in '08
to selling $113,000
in 2009.
I'm just--I'm not
a big scone guy.
I could tell. (laughs)
Um, but when I
walk into a whole foods today,
My name is Robert Gifford,
and I live
in Lynnwood, Washington,
with my wife
and two beautiful daughters.
And my business is called
Geek Chic.
I would describe myself
as a geek.
Any blow to this road
is 7 points of damage.
Ohh.
I'm obsessed with all
the normal geek things.
I have dozens of pocket squares,
80-plus bow ties,
hundreds of hats,
and 30,000 comic books.
Managing that
is kind of the reason
that the business was born.
1-5. Yes!
Please make sure that everything
gets put back where it belongs
and don't leave this
on the table.
(Robert)
My wife tolerates my hobbies.
Like all good invention,
it comes from a wife's ire.
My wife was irritated
by the... (speaks indistinctly)
That was sprinkled
around her home.
I realized I should fix it
if I want to remain married
so I did.
Yeah, we can do all of that
in walnut.
All right.
Talk to you later. Bye.
Since I launched my business,
we've been doing very well.
I need an investment
from the sharks
because I need more capital.
It's the kind of problem that
kills businesses all the time.
And this is too good a business
to not go forward.
To geeks
finally being cool, huh?
(man) Yeah.
Hi, my name is Robert Gifford,
and my company is Geek Chic.
I'm here to offer
5% of my company
for $100,000.
So I'm a geek.
But as a geek, I am compelled
to define that nebulous word.
A geek is simply someone
who's obsessively curious
about one or more topics.
Now it's this obsession
that leads us to become
successful scientists,
engineers,
software moguls.
We bring that same obsession
to our hobbies
and entertainment.
Board games, video games,
action figures,
even comic books
are bought mostly by adults.
(sighs deeply)
So...
(laughs)
My wife tolerated my games
on the dining table,
my controllers in baskets
on the coffee table,
and, uh, white cardboard boxes
invading our lives
on comic wednesdays.
But I could see
that it aggravated her,
and in a rare moment
of marital insight...
(bell chimes)
I realized
that she deserved better.
So I started designing
beautiful, geeky furniture
that would be at home
in our home.
But then I had
a more startling revelation--
that we all deserve better.
Well, and that's where
geek chic comes in.
This is a black walnut
3X5 emissary dining table,
but like many good things geek,
it's more than meets the eye.
So if I reach back
down here,
with the push of a button,
I reveal a second surface.
This surface can be used
for card games
or board games
or anything you want to do,
in progress or in storage.
If I pull out of this drawer,
it becomes a desk,
and the desk
is good for laptops
or for running
a role-playing game.
We also have this rail
that we can attach accessories
like bins
and counter holders,
and even wineglass holders.
(snaps)
the configuration
just opens up.
Geeks, by accident or design,
are shaping the world,
and Geek Chic is the brand
that's going to design
and shape it with them.
So, sharks,
and hopefully geeks,
what do you need to know
to become a part of geek chic?
(laughs)
Is this your only product
or do you have more products?
No, no, we have--
This is one of, uh,
19 pieces of furniture
that we currently offer.
(Robert) Can I see it?
(Lori) Yeah, I was gonna say--
So they're all tables
and cabinets at the moment,
or are there also chairs or--
We do chairs as well,
absolutely.
Oh, this is really cool.
And this is the desk?
Yep.
Wow. Very clever.
Do you customize them,
what's inside here?
So it could be a poker table,
it could be a crap table,
it could be...
right.
Whatever you decide to order?
Yeah, absolutely.
That's what--You're seeing
two examples there.
There's a wet-dry-erase surface
that's over,
uh, one of our maps.
(Robert) Oh, look at this.
That thing--
Yeah, that just comes out.
That would be--you could have
that full inset
for playing cards on.
What does this cost?
Uh, about $3,500,
I would say.
Wow, that's reasonable...
Mm-hmm.
For this quality.
How many sales do you have?
We did $2 million
in sales last year.
Wow.
Th--Yes.
Impressive.
What was your profit?
We were negative.
We were in the red by $100,000
on $2 million.
Whoa.
We know what furniture
manufacturers are worth.
5 times free cash.
Sure.
You don't have any free cash.
Why are you worth $2 million?
I'm worth more
than $2 million.
The $2 million is what we did
in revenue last fiscal year.
So what are your projected
cash flows for this year?
Um, I believe that our projected
is about $400,000 or $500,000.
And what are you gonna use
the $100,000 from us for?
Well, I'm gonna use it
to probably buy a truck
to expand
our shipping operations
and probably put on--
Get some more machinery
in the facility
to increase our efficiencies.
What is your average order?
Uh, our average order's about
$4,000, $4,500.
So how much are your margins,
then, on that table?
Uh, about--Well, this is about
$1,800 to make a $3,500 table.
So about 50%?
Yes.
The furniture manufacturing
sector
has been decimated in America.
Yes.
It's all in Asia now.
Why are you staying alive?
Why are you not a dead geek?
Because I am not trying
to compete with China.
China does what they do
very, very well.
But they aren't gonna
be able to make
North American
fully hardwood furniture
in the same kind of way
at a competitive level.
They can't do that.
(Lori)
I-I think you're great.
I love your enthusiasm.
This is a beautiful table,
really beautiful.
I've seen
a lot of tables similar.
I'm just not sure
how you're gonna get
the competitive edge
on top of them
because some of them
are very high-end.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Robert, do you want to sell this
to a lot of people
or do you want to stay
very niche-oriented,
make very high-end stuff,
maybe grow to $10 million,
and just keep it at that?
This company's gonna be
a lot bigger than $10 million.
And we--I want to sell it
to a lot more than--
Than just geeks.
Everyone's looking at this
and going,
"Man, that is nice.
I really do want--I want that.
That's something"--
see, that--That's where
I disconnect, Robert.
I look at that and say,
"That's a table," you know?
I don't--I don't see
anything more there.
Do you see the functionality,
though? Do you see it, Mark?
Do you see that--that--
That's the part--
that part of this is,
is about describing
very specific function
for people?
I mean, I see
what you're trying--Look...
this may not be for you--
for me to get into a business,
I've gotta be relentless
and dive in.
This sounds like you're
trailing down to "No, sir."
Yeah, I'm just telling you...
think about it for a second.
If--if it was Geek Chic
in another direction...
I--this--
but furniture?
I'm--That's just not me.
I--geek furniture is
the beginning
of what we're doing.
It is absolutely the beginning
of what we're doing.
Well, when you get
to the rest of it...
give you a call?
Give me a call,
but I'm out.
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Robert, let me, uh,
let--Let me tell you where
I differ with your vision...
that you want to be
a big furniture guy.
I don't want to be
a big furniture guy.
I want to be
a big company.
I buy into the design,
but I don't buy into
the furniture company
part of it.
I'm out.
Okay.
I have a story
about biology class...
(laughs)
That may be relevant to this.
(laughs)
okay.
I remember once
counting fruit flies
in a petri dish
with a microscope.
(laughs) I can't
picture that.
And after doing about
a hundred of them
with my little tweezer,
I found one that was not black.
It was white.
It was clear white.
And I held it up
for the teacher and I said,
"What is this doing with
the rest of my fruit flies?"
and he said,
"That's an anomaly."
You're that fruit fly.
You're the anomaly.
You're in
a really crappy business,
who got decimated over
the last 20 years in America.
But if you try and become
a furniture company,
You'll be like
all the other fruit flies--
Dead in the petri dish.
That's what I believe.
I don't think you should
raise any money
or give up any equity.
You should just be
a happy fruit fly.
I'm out.
Okay.
Four sharks are out.
Oh, yes, Daymond.
I just don't know if we're
gonna have the same vision.
If you do this geek angle,
I just don't know
if I can ride with that.
But I real--I'm in love
with the stuff,
and I'm--I'm in love with how
you're running the company.
You asked for $100,000
for 5%?
You're right.
I'm giving you an offer
of $200,000... (exhales)
for 25%.
Now I-I mostly made the offer
at $100,000 for 5%
because I was, you know,
counting the value
that any shark could bring
to my business, for sure.
Uh, how about...
uh, $500,000 for 15%?
(Robert) So, Robert,
you're raising your value.
You've gone from
$2-Million value on the company
to 3.3.
Yes, and I still think that
that's probably undervalued.
Now I'm finding a flaw
in your character.
You see, you came in here
and you offered that--
not a flaw in my character,
sir.
Robert, hang on a sec.
Are you considering his offer?
No. No, I'm--I'm--
I'm countering with a diff--
All right. I'm gonna have to
stay firm on that offer.
My ticket to enter
is my time and $200,000
and 25%.
Uh, 25%--It's--
25% is Still too high.
Yeah, then it comes down
to a "Yes" Or "No," Robert.
We're great partners, man.
You're 75%. I'm 25%.
Be true to yourself.
Robert, I'll give you
more cash.
But Robert may have had
a change of heart.
Robert, I'll give you
more cash.
I'll give you $300,000
for 25%.
My vision
is slightly different.
I gotta tell you, when you have
something beautiful and rare,
you can charge more for it.
Did you just jump in
on my geek?
I sure did.
He did.
(Kevin) Well, let's summarize
what you've got here.
Daymond made you an offer
of $200,000 for 25%,
valuing your company
at $800,000.
And while you were whining
about that,
Robert made you an offer
for $300,000 for 25%,
valuing your company now
at $1.2 million.
Pee-Wee the fruit fly,
what are you gonna do?
Could you--could you bring
your offer up
to match--To match
Robert's offer at this point?
I cannot, because my time
is worth...
because your time is--
I-I--that's fair.
That's completely fair.
Uh, so..
I'm s--Thank you, Daymond.
Really, I appreciate
what you're-- what you're doing--
You taking out
the buzz saw now?
You want 25% of my company,
but then again, you said
you don't get geek,
and you don't
really understand it...
yes.
And that--And I think that's
probably not--
That's probably not
a good fit.
I told you, our vision
may not be on course.
That's a decision
you have to make.
I think maybe that's--That's
probably not a good idea.
Robert, um...
I thought you were out.
That's the beauty
of the shark tank.
Anything can change.
Robert,
I'd like to accept
your offer.
Let's do this. We're gonna
make a lot of money.
You got a deal.
We're gonna make
a lot of money.
We sure are.
Thank you, Robert.
Beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you.
You just partnered
with a termite.
Hey, listen, listen...
(sharks laughing)
He's gonna be good for me.
You could've been
good for me, too.
(Lori and Robert laugh)
It's a fable.
I think you definitely suck,
Robert.
You stole that one from me.
Oh, I feel really good
about that one.
I feel good. I feel good.
I hope that this is gonna be
a great partnership
and that, uh, Robert--
The two Robert geeks
will unite
to form
a-a more powerful entity.
Earlier this season,
Aaron Krause
made a deal with Lori Greiner
for his high-tech
scrubbing tool Scrub Daddy.
It won't scratch
any of your surfaces,
but it will
clean them beautifully.
I'm pretty confident
that we could
get this into retail stores
within literally weeks.
Let's see what he's up to now.
(Lori and Robert laugh)
(Robert) Wow.
(Lori laughs)
(Robert) Wow.
(laughs)
So we started a jewelry line
Unlike any other
to encourage individuality
and self-expression.
Even though this army fatigues
camouflage our creativity,
we had a clear vision
for our life after the military.
It was time for us to leave
conformity behind,
and Stella Valle was born.
It's an accessories line
that reflects our
innate sense of style
and our unique background.
(Robert) Wow, guilt trip.
You cannot back out on us.
(Kevin) Oh, I love it.
I love it.
Please don't.
Mark? Lori?
There's your vice president
of sales right there.
Come on.
Listen, I have to be honest,
but I really just don't like
the jewelry. I'm out.
Lori.
Come on, Lori.
Mark. Come on.
I think there's something
very interesting here.
I love your story.
I love the combination
of all of it together.
Everybody in our country
cares so much about all of you
that have fought for us,
and I think
there's something there.
This being jewelry that's...
for women with power,
but I also think, you know,
in my mind,
if a percentage of the proceeds
went to the military...
we actually designed, um,
a screw
in the create-your-own,
which is a star,
and it's engraved "U.S.A."
and we donate a portion
of the proceeds
to the Wounded Warrior Project.
