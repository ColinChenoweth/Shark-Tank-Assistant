Hi. My name is Brian Altomare,
and I'm from New York.
My company is Lugless,
Brian, hasn't this been done?
It's called Fedex.
(Lori) Mm-hmm.
It has.
Fedex does do shipping.
But not like us.
Okay, what's the difference?
The difference is, is that
we have a proprietary system
customer service--
"Hey, Brian, where's my bag?"
it's--right now it is.
It's a premium service
that's going to slowly get
more to the masses
when the baggage fees continue
to remain where they are.
Appreciate it.
Good luck, Brian.
Thanks.

I don't think they understood
that it's not
just about the price,
it's not just about
the network,
that it's about the industry
