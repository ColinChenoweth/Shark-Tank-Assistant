Hi. My name is Brian Altomare,
and I'm from New York.
My company is Lugless,
and I'm here asking
for $100,000
for 10% equity.
Sharks,
people are tired of paying
ridiculous airline baggage fees,
tired of lost luggage,
and tired of T.S.A.
pilfering through their luggage.
So are we.
That's why we've solved
these problems forever.
Introducing Lugless--
A door-to-door
luggage shipping service
that picks up your luggage
from your home, office, or hotel
and sends it to wherever
you're going ahead of time.
And when your trip is over,
we'll pick your luggage
right back up
and send it on home for you.
We send luggage
to over 200 countries
365 days a year.
We sleep, eat, and breathe
luggage shipping.
Our mission is to be
the voice of reason
in a world gone mad
with baggage fees
and bring back
the joy of traveling
for millions of passengers
who deserve
a better travel experience
with or without
a first-class ticket.
Brian, hasn't this been done?
It's called Fedex.
(Lori) Mm-hmm.
It has.
Fedex does do shipping.
But not like us.
Okay, what's the difference?
The difference is, is that
we have a proprietary system
and we have
service flexibility.
Sorry. Sorry.
Fedex--
Fedex, $40-Billion company,
I believe, last year,
they don't have anything
proprietary or a service--
of course they do. I probably
shouldn't have led with that.
Most importantly
is service flexibility.
Some of the differences--Let's
talk about price real quick--
Is any express or international,
we're 20% to 60% less
than if you went directly
to Fedex.
'cause your bulk buying?
We're bulk buying.
We have deep discounts.
Okay, so walk me through it.
Okay, so let's say, Mark,
you're going to new York...
okay.
For an upcoming Mavericks,
uh, knicks game.
Right.
All right. Um, your private jet
is in the shop,
so you have to fly commercial.
Whoa.
Oh, my--
That's not gonna happen,
so go ahead.
You don't want to lug
your bag
and you want it waiting for you
at your hotel when you arrive.
Perfect.
Right.
So first you go online,
sign up
in less than five minutes.
And then...
you receive a packet
from Lugless at your door.
You open it up...
and you place the reusable
plastic luggage tag
on the handle of the suitcase
that you're sending.
Okay, well, there's--
There's a red flag right there.
How long does it take for me
to get the--the package?
Overnight.
So you can't help me
right now?
Absolutely.
You don't need this packet.
If you don't want it
and you need it out that day,
we have drop-off locations
or we can schedule
a private pickup with, uh,
one of our couriers.
So, you know,
we have a big company,
so we have
our own Fedex account.
Sure.
So you're gearing it
towards individuals.
We are, but we're also
gearing it towards corporations
and companies--
You're saying
you could ship my stuff
cheaper than I could with Fedex.
Uh, I'm gonna say, even though
you have a large company,
we have
very competitive rates.
You have to ship somebody
a package first,
so that's a cost.
Yep.
Sometimes you have to have
a local delivery service
come there,
and then you still have the main
shipping of the luggage.
How do you add
all that in there and it's--
You're still cheaper
than Fedex or U.P.S.?
Well, for those--
Those are add-ons,
and those are
for those customers
that want a little bit more
white-glove service
and they're willing
to spend that.
What did you sell last year?
This year, $215,000 so far,
to date. 10 months.
That's gross or your net?
In revenue.
That's gross.
Net is around $70,000 so far.
Have you tried to partner
with airlines,
saying that
this is more convenient,
and give them a piece
of the action?
Not at this point.
We're trying to partner with
travel-related companies--
Travel agents, hotels--
Well, what's more travel related
than an airline?
Well, they're--
(Lori) Travelocity--
they're collecting $3.4 billion
on baggage fees, so right now--
Yeah, but, you know, they're
aware of what you're doing.
They know what Fedex is doing.
They may consider you
to be an ally
if you gave them
a piece of it.
I-I think it's a great idea.
We just haven't led with that
because we're focused
on hotel chains,
travel agents,
uh, concierge services,
uh, travel portals.
That's really our market.
So am I correct--
You're in
the problem-solving business?
I have my golf clubs.
I call you.
A guy comes,
puts 'em in whatever,
takes care of 'em,
they show up.
I don't have to do anything.
Nothing.
It's all handled.
So it's a--
It's a premium service.
It's not geared towards somebody
who cares about cost.
Am I right?
No, you're wrong. Right now,
with the baggage fees,
second, third, and fourth bags
sometimes is more expensive
than what we charge,
especially for the--
What do you charge for...
sure.
An average-Size suitcase?
Sure. So this--
Like point to them.
This would be carry-on.
That's $39 flat rate,
anywhere in the U.S.
Um, the standard bag,
that's $59.
Uh, this let's say oversized,
that would be $99.
Surf Board's $149.
Uh, and then golf clubs
are $89.
(Mark)
But you're not--You're not
the only luggage shipping
service that's available online.
Absolutely not.
We're the best brand,
and we're definitely
the fastest growing.
(Kevin) The question is,
how do I value this business?
How do I know that...
for $100,000, I shouldn't be
getting 60% of it?
We have a lot of partnerships
that are pending.
I have a letter of interest
from a company called
secure wrap.
And what do they want to do?
They want to put, um,
our Lugless kiosks
that we'll--We'll have
next to them
in, um, in the airports
with them.
So they package your bag,
and they want us to be with them
to fulfill service for them
in their 53 airports.
We'd get business there...
but...
and We'd also--
Why couldn't they just
create an account with Fedex
and do the same thing?
They don't want to get
into the logistics of it.
They don't want
to worry about
if there needs to be
a private courier,
which is one of the levels
of service
that makes us different.
They don't want to do it.
They want it--
so let's say--Let's say
this comes to fruition.
Right? You've gotta
set up a kiosk right there
and hire employees to be there
all the time.
You're gonna have to--to pack
and ship a whole lot of luggage.
We're--We're actually,
I mean, the kiosk idea
is as simple
as just a tablet, uh,
where you can sign up--
but then someone--Then someone's
gotta deal with
getting your courier
or whoever
to take it
to wherever it needs to go.
I-I don't see it
any more than a premium service.
Because it's not gonna be
less money than the airlines.
When you add the local courier,
a guy picking it up,
customer service--
"Hey, Brian, where's my bag?"
it's--right now it is.
It's a premium service
that's going to slowly get
more to the masses
when the baggage fees continue
to remain where they are.
And you're--You're incorrect
by saying We're more expensive.
We're not.
We're cost effective and--
but I don't--
I don't see it.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
The model kinds
of reminds me of what happens
in the cellular telephone
market.
A new brand carrier
like a virgin
sits on top
of the infrastructure
of another company,
and sells
for very thin margins.
You're doing the same thing
on top of Fedex.
I think
what happens over time is,
maybe you scale,
but your margins get crushed.
I think that's the challenge,
because anybody can do this.
And I'm not saying you won't
as you run
for building this brand.
I've never heard of Lugless.
I travel a lot.
I personally, if I owned
a piece of this company,
would push for an airline deal.
I'm out.
(mouths word)
You're asking for $100,000
for 10% of the company.
So you're saying that
the company's worth
a million dollars.
Um, why is that?
I'm asking that for
a couple of different reasons.
Uh, one is the system
that we've created.
If you did what we did on
the open market and created it,
it's about $200,000,
$250,000.
Then we have these partnerships
that we're talking about.
You have that contract already?
No, because we have hotel chains
that we're speaking with,
their looking for
a fully integrated
Lugless operation.
I got it. I-I understand.
Um...
I'm out.
Thank you.
I love
your entrepreneurial spirit.
And I do think
it's a good idea.
But for me,
the problem is,
you're up against too big
a fish right now.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Mark?
You know, I typically like
software plays like this
that are scalable.
Um, but...
you have one huge,
huge problem.
You've got other competitors
that are bigger
and have more
marketing strength than you do.
You're gonna get crushed.
You need an angle
that differentiates you
and just smacks people
in the face--
Quick, easy, cheap, now.
And I don't think you've come
close to doing that,
and you didn't give me
any indication
that you're going to do that,
so I'm out.
All right.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Good luck, Brian.
Thanks.
(exhales)
I don't think they understood
that it's not
just about the price,
it's not just about
the network,
that it's about the industry
and that this is
a growing industry.
