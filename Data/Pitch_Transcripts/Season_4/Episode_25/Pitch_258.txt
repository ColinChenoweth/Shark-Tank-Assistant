First into the shark tank
is J. Jones,
an American who believes
he has perfected
a traditional English Treat.
Hi, I'm J. Jones
from Denver, Colorado,
my company is Jones Scones.
Let me tell you
why Jones Scones are awesome--
It's because they're authentic.
(Robert)
J., why is it so dry?
Is that on purpose?
Our scones
tend to be more moist.
If you're experiencing
a dryness,
I find that
to be unusual.
Scones are on
the drier side.
They're not like
a muffin. More like a biscuit.
Are scones typically
a breakfast food?
Yes.
They are.
J., what are you selling
in terms of the scone?
Are the... are the scones
selling cash?
Yes. Uh...
how much?
We are selling right now
$5,000 worth of scones a month.
(Lori) a month.
A month.
Yes.
Why are your scones better
than the other
typical scones?
Well, number one,
that cream style
that we talked about.
Number two,
they're all natural.
So we found a home
in Whole Foods.
You're in Whole Foods?
One store, right?
(laughs) No.
We're in--We're in
six stores now,
uh, in the Denver/
Rocky mountain region,
over the course
of the life of the business.
What happened, J.?
Well, uh... (laughs)
This is why we're here.
This is not good.
Is this a bad story?
No, it's not a bad story,
'cause I'm here.
All right. Tell us.
do I see
only Jones Scones
or do I see multiple
manufacturers of scones?
People have
done scones locally.
Nobody has gone
into the scones category
and said, "Hi, I'm Jones."
You know what, man? J.,
you are such a likeable person.
Um, I just don't like it.
Well, let me continue
on--on how...
you don't
have to with me. I like...
I like you, but...
I'm out.
Okay.
We looked at what we can sell
the scones for.
Whole foods, actually,
each store Sells
$368 worth of scones
selling 12 cases a month.
That says we're gonna have
about a quarter of
a million dollars in sales.
Potential. But here's
the reality that I see--
You've been in business
for ten years.
Your sales in the last three
have actually declined.
Lots of potential.
Tell me what you've learned
in the last few years
that when you wake up tomorrow,
it's gonna be a different day
than it was in the past.
Team. That's the next part.
Team.
I've got a guy that can guide me
with what I'm doing.
That's bull crap.
What you're telling me,
without any uncertainty
whatsoever,
is you can't control
your own destiny.
I-I hate to agree with Mark,
but I agree with him 100%.
You're looking for answers
from people outside of yourself.
I hate when people
tell me
the answer to my salvation
is a consultant.
Yeah. No kidding.
No, I'm--I'm not
looking for a consultant, guys.
But you are.
That's what you just said.
Wait, no, he just said
his "Team." His "Team."
But every one of you
has a team.
Every one of you
has somebody that you rely on.
But now you make
the final decisions.
Here's the thing, though--
When I hear you say
that you've been ten years
in the business,
Well, J.,
here's how I see it--
I agree with you.
Nobody wins without a team.
But I don't have time to be
part of that overall team.
I wish you all the best,
'cause you're a very nice guy.
But I'm out.
Mr. Wonderful?
You know, I don't get
emotionally involved.
The scones are good.
I eat scones.
But there's nothing proprietary
about making a scone.
All there is
is executional excellence.
