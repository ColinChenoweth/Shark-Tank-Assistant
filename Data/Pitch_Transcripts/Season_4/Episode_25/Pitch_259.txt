First into the shark tank
is J. Jones,
an American who believes
he has perfected
a traditional English Treat.
Hi, I'm J. Jones
from Denver, Colorado,
my company is Jones Scones.
And I'm asking for $100,000
for 25% of my company.
Let me tell you
why Jones Scones are awesome--
It's because they're authentic.
They're just like the scones
you would find in England,
and not the cardboard,
icing-covered copies
that you find
in some coffee chains here.
Now I started making scones
for the usual reasons,
and that's pretty much
England and women.
When I lived in England,
I was there for school
and some other adventures.
I fell in love
with my local bakery's scones.
And when I came home
to go to law school in D.C.,
I could not find a scone
that did not taste
like compressed sand.
So mama taught me how to bake.
I made a scone.
And I would make them
for friends,
they helped out
when I was dating.
So I put my law career on hold
and I dove in headfirst.
Had no capital.
I was delivering scones
in my jeep.
So I have some scones
for you to try.
Some blueberry.
Blueberry?
That's blueberry.
Thank you.
How about you, Lori?
What do you want?
All right. I'm a chocolate girl.
Is there a chocolate?
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Is that blueberry up there?
It's blueberry.
Hey, save me a blueberry.
You want a blueberry?
Yes, sir.
Mark, you can share
half mine.
That's what's up right there.
(Robert)
J., why is it so dry?
Is that on purpose?
Our scones
tend to be more moist.
If you're experiencing
a dryness,
I find that
to be unusual.
Scones are on
the drier side.
They're not like
a muffin. More like a biscuit.
Are scones typically
a breakfast food?
Yes.
They are.
J., what are you selling
in terms of the scone?
Are the... are the scones
selling cash?
Yes. Uh...
how much?
We are selling right now
$5,000 worth of scones a month.
(Lori) a month.
A month.
Yes.
Why are your scones better
than the other
typical scones?
Well, number one,
that cream style
that we talked about.
Number two,
they're all natural.
So we found a home
in Whole Foods.
You're in Whole Foods?
One store, right?
(laughs) No.
We're in--We're in
six stores now,
uh, in the Denver/
Rocky mountain region,
and in Utah.
Why can't you get
all the stores?
We were. And, uh, might as well
kick into the sales talk.
At one point,
we were selling
$113,000 worth of scones
a month.
We sold
a half-million of these
over the course
of the life of the business.
What happened, J.?
Well, uh... (laughs)
This is why we're here.
This is not good.
Is this a bad story?
No, it's not a bad story,
'cause I'm here.
All right. Tell us.
What we did was,
we expanded.
We went from Denver
out to California,
and we picked
a new manufacturer.
Terrible mistake.
I was not able
to oversee my co-packing
the way I should have.
And when I had to correct
that mistake,
we didn't have
the capital to fix it.
We had to pull back,
so sales came back down
to $75,000 last year--
Or 2 years ago,
and $65,000.
So they didn't manufacture
good product for you,
was that the problem?
They didn't do it right.
You couldn't oversee it,
so you couldn't
come in and test it...
it's not their fault.
It's my fault. I should have
been out there more
to watch the product.
And frankly, I should have
been talking to people like you
before I expanded, because
we would have had the capital
to maintain the ground
that I worked so hard to earn.
Are those same stores now
willing to give you
another chance?
Yes. We know that in Denver,
and we believe so
in California.
How long have you been
in the Denver Whole Foods,
and how many times
have they reordered?
Seven years.
do I see
only Jones Scones
or do I see multiple
manufacturers of scones?
People have
done scones locally.
Nobody has gone
into the scones category
and said, "Hi, I'm Jones."
We've got a brand. We've got
someone you can attach it to.
So it's a fragmented market.
You're trying
to become the brand.
Absolutely.
Yeah, but after six,
seven years
of around $60,000,
one year popped to $130,000...
what will $100,000 do that
will be so magical this year?
We are going to
hire food brokers,
which is the way to get
our sales force out there.
The biggest cost that we have
is feeding people the scones.
You know what, man? J.,
you are such a likeable person.
Um, I just don't like it.
Well, let me continue
on--on how...
you don't
have to with me. I like...
I like you, but...
I'm out.
Okay.
We looked at what we can sell
the scones for.
Whole foods, actually,
each store Sells
$368 worth of scones
selling 12 cases a month.
That says we're gonna have
about a quarter of
a million dollars in sales.
Potential. But here's
the reality that I see--
You've been in business
for ten years.
Your sales in the last three
have actually declined.
Lots of potential.
Tell me what you've learned
in the last few years
that when you wake up tomorrow,
it's gonna be a different day
than it was in the past.
Team. That's the next part.
Team.
I've got a guy that can guide me
with what I'm doing.
That's bull crap.
What you're telling me,
without any uncertainty
whatsoever,
is you can't control
your own destiny.
I-I hate to agree with Mark,
but I agree with him 100%.
You're looking for answers
from people outside of yourself.
I hate when people
tell me
the answer to my salvation
is a consultant.
Yeah. No kidding.
No, I'm--I'm not
looking for a consultant, guys.
But you are.
That's what you just said.
Wait, no, he just said
his "Team." His "Team."
But every one of you
has a team.
Every one of you
has somebody that you rely on.
But now you make
the final decisions.
Here's the thing, though--
When I hear you say
that you've been ten years
in the business,
and you're where
you are right now,
needing
to ask us for money,
it tells me
something's wrong.
There's some reason
why this isn't taking off.
I'm not sure what that is.
I thought the scone was fine.
But for me,
I need to love the product
and feel passionate
and want to eat it constantly.
And I'm not at that place.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Sorry to hear that.
What else
can I answer for you?
How can--How can
I bring us closer?
Well, J.,
here's how I see it--
I agree with you.
Nobody wins without a team.
But I don't have time to be
part of that overall team.
I wish you all the best,
'cause you're a very nice guy.
But I'm out.
Mr. Wonderful?
You know, I don't get
emotionally involved.
The scones are good.
I eat scones.
But there's nothing proprietary
about making a scone.
All there is
is executional excellence.
And on that test,
you failed once.
Doesn't mean
you can't recover.
But cutting your sales in half
in a commodity business
like scones is never good.
Look, this is about money.
And I can't make any
from what I see. I'm out.
Well, I have to thank you
for your time.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Cheers.
And I'm out. (chuckles)
Mark never said
he's out?
Mark never said
he was out? (laughs)
I gave him a little quickie.
I gave him
a little quickie.
(laughing) That's a first.
Bye. (laughs)
He gave up.
Something new every day.
Oh, my goodness.
