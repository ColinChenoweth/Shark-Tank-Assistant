with an AFTERSCHOOL business
  inspired by Ryan's best friend.
(laughs)
Ryan's barkery.
We are asking
  for an investment
of $25,000 in exchange
  for 25% of Ryan's business.
Thank you, Ryan.
(Barbara) Wow, great job.
  (Kevin) Thank you, Ryan.
They're so cute!
Thank you.
  (Robert) Barbara.
Thanks, Ryan.
I've never eaten
  a dog biscuit.
Mmm.
  Now, Ryan, where you
  making these today?
In our kitchen at home.
When do you do it, after you
  finish your homework at night?
On weekends?
  No.
Early before school,
  like at 5:00.
5:00 in the morning
  you get up to bake these?
  Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Good for you, Ryan.
  (Barbara) Wow.
You have any siblings
  that help you out?
Uh, yeah,
  my older brother Nick.
What do you sell--What do you
  sell the bags for, Ryan?
$4 a bag,
  with 8 treats in each.
Ryan, have you made any
  attempts to grow the business,
to grow--To sell more bags?
Um, we've tried to sell
  at the supermarket...
  uh-huh.
But... I don't think
  it worked out so well.
What happened?
  They were very receptive
  to having them.
We quickly found out
  that it was better to take out
any middle man, to get
  the product directly to the dog.
Ryan, are you selling them
  any other way?
Are you selling them
  through the community?
Like, we'll bring them
  to lacrosse Practice
Ryan, how much money did you
  put into the business,
What did mom invest?
  How much do you
  owe me, Ryan?
$200.
  (laughs)
Yeah, have you guys
  made a profit?
  Yeah.
Why haven't you
  paid your mom back?
Because we just
  keep on baking them,
(laughs)
  Hey, Ryan, where do you
  see the business going?
I see, like, stores, um,
  with my treats in them,
Ryan, you know what
  Mr. Cuban's gonna say to you?
If you're a real businessman,
you have to quit school
  right now...
No, you know what I would
  tell you, Ryan?
I'm gonna tell you exactly.
  My first business
I started when I was
  12 years old.
Ryan, when I was 11 years old,
I couldn't even dream
  of owning my own business.
  (Ryan chuckles)
the reason I started my business
  is somebody
much later on in life fired me.
Ryan, so where I grew up,
  it was, uh...
Yeah, Ryan!
  (Robert) No kidding.
Way to take it to 'em.
Ryan, very few 11-year-Olds
  get on "Shark tank."
You're a very lucky guy.
  Mm-hmm.
Here you are. It's not
  a business yet. It's a Hobby.
Nothing wrong with that.
A Hobby you make money at
  is a good thing.
But if you really want
  to turn this into a business,
you got a long road ahead.
  Yeah.
Good luck to you. I'm out.
Thank you.
I'd love to make you
  a full price offer
for exactly what you're asking--
  $25,000 for 25%,
because I think this has
  the potential to be
a very big business quickly.
(Robert) Wow!
  (daymond) Ryan,
  I want you to--
Ryan, do you really want Barbara
  at your 13th birthday party?
  (laughs)
(Barbara) I'm not coming
  to your party.
  I think Barbara's being
  very generous.
Ry-Ryan, don't listen.
  Don't listen to them.
(Kevin) Listen, don't listen
  to any of this.
  (mark) No, all I'm saying--
Buy a leather jacket,
  take the money, buy a car.
(Robert) Ryan, you--
  (laughter)
Gotta say yes or no, guys.
You want it? Yes or no?
  Is there anything
  to think about?
(laughter)
  We have a deal.
Aah!
  Yeah, there you go!
All right.
  Ya-Ha!
Congratulations, Ryan.
What a cutie.
  (Robert) way to go, Ryan.
Yeah!
I am so proud of you.
Why didn't you guys bid on that?
Barbara has
  a great track record...
okay.
  With foodie-Type
  products.
Yes.
  A compliment.
  At last, a compliment.
I have a business. This is
  gonna be something amazing.
I can't wait to see it
  in every dog store there is.
Me llamo Ryan Frankel.
Did you get what he said?
He said,
  "My name is Ryan Frankel."
(laughs)
  Me llamo kunal sarda.
  Nosotros somos Los Fundadores
de verbalizeit.
  Whoa!
Ryan, walk me through
  how it works.
I download the app.
Do I call
  international 1-800 numbers?
Yes.
  Correct.
Your call is Routed directly
  from our virtual call center
So, Ryan, how do you pay them?
  So, first of all,
let's go to the traveler.
  Kevin's traveling.
Does he pay you
  to download the app?
The app is free, so anyone
  who goes to the App store
See, Ryan, mark loves
  to hear himself talk so much
that when he's quiet,
I know there's something
  going on.
Guys, I'm--I'm gonna make
  this easy for you.
I've made several investments
  in language.
One of the challenges is,
  no solution has everything.
Human translators
  sometimes don't fit
for very verticalized
  applications,
because you can't hit 'em all
  fast enough
or find the right people.
Machine language--
  vice versa.
So when you go
  into big commercial accounts,
it'd be a huge bonus
  to have both.
So, what I'm willing to do,
without hearing
  any of these guys,
because that's just
  a waste of time...
is $250,000 for 25%,
  yes or no?
(kunal) So what do you think?
Some good offers
  on the table.
It's a little bit low--
  Lower than what we wanted.
I wouldn't mind going
  with, um,
