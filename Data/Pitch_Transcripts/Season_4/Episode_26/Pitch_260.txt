with an AFTERSCHOOL business
  inspired by Ryan's best friend.
(laughs)
Hi. I'm Ryan, and I'm 11.
(laughs)
  And I'm his mom Daniela.
And this is Barkley,
  my best friend
who inspired me
  to start my company,
Ryan's barkery.
We are asking
  for an investment
of $25,000 in exchange
  for 25% of Ryan's business.
Ryan's barkery bakes and sells
  fresh, all-Natural dog treats--
So fresh,
  they should be slapped!
(laughter)
  If your family is like mine,
then you consider your pet
  to be part of the family
just like Barkley.
After we adopted him,
we went shopping
  for dog treats
and found
  that they smelled horrible.
They couldn't possibly
  taste fresh and be wholesome.
Since Ryan and I share
  a passion for baking,
we consulted
  with a veterinarian
to find out which ingredients
  are good for dogs,
then started experimenting
  in the kitchen.
We didn't stop experimenting
  until we found the flavors
that Barkley
  cannot get enough of.
We made super flavors
  like pumpkin apple,
banana oat,
  and low-Fat cheddar.
Our treats are baked fresh
  with simple ingredients
and no preservatives.
I rode my bike
  to my friends' houses
and did taste tests
  with their dogs.
(laughing)
  Their dogs went crazy
  for our treats.
Look how Barkley reacts.
  (gasps and whispers) a treat.
Look at that.
  (Robert laughs)
I started getting calls
  from PET Owners
asking where they could
  buy these treats,
and that's how
  the barkery was born.
With an investment
  from you,
we could develop our Web site
  and start fulfilling orders
in a commercial kitchen.
We need your partnership
  in order to grow,
because I can't do this alone...
  (Barbara laughs)
And keep up with my homework.
  (laughter)
Thank you for your time.
  We brought some treats
for you to see, smell,
  and even taste if you'd like.
(gasps)
They're human-Grade?
  They are.
Thank you, Ryan.
(Barbara) Wow, great job.
  (Kevin) Thank you, Ryan.
They're so cute!
Thank you.
  (Robert) Barbara.
Thanks, Ryan.
I've never eaten
  a dog biscuit.
Mmm.
  Now, Ryan, where you
  making these today?
In our kitchen at home.
When do you do it, after you
  finish your homework at night?
On weekends?
  No.
Early before school,
  like at 5:00.
5:00 in the morning
  you get up to bake these?
  Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Good for you, Ryan.
  (Barbara) Wow.
You have any siblings
  that help you out?
Uh, yeah,
  my older brother Nick.
And is he getting up
  at 5:00 with you?
Um, no, be--
sometimes when I--
  like lacrosse practice,
and there's an adoption event,
  I'll let him go,
and then he can keep
  some of the money that he makes.
Your older brother's
  working for you?
Yeah.
  That's awesome.
Have you sold any of these?
We've sold
  about 200 bags of them.
What do you sell--What do you
  sell the bags for, Ryan?
$4 a bag,
  with 8 treats in each.
And what does it cost you
  to make one of those bags?
36 cents each bag.
Ryan, have you made any
  attempts to grow the business,
to grow--To sell more bags?
Um, we've tried to sell
  at the supermarket...
  uh-huh.
But... I don't think
  it worked out so well.
What happened?
  They were very receptive
  to having them.
We quickly found out
  that it was better to take out
any middle man, to get
  the product directly to the dog.
Ryan, are you selling them
  any other way?
Are you selling them
  through the community?
Like, we'll bring them
  to lacrosse Practice
and s--Um, give out
  little samples,
because there's a lot
  of dogs there.
And a lot of people
  bought them there
and just kept on repeating.
But did they ever buy them
  again without you there?
Yeah.
  Yes.
At the lacrosse game?
  Because the labels have
  our phone number on it, so...
Ryan, how much money did you
  put into the business,
and Where'd you get
  the money from?
(laughs)
  From my best investor,
of course--my mom.
  (Barbara) How much?
What did mom invest?
  How much do you
  owe me, Ryan?
$200.
  (laughs)
Yeah, have you guys
  made a profit?
  Yeah.
Why haven't you
  paid your mom back?
Because we just
  keep on baking them,
and at some
  of the adoption events,
I give her a lot of the money
  to help pay her back.
(laughs)
  Hey, Ryan, where do you
  see the business going?
I see, like, stores, um,
  with my treats in them,
and the Web site...
  Mm-hmm.
Where people could, um,
  develop orders,
and then we fulfill them.
Ryan, you know what
  Mr. Cuban's gonna say to you?
If you're a real businessman,
you have to quit school
  right now...
(laughter)
  And do this full-Time.
No, you know what I would
  tell you, Ryan?
I'm gonna tell you exactly.
  My first business
I started when I was
  12 years old.
And the reason I started
  my business was because
I wanted a new pair
  of basketball shoes.
And I went door to door
  to door selling garbage bags.
My garbage bag route
  is not all that much different
than what you're doing
  with your treats.
But $25,000 is a lot
  of money,
and with all that money
  comes a lot of responsibility,
and I think it would be
  very, very difficult
for you, while you're
  still in school
and while you're trying
  to balance all these things,
really to put that money
  to work, so...
a-as much as I'm--
  I'm excited for you,
I'm proud of you, um, I think
  you're gonna do amazing things,
but I still have to say
  I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
Ryan, when I was 11 years old,
I couldn't even dream
  of owning my own business.
  (Ryan chuckles)
the reason I started my business
  is somebody
much later on in life fired me.
But to be 11 years old
  and actually go out there
and dream about that--
  That's fantastic.
Look, this is not the business
that I want to invest
  with you in today,
but I think you'll be back.
And for that business,
hopefully I'll be here,
  and we can talk then.
But for this today, I'm out.
Thank you.
Ryan, so where I grew up,
  it was, uh...
people all wanted to be rappers
  and Gangsters and...
when I told my buddies
that I was going to be
  a fashion designer,
they laughed at me.
  But I didn't care.
How do your friends
  feel about this?
I think they're jealous
  now that I'm here.
(laughter)
  They are.
Yeah, Ryan!
  (Robert) No kidding.
Way to take it to 'em.
Ryan, very few 11-year-Olds
  get on "Shark tank."
You're a very lucky guy.
  Mm-hmm.
Here you are. It's not
  a business yet. It's a Hobby.
Nothing wrong with that.
A Hobby you make money at
  is a good thing.
But if you really want
  to turn this into a business,
you got a long road ahead.
  Yeah.
Good luck to you. I'm out.
Thank you.
I'd love to make you
  a full price offer
for exactly what you're asking--
  $25,000 for 25%,
because I think this has
  the potential to be
a very big business quickly.
(Robert) Wow!
  (daymond) Ryan,
  I want you to--
And I think Barbara's making
  you a very generous offer,
but I--
  but what?
I want you to really think
  about what cuban said, though.
You're gonna have to sell almost
  $150,000 worth of cookies
to pay her back.
  Guess what.
You don't have to pay me back
  until your 13th birthday.
  Bar--Barbara, all I want to--
and all you have to do
  is pay me back
$5,000 a year.
By your 13th birthday,
  that's gonna be nothing.
Ryan, do you really want Barbara
  at your 13th birthday party?
  (laughs)
(Barbara) I'm not coming
  to your party.
  I think Barbara's being
  very generous.
I just want you to understand...
  the responsibilities.
The responsibility.
  I think she is a great partner,
but sometimes money just creates
  a bigger problem.
I think you're gonna be
  really good without us.
So I'm out.
Ry-Ryan, don't listen.
  Don't listen to them.
(Kevin) Listen, don't listen
  to any of this.
  (mark) No, all I'm saying--
Buy a leather jacket,
  take the money, buy a car.
(Robert) Ryan, you--
  (laughter)
Gotta say yes or no, guys.
You want it? Yes or no?
  Is there anything
  to think about?
(laughter)
  We have a deal.
Aah!
  Yeah, there you go!
All right.
  Ya-Ha!
I wish I could adopt you!
  Car and college!
  Car and College!
Look at this little guy.
  Let me lift him up.
(Robert speaks indistinctly)
  Whoa! Good job!
Nice job.
  Thank you.
Nice job.
  Never heard a better pitch.
Congratulations, Ryan.
What a cutie.
  (Robert) way to go, Ryan.
Yeah!
I am so proud of you.
Why didn't you guys bid on that?
Barbara has
  a great track record...
okay.
  With foodie-Type
  products.
Yes.
  A compliment.
  At last, a compliment.
I have a business. This is
  gonna be something amazing.
I can't wait to see it
  in every dog store there is.
Me llamo Ryan Frankel.
Did you get what he said?
He said,
  "My name is Ryan Frankel."
(laughs)
  Me llamo kunal sarda.
  Nosotros somos Los Fundadores
de verbalizeit.
  Whoa!
He is kunal sarda,
  and they are the cofounders
of verbalizeit.
Estamos buscando DOSCIENTOS
  CINCUENTA MIL DOLARES
POR QUINCE POR CIENTO
  DE nuestro compañia.
They are seeking $250,000
for 15% of their company.
In case you haven't
  figured it out,
Erica is a translator,
and her job is to help
  people from around the world
talk to each other.
Verbalizeit allows you
  to put Erica
in your back pocket.
Here's how it works.
  With verbalizeit,
you simply register
  at the verbalizeit Web site,
or download the app.
Within 15 seconds, you press
  a button on your phone.
You're instantly connected
  to one of our live translators
around the world.
You tell that translator
  what you need,
place the phone on speaker.
Our translators communicate
  on your behalf.
Every year, millions
  of international travelers
run into situations where
  they cannot communicate
because of
  the language Barrier.
We want to work with you
  to put verbalizeit
in the hands of individuals
  and businesses around the world.
So who's ready to make a deal?
Thank you, Erica.
What's your background?
  Where did you come from?
Uh, kunal and I met
  in business school.
What business school
  did you meet in?
  At Wharton.
Wow.
  (daymond) hmm.
Ryan, walk me through
  how it works.
I download the app.
Do I call
  international 1-800 numbers?
Yes.
  Correct.
Your call is Routed directly
  from our virtual call center
to one of our thousands
  of translators
around the world.
So you're sourcing people
  that have capacity
at that moment,
  anywhere in the world--
if I'm in egypt, if I'm
  in russia, I'm in cyprus,
I need greek--You have
  enough people now sourced
to actually translate for me?
That's what's really
  interesting, Mr. Wonderful.
(sharks laugh)
  We have created
  this global community
of multilingual individuals
who are monetizing on
  their spare time during the day.
This is very interesting,
but I'm trying to figure out
  the business model,
because the key to this is,
  every single time I call,
the guy's gotta be there
  translating for me
30 seconds later.
  Absolutely.
We have 2,000 translators
  already around the world,
and we're live
  in Five languages,
and we can connect your call
  within 15 seconds
of you dialing
  into the system.
  I'm trying to figure out
how you can get
  somebody that quickly
in a language,
  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
It's a great question, sir.
  What we've created here
is a powerful community
  of people around the world
who speak a second language
and want to be able to make
  money during their spare time.
So by virtue of having such
  a large population of people
who want to make money,
your call will automatically
  always be answered.
So, Ryan, how do you pay them?
  So, first of all,
let's go to the traveler.
  Kevin's traveling.
Does he pay you
  to download the app?
The app is free, so anyone
  who goes to the App store
can download it for free
  and try it for free,
See, Ryan, mark loves
  to hear himself talk so much
that when he's quiet,
I know there's something
  going on.
Guys, I'm--I'm gonna make
  this easy for you.
I've made several investments
  in language.
One of the challenges is,
  no solution has everything.
Human translators
  sometimes don't fit
for very verticalized
  applications,
because you can't hit 'em all
  fast enough
or find the right people.
Machine language--
  vice versa.
So when you go
  into big commercial accounts,
it'd be a huge bonus
  to have both.
So, what I'm willing to do,
without hearing
  any of these guys,
because that's just
  a waste of time...
is $250,000 for 25%,
  yes or no?
(kunal) So what do you think?
Some good offers
  on the table.
It's a little bit low--
  Lower than what we wanted.
I wouldn't mind going
  with, um,
mark and Robert if we can
  bring them down to 20%.
What do you think?
  Mr. Wonderful has
  a lot of experience.
He does have
  a lot of experience.
Do you want him
  as an investor?
(Robert) I gotta tell you,
  I think we could have got
a better deal if we, uh,
  went in on this together.
Who do you think's
  gonna get it?
  I don't know.
  This is a tough one.
