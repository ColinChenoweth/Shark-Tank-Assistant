and gain powerful partners
to start, grow, or save
  their businesses.
Last year, we grossed 1.5.
1.5?
  Million.
How much again?
  If the sharks hear
  a great idea,
they're ready to invest
  using their own money.
Everything in my bones is saying
  This is a runaway hit.
And they'll fight each other
  for a piece of the action.
You take a big risk
  with me dropping out.
  Not really.
Have you seen me drop out
  in situations like this before?
  Are you dropping out?
Kevin brings nothing
  to a table.
But first, the entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
  with nothing.
The logos are crap,
  the whole thing's crap.
Is crap the brand?
It's sink...
  we're pre-Revenue,
  so we're actually--
Oh, I love that word.
  Or swim?
The line has been drawn
  in the sand.
What are you gonna do?
  Are these your best offers?
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
  into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran
  went from working
as a waitress in manhattan
to building the city's
  preeminent Real estate empire.
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
  and branding expert
Who grew his homemade
  clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand fubu.
Robert herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his first
  internet companies
for over $350 million.
And mark cuban,
notorious billionaire
  entrepreneur
and the outspoken owner
  of the Dallas mavericks.
easier and faster.
and I'm cofounder
  of three day rule.
We're requesting
  $200,000
in exchange for 10% equity
  in our company.
Now, we are changing
the way that Singles
  in Big cities meet.
I was a lawyer
  working 16 hours a day
on my career, and zero hours
  a day on my love life.
I just didn't have time
  for mass-Market dating sites,
which are filled
  with millions of profiles
that are fake, inactive,
  or people who I'd never date.
I also didn't have time
  to spend yet another
Friday night at a bar
  talking to a guy,
only to realize
  that he had a girlfriend.
I knew that I wasn't alone,
and I knew
  that busy professionals
deserved
  a better experience,
which is why we created
  three day rule.
Three day rule is unique from
  other mass-Market dating sites,
because everyone must be invited
  or must be endorsed to get in.
Think of it
  as a private dating club,
with the result being
  a quality pool
of extraordinary singles.
Here's how it works--
  People request membership.
They go through a competitive
  application process.
Once people are accepted,
  they take a quiz.
We determine
  what their type is.
They receive matches,
  and can start communicating--
even with me as the cofounder
  who is single.
But they can start communicating
  with other singles
and quickly go on dates.
We are ready to compete in this
  $3 billion market Opportunity
and help the 96 million singles
  in this country alone
find love.
Oh...
  and what that results in
  is people waiting by the phone,
not going out on dates, and not
  really meeting the real--
but you are aware of
  the three date rule as well?
We are aware
  of that rule, but...
  what is that rule?
That's not what we're pushing.
  What is the three date rule,
  Kevin?
Explain that rule, Kevin.
  The three date rule...
(laughing)
  is an investment
  portfolio strategy.
(laughs)
  Third date is when
  the bond comes through.
You consummate the deal.
  (laughs) Oh, god.
(daymond) So this is for
  busy, wealthy people, or...
Well, we look for
  a number of criteria.
Our demographic
  is the 12 million people
who are making
  over $50,000.
They have to make
  over $50,000 to get in?
No--I mean, it's definitely
  who we're marketing to.
What we're looking for
  is people
who are established
  in their career,
who have had accomplishments,
not only in
  their professional life,
but also in
  their personal life,
and who are
  relationship-Minded.
The key differentiator
  from the other dating sites
is that we actually have
  an application process,
or a quiz, before you get
  onto the site.
You may find this hard
  to believe,
but sometimes guys lie.
I know. (laughs)
  It's horrible.
and we have additional premium
  services that we'll offer.
An additional
  revenue stream for us
beyond the subscription fee
  that we're charging
fake eyelashes, fake lips,
  and fake hair...
  (laughing)
They're not lying?
  (laughs) Good point.
  Good point.
Now, how many members
  do you have now?
We have about 10,000 people
that have submitted
  applications.
Paid the subscription fee?
No. We're pre-Revenue,
  so we're actually--
Oh, I love that word--
  "Pre-Revenue."
(laughs) We're actually
  in our data build.
What it means is you
  have no sales.
We launched
  about four weeks ago,
and one of the things
  that we wanted to do
was build up
  a core base of users.
So at this point,
  we decided that we will not
implement a paywall,
  as they call it
in the dating industry,
  until day Three.
  Yeah, but that's
  hardly a test.
Everybody jumps in
  without paying.
One of the things
  that we had
is we an earlier version
  of this business,
and what we had was a successful
  offline matchmaking business.
You had this business before?
  We did.
We had events, and we also
  had activities,
and we had matchmaking.
  And what happened
  to it?
So that business
  is still existing.
What's happening
  is we're actually
scaling that business
  to this online offering.
How much is a subscription?
$100 is the base subscription.
For a 1-year subscription?
  No, for one month.
So it would be $100
  per month.
  $100 a month?
Yes.
  But you haven't done that yet.
  You haven't proven that yet.
You--
  we actually have
  in our offline model.
How many members do you have
  in that original business?
So for that,
  close to 10,000 people.
(Barbara) and what's
  your revenue for that business?
From that, it was about
  $70,000 from last year.
Are you single?
I'm single, yes.
If you're single,
  maybe the product doesn't work.
No, it a-- (laughs)
  Aww!
That's not True.
  I'm creating-- (laughs)
  I'm asking.
Maybe she's too picky,
  daymond.
  No!
I've been single because
  I've been working
16 hours a day,
  and I don't have time
to really go out
  and meet people,
so I'm building this--
  but have you gone
  on your own Web site?
I have. Actually, that was
  my profile you just saw,
so I'm--
  so you haven't met
  your Mr. Wonderful yet.
Well, I've put up a profile.
  I started communicating.
But my business partner
  is an expert matchmaker.
She's been matchmaking
  for, uh,
pro--a very long time...
  (mark) Wait, wait, wait,
  wait, wait, wait.
So she has that knowledge.
So if you got 10,000 people,
  how many signed up
for the $100 per year fee?
We charge them $1,000
  for 3 dates.
Whoa!
  $1,000 for 3 dates?
It's actually--
  whoa! Boy, you gotta
  fall in love right away.
Or you gotta cash
  that check right away.
We did. But, uh...
And you basically made
  70 sales?
Right, but we had events
  and activities also
where we collected
  a transaction fee
and a ticket price
  to attend our event, so...
  complicated.
Did you make money
  on the events as well?
  We did.
Is that a revenue generator?
The online/offline commerce
  industry is huge.
and we said, "One of your
  competitors, three day rule,
said you don't screen at all,"
  what would they say?
They probably would agree.
  Those--
No.
  Those companies
  are about volume.
No, I don't think so.
So--and you're gonna have
  to explain to me...
  yes.
How you make money
  at some point today.
  Absolutely.
So I'll take you down
  the path to revenue.
Members will pay
  $100 per month.
They're able to buy
  subscriptions
in one-Month, 3-Month,
  and 6-Month increments.
We estimate
  people will stay on
Probably between
  three and six months.
We will make anywhere between
  $300 and $600 per customer.
So, if you have
  200,000 members,
and you go across
  20 Major metropolitan cities,
by year 3, you have
  a $20 million business.
But you have
  no anecdotal evidence
that that's going to be
  your metric.
and it's real,
  you got a home run.
I agree,
  and I think we do.
But you haven't proven that.
One last chance.
  Okay.
And don't tell me
  you have a questionnaire...
  okay.
And you have algorithms.
Tell me, what is it?
And don't tell me
  you have a questionnaire
and you have algorithms.
  Tell me, what is it?
There's an implicit trust
  that whoever you're meeting
is someone who's been vetted,
  so people don't feel like
they're putting themselves
  out there on a dating site
Where everyone can see
  their love life.
I just don't think
  that's strong enough.
I think that every matchmaker,
they would tell you
  the exact same thing.
That's just not enough
  of a differentiation,
so for that reason,
  I'm out.
I don't think three day rule's
  ever going to dominate
the dating business online.
That's already done.
The guys that have
  established scale There
now can squeeze you like
  a teenage pimple if they want.
(laughs)
  They can do all kinds
  of things to you
that are gonna hurt
  if you start to Garner share.
And maybe they'll buy you,
  maybe they'll crush you.
I don't know. But for me,
  that's too big a risk.
So for that reason, I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
You're asking $200,000
  for 10%.
And that's--
  how much have you
  raised there?
"Never trust a skinny chef,"
  right?
Well, never invest
  in a single matchmaker.
I'm out.
I'm not clear,
  and I keep coming back to,
you're just another dating site.
  No, we're different.
We are different from
  the mass-Market dating sites.
But I don't think
  you explained that.
I was looking for you to say,
"Here's all
  the other dating sites,
but here's why I'm different."
And for me,
  you didn't do that today.
For that reason, I'm out.
You were not convincing here
  at all.
In fact, I would say
  you were confusing,
and I was listening hard.
And most importantly,
  the name is terrible.
Three day rule--
  I'm a girl,
and I even interpreted it
the way these guys
  interpreted it.
(laughs)
  I like that.
Third day, you better put out.
  I like that.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
I'll take $90,000
  and add a zero to it.
So now we're at $900,000.
I'll give you $1 million.
You, my friend,
  become a millionaire.
Yowza!
Dreams have come True...
take the offer.
  Of course. Yes!
Put your game face on!
  (Barbara) Good decision.
It's a deal.
  And countless lives
  have changed.
Since I made a deal with Lori,
  we've done $3 million in sales.
She said she was gonna
  make me a millionaire,
and here we are.
  (pops)
(cheering)
(man)
  Since airing on "Shark tank,"
We've sold over $1 million worth
  of kisstixx products.
Since partnering with Robert,
  we're already over
$1.5 million.
"Shark tank" Changed my life.
We have $300,000 in Sales
  in over 300 stores.
(Robert) This is gonna be
  a multimillion-Dollar company
very soon.
We have 165 locations,
and we're pointing toward
  $20 million in sales.
(man) Since going on
  "Shark tank,"
We've done close to $500,000
  in just 2 months.
We're on track to hit
  $5 million
in this first year.
It sounds corny, but it is
  the American dream,
and we honestly feel like
  we're living it.
(man) We've been so good to our
  local economy here in maine,
we've been invited
  to the governor's home.
You're creating great jobs
for the people
  in the state of maine.
So keep 'em coming.
  (chuckles)
  Thank you.
(woman) I don't know where I
  would be without "Shark tank."
It's more than just a tv show.
It is sincerely something that
  has made my dreams come True.
Now it's your turn.
  Ba-Bam!
If you think your business
  has what it takes
to swim with the sharks,
go to abc.Com
  for your chance of a lifetime.
Next up
  are Ryan and Daniela Kelly
A dog and a kid.
Hi. I'm Ryan, and I'm 11.
(laughs)
  And I'm his mom Daniela.
And this is Barkley,
  my best friend
who inspired me
  to start my company,
Ryan's barkery bakes and sells
  fresh, all-Natural dog treats--
So fresh,
  they should be slapped!
(laughter)
  If your family is like mine,
then you consider your pet
  to be part of the family
just like Barkley.
After we adopted him,
we went shopping
  for dog treats
and found
  that they smelled horrible.
They couldn't possibly
  taste fresh and be wholesome.
Since Ryan and I share
  a passion for baking,
we consulted
  with a veterinarian
to find out which ingredients
  are good for dogs,
then started experimenting
  in the kitchen.
We didn't stop experimenting
  until we found the flavors
that Barkley
  cannot get enough of.
We made super flavors
  like pumpkin apple,
banana oat,
  and low-Fat cheddar.
Our treats are baked fresh
  with simple ingredients
and no preservatives.
I rode my bike
  to my friends' houses
and did taste tests
  with their dogs.
(laughing)
  Their dogs went crazy
  for our treats.
Look how Barkley reacts.
  (gasps and whispers) a treat.
Look at that.
  (Robert laughs)
I started getting calls
  from PET Owners
asking where they could
  buy these treats,
and that's how
  the barkery was born.
With an investment
  from you,
we could develop our Web site
  and start fulfilling orders
in a commercial kitchen.
We need your partnership
  in order to grow,
because I can't do this alone...
  (Barbara laughs)
And keep up with my homework.
  (laughter)
Thank you for your time.
  We brought some treats
for you to see, smell,
  and even taste if you'd like.
(gasps)
They're human-Grade?
  They are.
And is he getting up
  at 5:00 with you?
Um, no, be--
sometimes when I--
  like lacrosse practice,
and there's an adoption event,
  I'll let him go,
and then he can keep
  some of the money that he makes.
Your older brother's
  working for you?
Yeah.
  That's awesome.
Have you sold any of these?
We've sold
  about 200 bags of them.
And what does it cost you
  to make one of those bags?
36 cents each bag.
and s--Um, give out
  little samples,
because there's a lot
  of dogs there.
And a lot of people
  bought them there
and just kept on repeating.
But did they ever buy them
  again without you there?
Yeah.
  Yes.
At the lacrosse game?
  Because the labels have
  our phone number on it, so...
and Where'd you get
  the money from?
(laughs)
  From my best investor,
of course--my mom.
  (Barbara) How much?
and at some
  of the adoption events,
I give her a lot of the money
  to help pay her back.
and the Web site...
  Mm-hmm.
Where people could, um,
  develop orders,
and then we fulfill them.
(laughter)
  And do this full-Time.
And the reason I started
  my business was because
I wanted a new pair
  of basketball shoes.
And I went door to door
  to door selling garbage bags.
My garbage bag route
  is not all that much different
than what you're doing
  with your treats.
But $25,000 is a lot
  of money,
and with all that money
  comes a lot of responsibility,
and I think it would be
  very, very difficult
for you, while you're
  still in school
and while you're trying
  to balance all these things,
really to put that money
  to work, so...
a-as much as I'm--
  I'm excited for you,
I'm proud of you, um, I think
  you're gonna do amazing things,
but I still have to say
  I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
But to be 11 years old
  and actually go out there
and dream about that--
  That's fantastic.
Look, this is not the business
that I want to invest
  with you in today,
but I think you'll be back.
And for that business,
hopefully I'll be here,
  and we can talk then.
But for this today, I'm out.
Thank you.
people all wanted to be rappers
  and Gangsters and...
when I told my buddies
that I was going to be
  a fashion designer,
they laughed at me.
  But I didn't care.
How do your friends
  feel about this?
I think they're jealous
  now that I'm here.
(laughter)
  They are.
And I think Barbara's making
  you a very generous offer,
but I--
  but what?
I want you to really think
  about what cuban said, though.
You're gonna have to sell almost
  $150,000 worth of cookies
to pay her back.
  Guess what.
You don't have to pay me back
  until your 13th birthday.
  Bar--Barbara, all I want to--
and all you have to do
  is pay me back
$5,000 a year.
By your 13th birthday,
  that's gonna be nothing.
I just want you to understand...
  the responsibilities.
The responsibility.
  I think she is a great partner,
but sometimes money just creates
  a bigger problem.
I think you're gonna be
  really good without us.
So I'm out.
I wish I could adopt you!
  Car and college!
  Car and College!
Look at this little guy.
  Let me lift him up.
(Robert speaks indistinctly)
  Whoa! Good job!
Nice job.
  Thank you.
Nice job.
  Never heard a better pitch.
I'm Corey ward.
  And I'm trew Quackenbush.
We're from cincinnati, ohio.
  And we are Tom + Chee.
(sizzling)
Tom + Chee is a grilled cheese
  and tomato soup shop
for the kid at heart.
And a beef cheddar
  and a grilled cheese donut
going to "C."
I think people Love
  grilled Cheese
'cause it is
  a classic comfort food.
It's something that everybody
  had growing up.
Sandwiches with Melted cheese
  on it--
it doesn't really get
  much better than that.
What sets Tom + Chee apart
  would be our creativity,
the use of many different
  ingredients, combinations.
We're always offering
  something
that's fun and unique.
One more basket
  for a donut, please.
I got a bananarama
  coming over.
Tom + Chee is
  a family business.
Corey and I
  and our wives,
we all emptied
  our bank accounts,
we all quit our jobs
  to start our cheesy empire.
Our restaurants have been
  very busy.
So busy, in fact,
  that sometimes it feels
we can't keep up
  with demand.
We're ready to go in
  and see these sharks.
We need this investment
  because the PUBLIC demands
Tom + Chee, and we need
  to keep up with them.
Good afternoon, sharks.
  My name is Corey ward.
And I'm trew Quackenbush.
  Our company is Tom + Chee.
We're seeking $600,000
in exchange
  for 10% of our company.
(sharks laugh)
$600,000 may seem
  like a lot
for an empire built
  on cheesy goodness,
but I assure you, once you
  taste what trew's cooking...
  (sizzling)
You'll be a believer.
Corey and his wife came over
  for a cookout at my house,
and he said, "do you want
  to open up a grilled cheese
and tomato soup Shop?"
  Thankfully,
  trew said Yes,
so in the winter of 2009,
  we emptied our bank accounts,
we bought a tent
  and a griddle,
and set up on
  Cincinnati's Fountain square
next to an ice skating rink.
The response was incredible.
What started out as curiosity
  quickly turned to excitement,
as word of mouth spread.
And 364 days
  after we set up our tent,
we opened our first shop,
  and it wasn't long before
we had lines out the door.
Then we got an offer
  from a local mall.
They liked our concept so much,
they basically handed us
  our second restaurant.
This year, Tom + Chee sold
  our very first franchise,
in louisville, kentucky.
With your help, we want to
  expand our franchising efforts
and really build
  something special.
We now have over 70 employees,
  and we're growing.
We are proof the American dream
  is still alive,
and we know that with your help,
  we will be the next big thing.
I've created our world-Famous
  grilled cheese donut
for you to try,
  and whoever makes this deal
not only is getting
  a good opportunity,
but we're gonna name
  a sandwich after you.
Let's feed some to Barbara
  and see if she lives.
(laughter)
This is a donut?
It is a glazed--
  Yeast-Glazed donut.
Yeah.
  (Robert) So I'm eating
  a donut that's been Fried?
It's not been Fried,
  it's been grilled.
  Grilled.
Mmm!
Oh!
I got to admit,
  it tastes great.
Is this your only product?
I mean, you mentioned
  some of these here,
and I'm guessing there's
  tomato soup?
Correct.
  Yes.
And you sell traditional
  Grilled cheeses as well?
We have over 20 sandwiches
  on the menu.
Can we see your menus?
  Of course.
Okay, so give us
  the breakdown,
because as interesting
  as it sounds
to talk about
  a grilled cheese and donut,
that doesn't mean that's
  what everybody is buying.
Well, our most popular sandwich
  is the barbecue Bacon,
where we take
  barbecue potato chips,
Bacon, American cheese,
  and we put it on white bread.
Does that come
  with a defibrillator?
(laughs)
It comes with a lot of "Yum"S,
  is what it comes with.
Um, we do pesto and turkey,
  we roast our own meats,
create our own
  sauces and spreads.
Everything we do
  is pretty much vegetarian,
as far as soup Goes,
  unless we put meat in the title.
So we definitely are--are
  pushing a health-Conscious--
(laughing)
  "Health-Conscious"!
health? Health-Conscious?
It's grilled cheese.
  (laughs)
So, the sandwiches are
  relatively cheap.
The menus
  are definitely cheap.
So are you guys perceived
  in your marketplace as being
a really inexpensive place
  to go get lunch?
I'm gonna re-Articulate
  his question.
The menu looks like crap.
The logos are crap,
  the whole thing's crap.
Is crap the brand?
It's gourmet grilled cheese
  that--
That's given out
  at a reasonable price.
In this economy,
  everybody needs something
that they can take
  a family of five out to,
and we can do that
  at Tom + Chee.
You can come in
  And you can sit down with--
With all your little kids,
and everybody can have
  a great meal
and walk away happy.
You have 70 employees.
  What are your sales?
Our--Our two corporate stores,
  um, have grossed--
last year, we grossed 1.5.
1.5?
Million.
How much again?
  You sold $1.5 million
  of this stuff?
In the last 12 months.
  Very impressive.
We've actually done
  $1,400 in an hour.
They will wait
  an hour and a half
just to get up to order.
If I drove by your shop,
I'd see people lined up
  out the door?
Yes.
  Out the door.
Tell me what
  the franchise fees are.
Okay, So, uh, to get in,
  it's, um, $35,000.
And then, like, 7.5%
  comes back to us.
And our franchisee,
  he had to spend about
$250,000 to get
  his first store open.
How's his monthly sales doing?
Great.
  He did $100,000 last month.
Wow.
You know what I love
  about your business?
You have
  the most important ingredient--
the magic
  of any great business--
You've got a line out front.
  Yeah.
And I'm going to give you
  an offer.
I'm gonna give you...
half of the $600,000
for 30% of the business
if you can get another shark
  in on the deal.
I'm sitting here
  and I'm thinking to myself,
what's the odds that these
  two guys are gonna win?
And everything in my bones
  is saying This is a runaway hit.
This is a Winner.
I want to let you guys
  get a little more focused here.
Okay.
  My portfolio kinda goes
  the opposite way.
I-I really believe
  in healthy products,
so this just wouldn't be
  for me. I'm out.
Okay.
  Okay.
You know, I'm sitting
  on the fence here,
looking at this saying,
  these guys have come up
with something so outrageous
  that it worked.
I would have never thought
  this would have Worked, ever.
And it has. All right,
  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna throw 100 grand in
just to be a piece
  of this really crazy idea.
All right, I'm in on that.
  How much you in, Robert?
You have $100,000 or $200,000
  available.
  I'm in for $100,000.
Barbara, Robert, and Kevin
have made an offer, but trew
  and Corey need another $100,000
from the last remaining shark
  to reach the $600,000
they have asked for.
What are you thinking,
  mark?
You know you have
  the resources to help us grow.
We've done our research.
I'm not gonna do $100,000.
It's just not worth
  the time and aggravation.
But...
what I will do is
  I'll go in with Barbara.
I'll match
  Barbara's $300,000.
So each of us will put in
  $300k for a total of $600k,
for a total of 30% equity,
but I don't want
  all the sharks in.
That's just too much work,
  too much Hassle,
too much paperwork.
And in addition,
I want the rights
  to the state of texas,
just in case it takes off.
We actually have a--
  a very interested person
for Dallas already.
Well, then
  we'll carve out Dallas,
and if they don't close,
then that'll revert
  back to me.
And may I say
  I want new York?
Because I'm gonna be jealous
  of him carving that out.
(laughs)
I'm--I'm sorry, guys.
  I'm not in love with it enough
to compete and start
  to bid this thing up.
I just can't get there.
  I'm out.
I'll clear the field.
  You got Barbara, you got mark.
$300,000 each for 30%.
  What do you say?
I'd say we take the Deal.
  Yeah.
Yes, sir!
  Thank you, mark.
  This is gonna be awesome.
You gu--You were the two
  that we were talking about
the whole time.
  It's not easy being
  cheesy, right?
You know it.
  (laughter)
Good for you. Good for you.
  Thank you, guys, so much.
You gotta shave a little,
  you know?
  (laughs)
Would have never seen that
  coming.
Not in a million years.
Awesome.
  (laughs)
I've already got
  all the people in place.
I've got a buyer. I-I can
  take it to wisconsin cheese.
Good. You do all the work,
  I'll collect the profit.
It's a deal?
  No.
(laughs)
That's not a bad deal
  for $600,000.
Who's ready to make
  some cheddar? (laughs)
  (laughs)
He is kunal sarda,
  and they are the cofounders
of verbalizeit.
Estamos buscando DOSCIENTOS
  CINCUENTA MIL DOLARES
POR QUINCE POR CIENTO
  DE nuestro compañia.
They are seeking $250,000
for 15% of their company.
In case you haven't
  figured it out,
Erica is a translator,
and her job is to help
  people from around the world
talk to each other.
Verbalizeit allows you
  to put Erica
in your back pocket.
Here's how it works.
  With verbalizeit,
you simply register
  at the verbalizeit Web site,
or download the app.
Within 15 seconds, you press
  a button on your phone.
You're instantly connected
  to one of our live translators
around the world.
You tell that translator
  what you need,
place the phone on speaker.
Our translators communicate
  on your behalf.
Every year, millions
  of international travelers
run into situations where
  they cannot communicate
because of
  the language Barrier.
We want to work with you
  to put verbalizeit
in the hands of individuals
  and businesses around the world.
So who's ready to make a deal?
Thank you, Erica.
What's your background?
  Where did you come from?
Uh, kunal and I met
  in business school.
What business school
  did you meet in?
  At Wharton.
Wow.
  (daymond) hmm.
to one of our thousands
  of translators
around the world.
So you're sourcing people
  that have capacity
at that moment,
  anywhere in the world--
if I'm in egypt, if I'm
  in russia, I'm in cyprus,
I need greek--You have
  enough people now sourced
to actually translate for me?
That's what's really
  interesting, Mr. Wonderful.
(sharks laugh)
  We have created
  this global community
of multilingual individuals
who are monetizing on
  their spare time during the day.
This is very interesting,
but I'm trying to figure out
  the business model,
because the key to this is,
  every single time I call,
the guy's gotta be there
  translating for me
30 seconds later.
  Absolutely.
We have 2,000 translators
  already around the world,
and we're live
  in Five languages,
and we can connect your call
  within 15 seconds
of you dialing
  into the system.
  I'm trying to figure out
how you can get
  somebody that quickly
in a language,
  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
It's a great question, sir.
  What we've created here
is a powerful community
  of people around the world
who speak a second language
and want to be able to make
  money during their spare time.
So by virtue of having such
  a large population of people
who want to make money,
your call will automatically
  always be answered.
can download it for free
  and try it for free,
one free call.
  And then afterwards,
our customers pay anywhere
  from 50 cents to $1 per minute,
depending on how many minutes
  they buy.
And then how do you pay
  the translators?
Translators make anywhere
  between $7 and $15 an hour
based on every minute
  that they translate.
What percentage
  of the 50 cents
you're collecting a minute
  is that?
Uh, we have a 70% margin.
And what are your sales
  to date?
In the last 2 weeks,
  we have had $10,000 in sales.
How long has it been
  on the market?
Verbalizeit has been live
  as of one month.
How do you filter
  these people?
How do you get these, uh,
  translators, and how do you
trust that they're gonna
  translate Correctly?
Uh, the first and foremost,
  we found 50 TRANSLATORS
by going out and talking
  to language learning centers,
and we said, "Okay, would you
  like to join our community?"
and then we got tremendous
  word-of-Mouth referrals.
Do you have a ratings system
  after the Call is over...
  yes, we do.
To rate the translators?
  We do. So you build up
  a reputation
as a higher-Quality translator,
  you make more money.
Wow.
  Our top translator made
$550
  in the last 2 days.
There are so many
  translation apps out there.
Why is this specifically
  different from everything else?
Well, on the one hand, you have
  machine-Based technology,
which just doesn't work.
And I'm gonna disagree
  with you there significantly.
Machine language translation
  does work,
particularly
  in a business environment.
So you have to go out
  and find translators
that understand business.
Because if we are doing a deal,
  and someone said
they've got
  a subordinated note
that has a buyout at 13%,
  and we're gonna do
a Cram--
  whatever it may be,
typical Translator's
  not gonna understand that.
Our community ranges
  from people
who have just graduated
  high school
to people who have their phds
  and their business degrees.
But you lose
  your instantaneous aspect of it
because that person
  has got to be available.
'cause it's not like
  there's an unlimited number
of those people
  willing to work cheap.
What does your business
  look like
in terms of the languages?
So we are live
  in Five languages, as I said.
Which five?
  Hindi, mandarin,
  spanish,
portuguese, and French.
Why not croatian?
  (sharks laugh)
We don't have a translator yet.
  How about joining us?
I got some time.
  We've only been live
  for a month,
and we're very excited with
  some of the large partnerships
that we're working on.
We just launched a pilot
  with Skype,
which means that any one
  of the 31 million Skype users
can add a verbalizeit translator
  into any conversation.
You've made that deal
  with skype?
  We have. We--
wow. Hang--Whoa.
Tell us how that deal works.
  Wow.
So we reached out to skype,
  given the--
the fact that
  they're a fantastic company.
We are now the featured app
  in the skype app directory.
Is it an exclusive deal?
Can someone else
  in your space come in
and also offer
  the same thing to skype?
Well, since we don't have
  an exclusivity agreement,
someone could technically
  come in.
I see.
There aren't a lot
  of companies out there
doing what we're doing,
  and we do have
a word-of-Mouth agreement that
  that won't be the case.
I happen to think
  that skype piece
is the sex appeal
  in the whole deal.
Creates a lot of confidence.
I really thought that was
  a real deal,
like you cornered
  the skype space.
So I'm out. 'cause... too shaky
  for me. I'm too scared.
So, guys, my other fellow sharks
  are asking a lot of questions,
because there's clearly gonna be
  some blood in the water.
This is really
  in their tech space.
But I'm gonna watch them fight,
and this is really
  gonna be good.
I'm out.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
Why don't you go ahead
  and step in the hall
and talk about it, okay?
Because I don't want it
  to be polluted
by these guys,
  'cause it just drags things on.
Do you want to hear
  any other offers?
We--we want to hear
  other offers, correct.
(Kevin) Good.
  Then you take--You take
  a big risk with me dropping out.
Not really.
  Have you seen me drop out
  in situations like this before?
Are you dropping out?
but Kevin and Robert are both
  circling around the bait.
Just to keep it interesting,
  I'll give you $250,000 for 20%.
I'll do $250,000 for 25%.
I think you guys
  are smart guys.
I think you'll pick
  the right partner.
(mark and daymond) Sure.
  Absolutely.
Thanks, guys.
  Thank you.
It's a fascinating model.
He's a cool character.
mark and Robert if we can
  bring them down to 20%.
What do you think?
  Mr. Wonderful has
  a lot of experience.
He does have
  a lot of experience.
Do you want him
  as an investor?
(Robert) I gotta tell you,
  I think we could have got
a better deal if we, uh,
  went in on this together.
Who do you think's
  gonna get it?
  I don't know.
  This is a tough one.
So we'd like to understand
  a little bit better
whether or not mark and Robert
Can improve their offers
to beat
  Mr. Wonderful's offer.
I'll add one thing.
I have somebody
  who works for me--
All she does is
  machine language translation.
If you don't think 5% is worth
  just an introduction
to one of the most advanced
  Machine language translation,
um, software systems
  and servers in the business...
(clicks tongue)
  That's up to you.
give you incremental business,
  and it may or it may not.
Your business model
  isn't actually tied to that.
You need the flexibility
to expand the opportunity
  and do a little more research
on what the best path is,
  and here's what I know--
You want to give up
  as little equity as you can
right now,
  because if it works,
every single point
  is gonna be worth a fortune.
You know what, guys?
That's a whole shakespeare
  "Much ado about nothing."
That whole sentence.
  I mean, I've been selling
into the call center Environment
  When Kevin still had hair.
I actually had
  a call center Business.
That's the difference.
  He's just a sales rep.
I ran a business.
  Oh, my--my friend, I'm much
  more than a sales rep.
At the end of the day,
  you've got to make a decision
about how much equity do you
  want to part with now?
Kevin brings nothing
  to a table.
You know, with all due respect,
  I think mark is in that business
like I'm in that business.
  No, they're not
  in your business.
I'm gonna stick
  to my $250,000.
  They're not doing
  what you're doing.
No, I-I really am
  in their business.
You're in
  machine language translation.
That's not the same thing.
  I'm calling
  on the same customers,
which is all the more reason.
  That's not--
  That's also not True.
Yes, it is True.
  (daymond) All right, guys.
The line has been drawn
  in the sand.
These are hard offers
  by the sharks.
What are you gonna do?
Estamos pensando. Okay?
(lowered voice)
  What would you like to do?
(whispers indistinctly)
Mr. Wonderful,
  you have a deal.
Oh!
  Whoa.
Whoa!
  (Barbara) Surprise.
Looking forward to working
  with you guys.
  Likewise.
Wow.
  (Kevin) Very interesting.
Thanks a lot.
  (speaking indistinctly)
Take care. All right.
  Congratulations.
but Mr. Wonderful just showed
  that he really understands
what our business
  is about.
We're really excited
  to be working with him.
