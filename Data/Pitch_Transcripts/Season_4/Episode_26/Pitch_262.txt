First into the tank
  is Val Brennan,
who feels she has a way
  to find love
My name is Val Brennan,
Many questions, Val.
  First of all,
do I impute from your name,
  the three day rule,
that perhaps
  after Three dates...
I might...
  (laughs)
What am I--what's the word
  I'm looking for?
Love?
  Action.
Yeah.
  No, no, no.
(laughter)
  Guys, guys--
  When we read that,
we don't read
  "Three day rule."
We read "Three date rule,"
  you know?
Oh, three date rule?
  No, actually...
  Oh...
(laughs)
  Is that what you're
  implying?
No. Let's clarify
  any ambiguity.
So, the three day rule
  was this rule in pop culture
that people thought, "I can't
  call somebody For three days
because I'll seem
  too desperate."
Do you validate
  any of that information?
We do validate
  the answers,
is actual validation.
So members will actually
  have a verified--
So unless I buy extra,
  I get the liars,
is what you're saying?
But, Robert, Robert,
  what's the criteria for women?
You don't think women lie?
I think women tend to be
  more honest in dating--
so you're saying Somebody
  puts on fake nails,
(Robert) So, Val, how long
  did you do that model?
We did that model
  for about a year.
It's a $3 trillion industry.
  Val, I just don't
  understand one thing.
Other sites that we see on Tv--
  don't they all do...
(Kevin) they do.
  A similar thing?
No.
  What--what is
  the difference?
The difference is we actually
  screen people coming in
to the community.
  Those sites
  don't screen people?
They don't screen...
  okay.
So anybody with
  an e-Mail address can log on
to some of those
  mass-Market dating sites.
Just pretend you worked
  for one of those companies,
Val, all I care about
  is money, okay?
You know, Val,
  you have the perfect answers,
but they're all based
  on theory.
Um, I'm looking for
  a reason to say yes.
Because if there is
  a way to differentiate
Our major selling point,
  our value proposition
is that everyone
  must be endorsed,
so there is social context
  around every member.
You know that
  that person has gone through
an application process.
  They've been approved.
You do understand you're
  valuing this at $2 million?
Yes.
  You're not in love
  with the valuation?
No, I don't think so.
I'll tell you a little bit
  about the valuation.
We already have investors
  already committed
and money in the bank
  at a $4 million valuation.
We've raised
  a $150,000 stake.
  At a $4 million valuation?
Yes, that's right,
  but we realize
the value that you bring
  to the table.
So, Val, you know the saying
(Robert) So, Val... (sighs)
It's been
  an interesting journey.
  Okay.
You're very pleasant.
I feel like we're on
  a date right now. (laughs)
Oh.
Good luck, Val.
(Robert) You were dead-On
  about the name, though.
I love the name!
I think if she could
  guarantee the three day rule,
then she'd have something
  proprietary, mark.
is that it's not just about
  creating value,
it's also about
  capturing value.
not the language of building
  something of value.
You know what the good news is?
  I'll end up competing with them.
Bring it on.
In the end,
  it wasn't about the 5%,
