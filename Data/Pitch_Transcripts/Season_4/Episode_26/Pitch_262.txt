who turned a $10,000 loan
  into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran
  went from working
as a waitress in manhattan
to building the city's
  preeminent Real estate empire.
Daymond John is a fashion mogul
  and branding expert
Who grew his homemade
  clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand fubu.
Robert herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his first
  internet companies

And mark cuban,
notorious billionaire
  entrepreneur
and the outspoken owner
  of the Dallas mavericks.
but you are aware of
  the three date rule as well?
We are aware
  of that rule, but...
  what is that rule?
That's not what we're pushing.
  What is the three date rule,
  Kevin?
Explain that rule, Kevin.
  The three date rule...
(laughing)
  is an investment
  portfolio strategy.
(laughs)
  Third date is when
  the bond comes through.
You consummate the deal.
  (laughs) Oh, god.
(daymond) So this is for
  busy, wealthy people, or...
Well, we look for
  a number of criteria.
Our demographic
  is the 12 million people
who are making
  over $50,000.
They have to make
  over $50,000 to get in?
No--I mean, it's definitely
  who we're marketing to.
What we're looking for
  is people
who are established
  in their career,
who have had accomplishments,
not only in
  their professional life,
but also in
  their personal life,
and who are
  relationship-Minded.
The key differentiator
  from the other dating sites
is that we actually have
  an application process,
or a quiz, before you get
  onto the site.
You may find this hard
  to believe,
but sometimes guys lie.
I know. (laughs)
  It's horrible.
That's not True.
  I'm creating-- (laughs)
  I'm asking.
Maybe she's too picky,
  daymond.
  No!
I've been single because
  I've been working
16 hours a day,
  and I don't have time
to really go out
  and meet people,
so I'm building this--
  but have you gone
  on your own Web site?
I have. Actually, that was
  my profile you just saw,
so I'm--
  so you haven't met
  your Mr. Wonderful yet.
Well, I've put up a profile.
  I started communicating.
But my business partner
  is an expert matchmaker.
She's been matchmaking
  for, uh,
pro--a very long time...
  (mark) Wait, wait, wait,
  wait, wait, wait.
So she has that knowledge.
So if you got 10,000 people,
  how many signed up
for the $100 per year fee?
We charge them $1,000
  for 3 dates.
Whoa!
  $1,000 for 3 dates?
It's actually--
  whoa! Boy, you gotta
  fall in love right away.
Or you gotta cash
  that check right away.
We did. But, uh...
There's an implicit trust
  that whoever you're meeting
is someone who's been vetted,
  so people don't feel like
they're putting themselves
  out there on a dating site
Where everyone can see
  their love life.
I just don't think
  that's strong enough.
I think that every matchmaker,
they would tell you
  the exact same thing.
That's just not enough
  of a differentiation,
so for that reason,
  I'm out.
I don't think three day rule's
  ever going to dominate
the dating business online.
That's already done.
The guys that have
  established scale There
now can squeeze you like
  a teenage pimple if they want.
(laughs)
  They can do all kinds
  of things to you
that are gonna hurt
  if you start to Garner share.
And maybe they'll buy you,
  maybe they'll crush you.
I don't know. But for me,
  that's too big a risk.
So for that reason, I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
You're asking $200,000
  for 10%.
"Never trust a skinny chef,"
  right?
Well, never invest
  in a single matchmaker.
I'm out.
Dreams have come True...
take the offer.
  Of course. Yes!
Put your game face on!
  (Barbara) Good decision.
It's a deal.
  And countless lives
  have changed.
Since I made a deal with Lori,
  we've done $3 million in sales.
She said she was gonna
  make me a millionaire,
and here we are.
  (pops)
(cheering)
(man)
  Since airing on "Shark tank,"
We've sold over $1 million worth
  of kisstixx products.
Since partnering with Robert,
  we're already over
$1.5 million.
"Shark tank" Changed my life.
We have $300,000 in Sales
  in over 300 stores.
(Robert) This is gonna be
  a multimillion-Dollar company
very soon.
We have 165 locations,
and we're pointing toward
  $20 million in sales.
(man) Since going on
  "Shark tank,"
We've done close to $500,000
  in just 2 months.
We're on track to hit
  $5 million
in this first year.
It sounds corny, but it is
  the American dream,
and we honestly feel like
  we're living it.
(man) We've been so good to our
  local economy here in maine,
we've been invited
  to the governor's home.
You're creating great jobs
for the people
  in the state of maine.
So keep 'em coming.
  (chuckles)
  Thank you.
(woman) I don't know where I
  would be without "Shark tank."
It's more than just a tv show.
It is sincerely something that
  has made my dreams come True.
Now it's your turn.
  Ba-Bam!
If you think your business
  has what it takes
to swim with the sharks,
go to abc.Com
  for your chance of a lifetime.
Next up
  are Ryan and Daniela Kelly
I'm Corey ward.
  And I'm trew Quackenbush.
We're from cincinnati, ohio.
  And we are Tom + Chee.
(sizzling)
Tom + Chee is a grilled cheese
  and tomato soup shop
for the kid at heart.
And a beef cheddar
  and a grilled cheese donut
going to "C."
I think people Love
  grilled Cheese
'cause it is
  a classic comfort food.
It's something that everybody
  had growing up.
Sandwiches with Melted cheese
  on it--
it doesn't really get
  much better than that.
What sets Tom + Chee apart
  would be our creativity,
the use of many different
  ingredients, combinations.
We're always offering
  something
that's fun and unique.
One more basket
  for a donut, please.
I got a bananarama
  coming over.
Tom + Chee is
  a family business.
Corey and I
  and our wives,
we all emptied
  our bank accounts,
we all quit our jobs
  to start our cheesy empire.
Our restaurants have been
  very busy.
So busy, in fact,
  that sometimes it feels
we can't keep up
  with demand.
We're ready to go in
  and see these sharks.
We need this investment
  because the PUBLIC demands
Tom + Chee, and we need
  to keep up with them.
Good afternoon, sharks.
  My name is Corey ward.
And I'm trew Quackenbush.
  Our company is Tom + Chee.
We're seeking $600,000
in exchange
  for 10% of our company.
(sharks laugh)
$600,000 may seem
  like a lot
for an empire built
  on cheesy goodness,
but I assure you, once you
  taste what trew's cooking...
  (sizzling)
You'll be a believer.
Corey and his wife came over
  for a cookout at my house,
and he said, "do you want
  to open up a grilled cheese
and tomato soup Shop?"
  Thankfully,
  trew said Yes,
so in the winter of 2009,
  we emptied our bank accounts,
we bought a tent
  and a griddle,
and set up on
  Cincinnati's Fountain square
next to an ice skating rink.
The response was incredible.
What started out as curiosity
  quickly turned to excitement,
as word of mouth spread.
And 364 days
  after we set up our tent,
we opened our first shop,
  and it wasn't long before
we had lines out the door.
Then we got an offer
  from a local mall.
They liked our concept so much,
they basically handed us
  our second restaurant.
This year, Tom + Chee sold
  our very first franchise,
in louisville, kentucky.
With your help, we want to
  expand our franchising efforts
and really build
  something special.
We now have over 70 employees,
  and we're growing.
We are proof the American dream
  is still alive,
and we know that with your help,
  we will be the next big thing.
I've created our world-Famous
  grilled cheese donut
for you to try,
  and whoever makes this deal
not only is getting
  a good opportunity,
but we're gonna name
  a sandwich after you.
Let's feed some to Barbara
  and see if she lives.
(laughter)
This is a donut?
It is a glazed--
  Yeast-Glazed donut.
Yeah.
  (Robert) So I'm eating
  a donut that's been Fried?
It's not been Fried,
  it's been grilled.
  Grilled.
Mmm!
Oh!
I got to admit,
  it tastes great.
Is this your only product?
I mean, you mentioned
  some of these here,
and I'm guessing there's
  tomato soup?
Correct.
  Yes.
And you sell traditional
  Grilled cheeses as well?
We have over 20 sandwiches
  on the menu.
Can we see your menus?
  Of course.
Okay, so give us
  the breakdown,
because as interesting
  as it sounds
to talk about
  a grilled cheese and donut,
that doesn't mean that's
  what everybody is buying.
Well, our most popular sandwich
  is the barbecue Bacon,
where we take
  barbecue potato chips,
Bacon, American cheese,
  and we put it on white bread.
Does that come
  with a defibrillator?
(laughs)
It comes with a lot of "Yum"S,
  is what it comes with.
Um, we do pesto and turkey,
  we roast our own meats,
create our own
  sauces and spreads.
Everything we do
  is pretty much vegetarian,
as far as soup Goes,
  unless we put meat in the title.
So we definitely are--are
  pushing a health-Conscious--
(laughing)
  "Health-Conscious"!
health? Health-Conscious?
It's grilled cheese.
  (laughs)
So, the sandwiches are
  relatively cheap.
The menus
  are definitely cheap.
So are you guys perceived
  in your marketplace as being
a really inexpensive place
  to go get lunch?
I'm gonna re-Articulate
  his question.
The menu looks like crap.
The logos are crap,
  the whole thing's crap.
Is crap the brand?
It's gourmet grilled cheese
  that--
That's given out
  at a reasonable price.
In this economy,
  everybody needs something
that they can take
  a family of five out to,
and we can do that
  at Tom + Chee.
You can come in
  And you can sit down with--
With all your little kids,
and everybody can have
  a great meal
and walk away happy.
You have 70 employees.
  What are your sales?
Our--Our two corporate stores,
  um, have grossed--
last year, we grossed 1.5.
1.5?
Million.
How much again?
  You sold $1.5 million
  of this stuff?
In the last 12 months.
  Very impressive.
We've actually done
  $1,400 in an hour.
They will wait
  an hour and a half
just to get up to order.
If I drove by your shop,
I'd see people lined up
  out the door?
Yes.
  Out the door.
Tell me what
  the franchise fees are.
Okay, So, uh, to get in,
  it's, um, $35,000.
And then, like, 7.5%
  comes back to us.
And our franchisee,
  he had to spend about
$250,000 to get
  his first store open.
How's his monthly sales doing?
Great.
  He did $100,000 last month.
Wow.
You know what I love
  about your business?
You have
  the most important ingredient--
the magic
  of any great business--
You've got a line out front.
  Yeah.
And I'm going to give you
  an offer.
I'm gonna give you...
half of the $600,000
for 30% of the business
if you can get another shark
  in on the deal.
I'm sitting here
  and I'm thinking to myself,
what's the odds that these
  two guys are gonna win?
And everything in my bones
  is saying This is a runaway hit.
This is a Winner.
I want to let you guys
  get a little more focused here.
Okay.
  My portfolio kinda goes
  the opposite way.
I-I really believe
  in healthy products,
so this just wouldn't be
  for me. I'm out.
Okay.
  Okay.
You know, I'm sitting
  on the fence here,
looking at this saying,
  these guys have come up
with something so outrageous
  that it worked.
I would have never thought
  this would have Worked, ever.
And it has. All right,
  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna throw 100 grand in
just to be a piece
  of this really crazy idea.
All right, I'm in on that.
  How much you in, Robert?
You have $100,000 or $200,000
  available.
  I'm in for $100,000.
Barbara, Robert, and Kevin
have made an offer, but trew
  and Corey need another $100,000
from the last remaining shark
  to reach the $600,000
they have asked for.
What are you thinking,
  mark?
You know you have
  the resources to help us grow.
We've done our research.
I'm not gonna do $100,000.
It's just not worth
  the time and aggravation.
But...
what I will do is
  I'll go in with Barbara.
I'll match
  Barbara's $300,000.
So each of us will put in
  $300k for a total of $600k,
for a total of 30% equity,
but I don't want
  all the sharks in.
That's just too much work,
  too much Hassle,
too much paperwork.
And in addition,
I want the rights
  to the state of texas,
just in case it takes off.
We actually have a--
  a very interested person
for Dallas already.
Well, then
  we'll carve out Dallas,
and if they don't close,
then that'll revert
  back to me.
And may I say
  I want new York?
Because I'm gonna be jealous
  of him carving that out.
(laughs)
I'm--I'm sorry, guys.
  I'm not in love with it enough
to compete and start
  to bid this thing up.
I just can't get there.
  I'm out.
I'll clear the field.
  You got Barbara, you got mark.
$300,000 each for 30%.
  What do you say?
I'd say we take the Deal.
  Yeah.
Yes, sir!
  Thank you, mark.
  This is gonna be awesome.
You gu--You were the two
  that we were talking about
the whole time.
  It's not easy being
  cheesy, right?
You know it.
  (laughter)
Good for you. Good for you.
  Thank you, guys, so much.
You gotta shave a little,
  you know?
  (laughs)
Would have never seen that
  coming.
Not in a million years.
Awesome.
  (laughs)
I've already got
  all the people in place.
I've got a buyer. I-I can
  take it to wisconsin cheese.
Good. You do all the work,
  I'll collect the profit.
It's a deal?
  No.
(laughs)
That's not a bad deal
  for $600,000.
Who's ready to make
  some cheddar? (laughs)
  (laughs)
one free call.
  And then afterwards,
our customers pay anywhere
  from 50 cents to $1 per minute,
depending on how many minutes
  they buy.
And then how do you pay
  the translators?
Translators make anywhere
  between $7 and $15 an hour
based on every minute
  that they translate.
What percentage
  of the 50 cents
you're collecting a minute
  is that?
Uh, we have a 70% margin.
And what are your sales
  to date?
In the last 2 weeks,
  we have had $10,000 in sales.
How long has it been
  on the market?
Verbalizeit has been live
  as of one month.
How do you filter
  these people?
How do you get these, uh,
  translators, and how do you
trust that they're gonna
  translate Correctly?
Uh, the first and foremost,
  we found 50 TRANSLATORS
by going out and talking
  to language learning centers,
and we said, "Okay, would you
  like to join our community?"
and then we got tremendous
  word-of-Mouth referrals.
Do you have a ratings system
  after the Call is over...
  yes, we do.
To rate the translators?
  We do. So you build up
  a reputation
as a higher-Quality translator,
  you make more money.
Wow.
  Our top translator made
$550
  in the last 2 days.
There are so many
  translation apps out there.
Why is this specifically
  different from everything else?
Well, on the one hand, you have
  machine-Based technology,
which just doesn't work.
And I'm gonna disagree
  with you there significantly.
Machine language translation
  does work,
particularly
  in a business environment.
So you have to go out
  and find translators
that understand business.
Because if we are doing a deal,
  and someone said
they've got
  a subordinated note
that has a buyout at 13%,
  and we're gonna do
a Cram--
  whatever it may be,
typical Translator's
  not gonna understand that.
Our community ranges
  from people
who have just graduated
  high school
to people who have their phds
  and their business degrees.
But you lose
  your instantaneous aspect of it
because that person
  has got to be available.
'cause it's not like
  there's an unlimited number
of those people
  willing to work cheap.
What does your business
  look like
in terms of the languages?
So we are live
  in Five languages, as I said.
Which five?
  Hindi, mandarin,
  spanish,
portuguese, and French.
Why not croatian?
  (sharks laugh)
We don't have a translator yet.
  How about joining us?
I got some time.
  We've only been live
  for a month,
and we're very excited with
  some of the large partnerships
that we're working on.
We just launched a pilot
  with Skype,
which means that any one
  of the 31 million Skype users
can add a verbalizeit translator
  into any conversation.
You've made that deal
  with skype?
  We have. We--
wow. Hang--Whoa.
Tell us how that deal works.
  Wow.
So we reached out to skype,
  given the--
the fact that
  they're a fantastic company.
We are now the featured app
  in the skype app directory.
Is it an exclusive deal?
Can someone else
  in your space come in
and also offer
  the same thing to skype?
Well, since we don't have
  an exclusivity agreement,
someone could technically
  come in.
I see.
There aren't a lot
  of companies out there
doing what we're doing,
  and we do have
a word-of-Mouth agreement that
  that won't be the case.
I happen to think
  that skype piece
is the sex appeal
  in the whole deal.
Creates a lot of confidence.
I really thought that was
  a real deal,
like you cornered
  the skype space.
So I'm out. 'cause... too shaky
  for me. I'm too scared.
So, guys, my other fellow sharks
  are asking a lot of questions,
because there's clearly gonna be
  some blood in the water.
This is really
  in their tech space.
But I'm gonna watch them fight,
and this is really
  gonna be good.
I'm out.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
um, software systems
  and servers in the business...
(clicks tongue)
  That's up to you.
which is all the more reason.
  That's not--
  That's also not True.
Yes, it is True.
  (daymond) All right, guys.
The line has been drawn
  in the sand.
These are hard offers
  by the sharks.
What are you gonna do?
Estamos pensando. Okay?
(lowered voice)
  What would you like to do?
(whispers indistinctly)
Mr. Wonderful,
  you have a deal.
Oh!
  Whoa.
Whoa!
  (Barbara) Surprise.
Looking forward to working
  with you guys.
  Likewise.
Wow.
  (Kevin) Very interesting.
Thanks a lot.
  (speaking indistinctly)
Take care. All right.
  Congratulations.
