First into the tank
  is Val Brennan,
who feels she has a way
  to find love
easier and faster.
My name is Val Brennan,
and I'm cofounder
  of three day rule.
We're requesting
  $200,000
in exchange for 10% equity
  in our company.
Now, we are changing
the way that Singles
  in Big cities meet.
I was a lawyer
  working 16 hours a day
on my career, and zero hours
  a day on my love life.
I just didn't have time
  for mass-Market dating sites,
which are filled
  with millions of profiles
that are fake, inactive,
  or people who I'd never date.
I also didn't have time
  to spend yet another
Friday night at a bar
  talking to a guy,
only to realize
  that he had a girlfriend.
I knew that I wasn't alone,
and I knew
  that busy professionals
deserved
  a better experience,
which is why we created
  three day rule.
Three day rule is unique from
  other mass-Market dating sites,
because everyone must be invited
  or must be endorsed to get in.
Think of it
  as a private dating club,
with the result being
  a quality pool
of extraordinary singles.
Here's how it works--
  People request membership.
They go through a competitive
  application process.
Once people are accepted,
  they take a quiz.
We determine
  what their type is.
They receive matches,
  and can start communicating--
even with me as the cofounder
  who is single.
But they can start communicating
  with other singles
and quickly go on dates.
We are ready to compete in this
  $3 billion market Opportunity
and help the 96 million singles
  in this country alone
find love.
Many questions, Val.
  First of all,
do I impute from your name,
  the three day rule,
that perhaps
  after Three dates...
I might...
  (laughs)
What am I--what's the word
  I'm looking for?
Love?
  Action.
Yeah.
  No, no, no.
(laughter)
  Guys, guys--
  When we read that,
we don't read
  "Three day rule."
We read "Three date rule,"
  you know?
Oh, three date rule?
  No, actually...
  Oh...
(laughs)
  Is that what you're
  implying?
No. Let's clarify
  any ambiguity.
So, the three day rule
  was this rule in pop culture
that people thought, "I can't
  call somebody For three days
because I'll seem
  too desperate."
Oh...
  and what that results in
  is people waiting by the phone,
not going out on dates, and not
  really meeting the real--
Do you validate
  any of that information?
We do validate
  the answers,
and we have additional premium
  services that we'll offer.
An additional
  revenue stream for us
beyond the subscription fee
  that we're charging
is actual validation.
So members will actually
  have a verified--
So unless I buy extra,
  I get the liars,
is what you're saying?
But, Robert, Robert,
  what's the criteria for women?
You don't think women lie?
I think women tend to be
  more honest in dating--
so you're saying Somebody
  puts on fake nails,
fake eyelashes, fake lips,
  and fake hair...
  (laughing)
They're not lying?
  (laughs) Good point.
  Good point.
Now, how many members
  do you have now?
We have about 10,000 people
that have submitted
  applications.
Paid the subscription fee?
No. We're pre-Revenue,
  so we're actually--
Oh, I love that word--
  "Pre-Revenue."
(laughs) We're actually
  in our data build.
What it means is you
  have no sales.
We launched
  about four weeks ago,
and one of the things
  that we wanted to do
was build up
  a core base of users.
So at this point,
  we decided that we will not
implement a paywall,
  as they call it
in the dating industry,
  until day Three.
  Yeah, but that's
  hardly a test.
Everybody jumps in
  without paying.
One of the things
  that we had
is we an earlier version
  of this business,
and what we had was a successful
  offline matchmaking business.
You had this business before?
  We did.
We had events, and we also
  had activities,
and we had matchmaking.
  And what happened
  to it?
So that business
  is still existing.
What's happening
  is we're actually
scaling that business
  to this online offering.
How much is a subscription?
$100 is the base subscription.
For a 1-year subscription?
  No, for one month.
So it would be $100
  per month.
  $100 a month?
Yes.
  But you haven't done that yet.
  You haven't proven that yet.
You--
  we actually have
  in our offline model.
How many members do you have
  in that original business?
So for that,
  close to 10,000 people.
(Barbara) and what's
  your revenue for that business?
From that, it was about
  $70,000 from last year.
Are you single?
I'm single, yes.
If you're single,
  maybe the product doesn't work.
No, it a-- (laughs)
  Aww!
(Robert) So, Val, how long
  did you do that model?
We did that model
  for about a year.
And you basically made
  70 sales?
Right, but we had events
  and activities also
where we collected
  a transaction fee
and a ticket price
  to attend our event, so...
  complicated.
Did you make money
  on the events as well?
  We did.
Is that a revenue generator?
The online/offline commerce
  industry is huge.
It's a $3 trillion industry.
  Val, I just don't
  understand one thing.
Other sites that we see on Tv--
  don't they all do...
(Kevin) they do.
  A similar thing?
No.
  What--what is
  the difference?
The difference is we actually
  screen people coming in
to the community.
  Those sites
  don't screen people?
They don't screen...
  okay.
So anybody with
  an e-Mail address can log on
to some of those
  mass-Market dating sites.
Just pretend you worked
  for one of those companies,
and we said, "One of your
  competitors, three day rule,
said you don't screen at all,"
  what would they say?
They probably would agree.
  Those--
No.
  Those companies
  are about volume.
No, I don't think so.
Val, all I care about
  is money, okay?
So--and you're gonna have
  to explain to me...
  yes.
How you make money
  at some point today.
  Absolutely.
So I'll take you down
  the path to revenue.
Members will pay
  $100 per month.
They're able to buy
  subscriptions
in one-Month, 3-Month,
  and 6-Month increments.
We estimate
  people will stay on
Probably between
  three and six months.
We will make anywhere between
  $300 and $600 per customer.
So, if you have
  200,000 members,
and you go across
  20 Major metropolitan cities,
by year 3, you have
  a $20 million business.
But you have
  no anecdotal evidence
that that's going to be
  your metric.
You know, Val,
  you have the perfect answers,
but they're all based
  on theory.
Um, I'm looking for
  a reason to say yes.
Because if there is
  a way to differentiate
and it's real,
  you got a home run.
I agree,
  and I think we do.
But you haven't proven that.
One last chance.
  Okay.
And don't tell me
  you have a questionnaire...
  okay.
And you have algorithms.
Tell me, what is it?
Our major selling point,
  our value proposition
is that everyone
  must be endorsed,
so there is social context
  around every member.
You know that
  that person has gone through
an application process.
  They've been approved.
You do understand you're
  valuing this at $2 million?
Yes.
  You're not in love
  with the valuation?
No, I don't think so.
I'll tell you a little bit
  about the valuation.
We already have investors
  already committed
and money in the bank
  at a $4 million valuation.
And that's--
  how much have you
  raised there?
We've raised
  a $150,000 stake.
  At a $4 million valuation?
Yes, that's right,
  but we realize
the value that you bring
  to the table.
So, Val, you know the saying
(Robert) So, Val... (sighs)
It's been
  an interesting journey.
  Okay.
You're very pleasant.
I feel like we're on
  a date right now. (laughs)
Oh.
I'm not clear,
  and I keep coming back to,
you're just another dating site.
  No, we're different.
We are different from
  the mass-Market dating sites.
But I don't think
  you explained that.
I was looking for you to say,
"Here's all
  the other dating sites,
but here's why I'm different."
And for me,
  you didn't do that today.
For that reason, I'm out.
You were not convincing here
  at all.
In fact, I would say
  you were confusing,
and I was listening hard.
And most importantly,
  the name is terrible.
Three day rule--
  I'm a girl,
and I even interpreted it
the way these guys
  interpreted it.
(laughs)
  I like that.
Third day, you better put out.
  I like that.
So for those reasons, I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Good luck, Val.
(Robert) You were dead-On
  about the name, though.
I love the name!
I think if she could
  guarantee the three day rule,
then she'd have something
  proprietary, mark.
is that it's not just about
  creating value,
it's also about
  capturing value.
So we'd like to understand
  a little bit better
whether or not mark and Robert
Can improve their offers
to beat
  Mr. Wonderful's offer.
I'll add one thing.
I have somebody
  who works for me--
All she does is
  machine language translation.
If you don't think 5% is worth
  just an introduction
to one of the most advanced
  Machine language translation,
not the language of building
  something of value.
You know what the good news is?
  I'll end up competing with them.
Bring it on.
In the end,
  it wasn't about the 5%,
but Mr. Wonderful just showed
  that he really understands
what our business
  is about.
We're really excited
  to be working with him.
