welcome to
the real world, mark.
No--
Calm down!
What is this, "kumbaya"?
Every time you get up here,
you take that opportunity away
Anna Trebunskaya
and Jonathan Roberts
and I'm the creative
sales and marketing guy.
And together,
we're an <i>unstoppable </i>force
that's overcome
every obstacle imaginable
and gluten-free
Ginger molasses.
(mark) It's really good.
No, I do know that, mark.
Oh, you do know? Okay.
So what got me interested
is because of
athletic performance.
Steve Nash and other athletes
now eat gluten-free,
so it's become
more mainstream.
But it's a very competitive
market,
as Kevin alluded to.
How much money do you make
on $1 million in sales today?
It's about 10%.
But we're nowhere
near scale
in terms of what
our profitability could be
in terms of cost and maximizing
our value on overhead.
How do you blow this up
so that you become
the brand for... sand
or whatever it is?
Okay, so that is
the opportunity
we have right now.
What's amazing about
our cookies is that
they're not the boxed,
sit on the shelf
next to 16 other brands.
This is a perishable cookie
that sits
in the bakery department.
How long is its shelf life
in that bag?
30 days
outside of the freezer.
What does it cost you to make?
About a dollar to make
one pack of two cookies.
So, two cookies are costing
what at retail?
$3.99 to $4.99.
(Daymond) That's a lot.
That's an expensive cookie.
You know, this is where
the price
of this category lives.
If you go and you get
a single gourmet
allergen-friendly cookie,
it's gonna cost you 2 bucks.
Do you have
a retail location in Vermont?
No. Actually,
the one retail location
that we tried
to put together
was destroyed three days
before opening
by hurricane Irene
in a flood.
We lost $15,000
and a whole summer's worth
of long nights
building things.
Did you think you were going
to survive through that
when that happened?
I mean, we are the most
relentless businesspeople
you're ever gonna meet.
That was the smallest setback
that we've survived.
Yeah.
Yeah, we've had--
We've had a lot of knocks.
When the recession hit,
it really hit our business.
We couldn't pay our loans.
We called the bank and said,
"we don't think
we can pay next month."
So what did the bank say?
"When are you gonna pay us?
We're gonna auction
all your stuff off."
That's the goal. We need to
get over that $10 million mark
to make this
a saleable company.
It's a big stretch.
Well, Mark...
You know, I've always said
sales is the best market.
The way I market
this product
is I get cookies
into people's mouths,
I get cookies into the store,
and they look fabulous.
We also have,
and I love this--
Mark, we're gonna go
a little higher
than we were comfortable
going,
because we'd really like
to have you as a partner,
and we're gonna say--
Ask you if, uh,
you would do $200,000
for a 20% stake.
Morning, girls.
Since making my deal
with Mark Cuban,
the growth has been
off the charts.
We went from just $100,000
in lifetime sales
to over $800,000
in just a few months.
I like it, dude.
They're looking good.
We're on pace to do
$1.5 million in sales
through our web site alone
this year.
Hey, mark. It's Stephan.
Mark Cuban
is amazingly accessible.
I created
a guerilla marketing campaign
and I hustled,
and after a lot of hard work,
I was able to get in
four of the top retailers
in America.
Now, the only thing
I wasn't prepared for
were the politics
of retail.
So I definitely took
a few hits along the way.
But every fight led me
to here today in front of you.
Everyone that sees Rock Band
loves Rock Band.
That even goes
for the rich and famous.
You don't even have
to take <i>my </i>word.
You can take it from the voice
of the rich and famous.
That's right, sharks.
(laughter)
(Mark and Daymond) OHH!
No--Ohh! Here you go.
is that I own
the trademarks.
Something came up
just recently--
a very well-Known
italian company
is launching in America.
They called me,
and we signed a contract.
They're gonna launch
under the name Rock Band.
So you licensed Rock Band
to them?
Yes.
It's called Rock Band by...
(speaks italian).
And they did $1 million
last year,
and they're think--
That's in Europe,
and my share is 40%
of all U.S. sales.
I'm sorry. They're gonna
give you 40% of net,
correct?
All U.S. Sales.
Of profit?
Gross or net?
Some of the negotiation
is about helping
in cost of manufacturing.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
If they sell $100,000
worth of product--
Gross sales--Will they
give you $40,000,
or, after everything
is paid, said, and done,
will you get 40%
of the total profit?
Meaning maybe $10,000.
Uh, as it stands,
of the profit. You're right.
And you mentioned something
about politics of retail?
I had a large P.O. agreement.
How large was
your purchase order?
Uh, 150,000.
After it was manufactured,
well, they did in fact cancel.
Isn't a purchase order
a contract, though?
That's what <i>I </i>said.
And I was told, kind of,
um, "Sue us."
Walk me through the economics
of all this and this.
$12, and it, uh...
$12 for--everything in This
is $12?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Including the case?
Yes, sir.
And what do you sell it for?
Um, that wholesales at $50,
and then retails--
Suggested $99 to $150.
Great margin.
How many units have you sold
in the last month?
A dozen a week. And I know
that's not impressive. I--
actually, it's not so horrible
at 150 bucks a pop.
I give you $100,000 today--
What are you gonna do with that?
30% will probably go to,
like, Web site optimization.
30% has to go to a-a lawyer
to protect the trademarks
that are already being
infringed of mine.
So what you're saying is,
you've had to fight
the game company that did
"Rock Band" the game, right?
Well, obviously, they have
the rights to do electronics...
right.
'cause that's not my field,
but what I have is clothing.
Oh, so you want to sue <i>them</i>
for making--for the clothing?
Yeah--I wouldn't say "Sue."
I would just say,
"Hello. Remember me?"
yes, of course.
We don't want to say
anything harsh.
(Kevin)
I want to make you an offer.
How about I give you $100,000,
and I buy Rock Band from you?
All of it. The whole thing.
(chuckles)
And I pay you
for the rest of your life
Mark and I, uh, invested in some
girls named Litter last year...
I was very aware of that.
And they are doing incredible.
If... mark agrees,
I'll give you the first $50,000
if he gives another $50,000,
and we would want 40%.
I don't like it.
Of course you don't like it,
because it's far better than--
'cause it doesn't
make sense.
It makes total sense.
The opportunity here
is to leverage
the two together.
(mark) Lee, let me--Let me
quantify this for you.
Your challenge is...
back offers.
Fulfillment and back offers.
We've already done this,
so you'll be able to step
right in and just go to work.
the worst element
of business.
Welcome to
the real world, mark.
No! Look, if you're not
part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.
I am the solution!
That is absolutely
part of the problem.
This is why we have patents!
This is why we have law
in this country.
No, no, no, no.
You know what you do?
You out-compete.
Why have you not been able
to just kick their butt
because you're
a better company,
you're a better solution,
and you're a better execution?
And that's the position
I've taken this entire time.
Here's what I see--
You hit a roadblock.
And how you respond
is exactly what guides
your future.
Mm-Hmm.
Unfortunately,
it sounds like
you talked
to too many lawyers,
talked to too many kevins,
and you were rudder-Less.
And someone
who's coming in
is probably gonna
have to come in
and do more pooper-Scooping,
and I don't wanna be
in the pooper scooper business,
so I'm out.
I'm looking at you
and thinking of myself
at different crossroads
along the way,
where people stole my stuff,
things got in the way.
And I just had to persist,
and I see that in you.
What I'm not sure I trust
in you is your judgment.
Okay. Well, Barbara,
if you invest in me,
I will do whatever
you tell me to do.
But I have
no interest at all
in being the entrepreneur
for your business.
I'm an investor...
Mm-hmm.
An advocate,
but I'm certainly not
gonna solve all your problems.
I will not quit.
And I see the vision
for this company.
I've had a lot of challenges,
from divorce to, uh,
to manufacturing issues,
to... you name it.
It's just not
in my D.N.A. To quit.
I'm sorry to say
I am out.
Okay. Thanks.
Daymond, I'm winking at you.
You know, when you first
started talking all that poo,
you attracted
a really big fly over here.
Yeah.
But peeling back the layers
on this onion,
it's starting to stink...
Mm-hmm.
And I'm out.
Okay.
You seem to be looking
for a lifeline.
Mm-hmm.
I like to invest
in businesses
that are in upswing.
I think once a-a stone
starts rolling down a hill,
it's very, very difficult
to stop.
I'm out.
Tell me if any
of the assumptions
I'm going to make now
are wrong.
You're an innovator.
You practically created
the cloth diaper business.
I did.
Yet at the same time,
everybody else
took a huge part of it,
70% of it away from you.
Mm-hmm.
Some of that's your fault.
It just is.
I started this industry,
I grew it,
I did all of the footwork--
Look, I admire
your tenacity,
but I don't wanna join you
on your...
on your ride.
I wish you
the best of luck,
but I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I didn't get a deal
from the sharks,
but I'm not upset with them.
They told me the truth,
and they didn't do it from
a good business perspective.
But you know what stopped me
from getting a deal?
All of the I.P. squatters
out there
that are making tons of money
off my idea.
So...
Just look out.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Mike Lane.
And my name
is Matt Franklin.
Our company is PostureNow,
and today we are here
seeking a $100,000 investment
for a 15% equity stake
in our company.
We have two very special guests
to show our product--
Anna Trebunskaya
and Jonathan Roberts
Wow.
Don't get jealous, Mark.
God, that's so beautiful, huh?
Yeah!
Wow!
(cheering)
Well done. Well done.
(Mike) Nailed it.
Mike, can she do
the rest of the pitch?
(laughter)
Yeah, please. I would love that,
believe me.
Now we asked
Jonathan and Anna
to join us today...
In fact,
Mike's wearing one right now.
As you can see,
it is two neoprene arm bands...
(laughter)
We're still laughing at it,
just so you know.
When your shoulders
slouch forward,
it provides a gentle reminder
to keep your shoulders back
and your back straight.
It looks like "used by
law enforcement everywhere."
(laughter)
Yeah. No kidding, right?
I-I initially came up
with the idea
because I was looking for a way
to get rid of my beer belly
without actually having
to stop drinking beer.
And I noticed that when
I stood up straight,
my belly would
magically disappear.
And one of the biggest
surprises we found
as Mark here might attest, yes?
Couldn't attest to,
actually.
Yes. He has the experience.
Have you tried it?
And another market which
we're just starting to hear from
is H.R. departments
of--of--Of huge
fortune 500 companies
that are like,
"This is preventative."
So how many corporate orders
did you get?
We have no corporate orders,
just inquiries.
Oh, you've <i>heard</i>
from them.
Something we want
to target.
Okay. Well, these guys
like to talk about what's wrong.
Let's talk
about what's right.
Let's do. Thank you.
I'd love to do that.
Okay. Let's get into
some real details here.
Okay.
You've done $330,000
in sales.
You've said
your net margins are 40%.
So you're making $132,000,
basically.
So you guys--
You're splitting it
and you're putting it
in your pockets?
Yeah.
Pretty much, so far.
I mean--
What are your real jobs?
Are they anything
to do with posture?
I-I'm a--I'm a sales director
for an art handling company,
so we--You know...
and I own
a little videography company
where I do
corporate training films.
Why did you not reinvest
that $132,000 into the business
since you already
have other jobs?
Well, to be honest, this was
kind of more of a Hobby.
with the idea that
there is a market for this.
I think it's
sort of semi-Interesting.
I'd give you 100k.
I want 50%.
I also want--
Not gonna happen.
(Daymond) Whoa.
Not gonna happen.
You haven't heard
my offer yet.
Whoa!
It gets better, my friend.
I--Well, I've heard enough.
I've heard enough.
It gets better.
It gets better.
Let's--okay.
I'll hear you out, Kevin.
Always listen, all right?
$100,000 just doesn't
fall out of the ceilings.
Understood.
All right.
I'll give you $100,000.
I want 50%.
I want a star attached,
that comes out of your hide.
All right?
Okay.
And I want a 10% royalty
on Every unit sold.
If you own half the business,
why would you want a royalty?
I have to get
some cash flow back.
How do I get my money back?
How does it come back?
No. I would not
do that.
Whoo!
Whoo! Let's give him
a round of applause.
I just wouldn't do it.
No way.
So--So far I'm the only guy
that offered you anything.
But it's just
too much equity.
And I think you know that.
Well, what do you think
is a fair amount of equity?
Uh, the offer I made--15%.
No, that's insane.
That's what
I think's fair.
This is not worth
$600,000 right now.
Why not?
Because you haven't
proven it yet...
we've proven it
two years!
As a business.
It's sold $300,000!
You haven't proven
anything.
Yeah.
You put $5,000 into it.
Patent pe--
We took $5,000
and turned that into $330--
$5,000, patent pending,
and it's worth $700,000 now?
That's--Absolutely.
Well, then
you don't need the money.
You shouldn't
be here then.
This stage is for people
who <i>need </i>money and need deals.
And every time
you get up here,
you take that opportunity
away from somebody
who <i>really </i>needs it,
who appreciates the offer
of $100,000.
You know what? I-I'm--I'm not
begging for anything.
I'm offering something.
Oh.
Ooh.
Mark, we haven't heard
from you yet.
Well--
Whoa! What am I,
chopped liver?
Exactly. I-I--
"Thanks for your offer,
But, mark,
what do you think?"
Matt, there's a reason
you don't talk!
(laughter)
Robert, thank you
for the offer,
and we'd like
to consider it.
Are there any other offers?
They are working the room.
You know what?
I'm gonna pull my offer.
Because it seems like you're
trying to work <i>me...</i>
(exhales)
So I'm gonna work you.
But you know what?
That's a good thing.
Let him go.
It's that simple.
Here's where I'm at--
Absolutely. In fact--
Absolutely. We actually--
Sometimes it pays
to listen.
Isn't this wonderful?
All roads come back to me.
No, actually,
the undertaker--
We already know
what's happening with you.
I understand
on the equity.
Because there's 2 of you,
50% partners,
and if you give up 40%,
it just doesn't feel right.
So 35% for Matt,
35% for, uh, Mike,
and 30% for Mark.
But because there's
an evolutionary life, um, scale
for the product,
I do want a royalty.
Ouch.
Of $5 per unit,
only until
I get my money back.
Then it ends,
with the expectation you--
Mike, you have to quit your job.
Okay.
You have to tell me now.
I'm not gonna
get into a bidding war.
How do you feel?
I feel great.
We're in!
And I quit my job!
Let's do this!
I quit my job!
I don't have to
go to work on tuesday!
(Barbara) Sorry!
(laughs)
Thanks, mark.
Appreciate it so much.
Thanks, mark.
Appreciate it.
You are two smart guys.
(Anna) Bye!
(Jonathan) Take care.
(Barbara) Bye, Mike!
(Mike laughs)
I didn't think they were
gonna go for the royalty.
I didn't think so, either.
I like you on that one.
I like that.
