I don't think the guy sleeps.
He's behind this company 100%.
Ready, set, go!
(cheering)
(Stephan)
the "Shark Tank" experience
has really jumped my career
ahead probably 20 years.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,
and this is just the beginning.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Lee Dahlberg,
and I'm the owner,
designer, and creator
of a company called
Rock Bands.
Today I'm seeking
a $100,000 investment
for 20% equity in my company.
Sharks,
I've developed a brand
that not only has people
looking good,
it has them feeling good
as well.
It's called Rock Bands,
and as simple as it sounds,
it is indeed
a rock on a band
that makes a Rock Band.
(laughs)
A little deeper
than that... (chuckles)
I use stones
that have healing elements.
Now, each Rock Band comes
in a backstage equipment case
from a rock concert,
keeping with its theme,
inside revealing the meaning
of your individual stone.
Now, each Rock Band
is hand-Carved
by a family of artisans
that's been carving
since the Ming dynasty.
(lid closes)
I created the first few
Rock Bands for me,
and I had some friends
that really wanted them,
and then <i>their </i>friends
really wanted them,
and I thought, maybe I've
got something here.
So I jumped in.
I sold my house
to begin the company.
Rock Bands by Lee Dahlberg are
the hottest thing in Hollywood.
Oh!
Rock Bands can be seen
on the celebrity wrists
of Bono, Johnny Depp,
Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie,
Tommy Lee, Britney Spears,
Lindsay Lohan,
even President
William B. Clinton,
and... me, Robin Leach.
Rock Bands--
The ultimate expression
of Champagne wishes
and caviar dreams,
individuality, and fashion.
Love that, Robin.
(Barbara) Wow!
We loved it.
Good job, Robin.
Very impressive.
Good luck.
Lee, how did you get him?
Um, we've been friends
for years.
Sharks,
I've taken the liberty
to create a Rock Band
for each of you...
Oh, cool!
Based--
Based on your
individual personalities.
Awesome. Thank you, Lee.
This is for you.
This is for you.
You brought out Robin Leach.
You got our attention.
Ah, exactly.
What do you have
for Mr. Wonderful?
Oh. You are a special one.
I hope it explodes.
(laughter)
Yeah. Yes. Here you are.
Ooh, I like that.
(chuckles)
So--So, Lee, you said
they had healing powers.
Yes, sir?
Do you have any idea
the history of people
who've come into the tank
talking about healing powers?
No--
No, I'm not the great wazoo.
You're not selling these
as medicinal
in any way, are you?
No--at the end of the day,
if it's a placebo,
it makes everyone smile.
Tell--Tell us about
your sales.
Sales. I've done about
$300,000 in sales.
Over what period?
Five and a half years.
What are sales gonna be
this year, Lee?
It all depends.
The one thing about the brand
Lee, I think you're unlucky.
This went wrong,
that went wrong,
and luck tends not to change
around businesses.
(laughs)
Are you kidding me?
(Barbara) I hope I'm wrong.
That is--
(Robert) You know what?
That is such crap.
Come on. You make
your own luck in life.
Don't tell the guy
he's unlucky and he's doomed.
I don't think you're unlucky.
You just got a shark
to offer you $100,000 cash.
I'm gonna join Kevin
on half his offer.
(laughs) "I don't want
to work you.
No, no, no.
There's everything wrong,
but I'm gonna go in, because..."
I was about to call her a witch,
but I'm taking that back now.
Oh, no.
Because I'm going to partner
with Barbara on this.
You get two sharks.
You get a shark and a sharkette.
50/50.
What are you gonna do?
Listen to the whispers
real quick.
(laughs) Smart man.
(Daymond)
Here's what I'm thinking.
I'm interested
in the business.
All right, so, Lee--
Listen, Lee, you've got
to make a decision.
You have a real offer here,
all right?
Sure. We just don't want
to be--
got a lot of noise--
You've got a team here
that's been licensing masters.
Barb's proved herself on
television a zillion times now.
(Kevin) she's gonna put this
on television.
Oh, this is a shoo-In for qvc.
And I think that's why we'll be
able to do a great deal.
(Barbara) But, Lee, think about
one other thing.
You're an artist at heart.
If you were to just
unload this business
and collect your check,
you're free as a bird
to develop your next dream,
the dream after that.
You're gonna have Kevin
and a real estate agent
designing jewelry after that.
Why would you wanna stay with
both feet in the business?
It's all attractive
in its own ways.
I-I see the benefits
of both, honestly.
That alone is proof
that you ought to be
walking out of this business.
Anybody's who's married
to a business
never sees the benefit
of walking away.
He's just being objective
and just analyzing
what's in front of him.
No. His heart's not in it.
Wow. Really?
Lee, I'm gonna make
one last statement,
and then I-I may actually
recant the offer.
I think that we can
license as well,
if the opportunity
provides itself,
but we will also let you work on
your dream instead of saying,
"You've been doing this
for three to five years. Leave."
Can we make sure
that the licensing
is an actual part of it--
absolutely. We're gonna--
Everything.
It's your company still.
You own 60% of the company.
So I'm gonna let you
answer us yes or no right now.
And you'll be inspired...
(Kevin) Lee, you have
to make a decision.
To seek out these
licensing deals?
You have to decide.
Basically, as long as you're
in--in the same interest
of licensing--
Yes, we will license it.
Absolutely.
Absolutely?
Absolutely.
Yes or no?
Yes.
Good job.
Done deal.
Huge opportunity missed.
Good job, Lee.
Looking forward to it.
Absolutely.
All right, thank you.
Appreciate it.
All right.
Just because
we didn't make a deal
doesn't mean
you can't root for me.
Come on.
Put your hand in there.
(laughing)
Put your hand in there.
Thank you.
Good job, Lee.
Looking forward to it.
(Kevin) Huge mistake.
(Lee exhales)
He's unlucky? Well, his luck
just changed, Barbara.
(Daymond)
His luck just changed.
His luck just changed.
Daymond, I'm not happy.
(laughs)
The lining is polar fleece,
so even though
the pad inside is wet,
the lining is staying dry,
so the baby's more comfortable,
and less diaper rash.
The outside is waterproof,
so everything stays
where it belongs.
Now let's talk
about the washing,
because I know
everybody wants to know
what do you do
with the poop?
(laughter)
So it's easy.
If it's solid poop,
it just plops right on
into the toilet,
where it belongs,
by the way.
It's never solid.
(laughter)
I'm getting there.
If it's less than
the ploppable variety,
