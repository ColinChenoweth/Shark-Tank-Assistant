welcome to
the real world, mark.
No--
Calm down!
What is this, "kumbaya"?
Every time you get up here,
you take that opportunity away
No, I do know that, mark.
Oh, you do know? Okay.
So what got me interested
is because of
athletic performance.
But it's a very competitive
market,
as Kevin alluded to.
How much money do you make
on $1 million in sales today?
It's about 10%.
But we're nowhere
near scale
in terms of what
our profitability could be
That's the goal. We need to
get over that $10 million mark
to make this
a saleable company.
It's a big stretch.
Well, Mark...
You know, I've always said
sales is the best market.
The way I market
this product
is I get cookies
into people's mouths,
Mark, we're gonna go
a little higher
than we were comfortable
going,
because we'd really like
to have you as a partner,
Morning, girls.
Since making my deal
with Mark Cuban,
the growth has been
off the charts.
We went from just $100,000
in lifetime sales
to over $800,000
in just a few months.
I like it, dude.
They're looking good.
We're on pace to do
$1.5 million in sales
through our web site alone
this year.
Hey, mark. It's Stephan.
Mark Cuban
is amazingly accessible.
I created
a guerilla marketing campaign
is that I own
the trademarks.
Something came up
just recently--
a very well-Known
italian company
is launching in America.
30% has to go to a-a lawyer
to protect the trademarks
that are already being
infringed of mine.
So what you're saying is,
you've had to fight
If... mark agrees,
I'll give you the first $50,000
if he gives another $50,000,
(mark) Lee, let me--Let me
quantify this for you.
Your challenge is...
back offers.
the worst element
of business.
Welcome to
the real world, mark.
No! Look, if you're not
part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.
I am the solution!
That is absolutely
part of the problem.
This is why we have patents!
This is why we have law
in this country.
No, no, no, no.
You know what you do?
You out-compete.
Why have you not been able
to just kick their butt
because you're
a better company,
Hello, sharks.
My name is Mike Lane.
Wow.
Don't get jealous, Mark.
God, that's so beautiful, huh?
Yeah!
Wow!
(cheering)
Well done. Well done.
(Mike) Nailed it.
Mike, can she do
the rest of the pitch?
(laughter)
Yeah, please. I would love that,
believe me.
In fact,
Mike's wearing one right now.
as Mark here might attest, yes?
Couldn't attest to,
actually.
Yes. He has the experience.
Have you tried it?
with the idea that
there is a market for this.
I think it's
sort of semi-Interesting.
I'd give you 100k.
I want 50%.
I also want--
Not gonna happen.
(Daymond) Whoa.
Not gonna happen.
You haven't heard
my offer yet.
Whoa!
It gets better, my friend.
I--Well, I've heard enough.
I've heard enough.
It gets better.
It gets better.
Let's--okay.
I'll hear you out, Kevin.
Always listen, all right?
$100,000 just doesn't
fall out of the ceilings.
Understood.
All right.
I'll give you $100,000.
I want 50%.
I want a star attached,
that comes out of your hide.
All right?
Okay.
Mark, we haven't heard
from you yet.
Well--
Whoa! What am I,
chopped liver?
Exactly. I-I--
"Thanks for your offer,
But, mark,
what do you think?"
Matt, there's a reason
you don't talk!
(laughter)
Robert, thank you
for the offer,
So 35% for Matt,
35% for, uh, Mike,
with the expectation you--
Mike, you have to quit your job.
Okay.
You have to tell me now.
I'm not gonna
get into a bidding war.
How do you feel?
I feel great.
Thanks, mark.
Appreciate it so much.
Thanks, mark.
Appreciate it.
You are two smart guys.
(Anna) Bye!
(Jonathan) Take care.
(Barbara) Bye, Mike!
(Mike laughs)
I didn't think they were
gonna go for the royalty.
I didn't think so, either.
I like you on that one.
I like that.
