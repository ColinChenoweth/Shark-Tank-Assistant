Hi. My name is Tereson Dupuy,
How long you been
doing it, Tereson?
12 years.
12--Wow.
Whoa.
12 years.
Wow.
What are
your sales last year?
Last year,
they were $3.9 million.
Whoa.
(Barbara) Wow.
But I've sold
$24 million worth
with no advertising,
word-of-mouth only.
Where are they sold?
Internet sites.
No retail?
No big-box retail,
but we have boutiques.
How much profit did you make
on $3.9 million?
$20,000.
Oh!
Why is it so low?
Because I had
manufacturing problems.
We went overseas,
into China,
thought it was gonna
be a good thing,
until they took
all of my product,
patterns, et cetera,
