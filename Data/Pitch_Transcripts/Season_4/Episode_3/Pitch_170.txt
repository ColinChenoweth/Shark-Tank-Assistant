Hi. My name is Tereson Dupuy,
and I am founder and C.E.O.
Of Fuzzibunz Diapers.
I am here asking
for a $500,000 investment
for a 15% equity stake
in my company.
This trash represents
the 1 ton of garbage
that one baby generates
in disposable diapers
by the time
they're potty-trained.
Disposable diapers make up
the third largest consumer item
in landfills today.
One disposable diaper takes
up to 400 years to decompose.
But, sharks,
I do have a solution.
Fuzzibunz are a 100%
reusable diapering product
that is easy to use
and easy to wash at home.
They save parents over $2,500
on their diapering cost,
because you only need
12 Fuzzibunz
in comparison
to 8,000 disposables.
They also keep
babies drier,
uh, more comfortable,
rash-free,
which is why I created them
for my own Baby 12 years ago.
So Fuzzibunz
are a pocket-style diaper.
There's a pocket in the back
that you insert
a microfiber pad into.
How long you been
doing it, Tereson?
12 years.
12--Wow.
Whoa.
12 years.
Wow.
What are
your sales last year?
Last year,
they were $3.9 million.
Whoa.
(Barbara) Wow.
But I've sold
$24 million worth
with no advertising,
word-of-mouth only.
Where are they sold?
Internet sites.
No retail?
No big-box retail,
but we have boutiques.
How much profit did you make
on $3.9 million?
$20,000.
Oh!
Why is it so low?
Because I had
manufacturing problems.
We went overseas,
into China,
thought it was gonna
be a good thing,
until they took
all of my product,
patterns, et cetera,
handed it over
to somebody else,
so now she's
competing with me.
I can't even tell
the two products apart.
Kevin, are you paying attention
to what she just said?
Hey. That's why
you have a patent, my friend.
I have a patent,
but it wasn't very strong.
When I first started out,
I had no money,
couldn't afford
a good patent attorney.
And your factory
just gave this to her?
Yes. She was in Hong Kong.
She was my distributor.
Wow. The story
gets even worse.
I mean, you're in--
You're in the poo-poo business,
and poo-poo happens.
Yes, it does.
Did you Sue?
We are suing.
Wow. You know, in my business,
people always tell me you can
sue anybody for anything,
but good luck collecting.
(Daymond) Correct.
Right.
What do you think'll happen
to your sales
if by magical force,
your patent's successful
and you shut her down?
What incremental sales
would you get
as a result of it?
70% more.
Whoa.
Wow.
And you think your sales
would go up 70%?
Oh, yes.
Not just from her,
from <i>all </i>of the people
that are squatting.
Well, tell us more.
Whoa, sorry.
Seriously?
Who else--Who else
is squatting?
(Daymond) Who else?
A lot of people.
If you combine 'em all
and roll 'em up,
how much do you think
annual sales are?
I would say, if I had
to give a good average,
probably selling
between $30 and $40 million.
Total?
Whoa!
Okay. Hold on here.
They're all
breaching your patent?
Yes.
Now This is where
poo-poo really happens.
Mm.
Because frankly,
this is
a very hard business.
You've gotta get retail,
you've gotta get distribution,
you have inventory issues,
manufacturing issues.
Or you work with
my army of lawyers,
who sues everybody
into the stone age
until they agree
to a license deal.
That is the slimiest,
the nastiest,
