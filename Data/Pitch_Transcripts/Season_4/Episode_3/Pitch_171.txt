of "dancing with the stars."
Wow.
I don't like it.
(birds chirping)
(cattle lowing)
My name is Dan Holtz.
And I'm Liz Holtz,
and we live
in Warren, Vermont.
And we're the founders
of Liz Lovely Cookies.
(Dan) Liz Lovely Cookies
are all-natural, gourmet,
vegan, gluten-free cookies.
They're the best
you're ever gonna taste.
Dan and I are
high school sweethearts.
We've been together
almost 20 years.
You wouldn't believe
the hardships
we've overcome
to stay in business.
Okay, a little to the right.
We survived the recession,
and we survived
tropical storm Irene
when our retail store
was destroyed
three days before
We were gonna open.
It destroyed
all of our product--
The whole store--
But we're unstoppable,
and we just kept going.
(Liz) Hi, Micki!
(fussing)
Last year, Dan and I adopted
our baby daughter Mccartney,
so now more than ever we need
help to grow our business.
If we got an investment
from the sharks,
it would mean that all of our
hard work will have paid off,
and we'll have the resources
to make Liz Lovely Cookies
into a household name.
(imitates explosion)
(laughs)
Hi, sharks.
I'm Liz Holtz.
And I'm Dan Holtz,
and we're the founders
of Liz Lovely Cookies,
and we're seeking
a $200,000 investment
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
(Liz) a couple years after
the dot-com crash,
we were out of work,
in debt,
with unemployment
running out fast.
Meanwhile, I filled the freezer
with cookies
for friends and family.
The outcry was unanimous!
Everybody wanted more!
(laughter)
So, we started over
in the green mountains
of Vermont,
baking decadent cookies
using artisan techniques
and only the best ingredients.
Liz is the amazing baker,
to build a brand around
Liz's trade secret recipes
that omit
traditional ingredients
like wheat flour,
milk, butter, and eggs.
That's right. My cookies
are gluten-free and vegan.
Dan and I know
these are cookies
you sharks can really
sink your teeth into.
So, who wants a bite?
Absolutely.
I have one quick question.
gluten-free, dairy-free,
egg-free.
What are they made out of--
Sand?
(sharks laugh)
The products are made out of
a blend of rice flour
and some starches,
but don't let that fool you.
Liz, what are
the three different
flavors we're looking at?
(Liz) okay.
The one with the chocolate
is cowboy.
Then you've got
gluten-free chocolate fudge
Oh, I like the cowboy.
Is there nuts in it?
(Liz) Walnuts.
You see, that's the difference
between the cowgirl cookie
and the cowboy cookie,
is that the cowboy has nuts.
(laughter)
That is delicious. Wow.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And your sales?
Last year, we did just under
$1 million in cookies.
Wow.
(Daymond) ooh!
I wouldn't eat these
unless I had to.
They don't taste that good.
(laughs)
(Kevin) Why would
anybody eat this
unless they had to?
(laughter)
Well,
you're in the minority
thinking that
they don't taste good,
'cause lots of our customers
are not gluten-free.
Let me tell you this.
So, one in three
U.S. Households
is now catering to someone
in their house
who has to eat gluten-free
for one reason or another.
So this is
the best of the cookies
you wouldn't eat
unless you had to?
The very best.
(Robert chuckles) No.
You don't know this,
but I'm a gluten-free mogul.
And Dan and I decided
the only way
we're out of business
is if someone comes
and literally takes the seat
from under our butt.
You know, we were
out of money,
we were out of time,
but we just fought
and fought and fought.
We got really creative.
We built an e-commerce site,
and we just
sold, sold, sold,
and since then
we've worked our way up
to just under $1 million
last year.
How are you distributed,
and what percentage
of your sales are wholesale?
So, 90% of the sales
are wholesale, at least.
We are distributed
by the--the country's
largest natural foods
distributor.
We were just at the I.D.D.B.A.
trade show in New Orleans.
Essentially, every single person
that walked up to the booth
said, "We're looking for this.
This is great.
This is the best gluten-free
thing we've tasted yet."
Wow, you know, you're a good--
You're a good salesman.
(Daymond) You are
a good salesman.
Maybe they all just wanted
a free cookie.
(laughs) Yeah.
Did you get any actual
hard orders?
You--You don't get P.O.s
in the food industry
until you're ready
to deliver.
It's just not how it works.
You're a great salesperson,
so I-I think you guys work
amazing together.
Um, I-I have to be honest.
I really didn't like
the cookie.
I'm not saying it was bad,
but I wasn't in love with it.
And I have to be passionate
about something I invest in.
So I'm out.
Dan, I'm not as convinced
about the growth strategy.
I think that there's gonna be
a lot of competition.
I think you have
a journey ahead of you,
and I just don't want to go
down that journey.
Um... today, I'm out.
Um...
you're a <i>very </i>good salesman.
I have the ultimate respect
for the sales guy,
'cause that's what I am,
I'm a salesman,
and it's really hard.
You're good.
I just hate your product.
I'm out.
(Liz) It's down to you, Mark.
It's just you and us.
And I know that you're
into the gluten space.
And I-I have about
$1 million worth of business
that I'm percolating
just from one trade show.
I've got three
major grocers on the hook.
I've got a handful
of little guys,
and I've got a lot more
selling to do.
I know you hate
P.R. companies.
I know that you
can't stand schwag.
We don't do
any of that crap.
Dan.
Yes, sir?
Let him go.
You know, I feel like--
I feel like you guys
aren't getting it.
And I'm not sure
what it is I'm doing wrong,
but this is a huge opportunity.
We're--the time's--
Man, you can sell.
I like everything
you've said.
One issue.
Valuation.
Okay, well,
let's talk about that.
What do you think
it's worth?
You know, I'm gonna let you
make me an offer.
I use this all the time.
I'll do the 24-second clock
spiel and all that,
and I'll say, "Here's my offer.
Take it or leave it."
Right? You got 24 seconds.
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna flip it.
Okay.
Make me an offer,
and I'll say yes or no,
and it'll take me
less than 24 seconds.
So, Liz and Dan.
(chuckles) Yes.
You're gonna only get
one shot at this.
This is what I call
a yolo moment--
You only live once.
(chuckling)
What are you gonna do?
I don't we've ever seen this
in the tank before.
You're the first.
You either win big,
or you really screw it up.
Let's go.
and, I mean, they were
impressed by Dan,
but I just didn't feel
like they got us.
So I'm willing to give you
$150,000
for 30% of the company.
Let's do it.
Whoo!
a 7% royalty on everything
I commercialize with that brand.
And by the way, I have
a whole bunch of lawyers
to take care of all
the problems of people
that have messed around
with our brand.
I'm sure your letterhead would
scare them a lot more than mine.
(chuckles)
No, I-I help encourage them
to do the right thing.
No, of course.
At the end of the day,
I could make a lot of money
with this.
I'm not sure the rocks sell,
so I don't really care
about that.
But I care about the brand.
Of course.
I could license this brand
in a lot of places.
we have a handy-dandy
diaper sprayer
that attaches
to a toilet,
parents can just rinse off
whatever's left over,
they put it in this mess-free
hanging diaper pail,
and then when they're
ready to wash,
you unzip the diapers
into your washing machine,
including the bag,
and your hands stay clean.
Thank you.
Feeling these really
makes you believe in them.
The color of money
for you.
Thank you.
Kevin, how's it compare
to the one you're wearing?
(laughter)
So who's ready
to invest in Fuzzibunz?
Stop generating
tons of trash,
and start generating
tons of cash.
of "Dancing with the Stars."
(Barbara) Ah.
(Robert and Barbara laugh)
to show the importance
of posture in ballroom dancing.
And good posture's not only
critical for ballroom dancing,
it's critical
for everyday life.
Unfortunately, today,
we're hunched over our computers
and our mobile devices,
and poor posture has become
a worldwide epidemic.
PostureNow is a simple device
that can be worn inside
or outside of your clothes.
is how the dance community
has really embraced PostureNow.
Yeah, Well,
posture and timing
in dancing is everything,
Well, I'm actually wearing it
right now, as I'm dancing.
Really?
Really?
Oh, 'cause you really
needed it, right, Jonathan?
(laughter)
You know what?
You can always get better.
How long have you
been selling these?
Or <i>Have </i>you been
selling these?
We've--to date, we've sold
about $330,000 worth.
Whoa.
Whoa.
And how much
do you sell them for?
Uh, $39.95.
What does it--
What does it cost to make?
Costs about $5 a unit.
So what's
your wholesale price?
We--We do wholesale also.
Wholesale price is $19.95.
How are you
selling them right now?
Internet only.
Every month on Google,
there are over
1 million searches
for "posture"
And posture-related keywords.
Are--Are chiropractors
and doctors
gonna get behind this and say,
"This is good for your back"?
I can't say they're
gonna get behind it,
but they've been
buying the hell out of it.
And you're saying
this company
is worth now
about $700,000?
$650,000. Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what we value at.
Okay, $50,000
between friends, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, it's a lot of money
you're asking for this company.
I mean, you are
stacking the deck,
because you have Anna
and Jonathan in here talking.
Yeah. Why not?
But the only problem
is if they weren't here--
But you know what, Daymond?
They <i>are </i>here.
How much money have you guys
invested to this point?
Initially, we put
about 5 grand on a credit card.
Oh, $5,000 now
is worth $700,000.
I like those numbers.
These guys are drug dealers!
Hey, it's a great business.
Only in the shark tank can you
create that kind of wealth.
(Barbara)
So you do have a patent?
We do.
A utility patent.
And you only spent $5,000?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Pending.
It's--It's pending.
Oh, patent <i>pending.</i>
Ohh! Pending!
But also, we've gotten
some really good support
from chiropractors.
And so now we're starting
to realize
this could be
really, really big.
It's a hobby.
You're pulling out some cash.
But, you know,
if I put money in,
I wanna know you're gonna
do it full-time.
I want to be the first guy
to quit his job
on--On national television.
(laughter)
You have tantalized me
So may I have
a little celebratory dance?
Yes. All right.
Yeah.
If you don't mind,
Jonathan?
Go for it.
(laughter)
You deserve it today.
And, Jonathan, I'm not
gonna ask you to dance.
That's all right.
(laughing) I really don't
know how to dance.
