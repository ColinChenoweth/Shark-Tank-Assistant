Kevin, are you crying for...
(laughs) For all those chickens
that lost their lives?
Dave, Dave... (laughing)
When was the first time you
stuck a chicken in a blender?
(sharks laughing)
Hey, I married him
for this dip, so...
He's truly crying.
Oh!
I'm thinking about all those
chickens that lost their lives.
There's only two chicken breasts
per tub, so it's really...
(all laughing)
I-I have to say...
Oh! I'm sorry. (laughs)
(Mark) Oh, man.
(Kevin) Oh!
While they gather themselves,
it...
it really is delicious.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, lord. Sorry.
(Lori) um, okay.
Okay. All right, we're back.
We're back.
No problem.
All right, now we've shed
some tears for the chicken.
Tell me about your business.
or sooner
if Kevin keeps laughing.
(laughter)
Pop right out. (laughs)
man, you got a lot
riding on this dip.
Is it always
a positive reaction to it?
The lifter hamper is for
the elderly--right, Kevin?
Look, Brian,
h-Here's where I'm at.
Um...
I think it's very clever.
You know, I have little kids.
I think of the Tetra Pak.
(Kevin) Ah.
Whoa.
Good growth.
I do.
(Kevin) 100%?
(Lori) With no partners?
100%?
No, no.
We've got one other investor.
They're in at, uh, 17%.
(Kevin) Whoa.
So this is a down round for you,
basically?
Excuse me?
A "down round" meaning
$5 million for 17%
values the company
at about $30 million.
Yeah, why are you going down?
Because we need the cash
right now.
Hang on. You put in $4 million
of your own.
You go out,
you raise another $5 million,
giving the company
about a $30 million value.
Your numbers are on fire,
fantastic growth.
(Kevin) How much inventory?
How much you have in inventory?
We've got close to $2 million
in inventory.
The numbers
just don't add up for me.
They don't add up because
if your sales are that strong,
you shouldn't be holding
$2 million in inventory.
Exactly.
We built, last year,
a little too much
for the Christmas season,
