Kevin, are you crying for...
(laughs) For all those chickens
that lost their lives?
Dave, Dave... (laughing)
When was the first time you
stuck a chicken in a blender?
(sharks laughing)
Hey, I married him
for this dip, so...
He's truly crying.
Oh!
I'm thinking about all those
chickens that lost their lives.
There's only two chicken breasts
per tub, so it's really...
(all laughing)
I-I have to say...
Oh! I'm sorry. (laughs)
(Mark) Oh, man.
(Kevin) Oh!
While they gather themselves,
it...
it really is delicious.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, lord. Sorry.
(Lori) um, okay.
Okay. All right, we're back.
We're back.
No problem.
All right, now we've shed
some tears for the chicken.
Tell me about your business.
or sooner
if Kevin keeps laughing.
(laughter)
Pop right out. (laughs)
man, you got a lot
riding on this dip.
Is it always
a positive reaction to it?
Do People ever look at it
and go, "Ew!"?
I think--
I do think at first,
they'll take a sample,
they'll keep walking,
and then they turn around
and they go, "Wait a minute.
"wait a minute.
What did I just eat?
'Cause that was amazing."
And then when people find out
it's a blended chicken,
they don't have a problem
with it?
They love it. Actually, they
gave us really good feedback.
They think
it's a really clever idea.
I agree with that.
I think it's wonderful.
I mean, I really liked it.
I just really wanna go take
another one...
(laughs)
And have it over here.
I also love the two of you.
I think you're both great.
I really, really wanna
help you,
but I'm just not sure
that I'm the right person
to help you get this
into supermarkets everywhere.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Guys, I think you're gonna
do wonderful things,
but I also know that to be
a great entrepreneur,
you have to know
what you're good at
and know what
you're not so good at,
and I'm not so good at
food distribution of this sort.
So as much as I-I love what
you guys are doing,
because it's not a fit and it
doesn't play to my strengths,
I'll have to say I'm out.
I admire your just
stick-to-it-iveness to survive
getting whacked from your job.
This is happening
to millions of americans now.
It's a tough economy out there,
then coming back with something
that's actually working,
you're basically
living off this,
but as an investment
for a startup, basically.
And so there's a huge amount
of risk in it right now.
I could put a royalty on it
and force you to pay me
on every time you sell one,
but that's just cruel injustice
to those chickens
that have given up their lives
in the first place.
(all laugh)
But as an investment...
I'm sorry. I'm out.
You know, I-I loved the story.
I admire what you've done.
Here's the good--
you know the product.
Lori likes it.
I think a lot of people like it.
Here's the bad--
It's a brutal business.
You need a partner that can
help you go down that road.
All I can offer you is--
is advice, encouragement.
But I can't tell you when
to zig or when to zag,
and I think that's what
you really need today.
I wish you the best. I'm out.
I appreciate that.
I appreciate that a lot.
This is a...
very, very hard decision
for me.
There's a guy who came
on the show last year
named big chef shake.
I was in love with him and in
love with the--the concept,
but I didn't have enough
knowledge of the business,
and then he went off and did
$10 million in business,
and good for him.
Absolutely.
Daymond.
You know,
I've been sitting here.
I really like you guys. There's
just something about you.
I would like to come back in.
The lifter hamper is for
the elderly--right, Kevin?
(Mark and Robert laugh)
dig him, baby. Dig him.
So instead of having
to put your back into it,
take a load off
and let the lifter hamper
do the work for you.
So who's with me?
That's great.
Can I try it?
Yeah.
Can you put a bottomless amount
of, uh, peanuts in there and...
(laughs)
(laughs) Have it come up.
Can you put it by a bar?
Yeah. There you go, right?
So if I keep
taking things out...
Yeah.
Can I do this?
Yep.
It's gonna just keep coming up?
Yep, and you have
a comforter in there.
And coming up.
Is it working, Lori?
Yeah.
Lori, what is it
made out of?
You know, I don't know.
If feels really cool.
(Mark laughs)
(Daymond and Kevin) Whoa!
But--One second--
we have signed two contracts
with two
of the biggest rep firms.
Rep firms? Not a store?
Yeah. And we have contracts
with Amazon and Overstock.
We had one with Costco.
We had to scale back
'cause we couldn't fulfill.
My name is Brian Fleming,
the handsome one.
And I'm Kevin Fleming,
the smart one.
Our company is bag bowl.
? Bag bowl ?
? bag bowl ?
? bag bowl ?
we are seeking $40,000
in exchange for a 33% stake
of our company.
After
a thorough design process,
we have perfected
an exoskeleton
that provides structure
to the amorphous blob that is
a standard 2-gallon,
1-gallon, quart,
and sandwich-sized
zipper bag.
By inverting the top
of the zipper bag
and sliding it down
the sides of the bag bowl,
consumers can create
a handy and sturdy bowl.
A great way
to flat-pack consumables
and take them on the go.
And when they're finished,
simply zip up the contents
and throw it into the cooler,
fridge, or cupboard.
Or if it's empty, into the trash
or recycling bin.
Wait a minute.
No more cleanup?
No more cleanup!
(laughs)
The picnic, potluck,
and tailgate
will never be the same.
Or how about a convenient way to
get pasta sauce from the stove
to a bag? Ooh!
Ahh!
No more mismatched lids
for bulky plasticware.
(clatter)
Oh!
Ah. (laughs)
What an advantage for, say,
a chip or a peanut manufacturer
to utilize our technology
to offer their customers
an exclusive way
to turn the bag into a bowl.
Yeah! Or How about pioneering
a single-serving
dog food product?
Woof! Woof!
Now you're talking, bro.
(sharks laugh)
Bag bowl brings convenience,
function, and style
to modern living.
Our humble goal is to change
the way the world consumes.
Who wants to join us and be
a new Fleming brother or sister
and help us take the bag bowl
global?
Can we see it?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Here you guys go.
As you can see, it folds
totally flat when not in use.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome. Thank you.
Does this come apart
right here?
No, that's
the ultrasonic weld.
Uh, it can be microwavable
with certain kind of polymers.
Guys, how much have you invested
to create this?
We've put in $40,000
of our own money.
But before the train gets
too far down the track,
well, let's tell you what
our plan is for this business.
We are looking at
a licensing play for bag bowl.
Brian and I were considering
manufacturing it.
When we looked
at all the resources
that was going to take,
we thought,
instead of shaking
one apple tree,
why not lease out
the entire orchard?
But isn't it a niche market?
Because I have a bowl already
in my home, all right?
So if I buy a bag of chips,
I pour them into the bowl.
The chip company is not going to
increase its cost by 20 cents
to provide one of these.
They already sell their chips
and they're successful.
Mm.
The guy who sells a bag of
anything is already selling it.
He doesn't need to provide
the service
to create a bowl for you.
Bowls are ubiquitous in homes.
This is for tailgating,
maybe.
I'm just not sure there's
a real demand for this.
I don't know if you've seen,
though,
where packaging is going
these days.
Everybody's wanting to be able
to eat right out of the package
that you're eating,
and right now
it's not an elegant process
because...
and that is the problem...
the top does not open up well.
Because you're pushing
the burden of the cost
back on the manufacturer,
and that's a trend that is--
They're not gonna like.
The cost does not--
We've talked--
We've talked to gigantic plastic
packaging manufacturers
in our homes--
and what did they say?
2 cents to add this structure
to the bag. It's negligible.
Listen, to the consumer goods
package business,
2 cents is a lot.
They hire people--
dozens of them--
To cut costs
by 1/8th of a cent.
But, I mean, look at the scale
of this business.
Do you guys know
how many plastic bags
are used in the country?
But what is to stop
somebody else
from just doing this?
We have a utility patent written
on the product, and, uh--
you have a utility patent
already issued?
No, we're
patent-pending still. Yeah.
It's pending.
That doesn't mean
it'll ever issue.
Ah.
Look, Brian,
h-Here's where I'm at.
Um...
I think it's very clever.
You know, I have little kids.
I think of the Tetra Pak.
I think the person who invented
a square and easy way
to drink juice boxes
made a lot of money
from something that was
no different--
Yeah, because it cut cost of
glass bottles, that's why.
No, they made--Oh,
and they made it easier.
I can see this selling.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you the $40,000
for 45%.
I'll help you with getting
a couple companies
to make a licensing deal.
And I think I can help you
get it off the ground.
Well, thank you. That, uh--
so you're saying
this 3-Inch hula-hoop
is worth $100,000 now,
the company?
You know,
I think it's a great idea
or It's not, but what I like
about it, Daymond, is we can...
so you'll take--
It's a flier?
You're gonna take a gamble
on it?
Make a couple of calls and we
can find out very quickly.
Can I get up and look?
Absolutely.
Yeah, absolutely.
Lori, are you interested?
I'm looking.
Why should she not be, Daymond?
She's attractive and she likes
attractive gentlemen.
(chuckles)
Keep sucking up.
So you just stick it down in...
yep.
And you just go like this?
Mm-hmm.
When you fold this over
the side of it,
it actually acts like
a-a ring around a barrel
and helps give it stability.
(Robert) Lori, how is it?
How--is it easy?
It's easy.
Thank you.
Uncle Ben's has a 90-second rice
that comes out of the microwave
in 90 seconds.
It's a great product but imagine
the Uncle Ben's product
being able to turn
into a bag itself
as opposed to the headache
that you create
pouring it into another bowl,
and then saying,
"now I have to wash that bowl."
I don't agree
with the licensing thing.
I think that if you show this
off and try to get it licensed
to a lot of companies,
they're just gonna knock it off.
I don't think you're gonna
get the patent.
But all that being said,
I can get products made,
into market,
and onto my show on QVC,
and sell hundreds of thousands
of dollars within minutes.
I think this is
a great tv item.
Last season,
I took a guy who came in
with a piece of steel
and a magnet,
and we've now done
almost $3 million in sales
in the last year.
I think it's possible
that we might be able to do some
Really big numbers with this.
That being said,
I will give you the $40,000
for the 33% stake
in the company.
What do you say?
You're gonna give them exactly
what they asked for, right?
I'm gonna give them exactly
what they asked for.
Could we have a minute to...
(Kevin and Robert
speak indistinctly)
she gave you what you offered.
What are you gonna discuss?
Yeah. Yeah, go have a minute.
See what happens.
Wow.
You're taking a huge risk
by walking out the door.
She gave you what
you asked for.
Guys, you walk out of here,
I'm pulling my offer.
It's amazing that you would even
stop for a minute...
no, we didn't--
no, I was just getting--
To think about it.
We would love to do
the deal with you, Lori.
Thank you.
Good.
Great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's so exciting.
Yeah, I'm very excited.
Great. Great to be working
with you.
I think it'll be great.
Thank you so much.
Great.
Whoo!
(Mark) Whoo-Hoo!
Talk to you soon.
Thank you, guys.
Yeah! (laughs)
(laughs)
Whoo!
Here's a little advice
for all the Mavericks players--
don't call him "Cubes."
(laughs)
The guy flips out.
We chummed the water,
and, uh, it looks like
we got a little bit nipped
in the leg a couple times.
But in the end, we swam
right out of there with a deal,
and we couldn't be
more stoked.
(Kevin) Ah.
Whoa.
Good growth.
And what are you on track for
this year?
Uh, about $7.2 million.
Nice.
And will you net
when you do $7.2 million?
Yeah, I'm glad you asked.
Me, too.
This is the exciting part.
(chuckles)
We will net, uh,
right at $2 million,
after--
This is after all of your costs,
paying yourself,
all your employees?
Yes.
Are you gonna spend
that $2 million also,
put it back in the business?
Because you basically have
the $2 million
you're asking for.
I've never taken a salary
from the company.
Uh, I've actually put money
in the company myself.
Uh--
how much?
Uh, I put in, um,
right at $4 million.
(Robert and Daymond)
Of your own money?
Yeah. Yeah.
(Kevin) And how much
do you own of it?
Well, you'd get
that money from?
I, uh, in 2000,
I sold a business
that my wife and I
had built.
We built it from zero
to about 300 employees,
and we were able to exit--
what kind of business?
Uh, it was, uh,
early learning centers.
Do you own the company yourself?
I do.
(Kevin) 100%?
(Lori) With no partners?
100%?
No, no.
We've got one other investor.
They're in at, uh, 17%.
And how much did they put in?
$5 million.
(Kevin) Whoa.
So this is a down round for you,
basically?
Excuse me?
A "down round" meaning
$5 million for 17%
values the company
at about $30 million.
Yeah, why are you going down?
Because we need the cash
right now.
Hang on. You put in $4 million
of your own.
You go out,
you raise another $5 million,
giving the company
about a $30 million value.
Your numbers are on fire,
fantastic growth.
And you're running out of cash?
Yeah.
(Lori) Why are you running out
of cash?
Something smells
a little funny here.
The other part is we actually
developed another product.
Ah!
We've developed
a product that
we won three innovation awards
just this past January.
And it's not this?
No.
It's called
Lifestyle Connect,
and it does everything
that this does
but it will monitor--like,
low energy heart rate monitors,
blood glucose monitors,
and fall detectors.
(Kevin) How much inventory?
How much you have in inventory?
We've got close to $2 million
in inventory.
The numbers
just don't add up for me.
They don't add up because
if your sales are that strong,
you shouldn't be holding
$2 million in inventory.
Exactly.
We built, last year,
a little too much
for the Christmas season,
and we didn't sell through
all of them.
So what's happening now--You
guys tell me if I'm wrong here--
You got too excited
during the Christmas season,
you built too many.
Now you've got this big crush
of inventory,
and you think your solution is
to go out and raise $2 million
so you can get out
from underneath your inventory
and get to your new product.
Continue this product and...
(Daymond)
but wait, wait, wait.
We'll--We'll decide if we want
to bring the new product.
But wait, there's more.
I'm like a bloodhound.
Let me--Let me ask you
something.
How much did you spend on R&amp;D--
Research and development?
All the money that we've
ever invested in the company
we've put back
into the company.
I didn't get the answer.
Just, how much do you think
you spend in R&amp;D
over the last three years?
I don't know
the exact number.
Would you say that you spent
about a million... or more?
I really don't know
the exact number.
You can--You had $9 million.
You gotta know where it went.
Yeah, you should--I mean,
a million between friends...
you gotta know.
I get it. But... under a million
or over a million?
I would say over.
(Mark and Daymond) Okay.
(Mark) When you got started,
did you go through the approach
of go and hire
some marketing M.D.A.S,
put together
a marketing program?
Marketing guys, sales guys.
And you raised
all this money
because it was go big
or go home?
Yeah. Yeah, we--
and you guys wanted
to hit the home run,
and you got a triple...
(laughs)
Yeah. Yeah.
But now you're stuck.
Steve jobs had a dream.
He wanted a computer
on every desktop.
And my dream is to have a Zomm
or a Zomm product
with every cell phone.
And your dream is killing you.
You went too big
and tried to hit a home run
when a single would
win the game.
Yeah.
And that's why I'm out.
You sure?
I'm positive.
You've done two things
most people have never done
that get in front of us.
You've raised $9 million
and you've done $5 million
in sales,
and your company is basically
about to die,
and you don't even know it.
I gotta tell ya, I wouldn't give
you $2 million of my own money.
I'm out.
I have to take my hat off to
you, creating a great business.
But I think that
if I go into your books,
it's gonna be horrific.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Lori?
Yeah?
Mr. Wonderful?
I think what you've done
is brilliant.
I think it's a great product.
Problem for me is that
where you are right now,
needing to ask us for money,
it tells me something's wrong.
And for that reason, I'm out.
