My name is David Mealy,
and this is
my wife DomiNique.
"Nique" for short.
Look at me!
We live in Tampa, Florida,
with our son Austin,
and we are expecting
our little girl Caroline
in about two weeks.
Nique and I have been married
for five years.
I met her my very first weekend
here in Florida.
I landed a job with actually two
of the largest golf companies
in the country.
But soon after that,
the economy went into the tank.
At that point,
my position was eliminated,
and I lost my job.
We knew we had to come up
with something quickly,
something that would generate
an income for us.
I always wanted to cook.
I wanted to be a chef, actually,
before I got into
the golf career,
so I decided to go after it
to start a little
barbecue catering company,
try to make some ends meet.
We worked day and night.
(indistinct conversations)
Everyone who tried our food
loved it,
but there was one dish they kept
asking for over and over again,
and we knew at that moment
that we had a hit.
And it was kind of that
lightbulb, so to speak.
We're like,
we--we have something here.
Now we really need
the sharks' help
to bring our product
to the masses.
Once the sharks taste
our signature dish,
they are going to love it
and not be able
to get enough of it.
Hi, guys. My name's David Mealy.
And I'm Nique Mealy,
and our company is back 9 dips.
And this is Caroline.
(giggles)
(sharks chuckle)
We're here today
seeking a $150,000 investment
in exchange for
a 15% equity stake
in our company.
But before we go any further,
we're gonna let you taste
what our company is all about.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Did you know that
over super bowl weekend,
americans consumed over
1.25 billion chicken wings?
And the second most popular
snack food that weekend
was chips and dip.
Well, what you're
currently tasting
is an array of Back 9's
buffalo chicken dips.
We take all-white Meat
chicken breasts,
your wing sauces,
dipping sauces,
blend them together,
creating everything you'd get
in a chicken wing on a chip.
So this is basically
a chicken slurpee?
It's a protein-based dip.
You know, I have to say,
it's delicious.
Thank you.
Do you remember the bassomatic--
You threw a bass in a blender?
(sharks laughing)
You throw chicken in a blender.
(laughs)
I'm visualizing sticking
that chicken in a blender.
(imitates blender whirring)
Mmm! That's good chicken!
No different than
your chicken being chopped up
on your salad
that you have for lunch.
We just grind it up
a little bit and...
(laughing)
It's actually
our number one ingredient.
After a life-changing event
with me and David,
we went ahead and started
a catering company
called Back 9 barbecue.
And while barbecue was
my specialty,
we quickly became known
for our dips.
So we decided to bring
these dips to retail,
where we built
a very loyal fanbase,
from the college students
all the way to
the Mr. Wonderfuls of the world.
What was
the life-altering event?
Well, last time when I was
eight months pregnant,
David--He had lost his job.
And I didn't have a job, so we
did what a lot of people do,
and we downsized from
a very large, beautiful house
to a very small house.
We have one car now.
We sold off a lot of things
to make sure we kept a roof
over our head.
But it's actually
all worked out...
it's been a blessing.
For the best. It really has
been a blessing.
It was.
So now this is your livelihood,
this business?
It is.
Tell us about
the sales of it.
How much do you sell?
How much money do you make?
We're approaching $400,000
in--in less than 2 years.
We're also approaching
about 400 accounts right now.
We just landed
our first supermarket,
a big chain down in--in Florida.
They gave us a 60-store test.
They gave us a number to hit,
a weekly number.
We're hitting that--
How's it's going?
We're hitting that number daily.
Wow.
Our product--the reason
that it sells so well
is because of the quality
of the ingredients.
People will pay
for a premium product.
That's the biggest reason.
And it's--It's pricey
to put quality ingredients
together.
What does it cost for one?
It retails anywhere from $7.99
to $8.99 for a 1-Pound tub.
And what are
you making it for?
It costs us roughly $2.52,
and I wholesale for $5.25.
And how much do you have
invested into the company?
We got about $150,000 invested.
That takes a lot of guts
when your back's
up against the wall,
to believe in it enough
to build it.
And yeah--and you have--
and you have
another one coming.
And you have children
and another one on the way?
We have a 3-year-old son
and then our daughter
will be here in two weeks,
Come here. Hug me.
(Nique laughs)
You better not.
Sorry I'm so hormonal.
Ohh!
(laughs)
Good job.
Thank you very much.
But you know what I will do?
My card will be there
for you guys and them,
and anything I can do.
'cause I know you guys
are gonna make it. Okay?
I appreciate it.
Give me a hug.
You remind me of my wife.
Oh! She's a good woman, then.
Congratulations, guys.
Good job.
Caroline!
(laughs)
She's going to college.
She's got some new friends.
(laughs)
Everyone needs a chance.
Everyone needs a chance.
(sniffles)
I can't believe I cried.
(cries)
Last season,
we saw Fleetwood Hicks strike
a half-million dollar deal
with Mark Cuban
and Barbara Corcoran.
For his specialty
bicycle company Villy Customs.
Anyone from ages 8 to 80
can go to our Web site
and create their bike
the way they want it to be.
Let's see what he's up to now.
Within 24 hours, we had
over 85,000 unique visitors
to our web site.
So we're actually exceeding
projections again this month.
Before "Shark Tank,"
in a year's time,
our sales were $215,000.
And already
in the past five weeks,
we're doing over $100,000
in sales.
We put the $500,000
to great use.
We've hired several employees.
We've completely revamped
our Web site.
We have all also bought
a ton of inventory,
so we're ready
for all the orders.
Being on "Shark Tank"
has really allowed us
to take Villy Customs
to a whole nother level,
and that is awesome.
What is the unique property,
though,
to patent
of a circle of plastic?
Um, well, as you know,
sometimes, uh, the best,
most ingenious patents
are sometimes
very simple innovations,
like the post-It note or the end
of the shoelace things--
Small things that in aggregate
make life a little bit easier.
Our patent is designed to be
a structural...
exoskeleton.
The exoskeleton for a plastic
bag to folds over the sides.
I mean, I think you guys
are great,
and I think this is
really clever.
I just don't think
that you're gonna get
any intellectual property
on it.
Where do you sell this? Are you
currently selling this anywhere?
We went to a trade show
in Chicago, the I.H.A. show,
which is one of the biggest
housewares shows in the world.
We know--we know what it is.
So everybody saw this?
Everybody has seen this.
Out of 2,000 booth spaces,
we were one of 30 that received
a prestigious award
called the design defined award.
People loved it.
The feedback was overwhelming
and tremendous.
Once people saw us do the flip,
everyone had that "Aha" Moment--
did you take orders?
How many people--Yeah,
how many orders did you get?
How many stores Wanted--
Uh, we just took feedback
from that.
We went to that show with
a proof of concept in mind.
You did not get orders.
The answer's "None.
But you won an award.
So was that romancing the truth
and just saying,
"No, we have no sales"?
(chuckles)
Well,
we're a pre-Revenue startup.
But, I mean, look at...
(laughter)
The scale of this business.
So it's actually
dancing around the truth...
yes. Yes.
Instead of saying,
"No, we have no sales."
No, we're at the beginning.
We're at the beginning.
It's a pre-Revenue startup.
Exactly!
Hey, the guy's being honest
with you.
(mark laughing)
Exactly.
So it's pre-order,
pre-revenue...
pre-patent.
Pre-does anybody want it?
Pre-order, pre-patent,
pre-everything.
Pre-calling somebody
to try to license it.
Right.
It's completely virgin snow,
and you guys are at
the top of the mountain,
and we can ski powder
all the way down.
You guys are slick, right?
You found a niche. How big
it could be is debatable,
but you guys are great
at debating it.
But it's all about making
somebody else do the work.
I see you guys
not as entrepreneurs
But as want-repreneurs.
Cubes, let me--
Let me jump in there.
"Cubes"?
Cubes? Just for calling me
"Cubes," I'm out.
I'm calling him "Cubes"
From now on.
We can get from "A" to "B,"
No doubt about it.
But we are here
at the Shark Tank
to get your access,
your expertise.
You guys have no sales,
uh, no patent,
no history, and you want us
to call on your behalf
and you want our friends
to call us morons
when we pitch all of what
you're saying to them. Right?
Well, we are--
We're not looking for you
to impugn your character.
And if you think that
that's the kind of ridicule
you would get
from your, you know,
pitching this to other people,
then, you know,
that would speak volumes
about the partnership
we could have.
And there's the bottom line.
So if I'm not running with it,
I'm running from it.
But--
I'm out.
I understand. Um...
I ain't mad at ya.
The greatest consumer
Innovations and products
and success stories and profits
and wealth
come from ideas that do
two things--
Solve Problems
and reduce costs.
Right.
This idea does neither.
(Daymond) Mm-hmm.
So... I'm out.
(mouths word)
