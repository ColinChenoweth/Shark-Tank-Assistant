My name is Marvin Philip.
I'm from Draper, Utah.
I was drafted to
the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006.
Three years into my NFL career,
I injured my back.
That forced me out of the game.
(blows whistle)
go. There you go.
Single file, single file.
Come on, low! Try it again.
Let's go zone left.
The best way I knew how to stay
in the game was to coach.
(laughs) Hey!
Whoo!
Pick up your feet!
Because of my back pain, I was
unable to bend over at all.
Even the simplest chores,
like doing laundry,
was difficult.
Ah. Thanks, mom.
I had looked for months
for, you know,
for a simple product
that would help me,
Hello.
My name is Marvin Philip.
Marvin, do I get
the whole thing?
The--the frame, the cover,
everything?
Yeah. Yep.
Lori, would you buy this
for your house?
I don't know.
I-I think it's interesting.
But how you gonna get that
down to your washing machine?
You're gonna need another hamper
or a basket or something
to go from bedroom or closet
or wherever you have that--
You wheel it. It's got wheels.
Yeah, I didn't see wheels.
So--so as you see
on the bottom,
there's wheels
on the bottom.
It's not wheeling great
on that rug, though.
Can you show it on the wood?
Yeah.
But if you are going
from upstairs to downstairs,
that's not going to be easy
to transport
for the people that need it,
because they can't bend down.
Yeah.
So...
all right, good point, Lori.
This needs some perfecting.
See, that's what
I'm looking for.
I'm looking for a mentor to
advise me on what I should do
and what the next step
should be.
How long have you been
doing this?
Uh, six months.
Oh, that's all?
Yeah.
You--You--
It's kind of impressive.
You know a--you know
a fairly large amount
of the business
in six months.
I'm trying.
Marvin, your company is not
worth the value of $700,000.
Now either you got hit
too many times,
or you really have a lot
in sales.
Actually, we haven't
hit market yet.
But, Marvin, this is
an agreement, basically,
Marvin,
to the Pittsburgh Guy.
(laughs)
Give us the economics.
What does it cost to make one?
Um, what--what are you selling
for wholesale? Retail?
Okay.
Marvin,
I like it, actually.
I've herniated two disks
in my back from sports,
"This is a great product.
Place this product for Marvin,
So, Marvin,
here's the good news.
I gotta tell ya,
I think it's a clever product.
Here's the bad news--
You've got a long way to go.
Marvin...
I don't think it's investable,
Marvin. Not right now.
Marvin, you come in here,
(Mark) Good luck, Marvin.
(Lori) Good luck. Keep thinking.
Thank you.
(Robert) Hey, Marvin,
that's not true.
Nice guys finish first
all the time.
There you go. (laughs)
There you go.
Me not getting a deal today
will--
Will make me work
that much Harder
to get this product out there
