My name is Marvin Philip.
I'm from Draper, Utah.
I was drafted to
the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006.
Three years into my NFL career,
I injured my back.
That forced me out of the game.
(blows whistle)
go. There you go.
Single file, single file.
Come on, low! Try it again.
Let's go zone left.
The best way I knew how to stay
in the game was to coach.
(laughs) Hey!
Whoo!
Pick up your feet!
Because of my back pain, I was
unable to bend over at all.
Even the simplest chores,
like doing laundry,
was difficult.
Ah. Thanks, mom.
I had looked for months
for, you know,
for a simple product
that would help me,
and I was very shocked
to find out
there weren't any products
out there.
And so that's when I decided
to design something myself.
Can you give me your
payment information as well?
Being an entrepreneur
is definitely new to me.
Being able to get a deal
with the sharks
and get that mentor
would be so beneficial to me.
You know, I'm excited to be back
in the game of life.
My new product has definitely
lifted my spirits.
When you see it, you'll be like,
"Man, why didn't I think
of that?"
Hello.
My name is Marvin Philip.
I am the creator and founder
of the lifter hamper.
I'm asking for $85,000
in exchange for 12% equity
in my company.
In 2006, I was drafted to
the Pittsburgh Steelers
from Cal Berkeley.
In the third year of my NFL
career, I suffered a back injury
that put me of out football
for the remainder of the season.
Not only
did my football skills suffer,
but my laundry skills
suffered, too.
(laughs)
Simple things like bending over
to retrieve clothing
out of the bottom
of the hamper
and carrying
those heavy loads of laundry
from one room to another
became Literally...
(thud)
a pain in my back.
That's when the idea of
the lifter hamper came about.
What the lifter hamper is,
is a bungee spring-loaded liner
that drops as clothes
going in gets heavier
and rises as the clothes
coming out gets lighter,
therefore allowing
the individual
to pick off
the top of the hamper
rather than the bottom.
Now the lifter hamper isn't
just for injured NFL athletes
like myself,
but it's for anyone who
has trouble bending over.
The lifter hamper is for
the 65 million americans
that suffer from back pain.
The lifter hamper
is for pregnant women.
Marvin, do I get
the whole thing?
The--the frame, the cover,
everything?
Yeah. Yep.
Lori, would you buy this
for your house?
I don't know.
I-I think it's interesting.
But how you gonna get that
down to your washing machine?
You're gonna need another hamper
or a basket or something
to go from bedroom or closet
or wherever you have that--
You wheel it. It's got wheels.
Yeah, I didn't see wheels.
So--so as you see
on the bottom,
there's wheels
on the bottom.
It's not wheeling great
on that rug, though.
Can you show it on the wood?
Yeah.
But if you are going
from upstairs to downstairs,
that's not going to be easy
to transport
for the people that need it,
because they can't bend down.
Yeah.
So...
all right, good point, Lori.
This needs some perfecting.
See, that's what
I'm looking for.
I'm looking for a mentor to
advise me on what I should do
and what the next step
should be.
How long have you been
doing this?
Uh, six months.
Oh, that's all?
Yeah.
You--You--
It's kind of impressive.
You know a--you know
a fairly large amount
of the business
in six months.
I'm trying.
Marvin, your company is not
worth the value of $700,000.
Now either you got hit
too many times,
or you really have a lot
in sales.
Actually, we haven't
hit market yet.
But, Marvin, this is
an agreement, basically,
with the rep company,
and they're just saying
they can maybe get you into
Amazon and Fred's and Costco
and these places.
So yeah--
But--but there's nothing saying
that they did it.
This is just like
a "We'll try it." That's it.
The big question
on that, Lori, is,
are they charging you
up front?
No. They get commission
on the back end.
Marvin,
to the Pittsburgh Guy.
(laughs)
Give us the economics.
What does it cost to make one?
Um, what--what are you selling
for wholesale? Retail?
Okay.
It costs about $10 to make,
and it retails for $49.99.
You have a patent
on this thing?
We were provisional, and then
we just filed our utility.
How much money
have you invested so far?
$75,000.
What did the money go to?
To the tooling,
the patent, and design, you
know, to get it to this point.
Is that a lot of money for you?
Yeah, you know,
not every football player
in the NFL is a millionaire,
you know?
And So, uh...
you know, it is.
No, I didn't--I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.
I'm just--you know,
I just wanna understand
how committed you are to it.
This is my full-time job.
I'm committed.
And--and you know what?
It means a lot to be because
I suffered a back injury,
and I still have trouble
bending over.
And so I've benefitted
from it.
And so, you know,
that what's what I wanna do,
is help other people.
You know, there's millions
of people out there
that can benefit from it.
Marvin,
I like it, actually.
I've herniated two disks
in my back from sports,
and so I know exactly what
you're saying.
And--and believe it or not,
I do do my own laundry.
You know,
I've had to deal with it,
but it's just not an area
where I have connections.
Just to say,
you know what?
"This is a great product.
Place this product for Marvin,
and--And go sell it for us."
Mm-hmm.
So for that reason, I'm out.
So, Marvin,
here's the good news.
I gotta tell ya,
I think it's a clever product.
Here's the bad news--
You've got a long way to go.
I think you just gotta go out
and sell some.
It's Sunday, baby.
You gotta go play the game.
You gotta go out
and knock on doors
and ask for an order--
Not a rep firm,
not some guy for you.
But I think you can do it.
I don't think you need
the money.
You just need the effort.
I'm out.
Okay.
Appreciate it.
Marvin...
my heart is in,
and I love you,
but my gut tells me
you're, like, halfway there.
You have issues,
things that I've brought up
that you need to work on.
Mm-hmm.
And so I'm out
with my money,
but because my heart is in,
you can give me a call...
sure.
When you're ready...
okay.
And I'll be there
to help you.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
I'm out, though.
Okay.
I was waiting to hear
what miss QVC was going to say,
because to me, this is
a very visual, tactile,
demonstratable product
on television.
I would think she'd jump
all over it and in it, frankly.
(laughs)
But it doesn't sound like
she's there,
and I'm a little surprised.
I don't think it's investable,
Marvin. Not right now.
And it certainly isn't worth
$700,000.
I'm just a disciplined investor
trying to go to bed
richer than I woke up, so--
aren't we all? (chuckles)
Well, I think that's what
makes America great.
Yeah.
But I'm out.
Thank you.
Marvin, you come in here,
and you're
a very, very nice guy.
I think
we're all rooting for you.
You know, you're an athlete
who learned the business
in six months.
But on the other side,
I mean,
you're really a shark
because you're offering us 12%
of a company that really doesn't
have much at this moment.
And, you know,
nice guys finish last.
I'm out.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
(Mark) Good luck, Marvin.
(Lori) Good luck. Keep thinking.
Thank you.
(Robert) Hey, Marvin,
that's not true.
Nice guys finish first
all the time.
There you go. (laughs)
There you go.
Me not getting a deal today
will--
Will make me work
that much Harder
to get this product out there
and--and take
the necessary steps to, uh,
to make it a household name.
