My name is Henry penix,
and I'm the C.E.O. of Zomm.
I'm asking for $2 million...
Whoa.
Whoa.
For 10% of my entire company.
But let me ask. You--
(Robert) But, Henry, you--
You've raised $9 million,
how do you burn through
$9 million in...
two years?
Can you explain that to me?
Okay, Henry, I'm the last shark
still looking at this.
