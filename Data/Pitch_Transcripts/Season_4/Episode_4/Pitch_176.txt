My name is Henry penix,
and I'm the C.E.O. of Zomm.
I'm asking for $2 million...
Whoa.
Whoa.
For 10% of my entire company.
At Zomm, we create products
and services
that revolutionize what people
do with their cell phones.
And everyone has
a cell phone.
Have any of you all ever left
your phones behind somewhere
at a restaurant or bar or maybe
at home in the morning?
I have, too.
Well, when you put this
to your keychain
and it separates
from your phone,
it's gonna warn you that
you've walked away
and left your phone behind.
Let me show you how it works.
Mark, you mind holding this?
Sure.
Okay. All right, so say
you've--say you went home
and you're rushing out
to the office, grab your keys
'cause you gotta have your keys
to drive your car.
When you get about
20 or 30 feet away,
let me show you what happens.
I'm gonna step over here.
You should feel a vibration.
Yep. Sure do.
Yeah.
And it'll light up.
You can see it light up.
Sure does.
So if those two don't
get your attention,
an alarm will start.
(beeping gradually
increases volume)
And then it'll start getting
louder and louder
until you turn around...
until I come get my phone.
And get your phone. Yeah. Yeah.
So you can press the middle
button to turn it off.
(beeping stops)
Everything's one-Button press.
Very simple.
Very cool.
Uh-huh. Thank you.
The second thing that it does--
you can find your keys with it.
Let me do this.
(beep)
Uh, Daymond, do you mind
to hang onto this?
When I turn around,
pass it to somebody,
and then I'll figure out
who took it.
You got it?
(pinging sound)
I could tell by your eyes!
(laughs)
(speaks indistinctly)
(Lori) Sounds like a submarine.
(laughs)
The depth of the undertaker.
(pinging stops)
So, um, the next thing
that it does--
It's actually
an emergency dialer.
You can program any number
in it.
I've put my wife's number
in it.
(phone rings)
(woman)
Hey, are you in trouble?
I may be. I'm swimming
with sharks right now.
All right,
talk to you later.
So this is
the modern-day version
of "I've fallen
and I can't get up!"
Well, yeah. Yeah, it has
that aspect to it as well.
We've had a lot of people
buy it for that.
Well, I've seen this
in similar ways before.
I've seen a dog collar
Where if your pet goes too far,
your phone rings.
Is it
all the elements combined
that makes this so special
or worth $20 million? Or...
it is. Yeah, we've got patents
all over the world,
uh, won innovation awards
the last three years.
So tell us about your sales,
your costs, your margins,
what it's being sold for,
et cetera.
When we first came out with it
in late 2010,
we did about $750,000
in sales.
What were your sales in 2011?
We did right at $5 million.
But let me ask. You--
(Robert) But, Henry, you--
You've raised $9 million,
how do you burn through
$9 million in...
two years?
Can you explain that to me?
Okay, Henry, I'm the last shark
still looking at this.
What intrigues me are sales,
and you have them.
But... I don't think I'm gonna
give you $2 million.
All I care about is when
I part with my money
and send it off to summer camp
to go and train
and learn a new skill, is that
it comes back in September
with a lot more muscles.
I'm scared
you'll kill my money.
I won't kill your money.
You've killed a lot of money
before mine.
Take--Take the majority
of the board seats.
I don't want to take control.
I really don't.
Let's--Let's figure it out.
Although--although you could
use me, believe me.
I could fix you in--in
darwinian ways you don't know,
but you may not find that
a pleasant experience.
I'm out.
Good luck.
Okay. All right,
thank you very much.
Bye-Bye.
(Mark) He just went big.
If he were to come
into the Shark Tank
the day he started and said,
"Guys, I need help. I want
$250,000 for 25% of my company,"
We'd have been all over it.
(Robert)
You know, it's a shame there.
(Lori) It's a great product.
That was a great product.
