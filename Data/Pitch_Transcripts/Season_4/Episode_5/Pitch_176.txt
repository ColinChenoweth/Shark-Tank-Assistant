First in is Aly Lessor,
with a business inspired
by her daughter Cosette.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Aly Lessor,
Okay, Aly, here--Here's
the way I see it.
The biggest mistake many,
many entrepreneurs make
is that they try to do
too much too soon.
Aly has three offers
on the table.
Kevin's offer--
$50,000 for zero equity,
but a royalty
for every dress sold.
I don't want to do it, aly...
Lori, listen--
I'm gonna tell you something
right now. Lori, listen.
But I'm going to pull out
a check...
Lori--Lori, listen. Lori--
Aly, I'm talking to you.
Aly--Aly--
There's many deals I did...
having said--
Just last year
on "Shark Tank,"
This is what they do--
Aly, tell them to stop.
Do you have any other
questions?
Aly, this is what they do
when they're threatened.
Aly, what are you
going to do?
Well...
Who do you want
as a partner?
Right this way.
That's really the bottom line.
Who do you want as a partner?
Aly, what are you
going to do?
Who do you feel will be
the best partner?
I am going to...
(clicks tongue) Oh, man.
If you're not sure
of who to go with,
I may take away my offer,
because I feel you should know
what's the right offer.
(clicks tongue)
Okay, Daymond,
we have a deal.
Good decision.
(Mark) congratulations.
Okay, thank you.
All right.
(Robert) boy, I did--
Give me a hug.
I did not see that one
coming.
I gotta know why. Why?
I just didn't like
the "take away"...
what do you mean?
That Lori offered me.
She's like, "I'm gonna
take my deal away,"
