First in is Aly Lessor,
with a business inspired
by her daughter Cosette.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Aly Lessor,
and I'm the creator
of the children's clothing line
Cozy Bug.
I'm asking for $50,000
in exchange for
25% of my company.
Most kids outgrow their clothes
every season,
and it gets really expensive.
However, our pillowcase dresses
grow with the kids.
And the way
they're designed,
they cinch here
at the neck,
and then we use
these beautiful ribbons
that tie at the shoulder,
allowing for growth
under the arm
and in length.
Now eventually,
the kids sprout so much,
and then you just put on
an adorable pair
of leggings or shorts
and you have another outfit
for years to come.
Cosette is 4 years old,
and she's in
a size 4.
This is Morgan,
who's 8 years old,
and she is still
in a size 4.
I'm a Southern girl
now living in Los Angeles,
and my mother-In-law
in Alabama
started mailing us
the most adorable
monogrammed pillowcase
dresses
for my daughter Cosette.
Cosette is Cozy Bug.
That's her nickname.
And whenever she wore them,
we would literally get stopped
four to five times a day
by moms saying,
"Where did you get
that outfit?"
and that's when I decided
to pillowcase the world.
Our pillowcase dresses are not
actually made from pillowcases.
We use really fun,
vibrant fabrics.
We have jackets, jeggings,
shirts,
and of course every outfit
needs a matching hair bow,
which we've sold
thousands of.
I have taken Cozy Bug
just about as far as I can
with my contacts.
With your help
and expertise,
we can make Cozy Bug
an international brand
and take it places
I could only imagine.
So come on, sharks.
Who's ready to pillowcase
the world?
Aw!
(sharks laugh)
Okay, thank you, girls.
Say bye to the sharks.
Bye, sharks!
(Lori) Bye!
(Mark) See ya!
(men) Bye!
Aw. (laughs)
I'm in.
(laughter)
(laughs)
Is the concept
of a pillowcase dress
something that's been around
in the south forever,
as you said?
It has, yes.
(Lori) Oh, really?
Yeah.
How many people
are in your company?
Me.
Just you?
Yeah.
(Robert)
What's your background?
I was in sales. I've been
in sales for 20 years.
And had my daughter Cosette.
And they were not letting me
pump my breast milk at work.
And I told my 26-year-old
female manager,
"I need to pump,"
and she's like,
"Oh, we don't have time
for that right now.
You're gonna have to wait."
So I told my manager,
"I'm sorry.
I have to go do this
right now."
And she's like, "you can get
your stuff and go home."
Fired me--
Oh, my--
Wow.
Really?
Yes. And, uh...
come on.
Yes, so I sued her, won,
and I had money
to start my company.
Wow, good for you.
I love that.
I love that.
Outstanding. Great story.
I can't believe somebody
would say that to you. That's--
I was like,
what year are we in?
A female, at that.
What does it cost you
to make one pillowcase dress?
$6.
$6.
With fabric
and manufacturing.
I know you guys could get
that done a lot cheaper.
(chuckles)
Where are you selling?
The main place we sell
is online.
In just 30 days,
we sold over $300,000...
Whoa. Oh.
Worth of dresses.
Oh. Really?
The Web site that I sell on--
Have you guys heard of
zulily?
So you're allowed
to go on there
three days every month.
And within 30 days
of being on there,
$300,000.
Ooh!
We also just launched
our own dancewear line
called Dance Bug.
We sell tutus and all that.
(Kevin) Why,
when you know you've found
this remarkable niche,
would you want to bother
competing
with everybody else
in the children's lines,
making, you know,
ballerina dresses and coats?
Kevin's right.
So you think just this?
You've got--You've got
the ability
to differentiate yourself
from everybody,
and it's making you
a boatload of money.
Why not be great
at one thing?
I don't agree with that,
because this is
a fashion item--
'cause it doesn't work
on QVC, that's why.
If mark knew about fashion,
he would know that women,
when you start with something
and it's a great concept
and people are loving it,
they want more.
And that's how businesses
continue to grow
and grow and grow.
So you are very smart to--
That's also how businesses
go out of business as well.
They try to get too wide--
All of these--
Nothing great.
Well, maybe,
But not in fashion, Mark.
In fashion--
Right, because so many fashion
companies just stay in business.
They all stay in business.
None of them ever go out
from expanding their lines
too quickly.
But, Mark, you're not
in the fashion business.
Okay, Aly, here--Here's
the way I see it.
The biggest mistake many,
many entrepreneurs make
is that they try to do
too much too soon.
And it kills them
and they go out of business.
I like to shoot for the stars.
I see me going everywhere.
I'm glad you told me that,
because to me,
it's better to dominate
at one thing
and then build off of that.
By going too wide,
typically companies drown.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm not here
just for money.
I'm here for a partnership.
I have tried countless times
to even get phone numbers
or contacts of the buyers
at the big box stores.
It's impossible.
It's a secret society.
All right, let me--
Let me clear
the field a little bit.
I can't really offer you
the expertise
in terms of what you're doing
and your expansion plans.
Let me get out of the way.
I'm out.
I wish you all the best.
And I'll make you
an offer, okay?
Because you're unique.
I'll give you $50,000,
and here's how much equity
I want in your business.
Zero. Okay?
You're gonna pay me
$2 a dress
until I get my 50k back,
and then you're gonna pay me
$1 forever after that.
Here's the covenant.
I forbid you to make anything
except hair bows
and pillowcase dresses.
Every dress does need
a hair bow. (laughs)
(laughter)
It's true.
Last season,
I took a woman
who came in with a towel
with a slit in it.
Mr. Wonderful said
It was insane.
It was madness.
And to date, we're
in the Disney theme parks,
all over, with that towel
with the slit in it.
I'm going to offer you
the $50,000...
Take 30% stake in the company,
and take this nationwide.
And not just on QVC,
but we can take it
into all the retailers,
and I think that I can
make you a millionaire
with this line.
Here's why that's
a bad idea.
If you go the route
that Lori's suggesting,
you don't make enough money
to sell to retailers--
Excuse me.
Silence.
You're the silent partner.
Here's what's--
Here's what's good about
what I'm doing for you.
I am forcing you into
a tunnel of profitability,
where every time you get up
in the morning and make a sale,
you make money.
That's a grand plan,
kind of like the "titanic."
And that is the only plan.
(Daymond)
Let me just, uh...
don't even get involved.
I'm just gonna take
the deal. Um...
(laughs)
This is my area.
I know I can make you
the millionaire quicker.
I'm gonna offer you
the $50,000 for 30%--
The same thing as Lori's.
And your avenue would be to
get it in the retail stores?
That's the only value
that I would bring to it,
is to roll it out to retail,
to roll it out quick,
to roll it out globally,
and bring you into my system
and distribute it.
(Lori) And I can do
all of the above...
(Kevin) Aly, these--
Just the same and more.
(Kevin speaks Indistinctly)
Wait a minute, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.
I have to clarify one thing,
because if you go with her,
right after she sells
hemorrhoid cream,
she'll sell your stuff and then
dental cream or something else.
We are not all--
Who knows what he's
even talking about?
We are not all--listen.
I know how to do
what you want to be done.
Daymond, I just passed
a lemonade stand this morning
that sells more product
than you.
Whoa! (laughs)
Ow.
I know.
I did $6 billion.
B-B-B-Billion.
I did $500 million
with walmart This year.
You're selling dresses
for little girls.
Who do you think
is a better partner
to make clothing
for little girls?
(Daymond) I have
two daughters.
I did $1 billion
in kids' clothing alone.
Would you guys,
Lori and Daymond,
ever want to do
a sweetheart deal,
where we all work together?
No.
I don't want it on QVC.
Okay. Okay.
I do not want it on QVC...
okay.
And I don't think you should
have it on QVC.
Okay.
You gotta start making
some decisions.
So what are you gonna do?
Aly has three offers
on the table.
Kevin's offer--
$50,000 for zero equity,
but a royalty
for every dress sold.
And competing offers
from Lori and Daymond,
each offering $50,000
for 30% equity.
All roads lead to Mr. Wonderful.
(laughs)
(mark laughs)
One question for Lori.
Um, so you plan to do QVC
and you have
access to retailers?
I have ins
to all the retailers,
all across America.
And, Daymond, you just have
the contacts everywhere.
I know you do.
I have a full global
distribution center.
I have 15 designers
that work for me.
Okay. And you don't see it
at all being a problem
to get in Macy's or Penney's
or wherever you see?
I don't see it being a problem.
And I'm already doing
heavy volume
and heavy business
with all of them.
I don't want to do it, aly...
Lori, listen--
I'm gonna tell you something
right now. Lori, listen.
But I'm going to pull out
a check...
Lori--Lori, listen. Lori--
And write you a check
right now.
If she writes you a check,
I'm not gonna match it.
You know what?
I believe in you so much...
Lori, how many brands
have you made? Not products.
That I just wrote a check
on the spot.
How many brands
have you grown?
(Mark) Aly--Aly--
I'm not listening to him.
Lori, how many brands
have you grown?
Aly, I'm talking to you.
Name the brand
that you have grown.
I'm not gonna sit here
and name--
Aly--Aly--
There's many deals I did...
having said--
Just last year
on "Shark Tank,"
okay? And it's not--
Okay, guys, guys, that's--
That's enough.
This is what they do--
Aly, tell them to stop.
Do you have any other
questions?
Aly, this is what they do
when they're threatened.
Aly, what are you
going to do?
Well...
Who do you want
as a partner?
Right this way.
That's really the bottom line.
Who do you want as a partner?
Aly, what are you
going to do?
Who do you feel will be
the best partner?
I am going to...
(clicks tongue) Oh, man.
If you're not sure
of who to go with,
I may take away my offer,
because I feel you should know
what's the right offer.
(clicks tongue)
Okay, Daymond,
we have a deal.
Good decision.
(Mark) congratulations.
Okay, thank you.
All right.
(Robert) boy, I did--
Give me a hug.
I did not see that one
coming.
I gotta know why. Why?
I just didn't like
the "take away"...
what do you mean?
That Lori offered me.
She's like, "I'm gonna
take my deal away,"
and I was like,
"Ohh! Daymond!"
good decision.
Congratulations.
Thank you, guys.
I really wanted Lori
and Daymond,
and it was very chaotic,
very hectic.
In my brain, I was like,
"Oh, my god, what do I do?"
but I'm so excited
I chose Daymond,
and now we're gonna
pillowcase the world.
Every time Lori tries
to make a deal,
you guys dump on her
for the QVC.
You see when it's a tech play,
I go to you three guys.
We can handle it.
You see when it's a QVC play,
I ask about Lori.
When she gets in my space...
I hear you--
Come on!
You just do that
because you're threatened.
But when did Lori say she was
gonna put her on QVC?
At the beginning.
She always says it!
Listen, both of you,
suck it up.
Be a shark
and stop your whining.
It's ridiculous.
(laughter)
It's ridiculous.
Oh...
On season 2, brothers
David and Stu Pikoff
Turned down an offer
from Kevin O'Leary
for 51% of games2u,
which brings
games and entertainment
to children's parties
and events.
A controlling position
in our company
is not something we're
able or willing to do.
Let's see what they're
up to now.
