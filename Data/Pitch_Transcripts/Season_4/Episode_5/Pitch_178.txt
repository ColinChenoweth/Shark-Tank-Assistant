Hello. My name
is Brandon Marz,
this is my dad Keith,
and our company
is Marz Sprays.
We're seeking $200,000
for a 10% equity interest
in our company.
We're here today to talk
about something
that nobody likes to do,
and that's swallow pills.
We all like
the benefits we get
from vitamins
and supplements.
But did you know
that over 100 million people
in the United States Alone
cannot or have difficulty
swallowing pills?
What's worse,
they might not even work.
If you took a vitamin b
or a vitamin c pill
That may look like
it's the size of Pittsburgh,
you may only absorb
10% or 20% of it.
As a father of two boys
who refused to swallow
any pills,
I knew something
had to be done.
So we developed
Marz Sprays--
a full line of oral sprays
for health and wellness.
C-Spray is our multivitamin
immunity blend,
which has as much
Vitamin c
as 114 oranges.
Kids spray has
the real nutrients
from all these real
fruits and vegetables.
Slim spray was developed
with the assistance
of doctors and phds
to help reduce
food cravings.
Reboot is our energy spray,
which has a megadose
of vitamin b-12.
If you bought 1 energy shot
each day for 30 days,
you'd spend over $100.
Reboot retails for $14.99,
and lasts an entire month.
Sleep spray has three well-Known
sleep aid ingredients--
Gaba, melatonin,
and valerian root.
I'll try the reboot.
I want the reboot, too.
Hit me.
No problem.
And can I look at the c-Spray?
Sure.
Give her the sleep spray.
(laughs)
(Mark) Please.
Thank you, Brandon.
My pleasure.
Spray it
in your mouth.
(spritzes)
Wow. That's really strong.
Whoo! (coughs) Oh!
Reboot.
Reboot for you?
Lot of energy takers
in the crowd.
(spritzing)
It's got an awful taste.
Chocolate?
It's chocolate.
Yeah.
It's chocolate. That's 'cause
you don't like sweets.
We also have created
and paid for and developed
five infomercials.
In fact,
I could show you one.
I have it on my phone.
Since I have
a t-Mobile phone,
I can just share it
on that tv.
Vitamin c.
(laughs) You know it's good
for supporting
your immune system.
If you've taken
vitamin C pills or powders
for any of these benefits,
then get ready,
because the next evolution
of vitamin c is here,
and it's as simple
as spray... Spray.
C-Spray daily
immune system support.
Hmm.
Not bad.
Very good.
It's Nicely done.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So why do you feel
that this is a solution
to the people
that have to take pills?
For the 100
to 150 million people
that can't swallow pills...
and where did you get
this data from?
'cause you're saying
almost half of America...
40%.
Will not take pills.
That was a study done
by a company called
Harris interactive.
But you realize how stupid
it all sounds, right?
You're saying that everybody
who delivers anything via pill
is so stupid
they can't figure out
that there's this big market...
Oh, no, no, no.
For alternative
deliveries.
They're not stupid.
They have a market share
that's fine with them.
There's lots of companies
offering homeopathic
alternatives using sprays.
There's
no major market Leader.
We're poised
to be that Leader.
So you're saying...
Well, Wait, wait, wait.
What about vitamins?
There's so many--
Wait, wait, wait.
You're saying
there's so many competitors,
that none of them
has really taken the lead,
and you wanna compete
with all of them?
No. We're saying--
But wait, Mark...
Mark, I think you took
a different spray than I did.
You seem very irritable
about this.
It's a scam!
I mean, it's a hustle, right?
I mean, it's a hustle.
Wait a second.
The whole supplement market's
a hustle.
Exactly.
Hey, Yeah, Keith,
he just called you a hustler.
Now hold it, Keith.
I know, and I was
offended by that,
because--
Guys. Guys.
Your answer is simple--
The supplement market is
a multibillion-dollar market.
So why don't you
just say that?
Do I have to say that for you?
What's the matter with you guys?
Brandon, holy crap!
What did you give us
in this?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let's all stop.
Lots of b-12.
It's very good for you.
Trust me.
They're feeling like
chum in the water.
It works.
To answer your question,
we're not hustlers.
We have first mover advantage.
But, Brandon,
prove us wrong.
Do you have any sales?
Yes.
So originally, we only
had one product,
which was
the slim spray product,
and we sold that
in some small retail locations
and to one distributor.
Give me a number!
You need to hear
the story.
I'm jacked up on b-12! Hit me.
He's--he's--he's gonna
give you an answer.
In about nine months,
we did about $125,000
of sales.
What are your total sales,
all products?
Keep in mind these products,
as you see them
packaged here today,
entered into
our fulfillment center
nine business days ago.
We attended and exhibited
at the largest
vitamin supplement conference
in the world.
The response
was absolutely overwhelming.
One of the first people
that asked for an appointment
was one of the biggest pill
companies in the United States.
What company?
Nature's--Nature's made.
Nature's made.
Now that's interesting.
So they're interested?
We're negotiating a licensing
agreement with them right now.
They want--
and--and that's the answer
to mark's question.
They want to do
a licensing agreement.
Now why is that?
Because they have
144 different S.K.U.S
so they don't need
to be in our business.
But, Keith, hang on a sec.
I know you didn't invent
the ability to spray...
absolutely not.
Right.
So what do they want
from you?
They specifically came
to us and said,
"we don't have the capacity
to make an oral spray.
You've done a great job doing
it. We want to license it."
We also have
five pending purchase Orders
for over a million dollars.
Whoa.
Why are they pending?
What's the pending?
The reason they're pending--and
that's a very valid question.
It's a good question.
We went to
an international conference
where buyers came
from all over the world.
The only reason
it's pending...
it's europe.
They have to clear it.
Is because we haven't
registered our product...
they have to clear it.
Yes.
In their
respective countries.
We've hired a consultant
out of France
that's right now
registering our products
in the seven countries that we
have interest from originally.
You know, registering
each one of those countries
takes a long period
of time.
It's like every version
of the F.D.A.,
and it make take
six months, a year.
There's gonna be
a lot of challenges
with claims, labels,
international shipping.
A lot
of those other countries
are way more stringent
than we are.
We've been quoted 60 to 90 days
for the full registration
process.
I know it'll take longer because
I've--I've dealt in this.
I'm out.
I-I will tell you this--
The reboot stuff
really works.
I'm hyper enough.
Look at him.
Um, I'm not
a big supplement guy.
I never gave external
vitamins to my kids.
I think there's way too much
of that going on in society.
I find the whole thing
hard to swallow.
I'm out.
I'm not a big believer
that you have anything
that's protectable.
I think you've vastly
underestimated
How much money
it's gonna take
to become "the brand."
I don't think
it has to be protected
for us to be the Leader
in this industry.
I'm out.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Lori, together, we can
make a lot of money.
Well, here's the thing.
I like what you're doing,
so I'm gonna
make you an offer.
Kevin and Lori are
Brandon and Keith's last chance
to make a deal.
Well, here's the thing.
I like what you're doing.
I'm into
the vitamin industry.
I like
the homeopathic industry.
I believe in both.
And I like the fact
that this is an oral spray.
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.
I'm gonna offer you $200,000,
but I want 30% of the company
contingent upon you getting
the nature's made deal.
Thank you very much
for the offer.
I think there's one more,
just in fairness,
that we're waiting for,
and that's you,
Mr. Wonderful.
Hmm. Interesting.
I also like this space
because of its size.
I like what Lori
brings to the table,
and we don't--We don't
participate together very often,
but I love
her leverage on tv.
Why does she need you?
But--Wait.
Silence, please.
I say we give 'em
$250,000 for 40%.
I'd rather do it alone.
Well, because I threw her
an Olive leaf,
and she stepped on it...
she did.
I am forced to do this--
I will give you
the $200,000 for 25%.
Do not screw
with Mr. Wonderful.
Guys, two deals on the table.
Mr. Wonderful--
$200,000 for 25%.
Lori--$200,000 for 30%.
I've never seen a man sweat
as much in my life.
(laughter)
I will match Kevin's deal.
Wow!
Is this not a moment
where you thank Mr. Wonderful?
Without his bid...
the undertaker.
You would have had somebody
take an extra 5%.
You should give that to me
for free.
Lori, can I ask you a question?
I'm in this for the equity.
Would you give me
a redemption option
to buy back half the stock
at three times your investment?
You keep half.
That way we both can get
very rich together.
You believe in it so much?
Then buy it back at four times.
Kevin, did you hear
our proposal to Lori?
I never participate
in options
where I am not getting
any upside.
This is an equity deal.
We're partners together.
It's unfair
for one partner to say,
"listen, after all
the risks have been taken,
"and things are on fire,
and it's working,
I call back my equity."
But remember--
The original deal was for 10%.
So the difference was something
that you threw out there.
You're gonna lose
both deals in a second.
Lori, we came here wanting
to be partners with you.
There's no question
you are gonna bring
this product to America.
One last shot--Will you
consider 20%,
same deal,
and we have a deal?
We buy back half,
20%, $200,000.
What--
No.
Okay. 25% is your deal?
You got a deal, Lori.
Great.
Whoo!
All right.
This is gonna be great.
We're very excited
to be partners.
I gotta tell you,
I did not see that
ending up the way it did.
Congratulations.
Thanks so much.
You got hustled, Lori.
(laughs) I did not get hustled.
The buyback...
is bad.
The buyback was ridiculous.
No. She didn't agree
to the buyback.
Yes, she did.
You agreed
to the buyback?
Four times. Four times.
Lori, he out-sharked you
on that one.
That's his company--
No, he didn't.
That's his company,
and he has the right to have
the major stake in it.
After you've taken
all the risk?
It--It--
Help make us popular,
and then get out of here?
You guys, this is the decision
that I made.
I made it for my reasons,
and I think
it was the right decision.
You cost us a fortune.
I did what
I thought was right,
and--And I feel good about it.
Whew!
