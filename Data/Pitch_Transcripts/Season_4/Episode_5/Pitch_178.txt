Hi. My name's Roger Sullivan.
My company is Wired Waffles.
I'm here seeking $75,000
for a 25% stake
in the company.
Basically, we've taken
an energy drink
and we've put it
into a waffle.
Think about it--People
walk into a convenience store,
and they grab an energy drink
or a shot for their energy,
But they still need a snack
to satisfy their hunger.
The wired waffle does both.
With our proprietary
energy blend,
we've been able to create
something that's delicious,
functional, and designed for
today's most active lifestyles.
And I've brought some samples
for you guys to try.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
There you go.
Roger, do you put anything
on it to make it taste better?
Thank you.
Um, you can,
But the--they were designed
with the flavor already
inside of them.
They taste really dry.
Is that part of the flavor?
Yeah. It's, um...
they were designed to be
more like a scone texture,
so something that, uh, is--
is kind of complementary to--
What is the shelf life
of this?
It lasts for 30 days
on the shelf.
This has guarana in it,
or no?
No, it does not. It has
natural caffeine extract.
How much caffeine is in this?
Is this like drinking
five cups of coffee?
It's about a 20-ounce
premium cup of coffee.
Venti.
So it's really like four
or five cups of coffee?
I mean, regular cups--
It's about three.
It's about three.
Like, really?
So, if I--
if I ate two of these,
what would happen?
You'd just be--
You'd just be excited.
Basically what I did is
I looked at--I looked at--
Just be excited.
It would take many more than
that to get him excited.
How long have you been
selling these?
Where have you been
selling these?
Give us some background.
Okay, Well, um,
we first brought
the product to market
back in October, um, for...
we did a-a test run
of about 10,000 units.
Based on the feedback
that we got during that time,
we went back
to the drawing board,
we changed the recipe,
and then
we've officially launched
This particular product
less than a month ago.
What are sales, then?
Can you give us
any indication
in the first month
what you sold?
Um, the first month,
right now,
we're at about--
We're at about $1,000.
Oh, really?
$1,000.
I just got--
I got, um...
you of course realize
that is absolutely nothing?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Give him a chance.
He just got started.
Yeah, absolutely.
So $1,000--He's Only
sold it for a month.
But on Friday, I got a phone
call from one of our brokers,
and he's telling me that
he's putting together an order
that's 22 pallets. It could be
a $140,000 order.
(Kevin) Who's buying that?
A distributor
in Dallas, Texas.
And have they
ever tried it before?
Actually, they have
sampled the product.
They actually move
another waffle product
in convenience stores,
and they're thinking
they can put ours
right alongside of it,
and that it'll take off.
Roger, let's assume
it takes off.
What stops any
confectionary operator
that has massive distribution
from absolutely killing you
by doing this themselves?
There's nothing
proprietary about this.
No, there--There--
There's not.
But, you know,
the thing is,
is we've--We've taken
and we've energized
one of the most
recognizable comfort foods
on the face of the planet.
People love waffles.
So if someone's
gonna come along,
they're either
gonna have to just be
a blatant,
outright copy, or--
Yeah? So?
You have to admit,
you have an idea.
If this concept takes hold
and gets traction,
you are the pioneer that'll get
the arrows in his back,
because any large
confectionary operator
with, you know,
industrial kitchens
will slaughter you
like the cockroach you are.
You know what? You say--
How do you stop that
from happening?
You say that to...
you know, seriously,
I am so...
You know why? It's true.
I am so sick of that...
Yay, Robert.
Tell it like it is.
Line from you.
You know what?
You say that to everybody.
Every--"you're not unique.
You don't have a patent."
I want to know the answer.
Are you telling me everything
you've ever invested in,
it was the only one out there?
I want a proprietary
fence around it,
so it has a chance!
You're such an idiot!
You want--Kevin, you know why
you want a proprietary fence?
Why not?
Because you don't know how
to run a company,
you don't know how
to preempt the competition...
sure I do.
You don't know how to compete,
you don't know how to sell.
You don't know
how to create profit.
Did all that already.
You want--You want
it all handed to you.
No.
That's just wrong.
I want to make
smart investments,
not stupid ones, Mark.
I'm thinking about
giving you the money
because it gave us
the energy to argue.
(laughter)
How do you stop children
from buying these?
No kidding.
Because they would just be,
like, crazed, wouldn't they?
There's a warning
on the label, you know,
that says that it's
not intended for kids.
It's not intended for,
you know, pregnant mothers.
We're targeting
the same market
that's going after
the energy drinks.
Now I'd like to
stand here and say,
you know, that
we're--We're going after
the 18-
to 35-year-old market.
But the fact is, is that
kids drink energy drinks.
You know, my kids
Drink energy drinks.
The neighbor kids
drink energy drinks.
But, you know,
that's where Lori's right--
Someone's gonna
crush you,
crush you
on the selling it to kids.
I do think it's a bit
of a liability nightmare.
That's a lot of caffeine,
and it's a sweet.
So kids are gonna
get their hands on it,
and I think
that's very problematic.
For that reason,
I'm out.
I don't really know people
that eat cold waffles.
Is that something that...
the product
was designed originally to--
It's best heated up.
But because we're going after
the convenience store market,
where we're displaying,
where point of sale is,
stuff is right on the counter,
it's by the coffee stuff,
it's by the microwave.
But you don't
say that on here.
You don't recommend
it be heated up.
I don't get the product.
I think
that the whole purpose
energy shots are working
is it's quick.
You take it, you're gone.
This is becoming a process
of making a meal almost.
Um, so I wish you luck,
but I'm out.
Look, Roger,
I like the idea
you created
a new category...
Mm-hmm.
For caffeine
energy products.
I just--I just don't see
a waffle as the one
that's gonna open
a market share.
And for $75,000,
I don't wanna bet
on waffles.
I'm out.
We've got, you know,
I-I-I don't know what else
to say. You know--
Roger, it's actually--
It's actually a good idea.
I can--I can envision it
being in convenience stores,
and to pick up,
and, you know,
I can see somebody
saying, "Oh," you know,
"peanut butter
and chocolate," you know?
Energy drinks and waffles.
But I don't see you
selling a lot of them.
And--
Here's--Here's
the deal, mark--
is basically, I've created
the energy blend
that I can put into anything.
I put it into a waffle
because we felt like
we were looking
for a breakfast snack,
a breakfast offering, okay?
I get it. I get that.
The bad news is, I-I-I just
didn't like the product.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
All right. Thanks.
Caffeine is the most
consumed drug in the world.
And that goes to my point.
You know,
here's the frustration--
If you had stood there
and said to me,
look, I've found a unique
and proprietary way
to infuse baked goods with
the most popular drug on earth,
and my plan is to go
to license it
to a thousand bakeries that make
food that people already eat,
and brands they already know,
that's a business
I would invest in.
It's a proprietary
energy blend that I've created
to be able
to put into anything.
Yes, but that's not
your business plan.
You want to actually
establish distribution
of a waffle that so far, not one
shark said they liked eating.
That's the cold,
hard truth about this.
It doesn't taste
that good.
I'm out.
Thanks, Kevin.
All right. Thanks, guys.
Good luck, Roger.
Thank you very much.
Good luck, Roger.
I appreciate your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Obviously, I'm disappointed.
But at the end of the day,
the success of our business
doesn't--doesn't rest
on the shoulders of five people.
