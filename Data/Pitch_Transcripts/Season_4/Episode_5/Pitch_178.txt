Hi. My name's Roger Sullivan.
My company is Wired Waffles.
I'm here seeking $75,000
for a 25% stake
in the company.
Basically, we've taken
an energy drink
Roger, do you put anything
on it to make it taste better?
Thank you.
Um, you can,
But the--they were designed
with the flavor already
inside of them.
They taste really dry.
Is that part of the flavor?
Yeah. It's, um...
they were designed to be
more like a scone texture,
so something that, uh, is--
is kind of complementary to--
What is the shelf life
of this?
It lasts for 30 days
on the shelf.
This has guarana in it,
or no?
No, it does not. It has
natural caffeine extract.
How much caffeine is in this?
Is this like drinking
five cups of coffee?
It's about a 20-ounce
premium cup of coffee.
Venti.
So it's really like four
or five cups of coffee?
I mean, regular cups--
It's about three.
It's about three.
Like, really?
So, if I--
if I ate two of these,
what would happen?
You'd just be--
You'd just be excited.
Basically what I did is
I looked at--I looked at--
Just be excited.
It would take many more than
that to get him excited.
How long have you been
selling these?
Where have you been
selling these?
Give us some background.
Okay, Well, um,
we first brought
the product to market
back in October, um, for...
we did a-a test run
of about 10,000 units.
Based on the feedback
that we got during that time,
we went back
to the drawing board,
we changed the recipe,
Roger, let's assume
it takes off.
What stops any
confectionary operator
that has massive distribution
from absolutely killing you
by doing this themselves?
There's nothing
proprietary about this.
No, there--There--
There's not.
But, you know,
the thing is,
Look, Roger,
I like the idea
you created
a new category...
Mm-hmm.
For caffeine
energy products.
I just--I just don't see
a waffle as the one
that's gonna open
a market share.
Roger, it's actually--
It's actually a good idea.
I can--I can envision it
being in convenience stores,
Good luck, Roger.
Thank you very much.
Good luck, Roger.
I appreciate your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Obviously, I'm disappointed.
But at the end of the day,
the success of our business
doesn't--doesn't rest
on the shoulders of five people.
