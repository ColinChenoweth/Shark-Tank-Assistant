My name's Cheryl Rigdon.
I live
in Easley, South Carolina,
Hello. My name is
Cheryl Rigdon,
Cheryl, who makes them?
Who physically makes them?
I do.
Right now,
they're just prototypes.
So that's why I'm asking
for the money,
so I can get
these manufactured.
Do you have a plan, Cheryl,
on how you're gonna sell these?
Well, first, I gotta
get 'em manufactured
(Robert) So, Cheryl,
you get the money,
you get them made...
What happens next?
How are you
gonna sell these?
I think QVC would be
a great way to go.
Cheryl, the problem
with that strategy
is it increases
the packaging costs...
Yeah.
For a consumer goods
company.
Okay.
I think the challenge
with this idea
Cheryl, Mark and Kevin
are partly right.
But you never know.
Spatty Daddy
could be brilliant,
or Spatty Daddy could be dead.
The difference is gonna be
in you
Cheryl, I have
no doubt about you.
Yeah.
I have some doubts about
Spatty Daddy as a business.
Okay.
I'm out.
Okay.
I don't have the finances
to make it go any further
than where it is now.
