My name's Cheryl Rigdon.
I live
in Easley, South Carolina,
with my husband Michael
and our two dogs,
Tyson and Sierra.
Tyson! Bring that Frisbee!
Come here!
Sie--No. Don't lay down.
Come here.
You could definitely say
I'm a small-town Southern girl.
I came up with
my product idea
when I was
putting on makeup
to go out with my husband
for dinner.
I was getting so frustrated
with all the makeup
I was wasting,
having to throw away
because I couldn't get
to the bottom of my bottle.
So I looked online
for a product to buy,
and there wasn't
anything there.
So I just decided
to make it myself.
My idea's really simple,
But everyone says
that the best ideas
are the simple ones.
I know I have a great idea
that everyone would want.
But I've never started
a business before,
so I really need
the sharks' help.
With one of the sharks
behind me,
we could have my product
in every home in America.
Hello. My name is
Cheryl Rigdon,
and I'm the creator
of the Spatty.
I am asking for $50,000
for 40% of my business.
The Spatty is
a money-saving tool
that is gonna be in the homes
of people around the world.
As you all know, everyone's
talking about the economy
and how to stretch a dollar.
Take this bottle of lotion
as an example.
You can see there's still
lots of product
left at the bottom.
But you try to get it out
and nothing comes out.
So you look around the house
for something to use.
You try a spoon.
It's not gonna
fit in there, obviously.
You know, you try
a spatula.
You know,
just the hole's too small.
Nothing's gonna
fit in there.
So you just have to throw
all that product in the trash.
Well, I have a product
that is gonna end
all the unnecessary waste.
So let me introduce y'all
to the revolutionary...
Spatty...
(laughs)
(laughs)
And Spatty Daddy.
Whoa.
(sharks laugh)
Spatty Daddy!
Kevin, you have your new name!
The Spatty Daddy.
(laughs)
the Spatty and Spatty Daddy
are simple,
versatile tools...
(laughter)
(laughs)
(laughs)
They're, um,
simple, versatile tools
that fit inside
small openings
and will pay for themselves
in the first week they are used.
The Spatty and Spatty Daddy
give the consumer...
(laughs)
the ability to get every last
drop of their products
and will save the consumer
a significant amount of money.
Spatty and Spatty Daddy
work on many items.
Your makeups,
your face creams,
your shampoos,
your conditioners.
They're simple
But brilliant tools.
I'm gonna let y'all
try out a Spatty
and a Spatty Daddy
on some products.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
All right. I'll take
the little Spatty,
and the little bottle.
I figured you'd be
the little Spatty.
No, no, I wanna test
the surgical precision.
Where's your accent from?
From Greenville,
South Carolina.
Oh, it's a great accent.
Thanks.
I love your accent.
I do. I love it, though.
I do, too.
Thank you.
So what you do,
you just put it in,
and you just, um,
move it along the sides.
Um, and you can see
how much comes off.
Um, there's actually
a study done
by "Consumer Reports"
that shows you throw away
17% to 25% of the product.
Um, let's say this is
a $60 bottle of makeup,
that's $15.
Cheryl, who makes them?
Who physically makes them?
I do.
Right now,
they're just prototypes.
So that's why I'm asking
for the money,
so I can get
these manufactured.
Do you have a plan, Cheryl,
on how you're gonna sell these?
Well, first, I gotta
get 'em manufactured
and get 'em packaged.
Let's assume we've got
all that solved.
I have to...
Oh, you're--You're not
selling any at all today?
I put a couple on ebay,
just to see
how they would sell,
and get unbiased
opinions on 'em.
And kind of see
what price range
people would pay for it.
And what happened?
I had about 15
that sold off ebay.
Everybody really liked 'em.
They said,
"This is a great product.
It works perfectly."
And what price did you
sell it to them for?
Um, $2.99 for the Spatty,
$3.99 for the Spatty Daddy.
How much is it gonna cost you
before you can
start selling them?
I called a place in Florida,
and they said it would cost
a little over $9,000
for the molds
for the Spatty Daddy,
a little over $7,000
for the molds for the Spatty.
Is there any way,
do you think,
that you can test the market?
'cause 15 people
on ebay...
is not a lot. Yeah.
No, it's not.
This stuff is sheer gold.
Yes.
So if you can actually get
17% more out of a...
of makeup...
But will you still get
17% more out?
Or will you just--Because
it doesn't get everything.
You're still
gonna have--
It does if you keep--Look.
It does if you keep going.
I mean, if you really cared
about whatever this is,
you could get 90% of
what's in here with the Spatty.
I get it.
I think some people
would use it.
(Lori) Some people would.
(Robert) So, Cheryl,
you get the money,
you get them made...
What happens next?
How are you
gonna sell these?
I think QVC would be
a great way to go.
Um, I think
that Mary Kay and Avon,
they have a lot of people
out in the fields
around the world
who sell their makeup.
And they have to
test it out on people.
Cheryl, the problem
with that strategy
is it increases
the packaging costs...
Yeah.
For a consumer goods
company.
Okay.
I think the challenge
with this idea
is how do you get it
into the hands
of all the consumers
that can make use of it?
There's a cost
to doing that.
Yeah.
That is where the risk
in this deal is.
You've got a really
interesting product
and a great idea,
but what you haven't
brought me is the plan
on how you're gonna get it
into 100 million households.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, yeah, Kevin is
somewhat right.
I mean, he's never
all the way right.
He's always right.
In that it's a product,
it's not a company yet.
And you know that, right?
And that's why you're here
looking for help.
Yeah.
The challenge is formulating
an entire company.
And all the time and resources
required to do that.
And I just don't have
that time.
Um, so for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Cheryl, Mark and Kevin
are partly right.
But you never know.
Spatty Daddy
could be brilliant,
or Spatty Daddy could be dead.
The difference is gonna be
in you
and how you take it
to the market.
I'm a very, um,
goal-Oriented, um, person.
I don't even like
downtime.
I'm really bad.
It drives my husband crazy,
but I can't just
go home and sit.
I have to be doing something.
Cheryl, I have
no doubt about you.
Yeah.
I have some doubts about
Spatty Daddy as a business.
Okay.
I'm out.
Okay.
I don't have the finances
to make it go any further
than where it is now.
And that's where
I really need y'all
to help me out with that.
And I promise y'all
that I will work
night and day
on this if need be.
I think we're all
in love with you,
but it's just
a little too early for us.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I think, you know, this product
would sell tremendously
on QVC.
Well, you know,
I love you,
and I love your drive
and your determination.
And I love that you thought
and created something.
You had a problem,
you came up with the solution.
But I think it's too inexpensive
of a price point for QVC,
because people already have
to pay $5, $6...
for shipping and handling.
Shipping and handling.
And, uh, I see it as something
that could be
a promotional item,
that you could present
to avon or other places
how would
you contact them?
Like, if I just call them up,
would they talk to me?
Or would they say,
you know...
well, I would find
somebody in your area
that's an avon distributor,
and talk to them,
and say, "who's the head
of this region?"
I think you'll go far
because of you,
and because of your drive.
I'm sorry. For me,
I don't think it's the right
product right now.
I do think
it's more promotional.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Good luck.
So thank y'all
for y'all's time.
Good luck. You know
what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna give you
the number
to two of
the big makeup people...
Oh, that'd be great.
And I'll let you
contact them, okay?
Thank you.
That'd be awesome.
Thank you so much.
No problem. Good luck.
All right. Thank you.
All right. Bye.
Thank y'all.
Bye.
The sharks gave me
some great advice in the tank,
and I hope they smile
when they see the Spatty
and the Spatty Daddy
on the shelf.
