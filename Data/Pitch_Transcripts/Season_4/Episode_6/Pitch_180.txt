and NFL running back
Brandon Jacobs.
Hi. My name is
Tania Patruno...
and I'm 2-Time super Bowl
champion Brandon Jacobs.
And my company is PRO-NRG.
I'm here seeking $250,000
in exchange for 15% equity.
PRO-NRG is a unique
protein-Infused flavored water.
It's all-Natural
and great-Tasting,
with no fat, no caffeine,
and no sugar.
In just one 4-Ounce bottle,
there are 15 Grams
of whey protein,
essential vitamins,
and an energy blend.
It's balanced no matter
how active your lives are.
I didn't get to where I am
by playing a half a game.
I got to where I am
by playing a whole game
at a very, very high level,
and PRO-NRG has done that
for me.
I was overweight,
and like many people,
I bought in to all
the products and gimmicks
that claimed
to melt the weight off.
The truth is, I was frustrated
with the results,
so I set out to create
my own answer
and I brought it down
to the basics--
Rehydrate, replenish,
refresh.
I hustled my way
through doors
and I got PRO-NRG
into over 3,000 stores
in the New York area.
Wow.
Wow.
Sharks, I need your investments
to fill my purchase orders
and propel PRO-NRG
onto the national market.
I'd like for you each
to have a try
so you can really experience
what PRO-NRG will do for you.
(groans) Oh.
Wow. What...
why does it taste so bad?
Taste so bad?
Yeah.
It tastes chemical-y.
I don't think it's bad
at all.
You ever taste
protein products?
No.
That's--there it is.
That's the difference, yeah.
Believe me, this is something
that tastes right.
Tania, what am I actually
buying here?
Do I get a boost?
Am I trying to get jacked up?
Or am I trying
to lose weight?
It's the only one
of its kind.
PRO-NRG simplifies
what your body needs.
Is this like a gatorade
or like a red Bull?
No.
It's not either one--
Either one of those.
Is it a weight loss product?
These guys have never
been in a gym,
so they--they don't quite
understand.
This is a complement
to a workout.
You wanna rehydrate
and you also want protein
to rebuild your muscles.
But, mark, shouldn't pro-"nurg"
Tell me that?
It's pro-"energy."
Pro-"n.R.G." (chuckles)
"n.R.G."
Okay. Whatever.
It's actually a great name.
Pro-"nurg"?
no, PRO-NRG.
Listen,
it's all fun and games
till Brandon comes over there
and crack your head open.
Nah, I'm--I'm not--I'm not
really... (speaks indistinctly)
he's not gonna...
then I will give you
the money--
I will give you
the money for that!
Oh, really?
Yeah, baby.
(sharks laugh)
put the ring on, too,
when you do it.
(chuckles) okay.
Brandon, you're obviously
a businessman.
So why do you guys need
the capital?
To get a 2-Time
super bowl champion
as part of my team--
You know,
I brought Brandon on,
but I'm not looking for him
to be an investor.
You guys are business--
Businessmen.
Why--Why isn't he
an investor?
Because I am an endorser.
Who do you play for?
San Francisco 49ers.
And what position
do you play?
Running back.
Played the last seven years with
the 2-Time super Bowl champion
New York giants.
I don't know if you had it
when you were with the giants.
Are--Are you gonna have it
in the niners' locker room?
We had it with the giants
throughout the playoff run,
then we went to indianapolis
to play in the super bowl.
Those guys--they loved it.
Guys were sharing.
Like, the--the bottles,
you drink half and another guy
drink half of that.
Like, it--It--It was crazy.
You guys had a big ol' comeback,
right? The second half?
Yeah.
Was that the difference?
So I couldn't tell if that
was the reason why...
no, I know. I know.
I know. I know.
We went and won.
But they loved it.
I like that.
You're not giving us the B.S.,
but you believe in it.
I like that.
Tell us about the economics
of the business--
what you're sales are, how
business is going in general.
I have invested $75,000.
It cost me $1.10 to make
per bottle,
But those costs will be
significantly dropped
once I reach certain benchmarks
in quantity.
What do you sell it
to the wholesaler for?
$1.80.
Ugh. I hate it.
So you're making 70 cents margin
but still, it's not horrible.
And what does it retail for?
$3.99.
Well, good margin for them,
bad margin for you.
Tania, you realize
that your distributors are
making more money than you?
Well...
that's upside down.
That's what life is like
in hell.
You have to make more money
than they do. That's crazy.
You gotta pay your dues
in whatever business you're in.
You're not worried about it
because you're not on
the P&amp;l side.
You're taking it off the top.
I as an investor would be very
concerned about those margins.
That's how
I get my money back.
In what kind of retailers?
We're in
all the delis and markets
that flooded in manhattan,
and also big box retailers.
You told us
you're in 3,000 stores
how much have you sold
in the last year?
Okay, we've been in the--
um, on the market
for just about
three months now.
We've done $126,000
in sales.
$120,000 in sales
in 3 months?
Yes.
I'm surprised, Tania, you--You
haven't been slaughtered yet.
Somehow you've survived.
Maybe the right partnerships.
I don't know. But you are not
worth $1.7 million
under any scenario. You've got
way too much to prove.
Good luck to you,
but I'm out.
Yep.
Here's what I see.
You've got a great idea,
great product.
You've got a great angle because
you got Brandon and New York.
Now he's gonna go out
to san Francisco.
That's not the challenge.
The challenge is never the first
act. It's like the nfl.
The nfl stands for
"not for long"
for a lot of people.
He's absolutely correct.
It's the same thing
in your business here.
The hard part is
the second act.
After the newness wears off,
after someone tries
to knock you off
and comes out with
super PRO-NRG,
then that's the hard part.
I hate businesses where
everybody and their brother
is trying to get in.
To me, if you're looking
where everybody else is looking,
you're looking
in the wrong spot.
I try to go
where people aren't.
So for that reason,
I have to say I'm out.
Okay.
Tania, you've failed to be clear
as to what the product was
after a lot of conversation.
Even when I look
at your packaging here,
it's even confusing
as a stand-Alone.
And I just wanna
make a note about Brandon.
I don't think you utilize him
well at all.
He's great.
The first time he engaged me
was when he told
his locker room story.
I'm picturing this pitch
all over,
and him coming out
and him starting it and saying,
"I was in my locker room--"
"and we were losing
the super bowl.
Then I hit the pro-'Nurg'."
Yeah. (chuckles)
"Wham!"
wham! Anything like that!
"We win!"
PRO-"nurg."
Pro-"energy"!
but because of the confusion
of your message alone,
which it you've gotta clean up,
I'm out.
Tania, you've done
an amazing job.
I don't think we've ever had
anybody out here
that's been in business
for the amount of time you have
with the distribution
that you have.
I mean, it's unbelievable.
You must be the best salesperson
we've ever met.
But, you know, my concern is,
besides the cash,
I think you need somebody
who understands this space.
For me,
it's an energy drink space.
It's just not something
I wanna compete in.
You know, for that reason, um...
don't say it. (chuckles)
I'm out.
(sighs)
okay.
Yeah.
Way it is.
Tania, there are
four sharks out.
Only one remains--Daymond.
Okay, Daymond.
Listen, you know,
my challenges with this,
I think is what all the sharks
have--Have vocalized.
Uh, you know,
very high valuation,
such a-a hard market
to get into.
But the good side of it
is that, um,
I just invested in a-a bunch
of crossfits.
I'm starting to understand
how much people want
this type of stuff.
I forbid you to pay
$1.7 million for this.
I forbid you.
I'm gonna give you
$250,000 for 30%,
but that is contingent
on me taking it to
a protein and supplement
company
that I have
a partnership with--
It's called badass--
And closing a deal
with them.
And, Brandon,
I need you in the room
telling that super bowl story,
to help us sell this thing.
I got you.
Just in case you hadn't notice,
shark Daymond has cut
your value in half.
Mm-hmm.
I realize that,
but I need his know-How, how to
navigate through those meetings.
Is that a "Yes"?
that's a "Yes," Daymond.
All right!
Congratulations.
I hope it's not the energy drink
making me do this.
(all laugh)
You jumped up
pretty fast there.
I did. I did.
All right. Thank you.
All right. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(Daymond and Barbara)
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
See ya, guys.
(Kevin) I think you need
to reposition this.
I don't think anybody
understands what it is.
Anybody who works out
understands completely.
