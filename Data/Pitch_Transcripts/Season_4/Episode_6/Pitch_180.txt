Hi. My name is
Tania Patruno...
Tania, what am I actually
buying here?
Do I get a boost?
Am I trying to get jacked up?
Or am I trying
to lose weight?
It's the only one
of its kind.
PRO-NRG simplifies
what your body needs.
Is this like a gatorade
or like a red Bull?
No.
It's not either one--
Either one of those.
Is it a weight loss product?
These guys have never
been in a gym,
Tania, you realize
that your distributors are
making more money than you?
Well...
that's upside down.
That's what life is like
in hell.
You have to make more money
than they do. That's crazy.
You gotta pay your dues
in whatever business you're in.
You're not worried about it
because you're not on
the P&amp;l side.
You're taking it off the top.
I as an investor would be very
concerned about those margins.
That's how
I get my money back.
In what kind of retailers?
I'm surprised, Tania, you--You
haven't been slaughtered yet.
Somehow you've survived.
Maybe the right partnerships.
I don't know. But you are not
worth $1.7 million
under any scenario. You've got
way too much to prove.
Good luck to you,
but I'm out.
Yep.
Here's what I see.
You've got a great idea,
great product.
Tania, you've failed to be clear
as to what the product was
after a lot of conversation.
Even when I look
at your packaging here,
Tania, you've done
an amazing job.
I don't think we've ever had
anybody out here
that's been in business
for the amount of time you have
with the distribution
that you have.
I mean, it's unbelievable.
You must be the best salesperson
we've ever met.
But, you know, my concern is,
besides the cash,
Tania, there are
four sharks out.
Only one remains--Daymond.
Okay, Daymond.
Listen, you know,
my challenges with this,
I think is what all the sharks
have--Have vocalized.
Uh, you know,
very high valuation,
such a-a hard market
to get into.
But the good side of it
is that, um,
I just invested in a-a bunch
of crossfits.
