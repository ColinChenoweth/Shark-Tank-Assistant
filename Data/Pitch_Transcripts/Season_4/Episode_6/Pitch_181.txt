I'm Jim Tselikis...
and I'm Sabin Lomac.
And we are cousins
from Portland, Maine.
And together, we are
Cousins Maine Lobster.
Best part about growing up
in Maine is the family,
being by the water,
but most importantly,
the lobster.
Maine lobster is
the most tender, succulent meat
you'll ever have.
We are from Maine But currently
living in Los Angeles.
Who wants
some fresh Maine lobster?!
in Los Angeles right now, there
is a food truck phenomenon,
and we want to combine
the two best industries going.
Hot meat coming right up.
Right now,
our business is booming.
We have lines
around the block
and we can't service
the people.
We need another truck
and we can't do it on our own,
so it's so important for us
to get this investment
from the sharks.
Whoo-Hoo-Hoo-Hoo!
Hi, sharks. My name is
Sabin Lomac.
And I am his Younger cousin
Jim Tselikis.
And together, we are
Cousins Maine Lobster.
Sharks, we're here seeking
$55,000
in exchange
for 5% of our company.
Sharks, picture this.
It's summertime in Maine.
Both locals and tourists alike
are in line
at Maine's iconic
lobster shack.
They're standing alongside
the Atlantic ocean,
smelling that salty air.
Most importantly, they are
eagerly awaiting the chance,
the opportunity,
to sink their teeth
into Maine's signature dish--
The lobster roll.
Sharks,
at cousins Maine lobster,
we bring
the Maine lobster experience
to Southern California,
and we do it via our amazing
gourmet lobster shack on wheels.
We get our lobsters from shore
to door in less than 24 hours.
So you know what that means,
Barbara?
Next time you're eating
with the cousins,
you are having
the freshest fare possible.
Here's the thing.
Right now, we need to add
another truck or two
because frankly, we can't
keep up with our own demand,
and that's where
you come in.
We would love for one of you
to join our family business
and become the third cousin.
Can we try it?
Absolutely.
You certainly can. Absolutely.
All right! With that buildup...
Yeah.
How did you get the lobster
from Maine to California?
Barbara, stop.
Let's try it first.
Oh, I can eat and listen
at the same time.
We ship everything fresh
every day, including the bread,
from Maine to Los Angeles.
So you have two different types
of our rolls.
One of them is the signature
Maine lobster roll.
(Robert) Oh!
Uh, split-top bun,
fresh Maine lobster meat,
a little bit of mayonnaise.
And then you have
our connecticut roll.
That has
the little lemon on top.
This is fantastic.
Mmm!
I'm glad you enjoy it.
You know, and that's--and that's
the freshest of Maine.
That's what we grew up with,
we were privy to all the time.
Is your supplier a cousin?
Great question.
Maine lobster industry is not
something you can call into
And, uh, you know,
get the access and the pricing
that we have.
You grow up with it.
But you're saying
you're the only one
who can get this?
So they are your family?
They're not family, but we--
the Mainers. The roots.
We grew up with them.
Be careful with that.
There are multiple suppliers
of lobster meat in Maine.
There are multiple suppliers
of lobsters,
but it just depends on
the pricing
that you're getting it at
in order to ship it wholesale
across the country.
And that's where we come in
because--
Because This is where
I'm getting a little concerned,
guys.
$55,000 for 5%.
Basically, you wanna buy
another truck with my $55,000.
You're valuing this business
at over a million bucks.
$1.1 million.
You haven't heard a word
about the business.
(Robert) Yeah, you don't know.
I know the business already,
Mark.
So what are you worried
about the valuation?
They may have ten trucks,
so you--How many trucks
do you have?
Right now,
we have one truck.
Ooh.
$150,000 of sales.
We've been open two months.
Two months?
One truck.
With one truck.
Where do you park the truck?
Literally all over
Los Angeles.
But how do people find you?
Twitter, web site,
social media.
Social media.
Okay, then let me ask you this.
Let's say I want to be
in the lobster business.
Mr. Wonderful's lobster, okay?
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)
Why don't I just go get
a couple of guys
with flip-flops on,
call up somebody in Maine
and say,
"I've got money.
You've got lobsters"...
Mm-hmm.
And do this whole thing
myself?
Why are you worth
$1.1 million?
We--
Come back with an answer
that maybe you won't
get sliced up into bun with.
You can start your own truck
and you can hire your own staff.
But what you can't do
is what you just said
and call up on the phone
to Maine.
They don't do business
with other guys outside.
It's not--It's not like that.
So you're the only guys--
'cause you've only even been
in business two months--
These guys only deal
with you now because they--
they haven't been in business
the last 50 years?
No, no, no. Of course.
You know, they have.
And--And we--
You are very greedy crustaceans,
both of you.
(chuckles nervously)
Jim, I don't think anybody's
buying your story.
I am.
It's not--It's not greed.
You haven't gotten into
the economics per truck.
Right.
You haven't talked about
seasonality.
You haven't talked about
any other cost issues
that might come along.
Right. So we're locked into
our pricing,
and typically, prices will rise.
With our connections and what
we have with our supplier,
we're locked in.
What we're paying right now,
we're gonna be paying
in the winter.
So what are you paying
right now on a--
what's the average?
The traditional lobster roll,
we price at $13.
What's your cost on that?
$5.85.
Guys,
I asked you the question
about the economics
of the truck.
Mm-hmm.
So please,
somebody who might invest,
tell me what the economics are
per truck.
Okay, so we'll start with,
how much is a purchase?
You buy it for roughly--
Ours was $65,000.
Okay.
Monthly overhead
with our employees--
$20,000.
Per truck or...
per truck.
Okay.
(Daymond and Robert) a month?
A month. Mm-Hmm.
Okay, so 20k per month
per truck.
If you have
more than one truck,
does it get advertised
across the truck?
The overhead would actually
go down a little
because we've hired
a general manager.
You're not the general manager
in this little business?
(stammers)
Well--Well--Well,
there's a reason why that,
is because when we got
into this business,
we knew a lot about lobster.
We knew a lot about
the service industry.
We didn't know a lot about
the trucking business.
How did you get
into the business?
How'd you get from Maine to...
(Jim) Great question. We--
Bring your lobster
over here to California?
So we both grew up in Maine.
And, uh, he's been out here
about eight years--Sabin has.
What brought you out here
eight years ago?
I used to do a lot of acting,
and I translated
that into, uh, real estate
and I've become successful
at real estate.
It allowed me to--to save
some money and do well.
He's still a great actor.
He's acting like a greedy pig,
asking for $55,000 for 5%.
No. No. Honestly, we're not
trying to be greedy.
What is in it for us?
To be a part of this family,
just like we need you.
And to make money.
Guys, these guys are talking
all kinds of nonsense.
I had asked you what
the economics of the truck were.
You know what?
Because you thought it was
more important
to talk about all the nonsense
and couldn't see through
the nonsense...
that's not fair, Mark.
I'm out.
Oh, my god, mark. What?
Yeah, what's that about?
(Kevin) He was never in.
It was a simple question.
It was a simple question.
You guys went--
(Robert) wow.
They weren't ignoring you.
You're starting to act
like Daymond, like a baby.
(laughs)
OHH!
So why don't you--
So why don't you let it go?
No, 'cause I--
I asked it twice. I asked
the question twice, not once.
So, Barb, are you gonna
write 'em a check?
You know what?
I am gonna write them a check.
Yes, I am, big mouth.
Pipe down, little man.
Let's go. Let's go.
(Robert) All right,
write 'em a check.
Barb, just 'cause
you're an old crab
doesn't mean you should get
into the lobster business.
Whoa! Daymond!
Are there other competitors?
There--Sometimes there are
two other competitors,
to our knowledge.
Are they selling
Maine lobster like you?
Of course they are.
There's none in Texas.
Who cares? Who cares where
the lobsters come from?
(laughs)
Guys, here. Help me,
'cause--'cause I like the idea.
Yes.
And I know this is very hot
and people are loving this.
Help me get to the $1 million--
$1.1 million valuation.
It's so high.
It's so ridiculous. Yes.
It's outrageous,
what you're asking for.
Okay.
I can't take anymore.
For the sake of lobsters
who are still alive, I'm out.
Okay.
So the bottom feeder's out.
(Jim chuckles)
to--to your point,
we are first month, $65,000.
The second month, $85,000.
Fantastic.
We're getting calls
'round the clock.
We have to turn down
catering events.
We're getting--
We're turning down business.
I'm gonna tell you
the honest truth.
Maybe you don't know this
about my history.
I was a commercial fisherman
for a year...
Yep.
And I worked
in a red lobster for ages.
(Jim and Sabin)
We did know that.
All right?
So I do understand
a little bit of the market.
You're making everything--
The fact that you just have
a contact in Maine?
I mean, one of the only places
you can buy lobster,
which everybody
buys lobster from.
So for $55,000,
you are offering 5%.
That is crazy.
You're kinda like
halfway in a body bag
without the zipper pulled up
right now.
Give me your best offer.
he feels Sabin and Jim have
grossly overvalued
their company
and has given them
one last chance
to make him a better offer.
Give me your best offer.
I mean...
I would feel
really comfortable
right around the 7% to 8%.
(sharks laugh)
You know what?
You're a very good actor.
You said that
with a straight face.
So, uh, I'm out.
Okay. Okay.
Thank you.
Ay, yi yi.
I really like you guys.
I think you're hustlers.
I like to invest in people
that like to get up every day
and work their Butts off.
And that's what we're doing.
Right.
So I'll give you the $55,000,
but I want 25%.
Okay.
Okay.
Is that an offer
you would entertain?
I do not think so, no.
(speaks indistinctly)
Can we hear Barbara's?
Well, I'm going
to offer you your $55,000,
and--But for
that amount of money,
I would like to have 17%
of your business.
17%.
And you--And you know why?
'cause 17's my lucky number.
Sabin, I'm really good at
building businesses quickly.
Hey, I think the way
I'm gonna get my money back
is by having more trucks
on the street.
So let me change my offer.
I'll give you $100,000, 'cause
I think you need more money
to get more trucks
on the street.
So $100,000 for 25%.
You don't need that much money,
do you?
(sighs)
You've got one offer
for $100,000 for 25%,
and Barbara, who likes
the lucky number 17...
who's randomly pulling
your value out of the air,
which she often does.
What are you going to do?
Our last question--
Strategies? Thoughts that
you guys might have?
Great question.
The best thing
I could do for you
which this guy cannot do is,
I am a genius marketer.
I am. I have it in my bones,
in my blood.
It always works.
I'm never wrong.
I think your truck is terrible.
Forgive me. Don't feel offended.
It's not a personal thing.
I can't believe
your two handsome faces
aren't side-By-Side
in caricatures as the cousins.
I don't even like the fact that
"Cousins Maine lobster"
doesn't say
"Cousins fresh Maine lobster."
It should have "fresh" in there.
Let me get my hands
in that business
and I'll tell you
everything wrong with it.
I have to agree
with Krusty krab over there.
She has some
great marketing ideas.
All right, let--Let me answer
that question.
Uh, you gotta be kidding me.
There's a reason I'm up here.
I-I don't need to prove
what I can do...
But they asked you.
To you.
You wanna go in
and change their business?
Do you need a job, Barbara?
I wanna help them.
Go ahead.
My offer's off the table.
No, I help every entrepreneur
I'm in business with.
You're left with Barbara.
I have a job.
Robert, you're out?
I'm out.
That was the butter and lemon
right there.
Okay, So, uh...
Barbara,
would you consider 12%?
(chuckles)
(mouths word)
Okay.
Why are you guys holding on
so tightly to the equity?
Because it's--It's--
It's our baby. It's--
80% of a watermelon is
better than 100% of a grape.
Mark, you said, "5% of something
is better than 0% of nothing"
in the past.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna meet you halfway.
The $55,000 for 15%.
Halfway between
the 12% and the 17%.
J.T.?
Let's go.
Barbara,
welcome to the family.
(Jim laughs)
Thank you.
Come on over here.
Come bring it in.
Baby, I'm coming.
Have you ever had
a lobster sandwich?
I'm coming!
(Robert) WHOA!
It's a family show, guys!
All right!
Get on in here.
Give me a hug!
(laughs)
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
Guys, I was wrong.
You came to make a deal.
Congrats.
Thank you.
By the way,
their stuff is incredible.
Let's see 'em out, baby.
(laughs)
the future with Barbara--
Sky's the limit.
And, uh, I think
she likes us, Jim.
I think she likes you
a little more than me.
Oh, well, typically.
That's usually how it goes.
Yeah, but--But either way,
we feel really, really good
about it
and, uh, we're excited.
