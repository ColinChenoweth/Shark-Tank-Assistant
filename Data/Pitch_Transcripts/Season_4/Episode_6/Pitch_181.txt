Hi, sharks. My name is
Sabin Lomac.
Jim, I don't think anybody's
buying your story.
I am.
It's not--It's not greed.
You haven't gotten into
the economics per truck.
Right.
You haven't talked about
seasonality.
You haven't talked about
any other cost issues
that might come along.
Right. So we're locked into
our pricing,
(Jim) Great question. We--
Bring your lobster
over here to California?
So we both grew up in Maine.
So the bottom feeder's out.
(Jim chuckles)
to--to your point,
we are first month, $65,000.
The second month, $85,000.
Fantastic.
We're getting calls
'round the clock.
We have to turn down
catering events.
We're getting--
We're turning down business.
I'm gonna tell you
the honest truth.
Maybe you don't know this
about my history.
I was a commercial fisherman
for a year...
Sabin, I'm really good at
building businesses quickly.
Hey, I think the way
I'm gonna get my money back
is by having more trucks
on the street.
So let me change my offer.
I'll give you $100,000, 'cause
I think you need more money
to get more trucks
on the street.
So $100,000 for 25%.
You don't need that much money,
do you?
(sighs)
You've got one offer
for $100,000 for 25%,
(Jim laughs)
Thank you.
Come on over here.
Come bring it in.
