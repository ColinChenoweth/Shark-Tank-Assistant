Uh, my name is Zach.
I invented this thing
called a freaker.
And I'm here today
looking for
a $200,000 investment
in exchange for a 10% equity
in my company freaker usa.
So...
? dun, dun, dun, dun, dun ?
This is a freaker.
We have over 35 designs.
We add characters and
personalities to all of them.
The freaker's function
is that it has magical fibers
in it to make it stretch
so they can fit every beverage
in the world.
? Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo ?
so you can put it
on your morning beer
if you wanted to.
? Boop-Boop-a-doop-a-Doop
boop-Boop ?
? boom-Boom-a-Doom ?
hmm?
(laughs)
All right?
And the freaker will fit every
water bottle in the world.
That is pretty crazy.
Every water bottle.
For my last trick, I'm gonna put
This little tiny freaker
on This huge wine bottle.
As you can see,
there are no wires attached.
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
Uh, there's nothing
up my sleeve.
Nothing in my beard.
Daymond, you wanna check
my beard to make sure?
No, I'm good.
You're good? All right.
Can I get a "whoop"?
(sharks) whoop.
Robert, I love you.
Love you, man.
All right. ? Doo, doo-Doo
doo-Doo doo-Doo-Doo ?
ooh!
Uh, without any further ado,
I have a little video
to show you guys,
um, more about it.
Hope you enjoy. Here we go.
Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo!
Boop! Now.
(man) This is the birth
of freaker usa.
(Zach) Living in a car,
traveling,
found a new home
in wilmington, north Carolina,
invited to a stitch 'n bitch
and learned to knit
a beer koozie.
Horrible knitter But wanted to
give them to all my friends.
Found old sweaters,
cut them up,
sewed them into beer koozies,
started feeling bad
about destroying
too many sexy sweaters,
ate pancakes, felt better,
found a small
mom-and-Pop hosiery mill
in Troy, north Carolina,
communicated through
song and dance.
Yay, they program robots
to spit out freakers.
Whew! Formed a team,
launched a web site,
made a bunch
of crazy marketing videos,
battled gandalf,
danced on a fire hydrant,
turned a box truck
into a house,
drove around the country
throwing
grilled cheese parties,
blew up some trade shows,
went on "Shark Tank,"
got a huge investment
for a small equity share,
stopped all bottles
from WETTING moist handshakes
in the world.
Yay, I'm freakin' excited.
Can I get a whoop?
Whoop! Whoop! (laughs)
You're a strange cat.
Oh, I've got--I've got some
freakers for you guys,
before I forget.
Here we go.
Awesome.
Zach, is this
is actual package?
Um, this is the package.
This just--
Um, these are the first freakers
that are packaged this way.
Thanks, Zach.
Yeah.
Zach, I hate to bring it
down to money,
but I always do.
Mm-hmm. What do you got?
Uh, $200,000 for 10%
is telling me
that you think
your freaker business
is worth $2 million.
Now I'm a believer.
I'm a believer, baby.
I'm gonna make you believe.
So why don't you tell me what
your sales are in the last year?
In the last year--We've only
been out for 13 months.
Uh, we're about $320,000.
Whoa!
(Kevin) So you're not so crazy.
You're making money.
Where are they--
Where are you selling them?
Uh, we have them in
about... 200 stores.
We've got
a japanese distributor,
a canadian distributor.
So--So, uh, this is not
a-a new idea.
Why is it, uh,
doing so well?
It is a new idea on the concept
that it's one drink insulator
that'll stretch
and fit everything.
No, I've seen it in lycra
and spandex and a few--
We have a patent on it.
Issued?
Yes.
What's your cost
per freaker?
Right about a dollar,
little under a dollar.
And what's
your wholesale cost?
Uh, wholesale starts at $4,
and suggested retail's
$8 to $10.
Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo.
Zach, I have
one more question.
Uh-Huh?
Why do you keep making
those noises?
(all laugh)
'cause it's cool.
(laughs)
So, Zach, I get
the whole lifestyle thing.
I buy into that.
Mm-hmm.
It's a brand builder.
The "doo-Doo-Doo-Doo"--
I love it all.
(laughs)
Now let's talk about
what your business
is really worth.
Let's say you're gonna do
$320,000 in the last--
Just over 11 months,
you said, right?
Uh, yeah.
So let's annualize that.
You're making about 15%
to the bottom line
before you pay tax--
Approximately.
Uh-huh.
You're worth somewhere between
350,000 and 400,000 bucks.
That's it.
Okay.
So I think I need 50%.
That would be
a reasonable valuation.
Yeah.
What do you say to that?
Um, I'd probably make some beeps
at ya and... (chuckles)
(all laugh)
Well, I'm just saying,
while we're beeping...
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, I-I wouldn't--I wouldn't
entertain it seriously.
Okay, Zach, baby.
Beep-Beep-Beep.
(laughs)
I'm out.
Okay.
Another cool thing
that we didn't touch on,
on the video,
there was a box truck
that we turned into a house
and we drove around the country,
throwing grilled cheese parties.
It's one of
our forms of marketing.
But isn't that kind of
the challenge, right?
I-I think it's cool.
You go around
to all the festivals.
You guys can set up at--
Huh? Not festivals.
You don't go to festivals at all
and set up?
Not right now. I don't really
like festivals, no.
Okay--
You don't like festivals?
(chuckles)
No.
(Barbara laughs)
No.
(Robert laughs)
You seem perfect
for festivals.
I seem that way. I'm not--
I'm not much of a festival guy.
Really?
No.
What do you do
in your off time?
I get up early, usually go to
the river, walk dogs.
Let me tell you. How you valued
the company, it's nutsy.
On that basis alone,
although I love you,
I'm out.
Okay.
I love you, too, Barbara.
I love you, too.
I get the entire brand.
Yeah.
But there's no beeping way...
(laughs)
You're worth $2 million today.
Well, uh, there obviously--
I feel like there must be
some, like,
missing on your guys' part
of where I'm at
if you're not getting
even close to that.
Look, I like you, Zach...
Yeah.
But, you know, it's--It's--
It's--It's hard.
I-I can promise you,
you'd be into it.
I-I could say in six months,
you're gonna be like...
(high-Pitched voice)
man, what was I thinking?
Oh, Zach, you know what?
I gotta be honest with you.
When I'm not up here,
I'm dressed like you
and hanging out
and dancing everywhere.
We could have some, like,
umbrella drinks
and we'd kick it back...
(laughs)
Holler at some girls?
I'm out.
All right, Robert.
So, Zach, uh, you know,
I have to be passionate
about everything I invest in...
Yeah.
And I'm just not feeling
that way about this.
I'm out.
Okay. All right, you got
some words of wisdom?
You know, the reality is,
your margin's great.
The opportunity for branding
and putting a mavs logo
or whatever logo,
the incremental cost
is probably minimal.
So there's some
unique opportunities there.
But if I had to listen to,
"beep-Beep-Beep! Hey, Mark.
Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep!
What's up?"
(trills)
"beep-Beep-Beep!"
I'd shoot myself. I'm out.
Now we need to hear the beeping
of you backing up.
Boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop.
Beep! Beep!
All right. Love you, guys.
Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom.
Boom-Boom-Boom-Boom.
Mark, I thought you were in
for sure at the end.
Hell, no!
I-I love his technique. I'm-a do
that at my next meeting.
(trills)
what it was like
in the Shark Tank?
It was like,
beep, beep, beep, beep.
Beep!
Ah! (laughs)
