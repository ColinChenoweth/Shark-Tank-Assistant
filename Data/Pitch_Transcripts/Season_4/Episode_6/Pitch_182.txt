Uh, my name is Zach.
I invented this thing
called a freaker.
(Zach) Living in a car,
traveling,
found a new home
in wilmington, north Carolina,
invited to a stitch 'n bitch
Zach, is this
is actual package?
Um, this is the package.
This just--
Um, these are the first freakers
that are packaged this way.
Thanks, Zach.
Yeah.
Zach, I hate to bring it
down to money,
but I always do.
Mm-hmm. What do you got?
Uh, $200,000 for 10%
is telling me
that you think
your freaker business
is worth $2 million.
Now I'm a believer.
I'm a believer, baby.
I'm gonna make you believe.
So why don't you tell me what
your sales are in the last year?
In the last year--We've only
been out for 13 months.
Uh, we're about $320,000.
Whoa!
(Kevin) So you're not so crazy.
You're making money.
Where are they--
Where are you selling them?
Uh, we have them in
about... 200 stores.
We've got
a japanese distributor,
a canadian distributor.
So--So, uh, this is not
a-a new idea.
Why is it, uh,
doing so well?
It is a new idea on the concept
that it's one drink insulator
Zach, I have
one more question.
Uh-Huh?
Why do you keep making
those noises?
(all laugh)
'cause it's cool.
(laughs)
So, Zach, I get
the whole lifestyle thing.
I buy into that.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, Zach, baby.
Beep-Beep-Beep.
(laughs)
I'm out.
Okay.
Another cool thing
that we didn't touch on,
on the video,
there was a box truck
that we turned into a house
Look, I like you, Zach...
Yeah.
But, you know, it's--It's--
It's--It's hard.
I-I can promise you,
you'd be into it.
I-I could say in six months,
you're gonna be like...
(high-Pitched voice)
man, what was I thinking?
Oh, Zach, you know what?
I gotta be honest with you.
When I'm not up here,
I'm dressed like you
So, Zach, uh, you know,
I have to be passionate
about everything I invest in...
Yeah.
