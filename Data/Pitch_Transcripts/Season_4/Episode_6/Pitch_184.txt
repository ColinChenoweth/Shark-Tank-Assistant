Hi, sharks. I'm Mona Weiss...
and I'm Scott Shields.
And our company is Eco Nuts.
We are here seeking $175,000
for a 15% stake
in our company.
Eco Nuts is a line of
eco-friendly cleaning products
packaged with little
to no plastic.
Now I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, it's another
green Cleaning company."
But Eco Nuts
are totally different.
Most of our products
are certified organic
and are based on this.
This is our secret weapon.
It's an organic berry
from the himalayas
that naturally produces a soap.
It's called a soapberry,
or soap nut,
thus our name Eco Nuts.
You can use these berries
for laundry
by placing
four to five of 'em...
place them into the wash bag
like so,
directly in your machine.
When it comes in contact
with the water,
it releases a natural soap
as it gets shaken around,
which can do your laundry.
This jar of water is gonna
represent your washing machine.
I'm gonna place in one.
It makes soap. Isn't that cool?
(laughs)
(Mona) You can... (laughs)
It's still solid.
Well, it does--You can
reuse these up to ten times.
(sharks) Ah.
This box here does
a year's worth of laundry,
and it replaces ten bottles
of detergent.
And now is the perfect time
to invest.
Americans spend over $70 billion
a year on cleaning products,
and with your help, we can
help take a bite out of it
and help save the planet.
What do you say, sharks?
You with us?
But why is it the perfect time
to invest?
Well, we were first
to the mainstream market,
and now, uh,
we are going to be everywhere.
We've managed to capture about
90% of the soapberry market
thus far by branding it--
(chuckles)
There's a soapberry market?
There is a soapberry market
out there, believe it or not.
Okay.
Scott, what percentage?
Uh, 90%
in less than 3 years.
(Daymond) How big is
the soapberry market?
(Kevin) How big is it annually?
It's--in the U.S., it's right
around about $1 million.
So you have $900,000
in sales?
No. I...
(sharks laugh)
I walked into that one,
didn't I?
Let's do the math.
(Mark) OHH!
All right. Wait.
Hold--Hold on a second.
Wait. I caught you
with your mouth open. I got it.
Let's uh--
why don't you put
one of those soapberries
in your mouth right now?
Can we--can we just go back
to Scott's point
of 90% market share?
Yeah. Okay.
(Mark) Yeah.
How much does that equate to
in terms of sales?
90% of market share--
for us, what it equates to is,
last year,
we did about $100,000.
This year, we're already
on track to do over $250,000.
Can I see a sample?
Why, yes.
Absolutely.
Got a tray for you
right here.
I love Mona.
Mona is a champ.
Are these the nuts?
Yes.
(Kevin) Thank you, Mona.
You're welcome.
Are the two of you married?
Not yet. We're working on it.
No. We're engaged.
(Kevin speaks indistinctly)
(mark and Daymond) AW!
(Robert) congratulations!
We--Oh, don't congratulate me.
We've been engaged
for five years.
(all laugh)
Scott, you animal!
Mona, Mona, let me ask you this.
Why does a guy stay engaged
for fives years?
Why would he do that?
We're not using the investment
money to get married,
but we need to bring
our business to the next level
so that we can get married.
(laughs)
Let's say this market
takes off.
You're assuming your brand
Eco Nuts
will maintain its dominance.
Oh, first of all,
we have a proprietary
sterilization process.
And we came up with this
because while he and I were
in our living room
Originally sorting berries,
and we had people who were
helping us out sorting berries,
we were all getting sick.
And we--we decided there must be
something going on with these,
so we sent them off to a lab,
and we found that they had
stuff on them.
Stuff on nuts. Imagine that.
So you had to get your nuts
sterilized?
So you found that they had
monkey poop on them?
(Scott) Exactly.
Everybody needs
their nuts sterilized.
And if you look into--
Basically, if you look into
trying Different
sterilization practices,
you'll find it's very difficult
to get one that is for organic.
I'm gonna ask you
an important question.
You have 90% of the market.
You say you've done
about $250,000.
You're, uh, asking for a little
over $1 million valuation.
Uh-huh.
Give me the valuation,
why you came up with that.
It--It's based on the fact that
every year we've been
in business,
we have doubled and tripled
our sales.
We started our company
with $1,000.
Now we didn't put anymore money
into it for over a year.
We made $10,000.
Our next year, we made $40,000.
Then we saw the business
was going somewhere.
We put it--
but you're still not making
any money.
We've--We've done over $100,000
this year already.
How did you secure
your customer base?
Well, I'm a social media ninja.
(laughs)
Ah.
We've got more fans on facebook
than you do, Barbara.
Well, I'm insulted.
And I'm out.
(Mark laughs)
There you go, Barbara!
Oh, don't be out yet!
(laughs) I'm only kidding.
(Mark) Barbara?
(Robert) WHOA!
No, no, no. I'm not.
Okay.
Look at that.
(laughs)
(Kevin) The market is
so small right now.
And what you've got--Like,
$1 million in sales in the U.S.
Means a tremendous amount
of education
that's to occur before
people who do laundry
are gonna start buying nuts.
It's gonna be a tough haul.
I'm not saying
it's impossible.
I'm not saying
you're not the best.
It's just that
your company today
is not worth over $1 million.
It just isn't. You're not making
enough money yet.
You're not even married yet.
For $175,000,
I'd probably have to own
all of this company right now.
I'm out.
So you say you're number one
in the market.
I'm trying to understand it.
Shouldn't have said that, Scott.
Right?
You said that the market is
$1 million...
it--It's not $1 million.
He messed up.
Domestically.
How do you not know
the numbers, Scott?
Right.
Hold on, Robert. Robert.
You shouldn't be making
these mistakes
and these assumptions.
I'm out.
Who do we have left here?
Robert?
You gotta know the numbers.
You can't come out and say,
"I own 90% of the market,"
and it turns out
you might own 10%, 15%.
I would like to
get into this business
because I do think
it's gonna grow.
At $175,000,
what possible offer
could I give you
that's reasonable from
a pure numbers perspective?
It's--It's not
a $1.2 million business today.
$175,000
for... 50%?
Would you consider that?
I'd consider it but I wouldn't
take it, unfortunately.
I mean...
just from what we've done...
(speaks indistinctly)
Well, you better be working
16 hours a day on our business,
like we do.
Sorry. What did you say?
Mona and Scott have one offer
on the table from Robert--
$175,000 for a 50% stake.
But Mona has questioned what
Robert will bring to the table
for such a high stake
in the business.
Just from what we've done...
(speaks indistinctly)
Well, you better be working
16 hours a day on our business,
like we do.
Sorry. What did you say?
(laughs) I said,
"you better be working
16 hours a day on our business,
like we do."
(laughs) For that kind of...
for that kind of money.
Oh--Oh, no, Mona. I worked
24 hours a day on my business
so I could have the privilege
of sitting up here
and listening
to people like you.
I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
Guys, I'll get right to
the point.
I think your marketing's
horrible.
There's nothing that's gonna
demonstrate to me
that your product is
any different than the others.
You're using berries
to do your clothes.
We sterilize ours.
But that's the point.
You may sterilize them,
but there's nothing there
that tells me
that you do that.
You've completely left out
your greatest differentiation.
Well, just the branding
and the look
of the boxes alone--
When you look at how
traditionally in the marketplace
where it's sold--
When I look at the boxes,
I'm gonna know
they're sterilized nuts?
At our size, advertising out
there in front of everybody...
"Oh, look.
Here's this, here's that.
Here's what we do
so differently"...
until we're actually large
enough to truly have
our big, big place--
You're giving me excuses.
Excuses are worthless.
I'm giving you a very solid
and valid reason
of how we managed to protect
ourselves in the business...
your packaging sucks.
Run rabid with dogs
and manage to climb our way up
to be number one.
Congratulations.
And we will not
be brought down,
even if another larger company
comes in--
You know what?
When you're done patting
yourself on the back,
you should look at
your marketing and say,
"the message this big board
sends me is not gonna
educate me on the fact that you
have a differentiated product."
You've completely
left it out,
and now you've left me out.
I'm out.
Okay.
Hi, sharkette.
Well, let me tell you,
the best part about
your pitch today
is you are
such a good couple.
It only take an hour
to get married.
Oh, my lord.
I think the Eco Nuts name
is great,
but beyond that,
I don't think you present
the product well at all.
Not really.
I'm out.
Well, thank you.
Well, thank you very much
for letting us show everything.
(Kevin)
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.
I also agree with Barbara
that you did
a genuinely terrible job.
But she really moved me
with something she said.
And I haven't done this before
on "Shark Tank,"
but I'm willing to do it today
because I am Mr. Wonderful.
Do you want me to
marry you now?
(all laugh)
Can you marry us?
Of course I can.
I'm Mr. Wonderful.
My parents would kill me.
I'm sorry. Then you leave
with nothing.
Well, get them on the line.
All right, guys.
Well, good luck.
(Mark) Good luck, guys.
Bye!
Scott, marry that woman.
Ah! (laughs)
I will!
Let me do it for you now!
(sharks laugh)
When Scott said that we had
a 90% share
of a $1 million market,
I was thinking,
oh, no. That's not what it is.
I didn't wanna, like, stop him
right then and there on air
'cause I didn't want
to embarrass him.
But, like, you know,
I-I didn't wanna...
it's okay. I do a great job
embarrassing myself. (laughs)
