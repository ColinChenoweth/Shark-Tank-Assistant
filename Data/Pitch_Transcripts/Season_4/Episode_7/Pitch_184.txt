Hey, sharks,
I'm Daniel Wood...
What Daniel's trying to say here
is that the sbu has some really
smart sensors inside of it
similar to the segway,
that will always
keep you balanced.
Why don't you show them
how it works, Dan?
The hardest part
of a regular unicycle
is the pedaling
to keep you balanced.
But you don't have to worry
about that at all
with the sbu.
It does all that for you
with no pedaling.
The sbu's motion is
intuitive to your movements,
(Robert) Let him go!
(Daniel laughs)
I can turn. Very cool.
How much are they?
Retail, $1,800.
I want one.
But I want a deal.
(laughter)
Make a deal,
we'll give you one for free.
I think I could get it.
I think I could get it.
Daniel, do you know
what happened
to, uh, one of the founders
of the segway?
He had an accident.
Yeah. He hopped on the segway,
Daniel, incredibly impressive.
You've definitely
got something there.
I buy the technology,
But not at
a $3 million value.
I mean, I'm happy to offer you
$300,000 for 33%.
I would join Robert if you
take me into that offer.
I just spent $5,000
ordering an electric bike.
I think that market's gonna
be absolutely huge,
