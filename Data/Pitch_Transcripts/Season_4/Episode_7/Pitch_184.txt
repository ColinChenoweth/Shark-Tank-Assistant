Hey, sharks,
I'm Daniel Wood...
and I'm David Martschinske,
and our product
is the first and only
electric
self-balancing unicycle,
or sbu for short.
We are asking for $300,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
So how does it work?
Basically, there are
three rate gyros,
three accelerometers,
a powerful 32-Bit processor
running p.I.D. Loops,
fuzzy logic, and kalman filters,
calculating the exact angle
of the sbu.
The motor is then
driven forward and backward
in a locked, anti-phase
P.W.M. Configuration.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Don't worry, sharks.
I speak nerd,
and I can provide
the translation.
What Daniel's trying to say here
is that the sbu has some really
smart sensors inside of it
similar to the segway,
that will always
keep you balanced.
Why don't you show them
how it works, Dan?
The hardest part
of a regular unicycle
is the pedaling
to keep you balanced.
But you don't have to worry
about that at all
with the sbu.
It does all that for you
with no pedaling.
The sbu's motion is
intuitive to your movements,
making riding feel easy
and second-nature.
And it's so portable,
you can put it
underneath your desk at work.
And because it's hands-Free,
if you're like Daniel,
you can program
a t.I.-85 graphing calculator.
What a nerd.
(laughs)
(laughter)
Even a nerdy laugh.
The sbu is capable of speeds
of 15 miles per hour,
and going ten miles
on a single charge.
What sharks are ready to
ride nerdy with these two guys?
Nerdy. (laughs)
(Robert) can I try it?
You want to come
see how it feels? Yeah.
We got a helmet for you.
Okay.
Here's how it works.
You turn the power on...
okay.
You see it--It's balancing
forward and back,
so you put your hand here,
you can feel it.
So you just
lean it forward...
Lean forward.
To get more speed,
and you lean it back
to slow down.
Whoa! You can
feel it moving.
Whoa--Whoa.
All right, hang on.
I gotta get this.
It takes about 20 minutes
to learn, usually,
in a large parking lot.
I gotta try it.
(Robert) All right.
Come on up here.
It's a lot harder than
I thought it would be.
In my early years
in the circus...
(laughter)
Just lean it forward
to go.
That is very cool.
Lean it back
to slow down.
(Robert) Let him go!
(Daniel laughs)
I can turn. Very cool.
How much are they?
Retail, $1,800.
I want one.
But I want a deal.
(laughter)
Make a deal,
we'll give you one for free.
I think I could get it.
I think I could get it.
And you've been selling them
for how long?
We just finished tooling up
our factory overseas.
First 100 units
are finishing up this week,
and we've already sold
all of them.
What was your cost?
$350,000 for this first run.
And you sold the first 100
at $1,800?
Yeah, just off of our web site.
Daniel, do you know
what happened
to, uh, one of the founders
of the segway?
He had an accident.
Yeah. He hopped on the segway,
and it fell into the river,
and he drowned.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't the segway work?
Why didn't people buy it?
The segway was hyped
like no other product.
I'm not gonna talk bad
about the segway,
but you can't do this
with the segway.
The nail in
the segway coffin
was banning it
from the sidewalk.
Have you gone
into that issue
and asked anybody
at the city level,
would you ban this device
from my city?
They're not nearly as big.
I don't think they're
gonna have a problem.
'cause it's single-Wheel.
It's not wide.
We've been stopped
by many officers,
only because
they love the product.
They ask the same questions
you guys do.
"When--Where can I get one?
They're cool."
I need to feel passionately
about whatever I invest in.
I love the two of you,
but I don't feel passionate
about this product.
For that reason,
I'm out.
You know, I was interested
for a second.
I was unaware that the segway
business model doesn't work.
Is that--that true, Robert?
Horrible.
Horrible. One of
the biggest losses
in terms of investment.
I am not willing
to take this risk.
I'm out.
A difficult decision.
I hate those,
because I'm very interested.
I see a lot of the merits.
But I don't know
if it's worth $3 million.
Well, let us tell you about
our--Our future sales.
A very conservative Number
is selling 1,000 of these
in 12 months,
which puts us
at $1 million profit.
You could do a million in profit
in the next 12 months?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
How are you guys gonna do
quality assurance
when it's produced overseas?
'Cause if--If you run into
any manufacturing issues at all,
you're toast.
We visited the factory.
We've already worked with them.
But having them tell you,
"Oh, we're good"
is a whole lot different
than them actually delivering
the quality that you expect.
I mean, look at apple.
They went through
the same thing, right?
Brilliant design.
But I hate trust--Trusting
overseas manufacturing.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
For me to give you
a $3 million valuation today,
I have to believe
in the mass transport market.
And I've seen other people
fail in that.
I know you're different.
Well, before
you say you're out,
we do have the most advanced
ebyte controller
on the market in here.
I designed
the circuit board.
I embedded a lot of technology
that's very proprietary to us.
Oh, I didn't realize that.
But do you have patents?
We have patents
filed, yes.
Filed.
We're already talking
with e-bike manufacturers
who want to license
this technology from us.
In fact, we've already licensed
it to one other company,
and we're receiving royalties
on that right now.
Wait a minute. You said--
You didn't say that before.
How much royalties
are you receiving?
$25,000 in royalties.
In how long?
About three months.
Daniel, incredibly impressive.
You've definitely
got something there.
I buy the technology,
But not at
a $3 million value.
I mean, I'm happy to offer you
$300,000 for 33%.
I would join Robert if you
take me into that offer.
I just spent $5,000
ordering an electric bike.
I think that market's gonna
be absolutely huge,
and it doesn't have
this technology in it.
Are there any other offers?
Anyone else wanna...
you're playing a very dangerous
balancing act right now.
You have two sharks interested
when honestly, I think
we were all gonna be out.
I don't think you should waste
much more time.
(Chin straps click)
Let's do it.
Yeah, let's do it, sharks.
All right.
Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations.
Come on, guys,
get excited about this.
Whoo!
There you go.
The technology's
gonna make money.
We're gonna make
a lot of money.
Congratulations, guys.
Man, that was awesome.
We just made a deal
with two of the biggest nerds
on "Shark Tank."
We're gonna make
a lot of money,
and we're gonna put
an sbu
in every cubicle
around America.
Nerds rule!
