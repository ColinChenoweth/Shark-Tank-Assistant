First into the Shark Tank
is Aaron Krause,
who believes his product will
make every day cleaning easier.
Hi, sharks. I'm Aaron Krause
from Philadelphia,
and I'm known as the daddy
of the Scrub Daddy,
the cutest but most high tech
scrubbing tool in the world.
Today, I'm seeking
a $100,000 investment
in exchange for 10% equity
in the Scrub Daddy business.
It's the greatest
kitchen scrubbing tool
you ever used,
because Scrub Daddy
completely changes its texture
by just adjusting
your water temperature.
Let me show you
how that works.
Here I've got some hot water.
Here I've got some cold water.
When I immerse the scrub daddies
in the hot and cold water,
a complete transformation
occurs.
Now to show you that,
I've got 10-pound weights.
Here, under the 10 pounds,
it's soft and compressible,
and that's like a sponge.
That's for your gentle
scrubbing application.
But here...
check that out.
It's hard and firm.
That's gonna be for heavy-Duty
scrubbing applications.
We burned on brown gravy,
tomato sauce,
cheese, and mustard
onto a glass stovetop
and a stainless steel pan.
I'm gonna take the Scrub Daddy,
and you're gonna see...
(scrubbing)
It's just gonna attack
right into that burned-on mess,
scrubbing it right off.
And remember,
I'm just using water here.
There's no chemicals at all.
And it's gonna cut
right through that.
It won't scratch
any of your surfaces
but it will clean them
beautifully.
Now Scrub Daddy's
not really smiling anymore,
so I'm gonna put him here
in the warm water.
And in just
a couple seconds...
voila.
He's back to bright, fresh,
and clean every time.
Sharks, that's not just
another smiling face.
You put it on your hand,
you can get to the bottom
and clean the sides
in one move.
And that smiling mouth,
that cleans spoons, knives,
forks, spatulas,
even large serving spoons
on both sides
at the same time.
Sharks, with your help,
Scrub Daddy will
be scrubbing and smiling
in every kitchen
in the world.
Whoo!
(Daymond and Lori) Wow!
Scrub Daddy!
I've never witnessed
a live infomercial.
That was fantastic.
That was incredible.
Do you have samples?
I do.
(Lori) Where are you
selling this now?
Thank you.
Well, currently we have it
in five supermarkets
in the Philadelphia area.
We also sell it
on our web site.
Thank you.
I've been on QVC three times
over about three months.
(Robert) And how'd it go?
Fantastic. They've invited me
back over and over.
And every time I go on,
they reorder 30% more
than the last time.
So Scrub Daddy is hummin'.
(Robert) And what were your
total sales--QVC, wholesale?
Just north of $100,000,
only in four months.
Do you have a patent on this?
I actually have a patent.
I have two more pending.
We have the trademark.
We have domain name.
Okay, Aaron, what do you need
the $100,000 for?
What I wanna do is set up
an independent
manufacturing facility
with automated equipment.
Why do you need to go
into your own facility?
The biggest problem is,
I'm on their time schedule.
Are you saying that you could
be making more revenue
if you're 24/7 making
scrub daddies?
The way QVC's going
and we're just about to launch
in a whole bunch of stores,
we're gonna need that capacity.
And I have 18 years experience
running a manufacturing plant
that runs 24 hours a day.
I know exactly what
I need to do
to make this thing
really efficient,
and I'm looking to add
a strategic partner
who can open this up
into the retail stores.
I'm only in five supermarkets.
That's it.
What's your cost?
The cost to make one's
about a dollar.
What are you selling 'em for?
About $2.80.
Wholesale?
Wholesale.
This needs to be
in every supermarket,
drug store, Walgreens, CVS.
(Kevin) It's so expensive.
Mrs. Schlubinski goes
to the store
and picks this off the shelf
and says,
"Hey, it's a piece of foam
with a Smiley face on it.
It costs 2 cents to make
in China."
That's what she's thinking.
'cause a brillo pad,
which is traditional product,
is what... a 20%--
You're comparing it to
the lowest end
of the lowest end.
You take it up to
the highest end,
talk about the--the ones
like dobie pads
or other pads out there
that are, you know, brand-name.
Scrub Daddy, I-I think
you've done a great job today,
but I don't know if it's
gonna work in retail.
I don't--I don't buy in
for that vision.
Just in the packaging,
I just don't know if I see
the difference.
Robert, I--
it doesn't sell on a shelf--
Correct.
But if you put it
in display shippers
which we've built--
These beautiful
cardboard display shippers--
and it communicates the message
to every one of the customers.
It sits on the end cabin.
You're gonna have to pay
for those things.
Well...
it's hard to get them,
even if you pay for them.
Great job today, but I-I don't
see the retail vision.
I'm out.
I understand.
I like the product.
I think you're--You're doing
great things.
You're doing this
the exact right way.
But when I hear "QVC"--
no disrespect to Lori--
When the company's sales are
completely dependent on QVC,
that's a disaster
waiting to happen.
Well, I-I've got 3,000 stores
lined up right now.
We're gonna be
in 3,000 stores.
I understand, but even...
Okay, put aside QVC.
You're still
a 1-product company.
Right?
Not for long.
We've got Scrub Mommy.
We've got Scrub Baby
for doing baby bottles.
I've got a holder
that sits it on your sink
and it's got drains
in the legs.
You don't understand
who you're dealing with.
(sharks laugh)
I am--I am the...
I'm not doubting
the scrub market.
I'm not doubting
you are the Scrub Daddy,
but I'm not a scrub pimp,
so I'm out.
That hurts, Mark.
I wanted to work with you
so bad.
Mark, QVC does
over $8 billion in sales a year,
and I've done
over $500 million myself.
Yes, you have, and you rotate
product in and out of there,
and once those products are out,
they're out.
How about this deal?
$100,000 for 50%?
(Mark and Robert laugh)
Let's start the bidding
there.
All right, you're out.
(chuckles)
You know, I'm somebody
who could paint any picture,
and I think that Lori is
a vicious, back-stabbing shark.
That's all true.
But sometimes
I love her as well,
because she is
the QVC queen.
So I'm offering $50,000
for 15%,
if you can raise the rest
from Lori,
and if she wants
to do business with me.
Well, here's the thing.
Aaron, they're like children
up here. It's awful.
Let's recap where we are.
Yeah, let's recap, please.
$150,000 for 25%...
okay.
From Daymond.
Kevin is--
$100,000 for no percent
and a tiny tithe of 10 cents.
You keep all the equity.
Lori is offering you
$100,000 for 25%.
I offered $150,000
last time.
Whoa! Hang on!
I-I didn't hear that.
You said $100,000, Lori.
Oh, well... I changed my mind.
$150,000 for 25%.
I'll make you a millionaire
within a year.
(Daymond) So mine just went
to $175,000.
(Kevin) WHOA!
It's up to $175,000?
Yeah.
Mine just went to $200,000.
(Kevin and Robert) whoa!
The good news is...
I just made you
an extra $100,000.
I'm out.
I wanted to stick it to her.
Ouch.
Wow.
I'll drop the 50 cents
down to 25 cents,
until the 100k
is recovered,
and then go to 10 cents.
Will you go to 5 cents?
7.5--It's a deal.
Okay, Aaron,
you've got two offers
on the table.
What are you gonna do?
You have to make up your mind
right now.
You don't see the benefit
of having me as a partner.
I never said that.
You need to tell me right now
whether you're going
with me or not
or I'm out.
I'm here for you.
I think your deal is awesome.
Um, the equity amount
is--Is too much.
Would you consider
coming down to 20%?
You know what? I will.
I'll go to 20%.
We got a deal.
We got a deal. Good!
All right!
Way to go, Aaron! Whoo!
Congratulations.
Thanks, Lori. I'm so excited.
You are dead to me
and the sponge is dead.
(laughs) Thanks, guys.
Scrub Daddy, you suck.
That is awesome!
Got a deal with Lori.
It's--It's a dream come true.
It's absolutely
a dream come True.
I don't care
how much money you have.
I am so satisfied to know
that you lost an extra $100,000.
I know you'll get me back,
but I just...
it's gonna be gangbusters--
Huge hit in infomercial.
(Robert) Good deal, Lori.
Great deal.
