First into the Shark Tank
is Aaron Krause,
who believes his product will
make every day cleaning easier.
Hi, sharks. I'm Aaron Krause
from Philadelphia,
Okay, Aaron, what do you need
the $100,000 for?
What I wanna do is set up
an independent
manufacturing facility
with automated equipment.
Why do you need to go
into your own facility?
The biggest problem is,
I'm on their time schedule.
Are you saying that you could
be making more revenue
if you're 24/7 making
scrub daddies?
Aaron, they're like children
up here. It's awful.
Let's recap where we are.
Yeah, let's recap, please.
$150,000 for 25%...
okay.
From Daymond.
Kevin is--
$100,000 for no percent
Okay, Aaron,
you've got two offers
on the table.
What are you gonna do?
You have to make up your mind
right now.
You don't see the benefit
of having me as a partner.
I never said that.
You need to tell me right now
whether you're going
with me or not
or I'm out.
I'm here for you.
I think your deal is awesome.
Um, the equity amount
is--Is too much.
Would you consider
coming down to 20%?
You know what? I will.
I'll go to 20%.
We got a deal.

All right!
Way to go, Aaron! Whoo!
Congratulations.
