I'm Shelton Wilder.
I love fashion.
I currently work
as a fashion stylist.
I want to get
a few looks for you.
My clients will come to me,
My name is Shelton Wilder,
So, Shelton, it's not
a fashion piece?
It's something to wear
underneath other clothing?
Yes, it's a foundation piece,
but not a shaper.
If you are
a larger woman,
is this going to accentuate
your largeness,
or diminish it?
The point is, is that there's
so many shapers on the market--
Things that squeeze you,
fat dislocators.
But these are made
to be comfortable.
You know, it's not always you
wanna squeeze into something
Tell us your background,
Shelton.
You know, you said
you're a personal stylist.
I have been in fashion
since I was 16.
I was a buyer,
then a manager.
I ran
this amazing store...
Where were you a buyer at,
Shelton, here--Here's the part
that I'm--
I'm still
a little confused about.
Okay.
The hardest thing in business
to build is a name.
Mm-hmm.
Hi! My name
is Shelton Wilder.
Shelton, I think Kevin's
out of line. I--

your passion.

Thank you. Good luck.

(Robert) Wow.
We did go on a journey
with her.
(Kevin) to nowhere.
