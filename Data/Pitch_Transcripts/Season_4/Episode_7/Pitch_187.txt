I'm Shelton Wilder.
I love fashion.
I currently work
as a fashion stylist.
I want to get
a few looks for you.
My clients will come to me,
and I will put
Their entire look together.
Their dress, their shoes,
their jewelry,
the entire thing.
Oh, it's really cute.
Okay.
I came up with my product
when I was styling
and managing a boutique,
and I needed this
for my clients,
and so it evolved
through sheer necessity.
My product is
the perfect piece
to help bring runway fashions
to real life.
And it's a must-Have
for every woman.
And literally, you'll wear this
and wonder how you ever
got dressed without it.
To get to where I am today,
I've overcome a lot.
There's been a lot,
a lot of struggles.
This is my second chance,
so I have a lot
riding on this.
I have the pattern here
that I need to send to you.
My business
is a work in progress,
and currently, I do not have
the inventory to sell it.
And if I don't get
an investment from the sharks,
I don't know
if my company will survive.
Hey, y'all.
My name is Shelton Wilder,
and I'm really
excited to be here.
And the name
of my company is Shemie.
The Shemie.
I'm seeking an investment
of $60,000
for 20% of my business.
Okay. So when did we give
the slip, the slip?
I don't know.
But I am bringing it back,
but in a modern way.
This is not
your granny's slip.
No. Not like this.
Gross.
(chuckles)
My design is simple,
elegant, yet flirty,
and is an every day
wardrobe staple
for every woman
and every different body.
Now the reason
I came up with this
is because
I'm a fashion stylist.
I love fashion,
but way more importantly,
I love helping women
look and feel amazing.
That's my life.
I am wearing the scoop,
which I like to call
the "meet the parents."
So you're not showing
too much cleavage.
No! That is inappropriate.
Y'all know
that I am Southern.
Okay, next, the Shemie is
the perfect layering piece.
And Deborah has it
layered here with leggings.
Because remember, guys,
leggings aren't pants.
No, no, no.
That's rude.
Now Katie's wearing
this cute little dress,
but it's very short,
so she has on
the Shemie wrapper,
or more accurately called
"the paparazzi protector."
(laughter)
For the... (laughs)
For those nights out getting
in and out of the car
without any
wardrobe malfunctions.
Yeah, you know
who you are.
Okay, sharks, I need your help
to give to women
exactly what they've been
missing in their life--
the Shemie.
Now I have the passion
and the positron,
so who wants to swim
on This fun journey
with my Shemie and me?
The positron, huh? (laughs)
Whoo! Positron!
So, Shelton, it's not
a fashion piece?
It's something to wear
underneath other clothing?
Yes, it's a foundation piece,
but not a shaper.
If you are
a larger woman,
is this going to accentuate
your largeness,
or diminish it?
The point is, is that there's
so many shapers on the market--
Things that squeeze you,
fat dislocators.
But these are made
to be comfortable.
You know, it's not always you
wanna squeeze into something
and not feel great
in that.
Tell us your background,
Shelton.
You know, you said
you're a personal stylist.
I have been in fashion
since I was 16.
I was a buyer,
then a manager.
I ran
this amazing store...
Where were you a buyer at,
and where were you
a manager at?
At this store in Charlotte
called, uh, Capitol.
Like this blouse
is from there.
This was, like,
a $1,200 blouse.
How rude is it to go
and buy something like this
and then sell it
at your boutique
and not have an underpinning?
Incredibly rude.
And so I have been
at Nordstrom now.
And so it's like
I wanted to go
to all
the different markets...
you're in Nordstrom
with the product?
That's the exciting news.
I have been
a stylist at Nordstrom,
and I've developed
amazing relationships.
And they have the product
in Seattle right now,
and I have kind of
a verbal agreement
that we'll be
carrying it there.
A verbal agreement?
A verbal agreement.
I don't have
the signed paper.
But I just started
the company,
you know, I--six weeks ago.
Six weeks ago?
Do you have any sales?
Okay, with the sales,
I have ten stores
that have soft orders.
And then I also
have five other--
What's a soft order?
Meaning, like, they're
definitely placing the orders.
But--
so it's a long way
of saying you have no sales.
You're offering 20%
for $60,000
to any shark
that's interested.
That means you've valued
this business
at $300,000.
Hundred...
you've sold nothing.
Make a case,
because I don't want to tear you
to pieces on this,
but I may have to.
I am such a hustler.
Like, I don't think
you understand.
I know maybe I'm presenting
like Southern Belle.
No. I will get out there
on the streets.
Like, I will get
to stepping here.
And I love helping women
look and feel amazing.
So do I, every day.
Okay, good. Well,
then you need to help me here!
Come on!
Yeah, but my problem is
the valuation's insane.
You have no sales.
You have no sales that have
generated any profits.
Look...
(sighs)
It's just that to tell me
it's worth $300,000 today
is problematic
because I'm a disciplined
financial investor.
I want some evidence
that I'm gonna make money.
Okay.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Did you sell any
to all those customers
that needed something
that was right?
Absolutely. They're so excited.
They want this product again.
They're like, "I've gotta
have more of these."
So technically,
you have sold some.
How many have you sold that you
were just making on the side?
Oh.
Well, recently? I mean...
like, but--I had had some
with a--That were similar
in my company
that I worked with before.
And so I just--I just--
What do you mean you w--
You--You had a company
you owned before?
Company that I worked with
before.
You worked with somebody
who made this type of item?
This--This is my--This is
my design all--All along.
So you stole this--
But they were making
and selling it?
I'm lost here.
Yes.
You came up with the idea here?
There was a similar company
that I had with my best friend.
So you knocked off your former
company for your design?
No. No.
(Robert) You gotta--You--
We're all...
we're totally lost.
I know. I know.
Reboot.
How much did you sell
of the similar product
together in that company?
$150,000 in 18 months.
Like, we were selling
everywhere.
And why did it stop?
So as we're all asking you,
"what have your sale been?"
technically, you could've said,
"$150,000 in the last 2 years."
Okay.
Yeah, what happened
to that company?
Why'd you stop?
Why did you stop?
Well..
she had a family emergency
and she moved home.
Her--Her father passed away.
So--
But why didn't you continue
the business?
Because you must've built
some brand equity.
Right.
Couldn't you continue
under that name?
I-I couldn't continue under
that name because I was--
I didn't have the capital
to do so.
(Lori) If a company's successful
and you have a partner,
just because a family member
passes away,
it doesn't mean you shut down
the whole company.
You had all these people
that loved it
and everybody wanted it.
I think all of us up here
are struggling a little bit...
(Robert) Yeah.
With understanding why,
if it was
a successful business...
(sighs deeply)
Should I say it? Okay.
You did a $150,000 worth,
why you would stop.
I mean, are you holding out
telling us something?
Well, I...
out with it.
Um, during that time...
(sighs) I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.
Shelton, here--Here's the part
that I'm--
I'm still
a little confused about.
Okay.
The hardest thing in business
to build is a name.
Mm-hmm.
You and your friend start
this business. It's successful.
What happened to that business?
I wanted a fresh start.
It wasn't great memories
for me.
Sheltini is an alcoholic
beverage... (laughs)
and I'm not one anymore.
That was the name
of the other company.
So it's kind of for me, that's
what--like, it was not good.
(sighs deeply)
That--That was it.
Did you go bankrupt?
I-I went bankrupt personally.
Here's what happens
in the Shark Tank--
The truth always comes out.
It's impossible to hide
in here.
I wasn't trying
to hide that.
Why didn't you just bring it
all out right up front?
Hi! My name
is Shelton Wilder.
I went bankrupt
and I went to rehab.
Like, I don't--
I don't understand.
Might've worked better for you
because we understand hardship
and we understand
people getting back up.
And in some ways,
investing in somebody
that's tasted that sting
is better than one
that never has.
Shelton, I think Kevin's
out of line. I--
No, he's not.
This is business,
and the truth always comes out.
Kevin's out of line.
What's happened to you
in your personal life,
that--Those are your challenges.
Okay, so you've had this
ready to go in your mind,
but you just had to
get your act together...
yes.
Before you could
hit the ground running. Okay.
Absolutely.
(Daymond) So...
now that we've gotten
to the bottom of things,
as we usually do...
(laughs)
(Robert) Wow!
Uhh!
I feel--I feel like we just
went through the 12 steps.
No, I-I-I love it.
No, you understand
what the problem was.
I appreciate your time
and respect you guys so much.
Like, it's huge. I mean,
it's an honor to be here.
(voice breaks) Sorry. I just...
I'm really excited...
(sighs) because...
I've worked really hard
to get back to this.
And, um, gosh, I believe
in this product so much.
I could--I could not
get dressed without it.
I literally couldn't.
And that's the passion
that I have for this
that I will bring
to every woman across America.
I believe in this so much.
Like, this is my baby.
Shelton, we all appreciate
your passion.
Yeah.
And I think everybody here
would commend you
for picking yourself up in life
and starting again.
'cause that's what life
is all about.
Would you wear one?
Do you feel like--
I would.
Do you feel like it's a--
something that's kind of missing
out there in the market?
I like it and I think that
there is a need for it.
I think
the biggest problem is
there are so many things
out there that are similar.
They might not
be exactly like yours.
If you just keep doing
what you've been doing,
put all that great drive
into getting this out there,
you will make it
without any of us.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
You know, as Lori says,
everybody deserves
a second chance.
I have absolutely no problem
with your background.
Putting that aside,
my challenge is,
you've been doing it
for six weeks.
It's just too early.
I wish you all the best
of success in life.
Today, I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I--You know, I'm not big
into women's fashion.
Mm-Hmm.
Um, but it's easy to see
that it has a lot of potential.
So I wish I could help you
but I can't,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
I think your passion is
amazing.
I think that you--You went
through some challenging times
and you're gonna
even be better now
because you know
what you faced, right?
Yeah.
Six weeks of business
and valuing the company
at $300,000
in an area of fashion
that I don't know...
unfortunately, I'm out.
Well, thank you, guys,
for your time today.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you. Good luck.
(Mark) Thanks, Shelton.
(Daymond) Good luck.
(Robert) Wow.
We did go on a journey
with her.
(Kevin) to nowhere.
I am who I am,
and I have no secrets.
I think these challenges
are gonna be, like,
the biggest assets for me, so...
I feel really grateful
for the experience
and I'm excited
to keep moving forward.
