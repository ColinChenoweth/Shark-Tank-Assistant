It doesn't matter. Ask--
It does matter!
Connections are everything in--
'cause you can take--
You can take--
You keep 25% of this business,
which may sell
10 million of these,
and you keep it
all for yourself.
(Lori) but you're gonna
be keeping nothing
because he doesn't know how
to get this out there...
you mean,
"you haven't had any success."
Fast and market it correctly.
"you're an idiot.
You don't know what to do."
I know what to do.
Exactly!
(Daymond) I just did
a half-a-billion-dollar deal
with Walmart.
Half a billion.
So I understand retail.
But that doesn't mean anything.
What product is it?
Okay, I-I'd like to review
the offers. They keep changing.
Wait a second. Let the sponge
speak! and it's saying...
Lori.
"Go with Kevin."
I'm Meg...
and I'm Matt.
And we live
in Denver, Colorado,
with our family.
Let's go.
(barks)
Give me a high five.
We call Quimby "the bear"
Because he growls
like a bear.
(growls)
And we call Laika
"the rat,"
because he has
an unfortunate name.
He's a rat terrier.
(Matt) Come on, guys.
Let's go outside.
(thud)
(laughs)
We don't have children yet,
so the bear and the rat
are very much
like our children.
We do everything
with them.
We go on walks, we take
them on car rides,
eat with them,
sleep with them.
They're a huge inspiration
for why we started
our company.
After sharing
a treat with our dogs,
we noticed that they would
usually get sick.
So we wanted to make something
that was not only fun
but beneficial
to their digestion, as well.
And unlike anything
that's on the market.
Who wants treats?
Come here!
There's a huge market
of pet lovers
looking for the best
for their best friends with fur.
Is that good stuff?
Is that delicious?
We know we have
an awesome product
that millions of dog Lovers
would love to get
their hands on,
and we need the sharks' help
to get it out there
to those people.
Oh. Ho ho ho ho ho! Aw!
Aw.
That is the cutest dog
I've ever seen.
Why is it every dog
is the cutest dog
you've ever seen, Robert?
Hi, my name
is Meg Meyer,
and this is
my husband Matt.
And this is Quimby,
a.K.A. "the bear,"
and Laika,
a.K.A. "the rat."
And we are the bear &amp; the rat
cool treats for dogs.
We're seeking $125,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in our company.
Ice cream is not usually good
for dogs.
It upsets their stomach,
and the milk and sugar
is too rich for them.
I wanted to come up
with a treat
that was not only beneficial
to their digestion,
it actually supported
their immune system.
People are forming very special,
strong bonds with their animals.
I've had the bear
for 14 years.
So if I'm enjoying
an ice cream treat,
he's gonna enjoy
an ice cream treat.
Dogs love our fro-Yo.
But don't take our word
for it.
Take their word for it.
(chuckles) Our introductory line
comes in Three awesome flavors--
(laughing)
We have our
bacon peanut barker,
our banana peanut barker,
and our choc 'o' not.
Now more than ever,
consumers are looking
for natural,
healthful treats
for their dogs.
We're certain that
an investment from the sharks
would not only strengthen
our business financially,
but we're also super-excited
about the expertise
you would bring to the company
to make the bear &amp; rat
unstoppable.
Now who has questions?
I have a question, Meg.
I'm sure you do.
(laughter)
Uh-Oh. Get--Get ready.
No, no. I'm being pragmatic.
The money.
You're building a brand
around the bear and the rat.
Yes.
The bear is 14.
He is.
He's gonna be snuff city
in 24 months.
Do you have
another bear backup?
We--we love the bear.
It'll be part
of our story,
and part of his legacy,
and--and we'll
figure that out.
So it's like ice cream?
It--It's...
it is human grade.
So would you like to try it?
No.
(laughter)
bacon peanut?
That's our carob flavor.
That's fat-Free.
Banana? You think
I should go bananas?
I think you
should go banana.
(laughter)
Perfect.
So they have
no added sugar whatsoever.
(chuckles) don't do it.
Don't do it. Don't.
So it's not like ice cream
that you're gonna expect.
It's Bland,
but it's just enough flavor
to get their tail wagging.
Come on. It's not that bad.
It has natural
banana sugar in there.
Oh, my god.
(laughs)
Oh, he tried the bacon!
(laughter)
Was it good?
Ohh!
That was awful.
So guys, let me get
down to this.
Yes.
You know, I'm the one
that sits up here
between the bear
and the rat...
(laughter)
And I want to ask,
do you have distribution
right now?
Yes.
It's regional, so...
regional.
We're from colorado.
We've been on the--the market
for a little over a year.
(laughs)
In four months
after we launched our product,
we were on the shelves
of colorado whole foods markets.
So we are just regional
in the Rocky mountain
for whole foods.
One of the really cool things
that happened to us
several months ago is petco
called us out of the blue.
They wanted us to fill their 44
unleashed by petco stores.
And...
it's all-natural
nonfat yogurt in it.
And it has
organic peanut butter...
(laughs)
Organic bananas,
and the bacon is actually
nitrate-free bacon.
(drumroll)
(Daymond) don't drop the dog,
Robert!
(cymbal crashes)
(laughter)
Oh, my god!
Forget 24 months.
Robert's killing the rat!
(laughter)
It's okay, Buddy.
It's okay.
We need another dog! (laughs)
Come here, Buddy.
He's very athletic,
thankfully.
(growls)
I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't growl. It's okay.
He's gonna have to
make an offer now.
All right. So let's
get back to business.
Let's get back to it, yeah.
Let me walk you through
the potential here.
We've made--in a little
over a year,
we're at $30,000 in sales.
Yes, I know that's not
an astronomical number.
We did go to the largest
natural trade show
Early This year.
Had an excellent response.
Did you get orders
at that show?
No orders. No orders.
But we did
cultivate relationships.
That's not good.
Well, I know. The thing is,
with a frozen product,
it takes a little bit
more time
to grow
that distribution network
and to make sure--
Is that an excuse
for no sales?
"It takes a little bit
more time"?
it's tougher than that,
because there's Only--
There's Only so much
freezer space...
This is True.
In--In any location.
They fight over it.
This is True.
And they fight.
So how do you overcome that?
People look at our packaging
and become overjoyed by it.
Nobody looks at packaging
and becomes overjoyed!
(laughs)
I don't know.
I'm pretty happy
when I look at that package.
(Kevin)
So, Megan and Matt, if you know
that you're coming
into the Shark Tank,
and you're gonna put
a value of $625,000
on a business
that does $30,000...
yes.
Did I hear the answer
of why you felt
it was worth that much?
Um, okay. So... goodwill.
Goodwill, uh, valuation.
(laughter)
I know. I know.
Forget it.
Just goodwill.
Megan, how do you think
it's going in the Shark Tank?
(laughter)
When all the investors
are laughing,
that's not good.
And it's a fun product.
It really is.
Guys, let's speed this up.
Why don't you tell me
what I'm gonna say next?
You're out.
Thank you.
Your valuation
is 21 times sales.
Right, right.
Even the rat's unhappy
with that.
(laughter)
Oh, no.
He's quite happy.
He's out.
So what's the reason
you would ask so much?
We work with, um,
an advisor.
He's a director of operations
at a natural foods company.
But he's not
writing a check.
I know.
People love their dogs.
I mean, they will go
to the ends of the earth.
I mean,
myself and Meg included.
You know,
there's a piece of advice
that I like
to relay to entrepreneurs.
Yes.
Never take advice
from somebody who doesn't have
to live with the consequences.
Right. Right.
Right.
You guys do,
and the consequences
of misvaluing your company
coming into the Shark Tank
is that amount.
Right.
Well, we're willing
to negotiate the...
(laughter)
the category,
to me, is too small.
I don't think
it's investable.
I'm out.
Well, I love both of you.
I mean, I think
you are a fantastic couple.
I know there's a market
for treats for dogs.
Just give it
a little bit of time.
Keep thinking. Keep pushing.
I think you'll make it.
But for me
as an investment,
I'm out.
Matt, you know,
you do have great packaging.
I love the name
the bear &amp; the rat.
I mean, it makes me laugh.
I can't say it
without laughing.
I think you guys
are good operators.
I love the whole shtick.
Love the dog.
(Matt and Meg laugh)
I can't get beyond the value.
I'm out.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hey, Matt,
before you go,
can you get Laika
to do a trick?
Of course.
Little high five.
High five.
(laughter)
There you go.
There you go.
Thanks again.
Thanks, guys.
(Matt) Thank you.
(Lori) Thank you.
Robert, it looked like you were
chasing a greased pig.
Poor little dog.
What the hell
were you doing, Robert?
(laughs) Like this...
come here.
You know what?
I was so tired
of the four of you,
I thought the dog
would enjoy some company.
