First into the tank
is ginelle mills,
who set out to solve
a problem she faced as a mom.
Hi. I'm ginelle.
I am the owner of cool wazoo.
I'm here seeking $65,000
in exchange for 25% equity
in my company.
When my daughter
was Younger,
she was burned
on a park swing.
And I looked everywhere
for a product
that would protect her
from the heat of the swing,
and I couldn't find one.
So that's when I decided
to create one.
This was my diaper bag
at the time.
It was overstuffed
with all these products.
I was carrying around this
bulky shopping cart cover,
this restaurant
high chair cover,
this car shade,
and this way-Too-Small
changing pad.
I couldn't fit another
product in this diaper bag.
I couldn't even fit the diapers,
and it was a diaper bag.
And then I had an "Aha!"
moment.
What if I took
all these products
and made them
into one product
and incorporated my swing idea
into that same product?
Wouldn't that be cool?
(laughs)
Well, here it is.
It's called cool wazoo.
This is the first cover
with core material
on the inside
that redirects that heat
back to its source,
and it does five things.
It is the swing cover,
the restaurant high chair
cover,
the shopping cart cover,
and a car shade,
and... a changing pad.
I'm looking for a shark
who wants to make money
while making lives easier
and safer
for moms and children
everywhere.
Who wants to be cool with me?
Ginelle, 35 years ago,
when I was 5 years old...
(laughter)
I didn't have any of this crap,
and I somehow survived.
Who's buying all this junk?
Moms buy this stuff.
They're concerned
about the germs,
and now, as my daughter was,
I was concerned about the heat.
So that's why I meshed
the two together.
Why don't you show him
your packaging?
(mark) Now, ginelle, there's
other competitors, right?
Because I know my wife
has used other products.
(Robert) There is?
These are some
of my competitors.
There's not one product
that does five things.
When my daughter was burned,
it was 80 degrees outside.
What were you doing?
Swinging her on the swing.
I put her on.
It was 80 degrees--
Wasn't she howling
at the moon?
No--Well, you put her down.
(imitates babbling)
You know?
I'm like, "ugh.
Just swing," you know?
Just like--
(sharks laughing)
I mean, something like that.
I mean... (laughs)
You see smoke coming up,
she's on fire.
(Robert) Wow.
(speaks indistinctly)
I bought online
one of those laser guns
that measure--
You shot her?
(laughter)
That measures the surface
temperat--
I know what you're
talking about.
That measures surface
temperatures, yes.
You--You direct it, and it
tells you the temp.
So you're now shooting the seat
with a laser
to get the temperature.
Yes, because I couldn't
believe it was that hot.
I can't believe you go from
that to buying a laser gun.
Yeah, because I felt bad.
I had a little bit of luck
back last may.
The product
was on the "today" show
With Kathie Lee and hoda.
And it was on for about
40-Second airtime--
How many did you sell
from those 40 seconds?
Well, I didn't have
any inventory.
So, online,
did you take orders
even though
you didn't have inventory?
I'd rolled into production,
the "today" show hit,
and when I got
those orders back,
85% of those cool wazoos
were wrong.
That first run that I did,
85% of it
went back to the factory
because they didn't
really know
how to work with
this kind of material.
Did they refund your money
when you returned it?
They didn't refund the money.
(Lori) But how many people
ordered, anyway?
About $14,000 in sales.
What happened after that?
Well, I didn't really know
how to capitalize on that.
This past december, I was
on the show "the doctors,"
and it was
a christmas special.
Wow!
The first time,
she wasn't in a position
to take advantage of it.
I'm sure when you were going
on "the doctors," you said,
"I don't want this
to happen again."
What happened?
Good point.
Well, I was kind of
out of money at that point.
They wanted to give
everyone in the audience
250 cool wazoos,
so that's where
my inventory went.
I basically gave it away.
For free?
For free.
And what'd you get back
in return?
Nothing, because the format
of the show kind of...
wow.
Changed a little bit
at the last minute.
That's not a great
business decision.
(Kevin) You know what?
I know. That's--
That was a bad--
You got cool wa-Screwed.
What are your sales?
In the last 12 months,
my sales have been $20,000,
but I have had
zero inventory.
My efforts right now
have not been on sales,
because I'm moving
my production overseas,
because it's costing me too much
money to make them here.
How much is it costing you
to make them here?
It's costing me--
Hold your breath.
$30 to make one.
Wow.
(gasps loudly)
Ginelle, you're on a--
You're on a wonderful journey.
Really?
You're... (laughs)
Journey to where?
You're saving babies' behinds.
You've lost $100,000.
You have
a very supporting partner.
But it's--It's a long road.
I'm not sure that I want
to join you.
On the wonderful journey?
Uh, it's not for me.
I'm out.
ginelle,
I'm gonna come back in.
I really like you.
(sniffles)
And I really believe in you.
And I can see that
you're gonna put your heart
and soul into this.
And I'll give you
the $65,000
for a 25% stake.
And I will help you
to get the price down
and to manufacture
this better.
Wow, I would have
taken 50%.
No. That's it.
That's it. What do you say?
Say "Yes" Before--
Yes, of course. Yes!
(laughing)
Ah!
(laughing)
Thank you so much.
We'll make it work.
(laughs) Thank--
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Ginelle, great job.
(daymond) Ginelle,
you are deadly.
Your smile gets your husband
and your tears get Lori.
(laughs)
I'll tell you. Amazing.
Congrats, ginelle.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
(Kevin) What's the difference
between her
and the 100,000 entrepreneurs
that'll cry
if you ask them how hard
they've worked?
Lori, did you invest in her
because she cried?
No, it wasn't because
she cried.
This cannot become--
It was because she showed
such extreme passion for this.
I liked who she was,
and I also think
it's a good product, and I--
why didn't you get 51%
and get control?
Her journey's
all over the map.
I am not always about
taking control of things.
Let me run out there
and fix it for you.
(laughs) No, I don't want you
to run out there
and fix it for me.
She'd love to see me.
I've worked so hard for this,
and now that I've got
this deal,
I can see what I need
to do next,
and I'm gonna work
even Harder.
'cause I'm not gonna
disappoint Lori.
In season 3, we watched
Barbara lampugnale
make a deal with Lori Greiner
for her multi-Functional
nail polish, nail Pak.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Let's see what they're
up to now.
