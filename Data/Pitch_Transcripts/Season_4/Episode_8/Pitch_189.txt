Hello, sharks.
My name is Michael tseng,
and my product is called
platetopper.
I'm seeking $90,000
in exchange
for 5% of my company.
Millions of households
already use
plastic containers
and plastic wrap,
but there are huge problems
with these products.
Plastic lids and containers
always go missing.
Saran wrap
is an inconvenient mess.
Platetopper transforms
your plates at home
into airtight
Food storage containers.
Here's how it works.
Simply grab the handle
and press down.
And the airtight Seal
is so strong...
(Kevin) Oh.
You can suspend a plate
in midair.
It works on circular plates,
grandma's favorite China,
even your kitchen counter.
To release the Seal,
lift the pull tab,
and your food is ready
to serve.
Platetopper
is microwave-Safe,
to prevent messy splattering
and to keep food warm.
And cleanup is a breeze,
because platetopper
is dishwasher-safe.
And watch this.
You can finally organize
your kitchen cabinets
at home,
because platetoppers
nest neatly
for efficient storage.
But wait. There's more.
(laughter)
Sharks, if you invest
right now,
I'll throw in Three
New Sizes absolutely free.
(Lori laughs)
The platetopper mini...
(Kevin) Wow.
The platetopper tall...
(Kevin) Ooh.
(daymond) ahh!
And the famous cake topper.
Ahh!
Wow!
Sharks, I need your help
to fill
massive purchase orders
from two of the world's
largest retailers.
Join me,
and let's make platetopper
into a household brand
right now.
Sharks, here are
the platetoppers.
Thanks, Michael.
Absolutely.
Lori.
Thank you.
Wow!
Kevin.
Isn't that amazing?
Comes off so easy.
(Lori) So what are these
major retailers that you're in?
You might as well jump
right to that.
Uh, the product has been
on qvc since March,
and it's still on,
and on walmart's Web site
since may.
So no actual retailers
in the store?
This has been just only
on web sites?
Correct.
This is such a good idea.
Thank you.
It's by far the most elegant way
to cover food,
as opposed to covering it
with a disposable...
(Kevin) Oh, I hate that.
I'm always ripping it.
Trash product.
Mike, you--
(Robert) Michael, how did you
come up with it?
I came up with the product
over seven years ago
when I was at home from college
over holiday break.
I was doing a lot of work
in the kitchen
and just envisioned
a suction plate dome.
And eventually I combined that
with a microwave plate cover
and created the platetopper
you see today.
So you had
no engineering background
or product background?
Well, I did just come up
with the idea randomly,
but I studied electrical
engineering in college
at princeton university.
Oh. A princeton guy.
And then I went on
to study
biomedical engineering,
and last year I graduated
from medical school
from U.C.S.F.
And, Mr. Wonderful, feel free
to call me Dr. Platetopper.
(sharks laugh)
Are you a doctor, Michael?
I'm a doctor on paper.
I'm not a practicing physician
right now,
because I've taken
the last year off
to completely dedicate myself
to launching
the platetopper product line.
I see there's a patent there.
Yes. There's
a utility patent here.
Under your best case scenario,
in the next 12 months,
how much can you sell?
So right now, uh,
purchase orders
Have totaled over $1 million.
That's over four months.
Of that, I get paid wholesale
$500,000.
Michael,
I like what you're doing.
Okay.
And I think what you need
is a financier.
Absolutely.
Because, you know,
when I talk about
owning 5% equity
in a business,
I don't even get up
in the morning for that.
It's irrelevant.
Mm-hmm. Right.
So I'm not interested
in your equity,
but I am interested in you.
I'm gonna reverse your deal.
I'm gonna say, you want
$90,000? You've got it.
Okay.
Pay me a 5% royalty.
And you keep 100%
of what you own
for the big score
when you sell this
to a major player one day.
I totally love this product.
I'll even get on qvc and say
it's great on my chicken.
So, Mike--
Okay. Well, thank you,
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you for that offer.
It is an offer on the table,
and I will consider it
as I listen to other offers.
Excellent.
Great answer.
What I love about you
is you're very, very smart.
Um, you know, you're slick.
Also, I think
a little obnoxious.
Wait, there's more.
You're a little greedy,
and I can't wait
to be your partner.
What was your strategy
coming here
offering us 5% for $90,000?
I mean, you know, obviously,
that's--That's crap, right?
I know th--I--
the relatively low portion
of the equity
is because I want to retain
as much of the company
as possible, obviously.
All roads lead to Mr. Wonderful
in that scenario.
How many did you sell
your first time on qvc?
How many units?
It was 6,080 single units.
But what I'd--
what I'd like to say is
on qvc, they did
an initial test run
with $60,000 worth of retail.
(daymond) Mm-hmm.
A few months later,
they ordered
$1 million worth
of retail goods.
So... the same possibility
exists with walmart.
So I think we've established
this guy's the real deal, right?
(Lori) Here's my offer.
I'd like to take
the $90,000
and add a zero to it.
Yes. (exhales deeply)
So now we're at $900,000--
Offer.
Yes.
Ooh.
(daymond) All right.
Lori has offered Michael
10 times more money
than he asked for.
So now we're at $900,000--
Offer.
Yes.
(Robert) Ooh.
(daymond) All right.
For 30%.
I would like us to do
our own infomercial rollout.
Mm-hmm.
And I have all the connections
to all of the top retailers
around the world.
Michael, she's giving you
a $3 million valuation,
all right?
That is a phenomenal offer,
but what I'm curious is--
I know it's going to take
more than $900,000.
What is the financing like
on the back end?
As it's working,
I'll keep funding.
(daymond) Here's why
Lori's not necessarily
the right partner for you,
because you already are on qvc.
We're not even talking about
getting on qvc, daymond.
If you didn't have that...
Mm-Hmm.
Then I can see that she's
giving you something else
that we may not be able
to do...
Yeah.
Because she has an immediate--
Turn the switch.
Mm-hmm.
But... you're there.
(Lori) That's all fine,
daymond,
but he has an offer
on the table right now...
I know it.
From me for $900,000.
And he has a second one
for $1 million for 25%, Lori.
Pardon me?
Oh. Silence.
Well--
He has a second offer
for $1 million for 25%.
Bang!
(Lori) But he doesn't have...
okay.
Any of the connections
or the pipeline
or the factories
or all the things...
Mm-Hmm.
That I'm offering you.
What is she--
What is she talking about?
And I've offered you more,
because I said we'd start
with $900,000.
I offered $1 million.
You know, I started
exactly like you.
I'm just you 17 years later
with all those connections.
I think you know I'm
the right partner for you...
Mm-Hmm.
Because I know how to do
exactly what you want to do.
Bull crap. You know,
Lori's great at what she does,
but she thinks she's great at
everything every one of us does.
Um...
(laughs) Don't listen
to the little noise over there.
(Kevin) Let's just look
at these two offers--
$900,000 for 30%.
Right.
$1 million for 25%.
But of them, you understand,
steals your equity.
Okay.
Because This is gonna be
worth a fortune one day,
and you gave up.
Michael, are you seriously
considering Kevin's offer?
Kevin, right now, based on
these excellent offers
on the table, I'm gonna
respectfully decline your offer.
(Robert) Thank you.
You want to give up equity?
Bam!
Shut up, Kevin.
So right now I just want to
get to the valuation.
I do have a valuation in mind
that's, uh,
a little bit different than
the one I stated initially.
My product--
It's gone from $60,000
to $1 million in retail sales
in a few months.
And it's been proven
on qvc--
Yes, but there's 4,000 other
products that went to zero.
I'm just saying,
there's obviously utility
for every single household
in America
that has circular plates.
But I'll tell you one--
Let him finish.
Let him finish.
I'm saying
that my valuation--
I want it to reflect
the potential.
Are you gonna put
a number out there, Mike?
Yeah, but, Mike, because--
Michael, you were gonna get
to a number, weren't you?
I-I'm saying these other
products grow
to $100 million products.
Okay. Guys--
(Robert) No, but, Michael,
you must have a number in mind.
What's your number?
I'm getting irritated.
It's a little slippery to me,
the way you're acting.
S--
'cause, listen,
you got a number, man.
Yeah.
Let's not play games.
Daymond,
I'm--I'm honestly not
trying to be slick or Sly--
Just get to the number, man.
Say it then.
I'm not trying to be
slick or Sly.
I'm just letting everybody
field their offer before--
Okay, you have one offer
for $900,000.
Before I--
just say the number, man.
If I were
a used car salesman,
I wouldn't say,
"here's the lowest I'll go."
I would negotiate.
Michael, I don't disagree
with your strategy.
I'm not being--
I'm not trying to be negative.
If I know one thing,
it's to say less
than it is to say more.
So I am not gonna disclose
what my magic number is.
All right, Mike,
you know what?
You're starting to rub me
the wrong way. I'm out.
(Robert) WHOA!
Whoa!
It's a slick Willie thing.
You know, dancing around--
"Well, maybe. Hold on.
I'm say--"
So, daym--
I-I'm out. You don't need
to speak to me anymore.
I--
(Kevin) Well,
that's interesting, Mike.
So I'll speak
to Mr. Wonderful,
and may--And daymond
might overhear me.
So I really appreciated
daymond's offer
of $1 million for 25%.
Listen.
My gut Feeling is saying
This would not be a great
partnership for you and I.
Hmm.
Because I practice business
another way, all right?
Okay.
So I should shut up,
because I'm not in this anymore.
Uh, so--Uh, daymond, I'm--
(Kevin) Y-You know why you're
running into trouble here?
You came with a valuation
of $1.8 million.
Yeah.
And then you're not
honoring it anymore.
(Robert) he's negotiating.
I-I'm field--
I'm fielding these offers.
(Kevin) You have
three sharks left.
You have reduced
your probability of success
by at least two out of five.
You better get focused
on the other sharks
that are still in the deal.
I want to hear
from the other sharks.
And, Lori, I--
your offer's great,
so we're gonna talk about it.
You know,
I'm gonna step back.
Are you taking your offer
off the table, Lori?
I'm curious just to say,
what if I rolled it back?
What if I went back
to the $90,000
for the 5%
as you walked in?
Seems to me like you're
more comfortable with that.
So, Michael, let me tell you
what's happening now.
You had an offer.
(laughing)
No, it's nothing
to laugh about, my friend.
Okay.
You're losing offers.
You're losing money.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
You're losing!
When are you gonna shut up
and take an offer?
(Robert) Here's where I'm at.
For me, the risk is
the product doesn't sell.
(snaps fingers)
$1 million gone.
(snaps fingers)
$500,000 gone.
All of a sudden,
you're into negative cash.
That's my worry.
Are you gonna make
an offer, Robert?
Michael,
I-I can't help you
with the retail part.
Okay.
Um...
uh, so, in terms--
Before you--before--
I'm out.
You do realize you haven't
even given
the remaining two sharks
your valuation yet?
I mean, at this point, you gotta
stop playing the games.
What is the number?
I-I'm simply waiting for
offers to be on the table.
All right. I'm gonna go
to the bathroom, man...
if you keep waiting...
or something, you know?
They keep getting smaller.
That's what's actually
happening here.
You only have two sharks left.
I'm gonna--
I'll give--I'll put out--
I'll throw out a number.
You guys have pushed me.
Okay.
Um, I'll--I'll describe
the offer
that I was originally
going to make,
which was $750,000
in exchange for 5%
of the company.
Here we go with this crap.
And that's a valuation
of $15 million.
Wait a minute.
You asked for $90,000 for 5%.
Now you've changed it
to $750,000?
I haven't changed it.
I've said that was
what I was originally gonna
come into the tank with.
Why did you come in
with $90,000 for 5%?
Switch and bait.
Why are you doing that? Why?
I'm not--
We actually may watch a guy
with a fantastic business
walk out of here
with nothing pretty soon.
Potentially the best product
we've ever seen.
Okay, Michael, what's happened
here in the "shark tank"
is rather remarkable.
You had a $900,000 offer
for 30%.
That evaporated down
to $90,000 for 5%.
So you talked your way
out of that one Nicely.
Daymond offered you
$1 million,
and it went to zero, because you
meandered around here
like a shark that has
no direction.
So I think,
at the end of the day,
if you keep working this hard,
you'll leave with nothing.
I was gonna offer him
$1 million, too,
and he talked himself
out of that.
(Kevin) wow.
I think you better get focused,
because now you have
two sharks left.
Mr. Cuban hasn't spoken
what he wants to do.
Right.
Lori has actually diminished
her offer dramatically
'cause she got tired
of listening to you.
(laughs) That's not why.
I think it's True.
You went back and talked
to somebody.
What are you coming back
to tell us?
Uh, so I went and talked
to my Younger brother
and got his c.E.O.
To speak to me
about the value of, uh,
a line of credit.
$10 million is a number
that we discussed.
But what amount of cash
do you want today
for what percentage?
M-more what I want is
based on the valuation.
So the--
so you'll take $90,000--
What's the--
Let him talk.
Let him talk. Let him talk.
The valuation is $15 million.
So $1.5 million for 10%
of the company, for example.
Okay. There's what you really
wanted to come in
and ask for today.
Okay.
I just want to make sure
you guys are clear.
He wants
a $15 million valuation.
Okay, I'm out again.
(mark) It took a lot of work
to get you to that valuation.
$15 million, even with knowing
that there's a floor
of $1 million
in purchase orders,
is too high
for a consumer goods product.
Okay.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Uh, is there--
Whoa. Wow.
Wait, wait.
So what's the value
that you have in mind
for the company right now?
Nowhere near $15 million,
because--
I know.
I'm happy to hear
what it is, though.
(Robert) Michael.
It doesn't matter, Michael.
I don't want--
Michael, he's out.
Lori's still in.
I'm--I'm still--
Michael, what I tried to do--
I'm still willing
to negotiate.
I understand, Michael,
but we did negotiate.
I gave you
the benefit of the doubt,
and we went through
a whole dance,
a whole negotiation.
Right.
And with that still,
you came to $15 million.
We were talking about details
that, to me,
are--Are very important
for structuring the deal,
but we weren't talking numbers,
and I--
But the most important detail
now is he's out.
So talk to Lori.
I was just--
I was just waiting--
I thought you were gonna
make an offer,
and I was just biding time.
And you were wrong, Michael.
You were wrong.
You're best to talk to Lori.
So, the--
mark, the one thing
I have for you is that the--
You're best to talk
to Lori, man.
There are 15--
Michael, what are you doing?
(indistinct arguing)
the guy said he was out.
(daymond) You have one last
person to talk to. Please.
You have--You have done
a remarkable thing.
You have convinced everybody
to rescind their offer
because you can't seem
to make a decision.
I do seem to be
the only one left here.
So you have your moment now
to convince me
why I should stay with you,
when you didn't realize that...
Mm-hmm. Right.
I was the right one for you.
My initial Strategy was simply
to field all the offers,
and I think because we got so
caught up in those discussions,
that I wasn't able to ask you
all the questions
that I wanted to originally.
Michael, what are you
doing with Lori's offer?
So what I'm asking
from you is,
in an "as seen on tv"
Campaign,
it requires buying
Inventory
before Those purchase orders
are in place.
No, actually, it doesn't.
But that's why I was
the right partner,
because I told you I know
all about what you need.
But still, the valuation...
I'm not pleased with.
Well, if we went back to
your original $90,000 for 5%...
Mm-Hmm?
What if I were to give you
$90,000 for 10%?
All of it's here for you.
It's all here.
Mm-hmm.
Perfectly.
Like, tied up in a bow.
I just tuned out
for a little bit because--
You tuned out?!
(daymond) He tuned you out,
Lori, for a little bit.
(laughs)
I just thought--I mean,
you're obviously the shark
and trying to take advantage
of the situation--
(daymond) No, you're not.
No, I'm not trying
to take advantage.
He just said
he tuned you out.
That's--No--
Not in a--
not in a disrespectful way.
Well, you--
Just a breather--
Yeah, take a breath.
Take a breath.
Ask yourself--
Michael, how do you say
something like that
respectfully?
I--
Ask yourself--
How is it going
in the "shark tank"
for you right now?
(laughs)
How's it going, Buddy?
Uh, far more intense
than I anticipated.
(Robert) Michael, you've played
this game for a long time now.
You know, you've been
disrespectful to Lori.
She's made you an offer.
What are you going to do?
Uh, I'd like to make
a counteroffer.
Why don't you talk to her?
All right. Absolutely.
Okay.
Lori, So, uh,
I would like to sign
an agreement
for a 5% equity stake.
So, if any of the sharks
would like to re-Enter
and make
a simple cash offer
for a 5% equity stake
so we can be--
the $90,000 at 5%?
So--No. I-I'm saying,
who will bid the highest?
(scoffs)
Michael, it doesn't work
that way!
(daymond) You are
playing games.
It doesn't work that way!
None of us are interested
except for Lori.
Are you gonna take
her offer or not?
Michael, I'm giving you
a lifeline
for the next--Literally--
Two seconds.
This is the last thing
I'm gonna offer you.
$90,000, 8%.
Take it or leave it.
(exhales deeply)
(exhales deeply)
time to make a decision,
Michael.
(clears throat)
(Lori) You should know
in your gut.
I-I'll do it.
You got a deal.
You got a deal.
All right. Good.
Wow.
Yeah, finally!
(all speaking at once)
Thank you. I'm really--
I am really happy
to have a deal done.
All right, good.
Good to hear.
Congratulations, Michael.
All right. Michael.
Thanks, guys. Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye.
I got a deal.
(groans)
I'm shocked
you stayed in it.
You know, I like
the product, guys.
I can't stand him.
Platetopper bozo.
(Lori) I did what I wanted
to do.
It's a good product.
(singsongy)
I'm gonna make it a hero!
