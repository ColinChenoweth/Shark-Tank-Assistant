My name is Bruce Gaither.
I live in Sylmar, california
with my wife and children.
Hello, folks.
My name is Bruce Gaither.
This is biscuit.
And my company
is no fly Cone.
I'm looking for an investment
of $25,000
for a 15% stake in my company.
Now, you've all heard
the saying,
"build a better mousetrap,
and the world
will beat a path
to your door."
Well, I've built
a better flytrap.
No fly Cone is a nontoxic,
Cone-Shaped flytrap
that catches them on the inside
so you don't have to see them.
The Cone is placed over
a natural attractant,
provided by biscuit.
Nothing works better.
It's a simple solution.
You take your flytrap,
your no fly Cone,
and you set it...
over a scooper.
Come back later, and you
see how well it works.
(Robert) EW!
(Lori laughs)
Now, the reason I came up
with This
is because my office
is the barn,
which is haunted with flies
because of the dogs
and the horses.
So, I designed
an all-Natural flytrap,
and right away,
we were successful,
catching them where they
feed and breed.
With your investment
and your connections,
we can make no fly Cone
the trusted standard
for controlling flies
in no time.
What questions do you have
for me?
How is that different
than, like,
a no-Pest strip
that you would hang?
Well, the strips
have an external glue.
Well, you see the flies
that they accumulate.
With this,
you don't see the flies
until you actually look
to see what you've caught.
It requires dog excrement
as the attractant.
(Robert) Is that True?
Yes, sir.
(daymond) So, the dog
has to defecate outside,
and you put the cap over this,
and that attracts the flies.
But if you clean up the dog's
mess and put it away...
You got it, daymond.
You--You're kind of
creating the problem
by leaving the poop outside,
aren't you?
When you pick up
your dog poop,
there's gonna be residue
on the grass,
and there's residue
in your scooper.
Does this attract other things
besides flies?
People catch mosquitoes
with it,
people catch gnats with it.
Um, there's a lot of different
uses for the trap.
Wh--
Lot of different applications.
Seth Macfarlane, baby.
Hey, you guys doing
a tv show?
No way!
How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.
Bruce, who is this guy?
This is, uh,
my Buddy Seth Macfarlane.
Welcome, Seth.
How's it going?
Creator of "Family guy"
over here.
(as stewie) You know,
I put a lot of money
into that landmark
theatre business.
Didn't do so well.
Oh, stewie, come on, man!
(laughter)
Oh, stewie!
Love that show.
(normal voice)
Thank you very much.
Seth, you look like you're
18 years old, for god sake.
You are so--Oh, god,
now I love it here.
(Lori laughs)
Seth, you weren't just
walking by.
(chuckles)
So, what brings you?
Uh, Bruce is
a friend of mine.
I actually take horseback
Riding lessons from Bruce.
And, you know, he--He showed me
how this thing works,
and, you know,
it's not just flies.
It's small children...
(laughter)
Uh, bad feelings.
It just--It attracts them all.
It's great. Yeah.
Seth saw me develop the trap.
Well, Bruce, you have
a very big fly right here
who can help you
with this situation.
(Lori laughs)
Why--Why do you need us?
I ha--
I'm not allowed to do
anything for abc.
(laughter)
If I ever write
a really funny cartoon,
I'm gonna hand it
to Seth and say, "here."
But right now I have, like,
five amazing people
in front of me
that can help me
get this on the market.
What are your sales
for the last year?
Only 3,000 traps.
Seth, uh, where do you live?
I-I don't like flies
in my house.
Do you use this
in your house?
What's my address?
I'm not gonna tell you
where I live.
(laughter)
But do you use these
in your house?
Yeah, I-I don't have a dog.
He's your spokesman,
and he doesn't even have a dog?
If I did, I'd be
the first guy in line.
What I'm not relating to is,
is that I have to have...
dog excrement
to make it work.
(Robert)
This is a qvc product.
I could see you on air
with the little dog poop
selling this.
(laughter)
They've sold worse crap
than this.
(laughter)
(Lori) Oh, come on!
Oh, boo! Bad!
You know, Bruce,
I'm with biscuit on this one.
He's--he's waiting
for something right now.
I don't know what it is.
(laughter)
He's--
I just have no interest
in it.
(Robert laughs)
I'm out.
Thank you, Kevin.
(as stewie) You're not
a very nice man.
(laughter)
They told me you were
not a nice man.
(laughing)
Bruce, I don't have
any connections
in this side of the world,
so I-I don't think
I'm the guy to help you,
so I'm out.
And it's because he picked on
landmark. I wouldn't never s--
thank you, mark.
(normal voice)
Oh, wow! See?
You're regretting
this already.
No--
So, Bruce,
two sharks are out.
Was it a good idea
to bring Seth or not?
(laughs)
Well, I'll tell you,
it was a lot more fun
than being out here
by myself, so Yeah.
Yeah. (laughs)
Hey, you know, I'll tell you,
the only reason I'm not out yet
is because you brought Seth.
Ugh. I, uh... (sighs)
I just don't even know if I can
help you even with Seth.
I'm out.
(mouths word)
Well, I'm not gonna hold
Seth against you.
This is a--such a warm,
inviting place.
(mark) Yeah.
(laughs)
What love is in this room.
(Lori) I commend you
for coming up with something.
You had a problem,
you created a solution,
and that's great.
The problem for me is,
is I can't get past
how it works.
It's a personal turn-off.
I--if it had another
type of attractant,
then it might be
more appealing.
Well, let's go
for chicken bones.
Chicken bones. (laughs)
I'm sorry. I'm out.
(Robert) I got to be honest
with you, Bruce.
I really can't add
a lot of value.
(imitating Boris karloff)
And the grinch's heart
grew Three sizes that night.
(laughs)
Bruce, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna be out.
Thank you, Robert.
I-I blame myself.
No, no.
You probably should.
This was my fault.
Yeah, Seth, we're all
blaming you.
You probably should, Seth.
This was my fault.
This was a terrible idea.
What a disaster.
No, it was wonderful.
Not really.
Thanks for coming out.
Thank you, folks.
Thank you very much.
All right, Seth,
pleasure, man.
(Robert) Pleasure, guys.
Gentlemen and lady.
Come on, biscuit.
(laughter)
Thanks for trying, Buddy.
I really appreciate it.
I didn't--I was--
I was no help to you.
It was actually a good idea.
Not really. So bad.
At one point, there was
a-a fly crawling
down the side
of Mr. Wonderful's face
as he was talking, and it
just kind of made its way
into his mouth, and--
Like the bad guy from
"raiders of the lost ark,"
and he didn't do anything.
He just sat there,
kept talking.
I don't know if it went
down his throat or what.
But clearly, not only
does he need this thing,
but I don't even think
he's human.
(laughs)
