First in is Drew Beaumier,
with his idea of the next
generation of costumes.
Oh, lord.
Are they people?
(whirring)
HA!
Ooh!
Hello, sharks.
My name is Drew Beaumier.
My product is drive suits,
Drew, can I see it? Can I--
absolutely.
(Barbara) Drew, how did you
come up with the idea?
Um, just basically I needed
to make my rent money,
But, Drew, isn't it time,
at this point,
to partner with
one of the big toy companies,
because so much of the challenge
you face is manufacturing,
which they have nailed down,
So, Drew, it's just
so soon for me,
because there's so many
mysteries right now
with how much it's gonna cost,
where you're gonna make it,
how you're gonna ship it.
I'm sorry, but I'm out.
Okay.
I'm very concerned about
the liability issue,
Look, Drew, two things
that are absolute.
Drew has two offers
on the table--
$150,000 for 40% of his company
from Mark Cuban.
Kevin's offer is $150,000
for 30%,
contingent on a deal
with a toy company.
(Kevin) Drew,
isn't it time at this point
to partner with one
of the big toy companies?
We'll either get a deal or not.
The beauty is,
I know how to negotiate it,
Look, Drew, the idea
of trying to sell
to toy manufacturers
is ridiculous.
You don't want it to go
to license to them.
You want to build buzz,
we put it online,
we create a big viral buzz,
You know, I'm not trying
to make friends, drew.
I'm trying to make money,
