I'm Beverly Vines-Haines.
And I'm Charlotte Clary,
and we're from
Yelm, Washington.
Whoo!
We've been friends
26 years.
And between the two of us,
we have...
(both) 37 grandkids.
You'd think 37 grandchildren
would keep us busy enough,
but while all our friends
are out
scrapbooking and quilting,
we've developed
a major business.
Hi. I'm Bev Vines-Haines.
And I'm Charlotte Clary,
and we're the founders
of Ice Chips candy.
We're asking for $250,000
in exchange for a 15% equity
in our company.
In the competitive
candy and mint world,
xylitol is the hottest
alternative sweetener going.
Ice chips are
the yummiest, healthiest
xylitol candy on the market.
Most sugar-free candy
and "healthy" candy
tastes like petrified flour.
But our candy comes
in 17 exciting flavors--
Zesty, stimulating,
and actually good
for adults and children.
It's true.
Xylitol is
a natural sweetener.
Germs and bacteria
cannot grow on it,
so dentists love it.
Life still hands out
plenty of surprises.
We thought by this time
we would be doing
grandma things
for our 37 grandchildren.
Thank you, Charlotte.
Thank you.
Kevin, Beverly says
she thinks
she used to babysit you.
(laughter)
Tastes great.
Mmm.
Doesn't taste sugar-Free.
(Robert) So, ladies,
xylitol is all natural?
It's not chemically made?
Absolutely natural.
Yes.
Hmm.
I've never seen
this type of candy.
Health food stores are
our primary source for sales.
Dentists sell them.
A lot of them sell them
in their offices.
We use American xylitol
made from the Birch bark
of the Birch tree.
Any downside
to that chemical?
It's something
I'm not familiar with.
Any side effect?
Only if you eat
the whole tin.
Yeah. Then there can be...
(laughs)
a little tummy distress--
If you ate the whole tin.
Tummy distress?
Wow. Charlotte,
that's fantastic.
Sales--
So we've almost doubled.
Oh, so you're halfway through.
Yes.
So you think you'll hit,
uh, $700,000 this year.
$700,000.
We actually think
we could hit
that million-Dollar mark
by the end of the year.
Those are some sweet numbers.
(both laugh)
What are you making it for
and what are you selling it for?
We make it right now
for $1.11 a tin.
It wholesales for
$3 and 12 1/2 cents a tin.
(Daymond) nice.
The average sale
in a store is $5.
Are you opening more accounts,
or are the same accounts
just increasing their orders?
Yes and Yes.
Nice.
We have about
ten new accounts--
10 to 12 new accounts
every week.
Why is it shaped like flakes?
The honest answer?
No, I want you to lie
to me, granny.
(both laugh)
Two grannies in a garage
couldn't press out
100,000 little pellets.
(Beverly) Yeah.
(Robert) Come on, seriously?
So you just hit it
with a hammer? Bang?
Serious.
Yep. Yes.
But they said
you couldn't make hard candy
from xylitol,
and we did what they said
couldn't be done.
And by pouring it
and then breaking it this way
and calling it ice chips,
everyone has loved it.
(laughs)
Tell me your background
before you became grannies.
Well,
I was a romance writer.
So probably not gonna
help you much.
(laughter)
I have a bachelor of science
degree in natural health.
(Daymond) There's other candies
in the market.
I-I just want to know
about your competitors.
Spry is our biggest competitor,
'cause dentists also do them.
But they have
a pressed candy, like...
what other pressed candy?
Like an altoid?
Maybe Altoids is pressed.
Yeah. And are these sold
only in, uh, mainly, uh,
health food stores,
or are they in 7-Elevens
and Walgreens and...
Well, that's distribution.
It's hard to get in.
We do have
a lot of grocery stores.
We're in grocery--
But there's a distributor
you want to sell to
that's gonna supply all them.
(Beverly and Charlotte) Yes.
(Daymond) So you guys--
You have everything.
You know, you know your market,
you know your numbers.
You're making money.
So why are you here?
Automation.
To bring our margin down
where we make this for 77 cents.
Basically want us
to buy you a machine
that's gonna cost
$250,000, right?
Yes.
Well--
$250,000--That's not even
$5,000 per grandchild.
Get those grandchildren
out there working.
That's true.
Get them to make
a few thousand bucks,
and you're good to go.
We are.
We have two of them
working there now.
(both laugh)
I'd like to make you
an offer.
What I like best
about the product
over all of the candy products
I've seen, dietary or not,
is I love the idea
that you have chips.
You can pick how big
or little a chip
you want to pop in your mouth.
I don't know why, but I love,
like, picking it out.
(laughing)
Like a choice.
(Mark) Yeah, you're right.
(Barbara) You know?
That's unique.
And I would just like
to go on a sales call with you,
just to see what you do.
You're a hoot.
(laughing)
So it would be three grandmas.
Whatever. No problem.
The full granny gang.
If you wanna call me
a grandma, no problem.
So I'm gonna give you
half the investment--$125,000.
But I'll have to have
more stock.
I would need 1/3 of the business
for that--33%.
Ohh! That's crazy.
For just your piece?
Yes, for just my piece.
So, Barbara,
they have to go out and raise
the other $125,000,
and get another 33%.
You're a vicious granny.
Beverly and Charlotte
have one partial offer
(Charlotte)
We so appreciate them all,
but we just really felt
the Barbara/Mark combination,
for our personality,
was probably gonna be the best.
Business-wise,
a different decision
might be good,
but personality-wise,
we will...
be happy.
Kill it together.
(laughs)
listen, I can go to bed
knowing I helped granny.
Talk about judging a book
by its cover.
They're hustlers.
This is something
that Barbara will enjoy.
They will love to get
on the phone with her
and hear her ramble about
her cockamamie stories
for, like, two weeks.
(laughs)
I loved the grandmas.
I love the gramas, too,
and I hate--UGH!
