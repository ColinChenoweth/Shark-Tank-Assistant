First in is Drew Beaumier,
with his idea of the next
generation of costumes.
Oh, lord.
Are they people?
(whirring)
HA!
Ooh!
Hello, sharks.
My name is Drew Beaumier.
My product is drive suits,
and I'm requesting $150,000
for 20% equity stake
in my company.
Drive suits are
the first generation
of wearable
recreational devices
and are unlike any other
product available
on the market today.
Their main attraction
is the function
to instantaneously
transform the user
from a human or walking state
to a vehicular
or motor-driven form.
(laughs)
Crazy.
Whether I'm
at a national convention
or simply testing a prototype
out on the street,
everyone stops,
and the first thing
they always ask me is,
"where can I get one?"
This leads me to believe
that the highest financial
payoff for my invention
exists in mass manufacturing
and distribution.
With your much-needed
investment
and equally needed and respected
business expertise,
I see absolutely no reason
why together
we can't mark a new standard
in children's entertainment
and create a product
that literally
drives off the shelves.
(whirring)
That's cool.
(laughs)
Thank you very much.
How fast does it go?
It goes about 10, uh,
maybe 12 miles an hour.
Drew, can I see it? Can I--
absolutely.
(Barbara) Drew, how did you
come up with the idea?
Um, just basically I needed
to make my rent money,
But, Drew, isn't it time,
at this point,
to partner with
one of the big toy companies,
because so much of the challenge
you face is manufacturing,
which they have nailed down,
and more importantly,
distribution?
What you're wearing
could probably be dumbed down
to a $99 price point,
I would hope,
and perhaps packaged in a way
that would fit on the shelves
of walmart.
If you had... a partner.
(Robert) But what's proprietary
about it, Kevin?
Like, he goes
to a toy company.
Wh-What's unique?
What can't they copy?
Basically, what I have to
bring to the table for them
is just the trial and error
over the past two years.
These are definitely not
the first prototypes.
So it's your experience?
Yes.
The best thing I have in place
is I have the trademark
for drive suits.
I have not been able
to afford a patent.
I had a provisional patent,
which expired,
but I didn't see it doing
much good.
So, Drew, it's just
so soon for me,
because there's so many
mysteries right now
with how much it's gonna cost,
where you're gonna make it,
how you're gonna ship it.
I'm sorry, but I'm out.
Okay.
I'm very concerned about
the liability issue,
because I have kids,
and seeing my kids
on the streets with this,
I think I'd be
sick with worry, honestly.
For that reason, I'm out.
Thank you.
Three sharks are out.
Mark and Kevin are
drew's last chance at a deal.
I like the business.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Using this $150,000,
we're gonna make
20 of these.
Okay.
And then we'll work
with costume designers
to create different looks.
And we'll go out
and we'll have some fun,
and we'll make it viral,
we'll put it online.
(groans)
We'll also hire
an engineer
to help you optimize
the design of this.
We'll see where we can take it
in terms of cost.
Then we'll make some
business decisions.
Because the key here,
you have to understand--
You're not a company yet.
(Daymond) So, Cuban wants you
to work for him
and suck your blood
for about three years...
(Barbara laughs)
Until maybe there's, uh...
that's true.
Some kind of commercial use,
and then he'll--
No, that's not--
That's so far from the truth.
As an elephant in a circus.
You might get a feed bag.
No. That's so far from
the truth, and you know it.
So if we can agree that
there's some uncertainty
and we'll learn as we go
and we'll make some
business decisions as we go,
then I'll offer you
$150,000 in cash
for 40% of the company.
Thank you very much
for your offer.
I don't like to think
small like that.
I don't want to put you
in a circus with a cattle prod
and keep blasting you.
(laughs)
I want to go big.
I think big.
Okay.
I would give you $150,000
for 30% of the company,
with one contingency--
I bring it to the toy company.
They're either gonna love it
or they're gonna hate it.
So the risk you've got
with my deal is,
they simply don't think
there's an opportunity for it.
You know, I sold my company
to a toy company.
I know all the toy company
C.E.O.S.
Look, Drew, two things
that are absolute.
One--With my deal,
you have cash in hand.
Period, end of story.
Two--there's no toy company
that won't take my call.
Question--is that
the right thing to do?
I mean, there's no question
mine's the better offer.
You're either gonna be
an elephant
or you're gonna be rich.
You have two paths.
What are you going to do?
Drew has two offers
on the table--
$150,000 for 40% of his company
from Mark Cuban.
Kevin's offer is $150,000
for 30%,
contingent on a deal
with a toy company.
(Kevin) Drew,
isn't it time at this point
to partner with one
of the big toy companies?
We'll either get a deal or not.
The beauty is,
I know how to negotiate it,
and you will either be
in a partnership
with a toy company right away,
or you won't be.
And you'll either be
very rich,
or you'll work for Mark
as an elephant.
Look, Drew, the idea
of trying to sell
to toy manufacturers
is ridiculous.
You don't want it to go
to license to them.
You want to build buzz,
we put it online,
we create a big viral buzz,
and we start building
a business that way.
It may not get as huge
right away,
But if it clicks...
(snaps fingers)
It could get real big.
You know, I'm not trying
to make friends, drew.
I'm trying to make money,
and I think you should
get in tune with that.
Be one with the dollar.
You guys don't make it easy,
do you? (laughs)
(sighs)
Welcome to the "Shark Tank."
I have no problem with
waiting something out
and building it slowly
and taking baby steps...
but I'm kind of a gambler.
Kevin, would you
work with me, please?
(Daymond laughing)
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
(Barbara)
God, what a mistake.
(Daymond) Oh!
That's great, my friend.
Let's try and make it happen.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
You lost to Mr. Wonderful!
(laughs)
(whirring)
He made the biggest mistake
of any entrepreneur
who's ever come in here.
He came out zero sum game.
Every entrepreneur has to
take a chance, Mark, and he did.
Say "cheese."
I'm taking a picture, man.
(camera shutter clicks)
And sharing it with the world.
Don't do that.
Ah, it's too late, baby.
I got my t-Mobile
super-Fast 4g.
Oh, yeah.
