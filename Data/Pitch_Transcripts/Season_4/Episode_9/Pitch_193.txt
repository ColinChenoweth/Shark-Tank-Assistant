Today, I'm seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Revestor's doing
for real estate
what the internet's done
for car buying
So, Bill, how do you predict
the value of a house
five years from now?
Well, our proprietary
algorithm
makes some assumptions,
but obviously
it's up to the user
to decide
what they believe--
(Robert) Tell me about
the proprietary algorithm
that you use.
Like, what criteria do you use
to come up with the best deal?
The--the patent
is submitted on the fact
I thought, Bill,
when you came out here

"the world has a huge problem.
"It's full of blood-sucking
real estate agents
do $100 million in revenue,
and be a billion-dollar company.
I've done this before.
I'm not a "wantrepreneur."
I've been around
the block before.
Okay, what did you do before?
I built a $20 million company
from scratch.
Bill, you're only gonna

Bill, you're talking out of
both sides of your mouth.
It's incredible.

Okay. Okay. Thank you.
So you're buying the data
from the two sources.
Right.
That gives you

the listings of all the houses
that are for sale,
plus another source that's
giving you the auction listings.
Well, Bill, I'm glad that Mark
explained it to me as well,
because if it was that hard
for you to explain it to me,
it's gonna be
that much harder
for you to explain
to customers,
Bill, you have
no business concept.
You talk out of
both sides of your mouth.
I'm gonna build this company
to a $100 million Company
right next to zillow.
(Robert) Bill, there's nothing
wrong with believing that.
But the presentation
you came up with today
made you appear like
a bit of a con artist.
I'm not a s--
I'm out.
You're getting your ass
kicked in here.
I-I know.
Bill, you gotta leave now
before it gets better.
Okay. Thank you. (laughs)
(laughs)
(Bill) I clearly blew it
out there. It was brutal.
It was like I walked
into a wood chipper.
