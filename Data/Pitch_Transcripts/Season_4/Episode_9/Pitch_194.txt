Diarrhea.
Ooh!
Ha!
You guys don't make it easy,
do you?
Welcome to the "Shark Tank."
and I just kind of had
this idea.
I saw a flier
for a costume contest.
Whoa. Don't like that.
You know what?
These guys are wasting time.
I call these guys hammerheads,
'cause they think
that everything that
walks in the door is a nail,
Hello, sharks.
My name is David A. Cox.
It's--It's the "Mona Lisa."
(laughs)
Well, there's one tiny flaw.
There's a zit.
It's not a tiny zit.
It's Mount St. Zit.
Oh, my god,
is that hideous!
I know.
(laughter)
All we do is we take
this little tool here--
It's called the lasso.
okay.
Enter, and voila.
Your pimple is no more.
Oh, my... yikes.
(laughter)
Sharks, we want to get
pc classes online
David, how did you meet Bruce?
He taught my mother to skype.
Now I can't get rid of her.
(laughing)
I turn on the computer,
there she is.
(laughter)
Why are you bundling
your sales
with hardware sales?
What's your logic
behind that?
Both of my parents
are therapists,
(Mark)
I got to tell you, David.
I used to write for
"Computer reseller news,"
so I'm very familiar...
I love the idea
of classes online...
in 1985.
And believe me, David,
it's not worth
a million dollars.
I'm out.
Dave, there's three sharks
that are out.
Mm-Hmm.
David, horrible idea,
horrible pitch,
horrible valuation.
I'm out.
It's all right.
Thank you.
Well, unlike the other sharks,
I think there is a need
for live classes
to the 50-plus crowd.
David, you made us laugh.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Come on, let's get sushi.
(laughter)
Thanks, Bruce.
Humor battles everything.
Yeah, because
that idea sucked.
He was terrible.
I don't think so.
I think Bruce
just wanted to meet Barbara.
He's my type.
Sharks, you ripped me
a new one.
It was brutal.
But I still love you.
Like Barbara..."
(laughter)
"Who suck out all the profits
in their transaction fees
"up-Front--3% to 6%,
so I'm already underwater
when I buy a house."
If you could solve
that problem,
get rid of the barbaras
of the world,
then you'd have something.
Get me directly
to the buyer, maybe,
so I don't have to get
all of that value
sucked out by Barbara.
We still need Barbara
as an expert...
no, we don't.
We gotta get rid of her.
But we don't trust
the barbaras.
We never need Barbara.
We don't trust
the barbaras, right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop using "Barbara."
Sorry.
(Barbara) I feel I'm missing
something basic here.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm an investor.
I want to buy in Los Angeles.
I have $400,000 to spend,
knowing what's going to happen
in the L.A. market
over the next two years,
three years, five years?
How are you able to make
a prediction on value?
And what did you do?
That's my area.
What did it do?
Okay, I'm interested.
I want to buy a home in l.A.
How do you make money
for me?
Okay.
Okay.
So right now maybe you're
going to a foreclosure
Web site...
Here, you can get the M.L.S.
And the auction data.
and the foreclosure
auction data...
okay.
I'm analyzing it for you.
(snaps fingers)
I'm gonna instantly give you
the deals in your criteria
in your e-mail every day.
So you're really going--
You're not going after
the one-Time buyer.
You're going after somebody
who's investing in real estate,
which is a subset of
the real estate buyer market.
You're almost a service entity
for a very small vertical
of financial buyers.
The normal home buyer
that buys
$5 million properties--
Residential properties--
No, no, you're confusing me.
Is it for the normal couple
that's going out to buy a home,
or is it for the shark
out there
who wants to get
a foreclosure property
(Daymond) He reminded me of you,
Barbara.
(laughs)
He wasn't
a dishonest guy.
He just didn't present well.
Did he leave
with an extra orifice?
(laughs)
the answer is "Yes."
Wow.
Whoa.
But, no,
we're taking orders,
What would that be?
Diarrhea.
on the table,
from Barbara.
But she wants
a whopping 33% of the company
for just her half
of the investment.
You're a vicious granny.
I-I--
I'm not vicious at all.
You have half offers
from Kevin and Barbara.
for 25%...
(Kevin) Whoa.
But you, just like Barbara,
are dumping Kevin to the curb.
I'm dumping Kevin.
The only reason why
is because I feel this
Barbara crap growing on them,
Don't be mean to grandma.
Bye.
Thanks, ladies.
Bye.
