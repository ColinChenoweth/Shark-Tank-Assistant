They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.

into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.

Sharks, I'm Bill Lyons,
and my business is revestor,
the real estate search engine
of the future.
Today, I'm seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Revestor's doing
for real estate
what the internet's done
for car buying
and stock trading.
Revestor gives you access
to information
that only investors
have had up until now.
Say you're a first-time
home buyer.
You want to make sure
you're doing everything
the right way, but you
also want all the answers...
(snaps fingers)
Instantly at your fingertips
so you can figure it out
for yourself.
Mr. Wonderful...
I'm here.
Let's say you're
a real estate investor...
I am.
And you want one thing--
To make money.
The most money possible.
And you know one of the hardest
things to do in the first place
is to find deals.
Go on.
Let me give you a quick tour
and show you how it works.
You go to the home page
and you simply tell it
what kind of property
you're looking for.
Then it tells you
which properties
have the most potential
in a map and list view.
You can then go
to the detail page,
and it gives you all the key
real estate indicators
that are associated
with the property.
It's so easy to use,
anyone can do it.
For example, mark,
Barbara, Robert,
let's say that you all
recently bought similar homes.
What you don't know
is that house "a"
has the potential
to make money.
House "B" is gonna break even.
House "C," unfortunately,
is upside down and underwater.
Question is, which one of you
bought house "C"?
So, Bill, how do you predict
the value of a house
five years from now?
Well, our proprietary
algorithm
makes some assumptions,
but obviously
it's up to the user
to decide
what they believe--
(Robert) Tell me about
the proprietary algorithm
that you use.
Like, what criteria do you use
to come up with the best deal?
The--the patent
is submitted on the fact
that we have the ability
to generate and search
by key real estate
indicators.
Like what?
Where are you
getting the data from?
(Robert) Like what?
Just the same source
Everybody else has?
We-We're partnered
with the largest
listing distributor
in the United States.
Which is?
Listhub and point2.
Oh, there are so many of them.
I thought, Bill,
when you came out here
you were gonna say, "look,
"the world has a huge problem.
"It's full of blood-sucking
real estate agents
do $100 million in revenue,
and be a billion-dollar company.
I've done this before.
I'm not a "wantrepreneur."
I've been around
the block before.
Okay, what did you do before?
I built a $20 million company
from scratch.
What kind of company was it
and what did you do?
It was a financial services
company.
(Kevin) Really?
Bill, you're only gonna
have that person--
Bill, you're talking out of
both sides of your mouth.
It's incredible.
Okay, Bill, let me see if I
get it, and maybe that'll help.
Okay. Okay. Thank you.
So you're buying the data
from the two sources.
Right.
That gives you
M.L.S. listings,
the listings of all the houses
that are for sale,
plus another source that's
giving you the auction listings.
Right.
Right. And you'll give me
a little bit of help
with your "algorithms."
Right. You're not using
an archaic spreadsheet.
I'm gonna pay you $99 a month
for access to that?
Right.
You want--
I hate that business.
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, Bill, I'm glad that Mark
explained it to me as well,
because if it was that hard
for you to explain it to me,
it's gonna be
that much harder
for you to explain
to customers,
and that pitch was underwater.
I'm out.
I buy a lot
of foreclosed property
in my local market,
because I understand it,
and I have access to brokers
who have great information.
They have certain information
that is on no web site.
I don't think you can possibly
think of a formula
that will lead me
to the right conclusion
that this is a great investment
or it's not a great investment.
But you do have one
great thing going for you.
Nobody can tell
if you're wrong. (laughs)
No one's gonna know
if you're ever right,
because the only time
you find out whether you
indicated a great investment
or not
is when I go to sell it
in two years,
five years, eight years.
And where are you gonna be then?
I'm out.
Thank you.
Bill, you have
no business concept.
You talk out of
both sides of your mouth.
I'm gonna build this company
to a $100 million Company
right next to zillow.
(Robert) Bill, there's nothing
wrong with believing that.
But the presentation
you came up with today
made you appear like
a bit of a con artist.
I'm not a s--
I'm out.
You're getting your ass
kicked in here.
I-I know.
And, you know, I always
respect somebody
that comes out of
financial services,
'cause it's a very tough space.
And the one
you've come out of
was a really tough space.
So you're trying
to get back in the game.
Nothing wrong with that,
but won't be with me. I'm out.
Thank you.
Everybody's out?
Bill, you gotta leave now
before it gets better.
Okay. Thank you. (laughs)
(laughs)
(Bill) I clearly blew it
out there. It was brutal.
It was like I walked
into a wood chipper.
