Diarrhea.
Ooh!
Ha!
You guys don't make it easy,
do you?
Welcome to the "Shark Tank."
and I just kind of had
this idea.
I saw a flier
for a costume contest.
And I saw a chance to, like,
definitely make my money back,
my investment back,
even if it was just
selling the costume
after I created it.
Can I ask you a question?
I'm sorry.
Absolutely.
So... I get you put it on.
Mm-Hmm.
Then how do you go?
It's a hand switch.
(whirs)
OHH!
(laughs)
Oh, that's cool.
And it's--
I know it's mechanical
and technological-Looking,
but honestly, all it is
is a positive/negative wire
to a battery with a switch.
Is that insurable?
I actually think these
are safer
than most, uh, like,
standing apparatuses.
Because you're so close
to the ground,
you can't fall, yeah.
How big is the box
that you ship this in?
I have not, uh, yet
begun selling them.
Whoa. Don't like that.
You know what?
These guys are wasting time.
I call these guys hammerheads,
'cause they think
that everything that
walks in the door is a nail,
and they just try
to pound 'em.
Because it works, Mark,
that's why.
You--It doesn't work.
You guys--You guys aren't
about--look.
You guys aren't about
a product yet. So you've got--
what are they about?
You guys have gone
and you've won all this money
at costume parties.
Tell me how much money
you've made,
what you've been
hired to do.
My daily rate is usually--
for a costume,
for an 8-hour day, is I usually
charge $300 or $400.
That's it?
Oh, my gosh.
That's...
that's nothing.
Way too low.
Wha-What is it you want?
You want to be a circus
performer, or you want to sell
500,000 units
through the toy chains?
That's what I would
like to do.
Like I said, I'd much rather
mass manufacture them and--
Okay, so you need
a partner to do that.
Absolutely.
So why wouldn't you
take this to a toy company,
partner with them?
They're currently paying
between 5% and 7% in royalties.
You'd make some money,
my friend.
Sir.
(Mark) what they're really
gonna say is,
"It's not quite ready.
"We're not gonna pay you
7% of anything right now,
"because there's nothing
to pay.
"We're not gonna pay you
an upfront fee.
"and, oh, by the way,
even if we like it,
we're gonna take six months
to put together a contract,"
and meanwhile you're
sitting around doing nothing.
So, Mark, you want to send
this guy into a destiny
of being a circus performer?
(Robert)
Here--Here's my challenge.
You want to manufacture these.
As we've decided,
this is one of the rare times
I think unless you have
a patent
or some proprietary
technology,
you're gonna be in trouble.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Hello, sharks.
My name is David A. Cox.
I am the C.E.O. And founder
of pc classes online.
I am seeking $150,000
in exchange
for 15% equity
in my business.
For two years, I managed
an Apple computers dealer
in Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
where I taught
basic computer classes
to the general public.
These classes exploded
in popularity.
And one day,
I was teaching a class,
and I looked out
into the audience,
and I discovered something.
Every single person
in that audience
was over the age of 50.
I had my "Aha!" moment.
There is a massive demand
in this world
for someone who can
teach technology
to the 50-plus crowd.
And here to help explain
and demo our service,
I have with me
our new student,
the one and only
Bruce Vilanch.
It's--It's the "Mona Lisa."
(laughs)
Well, there's one tiny flaw.
There's a zit.
It's not a tiny zit.
It's Mount St. Zit.
Oh, my god,
is that hideous!
I know.
(laughter)
All we do is we take
this little tool here--
It's called the lasso.
And we're just gonna circle
that sucker right there.
Hold shift, tap delete...
okay.
Enter, and voila.
Your pimple is no more.
Oh, my... yikes.
(laughter)
Sharks, we want to get
pc classes online
into the hands
of every computer
and gadget retailer.
By bundling our service
with their hardware sales,
we can dramatically
increase both of our profit.
David, how did you meet Bruce?
He taught my mother to skype.
Now I can't get rid of her.
(laughing)
I turn on the computer,
there she is.
(laughter)
Why are you bundling
your sales
with hardware sales?
What's your logic
behind that?
Both of my parents
are therapists,
and they taught me
a very interesting
basic rule in psychology,
that if you can touch it,
it's real.
So instead of just saying,
"Hey, why don't you
buy these classes?",
by putting it
in their hands,
they can touch it.
It makes it real.
We sell our service
for $199 a year.
And through the retailer,
we sell it to them at $99.
They're getting 100% markup.
So you don't want a bundle.
You want it to be sold
as an add-On?
Yes.
You don't even know
what you want.
You don't even understand
the difference
between a bundle
and an add-on.
A bundle is when you
put together two products
or services for one price.
An add-on is something
you add to in a sale
afterwards for more money.
You don't even get that.
You're a bozo.
Do you have any sales?
We've only been in existence
for six months,
but we have about
115 members.
How much did it come to
in revenue?
We're currently, uh,
right around thirty--
$35,000.
(sighs)
Let's say I go
to a large manufacturer
and I say, "bundle this
into a million laptops."
Mm-hmm.
You don't have the capacity
to service them.
You'd blow up in two seconds.
If it was that many,
we would have to expand
rapidly.
You think? (laughs)
(laughs)
We do not pay our teachers,
because what we offer them
is at the end of teaching
a class, the teacher can say,
"if you'd like to do
a private lesson,
here's how you can
sign up for it."
You need slave grunts
that work for free initially,
and then you hope that some
percentage of those individuals
end up getting
a direct relationship
with your customers,
and you get a piece of it?
We get 30%.
You are valuing this business
at $1 million.
Okay. So, is there anything else
that you can tell me
that's gonna give me
the "Aha!" moment
that it's worth
a million dollars?
What it comes down to
is passion.
Mmm.
Ha!
Oh, no, no, no. I--
that's such a huge--
You're the only person
that has passion.
That's such a differentiator.
I want to hear this one!
Thank god we finally found
somebody with passion.
(Mark)
I got to tell you, David.
I used to write for
"Computer reseller news,"
so I'm very familiar...
I love the idea
of classes online...
in 1985.
It's been done again
and again and again.
And to come in as
your differentiation being
50 years old, yet you haven't
said a single, solitary word
about what you're going to do
to identify
50-plus-year-old consumers,
and you've got bundling
confused
with up-sell at retailers.
I don't think you have
a single, solitary clue
about what you're going to do
to run your business.
Now you may think
I'm gonna go out
after saying all that...
and you would be right.
I'm out.
(laughter)
Dave, there's no market
for this.
115 users.
$35,000 in sales.
As an investment,
you're about, uh,
30 years too late. I'm out.
What I think is so remarkable
if you've got people
doing this for free for you.
You're basically
a online computer pimp.
And believe me, David,
it's not worth
a million dollars.
I'm out.
Dave, there's three sharks
that are out.
Mm-Hmm.
David, horrible idea,
horrible pitch,
horrible valuation.
I'm out.
It's all right.
Thank you.
Well, unlike the other sharks,
I think there is a need
for live classes
to the 50-plus crowd.
And this isn't it.
I don't know
if this is it or not,
but I think you've got
to do it from the ground up
and get some traction.
So, with that, I'm out.
Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate your time.
David, you made us laugh.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Come on, let's get sushi.
(laughter)
Thanks, Bruce.
Humor battles everything.
Yeah, because
that idea sucked.
He was terrible.
I don't think so.
I think Bruce
just wanted to meet Barbara.
He's my type.
Sharks, you ripped me
a new one.
It was brutal.
But I still love you.
Like Barbara..."
(laughter)
"Who suck out all the profits
in their transaction fees
"up-Front--3% to 6%,
so I'm already underwater
when I buy a house."
If you could solve
that problem,
get rid of the barbaras
of the world,
then you'd have something.
Get me directly
to the buyer, maybe,
so I don't have to get
all of that value
sucked out by Barbara.
We still need Barbara
as an expert...
no, we don't.
We gotta get rid of her.
But we don't trust
the barbaras.
We never need Barbara.
We don't trust
the barbaras, right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop using "Barbara."
Sorry.
(Barbara) I feel I'm missing
something basic here.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm an investor.
I want to buy in Los Angeles.
I have $400,000 to spend,
and I have 30% down.
How are you going to locate
the best house,
not being a fortune-Teller,
knowing what's going to happen
in the L.A. market
over the next two years,
three years, five years?
How are you able to make
a prediction on value?
Best question--
I don't understand
what your magic sauce is here.
Best question so far.
It--It gives you
key indicators
that are associated
with the property to see--
Like what?!
for example? For example?
For example, cash flow,
cap rate,
return on investment.
That's a spreadsheet.
It--
That's a spreadsheet.
Buddy, I can calculate that
on my own.
No, we're not cut-And-Pasting
a spreadsheet online.
That's not what we're doing.
We're giv--
So what are you doing?
We're giving people "a"--
house "a," "B," "C"--
Which is better?
What's the value of that?
I want to stop them
from ripping you apart,
so maybe I can help you.
(chuckles) Thank you.
Do you have any sales?
We're in ten cities so far.
Our revenue model's
not rolled out yet.
I'm not here to mess around
and make a few thousand bucks.
I want to be one of the largest
real estate web sites,
And what did you do?
That's my area.
What did it do?
We're mortgage, real estate,
and life insurance.
I know that business very well.
And what happened?
2007, all of our lenders
stopped funding deals,
and it--It was horrible.
I lost $1 million in a day.
Okay. You know something
about this business.
But why couldn't you use
your software to predict that?
(laughs) The software
didn't exist then.
(Kevin)
What you haven't said is,
"here's my model
and how I make revenue."
Okay, I'm interested.
I want to buy a home in l.A.
How do you make money
for me?
Okay.
Okay.
So right now maybe you're
going to a foreclosure
Web site...
yes.
To get auction data,
and you're spending
50 bucks a month for that.
Here, you can get the M.L.S.
And the auction data.
The auction sites just give you
the date and the time
of the auction.
So I buy the subscription
for $49.95 a month?
$99.
Because--
$99 a month?
Because you're getting both.
You're getting the m.L.S. Data
and the foreclosure
auction data...
okay.
I'm analyzing it for you.
(snaps fingers)
I'm gonna instantly give you
the deals in your criteria
in your e-mail every day.
So you're really going--
You're not going after
the one-Time buyer.
You're going after somebody
who's investing in real estate,
which is a subset of
the real estate buyer market.
You're almost a service entity
for a very small vertical
of financial buyers.
The normal home buyer
that buys
$5 million properties--
Residential properties--
No, no, you're confusing me.
Is it for the normal couple
that's going out to buy a home,
or is it for the shark
out there
who wants to get
a foreclosure property
and rent it out or flip it?
Which is your audience?
I-It's for both,
because people
are scared to buy.
They want more information.
(Daymond) He reminded me of you,
Barbara.
(laughs)
He wasn't
a dishonest guy.
He just didn't present well.
Did he leave
with an extra orifice?
(laughs)
the answer is "Yes."
Wow.
Whoa.
But, no,
we're taking orders,
shipping ice chips,
and negotiating prices
all over the world.
We may have started out
as two grannies in a garage...
(laughs)
But believe me,
we've grown
far beyond that now.
And all we had to give up
was the thrilling life
of scrapbooking and quilting
many of our friends enjoy.
(laughter)
Not.
Not!
(laughter)
Now we'd like you
to try our ice chips.
Nicely done.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What would that be?
Diarrhea.
(Daymond and Barbara) Oh.
Oh.
(laughing)
(Daymond) It's not
like a laxative.
I'm just trying to get
clarity.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not like a laxative.
All right, you guys can
continue to eat them then.
You're a couple of grannies
on steroids. I get it.
(laughing)
You're valuing
your ice chips business
at $1.67 million.
Yes.
That's quite a bit.
Explain to me why you think
it's worth that much money.
This year,
up through Friday,
our sales for ice chips
was $342,000.
Really?
Yes.
Last year,
sales were $360,000.
on the table,
from Barbara.
But she wants
a whopping 33% of the company
for just her half
of the investment.
You're a vicious granny.
I-I--
I'm not vicious at all.
Ladies, what else
is in this candy?
(Barbara) Hold on. Hold on.
Finish, Barb. Finish, Barb.
Please, please, please.
(laughs)
What I guarantee you--
as part of the offer--
is that I'll get you
in 3,000 big box stores
to sell your product.
Ooh. Interesting.
And that's worth
a lot of money.
Would you feel free
to take out your dentures
and throw it at her...
(laughing)
For that rude
and insensitive offer?
What is wrong with that?
How long would it take you
to get into all those
big box stores?
Not long.
Grannies, I want to put
the other half up
that Barbara needs, and you
get something else from me.
I'm gonna talk her back
into sanity on value.
So what I'm gonna say is this--
I'll put up the other
$125,000,
and we will each get
20% each.
So we're taking 40%,
not 66%.
You know what?
I will retrench a bit
on that value,
but not with this guy.
He's no fun to work with.
He's totally focused
on money,
and you both know
it's not about the money.
You need somebody
like Mr. Wonderful
in the model.
Trust me, you don't need him.
So I'll do that deal. Any other
guys wanna do that deal?
No problem.
But not with this guy.
So I'll do $125,000 for 20%,
because I must say,
I did feel a little bit greedy.
Look at the value I've
created for you already.
I took her down
from being insane,
asking for 66%.
(Daymond) Well, I'm--I'm--
I'm interested.
My only concern is
I don't want, uh, you guys
to be doing the manufacturing.
I don't want to have to learn
that part of the business.
So what I'd be interested in
is $250,000 for...
30%,
and we go out and take
the manufacturing elsewhere.
Do we have any other offers?
Solid?
Patience is a virtue.
(laughs)
(Daymond)
I'm the only full offer.
You have half offers
from Kevin and Barbara.
Well, Barbara doesn't want
to play in this candy box.
And these savages
want to take 40%
of your company.
I-I delivered so much value
to the grannies,
and I'm getting nothing for it.
I'm really heartbroken.
We're smiling at you pretty,
if that helps. (laughs)
It helps.
I'm interested in working
with Barbara,
because I think she works really
well with consumer products.
I see a lot of ways
that we can work together.
So I'm happy to go in
with Barbara
at $125k for 20%,
and $125k for 20%.
You know, when I put out
my offer,
I was hoping
Mark would jump in with me.
There's no better partner here.
(inhales)
Ladies, it--
It's sweeter than I would
have offered you.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay, grannies,
let's shake it up a bit.
I want back in this deal.
Okay, so here's what
I'm gonna propose.
I want to join Daymond.
So he'll put up $125,000.
I'll put up $125,000.
So you get your $250,000.
But I want to be part
of a 35% deal.
All right?
But you get two sharks.
And it's still way less
than what Barbara and Mark
are asking for.
They're so greedy.
Ooh! So, grandmas...
(Daymond) I think--
Yeah, I think, uh...
grandmas, you--
That might sweeten the deal.
Uh, if you have two sharks
here for less percentage.
So, grandmas,
Kevin and Daymond,
or Mark and Barbara?
The sweet deal,
or the yuck mouths?
The vindictive deal,
or the honest deal?
We know.
We know.
Oh, you do? Wow.
(Daymond)
I've decided that--
(Kevin) What--
I've decided that I-I'm
dropping my partner already...
Oh.
And I'm going down--
Whoa, everything
changes in the tank!
And I'm going down
to 25% for $250,000.
(Robert and Mark) WHOA!
Whoa!
Daymond, what happened there?
Your offer is $250,000
for 25%...
(Kevin) Whoa.
But you, just like Barbara,
are dumping Kevin to the curb.
I'm dumping Kevin.
The only reason why
is because I feel this
Barbara crap growing on them,
and I want to make sure
that they don't make
the wrong decision.
So, what are you gonna do?
You can tell.
Okay.
We're gonna go
with Barbara and Mark.
Ahh!
Good decision.
Yes!
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Smart people.
You picked the good people.
I never liked grandmothers.
Don't be mean to grandma.
Bye.
Thanks, ladies.
Bye.
