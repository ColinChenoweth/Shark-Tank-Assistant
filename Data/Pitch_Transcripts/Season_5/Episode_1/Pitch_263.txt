James, what are
the different flavors?
(James) Our sexy red velvet
needs no introduction.
(Barbara) Mmm!
These mind-blowing cake balls...
yummy.
Have the savory cake
on the inside
(James)
Our chocolate Sweet Ballz
are dipped in
milk chocolate Icing
(James) Well,
we both have experience
bringing items to retail.
Me, I used to work
in sports marketing
around the Dallas area.
Okay, James, things--Things
are going great for you.
Why are you here?
Because for us,
it's about growth.
Right now one of the things
we have is a 21-Day turnaround.
The $250,000 would be used
to offset
some of our inventory needs
so that we could get away
from that 21-day lead time,
'cause some of the retailers
that we've talked to right now
want to be able to turn it
faster than 21 days.
So you're asking for $250,000
for 25%?
For 10% of the company.
(laughter)
(Kevin) Yeah--
Here's what's wrong
with the 10%--
Nobody gets excited
about 10%.
Understood.
Nobody's interested in 10%.
What, uh... what would
get you interested?
Oh, big numbers. 80%, 90%.
(laughing)
Oh, yeah.
That works for me, too.
Is that your offer, Barbara?
$250,000 for 90%?
(Lori) 90%?
Hey, I'll give you an offer.
I'll give you $250,000
for 40%.
Ba-Bam!
Okay.
Thank you for the offer, too.
(laughs)
(Robert)
Ah, very nice, James.
Well, it's not--You know,
not saying it's, you know,
directly no, but thank you
for the offer.
Do you guys want
to consult on that?
Well...
(laughter)
Or the--hopefully
there's, uh,
at least one other offer
out there.
Have you paid yourself
anything?
Uh, we have.
We've taken a distribution.
How big is your distribution?
Uh, amounts to roughly
$2,500, $3,000 a month.
(Kevin) I like it,
'cause it's close to a space
I'm very involved in now,
particularly the commercial
kitchen logistics side.
Wicked Good Cupcakes--
We're making a lot of money
in that company.
I'll do the $250,000 for 30%,
but here is the covenant
that I'm gonna put on it,
because I'm concerned in all
the food deals I've ever done
in getting my capital back
before I die.
Sure.
So when you make
a distribution,
I get one, too--
Dollar for dollar.
So I'm just like a partner
that started at the top,
except I paid a whole lot more
for it.
We-We'd like to also know,
like, which retailer
you--You have
relationships at
that you could also help us
get into.
So, James, I'll give you
the $250,000 for 25%.
But I'm not investing
in my retail strategy.
(James) Mm-hmm.
I'm investing
in the two of you guys.
Mm-hmm.
(Lori) You need a shark
that knows how to keep you
in the retailer.
Because it's--We can get in,
we can break down the door.
Some of us, I think
more doors than others.
Don't sell yourself short.
But--No.
(Lori) I think
some more than others.
But you also have to think
about who--What strategic
partner do you want.
(lowered voice)
I like these guys,
