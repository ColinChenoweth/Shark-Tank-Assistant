Hi, sharks.
My name is Josh Brooks.
I'm the founder
of on the run tech
Thanks, Josh.
You bet.
So let's go through what this
postcard actually really is.
So we got
a beautiful 4x6 photo.
Then on the back
you write a simple note.
We built a telestrator.
So you actually
take your finger, sign it,
so it's really you, Robert,
This is my my daughter
Leni Brooks.
"Hey, Mark, your friend
Josh Brooks is trying
to send you a postcard."
Oh, that's cool.
Is there a novelty to it,
though?
(Robert) Okay, Josh,
walk me through the money.
How do I pay for it?
How do you make money?
So it's a free application,
but it's $2.49 per postcard.
What are your margins after
you've paid all the royalties
on the databases you're using?
We built all of our databases.
There are no royalties.
Do you own this business
yourself?
That's correct. I actually have
a group of investors as well.
You do.
Uh, I did. I raised
a little bit of capital
to get this off the ground.
Keep in mind, I put 30,000 bucks
of my own money
to get this thing going.
Josh, how many downloads
of the app do you have?
Just around 500,000, uh,
downloads of the application.
Josh, let's go back
to the investors for a sec.
How much money did you raise
in total?
We raised $1.6 million
in total.
So, Josh, your strategy is
to run like hell
because there's nothing
proprietary here.
Anybody can do this.
Let's be honest with each other.
Well, being totally honest,
that is not correct.
It takes a tremendous amount
of ingenuity
to do what we did.
Okay, but--
Absolutely.
That's easy to do. There's tons
of people who do that.
This is not a one-winner
takes all.
This is about coming up
with a great product
that people absolutely love.
But that doesn't mean
it can't be replicated easily
by using third party products.
But that is the 1,000-Pound
postcard in the room.
Yeah, no, absolutely.
Josh, I'm telling you--
but the point being is that
we've hit the market.
We've got--If you look
at web sites,
if you look at bloggers,
you look at editorial,
they're gonna point
to our product.
Here's the problem, Josh.
The concept of valuing this
at $6 million is ridiculous.
You live in
the silicon valley bubble,
Josh, you could stay up
all night.
That doesn't mean
you're gonna get lucky, right?
Totally.
You've gotta get lucky
in order
for this to really work
for investors.
Absolutely.
You have to have an exit
that takes some luck,
Yeah, Josh,
I do see the vision.
But I kind of
agree with Mark.
Your value is
a silicon valley bubble,
Josh Brooks has one last chance
to make a deal.
I'm not comfortable
with a $6 million valuation.
But I am comfortable
with a $3 million valuation.
So I'll do $300,000 for 10%.
I'm not sure
if I can do that.
(Kevin) Tough decision, Josh.
It is.
It gives you another six months
of life.
Let me ask you this.
Let me ask you this.
Would you consider doing
something more on the lines
of a $5 million valuation?
Under two years.
Josh, the only guy up here
that believed in the vision
as soon as you came out
that saw it...
sure.
I mean, you've got a fan here
in the technology.
I think you've done it. Uh...
but not in the price.
You're not a fan of his price.
Thank you.
Good job, Josh.
I appreciate it.
Yeah, good job, man.
(Mark) Congrats, Josh.
I think it's
a phenomenal idea.
I think it's a crapshoot.
I know there's products
similar...
you have to be acquired,
or you're going to zero.
(laughs)
