Hi, sharks.
My name is Josh Brooks.
I'm the founder
of on the run tech
and postcard on the run.
Today I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange for 5% equity
in my company.
If you're anything like me,
you've got 22,000 photos
stashed away on a hard drive,
another thousand
Cluttering up your phone.
Maybe put it up on facebook
for 13 seconds,
e-mail 'em to a friend,
and ba-bam, they're gone.
They deserve more. Our product
is the answer to this.
It's called
postcard on the run.
Take a picture from wherever
you are in the world.
Write a quick note.
Sign it with your finger,
and send it to anywhere
in the world
right from the convenience
of your mobile phone.
And what do you get?
Voilà. A beautiful 4x6
glossy personalized note
that arrives in the mail
in a matter of days.
We live a life on the run.
This product helps us connect
better than We've ever
connected in the world.
Sharks, we've got a platform
product. Today it's postcards.
Tomorrow it's
a tremendous amount more.
Join me today
in the memory business, guys.
So we actually got
some mail for you.
I love getting mail.
It's fun.
Special for you.
It's fun. Oh, thank you.
(Lori) Aw! (laughs)
Thank you.
All right.
(Barbara) Wow, great.
Thanks, Josh.
You bet.
So let's go through what this
postcard actually really is.
So we got
a beautiful 4x6 photo.
Then on the back
you write a simple note.
We built a telestrator.
So you actually
take your finger, sign it,
so it's really you, Robert,
and then
a really great feature.
This is my my daughter
Leni Brooks.
This was actually
a thank-You note to her grandma.
You scan it with your, uh,
your--your mobile device.
Right here.
It's a Q.R. code.
And ba-bam. Now you got
a short little video.
Take a look.
? Thank you, thank you,
thank you ?
? thank you,
thank you, thank you ?
(laughs)
? Thank you ?
"Hey, Mark, your friend
Josh Brooks is trying
to send you a postcard."
Oh, that's cool.
Is there a novelty to it,
though?
You know, you send one
to grandma and grandpa,
and then you send it again
and then you send it again,
and then it's sort of like,
"Oh, another postcard."
I mean, do you find the--
it--there's a--
Uh, I don't think you're
gonna find any of that.
In fact, the people that are
on the receiving end
of these postcards--
Postcard fatigue.
Honestly, $2.49--goose bumps
are totally included,
and that's what ends up
happening.
(Robert) Okay, Josh,
walk me through the money.
How do I pay for it?
How do you make money?
So it's a free application,
but it's $2.49 per postcard.
What are your margins after
you've paid all the royalties
on the databases you're using?
We built all of our databases.
There are no royalties.
Do you own this business
yourself?
That's correct. I actually have
a group of investors as well.
You do.
Uh, I did. I raised
a little bit of capital
to get this off the ground.
Keep in mind, I put 30,000 bucks
of my own money
to get this thing going.
And what is your background that
you've come up with this idea?
I used to run marketing
for myspace
during the good days
for three and a half years.
What are your sales?
That's all that really matters.
Sure. So in the 21 months,
we've done $450,000 in revenue.
Okay, and you've made...
(Robert) Wow.
How much money on that?
Everything goes right back
into the company, 100%.
Josh, how many downloads
of the app do you have?
Just around 500,000, uh,
downloads of the application.
Josh, let's go back
to the investors for a sec.
How much money did you raise
in total?
We raised $1.6 million
in total.
And what was the valuation
of the 1.6 you raised
in the valley?
$6 million.
You're giving us the same value,
am I right?
That's right.
So, Josh, your strategy is
to run like hell
because there's nothing
proprietary here.
Anybody can do this.
Let's be honest with each other.
Well, being totally honest,
that is not correct.
It takes a tremendous amount
of ingenuity
to do what we did.
Okay, but--
Absolutely.
That's easy to do. There's tons
of people who do that.
This is not a one-winner
takes all.
This is about coming up
with a great product
that people absolutely love.
But that doesn't mean
it can't be replicated easily
by using third party products.
But that is the 1,000-Pound
postcard in the room.
Yeah, no, absolutely.
Josh, I'm telling you--
but the point being is that
we've hit the market.
We've got--If you look
at web sites,
if you look at bloggers,
you look at editorial,
and they talk about
"Hey, what's interesting
connecting the online
to offline?"
they're gonna point
to our product.
Here's the problem, Josh.
The concept of valuing this
at $6 million is ridiculous.
You live in
the silicon valley bubble,
and it's gonna burst.
Either you get acquired,
or you're out of luck,
because there's
no I.P.O. market anymore
for middle-sized companies
like yours,
so you have to get acquired.
I hear your point, right?
My point is this,
is that we haven't even
begun marketing, right?
I get that. Look, you fell
to the silicon valley curse.
If you were to come in here,
Saying, look,
"We gotta raise $200,000
or $300,000
at a $2 million valuation,"
then we can visualize,
okay, nice little business,
and we could sell it
for 6.
But you're already at 6.
Mark--
The problem is you've gotta
sell it big
to get any type of return
for us.
So I-I think what I have is
a great group of investors
that are super supportive
of us.
Josh, you could stay up
all night.
That doesn't mean
you're gonna get lucky, right?
Totally.
You've gotta get lucky
in order
for this to really work
for investors.
Absolutely.
You have to have an exit
that takes some luck,
and I just don't see it.
How much cash do you have
left in the bank?
We have $185,00
in the bank.
You're screwed. I'm out.
Out of $1.6 million,
you're down to $185,000?
$185,000, correct.
You're gonna blow up
in 90 days, you don't get cash.
You need to raise right now
this $300,000.
You are running like
that little postcard guy.
There is nothing proprietary
about what you're doing.
I'm not diminishing
your business.
I'm just telling you I could
do it for less than $6 million.
Absolutely not what I invest
in this. I'm out.
(Barbara) There's a couple
things I really like.
I like nothing better than
a friend sending me
an actual photograph.
I take hundreds of them
of my kids,
but I never print them out,
and there's a difference.
Exactly.
So when I get a photo
in the mail,
for me it's a present,
all right?
Mm-hmm.
The idea that I would get
also wrapped into that
a postcard is great.
I think of a postcard
as a present, too.
Sure.
Nobody sends them anymore,
and of your kid...
sure.
It's a win, all right?
Sure.
But there's something
that really disturbs me,
and that is
this postcard lacks
in the warm and fuzzy
emotional piece
which you're hard-selling here,
is that it's typefaced.
Can you scroll your whole
message or only your signature?
Today we can just do
your signature and a picture.
Well, that's a problem.
Tomorrow there's no reason
why we couldn't do any of that.
It takes the warm and fuzzy
out of it for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
Guys, we've got a business
that actually brings in money.
It's $450,000 in 21 months.
Yeah, but you have hardly
any money left.
We have not added any gasoline
to that flame at all.
So out of the downloads
or the users,
what's the age range?
Our target market
would be
somewhere in this
21-to-45-year-old female,
but my partner and investor
in the company is Selena Gomez.
Sorry. The Selena Gomez
that my kids love?
Totally.
Uh, she invested
in both rounds--
The angel round as well as
the seed round of financing.
My kids travel
all over the place.
I love my kids.
I miss my kids.
They never e-mail me.
They never text me.
I think my kids would use this.
They're always sending
pictures.
They never...
so what you're saying--
they won't take the time
to e-mail or text, but they're
gonna download an app,
take the picture,
and click "Send"?
Yeah, Mark,
because they know daddy--They
know that daddy would love it.
I think it's a great idea,
but, you know, you said,
"I have patents pending."
You don't know if
you're going to get it or not
and really get out there
fast and furious.
And for that reason, I'm out.
All right.
All right, who's left here?
Robert, I think.
Robert sees the vision.
Yeah, Josh,
I do see the vision.
But I kind of
agree with Mark.
Your value is
a silicon valley bubble,
and you'd have to sell
for an enormous amount
just to get some return.
Right.
I love the idea, though.
I think it's a great vision.
I appreciate that.
But... I'm not comfortable
with the $6 million valuation.
But I am comfortable
with a $3 million valuation.
So I'll do $300,000 for 10%.
I'm not sure
if I can do that.
Josh Brooks has one last chance
to make a deal.
I'm not comfortable
with a $6 million valuation.
But I am comfortable
with a $3 million valuation.
So I'll do $300,000 for 10%.
I'm not sure
if I can do that.
(Kevin) Tough decision, Josh.
It is.
It gives you another six months
of life.
Let me ask you this.
Let me ask you this.
Would you consider doing
something more on the lines
of a $5 million valuation?
And that's 6% of your company.
Correct.
That allows me to keep
my current group of investors
that I have
a lot of respect for
and also, that 300k is going
right into the marketing.
After $1.6 million in 2 years,
you're down
to the last $180,000,
and the reason I think my money
brings the premium is
you can't survive
without that money.
Robert, you Savage,
are you gonna take advantage
of his situation just 'cause
he's running out of money?
You're gonna cut his knees off?
It's my money. I worked
really hard for my money.
I get the privilege of saying
what I feel it's worth.
Right.
So...
I'm comfortable with $3 million.
You're saying $5 million.
Now it's up to you.
I think the business lends
itself to something larger,
and I honestly really
appreciate
your enthusiasm
for the company,
but I can't take
that significant of a haircut
on the value
of the company.
(sighs) I'll ask you again.
What about something closer
to the $5 million range?
And even if it's at 4.8.
Find me at 4.8,
and let's do a deal.
Okay, my last offer--$4 million.
That's $300,000 for 7 1/2%.
I think
there's significant value
in having a shark onboard.
(exhales) Hone--
I really appreciate the offer.
I don't think at $4 million
of valuation, I can do that.
But the company
is more than that.
I swear it is. I know it is.
So you're not accepting
his offer.
Find me at 4.5, and let's make
this thing happen.
Listen, you're investing
in a guy that gets things done.
It took two years
to get where we are today--
Under two years.
Josh, the only guy up here
that believed in the vision
as soon as you came out
that saw it...
sure.
I mean, you've got a fan here
in the technology.
I think you've done it. Uh...
but not in the price.
You're not a fan of his price.
I'm not a fan of the price,
and that's my privilege
as a shark.
(sighs) $300,000
at a $4 million valuation--
is that what you're saying?
I'm saying $300,000 at--
For 7 1/2%,
which gives it
a $4 million valuation.
(sighs)
(sighs) Let's do the Deal.
Done.
That's awesome.
Good job, Robert.
Way to hold it out.
(Lori laughs)
Thanks, man.
Nice job today.
Appreciate it.
It's a--It's a great product.
Yeah.
It's awesome.
Thanks so much.
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you.
Good job, Josh.
I appreciate it.
Yeah, good job, man.
(Mark) Congrats, Josh.
I think it's
a phenomenal idea.
I think it's a crapshoot.
I know there's products
similar...
you have to be acquired,
or you're going to zero.
(laughs)
