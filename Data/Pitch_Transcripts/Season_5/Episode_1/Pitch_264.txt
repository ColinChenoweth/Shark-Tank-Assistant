And my name
is James Mcdonald,
and our product
is Sweet Ballz.
(laughs)
That's right. Sweet Ballz.
We're here today seeking
$250,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
Everyone loves
a fresh cake ball,
but very few are interested
in spending
the hours it takes
to create them.
Sharks, so what we did is take
an already-popular product,
the cake pop,
and we gave it a makeover...
simply by removing the stick,
creating a 4-pack,
as well as creating
a quality cake ball
to bring to the masses.
The best part about
our cake balls, sharks--
They sell for a fraction
of the cost
of most local bakery
cake balls.
But before we go any further,
we'd like to pass out
a few samples for you to try.
I hate you already.
(laughs)
Bring on the Sweet Ballz.
James, what are
the different flavors?
(James) Our sexy red velvet
needs no introduction.
(Barbara) Mmm!
These mind-blowing cake balls...
yummy.
Have the savory cake
on the inside
and a decadent icing
on the outside.
(Lori) It's very fudgy.
(James)
Our chocolate Sweet Ballz
are dipped in
milk chocolate Icing
and taste like the cake
that your mama used to make.
My mama?
And our cookies n' cream
Sweet Ballz--
More like cookies and scream,
the way these taste.
These are good.
These are good.
So which one of you sharks
are ready
to make some sweet,
sweet dough
with our Sweet Ballz?
(laughs)
I have a question.
Okay.
You talked a lot
about cake pops.
The ones I have tried...
Mm-hmm.
Weren't really very good.
Sure.
These are very cakey
and very moist.
What's your shelf life?
Uh, we actually have
a 45-day shelf life
for the product, which is
pretty unique because--
Un-Refrigerated?
Un-Refrigerated.
So what were your sales
last month?
Uh, actually,
in the last 90 days,
we've done
$700,000 in sales.
Wow!
Wow!
(Kevin) Say what?
Where are you selling?
No one expected that.
I wasn't expecting that.
(Lori) No.
(Robert) and where
did you sell that?
Uh, it'd be the largest
convenience store
in the United States.
7-Eleven?
7-Eleven.
Wow!
You sell these at 7-Eleven?
Yes.
So what does one 4-pack
sell for?
It retails anywhere
from $1.99 to $2.49.
(Barbara) Really?
Oh, that's nothing.
So $1.99. There you go.
(Robert) Wow.
That's why there's--Okay.
What does it cost you
to make them?
Uh, currently it costs us
86 cents to make.
86 cents.
It's like a dream come True
for a young business to walk in
and get a huge order like that.
How did that come about?
(James) Well,
we both have experience
bringing items to retail.
Me, I used to work
in sports marketing
around the Dallas area.
Uh, and after that, I started
working for a manufacturer.
I really learned the--
The, uh, retail side of things.
But you didn't work for the best
team in the Dallas area, right?
The best team's the Mavericks,
no doubt.
(Robert) Now how about Cole?
Where did you work?
Uh, I've actually been
a-a serial entrepreneur
all my life.
(speaks indistinctly)
Cole, did you have a product
in this kind of
retail environment before?
Uh, I-I've worked in the frozen
food product, uh, category, yes.
Were any of your other
enterprises successful?
Uh, successful as, uh...
where you make money,
the only thing that matters.
(laughter)
Um, I--we have. I mean, we've
had a couple different companies
that have--Have made money.
Um, unfortunately for us,
we didn't have
the right partnership
or we weren't able to raise
the capital that we needed
to help grow the business.
So you got burned
along the way, maybe,
learned some lessons--
which is a good thing.
Bad thing, to get burned
along the way--
It doesn't matter
how many times you fail.
You just have to be right
one time.
At what percentage
of your sales is 7-Eleven?
About 95%.
Ohh!
Doesn't it scare
the Sweet Ballz off you
that you have 95% of your sales
with one retailer?
It's a great point,
and we've--We've been
making strides and working--
We just got a-another P.O.
Not only are we in
the largest convenience store,
but we're also in
the largest distributor--
The two largest distributors
set up.
(Robert) Cole, on the million
in sales you'll do this year,
will you make a profit?
We've made $95,000
to date.
Okay, James, things--Things
are going great for you.
Why are you here?
Because for us,
it's about growth.
Right now one of the things
we have is a 21-Day turnaround.
The $250,000 would be used
to offset
some of our inventory needs
so that we could get away
from that 21-day lead time,
'cause some of the retailers
that we've talked to right now
want to be able to turn it
faster than 21 days.
So you're asking for $250,000
for 25%?
For 10% of the company.
(laughter)
(Kevin) Yeah--
Here's what's wrong
with the 10%--
Nobody gets excited
about 10%.
Understood.
Nobody's interested in 10%.
What, uh... what would
get you interested?
Oh, big numbers. 80%, 90%.
(laughing)
Oh, yeah.
That works for me, too.
Is that your offer, Barbara?
$250,000 for 90%?
(Lori) 90%?
Hey, I'll give you an offer.
I'll give you $250,000
for 40%.
Ba-Bam!
Okay.
Thank you for the offer, too.
(laughs)
(Robert)
Ah, very nice, James.
Well, it's not--You know,
not saying it's, you know,
directly no, but thank you
for the offer.
Do you guys want
to consult on that?
Well...
(laughter)
Or the--hopefully
there's, uh,
at least one other offer
out there.
Have you paid yourself
anything?
Uh, we have.
We've taken a distribution.
How big is your distribution?
Uh, amounts to roughly
$2,500, $3,000 a month.
(Kevin) I like it,
'cause it's close to a space
I'm very involved in now,
particularly the commercial
kitchen logistics side.
Wicked Good Cupcakes--
We're making a lot of money
in that company.
I'll do the $250,000 for 30%,
but here is the covenant
that I'm gonna put on it,
because I'm concerned in all
the food deals I've ever done
in getting my capital back
before I die.
Sure.
So when you make
a distribution,
I get one, too--
Dollar for dollar.
So I'm just like a partner
that started at the top,
except I paid a whole lot more
for it.
We-We'd like to also know,
like, which retailer
you--You have
relationships at
that you could also help us
get into.
I can call any retailer
and get my call returned.
Well, that's not necessarily so.
What I--what I've learned--
what I've learned
about this business--
That's not always true
of him.
What I've learned about
this business--
"Hi, it's Kevin O'Leary."
Click.
(chuckles)
I like Kevin's offer...
except--
There's one problem.
You don't like Kevin.
(laughs)
I like Kevin a lot.
Well, I don't like Kevin,
so I'll just admit it.
I like Kevin's offer,
but I'm going to change it
a little bit.
Okay.
$250,000 for 36%
and the same distribution
that Kevin offered.
But I'm bringing with me
not only retail,
which I'm known
for lightning speed...
absolutely.
But I also bring with me qvc.
And...
I've got good news for you.
I'll keep my offer--
I can do hundreds
of thousands of dollars
in minutes.
Right.
We'll call in, and they will--
anybody that's got a product
that can sell...
You know what?
Can sell it on qvc.
I would agree with that.
Yes, and you know how many
people last?
Very few.
I will tell you--
to survive on qvc
is a very tricky thing.
You have to really
know what you're doing.
Mm-hmm.
As Barbara will attest to.
I'll attest to it, but let me
tell you something.
It's only in adjunct sales.
Right.
It's not the main deal.
Sure.
You've got the main deal.
It's free advertising
and great sales.
It's free advertising,
and the theory is,
is that it drives other sales,
and I have found
in testing that theory
there's no truth to it.
Oh, that's not True at all.
James, when you have Lori
and Barbara on the panel...
Wait, wait, wait.
I c--
You can't get a word in
edgewise.
(laughter)
So, James, I'll give you
the $250,000 for 25%.
And I-I don't need a royalty
or anything along the way.
I mean, my gosh,
you've done a million dollars
in your first year in sales.
Let me come along
for that ride.
Okay.
Thank you.
Robert, and I'm sure
you bring a retailer
to the table as well, from--
I can certainly bring costco,
but, you know, frankly,
I'm sure everybody here could.
But I'm not investing
in my retail strategy.
(James) Mm-hmm.
I'm investing
in the two of you guys.
Mm-hmm.
(Lori) You need a shark
that knows how to keep you
in the retailer.
Because it's--We can get in,
we can break down the door.
Some of us, I think
more doors than others.
Don't sell yourself short.
But--No.
(Lori) I think
some more than others.
But you also have to think
about who--What strategic
partner do you want.
(lowered voice)
I like these guys,
but I don't know the cake
and Candy business like you do.
Is it somebody who has
a lot of experience,
creativity, can get you
into a lot of stores?
You're making me blush.
Stop.
No, I mean--
(laughter)
You know, you have to think
about it in your gut.
Sure.
Well, let me ask one question.
Mark...
um, is there a potential
for an offer on the table?
Yeah, I'm interested.
I think I'd rather have
a strategic partner with me...
sure.
Than do it on my own.
So I'd like to work
with Barbara.
Um, I like
Barbara's experience there.
Barbara, you had some ideas
on what you wanted to do,
so fire away.
Yeah, I had offered you 40%,
and I obviously know
I've been out-Priced here.
I'm gonna adjust my offer,
but I have a feeling
that I'm working with
a generous partner here,
and I'm afraid--
and so keep your mouth shut.
I always pay--they say I overpay
all the time.
Keep your mouth shut.
What are you gonna say?
He overpays, all right?
I'll adjust the offer
to 33%,
because the truth
of the matter is--
That's not what we discussed.
The offer is 25%. Right?
Thirty--
Wait, wait, wait.
No, we didn't agree on 25%.
Yes, we did. Yes, we did.
No, we didn't.
I said I'd think about it.
Whoa. You--
do you want two partners
can't even agree
on the offer?
He just
thought about it.
Think about it.
(Barbara)
No, I didn't want to do that.
(Mark) You didn't want
to do 25%?
This is really interesting.
(Barbara) No. All right, 30%,
all right.
I'm going along with him
'cause he's so damn pushy.
Okay, I'll agree to $250,000
for your 25%.
(Robert) 25%. So you've got
an offer from Barbara and mark
for $250,000 for 25%,
so would you agree with me
there's value
in having more than one shark
in the deal?
Absolutely.
Yes.
All right, well, what if you
had three sharks
with the same offer?
