I'm in Italy.
I wanna send a postcard.
I go to my phone.
Mm-hmm.
I capture a picture.
Correct.
I send it.
Walk me through what happens
on the back end now.
So--
How does that get mailed?
Sure. You're in Italy.
You take the picture.
You write the simple note.
You change the color,
change the font.
Okay.
You sign it with your finger,
right?
Then it brings you
to your address book, right?
Right. That was one
of my questions.
I don't think I have
any physical addresses.
That's right.
We built a product
called postal gopher,
which is our patent pending
address retrieval technology
that allows the user to send
a postcard to somebody
with only having
their e-Mail or cell.
My system alerts you,
I'm Lynnae Schneller...
Lynnae's not kidding
when she says
it's a secret family recipe.
I had to wait seven years
to be married into the family
before learning the recipe.
(Lynnae, singsongy)
Who wants a pickle?
Come try a sample.
(Lynnae) Our pickles
are unlike any pickle
you've ever tried before.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Lynnae Schneller...
Aly, there's--There's no doubt
you guys have done a great job.
But $7 for a jar of pickles?
Yeah--
can I just reiterate
that the average range
is $5.99 to $9.99
for any specialty pickle?
So I'm croatian.
Croatians love pickles.
But very rare that they eat
sweet pickles.
I'm--I'm not the right investor.
I'm out.
All right, thank you.
Barbara.
(sighs)
Couple of things.
I think $144,000 in sales in
your first year is phenomenal.
There are very few
young entrepreneurs
that can make that claim.
So you don't need
any help here.
You're well on your road
to success,
(Aly) I think their comments
were very constructive.
