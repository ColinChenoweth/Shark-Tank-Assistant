I'm in Italy.
I wanna send a postcard.
I go to my phone.
Mm-hmm.
I capture a picture.
Correct.
I send it.
Walk me through what happens
on the back end now.
So--
How does that get mailed?
Sure. You're in Italy.
You take the picture.
You write the simple note.
You change the color,
change the font.
Okay.
You sign it with your finger,
right?
Then it brings you
to your address book, right?
Right. That was one
of my questions.
I don't think I have
any physical addresses.
That's right.
We built a product
called postal gopher,
which is our patent pending
address retrieval technology
that allows the user to send
a postcard to somebody
with only having
their e-Mail or cell.
My system alerts you,
I'm Lynnae Schneller...
and I'm Aly Cullinane.
(both) And we're from
Tacoma, Washington.
(singsongy) Good morning, girls.
It's pickle time.
Whoo!
(laughter)
We run a gourmet,
high-end pickle business
based on
my great-grandma Toots'
100-year-old
secret family recipe.
Girls.
Lynnae's not kidding
when she says
it's a secret family recipe.
I had to wait seven years
to be married into the family
before learning the recipe.
(women shouting at once
and laughing)
(Lynnae, singsongy)
Who wants a pickle?
Come try a sample.
(Lynnae) Our pickles
are unlike any pickle
you've ever tried before.
They're crunchy, delicious,
and absolutely addicting.
This week we have three P.O.S
that we need to get ready
to put out.
Okay.
We need the sharks because
we need additional capital
in order to feed the growing
demand of our business.
We've risked everything
to start our business.
We quit our jobs
and put our careers on the line.
To grandma Toots.
(all) To grandma Toots!
We know that great-grandma toots
is looking down,
just so proud that
we're not only carrying on
our family tradition,
but we're bringing her recipe
to the world.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Lynnae Schneller...
and my name is
Aly Cullinane.
And our company is
Lynnae's Gourmet Pickles.
We are seeking $125,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company.
We're sure you're all aware
that specialty food
is among the fastest-growing
industries in the U.S.
There is, however,
an unfulfilled niche
in specialty...
(both) pickles!
(chuckles)
After launching
in September 2011,
we had quick success,
and we're selling pickles
faster than we can make them.
Sharks, with all the uproar
we've caused,
we've got ourselves in a pickle
and need your help to feed
our increasing demand.
Lynnae is handing out
our two signature flavors.
They are Mrs. Pickles...
(Robert) Thank you.
Our original
sweet and sour dill,
and Hot Mama,
a sweet and sour dill...
Oh, thank you.
With a kick of jalapeño.
And did you tell us
what your sales were?
In the last 12 months,
they're $144,000,
which is 36,000 jars
of pickles.
Wow.
What does a jar cost?
Suggested retail price
is $6.99.
And what do you sell them
wholesale for?
Average--$4.
And what's your cost?
(Lori) and what does
it cost you to make?
Our cost is $1--
Our cost is $1.93.
So right now we have stores
that want our product.
We just don't have the money
to produce the inventory.
For inventory and producing,
yeah.
And where have you sold them?
We actually are available
in 26 states
and about 200 locations.
Amazing.
Yeah, but--
do you sell them yourself?
(Robert)
are you using a distributor?
We do.
We are using a distributor.
We're signed on with the largest
specialty food distributor
in the U.S.
You know, you're--
You're in a classic
entrepreneur's dilemma, right?
Yeah.
Because you don't
have enough inventory
to grow with the company, so--
but it's a good dilemma
to have.
(Lynnae and Aly) Yeah.
It's a good problem to have,
right?
But what I'm saying is
in order for us to invest,
we have to see beyond that.
Do you have anything
that's so differentiated,
people are gonna say,
"Wow"?
I wanna tell you
the answer for his question.
The differentiator
are the two of you.
What else do you do
to market the product
other than a fancy display?
We do really creative things.
We did the national pickle hunt
within our city last year
that was covered
both locally and nationally.
And that was your idea?
Yes.
Mm-hmm, and throughout the day,
there was little clues posted,
and whoever got there first
to find the jar
got a package worth
anywhere from $200 to $1,000.
The video footage
from the newscasts--
Literally people are running
down the streets of our city,
trying to find these jars,
and it was a huge success,
so we're planning
on doing that every year.
Chasing the big pickle.
(laughing)
Chasing the pickle, so...
look, we've seen food products,
but you've obviously
been very ambitious
and successful
in marketing this,
and I'm trying to figure out
how do I make money with this?
How do you scale the business?
We have--next month,
we have a meeting
with one of the largest
retailers in the U.S
because they just--
(Kevin) Who is that?
Target.
They came to us, though,
because they expanded
into grocery last year,
and now they want to expand
their specialty line.
That would be
a game-Changer for me.
(Lori) Yes.
If it works, then you're
in the big league.
I'm not sure you guys are gonna
be able to pull that off.
Our distribution channels
already deliver to Target.
I'm Target.
Tell me why
I should carry your pickles
over the other 20 other ones.
We really appeal to
a gourmet, high-end... market.
Is it reflected in your price?
Yeah, $6.99. Yeah.
Yeah, $6.99.
(Robert) is that--
the average--
How does that compare
to a normal pickle jar?
A normal pickle jar--
The average
is about $3, $3.50.
(Kevin) Wow.
But in specialty pickles--
Specialty pickles, though--
Twice.
Okay, ladies,
you just walked in
with huge risk.
$5.99, so it's $9.99.
Why would Target put a $7 jar in
when the market's at $3?
Because specialty food
has been growing by 22%
over the last several years.
You guys, I feel there are
a lot of competition
already out there.
I think you guys are wonderful,
but for me,
I don't like sweet pickles,
and I do have to like
whatever it is I invest in.
So I'm out on this one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Guys, I think you have
a nice little business.
I think you guys hustle,
which is great.
You're creative.
And the big guys
aren't paying attention to you
because you're $144,000
in sales.
You--You don't matter to them.
But as you grow,
and you will,
they'll start paying attention.
They'll make a decision.
"do I buy them?"
you're not big enough.
"do I crush them
by just putting out
a comparable product?"
probably, and for that reason,
I'm out.
We know that
with any type of food,
there really is never
anything proprietary
Because someone Can create
something similar,
so our plan is to explode
into the market
and gain as much distribution
as we can,
and we do actually have interest
from several large--
Large stores.
No one's beating you up yet
because you're--You're so nice,
but now it's my chance
to do that, so I'm going to.
You're not worth over $600,000.
I don't think you can sell this
stuff at target at 7 bucks.
That's my personal opinion.
And the other issue for me
is do I want pickles
in my portfolio?
That's what I've been debating.
(Mark laughs)
And I don't think
the answer's "yes" to that,
so I'm out.
Any other questions or concerns
we can address for you?
I think you have two sharks
still left,
and Barbara's a sucker
for people selling food
in funny dresses.
I'm not a sucker at all.
I'm a sucker for
a great entrepreneur,
which obviously you both are.
Well, here's--
Here's what happens here.
We started with
great-Grandma's secret recipe,
and that was the passion
that started this business.
No food background.
No food background.
We've grown so much
in the past two years.
Our potential is unlimited.
Aly, there's--There's no doubt
you guys have done a great job.
But $7 for a jar of pickles?
Yeah--
can I just reiterate
that the average range
is $5.99 to $9.99
for any specialty pickle?
So I'm croatian.
Croatians love pickles.
But very rare that they eat
sweet pickles.
I'm--I'm not the right investor.
I'm out.
All right, thank you.
Barbara.
(sighs)
Couple of things.
I think $144,000 in sales in
your first year is phenomenal.
There are very few
young entrepreneurs
that can make that claim.
So you don't need
any help here.
You're well on your road
to success,
and you regret selling
your chunk of your business
five years from now.
I almost made that mistake once
selling half my business
for $80,000, and thank god
that Investor changed his mind,
'cause I sold it for $66 million
5 years later.
I don't think you need
a partner, so I'm out.
Great. Thank you.
(Aly) I think their comments
were very constructive.
We're gonna take everything
they said and really
think about
all their suggestions
and figure out, like, what
makes sense for our business.
