Hi. I'm Dr. Amini.
And I'm Dr. Amini.
We're brothers,
and we're both physicians.
I'm Richard.
And I'm Albert.
(laughs)
Our company's Rolodoc,
and we're seeking
$50,000 for 20% of our company.
And as physicians,
we're constantly communicating
with our peers, our patients,
and with other
medical professionals.
And what we've realized
is that when it comes
to communication,
medicine is not
in the 21st century.
I mean, for crying out loud,
we're still using pagers
to communicate.
What is this, the '80s?
Rolodoc is the cure
for the old school communication
that exists in medicine.
Rolodoc allows for secure
e-mail between patients,
physicians,
and other medical professionals.
The mobile app allows for
instant messaging between them.
Take a look at this
sample patient profile.
Here's Mr. Wonderful's page.
He's entered in his information,
including his medical problems.
He looks good.
It looks like he's suffering
from a heart condition--
Acardia.
(laughs)
For those non-medical nerds,
this is a condition
when a person is literally born
without a heart.
Not to worry, Mr. Wonderful,
because you can then search
for physician by state,
specialty, or insurance
provider. Let's pick surgery.
Choosing surgery in Arizona
lets you find
this young,
good-looking surgeon.
You can then view his profile
and send him a message.
The surgeon receives
the message Instantly
and can reply
at his convenience.
Sharks, with your investment,
we will revolutionize the way
we communicate in medicine,
but most importantly, you'll
help us get rid of these pagers
and make some money
doing it.
Is the point that you can
personally communicate
to the doctors
that you have online?
Because doctors
Could be inundated
with e-Mails
and personal messages.
How would they ever
keep up with it?
What we're really trying to do
is bring social media
and the social network
to the medical profession.
What's the social element?
You didn't really say.
So... you--Let's say--
Let's say
Kevin O'Leary moves to L.A.,
wants to find a plastic surgeon
there,
get even sexier than he is
already.
I don't need that.
I look fantastic.
(laughter)
(Albert) even sexier.
I'm gonna have a heart attack
listening to that nonsense.
If he wants to go
find a doctor right now,
he's gonna do a search engine.
He's gonna be inundated
with inaccurate information,
and he's really gonna be--
end up just as confused
as when he started.
Are you up and running
at all?
We--we are in alpha testing
right now.
We've got 50 users on it--
Our personal connections
that are using it,
verifying how it works,
how the--
50 doctors
or just total users?
Total users.
(Kevin) I'm just looking
at my own situation.
My doctor's in Boston.
When I have aches and pains
and I'm on the road,
I can e-mail him as I do.
He communicates back to me
that way
and suggests that I go see
a specialist when I get home,
all done by e-mail.
The organization in Boston
which has my medical files
shares them amongst hospitals.
We've got that technology now.
So when I arrive
at the specialist,
they have all my history.
They know who I am.
What are you adding
to that equation?
So we're adding social media.
Doctors wanna brand themselves,
wanna advertise.
Just like you create a profile
on Rolodoc
and create a profile
on another social network,
but those social networks
aren't safe.
You can't--You don't--
(Mark) Okay, wait.
Take a step back.
How am I gonna convince you,
the physician,
to put your profile up there
and detail
the services that you offer?
Well, that's easy. There's
800,000 U.S. Physicians--
No, I didn't ask
what the market was.
Okay.
There's a hundred places
to put profiles.
What are you going to do
to convince doctors...
just like you have
business connections,
we have medical connections.
We're gonna launch in Arizona,
texas, and chicago. Those are
where all our connections are.
Doing what? Doing what?
We--we have access
to multiple doctors,
multiple databases.
We're gonna tell 'em
that this is the best way
to brand yourself
in advertising.
How are you going to
tell them?
I'm pulling teeth.
I should be a dentist.
Are you personally--
You're gonna quit your practice,
you're gonna stop doing surgery,
and you're gonna make the call?
No, this day and age,
we can do it with electronics.
We can e-Mail--
(Lori) You can--
buy a database?
You know what, mark, though?
And send an e-Mail?
This is dangerous. How are you
vetting these doctors?
It's a valid concern, 'cause
you don't wanna be reading
about somebody that actually
isn't a surgeon...
right.
That's offering heart surgery.
That would be a bad outcome.
Absolutely.
I don't think they're
gonna get anybody.
It's not gonna be dangerous
if you can't get any doctors.
Okay, let's go through
the logical progression.
Yeah.
My doctor gets an e-mail.
"Oh, it's from Rolodoc!"
"Never heard of 'em."
Delete.
(Kevin) Wait a second.
You haven't explained
how I make money,
which is
the most important thing.
My doctor is very hip
to technology.
Why would he use this,
and how would I profit
from him actually
getting on board?
He's gonna use this
'cause he's gonna want
to attract new Patients,
provide social media
to the medical field--
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
You guys are driving me nuts.
Wait. Let him answer!
How do I make money?
No, but he keeps on saying
"Social media, social media."
This is all one-to-One
communication.
You're not gonna let him
tell me how I make money.
'cause there's no chance
of you making money on this.
Do--is that the answer?
Targeted advertising is how
you're gonna make your money.
Within a secure environment,
you're gonna do
targeted Advertising?
Uh, not gonna happen.
Well, you can de--
Look, there are social networks
that are already doing this
for physician-only mobile--
Mobile networks.
Within just
physician-to-physician...
correct.
Which has a whole different
set of security issues
than communicating
with patients.
Correct.
But you can target
the physicians.
I see this as
a liability nightmare.
Because you are putting
people in touch
with their doctors.
They're answering back without
maybe seeing a patient,
knowing what's going on.
This is just my opinion.
There's a lot of risk in it.
I'm out.
What we're trying to do
is we're trying to bring
social media to medicine.
And you--
Albert, let me go back
to mark's point.
The current social network--
You keep saying
"Social Media"...
Yeah.
Then you go to e-mail.
E-mail is not social media.
Doctors are constantly
posting things
on twitter
and on other web sites.
And how do you use that?
Well, that's what we have.
We have the capability
of being a social network.
Instead of saying,
"Follow me on x-x site,"
you say,
"Follow me on Rolodoc."
I get that you're trying
to recreate twitter
and facebook on to Rolodoc.
Correct.
Okay, but I want to do this
eye-to-eye, face-to-face,
'cause you're doctors.
Worst presentation ever.
I'm out.
(Robert) Oh, that was mean.
Ever. You guys should be
smart enough to know.
You didn't show us
any of the social media.
You showed us profiles
and talked to us about e-mail.
You didn't tell us at all
how you were gonna get there.
It was horrible.
(Robert) Mark, I just think
you're being a bully.
I mean, they might be
misguided--
Okay, I am being a bully.
Then they deserve
to be bullied.
(Barbara) It's hurtful
to watch you.
I would have to agree with mark.
I think it was the worst
sales presentation I've heard.
We're not presenters, okay?
We're physicians, so--
But guess what.
I don't care
what your background is.
If you're looking for money,
you got to sell your idea.
That business plan
is so unclear,
I'm out.
(Robert) With all due respect,
I just don't think
you've explained
how you're gonna get users,
how you're gonna monetize it.
I just don't see the business.
I'm out.
(Kevin) I was intrigued.
Frankly, it's depressing,
'cause I like new ideas
in the medical space.
They're forever if they work.
But at the end of the day,
I can't connect the dots
regarding how I make money.
I'm out.
Fair enough. Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you, all.
