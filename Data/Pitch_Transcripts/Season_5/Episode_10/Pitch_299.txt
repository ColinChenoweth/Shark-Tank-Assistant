of the Nba's Dallas mavericks.
First into the tank is a couple
  from san Ramon, california,
with a better solution
  to a school-Day dilemma.
Melissa, you've sold
  a million dollars. Unbelievable.
How do people
  even know you're out there?
Social networking.
We have never paid a dollar
  for any marketing.
Not one?
What -- what -- What -- social
  marketing are you doing?
Facebook, twitter.
  Okay,
  so you're on facebook.
How many followers
  do you have?
Um, almost 34,000.
  What else are you using?
'cause 34,000 followers
  isn't going to translate
into a million in sales.
Just blogs.
This picture right here
  of my legs
was actually --
  Pinterest 2012,
it was one of their
  number-One pinned items.
Wow. That's a big deal.
  Really?
  Really?
Ah, there you go.
  Wow.
What is that made out of?
It's cotton.
  It's delicious.
Very --
  It feels
  almost like cashmere.
How much does this beautiful
  set of socks sell for?
$34.
  You're kidding.
What does it cost you
  to make the same pair of socks?
That one right there
  costs $5.
Amazing.
O'Leary:
  I'm Loving you.
What -- What did you make in
  2012 with $800,000 in Sales?
Yeah, your margins
  must be incredible.
What was the profit?
  What was the profit?
Over $300,000.
He's giving you
  exactly what you want.
  Yeah, Rick. I-I don't --
I don't need Barbara
  on the deal.
  Rick: Okay.
But, Melissa, hang on.
You came in asking
  for $175,000 for 10%.
I just offered you
  exactly what you're asking for.
What are we going to do?
Can we hear from
  the last shark
that's been staring a hole
  through us...
[ Laughter ]
  ...real Quick?
Rick, hang on.
I don't think
  it's fair to me
for you to say,
"Offer us
  exactly what we're asking for,
but let me see
  what the other guy has to say."
Of course he has
  that right.
  So for all due respect...
yes.
...I'd like an answer
  to my offer.
Rick, I gave you
  exactly what you're asking for.
You guys, you could
  lose this offer.
  Rick, I'm -- I'm --
  I'm out.
O'Leary: Oh!
  [ groans ]
you know why I like that?
Because your options
  are lessened.
Rick: Thank you, guys.
  Best of luck to you.
  Melissa: Thank you, guys.
Greiner: Congratulations.
  Good luck in retail.
Whew!
  Can you believe it?
Holy cow!
Melissa:
  I think Barbara just has
the same kind of type
  of thinking that we do,
