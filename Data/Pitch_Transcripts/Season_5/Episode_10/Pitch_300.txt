Cyndi: Barbara.
  Corcoran: Ah! Great.
PAUL: So, you'll notice
  there's no hinges.
There's no zippers
  to break.
Paul, I think it's very clever,
  'cause they get filthy.
That's what I think is
  so smart about it.
Right.
  Right.
  They get gross.
Great presentation,
  great name, great design.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
I got to believe that
  you're now at the cusp
  of going to retail,
'cause you know
  you got to get it there.
  Absolutely, absolutely.
  Absolutely.
I think most Moms Buy
  lunch boxes
Corcoran: Cyndi, what does
  a typical lunch box sell for?
$15, $20.
So, how long have you been
  selling? How many have you sold?
We've been on the market
  for four years.
This year, we're on track
  to do about
Cyndi, let me tell you
  what I object to on this.
This is rather large,
so I could not put this
  in her backpack.
It wouldn't fit.
  Okay.
Paul: Unfortunately,
  that type of a royalty
is probably unsustainable.
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 30%.
You realize he just cut
  your valuation in half?
I think we're gonna make it.
I think this is
  a real home run.
This is a time to make
  a decision. What do you say?
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
  whoa, whoa, whoa.
  Well, let me put a little
  pressure on Robert for you.
I can -- I might be able
  to squeeze him out.
  May I just ask you
  one question?
Herjavec: What do you say?
  What do you say?
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.
Narrator:
  Two sharks are out.
I would give you
  a similar deal.
  Cyndi: Okay.
$150,000 for 15%.
But you have to pay me back
  the 150k
within the first 15 months.
I just saved you
  $265,000.
[ laughs ]
  That's what happened
  there.
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.
I don't need
  the money back.
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 15% --
Exactly
  what you asked for.
What I can do for you
  is take you to retail
Let me put some more pressure
  on everybody.
  Paul, I gave you exactly --
Let me put
  some more pressure on,
'cause I saved you
  a ton of money.
  I'm gonna say
  one last thing.
People can throw money
  at you all day long.
  Paul, I gave you exactly
  what you're looking for today.
Paul: Yes.
  But if they don't know
  what to do with it,
then it's really
  not very valuable.
Well, Robert,
  can I ask you?
Lori gave some examples
  of already being in Disney
PAUL:
  We really wanted Robert.
We were so excited
  when he loved the design.
It was fantastic.
You know, what you
  need, I think, is you
  really need guidance
to -- if you want
  to get to that size.
  I agree.
It's almost one of those
  that seems too good to be True,
but I'm gonna take you
  at your word on it.
I'll give you $175,000
  for the 10%.
Would you be interested
in having Barbara in
  on this deal with us?
I think she brings
  a lot to the table.
