of the Nba's Dallas mavericks.
First into the tank is a couple
  from san Ramon, california,
with a better solution
  to a school-Day dilemma.
We're Rick and Melissa hinnant
  from Austin, texas,
and we're here today to
  knock your socks off, literally.
Our company is
  grace &amp; lace,
and we're seeking $175,000
for a 10% equity stake
  in our company.
Grace &amp; lace
  has taken the Boring sock...
Boring!
...that women wear
  under their boots,
and we've turned it into a Lacy,
  frilly fashion statement.
Our story starts
  a couple of years ago.
I had an idea
  for a cute, little, Lacy sock
that stuck out
  of my boots.
So after about nine hours
  on the sewing machine
and a ton of frustration,
I finally made
  my first pair.
Everywhere I wore them,
people would stop me
  and ask me where I got them.
When I said I made them,
  literally, strangers would
give me their phone number,
  ask me to make them a pair.
So I threw up online
  to see if they'd sell.
They did, instantly.
Before we knew it,
  a business was born,
and we had
  an accidental company.
And Melissa's gonna show you
  some of our top Sellers.
Here. Mm-hmm.
  Thank you.
Thank you.
  Mm-hmm.
Really quite beautiful.
  Nicely done.
  Thank you.
Cuban: Thank you.
  Appreciate it.
O'Leary: What's your sales?
  Corcoran: What are your sales?
Our first calendar year,
  2012,
we did
  over $800,000 in sales.
Whoa!
  Wow!
  $800,000?
Our last 12 months
  to date,
we did $1.125 million
  in sales.
Hey!
  CORCORAN: You've got to be
  kidding me.
I'm not kidding you.
  Wow. That's very good.
I was going to ignore you
  completely, but now...
Yeah.
Are you selling them all
  online?
Um...
  90% of our sales
  are online.
Wow. Good for you.
  And August of last year
was our first launch
  into stores,
so we're now
  in over 230 stores.
Melissa, you've sold
  a million dollars. Unbelievable.
How do people
  even know you're out there?
Social networking.
We have never paid a dollar
  for any marketing.
Not one?
What -- what -- What -- social
  marketing are you doing?
Facebook, twitter.
  Okay,
  so you're on facebook.
How many followers
  do you have?
Um, almost 34,000.
  What else are you using?
'cause 34,000 followers
  isn't going to translate
into a million in sales.
Just blogs.
This picture right here
  of my legs
was actually --
  Pinterest 2012,
it was one of their
  number-One pinned items.
Wow. That's a big deal.
  Really?
  Really?
Ah, there you go.
  Wow.
What is that made out of?
It's cotton.
  It's delicious.
Very --
  It feels
  almost like cashmere.
How much does this beautiful
  set of socks sell for?
$34.
  You're kidding.
What does it cost you
  to make the same pair of socks?
That one right there
  costs $5.
Amazing.
O'Leary:
  I'm Loving you.
What -- What did you make in
  2012 with $800,000 in Sales?
Yeah, your margins
  must be incredible.
What was the profit?
  What was the profit?
Over $300,000.
I'm really happy for you,
  and I think that it's great
that you've made
  this incredible success.
I have to be honest, though.
It-- it did shock me.
  It still shocks me.
I'm glad you did it, but I
  can't relate to the product.
So for that reason,
  I'm out.
Herjavec: Look, the --
  the proof is in the money.
Convince me why you need
  $175,000 today.
[ sighs ] we need
  a strategic partner.
Two weeks into my business,
  after I sold my first pair,
we got an e-Mail
  from Nordstrom's asking
if I had the ability
  to make 30,000 to 50,000 pairs.
At that time, I didn't even know
  that I could make 20.
  That's ridic--
  There's no way.
You obviously don't need
  the money. What do you need?
Like I said, I think that
  we can grow this company
to $5 million
  to $10 million.
I think that we have
  the capability to do that.
But we're looking
  at you guys
to take us
  to $100 million plus.
It could be
  much bigger than that.
And that's
  what we're looking for,
is the strategic part
  more than anything.
Corcoran:
  I'd like to put an offer
  on the table, get it going,
'cause I think we have
  a lot of interest here.
I think
  your valuation is good.
I don't think you're greedy
  based on what your sales are.
So I'm willing to give you
  $87,500 for 5% of your business
if you get another shark
  in with me.
Okay.
  Okay. Thank you.
I'll give you $175,000
  for 20%.
It drops down to 10% as soon
  as you pay back the capital.
That assures me
  my capital comes out.
And I'm willing to put more
  back in if I have to.
Um...thank you
  for your offer.
I will consider that.
  Consider it. Yeah.
Who else is gonna step up?
I know you're thinking
  Pretty hard over there, Robert.
He's giving you
  exactly what you want.
  Yeah, Rick. I-I don't --
I don't need Barbara
  on the deal.
  Rick: Okay.
And that's a fair question
  they can ask.
But, Melissa, hang on.
You came in asking
  for $175,000 for 10%.
I just offered you
  exactly what you're asking for.
What are we going to do?
Can we hear from
  the last shark
that's been staring a hole
  through us...
[ Laughter ]
  ...real Quick?
Rick, hang on.
I don't think
  it's fair to me
for you to say,
"Offer us
  exactly what we're asking for,
but let me see
  what the other guy has to say."
Of course he has
  that right.
  So for all due respect...
yes.
...I'd like an answer
  to my offer.
And I absolutely want
  to respect you.
I also want to hear
  everything else.
And I think, you know,
  being a smart businessman,
you would understand that,
  as well.
Would you agree?
You -- You got to make
  a decision on my deal.
I mean, I'm --
  I'm happy to pull out...
sure.
  ...and let you deal
  with the other guys,
or I'm happy to
  have you take my deal.
  I'm just --
I'm just interested in
  hearing what is out there
so I can make the best educated
  decision for you and me.
Rick, I gave you
  exactly what you're asking for.
I understand.
  What is there left to decide?
In the Shark Tank, we call this
  bone-In-Mouth disease.
It's a dog looking
  into a pond with a
  bone in their mouth.
Kevin, I don't -- I don't need
  you to make it better or worse.
But I'm just telling you
  right now
it is bone-In-Mouth disease
  right here.
For the 10% -- Kevin, quiet!
  This is the dilemma
  of the Shark Tank.
I'm Loving the drama.
  I'm Loving it.
  Quiet!
It's $175,000 for 10%.
  It's what you asked for.
Can I ask you
  a few more questions?
Yes or no?
Narrator:
  One shark is out.
Barbara and Kevin
  have offers on the table,
but Robert
  has offered Rick and Melissa
exactly what they asked for --
  $175,000 for 10%.
Yes or No?
Can I ask you
  a few more questions?
I've given you
  exactly what you're asking for.
I'm a very nice guy,
but don't mistake my kindness
  for weakness.
Yes or no?
Greiner: You guys,
  this is a moment
that you don't want to
  walk away from and say, "uh-Oh."
$175,000 for 10%.
I-I'm happy to go out.
Can we discuss it outside?
You guys, you could
  lose this offer.
  Rick, I'm -- I'm --
  I'm out.
O'Leary: Oh!
  [ groans ]
you know why I like that?
Because your options
  are lessened.
And I would actually do the deal
  that I offered to you.
Cuban: Look, I like
  what you guys are doing.
Question is, where are you gonna
  need the most amount of help?
So when you
  did your projections --
$1 million, $5 million,
  $10 million, $100 million --
What were the pain points
  where you said,
"Oh, my goodness, how am I
  gonna get through this?"
that's what I want to know.
We're not looking to suck
  a ton of your time,
because we understand
  time is the only commodity
that we can't
  get more of.
  Amen.
So I'm looking to be able
  to call and say,
"Hey, you know,
  we're at the $5 million mark,
"and we are gonna expand
  this year to $10 million.
What should we be doing?"
Okay, I'll offer you
  $175,000 for 10%.
But I need to know right now
  yes or No.
Can we talk about it
  in the hallway?
Corcoran: Wow.
There's a difference
  between trying to gather
as much information as you can
  and indecision.
There are gonna be many
  times in the evolution
  of your business
where you can't be indecisive,
and right now
  you're demonstrating
that you're
  being indecisive.
Yeah, but we came in
  with a strategy,
and we knew
  who we wanted,
so it wasn't indecisive --
  Not at all.
I'm going to revise
  my offer.
I'm gonna change the offer
to give you exactly
  what you asked for,
but half of the money
  is going to be a line of credit.
Okay.
  So what's the answer?
The answer is We would love
  to do business with Barbara.
We think that she
  brings the most.
  O'Leary: Whoa.
You know what? You picked
  the smartest person here.
Good decision.
I think it was
  a very good decision.
  Thank you.
Thank you.
  Terrifically done.
  You were great under pressure.
Thank you.
  Terrific together.
We -- we came in with
  a plan, and sometimes
  it works out, right?
Herjavec: Nice job.
  O'Leary: Congratulations.
  Greiner: Good luck.
Rick: Thank you, guys.
  Best of luck to you.
  Melissa: Thank you, guys.
Greiner: Congratulations.
  Good luck in retail.
Whew!
  Can you believe it?
Holy cow!
We went with our gut,
  and it worked out,
with the exact partner
  that we wanted.
  Yeah.
Absolutely incredible.
  It couldn't have gone better.
We did it!
Melissa:
  I think Barbara just has
the same kind of type
  of thinking that we do,
and she just has
  that go-Get-'em attitude,
and I think that we'll just pair
  really well with her.
  Mm-hmm.
They were
  great negotiators.
  Well, they just do
  what they wanted.
They should have
  just asked for Barbara
is what
  they should have done.
  That's all right.
You know what?
  They were sharks wearing socks.
[ laughter ]
  I don't know
  if they were sharks.
Well said.
