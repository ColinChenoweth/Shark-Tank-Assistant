Hi, sharks.
  I'm Cyndi.
  And I'm Paul.
And we're here today seeking
  $150,000 investment
in exchange for 15%
  of our lunch-Box company, yubo.
[ bell rings ]
lunchtime!
  Lunchtime!
It all started
  four years ago.
As the proud parents
  of two beautiful, little girls,
we'd send them to school
with your typical
  fabric lunch box
filled with
  Those plastic baggies
and "Personalized" With a
  permanent Marker on the outside.
We were going through nearly
  2,000 plastic baggies a year,
not to mention
  these lunch boxes
would come home
  completely nasty.
They were
  not dishwasher-Safe,
so I would do my best
  to wipe it down.
And, oh,
  it was clean, right?
Wrong!
  Wrong!
[ Laughs ]
  We looked everywhere
for a lunch box that was easy to
  clean, good for the environment,
and we couldn't find it,
  so we created yubo.
Yubo is
  the only lunch box
Where kids can create
  their own designs
and change them out
  whenever their tastes change
so you don't have to buy
  a whole new lunch box.
You just pop in
  a new design.
You have
  a whole new look.
And if you spill yogurt
  or crumbs, it's not a problem.
Just rinse it out in the sink
  or throw it in the dishwasher.
Yubo comes with a set
  of reusable fruit containers
and a custom-Fit ice pack
  so food stays fresh.
We made you custom yubos.
All you do is --
  HERJAVEC: Oh, very cool.
See if you can
  recognize yourself.
Oh, oh!
  [ laughs ]
they're simple to open.
Just hold on the middle
  and grab on any corner.
  Thank you.
Cyndi: Barbara.
  Corcoran: Ah! Great.
And when you want
  to close it back up,
just push on All four corners --
  Super-Simple.
Cute, right?
So come on, sharks.
Let's do lunch!
  Let's do lunch!
[ Bell rings ]
Lunchtime's over, girls.
  [ laughter ]
PAUL: So, you'll notice
  there's no hinges.
There's no zippers
  to break.
Super-Simple.
  Open and close.
Great job.
Herjavec: Very clever.
  Thank you.
  Thank you.
Are these add-Ons,
  or do these come with it?
We have two models.
We have
  our basic lunch box,
which comes empty
  at a lower price point.
And what's that price point?
  This is -- $21.95.
And then we have
  our deluxe model
that comes with
  what you see there,
and that can retail
  anywhere from $30
for no personalization
  on it
or up to $40 when you want
  to personalize it.
When you think about something
  like this,
I mean, you think about how easy
  this is to come apart,
that's why this type of a design
  is so amazing.
You could take it apart
  and put it in the dishwasher.
  Exactly.
That -- That's one of the unique
  selling attributes.
Absolutely.
  Correct.
Paul, I think it's very clever,
  'cause they get filthy.
That's what I think is
  so smart about it.
Right.
  Right.
  They get gross.
Great presentation,
  great name, great design.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
I got to believe that
  you're now at the cusp
  of going to retail,
'cause you know
  you got to get it there.
  Absolutely, absolutely.
  Absolutely.
I think most Moms Buy
  lunch boxes
when they're walking down
  the aisle, see it, and say,
"Need a lunch box."
  Absolutely.
We have about 100 retail stores
  across the nation.
We also are sold
  internationally.
We have a handful
  of international distributors.
Corcoran: Cyndi, what does
  a typical lunch box sell for?
$15, $20.
So, how long have you been
  selling? How many have you sold?
We've been on the market
  for four years.
This year, we're on track
  to do about
between $200,000
  and $250,000.
  Wow.
Greiner: do you have a patent
  on this?
  We do. Two patents.
We own a design patent
  and a utility patent.
We own
  our yubo trademark.
And our vision
  for the company
not only is to expand in the
  channels that we're already in,
but I have another vision.
So, Barbara,
  I know you have a daughter.
Let's think back
  to when she was Younger
and you took her
to the happiest place on earth
  for the first time,
to the amusement park
  we all know.
She's filled
  with excitement.
She meets her favorite Princess
  for the very first time,
and somebody photographs
  that moment.
Imagine that photograph
  is waiting for her
on her lunch box
  in that gift shop.
  Mm.
Do you have that deal
  in place?
That's why we're here.
  We do not.
  We do not have that deal
  in place.
So...
  we would love to have that deal
  in place.
Did you design this yourself?
He and I came up with the idea
  together.
So, how much money
  did you have to put out?
We have invested in Total about
  $350,000 of our own money.
With our industrial designer,
  we didn't have the cash
to pay what he would naturally
  charge up front.
We had no sales.
  We had no product.
  Greiner:
  You gave him a piece.
We gave him a piece.
  Absolutely.
  Cuban: That's okay.
That's okay.
  How much did you give him?
  How much did you give him?
He owns 20% of our company.
  We own 80%.
And he has a royalty,
  to be clear.
Oh.
How much is the royalty?
  He has a 5% to 1%.
It's a sliding scale
  based on the units sold.
I think
  he's Kevin's cousin.
  Ah.
Yes.
  And is that in Perpetuity?
Uh, it is.
  It is.
So, when -- When would it
  drop down to 1%?
750,000 units.
But it's 5% of the cost
  of the unit.
It's 5% of sales.
Oh.
Net sales.
Net sales.
  Mm-hmm.
Wow.
  That's steep. Ooh.
We wouldn't be here today
  if we didn't do that,
so we're very satisfied
  with that deal.
Cuban:
  Guys, guys, I got to tell you,
this is such
  a competitive industry.
  Mm-hmm.
I mean,
  you said you invested 350k.
  Mm-hmm.
And your sales are nowhere
  near that.
Mm-hmm.
The idea
  of a perpetual royalty
I think is so wrong,
  I'm out.
Let me -- Let me just stop you
  right there.
So, mark --
  You can't stop him
  if he's out.
Cyndi, let me tell you
  what I object to on this.
This is rather large,
so I could not put this
  in her backpack.
It wouldn't fit.
  Okay.
And I find that to be
  a problem.
  Okay.
I think
  it's a charming product.
I love the personalization
  of it.
But it's too big.
  I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
  I understand.
Let me throw an offer at you,
  because I'm -- I'm interested.
There's a fair amount of work
  that has to happen here
to pull it into retail,
where 90% of the boxes
  are bought,
where I bought mine
  my whole life with my kids.
And I think I can help there
  in a lot of ways.
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 10% equity in your company.
Plus, I want the same royalty
  deal that your designer has --
5% sliding down to 1%
  based on sales volumes.
Paul: Unfortunately,
  that type of a royalty
is probably unsustainable.
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 30%.
You realize he just cut
  your valuation in half?
I think we're gonna make it.
I think this is
  a real home run.
This is a time to make
  a decision. What do you say?
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
  whoa, whoa, whoa.
  Well, let me put a little
  pressure on Robert for you.
I can -- I might be able
  to squeeze him out.
  May I just ask you
  one question?
Herjavec: What do you say?
  What do you say?
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.
Narrator:
  Two sharks are out.
Paul and Cyndi
  have two offers --
One from Kevin,
  who is offering $150,000
for a 10% stake
plus a sliding 5% to 1% royalty
based on sales.
Robert is offering $150,000
for a 30% stake.
But Lori may also want to bite.
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.
  [ laughter ]
great.
  We'd love to hear it.
I'm gonna offer you
  the 150k...
...for 20%.
And I'm already in Disney.
I also have a relationship
  with walmart.
Herjavec: I think we can all
  get you into Disney.
I believe
  in the product.
Robert's at 30% equity.
  Lori's at 20%.
You basically told me
you're not gonna look at my
  offer with a royalty, correct?
Right.
  That's fair.
All right, so,
  I'll give you the $150,000.
I'm gonna set a ratchet --
  I'm gonna go at 20%,
but you can buy me
  all the way back down to 12.5%
if you pay me back my $150,000
  in 18 months.
What if they don't?
I stay at 20%.
It's like
  a roulette wheel.
I would give you
  a similar deal.
  Cyndi: Okay.
$150,000 for 15%.
But you have to pay me back
  the 150k
within the first 15 months.
I just saved you
  $265,000.
[ laughs ]
  That's what happened
  there.
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.
I don't need
  the money back.
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 15% --
Exactly
  what you asked for.
What I can do for you
  is take you to retail
and help you
  go through Disney.
You don't have to pay me back
  in 15 months.
I'm not
  a loan tank kind of guy.
  [ both laugh ]
I think there's
  lots of talk.
  O'Leary:
  Wait, wait, wait.
Let me put some more pressure
  on everybody.
  Paul, I gave you exactly --
Let me put
  some more pressure on,
'cause I saved you
  a ton of money.
  I'm gonna say
  one last thing.
People can throw money
  at you all day long.
  Paul, I gave you exactly
  what you're looking for today.
Paul: Yes.
  But if they don't know
  what to do with it,
then it's really
  not very valuable.
Well, Robert,
  can I ask you?
Lori gave some examples
  of already being in Disney
and having a relationship
  with walmart.
  Cuban: Let me -- on --
  on Disney -- Let me --
Yeah, but you're not even
  on this.
  Not to jump on Robert.
  I'm just gonna educate them.
People from Disney come in,
  and they say,
"All the products that you guys
  invested in 'Shark Tank' --
We'd love to find
  a way to get them in Disney."
  To all of us.
And they've just got to
  go through a process.
  But why is there only one
  that's in Disney now
and "Shark Tank's" Been on
  for so many years?
  Because different --
Because different products
  have different types --
Because different products
  have different test terms.
  No, it's because
you have to know
  how to operate.
  We've got products there.
No, no, come on.
  And I knew
  how to make it happen,
because I've been in retail
  for 17 years.
I am the one here
  out of your choices --
You know, before we go on
  with half an hour of this...
I'm just gonna put a little more
  pressure on it all,
just 'cause I'm having fun.
I'm gonna reduce my equity --
  In other words,
if you do pay me back in
  the 18 months that I suggested,
I'll drop it down to 10%.
So I'm gonna be 20%
  down to 10%.
I'm the lowest
  of them all now.
I would like you
  to tell me
whether or not you're going to
  take my offer now.
Hmm.
You won't allow us
  to step out in the hallway
for just a moment?
  Just step out
  for just a minute?
The problem is sometimes
  when you walk out,
things change in here,
  right?
  O'Leary: Right.
Mm-hmm. True.
You never know.
  They're choppy waters.
Would any of you
  be willing to team up?
Yeah, I'll go in
  with Kevin's deal.
I think there is a value
  in having more sharks.
$150,000 for --
  okay.
It's 20%, but if they
  pay it back in 18 months,
it drops to 10%.
  Greiner: drops to 10%.
Those are your options.
  What are you going to do?
Robert,
  Mr. Wonderful...
I think we've got a deal.
  ...I think we have a deal!
O'Leary: All right.
  Whoo!
All right!
CUBAN: Congrats, guys.
  Herjavec: That was awesome.
This actually is
  the best financial deal for you.
  It's a great product.
Thank you all so much.
Greiner: Good luck.
  Thank you.
Yay!
Yay! Good job!
I'm so excited!
  Oh!
PAUL:
  We really wanted Robert.
We were so excited
  when he loved the design.
It was fantastic.
And to get Mr. Wonderful
  in there, as well,
helping us grow the business,
  could not have asked for more.
I think we just stick with
  this design.
  Yeah.
I think every kid
  should see this in the morning.
They're gonna have nightmares
  every night about it.
Narrator: Last season,
Marc newburger and Jeffrey Simon
  made a deal
with Lori Greiner for their
  car-Safety product, drop stop.
Drop Stop
  reduces driver distraction
by keeping your eyes
  on the road, not in your gap.
The built-In slot
  is designed
to fit easily around
  the seat-Belt catch like so.
You won't even know it's there
  till it stops the drop.
We can make a lot of money
  together,
but we can also save
  a lot of lives together.
Let's see how Marc and Jeffrey
  are doing now.
Since appearing
  on "Shark Tank,"
we have sold hundreds
  of thousands of drop stops.
And that's not just sales
  for us.
That is
  lots of jobs created.
Simon: In the short five months
  since we aired,
we have grossed
  over $5 million in sales.
In the next 12 months,
we project
  over $15 million in sales.
And Lori just landed us
  our first National retail deal.
Greiner: [ gasps ]
Oh, my.
  Oh, my gosh!
  Oh, my god!
[ laughing ]
  Oh, my god!
Not only
  did we get into walmart,
but we got
  into 3,500 walmarts.
That was an order
  valued at $2 million.
What a dream come True.
  My God.
This is unbelievable.
  Dream come True.
  Amazing.
We're going to take over
  the world,
and we're not gonna stop
  until every seat gap is filled.
We are going to make
  a ton of money together,
but we're also gonna help
  save lives.
She's the best partner
  we could have,
and we have
  just gotten started.
Whoo!
  Whoo!
  Whoo!
A few months ago,
  after appearing on "Shark Tank,"
We were honored to
  get an e-Mail from an
  OFFICER, David Gerlach,
and said drop Stop
  could really help
to reduce driver distraction
  for officers.
So that's why we came
  out here -- We wanted to
  donate a set of drop stops
to all 425 officers
  of this police department.
Literally, to be able
  to give something back
to the people who,
  every single day, risk
  their lives for us,
it's just truly
  a dream come True.
All:
  Don't drop and drive!
You know, what you
  need, I think, is you
  really need guidance
to -- if you want
  to get to that size.
  I agree.
It's almost one of those
  that seems too good to be True,
but I'm gonna take you
  at your word on it.
I'll give you $175,000
  for the 10%.
Would you be interested
in having Barbara in
  on this deal with us?
I think she brings
  a lot to the table.
