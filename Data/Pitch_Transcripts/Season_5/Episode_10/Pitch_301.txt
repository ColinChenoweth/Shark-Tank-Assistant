Narrator: And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
What I can do for you
  is take you to retail.
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.
What do you say?
  Can I ask you
  a few more questions?
Don't mistake my kindness
  for weakness.
Narrator:
  Who are the sharks?
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went from
  waiting tables in manhattan
to building the city's
  preeminent real-Estate empire.
Robert herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner, the queen of qvc,
  holds over 100 patents,
and has launched
  over 300 products
grossing over a half a billion
  dollars in retail sales.
And mark cuban -- Notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,
tech guru,
  and the outspoken owner
Hi, sharks.
  I'm Cyndi.
  And I'm Paul.
And we're here today seeking
  $150,000 investment
in exchange for 15%
  of our lunch-Box company, yubo.
[ bell rings ]
lunchtime!
  Lunchtime!
It all started
  four years ago.
As the proud parents
  of two beautiful, little girls,
we'd send them to school
with your typical
  fabric lunch box
filled with
  Those plastic baggies
and "Personalized" With a
  permanent Marker on the outside.
We were going through nearly
  2,000 plastic baggies a year,
not to mention
  these lunch boxes
would come home
  completely nasty.
They were
  not dishwasher-Safe,
so I would do my best
  to wipe it down.
And, oh,
  it was clean, right?
Wrong!
  Wrong!
[ Laughs ]
  We looked everywhere
for a lunch box that was easy to
  clean, good for the environment,
and we couldn't find it,
  so we created yubo.
Yubo is
  the only lunch box
Where kids can create
  their own designs
and change them out
  whenever their tastes change
so you don't have to buy
  a whole new lunch box.
You just pop in
  a new design.
You have
  a whole new look.
And if you spill yogurt
  or crumbs, it's not a problem.
Just rinse it out in the sink
  or throw it in the dishwasher.
Yubo comes with a set
  of reusable fruit containers
and a custom-Fit ice pack
  so food stays fresh.
We made you custom yubos.
All you do is --
  HERJAVEC: Oh, very cool.
See if you can
  recognize yourself.
Oh, oh!
  [ laughs ]
they're simple to open.
Just hold on the middle
  and grab on any corner.
  Thank you.
And when you want
  to close it back up,
just push on All four corners --
  Super-Simple.
Cute, right?
So come on, sharks.
Let's do lunch!
  Let's do lunch!
[ Bell rings ]
Lunchtime's over, girls.
  [ laughter ]
Super-Simple.
  Open and close.
Great job.
Herjavec: Very clever.
  Thank you.
  Thank you.
Are these add-Ons,
  or do these come with it?
We have two models.
We have
  our basic lunch box,
which comes empty
  at a lower price point.
And what's that price point?
  This is -- $21.95.
And then we have
  our deluxe model
that comes with
  what you see there,
and that can retail
  anywhere from $30
for no personalization
  on it
or up to $40 when you want
  to personalize it.
When you think about something
  like this,
I mean, you think about how easy
  this is to come apart,
that's why this type of a design
  is so amazing.
You could take it apart
  and put it in the dishwasher.
  Exactly.
That -- That's one of the unique
  selling attributes.
Absolutely.
  Correct.
when they're walking down
  the aisle, see it, and say,
"Need a lunch box."
  Absolutely.
We have about 100 retail stores
  across the nation.
We also are sold
  internationally.
We have a handful
  of international distributors.
between $200,000
  and $250,000.
  Wow.
Greiner: do you have a patent
  on this?
  We do. Two patents.
We own a design patent
  and a utility patent.
We own
  our yubo trademark.
And our vision
  for the company
not only is to expand in the
  channels that we're already in,
but I have another vision.
So, Barbara,
  I know you have a daughter.
Let's think back
  to when she was Younger
and you took her
to the happiest place on earth
  for the first time,
to the amusement park
  we all know.
She's filled
  with excitement.
She meets her favorite Princess
  for the very first time,
and somebody photographs
  that moment.
Imagine that photograph
  is waiting for her
on her lunch box
  in that gift shop.
  Mm.
Do you have that deal
  in place?
That's why we're here.
  We do not.
  We do not have that deal
  in place.
So...
  we would love to have that deal
  in place.
Did you design this yourself?
He and I came up with the idea
  together.
So, how much money
  did you have to put out?
We have invested in Total about
  $350,000 of our own money.
With our industrial designer,
  we didn't have the cash
to pay what he would naturally
  charge up front.
We had no sales.
  We had no product.
  Greiner:
  You gave him a piece.
We gave him a piece.
  Absolutely.
  Cuban: That's okay.
That's okay.
  How much did you give him?
  How much did you give him?
He owns 20% of our company.
  We own 80%.
And he has a royalty,
  to be clear.
Oh.
How much is the royalty?
  He has a 5% to 1%.
It's a sliding scale
  based on the units sold.
I think
  he's Kevin's cousin.
  Ah.
Yes.
  And is that in Perpetuity?
Uh, it is.
  It is.
So, when -- When would it
  drop down to 1%?
750,000 units.
But it's 5% of the cost
  of the unit.
It's 5% of sales.
Oh.
Net sales.
Net sales.
  Mm-hmm.
Wow.
  That's steep. Ooh.
We wouldn't be here today
  if we didn't do that,
so we're very satisfied
  with that deal.
Cuban:
  Guys, guys, I got to tell you,
this is such
  a competitive industry.
  Mm-hmm.
I mean,
  you said you invested 350k.
  Mm-hmm.
And your sales are nowhere
  near that.
Mm-hmm.
The idea
  of a perpetual royalty
I think is so wrong,
  I'm out.
Let me -- Let me just stop you
  right there.
So, mark --
  You can't stop him
  if he's out.
And I find that to be
  a problem.
  Okay.
I think
  it's a charming product.
I love the personalization
  of it.
But it's too big.
  I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
  I understand.
Let me throw an offer at you,
  because I'm -- I'm interested.
There's a fair amount of work
  that has to happen here
to pull it into retail,
where 90% of the boxes
  are bought,
where I bought mine
  my whole life with my kids.
And I think I can help there
  in a lot of ways.
I'll give you the $150,000
  for 10% equity in your company.
Plus, I want the same royalty
  deal that your designer has --
5% sliding down to 1%
  based on sales volumes.
Paul and Cyndi
  have two offers --
One from Kevin,
  who is offering $150,000
for a 10% stake
plus a sliding 5% to 1% royalty
based on sales.
Robert is offering $150,000
for a 30% stake.
But Lori may also want to bite.
Well, I'll make it
  even more interesting.
  [ laughter ]
great.
  We'd love to hear it.
I'm gonna offer you
  the 150k...
...for 20%.
And I'm already in Disney.
I also have a relationship
  with walmart.
Herjavec: I think we can all
  get you into Disney.
I believe
  in the product.
Robert's at 30% equity.
  Lori's at 20%.
You basically told me
you're not gonna look at my
  offer with a royalty, correct?
Right.
  That's fair.
All right, so,
  I'll give you the $150,000.
I'm gonna set a ratchet --
  I'm gonna go at 20%,
but you can buy me
  all the way back down to 12.5%
if you pay me back my $150,000
  in 18 months.
What if they don't?
I stay at 20%.
It's like
  a roulette wheel.
and help you
  go through Disney.
You don't have to pay me back
  in 15 months.
I'm not
  a loan tank kind of guy.
  [ both laugh ]
I think there's
  lots of talk.
  O'Leary:
  Wait, wait, wait.
and having a relationship
  with walmart.
  Cuban: Let me -- on --
  on Disney -- Let me --
Yeah, but you're not even
  on this.
  Not to jump on Robert.
  I'm just gonna educate them.
People from Disney come in,
  and they say,
"All the products that you guys
  invested in 'Shark Tank' --
We'd love to find
  a way to get them in Disney."
  To all of us.
And they've just got to
  go through a process.
  But why is there only one
  that's in Disney now
and "Shark Tank's" Been on
  for so many years?
  Because different --
Because different products
  have different types --
Because different products
  have different test terms.
  No, it's because
you have to know
  how to operate.
  We've got products there.
No, no, come on.
  And I knew
  how to make it happen,
because I've been in retail
  for 17 years.
I am the one here
  out of your choices --
You know, before we go on
  with half an hour of this...
I'm just gonna put a little more
  pressure on it all,
just 'cause I'm having fun.
I'm gonna reduce my equity --
  In other words,
if you do pay me back in
  the 18 months that I suggested,
I'll drop it down to 10%.
So I'm gonna be 20%
  down to 10%.
I'm the lowest
  of them all now.
I would like you
  to tell me
whether or not you're going to
  take my offer now.
Hmm.
You won't allow us
  to step out in the hallway
for just a moment?
  Just step out
  for just a minute?
The problem is sometimes
  when you walk out,
things change in here,
  right?
  O'Leary: Right.
Mm-hmm. True.
You never know.
  They're choppy waters.
Would any of you
  be willing to team up?
Yeah, I'll go in
  with Kevin's deal.
I think there is a value
  in having more sharks.
$150,000 for --
  okay.
It's 20%, but if they
  pay it back in 18 months,
it drops to 10%.
  Greiner: drops to 10%.
Those are your options.
  What are you going to do?
Robert,
  Mr. Wonderful...
I think we've got a deal.
  ...I think we have a deal!
O'Leary: All right.
  Whoo!
All right!
CUBAN: Congrats, guys.
  Herjavec: That was awesome.
This actually is
  the best financial deal for you.
  It's a great product.
Thank you all so much.
Greiner: Good luck.
  Thank you.
Yay!
Yay! Good job!
I'm so excited!
  Oh!
And to get Mr. Wonderful
  in there, as well,
helping us grow the business,
  could not have asked for more.
I think we just stick with
  this design.
  Yeah.
I think every kid
  should see this in the morning.
They're gonna have nightmares
  every night about it.
Narrator: Last season,
Marc newburger and Jeffrey Simon
  made a deal
with Lori Greiner for their
  car-Safety product, drop stop.
Drop Stop
  reduces driver distraction
by keeping your eyes
  on the road, not in your gap.
The built-In slot
  is designed
to fit easily around
  the seat-Belt catch like so.
You won't even know it's there
  till it stops the drop.
We can make a lot of money
  together,
but we can also save
  a lot of lives together.
Let's see how Marc and Jeffrey
  are doing now.
Since appearing
  on "Shark Tank,"
we have sold hundreds
  of thousands of drop stops.
And that's not just sales
  for us.
That is
  lots of jobs created.
Simon: In the short five months
  since we aired,
we have grossed
  over $5 million in sales.
In the next 12 months,
we project
  over $15 million in sales.
And Lori just landed us
  our first National retail deal.
Greiner: [ gasps ]
Oh, my.
  Oh, my gosh!
  Oh, my god!
[ laughing ]
  Oh, my god!
Not only
  did we get into walmart,
but we got
  into 3,500 walmarts.
That was an order
  valued at $2 million.
What a dream come True.
  My God.
This is unbelievable.
  Dream come True.
  Amazing.
We're going to take over
  the world,
and we're not gonna stop
  until every seat gap is filled.
We are going to make
  a ton of money together,
but we're also gonna help
  save lives.
She's the best partner
  we could have,
and we have
  just gotten started.
Whoo!
  Whoo!
  Whoo!
A few months ago,
  after appearing on "Shark Tank,"
We were honored to
  get an e-Mail from an
  OFFICER, David Gerlach,
and said drop Stop
  could really help
to reduce driver distraction
  for officers.
So that's why we came
  out here -- We wanted to
  donate a set of drop stops
to all 425 officers
  of this police department.
Literally, to be able
  to give something back
to the people who,
  every single day, risk
  their lives for us,
it's just truly
  a dream come True.
All:
  Don't drop and drive!
I'm Kelley coughlan.
  And I'm jenn Deese.
And we are best friends
living in Sunny Santa Monica,
  california.
We're typical l.A. Girls.
We love going Out and can't live
  without our phones.
Melrose P.R.
  This is Jen.
We launched our own company,
  melrose P.R.
We represent clients in travel,
  hospitality, entertainment.
Working in P.R. In l.A.,
we're at the forefront
  of the industry.
There's lights,
  there's cameras,
there's red carpet,
  and it's always showtime.
Our product keeps all your
  essentials at your fingertips,
so gone are the days of digging
  through your oversized handbag.
We help lighten your load
  and keep you stylin',
all at the same time.
We know we can get exposure
with our P.R. Backgrounds,
but we need help
  with sales.
We don't know how to get
  into big-Box retailers.
We want every woman to be able
  to have our product,
but we need the help of
  the sharks to make that happen.
Hi, sharks.
  I'm Kelley coughlan.
And I'm jenn Deese.
And we are
  the creators of...
pursecase.
  Pursecase.
We are here seeking
  a $55,000 investment
in exchange for 12%
  in our company.
If you were to ask people
  what's the one thing
that they would never
  leave the house without,
we are confident that
  a smartphone would top the list.
We love our clutches
  and our totes, but in reality,
they're just not
  the most convenient accessory
for busy publicists
  like ourselves.
[ cellphone RINGS ]
  [ laughter ]
How many times
  have you heard that noise
and had to dig through
  your oversized handbag
  to find your phone?
And who wants to shove
  their smartphone
in the back pocket
  of their skinny jeans?
Not cute.
So, this leaves you
  with one option, and that is
carrying your phone around
  with you in your hand,
which you might
  accidentally drop
or you're gonna eventually
  Put down somewhere
and forget about it
  and lose it.
We kept asking ourselves,
  why isn't there
something that keeps
  everything we need
easy to access
  and secure?
  There has to be a better way.
There has to be.
  Well, now there is.
Introducing pursecase...
  ta-Da!
...The first ever
  smartphone clutch
  that's elegantly designed
with just your phone
  and your essentials in mind.
Now you can keep
  your cash, cards, and I.D.
All at your fingertips
  in the most stylish way.
Pursecase comes
  in a variety of colors
to help accessorize
  any outfit,
always
  with a stylish chain handle,
which doubles
  as a bracelet,
and a compact mirror
just in case
  of a fashion emergency.
Deese: So, now I'm gonna
  pass them out for you guys.
Here's the classy white
  for you.
'cause I'm a classy guy.
  Of course!
Your daughters
  can fight over that.
The royal purple
  for you, Lori,
queen of qvc.
  Thank you. [ laughs ]
the black for you,
  Mr. Wonderful.
  I love it. Thank you.
Herjavec: Oh!
  I accept the bribe.
  Greiner: Oh, I got money.
  [ laughs ]
I got money, too!
DEESE: And then blue
  for the mavs for you, mark.
  Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
Coughlan: Sharks, we know
  we have a hit on our hands,
and we are
  at the tipping point.
We are hustlers,
  and we are ready
to start making your money back
  immediately.
Deese: So, which lucky one
  of you wants to ride this wave
to millions of dollars
  with us?
Join the pursecase team,
  and you, too,
can be stylin'...
  and Dialin'.
Kelley, I just -- I just
  came back from europe.
We were in Italy,
  and you see cases
that look exactly like this
  for phones, covers.
You do,
  but not with a pocket.
That's the only difference.
  Yeah.
So everything
  you're showing me here,
including
  the little handle,
is all over Europe
  in those little, cheap stores,
except the pocket.
That's right.
  Correct.
Greiner:
  I have a question.
You guys know
  phones are constantly changing.
  Absolutely.
So what smartphones
  do you have pursecases for?
Currently,
  we're making pursecase
for iphone 4
  and iphone 5.
However, we have filed for
  a utility patent,
which covers the functionality
  of having the flap
for a credit-Card, I.D.,
  a little bit of cash,
and, also,
  with a chain handle.
How much do you think
  you'll sell of this stuff?
We're just now starting
  to fulfill orders.
But in the first
  three months,
we did $30,000
  simply of preorders.
Wow.
And then we've projected
for this first calendar year
  of ours, in business,
about $240,000.
What does it cost you
  to make it?
  $4.42.
And then it's $15 wholesale,
  $38 retail.
Our margins
  are really good --
88% when we sell
  direct Online
and then 71%.
O'Leary: You don't find it
  a little steep at $38
for the online orders?
  We've had no resistance
  to the price whatsoever.
Ladies, you should be
  selling it for $19.95
and you'd sell
  10 times more.
We did some P.R.
  Around the initial prototypes,
and the demand
  was just insane.
And a manufacturer
  actually came to us.
Who is that?
  Did they do a deal
  with you?
It's called
  dall international,
and it's
  a logistics company.
And they said, "Listen,
"We want to make a deal
  with you guys.
We see this as being
  a huge opportunity
  for our company."
What's your deal with them,
  though?
15% equity stake
  in the company.
But they have extended us
  a million-Dollar credit line.
Wow.
  Cuban: Good for you guys.
We can do any-- I mean, we can
  get things here in 45 days.
So, why do you need
  the $55,000?
We're looking to cast
  a wider net.
We're gonna spend
  some of the money on molds
to move into
  the Samsung galaxy s4.
That's the initial
  one that we have a
  lot of demand for.
Do you know
  I sell something
that looks really similar
  to that already...
didn't know that.
Ooh.
  ...on Qvc?
What does it
  look like?
It looks
  very much like that.
Jenn, Kelley, I-I admire
  all the work that you've done,
but seriously...
I just spent two weeks looking
  at this on every street corner.
I'm out.
Well, we appreciate that.
  Coughlan: Thank you.
  We appreciate that.
Corcoran:
  I think, jenn and Kelley --
I think the design on this
  is adorable.
Thank you. Thank you.
  It's very Chanel-Y.
And I'm sure that's
  exactly what you're after.
I think the Mirror's clever.
But the two pieces
  I would have liked to have seen
is a change purse
  and basically no flap.
I kind of like it
  streamlined.
Not for me. I'm out.
Okay.
We appreciate that.
  Thank you.
  All right. Thank you.
Guys, I'll go next.
  Um...
I'm not a fan of the
  technology-Accessory business.
That's just not me, because
  it's just e-Everybody's whim,
and if you make a zig
  and Everybody else zags,
you're out of luck.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
  Thank you.
I appreciate that.
O'Leary:
  I like you guys, and I think
what you brought to the table
  is rather unique,
particularly
  a million-Dollar credit line.
That's pretty rare.
So here's an offer for you.
I give you $55,000.
I get $1 a unit
until I get my $55,000 back,
and then I get 75 cents a unit
  in perpetuity.
Herjavec: Wow.
Appreciate your offer.
  Thank you for your offer.
Wasn't expecting that.
You know, I always say
  I can tell instantly
if it's a hero or a zero.
And the minute
  that you walked in here,
I looked at it,
  and I thought...
...it's a superhero.
I really like it.
Now, it is very much like
  something that I already sell.
But because I've sold
hundreds of thousands
  of my own...
  we know.
...I think that I can sell
hundreds of thousands
  of these, too.
So I'm gonna make you
  an offer.
And my offer is...
$55,000, 15%.
That's it.
That's a deal.
  Lori, you've got a deal.
Like, no questions asked.
You've basically gave us
  exactly what we wanted.
  Oh, my.
And thank you.
  But Kelley, jenn,
  what about Kevin's offer?
Mr. Wonderful, we so
  appreciate the offer, but...
  we really do
  appreciate that.
We came in here for Lori.
  You know we did.
I love it. I love it.
  Thank you!
I think it's awesome.
We're so excited!
  Aah!
[ laughs ]
  That's exactly
  what we wanted,
and I cannot wait
  to work with you.
  Thank you! Aah!
It's really, really cute.
Thank you, everyone!
  Thank you guys so much!
Nice job.
[ laughing ] Oh, my God.
I might cry.
Yes!
  We're gonna sell a million!
Does it not worry you
  that there's
so many things like it
  out there?
Cuban: For $55,000?
  No, because I have
  the perfect medium.
I have a show on qvc.
  Yeah. This is perfect
  for qvc.
It's just a line extension
  to you.
My customers
  will love this,
and I want to bring it
  to them at a great price.
Good job, Lori.
  That'll be great for you.
  Herjavec: Wow.
Narrator:
  Next up is an entrepreneur
with a sweet take
  on customization.
[ Boston Accent ]
  Hello, sharks.
and the choice to add
  up to five toppings
from a selection of over 100.
In addition to creating the
  chocolate bar of your dreams,
our bars are perfect
  for all occasions.
We put special edible messages
  in the chocolate bars,
such as "Happy birthday."
We also can put
  special edible corporate logos
or pictures
  in the chocolate bar,
making it great for
  corporate events and weddings.
So I've packed up some dreamy,
  delicious chocolate bars
that have been made special
  for each one of you.
Greiner:
  You're from massachusetts?
Easy to tell, right?
I love your accent.
  I love that accent.
Thank you.
  Herjavec: Thank you.
Greiner: Thank you.
  Low-Cal, right?
[ laughs ] Completely.
  [ Laughs ] low-Cal.
Oh, it's cute.
Wow. This tastes great.
  Corcoran: Mmm.
And about a year and a half ago,
  I decided to join him.
My background
  is actually finance.
Greiner:
  So, are you partners?
  We're partners together.
  Exactly.
What's the split?
  He actually
  owns half the company,
and myself and one
  other shareholder own about 18%,
and then we have
  two other shareholders.
having fun, giving it as
  a gift, and that's about it,
or do I have repeat orders
  from the same customers?
  No, there's repeat orders.
We are by far the largest
  customized chocolate in
  the United States.
You got $500,000
  in sales!
  Yeah.
There's no company that's
  dominant with $500,000 in sales.
But -- but -- but -- but --
  but -- but this year,
we have
  a very large car company
in the U.S. That we do
  a promotional event.
In the last 12 months, we've
  done over $125,000 in Sales.
Yeah, that's gonna be
  your business --
Corporate-Type purchases,
  as opposed to consumer.
Exactly, and that's what
  we're trying to focus on.
depending on what toppings
  and customization.
And what does it cost you
  to make?
It costs us
  about $2 to make.
Okay, but what's your plan
  for your investors?
Let's say I actually
  agreed with this valuation,
which I haven't even
  started to tear the
  peanuts out of yet.
Okay.
  Let's just think
  about the $500,000
I give you as a minority guy
  with 20%.
How do I get
  my chocolate back?
You're gonna
  get your money back
in approximately
  three to four years,
or in the case
  of a liquidation event,
in which we're a great
  acquisition target, our company.
Why would you -- Why
  would you be a great
  acquisition target?
'Cause I don't see it.
  Be-Because -- Because the LARGE
  companies mass-Produce.
What we do is -- Is --
  is customize.
  Do you know why they
  mass-Produce?
Because they make money
  that way.
Cuban: Where --
  It's a much different model
than a mass-Production model,
  which are not -- not alike.
  I get that, right?
But there's nothing there
that can't be reproduced
  by somebody else.
Could I take $2 million
  or $2.5 million
and go and do
  the exact same thing?
W-W-- I mean, you c--
  You technically could do it,
but you'd be hiring people
  to manage it --
people like me, who are
  quality -- Quality managers.
All right. Today is
  the best day of your life.
You've come
  into the Shark Tank.
You've met me,
  Mr. Wonderful.
I'll make you an offer.
Leave these guys.
[ laughs ]
I'll give you $500,000
  to start from scratch.
You're my chocolate guy.
You're gonna get 25% equity
  in the business.
That's a first.
  [ chuckles ]
  I wouldn't do that.
Why not? You're gonna get
  a lot more equity.
And listen,
  anybody can do it.
Anybody can't do it.
  That's the problem.
We have a brand name.
  We have customer loyalty.
People are beginning
  to recognize who we are.
I don't have a brand name.
  Nobody knows Mr. Wonderful.
I think I'll take a shot
  at it now. You're starting
  to get me interested.
Mr. Wonderful's chocolate --
  Customized chocolate?
Absolutely.
  Yeah.
that's as good as managing it
  as me and Fabian.
I just found one.
  It's you.
  [ laughter ]
GREINER:
  That's a first.
Of course.
  O'Leary: And he can.
Hey, you know what,
  there's no one better than Kevin
at running a business
  into the ground.
  [ laughter ]
herjavec: The -- the thing
  that really turned me off --
what you've said to me is
  I am the --
at half a million
  a year,
I am the dominant guy
  in the United States for this.
Well, the customized space
  is small, right?
The customize-- It's --
  It's a small market right now.
And that excites me?
Such a competitive
  business. Ooh.
But -- but we don't know
  how big it is
because we're -- We're -- We're
  the first big -- Big player
in the market
  in the United States.
Look, I love the chocolate,
  but I'm not sharing
your -- your vision on the size
  of the market.
Look, this is the thing.
It -- It's a tchotchke.
Look, I'm getting over
  the sugar high.
I'm starting to crash.
  I'm out.
Thank you.
Cuban: Look, if you came in
  and said that you had
something very special in terms
  of your s.E.O.,
in terms of your sales process,
  you invented something --
but you haven't
  done that at all.
You haven't
  differentiated yourself.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
Corcoran: You said, uh,
  through your own admission
that customization
  is expensive.
And from my way
  of thinking,
that's what's wrong
  with this business.
And when I look
  at your packaging,
I really think
  it looks dated,
not attractive,
and it wouldn't make me feel
  like I'm giving
an EXPENSIVE or special anything
  to someone.
That's part of what I want
  to use the money for, is to
  create new Packaging, as well.
I don't think you're
  gonna generate a profit
  on this business
for a very long time,
  so I'm out.
Okay.
I like the name
  chocomize.
Chocomize!
I think that's clever.
But this is
  a very niche market.
For me, I like to go big,
and I like to invest
  in things that are
  gonna go really big.
And I don't see that
  for this,
so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
As usual, all roads
  lead back to Mr. Wonderful.
So let me reiterate
  my offer, okay?
I'll give you $500,000
  and 25% equity
in Mr. Wonderful's
  customizable-Chocolate business.
Okay.
  You come and work for me.
  We use my Boston offices.
Okay.
  And we start with
  our first Mr. Wonderful bars
that have a slogan I love --
  "You're dead to me."
We're gonna sell
  millions of them.
Okay.
  Yes or no?
Sorry. No.
I'm gonna order my first
  "you're dead to me" Bar,
  and it's going to you.
[ laughter ]
  I will -- I will
  be ready for it.
Thank you.
  You are dead to me.
  I'm out.
Thank you very much, guys.
  Thank you.
I feel pretty good
I think I held strong
and I stayed loyal
  to my management team.
Mr. Wonderful -- I-I can't
  wait till he starts his
  own chocolate company.
And, you know,
  we'll compete directly with him
and hopefully crush him, and
  I can send him a bar that says,
"Hey, you should have
  invested in Chocomize."
He's got a nice, little
  business. You can't
  crush him for that.
Yeah, it is.
  It's a small, little business.
Why -- Why wouldn't I start
  this myself if I want to be
  in this business?
You could,
  but why would you?
  Well, I'd hire him.
  Come on.
That's a first. He tried
  to steal Someone's employee.
[ Boston Accent ]
  Customized chocolate bar!
[ Laughter ]
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is a husband-And-Wife team
with a twist
  to a common accessory.
Hi, sharks.
We're Rick and Melissa hinnant
  from Austin, texas,
and we're here today to
  knock your socks off, literally.
Our company is
  grace &amp; lace,
and we're seeking $175,000
for a 10% equity stake
  in our company.
Grace &amp; lace
  has taken the Boring sock...
Boring!
...that women wear
  under their boots,
and we've turned it into a Lacy,
  frilly fashion statement.
Our story starts
  a couple of years ago.
I had an idea
  for a cute, little, Lacy sock
that stuck out
  of my boots.
So after about nine hours
  on the sewing machine
and a ton of frustration,
I finally made
  my first pair.
Everywhere I wore them,
people would stop me
  and ask me where I got them.
When I said I made them,
  literally, strangers would
give me their phone number,
  ask me to make them a pair.
So I threw up online
  to see if they'd sell.
They did, instantly.
Before we knew it,
  a business was born,
and we had
  an accidental company.
And Melissa's gonna show you
  some of our top Sellers.
Here. Mm-hmm.
  Thank you.
Thank you.
  Mm-hmm.
Really quite beautiful.
  Nicely done.
  Thank you.
Cuban: Thank you.
  Appreciate it.
O'Leary: What's your sales?
  Corcoran: What are your sales?
Our first calendar year,
  2012,
we did
  over $800,000 in sales.
Whoa!
  Wow!
  $800,000?
Our last 12 months
  to date,
we did $1.125 million
  in sales.
Hey!
  CORCORAN: You've got to be
  kidding me.
I'm not kidding you.
  Wow. That's very good.
I was going to ignore you
  completely, but now...
Yeah.
Are you selling them all
  online?
Um...
  90% of our sales
  are online.
Wow. Good for you.
  And August of last year
was our first launch
  into stores,
so we're now
  in over 230 stores.
I'm really happy for you,
  and I think that it's great
that you've made
  this incredible success.
I have to be honest, though.
It-- it did shock me.
  It still shocks me.
I'm glad you did it, but I
  can't relate to the product.
So for that reason,
  I'm out.
Herjavec: Look, the --
  the proof is in the money.
Convince me why you need
  $175,000 today.
[ sighs ] we need
  a strategic partner.
Two weeks into my business,
  after I sold my first pair,
we got an e-Mail
  from Nordstrom's asking
if I had the ability
  to make 30,000 to 50,000 pairs.
At that time, I didn't even know
  that I could make 20.
  That's ridic--
  There's no way.
You obviously don't need
  the money. What do you need?
Like I said, I think that
  we can grow this company
to $5 million
  to $10 million.
I think that we have
  the capability to do that.
But we're looking
  at you guys
to take us
  to $100 million plus.
It could be
  much bigger than that.
And that's
  what we're looking for,
is the strategic part
  more than anything.
Corcoran:
  I'd like to put an offer
  on the table, get it going,
'cause I think we have
  a lot of interest here.
I think
  your valuation is good.
I don't think you're greedy
  based on what your sales are.
So I'm willing to give you
  $87,500 for 5% of your business
if you get another shark
  in with me.
Okay.
  Okay. Thank you.
I'll give you $175,000
  for 20%.
It drops down to 10% as soon
  as you pay back the capital.
That assures me
  my capital comes out.
And I'm willing to put more
  back in if I have to.
Um...thank you
  for your offer.
I will consider that.
  Consider it. Yeah.
Who else is gonna step up?
I know you're thinking
  Pretty hard over there, Robert.
And that's a fair question
  they can ask.
And I absolutely want
  to respect you.
I also want to hear
  everything else.
And I think, you know,
  being a smart businessman,
you would understand that,
  as well.
Would you agree?
You -- You got to make
  a decision on my deal.
I mean, I'm --
  I'm happy to pull out...
sure.
  ...and let you deal
  with the other guys,
or I'm happy to
  have you take my deal.
  I'm just --
I'm just interested in
  hearing what is out there
so I can make the best educated
  decision for you and me.
I understand.
  What is there left to decide?
In the Shark Tank, we call this
  bone-In-Mouth disease.
It's a dog looking
  into a pond with a
  bone in their mouth.
Kevin, I don't -- I don't need
  you to make it better or worse.
But I'm just telling you
  right now
it is bone-In-Mouth disease
  right here.
For the 10% -- Kevin, quiet!
  This is the dilemma
  of the Shark Tank.
I'm Loving the drama.
  I'm Loving it.
  Quiet!
It's $175,000 for 10%.
  It's what you asked for.
Can I ask you
  a few more questions?
Yes or no?
Narrator:
  One shark is out.
Barbara and Kevin
  have offers on the table,
but Robert
  has offered Rick and Melissa
exactly what they asked for --
  $175,000 for 10%.
Yes or No?
Can I ask you
  a few more questions?
I've given you
  exactly what you're asking for.
I'm a very nice guy,
but don't mistake my kindness
  for weakness.
Yes or no?
Greiner: You guys,
  this is a moment
that you don't want to
  walk away from and say, "uh-Oh."
$175,000 for 10%.
I-I'm happy to go out.
Can we discuss it outside?
And I would actually do the deal
  that I offered to you.
Cuban: Look, I like
  what you guys are doing.
Question is, where are you gonna
  need the most amount of help?
So when you
  did your projections --
$1 million, $5 million,
  $10 million, $100 million --
What were the pain points
  where you said,
"Oh, my goodness, how am I
  gonna get through this?"
that's what I want to know.
We're not looking to suck
  a ton of your time,
because we understand
  time is the only commodity
that we can't
  get more of.
  Amen.
So I'm looking to be able
  to call and say,
"Hey, you know,
  we're at the $5 million mark,
"and we are gonna expand
  this year to $10 million.
What should we be doing?"
Okay, I'll offer you
  $175,000 for 10%.
But I need to know right now
  yes or No.
Can we talk about it
  in the hallway?
Corcoran: Wow.
There's a difference
  between trying to gather
as much information as you can
  and indecision.
There are gonna be many
  times in the evolution
  of your business
where you can't be indecisive,
and right now
  you're demonstrating
that you're
  being indecisive.
Yeah, but we came in
  with a strategy,
and we knew
  who we wanted,
so it wasn't indecisive --
  Not at all.
I'm going to revise
  my offer.
I'm gonna change the offer
to give you exactly
  what you asked for,
but half of the money
  is going to be a line of credit.
Okay.
  So what's the answer?
The answer is We would love
  to do business with Barbara.
We think that she
  brings the most.
  O'Leary: Whoa.
You know what? You picked
  the smartest person here.
Good decision.
I think it was
  a very good decision.
  Thank you.
Thank you.
  Terrifically done.
  You were great under pressure.
Thank you.
  Terrific together.
We -- we came in with
  a plan, and sometimes
  it works out, right?
Herjavec: Nice job.
  O'Leary: Congratulations.
  Greiner: Good luck.
We went with our gut,
  and it worked out,
with the exact partner
  that we wanted.
  Yeah.
Absolutely incredible.
  It couldn't have gone better.
We did it!
and she just has
  that go-Get-'em attitude,
and I think that we'll just pair
  really well with her.
  Mm-hmm.
They were
  great negotiators.
  Well, they just do
  what they wanted.
They should have
  just asked for Barbara
is what
  they should have done.
  That's all right.
You know what?
  They were sharks wearing socks.
[ laughter ]
  I don't know
  if they were sharks.
Well said.
