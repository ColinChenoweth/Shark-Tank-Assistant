I'm Kelley coughlan.
  And I'm jenn Deese.
And we are best friends
living in Sunny Santa Monica,
  california.
We're typical l.A. Girls.
We love going Out and can't live
  without our phones.
Melrose P.R.
  This is Jen.
We launched our own company,
  melrose P.R.
We represent clients in travel,
  hospitality, entertainment.
Working in P.R. In l.A.,
we're at the forefront
  of the industry.
There's lights,
  there's cameras,
there's red carpet,
  and it's always showtime.
Our product keeps all your
  essentials at your fingertips,
so gone are the days of digging
  through your oversized handbag.
We help lighten your load
  and keep you stylin',
all at the same time.
We know we can get exposure
with our P.R. Backgrounds,
but we need help
  with sales.
We don't know how to get
  into big-Box retailers.
We want every woman to be able
  to have our product,
but we need the help of
  the sharks to make that happen.
Hi, sharks.
  I'm Kelley coughlan.
And I'm jenn Deese.
And we are
  the creators of...
pursecase.
  Pursecase.
We are here seeking
  a $55,000 investment
in exchange for 12%
  in our company.
If you were to ask people
  what's the one thing
that they would never
  leave the house without,
we are confident that
  a smartphone would top the list.
We love our clutches
  and our totes, but in reality,
they're just not
  the most convenient accessory
for busy publicists
  like ourselves.

How many times
  have you heard that noise
and had to dig through
  your oversized handbag
  to find your phone?
And who wants to shove
  their smartphone
in the back pocket
  of their skinny jeans?
Not cute.
So, this leaves you
  with one option, and that is
carrying your phone around
  with you in your hand,
which you might
  accidentally drop
or you're gonna eventually
  Put down somewhere
and forget about it
  and lose it.
We kept asking ourselves,
  why isn't there
something that keeps
  everything we need
easy to access
  and secure?
  There has to be a better way.
There has to be.
  Well, now there is.
Introducing pursecase...
  ta-Da!
...The first ever
  smartphone clutch
  that's elegantly designed
with just your phone
  and your essentials in mind.
Now you can keep
  your cash, cards, and I.D.
All at your fingertips
  in the most stylish way.
Pursecase comes
  in a variety of colors
to help accessorize
  any outfit,
always
  with a stylish chain handle,
which doubles
  as a bracelet,
and a compact mirror
just in case
  of a fashion emergency.
Deese: So, now I'm gonna
  pass them out for you guys.
Here's the classy white
  for you.
'cause I'm a classy guy.
  Of course!
Your daughters
  can fight over that.
The royal purple
  for you, Lori,
queen of qvc.
  Thank you. [ laughs ]
the black for you,
  Mr. Wonderful.
  I love it. Thank you.
Herjavec: Oh!
  I accept the bribe.
  Greiner: Oh, I got money.
  [ laughs ]
I got money, too!
DEESE: And then blue
  for the mavs for you, mark.
  Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
Coughlan: Sharks, we know
  we have a hit on our hands,
and we are
  at the tipping point.
We are hustlers,
  and we are ready
to start making your money back
  immediately.
Deese: So, which lucky one
  of you wants to ride this wave
to millions of dollars
  with us?
Join the pursecase team,
  and you, too,
can be stylin'...
  and Dialin'.
Kelley, I just -- I just
  came back from europe.
We were in Italy,
  and you see cases
that look exactly like this
  for phones, covers.
You do,
  but not with a pocket.
That's the only difference.
  Yeah.
So everything
  you're showing me here,
including
  the little handle,
is all over Europe
  in those little, cheap stores,
except the pocket.
That's right.
  Correct.
Greiner:
  I have a question.
You guys know
  phones are constantly changing.
  Absolutely.
So what smartphones
  do you have pursecases for?
Currently,
  we're making pursecase
for iphone 4
  and iphone 5.
However, we have filed for
  a utility patent,
which covers the functionality
  of having the flap
for a credit-Card, I.D.,
  a little bit of cash,
and, also,
  with a chain handle.
How much do you think
  you'll sell of this stuff?
We're just now starting
  to fulfill orders.
But in the first
  three months,
we did $30,000
  simply of preorders.
Wow.
And then we've projected
for this first calendar year
  of ours, in business,
about $240,000.
What does it cost you
  to make it?
  $4.42.
And then it's $15 wholesale,
  $38 retail.
Our margins
  are really good --
88% when we sell
  direct Online
and then 71%.
O'Leary: You don't find it
  a little steep at $38
for the online orders?
  We've had no resistance
  to the price whatsoever.
Ladies, you should be
  selling it for $19.95
and you'd sell
  10 times more.
We did some P.R.
  Around the initial prototypes,
and the demand
  was just insane.
And a manufacturer
  actually came to us.
Who is that?
  Did they do a deal
  with you?
It's called
  dall international,
and it's
  a logistics company.
And they said, "Listen,
"We want to make a deal
  with you guys.
We see this as being
  a huge opportunity
  for our company."
What's your deal with them,
  though?
15% equity stake
  in the company.
But they have extended us
  a million-Dollar credit line.
Wow.
  Cuban: Good for you guys.
We can do any-- I mean, we can
  get things here in 45 days.
So, why do you need
  the $55,000?
We're looking to cast
  a wider net.
We're gonna spend
  some of the money on molds
to move into
  the Samsung galaxy s4.
That's the initial
  one that we have a
  lot of demand for.
Do you know
  I sell something
that looks really similar
  to that already...
didn't know that.
Ooh.
  ...on Qvc?
What does it
  look like?
It looks
  very much like that.
Jenn, Kelley, I-I admire
  all the work that you've done,
but seriously...
I just spent two weeks looking
  at this on every street corner.
I'm out.
Well, we appreciate that.
  Coughlan: Thank you.
  We appreciate that.
Corcoran:
  I think, jenn and Kelley --
I think the design on this
  is adorable.
Thank you. Thank you.
  It's very Chanel-Y.
And I'm sure that's
  exactly what you're after.
I think the Mirror's clever.
But the two pieces
  I would have liked to have seen
is a change purse
  and basically no flap.
I kind of like it
  streamlined.
Not for me. I'm out.
Okay.
We appreciate that.
  Thank you.
  All right. Thank you.
Guys, I'll go next.
  Um...
I'm not a fan of the
  technology-Accessory business.
That's just not me, because
  it's just e-Everybody's whim,
and if you make a zig
  and Everybody else zags,
you're out of luck.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
  Thank you.
I appreciate that.
O'Leary:
  I like you guys, and I think
what you brought to the table
  is rather unique,
particularly
  a million-Dollar credit line.
That's pretty rare.
So here's an offer for you.
I give you $55,000.
I get $1 a unit
until I get my $55,000 back,
and then I get 75 cents a unit
  in perpetuity.
Herjavec: Wow.
Appreciate your offer.
  Thank you for your offer.
Wasn't expecting that.
You know, I always say
  I can tell instantly
if it's a hero or a zero.
And the minute
  that you walked in here,
I looked at it,
  and I thought...
...it's a superhero.
I really like it.
Now, it is very much like
  something that I already sell.
But because I've sold
hundreds of thousands
  of my own...
  we know.
...I think that I can sell
hundreds of thousands
  of these, too.
So I'm gonna make you
  an offer.
And my offer is...
$55,000, 15%.
That's it.
That's a deal.
  Lori, you've got a deal.
Like, no questions asked.
You've basically gave us
  exactly what we wanted.
  Oh, my.
And thank you.
  But Kelley, jenn,
  what about Kevin's offer?
Mr. Wonderful, we so
  appreciate the offer, but...
  we really do
  appreciate that.
We came in here for Lori.
  You know we did.
I love it. I love it.
  Thank you!
I think it's awesome.
We're so excited!
  Aah!
[ laughs ]
  That's exactly
  what we wanted,
and I cannot wait
  to work with you.
  Thank you! Aah!
It's really, really cute.
Thank you, everyone!
  Thank you guys so much!
Nice job.
[ laughing ] Oh, my God.
I might cry.
Yes!
  We're gonna sell a million!
Does it not worry you
  that there's
so many things like it
  out there?
Cuban: For $55,000?
  No, because I have
  the perfect medium.
I have a show on qvc.
  Yeah. This is perfect
  for qvc.
It's just a line extension
  to you.
My customers
  will love this,
and I want to bring it
  to them at a great price.
Good job, Lori.
  That'll be great for you.
  Herjavec: Wow.
Narrator:
  Next up is an entrepreneur
with a sweet take
  on customization.
