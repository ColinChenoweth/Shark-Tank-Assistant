My name is Joe dauenhauer,
  and my company is chocomize.
I'm seeking $500,000
in exchange for a 20% equity
  interest in my company.
The current chocolate-Bar market
  hasn't seen much innovation
in its products
  in a very long time.
Quite frankly, most chocolate
  bars are just plain Boring.
Chocomize solves this problem
  by allowing customers
to create their own
  chocolate bars online.
Let me show you how it works.
Customers start
  by choosing a shape.
Then, they choose
  a belgian-Based chocolate
of milk, dark, or white,
Joe, what's the middle
  made from, the picture part?
Can you eat that, too?
  Everything's edible.
What are you doing
  in the chocolate business?
My partner, Fabian,
  who's from Germany --
He started the company
  three years ago.
So, Joe,
  walk me through the numbers.
So, last year,
  we -- We did $440,000 in sales.
Okay. But -- but what about
  the year before? Just curious.
The year before,
  we actually did $500,000.
Oh, so you had a dip
  last year?
  A small dip.
Part of the reason
  is because we moved facilities.
We built out
  a 5,000-Square-Foot facility
where we make
  all the chocolate, so --
is this a really tiny niche
  that's gonna stay tiny?
Because I guess
  if I analyze your customers,
am I gonna find a bunch
  of people buying it once,
Joe, walk me through the
  profit margin on a single bar.
We sell our bars for
  an average of $6 to $6.50,
I'm in.
  Dauenhauer:
  I dare you to find a guy
You know, Joe,
  with all due respect to Kevin,
he thinks
  he can run any business.
All right.
  Well, Joe, I'm gonna go online.
