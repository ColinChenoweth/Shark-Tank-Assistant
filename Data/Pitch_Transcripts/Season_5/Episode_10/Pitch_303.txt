My name is Joe dauenhauer,
  and my company is chocomize.
I'm seeking $500,000
in exchange for a 20% equity
  interest in my company.
The current chocolate-Bar market
  hasn't seen much innovation
in its products
  in a very long time.
Quite frankly, most chocolate
  bars are just plain Boring.
Chocomize solves this problem
  by allowing customers
to create their own
  chocolate bars online.
Let me show you how it works.
Customers start
  by choosing a shape.
Then, they choose
  a belgian-Based chocolate
of milk, dark, or white,
and the choice to add
  up to five toppings
from a selection of over 100.
In addition to creating the
  chocolate bar of your dreams,
our bars are perfect
  for all occasions.
We put special edible messages
  in the chocolate bars,
such as "Happy birthday."
We also can put
  special edible corporate logos
or pictures
  in the chocolate bar,
making it great for
  corporate events and weddings.
So I've packed up some dreamy,
  delicious chocolate bars
that have been made special
  for each one of you.
Greiner:
  You're from massachusetts?
Easy to tell, right?
I love your accent.
  I love that accent.
Thank you.
  Herjavec: Thank you.
Greiner: Thank you.
  Low-Cal, right?
[ laughs ] Completely.
  [ Laughs ] low-Cal.
Oh, it's cute.
Wow. This tastes great.
  Corcoran: Mmm.
Joe, what's the middle
  made from, the picture part?
Can you eat that, too?
  Everything's edible.
What are you doing
  in the chocolate business?
My partner, Fabian,
  who's from Germany --
He started the company
  three years ago.
And about a year and a half ago,
  I decided to join him.
My background
  is actually finance.
Greiner:
  So, are you partners?
  We're partners together.
  Exactly.
What's the split?
  He actually
  owns half the company,
and myself and one
  other shareholder own about 18%,
and then we have
  two other shareholders.
So, Joe,
  walk me through the numbers.
So, last year,
  we -- We did $440,000 in sales.
Okay. But -- but what about
  the year before? Just curious.
The year before,
  we actually did $500,000.
Oh, so you had a dip
  last year?
  A small dip.
Part of the reason
  is because we moved facilities.
We built out
  a 5,000-Square-Foot facility
where we make
  all the chocolate, so --
is this a really tiny niche
  that's gonna stay tiny?
Because I guess
  if I analyze your customers,
am I gonna find a bunch
  of people buying it once,
having fun, giving it as
  a gift, and that's about it,
or do I have repeat orders
  from the same customers?
  No, there's repeat orders.
We are by far the largest
  customized chocolate in
  the United States.
You got $500,000
  in sales!
  Yeah.
There's no company that's
  dominant with $500,000 in sales.
But -- but -- but -- but --
  but -- but this year,
we have
  a very large car company
in the U.S. That we do
  a promotional event.
In the last 12 months, we've
  done over $125,000 in Sales.
Yeah, that's gonna be
  your business --
Corporate-Type purchases,
  as opposed to consumer.
Exactly, and that's what
  we're trying to focus on.
Joe, walk me through the
  profit margin on a single bar.
We sell our bars for
  an average of $6 to $6.50,
depending on what toppings
  and customization.
And what does it cost you
  to make?
It costs us
  about $2 to make.
Okay, but what's your plan
  for your investors?
Let's say I actually
  agreed with this valuation,
which I haven't even
  started to tear the
  peanuts out of yet.
Okay.
  Let's just think
  about the $500,000
I give you as a minority guy
  with 20%.
How do I get
  my chocolate back?
You're gonna
  get your money back
in approximately
  three to four years,
or in the case
  of a liquidation event,
in which we're a great
  acquisition target, our company.
Why would you -- Why
  would you be a great
  acquisition target?
'Cause I don't see it.
  Be-Because -- Because the LARGE
  companies mass-Produce.
What we do is -- Is --
  is customize.
  Do you know why they
  mass-Produce?
Because they make money
  that way.
Cuban: Where --
  It's a much different model
than a mass-Production model,
  which are not -- not alike.
  I get that, right?
But there's nothing there
that can't be reproduced
  by somebody else.
Could I take $2 million
  or $2.5 million
and go and do
  the exact same thing?
W-W-- I mean, you c--
  You technically could do it,
but you'd be hiring people
  to manage it --
people like me, who are
  quality -- Quality managers.
All right. Today is
  the best day of your life.
You've come
  into the Shark Tank.
You've met me,
  Mr. Wonderful.
I'll make you an offer.
Leave these guys.
[ laughs ]
I'll give you $500,000
  to start from scratch.
You're my chocolate guy.
You're gonna get 25% equity
  in the business.
That's a first.
  [ chuckles ]
  I wouldn't do that.
Why not? You're gonna get
  a lot more equity.
And listen,
  anybody can do it.
Anybody can't do it.
  That's the problem.
We have a brand name.
  We have customer loyalty.
People are beginning
  to recognize who we are.
I don't have a brand name.
  Nobody knows Mr. Wonderful.
I think I'll take a shot
  at it now. You're starting
  to get me interested.
Mr. Wonderful's chocolate --
  Customized chocolate?
Absolutely.
  Yeah.
I'm in.
  Dauenhauer:
  I dare you to find a guy
that's as good as managing it
  as me and Fabian.
I just found one.
  It's you.
  [ laughter ]
GREINER:
  That's a first.
You know, Joe,
  with all due respect to Kevin,
he thinks
  he can run any business.
Of course.
  O'Leary: And he can.
Hey, you know what,
  there's no one better than Kevin
at running a business
  into the ground.
  [ laughter ]
herjavec: The -- the thing
  that really turned me off --
what you've said to me is
  I am the --
at half a million
  a year,
I am the dominant guy
  in the United States for this.
Well, the customized space
  is small, right?
The customize-- It's --
  It's a small market right now.
And that excites me?
Such a competitive
  business. Ooh.
But -- but we don't know
  how big it is
because we're -- We're -- We're
  the first big -- Big player
in the market
  in the United States.
Look, I love the chocolate,
  but I'm not sharing
your -- your vision on the size
  of the market.
Look, this is the thing.
It -- It's a tchotchke.
Look, I'm getting over
  the sugar high.
I'm starting to crash.
  I'm out.
Thank you.
Cuban: Look, if you came in
  and said that you had
something very special in terms
  of your s.E.O.,
in terms of your sales process,
  you invented something --
but you haven't
  done that at all.
You haven't
  differentiated yourself.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
Corcoran: You said, uh,
  through your own admission
that customization
  is expensive.
And from my way
  of thinking,
that's what's wrong
  with this business.
And when I look
  at your packaging,
I really think
  it looks dated,
not attractive,
and it wouldn't make me feel
  like I'm giving
an EXPENSIVE or special anything
  to someone.
That's part of what I want
  to use the money for, is to
  create new Packaging, as well.
I don't think you're
  gonna generate a profit
  on this business
for a very long time,
  so I'm out.
Okay.
I like the name
  chocomize.
Chocomize!
I think that's clever.
But this is
  a very niche market.
For me, I like to go big,
and I like to invest
  in things that are
  gonna go really big.
And I don't see that
  for this,
so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
As usual, all roads
  lead back to Mr. Wonderful.
So let me reiterate
  my offer, okay?
I'll give you $500,000
  and 25% equity
in Mr. Wonderful's
  customizable-Chocolate business.
Okay.
  You come and work for me.
  We use my Boston offices.
Okay.
  And we start with
  our first Mr. Wonderful bars
that have a slogan I love --
  "You're dead to me."
We're gonna sell
  millions of them.
Okay.
  Yes or no?
Sorry. No.
All right.
  Well, Joe, I'm gonna go online.
I'm gonna order my first
  "you're dead to me" Bar,
  and it's going to you.
[ laughter ]
  I will -- I will
  be ready for it.
Thank you.
  You are dead to me.
  I'm out.
Thank you very much, guys.
  Thank you.
I feel pretty good
I think I held strong
and I stayed loyal
  to my management team.
Mr. Wonderful -- I-I can't
  wait till he starts his
  own chocolate company.
And, you know,
  we'll compete directly with him
and hopefully crush him, and
  I can send him a bar that says,
"Hey, you should have
  invested in Chocomize."
He's got a nice, little
  business. You can't
  crush him for that.
Yeah, it is.
  It's a small, little business.
Why -- Why wouldn't I start
  this myself if I want to be
  in this business?
You could,
  but why would you?
  Well, I'd hire him.
  Come on.
That's a first. He tried
  to steal Someone's employee.
[ Boston Accent ]
  Customized chocolate bar!
[ Laughter ]
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is a husband-And-Wife team
with a twist
  to a common accessory.
Hi, sharks.
