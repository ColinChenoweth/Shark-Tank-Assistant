Absolutely.
  To date, we have
  $9.3 million worth of sales.
Herjavec:
  What?!
  whoa!
They don't look
  so stupid now.
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,
or they'll
  walk away with nothing.
I hate this product.
  Oh, my gosh.
People are calling me
  all the time, "Can you send --"
they don't want it!
  They're not buying it!
They are buying it!
This greedy Savage --
  His deal is horrible.
O'Leary: He's never done
  a deal like this.
Excuse me.
  I'm the man.
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went
  from waiting tables in manhattan
to building the city's
  preeminent real-estate empire.
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.
Robert Herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his
  first internet companies
for over $350 million.
is a fashionable way
  to bring out your inner animal.
What's up,
  sharks?
while helping to protect
  endangered animals.
Reow!
That happens every time
  you wear a spirithood.
[ laughter ]
Can we see
  that demo again?
John: Very nice.
But we're more
  than a hat company.
This is
  a traditional spirithood.
There's also a button here
  to secure it to your head.
That Hood actually has built-In
  machine-Washable speakers.
So all you have to do
  is pull your phone out,
you just pull the cord out
  right here,
the era
  of the new fanimal.
All rocking
  their team Spirithoods.
I'm not feeling
  this one.
  So the team spirithood
  line is --
is our latest addition
  to the company.
Do you see
  adults wearing this?
Absolutely.
  Absolutely. Um --
the bulk of our sales
  are to adults.
I don't care who buys them.
  What are the sales?
To date, we have
  $9.3 million worth of sales.
Yeah! That's
  what I'm talking about.
  What?!
whoa!
  Corcoran: Unbelievable.
Good for you guys.
  Come on!
We opened about
  35 different Accounts
we've been carried
  in Fred Segal.
that build around
  Halloween or Christmas,
So, basically,
  we do 70% of our sales
from September
  through December.
What is the price?
  What is the price
  for an average --
So, for a-a-a basic hood
  like that,
our price point
  is $99.
$99?
  John:
  That's a lot.
Now, these -- These
  are synthetic, correct?
These are all faux fur.
So if this sells for $99,
what does it
  cost you to make?
On average, it costs
  about $29 to produce.
Wow.
  That's made -- Made
  in Los Angeles.
Yeah.
  What were your sales
  last year?
I know that you did $9 million
  over three years.
which has
  basically petered out
about $3 million
  steadily every year.
Do you think it's a fad?
  Is that why?
No, I think that --
  I think that --
Well, of course
  it's a fad,
but -- but -- but how
  do you replenish it
we actually had $914,000
  worth of profit.
Last year at $3 million,
  we actually had a --
we had -- We ran into
  some challenges,
into all these
  different markets immediately.
We started
  branching into apparel.
You're hot.
  You want to go with it.
  John: Yeah.
Well, actually,
  our online sales this year
are stronger
  than they were last year.
However, we do see
  a lot of potential for growth.
We just realized
  that we'd need
to lock
  what we do best first.
Somebody must've knocked
  you guys off, right?
  Many.
We have people
  who've literally
tattooed our logos
  on their bodies.
That --
  People are literally
  wanting to pet you,
take pictures with you,
  they want to --
that -- that is
  a big factor of this product.
  Yeah.
It's the only thing
  you could walk into a bar
have maybe about $500,000
  in profit,
but what we really want to do
  is we want to grow the company.
The teams line we see as
  one of the main places
  for large potential.
Guys, let me
  take a shot at it.
I look at it as an interesting
  fashion statement,
but it's not proprietary --
  Anybody can do it.
It scares me to see a year
  $4.5 million down to $3 million,
I mean, great answers
  to all the questions.
You really look like a shark
  right now, Robert.
[ laughter ]
Herjavec:
  I love how you came up with it,
but I actually invested
  in a company
that made really cool things
  like this for helmets.
Mm-hmm.
That worries me about it, but
  there's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing wrong
  with starting a business,
taking out
  a whack of cash...
  Mm-hmm.
You walk into a bar
  with that on,
It really is.
But you know what?
I like to buy into businesses
  that are rising, not falling.
So I'm out.
Yeah.
  All right, thank you.
  Thank you.
There are
  millions of people
who haven't seen
  the product yet,
But the thing
  about it is, I --
It's too expensive
  for me to sell.
What would be a good price point
  for you?
  $19.95.
Then maybe I could sell
  a couple hundred in the Arena,
Yeah, I want to license out
  all categories,
the hats only lasted,
  literally, a year.
Other than that,
  I had to move
an estimate
  of what he's gonna bring in.
  You're not even in
  on this deal!
That's why
  I'm speaking honestly.
You get eaten alive.
  Bad things happen.
[ chuckles ]
  You know,
  you've watched the show.
People have left
  that carpet --
I actually thought
  that was a good offer.
O'Leary: That's
  a very reasonable offer.
Hey, it's a gamble.
  Yeah.
It's a gamble for them,
  not for you.
Why? Are you kidding?
  It's a big gamble
  for him.
Why is it not for me?
  It can easily go to zero.
  Sales are going way down.
Yeah, this thing goes to zero,
  I'm out of $450,000, Barbara.
You don't think
  that's a gamble?
We're not prepared to evaluate
  our company that low,
but what
  we are prepared to do
is give a $2 million evaluation
  for 22.5%,
but then a particular percentage
  on licensing deals
that you bring
  into the situation.
Okay, well, I mean,
  that's the beauty of the tank.
When you go out to think,
  I start to think,
So I wasn't ready
  to renegotiate the deal.
I'm out.
Thank you guys.
  Thank you.
We appreciate
  the opportunity.
  Appreciate it.
Good luck, guys.
  Yeah, take it easy.
Herjavec:
  Thanks, guys.
Information
  is the most valuable commodity.
The kingonomic conference
  aims to give entrepreneurs --
Primarily
  minority entrepreneurs --
I'm somebody who benefited
off of supporting
  of minority entrepreneurship,
Cuban:
  Maybe not everybody knows --
the sharks have nothing to do
  with who comes on the show.
All we really know
  is their first name
when they walk
  into the Shark Tank.
So, tell me Real quick --
What's the name of your company,
  how much are you looking for?
Salvers: We are here
  at the kingonomics conference.
We're looking
  for great businesses,
great products,
  great ideas for "Shark Tank."
If you had the restroom kit,
we like to talk about,
"Oh, it's all about the money,"
but it's not always
  about the money.
There's so many different ways
  to impact the world,
to transport you
  to an alternate reality.
The first-Ever
  virtual-Reality platform
that allows you to be
  truly a part of the video game.
The Omni is
  an Omnidirectional treadmill,
but we removed
  all the moving parts.
It's basically
  a low-friction surface
on which the user walks
  with these special shoes
that have
  a low-friction sole.
Steve will also
  put on a support belt,
which provides safety.
You can't fall
  on the Omni.
Also provides some support
that uses keyboard input.
Once you're in the Omni,
you can put on
  the virtual-reality glasses.
Oh, cool.
  This is right up
  your alley.
The Omni enables you
  to walk...
run...
jump...
Virtual reality
  has never broken through
because the technology
  wasn't ready.
That's
  all changing now.
The technology is here,
  the Omni is here,
so which of you sharks
  want to be on the forefront
of this
  virtual-reality revolution?
Robert, you look excited.
  Would you like to try it out?
I'd love to try it out.
  Absolutely.
Whose glasses
  are you using?
All right.
  Now, I'm gonna set up
  the kinect.
What's it like
  in there, Robert?
It's very cool.
So, Robert,
  the gun is just a trigger,
so you aim
  where your look.
Corcoran: All right.
  Oh, what a relief. My God.
  It's very cool.
Feels very, very immersive.
  How much is it?
'cause usually they have a
  side job as a plus-Sized model,
most guys who are --
  Who play games.
  [ laughter ]
Yeah. Well, nobody likes
  being overweight.
People would like to
  be fit, but gamers, they
  don't like to exercise.
People are excited
  about this.
  Corcoran: Is that the way
  you're positioning it --
as a weight-loss machine,
  as well?
Is that
  what you're thinking?
  A-a-Absolutely.
But there's
  a bigger issue, right?
This is pretty much based
  around Oculus Rift, right?
As Oculus Rift goes,
  you guys go.
Can you tell me what that is,
  Oculus Rift?
That's the headset.
The rift
  is basically what started
this virtual-reality
  revolution.
Cuban: They've done a phenomenal
  job of allowing you
John: No, really?
  $300.
Is the gun included?
The gun is off-The-Shelf.
  You can buy it online.
It sounds like it's gonna be
  an $800-To-$900 cost,
which is quite a bit.
Why don't you tell us why
  you're worth $20 million today?
That's a ridiculous valuation
  for this.
Let me walk you
  through the numbers.
The rift is an analog
  for our product.
Same target market,
  same people.
They're selling 200 of these
  per day right now.
They project to do 500,000 units
  in sales next year.
If we convert 1 out of 20 buyers
  of the rift,
well, we would be selling
  25,000 units next year,
which is $12 1/2 million
  in sales.
Herjavec: There's a fundamental
  difference, though.
When I buy the head gear,
You want me to pay your value
  two years from now today.
Corcoran:
  Here's my thinking on it.
I also think it's a tremendous
  problem to sell this in retail.
I sell a lot of product now
  through retail.
I couldn't get anybody
  to give the floor space to this.
You'd pay so much
  just to demonstrate it.
But I think
  that's a concern.
You have to realize
that 50% of the population
  is married,
I-I see the market, but I also
  don't see somebody playing this
more than an hour
  or a half an hour a day
before they can't even play
  it anymore 'cause they're out
  of breath or they're tired.
They just won't revisit it.
But I think I'm an anomaly.
You'd better talk to your wife.
  She's not a pushover.
Well, we have a big house,
  Barbara. She'll never see it.
But I don't think that people
  want to exercise
I think if people really wanted
  to immerse themselves that way,
I think they'll go outside.
I-I don't buy the premise.
  I'm out.
O'Leary: I see
  where you're going with it,
but it is a subsegment
  of a subsegment market,
"is this a good deal
  at $20 million
where you are right now?"
You've got tons of risk --
  All kinds of risk.
I hate deals like that.
I hate it
  when you make me pay
for two years from now
  if everything works today.
Why would I do that?
I'm not an idiot.
  Why would I do that?
Because of the potential.
O'Leary:
  You are going to have problems.
Poo-Poo's gonna happen,
  my friend,
I could see you creating
  $20 million in sales,
$25 million in sales with this,
but you're competing just like
  headsets are gonna be competing,
just like the consoles
  are gonna be competing.
You're one more -- one
  more outlet competing
  for consumer dollars.
You have to push that ball
  so hard to keep going.
You haven't told me
that there's a way
  to get to $50 million in sales.
completely new technology
  that blows all this away.
For those reasons,
  I'm out.
If you had put this
  at a $5 million valuation,
it would've been
  very interesting.
Good luck.
Anybody that pays $20 million
  for that is insane.
Gamers are lazy,
  like most human beings.
They don't want to exercise.
No, they don't.
Narrator:
  Next into the tank are two moms
  from Bayonne, New Jersey,
with a cooler way
  to keep kids safe.
Herjavec:
  [ laughs ]
Cuban: Cool.
Cute kids.
  Very cool.
Sharks, just about
  every parent can relate
to the struggle
  that you face
when you try to get your child
  to wear their safety helmet.
It's a fight.
  Why?
Well, safety helmets
  are not perceived as being cool.
They're clunky,
  plain, boring.
So we took
  something ordinary,
Originally inspired
  by my daughter Maya,
Fohawx! Are decorative, funky
  foam helmet accessories
that come in a variety
So kids
  can collect them all,
or they can swap
  with their friends.
that get kids excited
  about safety gear
because with Fohawx!,
  safety has never looked so cool.
Very cool.
  Together: Thanks, guys.
Say Bye to the sharks.
  Good job.
Herjavec:
  Bye, guys. Bye, girls.
Cuban: Bye.
  Bye, kids.
What's different about --
Okay, what really differentiates
  us is the versat--
versatility
  of this project -- Product.
  In what sense?
The -- the fact is that
  it can attach to any helmet.
This is something that kids --
  Really excite kids
because there's
  sort of limitless styles
that we could come up with.
we've sold
  about 5,000 units
Um, we are in over 80
  specialty retail toy stores
across the United States.
We are also in test mode
with two of the biggest
  mass-market retailers
They have not pushed back
  on the price.
  From walmart, you're saying?
Walmart has -- has not pushed
  back on the price, which --
So they're okay
  with a $20 retail price?
Exactly.
  I don't think so.
  Yeah, that's
  hard to believe.
Yeah, there's no --
  is there competition for it?
Sure, there is.
  You kidding?
  There is no --
  We want to be sold --
Okay.
  Also, a bike shop.
O'Leary: There's
  tons of competition.
  But we want to be in every
  mass-market retailer.
We're talking about Toys "R" Us,
  Walmart, Target --
  It's -- Yeah.
Why -- Why are your sales
  so low?
They're all
  gonna get delisted.
There's no way on earth
  a retailer's gonna keep that in
with such small velocity.
That's tiny.
  What's happening?
  Well, we envision --
No, no. Go there. Tell me
  your idea about licensing.
  Why?
Because we really see that this
  is -- This is what kids want.
They asked us
  for this product.
They don't want it!
  They're not buying it!
Maybe people
  don't want to buy them.
Well, that -- We haven't
  had that experience.
No, just -- That's
  just not possible.
Look, you're on fire.
  You're burning.
You have to figure out
  what's wrong
We were still talking, Barbara.
  You're interrupting.
  Excuse me.
I can't get a word in here.
  I'm still talking.
  You're interrupting.
Just pipe down.
  No, I'm not interrupting.
  I want to know one thing.
I'm getting --
  I'm getting a word in.
  Can I finish my --
  Can I finish my statement?
You've got a minute.
  Go ahead.
Have you set it up
  at $9.99 or done --
Or done flash sales to see
  how people respond at $9.99?
We did do
  a few partnerships
with some of
  the hot flash-Sale websites,
but not when it negates
  fact that's all around you.
You've got to face the reality
  that all the signs are saying,
"It's a problem, it's a problem,
  it's a problem,"
but you're too blind
  to see it.
So --
  So what are you
  gonna do, Barbara?
But I don't --
  I'm out for sure.
We are absolutely --
We are absolutely committed
  to making this.
That's not enough.
  That's -- That's not enough.
That's not good.
  Yeah, but there's --
Everybody who walks
  into the Shark Tank
is fully committed.
That's why they're here.
  Okay.
It takes more than that
  to be successful.
We are two moms trying
  to create this company.
We need somebody
  who can talk to China.
We want expertise in
  global expansion, licensing --
[ laughs ]
  Oh, lordy.
  O'Leary: Why?
They're asking for it.
  We've had --
  You haven't even conquered
  New Jersey.
What are you worried
  about the globe for?
The market
  wants this now.
People are calling me
  all the time, "Can you send --"
why don't they buy it?
  We've had
  international distributors.
They are buying it!
  Well, why doesn't it
  show up in the numbers?
What would you -- What would --
  what would've made you happy?
What are you
  looking for?
  Cuban:
  No, actually, wait. No.
Here's what would've
  made it happen.
A million dollars?
  Herjavec: No, no.
This is what would've
  made us happy.
If you would've said,
  "We had one store,
We really feel like this is
  the beginning for us.
I appreciate what you're saying,
  but for us,
we really are just --
Our momentum is just
  really starting now.
I hope so.
I'm out.
Okay.
Daymond,
  let's do this together.
Let's -- You want
  to sell them at $9.99?
Let's do it together.
It's not about the sales
  that we're upset about.
Herjavec:
  Is there anybody left?
Well, yes, there is.
  Mister --
[ laughs ]
  Oh, Mr. Wonderful,
  I can't wait to hear this.
[ laughter ]
I don't know
  what you're gonna do.
I really don't know,
because you're on the path,
  right now, to zero.
Well, we came here today
  prepared to make a deal,
All right,
  you're missing out.
  Okay, thank you.
John: Good luck.
  Good luck, guys.
  Cuban: Good luck, guys.
I was rookie of the year.
  I was an all-Pro.
That was my job then,
  but barbecue is my passion.
So, how we doing over here?
  Fantastic.
After my NFL career, I opened up
  my own barbecue restaurant,
things don't always go according
  to your game plan,
I'm al "Bubba" Baker
  from Avon, Ohio,
owner of the de-boned
  baby back rib steaks.
I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange for 15% equity
  in my company,
Now, I played a little football
  in the NFL for 13 years.
That was my job.
  Barbecue is my passion.
Sadly, I married a woman
  that doesn't like ribs
because they're too messy.
So I vowed to find a way
for my wife
  to be able to enjoy ribs.
But how do you make ribs
  less messy?
You take the bones out.
  [ laughs ]
After 20 years,
  I found the perfect method,
We are the only people
  that have removed the bones
from an actual slab of Rib,
  leaving the meat intact
Our de-boned baby back rib steak
is not pieces of meat
  formed in the shape of a rib,
if you know what I mean.
[ laughs ]
  you tell them, Bubba.
Boneless meats are
  the way of the future,
Make no bones about it, sharks.
  It's time for some ribs.
John: Yeah.
  It's always time
  for ribs.
All right, Bubba. Bless me
  with the Bubba baby back.
[ laughs ]
Cuban:
  Bubba, who'd you play for?
Well, I played for the lions.
I was rookie of the year
  in 1978.
I played for
  the then-St. Louis cardinals,
This is really,
  really Good.
  Thank you. Thank you.
So, basically -- I just want
  to be really, really clear.
I buy this, I throw it in the
  microwave for two minutes --
cowboy rib eye,
  bone-In rib eye --
Some people actually believe
that the bone
  just tastes better.
That's a great point.
We cook the product
  with the bone in it,
then we remove the bones,
  then we quick-chill it,
about how
  you're removing the bone,
or are you
  genetically altering cows
So they grow up
  with no ribs?
[ laughter ]
  actually, it's pigs.
  Kevin, it's hogs.
Okay, So, why couldn't I
  just do the same thing?
Well, um...
I'm not gonna
  run from any questions.
  Literally.
Right here, Kevin,
is the patent
  for the product,
Here. Take them both
  to them.
So, nobody else Can make
  boneless ribs?
Let me be more specific.
No one else can make
  a fully cooked rib
with either one or more
  bones removed from it.
Wow.
You got a patent
  for it, Bubba.
You can tell him.
  Yeah, tell me.
Baker: Robert, honestly,
  there's the patent,
then there's the know-How,
Herjavec:
  Al, what are your sales
Okay, our sales
  are $154,000.
Over what period?
Over a year's period.
We're selling
  in about 48 stores.
You said it took you
  20 years to develop this,
I actually am an investor
in a restaurant chain
  with 450 locations
that sells
  a ton of protein,
Here's the big problem
  with your deal right now.
You're asking for $2 million
  valuation on this thing.
You're not making any money.
The only value here
  is in the patent.
This reminds me of a story
  that's so relevant to you.
I love stories.
The first season
  of "Shark Tank,"
a guy stood
  right where you are.
He had
  a folding-neck guitar.
He wanted to build out
  a guitar company.
The only thing of value
was the patent
  on the folding-Neck technology.
You know where
  we are today?
  Where are you at?
They are licensing
  that technology
on Fender Bender guitars
  all around the world.
He's gonna be rich.
Listen to
  what I'm saying to you.
A patent on a food product --
  That's interesting.
All around the world,
  pigs are walking around saying,
"Stop the senseless slaughter,"
  because of this one guy.
[ laughs ]
So, my offer is very simple.
  I'll give you the $300,000.
It's contingent on getting
one of the large
  meat processors in america
to license the patent.
But I want 49%.
That's the deal.
Narrator:
  All five sharks are still in.
Kevin has made an offer
  of $300,000,
contingent on a licensing deal
  with a large meat processor.
But he wants
  49% of Al's company.
That's the first time
  Kevin actually has a decent idea
when it comes to
  something like this.
It's the first time
we've heard his stupid idea
  making any sense.
John:
  That idea is so brilliant,
I'll do the exact same deal,
  but I'll only take 30%.
Bam, Kevin!
This greedy savage --
  His deal is horrible.
O'Leary: He's never done
  a deal like this.
If you talk to
  the guy that owns --
  I've licensed plenty.
Al, let me
  clear it up for you.
  Yeah, okay.
I think you're paying
  a very expensive price
for somebody
  to make a phone call for you
that you could do
  on your own.
I'm out.
Barbara?
I would have pitched you
that I should bring you
  to some of the big-box stores,
some of the club channels,
  like B.J.'s, Costco,
but I happen to think
  some of the offers on the table
are better, so I'm out.
  Okay.
Thank you.
  Cuban: I'm kind of
  in the same boat.
I think you need to
  fatten up the hog some
before it's ready to go.
For me, the business would
  have to be a little bit bigger.
That's why you're limited
  kind of to the licensing play.
So, for those reasons,
  I'm out.
Okay.
Herjavec:
  Al, you got two offers.
  Yeah.
Both licensing deals.
Al, is this the path
  that you want to go down?
All around the world.
I'm the man.
You've got the real deal,
  or you've got the
  discount license guy.
Day 1, you're not
  taking a check,
but I think I'm gonna
