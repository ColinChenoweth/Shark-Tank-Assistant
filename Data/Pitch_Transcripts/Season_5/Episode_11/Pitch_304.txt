Absolutely.
  To date, we have
  $9.3 million worth of sales.
Herjavec:
  What?!
  whoa!
They don't look
  so stupid now.
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,
or they'll
  walk away with nothing.
I hate this product.
  Oh, my gosh.
People are calling me
  all the time, "Can you send --"
they don't want it!
  They're not buying it!
They are buying it!
You've got to wake up
  and smell the bankruptcy, okay?
[ laughter ]
  Narrator: If the sharks
  hear a great idea...
reow!
Narrator:
  ...they're ready to invest...
Oh, wow!
...using their own money.
I want 50%.
Narrator: And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece
  of the action.
This greedy Savage --
  His deal is horrible.
O'Leary: He's never done
  a deal like this.
Excuse me.
  I'm the man.
And I want you and I
  to de-Bone this pig together.
[ laughs ]
and then what -- what would you
  see for the brand itself?
Money.
Narrator:
  Who are the sharks?
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went
  from waiting tables in manhattan
to building the city's
  preeminent real-estate empire.
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert
Who grew
  his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand Fubu,
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.
Robert Herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his
  first internet companies
for over $350 million.
And Mark Cuban -- notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,
tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
is a fashionable way
  to bring out your inner animal.
What's up,
  sharks?
while helping to protect
  endangered animals.
Reow!
That happens every time
  you wear a spirithood.
[ laughter ]
Can we see
  that demo again?
John: Very nice.
But we're more
  than a hat company.
We're
  a lifestyle brand.
And as a brand, we're about
  community, self-Expression,
and just all around
  having a good time.
We have products for adults,
  kids, and sports markets.
This is
  a traditional spirithood.
It has paws
  for your hands...
Cuban:
  [ laughing ]
  Corcoran:
  Oh, my gosh.
Oh, yeah.
  ...sleeves that can
  be turned into a scarf.
John:
  Oh, my God.
Ooh, nice, thank you.
It can worn up,
  it can be worn down.
There's also a button here
  to secure it to your head.
And then,
  on the inside,
there's a hidden
  secret zipper pocket.
That Hood actually has built-In
  machine-Washable speakers.
So all you have to do
  is pull your phone out,
you just pull the cord out
  right here,
press play, and you've
  got music in your head.
Wait, wait.
  I'm chopped liver?
[ whistles ]
introducing,
  ladies and gentlemen,
the era
  of the new fanimal.
Picture in the stands
  30,000 fans
All rocking
  their team Spirithoods.
I'm not feeling
  this one.
  So the team spirithood
  line is --
is our latest addition
  to the company.
Do you see
  adults wearing this?
Absolutely.
  Absolutely. Um --
the bulk of our sales
  are to adults.
I don't care who buys them.
  What are the sales?
To date, we have
  $9.3 million worth of sales.
Yeah! That's
  what I'm talking about.
  What?!
whoa!
  Corcoran: Unbelievable.
Good for you guys.
  Come on!
We opened about
  35 different Accounts
both domestically
  and internationally, and --
any of
  the major accounts?
We are currently in Zappos,
  Nordstrom's online, in Harrods,
we've been carried
  in Fred Segal.
And is this
  a seasonal sales
that build around
  Halloween or Christmas,
and then you kind of tail off
  the rest of the year?
Well, the cold --
  The cold-weather months
  are our months.
So, basically,
  we do 70% of our sales
from September
  through December.
What is the price?
  What is the price
  for an average --
So, for a-a-a basic hood
  like that,
our price point
  is $99.
$99?
  John:
  That's a lot.
Now, these -- These
  are synthetic, correct?
These are all faux fur.
So if this sells for $99,
what does it
  cost you to make?
On average, it costs
  about $29 to produce.
Wow.
  That's made -- Made
  in Los Angeles.
Yeah.
  What were your sales
  last year?
I know that you did $9 million
  over three years.
What were they last year
  and the year before?
The first year, we had
  $1 million that we launched,
and the second year,
  we had $4.5 million in sales.
And then the third year,
  we had $3 million.
Oh. Ooh.
Hmm.
  And we're on track
  to do $3 million again.
O'Leary: What happened?
  What happened?
We had a big explosion,
  a lot of early adapters,
and then after that, we were
  left with a core business,
which has
  basically petered out
about $3 million
  steadily every year.
Do you think it's a fad?
  Is that why?
No, I think that --
  I think that --
Well, of course
  it's a fad,
but -- but -- but how
  do you replenish it
and refresh this, right?
It was a trend
within the contemporary
  women's fashion market, yes.
But, again,
  we expand --
Many different markets,
  into
but we have a core business
  that was left from that
that followed
  the brand,
because they love
  what we stand for, what we do.
You never finished off
  your profitability.
You did $4.5 million
  your best year.
How much did you make
  that year?
So the year where we made
  $4.5 million,
we actually had $914,000
  worth of profit.
John: Wow.
  And what about last year
  at $3 million?
Last year at $3 million,
  we actually had a --
we had -- We ran into
  some challenges,
and we had
  a $500,000 loss.
John: Mm.
  Whoa.
Corcoran: Wow.
  $500,000
  or $600,000 loss?
Herjavec: Why?
  Sounds like
  you got skinned that year.
[ laughs ]
  Yeah, yeah.
  We got skinned for sure.
We hired
  a lot of people
because we wanted
  to expand
into all these
  different markets immediately.
We started
  branching into apparel.
You're hot.
  You want to go with it.
  John: Yeah.
We went --
  We went -- and We went
too big
  for our own britches.
But what we've now done
  is cut our costs,
focused on what we do best,
  which is this,
and, you know,
  you had mentioned that,
okay, it's
  a downward trend.
Well, actually,
  our online sales this year
are stronger
  than they were last year.
However, we do see
  a lot of potential for growth.
We just realized
  that we'd need
to lock
  what we do best first.
Somebody must've knocked
  you guys off, right?
  Many.
We have people
  who've literally
tattooed our logos
  on their bodies.
And I'm saying
  multiple.
Like, that's how fanatic
  our -- our tribe is.
I've never seen a product
  that elicits a response
  like this.
That --
  People are literally
  wanting to pet you,
take pictures with you,
  they want to --
that -- that is
  a big factor of this product.
  Yeah.
It's the only thing
  you could walk into a bar
and girls come up to you
  and start petting you.
And what do you want to use
  the $450,000 for?
We could stay
  right now
with a viable
  $3-million business,
pay off Our debt
  next year,
have maybe about $500,000
  in profit,
but what we really want to do
  is we want to grow the company.
The teams line we see as
  one of the main places
  for large potential.
Guys, let me
  take a shot at it.
I look at it as an interesting
  fashion statement,
but it's not proprietary --
  Anybody can do it.
It scares me to see a year
  $4.5 million down to $3 million,
and then you're gonna
  build it up in a new Category.
Look, I'm not gonna take
  the ride with you. I'm out.
Good business, guys.
I mean, great answers
  to all the questions.
You really look like a shark
  right now, Robert.
[ laughter ]
Herjavec:
  I love how you came up with it,
but I actually invested
  in a company
that made really cool things
  like this for helmets.
Mm-hmm.
And here's
  what happened to us.
Two years,
  we were on fire...
and then the sales
  went completely away.
  Mm-hmm.
That worries me about it, but
  there's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing wrong
  with starting a business,
taking out
  a whack of cash...
  Mm-hmm.
...and then
  starting something else.
Mm-hmm.
I'm out.
Thank you.
  You look good in it.
[ Laughter ]
  can I keep it?
Absolutely.
Corcoran: I think
  the best use of it,
you mentioned earlier,
  is as a chick magnet.
You walk into a bar
  with that on,
I'm gonna go over to you and
  think you're an adorable guy.
[ purrs ]
  I'm not sure
  I'm gonna want to date you...
wow.
  ...but it's
  a great chick magnet.
It really is.
But you know what?
I like to buy into businesses
  that are rising, not falling.
So I'm out.
Yeah.
  All right, thank you.
  Thank you.
There are
  millions of people
who haven't seen
  the product yet,
and that's one of the reasons
  why we're here.
Guys, you've got
  a nice little business, right?
But the thing
  about it is, I --
It's too expensive
  for me to sell.
What would be a good price point
  for you?
  $19.95.
Then maybe I could sell
  a couple hundred in the Arena,
and you'll see
  some folks walking around.
And I-I don't think
  you can get the price point
where I can help you
  in sports,
and I just don't see it,
  so I'm out.
And you're left with the only
  shark that matters in this case.
[ laughter ]
  Daymond is still here.
Thank you for the pressure,
  Rob. How --
  Herjavec: Bang.
And he loves
  this kind of stuff.
  How colorful.
Daymond, the fashion guy
  who started with hats.
Did he
  say that?
  I know!
  I know!
John: I did.
  Oh, we know that.
We've done
  our research.
  Yeah, yeah.
You know, and I would like
  to draw a comparison,
because you know what it's like
  to have an idea
and see something
  in the market
and pound the streets,
  put it on your friends.
You know, we did
  the same type of thing.
We got celebrity exposure.
  The brand grew.
We've been on Bruno Mars,
  Snoop Dogg, ke$ha, Kardashians,
Justin Bieber --
  The list goes on.
Here's the --
  the bigger problem.
This brand
  and this -- this category
are hot for a second,
  is down-Trending.
I would have to take
  a gamble with you,
and it would be --
  it would be --
Let's take a risk.
  Let's do it together.
Well, I don't know if you'll
  want to take the risk with me,
because my risk
  is gonna be $450,000,
and we're gonna license
  this thing out, and I want 50%.
50%.
Ba-bam.
Whoo-Wee!
Narrator:
  Four sharks are out.
Yeah, I want to license out
  all categories,
and the pricing
  will have to come down.
I want outerwear, backpacks,
and we want to try to find
  licenses for that
and get that out there
  to support the brand.
You see, when I first started
  making hats,
the hats only lasted,
  literally, a year.
Other than that,
  I had to move
into outerwear and t-Shirts
  and Denim and everything else,
because the hats
  were in and out --
  they were gone.
Yeah.
And then what -- what would you
  see for the brand itself?
Money.
[ laughter ]
Guys, you've got a really nice
  warm and fuzzy offer here.
That's not
  a warm and fuzzy offer.
Yes, it is.
  $450,000 cash.
  You know
  what it's missing?
Barbara,
  shut your pie hole.
You know what it's --
  Barbara's not in this!
  Barbara is not in this.
You know what it's missing?
  It's missing any promise,
any conciseness of how much
  he expects to make for you.
He hasn't given you
  a single number.
He risked $450,000!
  And yet he wants --
if he's so good
  at what he's doing,
he should be able
  to give you
an estimate
  of what he's gonna bring in.
  You're not even in
  on this deal!
That's why
  I'm speaking honestly.
Can we have a moment to go back
  and talk for a little bit?
  Two seconds?
You know what happens when you
  go back and talk, right?
What happens?
You get eaten alive.
  Bad things happen.
[ chuckles ]
  You know,
  you've watched the show.
People have left
  that carpet --
don't worry about it.
  Leave the ladies here,
  and go ahead out.
[ Laughter ]
  Thank you.
  Appreciate it.
So, $435,000.
And he's gonna license it out
  into everything else,
and then who knows
what's gonna happen
  to the brand name?
Do we want him
  to just take our brand
and license it out
  to all these different people?
I actually thought
  that was a good offer.
O'Leary: That's
  a very reasonable offer.
Hey, it's a gamble.
  Yeah.
It's a gamble for them,
  not for you.
Why? Are you kidding?
  It's a big gamble
  for him.
Why is it not for me?
  It can easily go to zero.
  Sales are going way down.
Yeah, this thing goes to zero,
  I'm out of $450,000, Barbara.
You don't think
  that's a gamble?
We're not prepared to evaluate
  our company that low,
but what
  we are prepared to do
is give a $2 million evaluation
  for 22.5%,
but then a particular percentage
  on licensing deals
that you bring
  into the situation.
Okay, well, I mean,
  that's the beauty of the tank.
When you go out to think,
  I start to think,
and I already have
  buyer's remorse,
and I didn't even buy it.
So I wasn't ready
  to renegotiate the deal.
I'm out.
Thank you guys.
  Thank you.
We appreciate
  the opportunity.
  Appreciate it.
Good luck, guys.
  Yeah, take it easy.
Herjavec:
  Thanks, guys.
and get fired up
  about starting companies,
running companies,
  and hopefully making some money.
Information
  is the most valuable commodity.
The kingonomic conference
  aims to give entrepreneurs --
Primarily
  minority entrepreneurs --
access to capital
  and information
on how to build
  a successful business.
I'm somebody who benefited
off of supporting
  of minority entrepreneurship,
and now I can help others.
[ cheers and Applause ]
  Daymond,
  thank you.
Woman: welcome to
  "Shark Tank" Casting.
Thanks for having us here.
Cuban:
  Maybe not everybody knows --
the sharks have nothing to do
  with who comes on the show.
All we really know
  is their first name
when they walk
  into the Shark Tank.
So, tell me Real quick --
What's the name of your company,
  how much are you looking for?
Salvers: We are here
  at the kingonomics conference.
We're looking
  for great businesses,
great products,
  great ideas for "Shark Tank."
If you had the restroom kit,
you have everything you need
  right in your hand.
Cuban:
  You know, on "Shark Tank,"
we like to talk about,
"Oh, it's all about the money,"
but it's not always
  about the money.
There's so many different ways
  to impact the world,
and if we can give someone
  the confidence
to have their dreams come True,
  then it's a good day,
and we've accomplished
  something to be proud of.
John:
  Entrepreneurship resonates with
  minorities for many reasons,
but the good thing is there's
  no color when making money.
And everybody can be a part
  of the American dream.
Narrator: Next into the tank
  is a high-tech way
to transport you
  to an alternate reality.
The first-Ever
  virtual-Reality platform
that allows you to be
  truly a part of the video game.
The Omni is
  an Omnidirectional treadmill,
but we removed
  all the moving parts.
It's basically
  a low-friction surface
on which the user walks
  with these special shoes
that have
  a low-friction sole.
Steve will also
  put on a support belt,
which provides safety.
You can't fall
  on the Omni.
Also provides some support
so you can use
  the Omni hands-free
so you can hold a controller
  or a gun in your hands.
The Omni can be played
  with Any existing game
that uses keyboard input.
Once you're in the Omni,
you can put on
  the virtual-reality glasses.
Oh, cool.
  This is right up
  your alley.
The Omni enables you
  to walk...
run...
jump...
and crouch
  in 360 degrees,
and put your mind and your body
  into the video game
to transport you
  into a different world.
[ gunfire, explosions ]
Cuban: Cool.
  John: Wow.
Virtual reality
  has never broken through
because the technology
  wasn't ready.
That's
  all changing now.
The technology is here,
  the Omni is here,
so which of you sharks
  want to be on the forefront
of this
  virtual-reality revolution?
Robert, you look excited.
  Would you like to try it out?
I'd love to try it out.
  Absolutely.
Whose glasses
  are you using?
All right.
  Now, I'm gonna set up
  the kinect.
What's it like
  in there, Robert?
It's very cool.
So, Robert,
  the gun is just a trigger,
so you aim
  where your look.
And there's a --
  Oh, very cool.
[ gunshots ]
  Oh, wow!
Oh, Gee!
  Cuban:
  Run, gerbil, run.
Look,
  he's back in Croatia!
[ Laughter ]
  Kevin, come out and play.
  Kevin!
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: All right.
  Oh, what a relief. My God.
  It's very cool.
Feels very, very immersive.
  How much is it?
'cause usually they have a
  side job as a plus-Sized model,
most guys who are --
  Who play games.
  [ laughter ]
Yeah. Well, nobody likes
  being overweight.
People would like to
  be fit, but gamers, they
  don't like to exercise.
Now we can play games
  and lose weight and Burn
  calories at the same time.
People are excited
  about this.
  Corcoran: Is that the way
  you're positioning it --
as a weight-loss machine,
  as well?
Is that
  what you're thinking?
  A-a-Absolutely.
But there's
  a bigger issue, right?
This is pretty much based
  around Oculus Rift, right?
As Oculus Rift goes,
  you guys go.
Can you tell me what that is,
  Oculus Rift?
That's the headset.
The rift
  is basically what started
this virtual-reality
  revolution.
Cuban: They've done a phenomenal
  job of allowing you
to put on a headset
  and be in an immersive world.
Is that included
  in the price?
It's not included
  in the price.
  Herjavec: Oh, it's not?
Corcoran: So what do you pay
  for that headset?
John: No, really?
  $300.
Is the gun included?
The gun is off-The-Shelf.
  You can buy it online.
It sounds like it's gonna be
  an $800-To-$900 cost,
which is quite a bit.
Why don't you tell us why
  you're worth $20 million today?
That's a ridiculous valuation
  for this.
Let me walk you
  through the numbers.
The rift is an analog
  for our product.
Same target market,
  same people.
They're selling 200 of these
  per day right now.
They project to do 500,000 units
  in sales next year.
If we convert 1 out of 20 buyers
  of the rift,
well, we would be selling
  25,000 units next year,
which is $12 1/2 million
  in sales.
Herjavec: There's a fundamental
  difference, though.
When I buy the head gear,
I can still sit around
  and lounge.
You're forcing me to stand,
and you're forcing me
  to be interactive.
I don't think people
  want to be that interactive.
I sold 3,000 units
  just without a product yet.
You want me to pay your value
  two years from now today.
Corcoran:
  Here's my thinking on it.
If my husband
  brought this into my house,
I would divorce him immediately.
[ laughs ]
  I think it's a problem
  because of its size in the home.
I also think it's a tremendous
  problem to sell this in retail.
I sell a lot of product now
  through retail.
I couldn't get anybody
  to give the floor space to this.
You'd pay so much
  just to demonstrate it.
But I think
  that's a concern.
You have to realize
that 50% of the population
  is married,
and they're gonna have to deal
  with their wife on this one.
So I'm out.
John:
  You know, I see the market.
You know,
  "Black Ops" Did amazing.
"Grand Theft Auto," right?
  Breaking records.
I-I see the market, but I also
  don't see somebody playing this
more than an hour
  or a half an hour a day
before they can't even play
  it anymore 'cause they're out
  of breath or they're tired.
They just won't revisit it.
So for all those reasons
  and more, I'm out.
Look, great product.
  I will definitely buy one.
But I think I'm an anomaly.
You'd better talk to your wife.
  She's not a pushover.
Well, we have a big house,
  Barbara. She'll never see it.
But I don't think that people
  want to exercise
and immerse themselves in
  a physical world to that degree.
I think if people really wanted
  to immerse themselves that way,
I think they'll go outside.
I-I don't buy the premise.
  I'm out.
O'Leary: I see
  where you're going with it,
but it is a subsegment
  of a subsegment market,
and it's very expensive.
I look at it and say to myself,
"is this a good deal
  at $20 million
where you are right now?"
and the answer is
  No, it's not.
There's too much risk
between your delivery
  of a consumer product,
a retail-Distribution strategy,
  and your sales.
You've got tons of risk --
  All kinds of risk.
And I got to pay
  Tomorrow's price today.
I hate deals like that.
I hate it
  when you make me pay
for two years from now
  if everything works today.
Why would I do that?
I'm not an idiot.
  Why would I do that?
Because of the potential.
O'Leary:
  You are going to have problems.
Poo-Poo's gonna happen,
  my friend,
and I have to pay
  for that now?
No. It's an outrage.
  Ridiculous. I'm out.
I get what you're doing.
I could see you creating
  $20 million in sales,
$25 million in sales with this,
but you're competing just like
  headsets are gonna be competing,
just like the consoles
  are gonna be competing.
You're one more -- one
  more outlet competing
  for consumer dollars.
You have to push that ball
  so hard to keep going.
You haven't told me
that there's a way
  to get to $50 million in sales.
And in six years,
  there's gonna be
completely new technology
  that blows all this away.
For those reasons,
  I'm out.
If you had put this
  at a $5 million valuation,
it would've been
  very interesting.
Good luck.
Anybody that pays $20 million
  for that is insane.
Gamers are lazy,
  like most human beings.
They don't want to exercise.
No, they don't.
Narrator:
  Next into the tank are two moms
  from Bayonne, New Jersey,
with a cooler way
  to keep kids safe.
Herjavec:
  [ laughs ]
Cuban: Cool.
Cute kids.
  Very cool.
Sharks, just about
  every parent can relate
to the struggle
  that you face
when you try to get your child
  to wear their safety helmet.
It's a fight.
  Why?
Well, safety helmets
  are not perceived as being cool.
They're clunky,
  plain, boring.
So we took
  something ordinary,
and we've made it
  extraordinary.
Originally inspired
  by my daughter Maya,
Fohawx! Are decorative, funky
  foam helmet accessories
that come in a variety
of outrageous colors
  and styles.
Each and every Fohawx!
Comes with its own
  self-adhesive velcro strip
so it can easily be...
removed and...
  reattached.
Will it work
  on Kevin's head?
[ laughter ]
so you can remove it
and reattach it
  to any safety helmet.
So kids
  can collect them all,
or they can swap
  with their friends.
The Fohawx! Brand
  will continue
to design and develop
  products
that get kids excited
  about safety gear
because with Fohawx!,
  safety has never looked so cool.
Very cool.
  Together: Thanks, guys.
Say Bye to the sharks.
  Good job.
Herjavec:
  Bye, guys. Bye, girls.
Cuban: Bye.
  Bye, kids.
What's different about --
Okay, what really differentiates
  us is the versat--
versatility
  of this project -- Product.
  In what sense?
The -- the fact is that
  it can attach to any helmet.
This is something that kids --
  Really excite kids
because there's
  sort of limitless styles
that we could come up with.
We can --
  what do you make it for,
  and what do you sell it for?
We make it for $5.
  That's packaged and landed.
A good
  price.
  Oh.
Yes, and our msrp
  is $19.99.
And how many have you sold?
  Where have you sold them?
Since we started selling,
  which was just over a year ago,
we've sold
  about 5,000 units
and generated
  $50,000 in sales.
  How?
Um, we are in over 80
  specialty retail toy stores
across the United States.
We are also in test mode
with two of the biggest
  mass-market retailers
in the world --
  Toys "R" Us and Walmart.
Not in retail --
  Online.
Not in retail, but as some
  of you probably know,
the mass-Market retailers
like to test your products
  a little bit beforehand.
  Right.
Online.
  John:
  They're gonna want --
they're gonna want this thing
  at $9.99, aren't they?
Well, you know,
  we have had no pushback
from any of the buyers.
They have not pushed back
  on the price.
  From walmart, you're saying?
Walmart has -- has not pushed
  back on the price, which --
So they're okay
  with a $20 retail price?
Exactly.
  I don't think so.
  Yeah, that's
  hard to believe.
Yeah, there's no --
  is there competition for it?
Sure, there is.
  You kidding?
  There is no --
  We want to be sold --
and walk down
  the helmet aisle,
there's no
  helmet accessory.
Okay.
  Also, a bike shop.
O'Leary: There's
  tons of competition.
  But we want to be in every
  mass-market retailer.
We're talking about Toys "R" Us,
  Walmart, Target --
  It's -- Yeah.
Why -- Why are your sales
  so low?
$50,000, and you've got
  how many stores?
In -- Low? I don't agree.
In one year in over 80 specialty
  retailer stores, and we --
she's feisty.
  Look at her go.
  O'Leary: Yeah, we're --
  We're selling --
Yeah, but we're selling --
  We're two moms
  from new Jersey.
Yeah, and I get it, but I'm
  struck. The numbers don't lie.
You're selling hundreds of
  dollars of them in each store.
We just started selling
  over a year ago.
I know, but in a year,
  with 80 stores,
you've done $625 per store
  in a year.
They're all
  gonna get delisted.
There's no way on earth
  a retailer's gonna keep that in
with such small velocity.
That's tiny.
  What's happening?
  Well, we envision --
We envision expanding
  this assortment to include
the hottest kids licenses,
  animation characters --
No, but -- but
  you don't have to expand.
Cuban: Yeah, you're
  missing his point. Yeah,
  you're missing his point.
No, no, no. You're not --
  You're not going to expand.
They're not gonna
  take more product.
It's not working.
  It's just not working.
It's only been a year.
  Give them a little break.
  It's a year!
No, no. Go there. Tell me
  your idea about licensing.
  Why?
Because we really see that this
  is -- This is what kids want.
They asked us
  for this product.
They don't want it!
  They're not buying it!
Maybe people
  don't want to buy them.
Well, that -- We haven't
  had that experience.
No, just -- That's
  just not possible.
Look, you're on fire.
  You're burning.
You have to figure out
  what's wrong
and fix it right away
  before you go to zero.
Do you think that if this
  was price point at $9.99,
we would be
  selling more?
I think so.
  Try anything.
  I think so.
  No.
You do? Okay.
  Try anything.
So let's
  make that happen.
I have to get to China.
  I need your contact.
We were still talking, Barbara.
  You're interrupting.
  Excuse me.
I can't get a word in here.
  I'm still talking.
  You're interrupting.
Just pipe down.
  No, I'm not interrupting.
  I want to know one thing.
I'm getting --
  I'm getting a word in.
  Can I finish my --
  Can I finish my statement?
You've got a minute.
  Go ahead.
Have you set it up
  at $9.99 or done --
Or done flash sales to see
  how people respond at $9.99?
We did do
  a few partnerships
with some of
  the hot flash-Sale websites,
and they did sell out
and come back
  and ask us for more.
  There's your answer.
Was that part --
  Go ahead, Barb.
  Excuse me.
Can I speak a moment?
but not when it negates
  fact that's all around you.
You've got to face the reality
  that all the signs are saying,
"It's a problem, it's a problem,
  it's a problem,"
but you're too blind
  to see it.
So --
  So what are you
  gonna do, Barbara?
But I don't --
  I'm out for sure.
We are absolutely --
We are absolutely committed
  to making this.
That's not enough.
  That's -- That's not enough.
That's not good.
  Yeah, but there's --
Everybody who walks
  into the Shark Tank
is fully committed.
That's why they're here.
  Okay.
It takes more than that
  to be successful.
We are two moms trying
  to create this company.
We need somebody
  who can talk to China.
We want expertise in
  global expansion, licensing --
[ laughs ]
  Oh, lordy.
  O'Leary: Why?
They're asking for it.
  We've had --
  You haven't even conquered
  New Jersey.
What are you worried
  about the globe for?
The market
  wants this now.
People are calling me
  all the time, "Can you send --"
why don't they buy it?
  We've had
  international distributors.
They are buying it!
  Well, why doesn't it
  show up in the numbers?
What would you -- What would --
  what would've made you happy?
If we came in here and we said
  we sold $75,000, $100,000?
  Numbers five times this.
What are you
  looking for?
  Cuban:
  No, actually, wait. No.
Here's what would've
  made it happen.
A million dollars?
  Herjavec: No, no.
This is what would've
  made us happy.
If you would've said,
  "We had one store,
and they sold $50,000 worth,"
and you would've said,
  "We just need more money
so we can go to a second store
  and then a third store."
Then we could project numbers.
You're selling us on the dream
  and not discussing the green.
I'm out.
We really feel like this is
  the beginning for us.
I appreciate what you're saying,
  but for us,
we really are just --
Our momentum is just
  really starting now.
I hope so.
I'm out.
Okay.
Daymond,
  let's do this together.
Let's -- You want
  to sell them at $9.99?
Let's do it together.
It's not about the sales
  that we're upset about.
It's the sales
  and amount of the stores.
You have to look at that,
and you have to take
  all this you've learned
and use it
  moving forward.
But at this point,
  I can't help you. I'm out.
Okay,
  thank you.
Herjavec:
  Is there anybody left?
Well, yes, there is.
  Mister --
[ laughs ]
  Oh, Mr. Wonderful,
  I can't wait to hear this.
[ laughter ]
I don't know
  what you're gonna do.
I really don't know,
because you're on the path,
  right now, to zero.
Well, we came here today
  prepared to make a deal,
and we are still --
  This business
  is not working.
There's no numbers
  that make it work.
  It is working.
I just gave you the math,
  and you deny it.
What's the matter
  with you?
Listen -- This is
  the first step of Fohawx!
There will be a Fohawx!
  For every single kid.
There will be a Fohawx!
  With the mavericks.
There will be a Fohawx!
  With a fubu.
You can print
  on this.
There's glitter,
  there's die-cutting.
Okay, I can't
  take it anymore.
  It's endless.
All right,
  you're missing out.
  Okay, thank you.
John: Good luck.
  Good luck, guys.
  Cuban: Good luck, guys.
and I'm just
  really disappointed
that it didn't
  come across
as being as successful
  as it feels to us.
They were determined.
Ferocious,
  I would say.
  Blinded.
The question was, were they
  determined to make money,
or were they determined
  to prove themselves right?
  To be right.
My name is Al "Bubba" Baker,
  and I live in Avon, Ohio,
with my beautiful wife,
  Sabrina,
and I have
  three lovely children.
I played in the NFL
  for 13 years.
I was rookie of the year.
  I was an all-Pro.
That was my job then,
  but barbecue is my passion.
So, how we doing over here?
  Fantastic.
After my NFL career, I opened up
  my own barbecue restaurant,
and that's where
  my revolutionary product
was invented.
It's convenient, it's delicious,
  and it's all-natural.
Here you go. You ready?
  Touchdown!
It's important for us
  to get this investment today,
because we've spent every penny
  on this dream,
and we've almost wiped out
  the profits from my restaurant.
My family's made
  a lot of sacrifices,
particularly my wife, Sabrina,
and I want to be able
  to show her
that at the end of the day,
  it's gonna pay off.
Being in the NFL for 13 years,
things don't always go according
  to your game plan,
and it's the end result --
  Winning -- that matters.
Hi.
I'm al "Bubba" Baker
  from Avon, Ohio,
owner of the de-boned
  baby back rib steaks.
I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange for 15% equity
  in my company,
and this is
  my lovely daughter Brittani.
She's gonna make you sharks
ribs in a microwave
  in two minutes.
Now, I played a little football
  in the NFL for 13 years.
That was my job.
  Barbecue is my passion.
Sadly, I married a woman
  that doesn't like ribs
because they're too messy.
So I vowed to find a way
for my wife
  to be able to enjoy ribs.
But how do you make ribs
  less messy?
You take the bones out.
  [ laughs ]
After 20 years,
  I found the perfect method,
and the de-boned
  baby back rib steaks were born.
We are the only people
  that have removed the bones
from an actual slab of Rib,
  leaving the meat intact
so that everyone can enjoy ribs
  with a knife and fork.
Our de-boned baby back rib steak
is not pieces of meat
  formed in the shape of a rib,
if you know what I mean.
[ laughs ]
  you tell them, Bubba.
Boneless meats are
  the way of the future,
and the future is now.
Make no bones about it, sharks.
  It's time for some ribs.
John: Yeah.
  It's always time
  for ribs.
All right, Bubba. Bless me
  with the Bubba baby back.
[ laughs ]
Cuban:
  Bubba, who'd you play for?
Well, I played for the lions.
I was rookie of the year
  in 1978.
I played for
  the then-St. Louis cardinals,
and then I came back and
  I retired in Cleveland in 1990.
That's a long career, man.
  Great career.
This is
  absolutely delicious.
Yeah,
  it's very good.
This is really,
  really Good.
  Thank you. Thank you.
So, basically -- I just want
  to be really, really clear.
I buy this, I throw it in the
  microwave for two minutes --
and it tastes like this?
You got it.
Mmm.
Often, when we
  go to restaurants,
cowboy rib eye,
  bone-In rib eye --
Some people actually believe
that the bone
  just tastes better.
That's a great point.
We cook the product
  with the bone in it,
and when the product
  is fully cooked,
then we remove the bones,
  then we quick-chill it,
and then it's packed
  right away.
O'Leary:
  Is there anything proprietary
about how
  you're removing the bone,
or are you
  genetically altering cows
So they grow up
  with no ribs?
[ laughter ]
  actually, it's pigs.
  Kevin, it's hogs.
Okay, So, why couldn't I
  just do the same thing?
Well, um...
if you mind,
  I'm not running, guys.
  The process and the product --
don't run from
  the tough questions.
Okay.
I'm not gonna
  run from any questions.
  Literally.
Right here, Kevin,
is the patent
  for the product,
and right here is
  the patent for the process.
Wow.
Could I see
  the process patent?
Here. Take them both
  to them.
So, nobody else Can make
  boneless ribs?
Let me be more specific.
No one else can make
  a fully cooked rib
with either one or more
  bones removed from it.
Wow.
And how do you
  get the bones out?
If I tell you that,
  I got to kill you.
Kill him.
  Cuban: No, you don't.
  You got a patent.
You got a patent
  for it, Bubba.
You can tell him.
  Yeah, tell me.
Baker: Robert, honestly,
  there's the patent,
then there's the know-How,
and what I say to people
  who are gonna go try
and reverse-engineer
  and figure out how to do it,
I say, "Good luck to you,
'cause it took me
  20 years to do it."
O'Leary: I got to
  tell you something.
In the entire history
  of "Shark Tank,"
I've never seen a patent
  on a food product ever before.
Thank you.
  'cause we worked it.
Herjavec:
  Al, what are your sales
and how many locations
  are you in?
Okay, our sales
  are $154,000.
Over what period?
Over a year's period.
We're selling
  in about 48 stores.
You said it took you
  20 years to develop this,
and you've only been
  in business one year.
What happened
  to those other 19 years?
Well, at one point,
  I'll be honest with you.
I, um -- I hate to
  use this word -- I quit.
And the reason
  that this young lady and I
are partners is
  we had an incident
where she was in track,
  and, like most dads,
I was pushing her.
She said, "Hey,
  I don't want to run track."
I said, "You cannot quit."
And she said, "Well, you quit
  on the boneless ribs."
Oh!
  Corcoran: Powerful.
Yeah.
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't still be doing
  what I'm doing.
O'Leary: Okay, guys.
I actually am an investor
in a restaurant chain
  with 450 locations
that sells
  a ton of protein,
and this is their second-largest
  selling item -- Ribs.
Here's the big problem
  with your deal right now.
You're asking for $2 million
  valuation on this thing.
You're not making any money.
The only value here
  is in the patent.
This reminds me of a story
  that's so relevant to you.
I love stories.
The first season
  of "Shark Tank,"
a guy stood
  right where you are.
He had
  a folding-neck guitar.
He wanted to build out
  a guitar company.
The only thing of value
was the patent
  on the folding-Neck technology.
You know where
  we are today?
  Where are you at?
They are licensing
  that technology
on Fender Bender guitars
  all around the world.
He's gonna be rich.
Listen to
  what I'm saying to you.
A patent on a food product --
  That's interesting.
And the only value
  in the patent
is to license it to
  one of the suppliers of protein.
I want to take you
  to one guy...
okay.
...that supplies eight --
You know what?
  Pigs hate this guy.
  [ laughs ]
All around the world,
  pigs are walking around saying,
"Stop the senseless slaughter,"
  because of this one guy.
[ laughs ]
So, my offer is very simple.
  I'll give you the $300,000.
It's contingent on getting
one of the large
  meat processors in america
to license the patent.
But I want 49%.
That's the deal.
Narrator:
  All five sharks are still in.
Kevin has made an offer
  of $300,000,
contingent on a licensing deal
  with a large meat processor.
But he wants
  49% of Al's company.
That's the first time
  Kevin actually has a decent idea
when it comes to
  something like this.
It's the first time
we've heard his stupid idea
  making any sense.
John:
  That idea is so brilliant,
I'll do the exact same deal,
  but I'll only take 30%.
Bam, Kevin!
This greedy savage --
  His deal is horrible.
O'Leary: He's never done
  a deal like this.
If you talk to
  the guy that owns --
  I've licensed plenty.
Al, let me
  clear it up for you.
  Yeah, okay.
I think you're paying
  a very expensive price
for somebody
  to make a phone call for you
that you could do
  on your own.
I'm out.
Barbara?
I would have pitched you
that I should bring you
  to some of the big-box stores,
some of the club channels,
  like B.J.'s, Costco,
but I happen to think
  some of the offers on the table
are better, so I'm out.
  Okay.
Thank you.
  Cuban: I'm kind of
  in the same boat.
I think you need to
  fatten up the hog some
before it's ready to go.
For me, the business would
  have to be a little bit bigger.
That's why you're limited
  kind of to the licensing play.
So, for those reasons,
  I'm out.
Okay.
Herjavec:
  Al, you got two offers.
  Yeah.
Both licensing deals.
Al, is this the path
  that you want to go down?
Talk to the guys
  at Voyage-air and Fender --
All around the world.
I'm the man.
And I want you and I
  to de-bone this pig together.
[ laughs ]
You've got the real deal,
  or you've got the
  discount license guy.
Day 1, you're not
  taking a check,
and he wants to take
  50% of your company.
49%.
I'm worth every cent
  of that 49%.
What are you gonna do?
Um, Kevin, I love the fact
  that you have made us an offer,
but I think I'm gonna
  take Daymond's deal.
  Ah!
You picked
  the better man, my son.
You de-boned the pig
  right in front of me!
Thanks a lot.
  Right deal, al.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
  Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
Congrats, guys.
[ laughs ]
Hey, hey!
He was
  a great salesperson.
He was a great pitcher.
Yes, he is.
  He was
  a great salesperson.
He understood
  the art of pitching.
And he sure knows
  how to cook a rib.
[ laughs ]
  Yay!
Studying
  Daymond's background,
I think he's a guy
  that enjoys making change,
and that's what this is going to
  do to the barbecue industry.
It's gonna change barbecue
  as we know it.
