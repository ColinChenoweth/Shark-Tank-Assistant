I'm Marley Marotta.
You got to be kidding.
  Marotta: 100% fact.
They don't look
  so stupid now.
  No.
No, they don't.
We launched the product
  in 2010 at magic trade show.
Mendeluk:
  Yeah.
  Great margin.
Marotta:
  Uh, yeah. There was --
Yeah, y-Y-You've probably seen
  quite a few of them
out in the market
  right now.
I've seen
  a lot for kids.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
But one of the main
  things, again, I want to
  get to is the reason
why we've sustained,
  kind of, the storm
Mendeluk: I'm actually stoked
  that we didn't go that low
