You've got to wake up
  and smell the bankruptcy, okay?
[ laughter ]
  Narrator: If the sharks
  hear a great idea...
reow!
Narrator:
  ...they're ready to invest...
Oh, wow!
...using their own money.
I want 50%.
Narrator: And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece
  of the action.
And I want you and I
  to de-Bone this pig together.
[ laughs ]
and then what -- what would you
  see for the brand itself?
Money.
Narrator:
  Who are the sharks?
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert
Who grew
  his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand Fubu,
And Mark Cuban -- notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,
tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
My name is
  Alexander Mendeluk.
And we are the co-creators
  of Spirithoods.
We're seeking $450,000
  for a 15% stake in our company.
Our product brings the
  adventurous spirit of the wild
into everyday life
We're
  a lifestyle brand.
And as a brand, we're about
  community, self-Expression,
and just all around
  having a good time.
We have products for adults,
  kids, and sports markets.
It has paws
  for your hands...
Cuban:
  [ laughing ]
  Corcoran:
  Oh, my gosh.
Oh, yeah.
  ...sleeves that can
  be turned into a scarf.
John:
  Oh, my God.
Ooh, nice, thank you.
It can worn up,
  it can be worn down.
And then,
  on the inside,
there's a hidden
  secret zipper pocket.
press play, and you've
  got music in your head.
Wait, wait.
  I'm chopped liver?
[ whistles ]
introducing,
  ladies and gentlemen,
Picture in the stands
  30,000 fans
both domestically
  and internationally, and --
any of
  the major accounts?
We are currently in Zappos,
  Nordstrom's online, in Harrods,
And is this
  a seasonal sales
and then you kind of tail off
  the rest of the year?
Well, the cold --
  The cold-weather months
  are our months.
What were they last year
  and the year before?
The first year, we had
  $1 million that we launched,
and the second year,
  we had $4.5 million in sales.
And then the third year,
  we had $3 million.
Oh. Ooh.
Hmm.
  And we're on track
  to do $3 million again.
O'Leary: What happened?
  What happened?
We had a big explosion,
  a lot of early adapters,
and then after that, we were
  left with a core business,
and refresh this, right?
It was a trend
within the contemporary
  women's fashion market, yes.
But, again,
  we expand --
Many different markets,
  into
but we have a core business
  that was left from that
that followed
  the brand,
because they love
  what we stand for, what we do.
You never finished off
  your profitability.
You did $4.5 million
  your best year.
How much did you make
  that year?
So the year where we made
  $4.5 million,
John: Wow.
  And what about last year
  at $3 million?
and we had
  a $500,000 loss.
John: Mm.
  Whoa.
Corcoran: Wow.
  $500,000
  or $600,000 loss?
Herjavec: Why?
  Sounds like
  you got skinned that year.
[ laughs ]
  Yeah, yeah.
  We got skinned for sure.
We hired
  a lot of people
because we wanted
  to expand
We went --
  We went -- and We went
too big
  for our own britches.
But what we've now done
  is cut our costs,
focused on what we do best,
  which is this,
and, you know,
  you had mentioned that,
okay, it's
  a downward trend.
is because of the brand,
  the brand, the brand.
And I'm saying
  multiple.
Like, that's how fanatic
  our -- our tribe is.
I've never seen a product
  that elicits a response
  like this.
and girls come up to you
  and start petting you.
And what do you want to use
  the $450,000 for?
We could stay
  right now
with a viable
  $3-million business,
pay off Our debt
  next year,
and then you're gonna
  build it up in a new Category.
Look, I'm not gonna take
  the ride with you. I'm out.
Good business, guys.
And here's
  what happened to us.
Two years,
  we were on fire...
and then the sales
  went completely away.
  Mm-hmm.
...and then
  starting something else.
Mm-hmm.
I'm out.
Thank you.
  You look good in it.
[ Laughter ]
  can I keep it?
Absolutely.
Corcoran: I think
  the best use of it,
you mentioned earlier,
  is as a chick magnet.
I'm gonna go over to you and
  think you're an adorable guy.
[ purrs ]
  I'm not sure
  I'm gonna want to date you...
wow.
  ...but it's
  a great chick magnet.
and that's one of the reasons
  why we're here.
Guys, you've got
  a nice little business, right?
and you'll see
  some folks walking around.
And I-I don't think
  you can get the price point
where I can help you
  in sports,
and I just don't see it,
  so I'm out.
And you're left with the only
  shark that matters in this case.
[ laughter ]
  Daymond is still here.
Thank you for the pressure,
  Rob. How --
  Herjavec: Bang.
And he loves
  this kind of stuff.
  How colorful.
Daymond, the fashion guy
  who started with hats.
Did he
  say that?
  I know!
  I know!
John: I did.
  Oh, we know that.
We've done
  our research.
  Yeah, yeah.
You know, and I would like
  to draw a comparison,
because you know what it's like
  to have an idea
and see something
  in the market
and pound the streets,
  put it on your friends.
You know, we did
  the same type of thing.
We got celebrity exposure.
  The brand grew.
We've been on Bruno Mars,
  Snoop Dogg, ke$ha, Kardashians,
Justin Bieber --
  The list goes on.
Here's the --
  the bigger problem.
This brand
  and this -- this category
are hot for a second,
  is down-Trending.
I would have to take
  a gamble with you,
and it would be --
  it would be --
Let's take a risk.
  Let's do it together.
Well, I don't know if you'll
  want to take the risk with me,
because my risk
  is gonna be $450,000,
and we're gonna license
  this thing out, and I want 50%.
50%.
Ba-bam.
Whoo-Wee!
Narrator:
  Four sharks are out.
Marley and Alexander
  have an offer from Daymond,
but it's an aggressive one.
I would have to take
  a gamble with you,
and it would be --
  it would be --
Let's take a risk.
  Let's do it together.
Well, I don't know if you'll
  want to take the risk with me,
because my risk
  is gonna be $450,000,
and we're gonna license
  this thing out, and I want 50%.
50%.
Ba-Bam.
Whoo-Wee!
and the pricing
  will have to come down.
I want outerwear, backpacks,
and we want to try to find
  licenses for that
and get that out there
  to support the brand.
You see, when I first started
  making hats,
into outerwear and t-Shirts
  and Denim and everything else,
because the hats
  were in and out --
  they were gone.
Yeah.
And then what -- what would you
  see for the brand itself?
Money.
[ laughter ]
Guys, you've got a really nice
  warm and fuzzy offer here.
That's not
  a warm and fuzzy offer.
Yes, it is.
  $450,000 cash.
  You know
  what it's missing?
Barbara,
  shut your pie hole.
You know what it's --
  Barbara's not in this!
  Barbara is not in this.
You know what it's missing?
  It's missing any promise,
any conciseness of how much
  he expects to make for you.
He hasn't given you
  a single number.
He risked $450,000!
  And yet he wants --
if he's so good
  at what he's doing,
he should be able
  to give you
Can we have a moment to go back
  and talk for a little bit?
  Two seconds?
You know what happens when you
  go back and talk, right?
What happens?
don't worry about it.
  Leave the ladies here,
  and go ahead out.
[ Laughter ]
  Thank you.
  Appreciate it.
So, $435,000.
And he's gonna license it out
  into everything else,
and then who knows
what's gonna happen
  to the brand name?
Do we want him
  to just take our brand
and license it out
  to all these different people?
So, Marley and Alex,
  your sales went down.
You scared most sharks away
  except for Daymond,
who knows
  your industry...
except he wants, for $450,000,
50% of your business.
What are you going to do?
and I already have
  buyer's remorse,
and I didn't even buy it.
and that we still have
  our company to show for it.
Absolutely. 100%.
  So, good work, dude.
Man: Joining me is billionaire
  entrepreneur Mr. Mark Cuban.
[ cheers and applause ]
  Let's give it up
  for Daymond John.
Cuban: We're at
  the kingonomics conference
in celebration
  of entrepreneurship
and the 50th anniversary
of the Martin Luther King
  March on D.C.,
and it's a unique opportunity
  for Daymond and I
to help minority entrepreneurs
  understand the American dream
and get fired up
  about starting companies,
running companies,
  and hopefully making some money.
access to capital
  and information
on how to build
  a successful business.
and now I can help others.
[ cheers and Applause ]
  Daymond,
  thank you.
Woman: welcome to
  "Shark Tank" Casting.
Thanks for having us here.
you have everything you need
  right in your hand.
Cuban:
  You know, on "Shark Tank,"
and if we can give someone
  the confidence
to have their dreams come True,
  then it's a good day,
and we've accomplished
  something to be proud of.
John:
  Entrepreneurship resonates with
  minorities for many reasons,
but the good thing is there's
  no color when making money.
And everybody can be a part
  of the American dream.
Narrator: Next into the tank
  is a high-tech way
Our company is Virtuix,
  and we are seeking
$2 million in exchange
  for 10% of our company.
This is the Omni --
so you can use
  the Omni hands-free
so you can hold a controller
  or a gun in your hands.
The Omni can be played
  with Any existing game
and crouch
  in 360 degrees,
and put your mind and your body
  into the video game
to transport you
  into a different world.
[ gunfire, explosions ]
Cuban: Cool.
  John: Wow.
And there's a --
  Oh, very cool.
[ gunshots ]
  Oh, wow!
Oh, Gee!
  Cuban:
  Run, gerbil, run.
Look,
  he's back in Croatia!
[ Laughter ]
  Kevin, come out and play.
  Kevin!
[ Laughter ]
I think once you got used to it,
  you'd be fine.
John: Do you think that guys
  who play games like this
want to exercise?
Now we can play games
  and lose weight and Burn
  calories at the same time.
to put on a headset
  and be in an immersive world.
Is that included
  in the price?
It's not included
  in the price.
  Herjavec: Oh, it's not?
Corcoran: So what do you pay
  for that headset?
I can still sit around
  and lounge.
You're forcing me to stand,
and you're forcing me
  to be interactive.
I don't think people
  want to be that interactive.
I sold 3,000 units
  just without a product yet.
If my husband
  brought this into my house,
I would divorce him immediately.
[ laughs ]
  I think it's a problem
  because of its size in the home.
and they're gonna have to deal
  with their wife on this one.
So I'm out.
John:
  You know, I see the market.
You know,
  "Black Ops" Did amazing.
"Grand Theft Auto," right?
  Breaking records.
So for all those reasons
  and more, I'm out.
Look, great product.
  I will definitely buy one.
and immerse themselves in
  a physical world to that degree.
and it's very expensive.
I look at it and say to myself,
and the answer is
  No, it's not.
There's too much risk
between your delivery
  of a consumer product,
a retail-Distribution strategy,
  and your sales.
And I got to pay
  Tomorrow's price today.
and I have to pay
  for that now?
No. It's an outrage.
  Ridiculous. I'm out.
I get what you're doing.
And in six years,
  there's gonna be
and what can people learn
  from what happened here today?
And, for me,
  the lesson is,
very interesting I.P. --
  way overpriced.
Hi, sharks.
  My name is Jocelyn Fine.
And I'm
  Kelly Dineen.
We're
  from New Jersey,
and we are the founders
  and moms behind Fohawx!
We're here today
  seeking $150,000
in exchange
  for 30% of our business.
and we've made it
  extraordinary.
of outrageous colors
  and styles.
Each and every Fohawx!
Comes with its own
  self-adhesive velcro strip
so it can easily be...
removed and...
  reattached.
Will it work
  on Kevin's head?
[ laughter ]
so you can remove it
and reattach it
  to any safety helmet.
The Fohawx! Brand
  will continue
to design and develop
  products
Jocelyn, can we see one?
Cuban:
  Yeah, could we -- can we?
  Of course.
  Absolutely.
Well, here's
  some samples.
Corcoran:
  So what is the age group
  that you're targeting here?
We are targeting...
  thank you.
...children between
  the ages of 4 and 10.
This --
  This whole concept,
like I said before,
  was inspired by my daughter.
We were doing
  a family bike ride,
and my son,
  who was 7 at the time,
refused to wear
  his bike helmet.
And my daughter,
  she ran to the garage,
got some glue gun
  and some purple tissue paper,
and created a mohawk
right down the center
  of his helmet,
and his whole
  attitude changed.
He loved it.
  He thought he looked so cool.
And I loved it because
  he was wearing his helmet --
  No complaining.
Jocelyn, there --
  There's a lot of products
like this out there.
We can --
  what do you make it for,
  and what do you sell it for?
We make it for $5.
  That's packaged and landed.
A good
  price.
  Oh.
Yes, and our msrp
  is $19.99.
And how many have you sold?
  Where have you sold them?
Since we started selling,
  which was just over a year ago,
and generated
  $50,000 in sales.
  How?
in the world --
  Toys "R" Us and Walmart.
Not in retail --
  Online.
Not in retail, but as some
  of you probably know,
the mass-Market retailers
like to test your products
  a little bit beforehand.
  Right.
Online.
  John:
  They're gonna want --
they're gonna want this thing
  at $9.99, aren't they?
Well, you know,
  we have had no pushback
from any of the buyers.
Wait a sec.
  There's tons of competition.
  Kelly, there's
  tons of competition.
I disagree.
If you go into
  any mass-Market retailer
and walk down
  the helmet aisle,
there's no
  helmet accessory.
But, Kelly, if I walk
  into a ski shop on a ski hill,
there's an entire rack
  of stuff like this.
$50,000, and you've got
  how many stores?
In -- Low? I don't agree.
In one year in over 80 specialty
  retailer stores, and we --
she's feisty.
  Look at her go.
  O'Leary: Yeah, we're --
  We're selling --
Yeah, but we're selling --
  We're two moms
  from new Jersey.
Yeah, and I get it, but I'm
  struck. The numbers don't lie.
You're selling hundreds of
  dollars of them in each store.
We just started selling
  over a year ago.
I know, but in a year,
  with 80 stores,
you've done $625 per store
  in a year.
We envision expanding
  this assortment to include
the hottest kids licenses,
  animation characters --
No, but -- but
  you don't have to expand.
Cuban: Yeah, you're
  missing his point. Yeah,
  you're missing his point.
No, no, no. You're not --
  You're not going to expand.
They're not gonna
  take more product.
It's not working.
  It's just not working.
It's only been a year.
  Give them a little break.
  It's a year!
Fine: Another thing We really
  need to talk about is licensing.
We think that --
  what? Don't even go there.
You've sold
  $50,000 worth of this stuff.
  Corcoran: Yeah.
and fix it right away
  before you go to zero.
Do you think that if this
  was price point at $9.99,
we would be
  selling more?
I think so.
  Try anything.
  I think so.
  No.
You do? Okay.
  Try anything.
So let's
  make that happen.
I have to get to China.
  I need your contact.
Corcoran: Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.
  The only way --
O'Leary: No, no, no, no.
  Can I get a word in here?
Have you ever set a price
  at $9.99?
  Excuse me. Excuse me.
Let's stay on the numbers.
  Excuse me.
  Barbara!
and they did sell out
and come back
  and ask us for more.
  There's your answer.
Was that part --
  Go ahead, Barb.
  Excuse me.
Can I speak a moment?
Yes.
  Fine: Yes, please.
Consider the possibility
that you're blinded
by your sheer love
  of Making this thing go,
which is a wonderful trait,
I hate this product.
  It doesn't sell.
  Fine: It's too soon.
  It's too soon.
Then don't say --
  Oh, my gosh.
If we came in here and we said
  we sold $75,000, $100,000?
  Numbers five times this.
and they sold $50,000 worth,"
and you would've said,
  "We just need more money
so we can go to a second store
  and then a third store."
Then we could project numbers.
You're selling us on the dream
  and not discussing the green.
I'm out.
Kelly, Um, look, you're --
  You're very scattered.
There's a lot of products
  like it.
You don't want to acknowledge
  that, but there are.
And you're not getting
  enough customers.
It's the sales
  and amount of the stores.
You have to look at that,
and you have to take
  all this you've learned
and use it
  moving forward.
But at this point,
  I can't help you. I'm out.
Okay,
  thank you.
and we are still --
  This business
  is not working.
There's no numbers
  that make it work.
  It is working.
I just gave you the math,
  and you deny it.
What's the matter
  with you?
Listen -- This is
  the first step of Fohawx!
There will be a Fohawx!
  For every single kid.
There will be a Fohawx!
  With the mavericks.
There will be a Fohawx!
  With a fubu.
You can print
  on this.
There's glitter,
  there's die-cutting.
Okay, I can't
  take it anymore.
  It's endless.
Corcoran: Kelly --
  I want partners
  that can deal in reality.
You've got to wake up
  and smell the bankruptcy, okay?
I'm out.
Fine: Okay.
  Thank you.
  Prove us wrong.
[ sighs ]
  Corcoran: Ugh.
Exhausting.
I truly feel like Fohawx!
  Is my fourth child.
I have sacrificed
  so much to get here,
and I'm just
  really disappointed
that it didn't
  come across
as being as successful
  as it feels to us.
They were determined.
Ferocious,
  I would say.
  Blinded.
The question was, were they
  determined to make money,
or were they determined
  to prove themselves right?
  To be right.
My name is Al "Bubba" Baker,
  and I live in Avon, Ohio,
with my beautiful wife,
  Sabrina,
and I have
  three lovely children.
I played in the NFL
  for 13 years.
and that's where
  my revolutionary product
was invented.
It's convenient, it's delicious,
  and it's all-natural.
Here you go. You ready?
  Touchdown!
It's important for us
  to get this investment today,
because we've spent every penny
  on this dream,
and we've almost wiped out
  the profits from my restaurant.
My family's made
  a lot of sacrifices,
particularly my wife, Sabrina,
and I want to be able
  to show her
that at the end of the day,
  it's gonna pay off.
Being in the NFL for 13 years,
and it's the end result --
  Winning -- that matters.
Hi.
and this is
  my lovely daughter Brittani.
She's gonna make you sharks
ribs in a microwave
  in two minutes.
and the de-boned
  baby back rib steaks were born.
so that everyone can enjoy ribs
  with a knife and fork.
and the future is now.
and then I came back and
  I retired in Cleveland in 1990.
That's a long career, man.
  Great career.
This is
  absolutely delicious.
Yeah,
  it's very good.
and it tastes like this?
You got it.
Mmm.
Often, when we
  go to restaurants,
and when the product
  is fully cooked,
and then it's packed
  right away.
O'Leary:
  Is there anything proprietary
if you mind,
  I'm not running, guys.
  The process and the product --
don't run from
  the tough questions.
Okay.
and right here is
  the patent for the process.
Wow.
Could I see
  the process patent?
And how do you
  get the bones out?
If I tell you that,
  I got to kill you.
Kill him.
  Cuban: No, you don't.
  You got a patent.
and what I say to people
  who are gonna go try
and reverse-engineer
  and figure out how to do it,
I say, "Good luck to you,
'cause it took me
  20 years to do it."
O'Leary: I got to
  tell you something.
In the entire history
  of "Shark Tank,"
I've never seen a patent
  on a food product ever before.
Thank you.
  'cause we worked it.
and how many locations
  are you in?
and you've only been
  in business one year.
What happened
  to those other 19 years?
Well, at one point,
  I'll be honest with you.
I, um -- I hate to
  use this word -- I quit.
And the reason
  that this young lady and I
are partners is
  we had an incident
where she was in track,
  and, like most dads,
I was pushing her.
She said, "Hey,
  I don't want to run track."
I said, "You cannot quit."
And she said, "Well, you quit
  on the boneless ribs."
Oh!
  Corcoran: Powerful.
Yeah.
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't still be doing
  what I'm doing.
O'Leary: Okay, guys.
and this is their second-largest
  selling item -- Ribs.
And the only value
  in the patent
is to license it to
  one of the suppliers of protein.
I want to take you
  to one guy...
okay.
...that supplies eight --
You know what?
  Pigs hate this guy.
  [ laughs ]
Talk to the guys
  at Voyage-air and Fender --
And I want you and I
  to de-bone this pig together.
[ laughs ]
and he wants to take
  50% of your company.
49%.
I'm worth every cent
  of that 49%.
What are you gonna do?
Um, Kevin, I love the fact
  that you have made us an offer,
And he sure knows
  how to cook a rib.
[ laughs ]
  Yay!
Studying
  Daymond's background,
I think he's a guy
  that enjoys making change,
and that's what this is going to
  do to the barbecue industry.
It's gonna change barbecue
  as we know it.
