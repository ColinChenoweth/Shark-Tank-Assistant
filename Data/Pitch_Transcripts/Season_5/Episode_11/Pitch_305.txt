My name is
  Alexander Mendeluk.
I'm Marley Marotta.
And we are the co-creators
  of Spirithoods.
We're seeking $450,000
  for a 15% stake in our company.
Our product brings the
  adventurous spirit of the wild
into everyday life
You got to be kidding.
  Marotta: 100% fact.
They don't look
  so stupid now.
  No.
No, they don't.
We launched the product
  in 2010 at magic trade show.
Mendeluk:
  Yeah.
  Great margin.
Marotta:
  Uh, yeah. There was --
Yeah, y-Y-You've probably seen
  quite a few of them
out in the market
  right now.
I've seen
  a lot for kids.
  Yeah.
  Yeah.
But one of the main
  things, again, I want to
  get to is the reason
why we've sustained,
  kind of, the storm
is because of the brand,
  the brand, the brand.
Marley and Alexander
  have an offer from Daymond,
but it's an aggressive one.
I would have to take
  a gamble with you,
and it would be --
  it would be --
Let's take a risk.
  Let's do it together.
Well, I don't know if you'll
  want to take the risk with me,
because my risk
  is gonna be $450,000,
and we're gonna license
  this thing out, and I want 50%.
50%.
Ba-Bam.
Whoo-Wee!
So, Marley and Alex,
  your sales went down.
You scared most sharks away
  except for Daymond,
who knows
  your industry...
except he wants, for $450,000,
50% of your business.
What are you going to do?
Mendeluk: I'm actually stoked
  that we didn't go that low
and that we still have
  our company to show for it.
Absolutely. 100%.
  So, good work, dude.
Man: Joining me is billionaire
  entrepreneur Mr. Mark Cuban.
[ cheers and applause ]
  Let's give it up
  for Daymond John.
Cuban: We're at
  the kingonomics conference
in celebration
  of entrepreneurship
and the 50th anniversary
of the Martin Luther King
  March on D.C.,
and it's a unique opportunity
  for Daymond and I
to help minority entrepreneurs
  understand the American dream
