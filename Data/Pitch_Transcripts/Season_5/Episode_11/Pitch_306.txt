I think once you got used to it,
  you'd be fine.
John: Do you think that guys
  who play games like this
want to exercise?
Hi, sharks.
  My name is Jocelyn Fine.
And I'm
  Kelly Dineen.
We're
  from New Jersey,
and we are the founders
  and moms behind Fohawx!
We're here today
  seeking $150,000
in exchange
  for 30% of our business.
Jocelyn, can we see one?
Cuban:
  Yeah, could we -- can we?
  Of course.
  Absolutely.
Well, here's
  some samples.
Corcoran:
  So what is the age group
  that you're targeting here?
We are targeting...
  thank you.
...children between
  the ages of 4 and 10.
This --
  This whole concept,
like I said before,
  was inspired by my daughter.
We were doing
  a family bike ride,
and my son,
  who was 7 at the time,
refused to wear
  his bike helmet.
And my daughter,
  she ran to the garage,
got some glue gun
  and some purple tissue paper,
and created a mohawk
right down the center
  of his helmet,
and his whole
  attitude changed.
He loved it.
  He thought he looked so cool.
And I loved it because
  he was wearing his helmet --
  No complaining.
Jocelyn, there --
  There's a lot of products
like this out there.
Wait a sec.
  There's tons of competition.
  Kelly, there's
  tons of competition.
I disagree.
If you go into
  any mass-Market retailer
But, Kelly, if I walk
  into a ski shop on a ski hill,
there's an entire rack
  of stuff like this.
Fine: Another thing We really
  need to talk about is licensing.
We think that --
  what? Don't even go there.
You've sold
  $50,000 worth of this stuff.
  Corcoran: Yeah.
Corcoran: Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.
  The only way --
O'Leary: No, no, no, no.
  Can I get a word in here?
Have you ever set a price
  at $9.99?
  Excuse me. Excuse me.
Let's stay on the numbers.
  Excuse me.
  Barbara!
Yes.
  Fine: Yes, please.
Consider the possibility
that you're blinded
by your sheer love
  of Making this thing go,
which is a wonderful trait,
I hate this product.
  It doesn't sell.
  Fine: It's too soon.
  It's too soon.
Then don't say --
  Oh, my gosh.
Kelly, Um, look, you're --
  You're very scattered.
There's a lot of products
  like it.
You don't want to acknowledge
  that, but there are.
And you're not getting
  enough customers.
Corcoran: Kelly --
  I want partners
  that can deal in reality.
You've got to wake up
  and smell the bankruptcy, okay?
I'm out.
Fine: Okay.
  Thank you.
  Prove us wrong.
[ sighs ]
  Corcoran: Ugh.
Exhausting.
I truly feel like Fohawx!
  Is my fourth child.
I have sacrificed
  so much to get here,
