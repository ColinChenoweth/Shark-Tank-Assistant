Hello, sharks.
  My name is Jan Goetelvk.
I am from Houston, texas.
Our company is Virtuix,
  and we are seeking
$2 million in exchange
  for 10% of our company.
This is the Omni --
Goetelvk: This is
  the Oculus Rift.
Okay, so you're
  using Oculus Rift, right.
Oculus Rift --
  You can interface
with the different types
  of video platforms.
  That's right.
Whoa!
  [ Laughter ]
Goetelvk: Be careful, Buddy.
  Be careful when you get in.
You better give Robert
  a vomit bag.
[ laughter ]
Goetelvk:
  We're selling those on our
  website right now for $499.
That's it?
  Mm-hmm.
That's cheaper
  than I would've thought.
How many
  have you sold?
So, we launched this product
  on kickstarter in June.
What did you raise?
We raised $1.1 million.
  Wow.
How many units
  are you gonna have to deliver?
  Close to 3,000.
Thank you very much, Jan.
  That was awesome.
  Great.
It was very cool.
  Very, very cool.
Wait till you see
  how uncool you looked up there.
John: Were you winded
  when you were on there?
Herjavec:
  I was, but I don't know
if I was winded because I didn't
  know how to use it.
Goetelvk: Mm-hmm.
  'cause, I mean,
  no one's addressed that.
Herjavec:
  Yeah, I want to hear that.
I think it's
  the elephant in the room.
  Mm-hmm.
O'Leary: Jan, staying
  on the numbers for a minute,
we can debate the merits
  of the product.
I'm just trying to look
  at the sheer number.
Goetelvk: Thank you.
  Thanks, guys.
O'Leary: Jan, you know,
  I look at the experience,
and what can people learn
  from what happened here today?
And, for me,
  the lesson is,
very interesting I.P. --
  way overpriced.
Thank you.
  Herjavec:
  Good luck, Jan.
