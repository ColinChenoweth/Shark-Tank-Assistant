Hi, sharks.
  I'm Evan Mendelsohn.
And I'm Nick Morton.
Our company is Tipsy Elves,
  and our slogan is
"Not your mama's
  Christmas sweater."
We are seeking
  a $100,000 investment
for 5% of our company.
Before Tipsy Elves,
  Christmas sweaters were old,
they smelled terrible,
and you could only find them
  at your local Thrift store.
Tipsy Elves re-creates
those Christmas sweaters
  of the past
with fun, witty, high-Quality
  Christmas sweaters
that the whole family
  can enjoy.
And they fit great,
  too.
But don't take it from us,
  sharks.
See for yourselves.
Both: welcome to
  the Tipsy Elves fashion show.
John: [ laughs ]
O'Leary: [ sighs ]
first we have Greg.
Greg is wearing
  our runaway sleigh sweater,
where Santa's sleigh
  gets the best of him.
He's also wearing our popular
  Christmas bomber Hat.
Next up, we have adry.
She's wearing
  our elf sweater.
She's also wearing
  our believe Fanny Pack.
Next, we have Brad.
Brad is wearing our popular
  Hanukkah Sweater.
Next up, we have Nikki.
Nikki is wearing our
  bucktooth Rudolph sweater dress.
Oh, that's cute.
  Greiner: Yeah.
Morton: She's also wearing
  our reindeer animal hat.
Mendelsohn: Last but certainly
  not least, we have Andrew.
Andrew is wearing our
  reindeer matchmaker jump suit,
which is brand-New
  this season.
Zip it up
  and watch them kiss.
All right, sharks,
  so you've seen
a little bit
  of what we have to offer.
Our beautiful models here
are gonna be
  handing out a sweater
to each one of you
  that we've picked out
along
  with Our bomber hat.
Herjavec: Thank you.
Thank you.
Morton: The idea behind it
  was that there were
a bunch of Tipsy Elves
  up in Santa's --
You know,
  making these sweaters.
You guys look great.
Now it's time
  to get down to business.
This stuff is hideous.
Why don't you give us
  some sales numbers?
Mendelsohn:
  We started in 2011.
2012,
  our sales were $862,000.
Which gave us $1.35 million
  in Sales in those 2 years.
Wow.
  A little more than half
  of our orders came from amazon.
This year, we started
  dabbling in wholesale.
For example, one major retailer,
  urban outfitters,
placed an order with us.
I own the ugliest sweater
  company in history, coogi,
the ones that bill Cosby
  used to wear.
Yeah.
  And they're ugly.
Ugly!
  No, trust me.
  They're really ugly.
Um, and the challenge we have
  is the returns.
So how much does
  each one cost to make?
$12 --
  $11.40 per sweater.
And what do you
  sell them for?
  And what do you
  sell them for?
Sell them for $65.
Oh!
  Wow.
Wow.
Greiner:
  What made you say one day,
"I'm gonna make
  ugly Christmas sweaters"?
MORTON:
  Evan was a lawyer,
and it wasn't a job
  that he wanted to pursue.
I had a background
  in s.E.O.,
So I started doing
  internet businesses,
like mostly
  informational websites
where I'd make money
  off ad revenue.
I saw there was a high demand
  for Christmas sweaters
based on search volume.
Why get into the wholesale
  retail side of it?
Doesn't that
  just complicate things
and increase
  your overhead?
Once you take
  a wholesale account,
you've got
  to support them,
you've got to interact
  with them,
you've got to make
  their buyers happy,
you've got to talk
  about next season.
At our core,
  we're an e-Commerce site.
Why risk it and go into a
  new area where you're uncertain
and you've got guys
  like Daymond
who know this stuff inside
  and out competing with you?
John: To mark's point,
  when you come over to our side,
you're gonna have to be able
  to take back inventory,
you're gonna have to have
  a warehouse the size of,
you know, two blocks.
It's gonna be a lot.
  Sure.
O'Leary: Everybody's
  echoing the same thing.
You shouldn't take this
  to retail, in my opinion.
We're pursuing
  the online strategy
as -- As much as we can.
Retail is the drug
  that everybody goes for.
They look at that order,
  and they say, "Wow,
  I got to fill that."
We have retailers
  coming to us,
and it's just hard for us
  to turn it -- to turn it down.
Look, it sounds like
  what you guys are good at
is s.E.O.
  And selling online.
But I'm getting the sense
that you think that there's
  a ceiling there.
Yeah. We're -- We're pretty
  maxed out on s.E.O.
2011, we were number one
  on "Ugly Christmas sweater,"
"Ugly Christmas Sweaters."
HERJAVEC: Do you guys do
  this full time?
I quit last year
  to focus on this full time.
And I was getting paid about
  $170,000 a year plus bonus,
so it was a bit
  of a wake up --
  Wow.
You wake up one night.
You got a $170,000 job, you say,
  "Ugly Christmas Sweaters!"
I mean,
  I'm -- I'm a risk-Adverse guy.
It's a testament to --
  to me believing in this.
Like, I-I really
  wouldn't walk away
from a $170,000 job
  on a -- on a whim.
Okay, but we know
  the sweaters are ugly,
but also the valuation
  is ugly.
Why don't you try and defend
  why this is worth $2 million?
The reason our valuation
  is at that point
is last year, we -- You know,
  we had $862,000 in sales.
It would have --
  if we would have not run out,
we would have had
  a little over a million.
Well, I'm looking at it, saying
  you have to give a discount
for the fact there's risk in
  the seasonality in the return.
Yeah, you know what? Don't ever
  listen to Kevin on that stuff.
He's the worst
  at valuations.
  I'm very good
  at it, actually.
I mean, you guys have --
  your -- your problem
is not valuation,
  all right.
If you're going to grow --
  Really?
Yeah, because some of us know
  how to grow past the valuation.
Some people look backwards.
  Some of us look forward.
  So, Mark, why don't you give
  them a $4 million valuation?
But doesn't matter.
  The valuation isn't the issue.
  Well, that's --
  It doesn't matter.
It's where you can go.
But the problem I have is that
  you really haven't explained
how you're going to grow.
I know you guys hate
  when it sounds like people
are, you know, getting away
  from their core competency.
It -- it probably sounds
  like that.
But it's -- It's really
  easily duplicating
what's worked here,
  and from our point of view,
we're maxing out everything
  we can possibly think of
when it comes
  to the E-Commerce side.
  And that's the problem.
Trying to do everything
  is what scares me significantly.
And so even though I think
  you've got a good business,
a growing business,
  I'm out.
Greiner: I think you're
  on a really good start,
but there's other companies
  that do this.
There's nothing unique.
I'm out.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Here's how it works.
I'm gonna give you
  the $100,000.
I want $2 a sweater
  till I recapture my 100K,
then it drops to $1 a sweater
  in perpetuity.
What equity
  are you taking?
  Zero. Zero equity.
And would you be involved
  in the business,
or would you
  mostly just be treating it
kind of like
  as a source of capital?
I-I work with All
  my entrepreneurs,
and I do everything I can
  to optimize
'cause our incentives
  are aligned.
I'm about money.
John:
  So I'm actually shocked.
Scrooge has made you guys
  an offer.
Do you like his offer?
I'd love to hear if --
  if there's any other
  offers on the table,
but we're definitely
  interested.
Herjavec: So, it's an
  interesting offer from Kevin.
It's actually not
  that bad an offer.
It's bad,
  but not that bad.
I love the fact
  that you left
a $175,000-a-year job
  to do this,
because that tells me
  you're all in, my friend,
and I love that level
  of commitment to it.
There's no going back
  for you.
No.
I don't have a problem
  with the retail.
You know, I think
  when you start out,
you try everything.
So here's my offer
  to you.
$100,000 for 10%.
Daymond's being very quiet.
  So we'd also like to --
  Yeah.
Yes, he is.
  What are you doing?
Robert -- $100,000,
  10% of the company.
Kevin -- $2 Per sweater
  until you get your money back,
  I'm not greedy.
  I don't need a --
till you get $100,000 back,
  and then $1 in Perpetuity.
Yes, that's correct,
  Daymond.
And you're
  going to do what?
You're the clothing man.
Yeah, um...
Oh, this is hard.
Narrator:
  Two sharks are out.
Nick and Evan have two offers
  on the table
from Robert and Kevin,
but the clothing expert,
  Daymond, is on the fence.
Oh, this is hard.
I'm really --
  I'm falling in love
with the product
  and the guys.
I just -- I still have inventory
  of ugly sweaters.
Exactly.
  That's the challenge.
And you'll be selling those
  to me.
  [ laughs ]
My challenge is exactly
  what mark has been saying.
This is very seasonal.
  You guys are doing great.
You guys are doing
  what I cannot do online, s.E.O.
You're gonna go
  to these big guys,
and after they're
  through with you guys,
they just let it go.
  Mendelsohn: And it's not --
We're not relying on
  their business. It's --
  It's just adding --
right, but if you're not relying
  on their business,
then I can't be of service
  to you.
You guys can go to $5 million
  and $10 million without anybody.
And --
  but you can help add
  to what we're doing
on the online side with your
  distribution channels and...
I can't.
  I can't add to that.
You guys
  are already doing that.
That's what
  mark is saying.
  He's a retail king.
So if you're going
  the retail strategy --
  I'm the retail king.
I can make --
  I can make goods for you,
but you're making the goods
  at the same price, so...
...I'm out.
O'Leary: So you have two offers
  on the table.
You basically have one from me
that doesn't take any
  of your equity away.
I give you $100,000.
You pay me $2 a sweater
  until I get my capital back
and then $1 in perpetuity.
Or you have
  an offer from Robert,
which was $100,000
  for 10% equity.
Evan, I'm just really
  investing in you guys.
I think that you can
  build this up.
I think the college market
  is gonna go huge for you guys.
I want to participate
  in the company.
Kevin just wants to suck money
  right off the top.
You know,
  in the spirit of Christmas,
I'm not stealing
  your equity like Robert is.
There's a lump of coal
  over there.
[ indistinct whispering ]
Mr. Wonderful...
...we appreciate your offer,
but, Robert,
  we accept your offer.
Excellent, guys.
  Thank you.
  O'Leary: Oh!
Excellent. Yeah.
  Greiner: Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
  Good job, guys.
  Good job.
Thank you.
  Very, very impressive.
Congratulations, guys.
  John:
  Congratulations.
Wow. Great job.
  Great job, guys.
Morton: Whoo!
MENDELSOHN: That was good.
  That's good.
Yeah,
  that was awesome.
Kevin, how many versions
  of a royalty deal
can you possibly do?
That's why I love me.
[ chuckles ]
whoo!
  MENDELSOHN: Yes!
Tipsy Elves!
A deal with Robert was really
  a-a Christmas wish for us.
Yeah, our Christmas dreams
  definitely came True today.
All: Tipsy Elves! Whoo!
