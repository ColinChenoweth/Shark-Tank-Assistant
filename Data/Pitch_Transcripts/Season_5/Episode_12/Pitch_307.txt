Hi, sharks.
  I'm Evan Mendelsohn.
Morton: She's also wearing
  our reindeer animal hat.
Morton: The idea behind it
  was that there were
a bunch of Tipsy Elves
  up in Santa's --
You know,
  making these sweaters.
You guys look great.
Now it's time
  to get down to business.
This stuff is hideous.
Why don't you give us
  some sales numbers?
Mendelsohn:
  We started in 2011.
2012,
  our sales were $862,000.
Which gave us $1.35 million
  in Sales in those 2 years.
Wow.
  A little more than half
  of our orders came from amazon.
This year, we started
  dabbling in wholesale.
For example, one major retailer,
  urban outfitters,
placed an order with us.
I own the ugliest sweater
  company in history, coogi,
the ones that bill Cosby
  used to wear.
MORTON:
  Evan was a lawyer,
Evan, I'm just really
  investing in you guys.
I think that you can
  build this up.
I think the college market
  is gonna go huge for you guys.
I want to participate
  in the company.
Kevin just wants to suck money
  right off the top.
You know,
  in the spirit of Christmas,
I'm not stealing
  your equity like Robert is.
There's a lump of coal
  over there.
[ indistinct whispering ]
Mr. Wonderful...
...we appreciate your offer,
but, Robert,
  we accept your offer.
Excellent, guys.
  Thank you.
  O'Leary: Oh!
Excellent. Yeah.
  Greiner: Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
  Good job, guys.
  Good job.
Thank you.
  Very, very impressive.
Congratulations, guys.
  John:
  Congratulations.
Wow. Great job.
  Great job, guys.
Morton: Whoo!
MENDELSOHN: That was good.
  That's good.
Yeah,
  that was awesome.
Kevin, how many versions
  of a royalty deal
can you possibly do?
That's why I love me.
[ chuckles ]
whoo!
  MENDELSOHN: Yes!
Tipsy Elves!
A deal with Robert was really
  a-a Christmas wish for us.
Yeah, our Christmas dreams
  definitely came True today.
All: Tipsy Elves! Whoo!
