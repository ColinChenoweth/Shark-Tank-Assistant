My name is Morri Chowaiki.
I live in San Diego, California,
with my wife and three kids.
1, 2, 3. Oh!
The holiday season
  in Our house is fantastic.
It's full of love, presents,
  tons of good food, and laughter.
Happy Christmas!
  Happy Hanukkah!
Looks great,
  but maybe a little -- No.
Not on your life.
Chowaiki:
  My wife celebrates Christmas.
And I celebrate Hanukkah.
  Children: Yay!
My product is a solution
  for the thousands and thousands
of interfaith families
  that live in the United States,
and it bridges the gap
between "Ho, ho, ho"
  And "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel."
Come on, guys.
  Get our orders out.
I have been selling my product
  now for three years.
I've already put a second
  mortgage out on our house
to make this dream come True.
We can't keep putting money
into this business ourselves.
Without an investment
  from the sharks,
I fear that we just
  won't make it.
Oh!
  Daddy!
This product
  is important to me
because it brought us together
  as a family.
And to be able to provide
  that same gift
to the millions of interfaith
  families that are out there
would just be a wonderful
  achievement in life for me.
[ chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Hello, gefilte sharks.
And how are you?
  [ laughs ]
My name is Morri Chowaiki,
and I'm from san Diego,
  California.
My company is one life products,
and I'm here seeking $50,000
in exchange
  for 15% of my company.
Sharks, chrismukkah...
  [ laughter ]
...is the most wonderful time
  of the year,
a time when Interfaith families
  Can play spin the dreidel
while kissing
  under the mistletoe.
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if interfaith families
  could find a way
to truly capture the spirit
  of chrismukkah?
Well, mazel toe.
Because now they can
  with the Hanukkah tree topper.
It's the perfect pairing between
  all these holiday traditions,
and, hey, doesn't it look great
  on top of a Christmas tree?
No more debates between
  Candy canes or chocolate gelt
or Santa versus Hanukkah Harry.
[ laughs ]
  You get
  the best of both worlds
with the Hanukkah tree topper.
[ laughter ]
  together, I know we can take
  the Hanukkah tree topper
to the next level and make
  lots of shekels doing it.
So what do you say?
This holiday,
  let's reach for the star
and sell like meshuggener!
[ laughter ]
So, I-I want to make sure
  we understand this right.
Is the product simply the star
  to put on top of the tree?
Yes, it is.
  Can we see them,
  morri?
Absolutely.
  Who would like to see them?
Greiner: Here.
  Cuban: We'd all like
  to see them.
O'Leary: We all would.
  All right. Fantastic.
Cuban: Yeah.
  Oh!
Down Goes morri!
  Down I go. Down I go.
There you go.
  And there is --
You can turn on
  the switch on that.
  So -- So one lights up,
  and one doesn't.
One does not.
Oh, there it is.
  Exactly.
How many of these
  have you sold?
I have sold approximately 12,000
  of that item right there.
Of this one.
  Herjavec: Where are you
  selling them, morri?
Currently we are selling
  in a big-Box retail store
as well as online
  and in a-a flight magazine.
What do you
  sell them for?
Sell those for $19.99.
  They cost $2.
So we have
  about a 70% wholesale Margin
and 90% retail margin.
Those are higher end.
We're at about $35.99
  and about, right now, a $9 cost
because it's our first run, and
  we expect costs to come down.
How much have you made
  on your 12,000 units?
  Our gross sales
  have been $150,000.
In the last 12 months.
No.
In the last three seasons.
Whoa.
This year --
Morri, baby,
  that's not a lot of sales.
Oh, well --
  Bubele, come on!
You got to step up
  your game.
  Wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.
  Morri, oy vey!
  Come on!
Let me tell you something.
  Let me tell you something.
We've got massive potential,
  and let me tell you why, okay?
[ laughter ]
  first of all --
I love when the answer
  to existing sales is potential.
Oh, no. This is --
  This is real potential.
Or could it be, morri,
that there's a little
  market confusion going on here?
Nope.
  But, morri,
  sales are poo-Poo.
So, here are the stats.
A national survey was done
that said that nearly 50%
of all jewish people
  in the United States
have married somebody
  of another faith.
So we feel
  that there is a target audience
of probably somewhere
  in the neighborhood
of a million to a million
  and a half households
for this one item.
The retailer that we're in,
we're in about 200 --
  Almost 200 stores.
Herjavec:
  Which retailer is it?
  Bed bath &amp; beyond.
Is that the only retailer
  you're in?
In brick and mortar, yes.
What percent of sales
  are online,
and what are in retail?
I'd say 70% online,
  20% in-Flight magazine,
and the rest with stores.
Morri, what are you gonna
  use the money for?
Number one --
  New product design.
We want to get our own website
  up and running
so that we're not relying
  on Sites and Commissions
and things like that.
I need some fulfillment space,
because we started
  not being able to park
  one car in the garage.
Now it's two cars in the garage,
  and my wife --
You're doing this all
  from home?
  Everything. 100%.
How much money
  have you put in?
About close to $130,000
  of our own money.
Wow.
O'Leary: Morri, one of
  the challenges about this,
it's
  a seasonal business.
I hate seasonality because,
  you know, you have one shot.
You either make
  too much or make too little.
It's always the same problem
  every year.
That's never gonna change
  with --
  Mr. Wonderful, I was waiting
  for you bring that up.
And what's your answer?
My answer is, number one, first
  and foremost, you're right.
It is seasonal.
But number two --
  You're making the deal with me,
and I work
  12 months out of the year.
Morri,
  there's another problem.
When a family buys this,
  it's once.
  Mm-hmm.
They don't need to buy it again.
Subset of a subset
  of a subset market,
seasonal purchase,
  one-time-In-Your-Life only.
If you described hell on earth,
  that would be it.
[ chuckles ]
No, I think --
I'm sorry.
  I have to disagree.
In my heart, I know
  we got something special
and that is -- and it's -- and
  it may be a niche, but it's --
but it's small.
Well, let me tell you what
  small is. Okay. So I've got --
I know what small is --
  your sales.
Thank you. Well...
  Hey, that's -- That's --
Numbers don't lie,
  my friend.
Well, let me explain
  what's coming.
I've been invited into
the largest mass-Market
  big-Box store,
one of the two
  largest drugstore chains,
the largest toy-Store chain,
as well as one of the largest
  discount-Clothing chains.
"Invited" means to show it
  or you have a purchase order?
"Invited" means to show it.
My friend, morri,
  I'm out.
I understand.
You know, I can't believe
  I'm going to say this,
but...
I actually agree
  with Kevin.
And I don't think
  you have a big enough market
for this to become
  something really scalable
and a huge business
  for you.
Mm-hmm.
  And so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Lori,
  I'll be honest with you.
I want
  to do business with you.
And --
  Morri, she's out.
I'm out.
  All right.
Let me tell you this.
You're working
  in a full-Time job,
and you're working
  basically out of your garage.
The biggest challenge
  that I've ever experienced
with all my "Shark Tank"
  Companies
has been getting
  out of the garage
and getting into an office
  or whatever it may be,
and growing out
  of that home-Based business.
  Which is what I want.
I don't expect you
  to run my business.
What I want is your expertise
  behind, you know,
marketing, social search-Engine
  Optimization.
Look, it's what you want,
  but you're not set up
to do that right now,
  so for that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
I think you've done
  a good job here.
But 3 years later,
  you're at $60,000.
But I haven't even broke
  Brick and mortar yet.
For that reason,
  I'm out.
Okay.
Daymond.
You know, I-I did a deal
  with, uh, a rabbi.
Sure you did.
  Rabbi -- Rabbi Moshe.
Moshe. Um...
[ Laughs ]
Soundbender.
  Yeah.
Are you gonna
  make an offer on this?
Uh...
there's no way
  this is going to be
a multi-million-dollar
  business ever.
No.
Narrator:
  Four sharks are out.
Daymond is morri's last chance
  at getting a deal.
Are you gonna
  make an offer on this?
  Uh...
there's no way
  this is going to be
a multi-million-dollar
  business ever.
  No.
I don't want scrooge
to interrupt my, uh,
  thought process here.
[ laughs ]
Yeah, Christmas and Hanukkah
  are about faith, and I --
I just question your judgment.
  That's all.
I like --
  There's product extension.
If he has that,
  he may have some other stuff.
You know what? I-I think I want
  to take a Gamble on you.
Uh, $50,000 for 35%
  is my offer.
35%.
Wow.
Morri, why are you even
  thinking about that?
I'm not looking
  for control.
Okay.
  I'm just looking
  for a happy chrikkahmas.
35%.
Can I ask, is it e-Commerce
  that you can bring?
Is it ret--
  I mean, w-What --
  GREINER: Morri. Morri.
You don't want to have
  an "Oh, no" Moment.
This is
  a licensing play.
  Okay.
And this is to do bulbs
  and Socks and other things,
as well
  as the primary product.
You know, morri,
  do me a favor.
Just -- hopefully You'll make
  the right decision
and not counter
  and do something crazy,
because I really want
  to do the deal.
And your answer is,
  morri?
My answer is...
...kiss me.
[ laughter ]
All right.
  All right!
Ah.
  This is for you.
Thank you so much.
  Thank you.
Thank you.
Do a little dance.
  All right!
Daymond, you look
  like a cute elf.
[ humming ]
  [ laughter ]
That's scary.
[ laughter ]
WOMAN: Hi, honey.
  How are you?
We made a deal.
You made a deal?
We made a deal.
Chowaiki:
  It's a dream come True.
This is a winning
  lottery ticket.
This is unbelievable.
Honey,
  we're so proud of you.
Okay. Aww!
  Hi, babies!
DAUGHTER:
  Daddy, I miss you!
Love you!
To me,
  this is showing my kids
how important it is
  not to give up.
Narrator:
  Last season, Marine rob Dyer
pitched his energy drink
  ruckpack to the sharks.
Dyer: It's the world's first
  Peak performance nutrition shot,
designed and tested
  by Spec ops forces.
$150,000 from the two of us
  for 20%.
I'll take $150,000
  for 20%.
Cuban: All right.
  Congratulations, guys.
Narrator: Let's see
  how rob is doing now.
Dyer:
  Business has really taken off
since making a deal
  with Kevin and Robert.
Before we came on the show,
we had done $35,000 revenue
  the entire year.
10 months later, we're coming up
on half a million dollars
  in revenue.
We're even sponsoring
  our very own ruckpack jet.
What do you think?
Unbelievable.
You weren't kidding.
  It's the real thing.
The ruckpack jet's gonna be seen
  by millions of people.
It's the number-One piece
  at ever air show Across America.
So what's happening
  with the walgreen order?
We're gonna roll
  right into the entire chain.
So almost 9,000 stores.
Okay.
  That's a big deal.
Dyer: We just signed a deal
  with walgreens,
and they're gonna be putting us
  in over 8,600 stores nationally.
This means a $4 million deal
  for ruckpack,
and we're only gonna continue
  to grow from there.
Well, let's fire
  this thing up.
Whoa!
Wow!
Yeah!
DYER: Kevin and Robert
  have been amazing for ruckpack.
Their help has gone way Beyond
  just their checkbook.
  Herjavec: Whoo!
They help us out
  any time we need,
And you can tell
  that they really care
about the company
  and about the team.
  Oh, wow.
We're gonna be
  an actual contender
in the energy-Drink category,
which is unheard of
  for a new guy,
all because of the help that
  I've received from the Sharks.
Unbelievable.
  That's awesome.
Unbelievable.
Narrator: Next into the tank
  are a model and hair stylist
from Beverly hills with a way
  to enhance a woman's beauty.
