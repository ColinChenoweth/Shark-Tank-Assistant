My name is Morri Chowaiki.
I live in San Diego, California,
Chowaiki:
  My wife celebrates Christmas.
My name is Morri Chowaiki,
Yes, it is.
  Can we see them,
  morri?
Absolutely.
  Who would like to see them?
Greiner: Here.
  Cuban: We'd all like
  to see them.
O'Leary: We all would.
  All right. Fantastic.
Cuban: Yeah.
  Oh!
Down Goes morri!
  Down I go. Down I go.
Of this one.
  Herjavec: Where are you
  selling them, morri?
Currently we are selling
  in a big-Box retail store
Morri, baby,
  that's not a lot of sales.
Oh, well --
  Bubele, come on!
You got to step up
  your game.
  Wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.
  Morri, oy vey!
  Come on!
Let me tell you something.
  Let me tell you something.
Or could it be, morri,
that there's a little
  market confusion going on here?
Nope.
  But, morri,
  sales are poo-Poo.
So, here are the stats.
A national survey was done
that said that nearly 50%
of all jewish people
  in the United States
have married somebody
  of another faith.
So we feel
  that there is a target audience
of probably somewhere
  in the neighborhood
Morri, what are you gonna
  use the money for?
Number one --
  New product design.
O'Leary: Morri, one of
  the challenges about this,
it's
  a seasonal business.
I hate seasonality because,
  you know, you have one shot.
You either make
  too much or make too little.
It's always the same problem
  every year.
That's never gonna change
  with --
  Mr. Wonderful, I was waiting
  for you bring that up.
Morri,
  there's another problem.
When a family buys this,
  it's once.
  Mm-hmm.
They don't need to buy it again.
Subset of a subset
  of a subset market,
seasonal purchase,
  one-time-In-Your-Life only.
If you described hell on earth,
  that would be it.
[ chuckles ]
No, I think --
I'm sorry.
  I have to disagree.
In my heart, I know
  we got something special
My friend, morri,
  I'm out.
Daymond is morri's last chance
  at getting a deal.
Are you gonna
  make an offer on this?
  Uh...
there's no way
  this is going to be
a multi-million-dollar
  business ever.
  No.
I don't want scrooge
to interrupt my, uh,
  thought process here.
[ laughs ]
Morri, why are you even
  thinking about that?
I'm not looking
  for control.
Okay.
  I'm just looking
  for a happy chrikkahmas.
35%.
Can I ask, is it e-Commerce
  that you can bring?
Is it ret--
  I mean, w-What --
  GREINER: Morri. Morri.
You don't want to have
  an "Oh, no" Moment.
This is
  a licensing play.
  Okay.
You know, morri,
  do me a favor.
Just -- hopefully You'll make
  the right decision
Chowaiki:
  It's a dream come True.
This is a winning
  lottery ticket.
This is unbelievable.
Honey,
  we're so proud of you.
Okay. Aww!
  Hi, babies!
DAUGHTER:
  Daddy, I miss you!
Love you!
To me,
  this is showing my kids
how important it is
  not to give up.
