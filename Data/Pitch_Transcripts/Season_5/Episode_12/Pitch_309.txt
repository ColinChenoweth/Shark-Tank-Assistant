And even with the grinch
  in the tank...
[ laughter ]
  ...it's jollier than ever.
This stuff is hideous.
I hate this idea.
I can't believe
  I actually agree with Kevin.
You're dead to me.
Daymond.
  You're dead to me, too.
If you described hell on earth,
  that would be it.
Narrator: In the tank,
  hopeful entrepreneurs
get a once-in-a-Lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks
in hopes of
  getting an investment
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.
Our sales were $862,000.
  Whoa.
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,
or they'll
  walk away with nothing.
He will never get share
  in this market.
Ever, Ever, ever, ever!
NARRATOR:
  If the sharks hear a great idea,
they're ready to invest
  using their own money.
And now I'm gonna
  take it all off for you.
  Ooh.
Narrator: And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
Don't ever listen to Kevin
  on that stuff. He's the worst.
So I'm actually shocked scrooge
  has made you guys an offer.
I almost feel bad about it,
  but not really.
[ laughs ]
NARRATOR:
  Who are the sharks?
They're self-Made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert
Who grew
  his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand fubu,
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.
Robert herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner, the queen of qvc,
holds over 100 patents and
  has launched over 300 products
grossing over a half a billion
  dollars in retail sales.
And Mark Cuban --
Notorious billionaire
  entrepreneur, tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
is an entrepreneur
  from Lubbock, Texas,
with a solution to one of
  the holidays' biggest headaches.
and my company is Lite-Netics.
I'm seeking $125,000 in exchange
  for 20% of my business.
Now, everyone loves the festive
  atmosphere of the holidays.
All the food, all the family --
Okay,
  maybe not all the family.
But the decorations
and, of course, my favorite,
  the lighting.
Now, there is just one problem.
Nothing can ruin
  the holiday spirit quicker
than a tangled mess
  of holiday light strands.
The clips, the tabs,
  the glues, the screws --
All the tools needed
  to keep these attached.
Well, you know, it doesn't have
  to be so complicated anymore.
Introducing Lite-Netics.
[ chuckles ]
  ah.
Magnetic light strands.
These are the first and only
  light strands featuring a magnet
embedded at the base
  of each and every socket.
This allows for the quickest
  and easiest attachment
of any strands available.
So a decorating job
  that once took hours to complete
can now be done in just minutes.
Let me show you.
Hmm.
Voila . Just like that.
So now you can spend less time
on the roofs
  and off those ladders
and more time sipping nog
  around the old yule log.
So how many of you sharks
  are gonna team up with me
so we can light up this world?
Does it work
  on aluminum?
It does not work
  on aluminum.
How many homes have a metal
  that this would stick to?
A lot of them do, actually.
It just depends on the portion
  of the world you're at.
How many people know if they
  have metal in the Eaves or not?
Well, I think
  you can see that, can't you?
Well, I-It's real simple.
Well, metal or aluminum --
  I mean...
You know, commercial side --
  This is not just for resident.
But the commercial side,
  a lot of these are metal.
In the residential side,
  you're seeing a-a lot of --
of metal also,
  just depending on your gutter.
But let's put that aside
  for a second.
Okay.
  Tell me about
  the ones you've sold.
How have you sold those?
Well, I focused
  the last couple years
on targeting
  the professional installers.
They're out there working
  with your commercial builders,
commercial installers
  that do this on the side
during that holiday season.
For residential?
For both.
  Oh, interesting.
So, which retailers
  have picked you up?
I'm -- I'm working c-Currently
  with some buyers
for -- for home depot.
Okay.
  They --
  they like the product.
They've taken this product now,
and they're taking it
  to their factories
So they can get some pricing
and Costs down
  for the retail market.
That's the market
  that I'm trying to jump into.
  Oh.
What are
  the total sales?
  John: Okay, how much --
Total sales, yes,
  in the last year.
Last year,
  we did $118,000 in sales.
We netted $38,000.
  How long have you been
  in business?
We've been in business the last
  four seasons -- four years.
So what were your years
  prior to that?
Little over $400,000
  for the last 4 years.
  And so you're --
You're up a little bit,
  but about the same.
  John:
  On average, it's the same.
But it's about the same.
  You're not scaling it.
What I'm having problems with
  is some factories,
you know, trying to get
  my costs down a little bit.
When I first started this
  product and got this patent,
I pursued it, and I-I --
  It's cleared?
  The patent's cleared?
Yes.
  Wow.
You have something here,
  my friend.
  Greiner: You know what
  the biggest problem is,
I think is that magnets
  are actually expensive.
  Yes.
I've tried myself because
  I've made products with magnets,
and the problem is, is you just
  can't get the price down
after a certain point.
It --
  because it is
  what it is.
Right.
And how much
  would yours be?
Probably $70.
Oh.
  Ooh.
That's what it is currently.
Like I said, if we can work
  and get that product down --
  So --
if you were $25
  and they were $20,
you can get
  the price down.
  But it --
but are we even in the business
  of equaling their price?
  Absolutely.
Or is that an impossible road
  to go down?
  I think what we're --
what you're forgetting
  is -- Is if --
if you're doing it
  on some of these structures,
you got to buy
  the additional accessories --
the -- the clips and the tabs --
  and that's just more.
But they're plastic,
  so they're very cheap.
What is wrong with approaching
  one of the major players...
  that's a $50 difference.
...and saying,
  "I own this patent,
"and I have a cost disadvantage
  of my small scale.
I would like
  to show you this solution"?
because it's patented.
You're not -- You don't have the
  risk of them ripping you off.
Absolutely. I-I would --
  Why wouldn't you do that?
That opportunity
  hasn't arised yet
where I had someone come in
  and --
And, you know,
  offer license agreement.
But you --
  but have you called them?
  No, I-I have not.
Well, this is one of these deals
  where -- Where I can --
I feel -- I almost feel bad
  about it, but not really.
Ha!
  I mean,
  you want an offer?
Here's what it is.
I know how
  to call the two players
that globally own
  this market, okay?
I'll negotiate the deal
  with them.
You have the right to override
  me if you don't like the terms,
but I won't pay you the $125,000
  till we sign it.
Because I'm gonna get
  a massive advance on it.
But we're 50/50 partners.
Any other offers?
And I got to tell you,
  after four years,
you might be learning
  the same thing.
I'm out.
Okay.
Anyone else?
Look, the one issue
  to every professional installer
that's important to them
and is their biggest cost
  is their time.
To be able to say, "Your time
  is worth $50 or $100 an hour.
"I can save you
  two hours per install.
This is the product
  for you."
Then you don't have
  to fight the behemoths,
but I would focus
  on the professional installers.
I don't know how
  to reach that market,
and for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thank you.
Good advice,
  but no check.
Greiner: You have
  three problems, as I see it.
Number one
  is the cost is too high,
and I don't think you'll be able
  to manufacture it
ever apples to apples to
  the lights that are out there.
Number two, I don't know
  how many places it'll work.
Because you have to have metal
  that works with the magnet,
and a lot of homes
  have aluminum.
And number three is
  you also have something here --
This is a large bulb.
It's more -- I think they call
  it the old-Fashioned light bulb.
Yeah,
  it's a c9 socket. Mm-hmm.
  Yes.
And a lot of people today
are buying icicle lights
  for the home
and smaller bulbs
  for the home.
I don't think it's going to work
  in the retail market.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Daymond?
I believe that the only
  opportunity is the licenses.
I'll go head-to-head
  with him,
and I'll offer you
  the exact same deal,
but instead of 50%,
  I'll only take 40%.
Interesting.
Why do I have to provide
all the creativity
  to these deals?
Doesn't anybody have the ability
  to think on their own here?
This is ridiculous.
It's a challenge here.
  Greiner:
  You should be flattered.
I do this for a living.
  I'll give you an example.
It's the voyage-Air guitar guy
who didn't pick up the phone
  and call Fender or Gibson.
He had a fantastic technology.
I picked up the phone.
Now he's in Fender guitar.
And so I'm worth
  the extra 10%.
  Well, he has
  one of those examples.
I have four.
  I do the work.
  That's the difference.
I do the work as well.
  You get -- You get
  Mr. Wonderful.
I'm worth 10% more.
  That's the way I look at it.
  [ laughs ]
the Deal's gonna take me
  nine months to do.
I want you to know that
  it's gonna take a long time.
  That's right.
  It's gonna take me two.
So we need to do the deal.
  It won't happen that fast.
They will want to test it.
They will want
  to check their costs.
And you'll be negotiating
  the whole way through.
because Christmas
  is gonna come and go.
We need a decision.
  We need a decision.
Well, I appreciate
  both of them.
Would you be willing
  to go to 30%, Daymond?
Greiner: Ooh.
He didn't ask you.
No.
I'm hard on the 40%.
with some -- Some other big
  wholesalers and distributors.
Good luck.
  All right.
Good luck.
  Thank you.
So, Mr. Grinch
  and the little happy elf
couldn't get a deal today.
We did our worst,
  and that's all that counts.
He will never get share
  in this market.
Ever, Ever, ever, ever!
Genebacher:
  I needed a strategic partner.
I-I just think the equity,
  what they wanted,
was just too much for me,
and I just wasn't prepared and
  ready to -- to -- to give up.
with my wife and three kids.
1, 2, 3. Oh!
The holiday season
  in Our house is fantastic.
It's full of love, presents,
  tons of good food, and laughter.
Happy Christmas!
  Happy Hanukkah!
Looks great,
  but maybe a little -- No.
Not on your life.
And I celebrate Hanukkah.
  Children: Yay!
My product is a solution
  for the thousands and thousands
of interfaith families
  that live in the United States,
and it bridges the gap
between "Ho, ho, ho"
  And "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel."
Come on, guys.
  Get our orders out.
I have been selling my product
  now for three years.
I've already put a second
  mortgage out on our house
to make this dream come True.
We can't keep putting money
into this business ourselves.
Without an investment
  from the sharks,
I fear that we just
  won't make it.
Oh!
  Daddy!
This product
  is important to me
because it brought us together
  as a family.
And to be able to provide
  that same gift
to the millions of interfaith
  families that are out there
would just be a wonderful
  achievement in life for me.
[ chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
Hello, gefilte sharks.
And how are you?
  [ laughs ]
and I'm from san Diego,
  California.
My company is one life products,
and I'm here seeking $50,000
in exchange
  for 15% of my company.
Sharks, chrismukkah...
  [ laughter ]
...is the most wonderful time
  of the year,
a time when Interfaith families
  Can play spin the dreidel
while kissing
  under the mistletoe.
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if interfaith families
  could find a way
to truly capture the spirit
  of chrismukkah?
Well, mazel toe.
Because now they can
  with the Hanukkah tree topper.
It's the perfect pairing between
  all these holiday traditions,
and, hey, doesn't it look great
  on top of a Christmas tree?
No more debates between
  Candy canes or chocolate gelt
or Santa versus Hanukkah Harry.
[ laughs ]
  You get
  the best of both worlds
with the Hanukkah tree topper.
[ laughter ]
  together, I know we can take
  the Hanukkah tree topper
to the next level and make
  lots of shekels doing it.
So what do you say?
This holiday,
  let's reach for the star
and sell like meshuggener!
[ laughter ]
So, I-I want to make sure
  we understand this right.
Is the product simply the star
  to put on top of the tree?
There you go.
  And there is --
You can turn on
  the switch on that.
  So -- So one lights up,
  and one doesn't.
One does not.
Oh, there it is.
  Exactly.
How many of these
  have you sold?
I have sold approximately 12,000
  of that item right there.
as well as online
  and in a-a flight magazine.
What do you
  sell them for?
Sell those for $19.99.
  They cost $2.
So we have
  about a 70% wholesale Margin
and 90% retail margin.
Those are higher end.
We're at about $35.99
  and about, right now, a $9 cost
because it's our first run, and
  we expect costs to come down.
How much have you made
  on your 12,000 units?
  Our gross sales
  have been $150,000.
In the last 12 months.
No.
In the last three seasons.
Whoa.
This year --
We've got massive potential,
  and let me tell you why, okay?
[ laughter ]
  first of all --
I love when the answer
  to existing sales is potential.
Oh, no. This is --
  This is real potential.
of a million to a million
  and a half households
for this one item.
The retailer that we're in,
we're in about 200 --
  Almost 200 stores.
Herjavec:
  Which retailer is it?
  Bed bath &amp; beyond.
Is that the only retailer
  you're in?
In brick and mortar, yes.
What percent of sales
  are online,
and what are in retail?
I'd say 70% online,
  20% in-Flight magazine,
and the rest with stores.
We want to get our own website
  up and running
so that we're not relying
  on Sites and Commissions
and things like that.
I need some fulfillment space,
because we started
  not being able to park
  one car in the garage.
Now it's two cars in the garage,
  and my wife --
You're doing this all
  from home?
  Everything. 100%.
How much money
  have you put in?
About close to $130,000
  of our own money.
Wow.
And what's your answer?
My answer is, number one, first
  and foremost, you're right.
It is seasonal.
But number two --
  You're making the deal with me,
and I work
  12 months out of the year.
and that is -- and it's -- and
  it may be a niche, but it's --
but it's small.
Well, let me tell you what
  small is. Okay. So I've got --
I know what small is --
  your sales.
Thank you. Well...
  Hey, that's -- That's --
Numbers don't lie,
  my friend.
Well, let me explain
  what's coming.
I've been invited into
the largest mass-Market
  big-Box store,
one of the two
  largest drugstore chains,
the largest toy-Store chain,
as well as one of the largest
  discount-Clothing chains.
"Invited" means to show it
  or you have a purchase order?
"Invited" means to show it.
I understand.
You know, I can't believe
  I'm going to say this,
but...
I actually agree
  with Kevin.
And I don't think
  you have a big enough market
for this to become
  something really scalable
and a huge business
  for you.
Mm-hmm.
  And so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Lori,
  I'll be honest with you.
I want
  to do business with you.
And --
  Morri, she's out.
I'm out.
  All right.
Let me tell you this.
You're working
  in a full-Time job,
and you're working
  basically out of your garage.
The biggest challenge
  that I've ever experienced
with all my "Shark Tank"
  Companies
has been getting
  out of the garage
and getting into an office
  or whatever it may be,
and growing out
  of that home-Based business.
  Which is what I want.
I don't expect you
  to run my business.
What I want is your expertise
  behind, you know,
marketing, social search-Engine
  Optimization.
Look, it's what you want,
  but you're not set up
to do that right now,
  so for that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
I think you've done
  a good job here.
But 3 years later,
  you're at $60,000.
But I haven't even broke
  Brick and mortar yet.
For that reason,
  I'm out.
Okay.
Daymond.
You know, I-I did a deal
  with, uh, a rabbi.
Sure you did.
  Rabbi -- Rabbi Moshe.
Moshe. Um...
[ Laughs ]
Soundbender.
  Yeah.
Are you gonna
  make an offer on this?
Uh...
there's no way
  this is going to be
a multi-million-dollar
  business ever.
No.
Narrator:
  Four sharks are out.
Yeah, Christmas and Hanukkah
  are about faith, and I --
I just question your judgment.
  That's all.
I like --
  There's product extension.
If he has that,
  he may have some other stuff.
You know what? I-I think I want
  to take a Gamble on you.
Uh, $50,000 for 35%
  is my offer.
35%.
Wow.
And this is to do bulbs
  and Socks and other things,
as well
  as the primary product.
and not counter
  and do something crazy,
because I really want
  to do the deal.
And your answer is,
  morri?
My answer is...
...kiss me.
[ laughter ]
All right.
  All right!
Ah.
  This is for you.
Thank you so much.
  Thank you.
Thank you.
Do a little dance.
  All right!
Daymond, you look
  like a cute elf.
[ humming ]
  [ laughter ]
That's scary.
[ laughter ]
WOMAN: Hi, honey.
  How are you?
We made a deal.
You made a deal?
We made a deal.
designed and tested
  by Spec ops forces.
$150,000 from the two of us
  for 20%.
I'll take $150,000
  for 20%.
Cuban: All right.
  Congratulations, guys.
Narrator: Let's see
  how rob is doing now.
Dyer:
  Business has really taken off
since making a deal
  with Kevin and Robert.
Before we came on the show,
we had done $35,000 revenue
  the entire year.
10 months later, we're coming up
on half a million dollars
  in revenue.
We're even sponsoring
  our very own ruckpack jet.
What do you think?
Unbelievable.
You weren't kidding.
  It's the real thing.
The ruckpack jet's gonna be seen
  by millions of people.
It's the number-One piece
  at ever air show Across America.
So what's happening
  with the walgreen order?
We're gonna roll
  right into the entire chain.
So almost 9,000 stores.
Okay.
  That's a big deal.
Dyer: We just signed a deal
  with walgreens,
and they're gonna be putting us
  in over 8,600 stores nationally.
This means a $4 million deal
  for ruckpack,
and we're only gonna continue
  to grow from there.
Well, let's fire
  this thing up.
Whoa!
Wow!
Yeah!
DYER: Kevin and Robert
  have been amazing for ruckpack.
Their help has gone way Beyond
  just their checkbook.
  Herjavec: Whoo!
They help us out
  any time we need,
And you can tell
  that they really care
about the company
  and about the team.
  Oh, wow.
We're gonna be
  an actual contender
in the energy-Drink category,
which is unheard of
  for a new guy,
all because of the help that
  I've received from the Sharks.
Unbelievable.
  That's awesome.
Unbelievable.
Narrator: Next into the tank
  are a model and hair stylist
from Beverly hills with a way
  to enhance a woman's beauty.
Hi. I'm Rachel.
And I'm Melissa.
And we are the cashmere
  hair girls of Beverly Hills.
We are asking $45,000
  for a 15% stake of our company.
Every woman has had
  to fake it a time or two,
especially
  when it comes to beauty.
Not everyone is born
  with amazing hair.
But with hair extensions,
  women can enhance their hair
into the hair
  that they've always dreamed of.
As a professional hair Stylist
  and extension expert
in Beverly hills, I know
  clip-In hair extensions
are a great
  nonpermanent option.
Sharks,
  this is a real deal,
and there is
  nothing fake about it.
And now I'm gonna
  take it all off for you.
As you can see,
I'm going to unclip my hair
  from my head.
Herjavec: Oh, wow.
So you can see they are
  tracks attached to clips.
  Wow.
Can't tell
  the difference.
And I have two clips on each
  side of my head like that.
And then three
  that go along the back.
Here's the first one
  that goes along the back.
You have a whole shetland pony
  in your hair, huh?
It's all coming off.
It is all coming off.
  Greiner:
  A shetland pony.
As you can see, again,
  it is a big difference.
So it comes
  with the clips in it?
  Yep.
And I'm gonna show you
  how easy it is to clip back in.
Is it real human hair?
  It is.
Melissa: It is 100%
  all indian hair.
  Cuban: Can we see it?
So there's people in India
  getting their hair cut,
and they're
  sending you their hair.
Melissa: We work
  through a manufacturer,
and they're actually doing
  all the Supplying.
Weird.
  They actually go out and collect
  the hair, put it together.
There -- There's
  actually hair auctioners.
Come on.
  And they collect different
  qualities of hair and suppliers.
But --
  There's
  really low-Grade hair,
and you could go up
  to very high quality.
So that -- my next question is,
  how much is it per extension?
The cost for us on average
  is $105.
We retail these
  for $399.
How many pieces
  do you get for $399?
You get a full set of cashmere
  hair that is seven tracks.
How do you know with certainty
  it's human hair?
How -- I mean --
  [ laughs ]
Well, no,
  but I'm -- I'm serious.
No, no, no. Really.
  This is -- This is True.
You know, listen, it might be
  from the underbelly of a yak.
We have tested out
  about 20 suppliers,
so we'll get their hair
  over to us as samples.
For each batch?
  Yes.
All cuticle intact,
  it's called Remy.
We deal with the manufacturer
  and supplier
that only deals
  with Remy hair.
In this calendar year, how much
  of this are you going to sell?
We have been in business
  for six months,
and we have sold
  a total of $38,000.
But other people can buy
  from that same supplier.
Yes.
  Correct?
That's a possibility.
Anybody can.
  Right.
I have 10 years
as a professional hair stylist
  as an extension expert.
So I know what girls are looking
  for and what they want.
I've been a model
  for the last 10 years,
and I've been
  wearing hair extensions myself
for a really long time.
I used to have
  to make my own.
I would actually take apart
  other ones from other companies
and sew them together
so that they were full enough
  and thick enough and --
There's nothing worse.
  Nothing.
There isn't.
  It takes a long time,
  and also I didn't want
to have to wear
  a ton of metal clips on my head.
Let me ask you a question.
Does it concern you --
  Let's talk "Guy meets girl."
  Mm-hmm.
Guy looks at girl...
  [ Laughs ]
I don't even want to know
  where this is gonna go.
  ...says,
  "I really like this girl.
She has spectacular hair.
  Fantastic."
The next morning...
  a couple of dates go by,
  the special evening arrives,
and then you find out
  it's just all false advertising.
Well, isn't that with a lot
  of things women do, you know?
  I mean, do we have
  a problem with this?
A little bit --
  We cheat a little bit.
Why not enhance something
when someone could go
  from an 8 to a 10?
Taking a pretty girl
  and even making her prettier.
  [ laughs ]
HERJAVEC: So you've sold me
  it's a great product, okay?
$38,000 in sales in 6 months --
  Great start.
Yep.
  How do you now get all the women
  to know all about it?
Number one is we really want
  to make instructional videos
that are going
  to basically
help sell the product
  for us because --
Sell it where, though?
Online, uh...
  online. Oh, let me --
Okay, but, Rachel,
  how are people gonna know
you're out there to come to
  your website to watch the video?
Because we make our own beauty
  blogs, we utilize instagram.
We -- Social media has take--
  A huge help for us.
We know what works,
  and we're --
  right,
  b-But the challenge --
And where Robert was trying
  to get to --
The challenge isn't will
  you have a successful
  business, right?
Absolutely.
  You guys are there,
  right?
You've just got to
  keep on doing --
  What are you
  talking about, mark?
They've got $38,000
  in sales.
No, no, no.
  They know what they're doing.
Exactly. 'cause every business
  has to start somewhere.
And we're actually -- We're
  planning on going into salons,
and we want to have
  cashmere hair parties.
We want to be able
  to bring the hair to you.
You haven't had one yet,
  have you?
No, but we are having one
  at the end of the month.
The challenge is,
  can you grow that enough
to become a company that creates
  a return for an investor?
Your --
  You asked for $45,000.
  Correct.
And the reality is,
if you guys
  hustle and grind enough...
  mm-hmm.
...you can generate that
  $45,000, given your margins,
with just $90,000
  in sales or less.
And so while I think
  this is a great business,
I don't think
  this is a great business
suited for an investor,
  and so for that reason, I'm out.
Oh. Okay.
I think we could grow
  a lot faster, though,
if we actually
  do have an investment.
So,
  here's a question.
When you look
  at yours --
'cause there's tons
  of extensions out there.
Where do your prices compare
  to what's already out there?
Our price is more expensive
than almost all of the
  other clip-In hair
  extension companies.
But there's
  a good reason for it.
A lot of clip-In hair extensions
  sell for half of our price.
And it's because
  the quality is not good.
You cannot buy that kind of hair
  for that cheap.
You have -- You've gone
  to the high end, or at
  least you claim that.
You're telling me it's not
  yak hair. I'm gonna believe you.
But for an investor like me
  to look at this and say,
"How am I gonna turn this
into a multi-Million-Dollar
  business?"
I don't think I am.
I don't see the strategy
  that gets me there.
And for that reason...
  I'm out.
Okay.
Melissa, are you okay?
  Yeah.
All right,
  'cause you seem like you're --
You're frustrated,
  you're melting a little bit.
I-I guess I stand
  behind this so strongly.
  All right.
The challenge with this is this
  is purely about marketing.
And marketing
  is the black hole of a business.
And, uh...
  well, I think even in the past
  six months, we've been --
We've done pretty Well ourselves
  getting it out there.
  No, you have. You have.
And this doesn't mean
  that you guys --
So if we had help
  from Somebody like you,
it only would make se--
  You don't want help
  from me on hair.
[ both laugh ]
  trust me on that one.
It's a good point.
  I would have to agree
  with mark.
I don't think
  that this is something
that you need an investor
  at -- at this time.
And I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
There's one thing you said here
  today that I think is unique.
I think
  doing these home parties --
I think that if you focused
  on that --
  I'm with Lori.
I like the idea of the hair
  parties at salons and so on.
But you haven't done it.
Today,
  for me to invest in it,
I-I wish there was more
  substance to the strategy.
That's all.
  Well, I --
  and I'm gonna --
Look, I wish you the best
  of luck. I'm out.
Rachel: Lori?
  [ chuckles ]
we know that you can
  help us a lot.
I think that there are
  two products, right?
Those that are revolutionary,
and those that are like
  other things out there.
And when it's like other things
  already out there,
you have to really try
  much Harder
to get yourself known
  and to beat the competition.
I think it's going to be
  really hard for you
to get ahead
  of that competition.
So I'm out.
Thank you.
  Okay, thank you.
Good luck, you guys.
  Cuban: Good luck, guys.
  You'll be fine.
It's a very nice product.
Good luck.
  Good luck, guys.
Melissa: Thank you.
  Great hair. Great product.
Both: Thank you.
  Good luck.
Greiner: Thank you, guys.
  Good luck.
Herjavec: Well, she certainly
  believed in it.
Passionate --
  Very passionate.
Greiner:
  Very passionate, but --
  they have nothing.
And I'll tell you what else.
Where can I find a woman
  with Real hair?
[ laughter ]
RACHEL: I think we came here
  wanting a deal
and wanting everything
  that went along with it.
It's okay. Take a deep breath.
  Take a deep breath.
Melissa: It is crushing
  and a disappointment.
But life goes on.
Narrator:
  Next into the tank is a duo
with a new take
  on a favorite Christmas Staple.
And I'm Nick Morton.
Our company is Tipsy Elves,
  and our slogan is
"Not your mama's
  Christmas sweater."
We are seeking
  a $100,000 investment
for 5% of our company.
Before Tipsy Elves,
  Christmas sweaters were old,
they smelled terrible,
and you could only find them
  at your local Thrift store.
Tipsy Elves re-creates
those Christmas sweaters
  of the past
with fun, witty, high-Quality
  Christmas sweaters
that the whole family
  can enjoy.
And they fit great,
  too.
But don't take it from us,
  sharks.
See for yourselves.
Both: welcome to
  the Tipsy Elves fashion show.
John: [ laughs ]
O'Leary: [ sighs ]
first we have Greg.
Greg is wearing
  our runaway sleigh sweater,
where Santa's sleigh
  gets the best of him.
He's also wearing our popular
  Christmas bomber Hat.
Next up, we have adry.
She's wearing
  our elf sweater.
She's also wearing
  our believe Fanny Pack.
Next, we have Brad.
Brad is wearing our popular
  Hanukkah Sweater.
Next up, we have Nikki.
Nikki is wearing our
  bucktooth Rudolph sweater dress.
Oh, that's cute.
  Greiner: Yeah.
Mendelsohn: Last but certainly
  not least, we have Andrew.
Andrew is wearing our
  reindeer matchmaker jump suit,
which is brand-New
  this season.
Zip it up
  and watch them kiss.
All right, sharks,
  so you've seen
a little bit
  of what we have to offer.
Our beautiful models here
are gonna be
  handing out a sweater
to each one of you
  that we've picked out
along
  with Our bomber hat.
Herjavec: Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
  And they're ugly.
Ugly!
  No, trust me.
  They're really ugly.
Um, and the challenge we have
  is the returns.
So how much does
  each one cost to make?
$12 --
  $11.40 per sweater.
And what do you
  sell them for?
  And what do you
  sell them for?
Sell them for $65.
Oh!
  Wow.
Wow.
Greiner:
  What made you say one day,
"I'm gonna make
  ugly Christmas sweaters"?
and it wasn't a job
  that he wanted to pursue.
I had a background
  in s.E.O.,
So I started doing
  internet businesses,
like mostly
  informational websites
where I'd make money
  off ad revenue.
I saw there was a high demand
  for Christmas sweaters
based on search volume.
Why get into the wholesale
  retail side of it?
Doesn't that
  just complicate things
and increase
  your overhead?
Once you take
  a wholesale account,
you've got
  to support them,
you've got to interact
  with them,
you've got to make
  their buyers happy,
you've got to talk
  about next season.
At our core,
  we're an e-Commerce site.
Why risk it and go into a
  new area where you're uncertain
and you've got guys
  like Daymond
who know this stuff inside
  and out competing with you?
John: To mark's point,
  when you come over to our side,
you're gonna have to be able
  to take back inventory,
you're gonna have to have
  a warehouse the size of,
you know, two blocks.
It's gonna be a lot.
  Sure.
O'Leary: Everybody's
  echoing the same thing.
You shouldn't take this
  to retail, in my opinion.
We're pursuing
  the online strategy
as -- As much as we can.
Retail is the drug
  that everybody goes for.
They look at that order,
  and they say, "Wow,
  I got to fill that."
We have retailers
  coming to us,
and it's just hard for us
  to turn it -- to turn it down.
Look, it sounds like
  what you guys are good at
is s.E.O.
  And selling online.
But I'm getting the sense
that you think that there's
  a ceiling there.
Yeah. We're -- We're pretty
  maxed out on s.E.O.
2011, we were number one
  on "Ugly Christmas sweater,"
"Ugly Christmas Sweaters."
HERJAVEC: Do you guys do
  this full time?
I quit last year
  to focus on this full time.
And I was getting paid about
  $170,000 a year plus bonus,
so it was a bit
  of a wake up --
  Wow.
You wake up one night.
You got a $170,000 job, you say,
  "Ugly Christmas Sweaters!"
I mean,
  I'm -- I'm a risk-Adverse guy.
It's a testament to --
  to me believing in this.
Like, I-I really
  wouldn't walk away
from a $170,000 job
  on a -- on a whim.
Okay, but we know
  the sweaters are ugly,
but also the valuation
  is ugly.
Why don't you try and defend
  why this is worth $2 million?
The reason our valuation
  is at that point
is last year, we -- You know,
  we had $862,000 in sales.
It would have --
  if we would have not run out,
we would have had
  a little over a million.
Well, I'm looking at it, saying
  you have to give a discount
for the fact there's risk in
  the seasonality in the return.
Yeah, you know what? Don't ever
  listen to Kevin on that stuff.
He's the worst
  at valuations.
  I'm very good
  at it, actually.
I mean, you guys have --
  your -- your problem
is not valuation,
  all right.
If you're going to grow --
  Really?
Yeah, because some of us know
  how to grow past the valuation.
Some people look backwards.
  Some of us look forward.
  So, Mark, why don't you give
  them a $4 million valuation?
But doesn't matter.
  The valuation isn't the issue.
  Well, that's --
  It doesn't matter.
It's where you can go.
But the problem I have is that
  you really haven't explained
how you're going to grow.
I know you guys hate
  when it sounds like people
are, you know, getting away
  from their core competency.
It -- it probably sounds
  like that.
But it's -- It's really
  easily duplicating
what's worked here,
  and from our point of view,
we're maxing out everything
  we can possibly think of
when it comes
  to the E-Commerce side.
  And that's the problem.
Trying to do everything
  is what scares me significantly.
And so even though I think
  you've got a good business,
a growing business,
  I'm out.
Greiner: I think you're
  on a really good start,
but there's other companies
  that do this.
There's nothing unique.
I'm out.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Here's how it works.
I'm gonna give you
  the $100,000.
I want $2 a sweater
  till I recapture my 100K,
then it drops to $1 a sweater
  in perpetuity.
What equity
  are you taking?
  Zero. Zero equity.
And would you be involved
  in the business,
or would you
  mostly just be treating it
kind of like
  as a source of capital?
I-I work with All
  my entrepreneurs,
and I do everything I can
  to optimize
'cause our incentives
  are aligned.
I'm about money.
John:
  So I'm actually shocked.
Scrooge has made you guys
  an offer.
Do you like his offer?
I'd love to hear if --
  if there's any other
  offers on the table,
but we're definitely
  interested.
Herjavec: So, it's an
  interesting offer from Kevin.
It's actually not
  that bad an offer.
It's bad,
  but not that bad.
I love the fact
  that you left
a $175,000-a-year job
  to do this,
because that tells me
  you're all in, my friend,
and I love that level
  of commitment to it.
There's no going back
  for you.
No.
I don't have a problem
  with the retail.
You know, I think
  when you start out,
you try everything.
So here's my offer
  to you.
$100,000 for 10%.
Daymond's being very quiet.
  So we'd also like to --
  Yeah.
Yes, he is.
  What are you doing?
Robert -- $100,000,
  10% of the company.
Kevin -- $2 Per sweater
  until you get your money back,
  I'm not greedy.
  I don't need a --
till you get $100,000 back,
  and then $1 in Perpetuity.
Yes, that's correct,
  Daymond.
And you're
  going to do what?
You're the clothing man.
Yeah, um...
Oh, this is hard.
Narrator:
  Two sharks are out.
Nick and Evan have two offers
  on the table
from Robert and Kevin,
but the clothing expert,
  Daymond, is on the fence.
Oh, this is hard.
I'm really --
  I'm falling in love
with the product
  and the guys.
I just -- I still have inventory
  of ugly sweaters.
Exactly.
  That's the challenge.
And you'll be selling those
  to me.
  [ laughs ]
My challenge is exactly
  what mark has been saying.
This is very seasonal.
  You guys are doing great.
You guys are doing
  what I cannot do online, s.E.O.
You're gonna go
  to these big guys,
and after they're
  through with you guys,
they just let it go.
  Mendelsohn: And it's not --
We're not relying on
  their business. It's --
  It's just adding --
right, but if you're not relying
  on their business,
then I can't be of service
  to you.
You guys can go to $5 million
  and $10 million without anybody.
And --
  but you can help add
  to what we're doing
on the online side with your
  distribution channels and...
I can't.
  I can't add to that.
You guys
  are already doing that.
That's what
  mark is saying.
  He's a retail king.
So if you're going
  the retail strategy --
  I'm the retail king.
I can make --
  I can make goods for you,
but you're making the goods
  at the same price, so...
...I'm out.
O'Leary: So you have two offers
  on the table.
You basically have one from me
that doesn't take any
  of your equity away.
I give you $100,000.
You pay me $2 a sweater
  until I get my capital back
and then $1 in perpetuity.
Or you have
  an offer from Robert,
which was $100,000
  for 10% equity.
