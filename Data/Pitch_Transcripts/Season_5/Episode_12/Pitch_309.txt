Hi. I'm Rachel.
And I'm Melissa.
And we are the cashmere
  hair girls of Beverly Hills.
We are asking $45,000
  for a 15% stake of our company.
Every woman has had
  to fake it a time or two,
especially
  when it comes to beauty.
Not everyone is born
  with amazing hair.
But with hair extensions,
  women can enhance their hair
into the hair
  that they've always dreamed of.
As a professional hair Stylist
  and extension expert
in Beverly hills, I know
  clip-In hair extensions
are a great
  nonpermanent option.
Sharks,
  this is a real deal,
and there is
  nothing fake about it.
And now I'm gonna
  take it all off for you.
As you can see,
I'm going to unclip my hair
  from my head.
Herjavec: Oh, wow.
So you can see they are
  tracks attached to clips.
  Wow.
Can't tell
  the difference.
And I have two clips on each
  side of my head like that.
And then three
  that go along the back.
Here's the first one
  that goes along the back.
You have a whole shetland pony
  in your hair, huh?
It's all coming off.
It is all coming off.
  Greiner:
  A shetland pony.
As you can see, again,
  it is a big difference.
So it comes
  with the clips in it?
  Yep.
And I'm gonna show you
  how easy it is to clip back in.
Is it real human hair?
  It is.
Melissa: It is 100%
  all indian hair.
  Cuban: Can we see it?
So there's people in India
  getting their hair cut,
and they're
  sending you their hair.
Melissa: We work
  through a manufacturer,
and they're actually doing
  all the Supplying.
Weird.
  They actually go out and collect
  the hair, put it together.
There -- There's
  actually hair auctioners.
Come on.
  And they collect different
  qualities of hair and suppliers.
But --
  There's
  really low-Grade hair,
and you could go up
  to very high quality.
So that -- my next question is,
  how much is it per extension?
The cost for us on average
  is $105.
We retail these
  for $399.
How many pieces
  do you get for $399?
You get a full set of cashmere
  hair that is seven tracks.
How do you know with certainty
  it's human hair?
How -- I mean --
  [ laughs ]
Well, no,
  but I'm -- I'm serious.
No, no, no. Really.
  This is -- This is True.
You know, listen, it might be
  from the underbelly of a yak.
We have tested out
  about 20 suppliers,
so we'll get their hair
  over to us as samples.
For each batch?
  Yes.
All cuticle intact,
  it's called Remy.
We deal with the manufacturer
  and supplier
that only deals
  with Remy hair.
In this calendar year, how much
  of this are you going to sell?
We have been in business
  for six months,
and we have sold
  a total of $38,000.
But other people can buy
  from that same supplier.
Yes.
  Correct?
That's a possibility.
Anybody can.
  Right.
I have 10 years
as a professional hair stylist
  as an extension expert.
So I know what girls are looking
  for and what they want.
I've been a model
  for the last 10 years,
and I've been
  wearing hair extensions myself
for a really long time.
I used to have
  to make my own.
I would actually take apart
  other ones from other companies
and sew them together
so that they were full enough
  and thick enough and --
There's nothing worse.
  Nothing.
There isn't.
  It takes a long time,
  and also I didn't want
to have to wear
  a ton of metal clips on my head.
Let me ask you a question.
Does it concern you --
  Let's talk "Guy meets girl."
  Mm-hmm.
Guy looks at girl...
  [ Laughs ]
I don't even want to know
  where this is gonna go.
  ...says,
  "I really like this girl.
She has spectacular hair.
  Fantastic."
The next morning...
  a couple of dates go by,
  the special evening arrives,
and then you find out
  it's just all false advertising.
Well, isn't that with a lot
  of things women do, you know?
  I mean, do we have
  a problem with this?
A little bit --
  We cheat a little bit.
Why not enhance something
when someone could go
  from an 8 to a 10?
Taking a pretty girl
  and even making her prettier.
  [ laughs ]
HERJAVEC: So you've sold me
  it's a great product, okay?
$38,000 in sales in 6 months --
  Great start.
Yep.
  How do you now get all the women
  to know all about it?
Number one is we really want
  to make instructional videos
that are going
  to basically
help sell the product
  for us because --
Sell it where, though?
Online, uh...
  online. Oh, let me --
Okay, but, Rachel,
  how are people gonna know
you're out there to come to
  your website to watch the video?
Because we make our own beauty
  blogs, we utilize instagram.
We -- Social media has take--
  A huge help for us.
We know what works,
  and we're --
  right,
  b-But the challenge --
And where Robert was trying
  to get to --
The challenge isn't will
  you have a successful
  business, right?
Absolutely.
  You guys are there,
  right?
You've just got to
  keep on doing --
  What are you
  talking about, mark?
They've got $38,000
  in sales.
No, no, no.
  They know what they're doing.
Exactly. 'cause every business
  has to start somewhere.
And we're actually -- We're
  planning on going into salons,
and we want to have
  cashmere hair parties.
We want to be able
  to bring the hair to you.
You haven't had one yet,
  have you?
No, but we are having one
  at the end of the month.
The challenge is,
  can you grow that enough
to become a company that creates
  a return for an investor?
Your --
  You asked for $45,000.
  Correct.
And the reality is,
if you guys
  hustle and grind enough...
  mm-hmm.
...you can generate that
  $45,000, given your margins,
with just $90,000
  in sales or less.
And so while I think
  this is a great business,
I don't think
  this is a great business
suited for an investor,
  and so for that reason, I'm out.
Oh. Okay.
I think we could grow
  a lot faster, though,
if we actually
  do have an investment.
So,
  here's a question.
When you look
  at yours --
'cause there's tons
  of extensions out there.
Where do your prices compare
  to what's already out there?
Our price is more expensive
than almost all of the
  other clip-In hair
  extension companies.
But there's
  a good reason for it.
A lot of clip-In hair extensions
  sell for half of our price.
And it's because
  the quality is not good.
You cannot buy that kind of hair
  for that cheap.
You have -- You've gone
  to the high end, or at
  least you claim that.
You're telling me it's not
  yak hair. I'm gonna believe you.
But for an investor like me
  to look at this and say,
"How am I gonna turn this
into a multi-Million-Dollar
  business?"
I don't think I am.
I don't see the strategy
  that gets me there.
And for that reason...
  I'm out.
Okay.
Melissa, are you okay?
  Yeah.
All right,
  'cause you seem like you're --
You're frustrated,
  you're melting a little bit.
I-I guess I stand
  behind this so strongly.
  All right.
The challenge with this is this
  is purely about marketing.
And marketing
  is the black hole of a business.
And, uh...
  well, I think even in the past
  six months, we've been --
We've done pretty Well ourselves
  getting it out there.
  No, you have. You have.
And this doesn't mean
  that you guys --
So if we had help
  from Somebody like you,
it only would make se--
  You don't want help
  from me on hair.
[ both laugh ]
  trust me on that one.
It's a good point.
  I would have to agree
  with mark.
I don't think
  that this is something
that you need an investor
  at -- at this time.
And I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
There's one thing you said here
  today that I think is unique.
I think
  doing these home parties --
I think that if you focused
  on that --
  I'm with Lori.
I like the idea of the hair
  parties at salons and so on.
But you haven't done it.
Today,
  for me to invest in it,
I-I wish there was more
  substance to the strategy.
That's all.
  Well, I --
  and I'm gonna --
Look, I wish you the best
  of luck. I'm out.
Rachel: Lori?
  [ chuckles ]
we know that you can
  help us a lot.
I think that there are
  two products, right?
Those that are revolutionary,
and those that are like
  other things out there.
And when it's like other things
  already out there,
you have to really try
  much Harder
to get yourself known
  and to beat the competition.
I think it's going to be
  really hard for you
to get ahead
  of that competition.
So I'm out.
Thank you.
  Okay, thank you.
Good luck, you guys.
  Cuban: Good luck, guys.
  You'll be fine.
It's a very nice product.
Good luck.
  Good luck, guys.
Melissa: Thank you.
  Great hair. Great product.
Both: Thank you.
  Good luck.
Greiner: Thank you, guys.
  Good luck.
Herjavec: Well, she certainly
  believed in it.
Passionate --
  Very passionate.
Greiner:
  Very passionate, but --
  they have nothing.
And I'll tell you what else.
Where can I find a woman
  with Real hair?
[ laughter ]
RACHEL: I think we came here
  wanting a deal
and wanting everything
  that went along with it.
It's okay. Take a deep breath.
  Take a deep breath.
Melissa: It is crushing
  and a disappointment.
But life goes on.
Narrator:
  Next into the tank is a duo
with a new take
  on a favorite Christmas Staple.
