Hi. My name
  is Shawn Genenbacher,
Shawn, I want --
  A 50-Foot Strand
of traditional lights is --
  Is how much at home depot?
Maybe $20, $25.
Yeah, but, Shawn,
  there's two problems.
  Mm-hmm.
If you were talking
  about a 20% difference,
Let me --
  Let me clear the deck, Shawn.
I think you have
  a massive problem.
At a $50
  price difference --
I-I don't know if there is
  a residential market for this.
So I'm not sure
  that's the right path.
Herjavec: But, Shawn, you got
  to make a decision
Shawn, I have no flexibility
  in case you're thinking.
But I'll negotiate a better deal
  than he'll get.
I'm gonna have to decline.
Both offers?
Yes.
Wow.
You see
  a different path?
Yes. I'll continue on
  with the way I've been working.
I-I got some opportunities
Shawn, you're dead to me.
[ laughs ] Best thing that
  happened to you all day, Shawn.
Yeah.
John: Shawn...
you're dead to me, too.
[ laughter ]
  Cuban: Second-Best thing.
Good luck.
