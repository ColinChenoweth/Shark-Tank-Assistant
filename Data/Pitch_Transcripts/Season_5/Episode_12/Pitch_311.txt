Hi. My name
  is Shawn Genenbacher,
and my company is Lite-Netics.
I'm seeking $125,000 in exchange
  for 20% of my business.
Now, everyone loves the festive
  atmosphere of the holidays.
All the food, all the family --
Okay,
  maybe not all the family.
But the decorations
and, of course, my favorite,
  the lighting.
Now, there is just one problem.
Nothing can ruin
  the holiday spirit quicker
than a tangled mess
  of holiday light strands.
The clips, the tabs,
  the glues, the screws --
All the tools needed
  to keep these attached.
Well, you know, it doesn't have
  to be so complicated anymore.
Introducing Lite-Netics.
[ chuckles ]
  ah.
Magnetic light strands.
These are the first and only
  light strands featuring a magnet
embedded at the base
  of each and every socket.
This allows for the quickest
  and easiest attachment
of any strands available.
So a decorating job
  that once took hours to complete
can now be done in just minutes.
Let me show you.
Hmm.
Voila . Just like that.
So now you can spend less time
on the roofs
  and off those ladders
and more time sipping nog
  around the old yule log.
So how many of you sharks
  are gonna team up with me
so we can light up this world?
Does it work
  on aluminum?
It does not work
  on aluminum.
How many homes have a metal
  that this would stick to?
A lot of them do, actually.
It just depends on the portion
  of the world you're at.
How many people know if they
  have metal in the Eaves or not?
Well, I think
  you can see that, can't you?
Well, I-It's real simple.
Well, metal or aluminum --
  I mean...
You know, commercial side --
  This is not just for resident.
But the commercial side,
  a lot of these are metal.
In the residential side,
  you're seeing a-a lot of --
of metal also,
  just depending on your gutter.
But let's put that aside
  for a second.
Okay.
  Tell me about
  the ones you've sold.
How have you sold those?
Well, I focused
  the last couple years
on targeting
  the professional installers.
They're out there working
  with your commercial builders,
commercial installers
  that do this on the side
during that holiday season.
For residential?
For both.
  Oh, interesting.
So, which retailers
  have picked you up?
I'm -- I'm working c-Currently
  with some buyers
for -- for home depot.
Okay.
  They --
  they like the product.
They've taken this product now,
and they're taking it
  to their factories
So they can get some pricing
and Costs down
  for the retail market.
That's the market
  that I'm trying to jump into.
  Oh.
What are
  the total sales?
  John: Okay, how much --
Total sales, yes,
  in the last year.
Last year,
  we did $118,000 in sales.
We netted $38,000.
  How long have you been
  in business?
We've been in business the last
  four seasons -- four years.
So what were your years
  prior to that?
Little over $400,000
  for the last 4 years.
  And so you're --
You're up a little bit,
  but about the same.
  John:
  On average, it's the same.
But it's about the same.
  You're not scaling it.
What I'm having problems with
  is some factories,
you know, trying to get
  my costs down a little bit.
When I first started this
  product and got this patent,
I pursued it, and I-I --
  It's cleared?
  The patent's cleared?
Yes.
  Wow.
You have something here,
  my friend.
  Greiner: You know what
  the biggest problem is,
I think is that magnets
  are actually expensive.
  Yes.
I've tried myself because
  I've made products with magnets,
and the problem is, is you just
  can't get the price down
after a certain point.
It --
  because it is
  what it is.
Right.
Shawn, I want --
  A 50-Foot Strand
of traditional lights is --
  Is how much at home depot?
Maybe $20, $25.
And how much
  would yours be?
Probably $70.
Oh.
  Ooh.
That's what it is currently.
Like I said, if we can work
  and get that product down --
  So --
Yeah, but, Shawn,
  there's two problems.
  Mm-hmm.
If you were talking
  about a 20% difference,
if you were $25
  and they were $20,
you can get
  the price down.
  But it --
but are we even in the business
  of equaling their price?
  Absolutely.
Or is that an impossible road
  to go down?
  I think what we're --
what you're forgetting
  is -- Is if --
if you're doing it
  on some of these structures,
you got to buy
  the additional accessories --
the -- the clips and the tabs --
  and that's just more.
But they're plastic,
  so they're very cheap.
What is wrong with approaching
  one of the major players...
  that's a $50 difference.
...and saying,
  "I own this patent,
"and I have a cost disadvantage
  of my small scale.
I would like
  to show you this solution"?
because it's patented.
You're not -- You don't have the
  risk of them ripping you off.
Absolutely. I-I would --
  Why wouldn't you do that?
That opportunity
  hasn't arised yet
where I had someone come in
  and --
And, you know,
  offer license agreement.
But you --
  but have you called them?
  No, I-I have not.
Well, this is one of these deals
  where -- Where I can --
I feel -- I almost feel bad
  about it, but not really.
Ha!
  I mean,
  you want an offer?
Here's what it is.
I know how
  to call the two players
that globally own
  this market, okay?
I'll negotiate the deal
  with them.
You have the right to override
  me if you don't like the terms,
but I won't pay you the $125,000
  till we sign it.
Because I'm gonna get
  a massive advance on it.
But we're 50/50 partners.
Any other offers?
Let me --
  Let me clear the deck, Shawn.
I think you have
  a massive problem.
At a $50
  price difference --
I-I don't know if there is
  a residential market for this.
So I'm not sure
  that's the right path.
And I got to tell you,
  after four years,
you might be learning
  the same thing.
I'm out.
Okay.
Anyone else?
Look, the one issue
  to every professional installer
that's important to them
and is their biggest cost
  is their time.
To be able to say, "Your time
  is worth $50 or $100 an hour.
"I can save you
  two hours per install.
This is the product
  for you."
Then you don't have
  to fight the behemoths,
but I would focus
  on the professional installers.
I don't know how
  to reach that market,
and for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thank you.
Good advice,
  but no check.
Greiner: You have
  three problems, as I see it.
Number one
  is the cost is too high,
and I don't think you'll be able
  to manufacture it
ever apples to apples to
  the lights that are out there.
Number two, I don't know
  how many places it'll work.
Because you have to have metal
  that works with the magnet,
and a lot of homes
  have aluminum.
And number three is
  you also have something here --
This is a large bulb.
It's more -- I think they call
  it the old-Fashioned light bulb.
Yeah,
  it's a c9 socket. Mm-hmm.
  Yes.
And a lot of people today
are buying icicle lights
  for the home
and smaller bulbs
  for the home.
I don't think it's going to work
  in the retail market.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Daymond?
I believe that the only
  opportunity is the licenses.
I'll go head-to-head
  with him,
and I'll offer you
  the exact same deal,
but instead of 50%,
  I'll only take 40%.
Interesting.
Why do I have to provide
all the creativity
  to these deals?
Doesn't anybody have the ability
  to think on their own here?
This is ridiculous.
It's a challenge here.
  Greiner:
  You should be flattered.
I do this for a living.
  I'll give you an example.
It's the voyage-Air guitar guy
who didn't pick up the phone
  and call Fender or Gibson.
He had a fantastic technology.
I picked up the phone.
Now he's in Fender guitar.
And so I'm worth
  the extra 10%.
  Well, he has
  one of those examples.
I have four.
  I do the work.
  That's the difference.
I do the work as well.
  You get -- You get
  Mr. Wonderful.
I'm worth 10% more.
  That's the way I look at it.
  [ laughs ]
the Deal's gonna take me
  nine months to do.
I want you to know that
  it's gonna take a long time.
  That's right.
  It's gonna take me two.
So we need to do the deal.
  It won't happen that fast.
They will want to test it.
They will want
  to check their costs.
And you'll be negotiating
  the whole way through.
Herjavec: But, Shawn, you got
  to make a decision
because Christmas
  is gonna come and go.
We need a decision.
  We need a decision.
Well, I appreciate
  both of them.
Would you be willing
  to go to 30%, Daymond?
Greiner: Ooh.
He didn't ask you.
No.
I'm hard on the 40%.
Shawn, I have no flexibility
  in case you're thinking.
But I'll negotiate a better deal
  than he'll get.
I'm gonna have to decline.
Both offers?
Yes.
Wow.
You see
  a different path?
Yes. I'll continue on
  with the way I've been working.
I-I got some opportunities
with some -- Some other big
  wholesalers and distributors.
Good luck.
  All right.
Good luck.
  Thank you.
Shawn, you're dead to me.
[ laughs ] Best thing that
  happened to you all day, Shawn.
Yeah.
John: Shawn...
you're dead to me, too.
[ laughter ]
  Cuban: Second-Best thing.
Good luck.
So, Mr. Grinch
  and the little happy elf
couldn't get a deal today.
We did our worst,
  and that's all that counts.
He will never get share
  in this market.
Ever, Ever, ever, ever!
Genebacher:
  I needed a strategic partner.
I-I just think the equity,
  what they wanted,
was just too much for me,
and I just wasn't prepared and
  ready to -- to -- to give up.
