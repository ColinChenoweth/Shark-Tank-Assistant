My name is Brian Whiteman,
and this is my baby mama,
Julie.
We're from Chatsworth,
California,
and today we are seeking
$150,000
for 20% of our company,
Groovebook.
Billions of photos are taken
every day from smartphones.
Who doesn't have a phone
with hundreds,
if not thousands, of photos?
What do people do with all
the photos they've taken?
Absolutely nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
For just $2.99 a month,
including shipping and handling,
the Groovebook app
allows you to choose
up to 100 photos every month
from your smartphone
and create a beautiful, bound
photo book in just minutes.
Each month, your Groovebook
gets delivered to you
with an exciting new cover.
Your photos
are automatically stamped
with the date and location
so you will never forget.
They're perforated,
for easy removal,
and 4x6,
which is the perfect size
for framing and sharing.
Who is that?
Is that you?
Is that you as a little one?
Why, it is.
Aw!
You had hair?
GREINER: [ laughs ]
I have never seen you with hair.
Groovebook will save you
time and money
from printing out your photos
at the store
and on ink cartridges
at home.
Forget those expensive
photo books.
They'll take you hours
online
and then charge you an arm and
a leg for printing and shipping.
Groovebook is the answer.
So, which one of you sharks
is ready
to get your groove on...
With Groovebook?
With Groovebook?
Oy.
Now my beautiful wife
of 15 years
is gonna give each one of you
your own custom Groovebook.
Oh, wow.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
CUBAN: Thanks, Julie.
Okay.
So, Brian?
BRIAN: Yes.
What do you charge me
for the book?
You get that entire book
for $2.99 a month,
including shipping and handling.
Wow.
That's a really great price.
Thank you.
How are you doing it
for that low of a price?
What does it cost you
to make the book?
It costs me $2.30
to make the book.
So,
you have a very small profit.
We have a 70-cents profit margin
per book.
Wow!
Do you have any sales?
Yes, we do.
Okay.
We have 18,000 paid subscribers
in the last 8 months.
Good for you.
Oh.
BRIAN:
18,000 paid subscribers.
So, what are you making
per month?
Do the math for me.
Well, right now,
we're not making any money.
We need to get to 30,000
customers to break even.
After we get to
30,000 customers,
we make 70 cents
every book.
Why aren't you making money now?
Because our overhead's
$21,000 a month.
Who's making these, though?
We manufacture the books
internally ourselves
in our print shop.
Now, why haven't you --
or have you tried another price?
Because we want everybody
in America
to be able to afford
this book,
and we didn't want to have
any excuses --
come on, guys.
I mean, look --
nobody in America can get it
if you close the business.
GREINER: Right.
No.
Yeah, everybody in America?
When I hear that,
it's just, like, "be real."
how much have you guys invested
in this company?
I've invested $400,000.
Oh.
HERJAVEC: Wow.
BRIAN: Yeah.
Wow. Wow.
If you didn't own
a printing business,
if I took this book and took it
to another commercial printer,
would my costs be
what you're charging today?
It'd be higher.
It'd be higher.
No, because I've developed
proprietary software
and specialized equipment --
Was Mark right?
would it be higher?
It would be higher.
But you understand
the problem with that?
Yes, yes.
I need your other business
to stay in business
with this business.
You know, I don't think
you ever explained
why we have the groove
in the side of the book.
One night
in Brian's frustration --
he was working on this
for months
trying to figure out
how to get this book flexible
so that we can mail it bulk
through the U.S. postal service.
He was beating with a pen
at the spine of the book.
He was so mad and frustrated.
Then he came to me, he's,
like, "Julie, Julie, wake up!"
and he showed me the photo book,
and it was all damaged,
and I said to him,
"What are you showing me?"
and he said,
"Look, it's flexing.
It's flexing.
I have the answer."
we will now
be able to ship the book
at about 80 cents apiece.
So because this book
is flexible, and this is --
we have a patent pending
on the groove inside the book.
Because it's flexible,
I'm able to mail it
for 82 cents.
So, that is the value
proposition in your business.
So, if you changed the postage
because of the new binding,
what does it cost?
It'll go up $3 to $4.
So, anyone
that tries to compete with us
is gonna have $4
just in postage.
And you're saying you can
protect this groove in it
because it's patent pending?
Yes.
CUBAN:
That's what I'm saying,
that's the most valuable asset
that you have.
this is really amazing.
Brian, can I --
can I ask you a question
as a potential investor?
Mm-hmm.
Would you consider raising
your price by a dollar?
Yes,
we would be open to that.
CUBAN: See, I think that's
the wrong business altogether.
I say Groovebook
as a service...
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
...Okay, that starts
to get interesting.
So, I can go to Shutterfly
and say,
"Shutterfly, you can't offer
something like this.
You have high shipping."
Right, their average book
is $30 a book.
Ours is $2.99.
Forget the pricing.
I want to make it a service
so that --
the problem is you don't own
that customer.
What's that?
You don't own that customer.
HERJAVEC: No, no,
but Mark is dead-on.
Mark is --
what you have here --
you don't own the customer
anymore.
This is a unique act,
the groove and the ability to
ship and create these pictures
so inexpensively through you.
Entrepreneurs lie to themselves
all the time.
They get visions of grandeur,
and here you are giving us
those visions of grandeur
by saying you want this for
every home in America, right?
Get over that.
Wouldn't you rather
be able to say to all those --
all those applications that
you're competing with right now,
"Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah,
I've got a groove
and I can ship this for 82 cents
and you can't"?
But if you want to offer this
to all your customers,
I'm gonna give you
an interface,
and I'm gonna charge you 7 cents
a picture.
You become a commercial printer
in his scenario.
No, no, better yet,
all you do is you become
a money collector.
I think Mark's dead-on.
There are
so many applications,
as more photo sites come up
and people upload to them.
You've done something
none of them can do
at that price point.
Yes! Okay, guys,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I'll give you $150,000
for 100% of the rights
to sell Groovebook
as a service through
your commercial printer
to everybody else.
You keep 100% of the Groovebook
subscription service.
I want to license this
as a service,
and then I can go to everybody
and say,
"Look, 82 cents to ship this,
$2.30 to print it.
I'm gonna mark it up
by 3 bucks."
if Shutterfly, Flickr,
whoever it is -- Picasa --
this way you can offer it
to all your customers.
Brian,
I think it's a phenomenal idea.
Thank you.
But this business
does not exist
without your commercial
printing business.
Your costs are artificially low
because of your other business.
I have a problem with that.
If I get into business
with Groovebook
and the commercial
printing business goes away,
what do I do?
Like, I -- it's so symbiotic.
They're so related.
One doesn't exist
without the other.
That's why your price point
is so low
because you're able to do that.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
Robert made a point.
I'm a partner in Groovebook.
You go out of business or
you decide to raise the prices
or anything else happens
with your commercial printer,
I have a problem.
I'm out.
Would you consider selling me
the whole thing?
At the right price.
Well, you've put a value on it
of $750,000, right?
Correct.
Would you consider selling
the whole thing?
And by the way, Brian,
that's what you walked in here
asking for.
I gave you what you wanted.
Yes, but we'd like to have
some upside on that, also.
So, Mark, I'd like to just
clarify a little bit more,
one more time, please.
CUBAN: Sure.
So, in essence,
I'm paying you 150k
to be the right to be,
hopefully, your commercial
printing company's
largest Groovebook supplier.
HERJAVEC:
So, Brian, Julie,
you've got $150,000
for a pure licensing deal.
You keep 100% of your business.
Okay.
The other offer from Kevin
is the full value
of what you put on your company,
$750,000,
for 100% of the business.
Two completely different
avenues.
Totally different.
So, so --
I think we'd like
to counter Kevin's offer.
Yeah, we'd like to counter
Kevin's offer,
and we think the company
at this stage of the game
is worth $6 million.
Oh!
Oh!
Wow.
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.
Brian and Julie
have two offers on the table --
one from Mark for $150,000
for the licensing rights
to Groovebook
and one from Kevin,
who has offered $750,000
to buy 100% of the company.
Two completely different
avenues.
Totally different.
So, so --
I think we'd like to counter
Kevin's offer.
Yeah. We'd like to counter
Kevin's offer,
and we think the -- the company
at this stage of the game
is worth $6 million.
Oh!
Oh!
Wow.
But you valued it
at $750,000.
Because we want to be
a part of the upside.
If you don't want to sell
100% of it, I understand,
but you can't take the price
and multiply it by 6
to sell control.
Nobody would do that to you.
Sure, they can.
They can do whatever they want.
No, but it won't happen.
The transaction won't occur.
Are you saying yes or no
to their $6 million?
No, I won't pay $6 million for
it, and you knew I wouldn't.
Is there some middle ground?
And you don't want us to have
any skin in the game
and grow it with you?
well, I do, but I'm just --
I asked you simply to understand
you as an entrepreneur,
where your head's at.
Do you want to sell out?
Is there a price
that makes sense?
The answer is no. I get it.
We want to have more skin
in the game. We --
how much skin in the game
do you want, my friend?
I'd like to have
at least 50%.
You want me to grow
the business.
We are so passionate --
that's why my deal was perfect
for you, then.
JULIE: You have to understand,
Brian --
your deal is -- is --
it makes a lot of sense,
but with yours,
I'd like to have a little bit
of skin in the game
rather than 100% royalty because
I'm manufacturing for you.
What do you think 50%
of Groovebook is worth today?
Kevin.
[ indistinct conversation ]
it's worth $375,000.
and it's a no-brainer.
All we want to do is we want to
make a win-win situation.
So you would sell --
okay, you would sell
50% of Groovebook for $375,000?
Listen, we're gonna --
Mark and I are just gonna step
aside for one second, okay?
GREINER: If you'll do that --
HERJAVEC: What are you --
if you'll do that,
then I will give you the deal.
You do not want to do a $375,000
for 50%. You don't.
$375,000 for 50%, but I don't
want to be competing with Mark.
Yeah, I'll jump in on her
with that deal.
I don't want to compete
with Mark,
because I don't want there to be
all these other people out there
using the same technology.
If you get the patent,
I would be willing to give you
the $375,000,
and if Robert
wants to go in on it --
happy to go in with it.
Great, at 50% -- 25%/25%.
But the whole business.
No licensing to somebody else.
Right.
You got to control
the whole thing.
Not doing what Mark is saying.
And if you'll do it right now,
we can have a deal.
Brian, you said you'd sell 50%
for $375,000.
Will you do the deal?
Hell, no.
Are you kidding?
He's smarter than that.
O'LEARY: Okay, guys.
No, no, no, no, hang on.
Hang on.
Maybe that's
a better deal.
Lori made an offer.
I'd like to hear their offer.
Okay,
let me say what we decided.
$150,000 for a license
to the name and the software
and the ability to offer it
as a service.
80% for Kevin and I,
20% for you,
so you share in the upside.
What we're gonna be
is the one-off guys.
Mm-hmm.
So when someone says, "I have
375 pictures on my camera.
"I don't want a subscription.
I want a place where I can go
and buy it."
You'll be
the owner of Groovebook
and the Groovebook
subscription service.
We'll be Groovebook
for all one-off applications
or purchases.
Okay.
HERJAVEC: But, Brian,
you realize that --
that is a really bad thing
to do.
He's giving an alternative
to all your customers
that you're trying to build
a business to.
They don't have to be
subscribers.
He's building a competitive
one-off business.
It's kind of like the movie
"there will be blood."
[ laughter ]
You know, the guy had the oil,
and, you know, he didn't
want to give up the oil
