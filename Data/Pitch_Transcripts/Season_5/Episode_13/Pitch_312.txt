Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim Lewis.
I'm from Chester County,
Pennsylvania,
Jim, are you --
are you an engineer?
Are you a chemist?
Are you a doctor?
Oh, no, I'm a real doctor.
I'm a forensic pathologist.
So, Jim, for a living,
you see dead people.
I do.
All right.
So, Jim,
let me ask you something.
Three years ago,
you created this?
Three years ago.
So, what are your sales?
Right now, I've sold a couple.
Uh, we sold 80,000.
Okay.
That's not a couple.
What is your gross sales?
Our gross sales was $600,000.
Oh.
Wow!
Jim, do they have a projection
for next year?
Between a half million
to a million.
Whoa.
But I realize,
you can drown in success.
I've had people come to us
NARRATOR: Jim has four offers
on the table.
Robert has offered $150,000
for zero equity,
but he wants
the exclusive rights
to sell the product
internationally.
Kevin has offered $150,000
for 15% of the company,
contingent on
licensing the product
to Daniel Day-Lewis,
so Daniel Day-Lewis
bought the house next to him.
