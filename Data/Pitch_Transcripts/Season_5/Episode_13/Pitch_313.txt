My name is Thomas Hill.
Come here, boo.
I live in Anthem, Arizona,
with my wife, our daughter,
and our twin boys.
Started playing football
in high school,
and I quickly noticed
that that was my ticket
out of the rough area
that I grew up in.
Growing up was a struggle.
My father was never around,
and my brother and I
would watch our mom fight
to put food on the table.
I had the opportunity to go
to Kansas State University,
and I was selected
by the Green Bay Packers in 2004
as a free-agent tight end.
I had a college injury
that was hindering me,
and it ultimately led
to me being released
by the Green Bay Packers.
Are you guys ready?!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
All right,
let's go, let's go, let's go!
I wasn't about to let
being released by the NFL
kill my dreams.
I've taken
a unique business model,
mixed it
with my athletic background,
and created something
that allows kids to have fun,
be fit, and stay engaged.
Go, go, go!
There's no doubt in my mind
that the sharks are gonna love
my product.
They're entrepreneurs
just like me,
and I hope the sharks can see
what my product can do
for all kids across the country
and give me a deal.
[ whistle blows ]
Hello, sharks.
My name is Thomas Hill.
I'm the founder and creator
of Bounce Boot Camp.
I'm here seeking $30,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.
Sharks,
we face a huge challenge today.
1 in 3 children are obese,
and that number
only continues to grow.
But, sharks, we have a business
here that can change that.
We have a unique system here
called Bounce Boot Camp.
Bounce boot camp
is the first and only
mobile company of its kind
that combines the fun of
inflatable obstacle courses,
slides, and castles, into a fun
fitness program for kids.
How I came about this idea --
my lovely daughter, Jada, here
actually invited me to bounce in
a bounce-house castle with her
one day.
After bouncing
for roughly three minutes,
I quickly found
my heart rate was up,
my legs were burning,
I was sweating like crazy.
I thought,
"Man, a fit guy like me?"
whoa.
Right then, sharks, it hit me.
How awesome would it be
to create a fitness program
for kids
all based around
using the inflatables?
That night, sharks,
I created Bounce Boot Camp.
These young junior generals
would like to show you
that fitness really can be fun.
Is that all right?
Yep.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Are you guys ready?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Sweet, let's do it!
Let's do it.
Kira, you're right here
on the battle ropes.
Andrew Morgan,
plank one position.
Jada, you're in the squats.
Here we go. Let's show 'em
how we make it look good.
Ready, set, go!
Come on, Andrew Morgan.
Get through there.
Beat that ground up, Kira.
Wow!
Beat that ground up.
Let's go, let's go.
Dang.
Let's go.
Yeah, let's go, Jada.
Get through there.
Kira, give me the up-downs.
All right.
Give me the up-downs, Kira.
You didn't even know
you had abs, did you?
[ laughs ]
That looks good right there.
Come on, Jada, finish.
Three...Two...One.
Oh, my God.
Look how long he's doing that.
Ahh, great job, guys!
That's what I'm talking about.
Good workout.
Nicely done, guys.
We can put a Bounce Boot Camp
in every single city
across the country.
Which one of you --
or all of you --
are ready to help me
bounce out obesity?
In fact, which one of you --
or a couple of you --
would like to come down
and have a little bit of fun
with fitness?
There we go. Let's go.
You can take your jackets off.
Come on, Rob.
This is you all day.
All right, I want to try.
Come on.
Get in there.
I want to see Daymond
do a plank.
Right, I'm gonna have you
right here, Mr. Mark Cuban,
in a plank one.
yes, sir.
You're gonna race
this young gentleman to the end,
touch the ground, and then
you're gonna come back.
You want me to get through
that thing?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Ready, set, go!
Come on, Andrew Morgan!
Come on, Andrew Morgan!
Come on, Andrew Morgan!
Come on, Andrew Morgan!
Come on, Andrew Morgan,
let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Get through there!
Look at that.
He's already coming back.
Where you at, Cuban?
Where you at, Mark Cuban?
[ laughter ]
Come on, Cuban.
You can do it, baby!
Nicely done.
Nicely done, my man.
Daymond, I'll take you.
You guys are gonna be
in a plank one position.
Plank. Come on, now.
Don't cheat. There we go.
Ready, set, go!
GIRL: Go!
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!
[ laughter ]
JOHN: Get off me!
Get off me!
No cheating, no cheating.
No cheating.
Go, Daymond.
Come on, let's go!
Daymond's got the lead!
Come on, Daymond!
[ cheering ]
[ laughter ]
Nicely done.
That was harder than it looked.
It was.
Great job, great job, great job.
Yay, Daymond!
All right!
Kid signs up, they get a bounce
boot camp dog tag like this.
Here we go.
That was a lot of fun.
Great job, great job.
Thank you.
Great job, great job.
I think I ripped my trousers,
but I'm good.
[ laughter ]
Great job.
CUBAN:
I want a rematch!
Great job.
We can get that for you.
Tom,
tell us about the business.
How do you make money
with an inflatable boot camp?
So, our company
is a mobile company.
We have a 6x12 trailer.
It's a business in a box.
So, you show up with the
trailer, you blow it up.
We blow it up.
Each camp has a different
configuration of inflatables,
so one day you'll show up,
there's three.
The next day you show up,
there's four or five.
And how do you get the space
for the camp?
We do it at schools, parks,
rec centers, gyms.
We've even done it
on the large stadiums, as well.
You have to pay rent
for that space?
Absolutely.
You have to pay for the rent
at some locations.
How long is a class?
Each class is 60 minutes.
So, what we have
is a fitness camp.
So, basically what happens
is kids sign up
for either 8, 16, or 24 classes.
They're $99 to $250,
and they can earn
different-colored dog tags
as they promote
through the ranks.
So, it's kind of like karate,
but with Bounce Boot Camp,
we have privates, captains,
sergeant, majors, colonels,
and junior generals, as well.
That's very cute.
We want to actually license this
out across the country
and put Bounce Boot Camps in
every single city and state.
What's your background?
My background is fitness.
I'm a children's fitness
specialist.
So, then, tell us
about the revenues.
Great question.
So, right now,
in 16 months of sales,
we did $43,000 in sales.
And that's working
one day a week.
What about the last month,
Thomas?
Is there a trending
month over month?
So, the last month,
in our actual sales,
we've roughly been
about 2,500 bucks.
O'LEARY: Thomas, if I want to
set up mine in Boston,
what does it cost?
The business is $40,000, okay?
Whoa.
It's $40,000.
For us, it's $20,000 is the cost
for all of the equipment,
the trailer.
HERJAVEC: But you haven't sold
any yet, right?
That is correct.
It's an idea.
That is correct.
And what I --
CUBAN: Thomas,
I love what you're doing,
and I always respect
entrepreneurs -- their grind --
because most don't have
the fortitude
just to fight through it.
Sure thing.
Right.
So, you said you're working
still one day a week?
Correct.
What are you doing
the other six days?
I do pharmaceutical sales.
You've got
a full-time job.
You have at least one daughter,
right?
Right.
I do have twin boys.
Okay, so you got three of 'em,
right?
So you're caught in that
entrepreneur's dilemma.
Do I keep my job
'cause I got bills to pay,
or do I go for it?
right.
And $30,000 is not enough
for you to go for it,
and it's not enough for you
to really commit
to doing something bigger
by hiring people.
Right.
And so because
you're in between,
as much as I love the concept
and I respect what you're doing
and just the effort
you've put in,
I don't think
you're ready to be a business
that takes on
an investor yet.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
GREINER: You know what?
I personally think
really clever,
very creative, great idea.
Thank you.
What you should be doing
instead of thinking franchises
is really making it
something solid, year-round,
that works for you
in Arizona.
But because
you're not there yet,
I don't think there's something
to invest in at the moment.
Okay. Okay.
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thomas, I think your business
model is flawed, okay?
I don't think
this is gonna work.
Might as well get the truth
from me.
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.
I'd love to hear
what you have to say about it.
That's not true.
But here's the problem.
You're gonna try and sell me
this for $40,000.
The guy next door to me
doesn't have to pay that much
to buy the same thing.
There's nothing proprietary
about this.
I disagree with that.
It takes time to put
this program together,
and that's exactly
what I've done.
So when you say it's flawed, I
disagree with you, respectfully.
Had you sold 10 of them
already
and convinced people
to pay you $40,000,
that would have been
more impressive to me.
I want the proof,
my friend.
You don't have it.
I'm out.
I appreciate that.
Thomas, I just think
it's a little too soon.
Before you go out,
this is a start-up,
and how great would it be to be
able to be in the ground floor?
And I'm not asking
for a large investment.
I'm really not.
I'm asking for $30,000.
That's not
a very large investment.
I'm asking for a little bit of
time, a little bit of patience,
and I'll do the work.
I'm not asking you to work.
I don't need any of you to step
outside of what you do right now
and work for me.
That's not why I'm here.
I respect
how hard you're working.
But I don't see how I can invest
today to help grow my money.
I wish you all the best,
my friend.
I'm out.
JOHN: Tom, we have to be honest
with you.
You know,
you have a noble cause.
You're getting kids
off the couch.
I don't know when the last time
I heard a kid say,
"I'm gonna go out in the street
and play football."
absolutely.
But at this point,
the business model doesn't work.
I have to be out.
Oh, man.
Man.
Thomas, you got all
the best advice in the world.
Just take that advice
and run with it.
No, you're right.
You're right, absolutely.
Good luck, man.
Thanks for the opportunity.
I'll be back.
Thank you, guys.
O'LEARY:
It's too expensive.
You could buy one of those
for $3,000 more than --
he knows that the franchise
model hasn't worked out yet.
Look, the guy's
a great entrepreneur.
He's just got to go out there
and hustle.
I didn't see anybody write
a check.
We'll be back.
We're still gonna try to fight
childhood obesity,
and we're still gonna grow
Bounce Boot Camp
into a big brand.
So, hey, you win some,
you lose some.
I still feel like we won.
