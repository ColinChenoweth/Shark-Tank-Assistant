My name is Thomas Hill.
Come here, boo.
I live in Anthem, Arizona,
Hello, sharks.
My name is Thomas Hill.
What about the last month,
Thomas?
Is there a trending
month over month?
So, the last month,
in our actual sales,
we've roughly been
about 2,500 bucks.
O'LEARY: Thomas, if I want to
set up mine in Boston,
what does it cost?
The business is $40,000, okay?
Whoa.
It's $40,000.
For us, it's $20,000 is the cost
for all of the equipment,
the trailer.
HERJAVEC: But you haven't sold
any yet, right?
That is correct.
It's an idea.
That is correct.

CUBAN: Thomas,
I love what you're doing,
Thomas, I think your business
model is flawed, okay?
I don't think
this is gonna work.
Might as well get the truth
from me.
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.
I'd love to hear
what you have to say about it.
That's not true.
But here's the problem.
Thomas, I just think
it's a little too soon.
Before you go out,
this is a start-up,
Thomas, you got all
the best advice in the world.
