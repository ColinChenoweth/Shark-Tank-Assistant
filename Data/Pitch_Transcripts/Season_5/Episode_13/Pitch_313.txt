Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim Lewis.
I'm from Chester County,
Pennsylvania,
and my company's name
is the Wall Doctor Rx.
Sharks, I'm asking for $150,000
for 10% equity of my business.
Sharks, I'm a wall-ologist,
a doctor of walls.
And I've created one of the
greatest products in the world,
Wall Rx.
But, look, enough talk.
Let's see what I've got.
First, you need a hole.
[ laughs ]
[ laughs ]
Now, in order to fix that hole,
you need all of this...
And all of this.
Oh, and don't forget this.
Dry as a bone.
Spackle.
Or you simply need this --
wall rx.
Let's see how it works.
First, like any good surgeon,
let us prepare the surface.
Surface prepped.
[ laughter ]
Now, take your disc
and place it over your hole.
Now, take your frame
with your special compound
and place it over the disk.
Press and spread
to desired smoothness.
Done.
In 24 to 48 hours,
it will look like this.
Remove your frame.
Huh.
Wow.
And sand.
Oh, you have to sand it?
No tools, no skills,
and no mess.
Now, who wants to come up
and give it a try?
I want to touch it.
Want to knock a hole
in the wall, Lori,
or you want to just touch it?
Yeah.
I'm gonna do both.
Please do.
Okay.
I would hit it right there.
There you go.
JOHN: There you go.
Okay.
Now, take your disc.
Pull the paper
from your disc.
Okay.
Place it over the hole.
Now take
your special compound.
Okay.
And place it
over the disc.
Press.
Easy.
Done. That's it.
Pretty cool.
Wall doctor,
what happens if the hole
is four inches in diameter?
Oh, Mr. Wonderful,
that's a great --
that's a great question.
You get
the four-inch hole repair.
HERJAVEC:
I've never -- I've never seen
a product like this,
so what's proprietary
about it?
Is it the compound
that you put together?
We have three full patents
on it.
Jim, are you --
are you an engineer?
Are you a chemist?
Are you a doctor?
Oh, no, I'm a real doctor.
I'm a forensic pathologist.
So, Jim, for a living,
you see dead people.
I do.
All right.
So, Jim,
let me ask you something.
Three years ago,
you created this?
Three years ago.
So, what are your sales?
Right now, I've sold a couple.
Uh, we sold 80,000.
Okay.
That's not a couple.
What is your gross sales?
Our gross sales was $600,000.
Oh.
Wow!
Jim, do they have a projection
for next year?
Between a half million
to a million.
Whoa.
But I realize,
you can drown in success.
I've had people come to us
and asking us to put it
in their stores.
Matter of fact, I just met with
the largest retailer on Earth,
and they want it.
And I told 'em,
"I can't do it this year
because I don't have
enough capital."
I've got to automate
my process more,
and if I did it, I would
just take all my inventory.
I would just be -- I would fail.
What does it sell for?
We don't even know.
They're selling
between $6.99 and $9.99.
And what does it cost you
to make?
$2.50 -- $2 to $2.50.
What are you gonna use
the money for?
We're gonna take all the money
and use it for buying machinery
to automate our process.
'cause you're a doctor.
Do you still practice?
I have two full-time jobs.
Wall doctor
and regular doctor.
That's pretty hard to do,
doctor.
I mean, think about it.
If you're gonna grow
this company
and start servicing
the largest retailer on Earth,
either you're gonna do it,
or you're gonna hire
somebody else to do it.
You understand, when you jump
into the big leagues,
you have to build a real company
to support that.
Absolutely.
I'd like to make you
an interesting offer.
I have a lot of connections
internationally in this space,
so I'll give you the $150,000,
no equity.
You can keep
the United States sales.
You give me exclusive rights
for this product,
whatever you sell it for today,
to Lowe's --
let's say
you're selling at $2.
I'll buy it at $2 from you
and sell it
to the rest of the world.
Wow.
Doctor,
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you $150,000
for 15%.
With one contingency.
I want to license
this technology.
I want to give it to a company
that's global,
that has distribution,
manufacturing,
and handles
all the logistics.
You stay being a doctor,
and you get a check every month.
You're on the cusp
of a huge business.
Do you want to be
filthy rich,
or do you want to actually sell
packages of tape?
Which is it?
Oh, I want to be filthy rich
like everyone else.
Ahh,
now you're my kind of guy.
I like Kevin's offer.
My offer's just like Kevin's.
I want to outsource
manufacturing and license it,
except I'm gonna give you
twice the money.
Thank you, Daymond.
Thank you so much.
My offer is $300,000,
twice what you asked for,
for 20% equity.
We will take it
right to QVC,
and right to
an infomercial spot,
because that's where I think
you will make this brand
and this product known globally
with lightning speed.
Whoa.
Whoa, this is, uh...
Wow.
Those are your options.
What is your decision?
NARRATOR: Jim has four offers
on the table.
Robert has offered $150,000
for zero equity,
but he wants
the exclusive rights
to sell the product
internationally.
Kevin has offered $150,000
for 15% of the company,
contingent on
licensing the product
to outsource all manufacturing
and distribution.
Daymond has the same contingency
as Kevin,
but has offered $300,000
for 15%,
and Lori has offered $300,000
but for 20% of the company.
Those are your options.
What is your decision?
Now I know why they call you
sharks and not guppies.
Well, I'm thinking,
I like your deal, Robert,
because the rest of the world
can be taken care of,
and I don't have a problem
with that.
Robert takes a platform
that we all are interested
in taking advantage of, as well.
O'LEARY: When I go to a global
manufacturer, distributor,
logistics company,
they don't want to see
any territory excluded.
GREINER: And when I go to
an infomercial company,
they want to have
all possibilities open to them.
They want to go global.
So Robert's offer is effectively
radioactive waste.
We have not heard
from Mr. Cuban yet.
CUBAN: Daymond says
he's the people's advocate.
I'm the entrepreneur's advocate,
so I'm gonna go out,
and I'm here to answer
any questions, but I'm out.
Okay.
Robert, I want you and Lori
to work together.
Robert,
your deal is phenomenal.
I need you two
to work together.
Doc, I love you, but --
please, please, you got to come
together with this, please.
I just --
I love you, but...
My wife would kill me
if I said no to you,
and my wife would kill me
if I said no to you,
so you've got to come together
with this.
Please --
so, are you saying no
to Kevin and I?
I -- yes.
Don't say
that you're dead to me.
I would love to have you and you
together.
We know you want that.
I want that.
But --
so, now, now,
you guys got to work it out.
You've got to work it out.
Somebody's got to --
I can't do it. it would be
a stupid move for me.
I have in my mind
what I know
will be the successful
marketing structure for you.
I need to bring it
to my infomercial partners,
and they have to have
global rights.
Understood.
Was your counter to give us
some equity into it?
The counter was to get you
two together,
and what do I need to get you
two together?
Doctor, they don't want to work
together.
Robert...
We got a deal.
No, no, no, no.
Now, wait.
Don't change your mind now.
Hang on, my friend.
Oh, Doc!
Hang on, my friend.
What?
Hang on, my friend.
Whoa.
I don't want to be your cousin
at the dance.
My offer didn't change
all the way through,
but you countered that
you only wanted to take my deal
if you got Lori into it.
Honestly, Robert,
are you declining?
Don't -- now, don't --
please don't decline.
Please, please stay in the deal,
please.
Will you take the deal?
[ sighs ]
You know, let's do it.
I'm there. Let's do it.
I'm there, man.
Do I hear a yes?
Yes!
Can I get a "yes"?
Robert,
he said yes before!
All right.
Man, this is great.
Thank you so much.
It was a little confusing there
for a while.
No, no, no.
To nobody but you, Robert.
One other thing,
you are dead to me.
[ laughs ]
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Look,
I think he's very clever.
A lot of entrepreneurs
don't realize,
there's other markets
around the world.
This lets him focus
on what he has.
I don't think
that was clever.
Yeah!
I was trying to do something
to get her in on the deal,
whatever it took
for those two to work together.
That one could have been,
like, Batman and Robin.
We could have had
United States covered
and the rest of the world.
I'm heartbroken,
but my heart was mended
when Robert said,
yes, we had a deal.
NARRATOR: Last season,
three friends from Rhode Island
made a deal with Robert and Mark
for their high-protein
nut Butters, Nuts 'N More.
You guys got a deal.
All right.
[ applause ]
NARRATOR:
Let's see how they're doing now.
Morning, LeAnn.
Since "Shark Tank,"
business has been nuts.
And more.
Prior to "Shark Tank,"
we had $100,000 in sales
in 5 months.
7 months later, we have exceeded
$1 million in sales.
We were doing $2,500 a week.
Now we're doing $2,500 a day.
That's
a lot of peanut butter.
As Rhode Islanders,
we have a great opportunity
to create local jobs.
Manufacturing has been gone
for a long time in this state,
but we're bringing it back.
We've grown
to over 12 employees,
expanded to a 10,000-square foot
state-of-the-art
manufacturing facility,
and have been picked up
by two of the nation's
top supplement distributors.
Mark and Robert
have been fantastic.
They have been great mentors in
helping us build our business.
Robert recently visited us
at the largest fitness
trade show in the country.
Having him there,
showing his support,
was such an unbelievable feeling
for us.
Come on, guys.
We got 230 orders to get done
by the end of the day.
Let's go!
Before "Shark Tank,"
we were only in 32 stores.
Now we're in over 600 stores,
and we just locked in
Whole Foods.
We're looking at being
in over 32,000 stores.
We're projecting $5 million
to $6 million in the next year.
Having the opportunity
to be your own boss
and run your own company
is everything we ever wanted.
"Shark Tank" has really made
our dreams come true.
ALL: Nuts 'N More!
[ cheering ]
NARRATOR:
Next up is an entrepreneur
from Washington, D.C.,
with his answer to a nationwide
security problem.
Hello, sharks.
to Daniel Day-Lewis,
so Daniel Day-Lewis
bought the house next to him.
He dug underneath,
and he sucked his oil well dry.
GREINER: Exactly.
You realize,
I'm a subscriber.
I'm about to sign up
for Groovebook.
I look on Flickr, and I say,
"Oh, I don't need to subscribe.
I can do it one time."
so now you have two sharks,
Kevin and Mark,
who want to give you $150,000
for 80% of
the non-subscription business.
And then you have another offer
with two sharks
who want to give you $375,000
for 50% of your business,
and they help grow
everything with you.
What are you going to do?
Well, I think we've done
an excellent job
growing it ourselves
to 18,000 subscribers
in a short period of time.
I think the better deal...
...Would be to go
with Mark and Mr. Wonderful
because 100%
of growing it ourselves
plus an additional
20% of revenue
that you guys will work at
I think
is a win/win situation.
And I'm all about making
win/win situations.
Do you accept their offer?
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
CUBAN: Let's go to work!
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you. Thank you.
So exciting.
It's very cool.
GREINER: Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Oh, my God!
Wow!
Whoo!
Dang!
They're still in love.
Whoo!
