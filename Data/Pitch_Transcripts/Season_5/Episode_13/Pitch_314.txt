My name is C.J. Isakow
from our nation's capital,
Washington, D.C.
My company is eyebloc,
C.J., you want me
to give you $50,000
for that little piece of crap?
Yeah.
[ laughs ]
let me ask you a question.
how many of you guys
have ever been naked
Wait a minute.
ISAKOW: Have you ever been naked
in front of your computer?
GREINER: Daily.
Yes or no, Mr. Wonderful?
[ laughs ]
So, tell us about the business,
C.J.
We're a new business.
We're very, you know,
rapid growth.
Two months ago,
this thing didn't exist,
How much are you selling it for,
C.J.?
Great question. $9.99.
$9.99?
[ laughs ]
C.J., you know why
it's only been 45 units?
'cause I could take
a piece of gum --
I could take
a post-it note.
You're right.
Yeah, hand 'em out, C.J.,
please.
ISAKOW:
Don't lose those.
I've already sold those
on Amazon.
[ laughs ]
So --
I like this guy.
Here's the thing.
C.J., there's definitely
a market
to protect kids, especially,
from their webcams.
Yeah, absolutely.
I don't think this is it.
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, C.J., Robert is one of
the top ten cybercrime experts
in the world.
If he's not in, there's no way
I'm even gonna think about it.
I'm out.
Okay.
Look, we could make fun.
You're selling fear,
right?
But it's not really
a company.
It's just a product.
I'm out.
Okay.
Mr. Wonderful, I think the other
big opportunity here
is I know you love licensing --
yeah, yeah,
you know, C.J. --
so you could license --
these are going to start to be
built-in --
I'm also a historian.
ISAKOW: These sharks,
they just live in a bubble.
