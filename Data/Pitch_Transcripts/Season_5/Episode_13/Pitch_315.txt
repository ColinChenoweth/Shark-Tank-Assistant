My name is C.J. Isakow
from our nation's capital,
Washington, D.C.
My company is eyebloc,
and I'm seeking $50,000
for 10% of my company,
because, sharks,
Americans are being watched!
They're watching you
with cameras
that are already in your home,
in your office, in your school,
even in your bedroom.
They're watching you
through your computer.
That's right.
People can remotely access
your computer
and watch you
through this camera.
Don't believe me?
Robert,
you're in I.T. security.
You can vouch for this.
Absolutely true.
Absolutely true.
Even the most modest of hackers
can take over your laptop
and control the camera.
For proof,
just turn on the evening news.
There's beauty queens
being blackmailed.
Some creep was taking pictures
of her in her bedroom
in her most private moments
and was blackmailing her.
Even our own government
is overstepping their bounds.
Sharks, I love my country.
I love our freedom!
And this violates
America's very core,
but don't worry.
There's a solution, sharks.
Eyebloc,
the webcam privacy shield.
Designed to fit any device
and cover the camera,
ensuring no one can spy on you.
Let me show you how it works.
Let's say some hacker's gotten
into your computer,
and he's watching you.
It's really sick.
But guess what.
He's watching you,
taking a little too much
interest in your home,
and then...boom!
Eyebloc'd!
Amazing!
Boom goes the dynamite!
Amazing!
You want to see it again?
Did you catch it?
Did we catch it?
Boom!
Oh!
Eyebloc'd!
So, which one of you sharks
is ready to step up,
protect America --
actually, protect the world --
and take a bite
out of cybercrime?
[ laughs ]
Robert,
how big a problem is this?
Yeah, is that true?
Absolutely.
It happens all the time.
It's very difficult
to turn it off
for the average consumer.
C.J., you want me
to give you $50,000
for that little piece of crap?
Yeah.
[ laughs ]
let me ask you a question.
how many of you guys
have ever been naked
in front of your computer,
raise your hand?
Wait a minute.
ISAKOW: Have you ever been naked
in front of your computer?
GREINER: Daily.
Yes or no, Mr. Wonderful?
[ laughs ]
So, tell us about the business,
C.J.
We're a new business.
We're very, you know,
rapid growth.
Two months ago,
this thing didn't exist,
and now I'm getting orders
from people in the military.
I'm getting --
so, how much has
the total orders have been?
45.
Wait, 45 units?
45 --
45,000?
No. Come on.
You said fast-growing company.
So far,
I'm averaging about one a day.
Wow!
It could double to two a day.
Come on.
[ laughs ]
what if it went to three a day?
How much are you selling it for,
C.J.?
Great question. $9.99.
$9.99?
[ laughs ]
Plus $4
shipping and handling.
I'm making 10 bucks.
I've sold over $600 worth
on Amazon.
Wow!
C.J., you know why
it's only been 45 units?
'cause I could take
a piece of gum --
I could take
a post-it note.
You're right.
I could take anything
and just pop it over there.
Mark, you're right.
This is my competition
right here, right here.
Do you want this?
Do you want this
all over your laptop?
You put it on your laptop,
you forget about it.
You're unprotected again.
You know what?
I'm not gonna lose
post-it notes.
There are always
gonna be more.
That thing, I'm gonna lose.
Let me show it to you, Mark.
Let me show you,
'cause it's really high quality.
Yeah, hand 'em out, C.J.,
please.
Red, white, and blue.
I'll go blue.
I'll go white.
Thank you.
ISAKOW:
Don't lose those.
I've already sold those
on Amazon.
[ laughs ]
So --
I like this guy.
Here's the thing.
I invested 5 grand
in an aluminum mold
so I can get them priced down
to $1.25.
A steel mold, and that's part of
what I want the investment for,
will get the price down
to under 25 cents.
So, if you see on the back
is our logo,
and it'll be more prominent
in the mold.
You could use it
as home plate
in your cockroach
baseball league.
[ laughs ]
Cockroach baseball league.
It looks like home plate.
I have a huge problem
with one thing -- the price.
You said you were selling this
for $9.99?
Yeah.
Honestly,
this, to me, a buck.
I'm sorry
to crush your dreams.
Think about car alarms
in the 1980s.
Car alarms in the 1980s,
everyone bought car alarms to
keep people out of their cars.
Everyone's
gonna be buying eyeblocs
to keep them
out of their private lives.
I know, but I think
that they can also think
of a million other ways
to also put a block on.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
C.J., there's definitely
a market
to protect kids, especially,
from their webcams.
Yeah, absolutely.
I don't think this is it.
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, C.J., Robert is one of
the top ten cybercrime experts
in the world.
If he's not in, there's no way
I'm even gonna think about it.
I'm out.
Okay.
Look, we could make fun.
You're selling fear,
right?
But it's not really
a company.
It's just a product.
I'm out.
Okay.
Mr. Wonderful, I think the other
big opportunity here
is I know you love licensing --
yeah, yeah,
you know, C.J. --
so you could license --
these are going to start to be
built-in --
I'm also a historian.
I'm gonna give you a little
story that you're gonna enjoy
and you're gonna learn from.
Okay.
[ laughs ]
Oh, good.
I love his stories.
In the days when there wasn't
any internet,
and we just had cities
and forts and castles...
Yeah.
...The universal
sign of distress
was an upside down flag.
When bad things
were happening,
they'd turn their flag
upside down and hoist it up.
Everybody around them knew,
"whoa, this is bad news.
Something's really bad
in there."
okay.
I think it's time for you
to turn the flag upside down.
[ laughs ]
Oh, man.
I'm out.
All right.
I hope to prove you wrong.
Please keep it for your kids.
Thank you.
Thank you.
See you, bud.
It's an interesting idea,
you know,
'cause you are being watched
all the time,
everywhere you go.
It's pretty sick that we're
being watched all the time.
That is absolute crap
on a stick.
ISAKOW: These sharks,
they just live in a bubble.
I can't believe
they don't understand
that this is a real
privacy issue for real people.
I mean, what's -- what's going
through their head?
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank
is a couple
with an affordable solution
for all those digital photos
stacking up on our smartphones.
Hi, sharks.
