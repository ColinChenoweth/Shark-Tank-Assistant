I am Greg Cronin
from Clinton, Mississippi.
COACHYS: Want you to know
as he's putting that together
that there are no tools that
are needed with this at all.
COACHYS: Actually -- actually,
they might, but they can't.
There's a lot of precision
to this. [ chuckles ]
they can't make that,
Mark.
The reason is, is because
that has been patented.
Oh, so, you're gonna sue
a bunch of 7th graders.
How'd we get involved
in that?
No, we are gonna get 7th graders
to put that in their locker.
They're gonna have it,
no problem.
You know, honestly,
it's just easier to buy it.
Absolutely.
Once you take the two sides,
settle them in,
CRONIN:
That's for the wood version.
Now --
they're fine with that.
It is a contract that's been
exchanged but not executed.
O'LEARY: What? Why?!
We do not have the ability
to fulfill that 10,000
'cause we do not
have the capital
to put the inventory in place
at this time.
Okay, I got it. I'm interested.
They're waiting.
I got it, I got it, got it.
So, go to the next.
All right,
now next to retail.
Staples sells 30%
of school supplies.
We have not
approached them.
What?!
You never called them?
No.
W-- no!
Wait a minute.
No!
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you kidding?
Hold on. Let me --
wait a second.
I let this product stay
in one pilot school
on purpose
for one more year.
So, you didn't want to sell it.
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now hold on.
You have it on Amazon!
You stopped selling.
COACHYS:
No, we don't have it there.
CORCORAN: What happened?
GREINER: Wait.
I have to execute you now.
I let this product stay
in one pilot school
on purpose
for one more year.
So, you didn't want to sell it.
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now hold on.
You have it on Amazon!
You stopped selling.
COACHYS: No, we don't have it
there right now.
CORCORAN: What happened?
GREINER: Wait.
I have to execute you now.
A design patent
is not extremely strong.
How do you know that?
COACHYS: They --
you never called them.
But, Greg, if they don't sell
it, you have to bring it back.
You do.
I got it.
It's a consignment offer.
It's a consignment offer, yeah,
very much.
All right, I love the proof
of concept, but let's be honest.
You're at the very beginning.
We are ready
to go to the world now.
No, I got it.
Correct.
I'm ready to go,
too.
COACHYS: Absolutely.
We want you to come with us.
[ laughter ]
I like to go on a trip.
Which world
are you all going to?
Why is the company
worth $1.75 million?
There are 98,000 schools
in the United States.
110,000.
Okay.
There are approximately
50 million school lockers.
Okay, so, your valuat--
if you take only .05%
of the market --
Greg, your valuation is based on
size of market. got it.
Size of market, .05% of 1%.
Not sure I like that answer,
but let me ask you a second
question -- my final question.
Where does my $175,000
get you to?
Does it get the product
into Staples?
Yeah, no, I don't think
you're on the wrong track, Greg.
CUBAN: You're following
the dream, not the green,
so for that reason, I'm out.
HERJAVEC:
You know what? He is so wrong.
COACHYS: You will have to
buy one, Robert.
Hang on.
I don't want to do this deal
on my own, okay?
Okay. All right.
I think
Lori's interested in it.
Okay.
I'll give you $87,500 --
half the money
you're looking for -- for 25%.
Lori,
if she'd like to do it...
[ laughs ]
...It's up to her.
$87,500
for the other 25%.
Let me be clear before the other
people start making fun of it
Greg, there it is.
That's our offer.
What do you say?
So, what -- where are
your thoughts on the...
I-I think that --
I think that we can work --
with two sharks,
we got more.
We've got double
the contacts.
So, you're gonna be eaten alive
by these guys?
I don't think
we're gonna be eaten alive.
I think eventually,
we'll all eat together.
You got an offer.
What are you gonna do?
I agree.
We will accept the deal.
HERJAVEC: Thank you.
Lori, Robert,
let's do the deal.
Awesome.
All right.
Yeah,
nice job.
Good dad.
Good dad.
Good dad.
We're gonna straighten out
lockers in America.
Yeah,
thank you so much.
Lori,
appreciate it.
