I am Greg Cronin
from Clinton, Mississippi.
And I'm
Dr. Stephen Coachys.
I'm from
Ridgeland, Mississippi.
We are seeking $175,000
for a 10% stake in our company.
Sharks,
that is called disorganitis.
GREINER: [ chuckles ]
There are three symptoms --
lost homework, being late
for class, and falling grades.
But I have found the cure,
and it is lockerbones.
Sharks,
this is a simple product
that eliminates the mess,
reduces the stress.
Lockerbones is the best.
And remember,
an organized student
is a successful student.
So, sharks,
come one, come all,
but join us in improving
the organizational skills
of our future leaders with
the ninth wonder of the world...
BOTH: Lockerbones!
[ chuckles ]
It'll take just a moment,
But I'd like
to take this out,
put it right back,
and you'll see
exactly how it all happens.
that'll be helpful.
Yeah, yeah,
I'd like to see that.
All right.
COACHYS: Want you to know
as he's putting that together
that there are no tools that
are needed with this at all.
30 seconds --
it's in and out.
What does one cost?
Yeah,
but what does it cost?
[ laughing ] Yeah.
A single is $29.95,
and a double, which is normally
the 12-inch, is $39.95.
This might show you
the patented product.
Aren't kids gonna make that
in woodshop?
Not a chance.
[ laughter ]
no, you know what? there's
a lot of cuts in that, Mark.
COACHYS: Actually -- actually,
they might, but they can't.
There's a lot of precision
to this. [ chuckles ]
they can't make that,
Mark.
The reason is, is because
that has been patented.
Oh, so, you're gonna sue
a bunch of 7th graders.
How'd we get involved
in that?
No, we are gonna get 7th graders
to put that in their locker.
They're gonna have it,
no problem.
You know, honestly,
it's just easier to buy it.
Absolutely.
Once you take the two sides,
settle them in,
you take one piece,
and you put it
at any location you want
on that track system.
This becomes
the first vertical divider
in a locker because what happens
is, folders fall over.
They get on top
of each other.
You can't really
keep things standing up.
You slide it in.
You put it in place.
So, nobody else...
You now have vertical ability
to hold the shelves.
And here's a question.
Nobody else,
your competitors...
Right.
...Do not have
a vertical divider?
They do not.
And here comes your nook
and cranny.
You get two of these.
You can put them
anywhere you would like.
You can put reading books.
You can put
your cellphone.
Let me tell you
just briefly how this began.
About four years ago,
my daughter
was going to middle school.
It was
the night before
she needed her locker
organized the next morning.
I went out
to the garage,
took my table saw
out the back porch,
and I created
the first one.
I'm a contractor and
a developer, so I had the tools.
It was,
uh, you know,
rough around the edges
but very functional.
So, she woke up
the next morning, looked at it,
and goes, "Dad,
I'm not taking this to school."
Exactly.
CRONIN: But she knows me,
and we've done this many times.
Kids never appreciate
anything we do for them ever.
No.
Well, the telling sign was,
two girls walk behind us --
first day at a new school --
and they looked, and they said,
"Cool. where'd you get
that wooden one?"
We made
about eight or nine of them
for just close people she
had met that first little bit,
but then the school
organizational director,
the one who goes
and checks the lockers,
contacted me and said,
"This is -- this really works.
It's functional."
and he ordered 500 of them
on the spot.
We got 60 orders.
COACHYS: We have more parents
come to us and say,
"Why didn't we have that
when we were in school?"
how many parents
have you sold them to?
We've sold 500 units.
How long
have you been selling?
Two years
of this particular version.
We are here to request the money
to produce this in plastic.
What's your tooling gonna cost
to do this in plastic?
We paid approximately $28,000
to tool up
for the previous one
on a prior effort...
On a prior one.
It did not work.
...That failed.
You never got distribution.
GREINER: Wait, wait.
Let him -- let him talk.
This was --
this was a prototype, okay?
It's an entrepreneur's thing.
We failed.
That's fine.
CUBAN: Why did it fail?
Yeah, why?
We went in -- because it was --
it did not have
any of this track system.
What we've done is,
two years ago,
we came up
with this design.
We got the design patent
in early July of 2011.
Do you have a utility patent
or just a design?
This is
a design patent.
Just a design.
O'LEARY:
You've had it for four years.
Why isn't it ubiquitous
in distribution?
We've only -- no, we've only
had this for two years.
You've had this --
you've had this for two years,
and you've sold 500 units.
two years is a long time.
Right. This is
one school year last year
was when we introduced
this design, okay?
Did you go into the school
and show it?
We have 500 in this school,
which is 60% penetration.
I am so confused!
Me too. God.
Yeah, I want to --
just let me finish.
O'LEARY:
When you got in front of the --
we're all
still confused.
I want to hear where you're
in front of the Staples buyer
and you say, "Look at
this fantastic locker system,"
and he or she says...
what do they say?
Okay, Kevin...
Yes.
...We have been in front
of a major retailer, okay?
I'm getting excited.
That's one.
They loved the product
in plastic.
They loved
the function.
We have a contract
that has been negotiated,
put in place, okay,
for a 10,000-unit order
from the largest
online retailer
that will fulfill them
themselves
of this product
the way it is.
Right.
Okay?
Who is it?
It is Amazon.
Up to a million,
up to a million.
Okay? This is
for the wood version.
CRONIN:
That's for the wood version.
Now --
they're fine with that.
It is a contract that's been
exchanged but not executed.
O'LEARY: What? Why?!
We do not have the ability
to fulfill that 10,000
'cause we do not
have the capital
to put the inventory in place
at this time.
Okay, I got it. I'm interested.
They're waiting.
I got it, I got it, got it.
So, go to the next.
All right,
now next to retail.
Staples sells 30%
of school supplies.
We have not
approached them.
What?!
You never called them?
No.
W-- no!
Wait a minute.
No!
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you kidding?
Hold on. Let me --
wait a second.
I let this product stay
in one pilot school
on purpose
for one more year.
So, you didn't want to sell it.
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now hold on.
You have it on Amazon!
You stopped selling.
COACHYS:
No, we don't have it there.
CORCORAN: What happened?
GREINER: Wait.
I have to execute you now.
I let this product stay
in one pilot school
on purpose
for one more year.
So, you didn't want to sell it.
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Now hold on.
You have it on Amazon!
You stopped selling.
COACHYS: No, we don't have it
there right now.
CORCORAN: What happened?
GREINER: Wait.
I have to execute you now.
A design patent
is not extremely strong.
Until you can go quick
and fast in this market --
they can buy one at Amazon
and knock it out.
You need to make it
out of plastic.
No, he doesn't.
And you need
to bring the price down.
Yes, he does.
Wood is too expensive.
CRONIN:
Yes, we do, and that's what --
he's got to change the color,
as well.
That's what Staples
and office depot want.
They --
how do you know that?
Office Depot
wants it.
How do you know that?
COACHYS: They --
you never called them.
And there's another
large retailer.
All they want
is it in plastic and color.
I really want
to nail this down...
Sure.
...Because this matters a lot.
Certainly, absolutely.
Amazon's going to buy
from you,
and they are saying,
"I am going to buy up front.
Here's a pledge."
how much?
10,000 units,
up to a million units.
We ship to them.
They warehouse it.
They sell it.
They have terms.
They pay us later.
This is not a P.O.
from a traditional retailer.
But, Greg, if they don't sell
it, you have to bring it back.
You do.
I got it.
It's a consignment offer.
It's a consignment offer, yeah,
very much.
All right, I love the proof
of concept, but let's be honest.
You're at the very beginning.
We are ready
to go to the world now.
No, I got it.
Correct.
I'm ready to go,
too.
COACHYS: Absolutely.
We want you to come with us.
[ laughter ]
I like to go on a trip.
Which world
are you all going to?
Why is the company
worth $1.75 million?
There are 98,000 schools
in the United States.
110,000.
Okay.
There are approximately
50 million school lockers.
Okay, so, your valuat--
if you take only .05%
of the market --
Greg, your valuation is based on
size of market. got it.
Size of market, .05% of 1%.
Not sure I like that answer,
but let me ask you a second
question -- my final question.
Where does my $175,000
get you to?
Does it get the product
into Staples?
Yes.
I'm gonna tell you yes,
and this is how.
One,
tooling gets done.
Okay.
Two, initial inventory is what
we'll be using the money for.
To fill purchase orders
or just to build inventory?
Well, he doesn't have
the orders.
He has to go out --
we're gonna go execute the order
we have on the table
with the confidence
we can fulfill it.
CUBAN: I'm gonna simplify it
here, guys.
Where you've killed it...
Is selling it in schools,
where it catches fire.
It's viral.
The kids love it.
But no discussion whatsoever
of selling it in the same manner
to the 110,000 schools.
All you have to do is go to the
middle school down the street
and wait for the orders and
then just go to one more school,
kill it again.
Go to one more school, not this
big consignment order to Amazon
where you could take
all your inventory.
It could all be sent back
if it doesn't sell through.
Respectfully -- respectfully,
we were not finished...
You know what, Mark?
There's nothing wrong
with what they did.
...With the response
to him,
and I know I didn't
give it quick enough
till we got an answer.
Yeah, no, I don't think
you're on the wrong track, Greg.
CUBAN: You're following
the dream, not the green,
so for that reason, I'm out.
HERJAVEC:
You know what? He is so wrong.
Robert and I don't agree
with that at all.
O'LEARY: Well, wait a second.
Wait a second.
Hear me on this -- New York,
Florida, Texas, California.
That's where
all the schools are, okay?
What you want to do
is sell 10% of the lockers
in those four states,
and you'll be filthy rich!
Great product,
but you didn't talk about
a distribution strategy
for just getting to the schools.
I'm out.
What I think you're doing here
is nuts!
I think you could get every kid
in every school
to be peddling for you,
and they're easy to recruit
'cause they're not looking
for a lot of money.
You're missing
the best opportunity.
I'm out.
Three sharks out,
two still in.
Let me -- let me tell you
where I'm at
'cause I-I think I've heard
enough to make a decision.
The idea of selling on Amazon
on consignment...
It's nuts!
Staples has 30% of the market.
To me, the path is very simple.
Get it to Staples.
I like the product.
It's probably the best product
I've seen for this application.
COACHYS: You will have to
buy one, Robert.
Hang on.
I don't want to do this deal
on my own, okay?
Okay. All right.
I think
Lori's interested in it.
Okay.
I'll give you $87,500 --
half the money
you're looking for -- for 25%.
Lori,
if she'd like to do it...
[ laughs ]
...It's up to her.
$87,500
for the other 25%.
Let me be clear before the other
people start making fun of it
'cause I'm the only guy who
made an offer and Lori maybe.
We are
at the beginning.
Right.
It's not like you guys came here
with $10,000 of real orders.
It's not like you came here
with a million-dollar company
and I'm trying to
take advantage of you for 50%.
It's a start-up.
There's four of us.
We each own 25%.
That's my offer.
I don't know where Lori is.
I like it.
I'm in with you.
Greg, there it is.
That's our offer.
What do you say?
So, what -- where are
your thoughts on the...
I-I think that --
I think that we can work --
with two sharks,
we got more.
We've got double
the contacts.
So, you're gonna be eaten alive
by these guys?
I don't think
we're gonna be eaten alive.
I think eventually,
we'll all eat together.
You got an offer.
What are you gonna do?
I agree.
We will accept the deal.
HERJAVEC: Thank you.
Lori, Robert,
let's do the deal.
Awesome.
All right.
Yeah,
nice job.
Good dad.
Good dad.
Good dad.
We're gonna straighten out
lockers in America.
Yeah,
thank you so much.
Lori,
appreciate it.
I think it's a huge problem,
and that's a great solution.
HERJAVEC:
It's a great product.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, guys.
Good luck, guys.
Congratulations.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Well, it was a little bit more
than we wanted to give,
but we got a deal
with two sharks!
Boom!
Yay!
Boom!
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur
with a way
to ease the difficulty
of dining out with kids.
