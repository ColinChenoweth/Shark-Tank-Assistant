BARZMAN:
Hi, sharks.
My name
is Mike Barzman.
And I'm
Bryan O'Connell.
And we're co-founders
of invisiplug.
We're looking for $125,000
for 10% of our company.
So, how many of you guys
own one of these?
Just one of the basic,
ugly power strips
that's a complete eyesore,
right?
We've done something
a little different.
Introducing invisiplug.
Invisiplug is the first line
of surge protectors
designed to seamlessly blend in
to hardwood floors.
Now, it's available
in three colors --
light natural,
medium cherry, and dark oak,
so it covers a wide variety
of hardwood flooring.
We just
launched the product,
and the response
has been overwhelming.
So, let me ask you guys
a question.
Who wants to get
into the power business?
[ chuckles ]
BARZMAN: Bryan, show them what
everyone's been talking about.
Let me show you guys.
So, sharks,
we need your investments,
we need
your expertise...
Thank you,
Bryan, thank you.
...And we need
your relationships
to help us as
we take this product to market.
So, there are
some very big players
making extension cords
that already have distribution.
Sure.
What is to stop them
from simply dyeing theirs
and crushing you
like the extension-cord
cockroaches you are?
We have
a design patent
that we actually received
on the process,
so we're proprietary
with the wood-grain printing.
So it's the look of the product
that's protected.
Exactly, exactly.
Somebody could make one
that looks like it
using a different process,
and the whole patent thing
doesn't matter.
O'LEARY:
So this isn't protectable,
so then it goes back
to my original question.
The guys that own this space
that make hundreds of millions
of these things
around the world,
what's to stop them
from absolutely decimating
this business if it ever
takes off in the first place?
Well --
CUBAN: Because it's niche.
There's no reason for them to.
You mean it's never gonna be
a big business?
Exactly, but the --
it's not gonna be exciting
to invest in.
question -- what are --
what are do you sell these for?
I'll never make any money.
is that what you're saying?
Our retail price is $14.99.
I didn't know
if you were gonna go --
try to go high end so that
if you worked with designers
and this was $249
because it was the only way
to get the perfect look
on your floor,
then I can see it, right?
If it's a $14.99 product,
it's gonna be perceived
as being inexpensive.
It's not really gonna
be perceived as a
solution in my mind.
I don't think
it's a real business.
I'm out.
I like the idea
that it's a $14.99 product
and anybody could afford it,
but might I ask you,
what do you pay
for a standard white one?
$6 to $12.
HERJAVEC: Bryan, how long
have you been selling it?
6 1/2 weeks.
The total amount
of units sold
is just under 1,500 units
as of right now.
What's the total sales
for that?
The total gross sales
is over $10,000,
and the total net
is just about $6,000.
We're doing
a special design two pack,
an exclusive product
for costco right now.
They give us a purchase order
for around 3,000 units.
If they do $500
of gross sales per week,
they will order a starting order
of 120,000 two packs
with a margin
that's about 78%.
So, I'm a computer guy.
I buy a lot of these.
I'm not sure
I see the market for it.
I think most people
that buy these things
put them behind a desk if
they don't like the look of them
to try to hide them somewhere
'cause even with yours,
even though
it's better-looking...
O'CONNELL: Mm-hmm.
...I still see the cord.
I still see the thing
on the floor.
It blends in better,
but it's still not
aesthetically pleasing to me.
For that reason, I'm out.
So, we have to pay you
$1.25 million valuation.
I think
you're gonna sell some maybe,
and if you do, good for you, but
it's not an investable business.
And the price you've asked
in terms of the value is --
is beyond insane.
Well, and I --
this is one of the classic
situations in "Shark Tank"
where you come in thinking
because you've lived
too close to it
that it's worth
a million dollars -- $1 million.
Don't ask a million bucks
for something
that hasn't made any money yet.
Sure.
What, are you guys nuts?!
Come on!
Sure. Out of all respect,
we have -- we have a budding
business that we believe --
don't give him
any respect yet.
and we respect your criticism
and your success,
and we have -- there's not --
and I appreciate your --
your thoughts.
Listen, on this planet,
it's not worth a million bucks.
On any other planet, it's not
worth a million bucks, okay?
Sure it is.
I'm out.
I'm the perfect customer
for this product
'cause my husband, Bill,
probably buys
six of these a week,
and I hate every one of them.
[ laughter ]
Okay.
He goes on a business trip.
I throw them out.
He comes home.
He buys new ones.
They're ugly.
That's hilarious.
All right, I would like to buy
at least three dozen from you.
That's fantastic.
But your [sighs] the number
you put on this business
Is nuts for a crapshoot.
Basically, it's a crapshoot.
I think you're gonna sell a lot,
but why
would I give you $125,000
for any percentage
to find out?
So, I wish you luck,
but I treasure my money
more than that.
I'm out.
Lori,
are there any questions?
[ chuckles ]
How much money
have you put into this?
We have around $70,000
into the company to date.
T-the real reason
we want the money
is because of the o mag article
that's coming out.
O as in
Oprah magazine?
Yeah. Yes, yes,
Oprah magazine.
Wow.
Oprah magazine
is featuring this.
As a new pro--
in their new-products section.
O'CONNELL: Yeah, yeah.
Okay, you will sell out.
I hope so.
God willing,
a-a-and that's
what we are kind of basing
a lot of our belief on,
you know,
with our product,
and the response
has been nothing but positive
from all these big-box people,
you know?
Impressive activity.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I'll give you the $125,000
for 10%,
but I want a dollar
per unit sold...
Until I make back my $125,000.
Mm-hmm.
And then I want 50 cents
forever thereafter.
Now, did you say
in perpetuity?
Yes.
Yes, yes.
CUBAN:
She said forever.
Yes, what it is,
is I want protection.
That's a Kevin deal.
O'LEARY: That's right.
That is a Kevin deal.
CORCORAN: No, if it's insulting,
it's a Kevin deal.
No, no, never.
Kevin never insults.
[ laughs ]
O'LEARY: You want protection.
You need surge protection.
Because I don't --
I need surge protection.
I need investment protection.
Absolutely.
Because you have a lot
of fish on the hook.
Thank you.
But I'm not sure.
You don't have proven sales.
Sure.
So it's as big a gamble for me
as it is for you.
So that's why I'm structuring
the deal this way.
Well, absolutely,
and you can understand
that for a company
in our infancy,
it's so hard to put
a real valuation on our company.
If we pull the trigger
on that costco order,
that's over a million dollars
in net profit,
and that's
just one order.
Tell me if this
is too much of a counter
along the lines
of 25 cents per unit
until you recoup
your investment
and then a possible 5-
or a 10-cent --
possibly, and I'd have to call
our advisor -- royalty.
So, here's going to be
my final offer.
$125,000.
I do want the dollar per unit
until I make back my $125,000,
but then I'll go to 25 cents
in perpetuity
off of each unit sold.
10% equity.
I understand it's a steep deal,
but it's what it will take
to get me in.
A-are you at all willing
to negotiate on the perpetuity?
I'm not.
Not at all?
I'm not.
You're nice guys, but it's what
I feel I need to make the deal.
Okay, guys, you got her to go
down from 50 cents in perpetuity
down to a quarter.
I don't think
it's an unreasonable offer,
to be honest with you...
no.
Sure, sure.
...Where you are today.
HERJAVEC: You know what?
The more you're talking...
Mm-hmm.
...The more impressed
I've been getting up here.
Oh, thank you.
Are you going to make an offer?
Coming back in?
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.
Mike and Bryan
have an offer from Lori,
but Robert may come back in.
HERJAVEC: You know what?
The more you're talking...
Mm-hmm.
...The more impressed
I've been getting up here.
O'CONNELL: Oh, thank you.
Are you going to make an offer?
Coming back in?
Yeah, I'll make you an offer.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I don't think
that the business
can afford the royalty
right now,
and I think you're willing
to give up a little more equity.
I'll give you the $125,000
for 25% straight in, no royalty,
and we're in this together.
"Boom"
goes the dynamite!
O'LEARY: Wow!
Hey, and I got to tell you,
you --
Robert,
thank you for that offer.
You convinced me.
Are you at all negotiable
on what you gave us?
Would you consider
coming down to 20%?
I'll do the 20%
if you do the deal right now.
Interesting.
$125,000, 20%.
Let's do it.
Can we still go back
and make a phone call?
Oh, man!
No.
What did I just say?
He just said
this was the deal right now.
What do you want
to do?
Um...
3...
2...
1...
[ murmurs ]
yeah.
We -- we'd like
to step back,
a-and we understand
that you're out.
[ all groaning ]
I'm out.
Whoa!
I think you're down
to one offer.
So,
to recap then,
you're offering $125,000
for 10%, plus...
Dollar per unit...
...Dollar per unit till --
...until I recover.
and then 25 cents...
And then 25 cents
per unit...
...In perpetuity.
...In perpetuity.
Is there any room
on the royalty portion,
even, say, 5 cents
just to show a good faith
that you really believe
in what we're doing?
You'll walk away
with the 20 cents.
You'll get
the dollar back.
You'll have your equity.
And because of who you are
and your partnerships,
we would love
to take that deal,
and we think
that we could really do well
with you
in the future.
You guys, I really -- I respect
everything you've done,
but I did say that
that was my final offer.
Okay.
And so it is --
then we'd like
to take it.
Okay.
You've got a deal, Lori.
CUBAN: Congrats, guys.
Nice.
[ laughter ]
[ whistling ]
We're gonna sell
a lot of plugs.
It's a pleasure
to be in business.
I hope so. I hope so.
[ laughs ]
how about a hug?
[ laughter ]
thank you, Lori.
okay.
Cool.
We look forward to it.
CUBAN: Congrats, guys.
We'll talk soon.
CORCORAN: Ciao.
Good to see you guys.
Thank you so much.
We got Lori. Whoo!
That was great.
Well, you got yourself
a good deal.
That's a great deal
for you.
It's not even that bad for them.
And I'll support them totally.
It's not even that bad
for them.
Good business
is always good business.
We got
what we wanted.
It's awesome.
You know,
we gave up a little,
tiny bit more,
but we did it.
Yeah, that's really good.
[ laughs ]
NARRATOR: Last season,
Corey Ward and Trew Quackenbush
impressed the sharks and closed
a deal with Barbara Corcoran
for their grilled-cheese
restaurant franchise Tom+Chee.
I'd say
we take the deal.
HERJAVEC: Yes, sir!
All right.
Thank you, guys, so much.
Awesome.
Let's see
what they're up to now.
[ sizzling ]
Oh, it's a great-looking
sandwich, gentlemen.
Since being on "Shark Tank,"
our sales have been insane.
WARD:
Before "Shark Tank,"
it took us a year to reach
a million dollars in sales,
and in three months
since the show,
we've already
gone over a million dollars.
What can I
get you today?
WARD:
Before "Shark Tank,"
we only had 40 employees
in 3 locations.
Since the show's aired,
we're up to 80 employees
across six locations
and our corporate offices.
That's 100% job creation
in just 3 months.
Well, I want to welcome
everybody to the family.
Today,
we're closing deals
with our first three franchisees
since "Shark Tank."
we're gonna now have tom+chee
in New Jersey, Tennessee,
and Kentucky.
Hello, everybody.
ALL:
Hey, Barbara!
I'm so happy to be with you,
and I'm so excited
to meet your first franchisees.
Working with Barbara
has been great.
She's understood our business
model from the very beginning,
and she's made herself
available to us
whether it's through
e-mails, video chats.
She's there
to answer our questions,
and we do have
a lot of them.
I would like a Barbara blue,
please.
Just like we promised
on "Shark Tank,"
the shark
that invested in tom+chee
would get a sandwich
on the board,
and Barbara did,
so she got the Barbara blue --
smoked ham, Brie cheese,
blueberry compote
all on a yeast-glazed donut.
it's amazing.
[ laughs ]
Our "Shark Tank"
experience
has been a roller coaster
of emotion.
To think that we started
in a street tent
and now what the future
holds for us just blows us away.
ALL:
Thank you, "Shark Tank"!
[ all cheering ]
NARRATOR: Next up are two dads
who've created a product
designed to keep students
organized.
Hello, sharks.
