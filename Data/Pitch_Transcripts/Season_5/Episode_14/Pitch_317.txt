Hello, sharks.
I'm Ben Alexander.
I'm from sunny Tampa, Florida.
What were your sales
last year, Ben?
The sales
were actually a little higher.
They were actually $650,000.
GREINER:
Wow, big drop.
So, why are sales
going down?
I recruited a lot of magicians
Oh, no, Ben, you got to focus.
You got to focus.
Okay.
Tell us the structure.
The regional partner sells
restaurants, trains people,
ALEXANDER: Okay.
It doesn't really sound like
you need the cash.
I want to franchise.
I do, because I want
to franchise this idea.
Oh, man,
you're gonna drive me crazy.
HERJAVEC:
You don't need a franchise.
You need
to build an infrastructure.
You need people
to manage.
I need a strategic partner who
can give me a little guidance.
If you think
that franchising is a bad idea
okay, Ben,
Ben, Ben --
Ben, you -- you got to --
you know what?
You're a great salesman,
but you didn't show me
