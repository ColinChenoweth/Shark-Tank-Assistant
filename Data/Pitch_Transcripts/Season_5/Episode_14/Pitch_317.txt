Hello, sharks.
I'm Ben Alexander.
I'm from sunny Tampa, Florida.
And I'm asking you for $250,000
for 30% of my wild company.
Whoo!
Have you ever
gone to a restaurant
and you order your food
and there's nothing
the restaurant can do
to make the food
come out faster?
You might be impatient,
but you know how it is
when you have kids.
Oh, my gosh. They're swinging
from the chandeliers.
They're running under the table,
over the table.
It's crazy!
Well, that's why restaurants
turn to me
and my very unique,
very different,
very unexpected company
that uses creativity...
HERJAVEC: Oh, wow!
...To put balloons
in restaurants!
I am balloon distractions!
[ all cheering ]
Happy day!
Stop the madness!
[ laughter ]
We are the nation's
premier talent agency
for balloon artists
that we send
into national
brand restaurants.
We are the first company
to ever take this
and put this
all over the United States.
We made something special
for each of you.
Oh, wow!
GREINER: [ chuckles ] Yay.
Mr. Herjavec,
I know you love motorcycles.
I do.
So I made you
a very cool motorcycle.
Oh.
Oh, how cute!
Very cool!
Lori, I know that -- I know
that you are the absolute,
most awesome QVC shark.
You look
so much better now.
[ laughter ]
And -- and, Mr. Wonderful,
I actually made you
a Chiquita banana...
CORCORAN:
Oh, my God.
...Fruit hat.
Doesn't he look beautiful,
sharks?
Now, Barbara, you are the queen
of building sales organizations.
I've always wanted
to be a queen. Thank you.
[ laughter ]
You are.
And last but certainly
not least, Mr. Cuban...
Thank you.
...I'm a big fan
of the Mavericks,
and I made you a Dallas Mavs...
I like it.
...Basketball player.
I would love
for you to join me.
I will...
[ laughter ]
[ laughs ]
I'm an emotional guy.
Don't start crying yet!
Oh, my God.
You haven't even
started asking me.
Wait till
we say something.
I would love
to have you guys come in
and help me blow this up.
[ sighs ]
Thank you.
[ sighs ]
[ laughter ]
whoo!
Exhausting.
Oh, my God.
I-I need to ask
the most important question.
Yes.
Are you like this all the time?
I just wanted
to come out here
and share the joy that I have
in my heart about this.
I'm very worried you're going
to spontaneously combust.
[ laughter ]
No kidding.
Let's talk numbers,
or I'm taking out my penknife.
Okay, fair enough.
[ laughs ]
we do over $500,000 a year
in sales.
Okay.
I've done $4 million
since inception.
Wow.
What were your sales
last year, Ben?
The sales
were actually a little higher.
They were actually $650,000.
GREINER:
Wow, big drop.
So, why are sales
going down?
I recruited a lot of magicians
when the economy was really slow
and they were hurting.
And then the economy got faster,
and they started
getting more bookings.
I couldn't find people
to run regions,
and then what happened --
I had the clown community
criticize me online.
The clown community?
I'm not joking.
Those nasty clowns!
[ laughter ]
like, what --
what were they saying?
Oh, just, like, "Your business
model, it's terrible."
I'm the Sam Walton
of balloons.
You don't want to piss off
the clown community!
[ laughs ]
What business are you in?
You haven't
really told us.
Okay, restaurants pay us a fee
to have a balloon artist come in
and do balloons after --
distract the guests
on a regular basis.
You're a booking agency.
Yes, we are.
Okay,
so you book "talent."
Mm-hmm.
And they go out
to restaurants.
Yes. Let me explain
so you understand.
I really want
to build something
so that I can find
regional partners.
I've been putting out ads
and spending money,
and I have regional partners
who get started and go to this
and --
and don't pull the trigger.
I say to the regional partner,
"I'm gonna give you a percentage
"of the revenue
from the restaurants.
"you have to train people.
"they already know
the balloons
'cause you have to know
the basics."
As a matter of fact,
I go out and do balloons
in restaurants myself.
Oh, no, Ben, you got to focus.
You got to focus.
Okay.
Tell us the structure.
The regional partner sells
restaurants, trains people,
and watches
the schedule weekly,
so they're really
like a regional manager.
And how much
do you charge the restaurant?
I charge $40 to $60 a night.
What does the balloon artist
charge the kids per balloon?
Can I have her
answer this question?
She's a real balloon artist.
Sure, okay.
This is Josanna.
What we do is,
we have a tip button
that says we twist for tips,
and what we do
as a "subtle hint" is,
we stick a $5 bill in there.
So, what are you gonna use
the money for?
ALEXANDER: Okay.
It doesn't really sound like
you need the cash.
I want to franchise.
I do, because I want
to franchise this idea.
Oh, man,
you're gonna drive me crazy.
HERJAVEC:
You don't need a franchise.
You need
to build an infrastructure.
You need people
to manage.
I need a strategic partner who
can give me a little guidance.
If you think
that franchising is a bad idea
and you're an investor --
it's a real bad idea.
I'm teachable, guys. If this
is a sales organization --
but you're asking me
to give you $250,000,
and you don't have a plan
for world domination
of balloon twisters.
If I don't franchise,
I want to bring on
a full-time recruiter...
Right.
...Who understands this.
That's what I need.
Ding, ding,
ding, ding!
Operations and recruiting.
I can sell
20 restaurants a day.
You -- every region I visited
this summer, 17,000 --
okay, Ben,
Ben, Ben --
Ben, you -- you got to --
you know what?
You're a great salesman,
but you didn't show me
how I can give you $250,000
and get a great return.
I'm out.
Okay.
Miss Corcoran...
CORCORAN: Yes?
...You've built
sales organizations.
You want to know
what this is?
This is exactly like
building a real-estate business
with multiple offices --
no different.
Yeah.
So I really understand
your business.
I know you do.
Your whole organization
is reliant
on the right salesperson
in each region.
That's the key
to this business.
It's not
your ability to sell.
It's your ability
to recruit salespeople.
You've not succeeded
in doing that,
and that's
an Achilles' heel.
In your business,
that's gonna murder you.
[ sighs ]
You're a phenomenal salesman.
But you're not
a sales manager.
I would be so scared putting
my money in your business.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
GREINER: I'm gonna tell you
what I think.
It is
an adorable idea,
but I have sales reps
that work under me,
and one
of the most important things is,
is that they're very focused
and organized.
And here,
I had so much trouble
understanding the business plan
and model
that I think it would be
very difficult for me
to invest
and give you my money.
I understand.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Mr. Cuban?
Your -- your business
is structured wrong,
but that's
the bad news.
The good news is,
if you get it together
and you get your sales
up over a million dollars,
this is an easily
sellable business...
yes.
...Particularly someone who's
already got offices in place.
We have fixed costs.
And you could sell it
for millions.
If we can get this to one --
shut up!
Whoa.
My suggestion is,
instead of
using regional managers
and regional partners
on a commission basis,
you go find the best
recent college graduate
management talent
that you can find.
Put them on a salary.
I got you.
Yeah, put them on a salary.
It doesn't have to be
a lot.
Give them some commission,
give them draw,
whatever it may be.
okay.
But develop
management talent.
You're not ready
for me yet.
I'd go crazy, and for
those two reasons, I'm out.
O'LEARY:
I like your business,
but you're missing the partner
that does the operations.
Had they been here
sitting beside you --
that ghost,
that clown, whatever it was --
I would've probably
done your -- your deal.
I like it
'cause it's so unique,
and I know how to sell this
business in a couple of years.
The riches are in the niches,
sharks, and you know what?
We already have --
we already have --
you got to listen!
O'LEARY: But the point is,
you -- you --
you can't get $250,000
from anybody in here,
not the way you're structured
right now.
Instead of leaving
with a heavy heart
and a crying clown,
you should say,
"I'm gonna take that advice
and run with it."
But today, I'm out.
Thank you very much, sharks.
CUBAN: Thank you.
Thank you for the balloon.
GREINER:
Thank you for our hats.
[ balloons popping ]
Oh, don't do that!
Oh, you're so mean!
Don't pop 'em!
Don't do that!
Kevin!
[ laughs ]
Oh!
