PADAWER:
My name is Lauren Padawer,
I live in Cordova, Alaska,
Hi.
This is Lauren.
Starting a business in Alaska
is challenging
because we're so far
from everywhere else.
Getting to meetings or just
paying for a plane ticket
poses some real challenges.
Alaska Glacial Mud Company
is treading water.
I need an investment
from the sharks
to take my company
to the next level.
I want everyone everywhere
My name is Lauren Padawer.
I live in Cordova, Alaska,
where I am both the founder
Lauren, can we see it?
Absolutely.
For you.
Thank you.
There's a mixture here
of some of
the different products we carry.
Thank you.
Thank you,
Lauren.
Mr. Wonderful.
CORCORAN: Thank you.
Barbara.
Very nice of you.
Mark.
O'LEARY: Have you processed
this mud in any way?
It goes
through a refining process
to ensure quality control.
The mud is --
'cause I-I'm worried
that a big bear
would've taken a large dump
near where you were.
[ laughter ]
Oh, God.
It's the cleanest mud
in the world,
PADAWER: The copper river
where this comes from
Do you have a small shop,
Lauren, that you sell it in?
No,
I do not have a retail shop.
We wholesale it to spas.
In Alaska?
We wholesale it
all over the world.
Your real target
that you most want are the spas?
Yes,
I'm interested in the spas,
but there is a lot of products
on the market
that people buy
for themselves at home,
I mean, especially
in more depressed economies,
people who can't afford
to go to a spa.
What does that jar sell
for retail?
It sells for $34.
How much money have you
put into it, Lauren?
I've put $50,000
into the business.
Where did you get
that money?
That's from money that
I have saved over the years.
Fishing is where
I do make my income.
The fishing is only three months
out of the year.
Scary, isn't it, when you put up
everything you have?
How much money do you make
on the fishing side?
I gross a little over
$100,000 a year.
Wow.
Well, good for you.
You bring in
$100,000 a year?
Yes.
That's incredible.
That's amazing.
I want to buy
into your fish business.
Do you fish alone?
I fish alone.
Wow!
Really?
You're a beast.
Congratulations.
I-I am a risk taker.
It's largely a man's world.
There are seven woman who
professionally commercial-fish
in the town that I'm in,
but this is something
that I really felt I could do,
I honestly --
Lauren,
one of the biggest challenges
is making the decision when
to grow something organically,
just grind it out,
or to spend a lot of money
HERJAVEC: So, Lauren, your mud
may actually be better,
but the consumer walking
into the spa doesn't know that.
That's why I'm here.
But --
I need your help.
I mean, I have been working
really hard to make this happen.
I mean --
oh, I hear you,
but you could spend millions
to educate a market.
You can't go global when
you're doing $36,000 a year.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you, Robert.
You've got a lot of good things
going for you.
Thank you, Barbara.
CUBAN: Well, Lauren,
you've got --
I have Mr. mud face left.
[ laughter ]
Kevin has never
looked better.
O'LEARY:
My other problem with it
that none of the other sharks
picked up on
but anybody can go pick up mud
out of the copper river.
"Get out of the way,
Lauren.
That's my mud pile."
they're gonna squash me
like a bug.
No, no.
[ laughter ]
they've already done that.
O'LEARY: Tell me
if this is not the truth.
You're taking
a successful business --
your fishing business --
Okay, okay, look, look, look.
Look, Lauren --
Thanks, Lauren.
Thank you.
Really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Ciao.
Good luck.
Ciao.
