PADAWER:
My name is Lauren Padawer,
I live in Cordova, Alaska,
and I'm the founder
of Alaska Glacial Mud Company.
Besides running my company,
I work as
a commercial salmon fisherman.
Being a salmon fisherman,
you have to love
being out on the water,
and you have to love
taking risks.
It's not so different
than being an entrepreneur
and being able
to stick your neck out there
to do something you love.
[ kettle whistling ]
Hi.
This is Lauren.
Starting a business in Alaska
is challenging
because we're so far
from everywhere else.
Getting to meetings or just
paying for a plane ticket
poses some real challenges.
Alaska Glacial Mud Company
is treading water.
I need an investment
from the sharks
to take my company
to the next level.
I want everyone everywhere
to experience a little bit of
the purity and beauty of Alaska.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Lauren Padawer.
I live in Cordova, Alaska,
where I am both the founder
and owner
of Alaska Glacial Mud Company.
I'm here today seeking $100,000
in exchange for 20%
of Alaska Glacial Mud Company.
As a commercial fisherman,
I know Alaska is already famous
for wild salmon,
but someday,
I'd like to see us famous
for a luxurious
and nutrient-rich
Alaska glacial mud.
The idea
for Alaska Glacial Mud Company
started
on a wilderness rafting trip
down the majestic copper river.
As soon as I stepped in,
my feet sank into buttery mud.
It was such a divine sensation,
I proceeded to cover my face
and body in the silky mud
at the most wild spa
in the world.
After washing it off,
my skin was soft and glowing.
I want to see this amazing mud
become an industry standard
in the spa market.
So, sharks, who wants
to get their fins dirty
and play in the mud with me?
GREINER: [ chuckling ]
Mm.
Are you the only one
that ever discovered
that this was the best mud
in the world?
There is no other Alaska glacial
mud products on the market.
Lauren, can we see it?
Absolutely.
For you.
Thank you.
There's a mixture here
of some of
the different products we carry.
Thank you.
Thank you,
Lauren.
Mr. Wonderful.
CORCORAN: Thank you.
Barbara.
Very nice of you.
Mark.
O'LEARY: Have you processed
this mud in any way?
It goes
through a refining process
to ensure quality control.
The mud is --
'cause I-I'm worried
that a big bear
would've taken a large dump
near where you were.
[ laughter ]
Oh, God.
It's the cleanest mud
in the world,
and it comes from
one of the most pristine
wild rivers in the world.
I would actually really like to
have Mr. Wonderful come up here
and give you a glacial facial.
Whoa!
Okay, then.
I just hope I'm not
being covered in bear poo.
[ laughs ]
Oh, God.
No,
this is very pure.
GREINER: How long
would you need to leave it?
In order to dry,
it would take
about 10 to 15 minutes.
Does it draw the impurities
up out of your skin?
Absolutely.
It contains
microfine clay particles
that absorb toxins
and exfoliate dead skin.
Somehow this looks like
the true you.
CUBAN: All you got to do
is draw some horns on him,
and he's set.
[ laughter ]
what other body parts
can be used with this stuff?
Top of his head.
[ laughter ]
CUBAN: The color of money.
the color of money.
O'LEARY:
It's very cooling.
I feel the toxins
leaving my body.
PADAWER: The copper river
where this comes from
is an incredibly pure
and wild place
as you all may know if you're
fans of copper river salmon.
How much are you selling today,
and how are you selling it?
Our sales to date
are $36,000 a year.
Ooh.
$36,000 a year.
Do you have a small shop,
Lauren, that you sell it in?
No,
I do not have a retail shop.
We wholesale it to spas.
In Alaska?
We wholesale it
all over the world.
Your real target
that you most want are the spas?
Yes,
I'm interested in the spas,
but there is a lot of products
on the market
that people buy
for themselves at home,
I mean, especially
in more depressed economies,
people who can't afford
to go to a spa.
What does that jar sell
for retail?
It sells for $34.
And what does it cost
to make one jar?
About $3.
CUBAN: That's good margins.
It's hard
to crack into the spa market
is the problem
because...
it's so hard.
...There's so few products
that spas carry.
It's so hard.
They'll usually
carry one product
and then
endorse the line.
So I understand why you're
having a problem getting in.
It's a really great concept,
but there's hundreds of people
that want to get in
but so few that ever can.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
It does take a lot to break
in this industry,
and I will --
yes.
How much money have you
put into it, Lauren?
I've put $50,000
into the business.
Where did you get
that money?
That's from money that
I have saved over the years.
Fishing is where
I do make my income.
The fishing is only three months
out of the year.
Scary, isn't it, when you put up
everything you have?
How much money do you make
on the fishing side?
I gross a little over
$100,000 a year.
Wow.
Well, good for you.
You bring in
$100,000 a year?
Yes.
That's incredible.
That's amazing.
I want to buy
into your fish business.
Do you fish alone?
I fish alone.
Wow!
Really?
You're a beast.
Congratulations.
I-I am a risk taker.
It's largely a man's world.
There are seven woman who
professionally commercial-fish
in the town that I'm in,
but this is something
that I really felt I could do,
and it was naive to think
that I could go into this
and build the business slowly
and organically.
I honestly --
Lauren,
one of the biggest challenges
is making the decision when
to grow something organically,
just grind it out,
or to spend a lot of money
and go big and then
create pull-through demand.
Mm-hmm.
You've got to connect
to something
that's already in place
so people can connect it to you.
You might
want to look at
changing it
to copper river glacial mud
or something to leverage it
because --
I think
it's a good idea.
But because there's a big leap
from where you are
to where I think
you need to be to be investable,
for those reasons,
I have to say that I'm out.
Alaska's hot right now.
Alaska tourists
spend over $300 million a year
in products
just in our price range.
HERJAVEC: So, Lauren, your mud
may actually be better,
but the consumer walking
into the spa doesn't know that.
That's why I'm here.
But --
I need your help.
I mean, I have been working
really hard to make this happen.
I mean --
oh, I hear you,
but you could spend millions
to educate a market.
You can't go global when
you're doing $36,000 a year.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you, Robert.
You've got a lot of good things
going for you.
Thank you, Barbara.
And you have
a great story.
I could see you hanging out
with the bears...
I am a very sweet person.
...On the sleds with the dogs
and by a beautiful river.
I want to make this happen.
I invest in a company
called nardo's,
exactly the same space
you're in,
about a year
and a half ago,
and I've learned a lot of things
about the cosmetic industry.
Here's the thing.
It's very hard
to be retail and spa.
You have to figure out
what your market is,
or you're gonna waste
a lot of money.
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.
Okay, thank you, Barbara.
CUBAN: Well, Lauren,
you've got --
I have Mr. mud face left.
[ laughter ]
Kevin has never
looked better.
O'LEARY:
My other problem with it
that none of the other sharks
picked up on
but anybody can go pick up mud
out of the copper river.
Right! They're gonna go
up there and say,
"Get out of the way,
Lauren.
That's my mud pile."
they're gonna squash me
like a bug.
No, no.
[ laughter ]
they've already done that.
O'LEARY: Tell me
if this is not the truth.
You're taking
a successful business --
your fishing business --
and subsidizing so far
an unsuccessful one.
I have a saying.
Any business that after
three years is not profitable
is not a business.
it's a hobby.
Look, I can't go down the river
with you on this one
because I've got mud
on my face.
[ chuckles ]
[ laughs ]
Okay, okay, look, look, look.
Look, Lauren --
I have companies
from China and Japan --
I've looked for every possible
reason to -- to invest.
I'm out.
Thank you. Well, thank you all
for your time.
Thanks, Lauren.
Thank you.
Really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Ciao.
Good luck.
Ciao.
I'm amazed that
she goes out alone and fishes.
That is amazing.
I think
I didn't get a deal today
because my sales
just weren't strong enough,
but I'm gonna charge on
and build the brand regardless.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
are entrepreneurs
with a clever way to hide an
unsightly, everyday necessity.
