and take the food out of
  my kids' mouths, I will fight!
I started this company
  'cause I was --
I was diagnosed with skin cancer
  at 26.
[ voice breaking ] I know
  I am just starting, but...
This is my passion.
I haven't have any food
  for eight days.
You are so full of crap!
  I don't get you.
CUBAN:
  You're the one who told us
you know your company
  inside and out.
We have sold
  a half a million of these.
Wow!
  what?!
NARRATOR:
  If the sharks hear a great idea,
they're ready to invest
  using their own money.
I want to give you
  an opportunity.
NARRATOR: And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
O'LEARY:
  I'll give you $75,000.
I want a royalty of 7%.
I say I give you the $150,000,
and we tell this bozo
  to take a walk.
Ohh!
NARRATOR:
  Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin o'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert
who grew
  his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand Fubu,
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.
Robert Herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents and
  has launched over 300 products,
grossing over a half a billion
  dollars in retail sales.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
  entrepreneur, tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas mavericks.
[ birds chirping ]
We have to put on our sunscreen.
  we got to be sun-safe.
I'm Betsy Johnson. I live
  in prairie village, Kansas,
with my amazing husband, Matt,
  and my adorable son, Andy.
Do you want to go outside?
  Time for a walk!
I was diagnosed with skin cancer
  at 26.
And it was actually
  one of the scariest things
that ever happened to me.
I quickly learned
  that one bad sunburn
can really affect people
  for the rest of their lives.
So I decided that I wanted
  to start a business
to keep everybody sun-safe.
JOHNSON: Hey, Ber!
  hi, Bets! How's it going?
It can be a bit of a struggle,
  because he lives in Pittsburgh.
Thankfully, for the internet,
  it makes it possible
for Berry and I
  to be in the same room.
I know
  that we're gonna be big.
Berry has reservations
  about coming on "Shark Tank,"
because he thinks
  we can do it on our own
without giving up
  any of our company.
But I feel
  we don't have the experience
and the business connections
  like the sharks.
If we don't get a deal
  with the sharks,
I don't think
  our business can grow as big
as it actually could be.
Hi, sharks. I'm Betsy Johnson.
And I'm Berry wanless.
BOTH: And we are the siblings
  behind Swimzip...
A sun-protective
  swimwear line.
WANLESS: We're seeking $60,000
  for a 5% stake in Swimzip.
JOHNSON: As parents,
  we want to keep our babies safe
and protected
  from the sun's harmful rays.
No matter how diligently
  we apply and reapply sunscreen,
we are still subjecting
  our children's skin
to the harsh sun and
  potentially painful sunburns.
Taking kids to the pool
  and beach should be fun,
but with all the screaming
  and fighting and fussing,
traditional sun-protective
  methods are such a chore.
There has to be
  a better way.
You got it!
  there has to be
  a better way.
Let us introduce you
  to the super-stylish
U.V.-protective swimwear line
that keeps kids sun-safe
  and parents sane.
Swimzip features
  our signature full-length zipper
down the front,
so it's extremely easy
  to put on and take off.
And both our tops
  and our bottoms
block 98% of U.V.A.
  and U.V.B. cancer-causing rays.
In fact, Swimzip's
  sun-protective swimwear
is so simple to put on,
kids can literally
  do it themselves.
Just one quick zip
  leads to a day
full of
  easy sun protection.
  wow!
  good job!
All right, sharks,
  who wants to zip up this deal?
Are you designing and
  manufacturing all of this today?
Yep. I do
  all the designs myself.
We create all the prints.
We work directly
  with the manufacturer.
It's very stylish.
  I love the little stuff.
Really quick,
  we got samples for you, so...
GREINER:
  oh, great. Great.
Totally.
Yeah.
  thanks.
GREINER:
  thank you.
JOHN: Thank you.
Is this an adult-size?
No. It's actually
  the kid-size.
Thanks, bud.
Our swimsuits
  actually come as sets,
so you get
  both a top and a bottom
when you purchase
  our product.
Wave bye!
  say thanks!
HERJAVEC:
  See you guys!
  Bye, guys!
What are your sales?
We sold $225,000
  this year.
HERJAVEC:
  Was that your first year?
That's our third year
  in business.
Third year. What were the sales
  the second year?
The second year, $18,000,
  so we've grown 1,100%.
How are you selling them?
We sell on Amazon.
  We sell on our website.
We also sell
  on the target website.
We also sell
  in high-end hotels.
JOHN: You're selling
  to the independent stores?
Yeah.
  It's fairly small, right?
It is fairly small
  right now.
We have stores that sell
  in Japan, Germany, Guam.
What are you
  making it for?
$5 to $7.
O'LEARY:
  What were your profits?
  $100,000.
But you didn't pay yourselves
  anything, right?
We currently
  don't take a salary.
O'LEARY:
  So, you've basically told me
  it's worth $1.2 million.
You're offering me 5%
  for $60,000, right?
Mm-hmm.
  You're making $100,000
  without paying yourselves.
If you each paid yourself
  $50,000,
which is not unreasonable,
  you make nothing.
This year, yes.
Is there anything unique about
  the materials that you're using?
Nope.
  It's swimsuit material.
HERJAVEC:
  the material is not unique.
What makes you unique
  is the fact that you have
that same material
  with a zipper up the front.
That's it.
No.
  Well, that's part of it.
What really sets it apart
  are our designs.
Betsy designs
  all of these suits herself.
But where we really come in
  is that our price point
is $15 wholesale,
  top and bottom.
The people who we're
  competing with are $45 to $60.
Without a zipper.
We're trying to get at what
  this business is really worth.
I think because you've
  established some market share
and you've proven you can
  design it -- I don't know --
I'd put a value on it
  of half a million bucks, maybe,
but it's not worth
  $1.2 million.
Let's ask our Fubu
  retail clothing guy.
Can I set this up myself
  for $500,000?
Yes.
So, what do
  I need you for?
I look at my money
  as gasoline.
I want to pour it
  on something
that I already understand
  how it works.
I just add money. I make
  more money. That's what I love.
There's no place
  for me to pour my money into.
I don't see it here.
I'm out.
We are
  on the target website,
and we actually have
  an exclusive line for them.
They have not taken you
  into the stores yet?
No. We're trying to work
  right now to do a test
  in the Southern stores.
JOHN:
  you don't want to do that.
Why not?
The big guys and girls
  can crush you
with just
  one set of returns.
Yeah.
Their margins
  are so, so small.
You want to stay where you are,
  with the boutiques.
But that's
  part of the problem here.
You're a little green
  in understanding all this.
Now, I have to
  take my hat off to you.
You made it past
  the hardest point --
to show proof of concept.
  well -- yeah.
But there's bad stuff
  coming.
It's a tough one for me, because
  I see the growth potential here.
It's just a little too early
  for me, so I'm out.
JOHNSON:
  I started this company
'cause I was diagnosed
  with skin cancer at 26.
[ voice breaking ]
  and, you know...
I had insurance
  and a paycheck...
And quit.
I decided to try to take
  this on, and this is my passion.
Like, I know this company
  and sun protection
is the wave of the future,
and we're starting
  with swimwear.
And, you know,
  I still have a lot to learn.
But I'm a fighter,
  and I will build this brand,
and I will build this swimwear
to be the best swimwear line
  that kids can have.
I'm a mommy on a mission.
My 1-year-old is just --
  he is my world.
And we go to the park,
and he wears his Swimzips,
  because I can't find anything.
I am pushing this product.
I know I am just starting,
  and I have made mistakes,
but we will bring this company
  to something huge.
And, you know, I just --
  i-i don't think you understand.
We're just at the tip
  of the iceberg here.
$225,000 sales is nothing
  to laugh at by -- by any means.
And I think Daymond's right --
  you are green.
But, you know, frankly,
  all of us up here,
if we knew the things we should
  be afraid of in business,
we may have never started.
[ laughs ]
  Right?
Yeah, that's true.
And what is really apparent
  about you and you, Berry,
is that, you know,
the best way to get over
  doubt and inexperience
is simply action.
I'm just struggling with,
  how do you go
from a little boutique business
  to millions of dollars?
I don't have the answer.
And because
  I don't see the answer,
I'm not gonna give you
  my money today.
I'm out.
Betsy, you're a beast.
Thanks.
  and that's
  an enormous compliment.
Berry, you're there to help her,
  and that's a great thing.
But you're still
  a family business.
And family businesses aren't
  to the point of their life cycle
where they can just explode.
You haven't even broken out
of the "I'm hiring my friends
  and family" mode yet.
Then you get to 10 employees
  or 15 employees.
Then you have to manage
  those employees, right?
It's just a huge step.
  and until you get to that step,
it's much more difficult
  to be ignited
and to have
  that inflection point.
And honestly,
  I learned a lot of lessons
from the 30 companies
  I've invested in on "Shark Tank"
that proved that point to me.
Well, I want
  a strategic investor.
I don't want to be
  a family business.
Like I said, I want this
  out there, and I need the help.
I'm out.
Okay, we have one shark left.
  Lori?
You know, I was a one-man band
  for five years.
I had passion and drive
  and a dream, and I made it.
I'm sitting here today.
JOHNSON: Yeah.
I see so much of that
  in you.
Thank you.
Because you are not only smart,
  you're right on trend,
because melanoma is
  one of the number-one killers.
Yeah.
And it starts in children.
So...
...I want to give you
  an opportunity here,
because I believe in you.
So, I'm going to give you
  the $60,000
for a 20% equity stake.
I personally want you
  to be open to going into target
and other places,
but we're just going to ask
  for terms that don't hurt us.
I love that.
  so, no returns.
You're --
  see, this is what I need,
is I need the experience,
  and you've done it.
Well, you're doing really well
  yourself,
and that's why
  I want to get behind you --
because sometimes, you just
  have to get behind people
that are doing
  the right thing.
  thank you.
So, that's my offer.
That's evaluation of you
  at $300,000.
That's fair.
Because you don't make
  any money.
I think it's too low.
You know what, Lori?
Would you be willing
  to do $120,000 for 20%?
Ohh!
NARRATOR:
  Four sharks are out.
Betsy and Berry
  have an offer from Lori --
$60,000
  for 20% of their company --
but they have made
  a counteroffer,
surprising the sharks.
You know what, Lori?
Would you be willing
  to do $120,000 for 20%?
Ohh!
We were at $60,000 for 20%.
  CUBAN: Dang!
So --
  I had a lot of confidence in you
  four or five minutes ago.
It's your drive, your passion,
  that hard work,
what I think you can do.
But now
  I'm getting worried,
because you're showing me
  a different side.
You have to
  gain my confidence back now.
I'm not going to change my
  number, but I want to make sure
that I've just picked
  the right person.
Well, I do believe in it.
I just want to -- I want to
  make sure I have enough capital.
CUBAN: You're the one
  who came in that asked for
  a specific amount of money.
You're the one who
  told us you know your
  company inside and out.
You're the one who told us
  you only need the expertise.
  we value at five-times sales,
and she's devaluing
  our company,
and I believe
  that it's worth that.
  yeah, but, Betsy,
  hang on a second.
[ sharks arguing ]
100% of nothing
  is still nothing!
  you make no money!
You have no paycheck.
We need this deal.
JOHN: Berry,
  why aren't you saying much?
Why are you so hesitant?
'cause I think I'm the reason
  that she's not saying yes.
Why? Why not?
  why isn't she
  saying yes?
Because I believe
  in our company.
I think we are gonna be
  a $5 million company.
And if we're giving someone
  this 20% stake right now,
it's a huge, huge part
  of our business.
I don't want to push you
  into anything.
If you're not comfortable
  with this deal, don't take it.
I'm taking a chance on you
  because I believed in you.
A bigger chance, now,
  than you thought.
This is about money.
  make a decision.
What do you want to do?
Let's try it.
Okay.
All right.
  Lori, you have a deal!
Oh. All right. Good.
[ laughs ]
  [ sighs ]
Berry, you have to get
  on the train.
  let's do this!
I'm on the train.
  all right.
  good. Good.
Bye. Thank you.
  HERJAVEC:
  Good luck, guys.
Berry, ask for a paycheck.
We got it! Yes!
Lori,
  we are gonna do this!
WANLESS: I think I was
  a little hesitant at first
because we do
  value our company a lot
and we do anticipate
  huge sales.
But I do think,
  at the end of the day,
  it was the right deal
and that Lori's gonna be
  fantastic, a fantastic partner.
We're really excited
  about that.
NARRATOR: In season 2,
Kimberly Nelson made a deal
  with Barbara Corcoran
for her homemade-cake business,
  Daisy Cakes.
What do you think?
  Do we have a deal?
Of course.
Whew!
Let's see what she's doing now.
Daisy Cakes has gone through
  some major changes
since my last update.
On my last update, we moved
  all the baking out of state
to a large-production bakery.
It seemed like the only way
  to meet the demand
and keep my customers happy.
For a few months,
  everything was good.
And then things just started
  to spiral downward.
We made a couple
  of really poor hiring decisions,
and the quality of the cakes
  was so bad,
we lost nearly $150,000
  in bad product.
The worst part is,
that damaged our reputation
  with our most loyal customers.
We take a lot of pride
in these Daisy Cakes
  being made the right way.
So, with some really good
  words of advice from Barbara,
we decided to bring
  the Daisy Cakes baking back here
to Pauline, South Carolina,
  where it started.
So, how are y'all doing
  on these? You got enough?
We're back to basics here,
and I've hired
  a great team of employees.
And I learned
  a really big lesson --
that's that nobody's gonna make
  a Daisy cake
the way my mom and I
  are gonna make a Daisy cake.
CORCORAN: I knew I'd be
  finding you hard at work!
Come on!
  show me the operation!
  oh, my God!
Barbara has been
  a tremendous support,
and her guidance has been just
  what we needed for Daisy Cakes.
Our projected sales
  for Daisy Cakes
over the next year
  should be close to $3 million.
Let me tell you something.
  we're just getting started.
CORCORAN:
  When you're growing a business,
it's a series of mistakes that
  you have to learn to overcome.
Kim has the magic ingredient
  of every great entrepreneur.
When she gets hit,
  she pops right back up.
And that's why Kim is succeeding
  again at Daisy Cakes.
NELSON: Just because
  you get a deal on "Shark Tank"
doesn't mean
  it's going to be an easy road.
But with Barbara by my side,
I know the future
  for Daisy Cakes has no limits.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is an accomplished entrepreneur
from San Diego, California,
  with a simple way to stay fit.
Hello, sharks.
And I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange
  for 20% of the company.
Fitdeck is a custom deck
  of fitness playing cards
that makes exercise more simple,
  convenient, and fun.
Each card has an illustration
and instructions
  on how to perform the exercise.
So all you need to do
  is shuffle, deal, and go.
Can we see a package?
Sure.
And where are you
  selling them?
Primarily from our website,
  direct to consumer.
That's about 75%
  of our business.
So, why don't you take
  Fitdeck body weight?
HERJAVEC: Thank you.
This is cross training,
  Daymond,
thank you.
  our equivalent to crossfit.
Thank you.
And, of course, mark --
  Fitdeck basketball.
Appreciate that.
So, sharks,
  who's ready to go all-in?
HERJAVEC: Okay,
  walk me through a single unit.
What do you sell it for?
  what does it cost to make?
That sells for $14.95
  on our website.
It costs about $2 to make.
Are you selling
  a lot of these cards right now?
We have sold a half a million
  of these Fitdecks.
Wow!
  what?!
  in how long
  a period of time?
That's been
  over the last seven years or so.
Ohh.
  the majority of those have been
  in the last four years or so.
Well, how many
  did you sell last year?
Last year,
  we sold 55,000.
So, how many dollars
  is that?
Last year, $640,000.
Very impressive.
  what was your profit?
Last year,
  the profit was a break-even.
Why? How could you
  only break even?
HERJAVEC:
  there's something missing.
You got to be making
  a ton of money.
Or you got screwed
  somewhere along the line.
Well, last year
  was an anomaly.
The prior years, we had
  an average of $725,000 in sales
with an average profit
  of about $120,000.
So, when your sales dropped,
  your profit was wiped out?
Correct.
And we're breaking it down
  for you to make it very simple.
What would you like
  the $300,000 for?
The $300,000 is gonna amount
to where we think
  the future of the business is.
So 75% to 80% of that, we feel
  is going on the digital side.
You're planning
  to sell that app?
  correct.
CUBAN:
  that's a tough business.
  we've been selling that app
for the last --
  that's a very tough space.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
  you've been selling --
  you have an app?
We've been selling it
  for about four or five months.
We're getting
  1,000 downloads a month
with very little marketing.
It's all free
  at that point, right?
No, we sell this
  for $9.99.
How did you come up with this?
  tell us about your background.
I was a Navy Seal
  for almost six years.
CUBAN: You were?
  yes.
Oh! All right. Thank you.
  good for you.
Yeah, well, actually,
  the idea for Fitdeck
was based on a card game that I
  played with my college roommates
at Yale University.
And it was a game called "pug,"
  short for "push-up game."
now, this became
  a campus-wide sensation at Yale.
You know,
  it made an impression on me.
I graduated from Yale,
and I went to one of the biggest
  investment banks in the world
for about 2 1/2 years.
You were an investment banker,
  and that wasn't enough,
so then
  you were a Navy Seal.
I came to my senses after
  the investment banking
  and became a seal.
So, now you're flying around
  the world doing crazy stuff.
  HERJAVEC:
  okay, and then what happened?
Well, while I was flying
  around the world,
we had every fitness product
  and program in the world
at our fingertips,
  and guess what we played.
Pug?
  we played the pug game!
I left, and I went
  to Harvard business school.
And there --
  [ laughter ]
HERJAVEC: Okay! Stop!
All that training --
  you came up with cards?!
Exactly!
So, finish the story.
So, I said,
  "why stop at push-ups?
"why not take this pug concept
and create a business
  out of it -- Fitdeck?"
we can attack all things --
  not just body-weight exercises,
but yoga, pilates, stretching,
  crossfit, basketball.
HERJAVEC:
  how old are you?!
Are you like 58? How could
  you have time to do all that?
I'm 43.
  most of this was done --
I have four kids, too, so they
  keep me pretty busy, as well.
[ laughs ]
  and a dog.
You understand the idea
  of milking it now...
Yes.
  if you've already got
  the infrastructure.
I don't know
  how long this lasts,
but you could probably pull a
  couple million bucks out of it.
That's what I'm hoping to do,
  Kevin. That's why I'm here.
There are
  hundreds of thousands of apps,
and probably hundreds
  of thousands minus 1,000
have gone out of business.
I just don't see that
  as being an equitable outcome.
[ chuckles ] Right? I just
  don't see the future there.
And so, for that reason,
  I'm out.
We have the story. We have
  authenticity. We have a brand.
And you're a Navy Seal!
Exactly!
And lastly, if there's one thing
  that I think all of us share...
What?
  ...We can fight.
Robert,
  I know you can fight.
Lori, I know you can fight.
Kevin, I know you can fight.
  Daymond, I know can fight.
Is anyone gonna argue
  that Mark Cuban can fight?
Guess what --
  I can fight, too!
  yeah, but I fight for me.
  I can fight for me.
I can fight for you!
  I ain't fighting for you.
Someone wants to
  come after my business, Kevin,
and take the food out of
  my kids' mouths, I will fight!
  whoa.
Whoo!
  you guys want to join me?
  we'll all fight!
a bodyguard, and a trainer
  all at the same time.
All right!
  [ laughter ]
um, you know,
  it's amazing.
But, you know, applications --
  it's the new gold rush.
Everybody with a computer
  believes they have one.
You know, the money you have to
  spend to keep this current,
I just don't know if I can help
  you and I think it's worth it.
You have a --
I -- [ sighs ]
I'm out.
Where you and I digress
is there's something wrong
  in the business.
You're selling 700,000
for a product where your margin
  is unbelievable,
and you can't make money
  at it.
Very impressive story.
  thank you for your service.
But I'm out.
You -- as a technology person,
  you know,
the fact that we have
  500,000 decks out there,
that we can move people over
  and migrate them --
and I pretty well get it
  very quickly.
I don't get you.
and I think everybody else here
  would do the same.
This is not it.
  I'm out.
and into the business,
and as a Navy Seal, I've swum
  with real sharks before.
And given the choice,
  I'd probably go back
to the real sharks
  and stay away from those guys.
NARRATOR: Next up
  is an entrepreneur with a pill
that he feels everyone
  should have just in case.
Hello, sharks.
and I've created a product
  called Life Caps.
I'm here
  seeking a $200,000 investment
in exchange
  for 30% of my company.
Now, sharks,
  can I ask you a question?
Do I look healthy?
Do I look mentally alert?
I haven't had any food
  for eight days.
[ chuckles ]
Life caps is
  a life-saving survival pill
that you can take
  in times of emergency
when food is not available.
Life caps satisfies hunger.
  I am not hungry.
Life caps provides nutrition.
  I am mentally alert.
I got the idea a few years ago
when I saw a story
  about coal miners
that were trapped underground
  in Southern Utah.
The rescue workers were drilling
  a 4-inch hole down 1,500 feet,
trying to get food and water
  down to the miners.
Then I thought, "why doesn't
  somebody come up with an idea
like a pill that could
  sustain life in an emergency?"
then I thought, "why not me?"
  I'm a musician.
I knew nothing about
  formulating a food product,
so I reached out to a friend
  of mine who had created
some of the top-selling
  energy bars in America.
And a few weeks later,
  Life Caps was born.
Life caps is perfect
  for any emergency situation,
such as earthquakes,
  tornados, hurricanes --
even campers, hikers, Hunters.
With your help, I feel we can
  get the word out to the masses
about this amazing new product
  and help a lot of people
become better prepared
  for the unexpected.
Thank you.
O'LEARY:
  Now, you didn't tell us
how long the shelf life is
  of this pill.
I have
  a five-year shelf life.
You really haven't eaten
  in eight days -- nothing?
Swear to God.
Just water and the pill?
This is nothing --
  I went 17 days,
and they put me on a show
  in Salt Lake City.
Four ladies were interviewing.
  they kept saying,
"Oh, my gosh!
  you must have lost weight!"
six, seven times.
  did you lose weight?
First of all,
  this is not a diet pill.
Yes, I've lost some weight.
And I think if you lose a little
  weight to save your life,
that's a small price to pay.
But the point is, these women
  were looking to you
and going,
  "hmm. diet aid." right?
Well, I know
  they were thinking that,
because there was
  a 10,000 viewership on the show.
It was 98% women.
And after I said that,
  we sold out.
We did $30,000 in sales.
HERJAVEC:
  did you have one every day?
I take a pill for breakfast,
  one for lunch, one for dinner,
and if I'm hungry at night,
  I'll take a snack.
[ pops lips ]
[ laughs ]
  Would you like to try it?
Yes!
Absolutely not. Could we see
  the packaging, though?
Mark, "absolutely not"?
Absolutely not!
Okay. Here you go.
Thank you.
And, basically,
  everything in here
is like what's in some
  of the vitamins that I take.
Isn't this just a vitamin?
There is a huge difference.
You know
  when bears hibernate,
they go seven months
  without food?
How do they do that?
  Bears don't die.
They buy Life Caps.
  [ laughter ]
when your body gets pure
  nutrition but zero calories,
it feels free
  to burn body fat.
I'm surviving right now
  on my own body fat.
That's how bears hibernate.
We've created
  a metabolic trigger
which allows the body to burn
  its own fat for stored energy.
How much weight did you lose
  in that eight days?
I burn a pound a day when I'm
  doing this, and nothing else.
8 pounds?
JOHN: Let me ask you
  something here.
At the end of the day, you want
  a bunch of people to say,
"I want to just not eat
  and take this instead."
No, that's not
  what I'm going for at all.
Well, how do I make money?
  well, then how do we
  make money? Yeah.
Because I'm gonna buy
  one pack. I don't need to
  buy another for five years.
CUBAN: You guys seriously
  are considering
looking at making money
  from this nonsense?
I want to know --
I'm just -- I want to know
  what he's thinking.
and everybody goes nuts.
If this was real,
you would be telling us about
  how you took it to doctors,
how you've had studies done.
I want to do
  a clinical study.
I didn't have the money
  to do it.
You have had
  $100,000 in sales.
  my doctor -- I went
  and got a checkup on my 13th --
my doctor looked at it.
You are so full of crap.
You keep on going back
  to all this nonsense, right?
Well, I haven't eaten
  for eight days.
I have no crap in me --
  trust me.
[ laughter ]
and forget about
  all the objections to this.
My biggest problem with it
is that I have to have
  a few of these
sitting on the shelf
  in case the zombies come.
[ laughs ]
The trouble is,
  I'm not buying any more
until the zombies come,
  so I just buy it once,
sits on my shelf
  waiting for zombies.
That's no good.
That's the problem.
  how do I make money?
That's the only problem?
Let's say this works.
  why are we talking
  about this?!
Look, I see why you came up
  with this angle.
No one can contest it.
If this truly worked,
  it'd be really, really easy
to take it to doctors
  and do studies.
But instead, you come here
  like a snake-oil salesperson
knowing that you're gonna prey
  on everybody watching
the minute you said
  you lose 1 pound per day
when you take this.
That's wrong.
I'm out, as Kevin says,
  with prejudice.
Mark, I agree.
  we backdoored the diet industry.
Like I said, I'm a musician.
I don't know
  all the ins and outs.
What have you been doing
  for five years?!
  you know what, though?
He's a hustler.
  I did a real-world study.
GREINER:
  Whenever somebody is selling
  something that you ingest,
you have to be
  a really responsible person
and make sure that what
  you're giving everybody is safe.
Doing the clinical trials
  and the studies
and all of that beforehand
  is really important.
You haven't done that.
I'm out.
Barbara,
  can I explain one thing?
I'm not Barbara.
  oh, excuse me -- Lori.
[ laughter ]
That mental thing
  is not holding up.
Whoops. Yeah.
That mental thing
  is not holding up.
HERJAVEC:
  you know, the problem is,
  people want a shortcut.
People don't want
  to put the discipline in
it takes to eat healthy
  and lose weight and so on.
So, a guy like you comes along,
  and people see a shortcut.
And they don't look
  behind the facade.
I think
  it's irresponsible.
I'm out.
You know, the presentation
  started off like steak.
It started to look like
  filet mignon.
But, as the other sharks
  pointed out,
no FDA approval, no research,
  no clinical trials.
The filet mignon,
  the steak,
just became
  a rotten pack of baloney.
I'm out.
CUBAN:
  And then there was one.
I'm just a guy
  trying to scratch out a living.
I ask myself, can I make
  any money investing in this?
And the answer is no.
I'm out.
and I appreciate
  what you're doing for people.
You're putting people to work,
  helping entrepreneurs.
It's an honor to meet you all.
  thank you.
Thank you.
  thank you.
CUBAN: He's such
  a snake-oil salesperson.
He's gonna go anywhere
  that there's an audience
and hope
  that somebody says yes.
I get slimy
  just thinking about him. Next!
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is a mom from Provo, Utah,
with a stylish and functional
  way to cover tiny feet.
And I'm asking for $150,000
  for 10%.
Freshly picked is
  the world's best baby moccasin.
When my second child, Gus,
  was born,
I looked everywhere
  for this type of shoe.
Soft soles are
  actually better for babies
that are learning to walk
because they can flex their toes
  with every step,
and this promotes balance.
I couldn't find the shoe
  that I was looking for,
so I decided to try my hand
  at making one.
I had a bag of scrap leather
that I'd gotten
  from a garage sale,
and I taught myself how to sew.
I worked through
  six different designs
until I landed on one
  that fit the bill.
Let me show you
  how amazing my moccasins are.
These are gonna remind you
  of your days on the track.
GREINER: Adorable.
Stay golden.
Oh, thank you.
  they're so cute.
Thank you.
  'cause I like your heart.
And for your team.
HERJAVEC:
  they're beautiful.
Yeah, really cute.
Where do you make these?
I started out making these
  all by myself.
Two years ago, I hired
  a local girl to help me,
and then we also get them made
  in California, as well.
And what are
  your sales?
$500,000.
$500,000?!
That's a big number.
  this year.
GREINER: Wow!
  wow!
  O'LEARY: This year?
Good for you.
and bought
  at least three more times.
That's very impressive.
Can a baby easily
  just pull it off?
No. That's the thing.
The elastic keeps it
  around their ankle.
My husband was in school,
  and we were really, really poor.
My brother owns
  a window-installation business,
and so I convinced him
  one summer
to give me all the old windows
  he took out.
And I spent the whole summer
  out there during that time
in the heat banging the glass
  out of those windows,
'cause they're aluminum-frame.
I took those frames
  to the scrapyard
at the end of the summer,
  and I got $200.
And I was able to buy
  one hide of leather,
which makes
  about 40 moccasins.
That's really great.
And then I just continually
  put it back in.
And that's why we had
  kind of a slow start.
That literally
  is the best story
to start a company
  I've ever heard.
How much
  do these sell for?
I don't think
  we got a price point.
$60 retail.
  $60 a pair?
60 bucks?
  uh-huh.
And what do you
  make them for?
We're at about $17,
  'cause we're still domestic.
What's the projection
  for next year?
I think with
  just my social media alone,
I can do
  between $2- and $3 million.
That's a lot
  of baby shoes.
I am gaining about 1,500 new
  followers on Instagram a week,
and we've found that
  about 10% of our Instagram buy.
And do you have retailers
  that are customers?
Any brick and mortar?
We have a lot of retailers
  that are interested,
but I can't keep up
  with the demand.
I need the money
  to make a big order overseas.
This next year,
  my vision for the company
is to start
  moving into retail.
I'm just wondering --
  how in love with retail are you?
Because it's a very tough
  business on the inventory side.
I really -- I want to --
I want to build
  a big, big, big company.
But you want to make money.
  you're right.
Retail's like a siren
  on an ancient ship,
drawing the sailors towards her
  and then drowning them.
That's what happens.
  it's true.
And I've seen it happen
  many, many times.
They take your capital.
They put your product
  in the store.
  they get paid, plus 30 days.
of taking the windows
  and pulling out the aluminum
should be
  in every business book,
should be
  in every entrepreneur's guide.
You personify
  the American dream
of saying,
  "get off my butt,
and let's go out there
  and get it done."
thank you, mark.
Now, that said, right,
I'm not the guy
  for the baby-shoes world.
I'd be learning from you more
  than you'd be learning from me.
I can't respect you enough,
  but I have to say I'm out.
Okay.
to make a great business
  and to run your business.
I actually think that
  you'll be better on your own.
So, for that reason,
  I'm out.
How many pairs do you think
  you're gonna sell in a year?
Next year?
  yeah.
Between 25,000 to 30,000.
So, if you feel
  you're gonna do that --
which is more than awesome,
  it's amazing --
why do you feel
  you need the $150,000?
Why take on a partner?
Well,
  I haven't been to school.
This is my first business,
and I have been burned
  a couple times.
And I really --
  I -- I love advice.
No one ever
  has to do the work for me.
As shown, I will do it.
But I need help
  with manufacturing.
That's a big one for me.
I don't want
  10% of a company.
That's just -- it doesn't
  get me up in the morning.
I mean,
  that's just not enough
for all the headaches
  you're gonna be.
I -- I am not a headache.
Business is always
  full of headaches. Trust me.
But you have
  high margins.
So, I'm gonna set up
  a rather crafty way of doing it.
You have to get $150,000,
and in this deal,
I need this guy
  more than he needs me.
But I bring a lot
  to the table
in terms of making you
  bigger than you are.
I'll give you $75,000,
and the way I would structure it
  is -- no equity.
Don't want any.
I want a royalty.
I'd like to do a royalty
  of 7%
until my $75,000 comes back,
and then drop it down to 5%.
And you can well afford that,
  actually.
You have to give her
  $150,000, kev.
No, but I only have $75,000,
  unfortunately.
I wonder
  if anybody else has $75,000.
So, that means, Daymond,
  you have to give her $75,000.
NARRATOR:
  three sharks are out.
and we tell this bozo
  to take a walk.
Ooh.
25%.
  wow. That's expensive.
I'm 25% of a partnership
  with you,
and I'll help you
  with everything.
That's a lot of equity.
This is a real debate
  for you, now.
It really is.
  no, it's not.
Kevin, I really thank you
  for your offer, but I think
at this point in my business,
  where I want to grow to,
I don't think it's smart
  for me to give you 7%.
What would you give me
  if I kept my equity at zero?
Tell him to take a walk
  and let's do this.
I would give you a kiss.
Ohh!
  yeah!
  what?!
That -- that is cheap.
  that's cheap.
  that's what's in it for me --
  a kiss?
Tell him to take a walk.
  why are you not dealing
  with Daymond?
because of what you've done
  and what you've accomplished.
I normally would want 1/3.
I would like to stay
  at 25%.
So, $150,000 for 25%
  values my company at $600,000,
which is almost
  what I've done this year.
I think next month,
  I'll hit that mark.
But you're
  my dream investor.
It's six times your profits.
  it's six times your profit.
It's not -- it's not what
  I'm valuing your company at.
Yeah.
  it's what
  I'm valuing my time at.
'cause when you put in
  the valuation,
if we were
  just purely doing valuation,
that means
  I just write you $150,000
and I look in my mailbox every
  quarter and I don't help you.
