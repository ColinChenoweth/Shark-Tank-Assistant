I'm Betsy Johnson. I live
  in prairie village, Kansas,
with my amazing husband, Matt,
  and my adorable son, Andy.
Do you want to go outside?
  Time for a walk!
I was diagnosed with skin cancer
  at 26.
And it was actually
  one of the scariest things
that ever happened to me.
I quickly learned
  that one bad sunburn
can really affect people
  for the rest of their lives.
So I decided that I wanted
  to start a business
to keep everybody sun-safe.
JOHNSON: Hey, Ber!
  hi, Bets! How's it going?
It can be a bit of a struggle,
  because he lives in Pittsburgh.
Thankfully, for the internet,
  it makes it possible
for Berry and I
  to be in the same room.
I know
  that we're gonna be big.
Berry has reservations
  about coming on "Shark Tank,"
because he thinks
  we can do it on our own
without giving up
  any of our company.
But I feel
  we don't have the experience
and the business connections
  like the sharks.
If we don't get a deal
  with the sharks,
I don't think
  our business can grow as big
as it actually could be.
Hi, sharks. I'm Betsy Johnson.
And I'm Berry wanless.
BOTH: And we are the siblings
  behind Swimzip...
A sun-protective
  swimwear line.
WANLESS: We're seeking $60,000
  for a 5% stake in Swimzip.
JOHNSON: As parents,
  we want to keep our babies safe
and protected
  from the sun's harmful rays.
No matter how diligently
  we apply and reapply sunscreen,
we are still subjecting
  our children's skin
to the harsh sun and
  potentially painful sunburns.
Taking kids to the pool
  and beach should be fun,
but with all the screaming
  and fighting and fussing,
traditional sun-protective
  methods are such a chore.
There has to be
  a better way.
You got it!
  there has to be
  a better way.
Let us introduce you
  to the super-stylish
U.V.-protective swimwear line
that keeps kids sun-safe
  and parents sane.
Swimzip features
  our signature full-length zipper
down the front,
so it's extremely easy
  to put on and take off.
And both our tops
  and our bottoms
block 98% of U.V.A.
  and U.V.B. cancer-causing rays.
In fact, Swimzip's
  sun-protective swimwear
is so simple to put on,
kids can literally
  do it themselves.
Just one quick zip
  leads to a day
full of
  easy sun protection.
  wow!
  good job!
All right, sharks,
  who wants to zip up this deal?
Are you designing and
  manufacturing all of this today?
Yep. I do
  all the designs myself.
We create all the prints.
We work directly
  with the manufacturer.
It's very stylish.
  I love the little stuff.
Really quick,
  we got samples for you, so...
GREINER:
  oh, great. Great.
Totally.
Yeah.
  thanks.
GREINER:
  thank you.
JOHN: Thank you.
Is this an adult-size?
No. It's actually
  the kid-size.
Thanks, bud.
Our swimsuits
  actually come as sets,
so you get
  both a top and a bottom
when you purchase
  our product.
Wave bye!
  say thanks!
HERJAVEC:
  See you guys!
  Bye, guys!
What are your sales?
We sold $225,000
  this year.
HERJAVEC:
  Was that your first year?
That's our third year
  in business.
Third year. What were the sales
  the second year?
The second year, $18,000,
  so we've grown 1,100%.
How are you selling them?
We sell on Amazon.
  We sell on our website.
We also sell
  on the target website.
We also sell
  in high-end hotels.
JOHN: You're selling
  to the independent stores?
Yeah.
  It's fairly small, right?
It is fairly small
  right now.
We have stores that sell
  in Japan, Germany, Guam.
What are you
  making it for?
$5 to $7.
O'LEARY:
  What were your profits?
  $100,000.
But you didn't pay yourselves
  anything, right?
We currently
  don't take a salary.
O'LEARY:
  So, you've basically told me
  it's worth $1.2 million.
You're offering me 5%
  for $60,000, right?
Mm-hmm.
  You're making $100,000
  without paying yourselves.
If you each paid yourself
  $50,000,
which is not unreasonable,
  you make nothing.
This year, yes.
Is there anything unique about
  the materials that you're using?
Nope.
  It's swimsuit material.
HERJAVEC:
  the material is not unique.
What makes you unique
  is the fact that you have
that same material
  with a zipper up the front.
That's it.
No.
  Well, that's part of it.
What really sets it apart
  are our designs.
Betsy designs
  all of these suits herself.
But where we really come in
  is that our price point
is $15 wholesale,
  top and bottom.
The people who we're
  competing with are $45 to $60.
Without a zipper.
We're trying to get at what
  this business is really worth.
I think because you've
  established some market share
and you've proven you can
  design it -- I don't know --
I'd put a value on it
  of half a million bucks, maybe,
but it's not worth
  $1.2 million.
Let's ask our Fubu
  retail clothing guy.
Can I set this up myself
  for $500,000?
Yes.
So, what do
  I need you for?
I look at my money
  as gasoline.
I want to pour it
  on something
that I already understand
  how it works.
I just add money. I make
  more money. That's what I love.
There's no place
  for me to pour my money into.
I don't see it here.
I'm out.
We are
  on the target website,
and we actually have
  an exclusive line for them.
They have not taken you
  into the stores yet?
No. We're trying to work
  right now to do a test
  in the Southern stores.
JOHN:
  you don't want to do that.
Why not?
The big guys and girls
  can crush you
with just
  one set of returns.
Yeah.
Their margins
  are so, so small.
You want to stay where you are,
  with the boutiques.
But that's
  part of the problem here.
You're a little green
  in understanding all this.
Now, I have to
  take my hat off to you.
You made it past
  the hardest point --
to show proof of concept.
  well -- yeah.
But there's bad stuff
  coming.
It's a tough one for me, because
  I see the growth potential here.
It's just a little too early
  for me, so I'm out.
JOHNSON:
  I started this company
'cause I was diagnosed
  with skin cancer at 26.
[ voice breaking ]
  and, you know...
I had insurance
  and a paycheck...
And quit.
I decided to try to take
  this on, and this is my passion.
Like, I know this company
  and sun protection
is the wave of the future,
and we're starting
  with swimwear.
And, you know,
  I still have a lot to learn.
But I'm a fighter,
  and I will build this brand,
and I will build this swimwear
to be the best swimwear line
  that kids can have.
I'm a mommy on a mission.
My 1-year-old is just --
  he is my world.
And we go to the park,
and he wears his Swimzips,
  because I can't find anything.
I am pushing this product.
I know I am just starting,
  and I have made mistakes,
but we will bring this company
  to something huge.
And, you know, I just --
  i-i don't think you understand.
We're just at the tip
  of the iceberg here.
$225,000 sales is nothing
  to laugh at by -- by any means.
And I think Daymond's right --
  you are green.
But, you know, frankly,
  all of us up here,
if we knew the things we should
  be afraid of in business,
we may have never started.
[ laughs ]
  Right?
Yeah, that's true.
And what is really apparent
  about you and you, Berry,
is that, you know,
the best way to get over
  doubt and inexperience
is simply action.
I'm just struggling with,
  how do you go
from a little boutique business
  to millions of dollars?
I don't have the answer.
And because
  I don't see the answer,
I'm not gonna give you
  my money today.
I'm out.
Betsy, you're a beast.
Thanks.
  and that's
  an enormous compliment.
Berry, you're there to help her,
  and that's a great thing.
But you're still
  a family business.
And family businesses aren't
  to the point of their life cycle
where they can just explode.
You haven't even broken out
of the "I'm hiring my friends
  and family" mode yet.
Then you get to 10 employees
  or 15 employees.
Then you have to manage
  those employees, right?
It's just a huge step.
  and until you get to that step,
it's much more difficult
  to be ignited
and to have
  that inflection point.
And honestly,
  I learned a lot of lessons
from the 30 companies
  I've invested in on "Shark Tank"
that proved that point to me.
Well, I want
  a strategic investor.
I don't want to be
  a family business.
Like I said, I want this
  out there, and I need the help.
I'm out.
Okay, we have one shark left.
  Lori?
You know, I was a one-man band
  for five years.
I had passion and drive
  and a dream, and I made it.
I'm sitting here today.
JOHNSON: Yeah.
I see so much of that
  in you.
Thank you.
Because you are not only smart,
  you're right on trend,
because melanoma is
  one of the number-one killers.
Yeah.
And it starts in children.
So...
...I want to give you
  an opportunity here,
because I believe in you.
So, I'm going to give you
  the $60,000
for a 20% equity stake.
I personally want you
  to be open to going into target
and other places,
but we're just going to ask
  for terms that don't hurt us.
I love that.
  so, no returns.
You're --
  see, this is what I need,
is I need the experience,
  and you've done it.
Well, you're doing really well
  yourself,
and that's why
  I want to get behind you --
because sometimes, you just
  have to get behind people
that are doing
  the right thing.
  thank you.
So, that's my offer.
That's evaluation of you
  at $300,000.
That's fair.
Because you don't make
  any money.
I think it's too low.
You know what, Lori?
Would you be willing
  to do $120,000 for 20%?
Ohh!
NARRATOR:
  Four sharks are out.
Betsy and Berry
  have an offer from Lori --
$60,000
  for 20% of their company --
but they have made
  a counteroffer,
surprising the sharks.
You know what, Lori?
Would you be willing
  to do $120,000 for 20%?
Ohh!
We were at $60,000 for 20%.
  CUBAN: Dang!
So --
  I had a lot of confidence in you
  four or five minutes ago.
It's your drive, your passion,
  that hard work,
what I think you can do.
But now
  I'm getting worried,
because you're showing me
  a different side.
You have to
  gain my confidence back now.
I'm not going to change my
  number, but I want to make sure
that I've just picked
  the right person.
Well, I do believe in it.
I just want to -- I want to
  make sure I have enough capital.
CUBAN: You're the one
  who came in that asked for
  a specific amount of money.
You're the one who
  told us you know your
  company inside and out.
You're the one who told us
  you only need the expertise.
  we value at five-times sales,
and she's devaluing
  our company,
and I believe
  that it's worth that.
  yeah, but, Betsy,
  hang on a second.
[ sharks arguing ]
100% of nothing
  is still nothing!
  you make no money!
You have no paycheck.
We need this deal.
JOHN: Berry,
  why aren't you saying much?
Why are you so hesitant?
'cause I think I'm the reason
  that she's not saying yes.
Why? Why not?
  why isn't she
  saying yes?
Because I believe
  in our company.
I think we are gonna be
  a $5 million company.
And if we're giving someone
  this 20% stake right now,
it's a huge, huge part
  of our business.
I don't want to push you
  into anything.
If you're not comfortable
  with this deal, don't take it.
I'm taking a chance on you
  because I believed in you.
A bigger chance, now,
  than you thought.
This is about money.
  make a decision.
What do you want to do?
Let's try it.
Okay.
All right.
  Lori, you have a deal!
Oh. All right. Good.
[ laughs ]
  [ sighs ]
Berry, you have to get
  on the train.
  let's do this!
I'm on the train.
  all right.
  good. Good.
Bye. Thank you.
  HERJAVEC:
  Good luck, guys.
Berry, ask for a paycheck.
We got it! Yes!
Lori,
  we are gonna do this!
WANLESS: I think I was
  a little hesitant at first
because we do
  value our company a lot
and we do anticipate
  huge sales.
But I do think,
  at the end of the day,
  it was the right deal
and that Lori's gonna be
  fantastic, a fantastic partner.
We're really excited
  about that.
NARRATOR: In season 2,
Kimberly Nelson made a deal
  with Barbara Corcoran
for her homemade-cake business,
  Daisy Cakes.
What do you think?
  Do we have a deal?
Of course.
Whew!
Let's see what she's doing now.
Daisy Cakes has gone through
  some major changes
since my last update.
On my last update, we moved
  all the baking out of state
to a large-production bakery.
It seemed like the only way
  to meet the demand
and keep my customers happy.
For a few months,
  everything was good.
And then things just started
  to spiral downward.
We made a couple
  of really poor hiring decisions,
and the quality of the cakes
  was so bad,
we lost nearly $150,000
  in bad product.
The worst part is,
that damaged our reputation
  with our most loyal customers.
We take a lot of pride
in these Daisy Cakes
  being made the right way.
So, with some really good
  words of advice from Barbara,
we decided to bring
  the Daisy Cakes baking back here
to Pauline, South Carolina,
  where it started.
So, how are y'all doing
  on these? You got enough?
We're back to basics here,
and I've hired
  a great team of employees.
And I learned
  a really big lesson --
that's that nobody's gonna make
  a Daisy cake
the way my mom and I
  are gonna make a Daisy cake.
CORCORAN: I knew I'd be
  finding you hard at work!
Come on!
  show me the operation!
  oh, my God!
Barbara has been
  a tremendous support,
and her guidance has been just
  what we needed for Daisy Cakes.
Our projected sales
  for Daisy Cakes
over the next year
  should be close to $3 million.
Let me tell you something.
  we're just getting started.
CORCORAN:
  When you're growing a business,
it's a series of mistakes that
  you have to learn to overcome.
Kim has the magic ingredient
  of every great entrepreneur.
When she gets hit,
  she pops right back up.
And that's why Kim is succeeding
  again at Daisy Cakes.
NELSON: Just because
  you get a deal on "Shark Tank"
doesn't mean
  it's going to be an easy road.
But with Barbara by my side,
I know the future
  for Daisy Cakes has no limits.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is an accomplished entrepreneur
from San Diego, California,
  with a simple way to stay fit.
Hello, sharks.
