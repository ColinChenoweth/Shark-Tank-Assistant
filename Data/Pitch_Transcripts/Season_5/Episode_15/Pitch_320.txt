Hi. My name
  is Susan Petersen.
The name of my company
  is Freshly Picked.
HERJAVEC: Susan,
  how do you sell them today?
Strictly through
  our e-commerce site.
Susan, what's your profit
  on the $500,000?
$120,000.
How many pairs is the most
  active buyer buying from you?
Okay,
  that's a good question.
$500,000?!
All my questions are good,
  Susan.
That's why they call me
  "Mr. Wonderful."
Kevin, your face
  is on my pillow at night.
I've gone to bed --
  yeah!
I love you.
  whoa!
Keep it up,
  I'll drop the royalty rate.
All right.
  answer that question, please.
PETERSEN: Okay, wait.
So, out of all of our customers
  that have made one purchase,
50% of them have come back
So, Susan,
  $500,000 in sales.
Tell me how much money
you've put into the company
  when you started.
So, when I first started,
  I didn't have any money.
Susan, let me just say --
  your story
So, Susan, like mark said,
  very impressive.
I have a saying
  that I always tell people --
"sales trumps all."
I mean, wow!
$500,000 --
  you got it going on.
I just -- I can't add anything
  to the baby-shoe business.
I don't think
  I'm the right partner for you.
I'm out.
You have what it takes
Susan has a partial offer
  from Kevin
but needs Daymond
  to join in on the offer.
Susan, I say I give you
  the $150,000 for 25%
Susan, why are you
  not dealing with Daymond?
I -- I -- I was gonna --
  I -- Daymond.
I -- you're actually --
  you're my dream shark.
Will you do $150,000
  for 20%?
I'm gonna give you
  the respect of who you are
Susan,
  one thing, though.
  yes.
When you sell the company
  one day for $100 million,
you're gonna cry
  on my pillow
for the $25 million
  you're gonna give him.
Kevin, I love you,
  but I don't think
I can give away
  any percentage of my profit.
Susan, $150,000, 25%
  from Daymond.
You got to make
  a decision.
When I go to New York next time,
  can I come see your office?
You will have a space
  in my office.
How about that?
  we have a deal.
Yay!
All right.
I love it.
  you are a tough cookie.
  GREINER:
  Nice deal. Congrats, Susan.
I'm so excited
  to work with you!
Thank you for letting me be
  a part of your dream.
This is amazing.
  thank you.
Congrats.
Great job, Susan.
Thank you.
Great deal.
All right.
  I liked that one.
Good job.
PETERSEN: I'm really excited
  to work with Daymond
because he knows manufacturing,
  he knows retail.
He's just
  the perfect combination for me.
It's gonna be
  a beautiful marriage.
