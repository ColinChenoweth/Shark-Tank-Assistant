My name is Phil Black,
  and my company is Fitdeck.
Okay. So, Phil, here's where
  it doesn't add up for me.
Let's assume you did $700,000
  two years ago in sales.
Your cost of goods on that
  would've been $100,000, right?
That leaves you
  with $600,000.
You made $100,000.
  that leaves you with $500,000.
You're spending $500,000
  running a $700,000 company?
Where's the money going?
To some r&amp;d --
  we have to create them.
It's going to making videos.
  we made 100 videos last year.
We redid the entire website.
O'LEARY: Phil, my greatest fear
  for this content
is that when it moves online
  or into an app,
it's simply free.
I mean, if you just Google
  these stretches,
there's a ton of content
  that's there for free.
Well, the problem with that is
  it's so all over the place
that if you wanted to do it --
  you could type in
"stretching exercises
  for a bad hamstring" --
you're gonna get
  15 million responses.
Which bank was it, Phil?
It was Goldman Sachs.
  no kidding.
Ah!
  oh, my God.
  so, hang on. Hang on.
You -- you have a degree
  from Yale.
Phil, it's, like,
  a heck of a story, but...
Why cards?
  cards?!
  trading cards, you know?
Why the cards?
  it just doesn't add up.
I-i-i-it's a simple solution.
CUBAN:
  Phil, it's interesting.
Honestly, with your background,
  it's kind of a disconnect
that you go from there
  to trading cards,
but you've done
  a great job of it.
To sell 4 million,
  that's amazing.
What is a problem
  is you recognize
you're gonna have to go
  into the mobile side of things.
Yes.
It is the most brutal business
  in the world.
Phil, you're an m.B.A.
  investment banker
at Goldman Sachs.
  Yale/Harvard graduate.
You've put a value on
  this business of $1.5 million.
Come on! I mean, you know
  it's not worth $1.5 million now.
It doesn't make enough money
  to value that.
Well, I think it does.
I think we have
  a great library of content,
I get that, but you --
  40 different titles.
We've got cash flow.
We have a great name --
  Fitdeck, fitness deck.
It's a great name.
Phil, do you --
  [ laughter ]
Somebody
  pepper-spray this guy.
Do you do this --
  do you do this full time?
Yes. This is
  our primary source of income.
Fitdeck must work.
  I've got four kids.
JOHN: Phil, let me bring
  some clarity.
  okay.
You know, Goldman Sachs,
  Harvard, Yale, a seal, Fitdeck.
I'm so impressed,
  I probably want to do the
  deal just 'cause of you.
I probably will get a financial
  advisor, a Professor,
Phil, I'm with you
  on the cards.
It's a pretty good idea.
Phil, if you think
  they're gonna migrate,
  you're lying to yourself.
You know, Phil,
  I think you're amazing.
I love your passion.
I like the simplicity
  of the card,
because, sometimes,
  I think we get too device-y.
But I think
  it's really difficult
to compete
  in this market.
When you go online,
  there's just so many
different offerings
  for exercises.
For me, I don't think it's
  the right business to invest in.
So I'm out.
HERJAVEC:
  who's left?
I think
  Mr. Wonderful is the last,
and I got to tell you
  something, Phil.
I've been sitting in the
  Shark Tank for many years now,
listening
  to a lot of pitches,
Phil, your r?šsum?š
  is very impressive --
perhaps the best we've ever seen
  on "Shark Tank."
I'm not kidding.
It does not equate
  to a deck of cards.
You are destined for
  much greater things than this.
I'm giving you a free pass
to come back through the doors
  with the next idea,
Phil, thanks.
Thank you
  for your time, Phil.
  thank you.
It's a pleasure
  to meet you.
Thank you. Likewise.
GREINER:
  nice to meet you.
They weren't really
  buying into the vision
