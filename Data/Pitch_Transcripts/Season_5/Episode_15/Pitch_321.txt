Hi. My name
  is Susan Petersen.
The name of my company
  is Freshly Picked.
And I'm asking for $150,000
  for 10%.
Freshly picked is
  the world's best baby moccasin.
When my second child, Gus,
  was born,
I looked everywhere
  for this type of shoe.
Soft soles are
  actually better for babies
that are learning to walk
because they can flex their toes
  with every step,
and this promotes balance.
I couldn't find the shoe
  that I was looking for,
so I decided to try my hand
  at making one.
I had a bag of scrap leather
that I'd gotten
  from a garage sale,
and I taught myself how to sew.
I worked through
  six different designs
until I landed on one
  that fit the bill.
Let me show you
  how amazing my moccasins are.
These are gonna remind you
  of your days on the track.
GREINER: Adorable.
Stay golden.
Oh, thank you.
  they're so cute.
Thank you.
  'cause I like your heart.
And for your team.
HERJAVEC:
  they're beautiful.
Yeah, really cute.
Where do you make these?
I started out making these
  all by myself.
Two years ago, I hired
  a local girl to help me,
and then we also get them made
  in California, as well.
HERJAVEC: Susan,
  how do you sell them today?
Strictly through
  our e-commerce site.
And what are
  your sales?
$500,000.
$500,000?!
That's a big number.
  this year.
GREINER: Wow!
  wow!
  O'LEARY: This year?
Good for you.
Susan, what's your profit
  on the $500,000?
$120,000.
How many pairs is the most
  active buyer buying from you?
Okay,
  that's a good question.
$500,000?!
All my questions are good,
  Susan.
That's why they call me
  "Mr. Wonderful."
Kevin, your face
  is on my pillow at night.
I've gone to bed --
  yeah!
I love you.
  whoa!
Keep it up,
  I'll drop the royalty rate.
All right.
  answer that question, please.
PETERSEN: Okay, wait.
So, out of all of our customers
  that have made one purchase,
50% of them have come back
and bought
  at least three more times.
That's very impressive.
Can a baby easily
  just pull it off?
No. That's the thing.
The elastic keeps it
  around their ankle.
So, Susan,
  $500,000 in sales.
Tell me how much money
you've put into the company
  when you started.
So, when I first started,
  I didn't have any money.
My husband was in school,
  and we were really, really poor.
My brother owns
  a window-installation business,
and so I convinced him
  one summer
to give me all the old windows
  he took out.
And I spent the whole summer
  out there during that time
in the heat banging the glass
  out of those windows,
'cause they're aluminum-frame.
I took those frames
  to the scrapyard
at the end of the summer,
  and I got $200.
And I was able to buy
  one hide of leather,
which makes
  about 40 moccasins.
That's really great.
And then I just continually
  put it back in.
And that's why we had
  kind of a slow start.
That literally
  is the best story
to start a company
  I've ever heard.
How much
  do these sell for?
I don't think
  we got a price point.
$60 retail.
  $60 a pair?
60 bucks?
  uh-huh.
And what do you
  make them for?
We're at about $17,
  'cause we're still domestic.
What's the projection
  for next year?
I think with
  just my social media alone,
I can do
  between $2- and $3 million.
That's a lot
  of baby shoes.
I am gaining about 1,500 new
  followers on Instagram a week,
and we've found that
  about 10% of our Instagram buy.
And do you have retailers
  that are customers?
Any brick and mortar?
We have a lot of retailers
  that are interested,
but I can't keep up
  with the demand.
I need the money
  to make a big order overseas.
This next year,
  my vision for the company
is to start
  moving into retail.
I'm just wondering --
  how in love with retail are you?
Because it's a very tough
  business on the inventory side.
I really -- I want to --
I want to build
  a big, big, big company.
But you want to make money.
  you're right.
Retail's like a siren
  on an ancient ship,
drawing the sailors towards her
  and then drowning them.
That's what happens.
  it's true.
And I've seen it happen
  many, many times.
They take your capital.
They put your product
  in the store.
  they get paid, plus 30 days.
Susan, let me just say --
  your story
of taking the windows
  and pulling out the aluminum
should be
  in every business book,
should be
  in every entrepreneur's guide.
You personify
  the American dream
of saying,
  "get off my butt,
and let's go out there
  and get it done."
thank you, mark.
Now, that said, right,
I'm not the guy
  for the baby-shoes world.
I'd be learning from you more
  than you'd be learning from me.
I can't respect you enough,
  but I have to say I'm out.
Okay.
So, Susan, like mark said,
  very impressive.
I have a saying
  that I always tell people --
"sales trumps all."
I mean, wow!
$500,000 --
  you got it going on.
I just -- I can't add anything
  to the baby-shoe business.
I don't think
  I'm the right partner for you.
I'm out.
You have what it takes
to make a great business
  and to run your business.
I actually think that
  you'll be better on your own.
So, for that reason,
  I'm out.
How many pairs do you think
  you're gonna sell in a year?
Next year?
  yeah.
Between 25,000 to 30,000.
So, if you feel
  you're gonna do that --
which is more than awesome,
  it's amazing --
why do you feel
  you need the $150,000?
Why take on a partner?
Well,
  I haven't been to school.
This is my first business,
and I have been burned
  a couple times.
And I really --
  I -- I love advice.
No one ever
  has to do the work for me.
As shown, I will do it.
But I need help
  with manufacturing.
That's a big one for me.
I don't want
  10% of a company.
That's just -- it doesn't
  get me up in the morning.
I mean,
  that's just not enough
for all the headaches
  you're gonna be.
I -- I am not a headache.
Business is always
  full of headaches. Trust me.
But you have
  high margins.
So, I'm gonna set up
  a rather crafty way of doing it.
You have to get $150,000,
and in this deal,
I need this guy
  more than he needs me.
But I bring a lot
  to the table
in terms of making you
  bigger than you are.
I'll give you $75,000,
and the way I would structure it
  is -- no equity.
Don't want any.
I want a royalty.
I'd like to do a royalty
  of 7%
until my $75,000 comes back,
and then drop it down to 5%.
And you can well afford that,
  actually.
You have to give her
  $150,000, kev.
No, but I only have $75,000,
  unfortunately.
I wonder
  if anybody else has $75,000.
So, that means, Daymond,
  you have to give her $75,000.
NARRATOR:
  three sharks are out.
Susan has a partial offer
  from Kevin
but needs Daymond
  to join in on the offer.
Susan, I say I give you
  the $150,000 for 25%
and we tell this bozo
  to take a walk.
Ooh.
25%.
  wow. That's expensive.
I'm 25% of a partnership
  with you,
and I'll help you
  with everything.
That's a lot of equity.
This is a real debate
  for you, now.
It really is.
  no, it's not.
Kevin, I really thank you
  for your offer, but I think
at this point in my business,
  where I want to grow to,
I don't think it's smart
  for me to give you 7%.
What would you give me
  if I kept my equity at zero?
Tell him to take a walk
  and let's do this.
I would give you a kiss.
Ohh!
  yeah!
  what?!
That -- that is cheap.
  that's cheap.
  that's what's in it for me --
  a kiss?
Tell him to take a walk.
  why are you not dealing
  with Daymond?
Susan, why are you
  not dealing with Daymond?
I -- I -- I was gonna --
  I -- Daymond.
I -- you're actually --
  you're my dream shark.
Will you do $150,000
  for 20%?
I'm gonna give you
  the respect of who you are
because of what you've done
  and what you've accomplished.
I normally would want 1/3.
I would like to stay
  at 25%.
So, $150,000 for 25%
  values my company at $600,000,
which is almost
  what I've done this year.
I think next month,
  I'll hit that mark.
But you're
  my dream investor.
It's six times your profits.
  it's six times your profit.
It's not -- it's not what
  I'm valuing your company at.
Yeah.
  it's what
  I'm valuing my time at.
'cause when you put in
  the valuation,
if we were
  just purely doing valuation,
that means
  I just write you $150,000
and I look in my mailbox every
  quarter and I don't help you.
Susan,
  one thing, though.
  yes.
When you sell the company
  one day for $100 million,
you're gonna cry
  on my pillow
for the $25 million
  you're gonna give him.
Kevin, I love you,
  but I don't think
I can give away
  any percentage of my profit.
Susan, $150,000, 25%
  from Daymond.
You got to make
  a decision.
When I go to New York next time,
  can I come see your office?
You will have a space
  in my office.
How about that?
  we have a deal.
Yay!
All right.
I love it.
  you are a tough cookie.
  GREINER:
  Nice deal. Congrats, Susan.
I'm so excited
  to work with you!
Thank you for letting me be
  a part of your dream.
This is amazing.
  thank you.
Congrats.
Great job, Susan.
Thank you.
Great deal.
All right.
  I liked that one.
Good job.
PETERSEN: I'm really excited
  to work with Daymond
because he knows manufacturing,
  he knows retail.
He's just
  the perfect combination for me.
It's gonna be
  a beautiful marriage.
