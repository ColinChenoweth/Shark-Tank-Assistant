My name is Daryl Stevenett,
HERJAVEC:
  Daryl, how many calories
  are in each capsule?
There's a little bit of sugar
  in each one,
but the calories are not there
  so you can live on it.
The calories are there
  to help drive the nutrients
right into your bloodstream.
All right.
  so, I read this bottle.
  mm-hmm.
Daryl, are you
  selling this today?
In five years,
  we've done $440,000.
All you have to say --
"Hey, I took it for eight days,
  lost a pound a day,"
Daryl,
  I want to buy you --
but, Daryl,
  I have a big question.
Is this FDA-approved?
Of course not.
  no supplement company wants --
the FDA does not approve dietary
  supplements -- only drugs.
This is FDA 100% compliant.
Yeah,
  because it's nothing!
You are
  such a snake-oil salesperson.
If you do nothing,
  it's FDA-compliant.
Mark, I challenge you
  to go eight days without food!
Daryl, Daryl, you knew
that you'd run across
  a guy like mark.
You had the sales.
  you had the money.
Why didn't you get
  some clinical tests done?
Well, I think
  maybe it's time to do it.
I look at the last five years
  as a test market.
O'LEARY:
  so, I'm gonna suspend belief
  for a second
STEVENETT:
  I really appreciate all of you,
