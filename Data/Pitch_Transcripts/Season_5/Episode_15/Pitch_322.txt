My name is Phil Black,
  and my company is Fitdeck.
And I'm seeking $300,000
in exchange
  for 20% of the company.
Fitdeck is a custom deck
  of fitness playing cards
that makes exercise more simple,
  convenient, and fun.
Each card has an illustration
and instructions
  on how to perform the exercise.
So all you need to do
  is shuffle, deal, and go.
Can we see a package?
Sure.
And where are you
  selling them?
Primarily from our website,
  direct to consumer.
That's about 75%
  of our business.
So, why don't you take
  Fitdeck body weight?
HERJAVEC: Thank you.
This is cross training,
  Daymond,
thank you.
  our equivalent to crossfit.
Thank you.
And, of course, mark --
  Fitdeck basketball.
Appreciate that.
So, sharks,
  who's ready to go all-in?
HERJAVEC: Okay,
  walk me through a single unit.
What do you sell it for?
  what does it cost to make?
That sells for $14.95
  on our website.
It costs about $2 to make.
Are you selling
  a lot of these cards right now?
We have sold a half a million
  of these Fitdecks.
Wow!
  what?!
  in how long
  a period of time?
That's been
  over the last seven years or so.
Ohh.
  the majority of those have been
  in the last four years or so.
Well, how many
  did you sell last year?
Last year,
  we sold 55,000.
So, how many dollars
  is that?
Last year, $640,000.
Very impressive.
  what was your profit?
Last year,
  the profit was a break-even.
Why? How could you
  only break even?
HERJAVEC:
  there's something missing.
You got to be making
  a ton of money.
Or you got screwed
  somewhere along the line.
Well, last year
  was an anomaly.
The prior years, we had
  an average of $725,000 in sales
with an average profit
  of about $120,000.
So, when your sales dropped,
  your profit was wiped out?
Correct.
Okay. So, Phil, here's where
  it doesn't add up for me.
Let's assume you did $700,000
  two years ago in sales.
Your cost of goods on that
  would've been $100,000, right?
That leaves you
  with $600,000.
You made $100,000.
  that leaves you with $500,000.
You're spending $500,000
  running a $700,000 company?
Where's the money going?
To some r&amp;d --
  we have to create them.
It's going to making videos.
  we made 100 videos last year.
We redid the entire website.
O'LEARY: Phil, my greatest fear
  for this content
is that when it moves online
  or into an app,
it's simply free.
I mean, if you just Google
  these stretches,
there's a ton of content
  that's there for free.
Well, the problem with that is
  it's so all over the place
that if you wanted to do it --
  you could type in
"stretching exercises
  for a bad hamstring" --
you're gonna get
  15 million responses.
And we're breaking it down
  for you to make it very simple.
What would you like
  the $300,000 for?
The $300,000 is gonna amount
to where we think
  the future of the business is.
So 75% to 80% of that, we feel
  is going on the digital side.
You're planning
  to sell that app?
  correct.
CUBAN:
  that's a tough business.
  we've been selling that app
for the last --
  that's a very tough space.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
  you've been selling --
  you have an app?
We've been selling it
  for about four or five months.
We're getting
  1,000 downloads a month
with very little marketing.
It's all free
  at that point, right?
No, we sell this
  for $9.99.
How did you come up with this?
  tell us about your background.
I was a Navy Seal
  for almost six years.
CUBAN: You were?
  yes.
Oh! All right. Thank you.
  good for you.
Yeah, well, actually,
  the idea for Fitdeck
was based on a card game that I
  played with my college roommates
at Yale University.
And it was a game called "pug,"
  short for "push-up game."
now, this became
  a campus-wide sensation at Yale.
You know,
  it made an impression on me.
I graduated from Yale,
and I went to one of the biggest
  investment banks in the world
for about 2 1/2 years.
Which bank was it, Phil?
It was Goldman Sachs.
  no kidding.
Ah!
  oh, my God.
  so, hang on. Hang on.
You -- you have a degree
  from Yale.
You were an investment banker,
  and that wasn't enough,
so then
  you were a Navy Seal.
I came to my senses after
  the investment banking
  and became a seal.
So, now you're flying around
  the world doing crazy stuff.
  HERJAVEC:
  okay, and then what happened?
Well, while I was flying
  around the world,
we had every fitness product
  and program in the world
at our fingertips,
  and guess what we played.
Pug?
  we played the pug game!
I left, and I went
  to Harvard business school.
And there --
  [ laughter ]
HERJAVEC: Okay! Stop!
All that training --
  you came up with cards?!
Exactly!
So, finish the story.
So, I said,
  "why stop at push-ups?
"why not take this pug concept
and create a business
  out of it -- Fitdeck?"
we can attack all things --
  not just body-weight exercises,
but yoga, pilates, stretching,
  crossfit, basketball.
HERJAVEC:
  how old are you?!
Are you like 58? How could
  you have time to do all that?
I'm 43.
  most of this was done --
I have four kids, too, so they
  keep me pretty busy, as well.
[ laughs ]
  and a dog.
Phil, it's, like,
  a heck of a story, but...
Why cards?
  cards?!
  trading cards, you know?
Why the cards?
  it just doesn't add up.
I-i-i-it's a simple solution.
You understand the idea
  of milking it now...
Yes.
  if you've already got
  the infrastructure.
I don't know
  how long this lasts,
but you could probably pull a
  couple million bucks out of it.
That's what I'm hoping to do,
  Kevin. That's why I'm here.
CUBAN:
  Phil, it's interesting.
Honestly, with your background,
  it's kind of a disconnect
that you go from there
  to trading cards,
but you've done
  a great job of it.
To sell 4 million,
  that's amazing.
What is a problem
  is you recognize
you're gonna have to go
  into the mobile side of things.
Yes.
It is the most brutal business
  in the world.
There are
  hundreds of thousands of apps,
and probably hundreds
  of thousands minus 1,000
have gone out of business.
I just don't see that
  as being an equitable outcome.
[ chuckles ] Right? I just
  don't see the future there.
And so, for that reason,
  I'm out.
Phil, you're an m.B.A.
  investment banker
at Goldman Sachs.
  Yale/Harvard graduate.
You've put a value on
  this business of $1.5 million.
Come on! I mean, you know
  it's not worth $1.5 million now.
It doesn't make enough money
  to value that.
Well, I think it does.
I think we have
  a great library of content,
I get that, but you --
  40 different titles.
We've got cash flow.
We have a great name --
  Fitdeck, fitness deck.
It's a great name.
We have the story. We have
  authenticity. We have a brand.
And you're a Navy Seal!
Exactly!
And lastly, if there's one thing
  that I think all of us share...
What?
  ...We can fight.
Robert,
  I know you can fight.
Lori, I know you can fight.
Kevin, I know you can fight.
  Daymond, I know can fight.
Is anyone gonna argue
  that Mark Cuban can fight?
Guess what --
  I can fight, too!
  yeah, but I fight for me.
  I can fight for me.
I can fight for you!
  I ain't fighting for you.
Someone wants to
  come after my business, Kevin,
and take the food out of
  my kids' mouths, I will fight!
  whoa.
Whoo!
  you guys want to join me?
  we'll all fight!
Phil, do you --
  [ laughter ]
Somebody
  pepper-spray this guy.
Do you do this --
  do you do this full time?
Yes. This is
  our primary source of income.
Fitdeck must work.
  I've got four kids.
JOHN: Phil, let me bring
  some clarity.
  okay.
You know, Goldman Sachs,
  Harvard, Yale, a seal, Fitdeck.
I'm so impressed,
  I probably want to do the
  deal just 'cause of you.
I probably will get a financial
  advisor, a Professor,
a bodyguard, and a trainer
  all at the same time.
All right!
  [ laughter ]
um, you know,
  it's amazing.
But, you know, applications --
  it's the new gold rush.
Everybody with a computer
  believes they have one.
You know, the money you have to
  spend to keep this current,
I just don't know if I can help
  you and I think it's worth it.
You have a --
I -- [ sighs ]
I'm out.
Phil, I'm with you
  on the cards.
It's a pretty good idea.
Where you and I digress
is there's something wrong
  in the business.
You're selling 700,000
for a product where your margin
  is unbelievable,
and you can't make money
  at it.
Very impressive story.
  thank you for your service.
But I'm out.
You -- as a technology person,
  you know,
the fact that we have
  500,000 decks out there,
that we can move people over
  and migrate them --
Phil, if you think
  they're gonna migrate,
  you're lying to yourself.
You know, Phil,
  I think you're amazing.
I love your passion.
I like the simplicity
  of the card,
because, sometimes,
  I think we get too device-y.
But I think
  it's really difficult
to compete
  in this market.
When you go online,
  there's just so many
different offerings
  for exercises.
For me, I don't think it's
  the right business to invest in.
So I'm out.
HERJAVEC:
  who's left?
I think
  Mr. Wonderful is the last,
and I got to tell you
  something, Phil.
I've been sitting in the
  Shark Tank for many years now,
listening
  to a lot of pitches,
and I pretty well get it
  very quickly.
I don't get you.
Phil, your r?šsum?š
  is very impressive --
perhaps the best we've ever seen
  on "Shark Tank."
I'm not kidding.
It does not equate
  to a deck of cards.
You are destined for
  much greater things than this.
I'm giving you a free pass
to come back through the doors
  with the next idea,
and I think everybody else here
  would do the same.
This is not it.
  I'm out.
Phil, thanks.
Thank you
  for your time, Phil.
  thank you.
It's a pleasure
  to meet you.
Thank you. Likewise.
GREINER:
  nice to meet you.
They weren't really
  buying into the vision
and into the business,
and as a Navy Seal, I've swum
  with real sharks before.
And given the choice,
  I'd probably go back
to the real sharks
  and stay away from those guys.
NARRATOR: Next up
  is an entrepreneur with a pill
that he feels everyone
  should have just in case.
Hello, sharks.
