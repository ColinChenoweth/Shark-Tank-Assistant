My name is Daryl Stevenett,
and I've created a product
  called Life Caps.
I'm here
  seeking a $200,000 investment
in exchange
  for 30% of my company.
Now, sharks,
  can I ask you a question?
Do I look healthy?
Do I look mentally alert?
I haven't had any food
  for eight days.
[ chuckles ]
Life caps is
  a life-saving survival pill
that you can take
  in times of emergency
when food is not available.
Life caps satisfies hunger.
  I am not hungry.
Life caps provides nutrition.
  I am mentally alert.
I got the idea a few years ago
when I saw a story
  about coal miners
that were trapped underground
  in Southern Utah.
The rescue workers were drilling
  a 4-inch hole down 1,500 feet,
trying to get food and water
  down to the miners.
Then I thought, "why doesn't
  somebody come up with an idea
like a pill that could
  sustain life in an emergency?"
then I thought, "why not me?"
  I'm a musician.
I knew nothing about
  formulating a food product,
so I reached out to a friend
  of mine who had created
some of the top-selling
  energy bars in America.
And a few weeks later,
  Life Caps was born.
Life caps is perfect
  for any emergency situation,
such as earthquakes,
  tornados, hurricanes --
even campers, hikers, Hunters.
With your help, I feel we can
  get the word out to the masses
about this amazing new product
  and help a lot of people
become better prepared
  for the unexpected.
Thank you.
O'LEARY:
  Now, you didn't tell us
how long the shelf life is
  of this pill.
I have
  a five-year shelf life.
You really haven't eaten
  in eight days -- nothing?
Swear to God.
Just water and the pill?
This is nothing --
  I went 17 days,
and they put me on a show
  in Salt Lake City.
Four ladies were interviewing.
  they kept saying,
"Oh, my gosh!
  you must have lost weight!"
six, seven times.
  did you lose weight?
First of all,
  this is not a diet pill.
Yes, I've lost some weight.
And I think if you lose a little
  weight to save your life,
that's a small price to pay.
But the point is, these women
  were looking to you
and going,
  "hmm. diet aid." right?
Well, I know
  they were thinking that,
because there was
  a 10,000 viewership on the show.
It was 98% women.
And after I said that,
  we sold out.
We did $30,000 in sales.
HERJAVEC:
  did you have one every day?
I take a pill for breakfast,
  one for lunch, one for dinner,
and if I'm hungry at night,
  I'll take a snack.
[ pops lips ]
[ laughs ]
  Would you like to try it?
Yes!
Absolutely not. Could we see
  the packaging, though?
Mark, "absolutely not"?
Absolutely not!
Okay. Here you go.
Thank you.
HERJAVEC:
  Daryl, how many calories
  are in each capsule?
There's a little bit of sugar
  in each one,
but the calories are not there
  so you can live on it.
The calories are there
  to help drive the nutrients
right into your bloodstream.
All right.
  so, I read this bottle.
  mm-hmm.
And, basically,
  everything in here
is like what's in some
  of the vitamins that I take.
Isn't this just a vitamin?
There is a huge difference.
You know
  when bears hibernate,
they go seven months
  without food?
How do they do that?
  Bears don't die.
They buy Life Caps.
  [ laughter ]
when your body gets pure
  nutrition but zero calories,
it feels free
  to burn body fat.
I'm surviving right now
  on my own body fat.
That's how bears hibernate.
We've created
  a metabolic trigger
which allows the body to burn
  its own fat for stored energy.
How much weight did you lose
  in that eight days?
I burn a pound a day when I'm
  doing this, and nothing else.
8 pounds?
JOHN: Let me ask you
  something here.
At the end of the day, you want
  a bunch of people to say,
"I want to just not eat
  and take this instead."
No, that's not
  what I'm going for at all.
Well, how do I make money?
  well, then how do we
  make money? Yeah.
Because I'm gonna buy
  one pack. I don't need to
  buy another for five years.
CUBAN: You guys seriously
  are considering
looking at making money
  from this nonsense?
I want to know --
I'm just -- I want to know
  what he's thinking.
Daryl, are you
  selling this today?
In five years,
  we've done $440,000.
All you have to say --
"Hey, I took it for eight days,
  lost a pound a day,"
and everybody goes nuts.
If this was real,
you would be telling us about
  how you took it to doctors,
how you've had studies done.
I want to do
  a clinical study.
I didn't have the money
  to do it.
You have had
  $100,000 in sales.
  my doctor -- I went
  and got a checkup on my 13th --
my doctor looked at it.
You are so full of crap.
You keep on going back
  to all this nonsense, right?
Well, I haven't eaten
  for eight days.
I have no crap in me --
  trust me.
[ laughter ]
Daryl,
  I want to buy you --
but, Daryl,
  I have a big question.
Is this FDA-approved?
Of course not.
  no supplement company wants --
the FDA does not approve dietary
  supplements -- only drugs.
This is FDA 100% compliant.
Yeah,
  because it's nothing!
You are
  such a snake-oil salesperson.
If you do nothing,
  it's FDA-compliant.
Mark, I challenge you
  to go eight days without food!
Daryl, Daryl, you knew
that you'd run across
  a guy like mark.
You had the sales.
  you had the money.
Why didn't you get
  some clinical tests done?
Well, I think
  maybe it's time to do it.
I look at the last five years
  as a test market.
O'LEARY:
  so, I'm gonna suspend belief
  for a second
and forget about
  all the objections to this.
My biggest problem with it
is that I have to have
  a few of these
sitting on the shelf
  in case the zombies come.
[ laughs ]
The trouble is,
  I'm not buying any more
until the zombies come,
  so I just buy it once,
sits on my shelf
  waiting for zombies.
That's no good.
That's the problem.
  how do I make money?
That's the only problem?
Let's say this works.
  why are we talking
  about this?!
Look, I see why you came up
  with this angle.
No one can contest it.
If this truly worked,
  it'd be really, really easy
to take it to doctors
  and do studies.
But instead, you come here
  like a snake-oil salesperson
knowing that you're gonna prey
  on everybody watching
the minute you said
  you lose 1 pound per day
when you take this.
That's wrong.
I'm out, as Kevin says,
  with prejudice.
Mark, I agree.
  we backdoored the diet industry.
Like I said, I'm a musician.
I don't know
  all the ins and outs.
What have you been doing
  for five years?!
  you know what, though?
He's a hustler.
  I did a real-world study.
GREINER:
  Whenever somebody is selling
  something that you ingest,
you have to be
  a really responsible person
and make sure that what
  you're giving everybody is safe.
Doing the clinical trials
  and the studies
and all of that beforehand
  is really important.
You haven't done that.
I'm out.
Barbara,
  can I explain one thing?
I'm not Barbara.
  oh, excuse me -- Lori.
[ laughter ]
That mental thing
  is not holding up.
Whoops. Yeah.
That mental thing
  is not holding up.
HERJAVEC:
  you know, the problem is,
  people want a shortcut.
People don't want
  to put the discipline in
it takes to eat healthy
  and lose weight and so on.
So, a guy like you comes along,
  and people see a shortcut.
And they don't look
  behind the facade.
I think
  it's irresponsible.
I'm out.
You know, the presentation
  started off like steak.
It started to look like
  filet mignon.
But, as the other sharks
  pointed out,
no FDA approval, no research,
  no clinical trials.
The filet mignon,
  the steak,
just became
  a rotten pack of baloney.
I'm out.
CUBAN:
  And then there was one.
I'm just a guy
  trying to scratch out a living.
I ask myself, can I make
  any money investing in this?
And the answer is no.
I'm out.
STEVENETT:
  I really appreciate all of you,
and I appreciate
  what you're doing for people.
You're putting people to work,
  helping entrepreneurs.
It's an honor to meet you all.
  thank you.
Thank you.
  thank you.
CUBAN: He's such
  a snake-oil salesperson.
He's gonna go anywhere
  that there's an audience
and hope
  that somebody says yes.
I get slimy
  just thinking about him. Next!
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is a mom from Provo, Utah,
with a stylish and functional
  way to cover tiny feet.
