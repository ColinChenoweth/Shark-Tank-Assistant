Hello, sharks.
  my name is Bruno Francois.
My product is Cycloramic.
FRANCOIS: Okay.
I'm an inventor, too.
FRANCOIS: For any phone.
  for any phone.
Bruno, you know, I have
  an offer on the table.
Yeah, I apologize.
Are you interested
  to hear any other offers?
  I know that -- that --
or you just want to listen
  to her squawk?
I really like your offer.
Do you mind if I listen
  to everybody?
You know, just out of respect,
FRANCOIS: Mm-hmm.
I'll take a 15% royalty
only on the revenues
  of this application.
Okay.
I'm the only shark up here
that actually made a living
  as a photographer.
I'm gonna offer Bruno
  $250,000 for 10%.
Now...
  half mine, half yours.
JOHN:
  you're equaling my offer?
If that's a value
  to Bruno,
I think it's a better offer,
  okay?
He's got a lot
  of connections.
  FRANCOIS: Yes.
O'LEARY:
  You basically have two offers
for $250,000
  for 10% of the equity.
If you don't want
  to give up any equity,
I'm happy to partner with you
TISCH: Bruno, do you want
  two real partners?
Close your eyes,
  stop for a minute,
Are you done playing games
  with these guys, Bruno?
I'm gonna offer you
  $1 million...
Oh.
...For 30%.
That's more than
  a $3-million valuation.
It's a sweet deal!
NARRATOR: Bruno has four offers
  on the table --
Bruno, do not give up
  your equity.
I want to be able to decrease
  a little bit of the equity
for future investment.
  yeah.
But, you know,
  I don't want you to lower
the percent for nothing,
  so I'm giving something back.
CUBAN: How much money would you
  want out of that $1 million?
I wouldn't want to give away
  that much equity,
so probably $500,000
  would be...
Okay.
  so $500,000 for 16.5%.
So each of us would have
  8.25% for 250k.
It's a good deal.
  let's do it.
Come on. Close it.
  I think a better deal
  is I like my --
do you want to hear
  another offer...
  wait.
...Where you give up
  less equity?
Stop. Stop.
  because...
We were
  just about to close.
No, you weren't.
  JOHN: No, you weren't.
Sit down, Lori.
But can you
  just come down?
I mean, I'm really close
  to making a deal,
but 15% seems like...
  TISCH: Bruno,
  we've got a...
So at 15% -- Lori...
Bruno, you got to
  make up your mind.
You've got a deal.
Deal. Yeah.
  yay!
Awesome. [ laughs ]
  it's gonna be great.
Congratulations.
  all right, thank you.
Looking forward to it.
  all right.
Congratulations, though.
  TISCH: Bruno,
  congratulations.
Thank you very much.
  GREINER: Thank you.
Thanks, Bruno.
  all right.
FRANCOIS: 15% is a little more
  than what I came for,
but I got a higher valuation,
