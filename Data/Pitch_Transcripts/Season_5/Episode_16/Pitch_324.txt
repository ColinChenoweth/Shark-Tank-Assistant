I'm Joan.
  and I'm Julia.
BOTH: And we're sisters
  from Normal, Illinois.
Growing up in a family of seven,
  everything was homemade.
Baking is practically
  in our blood.
We've been baking since we've
  been little girls with our mom
in the kitchen
  and haven't stopped.
Let's go eat.
We've developed
  the perfect alternative
to one of America's
  guiltiest pleasures.
It's gourmet,
  it's delicious,
and there's nothing like it
  on the market.
[ both laugh ]
Working together as sisters
  is fun.
I'm the boss.
  no, you're not.
  yeah, I am.
Neither of us are the boss.
  we're partners.
We are partners, but most
  of the time, I am the boss.
Okay. A little room.
Our facility is
  the world's tiniest kitchen.
Getting an investment
  would put us into a place
where we can actually have
  a production.
Americans are gonna love our
  product because it's unique
and it's a sweet treat
  that everyone can enjoy.
We want to be
  in mass production,
and we want to become
  a national brand,
and we need the sharks
  to help us do that.
Hi. I'm Joan Pacetti.
And I'm Julia Schmid.
  and we're sisters.
And together
  we own...
BOTH:
  ...The Cookie Dough Cafe.
We are seeking $50,000
  for 20% of our company.
Anyone who has ever baked
  homemade cookies
knows how tempting
  the cookie dough can be.
It's gooey. It's sweet.
  it's sinful.
But we all know we should not be
  sneaking bites of cookie dough.
We've heard about raw eggs
  and salmonella,
and every pre-packaged
  cookie dough has labels
saying, "warning --
  do not eat raw."
even though we know this,
  we still swipe by the spoonful.
That's why we created
  a safe, edible cookie dough
that is strictly made for
  eating, indulging, and enjoying.
Yes!
Don't bother
  preheating your oven.
You can enjoy our product
  straight from the jar.
SCHMID:
  this is the real deal.
This is your mama's
  cookie dough.
It's creamy,
loaded full
  of chocolate chips,
delicious candies, real butter,
  and no added preservatives.
We have the only gourmet, edible
  cookie dough on the market
specifically made
  to consume as is.
We have hand-packed thousands
  of pints of cookie dough
in the world's
  tiniest kitchen.
We need your help.
So grab a spoon
  and dig right in.
Yes!
  hey! [ laughs ]
you get the Oreo,
  Steve.
And Lori gets
  the chocolate chip.
Whoa!
Now, what is stopping salmonella
  from growing in this?
It contains no eggs
  whatsoever.
Hmm.
GREINER:
  oh, this is great.
  thank you.
  thank you.
This tastes so good.
  what does this pint sell for?
$6.99 is what
  it retails for.
And what do you
  make it for?
  $2.20.
Can you also bake cookies
  with this, or no?
BOTH: You can.
But they'll just be
  really flat because
  there's no baking soda.
And they don't taste as good
  baked without the eggs.
And you've been in business
  how long?
A little over a year.
How are the sales?
Our sales to date
  are $24,000.
What were your sales
  last month?
Last month, they were
  probably $1,600.
1,600 units or $1,600?
Dollars.
Yes.
$1,600?
  we were
  in seven stores.
Seven stores.
  we just --
we got a purchase order
  last week
for more than what
  we've sold all year.
It's gonna put us
  in an additional
50 fresh market
  grocery stores.
Your purchase order was for how
  much money and how many units?
2,300 pints. And we'll make
  about $6,000 on it.
GREINER: What's your mode
  of selling?
How are you trying to get
  your product out there?
We don't do any marketing
  or anything like that. Um --
how are you getting into
  the grocery stores, though?
'cause that's very hard.
  we approached
  the fresh market.
Yeah, we went and talked to
  the manager in normal, Illinois.
He looked at our packaging.
  he tasted our product.
And he was like,
  "this is gonna be huge."
and how much has he sold --
  has that one store sold?
$11,000 of our sales
  last year.
Over a year?
  in just one store.
Do you really think,
  in one store,
a product that only does $11,000
  can stay on the shelf?
It's $900 a month.
Who cares?
Now, stop it.
But, I mean,
  think about it.
If you could get
  that year back
and you never had
  this nightmare, would you --
shut up, Kevin.
  Kevin!
Are you kidding?
How much
  have you invested?
$35,000 total.
  total.
What are you gonna do
  with the $50,000?
Purchase equipment that'll help
  automate the packing process
'cause that's the most
  time-consuming part
of our job
  right now.
What are you guys doing now
  to make a living?
Is this all you're doing?
I'm an agent at
  an R.V. Dealership.
  okay.
And I'm
  a stay-at-home mom.
We come from a family
  of entrepreneurs.
Our dad literally swept
  the floor in a factory
and started
  his own business.
Unfortunately,
  he's passed away,
but one of our older brothers
  took over the business,
and it's a multimillion-dollar
  business now.
How come your brother hasn't
  helped you with the $50,000?
We haven't asked.
Why?
  I don't know.
Sense of pride? I mean...
  [ chuckles ] yeah.
I get that.
We're here, obviously,
  for the $50,000,
but we also need
  some connections,
like getting our product
  in a manufacturing facility.
We don't know
  how to do that.
JOHN: That leads me
  to my next statement.
I love it.
If you do this deal,
  I'm gonna add egg to yours.
But it's so early
  at this point.
I would have to do
  way more work.
I would have to ask you
  for so much of the company
that it would be unfair.
I wouldn't have the time
  to help you.
I'm a customer
  but not an investor.
I'm out.
I like what you guys are doing.
  it tastes great.
But to Daymond's point,
you're still in that early,
  early, early stage,
and you're gonna
  be turning to us
because you don't want to
  have to go through this blindly.
That's the whole point
  of coming here, right?
And so that creates
  a lot of work for us.
But don't you think
  that's good, too?
We don't have
  $1 million in sales
and we're not in here
  asking you for $500,000?
Can't you see this
  in stadiums...
  oh, absolutely.
...And theaters and
  single cookie-dough cups?
Yeah, in some respects,
  you're right.
But it's too early.
And so for that reason,
  I'm out.
O'LEARY: My big problem with
  this is the proof of concept.
You've practically
  sold nothing.
I don't think this is
  going to be a big product.
I really don't.
When we just got
  50 additional stores?
You would give up
  when you just went
from 7 stores to 50
  in a week?
I mean, look, I don't want
  to insult you --
Kevin sees the word "dough,"
  and he gets confused.
I don't want you to pursue
  the path to hell on Earth.
It's a hobby that eventually
should be taken behind the barn
  and shot.
I hate it.
I'm out.
NARRATOR:
  three sharks are out.
Julia and Joan have only two
  chances left to make a deal.
We've had people approach us,
  and we can't get
to that next step because
  we weren't with a distributor.
We've had Walgreens
  call us up.
We had everything finalized
  to be in their flagship stores
like you have in Hollywood,
  downtown Chicago.
How did you
  get into Walgreens?
They
  approached us.
They saw
  our product...
  where?
...On the fresh market shelf
  and called us up.
Because we weren't with
  a distributor they used --
you know,
  we're not big enough yet,
they said,
  "call us when you get in."
so that door is still open,
  you think?
Oh, yeah.
  it's still -- I talked
  to her two weeks ago.
You know, I remember what
  it was like to be just like you.
I don't agree with Mark.
  I don't mind doing hard work.
And you don't mind
  doing hard work.
  no, I don't.
So I think
  we'll put our heads together,
do a lot of hard work,
  and get it out there everywhere.
But I also was sitting here
  thinking, when you said,
"it would be good in stadiums."
I've got a guy next to me.
  he's got some stadiums, himself.
I think it's a great product
  for stadiums.
I've also got great contacts
  in hotels.
I think this in a hotel room --
  slam dunk.
Would you want
  to partner with me?
Go 50/50?
Yes, and you get two sharks
  with different contacts,
different connections,
  different opportunities.
We like that.
We like that. Yeah.
  GREINER: It's a lot.
How about we give you $100,000
  for a 30% stake?
I think we should offer $100,000
  for 40%.
Okay.
And we see this also paired
  with a large ice cream --
guys, guys!
  that is a sweet deal.
What are you gonna do?
  did you hear
  what they said?
It's a lot of dough
  for your dough.
I would rather do
  the $50,000.
I would rather do $50,000
  for 20%.
We don't want to give up much
  more than 20% of our company.
Joan, I'm gonna give you
  some rolling papers so
  you can smoke this stuff.
[ laughs ]
You should take that offer.
  are you out of your mind?
40% of our company?
Oh, my God.
GREINER: How about this?
We'll go back
  to $100,000 at 30%.
Steve,
  are you okay with that?
I'm okay with that.
Girls,
  do you accept our offer?
We'll do it.
  yes.
Done?
  it's a deal.
Yes, it's done.
  TISCH:
  thank you, ladies.
Yay!
  GREINER: Yay!
Good job, girls.
  ladies.
Thank you!
  thank you!
Thank you so much.
TISCH: Thanks, guys.
[ both laugh ]
Yeah, the rookie
  closes his first deal.
  congratulations, rook.
[ laughs ]
We are so excited and happy
  we got a deal.
We feel like it'll build
  our brand 10 times faster
than we could have done
  on our own.
Yeah.
  100 times faster. Yeah.
  yeah.
NARRATOR:
  Last season, Tania Patruno,
along with company spokesman
  NFL running back Brandon Jacobs,
struck a deal with Daymond John
for their protein-infused water
  PRO-NRG.
I'm gonna give you
  $250,000 for 30%,
contingent on me taking it to a
  protein and supplement company.
That's a yes, Daymond.
  that's a yes.
  all right.
Let's see
  how they're doing now.
Before "Shark Tank,"
  we had $165,000 in sales.
Since airing a year ago,
we have $1.5 million in sales
  and growing.
We now have
  a fulfillment warehouse.
We've completely reformulated
  and repackaged our product,
and we have created
  over 30 new jobs.
After making my deal
  with Daymond,
he introduced us to Kevin
  from rightway nutrition,
who is a big player
  in beverage manufacturing.
And he helped me
  launch my product
into the mainstream market.
We are now on sale
  at every Walgreens nationwide.
Over the next year,
we're projecting
  over $3 million in sales.
Brandon Jacobs has been
  instrumental to our company.
He's constantly pushing
  our product to his friends,
his teammates, his fans --
  anybody who will listen.
Yo, Brandon, what's up?
We're on the field here today
  because we're gonna talk
to Brandon Jacobs about
  our new national campaign.
We need to make people aware
  that it's not only for athletes.
It's for everyday moms
  and kids.
And with the new
  developed flavors
and the way that they're
  improved, kids actually like it.
This thing is bigger
  than we thought.
Man, you've been a great
  partner. Let's keep rocking.
Now why don't you show me some
  football? Show us some moves.
PATRUNO: "Shark Tank" instantly
  put us in the spotlight
and has given us every tool
  to succeed.
I'm so thankful
  for this experience
because it has completely
  changed my life.
NARRATOR: Next up is an
  entrepreneur from Austin, Texas,
with a new way to work out
  while having fun.
