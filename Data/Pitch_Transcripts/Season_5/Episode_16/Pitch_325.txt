JONES: Hello, sharks.
JONES: Look at him.
CUBAN:
  pop. I'm just gonna...
  ah!
[ laughter ]
  Mr. Wonderful,
  you're in trouble.
I got to tell you.
[ laughs ]
  oh!
[ bell dings ]
  look at that.
Great work! Yeah!
  awesome, Mark!
Way to go, Mark!
But you can see
  Mark was 36% accurate.
He was hitting real hard, but
  not necessarily real accurate.
I just wanted
  to knock his ass out.
Great job. I believe
  he knocked him out.
I didn't feel a thing.
Mark, was it fun?
It was a nice little workout.
  how long did we do?
You did 15 seconds.
I mean, doing three minutes on
  that would be a great workout.
O'LEARY: Eventually,
  we got to get to this.
You put a huge valuation
  on this company -- $20 million.
Do you have any sales?
Uh, we do. We are --
sales to date
  are a little over $4 million.
Wow.
$4.2 million.
That's over about 18 months.
Do you make any money?
We are not profitable yet.
We should be profitable
  in September of this year.
Now, Terry, this is really
  a digital punching bag.
A punching bag costs
  about $1,200 --
a good one, leather,
  et cetera.
What does that cost?
Uh, the commercial unit
  is $7,000.
Whoa!
What about the home unit?
  how much is that, Terry?
Uh, $2,995.
JOHN:
  how do you sell them?
We sell --
  we promote it on TV
with direct-to-consumer
  advertising.
We sell it electronically.
So you've been
  running infomercials?
Whoa! Terry, Terry, Terry.
I'm screwed, Terry.
Good luck, Terry.
Thank you very much.
  all the best.
JOHN: I don't know
  if he's gonna get out, Lori.
His mouthpiece
  is in the third row by now.
It's one of those slow-motion
  "aaaaaaah!"
while I appreciate
  what the sharks said,
