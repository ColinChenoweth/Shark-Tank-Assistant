Hello, sharks.
  my name is Bruno Francois.
My product is Cycloramic.
And today I'm seeking $90,000
in exchange
  for 5% of my company.
Cycloramic is a smartphone app
that takes 360-degree
  panoramic photo hands-free.
And you don't even need
  a tripod.
With Cycloramic,
  you're gonna be able
to truly capture
  the whole picture.
I'm gonna show you
  a short demonstration,
show you how amazing
  Cycloramic is.
There you go.

It took all the shots,
and it's gonna stitch
  all the pictures together.
And here it is
  in Cycloramic's 3-D viewer.
So, the base that that's on --
  do you need that base with it?
No, no, it works on the glass
  or granite countertop.
No, no, no, no,
  no, no, no.
  how does it spin?
Not the wood.
  the base that's spinning it.
No, no,
  the base doesn't spin.
It's the phone that spins.
How does the phone spin?
How does it do it?
  can we see it move?
H-how do you get an iPhone
  to spin?
Can we see it move
  without the base?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
  here.
So, you see, it's gonna turn
  and do a 180.
GREINER:
  and it doesn't fall over.
[ camera shutter clicks ]
  no, no, it doesn't.
O'LEARY: Cool.
  [ camera shutter clicks ]
JOHN: Wow!
  I want to buy that.
What is in the app that makes
  the phone move on its own?
So, what we did is when we saw
  that it was moving a little bit,
like, with the vibration,
  we play with the frequency,
which we, like,
  turn it on and off.
And then we tried the rotation
  with the gyro and the compass,
and we see how fast it goes
  and we adjust.
So if it gets stuck,
  we kind of go on and off.
And we're able to do a whole 360
  and then film or take pictures.
So, to be clear,
  the app uses the phone's
own vibration
  to make it spin.
There's no extra accessory,
  nothing else.
There's no extra.
  no extra.
Do you have a patent
  on it?
  yes, I do have a patent.
Utility patent.
  yes.
Very interesting.
TISCH: Okay, so,
  how are you selling this?
On iTunes.
  on the app store.
How much are you charging
  for it?
Right now it's 99 cents.
And how -- how much
  have you sold?
Total downloads --
  around 660,000.
What were your sales with
  that number of downloads?
Income is $175,000.
And what are you projecting
  in sales for this fiscal year?
Well, I'm hoping to do
  $1 million this year.
We got like 300,000 views
  in like a couple of days.
Can I ask you
  about the valuation?
So you want $90,000 for 5%,
  which puts you at $1.8 million.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Why are you valuing it
  at $1.8 million?
Since it's a startup that
  has never got any investment,
it's difficult to put, like,
  a really precise value.
And there's nothing else
that you see out there like it
  on the market today?
No, nobody.
  nobody has done it. Nobody.
So, here's the thing --
I love your ingenuity.
Thank you.
  and I love this.
You know, I can say --
  I can tell instantly
if it's a hero or a zero.
I think
  this is a megawatt hero.
It's a hero.
I'm sorry to interrupt
  the love fest.
  well, I...
Are you gonna make an offer
  or not?
I am going to
  offer you...
$200,000 for 10%.
FRANCOIS: Okay.
I'm an inventor, too.
And I know what it's like to
  be you and stand in your shoes.
I get that excitement
  and that fever,
and I will work with you
  at lightning speed
to get this out there
  everywhere.
I think
  it's a very good offer.
You may want to know, as well,
I do have prototype for a base
  that will rotate, you know.
And I do have
  a provisional patent on that.
So hardware.
  on a base that turns.
FRANCOIS: For any phone.
  for any phone.
So you can put any phone,
  and it rotate.
Bruno, you know, I have
  an offer on the table.
Yeah, I apologize.
Are you interested
  to hear any other offers?
  I know that -- that --
or you just want to listen
  to her squawk?
I really like your offer.
Do you mind if I listen
  to everybody?
You know, just out of respect,
if they want to talk
  and ask more questions?
I don't think
  I want to sit here
waiting for them to figure out
  what they want to do.
So I'd like you
  to tell me right now
if you're going to take my offer
  or not.
CUBAN: That would
  be a mistake.
  JOHN: She's very rude.
That would be
  a mistake.
  she's very rude.
You wouldn't want to do it
  with somebody like that.
They think it may be a mistake,
  but I'm sitting here saying...
Maybe she's not
  the right partner at all.
That's the real issue
  for you.
...You've got a bird
  in the hand.
Maybe you should take it.
I respect Lori's hustle,
  right?
But there's obvious outlets
  for this that may not be obvious
to someone who
  doesn't understand
  the technology, right?
These are apps that I have to
  deal with every day.
I'm an investor in a company
  called condition one.
They do panoramic video.
I have a company called
  motionloft that is being used
by the commercial
  real-estate companies
that tracks people
  as they walk by
so they can count
  in real time.
Mark, it sounds like
  you're selling him on you.
Exactly.
  so are you going to
  make him an offer?
Well, I want to hear more.
I want to hear more about
  what the road map is.
The application is great.
  it's interesting.
But your upside, really, is
  to sell it to Instagram or vine
'cause they have
  the user base,
and this is a huge add-on
  for them.
But the exciting thing
  is since you've been able
to capture the use
  of the vibrations,
where else can you take it
  in terms of applications?
Because that's where
  the world opens up for you
in terms
  of product development.
Well, there's one big
  application -- is games.
I've got a company
  called mention mobile.
  that's all they do.
JOHN:
  I think I've heard enough.
I will offer you $250,000
  for 10%.
Okay.
So now you have to
  ask yourself,
"how much equity
  do I have to give up?"
the challenge
  with the app market --
I've invested in lots of apps
  and tech companies --
is you're an app
  right now.
You're not
  a company yet.
And so you've got to run
  this app as far as you can,
extract as much cash
  as you can --
CUBAN: That's absolutely
  not true.
You're getting 77 cents from it
  right now.
That's absolutely not true,
  and he knows it.
That's absolutely true
  because the only --
it shows how little
  he understands the technology.
Let me finish talking,
  Mark.
I appreciate your input, but
  it's not useful to me right now.
You're welcome.
  so I don't want to hear it.
So at the end of the day,
if you can build
  a portfolio of technologies,
then you might be able
  to sell your company
a couple of years
  from now.
So why give up any equity
  until you've had a chance
to build this out
  a little bit?
Oh, my God. Here comes
  the licensing-royalty joke.
Exactly is what you need.
  [ laughs ]
you don't want to be
  the punch line.
Here's the deal.
  I'll give you your 90k.
FRANCOIS: Mm-hmm.
I'll take a 15% royalty
only on the revenues
  of this application.
Okay.
I'm the only shark up here
that actually made a living
  as a photographer.
Okay.
  and I think that this --
When was that?
  How did that
  work out for you?
It went very well,
  thank you.
So I was a professional
  photographer and cinematographer
and an editor for years.
  FRANCOIS: Okay.
That's why you and I have
  a commonality here.
You have three offers
  on the table.
Hold on. Lori, do you want me
  as your partner in this?
Will you let me
  come in with you?
He may sweeten the pot.
O'LEARY: Interesting.
I'm gonna offer Bruno
  $250,000 for 10%.
Now...
  half mine, half yours.
JOHN:
  you're equaling my offer?
I'm equaling your offer, but
  Lori and I will be partners.
If that's a value
  to Bruno,
I think it's a better offer,
  okay?
He's got a lot
  of connections.
  FRANCOIS: Yes.
O'LEARY:
  You basically have two offers
for $250,000
  for 10% of the equity.
If you don't want
  to give up any equity,
I'm happy to partner with you
and do all of the things
  you want to do.
I have a question
  about licensing.
Do you think
  there would be any way
to license the technology
  to the manufacturer?
If you want to license
  this technology
the hardware guys
  bundled with this app,
that's not a problem,
  either.
I'm the king of licensing.
GREINER: Let's stop.
TISCH: Bruno, do you want
  two real partners?
Close your eyes,
  stop for a minute,
and think to yourself,
"what do I really want?
  what feels right?"
breathe.
Are you done playing games
  with these guys, Bruno?
I'm gonna offer you
  $1 million...
Oh.
...For 30%.
That's more than
  a $3-million valuation.
It's a sweet deal!
NARRATOR: Bruno has four offers
  on the table --
$250,000 for 10%
  from Lori and Steve...
$90,000 for a 15% royalty
  and zero equity from Kevin...
$250,000 for 10% from Daymond...
And $1 million for 30%
  from Mark.
The only deal that really
  makes sense is mine...
  of course.
...Where you don't give up
  any of your equity.
I'll go -- I'll go
  to $300,000 for 10%.
Um...
GREINER: And what partner
  do you really want?
TISCH: Yeah, what partner
  or partners?
I bring sports business,
  entertainment business.
I think your product has
  applications in both industries.
Lori, obviously --
  CUBAN: Ask them to explain
  how the product works.
See if they understand it.
As he's making decisions
  in what direction to go
  with the product,
if you don't understand
  how software's written,
how are you gonna offer
  any guidance, right?
O'LEARY: I'm gonna make it
  more interesting for you.
I'll give you $200,000 for 10%,
but when you pay me back,
  I lose 5% of my equity.
So you get back
  to what you wanted.
You earn it back because
  we're gonna run like hell
to sell as many of these
  as we can.
TISCH: Bruno, Lori and I will
  make the same offer as Kevin.
And $50,000 more.
$250,000, 10%.
  pay us back, it's down to 5%.
I will offer you $350,000
  for 12%.
Okay.
Do you understand
  all the offers now?
  yeah, yeah.
I do have a question
  for Mark.
How would you feel
  working with Lori, as well?
Okay.
  I'm not opposed to it.
So, how much of that
  would you want?
50/50.
You're okay with putting up
  $500,000?
So you just threw Steve
  under a bus.
  okay.
Yeah. Lori just
  kicked me to the curb.
Welcome to the Shark Tank,
  rook!
JOHN: She just ignores her
  other partner like that.
Oh, don't listen to them.
  do you see that?
TISCH: Absolutely.
  horrible.
Don't listen to them.
Kevin...
Why don't you and Daymond
  invite me into your deal?
Interesting.
  GREINER: Mark, we need
  to close our deal now.
They're shuffling deck chairs
  on the Titanic.
This is not deck chairs
  on the Titanic.
There is not an iceberg
  in sight.
Bruno, do not give up
  your equity.
I want to be able to decrease
  a little bit of the equity
for future investment.
  yeah.
But, you know,
  I don't want you to lower
the percent for nothing,
  so I'm giving something back.
CUBAN: How much money would you
  want out of that $1 million?
I wouldn't want to give away
  that much equity,
so probably $500,000
  would be...
Okay.
  so $500,000 for 16.5%.
So each of us would have
  8.25% for 250k.
It's a good deal.
  let's do it.
Come on. Close it.
  I think a better deal
  is I like my --
do you want to hear
  another offer...
  wait.
...Where you give up
  less equity?
Stop. Stop.
  because...
We were
  just about to close.
No, you weren't.
  JOHN: No, you weren't.
Sit down, Lori.
But can you
  just come down?
I mean, I'm really close
  to making a deal,
but 15% seems like...
  TISCH: Bruno,
  we've got a...
So at 15% -- Lori...
Yeah?
  ...It's not worth
  nickel and diming.
So 15%, $500,000?
  yes.
And you know
  we're the right partners.
Yes or no. Got to go.
You gave up 5%
  for nothing.
  Kevin.
Bruno, you got to
  make up your mind.
You've got a deal.
Deal. Yeah.
  yay!
Awesome. [ laughs ]
  it's gonna be great.
Congratulations.
  all right, thank you.
Looking forward to it.
  all right.
Congratulations, though.
  TISCH: Bruno,
  congratulations.
Thank you very much.
  GREINER: Thank you.
Thanks, Bruno.
  all right.
FRANCOIS: 15% is a little more
  than what I came for,
but I got a higher valuation,
and you know, Lori, for
  inventions for me, is important.
And then Mark Cuban, you know,
for all the startups
  he's involved
and all the connections,
  it's a great value.
I think --
  I wanted to get two sharks.
I didn't want just one.
That was awesome, Mark.
No, it wasn't.
  yes, it was.
You're just
  a sore loser.
All I'm saying is our deal
would have been much better
  for him.
He'll probably sleep on it
  and start crying.
[ laughs ] Oh, God.
