JONES: Hello, sharks.
My name is Terry Jones,
  and I'm the C.E.O. Of Nexersys.
We're seeking
  a $2-million investment
for a 10% stake in our company.
Nexersys, the next-generation
  exercise system,
is an interactive
  and intelligent
fitness and gaming platform
that delivers a fast, fun, and
  effective workout for everyone.
It doesn't matter
  if you're an average Joe
or if you're
  an Olympic medalist,
like my friend marlen esparza.
Nexersys combines the benefits
  of a personal trainer
with the fun and excitement
  of today's online games.
You simply select
  your personal profile,
then you choose
  between circuit training,
high-intensity interval rounds,
or a one-on-one challenge
against one
  of our Nexersys avatars.
And you're ready to go.
[ bell dings ]
She would kick my ass.
There you go.
  and when you're complete,
Nexersys provides
  a detailed analysis of your work
every time you train.
You're gonna live a happier,
  sexier, healthier life
using the same methods
  as professional boxers
and MMA athletes
  around the globe.
So, which of you sharks
  would like to draw first blood
against your ultimate opponent?
We've got a, uh, special avatar
  that we brought.
Hey!
  GREINER: [ laughs ]
now, that's
  a good-looking dude.
Go for it, Mark.
Be really easy on him.
  he's a wonderful guy.
One-punch Cuban.
Where it lights up,
  you hit.
JONES: Look at him.
CUBAN:
  pop. I'm just gonna...
  ah!
[ laughter ]
  Mr. Wonderful,
  you're in trouble.
I got to tell you.
[ laughs ]
  oh!
[ bell dings ]
  look at that.
Great work! Yeah!
  awesome, Mark!
Way to go, Mark!
But you can see
  Mark was 36% accurate.
He was hitting real hard, but
  not necessarily real accurate.
I just wanted
  to knock his ass out.
Great job. I believe
  he knocked him out.
I didn't feel a thing.
Mark, was it fun?
It was a nice little workout.
  how long did we do?
You did 15 seconds.
I mean, doing three minutes on
  that would be a great workout.
O'LEARY: Eventually,
  we got to get to this.
You put a huge valuation
  on this company -- $20 million.
Do you have any sales?
Uh, we do. We are --
sales to date
  are a little over $4 million.
Wow.
$4.2 million.
That's over about 18 months.
Do you make any money?
We are not profitable yet.
We should be profitable
  in September of this year.
And is this designed
  for gyms and the home?
Absolutely. The black model
  is the personal model.
The silver model
  is the commercial model.
Where are the sales?
  give me the breakdown.
Currently, about 70% commercial
  and about 30% home.
I think it's very cool.
  I do really like it.
Well, you get demonstration,
  I think, better
than almost anyone in the world
  having your experience on QVC.
While you're groveling
  up to Lori, let's go
  back to the numbers.
What's your cost to make
  one of those units?
Uh, just under $2,000
  for the commercial unit.
Now, Terry, this is really
  a digital punching bag.
A punching bag costs
  about $1,200 --
a good one, leather,
  et cetera.
What does that cost?
Uh, the commercial unit
  is $7,000.
Whoa!
And it is --
  no, that's cheaper...
So I can buy a car
  or buy this.
[ laughs ]
Or you can buy a --
  buy a treadmill
or an elliptical
  in the same price range.
What about the home unit?
  how much is that, Terry?
Uh, $2,995.
JOHN:
  how do you sell them?
We sell --
  we promote it on TV
with direct-to-consumer
  advertising.
We sell it electronically.
So you've been
  running infomercials?
We've run
  one- and two-minute spots.
Not the long form, but, yes.
  all right.
And how are those doing?
They did very well.
  we ran them last year.
We spent about $1 million
  in TV last year.
It generated about $1.5 million
  in sales.
That brings up
  something else.
How much in debt
  are you?
Uh, we have
  on our balance sheet
about $7.5 million
  of shareholder debt.
Whoa!
I knew I was gonna
  get to this after that one.
Whoa! Terry, Terry, Terry.
And how much of that
  is your own money?
Uh... [ stammers ]
a small portion of that
  is mine and my family's money.
And that means that now
  we're gonna find out
you own very little
  of this company, correct?
Um, I own about 35%
  of the company.
You know, I'm a nice guy,
  so I wouldn't do this to you.
But if I were
  an opportunistic guy,
I would just simply wait
  for that debt to come due,
and then I'd own
  your company.
Basically, that's what
  those debtors are gonna do.
If you don't figure out
  a way to pay them,
they'll own all the equity
  when this is over.
Uh, we don't believe
  that's gonna happen
given where we are
  in run rate.
By the time that debt is due,
our cash flow will allow us
  to repay that debt.
But, you know, in life and
  in business, poo-poo happens.
Don't you think
  a savvy financial investor,
of which I'm gonna
  include myself right now,
would want to see
  that resolved
before I put a dime
  into this company?
Because if I buy your equity at
  this valuation of $20 million
and the debt guys
  aren't happy,
I'm screwed, Terry.
We will be repaying that
  and addressing that.
What happens
  if you don't?
Well, we'll have to deal with
  those creditors at that time.
TISCH: How many investors
  do you have?
We have
  about 60 investors.
60.
  oh.
Have your investors
  seen any money back yet?
Oh, hell, no.
No.
This is a story
  about a lot of debt.
Great product.
  too much debt.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I have gone to the future
  in a split second,
and here's
  what happened --
the debt wasn't paid back,
and those shareholders
  wiped you out.
You are now an employee of the
  company with no equity at all.
The smartest guys on the balance
  sheet are always the debt guys.
They know your future
  already.
Luckily, those guys
  are also my common-stock
and convertible-to-venture
  partners.
Yeah, but they're gonna own
  a lot more than common.
No, that doesn't matter.
  that doesn't mater.
They're gonna force you
  into bankruptcy,
and anything that you own
  is going to be gone.
Any assets that you had
  are going to be sold.
And they're gonna take
  their pennies on the dollar.
They're not your friend.
Good luck to you,
  but I have a feeling
when we meet you again,
  you're gonna be an employee.
That's it.
I'm out.
You know, I'd love to, uh, be
  before you today with less debt.
Unfortunately,
  the markets told us
how we could raise money
  to deliver.
We're standing before you
with two products
  with a $20-million valuation,
which is a fraction of companies
like total gym,
  like nordictrack, like bowflex.
These are billion-dollar
  market-cap companies that --
and you're not anything
  like them at all.
Those are
  very simple devices.
How you even spent $7.5 million
  to develop this is beyond me.
And the valuation --
  normally I'm the one
who doesn't care
  about valuation
'cause you can always
  grow past it.
Now you've learned
  from the wise one.
I wouldn't call you the wise
  one. But it's just crazy.
For that reason, I'm out.
You know, you're, like,
  in the third round
with a young Mike Tyson.
He's given you two body blows,
  but he's about to cock back
and crack your head
  to the white meat.
[ laughter ]
That debt is dangerous.
  I'm out.
And then there was one.
I like it. I think it looks
  like a lot of fun.
Great way
  to have a workout.
I think that
  it's a great product.
You are in serious debt, but
  I think you'll get out of it.
But I don't like to get
  into that type of situation.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
  thank you, sharks.
Good luck, Terry.
Thank you very much.
  all the best.
JOHN: I don't know
  if he's gonna get out, Lori.
His mouthpiece
  is in the third row by now.
It's one of those slow-motion
  "aaaaaaah!"
while I appreciate
  what the sharks said,
I have no doubt that Nexersys
  and our team will be successful.
We will overcome these
  little balance-sheet issues
and continue to grow
to a profitable
  and worldwide company.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is an entrepreneur
with a product to help capture
  the world in a whole new way.
