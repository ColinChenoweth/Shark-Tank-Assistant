Hi.
  my name is Chris Pouy.
And I am
  Tiffany Panhilason.
And our company is called
  Cow Wow cereal milk.
And we're asking
  for $250,000
in return for 10%
  of that company.
You know after you have
  your favorite bowl of cereal
and you drink the leftover milk
  and it tastes like...
Heaven?
  heaven?
That's cereal milk,
and we've bottled it
  and made it good for you.
So, how do we get kids
  to try Cow Wow?
We tell them a story.
Once upon a time,
there was a dairy farm
  that ran out of hay.
So the farmers ran
  straight to the cupboards
and fed their cows the only
  thing they had left -- cereal.
The next morning,
  when they milked their cows,
the milk tasted sweet,
just like the cereals
  they love to eat.
The end.
  the end.
Without any further ado,
Tiffany's gonna
  hand out some samples,
and I'm gonna get out
  of this ridiculous cow costume.
Thank you, Tiffany.
Thank you.
  thank you.
All right, so, what Tiffany
  is handing out to you guys
are fruity Trudy
  and chocolate chip Cathy.
And that sugar label's
  actually wrong.
We made a mistake in production.
  it's only 20 grams of sugar.
14 grams of sugar are actually
  in a serving of milk.
A lot of people
  don't know that.
You're basically
  selling milk to kids that tastes
like the leftover milk
  in the bottom of a cereal bowl.
Yes, sir.
What made you think
  of this?
Like, are you
  major cereal lovers?
Milk lovers? Like...?
Yes and yes and yes.
We were, like, in one of those
  yogurt places one night.
And there were so many
  flavors. There was like
  20 flavors of yogurt.
And then we were
  in the convenience store,
and I look,
  and I'm just like, "wow.
"why does milk
  only have three flavors --
chocolate, vanilla,
  and strawberry?" like...
The milk in the bottom
  of the bowl --
is that something
  people like?
I actually --
  I'm a cereal-for-dinner guy.
I love the taste of cereal milk
  in the bottom of the bowl.
Yeah, there's no question,
  right?
Everybody loves -- like you
  said, everybody loves it.
Yeah, I mean, it's the
  best part of the bowl.
  it's the best part
  of the bowl.
I always looked at it like it
  had backwash and drool in it.
Why would I want it?
Have you tested this
  with kids?
What kind of feedback
  have you gotten with kids?
Absolutely.
  they love it.
There's not a kid that has said
  that they didn't.
Let me ask you something.
  I'm dairy-intolerant.
So I didn't try it.
  but, Steve, you --
how -- how did it taste?
  you didn't like it.
Yeah, I mean, look, I'm gonna
  give you a "b" on the taste.
It's not got enough
  cereal taste.
It's not quite
  sweet enough.
It doesn't remind me
  of my favorite cereals.
Okay.
  what are your sales?
It's $20,000.
  we just launched with one sku.
Have you had any reorders
  on it?
Yes, we've had reorders
in all of our grocery stores
  that we were in.
And how many are they?
Right now
  it's eight Bristol farms,
three test stores
  for albertsons,
and we actually
  are one step away
from getting
  a confirmed deal
from one of the largest grocers
  in the country.
And how big
  would that deal be?
About $100,000.
Which category are you trying
  to garner share in?
Because this is not
  a refrigerated product.
Flavored milk --
  $1.5-billion industry.
It doesn't need
  to be refrigerated,
but it tastes better
  when it's cold.
Is it refrigerated
  or not?
It is in albertsons
  and Bristol farms,
but it doesn't
  need to be.
  that is a whole
  different story.
Getting shelf space
  in refrigerated area
is extremely expensive
no matter
  how your cow suit looks.
CUBAN: Now all of a sudden,
  you're competing with Borden,
who has flavored milk and
  can easily come out with more.
So you're competing with them
  and all their marketing dollars.
And I think that's an uphill
  battle that is insurmountable.
$250,000 isn't even gonna
  get you into the game
to compete
  against those guys
'cause you don't have
  a pure differentiation.
So for that reason,
  I'm out.
But, guys, you know,
  this one packet right here
has 24 grams of sugar.
20. That's wrong.
  it has 170 --
20 or 24.
  170 calories
  is a lot...
It's 170 calories.
...For this
  little carton.
  it's a lot, yeah.
To be selling this
  to kids.
  and a lot
  of sugar isn't...
I mean, there's an obesity issue
  we already have.
That's a lot of calories
  for a kid.
We have less sugar
  than any other flavored
  milk on the market.
It's less sugar than any juice
  or any soda.
When they made a petition
  to take flavored milk
  out of schools,
there was an incredible backlash
  from the kids.
You know,
  there was one kid in Ohio
that wrote like
  a five-paragraph essay
about how they wanted
  to get milk back in the school.
Do you realize how bad
  you just screwed up?
What did I say?
  look, you just
  came in here.
We probably
  never would have known
that they tried to take
  flavored milk out of any school.
And you just told us
  one of the biggest red flags
that we probably
  could have uncovered.
Well, the reason
  I want to tell you is because
when they took flavored milk
  out of schools,
the kids started drinking
  soda and juice.
And they demanded,
"please, give us back
  our -- our chocolate milk,"
because they loved it,
  it's more nutritious.
It has nine essential vitamins
  and nutrients.
The ratio of carbs to protein --
  flavored milk is being marketed
as the perfect recovery drink
  for athletes.
Say that again.
What?!
Chocolate milk -- "got milk?"
  did a $25-million campaign
marketing chocolate milk
  to athletes
because the ratio of carbs
  to protein
is actually better
  than most --
not in my locker room.
  is it in your locker room?
[ laughs ] No.
  but this product is not
  positioned to athletes.
This is for children.
  POUY: Well, I'm just saying
  pediatricians and health --
so people are gonna start
  dumping yoo-hoo on people
after they win
  the championship?
[ laughter ]
I think it's dangerous
  to give kids this product.
I-i don't see any value in it
  for me. I'm out.
POUY: We're not trying
  to get kids
to drink something
  that's unhealthy.
There's no ceragenin.
  there's no artificial flavors.
There's no
  artificial sweeteners.
We have the cleanest label
  in flavored milk.
You guys,
  I don't even like milk.
So, I have to love
  and feel passionate
about any deal that I do.
So I'm out.
Chris,
  I love the concept.
I love cereal milk.
  I love the branding.
As I said earlier, it's not
  quite there in terms of taste.
It's a "b."
  I need it to be an "a."
I don't think your product
  is there yet.
I'm out.
In the end,
  what happens?
All cows come back
  to the pasture right here.
Right.
  all right?
So you're saying you want
  your udder pulled?
No, no, I'm basically saying --
  I'm basically saying
it's a very old
  and established space --
a $1.5-billion
  flavored-milk market.
I would think to get a valuation
  here of $2.5 million,
you would need a much more
  concise business plan
that can explain
  to any one of us
why you have a hope in hell
  of getting share.
'cause I think right now
we're going to get crushed
  like an udder.
I'm very out.
Thank you, guys.
  appreciate it.
  thank you.
GREINER: Good luck.
PANHILASON: I think the sharks
  gave great advice.
I mean, they are successful
  for a reason.
POUY: But I think maybe
  they're just a little too old
and they just don't get it.
It doesn't mean that
  we're gonna stop from here.
  yeah.
We're just gonna take
  their advice and make our...
Keep on moo-ving.
Yes. [ chuckles ]
  make our brand better.
[ bicycle bell rings,
  child laughs ]
