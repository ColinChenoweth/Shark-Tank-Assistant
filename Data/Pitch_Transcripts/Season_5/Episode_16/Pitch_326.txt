and prolific film producer
  Steve Tisch joins the tank,
where things
  get even more heated...
Let me finish
  talking, Mark.
  shut up, Kevin.
...In one of the season's
  biggest bidding wars.
You have three offers
  on the table.
Hold on.
  I'm gonna offer $250,000.
I will offer you $350,000.
Are you done playing games
  with these guys?
Do not give up
  your equity.
I'm gonna offer you
  $1 million.
  whoa!
NARRATOR: In the tank,
  hopeful entrepreneurs
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
  to pitch the sharks
in hopes
  of getting an investment
to start, grow,
  or save their businesses.
The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
  they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
  with nothing.
It's a hobby that should be
  taken behind the barn and shot.
Do you realize how bad
  you just screwed up?
  what did I say?
NARRATOR: If the sharks hear
  a great idea...
Sales to date
  are $4.2 million.
  oh.
This is a megawatt hero.
NARRATOR: ...They're ready to
  invest using their own money.
It's a sweet deal.
And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
You know
  we're the right partners.
So you just threw Steve
  under a bus.
Yeah. Lori just
  kicked me to the curb.
Yes!
  maybe she's not
  the right partner at all.
Stop.
  we were just about to close.
No, you weren't.
  JOHN: No, you weren't.
Sit down, Lori.
NARRATOR:
  who are the sharks?
They're millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin o'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.
Mark Cuban -- notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,
tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
  of the NBA's Dallas mavericks.
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
  holds over 100 patents
and has launched
  over 300 products
grossing over $500 million
  in retail sales.
Daymond John is a fashion
  and branding expert
who grew
  his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand fubu,
with over $6 billion
  in retail sales to date.
And Steve Tisch.
He is a renowned film producer,
  businessman,
and co-owner
  of the New York Giants.
He is also the only person with
  an Oscar and a Super Bowl ring.
First into the tank
  is a couple with a product
hoping to emulate the best part
  of a favorite breakfast food.
[ laughs ]
Hi.
  my name is Chris Pouy.
And I am
  Tiffany Panhilason.
And our company is called
  Cow Wow cereal milk.
And we're asking
  for $250,000
in return for 10%
  of that company.
You know after you have
  your favorite bowl of cereal
and you drink the leftover milk
  and it tastes like...
Heaven?
  heaven?
That's cereal milk,
and we've bottled it
  and made it good for you.
So, how do we get kids
  to try Cow Wow?
We tell them a story.
Once upon a time,
there was a dairy farm
  that ran out of hay.
So the farmers ran
  straight to the cupboards
and fed their cows the only
  thing they had left -- cereal.
The next morning,
  when they milked their cows,
the milk tasted sweet,
just like the cereals
  they love to eat.
The end.
  the end.
Without any further ado,
Tiffany's gonna
  hand out some samples,
and I'm gonna get out
  of this ridiculous cow costume.
Thank you, Tiffany.
Thank you.
  thank you.
All right, so, what Tiffany
  is handing out to you guys
are fruity Trudy
  and chocolate chip Cathy.
And that sugar label's
  actually wrong.
We made a mistake in production.
  it's only 20 grams of sugar.
14 grams of sugar are actually
  in a serving of milk.
A lot of people
  don't know that.
You're basically
  selling milk to kids that tastes
like the leftover milk
  in the bottom of a cereal bowl.
Yes, sir.
What made you think
  of this?
Like, are you
  major cereal lovers?
Milk lovers? Like...?
Yes and yes and yes.
We were, like, in one of those
  yogurt places one night.
And there were so many
  flavors. There was like
  20 flavors of yogurt.
And then we were
  in the convenience store,
and I look,
  and I'm just like, "wow.
"why does milk
  only have three flavors --
chocolate, vanilla,
  and strawberry?" like...
The milk in the bottom
  of the bowl --
is that something
  people like?
I actually --
  I'm a cereal-for-dinner guy.
I love the taste of cereal milk
  in the bottom of the bowl.
Yeah, there's no question,
  right?
Everybody loves -- like you
  said, everybody loves it.
Yeah, I mean, it's the
  best part of the bowl.
  it's the best part
  of the bowl.
I always looked at it like it
  had backwash and drool in it.
Why would I want it?
Have you tested this
  with kids?
What kind of feedback
  have you gotten with kids?
Absolutely.
  they love it.
There's not a kid that has said
  that they didn't.
Let me ask you something.
  I'm dairy-intolerant.
So I didn't try it.
  but, Steve, you --
how -- how did it taste?
  you didn't like it.
Yeah, I mean, look, I'm gonna
  give you a "b" on the taste.
It's not got enough
  cereal taste.
It's not quite
  sweet enough.
It doesn't remind me
  of my favorite cereals.
Okay.
  what are your sales?
It's $20,000.
  we just launched with one sku.
Have you had any reorders
  on it?
Yes, we've had reorders
in all of our grocery stores
  that we were in.
And how many are they?
Right now
  it's eight Bristol farms,
three test stores
  for albertsons,
and we actually
  are one step away
from getting
  a confirmed deal
from one of the largest grocers
  in the country.
And how big
  would that deal be?
About $100,000.
Which category are you trying
  to garner share in?
Because this is not
  a refrigerated product.
Flavored milk --
  $1.5-billion industry.
It doesn't need
  to be refrigerated,
but it tastes better
  when it's cold.
Is it refrigerated
  or not?
It is in albertsons
  and Bristol farms,
but it doesn't
  need to be.
  that is a whole
  different story.
Getting shelf space
  in refrigerated area
is extremely expensive
no matter
  how your cow suit looks.
CUBAN: Now all of a sudden,
  you're competing with Borden,
who has flavored milk and
  can easily come out with more.
So you're competing with them
  and all their marketing dollars.
And I think that's an uphill
  battle that is insurmountable.
$250,000 isn't even gonna
  get you into the game
to compete
  against those guys
'cause you don't have
  a pure differentiation.
So for that reason,
  I'm out.
But, guys, you know,
  this one packet right here
has 24 grams of sugar.
20. That's wrong.
  it has 170 --
20 or 24.
  170 calories
  is a lot...
It's 170 calories.
...For this
  little carton.
  it's a lot, yeah.
To be selling this
  to kids.
  and a lot
  of sugar isn't...
I mean, there's an obesity issue
  we already have.
That's a lot of calories
  for a kid.
We have less sugar
  than any other flavored
  milk on the market.
It's less sugar than any juice
  or any soda.
When they made a petition
  to take flavored milk
  out of schools,
there was an incredible backlash
  from the kids.
You know,
  there was one kid in Ohio
that wrote like
  a five-paragraph essay
about how they wanted
  to get milk back in the school.
Do you realize how bad
  you just screwed up?
What did I say?
  look, you just
  came in here.
We probably
  never would have known
that they tried to take
  flavored milk out of any school.
And you just told us
  one of the biggest red flags
that we probably
  could have uncovered.
Well, the reason
  I want to tell you is because
when they took flavored milk
  out of schools,
the kids started drinking
  soda and juice.
And they demanded,
"please, give us back
  our -- our chocolate milk,"
because they loved it,
  it's more nutritious.
It has nine essential vitamins
  and nutrients.
The ratio of carbs to protein --
  flavored milk is being marketed
as the perfect recovery drink
  for athletes.
Say that again.
What?!
Chocolate milk -- "got milk?"
  did a $25-million campaign
marketing chocolate milk
  to athletes
because the ratio of carbs
  to protein
is actually better
  than most --
not in my locker room.
  is it in your locker room?
[ laughs ] No.
  but this product is not
  positioned to athletes.
This is for children.
  POUY: Well, I'm just saying
  pediatricians and health --
so people are gonna start
  dumping yoo-hoo on people
after they win
  the championship?
[ laughter ]
I think it's dangerous
  to give kids this product.
I-i don't see any value in it
  for me. I'm out.
POUY: We're not trying
  to get kids
to drink something
  that's unhealthy.
There's no ceragenin.
  there's no artificial flavors.
There's no
  artificial sweeteners.
We have the cleanest label
  in flavored milk.
You guys,
  I don't even like milk.
So, I have to love
  and feel passionate
about any deal that I do.
So I'm out.
Chris,
  I love the concept.
I love cereal milk.
  I love the branding.
As I said earlier, it's not
  quite there in terms of taste.
It's a "b."
  I need it to be an "a."
I don't think your product
  is there yet.
I'm out.
In the end,
  what happens?
All cows come back
  to the pasture right here.
Right.
  all right?
So you're saying you want
  your udder pulled?
No, no, I'm basically saying --
  I'm basically saying
it's a very old
  and established space --
a $1.5-billion
  flavored-milk market.
I would think to get a valuation
  here of $2.5 million,
you would need a much more
  concise business plan
that can explain
  to any one of us
why you have a hope in hell
  of getting share.
'cause I think right now
we're going to get crushed
  like an udder.
I'm very out.
Thank you, guys.
  appreciate it.
  thank you.
GREINER: Good luck.
PANHILASON: I think the sharks
  gave great advice.
I mean, they are successful
  for a reason.
POUY: But I think maybe
  they're just a little too old
and they just don't get it.
It doesn't mean that
  we're gonna stop from here.
  yeah.
We're just gonna take
  their advice and make our...
Keep on moo-ving.
Yes. [ chuckles ]
  make our brand better.
[ bicycle bell rings,
  child laughs ]
I'm Joan.
  and I'm Julia.
BOTH: And we're sisters
  from Normal, Illinois.
Growing up in a family of seven,
  everything was homemade.
Baking is practically
  in our blood.
We've been baking since we've
  been little girls with our mom
in the kitchen
  and haven't stopped.
Let's go eat.
We've developed
  the perfect alternative
to one of America's
  guiltiest pleasures.
It's gourmet,
  it's delicious,
and there's nothing like it
  on the market.
[ both laugh ]
Working together as sisters
  is fun.
I'm the boss.
  no, you're not.
  yeah, I am.
Neither of us are the boss.
  we're partners.
We are partners, but most
  of the time, I am the boss.
Okay. A little room.
Our facility is
  the world's tiniest kitchen.
Getting an investment
  would put us into a place
where we can actually have
  a production.
Americans are gonna love our
  product because it's unique
and it's a sweet treat
  that everyone can enjoy.
We want to be
  in mass production,
and we want to become
  a national brand,
and we need the sharks
  to help us do that.
And I'm Julia Schmid.
  and we're sisters.
And together
  we own...
BOTH:
  ...The Cookie Dough Cafe.
We are seeking $50,000
  for 20% of our company.
Anyone who has ever baked
  homemade cookies
knows how tempting
  the cookie dough can be.
It's gooey. It's sweet.
  it's sinful.
But we all know we should not be
  sneaking bites of cookie dough.
We've heard about raw eggs
  and salmonella,
and every pre-packaged
  cookie dough has labels
saying, "warning --
  do not eat raw."
even though we know this,
  we still swipe by the spoonful.
That's why we created
  a safe, edible cookie dough
that is strictly made for
  eating, indulging, and enjoying.
Yes!
Don't bother
  preheating your oven.
You can enjoy our product
  straight from the jar.
delicious candies, real butter,
  and no added preservatives.
We have the only gourmet, edible
  cookie dough on the market
specifically made
  to consume as is.
We have hand-packed thousands
  of pints of cookie dough
in the world's
  tiniest kitchen.
We need your help.
So grab a spoon
  and dig right in.
Yes!
  hey! [ laughs ]
you get the Oreo,
  Steve.
And Lori gets
  the chocolate chip.
Whoa!
Now, what is stopping salmonella
  from growing in this?
It contains no eggs
  whatsoever.
Hmm.
GREINER:
  oh, this is great.
  thank you.
  thank you.
This tastes so good.
  what does this pint sell for?
$6.99 is what
  it retails for.
And what do you
  make it for?
  $2.20.
Can you also bake cookies
  with this, or no?
BOTH: You can.
But they'll just be
  really flat because
  there's no baking soda.
And they don't taste as good
  baked without the eggs.
And you've been in business
  how long?
A little over a year.
How are the sales?
Our sales to date
  are $24,000.
What were your sales
  last month?
Last month, they were
  probably $1,600.
1,600 units or $1,600?
Dollars.
Yes.
$1,600?
  we were
  in seven stores.
Seven stores.
  we just --
we got a purchase order
  last week
for more than what
  we've sold all year.
It's gonna put us
  in an additional
50 fresh market
  grocery stores.
Your purchase order was for how
  much money and how many units?
2,300 pints. And we'll make
  about $6,000 on it.
GREINER: What's your mode
  of selling?
How are you trying to get
  your product out there?
We don't do any marketing
  or anything like that. Um --
how are you getting into
  the grocery stores, though?
'cause that's very hard.
  we approached
  the fresh market.
Yeah, we went and talked to
  the manager in normal, Illinois.
He looked at our packaging.
  he tasted our product.
And he was like,
  "this is gonna be huge."
and how much has he sold --
  has that one store sold?
$11,000 of our sales
  last year.
Over a year?
  in just one store.
Do you really think,
  in one store,
a product that only does $11,000
  can stay on the shelf?
It's $900 a month.
Who cares?
Now, stop it.
But, I mean,
  think about it.
If you could get
  that year back
and you never had
  this nightmare, would you --
shut up, Kevin.
  Kevin!
Are you kidding?
How much
  have you invested?
$35,000 total.
  total.
What are you gonna do
  with the $50,000?
Purchase equipment that'll help
  automate the packing process
'cause that's the most
  time-consuming part
of our job
  right now.
What are you guys doing now
  to make a living?
Is this all you're doing?
I'm an agent at
  an R.V. Dealership.
  okay.
And I'm
  a stay-at-home mom.
We come from a family
  of entrepreneurs.
Our dad literally swept
  the floor in a factory
and started
  his own business.
Unfortunately,
  he's passed away,
but one of our older brothers
  took over the business,
and it's a multimillion-dollar
  business now.
How come your brother hasn't
  helped you with the $50,000?
We haven't asked.
Why?
  I don't know.
Sense of pride? I mean...
  [ chuckles ] yeah.
I get that.
We're here, obviously,
  for the $50,000,
but we also need
  some connections,
like getting our product
  in a manufacturing facility.
We don't know
  how to do that.
JOHN: That leads me
  to my next statement.
I love it.
If you do this deal,
  I'm gonna add egg to yours.
But it's so early
  at this point.
I would have to do
  way more work.
I would have to ask you
  for so much of the company
that it would be unfair.
I wouldn't have the time
  to help you.
I'm a customer
  but not an investor.
I'm out.
I like what you guys are doing.
  it tastes great.
But to Daymond's point,
you're still in that early,
  early, early stage,
and you're gonna
  be turning to us
because you don't want to
  have to go through this blindly.
That's the whole point
  of coming here, right?
And so that creates
  a lot of work for us.
But don't you think
  that's good, too?
We don't have
  $1 million in sales
and we're not in here
  asking you for $500,000?
Can't you see this
  in stadiums...
  oh, absolutely.
...And theaters and
  single cookie-dough cups?
Yeah, in some respects,
  you're right.
But it's too early.
And so for that reason,
  I'm out.
O'LEARY: My big problem with
  this is the proof of concept.
You've practically
  sold nothing.
I don't think this is
  going to be a big product.
I really don't.
When we just got
  50 additional stores?
You would give up
  when you just went
from 7 stores to 50
  in a week?
I mean, look, I don't want
  to insult you --
Kevin sees the word "dough,"
  and he gets confused.
I don't want you to pursue
  the path to hell on Earth.
It's a hobby that eventually
should be taken behind the barn
  and shot.
I hate it.
I'm out.
NARRATOR:
  three sharks are out.
Julia and Joan have only two
  chances left to make a deal.
We've had people approach us,
  and we can't get
to that next step because
  we weren't with a distributor.
We've had Walgreens
  call us up.
We had everything finalized
  to be in their flagship stores
like you have in Hollywood,
  downtown Chicago.
How did you
  get into Walgreens?
They
  approached us.
They saw
  our product...
  where?
...On the fresh market shelf
  and called us up.
Because we weren't with
  a distributor they used --
you know,
  we're not big enough yet,
they said,
  "call us when you get in."
so that door is still open,
  you think?
Oh, yeah.
  it's still -- I talked
  to her two weeks ago.
You know, I remember what
  it was like to be just like you.
I don't agree with Mark.
  I don't mind doing hard work.
And you don't mind
  doing hard work.
  no, I don't.
So I think
  we'll put our heads together,
do a lot of hard work,
  and get it out there everywhere.
But I also was sitting here
  thinking, when you said,
"it would be good in stadiums."
I've got a guy next to me.
  he's got some stadiums, himself.
I think it's a great product
  for stadiums.
I've also got great contacts
  in hotels.
I think this in a hotel room --
  slam dunk.
Would you want
  to partner with me?
Go 50/50?
Yes, and you get two sharks
  with different contacts,
different connections,
  different opportunities.
We like that.
We like that. Yeah.
  GREINER: It's a lot.
How about we give you $100,000
  for a 30% stake?
I think we should offer $100,000
  for 40%.
Okay.
And we see this also paired
  with a large ice cream --
guys, guys!
  that is a sweet deal.
What are you gonna do?
  did you hear
  what they said?
It's a lot of dough
  for your dough.
I would rather do
  the $50,000.
I would rather do $50,000
  for 20%.
We don't want to give up much
  more than 20% of our company.
We are so excited and happy
  we got a deal.
We feel like it'll build
  our brand 10 times faster
than we could have done
  on our own.
Yeah.
  100 times faster. Yeah.
  yeah.
NARRATOR:
  Last season, Tania Patruno,
along with company spokesman
  NFL running back Brandon Jacobs,
struck a deal with Daymond John
for their protein-infused water
  PRO-NRG.
I'm gonna give you
  $250,000 for 30%,
contingent on me taking it to a
  protein and supplement company.
That's a yes, Daymond.
  that's a yes.
  all right.
Let's see
  how they're doing now.
Before "Shark Tank,"
  we had $165,000 in sales.
Since airing a year ago,
we have $1.5 million in sales
  and growing.
We now have
  a fulfillment warehouse.
We've completely reformulated
  and repackaged our product,
and we have created
  over 30 new jobs.
After making my deal
  with Daymond,
he introduced us to Kevin
  from rightway nutrition,
who is a big player
  in beverage manufacturing.
And he helped me
  launch my product
into the mainstream market.
We are now on sale
  at every Walgreens nationwide.
Over the next year,
we're projecting
  over $3 million in sales.
Brandon Jacobs has been
  instrumental to our company.
He's constantly pushing
  our product to his friends,
his teammates, his fans --
  anybody who will listen.
Yo, Brandon, what's up?
We're on the field here today
  because we're gonna talk
to Brandon Jacobs about
  our new national campaign.
We need to make people aware
  that it's not only for athletes.
It's for everyday moms
  and kids.
And with the new
  developed flavors
and the way that they're
  improved, kids actually like it.
This thing is bigger
  than we thought.
Man, you've been a great
  partner. Let's keep rocking.
Now why don't you show me some
  football? Show us some moves.
PATRUNO: "Shark Tank" instantly
  put us in the spotlight
and has given us every tool
  to succeed.
I'm so thankful
  for this experience
because it has completely
  changed my life.
NARRATOR: Next up is an
  entrepreneur from Austin, Texas,
with a new way to work out
  while having fun.
My name is Terry Jones,
  and I'm the C.E.O. Of Nexersys.
We're seeking
  a $2-million investment
for a 10% stake in our company.
Nexersys, the next-generation
  exercise system,
is an interactive
  and intelligent
fitness and gaming platform
that delivers a fast, fun, and
  effective workout for everyone.
It doesn't matter
  if you're an average Joe
or if you're
  an Olympic medalist,
like my friend marlen esparza.
Nexersys combines the benefits
  of a personal trainer
with the fun and excitement
  of today's online games.
You simply select
  your personal profile,
then you choose
  between circuit training,
high-intensity interval rounds,
or a one-on-one challenge
against one
  of our Nexersys avatars.
And you're ready to go.
[ bell dings ]
She would kick my ass.
There you go.
  and when you're complete,
Nexersys provides
  a detailed analysis of your work
every time you train.
You're gonna live a happier,
  sexier, healthier life
using the same methods
  as professional boxers
and MMA athletes
  around the globe.
So, which of you sharks
  would like to draw first blood
against your ultimate opponent?
We've got a, uh, special avatar
  that we brought.
Hey!
  GREINER: [ laughs ]
now, that's
  a good-looking dude.
Go for it, Mark.
Be really easy on him.
  he's a wonderful guy.
One-punch Cuban.
Where it lights up,
  you hit.
And is this designed
  for gyms and the home?
Absolutely. The black model
  is the personal model.
The silver model
  is the commercial model.
Where are the sales?
  give me the breakdown.
Currently, about 70% commercial
  and about 30% home.
I think it's very cool.
  I do really like it.
Well, you get demonstration,
  I think, better
than almost anyone in the world
  having your experience on QVC.
While you're groveling
  up to Lori, let's go
  back to the numbers.
What's your cost to make
  one of those units?
Uh, just under $2,000
  for the commercial unit.
And it is --
  no, that's cheaper...
So I can buy a car
  or buy this.
[ laughs ]
Or you can buy a --
  buy a treadmill
or an elliptical
  in the same price range.
We've run
  one- and two-minute spots.
Not the long form, but, yes.
  all right.
And how are those doing?
They did very well.
  we ran them last year.
We spent about $1 million
  in TV last year.
It generated about $1.5 million
  in sales.
That brings up
  something else.
How much in debt
  are you?
Uh, we have
  on our balance sheet
about $7.5 million
  of shareholder debt.
Whoa!
I knew I was gonna
  get to this after that one.
And how much of that
  is your own money?
Uh... [ stammers ]
a small portion of that
  is mine and my family's money.
And that means that now
  we're gonna find out
you own very little
  of this company, correct?
Um, I own about 35%
  of the company.
You know, I'm a nice guy,
  so I wouldn't do this to you.
But if I were
  an opportunistic guy,
I would just simply wait
  for that debt to come due,
and then I'd own
  your company.
Basically, that's what
  those debtors are gonna do.
If you don't figure out
  a way to pay them,
they'll own all the equity
  when this is over.
Uh, we don't believe
  that's gonna happen
given where we are
  in run rate.
By the time that debt is due,
our cash flow will allow us
  to repay that debt.
But, you know, in life and
  in business, poo-poo happens.
Don't you think
  a savvy financial investor,
of which I'm gonna
  include myself right now,
would want to see
  that resolved
before I put a dime
  into this company?
Because if I buy your equity at
  this valuation of $20 million
and the debt guys
  aren't happy,
We will be repaying that
  and addressing that.
What happens
  if you don't?
Well, we'll have to deal with
  those creditors at that time.
TISCH: How many investors
  do you have?
We have
  about 60 investors.
60.
  oh.
Have your investors
  seen any money back yet?
Oh, hell, no.
No.
This is a story
  about a lot of debt.
Great product.
  too much debt.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I have gone to the future
  in a split second,
and here's
  what happened --
the debt wasn't paid back,
and those shareholders
  wiped you out.
You are now an employee of the
  company with no equity at all.
The smartest guys on the balance
  sheet are always the debt guys.
They know your future
  already.
Luckily, those guys
  are also my common-stock
and convertible-to-venture
  partners.
Yeah, but they're gonna own
  a lot more than common.
No, that doesn't matter.
  that doesn't mater.
They're gonna force you
  into bankruptcy,
and anything that you own
  is going to be gone.
Any assets that you had
  are going to be sold.
And they're gonna take
  their pennies on the dollar.
They're not your friend.
Good luck to you,
  but I have a feeling
when we meet you again,
  you're gonna be an employee.
That's it.
I'm out.
You know, I'd love to, uh, be
  before you today with less debt.
Unfortunately,
  the markets told us
how we could raise money
  to deliver.
We're standing before you
with two products
  with a $20-million valuation,
which is a fraction of companies
like total gym,
  like nordictrack, like bowflex.
These are billion-dollar
  market-cap companies that --
and you're not anything
  like them at all.
Those are
  very simple devices.
How you even spent $7.5 million
  to develop this is beyond me.
And the valuation --
  normally I'm the one
who doesn't care
  about valuation
'cause you can always
  grow past it.
Now you've learned
  from the wise one.
I wouldn't call you the wise
  one. But it's just crazy.
For that reason, I'm out.
You know, you're, like,
  in the third round
with a young Mike Tyson.
He's given you two body blows,
  but he's about to cock back
and crack your head
  to the white meat.
[ laughter ]
That debt is dangerous.
  I'm out.
And then there was one.
I like it. I think it looks
  like a lot of fun.
Great way
  to have a workout.
I think that
  it's a great product.
You are in serious debt, but
  I think you'll get out of it.
But I don't like to get
  into that type of situation.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thank you, Lori.
  thank you, sharks.
I have no doubt that Nexersys
  and our team will be successful.
We will overcome these
  little balance-sheet issues
and continue to grow
to a profitable
  and worldwide company.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
  is an entrepreneur
with a product to help capture
  the world in a whole new way.
And today I'm seeking $90,000
in exchange
  for 5% of my company.
Cycloramic is a smartphone app
that takes 360-degree
  panoramic photo hands-free.
And you don't even need
  a tripod.
With Cycloramic,
  you're gonna be able
to truly capture
  the whole picture.
I'm gonna show you
  a short demonstration,
show you how amazing
  Cycloramic is.
There you go.
[ camera shutter clicks ]
[ camera shutter clicks ]
[ camera shutter clicks ]
[ camera shutter clicks ]
It took all the shots,
and it's gonna stitch
  all the pictures together.
And here it is
  in Cycloramic's 3-D viewer.
So, the base that that's on --
  do you need that base with it?
No, no, it works on the glass
  or granite countertop.
No, no, no, no,
  no, no, no.
  how does it spin?
Not the wood.
  the base that's spinning it.
No, no,
  the base doesn't spin.
It's the phone that spins.
How does the phone spin?
How does it do it?
  can we see it move?
H-how do you get an iPhone
  to spin?
Can we see it move
  without the base?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
  here.
So, you see, it's gonna turn
  and do a 180.
GREINER:
  and it doesn't fall over.
[ camera shutter clicks ]
  no, no, it doesn't.
O'LEARY: Cool.
  [ camera shutter clicks ]
JOHN: Wow!
  I want to buy that.
What is in the app that makes
  the phone move on its own?
So, what we did is when we saw
  that it was moving a little bit,
like, with the vibration,
  we play with the frequency,
which we, like,
  turn it on and off.
And then we tried the rotation
  with the gyro and the compass,
and we see how fast it goes
  and we adjust.
So if it gets stuck,
  we kind of go on and off.
And we're able to do a whole 360
  and then film or take pictures.
So, to be clear,
  the app uses the phone's
own vibration
  to make it spin.
There's no extra accessory,
  nothing else.
There's no extra.
  no extra.
Do you have a patent
  on it?
  yes, I do have a patent.
Utility patent.
  yes.
Very interesting.
TISCH: Okay, so,
  how are you selling this?
On iTunes.
  on the app store.
How much are you charging
  for it?
Right now it's 99 cents.
And how -- how much
  have you sold?
Total downloads --
  around 660,000.
What were your sales with
  that number of downloads?
Income is $175,000.
And what are you projecting
  in sales for this fiscal year?
Well, I'm hoping to do
  $1 million this year.
We got like 300,000 views
  in like a couple of days.
Can I ask you
  about the valuation?
So you want $90,000 for 5%,
  which puts you at $1.8 million.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Why are you valuing it
  at $1.8 million?
Since it's a startup that
  has never got any investment,
it's difficult to put, like,
  a really precise value.
And there's nothing else
that you see out there like it
  on the market today?
No, nobody.
  nobody has done it. Nobody.
So, here's the thing --
I love your ingenuity.
Thank you.
  and I love this.
You know, I can say --
  I can tell instantly
if it's a hero or a zero.
I think
  this is a megawatt hero.
It's a hero.
I'm sorry to interrupt
  the love fest.
  well, I...
Are you gonna make an offer
  or not?
I am going to
  offer you...
$200,000 for 10%.
And I know what it's like to
  be you and stand in your shoes.
I get that excitement
  and that fever,
and I will work with you
  at lightning speed
to get this out there
  everywhere.
I think
  it's a very good offer.
You may want to know, as well,
I do have prototype for a base
  that will rotate, you know.
And I do have
  a provisional patent on that.
So hardware.
  on a base that turns.
So you can put any phone,
  and it rotate.
if they want to talk
  and ask more questions?
I don't think
  I want to sit here
waiting for them to figure out
  what they want to do.
So I'd like you
  to tell me right now
if you're going to take my offer
  or not.
CUBAN: That would
  be a mistake.
  JOHN: She's very rude.
That would be
  a mistake.
  she's very rude.
You wouldn't want to do it
  with somebody like that.
They think it may be a mistake,
  but I'm sitting here saying...
Maybe she's not
  the right partner at all.
That's the real issue
  for you.
...You've got a bird
  in the hand.
Maybe you should take it.
I respect Lori's hustle,
  right?
But there's obvious outlets
  for this that may not be obvious
to someone who
  doesn't understand
  the technology, right?
These are apps that I have to
  deal with every day.
I'm an investor in a company
  called condition one.
They do panoramic video.
I have a company called
  motionloft that is being used
by the commercial
  real-estate companies
that tracks people
  as they walk by
so they can count
  in real time.
Mark, it sounds like
  you're selling him on you.
Exactly.
  so are you going to
  make him an offer?
Well, I want to hear more.
I want to hear more about
  what the road map is.
The application is great.
  it's interesting.
But your upside, really, is
  to sell it to Instagram or vine
'cause they have
  the user base,
and this is a huge add-on
  for them.
But the exciting thing
  is since you've been able
to capture the use
  of the vibrations,
where else can you take it
  in terms of applications?
Because that's where
  the world opens up for you
in terms
  of product development.
Well, there's one big
  application -- is games.
I've got a company
  called mention mobile.
  that's all they do.
JOHN:
  I think I've heard enough.
I will offer you $250,000
  for 10%.
Okay.
So now you have to
  ask yourself,
"how much equity
  do I have to give up?"
the challenge
  with the app market --
I've invested in lots of apps
  and tech companies --
is you're an app
  right now.
You're not
  a company yet.
And so you've got to run
  this app as far as you can,
extract as much cash
  as you can --
CUBAN: That's absolutely
  not true.
You're getting 77 cents from it
  right now.
That's absolutely not true,
  and he knows it.
That's absolutely true
  because the only --
it shows how little
  he understands the technology.
Let me finish talking,
  Mark.
I appreciate your input, but
  it's not useful to me right now.
You're welcome.
  so I don't want to hear it.
So at the end of the day,
if you can build
  a portfolio of technologies,
then you might be able
  to sell your company
a couple of years
  from now.
So why give up any equity
  until you've had a chance
to build this out
  a little bit?
Oh, my God. Here comes
  the licensing-royalty joke.
Exactly is what you need.
  [ laughs ]
you don't want to be
  the punch line.
Here's the deal.
  I'll give you your 90k.
Okay.
  and I think that this --
When was that?
  How did that
  work out for you?
It went very well,
  thank you.
So I was a professional
  photographer and cinematographer
and an editor for years.
  FRANCOIS: Okay.
That's why you and I have
  a commonality here.
You have three offers
  on the table.
Hold on. Lori, do you want me
  as your partner in this?
Will you let me
  come in with you?
He may sweeten the pot.
O'LEARY: Interesting.
I'm equaling your offer, but
  Lori and I will be partners.
and do all of the things
  you want to do.
I have a question
  about licensing.
Do you think
  there would be any way
to license the technology
  to the manufacturer?
If you want to license
  this technology
the hardware guys
  bundled with this app,
that's not a problem,
  either.
I'm the king of licensing.
GREINER: Let's stop.
and think to yourself,
"what do I really want?
  what feels right?"
breathe.
$250,000 for 10%
  from Lori and Steve...
$90,000 for a 15% royalty
  and zero equity from Kevin...
$250,000 for 10% from Daymond...
And $1 million for 30%
  from Mark.
The only deal that really
  makes sense is mine...
  of course.
...Where you don't give up
  any of your equity.
I'll go -- I'll go
  to $300,000 for 10%.
Um...
GREINER: And what partner
  do you really want?
TISCH: Yeah, what partner
  or partners?
I bring sports business,
  entertainment business.
I think your product has
  applications in both industries.
Lori, obviously --
  CUBAN: Ask them to explain
  how the product works.
See if they understand it.
As he's making decisions
  in what direction to go
  with the product,
if you don't understand
  how software's written,
how are you gonna offer
  any guidance, right?
O'LEARY: I'm gonna make it
  more interesting for you.
I'll give you $200,000 for 10%,
but when you pay me back,
  I lose 5% of my equity.
So you get back
  to what you wanted.
You earn it back because
  we're gonna run like hell
to sell as many of these
  as we can.
TISCH: Bruno, Lori and I will
  make the same offer as Kevin.
And $50,000 more.
$250,000, 10%.
  pay us back, it's down to 5%.
I will offer you $350,000
  for 12%.
Okay.
Do you understand
  all the offers now?
  yeah, yeah.
I do have a question
  for Mark.
How would you feel
  working with Lori, as well?
Okay.
  I'm not opposed to it.
So, how much of that
  would you want?
50/50.
You're okay with putting up
  $500,000?
So you just threw Steve
  under a bus.
  okay.
Yeah. Lori just
  kicked me to the curb.
Welcome to the Shark Tank,
  rook!
JOHN: She just ignores her
  other partner like that.
Oh, don't listen to them.
  do you see that?
TISCH: Absolutely.
  horrible.
Don't listen to them.
Kevin...
Why don't you and Daymond
  invite me into your deal?
Interesting.
  GREINER: Mark, we need
  to close our deal now.
They're shuffling deck chairs
  on the Titanic.
This is not deck chairs
  on the Titanic.
There is not an iceberg
  in sight.
Yeah?
  ...It's not worth
  nickel and diming.
So 15%, $500,000?
  yes.
And you know
  we're the right partners.
Yes or no. Got to go.
You gave up 5%
  for nothing.
  Kevin.
and you know, Lori, for
  inventions for me, is important.
And then Mark Cuban, you know,
for all the startups
  he's involved
and all the connections,
  it's a great value.
I think --
  I wanted to get two sharks.
I didn't want just one.
That was awesome, Mark.
No, it wasn't.
  yes, it was.
You're just
  a sore loser.
All I'm saying is our deal
would have been much better
  for him.
He'll probably sleep on it
  and start crying.
[ laughs ] Oh, God.
