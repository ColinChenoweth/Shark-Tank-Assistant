Hi, sharks.
My name is Jason Hanson.
My company
is Spy Escape &amp; Evasion,
and I am seeking $100,000
in exchange
for 15% of my company.
The world of espionage
is a dangerous one.
To survive, you need to be able
to adapt to any situation.
You need to blend in
with your surroundings.
And only when necessary do you
reveal your true identity.
Actually, sharks, my name
is Hanson -- Jason Hanson.
Thank you for your help.
As a former C.I.A. officer,
I can also tell you
that you need to be able
to detect a threat.
You need to be able to adapt
to any situation, as mentioned.
You also need to be able
to escape capture.
Let's do a little training
exercise, and I'll show you.
Barbara,
do you mind assisting me?
I'm gonna have you come
and duct-tape my hands.
I love
this kind of stuff.
[laughter]
Don't tell Kevin!
What I'm gonna have you do
is just go around my wrists
three or four times --
whatever you prefer.
Happily.
Don't worry about the hair.
It'll grow back.
That's perfect.
[chuckles]
Thank you very much,
Barbara.
That's it?
I appreciate it.
That's -- well, there'll be
more later, I promise, okay?
I'm coming back.
You can hold on to that.
So, the fact is, sharks,
criminals love to use duct tape
to kidnap people,
but if the victims knew
how easy it is to escape,
many would still be alive.
Ooh.
JOHN: Oh, wow.
These techniques
are simple and effective.
But it's not just spies who can
benefit from this knowledge.
Everyday civilians
can use these secrets
to keep themselves
and their families safer.
What was that secret?
It's the angle.
So, if I got duct-taped
like this,
it wouldn't be as tight.
You got to have your elbows
together and tight.
That way, the friction of
going down at that exact angle,
and then it's gonna pop that.
Impressive.
Sharks, your mission,
should you choose to accept it,
is this.
Invest in me, and together,
we'll build Spy Escape &amp; Evasion
into the largest
and most valuable
training experience
in the country.
Now, which one of you would like
some additional training?
Robert, you want some
additional training right now?
Yes.
Okay.
I love this stuff.
How about you come up here,
and let me grab a chair.
There you go. Perfect.
All right.
Okay.
So,
this is a zip tie --
but not the cheap, little ones
that can break easily.
Oh, you can't
get out of this.
I'm gonna show you.
So, what you do
is put your wrists together.
Okay.
So, Robert...
Wow.
You can just try
and go like that,
and they'll verify that...
it's the real deal.
If you were to look down
at my shoes,
you would see they appear
as regular dress shoes.
Also, the black laces,
they appear
as regular black laces.
What I've done is switched out
my laces with 550 cord,
also called parachute cord.
So, what I would do
is take off my shoelaces,
put them together,
but to save time,
this is what it would form.
So,
what you'd have to do --
and I'll do it for you,
Robert --
you go
right through there.
I'm gonna put this down
over this shoe.
Now, Robert would have
made this.
Now, Robert, you remember
how to ride a bicycle?
Yeah.
I'll get down on the ground
for you.
You're just gonna go like this
and bicycle,
and then
it's gonna pop that.
So just pretend
you're riding a bike.
Oh, my God!
There you go.
I'm amazed!
Hey!
Wow!
That easy.
That's unbelievable.
Thank you.
Wow.
Jason, were you really
a C.I.A. agent?
I am a former C.I.A. officer,
and if I had to tell you
any more,
I'd have to kill you, so...
Tell him more!
[laughs]
Yes, I'm really ex-C.I.A.
You're disposing
a lot of what I think
are proprietary pieces
of information.
I'm just wondering,
if I invested in you,
one day,
you don't show up for work.
[laughs]
Nothing I'm sharing
is confidential.
I've already had a talk
with the agency.
I'm allowed to do this.
I just can't share anything,
obviously --
so, you think the chances
of you getting whacked
and just being
turned into fish food are low.
I'm very good at what I do,
so I'd say it's low.
CUBAN: So, wait.
You haven't told us
what the business is,
what you're trying to do,
so...
Spy escape &amp; evasion
is a two-day course.
The first day, you learn
Spy Escape &amp; Evasion skills
such as how to pick locks,
how to escape rope,
how to escape duct tape,
how to detect and evade
surveillance.
Day 2 is
a field-training exercise,
so you take all the operational
skills from day 1,
you go on a series of missions,
and I have trackers
and surveillance guys
hunting you down to see if
you can complete your missions.
Now, it's a very fun,
exciting course,
but it's also
a practical self-defense course
to keep you safe.
Do you have this in place
right now?
Correct. Yes.
And what are your sales?
$306,000 gross,
$128,000 net.
Was that in one year,
or was that over
a period of time?
That's in one year.
That is year-to-date.
Who is this course
designed for?
Great question.
So, it started out
for high-net-worth individuals,
so I was just doing it
for C.E.O.s, executives.
But then I had -- just everyday
people started taking my course.
How much is the course?
This course is $600.
For two days?
Correct.
And where are you at?
Where are you based?
Cedar City, Utah.
[laughing]
Cedar City, Utah?
Well, actually,
I just moved there last year --
I'm from
the Washington, D.C., area --
and so I was
teaching it there, doing well,
moved out there,
and that's actually
what I want to talk to you about
for the money for.
Okay.
My wife and I have 320 acres
that we're gonna close in
two weeks in Cedar City, Utah,
and I want to build
Spy Escape &amp; Evasion ranch.
I want to make it a premier
self-defense training facility.
[laughing]
Spy escape &amp; evasion ranch!
So, we're gonna teach
the spy courses.
I want to do evasive driving,
which you would love.
And then I want to have
a whole spy obstacle course,
the toughest obstacle
course on the planet.
But that's gonna
require more capital to
build that out, right?
You're gonna need m--
Well, that's what I want
the $100,000 for.
How are you making money
right now off the course?
'cause you don't have
the land developed yet,
so how are you making money
right now?
Right now,
I fly around the country,
so I do a course in Las Vegas,
in Washington, D.C.,
in San Di--
And how do acquire
those customers?
Magazine ads
and then internet.
But what if we want to get
to $20 million in sales, right?
Just Jason's
not gonna be enough.
Who else is out there
that can be
an authoritative teacher
so we could grow this?
Obviously,
I'm gonna find people
with ex-agency background
or ex-military background.
I mean, I've had a ton of these
guys already take my course.
CORCORAN: It really is a mistake
on your part
assuming people
will come out to Utah
to come
and be at your camp,
so I'm out.
All right, well,
I'm sorry to hear that, Barbara.
Jason, what I see
is two different directions.
The Model That seems to work
is when you go to a city,
show up for two days,
train people.
They don't want to fly to Utah,
because it's too expensive.
It quadruples the cost
and takes a lot of time.
I do not want to invest
in the Ponderosa.
[laughter]
But what you guys haven't
let me say is I'm flexible.
I obviously lack the knowledge.
If you guys, who are much
smarter businesspeople than me,
say, "You know what?
This is the model.
It's not the land."
Obviously, I'd be an idiot
not to listen to that,
because you have
the business experience
and the knowledge
that I lack.
It's half-baked.
I'm out.
All right.
Thank you, Kevin.
Jason,
I love this stuff.
I actually think there's
a pretty big market for it.
But I hate the business idea
you came out here with today.
I mean...
Forget about the land, then.
[laughter]
I'm flexible.
I lack the knowledge.
You know, and --
What land?
There goes the Ponderosa.
I'm trying
to be nice to you,
'cause you could be
packing heat, so I don't know.
I am interested in the idea
of selling the seminar,
but you should be filling
entire seminar rooms,
like big hotel rooms.
and I lack the marketing
knowledge to do that.
Well, the other thing
you're lacking
is you don't have
any upsell.
Mm-hmm.
You should have
a subscription -- e-mail
or "Here's the latest threats
in the world" --
Stuff like that.
Right.
But I think you're the guy.
I think you could make it.
I think
you could build that
into a multi-million-dollar
business.
I'll make you
an offer.
Okay.
I'll give you $100,000
for 50%.
First thing we got to do
is you got to create
some material
that you can sell
at these places,
and then
we start testing cities
to see
what the paying point is
and how we can use that money
to build larger seminars.
$100,000 for 50%.
Look, that's the offer
I'm gonna make you,
and I'm only making you
that offer because
it's a completely different plan
than you came out with.
I understand.
Greedy savage, table of one.
Your table's ready.
It's the right business.
If you want to invest
in land in Utah, Daymond...
Are you gonna make him
an offer
or just insult
the only one he's got?
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.
Robert has made Jason an offer
of $100,000
for a 50% stake
in his company.
Look, that's the offer
I'm gonna make you,
and I'm only making
that offer because
it's a completely different plan
than you came out with.
I understand.
Greedy savage, table of one.
Your table's ready.
It's the right business.
If you want to invest
in land in Utah, Daymond...
Are you gonna make him
an offer
or just insult
the only one he's got?
[laughing] I'm so amazed
at the offer he just got.
Daymond? Mark?
Look, I like the kind of
training aspect of it.
That's interesting.
But I don't see that
as the grand slam.
I think the hottest trend
right now in entertainment
is experiences, right?
I could absolutely,
positively see putting together
a fun, you know,
one-day or overnight spy school.
Mm-hmm.
And you're charging 50 bucks
or 60 bucks or 70 bucks,
and you might get
300, 400 people coming through
and doing
all these different things.
O'LEARY:
By the time this is over,
you're gonna have to
send him an invoice
for rewriting
his business plan.
[laughs]
That's okay,
'cause, see,
That's the difference
between us, Kevin.
You just look
and see A, B, and C.
It's a weakness
in the presentation.
I look at A, B, and C
and see X, Y, Z.
That's the difference
between us.
It's a weakness
in the presentation.
No, it's not.
It's just an opportunity.
Like he said,
he's an entrepreneur.
I think
Jason's gonna kidnap
both of you in a moment
if you don't hurry up.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Mark?
Well, talk to Daymond,
'cause I'm uncertain.
I'm on --
I'm on the fence.
Ay. All that
for being on the fence?
Well, ask questions, you know?
You got to learn.
All right. Daymond, sir.
You cannot build
this property.
You have to be able
to move around with it.
And that's fine.
I know your model.
Your model needs, really,
to be for moms and families
and homes
in high-populated areas
where they feel
that they could potentially face
home invasion and other things
of that nature.
Here's my offer --
$150,000 for 45% --
but you got to take the offer
right now.
Not gonna give me
a 24-second shot clock?
No. That's it.
All right. Let's do it. Done.
Good.
Good move.
He's your best partner.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
I appreciate it.
Yeah. You got it.
Thank you.
I like this guy.
Congrats, Jason.
Thank you.
Today, I walked into the tank
with a mission,
and I think it was accomplished.
If we can teach thousands
upon thousands of people
and one person's life
gets saved by this,
then it's definitely worth it.
NARRATOR:
Last season, we watched
Doug Marshall strike a deal
with Mark and Lori
for his unique alternative
to face paint, gameface.
Let's do it.
Put your gameface on!
Put your gameface on, baby!
Whoo-hoo!
NARRATOR:
Let's see how he's doing now.
MARSHALL: Making a deal
with Mark and Lori
was the best thing I could have
done for my company.
Get your gameface on, guys!
Let's go!
My dream has always been
to be able to feature gamefaces
at professional sport
league games around the country.
Mark made that dream come true
by allowing us to give out
thousands of gamefaces
to his most loyal mav fans.
Hey, Mark.
What's up, dawg?
[chuckles]
Good to see you.
CUBAN: When we first did
the deal on "Shark Tank,"
I knew it'd be a winner,
but, you know,
it's good to get validation.
When you bring it out
to the mavs games
and the kids go nuts over it,
we're showing them
on the jumbotron
and everybody's going crazy
seeing them, this is exciting.
I know Lori and I
are really fired up.
Showing your fan pride
has just changed 180 degrees
with gameface.
MARSHALL:
We had been working on this
for five, six years
and slowly being accepted.
Since "Shark Tank,"
all of a sudden, bam --
everybody wants it.
In our first year of business,
we did $6,700 in sales.
In the 10-month period
since airing,
we've done $200,000 in sales.
In order to keep up with demand,
we had to change
our manufacturing process.
With the finalization
of the product,
we're able to project sales
of $2- to $20 million
in the next 12 months.
The possibilities for gameface
are endless.
We're gonna have them
in all the colors
of all the different teams.
Our next step
is to launch licensed product
from the NFL, NBA,
NHL, and NCAA.
We're even working with
international soccer sponsors
for the 2014 world cup.
Those orders
could be in the millions.
ALL: Defense!
MARSHALL: So many people
want a small business
or just have an idea.
I had an idea,
created a business,
went in front of the sharks,
and it's changed our life
beyond our wildest dreams.
[crowd cheers]
NARRATOR: Next up is
a former wrestling superstar
with a product
that changed his life.
Hello, sharks.
