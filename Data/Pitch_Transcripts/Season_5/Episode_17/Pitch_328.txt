Hello, sharks.
My name is Erica Barrett.
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,
and I'm the founder and C.E.O.
Of Southern culture
artisan foods,
a breakfast lifestyle brand.
I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange
for a 25% equity stake
in my company.
One morning, I was simply
making breakfast for my husband
and had to run to the store
to grab ingredients
to make our all-time favorite,
strawberry pancakes.
I wanted to use organic flour,
pure cane sugar,
fresh strawberries,
and, sharks, what's pancakes
without great vanilla?
I got to the register,
and my bill was close to $35.
Stop the madness!
I hadn't even
bought the bacon yet.
And I thought to myself,
"Why isn't there a quality
flavored pancake-and-waffle mix
currently on the shelf?"
So, with no formal
culinary experience,
I created
our flagship product --
shortstacks
pancake &amp; waffle mix.
We feature unique flavors,
such as banana pudding,
oatmeal-raisin cookie,
and even bourbon salted pecan.
We use organic,
all-natural ingredients,
and because our mixes contain
no powdered dairy,
I've literally masterminded
a product
that's great for all diets.
But enough about my breakfasts.
I have some samples
for you to try.
We're about to eat.
Yes, breakfast.
Absolutely. Feed us!
All right.
Oh, wow.
Here you go, Robert.
Oh, wow.
Just looking at it...
Barbara.
Thank you.
Are these
all the same flavors?
They have
no carbs at all.
Yes, it's our banana pudding,
our best seller.
CORCORAN: Thank you so much.
HERJAVEC: This is banana?
Banana-pudding pancake.
It smells fantastic.
Mr. Wonderful. Here you go.
Banana-pudding pancake.
JOHN: Thank you.
Here you go, Mark.
Yes, Ma'am.
Mmm.
Barbara, a moment on the lips,
a lifetime on your hips.
[chuckles]
It's worth it.
Mmm!
Sharks, we've had
quite a bit of success.
Now I'm ready to take this brand
to the next level.
There's only one question
I have for you.
This is so good.
Who's ready to take a bite
out of the most important meal
of the day?
Mmm.
Erica,
tell us about your sales.
Well,
within our first 12 months,
we did $100,000 in sales.
Mmm.
We had gross profits
of $62,000.
Where'd you sell
that $100,000?
Well, Nordstrom picked us up
immediately
after we went
to our first trade show.
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
also picked up our product.
You've gotten into
some high-end retailers.
Absolutely.
And have they reordered
from you?
Nordstrom, we're working
on an order with them
for the holiday season.
They usually do food
around the holidays, like --
typically, people pick them up
as a gift item.
Uh, we do have Whole Foods.
I do Williams-Sonoma
artisans market once a month.
Is this very expensive versus
just traditional pancake mix?
What does it cost?
Well, it costs me anywhere
between 99 cents and $1.50
to make the product.
It sells for about $7.99.
Great margins.
How many waffles
does that make?
12 pancakes
or 4 large waffles.
That's a very, very high price
for that small quantity.
Can I see the packaging,
Erica?
Yes. Absolutely.
So, Erica,
if I'm walking into Whole Foods
and I see
four products there...
Mm-hmm.
...What's the difference
between yours
and the other three?
Why would I pick yours up?
Well, the first thing
about our product
is that we use
premium ingredients.
Well, you've got
the Southern thing going, right?
Absolutely.
So that's the whole thing.
You've kind of created
a little vertical niche, right?
A niche, absolutely.
Southern gourmet.
Or just a great,
quality pancake
that's not filled
with chemicals.
We use real blueberries.
So, my concern
about growing this business is,
how do I scale it?
I don't think
you have a permanent listing
in any of the stores
you talked to me about.
Uh, Whole Foods -- we've been
in Whole Foods for a year.
Okay, how many times
have they reordered?
It's a local -- it's a local
Whole Foods, correct?
Regional, yeah.
We're in 12 stores.
And how many times
have they reordered?
They reorder every week.
And why can't you get
a national rollout on that?
Well, Whole Foods told us
that they want us to build
a great track record.
We couldn't get in contact
with the regional buyers,
so we hustled our way
into every single store.
We called up every single
team leader and said,
"I guarantee,
if you purchase this product,
you're gonna get reorders."
There hasn't been anything
in my life --
my mom had me at 16 years old,
I'm a first-generation
college student --
that I've set out to achieve
that I have not done.
I mean, I haven't --
I think I take naps.
I won't say that I go to sleep.
But I'm obsessed
with my business,
because this is
what I'm here to do.
That's awesome.
Good for you.
If this category
takes off,
why wouldn't you think
the big brands,
everybody out there,
would say...
so good.
..."I'll just create
my own brand"?
I think you already have
competitors in this category,
don't you?
Well --
Yeah, there's competitors.
Um, there's --
Well, Kevin --
Kevin's trying to say
the big boys
are gonna wipe you out,
but the big boys already
know about this category.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
HERJAVEC: Yeah, right?
Absolutely.
But Kevin
  always says that.
And I want to know
the answer.
I think what makes me different
is that,
you know, traditional
manufacturers have made
their breakfast products
the same way for 80 to 85 years,
but people change.
People have
dietary restrictions.
People are vegan.
People are lactose-intolerant.
But I want to hear more
about the ones
who are currently
in your space,
the ones
who are making other products.
Yeah, the premium ones
you compete with --
do they not make the product
the same way?
They use powdered dairy.
So, your claim is
you're the purest of the pure.
Absolutely.
So, you've done a remarkable job
in 16 months.
You're making money.
Your packaging is amazing.
Why are you here?
What do you need the money for?
I need to fill orders.
Okay.
QVC just sent me an e-mail
this morning.
They want to pick me up
for their fourth-quarter lineup.
They believe that we can sell
50,000 to 75,000.
Let me just
slow you down, there.
I've had
so many food products on QVC.
Mm-hmm.
They have sold
wildly successfully.
Uh-huh.
And you know what
the problem with them are?
The margins are so skinny
that you basically break even.
Mm-hmm.
The way to make money
in the food space,
which I learned the hard way
over and over and over again,
is to get into
the big-box stores.
That's where
the margins are fat.
And you know
what I've learned?
I've learned that
boutique businesses like this...
Uh-huh.
...aren't sold there.
We were actually approached
by target,
that wants to start us off
at 50 to 100 test stores.
You're under a lucky star.
Where do you manufacture this?
We manufacture the product
ourself.
What do you mean, "yourself"?
Wait a minute --
you don't have a commer--
in your own kitchen?
You box it, you make it?
You don't have
a commercial kitchen?
We have our own facilities --
3,000 square feet.
Oh.
Why wouldn't you go
to a commercial kitchen?
Because they could
reduce your costs dramatically.
I think what we're doing
that's so unique, Mr. wonderful,
they can't produce this.
They want to put --
They want to put me in a box.
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
Just hear me out on this.
'cause all of us have food deals
in our portfolios now.
Okay.
I have learned that
a commercial co-packer kitchen
is the only way to go.
Your costs are reduced
by 30%.
Okay.
Erica,
I'll start to simplify things.
You're amazing,
but I'm not really
into the gourmet-food business.
If it's more than $3
or more than a hot dog
at 7-Eleven,
that's too much for me,
and, you know,
it's not my kind of thing,
so for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
But awesome.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Erica,
I think that you made
a really fatal and critical
flaw here today.
Uh, you didn't give me
enough food.
[laughter]
Unbelievable.
Thank you.
Unbelievable.
But here's the one thing
I've learned
from my food investments.
Yes.
The food business
is a really tough business.
I see this
as a high-end niche product,
but not a big business.
For that reason, I'm out.
Thank you.
Look,
I'm gonna make you an offer,
but it's gonna have a bunch
of contingencies in it.
Okay.
Which you're gonna want
to say no to right away.
I haven't heard anyb--
Silence.
Silence, Barbara, because
you're not making any offer.
You might as well listen
to where the money is
for the moment, all right?
You can't do what you want to do
in 3,000 square feet,
so contingency number 1,
before I give you $100,000,
is that you're gonna
have to work with a co-packer.
You're gonna have to.
Okay.
Secondly, I'm not interested
in any equity.
I want a dollar a unit.
Oh! [groans]
Silence.
I want a dollar a unit
until I recoup my $100,000,
and then
I'll go down to 50 cents --
the exact same offer
I gave Dani and Tracey
for Wicked Cupcakes.
They love me now --
Love me, all right?
Okay.
That's why
I'm called Mr. Wonderful.
Erica,
what's your cost per unit?
About anywhere
from 92 cents to $1.50.
So you're gonna pay Kevin
more than it costs you --
You know what?
No, you don't get it.
Because when you go
to the co-packer,
one third of that dollar's
gonna be recouped.
That doesn't make
any sense.
She's paying you --
She's paying you more.
I've made an offer.
If you want to make an offer,
Robert, go ahead and make one.
She's paying you more than
it costs to make the product.
You are so lucky you've met me.
You have no idea.
So you can learn
what not to do.
Let's hear your offer.
You -- oh, you're out.
I forgot.
Now, how about you,
Daymond?
NARRATOR: Two sharks are out,
Erica has an offer from Kevin,
and Daymond is on the fence.
How about you,
Daymond?
I'll make you an offer.
CUBAN: Thank God.
And I don't even know
if I really want to
make you an offer.
I just don't want to see you
in bed with this character.
But I'll make you
a $100,000 offer for 40%.
You thief!
You really do
come in on a broom.
No, not at all.
And the reason for that
is I don't think you really know
what's ahead of you.
You haven't dealt with
the stores that don't pay you.
You haven't dealt with QVC,
where if a customer complains,
wham --
They slam it back to you
and they charge you
for the shipping.
Okay.
You haven't really gone
to the sophomore year,
where you are about to have to
overcome tremendous hurdles
that almost put every one of my
entrepreneurs out of business.
Okay.
It's problem after problem
after problem.
You know
one of the biggest problems?
You got to listen to this
every day.
Which is a whole lot better
than that.
[laughs]
O'LEARY: So much jealousy here,
you know?
Erica, so...
I, uh,
I-I'm one of the only sharks
without food
in my portfolio,
so one of my main agendas
this year
is to put some food
in my portfolio.
Looks like
you haven't missed many meals.
[chuckles] No. In my stomach,
they're all there.
I'm a hard worker.
I'm a hard worker, Daymond.
You know,
but what I see here
is that you do have
a horrible offer with Kevin.
I believe you have a great
potential partner with Barbara,
so I'm gonna step out.
What do you think, Erica?
What do you think?
Barbara,
I would like to counter.
Fair.
Is it possible
we could do 30%
in exchange for the $100,000?
I'm a hard worker.
No, I would have to stay firm
with the 40%.
Oh, come on, Barbara.
Again, because --
Wow.
Because I know how much work
is involved in this
from this point forward.
35%.
[clicks tongue]
Afraid not.
But I want you
to be happy with the deal.
Barbara!
Have a heart, Barbara.
Come on.
You can make 35%.
I'm a hard worker.
Now you know
what evil looks like on Earth.
No way we can do 35% and just
kind of meet in the middle?
You savage.
I mean, a little bit more
than the middle?
I'll make you
a lot of money, Barbara.
I'm a hard worker.
I have the right to be here.
I've worked so hard.
CUBAN, JOHN, AND HERJAVEC:
Barbara! Barbara!
Barbara! Barbara! Barbara!
BARRETT: Come on, Barbara.
Come on, Barbara!
O'LEARY: Erica.
Abandon this madness.
Do the Mr. Wonderful deal.
What's 5%?
Come on, Barbara.
Come on, Barbara!
Well...38%.
[laughs]
You got a deal.
[all cheer]
All right!
And you don't have a deal,
Mr. Wonderful!
Yeah!
I'm okay with that.
Yeah!
CUBAN: Way to go, Erica!
Whoo, baby!
And I love pancakes.
Awesome.
Thank you so much!
Congratulations, Erica.
Thank you.
Excellent job.
CORCORAN: Looking forwar.
To working with you, baby.
Thank you.
Yes! [laughs]
I can't believe it.
Flattened Mr. Wonderful
like a pancake.
Take that, Mr. Meanie pants.
[chuckles]
O'LEARY: I'm okay with it.
You'll never get your money
out of that --
ever. ever.
That woman hated you
on sight.
She loved me.
I didn't want to give up
that much equity,
but I trust Barbara,
I know that she cares
about my well-being,
and I know
that I'm gonna be a millionaire.
