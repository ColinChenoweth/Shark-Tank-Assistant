I'm former WWE world champion
diamond Dallas Page,
and today,
we just broke $3 million.
Dang.
NARRATOR:
They're ready to invest
using their own money...
I'll make you
a $100,000 offer
for 40%.
You thief!
NARRATOR: ...And they're willing
to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
I want a dollar a unit.
That doesn't make
any sense.
If you want to make
an offer, Robert,
go ahead and make one.
You are so lucky you've met me.
You have no idea.
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary

into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert
who grew
his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu,
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
I'm former WWE world champion
diamond Dallas Page.
And I'm Dallas' partner,
Steve yu.
Our company's ddp yoga,
and today, we're seeking
$200,000 for 5% of the company.
Ddp yoga was created
out of necessity.
You see, I didn't even become
a professional wrestler
until I was 35 years old.
My career did not take off
until I was 40.
By the time I was 42,
I was at the top
of the wrestling business,
and bang!
I blew my back out
so badly
that three different
back specialists said
my wrestling career
was over.
So,
when it was suggested
that I might try yoga
to heal my body,
I got to be honest --
I was like, "Yoga?
I'm a guy who wouldn't
be caught dead doing yoga!"
But I was desperate
to save my career,
so I gave it a shot,
and in less than three months,
I was back in the ring.
I proved the doctors wrong,
and at 43 years young,
I was the heavyweight
champ of the world --
not once, not twice,
but three times.
You see, sharks, ddp yoga --
it ain't your mama's yoga.
I combine the very best
of my old-school training
with sports-rehabilitation
techniques, yoga positions,
and dynamic resistance
to create the most
complete workout on the planet.
It will dramatically increase
your flexibility
and strengthen your core
like never before --
all with
minimal joint impact.
No other workout
can make that statement.
Now, Dallas has spent years
developing this program,
and we officially launched
ddp yoga two years ago,
and we couldn't be more inspired
by people doing the workouts.
Now, before you start
to grill us,
let me show you
what ddp yoga did for me.
When I blew my back out,
this is
where my flexibility was.
Today, this is where
my flexibility is.
[exhales deeply]
Wow.
PAGE: And being able
to stand here and talk to you,
at 6'4", 226 pounds,
and 57 years young,
this is core strength
and balance
at a whole different level.
This is ddp yoga.
Now, to show you that
just about anyone can do this,
let me tell you about a guy
named Arthur boorman --
disabled veteran
that was 5'6", 297 pounds
when I first got with him
and couldn't walk
without the aid of knee braces,
back brace, or wraparound canes.
Let me introduce you to him.
Arthur, come on down here.
He not only lost 140 pounds
in 10 months,
he lost the knee braces,
the back brace,
and the wraparound canes --
can not only walk, but run.
CORCORAN: Whoa, no way.
This is not the same guy.
This is -.
This is the same guy.
Wow.
CUBAN:
Good for you, buddy.
Former staff sergeant
Arthur boorman.
Wow.
What a beast.
Over 10 million views
on his video.
Really?
Really.
JOHN: Wow. Congrats.
Arthur, you swear to God
that's you in the video?
That is me in the video.
CUBAN: Yeah, it looks like him.
Yeah.
I mean, face-wise.
Amazing.
Wow.
Arthur,
why don't you show them
some of the things
that you can do now?
He couldn't stand on two legs,
never mind one leg.
Good for you, Arthur.
And his flexibility --
cold.
CUBAN: Oh, damn.
JOHN: Whoa.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
PAGE: 53 years young.
And how did you find
Dallas?
Well, y-you kind of have to
understand how desperate I was.
I was really bad-off.
I could not -- I couldn't
do anything on my own.
My wife had to dress me
in the morning.
I could not
live like that anymore,
and I tried different things,
and nothing worked.
So, I was on the internet,
typing in different things,
and one time, I just typed in
"Yoga, broken back" --
up popped
Dallas Page.
CORCORAN: Wow.
Hm.
Okay, so, let's get into
the business, Dallas, guys.
Sure.
Yeah, the first year,
we -- we pretty much beat
our expectations.
We were hoping to do maybe
a quarter of a million dollars,
and we actually sold
$2.6 million.
Oh, wow.
JOHN: In the first year?
Today,
we just broke $3 million.
Dang.
YU:
We broke $3 million.
PAGE:
And that's with DVDs.
Well, what was your profit
on the $3 million yielded?
We netted $890,000.
Before you paid yourselves
anything?
Oh, we paid ourselves.
So, that's after
you paid yourselves.
Oh, yeah.
So, if I gave you
$200,000,
how exactly
would you spend that money?
We would put that
towards building
the first mobile application
for ddp yoga.
So, it's still being
sold in a DVD and
a book format, right?
Right.
That's right.
So, where do you come from,
Steve?
How -- how did you end up,
you know, working with Dallas?
I started trying to do
filmmaking to create stories
that would inspire people
to change their lives,
and then, you know,
Dallas and I spoke about it,
and I said,
"Well, let me --
"You know, I've got
a lot of documentary footage.
Let me try
to retell Arthur's story."
I'll tell you
what's really fascinating me
and concerning me.
We see
a lot of exercise programs
coming into the Shark Tank.
All the models we've seen,
including the ones
that have been successful,
have used an ingredient
that's very expensive --
infomercials.
They bought remnant time
on cable.
That's the barrier to entry
in this space.
Yes.
And so what I'm concerned about
in looking at your deal
is you don't have
any of that in place.
Yes, we do.
We start airing our Doc--
not an infomercial,
it's a docu-mercial --
we're reinventing
the infomercial.
Are you buying
the airtime?
Yes.
We've already bought it.
We're testing now.
We're testing right now.
CORCORAN: Wait. How much money
did you spend on it?
Well, they've got $890,000
in profits.
That's what you do
with profits, right?
Yeah, so, we -- yeah,
we didn't have
that flexibility before.
Reinvest.
JOHN: So,
here's what I think, Dallas.
I think that you're asking
for $200,000, 5%.
You're valuing the company
at $4 million.
Really, that's not bad,
to be very honest.
Um, but I've invested
in some fitness brands before --
PAGE: I really appreciate
your time,
and you're gonna watch ddp yoga
become a household name.
YU: Absolutely.
You're gonna be going,
"Oh, God!
Why wasn't I
a part of that?"
Thank you so much, guys.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
See ya. Bang!
Appreciate it.
[laughter]
CUBAN: Good job.
Good effort, guys.
I was almost gonna
have to hold Dallas back
when he offered,
you know,
he wanted
50% of our company.
oh, boy.
I was eyeing him up
right there, man.
Bang!
[laughing]
Mr. Wonderful.
Not so wonderful
no more, bro.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur
with an easy, gourmet way
to make
a favorite breakfast treat.
