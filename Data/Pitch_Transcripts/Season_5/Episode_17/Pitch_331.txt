My name is Ryan Carpenter.
I live in Portland, Oregon,
with my turtle, Mo,
and I'm the owner of Moberi.
I love living in Portland.
Portland is the place
where weird ideas thrive,
and what I do is definitely
a little weird,
and people
really like that here.
Leading a healthy lifestyle
is something I've done
for a long time.
I frequently ride my bike around
to the farmers market,
picking up fresh produce.
Can't wait to juice these.
They're gonna go great
in the smoothies.
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.
My goal was to start a business
with $500.
Then, I found a new way
to use old bikes,
and I found a way to mix
my healthy and active lifestyle
and share it with the world.
Standing out in Portland
is not an easy thing to do,
but I've created a product
that turns heads
and gets people excited.
I've put all my savings and
then some into this business,
but for me,
it's not just about the money.
It's about the chance
to do something
that I really like doing
for a living.
My dream for this business
goes so much farther
than my resources can take it.
With an investment
from the sharks,
I can take it to the next level
and make Mo proud.
Hey, sharks.
My name is Ryan Carpenter,
my business is Moberi,
and I'm looking for $50,000
in exchange
for a 15% stake in my company.
Welcome to Moberi,
the first bicycle-powered
smoothie-and-juice cart,
from Portland, Oregon.
Food trucks, bicycles,
and healthy juice bars
are major trends
sweeping the nation right now,
and we combine all three
into an interactive experience
unlike any other.
Using fresh greens,
fruits, and superfoods,
customers come to us to
pedal-power their own smoothies,
or we do it for them.
[laughter]
Either way, the experience
is always fun,
And the product is delicious.
And with a little bit
of your guys' help,
we can take this pedal-powered
concept to a whole new level.
But before
we get down to business,
who wants to come up
and pedal their own smoothie?
Me!
Daymond? All right.
Come on up.
[chuckles]
I want a piece of this.
Mark.
All right.
Daymond,
why don't you hop on that one?
See if that works for you.
Oh, that's funny.
HERJAVEC: Oh, wow.
My, oh, my.
JOHN: Oh, my goodness.
This is pretty funny.
Go, Daymond! Go, Daymond!
CARPENTER: Hold on.
All right, guys.
The trick is to start slow
and then pick up the speed
as we get going.
[laughs]
Nice. I like this.
It's pretty smooth, right?
Yeah.
Five, four, three, two, one!
HERJAVEC: Mark, go faster!
That's it.
Power, not speed.
Nice job, guys.
That's cool.
Sweet.
Did it work?
All right.
There you go.
[laughs]
That's all yours.
There you go.
It's good.
[laughs]
That is really good.
Is it good? Nice.
That is really good.
JOHN: Wow.
That is good.
This is good.
All right. Robert?
Take one of each, here.
The green one here
is the Johnny Utah.
That's got kale,
pineapple, and mint.
HERJAVEC: Wow.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
This thing's amazing.
Wow. The green is great.
Yummy.
All right.
Okay, Ryan.
Quick question.
Sure.
Are you nuts?
[laughs] Uh...
O'LEARY: Think about
the capacity constraint.
Get five guys walking up there
to buy their smoothie,
and they all
have to ride a bicycle?
So, we have one bicycle
inside our current cart,
and we have one bike outside
on our food-cart patio.
CORCORAN: And how would
you even come up
with this
really ridiculous idea?
Ridiculously great idea?
I saw
how a Guatemalan nonprofit
was turning bicycles
into washing machines
and concrete mixers,
and I thought
smoothies would go over
a little bit better
in the Portland market.
What are sales, say?
What have you got for numbers?
So, so far this year,
we've sold $70,000.
We'll be at $100,000
by the end of the year.
Do you have
a single location?
I have
one full-time location,
and I have a mobile cart
that I use for catering.
So, tell me
about the one location.
It's an 8x16 trailer.
I'd say
about 80% of my customers
let us do the pedaling.
What do you charge
for a smoothie?
So, the average
is 6 bucks.
And why do you think
this is gonna become popular,
with all the other
competitions you have --
the jamba juices
and everybody in the world?
Because it's -- it's different.
It's interactive. It's fun.
But, Ryan, after I do it once,
do I care?
Yeah. You do.
Nobody comes into our spot
in a bad mood
and leaves in a bad mood.
They love it.
They come back --
What's it cost for the bike?
So, these particular bikes
ran me about $2,000.
Each?
Each.
That thing cannot cost $2,000,
even with the blender.
These are
my high-end bikes.
My originals, I made
out of Schwinn exercise bikes.
It cost me about 400 bucks
to make one of those bikes.
There was a few problems
with that.
I couldn't lower the seat
all the way down for kids.
These bikes are safer,
more predictable,
and they're gonna give me
long-term return.
But the prem--
the premise is nuts,
because it's a
capacity-constraint function.
I mean, do you have
a real blender back there?
No.
W-what are you, nuts?!
That's part of
the beauty of it.
You don't need a real blender.
No, no, it's not beautiful.
It's ugly!
You really don't.
It's -- it's not.
It's beautiful,
and -- and it's efficient.
I can bust out
as many smoothies on these
in the same timeframe
as a busy Jamba Juice.
Versus a blender?
Now, what do you -- what do you
plan on doing with the money?
With $50,000,
that'll give me enough money
to open two more carts
just like that.
Never mind that, Ryan.
What are you planning
to do with your life?
Downtown --
[laughter]
It's like --
I'm just trying
to stay in shape
and get a smoothie afterward.
[laughter]
Brian,
this is so crazy
that it might actually
be brilliant.
It is.
Brian, I think
it's a very happy business,
and that,
I have to hand to you,
but I have to tell you,
it doesn't make any sense.
Do you guys want to talk
about the numbers?
I'm profitable.
No, you gave us
the numbers.
It's just not investable.
And this is our first year.
I know. I'm out.
Daymond,
you love healthy foods.
You love --
you love to be outside.
JOHN: Brian,
you look like a gerbil,
working at the place, man.
[laughs]
I-I love -- I love being
a gerbil in that machine.
It's great.
[laughter]
O'LEARY: You know, Ryan,
I can time-travel,
and I've gone
to the future.
Here's the headline --
"Man dies of cardiac arrest
blending smoothies."
[laughter]
I'm out.
How long did it take you
to make that $70,000?
Well, since January.
And how much did you net?
We're netting 20%,
and we're anticipating
$150,000 worth of sales
from this cart next year,
$150,000 for our second cart,
and $150,000 for our third.
I think, you know,
it's very, very clever.
What do you mean,
"clever"?
I don't see it scaling.
I'm out.
Ryan, I think
it's a cute little business.
This looks like
it belongs on,
you know,
on an island or something.
It's really fun.
You know, piña coladas
being made out of it.
I just --
Yeah, that's true.
I could -- on a beach
or something, yeah?
You know, Gilligan actually used
one of these bikes.
[laughs]
Exactly.
But as for me...
I'm out.
Thank you.
I love the idea.
What I don't like
is the cost of the bikes.
Right.
Mark, he doesn't
make the bikes!
I know.
That's the catch.
If you were the bike guy instead
of the juice-and-smoothie guy,
I would be all over it.
I -- they're not doing
what I'm doing.
I-I think
you're innovative.
You took a concept
that I didn't even know existed,
the blender bike,
and turned it into a business.
If you were the bike guy
and you found an application
and smoothies
was the first application,
I'd be all over it,
but you're not,
and so for that reason, I'm out.
All right.
Well, thank you, Mark.
I appreciate that.
Good luck.
Thank you, guys.
Thanks, Ryan.
Take care.
It needs
to be on an island.
Making margaritas --
you got that one right.
Stupid.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a former C.I.A. agent
who wants to expose
the tricks of the trade.
Billy Blanks Jr.,
cowboy Ryan --
and I'm finding out
about all the challenges.
It is a massive, massive drain
on my time and energy,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Thank you very much.
You guys know
as well as I do --
and I think
that's why you're here --
that there will be
a transition.
It's gonna get more difficult
to sell DVDs.
The difficult factor
for me
is that
when you transition to online,
the pricing, the profitability,
the risk/reward
is 180 degrees different,
right?
So coming in,
we're creating a new company.
It's just too great
a risk profile for me.
Sure.
And so while I say,
"Good job, good effort,"
I have to say,
for that reason, I'm out.
Thanks. Appreciate that.
Thank you,
and congrats, guys.
I don't like investing
in businesses that are
based on trends.
All the up and down,
it just doesn't work for me.
I fear that your big hit
already happened
on the backs
of this great story.
I don't have the faith
to go up and down
on the roller-coaster ride
with you.
I'm out.
The challenge I have is,
as Mark said,
is you want to create
a brand-new business.
You're gonna burn
all your profit
going into
the infomercial route.
The thing about that,
Robert,
is we're not going
into this infomercial world
and just
dumping our money in.
We're -- we're being
very cautious.
Maybe. I just -- I'm --
I'm not believing in that route.
And for the 5% for $200,000
when you're making $900,000,
you know,
I just don't see it.
I'm out.
Well, Mr. Wonderful?
O'LEARY: Yeah. Here's --
here's where I'm at.
[chuckles]
It's rare that I --
I've got a, you know,
an angel and a devil
on my shoulders
saying, "Do this deal.
Just ask for more."
You're offering me $200,000
for 5%.
$200,000 for 50%
would be more along...
[laughs]
YU: Yeah. [laughs]
I'm a good salesman, too,
and the reason you'd do this
is I have to write another check
and another check
and another check after
you figure out the metrics.
Yeah, so then he'll own 70%,
and then 80%, then 120%.
That's why
they call me Mr. Wonderful.
You made $900,000
this year.
You're offering that?
God. What an insult.
Unfortunately, the angst
I have about the future
can't be ignored,
so, for that reason, I'm out.
