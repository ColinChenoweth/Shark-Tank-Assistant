My name is Irene,
and this is my husband, Noam.
We're from Los Angeles,
California.
Our company
is cm national,
and our newest item
is Bambooee,
which will revolutionize
the future of paper towels.
We're asking for $200,000
for 10% equity in our company.
This is Bambooee.
It's like a paper towel
but made out of bamboo.
It comes in a roll,
and it's perforated.
And it fits perfectly
on your paper-towel dispenser.
One roll of Bambooee
with 20 sheets
replaces up to 286 rolls
of paper towels!
No!
GREINER: Wow.
Because --
because they're reusable
and machine-washable
up to 100 times!
[laughs]
We created Bambooee
because we really wanted
To make a difference
in the planet
by offering people
an alternative to paper towels.
Let's do a comparison
over here.
Here I have
a regular paper towel.
And here
we have a Bambooee.
[laughter]
And like regular paper towels,
Bambooees are super absorbent.
Look.
They don't drip.
Bambooees are stronger
than paper towels.
[laughs]
Paper towels
just rip.
Oops.
Regular paper towels
don't work when they're wet.
Bambooees are the only towel
that will work while still damp.
They'll work in your kitchen,
your bathroom, your shower,
your stainless-steel
refrigerator, even your car.
They don't scratch.
And look.
[tile squeaks]
It's bone-dry.
[laughter]
And like
regular paper towels,
You can wash them in the sink,
you can wring them,
and you can reuse them.
Isn't that amazing?
Amazing!
Bambooee!
But wait!
There's more!
There's more!
[laughs]
We've recently developed
a floor-scrubbing Bambooee
that's reusable,
as well.
Bambooee Sweeps is a Bambooee
but with scrubbing dots.
They fit perfectly
on your swiffer,
and the most amazing part
is they leave no chemical
residue on your floors,
unlike regular disposable
swiffer pads.
Wow!
Can we see it?
Of course!
GREINER: [chuckles]
Now, watch this. I'm gonna use
a little bit of crayon here.
So, we're gonna
make a big mess.
Now, watch carefully.
Now, you can use
any cleaner.
So, you can see how effective
those scrubbing dots are.
Now, watch.
What you will notice is that
it will scrub, it will clean,
and it will absorb
without scratching,
whether you have wood, tile,
linoleum, even stone.
And look --
it picks up everything.
Those dots are crazy!
GREINER: [laughs]
And when they get dirty,
you just toss them
in the washing machine.
They wash up to 100 times,
and they're bleachable, too.
Bambooee!
Our products are made from 100%
sustainably sourced bamboo,
and with every roll we sell,
we plant a tree.
Sharks, who's ready to clean up,
plant millions of trees,
and make tons
of sustainable money?!
O'LEARY: Wow!
Bambooee!
That was great.
Are you selling any Bambooees
right now?
Yes, we currently, uh,
have been selling it
for almost two years.
And? Sales?
Last year, we sold $122,000
with Bambooee.
This year, we are hitting
about $300,000.
So, what'd you --
Is Bambooee
actually bamboo cloth?
CORCORAN: It is.
IRENE: It's made
out of bamboo.
Which is not -- which is not
proprietary unique.
They make that today?
O'LEARY:
Yes, they do.
It's available commercially.
So, bamboo paper --
Well, they --
they make bamboo --
they make bamboo towels,
you know, to dry yourself.
And cloths.
And
they make cloths.
Yes.
The product is --
But is he right?
Are there rolls of bamboo cloth
out there currently available?
Not this --
not this exact kind of roll.
Can you explain that
to us?
It's -- it's not
the same kind of fiber.
We have a proprietary
manufacturing process.
But no patent, of course.
Yes?
And we have -- we have
a patent pending as
of -- as of right now.
When you came out,
you said you have a company.
Yes.
Yes.
We are offering
our whole company.
Our whole company last year
sold $1.6 million.
Wow.
GREINER: Wow.
Oh, that changes
the game.
Wow.
Can we touch it?
Yes, absolutely.
Okay, let --
Tell us what else
the other company does.
We sell a variety
of cleaning cloths.
What was your profit
on that?
$900,000.
CORCORAN: Wow.
Good for you.
Wow.
You could take that money
and plant a lot of trees.
[laughter]
Why do you need
our money?
We think that if we partner up
with one of you,
okay, we can actually
take this to the next level.
You've made an assumption that
people are going to treat this
as a replacement for paper
towels. I don't buy it.
If you're make -- gonna
make an environmental claim...
I guess --
...what you should be saying is,
"It's degradable,
just like paper is."
But to -- to say you're gonna
wash this and reuse it
means your footprint
is very heavy,
because you're using
electricity.
You're actually
using detergent.
That's going into
the water supply.
I don't buy
that part of the argument.
HERJAVEC: No, I-I buy
the argument,
'cause in Europe, they don't use
a lot of paper towels.
I think people
feel guilty.
They use the reu--
the washable stuff in Europe.
Yeah.
I think that's true.
I want to show you
that Bambooees,
actually, when you launder them,
they become softer.
And they don't scratch.
I have found out from --
Do people use this
on their faces?
They use them on their --
We are working on a --
on a line for -- for cosmetics.
Thank you. Hmm.
I'll share hers.
I'll share hers.
NOAM: Okay.
Now, they become softer.
I have professional detailers
that use them.
It's actually
less stretchy...
They don't get --
Yes.
...than the original.
They get softer,
more absorbent.
They're softer.
They don't scratch a car.
May I see that roll,
Noam, please?
I want to see
what it looks like.
Of course, of course.
What is the price point of one
roll, compared to a paper towel?
So, that roll
is our feature item.
We have
many different skus,
but that roll sells
between $12.99 and $15
in retail and online.
And, Irene, if that was paper,
how much would it sell for?
Um, paper-towel rolls are
between $1.50 to $3.50 a roll.
Wow.
So, it's way more.
Unless you buy --
Yes.
and there's another --
Yes, but you can go through a
roll of paper towels in a blink.
In a wink.
Yeah.
That says it's equal
to 286 paper-towel rolls.
That's right.
NOAM: Let me -- let me
just say one thing, okay?
You are not buying
just a product.
You're buying
three things.
You're buying us,
okay?
We're the hardest-working team
in the industry.
We've been together
for 16 years.
O'LEARY: I believe you.
But I have to look
at the merits of the in--
Number two --
number two.
There's three things.
There's three things.
Number two, okay?
We have an innovative product
like nothing that you've seen
in the industry.
Look, you're a great salesman.
I'm -- I'm giving you --
There's a third one.
There's a third one.
There's a third one.
I'm giving you --
Let me --
What's number three?
Number three is this is not
the only product we have.
We're creating new ways
of using paper.
We're doing toilet paper.
Washable toilet paper?
Don't tell me it's washable
toilet paper.
GREINER: Now, wait.
That's not reusable.
No, of course not.
This is disposable.
Not reusable.
[laughter]
Disposable toilet paper,
of course.
O'LEARY: You are definitely
a great salesman.
I'm a salesman.
I feel the kindred spirit.
I rarely say that
on "Shark Tank."
You're very good.
I have to look at the investment
for me as an investor, okay?
I don't find it
very compelling for me
because I don't want to go
through the educational curve
to accelerate this product.
And the other way
for me to do this
would be to put debt
on your company,
and this 10% tip
you're offering me is just --
But you've accepted
from smaller companies.
You have the opportunity
by us being a bigger company --
All right, look. you know,
you're very compelling.
Here's an offer for you,
all right?
This is the only way
I would do it,
'cause 10%
means nothing to me.
I'll lend you $200,000.
I'll put an 8% interest rate on
it, which is very reasonable.
And you'll give me the 10%
for incentive for me to do it.
That's an offer.
Okay.
He's a loan shark, in short.
I'll lend you $200,000.
I'll put an 8% interest rate
on it, which is very reasonable.
And you'll give me the 10%
for incentive for me to do it.
That's an offer.
He's a loan shark, in short.
The thing is, 10% --
it means nothing to me --
nothing.
Well, if it means nothing,
don't take it.
You're making a lot of noise,
Mr. Cuban.
Why don't you make an offer?
You know, I'm listening,
like I always do.
NOAM: Well, that offer --
I-I appreciate the offer.
You know -- you know,
we would love you
to be together
with someone,
because we want you to be
in our commercials saying,
"I forbid you
to use paper towels!"
[laughter]
I think if you did that...
GREINER:
They had a plan.
We would love to have you.
Make it part of the deal.
Oh, my goodness.
That's good.
Let's see if any other sharks
are interested.
Robert, what are you doing?
Just listening.
