Hi. I'm Dr. Amy Baxter
from Atlanta, Georgia,
BAXTER: Buzzy is
an award-winning medical device
Amy,
how does it work?
So, if you're getting
a shot here...
Right.
...So, you put it on
Amy,
even more than patents,
what's important to me
is sales.
Do you have sales
of this product today?
We launched in 2009,
Amy, was it cheaper when
you were making it in China?
You know,
it was initially,
but the prices in China
have risen so much.
My last negotiated piece price
at my U.S. facility
is exactly what my last
quoted price from China was.
That's good to hear.
Yeah, good for you.
O'LEARY:
You're asking me to pay you
27 times
next year's pre-tax earnings.
You see anything wrong
with that?
So, if you think about investing
in a consumer medical device,
say, for example,
an Ava the Elephant,
that might be something that
helps children take medicine --
Barbara invested $55,000,
HERJAVEC: Amy, why do you need
the $500,000?
I need the $500,000
to scale,
because if I am in
even one big-box chain,
they're gonna need
24,000 of them,
Amy, Kevin is right.
His offer
is the right valuation
for where you are today.
For you to get to that next
step, it's executional.
He offered you $500,000
for 20%.
If he'll have me,
I'd be happy to go in
on that offer.
O'LEARY:
I'm happy with that.
I'll take his $250,000,
put it with mine,
but I'm not changing
the valuation.
You're not worth more
than 3 million bucks right now.
You're just not.
So, $250,000 from him,
$250,000 from me
for 20% of the business.
What do you think?
I think no.
I think that the valuation
of $5 million,
while we
may not be there today,
in two weeks,
I may have another contract
that brings my sales up.
Mark, are you in,
or are you out?
Look, you might very well
be able to get
to your $5 million, $10 million,
$20 million valuation.
The question is,
how long is this gonna take?
Now, you may think,
"I could just hire a C.O.O."
That is not
as easy as it sounds.
You've got
an enormous level
HERJAVEC: Amy, regardless
of what his offer is,
I think three people have given
you the same valuation.
How do you address that?
I-I still want to push back
on valuation.
There are multiple
medical-device companies
Thank you.
Good luck, Amy.
Thank you.
I can say this --
Mark,
if you had gotten that deal,
she would have
made you crazy.
