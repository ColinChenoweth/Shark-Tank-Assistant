Hi, sharks.
I'm Hayley Carr.
Our company
is Zipit Bedding,
and today we're seeking
an investment of $75,000
for a 20% stake
in our business.
3 billion children
live on this Earth,
and none of them seem to know
how to make a bed,
much less want to.
HERJAVEC: [chuckles]
And, frankly,
aren't you tired of seeing
your kids' beds look like this?
Well...
We were.
We were.
So, we invented the next
must-have bedding solution
for parents and kids
that's gonna revolutionize
the bedding industry.
Introducing...
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
Zipit Bedding!
Zipit Bedding!
The world's first hybrid
of a sleeping bag
and a conventional
bedding set.
Let's show you
how it works.
All right, sharks, this is
our family friend Ava,
and she's 6 years old.
Hi, Ava.
Hi, Ava.
She just lost
a tooth.
Okay.
So, it's simple.
[chuckles]
You just...
...Zip the zipper
like that.
That connects the top comforter
to the fitted sheet,
so now
it's all one piece.
Your kids can't kick off
their covers.
When it's time
to wash your bedding,
you simply lift off the fitted
sheet part right here.
HERJAVEC: Oh.
Wash it in the washer as one,
and remake it as one.
The kids are loving
the zippered side pockets,
'cause you can store things
like baseball cards,
game controllers,
flashlights.
But my favorite part is that
if your child can zip a zipper,
he or she can now
make their own bed.
And it's fun, like a sleeping
bag, so they'll want to.
So, Ava, hop on out.
Good job. Ready?
She just zips it closed.
And voilà.
The bed's made.
Here. Up top.
You did great.
Okay. You're done.
Nice hops.
CORCORAN:
Nicely done.
Good job, Ava.
Yay.
So, stop making beds
the old way.
Yes.
With Zipit Bedding,
it's now fun, fast, and easy.
You just zip it.
You just zip it.
That was
our golf swing.
Does it unzip
all the way around?
Can I --
I want to go look.
MACDONALD:
Yeah. Come on up.
CARR:
Please, come on.
I mean, I'm just curious,
because...
It unzips on both sides
so you can detach the top.
CARR: So...the zipper
stops at the end.
So -- Oh,
it goes all the way.
MACDONALD:
All the way down.
And it's actually
open at the foot.
Yeah,
this part's open.
And this isn't
our only version.
We actually have
two other versions
based on comments from moms
that love this product,
but they also said,
"Do you have any for a
hard-to-make bunk bed?"
So, we have this giant,
bulky piece right here
that would fit
underneath here.
So, you got the railing.
Why don't you get out the
bunk-bed version, as well?
MACDONALD: Yeah, that's
what I'm gonna do.
You don't want to have to jam
the comforter side into there.
It looks messy. Our --
our goal with this is
to always look neat.
And this is our
glow-in-the-dark version.
CUBAN:
I got to say, like,
I would sleep with my brother
when I was little.
This would have been perfect
for Dutch ovens.
Oh.
[laughs]
I would have had him locked in
with no way to escape.
Thank you.
GREINER: I'm gonna ask you
the natural question for me.
Oh, sure.
Ask us.
Is it patented?
It's patent pending.
Do you have any sales?
We do.
We've sold 1,000.
We did -- we wanted to test
the market, so we printed 1,000.
We sold out of them.
And where'd
you sell them?
We sold them
mostly online.
How did people online
find you?
Actually, we just used
social media, word of mouth.
We did a commercial.
We put together
about a three-minute commercial.
Very D.R.-Style,
black and white to color.
DRTV -- that's Direct-Response
Television Spot.
Right. Yes.
Let's stay on the numbers.
You did 1,000 units.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
What was your gross sales?
What was your net?
Uh...
Made $7,500 gross.
And then we had expenses,
so we actually took a loss.
But it was just to test
the market.
CUBAN:
What did you sell them for?
Um, we sold these
for $59.99 twin.
Okay.
And $69.99 full.
So, what's your cost
to make one?
We've now gotten it down to $24
and this is $20.
That's the best that your,
uh, quote was?
You know --
We're working
with a production designer...
If you --
if I may -- sorry.
Yeah, go ahead.
...Who has 20-plus years
in the kids-bedding industry.
He loves this product.
He's actually hooking us up
with this bedding distributor,
one of the biggest, and they
have interest in it right
now. but we want a shark.
What do they want
for that interest?
MACDONALD:
Yeah. Um...
We were licensing the
functionality to them, so...
What was
their offer?
O'LEARY: Yeah.
They were giving us 50,000
minimum for the -- for quantity.
They're gonna
buy that many?
MACDONALD: Yeah.
And then it was gonna be 4% for
national and 6% international.
Have they
given you a contract?
We had a term sheet
that we got there, too,
and then
we actually jumped out.
Why?
That's everyone's
dream.
We went to New York, and we
flew, and we met with them,
and -- and they wanted to pay
for our entire D.R. campaign,
so we were really honored,
and we worked with them,
and we brought in a
broker to handle the
final contractual phase.
When it came to do a contract,
and we said, "Listen,
"y-you're trying to put this on
the shelves in summer of 2014.
We think it needs to be here
for Christmas."
This was five months ago.
That license deal
is very close
to a very interesting
opportunity.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
And I think you could get it up
from 4% to 6%.
It is -- it's --
Remember, they were gonna invest
money into our D.R. campaign.
75 million
kids in America alone.
So, it wasn't just the 4%.
They were then --
You guys, a D.R. campaign,
I have to say -- big red flag.
You know,
9 out of 10 fail.
And, personally, to me,
this is not a DRTV campaign.
Yes.
Did you
like those people?
We just feel like they didn't
have the passion behind it
that we're, you know,
prepared to bring.
So, it was like leaving a kid
in the wrong babysitter's hands.
HERJAVEC: But, Hayley, they've
got all the distribution.
They've got
all the stores.
Yes.
They're gonna get you out
in the market.
They're taking
all the risk up front.
We're actually --
the thing is,
again, we really feel
with this product
that it should have been
on the shelves yesterday.
but it's not.
We're --
But we're so concerned
about being first to market.
They're gonna get you to market
faster than you are.
They've been doing this.
You cannot start
from zero
and create the market
faster than they can.
We felt like
we lost some control.
We feel that we can.
And, to be honest, this is
a long-term product to us.
We're trying to revolutionize
the bedding -- bedding industry.
O'LEARY: You're very passionate
about the product.
It's very clear.
And you may have something.
I'm a license guy.
I love licensing.
I'm the king of licensing.
I could have helped you there.
I think this could have gone
all the way to 7%,
which is about the maximum
you can do on a license.
Okay.
But I know you don't
want to go there.
You've said that three times
already.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll tell you,
it's very, very interesting,
because one of
the biggest obstacles
that people
come to "Shark Tank" have
with a product like this
is distribution.
Yes.
You came here
with somebody
that was willing to take that
risk and get you to the market.
I think --
But we also want guidance, too,
and that's why we're here.
We're -- we're ready
to bring on an ace in our team.
But I think
you can negotiate the deal.
I don't think you guys
really want the guidance.
You have a plan in mind.
No, we absolutely do.
That potential --
You know, Hayley,
I think Mark's right.
I think you have a very clear
way that you want to do this,
so I'm not sure
I share that same path.
Okay.
I'm out.
Okay.
I think you have
a couple of huge obstacles.
Okay.
This idea of an infomercial,
anything like that --
forget about it.
it's just not affordable.
right.
Also, you didn't like
the licensing deal
because you fell in love
with your product.
It's like falling madly in love
with your kid.
You're not trusting anybody
with it.
But there's a franticness
to your love
that makes me feel like
you have no idea
what path you should be taking.
Our clear path is to
create brand awareness
on a national level...
How are you going to do that?
It's all in-house.
...With our catchy commercial
and a jingle.
How are you gonna
pay for the commercial?
We're gonna pay for it with
the funds that we get today.
But without
a clear business plan,
I think you're gonna have
a heck of a time
getting anybody to buy in.
I'm out.
Thank you. Okay.
We're just -- we really think
the product speaks for itself.
Ye-- yes, we do
bring passion to it, but --
CUBAN: Guys, guys.
You're the type of entrepreneur
that says, "I'm open-minded.
"I'm gonna listen
to all your ideas,
and I'm gonna tell you
what they are."
Yes.
You know.
You're not open-minded.
You're -- you're really not.
What do you think
it's gonna be like
for us
to try to work together?
For that reason, I'm out.
Okay,
we have one shark left.
CARR:
What about snuggie?
There's a different formula.
Same with snuggie,
you guys.
Sure.
That's a different formula.
It's a different product.
Hayley, you need to be
in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
But -- yes.
You need to be
in a traditional retailer.
We agree, yes.
We think
it's both, though.
Um...
We don't -- we don't see
why we can't do both.
You guys, four times I explained
to you that a DRTV spot,
in my opinion,
is the wrong way to go.
Yes. yeah.
And no matter what,
you kept saying back to me,
"We want to do both."
Sure.
We d-- we definitely
believe in that, so we'll --
we'll take your advice,
but I think, you know,
that is the route
that we want to go.
[laughter]
So, you know what?
If that's the way
that you want to go, I'm out.
CUBAN: Good luck, guys.
Go get 'em.
I'll look for the commercial
on TV.
CARR: Thank you.
I'm still sticking
to that D.R. campaign.
Yeah, I agree.
We're gonna get
our commercial on TV.
Okay.
[chuckles]
Those are two partners that
are exactly like each other.
Yes, they are.
Oh, my God.
They're sisters.
So, one gets off
on a tangent.
The other one...
It was like a couple
of zebra finches in a cage.
What?!
CUBAN: Next.
A zebra finch?
Yeah.
It was just...
NARRATOR:
Next up is a couple
with an eco-friendly way
to clean up.
Hi, sharks.
