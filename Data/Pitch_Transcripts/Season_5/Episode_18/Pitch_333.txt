Hi. I'm Dr. Amy Baxter
from Atlanta, Georgia,
and I'm the creator of Buzzy.
I'm asking for $500,000
in exchange for 5%
of my company.
Wow.
As a pediatrician, I was ready
to rock my son's shots.
I had numbing cream on
an hour in advance,
but when the needle-wielding
fiend came in,
she said, "You better sit there
and be still,
or this is really gonna hurt."
And it did.
And after that,
like 63% of children today,
he developed needle phobia,
a problem that can last
a lifetime.
Driving home from
an overnight emergency shift,
my steering wheel was vibrating
because my tires
were unbalanced,
and my hands got numb.
I burst into my house going,
"Vibration!
That's the answer!"
And with a buzzing
personal massager
on some frozen peas
on my kids' arms...
GREINER: [laughs]
...I could leave marks
on their hands,
and they felt nothing.
Hmm.
So, that's how Buzzy was born.
Can we try Buzzy out?
CORCORAN: Yeah. [chuckles]
BAXTER: Buzzy is
an award-winning medical device
that combines
cold and vibration.
Thank you.
Putting the two together,
you can instantly numb
needle pain,
and it's been proven
in multiple clinical trials.
Thank you.
[buzzes]
Amy,
how does it work?
So, if you're getting
a shot here...
Right.
...So, you put it on
and numb it
for 15, 30 seconds.
So why not -- why not --
And I will not feel
the needle?
Can't guarantee that.
As a matter of fact,
what I can tell you
is that it decreases pain
between 50% and 80%.
We're in about 1,200
hospitals and clinics now.
We actually have
two issued patents,
four applications
that are filed,
two international patents
that are in progress.
Amy,
even more than patents,
what's important to me
is sales.
Do you have sales
of this product today?
We launched in 2009,
and this year we are on target
for $1 million in sales.
Next year,
we project $2.5 million.
Wow.
We've sold $33,000 Buzzys.
How many
in the last 12 months?
13,000.
Are the reps
showing these around, then?
Like, when they go
to doctors' offices?
We -- we don't have any reps.
You're not even trying
to sell them?
Well, obviously,
I'm trying to,
but I'm --
I'm a full-time doctor.
I know it sounds weird.
Nobody is selling these.
People are coming to us.
You have employees?
I have 6 moms who work for me
between 20 and 30 hours a week.
On the $1 million
that you'll sell this year,
what will you make?
So, $660,000
is our gross profit,
and $270,000
is gonna be our net profit.
Our average margin is 70%.
Wow.
Your margin's huge.
The lowest-cost Buzzy
is $39.95 for the home version.
Where do you make it?
I started in China, 'cause
everyone said start in China,
and the first batch was great,
and then the next batch
was awful,
and I spent so much time
messing with them
that I said,
"Just send me my tool back."
Amy, was it cheaper when
you were making it in China?
You know,
it was initially,
but the prices in China
have risen so much.
My last negotiated piece price
at my U.S. facility
is exactly what my last
quoted price from China was.
That's good to hear.
Yeah, good for you.
O'LEARY:
You're asking me to pay you
27 times
next year's pre-tax earnings.
You see anything wrong
with that?
So, if you think about investing
in a consumer medical device,
say, for example,
an Ava the Elephant,
that might be something that
helps children take medicine --
Barbara invested $55,000,
and now there's $100,000
in sales.
I invested $55,000,
but by the time we brought it
to market,
I had invested $285,000.
It's a very, very
difficult space.
That's why I'm here, because
you've already done that work.
So, I bet you've got solutions
that are much less expensive
for you to work with.
I'm gonna
tell you something.
Sadly,
I've had the experience
of climbing a mountain
and spending much more money
than I envisioned --
and I imagine this product
is gonna be the same
to bring it
to the medical space,
which is where
it should be.
And so for those
very real concerns, I'm out.
O'LEARY:
I have two issues with it.
Number one is,
it's not clear
what your distribution strategy
is going to be
to make this
a big product.
But the one that's really
killing it for me
and why I got a flyswatter
on Buzzy
is your valuation.
You're asking me to pay
a multiple that's higher than
a large medical-supply company.
That doesn't
make sense to me.
I think what you're worth today
is $3 million.
You're asking for $10 million.
That's a huge delta.
And if I'm just looking
at other opportunities
to deploy
half a million dollars,
why would I overpay
that way?
I wouldn't.
HERJAVEC: Amy, why do you need
the $500,000?
I need the $500,000
to scale,
because if I am in
even one big-box chain,
they're gonna need
24,000 of them,
so I need to order extra
to meet that demand.
I need packaging.
I need a P.R. firm.
That's a canned answer.
No. Do you want to look
at the numbers? I mean --
No, I know what it costs,
but it's a canned answer
in terms of are you expecting
to be in a big-box retailer
for this?
Yes!
Then who's gonna manage
all that?
Well, I'm obviously gonna need
to build up the management team.
Yes.
I can hire a C.O.O.
It's a huge mistake
to go into big-box stores.
Enormous mistake.
Because
you have to educate people
so that they come in
to buy them.
Doctor, you don't have
to reinvent distribution
for a medical device.
You don't get it.
NARRATOR: One shark is out.
The remaining sharks
like the product,
but have an issue
with the valuation.
Doctor,
you don't get it.
CUBAN: That's why
your valuation's wrong,
because you're selling
to the wrong places,
and you fully
don't understand.
GREINER:
It's a clever idea.
I know you feel that this
is more for a personal device
that you would sell
in a drugstore,
but the easier path
of least resistance
would be to go
the doctor/hospital route.
I don't feel that the deal
is the right one for me,
and so I'm out.
Thank you.
HERJAVEC:
Mark, what are you gonna do?
Who else is in?
I'm still in, but I'm not happy
with the valuation.
I'll tell you
what I'm looking at.
I would do this deal
for $500,000 for 20%.
HERJAVEC:
Kevin, is that an offer?
Yes.
My offer is $500,000
for 20%.
I've already had people
offer me $500,000.
They're not me.
[chuckles]
Amy, Kevin is right.
His offer
is the right valuation
for where you are today.
For you to get to that next
step, it's executional.
He offered you $500,000
for 20%.
If he'll have me,
I'd be happy to go in
on that offer.
O'LEARY:
I'm happy with that.
I'll take his $250,000,
put it with mine,
but I'm not changing
the valuation.
You're not worth more
than 3 million bucks right now.
You're just not.
So, $250,000 from him,
$250,000 from me
for 20% of the business.
What do you think?
I think no.
I think that the valuation
of $5 million,
while we
may not be there today,
in two weeks,
I may have another contract
that brings my sales up.
Mark, are you in,
or are you out?
Look, you might very well
be able to get
to your $5 million, $10 million,
$20 million valuation.
The question is,
how long is this gonna take?
Now, you may think,
"I could just hire a C.O.O."
That is not
as easy as it sounds.
You've got
an enormous level
of execution risk
and timing risk
that I think you're not
taking into consideration.
I'm of the mind-set of the 500k,
just myself,
for 20%.
The same offer.
Different approach,
'cause I think
it's more about
getting to moms.
HERJAVEC: Amy, regardless
of what his offer is,
I think three people have given
you the same valuation.
How do you address that?
I-I still want to push back
on valuation.
There are multiple
medical-device companies
that come from where I am
and scale quickly.
I see the opportunity.
What I don't see is
the infrastructure
and company to do it.
You're nuts
not to weigh in
the expertise
that comes with those offers.
Just think about it,
because I fear
your arrogance
is gonna make you
walk out the door
because you think
you can do it yourself.
I am so grateful
for the offers
and for the consideration
and the time...
...But I am gonna stick
to my valuation.
I can't watch.
I'm gonna --
I'm sorry, but I am.
O'LEARY: Okay, well, then,
I've made a decision.
You're dead to me.
Get out of here.
Thank you.
Good luck, Amy.
Thank you.
I can say this --
Mark,
if you had gotten that deal,
she would have
made you crazy.
