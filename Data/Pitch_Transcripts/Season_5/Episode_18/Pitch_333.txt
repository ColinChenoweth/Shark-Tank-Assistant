Hi, sharks.
I'm Hayley Carr.
Our company
is Zipit Bedding,
CARR:
Please, come on.
I mean, I'm just curious,
because...
It unzips on both sides
so you can detach the top.
CARR: So...the zipper
stops at the end.
So -- Oh,
it goes all the way.
HERJAVEC: But, Hayley, they've
got all the distribution.
They've got
all the stores.
Yes.
They're gonna get you out
in the market.
They're taking
all the risk up front.
We're actually --
the thing is,
again, we really feel
with this product
that it should have been
on the shelves yesterday.
but it's not.
We're --
But we're so concerned
about being first to market.
They're gonna get you to market
faster than you are.
They've been doing this.
You cannot start
from zero
You know, Hayley,
I think Mark's right.
I think you have a very clear
way that you want to do this,
so I'm not sure
I share that same path.
Okay.
I'm out.
Okay.
I think you have
a couple of huge obstacles.
Okay.
This idea of an infomercial,
anything like that --
forget about it.
it's just not affordable.
right.
Also, you didn't like
the licensing deal
because you fell in love
with your product.
It's like falling madly in love
with your kid.
You're not trusting anybody
with it.
But there's a franticness
to your love
that makes me feel like
you have no idea
what path you should be taking.
CARR:
What about snuggie?
There's a different formula.
Same with snuggie,
you guys.
Sure.
That's a different formula.
It's a different product.
Hayley, you need to be
in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
But -- yes.
You need to be
in a traditional retailer.
We agree, yes.
We think
it's both, though.
Um...
We don't -- we don't see
why we can't do both.
You guys, four times I explained
to you that a DRTV spot,
in my opinion,
is the wrong way to go.
Yes. yeah.
CARR: Thank you.
I'm still sticking
to that D.R. campaign.
Yeah, I agree.
We're gonna get
our commercial on TV.
Okay.
[chuckles]
Those are two partners that
are exactly like each other.
Yes, they are.
Oh, my God.
They're sisters.
So, one gets off
on a tangent.
The other one...
It was like a couple
of zebra finches in a cage.
What?!
CUBAN: Next.
A zebra finch?
Yeah.
It was just...
NARRATOR:
Next up is a couple
with an eco-friendly way
to clean up.
Hi, sharks.
