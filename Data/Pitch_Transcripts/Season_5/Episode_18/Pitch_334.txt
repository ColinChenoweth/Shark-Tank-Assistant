CORCORAN: You've got exactly
what you wanted from Lori,
and you're gonna shop
the rest of the sharks?
You're dead to me.
Get out of here.
"You better sit there
and be still, or this
is really gonna hurt."
CUBAN: [laughs]
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
I'm Lori Cheek,
and I live in New York City,
and I'm the founder
and C.E.O. of Cheek'd.
I'm from a very small town
in Kentucky.
And I've always been
a very creative person,
and then when it came time
to make a decision
about what I wanted to be,
I decided architecture
kind of made sense,
until I came up with a passion
that was way bigger.
I've seen the
cutest guys here.
I'm an architect no longer
building structures.
I'm now building relationships.
Mm, he is cute.
Say goodbye to being single
and scrolling online for dates.
Cheek'd is a clever new service
that puts a fun twist on dating.
My concept has been tested
and proven.
After decades on my own
relentless pursuit for love,
I've Cheek'd an attractive man,
and now we're engaged.
Hello, this is Lori
from Cheek'd.
I have given up everything
I have and know
to build this business.
Failure is not an option
for me.
However, I am dangerously close
to it.
The reality is,
I am out of money and resources
to continue building my dream,
so I desperately need
this investment from the sharks.
Hi. I'm Lori Cheek
from New York City.
I'm the founder and C.E.O.
of Cheek'd.
I'm here seeking an investment
of $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Cheek'd is online dating
in reverse.
Initial attraction
happens face-to-face,
while interaction
happens safely online.
I once watched my handsome
friend pick up a girl
by simply scribbling,
"Want to have dinner?"
On the back
of his business card.
He left with a date,
and I left with an idea.
Him handing her
that intriguing note
was the perfect
non-intrusive gesture,
but I didn't like the idea
of all that personal information
on the other side
of that business card.
So, let's say
I spot an intriguing stranger
on my morning commute.
I can simply
slip them a Cheek'd card.
On one side, that card says,
"You've been Cheek'd."
On the other side,
there's an ice-breaking
pickup line such as,
"Act natural.
We can get awkward later," or...
"I'm hitting on you."
[tink!]
[chuckles]
CHEEK: If they're interested
in learning more about me,
they can go
to the Cheek'd website
and type in the unique code
from the card to see my profile.
Neither party hands
any personal information
until you're both
ready to do so.
Whoo.
So, sharks...
[chuckles]
...if you want a piece
of the next generation
of online dating, invest in me,
and now you're all
gonna get Cheek'd.
These are kind of customized
for each of you.
Top one, Lori?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
You're very welcome.
Why, thank you.
[chuckles]
You've been Cheek'd.
GREINER:
Oh, this is cute.
Okeydoke.
HERJAVEC: That's cute.
And for you.
"I'd fill your jewelry box."
HERJAVEC:
"I saw you tech-ing me out."
[laughter]
So, the only customization
on the business card
is that code at the bottom.
The I.D. code varies
with each individual?
CHEEK: They're numbered
like a checkbook.
So, tell me
how that all works.
You go in
and create a simple profile.
Right.
There are
nine simple questions,
and, uh, you order
a deck of cards.
So you can order
a 50-card deck,
or you can customize
your own deck.
Do I pay for them?
Yes.
How much?
They're -- the cards are $20.
After your initial purchase
of $20 for the cards,
you -- you pay $9.95
to keep that code
activated to your profile.
$9.95 a month?
Yes.
Do I have to sign up
for a year?
And you can opt out
at any point.
Any point.
Yes.
Aren't most people
using online dating
'cause they're too shy
or uncomfortable about
approaching people?
I mean, if I have the
courage to go up to you
and give you a card,
don't I have the courage
to go up and talk to you?
These are all very good
questions, but imagine I'm in --
No. I'll tell -- I'll answer --
I'll answer that, right?
The answer is, "No."
Way back, um,
my single days --
my friends and I
used to throw parties.
And -- no lie -- we would get
business cards printed up
and it'd have the date,
location, the time,
and it was like an invite
to a party,
but the point was, it was easier
to talk to girls because --
See? but you still
got to go up to them
and talk to them.
but you don't talk, right?
You just say, "Hey," and
this way, you know you're
gonna see them at the party.
Although it's --
So, some weirdo comes up to you
and gives you a card --
You don't
have to use it.
No, but it's easier
because you're inviting them
to a party.
You're not going up and saying,
"Parents love me."
Well, yeah, or you're --
and you just walk away.
Which means I'm specifically
interested in you.
Oh, Lori, who cares
what we think?
Trust me --
What we give them --
Do you have people
that are online today?
What are your sales?
Yeah, how many subscribers
do you have?
Is this
an existing business?
These are all very good
questions. [chuckles]
O'LEARY: Are you gonna
answer them?
Absolutely.
It's very exciting.
So, how many
subscribers?
So, I launched my business
in may of 2010.
So far, I've reached customers
in 47 states in America
and 28 countries
internationally.
How many in total?
How many warm bodies?
4,500 active members.
So, these people actually
have profiles on the site, so...
Have they paid something?
No.
I have had 1,125 people
pay Cheek'd something.
So, Lori,
over the last three years...
So, let me ask
the question another way.
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
How are you living?
This is a very --
also a very good question. So...
[laughter]
I love how affirmative you are
with our questions.
Okay, so, I have made $56,000
in 3 1/2 years.
And you're still living
in New York City?
I worked as an architect for
Christian Dior for four years.
In the time I was there,
I had a pretty amazing wardrobe.
When I came up with this idea
five years ago,
I decided,
"This is such a great idea,
I've got to make it happen."
I moved out
of my West Village studio,
and I sold my entire
Christian Dior wardrobe on --
Wow.
Where are you living?
Sofas of all my friends.
How much money have you
put into it?
$120,000 of my own money.
Wow.
Three years have gone by.
Cheek'd is making no money
at all.
You know, my definition
of a hobby
is something that never
makes money after three years.
[chuckles]
You've lost your apartment.
You're starving.
You're not making any money.
And what else can you sell?
I've had a lot
of technology problems.
I'm here
asking for your help.
The reason it's not working
is because my website
has been broken
with the subscription model
since day one.
And to this day...
So, and you keep on going,
and you keep on spending money.
You're not doing yourself
any favors.
I just got it fixed.
After burning $120,000, you --
you fixed it 3 years later?
I'm gonna figure this out.
I will take this business
until it is a household name,
and this is gonna change
the population.
I mean that.
People will -- people need this.
Okay, I have a rule.
When people come in
that are delusional,
I have to say, "I'm out."
I'm out.
Maybe I was overambitious
by saying I'm gonna change
the population...
You think?
...But I do think that people
want to meet in the real world.
I'm here
with a working website.
I'm here with a mobile-phone app
that's ready to launch,
where you'll be able
to search who's nearby.
But, Lori, it's the same
business model.
Right.
After three years -- you know,
the definition of "insanity"
is doing the same thing,
expecting a different result.
Lori, I-I want to tell you
a story
that's very appropriate
for you.
It's gonna help you
immensely,
and you're gonna thank me
for it, okay?
It's a story
about a boy and his dog.
[laughs]
One day, the dog
went out into the forest
And got bitten by a raccoon
that had rabies.
And the dog
slowly went insane.
The father made the boy
take the dog behind the barn
and made the son
shoot the dog.
Your deal
is the rabid dog.
It's a very bad idea,
and I really want to shoot it.
If you won't let me,
I have to say I'm out.
I think you've missed the entire
point of online dating.
People like online dating
because of the anonymity
and because
they're really busy.
I just think that the entire
premise is flawed.
If I have the courage to go up
to a woman like you
and hand you the card, I have
the courage to ask you out.
I think it's
a flawed business premise.
I'm out.
It's a cute idea, but it hasn't
been working for you, and --
It hasn't been working because
my website's been broken.
My website is fixed.
You know, I just read on your
Facebook wall the other day,
"The biggest mistake
anyone can make
is to be afraid
to make mistakes."
I've made every mistake
I can possibly make,
and I will take this
to the next level...
It's --
...with a small financial boost.
I will.
You can't let fear stop you
from moving forward,
but I think, here,
sometimes you have to see
that something isn't working
and really open your eyes wide
and look at that and say,
"Maybe I need
to do something different."
For whatever reason,
it's not really working for you,
and I don't think
it was just the website.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Barbara, I know you invest
in people.
You know, uh, I can't fault you
for your obvious passion.
When I started
a flower business,
for two years,
I killed myself.
I totally believed in
a "Flower of the Week" club.
No one had it. I loved flowers.
I loved my customers.
I killed myself.
I worked 24 hours a day.
But you want to know
what I wasn't doing?
Listening to the universe
that was telling me
it wasn't working.
You got to move on,
because it's stopping you
from going to what
you're supposed to be.
That stupid flower business,
if I had hung on to it,
would have never let me
be a millionaire.
You're the right entrepreneur,
but this is the wrong business.
You got to move on.
That's a great story.
And that's exactly
what I was saying.
I say it better.
Just shoot it.
[chuckles]
You in, or you out,
Barbara?
I forgot to say, "I'm out."
painfully, I'm out.
Thank you all very much.
Good luck, Lori.
Wow.
She's not gonna give up.
That's the sad part.
I'm gonna change the world.
I'm not quitting this idea.
I believe in this
more than anything,
and I'm not gonna stop until
this becomes a household name.
NARRATOR:
Next up are two sisters
who came up
with an easier way
to accomplish
a dreaded childhood chore.
Aww.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Jennifer MacDonald,
and this is my sister
and business partner.
Lori.
My belief is that you focused
on the wrong angle.
I think that you
should try
to get your costs
as low as possible.
Okay.
Sure.
I think that you should try
to get it into retailers.
I don't think DRTV
and an expensive TV campaign
is the way to go.
We're willing to do that,
as well.
We're doing --
We would like to do both.
We would like
to do both.
I hope when you walk away
from here
that you will erase that
from your mind.
Sure.
Okay.
Because that will be
a waste of money.
Yep.
Was it a waste
for pillow pets?
CUBAN: Yeah,
but you're not them.
I -- you guys
aren't pillow pets.
You're not them.
You're not them.
It's a different product.
MACDONALD:
Or the snuggie.
It's a completely
different product.
CORCORAN:
Lori, I want to ask you.
Can this be sold on QVC
like crazy or not?
I feel
it has to be demonstrated.
I think it's a great
demonstrable item.
And I will tell you, Barb,
I love the two of them.
I think you guys are heroes.
I think the product's a hero.
And I love
that you came in saying,
"Because our mission
is so important to us
"about planting trees
and saving our world,
"that we're willing to give
you sharks
a portion
of our entire business."
So, I'm willing to make you
an offer.
I'm going to give you
the $200,000 at 10%.
Because I think
what you're doing is fair,
and I admire it,
and I'd like to be a part of it.
Say yes while you can.
Wow.
[chuckles]
Is there --
Lori, our answer is --
Well...
What's your response?
I know that the rest of you
have not had an opportunity
to give an offer.
Would you like
to -- to pitch in?
CORCORAN: Wait. You got exactly
what you wanted from Lori,
and you're gonna shop
the rest of the sharks?
I offered you guys
exactly what you asked for
because I believe in
your mission statement.
Our answer is yes.
Good going.
Whoo-hoo!
We're gonna plant
some trees.
Whoo-hoo!
Nice meeting you.
Let's save some trees.
Good job, Lori.
Thanks.
Bye.
It's a good thing.
Good guy.
Wow.
Yahoo!
[laughs]
Yes!
IRENE: Lori was
the best shark for us,
and we're really excited.
It's gonna be the biggest
product in "Shark Tank" history!
NARRATOR:
In Season Three, best friends
Dallas Robinson and Mike Buonomo
pitched
their flavor-changing lip balm,
Kisstixx, to the sharks.
[laughter]
That's so disgusting.
I'm willing to give you
the $200,000
for 40%.
ROBINSON: We would love
to accept your offer.
We'd love to work
with you.
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.
A lot has changed
since our last update.
My founding partner, Mike,
recently got
a great job opportunity
and left the company.
We still meet,
but I handle all the day-to-day.
See what it looks like.
Looks pretty sweet,
doesn't it?
Mark recently bought us
the website domain "How to Kiss"
and told us to use it
as a branding tool,
where our demographic
will come and find
tips, tricks, techniques
all about kissing.
It's already being searched
on the internet,
and this will be one place
for them to get
all that information.
We're here in Nashville working
with artist Danielle Peck.
She has a song called
"Kiss Me Like You Miss Me"
that is perfect
for our site and our brand.
? Every time our lips meet ?
? Kiss me like you miss me ?
ROBINSON:
Danielle's agreed to become
an official contributor
on our site.
[camera shutter clicks]
That's great.
"Shark Tank" has made
a huge impact on my company.
We recently locked in
our biggest distribution deal
with Kroger,
and now we have
almost $2 million in sales.
"Shark Tank" is the real deal.
[smooches]
Ahh!
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank is a doctor
with a product to ease the sting
out of the dreaded shot.
