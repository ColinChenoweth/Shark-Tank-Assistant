CORCORAN: You've got exactly
what you wanted from Lori,
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
I'm Lori Cheek,
and I live in New York City,
and I'm the founder
and C.E.O. of Cheek'd.
I'm from a very small town
in Kentucky.
Cheek'd is a clever new service
that puts a fun twist on dating.
I've Cheek'd an attractive man,
and now we're engaged.
Hello, this is Lori
from Cheek'd.
Hi. I'm Lori Cheek
from New York City.
I'm the founder and C.E.O.
of Cheek'd.
I'm here seeking an investment
of $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Cheek'd is online dating
in reverse.
Initial attraction
happens face-to-face,
while interaction
happens safely online.
I can simply
slip them a Cheek'd card.
On one side, that card says,
"You've been Cheek'd."
On the other side,
there's an ice-breaking
pickup line such as,
"Act natural.
We can get awkward later," or...
"I'm hitting on you."
[tink!]
[chuckles]
CHEEK: If they're interested
in learning more about me,
they can go
to the Cheek'd website
and now you're all
gonna get Cheek'd.
These are kind of customized
for each of you.
Top one, Lori?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
You're very welcome.
Why, thank you.
[chuckles]
You've been Cheek'd.
GREINER:
Oh, this is cute.
Okeydoke.
CHEEK: They're numbered
like a checkbook.
So, tell me
how that all works.
Oh, Lori, who cares
what we think?
Trust me --
What we give them --
Do you have people
that are online today?
What are your sales?
Yeah, how many subscribers
do you have?
Is this
an existing business?
These are all very good
questions. [chuckles]
O'LEARY: Are you gonna
answer them?
Absolutely.
It's very exciting.
So, how many
subscribers?
So, I launched my business
in may of 2010.
So far, I've reached customers
in 47 states in America
I have had 1,125 people
pay Cheek'd something.
So, Lori,
over the last three years...
So, let me ask
the question another way.
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
How are you living?
This is a very --
also a very good question. So...
[laughter]
I love how affirmative you are
with our questions.
Okay, so, I have made $56,000
in 3 1/2 years.
Cheek'd is making no money
at all.
You know, my definition
of a hobby
is something that never
makes money after three years.
[chuckles]
You've lost your apartment.
You're starving.
But, Lori, it's the same
business model.
Right.
After three years -- you know,
the definition of "insanity"
is doing the same thing,
expecting a different result.
Lori, I-I want to tell you
a story
that's very appropriate
for you.
It's gonna help you
immensely,
Good luck, Lori.
Wow.
She's not gonna give up.
That's the sad part.
I'm gonna change the world.
I'm not quitting this idea.
I believe in this
more than anything,
Lori.
My belief is that you focused
on the wrong angle.
I think that you
should try
to get your costs
as low as possible.
Okay.
Sure.
I think that you should try
to get it into retailers.
CORCORAN:
Lori, I want to ask you.
Can this be sold on QVC
like crazy or not?
I feel
it has to be demonstrated.
I think it's a great
demonstrable item.
Is there --
Lori, our answer is --
Well...
What's your response?
I know that the rest of you
have not had an opportunity
to give an offer.
Would you like
to -- to pitch in?
CORCORAN: Wait. You got exactly
what you wanted from Lori,
Good job, Lori.
Thanks.
Bye.
It's a good thing.
Good guy.
Wow.
Yahoo!
[laughs]
Yes!
IRENE: Lori was
the best shark for us,
