I'm Lori Cheek,
and I live in New York City,
and I'm the founder
and C.E.O. of Cheek'd.
I'm from a very small town
in Kentucky.
And I've always been
a very creative person,
and then when it came time
to make a decision
about what I wanted to be,
I decided architecture
kind of made sense,
until I came up with a passion
that was way bigger.
I've seen the
cutest guys here.
I'm an architect no longer
building structures.
I'm now building relationships.
Mm, he is cute.
Say goodbye to being single
and scrolling online for dates.
Cheek'd is a clever new service
that puts a fun twist on dating.
My concept has been tested
and proven.
After decades on my own
relentless pursuit for love,
I've Cheek'd an attractive man,
and now we're engaged.
Hello, this is Lori
from Cheek'd.
I have given up everything
I have and know
to build this business.
Failure is not an option
for me.
However, I am dangerously close
to it.
The reality is,
I am out of money and resources
to continue building my dream,
so I desperately need
this investment from the sharks.
Hi. I'm Lori Cheek
from New York City.
I'm the founder and C.E.O.
of Cheek'd.
I'm here seeking an investment
of $100,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company.
Cheek'd is online dating
in reverse.
Initial attraction
happens face-to-face,
while interaction
happens safely online.
I once watched my handsome
friend pick up a girl
by simply scribbling,
"Want to have dinner?"
On the back
of his business card.
He left with a date,
and I left with an idea.
Him handing her
that intriguing note
was the perfect
non-intrusive gesture,
but I didn't like the idea
of all that personal information
on the other side
of that business card.
So, let's say
I spot an intriguing stranger
on my morning commute.
I can simply
slip them a Cheek'd card.
On one side, that card says,
"You've been Cheek'd."
On the other side,
there's an ice-breaking
pickup line such as,
"Act natural.
We can get awkward later," or...
"I'm hitting on you."
[tink!]
[chuckles]
CHEEK: If they're interested
in learning more about me,
they can go
to the Cheek'd website
and type in the unique code
from the card to see my profile.
Neither party hands
any personal information
until you're both
ready to do so.
Whoo.
So, sharks...
[chuckles]
...if you want a piece
of the next generation
of online dating, invest in me,
and now you're all
gonna get Cheek'd.
These are kind of customized
for each of you.
Top one, Lori?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
You're very welcome.
Why, thank you.
[chuckles]
You've been Cheek'd.
GREINER:
Oh, this is cute.
Okeydoke.
HERJAVEC: That's cute.
And for you.
"I'd fill your jewelry box."
HERJAVEC:
"I saw you tech-ing me out."
[laughter]
So, the only customization
on the business card
is that code at the bottom.
The I.D. code varies
with each individual?
CHEEK: They're numbered
like a checkbook.
So, tell me
how that all works.
You go in
and create a simple profile.
Right.
There are
nine simple questions,
and, uh, you order
a deck of cards.
So you can order
a 50-card deck,
or you can customize
your own deck.
Do I pay for them?
Yes.
How much?
They're -- the cards are $20.
After your initial purchase
of $20 for the cards,
you -- you pay $9.95
to keep that code
activated to your profile.
$9.95 a month?
Yes.
Do I have to sign up
for a year?
And you can opt out
at any point.
Any point.
Yes.
Aren't most people
using online dating
'cause they're too shy
or uncomfortable about
approaching people?
I mean, if I have the
courage to go up to you
and give you a card,
don't I have the courage
to go up and talk to you?
These are all very good
questions, but imagine I'm in --
No. I'll tell -- I'll answer --
I'll answer that, right?
The answer is, "No."
Way back, um,
my single days --
my friends and I
used to throw parties.
And -- no lie -- we would get
business cards printed up
and it'd have the date,
location, the time,
and it was like an invite
to a party,
but the point was, it was easier
to talk to girls because --
See? but you still
got to go up to them
and talk to them.
but you don't talk, right?
You just say, "Hey," and
this way, you know you're
gonna see them at the party.
Although it's --
So, some weirdo comes up to you
and gives you a card --
You don't
have to use it.
No, but it's easier
because you're inviting them
to a party.
You're not going up and saying,
"Parents love me."
Well, yeah, or you're --
and you just walk away.
Which means I'm specifically
interested in you.
Oh, Lori, who cares
what we think?
Trust me --
What we give them --
Do you have people
that are online today?
What are your sales?
Yeah, how many subscribers
do you have?
Is this
an existing business?
These are all very good
questions. [chuckles]
O'LEARY: Are you gonna
answer them?
Absolutely.
It's very exciting.
So, how many
subscribers?
So, I launched my business
in may of 2010.
So far, I've reached customers
in 47 states in America
and 28 countries
internationally.
How many in total?
How many warm bodies?
4,500 active members.
So, these people actually
have profiles on the site, so...
Have they paid something?
No.
I have had 1,125 people
pay Cheek'd something.
So, Lori,
over the last three years...
So, let me ask
the question another way.
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
How are you living?
This is a very --
also a very good question. So...
[laughter]
I love how affirmative you are
with our questions.
Okay, so, I have made $56,000
in 3 1/2 years.
And you're still living
in New York City?
I worked as an architect for
Christian Dior for four years.
In the time I was there,
I had a pretty amazing wardrobe.
When I came up with this idea
five years ago,
I decided,
"This is such a great idea,
I've got to make it happen."
I moved out
of my West Village studio,
and I sold my entire
Christian Dior wardrobe on --
Wow.
Where are you living?
Sofas of all my friends.
How much money have you
put into it?
$120,000 of my own money.
Wow.
Three years have gone by.
Cheek'd is making no money
at all.
You know, my definition
of a hobby
is something that never
makes money after three years.
[chuckles]
You've lost your apartment.
You're starving.
You're not making any money.
And what else can you sell?
I've had a lot
of technology problems.
I'm here
asking for your help.
The reason it's not working
is because my website
has been broken
with the subscription model
since day one.
And to this day...
So, and you keep on going,
and you keep on spending money.
You're not doing yourself
any favors.
I just got it fixed.
After burning $120,000, you --
you fixed it 3 years later?
I'm gonna figure this out.
I will take this business
until it is a household name,
and this is gonna change
the population.
I mean that.
People will -- people need this.
Okay, I have a rule.
When people come in
that are delusional,
I have to say, "I'm out."
I'm out.
Maybe I was overambitious
by saying I'm gonna change
the population...
You think?
...But I do think that people
want to meet in the real world.
I'm here
with a working website.
I'm here with a mobile-phone app
that's ready to launch,
where you'll be able
to search who's nearby.
But, Lori, it's the same
business model.
Right.
After three years -- you know,
the definition of "insanity"
is doing the same thing,
expecting a different result.
Lori, I-I want to tell you
a story
that's very appropriate
for you.
It's gonna help you
immensely,
and you're gonna thank me
for it, okay?
It's a story
about a boy and his dog.
[laughs]
One day, the dog
went out into the forest
And got bitten by a raccoon
that had rabies.
And the dog
slowly went insane.
The father made the boy
take the dog behind the barn
and made the son
shoot the dog.
Your deal
is the rabid dog.
It's a very bad idea,
and I really want to shoot it.
If you won't let me,
I have to say I'm out.
I think you've missed the entire
point of online dating.
People like online dating
because of the anonymity
and because
they're really busy.
I just think that the entire
premise is flawed.
If I have the courage to go up
to a woman like you
and hand you the card, I have
the courage to ask you out.
I think it's
a flawed business premise.
I'm out.
It's a cute idea, but it hasn't
been working for you, and --
It hasn't been working because
my website's been broken.
My website is fixed.
You know, I just read on your
Facebook wall the other day,
"The biggest mistake
anyone can make
is to be afraid
to make mistakes."
I've made every mistake
I can possibly make,
and I will take this
to the next level...
It's --
...with a small financial boost.
I will.
You can't let fear stop you
from moving forward,
but I think, here,
sometimes you have to see
that something isn't working
and really open your eyes wide
and look at that and say,
"Maybe I need
to do something different."
For whatever reason,
it's not really working for you,
and I don't think
it was just the website.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Barbara, I know you invest
in people.
You know, uh, I can't fault you
for your obvious passion.
When I started
a flower business,
for two years,
I killed myself.
I totally believed in
a "Flower of the Week" club.
No one had it. I loved flowers.
I loved my customers.
I killed myself.
I worked 24 hours a day.
But you want to know
what I wasn't doing?
Listening to the universe
that was telling me
it wasn't working.
You got to move on,
because it's stopping you
from going to what
you're supposed to be.
That stupid flower business,
if I had hung on to it,
would have never let me
be a millionaire.
You're the right entrepreneur,
but this is the wrong business.
You got to move on.
That's a great story.
And that's exactly
what I was saying.
I say it better.
Just shoot it.
[chuckles]
You in, or you out,
Barbara?
I forgot to say, "I'm out."
painfully, I'm out.
Thank you all very much.
Good luck, Lori.
Wow.
She's not gonna give up.
That's the sad part.
I'm gonna change the world.
I'm not quitting this idea.
I believe in this
more than anything,
and I'm not gonna stop until
this becomes a household name.
