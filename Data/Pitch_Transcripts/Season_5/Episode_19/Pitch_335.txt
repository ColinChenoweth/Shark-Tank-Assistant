get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks
in hopes
of getting an investment
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.
We've sold over 500 units.
Why isn't it more?
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
I think
the idea sucks.
With u-lace,
the possibilities are endless.
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea,
they're ready to invest
using their own money.
JOHN:
You're the real deal,
considering an estimated 70%
of nighttime
car-on-bike collisions
can be attributed
to inadequate side visibility.
We want to eliminate
that statistic,
that's figuring out forward
at all times.
O'LEARY:
One size fits all?
You made $600,000
in what period of time?
So, that's in about
10 months of sales.
How much of that
is profit?
So, we have not become
profitable yet.
Okay.
So, we --
what does it cost you
to make it?
The next order we're gonna place
is $100, about.
costs 10 times more,
though.
Oh, yeah. I mean,
those cost, like, 20 bucks.
Yeah.
But do you have any competition
in this space
for doing something
that's a very bright light
that's screaming, "a bike
is right here. watch out."
so, there is nothing
that provides the visibility
patch that we do.
My background
is mechanical engineering.
I was actually
at the jet-propulsion lab,
which is NASA's
unmanned-space-flight wing.
I was on the Mars
science lab mission.
Wow, we've never
had somebody come in here
You'd better not
be wasting my time, man.
[ laughing ]
I'm -- I'm absolutely
not wasting your time.
Thank you very much.
JOHN: Good luck, guys.
T-thank you.
So, basically,
what Mr. Cuban accused him of
was being here
for only exposure.
I offered the guy an offer.
He didn't say no to me.
What he said was,
in a nice way,
"I'd like to hear
what other people say."
I now work on the business
full time
while staying at home
to take care of our kids.
Elijah, let's go!
Let's go!
Being a stay-at-home mom
If I hear that squeak
one more time..."
[ squeaking ]
that's the sound of money
to me.
[ squeaking ]
Well, how much money
have you made?
How many
have you sold?
We've sold
over 500 units.
We've -- we've made t-- over t--
a little over $10,000 in sales.
Full-time moms
don't get enough respect
in our culture right now.
that's not the issue.
Wait, wait, wait.
But that's not the issue.
That's not the issue.
There's somebody
who's working full time.
Yeah, absolutely.
They're not cutting
half the day off, right?
They're not going
to another job.
To think that
that person working full time
doesn't have an advantage
is lying to yourself.
I'm out.
Look, I have no problem
with the fact that you're a mom
I just felt that
we would spend more time arguing
than anything else.
that is just --
oh, man,
not -- not so, no so.
That's not gonna happen,
Daymond.
You actually
considered investing?
That is just my feeling.
That's not gonna happen.
How can we
convince you otherwise?
Because we're --
we're a dynamic team.
Because you're not
letting me speak now, either.
Okay.
I'm out.
Oh, Daymond.
So, can we call you
when we have some sales?
Come back to the tent
in a couple years
good luck, you guys.
if you get there.
Many have proven us wrong.
Thank you.
[ squeaking ]
That's the sound of money.
Thank you.
Oh, I hated that product.
Can you imagine that
every two seconds?
GREINER:
Oh, my God. No, I can't.
I hated that product.
I can't imagine it.
This would make me crazy.
We tried. Yeah.
I'm a stay-at-home mom.
I'm trying to start a company.
[ voice breaking ]
I feel like I can do this,
It's time to change shoe care,
Showing up on time,
having a clean pair of shoes --
goes a long way.
To be successful, you got to
  look successful in most things.
Until you become Mr. Cuban.
Then you can look like a slob.
Hey, I've always been a slob.
It's worked.
But I respect someone with
a good-looking pair of shoes.
Just -- I don't know
at this point
whether you've developed
the market or not,
Hello, sharks.
My name is Tim talley.
I'm from Rochester, New York.
My company is u-lace,
So, Tim, how do I tighten it
once it's in?
The cool thing about it is
that you can fine-tune the fit
um, by -- by changing
the design pattern.
So, there are design patterns
that are very loose.
We have skateboard kids that
like to have a very loose fit.
Oh, so you can stretch
it across two holes
for extra tightness?
You get to choose any two
eyelet holes on the shoe
right. Oh, I see.
Per -- p-per u-lace.
How much?
We sell that pack
for $3.49.
Yes.
Tim,
why isn't it more?
Yeah.
You've got distribution
in place.
After four years,
why isn't it more?
I'll tell you why it isn't more.
We came out in 2009.
We were named
number-one hot new product
So, Tim, my little risk antenna
just went up
because trendspotting
is meaning
that a trend comes,
peaks, goes.
No, that's a fad.
[ laughter ]
Well...
No, that's a fad.
You got him!
Ba-bam!
GREINER: Well said.
That's a fad. A trend --
a trend can last for
many, many, many years.
Yeah,
but poo-poo happens,
Why is that, Tim?
I think because we didn't have
the product configuration right,
you're right,
the first time is hard.
What if I wanted
to play a pickup game?
Can it hold up, you know,
so I can play in these?
You know,
I can play in these.
O'LEARY:
I rarely do this,
but I'm gonna ask Daymond
for some advice.
Yes, you should bathe more
often, 'cause I sit next to you.
[ laughter ]
So, bottom line is what?
How long is this
gonna stay trendy?
It could be forever.
You think that?
This could be
a long player.
I'm interested.
No, you know what?
Matter of fact, I don't think
this is gonna last much longer.
[ laughter ]
Tim, what's the projection
for u-lace?
We believe we can do
almost $2 million next year.
What?!
I believe so.
It's a big ramp,
my friend.
Tell me -- tell me how --
tell me what the game plan --
we basically want to go
back to those guys,
to -- to the big retailers
that are very interested,
But, Tim,
the key to the strategy
is getting
a couple large retailers.
That's the only way
you're gonna get to $2 million.
Absolutely.
I'm gonna make this easy,
because, you know, I like you.
I think you're a hero.
I think the idea --
he's not a zero?
He's not a zero.
Well, that's good.
That's good news.
My mom will be happy
to hear that.
He's a hero.
But one of the problems
I have with this --
I don't find it
very comfortable,
because I'm feeling
these little pieces underneath
hitting
the top of my foot.
We -- we recommend that you wear
a shoe with a padded tongue.
It is a --
it is a fashion product.
Most kids don't care,
though, right?
The kids that are
doing this, like --
kids don't.
I mean,
they're either not --
their -- their shoelaces
are completely undone,
"Tim, I'm sorry
I didn't believe in you
as much
as you believed in yourself."
I think this will do
extremely well.
I just don't think, for me,
um, this is the right product.
I'm out.
Look, Tim,
I love that story.
I think if so many other people
just learn from that --
get rid of the stuff
that doesn't matter in your life
So, you've kept me in
this entire time
simply because of you.
What I think you need
is you need
somebody with the experience
that's gonna help you.
Tim has three more chances
to make a deal.
HERJAVEC:
Daymond. Fashion guru.
I'm a little -- yeah, I'm-a get
a little nervous, 'cause --
yeah. Daymond,
this is right up your alley.
Okay.
I'm going to...
T-the real challenge
I have is
I'm a partner in a company
called snkrbst,
TALLEY:
Awesome. Thank you.
Great job, Tim.
GREINER: Great job.
You did great.
Thank you, guys.
A deal with Mark
is totally amazing.
He's connected to sports,
he's connected to licensing,
