Hello, sharks.
My name is Kent frankovich.
I'm a mechanical engineer
from San Francisco, California,
and co-founder of revolights.
I am seeking $150,000
in exchange
for 10% of my company.
So, traditional bike lights
generally consist of a small,
forward-facing white light
that mounts to your handlebars
and a small,
rear-facing red light
that mounts
to the back of your bike.
Well, we think
this approach is incorrect,
FRANKOVICH: So, demand has been
overwhelming for our product,
but in order to make this thing
really take off,
we need to get to
a more mainstream price,
lower our cost of goods,
and for that,
I need your help.
Who wants to come up
and check out the lights?
Ooh!
CUBAN:
I'll try your lights.
[ Greiner chuckles ]
CUBAN: By the way,
that's what Daymond wears
when he rides his bike.
huh?
[ laughing ] Okay.
Trust me. Daymond doesn't
ride a bike -- ever.
Of course I do.
All right, you got to
really start going.
Yeah.
Okay.
Kent, how did you come up with
this idea, while he's riding?
So, I originally
had the idea
riding home from my lab
at Stanford in grad school.
Um, I finished up,
and I was going through
a lot of dark patches,
and I was just hitting bumps
and potholes at the last minute,
and I finally said
to myself,
"man, I need
a better headlight."
and so --
but I started thinking,
I didn't want to just go
and buy a more bright headlight.
I wanted to make
a more efficient headlight
by putting the light
where it's needed --
as far forward and close
to the ground as possible.
O'LEARY: Before you finish,
let us -- I want to look at it.
I want to see
how this is facing forward.
Yeah, come on up.
Check it out.
So, the way it works,
there's rings of LEDs.
They attach to your wheel,
so as they go, there's --
at low speeds,
there's an accelerometer
Kent,
I'll make you an offer.
Okay.
Incredibly clever
and smart idea,
thank you.
And you must be Croatian,
with a name like frankovich.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Yep. I am.
Did you come over in
a boat with a little
rice and rats in it?
Yeah, absolutely.
[ laughs ]
so, you're asking
for $150,000 for 10%?
Correct.
I'll give you $300,000
for 10%.
Oh! Wait a minute.
GREINER: Whoo!
I think your value
is actually too low.
I do think
you undervalued it.
Robert, you're trying
to undercut me.
No kidding, bozo.
Yeah, well, you better
put in your mouthpiece,
'cause this is
about to get ugly.
NARRATOR: Kent has three offers
on the table,
but Robert
has generously offered
double the money
that Kent was seeking.
So, you're asking
for $150,000 for 10%.
Correct.
I'll give you $300,000
for 10%.
Oh! Wait a minute.
GREINER: Whoo!
I think your value
is actually too low.
Robert, you're trying
to undercut me.
No kidding, bozo.
Yeah, well, you better
put in your mouthpiece,
'cause this is
about to get ugly.
GREINER: Wow.
That is an incredibly generous
offer, Robert.
I have to put
the ego aside,
and I don't want
to get into a bidding war.
I'm gonna have to say
Robert did give you
a very...generous offer.
I'll step out.
Thank you again
for the offer, Daymond.
I'm still here.
[ laughter ]
Robert, you have
an incredible offer.
I would like to see
if any of the sharks
who are still in
would like to make an offer,
as well, before I decide.
Such a nice way
to say no.
Robert's right. It's worth
a lot more. And you know that.
You have your background
and your experience
and $600,000 in sales.
People are probably
throwing money at you.
You don't come in and ask
for a $1.5 million valuation.
Unless you're screwing with us,
it makes no sense whatsoever.
I think there's no chance
on God's green Earth
that this deal
could ever possibly close,
because you'd be an idiot
among your friends
to value this company at
$1.5 million or even $3 million.
It doesn't add up.
Did you just insult him?
Yes!
Because
he's insulting us.
Mark Cuban just crapped on you.
What do you say?
So, here's the response.
I think that we have absolutely
been looking to find investment.
The fact is,
coming and talking to you guys
and the connections
that you have
and the networks
that you have
and the experience
that you have --
you are
so full of [bleep]
excuse my French.
Connections is
the least of your worries.
And I'm just --
I'm being brutally honest.
Robert offered you
twice...
Of what you asked for.
...What you were asking for
at the same valuation.
You didn't even put up
a little bit of a smile.
So, what are you doing,
Mark?
I'm out.
Wow.
I feel like
Mark has brought up something
GREINER: Kent.
that I really
need to defend.
One second.
Lori's gonna --
well, wait a second.
Well, then, do it,
Kent. Do it.
GREINER: Well, you go ahead.
Answer it. Answer it, answer it.
Okay, so --
you have the guts.
Don't let people
talk down to you like that.
You were so smart,
capital was not a problem.
You were smart enough
to come on here,
push down the valuation
'cause that opens that door...
At the very least, you're
suspicious of his motivations?
Yes.
The first -- the first thing
that you're bringing up
is that capital's not a problem,
which is not accurate.
I've been working
for a year and a half,
and so has all the other people
in our office,
without being paid,
so, no,
capital is actually an issue.
And, frankly,
the way I see this show
is we are able to partner
with somebody
who has amazing connections,
who has the ability to get us
to the point where we need to be
to start
really moving product.
So, why won't you
just say yes to Robert?
$300,000 for 10%.
Bam -- you got the capital,
you got connections.
Yes.
Say yes!
Because
he's a nice guy.
You know, not everybody
is super-aggressive,
full of themselves,
like you.
How do you feel,
making a great offer,
and he's not answering you
right now?
You know what?
You might be right.
Kent might never close
with me,
but I'm not getting that vibe
from the guy.
Okay.
You're also not getting
an answer from him.
Make your own deal.
Make your own deal.
He knows that we're out
over here.
Do your own deal, Robert.
I made an offer.
Kevin, I greatly appreciate
your offer,
but I'm gonna have to say,
I need to go with Robert.
O'LEARY: Wow.
GREINER:
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Kent.
