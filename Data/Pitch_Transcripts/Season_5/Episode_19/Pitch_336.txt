Hello, sharks.
My name is Kent frankovich.
I'm a mechanical engineer
from San Francisco, California,
Kent, how did you come up with
this idea, while he's riding?
So, I originally
had the idea
riding home from my lab
at Stanford in grad school.
Um, I finished up,
Kent,
I'll make you an offer.
Okay.
NARRATOR: Kent has three offers
on the table,
but Robert
has generously offered
double the money
that Kent was seeking.
So, you're asking
for $150,000 for 10%.
Correct.
I'll give you $300,000
for 10%.
Oh! Wait a minute.
GREINER: Whoo!
I think your value
is actually too low.
Robert, you're trying
to undercut me.
No kidding, bozo.
Yeah, well, you better
put in your mouthpiece,
'cause this is
about to get ugly.
GREINER: Wow.
That is an incredibly generous
offer, Robert.
I have to put
the ego aside,
GREINER: Kent.
that I really
need to defend.
One second.
Lori's gonna --
well, wait a second.
Well, then, do it,
Kent. Do it.
GREINER: Well, you go ahead.
Answer it. Answer it, answer it.
Okay, so --
you have the guts.
Don't let people
talk down to you like that.
You were so smart,
capital was not a problem.
You were smart enough
to come on here,
push down the valuation
'cause that opens that door...
At the very least, you're
suspicious of his motivations?
Yes.
The first -- the first thing
that you're bringing up
is that capital's not a problem,
which is not accurate.
Kent might never close
with me,
but I'm not getting that vibe
from the guy.
Okay.
You're also not getting
an answer from him.
Make your own deal.
Make your own deal.
He knows that we're out
over here.
Do your own deal, Robert.
I made an offer.
Kevin, I greatly appreciate
your offer,
but I'm gonna have to say,
I need to go with Robert.
O'LEARY: Wow.
GREINER:
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Kent.
