I'm Lisa.
And I'm Ivan.
And we're from
Los Angeles, California.
[ squeals ]
We have two children.
Our son, Elijah, is 5,
and our daughter, Vivian, is 2.
Wow. That looks
kind of cool.
Our product was inspired
by our kids.
Like most parents,
we want to keep them safe.
We want to know where they are,
what they're doing,
and that they're not
getting into something
that they shouldn't.
IVAN:
When Elijah was first born,
Lisa and I were both so busy,
so her mom was a huge help
and would watch Elijah,
and he's
an active little guy.
He would be crawling around,
getting bruises and scrapes.
My mom suggested
that I design something
that gave him
a little extra protection
but also helped her
keep an ear out
for where he was
and what he was doing.
Well,
after I make the lunches,
then I'll get started
on your breakfast.
Hi. I'm Lisa.
And I'm her husband,
Ivan.
And we created
squeeky knees.
We're asking for $80,000
in exchange for a 20% equity
in our company.
There's nothing
more important to parents
than keeping their kids
safe,
and our product
does just that.
Squeeky knees are
soft, squeaky pants
for the baby
on the go.
I'm a stay-at-home mom
of two young children,
and our kids
do not stop.
When our son began crawling,
I noticed
that his knees would become
bruised and scuffed.
To top it off,
I couldn't leave the room
without him
getting into something.
I needed a product that
not only protected his knees,
but integrated
a fun sound
so I could keep an ear out
for where he was.
There was clearly a problem,
and now we have a solution --
squeeky knees.
[ squeaking ]
[ baby coos ]
[ laughs ]
[ squeaking ]
[ laughs ]
[ squeaking ]
Oh, my goodness.
[ squeaking ]
Squeeky knees are
infant and toddler legwear
that have
built-in knee pads
and a squeaker device that makes
a fun and entertaining sound
when babies crawl.
Their knees stay protected,
and kids love wearing them.
EVANS: So, sharks,
who wants to make some noise
in the baby industry with us?
I'm gonna pass out
some product.
[ laughing ]
All right.
So, you took a doggie toy and
you put it in knees for kids?
[ chuckles ]
That's not exactly it.
But close enough, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Doesn't it get
irritating?
I can completely understand
where you might think that,
but, like, I come home
from a long, hard day at work,
and when I see my son and
my daughter crawling in those,
[ all squeaking ]
making those noises,
it's, like, an endearing sound.
It's -- I love it.
I love that sound.
Yeah, 'cause
you weren't home all day.
Your wife is going,
"oh, my God!
Lisa, I get that,
but is there a possibility --
and how many are you selling
off your daughter in the park?
For example, when you put
your daughter out in the park,
yeah.
how many people say,
"oh, my gosh. I love that.
I want to buy it"?
Most people do.
I hand them a card,
I say, "visit our website,"
and they do,
and people love them.
Apparently not!
Nobody's buying them.
If people loved them,
do you think
your sales would be higher?
You know what? I do.
But because we can't
market it in a big way --
we don't have
any advertising.
yeah, we've done
literally no marketing.
Wait a second. I have a question
I want to get answered.
We have a website.
Is there a possibility --
people couldn't really
find us, so...
Is there a possibility,
as you're explaining
why you have no sales,
is there a possibility
that nobody wants squeeky knees?
Well, you know what?
There's a possibility
for a lot of things.
Not right now.
No, no, wait a second.
Okay.
I really believe
I may be right.
I think the idea sucks.
And that's why
there's no sales.
Okay.
Is that a possibility,
maybe?
Let me answer this.
Anything is possible.
Don't smile. I'm giving you
a serious accusation.
Through our website,
like I mentioned,
we have limited marketing.
A buyer reached out to us
from zulily,
one of the biggest
targeted flash sites.
They said, "I love your product.
Let's do a deal."
they put us
on their flash site.
We sold through
50% of our product.
They said, "we love it."
how much was it,
though?
It was like 50 pieces.
Guys.
This hurts.
So, you guys, normally,
if something's really great,
people are lining up
to buy it.
They don't just say,
"oh, yay. Give me your card."
maybe this isn't
the right idea.
I'm out.
[ groans ]
Okay, well,
thank you, Lori.
Thank you.
We appreciate it.
One thing --
i-i want to say this.
We haven't really
gotten it out there.
We're at the point
right now,
this is like the jump-off point,
you get in here now --
right over the cliff,
baby.
you're gonna be able to make
a lot of money.
You're going right down.
You could make a lot of money
on this, worldwide.
We have to think about
middle America, you know?
In some places --
CUBAN:
I like the idea, guys,
but there's a difference
between a product and a company.
JOHN: Absolutely.
You guys are a product.
Right.
But you're a mom and a dad
that has a good idea
and is looking
to turn it into a company.
You're not there yet.
You always have to
run your business
like there's
someone else out there
working 24 hours a day
to kick your butt.
But you're at work,
and you're picking up the kids.
But you know what?
I resent that.
I'm not saying
you can't make it work.
and you're doing it part time
and Ivan's doing it part time.
I just think
it's a little too soon.
I'm out.
Thank you.
All right,
thank you, Robert.
O'LEARY:
The market has spoken,
and it's basically telling you
people hate this product.
I hate it, too.
If you keep investing in it,
you're killing money.
You don't want to do that
to money.
This is a bad idea,
and it's got to go away.
And you were
my favorite.
I'm telling you the truth!
This sucks!
I'm out.
Whew!
Is he still your favorite?
Not anymore.
[ laughs ]
Good for you.
[ laughter ]
Daymond, you're the only one
left in here.
I was -- I --
make some sense of it.
O'LEARY:
What are you gonna do, D.J.?
JOHN:
So, I was rooting for you.
That's why I was
trying to set up, you know,
why it took three years.
It could have been
2 1/2 years in development.
But as everyone spoke,
you not only, you know,
didn't want to take any advice,
but you objected, to the point
where you seem very --
I'm all ears.
I'm sorry. I --
I think we were open.
Listen.
Okay.
When I was on the fence
of investing,
