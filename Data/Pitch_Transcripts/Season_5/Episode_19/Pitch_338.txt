My name is Mike Quinn, and I'm
the creator of the buffer bit.
I am seeking $75,000
for 25% of the business.
You know, before the buffer bit,
I would spend 15, 20 minutes
polishing my shoes
with a shoeshine kit.
The problem is, it's a hassle.
You have somebody do it for you,
and it's expensive.
So, Mike,
all you've done
is you've made a drill bit
with fur on it...
[ chuckles ]
...To replace
an electric polisher.
Yes.
Mike, at the airport,
I got my shoes shined,
and the guy came out with a --
[ imitating drill ]
and he was doing my shoes
with the same thing.
This already exists,
doesn't it?
Well, it -- it exists --
an electric shoe polisher,
and that was actually
the concept of the --
of the invention.
Electric polisher's
about $14.95.
Your bit is how much?
A-a shoe polisher is
much more than $14.95.
How much are they?
$50 to $100.
CUBAN:
And what do you sell these for?
$19.99.
And what does it cost you
to make them?
Right now, it costs me $9
to make each one.
The idea of taking
a power tool to -- to my shoes,
do you think
guys are gonna do that?
I think guys are gonna
look for an excuse
to use
their cordless drill.
[ laughter ]
So true.
I used to work
in a menswear store.
They always say
you can tell a lot about a guy
by his watch
and if his shoes are shined.
Mike, could I try it?
Sure. Yeah, absolutely.
You want to shine
my shoes, Mark?
You can't afford me,
Robert.
And, by the way,
I don't ever wear a watch,
because some of us
don't have to.
GREINER AND JOHN: Ooooh!
Uh, w-what is --
[ mockingly ] oooh!
JOHN:
3:00 in the schoolyard!
Oh, you want to do it here?
Okay, great. Yeah.
[ laughter ]
There you go.
[ whirring ]
Does it always have
that pungent smell like dead --
it doesn't smell.
Oh, that's 'cause
your shoe's off.
GREINER:
That's Mark's foot.
[ laughter ]
[ whirring stops ]
[ laughs ]
[ whirring ]
[ laughs ]
Does it work on that?
[ laughter ]
CUBAN: This actually
works pretty well.
Yeah. Yeah, no.
It sure does.
All right,
well, all right.
We get it.
We get it.
Do you have sales,
Mike?
Well, I just started.
We're nine months into it.
Sales of, um, $30,000.
Mike, is there anything
proprietary about this?
Yeah. Well, we have
a provisional patent granted.
Have you tried selling it
in a hardware store?
I did. Actually, I took it
to two hardware mass retailers.
I brought it in there
just as a guy off the street.
They liked it a lot.
And what happened?
Well, they didn't like
the fact
that I was working out of
my basement on this project.
Mike, I think you've got
a cool product. I really do.
I think you can do
a lot of unique things.
But honestly,
you're not a company yet.
There's no structure to you
at all.
And I don't think
there's enough upside there
where I can get a return
as an investor,
and so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
GREINER: For me,
I don't know enough
about how many men
polish their shoes.
It seems it's a little bit
of a dying breed
because people are going
more and more casual.
So I'm out.
Thank you.
Mike, I just don't see
the application.
I'm out.
Thank you.
O'LEARY: Mike,
I'll tell you a little story.
I'm a member of a group called
the chevaliers du tastevin.
It's a secret society
of burgundy drinkers.
[ laughter ]
And every 90 days, somewhere
in the world, we gather,
And we drink wines
as old as 1902.
But you can't do it unless
you're wearing your tastevin,
which is a tasting cup
made of pure silver.
If the cup is dirty,
you're rejected
from the meeting,
no matter where it's held.
Could be Paris,
could be Rome.
You can't get in.
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.
I keep telling my wife,
"you got to polish my tastevin."
she says,
"polish your own tastevin."
[ laughter ]
I actually think I could
polish my tastevin with this.
But, having said all that,
I'm a buyer of it,
but as an investor,
I'm out.
Thank you.
[ laughing ]
What the hell is a tastevin?
HERJAVEC: Mike, I'm not
a member of a secret society.
I don't even know
what a tastevin is.
I do know
Kevin is full of crap.
[ laughter ]
You will not be invited
to the next meeting.
I know Mark made fun
of the fact he doesn't
have to wear a watch,
but, you know, I think no matter
how successful you get,
it's always the little things
that count.
