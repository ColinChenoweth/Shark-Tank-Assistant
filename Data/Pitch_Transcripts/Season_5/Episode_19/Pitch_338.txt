My name is Mike Quinn, and I'm
the creator of the buffer bit.
I am seeking $75,000
for 25% of the business.
You know, before the buffer bit,
I would spend 15, 20 minutes
polishing my shoes
with a shoeshine kit.
The problem is, it's a hassle.
So, Mike,
all you've done
is you've made a drill bit
with fur on it...
[ chuckles ]
...To replace
an electric polisher.
Yes.
Mike, at the airport,
I got my shoes shined,
Mike, could I try it?
Sure. Yeah, absolutely.
You want to shine
my shoes, Mark?
You can't afford me,
Robert.
Do you have sales,
Mike?
Well, I just started.
We're nine months into it.
Sales of, um, $30,000.
Mike, is there anything
proprietary about this?
Yeah. Well, we have
a provisional patent granted.
Have you tried selling it
in a hardware store?
I did. Actually, I took it
to two hardware mass retailers.
I brought it in there
just as a guy off the street.
They liked it a lot.
Mike, I think you've got
a cool product. I really do.
I think you can do
a lot of unique things.
But honestly,
you're not a company yet.
There's no structure to you
at all.
Mike, I just don't see
the application.
I'm out.
Thank you.
O'LEARY: Mike,
I'll tell you a little story.
I'm a member of a group called
the chevaliers du tastevin.
It's a secret society
of burgundy drinkers.
HERJAVEC: Mike, I'm not
a member of a secret society.
I don't even know
what a tastevin is.
I do know
Kevin is full of crap.
[ laughter ]
You will not be invited
to the next meeting.
I know Mark made fun
of the fact he doesn't
have to wear a watch,
but, you know, I think no matter
how successful you get,
it's always the little things
that count.
