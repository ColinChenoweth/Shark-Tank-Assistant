Isn't that cute?
He fell asleep.
You're Boring him, Amber.
You're Boring him.
Am I b--
Oh, I don't want him
to fall asleep.
That's how--
That's how comfortable he is.
(laughs)
Under the Kane &amp; Couture
umbrella,
we have
our signature premium line
as well as our
value driven lines--
Amber, you wouldn't really
take him out in public
like that, would you?
(Lori) Aw, he's so cute.
(high-pitched Voice) Hi, baby.
He--This is for
special occasions.
(Kevin) Amber, how often does
Kane get invited to a wedding?
Every day.
Well, I mean,
I have had one
(Robert laughs)
Amber, look,
before we get started,
can I ask you
a practical question?
Sure.
When you carry a small dog
around in a bag
for extended periods of time,
what happens if the dog
has to pee-pee or poo-poo?
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
Then you let him out the bag
so he can pee-pee or poo-poo.
Well, does he tell you?
Does he tell you that
that's what he's planning?
Well, you know your dog.
(Robert) Amber,
do you have sales?
My sales in the last year
were just about $90,000.
Wh--Amber, what does that mean,
"They're ready to order"?
I'm putting together
the packages that they like
in order to present them
to them.
Unfortunately, with coming here,
I wasn't able to do so before.
(Lori) So prices for
these things--
Like, I had picked up
this really cute collar.
Mm-hmm.
Amber, are you kidding?
I have children.
I don't need a dog.
(chuckles) Oh...
that is ridiculous.
How many years did you say
you've been in business?
Sorry, Amber, maybe I missed
how you're going to go
from $90,000 to $1.8 million...
$1.8--
in one year.
Let me tell you.
'cause that would be
faster growth than Fubu.
Uh, well, let me tell you.
Absolutely.
But, Amber, they can buy
dog crap from anybody.
(whimpers)
Well, I don't have dog crap.
I have very nice dog items.
I don't mean it in--
in a negative way.
Good for you.
I don't mean it
in a negative way.
Kevin.
You know what I mean.
You don't mean that
in a negative way?
Why would they be different than
anybody else's dog tchotchkes?
Well, why would your suit
be different from
anybody Else's suit?
Yeah, but...
Amber, I didn't have
a problem with projections.
I had a problem with
the way that you said
You were going to do it.
Okay.
For you to go from $90,000
to $1.8 million in 12 months
would be... unbelievable.
To go from where you are now
to that level of sales,
I mean, that just, uh, it--
It just lacks reality to me.
For that reason, I'm out.
(mark laughs)
Okay. Thank you.
(whispers) Come here.
That dog saw the bow tie
just now.
(laughter)
So I'm gonna make you an offer.
Whoa.
I think that this
can go somewhere. I really do.
But why? Why?
Because people love their pets.
Bottom line. But...
it's contingent on
Daymond going in with me.
(sighs)
I think that Daymond
can offer a lot
Thanks, guys.
Amber, thank you.
(shrieks) Yay!
(chuckles)
(shrieks)
What did you see in her?
(Kevin)
Lori, she dresses dogs.
You know what? You are
judging her way too harshly.
Well, that's why I kept quiet.
I didn't want to be a hater.
What--what's this hater stuff?
The dog has a bow tie on.
You know what?
It's ridiculous.
Now I'm gonna prove you wrong.
You know me.
