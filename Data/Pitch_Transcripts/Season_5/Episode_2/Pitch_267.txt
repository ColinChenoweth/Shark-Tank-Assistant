is my dog Kane,
and I am Amber Lee Forrester,
the founder and president
of Kane &amp; Couture.
I am seeking
a $150,000 investment
for a 33% stake in my company.
Kane &amp; Couture is
a canine lifestyle brand...
offering fashionable,
functional collars,
harnesses, leashes, carriers,
apparel, and useful accessories.
Puts the style in you
and your doggy's lifestyles.
(chuckles)
When I started Kane &amp; Couture,
I found that most of the items
on the market
were plaid, plain,
or suburban.
Most of the unique items
were grossly overpriced
and hard to find.
Kane and Couture...
(snoring)
(laughter)
(Robert) Aw.
Isn't that cute?
He fell asleep.
You're Boring him, Amber.
You're Boring him.
Am I b--
Oh, I don't want him
to fall asleep.
That's how--
That's how comfortable he is.
(laughs)
Under the Kane &amp; Couture
umbrella,
we have
our signature premium line
as well as our
value driven lines--
The Bubba dog collection
and imperial pup.
But, sharks, I'd rather
show you than tell you.
Meet Dina and Henry.
Henry is ready for
his day out on the town.
Aww...
look at--
(Lori) Aw.
(chuckles)
He's outfitted in our
boyfriend button-down shirt
and our easy and convenient
step-In one-piece
harness and Leash.
Henry is so embarrassed
right now.
He does. He looks very cute.
(chuckles)
Yeah.
And next, we have
Courtney and Solstice.
Oh, wow.
Solstice can get in touch
with her feminine side...
(kisses)
in our remi pink collar
and matching leash.
And Mr. Casey Kane
loves to travel in style.
He is riding in
one of our signature
Kane &amp; Couture carriers.
They are designed
to look like purses.
But they're actually suited
for the comfortable travel
of your pet.
(laughter)
(Lori) Aw.
I really need
an amazing partner
to help me take this
to the next level.
So, sharks,
I'd like to discuss
how we can take a bite
into this industry together.
Can I see Kane?
Yeah.
Amber, you wouldn't really
take him out in public
like that, would you?
(Lori) Aw, he's so cute.
(high-pitched Voice) Hi, baby.
He--This is for
special occasions.
(Robert kisses
and Imitates dog whimpers)
if he's going to a wedding,
people love to take
their dogs places,
and they want
to dress them up.
(Kevin) Amber, how often does
Kane get invited to a wedding?
Every day.
Well, I mean,
I have had one
that he's come to
and worn a tuxedo. (chuckles)
and...
I have to come look.
(Robert laughs)
Amber, look,
before we get started,
can I ask you
a practical question?
Sure.
When you carry a small dog
around in a bag
for extended periods of time,
what happens if the dog
has to pee-pee or poo-poo?
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
Then you let him out the bag
so he can pee-pee or poo-poo.
Well, does he tell you?
Does he tell you that
that's what he's planning?
Well, you know your dog.
And so you'll know his
pee-pee and poo-poo pattern.
Kevin, do you never--
Have ever had a pet?
(Kevin) Has---has--
Has Kane ever pee-peed
in a bag?
So he's 6 years old.
He's been trained.
America wants to know
what happens
when he's in the bag.
Oh, my.
So Kane is 6 years old.
Yeah.
He's been traveling
since he was 8 weeks old.
That's a 50-year-old dog
in dog years.
Uh, Yeah, yeah,
I mean, well--
and usually when you turn 50
you have to go more often.
You gotta go.
You get a little incontinent.
(laughs)
So I was just wondering...
so maybe my next invention
should be, like,
some doggy diaper
that's cute?
Well, no, we've seen that
already, thank you.
(laughs)
(Robert) Amber,
do you have sales?
My sales in the last year
were just about $90,000.
And how do you sell?
Through what? Retail?
Online?
Yes, so I sell through
retail and online.
(Daymond)
What are the major retailers?
Macy's carries my products
on a seasonal, um--
Really? Macy's?
Amber, what will
your sales be next year?
My projection in the next year
is $1.8 million.
From $90,000 to $1.8 million?
You're gonna get from--Huh?
Well, I have people
who are ready to order
starting the holiday
this year.
So I'm ready to get
very aggressive.
Wh--Amber, what does that mean,
"They're ready to order"?
I'm putting together
the packages that they like
in order to present them
to them.
Unfortunately, with coming here,
I wasn't able to do so before.
(Lori) So prices for
these things--
Like, I had picked up
this really cute collar.
Mm-hmm.
And it says, "Sparked."
Yes.
So what would this cost
you to make,
and then what do you sell it
to the retailer for,
and what do they sell it for?
Uh, about $3.
Right, and what are they
selling it for?
They're selling them from
anywhere from $20 to $24.
What's the difference
between your stuff
and the millions
of other products
that are out there like it?
Wait, let me answer.
Nothing.
No, that's not True,
actually.
Well, what is it?
So the difference is
it's a brand.
You also have--
but I don't know
the Kane &amp; Couture brand.
Not at $90,000 a year in sales.
You have no brand.
Well, people are learning
our brand.
And I kind of feel like
I'm, like, the fubu for dogs.
Like... (chuckles)
(chuckles)
(laughter)
Great.
I'm okay with that.
It's true. There wasn't
a lot of really, like,
like, there was--It was
plaid, plain, or suburban.
I really mean that.
There weren't like, like,
how we have our
boyfriend button-downs and--
Boyfriend button-down for a dog.
Yes.
That dog has a bow tie on.
Yes.
That's insane.
It's not to everyone,
just maybe to you.
It's crazy.
Do you have a dog?
No, thank goodness.
Amber, are you kidding?
I have children.
I don't need a dog.
(chuckles) Oh...
that is ridiculous.
How many years did you say
you've been in business?
So I've been in business
about four and a half years.
I've been full time with it
for three years.
Within that time,
I've gone to some classes.
I've also had a baby
and got married.
So it's been a full
four and a half years.
Sorry, Amber, maybe I missed
how you're going to go
from $90,000 to $1.8 million...
$1.8--
in one year.
Let me tell you.
'cause that would be
faster growth than Fubu.
Uh, well, let me tell you.
Absolutely.
And I-I even feel that that
could be somewhat conservative.
(laughs)
Because I'm already in front
of seven major retailers
who are ready to place orders.
Even if I just started
in 10% of their stores,
then I can get
to $1.8 million.
These major retailers--
You have hard copy orders?
I have--I will have
hard copy orders.
I don't have hard copy
orders today. I--
I'm in discussions with them.
And so...
and So, as you know--
I'm sorry, Amber, I'm not sure
what that means.
I-I've been in sales
for a long time.
Okay.
I know there's a lot of talk
before Somebody actually
gives you an order.
Yes.
Just like my sales guys
always come back and tell me.
Well, I've had orders
from them before.
It's not like I'm just saying
that I'm gonna get orders.
But, Amber, they can buy
dog crap from anybody.
(whimpers)
Well, I don't have dog crap.
I have very nice dog items.
I don't mean it in--
in a negative way.
Good for you.
I don't mean it
in a negative way.
Kevin.
You know what I mean.
You don't mean that
in a negative way?
Why would they be different than
anybody else's dog tchotchkes?
Well, why would your suit
be different from
anybody Else's suit?
Yeah, but...
name me one dog collar brand
outside of Kane &amp; Couture.
Like, give me another
brand dog collar.
I would rather not.
But there isn't one.
Listen, I-I think--
I think I'm coming down
with a fever
'cause I just saw a dog
go by with a bow tie on.
(laughter)
I just--I'm sorry.
That gave you a fever?
I don't get it,
and I hope I'm dreaming.
But while I'm dreaming
in this nightmare,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Sorry, was he out?
Yes, he's out. Yes.
(laughter)
There it is again.
(laughs)
I love the dog.
See, he's Loving Kane
in his tuxedo.
Oh.
What would be
a sales projection
that you would
actually expect
for a company that's
at my level? Like, where--do--
Amber, I didn't have
a problem with projections.
I had a problem with
the way that you said
You were going to do it.
Okay.
For you to go from $90,000
to $1.8 million in 12 months
would be... unbelievable.
To go from where you are now
to that level of sales,
I mean, that just, uh, it--
It just lacks reality to me.
For that reason, I'm out.
(mark laughs)
Okay. Thank you.
(whispers) Come here.
That dog saw the bow tie
just now.
(laughter)
So I'm gonna make you an offer.
Whoa.
I think that this
can go somewhere. I really do.
But why? Why?
Because people love their pets.
Bottom line. But...
it's contingent on
Daymond going in with me.
(sighs)
I think that Daymond
can offer a lot
on the fashion and--
and distribution end as well.
I do, too.
So, Daymond...
I think I would like
to make her an offer...
(laughs)
$75,000/$75,000 for... 40%.
For what percentage?
Daymond, I think that
we could do--
Really help her to do
good things with this.
I am stunned, and I am
going to forbid them to do that.
You are being a hater
right now.
So, Daymond, you haven't
said anything yet.
Are you in with Lori?
Thanks, guys.
Amber, thank you.
(shrieks) Yay!
(chuckles)
(shrieks)
What did you see in her?
(Kevin)
Lori, she dresses dogs.
You know what? You are
judging her way too harshly.
Well, that's why I kept quiet.
I didn't want to be a hater.
What--what's this hater stuff?
The dog has a bow tie on.
You know what?
It's ridiculous.
Now I'm gonna prove you wrong.
You know me.
That was a lot of hard work.
And that was really intense.
(high-pitched voice)
You did it!
(exhales deeply)
