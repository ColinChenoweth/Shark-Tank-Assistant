My name
is Charles Michael Yim,
(Robert) Charles,
what should we toast to?
(clink)
Uh, pitching to the sharks.
(chuckles)
To you, Charles.
Thank you.
Sometimes it ends badly,
though.
(chuckles)
so you know how it goes.
You eat some food,
you have some drinks.
Before you know it,
the night's over,
What do you sell them for,
Charles?
$49.99.
Could we see it?
Could we see it?
Yes.
(chuckles)
I thought that one of
the biggest issues
around these things--
than blood pricking, right?
Charles, how did you
develop it?
Are you a software guy?
Are you a hardware design guy?
So I used to code
back in the day.
Oh... (laughs)
(Robert) All right.
Here's what I'll do, Charles.
I'll give you another $250,000
if Kevin will have me on that.
I'll do it. That makes
a lot of sense to me.
Charles has the potential
of raising $1 million--
All the funding he needs
at this point--
if Mark will join the rest
of the sharks on a deal.
Daymond, you're--
You're in on this, aren't you?
I'm willing to go in
if Cuban's in,
Oh, Charles, think.
You gotta come up
with a really good offer.
Okay.
Hey, Matt, how's it goin'?
Hey, Charles.
So they have basically,
uh, all have, uh,
provided an offer--
Um, all five of them.
Charles, welcome back.
Thank you.
You have an opportunity
to get all five sharks
(Lori) We all should toast
to that.
Charles, have a toast with us.
(laughs)
All right. Cheers, guys.
(Robert) Cheers!
(clinks)
(all) cheers!
I've never thought about
raising all the cash
that we needed
from the entire team
of the sharks.
I'm ecstatic right now.
I have no words. (chuckles)
I'm shocked.
