My name
is Charles Michael Yim,
and I'm the Founder and C.E.O.
of Breathometer.
I'm asking for $250,000
for 10% equity stake
in my company.
So just imagine
you're at a dinner party
or maybe even a tailgate.
Better yet, we're at
a local bar with some friends
having some Champagne.
Would anyone care for a glass?
Yes, please.
(Lori) Sure.
(Robert chuckles) Yeah.
(chuckles)
Oh, I-I thought
you were joking.
(speaks indistinctly)
Take it, Lori.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Daymond doesn't like
Champagne, so I'll take his.
(chuckles)
I was told he does.
(Lori laughs)
Here you go.
Thank you.
It's Daymond's favorite drink.
(chuckles)
(clink)
Thank you, señor.
Thank you.
(Lori chuckles)
(Robert) Charles,
what should we toast to?
(clink)
Uh, pitching to the sharks.
(chuckles)
To you, Charles.
Thank you.
Sometimes it ends badly,
though.
(chuckles)
so you know how it goes.
You eat some food,
you have some drinks.
Before you know it,
the night's over,
and it's time to go home.
And the most important
question is,
"Are you safe to drive"?
And...
who would want to carry
one of these
bulky old breathalyzers
around?
So that's why I created...
Breathometer--
The world's first
smartphone breathalyzer.
It's so small,
it can fit in your pocket.
Let me show you
how it works.
You simply retract
the audio jack,
plug it into a smartphone.
(clicks)
Activate the app,
(blows air)
Within a matter of seconds,
You'll be able to know
what your breath
alcohol level is.
And better yet,
it can even tell you
how long it'll take
to sober up.
And if need be,
you can even hail a cab
with the push of a button.
So please join me
on this mission
to help people make
smarter and safer decisions
one breath at a time.
Thank you.
So is this
already on the market?
Are you selling it currently?
So we basically launched
in March
via an indiegogo campaign.
We sold 4,000 units
within 30 days.
We generated $140,000
in revenue.
Indiegogo is
a crowdfunding site. Right.
It's just like kickstarter,
correct.
What do you sell them for,
Charles?
$49.99.
Could we see it?
Could we see it?
Yes.
(chuckles)
I thought that one of
the biggest issues
around these things--
When the first handheld units
came out--
was that you get arrested--
Or worse,
you harm somebody
because you're drunk--
And you relied on the device
to make your decision.
Isn't that a huge liability
to you?
First and foremost, there's no
replacement for good judgment.
And so the Breathometer device
basically promotes,
uh, making smarter
and safer decisions.
We provide
the instruction manual.
We clearly label disclaimers
throughout the app.
And as long as we do our part
and the due diligence
and we uphold our side,
we're in the clear.
Should I come up
and try this with you?
Uh, sure.
Feel free to come up.
Okay.
(Kevin)
And if she doesn't pass...
if I can't walk--
Hey, if she can
walk in those heels,
you already
have your answer.
So...
basically go ahead
and plug it
into the audio jack
of your smartphone.
Um, all you need to do--
Do is hit the start button.
Okay.
Go ahead and breathe
into this hole--
right there.
A little closer.
(blows air)
(chuckles)
You're at a .04 right now.
That would be legal.
Yeah, you're legal.
Does it tell you
if she has bad breath, too?
(Lori chuckles)
Uh, it's funny
as you mention that,
uh, there's an al-also another
sensor we're looking into.
It's for halitosis.
Oh, seriously?
And through--and seriously.
I'm starting to think of this
as more of a multifunction
breathalyzer.
So the next one we're
actually trying to focus on
is, uh, diabetes.
It's in clinical trials.
And it's obviously less
intrusive
than blood pricking, right?
Charles, how did you
develop it?
Are you a software guy?
Are you a hardware design guy?
So I used to code
back in the day.
I built and sold my last company
within 18 months.
So, essentially, I went straight
into developing Breathometer
as soon as I exited
my last company.
If you sold your last business,
and you did very Well,
why didn't you take
some of that money
and invest it in this?
I have. Uh, so I started off
with the first initial $50,000.
I've already raised
half a million dollars
in total from angels.
What are you gonna use
the money for?
Uh, strictly, uh,
manufacturing of the product.
Well, the good news for you
is that both in Europe
and Canada, Mexico, U.S.,
we're going to almost
a zero tolerance
on alcohol and driving.
Correct.
That's the trend.
I'm sure you've heard about
the federal safety board
in the United States
that's trying to push down--
They just lowered it.
From .08 to .05.
I'm--I'm a big fan
of the sensor business.
I've got a company--
Motionloft.
We're all about sensors.
(mouths words)
You know, I think that's
the future of technology.
Okay, I'm gonna make--
I'm gonna make you an offer.
All right. What I'd like to do
is offer you $500,000
for 20% of the company.
That's my offer.
Okay.
I'll give you a chance
to talk to other people
because I know you want to.
Any other sharks? (laughs)
Mark, would you let me
go in with you...
no.
And handle the retail end?
(chuckles)
No. This is not-- I'm not
worried about the retail.
That's just, like, a smidgen
versus the long-Term benefit.
I'll give you $250,000 for 15%.
And you wouldn't have
to lose that much equity then.
That's not bad. Okay.
It's much less diluted
than Mark's 20%.
Okay.
And not nearly as much cash.
So just to open up the--the--
the "Funding channel"
of communication,
so the whole idea
within the next 60 days
is to close a full
$1 million round
from the angels
back in silicon valley.
So what I'm proposing
is I'm more than willing
to open up the round
and potentially involve
more than just one shark
because I think there's
an incredible amount
of value here.
Why don't you let the sharks
do the whole round?
That's what I'm proposing.
(laughs)
I don't--I don't want
to work with the other sharks.
Oh... (laughs)
(Robert) All right.
Here's what I'll do, Charles.
I'll give you another $250,000
if Kevin will have me on that.
I'll do it. That makes
a lot of sense to me.
And I'll give you
another $250,000.
For 30%.
Wow. Okay.
And they have no idea
what they're investing in.
That's not true.
It is absolutely true.
So you've got $750,000--
Three times what
you asked for today...
right.
For 30%.
Right.
You're very smart.
I like to surround myself
with people much smarter
than me.
That's why I have a challenge
being up here.
Thank you very much.
(chuckles)
Um...
I want to, uh,
I think I want to match
what you're offering.
$250,000,
unlimited manufacturing...
okay.
10%.
And you wouldn't want
to partake in the group's...
I've tried to get these
three bobos together
at breakfast one day and--
and--and it's hard, you know?
(laughter)
It's like, we--we don't need
all these people.
(Kevin)
Right now we can't agree.
We've got three, maybe one--
Well, I think we can agree,
Kevin.
What if we raised the dollar
amount we're putting in?
But wait--Wait,
I'm just saying for
a million bucks
of straight equity,
and get all the sharks in it.
Now I don't know if mark
wants to play ball,
but we need a significant
discount to do that.
You would be
an unbelievable story
if that happened.
That's true.
Mark, because of your
previous investments in sensors,
you need the lion's share.
Tell us what that is.
Because competing
with each other
is gonna be very expensive
versus colluding with each other
and giving this guy
every single shark.
Come on, Mr. Cuban.
(chuckles)
Daymond, you're--
You're in on this, aren't you?
I'm willing to go in
if Cuban's in,
and you'll get
all five sharks.
Charles has the potential
of raising $1 million--
All the funding he needs
at this point--
if Mark will join the rest
of the sharks on a deal.
Daymond, you're--
You're in on this, aren't you?
I'm willing to go in
if Cuban's in,
and you'll get
all five sharks.
Come on, Mr. Cuban.
(chuckles)
You get the lion's share.
What does
"The Lion's share" mean?
What--what equity do I get?
So we--
to get all five sharks.
You need a million bucks
for that.
(Lori speaks indistinctly)
Now it's your turn--
now it's your turn to sell me.
(clears throat) Wow. Um...
what can you give us
on a straight equity deal?
This is your round right here.
Right now, the whole damn thing.
Wow, that's pretty serious.
Uh...
Oh, Charles, think.
You gotta come up
with a really good offer.
Okay.
Hey, Matt, how's it goin'?
Hey, Charles.
So they have basically,
uh, all have, uh,
provided an offer--
Um, all five of them.
And so basically
a million dollars,
uh, for 30%, uh,
of the company.
So I just wanna kinda
get your thoughts.
You know, a million for 30--
Um, 30%,
you know, that's
a $3.3 million valuation.
It's not a huge valuation.
Sure.
I mean, I--fundamentally,
I'm a little bit worried about
too many cooks in the kitchen.
I mean, they all have
big egos, um, and so,
you know, can they work together
effectively?
Who wants to bet
what he comes back at?
He'll come back at 25%.
I say 25%.
Yeah, you're right.
Well, let's see what happens.
He's been out there a long time.
(exhales deeply)
Charles, welcome back.
Thank you.
You have an opportunity
to get all five sharks
and the power
of all sharks behind you.
Right.
Here's the deal. $1 million--
$500,000 for Mark Cuban
for 15%, and $500,000...
(chuckles)
from the rest of the sharks.
We're gonna split it.
Right.
For a total of 30%
for $1 million
and the power of "Shark tank."
What are you gonna do?
(Lori) We all should toast
to that.
Charles, have a toast with us.
(laughs)
All right. Cheers, guys.
(Robert) Cheers!
(clinks)
(all) cheers!
I've never thought about
raising all the cash
that we needed
from the entire team
of the sharks.
I'm ecstatic right now.
I have no words. (chuckles)
I'm shocked.
