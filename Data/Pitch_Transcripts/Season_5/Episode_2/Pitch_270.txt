Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim O'Brien.
My company is Man Medals,
Jim, what do you charge
for them?
Retail is $5.
My cost is 65 cents
for that whole package.
We wholesale 'em
for $2.50,
which gives them a price point
for retail stores
which is one of the things
I like that I did--
Jim...
men Like shiny objects.
I think it's a great start.
It's a cute idea.
I think you did
a great presentation today.
But as far as the medals
are concerned, I'm out.
If I'd have come to you
35 years ago
Thank you, sharks.
Good luck, Jim.
Thank you.
Good luck.
That's the first...
that was the...
that was the funniest pitch.
Beefcake-y guy that's
come into the tank.
Barbara would have gone
bonkers.
(laughter)
