I'm Lakesha.
I'm Nzinga.
And I'm Tanecia.
(all) and we're from
Hampton, Virginia.
(Lakesha)
We're basically sisters.
We're best friends
attached at the hip.
Looks like we're ready.
We've been event planners
for over ten years.
We were looking for something
simple and versatile
that we could add to recipes
that would give our events
a unique taste.
So good.
I think this is gonna be
the best batch ever.
We put our heads together,
and the results were incredible.
A little more vanilla.
A lot of people think that Only
chefs can make a gourmet meal,
but our product
makes everyone a chef
because everything it's added to
tastes amazing.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
This business holds
a special place in my heart.
We started this business
when my husband was deployed
in Afghanistan.
It was very challenging,
but also a blessing
because it gave me a distraction
while I was raising
my daughter on my own.
So I feel like we both served
our country in a special way.
We need the sharks
to help us grow our business,
and we're ready to be
nationwide.
The sharks are gonna love
our product.
It's a guarantee.
It's shark bait, baby.
I'm Lakesha.
I'm Nzinga.
And I'm Tanecia.
And our business is mango...
mango...
mango...
(all) Preserves.
We're asking for $75,000
for a 20% investment share
in our company.
We have a gourmet preserve
called "Mango mango."
We call it
"a party in a jar,"
'cause you can use it
over a hundred ways.
(all, singsongy) Spread it,
mix it, shake it, stir it!
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
(laughs)
(laughs)
Spread it...
spread it...
(Lakesha) on toast, bagels,
or even croissants.
Mix it...
mix it...
mix it with cream cheese
for a delicious fruit dip.
Shake it...
shake it...
shake it with red wine vinegar
and olive oil
for a mango-licious vinaigrette.
(singsongy) Stir it...
(singsongy) Stir it...
stir it with Ginger shrimp.
(Tanecia) We've prepared
some samples for you to taste.
So, sharks, are you ready
to...
(all, singsongy) spread it,
mix it, shake it, stir it?
(Nzinga) Come on.
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
Spread it... come on, Lori.
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
What you'll be tasting today
is our mango fruit dip.
(Robert) Thank you.
In the martini glass,
there's some mango lemonade.
And then we have
the mango Ginger shrimp.
It's got a little kick
to it, so...
(Kevin) Let me help you there.
This is delicious.
This drink is made out of
the mango jelly?
(Lakesha) Yes.
We sweetened the lemonade
with our mango preserves.
Lakesha, this shrimp
is fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Wow.
Did you just put that in with
the shrimp when you were--
That's it. Just the shrimp
and the spice. And...
wow.
And the mango preserve.
Oh, try this.
I know. It's really, really,
really good. (chuckles)
I'm going to make
the assumption
that there's lots and lots
of other people
making mango mango mango.
There are a lot of people
making jellies and jams,
but no one is working
their jelly like us.
So you're working the jelly...
we're working the jelly.
And the other guys
aren't working the jelly?
They're not working it
like us.
You work it.
We're doing eight
farmers markets a week.
We're doing shows.
We're doing expos.
Okay, if you're working
the jelly so hard,
what are the sales?
Total year-to-date,
we've made about $138,000.
That's not bad.
(Lori) How long have you
been in business?
About a year and a half.
How are you selling it?
We're selling it
in natural food stores.
We're also selling it in a lot
of specialty and gourmet stores.
What do you sell this for?
We sell it to them
at $3.96.
And they sell it for $6.99.
What's your cost?
Two dollars and--
$2.18.
(Daymond) hmm.
(Kevin) That's high.
Why is it so expensive?
It's mango.
It's a tropical fruit.
What do you need the money for?
We need the money
for our production facility.
We want to take
an existing structure
and purchase the equipment
necessary.
Why don't you farm that out?
Why do you want
to do that yourself?
I think he's referring
to, like, a co-packer.
You would have them
make it instead.
Right.
Ship it, take care of
all of that.
We--we actually do--
We have so much pride
in our product.
We like to be able
to be h-hands-on.
(Kevin) I understand the pride,
but these numbers are not
a good long-term story.
I used to own a company
that made jams and Jellies.
Uh-huh.
And we used to take
our extra capacity...
(laughs)
And we--We'd farm it out
to anybody that wanted it.
(chuckles) is that true?
Not to demean the product,
but frankly,
if you tell us
what your recipe is,
we'll make it for you.
At what point in your life
did you own a jelly and...
(chuckles) Ja--Jam company?
(Lori laughs)
It's true.
Such an evil guy
making jellies and jams.
Yes, I am.
Lakesha, it's a great product.
Tell me about your background.
I'm actually
a military spouse.
We own
an event planning company.
And the other ladies?
I'm actually a physician.
Wow.
I'm a registered nurse.
(Kevin) Listen, ladies,
you have to get the cost
of this down--
To be like everybody else
in the jelly and jam business--
to $1.20.
How are you gonna do that?
(women chuckling)
(Lori laughs)
Robert liked that so little,
that he just took this
small glass full.
What you don't eat, Robert,
I'll take.
That's right.
(Kevin) If--if you looked at
anybody else in your business,
their cost would be at $1.25.
I think owning our own
production facility
is the key to that.
Hey, Lakesha,
what am I eating?
'cause it's like a drug.
(Lori) It's cream cheese.
I cannot stop.
(Lakesha) Yes,
it's cream cheese.
It's cream cheese, right?
Just cream cheese
and the mango mango, that's it.
No other jam or jelly
is gonna taste like that
mixed with cream cheese.
And what are
your projected sales
for this next coming year?
$291,000.
Are you selling it in
any of the military?
(Lakesha) Yes.
We're actually getting ready
to go into
the military commissaries.
(Robert) How big an order
would that be?
Uh, huge. We're--
Uh, that--
So would you go into
all of their stores?
'cause that's a big business.
We will. We will go into
all their stores.
Actually--
(chuckles)
He's eating mine now.
(mark) Robert,
pass that down.
(laughter)
That could be
a very big market.
Pass the cream cheese down,
Robert. Pass the cream cheese.
(speaks indistinctly)
Oh, my God.
Guys, you--You can't make any
money with this model.
Because you can't bring
a distributor into your model.
When you get bigger,
and all of a sudden
you've got a thousand stores,
the problem is
you can't make any money
'cause you've got to give
a distributor a dollar
on each one.
(mark) What comes after
mangoes?
It's all mango.
It's gonna be mango vinaigrette,
we're gonna--
Why aren't you going
into mango chutney?
It's a bigger category
than all of this.
Because you can use
our preserve...
(all) to make a chutney.
Man, you guys know
your mangoes.
(Lakesha) We--
Yes, from sweet to savory
to spicy.
(Kevin) You want to provide
the base.
And you need your product
to make all those
delicious recipes.
(Lakesha) That's right.
Right, right, right.
This stuff is...
Pretty damn good.
(Robert) Just keep talking.
I'm taking bets to see
if I can finish it
by the time you all
are done.
Yes.
(women laugh)
Lakesha, I'm not here.
Just ignore me.
Okay. Okay.
You know, I just have to say
it's a huge testament
because the two sharks
that right now
are watching their weight,
not eating a lot of carbs,
are Mark and Robert.
(mark) It's cream cheese.
(speaks indistinctly)
I used to watch my weight.
That cream cheese can make you
a lot of money.
(Robert) Lakesha, what's your
biggest challenge so far
with the business?
Because it sounds like
you're having a lot of success.
The challenge is production,
keeping up with demand--
Being on someone else's
schedule.
You can't get that money
anywhere else?
We--We could get the money
somewhere else.
We--we could.
But we would like to...
party with Sharks.
Yeah, we would like to party
with the--with the sharks.
We don't want you all to--
Hey, there's nothing like
a shark party.
(laughs)
(laughs) We want the party.
Yeah, we don't want you all
to do all the work.
We want to do the work.
We know the mango.
Guys, I have no doubt
in my mind
you are gonna be the world's
first mango millionaires.
But I don't know a chutney
from a shputney
from a potato.
But you know money.
I know money,
but it's just not my thing.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Keep on jammin'.
(all, singsongy) Spread it,
mix it, shake it, stir it.
Spread it, mix it,
shake it, stir it.
I love you guys. (chuckles)
You know, you've created
a hobby here.
That's what it is.
It's not a business yet.
You are going to find out
the hard way
unless you take out 75 cents
out of your cost,
you're going to zero.
There's a lot of mistakes
in what you're doing.
I actually don't want
to educate you on this
'cause it's not
the "advice" tank.
Sorry to give you
the bad news, but I'm out.
You guys are great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And I don't like mango.
But I loved everything
that was on my plate.
And you saw what Robert
did with it.
I rarely say this.
I don't think it's good
for you to actually give away
equity to a shark,
and I'll tell you why.
I think you should
fund yourselves
with the money that comes in
and retain your equity.
And because that's
my very best advice,
I'm going to go out,
but I hope that
that's what you do
because I see huge success
for you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(Daymond) We tend not to want
to give our counterparts
credit up here, but I found it
fascinating that
Kevin... (chuckles)
Had a jelly and jam business
a couple of years ago.
(laughs)
I'm a sweetheart.
(women laugh)
So I actually have
to follow the lead
of somebody that's been
in this business
and has brought up some
very valuable questions.
I don't think I can be of
service with you in this area.
I'm out.
(exhales deeply)
Well, I hated the presentation.
I hated the food.
(laughter)
We could tell.
I've never had a product on here
that I loved so much.
I mean, I love it,
I love it, I love it.
You guys are the real deal.
Um...
(Nzinga and Tanecia)
Thank you.
We appreciate you all.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Bye-Bye.
Bye-Bye.
(singsongy) Spread it,
shake it, mix it...
(woman chuckle)
(singsongy) Spread it,
mix it, shake it, stir it!
You know what?
They're gonna make it.
Not with these numbers.
They'll figure it out.
That was a fabulous
experience.
Oh, my goodness.
It was so nice to know
that they loved our product.
Oh, my gosh.
And they believe in us.
They believe in us,
and we have to respect that.
Oh, my God.
(singsongy) shake it, stir it,
going to zero.
Shake it, stir...
(laughter)
(Lori) Oh, god.
