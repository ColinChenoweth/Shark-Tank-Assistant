Hello, sharks.
My name is Jim O'Brien.
My company is Man Medals,
and I'm asking for $10,000
for 10%.
Now, sharks,
I could stand here all day
and talk to you about
Man Medals,
but instead I want to show you
how I came up with the idea.
And to do that, I've brought in
my exact body double....
(laughter)
For a historically
accurate re-enactment
of how I came up with
the idea.
This started as
a running joke
between me
and my lovely wife Kathy.
Whether it was flexing
as I picked up my dirty laundry
to put it in the hamper...
(laughs)
(chuckles)
Or...
actually taking
the toilet paper Roll
and putting it
on the Holder,
which guys don't think
is a problem,
but women obviously do.
(laughter)
And those rare occasions when
you would take the toilet seat--
While apparently
sticking my butt out...
(laughter)
And lowering it.
Why is he looking at me?
(Lori) I don't know. (laughs)
Why are you looking at him?
Every time I did this,
my wife would always laugh
and say, "What do you want,
a medal"?
and I thought to myself...
yes... Yes, I do.
(laughter)
and that, sharks, is where
Man Medals came from.
There are six original
Man Medals.
(laughter continues)
I took the garbage out,
I picked my dirty clothes up,
I put the toilet paper roll on,
I put the toilet seat down,
I ran the vacuum cleaner,
and I asked for directions.
I've been selling these online
for less than a year.
And I'm not getting orders
from just in the United States.
I'm getting responses
from Canada, England,
Ireland, Norway, scotland,
and as far away
as australia, new zealand...
even India.
(laughter)
So, sharks, are you ready
to earn a medal?
Ah.
(Lori) Ah. (chuckles)
Ah.
We get a lot
of bad theater in here,
but this was
pretty good bad theater.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
I want to give
your body double
an award for the sexiest look.
So can you raise your eyebrow
again like that?
(laughter)
Can I see you do the same?
Oh, yeah, there's
the body double, yeah.
(Lori laughs)
I have to say, though,
we're always getting girls in
in bikinis. It's about time.
It's a hilarious shtick.
So how many
have you been selling?
I've sold
about $2,500 worth.
(laughter)
A whole $2,500 worth?
I know. I know.
I thought you were selling them
all over the world.
Less than a year, you said?
Honestly, yeah.
$2,500 so far.
You've sold dozens of them.
600.
(laughter)
Hundreds.
I've sold hundreds.
These you see here
are the retail displays.
So all six of these pins--
what you're holding
in your hand
we've only had
for less than a month.
Jim, what do you charge
for them?
Retail is $5.
My cost is 65 cents
for that whole package.
We wholesale 'em
for $2.50,
which gives them a price point
for retail stores
anywhere between $5 and $6.
Have you done, Like, uh,
any type of trade show,
or like a, you know--
(chuckles) Trade shows?
That's the next step for me.
So go do a show
and see first,
is this something that's viable?
And then think about whether
or not you need an investment.
I hope you are successful,
but it won't be with me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I think this idea merits
a full financial ex--
Exploration because
really here...
we're talking about
$10,000 for 10%--
a punitive value of $100,000.
Correct.
Now I look
at the public multiples
of medal companies like this...
(laughter)
So the valuation here
is really aggressive, I think,
I-I mean...
(laughter continues)
You know, there's two things,
though, Kevin,
in talking about that.
The first one is
I know
something about medals.
I spent nine years in the navy
before I got into this.
I earned a couple medals,
actually.
And I know men like medals.
You watch the Olympics,
you get medals.
The--
and the joke tells itself,
which is one of the things
I like that I did--
Jim...
men Like shiny objects.
I think it's a great start.
It's a cute idea.
I think you did
a great presentation today.
But as far as the medals
are concerned, I'm out.
If I'd have come to you
35 years ago
with a rock in a box
and said,
"I'm gonna sell
a million of these,"
you would have laughed at me.
That was before the internet
and before social media.
So with an item like this
that people are talking about--
and I know
it's in small quantities,
but I'm still getting
responses from people
from around the world--
but it's not a business.
I--all due respect,
I beg to disag--beg to--
I beg--
Oh, yeah, because
those $2,500 in Sales
really begs to differ.
Uh, again, this is something
that we're in the ground floor.
(laughter)
And you know what?
The problem is--The problem is
you're in the ground floor--
You're not in the ground floor,
and you're gonna stay
in the ground floor.
You're in the basement.
I'm out.
I forbid you to proceed.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Daymond?
I don't--I don't think
the $2,500 is a big problem.
I stood on a corner
and sold hats the first day
that I made with my hands,
and I made $800. That's it.
It takes as much energy to--
To dream small
as it does to dream big.
So...
but I didn't ask for
anybody's help at that point.
It's gimmicky. It just
isn't for me. I'm out.
Thank you, sharks.
Good luck, Jim.
Thank you.
Good luck.
That's the first...
that was the...
that was the funniest pitch.
Beefcake-y guy that's
come into the tank.
Barbara would have gone
bonkers.
(laughter)
