My name is Henry Miller.
I am 16 years old,
My name is Henry Miller.
I'm from Deming, Washington,
for a 25% stake of my incredible
company, Henry's Humdingers,
the natural condiment,
honey with a kick.
It all started back
when I was 11 years old,
and I sat next to a beekeeper
on a plane.
[Southern accent]
Henry's Humdingers...
[laughter]
[normal voice]
...To Henry's Humdingers LLC.
I take this ancient thing
like honey,
Thanks, Henry.
No problem.
I love the names.
Yep, I currently
have four flavors.
Henry, the Diabolical Dad
is fantastic.
Naughty Nana is, like --
We've made a cheesecake
out of that.
Wow.
Are there other
flavored honeys out there?
There are other
sweet-flavored honeys,
but I have not encountered
another spicy-flavored honey.
Where are you selling?
What retailers are you
in right now?
Right now, I'm in 300-plus
stores in 34 states,
What about
the last 12 months, Henry?
Probably about $50,000, I think.
Henry, you've been at this
for three years.
You're in 300 stores.
$50,000
in the past 12 months.
Don't you think
they should be higher
given the amount of time
you've put into it?
The main problem is
I don't have the capital.
That's why I'm here.
Got it.
HERJAVEC: Tell me about
the business today.
Who's running
this business?
I mean, obviously,
you didn't drop out of school.
But, Henry,
is there a possibility
the reason that none of the big
honey guys have done this
is the market is actually
very small for spiced honey?
We need more, like,
consumer education.
That's what a lot of this
will go towards
because people need to know
what it is.
It's not a sweetener.
It's a condiment.
So, you want me to help educate
America about spices
Do you have
your own website?
MILLER: Yes.
Are you doing any type
of marketing
to drive people
to your website?
I go to food shows
a lot of the time.
My first food show I went to
was national expo west.
O'LEARY: So, Henry,
I look at it this way.
This is a very small category,
so if this takes off,
the big honey guys
can also add spices to honey.
They already have
the shelf space,
Well, I find you
so adorable, Henry.
You're almost irresistible.
I think people are gonna
fall for you,
but Henry has two more chances
to make a deal.
HERJAVEC: Let me tell you
where I'm at.
I mean, gosh, if there's a
business I know a lot about --
Henry, it's your business,
so this is a serious thing.
It's a big thing.
I-if you want to make
a phone call --
MILLER:
I'm not gonna consult my parents
because they told me,
"This is your company.
"Even though it's our money,
you started this thing.
This is your baby."
Look, Henry, I don't want
to sugar-coat this
