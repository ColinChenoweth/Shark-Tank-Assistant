My name is Henry Miller.
I am 16 years old,
and I live on my family farm
in Deming, Washington.
I've learned a lot
about running my business
by being on the farm.
I've built fences,
cleaned up after the animals,
and I feed them.
And sometimes, you just got
to put a little bit
of elbow grease into it.
I really like bees
because they get so much hate
from a lot of people.
Bees all around the world
are suffering from
colony collapse disorder.
Colony collapse disorder
is a mysterious disease
that will infect the hive,
and it's very hard
to find the exact cause.
I started this company
to help save the bees
and my family farm.
My mom calls me
an eco-entrepreneur.
There's nothing
like my product in stores.
I created a new category
for honey to be in
that could change the world.
If we don't get an investment
from the sharks,
I feel that we may lose
our farm.
My mom and dad
have been funneling money
out of their retirement fund
and putting it
into the business,
and I feel like it's my job
to make this business
succeed for them.
CORCORAN:
I hope there's no bees.
[gasps]
Ooh.
Creepy.
Oh, wow.
Hi, sharks.
[laughs]
CUBAN: [laughs]
My name is Henry Miller.
I'm from Deming, Washington,
and I'm seeking $150,000
for a 25% stake of my incredible
company, Henry's Humdingers,
the natural condiment,
honey with a kick.
It all started back
when I was 11 years old,
and I sat next to a beekeeper
on a plane.
And I learned about
colony collapse disorder.
Did you know that if all the
bees died, within seven years,
the whole food chain
would collapse?
The unthinkable would happen.
Mr. Wonderful, you wouldn't be
able to make any more money.
Don't worry.
I speak bee.
[laughter]
Anyhow, I asked my parents for
a beehive for my 12th birthday,
and what do you know?
They got me one.
Next thing you know,
I had so much sweet honey,
I didn't know
what to do with it.
So, I started selling it
on the side of the road.
And I realized
I need to be different.
There's so many people out there
selling sweet honey
that it just needed to change.
And that's how
Henry's Humdingers was born.
And I turned beekeeping
into a business.
And I went from...
[Southern accent]
Henry's Humdingers...
[laughter]
[normal voice]
...To Henry's Humdingers LLC.
I take this ancient thing
like honey,
and I flip it upside down
by adding spices to it.
It's good in meatloaf,
over chicken, ice cream,
and even martinis --
so I've been told.
I brought some samples
for you all to try.
Thanks, Henry.
No problem.
I love the names.
Yep, I currently
have four flavors.
There's Grumpy Grandpa,
Naughty Nana,
Phoebe's Fireball,
and Diabolical Dad.
Henry, the Diabolical Dad
is fantastic.
Naughty Nana is, like --
We've made a cheesecake
out of that.
Wow.
Are there other
flavored honeys out there?
There are other
sweet-flavored honeys,
but I have not encountered
another spicy-flavored honey.
Where are you selling?
What retailers are you
in right now?
Right now, I'm in 300-plus
stores in 34 states,
and I'm in big distributors,
such as unify east.
Wow.
And I was in unify west.
What are your sales?
My sales -- in the past three
years that I've been --
been in business, I had $67,000.
$67,000?
Yeah.
What about
the last 12 months, Henry?
Probably about $50,000, I think.
Henry, you've been at this
for three years.
You're in 300 stores.
$50,000
in the past 12 months.
Don't you think
they should be higher
given the amount of time
you've put into it?
The main problem is
I don't have the capital.
That's why I'm here.
Got it.
HERJAVEC: Tell me about
the business today.
Who's running
this business?
I mean, obviously,
you didn't drop out of school.
My mom and dad are both working
at it while I'm at school.
I make a lot
of the executive decisions.
My mom's working full-time.
She gets paid in love
and teenaged angst.
Did you mention
how much money
your parents
put in the business?
I'm sorry.
I don't think I --
They have put $150,000.
One of my good friends
is the largest honey provider
in Canada.
It's a massive operation.
He's already got
the distribution and so on.
How do you compete
with something like that?
People who have those
large-scale honey things,
they don't want to have to go in
and clean all of our spices out
every time
so they can do
their clean honey run.
So, just so I'm clear,
I can't go to
an existing honey company
and add spices to it.
It would be very expensive.
But, Henry,
is there a possibility
the reason that none of the big
honey guys have done this
is the market is actually
very small for spiced honey?
We need more, like,
consumer education.
That's what a lot of this
will go towards
because people need to know
what it is.
It's not a sweetener.
It's a condiment.
So, you want me to help educate
America about spices
and garlic in honey when maybe
they don't want to know.
See, the thing about Kevin --
He has no concept
of opening up a new category
and creating a new business.
He just wants to be
a vampire
that sucks the money
out of other businesses.
You know, you can say that,
but the truth is,
I think I'm right.
I don't think people want,
in a large scale,
to buy honey with garlic in it
or honey with jalapeño peppers
in it.
Then just go out.
Do you have
your own website?
MILLER: Yes.
Are you doing any type
of marketing
to drive people
to your website?
I go to food shows
a lot of the time.
My first food show I went to
was national expo west.
I went there, and afterwards
Wegmans called me.
Are you in Wegmans?
Yeah, I -- Wegmans has reordered
three times now.
O'LEARY: So, Henry,
I look at it this way.
This is a very small category,
so if this takes off,
the big honey guys
can also add spices to honey.
They already have
the shelf space,
and they'll crush you
like the bee you are.
Unfortunately, for you,
I'm the only shark that tells
the truth all of the time.
You're about to hear everybody
give you lots of encouragement,
but I don't think they're gonna
write you a check for $150,000.
I'm out.
All right. Thank you.
What a nice guy.
What's wrong
with encouragement?
If you're encouraging him
to pursue something
that will never make him money,
you're actually the devil.
[laughs] We all know
where you're from.
Hey, I tell the truth.
I am the angel on his shoulder.
I think it's great
that you are enterprising,
that you are caring about bees
and our ecology.
But my personal opinion is
it's very difficult
to sell something spicy
like this with honey
when I think most people
probably do like
just plain honey.
Mm.
So, my opinion is
this will be a hard --
a hard trek.
I'm not sure I would get
back the $150,000,
and so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you for listening.
Well, I find you
so adorable, Henry.
You're almost irresistible.
I think people are gonna
fall for you,
and I think you shouldn't
get a partner here.
I think you should go
and do some crowdfunding.
You do your pitch online,
you're gonna get all the money
you need.
I'm out because I think
you have a long road,
but I don't think
you need me,
and I don't think
you need anybody here.
Let me tell you
where I'm at.
I mean, gosh, if there's a
business I know a lot about --
I wish you, me, and my friend
could sit in a room
'cause I'm fascinated
by this product.
Robert, before you go out,
let me throw something by you.
NARRATOR:
Three sharks are out,
but Henry has two more chances
to make a deal.
HERJAVEC: Let me tell you
where I'm at.
I mean, gosh, if there's a
business I know a lot about --
I wish you, me, and my friend
could sit in a room
'cause I'm fascinated
by this product.
Robert, before you go out,
let me throw something by you.
Since you know this business,
all right,
what if we upped the amount
and took majority ownership
and took it over
and let him retain equity?
Are you nuts?
All right, what amount?
What if we gave them 300k
for 60%?
And I've never, ever --
in every deal
I've ever done
on "Shark Tank"
even offered
to take a majority.
To me,
that's always a negative.
But in this --
So, why is this different?
This is different because
you're creating a category,
and you need pros
who are going to come in
and fight the battle.
We take that 300k.
That way, you can take the 150k,
pay back your parents.
Mark, why don't you just stick
your head in that beehive?
It's easier.
Yeah.
[laughs]
You know, Kevin,
that's the thing.
That's the difference
between us, Kevin.
I see an idea,
I see an opportunity,
and I can see the endgame
and how it can be enormous.
HERJAVEC: Mark,
it's an interesting angle,
but I don't think your pricing
enough of the risk at 60%.
Let's do the $300,000
for 75%.
Now who's the vampire?
This could be
something big.
$300,000 for 75%.
$150,000 each
from Mark and I.
[sighs]
There's no way
you would consider
anything less
than majority share?
T-the thing about it is
we want the ability to just
take this and run with it.
I get that.
One of the challenges
in "Shark Tank"
is we invest in companies --
at least, that I've learned
over the years,
is when it's family-run,
there's a lot
of unique dynamics.
And it's very difficult
to just say, "Go, go, go,"
which is what you want when
you've just invested $150,000
and you see
the opportunity.
You're still a kid, but
let me tell you something.
When we get this serious
about it, money sees no age.
It's real money.
It's real serious.
Henry, it's your business,
so this is a serious thing.
It's a big thing.
I-if you want to make
a phone call --
MILLER:
I'm not gonna consult my parents
because they told me,
"This is your company.
"Even though it's our money,
you started this thing.
This is your baby."
Look, Henry, I don't want
to sugar-coat this
and try to talk you
into anything.
I want to be brutally honest
on this, right?
Because it's
a new category --
It's really hard
to start new categories.
1,000 nos.
If you want to go into it
and own it
and develop this yourself,
absolutely,
if that's the dream
and that's the goal,
then that's exactly
what you should stick to,
and you should say no.
And so, I don't -- I'm not
here to talk you into it.
I'm here to give you
an alternative.
Henry, $300,000 for 75%
from Mark and I.
What would you like
to do?
If I may, I think I'm going to
consult the bees on this one.
[laughter]
[bees buzzing]
I think they said yes.
There you go.
All right.
HERJAVEC: Very interesting.
Congrats, man.
Oh, thank you.
It'll be awesome.
Well done there.
Thank you so much.
Well thought out.
We'll make it all work.
Yeah.
We'll make it all work.
Thank you.
GREINER: Good luck.
Thank you.
Whoo!
Um, Robert and Mark
both went in,
and they -- they offered
$300,000 for 75%.
To pay my parents back
just means the world to me.
They have just believed in me.
Like, who invests $150,000
into a 12-year-old at the time?
Like, seriously, who does that?
Crazy people.
$150,000 of that 300k
is gonna go straight back
to refunding you guys.
I really think
it's a great deal.
[sniffles]
[crying] Honey.
Was that a pun?
[laughs]
