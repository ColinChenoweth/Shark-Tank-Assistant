Hi, sharks.
I'm Kiowa Grace Kavovit.
And I'm her dad,
Andrew Kavovit,
and we are here seeking
an investment of $100,000...
As well as your relationships
and ideas...
In exchange for 17.5% of
our company, boo boo brands.
So, please check out
this video we made
to help boo boo goo
come to life for you.
As an active 6-year-old,
cuts and scrapes
are just a part of life.
But not all boo-boos
are created equal.
And how am I supposed to
keep doing what kids do
if every little boo-boo
requires this?
[dramatic tones play]
Besides,
those sticky things hurt,
and they always come off
when I want them to stay on.
It's time kids think differently
about the world,
and I'm starting by cleaning up
one little boo-boo at a time.
So, I created this
one-of-a-kind, paint-on bandage.
Now, if I get a small cut
or boo-boo, I just clean it,
dry it, pick my color,
and paint it on.
Huh.
And it's waterproof.
Thanks, Mom.
And for those big nights out,
I choose the skin color to
conceal my boo-boos completely.
Let's go, Daddy.
Bye-bye, boo-boos,
and bye-bye, drama.
So, sharks, as you see,
BooBoo Goo is a playful
and less-intimidating way
to deal with boo-boos.
But make no mistake -- while
our product is kid-friendly...
It's not just for kids.
Our patent-pending formula
was actually developed
by a team of leading
wound-care chemists.
And me and my friends love
that it comes in a bunch
of fun colors and skin tones.
So, you can seal it...
And conceal it.
So, who wants
to come help the world
and clean up one boo-boo
at a time?
Thank you, sharks.
We have some samples here
that Kiowa
would like to hand out.
And if you have any questions,
we'd be happy to answer them.
We made
some special colors.
There's a skin tone
for you, Robert.
Thank you.
We have pink for you,
Lori.
Thank you, Kiowa.
Mr. Wonderful,
your favorite green.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
You did great.
Barbara, we have another
skin tone for you.
Thank you.
And we made a Maverick blue
for you, Mr. Cuban.
How did you come up
with the idea?
I never liked band-aids,
and I didn't want people
ohh.
To see that I had something
'cause look at the board.
There's boo boo goo,
there's the other
paint-on bandage,
and there's the band-aid.
Hmm.
Which one
do you like best?
GREINER:
Great, little sales lady.
Yeah.
Who's your favorite shark,
by the way?
Go ahead.
You can say.
HERJAVEC: All the sharks
are her favorite.
Who? Kevin?
Mr. Wonderful?
I like all of you.
ALL: Ah.
Oh, political.
You saw where she pointed.
She's gonna be
a politician one day.
These are prototypes.
ANDREW: Correct.
Prototype bottles,
if I can clarify.
Prototype bottles.
The formula
is actually finalized.
As I mentioned,
it's been developed
by a leading team
of wound-care chemists.
They broke through
with a completely novel
and unique formulation.
What made it unique?
What was -- what was special
about the formulation?
The most special thing
is our actual sealant.
It's what makes it
waterproof.
Do you have a patent on it?
The patent is pending, um,
and we're gonna continue
to evolve that patent as
they strengthen the technology.
Is it something natural?
It is something natural.
What's left on the skin
at the end of the day
is a completely natural
and organic, pliable,
skin-like,
waterproof barrier.
You have
serious competition.
The major brands make
a spray-on type of product
that's very similar.
Yeah.
It's a liquid bandage.
Yours is colored...
Mm-hmm.
...But I don't think
I'm grasping
what is your
major advantage
or why you would be able
to take over the market?
We think it's very clear
that a person would not want
a scabbed wound showing,
which is all the liquid
bandages service now.
Also, all the liquid-bandages
formulations
on the market currently
are actually flammable.
They're found
in the medical aisle,
not in the band-aid aisle.
So, they have not
crossed over
to any kind
of mainstream market
and certainly haven't tapped
into the 70%
of bandage users,
which is kids
3 to 15 years old.
How are you gonna create
an identity in that market?
With the right partners.
We have interest already
from QVC.
Lori, is this a product
we can sell on QVC?
You know, I don't personally
see this as a QVC product.
O'LEARY: I think the problem
with your deal
that the sharks
have identified,
and I'm certainly
in this camp now,
is for you to get
any significant share in retail,
it's a very, very difficult,
uphill battle.
So, is there an opportunity
to take this
and go
to the majors and say,
"I have a better mouse trap
in the liquid-band-aid space.
"Look at the colors.
It's a better product.
License it from me."
That's exactly
the intention.
Look, this isn't
a small-camp thing.
This is a big product
in a billion-dollar category.
The fact is we need people
like you on the team.
Kiowa, do you know
what earmuffs are?
Do the earmuffs.
CORCORAN: Aw.
Aw, come on, Mark.
GREINER: Aw.
What do you got, Mark?
She can take it.
She can take it?
Okay.
CORCORAN: Come on.
Look, the liquid bandages,
for the most part,
are geared towards adults.
I've got three young kids,
and they're gonna still see
the scab or the wound, right,
and they're still gonna
pick at it, right?
Second, trying
to get this stuff off --
That's exactly the point,
Mark.
You put our product on
in the morning.
You don't reapply it.
There will be no chase
another band-aid down.
There's no falling it off
in the pool
when it's disgusting.
It's still a lot
of high-dollar players
that you're gonna be
competing with.
And you have to go through
the re-education process.
That re-education process
can't just be putting
the product on the shelf.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Fair enough.
Thank you.
First off,
it's very painful for me
to watch you
go down this path.
I don't think there's a need
for this product -- period.
This is band-aids
that kids love picking at.
Whether they do
a good job or not,
parents love sticking them
on the kids' legs.
For those reasons, I'm out.
Andrew, they already have
a liquid bandage.
I think the fact that there's
color to a liquid bandage --
'cause we use them --
is interesting.
But I think, today,
what you haven't proven
is that that's unique enough
to be sold.
And you haven't proven
it'll sell.
Just too early
and not enough data today.
I'm out.
Fair enough.
Thank you, Robert.
I like that you created --
you added the color to it.
I mean, it's inventive.
But I think
there's too much competition.
I hope you do get your patent,
and I wish you good luck.
Without having it,
I feel that you're gonna
really have a struggle.
But you're beautiful, little
daughter is an inventor.
Yeah.
And that's fantastic.
Yeah.
You're thinking of things.
Keep thinking.
You're so young right now
that you could set the world on
fire with more and more ideas.
It only takes one
to become successful.
So, I'm out.
Thank you.
Mr. Wonderful.
Um, I'm stuck on the,
um, distribution strategy
without a patent.
If I really believe the patent
was gonna clear and be issued,
and I could go --
and I'd be good at this --
to a major and license it
to them,
I'd be a great partner for you.
But it's not investable
till you tell me
that you have a patent.
You came here without one.
I like it.
I think it could capture
some share
of the $200 million market.
And that's a growing market,
I think.
It will, and we'll make the
100 grand back on QVC alone.
I actually know
how to defend patents.
I have a lot
of lawyers on stun.
And we believe
it's a licensing deal.
He's a patent troll.
He's a patent troll.
I am.
I'm proud to be one, and
it's what makes America great.
No, it makes --
It's killing us.
We don't agree,
but I'm right as usual.
Killing us.
We believe that this
is a licensing play.
Yeah, no.
We need the leadership
to take it there.
I-I-I get that.
Let's work something out.
All right.
If you want to do a deal
for a contingency
on getting the patent,
I'll invest the $100,000.
I want 25%.
HERJAVEC:
Contingent on the patent.
Contingent
on the patent clearing.
It has to be.
It has to be contingent
on the patent.
That's a reasonable
request.
It's the value that
we're expecting from this.
What do you think?
Yeah?
[laughs]
We appreciate it.
We would love
to take your offer.
You got it.
Wow.
Wow.
Jump down, buddy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
And I'll show you.
All right.
We'll follow through
on this.
Good invention.
Thank you.
Yeah, right?
She's got more coming.
Thanks.
Good job, Kiowa.
You bet.
Thank you, everybody.
Bye-bye.
HERJAVEC: Good job, guys.
Nice meeting you all.
GREINER: Bye.
Good luck.
What do you say, girl?
Good job.
I'm the only shark
that wants to help the children.
Oh, my God.
CORCORAN: Yeah, sure.
KIOWA:
I'm really excited,
and I'm just happy
that we got a deal.
