Hi. My name is Jason, and
I'm the proud owner of iReTron.
Today, I'm seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 20% of my company.
As a social enterprise,
iReTron is an online,
recommerce business
that buys used
or unwanted electronics.
Not only do we offer
the highest price on the market,
but we are also
the greenest place for you
to get rid of your cellphones,
calculators,
MP3 players, and more.
Now, sharks,
I know you guys always want
the biggest, baddest, newest,
smartest smartphones
there is to offer.
However, not everyone
is that case.
In fact me, myself, I don't
even want the newest model.
And thus, iReTron caters to them
by providing older phones
that still have years of life
left in them
to people who can't pay the
full price for their technology.
The best part is it's as easy
as, one, go on our website
and receive an instant quote,
and number two, ship us
your product free of charge.
And finally, 3, get paid
in less than 48 hours.
It's green for the world.
It's green for your wallet.
What do you say, sharks?
Time for you to retron.
Walk me
through an example.
I sell you my old phone.
Right.
Do you fix it up then
and try to sell it
to somebody else?
We'll inspect it
within 48 hours,
then we'll send you a check.
Okay.
So, your part is done.
Do you have a guaranteed buyer
on your end?
Yes.
And that's been proven
because we've been running this
for two years,
and we have zero inventory,
meaning that it never
gets stuck.
All right, selling it
is so much easier
than actually getting
the product,
and that's what we need
to work on.
We need to market
because I haven't spent any
money yet on advertisements.
Jason,
what makes you different
from the other 90 guys
doing this?
Doing the exact same thing.
LI: Right.
Um, so, yes, I am aware that
we do have a lot of competition,
but the one thing
that separates us
is that
we're a social enterprise.
If you look at our website,
we accept over 5,000
different products,
including products
that have literally no value
because, number one,
it's environmentally friendly,
and, number two, it's a simple
way of customer acquisition.
So, you're basically
telling me
you're making less for me
as an investor
because you're buying stuff
that nobody wants,
so that costs me.
You're paying higher prices,
which kills my margins.
Everybody's telling me they're
green because that's for free.
Anybody can say that.
Mm-hmm.
But there's so much competition.
In fact, if you Google this,
there's so many pages,
you'll die of old age
getting to the last.
But if you Google us right now,
if you search, "sell my Kindle,"
we're actually on the first page
of Google.
All right, Jason.
Let's forget what Kevin says.
Let's see what the market says.
What are your sales?
So, in the past 12 months,
we made $40,000.
And I don't want you guys
to get caught up in the numbers
because --
Why not?
Because you have to look
at our growth rate first.
Our first --
$40,000 in this industry
is an absolute-nothing burger.
On that $40,000 that you made
in profit, how much --
LI: $10,000.
So, we have about
a 25% net-profit margin.
Jason,
do you do this full-time?
No. I'm 16 years old.
I'm a senior in high --
Oh, you're only 16?
You're 16?
Wow.
Yeah.
Look at the size of you.
Wow. I thought
you were in college.
I thought you were,
like, 25.
Oh, no, no, no.
CUBAN: Freshman.
Oh, yeah.
You look very mature.
LI: Thank you.
So, I have a question.
Now we have to be
nicer to you.
You're obviously very savvy.
You know what's out there.
What do you think you have
to offer that's better?
Um, well, the one thing
that separates us --
you know, we're not always,
you know, 100% profit-driven.
We care about social,
environment,
and profit all equally.
Jason, what drives you?
Is it
the social responsibility,
or are you -- are you trying
to build a business?
I think there was --
there's a lot of things.
Um, I immigrated to America
when I was 6 years old.
Where'd you come from?
China.
I always wanted to be
independent,
and I always wanted
to contribute
rather than to take for myself.
I like to say that had
two passions in my life.
One is judo,
and the other is iReTron.
And so, with judo, I started
that when I was 5 years old,
and I wasn't half bad, either.
I got to nationals.
That's great.
And I was about to go
to the U.S. Open
until, um, I broke my back.
[gasps] Wow.
And in the month
that I was in bed resting,
I began reading a lot of books,
and one of them was called
"How to Change the World"
by David Bornstein...
Mm.
...In which he talks about
social entrepreneurship
in third-world countries
and how that's really
making a difference.
Jason, I just read
in the "Wall Street Journal"
that something like 85%
of all new businesses
are started by immigrants
or children of immigrants.
I admire how far
you've come at 16
because, my friend, at 16,
I wasn't anywhere near
where you are right now.
Thank you so much.
The business you presented
today -- I'm not seeing it.
And to give you $100,000 --
I just don't think I see
how it's gonna make
the business better.
I wish you all the best,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
Look, when I was 16,
I wasn't doing electronics,
but I was buying
and selling stamps.
I already knew
what I could sell it for...
Mm-hmm.
...So I could flip it
very quickly.
Exactly what this is.
That's exactly
what this is.
Right.
But the point is right now
you're forced to hustle.
Everything is,
"I've got to go out there
and figure out how to pay for it
before I do it."
Uh-huh.
Right?
Introducing that much capital
into a business,
it gives you a comfort level
that you shouldn't have,
particularly while
you're still in school.
I mean,
I love what you're doing,
but it scares me
that the money would take you
in a different direction.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Well, thank you very much
for your time.
And really, part of this
is all about inspiring
the next generation.
[chuckling] Jason, you got
to deal with your generation
Before you worry
about the next generation.
Exactly.
No, and that's the thing.
I was thinking, "You know what?
"Next generation,
next generation --
that's my generation."
So, it's up to me
to make a solution.
And it's up to me
to inspire all of my friends
and all of my peers.
Jason, you valued this
at $500,000, okay?
Yes.
So, one test that you should
always do in your own mind
before you come in front
of an investor like me is,
"Could I do this myself
and own 100% of it
for a lot less than $500,000?"
Because there's nothing
proprietary
about what you're doing.
So, you've failed that test,
and, for that reason, I'm out.
All right, well, thank you
very much for your time.
CORCORAN: Hallelujah,
I can speak. Okay.
I'm not sure about this
business, all right?
I don't know if it's gonna win
or it's gonna lose.
So, it's a big question Mark,
quite honestly, in my head.
But what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna offer you $100,000
for the 20% in your business
for one reason only.
I feel like
you're a winner.
I don't know what form
that winning's gonna take,
all right, but it comes
with a big contingency.
The contingency is --
well, twofold --
one, you're gonna get the money
on an as-needed basis
'cause you're only 16.
[laughs]
You talk like you're 30,
but you're only 16.
The other contingency is
I want to have 20% of any
business you think about
and start
over the next five years.
That is the kind of greed
that just disgusts me.
I'm putting a big, blank
check in on you,
which makes no sense,
but I can't help but to feel
you are a winner.
Wow.
Thank you. Um...
Well,
I think you're great.
I love what you're doing
because you're
a young entrepreneur.
I think that Barbara
has offered you a deal,
and it's a lot better
than what I would have offered,
so, for that reason,
I'll go out.
All right.
Well, thank you very much
for your time.
So, Barbara, I love your offer,
but if I can address Mark?
No problem at all.
Thank you.
She knows I'm not gonna try
to steal off that.
Thank you very much.
And so, Mark, look, honestly,
I'm not gonna stop hustling.
I've been working on this
for the past two years,
and I'm reaching a level
where I-I can't do any more
than what I can right now,
as in, like, I don't have
the ability or the knowledge.
And I really love the both of
you, and I would really love it
if both of you can -- you know,
if I could work
with both of you.
Would you guys like to come in
on this together?
I'll tell you this.
I'll tell you.
You do this deal
with Barbara.
I'll be a partner
with Barbara in it.
I-I'll split it.
I'll split it with you.
Yeah, I'll take money
from you. Why not?
You'll split it?
Yeah.
Um, let's do work.
Hey.
There you go.
"Let's do work."
I like it.
HERJAVEC: Wow.
You're gonna make me
do work.
GREINER: Good one.
Congratulations, Jason, man.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
You made yourself
a good deal.
Thank you.
Nicely done.
[laughs]
Jason, you just proved
the American dream
is alive and well.
I'm trying to -- doing my best.
Good luck.
I like that.
"Doing work."
Thank you.
I could use your help.
I can't believe I just
shook hands with Mark Cuban.
I can't believe I just --
oh, yeah.

is a 6-year-old
with a product she invented
with some help from her dad.
