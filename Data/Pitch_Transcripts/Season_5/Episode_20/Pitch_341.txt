Hi. My name is Jason, and
I'm the proud owner of iReTron.
Today, I'm seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 20% of my company.
As a social enterprise,
iReTron is an online,
recommerce business
that buys used
or unwanted electronics.
Not only do we offer
the highest price on the market,
but we are also
the greenest place for you
to get rid of your cellphones,
calculators,
Jason,
what makes you different
from the other 90 guys
doing this?
Doing the exact same thing.
LI: Right.
Um, so, yes, I am aware that
we do have a lot of competition,
but the one thing
that separates us
is that
we're a social enterprise.
If you look at our website,
we accept over 5,000
different products,
including products
that have literally no value
because, number one,
it's environmentally friendly,
All right, Jason.
Let's forget what Kevin says.
Let's see what the market says.
What are your sales?
So, in the past 12 months,
we made $40,000.
Jason,
do you do this full-time?
No. I'm 16 years old.
I'm a senior in high --
Oh, you're only 16?
You're 16?
Wow.
Yeah.
Look at the size of you.
Wow. I thought
you were in college.
I thought you were,
like, 25.
Oh, no, no, no.
CUBAN: Freshman.
Oh, yeah.
You look very mature.
LI: Thank you.
So, I have a question.
Now we have to be
nicer to you.
You're obviously very savvy.
You know what's out there.
What do you think you have
to offer that's better?
Um, well, the one thing
that separates us --
you know, we're not always,
you know, 100% profit-driven.
We care about social,
environment,
Jason, what drives you?
Is it
the social responsibility,
or are you -- are you trying
to build a business?
I think there was --
there's a lot of things.
Um, I immigrated to America
when I was 6 years old.
Where'd you come from?
China.
I always wanted to be
independent,
Jason, I just read
in the "Wall Street Journal"
that something like 85%
of all new businesses
are started by immigrants
or children of immigrants.
I admire how far
you've come at 16
because, my friend, at 16,
I wasn't anywhere near
where you are right now.
Thank you so much.
The business you presented
today -- I'm not seeing it.
[chuckling] Jason, you got
to deal with your generation
Before you worry
about the next generation.
Jason, you valued this
at $500,000, okay?
Yes.
So, one test that you should
always do in your own mind
before you come in front
of an investor like me is,
"Could I do this myself
GREINER: Good one.
Congratulations, Jason, man.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
You made yourself
a good deal.
Thank you.
Nicely done.
[laughs]
Jason, you just proved
the American dream
