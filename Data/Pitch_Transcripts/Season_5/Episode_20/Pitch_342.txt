Hello, sharks.
My name is Carter Kostler.
I'm from Virginia Beach,
Virginia,
and my company
is the Define Bottle.
Today, I'm seeking $100,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.
There is an epidemic of soda
in our refrigerators.
Everyone knows these
sugary drinks are bad for you,
yet the average American
continues to drink
one or two cans a day.
You should be grabbing a water,
but plain water
is just so boring.
If only there were
a simple and healthy way
to make water more exciting.
Oh, that's right, there is.
Introducing my product,
the Define Bottle,
a simple and beautiful way
to take fresh,
fruit-infused water to go.
Let me show you how it works.
First thing you're gonna do
is chop up
your freshly sliced fruit
of your choice.
Place it in the bottom chamber,
where there is a refreezable
base piece
that helps keep your fruit cool.
Add your strainer piece and your
top chamber and fill with water.
Notice, when I fill
the Define Bottle up with water,
the water goes down
into the bottom,
but the fruit does not rise
to the mouthpiece.
Add your lid, pop your top,
and you're ready to go.
After about 15 minutes,
the water will be infused
by the fruit,
adding a refreshing hint
of flavor.
Clever.
Now, sharks, I have
a Define Bottle
for each of you
filled
with your favorite fruit.
Okay.
There you go, Robert.
Thanks, Carter.
No problem.
And then, Kevin,
we got Mango.
Yes.
It's your favorite.
You didn't have any
with garlic?
Garlic?
For this guy.
CUBAN:
Garlic kills vampires.
Oh, wow,
that's great, Carter.
KOSTLER:
Congratulations.
You are doing something
to improve your health.
I may be young, but that does
not hold be back from knowing
that I can make a difference
in this world.
Now I'm looking for a partner
to help me transform
the way people hydrate.
So, sharks,
who wants to help the world
define what they drink?
So, Carter,
how young are you?
I am 15.
What?
15?!
Are you kidding?
You look at least 16.
CUBAN: You look a whole lot
older than 15, Carter.
Really? Well, thank you.
Absolutely.
Oh, my gosh.
Did you create this yourself?
Yeah, I created it
when I was 13 years old.
The story is my mom
got really into the whole
fruit-infused-water scene.
But whenever my mom
left the house,
she always grabbed soda
or a juice.
So, I wanted my mom
to enjoy those fresh,
fruit-infused water recipes
when she left the house.
So, I did some sketches
on a little legal pad,
and I pitched the idea
to my parents.
What are your sales?
We have done $65,000 in sales
since may 15th.
Wow.
In 4 months, $65,000?
Yes.
And was that at wholesale
or at retail?
Well, 50% of our sales
have been online.
50% have been wholesale.
We sold them on our website,
and we have retail accounts.
Who do you have
as retailers?
Whole Foods,
Davids Teas in Canada.
Carter, how did
Davids Tea find you?
How did Whole Foods
find you?
I cold-called companies,
so I walked into Whole Foods --
Like, right at the store?
Literally, right at the store --
walked in, said, "Hey, can I
speak to the produce manager?"
Shake his hand, looked him
in the eye, and I say,
"Sir, this product is gonna be
excellent at Whole Foods."
Love the hustle,
my friend.
Thank you.
We got invited to the whole
foods farmers' market,
and we did $1,000 worth
of bottles in 3 hours.
Tell me about
the Davids Tea order.
Is that a firm order?
Yes, we did a order of 165
bottles, and they all sold out.
They loved it.
Okay, and do -- do you have
a reorder from them?
We don't have a reorder yet.
Why?
It's -- it's too early, I think.
Why?
Carter, let me go back
for a second.
What do you sell it for
at retail,
and what does it
cost you?
The retail price
for that bottle is $30,
and it costs,
to get to our door, $10.
But we're currently talking
to a manufacturer over in China,
and they have guaranteed us
they can get the price
of this bottle down to $5.
CUBAN:
What about online?
Where's your traffic coming
from online?
Right, yeah, absolutely.
Well, early on,
I created fruit-infused-water
recipe websites.
And my goal was to promote the
Define Bottle on those sites.
Okay. What kind of traffic
are you getting,
what kind of conversion
are you getting,
and what do you know
about your customers?
Okay, well, we currently get
2,000 hits a day on those sites.
Okay.
And our conversion rate,
I think it's 0.5.
Why do you think your
conversion rate's so low?
You know, I don't know.
I have a question, Mark,
that might answer some of this.
Yes.
Are you aware of your
competition out there?
Yes.
Our biggest competitor,
they're currently selling
in Brookstone.
It's big. It's bulky.
It's stainless steel.
You can't see the fruit like
in the Define Bottle you can.
And it has little razor blades
on the bottom
that require you to mash up
and grind up your fruit.
The problem is, while it's
very nice and it works well,
there's a ton of competition
out in the space right now
with this exact same
kind of thing.
And they're a lot
less expensive,
but I think
they also work well.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
How much have you spent
developing it?
$300,000.
Wow.
You've got to be kidding.
My parents have taken out
a mortgage on the house.
D'oh.
Wow. This is a big bet
you guys have made.
I think your product's
so darn pretty,
I want to own one.
But $300,000 for your parents
blows my mind.
Carter, I think you spent
way too much money
developing this.
I'd never get my money back.
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
O'LEARY:
So, there's a tremendous amount
of competition.
And in my view,
it's not investable.
For that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
Two sharks left on either end.
HERJAVEC: Carter,
here's where I'm at.
This is a beautiful,
beautiful design.
You've got
some great retailers.
So, that's all good news.
Here's the bad news.
You're into a retailer
that gave you a great order,
and they didn't reorder.
And you don't know why.
But I like the product.
Thank you.
We need to do
some research,
but I'm willing
to make you an offer.
NARRATOR:
Three sharks are out,
but Robert is willing
to take a chance.
I'm willing
to make you an offer.
I'll give you the $100,000
that you're looking for,
but because there's risk,
I want 40% of the business.
Okay.
Um...Robert, thank you
so much for your offer.
Uh, would you mind
if I go in the hallway
and talk to my parents?
Well,
there's another shark.
Don't you want to hear what --
No, go ahead. no, go ahead.
Talk to your parents.
Don't you want to find out
what Mr. Cuban's doing?
No, I want him to talk
to his parents first.
[laughs]
Okay, thank you.
Lori, Barbara...
Uh-huh.
...And Kevin are out.
Robert is asking for 40%.
Have you told them
what assets you have yet?
No, I have not.
It didn't come up yet.
Should he ask more
to help us out?
Oh, well, then,
you need to do that.
That's my opinion that you need
to go back and say...
They didn't ask.
..."Here's what my --
and here's what
the company is worth."
Mark,
what are you thinking?
At 15,
when I had my businesses,
I could walk into anywhere.
No one's gonna say no.
Everybody's always gonna
give you a chance.
Right, no one's gonna be
mean to a kid.
So, there's a balance between
what's real and sustainable
by the product itself
and what's just the carry
of him being a kid.
But I don't know that.
But that said,
it's a cool product.
Carter, welcome back.
So, the offer was $100,000
for 40%.
Right. My parents and I
discussed it out there,
and we think that our company is
worth a little more than that.
We -- we have assets.
We have $85,000 in tooling,
150 grand in inventory.
We have sales of $65,000
since May 15th,
projected sales of $200,000
this year,
$400,000 in sales next year.
Carter, what do you think
it's worth?
Uh, $500,000.
So, you are not going to take
his offer of $100,000 for 40%.
That's what I hear.
Well, Robert, would you
be willing to do 30%?
It's like I said.
We have assets.
Carter, the assets
are only worth something
if the company
is successful.
It's not like
if you stumble,
we can sell the assets
for something else.
I appreciate
where you're coming from,
but I'm not gonna take
your counteroffer
because I think there's
a tremendous amount of risk
that all the other sharks
have brought up.
I can't get to the valuation
that you have
and marry it
against that risk.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I'm trying to find reasons
to say yes, Carter.
But the fact
that your parents
took out a mortgage
to support this --
that just puts so much stress
on the whole thing,
and you didn't give me enough
depth on your competition
to have any type
of confidence
that the competition
isn't just going
to dominate this market.
And for that reason,
I have to say I'm out.
Okay.
You did a great job in here,
though, presenting yourself.
Thank you.
We treated you just like we did
anybody at any age.
You should be
very proud of that.
Thank you all so much.
Good luck, Carter.
I think it's remarkable
that he was 15 years old.
Remarkable.
Hey.
MOM: How'd it go?
Not well.
We didn't get a deal.
KOSTLER: You know,
the future is very bright.
Our sales are going up and up,
and even though this might be
a little setback,
we're just gonna move on
and keep rolling.
NARRATOR: Last season,
we saw 11-year-old Ryan Kelly
and his mom, Daniela,
make a deal with Barbara
for his homemade-dog-treats
company, Ryan's Barkery.
Have you sold
any of these?
We've sold
about 200 bags of them.
I'd love to make you
a full-price offer.
We have a deal.
Aah!
Yeah, there you go!
MAN: All right.
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.
RYAN: Barbara really made
a lot of things happen
for Ryan's Barkery.
She helped us get
into stew Leonard's,
and it feels like a dream.
Hey, everybody!
Ryan!
Hi!
CORCORAN: Stew Leonard's is
a landmark in the local area,
and most importantly,
they have customers.
And that's why we're here.
You want pumpkin-apple?
I feel super-excited
about my business.
I have a new logo and a great,
new, professional packaging.
And it looks amazing.
Before "Shark Tank,"
I made about $900,
and in 5 months,
I've made over $70,000.
So, first,
you need a shirt.
Ryan has a new sales strategy.
Go start selling.
He's recruiting other kids
to sell his dog biscuits
in their local town,
their local neighborhood,
and to their lacrosse team.
Ha!
[whistle blows]
Who's got a dog?
You got a dog?
You got a dog?
You want to see a picture?
No, we want to sell you
some dog food.
Oh.
Watching Ryan go through
this "Shark Tank" experience --
it's been wonderful
to watch him grow into
what he's really capable of.
So, how much
did we make?
ALL: $1,019.
Oh, my!
I feel that Barbara
invested in me
because she sees a lot
of potential in the business.
And I think she's right.
NARRATOR:
Next up is a student
who hopes to save the planet
from electronic waste.
