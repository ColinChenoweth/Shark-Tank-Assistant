Hello, sharks.
My name is Carter Kostler.
I'm from Virginia Beach,
Virginia,
Thanks, Carter.
No problem.
Oh, wow,
that's great, Carter.
KOSTLER:
Congratulations.
You are doing something
to improve your health.
I may be young, but that does
not hold be back from knowing
that I can make a difference
in this world.
Now I'm looking for a partner
to help me transform
the way people hydrate.
So, sharks,
who wants to help the world
define what they drink?
So, Carter,
how young are you?
I am 15.
What?
15?!
Are you kidding?
You look at least 16.
CUBAN: You look a whole lot
older than 15, Carter.
Really? Well, thank you.
Absolutely.
Oh, my gosh.
Did you create this yourself?
Yeah, I created it
when I was 13 years old.
The story is my mom
got really into the whole
fruit-infused-water scene.
But whenever my mom
left the house,
she always grabbed soda
or a juice.
So, I wanted my mom
to enjoy those fresh,
fruit-infused water recipes
when she left the house.
So, I did some sketches
on a little legal pad,
Carter, how did
Davids Tea find you?
How did Whole Foods
find you?
I cold-called companies,
so I walked into Whole Foods --
Like, right at the store?
Literally, right at the store --
walked in, said, "Hey, can I
speak to the produce manager?"
Carter, let me go back
for a second.
What do you sell it for
at retail,
Carter, I think you spent
way too much money
developing this.
I'd never get my money back.
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
O'LEARY:
So, there's a tremendous amount
of competition.
HERJAVEC: Carter,
here's where I'm at.
This is a beautiful,
beautiful design.
You've got
some great retailers.
So, that's all good news.
Here's the bad news.
You're into a retailer
that gave you a great order,
Carter, welcome back.
So, the offer was $100,000
for 40%.
Carter, what do you think
it's worth?
Uh, $500,000.
So, you are not going to take
his offer of $100,000 for 40%.
That's what I hear.
Well, Robert, would you
be willing to do 30%?
It's like I said.
We have assets.
Carter, the assets
are only worth something
if the company
is successful.
It's not like
if you stumble,
we can sell the assets
for something else.
I appreciate
where you're coming from,
but I'm not gonna take
your counteroffer
because I think there's
a tremendous amount of risk
that all the other sharks
have brought up.
I can't get to the valuation
that you have
I'm trying to find reasons
to say yes, Carter.
But the fact
that your parents
took out a mortgage
to support this --
that just puts so much stress
on the whole thing,
Thank you all so much.
Good luck, Carter.
I think it's remarkable
that he was 15 years old.
Remarkable.
Hey.
MOM: How'd it go?
Not well.
We didn't get a deal.
KOSTLER: You know,
the future is very bright.
