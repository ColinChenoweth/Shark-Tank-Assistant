Hey, sharks.
My name is Kasey gandham.
And I'm Mike Shannon.
We're from Chicago,
Illinois,
and our company
is packback books.
We're seeking $200,000
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Sharks, let me ask
you all a question.
Do you remember what it was like
to be a college student?
Well, sharks, there's been
a serious epidemic on the rise
since your college days,
and it's the cost of textbooks.
Hey, Mark, did you know
that since the time when you
hung up your Hoosier hat,
textbook prices
have risen 812%?
In fact, the students
are even dropping out
of their courses
in order to avoid
the book cost.
They are compromising
their education.
But that's not the worst
that can happen.
Take a look at this.
When you buy textbooks
  from the book store,
you end up broke.
[ groans ]
when you end up broke,
  you have to get a job
cleaning windows
  on campus.
When you clean windows
  on campus, you look in and see
parts of your professor
  you wish you hadn't.
  huh? aah!
When you see things
  you wish you hadn't, you
  fall off a 10-story building.
[ groans ]
  when you fall off
  a 10-story building,
You wind up
  in a full-body cast
and can't lug
  your expensive books to class.
When you can't lug
  your expensive books to class,
you sadly flunk
  out of college.
  oh, no!
And when you flunk
  out of college,
you end up back in
  your mom's basement...
Hi!
  ...Eating cookies
  on the couch in a onesie.
[ groans ]
  don't end up eating cookies
  on the couch in a onesie.
Use packback books.
Clever.
SHANNON:
Packback books is a website
offering pay-per-use access
to digital textbooks.
A student simply logs in,
selects the book they need,
and bam, they have
immediate, affordable
access to their books.
Our e-textbooks
are fully equipped
with highlighting
and note-taking capabilities,
and we're already working with
major U.S. textbook publishers
to bring the packback service
to students nationwide.
Sharks, who's ready to pack
smart with packback books?
O'LEARY: You're walking
right into my space here.
Let's say
I'm Houghton Mifflin,
and I'm doing curriculum books
for the New York Market.
I already offer them
in a digital format.
Are you saying you're
just letting me lease
the digital format?
Absolutely.
So, the way
our service works --
let's say Daymond is
a sophomore in college.
He's fed up. Freshman year,
he spent $1,200 on new books.
He realized he didn't use
half of them
enough for
the purchase price.
We allow Daymond to hold off
on buying anything.
Rent for a day at a time
at $5 or less,
as is a quiz
or a homework assignment.
So, Mike,
I'm going to assume that,
if you're in this business,
you have a deal
with the largest publishers
in that space.
that's right.
We have a deal with one
of the biggest four.
One of the largest.
What percentage of the books
would that cover?
So, it's roughly anywhere
from 25% to 30%,
depending on your --
on your average campus.
And if it works,
you'll get the other ones.
Right, so --
but why wouldn't one
of the big guys just do this?
It's their -- it's their
property you're renting
out anyway.
Yes. E-textbooks
are being sold.
They've been around
in the Marketplace for
around eight years, but --
HERJAVEC:
But they're only being sold.
They're being rented
for a semester
at approximately
$100 to $150 per book. now --
but you're doing it
differently --
the only difference being
you're doing it by the day.
We're introducing
a micro-transaction into this --
you're -- you're pay-per-view.
Yeah, we're pay-per--
pay-per-use.
Yeah, so --
what's a typical price
for a textbook?
Your new book
could be $150.
All right.
A used book could be
as low as $89.
So, semester's starting.
In your format, how much
is it gonna cost me?
We rent digital books
for $5 a day.
What's the average amount of
days that a student downloads?
What we found was that --
we're in a closed beta
with 330 students at one campus.
They're using their books only
on four main occasions.
We're seeing the -- the revenue
on an average student
that -- that packbacks --
for our portion of the share --
$34 per semester.
Tell me your cost
to the publisher.
So, the publishers receive
75% of revenue.
Ouch.
CORCORAN: Yeah.
SHANNON:
So -- and this is --
that's the deal
you've negotiated right now?
75%?
GANDHAM: This is -- so, this is
a standard industry --
industry licensing agreement
for all e-books.
So we think we --
you know,
we might be able to get
up to 30% on our end.
You don't -- y-you have
no exclusivity
with any of these publishers,
right?
'cause I've worked with these
guys for over a decade, okay?
They don't give exclusivity.
That's correct.
Right, so we --
we absolutely know
that there's
a first-mover advantage
to be taken advantage of
right here.
The major players
in this space,
they're all selling
used books.
But the textbook industry
is an $8 billion industry.
$6 billion of that
are used books.
Everyone's buying a used --
but what's that got to do
with your Market?
Because if -- if --
if an Amazon or a chegg
were to offer
daily e-textbook rentals,
they'd be directly cannibalizing
their used books.
They're in so much trouble
because this used-book Market
is -- is such a disaster
for their revenue.
What percentage
of the student population
are actually renting
their books
versus buying them
in the first place?
The average student
will spend about $500
a semester
on used books.
Okay, so now he's gonna rent
on a typical --
at least.
The publisher didn't
get a dime of that
money, of those dollars.
Okay, but he's now gonna
rent from you instead on
a daily basis?
Correct.
So, what does that
come out to?
In one year, he's going
to spend about $280.
Oh.
So it's a great savings?
It's an amazing savings.
I don't know
if it's a great saving.
My son, he looks at his textbook
a lot more than four times.
I mean, that's four days
in an entire semester?
What we found in our research,
it doesn't --
are you telling me my kids are
only looking at their textbooks,
on average,
four times a semester?
Robert, it's not because
they're not studying.
It's because the professors
have a wealth of resources
to put out
the necessary information.
The book is
one more resource.
It's not the --
the end-all, be-all.
Kasey and Mike,
this is -- this --
so, Mike,
your entire pitch is,
to the publisher,
"I'm giving you revenue
that you're not getting"?
correct.
Wow. So, guys, this is
the beauty about "Shark Tank."
all the sharks have so much
knowledge in different spaces.
I got to this place
in my life
by having drive
and common sense.
But, tell you the truth,
I didn't go to college,
and I'm dyslexic,
so I can barely read.
I like to invest
in businesses
that I have some expertise in
so I can help them grow.
I don't have any knowledge
in this business, so I'm out.
We appreciate it --
appreciate it, Daymond.
Okay, thank you very much
for your time.
You know what I think?
I think you're having
a much harder time
selling this thing
than you're telling us.
I admire your persistence,
but I think you're gonna have
a heck of a hard time,
and I can't imagine
all the publishers
going along for the ride.
Perhaps I'm being negative,
but I'm out.
So, that kind of plays
into --
I'm out.
You're out? Thank you
very much for your time.
Thanks, Barbara.
We appreciate it.
Guys, I like
what you're doing, okay?
I-i know your --
your industry inside out.
I have personally
negotiated deals
with all of those publishers
for over a decade.
I will give you one small piece
of advice.
It'll take you a lot longer
than you think to get the deals.
Oh, we know.
Okay.
We spent two years as students
going through this ourselves.
And -- and -- it -- well,
it sends a tingle up my spine
to get back
into the education Market,
which is where I made
the bulk of my net worth.
Sure.
I can't go back there.
If I walk
into those offices again,
I'd rip the rest
of my hair out.
Redbox and Netflix,
they -- they weren't --
and iTunes -- they weren't
overnight successes.
It's important
that you're young,
'cause by the time you finish
with the educational publishers,
you will be very old, okay?
Right. But --
and -- and I'm not saying it's
not a noble pursuit.
I have spent thousands of hours
in their offices.
You will have no hair.
You will both look like me
when this is over.
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
I am out.
Thanks, Kevin.
Thank you very much.
Guys --
um, here's what
we think it takes.
It takes
the right context.
When we find
the right individuals
within the organization,
things click.
HERJAVEC: Mike, look.
I guess it comes down to --
you know, everything's
a gut feel, right?
Everything -- everything you
invest in in life is a gut feel.
I just don't share
your vision for this product.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thanks, Robert.
Thank you -- thank you
very much for the time.
Who's left? Mark?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I like the concept.
I mean, I'm already
in tech Ed --
degreed, ranku,
copley systems, hourlynerd.
I mean, I'm -- I'm in a bunch,
so I get the space, right?
But 10% isn't enough.
And I want you guys
to come back to me
and tell me what's
the most equity I can get,
how, and how much.
Right. Um...
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.
Mark is interested,
but he's not happy
with the amount of equity
being offered.
CUBAN: Okay.
I like the concept.
But 10% isn't enough.
And I want you guys
to come back to me
and tell me what's
the most equity I can get,
how, and how much.
Right. Um...
You can talk.
Talk?
Let's go talk about it.
What if we just ask him
for more?
Ask him for more money
and offer, uh...
15% for $300,000?
That's the same valuation.
Yeah. It'd be the same.
Look, if you look at it
as pay-per-view for text,
then the fact that it --
that it's textbooks now...
CORCORAN: Mm-hmm.
...That's just a start.
In near-term, negotiating those,
uh, publisher agreements
is gonna take
a long time.
Yeah, I think they
can get past that
because they don't have to be
completely dependent,
just pay-per-view.
yeah.
Mark, we agree
with what you're saying.
We really value you
as an investor.
We want you to be very much
vested into packback's growth.
We would like to offer you
17.5% for $200,000.
What about $250,000
for 20%?
Would you do --
would you be ab--
willing to do
$200,000 for the 20%?
What?!
Yes.
No. No. That's not --
[ laughter ]
no, you're --
no, that's not --
no, we're thinking.
we're thinking.
We're thinking. No, no.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
I-i-i meant -- yeah.
No, no, he --
he did it wrong.
Are you sure you want to be
in a deal with these guys?
Let's hit
the rewind button on that.
Yeah, so, we --
we would AC--
we'll accept your deal.
We would like to accept
your deal, Mark.
250-- I'll cut you guys
a break.
$250,000 for 20% equity.
For 20%. There you go. Yes.
[ laughter ]
Thanks, Mark.
Appreciate it.
All right, that was --
all right.
congrats, guys. it'll be fun.
all right.
You guys wouldn't have
been best friends anymore
after that one.
[ laughter ]
It's all right.
Thank you, guys.
JOHN: Congratulations.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
What I actually meant
to say was
we were hoping to get
$250,000 at the 17.5%.
I may, uh...
[ laughs ]
I'm, uh -- I'm a sharp kid.
I can do math.
But, uh, when you're
in the tank,
it's -- it's not
that easy, right?
Yeah, that was
a code red.
