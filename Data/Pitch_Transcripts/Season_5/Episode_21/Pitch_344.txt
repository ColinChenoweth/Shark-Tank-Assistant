My name is Pat Crowley.
I live in beautiful
Salt Lake city, Utah.
Hello. Chapul.
This is Pat speaking.
My name is Pat Crowley,
from Salt Lake city, Utah.
My company is Chapul,
Pat, what does this
replace?
CROWLEY: Absolutely.
They're considered lucky.
Absolutely.
For example, in China,
people think
it's incredibly unlucky to kill
one, even accidentally.
How do you know that?
[ laughter ]
Listen, I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I know everything.
It's considered
really bad karma
to kill them,
let alone freeze them.
You got a whole bunch
of crickets right here.
They're not chirping
'cause they sense danger.
I agree. I agree.
That's what they sense.
You -- they know they're gonna
die a horrible death with you.
I just think, in this case,
those crickets are telling me
to stay out of this deal.
I'm out.
talk money. talk money.
we're negotiating numbers.
CROWLEY:
All right, all right.
You want me to come back
with another offer?
Yeah.
You got to make it
cricket sweet for him.
Make me an offer.
All right, so, i-i know
what it takes to lead a team,
Pat, I'll give you
the $50,000 for 20%.
Ooh, somebody
jumped back in.
I'll do it
for the 15%.
15%?
Yep.
Let's do this.
Let's do this, Mark.
Let's go make
some chirping money.
Appreciate it, buddy.
Thank you very much.
He snatched that one
from you.
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
CUBAN:
Let's eat some crickets.
yeah, let's eat
some crickets.
Good job, man.
Thank you very much.
Robert, here's
your consolation prize.
Oh, don't come near me.
[ laughter ]
oh, my God.
CROWLEY: I definitely gave away
more equity than I wanted,
but now that Mark
is one of our partners,
we can't be more excited to just
take this to the next level
Well, that patent's long
expired. That was back in 1979.
Were you broken in?
Is this how you invented --
that's how I came up --
yeah.
I was living in a condominium
where there were, uh --
the garages were separate
from the residence.
not including
the patent money.
O'LEARY:
You're a -- you've built a
better mousetrap. Get that.
Now, I don't know
how to sell it
