My name is Pat Crowley.
I live in beautiful
Salt Lake city, Utah.
And I'm the founder
of Chapul.
[ dog barks ]
As an environmentalist,
I'm very concerned about
the future of our planet.
And so that's what inspired me
to create
an eco-friendly energy bar.
Right now we work
in a very small kitchen,
and we make all the bars
by hand.
Our product is the first
of its kind in the world.
It contains an extremely
healthy, sustainable form
of protein
that we like to refer to
as our secret ingredient.
Hello. Chapul.
This is Pat speaking.
We're growing every month, and
we can't keep up with demand.
We need an investment
from the sharks
to increase our production
and get the word out
about our amazing product.
Yeah, stoked on the new design.
It looks good.
Starting Chapul
has been a challenge.
People have called us crazy
and said that the idea
would never work.
Wanting a deal today
goes well beyond my desire
for personal success.
I want to propel this protein
as the food of the future.
My name is Pat Crowley,
from Salt Lake city, Utah.
My company is Chapul,
and I'm asking $50,000
in exchange for 5% equity
in our company.
At Chapul, we're changing
the way people think about food,
and we do it
with an energy bar.
But what separates us from
the thousands of competitors
isn't the delicious
medjool dates
or the organic dark chocolate.
No, it's our sustainable,
eco-friendly form of protein
that goes
into every single bar.
I'll show you,
but first, a joke.
[ laughter ]
Why are frogs so happy?
Uh-oh. Why?
Why?
Because they eat
what bugs them.
[ laughter ]
And now, so can you
with Chapul cricket bars.
Oh, you got
to be kidding.
Crickets are an extremely
sustainable form of protein.
They go into each one
of our bars.
Ohh.
I-insects are eaten in over half
the countries around the globe,
and we think that it's
about time that Americans
catch up
with the rest of the world.
There is no way
I'm eating that.
[ laughter ]
All right, we have
a thailand-themed
coconut ginger lime.
T-this one?
Yep.
Aztec bar is dark chocolate
coffee cayenne.
And then we have an all-american
peanut butter and chocolate.
Why not? Right?
HERJAVEC: They're crickets,
not cockroaches.
Correct.
We actually make a flour
out of the crickets...
Thank you.
...So you won't see
any legs or antennae.
[ laughter ]
You first.
Must we eat it?
Sure.
You're obviously jumping
at the opportunity here
to get on board
with a growing global business.
So, who wants to join Chapul
and help us to feed
the revolution?
You realize that there's
a huge barrier...
Absolutely.
...Around this product.
Absolutely.
Some very large percentage
of consumers
are going to be revolted
because in our north
American society, they
don't eat insects.
I'm not saying it's good or bad.
They just don't.
I agree.
So, what I'm trying
to determine,
because I'm trying
to be pragmatic --
I'm happy to invest in it
if I can make money.
Sure. So, we modeled our energy
bar after the sushi industry.
30 years ago,
eating raw fish was completely
repulsive to Americans,
and -- until a man by the name
of ichiro mashita
craftily developed
the California roll,
and it was
a gentle introduction.
And so, that's what we're doing
with our ener--
but that took 20 years.
CUBAN: Tell --
talk about sales.
Okay, so, we -- to date,
we have, uh, $50,000 in sales,
and this year,
we're averaging
33% increase
month over month revenue.
So, over what period of time
would you say $50,000?
Oh. That's in
just under a year.
Where are you in retail?
Natural-foods stores,
bike shops,
rock-climbing gyms,
crossfit gyms.
You're saying it's worth
a million dollars?
Absolutely.
Well, why can't I
just get my own crickets
and make my own bars?
[ laughter ]
W-we've spent a lot of time
developing the supply chain
and working with the FDA,
and we're the only ones
right now
with an insect-based nutritional
product on the Market.
Only one that can sell
cricket bars?
We're the only ones doing it.
And one bar -- what do you
sell it for?
$2.99.
And to make it?
It costs about a dollar.
Where do you get
your crickets?
Do you grow them yourself?
You catch them?
We work with -- we work with
a cricket ranch, actually.
[ laughter ]
And do you -- do you --
They have --
they have little lassos.
Little cricket brands.
Where is there
a cricket ranch?
We've been raising crickets
in the -- in the United States
for over 100 years,
and it was based on --
why?
Fishing bait,
then it was reptile feed,
and now that was one of
the reasons we chose crickets,
is because the infrastructure
is already in place
to grow them at a large scale.
Are cricket farms
enclosed?
They are, and th-that's one
of the environmental benefits,
is that you can grow them
in a warehouse,
and it's significantly fewer
acres to grow more protein.
I'm interested
in how they meet their end.
You put them in a blender
and they stay to the sides,
and they fall down
and get s-- fried?
what happens?
We freeze them.
That's about the best way to go.
So it's -- it -- actually,
their natural metabolism
just slows down.
[ laughs ]
Pat, what does this
replace?
Like, do I eat this
and it's half the size
of a normal bar?
A bar with other all-natural
and organic ingredients...
Right.
...Would have half the protein
that that does.
So, you grind your crickets up
into flour?
Our name, Chapul, is actually
an Aztec word for "cricket,"
'cause they would do
the same thing.
They would gather crickets,
blend them up into a flour,
and make a protein-dense bread.
Look, I got to tell you.
I'm -- I'm a pretty brave guy,
but snakes, bugs...
Not brave enough, huh?
...Freak me right out.
So there's no way
I'm eating this stuff.
Thank you. I'm out.
O'LEARY: Let's -- let's talk
about the crickets,
because you didn't tell
the whole cricket story.
The truth about crickets
are that they are considered
a very important insect in many
countries around the world.
CROWLEY: Absolutely.
They're considered lucky.
Absolutely.
For example, in China,
people think
it's incredibly unlucky to kill
one, even accidentally.
How do you know that?
[ laughter ]
Listen, I'm Mr. Wonderful.
I know everything.
It's considered
really bad karma
to kill them,
let alone freeze them.
You got a whole bunch
of crickets right here.
They're not chirping
'cause they sense danger.
I agree. I agree.
That's what they sense.
You -- they know they're gonna
die a horrible death with you.
I just think, in this case,
those crickets are telling me
to stay out of this deal.
I'm out.
CORCORAN:
I have to hand it to you.
I ate that,
and it tastes great.
I can't tell the difference,
and I'm relieved to find out
that that crunch
that's on my tongue
are not the legs
of the crickets
and all that kind
of goofy stuff.
CUBAN: [ laughs ]
I think it's gonna be
a heck of a long journey
to convince people
that they're gonna love
to bite into something
with crickets in it.
I just think it is.
And whenever there's
a long journey in a business,
it means it costs you
more money to get there.
I'm out.
We-we've been very concerted
in our growth right now.
We've been intentionally trying
to fly under the radar
to some degree,
u-unsuccessfully.
We've been in national,
international publications
because of this.
I can't wrap my head
o-- around this.
I spend most of my life
trying to get away from
bugs, not eat them.
[ laughs ]
So, I'm sorry. I'm out.
All right, let's do this, Mark.
Let's do this.
CUBAN: Me and you.
Okay, Jiminy.
[ laughter ]
With the work you've done
to create cricket flour,
you're basically saying there's
no competition at all?
There's a couple
of up-and-coming companies.
What are they doing
compared to you guys?
What are they using
for flour?
They don't have
a product yet.
They've asked us
to sell it to them.
And we're --
we're debating right now whether
we should actually do that.
And why --
what's the debate?
Our business model is not
to invest in infrastructure,
and so I'd prefer
to purchase the flour
at some point if I could
and just be the brand
behind...
Wait.
...The insect movement.
I thou-- my understanding was
you own the flour, right?
We do. We do.
You created it,
that you're --
no one else has
this flour but you.
Correct.
From an FDA
perspective...
Right.
...You're the only one
that's approved, right?
Correct.
So why not have -- go to
these other guys and say,
"Okay, we'll sell you
our flour at, you know,
"three times
what it costs us to make,
but you have to brand it
'made with Chapul flour'"?
That's what -- that's why I say
we're -- we're on the fence,
and that's
what we're going to do
if we decide
to sell the flour.
Why wouldn't you do that?
It's a great idea.
I got to tell you,
the longer you're talking,
the more I realize you --
you have a great business.
But the business
is the flour.
The business
is not the energy bar.
Come on back in.
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out,
but Robert may have had
a change of heart.
HERJAVEC: I got to tell you,
the longer you're talking,
the more I realize you --
you have a great business.
But the business
is the flour.
The business
is not the energy bar.
The business
is the flour.
Come on back in.
We do have a lot
of people saying,
"When are you gonna sell
the flour,
when are you gonna sell
the flour?"
Right.
one reason I've held off
on doing that
is that I'm --
my passion is
the sustainability
of our food systems.
I love the fact
that you're exclusive.
You have no competition.
I mean --
yeah, it's great.
I'd like to be able
to help you,
but it's not worth my time
for 5%.
Sell me.
I-i'd be happy
to take more money.
I could do that for you,
if you want.
Oh, really?
[ laughter ]
that is so generous of you,
but it doesn't work for me,
right?
Okay.
Sell me.
Yeah, okay.
So, we're projecting $150,000
in sales.
I'm -- I'm --
we're past that, right?
Okay.
We're negotiating.
A-- like I'm saying,
we are at the brink.
We're a-- we're on the whole --
forget that.
we're negotiating.
he's past all that.
We're negotiat--
now it's numbers.
He wants to know --
talk money. talk money.
we're negotiating numbers.
CROWLEY:
All right, all right.
You want me to come back
with another offer?
Yeah.
You got to make it
cricket sweet for him.
Make me an offer.
All right, so, i-i know
what it takes to lead a team,
and I need to maintain
complete ownership,
so I need to maintain 51%
to lead the team that I have.
Okay, so you have
other investors?
Not investors, but, uh,
employees -- founders.
Foun-- that have equity?
That have equity.
Okay, so --
I have 80%.
You have 80%?
I have 80%.
Right.
So...Let's do 10%.
Make me an offer.
This is going to be...
Make me an offer.
...A $100 million business
in the next 5 years.
With any luck at all,
you might show a profit
before you're dead.
15% I could do, Mark.
Are you nuts?
Pat, I'll give you
the $50,000 for 20%.
Ooh, somebody
jumped back in.
I'll do it
for the 15%.
15%?
Yep.
Let's do this.
Let's do this, Mark.
Let's go make
some chirping money.
Appreciate it, buddy.
Thank you very much.
He snatched that one
from you.
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
CUBAN:
Let's eat some crickets.
yeah, let's eat
some crickets.
Good job, man.
Thank you very much.
Robert, here's
your consolation prize.
Oh, don't come near me.
[ laughter ]
oh, my God.
CROWLEY: I definitely gave away
more equity than I wanted,
but now that Mark
is one of our partners,
we can't be more excited to just
take this to the next level
and really feed the revolution.
You cost me 5%.
I'm not gonna let you
live that down. I'm
gonna get that back.
You were trying to get 20%
out of him?
Yeah.
Yeah, but Robert ruined that
for you.
[ groans ]
They are so ugly.
NARRATOR:
This season, we watched
Eric Child and Spencer Quinn
strike a deal
with Lori Greiner
for their multi-purpose
repair product, Fiberfix.
Lori...
You have a deal.
Good.
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.
[ train whistle blows ]
Prior to "Shark Tank,"
we had only done
about $300,000 in sales.
But since "Shark Tank,"
in only three months,
we've done almost $6 million
in sales nationwide.
Look at that.
10,000 units.
One of the reasons we decided
to partner with Lori
is because we knew
she brought
a ton of expertise
in home shopping.
Here we go. Look at this.
That was fiberfix.
Unbelievably strong,
this stuff.
QUINN: The day
after "Shark Tank" aired,
we were able to get
into one
of the most coveted positions
on QVC.
We have now taken orders
for over 10,000 kits.
[ laughs ]
and we were able to sell
through 45,000 rolls of fiberfix
in only 10 minutes.
We have sold out of everything
that we brought in.
Hey, we got to get 2,000 boxes
out today.
Can we do it?
[ cheering ]
All right! Let's do it!
CHILD: We've had so much demand
since "Shark Tank"
that we've had to move into
this 8,200-square-foot facility,
and we now have
a dedicated factory
that's producing over 10,000
rolls of fiberfix every day.
Fiberfix can now
be found in Home Depot,
ace hardware,
true value,
and many other retailers
nationwide.
We like to think
that we're continuing
the tradition
of American innovation.
It's awesome to be able
to create jobs
and provide a living wage
for lots of employees.
Our most exciting news yet
is the deal that Lori helped us
put together with Lowe's.
We're rolling out to all
1,800 stores nationwide.
So, do you all love it?
Hey, look who's here.
Hey!
GREINER: I've never seen
a product like this one.
There's nothing else
out there like it.
This is mandatory for everybody
to have in their home.
I think fiberfix
is going to be enormous.
CHILD: Doing our deal with Lori
has collapsed
three to five years of growth
to just a few months.
It's been an amazing ride
so far,
and we're excited to see
what the future holds.
ALL: Fiberfix it! Whoo!
NARRATOR:
Next up is a product
that solves
an alarming security issue
every homeowner
should know about.
Well, that patent's long
expired. That was back in 1979.
Were you broken in?
Is this how you invented --
that's how I came up --
yeah.
I was living in a condominium
where there were, uh --
the garages were separate
from the residence.
People were going out and buying
the -- you know, the padlocks.
And they would have to go out,
unlock the door,
open the door, get in the car,
back it out.
How much money did you put into
the business to get it started?
We've got $250,000
into this,
not including
the patent money.
O'LEARY:
You're a -- you've built a
better mousetrap. Get that.
Now, I don't know
how to sell it
unless I want to come and work
with you in your garage
and do all
the Marketing myself.
If you could get me in front
of the -- the right people
and get in the big-box stores,
I will do the work.
I'm probably the most --
hardest-working guy you
ever met.
And I do have
a confidential agreement
to be introduced
to a large garage-door
manufacturing company.
What do you mean, to be
introduced to them?
I have
a guaranteed introduction.
[ chuckles ]
JOHN: Huh?
That's one
we've never heard of.
Yeah, I've never heard that.
What does that mean?
