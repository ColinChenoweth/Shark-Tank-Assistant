Hello, sharks.
My name is Bryan White.
Bryan, my garage door
is locked all the time.
No, your garage door is
not locked all the time.
That's a facade.
You're telling me that
my traditional garage door,
that I use my clicker on --
I have for years --
that's not safe?
Somebody can just walk
in there,
open it up
just like this thief did?
Correct.
Wow.
If you could imagine breaking
into a locked vehicle
O'LEARY: Okay, so --
HERJAVEC: So, how does
your product work, Bryan?
How -- how do we --
how do we solve
this horrific problem
that is all over America?
Will it actually
stop the madness?
Stop the madness.
The way it works is when you --
when you push your remote
that comes with the lock kit,
the lock will unlock,
then you would --
you would close it,
WHITE: They're all sold,
they're all made the same way.
Do you install it yourself?
It's a do-it-yourself product.
WHITE:
For me, about 45 minutes,
but it would take somebody
that's never done one before
probably about a couple hours.
Bryan, here's the biggest
problem with your product.
How are you gonna educate
the Market for this?
Well, that's --
that's part --
that's why he's here.
yeah. exactly.
That's what I was depending
on you guys for. I -- you know?
That's not
your strength, huh?
Hmm.
Oh, that's
a tough one there.
So, you know the problem for --
I've taken it this far.
Have you done a video
for YouTube or anything?
Yes, I have
a YouTube video.
O'LEARY:
So, Bryan, if I invest --
I love the honesty,
though.
JOHN: Bryan, can you --
I love the honesty.
I can't help it.
It's who I am.
Bryan, Bryan,
Bryan, since you said --
Bryan, would you like to go
to retail with this?
yes.
But do you know anything
about that? What's your history?
Well, I have invented a --
you ever been parasailing,
or you know
what parasailing is?
yes.
I invented the device
that launches parasails
WHITE: That means the --
the person I'm working with
is very good friends
with the owner
of a major garage-door
manufacturer.
Oh.
You know, you got to be careful
with stuff like that.
Anybody who's charging you
for introduction
or stuff like that is
usually, uh...
a crook.
Yeah, so you've got to be
careful with that.
Can I tell you what you're
missing in this deal?
The most important ingredient.
You're missing an entrepreneur.
I am sure you are
probably the nicest person
we've ever met, period.
Thank you.
However --
but still,
she'll insult you.
However, I can't
even imagine you
walking into a big-box store,
I can't imagine you tracking
down billing, getting paid,
even if you had the sale.
You are an inventor,
not an entrepreneur.
I don't think you're gonna have
a easy time at all
getting people to invest
until you have
a great sales front
Bryan, I'm not gonna give you
all the verbal diarrhea
you just heard
from Barbara.
that's not --
cut that crap out.
I'm just going to say that
this opportu--
a little respect here.
Having said all that,
I got to get a door lock.
There's no question about it.
Bryan, I don't think
anybody's contesting
that there's
a huge Market there.
But you don't have
the infrastructure in place
for a salesperson,
Yeah, Bryan, my --
my friend,
he's the largest manufacturer
of car covers
in North America.
Robert may have
a closer relationship
with this one outlet.
I'm gonna go
after five or six.
Robert wants
to take 70%.
O'LEARY: Okay, Bryan, we've got
two offers on the table.
You'll get your $275,000
from Daymond.
He wants 40% of the equity,
contingent on licensing it
to a manufacturer that solves
your Marketing problem.
Robert has a special friend
that knows this industry
inside out.
There's no contingency,
but he wants 70%
of any revenue stream.
You keep 30%. He gets 70%.
Don't talk to him.
He's a crook.
HERJAVEC:
Bryan, I hate you!
[ laughter ]
I hate you!
I had no idea.
Bryan, get the hell
out of here!
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Robert.
I hate you!
I really like you.
I like him better.
Oh!
Ouch!
There goes a good man.
Robert, I never heard
an offer from -- from
you like that before.
What happened to you?
It's a lot of work.
I do know
it's a lot of work.
It's a lot of work
to get this done.
Oh, whoa. Yeah.
WHITE: I struck a deal
with a millionaire.
It's gonna get my product
out there.
It just feels fantastic.
I can't even tell you
how I feel.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank is
a quick fix to a daily problem.
