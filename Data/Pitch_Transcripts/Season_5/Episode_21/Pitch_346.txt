Hi, sharks.
My name is Max Valverde.
I'm from Boston, Massachusetts,
Max, what do you
think the chances are I'm
going to invest in that?
[ laughter ]
Kevin, Daymond, Daymond, Kevin,
you guys are the lucky ones.
No hair, no problem,
but for the rest of us,
basically anyone
who's ever had bed head
without the need or the time
for a shower
has a real use
for this product.
Our internet popularity
But it -- I just can't see
this as a big business, max.
This is basically
a shower cap.
[ laughs ]
VALVERDE: It is. It is.
With a --
with a bumper sticker on it.
But we've sold 7,000 units
in over 42 countries.
No, I get it, max.
It's just -- you know,
it's a tchotchke.
VALVERDE: I see what you're
saying, but that's why
I'm not coming in here for
a million-dollar valuation.
We're pricing at --
based on our -- our last
quarter's run rate --
look, I -- I get it.
I love it.
It's hysterical.
If you had told me you have
three different
follow-up products,
I'd invest
in a heartbeat.
But you don't.
For that reason, I'm out.
Well, h-here's the thing,
Mark, is that we are --
our -- our users
have been writing in
asking for bulk orders.
Users are asking --
bulk orders?
Yes.
Well, why wouldn't you
sell it to them?
O'LEARY: Like, max --
no, we are.
We're selling --
what for?
Because they're disposable.
They -- they only last
about six months.
So people are writing in --
what? Oh, no.
So they want five years' worth
of Morninghead?
Max, I have
some good news for you.
Enough. Don't laugh too hard
at the guy.
Ah.
Let me speak up.
May I speak up? All right.
So, max, let me ask you
something. Let me --
wait. No, no.
I'm speaking.
Oh, sorry.
Pipe down, little man.
Barbara's speaking,
young Daymond.
Please.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm your perfect customer,
honest to God,
because I wash my hair
every other day,
Max, I just don't see the vision
for this product. I'm out.
Max, it's not
a scalable business for me.
Max, max.
No problem.
This qualifies
as poo-poo on a stick.
I'm out. I'm out.
Good luck.
Good luck, max.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Good luck to you guys.
Thank you very much.
Let's try it out.
Wait. There's merit
in the product.
[ laughs ]
VALVERDE:
All laughing aside,
Morninghead is
a serious business,
