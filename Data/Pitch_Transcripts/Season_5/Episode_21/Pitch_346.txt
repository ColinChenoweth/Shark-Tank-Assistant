Hello, sharks.
My name is Bryan White.
And my company is
the Garage Door Lock.
And I'm here seeking $275,000
for 30% equity in my company.
There!
It just happened.
There's a home invasion every
15 seconds in this country.
So, think about it.
What's the biggest door
in your house,
and which is the only door
you never lock?
The garage door.
Most people never give it
a second thought
because most people
don't realize
how easy it is
for thieves to break in.
There!
It just happened again.
The door is open in seconds,
and all you're left with are
some old, rusty paint cans
and oil stains on the floor.
The Garage Door Lock
is the answer.
It's a steel deadbolt
that automatically
locks your garage door
to protect your belongings
and to give you peace of mind.
The Garage Door Lock
is universal.
It works with all openers
on any door.
We lock every other door
in our home.
Why leave
the largest one unlocked?
So, come on, sharks,
let's close the deal
and lock this thing up.
Bryan, my garage door
is locked all the time.
No, your garage door is
not locked all the time.
That's a facade.
You're telling me that
my traditional garage door,
that I use my clicker on --
I have for years --
that's not safe?
Somebody can just walk
in there,
open it up
just like this thief did?
Correct.
Wow.
If you could imagine breaking
into a locked vehicle
with a slim Jim and -- or a coat
hanger, it's very similar.
Wow.
You know that guy that --
from the hood that I'm
always talking about?
[ laughter ]
CUBAN: Yep. That's --
there he is.
Hey, that's him
right there.
O'LEARY: Okay, so --
HERJAVEC: So, how does
your product work, Bryan?
How -- how do we --
how do we solve
this horrific problem
that is all over America?
Will it actually
stop the madness?
Stop the madness.
The way it works is when you --
when you push your remote
that comes with the lock kit,
the lock will unlock,
then you would --
you would close it,
and it would lock
a-automatically.
O'LEARY: So, hang on.
Is this an add-on that I put on
to my existing garage door?
Yes, you don't need
to replace --
but why -- but why doesn't
the manufacturer
that sold me the door
in the first place
just do the same thing?
Why do I -- why are they selling
me a crappy garage door?
WHITE: They're all sold,
they're all made the same way.
Do you install it yourself?
It's a do-it-yourself product.
It comes with
all the hardware needed and
the instructions to do it.
And how long
does it take to install?
WHITE:
For me, about 45 minutes,
but it would take somebody
that's never done one before
probably about a couple hours.
And what do you sell it for?
We're selling them now
for $249.95.
How many have you sold?
Total to date -- 450...
...For about $112,000.
And where are you
selling them at?
Just online.
We have ze-- I have spent
zero Marketing dollars.
I've just put up the webs--
how do people find --
how are people finding you?
Usually after they
get broken in.
Bryan, here's the biggest
problem with your product.
How are you gonna educate
the Market for this?
Well, that's --
that's part --
that's why he's here.
yeah. exactly.
That's what I was depending
on you guys for. I -- you know?
That's not
your strength, huh?
Hmm.
Oh, that's
a tough one there.
So, you know the problem for --
I've taken it this far.
Have you done a video
for YouTube or anything?
Yes, I have
a YouTube video.
And have you gotten
much response to it?
Yes. Actually,
the sales spiked in 2010
when that video went up.
And did you do
a follow-up?
No.
You're just
a Marketing machine.
[ laughter ]
O'LEARY:
So, Bryan, if I invest --
I love the honesty,
though.
JOHN: Bryan, can you --
I love the honesty.
I can't help it.
It's who I am.
Bryan, Bryan,
Bryan, since you said --
Bryan, would you like to go
to retail with this?
yes.
But do you know anything
about that? What's your history?
Well, I have invented a --
you ever been parasailing,
or you know
what parasailing is?
yes.
I invented the device
that launches parasails
from a boat
and pulls it back in.
But I see those
all around the world.
Right.
WHITE: That means the --
the person I'm working with
is very good friends
with the owner
of a major garage-door
manufacturer.
Oh.
You know, you got to be careful
with stuff like that.
Anybody who's charging you
for introduction
or stuff like that is
usually, uh...
a crook.
Yeah, so you've got to be
careful with that.
Can I tell you what you're
missing in this deal?
The most important ingredient.
You're missing an entrepreneur.
I am sure you are
probably the nicest person
we've ever met, period.
Thank you.
However --
but still,
she'll insult you.
However, I can't
even imagine you
walking into a big-box store,
I can't imagine you tracking
down billing, getting paid,
even if you had the sale.
You are an inventor,
not an entrepreneur.
I don't think you're gonna have
a easy time at all
getting people to invest
until you have
a great sales front
linked with your arm, standing
right there with you.
Um, that's what I was hoping
to get here.
Okay, well, until you get that,
I'm out.
Well, uh, you know,
it didn't take me long
for you to demonstrate how easy
and shock you into seeing...
CORCORAN: Terrific product,
no doubt.
...How valuable the product is,
so I don't know that it's
that hard to do.
The business is worthless
until the product is sold.
Bryan, I'm not gonna give you
all the verbal diarrhea
you just heard
from Barbara.
that's not --
cut that crap out.
I'm just going to say that
this opportu--
a little respect here.
Having said all that,
I got to get a door lock.
There's no question about it.
So I'll probably go online
and buy one from you
because you've scared
the pants off me.
Yeah, me too.
But the opportunity is
not evident to me
on how I give you $275,000
and how I make a lot back
because you're missing
so much.
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thank you.
I just know that there's
a huge Market.
There's $1.3 billion spent
on steel garage doors.
Bryan, I don't think
anybody's contesting
that there's
a huge Market there.
But you don't have
the infrastructure in place
for a salesperson,
and that changes
the economics,
and you're looking for us
to do it.
I'm not in a position
to do that,
and so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
JOHN: I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
It's a Kevin O'Leary play.
It's put this
in my licensing division
and see if we
can get somebody to...
Oh, grasshopper,
you've learned.
...Go out there
and, uh, do something.
I think that America needs
to know
how to protect themselves,
needs to help themselves.
Every homeowner should know
about this.
I'll give you $275,000
for 40%,
but it's contingent on us
finding a license.
You should say yes.
S-sorry. Hang on.
What was the offer?
$275,000 for 40%,
and my only intention
is to license it.
Here's the offer
I'll make you.
$275,000,
and I want to --
in exchange for 70%.
70%?!
That's my offer.
What is wrong with you?
I have a guy who --
who does this
and sells products
like this.
I have absolutely no doubt
in my mind
I could put you in front
of those buyers immediately.
We have the same exact offers
on the table,
except for Robert,
the greedy savage he is,
he wants to take 70%.
Yeah, Bryan, my --
my friend,
he's the largest manufacturer
of car covers
in North America.
Robert may have
a closer relationship
with this one outlet.
I'm gonna go
after five or six.
Robert wants
to take 70%.
Those offers are usually done
in Nigeria and Kuwait
and things of that nature,
and I want to take...
[ laughs ]
Via e-mail, right?
...Yeah -- 40%.
O'LEARY: Okay, Bryan, we've got
two offers on the table.
You'll get your $275,000
from Daymond.
He wants 40% of the equity,
contingent on licensing it
to a manufacturer that solves
your Marketing problem.
Robert has a special friend
that knows this industry
inside out.
There's no contingency,
but he wants 70%
of any revenue stream.
You keep 30%. He gets 70%.
He'll solve your Marketing and
manufacturing problems also.
But that's a crime.
What are you going to do?
Daymond, would you counter
at 35%?
You got a deal.
Done.
You got a deal.
Robert, I really like you.
Don't talk to him.
He's a crook.
HERJAVEC:
Bryan, I hate you!
[ laughter ]
I hate you!
I had no idea.
Bryan, get the hell
out of here!
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Robert.
I hate you!
I really like you.
I like him better.
Oh!
Ouch!
There goes a good man.
Robert, I never heard
an offer from -- from
you like that before.
What happened to you?
It's a lot of work.
I do know
it's a lot of work.
It's a lot of work
to get this done.
Oh, whoa. Yeah.
WHITE: I struck a deal
with a millionaire.
It's gonna get my product
out there.
It just feels fantastic.
I can't even tell you
how I feel.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank is
a quick fix to a daily problem.
