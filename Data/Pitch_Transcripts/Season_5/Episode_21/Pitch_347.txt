Hi, sharks.
My name is Max Valverde.
I'm from Boston, Massachusetts,
and I'm the creator
of Morninghead.
Of what?
Morninghead.
Ah.
Ah. Of course.
I'm seeking $25,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in my company.
I try to exercise
every day after work.
I love mountain biking,
rock climbing,
basketball, you name it.
After I get a good sweat going,
I come home,
hit the shower,
and hit the hay.
The next morning,
I'm still totally clean,
but my bed head is insane.
And the last thing I want to do
is take another shower.
For years, I tried wetting
my hair in the sink.
Water gets everywhere,
and you never really get
the back of your head.
Morninghead solves this problem
once and for all.
It's a reusable, washable cap
with a super-absorbent material
on the inside.
Simply add water to it.
Allow that water to absorb.
Put it on your head.
Once it's on your head, you rub
it around for a few seconds.
Let that water absorb
into your hair.
No water dripping
down your neck, mind you,
so you can do it anywhere,
even if you're
fully clothed.
[ laughs ]
and seconds later,
your hair is completely wet.
No mess. Bed head's gone.
You can then style your hair
as you normally would,
as if you just toweled off
after a shower.
Max, what do you
think the chances are I'm
going to invest in that?
[ laughter ]
Kevin, Daymond, Daymond, Kevin,
you guys are the lucky ones.
No hair, no problem,
but for the rest of us,
basically anyone
who's ever had bed head
without the need or the time
for a shower
has a real use
for this product.
Our internet popularity
coupled with your capital
and expertise
ensures Morninghead is poised
to catch a viral wave,
create a paradigm shift
in morning grooming,
and in 12 months' time...
[ laughter ]
...one or more of you
will be able to tell friends
your best move of this year
was getting Morninghead.
Here we go.
This is our first run.
I designed all this,
basically.
Thank you.
This is a diaper
you put on your head.
Hey, it works.
O'LEARY: It's a shower cap.
I think that's
the challenge.
It's a diaper.
Right. But check this.
We'd be lucky if we sold
10, 20, 100 of these things.
We've sold 7,000
in over 42 countries.
This is a big product.
What?
Now it got
a little serious here.
You sold 7,000
of them?
Exactly.
For how much?
So, right now they're --
we're selling them
for $7.99 on our website.
Our cost is $1.19. We're gonna
get that closer to $1.
The margin is sick.
What were your total sales
to date?
To date -- $36,000.
How long have you been
in business?
18 months.
JOHN: Why do you need
the money?
What's the $25,000
gonna do for you?
Here's why we need the money.
If I can purchase
in a slightly larger bracket,
we'll be able to get the cost
from $1.19 down closer to $1.
And how do your customers
find you?
What I've done
is I've made my own videos.
We -- we've had 165,000 views
on our website.
To me, that says for every 1,000
people who sees our video,
sees our Marketing message,
we are getting 34 caps sold.
You're not living
off Morninghead, are you?
No.
What else
do you do?
So, I'm
a mechanical engineer.
I have a list of inventions,
a list of stuff I want to do.
What else you got?
This sucks.
No -- Kevin, think back
to after college
when you had those big --
that big mop of hair.
Yeah.
You never wet your hair
in the sink? You never --
i-i actually did, and I remember
those days fondly.
he never had hair.
But it -- I just can't see
this as a big business, max.
This is basically
a shower cap.
[ laughs ]
VALVERDE: It is. It is.
With a --
with a bumper sticker on it.
But we've sold 7,000 units
in over 42 countries.
No, I get it, max.
It's just -- you know,
it's a tchotchke.
And you're a great sales guy.
Yeah.
What a waste of you.
And so I say you take
some of the other ideas --
what are your other ideas, max?
w-what's next?
Mark, I learned long ago --
about five years ago, I had --
you know, I have pages
of inventions.
I was working on five,
six things at a time.
I really need to devote time
to one thing at a time.
And you've done
a great job of this.
I -- this is
an easy-money product.
It's good.
It's a big hit.
But it's not enormous,
and it's not gonna go anywhere.
You're not gonna be, you know,
on the Forbes 400 --
"the inventor of Morninghead,
$6.7 billion net worth,"
right? there's got --
"retail locations everywhere."
[ laughter ]
VALVERDE: I see what you're
saying, but that's why
I'm not coming in here for
a million-dollar valuation.
We're pricing at --
based on our -- our last
quarter's run rate --
look, I -- I get it.
I love it.
It's hysterical.
If you had told me you have
three different
follow-up products,
I'd invest
in a heartbeat.
But you don't.
For that reason, I'm out.
Well, h-here's the thing,
Mark, is that we are --
our -- our users
have been writing in
asking for bulk orders.
Users are asking --
bulk orders?
Yes.
Well, why wouldn't you
sell it to them?
O'LEARY: Like, max --
no, we are.
We're selling --
what for?
Because they're disposable.
They -- they only last
about six months.
So people are writing in --
what? Oh, no.
So they want five years' worth
of Morninghead?
Yes, they do,
and they're asking for
a subscription-based program.
A subscription-based
program?
[ laughter ]
$2 a month. $2 a month.
Oh!
Max, I have
some good news for you.
Enough. Don't laugh too hard
at the guy.
Ah.
Let me speak up.
May I speak up? All right.
So, max, let me ask you
something. Let me --
wait. No, no.
I'm speaking.
Oh, sorry.
Pipe down, little man.
Barbara's speaking,
young Daymond.
Please.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm your perfect customer,
honest to God,
because I wash my hair
every other day,
and it's true --
the second day,
if you shower at night,
your hair looks terrible.
right.
But bad news for you
is I discovered
another solution.
It's called
a damp face cloth.
I rub it around,
and I have perfect hair.
It's totally unnecessary.
I'm out.
Here's the thing, Barbara.
You of anyone
should know that --
that a funny name
and a gimmick can go a long way
with your "pigtails"
and with --
no, this gimmick is --
yeah, this gimmick is
not gonna go too far.
Max, I just don't see the vision
for this product. I'm out.
Max, it's not
a scalable business for me.
It's an item, and I think
you're gonna make a good
amount of money
and have some fun with it,
but I can't help you here.
I'm out.
Kevin, come on,
work with me here, Kevin.
No, no, no.
You like --
this -- no,
this -- this --
this company --
high growth potential.
You'll get
your $25,000 back.
Max, max.
No problem.
This qualifies
as poo-poo on a stick.
I'm out. I'm out.
Good luck.
Good luck, max.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Good luck to you guys.
Thank you very much.
Let's try it out.
Wait. There's merit
in the product.
[ laughs ]
VALVERDE:
All laughing aside,
Morninghead is
a serious business,
and contrary to what
the sharks are saying,
Morninghead is going to be
a million-dollar company.
NARRATOR: Next up is
an affordable study solution
for starving students.
