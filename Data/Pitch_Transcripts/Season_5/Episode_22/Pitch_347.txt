Hi, sharks.
I'm Nick Taranto.
TARANTO: Here's the
dirty secret of grocery.
When you start out,
the gross margins are
actually pretty good --
Josh, how much cash did you have
to spend to start the business?
We each put in north
of $50,000 to start.
Mm-hmm.
Josh is super-modest.
He's a great engineer
coming out of Georgia Tech.
Spent five years building
a software business.
I went to Dartmouth college
undergrad.
I did the joint degree
All right, Josh, look,
you've had great answers.
I just can't get over
having to make it.
I can't invest in something that
I would not use on some level.
We'll send you
a free trial,
TARANTO: So, you're
talking about 500k
at a 9 mil, at our...
yeah. you said
you left it open.
...What we were looking for,
at our valuation.
Yeah. Exactly.
Can we talk about it
real quick?
Why do you need to talk?
You basically told us
this is what you want,
so either you want
to do business --
we want you to be
a part of this, but we
need to just make sure
that our numbers
are working with...
I wouldn't
leave that room
with that kind of
a deal on the table.
...that we're on
the same page.
CUBAN: Seriously, though,
I mean, what am I missing here?
Because you said you wanted
advisory support.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know what
there is to talk about,
because I'm giving you
pretty much what you asked for.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd be happy
with that.
Deal.
Let's do it.
All right.
Fantastic.
Appreciate it, guys.
I might even learn
how to pound meat.
Super excited.
Can we hug it out,
man?
Hug it out, baby.
[ both laugh ]
Thank you,
guys.
Pleasure.
Good job.
Thanks, guys.
All right, thanks,
Mark.
CUBAN:
See you guys. Thanks, guys.
Bye.
I'll take that.
Yeah, brother.
Hey, there was no doubt these
guys had a solid business, Mark.
There's no doubt
about that.
Yep. I mean, look,
there's risks,
as there are
to any business,
but in this
particular case,
the horse is a decent horse,
the jockeys are great jockeys.
