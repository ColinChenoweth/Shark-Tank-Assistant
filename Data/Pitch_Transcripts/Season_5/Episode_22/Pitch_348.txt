Hi, sharks.
I'm Christie Barany.
I'm
Courtney Turich.
Courtney, I love the way
it folds back up.
Absolutely.
Christie, I think it's
a very clever product,
but what I heard you say
today is,
from what you know today,
you can't get the price point
to have it become
a mass-market product.
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
You guys, with the right
strategic partner, you could.
Right.
Yes.
I mean, I know
because I manufacture
things made out of fabric.
I have for 17 years.
You think you can bring
this down?
Yes, I do.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
You know what,
Mr. Wonderful?
We have parents who use
this as a time-out mat.
We might have to put you
over in the corner.
I'd rather put it over top
of him, not underneath him.
That's a good idea,
too.
They use it as
fort covers, too.
Listen, somebody
figured out
how to make an umbrella
so inexpensive,
TURICH: Yeah, exactly. Christie
has a rolling technique.
Mark's doing it the dad way --
just shove it in.
Yeah. No.
But it works
the same.
I feel like
a magician, right?
Oh, here I go!
I'm gonna --
wow.
he wins.
Whoo!
You beat me!
Hey, now. See?
See how easy it is?
Awesome.
Yeah, no,
it's actually --
well, if Mark
can do it...
You know, I want to see if,
Mark, you'll go in with me.
Okay.
We'll give you an offer
for the $100,000...
...35%.
