Hi, sharks.
I'm Nick Taranto.
And I'm Josh Hix.
And we're the founders
of Plated.
We're here today to ask you
for $500,000
in exchange for 4% equity in
our rapidly growing company.
[ laughter ]
at Plated, our mission is
to help Americans eat better.
Josh and I met
at Harvard business school.
After school, we both had
the same problem --
getting good food
on the table
was difficult, time-consuming,
and expensive.
We knew there had to be
a better way.
So we started Plated.
Plated delivers
all of the ingredients
in the exact portions
you need
to make a chef-designed,
delicious, nutritious meal
at home
in 30 minutes or less.
You come to the site,
pick out only exactly
what you want and how much,
and then we deliver
all of the ingredients,
along with recipe cards
and instructional videos
teaching you how to make
a delicious dish at home.
Since we launched
six months ago,
we've served tens of thousands
of meals around the Northeast.
Now we need you guys
to take us nationwide.
Sharks,
who's hungry?
GREINER: So, I want to see
if I understand this right.
I mean, I order
from a service.
They deliver right to my door
my groceries,
and all I have to do, then,
is just portion it out.
But then you still have to go
find the recipe.
You have to figure out
what you want to eat.
CUBAN: [ scoffs ]
If I'm using a recipe card --
recipe card, cookbook.
Six of one,
half dozen of the other.
We will take you from zero
to kitchen hero in 30 minutes.
Our customers tell us
that they love the experience
of getting everything
pre-portioned.
It's easy to make.
And the meal --
did you say it comes frozen?
All fresh.
GREINER:
And what does it cost?
Starts at
$10 per person.
You need to order
four portions.
So it's a
$40 minimum order.
Who pays shipping?
We do.
That's included
in the price.
GREINER: Is that sent overnight
with an ice pack in it?
You got it.
Same day
or overnight.
We have customers who
literally write in to us cold
and tell us that
twice a week,
they put the kids to bed, and
this is time with their spouse,
and it's a ritual, and it's
helping their relationship.
O'LEARY: But you don't need
to use your service to do that.
I'm very interested in
understanding the premium delta.
You don't,
but they are using it.
If I'm a family buying Lori's
way, or buying at the grocer's,
over the course of a year,
how much more is the family
paying to eat?
Yeah. So, here's where I think
you're going with that.
You know where I'm going
with it.
I have a lot of customers
that are grocery chains.
The margins are awful.
TARANTO: Here's the
dirty secret of grocery.
When you start out,
the gross margins are
actually pretty good --
somewhere between
40% and 50%.
But then you have spoilage
and overhead,
and that chews up
95% of the margin.
A grocery store throws away,
in some cases,
half of
the perishable food.
Plated delivers the amount
of spice you need
and not the $20 jar.
You get the amount
of basil you need
and not a giant thing
that will wilt.
Right, so you can make the
argument you're saving money
'cause you're not wasting.
We're throwing away less than
1% of what we order every week.
O'LEARY: Let's talk
about money for a second.
HERJAVEC: Well, Kevin,
can I just ask them?
They've been doing this
for how long?
Seven months.
Tell us about the actual numbers
you've had in seven months.
Our margins today
are 40%.
Right.
Those will go to 60%
at scale.
Josh, how much cash did you have
to spend to start the business?
We each put in north
of $50,000 to start.
CUBAN: And then you
raised how much money?
To date,
about $3 million.
At what valuation?
Post-money --
$9 1/2 million.
Okay.
HERJAVEC:
Talk to me about expansion.
We'll have a half a dozen or so
hubs around the country.
We have two active now.
From our warehouse
in Brooklyn
and our warehouse
outside of Chicago,
we cover the entire Northeast
and the entire Midwest.
We're starting in San Francisco
in about four weeks.
You're shipping California
from Chicago?
Tell me about
your background.
I was doing tech
startups before.
Worked in finance for a bit,
and met Nick at business school.
Mm-hmm.
Josh is super-modest.
He's a great engineer
coming out of Georgia Tech.
Spent five years building
a software business.
I went to Dartmouth college
undergrad.
I did the joint degree
at the Kennedy school
and Harvard business school,
went to the Marine Corps
after hbs.
Wow.
Very impressive.
So I became the only person
to ever do that.
And how long were you
in the marines for?
You got to do more
with your lives. You
haven't done enough.
So, I did a year
of active duty.
I became
an infantry officer,
and now I'm still
in the reserves.
wow.
That's great.
O'LEARY:
Have you considered, once
you've captured that customer,
perhaps there comes a week
when they're so busy
that they need
the food prepared.
Totally. Know where
you're going with that,
and the different
product lines
are six months from now
coming out.
But there's a ton of
competition.
There is
a ton of competition.
Sure, but this is
about a brand, right?
We are building
an amazing brand.
We put a lot of time
into this.
Yeah, but...
HERJAVEC: You guys are
obviously really smart guys,
but, I mean, I can't
go along for the ride
unless I buy
into the concept.
what are you
doubting?
Personally,
I love to eat healthy,
but I wouldn't order something
that I have to cook.
Cooking is believing.
When people try this,
they come back.
This is a game-changer,
because it allows you
to have an experience
you would not have
otherwise.
All right, Josh, look,
you've had great answers.
I just can't get over
having to make it.
I can't invest in something that
I would not use on some level.
We'll send you
a free trial,
and we'd like to get
your feedback afterwards.
please do.
Send it to his wife.
She definitely wears
the pants in the family.
I've seen her.
[ laughter ]
my wife wouldn't use it,
and I wouldn't use it.
You know, for that reason,
I'm out.
O'LEARY:
The question is,
how much of a premium am I,
as an investor,
paying for the risk that this is
not proprietary anywhere?
I think I could do the whole
thing for 3 million bucks.
Instead, I have to pay
three times that multiple
to play with you.
Go find two hard chargers
who are smart, data-driven,
and are gonna knock it
out of the park
we'll beat you
to it.
Like the way we're gonna
knock it out of the park,
we will crush whoever
you bring on board.
I'm out.
GREINER:
You know what? I cook a lot.
The trouble I'm having
with this
is that if you're
somebody who cooks --
and I think most people
in America cook --
if you do, you don't
really need somebody
to send you in a box
the ingredients,
'cause you go
to the grocery store --
CORCORAN:
That's not their customer.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Yeah, it is,
though, Barb.
I was wondering
if it was more
urban-centered.
It is, though.
Think about it.
Like, instead of going
and ordering takeout
and eating that greasy
thing of Thai food --
but you still
have to cook it.
That's where I have
a little bit of difficulty.
I'm seeing it as
your customer is somebody
who's too busy to cook,
so for that reason, I'm out.
Who do you see as your
biggest competition right now
and your greatest threat?
Takeout.
Well,
that's pretty big.
Takeout is your enemy,
and that's a big one.
And you know what takeout
has over your concept?
You can decide tonight what
you're in the mood for eating
and get it to your table
and eat within the hour.
It's done.
So that is an obstacle.
This isn't for me.
I'm out.
Guys, I would not be
a customer.
That said, I don't have
to be a customer
for a lot of things
that I take interest in.
The real question is,
how do you preempt competition?
How do you make this
so that it's an actual company,
as opposed to
turning it into
a feature from any
of the high-end supermarkets?
So, to touch on that, the
back-end logistics are not easy.
Also, we're signing customers
up for yearlong contracts.
Okay, tell us
about that.
You can either buy just
à LA carte, whenever you'd like,
or you can subscribe
and save.
And how many subscribers
do you have to that?
Several thousand.
Okay.
But this is another beauty of
the business, by the way.
We don't need a lot of customers
to make this a giant business.
Okay, so, guys,
I'll make you an offer.
I'm gonna offer you $500,000
at the $9 million valuation,
which is about 5.5%, 5.6%.
we'll figure that out.
And in addition,
I want advisory shares.
Whatever the best deal you give
to any of your other advisers --
that's what I want.
Do we have a deal?
TARANTO: So, you're
talking about 500k
at a 9 mil, at our...
yeah. you said
you left it open.
...What we were looking for,
at our valuation.
Yeah. Exactly.
Can we talk about it
real quick?
Why do you need to talk?
You basically told us
this is what you want,
so either you want
to do business --
we want you to be
a part of this, but we
need to just make sure
that our numbers
are working with...
I wouldn't
leave that room
with that kind of
a deal on the table.
...that we're on
the same page.
CUBAN: Seriously, though,
I mean, what am I missing here?
Because you said you wanted
advisory support.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know what
there is to talk about,
because I'm giving you
pretty much what you asked for.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd be happy
with that.
Deal.
Let's do it.
All right.
Fantastic.
Appreciate it, guys.
I might even learn
how to pound meat.
Super excited.
Can we hug it out,
man?
Hug it out, baby.
[ both laugh ]
Thank you,
guys.
Pleasure.
Good job.
Thanks, guys.
All right, thanks,
Mark.
CUBAN:
See you guys. Thanks, guys.
Bye.
I'll take that.
Yeah, brother.
Hey, there was no doubt these
guys had a solid business, Mark.
There's no doubt
about that.
Yep. I mean, look,
there's risks,
as there are
to any business,
but in this
particular case,
the horse is a decent horse,
the jockeys are great jockeys.
And you might learn
to cook, Mark.
I'm not gonna learn
how to cook, ever.
[ laughs ]
