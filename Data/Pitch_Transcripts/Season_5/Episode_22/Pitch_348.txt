Hi, sharks.
I'm Christie Barany.
I'm
Courtney Turich.
TOGETHER:
And we're the Monkey Mat Mamas.
We're seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 30% of our company.
Our product is the
award-winning Monkey Mat.
The Monkey Mat is the only
clean, portable surface
you can have
anywhere you go.
It's an innovative, new
essential for life on the go.
No bulky blankets
required.
So, the original inspiration
for the Monkey Mat
came during an unexpected
six-hour layover at the airport,
where I watched
my two beautiful girls
crawl and eat and play all over
those dirty, disgusting floors.
Ew.
Total cringe.
There has to be
a better way.
We searched for a solution
to meet our needs,
and when nothing existed,
we decided to create it.
There is nothing that provides
the portability, versatility,
and functionality with style
like the Monkey Mat.
The attached pouch
with easy buckle straps
secures onto anything --
cooler, stroller, bike handle,
purse, or diaper bag.
The custom fabric is soft,
durable, and water-repellant,
and grass, dirt, sand,
and messes shake right off.
The corners have weights
as well as loops
for additional grounding,
and in the center
of the mat,
there are loops for key
or toy attachments.
And, of course, it's
all machine-washable.
It comes in
four vibrant colors.
It is perfect
for outdoor concerts,
sporting events, picnics,
at the beach.
The response
has been fantastic,
but we need your help elevating
our business to the next level.
Can we see them?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Courtney, I love the way
it folds back up.
Absolutely.
People are very amazed when
they see how quick and easy
it goes back
into the pouch.
GREINER: So, I have
to ask, are you related?
We get asked that a lot,
and we are not related.
However,
we're dear friends.
We've known each other
for 11 years.
Christie, I think it's
a very clever product,
but what I heard you say
today is,
from what you know today,
you can't get the price point
to have it become
a mass-market product.
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
You guys, with the right
strategic partner, you could.
Right.
Yes.
I mean, I know
because I manufacture
things made out of fabric.
I have for 17 years.
You think you can bring
this down?
Yes, I do.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
You know what,
Mr. Wonderful?
We have parents who use
this as a time-out mat.
We might have to put you
over in the corner.
I'd rather put it over top
of him, not underneath him.
That's a good idea,
too.
They use it as
fort covers, too.
Listen, somebody
figured out
how to make an umbrella
so inexpensive,
when it rains, I buy one
and I throw it out afterwards.
That's where
you need to go.
And maybe you'll get there,
but it won't be with me.
I'm out.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's too small.
It should be larger.
The colors are off.
They're not hip.
And last, what you've heard
again and again,
it's way too expensive.
I think it's
a $10 product.
It should be priced exactly like
those cheap portable umbrellas
that come in a little kit.
that's it.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
Thanks
for your feedback.
I want you to do one thing
right now.
Sure.
Take it and fold it up
and put it back into the
zippered pouch for me.
Fold it or stuff it?
Well, I want to see
how hard it is.
I want to see how fast
you can do it.
Well, you
should do it.
They've been doing it
the whole time.
Look. Here's
the real test.
Yeah, Mark,
you do it.
[ laughter ]
it's a contest.
who's faster?
I cram.
TURICH: Yeah, exactly. Christie
has a rolling technique.
Mark's doing it the dad way --
just shove it in.
Yeah. No.
But it works
the same.
I feel like
a magician, right?
Oh, here I go!
I'm gonna --
wow.
he wins.
Whoo!
You beat me!
Hey, now. See?
See how easy it is?
Awesome.
Yeah, no,
it's actually --
well, if Mark
can do it...
You know, I want to see if,
Mark, you'll go in with me.
Okay.
We'll give you an offer
for the $100,000...
...35%.
I think between Mark and I
and our connections,
we can get this in.
I can help you
with the manufacturing
to get this way down.
And I could help you
with the online.
And he'll help you
with the online.
And I'll help you with
all the different retailers.
What do you guys think?
100k for 35%.
Got to tell us
right now.
Yep.
You're one handshake away.
Let's do this.
Let's do the deal.
There you go.
Done.
We're not
monkeying around.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
We're so excited.
Oh, well,
you're great.
Thank you, Lori.
It's gonna
be fabulous.
You covered everything.
I love that.
It's clever.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Whoo!
We did it!
[ laughs ]
way to go!
If you make your money back
on this within even five years,
six months.
Six months.
I will eat one of those mats.
I'll eat a mat.
GREINER: Yes, Mark.
That is not a magic carpet.
That is a ride to hell.
NARRATOR: Next up is a unique
alternative to delivered meals.
