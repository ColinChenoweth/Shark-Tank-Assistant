Hey, sharks.
I'm Joel Clark.
CLARK:
It's about 75% pancake mix,
Joel, let's be realistic.
Yeah.
This is a complete commodity.
There's nothing
proprietary about it.
HERJAVEC: Joel, you're making
half a million dollars a year.
That's fantastic.
I haven't heard any reason
why you need $500,000.
So, what
we want to do is
we want to spend a huge chunk
of that on slotting fees.
That's like buying your way
into the store...
Oh!
Oh.
Which we generate a return
on in 10 to 20 weeks.
Explain to everybody
what a slotting fee is.
You're buying
shelf space.
Yeah. You're paying an up-front
fee to get your shelf space.
