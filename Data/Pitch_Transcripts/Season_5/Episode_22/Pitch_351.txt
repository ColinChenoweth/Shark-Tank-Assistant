Hey, sharks.
I'm Joel Clark.
And I'm
Cameron Smith.
Our product
is Kodiak Cakes.
We're here seeking
$500,000
in exchange for 10%
of our business.
Kodiak Cakes is
a flapjack-and-waffle mix.
It's unique because it's made
with 100% whole grains,
has no added fats
or sugars,
and all you have to do
to make it is add water.
But most importantly,
it tastes amazing.
It really does.
And when I was
8 years old,
I went around
the neighborhood
and sold pancake mixes
like these out of a red wagon.
[ laughter ]
my mom had always wanted
to sell her whole-wheat
pancake recipe as a mix,
so we decided
to give it a try.
We're determined
to build Kodiak Cakes
into a nationally
recognized brand.
We believe
we have great products,
and we have
a proven track record.
Now, who's ready
to unleash your inner bear
and start flipping
flapjacks with us?
[ roars ]
aah!
So, we're gonna give you guys
a sample to try.
All right.
We've got
our berry syrup here.
Thank you.
You're so polite.
What kind of berries?
Mountain berries,
so it has a mix of berries.
There's about five different
berries in there.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Is this your product, too,
the berry syrup?
It is. Yeah. We have a line
of fruit syrups, as well.
Wow, they're very good.
Oh, thank you.
The berry syrup's
amazing.
The berry syrup's
really good.
That's good, isn't it?
I'm glad you like that.
I don't know. I love it.
I'd eat more.
Every day, we get letters
in to our website saying,
"hey, that is the best
pancake mix I have ever tried."
what's your track record
that's so proven?
Yeah, so,
we've actually been able
to get this product
into target stores nationwide.
Target?
Come on.
The first order to target
was about a $260,000 order.
That's a sizable order.
Good for you.
It was a huge order.
In a year,
how much more have you sold
since the first
$260,000?
So, this year, we'll do
around $1 million at target.
Wow.
We have an everyday
low price with target,
but we still have
a 45% margin on that price.
They rolled it out into over
1,600 target stores nationwide.
Are they reordering?
They are.
That's why we came here,
'cause we need the money now
to grow more so we can launch
some innovative products.
But why not just borrow money
against your receivables?
Right.
Why not roll over the money
that you're bringing in
and not even have to take out
any type of loan?
Yeah, we could grow
the pancake mix like we are,
but we're ready to explode
this business now.
How much you gonna sell?
So, this year, we're looking
to do $5 million.
And last year,
we did $2.5 million,
so we're looking
to double.
CORCORAN: And all
in pancake mix?
CLARK:
It's about 75% pancake mix,
and then the syrups
are about 22%,
and then we have
a couple of other products.
Joel, let's be realistic.
Yeah.
This is a complete commodity.
There's nothing
proprietary about it.
What you have here
is a brand you're building.
Ultimately,
if the brand becomes big enough,
we hope that
a major takes it out
because
it's starting to itch
and steal some
of their shelf space.
Sure.
Yeah.
You're not there yet,
because $5 million in
this category is not that much.
Right.
But it's
an interesting beginning.
So let's just focus on what
you've asked for this company.
You're telling me
you want $500,000 for 10%.
That imputes
a value of $5 million.
Yeah.
You know
you're not worth that.
Well, we think
we are.
You're trying to sell it to me
at 10 times your pretax profits.
Never.
What we've found is that
people are willing to pay
for that whole-grain,
healthy breakfast product.
A lot of those other
white-flour, white-mix
pancake mixes out there,
those are commodities.
But those guys, without
mentioning their brand --
no.
famous aunt involved,
here.
[ laughter ]
She leads the share
in this market.
So you're taking share
away from her,
yeah.
And I would think
that she's significantly lower
in price right now.
She is.
How much lower?
Up to 50%.
You think that
the average mom out there
is gonna walk
into a store
and pay twice as much
for a premium product.
They are, though.
HERJAVEC: Joel, you're making
half a million dollars a year.
That's fantastic.
I haven't heard any reason
why you need $500,000.
So, what
we want to do is
we want to spend a huge chunk
of that on slotting fees.
That's like buying your way
into the store...
Oh!
Oh.
Which we generate a return
on in 10 to 20 weeks.
Explain to everybody
what a slotting fee is.
You're buying
shelf space.
Yeah. You're paying an up-front
fee to get your shelf space.
Have you done that
before?
We have done that for 17 years,
and we get a return on it.
I have to defend you,
because there's a million people
that would want to pay
the same slotting fee,
so they picked you.
and you made it work.
He did it. He got
to target without it.
Let's say I give you
$500,000, all right?
How do I get my money back,
and when?
We're gonna build this thing
to $20 million in four years.
How much can you sell
a $20 million commodity
pancake business for?
Well, this is not a
commodity pancake business.
This is a branded
pancake business.
Let's not argue
about that.
Tell me how much
you're planning to sell it for.
Well, at that point,
we're gonna go for one to
one and a half times revenue.
I believe we'll get
one and a half times,
so we'll go
for $30 million.
Food companies --
I'm sorry --
just don't trade
for 10 times cash flow.
They do -- 8 to 10 times.
Our research shows that.
We've talked
to investment bankers.
We're talking to people
all the time.
I love it
when people tell you that,
but they never write a check
for you.
I'm the only disciplined,
rational investor up here.
Everybody else gets
emotionally involved,
[ laughter ]
all right? not me.
All right, guys.
Let me take a shot at this.
I don't do good deals.
I do great deals, okay?
[ laughs ]
and I make sure
they're great deals
so that both sides
make money.
I'll tell you
what your company's worth today,
and I'm right.
it's worth $2 million, okay?
You have to give up
25% equity, minimum,
for this 500k,
because you have to
jump this thing by 30%
to even make it something that a
major competitor will take out.
You have a lot of work
ahead of you,
and for that ride,
I'd want a new-risk premium --
50% of the business.
NARRATOR:
All five sharks are still in.
Kevin is interested
but believes the company
is highly overvalued.
You have a lot of work
ahead of you.
And for that ride,
I'd want a new-risk premium --
50% of the business.
I said I do great deals.
That would be a great deal.
That would make sense.
That'd be a great deal
for you.
[ laughter ]
you know, when
the devil looks at you,
he always says
it's a great deal, right?
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.
But listen, I know you're
not gonna accept that offer,
so I'm not gonna make it,
and I'm out.
Here's where I'm at.
I'd love to be involved,
but there's got to be
a premium in it for me.
I mean, I think
there's a lot of risk,
so I'm gonna price-end
that risk for me.
I'll give you the $500,000
for 35%.
Appreciate the offer.
We do.
Which means you're taking
the offer?
Barbara, we want to hear
from you before we --
I have a partial offer.
I'm gonna give you
$250,000 for 20%,
but you're going to have to
get the other $250,000
from one other shark.
GREINER:
You know what?
I have to love
what I get into,
and I don't really
like pancakes...
So I'm out.
You know, I think
it's a good business,
but I just think you're
gonna have more challenges.
You've been on a nice ride.
You've executed incredibly well.
