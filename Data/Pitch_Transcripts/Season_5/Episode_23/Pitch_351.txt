Hi, sharks.
I'm Scott Adams.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Josh Faherty.
ADAMS: Good question.
They're 165 pounds, so it's
really hard to tip them over.
So, how much
does this cost?
From $18.99 all the way
up to $2,850.
ADAMS:
We're creating jobs.
If you -- you can have
that employee
that you run out
waving the sign
You're a good salesman,
Scott.
Thank you.
What do you want to do
with the money?
What's the world-domination
plan?
We are gonna sell 1,200 units
over the next 12 months.
We're gonna hire
eight sales reps,
Scott, he's out.
Turn him off.
I'm out. Turn me off.
ADAMS: Barbara? Lori?
I was thinking about
the franchises I owned
of real-estate brokers.
What a natural audience
for this.
Absolutely.
They pull it out of the back
of their car,
FAHERTY: Sorry, Barbara.
Just throw a bucket of water
on her. She'll melt.
GREINER: Don't turn Lori off!
She's the only one left!
ADAMS: Lori.
[ laughter ]
first of all, I like --
you sell a ton of these
on QVC?
[ laughs ]
No.
CORCORAN: No way, Jose.
But I sell a lot
of other places than QVC.
I think that this is
an extremely smart new way
ADAMS: So, would that be
10% for Mark,
ADAMS: That's
a good point, Lori.
I'll get it in front of them.
Scott, you know what Barbara
will do for you?
O'LEARY: Scott,
she works for me!
She'll sell you your mansion
once we make a lot of money.
But you need to say yes
now to us.
GREINER: Ugh.
I really am not comfortable
with you debating this,
because it's so much better
an offer from --
I'm -- I'm gonna order
at least five of them.
Five of them?! What a joke.
Five of them?!
What are you gonna do,
Scott?
Absolutely.
Well, so, we see a value in all
five of you, just so you know.
We appreciate it.
Um, we definitely see a value
in -- in mass quantity
ADAMS: Looking forward
to working with you.
I said I wanted it.
HERJAVEC: Kevin,
this is an extra-large.
Then all of a sudden,
you all wanted it.
This must be yours.
Lori, I can't thank you enough.
We really appreciate it.
Without you, this wouldn't
have happened.
I wanted to work with you.
I really did.
I just saw a value in working
with three versus two.
It wasn't a male
versus female.
It definitely was!
It is a guy thing.
I love it.
Man it up!
You know, I'm not gonna let
any woman in America
ever buy a sign
from them.
yeah.
That's right. Women --
I'm gonna start a campaign.
How insulting!
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a re-imagined
favorite snack food.
Hello, sharks.
