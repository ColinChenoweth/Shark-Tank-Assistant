Hi, sharks.
I'm Scott Adams.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Josh Faherty.
And we're from Sacramento,
California.
We are the inventors
of Velocity Signs.
We are seeking $225,000
in exchange for 15% equity stake
in our business.
One day, I was working
in Los Angeles,
driving to a client meeting,
and it was 110 degrees outside.
I looked over on the corner
and saw a poor guy
waving a sign around,
dripping sweat.
His shirt was wet.
Then he rested
in a shaded area
with his sign facedown.
My first thought was,
"poor guy!
He's gonna die
of heat exhaustion."
My second thought -- "There's
got to be a better way."
That's when we launched
Velocity Signs.
[ laughter ]
Portable, rechargeable,
interchangeable,
self-standing,
and most importantly,
they're made to grab
your attention
with its unique movement.
Sharks,
invest in Velocity Signs.
Help us shake our way into every
business all over the world
and put some velocity
back in the American economy.
Do you guys got, like,
a B.B. gun or something?
It's like we're at the arcade.
Bam, bam.
[ laughter ]
Down goes Kevin.
You're the guy that
looks like something
out of a horror movie.
[ laughing ] Hey!
How substantial are they? Are
they on their feet s-securely?
ADAMS: Good question.
They're 165 pounds, so it's
really hard to tip them over.
So, how much
does this cost?
From $18.99 all the way
up to $2,850.
And how many
have you sold?
We've sold 125
over the last 12 months.
That's all, huh?
125 a year.
So, about $257,000
for over 12 months.
And what -- what's your cost
on a typical --
the Cuban's gonna cost you
about -- about $1,000
cost of goods sold.
To you.
To -- to make it, for me.
Correct.
Oh, okay.
How effective
h-have you found
these are
for your customers?
What do they tell you back?
On average, our clients get
a 15% return on investment.
CUBAN:
What kind of clients?
Our biggest client right now
is little Caesars,
who's got 3,560 locations
worldwide
in 50 different countries.
How many days do I have
to pay a student
to spin signs before I pay
for one of these?
I think the best analogy is
that our machines run nonstop,
so you're getting full use
out of these machines
versus human sign-spinners,
who have to take breaks.
They, uh --
they're hard to manage.
They get tired.
They walk off on the job.
I hate those humans.
The turnover's
extremely high.
GREINER: You know what?
I'll tell you something else.
I always feel sorry
for them.
CORCORAN: Yes.
They have a job, Lori!
ADAMS:
We're creating jobs.
If you -- you can have
that employee
that you run out
waving the sign
move in and do some
more productive work
for your business,
because you're gonna save money
by hiring
that st-- human sign-spinner,
but you're also gonna increase
sales by an average of 15%.
That's $90,000 in new revenue
you can put
to hiring new people.
Well, that's
a decent answer.
So they'll be displaced.
Okay.
They'll be -- they'll be hired
in other positions
that businesses
are gonna be hiring for.
You're a good salesman,
Scott.
Thank you.
What do you want to do
with the money?
What's the world-domination
plan?
We are gonna sell 1,200 units
over the next 12 months.
We're gonna hire
eight sales reps,
and we're gonna hire
four administrative staff.
The other challenge
has been --
I think it's clever, but I
invested in a billboard company
many, many,
many years ago,
and we deal with the --
the electronic signage,
and it was a horrible,
miserable failure.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Now, one thing we found is
that the consumer
gets very old very quickly
with the movement,
and then it needs
to be changed.
Right.
Not a big fan of this business,
so I'm out.
Okay. Robert.
[ laughs ]
GREINER: Cut him off?
No! No!
Gonna turn it off.
[ laughter ]
Smart.
O'LEARY: I love it.
You never told us how much,
on your own forecast,
you think you're going to make
next year.
In very conservative
numbers,
we're gonna
bring in $2.5 million
and bring in $500,000
in sales.
I would like to see a year
or two worth of sales
so that we can see
what the real number is.
My expectation is it'll be
a lot less than you think.
I'm saying I don't know,
so I'm out.
Thank you. Cut it.
[ laughter ]
Thank God!
CUBAN:
I like the business.
The problem is that once you
get one, you don't need two.
I'm out.
Scott, he's out.
Turn him off.
I'm out. Turn me off.
ADAMS: Barbara? Lori?
I was thinking about
the franchises I owned
of real-estate brokers.
What a natural audience
for this.
Absolutely.
They pull it out of the back
of their car,
and they put it
for an open-house sign...
Oh, wow. Absolutely.
...That nobody even wants
to ever go to anymore,
'cause they're tired of seeing
the signs.
And, by the way, why does she
look so much prettier than me?
I'm really pissed over that.
[ laughter ]
and -- and -- but here's
the problem
with even
the real-estate franchisees
or the individual brokers
or agents.
165 pounds out of the trunk
of their car to move it.
So even that perfect
application is filled with --
we didn't tell you
about a new product
we've been working on,
as well.
It stakes in the ground
for real-estate agents.
And then it wiggles.
Smaller battery used
for a short --
because open houses
are all day long.
Why didn't you say it?
Why didn't you tell us about it?
That's a better product.
But you don't have it yet,
so I wish I could see
that product.
Mm-hmm.
If that were the case,
I'd be in.
But I'm sorry.
I'm out.
But would you --
don't turn me off.
Get rid of Lori.
I'm really annoyed
that she's looking
so good up there.
Turn her off!
You don't -- you don't have
to turn Barbara off.
FAHERTY: Sorry, Barbara.
Just throw a bucket of water
on her. She'll melt.
GREINER: Don't turn Lori off!
She's the only one left!
ADAMS: Lori.
[ laughter ]
first of all, I like --
you sell a ton of these
on QVC?
[ laughs ]
No.
CORCORAN: No way, Jose.
But I sell a lot
of other places than QVC.
I think that this is
an extremely smart new way
to draw attention to
brick-and-mortar retail stores
that are on the street
that are hurting right now,
and I think retailers
are going to really love this.
I also like that you'll be
helping these smaller businesses
keep their jobs
and keep their stores.
So I'll offer you $225,000
for 30% of your business.
And, hopefully, together,
we can get this really big and
really out there everywhere,
'cause every franchise
needs this.
I -- we definitely see a value
in your support
and your experience.
O'LEARY:
I'll tell you what.
If you take that deal,
and Lori will have me,
I'll come in on it.
I like it at that valuation.
I'll come in if you want.
I'll come in as a third.
What just happened?!
What just happened?
NARRATOR:
Four sharks were out,
but after Lori
expresses interest,
Kevin and Mark
want a piece of the action.
What just happened?!
What just happened?
ADAMS: So, would that be
10% for Mark,
10% for you,
and 10% for Lori?
Yeah. We'd do that deal,
if Lori says yes.
CUBAN: Yeah.
Are you okay
with that, Lori?
Okay.
So, I made the offer.
O'LEARY: I could sell
a lot of these.
I said $225,000
at 30%, and --
or better yet,
Robert, Kevin, and I
could go in together
if she doesn't like it.
I'm good with that.
And --
oh, yeah?
then I'll go in with Lori.
Wait!
Who believed in you?
No problem.
ADAMS: That's
a good point, Lori.
And who were all the lovely,
little sharks that said,
"I don't believe in you,"
and they dropped out?
O'LEARY: You know what?
I changed my mind.
Instead,
because they're that way --
nobody said that!
I -- Barb, want to go in
with me?
If 30% is available --
no problem at all, baby.
I'm right there with you.
Okay, guys, Barbara and I,
we're going in together,
$225,000 at 25%?
O'LEARY: Here's our deal.
You get three sharks for 30% --
10% each.
We have so many businesses
we can apply this to,
so many contacts
we can phone for you.
Oh, please.
We will set you on fire.
You guys know
whose history --
you know the histories
of Barb and I.
This is not a QVC product!
You know what we've done.
Three is always better than two.
Any math will tell you that.
No, and the only reason
they jumped back in
is because I said what I said
about believing in you...
absolutely.
...And bringing back retailers
and life in America.
What's your offer, Lori?
What's your offer?!
So Barb and I are
at $225,000 for 25%.
I'll get it in front of them.
Scott, you know what Barbara
will do for you?
O'LEARY: Scott,
she works for me!
She'll sell you your mansion
once we make a lot of money.
But you need to say yes
now to us.
GREINER: Ugh.
I really am not comfortable
with you debating this,
because it's so much better
an offer from --
I'm -- I'm gonna order
at least five of them.
Five of them?! What a joke.
Five of them?!
What are you gonna do,
Scott?
Absolutely.
Well, so, we see a value in all
five of you, just so you know.
We appreciate it.
Um, we definitely see a value
in -- in mass quantity
and having three sharks
versus two sharks.
Guys, are you willing
to come down to 25%?
Can't do it.
No.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Yep.
We bring so much value.
We don't go at a discount.
Barb, how do you feel
about that?
There are three of us.
We need a -- we need a
bigger number.
If you want to know,
if you ask one more time,
I'm gonna go out.
That's right.
That is so insulting.
Okay.
Uh, we appreciate it.
We think there's more value
en masse,
so we're gonna go ahead and go
with Mark, Kevin, and Robert.
Yes, sir!
All right!
GREINER: That was horrible.
How insulting!
That was horrible.
[ indistinct conversations ]
look at that. look at us.
what kills me is...
I'm excited.
...None of the three of you
even wanted this.
ADAMS: Looking forward
to working with you.
I said I wanted it.
HERJAVEC: Kevin,
this is an extra-large.
Then all of a sudden,
you all wanted it.
This must be yours.
Lori, I can't thank you enough.
We really appreciate it.
Without you, this wouldn't
have happened.
I wanted to work with you.
I really did.
I just saw a value in working
with three versus two.
It wasn't a male
versus female.
It definitely was!
It is a guy thing.
I love it.
Man it up!
You know, I'm not gonna let
any woman in America
ever buy a sign
from them.
yeah.
That's right. Women --
I'm gonna start a campaign.
How insulting!
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a re-imagined
favorite snack food.
Hello, sharks.
