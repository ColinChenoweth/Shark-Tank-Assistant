First into the tank
is a dynamic product
designed to help businesses
attract customers.
I can't follow you down
this path to hell,
and I won't do it.
I'm out.
I respect that. Thank you.
Hi. My name is Pat Yates.
My company is Happy Feet,
and I'm seeking $375,000
for 15% equity in my company.
Happy feet are not
your grandma's slippers.
They're playful, fun,
and so comfortable, they're
like walking on pillows.
They come in almost every color
imaginable,
including our top-selling
leopard and zebra print,
as well as the red, black, and
white collegiate-licensed design
of my beloved
Louisville cardinals.
Ha!
[ laughter ]
Also, don't forget about
our cool animal styles --
lion, tiger, giraffe, and
the ever-tough shark slippers.
Happy feet are great
for people of all ages.
Now, sales are great,
but we need your help
to expand
in our international markets
as well as to take it
into retail.
Now, which of you sharks
is ready to take the walk
with Happy Feet?
And I know you won't want
to take them off.
Awesome. Yeah.
Bring them on.
GREINER: Good.
All right, so, we're gonna do it
a little different.
I know
where that pair is going.
Mark, you're an athlete,
a basketball guy.
Yeah, I know.
Basketball guy,
basketball guy.
Go, hoosiers, baby.
There you go. All right.
Go, hoosiers.
GREINER: [ laughs ]
oh, come on, Mark.
Go, hoosiers.
The hoosiers?
Barbara, you got the leopard.
Grr. There you go.
Got to catch it. Oh, see?
HERJAVEC: She's an animal.
Doggone!
Give me another shot.
I -- but I threw it short,
though.
[ sighs ] Too bad.
For the shark
of all sharks, Mr. O'Leary.
O'LEARY: Hey! Love it.
See, he can't catch,
either!
All right, Lori.
You're gonna get the neon zebra.
For you, Robert -- penguin.
A penguin?!
What the hell is that?!
I don't know! We came up
with an animal!
It's just a cute animal!
What am I?!
What am I,
the friggin' fluffy shark?!
I think about Canada,
I think of penguin.
What's wrong with that?
Give me the lion.
I don't want the penguin!
You want the lion? Okay.
Hold on. Go ahead. Give it back.
All right.
We'll get you the lion.
I think you'd look good
in a penguin, Robert.
There we go.
Oh, my gosh.
These are my new shoes!
All right!
YATES: There we go.
These are amazing.
They're like moon boots.
Absolutely.
They're like moon boots.
Exactly.
CUBAN: I used to have
a pair of moon boots.
Wow.
HERJAVEC:
They're so comfortable!
Wow.
They really are.
See? Look at that.
Wow.
Look how good he looks
in those sharks.
HERJAVEC: Wow. Why are these
so comfortable, pat?
Well, it is -- it's that 1-inch
foam rubber bottom.
It's a dense foam rubber
that we put in them.
Just, the whole thing,
when you step down on it,
it's like walking
on pillows.
So, pat, $375,000 for 15%.
Your sales must be amazing!
We've done $6.5 million
in the last 3 years...
You got to be kidding.
...Between internet
and wholesale -- yes.
HERJAVEC: What are your sales
last year?
GREINER: What stores --
what stores are you in?
What are your sales
last year?
Sales last year
were $2.65 million.
And the year before?
Uh, $2.4 million.
So, pat,
out of the $2.6 million,
what percentage is online?
It's -- actually,
of that $2.6 million,
it was probably
about $2.2 million,
which is
the highest margin portion.
You're selling that
much stuff online? Wow.
Wow.
And what does it
cost you to make?
The sneaker-slipper styles
cost about $5.50.
We sell them $24.99 to $29.99,
which is about a 400% markup
right there.
That's a great margin.
Pat, that $2.6 million
you sold last year --
what was your profit
on that?
About $600,000.
So, where are you spending
all your money?
Um...
Because with that big
of margins,
you should be making
more than $600,000.
We do a ton of free shipping
at our busiest time,
which is holiday, which knocks
that margin down significantly.
But the problem was, the margin
and the seasonality
of the business
being a little bit seasonal
in the winter,
it's sort of shot down
some of those profits,
and I didn't have --
why haven't you focused
on getting
into major retail stores?
Well, there are
several reasons.
Okay.
Number one --
the size of the product.
They were afraid
it was too big.
Exactly.
O'LEARY: It takes up 2 1/2 times
the linear square feet
that an ordinary shoe
would take.
It is.
It's never gonna go
into retail.
O'LEARY: I have
a different problem with it.
You got to help me with this,
'cause this is the thing
that's bugging me the most.
There's nothing proprietary
about this stuff.
I'm very worried
that someone else
is gonna come in here
and drop the prices by 30%.
Yeah.
...Because I've never seen
margins like this in slippers.
Like, this is incredible.
Do you have competitors
that are doing the same thing?
We -- we don't.
Anybody that you see
selling these online
are buying from us.
GREINER: How are people
knowing you're there?
This is the thing
I want to understand,
'cause you have
an amazing online business.
We also did a license with a
girl who was on a reality show
that really built a lot
of social following behind it
that we still have, as well.
who?
Snooki.
We utilized her Twitter account
as well as her social,
to be able to grow it.
who is it?
was it Snooki?
Another -- yeah.
[ chuckles ]
and we ended up getting
onto a business
where we could find
those mid-level social stars
that would help get our name
out there and grow it.
Are you saying
Snooki's mid-level?
She was
when we found her.
[ laughter ]
She won't like
that I said that.
But she's fantastic.
Wow. Wow.
And how much are you having
to pay for those folks?
Uh, it's about 12%.
Ah, therein lies --
that's where
the money's going.
That's where the money --
it's not --
it's not all of it
going to that,
though, Mark.
no, but --
but it's actually fed
what we're growing.
So we've really tried to create
our own marketing.
That's really what I'm about.
So, proprietary's important,
but when you have
someone like me
that's gonna go out and try
to market and work hard --
pat, you're killing it!
Well -- right!
CORCORAN:
Pat, time out for a moment.
There's something that's
really disturbing me.
You know, it feels to me
as though you may have peaked
or are maybe
even on the way down.
But it feels to me you're not
going to get bigger. I'm out.
I mean --
pat, look, you --
great business, right?
I'm an intense entrepreneur,
Robert.
Oh, my friend,
I get that from you.
This is
a real business.
Right.
You've done
a fantastic job.
Pat, I-I don't see
where I add value.
I like to add value.
I'm a good operator,
just like you are.
I like to run things.
I like to add value to people.
I don't like to just write
a check to something.
Let me ask you
one other question,
one thing
I was gonna talk about.
Look, I-I don't want you
to waste all your time with me.
You're doing a great job.
I don't want to write a check,
and that's it. I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
I understand.
O'LEARY: How many pair
are you gonna sell this year?
75,000 to 100,000.
The challenge is,
15% is nothing, nothing to me.
Right.
It just --
it's not exciting.
I understand.
pat, three sharks
are out now.
All roads lead back.
You know,
I-I-I really appreciate that.
Um, I don't think it's
the right situation for me.
I really appreciate
the offer, but...
Hallelujah.
The only thing that I could do
is maybe counter back.
I really want you all --
what is your counter?
NARRATOR:
Three sharks are out.
Pat has an offer
from Kevin and Lori --
$375,000 for a 6% stake,
plus a $3 royalty
which drops to $1.50
after the investment
is repaid,
which pat feels
is too steep.
What is your counter?
I would be willing to do
$375,000 for 20%,
to go into that and -- and have
you all help me grow it.
I think that that is
a-a reasonable number.
I --
you understand the value
of two sharks?
Do you have any idea
what's going to happen
to your sales?
I -- 100%. I just don't like
the royalty structure.
I would love to find a
percentage that you all
make sense.
Okay, so you don't like
my royalty deal.
If you want me to go
straight equity,
that's gonna take me a lot
longer to get my money back,
so I've got to increase
the amount I'm going to get.
Here's the new offer --
and Lori may come in with me,
as she did
on the royalty deal --
$375,000 for 30%.
I'll do that.
I'm in with you.
I'll give you $375,000
for 30%.
Wow.
O'LEARY: Robert's jumped
back into this.
Pat's selling me!
...$375,000 for 30%,
which was the exact same offer
that Lori and I gave you.
The difference is you get
two sharks instead of one.
Right.
I think that if either one
of you would do 25%,
that's gonna be my top end.
Why would you take that, though?
Why would you do that?
How much cash do you guys have
in the bank right now?
Well, I mean,
we have $200,000.
25%, $375,000.
O'LEARY: 25%?
But I would like them
to be able to help
with -- with where
we're headed.
I don't know
that I can --
pat, I'll take
that deal.
Wait. We didn't hear it.
I'm a big guy.
Whoa, whoa! Wait.
$375,000, 25%.
Do we have a deal?
Wait.
Done.
Done! I like you, pat!
CORCORAN: Wow. Bam.
Wham, bam,
thank you, Ma'am.
Great job!
Well, we were talking.
We shouldn't have been talking.
There you have it.
CORCORAN: Wow!
That was
a great presentation.
Thank you.
Appreciate it, guys.
Robert,
that was a great move!
CORCORAN: Wow, Robert.
He sees us talking.
You deserve to lose it.
Don't turn your back
in the tank.
Good job, Robert.
Why, thank you, Mark.
You can learn a thing or two
from me.
I did on that one.
YATES:
It was incredible, I mean,
especially
to pull Robert back in
after he had already gone
through it and said he was out.
He saw my passion.
He saw my interest.
And he's really a guy
that I had at the top of my list
of who I wanted,
so I'm extremely excited.
NARRATOR: Last season,
Byron young pitched the sharks
his multifunctional
beanbag chair.
There's a bed inside!
And he struck a deal
with Lori Greiner.
It's 58%, $200,000.
Take it or leave it.
I came here to make a deal.
Let's do it.
Let's see how Byron
and cordaroy's is doing now.
YOUNG: I never expected
to go on "Shark Tank"
and give up 58%
of my business.
