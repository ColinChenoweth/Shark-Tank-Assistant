I can't follow you down
this path to hell,
Hi. My name is Pat Yates.
My company is Happy Feet,
All right!
YATES: There we go.
These are amazing.
They're like moon boots.
Absolutely.
They're like moon boots.
Exactly.
CUBAN: I used to have
a pair of moon boots.
Wow.
HERJAVEC:
They're so comfortable!
Wow.
They really are.
See? Look at that.
Wow.
Look how good he looks
in those sharks.
HERJAVEC: Wow. Why are these
so comfortable, pat?
Well, it is -- it's that 1-inch
foam rubber bottom.
It's a dense foam rubber
that we put in them.
Just, the whole thing,
when you step down on it,
it's like walking
on pillows.
So, pat, $375,000 for 15%.
Your sales must be amazing!
We've done $6.5 million
in the last 3 years...
You got to be kidding.
So, pat,
out of the $2.6 million,
what percentage is online?
It's -- actually,
of that $2.6 million,
it was probably
about $2.2 million,
which is
the highest margin portion.
You're selling that
much stuff online? Wow.
Wow.
Pat, that $2.6 million
you sold last year --
what was your profit
on that?
About $600,000.
So, where are you spending
all your money?
Um...
Because with that big
of margins,
you should be making
more than $600,000.
We do a ton of free shipping
at our busiest time,
which is holiday, which knocks
that margin down significantly.
But the problem was, the margin
pat, you're killing it!
Well -- right!
CORCORAN:
Pat, time out for a moment.
There's something that's
really disturbing me.
You know, it feels to me
as though you may have peaked
or are maybe
even on the way down.
But it feels to me you're not
going to get bigger. I'm out.
I mean --
pat, look, you --
great business, right?
I'm an intense entrepreneur,
Robert.
Oh, my friend,
I get that from you.
This is
a real business.
Right.
You've done
a fantastic job.
Pat, I-I don't see
where I add value.
I like to add value.
I'm a good operator,
just like you are.
I like to run things.
I like to add value to people.
I don't like to just write
a check to something.
Let me ask you
one other question,
one thing
I was gonna talk about.
Look, I-I don't want you
to waste all your time with me.
You're doing a great job.
pat, three sharks
are out now.
All roads lead back.
You know,
I-I-I really appreciate that.
Um, I don't think it's
the right situation for me.
I really appreciate
the offer, but...
Hallelujah.
The only thing that I could do
is maybe counter back.
I really want you all --
what is your counter?
NARRATOR:
Three sharks are out.
which pat feels
is too steep.
What is your counter?
I would be willing to do
$375,000 for 20%,
Pat's selling me!
...$375,000 for 30%,
pat, I'll take
that deal.
Wait. We didn't hear it.
I'm a big guy.
Whoa, whoa! Wait.
$375,000, 25%.
Do we have a deal?
Wait.
Done.
Done! I like you, pat!
CORCORAN: Wow. Bam.
Wham, bam,
thank you, Ma'am.
Great job!
Well, we were talking.
We shouldn't have been talking.
There you have it.
CORCORAN: Wow!
That was
a great presentation.
Thank you.
Appreciate it, guys.
Robert,
that was a great move!
CORCORAN: Wow, Robert.
He sees us talking.
You deserve to lose it.
Don't turn your back
in the tank.
Good job, Robert.
Why, thank you, Mark.
You can learn a thing or two
from me.
I did on that one.
YATES:
It was incredible, I mean,
especially
to pull Robert back in
