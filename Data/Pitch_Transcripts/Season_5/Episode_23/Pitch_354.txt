Both of us are offering $2--
for 25%.
Three sharks versus two.
We can make a lot of calls.
Are you guys willing
to come down to 25%?
Oh, forget them!
I don't think so.
We add so much extra value.
CUBAN: Well, here -- here's the
other thing I'll throw in.
The difference between us
and the girls
is that I actually own
businesses that I can
place orders for.
Are you sick?
What business do you own?
We own a lot of businesses!
I can place orders.
How do you know
what Barb and I own?
I can place orders.
CORCORAN:
I'm in real estate,
and let me tell you what
I'll throw into the deal.
that's right.
I'm the most influential
real-estate broker
in the country,
the most visible,
the most influential.
I'll be your front man
and make sure
every real-estate broker
in America considers
buying these signs.
That's just me ordering five
just right off the top.
And I'm gonna sell
probably 50,000 of them
within 6 months.
well, that's -- I'll look at it
for naked pizza.
I'll definitely buy it
for the mavs.
'cause what'll happen is if I
put it in front of the arena
with a dirk head up there,
it's gonna become a landmark.
People are gonna come
and take their pictures with it
and post it everywhere.
GREINER:
I have relationships
with some of the major retailers
in our country,
and some of them
have 3,500 stores, so...
CORCORAN: And Mark is talking
about five signs.
Who are the --
who are those retailers?
Walmart. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Walgreens.
We all work
with the same retailers.
O'LEARY: Come on!
Mine are bigger,
and mine have done more.
You don't think they return
our calls? Are you kidding?
What do you want to do?
Now's the time to decide.
But I understand partnering
with a shark
isn't a bad thing
for this online business,
because together, we could
probably sell a ton more.
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
I'll give you $375,000,
and I want a $3 royalty
on every pair sold
until I get
my $375,000 back.
[ laughter ]
Chimed right in.
Let's see him
make an offer.
He likes to make
a lot of noise
but doesn't often make
an offer.
no, it just --
I want a 5% -- as I like to say,
"wet my beak" -- equity,
just so we can say
we're partners.
And I'll -- after I recoup
my capital, I'll drop down
to $1.50.
That's three times more
than Snooki got!
Look. I love Snooki,
but you got Mr. Wonderful here.
That's a whole
different ballgame.
GREINER: I like it.
I might offer to go in with
Kevin, if he would have me...
If you can convince me,
because I like to go bigger.
I think it would be great
if you could expand into retail.
So, Lori, I just want
to confirm something.
Okay.
You want to go 50/50
on the deal.
Yes.
One modification
we have to make --
I believe that decimals
are bad karma,
so you have to go up to 6%
on the "wet your beak" equity.
[ laughs ]
So it's 3% each, okay?
We give him $375,000.
We split that.
And your one covenant is
that he attempt retail again.
Yes.
I am prepared to go on there
and Snooki it out.
Snooki it out, huh?
Well, who needs Snooki
when you got pookie?
I think Mark should jump
all over this.
Mark, I-I hope
that you see the passion.
I mean, I've heard you talk
about entrepreneurs.
And you sold garbage bags,
right?
Door to door.
I have -- I have a story,
if you'd give me two minutes.
Sure.
My mom passed away
a year and a half ago
really kind of unexpectedly,
and this was
her favorite story of me.
I had a guy, a kid --
when I was playing basketball
in the backyard with a kid,
his dad was throwing
some calendars out.
I looked at them.
They were last year's calendars.
I took those, and I literally
walked my way home
and sold every one
of those calendars.
The retail
does have challenges,
but I'm gonna get up
every day
to make sure this business
continues to grow.
You -- you do not
have to sell me.
You are the real deal,
right?
I appreciate that.
You've got a great business,
but it's not a fit for me.
I'm out.
I appreciate that, Mark.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Well!
GREINER: [ laughs ]
He was out for a while,
but now he's offering you...
But since partnering with Lori,
she has taken me to levels
that I never even dreamed of.
The orders came pouring in.
In less than 8 months, we've
done over $3 million in sales.
Those aren't projections.
Those are real numbers.
This might just be the ultimate
gift this holiday season.
We recently debuted
cordaroy's on QVC,
and sales went
through the roof.
We did
about $25,000 per minute,
and we oversold our inventory
by 50%.
They slapped us
with a big "sold out" sign,
and it was the best night
of my life.
Hi, Byron!
Hey, Lori!
Working with Lori Greiner
has been amazing.
It seems like
she never stops working,
yet she always answers
the phone.
She's the perfect
business partner.
I have great news
  for you today.
We just got another order
  for half a million dollars!
Holy cow!
  yeah!
Roll up your sleeves,
because you're gonna be
  really busy.
I had
a pretty successful business
prior to going on "Shark Tank,"
so I just wasn't sure
if it was the right thing
for me.
But it was the best business
decision I have ever made.
[ duck quacks ]
BICKLEY: Hey, y'all!
I'm Erin bickley, and this is
my friend Jenny Greer,
and we're two sassy Southern
moms living in Macon, Georgia.
There's barely any left
for you.
Hey, don't hog it!
GREER: Don't let
the Southern accent fool you.
When it comes to business,
we're as tough as the peach pit.
My pride and joy.
Erin and I each have three kids,
and we noticed
that our reflections
ain't what they used to be.
It's a Georgia peach...
But it rotted.
[ laughs ]
GREER:
So we searched everywhere
for a solution
to this common problem.
It was nowhere to be found,
so we decided we'd just make it.
BICKLEY: We are on the cusp
of something great,
but the industry we're in
requires so much capital
and so much expertise
to even get to the doors,
much less get them open.
If we don't get a deal from the
sharks, we will be heartbroken.
We've put a lot of blood, sweat,
and tears into this business.
So it's very important to us
that we succeed
and show everyone
that you can have your cake
and eat it, too.
Especially when you're wearing
our product.
Hello, sharks.
I'm Jenny Greer.
And I'm Erin bickley,
and we're from Macon, Georgia.
And we are the head honchos
of Hold Your Haunches.
We are here
asking for $75,000
for a 20% equity stake
in our company.
Hold your haunches is
a fashion trouser
with a fully integrated
shapewear liner.
Our totally unique, chic,
and one-of-a-kind product
offers smoothing
and slimming support
for women of all ages
and stages,
and can be worn
from carpool to cocktails.
A while back,
we were on a walk,
and Jenny was bemoaning
the fact
that despite all efforts
diet- and exercise-wise,
she was unable
to keep her behind
from sagging
below her underpant line...
Ugh!
...Creating what we refer
to as the two-butt effect.
So I said to Erin,
"there has got to be a legging
with a shaper built in!"
to which I replied,
"I can assure you there is not.
I've been in search of this
exact product for over a year."
since we were unable
to find our dream pant
anywhere on this Earth,
we created it.
We married
a chic, modern trouser
to a super-duper
shaping liner,
and Hold Your Haunches
was born.
I'm in the legging,
and Jenny's in the bootcut.
But Hold Your Haunches
is not just about butts.
We shape from muffin top
to belly flop,
saggy cheeks
and saddlebags.
So, sharks, who's ready
to get in our pants?
I-In the picture, is that
the same woman before and after?
It's not me, but --
CORCORAN: Who is it?
It's not you?
Guess who --
guess who that leaves.
Is that you?
Yes!
Is that a real picture?
And that was you before,
and that's you after?
Yes. Yes.
Did you lose weight after?
No, that is
like 5 minutes apart.
No!
And now that I've had
to admit that on TV --
oh, wow. These are strong.
CORCORAN: Wow! Heavy!
I don't think
I have ever felt
a shaper
that is this intense.
And if you'd like --
shaper on steroids.
CORCORAN: Wow.
Wow, that could hold
a lot of heinie in it.
GREINER: This is a shaper
on steroids. Wow.
CUBAN: Holy smokes.
This is
pretty awesome, Barb.
Wow. It must weigh 5 pounds,
these pants.
Barbara, you wear those,
you'll -- you'll have
a blood clot.
I'm wearing them.
[ laughter ]
I'm just disgusted you don't
make a version for men.
BICKLEY: We're going to!
Mark, you could squeeze
in these.
I have a question regarding
the -- the -- the promise
of this nature.
So, let me ask it
to you this way.
Women of certain age that have
a rubenesque figure...
"rubenesque" -- we haven't
heard that in a long time.
Voluptuous.
...And they elect to use
the Hold Your Haunches
lean mean strategy --
this is where I'm
really concerned.
Let's say they meet a single man
that's attracted to the --
okay.
enough, Kevin!
Wait, wait, wait!
Hear me out!
Don't go there.
Let me go there!
Let me go there, because I think
we have to disclose this.
Do not go there.
Let's say they actually go
on that third date,
and then...it's time.
Oh, Kevin.
Now we're facing the truth.
Horrible.
This is a form
of false advertising,
and there should be
litigation!
What about bras, makeup?
HERJAVEC:
Here's the problem.
Who's gonna wear this?
It's gonna be so hot.
It's such
a heavy material.
That's not true.
GREER: It's really not.
BICKLEY: It's not.
It's breathable.
Except for right now.
There's no cotton in it.
It's --
really?
Yes, it's --
you know, honestly,
I-I just have to inform
my fellow male sharks --
'cause I think Barb knows --
women like shapers.
They do.
Every woman wants to look
10 pounds thinner.
If they have muffin-top,
if they have thighs
that they don't like --
whatever it is.
Guys, let me -- let me
simplify things here. Look.
I understand completely
that every tush needs a push.
[ laughs ]
Oh, good one!
That was very good, yeah.
But --
but you're out?
it's not --
but it's not really
my core competency,
so I'm out.
Well, give those
to your wife,
and we'll come do a trunk show
at your house.
that's right.
Erin, I can't see somebody
using it,
'cause it seems
so heavy to me,
which goes to show
I know nothing.
I'm out.
Why is it every time
there's a female product
on this show,
you guys go out right away?
GREINER:
That's right.
We've invested
in many male products.
We give it a chance.
Name one male product.
You say,
"I don't know it enough."
name one male product.
absolutely right.
Scrub daddy.
Go ahead.
That's not a male product!
No, it's -- that's crap.
You're not saying
women need shapers.
You're saying,
"oh, you know what?"
"I don't know anything.
I'm out."
"I don't want to touch that
with a 10-foot pole."
that's what men do -- "I don't
know anything. I'm out."
right.
O'LEARY:
No, I didn't say that.
I know a lot about this.
Okay.
And I'm extremely concerned,
because I think that this
is fraudulent behavior.
I'm all about compliance
and transparency,
and we don't have
any of that.
Wait, wait, wait.
For all the world
to hear...
Yeah.
...If you met a woman
who you thought was dynamite,
and later,
she took those off,
are you telling me
you wouldn't like her?
You know what I'd do?
I'd litigate.
Oh, my God!
[ laughter ]
I can't be a part of this fraud
and false advertising.
Oh, my God.
I'm out.
There's two things
we don't know,
even though they went out
before they ever even heard.
heard.
What do you make it for,
and what do you sell it for?
$18 a pair
to make in Asia.
But door-to-door, $30.
Uh, wholesale for $69
and retail for $139.
Wow.
Now, obviously,
part of this...
Good margins.
...Is also because
we've committed
to smaller quantities.
smaller amount.
What was your profit
on your business last year?
We profited about $50,000
that we put all back
into the business.
That's great.
So that's 30%.
Can you tell us
about the sales so far?
We have sold a total
of $280,000 worth.
And in what period of time?
We sold our first pair online
in November of 2010.
And how -- what were your sales
in only the last 12 months?
$165,000.
I would like to make
an offer with Barb
just so that, down the road,
we could show our male sharks...
Absolutely.
...How they missed out
on something
that could be one of the biggest
sellers of this season.
I know I will get this
on QVC,
and I know the women,
our customers,
would appreciate it
like crazy.
And I also think
that Barb and I together
will get it into retailers
across the country.
So, Barb, what do you
think of this?
Well, why don't we talk
behind their back?
We give them --
because the truth is,
I'd like to get a good deal.
Okay.
Do you mind stepping out
for a minute, ladies?
Go ahead.
I see this two ways.
Number one -- I see it
as a little bit of a challenge
for us
against our male sharks...
Oh, we are gonna succeed
just to show you guys.
I have zero interest in this.
...Because I would love
to show them how this
becomes a million-dollar
business immediately.
So, that's like me
saying to you, "why don't
you do technology deals?
You never do technology
deals. Why don't you do
technology deals?"
we do technology deals.
You're fools. Miss it.
CUBAN: I don't know.
Be careful what you offer.
I might come in,
just to prove a point.
Don't do that.
They were asking 20%.
Now, you and I both know
that we have to do a lot of
work to get it out there.
I'm not getting up for 10%
on this deal.
I'll tell you, I --
okay. What -- what would you
like to ask for?
CUBAN: I don't know.
Be careful what you offer.
All right, you can come
back in, ladies!
HERJAVEC:
I don't know.
GREINER: Okay, so,
here's our offer.
Our offer
is $75,000 for 40%.
What kind of greed
is this?
Barb and I together,
so you know we will help
get you into everywhere.
You know --
there's a very important piece,
though,
that she also wants
to mention.
Yes. A $100,000 credit line,
as well.
Over the -- over the cash,
because you're gonna need it.
Over it, to help fulfill
the purchase orders.
That's our offer.
Sold.
And we take it.
There!
We accept!
They like that. Mark, we didn't
hear you say anything.
CORCORAN: We should've asked
for more.
Okay.
These are the women
that can take us
where we need to go.
Yes!
There we go, Barb.
And we're on the ground,
girls.
Yeah, we will make you
so happy.
You're a loser. You're a loser.
You're a loser.
These are awesome.
I can't wait to try them on.
Yay!
I think they look awesome.
Oh, thank you so much!
I'm so excited!
I'm hot. She's hot.
She's hot.
She's hot. We're hot.
We're hot. We're hot.
Your head's gonna explode.
You're not. You're not.
[ laughs ]
You go, girl.
Kevin and I are gonna start
our own line -- tush push.
[ laughter ]
BICKLEY:
It feels so great
to be validated
by these women.
And our customers
have known what we have,
and now two expert,
genius businesswomen
recognized immediately
what Hold Your Haunches has.
GREER: It's just the answer
to all our prayers.
It's gonna be
a game-changer.
