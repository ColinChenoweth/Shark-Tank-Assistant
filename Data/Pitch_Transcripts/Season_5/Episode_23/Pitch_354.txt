My name is Sanjiv Patel
from Dallas, Texas,
Oh, thank you, Sanjiv.
...That would be great --
you're welcome.
Yeah.
Here, Lori.
Just grab...
Okay. Wow.
Thank you for that.
You're welcome.
These have a kick to them,
Sanjiv.
Yes, thank you.
Which one did you try?
I tried the El --
cheddarales.
Yeah.
[ chuckles ]
Wow. Ah! Spicy!
O'LEARY: Can I ask you
just a basic question?
Sure.
$500,000 for 30%
imputes a value
of close to $1 1/2 million,
or just over, actually.
yes.
What were your sales
last year, Sanjiv?
So, as of the last 12 months,
it's $300,000.
We had some -- it should --
it's flat.
Well, when we started
this company,
we had a couple of big-box
retailers, the discount stores,
that just bought a ton
of product, right?
Okay.
So, you know, it -- it skews
the figures earlier higher.
Now you're normalizing sales
at how much a year?
We're gonna end this year
at about $350,000.
That's where I'm shooting for,
gross sales.
Okay. How much you gonna make
on the $350,000?
We won't make money
this year.
So, why would you be worth
$1 1/2 million?
Because, with -- with
half a million dollars
from the sharks, right,
so...
Yeah, but -- but hang on.
Hang on.
You have a commodity
in peanuts.
I can buy peanuts.
I can flavor peanuts.
I can dry-roast peanuts.
PATEL: That's the piece
you're buying into.
The only thing of value here
is the brand!
Um, well --
I'm never heard of Mr.
"pardon my flavor" nut bar.
Lord levington.
Lord levington.
What's his name?
GREINER: Levington.
Lord nut.
I don't know who this guy is,
Sanjiv,
that's a great answer.
I'm right here.
Where am I going?
I'm alive. I'm surviving.
Yeah, but can you give me
an operator in the peanut space
in the last 10 years
that has survived
the slaughter fest
from the big guys?
Why does it have
to be in peanuts? Any
small-food business.
What the hell is this?!
Any small-food business.
PATEL: Just because it
hasn't happened,
do you lose faith in
everything happening
from here forward?
Yes, I lose faith!
He loses faith
in everything.
You're a financial guy.
You're a financial guy.
You know what?
Of course
I'm a financial guy!
Doesn't it say --
doesn't it say past results
are no reflection
of future performance?
Isn't that right?
I also say
don't be an idiot
Sanjiv,
I have a question.
Yes.
You didn't, uh,
mention earlier
how you developed
all these flavors.
Yeah.
Did you cook them up
yourself?
Yeah, I'm not a cook.
I'm not a chef.
So, Sanjiv, I love --
unlike Kevin, I really like
disruptive technologies.
So I have no problem
with the market
that you're going into.
Mm.
But I didn't hear
the plan.
I didn't hear anything
that makes me want
to spend
half a million dollars
CUBAN:
Sanjiv, here's my problem.
What you haven't talked to
is sales velocity, right?
Yes.
Here's your chance right now
to tell me
here's why they're flying off
the shelves,
or here's why they will,
because that's the missing
piece, so tell me.
We're bringing
a different shade of product
Good luck, Sanjiv.
Thank you. Bye.
Great guy.
Lovely man.
PATEL: Great opportunity.
Loved being here.
