My name is Sanjiv Patel
from Dallas, Texas,
and my product is
Lord Nut Levington Peanuts.
I'm here today
seeking $500,000
in exchange for 30%
of my company.
So, a bit
about this handsome chap.
Who is Lord nut levington?
Urban legend has it that
Lord nut hails from blighty,
an unsavory land far, far away
across the great pond,
known for its extreme blandness
and lack of flavor.
When he could stand it
no longer,
Lord nut decided upon
a self-imposed exile
and set out for the exciting,
new world in search of flavor.
Later, Lord nut found
his true calling in life --
to fight bland where it hides
and bring freedom of flavor
to the masses.
But before I go on any further,
please take a moment,
tickle your taste buds,
and try some
of our highly seasoned peanuts.
HERJAVEC:
[ chuckles ]
hi, Robert.
if you'd just grab
one of those trays
there...
Oh, thank you, Sanjiv.
...That would be great --
you're welcome.
Yeah.
Here, Lori.
Just grab...
Okay. Wow.
Thank you for that.
You're welcome.
These have a kick to them,
Sanjiv.
Yes, thank you.
Which one did you try?
I tried the El --
cheddarales.
Yeah.
[ chuckles ]
Wow. Ah! Spicy!
O'LEARY: Can I ask you
just a basic question?
Sure.
$500,000 for 30%
imputes a value
of close to $1 1/2 million,
or just over, actually.
yes.
So you must have
some great sales
and distribution, right?
We have some sales, yes.
I launched the brand
in April of 2011.
As of the end of last month,
we've made $700,000
in sales...
Wow.
...Which is the equivalent
of 300,000 cans of peanuts.
What were your sales
last year, Sanjiv?
So, as of the last 12 months,
it's $300,000.
We had some -- it should --
it's flat.
Well, when we started
this company,
we had a couple of big-box
retailers, the discount stores,
that just bought a ton
of product, right?
Okay.
So, you know, it -- it skews
the figures earlier higher.
Now you're normalizing sales
at how much a year?
We're gonna end this year
at about $350,000.
That's where I'm shooting for,
gross sales.
Okay. How much you gonna make
on the $350,000?
We won't make money
this year.
So, why would you be worth
$1 1/2 million?
Because, with -- with
half a million dollars
from the sharks, right,
so...
Yeah, but -- but hang on.
Hang on.
You have a commodity
in peanuts.
I can buy peanuts.
I can flavor peanuts.
I can dry-roast peanuts.
PATEL: That's the piece
you're buying into.
The only thing of value here
is the brand!
Um, well --
I'm never heard of Mr.
"pardon my flavor" nut bar.
Lord levington.
Lord levington.
What's his name?
GREINER: Levington.
Lord nut.
I don't know who this guy is,
and the rest of America
doesn't, either.
But we're gonna get there.
Really?
And we're on our way. Yes.
CUBAN: So, what are you
doing to get there?
So, why do you say
that you're on your way?
Currently, we're in
about 600 stores across the U.S.
What kind of stores?
Mainly down
the middle of America.
We're in Wegmans
in the Northeast.
Great company.
We just got into --
well, earlier this year --
into h-e-b in south Texas.
And have they reordered?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
How much have you invested?
Get ready. $1.1 million.
GREINER: Wow.
Wow!
HERJAVEC: Where did you
get the $1.1 million,
if you can legally
tell me?
So -- [ laughs ]
I can legally tell you.
[ chuckles ]
I came over to the U.S.,
did my M.B.A. at Babson College
in Boston,
known for entrepreneurship.
it's a great school.
When I graduated, I joined
what was then a fledgling
pita chip company,
Stacy's pita chip company,
and I was in charge
of the money.
That's
a very strong brand.
When I -- it is now.
When I joined, we were
about $2 million in sales.
In that journey,
you must remember the days
when you were trying to
get permanent shelf space
for that brand.
Yes.
It's so prohibitive in a
commodity like peanuts or snacks
to get space and keep it,
that you have to have scale
to remain profitable.
You are going to have
to replace
some linear footage
in major retailers...
Yes.
...Against a guy
that has 80% of the market.
In fact, in our industry,
it is very common
that entrepreneurs,
people like me, create brands.
It is the role
of the multinationals,
the larger companies,
to then scale those brands.
That's why we have a thriving
food entrepreneurial industry...
Well said.
...That creates products --
but you have to survive
until you have a --
Sanjiv,
that's a great answer.
I'm right here.
Where am I going?
I'm alive. I'm surviving.
Yeah, but can you give me
an operator in the peanut space
in the last 10 years
that has survived
the slaughter fest
from the big guys?
Why does it have
to be in peanuts? Any
small-food business.
What the hell is this?!
Any small-food business.
PATEL: Just because it
hasn't happened,
do you lose faith in
everything happening
from here forward?
Yes, I lose faith!
He loses faith
in everything.
You're a financial guy.
You're a financial guy.
You know what?
Of course
I'm a financial guy!
Doesn't it say --
doesn't it say past results
are no reflection
of future performance?
Isn't that right?
I also say
don't be an idiot
and invest
where you can't win.
How about
my pork barrel bbq guys?
Yes.
They were
at $500,000 in sales.
It took them a year and a half
to get there,
and then it caught fire,
and now they're over $2 million
in sales.
Yeah.
And you know why?
Every doomsdayer
that said to them
they wouldn't do it,
they ignored,
like this character
over here.
You're doing it
in barbecue sauce.
GREINER:
And you know what?
It's just the same
as peanuts?
Listen, you're just taking
the guy down
and making him feel
like he can't do this.
I'm not finished
taking him down!
Sanjiv,
I have a question.
Yes.
You didn't, uh,
mention earlier
how you developed
all these flavors.
Yeah.
Did you cook them up
yourself?
Yeah, I'm not a cook.
I'm not a chef.
I can't mix things up and say,
"here's a great recipe."
you know, that's the missing
piece for me --
passion for the product.
I almost feel like you're
a left-brain --
how could you not hear
the passion for the product?
he's got it all over.
CORCORAN: He's got cute names,
but I haven't heard
any love of your peanuts
from you at all.
Forgive me, but every
food business I've
gotten involved in...
Well --
...that was front and center,
and I'm not getting it.
I'm out.
So...Here's my feeling.
I couldn't try
your peanuts,
because peanuts
don't agree with me.
oh.
Because I can't even eat
your product
or even try it,
I'm out.
I understand. Thank you.
So, Sanjiv, I love --
unlike Kevin, I really like
disruptive technologies.
So I have no problem
with the market
that you're going into.
Mm.
But I didn't hear
the plan.
I didn't hear anything
that makes me want
to spend
half a million dollars
to help you build the brand
going forward.
I-I got to be out.
CUBAN:
Sanjiv, here's my problem.
What you haven't talked to
is sales velocity, right?
Yes.
Here's your chance right now
to tell me
here's why they're flying off
the shelves,
or here's why they will,
because that's the missing
piece, so tell me.
We're bringing
a different shade of product
into this category
with a fun, exciting brand
that people
feel passionate about.
There is no water-cooler
talk happening about
those other products.
There's no water-cooler
talk talking about
Lord nut levington.
Well, people get
quite -- people are excited
when they try our product.
That's -- see, now you went
from giving data
to talk
and giving stories.
I don't see it
as blowing out the doors,
and I don't think this is enough
capital to correct mistakes.
Your problem is sales not flying
off the shelf. I'm out.
Okay. I respect that.
Thank you.
Are we done?
Is that everyone?
That's everyone.
We're done big-time.
[ laughs ]
It's lovely to meet you.
Good luck, Sanjiv.
Thank you. Bye.
Great guy.
Lovely man.
PATEL: Great opportunity.
Loved being here.
Now I'm gonna go out
there and fight bland
and sell some peanuts.
That's what I count on.
I'm gonna give the guy
a ton of credit,
because he came in
and kicked Kevin's butt.
yeah!
He -- he did, and he does have
a passion and drive.
I don't know
about that, Mark.
If I was wrong, Mark,
he would be covered in offers.
And look. Oh, oh, oh!
He didn't get any offers!
CUBAN: But no, he --
you're just in a lousy mood
today. it's terrible.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur
from Louisville, Kentucky,
with a product he believes
is like a vacation
for your feet.
