Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
All right,
well, thanks, Kevin.
We appreciate your time.
No problem.
JOHN: Unlike Kevin,
My name is Stan Krozel.
This is my partner,
Kevin Ullery.
We're from sugar grove,
Illinois,
Stan's the brains.
I'm the beauty.
I was very successful
in real estate,
but when
the real-estate market crashed,
it changed everything.
Watching Stan
have to shut the doors
for the last time
was devastating.
It was the hardest thing
that we've been through
together for sure.
How do you
like these colors?
I think it looks good.
We've always gotten along
very well,
so we thought
it would be fun
to start a new business
venture together.
Our product is unique
because every experience
is one of a kind,
Here's to building
a new future, Stan.
Sounds good.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Stan Krozel.
Stan, so, what
do you pay the mall?
Malls are basically
individually negotiated leases.
Well, you know, when Stan first
approached me about this
ULLERY: We will not
let you down.
All right,
let's sell some tickets.
Congrats, guys.
We're gonna sell lots
of tickets, guys.
Thank you so much.
Thank you all
for your audience.
Congratulations.
You bo-bos did
all that thinking,
Kevin made you an offer --
$75,000 for 25%.
If Lori goes in with him,
you're giving up 50% of your
business to get your $150,000.
You got to make
a decision here.
I would like you, Kevin,
to go in with me...
O'LEARY: Right.
...Because
this is good product.
Would you go 40%?
No.
20%/20%?
No,
it's a partnership 50/50.
Half the work is here.
That's the way
I look at it.
The immense amount of work
it's gonna take
to actually bring this
to market,
it's weighing
on my shoulders now.
Lori, Kevin's firm --
$75,000 for 25%.
What are you --
what are you doing?
Are you in on that deal?
Yes, but it doesn't sound
like he's in on that.
All right.
We don't know,
so the offer
on the table right now
to clarify it,
you get two sharks.
Each of them want 25%
because of the weight of work
ahead of us.
