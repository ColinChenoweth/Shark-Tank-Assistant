is an innovative service

Hello, sharks.
and as you've been standing
here, you didn't do that.
I find there's
so much confusion.
I'm out.
All right.
Appreciate it, man.
Thank you.
Darn it.
I don't know if I want some guy
who was in a rock band
coming to my house
to teach my daughter how
to play an instrument.
[ laughs ]
Well, hey, man,
we gave it all we got.
It's their loss.
All right,
well, thanks, Kevin.
We appreciate your time.
No problem.
JOHN: Unlike Kevin,
I enjoy the great outdoors
a lot, and I know roughing it.
So when I go out and I rough it
with my Range Rover,
my computers,
and my cable TV...
[ Greiner laughs ]
...My masseuse, and
my pop-up McDonald's store,
I really -- I really
understand the value of that,
but I just don't see
the market for that.
This business is too small
for me to invest in.
I'm out.
GREINER: I see you
in an early phase...
My name is Stan Krozel.
This is my partner,
Kevin Ullery.
We're from sugar grove,
Illinois,
and we live
with our dog, Max.
ULLERY: Stan and I met
when we were 25 years old,
and it really was
love at first sight.
He is
very business-oriented.
I'm a lot more laid-back.
Stan's the brains.
I'm the beauty.
I was very successful
in real estate,
but when
the real-estate market crashed,
it changed everything.
And we needed to find
a new business to get into
to bring in the cash flow
we needed.
Watching Stan
have to shut the doors
for the last time
was devastating.
It was the hardest thing
that we've been through
together for sure.
How do you
like these colors?
I think it looks good.
We've always gotten along
very well,
so we thought
it would be fun
to start a new business
venture together.
Our product is unique
because every experience
is one of a kind,
and we're paving the way
to new adventures.
To get this business going,
we risked everything.
We risked
all of our finances.
Even our relationship
was put to the test.
Here's to building
a new future, Stan.
Sounds good.
We've experienced firsthand
the pain of losing a business,
so this new company is our way
of getting back on track.
So, if things don't go our way
in the tank,
this could be the end
of the road for us.
[ train horn honking ]
[ children talking excitedly ]
[ bell ringing ]
Oh, Lord.
Oh. [ chuckles ]
oh, that is so cool.
JOHN: Hey! They got
little people in there!
Hey!
Hey!
[ laughter ]
Hey!
[ chuckles ]
Aww.
CHILD: Hey!
Lori, let's hop on.
[ laughs ]
Hi.
CUBAN: Hi.
[ laughter ]
Bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Hello, sharks.
My name is Stan Krozel.
And my name
is Kevin Ullery.
We're from Chicago,
Illinois.
Yay.
Our company
is Fun Time Express.
We are seeking
a $125,000 investment
in exchange for a 20% equity
stake in our businesses.
Sharks, we want you to take
a trip down memory lane.
Think back to those days
in your childhood
when mom and dad would take you
along for a trip to the mall
when you were dragged
from store to store,
stuck in an endless loop
of rejection and boredom.
"dad, can I get
some ice cream?"
"no."
"mom, can I go
to the toy store?"
"no, here's some money.
"why don't you ride
the merry-go-round
while I get myself
a new pair of shoes?"
[ snaps fingers ]
and there
you find yourself,
sitting on a dirty,
plastic horse,
going in circles
on a trip to nowhere.
That's the problem.
Most malls offer
the same old attractions.
Well, sharks, we've broken
the confinement barrier.
We want you to relive
your childhood
and imagine what trips
to the mall would've been like
with a ride on...
BOTH: The Fun Time Express!
That's right.
Fun time express
is a trackless train ride
for all ages.
And we travel
through the entire mall,
so it gives dads a chance
to take a break,
moms a chance
to window-shop,
and shopping malls
are just the beginning.
Our trains
are built and equipped
to handle any event
or environment, like parks,
amusement parks, sports arenas,
even private parties.
Thank you, sharks. We are ready
for your questions.
Is this
an existing business?
Is this
a brand-new start-up?
We currently have
five operational trains.
Actually, a sixth one
was placed online
a couple of weeks ago.
This will be our lucky
number seven.
Walk us through
how I make money.
Monday through Thursday,
it's like virtually
most retail businesses.
Friday and Saturday,
basically,
we can have
several hundred dollars,
even $500 to $800
on a weekend.
That's it --
500 bucks in two days?
What does it cost?
That sucks!
What -- what is...
Is it a nickel
to ride it?
[ laughs ]
No, it's $3
to ride a train.
What's the capital expenditure
to buy the train?
Each train
is about $37,500.
Believe it or not,
six to eight months
is the expected
projected time
to pay off a train in full
from net proceeds.
HERJAVEC: Stan, do you --
correct, and that's
the beauty about it.
There's limited overhead.
Stan, so, what
do you pay the mall?
Malls are basically
individually negotiated leases.
Last year, what did you gross,
and what was your net?
Well, we started in 2011.
We've sold 31,000 tickets.
So you did about $95,000?
We did about $106,000
in gross revenues.
About $47,000
was net profits.
Okay.
In 2012, we doubled.
We actually went to about
62,000 in ticket sales.
We went to about $216,000
in gross revenues,
and we went to a little over
$80,000 roughly in net profits.
Next year, with all seven
trains fully operational,
we're projecting at selling
over 300,000 tickets.
GREINER: $3 a ride.
I'm just curious where
you picked that number from.
$3 seems
to be the magic number.
In November, December,
like many stores do,
you could boost up
to one ticket for $5,
two for $8,
three for $10,
and we have done that
in one mall.
Yeah, look, you've got
constrained capacity.
You've got 24
or 28 seats, right?
Absolutely.
And so your ability
to change your prices
expands by the traffic
in the mall.
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
So variable pricing
is the wave of the future.
I'm glad
you're on top of it.
But the bigger issue is,
it's not really
a scalable business, right?
It's tough to grow this.
You could add more malls.
Well, of course
you get more malls,
but then the more malls
you get,
the more people you need
to manage them,
the more people
you have to manage,
all the people
you have driving the trains,
maintaining the trains.
Even though I realize
over multiple years,
it might be a nice little income
for an individual operator,
from an investor's perspective
who's looking to get a return
in addition to what
you're looking to get,
that makes it
more difficult,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
JOHN: You know, I grew up --
I grew up riding trains
a lot as a kid,
but they were the f-trains, so,
you know, I would get on there.
I was flashed by a vagrant,
my pockets would be picked,
and I'd have bedbugs by the time
I'd get off the train.
[ laughter ]
Yeah.
Ew!
Oh, boy.
Ew.
That was the f train --
New York City.
So, I want to believe in this.
But I took my kids on something
like this at the carnival,
right?
By the time I was done,
both of my kids
were playing online poker
on their smartphones.
They couldn't care less.
It's just not a model for me.
I'm out.
We understand.
Thank you for the audience.
We appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
O'LEARY: What every shark
is struggling with
is a scalability
and the actual return.
I mean,
it's -- it's sort of --
you came in too early
is what he's saying.
It's one of these deals
that I'm tempted,
but it's too small.
It just --
but the -- but that's
the idea, is we --
you know, where is the world
domination of the mall?
[ laughter ]
Let's not limit it
to malls.
We can take these anywhere.
That's why we need you.
You know,
I think -- I get it.
It's interesting.
It's small.
The train is small.
The deal is small.
The returns are small.
I like to think big.
Well,
let's think big together.
Big, big, big, big, big, big.
This train can grow.
100 locations.
Basically, if we did absolutely
nothing all next year,
that's $150,000 net profit
that's passive income,
Mr. wonderful.
You love
to invest in stocks.
No, look, I like it.
Think of it that way.
There's a little concern
about economies
in different regions,
but the model basically works.
It's not bad.
It's just small.
HERJAVEC: Here's the great
thing about your business.
You're making a pretty steady
stream of income.
I think this is a great
business for you guys,
but it's too small
for an investor.
I'm out.
Guys, look,
I'm very tempted
because back-of-my-envelope
calculations,
you're making about 20% return
on the capital.
Probably 25%, 30%.
Give us one
of your crazy proposals.
It's just too small.
It's just too small.
It's just too small.
I'm --
there's small,
and small grows to big.
You started out small, too,
and look where you're at today.
What are you gonna do?
I'm suffering,
I'm suffering!
CUBAN:
You're killing me, smalls!
I'm suffering
listening to you!
Okay, okay, look, guys, it's too
small for Mr. Wonderful.
I'm out.
Thank you
for your consideration.
Oh, my gosh, that train
finally left the station.
[ laughing ] Yeah.
[ laughs ]
I'm thinking about this
'cause I like what you're doing
in that you're bringing
something to the malls
that's different.
You're kind of bringing back
something that's fun for kids,
and parents can do it
with them.
It's like a feel-good,
nice kind of business...
And it is, Lori.
...To have.
Thank you
for saying because --
not -- go ahead.
Well, you know, when Stan first
approached me about this
and said, "well, Kev, we're
gonna drive choo-choo trains
in the mall"...
[ Herjavec laughs ]
...I was a little apprehensive
to say the least.
[ laughs ]
But then once
I went to the mall...
You have to see it
in person to appreciate it.
...And saw it in person,
it's exactly what you said.
There was just such a level
of joy associated with it,
and we were going through
a pretty rough time.
Um...
I just think, you know,
it would be so wonderful to get
one of you guys behind us.
May I say one thing?
We are willing to do
100% return.
Every dollar that we make
from the sale of tickets,
every dollar would go towards
paying that debt in full.
Then thereafter,
you would get 20%.
That's interesting to me.
So, here's my offer.
I'm gonna offer you half,
but I'm gonna need
another shark in with me.
Okay.
I'd like Mr. Wonderful,
my buddy here,
because of connections,
and he fits.
[ sighs ] You're wrestling
with this, man.
Yeah, I am 'cause it's
actually not a bad business.
All right, Stan and Kev,
the offer is this.
You get $125,000,
you have two sharks,
and we are going to get 20%
of the whole business,
and we'll grow this together
with you.
There are some metrics
I want to work on,
I want to tweak with you.
We can make more money
than you're making.
What do you say, guys?
Absolutely,
we would be honored.
We would love to do business
with both of you.
And we want a dining car.
Yes.
All right.
And you will get
your dining car.
[ laughter ]
Thank you.
Fantastic.
Thank you all
for your attention.
It's a good thing
to be doing.
Beautiful presentation.
ULLERY: We will not
let you down.
All right,
let's sell some tickets.
Congrats, guys.
We're gonna sell lots
of tickets, guys.
Thank you so much.
Thank you all
for your audience.
Congratulations.
You bo-bos did
all that thinking,
and you didn't even
negotiate.
No, don't worry.
'cause we're getting
our money back.
[ train horn honking ]
[ laughs ]
[ bell ringing ]
[ laughing ] Yes!
We're excited, America.
We're gonna bring
a trackless train
in every mall in America.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a firefighter
with an invention
to prevent costly damage
for homes and business.
Kevin made you an offer --
$75,000 for 25%.
If Lori goes in with him,
you're giving up 50% of your
business to get your $150,000.
You got to make
a decision here.
Well, Lori, she hasn't clarified
where she stands. She dropped --
yeah, Lori,
are you in on that?
I would like you, Kevin,
to go in with me...
O'LEARY: Right.
...Because
this is good product.
Would you go 40%?
No.
20%/20%?
No,
it's a partnership 50/50.
Half the work is here.
That's the way
I look at it.
The immense amount of work
it's gonna take
to actually bring this
to market,
it's weighing
on my shoulders now.
Lori, Kevin's firm --
$75,000 for 25%.
What are you --
what are you doing?
Are you in on that deal?
Yes, but it doesn't sound
like he's in on that.
All right.
We don't know,
so the offer
on the table right now
to clarify it,
you get two sharks.
Each of them want 25%
because of the weight of work
ahead of us.
I-I do understand the deal.
I thank you, and I cannot do 50%
of my business at this time.
CUBAN: Thank you.
Thank you.
Great idea.
Thank you.
I understand there's a lot
of work that needs to be done
moving forward,
but I anticipate doing that,
and I will take help,
but I just couldn't do 50%.
It's just too much.
