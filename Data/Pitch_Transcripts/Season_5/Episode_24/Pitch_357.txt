And as you can see,
in a matter of seconds,
you're making power.
Wow.
The Powerpot is
an incredible innovation
that is a simple
cooking vessel
that now doubles as
a mini renewable power plant.
Who wants to join our team
and keep charging?
Pretty cool, guys.
Can we see the packaging?
Very cool.
Yeah, okay.
You don't need to put water
in it, do you?
Sharks, I'm Matt Scarpuzzi,
and my company is Quickstop
fire sprinkler tools.
I'm seeking $150,000 in exchange
for 10% equity in my company.
What would you do
if the fire sprinklers
above your head right now
started to pour out
an entire bathtub of water
every other minute?
Now, fire sprinklers
are the best way to save lives
and protect property.
The bad news is, every year
in the United States,
accidental activations
of these sprinkler heads
cause billions of dollars
in water damage.
I'm gonna show you
what an activated sprinkler head
looks like.
I want you to imagine this water
pouring out inside your home
or your business.
What you need is a Quickstop
fire sprinkler tool.
With the Quickstop, you're not
just getting an incredible tool.
You're getting
an insurance policy
that protects
your greatest investments
from expensive water damage.
Sharks, I need your help
to keep that water in the ocean
with you where it belongs
and not in our homes
and our businesses.
Can we see one?
Absolutely. I have samples
that I'll bring to you.
And these are
on sprinkler heads,
so you can actually
use them yourself.
Thank you, Matt.
So, this is something
that you normally carry around
as a fireman?
These are on every truck
in the city that I work for,
and, yes, this is a tool
that we use to shut off...
Thanks, Matt.
...Fire sprinkler heads
when we're called to scene.
HERJAVEC: Matt?
Yes?
Walk me
through the premise.
The fire alarm goes off.
The sprinkler system
goes off.
So then we know
it's a false alarm.
Mm-hmm.
Is the premise
that the building guy
would then go to every sprinkler
and turn it off?
That's one of the myths
about fire sprinklers
is that every sprinkler head
goes off.
Only the head that is nearest
to the heat source or the fire
or the one that gets
accidentally hit goes off.
Really?
So, 90 --
I didn't know that.
Yeah, 90% of the time,
if there is a fire,
one sprinkler head goes off,
and most of the time
when they're accidentally hit,
it's usually one.
Can't the building
just turn the water source off
to that part?
[ chuckles ]
If it was only that easy.
I've been on calls where
it has taken over 45 minutes
for the building engineer
to find the shutoff.
GREINER: Yes,
I've experienced that.
That is hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
So, Matt,
you're gonna have to educate
every single potential buyer
about the merits of this tool.
That is a form
of hell on Earth.
Unless it happens to you,
which I had it happen to me,
and black, sludgy water
comes out.
It's not clear water.
And then when that water
comes out,
it stains and ruins everything,
and it floods out,
so it went down floor
after floor after floor,
flooding all the floors
all the way down.
I've literally seen one
sprinkler head on the 32nd floor
of a high-rise.
By the time we got there,
which we were eight blocks away,
it was down
to the parking garage.
So, is your premise that
individuals would buy this,
or will building managers
buy it?
I mean, who are you
gonna sell this to?
Our goal is to sell it
to the 33,000 fire departments
that are in the United States.
But don't
the fire departments
already have a tool
like this?
No, they don't.
They don't?
They don't?
I'm not kidding you.
Before I invented this tool,
I would show up,
and I would feel
utterly useless.
So you have no tool
to turn it off?
We would take
wooden door chalks,
and we would hammer them
together...
Really?
...Inside of the opening.
Tell us about the economics
then, right?
What do they cost to make?
What are you gonna
sell them for?
We have sold almost $18,000
in the last six weeks.
Those cost about $25 each
to manufacture.
What do you sell them for?
They sell for $89.95.
Who were you selling to?
Who did you find
was your customer?
We have sold fire departments,
h.o.a.s, building construction
workers, hospitals.
I like products that get sold
into a very narrow market...
Mm-hmm.
...Because it's easy
to capture,
but I'm trying
to get my head around,
are the departments gonna buy
one for every fireman
or just put one
on the truck?
'cause if it's one
on every truck,
it's not that big a market.
Most of what we're selling to
is one on every engine.
However, the fire department
is one little sliver.
The market that we're selling to
is the people who go in
and install these systems
because they knock them off.
Oh, I see.
Homeowners who have had one
go off above them
because they've suffered the
pain of the water coming down.
Is there a patent on it?
This has a utility patent
that was filed back in may,
and we're still waiting
to hear back from that.
And what are you gonna do
with the $150,000?
I need to buy more parts.
We have a couple orders
that are possibly coming forward
in the thousands,
and I don't have that inventory
on hand right now.
Basically, anybody that has
a fire sprinkler system
should have this tool
in their home,
but getting to them is
a whole different problem.
That brings up a great point,
and that's --
no kidding.
SCARPUZZI: I actually have
a second product.
Ah!
Oh.
And this is our home
fire sprinkler kit.
It is designed
for the homeowner.
It is actually a two-piece tool,
and it not only stops
fire sprinklers,
but it stops other plumbing
leaks around your house.
How does it work?
There is a disposable cartridge
that gets loaded into the handle
of the gun.
This is designed to fit
sprinkler heads,
as well as other plumbing.
So, if you have a sink
like I have here
and you have a hose break...
GREINER:
What about a pipe break?
So, you have this hose that's --
that's pouring water out
or a pipe, a faucet, a tap
between 5/16 and an inch, this
gets inserted into the leak.
Goes up inside, and, basically,
you push the handle
of the tool forward,
which expands the balloon
and locks the cartridge
in place.
But that -- that has existed
for quite some time
where I'm from.
What, that tool?
Yeah, where I'm from.
We would -- we would fold
the holes in half
and put a cinder block
on it.
[ laughs ]
And that's it.
No more leak.
So, let's get back to
the sprinkler head over here.
The challenge with this
is really educational.
I wouldn't even know
where to start with this.
That's the challenge.
Yeah.
CUBAN:
That's not a challenge.
JOHN: Really?
O'LEARY: Okay,
what's the solution, Mark?
Wait, but it's a challenge
for me.
You're gonna go door to door
and sell them to each home?
No.
But I think this is --
"hi. I'm Mark Cuban.
I've solved your problem."
hey, I used to go door to door
selling when I was a kid.
I could.
You're gonna start again?
Yeah, why not?
I have absolutely no knowledge
in how
I can help you with this.
You've come up with an ingenious
product, but I'm out.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Lori, if there was ever
a QVC product...
[ laughs ]
...This has to be it.
Here's my feeling.
You risk your lives
every day to save us,
and now you're doing something
really admirable
in that you're trying
to create a product
that stops damage
in our homes.
And because I think
this is something needed
and really good,
I'm gonna make you an offer.
But I think there's
a lot of risk in it,
so I'm gonna need
another shark in with me.
So, I'm gonna offer you half,
$75,000.
But I'm gonna want 18%.
So they would get 18%,
as well,
so it would be 36% total.
And I think this should be
a consumer product, as well.
But we need to get
one other shark in.
NARRATOR:
One shark is out.
Lori has made a partial offer
but wants another shark
in on the deal.
So, I'm gonna offer you half,
$75,000.
But I'm gonna want 18%.
So they would get 18%,
as well,
so it would be 36% total.
All right, Matt, so, I think
it's a very clever design,
but I disagree with Lori.
I don't see it as
a large consumer product.
I think you will definitely
sell one
to every fire department,
but until you came
out here today,
I didn't realize that you
get false alarms with them.
So I don't see a self-evident
consumer market.
The training challenge is
tremendous to educate people.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
GREINER:
I'm going to clarify.
For me to be invested,
it's the whole kit and caboodle.
It's this
for the sprinkler heads.
It's that for leaking pipes.
It's everything.
It's everything.
It's everything.
Yes.
And --
and it's actually
one more thing.
Oh, great, bring it on.
So, wait, there's more.
Firefighters climb ladders
all day long.
The average person doesn't,
and in order to get up
to the sprinkler head,
how do they get up there
without climbing a ladder?
So, what I did...
Was, I designed a pole,
and the pole actually gets...
[ laughter ]
...The Quickstop talon
into the pole.
It telescopes out over 12 feet,
and anybody like a homeowner
or a maintenance worker
can operate.
That, I think, is brilliant
because you get it
[snaps fingers] fast.
When do you have time
to work?
[ laughs ]
My brain --
You're designing things
all day.
I like your mind.
My brain is always moving.
O'LEARY: Let me declare
my position on this.
Because, you know, I see
the merits of the product,
but I do not see the path
to market.
I think
it's a very challenging one.
The only way
I would do the deal
and be the other $75,000
in Lori's scenario
is if I get 25%.
She can stay at 18%,
but I think the challenge...
[ laughs ]
...Is really horrific.
That's one hell of a fire
you're gonna have to put out.
I would encourage Lori
to go to 25%,
and the partnership
would get 50%...
Oh, Lord.
...Which is what
I think it deserves.
I don't care what Mr. Cuban
says about this.
I think the challenge here
is brutal,
and if you want to step in
and take my $75,000
at a different price,
go ahead and do it.
But I want 25% because
this is not a company.
It's a product.
I do appreciate that offer,
and I agree with part
of what you're saying,
but I do own a company,
and we are starting to establish
lines of distribution.
Matt,
let me ask a question.
Why not, given
the value proposition
that you've discussed
and the hundreds of thousands,
if not millions, of dollars
that can be saved,
why $89?
Why not $299?
Why not $499?
That's a great question.
As a new product,
I put that $89.95 out there
to get a feel for the market,
and you're absolutely right.
We have not had anybody
kick at our price.
People are paying $200
for a sprinkler tool that
can't do what mine does.
Right, so why aren't you
charging $299?
'cause it solves
all your problems.
Because I'm a fireman
and I design tools
and that's what I'm good at.
Therein lies the problem.
And I'm learning this.
JOHN: That's the operator
problem we're talking about.
SCARPUZZI: And I'm learning
this new thing.
O'LEARY: That's why
I want to be commensurate
with the risk inherent here.
the problem is,
you don't have a company.
You're an inventor.
And you have a full-time job
and a full-time obligation,
and so whoever the partner is,
if you get a partner,
is gonna be responsible
for that other side.
So my point is,
I'm not looking to have
to insert that much manpower
to help develop a company.
So my ask
is not unreasonable.
You can decide on that,
but to answer the question,
I'm out.
Thank you.
HERJAVEC: Mark's out.
Damon's out.
Sorry, it's a great idea.
You're gonna be fine,
Matt.
And I really wish you
good luck.
Thanks for your time.
I appreciate it.
CUBAN:
It's a good product.
I think it's an important
and good product,
but I know what we would have
to put into it.
If he raises the price
to $200 or more,
he'll sell a million dollars
worth of product.
HERJAVEC: I agree.
