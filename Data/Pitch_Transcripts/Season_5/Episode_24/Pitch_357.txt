Hi.
I'm David Toledo.
And I'm Caleb Light.
Our company is Power Practical,
creators of the Powerpot.
We're seeking
a $250,000 investment
for 10% equity
in our company.
We know that
just about everyone
knows how to boil
a pot of water
and charge their phone,
but what if I told you
you could charge your phone
from a pot of boiling water?
Our first product
is the Powerpot.
It takes fire and water
and makes power
with no moving parts.
It's a great solution
which we use
to generate portable,
on-demand power
because it works day,
night, rain, or shine.
The best part is,
it's super easy to use.
And I'm gonna show you
how easy it is to use.
You simply take
your Powerpot.
You add water to the pot.
You fire up your stove.
You take your regulator cord.
You plug it into the back.
TOLEDO: You -- you do need
to put water in it.
Why?
So, the Powerpot
is a thermoelectric generator,
which means it takes
a temperature difference
from the bottom
of the pot.
And whatever's inside,
which should be water,
and turns it into electricity
with no moving parts.
So, as the water heats up,
it becomes less efficient
in generating electricity?
Yes. So, as the temperature
difference decreases,
it produces less power.
So, Caleb, how long
would it power something?
The Powerpot output's 5 Watts,
or 1 amp, of current,
so that means 90% of
the USB devices will charge
just as quickly
as at home.
O'LEARY:
Is there anything protected,
or anybody can do this?
So, we filed a patent
in 2010,
and it's been published,
and it's still pending.
I can't even cook a hot dog
in this thing.
[ laughs ]
Like, what's the game plan
size-wise?
So, in terms
of the typical use case
for someone that goes
into the outdoors...
Yeah.
...That's a pot
that's pretty common.
We actually have
larger-style pots.
So, where have you
been selling this set?
So, we initially launched
our company
on a crowd-funding
platform.
Of course.
Which one?
Kickstarter, and --
what did you raise?
We set out to raise 50 grand
in 30 days, and we raised 126.
Okay.
We pre-sold
roughly 1,000 units.
What do you guys want
to do with the money?
So, we want to do
three things.
We want to sell
more product.
We want to get
into more doors,
which we need to hire
a few more people.
Second thing
we want to do is,
we're doing some testing
with some big-box stores,
and so we need to assist
in the sell-through
with some point of sale.
And then the third thing
we want to do is,
we want to continue
to expand our product line.
You're asking for $250,000
for 10%,
and you're valuing
the company at $2.5 million.
Yep.
And you've sold
$300,000 worth of goods.
This year.
This year.
Have you got any orders
from outdoor retailers?
Yeah, we are in over 100
different doors right now.
Beyond a niche product,
how big is this market?
Like, what could
your sales be next year?
We're projecting to be
in the range
of about $2 million
next year.
[ laughter ]
But there
are some solar companies
that are doing tens of millions
of dollars of sales every year.
So, when I was a teenager,
I was a camp counselor,
and I used to take
two-week trips without any food.
We'd go out
into the wilderness.
I have very unfond memories
of that time.
[ laughter ]
And...
[ Herjavec laughs ]
...I hate camping today,
and I have a new rule.
Wherever I sleep,
there's a mint on my pillow.
[ laughter ]
So, I have absolutely
no interest in your deal.
I'm out.
LIGHT: Mm-hmm.
...Of this.
I'm not really sure
how big it's gonna go.
So I'm out.
Well, thanks, Lori.
We appreciate it.
Thank you.
Okay, we have two sharks left,
I believe.
Well, unlike the other
three soft and fluffy sharks...
[ laughter ]
...I do love camping,
and I was a boy scout
for many, many years.
Mm-hmm.
I think
it's a beautiful design,
and the form factor
is perfect for camping.
Everything goes in.
It'll fit in your backpack.
But at
a $2.5-million value...
You're asking
for $250,000 for 10%?
Mm-hmm.
I think
you've already priced it
in the size
of that market.
I don't see a way for me
to participate today.
I'm out.
Okay, thanks, Robert.
And then there was one.
[ sighs ]
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.
Mark Cuban is Powerpot's
last chance for a deal.
And then there was one.
[ laughs ]
CUBAN: Where do you see
the company in three years?
What other applications
do you see for that?
LIGHT:
The emerging markets?
That's a market that we see
could be a huge benefit
on our side, and --
you mean like
third-world application?
TOLEDO: We have Powerpots
in Uganda with a nonprofit.
They're keeping track
of them,
finding out what people
are using them for.
But just their phones,
right? Just being able to --
that's what we thought
it was gonna be.
It was gonna be phones,
but that ends up
not being the case.
What is the case?
In Uganda, because
they have a fire indoor,
they want lights.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
The pot's boiling.
I know.
LIGHT: The pot's boiling.
[ Greiner laughs ]
And it's charging.
Guys, I like
what you're doing.
Um...I like
the social aspects of it.
I just get the sense
that you've got
all the pieces you need.
We see tons of value
in bringing someone like you
to the table.
So, closing a round
with you means
we potentially will never have
to raise money again ever.
Since you guys
are smart [laughs]
I'll offer you
250k for 20%.
For 20%?
Yeah.
Ooh!
Well, Mark,
we have investors
that have already put money up
to the table.
We put a tremendous amount
of value in that.
We feel like that would
not be very good for --
so you see no value in all
the stuff you just said
that was so great about Mark?
is that what you're saying?
No, no, no, no.
I just am saying that --
well, you cut
the value in half.
O'LEARY: But a shark brings
more than just money,
and I think you made
reference to that.
Well, we -- we still see
GREINER: Right.
A lot of value
in bringing on Mark.
You don't see that much.
You only see 10% value.
O'LEARY: There's many
venture-capital firms out there.
There's only one Shark Tank.
So what if we did 12% equity
for $250,000,
plus another 3%
of advisor options
and offer a seat
on our board?
You got a deal.
Whoo! Yeah!
Wow.
If it's a good company,
it's a good company.
Congratulations.
Good job.
Mr. Cuban,
we appreciate it.
They even called you
"Mr. Cuban."
I don't like that.
I like "Mark."
Nice job, guys.
Yeah, boy!
[ grunts ]
Whoo!
Try that again.
HERJAVEC: That was
a good one, Mark.
Good kids.
That was
a really good product.
CUBAN:
It's a good company.
I just hate camping
so much.
[ laughs ]
NARRATOR: On the very first
episode of "Shark Tank,"
Tiffany krummins brought
a homemade prototype
of her children's medicine
dispenser, Ava the elephant,
into the tank, and she struck
a deal with Barbara Corcoran.
You know what?
I'd love to take your offer.
We're gonna make money
on this together.
NARRATOR:
Let's see how she's doing now.
Okay, guys, let's make
these a priority.
KRUMMINS: You know,
I really still can't believe
that Barbara took a gamble
on me that first episode.
Five years ago,
I walked into the Shark Tank
as green as it comes.
I'm trying to play hardball.
Can you tell?
Barbara kind of took me
under her wing
and helped me transform my
prototype into a real product.
All of this happened while
I was battling thyroid cancer.
I truly believe that my business
was a great motivator
to fight cancer and beat it.
Today, I am so happy
and thankful to report
that I am still cancer-free.
The biggest thing
that's happened in my business
is a connection with a company
called healthpons.
Healthpons is so important to me
because they have unlimited
resources and connections
with doctors and hospitals.
They have allowed me
to get into doors
that I could not
get into before.
We already have
confirmed purchase orders
for over $6 million in hospitals
and doctors' offices alone.
Patty, I'm offering you
my entire share
in Ava the elephant.
I would like to offer you
230,000 shares...
Wow.
...Of healthpons.
With the stock swap,
I'm becoming a partner
in healthpons,
and healthpons is becoming
a partner in Ava the elephant.
We're taking our best resources
and putting them together.
We can help
put more smiles
on more
sick children's faces.
WOMAN: We are presenting
to you the Phoenix award
for your creation
of Ava the elephant,
which has benefited
the lives
of many children
across the nation.
KRUMMINS:
To be recognized today
for all of my work
with children
and bringing manufacturing
to the United States
is just phenomenal.
KRUMMINS:
My "Shark Tank" experience
has been truly life-changing.
I went from working as a nanny
to providing for my family.
I'm truly touched.
Thank you.
When you first saw me
on the show,
my daughter was 3 months old.
She has literally grown up
in this industry.
It brings me to tears
thinking about how proud I am to
show her that you can do this.
You can follow your dreams.
[ applause ]
