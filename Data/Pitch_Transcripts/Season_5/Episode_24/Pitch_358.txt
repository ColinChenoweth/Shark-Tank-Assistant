My name is Taylor Robinson,
and I'm from Dallas, Texas.
I'm the proud owner
of Taylor Robinson Music,
and we're here today
to raise $100,000 in exchange
for 10% equity in our company.
Now, I'm a musician.
I've been playing guitar
for over 20 years,
and I started this company while
in my high-school garage band.
And from those meager roots,
we've come to revolutionize
the way people find and hire
private music instructors
all over the country.
Now, it's unfortunate,
but music programs get cut
from schools every day,
leaving parents wondering...
[ chord plays ]
? Where do I go ?
[ laughs ]
? For music lessons?
They often look
on websites they can't trust.
Or they'll look for flyers
at instrument stores,
but they won't know
who they're getting.
They won't know if their
instructors are any good,
if they're a good match
for them,
or if they're even safe
to let into their homes.
Taylor Robinson music says...
[ chord plays ]
? Don't find your teachers
in chat rooms ?
That's gross.
[ laughter ]
Taylor Robinson music
solves these problems
and a whole lot more.
Here's how it works.
Students use our website
or mobile app
by entering in their zip code
and the instrument
that they want to learn.
When they do, they can search
through literally thousands
of Taylor Robinson music
screened and approved
instructors in their area.
They can read reviews.
They can see their specialties.
They can look at maps.
They can even see schedules.
When they pick the instructor
perfect just for them,
they then use our site to
schedule and book the lessons.
And Taylor Robinson music
gets a small commission.
[ chord plays ]
? Cha-ching! ?
? Move it on up ?
[ laughs ]
Sharks, we've had a lot
of success to date,
but we need your expertise
and your help
to crank this thing to 11, so...
[ guitar music plays ]
? Who's ready to rock? ?
With Taylor Robinson music.
GREINER: Yay.
[ applause ]
HERJAVEC: Very good.
very good, ladies.
Whoo!
Beautiful voices.
Thank you so much.
? Taylor,
do we make any money? ?
We've made over $2.5 million
in the past five or six years.
? Ching-ching! ?
[ laughter ]
The last 12 months?
Last year,
we made $450,000.
This year, we're about
to make $550,000.
What's the profit?
How does it work?
Profit's tough.
Tough?
Yeah, the profit numbers
are tough.
We've made only about $40,000
a year in profit,
and that's why we're here today.
oh.
Why?
Why?
Why? Because we have two costs
that are messing up our margins.
The first is the cost
of costumer acquisition.
The second is the cost
of operation.
? How are we gonna fix that? ?
[ laughs ]
ROBINSON:
Well, lucky for you,
I've already fixed
one of those problems.
We have been becoming experts
in local search-engine
optimization.
This is the most effective way
for us to find our students,
but it's still costing us
$33 to acquire each customer.
So, what is your margin
when you do a sale?
An average lesson --
half-hour lesson costs $23.
And what do you make
off of that?
$9.
Wow.
Yeah, 38% margin,
but we're only bringing in
maybe $3 or $2.
Mm.
What we're looking here
to do is raise some money
to finish our enterprise system
to automate a lot of the systems
that we're having to do
manually.
How many instructors
do you have on the site
in total?
Right now, we have
4,000 instructors.
GREINER: How are you
vetting these people?
They're going
into people's homes.
That's the question.
Yes, so what --
now, we're dealing --
safety is number one.
We're looking
at background checks, criminal,
sex offenders, social security.
And that's your overhead cost
that you were talking about
that were killing you,
right?
That --
you do
all that screening?
That's part of the system
that could use automation.
Well --
now, the real situation
is that most instructors are
professional touring musicians.
Our teachers are
not just academics.
We're not the old lady
with the ruler.
I'm a professional musician.
I did this in between tours,
and we're specifically looking
to hire a recording artist.
So there's a coolness
factor, right?
Exactly.
So that leads to,
who are the stars, right?
Brag. You're on national
television, Taylor. Brag.
All right, so, the guitarist
for Earth wind &amp; fire
or -- or a lot of people
that are on "American Idol"
that come second or, you know,
somebody who's
on "America's got talent."
so you have them
on your list?
Absolutely.
And are they actively teaching?
Yeah, they're hugely popular.
So, they're doing it
for 23 bucks?
Right,
so they're offering --
Robert, I know that
you see them on television.
I know that you know the names
of the bands,
but I'm telling you,
these guys do not have as much
money as you think they do.
Taylor, I took guitar lessons
from a master.
I mean, the guy played
with Aerosmith.
He was getting
about 90 bucks an hour
'cause everybody
wanted to use him.
Is there variability?
Absolutely.
I am a premium guy,
and I want to go on your site.
Can I set my price?
Can -- absolutely not.
Whoa, that's a big mistake
in your model.
Instructors cannot
set their price.
O'LEARY:
Well, why do you care?
Why don't you just take
your percentage
off whatever my market rate is?
Our software can't handle
each instructor
having a different rate,
but we're very close
to finishing the software
to do that.
You must be kidding me.
We will be able to do that
with a very small, one-time fee,
about $50,000.
We'll be able to not only make
those adjustments.
We will be able
to simplify payroll.
I would've preferred you
came into the Shark Tank
with all of that worked out
and you just needed to pour
gasoline on a proven model.
That's not what we got here.
Okay.
You should've fixed this stuff
and then come in here saying,
"I fixed it all.
I need $100,000
to pour gasoline on it."
I would've been interested.
I'm not interested in this.
I'm out.
Sir, what we've got here
is sales.
Right.
We've got a proven interest,
a massive proven interest
in our --
in our product
and in our service.
You're very, very close.
There's -- there's a lot
of holes in the Dike,
and you've identified
where they all are.
right.
But putting the putty in there
or putting a finger in there,
that's a little bit
more complicated
than I think
you're giving it credit for.
Sure.
Because if it goes wrong...
Where are you?
You're back in the same hole.
Sure, sure.
Right, and so you're
a little bit too early,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
Right, absolutely, and I --
I think it's spectacular advice.
Taylor,
I think you're close.
Uh-huh.
You're like a -- you're like
an out-of-tune guitar.
[ laughs ]
You just got to tune it up
a little bit.
Mm.
I'm not seeing
the big jump today.
Sure, sure.
I'm out.
Taylor, I'm an investor
on a very similar product
called game changer
meetings.
Okay.
You go on there.
You want to meet
a supermodel
to show you
how to walk down the runway.
Right.
Anybody can show you
how to walk down the runway,
but if you want a supermodel,
it's $4,000.
HERJAVEC: Wow!
I think your positioning
is absolutely wrong.
Mm.
I think you're working hard
and not smart,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
GREINER:
In my business on QVC,
I have to convince somebody
in four minutes
why they should pick up
the phone, why they should buy,
ROBINSON: Even though
we didn't get a deal today,
I'm encouraged to move forward.
They seemed like they liked me
and they liked the business,
and we're just gonna keep doing
what we do.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
are two friends
with a unique way
to create your own energy.
