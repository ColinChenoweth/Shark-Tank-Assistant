The last 12 months?
Last year,
we made $450,000.
This year, we're about
to make $550,000.
What's the profit?
How does it work?
Profit's tough.
Tough?
Yeah, the profit numbers
are tough.
We've made only about $40,000
a year in profit,
[ laughs ]
ROBINSON:
Well, lucky for you,
I've already fixed
one of those problems.
We have been becoming experts
in local search-engine
optimization.
This is the most effective way
for us to find our students,
but it's still costing us
$33 to acquire each customer.
So, what is your margin
when you do a sale?
An average lesson --
half-hour lesson costs $23.
Brag. You're on national
television, Taylor. Brag.
All right, so, the guitarist
for Earth wind &amp; fire
or -- or a lot of people
that are on "American Idol"
that come second or, you know,
somebody who's
on "America's got talent."
so you have them
on your list?
Taylor, I took guitar lessons
from a master.
I mean, the guy played
with Aerosmith.
He was getting
about 90 bucks an hour
'cause everybody
wanted to use him.
Is there variability?
Absolutely.
Taylor,
I think you're close.
Uh-huh.
You're like a -- you're like
an out-of-tune guitar.
[ laughs ]
You just got to tune it up
a little bit.
Mm.
I'm not seeing
the big jump today.
Sure, sure.
I'm out.
Taylor, I'm an investor
on a very similar product
called game changer
meetings.
Okay.
You go on there.
You want to meet
a supermodel
to show you
how to walk down the runway.
Right.
Anybody can show you
how to walk down the runway,
but if you want a supermodel,
it's $4,000.
HERJAVEC: Wow!
I think your positioning
is absolutely wrong.
ROBINSON: Even though
we didn't get a deal today,
I'm encouraged to move forward.
