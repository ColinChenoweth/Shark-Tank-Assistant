JORDAN: He read it every day
that week.
Hi.
My name's Jordan.
But when it comes
to business,
you can call me
the chief mom.
Jordan, tell us
a little about your background.

as head of k--
a week ago.
A week -- a week ago
as head of k-through-12
education at Google.
GREINER: Oh, wow.
Wow.
CORCORAN: To focus
on this full-time?
Yes.
HERJAVEC: Felix,
what's your background?
I'm Washington --
I'm a former Washington,
D.C., teacher of the year.
Yes.
JORDAN: Yes.
HERJAVEC:
But I got to tell you,
I want to make money.
He doesn't get excited
about that, Felix.
I know that. M-making money
changes the world.
You come into the shark tank,
you get all of these sharks
that have had experience
in different sectors.
mm-hmm.
So, guys, if that's the case,
I'll make you an offer.
FELIX: All right.
250k, but I need
30% of the business.
Would you consider 20%?
I'll meet you
in the middle.
