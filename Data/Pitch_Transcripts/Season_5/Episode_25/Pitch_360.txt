My name
is Felix Brandon Lloyd,
and this is my wife,
Jordan Lloyd Bookey.
We live in Washington, D.C.,
with our two beautiful kids,
and we're the founders
of Zoobean.
Whee!
[ laughs ]
My son received
a book in the mail
from a family friend.
And he so loved this book,
both because it was
a wonderful story
and it pictured
a mixed family like ours.
Everybody's going
in the water.
JORDAN: He read it every day
that week.
And it was a very powerful
experience for us.
And it dawned on us
that we could create
this delightful experience
for families everywhere.
That's why
we created Zoobean.
Felix and I have both been
in education for many years.
For us, education is
really everything.
It is the one thing
that if we get it right,
it can help change the
trajectory of anybody's life.
Zoobean means to us
an opportunity to make
a difference in the world
and make a difference
in our own lives
and our children's lives.
[ laughter ]
Hi.
My name's Jordan.
But when it comes
to business,
you can call me
the chief mom.
And I'm Felix --
of course, the chief dad.
Our company
is called Zoobean,
and we're seeking
a $250,000 investment
in exchange
for 15% equity.
We first met
as teachers.
But it's
when we became parents
that building
our kids' love of reading
became more personal.
The truth is,
we found it difficult
to discover children's books
that met our kids'
particular interests
or that pictured families
like ours.
And that's
why we created Zoobean,
a children's book
discovery platform
and highly personalized
subscription service.
So, Zoobean uses filters
like recommended age,
language,
interests like
not-so-pink girls,
or main character's
background,
like being
from a mixed family.
That way, our platform
curates the right book
and eventually
other products.
For us, Zoobean is
as much our mission
as it is our business.
Sharks, please join us
in helping
all of our kids imagine
and achieve anything.
So, you're pre-selecting
for them,
making the task easier.
I-I lived in this space
for 12 years,
and I'm gonna guess
that 80% of your sales
are between the ages of 3 and 8
years old, okay?
So, here's the problem --
in actually acquiring
the customer at that age,
for every company that's tried,
has been a huge challenge
in actually the cost
of customer acquisition
because you've got
about 20 million people
moving through that zone
every 12 months.
This is the whole business,
my friends.
That's all there is
to worry about.
Do you know what your
customer-acquisition cost is?
Customer-acquisitions cost
is about $6.03.
Wow.
How many have you
been able to get?
How many subscribers
do you have?
We have 85 subscribers
and gifters.
HERJAVEC: 85,000?
85 subscribers
and gifters.
We launched a beta version
just two months ago.
It seems to me there's a need
for what you're doing.
I don't know, though. Is there
other competition out there?
Yeah, Amazon.
[ chuckles ]
Is this something
that people are really needing
and you're fulfilling that
in the marketplace?
I think I can start
to answer
by -- by finishing
how the product works.
As a user, you can come
to the site
and state a number
of preferences.
Once all that data's
in there,
automatically our system
will then query and say,
"Mr. Cuban's child has
a reading level this level,
is interested in this type
of subject, these --"
Okay, so, that's
still very simple search
based off of tags, right,
which isn't going
to get you very far
because you can put together
lists on Amazon,
and you can even put together
subscriptions on Amazon.
What I'm trying to do is figure
out if there is a secret sauce.
Yes. Right.
Right.
What's the secret sauce?
It's the difference
between Google
and another search engine,
right?
What is it
that makes you different?
Technology-wise,
when you look at it,
the back end is data
and -- and -- and
matching tags with data.
Firstly, we assign a relevant
score to each of those users.
Okay.
And that relevant score
is based
on those tags
being weighted.
And then it becomes informed
by user behavior.
And then we say
these are the potential items
that could match up
with this.
So, the difference
between you and Amazon
is you're more specific.
But I think, though,
there's nothing really
that unique.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
CORCORAN:
Help me with an example.
I have a 7-year-old daughter
who's adopted.
And when she was born,
I went on Amazon.
So here's a perfect parallel.
A specialty --
I wanted to find
every book on adoption
and storybooks for children.
Yes.
What would have been
different
if I had gone on your website
and had that same experience?
If you'd gone on our website,
first of all,
it would have been probably
a more pleasant experience.
You'd go through, you'd -- you'd
look, and you'd see adoption.
Then you might want,
you know,
female characters,
for example, for your --
in other words, if I had
something very specific.
Now I want it just about little
girls who are adopted.
I could put
female adoption?
Right.
Correct. Correct.
That have
female characters --
so -- so to Lori's point --
I-I think
she was clear on that.
I really don't think there's
a need for the business,
so I am out.
Jordan, tell us
a little about your background.
Jordan just left her job
as head of k--
a week ago.
A week -- a week ago
as head of k-through-12
education at Google.
GREINER: Oh, wow.
Wow.
CORCORAN: To focus
on this full-time?
Yes.
HERJAVEC: Felix,
what's your background?
I'm Washington --
I'm a former Washington,
D.C., teacher of the year.
And then after that, I left
and started a technology venture
that I had an exit from
three years ago.
It was kids-
and education-related.
I think you guys
are very solid
'cause my children
are voracious readers.
Yes.
JORDAN: Yes.
HERJAVEC:
But I got to tell you,
they can go online,
and they can search
for almost any book that they
want to find today.
And I just currently don't see
it today. I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Finding the customer
and getting the full value,
which is really
only about five years,
I don't know if you're gonna get
there with this baby.
I'm not kidding. It's --
it's a -- it's gonna be
a really tough, uh, ride.
But isn't that
what it's about?
Isn't business about a struggle?
I mean, Jeff Bezos --
I get it.
I get all that.
But I just -- I-I'm trying
to find a way to get excited
because this is my space --
or was my space.
Well, get excited
about changing the world.
No, I --
you know,
one of these things that --
listen to me, seriously.
I don't want to change
the world.
I want to make money.
He doesn't get excited
about that, Felix.
I know that. M-making money
changes the world.
You come into the shark tank,
you get all of these sharks
that have had experience
in different sectors.
mm-hmm.
And it -- we're a venture
capital firm on steroids.
There's nobody like us.
You're all hearing
the different challenges
from -- from all of us,
and -- and the one --
the only one I care about is
the one that I've lived through,
which is
customer-acquisition cost.
I think you'll do a great job
monetizing it
after you've got them.
But I think
they're gonna cost you
more than you'll make
off of them.
And for that reason, I'm out.
Is everybody else out?
Yeah.
Good.
Guys, I-I disagree
completely.
I think trusted curation
is the future.
The question is,
what's after books?
Because the value in
this has nothing to do
with books, right?
It has everything to do
with helping grandma
find something
when she has no idea
what to get.
Absolutely.
But you haven't convinced me
that you've got something,
or -- and you haven't told me
why you've got something
that allows that to happen
in a way that someone else
can't do.
Now, somebody else can do it,
but we're gonna do it better.
It's a huge --
but you got to tell me how
you're gonna do it better.
No one says --
no one comes in here and says,
"You know what, Mark?
I'm gonna do it worse,"
or, "I'm just gonna
do it average,"
or, "I'm gonna do it
the same as everybody else."
You haven't explained to me.
Because, Mark, you see --
you see an awful lot
of technology plays.
This is not
a technology company.
But that's what I'm trying
to figure out, 'cause --
it's not.
it's a marketing company.
Let me decide
if it's technology or not, okay?
Yeah, but they're not even
telling you they're playing
it on a technology platform.
That's like saying Google is
just a search company, right?
Right.
It's -- it's just not,
right?
Right.
Because I'm trying to figure out
where this can go.
Yes, thank you.
Right? What --
what is it capable of doing?
Right.
Could the software
be extended
so that if you created
an inventory
of all the children's-oriented
shows on Netflix...
Yes.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
...All the movies
on Netflix...
...And a current
programing guide...
Yes.
...From all the different
TV networks...
Yes.
Yes.
...Could I go in there
and it would tell me
which shows are appropriate
and recommend which?
Yes.
Exactly what it could do.
Yes, exactly.
CUBAN: So now if, all
of a sudden, you're
saying, Zoobean,
you're not quite sure what shows
your kids can watch, right?
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Put in this data,
we'll show you
which shows are applicable,
whether it's Netflix...
Yes.
...Whether it's Hulu,
whether it's anywhere.
And, oh, by the way,
buy our books.
Now you're getting
two different ways to populate.
Yes.
But that's happening
already.
Oh, my goodness.
No, not -- not within
one centralized location.
Yeah? Check out Disney.
No, not -- not --
no, I'm not talking about
TV guides and everything.
I'm -- out-outside of Disney,
you want someplace,
'cause not all Disney's gonna be
appropriate for what you do.
right.
It's got to be
independent. Okay.
Right.
So, guys, if that's the case,
I'll make you an offer.
FELIX: All right.
250k, but I need
30% of the business.
Would you consider 20%?
I'll meet you
in the middle.
Mark, we are excited and
ecstatic to accept your offer.
Let's do this.
Thank you.
Hey, you're -- you're nice guys.
We'll do a deal.
Poker face not -- not
as good as you.
Thank you, Mark.
My pleasure.
Great deal. Good luck.
Thanks. Thank you.
[ laughter ]
It's the same thing
about Netflix.
Netflix at the beginning
and the recommendation engine
started with nothing.
This has
to go through that.
But, Mark, Netflix had
a unique proposition
out of the gate.
no, they didn't.
Sure, they did.
No, they didn't.
Netflix's big angle was
data, and they put cash
up front to get content.
Look. This is
a very binary business.
It's either a home run, or --
or it's a strikeout, right?
And if they hit it,
it's enormous.
