My name is Erika Pope,
and my company is Fort Magic.
I am here seeking
a $75,000 investment
in exchange for 15%
of my company.
Erika, you must have
very amazing numbers.
Yes, it has been
amazingly received.
You want to share those
with us?
Sure. So, Fort Magic has been
open for 18 months.
O'LEARY:
Erika, how have you sold it?
You've done it online?
Have you worked with retailers?
We sell almost entirely through
Amazon, as a matter of fact.
HERJAVEC: Erika, tell me
a little bit about the product.
You mention one kit
can do multiple things.
POPE: Actually,
we are patent-pending.
O'LEARY: So, tell me
about the numbers.
Tell us what it costs,
what it costs to make,
who's making it for you.
Sure.
Is it built in America
or offshore?
Okay.
What are your margins,
all that good stuff?
That's a lot of questions
at once. Oh, my gosh.
It's all one question.
No problem. I'll answer
all of them, no problem.
Well, because I want
to know about money.
Sure, of course.
We all want to know about money
when it comes to business,
so no problem.
I just want to bring
to your attention, by the way,
Erika, let me say, I think
your enthusiasm is delicious.
Thank you.
You're bubbling over,
but let me tell you,
your answers to the questions
are driving me nuts.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
You're all over the place.
I feel like you don't know
what you're shooting at.
Let me give you one shot
at that.
Okay, yes.
If I said to you, what are
your top three priorities,
starting tomorrow morning
when you go to work,
what would they be?
Um...Sorry,
I'm quite caught off guard.
Top three priorities.
Well, immediately
or in general? I'm sorry.
Immediate --
the next day,
the next week.
You're making her point.
You realize that.
[ chuckles ]
Well, I'm sorry.
Okay, I've never seen
an entrepreneur
ever in my life succeed
without being
hyper-focused
on exactly
what's most important.
For me, it certainly
wouldn't be a good fit,
Erika, you're going
200 miles an hour,
Erika, most families
in America
can't pay $199
for a child's toy.
They just can't.
I mean, that is really high
in the children's toy business.
If you want this to be big,
it has to be for under $100.
I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, Kevin.
Erika only has one chance
to make a deal.
I think you're gonna sell
a ton of forts.
O'LEARY: Are you making
an offer?
I am making an offer.
My challenge
is keeping you focused.
For me to be involved
with the business,
I would need to be
an equal partner with you.
$75,000 for 50%.
Okay, thank you, Robert.
Let me ask you this,
Robert.
For 50%, can you tell me
exactly what you think
that you'll be bringing
in terms of, like, moving
our distribution
No, Erika,
that is a great question.
There's a bunch of things
that I think
POPE: I'm actually
a very focused person.
Even though I may not answer
every question immediately,
that certainly doesn't take
anything away from the fact
that I know exactly what we're
doing with Fort Magic.
I know what our plan is. I know
where we are going forward.
