Hello, sharks.
My name is Corey Egan.
And my name
is Swapnil Bora.
We're from Dallas, Texas,
and our company
is ilumi solutions.
We're here to show you
the future of lighting.
We are seeking $350,000
of investment
in exchange for 15% ownership
in our company.
Ilumi is a series
of intelligent
and tunable L.E.D. light bulbs
you control wirelessly
right from a mobile device.
It's very simple.
Screw in any number of ilumi,
download the app,
and you get complete control
over your lighting.
It's about having the right
light at the right time.
So, Barbara,
you're an early riser.
CORCORAN: Yes, I am.
Imagine waking up
feeling refreshed and alert
with a simulated sunrise that
slowly eases you out of bed.
Hmm.
Robert, got a busy day
ahead of you.
Every day.
You got your phone, your keys,
your wallet.
You head outside,
and your lights automatically
turn off behind you.
And when you return,
your lights greet you,
welcoming you home.
Kevin, connect your ilumi
to your stock portfolio
so you can know
if you're in the red...
[ laughter ]
...Or the green.
It's always red.
Lori, set the perfect romantic
candlelit atmosphere
and relax
with the husband.
CORCORAN: Ooh.
And, Mark, represent
your team and ours
by lighting it up blue and green
on game day.
Go, Mavericks. Yeah.
Yes. Go, Mavs.
And after the Mavericks win,
of course,
let the celebration begin.
[ dance music plays ]
GREINER: [ laughs ]
Whoo!
Ahh. Pretty cool.
[ music stops ]
Very cute.
Corey,
how does it work?
Do I plug something
into my outlet
and that controls
all the lights?
It is
the light themselves.
So, we have
two sizes of light,
and all you need are
the bulbs and the app.
So you just --
and you can put the bulb
into any light fixture
that you have.
any light fixture.
So, we've got --
so, you're using Wi-Fi
in a house then?
It's actually
bluetooth-based.
Bluetooth.
So, where are you at with this
in the market?
So, we're at the final stages
of development.
Swapnil and I were
actually classmates
at U.T. Dallas
where we came up with the idea.
We're now right at the doorstep
to manufacturing,
which is why, really,
we're here today.
How much
is each light bulb?
$289 for a three-pack.
Whoa.
CORCORAN: Wow.
It's $90 a light bulb.
Correct.
Wow.
How long does it last compared
to a normal light bulb?
It lasts
up to 20 years.
From the consumer point
of view,
making that decision
between a $100 bulb
and one for $2.80
is gonna be a very tough call.
What we've seen is
that both consumers
as well as commercial folks
when they're looking to get
the most from their space,
ilumi is actually
an easier and more
cost-effective solution.
You're not selling
light bulbs.
You're selling
a lighting system.
Exactly.
Correct.
So tell me how many steps it
takes to get the system working.
It takes
essentially two steps.
Screw in the light bulb.
Got it.
Download the app. Go straight
to the setup process.
From that, the bulb finds
the app...
Can I see the app?
Sure.
...Connects,
and that's it.
I have to ask
the magic question.
Do you have a patent pending
on this or a patent on this?
Great question.
We have filed U.S.
And one international
utility patents pending.
O'LEARY:
Tell me if I'm wrong,
but I'm sort of focusing
on what matters in this deal.
If your I.P. clears,
if your intellectual property
clears,
you don't really want to be
in the light bulb-building
business
and distribution
and logistics business.
Or do you?
This is our answer.
So, we know that the value
in this company
will come from, one,
building a great company
that we are manufacturing
and shipping bulbs.
Wow.
There's so many players
in the light business
that have
massive market share.
If I -- if there was ever
a licensing deal
in the shark tank, you're it.
But you're telling me,
"I can't wait to build
my light-bulb factory."
That sucks.
CUBAN: When are you gonna have
your samples,
and when will you
be able to ship?
So, our goal is to ship
by the end of this year.
So we're ready to start
the tooling process right now.
That's one of the reasons
we're here
and we're asking
for the $350,000.
Your money gets our product
into customers' hands.
I just want to clear
the field.
Sure.
I'm -- I hate to tell you,
I'm a disbeliever here.
Turning on my lights
with my iPad
for me just seems weird.
And $99 for a light bulb
versus 3 bucks
is a heck of a hard sell.
Sure.
It just doesn't strike me
as a realistic amount.
Well, I appreciate
your consideration, Barbara.
Pleasure.
I'm concerned with some
of your competition out there
because I know
you do have competition.
And I'm not sure --
I think I love this
for the consumer market.
But I'm not sure
where you're gonna fall
when you finish everything
if you get the I.p.
If you don't, then I'm afraid
that you're not going to be able
to be competitive.
So, for that reason, I'm out.
Where I see
a real opportunity
is in the lighting market
that is very complicated
and very high-end.
Yes.
In that market,
your $100 light bulb is cheap.
Exactly. Exactly.
Exactly.
HERJAVEC: Okay.
All right.
Let me start with an offer.
I'll give you
the $350,000
for 35%.
Well, first of all, I really
appreciate the offer, Robert.
So, you know, thank you,
and I'm excited that you're
interested in ilumi.
I would like to,
if it's okay,
be open to other offers,
as well.
All right, guys.
I'll make it easy. Look.
I think Robert is being
a little bit greedy,
but I'm not gonna be
totally ungreedy
because I think I can bring
a lot of value.
So, what I'll offer you
is the $350,000 for 25%.
Mark, we really appreciate
your offer, as well.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
Ichi-wow-a.
HERJAVEC: I know!
Oh, my God.
You got to tell me
yes or no.
If it --
if it's too much equity
and that's what you feel,
and you have a --
you have a limit
that you've set for yourselves,
then let's not go
back and forth.
sure --
just tell me the limit and if
you want to do a deal with me,
then we'll figure it out.
Well, why don't you wait and see
if you have any other offers?
EGAN: I-I would
appreciate that.
If possible,
I'd also like to see
if there's other folks
with more questions.
You know, Corey,
I wouldn't --
All right, guys.
I'm out.
NARRATOR: Corey and Swapnil
had two offers on the table,
but their indecision
has changed Mark's mind.
If it's too much equity
and that's what you feel,
and you have a --
you have a limit
that you've set for yourselves,
then let's not go
back and forth.
sure --
just tell me the limit and if
you want to do a deal with me,
then we'll figure it out.
Well, why don't you wait and see
if you have any other offers?
I-I would
appreciate that.
If possible,
I'd also like to see
if there's other folks
with more questions.
You know, Corey,
I wouldn't --
all right, guys.
I'm out.
Doggone it. I was gonna warn you
on that one.
EGAN: Mark, I --
you know, I-I know the
24-second shot clock.
I didn't even get
the 24-second shot clock.
CUBAN: Yeah, it's not even
about that, guys. Look.
It was an opportunity to say,
"Look, Mark. Here's the number."
Yeah.
and if you wanted to do
business with me,
you would have given me
the number.
Mark, if you could give us
a moment,
we would love to take
the time.
fine, that's fine.
that's fine.
Is that all right?
Okay. Fine, fine, fine.
Okay. All right. Thank you.
O'LEARY: I'll -- I'll put
another offer on the table
that doesn't involve
so much equity.
My offer's much simpler.
I'm not interested
in any equity at all.
I'll give you $350,000
upon the clearance
of your I.p.
And one contingency --
that you allow me to license it
to a very large
light-bulb manufacturer.
I'm not interested
in funding
growth in manufacturing
light bulbs.
I want 15%
of the royalty stream.
You keep the whole company.
I'll make you a lot richer
faster with my strategy.
And if you can't get
a license, what then?
It reverts back to them.
So, Corey, let's
just keep in mind
the person who first made you
the offer...
Yes.
...Was me.
Mark is simply tagging along
on my offer.
Yeah.
Kevin's royalty deal
is just ludicrous.
You can't do that.
You need both of those options.
Right.
I don't know.
You should think about that.
My offers are
always very well thought-out.
Guys, you -- you already know
what's going on here, right?
Robert didn't quite get
it, so he asked for a
chunk of the company.
Kevin did
what he always does...
That's ridiculous.
I got it right away.
...And put out
a ridiculous offer.
Why do you want
to manufacture anything?
Why do you want to go
through that headache?
Look, if someone comes along
and makes the right offer
on a licensing deal,
yeah, absolutely, right?
But the biggest upside
for this company
is going to come
from ongoing development.
You know,
that's ridiculous.
You could get a $4 million
advance on your license,
fund your next five ideas
from it,
and never spend an hour
in the plant.
You guys are nuts.
EGAN:
I think the challenge
that I'm seeing is,
you know, we do --
the patents are pending,
and, you know, we've put
a lot in to that.
It's getting
from here to there.
Are your patents gonna clear
or not? What do you think?
Even if they don't --
oh, I'm sorry, my friend.
If they don't, you've got
a world of hurt.
You're just off to --
no, 'cause you're just
off to the races,
and it's a real business --
just a nice small
light-bulb manufacturer.
Look,
in my perfect world,
all the patents for software
go away anyways,
and you just hustle
and you grind.
this is not software.
It's a little bit of
a feeding frenzy in the tank.
EGAN: Yes.
HERJAVEC: Corey, look.
You know what?
I'm out.
And I'll tell you why I wanted
so much equity.
It was simply commensurate
with the risk.
I don't see
that wide a market.
So I think you've got one
equity offer, and you've
got and a royalty offer.
So, guys, he's out.
EGAN: Yeah.
Kevin's offer
is ridiculous.
My offer's great. I just want
you to deliver the patent.
Kevin, I'm gonna get him
to write a software program
that just puts a puppet there
and just recalculates
the same offer
and just the same offer.
because I'm right
every time,
over and over and over.
enough! enough, guys.
Corey,
if you go with Mark,
you're gonna listen
to this every day.
EGAN: So, first of all,
I want to thank you all
for your time today again.
Kevin, we appreciate the offer,
but it doesn't really match
with the vision for what
we're trying to achieve.
You want
to make light bulbs.
We want to make
light bulbs
and make a great business
and bring ilumi to the world.
Mark, would you be willing
to meet in the middle
at 20% for the $350,000?
I'm gonna stick
to the 25%, guys,
'cause you know I can bring
a huge amount of value.
Could I ask you --
I think everyone in here
could pick up the phone
and make one phone call
that could change the game
for us.
Who would be
your phone call?
Depends on who we need
to call.
All right? There's nobody
that's not gonna take my call.
Good answer.
That's a good answer.
Okay, Mark.
You've got a deal.
I knew it.
Let's go to work.
GREINER: Good deal.
Congratulations.
It's a great program, guys.
Thank you.
Congratulations, man.
I'm looking forward
to it. Yes, sir.
Thanks, Mark.
That's what
I'm talking about.
Live your lights.
Live your lights.
Light up your life, baby.
Mark, I want one.
EGAN: Working with Mark,
it's gonna be a tremendous fit.
He gets the technology
that we're bringing
and our vision
to make it happen.
Mark's just gonna be
like fuel on the fire.
It's -- this thing is gonna
spread like wildfire,
and ilumi's gonna shine
across the world.
NARRATOR:
Earlier this season,
Charles yim made a deal
with all five sharks
for his smartphone breathalyzer,
Breathometer.
All five sharks will give you
$1 million for 30%.
I accept.
All right.
GREINER: Whoo!
NARRATOR: Let's see
what's happening now.
Since "Shark Tank,"
it's been crazy busy.
We've got a ton
of pre-orders --
actually more than we can
even catch up with.
When I first went in the tank,
we only had $140,000 in sales.
After closing a deal
with all five sharks,
we closed $1 million
in just three months.
We had to scale up
our production
just to keep up
with the demand.
Charles.
Hey, Kevin.
O'LEARY: I came to the bay area
today to check in on Charles.
It's unique
that we have a deal
where every shark has put
their money to work.
Everybody knows this thing is
going to be very successful.
I'm their eyes today.
I'm getting
a lot of e-mails
from people that do not have
their device yet.
Right.
What are you doing
about it?
Being back-ordered is
not a good problem.
You want happy customers,
not ones that are waiting
for their product.
I have to come here
and beat him with a stick.
We were only manufacturing
roughly about 1,000 units
a week.
Now we're at 15,000 units
a week.
We'll be, in about three
weeks, current with
all our pre-orders.
And then the backlog
will be filled.
Yep.
The operation looks
like it's working.
He's been delayed.
Now he's getting the product
out the door.
This is important.
Hey, guys.
Look who stopped by.
YIM: Working with all five
sharks has been amazing.
Each brings value to the table
in a very different, unique way.
Kevin's been helping us
with international distribution.
Mark's been instrumental
in bringing us
to big-box retailers.
Lori's working on helping us
get on QVC.
Robert and Daymond
have helped us with
distribution here in the U.S.,
but on top of that,
they've really helped
us refine our branding.
JOHN: You know, not only
  are you saving lives,
I know you want to make it
more of a science technology
  and medical company.
We're now more than just
a smartphone breathalyzer.
We're moving on to things
like halitosis,
dehydration, diabetes,
asthma.
Our main goal is
to improve patient healthcare
and continue saving lives.
So to be able to see the company
launch a product
and create new jobs
in just three months,
it's an amazing feeling
to have.
