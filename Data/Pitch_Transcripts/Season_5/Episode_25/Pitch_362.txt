Hi.
My name is Chase Hoyt.
And this is my father.
I'm Bob Hoyt.
We're from Tucson, Arizona,
and our company is
Intelli-Stopper Technology.
We're seeking $250,000
in exchange
for 10% equity.
Sharks,
our Intelli-Stopper Technology
will redefine
and revolutionize
food and beverage
preservation.
The problem
with current wine preservers is
you never know when
you've pumped out the
right amount of air,
and you never know when air gets
back into the bottle.
And preservers on the market
allow air
to seep back in within minutes
to hours of preserving.
So, Mr. Wonderful,
that very expensive bottle
of '69 Château Margaux
that you have is being --
just one of many.
just one --
is being exposed to oxygen
when you think
it's being preserved...
Until now.
The intelli-stopper is
the first preserver
on the market that has
a red visual indicator.
So for the first time,
you can see that all
of your wine is preserved.
Let me show you
how it works.
But before I do,
how about I hand out some wine?
Absolutely. Great idea.
Sure.
Here we go.
Thank you.
There you go.
Lori.
It's better than boxed.
Ladies first.
Thank you.
There we go.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
There you go.
Cheers.
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
CORCORAN: It's free.
It might not be as good
as O'Leary fine wines,
but it's pretty darn good.
Of course. Thank you.
I'm sure
it's much better.
There we go.
So, drink up, you guys.
Thank you.
If I -- if I have a sip of this
and I go blind,
there'll be hell to pay.
It's great wine.
Okay, that wine has
been preserved with
the intelli-stopper.
How long was it
since it was opened?
Five days.
Okay.
Well -- well, show us
how it works, Chase.
Sure. Absolutely.
We've had a few glasses
of wine.
Put the stopper in the top
of the bottle.
You can see that red indicator
is up right now
because, obviously, there's
still oxygen in there.
Pump the air out,
and you'll see
that red indicator goes down.
When you see a clear window,
you know that your wine
is preserved.
So, by taking the air
out of it...
Yes.
...It -- the wine
lasts longer.
Absolutely.
Yeah, so --
so if I don't do
the preserver thing...
Yeah.
...How long will
the wine last?
So, on average, um, maybe
two days, maybe three days.
That's it?
And that bottle of wine,
how long will that last?
With this product, it will
last up to two weeks.
If air gets back
in that bottle,
you're gonna see the red
indicator creeps right back up.
O'LEARY:
Yeah, but, Chase --
so you can visually see that
your wine is preserved.
I have, I don't know,
six cellars now...
Sure.
...With tens of thousands
of bottles of wine.
I own every single preservation
system ever made...
Yeah.
...Including the ones
that do nitrogen, argon gas,
you name it.
Right.
Yours is a derivative
of a very popular one
that does do $15 million
in sales.
You've added an indicator
that air goes in.
That's the only difference,
right?
Yes.
Is this
the only product?
We have four skus
with this product line.
Okay.
And we are extending
into multiple markets.
Chase,
what were your sales?
Last year,
we sold $150,000.
This year, we're on pace
to sell $300,000.
And we just locked
a major retailer,
which is really exciting.
Which one?
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Really?
People that are passionate
about wine buy everything.
I'll buy one, but for me
to get my head
around a value
of $2 1/2 million...
As a start-up company,
you should never argue value.
Instead, we have to show you
a-a limited perception of risk,
and that's exactly
what we've done...
Oh, well said.
...Because what we have --
proof of concept,
we have growing sales,
we've got proof of market,
we've got patented
intellectual property.
All right, so what's next?
Okay, so what's next?
So, we're taking all of this
technology to --
the first is olive-oil
preservation with olivedoctor.
Think about the olive oil
that you have
that sits on your counter
or in your cupboard
that goes
stale and rancid.
You use it for --
olive oil goes stale?
Absolutely. Actually --
I thought
it lasts forever.
Or is it honey
that lasts forever?
Honey -- honey does
last forever.
Does love last forever?
O'LEARY: I know -- you know,
Robert, I know there's --
there's somewhere on you
I could plug this in
and suck the air out of you.
[ laughter ]
But once you get up
to about a month,
depending on the olive oil,
it's rancid.
Sealed?
There's one challenge
with the high-end olive oils
is that the bottle sizes
vary dramatically.
I have a pretty large collection
of olive oils,
and this would only work
in maybe 10% of the bottles.
Really expensive oils are being
collected like wines now.
It's in my wine cellar.
You collect oils?
[ laughs ]
So when you open it up...
But it's not black oil.
...You may have one or two
months to use it.
I've got some oils
that are $300 a bottle.
Do you really?
You got what?!
Yeah.
What are your other applications
for this?
The next, which we're very
excited about, is to coffee.
So, 2.4 billion cups of coffee
are consumed every day.
We can take our intelli-stopper
technology --
Okay.
We know there's a big market.
Do you have the patent
for any of this?
Well, we have
three patents.
We have two design patents --
one in the U.S., the other is
in the European union --
and we have pending
a functionality patent,
and so we have
some protection on that.
When you say functionality,
you mean utility patent?
Utility.
Yeah.
I feel like everybody
has seen dozens
of these kinds of things
claiming to preserve wine
in particular.
And I, for one, have bought
many of them.
Yeah.
I don't think there's
enough point of difference
that makes this jump apart
from the crowd and me say,
"Wow! I got to get
my hands on this thing."
So, because it seems
like more of the same
with a little twist,
I'm out.
Okay.
Guys, it's obvious that you've
built a better mousetrap.
But I have no idea what
the mouse is and where it goes.
People collect oils?
Seriously?
I thought those things
get better with age.
So, I mean, it's really not
a fit for me.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
GREINER: For me, the problem
here is, is I've seen a lot --
I'm very familiar
with this space.
And there are other products
out there very similar,
so I'm out.
Chase, let me make it
really simple.
Not for me.
I'm out.
So, I use your competitor
every day
because I start my evening with
a single glass of Montrachet
which often comes out
of a new bottle.
And your breakfast
and your lunch.
[ laughter ]
And then I -- then I stop it
and put it back into the cooler
with the competing product.
CHASE: Right.
And then I hit the reds.
Mm-hmm.
So, I generally have
two bottles stopped.
The reason they have my business
is they have the distribution.
I think the problem with this
deal is the value put on it.
There's so much we could be
doing together
if you weren't
such greedy pigs.
[ chuckles ]
That's really
the problem here.
You've -- you've --
it's impossible
to give you $250,000 for --
I'd have to own
the whole company.
I'm sorry, but I'm out.
Okay.
CUBAN: Good luck, guys.
Thank you, Bob.
Thanks, Chase.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
GREINER: Good luck, guys.
All the best.
Thank you.
Kevin,
we're all friends here.
Yes.
We love you.
Yes.
You have a problem.
[ laughter ]
