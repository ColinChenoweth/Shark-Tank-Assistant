My name is Erika Pope,
and my company is Fort Magic.
I am here seeking
a $75,000 investment
in exchange for 15%
of my company.
Remember being a kid and how
much fun it was to build forts
when you wanted to bring your
greatest fantasies to life,
but the frustration you had
that all you had to work with
was couch cushions
that would fall apart
or a card table that looked
nothing like your imagination?
Well, enter Fort Magic,
where a child can build a fort
as big as their imagination.
The magic of our Fort Magic kit
is in the large number
and variety
of sticks and connectors
included in every kit.
With just one Fort Magic kit,
a child can build
unlimited fort designs.
They can build a castle fort.
They could build a pirate ship.
Or they could build a racecar.
Who's ready to come aboard
a company that has a product
that has been repeatedly called
the best money spent
on a toy ever?
Erika, you must have
very amazing numbers.
Yes, it has been
amazingly received.
You want to share those
with us?
Sure. So, Fort Magic has been
open for 18 months.
And in those 18 months,
we have made $150,000 in sales.
O'LEARY:
Erika, how have you sold it?
You've done it online?
Have you worked with retailers?
We sell almost entirely through
Amazon, as a matter of fact.
HERJAVEC: Erika, tell me
a little bit about the product.
You mention one kit
can do multiple things.
Did I understand
that correctly?
That is correct.
How big is that kit?
So, each kit comes
with all of these pieces.
There are 384 pieces
in a kit.
When you receive
the retail box,
it's 26 inches by 10 inches
by 10 inches.
Oh, wow. That's big.
Yes, but every
Fort Magic kit comes
with a very high quality,
excellent storage bag.
That's gonna be difficult
to get into retail ever.
That's a very large footprint.
What's the unique part
of the connectors?
Have you -- is -- is the way
that they connect unique?
Like, when I put it together,
is it -- is it hard?
Like, how do I --
oh, I have test samples.
Would you like to try some?
Yes.
Sure.
Here, everyone.
Here's some pieces.
HERJAVEC: It's actually
really well made.
Like, it's a lot sturdier
than I would have thought.
It's very sturdy.
This can't be patentable,
is it?
POPE: Actually,
we are patent-pending.
O'LEARY: So, tell me
about the numbers.
Tell us what it costs,
what it costs to make,
who's making it for you.
Sure.
Is it built in America
or offshore?
Okay.
What are your margins,
all that good stuff?
That's a lot of questions
at once. Oh, my gosh.
It's all one question.
No problem. I'll answer
all of them, no problem.
Well, because I want
to know about money.
Sure, of course.
We all want to know about money
when it comes to business,
so no problem.
I just want to bring
to your attention, by the way,
this is our teepee,
and simultaneous to the teepee,
you can make
your stick buddy horse.
So, just pointing that
out to you.
[ laughs ]
What's your background?
How did you come up with this?
I was a stay-at-home mom
for 15 years,
and I love being
a stay-at-home mom,
and I, you know, love
my children.
My son was playing
with his dryer box
that was falling apart.
I just thought, "You know,
we can do better than this."
And then we started playing
with the idea.
And we actually --
we had to invent the
way to bend our sticks.
When I started playing with it,
it was so much fun.
And then when we covered it,
it was,
"Oh, it's so adorable.
It's so cute."
Back to the numbers.
back to the numbers.
Well, but the thing is,
before the numbers...
O'LEARY: Okay, please.
Let me ask you --
wait, wait, wait.
Before I die of old age,
tell me what these sell for
and how much you make.
let me ask you
one thing, though.
None of the fabric
comes with, though.
That you have to do
yourself.
That is correct.
Which fabric?
All the fabrics on these.
Any of the fabric.
Does it come with a mom
to make the fabrics
to cover the shell?
So, tell me
about the numbers.
Um, our -- not deviating
from the numbers on purpose.
I think you are.
Okay, great. So, our Fort Magic
kit sells for $199.
Whoa. Ain't cheap.
We currently manufacture the
Fort Magic kit for $40 a kit.
And we can get it
to the end user for $50 a kit.
So our margins are 75%.
We profit approximately,
well, $100 per kit.
How much money have you put
into this?
So, I have invested $50,000.
Um, my mother has invested
$200,000.
Ohh!
$200,000?!
Yes, $200,000.
Whoa, mommy dearest.
How much does mommy own
of the company?
So, the original split
is 50/50,
but we recently brought in
another investor.
He's actually committed
$200,000 at 35%.
What does that do
to the equity breakdown?
'cause he's gonna get 35%,
you and your mom
were 50/50.
Yes.
Right?
Who takes the hit?
Is it just equally,
so now you're all...
Equally.
...Basically third, third,
third partners.
Well, essentially, yes.
But I have complete authority
to negotiate here today.
Erika, let me say, I think
your enthusiasm is delicious.
Thank you.
You're bubbling over,
but let me tell you,
your answers to the questions
are driving me nuts.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
You're all over the place.
I feel like you don't know
what you're shooting at.
Let me give you one shot
at that.
Okay, yes.
If I said to you, what are
your top three priorities,
starting tomorrow morning
when you go to work,
what would they be?
Um...Sorry,
I'm quite caught off guard.
Top three priorities.
Well, immediately
or in general? I'm sorry.
Immediate --
the next day,
the next week.
You're making her point.
You realize that.
[ chuckles ]
Well, I'm sorry.
Okay, I've never seen
an entrepreneur
ever in my life succeed
without being
hyper-focused
on exactly
what's most important.
For me, it certainly
wouldn't be a good fit,
and I'm sad to say
I'm out.
Well, I-I don't know
what to say
except other than I definitely
believe in Fort Magic.
Erika, you're going
200 miles an hour,
and I don't know what direction
you're going in.
I don't think you know what
direction you're going in.
I don't think
you're focused enough.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Erika, most families
in America
can't pay $199
for a child's toy.
They just can't.
I mean, that is really high
in the children's toy business.
If you want this to be big,
it has to be for under $100.
I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, Kevin.
Okay. Robert and Lori?
[ chuckles ]
I agree with Kevin.
I think that it's expensive
for what it is
and that you don't get
everything to put it together.
If it came at $199
with all of the fabric
and everything
that you have in front of us,
then that would be, to me,
a great price.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thanks, Lori.
HERJAVEC: You know,
one of the things
I've learned on "Shark Tank"
after five seasons
is there are some products
that when people come on,
the audience
is gonna buy in droves.
I think you're gonna sell
a ton of forts.
Are you making
an offer?
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.
Erika only has one chance
to make a deal.
I think you're gonna sell
a ton of forts.
O'LEARY: Are you making
an offer?
I am making an offer.
My challenge
is keeping you focused.
For me to be involved
with the business,
I would need to be
an equal partner with you.
$75,000 for 50%.
Okay, thank you, Robert.
Let me ask you this,
Robert.
For 50%, can you tell me
exactly what you think
that you'll be bringing
in terms of, like, moving
our distribution
and moving our sales for us
this year and in the future?
That's the smartest question
you've asked so far.
No, Erika,
that is a great question.
There's a bunch of things
that I think
my team and I
can help you focus on.
You got to sell the materials
with it and stuff like that.
Which will add cost.
So I think you could --
it will add cost, but I think
that's an option for people.
I would take it
to retail,
but I'd have
to see the packaging.
I just keep going back to,
I think you're gonna sell
a lot of forts.
50% is too much, unfortunately.
It's too much.
And I understand that, um --
O'LEARY: What would you sell
for $75,000,
given that he's made you
an offer, and that's
an achievement here?
Many people come on
"Shark Tank" with toys.
Very few get offers.
He's reflecting
the challenges ahead
in his risk profile
of your business,
and he wants to be paid
for the risk.
And you haven't done a really
good job in de-risking it,
because, as Barbara said,
you're scatterbrained,
you know?
No, no.
No.
CORCORAN: I didn't say
exactly that.
Okay. Mr. Wonderful,
I am not scatterbrained.
Hey, I'm just --
that's right.
You tell him.
I may be enthusiastic,
but I am actually very driven
and very hard-working,
and I have brought us this far.
Okay, then get focused
on the offer.
I don't know that
you're gonna like it, Robert,
but honestly, I was thinking
more something like 25%.
I'm not gonna change
from that.
I really appreciate it,
but I'm gonna have to say no.
CORCORAN: Good for you.
CUBAN: Good for you.
GREINER: Good for you,
and you'll make it.
Yeah.
Everybody's clapping.
They didn't make you an offer.
Oh, that wasn't a real offer,
Robert, and you know it.
Okay, how --
you -- you did not expect her
to take it, and you know it.
How do I deal with all
the other partners, Mark?
How do I deal
with the other partners?
You did not -- you did not
expect her to take it.
Just because she spent
$250,000 in the past
doesn't change
where we are right now today.
I'm just telling you it wasn't
a real offer, Robert.
All right.
Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Good luck
with everything.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Ha to you, Robert.
Look, Barbara,
I had the ability
to make an offer
that works for me.
O'LEARY: That business
is so screwed up.
You can't sell
a lot of these at $200.
Sure, you can.
That's ridiculous.
Sure, you can.
I don't think so.
For 200 bucks, that car should
have an engine in it.
[ chuckles ]
POPE: I'm actually
a very focused person.
Even though I may not answer
every question immediately,
that certainly doesn't take
anything away from the fact
that I know exactly what we're
doing with Fort Magic.
I know what our plan is. I know
where we are going forward.
And I'm just really excited
about the future
for our company.
