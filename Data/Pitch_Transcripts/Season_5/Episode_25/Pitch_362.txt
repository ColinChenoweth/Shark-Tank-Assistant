Hi.
My name is Chase Hoyt.
And this is my father.
I'm Bob Hoyt.
We're from Tucson, Arizona,
Well -- well, show us
how it works, Chase.
Sure. Absolutely.
We've had a few glasses
of wine.
Put the stopper in the top
of the bottle.
You can see that red indicator
is up right now
because, obviously, there's
still oxygen in there.
Pump the air out,
O'LEARY:
Yeah, but, Chase --
so you can visually see that
your wine is preserved.
I have, I don't know,
six cellars now...
Sure.
Chase,
what were your sales?
Last year,
we sold $150,000.
This year, we're on pace
to sell $300,000.
Chase, let me make it
really simple.
Not for me.
I'm out.
So, I use your competitor
every day
because I start my evening with
a single glass of Montrachet
which often comes out
of a new bottle.
CHASE: Right.
And then I hit the reds.
Mm-hmm.
So, I generally have
two bottles stopped.
The reason they have my business
is they have the distribution.
I think the problem with this
deal is the value put on it.
There's so much we could be
doing together
if you weren't
such greedy pigs.
[ chuckles ]
That's really
the problem here.
You've -- you've --
it's impossible
to give you $250,000 for --
I'd have to own
the whole company.
I'm sorry, but I'm out.
Okay.
CUBAN: Good luck, guys.
Thank you, Bob.
Thanks, Chase.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
GREINER: Good luck, guys.
All the best.
Thank you.
Kevin,
we're all friends here.
Yes.
We love you.
Yes.
You have a problem.
