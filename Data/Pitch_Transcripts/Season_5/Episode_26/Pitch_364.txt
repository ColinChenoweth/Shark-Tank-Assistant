Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,
My name is Brad scudder.
And I'm Rob Dickens.
We're from Boston,
Massachusetts,
our company
is Rugged Races,
and we're seeking $1 million
for 10% of our company.
So, what is
Rugged Races?
We operate a popular
5k obstacle-course race series
in 20 cities across the country
called rugged maniac.
At our events,
participants of all ages,
all genders,
all shapes and sizes,
will complete
a challenging running course
featuring
25 epic obstacles.
But these aren't
the pop-up kiddie obstacles
you'll see
at our competitors' events.
At rugged maniac,
participants will climb over
towers of shipping containers,
rocket down
100-foot water slides,
crawl through tunnels of mud,
and even jump over fire,
all while running
through a combination
of forest, fields, ski slopes,
and even motocross tracks.
In short, rugged maniac
strikes the perfect balance
between fun
and physicality
with our award-winning courses
and our day-long festival.
So which one of you sharks
is ready to get rugged with us?
And just to show you
what we're all about,
we've got this video clip
right here.
[ rock music plays ]
Wow.
I didn't even know
you existed,
but I know about
your competitor.
You mean like
tough mudder?
How are you different
than that?
We're -- we're different
in this sense.
Basically, tough mudder
is a 12-mile course, right,
with about 20 obstacles.
We have 25 obstacles
over three miles.
So it's more about the obstacles
and less about the running.
And being
a three-mile course,
it's much more accessible
to the general public
than something like
a 12-mile course would be.
Are you saying this
is a tamer version of that --
something that Barbara
would do?
Oh, I could handle
the 12 miles.
It's this little short guy
over here
that wouldn't have a shot
at it.
Uh, but we get people
of all shapes and sizes
at our events, truly,
from 77-year-old guys to,
you know,
mother/daughter teams,
14-year-old and up.
Is it more workout
or more party?
We think we strike
an excellent balance
between the workout
and the party.
Because it's a shorter race,
it takes, you know,
an average of an hour
or a little bit more to finish.
People are -- are exhausted,
but they're still exhilarated.
Do people bring alcohol?
No.
No. No.
Or do you sell it?
Yes, we sell alcohol.
HERJAVEC:
You sell alcohol?
It's a big outdoor fest--
it's a big outdoor festival.
Oh, hell yeah!
Pump, pounds, puke, right?
Exactly. Exactly.
I mean, it's fun.
It's -- it's a fun event.
So, what are sales gonna be
this year?
This year --
$4.2 million.
Wow.
Wow. Good for you.
Ooh.
And how many courses?
20 cities nationwide.
How much out of the $4.2 million
did you profit?
$1 million.
But next year,
without investment,
we're projecting
$6.5 million in revenue,
$2.2 million
in profits.
Talk about the industry.
There's some monsters
out there.
Sure, sure.
You know,
what's the difference?
So, basically,
you've got -- you've got
two kind of at the top --
the warrior dash 5k,
tough mudder 12 mile.
And why have they gotten
so much bigger than you guys?
First movers
in the market.
And how big are they, rob?
How big are they?
They have, like,
40 events.
45 events
across the country.
HERJAVEC: But -- but in terms
of revenue, take a guess. How
big would they be?
I think they're
about $30 million.
So would you guys say
this industry's
about $100 million a year?
Much larger.
Oh, more than that.
Rob, what are -- what are you
gonna do with the $1 million?
We've, uh --
we've taken that money
and invested it in other brands
that we own. um...
What -- so, now, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
W-what do you mean,
other brands?
DICKENS:
Wait, wait. No, no.
What are we gonna do
with the $1 million
that we would get from you?
JOHN: Yes.
Oh.
Sorry. What million
were you talking about, Brad?
I thought you wanted to know
what we did with our profits.
Yeah.
Well, we want
to know that, too.
Oh, well, all right, great.
What did you do
with the $1 million in profit?
DICKENS: Let me show you
exactly what we've done
with that other money.
Okay, let's see.
JOHN: Let's see it.
All right, here it is.
[ rock music plays ]
Oh, you guys are doing
these things?
It's so stupid.
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
HERJAVEC:
That's a great idea.
Rob, explain to me
what I saw.
You saw running with the bulls
here in the U.S.
Okay.
Anybody get hurt?
We had some
minor injuries --
couple concussions,
a broken arm.
The injury rate --
[ laughter ]
People paid for this?
DICKENS: Oh, yeah.
About the same prices
as rugged maniac -- about $50.
But is that part
of this deal?
It can be.
That's a separate --
that's a separate company.
Separate LLC?
Lawyers, lawyers, lawyers.
Have you never
seen the show?!
Greedy, greedy pigs.
We have. We have.
I give you $1 million --
I don't -- I don't get to wet
my beak on the bull deal?
no.
Of course
we get the bulls!
Are you --
are you guys kidding?
No.
Come on.
You can't be serious.
Of course
that's not gonna work.
They're full of bull.
Now, I give you a chance
to change your mind.
DICKENS: Okay.
We would want more
money for you to get
involved with the bulls.
Why?!
So, the bull run is --
is a separate entity.
All right,
why don't we entertain it?
How much more would it be
to be pa--
$2 million
for 10% of the bull run.
$2 million for the bull
and $1 million for the rugged?
Yeah.
So 3 million bucks
gets 10% of both?
Yep.
Brad, what are the sales
in the second company?
$280,000
at the first event.
But d-do you realize
that your expertise
is not rugged maniac.
Your expertise is in putting on
adventure events.
The bull run is just another
variant of this same thing.
DICKENS:
That's exactly right.
And so, the growth potential
with this company
is not just
within rugged maniac.
Guys, what's the cash flow
gonna be next year in --
under your optimistic scenario
for both companies?
Whew! I mean, we
think they can be
a $20-million event this year.
Guys,
I like the business,
but if I come in
and give you money
and all of a sudden, it's like,
"where's Brad and rob?"
"oh, they're chasing
the bulls," right,
what am I gonna say to you
as an investor
when I'm not
getting your full attention?
"I want a piece
of the bulls."
O'LEARY: No kidding.
No, that's not
what I'm gonna say.
I'm gonna say,
"they can die," right?
I want a return
on my investments,
or I'm suing your ass because
you have a conflict of interest.
No investor says, "Oh, the
existing business is dying?
Sell me a piece
of the new one."
O'LEARY: No, you don't do that
to investors.
You align your interests
with them 100%.
When you start talking about
$1 million,
you don't screw around.
DICKENS: Right, right.
That's a real investment.
Sure.
HERJAVEC: Rob, the other --
the -- the element for me --
I love the idea.
I also really love the fact
that you're building a customer
base for the other events
that you can hold later on.
For me, they're together.
Here's an offer for you.
Sure.
Both businesses combined --
I'll give you $1.5 million
for 25% of the entire thing.
Okay.
Is that the only offer
that we have?
Mark, you said you were
interested. Would you --
CUBAN: No, I'm very --
I love the one business.
I-if I didn't know
about this other business,
I'd probably make an offer
right now, right?
Sure.
But I want to hear
what you say to rob.
I think I know, but --
I think I'm giving you
a fair offer.
I think the business is worth,
what, six times ebitda --
1.5 times revenue,
roughly.
Right.
And I'm pricing in.
I think that's generous.
I'm pricing it in
because I see the upside
in the other business.
Okay.
Asking for $1 million
for this business
was already challenging.
Having another agenda
and another business
on the other side,
my gut feeling is and my
instinct is that no matter what,
I would be screwed working
with you, I wouldn't trust you.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you for your
consideration.
You know, a funny thing happened
to me watching you here today.
You came out here, I thought,
"what good-looking guys.
Man, they look the part.
What a great video."
but then
somewhere along the way,
the surprise of the bulls
and, "Oh, yeah.
we'll wrap that into the deal."
And I don't think maybe
you intended it that way,
but for some reason,
you lost my trust.
But either way, I'm out.
Sorry to hear that, but we thank
you for your consideration.
Well, guys, you have --
you have, uh, one --
we have an offer...
You have an offer
on the table.
...From -- yes, we --
yes, we do.
What are you gonna do?
And that's an offer
that's...Lower than
what we had wanted, but --
no, let me make you an offer
higher than what you want.
Well, no, of course.
I get it.
[ laughs ]
Anyone else want to throw
an offer in the ring?
I'm still listening.
Well, Mark,
your concern is
that you -- you want us to focus
all our energies on one.
CUBAN: No, no, no.
it's not that.
You came in, and you tried
to sell us one business,
and you
separated the two.
You're overvaluing the other
business, in my opinion.
And if you have such a-a
high opinion of that business,
that's probably where a lot
of your attention's going to be.
And as an investor,
I don't think it's worth
the -- the value
that you're assigning to it,
because you've had one event
for $200,000.
Because the --
Mark, are you saying
my value's too high?
Yes.
Wow. Now Mark's
making me nervous about,
"am I overpaying?"
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.
Robert has made an offer,
but Mark's concerns may
have caused a change of heart.
Because the --
Mark, are you saying
my value's too high?
Yes.
Wow. Now Mark's
making me nervous about,
"am I overpaying?"
$1.5 million -- 25%.
That gives you about
a $6 million value
for the combined businesses.
The longer we wait,
the -- the less comfortable
I'm starting to feel.
Let me cloudy the waters
a little bit here
and maybe give you a --
well, let -- let --
tell me what --
hang on, Robert.
you may want to hear this.
I think your offer
should be for 33% -- 1/3.
You because a third partner
with these guys.
And then I'd go in
50/50 with you.
[ laughs ]
Hmm.
I'm good with that.
I like going up to 1/3.
$1.5 million for 1/3
of the combined businesses.
I'm with you, uncle Kevin.
Yeah, I thought
you might be,
because I think
you did overpay.
[ laughs ]
rob, isn't it interesting
what's happened?
You had an offer at here.
Now we're here.
Sure.
The longer we stay here...
So, what I would be
willing to do...
Is $1.5 million,
but it's for 25%
of the two companies combined.
Okay.
We're going to go discuss this,
consider both offers,
and come back.
I'm not sure what there is
to discuss, Mark.
You made a better offer
than we did.
Yeah, Mark made the same
as your initial.
The challenge is,
when they come back,
do you drop this dead weight
right here
and go back
to your initial offer?
Then you're overpaying.
I don't think they're
gonna take either offer.
Oh, I think they will.
O'LEARY: Okay, gentlemen, let's
summarize what's happened here.
You have two distinct offers.
The first, from Mr. Cuban,
is for $1.5 million
for 25% of your company.
Which, by the way,
was the exact same offer I made,
and he spent half an hour
telling you how bad
your business is.
I know, I know.
O'LEARY: The other offer
is for the same amount of money
for 33 1/3%
of your business.
DICKENS: Mm-hmm.
What are you going to do?
We went out there
and discussed it.
We'd -- we'd like to eventually
strike a deal with you.
We wanted to come back in
and say,
listen, we do $2 million
for -- for the 25%.
Instead of doing that,
we'd like to split it in the
middle and go $1.75 million.
Deal.
Deal? All right.
JOHN: I told you guys.
Go to work, baby.
Looking forward to it.
Looking forward to it.
Looking forward to it.
Absolutely.
We'll make some money.
Knew you'd lose out, but,
Robert, why did you do that?
And thank you
for your considerations.
Thanks, guys.
I'm fired up.
Thank you.
DICKENS:
We are very excited.
We took that offer
from Mark
because we realized that Mark
offers more than just money.
Mark offers his experience,
he offers his connections.
You know, only great things
can come from it.
Well done.
$1.75 million?
For 25%.
I'm actually surprised that
they came down in the valuation.
Hmm.
[ exhales sharply ]
NARRATOR: Last season,
father-and-son entrepreneurs
Keith and Brandon marz
pitched the sharks a new way
of getting your daily vitamins.
We came here wanting
to be partners with you.
Together, we can make
a lot of money.
You got a deal, Lori.
GREINER: Great.
Whoo!
This is gonna be great.
Very excited.
NARRATOR: Let's see how
marz sprays is doing now.
Business has been booming
since we did a deal with Lori.
All right, guys.
Unbelievable start to our
international success.
Before "Shark Tank,"
we had about $150,000 in sales.
Since "Shark Tank,"
in just over a year,
we have over $4 million
of sales.
KEITH: And we know
that $10 million
is just around
the corner.
BRANDON: Looks good.
Over the last year,
we've spent a lot of time
fine-tuning
our product.
We've changed
the packaging,
we've enhanced
the flavor profile.
These products are perfect
for consumers now.
That's really good.
There it is.
[ gasps ]
BRANDON:
Lori has helped us
get into two
of the largest retailers
in the world --
Walmart and Walgreens.
You guys repackaged
this beautifully.
We are now in thousands
of stores nationwide.
I knew it was a hero,
but to hit $4 million
that fast --
unbelievable.
This is just
the beginning, guys.
Yes!
Yay!
Coming to "Shark Tank" was truly
an incredible experience.
It allowed us to showcase
our products to the world,
and it opened doors that we
never would've thought
could've been opened.
NARRATOR: Next up is a product
created by a college student
to help him excel at school.
Welcome to class,
everyone.
my wardrobe got
a major upgrade.
I love fashion so much,
I decided to turn my passion
into a business.
It's a high-end
fashion accessory
that will have you
smiling and styling.
We could put these
on our website.
My fashion idol
is Daymond John,
and when I grow up,
I want to be just like him.
I need an investment from the
sharks to hire manufacturers.
My strongest suit
is designing,
and I need a team to bounce
my fresh ideas off of.
If I don't get a deal from
the sharks, I'll be very sad.
I need
to keep this dream alive,
because my passion
is your fashion.
Hello.
But the problem was, I couldn't
find any bow ties that I liked,
so my grandma,
she showed me how to sew,
and then Mo's Bows
became.
Now, we've actually
brought y'all
some amazing bow ties
to have, feel, and see
the quality of product
we offer.
Bow ties are classic,
but Mo's Bows bow ties...
Thank you.
...We like to call them
classic swag.
But by investing
in Mo's Bows today
means investing
in the future,
because we don't
just make bow ties.
Mo's story has inspired
people young and old
to tap into their passion.
Yes, I give everyone
the same advice --
figure out
what you like doing,
and find out how you can make
money doing it.
Figure out, find out.
Figure out, find out.
It's that simple.
Sharks, I know that, together,
we can make a lot of money
and make this business
really, really successful
by helping people look good
and feel good in my bow ties.
So, I only just have
one question --
who's coming with me?
[ laughs ]
You're so charming.
Thank you.
Are you selling
any of these bow ties, mo?
Yes.
How many and to who?
I've sold, uh, 2,000.
2,000? Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Did you hand-make
2,000 bow ties?
Yes. Me and my grandma.
Yourself?
But you're doing it all
in your house right now?
Yeah.
You're running
a sweatshop.
Yes.
[ laughter ]
How old are you, mo?
I'm 11 years old.
Wow.
How long did it take you
to sell the 2,000?
We've been in business
for two years.
mo started when he was 9.
This year, we've sold
a total of 1,500 ties,
at a total of $55,000
in selling ties.
$55,000? mo.
Wow.
CORCORAN: Who are you
selling them to?
We sell online,
and we have 11 different stores
across the South.
How do people
find you, mo?
They find me
from different trunk shows.
My mom posted it
on Facebook and magazines.
I've been in
  the Oprah magazine.
moRRIS: So he's gotten
a lot of publicity.
Wow.
How much does it cost you
to make one,
and how much
do you sell it for?
What it costs for me
to make one is $6 to $10,
and they range
from $45 to $55.
mo, why did you decide
on bow ties?
Because I really like
to dress up,
and, also,
my dad and my granddad,
they were
really dapper men.
[ laughs ]
And bow ties make you look good
and feel good.
I feel like I'm watching,
standing right before me,
Daymond John working with his
mother, making his clothes...
you know, baby D.J.
