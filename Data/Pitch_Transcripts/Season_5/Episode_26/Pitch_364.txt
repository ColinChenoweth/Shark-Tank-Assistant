My name is Mr. Hiltbrand,
and I'll be your teacher today.
Do you ever find yourself
struggling to focus
with all of today's
many distractions,
like McKay over here?
Yeah, well, welcome to the life
of a college student.
HILTBRAND: So, to
the four sharks that thought
that I was just selling
snake oil,
all I say is try my product.
If you still don't feel it,
then fine.
But just try it
before you knock it.
Do you like more patterns,
or do you like more solids?
