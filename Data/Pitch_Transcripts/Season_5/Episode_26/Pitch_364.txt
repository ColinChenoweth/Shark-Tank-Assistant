My name is Mr. Hiltbrand,
and I'll be your teacher today.
Do you ever find yourself
struggling to focus
with all of today's
many distractions,
like McKay over here?
Yeah, well, welcome to the life
of a college student.
These distractions -- they've
got no effect on Jess and I.
And that's because
we've taken Cerebral Success.
Cerebral success
is an amazing brain supplement
that works to boost
the four areas of brain power.
It'll revitalize your focus,
memory, mental agility,
and overall brain health.
Trevor, you forgot
to take your pills.
You didn't even tell me
what you want.
So, today,
I'm looking for $75,000
in exchange for 20% equity
in my business.
Didn't forget my pills.
That was coming later.
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
So, Cerebral Success contains
ginkgo biloba,
schizandrol-a, omega 3 dha,
huperzine, vinpocetine,
choline, and bacopa.
Yeah, Kevin. Bacopa.
But, sharks, pills?
They're old-school.
Introducing Cerebral Success
brain-boosting shots.
These little shots
will contain the same
tested and loved formula
as their older brother,
while being the perfect
point-of-purchase item
at every campus in every
bookstore nationwide.
Sharks, I need your help
to make Cerebral Success
a worldwide success.
Can you show us all
a bottle?
Sure.
So these are
just prototypes, so...
There's nothing
in here, right?
HERJAVEC: How did you
come up with it?
So, I came up with it
while I was a college student.
I, uh -- I always kind of fo--
struggled to focus, and, uh --
no kidding.
Really?
[ chuckles ] Yep.
And so, I-I was kind of mixing
my own different ingredients,
different supplements,
for my own purpose, and --
and so, is there any scientific
proof that this works?
All of my ingredients have had
clinical studies done on them.
No, I know, but the --
the combined product --
which means
absolutely nothing.
Have you done any studies
or any tests
that the combined product
works?
We've had
over 60,000, um...
Can't remember?
Can't remember?
60-- 60,000 servings, sorry.
You're not doing yourself
any favors, Trevor.
What were your sales
in the pills?
So, we've sold 6--
we-we've sold almost 900 bottles
in the pill form.
Dollar-wise?
6-- about $60,000.
You're selling those
for 70 bucks a pop?
Yep.
Can I see that? That's --
check this out.
so --
what's your cost
on it?
63 cents.
Um, it's about --
it's about $10.
We have really expensive
and high-quality ingredients.
All the ingredients
listed there --
O'LEARY:
Trevor, if I go into gnc
and I go to the sector
that gives me supplements
to enhance focus,
mental abilities,
there's plenty
of offerings.
Why are you
different?
So, we're specifically designed
for college students.
most brain sup--
what?
How's that possible?
So, most brain supplements
are more geared
towards elderly people.
Like Barbara.
[ laughs ]
Let me explain.
Can I explain?
Can I explain?
So, my product
has these four areas,
whereas most --
most brain supplements,
they only target
brain health.
Mine throws in
the mental agility.
Trevor, how do you
sell this today?
You're at $60,000 in sales,
which, by the way --
all online.
All online?
Yep.
So, how do you know
it works?
Reviews from our customers.
We've had --
that's it?
So, we're averaging about
three bottles per customer.
Customers keep buy--
coming back.
So, if I buy this, how many
pills do I have to take?
How long before
my memory improves or I get --
immediately you feel the effect
and you do better on your test?
So, it's -- it's designed
to feel in the short term
and for, like, effects
in the long term.
So if you take it once --
say you're cramming
for a test --
it'll help you recall more
information in the morning.
If you take it
consistently,
it'll have long-term benefits
for your memory,
for your focus,
for your mental health.
Look, you -- you can -- you can
convince anybody of anything
for a short period of time.
You don't --
you don't really believe
that this is gonna lead
to Cerebral Success, do you?
I-i really do believe it.
I picked a collection
of -- of --
of supplemental ingredients
that I wanted in my product,
and then I had
the professionals,
the manufacturers,
the gmp-certified facilities
help me put it together,
make sure it's all legit,
make sure they -- they don't
interact with each other.
But what about a kid
who's studying for an exam,
he's a nervous wreck,
he's been drinking all night,
and he takes 15, 20
of these pills?
He'll have the dance
of the flaming sphincter.
[ laughter ]
No, let me ask you,
though.
That's it.
Now, what is the downside
to a substantial overdose?
Just like
any other supplement,
if -- if you're super-sensitive
to caffeine --
JOHN: So, Trev, I don't want
to discredit you,
and I know, you know,
you're a young entrepreneur,
and you just want to get out
there and make some money
and -- and -- and work
on your company,
but you just don't have
any credibility in the market.
I'm out.
Okay.
Yeah, Trevor,
I, you know --
but they're all successful.
This is a massive,
massive market, with --
Trevor, just because
something's a-a massive market
doesn't mean
that your --
the demand's not there?
No, no, no.
H-h-hey, Trevor, what?
You're gonna stand there
and you're gonna start telling
me about the business
just because there's
a massive market?
I was gonna tell you
about the demand.
Focus used to be
a struggle for me.
Hey, Trevor, anyb--
anybody can sell anything.
I'm -- I'm not
a big believer in it.
Let me paint one -- let me paint
one quick -- quick picture.
Look, I -- before I forget,
I'm out.
CORCORAN:
[ chuckles ]
for those of you
who are still in,
let me paint a picture
real quick.
Imagine you're
a college student.
Imagine you're going
to wherever they sell
convenience items on campus,
and they see this product --
something that says,
"boosts memory, boosts focus,
boosts mental alertness,
and boosts brain health."
whether -- whether you think my
credentials are there are not,
do you think that they would buy
that product or not?
JOHN:
That's not what we're saying.
We're saying that
in our position,
we just don't
necessarily feel
that you have
the credibility to do that.
I don't even think it's
about his credibility.
This is about ethics
and integrity.
Yes.
Have you read
the warning on here?
Yes. I mean, I've writ--
I wr-- I wrote the warning.
"before taking, consult
a health-care professional
"prior to consumption.
"or if you have any pre-existing
medical conditions
or any prescription medications,
do not use this product."
I mean, you're not --
that's on --
but that's on everything.
but why am I saying that?
No, that's just
to protect myself.
That's just to protect
myself from --
JOHN: It's all about ethics.
We care about ethics here.
And if you really want to deal
with a shark without ethics,
then why don't you
just talk to Kevin?
[ laughter ]
look, I-I mean, I feel like
I'm a very ethical person.
I would never want to, you know,
mislead anybody.
Look, I --
Trevor, you know what I hated
most about your presentation?
What's that?
There's good money, and then
there's dirty money.
I hated your example
where you said
a college student
who didn't have enough sleep --
would they shell out money
for something like this?
And I'm amazed
that you're making
a conscious decision
to go after this kind of money.
There's a lot of ways
to be successful in life.
Why take this path?
Because I believe in it.
I mean, I've used it,
and it works.
And I've had customer
who have used it --
HILTBRAND: So, to
the four sharks that thought
that I was just selling
snake oil,
all I say is try my product.
If you still don't feel it,
then fine.
But just try it
before you knock it.
Do you like more patterns,
or do you like more solids?
