and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
is a reinvention
of an ancient beverage.
Hello, sharks.
I'm Jon fotheringham.
And I'm
Dr. Eric durtschi.
We're the creators
of crio,
two of America's
biggest passions --
For thousands of years,
the Maya of central America
prepared a chocolaty drink
called xocoatl --
the drink of the gods.
After years
of experimenting,
I reinvented
this delicious drink
made with
100% cocoa beans.
DURTSCHI: We've got
a couple of things there.
Crio can be brewed at home
or in coffee shops.
Now, you can
have it plain.
The one that you're
going to have that's iced
is called iced coconut crio.
This has a little bit of cream
added to it.
Oh!
Ugh!
Ugh.
Ugh, I don't like taste
of that.
Not a fan, guys. I'm out.
Not for me. I'm out.
JOHN:
Yeah, it really is horrible.
I'm out.
Okay, so this is the shortest
pitch in "Shark Tank" history.
I'm gonna let you
have a chance to explain
why you're worth
$10 million.
Well, this year, we're on track
to do $1.5 million in sales.
We've sold over 276,000 units
over the past two years.
We should be in 1,000 new stores
in the coming six months.
We've done
hundreds of demos.
I would say
that 9 out of the 10 people
that try it in the store
like it.
What do you think
about that?
Hey, look,
just 'cause I don't like it
doesn't mean there
aren't people who do like it.
O'LEARY: Which one
of my assumptions is wrong?
This is a commodity.
You're en-- you're --
you're encouraging America
to come here and ask
for stupid valuations?
All I can tell you is the first
615 times I drank beer,
I thought
it tasted horrible, right?
Nothing to do with the taste.
The valuation was insane.
Yeah, but, Kevin, you're basing
on the value today. They're --
oh, really?
I want to pay --
hallelujah. this is America.
do anything to make a buck.
I'm kind of confused
on why you guys
are painting this
as a -- as super-unethical --
O'LEARY: I am not --
I'm trying to figure out,
can I make a return in
the supplemental market
with your strategy?
But you haven't articulated one.
I'm out.
Thank you.
