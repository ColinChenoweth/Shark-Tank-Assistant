My name
is moziah Bridges,
and I am the C.E.O.
of Mo's Bows.
...In hopes
of getting an investment
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.
Who would like to experience
the drink of the gods?
Oh!
Ugh!
People paid for this?
NARRATOR: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
We're on track to do
$1.5 million in sales.
I believe I am an n.B.T. --
The next big thing -- and --
oh, my goodness. did you just
say "n.b.t. -- next big thing"?
Yeah.
NARRATOR: If the sharks
hear a great idea...
I smell a royalty deal.
NARRATOR: ...They're ready to
invest using their own money.
And they're willing
to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
What are sales gonna be
this year?
$4.2 million.
I'll give you $1.5 million.
I'd like to split it in the
middle and go $1.75 million.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
HERJAVEC: Wow.
CORCORAN: Wow.
Under what planet would that
make sense to an investor?
I promise you, we will do a
minimum of $10 million in sales.
What?
Oh!
Oh!
This is the shortest pitch
in "Shark Tank" history.
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.
Daymond John is
a fashion and branding expert
who grew
his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
fashion brand fubu,
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.
My name is moziah Bridges.
And I'm Mo's mom, tramica.
And we live
in Memphis, Tennessee.
These are
some nice suits.
Fashion!
It just speaks to me,
and I like to look good,
and I like to feel good.
Mo's always been
a snappy dresser.
Even when he was 4 and I allowed
him to dress himself...
Looking good.
...He would choose to ride
his bike in a suit and tie.
You're doing
a great job.
BRIDGES: My grandmother was
a seamstress for a long time.
She taught me how to sew,
and after that,
My name
is moziah Bridges,
and I am the C.E.O.
of Mo's Bows handmade bow ties.
And I brought with me
my lovely mom-ager.
Hi, sharks.
I'm tramica morris.
And we're here today
seeking $50,000
in exchange
for 20% of our company.
Sharks, I always -- I mean,
always -- like to dress nice.
Even when I was little,
I would wear a suit and tie
just to go play
on the playground.
BRIDGES: Maybe.
...His first hats
in the kitchen.
HERJAVEC: Oh.
What do you think, Daymond?
Is that your new protégé?
It could be.
I'm you in 30 years.
I wasn't doing that type
of business
at that age,
so congratulations.
What do you need
the $50,000 for?
We want to use
the $50,000
to go home and, um,
secure a manufacturer.
Do you anticipate a large
amount of orders, or are
you saying
that you already have orders
and you want to take the money
to utilize it for that?
Absolutely, both. We, uh,
currently have 11 stores.
We have about five more stores
that are waiting.
Any big-box players? Any large
fashion players interested?
Right now, he's reached out
to Macy's and Dillard's
and some
of the big-box players,
but right now it's
in specialty boutiques
throughout the South.
I'm gonna make
the assumption
that you're trying to build
a brand -- Mo's Bows.
I get it...
Mm-hmm.
...Because these
are expensive.
This is not
a cheap bow tie.
CUBAN: mo,
you're teaching Kevin
a very valuable lesson
in pricing elasticity.
Do you know what pricing
elasticity is?
No.
What that means is,
when you have more demand
than you can supply,
what do you do?
You raise your prices.
When you go
to manufacturing,
do you not lose a certain amount
of cache around it?
Because today,
it's handcrafted Mo's Bows.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
If you have it manufactured,
is it still handcrafted?
I believe so.
Well, the -- the company that
we're working with in Memphis,
it's a lady that used to own
a sewing factory.
They're sewing,
they're cutting, so...
I see. And how many
can they make a day?
At least 500 a week.
What will your grandmother say,
mo, when you fire her?
Will she be upset?
Well, my grandma,
she's just funny.
She's just, "oh, okay."
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
yeah, she's --
she's --
at 80 years old,
she's fine...
chill. everything.
...With pretty much
whatever we --
you're making an 80-year-old
woman work 10 hours a day?
[ laughter ]
Well, she loves me.
She loves the feel
of my cheeks the most.
JOHN:
mo, mo, are you gonna --
are you planning
on expanding the line
to other haberdasheries
and -- and other things?
Yes, I'm planning
to have my own clothing line
by the time I'm 20.
20? Okay, good.
Nine years.
Why do you believe
that you need an investor
instead of growing the business
steadily on your own
and making all the profit
for yourself?
Because I believe I am an
n.B.T. -- The next big thing --
and because I've been in --
oh, my goodness. did you just
say "n.b.t. -- next big thing"?
Yes.
[ laughter ]
moRRIS:
And we feel like,
with your funding
and with your connections,
we can grow faster,
we can really get
the brand out there.
And we want to take the world
of male accessories
and kind of turn it
upside down.
We want cool socks. We want
fun bow ties, fun neckties.
Guys, I'll get it started.
Um, I -- mo, you are
the next big thing.
Thank you.
I'm excited for you,
but as advanced
as my fashion sense is,
I don't know
if I'm the guy to help you.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Mo, I-I appreciate you
coming out here today.
Thank you.
But, uh, I don't think I'm
the right partner for you.
There might be somebody else
on this panel
who might be
a better fit.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Barbara, Kevin,
Daymond?
I'll tell you what I'm
smelling right here. [ sniffs ]
HERJAVEC: What?
I smell a royalty deal.
NARRATOR: Two sharks are out,
but Kevin may be interested.
O'LEARY: I'll tell you what I'm
smelling right here. [ sniffs ]
HERJAVEC: What?
I smell a royalty deal...
[ laughs ]
Oh, my God.
...'cause your margins are
so high, they're incredible.
You could afford
to pay me $3 a tie
if I give you the $50,000.
don't do it, mo.
There's your first offer.
I'll give you the $50,000.
I don't want
any equity in Mo's Bows.
I want $3 every time
you sell a tie.
CORCORAN:
Here's my take on it.
Um, it's a family business...
HERJAVEC:
Hmm. That's true.
...And you're doing
very well.
Mm-hmm.
So it's not like you're
standing alone.
You're surrounded by people
that love you, support you,
and they're working
for you.
moRRIS: Okay.
And you're hardly grown-up.
[ chuckles ]
I honestly don't think
you need anybody's help.
I think you're
on to something here.
Your margins are great.
You're selling them.
If you could keep
the publicity going...
Mm-hmm.
...I think that is amazing,
and you being who you are,
why wouldn't everybody write
about you?
Yeah.
Right?
Absolutely.
For those reasons, I'm out.
JOHN: So, I-In 1989,
I was offered $10,000
for 40% of my company,
and my company was only a couple
of hats I made, right?
10 years later,
that would've been worth,
to somebody else,
$40 million.
I'm glad
I didn't take that money.
I strongly suggest
that you don't take on investors
at this time.
So I will guarantee
to mentor you,
but I will not give you
the money at this time.
And I think the mentoring
is way more valuable
than the money.
Absolutely.
So, in regards to the deal,
I'm out.
Okay.
In regards to mentoring,
I'm in.
Perfect.
And don't do this deal.
[ chuckles ]
O'LEARY: You know, here's
the thing, mo. I believed
in you from the beginning.
And the way I'm showing my
belief is I'm writing a check.
Everybody else -- talk.
You also will have
Mr. Wonderful as a mentor
instead of myself.
No, no,
you can also mentor.
Wow.
I won't -- I won't --
I wouldn't be able to do that
because you -- it will show that
you're not listening to me.
I want to take you
down the path that I want.
Wow! Listen to that.
Wow. Good move, Daymond.
He's telling you
not to take my money.
So once you do
10,000 ties,
think about sending
this guy $30,000
every time
you do your ties...
And you would've made
on that --
...Forever.
Mo, I-I know --
Mo, I know
it's a very -- it's a very,
very difficult decision.
What are you
going to do?
Well, we appreciate
all of your comments and
all of your feedback.
Um, Mr. Wonderful, Kevin,
we appreciate your offer,
but we're going
to have to decline.
Yes.
Yes.
HERJAVEC: Yay!
Daymond, we would love
to -- to work with you
as a mentor...
absolutely.
...And take Mo to --
to the next level
of where --
of where he could go.
Do you agree
with that, Mo?
Mo? Okay.
Mm-hmm.
mo, you're thinking about it,
and mom doesn't like it.
I'm checking
with the C.E.O.
mo is the C.E.O., but I'm
the C.E.O. Of mo, so...
JOHN: There you go.
CUBAN: Good luck, guys.
Thank you guys so much.
We really appreciate
the offer. Thank you.
Good luck.
Congratulations, mo.
All right, and I'll be
speaking to you.
All right, perfect.
BRIDGES: I walked out with
Daymond John as my mentor.
Ba-zam!
I'm on my way.
And you know what I like
about him?
He said he's gonna do clothing
by the age of 20.
Nine years. He's not thinking
tomorrow, tomorrow.
He's gonna develop
his business.
I think you did him
a huge disservice.
I think you're an animal.
No, listen. I think that
would've worked beautifully.
[ chuckles ]
