and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
is a reinvention
of an ancient beverage.
Hello, sharks.
I'm Jon fotheringham.
And I'm
Dr. Eric durtschi.
We're the creators
of crio,
and we're seeking
$1 million
in exchange for a 10%
equity stake in our business.
Imagine
if you could combine
two of America's
biggest passions --
coffee and chocolate --
into one amazing new drink
and tap into the $75 billion
coffee, tea,
and chocolate markets.
For thousands of years,
the Maya of central America
prepared a chocolaty drink
called xocoatl --
the drink of the gods.
After years
of experimenting,
I reinvented
this delicious drink
made with
100% cocoa beans.
And it's
incredibly healthy.
Crio has zero fat, zero sugar,
zero cholesterol,
only 10 calories per cup,
and more antioxidants
than pomegranate juice
or blueberries.
It also contains a natural
stimulant called theobromine
that gives you long-lasting,
gentle energy.
So you can say goodbye
to the spike and crash
of jittery energy
you get from coffee.
In short, crio is cocoa
the way it was meant to be.
Now, who would like
to experience the
drink of the gods?
All right, sharks,
you're really in for a treat.
For $1 million,
it better be a hell of a treat.
DURTSCHI: We've got
a couple of things there.
Crio can be brewed at home
or in coffee shops.
Now, you can
have it plain.
The one that you're
going to have that's iced
is called iced coconut crio.
This has a little bit of cream
added to it.
Oh!
Ugh!
Ugh.
Ugh, I don't like taste
of that.
Not a fan, guys. I'm out.
Not for me. I'm out.
JOHN:
Yeah, it really is horrible.
I'm out.
Okay, so this is the shortest
pitch in "Shark Tank" history.
I'm gonna let you
have a chance to explain
why you're worth
$10 million.
Well, this year, we're on track
to do $1.5 million in sales.
We've sold over 276,000 units
over the past two years.
We should be in 1,000 new stores
in the coming six months.
We've done
hundreds of demos.
I would say
that 9 out of the 10 people
that try it in the store
like it.
What do you think
about that?
Hey, look,
just 'cause I don't like it
doesn't mean there
aren't people who do like it.
O'LEARY: Which one
of my assumptions is wrong?
This is a commodity.
Anybody can package this
and sell it.
No one's ever heard of it,
so you've got a marketing job
from hell.
Why are you asking
for $1 million for 10%?
How -- how -- under what
scenario on what planet
would that make sense
to an investor?
This is actually a
product that we've had
a lot of interest from
from some
very large companies.
I've actually found references
over 150 years old
from people
who have tried to do this.
And they've not been able
to do that for a few reasons.
The roasting is something
that's completely different
from what's done
with normal chocolate products
as well
as coffee products.
Oh, so you're telling me
the process
by which you make your crio bean
is proprietary and unique?
Absolutely.
And that is something
we have patent pending.
Who are you selling it to?
Through what medium?
FOTHERINGHAM: 60% of our sales
are in grocery stores.
We're in 500 stores
currently --
on slate to be in 1,500 stores
by the end of the year.
Do you have reorders
in this short period of time?
Absolutely.
And I know your experience
is different,
but to be honest
with you,
a lot of times,
people try it their first try,
and you don't know
what to expect.
You're either thinking
hot chocolate
or you're thinking
coffee.
This is neither one
of those.
O'LEARY:
Why is that a good thing?
You have to educate
an entire generation
that they should be
drinking this,
supposedly, because it's better
for them than coffee
and that the taste is,
at least, equivalent.
I mean, I can see people --
I think we have
five opinions here,
and everybody thought
the taste --
no, not me. I thought
the taste was fine.
What you were expecting
was something that tasted
like coffee.
No, that's not what
I was expecting at all.
I was looking for
a coffee replacement,
not knowing
what to expect.
It just tastes like cocoa beans
mashed up, ripe,
and hot water put
in, and there wasn't
enough cocoa put in.
Well, Mark, they're --
they're selling $1.5 million.
Some people like it.
So, here's the thing --
how much you making
on the $1.5 million?
This year,
we should do $150,000.
So let's just
think about this.
That's awesome.
That's all that matters, right?
You're asking me to pay
100 times your profit.
Well, and so,
part of that is --
I mean,
I have to punish you now.
Why in the world
would you value yourself
at such a number
that it is impossible --
that's what they've been trying
to figure out for 150 years.
[ laughter ]
Nobody would ever pay you
that valuation.
You're not worth
100 times your profit.
I think you're screwed.
I'm out.
And then there
was Barbara.
Barbara,
what are you gonna do?
I think you're screwed.
I'm out.
[ laughter ]
Oh, Barbara!
I'm sorry.
That was so --
guys, we didn't mean
to be that mean. I mean --
no, because the wrong
evaluation -- it's too
bad you did that.
yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I apologize for us --
the initial response.
I didn't expect it.
All of us here tried
it, except for Kevin.
What are you
apologizing for?
Because we try to be very
supportive entrepreneurs.
You guys --
how can you be
supportive of this? My God.
No, somebody asks you for
a crazy number, and you
want to be supportive?
You're en-- you're --
you're encouraging America
to come here and ask
for stupid valuations?
All I can tell you is the first
615 times I drank beer,
I thought
it tasted horrible, right?
Nothing to do with the taste.
The valuation was insane.
Yeah, but, Kevin, you're basing
on the value today. They're --
oh, really?
I want to pay --
and I -- and I promise you,
we really wanted a deal
because you guys have so much
to bring to the table.
But why do you -- why did you
price it that way?
But I promise you
that next year,
we will do a minimum
of $10 million in sales.
I hope you do, guys.
I really, really hope you do.
We hope you prove us wrong.
O'LEARY: But you guys
didn't finish the story.
It's 150 years old.
Mayans were drinking it.
They no longer exist.
[ laughter ]
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good luck, you two.
Well, they obviously
didn't get it.
Kevin, with all due respect,
you're like a broken record.
I'm right every time.
It's always -- it's --
you don't look at the
future. look where they
were going with it.
The future is the Mayans.
They're history.
[ laughter ]
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
are entrepreneurs
with a business profiting
from competitive thrill-seekers.
Greetings, sharks.
hallelujah. this is America.
do anything to make a buck.
I'm kind of confused
on why you guys
are painting this
as a -- as super-unethical --
O'LEARY: I am not --
I'm trying to figure out,
can I make a return in
the supplemental market
with your strategy?
But you haven't articulated one.
I'm out.
Thank you.
CUBAN: Look, if you had
come in here and said,
"I want to do
a controlled test.
"I so believe at this
that I want to be able
to demonstrate
that this works."
that's not what you
came in to do.
You -- you got a good marketing
pitch, you got big margins,
and so, you can --
you can just do it,
and that's what much of
the supplement business
is all about.
Not for me. I'm out.
Thank you.
Barbara?
What are your thoughts?
Um, I happen to have
a lot of close experience
with people
who can't hold attention.
One is my husband, bill,
who's a super-high-I.Q. Guy
and has been on Adderall
his entire life.
He orders anything
and everything
and tries everything out so
that he doesn't take Adderall.
And certain things work,
and then he's functional.
Another experience --
my kid went to a high-pressure
ivy league college,
and he tells me that kids
trade a-adderall
faster than beer.
It's the drug of choice,
so there is a real need
for kids to have something
to help them concentrate.
But here's the thing --
I'm concerned
about the liability.
If you would do
a contingent deal
where I have to get some kind
of liability coverage --
[ groaning ]
I don't need
your help here, Mark.
So if you'd be willing to
make a small contingency
on that deal --
so, Barbara, no matter
what chemical
or anything he puts in there
that may kill somebody...
no, I read the chemicals.
...As long as you're insured
if he kills somebody,
you're fine.
Let me tell you. Anything
wrongly taken can kill somebody.
Just insurance
if somebody dies.
You know what?
I'm gonna take a shot at it.
What is your offer?
My offer is $75,000
with that contingency for 40%.
Oh, Barbara. Barbara.
So, she has actually cut
your valuation in half --
offered you $75,000 --
no, he's not asking
for an interpreter,
thank you very much.
What do you think?
You're making me ill.
I'm very aware
of the valuation.
You're making me ill,
Barbara.
I can't believe you made
an offer on that.
You're making my ill,
Barbara.
I'm absolutely willing
to -- to do
the -- the liability
insurance.
And if you'd go down to 37%,
I'd be happy to take your deal.
[ groans ]
No. 40%.
40% -- you got a deal.
Let's do it.
CORCORAN:
You got it, baby.
They're making you out like
you're a thief in the night.
I thank you.
Appreciate it.
Yeah.
We'll do great.
He's not so bad.
You guys are welcome
to try it.
If I leave some,
would you --
would you be willing
to try it?
No.
No, they're
too close-minded.
All right, well, thanks, guys.
Appreciate it.
O'LEARY:
I did not see that coming.
You know I hate that.
Yeah, of course you hate it.
I don't care if you --
no, no.
you know why I hate it?
'cause I have a lot
of respect for you.
And by you investing in that,
you're giving credibility to it.
Listen, when my husband's taking
supplemental nutrients,
he functions better.
