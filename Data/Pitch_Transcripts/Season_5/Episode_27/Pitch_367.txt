I am Aaron Bruce.
My company is Angellift.
I'm here seeking
a half-million dollars
in exchange
for 10% of my company.
You know,
nobody wants to look old.
In fact,
women spend billions
injecting poisons, acids,
even animal parts
Aaron, you're not
married, obviously.
Well, I am.
This is my beautiful wife,
Kelly.
She's our best model.
Clearly, Angellift is
a game-changer in this industry.
Aaron, you have to wear them
for how long?
30 minutes a day --
30 to an hour a day for 30 days
would take out
about 87%.
So you have
to wear these forever?
No, you have to do
what we call maintenance wear.
So maybe once a week, you'll
wear them once the lines are out
because you'll need to
tell your body
that you still need
that space.
Aaron, what do you
sell it for?
So, when we tested it in
the market, we sold it for $49.
Did you mention yet whether you
have any proof that it works?
Real proof.
Absolutely.
Not only do we have third-party
clinical trials to prove it,
Wait.
Aaron, Aaron,
you've done a great job.
That's the one thing
that's very confusing to me.
Yeah,
I'm very confused.
Here's your pitch --
So, Aaron,
you want to stop sales
while you perfect
the product?
It's pretty close.
GREINER: But, Aaron,
that's an easy thing to do.
O'LEARY: But that -- Aaron,
that does not make sense.
I know it --
Y-you come in the Shark Tank
with a monster success
that's generating
over $1 million in free cash.
Why wouldn't you
just simply be upgrading --
Constantly upgrading
your site,
constantly upgrading
your package
while you bring in
the cash?
I want to maximize
the value of my company.
We have a product here
that will knock out injections
altogether.
Yeah, but, Aaron, look --
You're talking out of both sides
of your mouth...
[ laughs ]
...Because what you're
saying is,
"I'm taking back control
of my company."
Okay, that's fine.
That makes for
a good talking point.
But you said
you made $1.2 million.
Mm-hmm.
You're not hurting
for cash, right?
Aaron, i-in my world,
it's evil
if something's selling
Lori is Aaron's last chance
for a deal.
I think
it's a QVC product.
I think it's
an infomercial product.
But I have to admit
i-it's a very confusing story.
You said,
"It was doing great.
AARON: Well,
in my opinion, Lori,
this is a giant package in pink
wrapped up for you.
This is your area.
This is your arena.
You're the one
that really carries --
$500,000 for a 10% stake
doesn't do it for me.
I know the offers we've
already had for our company.
I know the kind of sales we do
in a tiny test market.
I know what we're gonna do.
It's huge numbers.
I'm gonna make you
a really hard bargain here.
AARON: Sure.
Ooh.
May not take it.
I want to see
proof of your patent,
proof of the $3 million
in retail that you've done,
CUBAN: You're just
really proving my point, Aaron,
that you're
a gold digger.
Oh, I am a gold digger.
I'm an entrepreneur.
GREINER: How's this?
If I gave you
the $500,000,
I get 15%, as you said,
but the $500,000
would solely be used
to fund any purchase orders
that came in from QVC.
15%.
15% for $500,000.
You fund the buy from QVC.
The $500,000 goes
into an account
that solely funds
your QVC purchase orders.
Aaron, what are you
gonna do?
Lori, I'll do the deal.
Good.
CUBAN: There you go.
There you go.
Thank you, sharks.
We'll help
straighten up faces.
[ both laugh ]
Thank you, Lori.
When you come back
for an update,
we'll see if I look
any better.
[ chuckles ]
GREINER:
Thank you. Good luck.
Thank you.
If he doesn't have the patent,
if he can't get on QVC,
if he doesn't have the trials,
it's all gone.
HERJAVEC:
Forget all that.
The guy's selling $3 million,
then pulls it?
There's more
to that story.
There's more
to that story.
Yeah, there is.
Next.
