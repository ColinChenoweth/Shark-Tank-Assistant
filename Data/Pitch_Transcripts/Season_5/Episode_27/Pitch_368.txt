Ryan, what
do you do now?
I'm a sophomore at S.M.U.
Thank you.
So you've had this product
in your closet for 10 years?
Yes, seven --
Yes, seven years.
Well, Ryan,
you said in grade 3,
which was
a long time ago...
Yes.
...You sold it
to a big retailer.
Who was that?
Walmart.
You got this
in Walmart?
All right, so, Ryan --
A hanger? a hanger?
$3.89 apiece?
A four-pack.
A four-pack for $3.89.
So, what do a pack
of regular plastic hangers cost
compared to
a pack of yours?
Like...88 cents.
[ chuckles ]
Did you file
for a patent?
Yes, I have
a fully issued utility patent.
So I have
a big question.
Mm-hmm.
I've seen other products
out there like this.
Really?
I've done research
on a bunch of hangers,
Ryan, who's your primary
competition?
I -- There's
really not anything
that does the pressure thing
out there.
There's nobody else
that you've seen that folds?
I guess the ma--
Right, the major competition
would be the normal
plastic hanger, but --
You've seen nobody
who folds.
I-I haven't.
I haven't. I've --
I've seen this.
I know I've seen it.
Okay.
Now, I'm not sure.
I just can't remember.
Mark said he's seen it.
Definitely in luggage,
I've seen it.
But what about it?
Well, so I'm asking.
I mean, what are we
missing here?
There's got to be
some competition somewhere
that's comparable.
Nothing?
You know what
you're missing here?
You're missing there's
no real problem to solve.
No, I don't believe that at all,
'cause I see --
Look, just being --
I don't mind a kid
with a messy closet.
You have two children,
correct?
Three. Yeah.
Three? It's -- Get their clothes
off the rack like that?
Forget my children.
Me -- Right?
No, literally, I yank. I yank.
Right.
I'm a yanker.
I-I see the value, right?
But it's just
inconceivable to me
that there's nothing else
like this that you've seen.
Or you just haven't
done the work.
It concerns me
that others are out there
really cornering
the market,
I think, using your idea.
