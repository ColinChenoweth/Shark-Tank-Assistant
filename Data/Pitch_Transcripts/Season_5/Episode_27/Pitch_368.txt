I am Aaron Bruce.
My company is Angellift.
I'm here seeking
a half-million dollars
in exchange
for 10% of my company.
You know,
nobody wants to look old.
In fact,
women spend billions
injecting poisons, acids,
even animal parts
into their face, and that's
just to try and remove wrinkles.
Laugh lines, smile lines,
frown lines, lip lines.
There's all kinds
of names for them.
They all make us look old.
I believe
that we have developed
one of the greatest anti-aging
tools of our generation.
And I'd like to introduce
to you now Angellift.
Angellift is the only
under-the-skin facial
lifting strips in the world.
Through the use
of light, soft pressure,
we can not only stop
this facial movement,
we can restore
facial contours.
We can lift out lines.
We can add volume
to lips.
Angellift is worn exactly like
teeth-whitening strips --
10 to 30 minutes a day,
then you put them away.
They're worn when you're
completely relaxed,
when it's comfortable
for you.
[ laughter ]
The most difficult thing about
wearing Angellift for women
is just to be quiet
for a few minutes.
CORCORAN: Ohh.
CUBAN: Wow.
HERJAVEC: Whoa!
O'LEARY: Clearly...
Do not make any comments.
...We can really use
Angellift up here.
Aaron, you're not
married, obviously.
Well, I am.
This is my beautiful wife,
Kelly.
She's our best model.
Clearly, Angellift is
a game-changer in this industry.
And in many, many cases,
Angellift has been a
life-changer for a lot of women.
I've come here to "Shark Tank"
to find a partner to help me
build an amazing brand.
Does this work
permanently?
This has a cumulative effect
on the skin.
Your mouth, unlike
any other part of your body,
reacts to pressure
and reacts very fast.
We've found out through
orthodontists on our team
that the same thing happens
with braces.
When you put braces on, which
lift two to four millimeters,
you instantly get
almost a facelift,
but months after
they're removed, with adults,
they see the wrinkles
begin to come back.
Really?
But the pressure causes
a cumulative action
within your mouth.
Kelly's gonna hand out
some -- some samples for you.
CUBAN: You guys are both
in your 70s, right?
[ laughter ]
KELLY: Right.
80s. But you're close.
Thanks.
O'LEARY:
Why is it only for women?
It's not. 30% of our --
Of our customers are men.
How much do they sell for,
and what are your total --
Total revenues?
Okay, so, we only sold these
in a test market, all right?
We took an unfinished product,
and we took it
to the smallest live shopping
channel in the country.
In that test market,
we did about $3 million retail.
We profited $1.2 million.
HERJAVEC: You did
$3 million in sales?
In a test. Correct.
Wow.
We pulled out of there,
but we are still filling orders
from shows that happened
over six months ago.
Aaron, you have to wear them
for how long?
30 minutes a day --
30 to an hour a day for 30 days
would take out
about 87%.
So you have
to wear these forever?
No, you have to do
what we call maintenance wear.
So maybe once a week, you'll
wear them once the lines are out
because you'll need to
tell your body
that you still need
that space.
Well, you have pictures here --
Before and afters.
Mm-hmm.
Same model.
These are not retouched.
No.
So how long
a period of time
from the "before"
to the "after" there?
These are 30 days.
30 days.
In 30 days, you had
that much improvement.
That much change.
Wow!
Is there anything
proprietary about it?
We are under patent pending
right now.
Aaron, what do you
sell it for?
So, when we tested it in
the market, we sold it for $49.
Did you mention yet whether you
have any proof that it works?
Real proof.
Absolutely.
Not only do we have third-party
clinical trials to prove it,
but we've gone to QVC,
and they took us to theirs.
So why are you
 not on QVC?
We haven't pursued QVC at all
because we want the public
to come to us --
To come to Angellift.
We don't want to
go to new buyers.
Wait.
Aaron, Aaron,
you've done a great job.
That's the one thing
that's very confusing to me.
Yeah,
I'm very confused.
Here's your pitch --
"We have too many sales and have
pulled the product back."
We don't -- I don't believe
the product's finished.
I want a finished line.
That's what I came here for.
So, Aaron,
you want to stop sales
while you perfect
the product?
It's pretty close.
GREINER: But, Aaron,
that's an easy thing to do.
O'LEARY: But that -- Aaron,
that does not make sense.
I know it --
Y-you come in the Shark Tank
with a monster success
that's generating
over $1 million in free cash.
Why wouldn't you
just simply be upgrading --
Constantly upgrading
your site,
constantly upgrading
your package
while you bring in
the cash?
I want to maximize
the value of my company.
We have a product here
that will knock out injections
altogether.
Yeah, but, Aaron, look --
You're talking out of both sides
of your mouth...
[ laughs ]
...Because what you're
saying is,
"I'm taking back control
of my company."
Okay, that's fine.
That makes for
a good talking point.
But you said
you made $1.2 million.
Mm-hmm.
You're not hurting
for cash, right?
Then you come in and say,
"I need $500,000.
I need your expertise."
[ imitates buzzer ]
HERJAVEC: The story
just doesn't add up for me.
To pull a product
that's selling $3 million
because it increases
the value of your business --
You got more guts than I do
'cause I would have --
I would have
kept selling more.
I don't understand
the need.
And if I don't see
the need...
My money doesn't go there.
I'm out.
I appreciate it, Robert.
Thank you.
I don't think you get it,
when you look at this packaging,
what it is.
I think you really
have to demonstrate it.
We --
So it's a very expensive sell
to demonstrate,
do an infomercial, do -- do QVC,
whatever you're gonna do,
but that's necessary.
I think it's gonna cost
way too much money
to make this happen,
so I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
Aaron, i-in my world,
it's evil
if something's selling
and you stop doing it.
I've never, ever,
ever heard anybody
say that here
in the Shark Tank.
Sheer evil.
And I don't want to be
part of it. I'm out.
How much cash does
the company have in the bank?
$1 million and change.
Yeah, I mean, look --
I wanted you to be
the first guy at "Shark Tank"
to just own it and say,
"I'm here because I'm gonna
sell a crap load more."
But you just didn't step up
and own it.
I don't trust that you're here
for the right reasons.
I'm out.
So, who's left?
Lori?
Lori's intrigued.
She sees the opportunity,
but she's looking
at the price tag,
saying,
"Wow, that's a lot."
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.
Lori is Aaron's last chance
for a deal.
I think
it's a QVC product.
I think it's
an infomercial product.
But I have to admit
i-it's a very confusing story.
You said,
"It was doing great.
"We were on a shopping channel,
and we pulled it.
"We went in to QVC.
They loved it,
but then we didn't pursue it."
'cause he's evil.
GREINER: I feel very iffy
about what you're doing.
I still don't really
understand it.
AARON: Well,
in my opinion, Lori,
this is a giant package in pink
wrapped up for you.
This is your area.
This is your arena.
You're the one
that really carries --
$500,000 for a 10% stake
doesn't do it for me.
I know the offers we've
already had for our company.
I know the kind of sales we do
in a tiny test market.
I know what we're gonna do.
It's huge numbers.
I'm gonna make you
a really hard bargain here.
AARON: Sure.
Ooh.
May not take it.
I want to see
proof of your patent,
proof of the $3 million
in retail that you've done,
and I'd like to see
your clinical trials
and see that
they are accurate.
Those are all easy.
I will offer you
the $500,000,
but I want...
25% of your company.
I respect your offer.
Everything we have going
right now
is so exciting and so big.
I was hoping that you
would jump on and enjoy the ride
and help us with the direction
of the brand,
as I would of any of the sharks,
but it's way too high for us.
Hmm.
Do you want to
counter to her?
I do.
I would offer you 15%.
What kind of greed
is this?
CUBAN: You're just
really proving my point, Aaron,
that you're
a gold digger.
Oh, I am a gold digger.
I'm an entrepreneur.
GREINER: How's this?
If I gave you
the $500,000,
I get 15%, as you said,
but the $500,000
would solely be used
to fund any purchase orders
that came in from QVC.
15%.
15% for $500,000.
You fund the buy from QVC.
The $500,000 goes
into an account
that solely funds
your QVC purchase orders.
Aaron, what are you
gonna do?
Lori, I'll do the deal.
Good.
CUBAN: There you go.
There you go.
Thank you, sharks.
We'll help
straighten up faces.
[ both laugh ]
Thank you, Lori.
When you come back
for an update,
we'll see if I look
any better.
[ chuckles ]
GREINER:
Thank you. Good luck.
Thank you.
If he doesn't have the patent,
if he can't get on QVC,
if he doesn't have the trials,
it's all gone.
HERJAVEC:
Forget all that.
The guy's selling $3 million,
then pulls it?
There's more
to that story.
There's more
to that story.
Yeah, there is.
Next.
NARRATOR: Just this season,
Brian and Julie Whiteman
struck a deal
with Kevin and Mark
for their photo-book service,
Groovebook.
The Groovebook app
allows you to choose
up to 100 photos every month
from your smartphone
and create a beautiful, bound,
photo book in just minutes.
Let's see what they're
up to now.
JULIE:
It's only been a week since we
appeared on "Shark Tank,"
and things have been
non-stop crazy.
BRIAN: We got 50,000
new customers in five days,
and the orders still
keep coming in by the minute.
Yeah?
How's it going today?
Good. Good.
Really busy.
JULIE: It took us one year
to get to 35,000 customers.
One night on "Shark Tank,"
we now have 85,000 customers.
That equates to $3 million
in sales.
But once they tell
their friends and their family,
who knows
what that may turn into?
It could double.
It could triple.
JULIE: Kevin!
Brian, Julie.
We're so excited
to have you here!
O'LEARY: I called
Brian and Julie, and I said,
"Brian, I want to come out
and see the operation."
I want to see
what I'm putting my money into.
Wow.
In all the "Shark Tank"
deals I've done,
I've never seen a tripling
of the user base
in a matter of five days --
None of us have.
This is where we put
the "groove" in the Groovebook.
O'LEARY:
The Groovebook story is proof
of the "Shark Tank" factor.
It's the most powerful
venture-capital firm on Earth.
It has sharks, it has money,
and it has millions
of people watching.
When you put all of those
together, magic happens.
JULIE: Each morning I've
woken up, I've pinched myself.
I just can't believe
this is really happening,
and I just can't wait to see
what happens in the future.
NARRATOR:
Next up is a 19-year-old
with a product he developed
when he was a third-grader.
Hi, sharks.
