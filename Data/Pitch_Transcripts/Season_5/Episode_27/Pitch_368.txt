I'm Ryan from Plano, Texas,
and my company is HangEase.
Today I'm seeking $80,000
in exchange for a 30% stake
in my company.
HangEase is
a collapsible clothing hanger
that'll do two things for you.
First, it'll make it easier
to get your clothes
off the rack.
And second, it'll make it easier
to hang your clothes.
This will save you
time and money
by getting rid
of broken plastic hangers
and stretched-out shirt necks.
HangEase was born out
of my third-grade project
called
the invention convention,
where I was told
to walk through my house,
find a problem, and solve it.
The problem I solved
was right in my own closet --
Broken plastic hangers
and stretched-out shirt necks.
This drives moms nuts.
My third-grade solution
looked like this.
The finished product
looks like this.
You see, the way HangEase works
is simple.
It's built around a hinge
in the center of the hanger
that collapses
when pressure's applied,
dropping the shirt off
into your hand.
It also makes it easier
to hang clothes.
You simply insert the hanger
into the shirt neck, pop it out,
and it's right back up
on the rack,
which I think
is perfect for men
'cause some guys never learn how
to hang their clothes properly.
I sold HangEase
to a major retailer,
but due
to the grueling schedule
of a third-grader,
I wasn't able to continue.
But now I'm here and ready
to bring HangEase back.
Sharks, I'm 19,
I'm out of high school,
so who's with me
to bring a third-grader's dream
back to life?
Let's get you some samples.
Ryan, what
do you do now?
I'm a sophomore at S.M.U.
Thank you.
So you've had this product
in your closet for 10 years?
Yes, seven --
Yes, seven years.
And just decided
to bring it out now?
Yes.
Did you dust
these things off?
Uh, we -- Yeah, we did.
I've had them in boxes.
I use them in my closet,
as well, though, so --
[ chuckles ]
You really had them in boxes
for seven years? Tell me.
I have. Yes.
Well, Ryan,
you said in grade 3,
which was
a long time ago...
Yes.
...You sold it
to a big retailer.
Who was that?
Walmart.
You got this
in Walmart?
And what -- What happened
with those sales?
Well, with Walmart,
we sold about --
It was four --
An order of 400,000 hangers.
So that's about --
400,000 hangers?!
400,000 hangers.
That's about --
[ laughs ] Yes.
How did you even
get in to Walmart?
Well, one of my, uh,
classmates' friends --
I think she was
a sales broker,
and she had
a relationship with them.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
One of your classmates'
friends --
One of my classmates' mothers.
Mothers -- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
So one of your third --
Oh, mothers, okay, there we go.
Oh. Whoa.
One of my classmates'
mothers, right --
Uh, she has a company
that has a relationship
with retailers,
and she had a relationship
with Walmart,
and she was walking through
the invention convention
and saw my product,
and she loved it.
Now, how much of it
did you sell in Walmart?
Their sale was for $200,000.
How much money
did you make?
I made $70,000 off of that.
If it was selling through them
and it was successful,
why wouldn't they
keep going with it?
My suspicion is that it wasn't
really marketed well.
GREINER: What did
one piece sell for?
Uh, they sold for
about $3.89.
All right, so, Ryan --
A hanger? a hanger?
$3.89 apiece?
A four-pack.
A four-pack for $3.89.
So, what do a pack
of regular plastic hangers cost
compared to
a pack of yours?
Like...88 cents.
[ chuckles ]
Did you file
for a patent?
Yes, I have
a fully issued utility patent.
So I have
a big question.
Mm-hmm.
I've seen other products
out there like this.
Really?
I've done research
on a bunch of hangers,
and I haven't
ever seen anything
that does
what my product does.
CORCORAN: You've seen no
foldable hangers at all?
Yeah, I have seen --
I've definitely seen --
N-nothing with
the pressure application.
CUBAN: I think what
Lori's saying, too --
When you buy a hanging bag,
for instance --
Mm-hmm.
Suitcase, hanging bag, right?
You get metal things.
Like, there's a little metal
thing that collapses so that
you can put it --
HERJAVEC: Oh, yeah.
You're right.
GREINER:
Great point, Mark.
Tell me again.
I'm a retailer.
What is the --
What is the benefit, again,
to me,
of using your hanger?
You're selling clothes?
Yeah.
The benefit of this, opposed to
using a normal hanger,
is when people come in
and they try and get
your clothes off to try them on
or they're messing with it
out there --
They just yank it.
It -- It can damage
your clothes.
I'm that guy, right?
[ chuckling ]
You are that guy.
I'm that guy.
Boom, there it is.
There's a sweater
or whatever.
Pull. That's it, right?
Right.
But why does a high-end retailer
care about
tearing clothes off his hangers?
Why would --
Because when idiots like me
pull it off,
they don't want it
to be damaged.
It's a common problem,
though.
No.
I mean, the reason why I've seen
this out there a lot
is because
it's a common problem.
HERJAVEC: Well, look,
I've learned one thing today.
I thought Mark Cuban
was a slob.
I've learned
he's a real slob.
[ chuckles ]
So I don't see the application
for the product.
Um...
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you so much
for your time.
I-I don't think you have
a chance of survival with this
'cause it's too expensive.
I personally do not see
the vision
of this opportunity
at all.
And it bores
the crap out of me.
Oh.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Here's my read on it.
I've invested in a few
businesses on "Shark Tank"
that were businesses put to
the side and then brought back.
On those few businesses,
I've never done well.
And I think because while
you're putting it to the side,
the passion goes with it,
and it's hard to really go back
and travel in time
and kick that product back in
with the same heart in it,
all right?
This is an old idea
that you stuffed in your closet.
You ought to leave it there
and move on.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you so much.
Who's left?
Mark...
And Lori.
...And Lori.
Ryan, who's your primary
competition?
I -- There's
really not anything
that does the pressure thing
out there.
There's nobody else
that you've seen that folds?
I guess the ma--
Right, the major competition
would be the normal
plastic hanger, but --
You've seen nobody
who folds.
I-I haven't.
I haven't. I've --
I've seen this.
I know I've seen it.
Okay.
Now, I'm not sure.
I just can't remember.
Mark said he's seen it.
Definitely in luggage,
I've seen it.
But what about it?
Well, so I'm asking.
I mean, what are we
missing here?
There's got to be
some competition somewhere
that's comparable.
Nothing?
You know what
you're missing here?
You're missing there's
no real problem to solve.
No, I don't believe that at all,
'cause I see --
Look, just being --
I don't mind a kid
with a messy closet.
You have two children,
correct?
Three. Yeah.
Three? It's -- Get their clothes
off the rack like that?
Forget my children.
Me -- Right?
No, literally, I yank. I yank.
Right.
I'm a yanker.
I-I see the value, right?
But it's just
inconceivable to me
that there's nothing else
like this that you've seen.
Or you just haven't
done the work.
It concerns me
that others are out there
really cornering
the market,
I think, using your idea.
And I'm not sure if they
infringe your patent or not.
That's the problem.
Right.
What are you gonna do?
So make a contingency deal
with the kid.
Come on.
CUBAN: Look,
I'll -- I'll make you a deal.
But, to everybody's point,
there is uncertainty relative
to the competition.
Okay.
There is uncertainty
to whether or not
your patent's
being violated.
So, contingent on the patent
being legit and covering
and that we do
have protection,
I'll offer you
the $80,000 for 30%,
just like you've asked.
I know Lori's kind of
thinking about this.
If Lori wants to come in
and split it, that's fine,
uh, because we -- just
two brains are better than one
in this particular case.
Lori?
I would do it with Mark.
I think you deserve a chance.
I-I'd love to do that.
Absolutely.
Done.
All right. Done.
Easy, breezy.
Wow, you could have asked
for a lot more.
Yeah, we could have,
but why?
Thank you, Mark.
I'll even throw in
some Mavs t-tickets
so you can come
to a game.
I'd love it.
[ laughs ]
I'm a huge fan.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
I just got to check.
I just got to check this.
Watch.
Yeah.
See, that's great.
Hang one up real fast.
It makes it easy.
That plays. Yeah.
It's great.
I'll just use them at home.
It's worth it.
$80,000 worth of hangers.
[ snaps fingers ]
Nothing.
[ laughs ]
Thank you all.
GREINER: Yeah.
I can't even tell you
how many times
I've pulled down on something
that's on a hanger
and then boomeranged it,
you know.
Right.
LANDIS: I'm feeling awesome.
I've worked really hard
on this product.
It's been a part of me
since third grade,
and I'm crazy excited that I got
a deal with Mark and Lori today
and we can do some great
business together in the future.
