John, the average guy
doesn't realize...
Whoa.
...It's his wife's birthday
until that morning.
I tell you, John, there's
one problem with your deal.
You are crazy expensive.
I think the risk in your deal
is not executional risk

It's exit risk.
You have to be acquired
by a strategic.
Good luck, John.
Thank you
for the flowers.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Kevin sending flowers
to my grave
was a really funny comment,
but he forgot
that we offer overnight shipping
from California,
so they can show up to my grave
right on time.
[ sighs ]
Brutal.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a unique way
to solve an age-old problem.
Hi, sharks.
