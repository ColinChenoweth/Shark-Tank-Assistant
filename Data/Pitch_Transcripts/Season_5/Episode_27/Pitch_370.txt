I'm John, and I'm so excited
to introduce to you today
the world's most genuine
online floral solution --
The Bouqs company.
I'm here seeking
an investment of $258,000
in exchange for 3%
of our business.
HERJAVEC:
[ laughs ]
Now, just by way
of introduction,
I'm a Pittsburgh-born guy
who knows how to make
a lot of money, Mr. Wonderful,
selling lovely flowers
to be sent to the
lovely people in our lives.
Lori and Barbara,
these are for you.
GREINER: [ laughs ]
Wow. Man after
my own heart.
CORCORAN:
What a schmoozer.
That's our desperado bouquet,
and this is
our diamonds bouquet.
You know how to suck up to me,
baby, and I love it.
O'LEARY: Are those
real, or are they fake?
GREINER: They're real.
They're beautiful.
Oh, wow.
They smell great.
CUBAN: Are they real?
CORCORAN: Yeah, they're real,
and they're fresh.
TABIS: So,
this business is working
because there are really major
consumer paying points
in this industry.
They say it's $19.99.
You check out at $64.50.
What's up with that?
Bait-and-switch product.
You see a photo.
It's not what arrives.
And this is flowers.
This is supposed to feel good.
There's a solution,
and the solution is Bouqs.
Bouqs are bouquets simplified.
Now, there's three things
that we do
to really make
our business special.
The first --
We have one price.
It's $40 --
$40 including shipping.
There are no "care and handling"
charges.
And we also don't try to sell
you a cheesy plastic butterfly
or some balloons that just
degrades the experience.
The second thing
we do differently
is we ship straight from
eco-friendly, sustainable farms
located on the equator
on the side of a volcano.
Seriously.
That's the volcano.
It also means
you get a really fresh stem,
because it comes
straight from the farm.
The third and final thing
we do differently
is our concierge service.
You can schedule an entire
year's worth of deliveries.
Birthdays, anniversaries,
important business dates --
We take care of it for you,
and we do it all at a discount.
Business is blooming.
Let's get you guys out of
the water and onto the volcano.
Who's with me as we build
the next big flower brand
at the Bouqs company?
Tell us about
the business.
The business is essentially
an e-commerce business.
We launched this business
about 11 months ago.
This year to date,
we've done $700,000 in sales
with almost no
marketing budget.
Wow. Good for you.
What are you attributing
your success to?
I think people were ready
for something that feels
a little different
in this space.
Is this a $40 bouquet,
this bouquet you just gifted me?
That's a $50 bouquet.
I thought you said
you had one price.
$50.
I thought you said
everything was $40.
Everything was $40.
So, our $40 price
is for all of our skus,
and you can double that sku
for $10 more,
and you can triple it
for $10 more than that.
When you say
double the sku --
When you say "double," you mean
double the amount of flowers?
Exactly.
So, if mine is --
That's the most
exciting angle,
and you didn't
even mention that.
It really is.
That's a great angle.
Let -- Let's go back
for a second before we
dive into the numbers.
How did you even
start the business?
TABIS: We started the company,
actually, with my co-founder.
His name's J.P. Montúfar.
He's actually on the volcano,
which is why he couldn't
be here today.
And he's the sort of
floral-farming expert,
and I'm more of the front-end
operations, marketing,
brand side of things.
GREINER: And explain
to us the volcano.
I-I don't know a lot about where
different flowers come from.
At the bottom
of this volcano,
are there a lot of very
prolific floral farms?
Absolutely.
What is your cost
of customer acquisition?
Our average, year-to-date,
is $13.
Yeah?
Last month was 20 bucks.
Wow.
Just give us what data
went into that number.
So, it's a combination
of some really amazing P.R.,
Oprah magazine, dailycandy,
thrillist, Wall Street journal.
How much money have you
spent just on P.R.?
No, not P.R. --
Marketing, advertising.
Total marketing to date
has been...about $70,000.
What does the $40 bouquet
cost you?
We're at 40% to 50% gross
margins on the smallest size.
When we get up
to the triple bouquets,
we're closer to
the 50% end of that range.
Do you ship overnight?
I order today,
it's my husband's birthday
tomorrow.
Do I get them
tomorrow?
We do not.
It is six days
to delivery...
Whoa!
Ooh.
HERJAVEC: Six days?
...From your first
order -- paid order.
Oh, I think you just ran
into a buzzsaw.
John, the average guy
doesn't realize...
Whoa.
...It's his wife's birthday
until that morning.
I understand it. This is --
CORCORAN: [ laughs ]
until she tells him.
How is he gonna
wait six days?
So, two answers
to this question.
One is overnight shipping
launches in three weeks.
We're doing the same exact model
with California farms...
Oh, okay.
...To satisfy
the shorter lead time.
What will the price be
with overnight shipping?
Same prices,
same margins?
$10 more on everything,
slightly lower margins.
Ah.
But aren't you --
So, you're totally changing
your model already.
Um, I don't know
that we're changing it.
It's still farm-fresh,
farm-direct...
You upped the price.
You got --
You have it from California, and
it's going to be $50, actually.
Yes.
Some of our roses will last
in your home three weeks.
Why is that?
And people tweet about that,
people talk about it.
What do you attribute
that to?
So, my co-founder J.P.'s
background in biology
has come in very handy.
We actually have
a proprietary process
that we use
to hydrate the flowers.
And then the other thing is
you're getting these flowers
four or five days
after they were cut.
Whenever you're
at a local florist,
they're,
just by definition,
because it takes so long
for them to get there,
and then they have
to hold that inventory,
just much older flowers.
O'LEARY:
Let's go back to the numbers,
because no one's tackled
what really matters here --
Your evaluation.
My math, I think, is correct at
$8.6 million you're asking for?
That's right.
Okay, so,
let's be pragmatic.
You're going to do $800,000
in this calendar year, right?
We're gonna do
$1.2 million.
And you're going to make
on that about $250,000 pre-tax?
Yes.
Okay.
So, how do I value
your business?
Give me the metrics that
makes you worth $8.6 million.
Sure.
So, the growth
has been astronomical.
We started the business
10 months ago,
and we started
with $13,000
in our total, sort of,
friends-and-family round,
which was
literally, like,
my parents and my sisters
and my best friends.
And we grew that
into $700,000 in sales.
You said you raised $13,000,
friends and family.
Have you raised any money
since then?
We closed a seed round
in may of $1.1 million.
At what valuation?
That was
a $5.2 post money.
To me, that --
That's a huge problem.
I don't like to be
just one of many.
I don't like
to be dumb money.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
HERJAVEC: You just
raised the $1.1 million.
Why are you here
looking for $258,000?
We're actually raising
a full round of $1 million.
O'LEARY: So, you -- You have
an existing round that's open,
and the investors are willing to
pay a 40-times free cash flow.
I'm a very pragmatic
investor.
I don't care
what you're selling.
What matters in business
is cash flow.
That's it.
You're asking me
to pay 40 times,
which would be
the absolute premium
that I would pay
for a much larger company.
But he's growing.
Yeah, b-but it's
a flower business.
GREINER: Your angle -- The thing
that I saw is different...
What's his angle?
Tell me that.
...Was that it's
$40 a bouquet.
That's it. No added charges.
No shipping and handling.
And you can upgrade
for $10 to a $50 bouquet.
My problem is
all your competition
can do exactly what you said
if they like the idea
and the strategy,
so, for me, I think that this
doesn't have an edge anymore
over any other
floral company.
I'm out.
All right, look,
$258,000 for 3%,
I mean, that -- it's such
a small, irrelevant amount
to what
you've already raised.
I-I have a challenge
with that,
and I don't know
if your competitive
advantage
is sustainable.
I'm out.
CORCORAN: I want to address
the name of your business.
I think it's
a terrible name.
It's hard to spell,
hard to remember.
If you gave me
a spelling test,
it would take me 10 times
to really get it.
I'm out.
As usual, all roads
back to Mr. Wonderful.
I tell you, John, there's
one problem with your deal.
You are crazy expensive.
I think the risk in your deal
is not executional risk
'cause it sounds like
you know what you're doing.
It's exit risk.
You have to be acquired
by a strategic.
Very true.
You're in
the Neverland.
You're in a place
where it's not that attractive,
and you didn't really
differentiate yourself
against the commodity
other than to tell me
you're a better marketer.
That may be true,
but I think you may die
of old age waiting to exit.
But there's
another problem.
If I want to send flowers
to your grave,
I have to wait
six days...
[ laughter ]
...And I think --
And I think
you died here today.
I'm out.
Well, I very much appreciate
all of your time
and -- and your input,
and thank you so much
for having me.
Good luck, John.
Thank you
for the flowers.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Kevin sending flowers
to my grave
was a really funny comment,
but he forgot
that we offer overnight shipping
from California,
so they can show up to my grave
right on time.
[ sighs ]
Brutal.
NARRATOR: Next into the tank
is a unique way
to solve an age-old problem.
Hi, sharks.
