DOUBILET: Don't let
the party hats fool you.
We're savvy
businesswomen.
I could put one match
to the bottom of that.
It would burn beautifully.
You're a gold digger.
I've never heard anybody say
that here in the Shark Tank.
Sheer evil.
NARRATOR:
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first internet
companies for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
is an entrepreneur
who believes he has a better way
to send a thoughtful gift.
Hello, sharks.
I'm Emily Doubilet.
I'm Jessica Holsey.
We're friends living
in Brooklyn, New York.
I've always been
an environmentalist
who loves
to throw parties.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
These days, we're living
so much of our lives
behind a computer screen,
but having a party
or an event
makes people come out and
meet each other face-to-face.
We just got picked up
in the Southwest region.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Our company is unique
because we're building a
culture that's a little
weird but a lot of fun.
Bring it in.
We take time out for
a dance break during work,
or even a yoga break
to keep us energized.
Yes!
Purchase order.
Our company is growing
like crazy.
We really need
a capital infusion
to get this party
started.
We've put in
our personal savings,
left stable, paying jobs,
woken up with
panic attacks at night.
We're losing money
quickly,
but there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.
We're so close
to profitability,
and the sharks
can help us get there.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Hi. I'm
Jessica Holsey.
And I'm
Emily Doubilet.
We live in Brooklyn,
New York, and...
TOGETHER:
We're the owners of Susty Party!
We're seeking $250,000
in exchange for 10% of our
party-tableware company.
Parties and events produce
a huge amount of waste.
As an environmental-studies
grad from Oberlin college,
and as an entertainer
at heart,
I've always believed
in order to change the world,
throw a better party.
When I ran into Emily
at -- where else -- a party,
I was looking to leave
my Wall Street job
and put my Harvard
economics degree to use
building a business
that was good for people,
the planet, and profit --
The triple bottom line.
So, Susty -- Short for
"sustainable" -- Party was born.
We've created
a retail line
of eco-friendly,
highly functional,
mix-and-match party tableware,
all made in the U.S.a.
With factories who employ and
empower the visually impaired.
Our products are not
just plain brown or white
like other natural tableware,
but colorful and fun.
The cups, straws,
and cutlery
are made from sustainably
harvested wood,
and the napkins are made
from 100% recycled paper.
Our plates and bowls
are made from tapioca starch
and grass fiber,
but they're super sturdy,
even oven- and microwave-safe.
So, sharks, we're gonna
throw a little party,
right here, right now.
Get up, 'cause
we're gonna party...
Uh-oh.
Susty style!
...Susty style!
[ laughs ]
[ dance music plays ]
O'LEARY: Ahh.
All right!
We have special crowns
for you guys.
Here you are.
CORCORAN: Why not?
We have a special one
for you, Mr. Wonderful.
Is that right?
Why, thank you very much.
Whoo!
I like that.
Ah! That's perfect.
DOUBILET: Can get a little
dance circle going?
Is it a cupcake?
CORCORAN: Mark, you're
the best dancer here.
Come on,
you're so cool dancing.
All right, kiddies.
Come on.
[ both chanting
"Go, Barbara" ]
[ both chanting "Go, Lori" ]
GREINER:
Okay. I'm getting Robert.
HERJAVEC: No, I'm okay,
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Cake supplies.
All right.
That's it?
That was fast.
Cheers. Cheers.
Barbara, here's some
champagne for you.
Oh, thank you.
I earned that.
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
And we have...
Can I only buy these
from you, or can I buy
from other people?
We contract
a manufacturer.
CORCORAN:
I'm sorry, does that mean
that someone else can order
the same plates
from that particular factory
if they wanted?
We have sales-channel
distribution, like --
Yes. the answer
is yes, right?
CUBAN: So, you're a branding
play, basically.
DOUBILET: Right.
O'LEARY: You want to build
a brand around --
You want to build
a sustainability brand.
Brand design,
and, you know,
we are bringing
a few new products
that are gonna be
the first on the market.
What do your plates cost
for the same amount of plates
that aren't
environmentally conscious?
Our seven-inch plates retail
for about $4.99
for the pack of eight.
A thin paper plate might
be half that price,
but it's not competing.
Our plates are very sturdy,
so we would compare them to,
like, a thick plastic plate.
CUBAN: So, where are you
selling? how's it selling?
Give us the metrics.
We're carried by the largest
natural-products retailer
in the country,
Whole Foods.
So far, this year, we've done
$1 million in sales.
You've got
to be kidding.
That's fantastic!
We're on track
to do $1.5 million
by the end of this year,
which is triple
what we did last year.
CORCORAN:
Good for you. Wow.
Wow. Wasn't expecting
that answer.
I'm taking you
way more seriously now.
Don't let the party hats
fool you.
We're savvy
businesswomen.
[ laughs ]
We've been profitable
for the last three months.
We know we can grow.
From $1.5 million this year,
if we get an investment,
we can expand our sales channels
and expand our product lines
and do $5 million
next year.
So, this year,
with all the slotting fees,
launching nationally, we're
gonna net about an $80,000 loss.
How much cash do you have
in the bank?
We have about $30,000
in the bank right now.
Ooh.
That's a problem.
Ooh.
[ laughs ]
Jessica, how much in inventory
to do have today?
Right now, we have about
$125,000 in inventory.
That's a lot of money
in inventory.
GREINER:
the big interest to me --
You got to move
that inventory, Jessica.
So, you're at negative
current assets.
But we are, however,
on that $5 million that we think
we can get to next year,
we -- we would net
a $600,000 profit.
Jessica, where are you getting
the cash to fund the loss?
We do have some debt that
we've gotten from some angels.
How much?
It's about $200,000 --
A little over $200,000.
I don't want to poop
on the party here,
but you're asking me
for $250,000 for 10%.
You're putting an imputed value
of $2 1/2 million on it.
Do you think, if I wanted
to enter this business in
an identical way...
[ chuckles ]
...That I -- That I could --
CORCORAN: Oh, I can so see you
in this business, Kevin.
There's only happy people
allowed in your business.
Do you think I could do
what you've done
for a lot less
than $2 1/2 million?
No, absolutely not.
We have a few reasons
for you.
No way.
So, one,
we're authentic.
As you can see, we live
and breathe our mission.
What does that mean?
I'm authentic, too.
You're authentic?
Very.
We're responsive. We know
exactly what our customers want.
I'm more responsive.
We listen
to our customers.
[ chuckles ]
My point is, anybody
can do what you're doing.
Would they work as hard as we do
for as little pay as we do?
Would they spend years
researching the market
to know every sustainable
factory and scientist out there?
Maybe, but that's
the problem with your deal.
Would they know exactly what
the Susty Party customers want?
But it's -- It's a huge problem
with your deal.
You've met your match.
You've met your match.
Will they show up
at every sales meeting
with a boom box and a glass
of champagne in hand...
Yes, they will!
...Ready to bring
the party,
all while making
our dream a reality?
Good for you. My God.
I love this kid.
More innovation and competitors
are gonna drive us --
Our industry to have more
sustainable materials out there,
and we're gonna be one step
ahead of the competition.
You're selling paper plates,
and you're telling me you're
worth 2 1/2 million bucks?
It's not paper.
Are you nuts?
It's not paper.
It's tapioca.
It's not paper.
I could put one match
to the bottom of that.
It would burn beautifully.
Putting Kevin aside
for a sec --
And he is bringing up
a legitimate point --
Why is the business worth
$2 1/2 million?
We're gonna do $1.5 million
in sales this year.
On which you're gonna
lose $80,000.
But we really do think
we can make that $5 million.
And why would we believe
that you could actually build
the business
from where it is now
to $5 million
one year from today?
So, we're introducing
38 new product skus.
Without purchase orders?
Uh, yeah, we're --
We're kind of coming up
with a plan for that.
You love to talk,
and you're delicious
to listen to, no doubt.
I could spend a whole day
and enjoy every minute.
But I just don't think
I'm ever going to make
my money back on this.
I'm out.
Emily, the designs
are fantastic,
but...you got to run
like heck.
You got to get market share
above the $5 million level,
and hopefully,
somebody acquires you.
Or you then scale back
and then start making a profit.
I see a tremendous
amount of risk
in the business
at this point.
I'm out.
You know, you guys
are a great team.
I personally like
environmentally
conscious products,
and I like that it's made
in the U.S.a.
That's great.
More jobs for Americans.
I would love
to have invested in you,
but I just recently invested
in a company that makes
gift bags and tissue
and things like that,
and I think they're going to be
getting into plates that
are environmentally conscious,
so, for that reason,
I'm out.
The problem with your deal --
And I think the other sharks
are starting
to circle these waters --
This is a total commodity
that you're basically curating.
Frisky over here is very good
at picking the right colors
to put on the commodity.
GREINER:
"Frisky" is a positive.
I'll -- I'll take it.
So, leaving aside
your valuation issue,
the risk is
that someone else does this
that already has a much bigger
distribution channel
and a bigger
marketing budget
and crushes you like
the frisky cockroaches you are
in this space right now.
Everything you're doing
anybody else can get,
which is why I believe your
investors have only put debt in,
not equity.
We strategically
took debt
because we didn't want to give
up ownership of our company.
What interest rate
are you paying on your debt?
Some of them are as low as 4%,
and some are as high as 10%.
I sense that there's a difficult
situation coming, here.
Just -- I'm
a balance-sheet guy.
I'm looking at what's happening.
You're growing. You need cash.
Here's an offer for you.
NARRATOR: Three sharks are out,
but Kevin seems interested.
Here's an offer for you.
I'll lend you $250,000
as debt at 10%,
which is what
you're paying somebody else,
and I want...
30% of the company.
Plus the debt?
Plus the debt.
CUBAN:
[ laughs ]
[ groans ]
Bam!
We're --
Well, it's the only offer
you've got.
Boom goes the dynamite.
It's the only offer
you have.
So, Emily,
three sharks are out.
You have Mark left,
and Kevin's made you an offer.
Yeah, guys, I'm concerned
about your management.
Operational efficiency
is everything for you guys
when you're
cash-constrained.
You have $125,000
in inventory,
and what raises
a management red flag --
While you still have
this huge amount of inventory,
you're introducing
more skus.
We've come this far with
only $300,000 in capital. um --
No, no, no. don't -- don't
give me the sob story...
I'm not gonna give you
a sob story.
...Because it's not about
how much you've raised,
and it's not
about your sales.
Right.
It's about how effectively
you've managed your cash...
Right.
...How effectively have
you managed your inventory.
Right.
Look, I like the business,
but, operationally,
cash-management-wise,
there's, you know,
a truck on the other side
of the tunnel,
coming straight at you.
The minute one of these --
You -- retailers says,
"You need to start
generating demand,"
or a competitor
comes in the market,
you're stuck,
and that's a red flag for me,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
Hey, there.
Hi.
All roads lead
back to Mr. Wonderful.
To Mr. Wonderful.
[ laughs ]
What are you gonna do?
You know, I am the only shark
that actually graduated with
an environmental-studies degree.
Had you done your research,
you would have learned that.
I am an eco-preneur
for profit,
so I think profit
saves the world.
You're talking to
the only person here who cares.
[ laughs ]
I don't think it's
a good deal.
I think
we can do better.
So make a counter.
Well, what -- You know,
what if you did $250,000 in debt
and an option
for $250,000 at a discount
when we do
go out and raise money,
which, inevitably,
we have to do?
No.
I'm very good
at helping entrepreneurs,
but I see no reason
to be flexible here.
You are about to hit
a brick wall.
You both know it.
Well...
A little more champagne
while you're thinking about it?
You got to come
to a conclusion.
Right.
We think
that we can go out
and find an investor
who will support us.
All right, ladies.
The party's over.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Go get 'em.
Good luck.
Bye.
Eh. Blah.
DOUBILET: We turned
down Kevin's offer
because we're not willing
to give up so much equity
at such an early stage.
We're just gonna keep
living by our motto --
Respect Earth
and party on.
