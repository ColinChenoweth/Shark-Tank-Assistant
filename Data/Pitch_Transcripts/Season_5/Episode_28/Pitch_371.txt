Hello, sharks.
I'm Anton.
WILLIS: So, a few years ago,
I set out to design a kayak
that I could literally store
inside my bedroom closet.
WILLIS: Pretty strong, yeah.
We'll show you --
Pretty strong
or as strong?
As strong.
There you go.
Get out of my way.
GUTIERREZ:
Can we splash him?
You got to adjust the footrest
inside there.
You can,
just like a regular kayak.
Yeah.
I-I-I got to tell you,
it feels very, very solid.
WILLIS: It's pretty comfortable.
Yeah.
I was expecting it
to feel flimsy.
Yeah.
Not in the least.
Yeah, you'd have bought
a hundred of these
if they made you look cool,
Robert.
How many have you sold?
We sold 1,228.
Good for you.
At what price?
$1,100.
So your total sales
are at what?
$1.1 million.
Good for you.
WILLIS: There are a few,
but they're very expensive --
Usually $4,000 or $5,000.
They're much heavier,
WILLIS:
We're pretty excited.
It feels like great validation
to just have Robert love
the product so much
