Hello, sharks.
I'm Anton.
I'm Roberto.
And I'm ardy.
Our company is Oru Kayak,
and we're here seeking $500,000
for a 12% equity stake.
We all love kayaking,
but we hate all the hassle
of storing and transporting
our boats.
So what if I told you
that that kayak
folds out of this?
Wow.
WILLIS: So, a few years ago,
I set out to design a kayak
that I could literally store
inside my bedroom closet.
And to do that, I looked back
to an old childhood passion
Of mine -- Origami.
Wow!
JOHN: Oh.
That's pretty clever,
pretty clever.
So as you can see, the whole
boat unfolds pretty magically
out of a single, seamless sheet,
just like a piece of paper.
Now, this material
is extremely durable,
it's very sturdy,
and it's extremely light.
The whole boat weighs
only 26 pounds.
So as you can see, they're
inserting these rigid bulkheads,
which give the kayak
more structure.
This orange piece here,
which was the lid of the case
when I walked in,
now becomes the floorboard
of the kayak that you sit on.
Well done.
They're sealing up
the top seams.
These are the only seams
in the entire boat.
They're completely watertight,
so you're gonna stay dry,
even in rough water.
So that's a little bit
about how the kayak works.
I'm gonna hand it to Roberto
to talk about what you can do
with it.
Now, sharks, I'm a former
professional paddler,
and I've tested this
on flat lakes, big ocean waves,
and even
in Whitewater rapids.
The Oru Kayak is fast
and durable,
great for an expert-level
paddler like myself,
but it's stable,
comfortable, easy to use,
which is perfect
for beginners.
I told you a bit
about the boat.
Ardy's gonna tell you some more
about the company.
In nine months,
we launched the company,
created a manufacturing line,
and are shipping
all around the world.
Now we need a partner
to help us
scale up manufacturing
to meet the demand.
So...Who wants to jump
in the water with us?
WILLIS: Pretty strong, yeah.
We'll show you --
Pretty strong
or as strong?
As strong.
There you go.
Get out of my way.
GUTIERREZ:
Can we splash him?
You got to adjust the footrest
inside there.
You can,
just like a regular kayak.
Yeah.
I-I-I got to tell you,
it feels very, very solid.
WILLIS: It's pretty comfortable.
Yeah.
I was expecting it
to feel flimsy.
Yeah.
Not in the least.
Yeah, you'd have bought
a hundred of these
if they made you look cool,
Robert.
How many have you sold?
We sold 1,228.
Good for you.
At what price?
$1,100.
So your total sales
are at what?
$1.1 million.
Good for you.
And how have you sold them?
To who and how?
We sell primarily direct online
right now at our website,
and it's going direct
to consumer.
What does a typical kayak
sell for?
For a boat comparable in length,
size, and dimensions,
our best-selling boat
in this same range
sells for about $1,049.
So it's roughly
the same price as --
About the same
as that, yeah, so...
Is there any other collapsible
boat out there?
WILLIS: There are a few,
but they're very expensive --
Usually $4,000 or $5,000.
They're much heavier,
and they're much harder
to put together.
What's it cost you
to build one?
Right now,
it costs us $505.
Wow. That's a lot.
It is a lot, and that's why
we're looking for your money.
And what do you think is
the lowest you can get it at?
We think we can get it to $350
within the next year.
Right now it's
quite labor-intensive.
We're looking to replace
some of those labor-intensive,
handmade parts
through automation, equipment,
and assembly optimization
to just get them out
much faster, as well as cheaper.
HERJAVEC: I'm -- I'm a big
car guy. I-I love design.
What I find in the car world
is if you're unique
And -- And more beautiful,
there's a price point.
Right.
I-I'm struggling
with why aren't people
willing to pay more for it?
'cause it's beautiful.
We get both questions --
Why doesn't
this cost $500,
and why doesn't
this cost $1,500?
So what we were trying to do
is appeal
to the general population,
as well.
What's your projection
for next year?
Projection for next year
is, uh, $4 million in revenue.
You're gonna go from $1 million
to $4 million?
$1.1 million
to $4 million?
Well, we're gonna hit --
By end of the year, we're
gonna hit $1.4 million.
Guys, I-I'll get things going.
Beautiful, beautiful.
I'm not
a big outdoors guy,
and I've never been
in a kayak in my life,
so it's not really
a great fit.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
GUTIERREZ: Okay.
Thank you.
The -- The big issue
with this deal is
I don't think 500k is enough
to automate
the manufacturing process.
Some of the equipment you need
is very expensive.
It's -- It's an interesting
product, but to me,
I-it's not developed enough
on a manufacturing and
logistics point of view
to know how this thing scales
and how fast it can scale.
For that reason, I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your time.
I'm challenged with this,
'cause I love it,
and I want to give you
the money.
I just -- The unknown
is the manufacturing.
See, in my business, we're
really on tight margins.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
So if we can save 25 cents
on a pair of jeans,
we'll fly around the world
to do that, right?
Right. Right, right.
Right. Right.
So it's a touch too early,
and I can't help you with this.
And I'm -- I'm kicking myself,
but I'm out.
I'm not trying to push it,
but I would say I think
we've done a pretty amazing job
of getting this up -- the
manufacturing off the ground
from scratch, you know,
from a prototype.
Dealing with it
at a $1 million business
and dealing with it
at a $20 million business...
Of course. Mm-hmm.
...is night and day.
You know, I own two kayaks
that I never use. I mean...
[ laughter ]
But for some reason,
I'm dying to have this kayak.
I think it's like
a status symbol.
I really want to show off
about it.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah.
CORCORAN: And I think
that's half the sale.
It really is.
It's sexy and cool.
Yeah.
But here's the rub -- I love to
get involved with my businesses
and help them
however I can...
WILLIS: Mm-hmm.
...Other than investing
the money.
I can't imagine what I could do
With -- With this. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you very much,
yeah.
Robert?
And the only
adventure-loving guy here.
Ah.
[ laughs ]
Adventure-
and design-loving guy.
Definitely a customer.
Lot of risk
on the manufacturing side.
I think Daymond's right.
But I think you have a lot of
unanswered questions out there.
But, I got to tell you,
I-I made an investment
in a product that I just thought
was really cool --
Chordbuddy --
And we did great on it.
So sometimes I invest because,
you know, I'm a shark...
Mm-hmm.
...And I want my money back,
And it's "grrr!"
mm-hmm.
And sometimes I just think
it's really cool.
Yeah.
Right.
But I'm still a shark.
GUTIERREZ: Right.
Right.
$500,000 for 25%.
That's cutting
your valuation in half.
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.
Oru kayak has an offer
on the table from Robert.
$500,000 for 25%.
That's cutting
your valuation in half.
25%. All right.
So, Robert, we really love
your enthusiasm,
and we've always wanted
to have people involved
who really understand
the design behind this
on the brand value that we've --
We've -- We've created.
What do you think about 15%,
a-a seat on the board,
and we can do due diligence,
get you out to the factory?
Of course I'm going to get
a seat on the board, number one.
GUTIERREZ: Right.
Of course we're gonna go see
the factory,
and of course I'm gonna bring in
people that I trust,
that manufacture other things,
to help you guys.
Mm-hmm.
I-I'm not sure any
Of that stuff changes it. I-I --
So are you holding f-firm
at 25%,
or do you have room to move?
That's my offer. I-I'm not
interested in a counter at 15%.
Okay.
What are you gonna do?
All right.
So, Robert, would you take 20%?
[ laughs ]
No.
I-I -- You know, guys,
if it's worth --
If it's worth it to you
at 20%,
it's worth it to you at 25%.
$500,000 is a lot of money.
JOHN: Yeah.
That -- That's my offer.
I'm not trying to, you know,
negotiate you out of it.
I know.
That's the offer I feel
comfortable with.
Let's do it.
All right.
Well...
...we'd love to have you.
O'LEARY: Oh!
All right! Wow!
All right!
Excellent!
CUBAN:
Score one for the Robert.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah! Nice job.
Thank you. Thank you
very much. thank you.
Good job, guys. Well done.
Thank you.
CUBAN: Great product.
Great product.
Well presented.
Thank you.
Good job, Robert.
WILLIS:
We're pretty excited.
It feels like great validation
to just have Robert love
the product so much
and really have that
be the guiding force
behind his decision.
NARRATOR: In season 4,
Sabin lomac and Jim Tselikis
made a deal with Barbara
for their food-truck business,
Cousins Maine Lobster.
$55,000 for 15%.
Barbara,
welcome to the family.
Thank you.
Come on over here.
Come bring it here.
NARRATOR: Let's see
what they're up to now.
When we first came
on "Shark Tank,"
we had $150,000 in sales.
On our last update,
we had $700,000.
And now,
just a year later,
we're approaching
$3.5 million in sales.
What's cooking?
30 new applicants in Seattle.
When we started out,
it was our goal
to be the name and the face
of Maine lobster.
Right now we're taking
that step
with franchising
our trucks nationwide.
We are here today to deliver
our first truck
to our first
franchisee, Gil.
He loved our concept
and brand
and plans on taking the truck
to Phoenix, Arizona.
We have
a little surprise, too.
I'm excited. What?
[ horn honking ]
Look at this.
Hey, guys!
Barbara has always believed
that franchising our business
is the way
that we're gonna make it.
Wow.
Welcome aboard.
Running
a successful business
isn't just about keeping
all your profits and money.
It's about giving back.
So we created
our own foundation,
called Cousins for a Cause.
Welcome to Big Brothers
Big Sisters.
LOMAC: We chose Big Brothers
Big Sisters
to share
our profits with
because of
the personal connection
that I have
with their organization.
I was a little brother
growing up,
so the foundation means
a lot to me.
It was such a huge part
of my life growing up,
and now I have a little brother
named Lawrence.
LOMAC: What kind of theorem
is that?
Pythagorean theorem.
Phew! Boom!
Now I get to hopefully send him
in the right direction,
just like my Big Brother
did for me.
Whoo!
CORCORAN: These guys are
tomorrow's billionaires.
And more important than that,
they're gonna be
happy billionaires
because they know
how to give back.
What we have here
are two great entrepreneurs
that are giving back
and making a ton of money.
I mean, this is
the American dream.
Here we come, Phoenix.
We are so lucky to have made
a deal with Barbara.
Bottom line is,
she cares.
She's a part of our family,
and now we're a part of hers.
