My name is Jayla Siciliano.
I'm from Solana Beach,
California,
and I'm the owner
of Bon Affair.
California is the perfect place
to start my business,
'cause it's the hub
of America's wine country,
and it's also the hub
of health and fitness,
which are two key aspects
to my product.
Cheers.
Cheers.
My past career involved
a lot of business trips
where there was a lot
of wining and dining,
and I needed something that
wouldn't pack on the calories
and wouldn't leave me feeling
groggy the next morning.
We have the sauvignon blanc
and the syrah.
Currently, my business
is a grind.
I'm doing everything
from store deliveries
to managing the website,
and it's really tough
to compete
with the big alcohol companies
out there.
We have the capacity to do
up to 10,000 cases
a month for you.
I've pretty much risked
everything
to start this business.
I quit my job,
I cashed in my 401(k),
ran up credit cards, and I even
went back to bartending nights
so I could work during the day.
If I don't get a deal
from the sharks,
I honestly don't know
what's gonna happen.
We're running out of money,
and we're looking
at possibly having
to close the doors
in a few months
if I don't get this investment,
so I have everything
on the line right now.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Jayla Siciliano,
and I'm the founder
of Bon Affair.
I'm looking for $150,000
for 35% of my company.
Okay, now, I'm gonna guess
that most of you sharks
like to drink wine
and also care about your health.
I'm one
of over 50 million Americans
who feels the same way,
and in my past career,
there were tons of dinners
and parties.
And I love to have fun,
but I couldn't afford to wake up
feeling groggy in the morning,
so I started adding soda water
to my wine.
But I found I could
socialize longer
and I would feel better
the next morning,
and that's when it hit me.
HERJAVEC: Jayla,
if I ordered
a normal glass
of red wine,
your product,
how many calories?
So, this has half the calories
of regular wine.
What is the purpose of the
electrolytes that you mentioned?
You know, we make no claims.
It's alcohol.
It's not wheatgrass.
So we always say
the electrolytes are in there
'cause why not?
[ laughs ]
And from personal experience,
I find that they do help,
but interesting enough --
But help with what? I'm not sure
I understand the concept.
Um, countering the negative
effects of alcohol.
Less of a hangover.
Yeah.
Griffith University
in Australia
actually just did a study
at their health institute
on how electrolytes
added to beer
actually do hydrate you
more than regular beer.
Have you drank enough to really
test the -- the hypothesis?
I have.
Is anybody up here
a wine spritzer drinker?
'cause I'm not.
I am. Yeah.
How does it compare?
Um, it feels -- It tastes to me
less sweet than a spritzer.
Do men ever drink a spritzer?
I associate it with a woman.
Yeah, they do.
In the summertime --
No, they don't.
Yeah.
Yes, they do.
In the summertime, a rosé.
SICILIANO: They do.
Do they?
[ deep voice ]
Not real men.
Rosé wine with, um --
With ice in it
started in the South
of France in Saint-Tropez
back in the '50s.
It's now extremely popular
in North America.
Jayla, who is
the target customer?
So, the target customer
is a woman
who has a really busy
either career or she's a mom,
she likes to drink wine
at least a few days a week,
but she has to wake up
super early the next morning.
So she can drink your product,
not get a hangover.
She feels better
the next day,
but she's comfortable
in a social setting.
Yeah, it's kind of that
guilt-free option.
This is kind of like a skinny
margarita alternative, right?
Yep.
Right now we're selling
in 10 Whole Foods
from L.A. to San Diego.
We just went
into our first Albertsons.
We're approved to go
into three more Whole Foods,
and we're approved
for five more Albertsons.
Because you only have clearance
in California at this point.
Yeah.
And how much have you been
selling in those stores?
Um, we've sold about $11,000
in the last six weeks.
We just launched it.
[ groans ]
Oh, just --
This is brand-new.
You're six weeks old.
Brand-new.
Did you design this bottle?
I think -- I wouldn't mind
having a closer look.
But it's very elegant.
SICILIANO:
Do you want to see?
Is that your background?
Are you a designer of some sort?
Yeah, I did product development
and design
for footwear and bags
for seven years.
Thank you.
Looks very feminine.
HERJAVEC: Jayla, how much money
did you put into this?
I've personally
put in $30,000.
As I said, I quit my job,
and I've been doing
everything I possibly could
to make ends meet.
I went back to bartending.
And when I had
no resources left,
I ended up going out
and pitching investors.
Did you get
any investors?
I did.
I ended up getting $450,000.
Oh.
Whoa.
Wow.
From who?
From?
And we -- Um,
from two private investors
that I didn't know
beforehand.
Um, I got a $2.61 million
valuation on that first round.
[ laughs ]
I did. Hey.
You're
a pretty good salesman.
Maybe I'm a mini-sharkette.
No kidding.
[ laughs ]
And today you're asking
$150,000 for 35%.
So you're diluting
your original shareholders.
The whole company believes
a partnership with you guys
would be worth it.
Wow.
You -- You've run
out of money.
SICILIANO:
Let me explain what happened.
So basically,
we got that $450,000.
It was off to the races.
Let's go.
I had a bottler in Michigan
who had a really great
reputation at the time.
They bottled for --
Something must have
gone wrong.
It did.
It went very, very wrong.
Our initial production run,
we lost about 90% of it
due to leaky caps.
Why did it leak?
SICILIANO: They basically didn't
put them on there correctly.
It was very devastating,
obviously.
After all that,
our existing investors
actually put in
another $150,000.
How much money was lost
in that little faux pas?
We lost over $100,000
worth of inventory.
Oh!
So when they put in
another $150,000,
the -- the total
is still $450,000?
No, the total to date
is $700,000,
so they put in more,
our existing investors.
Whoa.
Our goal is to grow this.
We think there's potential for
an acquisition down the road.
You look at all the
coconut waters that
have been acquired...
[ laughs ] 'cause it's just
like coconut water, right?
...Skinnygirl margarita.
O'LEARY: Got to get
to $10 million.
Yeah, we'll --
$10 million in sales
to acquire.
I agree, yeah. Coconut water
wasn't there before.
I think this is
an amazing category.
It's just
the amount of money
you're -- that you're gonna
need for this is massive.
Jayla --
Well, there's lots
of beverages have --
That have grown out
their grassroots style.
And the benefit -- I mean,
we saw skinnygirl margarita
pave the path
for the low-calorie, but --
Very, very, very rare.
Hpnotiq, skinnygirl --
Very rare.
She had hundreds
of hours of television,
and she really hit a certain
audience that didn't expect it.
Jayla, who is
the number-one buyer
of wine in this country
on Earth?
Women?
No. Costco.
Oh. Costco, yeah.
Of course.
So, west
of the Mississippi,
there's one buyer
right here in California.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you
go see her?
Costco? I would love to.
Yeah.
It took me a year to
get into Whole Foods,
and you guys could --
And she might listen to your
story and give you a test,
and it's only one buyer
for the largest buyer of wine
on Earth,
just one phone call.
No, I'm not opposed
To it at all. I think --
Kevin, are you gonna marry her
or make her an offer?
No, but I-I'm trying
to help her...
SICILIANO: Yeah.
...Because I'm in her business,
but I understand --
I think you could help me
get that meeting.
No, I know, but I-it's --
You know,
you're in --
You're in a difficult situation,
because you've taken down
a lot of investor dollars
to try and build a whole new
category in the wine business.
But I think you've got a lot --
A tough road ahead.
That's exactly
what you should do.
And I never give advice,
but I know this space very well.
Go do that, and good luck
to you. I'm out.
I am amazed
that you were able
to raise $700,000
from your investors.
It wasn't easy.
CORCORAN: Right.
You're an amazing salesperson,
truly,
but I really think you have
a double sell --
Sell the category,
sell the brand.
And I think it's gonna be
a heck of a long haul,
and it's gonna take
so much more money,
and I'm just not willing
to put that money in.
I'm out.
Okay.
