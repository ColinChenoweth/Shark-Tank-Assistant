My name is Jayla Siciliano.
I'm from Solana Beach,
California,
My name is Jayla Siciliano,
HERJAVEC: Jayla,
if I ordered
a normal glass
of red wine,
your product,
how many calories?
So, this has half the calories
of regular wine.
What is the purpose of the
electrolytes that you mentioned?
You know, we make no claims.
It's alcohol.
It's not wheatgrass.
So we always say
the electrolytes are in there
'cause why not?
[ laughs ]
SICILIANO: They do.
Do they?
[ deep voice ]
Not real men.
Rosé wine with, um --
With ice in it
started in the South
of France in Saint-Tropez
back in the '50s.
It's now extremely popular
in North America.
Jayla, who is
the target customer?
So, the target customer
is a woman
who has a really busy
either career or she's a mom,
she likes to drink wine
at least a few days a week,
but she has to wake up
super early the next morning.
So she can drink your product,
not get a hangover.
She feels better
the next day,
but she's comfortable
in a social setting.
Yeah, it's kind of that
guilt-free option.
This is kind of like a skinny
margarita alternative, right?
Yep.
Right now we're selling
in 10 Whole Foods
from L.A. to San Diego.
We just went
into our first Albertsons.
We're approved to go
into three more Whole Foods,
But it's very elegant.
SICILIANO:
Do you want to see?
Is that your background?
Are you a designer of some sort?
Looks very feminine.
HERJAVEC: Jayla, how much money
did you put into this?
I've personally
put in $30,000.
SICILIANO:
Let me explain what happened.
So basically,
we got that $450,000.
It was off to the races.
Let's go.
I had a bottler in Michigan
who had a really great
reputation at the time.
They bottled for --
Something must have
gone wrong.
It did.
It went very, very wrong.
Our initial production run,
we lost about 90% of it
due to leaky caps.
Why did it leak?
SICILIANO: They basically didn't
put them on there correctly.
It was very devastating,
obviously.
After all that,
our existing investors
actually put in
another $150,000.
How much money was lost
in that little faux pas?
We lost over $100,000
worth of inventory.
Oh!
So when they put in
another $150,000,
the -- the total
is still $450,000?
No, the total to date
is $700,000,
so they put in more,
our existing investors.
Whoa.
Our goal is to grow this.
We think there's potential for
an acquisition down the road.
You look at all the
coconut waters that
have been acquired...
[ laughs ] 'cause it's just
like coconut water, right?
...Skinnygirl margarita.
O'LEARY: Got to get
to $10 million.
Yeah, we'll --
$10 million in sales
to acquire.
I agree, yeah. Coconut water
wasn't there before.
I think this is
an amazing category.
It's just
the amount of money
you're -- that you're gonna
need for this is massive.
Jayla --
Well, there's lots
of beverages have --
That have grown out
their grassroots style.
Jayla, who is
the number-one buyer
of wine in this country
on Earth?
Women?
No. Costco.
Oh. Costco, yeah.
Of course.
So, west
of the Mississippi,
there's one buyer
right here in California.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you
go see her?
Costco? I would love to.
Yeah.
