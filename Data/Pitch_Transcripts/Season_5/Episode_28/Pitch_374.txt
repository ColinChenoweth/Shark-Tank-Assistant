And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,
HERJAVEC: Wow.
CORCORAN: Wow.
Remarkable.
JOHN: Good, good, good.
Excellent, excellent. Well done.
Well done, guys.
Thank you. So seriously,
you guys want to take a try,
sit in it, lift it up?
HERJAVEC: Yeah, man, yeah.
So, it's about half
the weight
of a comparable plastic
or fiberglass boat.
I knew this was needed
on the market,
You can't touch this market
without even $5 million
to get started.
I know this journey --
Very, very hard,
Mark, I have put everything
I have into this.
I am laser-focused.
I am 100% dedicated.
I'm the most resourceful person
you'll come across.
What's the one thing
you need?
Mark, I will take it.
You are
a tough negotiator.
I am.
I'm tough as hell.
Thank you so much.
No problem. My pleasure.
I'm excited. My -- My wife
would love it, too.
I-I don't think Mark gets
The concept of "Shark Tank."
[ laughs ]
You take
small businesses,
You're so tough, Mark.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, all. Appreciate it.
Good luck.
Congratulations.
Being here today,
getting this opportunity,
and then getting a deal
with Mark makes me realize
every single day, every tear,
every struggle
has been totally worth it.
JOHN: You're gonna regret
that one, man.
We'll find out, right?
It's not like I'm spending
$10 million just as an option
on a big business.
If it works,
it's worth a lot of money.
I know what we're getting
from Mark for Christmas, guys.
Bon Affair!
NARRATOR:
Next up is a treasure hunter
with a unique opportunity
for the sharks.
Ahoy, sharks.
My name is Mark Hargitt.
Okay, sharks,
here is the scuttlebutt.
So, Mark,
what is your offer?
I need $250,000 for 25%
of my business.
What do we get for that,
Mark?
Well, you'll get 25%
of, um, the booty.
The booty being that ore, the
rocks we were looking at there?
Well, there's more than that.
There is artifacts.
The wholesale value of the ore
I estimate
at around $2.4 million
if I can gather it all,
if I get the right equipment.
Mark, how did you find
the treasure?
Well, research
is the key there.
I'm a nautical
amateur historian.
I grew up
in the marine industry.
I'm the seventh son
of a seventh son
of a son of a son of a sailor.
Are you the only person
that knows
the GPS coordinates
of where it is?
Oh, heck no.
This is a well-known wreck.
Oh, it is?
Yeah, so why -- Yeah, so why
hasn't it been salvaged before?
Well, it has.
What gives you
the rights to it, Mark?
Well, I filed a claim
with the state of Alaska,
basically a mineral claim.
If it's been salvaged before,
how do we know with certainty
that the ore is still there?
Here it is.
What's that?
What's that?
HERJAVEC: Why does it smell
so bad, Mark?
Well, because it was underwater
a few days ago.
Some of this is ore
that hasn't been smelted,
HERJAVEC:
So, Mark, let's say --
This is actually
a copper concentrate.
So you're assuming
there is "x" amount
of mineral down there?
Where else would it go?
Other people.
Plenty of things could have
Salvaged -- Other people
could have salvaged it.
Yes, they have, but they've
picked the cherries off.
They've gotten, like,
the ship's wheel,
O'LEARY: Okay, so, Mark,
if I want to invest
in treasure hunting,
there's many guys I can go to.
I'm gonna make that assumption.
O'LEARY: There's lots
of competitors.
Mm-hmm.
If I just started
to do my due diligence,
why am I picking you?
Well, because I'm the captain.
I'll do this operation.
I've been in salvage
all my life,
21 years
in the merchant marines.
I've saved ships.
I've had my life saved.
I've saved others.
This is, uh -- I'm the guy.
I can do this for you.
Good for you, Mark.
CORCORAN: Isn't there someone
in your industry
Mark, I get pitched this
all the time --
This treasure,
that treasure.
Everybody e-mail --
You do?
Do you really, Mark?
Oh, yeah. All the time.
There goes my lunch meeting
with you.
Oh, yeah. [ laughs ]
I've been pitched a lot
of treasure hunts.
There's just too much risk
here, Mark.
I like you.
I like what you're doing.
You're a great guy.
But I'm out.
I'm falling in love with
the romance of the idea --
You know, diving deep,
salmon boats.
You know, maybe I get
into this investment,
Good luck
with the treasure, Mark.
You bet. Thanks.
Well, you know, we've never had
an investment here
where one of the risk
is real sharks.
Do you know why they haven't
actually done that?
Because the cost
of taking it out is gonna
be more than $2 million.
That isn't cheap.
I mean, it's --
It's really expensive.
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank is a couple
with a twist
on a decadent dessert.
My background
in brand marketing
Wow.
SHANNON:
And for Mark,
we have
our almond raspberry.
All right.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
I'm gonna listen.
Do we have a chance to talk
about the switching...
HERJAVEC: Sure.
...The business model
real quick?
We'll be back
in one second.
Okay.
Yes.
All right.
Mark, I know exactly
what you're gonna do,
you little snake over there
on the corner.
What am I gonna do?
You're gonna come in,
listen to what they say,
of Mark Cuban standing up
and saying,
"I'll take that deal."
[ laughter ]
You know it, too.
