And my name
is Shannon Radke.
Thank you so much
for having us.
We're super excited
to be here.
Our company
is called Cinnaholic,
and we're looking
for a $200,000 investment
in return for 20%
of our company.
and with s-Shannon's talent
for baking,
we created the world's
best cinnamon-roll experience.
At Cinnaholic,
it's all about custom,
gourmet cinnamon rolls.
We start you off
with a fresh cinnamon roll
right out of the oven,
and then you can choose
from over 30 different
frosting flavors
and 30 different toppings
and create your own
very unique cinnamon roll.
Today, we have a couple rolls
prepared for you.
We're always hungry.
What do we have here?
So, for Robert, we're making
caramel banana cream pie.
You are speaking
my language, Shannon.
Thank you very much.
There you go.
And for Barbara, we're doing
our mocha almond roll.
Thank you very much.
There you go.
And for Kevin, we have
our classic old-school roll.
Oh!
It's vanilla frosting
with strawberry.
Shannon,
it's incredible.
Yay! Thank you!
And for Daymond, we are doing
our coffee cookie dough.
Wow!
Our cookie is
made in-house.
HERJAVEC: Mmm.
Isn't that amazing?
Bless me, Florian. Bless me.
Thank you.
Thank you, Florian.
You're welcome.
Before I go on, how many
calories are in this?
Well, in our typical
old-school roll,
it's about 485, 500, depending
on the size of the roll.
In this?
Yeah.
Yes.
It's about half the calories
of our competitor.
All right, sharks,
we're here
because we need your investment
to open another location
and start
our cinnamon-roll empire.
So who's ready to make
a sweet deal with us?
Did you say
another location?
Yes.
Where is
your current location?
Our current location is
in Berkeley, California.
How many square feet?
It's about
650 square feet.
What are your sales
in that store?
The sales last year
were $260,000.
And before we go
into any more numbers,
there's a little, sweet secret
to our cinnamon rolls
that we haven't
disclosed yet.
There is a secret
to a cinnamon roll?
They're 100% dairy-free,
egg-free, cholesterol-free...
Unbelievable.
They taste the opposite.
Really?
...Allergy friendly,
and 100% vegan.
Yes.
No!
JOHN: Whoa.
There is
50 million Americans
that have
a dairy intolerance.
There is
another 5 million people
who have
severe food allergies,
and the top two are dairy
and eggs in children.
So we have tons of moms
coming in, and they ask,
"oh, my kid cannot have
any dairy or eggs.
Do we have anything
For them?"
we say, "yep.
Knock yourself out."
and out of the $260,000,
what did you net last year?
17%, so $45,000.
And you sell them
for like $4 apiece?
The average r-roll
is $5.50.
Is there another path
to big sales
besides more retail stores?
We went away from thinking
about wanting to go into retail,
like maybe having it
in Whole Foods or whatever,
because we think our product
is only that amazing
if you have the same experience
in the store.
Tell me what the $200,000
is gonna get me.
The $200,000 will get you
another store in San Francisco,
and then from there, we're
gonna go into franchising.
But you don't have
enough money
to go into franchising
at that point,
because you have to get
All the -- The legal documents.
You have to get
all the state approvals.
Costs another quarter
of a million.
Yeah. It's gonna cost
a lot of money to do that.
CORCORAN: Let me get back
to the food for a minute.
This was so delicious,
and it just dawned on me --
When did you make this?
Three days.
Three days ago.
It's three days old?
Yes.
Yes.
You're feeding us this stuff
that tastes so good --
It's three days old?
Exactly.
Do you guys do anything online,
sell online at all?
We have a tiny, little,
small, online store,
just because we
have demand.
Hollywood celebrities
heard about us,
and they wanted
to order stuff,
so in order to fulfill that,
we just put it
like a small, little e-commerce
store online.
You're doing quite well.
The only thing,
getting back to your numbers,
is you've put a million-dollar
valuation on a single store.
It's a lot of buns.
And -- And so you're making
$45,000 for the investor.
That means you're asking
22 times your pretax profit
on a cinnamon-bun store.
The $1 million valuation
is on the brand
and on the concept.
We do believe that could be
a national food chain.
I don't think your business
model is that great
because of my experience
with cousins Maine lobster,
because on one food truck,
they're selling $800,000
a year.
What?
That's -- That's working.
CORCORAN: So, because I've been
spoiled rotten
by their first truck and now
their second truck, I'm out.
The challenge here is I want
to be in this space,
and I think I got
a little jealous
because of Barbara over here
with cousins lobster.
She's doing amazing.
The numbers
aren't there for me,
so I don't think
I can help you.
I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
This is so much like
wicked good cupcakes in Boston.
It's the same thing.
Here comes
a royalty deal.
Here comes
a bloodsucking offer.
Silence, please.
A cupcake operator
in a retail location
decided to change the model
and go to shipping the product.
All of a sudden, they leveraged
themselves up 10,000%.
Their sales went from $15,000
a week to $300,000.
If people knew they could get
this overnighted to them
in a package of six,
it -- it -- you would get
a whole online business
that's extremely profitable
going,
and that may be more
lucrative than opening
up more retail space.
HERJAVEC:
Two problems for me.
One is the --
You're asking for $200,000.
You're gonna invest it all
into a second store,
and then it's gone.
If it works, we then have
to raise more money,
which is not a problem,
but then we try the franchise.
That's one challenge.
My other challenge is
you're valuing the business
at $1 million today.
I-I don't see the value today.
But I want to be involved.
So here's my idea.
All right.
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 40%,
but I don't want to do
another store.
I really like the idea
of putting them
in a nice, little package
and shipping them out.
I think he should pay me a
royalty for that idea right now.
[ laughter ]
I think people
are gonna go online.
We put all the investment
into that presence,
and now that's
a game changer.
All right. Is anything
you wanted to add?
I'm really contemplating
screwing up Robert's offer.
NARRATOR:
Two sharks are out.
Shannon and Florian have
an offer from Robert --
$200,000 for a 40% stake --
But Kevin is also interested.
I'm really contemplating
screwing up Robert's offer.
What I like
about my royalty program
is I don't take
any of your family's equity.
I don't steal 40%
like Robert's proposal.
He just takes
your family's legacy.
All right,
here's an offer for you.
Um, no equity whatsoever.
No, no, but wait.
Cover your neck.
$200-- $200,000.
Was that good? Huh?
Was it?
I also, uh, do not want to see
a second retail location.
You have to go
and actually --
My idea --
Uh, actually, I think
I brought that
to the table originally.
No, I think it was mine.
So, and my royalty
would be $1.20 a unit.
After I recoup my 200k,
it drops down to 60 cents.
In perpetuity
means forever.
But I've already proven
this model in wicked cupcakes.
It's wildly successful.
Florian, I smell
a counteroffer coming.
I would love to be able
to negotiate with you
a little bit
if there is
a little wiggle room.
Um, maybe we can meet
at 35%.
Florian,
here's where I'm at.
I'm gonna say this at the risk
