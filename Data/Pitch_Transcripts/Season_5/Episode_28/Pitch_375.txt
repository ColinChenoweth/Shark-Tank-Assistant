And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
entrepreneur, tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank is
an innovative solution
for the modern
outdoor adventurer.
HERJAVEC: Wow.
CORCORAN: Wow.
Remarkable.
JOHN: Good, good, good.
Excellent, excellent. Well done.
Well done, guys.
Thank you. So seriously,
you guys want to take a try,
sit in it, lift it up?
HERJAVEC: Yeah, man, yeah.
So, it's about half
the weight
of a comparable plastic
or fiberglass boat.
And it's
completely watertight?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can I try it?
Yeah.
You can hop in.
Please. Yeah.
Is it as strong
as fiberglass?
I knew this was needed
on the market,
so I quit my job,
and I decided to go for it,
and that's when Bon Affair
was born.
Bon affair is
the first premium wine spritzer
with California wine,
purified sparkling water,
and electrolytes,
with zero added sugar
and 6.5% alcohol.
I'd love to give you
some samples,
and I want to remind you
that this is not a replacement
for a full-bodied glass of wine.
This is a lighter alternative.
Think of it as the best
sparkling water ever,
'cause it has wine in it.
Are -- Are you okay
with that?
Thank you. Yeah.
CORCORAN: Thank you.
Cheers, Barbara.
To you.
Thank you. [ chuckles ]
whoa.
Thank you, thank you.
You're very welcome.
Toast. Kev.
Cheers.
You can't touch this market
without even $5 million
to get started.
I know this journey --
Very, very hard,
and I've already lost my shirt
on one deal like this.
Daymond, you can help me
get those endorsers, though.
I-I couldn't help
myself.
Yeah.
I'm out.
Okay.
I don't understand
how you raised $700,000
from investors
for a value
Of $2.6 million,
and now, because I'm a wonderful
human being and a shark,
I get a value of $420,000
for the company.
Well, I know our sales
are low.
It doesn't add up for me.
It doesn't add up for me.
It tells me that perhaps
there's bigger challenges.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
Mark, I have put everything
I have into this.
I am laser-focused.
I am 100% dedicated.
I'm the most resourceful person
you'll come across.
What's the one thing
you need?
The one thing I need --
Exposure and contacts.
It took me, as I said, a year
to get into Whole Foods.
I know I'll get
a distributor.
I know I could get into Costco
if I really try.
But I know that with your help,
I could get there a lot faster.
Okay. I like you.
Um, I'm not an expert
in the wine business,
but I like the category.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll offer you
the $150,000...
...for 35%.
[ laughs ]
Mark, I will take it.
You are
a tough negotiator.
I am.
I'm tough as hell.
Thank you so much.
No problem. My pleasure.
I'm excited. My -- My wife
would love it, too.
I-I don't think Mark gets
The concept of "Shark Tank."
[ laughs ]
You take
small businesses,
and you make them
into big businesses.
That's the concept
of "Shark Tank," right?
You're so tough, Mark.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, all. Appreciate it.
Good luck.
Congratulations.
Being here today,
getting this opportunity,
and then getting a deal
with Mark makes me realize
every single day, every tear,
every struggle
has been totally worth it.
JOHN: You're gonna regret
that one, man.
We'll find out, right?
It's not like I'm spending
$10 million just as an option
on a big business.
If it works,
it's worth a lot of money.
If it doesn't,
I'm out time and 150k.
So the risk/reward
is enormous.
You know what?
Worst case, my wife gives
these away at Christmas.
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
You're -- You're gonna have a
garage full of those things.
I know what we're getting
from Mark for Christmas, guys.
Bon Affair!
NARRATOR:
Next up is a treasure hunter
with a unique opportunity
for the sharks.
Ahoy, sharks.
My name is Mark Hargitt.
Okay, sharks,
here is the scuttlebutt.
I'm a treasure hunter,
and I found treasure.
I found 1,200 tons
of copper, silver, and gold ore
sitting in the belly
of the Mariposa,
a ship that sank
almost a hundred years ago
just off the coast of Alaska.
Let me take you there.
Wow.
As you can see,
there's a lot of kelp.
Pretty strong currents.
Going down the anchor line.
Got to hang on, because
the current will sweep you away.
And here's a steam valve.
You can see there's
a lot more artifacts.
Here's one of the fire bricks
from the boiler.
Wow. Very cool.
What was so cool
about that, Rob?
I just love diving
and treasure and --
That could have been a car
in the Hudson river.
[ laughter ]
So, Mark,
what is your offer?
I need $250,000 for 25%
of my business.
What do we get for that,
Mark?
Well, you'll get 25%
of, um, the booty.
The booty being that ore, the
rocks we were looking at there?
Well, there's more than that.
There is artifacts.
The wholesale value of the ore
I estimate
at around $2.4 million
if I can gather it all,
if I get the right equipment.
Mark, how did you find
the treasure?
Well, research
is the key there.
I'm a nautical
amateur historian.
I grew up
in the marine industry.
I'm the seventh son
of a seventh son
of a son of a son of a sailor.
Are you the only person
that knows
the GPS coordinates
of where it is?
Oh, heck no.
This is a well-known wreck.
Oh, it is?
Yeah, so why -- Yeah, so why
hasn't it been salvaged before?
Well, it has.
What gives you
the rights to it, Mark?
Well, I filed a claim
with the state of Alaska,
basically a mineral claim.
If it's been salvaged before,
how do we know with certainty
that the ore is still there?
Here it is.
What's that?
What's that?
Come and look.
CORCORAN: Scared me
when you opened that.
Now, hold your breath.
I got some gloves here.
Oh!
This came --
Just came off the seafloor.
O'LEARY:
This is the ore?
No. This is
actually copper matte.
CORCORAN:
Phew! It stinks.
This is ore.
HERJAVEC: Why does it smell
so bad, Mark?
Well, because it was underwater
a few days ago.
Some of this is ore
that hasn't been smelted,
and some of this
already has.
What does that mean --
Smelted?
That means
it's concentrated.
So it's denser,
it's denser.
HERJAVEC:
So, Mark, let's say --
This is actually
a copper concentrate.
So you're assuming
there is "x" amount
of mineral down there?
Where else would it go?
Other people.
Plenty of things could have
Salvaged -- Other people
could have salvaged it.
Yes, they have, but they've
picked the cherries off.
They've gotten, like,
the ship's wheel,
and the whistle,
and propellers.
But do you think
the entire 1,200 tons
is still down there?
I don't see any reason
why not.
And how much
have you salvaged,
and what type of dollars
has that turned into?
Well, we have just salvaged
a few hundred pounds so far,
because we were doing it
by hand.
If I get three-quarters of it,
I'm thinking around
$2.4 million wholesale.
How long would it take to
salvage the entire mother lode?
I know with the eductor system
I want to build --
It's basically like
an underwater vacuum cleaner --
It would take about a week,
maybe two.
That's it? You could have
the entire mother lode up?
Well, that's
just a rough estimate.
What do you need
the money for?
Well, I need, uh,
equipment, crew.
Um, I need to build
an eductor system,
rent a barge, uh...
Sounds like you have
the equipment, though.
...Lawyers,
guns, shark repellent,
'cause there's real sharks
that swim around.
Sharks?
Yeah. There's real ones
that swim around.
O'LEARY: Okay, so, Mark,
if I want to invest
in treasure hunting,
there's many guys I can go to.
I'm gonna make that assumption.
O'LEARY: There's lots
of competitors.
Mm-hmm.
If I just started
to do my due diligence,
why am I picking you?
Well, because I'm the captain.
I'll do this operation.
I've been in salvage
all my life,
21 years
in the merchant marines.
I've saved ships.
I've had my life saved.
I've saved others.
This is, uh -- I'm the guy.
I can do this for you.
Good for you, Mark.
CORCORAN: Isn't there someone
in your industry
that you could easily go to
and get the money?
You're well known.
You have the experience.
Well, that is true.
You guys are plan "c," actually.
Plan "c"?
[ laughter ]
It's good
to know we're loved.
Well, plan "a"
is to do it by hand.
Plan "b" was to take
my early retirement.
I have half a million
in a retirement account.
Let me -- Let me just ask
this question.
You have the rights
for the minerals
on this ship, correct?
It was granted
exclusive --
Mineral rights, yes.
It was granted
exclusively to you,
which means you're the only one
who can go down there,
bring it up,
and sell it.
Since you have
the exclusive rights,
could you not simply take
your rights,
go to
a big salvage company,
and sell
your rights to them?
I hadn't thought of that.
Yeah, I could.
Welcome to
the Shark Tank.
Yes, yes. Great idea.
Mark, I get pitched this
all the time --
This treasure,
that treasure.
Everybody e-mail --
You do?
Do you really, Mark?
Oh, yeah. All the time.
There goes my lunch meeting
with you.
Oh, yeah. [ laughs ]
I've been pitched a lot
of treasure hunts.
Everybody talks
a grand plan,
but they never turn out
the way they project.
There's just too much risk
here, Mark.
I like you.
I like what you're doing.
You're a great guy.
But I'm out.
I'm falling in love with
the romance of the idea --
You know, diving deep,
salmon boats.
You know, maybe I get
into this investment,
I get my own patch
over my eye and --
Talk like a pirate?
Yeah.
And hang out with you.
Well, I do want you
to go diving on it with me.
I wouldn't have the slightest
idea what you're telling me
or what you're doing or --
I couldn't even advise.
I just -- I can't be of any help
here. I'm sorry. I'm out.
Well, you want to forget
about the money and just
sign on as crew?
There you go.
[ laughter ]
HERJAVEC: Like Daymond,
I love the water.
I love cars,
but I really love boats.
I've been a diver since I was
16 years old, padi certified.
In fact, I ran away from home
when I was 17.
I wanted to join the navy.
True story.
So I love it. Love diving.
Love everything about it.
Well, this is your chance
to go and take it
to the most moneymaking
adventure you've ever had
walk through these doors.
Arrr!
That's right.
But this really isn't
an investment today
I-I-in the kind where I can see
getting a return.
I'm out. Thank you
for coming here, though.
You bet.
CORCORAN: You know what the deal
lacks for me?
First of all, knowledge.
I have no knowledge of this.
I have to totally trust you.
When has that
ever stopped you before?
Yeah. But you know what?
It lacks the sex appeal.
I was hoping when you opened
that big box,
I was gonna see crown jewels,
some diamonds.
Well, it doesn't look like
a treasure chest. that's true.
CORCORAN: Somehow, seeing those
rocks just didn't do it for me.
I'm out. I just wish
it had more sex appeal.
I think that the only person
that's left is...Kevin.
O'LEARY: Very interesting.
First time we ever had
someone like you
in the Shark Tank.
I think there's
lots of risk in this.
It's, uh,
not a slam dunk at all.
It's just very expensive
to get it out.
No, not really.
Well, we don't know that yet.
Anyways, I --
Well, the system
that I want to use
is basically like an underwater
vacuum cleaner, an eductor.
I-I-I've actually seen it work
On a -- On a Roman ship
off the coast of Cyprus
that I got involved in,
and it's a long story,
but that ship now sits
in kyrenia castle.
It's very expensive. It takes
a lot longer than you think.
And that's in warm water
in the Mediterranean.
Here's the thing --
Once you start, you can't stop.
You got to finish it.
Otherwise, the whole
investment's worthless.
So, look, I'm not gonna take
the dive with you.
Good luck to you. I'm out.
Okay.
Good luck
with the treasure, Mark.
You bet. Thanks.
Well, you know, we've never had
an investment here
where one of the risk
is real sharks.
Do you know why they haven't
actually done that?
Because the cost
of taking it out is gonna
be more than $2 million.
That isn't cheap.
I mean, it's --
It's really expensive.
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank is a couple
with a twist
on a decadent dessert.
My background
in brand marketing
Wow.
SHANNON:
And for Mark,
we have
our almond raspberry.
All right.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
I'm gonna listen.
Do we have a chance to talk
about the switching...
HERJAVEC: Sure.
...The business model
real quick?
We'll be back
in one second.
Okay.
Yes.
All right.
Mark, I know exactly
what you're gonna do,
you little snake over there
on the corner.
What am I gonna do?
You're gonna come in,
listen to what they say,
and then give them a nickel more
and close the deal
and tell them they have
the 10-second clock.
Come on!
That's not
what I'm gonna do.
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna say
$250,000, 40%.
I will not give them
a full 10 seconds.
[ laughter ]
We really like your idea
of going into online shipping.
We know our product
ships well.
We don't really like...
You?
...Your business model.
O'LEARY: Think about it.
You'd rather sell 40%
of your equity instead forever.
Yeah, I -- Yes.
That's in perpetuity,
by the way.
of Mark Cuban standing up
and saying,
"I'll take that deal."
[ laughter ]
You know it, too.
I'm -- I'm gonna stay at
the 40%, and I'll tell you why.
If it's worth 40%,
it's worth 35%.
It-it's a relative
small amount.
I mean, either we're
gonna be successful
in a big way together,
and I don't think the 5%
will make a difference.
Do you have anything
to add to it? nothing?
All right,
I-I think --
CORCORAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. don't do that.
Don't lose --
D-don't lose the deal.
What are you gonna say?
Don't you dare
accept a deal when there's
something else on the table.
No. There -- There's
nothing on the table.
O'LEARY: There's nothing
on the table.
Yeah, bird in the hand.
There's nothing
on the table.
So, yeah, we would love
to work with you.
JOHN: All right.
Done.
CUBAN:
Way to go, Robert.
All right.
CORCORAN:
Ay, yi, yi.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You were
just about to lose it.
Awesome. Thanks, guys.
All right, awesome.
Thank you.
All right.
Congratulations.
You guys have a great night.
Thank you.
You're dead to me!
[ laughter ]
The exciting thing
about having Robert
as a partner
is having somebody
who is a serial entrepreneur
who knows
how to scale a business.
We started this business out
of passion for the business.
Now we have a partner who knows
how to blow things up.
