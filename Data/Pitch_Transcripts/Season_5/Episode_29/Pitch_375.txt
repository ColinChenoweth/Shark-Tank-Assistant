Hi.
I'm Dr. Sylvie Shapiro.
And I'm Nicole Brooks.
Sharks, we are asking you
for $75,000
for a 15% stake
in Foot Fairy.
We're both moms,
and when I have to take my
four children to the shoe store,
it looks
something like this.
WOMAN:
No, that is going down!
HERJAVEC:
[ chuckles ]
[ screams ]
[ laughs ]
[ crying ]
[ laughter ]
[ girl shouts ]
Running the three bases.
[ girls screaming ]
With Foot Fairy,
you'll never have
to go through this.
Foot fairy
is an iPad app
that allows you to accurately
measure your child's foot size
in the comfort and convenience
of your own home.
I'm a podiatrist,
and parents
constantly tell me
they just guess
their child's shoe size,
and I see
so many foot problems
associated with kids
wearing the wrong size shoe.
This is my daughter
sienna,
and she'll be demoing
the app for us today.
You simply take the iPad,
place your child's foot
against it,
wait for the chime...
[ chime ]
and presto!
Your child's shoe size
is displayed.
You then have the option
of going to get shoes,
in which you'll be
linked to zappos
to a prepopulated page
of shoes in your child's size.
So, we at Foot Fairy
hope that you shark fairies
will help us
to make every mom's life
just a little bit easier.
And make sure that every child
is in a proper-fitted shoe.
Thank you, sienna.
You can go back to daddy now.
GREINER:
Thanks, sienna.
CORCORAN: Thank you.
Your app is totally done now,
but you'd use the money
to further enhance the app?
What's missing?
Oh, well, we want to build out
the back-end infrastructure,
so we'd love to be able to
store our customer e-mails.
It just really gives us a way
to encourage people
to buy shoes,
to remind them, because --
But you're not
selling them shoes, right?
Why is there an upside
for that?
We are.
Oh, actually,
that's our sales model.
Our app is free.
We have an affiliate sales model
with zappos
where we get
between 8% to 18%.
How many downloads of the app
do you have today?
13,144.
But we just launched
three weeks ago officially.
HERJAVEC: In the three weeks
you've been doing it,
have you actually gotten
a commission check from zappos?
No.
We have
a 98% click-through rate,
but we cannot
track our commission
because
there was a glitch.
It was going to the zappos app
rather than --
Have you fixed that glitch?
That's a very important glitch.
We fixed that
about three days ago.
GREINER:
That's a big click-through rate.
It was a very big one.
It's a very big click-through.
We are very excited.
GREINER: It's a very big
click-through rate.
But where are you
on the home page?
Like, I'm curious,
as you launch --
We went directly
from our app to a pre--
No, no, no.
But wait, wait, wait.
I have a question. It's,
like, getting crazy in here.
Sorry, sorry. Sorry!
HERJAVEC: Wow.
Here's my question.
Is zappos doing anything
to advertise you
so that people
are going to your app?
No. We don't need zappos
to advertise.
We are confident.
We spent $2,600
and got over 13,000 downloads
in less than 3 weeks.
Also, I mean,
another way to make money
besides
just the click-through
is we'd love to have advertising
and sponsorships.
But tell me -- Why don't they
put you on their main site?
Um...
We have such a
targeted market of moms.
If it -- If it helps --
GREINER: They should.
It's an accessory.
Well, maybe that's something
you could help us with.
It's like a help
to their customers.
We would love
to be on zappos' main site.
We would love to be.
Yeah.
Did you suggest it
in a meeting?
It's a podiatrist,
therapist mom.
[ chuckles ]
Did you suggest it?
We're here
to answer your questions.
HERJAVEC: Wow, Nicole, you're
like that dog in that movie.
When we --
Like, he's walking along
doing one thing, and he
Sees -- "Squirrel!"
[ laughter ]
I'm really committed
to this.
She is. She's --
And I'm committed --
I'm committed to showing you all
how fabulous this idea is.
And we know that
we can make you see --
CUBAN: But, n-Nicole --
O'LEARY:
Why aren't you telling me
about something proprietary
or a patent or a technology
or software no one can emulate?
We're the propri--
We are the -- I'm a podiatrist.
You're -- You're it?
L-ladies, if it works --
If it works
and you get 10,000 orders...
We're n-- We're gonna get
500,000 downloads at least.
Okay. You're -- You're dead
before that happens.
And each --
You had a great idea.
There's nothing proprietary
About it -- Bang! --
The guys that care
are gonna emulate this.
No, actually,
they can't.
Because what you have here
is expertise and passion.
I'm out.
GREINER:
You know what?
I've never seen somebody
so exuberant about what
they're doing as the two of you.
For me, it's not a business yet.
You're just at the very start.
I'm out.
HERJAVEC:
Nicole, I love the excitement.
When you first came out,
I thought it was a great idea.
And my first thought was,
"Wow, I can't believe this isn't
On the zappos website today."
So, the question is
is it such a difficult
technology to create
that nobody else could do it?
CUBAN:
Who wrote the software?
We have a tech-- Technology team
that worked with both of us.
To create --
And where'd you get
your technology team?
Where did we
get them from?
Yeah.
We researched it,
and we found them.
We -- Yeah.
But, Sylvie, do you realize,
by virtue of that answer,
if you were able to, as
non-programming-computer people,
find somebody who could write
it, I-it could be duplicated.
You know what?
Anything can be duplicated.
But -- But I guess, there's
nothing proprietary with it.
No, Robert.
Please don't say that.
[ laughter ]
I'm out.
So, that -- That leaves
Barbara and Mark.
CORCORAN: I think, uh,
you're a perfect example
of, "Enthusiasm is not enough."
You're wildly enthusiastic,
but that's where it ends.
It's a wild card.
I don't know
if it's gonna work,
whether you can
make money on it.
Um, so I couldn't
possibly invest.
I'm out.
And now -- Now we've left
with mister....Mr. Mark.
Um, if some world-renowned
podiatrist walked in the door
and you had
to defend the product
and why it's better than
something this world-renowned
podiatrist could create,
what would you say?
Because this is
what I'm passionate about.
CUBAN:
No, forget passion.
T-this --
That's not the right answer.
I'm trying to figure out
what differentiates you.
Okay.
And if I hear the word
"passion" again, I'm out.
'Cause I already know
you're passionate.
The longer the backstory,
the worse the business.
So, world-famous podiatrist
walks in the door
and says,
"Okay, Dr. Foot Mom,
why is yours better
than something I can create?"
Right.
So -- bam --
what's the answer?
NARRATOR:
Four sharks are out.
Sylvie and Nicole
have one more chance for a deal.
So, world-famous podiatrist
walks in the door
and says,
"Okay, Dr. Foot Mom,
"why is yours better
than something I can create?
What is it
that you brought?"
Right.
So -- bam --
what's the answer?
Accuracy.
Why is your accuracy going
to be better than somebody --
Because we spent
over a year
determining
how to make this
the most accurate
shoe-sizing app.
So,
if I did a search for
"app that determines
child's foot size,"
trying to get
a feel for the competition,
what would I see?
You would see ours.
Foot fairy.
What else?
You would see
a couple other apps.
And what I-- And what about
theirs is different than yours?
The mom has
to put the child's foot
and then slide their finger
on it.
BROOKS: A lot of room
for parental error.
It's not as accurate.
We really wanted ours
to be convenient and accurate.
That's why we
went to shopping malls
and had kids test it.
Got it. Got it.
Here --
Here's why I'm interested.
I have a company called
fashion metric,
and they did a whole exhaustive
analysis just on men's shirts.
So,
if you're this body type,
this is the shirt
that fits you in this manner
versus that manner.
Sensors and metrics, I think,
are gonna be huge in the future.
So I like this.
Mm-hmm.
My fear?
You guys
will drive me batty.
They'll put me
in the loony bin, right?
We would love to work with you.
I mean, we really would.
And we -- We won't
drive you batty.
We -- We'll work together,
we will, you know -- we'll
seek any of your advice
that you have.
I mean, I really, really
want to get this to parents.
We really believe, as you said,
that is the future,
that we want to be a --
People to sit in the comfort
of their own home
and be able to have --
Purchase things
that fit them properly
that are for their health
and for their aesthetic.
I'll offer you $100,000...
...For 40%,
but I'm gonna put
contingencies on it, okay?
One -- I get to go through
and test to make sure it works.
Absolutely.
Two--
I get to go through and check
to make sure that
there's nothing comparable.
Three -- I'm gonna
check all the contracts
to make sure that we truly
do own the software,
and that it's well-written.
So, it's 100k, 40%.
Yes or no?
Yes.
Yes.
Done.
Thank you.
And if I need therapy,
I get to call it off.
[ laughs ]
Yeah.
That would be
a door relationship...
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
...So I couldn't --
I couldn't engage in that.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
GREINER: Congratulations.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
High five?
[ both squeals ]
We're so excited that we're
gonna be working with Mark.
[ cheering ]
SHAPIRO: I mean, this is,
like, really a dream come true.
Mr. Cuban,
to work with him --
I-I couldn't have asked
for a better shark.
NARRATOR: This season, we've
seen amazing success stories
from our "Shark Tank"
entrepreneurs.
Whoa! Wow!
DYER:
Business has really taken off
since making a deal
with Kevin and Robert.
We're coming up on half
a million dollars in revenue.
YOUNG: Since partnering with
Lori, in less than eight months,
we've done over $3 million
in sales.
Those aren't projections.
Those are real numbers.
TSELIKIS: We're so lucky to have
made a deal with Barbara.
Just a year later,
we're approaching
$3.5 million in sales.
CUBAN:
What's up, Doug?
MARSHALL:
Making a deal with Mark and Lori
changed our life
beyond our wildest dreams.
MAN: Going on "Shark Tank" has
taken a small, little product
that was run out of my apartment
and made it into
a multimillion-dollar company.
This is a great start,
but this is just the beginning.
I am so proud of you.
Thank you so much, Mom.
One day, I hope to be
the best company in America
for women to work for.
As far as women have come
in the corporate world,
I think there's still
a long ways to go,
and I want to be the one
to make that change happen.
CHILD:
Since "Shark Tank,"
we've done almost $6 million
in sales nationwide.
We like to think
that we're continuing
the tradition
of American innovation.
It's awesome to be able
to create jobs
and provide a living wage
for lots of employees.
CAMERON:
Manufacturing has been gone
for a long time in this state.
But we're bringing it back.
O'LEARY: There's never been
anything like "Shark Tank."
It's the most powerful
venture-capital firm on Earth.
It has sharks, it has money,
and it has millions of people
watching.
When you put all of
those together, magic happens.
QUACKENBUSH:
Our "Shark Tank" experience
has been a roller coaster
of emotion.
To think that
we started in a street tent --
And now what the future
holds for us just blows us away.
WHITEMAN: Each morning, I've
woken up, I've pinched myself.
I just can't believe
this is really happening,
and I just can't wait to see
what happens in the future.
KRUMINS: It brings me to tears
thinking about how proud I am
to show my daughter
that you can do this,
that you can follow your dreams.
I'm truly touched.
Thank you.
NARRATOR:
Next into the tank
are entrepreneurs
with a simple solution
to a tedious
and time-consuming problem.
