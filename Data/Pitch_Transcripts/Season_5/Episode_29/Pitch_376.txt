My name is Kaeya Majmundar.
I'm from Chicago, Illinois,
and I'm a sophomore
at Emory University.
[ all chanting in Hindi ]
I was raised in a very
traditional Indian family.
Both my parents are doctors,
and it was always their dream
for me to become a doctor
as well.
Good job.
Good job.
My childhood summers
were spent practicing violin
and going to the library
and taking math classes.
But it wasn't weird to me,
because that's what all my
Indian friends were doing.
But then I got to college,
and I saw
all these different people
studying different things,
and that excited me.
When I came up with
my fabulous idea,
I knew at that moment
that I had to pursue it.
Creating my product
was actually the easy part.
The hard part
was telling my parents
I no longer
wanted to be a doctor.
I know it's been tough
for you guys.
I'm gonna
make you guys proud, I promise.
My parents had a path for me,
but I completely changed it.
There's a lot of pressure
to succeed,
and failure's not an option.
I want to channel
the hard-work ethic
that my parents and
my grandparents taught me,
and I want to make
my own American dream.
And I need the sharks to do it.
Hi, sharks.
My name is Kaeya Majmundar,
and I'm a sophomore
at Emory University.
My product is bzbox,
and I am seeking $50,000 in
exchange for 20% of my company.
So, this all started after
my freshman year of college.
My friend had asked me to move
her boxes to our storage unit
while she took her chem final.
I agreed, of course,
so I went over,
and I saw her boxes
ready to go by the door.
But as I leaned in
to pick one of them up...
...Everything literally
fell straight through.
That amounted to a long day
of me having to repack
and move all of her stuff.
I decided I had to find
a solution.
That's when I innovated
the bzbox.
Now, Robert,
you're a connoisseur for racing,
so I'm gonna challenge you
to a race today.
So why don't you
come on up here?
Make sure he doesn't
crash your deal.
[ chuckles ]
I thought you were gonna
knock yourself out, there.
So, Robert is going to
assemble the traditional box
that you would buy
from any hardware store,
and I'm gonna
assemble my bzbox.
So, Mark, why don't you
give us your Mark,
and Robert and I
are gonna race.
Are you --
Are you ready?
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. hang on.
What am I doing?
Am I putting this --
You've probably never
assembled a box, have you?
[ laughter ]
Yeah, the truth comes out.
I'm so rich, I hired Kevin
to put boxes together for me.
Oh, my goodness.
On your Mark...
...Get set...
...Go!
All right, I'm done.
Oh! You were whupped.
You suck.
Do it again.
I didn't see it.
All right,
I can do it again.
I just unassembled it,
and now I'm gonna
assemble it again.
Bam, done.
Pretty nice.
MAJMUNDAR: So, sharks,
my flat-folding design
is ideal for anyone
who is looking for a unique,
space-saving, easy-to-use,
and, might I add,
sexy storage solution.
With your expertise
and my drive,
we can target
every houseware, homeware,
craft store, storage store --
You name it.
Man, I'm excited!
'Cause this product,
it will revolutionize
the packing industry.
So, have you done any retail
selling of this product yet?
I have not.
This is brand-new.
I started it
less than a year ago.
I'm a sophomore in college,
and so, I-I thought about it
last year.
What is the cost of your box
versus that box?
If you were looking at,
say, 10,000 units,
the cost for a traditional one
would be under $1.
This one will be $1.75.
Does it ever
get to the same price?
It will with -- With
larger quantities, of course.
You know, I have sold hundreds
of thousands of those boxes
to consumers
in my storage facilities.
That box is actually made
for about 56 cents.
Yeah, I -- My -- My estimate
was for the 10,000 units.
CORCORAN: Do you mind
going back for me?
What is your background?
Yeah, so, I was actually
raised in a family of doctors.
I'm Indian.
Yes, the stereotype is true.
Aww.
My whole family said,
"You know what?
"You're a woman.
You're Indian.
"You cannot do anything
other than medicine
because you're not
gonna make it."
And I said,
"No, absolutely not."
And when I confronted
my parents,
all he-- heck broke loose.
[ laughs ]
It was truly
a-a huge moment in my life.
CORCORAN:
So what happened?
You said,
"Boxes are for me, Mom"?
Yeah, and they laughed.
It was a joke.
It was a joke in my family.
They say, you know, "What do you
want to do with your life?"
And I say, "I want
to be my own boss.
"I have this excellent product,
I have faith,
And I'm going to do it."
Then I signed up to be in
the collegiate entrepreneurs'
organization competition.
That is the largest national
competition for entrepreneurs.
I ended up
winning the competition.
HERJAVEC:
Wow, congratulations.
Congratulations.
And my parents were like,
"Wow. All right."
Did you
file a patent on this?
Uh, yes.
It's patent pending.
I see you have other boxes
up there.
Yes.
Can you show me
the red box?
It's out of plastic?
Plastic, yes.
Yeah.
I'd like to see
how flat that folds down.
One of the things --
It sounds like you've
tried to do some pricing...
Yes.
...To see how this would
price out in the market.
Yes.
Adding this little velcro piece
is very expensive, right?
Yes. Mm-hmm.
Why can't that be done
with another material?
Perhaps another
strip of cardboard?
GREINER:
Well, velcro's super-strong.
It's expensive.
Do you think people are willing
to pay a premium for your box
to knock about 60 seconds
out of their day?
CUBAN:
I don't know.
Absolutely.
O'LEARY: Because that's
the crux of your deal.
Yeah, I don't see it.
Absolutely.
Kaeya, what about
another application?
Have you gone to any large
businesses and met with them?
Yes.
I was approached
by an executive at Lowe's.
They absolutely
loved the product.
Did Lowe's say to you,
"I will buy this product"?
Yes. He said,
"Let's get them into Lowe's."
Did he tell you
how many he would buy?
How many stores
he would put it into?
No, because at that point
in time I wasn't manufacturing.
But he said, "Come back to me.
Let's get it into Lowe's."
I had a meeting in Illinois
at shore's supply stores,
went to the C.E.O.,
and he loved it, as well.
And so, he said
that he will put me in touch
with all of his contacts.
CUBAN: Hopefully,
at some point, you said,
"How many
are you gonna buy?"
Yeah.
What was his response?
He said he was
interested in buying the box,
but he said I would have
to bring it down to be under $1.
Now, what that tells you
is they don't value the utility
more than
their current product.
If they did, they would say,
"I'll pay a penny more."
When I went to go, I wasn't
far enough in the process.
I need to get multiple orders
to match the prices
that they're interested in.
O'LEARY:
So, here's the question.
Can you make it and do you know
at what volumes you'd need
to match the pricing?
What would it take to
get the price down to 56 cents?
It would be
about 400,000 units.
Kaeya, look, I think you've
done a great presentation.
At your age,
I couldn't have stood up here
and presented to
the five of us,
but I don't see the problem
that this solution is fixing.
I'm out.
Thank you, Robert.
Think about this.
You're getting ready
for Christmas.
You have
tons of ornaments downstairs.
They're gonna
clutter your space and --
CUBAN:
You're overthinking.
You've got a solution
and you're trying to
find the problem, okay?
The pain point you solve
is time.
You have to find places
where time is money.
At home, for picking up for
Christmas, time is not money.
Packing up for school,
time is not money.
I respect your opinion,
but I-I must say
that time is always money.
Not --
You're always going to want
a more efficient, more --
A neater way, a more
efficient way to do things.
In fact, you can use it
over and over again.
A-as I listen to you, do --
Do you have it in you
to listen to advice
from somebody else
that maybe you're wrong?
That maybe there is
another way to be successful?
I just sense
that you are that way.
That I'm --
Often, the raw emotion
eventually spills out.
And maybe it's that
you believe so much
that you can dominate
this market with a
more expensive box.
I think people up here
have told you you can't do that.
Well, then, I am very much
open to your suggestions.
I am here to partner with you.
If you feel that you have
a better way to do it,
I am going to go all in.
I will do whatever it is
that you want me to do.
If you tell me to jump,
I won't ask you how high.
I'll pull out the trampoline
and I'll --
Right.
But, at some point,
you got to get the money.
You've got
to close the deal.
You've got to go find somebody
who's willing to write a check.
But right now,
that person is not me.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
Barbara, Lori, Kevin?
CORCORAN: Um,
a couple things, Kaeya.
You have
a wonderful idea,
but you lack two traits that
every great entrepreneur has.
One is the ability
to listen.
The other thing is,
an entrepreneur,
by instinct, whenever
they have an opportunity
and someone says --
The Lowe's guy, what did he say?
"I want your box."
The only answer you give
as an entrepreneur
is, "Yes, sir.
How many?"
And then you find a way
to get it.
But you weren't ready.
I am -- I'm listening.
I understand.
You don't mind if I speak
quite bluntly to you, right?
You are not
an entrepreneur.
I'm out.
You don't mind if I speak
quite bluntly to you, right?
You are not
an entrepreneur.
I'm out.
Now, I am worried
about what Barbara said
'cause I felt
the same thing myself.
You just don't listen.
But I like your idea.
I believe
that if your box
was the same price as
what I sell my customers now,
they would buy yours
instead.
So, this challenge is all about
getting your price down.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you the $50,000.
I want 50%.
[ scoffs ]
50% --
I'm your partner.
And I have no idea how much
trouble it's going to be
to get the price down
to 56 cents.
That's gonna be
your only task for me
after I give you
that $50,000.
I want you to go out
and figure it out
and come back to me
when it's 56 cents.
Are you willing
to do that?
Is that the only offer
that I'm going to get?
It may be.
I don't know.
Lori?
For me, there's some problems
with this.
Come on, Lori.
I think it's really clever.
You're really smart.
And I like that you say,
"I'll jump as high as you want,"
because that's the kind of
person that I like to work with.
Just try it with me, Lori.
It -- [ sighs ]
Please. just, please.
You are a genius,
and I know it.
I know everything
about the companies
that you've worked with.
If it's going
to get off the ground,
I know that you're the partner
that I need.
I-I promise you
you will not regret it.
You will get your money back.
I am -- I am the partner
for you.
I'm out.
You never say that
when you're negotiating
after you've got an offer.
'Cause you don't know
what the outcome is.
You made a huge mistake.
Please, Lori, please.
Just listen to me.
I will work for you.
I will listen to you.
I will do anything it takes.
I will get you your money back.
Kaeya...
...I'm gonna
make you an offer.
The offer's
going to be this --
$50,000,
40% of the business,
contingent on
if we can figure out
how to manufacture this
as a storage box.
'Cause it's got problems.
But you are the kind of person
I like to work with
because I know that you will do
whatever it takes to get there
no matter what.
It's really gonna be
something to figure out,
but I'm willing to take
the journey with you.
Lori, you have a deal.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
We'll figure it out.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
[ sniffles ]
CUBAN: She would have
benefited a whole lot more
by going through this herself
'cause she's so smart
she would have learned more
by figuring it out.
But she'll also
learn a lot from me.
Oh, I'm sure she will.
I thought --
You know,
sometimes it's better
to be able to learn
from a good mentor
than to fall
on your face.
The truth is, unless you can
make these boxes for 56 cents,
you will sell zero.
We'll see down the road,
you know?
You're braver than I am.
I couldn't have done it.
What happened?
I got a deal.
Oh, you did?
Oh, I'm so happy.
Awesome.
What happened?
Who did you get it with?
Lori.
Are you serious?
We're so happy for you.
MAJMUNDAR: Lori believe in me
and believed in my product,
and Lori and I are gonna
make this the best
product it will be.
