My name is Kaeya Majmundar.
I'm from Chicago, Illinois,
My name is Kaeya Majmundar,
MAJMUNDAR: So, sharks,
my flat-folding design
is ideal for anyone
who is looking for a unique,
space-saving, easy-to-use,
Kaeya, what about
another application?
Kaeya, look, I think you've
done a great presentation.
At your age,
I couldn't have stood up here
CORCORAN: Um,
a couple things, Kaeya.
You have
a wonderful idea,
but you lack two traits that
every great entrepreneur has.
One is the ability
to listen.
The other thing is,
an entrepreneur,
by instinct, whenever
they have an opportunity
Kaeya...
...I'm gonna
make you an offer.
The offer's
going to be this --
$50,000,
40% of the business,
contingent on
if we can figure out
how to manufacture this
as a storage box.
'Cause it's got problems.
But you are the kind of person
I like to work with
because I know that you will do
whatever it takes to get there
no matter what.
It's really gonna be
something to figure out,
but I'm willing to take
the journey with you.
Lori, you have a deal.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
We'll figure it out.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

CUBAN: She would have
benefited a whole lot more
by going through this herself
'cause she's so smart
she would have learned more
by figuring it out.
But she'll also
learn a lot from me.
Oh, I'm sure she will.
I thought --
You know,
sometimes it's better
to be able to learn
from a good mentor
than to fall
on your face.
The truth is, unless you can
make these boxes for 56 cents,
you will sell zero.
We'll see down the road,
you know?
You're braver than I am.
I couldn't have done it.
What happened?
I got a deal.
Oh, you did?
Oh, I'm so happy.
Awesome.
What happened?
Who did you get it with?
Lori.
Are you serious?
We're so happy for you.
