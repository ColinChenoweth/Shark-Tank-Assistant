Hello, sharks.
My name is Wayne sikorcin.
My name is Scott Smith.
Our company is Tie-Not,
and we're here today
seeking $125,000
of your hard-earned money
in exchange for 10% equity
in our company.
Tie-Not was invented
to cure an epidemic
that occurs worldwide
every year
from sore fingers from tying
these tiny water balloons.
We're excited today, sharks,
to show you two of our items --
The Tie-Not filler
and the Tie-Not tying stick.
With these two items,
anyone and everyone
can simply fill and tie
water balloons in seconds.
Ba-bam!
O'LEARY: Oh, yeah, that's --
That's pretty cool.
CORCORAN:
Pretty cool.
GREINER:
Wow. Yeah.
So, now even
"Sausage-Fingers" Smith
can now tie
these little water balloons.
Oh, gosh!
[ laughter ]
Just in case you missed it,
you take our Tie-Not filler --
It attaches
to any garden hose --
And you insert
the Tie-Not stick.
The stick is universal 'cause
you can tie the water balloons
by the stick
by hand, also.
I want to try it.
Let me load it up
for you, Kev.
I have
to load it myself.
I have to learn
'cause I just bought it.
You're not at the store.
SIKORCIN:
Slip on a balloon.
Now tilt it forward.
[ laughter ]
I tilt it forward, right?
Push your piston down.
The orange piston
fills the balloon.
All right.
Now what? I just --
Swing it
around the stick.
CUBAN: Oh, my God.
There you go.
Now pull it off and put it
through the top of the slot.
Let go.
Pull the balloon
straight off.
Did it work?
GREINER:
It worked.
Voilà!
And he even wrapped it around
several times.
CUBAN: TA-da!
Very cool.
Kevin.
[ gasps ]
Oh!
[ laughter ]
Oh! I didn't see that coming.
If that had broken,
I'd kill you.
That was...
SIKORCIN: Now we're ready
for your questions.
Can we see them?
Well, yes, you can.
[ laughs ]
Okay.
So, you got one packaged
and you got one loose.
I kept it loose so you
can appreciate the
technology behind it.
Thank you.
So, you were saying that you
don't have to own both things.
You can just have
the stick...
You can just have the stick.
...Or you can have
the filling device, too?
Yes, correct.
CORCORAN: What do you miss
when you just have the stick?
GREINER:
So, the stick would work
if you did it out of your sink?
Yes.
So, how did you
come up with the idea?
What it was is, my wife
bought 250 water balloons
for a family picnic
back in 2008,
and I got the tedious task
of tying these things.
My kids couldn't tie them.
So, I tied like 15.
Kids ripped through it
in like two seconds,
and I said,
"I'm done."
But I wasn't done
thinking about the problem.
So every day after work,
I'd come home, I'd sketch,
and one day, my daughter Abby
looks at one of my sketches,
and says,
"That looks like a stick."
So she goes and grabs a stick,
brings it in to me.
I carve out
a little pocket and a slot,
we go outside
and tied a water balloon.
Hmm.
And I was like,
"Whoa. It just tied."
So then I followed
all the proper procedures.
We went
for patents first.
So, I built an eight-cavity mold
after the patents issued,
and we made it
to the toy fair in 2010.
And that's where
we launched our product.
What did you sell of it?
First year?
$112,000.
Yeah.
Good for you.
What does this sell for?
It sells for $4.99,
and it comes with 50 balloons.
And what's your cost
to make the entire package?
Uh, it's about $1.50
right now.
Why isn't this product
Sort of $7.99?
Why does it have to be $4.99?
[ chuckling ]
We asked the same question.
We started out at $9.99,
and we sold a boatload of them.
Then what happened
to that price?
Well...
We got into
a licensing agreement
with a large toy company.
What was your percentage
on the licensing agreement?
6%.
Kevin, what do you
think about that?
You know, thank goodness
you've met me.
[ laughter ]
'Cause you got
a low-end deal.
7% to 11% is the range.
What were your total sales last
year, including the licensing?
$340-- With the licensing,
$385,000.
But you still have
the license agreement in place?
Yes, we do.
It's in place.
When --
Is there minimums on it?
Yes, there are.
Yes.
And they're hitting -- Obviously
hitting their minimums.
Is there an escalator
in the minimums every year?
No, there's no escalator.
Oh!
Oh, you're
such a bad negotiator.
Ooh.
And how many more years --
How much longer does it go?
Well, it renews
every year.
Oh, oh, really?
Autorenew or you can --
Yeah, we didn't want to
lock in anything long term.
So can you cancel it
at your option?
Oh, yeah. We got like, what is
it, a 90-day out of jail?
CORCORAN: You're kidding?
Cancel it.
We have a 60-day
get-out-of-jail agreement.
Oh, that's cool.
O'LEARY:
You know, l-look.
Your cash flows don't justify
your $1.25 million valuation.
That's the problem.
You're overpricing
your value right now.
If you license it with all
the players, it was never --
Yeah, but you're asking me
to pay
for what I can
bring the business to now.
It's -- It's not interesting
for me.
Yeah, I could add a lot of
value, but I got to wet my beak.
I understand.
That's a big,
old beak, too.
Yeah.
Guys, look -- Kevin's
the toy maven, I'm not.
I think it's great.
You guys deserve
a ton of credit.
I-it really is
an ingenious product.
SMITH: Whoo!
SIKORCIN: Whoo!
Whoo!
GREINER: [ chuckles ]
I'm out.
[ laughter ]
Thank you
for the opportunity.
Absolutely.
Hey, guys, I-I love --
I love the toy business.
And I like businesses that
bring a smile to your face...
Yes.
...And make me happy
and make money.
Yes.
But your --
Your value's a little crazy.
$1.25 million?
I-it's not there today.
I'm out.
Thank you
for the opportunity.
We appreciate it.
You know, for me,
this is a perfect QVC product.
It really, really is.
GREINER: Actually, it --
You know what?
It really kind of isn't
because it's
too inexpensive, actually,
to be a good QVC product.
You have to be really more in
like a $12 or $15 price range.
Just tell them
it's genius.
Whoo!
Whoo!
[ laughter ]
Oh, is that
the key word?
It's genius.
SIKORCIN: Whoo!
[ laughter ]
It's genius.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Now you're
playing with us.
Believe me,
our wives hate it.
To me, just the valuation,
I-it's not there for me.
You're not at $1.25 million.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Let me ask you this.
Where would you value us?
What did you make
on $380,000?
What'd you make last --
$40,000.
And how much you p--
You guys paying each other?
Or, yourselves?
Well, we're
building a brand,
so no one's taking
any money out of it.
Nothing's
taken out of it.
So, that's $40,000
before you took a penny out.
That's correct.
Yeah.
So it's $40,000?
Why so low?
Where did all the money go?
Trade shows.
Trade shows.
We're always marketing,
right?
Guys, I've been in the toy
industry a long, long time.
A business like this
will be at five-times cash flow,
you're worth about $200,000.
So you're not worth
$1.25 million.
That's reality.
Where I would have
loved to have seen this product
was before you did that
license deal, 'cause
that's my specialty.
I really can't help you
that much.
It's not big enough for me.
I like big.
How do you get big
without a strategic partner?
Yeah. I'm sorry, guys.
I'm out.
You know, it's a hard one,
because I love the product.
Because I have probably blown up
5 million water balloons.
I'm the go-to mom in the
neighborhood in the summertime.
We just gave you
more margarita time.
Absolutely.
[ laughter ]
Oh, good.
Now, I'll make you an offer.
I'm gonna give you the $125,000
for 25% of your business.
Wow.
SIKORCIN:
That's fair.
O'LEARY: Incredible offer.
Wait.
Yeah. Very good.
But I'm gonna give it to you
in the form of $50,000 cash,
$75,000 credit line.
I think where we're at
is we're more comfortable
with an 18% offer...
...The $50,000 in cash
and $100,000 in credit line
to move us into next year.
Because we are
really gonna need inventory,
so that's where I'm gonna need
to really tap into resources.
Wow.
Well, bring it on down,
baby.
[ laughter ]
I'm gonna give you
a chance to reconsider.
You've heard my offer.
You know the Shark Tank.
You obviously know
what I could bring to the table.
So I'm not going
to negotiate that.
Okay, can you
Work a little bit -- 20%?
We got a deal right now.
Lock hands, we do
the dance together, 20%.
I don't think so.
I think I'll stay
with what I offered.
Whoa.
She's tough.
I'm not tough.
I'll do the dance,
but at 25%.
If I do the dance,
will you do it at 20%?
[ laughter ]
Um...
Honestly,
I can't come there.
All right, I'm out.
All right.
Good luck.
I can't believe
they didn't take your offer.
It was a decent offer.
Hey, I like when entrepreneurs
stick their ground and
believe in their value.
SIKORCIN: Although Barbara's
offer was very fair,
we just needed to see eye to eye
on the equity value,
and she took too much.
Tie-Not has
a huge growth potential.
