Hello, sharks.
My name is Wayne sikorcin.
My name is Scott Smith.
So, now even
"Sausage-Fingers" Smith
can now tie
these little water balloons.
Oh, gosh!
[ laughter ]
Just in case you missed it,
you take our Tie-Not filler --
It attaches
to any garden hose --
SIKORCIN:
Slip on a balloon.
Now tilt it forward.
[ laughter ]
I tilt it forward, right?
Push your piston down.
The orange piston
fills the balloon.
All right.
Now what? I just --
Swing it
around the stick.
CUBAN: Oh, my God.
There you go.
SIKORCIN: Now we're ready
for your questions.
Can we see them?
Well, yes, you can.
[ laughs ]
Okay.
SMITH: Whoo!
SIKORCIN: Whoo!
Whoo!
GREINER: [ chuckles ]
I'm out.
[ laughter ]
Thank you
for the opportunity.
Absolutely.
Hey, guys, I-I love --
I love the toy business.
SIKORCIN: Whoo!
[ laughter ]
It's genius.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Now you're
playing with us.
Believe me,
our wives hate it.
To me, just the valuation,
I-it's not there for me.
You're not at $1.25 million.
Wow.
SIKORCIN:
That's fair.
O'LEARY: Incredible offer.
Wait.
Yeah. Very good.
But I'm gonna give it to you
in the form of $50,000 cash,
$75,000 credit line.
I think where we're at
is we're more comfortable
with an 18% offer...
SIKORCIN: Although Barbara's
offer was very fair,
we just needed to see eye to eye
on the equity value,
