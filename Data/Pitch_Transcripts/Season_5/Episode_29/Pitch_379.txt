Hi, sharks.
My name is Matt Griffin.
And I'm his wife,
pastry chef Emily Griffin,
and we're from
Carmel, Indiana.
We own baker's edge,
and we are seeking $400,000
for 20% of our company.
We have completely
reinvented bakeware.
Everyone loves brownies,
but have you ever
stopped to think about
which brownie
is really the best?
In a normal pan
of brownies,
you have a middle and a ring
of outside-edge pieces.
And if you're like
a lot of people,
you always go for
those corners and edges first.
Realizing the edges are
where the baking magic happens,
we put on
our thinking caps
and came up with a whole new way
to make brownies.
In our pan, every brownie
has at least two chewy edges.
The pan's bottom rises up
and allows heat to evenly
circulate around every brownie,
caramelizing and edgifying
every single brownie in the pan.
For the past several years,
we have dominated the larger,
multinational brands.
We now want
to leverage that success,
and we want to launch
a line of conventional bakeware.
We think normal bakeware
can be made so much better
in both form and function.
And based upon
our current success,
we're just the company
that can get it done.
CORCORAN: Do you have a patent
on the design?
We do.
We have a utility patent
on the edge-pan design.
Everybody in the industry
said, "This is dumb.
It'll never work.
It's too new."
But we stuck with it,
and as soon as
we started making money,
people
followed the money trail.
Matt,
how successful are you?
Since we began selling
in 2006,
we've done $5.8 million
worth of sales.
You got to be kidding.
Really?
O'LEARY:
How -- How much this year?
HERJAVEC: Wow.
How much this year?
In 2012, we did
about $256,000 of sales.
So, what happened?
CUBAN: Something slowed down.
Where'd it go way up, and then
when did it go way down?
At the peak, we did
$1.7 million worth in a year.
O'LEARY: Whoa.
Wow.
$1.7 million
versus $256,000?
But $1 million of that
was in 30 days.
How?
Oprah.
Oprah.
Favorite things list.
Wow.
O'LEARY:
So, she blessed you
and she cursed you
at the same time...
Right.
...'Cause your comparables will
never, ever be the same again.
Right.
That's correct.
And now you're paying for it.
You took that money
and put it in the bank, right?
Oh, yeah.
I mean,
the money was great,
and we paid off
all of our debts.
I know
you've been on QVC, right?
Or you never were?
No.
Was that a competitor?
That was
an infringement,
and it's no longer sold
on QVC.
Okay, so, your infringers,
you've taken care of.
There is no infringing product
on the market.
We've swatted
all of those down.
Matt, you're not here
because of the pan.
By your own admission,
that's a flatline sale.
So, how are you gonna get back
To $1.5 million in sales?
Here's how
we're gonna do it.
We call this
our better muffin pan.
We applied kind of
our design sense
and our high quality
to a muffin pan,
and this is
what comes out.
Circles don't nest
like soldiers.
In nature, they nest
like a honeycomb.
So we nested them
like a honeycomb.
You know what that does?
No.
It saves us some metal.
There's not these extra, little
table tops between the cups,
because they're
nested closer.
What it also does,
when you're filling
this thing up --
There's no place really
to spill.
It goes
in the muffin cups.
Matt, is it cheaper
than a normal muffin pan?
This is not cheaper.
This is a $35.95 product,
just like our brownie pan.
Is it easier to clean
than a normal muffin pan?
It's super-easy to clean.
That's another key.
It's one piece, no rivets
and welds, rounded corners.
So, going forward, though,
your baseline business
is $256,000 a year.
Right.
That's poo-poo.
Relative, yeah.
Okay, so why is it worth
2 million bucks?
It's worth $2 million
because we have a patent
that protects us.
We also have
a foot in the door
in an industry that has
no new entrants for years.
This is a teensy, weensy,
cockroach-baseball-league
industry.
It's a $6-billion-a-year
industry...
EMILY: It's a $6 bill--
...for bakeware.
GREINER:
You guys, this pan --
They created a pan
that truly was revolutionary.
HERJAVEC:
No, no, but, Lori...
Seven years ago.
Every single person that had
a store that sold bakeware...
Seven years ago.
...Carried your pan.
Guys, look.
You did something great
seven years ago.
It had to be obvious to you,
when the whole thing sank,
you had to be going,
"I got to do something.
I got to do something."
And then,
three years later,
you come up with
the muffin-top super pan?
Yeah, well --
What the hell
were you doing?
I'm out.
What time is selling time,
Mark?
It's always selling time.
For two years,
you've been flatlining.
I'm not taking anything away
from what you created,
but I like
to get into business with people
that have a sense
of paranoia.
In my world,
only the paranoid survive.
You are very comfortable.
I'm out.
I would disagree
with that
in terms of being paranoid
or being comfortable.
You've got to understand,
you know, we have a family
and three kids.
At the time, we had two kids.
One was a newborn.
We had 5,000 pans
in our basement.
My parents came over.
My sister came over.
We packed pans
UNTIL 4:00 in the morning.
I had a baby getting up
every two hours,
and we're packing pans
and running orders on laptops.
We've been doing this hard-core
for years.
O'LEARY: We've -- We've heard
the story of the past.
For me,
that's completely irrelevant.
I don't care about the past.
If I'm gonna put up dollars
and invest in baker's edge,
I want to know
what the future holds.
That does not feel, to me,
like it's going to change
the world for muffins.
I want to know how
I'm gonna make a lot
of money selling this.
Apparently, it's burned out.
Everybody's got one
that wants one.
That's the story of your deal.
You don't have a new idea.
Uh --
I'm sorry.
I am out.
GREINER: You know,
it's easy for them all to say
when they've never
created a product.
[ chuckles ]
Okay?
It's extremely hard
to come up with something
as revolutionary
as what you did...
It's all in the past.
...For the retails.
It's all in the past.
Listen, listen.
It doesn't matter.
What they did was great.
You know, Margaret Mitchell
wrote one novel,
but it was
"Gone With the Wind."
Does she need
to write more?
Does she still
get royalties on it?
You did something fantastic
here in creating that,
and I admire you both
because I think
that that was genius.
So, the problem is
that you do have to keep trying
to come out with more
if you're trying
to sustain a business.
I don't feel
that this is the wave.
What you're holding in your hand
doesn't strike me
to have that same uniqueness
as what the brownie pan did.
Right.
So, for that reason,
I'm going out.
CORCORAN: I want to give you
a little bit of advice.
Don't put a lot of time
into this product.
You can't afford to take
the wrong product out right now.
This is the sophomore year
in your business,
when you've got to really
get good at what you're doing
and be really careful.
And I don't think
that's careful enough.
So, I don't have
the confidence.
I sure as heck wouldn't feel
comfortable with my money in it.
So I am out.
Re-reluctantly, I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks, you guys.
Appreciate it.
Good luck, guys.
Good luck, guys.
We appreciate the advice.
Thank you.
They really got fixed on
sort of a sales plateau
that we're experiencing,
and -- and they took that
as bad weather on the horizon.
They're savvy,
I respect their opinions,
but I feel like we've
still got a long way to
go with our products.
