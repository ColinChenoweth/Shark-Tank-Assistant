and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas MavEricks.
First into the tank is a mom
from Highland Park, Illinois,
with a product to make kids
feel more safe and secure.
I'm Nathan Jones.
I'm Erick Jansen.
And we're both firefighters
from Austin, Texas.
Go, go, go!
(Siren wailing)
We met eight years ago
on the job,
and we've been great friends
ever since.
Ready? Go. Careful.
We love spending time
outdoors with our kids.
Aah!
Aah!
We wanna take 'em
everywhere,
but they can't always
keep up.
Daddy!
Oh, goodness.
So we decided
to invent something
that would help us out.
Aah!
(Whirring)
After breaking
several sewing machines
and testing
countless prototypes,
we finally had our product.
Okay, man. That's perfect.
That's the one, right?
When we're not
putting out fires,
we devote all of our time
to product development
and sales.
We've both invested over $20,000
of our own personal money
to make this thing happen.
We need the sharks' help
to take our product
to its full potential.
If the sharks have a heart
in kids,
they will absolutely love
our product.
Hello. I'm Erick.
And my name's Nathan.
This is my son river.
Our company is the freeloader,
and we're seeking $200,000
for a 15% equity stake.
We all know kids
are full of energy,
but sooner or later,
they hit the wall.
A few years ago, I traveled
the streets of Paris
with my then
5-year-old daughter.
Knowing full well
her limitations,
we knew we had to plan
our outings accordingly
to avoid the dreaded meltdown.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, who wants to miss out
on seeing the eiffel tower
just because your kids
get tired of walking, right?
And as any parent knows,
you're gonna end up
carrying your kids
whether you want to or not.
And every time I did,
my arms were on fire.
I would start sweating.
My legs felt like lead.
Man, this was work.
So Erick gets back,
and we start talking.
Surely there has to be
a better way to carry our kids
than what the market
currently has to offer.
What if we made something
that was a lighter weight?
Something that was
more comfortable?
Something that felt like
it wasn't even there?
Sounds impossible, right?
This is what we created.
The freeloader.
Ha!
So the freeloader is...
Wow.
An ultra-sleek child carrier
that has an integrated frame
and a fold-down seat
that can hold up to 80 pounds.
(Click)
It has
a 5-point safety harness
to keep
the little buckaroo in.
(Laughter)
That is so cool.
And it uses current
hiking pack technologies
that evenly and effectively
distribute the weight
across your shoulders and hips
for extended outings.
The freeloader makes
everyday life easier.
From running errands
like going to the grocery store
to going
on amusement park adventures,
or even if your kid
just needs a quick recharge.
We're on the path
to a great new adventure here.
Who wants to hop on
and join us for the ride?
Can--can I try it? Do you mind?
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Can I try it with River
on the back?
Yeah.
I just wanna see
how heavy it is.
Absolutely.
That looks unbelievable.
Is that something that a woman
can carry and hold?
I mean...
Yes. My wife is
the biggest proponent of this.
We have a 3 and a 5-year-old.
(Robert)
Yeah. Do you mind, River?
River, smack him in the head
a few times, please.
(Laughter)
(Robert)
See, Mr. Cuban would do that.
He's not very nice.
All right. There you go.
Hop on, river.
Okay. Let's put you in the...
Whoa.
Let's hear it. "Mush, mush!"
Can I stand up?
"Mush."
Wow.
So he is now buckled in.
Oh, you're so cute.
(Robert)
Safe and secure in there?
(Kevin) Wow.
That's our number one priority.
We know a thing or two
about safety.
Yeah? Gimme five. All right.
(Chuckles)
Wow.
Great idea.
Robert,
are you comfortable?
I don't know if I could do it
all day, but--
Does it hurt your back?
Yeah, you feel the pressure,
but I think for carrying a kid,
as a dad,
your other options--
you always go
for the shoulders.
It's shoulders.
The shoulders work.
The piggyback won't ever work.
All right, Erick,
you've convinced me
it's a fantastic idea.
Are you selling it today?
We started a crowdfunding
campaign back in February,
ran it for 45 days,
and raised over $40,000.
Okay.
How did you get involved
in this?
Are you schoolteachers
or something?
Well, we know a thing or two
about carrying people.
We're both firefighters
out of Austin, Texas.
Oh, there you go. All right.
You are? Yay.
I wanted to ask you
about the product itself.
It seems heavy.
I don't think Barb or I
would be able to carry that.
You're used to carrying tanks
on your back.
Sure, sure. Absolutely. Mm-hmm.
So it's something
you're used to.
But if you did
do an injection mold,
it could be minimal weight.
I mean, the possibilities
are endless--titanium,
but then your costs--
carbon fiber.
You have to be realistic what
your costs are at that point.
With the weight, keep in mind,
that's 5 1/2 pounds.
This over here--
the current child carriers
weigh 7 1/2 pounds
and upwards.
(Robert) Nathan, what do you
need the money for today?
$200,000.
You're asking for 15%.
$110,000 would go to making
2,000 units,
and we'd use $90,000
for operating expenses
such as going to
the trade shows.
(Lori) Are you familiar with
all the rules and regulations...
We are.
For child safety?
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yes.
Have you been doing testing
for that
with an independent lab?
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
They're firemen, Lori.
Of course.
Okay.
When I look at it,
the first thing I think--I've
got a 4-year-old son named Jake.
And Jake has finally learned
from his car seat
how to undo these, right?
He's gonna unbuckle it,
he's gonna smack me in the head,
he's gonna punch me,
and then he's gonna
unbuckle and fall over.
(Kevin) I don't know. He's
facing your back. How's he--
no, no, no. Trust me.
If he's riding,
he's smacking, he's unbuckling,
and he's climbing.
(Chuckling)
Kevin, it's Mark's children.
You can only imagine.
Right.
I mean--I mean, if you have
a little boy, then you--
then you know.
Yes, I-I do.
Um, he's not able
to unbuckle those, specifically.
Trust me, it's the same
as his car seat.
And what I'm saying
about this is
you shouldn't be using
this money for 2,000 units.
You should use that
for your testing.
Because the worst possible
scenario
is for you to take
$200,000,
invest $110,000 in inventory,
get them out there,
and realize you've got a problem
and you have to take them back.
I-I think that Mark,
shockingly, is right about this.
I don't know if you want
to dump money
into buying 2,000 units.
I think it's a great product.
I think you can continue
to test the market.
How open are you to that?
We're incredibly open to it.
You all are the experts.
You have the resources,
the connections.
Look, guys, you're not even
a product yet, right?
You're--you're
a proof of concept.
You--you're too early
for me to get involved.
I mean, I love what you're
doing, I'll be a customer,
but you've got to take it
further.
You know, like they say, you
gotta crawl before you ball,
and you guys aren't even
crawling yet, right?
And so for that reason,
I'm out.
(Barbara) Here are
my two concerns.
I think this product needs
to be demonstrated to sell.
I see this on a store counter,
and it looks like every other
black thing out there
that you strap on
to your body.
And I'm concerned as to how
it's gonna sell on its own
without the demonstration aspect
of it,
and I think
that's a real liability.
And you know what?
(Chuckles) Most importantly,
I don't think parents want
to carry heavy kids.
I think that window
is so small.
They don't want to,
but we end up doing it.
(Barbara) They don't want to.
Yeah, if you go on a trip.
I agree with you.
But you have to, Barbara.
But day to day?
No, a 7-year-old?
Forget about it.
There's not a dad in America
who hasn't got the look
from the mom.
But you're gonna bring this
with you the whole day
because of one time?
Yes.
I think the window's too small,
so I'm out.
Just to speak to
the market research and testing,
we wear this to a kite festival
in Austin
with over 100,000 people,
and you will get mobbed
by everybody.
We spent two hours there.
We handed out cards.
In the following 24 hours,
we sold over $3,000
worth of units.
(Lori) It's like umbrellas
when it's raining, you know?
Exactly.
Everybody needs one.
Right.
So you should just
stand at fairs
with that on your back
and have them to sell.
Seriously.
And every parent will come up
and buy one.
And you're right. And that's
when the magic happens,
when people get to see it
and touch it and feel it.
Mm-hmm.
But that's where we are
gonna rely on
the skills
of dedicated sales staff,
people that are
well-versed in it.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not ready
for that yet.
I would love to help you,
because I love firemen.
You risk your lives every day
to save others.
My problem with the product,
though--
I'm worried about
the safety issues with it.
I think this is really clever,
but I'm not sure
if you're gonna have issues
with either passing
safety testing
or liability from consumers.
For those reasons, I'm out.
I'm past all
the manufacturing issues.
I'm gonna make the assumption
within the next year
you'll optimize for weight
and design.
I'm in a different place.
Even if it's perfect today,
I have no idea
what it's going to cost
to actually scale it
and start selling it,
because I don't know
what my customer
acquisition costs are.
Even baby products--
and I used to be in a business
that sold products for children
between the ages of 3 and 5--
we spent hundreds
of millions of dollars
trying to capture the mothers.
It was really expensive.
It never got easier.
And that's a hard road.
I'm out.
I've made a lot of money
by trusting my gut.
My first sense,
when I saw River get on it,
I said,
this is a great product.
And as people started
talking about
all the objections,
all the negatives,
I became less excited.
My best friend Rob
is a fireman,
and so he taught me,
when you go into a fire,
the very first rule is
stay calm.
The second rule is
assess the situation.
I don't think you've assessed
this situation enough.
I think the design needs to be
a little bit better,
the weight--all those issues.
So I don't think this is
a company today.
I think it's a journey.
But I want to go down
that journey with you.
But I see it as a partnership.
$200,000 for one-third.
Um... okay.
You mind if we take
one minute?
If you want to run that risk,
go ahead.
There's a fire!
Yeah.
The fire is burning,
and you're gonna take a minute?
No, we don't. You know what?
We would love to work with you.
Absolutely.
Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations, guys.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you so much.
I think it's a great product.
Yeah. Nice to meet you guys.
Thank you so much.
Yeah. Thanks for being
fire guys.
Thank you.
And thank y'all for your time.
But you know what, guys?
It's funny. The other sharks
almost talked me out of it,
'cause they brought up
all these problems,
and I just went back
to the very first reaction.
And I think dads are gonna
have that reaction.
As soon as they see it,
they're gonna get psyched.
Dads'll get it in a heartbeat.
It's easy to get.
Congrats, guys.
Thank you.
Thanks you guys so much.
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
We couldn't have asked
for a better partnership
with Robert. We really
feel like he gets it.
Um, he's gonna be great
in helping us
navigate the waters and to
get us where we need to be.
Yeah.
