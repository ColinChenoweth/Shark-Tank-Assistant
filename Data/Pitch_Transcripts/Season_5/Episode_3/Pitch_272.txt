Hello, sharks, my name
is Chris Johnson...
Oh, my God.
(Chris) It doesn't come with
noodles. It's just a cooker.
Chris, is that all you?
Every single, uh, retailer
Chris, this product's gonna last
about two years, maybe three.
What equity are you taking?
Zero equity.
I don't want any equity.
That is a real offer,
Chris, I tasted this,
fully expecting it to be mushy,
because I have tried
to save three minutes
on many occasions in
sticking it in the microwave,
Chris, I love the story
how you got here.
I love the fact you did it
on your own.
A guy offered to buy my company
for $5 million.
I thought it was all the money
in the world.
I came home. I told my wife
I'm taking the offer.
Chris,
my only issue with this is
I can't get over the value
of the business today--
Chris, I wanna be in business
with you.
Here's what I'm comfortable
with today.
I'll give you the $300,000
for 40%.
Wow.
That's giving you
a pretty good value
but Chris has two offers--
$300,000 for a royalty
of $1.10 per unit,
which drops to 50 cents
once the investment
is paid back to Kevin.
Okay, but, Chris,
I look at the risks.
I want my capital back sooner
than you wanna give it to me.
So I'm putting a mechanism
in place,
Yes or no, Chris?
This is your moment. Yes or no?
I can't accept that offer
at 25%.
Chris, I'll give you
the $300,000
that you're looking for.
I thought you were out.
Nope.
I'm gonna do it
a little bit differently.
I'm gonna be creative,
unlike some of these guys.
$150,000 for 20% of your company
for the equity,
Chris, the beauty of the deal
with royalty--
it's just a different form
of interest.
Completely different.
You know we're
highly motivated
to give you more money.
You only pay it on the success
of sales.
Completely--
no, here's where--Chris.
You have debt.
You owe this guy $150,000.
That is forever
until you pay it back,
Look, Chris,
we gotta make a decision.
Uh... Mark, if you could do
the $150,000 loan,
