My name's Chris Johnson,
and I'm here...
(Excited voice) Boom!
Hello, sharks, my name
is Chris Johnson...
Oh, my God.
Wow!
And I'm the creator
of the rapid ramen cooker,
the world's fastest,
easiest, and healthiest way
to make ramen noodles
in the microwave.
I'm here seeking an investment
of $300,000
for a 10% equity stake
in my company.
Now, many of you
are familiar with these--
ramen noodles.
They're an undisputed
college staple,
and the annual consumption
of these packets
is 95 billion worldwide.
However, surprisingly,
these things don't have
microwaving instructions,
requiring you to make it on
the stove, which is a hassle.
That's why I created
the rapid ramen cooker.
The rapid ramen cooker
is a square-shaped bowl
in the same exact dimensions
of a block of ramen noodles.
All you do is you take
the ramen noodles,
put it inside the cooker,
add water to the water line,
pop it in the microwave
for three to four minutes,
and it makes perfect ramen
every single time.
So here, I got some
cooked ramen right here.
Look how perfect
the ramen is.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Stovetop quality
in less than half the time.
My goal is to put
rapid ramen cookers
in the hands
of every single consumer
of ramen noodles worldwide,
and I'm looking for sharks
to join me in that mission.
I'm gonna give you guys
some, uh, ramen cookers
so you can try it out.
You're not gonna give us
the noodles to go with it?
Absolutely.
I'm gonna bring some noodles
to you as well.
Thank God.
I don't have a microwave
here, though.
There you go. (Laughs)
Thank you.
It doesn't come with noodles?
(Chris) It doesn't come with
noodles. It's just a cooker.
And so you can see how
beautifully cooked...
Let me taste that guy.
I'm hungry.
Those ramen noodles are.
Why not just do it,
I mean, the old-fashioned way?
Take a cup,
put some water in it,
you stick it in the microwave,
your pour the noodles in,
you eat it, you go to sleep,
you wake up, recover
from your hangover.
(Laughs)
I've been making it
in the microwave all my life.
Put you never get
the stovetop quality taste.
Sometimes--
you're drunk.
It doesn't matter.
It does.
It does matter.
Other bowls just heat
excess water.
And they're not specifically
designed to cook ramen noodles.
Help me out here.
You got a $300,000 ask,
and I get 10%
of the rapid ramen cooker.
So computed value's
3 million bucks.
Correct.
Now before I put you
in the microwave...
(Laughs)
Explain to me
why that makes sense.
Tell me about your sales
and how much cash you've made.
Absolutely.
In the last three months,
I've done over $164,000
in sales.
Wow.
How much do you sell
the rapid ramen cooker for?
Uh, it retails for $5.99.
(Kevin) Okay, and how much
does it cost to make?
About 75 cents.
And it's all online?
You don't have any retailers
selling this?
Absolutely incorrect.
We went from zero stores
to over 2,500 stores
in the last three months.
Who are the stores?
We are in Raley's,
Albertsons, Safeway,
Winco, H-E-B in Texas.
(Robert) How did you get into
all those stores?
Grinding, man. I just
pick up the phone and call.
Good for you.
I love that.
Chris, is that all you?
Every single, uh, retailer
that I've, uh, landed
was all me.
If this keeps going, why can't
somebody just knock this off?
It's patent pending.
What's patented?
It's the reservoir design
of a container that cooks
ramen noodles.
You seem very bright
and very enterprising to me.
I'd like to hear
about your background.
Well, I've been an entrepreneur
since I was 16 years old.
At 16, there was nothing
to do for teenagers,
so I created dance parties.
Charging 10 bucks a head,
I was making $4,000
in just one event.
At 19 years old,
I had
my own modeling agency.
When I got out of college,
I started
my own staffing company.
Uh, with zero revenue,
did over a million dollars
in less than 14 months.
What happened to that business?
That business
is still rolling.
Do you own it?
I still own 100%
of that business.
You still running it?
Well, what I did is
I hired my long-term employee,
uh, to run the day-to-day
operations of that company,
and I've been focusing 100%
on rapid ramen.
To me, that suggests
that all you've done
is jump from
quickie business
to quickie business
to quickie business,
because either you lose interest
or you can't run the business.
Absolutely not, Mark.
With the staffing company,
when we hit this recession,
uh, it was the biggest hit
my--I've ever experienced
in my life.
Fair enough.
Look, I feel your pain, right?
Everybody got hit.
Continued to happen.
Uh, staffing company
has not recovered.
But what I understood is that I
could not part-time this thing.
I had
a huge opportunity here,
so I put all my focus
on rapid ramen.
What's your sales
in the last month?
About $80,000.
And what percentage of that
was through retailers?
About 80% is retail.
My projections
with just safeway alone--
you know,
just selling one a day.
Right now in winco,
we're selling three a day,
21 units a week.
You are?
What does that look like
for the whole year?
For the whole year,
we're--we're expected
to do over $2 million
this year.
Okay, so something's
not adding up here.
It doesn't compute.
Yeah, I'm having a problem, too.
If you're doing $80,000 a month
with huge margins,
you should be generating,
you know,
very quickly $300,000
in cash flow
to reinvest in the business.
Right now I have over $150,000
in receivables.
But I look
at our bank account.
It's--we're just
turning through the pro--
through our inventory.
So you need capital
for inventory.
We need capital
for inventory.
You need $300,000 right now?
Based on our projection,
we may even need
a little more than that,
but I-I take it off
the $300,000
because I do have receivables
coming in.
So your expectation is
if I give you $300,000 today
and you need another million
tomorrow, I'm gonna fund that?
I hope you have the wherewithal
to do that.
I think what happens here is
you wanna run with this thing,
sell as many as you can
till you burn it out.
That's basically it.
Well, that's not--
because there
will be competitors
that come in at a lower price
and squeeze that margin
down to pennies.
There's nothing proprietary
about this.
I understand you have a patent,
but a small modification
will do the same thing.
You understand that.
Which leads to the question,
how did you get
to your valuation?
We're gonna do $2 million
this year.
You hope.
Yeah, it's hard to see--
I don't hope, mark.
(Kevin) Well,
of course he hopes.
I'm--I'm--yeah.
You hope, just like when
you had your staffing business.
I'm sure things were great,
and you projected out
a whole lot more.
Just like when you had
your model business.
What you're really saying is
your business is worth
$3 million
on what, $200,000 in sales?
Well, I'll tell you this.
If I were offered $3 million
today to sell the company,
I wouldn't sell it,
based on the growth
that we're having.
If someone offered you
$3 million today,
you wouldn't take it?
I wouldn't take it, Mark.
Un-un-undeniably,
I wouldn't take it.
You're a fool.
You're a fool.
I wish I had the courage.
Mark, I--
you're a fool. I'm out.
I don't know
if I like your plan
to burn up all my cash
in inventory.
'Cause one day, what happens
to products like this is,
they stop selling.
And whatever's sitting
in the warehouse,
you own it,
and you gotta eat it.
If you're gonna stay
on your path,
you need a big wallet.
Happen to have one.
(Chuckles)
All right?
So here's an offer
I'll make for you, okay?
I think it may be
the only offer you get.
I will give you your $300,000.
I want $1.10...
Ha!
Every time you sell one
until I get my cash back,
because I don't know
how long it's gonna take you
to sell 300,000 units.
And after I get my cash back,
I get 50 cents in perpetuity.
Chris, this product's gonna last
about two years, maybe three.
What equity are you taking?
Zero equity.
I don't want any equity.
That is a real offer,
and I think that actually
encapsulates the risk
I've got here.
I need to get
this capital back
before this little fad ends,
my friend. That's--
I'll tell you, I think
even for you, back when
you were eating in college,
they ate ramen noodles,
and so--
hey, I ate ramen noodles.
I get it.
Yeah.
But I didn't need to spend
5 bucks to get this bowl.
I figured it out on my own.
Well, I think
that you are fantastic.
I personally am concerned about
somebody else trying to do this.
That's one of my worries
for you.
So I'm not going to
personally invest.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
I--thank--
I appreciate you.
Chris, I tasted this,
fully expecting it to be mushy,
because I have tried
to save three minutes
on many occasions in
sticking it in the microwave,
and it doesn't work.
This tastes exactly the same
as if I cooked it on the stove.
But I'm not totally sold this is
gonna make you a ton of money.
It's a onetime sale.
I feel badly saying "no" to you
because I like you a lot.
I feel like Lori, for God sakes.
"I like you a lot."
(Laughs)
But I'm out.
Chris, I love the story
how you got here.
I love the fact you did it
on your own.
A guy offered to buy my company
for $5 million.
I thought it was all the money
in the world.
I came home. I told my wife
I'm taking the offer.
I had the papers,
and my wife said, "why?
You don't believe in yourself
enough?"
I turned the offer down
because my wife believed in me
more than I believed in myself.
I'm gonna start crying.
And a few years later,
I sold it for $100 million.
Chris,
my only issue with this is
I can't get over the value
of the business today--
Robert, are we gonna hold hands
and sing "Kumbaya" here?
$300,000. The business
is not worth $3 million.
Shut up, Kevin.
What is this?
The business is not worth
$3 million today.
Help me get there.
? Kumbaya ?
Oh, stop it.
? Kumbaya ?
Kevin, give the guy
a break.
This is business!
Get to it!
I know. Take it seriously here.
This is business.
This is the guy's life.
This is his life.
Give him a chance.
Every store that I've contacted,
I've been able to get in,
and they're selling,
and they're moving product.
Chris, I wanna be in business
with you.
Here's what I'm comfortable
with today.
I'll give you the $300,000
for 40%.
Wow.
That's giving you
a pretty good value
for a new company, and really,
I'm taking you at your word
because I think you're gonna
make it happen.
So you have two offers now.
You've succeeded where many
other people have not
in "Shark Tank."
What are you going to do?
but Chris has two offers--
$300,000 for a royalty
of $1.10 per unit,
which drops to 50 cents
once the investment
is paid back to Kevin.
And $300,000 for 40% equity
from Robert.
So you have two offers now.
Uh, if you don't mind, I'd like
to make a call and, uh--
you understand the nuances
of both offers?
Yeah, yours is to basically
hook me around the throat,
and--and...
(Laughter)
So I'm very clear
about that.
I've been around a long time,
my friend.
I've seen these fads
come and go, and I'm not saying
this will go soon,
but I don't know.
So I'm reflecting it
in the offer.
He's taking out
his risk screening in the--
in the form of 40%
of your company.
If you succeed,
that's a whole lot.
So have some respect for money.
Well, no,
and I-I-I appreciate it.
I've done it my way.
Robert's done it his way.
Now go make a decision.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
I think you're asking
for too much.
We gotta get some cash
along the way.
Come into my deal, and I'll drop
the royalty in perpetuity
down to 40 cents,
but I'm keeping it a buck 10.
I like the fact you're
getting cash along the way.
Yes.
Uh, Mr. wonderful offered me
a deal that wasn't so wonderful.
(Chuckles)
Uh, as far as a royalty that
exceeds the cost of the product,
uh, but no equity.
And then, um, Robert offered me
40% of the company,
which just is outrageous.
Kevin, let's lower
the dollar amount per product
and lower the equity.
Okay, we're gonna drop it down
to 70 cents?
Let's take it to 25% equity
and lower it to 75 cents.
Okay, and what's
the perpetual royalty?
Is that gonna be--
there's no perpetual royalty?
Well, that's the equity.
Right. No, no--
the equity--
you want the equity
and you want the royalty.
Yeah. I think
there's a lesson.
Leaving the tank
lets the water swirl.
Okay, but, Chris,
I look at the risks.
I want my capital back sooner
than you wanna give it to me.
So I'm putting a mechanism
in place,
and Robert and I both agree.
I wasn't hot on the equity.
He is.
So we've married
these two offers together
to reflect both
of our interests
and provide you
with the capital you need.
Yes or no, Chris?
This is your moment. Yes or no?
I can't accept that offer
at 25%.
Chris, I'll give you
the $300,000
that you're looking for.
I thought you were out.
Nope.
I'm gonna do it
a little bit differently.
I'm gonna be creative,
unlike some of these guys.
$150,000 for 20% of your company
for the equity,
and I'm gonna give you
$150,000 loan.
And I'm gonna price it
the same I do
for growth loans for all
my "Shark Tank" companies.
Right? Which is
significantly less--
you know what?
The offers are
practically identical.
No, they're not.
Because you're paying back
the debt
that we're providing you
in a different way.
Chris, the beauty of the deal
with royalty--
it's just a different form
of interest.
Completely different.
You know we're
highly motivated
to give you more money.
Completely different.
And you have no debt.
You only pay it on the success
of sales.
Completely--
no, here's where--Chris.
You have debt.
You owe this guy $150,000.
That is forever
until you pay it back,
and if it doesn't work out,
he owns the rapid ramen cooker.
That's the evil of debt.
But the difference--
the difference is if
your growth is explosive,
like you think
it's going to be,
that royalty becomes much more
expensive than the debt.
Look, Chris,
we gotta make a decision.
Uh... Mark, if you could do
the $150,000 loan,
and the $150,000,
uh, equity for 15%,
you have yourself a deal.
