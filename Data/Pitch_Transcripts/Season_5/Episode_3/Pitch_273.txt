My name is Debbie Glickman,
but then what happened--
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sees
a new Debbie every day...
Right. Right.
With another product.
The only Debbies that get
to stay in sell product.
Yours didn't.
They threw you out.
Here's the truth.
You don't have a business.
You have a hobby.
That's it. Take the rest
of the inventory.
Put it under the bed.
Let the monster eat it,
Debbie, I-I think you're
driving meshugge. Honestly.
I don't think you have
a firm grasp
on all the different pieces.
You know, I have to jump in.
I don't agree with Mark.
Debbie, I don't think
you have a firm grasp
on all the different pieces.
I have to jump in.
I don't agree with Mark.
I think that this is
very creative.
I think kids probably love it.
I love your creativity
about this product.
Nobody's gonna buy this.
Apparently nobody has bought it.
I think it may need some help.
She's--she said herself,
she's not good at sales.
Some of the monsters
you sprayed four years ago
Debbie, have you called Disney?
In the U.S.
Not yet.
(Laughter)
But I'm gonna.
I-I need someone to help
guide me through that end of it.
You know what I'm--
do you know what I'm saying?
(Robert) Oh, come on, Debbie.
Right.
You've got it
into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
so don't tell me you couldn't
pick up the phone
a goal--Debbie, a goal
is great to have.
Right.
But you gotta have a timeline.
A goal without a timeline
is simply a dream.
Right.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Mark?
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.
Listen, here's the thing.
I will do anything
in my power
to make this business grow.
Look, most entrepreneurs,
when their back
is up against the wall
thank you guys so much
for your time. Thank you.
(Mark) Good luck, Debbie.
(Lori) Good luck.
Thanks.
I believe in my company.
I believe in everything
that it does to help kids,
