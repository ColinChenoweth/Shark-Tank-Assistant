My name is Debbie Glickman,
and my company
is Fairytale Wishes.
I am asking for
a $35,000 investment
in exchange for 33%
of my company.
When my son
was a little boy,
he was scared to go to sleep
at night.
So I ended up buying
a teeny-weeny bottle
of $25 lavender pillow spray,
and I told my son
it was a magic potion
that would give him
sweet dreams,
and he bought it,
and he went right to sleep.
And I thought to myself,
you know what?
There's an idea there.
Fairytale Wishes is a line
of magic aromatherapy sprays
to help empower children
through the use of yummy scents
and their imagination.
A couple of sprays of
our signature lavender-scented
sweet dreams spray
on your child's pillow...
(Spritzes)
Will assure your child
sweet dreams
are on the way.
And if your kids have
monsters under the bed...
(Growl)
(Laughter)
Our bubblegum-scented
monster repellent
will keep the monsters
far, far away,
because in case
you didn't know it,
monsters are terrified
of the smell of bubblegum.
(Laughter)
I have some sample pillows
for you.
A pillow for everybody.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, my favorite.
Cotton candy scent.
Thank you, Debbie.
Grape jelly scent. (Laughs)
Grape jelly.
(Robert)
Wow, it smells really good.
They smell good.
Thank you.
I mean, that really smells
like bubblegum, grape jelly.
What does it cost--what does
it cost you to make this?
It costs $2.16 to make.
To make it?
Yeah.
Why is it so expensive?
Because--well, 'cause I make it
here in the United States, and--
and what do you sell them for?
The 4-ounce bottle
has been selling for $9.99.
How many have you sold
over what period of time?
We have been in business
for four years, and last year,
our sales were $5,500.
$5,500?
That is nothing.
What I've learned is that
P.R. is really our key,
because when we see P.R.--
you know what?
I'm just telling you...
Uh-huh?
To me, that is the ultimate
red--red flag.
When somebody thinks
it's all about P.R.,
"if I only got
on one more TV show,"
"if I only got
in one more magazine"--
you're always looking for
a-a shortcut.
Well, I'll tell you what.
We did a 6-store test
with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
and in one month,
they reordered three times.
It was during the holidays.
They had it up
in the front of the store.
The minute they put it
in the back of the store,
sales tanked.
Welcome to the real world.
If they didn't reorder,
it's because it didn't make
enough money per linear foot
for them to care about it.
They put another product
in there that sold much better.
Well, they--when they moved it
to the back of the store--
but then what happened--
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sees
a new Debbie every day...
Right. Right.
With another product.
The only Debbies that get
to stay in sell product.
Yours didn't.
They threw you out.
Here's the truth.
You don't have a business.
You have a hobby.
That's it. Take the rest
of the inventory.
Put it under the bed.
Let the monster eat it,
and forget about this one.
(Laughs)
You know what?
In all due fairness...
That was rude.
Thank you.
I have never, ever gotten
anything
but wonderful, positive
feedback.
No, but that's not true.
Do you know why? Because
the best feedback in the world,
the only feedback
you could trust is sales.
Listen, I'm great at all
the creative stuff,
and I'm not so great
at the business end,
and that's why I came here
to find a partner
to help me
with the business end.
Debbie, I-I think you're
driving meshugge. Honestly.
I don't think you have
a firm grasp
on all the different pieces.
You know, I have to jump in.
I don't agree with Mark.
Debbie, I don't think
you have a firm grasp
on all the different pieces.
I have to jump in.
I don't agree with Mark.
I think that this is
very creative.
I think kids probably love it.
I love your creativity
about this product.
Nobody's gonna buy this.
Apparently nobody has bought it.
I think it may need some help.
She's--she said herself,
she's not good at sales.
Some of the monsters
you sprayed four years ago
have died of old age, and you
still don't have any sales.
(Laughter)
You don't have a business.
I'm out.
Don't you have kids, Kevin?
Of course I do.
He eats his children.
Look, I just tell 'em,
if there's any monsters around,
I'll take care of it,
and they believe me.
(Laughs)
Thank you, Barbara.
It doesn't work on him.
I will tell you
what I think would help you.
Okay.
I don't think that
parents and families
need this big of a bottle.
I think if you made
a 5-pack...
Uh-huh.
Of small bottles,
then you have
your monster spray,
the lavender spray...
The small bottle..
Then you buy all 5
for like $7.99.
Are expensive to make.
And then a mother has
something...
They're expensive to make,
though. Right.
Well, you've gotta get
better sourcing.
Right.
But to me,
I just think
a different marketing strategy
might be more helpful.
Right, right.
I think having five flavors--
I don't think is
at all necessary.
You should have
one magic spray, period.
Decide what it is.
Call it "magic spray."
Yeah.
You could make a good product
of this. You're creative,
but you know what?
It's not selling.
So you gotta redo it
and figure out what to do
and I don't wanna take
that ride with you. I'm out.
Okay. Thank you so much.
Here's an idea. Here's an idea
that maybe you'll like.
So I came up with this idea
to partner with Disney, okay?
Disney has
25,000 hotel rooms...
Debbie, have you called Disney?
In the U.S.
Not yet.
(Laughter)
But I'm gonna.
I-I need someone to help
guide me through that end of it.
You know what I'm--
do you know what I'm saying?
(Robert) Oh, come on, Debbie.
Right.
You've got it
into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
so don't tell me you couldn't
pick up the phone
and call the other ones,
because you did it once.
Right. No, no, no.
I understand, so--
a goal--Debbie, a goal
is great to have.
Right.
But you gotta have a timeline.
A goal without a timeline
is simply a dream.
Right.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
Mark?
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.
Listen, here's the thing.
I will do anything
in my power
to make this business grow.
Look, most entrepreneurs,
when their back
is up against the wall
and their sales are falling,
that is all that
they can think about.
That consumes them.
That eats them,
and that's the way
you have to be.
You have to work
like there's somebody
trying to take it
all away from you,
because there probably is.
My suggestion is
get somebody else
to sell it for you,
because that is not
your strength.
You're not an entrepreneur.
You're a want-repreneur,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay, well, thank you.
I disagree with you, though.
Who's left?
Lori.
Well, I don't agree
with Mark or Barb
that you need
to go down to one bottle.
They're mistaken because they're
not retail people like I am.
I think your creativity
is fantastic. I love this.
I think it's super sweet.
The problem is, is you haven't
gone and really tried,
I don't think hard enough,
to make your dream come true.
I'm out.
Okay, well,
thank you guys so much
for your time. Thank you.
(Mark) Good luck, Debbie.
(Lori) Good luck.
Thanks.
I believe in my company.
I believe in everything
that it does to help kids,
and I'm not gonna stop.
I'm gonna keep goin'.
