(Chuckles)
I'm Juli, and this is
my best friend
and business partner, Ozma.
We are seeking $50,000
for a 20% equity
in our company.
Our product is
a never-seen-before,
revolutionary cooking
lifestyle convenience product.
One night, we were hosting
a dinner party
for our girlfriends.
The main dish was fish.
After dinner, the girls and I
hit the town
and headed to
a swanky L.A. lounge.
Someone approached me
and told me
my hair smelled like fish.
Ew!
I was mortified,
so I asked the bartender
for a second opinion,
and sure enough,
my luscious locks
did indeed smell like
our main dinner course.
We knew there had to be
a better solution
to this common
stinky problem.
(Both) So...
(Laughter)
We've created the Kookin' Kap.
(Robert, singsongy)
Da-dun!
(Ozma, singsong) Ta-da!
(Barbara) You gotta be kidding.
(Mark) Oh, my lord.
The Kookin' Kap is so easy
to use.
Just put it
right over your head...
Twirl your hair up.
No hair-tying needed.
And...
(Both) Voilà!
(Laughter)
(Both) And one size fits all!
Oh, God.
Wow.
The Kookin' Kap
is the modern version
of the traditional chef hat
that not only
keeps the smell of food
out of your hair...
(Both) It also keeps hair
out of your food!
(Juli) And it's chic
and comfortable.
(Laughs)
The Kookin' Kap saves
any blowout
and keeps your hair
smelling fresh
and looking like you just
styled it.
(Laughter)
(Robert) Whoo!
Hair smell like crap?
(Both) Get a cap!
(Kevin and Robert) Wow!
Let's have one
on Kevin here, please.
Yes! I think you'd look
pretty in pink.
Let me try the pink one.
I like the look.
He wants the pink one.
Yeah, I think you'd
look hot in pink.
You guys are fun.
Have you sold
any of these so far?
(Robert) Ah.
We have sold 1,729 hats.
Thank you, Ozma.
Uh-huh.
In what time period?
Just under one year.
Oh, you look great
in that cap.
Yeah, it feels good, too.
(Lori) Let's see, Kevin.
Yeah.
Juli, make him take that off.
Your sales are gonna go down.
Ah! We want them--
he looks like
little Bo peep.
It does look like
the camera's on him.
Okay, so you sold
a thousand--what was it?
1,729 caps.
At what price?
At anywhere between
$9.95 and $12.95.
Juli, what's the name
of the company? Kookin'--
Kookin' Kap.
It's called Kookin' Kaps.
Kookin' Kap.
Is it kookin' karps
or Kookin' Kap?
(Juli and Ozma)
Kookin' Kap.
(Juli) So in addition--
so why does it say "karp"?
It looks like it.
It doesn't--it's not an "r."
It says "Kap"!
(Kevin) It says "karp."
It's "p" for "Kap."
And what's your background?
Well, so...
We work for one of the largest
financial services companies
in the world.
Really?
(Juli and Ozma) Yes.
Doing what?
I actually work
at Ernst &amp; Young
as a manager
in our advisory practice.
I'm a campus recruiter
for our Los Angeles
and San Diego tax practice.
Should I be concerned
about the first thing
I read in the label?
It says, "Caution. Flammable."
Nonflammable.
No, it says "flammable"
right here.
(Robert scoffs)
It does.
It says "flammable."
(Gasps) No!
(Barbara) Yeah.
They must--
so you have mis-labeled,
that's all.
(Robert) That's not good.
That--
yeah, just like "kookin' karps."
(Robert laughing)
No, it's Kookin' Kap.
In addition to the--
(laughs)
Who does your spell-check?
So, Juli and Ozma, how are you
selling these? Online?
Yes. We're selling them online.
So right now,
we're selling them online,
direct to consumer.
And what do they cost you
to make?
They cost us $3.70.
$3.70.
I love you say everything
in unison!
And you're making them here?
(Juli and Ozma) Yeah.
Where do you make
big bucks in this?
I would say either
retail or on TV.
TV? Hang on?
I wish there was a shark
that worked on TV
all the time.
(Kevin) I--
(juli) Who loves to cook!
(Robert speaks indistinctly)
(Robert) Who could it be?
You know what, guys?
This is the perfect
QVC product.
Mark!
I hope Lori carries it.
I think so, too.
But that's not me.
I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, Mark.
(Lori) I'll tell you,
I have one problem with it.
And--
okay.
(Robert) What?
You're adorable,
but somebody could take
a shower cap
and put it on their head, too.
This is so much better.
And stop the smell.
And--
shower caps are
actually flammable,
when this is not,
even though it says--
even though this says it is?
But this is! It says so!
No, it's not, I promise.
And the shower cap is
actually not breathable.
So when--you actually will
get sweaty...
That's the better answer.
And your hair will get sweaty,
um, so it actually just is not--
this you could wear
for hours.
Yeah.
Like, you could cook an entire
dinner party and wear this,
and you'll take it off--
but--
I like that you're
inventing something...
But, juli--
but I don't think there's
an enormous need for this.
When I invest in a product,
I like something
that solves a problem,
and this is a problem,
but I think it's
a small problem.
Lori, it actually
solves two problems.
Not only does it keep
the smell of food
out of your hair, it also
keeps hair out of your food.
(Lori) Mnh.
Ahh!
So it's also
a contamination issue.
Here's the thing--I don't think
if I were making fish at home,
I don't think I'd be going out
dancing right afterwards
or something like that.
Really? Well,
even if you weren't,
you still wouldn't want
the fish to get--
the smell to get in your
hair for the next day.
But couldn't you take a shower?
You know, I've never really
thought about it.
Perhaps I have smelly hair.
I cook most nights.
I don't know. But...
(Chuckling) I just
can't picture... uh...
Uh... cooking with this
on my head.
(Laughs)
And by the way, I think
you two are adorable.
(Both) Thank you.
But it's not the product
for me. I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you
for your time.
Ladies, I think you're
two beautiful women,
but when you put the cap on...
(Barbara laughs)
You look like
80-year-old grandmas.
No!
So I'm not sure
I want to buy something
for my wife, or my wife
wants to buy something...
She's only gonna wear it
while she's cooking!
That's gonna make her look
like an 80-year-old grandma.
Only when she's cooking.
Ozma, I-I'm out.
Okay.
I love 80-year-old grandmas,
but I don't see
the real need for this.
I'm out.
I think it's ironic...
(Laughter)
That the only person
who is still in
has no hair.
All right,
let's talk numbers.
Yes.
Yeah, you know,
listen, ladies...
(Laughter)
The whole kookin' karp
thing is crazy.
I-I think you're cute,
but this is not a business,
it's a hobby.
Come on. Just ask for her
to give your money back.
Ladies, you're losing him.
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait. We can--
sweeten the offer!
Sweeten the offer!
We can sell anything.
(Lori) No, don't.
We can sell peanut butter
and jelly in a steakhouse.
We can sell Kookin' Kaps
to the masses.
Come on!
Oh, my goodness.
Mr. wonderful.
Absolutely not. I'm out.
(Laughter)
You guys keep thinking, though.
Congratulations, guys.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
That's awesome.
(Barbara) Pleasure.
Bye.
(Lori) Bye.
They brought a smile
to my face.
