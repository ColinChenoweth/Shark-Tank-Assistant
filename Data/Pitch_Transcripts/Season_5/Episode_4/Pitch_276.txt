is a love songs
  And dedications show
And he is
  one of the leading deejays
So looks like Daymond and I
  will take off
can't stop music,
  and they can't stop love.
  (laughs) No.
I live with my wife
  and five sons
even if it's on land.
This is Gus.
  He's my oldest son.
  How's it going?
Somebody has finally done it,
  and it was us.
Let me tell you how we did it.
and the bills get paid.
(Gus) man.
Thank you.
And if this is gonna take off,
a month and a half ago.
Pete, tell us,
  what do people buy?
(Pete) Wait.
  So...
(Gus) So...
ah.
  Oh, wow.
Cool.
Whoo!
and then we get
  to extend that--
You've got to tell me
  how you expand beyond that,
and you have a path
  to $20 million,
and all you need
  is my gasoline
So my angle is to go and do
  a lot of licenses
to build this up on
  people's existing machines.
Okay, guys, buy a belt,
  feed a family.
  (claps hands)
we give them the tools
  and the money they need
and my company is scan.
is still young and foolish
  enough to take a chance on us?
and I kept going at it,
and it kept falling off.
(laughs)
  Who makes the packaging?
  You guys make it all, and--
Yes. The packaging
  is 53 cents,
use, like, tape and stuff.
And that's what we need
  help with.
and I want to do this deal,
and you can go off
  and make it happen,
that's fine, but you need
  the knowledge--
the packaging, the back office--
  All that stuff,
and I wouldn't have the time
  to help you with that.
I'm out.
and my dad would take me
  to stamp shows.
He had no idea
  what was going on.
and the same $30,000.
I'm not gonna negotiate
  with them.
No?
  It's just a good deal
  as it is.
