This is the Shark Tank,
where hopeful entrepreneurs
  get a once-in-a-Lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks in hopes
  of getting an investment
to start, grow, or save
  their businesses.
(all)
  ? "Sunday night slow jams" ?
The entrepreneurs
  must convince a shark to invest
the full amount
  they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
  with nothing.
I'm here seeking $1 million
  for 5% of my company.
Not impressed.
  Not impressed.
If the sharks hear
  a great idea...
that is so cool.
  They're ready to invest,
using their own money.
This is radioactive waste
  out there. It sucks.
And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
Are you making an offer?
  Yes. $100,000 for 30%.
I want to be in this business.
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
  into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Daymond John is
  a fashion and branding expert
Who grew
  his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
  fashion brand fubu.
Robert herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his first
  internet companies
for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner,
  the queen of QVC,
holds over a hundred patents
and has launched
  over 300 products,
grossing over
  a half a billion dollars
in retail sales.
And Mark Cuban,
notorious billionaire
  entrepreneur, tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
  of the Nba's Dallas mavericks.
First into the tank
  is a radio deejay
from San Diego, California,
who's pitching the sharks
  his syndicated radio show.
Hi, sharks.
  My name is R Dub.
I'm the creator and host
  of "Sunday night slow Jams."
I'm seeking $75,000
  in exchange for 10% equity.
"Sunday night slow Jams"
heard across America
  and around the world
on over 60 radio stations.
We feature the ultimate mix
  of love songs from today
and the classics
  from back in the day,
but most importantly,
special coast-To-Coast
  listener dedications
that we call
  "Oral Expressions."
Ooh!
  "Oral ex--
  Oral expressions."
Okay.
  (Lori laughs)
Let me show you
  how it works.
All right, sharks, so picture
  this. It's Sunday night,
and we are live
  from coast to coast,
hundreds of thousands
  of dedicated
"Sunday night slow Jams"
  Listeners
are passionately glued
  to their radio,
including Mark,
  who's slow-Jammin' in Dallas.
Now Mark sends a long-Distance
  oral expression
across the miles to Lori...
(laughs)
  Who's slow-Jammin'
  in chicago.
Ooh, you go!
  (laughing continues)
(blows kiss)
  Mark dedicates this next
  song to you, Lori.
Here's Brian Mcknight.
Oh!
  (Robert) Oh! (laughs)
(Lori laughs)
  Here's Brian Mcknight!
? Lori's the queen of QVC ?
  (laughter)
? You can take it to the bank ?
? but Mark's the fiercest
  shark in the tank ?
that's right.
Brian isn't only one of
  the most requested artists
on "Sunday night Slow jams,"
but he's also a fan
  of the show himself.
Sharks, listen, there's
  no greater feeling than love,
and every Sunday night,
people all over the world
  fall in Love
all over again because of
  the "Sunday night slow jams."
? It's the the "Sunday night
  slow Jams" ?
? Everybody, it's the "Sunday
  night slow jams" ?
It's True.
"Sunday night slow Jams" Has
  amazing ratings in every city.
But I need your help
  to grow the show
and get it on in every Market
  across America.
Look, more radio stations
  mean more money.
So, sharks, tell me,
  who's ready to slow jam?
? It's "The Sunday night
  slow Jams" ?
? Help me sing it, it's the ?
(with Brian)
  ? "Sunday night slow Jams" ?
(Robert) Whoo!
  (laughter)
Brian Mcknight, yeah!
  (Brian) I'm here all week.
Mcknight, baby! Yeah!
  Thank you all.
  Thank you. Thank you.
Whoo!
Brian, what's your
  connection to everything?
Uh, we're friends, and...
  Oh, just friends?
  Okay.
that play the music
  that I create.
So... syndicated radio
  is a horrible business.
Wow. Where is the love?
What makes your show better,
  makes it stand out, profitable,
gives it an opportunity
  for an investor
to make his money back?
Well, "Sunday night slow Jams"
  Is already making money.
This year, we're gonna earn
  $350,000.
That's revenue, right?
  In ad sales, correct.
So how exactly does radio
  syndication work as a business?
I'm not very familiar
  with that.
Let me try to explain it
  a little bit.
I have--
  I have a lot of experience,
'cause when we did audionet,
  which turned into broadcast.Com,
we started
  the streaming business.
What happens is, R Dub creates
  his show, "Slow jams,"
and he goes to radio stations,
  when he says,
"Look, I'm gonna give you
  this amazing content for free.
"what I'm gonna get in return
  are radio commercials
that you'll run,
  that I'll sell."
And he says, "Okay, I have
  'x' number of listeners,
so my spot's worth
  'x' number of dollars per Spot."
Then he goes out there
  and tries to sell 'em.
(Kevin) it immediately leads
  to this question--
if I take a map of America,
  which Markets do you not have?
Well, there's 274
  rated Markets.
We're in 62 Markets, so we've
  barely tapped the potential.
Now I'm the investor. I got
  my investor hat on, saying...
  here we go.
There's tremendous
  growth potential here.
  Yeah.
But R Dub's been on
  for 160 years.
Why doesn't he have
  those Markets?
Because I am finally
  ready to hire
my own in-House affiliate
  sales director,
who--his entire job,
  8, 12, 15 hours a day,
is to not only travel
  But bang those phones
and spread the word about
  "Sunday night slow jams."
So is that what you're
  gonna do with the money?
  Absolutely.
The opportunities
  and the possibilities
are endless,
  but that is the solution,
is hiring the one guy.
Do 19- And 20-year-Olds
  really listen to slow jams?
Bruno Mars released a huge
  number-One slow jam this year.
Rihanna, Usher, Frank ocean--
  There's a huge resurgence.
And let me ask you this--
  Have you ever been in love?
(Robert and Lori laugh)
Daymond?
  Many times.
  He's still paying for it.
(laughter)
  do you remember the first
  time you fell in love?
Do you remember that feeling
  deep down inside,
those--Those butterflies?
  That's what the show captures.
Last time I had those feelings,
my stock hit a hundred bucks
  a share.
(laughter)
Let's not even discuss
  the valuation.
You say you're worth $750,000.
Sure.
  Let's leave that aside,
because we're in love
  right now.
  We are in love.
? We're in love ?
  Oh, sorry.
  How do I get... (laughs)
? How do I get
  my $75,000 back? ?
  (laughter)
We are about to explode,
  and we are about to grow
faster than We've ever
  grown before.
Even if we simply maintain,
for $75,000 you get
  a 20% return on your money.
That's simple math.
(Lori) I love romantic Music,
but when I sit here and think
  about you really expanding,
I'm not sure it's just this
  sales manager that you need.
I feel like you need a hook.
You need something
  really clever and unique
that draws people in.
I feel like there needs
  to be more,
and so, for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thank you very much
  for your time and for listening.
The radio Market
  as an investment sucks.
I can tell you that
  as an institutional investor.
This is radioactive waste
  out there. It's terrible.
R Dub, thank you very much,
  but I'll pass. I'm out.
You've been doing it
  for 20 years,
and you're making
  a good living,
and you're in 40%
  of the potential Market?
That's the positive.
But I just don't think one sales
  guy makes the entire business.
Because if that's the key
  for you,
find a guy, give him some
  percentage of your business,
and he will really hustle
  for you out there.
  Yeah.
That's the path that I see.
I don't see how you're gonna
  build a business
with my $75,000. I'm out.
Look, you're in an industry
that, as you know,
  is incredibly difficult.
Your Market is geared towards
  a Younger audience,
and that Market does listen
  more online,
does listen to their ipods
and use devices
  to get their music.
I don't think you're doing
  things in a way
that you could reach
  the Younger audience,
the demographics
  that you want to go to.
I think it's gonna make it
  tough, if not impossible,
for any investor
  to get their money back,
and for those reasons,
  I'm out.
and blow up the slow jam
  industry by ourselves, but...
  (laughter)
All right, good luck, guys.
I don't listen
  to the type of radio
that you are producing,
and I just don't
  understand it.
I have to be passionate about
  the businesses I invest in.
I'm out.
All right. Hey, sharks,
  thank you so much for your time.
Thank you, guys.
  Thanks, Brian. Great job.
Thanks, Brian.
Long road home?
  (laughs)
(laughs)
? Sunday night slow jams ?
Brian, even the biggest
  financial tycoon
I'm Pete Hamborg.
  This is my oldest son Gus.
in Sunny Huntington Beach,
  California,
and we are the inventors
  of hamboards.
We are the epitome of
a Southern California
  beach family.
Me and my all my brothers
  are all lifeguards,
my dad's a firefighter,
  and we all surf.
I've lived and surfed
  in Huntington Beach
for over 35 years.
I realized that
  that great surfing feeling
that I've been able
  to enjoy
is something that
  everyone wants to connect with.
That's why we created
  our product.
We have a product
  that will allow people
all over the country
  to truly experience
the feeling of surfing--
  Without water.
Hamboards is growing.
  Our orders are increasing,
and we really sense
  the hamboards brand
is gaining traction.
We need an investment
  from the sharks
because we simply don't have
  enough money
to make the amount of boards
  we need to meet the demand.
We would like to expand
  hamboards
into the rest of America
so that everyone can enjoy
  surfing,
(surf music playing)
(Robert) whoa.
Oh, that is so cool.
Hi. I'm Pete Hamborg
  from Hamboards.
I'm the founder.
  This is Donnie. He's my cousin.
  Hi.
We're asking for $100,000
  for 15% of our company.
When skateboarding
  was first invented,
the idea was to get
  a piece of wood
to feel like surfing
  when you rode it.
It's been the unattainable
  holy grail of skateboard design.
A few years back,
  I had five little grommets
running around the house,
and I wanted to teach them
  how to surf.
One of the things I wanted
  to add to the process
of teaching them how to surf
was to make
  a really large skateboard.
What I ended up making
  was something
that really didn't work
  that well.
Thank god, one night,
  one of my little brothers
left the giant skateboard
  out in the driveway,
and my mom backed over it
  in the family wagon.
When we jumped on it,
  we actually realized,
hey, this thing feels like
  surfing for the first time.
And what she had done
  when she had backed over it
was she had modified
  the trucks
so that it turned better.
My dad figured out
  a way to replicate that,
and we started making
  boards for ourselves
and riding them
  all over Huntington Beach.
People were freaking out.
  People wanted to buy 'em.
And so the next thing you knew,
we had a little business
  in our garage,
making these
  giant skateboards.
But I didn't really know
  the business dynamics.
You know, 'cause Gus
  and his brothers,
they're all lifeguards.
  I'm a fireman.
So we were kind of hitting
  some rough waters.
So we shook the family tree,
  and Donnie fell out...
(laughing)
  And we hit the ground
  running.
These guys are terrific
  at product and promotions,
but the first time I had
  a real business meeting,
we went through the "cost
  to goods sold" Spreadsheet,
and about an hour in,
  these guys needed
a yoga break
  and a 20-Minute nap.
So fast-forward to today.
You know,
  I'm the company hard-Ass,
We're hitting
  our monthly objectives
like a small business team
  should.
And the thing is growing out
  from under us.
What's your business
  background, Donnie?
I have a business background
from working at Dupont
  for ten years,
and then I've been
  an entrepreneur
for about ten years.
I built
  a sporting goods business.
I invented a technology
  that made
inflated sports Balls
  stay inflated
for an awful long time
  that was called never flat.
Oh, those are
  the Spalding balls that--
  That's right.
Yeah, yeah, that the nba used.
  That's right. That was it.
Very clever. Okay, so you got
  some background in this.
  Yeah.
You know
  what you're doing.
So who wants to jump on one of
  these things and try 'em out?
I wanna try it out.
  (Gus) Come on. Get over here.
We gotta get you
  a helmet.
  All right.
Can I try one?
  (Richard) Yeah, yeah.
(Gus) We got plenty.
  For sure.
All right.
I have a really,
  really big head.
(Richard) So the bigger ones
  are easier to use
because of the...
  they're a little more
  stable.
What you wanna do--You wanna be
  in the front half of the board
when you're trying it
  for the first time.
  (Gus) Yeah.
Up probably on the sticker.
  And don't be afraid
  to get yourself some speed.
Yeah. Yeah.
  You're gonna be fine.
(Pete) That's it. That's it.
  (Mark) No way!
Oh, that is so cool.
Whoo!
  (laughter)
Ta-Da!
  Nice.
(laughter)
(Pete) there it is!
Hey--There you go.
  (Mark) There he goes. Wow.
Tell us about the company.
  What are the sales?
How long you been doing it?
Well, uh, so,
  for the last 12 months,
our sales are $225,000.
For this calendar year,
  our plan is to hit $350,000.
(Kevin) Don, you've been
  in the sports business.
These sales are anemic.
Quarter of a million dollars
  is peanuts.
  Right.
it's gotta get into
  the millions.
  That's right.
How do you get to $10 million
  in this business?
So we just brought on
  our first two reps
So we're looking at getting
  into the surf, skate,
action sports stores.
Have you made this
  proprietary?
We have an intellectual
  property portfolio
comprising design patents...
  Yeah.
On all the models,
  tradeMarks--
But based on the modification
  of the wheel set?
We don't have a utility
  patent on that modification, no.
(Lori) So do other people
  then make
a surfboard with wheels?
You can find a product
  that looks like that.
In fact, we had somebody
  that bought one
from somebody else,
  and they called us up
wanting to return it to us
  because it didn't ride
like a hamboard
  is supposed to ride.
Which size
  is the best seller?
This is our--This is our most
  popular board right here.
It's, uh, called
  the bamboo classic.
So it's made out of
  solid bamboo.
Uh, it retails for $595.
And then our next
  most popular is--
How much does it--
  Let's start there.
  How much does it cost
  to make that?
How much does it cost
  to make it?
  One-Third of that.
So $200?
  Roughly speaking.
Okay. And where--
  Where do you make them?
Everything is assembled
  and built in Huntington Beach.
Okay.
  (Lori)
  I think, very cool product.
Love family businesses.
But it seems to me
  more of a niche product,
maybe more coastal
  than heartland.
I think I can get you excited
  for a bigger Market
if I can walk back here and pull
  something else out of here.
Okay.
  Sure.
(Robert) There's more?
  There's more.
hamboard Plus land paddle
  equals freedom.
Oh!
Interesting.
  (Pete) Check this out.
And that is how you
  commute to work?
Yes.
  That's right.
(Lori) Very cool product.
Think you guys are great,
  and Innovation's great.
I personally feel
  it's maybe coastal,
more, in popularity,
and more of a niche Market,
and so for that reason...
Mm-hmm.
  I'm out.
Thanks.
What's your core competency?
What's gonna make you
  a great company?
Our honest hope is
that we get to start
  with this terrific product
that really connects with people
  that love the surf culture,
see, But just saying that you
  extend surf culture elsewhere
isn't big enough.
because you've got to get
  to the point where you're
selling 10,000
  or 20,000 or 30 th--
I mean,
  with tower paddle boards--
they're
  online Marketing gurus.
We went from doing
  $40,000
to we'll do probably
  $3 million this year.
I wasn't interested until you
  brought the land paddles, right?
Right.
  Because
  now all of a sudden
there's stand-Up paddleboard
  for water.
Now there's stand-Up
  paddleboard for land.
Yeah.
  Exactly.
I can get that,
  but if you're telling me
this is all about
  surfing culture...
  well--
That's not gonna resonate
  with a 13-year-old kid
on a lake outside of Dallas.
I'm out.
I'm not worried about
  the culture issue as much,
because there is a very large
  skateboard industry.
You can define it in hundreds
  of millions of dollars.
You have to figure out how to
  get some percentage share of it.
  Mm-hmm.
Had you shown me
  that you've found that model
and that you were starting
  at $250,000 in sales
in the form of dollars
  to pour on it,
I made have made
  an investment here today.
But you don't have that.
So I'm out.
I-I have a level of interest
  in it.
I'm--I'm--I'm looking
  at this as something
for us to go out and license,
  and I--it would be a big gamble.
The objective is for me
  to go out and help
and assist to license
  this product immediately,
fast, and get it out there.
Are you making an offer?
Yes. $100,000 for 30%.
Peter, I don't see it
  as a licensing thing today.
You are not selling
  water paddleboards on land.
Mm-Mm.
  You're selling
  the California dream, baby.
Right. Yeah.
  (Lori laughs)
Three sharks are out.
Gus, Pete, and Donnie
  have an offer from Daymond,
but it's for double the equity
  they originally offered,
but now Robert
  seems interested.
You are not selling
  water paddleboards on land.
Mm-Mm.
  You're selling
  the California dream, baby.
Right. Yeah.
  (Lori laughs)
There is gonna be
  a percentage of your customer
that is the hard-core surfer...
  Mm-hmm.
But the much bigger percentage
is gonna be old, chubby guys
  like me
that want to be kids like Gus.
  (Pete) right.
That's the big Market.
  Mm-hmm.
But to do that,
  you have to have a great brand.
Yes.
  You cannot be more authentic
than a fireman
  with Five lifeguard kids
in Huntington Beach.
  Right.
I actually think
  your valuation was fair.
Thank you.
But I think you're gonna
  need more money.
  Mm-hmm.
And I want to be a bigger
  partner with you guys.
  Mm-hmm.
You need some discipline
  in this business,
and that's where I can
  help you.
I'll give you $300,000
  for one-Third.
You guys have two huge offers
from two huge sharks.
Robert is basically
  "do it yourself."
You were gonna license
  the boards, too, right?
I want to license the boards.
  I want to license the clothing.
But they can still
  do their own boards.
'cause you're gonna have
  to have that core following
of, well, this was actually
  made by the hamboard guys.
(Robert) I want to be
  in this business.
$300,000, 33%.
  Do we have a deal?
30? 30%?
30%.
Robert, we want to do
  business with you.
  All right!
Great job, guys!
  Awesome.
Bad move.
Right on.
  Bad move.
Nice job, guys.
  Thanks, everyone.
See ya!
  (Lori) Good luck, guys.
(laughter)
We just got three times
  what we were asking for.
I am charged up.
I am super stoked.
That was a great deal.
  Great deal.
I wonder if you overpaid
  for that.
I think the valuation
  was fair.
It's a little rich,
  but I-I get it.
You'll find out.
Last season, Nate Holzapfel
  came to the Shark Tank
with his innovative company,
  the mission belt...
it's like a giant zip-Tie
  for your pants.
And scored a deal
  with Daymond John.
Daymond, I'd be crazy to not
  want a partner like you.
I accept 100%.
  My man.
Let's see what he's up to now.
When I went on "Shark Tank,"
I was so blown away
  and so honored
when Daymond wanted to invest
  in my company.
Hey, what's up, nate?
  Hey, Daymond.
  What's going on, man?
The best part about Daymond
is he is totally accessible
  to me at all times.
It's like being on the same
  team with Michael Jordan.
This is a great start,
  but this is just the beginning.
Before "Shark Tank,"
  we had only sold
$39,000 worth of product
  in 3 months.
Our very first Night
  after Airing,
we sold $180,000 worth.
And within a month, we became
  a million-Dollar company.
Hey, guys,
  we got some great news.
We just sold
  our 50,000th belt.
(cheering)
We've projected $3 million
  in sales in the next 6 months.
That'll put us at $5 million
  since airing.
Thanks for calling
  mission belt.
This is becca.
  How can I help you?
When I pitched in the tank,
I was the only employee
  of the mission belt co.,
and I was selling these
  door-To-Door.
Now we have over 20 employees
  and our own facility.
It's an amazing feeling
  to create jobs
in your own community.
It's nice to be able
  to create an environment
where people want to come
  to work and have a lot of fun,
and can take care
  of their families.
Every time somebody
  buys a belt,
we use it to help families
  feed themselves.
Mission belts has always had
  a mission--
To end world Hunger
  by helping people
become self-Sufficient.
Rather than just giving
  people food,
to go out and get their own
  farms going and feed themselves.
Thanks very much
  for a great effort.
  (applause)
going on "Shark Tank"
  is the single best decision
I've made for my business.
It's taken a small
  little product
that was run out of my apartment
and made it into
  a multimillion-dollar company.
That's only in America.
  Only on "Shark Tank."
(all) Thank you, "Shark Tank"!
whoo!
  Whoo!
in his college dorm room,
with a big vision
  for the future.
I'm here seeking an investment
  of $1 million
for 5% of my company.
Now, sharks, before you
  grill me with your questions,
I have a question for you.
How often
  in your day-To-Day lives
do you see one of these
  scannable codes?
They're everywhere.
At scan, we developed
  a mobile app
which is the easiest way
  to scan and interact
with any of these codes.
  Let me show you how.
So first I'm going to scan
  the barcode
from this camera's packaging.
It's as easy as...
  (beep)
and that quickly, my app
  just did a price check
showing me
  how I can save $25.
Next, I'm going to scan
  the Q.R. Code
from the tag
  of this mission belt.
Daymond, have you heard
  of this company before?
  (laughing)
Yes. Mission belt.
  Great company.
Then you're going
  to love this.
(beep)
They, using our Web site,
created their own
  custom Code
that can Link
  to their Web site,
their youtube channel
  for a video.
Do you want somebody
  to actually be able
to purchase a product?
Or, as you see here,
  their twitter.
So in one tap, that easily,
  I just followed them on twitter.
How cool is that?
This all started
  just two years ago.
Together with
  two of my classmates,
we set out on a mission
  to connect the real world
with the digital universe.
We are still young
  and foolish enough
to believe that we can
  change the world
from our college
  dorm room.
So, sharks, which of you
We have our mobile app,
  which is available
in the app store,
iphone, ipad, ipod,
android devices,
  and windows.
Is it free?
  When we started,
we were focusing on growing
  our user base,
and so we started
  with a free app,
kept it very simple.
It grew like crazy,
  and over time,
as the company has grown,
we've started to introduce
  better features
that users can pay for.
What's the most common
  application
that the enterprises,
  the businesses,
are doing on the site
  with the application?
A lot of people are going
  for the simple choices
to begin with.
They're saying,
  "Here's our Q.R. Code,
"and it links
  to our facebook page
so you can 'like' us,"
  or "It links to our instagram."
Very easy stuff.
I create a Q.R. Code
that links to the actual
  product and its price.
So now I don't just
  scan this belt
and get more information,
  I can scan this belt
and purchase it in one tap.
How many active users
  does it have?
Actually, let me check.
I don't want
  to tell you wrong.
All right, so here is
  a live ticker
Showing people downloading
  our app.
We get about a little more
  than one a second.
51 million downloads?
  That doesn't say anything.
How many scans
  do you have a day?
I can tell you that last month,
  there were 27 million people
who took out our app
  and scanned it.
do you have any competition
  for this?
This wasn't, like,
  the newest, best idea.
But when I looked
  at the other competition,
I didn't see anybody
  executing on it
how I felt it needed
  to be executed.
One mistake that a lot
  of our competition have made
is they kind of built
  half of the table.
They didn't build the full
  360 experience like we did.
Because people can go
  to our Web site
and create codes,
and people can use
  our own app,
we're the entire space.
How do you make money
  with this?
That's why I'm here.
  We're just now starting
to focus more and more
  on monetization.
The plan is to keep a lot of
  the user side of Things
completely free.
And then, for businesses,
  they can come,
choose what type of Code
  they want to create,
pay a monthly fee
  to host that code
and keep it live
  and Working, and--
has there been monetization
  up until this point?
Not on the live Web site.
If you went
  to our Web site right now,
you would not see, uh...
have you made any money today?
So we've made about
  $30,000 a month
for the last few months
  by reaching out
to a few
  of our big companies
that have already been using
  our product and then say,
"We want to choose you
  as a beta customer"...
and they're paying you
  for the beta?
Correct.
Are-aren't you concerned
  that Q.R. Codes
are becoming dodo birds?
What's the future?
  Because, I mean,
I can make an argument
  that Q.R. Codes are gone.
Can I show you?
  Yeah, absolutely.
I'm gonna show you
  something special
we've been working on.
So I received a package
  just the other day from google.
So this is google glass.
Okay, glass, scan this
  Q.R. Code.
That easily I can interact
  with the digital world.
So that's it?
  That's what you did there?
Like, all you showed me there--
  as--as a tech guy--
Was just another
  hardware platform.
But google sent this to you
  to do what?
To start implementing
  our scanning technology
on both the business side
  and the user side
into their hardware.
Not impressed.
  Not impressed.
I'm impressed by
  the 51 million downloads
and your users--
  That's great, right?
But you're not telling me
  you're doing anything unique.
You've got a platform,
  google goggles.
They have
  a developers' program.
There's gonna be other people
  doing scannables.
You haven't said what it is
  that you're doing
that differentiates you
  from any of the many.
You know, are you doing
  something better with software?
Are you better integration
  with third parties?
Is your a.P.I. Easier?
The things
  you were talking about--
like, our a.P.I.
  Was easier to work with,
the scan was just
  that much faster.
  (snaps fingers)
the design was just that much
  more simple and beautiful.
It was very small things
  that people don't think
they care about,
  so when we went out
against a huge competition,
we were able
  to rise to the top.
How much money has been
  invested in your company
over the last two years?
When we were six months
  into the business,
we had already passed
  one million downloads.
We started to hear
  from investors.
To be honest, I didn't know
  a lot about investors.
And where did I learn
  so much of the stuff initially?
From "Shark Tank."
And when google ventures
  wanted to meet with us,
I was, like,
  in "Shark Tank" Mode,
and I said, "I'm looking
  for this much money,
and I want this,
  deal or no deal."
And they looked at me and said,
  "That's not how this works."
But I learned
  from that experience,
so total, we've raised
  $8.7 million.
(Daymond)
  8.7 raised already.
Why are you exactly here?
Is it just for exposure?
No. Definitely not.
Every time we've
  involved somebody,
we give somebody
  this much of the business,
and they deliver us
  this much value.
I believe the carpet is there
for those who desperately
  need help,
the banks turned them down,
  they've lost a lot,
or they--they don't have
  any hope.
I don't think you need
  the money. I'm out.
I think you are amazing.
  You obviously are brilliant.
But I am not the best person
  sitting here
to help you
  in this technical Arena.
So for that reason,
  I'm going out.
It hurts every time.
  (chuckles)
ask for a million dollars
  in flip-flops.
Oh.
  So--but that's cool.
(laughs)
  Um... look,
there's no doubting
  the downloads.
Unbelievably impressive.
But there's nothing
  proprietary,
and I worry about
  the competition as it grows.
For that reason, I'm out.
Your valuation is $20 million
for a business that actually
  doesn't have yet
a business model
  that is recurring.
So the leap of faith
  for any shark
is just risk tolerance,
  I think. That's it.
I can't make that leap of faith.
Show me the money,
  not the downloads.
I'm out.
I've notice a pattern.
As I've been meeting
  with investors,
there have been those
  that look at me,
and those who look
  at my numbers.
There's investors that think
  there's a perfect recipe
to success every time.
  I don't believe in that.
I believe, to do something
  truly amazing,
there's got to be
  a little bit of crazy,
a little bit of foolish.
You're--You're giving me
  a lot of visions,
but you're not giving me
  a lot of realities.
I'm a big fan
  of the sensor business.
I think that's the future
  of technology.
The fundamental problem
  that I have is
scans versus sensors.
In a sensor-Driven world,
  the information
is accumulated and gathered
  everywhere
with No action by the user,
whereas in your world,
whether it's google glasses
  where you have to talk,
whether you have to take
  your phone and scan,
in a sensor-Driven world,
  these don't exist.
So for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thank you very much
  for all of your time.
Yes, very impressive.
  Very impressive.
Great job.
  Good luck.
Look what "Shark Tank"
  Is producing--
Kids like that.
  Amazing, right?
Yes, very impressive.
  Amazing.
I'm scared.
  Brilliant guy.
(Daymond) I'm very, very proud.
  Now... I want a royalty.
(laughs)
and especially in us young guys
  that are running this company
is definitely
  a big leap of faith.
But that's the part
  I like about it.
That's the beauty
  of entrepreneurship at its best.
with a business
  made in their garage.
and I'm Brian.
Sharks, we're seeking
  a $30,000 investment
for a 25% stake
  in our company...
(all) Screenmend.
"What's Screenmend?",
  you ask?
It's the easiest way
  to patch A screen ever.
Screenmend was invented
  about three years ago.
When my mom made us
  clean out the porch.
I was trying to patch
  a hole in the porch screen
with a self-Adhesive patch,
  but it wasn't working.
He just kept trying
  to press the patch on,
Lily was trying to scrape
  some melted wax off the table.
I hate that job.
Well, when our dad
  complained about
"Hey, brain"--
  our nickname for our dad--
"Why don't you put wax
  on that patch?"
We realized Lily might be
  on to something,
so we tried creating
  a screen patch soaked in wax.
And it worked.
When the first patch
  stayed on for over a year,
we realized that we had
  created a simple
and Marketable solution
  to a common household problem.
the fastest and easiest way
  to patch a screen.
You've got it, brain.
(laughter)
  "Brain."
Simply cut the patch to size
and apply with heat
  from a hair Dryer
for 30 to 60 seconds.
(whirring)
now that's on the hottest
  temperature, right?
Yes.
  Yes, it is.
(hair Dryer turns off)
and you're done.
Screenmend is fast, easy,
  and extremely effective.
Sharks, we built this business
  from the ground up,
and now we need your help.
I want to grow my business
so I can sit where you are
  one day.
  (laughs)
So who wants to make a deal
and help us mend screens
  all across America?
Sometimes
  the simplest products
make the best products,
  because...
  Yeah, it really,
  really helped us,
because we had, um,
  we had a Bunny...
(laughs)
  And she would just
  eat through the screens.
This is Bunny-Proof?
  Yeah.
(laughter)
  Lily, do you mind asking
  how old you are?
I'm 12.
  I'm 15.
How many of these
  have you sold?
750.
750 units?
  Yes.
Brian, what do you
  sell them for?
$6.95.
What does it cost you
  to make it?
31 cents.
(Lori) Wow.
  Nice. Good job.
That's a nice margin.
  You need bigger margins.
Where are you manufacturing?
We've expanded from
  the kitchen to the garage.
and the materials
  are 31 cents.
How many competitors
  are out there?
There's at least three
  or four competitors.
They're nothing like us,
  though.
  (laughs) You tell 'em.
They--they just--
  Ours are better.
Why are you better, Lily?
  Yeah, why are you better?
Why are you better?
Well, because ours
  stays on for longer,
and it's quicker,
  and the other patches
and then the others, once it's
  exposed to the elements--
Dust, wind, rain, etcetera--
The backing wears off,
  and it falls off.
And yours does not
  fall off in rain?
Nope.
  Nope.
What stops your competitor
  from just doing
the wax gig you're doing?
Well, we do have
  a provisional patent.
So you think that'll survive?
  It'll actually clear?
Well, we hope to grow
to be able to afford
  a utility patent.
Did you do any type
  of patentability search
to see if there's any prior
  out--out there
that would preclude you
  from getting a patent?
Uh, I have not.
  Um, we have invested
all the capital, um,
  from the business
back into the business,
  and that's why we're here.
Um, we would like to grow
  our packaging,
because we had, um, interest
from BED bath &amp; beyond
  and home depot,
but they said they couldn't put
  our products in their store
because of the packaging.
The packaging needed work.
  So...
why?
Because they can't hang it
  on, like, clips or anything.
  Clip strip.
And we really didn't know
  where to go from there.
So the problem is getting this
  into retail,
which requires
  a packaging redesign.
Exactly.
  Yes.
I think you guys have
  come up with something great,
but I more want to do it
  from the standpoint
that I'm a dad like you,
  you know?
And you have two great girls.
The challenge is
  it's just a lot of work.
You know, if I give you
  the money
I understand. Thank you
  for your consideration.
Thank you.
  Thank you.
This business is too small
  for me to invest in.
It's tugging
  at my heartstrings,
and I never let that
  influence me as a an investor.
I'm--I'm profoundly, uh,
  supportive
of what you're trying to do.
But to build this business up
  is going to be
a fair amount of work,
and I don't want to go on that
  journey with you, unfortunately.
I'm out.
All right.
Thank you.
(Robert) Brian, let me tell you
  where I'm at.
You guys have done
  a great job with this.
You're going to be successful,
but I don't see how I can
  invest today
To help grow my money.
  I'm out.
(Mark) Look, guys,
  tell you a quick story.
When I was 16,
  started collecting stamps.
I went to a stamp show,
bought a stamp for 50 cents.
I took that stamp into
  another stamp dealer.
It turns out
  it was a $50 stamp.
Boom. I made $49.50
  just like that.
And I started growing
  my little business,
But he introduced me
  to somebody
who gave me
  a few thousand dollars.
I grew that business
  and grew that business,
paid his money back,
and I'll be forever
  grateful to him.
I'm not gonna let you guys
  not get a deal.
It's not about the money.
I'll give you guys $30,000
  for 25%.
I'm not here to tell you
  I'm--I'm an expert
in any of this.
  I have no clue.
But I know how to find
  people that do.
Somebody stood up for me.
  I'll stand up for you guys.
Do you want to do a deal?
(inhales) We would...
  (exhales)
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Three sharks are out.
Seeing himself
  in the young entrepreneurs,
Mark has offered
  the Hooks family
exactly what they asked for.
I'm not gonna let you guys
  not get a deal.
It's not about the money.
I'll give you guys $30,000
  for 25%.
Somebody stood up for me.
  I'll stand up for you guys.
Do you want to do a deal?
We would...
  (exhales)
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I love what you did.
Your ages--Amazing.
To create something
  that it appears
that no one else has been
  able to do as well--
We're talking major corporations
  with millions of dollars.
I feel the way
  to really benefit you
would be for me to take over
  the manufacturing,
to get you into
  bed bath &amp; beyond
with the right packaging,
and then to give you
  tv presence.
So, Mark, I'd like to offer you
  to go in with me,
but because I know how much
  work and effort
it's going to take,
because we're really starting
  from ground up,
so I would want 50%
  of the company,
It's okay. But my offer
  would be 50/50
for the $30,000.
You've got an offer
  from Mark--$30,000 for 25%.
Twice as much equity from Lori
  for $30,000,
but she wants 50%.
What are you gonna do?
(Robert) Do you need
  to talk about it?
I think we'd like to.
  I think--Yeah.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Really smart little girls.
Mark is being
  very generous...
yes.
  But Lori is willing to go
  the extra yard...
really.
  To put this out there.
I think there is
  a lot of work here.
I think there's
  a tremendous amount of work.
I-I don't think...
  (Daymond) No, there's
  a lot of work.
Lori's wrong
  in what she's doing.
  No, Lori's absolutely right.
Let's summarize
  where we're at,
'cause this is
  a reMarkable turnaround here.
Got two offers.
Mark is willing to give you
  what you asked for--
$30,000 for 25%.
Lori wants more because she
  feels she has to do more work--
50% for the same amount
  of money.
What do you want to do?
Lori, we accept your offer.
(Daymond) All right, Good.
  Good.
Congratulations.
  And thank you so much, Mark.
Thank you.
  Thank you so much.
No problem at all.
(laughing)
  Thank you so much.
You're very clever
  young women.
(Mark laughs)
  (Kevin) whoa!
Oh, nice.
  Let me try that.
Lori, I have a very big house.
  You're coming to my house
to fix all my screens
  right now.
  (laughs)
Oh...
  Oh, my God.
(laughs)
(Lily) It's really exciting
  working with Lori
because, um, I know Lori
  can get our product
into stores and on, like,
  tv shows,
and that just would really
  help us out.
