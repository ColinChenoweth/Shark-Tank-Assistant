Robert:
We pretty much put it
Teresa: We've spent
every dime of our savings.
Herjavec: Teresa, what are
the flavors we have?
because I actually think getting
Robert full time is crucial.
I write you a check
for $150,000,
you quit your job
tomorrow morning
or as soon
as you get the cash,
Okay.
Robert.
Herjavec: I want to come in
with Lori.
I'd love to be in on this
'cause I think
she believes in you guys
just like I believe in you guys.
I'll go down to the 20%.
So, $75,000 for 20%.
At the time that Robert's
ready to come back in,
we'll give you another
$75,000 for that salary.
But because you're getting
two of us,
we want a 20-cent royalty
along the way.
Ooh.
Robert offered you
more than you asked for,
Robert: We really
appreciate the offers,
$75,000 in the future
when we need Robert,
Robert: We envisioned ourselves
coming in here today,
