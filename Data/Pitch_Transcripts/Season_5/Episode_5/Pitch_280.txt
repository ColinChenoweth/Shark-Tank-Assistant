Hi, sharks.
We are the Schaub family.
Thanks, Amber.
Cute.
Is that cute?
of what Amber's little idea
has become.
So, sharks, what do
you need to know
to come join this ruffled
revolution with us?
Okay, Jonas,
go with sissy.
No!
There's skittles
down there.
[ Laughs ]
You want to go home
with sissy?
Aww.
See, he didn't agree
with the valuation
before it came out.
[ Laughs ]
Amber, you have a big number
on this business.
Tell us about your sales.
Absolutely.
We did $3.7 million
in sales last year.
Awesome.
Amber, tell us a little bit more
about yourself.
Amber: In the end, it was
a really tough decision.
Every percent of equity
is coming from our family.
When Lori showed that she was
willing to compromise with us,
that she came to the 9%,
we knew that she was
the right partner
for our business.
