Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first Internet
companies for over $350 million.
Lori Grenier, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents
and has launched
over 300 products
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.
My name is Teresa fraijo.
This is my husband Robert.
We live in Laguna Niguel,
California,
Robert:
We pretty much put it
Teresa: We've spent
every dime of our savings.
We've borrowed money
from family and friends.
And we even sold the diamond
out of my wedding ring,
so we have a lot
riding on this.
Ready?
Go get it!
My family
is so important to me.
They have been...
[ Voice breaking ]
They've been a huge, huge,
um, inspiration and help to us
to get this going,
and we couldn't have done it
without all of their help.
Hello, sharks.
And this is my husband,
Robert -- Veggie Papa.
Herjavec: Teresa, what are
the flavors we have?
We have carrot Berry, citrus
cucumber, and sweet potato pie.
Wow.
It's really good.
Thank you.
This is gluten-free, this
is dairy-free, this is vegan.
I thought it was gonna taste
like crap, and it's pretty good.
Thank you.
because I actually think getting
Robert full time is crucial.
I write you a check
for $150,000,
you quit your job
tomorrow morning
or as soon
as you get the cash,
and then you start
selling this.
You start paying me
50 cents a unit
until I get
my $150,000 back.
After I get back my $150,000,
I get 25 cents a unit.
I'm your bank.
I don't need your equity.
Okay.
Well, you know, whenever Kevin
likes to spice things up,
Okay.
Robert.
Herjavec: I want to come in
with Lori.
I'd love to be in on this
'cause I think
she believes in you guys
just like I believe in you guys.
I'll go down to the 20%.
So, $75,000 for 20%.
At the time that Robert's
ready to come back in,
we'll give you another
$75,000 for that salary.
But because you're getting
two of us,
we want a 20-cent royalty
along the way.
Ooh.
Now you have to give up
royalties and equity.
There's a lesson there.
When you offer
something for sale
and you put the deal
on the table and they say yes,
you don't look over
their shoulder.
Robert offered you
more than you asked for,
and you didn't respond.
Let me put this
in a different way.
When you walk
into the shark tank,
you look for the sucker,
and if you don't see one,
it's you.
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.
Teresa and Robert have
two offers on the table.
Kevin has offered $150,000
for a 50-cent royalty,
which goes down to 25 cents
after he recoups his investment.
Lori and Robert
have also offered $150,000,
but for a 20% stake,
plus a 20-cent royalty.
So, you're
one handshake away.
Robert: We really
appreciate the offers,
and we appreciate
your experience
and the connections
that you have.
I think where we are stuck
is the 20-cent royalty.
What's your counter?
We'll keep
the $75,000 now,
$75,000 in the future
when we need Robert,
and keep you at 20%.
It's a good counter, but I want
to stay with the royalty.
You're getting the two of us.
It's a fair amount of equity.
A lower --
do you know that the 20-cent
royalty going forward...
A lower royalty
than Kevin's.
...is exactly 10%
of everything you sell.
You realize that?
That's like giving them
an extra 10% free stock.
Is that what you're after?
Are you coming back in, or are
you just gonna give more --
Robert: We envisioned ourselves
coming in here today,
