Hi, sharks.
We are the Schaub family.
Thanks, Amber.
Cute.
Is that cute?
of what Amber's little idea
has become.
So, sharks, what do
you need to know
to come join this ruffled
revolution with us?
Okay, Jonas,
go with sissy.
No!
There's skittles
down there.
[ Laughs ]
You want to go home
with sissy?
Aww.
See, he didn't agree
with the valuation
before it came out.
[ Laughs ]
Amber, you have a big number
on this business.
Tell us about your sales.
Absolutely.
We did $3.7 million
in sales last year.
Awesome.
And we are on track to
do between $4.5 and
$5 million this year.
Wow.
We started, we were
profitable in year one,
and we have grown
every year since.
We actually landed
on the inc. 500 list
at number eight
in all of retail.
This adorable little red outfit
with the ruffle bottom,
what do you sell it for?
They're right around
$25 apiece.
Great value.
Cuban: So, you probably have
debt right now.
You probably have --
no debt?
Wow.
Who owns the company?
Amber, tell us a little bit more
about yourself.
I was in real estate,
and I found a lot of success,
but there was
something missing.
And I was really lacking
the fulfillment
that I needed from my career,
and there was this --
creating a product,
is that what was lacking there?
It was really this...
Entrepreneurial bug,
I guess I could say.
Do you have competitors
out there
Amber: In the end, it was
a really tough decision.
Every percent of equity
is coming from our family.
When Lori showed that she was
willing to compromise with us,
that she came to the 9%,
we knew that she was
the right partner
for our business.
