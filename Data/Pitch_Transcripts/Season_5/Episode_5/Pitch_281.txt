Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan
to building the city's
preeminent real-estate empire.
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
is a couple from North Carolina
with a company for fashionable
children everywhere.
Aww.
Ohh.
Corcoran:
Oh, look at them.
Oh, he's got
a little pocket thing, too.
Love the outfit.
I'm Amber.
I'm Mark.
affordable
to the masses.
Thank you so much.
Mark:
We are so proud
Oh, now we know who --
smart lady! Yeah!
Now we know
who wears the ruffles.
Herjavec: Wow, Mark,
I feel so bad for you.
He -- [ Laughs ]
So, how many skus
do you have?
So, I believe
it's about 700 skus...
Whoa.
Wow.
Whoa!
...in the ruffled bloomers.
as amazing strategic
partners.
We want your expertise.
We want your advice.
What you're saying is,
as you're growing
that are making styles
like yours?
Currently, we don't have
any one specific competitor
that we would say,
"they do exactly what we do."
2,700 skus
in a $5-million business --
that is a massive
red flag to me.
I-I experienced this
myself.
My family started a business
called "Kiddies Togs,"
winter clothing
for children.
Exact same trajectory.
What nearly killed us
is when we went past 200 skus.
Let me tell you
a little story
that comes from Greek mythology
I think you're gonna enjoy,
'cause I'm seeing it
right in front of me.
Zeus married a woman
named Demeter.
They had a daughter
named Persephone.
Everybody wanted to marry her,
including Hades.
[ Chuckles ]
One day she was
picking flowers
'cause she was always tempted
to go for more colors.
The earth opened, she fell
into the bowels of hell.
Oh, no!
Is there a point?
Yeah, you're gonna
get to it in a second.
You're gonna learn something,
too. Here we are in hell.
Yes, we are in hell.
Persephone,
the most beautiful woman.
Okay!
His home.
I think it is remarkable
you've gotten to this point
without any debt.
I couldn't have done that.
I-I can't help you
on a daily basis.
I wish I could.
I know how
to grow businesses,
as Mark said,
or the other stuff.
I'm out.
Okay, we have
two sharkettes left.
Why don't you start,
Barbara?
what difference
would it make?
Lori, may I finish, please?
...that what she's saying
is really necessary.
No, no. I'm not --
I'm not knocking it.
Are you staying at your offer,
or are you changing it?
No, no. They can respond
to the offer,
all right?
Okay.
The offers are very close
to each other.
Who do you want to
work with?
Lori's is just a loan.
May I mention to you
the $300,000
is a one-year loan
for equity.
It's more than a loan.
It's a lifetime
of experience.
do you need
any more information?
We honestly would be
beyond honored
to work with
either one of you.
I mean, obviously to me, you are
both inspirational women,
so it is definitely
something
I appreciate it.
Amber, this is business.
Go make a decision.
Got it.
Okay.
Wow.
That's interesting.
Does that affect the long-term
value of our company?
Yeah. I mean, it's --
the main reason here
is the strategic partnership
with either one of them.
Possibly.
Lori, that's the worst deal
you've ever offered to somebody.
Mark!
In fact --
I'm just telling you.
I'm just telling you the facts.
That's a Kevin deal.
O'Leary: No, it isn't!
It's a very smart,
financially astute deal.
For her,
not for them.
Oh, that --
that's right.
That is a Kevin deal.
It is a Kevin deal.
Let's summarize
what we've got here.
So, Barbara's offer
was the $600,000 for 12%.
However, $300,000 of that
is actually a loan
you have to pay back.
Lori's offer --
10% equity for the $600,000,
but she wants her money back
in 24 months.
What are you going to do?
We absolutely see the value
in strategic partnership
with working
with either one of you.
What our counter
would be --
the same $600,000
in exchange for 8% equity.
Would you compromise
at 10%?
If I met you halfway,
would you go the other half?
Herjavec: Nice job, mark.
You're a very talented
couple.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.
I can't believe
she took that.
Horrible deal.
When they wake up,
they'll realize they messed up.
No, no.
She made a very smart deal,
given the risk
that this company has.
Both: No, Lori did
a great deal.
I think it's terrific.
I don't think
they got it.
Oh, you guys.
Do you believe
we did this?
Narrator: In season three,
the four Mastronardo brothers
made a deal with Barbara
for their line of skin-care
products, Nardo's Natural.
We welcome you
to the family.
Wow, great!
Come on down here!
All right, thank you.
You won't regret it.
Narrator: Let's see
how they're doing now.
to make our business
a success
'cause that's what K.J.
would have wanted.
Corcoran: Hey, guys.
All: Hey, Barbara.
Since partnering with Barbara,
our business has exploded,
$500,000?!
 Did you make that up?
Barbara's
been a guiding light,
Thank you for calling
Nardo's Natural.
How may I help you?
making products
in the kitchen.
but it's made us bond
as brothers,
I'm Dr. Edna Ma,
a board-certified
anesthesiologist
Dr. Ma: Bareease
is a patented numbing kit
used before waxing or laser
so grooming the bikini line
doesn't have to be painful.
How does Bareease work?
The user wears the kit
before her appointment,
allowing time
to numb the skin.
Then immediately before her
service, she removes the kit,
Thank you, Edna.
Dr. ma: Uh, yes. 4% Lidocaine
is the maximum strength
you can sell over the counter
without a prescription
in the United States.
Doctor, at any one time,
how many women
are about to get
blasted?
[ Laughs ]
I'm glad you asked
that question.
We worked with the
world-renowned Kinsey Institute
at Indiana university...
Indiana university.
...to quantify this market
That seems remarkable
to me.
Yes.
Grooming the bikini line
is now considered
the new "cultural norm."
Yes, manscaping.
Haven't you heard of it?
Yeah, that's true.
What happens to the package
if a man tries this?
Permanent numbing.
[ Laughs ]
This is
the men's version.
O'Leary: Doctor, are you --
are you serious?
This is dead serious.
We created a men's version, too.
It's called "numb"...
Fill in the blank.
Okay.
Numb cashews.
How do you apply that?
[ Laughs ]
How did you come up
with the idea?
A few years ago,
I got my first Brazilian wax,
There are numbing creams
on the market,
Edna, how long have you
been selling it?
We've been selling
for about three years.
Together:
What are your sales?
Last year we sold
$45,000 worth of products,
The majority of our sales
are online.
Edna, what do you
sell it for?
It sells for $18 retail
for the kit.
Wholesale?
what does it cost you
to make it?
...right?
It costs me $2.82.
How do you j--
divvy up your time
in a market,
by your own definition,
that should be in the millions,
we're just not there.
Edna, I think you
could certainly make
a business of this,
but to use your own analogy,
like a baby company,
O'Leary: I'm not sure
about the market size.
I think there's
a lot of competition
for how you desensitize
the area,
but I think what I've seen
from the sales
is that it really hasn't grown
as fast I would have liked.
Herjavec: Edna, I --
yes, sir.
I think
it's an admirable start,
You can never underestimate
the work ethic
of somebody that comes
to this country
Congratulations
on a great start, Edna.
It's a great start.
Greiner:
Good luck, Edna.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I-I think my only point to her
was, at the end of the day,
entrepreneurism
has a risk,
Hi, my name
is Matt Richmond.
use pesticides, machinery,
or manual labor
to clean this mess up,
but you
probably don't know
there is an amazing
green alternative
See, that's a little
goat-industry joke.
You get it, Mark.
You see, goats
are simply a better way
to get
a tough job done,
plus these nimble little guys
Matt, you got to
tell us your story.
How does Matt
come into the picture?
So, we're bringing 450 goats
down to San Diego.
Um, in over five years --
our fifth year
we're gonna grow $600,000,
including additional
marketing from me,
which we don't have
right now.
What are you gonna do
your first year?
First year -- $200,000.
That's conservative,
based on $1,000 per day
at 450 goats.
I get it.
I'm a little confused.
Does the Rent a Goat business
actually exist today,
or is this a new idea?
So, Rent a Goat itself,
the website existed since 2010.
We help connect those wranglers
to the customers.
How much revenue have
you generated since 2010?
None.
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary: That's bad.
Matt, that's generally bad.
It's not bad.
I got to hear why
it's not bad.
Well, I thought that
you said
you did $600,000.
We got to start
Right.
It's got nothing
to do with Matt.
Aren't you two partners
coming in here?
We are.
Rent a Goat, llc.
in April.
Going forward.
We're starting
this location in San Diego.
What do I own
with my dough?
I write you a check,
what do I own?
You own 25%
of Rent a Goat, llc,
which is gonna be
our franchise,
our, um, corporate location
in San Diego.
Corcoran: But that doesn't
cover the goats.
Going to be, not today.
Look, I like
the business idea.
'Cause, right,
you're the first to the market,
so that gives you an edge,
but the problem is,
there's no barriers
to entry.
You're gonna convince them
to be decent managers,
to show up,
to bring their goats there,
to have the quality work
that you're gonna need
Matt, I admire
the -- the idea,
but the business plan is
a little bit all over the map.
I'm out.
I'm not gonna ride your herd
into the sunset with you.
I don't think this business
is proprietary at all.
I don't know what Matt brings
to the table, frankly.
We didn't quite
get the business model.
You know, we went too far
afield with the website,
which in the beginning
we knew was a minefield.
Yeah.
all on the line
for Veggie Mama.
I dropped out of law school.
We moved in with my parents.
My name is Teresa,
A.K.A. Veggie Mama.
We are the co-founders
of Veggie Mama
Veggie Mama has created
a delicious way
to sneak in those
essential nutrients.
When it comes
to snack time,
Veggie Mama garden pops
are frozen snacks
Agave's very expensive, so what
is it costing you to make this?
Each package
costs around $1.10.
There's six pops
per package.
by Sprouts Farmers Markets,
so we're in all 160 Sprouts.
Tell me the journey
to get to the start.
Like, what's
your background?
What -- what --
how do you make it?
What's the capacity?
How much more could you make?
We definitely have room
for more production.
Who's running
the machinery?
We are.
I am full-time.
I am working
full-time, yes.
He has a separate
job full time.
How much are you making
in your job right now?
$67,000.
Okay.
For $67,000,
I could buy you
as a full-time employee
for this business, right?
Absolutely.
Guys, I'm gonna simplify it
for the other sharks here.
Um, I hate the frozen-food
business.
It's gonna be so expensive
to take this nationwide.
I don't know
that you're ready for it.
You know,
I'll make you an offer.
I would give you
the $75,000.
is I'm gonna make 50 cents
off every unit sold
until I get
my capital back,
then it's gonna drop
to 25 cents.
I get no equity.
I've done this structure
other times with food.
I'd have you talk
to probably the people
that own wicked good cupcakes
'cause they're just like you.
You want half
of everything they make?
It'll be half
for about 5h months.
There's no product
like this.
You've got to go
with this.
My only concern is $75,000
isn't enough money
I'm going to make you
an offer.
I'm gonna give you
the $75,000,
it makes us want to
spice things up even more.
I may be coming back in 'cause
I'm getting so annoyed here.
No kidding, right?
You're getting
a lot of free advice here
from people who aren't
making you an offer.
They're not making an offer.
Why don't we go
knock them out?
