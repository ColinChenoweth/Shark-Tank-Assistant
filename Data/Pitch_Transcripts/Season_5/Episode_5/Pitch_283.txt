And I'm Mike Canaday,
the goat guy.
Our company
is Rent a Goat,
and we're seeking $150,000
for 25% of our company.

Sharks...
Rent a Goat is the answer
to a landscape disaster like
this -- an overgrown mess.
Now, usually
conventional landscapers
I teamed up with Mike,
who's been on the website
for over three years.
Mike grosses
over $600,000 a year.
He knows
what he's doing.
Renting goats?
Renting goats?
Renting goats.
Before he hooked up to you.
Yeah.
I'd like to understand how

How much

No, no, but that's
Mike's business.
We're getting confused 'cause
Mike has his own business.
It's totally dependent
on the Mikes of the world.
You're gonna locate them.
Mike has over 30 years
of experience in his field.
I'd be buying your equipment
within three months.

And I'd be giving you
less than half
what you paid for it.
[ Laughter ]
I'd be the goat shark.
The goat shark --
I like that.
Greiner: Bye, goats.
That Mike is so cool,
isn't he?
Herjavec: I love Mike.
Yeah.
I think
he's a classic rancher.
I liked Mike.
I didn't know about Matt's plan.
He was a little bit, uh --
