You've overvalued
your business.
That's the horror story
you've brought here.
You guys undervalued
your company
what valuation
is going to get interest,
but not underprice, because
if you need additional equity,
you've given away
too much.
I think you made
a strategic mistake,
significantly more valuable
than the 20-cent royalty
in perpetuity.
That was a mistake
on your part.
See, I'm
a financial advisor.
scaring the crap out of me
is your valuation.
So, $2 million
for 10%
imputes a $20-million value
on this scary-hayride business.
Tell us why
you're worth $20 million.
We do attractions
all year long.
We have the Los Angeles
Haunted Hayride,
which is our seasonal attraction
here in L.A.
17 nights -- we sell out
every single night.
We do about $1.8 million
right now per October.
Herjavec: Whoa!
Cuban: Really? Oh, wow.
$1.8 million
is really good.
In 17 days.
It's fantastic
in 17 days.
In 17 days.
You've overvalued
your business.
We've had major entertainment
companies in L.A.
who have already given us
offers to buy our company,
offered you
a $20-million valuation --
Cuban: You know what
the horror show is?
Listening to you argue
about valuation all the time.
Well, then, why don't you just
give her $2 million for 10%?
Does Val end up
at their door...
With a baseball bat?
...in the middle
of the night?
[ Laughter ]
saying,
"val, I'm so happy
that you were able
to get this to me,"
because we want to be able
to come through for them.
Look, I get it.
There's a value.
I'd actually rather see them
go through you
than take a loan
from the bank,
You know what it is?
You know, it's funny, val.
We were joking with you
about strong-arm tactics,
hold on. Can I explain how
we -- we got to the valuation?
No, they didn't ask --
instead of starting it
myself,
I'm giving up from day one
half the equity to you two guys.
That's the way
I look at it,
because if I want
to do this, I can.
I can do it myself, okay?
Cuban: See, in Kevin's defense,
the minute you guys walk out,
he takes out some ads, goes --
goes to a headhunting firm,
Val, who cares?
What are you gonna do?
$200,000, 50%.
What do you think
the probability is
that people
return my phone call?
Very high.
Thank you.
Go think about it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Whew.
Oh, boy.
You know,
they brought up a good point.
How many businesses
on "Shark Tank"
could use
a processing service like this?
A lot.
He's -- he's asking us
to give us --
our revenue, has tremendous
value, as well.
Reddish:
That's life, usually.
Reddish: Hey, is there any way
another shark
would get involved
at that deal?
$200,000, 50%,
100, 100.
My deal is very simple.
You know what it is.
Do you want me
to flip this coin,
or do you want
to say yes now?
I'll say...
I think
we should say yes.
Heads, we're your partner,
tails, we're your partner.
You got a deal.
[ Laughs ]
Aw, I wanted to see
the coin flip.
This is
my favorite coin.
Wow.
Both sides, I win.
Can I have that coin?
Would you mind?
This is
the first distribution.
Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations.
Reddish: Thanks.
Now, this is actually
the one business
Reddish: The definition
of a good deal
is when two people walk away
a little unhappy.
I think in this case
Mr. Wonderful
might have walked away
a little too happy.
But I guess
only time will tell
once we're on the cover
of Forbes magazine.
