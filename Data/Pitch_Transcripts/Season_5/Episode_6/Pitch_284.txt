I'm Melissa Carbone
from Los Angeles,
O'Leary: Okay, Melissa,
you know what's really
Carbone:
We have another attraction
called The Great Horror Campout
that we just launched,
which is a summer attraction.
The Great Horror Campout
is our way of not being
a seasonal company.
It is an overnight, completely
immersive camping experience --
horror themed.
Oh, no.
So, it's 12 hours.
We ba-- we take 2,000 campers,
we put them in tents,
Wow.
Carbone: That includes
everything from a hell hunt --
so, it's basically
summer camp from hell.
Yeah.
$1.8 million in at the end
of the 17 days. What's left?
It costs us $1.2 million
to produce the Los Angeles
Haunted Hayride.
So, I'm left with $600,000
free cash afterwards?
Yeah, I mean,
it varies year to year
because right now we're in a
launching-new-attraction mode.
We're launching a New York
Haunted Hayride,
which is what we're seeking
some of this money for.
The Great Horror Campout,
we're launching it next year
in 10 cities up the west coast.
Carbone: I am projecting for
the New York Haunted Hayride,
which hasn't happened yet --
'cause it's the same
model in L.A., we're
just plopping it there.
O'Leary: But you
haven't done it yet.
John: But hold on.
Cuban: Let her go,
let her go, let her go.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
But geographically
it's a different model
because it never rains
in L.A.
Listen, I-I-I-I don't agree
that your risk analysis
is correct.
It never happens
that everything you roll out
is successful day one.
That's ridiculous.
Carbone:
For me, it is not hard
to get lots of people
to come to the attractions.
The hard part is to make it
a great experience
so they want to come back.
Herjavec: Melissa, for you
to come close
to your projections
for next year,
everything has to work
perfectly all the time.
I don't see you getting
to those numbers next year.
I'm out.
For me right now
to give you $2 million,
I feel it would take
a really long time
for me to see
that back.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
[ Growling ]
Carbone:
The risk is not as great
as you probably would think.
I mean, we will launch these
attractions no matter what.
I know that we can
launch them faster.
By having this money,
we can launch them now.
I'm an expert
in high-octane scare.
You are?
Yes, I can tell you a way
to do this much cheaper.

Thank you so much,
you guys.
Cuban: Thanks, Melissa.
Appreciate it.
Greiner: Good luck.
John: I don't know what just
happened. Wait a minute.
I lost out on a deal,
come to think of it.
Yeah, you just did.
[ Snarls ]
I think that the
next generation of entertainment
is experiential
entertainment,
where people get out
of the house
