You've overvalued
your business.
That's the horror story
you've brought here.
Narrator: And the biggest deal
in "Shark Tank" history is made.
Stop the madness!
Tell us why
you're worth $20 million.
Narrator: In the tank,
hopeful entrepreneurs
get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks
in hopes of getting
an investment
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.
Now, what are
we gonna do?
Fiber Fix it!
Fiber Fix it!
Fiber Fix it!
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,
or they'll walk away
with nothing.
We're not crazy
about the deal, quite honestly.
Why are you
such a greedy pig?
If the sharks
hear a great idea...
Hyah!
Whoa!
...they're ready to invest
using their own money.
And they're willing
to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
I'm going to
offer you $250,000.
That's ridiculous.
You really need
the right partner to be with.
You guys undervalued
your company
and you realized it,
right?
Sure.
Cuban: That's part of the
game strategy of "Shark Tank."
You have to come in
and try to determine
what valuation
is going to get interest,
but not underprice, because
if you need additional equity,
you've given away
too much.
I think you made
a strategic mistake,
and for
those reasons, I'm out.
Herjavec: Well!
That's interesting.
Put on the gloves.
significantly more valuable
than the 20-cent royalty
in perpetuity.
That was a mistake
on your part.
See, I'm
a financial advisor.
I understand money.
Sounds like you don't.
[ Chuckles ]
But we do understand
growing a start-up,
scaring the crap out of me
is your valuation.
So, $2 million
for 10%
imputes a $20-million value
on this scary-hayride business.
Tell us why
you're worth $20 million.
We do attractions
all year long.
We have the Los Angeles
Haunted Hayride,
which is our seasonal attraction
here in L.A.
17 nights -- we sell out
every single night.
We do about $1.8 million
right now per October.
Herjavec: Whoa!
Cuban: Really? Oh, wow.
$1.8 million
is really good.
In 17 days.
It's fantastic
in 17 days.
In 17 days.
You've overvalued
your business.
We've had major entertainment
companies in L.A.
who have already given us
offers to buy our company,
and this is about
what they're valuing it.
Why are you
such a greedy pig?
Greiner: I --
[ laughs ] Kevin!
I'm not greedy.
I have lots of -- lots of
high hopes for the company.
And I want to grow fast.
Well -- well, let me ask
you something. Where --
where did this --
you're beating
a dead horse.
Just because
a Hollywood bozo
offered you
a $20-million valuation --
Cuban: You know what
the horror show is?
Listening to you argue
about valuation all the time.
Well, then, why don't you just
give her $2 million for 10%?
And my name
is Val Pinkhasov.
Our company
is total merchant resources.
We're seeking $200,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company.
One of the most frequent causes
of a failed business
is being
undercapitalized.
That's where total merchant
resources comes in,
because we're mini sharks.
It's like
looking in the mirror.
Every entrepreneur that walks
through these doors needs money.
But with this
financial meltdown,
it's been
virtually impossible
for businesses
to get their hands on money.
Just like
we're coming to you
for an investment
and a partnership,
we have responsible
business owners
coming to us daily
for similar reasons.
That's right.
Total merchant resources
provides alternative
financing solutions
so they can get the capital
they need quickly
to give their business
a shot in the arm.
So, with your help,
we want to expand our reach,
fund more
small businesses...
Both: And swim
with the big sharks.
Let's do it.
[ Laughter ]
You guys do get
the irony here, right?
Greiner:
Yeah, right?
Yeah,
you're competing.
Let's talk about
a typical loan.
Let's say
I own a dog-grooming --
well, first -- first,
is it loans --
is it loans or are --
'cause you said "underwriting."
That's
a great question.
It's loans.
It's not really a loan.
Semantically,
I mean, you could take --
you're taking equity.
We're not taking equity.
Well, let's say
you're a restaurant --
take an example.
I'm a dog groomer.
My sales are
$80,000 a year,
and I need another $20,000
so I can do more.
All right?
I can't get that from a bank.
I'm too small.
I come to tmr --
total merchant resources.
Both: That's right.
And I say
I need $20,000.
What are the terms under which
I get that $20,000?
If they qualify,
we'll give them $20,000.
What are the terms?
They will pay us back
on the $20,000
approximately $26,000
to $28,000,
depending on the risk
of their business.
What are the terms?
What's the annualized
interest rate?
What percentage?
Well, the --
there is no term.
What we do is we collect
a specific amount
of their credit-card sales
until we get paid back,
which is why there's no --
you're Kevin!
Which is why --
almost like a royalty.
Which is why
there's no term.
Because we're taking over
their credit-card processing.
Let's say the merchant
batches $1,000 tonight.
$800 is gonna hit
that merchant's account,
and $200 is gonna hit
our account
till we're paid back.
Now --
Cuban: I got it, I got it,
I got it. Okay.
So, you use
lending somebody money
as a foot in the door
to get their processing account.
It's ancillary --
it's an ancillary --
right. So, okay.
So, I would have
a restaurant,
and I need $50,000 to upgrade,
improve the restaurant,
whatever it may be.
Does Val end up
at their door...
With a baseball bat?
...in the middle
of the night?
[ Laughter ]
saying,
"val, I'm so happy
that you were able
to get this to me,"
because we want to be able
to come through for them.
Look, I get it.
There's a value.
I'd actually rather see them
go through you
than take a loan
from the bank,
because at least you guys
will care and work with them,
but it still makes me
feel uncomfortable.
You know, they always say
that when something goes wrong,
they go to
the deepest pockets.
And I'd be
your deepest pockets.
For that reason,
I'm out.
Daymond?
I'm out.
O'Leary: I happen to think
that what you do
is a necessary --
and some of these sharks
think -- it's a necessary evil.
It's still necessary
to keep a business afloat.
That's all that matters.
I'm gonna make
the assumption
that you were smart enough
to get in front of me
in "Shark Tank," that I should
be your partner.
But that will not happen
unless I have 50%.
Ba-bam.
Narrator: Four sharks are out.
You know what it is?
You know, it's funny, val.
We were joking with you
about strong-arm tactics,
and then you met
Mr. O'Leary
with the $200,000
for 50% offer.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah.
I just happen to think
I bring a tremendous amount
of credibility to this business
and capital and contacts,
and for me to ask
to be a 50/50 partner
is not unreasonable
in my view.
And so your dis-- distribution
just got cut in half.
Yeah, so, what you're
asking us to do
is basically take three years
of our life
and cut it
in a quarter.
I just put capital
in for $200,000.
You can't tell me right now
you're worth --
well, can I --
can I explain -- hold on.
The capital --
hold on. Can I explain how
we -- we got to the valuation?
No, they didn't ask --
instead of starting it
myself,
I'm giving up from day one
half the equity to you two guys.
That's the way
I look at it,
because if I want
to do this, I can.
I can do it myself, okay?
Cuban: See, in Kevin's defense,
the minute you guys walk out,
he takes out some ads, goes --
goes to a headhunting firm,
and says, "you know what?
Find me the best.
"And I'll pay them --
you know,
if it was that easy --
Cuban: And I'll pay them
$500,000 a year."
You got the best
in front of you.
Val, who cares?
What are you gonna do?
$200,000, 50%.
What do you think
the probability is
that people
return my phone call?
Very high.
Thank you.
Go think about it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Whew.
Oh, boy.
You know,
they brought up a good point.
How many businesses
on "Shark Tank"
could use
a processing service like this?
A lot.
He's -- he's asking us
to give us --
it's two times earnings,
and that's insane.
Right. Yeah.
You know, you really are
the right partner for it.
I think so, too.
I think they should
take your deal.
You're the only up here
that has that element.
You know, your only question is,
are these the guys
who are gonna take you
to the promised land?
our revenue, has tremendous
value, as well.
And granted,
those bar-- barriers to entry,
like you mentioned --
guys, I'm paying 10 times what
you put up to start this thing,
and there's no barriers
to entry.
Make a counter.
So we want to do $250,000
for 25% equity.
No. No.
Try to be
more reasonable than 50%.
If I put my name
on a business,
it's going to geometrically
increase the a.U.M. --
the assets under management.
If you don't believe that,
turn around,
walk out the door.
You can walk right out
of the Shark Tank
and you'll stay small.
Nobody
wants to bid for this?
You could always say, "I'm not
out." You've heard more.
John: Guys, guys, you got to
give this guy an answer.
Cuban: Got to
make a call, guys.
We got to stop
thinking about it.
It's binary.
Yes or no.
$200,000 at 40%?
Nope.
There is no flexibility,
my friend.
It's yes or no.
Binary. On or off.
There's
always flexibility.
There isn't.
I-if it was guaranteed
that we would
be blowing up?
Reddish:
That's life, usually.
Reddish: Hey, is there any way
another shark
would get involved
at that deal?
$200,000, 50%,
100, 100.
My deal is very simple.
You know what it is.
Do you want me
to flip this coin,
or do you want
to say yes now?
I'll say...
I think
we should say yes.
Heads, we're your partner,
tails, we're your partner.
You got a deal.
[ Laughs ]
Aw, I wanted to see
the coin flip.
This is
my favorite coin.
Wow.
Both sides, I win.
Can I have that coin?
Would you mind?
This is
the first distribution.
Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations.
Reddish: Thanks.
Now, this is actually
the one business
where you put up a little money
and you hire somebody,
you could replicate it.
I could have.
But what I like is they've got
an existing book,
and they're probably
good foot soldiers.
My man!
Whoo!
Whoo!
[ Both laugh ]
Rear naked choke
on the counter.
Reddish: The definition
of a good deal
is when two people walk away
a little unhappy.
I think in this case
Mr. Wonderful
might have walked away
a little too happy.
But I guess
only time will tell
once we're on the cover
of Forbes magazine.
