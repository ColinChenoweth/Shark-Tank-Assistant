I'm Melissa Carbone
from Los Angeles,
and my company
is Ten Thirty One Productions,
and I'm seeking $2 million
in exchange
for 10% of my company.
Oh.
Wow.
Ten Thirty One Productions
is an entertainment company
that creates, owns,
and produces
live attractions
in the horror space.
Our most popular attraction
is the Los Angeles
Haunted Hayride.
And it is
not for the faint of heart.
Sharks,
when you take our hayride,
you are entering
the pitch black woods.
Where demonic forces,
lost souls,
psychopathic fun
are waiting around every turn.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Oh, God.
Cuban:
Let's hope he bites.
[ Screeches ]
And just when you think
the terror is over,
think again.
Oh, God.
[ Laughs ]
[ Hisses ]
[ Chainsaw revs ]
Oh!
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: Oh, my God!
Cuban: He likes you.
Don't eyeball me.
I will kick your tush
back to Texas.
Greiner: Get him, mark!
Get him!
O'Leary: Okay, Melissa,
you know what's really
Carbone:
We have another attraction
called The Great Horror Campout
that we just launched,
which is a summer attraction.
The Great Horror Campout
is our way of not being
a seasonal company.
It is an overnight, completely
immersive camping experience --
horror themed.
Oh, no.
So, it's 12 hours.
We ba-- we take 2,000 campers,
we put them in tents,
and we have an incredibly
interactive experience.
Cuban: Oh.
That sounds amazing.
Wow.
Carbone: That includes
everything from a hell hunt --
so, it's basically
summer camp from hell.
Yeah.
$1.8 million in at the end
of the 17 days. What's left?
It costs us $1.2 million
to produce the Los Angeles
Haunted Hayride.
So, I'm left with $600,000
free cash afterwards?
Yeah, I mean,
it varies year to year
because right now we're in a
launching-new-attraction mode.
We're launching a New York
Haunted Hayride,
which is what we're seeking
some of this money for.
The Great Horror Campout,
we're launching it next year
in 10 cities up the west coast.
Cuban: And therein lies
the rub, right?
Because they're very, very, very
expensive to produce and create.
Right, well, the -- the campouts
are cheap to produce.
Cuban: How much advertising
and promotion do you do?
We spend about $300,000.
We do a ton of radio.
My background is
I-I ran Clear Channel
Los Angeles for 10 years,
so my advertising, marketing,
and one of --
wow.
And my other business partner
is actually
still with Clear Channel.
So we know how to make
a dollar go really far
from a marketing standpoint.
How many unique individuals
come through?
The hayride?
Yeah.
We have --
we have 50,000 people.
We sell out
every single night.
So, this year
is our first year
we increased our max capacity
to 100,800.
We actually are doubling
our max capacity this year
'cause we've --
you -- you sell out
every night for 17 days?
Every night.
Herjavec:
That's amazing.
So, can I extrapolate
and say
that it's gonna be $3.6 million
in revenue this year?
Yes, if we sell out.
So, that means
this thing will generate
just over a million bucks
if everything works, right?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Now, you're
an intelligent woman.
I'm trying
to make the leap now.
We have to get back to reality
and your $20-million ask.
Yeah.
Let's give you
a fair chance
of making a million bucks
before tax, okay?
Yeah. Yep.
That's about
$700,000 after tax.
If I gave you
a 10 multiple,
you're worth
7 million bucks.
How is it that I am going
to pay $20 million
for a $7-million
business?
If everything
goes right.
That's the horror story
you've brought here.
Carbone: I am projecting for
the New York Haunted Hayride,
which hasn't happened yet --
'cause it's the same
model in L.A., we're
just plopping it there.
O'Leary: But you
haven't done it yet.
John: But hold on.
Cuban: Let her go,
let her go, let her go.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
But geographically
it's a different model
because it never rains
in L.A.
Listen, I-I-I-I don't agree
that your risk analysis
is correct.
It never happens
that everything you roll out
is successful day one.
That's ridiculous.
Carbone:
For me, it is not hard
to get lots of people
to come to the attractions.
The hard part is to make it
a great experience
so they want to come back.
Look, this is
all fun and games,
but we're talking
about money here.
I can't --
I can't get there.
I'm out.
Herjavec: Melissa, for you
to come close
to your projections
for next year,
everything has to work
perfectly all the time.
I don't see you getting
to those numbers next year.
I'm out.
For me right now
to give you $2 million,
I feel it would take
a really long time
for me to see
that back.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
[ Growling ]
Carbone:
The risk is not as great
as you probably would think.
I mean, we will launch these
attractions no matter what.
I know that we can
launch them faster.
By having this money,
we can launch them now.
I'm an expert
in high-octane scare.
You are?
Yes, I can tell you a way
to do this much cheaper.
Wear a piece of jewelry
and walk around
where I grew up.
[ Laughter ]
That will give you
a high-octane scare.
Fair enough.
Uh, I would just have to
insult you with my offer.
Um...
Go ahead. Insult her.
That's about what it's worth.
Throw the offer.
Yeah.
Okay, well, then, I'll give you
$2 million for 40%.
Cuban: [ Scoffs ]
Okay.
Mark?
Come on, Mark.
Is that a yes
or a no to him?
Um...
Can I counter?
Of course
you can counter.
Um, $2 million for 20%.
I'll take that offer.
Done.
Really?
Yep.
Greiner: Awesome!
Go, Mark!
So, we have a deal?
John: Take it.
All right.
We have a deal.
Whoo-hoo!
Wow!
Easy, breezy.
I love it.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm so excited.
Thanks.
Don't
think about it.
Herjavec: Wow, Daymond.
Buttered her up for Mark.
Holy cow!
You owe me 5%
for helping you on that.
Totally.
You can have free tickets
to the L.A. Haunted Hayride.
Thank you so much,
you guys.
Cuban: Thanks, Melissa.
Appreciate it.
Greiner: Good luck.
John: I don't know what just
happened. Wait a minute.
I lost out on a deal,
come to think of it.
Yeah, you just did.
[ Snarls ]
I think that the
next generation of entertainment
is experiential
entertainment,
where people get out
of the house
and go and get
a unique experience.
I thought for me
to get my money back
if I did that deal
for $2 mil,
I'd have to rise from the dead
and look like that
before I get anything.
You already have,
Kevin.
Are we excited?
Are we excited?
[ Screeching ]
With mark on board
and $2 million,
this is
the biggest deal ever.
I'm so excited.
This changes
the game for us.
[ Chainsaw revs ]
Wow!
Narrator: Next into the tank
are self-described mini sharks
from New Jersey with a unique
opportunity for the sharks.
