Thanks, Lori.
Stop singing my praises.
Eric -- Eric --
I'll give you
$2 million for 40%.
Wow!
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?
Hi, sharks.
I'm Eric Child.
Child:
Even broken furniture.
This stool
was broken in two places.
Child: Sharks, Fiber Fix
is taking off.
So who's ready to...
Fiber Fix it!
Fiber Fix it!
[ Laughter ]
Very good.
Herjavec: Spencer, let me
ask you a question.
How many of these
are we selling right now?!
Over $100,000
worth of product.
In what
period of time?
In the last few months.
We actually --
Quinn: You just take it
out of the pouch.
You dip it in water,
Child: Well, you're not
gonna want to
because it's -- it's --
it's really sticky,
All right, Eric,
I would be your biggest customer
in a single race weekend
on my racecar
using this tape stuff.
[ Laughs ]
Um, I'll give you
the $90,000 for 10%.
Eric,
one of my best friends
runs a $16-billion
home hardware company.
Really?
Yeah.
I go over to his house,
there is duct tape everywhere.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: What if you want to
get it off of something?
How does it remove?
It's tough.
I'm gonna be honest.
It's not coming off.
Eric, why are we
having this discussion?
Let's go sell
some Fiber Fix!
[ Laughter ]
You've got
two offers here.
There's
still questions.
Are there
any other offers here?
Child: We want to hear
from the rest of the sharks,
but before we do,
we want to just alert you
to one other development
in the business.
Um, we recently have received
a purchase order from QVC.
Ah.
You mean there's someone else
on QVC that sells product?
I'm shocked!
It's an opening
test order.
John: Are you definitely
going on to QVC with this?
We're definitely
going on.
We're going on.
If you're already committed
to QVC, I'm out.
I have a deal with HSN.
Thanks, Lori.
Stop singing my praises.
Eric --
Eric, who is --
they know
nothing about it.
Eric, who is the biggest buyer
for this product?
Is it men or women?
We believe
it's probably men.
O'Leary:
I don't think a lot of women
are gonna be
applying this.
I think it's both.
Herjavec:
So, where do you think -- where
do you think most guys shop?
Herjavec: Eric, let me just add
a condition to my offer.
Okay.
I think what you really need
is you need some of the money
Child: Lori, what we'd like
to offer
is $120,000
for 12% in the company,
plus a $2-million
line of credit.
Guys, come on.
I mean, seriously.
Guys, you're --
now you're blowing it.
Whoa. So, wow.
Eric, is the infomercial route
the way you want to go?
We just feel like
that's a very important
component of this product.
It's a great product.
Child:
It is a great product.
[ Sighs ]
Greiner: All right.
Thanks, guys.
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Right on, baby!
I would have
never done that.
being able to keep shellbobbers
made in America.
To be able to provide jobs
in our hometown
has just been
really cool to see.
Perfect. Ready to go.
Stafford: Thank you.
Before "Shark Tank," we had less
than $1,000 in sales.
After making our deal
with mark,
we're in the largest retailer
in the world, 7-Eleven.
Now we're projecting
over $1 million in sales
over the next
12 months.
It's two pallets.
Two pallets, yeah.
I can have that out
by Thursday.
The experience has been a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
