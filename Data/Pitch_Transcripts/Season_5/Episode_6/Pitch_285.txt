Thanks, Lori.
Stop singing my praises.
Eric -- Eric --
I'll give you
$2 million for 40%.
Wow!
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Daymond John is a fashion
and branding expert
who grew
his homemade clothing line
into the globally recognized
fashion brand Fubu,
with over $6 billion
in retail sales to date.
Robert Herjavec, the son
of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
who sold his first Internet
companies for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents
and has launched
over 300 products,
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.
And Mark Cuban -- notorious
billionaire entrepreneur,
tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
are entrepreneurs from Utah
who are hoping their product
will become an everyday
household fix-it tool.
Hi, sharks.
I'm Eric Child.
And I'm Spencer Quinn.
And we are Fiber Fix.
Fiber Fix?
Fiber Fix!
[ Laughter ]
Fiber Fix!
We're looking for $90,000
for 10% of our company.
Fiber Fix is the world's
strongest repair wrap.
In fact, it is 100 times
stronger than duct tape.
To show you
just how strong it is,
we created this beautiful hammer
made of 2x2s
wrapped together
with Fiber Fix.
This awesome hammer
is so strong...
Ahh.
...that it can break through
cinder block.
Herjavec:
I don't believe it!
[ Laughs ]
You're gonna believe it.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Ooh.
Whoa!
Stop the madness!
And it gets better.
Fiber Fix saves you
time and money,
and now you can fix things
that you could not fix before.
And you can fix things
with less money.
Leaky pipe?
Fiber Fix it!
Broken tool handles?
Fiber Fix it.
Cracked
your hockey stick?
Okay, everyone say it
with me now.
What are we gonna do?
Fiber Fix it!
Fiber Fix it!
Fiber Fix it!
Child:
Even broken furniture.
This stool
was broken in two places.
Just wrapped it, sanded it,
painted it -- Fiber Fix!
And, now, sharks,
I'd like you
to take a look
at these samples
that we have here
of the product.
Thank you.
There you go, Robert.
Greiner: Thank you.
Kevin.
Child: Sharks, Fiber Fix
is taking off.
So who's ready to...
Fiber Fix it!
Fiber Fix it!
[ Laughter ]
Very good.
Herjavec: Spencer, let me
ask you a question.
How many of these
are we selling right now?!
Over $100,000
worth of product.
In what
period of time?
In the last few months.
We actually --
so, it's brand-new.
It's brand-new.
Why is this better
than duct tape?
Well, why don't we show you
a little demo?
Here's a tent pole
that's been repaired
with duct tape.
Doesn't quite cut it.
Here's a snapped
tent pole
that's been repaired
with Fiber Fix.
Let me see it.
This is incredible.
Yeah. It's awesome,
right?
Greiner:
Let me feel it.
Incredible.
It's a specialized blend
of resin,
along with
industrial-grade fibers.
Cuban: What's the process
to make it work?
I buy it,
and then what do I do?
Quinn: You just take it
out of the pouch.
You dip it in water,
and that activates
the resin that's in the tape.
So it's
water-activated.
You wrap it around
the broken item,
and after
about five minutes,
it's gonna start
to harden.
You have to put it
in water, and you have to --
you -- you can't touch it
with your bare hands?
Child: Well, you're not
gonna want to
because it's -- it's --
it's really sticky,
and once you
get that on your hands,
it's gonna be there
for awhile.
Now, that's
sticky right now.
So, what do you
charge me for this?
So, we sell it
in three different sizes.
Um, the, uh, four-inch
costs $9.99,
the two-inch
costs $7.99,
and the one-inch
costs $5.99.
So, what's your cost?
The average cost
is under $2, landed.
Yours. And what do you
wholesale it for?
For $4.
Greiner: So, where are you
selling right now?
We're in over 400 independent
retailers right now,
but we are now set up
as a vendor with home depot,
and we have a P.O. Coming
for a 240-store test.
O'Leary: You know,
I'll make you an offer.
Very simply -- I give you
the $90,000, I take no equity.
You keep your company.
You pay me back,
every time you sell a unit,
70 cents, until I get
the $90,000 back.
I don't know
how long it's gonna take.
And then after
I get the $90,000 back,
you pay me 20 cents
in perpetuity.
And then you take
your children,
and they have to work
for him forever.
[ Laughs ]
All right, Eric,
I would be your biggest customer
in a single race weekend
on my racecar
using this tape stuff.
[ Laughs ]
Um, I'll give you
the $90,000 for 10%.
Straight in, no royalty,
and we're in this together.
O'Leary: Giving up equity
right at the beginning
can be very expensive
later on.
Eric,
one of my best friends
runs a $16-billion
home hardware company.
Really?
Yeah.
I go over to his house,
there is duct tape everywhere.
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: What if you want to
get it off of something?
How does it remove?
It's tough.
I'm gonna be honest.
It's not coming off.
Eric, why are we
having this discussion?
Let's go sell
some Fiber Fix!
[ Laughter ]
You've got
two offers here.
There's
still questions.
Are there
any other offers here?
Child: We want to hear
from the rest of the sharks,
but before we do,
we want to just alert you
to one other development
in the business.
Um, we recently have received
a purchase order from QVC.
Ah.
You mean there's someone else
on QVC that sells product?
I'm shocked!
It's an opening
test order.
John: Are you definitely
going on to QVC with this?
We're definitely
going on.
We're going on.
If you're already committed
to QVC, I'm out.
I have a deal with HSN.
Okay. We understand.
Thanks, Daymond.
Greiner: I will tell you
what I think here.
That QVC disease
has affected this product.
[ Laughs ]
That QVC will probably
make them very wealthy.
Here's my offer.
I'm going to offer you
$250,000 for 18%,
and I'll tell you why.
One, I know
the power of QVC,
but I also know the power
of QVC when you're with me.
But I think another
huge opportunity here
is the infomercial-spot
market.
Right.
I'll tell you honestly,
you really need
the right partner.
You need somebody
who knows the ropes
and who also knows who are
the good partners to be with.
Thanks, Lori.
Stop singing my praises.
Eric --
Eric, who is --
they know
nothing about it.
Eric, who is the biggest buyer
for this product?
Is it men or women?
We believe
it's probably men.
O'Leary:
I don't think a lot of women
are gonna be
applying this.
I think it's both.
Herjavec:
So, where do you think -- where
do you think most guys shop?
Do you think they shop
online and infomercials,
or do you think
they shop
in a hardware store
with this other stuff?
He's wrong.
Well, there's a lot
of women on --
no, you know, I can immediately
tell you he's wrong.
Any -- any shark --
but all --
any shark can get you
into the infomercial business.
It takes --
that's not true at all.
It is true.
It's -- it is true.
That is true.
That is true.
Greiner: You know he has
no experience about it.
They can get you in.
I actually
produce these things.
But they can get you in
with the wrong partners.
We're concerned about,
you know,
if it goes well,
now you've got
to put $1 million, $2 million,
$3 million --
Greiner: That's -- that's
exactly the point.
Yeah, but the media-buyer --
media-buyer partners
will -- will do that.
How are you guys gonna pay
for the infomercials?
$90,000
isn't gonna do it.
$120,000
isn't gonna do it.
As usual, all roads
lead back to me
because I don't require
any equity in my deal.
I actually don't think
this product
is a, uh -- is the same
as costume jewelry or sponges.
Lori, she made you an offer
of $250,000 for 18%.
That's a lot of equity
to give up early on, of course.
My deal's
so simple for you.
And you give up
no equity.
Robert offered you
exactly what you wanted --
$90,000 for 10%.
Herjavec: Let me
tell you why, Kevin.
$16-billion hardware
retailer with 1,000 locations --
this is the path to go.
There's nothing wrong
with the infomercial,
but I'm telling you
that is not the path
of least resistance to start.
That's
a supplement market.
What's missing
in my offer?
Well, you know
that you need
a strategic partner
that can you take you farther.
Is it
infomercial?
Herjavec: Eric, let me just add
a condition to my offer.
Okay.
I think what you really need
is you need some of the money
to do some development
and other stuff,
but you also need some money
for inventory.
I'll give you the $90,000
for the 10%
and I'll extend you
a $250,000 line of credit
as you need it.
But any of us
can do that, too.
Robert, it sounds
like you've got
some great retail connections
that we could definitely use.
And, Lori, it sounds
like you've got
some great connections
that we could definitely use
in the TV realm.
Can we take a minute?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
[ Clears throat ]
I don't see equity being
worth anything in this
company. It's a product.
Cuban: Yeah, well,
they underpriced it.
They underpriced it.
It's worth a lot more.
They underpriced it, and they
know they underpriced it.
So, Robert offered 10%.
Exactly
what we want.
Just what we wanted.
$90,000.
$250,000
in a line of credit.
$250,000 -- I don't think
that's enough line of credit.
John:
I'm just curious, Lori,
do you really think
that women are going to want
to put on the gloves
and do all of the --
Daymond, you know
a lot of products like this
sell very successfully
on QVC.
The women buy it
for their husband.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Thanks
for your patience.
Uh, we feel like we need
a big line of credit
as part of the deal.
So, Lori, what we'd like
to offer
is $120,000
for 12% in the company,
plus a $2-million
line of credit.
O'Leary: Oh.
Guys, come on.
I mean, seriously.
Guys, you're --
now you're blowing it.
Narrator: One shark is out,
but with interest
from three sharks,
Spencer and Eric
have changed their offer.
Child: Lori, what we'd like
to offer
is $120,000
for 12% in the company,
plus a $2-million
line of credit.
Guys, come on.
I mean, seriously.
Guys, you're --
now you're blowing it.
Whoa. So, wow.
So, Eric, what are you saying
to my offer and Kevin's offer?
So, with your offer,
Robert --
you're countering
to all three sharks?
We also need the $2-million
line of credit from you.
And what are you saying
to Kevin?
Kevin.
Pound of salt.
We didn't -- we didn't actually
consider that deal much.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah! I like these guys.
We feel like that would
be counterproductive to
the business.
A lot of the cash would be
going out the back door.
Well, if you actually
thought it through,
if you did $100 million
in sales,
my deal would be
much better for you,
'cause your equity
would actually be
and we really need that cash
to grow this business fast.
Herjavec: Eric.
Are we still
talking to Kevin?
[ Laughs ]
Greiner: I'll do the $120,000
for the 12%.
That's it.
I'm not gonna give you
the $2-million line of credit.
If we're doing well,
I'll definitely put up the money
to help fund any orders
that we have
until the money
is rolling in enough
where you can put
the money back into it.
Cuban:
But there's a huge difference
between a line of credit,
which allows you to borrow
to use for any business purpose,
and funding purchase orders.
But your concern is funding
purchase orders, correct?
Yeah, of course.
Eric, is the infomercial route
the way you want to go?
We just feel like
that's a very important
component of this product.
Because it's brand-new,
we need to educate consumers.
So let me -- let me
clear it up then.
You got to get
into retail first.
Well, we definitely want to
do that, as well.
There's no point
in advertising
unless the product's
out there.
Right.
I'm out.
Well, now that Robert's out,
I'm the only game in town.
Yeah, we're not crazy
about the deal, quite honestly.
And I really think
that the line of credit
is important
to the business.
Wow!
Greiner: Why --
why did you need
the $2-million credit
if it's not
to fund purchase orders?
'Cause it's extremely expensive
to get on TV.
Did you guys come in
genuinely wanting
to close a deal?
Sure. We did. Yeah.
Because you do know
what I can offer,
and basically I'm giving you
what you asked for...
Herjavec: Eric, you -- no.
...except I'm not saying,
"here's just a $2-million
line of credit
for whatever
you want to do with it."
Sure.
I'm saying that I would
fund purchase orders.
Guys, now you're
getting greedy.
So, Lori, $120,000 for 12%,
finance all purchase orders.
I said --
I already said that.
Right?
Yep.
That's a partnership.
We need a decision.
Lori...
You have a deal.
Good.
Thank God.
John: Thank goodness.
O'Leary: Oh, my gosh.
[ Laughter ]
It's a great product.
Child:
It is a great product.
[ Sighs ]
Greiner: All right.
Thanks, guys.
Uh-huh. Good luck.
Right on, baby!
I would have
never done that.
I felt like they were the sharks
and you were pitching them.
You know what?
You guys!
It's disgusting
how much you criticize
when I'm the winner
and you're the loser.
Narrator: Last season,
Jeff Stafford and Dusty Holloway
made a deal with Mark Cuban
for their product, Shellbobbers,
fishing bobbers
made from shotgun shells.
Deal? Done.
Yes. We will
accept your offer.
Narrator: Let's see
how they're doing now.
Stafford: Business has been
awesome since "Shark Tank."
It feels like I'm on
a roller coaster
that's going, like,
3,000 miles an hour.
After landing our deal,
we knew we had to scale quickly.
We moved into
a 3,500-square-foot facility,
hired a team of employees,
and brought in the automation
we needed
to pump these things
out quick.
I went from making 100 a day
to 25,000 every day.
Cool. Cool.
Got it.
All right?
Thanks, man.
It feels really good
being able to keep shellbobbers
made in America.
To be able to provide jobs
in our hometown
has just been
really cool to see.
Perfect. Ready to go.
Stafford: Thank you.
Before "Shark Tank," we had less
than $1,000 in sales.
After making our deal
with mark,
we're in the largest retailer
in the world, 7-Eleven.
Now we're projecting
over $1 million in sales
over the next
12 months.
It's two pallets.
Two pallets, yeah.
I can have that out
by Thursday.
The experience has been a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
and it's all thanks
to "Shark Tank."
All: Thank you, "Shark Tank"!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
