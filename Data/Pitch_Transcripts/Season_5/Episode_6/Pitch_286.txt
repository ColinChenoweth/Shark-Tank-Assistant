I'm Amanda Adams.
I'm Jason Adams.
And we're
from Mckinney, Texas.
Amanda and I met a year ago
on a blind date.
We fell in love and got married
within six weeks.
We both had kids,
so we blended
our families together,
and now we're expecting
a baby boy.
Combining two
already-established families
is difficult
and takes a lot of work.
You've got to find
a good way to communicate.
But if we put that
like that?
That could work.
We developed
a product
to save marriages
and relationships.
It was born out of love
to help couples like us
communicate our thoughts
and feelings,
even when it's tough.
We know people.
We know relationships.
Manufacturing,
price points, and margins
are not
our strong points.
This is where the sharks
can really help us.
We need to make
this deal.
We've invested over $100,000
to make our dream a reality.
And we feel
very passionate
that this can help save
millions of relationships.
Hello, sharks.
I'm Jason.
I'm Amanda.
This is baby Koa.
And we are
the Adams family.
Our company
is Elephant Chat,
and we're seeking
a $50,000 investment
for a 20% stake
in our company.
No one likes those "we need
to talk" conversations.
But they are
necessary.
And most of the time,
you don't know that you
need to have that talk
until you start getting
the cold shoulder
and end up
sleeping on the couch.
Until now.
We designed a product
that allows you
to visually tell
your partner
you have something
to talk about.
Introducing
the elephant in the room.
John: Oh, lord.
[ Laughter ]
Is that
a stuffed animal?
It is
a stuffed elephant.
So, when I see the toilet seat
has been left up
for the millionth time,
I don't have to be ready
to pounce on him
when he walks
through the door
or be mad when he doesn't
realize I'm upset.
I simply remove
the cover
and reveal the elephant
in the room.
So, when I get home and I see
the elephant is in the room,
I immediately know
that she has something
she wants
to talk about,
which allows me
to understand her mood,
but gives me time
to settle in.
Then when I'm ready,
I simply say,
"you want to talk about
the elephant in the room?"
And one of the best rules
about Elephant Chat
is that you can only talk
if you're holding the elephant.
So, which one
of you sharks
would like to be the first
to talk about
the elephant
in the room?
Oh. Lord.
Amanda,
how long you been married?
Um, well, actually, today
is our 13th-month anniversary.
Is one of you
a therapist?
We are not.
What we landed on
was this worked for us.
John: If you're
really married --
and they
obviously are.
Yeah, you know
the rules.
There's
one person right
and the other person's
the husband.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.
That's it.
Th-there's -- there's --
there's nothing to discuss.
[ Laughter ]
So, how much
does each one cost to make?
To make -- on our very first run
of 500, it was $22.
Whoa!
Oh, my goodness.
Whoa! Each?
Whoa!
Greiner: You know,
can I see the box, 'cause I --
O'Leary: You have to sell the --
the elephant for 150 bucks!
Jason, what do you sell
the elephant for?
$59 is what
we're looking at.
[ Laughs ]
How much money did you put
to start the business?
Okay.
We -- we raised $100,000.
Raised?
We have seven -- we just --
our local friends.
[ Laughter ]
They won't be friends
for long.
Greiner:
You guys, the thing is,
like, a stuffed elephant animal
is very inexpensive to make.
That's correct.
It costs you
a lot of money
to go into that box
with tooling,
so, to make the decision
and spend that much money
when you're a brand-new business
is a wonderment to me,
because that's a risk
and it's a big expense.
You know what?
The -- the finances actually
worked out the best for us,
'cause, as we started
to look
at all the other boxes
that existed out there,
there wasn't another way
to get a clear plastic
inside of a covered plastic.
But, Jason, just staying
on theme here for a second...
Yes.
...I go online,
I click on stuffed elephants.
Here's one for $2.99.
Here's one for $69.
That's right.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: $59.
I get exactly
what you're saying.
The -- the issue here,
is that says,
every single person
has -- has something
that they really
want to say.
Can I have the elephant?
Yes.
Thank you.
When you
first start out,
one -- you do it
as inexpensively
as you possibly can,
because you don't know
if this will succeed.
Two -- I think
it's very important
to offer something
at a very affordable price.
It wasn't
gonna work for me,
for her
to take it serious
that I wanted to build
better communications
if it was $19.99
for two of them
and I got a free snuggie
with it.
But, you guys,
at $60 apiece,
I don't think
it would ever sell.
I'm out.
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Lori.
So, our first strategy
is that we've
made relationships and inroads
with the marriage
counseling
and other counseling
industries, so --
[ laughs ]
You're kidding.
O'Leary: You got to be
kidding.
I would buy that box
for $60,
open it up, and find
a $1 stuffed elephant in it.
If your phone number
was in there...
[ Laughter ]
...you can sell me
some tickets
to an anger-management show,
because I would be very unhappy.
The consumer experience
of getting completely
ripped off blind
is going to be
an unpleasant one.
Well --
and -- and for
that reason, Jason,
um, I'm definitely out.
Okay.
My wife gets really mad
at me sometimes.
I don't know why,
'cause I'm the perfect husband.
Right.
I'm just picturing
going to her
with a little stuffed animal
and saying,
"honey,
don't yell at me."
I don't know
if that's gonna work.
Well -- well,
from the marriage counselors
that we've talked to,
they love the idea,
because right now,
they use this method,
but they use it with pencils
and random objects.
Amanda, you've been married
for 13 months.
Come talk to me
after 23 years.
Right.
Okay?
I'm out.
Daymond.
We still have
$53,000 in cash.
We own
three injection molds,
and we have
the first 500 units.
Um, if I came home,
this would be
an early warning signal.
I would
slide out the window
and hop the back gate
and go to a bar
and not come home
until the next day...
Exactly.
...because this would mean that,
"honey, we have to talk."
Maybe that's why
you're not married.
Maybe.
This just isn't for me.
I'm out.
We appreciate it.
Thank you.
I --
I think mark may --
mark may be in on this one.
Cuban: First -- first, I think
these guys are all wrong.
Okay? I think the product
should be more expensive.
You guys are in the
conflict-resolution business.
Jason:
That's right.
Now, trying to sell this
in a retail environment --
isn't gonna work.
Forget it, right?
And that -- that wasn't
our focus.
You go to
the marriage counselors
with the 500 units
that you have,
and this is
a conflict-resolution device --
there's nobody who needs
corny stuff
more than
marriage counselors.
Right.
Mark, what are
you gonna do?
I can't go in 'cause you guys
aren't where you need to be yet.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you very much
for your time.
O'Leary: All right, guys.
Congratulations.
Good luck.
John: Congratulations.
Thank you. Congratulations.
Good luck with the baby.
Thank you.
We know this works.
We know how it worked
for us and our marriage.
And everyone
we talk to loves it.
And, so, we're gonna
continue to go forward.
Yeah.
Love you.
Love you.
[ Snarling ]
Narrator: Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur
who believes there's big money
to be made from big scares.
Oh.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
Everywhere I go,
there's zombies.
Hi, sharks.
Hello, sharks.
My name is Jason Reddish.
And I go to you guys
and say, "yo, Jason."
"Jason, what's up?"
"I need a little bit
of cash here.
You know, these banks,
they ain't giving me nothing."
Is my accent that bad?
"Yeah, nothing, right?
They ain't givin' me nothing."
I've taken
speech classes.
[ Laughs ]
"You say,
$50,000, mark."
"Fitty"? "Fitty"?
"Fitty" thousand.
"Mark, I got you.
"You're doing
a million in revenue.
Where -- you just switch your
credit-card processing to us."
Wink, wink.
"We're gonna take 6% off your
sales or whatever it may be,
"and when you're paid off,
you're paid off,
"and, oh, by the way,
we do credit-card processing
better than anybody," right?
Cuban: Am I right on that?
We take over 74% --
John: Is he right?
74% of the business
that we have coming in,
we take over
the processing.
Jason, Val,
what's your background?
Are you finance guys?
I owned a-a decent-size
mortgage company
for about 10 years.
And what's
your background?
And I was in mortgage sales
for awhile.
I ran offices.
About six years ago,
I actually interviewed
at Jason's office
for a management position,
and I was hired.
What are your sales?
In 2012, we did $364,000
in gross sales, okay?
Our take-home on that
was about $220,000
in distributions.
So, what we need
from you sharks, okay,
is to be able
to introduce us
to the bigger credit-card
processing accounts,
because that's the only
component of this business
that requires
the who-you-know factor.
Herjavec: But where are you
gonna get the float?
Where are you
gonna get the extra cash?
Well, I'm -- I'm getting
to that, right?
So, once we get the credit-card
processing accounts
on board
through your connections,
those accounts throw off
a very nice-size residual.
Jason, Kevin's example
of the dog groomer --
if someone's doing $80,000
a year and they need 20 grand,
there's no way
that business could afford
to pay you back
in 12 months.
It could. It could.
So, we already have
a successful track record.
We only started
with $5,000, okay?
That $5,000 has grown over time
to be worth over $100,000.
Greiner: You guys, I'm not
really sure about all of this,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
Okay.
I -- a tanning salon
in bayside, queens. All right?
Air-conditioning unit
blows on --
hey, I went to
bayside high.
A guy needs $18,000
to fix his hvac
on his roof, right?
How long does it take
a guy running a tanning salon
to get $18,000 together
to fix the thing on the roof?
Herjavec: Never.
Right.
If I'm not there,
he's out of business.
Yeah.
We get him funded
in three or four days.
Herjavec:
All right, Jason, look,
there is an entire subset
of small businesses
that cannot get a loan,
but it -- it's
not a market for me.
This isn't a business
that I would want to be in.
I'm out.
Even though
there's a 400% return
in less than a year,
two years?
That's a pretty --
I mean, it's -- we have
a successful track record.
Cuban: But, guys,
that's part of the problem.
That -- that -- that's
the upside and the downside.
The risk
is government, right?
Right now,
there aren't limitations,
but it's almost
like payday loans,
until they got so popular
people started to complain,
and then
the government stepped in
and started to introduce
regulations.
We have testimonials --
no joke --
where clients were actually
crying on the phone
Kevin is Jason and Val's
last chance for a deal.
O'Leary: I'm gonna make
the assumption
that you were smart enough
to get in front of me
in "Shark Tank," that I should
be your partner.
But that will not happen
unless I have 50%.
Ba-bam.
I'll give you $200,000
to be 50% partner
in this business.
And I'll probably take you
to a whole new level.
There's no question
about it.
I have access to capital
you only dream of.
Jason, Val,
welcome back to the tank.
Kevin made you an offer --
$200,000 for 50%.
You know, Kevin,
we feel that our sales,
Jason, come on.
There are no --
there's no guarantees.
You -- you know
whether or not --
why don't you guys
just flip a coin?
Just get it over with.
Just flip a coin.
Flip a coin?
Yeah,
if it means that --
Come on, Jason. You know
what you want to do.
[ Sighs ]
You got to make a decision.
Got a coin?
[ Laughs ]
I'll let you
flip a coin. That's fine.
Kevin, Kevin.
I got a quarter.
