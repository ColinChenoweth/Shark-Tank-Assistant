Hi, my name
is Solomon Fallas,
Narrator: Solomon is seeking
$300,000 for 15% of his company,
but Daymond shocked everyone
by immediately offering
$300,000 for 20%,
which lowered his valuation
from $2 million
to $1.5 million.
O'Leary:
Well, you know...
Cuban: You should say yes.
...I still have a couple
of questions before
I make him an offer.
I'm gonna pull it off
the table in a second.
$300,000, 20% right now.
[ Sighs ]
Well, you don't know
if there's a better offer.
[ Sighs ]
Can I finish
the rest of my information?
[ Laughing ] Oh, man!
I want -- I want you to know
how big this can get.
It's getting --
it's gonna -- okay.
Congratulations,
Solomon.
Guys, it's been a pleasure.
Thank you.
[ Sighs ]
Towards the end,
I was starting to regret it.
