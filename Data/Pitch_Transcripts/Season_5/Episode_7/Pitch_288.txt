Hi, my name
is Solomon Fallas,
and my product is the amazing
and versatile 180cup.
I am here seeking
a $300,000 investment
in exchange for
a 15% stake in my company.
Now, we're all familiar with
this simple, red,
disposable cup.
It continues to be
a prominent icon,
so much so
that in the United States alone,
there are over 2 billion
of these used each year.
I have revolutionized
and made this cup better.
My product, 180cup --
it is a fundamental drinking cup
when right-side up,
and when flipped 180 degrees,
it acts as a shot glass
or a container
or even a measuring cup.
Shoot it,
flip it,
or drink it.
With its dual function,
it's a lot more attractive
than the standard red cup.
Let's say you're at a barbecue
or even a sporting event.
You grab a hot dog
and some fries.
You want some ketchup for
those fries without the mess?
No problem.
With the 180cup,
simply flip it over,
and you have a perfectly
constructed, neat container,
perfect for any of your sauces.
180cup is a clear-cut winner
and soon to be a staple
at every barbecue, tailgate,
birthday party, bar mitzvah.
You name it, 180cup is there.
So, who wants to
take a shot with me?
Greiner: [ Chuckles ]
Have you sold any?
Yes.
In under 6 months, we've sold
over 5 million 180cups...
Whoa!
DeJoria: Wow.
...generating
$385,000 in sales.
Where did you sell them?
We're in 570 stores
to date.
Most of our income
is from local mom-and-pop shops
located
around college campuses.
So, you went
to trade shows
and then, like, sold them
to these mom-and-pops or --
no, actually, I took
a very unique approach
to selling these.
Through my social networks
and craigslist,
we offered collegians
an opportunity to make money.
All they would have to do
is connect us
with their local liquor,
convenience, or grocery store.
We'd send them free
samples. If they sold,
they'd place an order.
Depending on that order,
we'd give the collegians
a commission.
Using that process,
we broke 120 stores.
We've received a 92%
reorder rate from those stores.
So, how long have you
been in business?
Six months.
Wow.
Can I see
one of the cups?
Of course.
Check them out.
They're really cool.
These are our 24 pack.
And we're right there
at the same price
as a standard red cup.
That is the beautiful thing
about this product.
How'd you
come up with this idea?
Went to go visit
my brother in college.
He was hosting
a party for his fraternity.
I personally
didn't go to college,
so I walked in and
I was just immediately in shock.
I counted 900 cups.
There must have been
200 people there.
His friend drops a
shot of whiskey in the
drink and it hit me.
I said,
"these cups are everywhere.
"Someone's making
a ton of money off this.
Why not apply this process
to the red cup?"
Narrator: Solomon is seeking
$300,000 for 15% of his company,
but Daymond shocked everyone
by immediately offering
$300,000 for 20%,
which lowered his valuation
from $2 million
to $1.5 million.
O'Leary:
Well, you know...
Cuban: You should say yes.
...I still have a couple
of questions before
I make him an offer.
I'm gonna pull it off
the table in a second.
$300,000, 20% right now.
[ Sighs ]
Well, you don't know
if there's a better offer.
[ Sighs ]
Can I finish
the rest of my information?
[ Laughing ] Oh, man!
I want -- I want you to know
how big this can get.
It's getting --
it's gonna -- okay.
If you saw a $100 bill on
the ground, would you
stop and pick it up
or would you look to
see if there's more
down the street?
Don't let a guy
railroad you on a deal.
You don't know
if there's another offer here.
Right, I'd like
to hear other offers.
Congratulations,
Solomon.
Guys, it's been a pleasure.
Thank you.
[ Sighs ]
Towards the end,
I was starting to regret it.
Once they were all out
and I was stuck there,
I knew he had me,
but I partnered
with the right guy --
a guy who built a brand,
and I know he's gonna bring
180cups to the next level.
Narrator:
Next into the tank
is an entrepreneur
from Pleasanton, California,
with a new innovation
in water sports.
