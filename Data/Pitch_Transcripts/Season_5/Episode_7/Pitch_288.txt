John Paul DeJoria
joins the sharks.
In the tank,
hopeful entrepreneurs
or they'll
walk away with nothing.
Johnny, tell your dad
he's a great man.
[ Voice breaking ]
I thank God
that I got to work
with that man.
He's an innovator.
He taught me
everything I know.
Narrator:
If the sharks hear a great idea,
they're ready to invest
using their own money.
I'll give you the $400k.
I'm gonna make you
the same offer.
Silence, please.
You know what you're doing.
We got a deal.
Not that deal.
Not that deal?
Oh, no.
O'Leary:
This is the shark tank.
There's nothing else like it
on earth.
Narrator:
Who are the sharks?
John Paul DeJoria
the way people
think about cleaning.
Our products are natural,
they're safe,
Unbelievable cleaning.
Now, this is
really impressive.
This is
a head-to-head competition
Now, I'm going to do
the same thing.
I'm going
to swab that side.
I want to point out
one thing.
Not only
do we do a better job,
but these products
are safe.
How safe, you ask?
That safe.
Sharks, who wants to help us
create a better life?
How long have you been
selling those products?
We launched
about four --
a little over
four years ago.
John: Cash-flow positive,
so the question's going to be...
Correct.
...what do you
need our money for?
Well, we are financially
very healthy,
but we're not simply looking for
a financial partner.
We're looking for
a strategic partner.
I'll give you a loan,
which doesn't cost you anything.
It's a loan, all right?
It's $400,000
for 3 years.
It has 10% interest on it,
of John Paul Selects --
we're global.
Not only do we sell it
over the Internet,
but also we have direct
distribution to major stores
throughout different
parts of the world.
Now, for that $400,000,
if you will go 20%,
if Lori's all for it,
I'll split with her 50/50.
Greiner: Sure.
You've got two people
in that industry.
The only concern is,
though, that that's
valuing the company
at less than
our current sales.
But you -- you have --
ding, ding, ding.
O'Leary: What did you guys
just learn?
Now you have
 two greedy pigs.
[ Laughter ]
Not one.
What if I give you
$500,000 for 20%?
Greiner: Listen, guys.
Here's the thing.
Mark, tell them
what you're thinking.
Cuban:
I'm willing to do $800k
for the 20%.
But what I'd like to do
is see Lori come in,
Very interesting.
I'm gonna make you
the same offer.
So, there's no interest?
There's no originality,
either.
[ Laughter ]
Since Lori, you know,
ran over J.P.
Like a scurvy dog,
yeah, I'm --
I think that --
I think that if --
J.P., if you want to
do something together,
because I think
they shouldn't ignore somebody
John: Well, what --
what -- what about this?
$300,000 for 20% --
you give me the
answer right now.
Oh, wow.
[ Sighs ]
O'Leary:
Well, you know...
You should say yes.
...I still have a couple
of questions before
I make him an offer.
I'm gonna pull it
off the table in a second.
$300,000, 20% right now.
[ Sighs ]
Ooh.
Oh, man!
Yeah, no kidding.
Okay.
With all due respect,
John: I was already
there at the beginning,
because I understood that.
These bobos usually
catch up to me about
10 minutes later, so...
that really has to feel
the passion about something.
If I don't feel it,
I can't really get into it,
so, in this case,
I'm out.
Okay.
[ Sighs ]
You know what you're doing.
We got a deal.
Not that deal.
Not that deal?
Oh, no.
Too late.
No, no, no,
no, no, no.
I thought that's
what you were saying.
Uh-oh.
Oh no, my friend.
Uh-oh, I gave away
all my negotiation -- oh.
I'm in trouble now.
So, you didn't accept
my initial offer.
You know you're gonna have
to pay for that.
Could we do the deal
at the original --
We'll run with it.
I work like a dog.
Don't -- don't --
don't ruin this again.
I've working on it
for seven years.
Just -- just give me
another offer.
Make it a little better
than what I initially offered,
because now
it becomes more valuable.
I'd offer you
$300,000 for 23%.
I'm excited.
Give me a hug.
I'm excited.
All right.
a whole lot of expendable income
just to keep it running.
This is a social product.
John: So, you're --
are you saying --
wait, wait, wait.
No one wanted to buy one.
You're saying
they wanted to buy more?
Exactly.
But keep -- keep trying.
Keep going with your
entrepreneurial spirit.
Well, you know he's gonna
keep on trying 'cause
it's been 10 years.
[ Laughs ]
My name is Johnny Georges,
That's what's happening.
Yes, sir.
Johnny, do you have
a patent on this?
Yes, sir.
I have a utility patent.
How -- how long does it
usually last? One season?
No, sir.
We leave them on for five years.
Greiner:
Yeah, it never degrades.
That can stay on
for five years?
That durable?
Yes, sir.
These things
last over 20 years.
Okay.
How long have they
been on? What's the
oldest one out there?
1984.
Still out there?
My father was an innovator
in the irrigation world.
We used to bank trees,
to make a long one short.
What that means is we take
a shovel before the freeze night
"Hey, Johnny. This is Mrs..."
I said, "yes, ma'am,"
she says,
"I want to pay you
for them five t-pees."
Johnny, you -- you could see
a partner that --
let's say I was a big
distributor of water
irrigation systems,
I need a lot of Johnnys --
there's only one of you.
I need like
2,000 Johnnys
Johnny.
Yes, sir.
Farmers are
the cornerstone of America.
There may be
a lot of farmers out there
that can't afford
$12 per tree,
but maybe they could afford
$6 or $7.
I'm gonna give you
everything you're asking for --
your $150,000 for 20%.
What you're doing
is right,
I'd like to be your partner,
Johnny.
Johnny, tell your dad
he's a great man.
He died 12 years ago.
Ohh.
He's still a great man.
He made me who I --
[ sniffles ]
[ Voice breaking ]
We work hard every day.
I worked for that man
for 20 years.
I thank God that
I got to work with that man.
He's an innovator.
He taught me
everything I know.
He was hard on us,
but nobody owes you nothing.
Life is what you make it.
He taught me that.
Cuban:
You're a star, Johnny.
Man, congratulations.
Thank you.
DeJoria: Superstar, dude.
God bless you, Johnny.
Thank you.
