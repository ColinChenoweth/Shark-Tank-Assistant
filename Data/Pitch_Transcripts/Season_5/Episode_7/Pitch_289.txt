get a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to pitch the sharks
in hopes of
getting an investment
to start, grow,
or save their businesses.
Can I finish
the rest of my information?
[ Laughing ] Oh, man!
It's the worst pitch
I've ever seen.
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
must convince a shark
to invest the full amount
they're asking for,
Kevin O'Leary
is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
worth $4.2 billion.
Mark Cuban, notorious
billionaire entrepreneur,
tech guru,
and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas mavericks.
Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents and
has launched over 300 products,
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in retail sales.
Hello, sharks.
My name's Kevin Tibbs.
And I'm Tim Barklage.
We're the founders
of better life,
and we're requesting
$400,000
in exchange for 7% equity stake
in our company.
[ Chuckles ]
Better life is a unique
line of cleaning products
that will revolutionize
Tim and I both have
young kids the same ages.
When our kids started
crawling around the floor
and putting everything
into their mouths,
we really became concerned
about the products
we had in our home.
And with Kevin being
a formulation chemist,
I put him to the challenge
to create something
that was safe and effective.
Tim and I are gonna show you
just how well they work.
You think soap scum
and hard water stains are tough?
This is spray paint
on this tile right here.
All right, we're gonna put
some of our cleaning product.
And this product --
it's a cream scrub.
No harsh chemicals.
There are no fumes
to this product.
And it's
completely safe.
You don't need gloves,
gas masks, anything like that.
Now, that's from
a plant-based product.
This is what
we're talking about.
Now,
Tim is going to take
this leading-brand
chemical cleaner,
which is a disinfectant.
Oh, God.
Now I want Tim to clean
this side of the countertop
with our
What-ever! Cleaner.
All natural.
There are no fumes
in this product.
I'm going
to swab that surface.
44.
And the funny thing
I want to point out here
is on this product,
it is covered
with warning statements.
It even says on the back
that you need to wash
with soap and water
after you've used
this product.
It's a cleaning product.
Narrator: Kevin and Tim
have three offers.
J.P. And Lori have offered
$400,000 for 20%,
Kevin has offered
a $400,000 loan for 5% equity,
and Daymond has offered
$500,000 for 20%.
What are you gonna do?
Barklage: I think --
I think all the offers
are very generous.
We -- we haven't
heard from mark yet,
and we would like
to hear from him,
just out of respect
to everybody.
Narrator: Lori and Kevin
have the same offer --
a $400,000 loan for 17% equity
that drops to 7%
when the loan is paid back.
For the first time,
my product is gonna be available
at a major retailer.
Oh, my gosh.
Babies "R" Us
has signed on to carry us
in 450 stores nationwide.
So cool.
Before "shark tank,"
we had $12,000 in sales.
Since "shark tank,"
we have over $100,000 in sales
and we're on track
to hit our first $1 million
over the next 12 months.
I have just signed with gund,
the oldest existing
Teddy-bear company in the world.
So many people
contact gund all the time
to ask us how do we
wash our Teddy bears,
and your invention
is genius.
They are taking over all the
manufacturing and distribution,
which allows me
to be in charge of creative,
which is what I enjoy
the most.
Behind it.
Okay, that's great.
The reason I started
this company in the first place
was to be able to stay at home
with my daughter.
I used to spend endless days
behind a desk.
Now thanks
to this licensing deal,
I've been able to move my family
to Hawaii,
and now I spend my days
hunting seashells
with my daughter
on beautiful beaches.
"Shark tank" has made
all of my dreams come true.
Narrator:
Next into the tank
is a 24-year-old entrepreneur
from New York City
with an update
of a classic party favorite.
Oh, man.
You gave me time
to think, then,
so, then,
I guess I have to be out.
Wow.
DeJoria:
Is this patented?
Yes.
It's it patent-pending,
or is it patented?
This is
a fully patented product.
We have a utility patent
and a design patent.
Greiner:
So, your market
is college students,
predominantly,
because that's
who's interested in
having shots and beers
constantly.
Speak for yourself.
[ Laughs ]
Well, I-I'd say yes and no,
because
at the end of the day,
where don't you find
the red plastic cup?
How much of your own
money have you put
in this so far?
$175,000.
Cuban: Oh!
Whoa!
I'm more curious
about your college network.
How many people?
How many campuses?
Are they continuing
to sell for you?
Can you put other products
through there?
Yes, definitely.
Currently, we're in
120 stores, over 30 colleges.
There's 3,000 colleges.
There's 6 1/2 million kids
in college.
So, we're basically covering
1% of the market,
and we've generated
$385,000 in sales.
You know, college kids
interact with each other
and with more people
than anyone else.
A friend in Seattle is gonna
tell his friend in New York.
I want to build a brand.
So, some dude's walking around
a fraternity party
doing shots out of
this and that looks
cool, basically,
or playing flip cup
or whatever.
Right.
Because then all of a
sudden, you could start
putting logos on there.
Happy you said that.
See, we came out with these cups
in clear, as well.
So, now, what I created
these clear cups for
was to go after
these spirit companies.
J.P., imagine if you could
send your customers these cups
as a promotional item
with your logo on it.
Not only are they gonna be
drinking your stuff,
but your logo is gonna
be smack in the face
of your customer.
Kevin, it's making money.
That's what we both love.
You know, the ketchup
and mustard thing,
that's a load of crap.
We both know that.
This thing
is a bar deal,
and I understand
you've got
a very interesting way
of selling it.
Uh...
I, uh -- I'm out.
When I gave you
a hard offer immediately,
you just
ignored that offer.
My --
my feelings are hurt.
Daymond, with all due respect,
it was just a little too early.
I wa-- I just --
I need to treat this --
I need to --
I need to be fair to myself.
Now I become
a little bit more valuable
because everybody else
fell out.
Would you like
to make me feel better?
Warm and toasty?
And we can go
do shots together?
Truth is, you built a brand.
I can't. I've invested
too much time and money.
I'll stick to the 23%.
25%.
2% is not gonna
make or break me.
All right. We got a deal.
All right.
Greiner:
Congratulations.
It almost did
make or break you.
It almost did.
The retail price point
estimated about $2,800.
$2,800?
$2,800?
So, $2,800 and you're gonna
buy 2 or 3 or 4?
And, actually,
one of the big --
you'd buy one
and try it out first
and see,
"do I like it?"
How much
of your own money is in it?
It's hard to say exactly,
but I'd say probably about
$130,000 over the last 10 years.
What did you spend it on?!
I mean, you could have
built prototypes,
and just sell
one at a time
and then improve it and take
another affordable step forward.
Right now, there is a market
in the top-end luxury brand
that wants to take this
thing and take it on
their yachts with them.
That's totally a market.
[ Laughs ]
Do you -- do you have
a patent on this?
A provisional patent,
yes, I do.
A provisional patent.
Provisional --
so you haven't filed yet.
Why?
What's stopping you?
It -- it's --
it's the dollars.
Every time
we ask a business question,
you hit us with,
"but so-and-so wants it.
"But such-and-such
is this.
There's a huge market
for this."
You had so many
different opportunities
to actually build a product
and go sell it --
over 10 years!
10 years,
you couldn't figure out
how to go and get a product
and sell it!
You're not a businessman.
You're an inventor.
Just know who you are
and be that person
and find somebody else
to run the business.
But it's not gonna be me.
I'm out.
I think
it's a good concept,
but one of
the biggest problems is,
you haven't really
tested this out
with a lot of people.
You know, when you have
a product like this,
you have to worry about
liability.
You have to worry about
people going out there
and getting hurt.
I don't like to be
a part of products
where people can get hurt,
and so, for that reason,
I'm out.
than a full-time job.
One day some of that
could take off,
but at this particular
point, uh...
...I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you, sharks.
people practice their irrigation
takes time.
I need an investment
from the sharks
to grow this business.
I want to promote
water conservation worldwide,
and without them, there's no way
for a guy like me to do that.
Hello, sharks.
