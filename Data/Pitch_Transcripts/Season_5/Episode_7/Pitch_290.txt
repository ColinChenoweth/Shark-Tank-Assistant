Hello, sharks,
my name is Jason Woods,
You know, it's basically --
John: Jason, wait.
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't get my answer.
If somebody wanted to buy one,
you would just say,
"no,
I don't want to sell one."
No, absolutely not.
I-I-I certainly would.
The problem is I just don't
want to sell something
out of my garage, you know?
John: Why?
Yeah, but, Jason,
you're so full of crap.
What I want to do is get
to the large volume production
so I can sell something
that's affordable
for people who can't
get on the water right now.
O'Leary:
Why don't you tell us,
before you get completely
fried in here,
'cause it's
starting to happen.
I'm starting to feel
sorry for you, 'cause
I'm a really nice guy.
[ Laughter ]
I want to know what your
distribution strategy is.
Like --
he doesn't even
have a product.
He hasn't even gotten
the patent on the product.
I want to know,
if you could --
if you could build it
for $1,200
Jason, you're not an
entrepreneur. You're
a want-repreneur.
Jason, how do you think
your pitch went today?
[ Chuckles ]
Obviously,
I didn't have sales.
I'm gonna
give it to you straight.
It's the worst pitch
I've ever seen.
I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
You know, Jason,
a $1-million valuation
with no sales was insane.
I'm not the first
to do that.
I know, but you are going to
prove a lesson to others
not to make
this mistake again.
But you have
made deals with people
that have come in
with $1-million valuations
that didn't have sales.
Not this one,
not here today.
That's not gonna happen.
I'm out.
Jason, it seems to be
more of a hobby for you
Appreciate your time.
Good luck, Jason.
Thank you.
Good luck.
You know,
he's an inventor.
He's not an entrepreneur.
He's not a businessman.
O'Leary: I hate it.
