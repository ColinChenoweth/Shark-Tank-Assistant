My name's James Ambler.
I live in New York City
  with my wife, Kate,
and my 1-year-old daughter,
  Milla,
and I am the proud owner
  of Paparazzi Proposals.
I've been
  a paparazzi photographer
for the last six years
  in New York City.
Being a paparazzi photographer
has really helped me
  in building this business.
I don't get flustered
  under pressure,
Hello,
  my name's James Ambler,
and I'm the proud owner
  of Paparazzi Proposals.
We are asking for $250,000
  for 20% equity in our company.
I've been
  a paparazzi photographer
for the last six years,
and now I use
  these sneaky skills
to help capture
  that amazing question
that every girl wants to hear.
Paparazzi Proposals came about
four years ago
  when I proposed to my wife,
and after we started to tell
friends and family
  about our engagement,
the first question
  that everybody asked was,
"How did he do it?"
this got me thinking.
It would have been so cool
  to have some pictures
of me down on one knee.
So, I started looking into it
  and researching to see
if there was anybody
  or any company out there
offering this unique service,
  and there wasn't.
So, in June 2011,
  we launched Paparazzi Proposals.
And I've spent
  the last two years
marketing and branding
  this unique company in America.
So, sharks, it just leaves me
  with just one very big question
that I need to ask you.
I'm rather nervous about it.
[ laughter ]
Which one of you sharks
will marry Paparazzi Proposals?
[ laughter ]
Get off your knees.
  Let's talk about money.
Okay, why do you need
  a quarter of a million dollars?
We've really been focusing
  this business
in New York City
  where I'm based,
and we want
  to use that money
to help expand
  into other cities.
The other angle
  that we've done
is we go into jewelry stores,
and we educate the jewelers
  about our service.
The key success to this
is getting jewelers excited
  and on board
and wanting to put this
  into their clients' hand
as they give them
  their engagement ring.
What's in it for them?
We offered a kickback
  for the jewelers to start with.
With the social marketing
  and the media that's out there,
this is a great product
for a jeweler to advertise
  their -- their product.
Okay.
  What were your sales?
We did just under $100,000
  in sales in the last two years.
Why are you so focused
  on the jewelers?
'Cause I think
  it's key to the success.
Why not wedding shows?
  Why not wedding magazines?
Oh, yeah, 'cause lots of guys
  watch those.
"Oh, wait, the game's up,
  but I'm gonna get proposed."
  Well, no,
  but hang on, Mark.
"Let's turn on
  the Wedding Channel."
Well, you know, I see
  this as, like, a cross
  between a private eye...
Yeah.
  ...and a wedding
  photographer...
Yeah, good analogy.
  ...because it has to look
  really good, quality.
Exactly.
  But they
  have to hide out.
The main idea is, guys need help
  planning their proposals,
so we find out his ideas,
where -- w-where and how
  he might be looking to propose.
We offer him help
  with any kind of logistics,
if he wants flowers there.
So you give them
  suggestions.
  Yeah.
You aid with flowers
  or something romantic,
and then you also are there
  to capture the moment.
Exactly.
Part of the reason
that we're looking
  for investment
is also to partner
  with someone
who may be able
  to put us into Kay's and Jared.
That'd be a huge, huge, huge,
  enormous mistake,
because if you did,
and they put it in 20 stores,
  you're dead, right?
Really?
Because how are you
  going to keep up?
Let's just say they brought you
  five deals a week,
and you're in charge
  with managing, quality,
and making sure they're all
  fulfilled properly...
  right.
...and following up
  and making sure that
  everything works, right?
Exactly.
  A business
  can die from success.
Well, but he also
  could handle it.
Oh, there's no way,
  there's no way.
  Wait, wait.
In a service-oriented,
  creative business,
if you make a deal
  with a big retailer
who's gonna put you
  in 20 stores,
you don't have time
  to figure that out.
But wait a minute,
  time out. Time out.
  And that's a great way
  to lose customers.
O'Leary: I don't know
  why you guys are fighting.
No one's even talked
  about the fact
that he's asking
  over a million-dollar
  valuation of this idea.
Whoa, Kevin. Why is it worth
  that much money? $1.2 million.
It isn't. It isn't. It isn't.
  There's so much competition.
  Greiner: Wait.
Herjavec:
  James, speak to that.
Why is your business
  worth $1. --
  time out, whoa, whoa.
I want to go back to what Mark
  was saying.
Can I -- can I -- I'll be
  with you very shortly.
Can I just answer
  Lori's question first?
Greiner: back to what -- back to
  what mark was saying, though --
  We will talk about
  your valuation...
I know, Kevin.
  ...which, by the way,
  is insane.
I know, thank you.
No, it is.
  We've got to deal with it.
It's so insane,
  I have to hear now why.
Yeah, well, I'd just like
  to address Lori,
who actually
  was trying to --
  then you're avoiding
  the real question.
Thank you very much.
  No, no,
  I will come back to you.
I do want to go back to that,
  to Kevin's point.
That's
  very kind of you.
  But the thing is,
I see this as something
  that you could fully manage.
He could have maybe
  40 different things written up
as ways
  in which to propose.
It's a template. He could have
  his staff use it.
He could operate
  out of New York, Mark.
That's exactly the model
  that we're going to use.
  He could operate
  out of his home.
You don't even need
  a lot of office space.
  But what's your point?
My point is is that he
  could easily scale this
  fast and quick.
You'd get crushed.
Now, look. I love
  two industries very much.
I love weddings,
  and I love people dying.
You know why?
Because when both
  of those happen,
people make stupid decisions,
  emotional decisions,
not financial decisions.
And because
  that is the case,
there's huge industries
  behind both of those,
including a whole ton of
  wedding photographers out there
that could
  easily do this.
And I don't really see you
  being significantly different.
You are not worth
  $1.25 million, my friend.
Okay.
  I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Look, James, you should
  be growing organically,
taking your wins
  from one city to the next,
because if it truly
  can scale,
and it truly can grow,
  like Lori seems to think...
  Yep.
...then you could make
  a boatload of money in New York,
then move to Chicago,
boatload in Chicago,
  then move to L.A.,
rather than trying to hit
  all these cities at one time.
Right.
  And so, because
  I don't think
this is
  an investment conducive
to my getting a return,
  I'm out.
Okay, thank you
  very much for your time.
You're welcome
  very much.
Well, James, I think
  you're a fantastic operator.
Thank you.
I just can't get over
  the $250,000.
I figure
  it has a potential to earn
uh, a lot more
  than half a million.
James, I think you're nuts
  going out of New York
until you've saturated
  that market,
and this is not a business
  for an investor.
This is your business,
  your concierge service.
I can't imagine
  making money on this business
as an outsider
  coming in.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you,
  again, Barbara.
You're welcome,
  my friend.
You know, I think the idea
  is amazing.
Thank you.
  I think
  it's a home run.
The romantic in me,
  and I think, Barb, you -- You --
Romantic, too --
  I'm not a romantic,
  definitely not.
Well,
  the romantic in me --
I think this is fantastic.
To have a memory
  of your proposal is great.
The problem that I have
  is your valuation.
I don't see where you need
  the $250,000.
That's my problem...
  okay.
...because I don't think
  that you need to put
a lot of money
  into this business at all.
How's he going to train
  all the jewelers that you
  thought was a great idea?
I still think
  it's a great idea.
  How is he gonna
  train them
and send people
  to introduce it?
  And I think you should go
  to tuxedo places.
I'll tell you
  the difference.
When I started, I,
  just myself, figured it out.
And you know what, Mark?
  I pounded the pavement.
I went, 21 cities, 18 days.
  You're -- You're
  missing the point.
You're being a hypocrite, Lori.
  Lori, you're being a hypocrite.
  No, I'm not
  being a hypocrite.
Yes, you're saying he's got
  the right idea to scale --
  but you're being rude
  because you're interrupting me.
You're saying he's got
  the right idea to scale,
but then you're telling him
  he doesn't need the money.
Wait.
  But you've got to go out
  and train everybody.
Wait, wait.
  No, you're saying that.
That's not
  what I'm saying.
  You said it.
You're interrupting me.
  So you haven't even heard
  what I'm saying yet.
I heard
  what you said earlier...
  No, you need to stop.
...that it was a great,
  scalable idea.
  Time out, Mark.
So, he doesn't have to go
  to these other cities --
But --
  Okay, so let's just say
  within New York,
all the different
  jewelry companies.
But you know what?
  You -- but you said
  it was a great idea
to go
  to the different jewelers.
  He finds who is --
Who -- Who's the top buyer
  for Kay jewelers.
He finds
  who's the top buyer.
  What's a buyer gonna do?
It's the people who sell it
  that are gonna do the work.
What I'm saying is, he goes in,
  he sells it to them.
They get
  their staff enlisted.
The staff then --
  are you kidding me?
No, I'm not kidding you.
  I did it myself.
So the buyer -- the buyer
  of a jewelry company...
  mark.
...is gonna go to the people
  who run the retail floor...
  I went --
...and tell them
  to train the retail sales people
to sell the service.
  Yes, absolutely.
If it's an initiative
  that that store wants to do,
and they make a kickback,
  absolutely.
I've seen it done
  all the time.
  O'Leary: Why are you
  fighting about this
when the whole business
  isn't worth $250,000?
  Look. Wait.
I just wish you'd come in here
  with a different offer.
You simply say to him,
"I'll give you $250,000
  for 250% of this company."
[ laughs ]
  That's the only way
  you can do this deal.
For me
  to give you $250,000,
I would want
  a lot bigger piece of the pie.
Narrator: Three sharks are out.
Lori seems interested,
but the 20% stake
  James is offering is too small.
For me
  to give you $250,000,
I would want
  a lot bigger piece of the pie
because I feel like
  I could show you
how to take this business and
  quickly get it off the ground
without needing
  a big staff.
So, I will
  make you an offer.
Okay.
I'm offering you
  $250,000,
but I'm gonna want 50%
because I see us winding up
  being equal partners.
James, your business isn't even
  worth half a million right now,
and yet you've
  just got that offer.
Are you
  out of your mind?
It doesn't make sense that you
  wouldn't take that offer.
Ambler: I'm very humbled
'cause this has been
  my heart and soul for two years.
This has to work.
But part of the reason
  this has to work
is because I have to believe
  and trust in myself.
I have to hold my head high,
  and I have to respect myself.
50% equity, it's just
  not gonna work for me.
So, if there's
  a negotiation
that we can maybe start
  to do a little dance --
Well, the negotiating works
  with you making a counteroffer.
I think there's a different way
  to structure it, Lori.
Oh, no question you think
  there's a different way
  to structure it.
And so let me explain
what would be more interesting
  for your money,
because I'm very married --
  married --
  Ohh!
I'm very married to mine,
  and we're very happy together.
You know how you know
  it's a bad deal?
No, it's gonna be
  a great deal.
  Kevin's talking.
Do you want to
  hear it, or not?
Sure, why not?
  Greiner:
  I want to hear it.
Okay.
  I'll go in with Lori.
And I'll slightly change
  the structure, all right?
  [ laughs ]
We will give you $50,000
for a third of the business,
  all right?
That's the equity piece.
And we'll loan you
  $200,000 as you need it.
That way, we can actually
  make a deal that makes sense
because your deal doesn't.
Well, you know,
  I rarely agree with Kevin.
  Ambler: Okay.
But I think that was
  a good, creative, new offer.
O'Leary: Thank you. Are you
  interested in partnering?
I am interested
  in partnering with him.
So, he's valuing
  you company
at less than the cash
  you were asking for coming in.
  Yeah, I was -- I know.
Correct, my friend.
Let me call your wife.
[ laughter ]
Um, can I just talk
  before you contact my wife?
You may.
  Yeah, thank you.
Um, Robert,
  you were on the fence.
I'll give you $100,000
  under the same terms.
It's a very clever way
  to structure the deal.
Thank you.
So, I'll give you
  $100,000
for one-third
  of the business today
and loan you the rest
  as you need it
to expand
  the business.
So, I've got
  a counteroffer for you.
Lori, partner with Robert,
  and we'll do a deal.
'cause Lori brings so much
  to this table.
Do you
  not want my offer?
I don't not want it.
I would just like to see
  what Lori thinks about that.
Do the deal with Lori. Robert,
  let her do the deal with Lori.
So, my offer isn't good enough
  unless I bring Lori in.
  No, no, no, not at all.
But I'm
  a stopgap for you.
Yeah, you're the girl
  that didn't get the
  proposal, but don't worry.
Stay -- stick around
  in case the first one says no.
I'm -- I'm not good
  at playing second fiddle.
I thought I made you
  a very fair offer
when these guys didn't give you
  the value you deserve today.
Take it or leave it.
Thank you.
I will give you an answer
  very shortly.
Ohh!
James, I'll give you
  an answer right now.
I'm out.
So, all roads be,
  as they are,
leading back to Mr. Wonderful,
  yet again.
So now you're back
  to the original offer, $50,000.
Your offer's
  ridiculous.
An additional $200,000
  as a loan as you need it.
Yeah,
  that's horrible.
  Then why don't you
  make an offer?
Instead of
  insulting my offer.
I don't want him
  to make a stupid mistake!
  CORCORAN: Let him answer.
Greiner: Why are you saying
  he's making a mistake?
Because I think he's
  making a horrid mistake
  if he does 50k for --
he has two
  very smart sharks here.
  That's fine.
O'Leary: Then make him
  a better offer.
Enough!
Calm down.
  What do you want to do?
I want to add
  one thing.
I started grassroots --
  One product, one idea --
and I had to tackle
  everything to get out
  there in the market...
we already heard that story,
  Lori. What are you gonna do?
...to build
  a $500-Million brand.
  We've heard this story already,
  Lori. What are we gonna do?
So he's going to benefit greatly
  from what's right here.
What I know
  that you can do --
James, you lost -- You lost
  one offer because you -- You
  weren't clear and concise.
This is like
  a marriage proposal.
Would the deal go down to 30%,
  we have a deal.
Because I know it's 33.3%,
  but I came in here 30%.
We're good
  with that.
  We're good with that.
Done.
  Who wants the ring?
[ laughs ]
  we get the ring.
Herjavec: Wow.
  What?
  O'Leary: I'll give it
  to my sharkette partner.
I don't get that.
Thank you for marrying
  Paparazzi Proposals.
Ah! Thank you.
Thank you so much.
  I really appreciate it.
I think
  I'm going to cry.
Thank you.
  Thank you very much
  for taking the time.
Thank you. Good luck.
  I really appreciate it.
Corcoran: Good luck.
  Thank you.
Ambler: I'm really surprised
  I made a deal with Kevin,
'cause I was really going
  after Lori and maybe Robert,
but Robert got his knickers
  in a twist
and decided
  to go home early.
Greiner:
  I'm making a proclamation.
A year from now,
  this is gonna be huge.
And you know, Lori,
  he saved your Butt.
Him restructuring
  the deal --
You were about to go down that
  path and make a stupid deal.
No.
  Thank god he jumped in,
  definitely.
I never make deals
  that I think are stupid.
  I hate to admit it,
  but he did.
He got you
  the right deal on that.
  I do what I believe in.
Barbara, kiss the ring.
Narrator: Last season,
  Rabbi Moshe Weiss made a deal
with Daymond for his ipad
  accessory, the soundbender.
It clips right onto the back
  magnetically, beautifully,
reflecting the sound
  right towards you.
Narrator: Let's see
  what he's doing now.
Weiss: Who would have thought
  that, in only one year,
a Rabbi
  from St. Paul, minnesota,
would be flying down
  to New York City
for a sales meeting
  with Daymond John?
Daymond!
  [ Laughs ]
Moshe, welcome
  to new York, man.
It's good
  to see you, Buddy.
How you doing?
  I'm great, man.
Before "Shark Tank,"
  Sales were at $7,000.
Post "Shark Tank,"
  we're nearing $250,000.
So one of the reasons
  I brought you out here today
was to talk about licensing
  and introduce you
to Scott
  at The Wish Factory.
Licensing is an amazing
  opportunity for soundbender.
You get a large company
to basically
  do all the work for you,
manufacture it,
  bill it, ship it,
and every quarter,
  you get a check.
So, Moshe, I wanted to introduce
  you to The Wish Factory team.
So, in anticipation
  of your coming here today,
we've done a little bit
  of ground work.
We're going to take
  Marvel's "Avengers"
And marry that
  to soundbender.
Wish Factory's
  gonna guarantee to sell
$2 million
  worth of soundbenders a year.
That's the minimum guarantee.
You are my superheroes.
We're thrilled
  that you're thrilled.
Weiss: Having a partner
  and mentor like Daymond John
is a dream come True
because he's all about you
and building the brand
  within you.
All right.
  Awesome, man! Whoo!
Done deal.
  [ laughs ]
Narrator:
  Next up is an innovative way
  to communicate with babies
before they're even born.
