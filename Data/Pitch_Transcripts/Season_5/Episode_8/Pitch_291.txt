My name's James Ambler.
I live in New York City
  with my wife, Kate,
Hello,
  my name's James Ambler,
Herjavec:
  James, speak to that.
Why is your business
  worth $1. --
  time out, whoa, whoa.
I want to go back to what Mark
  was saying.
Can I -- can I -- I'll be
  with you very shortly.
Can I just answer
  Lori's question first?
Greiner: back to what -- back to
  what mark was saying, though --
  We will talk about
  your valuation...
I know, Kevin.
  ...which, by the way,
  is insane.
I know, thank you.
No, it is.
  We've got to deal with it.
It's so insane,
  I have to hear now why.
Yeah, well, I'd just like
  to address Lori,
who actually
  was trying to --
  then you're avoiding
  the real question.
Thank you very much.
  No, no,
  I will come back to you.
I do want to go back to that,
  to Kevin's point.
That's
  very kind of you.
  But the thing is,
I see this as something
  that you could fully manage.
He could have maybe
  40 different things written up
as ways
  in which to propose.
It's a template. He could have
  his staff use it.
He could operate
  out of New York, Mark.
That's exactly the model
  that we're going to use.
  He could operate
  out of his home.
You don't even need
  a lot of office space.
  But what's your point?
Look, James, you should
  be growing organically,
taking your wins
  from one city to the next,
because if it truly
  can scale,
Well, James, I think
  you're a fantastic operator.
Thank you.
I just can't get over
  the $250,000.
I figure
  it has a potential to earn
uh, a lot more
  than half a million.
James, I think you're nuts
  going out of New York
until you've saturated
  that market,
but the 20% stake
  James is offering is too small.
For me
  to give you $250,000,
I would want
  a lot bigger piece of the pie
because I feel like
  I could show you
James, your business isn't even
  worth half a million right now,
Ambler: I'm very humbled
Well, you know,
  I rarely agree with Kevin.
  Ambler: Okay.
But I think that was
  a good, creative, new offer.
O'Leary: Thank you. Are you
  interested in partnering?
I am interested
  in partnering with him.
So, he's valuing
  you company
at less than the cash
  you were asking for coming in.
  Yeah, I was -- I know.
Correct, my friend.
Let me call your wife.
[ laughter ]
Um, can I just talk
  before you contact my wife?
You may.
  Yeah, thank you.
Um, Robert,
  you were on the fence.
I'll give you $100,000
  under the same terms.
It's a very clever way
  to structure the deal.
Thank you.
So, I'll give you
  $100,000
for one-third
  of the business today
James, I'll give you
  an answer right now.
I'm out.
So, all roads be,
  as they are,
leading back to Mr. Wonderful,
  yet again.
So now you're back
  to the original offer, $50,000.
Your offer's
  ridiculous.
An additional $200,000
  as a loan as you need it.
Yeah,
  that's horrible.
  Then why don't you
  make an offer?
Instead of
  insulting my offer.
I don't want him
  to make a stupid mistake!
  CORCORAN: Let him answer.
Greiner: Why are you saying
  he's making a mistake?
Because I think he's
  making a horrid mistake
  if he does 50k for --
he has two
  very smart sharks here.
  That's fine.
O'Leary: Then make him
  a better offer.
Enough!
Calm down.
  What do you want to do?
I want to add
  one thing.
I started grassroots --
  One product, one idea --
Ambler: I'm really surprised
  I made a deal with Kevin,
