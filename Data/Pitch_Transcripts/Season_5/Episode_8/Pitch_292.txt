My name is Sarah Schulz,
of Schulzies bread pudding.
I'm seeking investment
  of $160,000
for a 20% equity stake
  in Schulzies.
Schulzies is rich, creamy,
  delicious, fresh bread pudding.
I'll let your taste buds
  go for it,
Thank you, Sarah.
Greiner:
  This is amazing.
  O'Leary: Sarah, it's amazing.
Mm. Delicious.
Cuban: Incredible.
  Oh, my God.
How many calories
  in this?
No calories, Kevin.
  [ laughs ] 9,000.
  Wow.
This isn't bread pudding.
There is a child here,
so you won't look like this if
  you keep eating bread pudding.
[ laughter ]
Who's ready to build
  a bread-pudding empire with me?
So, tell us
  what the business is?
There's nothing like it
  on the market.
People don't know what it is,
  so I need it to say,
"here I am, world.
  I got bread pudding."
You rented
  retail space?
Not any old retail.
I got on my bike
  in Venice Beach,
But Sarah,
  is that a store?
  Greiner:
  Is this like a store?
So, it's a store.
Sarah, remember the little
  window across from Muscle Beach?
Yes.
  How many square feet
  was that?
It was 140 square feet.
140 square feet?
Yeah, it's just
  this little tiny window --
How many dollars
  in sales last year in that?
Last year,
  it was $190,000.
Sarah, how did you go from
  Venice Beach to San Francisco?
So, San Francisco,
  it's part-Time home,
[ laughter ]
  O'Leary: Sarah.
So, Sarah, stay focused
  on the numbers for a second.
  Yes.
How much are you gonna rent
  that 800 square feet for?
It's $3,200 a month.
You mean, San Francisco
  is open now?
Yes.
What did it do in sales
  last month?
So, last month,
  we did $30,000.
That's --
  That's okay.
That sounds
  pretty good to me.
  It does to me, too.
It's good,
  but I'm not satisfied.
I want more.
I'm this entrepreneur
  that has ideas,
Okay, Sarah, what's missing
  in your presentation
is sort of the
  operational-execution aspect.
It's not investable,
  not for me.
I don't know that you're
  gonna execute a business plan
because there isn't
  a business plan yet.
Just my opinion.
I'm out.
Okay.
For me, I don't doubt
  at all
that you don't love
  your bread pudding.
  Mm-hmm.
Sarah,
  it's not there today.
  All right.
I'm out.
All right.
Look, the problem is you,
  by yourself.
You need a complementary partner
  who can guide you.
You need that desperately,
  desperately.
You have a great idea.
  You have a great opportunity.
Your biggest risk is you.
For that reason,
  I'm out.
All right.
Greiner:
  I love the saying,
"Don't go
  where the path may lead.
Thanks, Sarah.
  Herjavec:
  Thank you, Sarah.
Watch out
  for bread-pudding parlors.
Corcoran: Okay.
  Everywhere.
How great
  Schulzies bread pudding is,
it was confirmation.
I will never stop Schulzies
until it needs to get
  to where it needs to be.
Radical Raspberry.
Greiner:
  Look at us pigs.
Oh, don't double-dip.
  [ laughs ]
What do you mean?
