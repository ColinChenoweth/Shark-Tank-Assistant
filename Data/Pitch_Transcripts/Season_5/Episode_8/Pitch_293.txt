My name is Sarah Schulz,
and I am the founder, the baker,
  and the mastermind
of Schulzies bread pudding.
I'm seeking investment
  of $160,000
for a 20% equity stake
  in Schulzies.
Schulzies is rich, creamy,
  delicious, fresh bread pudding.
I'll let your taste buds
  go for it,
and you can see
  the proof is in the pudding.
All right.
Sweet Home Strawberry.
Thank you, Sarah.
And you have
  my Celestial Chocolate Chunk...
GREINER: That is just what
  I wanted, looking at the sign.
...with a caramel sauce.
And for you, Mr. Wonderful,
Coconut with a little bit
  of strawberry sauce.
O'Leary: Thank you,
  thank you.
  Wow.
This is
  the Caramel Charisma.
Mm, thank you.
Mark,
  Radical Raspberry.
  There you go.
Greiner:
  This is amazing.
  O'Leary: Sarah, it's amazing.
Mm. Delicious.
Cuban: Incredible.
  Oh, my God.
How many calories
  in this?
No calories, Kevin.
  [ laughs ] 9,000.
  Wow.
This isn't bread pudding.
There is a child here,
so you won't look like this if
  you keep eating bread pudding.
[ laughter ]
Who's ready to build
  a bread-pudding empire with me?
So, tell us
  what the business is?
There's nothing like it
  on the market.
People don't know what it is,
  so I need it to say,
"here I am, world.
  I got bread pudding."
You rented
  retail space?
Not any old retail.
I got on my bike
  in Venice Beach,
and I found
  a little tiny window
right across from Muscle Beach,
  where they work out,
that I rented
  for about a year and a half.
And I recently did
  a asset purchase agreement
a little over a year ago
  and let someone else run it
so I could really do
  my vision.
You ran away
  from your business.
No, not even close!
Are you ready?
Ready.
I got my dream --
A bread-pudding parlor,
and it's in San Francisco,
  and it is beautiful.
[ laughs ]
But Sarah,
  is that a store?
  Greiner:
  Is this like a store?
So, it's a store.
O'Leary: Okay, okay.
  And so, we have
  the walk-up window.
Sarah, remember the little
  window across from Muscle Beach?
Yes.
  How many square feet
  was that?
It was 140 square feet.
140 square feet?
Yeah, it's just
  this little tiny window --
How many dollars
  in sales last year in that?
Last year,
  it was $190,000.
Sarah, how did you go from
  Venice Beach to San Francisco?
So, San Francisco,
  it's part-Time home,
and also, though, they have
  a really unique foodie market.
Is your
  San Francisco store
different from your
  Venice Beach store?
It's a walk-Through,
  brick-and-mortar location.
It has more flavors. You --
How many square feet?
San Francisco
  is 800 square feet.
This is a mock-up,
so you could kind of
  generally see
what is
  a bread-pudding parlor.
So, you're a yogurt store
  with bread pudding?
[ laughter ]
  O'Leary: Sarah.
So, Sarah, stay focused
  on the numbers for a second.
  Yes.
How much are you gonna rent
  that 800 square feet for?
It's $3,200 a month.
You mean, San Francisco
  is open now?
Yes.
What did it do in sales
  last month?
So, last month,
  we did $30,000.
That's --
  That's okay.
That sounds
  pretty good to me.
  It does to me, too.
It's good,
  but I'm not satisfied.
I want more.
I'm this entrepreneur
  that has ideas,
and I'm a mover
  and a shaker.
Okay, so here's
  a problem right now, all right?
The way to look at it
  is dollars per square
  foot of sales.
Correct.
  That's how you can become
  a franchisable business.
Your first concept
  was to open up 140 square feet,
and you were actually
  selling $1,300 a foot,
which is
  very, very good.
It was.
  Okay?
Then you moved
  to San Francisco.
Based on
  the first 3 months,
you've dropped
  from $1,300
down to $450
  per square foot of sales,
which is not good.
You're not gonna make
  any money this year
if that store
  stays at that level,
'cause you got to pay people,
  and you have to pay the rent.
And you've got $200,000
  of capex to amortize.
What happened between
  Muscle Beach and San Francisco?
It's a whole new Market.
Muscle Beach
  has the foot traffic.
Then I moved
  to San Francisco.
People haven't heard
  about me.
I have spent no money
  in marketing whatsoever.
Cuban: Let me
  ask you a question.
How much money
  have you invested?
I have put in $300,000.
  Whoa.
I'm curious.
  Where did you get that money?
It was from my dad, and that's
  why it's his name -- Schulzies.
And as he passed, it was a gift,
  and I invested it all.
That was the total amount
  he left you?
Yes.
Okay, Sarah, what's missing
  in your presentation
is sort of the
  operational-execution aspect.
It's not investable,
  not for me.
I don't know that you're
  gonna execute a business plan
because there isn't
  a business plan yet.
Just my opinion.
I'm out.
Okay.
For me, I don't doubt
  at all
that you don't love
  your bread pudding.
  Mm-hmm.
And absolutely delicious.
Right.
  Cuban: Amazing.
But I couldn't imagine making
  money with you, for some reason.
I'm gonna have to trust
  my instinct on that. I'm out.
And there is not a question
  in my mind
that this isn't
  just about a business.
This isn't about a product.
This is about an empire.
Your passion for the product
  is fantastic.
I don't think you did
  a -- a great job
in showing me a business plan
  that I can get excited about.
It's there.
It's not.
  The direction's there.
Sarah,
  it's not there today.
  All right.
I'm out.
All right.
Look, the problem is you,
  by yourself.
You need a complementary partner
  who can guide you.
You need that desperately,
  desperately.
You have a great idea.
  You have a great opportunity.
Your biggest risk is you.
For that reason,
  I'm out.
All right.
Greiner:
  I love the saying,
"Don't go
  where the path may lead.
Go where there is no path,
  and leave a Trail."
You could be on the brink
  of something fantastic,
but I wish
  you were more there.
I-I see you
  as teetering right now.
For me, it's not the right time
  to invest in your company.
And so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Okay.
Great product.
Greiner:
  Yeah, great product.
Thanks, Sarah.
  Herjavec:
  Thank you, Sarah.
Watch out
  for bread-pudding parlors.
Corcoran: Okay.
  Everywhere.
I want to get up
  and go try more.
To hear them tell me
How great
  Schulzies bread pudding is,
it was confirmation.
I will never stop Schulzies
until it needs to get
  to where it needs to be.
Radical Raspberry.
Greiner:
  Look at us pigs.
Oh, don't double-dip.
  [ laughs ]
What do you mean?
