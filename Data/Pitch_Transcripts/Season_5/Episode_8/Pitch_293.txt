And they're willing
  to fight each other
for a piece of the action.
You're being
  a hypocrite, Lori.
Lori, you're being
  a hypocrite.
  No, I'm not
  being a hypocrite.
Yes.
  You're interrupting me.
So you haven't even heard
  what I'm saying yet.
I heard
  what you said earlier.
No one's even talked
  about the fact
that he's asking
  over a million-dollar valuation.
Enough!
Take it or leave it.
Narrator:
  Who are the sharks?
They're self-made millionaire
  and billionaire investors
who are entrepreneurs
  themselves.
Kevin O'Leary
  is a venture capitalist
who turned a $10,000 loan
into a software business
  worth $4.2 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went from
  waiting tables in manhattan
to building the city's
  preeminent real-estate empire.
Robert Herjavec, the son
  of an immigrant factory worker,
is now a technology mogul
Who sold his first internet
  companies for over $350 million.
Lori Greiner, the queen of qvc,
  holds over 100 patents,
and has launched
  over 300 products
grossing over a half a billion
  dollars in retail sales.
And Mark Cuban, notorious
  billionaire entrepreneur,
tech guru,
  and the outspoken owner
of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank
  is an entrepreneur
with a new way to serve
  an old-fashioned dessert.
Are you guys ready
  for something good?
Are you guys ready
  for something new?
[ laughs ]
and I am the founder, the baker,
  and the mastermind
and you can see
  the proof is in the pudding.
All right.
Sweet Home Strawberry.
And you have
  my Celestial Chocolate Chunk...
GREINER: That is just what
  I wanted, looking at the sign.
...with a caramel sauce.
And for you, Mr. Wonderful,
Coconut with a little bit
  of strawberry sauce.
O'Leary: Thank you,
  thank you.
  Wow.
This is
  the Caramel Charisma.
Mm, thank you.
Mark,
  Radical Raspberry.
  There you go.
and I found
  a little tiny window
right across from Muscle Beach,
  where they work out,
that I rented
  for about a year and a half.
And I recently did
  a asset purchase agreement
a little over a year ago
  and let someone else run it
so I could really do
  my vision.
You ran away
  from your business.
No, not even close!
Are you ready?
Ready.
I got my dream --
A bread-pudding parlor,
and it's in San Francisco,
  and it is beautiful.
[ laughs ]
O'Leary: Okay, okay.
  And so, we have
  the walk-up window.
and also, though, they have
  a really unique foodie market.
Is your
  San Francisco store
different from your
  Venice Beach store?
It's a walk-Through,
  brick-and-mortar location.
It has more flavors. You --
How many square feet?
San Francisco
  is 800 square feet.
This is a mock-up,
so you could kind of
  generally see
what is
  a bread-pudding parlor.
So, you're a yogurt store
  with bread pudding?
and I'm a mover
  and a shaker.
Okay, so here's
  a problem right now, all right?
The way to look at it
  is dollars per square
  foot of sales.
Correct.
  That's how you can become
  a franchisable business.
Your first concept
  was to open up 140 square feet,
and you were actually
  selling $1,300 a foot,
which is
  very, very good.
It was.
  Okay?
Then you moved
  to San Francisco.
Based on
  the first 3 months,
you've dropped
  from $1,300
down to $450
  per square foot of sales,
which is not good.
You're not gonna make
  any money this year
if that store
  stays at that level,
'cause you got to pay people,
  and you have to pay the rent.
And you've got $200,000
  of capex to amortize.
What happened between
  Muscle Beach and San Francisco?
It's a whole new Market.
Muscle Beach
  has the foot traffic.
Then I moved
  to San Francisco.
People haven't heard
  about me.
I have spent no money
  in marketing whatsoever.
Cuban: Let me
  ask you a question.
How much money
  have you invested?
I have put in $300,000.
  Whoa.
I'm curious.
  Where did you get that money?
It was from my dad, and that's
  why it's his name -- Schulzies.
And as he passed, it was a gift,
  and I invested it all.
That was the total amount
  he left you?
Yes.
And absolutely delicious.
Right.
  Cuban: Amazing.
But I couldn't imagine making
  money with you, for some reason.
I'm gonna have to trust
  my instinct on that. I'm out.
And there is not a question
  in my mind
that this isn't
  just about a business.
This isn't about a product.
This is about an empire.
Your passion for the product
  is fantastic.
I don't think you did
  a -- a great job
in showing me a business plan
  that I can get excited about.
It's there.
It's not.
  The direction's there.
Go where there is no path,
  and leave a Trail."
You could be on the brink
  of something fantastic,
but I wish
  you were more there.
I-I see you
  as teetering right now.
For me, it's not the right time
  to invest in your company.
And so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Okay.
Great product.
Greiner:
  Yeah, great product.
I want to get up
  and go try more.
To hear them tell me
and my 1-year-old daughter,
  Milla,
and I am the proud owner
  of Paparazzi Proposals.
I've been
  a paparazzi photographer
for the last six years
  in New York City.
Being a paparazzi photographer
has really helped me
  in building this business.
I don't get flustered
  under pressure,
and no matter what happens,
we're always gonna get
  that shot.
I'm amazed that no one's really
  come up with this idea before.
Since we've started it,
  there's a lot of companies
that are trying to copy
  what we do,
but no one can capture the
  moment like Paparazzi Proposals.
Tickle, tickle,
  tickle, tickle. Yeah.
I've risked a lot
  to make this dream come True.
I gave up a very stable, steady
  job. I have a young family.
We have another child
  on the way,
and so I have a lot riding
  on the success of this business.
We're really hoping
  to get a deal with the sharks.
I hope that the romance
  of it all
will manage to sweep
  a few of them off their feet.
and I'm the proud owner
  of Paparazzi Proposals.
We are asking for $250,000
  for 20% equity in our company.
I've been
  a paparazzi photographer
for the last six years,
and now I use
  these sneaky skills
to help capture
  that amazing question
that every girl wants to hear.
Paparazzi Proposals came about
four years ago
  when I proposed to my wife,
and after we started to tell
friends and family
  about our engagement,
the first question
  that everybody asked was,
"How did he do it?"
this got me thinking.
It would have been so cool
  to have some pictures
of me down on one knee.
So, I started looking into it
  and researching to see
if there was anybody
  or any company out there
offering this unique service,
  and there wasn't.
So, in June 2011,
  we launched Paparazzi Proposals.
And I've spent
  the last two years
marketing and branding
  this unique company in America.
So, sharks, it just leaves me
  with just one very big question
that I need to ask you.
I'm rather nervous about it.
[ laughter ]
Which one of you sharks
will marry Paparazzi Proposals?
[ laughter ]
Get off your knees.
  Let's talk about money.
Okay, why do you need
  a quarter of a million dollars?
We've really been focusing
  this business
in New York City
  where I'm based,
and we want
  to use that money
to help expand
  into other cities.
The other angle
  that we've done
is we go into jewelry stores,
and we educate the jewelers
  about our service.
The key success to this
is getting jewelers excited
  and on board
and wanting to put this
  into their clients' hand
as they give them
  their engagement ring.
What's in it for them?
We offered a kickback
  for the jewelers to start with.
With the social marketing
  and the media that's out there,
this is a great product
for a jeweler to advertise
  their -- their product.
Okay.
  What were your sales?
We did just under $100,000
  in sales in the last two years.
Why are you so focused
  on the jewelers?
'Cause I think
  it's key to the success.
Why not wedding shows?
  Why not wedding magazines?
Oh, yeah, 'cause lots of guys
  watch those.
"Oh, wait, the game's up,
  but I'm gonna get proposed."
  Well, no,
  but hang on, Mark.
"Let's turn on
  the Wedding Channel."
Well, you know, I see
  this as, like, a cross
  between a private eye...
Yeah.
  ...and a wedding
  photographer...
Yeah, good analogy.
  ...because it has to look
  really good, quality.
Exactly.
  But they
  have to hide out.
The main idea is, guys need help
  planning their proposals,
so we find out his ideas,
where -- w-where and how
  he might be looking to propose.
We offer him help
  with any kind of logistics,
if he wants flowers there.
So you give them
  suggestions.
  Yeah.
You aid with flowers
  or something romantic,
and then you also are there
  to capture the moment.
Exactly.
Part of the reason
that we're looking
  for investment
is also to partner
  with someone
who may be able
  to put us into Kay's and Jared.
That'd be a huge, huge, huge,
  enormous mistake,
because if you did,
and they put it in 20 stores,
  you're dead, right?
Really?
Because how are you
  going to keep up?
Let's just say they brought you
  five deals a week,
and you're in charge
  with managing, quality,
and making sure they're all
  fulfilled properly...
  right.
...and following up
  and making sure that
  everything works, right?
Exactly.
  A business
  can die from success.
Well, but he also
  could handle it.
Oh, there's no way,
  there's no way.
  Wait, wait.
In a service-oriented,
  creative business,
if you make a deal
  with a big retailer
who's gonna put you
  in 20 stores,
you don't have time
  to figure that out.
But wait a minute,
  time out. Time out.
  And that's a great way
  to lose customers.
O'Leary: I don't know
  why you guys are fighting.
No one's even talked
  about the fact
that he's asking
  over a million-dollar
  valuation of this idea.
Whoa, Kevin. Why is it worth
  that much money? $1.2 million.
It isn't. It isn't. It isn't.
  There's so much competition.
  Greiner: Wait.
My point is is that he
  could easily scale this
  fast and quick.
You'd get crushed.
Now, look. I love
  two industries very much.
I love weddings,
  and I love people dying.
You know why?
Because when both
  of those happen,
people make stupid decisions,
  emotional decisions,
not financial decisions.
And because
  that is the case,
there's huge industries
  behind both of those,
including a whole ton of
  wedding photographers out there
that could
  easily do this.
And I don't really see you
  being significantly different.
You are not worth
  $1.25 million, my friend.
Okay.
  I'm out.
Thank you very much.
and it truly can grow,
  like Lori seems to think...
  Yep.
...then you could make
  a boatload of money in New York,
then move to Chicago,
boatload in Chicago,
  then move to L.A.,
rather than trying to hit
  all these cities at one time.
Right.
  And so, because
  I don't think
this is
  an investment conducive
to my getting a return,
  I'm out.
Okay, thank you
  very much for your time.
You're welcome
  very much.
and this is not a business
  for an investor.
This is your business,
  your concierge service.
I can't imagine
  making money on this business
as an outsider
  coming in.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you,
  again, Barbara.
You're welcome,
  my friend.
You know, I think the idea
  is amazing.
Thank you.
  I think
  it's a home run.
The romantic in me,
  and I think, Barb, you -- You --
Romantic, too --
  I'm not a romantic,
  definitely not.
Well,
  the romantic in me --
I think this is fantastic.
To have a memory
  of your proposal is great.
The problem that I have
  is your valuation.
I don't see where you need
  the $250,000.
That's my problem...
  okay.
...because I don't think
  that you need to put
a lot of money
  into this business at all.
How's he going to train
  all the jewelers that you
  thought was a great idea?
I still think
  it's a great idea.
  How is he gonna
  train them
and send people
  to introduce it?
  And I think you should go
  to tuxedo places.
I'll tell you
  the difference.
When I started, I,
  just myself, figured it out.
And you know what, Mark?
  I pounded the pavement.
I went, 21 cities, 18 days.
  You're -- You're
  missing the point.
You're being a hypocrite, Lori.
  Lori, you're being a hypocrite.
  No, I'm not
  being a hypocrite.
Yes, you're saying he's got
  the right idea to scale --
  but you're being rude
  because you're interrupting me.
You're saying he's got
  the right idea to scale,
but then you're telling him
  he doesn't need the money.
Wait.
  But you've got to go out
  and train everybody.
Wait, wait.
  No, you're saying that.
That's not
  what I'm saying.
  You said it.
You're interrupting me.
  So you haven't even heard
  what I'm saying yet.
I heard
  what you said earlier...
  No, you need to stop.
...that it was a great,
  scalable idea.
  Time out, Mark.
So, he doesn't have to go
  to these other cities --
But --
  Okay, so let's just say
  within New York,
all the different
  jewelry companies.
But you know what?
  You -- but you said
  it was a great idea
to go
  to the different jewelers.
  He finds who is --
Who -- Who's the top buyer
  for Kay jewelers.
He finds
  who's the top buyer.
  What's a buyer gonna do?
It's the people who sell it
  that are gonna do the work.
What I'm saying is, he goes in,
  he sells it to them.
They get
  their staff enlisted.
The staff then --
  are you kidding me?
No, I'm not kidding you.
  I did it myself.
So the buyer -- the buyer
  of a jewelry company...
  mark.
...is gonna go to the people
  who run the retail floor...
  I went --
...and tell them
  to train the retail sales people
to sell the service.
  Yes, absolutely.
If it's an initiative
  that that store wants to do,
and they make a kickback,
  absolutely.
I've seen it done
  all the time.
  O'Leary: Why are you
  fighting about this
when the whole business
  isn't worth $250,000?
  Look. Wait.
I just wish you'd come in here
  with a different offer.
You simply say to him,
"I'll give you $250,000
  for 250% of this company."
[ laughs ]
  That's the only way
  you can do this deal.
For me
  to give you $250,000,
I would want
  a lot bigger piece of the pie.
Narrator: Three sharks are out.
Lori seems interested,
how to take this business and
  quickly get it off the ground
without needing
  a big staff.
So, I will
  make you an offer.
Okay.
I'm offering you
  $250,000,
but I'm gonna want 50%
because I see us winding up
  being equal partners.
and yet you've
  just got that offer.
Are you
  out of your mind?
It doesn't make sense that you
  wouldn't take that offer.
'cause this has been
  my heart and soul for two years.
This has to work.
But part of the reason
  this has to work
is because I have to believe
  and trust in myself.
I have to hold my head high,
  and I have to respect myself.
50% equity, it's just
  not gonna work for me.
So, if there's
  a negotiation
that we can maybe start
  to do a little dance --
Well, the negotiating works
  with you making a counteroffer.
I think there's a different way
  to structure it, Lori.
Oh, no question you think
  there's a different way
  to structure it.
And so let me explain
what would be more interesting
  for your money,
because I'm very married --
  married --
  Ohh!
I'm very married to mine,
  and we're very happy together.
You know how you know
  it's a bad deal?
No, it's gonna be
  a great deal.
  Kevin's talking.
Do you want to
  hear it, or not?
Sure, why not?
  Greiner:
  I want to hear it.
Okay.
  I'll go in with Lori.
And I'll slightly change
  the structure, all right?
  [ laughs ]
We will give you $50,000
for a third of the business,
  all right?
That's the equity piece.
And we'll loan you
  $200,000 as you need it.
That way, we can actually
  make a deal that makes sense
because your deal doesn't.
and loan you the rest
  as you need it
to expand
  the business.
So, I've got
  a counteroffer for you.
Lori, partner with Robert,
  and we'll do a deal.
'cause Lori brings so much
  to this table.
Do you
  not want my offer?
I don't not want it.
I would just like to see
  what Lori thinks about that.
Do the deal with Lori. Robert,
  let her do the deal with Lori.
So, my offer isn't good enough
  unless I bring Lori in.
  No, no, no, not at all.
But I'm
  a stopgap for you.
Yeah, you're the girl
  that didn't get the
  proposal, but don't worry.
Stay -- stick around
  in case the first one says no.
I'm -- I'm not good
  at playing second fiddle.
I thought I made you
  a very fair offer
when these guys didn't give you
  the value you deserve today.
Take it or leave it.
Thank you.
I will give you an answer
  very shortly.
Ohh!
and I had to tackle
  everything to get out
  there in the market...
we already heard that story,
  Lori. What are you gonna do?
...to build
  a $500-Million brand.
  We've heard this story already,
  Lori. What are we gonna do?
So he's going to benefit greatly
  from what's right here.
What I know
  that you can do --
James, you lost -- You lost
  one offer because you -- You
  weren't clear and concise.
This is like
  a marriage proposal.
Would the deal go down to 30%,
  we have a deal.
Because I know it's 33.3%,
  but I came in here 30%.
We're good
  with that.
  We're good with that.
Done.
  Who wants the ring?
[ laughs ]
  we get the ring.
Herjavec: Wow.
  What?
  O'Leary: I'll give it
  to my sharkette partner.
I don't get that.
Thank you for marrying
  Paparazzi Proposals.
Ah! Thank you.
Thank you so much.
  I really appreciate it.
I think
  I'm going to cry.
Thank you.
  Thank you very much
  for taking the time.
Thank you. Good luck.
  I really appreciate it.
Corcoran: Good luck.
  Thank you.
'cause I was really going
  after Lori and maybe Robert,
but Robert got his knickers
  in a twist
and decided
  to go home early.
Greiner:
  I'm making a proclamation.
A year from now,
  this is gonna be huge.
And you know, Lori,
  he saved your Butt.
Him restructuring
  the deal --
You were about to go down that
  path and make a stupid deal.
No.
  Thank god he jumped in,
  definitely.
I never make deals
  that I think are stupid.
  I hate to admit it,
  but he did.
He got you
  the right deal on that.
  I do what I believe in.
Barbara, kiss the ring.
Narrator: Last season,
  Rabbi Moshe Weiss made a deal
with Daymond for his ipad
  accessory, the soundbender.
It clips right onto the back
  magnetically, beautifully,
reflecting the sound
  right towards you.
Narrator: Let's see
  what he's doing now.
Weiss: Who would have thought
  that, in only one year,
a Rabbi
  from St. Paul, minnesota,
would be flying down
  to New York City
for a sales meeting
  with Daymond John?
Daymond!
  [ Laughs ]
Moshe, welcome
  to new York, man.
It's good
  to see you, Buddy.
How you doing?
  I'm great, man.
Before "Shark Tank,"
  Sales were at $7,000.
Post "Shark Tank,"
  we're nearing $250,000.
So one of the reasons
  I brought you out here today
was to talk about licensing
  and introduce you
to Scott
  at The Wish Factory.
Licensing is an amazing
  opportunity for soundbender.
You get a large company
to basically
  do all the work for you,
manufacture it,
  bill it, ship it,
and every quarter,
  you get a check.
So, Moshe, I wanted to introduce
  you to The Wish Factory team.
So, in anticipation
  of your coming here today,
we've done a little bit
  of ground work.
We're going to take
  Marvel's "Avengers"
And marry that
  to soundbender.
Wish Factory's
  gonna guarantee to sell
$2 million
  worth of soundbenders a year.
That's the minimum guarantee.
You are my superheroes.
We're thrilled
  that you're thrilled.
Weiss: Having a partner
  and mentor like Daymond John
is a dream come True
because he's all about you
and building the brand
  within you.
All right.
  Awesome, man! Whoo!
Done deal.
  [ laughs ]
Narrator:
  Next up is an innovative way
  to communicate with babies
before they're even born.
Hello.
  My name is Curtis.
And I'm Matt.
And we're the founders
  of Bellybuds.
Today, we're seeking
  an investment of $500,000
in exchange for 12 1/2%
  of our company.
[ scoffs ]
and this is our lovely friend,
  Danielle,
who happens to be
  6 months pregnant.
Now, we've all heard
  that playing music
to a baby in the womb
  can be beneficial,
but there's never been
  a product
designed specifically
  for that task, until now.
Bellybuds.
  [ laughter ]
Bellybuds is
  a baby Bump sound-System
that gently
  and discreetly adheres
  to a pregnant woman's belly
and allows her to play music
  and voices to the baby
in the womb anytime,
  anywhere.
Thank you, Danielle.
Wow.
  So, when my wife was pregnant
  with our oldest daughter,
she used what she had, which was
  her regular, tiny earbuds,
and pressed them
  to her stomach.
But those are made
  for your ears, not your belly.
So, that's where the idea
  of Bellybuds was conceived.
Curt came up, approached me,
  and asked
if I would like to be
  a partner with him on this.
I, of course, thought two guys
  selling a pregnancy product --
How could I resist?
[ laughter ]
But then I read the studies
  that are out there,
and not only do babies
  hear inside the womb,
but they actually learn
  and form memories, as well.
For example, if you play
  certain songs with Bellybuds
while you're pregnant,
  you can play those same songs
after the baby is born
  to help soothe them.
So it suction-cups
  to her stomach.
Is it like
  a traditional earbud, or --
WILLIAMS: It's -- Yeah, it's
  actually not a suction cup.
It's a medical-grade,
  hydro-gel adhesive.
Each pair lasts
  for about 20 uses,
and then each package comes
  with replacement adhesives,
and then we also sell
  those as a separate sku.
Matt, can I see
  one of your packages there?
O'Leary: You g-- You guys
  must have a lot of sales
  for this valuation.
It's a $4 million company.
Williams: Yes.
  Von waaden: Yes.
Our sales in 2012
  were about $300,000.
To date, the first half
  of this year,
we're at about $340,000.
We are approaching
a $1.1 million
  gross product sales.
And what's your profit
  on that?
We're, uh, running
  a negative.
Bad answer.
  Well, we're -- We're
  a growing company.
And, you know, every dollar
  that we make,
we're reinvesting
  into our company.
How much did you lose
in the first year
  and the second year, so far?
First year,
  we lost $175,000.
[ whistles ]
  2012,
  we lost $140,000.
Why are you
  losing money?
Well, we learned a very valuable
  lesson last year.
I think you're about
  to learn another one.
Yeah, well, we made a couple
  of unfortunate sales
at the beginning
  of last year.
We were --
  What is
  an unfortunate sale?
Williams:
  It's selling to buyers
who said they were going
  to distribute the product
  in a certain place,
and it ended up being online,
  undercut the price,
and it undercut
  our sales ourselves,
and then
  all our retailers.
Oh, so your retailers
  freaked out.
  Yeah.
What did they do?
Because that means that you had
  some upset retailers.
Yeah, well, they
  were wondering about our
  control of the product,
so we made the decision
  to stop selling
in order to let all those units
  flush out of the market,
'cause we wanted it to
  be over quickly rather
  than draw it out.
The lesson we learned,
  obviously,
was we need
  to know our customers better.
So we contacted
  our existing customers,
told them our plan.
They were happy with us.
  They stayed with us.
And since
  that has happened,
we've seen our sales
  again go back up.
That's fair enough.
  Good for you.
  Good recovery.
Greiner: So, a good question is,
  what do they sell for?
The retail price
  is $49.99.
And what's your cost to make
  an individual package?
Less than $10.
Do you have
  a patent on it?
We are patent pending
  right now,
as well as we have
  several registered trademarks,
and we own our --
Well, the trademarks
  won't save you
as far as
  somebody else making this.
  Fair enough,
  fair enough.
What about competition?
There are similar products
  on the market.
We are, far and away,
  the coolest.
All three of my kids, you know,
  going on ten years ago,
we would do this,
  not that that's a --
Herjavec: Did you use
  a different product?
Yeah, we used
  a different product.
There -- There are other things
  out on the market.
You know, most of them are belts
  or straps or wraparound.
If mark has already
  bought something
that was not the exact same,
  but similar function...
Functionally,
  functionally.
...then why would you think
  you'd get a patent?
Williams: Well, it's never been
  done with adhesive before,
and what that allows is that
  you can move them anywhere.
A lot of times, mom will know
  where the baby is.
'cause every
  other thing is --
  So, how long
  has it been pending?
Uh, three years.
  Three years.
Conservative approach.
  So you probably
  aren't going to get a patent.
Let's assume it
  conservatively that you're
  not gonna get a patent.
Okay.
  You have a brand
  some people know.
You've been selling some.
You're hoping to sell
  a million this year.
You come in here
  asking for $500,000.
I don't know
  what this company's worth today.
It's never made any money.
In my book, that kind of matters
  a little bit.
How did you get
  to the $4 million?
The first thing
  that we have is,
you know, roughly
  $110,000 in cash.
Okay, so I deduct that
  from the $4 million.
I'm still
  asking myself, "Whoa."
  I understand that.
"How is this company
  worth $3.9 million?"
we have $1.3 million
  sitting in our warehouse today
ready to be sold.
Inventory.
  Inventory.
So you made inventory
  before sales?
Yes.
We have high hopes
  for the growth.
  Today --
We're at the --
  GREINER: See, that's back
  to what I was saying.
We're at the beg--
  When I hear,
  "We have high hopes,
but we invested in all of this
  inventory up front"...
no, no, no, but we --
...it doesn't sound
  good to me,
so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thanks, Lori.
  Thank you, Lori.
I think your price
  of $500,000 for any percentage
is outrageous
  based on the sales.
I'm out
  truly for the numbers.
I think your whole company's
  worth 500k right now,
the whole thing.
I'm very simple to understand.
  I like to make money.
There's no way
  to make money with you guys.
I'm out.
I love the packaging.
  I love the design.
I love the story
until mark said,
"Yeah, I've been using this
  for the last nine years
with each
  of my children."
I don't think
  you did enough
to differentiate
  between your product
and all the other products
  that are out there.
We've been
  the number-One brand online
for about two years now.
And So,
  as a number-One brand,
it's equal to trailing revenue
  of $400,000.
It's a gro--
  It's an expanding market.
I don't want to waste
  your time. I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay.
  Thank you for your time.
Okay, guys. I'm just gonna be
  brutally honest.
Williams: Okay.
Any type of
  consumer-electronics product,
and particularly
  when you make it in China,
you're gonna get
  knocked off like that.
Particularly,
  you don't have a patent.
They're gonna say,
"These guys are selling them
  for $35 or $25 at wholesale.
We'll sell them
  for $10."
I think you've got
  a business here,
but I think you're
  gonna get knocked off
all the way
  to Hong Kong.
I'm out.
The good news is,
  when that child's born,
it's going to be
  an accountant.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you
  for your time.
  Thanks a lot, guys.
I think what happened
  in there was
they really liked
  the product,
and we just had a problem
  with the valuation.
But we know what's happening.
  We know the industry.
We know
  where this is going.
So, it's disappointing,
  you know.
We wish they had shared
  our vision.
Narrator: Next into the tank
  is an entrepreneur
from Camarillo, California,
with an innovative
  new cosmetic line.
and I'm seeking $200,000
for a 20% equity stake
  in my company.
Behold what could be the biggest
  spectacle in history.
What I'm about to show you
  is incredible.
Introducing...
Petpaint.
"Colored hair spray
  for your dog"?
Release the hounds!
Busting through
  your local tailgate party
is London the Bulldog.
  [ laughter ]
[ scoffs ]
win, lose, or draw,
you know
  who he's barking for.
I like the colors.
Check out Billie.
She's rocking
  stars and flowers.
And like every fashionista,
  she knows life is a catwalk.
Aww!
Petpaint is
  a veterinarian-Tested,
super bright, washable,
  easy-to-use color spray.
And with our full line
  of stencils, anyone can do it.
Even you, Mr. Wonderful.
I would love
  for you sharks
to come swim
  in this dog-eat-dog world.
Did you just
  wake up one morning saying,
  "I want to spray-paint dogs?"
HERJAVEC:
  [ laughs ]
A-Actually,
  these two are mine.
This is Billie,
  and this is monkey.
And, um, I tried to get
  a-a-a shirt to stay on my dog,
and she tore it off
  immediately.
I was like, "There's got to be
  something out there
that -- That they don't know
  they're wearing."
So a couple years of research,
  and we have Petpaint now.
Cuban: So, you say you spent
  a couple years working on this.
How much money
  have you invested?
I've got about $240,000
  invested into this.
Is that your --
  your own money?
Yes.
  Corcoran:
  That's a lot of money.
What did you spend it on?
Well, it is,
  but the majority of it
I still have
  in inventory, so --
H-How much of that
  is inventory?
I've got about $200,000
  in inventory.
  Wow.
Greiner: So, I have a question
  for you I think is important.
I'm not really sure
that something like this
  is patentable.
What happens if you
  take Winston Churchill over
  there, and you spray him red,
and he runs around the house
  against the drapes?
As long as you -- You let it
  dry, you're good.
Okay, so how long
  does it take to dry?
It's about
  20 to 30 seconds.
Okay, that's not bad.
What happens
  if a dog licks this paint?
Greiner: Yeah.
  Any damage?
We've tested it
  for toxicity,
and we've tested it
  for skin irritants,
and -- And both has -- has
  passed with flying colors.
I don't know how often people
  are gonna wake up and say,
"I want to spray-paint
  my dog blue,"
other than a holiday
  or a festive party.
How many times a year
  are you gonna turn
a little rat dog like that
  into a zebra?
Corcoran: It's fun.
  Why not?
  Herjavec:
  The zebra is cool.
Do you have --
  do you have dogs?
No, I have children.
  I don't need dogs.
Okay, it -- it may be
  a bit foreign,
but if you're super dad
and you bring your family dog
  home with stars
to your 8-year-old
  daughter's birthday,
you're gonna be the hero.
Yeah, it's very cool.
  Cuban:
  You're gonna be the hero.
Since it landed
  in my warehouse in March,
we've sold $70,000
  worth of paint.
And it sells
  for how much?
  It's $9.99.
Okay.
  Now, here's
  the interesting part of that.
So, we've got
  a 50-store deal with Petsmart.
They want to retail it, but they
  also want it in their salon.
Is this a potential deal?
  Is this an actual deal?
  Do you have any --
We're shipping
  in about two weeks.
And how much
  are you shipping?
Yeah, we have
  about 12,000 moving.
12,000 units,
  you said?
12,000 --
  I think I totaled it up.
It's about
  $12,000 worth.
Oh, $12,000 worth.
  Initial order,
  50-Store test.
Do you have the purchase order
  for the 50-Store test?
It's in my inbox.
What do you project
  the sales will be
in the next 12 months?
By close of business
  this year,
I'm looking to do
  another $120,000 in sales.
So, we should be
  right around $200,000.
  Based on what?
My distributors
  and to the groomers --
Grooming industry have reordered
  five times already.
I think it's a great idea
  for groomers.
I think it's
  very, very unique.
You know what
  I think the product lacks?
A good price.
It's $10 for one can?
I don't think
  that's an easy buy.
So, I have to see this
  as a one-time play
for halloween, maybe
  for a birthday here or there.
And I don't really see it
selling well
  at that price point, so I'm out.
I'm sorry
  to hear that.
crush their shells,
  and make purple dye.
Because it was
  such a rare color,
everybody wanted purple robes
  for royalty.
These guys would dye the sails
  of their boats purple
and sail into every war zone
  in the Mediterranean.
Nobody touched them.
  You know why?
Everybody wanted
  the purple robes.
Everybody else got killed,
  but never the phoenicians.
No one else knew how
  to crush the snails
  to make the purple Dye.
Did you
  just make that up?
  No.
Of course
  he made that up.
  That is a true story.
[ laughs ]
  I never heard that before.
  And so --
What's your point
  with that?
  This -- My point is this.
If you had the purple dye
  no one else could make,
you could sail off
  and make millions of dollars,
but you don't.
Everybody can make
  a colored spray for a dog.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
and maybe only do it
  a few times a year.
So, I hope you do
  get those sales,
but for me, I am out.
Cuban: I agree with Lori
  in some respects.
You took a big risk,
but that also shows
  your commitment.
But where I have
  a huge, huge problem
is that you weren't able
  to see that online
was your best solution.
You use social media,
  and they post pictures
of all the pets
  that they painted,
and it's self-fulfilling,
and you don't have
  all that risk.
But you didn't see that.
It's not that you can't do it.
  It's that you didn't see it.
To me,
  that's so obvious,
and then to me,
  that's a huge red flag.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
The biggest challenge, and
  the greatest asset that we have
is that it's a new and exciting
  product, okay,
so that I can spend --
  all the more reason
  why the web
would have worked
  great for you.
  It -- it would have,
but people see it
  and go, "I don't know."
are you kidding me?
All they got to do
  is take a picture.
Every kid
  with Instagram
that's -- That's
  posting pictures of their dogs,
and, you know,
  "Where'd you get it?
  Where'd you get it?"
it's so easy
  and so obvious.
That scares me
  that you couldn't see that.
There's only
  one shark left.
It's Robert.
Robert,
  what are you gonna do?
God, you know, I-I --
  usually, I'm so decisive.
Uh...
Narrator: Four sharks are out,
and they see
  cute things like this,
they're gonna
  search it out.
They would have
  found you.
I mean,
  I-I love the idea.
But are you the guy
  to take that great idea
with your current strategy
  and get it out to the market?
I don't think you'll find
  anybody better.
  O'Leary: Are you saying --
and you want
  to know something?
You'd make
  a ton of money.
But you are so stubborn
that you'd have
  to really move out of my way
and let me take over
  the sales of this...
I --
  ...because you're
  hooked to --
Mark's very most
  valid point --
The most obvious play here
  is the website,
and that's
  where your gold is.
I-I don't disagree
  with Mark.
Um, that --
  I agree with you 100%.
Barb, what's your offer
  going to be?
  Now -- but that's
  an offer, okay?
So, the -- What is your offer?
  $200,000 for 60% --
$200,000 for 60%
  of the business,
but think about this.
You don't have to do
  any work.
You just sit
  on the sidelines
and enjoy
  counting your cash.
60%, like --
I don't want to tell you
  no right off the bat,
  but I need the value.
You know what the other value
  is? Good judgment.
Yeah.
  Okay?
You don't have
  the judgment,
I think, to make
  the right plays.
You need a little help
  in that area.
And that's a big part.
  Can we -- can We --
can we step back
  a little bit?
and all the rest
  of the sharks',
and you will see
  Petpaint online.
