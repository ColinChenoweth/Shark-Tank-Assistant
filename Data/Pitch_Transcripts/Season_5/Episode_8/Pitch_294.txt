and no matter what happens,
we're always gonna get
  that shot.
I'm amazed that no one's really
  come up with this idea before.
Since we've started it,
  there's a lot of companies
that are trying to copy
  what we do,
but no one can capture the
  moment like Paparazzi Proposals.
Tickle, tickle,
  tickle, tickle. Yeah.
I've risked a lot
  to make this dream come True.
I gave up a very stable, steady
  job. I have a young family.
We have another child
  on the way,
and so I have a lot riding
  on the success of this business.
We're really hoping
  to get a deal with the sharks.
I hope that the romance
  of it all
will manage to sweep
  a few of them off their feet.
Hello.
  My name is Curtis.
And I'm Matt.
And we're the founders
  of Bellybuds.
Today, we're seeking
  an investment of $500,000
in exchange for 12 1/2%
  of our company.
[ scoffs ]
and this is our lovely friend,
  Danielle,
who happens to be
  6 months pregnant.
Now, we've all heard
  that playing music
to a baby in the womb
  can be beneficial,
but there's never been
  a product
designed specifically
  for that task, until now.
Bellybuds.
  [ laughter ]
Bellybuds is
  a baby Bump sound-System
that gently
  and discreetly adheres
  to a pregnant woman's belly
and allows her to play music
  and voices to the baby
in the womb anytime,
  anywhere.
Thank you, Danielle.
Wow.
  So, when my wife was pregnant
  with our oldest daughter,
she used what she had, which was
  her regular, tiny earbuds,
and pressed them
  to her stomach.
But those are made
  for your ears, not your belly.
So, that's where the idea
  of Bellybuds was conceived.
Curt came up, approached me,
  and asked
if I would like to be
  a partner with him on this.
I, of course, thought two guys
  selling a pregnancy product --
How could I resist?
[ laughter ]
But then I read the studies
  that are out there,
and not only do babies
  hear inside the womb,
but they actually learn
  and form memories, as well.
For example, if you play
  certain songs with Bellybuds
while you're pregnant,
  you can play those same songs
after the baby is born
  to help soothe them.
So it suction-cups
  to her stomach.
Is it like
  a traditional earbud, or --
WILLIAMS: It's -- Yeah, it's
  actually not a suction cup.
It's a medical-grade,
  hydro-gel adhesive.
Each pair lasts
  for about 20 uses,
and then each package comes
  with replacement adhesives,
and then we also sell
  those as a separate sku.
Matt, can I see
  one of your packages there?
O'Leary: You g-- You guys
  must have a lot of sales
  for this valuation.
It's a $4 million company.
Williams: Yes.
  Von waaden: Yes.
Our sales in 2012
  were about $300,000.
To date, the first half
  of this year,
we're at about $340,000.
We are approaching
a $1.1 million
  gross product sales.
And what's your profit
  on that?
We're, uh, running
  a negative.
Bad answer.
  Well, we're -- We're
  a growing company.
And, you know, every dollar
  that we make,
we're reinvesting
  into our company.
How much did you lose
in the first year
  and the second year, so far?
First year,
  we lost $175,000.
[ whistles ]
  2012,
  we lost $140,000.
Why are you
  losing money?
Well, we learned a very valuable
  lesson last year.
I think you're about
  to learn another one.
Yeah, well, we made a couple
  of unfortunate sales
at the beginning
  of last year.
We were --
  What is
  an unfortunate sale?
Williams:
  It's selling to buyers
who said they were going
  to distribute the product
  in a certain place,
and it ended up being online,
  undercut the price,
and it undercut
  our sales ourselves,
and then
  all our retailers.
Oh, so your retailers
  freaked out.
  Yeah.
What did they do?
Because that means that you had
  some upset retailers.
Yeah, well, they
  were wondering about our
  control of the product,
so we made the decision
  to stop selling
in order to let all those units
  flush out of the market,
'cause we wanted it to
  be over quickly rather
  than draw it out.
The lesson we learned,
  obviously,
was we need
  to know our customers better.
So we contacted
  our existing customers,
told them our plan.
They were happy with us.
  They stayed with us.
And since
  that has happened,
we've seen our sales
  again go back up.
That's fair enough.
  Good for you.
  Good recovery.
Greiner: So, a good question is,
  what do they sell for?
The retail price
  is $49.99.
And what's your cost to make
  an individual package?
Less than $10.
Do you have
  a patent on it?
We are patent pending
  right now,
as well as we have
  several registered trademarks,
and we own our --
Well, the trademarks
  won't save you
as far as
  somebody else making this.
  Fair enough,
  fair enough.
What about competition?
There are similar products
  on the market.
We are, far and away,
  the coolest.
All three of my kids, you know,
  going on ten years ago,
we would do this,
  not that that's a --
Herjavec: Did you use
  a different product?
Yeah, we used
  a different product.
There -- There are other things
  out on the market.
You know, most of them are belts
  or straps or wraparound.
If mark has already
  bought something
that was not the exact same,
  but similar function...
Functionally,
  functionally.
...then why would you think
  you'd get a patent?
Williams: Well, it's never been
  done with adhesive before,
and what that allows is that
  you can move them anywhere.
A lot of times, mom will know
  where the baby is.
'cause every
  other thing is --
  So, how long
  has it been pending?
Uh, three years.
  Three years.
Conservative approach.
  So you probably
  aren't going to get a patent.
Let's assume it
  conservatively that you're
  not gonna get a patent.
Okay.
  You have a brand
  some people know.
You've been selling some.
You're hoping to sell
  a million this year.
You come in here
  asking for $500,000.
I don't know
  what this company's worth today.
It's never made any money.
In my book, that kind of matters
  a little bit.
How did you get
  to the $4 million?
The first thing
  that we have is,
you know, roughly
  $110,000 in cash.
Okay, so I deduct that
  from the $4 million.
I'm still
  asking myself, "Whoa."
  I understand that.
"How is this company
  worth $3.9 million?"
we have $1.3 million
  sitting in our warehouse today
ready to be sold.
Inventory.
  Inventory.
So you made inventory
  before sales?
Yes.
We have high hopes
  for the growth.
  Today --
We're at the --
  GREINER: See, that's back
  to what I was saying.
We're at the beg--
  When I hear,
  "We have high hopes,
but we invested in all of this
  inventory up front"...
no, no, no, but we --
...it doesn't sound
  good to me,
so for that reason,
  I'm out.
Thanks, Lori.
  Thank you, Lori.
I think your price
  of $500,000 for any percentage
is outrageous
  based on the sales.
I'm out
  truly for the numbers.
I think your whole company's
  worth 500k right now,
the whole thing.
I'm very simple to understand.
  I like to make money.
There's no way
  to make money with you guys.
I'm out.
I love the packaging.
  I love the design.
I love the story
until mark said,
"Yeah, I've been using this
  for the last nine years
with each
  of my children."
I don't think
  you did enough
to differentiate
  between your product
and all the other products
  that are out there.
We've been
  the number-One brand online
for about two years now.
And So,
  as a number-One brand,
it's equal to trailing revenue
  of $400,000.
It's a gro--
  It's an expanding market.
I don't want to waste
  your time. I'm out.
Thank you.
Okay.
  Thank you for your time.
Okay, guys. I'm just gonna be
  brutally honest.
Williams: Okay.
Any type of
  consumer-electronics product,
and particularly
  when you make it in China,
you're gonna get
  knocked off like that.
Particularly,
  you don't have a patent.
They're gonna say,
"These guys are selling them
  for $35 or $25 at wholesale.
We'll sell them
  for $10."
I think you've got
  a business here,
but I think you're
  gonna get knocked off
all the way
  to Hong Kong.
I'm out.
The good news is,
  when that child's born,
it's going to be
  an accountant.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you
  for your time.
  Thanks a lot, guys.
I think what happened
  in there was
they really liked
  the product,
and we just had a problem
  with the valuation.
But we know what's happening.
  We know the industry.
We know
  where this is going.
So, it's disappointing,
  you know.
We wish they had shared
  our vision.
