Hi, my name's Abe Geary,
Geary: We have some patents
  pending on some key ingredients,
but you can't own
  color on dogs.
Corcoran: Abe, you're asking
  a hefty amount of money --
$200,000
  for 20% of your business.
Why don't you tell us
  How great your sales are?
I bet they're amazing.
So, Abe, I'm gonna tell you
  a story, okay?
4,000 years ago, there was
  a people called the phoenicians.
They found a way
  to take sea mollusks,
You're not a phoenician, Abe.
  Sorry.
What's -- What
  are you doing online?
We're not doing much online.
Why not?
I just spent my attention
  with the larger people,
with the industry leaders,
  with --
But didn't it cross
  your mind
that retail could be
  the worst possible side
of the business
  for you?
I just -- I just
  have not focused
all my attention
  onto that.
My first concern
  is when you said
that you had bought up $200,000
  worth of inventory.
You should never invest
  in inventory
until you have sales,
  because you don't know
how long you're going to sit
  with that inventory.
The other thing is,
  they might do it once,
but then they might
  grow old of it, you know,
and Robert is Abe's
  last chance to get a deal.
God, you know, I-I --
  usually, I'm so decisive.
Mark brings up
  a great point
'cause my kids
  use social media all the time,
are you saying Abe
  is not a Phoenician?
I -- You know,
  I haven't even talked
about the million-dollar value
  you put on the business today.
I'm just not
  seeing it today.
What would it take?
Hey, Abe, I'm gonna
  give you an offer.
Barbara,
  I thought you were out.
  I changed my mind.
$200,000, which you
  came in for,
but I would have to take
  60% of your business.
[ laughs ]
  Wait, don't laugh at it.
  Hold on.
But I'd be doing you
  a great favor,
because I would take over
  your social media space.
I would have you
  up with a fabulous website,
Herjavec: Abe, I'm gonna let you
  focus on Barbara.
I'm trying to get there.
  I just can't get there.
But let me --
  Let me --
  I'm out.
O'Leary: Okay, now there's
  one shark still in.
She offered you
  $200,000 for 60%.
I don't think your whole
  company's worth $200,000,
to be Frank with you,
for reasons
  I've already discussed.
But there's an offer.
  What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna take her offer
  or Not?
Look, I don't want
  to partner with somebody
who's just looking
  to grab equity,
'cause this is gonna be
  incredibly successful.
I take that as a no.
I'm gonna have to say no.
I'll see you guys
  on the internet.
Good luck.
Thank you.
[ whistles, smooches ]
Oh, my.
[ laughter ]
Well, the dogs
  listen to him.
The dogs
  are his best asset.
I couldn't take the deal
  with Barbara.
She wanted too much equity,
but I am going to take
  her advice
