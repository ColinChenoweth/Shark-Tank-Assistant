Hi, my name's Abe Geary,
and I'm seeking $200,000
for a 20% equity stake
  in my company.
Behold what could be the biggest
  spectacle in history.
What I'm about to show you
  is incredible.
Introducing...
Petpaint.
"Colored hair spray
  for your dog"?
Release the hounds!
Busting through
  your local tailgate party
is London the Bulldog.
  [ laughter ]
[ scoffs ]
win, lose, or draw,
you know
  who he's barking for.
I like the colors.
Check out Billie.
She's rocking
  stars and flowers.
And like every fashionista,
  she knows life is a catwalk.
Aww!
Petpaint is
  a veterinarian-Tested,
super bright, washable,
  easy-to-use color spray.
And with our full line
  of stencils, anyone can do it.
Even you, Mr. Wonderful.
I would love
  for you sharks
to come swim
  in this dog-eat-dog world.
Did you just
  wake up one morning saying,
  "I want to spray-paint dogs?"
HERJAVEC:
  [ laughs ]
A-Actually,
  these two are mine.
This is Billie,
  and this is monkey.
And, um, I tried to get
  a-a-a shirt to stay on my dog,
and she tore it off
  immediately.
I was like, "There's got to be
  something out there
that -- That they don't know
  they're wearing."
So a couple years of research,
  and we have Petpaint now.
Cuban: So, you say you spent
  a couple years working on this.
How much money
  have you invested?
I've got about $240,000
  invested into this.
Is that your --
  your own money?
Yes.
  Corcoran:
  That's a lot of money.
What did you spend it on?
Well, it is,
  but the majority of it
I still have
  in inventory, so --
H-How much of that
  is inventory?
I've got about $200,000
  in inventory.
  Wow.
Greiner: So, I have a question
  for you I think is important.
I'm not really sure
that something like this
  is patentable.
Geary: We have some patents
  pending on some key ingredients,
but you can't own
  color on dogs.
What happens if you
  take Winston Churchill over
  there, and you spray him red,
and he runs around the house
  against the drapes?
As long as you -- You let it
  dry, you're good.
Okay, so how long
  does it take to dry?
It's about
  20 to 30 seconds.
Okay, that's not bad.
What happens
  if a dog licks this paint?
Greiner: Yeah.
  Any damage?
We've tested it
  for toxicity,
and we've tested it
  for skin irritants,
and -- And both has -- has
  passed with flying colors.
I don't know how often people
  are gonna wake up and say,
"I want to spray-paint
  my dog blue,"
other than a holiday
  or a festive party.
How many times a year
  are you gonna turn
a little rat dog like that
  into a zebra?
Corcoran: It's fun.
  Why not?
  Herjavec:
  The zebra is cool.
Do you have --
  do you have dogs?
No, I have children.
  I don't need dogs.
Okay, it -- it may be
  a bit foreign,
but if you're super dad
and you bring your family dog
  home with stars
to your 8-year-old
  daughter's birthday,
you're gonna be the hero.
Yeah, it's very cool.
  Cuban:
  You're gonna be the hero.
Corcoran: Abe, you're asking
  a hefty amount of money --
$200,000
  for 20% of your business.
Why don't you tell us
  How great your sales are?
I bet they're amazing.
Since it landed
  in my warehouse in March,
we've sold $70,000
  worth of paint.
And it sells
  for how much?
  It's $9.99.
Okay.
  Now, here's
  the interesting part of that.
So, we've got
  a 50-store deal with Petsmart.
They want to retail it, but they
  also want it in their salon.
Is this a potential deal?
  Is this an actual deal?
  Do you have any --
We're shipping
  in about two weeks.
And how much
  are you shipping?
Yeah, we have
  about 12,000 moving.
12,000 units,
  you said?
12,000 --
  I think I totaled it up.
It's about
  $12,000 worth.
Oh, $12,000 worth.
  Initial order,
  50-Store test.
Do you have the purchase order
  for the 50-Store test?
It's in my inbox.
What do you project
  the sales will be
in the next 12 months?
By close of business
  this year,
I'm looking to do
  another $120,000 in sales.
So, we should be
  right around $200,000.
  Based on what?
My distributors
  and to the groomers --
Grooming industry have reordered
  five times already.
I think it's a great idea
  for groomers.
I think it's
  very, very unique.
You know what
  I think the product lacks?
A good price.
It's $10 for one can?
I don't think
  that's an easy buy.
So, I have to see this
  as a one-time play
for halloween, maybe
  for a birthday here or there.
And I don't really see it
selling well
  at that price point, so I'm out.
I'm sorry
  to hear that.
So, Abe, I'm gonna tell you
  a story, okay?
4,000 years ago, there was
  a people called the phoenicians.
They found a way
  to take sea mollusks,
crush their shells,
  and make purple dye.
Because it was
  such a rare color,
everybody wanted purple robes
  for royalty.
These guys would dye the sails
  of their boats purple
and sail into every war zone
  in the Mediterranean.
Nobody touched them.
  You know why?
Everybody wanted
  the purple robes.
Everybody else got killed,
  but never the phoenicians.
No one else knew how
  to crush the snails
  to make the purple Dye.
Did you
  just make that up?
  No.
Of course
  he made that up.
  That is a true story.
[ laughs ]
  I never heard that before.
  And so --
What's your point
  with that?
  This -- My point is this.
If you had the purple dye
  no one else could make,
you could sail off
  and make millions of dollars,
but you don't.
Everybody can make
  a colored spray for a dog.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
You're not a phoenician, Abe.
  Sorry.
What's -- What
  are you doing online?
We're not doing much online.
Why not?
I just spent my attention
  with the larger people,
with the industry leaders,
  with --
But didn't it cross
  your mind
that retail could be
  the worst possible side
of the business
  for you?
I just -- I just
  have not focused
all my attention
  onto that.
My first concern
  is when you said
that you had bought up $200,000
  worth of inventory.
You should never invest
  in inventory
until you have sales,
  because you don't know
how long you're going to sit
  with that inventory.
The other thing is,
  they might do it once,
but then they might
  grow old of it, you know,
and maybe only do it
  a few times a year.
So, I hope you do
  get those sales,
but for me, I am out.
Cuban: I agree with Lori
  in some respects.
You took a big risk,
but that also shows
  your commitment.
But where I have
  a huge, huge problem
is that you weren't able
  to see that online
was your best solution.
You use social media,
  and they post pictures
of all the pets
  that they painted,
and it's self-fulfilling,
and you don't have
  all that risk.
But you didn't see that.
It's not that you can't do it.
  It's that you didn't see it.
To me,
  that's so obvious,
and then to me,
  that's a huge red flag.
And for that reason,
  I'm out.
The biggest challenge, and
  the greatest asset that we have
is that it's a new and exciting
  product, okay,
so that I can spend --
  all the more reason
  why the web
would have worked
  great for you.
  It -- it would have,
but people see it
  and go, "I don't know."
are you kidding me?
All they got to do
  is take a picture.
Every kid
  with Instagram
that's -- That's
  posting pictures of their dogs,
and, you know,
  "Where'd you get it?
  Where'd you get it?"
it's so easy
  and so obvious.
That scares me
  that you couldn't see that.
There's only
  one shark left.
It's Robert.
Robert,
  what are you gonna do?
God, you know, I-I --
  usually, I'm so decisive.
Uh...
Narrator: Four sharks are out,
and Robert is Abe's
  last chance to get a deal.
God, you know, I-I --
  usually, I'm so decisive.
Mark brings up
  a great point
'cause my kids
  use social media all the time,
and they see
  cute things like this,
they're gonna
  search it out.
They would have
  found you.
I mean,
  I-I love the idea.
But are you the guy
  to take that great idea
with your current strategy
  and get it out to the market?
I don't think you'll find
  anybody better.
  O'Leary: Are you saying --
are you saying Abe
  is not a Phoenician?
I -- You know,
  I haven't even talked
about the million-dollar value
  you put on the business today.
I'm just not
  seeing it today.
What would it take?
Hey, Abe, I'm gonna
  give you an offer.
Barbara,
  I thought you were out.
  I changed my mind.
$200,000, which you
  came in for,
but I would have to take
  60% of your business.
[ laughs ]
  Wait, don't laugh at it.
  Hold on.
But I'd be doing you
  a great favor,
because I would take over
  your social media space.
I would have you
  up with a fabulous website,
and you want
  to know something?
You'd make
  a ton of money.
But you are so stubborn
that you'd have
  to really move out of my way
and let me take over
  the sales of this...
I --
  ...because you're
  hooked to --
Mark's very most
  valid point --
The most obvious play here
  is the website,
and that's
  where your gold is.
I-I don't disagree
  with Mark.
Um, that --
  I agree with you 100%.
Barb, what's your offer
  going to be?
  Now -- but that's
  an offer, okay?
So, the -- What is your offer?
  $200,000 for 60% --
$200,000 for 60%
  of the business,
but think about this.
You don't have to do
  any work.
You just sit
  on the sidelines
and enjoy
  counting your cash.
60%, like --
I don't want to tell you
  no right off the bat,
  but I need the value.
You know what the other value
  is? Good judgment.
Yeah.
  Okay?
You don't have
  the judgment,
I think, to make
  the right plays.
You need a little help
  in that area.
And that's a big part.
  Can we -- can We --
can we step back
  a little bit?
Herjavec: Abe, I'm gonna let you
  focus on Barbara.
I'm trying to get there.
  I just can't get there.
But let me --
  Let me --
  I'm out.
O'Leary: Okay, now there's
  one shark still in.
She offered you
  $200,000 for 60%.
I don't think your whole
  company's worth $200,000,
to be Frank with you,
for reasons
  I've already discussed.
But there's an offer.
  What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna take her offer
  or Not?
Look, I don't want
  to partner with somebody
who's just looking
  to grab equity,
'cause this is gonna be
  incredibly successful.
I take that as a no.
I'm gonna have to say no.
I'll see you guys
  on the internet.
Good luck.
Thank you.
[ whistles, smooches ]
Oh, my.
[ laughter ]
Well, the dogs
  listen to him.
The dogs
  are his best asset.
I couldn't take the deal
  with Barbara.
She wanted too much equity,
but I am going to take
  her advice
and all the rest
  of the sharks',
and you will see
  Petpaint online.
