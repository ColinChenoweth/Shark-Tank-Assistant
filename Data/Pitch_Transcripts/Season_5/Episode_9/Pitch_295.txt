I'm Rosy.
This is my sister, Donna.
We live in Washington, D.C.,
Donna: Growing up,
we really didn't have much,
but our parents told us
that anything is possible.
I wanted to go to school
at harvard,
Rosy wanted to travel the world.
She got to study abroad.

I'm Rosy Khalife.
Both: We're the sisters behind
the company surprise ride.
Today we're raising
$110,000
in exchange for 10%

Surprise ride
is a monthly bundle of adventure
that gets kids excited
about learning.
With surprise ride, every month,
kids receive a surprise box
Can they scale?
Absolutely.
Donna: They can.
So -- So, my business-School
background basically forced us
from day 1 to create a business
that's scalable.
Greiner:

Donna, let -- Let --
Let me tell you where I'm at.

Herjavec:

Mark?
Either say yes or no.
Cuban: Let me --
Let me ask some questions.
What's your core competency?
Our core competency
