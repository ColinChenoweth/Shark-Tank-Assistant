I'm Rosy.
This is my sister, Donna.
We live in Washington, D.C.,
and we are the creators
of surprise ride.
We come from
a family of six.
We escaped war from Lebanon
and emigrated to Canada.
Donna: Growing up,
we really didn't have much,
but our parents told us
that anything is possible.
I wanted to go to school
at harvard,
and I was able to go there
many years later.
Rosy wanted to travel the world.
She got to study abroad.
And even though
We didn't have much,
we made the best
out of that situation.
Safety first.
Too often, we hear kids
complaining that they're bored,
and moms struggle
to keep their kids
with short attention spans
busy.
Our product helps families spend
fun, quality time together,
and it helps parents and kids
gain knowledge along the way.
We've risked a lot
to make this dream come true.
I gave up a great career
on wall street.
We've both refused
great job offers
to make this dream
come true.
We validated that we have
a great product.
People absolutely love
the experience,
but we need capital
from the sharks
to share the ride
with America.
Hi, I'm Donna Khalife.
I'm Rosy Khalife.
Both: We're the sisters behind
the company surprise ride.
Today we're raising
$110,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
Surprise ride
is a monthly bundle of adventure
that gets kids excited
about learning.
With surprise ride, every month,
kids receive a surprise box
of interactive activities
and all the supplies they need
to explore a new topic.
We work with experts
to curate activities
of the highest quality.
Families everywhere
want to give their kids
a good reason
to put away the video games
and explore the world
through hands-on play.
Surprise ride makes it easier
than ever before.
Sharks, we actually picked up
some of your mail today,
and your surprise rides
have arrived.
Yes! Goodies!
I love the boxes.
Thank you.
Beautiful packaging.
Oh, wow!
Oh, Robert.
Will you stop?
Look, Daymond.
It's car racing.
You always act so amazed
by everything you see.
Robert, you're gonna get
to design and model a racecar.
Vroom!
Lori,
we know that you love cooking,
and who doesn't love
chocolate?
Right.
You're gonna get to make
chocolate from Scratch
and also design your very own
brand of chocolates.
Great.
Kevin, we know that you love
photography,
so you're gonna get
a solar kit
that has you taking pictures
using the power of the sun.
Thank you.
Love it.
Daymond, we heard
that you love to travel,
so you are gonna be entering
an adventure
into the exciting city
of Barcelona.
All right.
So, you're gonna be designing
a mosaic
in the style of world-renowned
architect Gaudi
and exploring the fashion
in barcelona.
I like.
And you heard
I like to get fat?
Yeah!
[ Laughter ]
We heard that you love --
We -- we -- we --
we might have heard
that you love basketball,
so we designed
a basketball-themed ride
that has you creating
a mini basketball game
for your desk.
And then get fat.
What's a good game
without some popcorn?
I got that.
This is really cute.
I mean, I have to say, this is
an extremely well-constructed
quality surprise box.
Well, first of all,
thank you very much.
Very, very cool.
How much do they sell for?
It starts at $24.99
for a 6-Month or a 12-Month
subscription.
And that's per month. Right.
Per month. Yep.
And it's $29.99 if you buy it
on a monthly basis.
What are your sales?
So, so far,
we've shipped almost 800 boxes,
and we've got over 220
active members.
That's just in the last
four months.
Oh, okay.
Four months,
so you just started.
Oh.
O'Leary: Ladies,
you know in an online business,
when someone comes
into the Shark Tank
with a model like this,
the two questions
that always get asked,
and hopefully,
you're gonna know this answer --
What is your
customer-acquisition cost,
and what is the value of that
customer in profit margin?
So, our customer-acquisition
cost is $5.30.
What's the value of that
customer for 12 months?
So, for just a 12-Month period,
it's a $130 customer value.
Usually,
when Mr. O'Leary
asks the client-acquisition
question,
there's a lot
of deer-in-the-headlight,
but what a great answer.
I got to know
your background.
My background
is on Wall Street.
I actually worked
in mergers and acquisitions
for a number of years.
Ahh.
Then I left that and went back
to get my MBA at Harvard,
fell in love
with Social entrepreneurship.
You have a Harvard MBA?
Good for you.
O'Leary:
What about your sister?
I have a degree
in marketing,
so I have
a business background.
I've worked with a number
of lifestyle brands
and even some kid brands,
so --
What does it cost you
to make each box,
and where are you
making these?
We're at a 50% margin,
and that 50% goes towards
buying our merchandise,
shipping, and fulfillment.
We have a fulfillment center
in Florida
that assembles
all the boxes
and ships them
out to our customers.
Can they scale?
Absolutely.
Donna: They can.
So -- So, my business-School
background basically forced us
from day 1 to create a business
that's scalable.
Greiner:
One of the concerns --
and I say this often
to new entrepreneurs --
is don't invest too much
before you have the sales.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
We actually --
So, how much have you invested
in that is in that warehouse?
This business model
really allows us
to anticipate
the demand very close
to when we need to order
that inventory,
which is terrific, so we have
very little inventory.
Because they're
multi-Month orders.
Right.
We can actually estimate
how many orders
we're having
and --
And order accordingly.
And, I'd like to add,
we've raised $100,000
from a very well-known
tech investor --
Irwin Jacobs, who's the founder
of Qualcomm.
How much equity
did he get?
He's actually
an -- An Angel investor
in the form
of a convertible note.
So, you know darn well
that $100,000 from Irwin
and $110,000 from us ain't squat
for a subscription business.
The -- the capital
that we're raising now
gets us through
the next 12 months.
Are you sure?
Yes, and the rea--
Because in
a subscription-based business --
You know how many have
gone out of business.
Yes. We're familiar
with that.
Right?
And what's the projection
for next year, Donna?
For next year, we're
anticipating about
$500,000 in sales,
and that's
on the low end --
How many subscribers
is that?
That's 3,500.
Look, you don't have
enough money to get
to $500,000 in sales.
John: But they might
because they have access
to this other investor.
So if you have this --
I didn't get to answer
your question earlier,
but Daymond, effectively,
is doing that, which is that --
if you have this other investor,
why are you here?
Irwin invested in us.
He's a big fan
of this mission,
which is to bring curiosity
to children all over the world.
Cuban: There you just hit
the nail on the head.
There's a difference
between a mission
and having a fully thought-out,
fully funded business
that is gonna accomplish
a specific goal.
I -- so, let me tell you
a little bit
about how we plan
to spend that money.
That might give you
some comfort.
Two things we're doing --
Driving traffic to the website
and then monetizing
that traffic.
Okay, that's easy to say.
Explain.
So, the first thing is,
we've partnered with a
marketing agency,
the leading expert
on reaching moms.
What does that cost you
monthly?
It's gonna cost us $40,000 total
for the next 12 months
to reach 5 million
to 10 million moms.
John: Donna and Rosy,
I want to make sure
I heard the facts correct.
I think you said you did
800 boxes
and you have 220 members.
Would that come
to around $25,000?
Yeah, about $23,000,
$25,000.
Herjavec: It's a startup.
It's a brand-new startup.
I got it, but the startup
question here is,
you would like $110,000
for 10%.
Yep.
Yes.
So the value of the company
at $1.1 million?
Yeah.
You're an investment banker,
or at least you were one.
Do you think there's a little
extreme ask in terms of value?
So, of course, the -- the --
the classic valuation question.
This is literally
what I spent...
yes, it is
the classic question.
...every -- Every minute --
Every minute of my hours on...
Cuban:
I love that answer.
...in investment banking.
And now you have
to defend it.
We know
there are two things
that primarily go
into a valuation --
the team and the future earning
potential of this company.
This team has been working
together for over 20 years.
We work so well together.
When you say you've been
working together for 20 years,
can you explain that?
By that, I mean
we've been sisters.
Herjavec: I don't know
if that's a good thing.
I have two daughters.
They're ready
to kill each other...
Yeah.
...if they spend too much time
with each other.
We hear that a lot,
but we --
we came from Lebanon, actually,
as war refugees,
and we lived in a one-bedroom
apartment when We were kids.
We didn't have a lot
of video games and Toys
and things
to entertain ourselves,
but fortunately, our dad always
encouraged us to experiment,
try a lot
of different things.
We sort of had a crafts
store and a -- a chemistry
lab in our living room.
In our basement, Yeah.
Um, I'm a really simple
and basic guy.
When I started fubu,
I sold 800 shirts.
You know what I was worth?
I was worth 800 shirts.
You're valuing the company
at $1.1 million.
I'm out.
See, I don't quite agree
with you.
And we can debate this
till the cows come home.
My guess is,
you're gonna need
somewhere between $3 million
and $5 million
to scale this to where you have
a sustainable business.
I went to school with the girls
who founded birchbox,
which is one
of the most successful
subscription services.
Mm-hmm.
They've hit
300,000 subscribers.
But, you know, you're at a proof
of concept right now,
in my opinion.
I'm tempted,
but I'm gonna pass.
I'm out.
Okay.
Donna, let -- Let --
Let me tell you where I'm at.
Yeah.
It's a great idea,
but there's a lot
of executional risk here.
You know,
your idea of spending $40,000
to get that traffic
is a little unrealistic.
I think you're underestimating
the hustle
that this business is gonna take
to get off the ground.
But I think
you'll figure it out.
So here's my offer to you.
Narrator: Two sharks are out,
but Robert has an offer.
So, my offer is the offer
that I feel comfortable with
that reflects the executional
risk in the business.
I'll give you the $110,000
for 25%.
Lori, Mark, any other?
You were asked what were you
going to do with the $100,000.
You said $40,000
to a marketing company.
What was the rest?
What were you --
Optimizing,
monetizing that traffic
so that we can actually generate
the sales.
I think that this is
one of the finest and best-Made
gift boxes for kids
that I've ever seen.
I love it.
I know what it's like
to be a woman in business.
And I know that sometimes
it can be Harder,
but I also know that you
can make anything happen
if you put your mind to it.
I had to start
from the ground up by myself,
and I had to figure out
a lot of things,
but it was the best learning
lessons I could have ever had.
And when I look
at the two of you,
you make me think of myself,
and I think
that you can do this --
She's telling you she's
out, in like 9,000 words,
7 paragraphs.
And -- don't be rude.
Donna: Lori,
you know how to reach women.
You know how to reach moms.
You know how to reach aunts.
Doing it on your own --
That's how you're
really going to learn.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
Rosy: Lori, no.
I'm giving you
my very best advice
because that's what I think
is important here.
Lori, we need you.
Herjavec:
Donna, she's out.
To address
your theory question --
You don't have to address
anything.
Okay, cool.
I made you an offer.
Mark?
Either say yes or no.
Cuban: Let me --
Let me ask some questions.
What's your core competency?
Our core competency
is execution.
That's what I was
gonna tell you, Robert.
Wrong answer.
Wrong answer.
I'm in talk with experts,
professors --
Worst possible answer.
Worst possible answer?
Worst possible.
Come on.
The fact that you need
to go out and get
this marketing company,
you need to go out and get
this optimization company,
you need to go out
in these other companies,
means you don't have
that road to success
directly in your mind.
When you're an entrepreneur,
you've got to be able
to control your own destiny
on a number of things.
I asked you the question.
What's your core competency?
I thought you were asking me
personally, so my --
Oh, come on, now. Come on.
I-I-I'm serious.
That's a Harvard answer.
That's not a real answer.
Oh, come on.
Okay, that's fair,
but let me
tell you something.
I'm out.
This was why my offer
was so high.
You don't live
in the real world.
You live in the world
of theory.
Ladies,
this isn't kansas anymore.
I made you a generous offer
for you and for me
because I can help you.
I disagree with her.
You need guidance
along the way.
Are you staying in?
Will you do 20%?
I'm out.
I'm out!
O'Leary: Whoa!
Whoa, Robert. Whoa.
You gave me time
to change my mind.
I --
Cuban: Guys, you said
you're all about sales.
You had a sale.
You didn't close the sale.
Ladies,
I think we're all out.
Robert, if you come back in,
we'll do it.
25%. We'll do it right now.
O'Leary: Interesting.
You know what, though?
I'm not gonna do it.
Immigrant to immigrant.
No. You know what?
I -- I hear --
Oh! Boom goes the dynamite.
When somebody
makes you an offer,
a bird in the hand, right?
I made you a fair offer.
But, Robert,
isn't it smart --
if you know you're willing
to take it...
isn't it smart to look at all
your options and then decide?
...you should have
walked across, and we
could have done it.
Not always. Not always.
That's what a smart
businessperson would do.
O'Leary: Ladies...
we came in here to chat
with -- with all of you.
It's debatable.
We wanted to give you all
a fair chance.
...you've actually come into
the Lore of "Shark Tank."
You are going to become legend
because you had a deal
and you didn't close it.
You came into the Shark Tank,
poo-poo happened,
and you got a surprise ride.
[ laughs ]
You've got to turn around
and walk into the sunset.
Greiner:
Good luck, you guys.
It's over.
Thank you.
Thanks. Thanks, everyone.
Herjavec: Good luck.
Thank you.
Robert pulling away
at the end
is almost a blessing
in disguise.
It showed how serious
or not serious he was
about our business.
That's hilarious.
They talked themselves
out of a deal.
You know what? It happens.
It was their deal to lose.
