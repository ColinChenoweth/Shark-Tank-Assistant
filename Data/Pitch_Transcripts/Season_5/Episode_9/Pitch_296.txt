Julie -- Julie, how did you get
these stores?
Um, I go myself.
I am extremely aggressive.
[ laughs ] Good job.
How did you get started
in the business?
Um, it -- it is based
off of an old family recipe
of a former partner of mine
who I just recently bought out
to be a part of it.
So, you bought into
an existing company.
How much did you pay in?
About $50,000 total.
Herjavec:
Julie, what does it cost
Julie,
I love what you're doing,
setting an example
for people around the country,
around the world --
Give up a little bit,
save your money...
All right.
Julie, here --
Here's what
I've learned about you
in the short time
we've spent together.
Okay.
You're
one tough cookie.
Okay.
Right? I mean --
That's a compliment.
You know, you set yourself up
for success.
But I find it
too sweet.
Okay.
J-Just me,
personally...
right.
...I like really,
really spicy mustard.
Cuban:
Congratulations, Julie.
You have
an amazing business.
No, I-I appreciate
all of your time,
