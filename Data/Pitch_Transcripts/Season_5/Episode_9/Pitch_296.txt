My name is Julie Busha,
and my product is slawsa.
I'm seeking
a $150,000 investment
for 15% of my company.
Tell me, when was the last time
you were at a grilling
or tailgating event
and someone actually
complimented the host or
hostess on their condiments?
Well, it probably never happened
because -- Let's face it --
traditional Condiments
are Boring,
and they haven't changed
in decades.
But what if I said I had
the condiment
that will change your lives?
Introducing slawsa,
a unique cross
between a slaw and a salsa.
It's great
on your grilling fare,
like your hot dogs,
brats, burgers.
Use it as a sandwich spread
or even as a dip
for tortilla chips.
Right now I'd like for you
all to taste slawsa
and how truly slaw-some
it is.
[ laughs ] It's slaw-Some.
It's slaw-Some. Yeah.
Now, we have four flavors.
For the garlic lovers
like Robert,
we have a garlic
and a garlic spicy.
Thank you.
We have the original
and the spicy as well.
Taste it a little bit before you
decide what you want to put
on your hot dogs
or your brats.
Thank you.
This is sauerkraut mixed
with mustard mixed with...
this is a cross between
a slaw -- So cabbage --
and a salsa, so there are
some heat undertones.
What are your sales?
Uh, well,
let me tell you --
over 4,200 stores nationwide
so far
in just over
a year and a half.
Really?
Wow.
Year -- Sales for year one
is $212,000.
Sales for the finish
out of year two
is projected to be
$500,000.
Wow!
Good for you.
Whoa.
And what stores
are you in?
Major retailers.
We're in 1,500 Kroger's.
We're in all
Publix stores. We're --
Wow.
Julie -- Julie, how did you get
these stores?
Um, I go myself.
I am extremely aggressive.
[ laughs ] Good job.
How did you get started
in the business?
Um, it -- it is based
off of an old family recipe
of a former partner of mine
who I just recently bought out
to be a part of it.
So, you bought into
an existing company.
How much did you pay in?
About $50,000 total.
Tell me if I understand this
correctly.
Yes.
So, there's relish.
There's mustard relish.
There's sweet relish.
There's some garlic relish.
There's hot relish.
There's hot relish.
Right.
But those have been
pretty much on the shelves...
right.
...for the past 10, 15,
20 years, right?
Right. Right.
What you've done is come in
and say, "I'm extending
the flavor base."
There is nothing like this
out there.
Well, exactly, right?
Right, right.
You're -- You've -- You've
created a new category.
John: Category.
This is a cabbage-based --
Herjavec:
Julie, what does it cost
compared to a standard
relish bottle?
Um, well, it is gonna be
about 20% higher,
and let me tell you why.
Because a pickle relish
is basically vinegar.
O'Leary: Right.
And -- and it's a brine.
Ours is a hot-fill process,
so it is a little bit more
labor-Intensive.
So, you have a co-packer
doing this for you?
Yes.
Tell me what it costs you to
make it, what you sell it for.
It -- all the flavors right now
is $1.25.
Okay,
and you sell it for?
$2.25.
And can you tell me,
based on the buyout
of your partner,
if you're paying that person
a royalty at all?
I am.
Comes out to about .66%
to any-- to up to
a little bit over 2%.
Is there a limit to it?
There is a limit.
It is not perpetuity.
What are you gonna use
$150,000 for?
Because of the buyout --
and that is my responsibility.
I am not putting that
against the company.
That's not on the books.
Right.
That is not on the books.
It comes out of your profits,
or how do you --
No, it comes out
of my personal savings.
My husband and I have been
extremely...
...fiscally responsible.
We graduated college debt-free
because we earned scholarships.
When it came time
to buy our first house...
we bought a house
half of what we were --
The lender approved us to buy.
We've never paid a penny
of credit-Card interest
in our lives because we don't
live beyond our means.
If we had not saved up,
I wouldn't have taken the leap
to become an entrepreneur.
So that's my responsibility --
Is -- Is -- is the buyout.
I would like the money
for increased production
because I know the $50,000
I have in there
is only gonna last so long
because we are expanding
rapidly.
Are you currently
taking a salary?
I am not.
And I'm okay doing that
for a couple years,
of not --
Not taking a salary.
For a couple years?
You're gonna work --
How are you living?
Yeah, how are you living?
My husband and I saved
a -- a good amount of money.
Good for you.
Julie,
I love what you're doing,
setting an example
for people around the country,
around the world --
Give up a little bit,
save your money...
Yeah.
...and put yourself
in an amazing position
to be successful.
Yes.
You're an example
like we rarely have in here.
Thank you.
I wish I could do more for you.
You know, I love it.
I'll be a customer.
I'll Slawsa-Cize a lot,
but it's not really --
I'd like to get
in those stadiums, Mark.
But that's not enough for me
to do an investment.
I'm out.
All right.
Julie, here --
Here's what
I've learned about you
in the short time
we've spent together.
Okay.
You're
one tough cookie.
Okay.
Right? I mean --
That's a compliment.
You know, you set yourself up
for success.
But I find it
too sweet.
Okay.
J-Just me,
personally...
right.
...I like really,
really spicy mustard.
And we can go
with the spicier flavor.
I wish you all the best,
but I'm out.
Okay.
I would like to have a partner
because I've never scaled
a business
the way I need to scale this.
I'm not gonna need
my hand held,
and I'm haven't needed
my hand held for several years.
Well, I tasted the product,
and my opinion
in regards to the taste
of the product doesn't matter
because your sales
proves me wrong.
But if I'm not excited
about the product,
it's really hard
for me to get behind it.
Well, that's a shame.
I'm out.
You know,
I think you've done amazing.
The fact that you got
into Kroger --
1,500 stores --
is amazing.
And the fact that you sold well
is amazing.
Incredible.
But I, personally,
don't want to be
in the Slawsa business.
Okay.
I think it's a great product,
though.
I'm out.
Kevin,
you like to make money.
Yeah.
Cuban: Yeah.
How -- How can we sell
over 200,000 jars
with Very little marketing
in less than two years' time?
Very admirable.
No question.
I see your passion,
but 15% stake...
...you're actually not
worth that right now.
But rather than beat you up
on your valuation --
Can I -- I would
like to tell you why I'm
worth a million dollars.
Why?
To go from $212,000
to $500,000,
it would be
not very wise of me
to not project
my next year's sales
as closer to my valuation.
But think about the risk
for an investor.
Risk?
For that kind
of valuation,
it doesn't reflect the risk
in a one-woman business.
You could walk out
of the Shark Tank tonight
and get run over by a bus,
and that's the end
of this company.
Well, that's why
you would have
a-an insurance policy
on me.
[ laughs ]
Yeah, but that -- That --
then, if I do that,
I'll want to run you over
with a bus.
Right.
[ laughter ]
It's a better return.
That's what I was thinking.
I-I appreciate
the presentation,
but it's not gonna happen
for me today.
I'm out.
Okay, well --
Cuban:
Congratulations, Julie.
You have
an amazing business.
No, I-I appreciate
all of your time,
and, um -- and I will make
all of you regret this,
happily, So, thank you.
I hope you do.
Keep on going.
Thank you so very much.
All right.
Thank you.
You know what?
The fact that she scrimped,
had no debt...
fantastic.
...pays off
all her credit cards,
saved up enough money
to invest in this other
company and buy them out,
is -- Is just such an amazing
example for everybody.
[ voice breaking ] Greatness
does not come without sacrifice.
I'm taking a risk,
and I've done that,
and -- and it will happen.
