It's Jamie,
here to pitch.
Who?

Come in.
Sharks,
wouldn't it have been nice
to know who was behind the door
before you let me in?
With my product, you can.
My name is Jamie Siminoff.
I'm from los Angeles,
california.
My product is the doorbot.
I'm seeking $700,000
for a 10% stake in the company.
Consumers are currently spending
billions of dollars
outfitting their homes
with products
that work with Smartphones.
However, one of the most
ubiquitous technologies,
the doorbell, has not changed
since it was invented in 1880,

my offer.
