It's Jamie,
here to pitch.
Who?
It's Jamie.
Come in.
Sharks,
wouldn't it have been nice
to know who was behind the door
before you let me in?
With my product, you can.
My name is Jamie Siminoff.
I'm from los Angeles,
california.
My product is the doorbot.
I'm seeking $700,000
for a 10% stake in the company.
Consumers are currently spending
billions of dollars
outfitting their homes
with products
that work with Smartphones.
However, one of the most
ubiquitous technologies,
the doorbell, has not changed
since it was invented in 1880,
until now.
Introducing the doorbot --
The first-ever video doorbell
built for the smartphone.
With doorbot,
you can see and speak
with visitors from anywhere.
But I didn't invent doorbot
just to make our lives
more convenient.
It also adds needed security.
Let me show you.
Mark, let's just say this is
your house in Dallas.
You'll see on the screen here
that I'm projecting the doorbot
app for my smartphone
to make it easier
to see the demo.
Now, just like a regular call,
when someone rings
the doorbot...
[ Doorbell rings ]
...you can see them and decline
if it's someone
that you don't want to talk to
or accept and say hello
to your Visitor.
Think of it as caller I.D.
for your front door.
[ laughs ]
[ doorbell rings ]
Herjavec: Aah!
Cuban: Aah!
[ Laughter ]
O'Leary: Hey,
good-looking doorbot guy.
Hey, Mark.
It's your good friend,
Mr. Wonderful.
I wanted to have you join me
on this deal with doorbot.
I think we can get them to go
all royalties and no equity.
[ laughter ]
Mark, we know
that no real entrepreneur
is gonna accept that deal,
and now you can tell
Mr. Wonderful to scram.
And the best thing is,
you can do it
without having to be
face-to-face with him.
Now, sharks,
join me,
and the next time you hear...
[ Doorbell rings ]
...it'll be...
[ Cash register dings ]
now, who wants to be first
to ring my bell?
Jamie,
what if you hit "Accept"?
then what happens?
If you hit "Accept,"
then the light goes blue,
and then
you can talk to them.
So, your voice
comes out of it.
Your voice comes out of it.
It's got a microphone
and speakers.
Like a speaker.
So it's two-way audio,
one-way video.
If someone came up and said,
"Mm. Eyeball there,"
can they just take it off?
Because all burglars
ring the doorbell first.
[ laughter ]
You know what, though, Mark?
That's actually true.
Burglars are not usually
violent criminals.
They want to see
if someone's home.
They want the opportunity
to go into a house that's not --
that does not have
people in it.
So it's actually true.
People do ring the doorbell.
It's very hard to remove,
and we also have offered
that any customer
that has one stolen,
we will replace it
for free of charge.
And how much do each one
of these units sell for?
$199.
What are your costs
to make it?
$81.83 is our cost
landed in our warehouse
in the United States.
And do you sell it
to retailers?
So far, we've only sold direct
on our own online store.
We are launching with our first
retailer in november,
which is Staples.
We launched nine months ago.
We've done an aggregate a
million dollars in sales so far.
Good for you.
And in the last --
in the last --
You've done a million dollars
so far? Wow.
In the last month,
we've done $250,000 in sales.
Our sales have grown
month over month.
All online, Jamie?
All online, all direct.
Do you have
any competitors?
Currently, we do not have
any direct competitors.
When I say direct,
we are the first video doorbell
built for the smartphone.
Now, there are other
video doorbells out there
that go to a -- a panel.
It's not two-way, so you don't
have communication from that.
You can just see
who's there, which now --
How much
does your competition cost?
The lowest-price camera
would be, you know, $50 to $100,
up to thousands of dollars
for some of these systems.
But we're not trying to compete
with the $100,000 systems
that integrate cameras
and everything in your home.
That's -- that -- that, to me,
is a totally different market.
It's for someone
who doesn't have it.
What we're trying to do
is disrupt that market
to give that to everybody,
the nor-- to give it
to my wife, who's at home,
who's in the bedroom
with my 5-year-old.
I'm away, and at 8:00 at night
and it's dark out,
someone knocks on the door.
I like the product,
but are there bigger solutions
that can come in and kind of
push this out the door?
This category will exist.
I mean,
the doorbell will stay there.
It doesn't get trumped
by technology.
We'll drive that change.
See, I think there's a --
there's a thousand different
ways to alert.
What business is not gonna get
replaced by future technology?
But here's the problem --
It's -- It's about
being able to be nimble
and actually be part
of that change.
Amen.
Greiner:
I'm gonna jump in here.
I think that you have potential
to do a lot more with this,
but I'm not connecting to
that this does enough
at this time
to distinguish itself
as different from what else
is out there on the market
for the higher price point,
and so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Okay.
We're not comparing ourselves
to a -- a --
a cheap video doorbell
that has a little,
tiny little panel.
No one's arguing the quality
of the product. I like it.
I think you're gonna do great
with it.
But I've got to be able to say,
you know what?
When I jump in,
I've got to add enough value
that this company, instead
of being worth $7 million,
could be worth $80 million,
$90 million.
I just don't see
that progression.
But --
and for that reason,
I'm out.
When I --
When I look at businesses,
I look at the three tiers
that it could hit --
a luxury, mid-Tier,
and lower tier.
And obviously,
we understand the luxury market,
where we have the $20,000
and $30,000 systems
and all that type of stuff.
That's not for that.
The mid-Tier
is the adts of the world
that most likely
Will just add this
to their services
in some sense.
I-I'm wrestling over
where this goes in the market.
I just don't think
it's for me. I'm out.
Personally,
I'm a security guy,
so the idea of having
another access point
on my house like that
freaks me out a little bit
'cause all those --
Adt and all those other ones --
are hardwired.
I can't hack into those,
right?
So I think you've priced
a lot of value into it,
but I think my real struggle
with it is,
it's really not
an internet play.
It's a consumer device.
But you're pricing it
at $199.
That -- that price point is
gonna start dropping quickly
as your volumes go up.
For that reason, I'm out.
All right.
Well, sorry about that.
Don't send him
to my house!
[ laughter ]
It's just --
It's just you and you now.
Jamie, let's take stock
of what's happened here.
You made a few jokes
about Mr. Wonderful
at the beginning
and about the royalty structure.
Am I gonna regret that,
Mr. Wonderful?
Narrator:
Four sharks are out.
Kevin is Jamie's last chance
at a deal.
Jamie, let's take stock
of what's happened here.
You made a few jokes
about Mr. Wonderful
at the beginning
and about the royalty structure.
Am I gonna regret that,
Mr. Wonderful?
The only person left
is Mr. Wonderful.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you $700,000.
I want a 10% royalty.
That drops down to 7%
after I recoup the $700,000,
and I get 5% of the company's
equity today.
You know, we -- we have a --
a vision, I think,
to build a -- a big company
out of this,
and I can't give 10% --
someone 10% of all of our sales
'cause it'll bleed us of cash
while we really need it
the most.
I'm basically providing you
factoring capital.
You need my $700,000
for inventory.
But -- But, respectfully,
I can raise that money
through venture debt or line
of credit or something else,
so that's not the kind of
money that I'm looking for.
Then why don't you --
Then why don't you counter me
with a venture-Debt offer?
So, I would do $700,000
for a 10% interest rate
with a 3% equity kicker.
No, I'm not interested.
That doesn't -- it --
It's not -- doesn't --
It's not commensurate
with the risk I'm taking.
Honestly,
I do appreciate the offer,
but at the same time,
that money that you would be
taking on the royalty
I need to reinvest
back in this business.
What's the difference between
the interest and the royalty?
The interest is cheaper.
Yeah.
The interest
I can get rid of.
O'Leary: You can get --
I can pay you back.
Oh, so you don't like the -- The
royalty-In-perpetuity aspect?
Absolutely.
But I took the risk
up front.
I believed in you -- the only
shark, I might add, that did.
$700,000's a lot of money
up front.
It is a lot of money.
Absolutely.
That's --
That's a lot of money.
Okay, Jamie.
It's that moment
when I say you're dead to me
because you don't want to take
my offer.
I made you a very valid offer,
I think,
under the circumstances.
Respectfully, Mr. Wonderful,
we're gonna decline.
Go kick some ass, Jamie.
Thank you very much.
Good luck, Jamie.
Yeah, good luck.
Herjavec: Good luck.
Siminoff: Thanks, sharks.
Kevin, he was, uh --
I'm surprised.
He was w-wavering.
There was a moment where he
actually considered it.
I would have done that deal.
Whatever happened
to peeking through the window
and saying, "Go away"?
[ laughs ]
SIMINOFF: Mr. Wonderful
gave us an offer
for just royalties
on the company,
and I don't believe
you can build a big company
having one person take 10%
of the sales for life.
Welcome to Fire Island.
How do you like it here?
[ cheers and applause ]
Every year, I take
my most successful
"Shark Tank" Entrepreneurs
for a weekend retreat
in my summer home
in Fire Island.
This year, I've invited
Cousins maine lobster,
villy's customs,
Tom+Chee, Ryan's barkery,
Daisy cakes, the Coop,
and ride-on carry-on.
It's my way of discussing
a little business,
having a lot of fun,
and rewarding my entrepreneurs.
I've got a gift
for everybody here
that's gonna be
your bedtime reading tonight.
It's the new "Shark Tank" Book.
Every week,
millions of americans tune in
to watch "Shark Tank,"
and we never expected to inspire
so many hopeful entrepreneurs.
So we decided
to write a book about it.
All the sharks contributed
with their best ideas
on how to build a business
and make your dream come true.
[ cheering ]
These are my favorite
entrepreneurs for one reason --
they're making me money.
Our sales have increased
by $600,000.
A million dollars in Sales
and still climbing.
We have done $2.5 million
in sales in one year.
Corcoran:
These seven small businesses
Have created
over 150 new American jobs.
It's just what we need
in this country,
and I'm so proud
to be a part of that.
To the best entrepreneurs
in the whole universe.
[ cheering ]
I'm not here just to share
business expertise.
I'm here to inspire them,
believe in them,
and push them on their way.
Boydstun:
Barbara has been incredible.
She makes us think bigger
and better.
Quackenbush:
It's been an awesome time
to meet all
the other entrepreneurs
and really get new advice
about what we're doing right
and what we're doing wrong.
Lenz: We're all learning
from each other,
so it's been
a phenomenal couple days.
We love you, Barb.
Mwah!
ALL:
Thank you, beautiful Barbara!
