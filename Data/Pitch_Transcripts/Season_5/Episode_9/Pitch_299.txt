Hello, sharks.
My name is Trevor George.
I'm Blake George.
And I'm Sanford Nelson.
And our company is called
magic moments.
We're looking to raise $500,000
for a 15% equity stake
in our company.
Millions of people take photos
on their cellphones every day.
Magic moments allows you
to take those photos
and create customized products
right from your mobile phone.
The key difference
is that magic moments
lets you create these products
on the go.
No longer do you have to take
your portable camera
and find that cord
and hook it up to your computer.
No one wants to deal
with that hassle.
Magic moments
solves that problem.
But wait. There's more.
For the first time ever,
you can make money
off the products you create.
Simply upload your magic moment
to our marketplace,
share it, sell,
and make money.
So, how does it work?
Well, sharks,
it's as easy as one, two, three.
First, you take a photo,
like this.
Then, simply upload your photo
to the magic moments app,
choose a product, customize it
in our design center,
and voila !
Your magic moments
is ready for purchase.
And it's not just t-shirts.
We offer iphone cases, mugs,
mouse pads, coasters,
canvas bags,
and hundreds of other products.
There's a couple phone apps
that allow you
to upload a picture
or make a t-shirt.
More than a couple.
More than a couple.
Absolutely.
But there are none that allow
you to sell the products.
What do you mean,
sell them?
We are the first --
sell them.
So, I take a picture
of the eiffel tower
or a beautiful landscape
of detroit --
because that's
where we're from --
or maybe the fall colors
that no one will ever forget.
Do you have any evidence
 that you can get people
to take uncopyrighted images
and sell them to someone else
on your site?
Absolutely.
Give me the numbers.
There are no numbers,
necessarily.
Oh! Don't you hate it
when that happens?
Herjavec: So, Trevor,
your premise is,
I take a picture of Lori,
and not only do I want --
want it on my coffee cup --
'Cause I love Lori --
[ Laughs ] Thank you.
But I'm gonna put it
on your site,
and everybody in the world
is gonna buy that coffee mug?
That's until Lori sues
you into the stone age
for using her image
for commerce.
There is an entire community
of -- of what -- What they call
iphonographers,
or amateur photographers.
Yes.
It's like everyone has become
a photographer these days.
You should see the pictures.
It's absolutely beautiful.
Do -- do you not think that
if I take pictures of you,
your kids,
or something else like that --
You don't think that
I'm gonna have a challenge
out there in the market
if I sell it?
Intellectual property.
- Copyright infringement
laws-
 --I mean
It's a serious issue
right?
We've secured
an exclusive relationship
with a public company --
cafepress.
They're our back-end
manufacturers...
there you go.
...which means we have
global distribution.
Every image
that a user would take,
whether it's to buy
or to sell,
gets passed through
cafepress' legal team,
and they approve and deny
each one
based on a set of criteria.
Who do you think, though,
is going to be utilizing
the salable part
of this?
Well, there -- there --
There's two sides of it.
There's the personalized side --
The families, the weddings,
the dogs,
things like that.
Herjavec: Okay, Trevor.
I don't get it.
I take a picture of my dog.
Nobody knows it's my dog.
Right.
I put it online.
Who's gonna buy that picture?
No one's gonna buy that.
[ laughter ]
No one's gonna buy
a picture of your dog
because that's not
a great picture that
everyone wants to buy.
So, what am I missing?
That there's scenery
of -- of Los Angeles.
There's --
There's a -- a beach.
Why wouldn't they just go
to cafepress?
Well, we are --
We are cafepress' mobile app.
So, let's make that clear.
So they can only deal with you
on mobile -- Nobody else?
Nelson: Correct.
Blake:
Vendor-Specific, yeah.
Mobile for -- for create and buy
and create and sell.
We are cafepress' mobile app.
Cuban:
And what kind of deal
did you have to do to get them
to go exclusively with you?
We did a --
We did a licensing deal.
It's
an exclusive relationship.
We're their techno-- Technology
mobile arm.
What kind of sales
do you have?
None.
Pre-revenue.
Pre-revenue.
Sure. Sure.
Herjavec: Ohh.
Goose egg.
Did -- Did they take revenue
in your company...
No.
...or is it a straight
royalty deal?
It's a straight
royalty deal.
Blake: Yeah.
Why would they do an exclusive
deal with you guys?
When we went to make
the exclusive deal to them,
we had the technology built.
And all we had to do
was take our technology
and map it into cafepress.
Tell me what's unique
about the technology.
Well, we're wrapped
right into cafepress,
And you can create
and Buy everything
from the mobile phone.
But anybody can do that.
Not everyone can do that.
There's really only three
companies that can do that --
There's cafepress, zazzle,
and shutterfly.
John: Okay, guys.
$500,000, 15%,
you value your company
a little bit over $3 million.
You have not made
any sales yet.
Sure.
Okay.
I'm gonna
smell this out here.
That means you are
probably already in a
money-raise situation.
Correct.
You've already
taken in funding.
We're family and friends,
still.
Family and friends.
How much?
$500,000.
$500,000.
How much did they get
for that percentage?
33%.
33%.
You've already
raised this.
Correct.
One of the tests I do
as a -- as a tech investor is,
I look at this and say
you've put a value
of over $3 million
for me to enter
to give you $500,000
for 15%.
I can emulate
the same thing for --
I don't know --
$300,000, $400,000.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I don't buy your premise,
and I don't buy your valuation.
I'm out.
Fair enough.
Yep.
I think you guys need
to consider
the upside
of this massive market
and think about the fact that
this little device right here
that sits in the pocket of
hundreds of millions of people
around the world --
This is the content-creation
device of the future.
You're the first guy to ever say
that in "Shark Tank."
If I take a picture
of my cute puppy
and my goal
is to make revenue,
you don't think
I'm gonna take the time
to just transfer that
over to my P.C.
Or do something web-based,
because I --
not if you could do it all
with -- right here.
It's a whole lot easier
to do it
on a web-based interface.
I'm not doing it off my mobile
phone 'cause it's a hassle.
Because you want to maximize
your revenue,
you're -- You're not gonna care
if it's mobile.
I'm out.
Daymond, you're a branding guy,
right?
We're talking about
magic moments here.
I mean, we have a tradeMark
on the name.
That's a massive name.
In any language,
someone would understand
the name magic moments.
Magic moments --
That could be anything.
That could be, uh, viagra,
a laxative -- Anything.
[ laughter ]
until you have proof of concept
in sales And you can show it,
you're only making up
an opinion, and it's not a fact.
I think you're
missing the boat
because cafepress
is our proof of concept.
Then I'm gonna have
to miss the Boat.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Look, we know
that we have
a robust system
that works, okay?
And we're businessmen,
so if you guys like the concept,
you know, make us an offer,
and we can negotiate.
Why would somebody
want to buy the pictures
that other people take?
Everybody can do it.
I'm out.
You know, I think what you've
really defined --
If I understand it correctly --
That's unique
is the immediacy.
I don't think you've proven
that the marketplace
actually exists,
so that's my challenge
with the entire premise.
I don't see the immediacy
being the -- the real pearl
in this entire deal.
I'm out.
Okay.
The immediacy --
When we launched,
we were the first ones
out there.
We're still the only app that
allows you to sell products.
I mean, this is a --
this is a massive market.
Cafepress --
$300 million business.
Guys, that's great,
but Everybody's out.
You're done in here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, sharks.
Thank you.
The sharks missed
their opportunity now,
but that's okay
because when they
want in, they're gonna
have to pay a lot more.
I can't wait to give them
that valuation.
Ooh!
