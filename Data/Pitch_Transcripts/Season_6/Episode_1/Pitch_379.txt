STEPHANIE'S INVENTION
WAS LIFE-CHANGING.
WE KNEW IT WOULD HELP
OTHER PARENTS ACROSS THE WORLD,
SO WE LAUNCHED OUR BUSINESS.
THINGS WERE
MOVING ALONG GREAT,
Brett:
WE HOPE THE SHARKS WILL SEE
HOW TRULY SPECIAL
THIS BUSINESS REALLY IS.
MWAH!

WE'VE SOLD ABOUT 25,000.
WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?
$34.95 TO $39.95.

SELLING THEM?
Stephanie: ONLINE.

John: 100%?
100%.

GOOD FOR YOU.
Herjavec: VERY GOOD.
SO, HOW DID YOU GET THE WORD OUT
THERE ABOUT IT?
HOW DO PEOPLE KNOW
TO GET IT?
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE
COMMUNITY OF MOMS
THAT WHEN THEIR BABIES
ARE SLEEPING, THEY TALK.
WE HAVE DONE <i>NO</i> MARKETING.
Brett: GUYS, WE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE $200 A MONTH
SO MY WIFE COULD STAY AT HOME
WITH THE BABY.
WE INVESTED $700
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
TOTAL?

THAT'S IT.
BUILT, UH, A $500 WEBSITE,
GRABBED $200 OF THE FABRIC,
Stephanie:
OH, CRAP. [ LAUGHS ]

"WHAT AM I GONNA DO?"
John: WOW.

KEVIN'S OFFER.
