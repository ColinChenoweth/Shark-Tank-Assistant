I'M STEPHANIE.
AND I'M BRETT.
AND WE'RE A HUSBAND AND WIFE
FROM FORT WORTH, TEXAS.
MWAH!
[ GIGGLES ]
WHEN WE FIRST HAD CHARLOTTE,
WE WERE SO EXCITED...
[ GIGGLES ]
...BUT AS HAPPENS,
THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS STARTED.
OUT OF DESPERATION,
I CREATED SOMETHING
THAT HAD OUR DAUGHTER
SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT
EVERY NIGHT.
STEPHANIE'S INVENTION
WAS LIFE-CHANGING.
WE KNEW IT WOULD HELP
OTHER PARENTS ACROSS THE WORLD,
SO WE LAUNCHED OUR BUSINESS.
THINGS WERE
MOVING ALONG GREAT,
AND WE WERE READY TO HAVE
ANOTHER BABY.
AFTER GETTING PREGNANT,
I STARTED EXPERIENCING PAIN,
AND WE WENT TO
THE HOSPITAL
AND FOUND OUT
THAT WE HAD LOST THE BABY.
THE DOCTORS HAD TOLD ME
THAT IF I HAD NOT GONE IN,
I WOULD HAVE DIED
WITHIN 24 HOURS.
[ Voice breaking ] TO CONTINUE
ON WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL
WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME.
I HAD TO TELL MY CUSTOMERS,
"I NEED YOUR PATIENCE
AND UNDERSTANDING
BECAUSE I LOST A BABY."
AS SOON AS I SHARED THAT,
I WAS FLOODED
WITH THESE WOMEN
THAT HAD GONE THROUGH
WHAT I HAD GONE THROUGH.
IT REALLY HELPED ME HEAL,
AND THEN SOON,
WE FOUND OUT
WE WERE PREGNANT AGAIN.
EVERY CLOUD HAS
A SILVER LINING,
AND OUR SILVER LINING
WAS OUR LITTLE BOY, MAVERICK.
HI!
WE'VE TAKEN THE COMPANY
THIS FAR,
BUT WE REALLY NEED
THE SHARKS' INVOLVEMENT
TO REACH
OUR FULL POTENTIAL.
Brett:
WE HOPE THE SHARKS WILL SEE
HOW TRULY SPECIAL
THIS BUSINESS REALLY IS.
MWAH!
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHAT'S UP, SHARKS?
MY NAME IS BRETT PARKER.
AND I'M STEPHANIE PARKER,
AND WE'RE
FROM FORT WORTH, TEXAS.
OUR COMPANY IS
SLEEPING BABY,
AND WE'RE HERE SEEKING
AN INVESTMENT OF $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR
10% OF OUR COMPANY.
FOR NEW PARENTS, THE MOST
VALUABLE COMMODITY IS SLEEP.
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET
YOUR BABY TO SLEEP LONGER.
OUR PRODUCT IS
A SLEEP AND SANITY SAVER
FOR PARENTS AND BABIES
EVERYWHERE.
WHEN OUR DAUGHTER,
CHARLOTTE, WAS A NEWBORN,
WE PRACTICED
THE SWADDLE TECHNIQUE,
WHERE WE WRAPPED HER UP
LIKE A LITTLE BURRITO,
AND THE TIGHT AND COZY FIT
HELPED HER SLEEP
THROUGH THE NIGHT.
THIS OUR SON, MAVERICK.
[ CLICKS TONGUE ]
[ LAUGHS ]
HE'S ALL SNUG
IN A SWADDLE,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
LIKE MOST BABIES,
EVENTUALLY THEY BREAK OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEY START
SCRATCHING THEIR FACE,
WAKING THEMSELF UP,
AND THAT'S NEVER GOOD
FOR THE BABY OR THE PARENT.
WELL, OUR DAUGHTER...
[ CHUCKLES ]
...UH, AS SHE GOT OLDER,
BEGAN WAKING UP
EVERY 15 MINUTES.
WE WERE EXHAUSTED.
WE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO DO
SOMETHING
TO TRANSITION
OFF THE SWADDLE.
Stephanie: OUT OF DESPERATION
AND EXHAUSTION,
I SAT DOWN
AT MY LITTLE SEWING MACHINE,
AND THE FABULOUS
ZIPADEE-ZIP WAS BORN.
LIKE A SWADDLE, IT MIMICS
THE COZY, ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENT
OF THE WOMB,
BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS A BABY
TO PUSH UP AND ROLL OVER
AND WIGGLE AROUND
SAFELY AND FREELY.
I'LL SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT
HOW IT WORKS.
SO, THIS IS OUR LITTLE SON,
MAVERICK, AGAIN,
SLEEPING IN
HIS ZIPADEE-ZIP.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AND HE STARTLES,
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHT RESISTANCE
IN THE ARMS,
HE'S ABLE TO PUT HIMSELF
BACK TO SLEEP WITHOUT MY HELP.
AWW.
SO, WHEN OUR DAUGHTER TRIED
THE ZIPADEE-ZIP THE FIRST TIME,
SHE SLEPT 12 HOURS,
WHICH MEANS <i>WE</i> SLEPT 12 HOURS
THAT NIGHT.
SO, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND SHOW YOU
A COUPLE OF
OUR ZIPADEE-ZIPS
SO YOU SEE
THE FABULOUS QUALITY.
SO, WHO STARTLED THE BABY
JUST TO MAKE A GREAT VIDEO?
ME.
AH.
THANK YOU.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I KNOW, RIGHT?
I SEE YOUR PRIORITIES
ARE IN ORDER. I LIKE THAT.
I WAS LIKE, "OH, GOSH."
WHAT'S YOURS GOT ON IT, KEVIN?
MONSTERS.
OKAY, SO WHY --
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
HOW MANY OF THESE LITTLE
STRAIGHTJACKETS YOU'RE SELLING?
[ CHUCKLES ]
Brett: WE'VE SOLD A FEW.
WE'VE SOLD ABOUT 25,000.
WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?
$34.95 TO $39.95.
Greiner: WHEN DID YOU START
SELLING THEM?
UH, TWO AND A HALF YEARS,
SO WE'VE SOLD A LITTLE OVER
$1 MILLION WORTH.
OH.
WOW.
OH.
DO YOU SELL THEM DIRECT?
DO YOU SELL THEM WHOLESALE?
100% OF OUR BUSINESS
IS THROUGH OUR OWN SITE.
Stephanie: ONLINE.
WOW.
ONLINE. WOW.
John: 100%?
100%.
YES.
GOOD FOR YOU.
Herjavec: VERY GOOD.
SO, HOW DID YOU GET THE WORD OUT
THERE ABOUT IT?
HOW DO PEOPLE KNOW
TO GET IT?
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE
COMMUNITY OF MOMS
THAT WHEN THEIR BABIES
ARE SLEEPING, THEY TALK.
WE HAVE DONE <i>NO</i> MARKETING.
Brett: GUYS, WE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE $200 A MONTH
SO MY WIFE COULD STAY AT HOME
WITH THE BABY.
WE INVESTED $700
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
TOTAL?
TOTAL.
THAT'S IT.
BUILT, UH, A $500 WEBSITE,
GRABBED $200 OF THE FABRIC,
AND SAT THROUGH IT
TOGETHER.
AND WHEN IT WENT LIVE,
WE DID $200 IN FIVE MINUTES,
SHUT IT OFF,
AND MY -- MY WIFE SAID...
WOW.
Herjavec: [ LAUGHS ]
Stephanie:
OH, CRAP. [ LAUGHS ]
...MY WIFE SAID,
"WHAT AM I GONNA DO?"
John: WOW.
AND I SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
HOW TO SEW!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, WHAT MAKES THE BABY FALL
ASLEEP IN THIS,
'CAUSE HE'S NOT TIGHT?
NO. I CAN TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
OF SCIENCE BEHIND IT.
SO, UM, A BABY, WHEN THEY'RE
STUCK IN THE WOMB
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,
THEY'RE IN THAT LITTLE,
TINY BALL, RIGHT?
AND SO, WHEN THEY ARE OUT
OF THE WOMB, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THERE'S THIS FREEDOM,
AND THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED
A MORO REFLEX.
A WHAT?
A MORO REFLEX.
IT'S A STARTLE REFLEX SO THAT
WHEN A BABY PUTS THEIR ARMS OUT,
THEY KIND OF FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE FALLING,
AND SO THEY JOLT....
OH, WOW.
...AND JUST LIKE YOU SAW
RIGHT THERE.
AND SO, THEY NEED TO FEEL
THEIR EDGES,
AND IF THEY'RE ABLE TO FEEL
THEIR EDGES,
THEN THEY'RE ABLE
TO FALL BACK ASLEEP
A LOT MORE EFFICIENTLY.
SO, IT'S A WOMB-LIKE,
PROTECTIVE STATE.
EXACTLY.
OKAY, SO IF
I GAVE YOU $200,000,
COULD YOU QUADRUPLE
YOUR PRODUCTION?
IMMEDIATELY.
AND YOU KNOW WHICH SKUs
YOU WOULD DO THAT TO?
I WOULD DO IT
WITH MY NEW PRINTS
THAT I KNOW FOR A FACT
WILL SELL,
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
I HAVE ACTUALLY VETTED
THESE PRINTS
WITH ALL OF MY ONLINE,
UH, FOLLOWERS.
THEY VOTE ON THEM.
SO, THEY VOTE ON THEM.
WOW. CLEVER.
AND THEY CHOOSE
WHAT THEY WANT.
[ Voice breaking ]
I CANNOT TELL Y--
I CANNOT TELL YOU THE,
UM, COMMUNITY OF WOMEN THAT...
UM, IS PART OF OUR, UH --
PART OF OUR PROCESS.
IT'S JUST, UM,
IT'S -- IT'S MIND-BLOWING.
UM...
[ SIGHS ]
LAST -- LAST YEAR, WE, UM --
WE LOST OUR -- OUR BABY,
AND WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE
COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE
THAT WERE WILLING TO BE THERE
FOR US AND, VICE VERSA, FOR THEM
IN TERMS OF JUST FEELING LIKE
THEY COULD GO TO OUR --
OUR SOCIAL-MEDIA PAGES AND --
AND SHARE SOME OF THEIR HEARTS.
AND SO, THERE'S
NO DUPLICATING THAT.
STEPH, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR BABY.
YOU KNOW, WE -- IF --
IF THAT HADN'T HAPPENED,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE MAVERICK.
YEAH, SO...
SO, I AM SO GRATEFUL,
AND HE'S IN HIS ZIPADEE-ZIP
SLEEPING RIGHT NOW.
[ LAUGHS ] SO...
Greiner:
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.
I HAVE FOUND THROUGHOUT
THE YEARS OF CREATING PRODUCT
AND DEALING WITH A LOT
OF DIFFERENT ENTREPRENEURS
THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
REALLY PUTTING OUT GOOD
HAVE A LOT OF GOOD
COMING BACK TO THEM.
I THINK YOU'RE DOING
EVERYTHING RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
AN OFFER.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $200,000,
BUT I'D LIKE 25%
BECAUSE I THINK
THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HELP FROM ME
IN HELPING YOU TO BUILD
THE BRAND AND GET IT OUT THERE.
BUT I REALLY LIKE
THE PROOF OF CONCEPT.
THANK YOU.
FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE GRATEFUL,
BUT IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
WE'D LOVE TO HEAR SOME --
SOME OTHER THINGS.
DO YOU WANT
TO GO INTO RETAIL?
IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU'D LIKE TO DO,
OR DO YOU WANT TO KEEP THIS
AS A COMMUNITY ONLINE?
YOU KNOW, UH, A LOT OF
THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU GUYS ASK,
WE NEED TO HAVE
DEFINITIVE ANSWERS.
I DON'T KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.
YOU NEED TO HAVE
THAT ANSWER CLEAR
BECAUSE I'M THE GUY WHO WANTS TO
TAKE IT TO RETAIL, RIGHT?
SURE.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER.
SURE.
YOU'RE MAKING A CLEAN --
Y-Y-YOU'RE GONNA BRING IN
MAYBE $1 MILLION THIS YEAR...
CORRECT.
...WITH NO HASSLE OF,
UH, DEALING WITH RETAILERS
SENDING IT BACK.
YOU MAY <i>NOT</i>
WANT TO GO TO RETAIL.
SURE.
RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS
WANT TO SQUEEZE YOU
WHEN YOU GO TO RETAIL.
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
MY VISION, TOO.
AND WE'RE
OF THAT MIND, TOO.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
WE'VE NEVER CROSSED THAT BRIDGE.
SO, L-LET ME CHIME IN HERE.
UM, MY FAMILY, WHEN THEY MOVED
TO NORTH AMERICA,
THEY BROUGHT A BUSINESS CALLED
KIDDIES TOGS WITH THEM.
THAT'S WHAT
MY GRANDFATHER STARTED,
AND THEY MADE EXACTLY
THIS CLOTHING -- IDENTICAL.
REALLY?
YEP.
THEY WERE IN EXISTENCE
WHEN WE COULD
MAKE THIS STUFF IN AMERICA
AT A COST
THAT WAS COMPETITIVE,
AND WHEN IT TRANSITIONED
TO ASIA, THEY GOT KILLED.
RETAIL IS A VERY DIFFICULT BEAST
TO MANAGE.
I THINK THIS CONNECTION
YOU'VE CREATED WITH
YOUR CUSTOMER BASE IS UNIQUE.
AND IT'S --
IT -- IT'S FROM THE HEART.
IT'S HARD TO LISTEN TO YOUR
STORY WITHOUT GETTING EMOTIONAL,
IT'S SO POWERFUL.
I'D DO YOUR DEAL, UM --
$200,000 FOR 20%.
STRAIGHT DEAL. I DO NOT WANT TO
SEE YOU DIE IN RETAIL.
I'M ABOUT TO FALL OVER.
John: NO ROYALTY FOREVER?
[ CHUCKLES ]
NO ROYALTIES?
O'Leary: NO, NO, THERE'S NO --
THERE'S NO ROYALTY.
THERE'S NO ROYALTIES.
MY OFFER IS STRAIGHT EQUITY.
I HAVE A CONNECTION
TO THIS BUSINESS.
I SHOULD PAY YOU
[ LAUGHTER ]
Cuban: OH, MY GOD.
EVER.
NO, YOU -- YOU -- THIS IS MY OLD
FAMILY BUSINESS ALL OVER AGAIN
EXCEPT WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE
FIGURED IT OUT IN A NEW WORLD.
Brett:
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
SO, I'M GONNA MATCH
KEVIN'S OFFER.
WOW.
$200,000 FOR 20%.
AND ARE YOU
A RETAIL GUY?
I THINK WE'RE
GOING TO TRY IT, TEST IT.
IF IF DOESN'T WORK, WE'RE
GONNA STAY RIGHT WHERE WE ARE.
I'M STICKING.
AND WE HAVE YET
TO HEAR FROM MARK.
Cuban:
YOU GUYS DON'T NEED ME.
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU GUYS ARE
THE AMERICAN DREAM COME TRUE...
THANK YOU.
...BECAUSE EVERYBODY OUT THERE
NOW KNOWS
THAT YOUR BACK CAN BE
AGAINST THE WALL,
YOU CAN SUFFER PERSONAL TRAGEDY,
AND WITH $700,
YOU CAN BE STANDING RIGHT THERE
AND ALREADY HAVE
A GREAT BUSINESS IN PLACE
AND GET ALL THESE OFFERS.
THANK YOU.
WELL...
SO, WHILE I'M OUT,
I CAN'T APPLAUD YOU ENOUGH.
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.
Stephanie: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU. THAT MEANS A LOT.
YOU KNOW, AS MARK SAID,
YOU'RE THE PROOF.
ALL YOU NEED IS DRIVE,
YOU NEED AMBITION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
YOU NEED TO SPEND
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS,
AND IT SOUNDS
LIKE THIS IS REALLY
THE O'LEARY FAMILY BUSINESS,
WHICH I NEVER KNEW, SO...
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A FAMILY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, ON THIS ONE...I-I'M OUT.
BUT YOU'VE GOT THREE OFFERS.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?
FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU.
WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY.
ALL THE OFFERS
ARE EXTREMELY GENEROUS.
MY QUESTION TO YOU, DAYMOND,
IS THIS --
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU PROBABLY
HAVE THE MANUFACTURING
THAT YOU COULD
HELP US OUT WITH, CORRECT?
SURE. OF COURSE.
UM, AND...WE DON'T WANT
TO BE OVERLY GREEDY,
BUT FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM,
THIS IS OUR BABY.
BUT WITHOUT GOING
BACK AND FORTH,
WE WOULD DO
THE 15% FOR $200,000,
AND WE WOULD DO IT TODAY.
[ SIGHS ]
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
Narrator: TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
STEPHANIE AND BRETT HAVE
THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR BABY SLEEPWEAR
COMPANY, SLEEPING BABY.
THEY'VE COUNTERED 15%
TO DAYMOND'S OFFER
OF $200,000
FOR 20% OF THE COMPANY.
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
[ SIGHS ]
I WOULD NORMALLY WANT 33%.
I WILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO ON THIS.
GOING DOWN ANY LOWER WILL BE
CHALLENGING BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,
THERE'S A LOT OF IN-KIND THINGS
THAT COME WITH IT
BECAUSE WHEN I HAVE A STAFF,
I'M STILL PAYING THEM,
NOT -- NOT PUTTING THE COST
ONTO YOU.
I HAVE TO STICK TO MY NUMBER,
AND I'M SORRY.
I NORMALLY WOULD BE 33%.
I REALLY WANT
TO TAKE THIS RIDE WITH YOU,
BUT I HAVE TO STICK AT 20%.
LET ME
ASK YOU THIS --
DO YOU WANT TO PARTNER
ANOTHER SHARK IN THIS PROCESS?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
OKAY.
YOU GOT A DEAL, BUDDY.
BANG.
WOW.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
WHOO! AH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: MY CONGRATULATIONS.
John: I LIKE THAT.
I WAS WORRIED, TOO.
"YOU WANT A PARTNER?"
"NO."
"GOOD! ME NEITHER."
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
I LOVE THAT YEE-HAW.
[ CHUCKLES ]
[ CHUCKLES ] YEAH.
OH, MY GOSH.
I'M GONNA PASS OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
YEAH.
WE KNEW THAT WE WANTED
TO DO BUSINESS WITH DAYMOND.
YEAH, HE KNOWS HIS STUFF
IN THAT INDUSTRY,
AND SO WE'RE SO EXCITED
THAT WE HAVE SOMEONE
THAT'S BEEN THERE, DONE THAT,
AND CAN LEAD US THROUGH THE NEXT
MILLION YEARS OF ZIPADEE-ZIP.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Corcoran:
TODAY, WE'RE AT TARGET TO SEE
OUR BRAND-NEW
"SHARK TANK" DISPLAY
WITH SIX OF OUR
"SHARK TANK" PRODUCTS.
AND WE'VE INVITED OUR SIX
GREAT ENTREPRENEURS HERE
TO SEE THE DISPLAY
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THEM.
I'M EXCITED FOR US.
I MEAN, THIS IS TARGET.
[ CHEERS ]
HEY!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
FROM MY END, WE HAVE KaZAM,
WE HAVE LOLLALAND, U-LACE,
KISSTIXX,
AND WE HAVE MONKEY MAT.
AND I'VE BROUGHT IN
RYAN'S BARKERY,
NOW KNOWN AS RY'S RUFFERY.
A THOUSAND STORES
ACROSS THE U.S.
WITH THIS
BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A MAGICAL DREAM, RIGHT?
SEEING MY PRODUCT AT A TARGET
PRETTY MUCH TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.
Lugo:
THIS IS WHAT I HAD ENVISIONED
BEFORE I WENT ON "SHARK TANK,"
AND NOW, JUST A YEAR LATER,
IT'S HAPPENING.
THIS REALLY SHOWS YOU
THE POWER OF "SHARK TANK"
AND THE KIND OF HUGE DEAL
A SHARK CAN BRING TO THE TABLE.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
PRETTY MUCH ALL OF YOU GUYS
STARTED IN A BASEMENT,
A KITCHEN, A GARAGE.
YOU GUYS HAVE HIT
THE BIG TIME.
"SHARK TANK" PROVES THAT IF
YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA,
AND YOU'RE WILLING
TO WORK LIKE CRAZY,
YOUR DREAM CAN COME TRUE.
I DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE.
I WAS LIVING
IN A FRIEND'S HOUSE.
SINCE "SHARK TANK,"
THE FUTURE IS TRULY BRIGHT.
Turich: "SHARK TANK" HAS
OPENED UP SO MANY DOORS FOR US,
AND MONKEY MAT'S BECOMING
A HOUSEHOLD NAME.
Hanna: IT'S SURREAL.
WE FINALLY HAVE
THE BRAND RECOGNITION
TO SELL THROUGH
AT A PLACE LIKE TARGET.
Buonomo: BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
WE ONLY HAD $70,000 IN SALES.
TWO AND A HALF YEARS LATER,
WE'RE APPROACHING $2 MILLION.
Cuban: WE DID THE MATH.
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
ALL SIX COMPANIES COMBINED --
ABOUT $1.3 MILLION
IN SALES.
POST "SHARK TANK" --
$7.7 MILLION IN SALES.
THAT'S A 500% INCREASE.
"SHARK TANK" ON THREE.
ANYBODY WHO TELLS YOU
THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS NOT ALIVE AND WELL
HAS NEVER WATCHED
"SHARK TANK."
WE SEND A MESSAGE
EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT ON ABC
THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS ALIVE AND WELL.
Together:
THANK YOU, MARK AND BARBARA!
[ CHEERING ]
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A UNIQUE
CONCEPT IN MEN'S GROOMING.
