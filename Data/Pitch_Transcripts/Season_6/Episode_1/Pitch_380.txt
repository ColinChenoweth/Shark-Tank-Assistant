HI, SHARKS. I'M DAVID.
AND I'M RANDY.
OUR COMPANY IS BOMBAS,
AND WE'RE HERE TODAY
SEEKING $200,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR A 5% EQUITY STAKE.
BOMBAS ARE
ATHLETIC LEISURE SOCKS
ENGINEERED TO LOOK BETTER,
FEEL BETTER,
AND WITH A MISSION
TO HELP THOSE IN NEED.
THE MASS-MARKET ATHLETIC SOCK
HASN'T CHANGED IN DECADES --
SAME BASIC COLORS,
SAME STYLES,
SAME CARDBOARD FEEL --
UNTIL NOW.
WE SPENT TWO YEARS
ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AND CAME UP WITH
SEVEN SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
TO THE ATHLETIC SOCK.
THE RESULT IS
THE MOST THOUGHTFULLY DESIGNED
AND COMFORTABLE PAIR OF SOCKS
YOU'LL EVER WEAR.
BUT THE STORY OF BOMBAS
GOES WAY BEYOND
REENGINEERING
THE ATHLETIC SOCK.
WE LEARNED THAT SOCKS
ARE THE NUMBER-ONE
MOST REQUESTED CLOTHING ITEM
AT HOMELESS SHELTERS.
THAT REALLY STUCK WITH US,
SO FOR EVERY PAIR OF SOCKS
WE SELL, WE DONATE A PAIR.
SO, WE HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US
TO MAKE BETTER SOCKS
FOR A BETTER WORLD.
WE BROUGHT SOME SOCKS WITH US
TODAY FOR YOU GUYS TO TRY ON.
THANK YOU.
SURE. ABSOLUTELY.
HERE YOU GO.
DO I GET THESE?
THOSE TWO.
THANK YOU.
THESE TWO ARE FOR YOU.
SURE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
APPRECIATE IT.
SURE.
Heath: WE'D LIKE TO TAKE
A QUICK MOMENT WHILE YOU'RE
TRYING THEM ON
TO TAKE YOU THROUGH OUR
SEVEN SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS.
WE STARTED
WITH PERUVIAN PIMA COTTON.
THIS IS A NATURAL FIBER
THAT WICKS MOISTURE, BREATHES,
STAYS WARM IN THE WINTER,
AND COOL IN THE SUMMER.
UP BY THE TOES,
WE GOT RID OF THAT ANNOYING SEAM
THAT'S ALWAYS
CAUSING IRRITATION,
CREATING OUR INVISITOE.
IN THE MID-FOOT AREA,
WE CREATED
OUR PROPRIETARY HONEYCOMB
ARCH-SUPPORT SYSTEM
AND ADDED OUR ULTRA-COMFORTABLE
PERFORMANCE FOOTBED.
AND BACK BY THE HEEL,
WE CREATED A Y-SHAPED STITCH
TO CREATE A NATURAL CUP
AROUND YOUR HEEL
AND ADDED A BLISTER TAB
FOR THE ANKLE SOCKS.
Herjavec: SO, DAVE AND RANDY,
I'M A BIG RUNNER.
I GOT TO TELL YOU -- SPECIALTY
SPORTS SOCKS ARE EVERYWHERE.
MM-HMM.
HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT?
OUR PRIMARY DIFFERENCE
IS THAT WE TESTED SOCKS
FROM EVERYTHING DOWN TO YOUR
CHEAP, MASS-MARKET MULTI-PACKS
ALL THE WAY UP TO
YOUR $18-TO-$22 NICHE
ATHLETIC RUNNING SOCKS,
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
WE FOUND OUT
THE MAJOR THINGS
THAT MADE THOSE SOCKS FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER
AND BROUGHT THEM DOWN
TO A $9 PRICE POINT,
AND ON THAT $9 PRICE POINT,
WE'RE STILL ABLE TO DONATE
A PAIR FOR EVERY PAIR PURCHASED.
I, TOO,
AM A FINE-TUNED ATHLETE.
I CAN OPEN UP TO THREE BOTTLES
OF WINE IN AN HOUR.
THAT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I LIKE TO DO IT
WITH SOCKS ON.
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION
PHILOSOPHICALLY ABOUT THIS IDEA
OF GIVING SOMETHING AWAY
EVERY TIME YOU SELL.
YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE
YOUR SALES
TO GIVE ME
THE EQUIVALENT RETURNS
THAT I GET FROM A COMPANY
THAT'S NOT DOING THE SAME THING.
WELL, WE DIDN'T HEAR YET --
WAIT A MINUTE.
NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO. YEAH.
OR YOUR SALES DOUBLE BECAUSE
OF THE GOODWILL THAT YOU'RE
PUTTING OUT THERE.
WHAT'S YOUR WHOLESALE?
WE SELL
EXCLUSIVELY ONLINE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES TO DATE,
AND WHEN DID YOU FIRST START?
SO, WE FIRST STARTED
IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR,
AND IN THE -- IN THE NINE MONTHS
SINCE WE LAUNCHED,
WE HAVE $450,000
IN SALES.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
WHAT WILL SALES BE
NEXT YEAR?
WE THINK THAT WE'LL CLOSE
THE END OF THIS YEAR
AT $1.1 MILLION.
WE THINK WE'LL CLOSE NEXT YEAR
AT $2.7 MILLION
AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT
AT $4.9 MILLION.
GREAT SALES FOR ONLINE.
AND AVERAGE MARGIN IS 54%.
THAT'S SHIPPED
TO THE CUSTOMER.
INCLUDING THE GIVEAWAY?
Both:
INCLUDING THE GIVEAWAY.
AND WHAT IS
YOUR MONTH-TO-MONTH GROWTH?
SO, OUR MONTH-TO-MONTH GROWTH
HAS PLATEAUED THIS YEAR,
BUT WE'VE
ALSO BEEN SPENDING
THE LAST TWO MONTHS
ON FUNDRAISING.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CIRCLE
$900,000 IN OUTSIDE FUNDING.
AT WHAT VALUE?
UH, $4 MILLION VALUATION.
GUYS, WHY ARE YOU WORTH
$4 MILLION?
WELL, IT'S WORTH WHAT PEOPLE
WILL PAY YOU FOR IT, BUT --
YOU CAN GET BOZOS,
OR YOU CAN GET ME.
YOU GET <i>BOTH</i> WITH HIM.
THE GODFATHER OF BOZOS
RIGHT HERE.
O'Leary:
GUYS, A $4 MILLION VALUATION
IN A TOTAL COMMODITY OF SOCKS
IS LUDICROUS,
AND I THINK REALITY
WILL STRIKE
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE
STILL SOCK COCKROACHES.
YOU'RE NOWHERE. YOU HAVE
NO MARKET SHARE YET. YOU
HAVE NO RETAIL EXPOSURE.
I-I THINK IF YOU CAN RAISE --
YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT
TO THE GUY WHO STARTED
UNDER ARMOUR, TOO.
IF YOU CAN RAISE MONEY
FROM ANY OF THESE --
ANY COMPANY.
ANY COMPANY.
EVERY -- YOU GOT TO
START SOMEWHERE.
IF ANY OF THESE SHARKS GIVE YOU
MONEY AT THAT VALUATION,
I WILL FORBID IT.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I'M OUT.
THANKS FOR
YOUR CONSIDERATION.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
SO, $400,000 IN SALES --
I -- IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE --
WILL IT WORK AS
A STANDALONE ONLINE BUSINESS
FOR THE LONG TERM...
MM-HMM.
...OR IS IT SUPPLEMENTARY?
YOU HAVEN'T CONVINCED ME
THAT THIS WILL WORK
AS A STANDALONE PRODUCT SALE.
LET ME ADDRESS THAT.
SO, IN THE $450,000
THAT WE'VE DONE TODAY,
WE HAVE SPENT $0 ON ADVERTISING
OR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION,
SO ALL OF THOSE SALES
HAVE COME
FROM PEOPLE TELLING OTHER PEOPLE
ABOUT OUR PRODUCT.
THAT'S THE CONCERN.
WORD OF MOUTH IS NOT
A SCALABLE STRATEGY.
RIGHT. SO, WORD OF MOUTH WAS
OUR PROOF OF CONCEPT, RIGHT?
THAT IS WHAT TOLD US --
OKAY, SO WHAT'S THE NEXT --
SO, THE NEXT STEP IS
WE'RE TAKING THIS MONEY
AND HIRING PEOPLE -- THE
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION SPECIALIST
WHO IS GONNA RAISE
OUR BASE DAILY SALES
FROM $500 TO $3,000 TO
$5,000 A DAY, TO BUILD
OUR BASELINE CUSHION.
YEAH, DAVID, DAVID --
HOLD ON.
PARTNERSHIPS WITH GLOBALLY
RECOGNIZED BRANDS.
DAVID,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD ANSWER FOR ME.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD ANSWER FOR ME.
I-I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB
OF TELLING ME
WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
AND WHAT THE KEY ADVANTAGE IS
GOING FORWARD.
I'M OUT.
GREAT SOCK, THOUGH.
THANK YOU.
O'Leary:
BEFORE ALL THE SHARKS ARE OUT,
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE
YOUR VALUATION METRICS?
WE'RE OPEN TO OFFERS
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO --
WELL, LET'S LET ANOTHER ONE
DROP OUT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Greiner:
WHEN I HEARD YOU JUST NOW SAY
THAT YOU WANTED TO USE THE MONEY
TO HIRE IN PEOPLE --
I HATE WHEN I HEAR THAT.
YOU'RE -- YOU ARE
TWO SMART GUYS,
AND I FEEL YOU SHOULD BE
DOING EVERYTHING
TO RUN EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN
RIGHT NOW, THE TWO OF YOU.
SO I REALLY DON'T LIKE
THAT STRATEGY.
I'M OUT.
Cuban: YOU'VE PLATEAUED.
AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE VIRAL,
I.E. WORD OF MOUTH, RIGHT?
NOW'S THE TIME,
NINE MONTHS IN,
YOU SHOULD NOT
BE PLATEAUING, RIGHT?
AND I GET NOW YOU WANT TO SPEND
MONEY BECAUSE YOU <i>HAVE</i> TO.
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS,
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WARBY PARKER,
WHEN YOU LOOK AT TOMS,
THEY'RE VERY HIGH MARGIN,
MUCH HIGHER-DOLLAR ITEMS.
A $9 SOCK,
WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE,
WITH A $5 MARGIN, THERE'S JUST
NOT ENOUGH MARGIN DOLLARS
IN EACH SALE
AND EACH CUSTOMER,
AND THAT'S ALWAYS
GONNA MAKE YOU
HAVE TO RUN
FASTER AND FURTHER.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
O'Leary: OKAY, NOW.
WE'RE DOWN TO ONE SHARK,
HAPPENS TO BE THE FASHION GURU.
YOU KNOW THAT SCENE
IN THOSE MOVIES IN THE E.R.
WHERE THEY'RE BRINGING
THE PATIENT, AND THE
HEART IS SLOWLY...
[ IMITATES MONITOR BEEPING ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS HYSTERICAL.
PADDLES.
[ IMITATES
ELECTRICITY BUZZING ]
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
SO, YOU HAVE A CHANCE NOW
TO READJUST YOUR VALUATION
BEFORE YOU HEAR
FROM THE LAST SHARK,
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD DO
THAT, OR ARE YOU GOING
TO GO DOWN WITH THE...
[ IMITATES ELECTRICITY BUZZING,
MONITOR BEEPING, FLATLINE ]
Narrator: FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
DAYMOND IS DAVID AND RANDY'S
LAST CHANCE TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR THEIR ATHLETIC-SOCK COMPANY,
BOMBAS.
YOU HAVE A CHANCE NOW
TO READJUST YOUR VALUATION
BEFORE YOU HEAR
FROM THE LAST SHARK,
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY.
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT?
John: YOU'VE HEARD FROM
FOUR OTHER WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE
IN BUSINESS.
THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T AGREE
WITH THAT VALUATION.
DO YOU HAVE
A DIFFERENT VALUATION
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER?
SO, WE --
WE CAME HERE TODAY,
OBVIOUSLY WITH
YOUR BACKGROUND,
WANTING TO STRIKE A DEAL
WITH YOU.
THANK YOU.
SO, BASED ON THAT,
WE WOULD --
WE WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING
TO GO DOWN TO --
I MEAN, HOW ABOUT
$200,000 AT 10%?
THAT GIVES YOU
A $2 MILLION VALUATION.
THAT CUTS
OUR VALUATION IN HALF,
BUT WE THINK YOU CAN BRING
A TON OF VALUE TO THIS.
$200,000 FOR 10%
IS YOUR COUNTER?
O'Leary: SO, YOU'VE
CUT THE VALUATION IN HALF,
DOWN FROM $4 MILLION
TO $2 MILLION.
SPECIFICALLY FOR DAYMOND.
WHAT, IT'S ONLY
A DAYMOND JOHN DEAL?
I MEAN, IT IS.
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS DO YOU HAVE?
EVERYBODY'S OUT.
Goldberg:
YOU GUYS ARE ALL OUT.
YOU'RE OUT ALREADY.
IT WOULD BE --
IT'D BE FOOLISH TO SAY
THAT HE DOESN'T BRING
VALUE TO -- YOU KNOW,
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF VALUE.
John: SO, LET ME -- SO, GUYS,
I WAS ABOUT TO BE OUT,
BUT I LIKE THAT VALUATION
ONLY BECAUSE
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DO
WANT TO GET TO WORK.
$200,000 FOR...
...20%.
VERY SOBERING
TO HEAR REALITY STRIKE.
VERY SOBERING.
AND I WAS OUT ALREADY.
SURE.
John: I HAD ALREADY --
WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE NEXT PERSON
WALKING THROUGH THAT DOOR...
SURE.
...AND THAT SMALL INDICATION
OF YOU WANTING TO MAKE
A BETTER DEAL WAS, UH --
WE'RE HERE
TO MAKE A DEAL.
OKAY.
I AM OFFERING YOU
$200,000 FOR 20%,
AND THEN
WE'LL JUST GET TO WORK.
SO, I THINK -- I THINK --
WE REALLY RESPECT YOUR OFFER.
I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE
WITH THAT --
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MIGHT
WANT MORE EQUITY --
IS THAT WE NEED
THE ADDITIONAL EQUITY
TO GO OUT
AND RAISE CAPITAL
WITHOUT GIVING AWAY
40% OF THE COMPANY IN TOTAL.
WHAT ARE YOU
RAISING THE CAPITAL FOR?
WE'RE RAISING THE CAPITAL
TO HIRE AND SPEND ON MARKETING
AND, YOU KNOW,
BUILD OUT OUR TEAM.
INVENTORY AND PRODUCT,
AS WELL.
INVENTORY AND PRODUCT,
I'LL FINANCE.
YOU'LL FINANCE THAT
OUTSIDE OF OUR DEAL?
I'LL FINANCE THE INVENTORY --
REGARDLESS OF
HOW MUCH IT IS?
REGARDLESS OF
HOW MUCH THAT IS,
BUT I -- I WOULD HAVE TO
QUESTION WHAT YOU'RE DOING
WITH THE MARKETING
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
'CAUSE THAT'S A BLACK HOLE
OF ADVERTISING.
SURE.
SO, UM, I WILL FINANCE
THE INVENTORY.
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
SO, OUR COUNTER
TO THAT WOULD BE
$200,000 AT 15%
WITH A $200,000 LINE OF CREDIT.
Herjavec:
THAT'S JUST SO CRAZY.
John: OKAY, GUYS, UM,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT --
I'LL TRY TO MEET YOU
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.
I'M GONNA FINANCE
THE INVENTORY.
$200,000 FOR 17.5% --
THAT'S IT.
NO LINE OF CREDIT?
NO. I'M -- I'M FINANCING
THE -- THE GOODS.
I'M ALREADY -- I'M ON THE HOOK
FOR THE GOODS RIGHT NOW.
CAN WE, UH -- CAN WE TAKE
A MOMENT AND CALL OUR C.F.O.?
UH, NO.
YOUR C.F.O. GAVE YOU
THE BAD ADVICE ALREADY
TO ASK FOR THAT VALUATION.
IT'S YOU GUYS, AND I DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE.
AS PARTNERS,
I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU GUYS,
AND YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO ME.
AH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
WE'LL TAKE THE DEAL.
MAZEL!
MAZEL!
[ LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
GREAT DECISION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GREAT DECISION, MAN.
GREAT DECISION.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
GOOD JOB.
Greiner: CONGRATULATIONS.
John:
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN THANK ME NOW.
THANK MR. WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU, MR. WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU. WE GOT A DEAL.
WE'LL THANK ALL OF YOU.
YEAH.
IT'S A SURREAL MOMENT.
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN
BUILDING THIS BRAND,
BUILDING THIS COMPANY,
AND NOW TO HAVE DAYMOND
AS A SHARK BACKING BOMBAS
MEANS THAT THE COMPANY
IS VALIDATED FOR US
IN A -- IN A NEW WAY.
