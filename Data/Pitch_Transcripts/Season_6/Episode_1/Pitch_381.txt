HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL ELLIOT.
I'M FROM LOS ANGELES,
CALIFORNIA,
AND MY BUSINESS IS
HAMMER &amp; NAILS.
I'M SEEKING $200,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
SHARKS, THERE ARE
MILLIONS OF GUYS LIKE ME
WHO GO TO NAIL SALONS
FOR MANICURES AND PEDICURES,
BUT WE DO SO RELUCTANTLY.
MM-HMM.
IT'S NOT THE SERVICE
THAT WE HATE SO MUCH,
IT'S THE ENVIRONMENT.
NAIL SALONS WEREN'T DESIGNED TO
APPEAL TO MEN'S SENSIBILITIES.
WOMEN ARE
THEIR DESIRED CUSTOMERS,
AND US GUYS KNOW THAT.
WE FEEL THAT
THE MOMENT WE WALK IN THE DOOR.
SO I CREATED HAMMER &amp; NAILS --
THE NAIL SHOP FOR GUYS.
IN MY SHOP,
GUYS FEEL RIGHT AT HOME
WITH LOW LIGHTING AND OVERSIZED
LEATHER CHAIRS JUST LIKE THIS,
WEARING HIGH-END HEADPHONES,
WATCHING PREMIUM PROGRAMMING
ON THEIR OWN PERSONAL
32-INCH FLAT-SCREEN TVs.
HAMMER &amp; NAILS
IS MAN-CAVE NIRVANA.
MY GOAL IS
TO GROW HAMMER &amp; NAILS
ACROSS THE U.S.
AND THE WORLD.
WITH AN INVESTMENT
FROM YOU SHARKS,
I CAN REACH MY GOAL,
AND TOGETHER,
WE CAN PUT THE "MAN"
IN "MANICURE."
ROBERT, I'D LOVE
TO HAVE YOU COME DOWN.
I WOULD LIKE
TO COME DOWN.
SIT IN THIS AMAZING CHAIR.
Cuban:
AW, I WANTED TO DO IT.
Herjavec: OH, PLEASE.
KICK HIM OUT.
OH, WOW.
Elliot:
SEE, THERE YOU GO.
THIS IS VERY COMFORTABLE,
MICHAEL.
THERE YOU GO.
Greiner: IT'S CLEVER.
THANK YOU.
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
WELL, I WAS IN DESPERATE NEED
OF A PEDICURE.
IT WAS LIKE A CRIME SCENE
DOWN THERE.
Cuban: [ LAUGHS ]
SO, I GO TO THIS NAIL SALON.
AND I'M SITTING THERE,
IT'S FILLED WITH WOMEN,
AND I JUST FELT
LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER.
AND THAT WAS
MY "AHA" MOMENT.
WHAT WAS SURPRISING TO ME
WAS HOW MANY OF MY WELL-GROOMED
GUY FRIENDS...
THAT IS SO GOOD.
...ADMITTED THAT THEY
HAVE NEVER HAD
A MANICURE OR PEDICURE BEFORE --
IT WAS SOMETHING UNMANLY.
O'Leary:
OKAY, GIVE US SOME NUMBERS.
YEAH, LET'S GO INTO
THE BUSINESS.
DO YOU HAVE
A LOCATION ALREADY?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
SO, I OPENED HAMMER &amp; NAILS
SEVEN MONTHS AGO.
SO FAR,
WE'VE GENERATED $150,000.
WE'LL DO ANOTHER $100,000
IN THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS.
SO, WE'LL DO $250,000
OUR FIRST YEAR.
THAT WAS GREAT.
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, NATASHA.
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE
FOR A, UH, MANICURE/PEDICURE?
PRICES RANGE FROM $23
UP TO AS HIGH AS $125.
John:
DO YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE,
SUCH AS TAILORING
OR ANYTHING ELSE THERE?
WAXING?
NO.
WE ONLY DO MANICURES
AND PEDICURES, SOME MASSAGES...
OKAY.
...AND THIS IS WHY --
I THINK BY CREATING SERVICES
LIKE FACIALS, WAXING,
THINGS LIKE THAT,
SUDDENLY HAMMER &amp; NAILS
BECOMES A SALON.
I WANT HAMMER &amp; NAILS TO BE
WHAT IT IS.
I WANT TO PROTECT THE BRAND
AND STAY IN OUR LANE
AND BE THE BEST AT IT,
BECAUSE 3,000 GUYS
HAVE WALKED THROUGH MY DOOR --
MILLIONAIRES TO THE GUYS
THAT WORK AT THE CABLE COMPANY.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
WELL, I -- LOOK,
WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD,
I WAS A KID IN THE SYSTEM.
I WAS A WARD
OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.
I SPENT MY JUNIOR YEAR
OF HIGH SCHOOL
LIVING IN A YOUTH SHELTER.
BY 18, I WAS
LITERALLY ON THE STREETS.
I SPENT TWO YEARS LIVING
ON THE STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA,
AND BY 20, I DECIDED
THAT I WANTED
TO MAKE SOMETHING OF MYSELF.
SO, I SAVED UP MY MONEY,
AND I DECIDED TO PUBLISH
THE VERY FIRST HIP-HOP MAGAZINE
ON MARCH 15, 1988.
I WENT FROM HOMELESS TO BE--
WHAT WAS IT CALLED?
IT WAS CALLED <i>KRUSH</i> --
K-R-U-S-H.
THE VERY NEXT YEAR,
I TOOK $250,
I CREATED A LOCAL
HIP-HOP MUSIC-VIDEO SHOW
CALLED "KRUSH RAP,"
AND I SELF-SYNDICATED IT
TO 20 MARKETS.
I BECAME THE DIRECTOR
OF SPECIAL PROJECTS
WHICH WAS, AT THAT POINT,
THE <i>ROLLING STONE</i> OF HIP-HOP.
I-I KNOW YOU.
I MEAN, YOU'RE A LEGEND.
I MEAN...
THANK YOU.
KEEP GOING. THE STORY'S GOOD,
SO -- YOU'RE ENTERTAINING.
YEAH, THE STORY'S GREAT.
WELL, I WAS SORT OF
BURNED OUT ON HIP-HOP
AND DECIDED TO MOVE
TO CALIFORNIA.
I DECIDED I WAS GONNA
WRITE MOVIES, OF ALL THINGS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, LITERALLY,
I WENT TO A BOOKSTORE,
I BOUGHT A BOOK
ON SCREENWRITING --
Herjavec:
DID YOU WRITE A SCREENPLAY?
OH, BOY, DID I.
13 MONTHS LATER,
I SOLD MY VERY FIRST SCRIPT
TO 20th CENTURY FOX.
FOUR YEARS LATER,
IT WAS THE MOVIE "BROWN SUGAR."
MOST RECENTLY,
I HAD A FILM IN THEATERS
CALLED "JUST WRIGHT."
IT STARRED QUEEN LATIFAH.
MY FILMS TO DATE
HAVE GENERATED $118 MILLION
AT THE BOX OFFICE.
YOU KNOW,
YOUR STORY IS FASCINATING.
FASCINATING.
THANK YOU.
MY PLAN IS TWO THINGS --
I WANT TO FRANCHISE
THIS BUSINESS.
I BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE
THE STARBUCKS OF MEN'S
NAIL SHOPS ALL OVER THE WORLD.
I BELIEVE THAT, AND, TWO --
I MEAN, YOU CAN SAY, "I BELIEVE,
I BELIEVE" ALL YOU WANT...
NO, BUT LISTEN, KEVIN,
IT'S NOT ABOUT --
...BUT THE ONLY THING
THAT SPEAKS THE TRUTH
TO A FRANCHISEE
IS CASH <i>FLOW.</i>
NO, LISTEN.
AND I UNDE--
KEVIN, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT HERE'S WHAT I KNOW --
BECAUSE I --
I LIKE IT WHEN I SAY THAT.
YES, YOU DO.
I'M NOT TRYING TO --
IN OTHER WORDS,
SOMEBODY COME HERE
AND SAYS, "HOW MUCH MONEY AM I
GONNA MAKE IN THE FIRST YEAR,"
AND YOU SAY,
"YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE."
IT COMES DOWN
TO PROOF OF CONCEPT.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, MICHAEL,
LET THE NUMBERS TALK.
LET THE NUMBERS TALK.
SURE.
$250,000 FORECAST
FOR THIS YEAR --
HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE?
WELL, I WILL SAY THIS --
UH-OH.
I -- NO, I'LL -- I DIDN'T GO
INTO THIS PARTICULAR BUSINESS
BELIEVING THAT IN MY FIRST YEAR,
I'LL BE PROFITABLE.
SO, YOU'RE
GONNA BREAK EVEN?
I WILL BREAK EVEN.
IN FACT, LAST MONTH,
WE DID 25% MORE IN REVENUE,
AND WE DID BREAK EVEN.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
JUST KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF?
WHY WOULD I NOT
FRANCHISE THE BUSINESS?
YEAH.
THERE'S MUCH MORE MONEY TO BE
MADE FRANCHISING THIS BUSINESS.
NO.
WE'LL DISAGREE ON THAT
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOT IT,
AND YOU'RE
AHEAD OF THE CURVE,
GET TO THE POINT
WHERE IT IS SO PROFITABLE,
THE FRANCHISEES
WILL PAY WHATEVER
AS OPPOSED TO YOUR HAVING
TO CONVINCE THE FRANCHISEES.
YOU'RE PUTTING THE CART
BEFORE THE HORSE,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
SO, I THINK THAT THE
HAMMER &amp; NAILS IS REALLY CLEVER,
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
IF GUYS WOULD GO TO THAT OR NOT.
I DON'T THINK
THAT I COULD EVEN JUDGE
WHETHER OR NOT THIS BUSINESS
WOULD MAKE ME MY MONEY BACK,
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
THANK YOU.
I -- I MEAN,
I REALLY DO.
I MEAN, I'M -- I'M SITTING HERE,
I'M THINKING,
"WHY AREN'T THERE MORE OF THESE
SALONS OUT THERE FOR GUYS?"
BUT I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE
YOUR ANSWER TO MARK
BECAUSE
THE ONLY GOOD ANSWER
TO THE QUESTION
THAT MARK ASKED YOU,
WHICH IS "WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO IT ON YOUR OWN?"
IS, "I DON'T HAVE
THE CAPITAL.
"I PUT EVERY PENNY TOGETHER
TO OPEN UP ONE STORE,
"AND I'M PROVING A CONCEPT,
AND THAT'S WHY
I HAVE TO FRANCHISE"...
RIGHT.
..."IF I WANT TO GROW."
I APPRECIATE THE MANICURE,
BUT I'M OUT.
OKAY.
O'Leary: SO, MICHAEL, YOU'RE
ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS
FROM EVEN GETTING ANYBODY
TO SIGN FOR A FRANCHISE LICENSE.
AT SOME POINT, YOU
HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT THE
STABILIZED NUMBERS ARE
FOR A TWO-
TO THREE-YEAR PERIOD.
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TRY
AND SELL THE VISION --
AND YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT --
IN THE END,
AS WE KNOW IN THE SHARK TANK,
THE NUMBERS RULE.
THEY ALWAYS
DICTATE THE TRUTH.
YOUR BUSINESS
DOESN'T MAKE MONEY,
AND I DO NOT BELIEVE.
SO, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANKS FOR CONSIDERING.
SO, I APPLAUD YOU
FOR WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO
IN REGARDS TO
BRINGING BACK STYLE
AND TEACHING MEN
SOME MANNERS.
I USED TO BE A MEMBER
OF A PLACE IN NEW YORK
CALLED JOHN ALLAN --
A VERY SIMILAR PLACE.
YEAH.
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.
MY CHALLENGE IS THIS --
I BELIEVE
IF YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER,
YOU HAVE TO
UPSELL THE CUSTOMER,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SELLING
AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS.
YOU GO TO SOMEPLACE
LIKE A JOHN ALLAN,
THEY HAVE FINE SUITS,
THEY HAVE A-A BAR.
ALSO, THAT WOULD BE
HARDER TO DUPLICATE
FOR A FRANCHISE OWNER
IF THEY TRY TO KNOCK YOU OFF.
I DON'T SEE
ALL OF THAT HERE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
LISTENING AND CONSIDERING.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.
Herjavec: YEAH, GOOD LUCK.
YEAH, CONGRATS
ON YOUR SUCCESSES.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
John: AND THANK YOU --
THANK YOU FOR
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR HIP-HOP.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Herjavec: I THINK
YOU BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO BE
KNOCKED OFF AS A FRANCHISE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WAS SURPRISED
KEVIN DIDN'T BRING IT UP.
OH, YEAH.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST CHAIRS
WITH SOME PEOPLE DOING NAILS.
O'Leary: I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA BREAK EVEN EVER.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK --
IT'S GOING TO ZERO.
Elliot: I LOOK FORWARD TO
THE TIME WHEN ALL OF THE SHARKS,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
KICK THEMSELVES AND GO,
"OH, MY GOD. HE DID IT."
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
SO...WATCH.
Narrator:
NEXT UP ARE RECENT COLLEGE GRADS
WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE
A BETTER WAY TO STAY RECHARGED.
