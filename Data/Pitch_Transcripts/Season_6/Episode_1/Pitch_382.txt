SHARKS,
MY NAME IS BILL SHUEY.
I AM THE CO-FOUNDER
AND C.E.O. OF AMBER.
AND MY NAME'S KYLE BYRD.
I'M HEAD OF PRODUCTS
AND A CO-FOUNDER AT AMBER.
SHARKS, TODAY WE ARE
RAISING $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% STAKE
WITHIN AMBER.
SHARKS, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU BEEN AT AN AIRPORT
AND HAD YOUR PHONE
TRAGICALLY DIE IN YOUR ARMS?
YOU KNOW OUR PAIN
ALL TOO WELL.
THE FACT IS
WE DIDN'T WANT TO WALK AROUND
WITH CHARGERS
IN OUR POCKETS
OR GIVE OUR PHONES
TO BARTENDERS
TO CHARGE OUR PHONES
IN A PUBLIC SPACE.
WE SAW A PROBLEM,
AND WE CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION.
SHARKS, AMBER IS
A MOBILE-PHONE CHARGING STATION
THAT IS COMPLETELY FREE
TO USE.
WE SECURE YOUR DEVICE
IN ONE OF OUR SEVEN COMPARTMENTS
USING BIOMETRIC SCANNING,
NAMELY FINGERPRINT SCANNING.
WE MADE IT
SUPER, SUPER SIMPLE.
LET'S SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.
SIMPLY WALK UP,
SCAN THEIR FINGERPRINT...
...CHOOSE ONE OF
THE AVAILABLE COMPARTMENTS...
AND WHENEVER THEY'RE DONE,
THEY SIMPLY
RE-SCAN THEIR FINGER
AND ONE OF THE DOORS
WILL UNLOCK.
WE REALIZE THAT AMBER
WASN'T JUST A FREE, SECURE WAY
FOR PEOPLE TO CHARGE
THEIR PHONES IN A PUBLIC SPACE
BUT COULD ALSO DRIVE REVENUE
FOR VENUES
BY KEEPING PEOPLE
AROUND LONGER
AND HEIGHTENING
THE OVERALL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.
WE WANT TO PUT AMBER
IN BARS, RESTAURANTS, GYMS,
MOVIE THEATERS, ARENAS --
REALLY ANYWHERE.
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.
SHARKS, BY SECURING
AN INVESTMENT TODAY,
WE CAN MAKE OUR FIRST BIG PUSH
INTO SEEING AMBER
IN VENUES
ACROSS THE NATION.
NOW, WHO WANTS
TO SECURE A DEAL WITH AMBER?
SO, IS THE PRODUCT
SHIPPING?
SO, WE ARE PRE-REVENUE.
I LOVE THAT WORD,
"PRE-REVENUE."
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE JUST GRADUATED
A FEW WEEKS AGO FROM COLLEGE.
WHERE'D YOU GO TO SCHOOL?
JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY
IN VIRGINIA.
Herjavec: BILL,
WALK ME THROUGH THE PREMISE.
YOU WALK INTO A BAR.
SURE.
I'M A BAR OWNER.
YOU'RE A BAR OWNER.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA
CHARGE ME?
SO, WE WILL EITHER
CHARGE YOU $2,000 OUTRIGHT
FOR THE UNIT,
OR YOU CAN LEASE IT
EITHER ON A SIX-, NINE-MONTH --
AND SO I BUY IT FOR $2,000,
THAT'S IT.
SURE.
THERE'S NO MORE REVENUE
FOR YOU.
OR -- OR YOU CAN GET IT
RIGHT ON YOUR WALL
FOR $150 RIGHT THERE, AND
IT'S -- IT'S A MONTHLY $150.
IT'S A CONVENIENCE
FOR THE BAR,
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THEY HAVE TO HAVE, SO --
WELL, SO -- SO ACTUALLY,
RIGHT NOW,
PEOPLE ARE CHARGING THEIR PHONES
IN BARS, RIGHT?
THEY'RE GIVING THEM
TO BARTENDERS,
TO WAITRESSES AND WAITERS.
THAT'S A LIABILITY.
IT'S LIKE, "HEY,
CAN I GET MY PHONE?"
WELL, THAT WAITER OR WAITRESS
MAY HAVE LEFT,
GOTTEN OFF WORK,
AND NOW THEY HAVE A LOST PHONE.
John:
GUYS, YOU SAID A DOOR LOCKS.
I DIDN'T SEE A DOOR LOCK.
SO, THE LOCKS IN HERE
IS WHAT WE'RE USING FOR TESTING.
WE'RE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY,
UM, SOURCING OUR LOCKS
THROUGH MASTER LOCK.
OKAY, SO THERE WILL BE
A DOOR ON THERE?
YEAH, YEAH.
YES.
BILL, HAVE YOU TESTED
THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER?
WE HAVE. WE TEST IT ALL
ON THE BACK END.
'CAUSE I'M IN
THE CYBER-SECURITY SPACE.
RIGHT.
AND HERE'S WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT FINGERPRINT SCANNERS --
THEY CAN BE VERY FINICKY...
VERY.
...EXCEPT FOR
THE VERY, VERY HIGH-END ONES.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOU,
THE IDEA OF YOU WALKING UP ONCE,
PUTTING YOUR FINGER IN THERE,
AND IT RECOGNIZING YOU,
AND THE DOOR COMING DOWN
IS LUDICROUS.
WE HAVE
A BIG SECURITY CENTER.
THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER
THAT WE PAY
FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO
THAT CENTER
WAS WELL, WELL OVER $50,000.
Y-- THERE'S NO WAY,
FOR THAT PRICE POINT,
YOU'RE GONNA BUY
A FINGERPRINT SCANNER
THAT'S GONNA WORK
THAT QUICKLY.
RIGHT, SO...SO --
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK --
SOMEONE'S GONNA COME UP,
THEY'RE GONNA GO ONCE,
THEY'RE GONNA GO TWICE,
THEY'RE GONNA GO
THREE TIMES.
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA PULL IT
OFF THE WALL. [ CHUCKLES ]
YEAH, AND I WAS GONNA SAY --
SO THE -- SO THE --
AND -- AND THIS IS BEFORE
THEY'VE HAD SOMETHING TO DRINK.
TELL US HOW MUCH YOU'VE
INVESTED, RIGHT,
BECAUSE YOU'VE
GOT TO BUILD PROTOTYPES.
SO, ON OUR COLLEGE BUDGETS,
UH, UH, WE ARE SITTING,
UM...
[ CLICKS TONGUE ]
I THINK
WE'RE RIGHT AROUND $11,000.
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE A UNIT?
RIGHT NOW WE CAN MAKE THE UNIT
FOR $1,000 WITH --
OH!
O'Leary: $1,000?
THIS IS GOING TO END
SO BADLY!
THAT IS
SUCH A BAD BUSINESS.
WHAT ARE YOU --
YOU'RE SAYING --
OH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE SAYING THE COST OF IT
TO BUY IS $2,000, RIGHT?
THEY SAID $2,000.
OH, IT'S, UH -- IT'S $150
A MONTH OR $2,000 OUTRIGHT.
WHY WOULD A BAR
PAY YOU $2,000
WHEN YOU GO TO THE AIRPORT,
THOSE GUYS WHO HAVE
THE BIG CHARGERS,
THEY ISSUE IT FOR FREE
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO
THEIR ADVERTISING?
RIGHT.
WHY WOULDN'T A BAR PUT ONE
OF THOSE FREE DEVICES
BEHIND THE BAR?
Greiner: I MEAN, WHY DOES
ANYBODY REALLY NEED THIS?
I THINK THERE'S SO MANY
PERSONAL CHARGING DEVICES,
AND ACTUALLY,
I'M IN THE SPACE RIGHT NOW.
SURE.
WE'RE CREATING SOMETHING THAT IS
LIGHT-YEARS AHEAD OF THIS.
I'M OUT.
Cuban:
THE COST IS HORRIBLE, GUYS.
I MEAN, YOU'VE
GOT TO GET THIS DOWN
UNDER $100 TO EVEN BE --
AND THAT'S -- AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.
UM, IT'S JUST
THE FACT OF THE CAPITAL...
BUT YOU'RE
SO FAR AWAY, RIGHT?
...TO GET TO THAT POINT.
AND I FEEL BAD
'CAUSE YOU'VE PUT IN A LOT
OF BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS.
WAIT, WAIT. NO SWEAT AND TEARS,
JUST BLOOD IN THE WATER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BLOOD.
WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD A LOT
OF INTEREST FROM FESTIVALS,
UM, AND, SAY, LARGER-SCALE
VENUES -- CONVENTIONS.
SO, WE ACTUALLY -- WE --
WE DEVELOPED A PRODUCT,
LIKE, PUTTING IT ON A STAND,
UM, AND HAVING, SAY, 14 UNITS.
Cuban: LOOK, WHENEVER YOU HAVE
A LOT OF PEOPLE,
ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
IS CREATE A REASON FOR THEM
TO CONGREGATE IN ONE SPOT
WAITING FOR SOMETHING.
ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS CREATING MORE LINES.
AND THEN, THE FINGER SCANNER --
SOMEONE'S WET, SOMEONE'S GRIMY.
YOU'RE AT A FESTIVAL -- IT'S NOT
GONNA BE A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT.
THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary: THERE'S ONLY ONE ANSWER
TO THIS --
I HAVE TO HIRE YOU BOTH
SO I CAN FIRE YOU.
THIS IS SO HORRIBLE.
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS HAS ANY
CHANCE OF SURVIVING AND WORKING?
I HATE THIS SO MUCH,
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS
I'VE EVER SEEN. I'M OUT.
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST
IN THIS BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
Shuey: SO, WE DO HAVE
COMPETITION.
THERE ARE A FEW
COMPANIES OUT NOW --
Cuban: YEAH, THERE'S
A LOT OF COMPETITORS.
RIGHT.
Herjavec:
YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITOR IS FREE.
YOU'VE COME OUT
WITH AN INCREDIBLY
ELEGANT SOLUTION TO FREE.
LOOK, I'M OUT.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
I THINK THAT WAS
THE SHORTEST PITCH.
IT'S THE WORST PITCH,
THAT'S WHY.
IT'S HORRIBLE.
I THOUGHT YOU PUT
YOUR GLASS THERE AND FILL IT UP.
HEY, HE LEFT HIS PHONE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
Shuey: THE COST WAS AN ISSUE,
THE SECURITY WAS AN ISSUE.
I KNOW IT WORKS.
WE'VE TESTED IT A MILLION TIMES.
I MEAN, I WOULD PROBABLY
GO RAIL HERJAVEC IN THE TEETH.
I MEAN, IT -- THAT'S NOT...
WOW. [ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S RUDE.
DUDE, SHE WANTED ME TO BE
HONEST, I'M BEING HONEST.
[ CHUCKLES ] OH, COME ON.
UM...

NEXT UP ARE ENTREPRENEURS
WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVE
IS A BETTER VERSION
OF A COMMON WARDROBE STAPLE.
