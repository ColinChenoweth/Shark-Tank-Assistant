HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS SHARON YU.
TODAY, I'M SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% OF EQUITY IN MY COMPANY,
MAGIC COOK, THE FIRST
OUTDOOR, ON-THE-GO COOKER
FOR ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.
NOW, WITH THIS LITTLE CONTAINER,
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO COOK
A HOT, DELICIOUS SALMON MEAL
I'D LIKE TO -- YES?
SHARON,
WHO NEEDS THIS?
I NEED IT.
YOU NEED IT.
WHY DO I NEED IT?
YOU EAT LUNCH.
WHY DON'T I JUST GO GET
A HOT MEAL AT A RESTAURANT?
CAMPING, RIGHT?
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,
THEY PREPARE FOR OUTDOORS.
SO, THIS IS FOR THE OUTDOORSMAN
THAT HAS NO OTHER OPTION?
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.
Cuban: NO, I COULD SEE YOU
TAKING IT TO THE OFFICE.
Yu: DAYMOND?
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
DAYMOND IS SHARON'S LAST CHANCE
AT MAKING A DEAL
FOR HER SELF-HEATING
FOOD CONTAINER, MAGIC COOK.
DAYMOND?
WHY DO YOU FEEL
YOU NEED A PARTNER?
I'VE BEEN IN THIS INDUSTRY
FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS,
Yu: DAYMOND WAS
THE SHARK I WANTED,
BECAUSE WE HAVE
SO MUCH IN COMMON --
SAME BACKGROUND.
HE HAS KNOWLEDGE
FOR MANUFACTURING,
SO WE HAVE THE SAME LANGUAGE.
SO I'M SO THRILLED
TO WORK WITH HIM.
Narrator: LAST SEASON,
