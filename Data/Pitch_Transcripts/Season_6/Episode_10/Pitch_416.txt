AND BASED
ON OUR CUSTOMER FEEDBACK,
WE KNOW IT WORKS.
ONLY ONE QUESTION
REMAINS --
WHICH OF YOU SHARKS
WILL LOCK UP A DEAL WITH...
KITCHEN SAFE!
KITCHEN SAFE!
[ LAUGHS ] YAY.
ARE YOU LIKE THIS
AT HOME?
John: ALL RIGHT.
WOW.
NOT REALLY.
NOT USUALLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO,
DO WE GET TO SEE ONE?
ABSOLUTELY.
YES. DAVE WILL HAND OUT
SOME SAMPLES.
LORI.
Greiner:
AH, THANK YOU.
KEVIN, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED, BUT GREEN.
YES.
I LIKE THAT A LOT.
DAYMOND.
THANK YOU.
OUR WHITE COLOR,
WHICH IS ACTUALLY
OUR TOP SELLER.
AND, MARK --
NO SURPRISE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
NO SURPRISE.
APPRECIATE IT.
Greiner: SO, YOU TURN IT TO
WHATEVER TIME YOU WANT IT TO BE.
YES.
[ WHIRRING ]
OH, THERE IT WENT.
MINE'S LOCKED.
[ CHUCKLES ]
[ LAUGHS ] OKAY.
AND THE ONLY WAY TO UNLOCK IT
IS FOR THE TIMER TO GO DOWN?
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE ARE NO OVERRIDES.
NO OVERRIDES?
NO OVERRIDES?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
YEAH.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE KIDS?
I DO.
I HAVE A 3-YEAR-OLD.
OKAY,
SO YOUR 3-YEAR-OLD --
YOU PUT IN
HIS FAVORITE CANDY,
AND YOU SET THIS
TO THREE HOURS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA HEAR
FOR THREE HOURS
FROM THAT 3-YEAR-OLD?
ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS IS,
WHEN I WAS A KID,
MY PARENTS USED TO CALL
AND SAY "TIME OUT.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE AWAY YOUR TOY
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY."
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS
YOU NAG THEM, YOU NAG,
AND EVENTUALLY,
THEY WOULD GIVE IN.
BUT WITH THIS,
THEY PUT IT IN THERE,
AND YOU LOCK IT,
YOU SET IT FOR SIX HOURS,
AND YOU SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
"SORRY. I CAN'T
GET INTO IT, EITHER."
Woodman: YEAH.
"YOU SHOULD HAVE LEARNED.
THAT'S IT."
EXACTLY -- YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK
AS A DAD,
'CAUSE YOU'RE JUST SAYING,
"LOOK, I CAN'T OPEN IT."
BUT WHO CARES
WHAT THE SHARKS THINK?
WHAT DOES THE MARKET SAY?
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY OF THESE?
WE'VE SOLD $300,000
SINCE WE'VE LAUNCHED.
WE'VE ONLY BEEN SHIPPING
FOR 11 MONTHS.
ONLINE OR IN RETAIL?
ABOUT 90% OF OUR SALES
ARE ONLINE
THROUGH
OUR DIRECT CHANNEL.
HAVE YOU EVER TALKED TO
A RETAILER ABOUT STOCKING THIS?
WE <i>JUST</i> STARTED
APPROACHING RETAILERS.
AND WHAT DID THEY SAY?
Greiner: WHO?
UH, WE HAVE A P.O.
WITH HSN.
I'M TALKING
ABOUT SHELF SPACE.
WE HAVE NOT STARTED
REACHING OUT TO RETAILERS
WITH A LOT OF SHELF SPACE
AT THIS TIME.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU TO MAKE,
AND WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
CURRENTLY,
IT COSTS US $14.50 TO MAKE.
HMM.
WE SELL FOR $49 RETAIL.
OH!
REALLY?
$49?!
$49?! HOLY CRAP.
$49 IS A GOOD INVESTMENT
FOR A PRODUCT
THAT HELPS YOU LIVE
A BETTER, HEALTHIER LIFE.
BUT WHEN THIS FINALLY
OPENS UP,
DO YOU JUST EAT EVERYTHING,
LIKE A JUNKYARD DOG?
LIKE <i>I</i> WOULD? YEAH.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE DEAL WITH THE CUSTOMER
E-MAILS ALL THE TIME,
AND WHEN SOMEONE'S LIKE,
"THANK YOU.
"I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS
FOR 10 YEARS.
I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING
THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE,"
THAT KEEPS ME GOING.
WHAT I REALLY AM TOUCHED BY,
I HAVE TO SAY, SITTING HERE,
IS <i>YOUR</i> EMOTION
TO HIM GETTING UPSET.
I MEAN, IT SHOWS
YOU REALLY LOVE THE GUY.
STRONG TEAM.
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000
AT A 20% EQUITY STAKE MYSELF.
I HAVE ONE CONTINGENCY.
YOU GUYS ARE
ABOUT TO GO ON HSN.
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO BE ON QVC INSTEAD.
I MEAN,
I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO ON QVC,
AND I CAN MOVE
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
BUT I -- BUT I ALREADY HAVE
A DEAL WITH HSN,
SO WE CAN KEEP THAT RELATIONSHIP
AND MAKE IT EVEN STRONGER.
OKAY.
SO, I'LL -- I'LL COME IN
WITH ANOTHER 100K
IF SHE'LL PARTNER
WITH ME...
YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?
...BECAUSE
I LOVE THE POTENTIAL.
I THINK YOU NEED
SOME MARKETING HELP.
SO, ARE YOU ASKING
FOR 40% TOTAL?
DO YOU WANT TO DO IT,
INSTEAD, AT 30%?
50% AND 50%?
200K, 30%.
AND CONTINGENCY --
YOU CANNOT DO HSN.
AND THEN, MY --
BUT YOU CAN DO QVC.
YEAH, AND THEN,
MY DEAL IS...
LIGHTS, CAMERAS,
CUSTOMERS.
...$100,000, 20%,
AND I'M ALREADY WITH HSN,
SO I WOULD WORK WITH YOU THERE.
BUT I ALSO HAVE
DIRECT CONNECTION
AND MY OWN SECTION NOW
AT BED BATH &amp; BEYOND LAUNCHING.
I'M GLAD I INTRODUCED YOU
TO THEM, YES...
THIS IS A PERFECT
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND --
'CAUSE THAT WAS MY DEAL.
HE DID NOT.
ANYWAY, SO --
WE -- WE MADE AN AGREEMENT
TO DO HSN.
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THAT --
WHICH IS FINE,
AND YOU CAN DO IT --
IT'S OUR OBLIGATION
TO DO THAT
BECAUSE WE SAID
WE WERE GONNA DO THAT.
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.
YES, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.
YOU COULD GO ON
AND FULFILL THAT PURCHASE ORDER.
Cuban: AND IF THEY
ASK YOU BACK AGAIN --
IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL
AND THEY ASK YOU BACK AGAIN?
IF WE'RE WORKING WITH LORI,
THEN I-I --
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU LEFT.
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND?
YES, THEY DO.
SO YOU THINK
A COMPETITOR WOULD SAY,
"OH, PLEASE,
GO TO MY COMPETITOR...
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
...BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND."
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU HAVE
A FINANCIAL PARTNER...
YEAH.
...THAT IS
SOMEWHERE ELSE
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO
TO THAT OTHER PLACE.
OKAY.
SO, YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
UNLESS MARK'S DECIDING
TO DO SOMETHING WHICH
WE HAVEN'T HEARD.
INTO BOTTOM
OF THIS PLASTIC CONTAINER.
ADD WATER.
NOW TRANSFER
THE STAINLESS-STEEL CONTAINER
INTO PLASTIC CONTAINERS.
NOW LOCK THE LID ON TIGHT.
IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS, THE WATER
WILL START TO RAPIDLY BOIL.
WOW.
WHAT?!
AFTER 24 MINUTES LATER,
IT'LL BE ALL DONE.
I HAVE A MEAL HERE
THAT I PREVIOUSLY STARTED
JUST LIKE
THOSE FANCY COOKING SHOWS HERE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
A PERFECTLY COOKED
SALMON STEAMED MEAL.
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.
WANT A HOT DRINK OR SOUP
WITH YOUR MEAL?
NO PROBLEM.
OUR MAGIC COOK BOTTLE
CAN DO THE SAME MAGIC FOR YOU.
YOU CAN HEAT UP ANY SOUPS
OR ANY BEVERAGES.
NOW, SHARKS,
WE JUST LAUNCHED.
I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE
MAGIC COOK A HOT COMMODITY.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S
REALLY INTERESTING.
[ LAUGHS ]
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY
WHO THINKS THE WORLD
IS GONNA END TOMORROW.
YES. YES.
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THIS.
FINDING THAT PERSON IS
THE BIG CHALLENGE.
I'M NOT EVER GONNA BE
THAT PERSON HANGING OFF A ROCK,
UNLESS SOMEBODY
CARRIES ME UP THERE.
WELL --
I DON'T DO CAMPING.
CAMPING SUCKS.
I'M OUT.
FOR ME,
MY SHARKONOMICS 101 --
IS IT SOMETHING
PEOPLE NEED AND WANT?
IS IT GONNA FILL
A BROAD AUDIENCE?
IS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MADE
AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE?
I'M SORRY.
CAN I ASK YOU THIS --
CAN YOU JUST USE THIS
AS A REGULAR WATER BOTTLE?
I FEEL THERE'S TONS
OF COMPETITION
OUT THERE FOR THIS --
TONS.
MM-HMM.
AND I THINK
IT NEVER MAKES SENSE
TO GO OUT
AGAINST SOMETHING
WHERE THAT SOLUTION'S
ALREADY BEEN MADE
BY A MILLION DIFFERENT
MANUFACTURERS SUCCESSFULLY.
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT
INVESTMENT FOR ME,
SO I'M OUT.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
THANK YOU.
THAT LEAVES ONE SHARK --
DAYMOND.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
DAYMOND?
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S TOM SANETTI.
I'M FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH,
CALIFORNIA.
MY PRODUCT IS
EARTH-LOG FIRE PRODUCTS.
I'M HERE SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $160,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20%
OF MY FAST-GROWING BUSINESS.
EARTH-LOG FIRE LOGS ARE
A MANUFACTURED FIRE LOG,
AND WE'RE JUST LIKE
ALL THE OTHER GUYS,
BUT WE'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
EARTH-LOGS ARE MADE
USING 100% RECYCLED RESOURCES.
THEY BURN UP TO THREE TIMES
HOTTER THAN WOOD,
PRODUCE UP TO 80% LESS SMOKE,
AND THE LITTLE SMOKE YOU GET
SMELLS GREAT.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE PRODUCTS
ON THE MARKET.
WE HAVE OUR ORIGINAL
EARTH-LOG FIRE LOG,
WE HAVE A CITRONELLA FIRE LOG,
AND WE HAVE
OUR INSTANT BONFIRE BLOCK.
OUR MOTTO AT EARTH-LOG
IS SIMPLE --
MORE HEAT, LESS SMOKE,
GREAT SCENT.
WE BELIEVE OUR FIRE PRODUCTS
ARE THE BEST FIRE PRODUCTS
AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET.
SO, COME ON, SHARKS.
WHO WANTS TO <i>MAKE</i> SOME GREEN
WHILE WE <i>BURN</i> GREEN?
O'Leary:
TOM, I'M YOUR CUSTOMER.
I BUY ABOUT 10 CASES OF THESE
EVERY YEAR FROM COSTCO.
I'M NOT BRAND-LOYAL.
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.
SO HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE
TO ME
THAT THE EARTH-LOG
IS DIFFERENT
THAN THE OTHER LOG
THAT I'M BUYING ALL THE TIME?
OURS IS THE ONLY FIRE LOG
THAT DOESN'T SMELL TERRIBLE,
BECAUSE
WE USE ONLY REFINED --
BUT HOW
DO YOU TELL ME THAT?
HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE THAT
TO ME WHEN I'M WALKING
DOWN THE AISLE OF COSTCO
BUYING 10 CASES?
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I NEED HELP WITH THE MARKETING.
AH. BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T --
AMONGST OTHER THINGS.
HERE I AM.
BUT -- BUT
THESE ARE KEY QUESTIONS.
I'M YOUR NUMBER-ONE CUSTOMER
ON EARTH,
AND I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF YOU.
WE HAVE
VERY LIMITED DISTRIBUTION.
TOM, CAN WE SEE
YOUR PRODUCT?
PLEASE.
LET ME GRAB THESE FOR YOU.
Greiner: AND THIS IS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE INSIDE.
AND HERE'S
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE INSIDE.
OKAY.
SMELLS GOOD.
WHAT DOES ONE OF THESE
COST THE CUSTOMER?
A CASE OF SIX,
THEY RUN AROUND $20 TO $22.
WHAT DOES
THE COMPETITION COST?
A CASE OF SIX.
AND WHAT IS ONE?
WE ACTUALLY GO FOR $1 LESS THAN
WHAT THEY'RE SELLING THEM FOR.
IS THERE ANOTHER
"EARTH-FRIENDLY" LOG OUT THERE?
THERE ARE,
BUT NONE OF THEM ARE SCENTED.
BUT I'M NOT COMPETING
WITH THEM.
I HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT,
AND THEY KNOW IT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE BUSINESS.
WE'VE HAD
ABOUT 200,000 IN SALES.
O'Leary: DOLLARS?
IN WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
SINCE WHEN?
IT'S A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD,
BUT WHAT YOU
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS --
$200,000 IN FOUR YEARS?
WHAT YOU
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS
I DIDN'T START THIS
AS A BUSINESS.
IT HAPPENED ORGANICALLY
AND ACCIDENTALLY.
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE LAST YEAR IN SALES?
WE ONLY DID $50,000 LAST YEAR,
BUT LET ME --
I KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT ANSWER.
I <i>HATE</i> THE ANSWER.
WE DID $100,000
THE YEAR BEFORE.
LAST YEAR, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
HAD ITS HOTTEST WINTER
IN 100 YEARS.
THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT SELLING
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA.
ABSOLUTELY. WE ARE NOT.
THE NORTHEAST HAD ITS COLDEST
WINTER SINCE YOU WERE BORN.
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE DISTRIBUTION
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE MANUFACTURING.
I WENT FROM MAKING THESE
IN MY KITCHEN
FOR MYSELF
AND MY FRIENDS --
MY FRIENDS SAID, "YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL MARKET
AND TRY TO SELL IT."
I TOOK IT
JUST TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD MARKET.
HE SOLD OUT IN ABOUT A WEEK.
SO I SAID, "WOW. I'M GONNA GO
TO THE OTHER MARKET."
EVERYBODY WAS
SELLING THEM OUT.
SO I SAID, "I THINK
I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE."
I STARTED MAKING
MORE AND MORE OF THEM.
WE WOULD PUT THEM
IN A BARREL,
PUT IT IN THE FORM,
AND PRESS THEM BY HAND.
THIS IS A COMMODITY BUSINESS,
OKAY?
YES.
THERE'S FOUR OR FIVE RETAILERS
THAT HAVE 80% OF THE MARKET.
I'LL NAME TWO --
COSTCO, HOME DEPOT.
OKAY.
SO, WHEN YOU CALLED THOSE BUYERS
WITH YOUR CLAIMS
THAT YOU WERE BETTER,
WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I HEARD MARK CUBAN SAY,
"NOBODY DOESN'T RETURN
<i>MY</i> CALL."
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,
<i>NOBODY</i> RETURNS MY CALLS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'VE SUBMITTED
TO HOME DEPOT --
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?
NO, I WANT TO TELL YOU --
I'VE BEEN TO
ALL MY LOCAL HOME DEPOTS,
AND THE MANAGERS SAY,
"WE LOVE IT,
"BUT YOU HAVE TO GO TO ATLANTA
TO SUBMIT,
OR YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE."
YOU ALSO MENTIONED COSTCO.
COSTCO WANTS US
TO GO INTO THEIR STORES.
OKAY.
THEY OFFERED US
A FOUR-STORE DEAL.
I'M HOLDING OFF ON THAT
RIGHT NOW.
WHY?
HOW CAN YOU SELL SOMETHING
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE?
WHAT, AM I GONNA GO TO COSTCO
AND TELL THEM
"SURE, HERE'S OUR GREAT PRODUCT"
AND THEN THEY WANT TO ORDER IT,
AND I SAY, "SORRY.
I CAN'T FILL YOUR ORDER"?
IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY
AND ATTRACT AN INVESTOR HERE,
THERE HAS TO BE
A DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY, OKAY?
WHY DON'T YOU PICK
<i>ONE</i> NATIONAL RETAILER?
I HAVE
A LETTER OF INTENT.
ALL RIGHT, FROM WHO?
WE JUST CLOSED A DEAL
FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST GROCERS
IN THE COUNTRY, ALBERTSONS.
GROCERS? OKAY.
WOW.
TEST OR NATIONAL ROLLOUT?
WELL, THEY WANTED US
TO GO NATIONAL,
AND I TOLD THEM, BECAUSE OF
OUR LIMITED DISTRIBUTION STILL,
WE WANT TO DO
THE 180 CALIFORNIA STORES
UNTIL WE CAN
INCREASE PRODUCTION.
WOULD THEY HAVE TAKEN YOU
TO MORE THAN 180
IF YOU COULD HAVE
SUPPLIED THEM?
YES, THEY ACTUALLY WANTED US
TO GO INTO 3,200 STORES.
Greiner: REALLY?
HEY! GOOD FOR YOU.
LAST YEAR, ANOTHER
NATIONAL RETAIL GROCERY STORE,
VONS PAVILIONS,
ASKED US TO GO IN, AS WELL.
THEY SAID THEIR MINIMUM ORDER
WOULD BE 22 TRAILERS.
I SAID, "THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD DO THAT IN 22 YEARS."
WHAT'S YOUR SOLUTION
FOR THAT?
AUTOMATION.
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I'M LOOKING FOR THE FUNDING
TO BUILD THE MACHINES
TO GET US
TO FULL AUTOMATION.
DO THOSE MACHINES
CURRENTLY EXIST?
THEY DON'T.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PROPRIETARY PROCESS
THAT WE'VE JUST RECENTLY
FILED FOR PATENTS FOR.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THIS AND DURAFLAME...
WELL, FIRST, LET ME --
LET ME ADDRESS --
...OTHER THAN THE SCENTS?
ALL THE OTHER FIRE LOGS ARE MADE
FROM SAWDUST AND SLACK WAX.
SLACK WAX IS A VERY HEAVILY
OIL-LADEN, SMELLY WAX.
I LOVE IT.
I WILL BE A CUSTOMER
BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT,
BUT IT'S NOT YET
A COMPANY.
I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO SAY,
"IS IT WORTH MY TIME
AND MY TEAM'S TIME
TO TAKE THIS FROM GROUND ZERO
TO WHERE YOU THINK IT COULD GO?"
IF YOU WERE FURTHER ALONG,
YEAH, RIGHT?
BUT YOU'RE NOT TO THE POINT
WHERE YOU JUST NEED PHONE CALLS.
YOU NEED <i>EVERYTHING,</i>
AND EVERYTHING IS A LOT OF WORK,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I AGREE WITH MARK.
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK
TO BUILD THE ORGANIZATION
AROUND YOU.
THIS IS OUT OF
THE GoPro PLAYBOOK --
WE ALWAYS KNEW WE HAD
A REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITY,
BUT WE RECOGNIZED
WE WERE, LIKE, EIGHT PEOPLE,
AND WE NEEDED TO START
WITH SMALL RETAILERS,
BUILD A BRAND,
BUILD AN ORGANIZATION, YOU KNOW,
AND WHEN BEST BUY CALLED,
WE WERE READY FOR IT.
AND I THINK
YOU'RE TRYING TO GO
FROM ZERO TO 1,000 MILES AN HOUR
RIGHT AWAY.
I THINK YOU'LL SUCCEED,
BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TO DO,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
TOM, LISTEN, UM,
I THINK YOU HAVE
A REALLY AMAZING PRODUCT,
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE
A LOT OF STEPS TO GO.
I THINK YOU WILL MAKE IT,
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE IT OUT.
IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY
FOR ME.
SO WITH THAT, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN THE BASEMENT
BACK IN THE LATE '80s
STARING THE LEARNING COMPANY,
AND AFTER I'D GO GET
A $12 MILLION ORDER
FOR READER RABBIT,
IT WOULD BLOW UP BEHIND ME --
THE LOGISTICS.
I COULDN'T DELIVER.
AND I MET A GUY
NAMED MIKE PERIK.
I GAVE HIM HALF MY EQUITY
TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM.
WE SOLD THE COMPANY
FOR $4.2 BILLION 5 YEARS LATER.
BEST INVESTMENT
I EVER MADE.
YOU HAVE TO FIND
YOUR MIKE PERIK.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I DON'T WANT A JOB.
I JUST WANT
TO INVEST MY MONEY
SO I CAN SIT ON THE DOCK
WITH MY TOES IN THE WATER.
LOOK, I HAVE
A CERTAIN SENSE OF FRUSTRATION,
BUT I SEE ME IN YOU.
GO FIND YOUR MICHAEL PERIK.
DO IT.
YOU'LL MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY.
GOOD LUCK. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
IT'S YOU AND I.
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.
YES.
YOU KNOW, YOU MAKE ME THINK OF
A PRODUCT CALLED ScreenMend,
WHICH PATCHED YOUR SCREENS.
LOVE IT.
THEY WERE MAKING IT
OUT OF THE GARAGE.
I LOVED THE PRODUCT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT.
SO I TOOK A GAMBLE
ON THEM.
TO DATE, WE'VE DONE
$1 MILLION IN SALES IN A YEAR.
I LOVE YOUR PRODUCT.
I LIKE THE NAME --
EARTH-LOG.
I THINK
IT'S SUPER-APPEALING.
I LOVE
THAT THEY SMELL GOOD.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS,
I LIKE.
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A BLOODSUCKING ONE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
STILL AN OFFER.
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
A REALISTIC OFFER
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE
TO TAKE YOU
FROM WHERE YOU ARE
TO ACTUALLY BEING ABLE
TO MANUFACTURE THIS,
GET THIS OUT
INTO RETAILERS EVERYWHERE.
SO I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
$160,000,
BUT I'D LIKE 35%.
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
ALL THE PLACES ScreenMend IS --
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,
HOME DEPOT, LOWE'S --
I THINK THAT I CAN GET YOU
INTO ALL OF THESE PLACES, TOO.
DEAL.
DEAL!
[ LAUGHS ]
YAY!
THAT WAS EASY.
[ LAUGHS ]
LORI, THAT WAS NOT
A BLOODSUCKING OFFER.
AWESOME! YAY!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
BLOW THIS THING UP.
I LOVE IT.
HEY, TOM, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE NEGOTIATION?
I DIDN'T NEED IT.
I THINK IT WAS A FAIR DEAL.
CONGRATULATIONS, TOM.
YOU WERE GREAT,
AND I'M VERY, VERY HAPPY
THAT LORI DID THAT.
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
GOOD. NOW I'LL GO OUT
AND BUY SOME FOR YOU.
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
I APPRECIATE IT.
CONGRATS, TOM.
I'M FEELING ALL WARM AND FUZZY.
I LOVE IT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
Sanetti:
CHICKS DIG EARTH-LOG,
SO I KNEW LORI WOULD BE
THE PERFECT PARTNER.
DREAMS COME TRUE IN AMERICA
THANKS TO THE SHARK TANK.
