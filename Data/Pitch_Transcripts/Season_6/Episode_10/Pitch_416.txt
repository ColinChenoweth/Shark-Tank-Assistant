WE DEAL WITH THE CUSTOMER
E-MAILS ALL THE TIME,
INTO BOTTOM
OF THIS PLASTIC CONTAINER.
ADD WATER.
NOW TRANSFER
THE STAINLESS-STEEL CONTAINER
INTO PLASTIC CONTAINERS.
NOW LOCK THE LID ON TIGHT.
IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS, THE WATER
WILL START TO RAPIDLY BOIL.
WOW.
WHAT?!
AFTER 24 MINUTES LATER,
IT'LL BE ALL DONE.
I HAVE A MEAL HERE
THAT I PREVIOUSLY STARTED
JUST LIKE
THOSE FANCY COOKING SHOWS HERE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
A PERFECTLY COOKED
SALMON STEAMED MEAL.
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.
WANT A HOT DRINK OR SOUP
WITH YOUR MEAL?
NO PROBLEM.
OUR MAGIC COOK BOTTLE
CAN DO THE SAME MAGIC FOR YOU.
YOU CAN HEAT UP ANY SOUPS
OR ANY BEVERAGES.
NOW, SHARKS,
WE JUST LAUNCHED.
I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE
MAGIC COOK A HOT COMMODITY.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S
REALLY INTERESTING.
[ LAUGHS ]
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY
WHO THINKS THE WORLD
IS GONNA END TOMORROW.
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S TOM SANETTI.
I'M FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH,
CALIFORNIA.
MY PRODUCT IS
EARTH-LOG FIRE PRODUCTS.
I'M HERE SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $160,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20%
OF MY FAST-GROWING BUSINESS.
EARTH-LOG FIRE LOGS ARE
A MANUFACTURED FIRE LOG,
O'Leary:
TOM, I'M YOUR CUSTOMER.
I BUY ABOUT 10 CASES OF THESE
EVERY YEAR FROM COSTCO.
I'M YOUR NUMBER-ONE CUSTOMER
ON EARTH,
TOM, CAN WE SEE
YOUR PRODUCT?
PLEASE.
LET ME GRAB THESE FOR YOU.
WHAT DOES ONE OF THESE
COST THE CUSTOMER?
A CASE OF SIX,
THEY RUN AROUND $20 TO $22.
TO GET US
TO FULL AUTOMATION.
DO THOSE MACHINES
CURRENTLY EXIST?
THEY DON'T.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PROPRIETARY PROCESS
THAT WE'VE JUST RECENTLY
FILED FOR PATENTS FOR.
I WILL BE A CUSTOMER
BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT,
BUT IT'S NOT YET
A COMPANY.
I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO SAY,
TOM, LISTEN, UM,
I THINK YOU HAVE
A REALLY AMAZING PRODUCT,
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE
A LOT OF STEPS TO GO.
I THINK YOU WILL MAKE IT,
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE IT OUT.
IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY
FOR ME.
SO WITH THAT, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS IN THE BASEMENT
BACK IN THE LATE '80s
STARING THE LEARNING COMPANY,
HEY, TOM, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE NEGOTIATION?
I DIDN'T NEED IT.
I THINK IT WAS A FAIR DEAL.
CONGRATULATIONS, TOM.
YOU WERE GREAT,
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
I APPRECIATE IT.
CONGRATS, TOM.
Sanetti:
CHICKS DIG EARTH-LOG,
SO I KNEW LORI WOULD BE
THE PERFECT PARTNER.
DREAMS COME TRUE IN AMERICA
THANKS TO THE SHARK TANK.
