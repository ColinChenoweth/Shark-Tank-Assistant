HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS SHARON YU.
TODAY, I'M SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% OF EQUITY IN MY COMPANY,
MAGIC COOK, THE FIRST
OUTDOOR, ON-THE-GO COOKER
FOR ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.
NOW, WITH THIS LITTLE CONTAINER,
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO COOK
A HOT, DELICIOUS SALMON MEAL
WITH NO POWERS, NO BATTERY,
NO GAS, AND NO FIRE.
FIRST, ADD FRESH SALMON
AND SOME VEGGIE.
NOW ADD OUR MAGIC HEAT PACKS
I'D LIKE TO -- YES?
SHARON,
WHO NEEDS THIS?
I NEED IT.
YOU NEED IT.
WHY DO I NEED IT?
YOU EAT LUNCH.
WHY DON'T I JUST GO GET
A HOT MEAL AT A RESTAURANT?
CAMPING, RIGHT?
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,
THEY PREPARE FOR OUTDOORS.
SO, THIS IS FOR THE OUTDOORSMAN
THAT HAS NO OTHER OPTION?
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.
Cuban: NO, I COULD SEE YOU
TAKING IT TO THE OFFICE.
SOME PEOPLE WORK AND WORK HARD,
AND SO WE EAT AT OUR DESKS,
AND WE PREFER TO EAT
SOMETHING THAT WE LIKE.
BUT THERE'S NO MICROWAVE
IN YOUR OFFICE.
YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT,
RIGHT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
WELL, I CAN SEE THIS
WORKING REALLY WELL AT MY DESK.
REALLY?
THIS IS OUR LUNCH BOXES.
AND --
THANK YOU.
YOU CAN TAKE ONE.
MR. WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.
Greiner: WHAT IS INSIDE OF IT
THAT'S MAKING THAT BOIL?
UM, THE HEAT PACK
CONSISTS OF QUICKLIME,
SO IT HAS CALCIUM, SODIUM.
WE HAVE A TEST REPORT
TO SUPPORT THAT IT'S NONTOXIC.
IT'S SAFE TO USE.
SO, I CAN SEE IT AS SORT OF
PART OF AN EMERGENCY KIT,
BUT IF I EVER FOUND MYSELF
IN A PLACE
WHERE I HAD TO USE THIS
TO EAT DINNER,
I KNOW I'VE TAKEN
A WRONG TURN SOMEWHERE.
[ CUBAN LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
EXPLAIN THE ECONOMICS.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE EACH ONE?
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING THEM NOW?
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
SURE. THE LUNCH BOXES
ARE $6.50 TO MAKE.
AND WE HAVE ONE PACKS --
INCLUDING ONE HEAT PACK --
AND WE SELL IT FOR $29.99.
FOR THE CUPS,
IT'S $4.75 TO MAKE
AND ALSO
WITH ONE LITTLE HEAT POUCH,
AND WE SELL IT FOR $19.99.
AND WHERE ARE YOU
SELLING THEM NOW?
DICK'S SPORTING GOODS,
SPORTS CHALET, UM, CABELA'S.
SO TOWARDS
THE OUTDOORSMEN MARKET
IS WHERE
YOU'RE SELLING THEM NOW.
OUTDOOR MARKETS, YES.
HOW MUCH ARE THE PACKS?
FOR THIS FIVE PACKS,
THE COST TO MAKE IS $2.
AND WHAT
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
AND WE SELL IT FOR $9.99.
AND WHERE
ARE YOU MAKING THIS?
CHINA.
HOW HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE BEEN
MAKING IN CHINA?
WELL, MY BACKGROUND
IS PROMOTIONAL PRODUCT INDUSTRY,
SO I'VE BEEN
IN THE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS
FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS,
SO TO DEAL WITH CHINESE PEOPLE,
IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE FOR ME.
WHAT HAVE YOUR SALES BEEN
TO DATE?
WE JUST LAUNCHED IT
FOR ABOUT A YEAR.
LAST YEAR, WE HAVE
ABOUT $150,000 IN REVENUE.
OOH.
SO, HOW MANY HEAT PACKS
ARE YOU SELLING?
'CAUSE THAT'LL KIND OF
GIVE US AN IDEA
OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
USING IT AND REUSING IT.
YES, THE HEAT PACKS --
WE SOLD 35,000.
WOW!
YEAH,
FOR THE LARGE ONES --
SO ONCE YOU BUY IT, YOU HAVE TO
KEEP BUYING THE REFILLS.
THAT'S CORRECT.
O'Leary: I MEAN,
IT'S A NICHE PRODUCT.
9 OUT OF 10 PEOPLE
DON'T NEED THIS.
WELL, DO YOU EAT LUNCH?
YEAH, BUT I DON'T NEED <i>THIS</i>
FOR LUNCH.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW, WHEN
A NATURAL DISASTER STRIKES,
IF YOU HAVE A WATER BOTTLE,
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?
YOU CAN JUST DRINK, RIGHT?
THAT'S IT.
CAN YOU COOK WITH IT?
NO.
THIS IS JUST AN OPTION.
YOU CAN GO OUT THERE AND FISH,
GET A FRESH FISH,
AND COOK IT, RIGHT?
[ GROANS ]
SO, IT'S THE SAME PRICE --
$19.99.
THAT'S TOUGH.
YOU KNOW WHAT? LOOK...
NO, IT'S HARD
WITH THAT ONE.
...IS THERE A UTILITY
FOR THIS? YES.
YES.
PERSONALLY, I THINK GOING FOR
THE CAMPING MARKET IS ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS NOT
AN INTUITIVE PRODUCT
TO BUY WITHOUT SEEING
THE DEMONSTRATION, RIGHT?
YEAH.
MM-HMM.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS
A TOUGH DEAL.
SOMEBODY HAS TO DO A LOT OF WORK
TO...PREPARE FOR THIS.
THE HAVE TO PLAN AHEAD.
PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA TAKE --
IT SEEMS LIKE A SURVIVAL,
SORT OF DISASTER --
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE
AN IMPULSE BUY.
"OH, YEAH. WAIT --
OH, GEEZ.
I CAN COOK MY OWN SALMON
AT WORK," RIGHT?
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
THAT TRIGGERS THAT, RIGHT?
WELL --
I JUST DON'T SEE IT,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
SO -- SO,
A REALLY IMPORTANT THING
WHEN YOU COME UP
WITH A CONCEPT
IS THAT YOU SOLVE
A PERVASIVE PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE
AND YOU DON'T TRY TO CREATE
A NEW WAY TO DO SOMETHING
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY
BROKEN.
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
OH.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
O'Leary: LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THE MARKET FOR THIS.
Yu: DAYMOND?
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
DAYMOND IS SHARON'S LAST CHANCE
AT MAKING A DEAL
FOR HER SELF-HEATING
FOOD CONTAINER, MAGIC COOK.
DAYMOND?
WHY DO YOU FEEL
YOU NEED A PARTNER?
I'VE BEEN IN THIS INDUSTRY
FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS,
AND I HAVE NO PARTNERS.
I NEED SOMEBODY
TO CHALLENGE ME,
AND I THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT.
YOU CREATE
A BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT.
YOU KNOW THIS.
YOU KNOW SOURCING.
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ELSE
LIKE THAT,
SO I'M GONNA TAKE A FLIER
WITH YOU,
BECAUSE I THINK THAT,
IF THIS WORKS OR DOESN'T,
THERE'S STUFF
FOR US TO DO TOGETHER.
YOU ASKED
FOR $100,000 FOR 20%.
20%. YES.
$100,000 FOR 33%,
WE HAVE A DEAL.
$100,000 FOR 33%.
ARE YOU GONNA
THINK ABOUT THAT?
COULD I MAKE A PHONE CALL
TO MY LAWYER?
NO.
YOU CANNOT MAKE A PHONE CALL
TO YOUR LAWYER.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOUR HUSBAND, YOUR SPOUSE,
YOUR MOM, YOUR DAD,
BUT NOT
A BLOODSUCKING LAWYER.
I WANT TO DEAL
WITH THE DECISION-MAKER...
OKAY.
...BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO
MAKE DECISIONS TOGETHER,
AND I DON'T NEED
A LAWYER AROUND,
BECAUSE THEN I HAVE 19 LAWYERS
THAT YOU COULD TALK TO.
IT'S A BIG DECISION.
LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE,
BECAUSE IT TOOK ME A YEAR
TO GET HERE.
IT TOOK ME <i>45</i> YEARS
TO GET HERE, SO...
$100,000 --
GIVE ME A HUG.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
SHE DID IT.
OH! SORRY!
GIVE ME A HUG.
YOU DID IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S LESS THAN A MINUTE.
I LIKE THAT.
YES.
ALL RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[ LAUGHS ]
John: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
Cuban: GOOD JOB, D.J.
CONGRATS.
Yu: DAYMOND WAS
THE SHARK I WANTED,
BECAUSE WE HAVE
SO MUCH IN COMMON --
SAME BACKGROUND.
HE HAS KNOWLEDGE
FOR MANUFACTURING,
SO WE HAVE THE SAME LANGUAGE.
SO I'M SO THRILLED
TO WORK WITH HIM.
Narrator: LAST SEASON,
EVAN MENDOLSON AND NICK MORTON
MADE A DEAL WITH ROBERT HERJAVEC
FOR THEIR
UGLY-CHRISTMAS-SWEATER COMPANY
TIPSY ELVES.
ROBERT,
WE ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.
EXCELLENT, GUYS.
O'Leary: OH!
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
Morton:
BEFORE BEING ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD $800,000 IN SALES.
AFTER "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD $3 MILLION IN SALES.
Mendelson:
AND THIS YEAR, WE'RE PROJECTING
$8 MILLION IN SALES.
TWO, THREE...
TODAY, WE'RE HAVING
A MASSIVE PHOTO SHOOT
FOR THE UPCOMING
HOLIDAY SEASON.
THE INVESTMENT
FROM ROBERT
HAS ALLOWED US
TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT LINE.
THE FIRST THING IS
OUR U.S.A. JUMPSUIT,
WHICH IS PRETTY EPIC.
Mendelson: BEFORE, WE WERE JUST
SELLING HOLIDAY SWEATERS.
NOW WE'RE SELLING
ST. PATRICK'S DAY SHIRTS,
VALENTINE'S SHIRTS,
4th OF JULY APPAREL,
AND LOTS OF
OTHER FUN PRODUCTS.
Morton:
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT BY
DIVERSIFYING OUR PRODUCT LINE,
WE CAN MAKE TIPSY ELVES
A $50-MILLION-A-YEAR COMPANY.
Man: JUMP.
[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]
HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS?
Morton: NOT ONLY HAVE
OUR SALES BEEN GROWING,
BUT OUR TIPSY ELVES TEAM
IS, TOO.
WE'VE HIRED TWO NEW DEVELOPERS,
AN OPERATIONS TEAM,
AND A TEAM OF
INTERNET-MARKETING CONSULTANTS.
HEY, ROBERT.
HERJAVEC: Hey, guys.
Mendelson: IT'S AMAZING
THAT SOMEONE AS BUSY AS ROBERT
HAS MADE HIMSELF SO AVAILABLE
TO TIPSY ELVES.
WE'RE GONNA BE DONATING
SOME MONEY TO TOYS FOR TOTS.
It's great to make money,
and it's better to give it back.
THANKS TO "SHARK TANK" AND
THE RAPID GROWTH OF TIPSY ELVES,
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
TO BE MAKING A LARGE DONATION
TO TOYS FOR TOTS
THIS YEAR.
GOING ON "SHARK TANK"
WAS ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS
OF OUR LIVES.
IT'S COMPLETELY ACCELERATED
OUR BUSINESS,
AND IF WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY,
WE WOULD 100% DO IT AGAIN.
All: HAPPY HOLIDAYS
FROM TIPSY ELVES!
[ ALL CHEER ]
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS
A BETTER WAY
TO WARM UP BY THE FIREPLACE.
