HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M RYAN TSENG.
AND I'M DAVID KRIPPENDORF!
YES, YOU ARE.
WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF THE KITCHEN SAFE
BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO,
CALIFORNIA.
WE ARE SEEKING $100,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 5%
EQUITY STAKE IN OUR COMPANY!
SHARKS, AMERICA'S FIGHTING
A BATTLE WE MUST WIN!
THE ENEMY IS
JUNK-FOOD TEMPTATION,
AND IT IS EVERYWHERE!
[ CHUCKLES ]
AT WORK --
BOWLS OF CANDY.
AT HOME --
CHIPS, CHOCOLATE, CAKE,
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON GIRL SCOUT COOKIES!
[ LAUGHS ]
IT'S NO WONDER
THAT 2/3 OF US ARE OVERWEIGHT!
THERE HAS TO BE
A BETTER WAY!
INTRODUCING
THE KITCHEN SAFE.
THE KITCHEN SAFE
IS A REVOLUTIONARY
NEW TIME-LOCKING CONTAINER
THAT HELPS YOU FIGHT TEMPTATION.
IT'S FUN, EFFECTIVE,
AND EASY TO USE.
PICTURE THIS,
SHARKS --
LET'S SAY THAT DAVID IS
A SERIAL MIDNIGHT MUNCHER,
BUT BEFORE
THOSE CRAVINGS SET IN,
ALL DAVID HAS TO DO
IS PLACE THOSE TEMPTATIONS
IN THE KITCHEN SAFE.
NEXT, HE ROTATES THE DIAL
TO SET THE TIMER.
AND FINALLY, HE PRESSES THE DIAL
TO ACTIVATE THE LOCK.
ONCE THE KITCHEN SAFE
IS LOCKED,
IT CANNOT BE OPENED
UNTIL THE TIMER REACHES ZERO.
THE KITCHEN SAFE IS GREAT
FOR SO MANY THINGS --
TV REMOTES, VIDEO GAMES,
CREDIT CARDS, AND CELLPHONES --
YOU NAME IT.
CAN'T STOP SNACKING
BEFORE DINNER?
KITCHEN SAFE!
ARE YOUR KIDS
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
INSTEAD OF DOING
THEIR HOMEWORK?
KITCHEN SAFE!
THIS GUY'S FANTASTIC.
LOOKING TO BREAK
A BAD HABIT?
KITCHEN SAFE!!
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE KITCHEN SAFE
IS GREAT
FOR JUST ABOUT
ANY UNWANTED TEMPTATION.
IT'S WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL
A COMMITMENT DEVICE,
AND IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN
TO FIGHT TEMPTATION.
Krippendorf:
I MEAN -- LET ME FINISH.
FINALLY!
YOU KNOW, MY GOAL IS NOT TO
BECOME AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL,
BUT WHAT I DO THINK I CAN DO
IS I CAN HAVE THAT MODERATION.
I CAN SET IT
FOR, LIKE, 7:00 P.M.,
AND THEN I WON'T HAVE
ANY COOKIES UNTIL THEN.
AND, YES,
YOU CAN BREAK IT,
BUT IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE THING
TO BREAK TO HAVE A COOKIE.
BUT HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH
THE SKEPTICISM I HAVE
THAT THIS PRODUCT
IS REALLY JUST A TCHOTCHKE?
THERE'S NO REAL MERIT.
THEY IGNORE YOU.
THAT'S HOW THEY DEAL WITH IT.
NO, IT DOES SOMETHING.
IT ACTUALLY IS ADDRESSING
A CONSUMER PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
AMERICA'S GONNA SPEND $49 --
NO,
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.
THE COST OF MAKING THIS
IS WAY TOO HIGH.
Greiner: IF YOU CAN
BREAK IT DOWN FROM $14.50,
HOW MUCH LOWER DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN GET?
WE THINK WE CAN GET IT DOWN
TO $10, $12, OR EVEN LOWER.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY TYPE OF I.P. --
PATENTS --
THAT PROTECT THIS CONCEPT?
YEAH, WE HAVE, UH,
FOUR PATENTS PENDING.
ONE OF THEM IS
A DESIGN PATENT.
YOU KNOW, WE DO BELIEVE
THIS WILL END UP IN RETAIL.
WE HAVE TALKED
TO MANUFACTURERS' REPS
WHO HAVE BEEN VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THE PRODUCT,
AND THEY ARE STARTING
TO TALK TO, YOU KNOW,
RETAILERS OUT THERE --
THE BIG BOXES.
BUT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'D
LIKE YOUR HELP WITH, AS WELL.
THIS SEEMS LIKE,
AT A $29.99 PRICE, YOU'D HAVE --
John: THE LOWEST
THEY CAN GET THIS, THOUGH,
IT LOOKS LIKE, IS $10,
WHICH MEANS, AT RETAIL,
IT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $40.
Woodman:
YEAH, EXACTLY.
YOU'D HAVE TO MORTGAGE
YOUR HOUSE TO HIDE YOUR COOKIES.
KITCHEN SAFE IS MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT LIMITED
AS A COMPANY NAME,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO GROW INTO NEW PRODUCTS
AND PERHAPS NEW VERTICALS
WHERE THIS IS NOT EVEN
IN THE KITCHEN.
I MEAN,
I WAS REALLY LUCKY.
ORIGINALLY,
I JUST MEANT FOR GoPro
TO BE
A SURF-CAMERA COMPANY,
AND THANKFULLY, I DIDN'T
NAME THE COMPANY "SURF CAMERA."
SO I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO NATURALLY THINK
TO PUT ANYTHING
OTHER THAN FOOD IN THIS.
Greiner:
HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT...
MM-HMM.
BUT THE BEAUTY OF IT IS
THAT YOU COULD TAKE --
AND JUST WITH PACKAGING
DO DIFFERENT PACKAGING
FOR DIFFERENT THINGS.
YEAH.
I REALLY WANT TO GET
TO THE VALUATION NOW.
PLEASE DON'T GO THERE.
NO. IT'S NOT WORTH $2 MILLION,
YOU DON'T THINK?
THE MARKET VALUE
FOR OUR COMPANY
IS HIGHER THAN WE'RE OFFERING
THE SHARKS.
ALL RIGHT, WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT MARKET VALUE HERE.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE,
RIGHT?
WELL, <i>I</i> DO.
John: YOU DO?
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU GOT TO LEAVE, THEN,
'CAUSE YOU COULD GET THE MONEY.
WELL, WE DON'T
JUST WANT THE MONEY.
WE WANT THE EXPERTISE.
LET ME HELP
CLEAR THE AIR HERE, OKAY?
THIS PRODUCT ISN'T
GOING TO ACTUALLY WORK
UNLESS
IT'S VERY INEXPENSIVE.
Woodman: YES.
TO ME, SOME ELEMENT OF IT
IS TCHOTCHKE.
WHY DO YOU KEEP
SAYING THAT?
TCHOTCHKE IS JUST STUFF
THAT SITS THERE.
LET ME FINISH, ALL RIGHT?
THIS DOES SOMETHING.
LET ME FINISH.
RIGHT.
PEOPLE USE IT.
IT WORKS.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
I'M LISTENING, AND IT SAYS,
"I'M A PIECE OF CRAP."
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO E-MAIL US EVERY DAY
AND CALL US AND TELL US
HOW IT'S MADE
A HUGE IMPACT IN THEIR LIFE.
THIS DUDE'S PASSIONATE.
YOU'RE STRIKING A NERVE.
AND SO MAYBE TO YOU,
IT'S A $15 PIECE OF CRAP...
HE'S PASSIONATE,
AND I DIG IT.
YOU GOT EMOTIONAL.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
O'Leary:
LET ME FINISH, OKAY?
SO, WHEN I LOOK AT IT AND SAY,
"HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?" --
WHICH IS
ALL I CARE ABOUT --
I'LL SELL A PIECE OF CRAP
IF I CAN PROFIT FROM IT.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM AT ALL
DOING THAT.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CAPITALISM
IS, ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT FOR ME.
YOU MAY FALL INTO
THE "PIECE OF CRAP" CATEGORY.
KEVIN! IF YOU SAY
"PIECE OF CRAP" ONE MORE TIME --
YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT
THIS GUY AS AN INVESTOR.
LET ME FINISH!
SILENCE! PLEASE!
LET ME FINISH.
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN MAKING
A PIECE OF CRAP, KEVIN.
NO, LOOK, I SAID,
"CAN I MAKE MONEY?"
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST STOP.
JUST STOP TALKING.
AND SO, I --
JUST LET ME FINISH.
YOU KNOW WHY HE NEEDS
TO STOP TALKING?
LET ME FINISH!
NO. I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
LET HIM FINISH.
YOU DO NOT WANT HIM
AS AN INVESTOR.
LORI, I BEG YOU.
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
LET HIM FINISH,
ARE YOU GONNA
ASK HIM AGAIN
BECAUSE I'M SICK OF HEARING HIM
SAY IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP.
HOW YOU CAN LOWER
THE COST OF THE GOODS?
AND I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
OH! EXCELLENT.
THANK YOU, KEVIN.
LET ME HELP.
I'M OUT.
THANK GOD.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Krippendorf: I WANT SOMEONE
WHO BELIEVES IN THIS
AND THE FACT
THAT THIS HELPS PEOPLE OUT.
I MEAN,
IT'S GREAT TO MAKE MONEY,
BUT THIS MATTERS TO ME
A LOT.
I DON'T NEED THIS MONEY.
I CAN SURVIVE.
I CAN PAY MY BILLS WITHOUT THIS.
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT MATTERS TO ME PERSONALLY.
AND SO YOU MAY THINK
IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP...
I DO.
BUT I DON'T CARE.
I UNDERSTAND.
SO DON'T GO BUY IT
AND DON'T --
DON'T OFFER US MONEY.
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD,
MY FRIEND,
'CAUSE SOME PERCENTAGE
OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE,
INCLUDING INVESTORS,
THINK IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP.
THAT'S FINE.
I'M ONE OF THEM, OKAY?
I'M INTERESTED
IN THE PEOPLE THAT --
DEAL WITH IT.
GET OVER IT.
DON'T START CRYING. BE A MAN!
Narrator: KEVIN IS OUT,
AND HE'S CONFRONTED
DAVID AND RYAN
ON THE MERITS
OF THEIR LOCKABLE CONTAINER,
KITCHEN SAFE.
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT MATTERS TO ME PERSONALLY.
AND SO YOU MAY THINK
IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP,
BUT I DON'T CARE.
I'M INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE
THAT CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE,
HELPING PEOPLE OUT,
TO MAKE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME,
AND THAT'S GREAT.
I HOPE THAT HAPPENS.
AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT? I KNOW
THERE'S A MARKET OUT THERE.
I KNOW
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
WE'RE GONNA GET THE PRICE DOWN
TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO,
BUT FRANKLY,
EVEN AT A $49 PRICE,
IT WORKS,
AND THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.
WELL SAID.
Greiner:
AND TELL -- TELL ME --
John: I LIKE YOUR PASSION,
SO HERE'S MY OFFER --
$100,000 FOR 20%.
AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR
WHY IT MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU.
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT,
AND...IT'S HARD.
IT'S HARD TO HAVE
THAT TEMPTATION
AROUND YOUR HOUSE
EVERY DAY.
WE USED TO BUY
A THING OF ICE CREAM,
AND WE'D EAT HALF OF IT,
AND THEN I'D THROW IT AWAY
BECAUSE IF IT WAS THERE,
I WOULD EAT IT.
I'M THE SAME WAY.
I'M THE SAME WAY.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
THAT'S WHAT IT STARTED WITH,
AND WHEN I --
YOU KNOW,
Krippendorf:
I MEAN, I PERSONALLY THINK,
YOU KNOW, THAT THE COMPANY'S
WORTH MORE THAN THAT --
A LOT MORE THAN THAT.
APPARENTLY NOT.
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
WE HAVE A BETTER OFFER
FOR YOU.
LORI AND I
HAVE REVISED OUR OFFER.
WE'RE NOW OFFERING YOU
$100,000 FOR 20%,
MATCHING DAYMOND'S OFFER.
'CAUSE WE'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS.
IT REMINDS ME
OF WHEN I STARTED GoPro.
YOU'RE NOT JUST SELLING CRAP,
LIKE O'LEARY THINKS YOU ARE.
THERE'S PURPOSE
TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
BOTH OF US
BELIEVE IN YOU,
AND WE BELIEVE IN WHAT WE CAN
ALL DO TOGETHER AS A TEAM.
AND THEY OBVIOUSLY
DON'T LISTEN VERY WELL,
'CAUSE YOU'VE SAID
MULTIPLE TIMES
THAT YOU BELIEVE
THE VALUATION IS FAR HIGHER --
MARK, YOU GONNA MAKE AN OFFER
OR GIVE THEM A LECTURE?
I'M JUST LISTEN--
I'M JUST WAITING,
LETTING THESE GUYS TALK
'CAUSE THEY LIKE
TO HEAR THEMSELVES TALK.
GUYS, I SAID EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SAID 20 MINUTES AGO,
WHEN NOBODY ELSE WAS
ON THE TABLE.
WILL YOU DO 20%
FOR $200,000?
Greiner: NO.
NO.
AH, REALITY.
Woodman: AND HERE'S
THE REASON WHY.
IT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO
BECOME INVESTED PERSONALLY
IN YOUR BUSINESS
AND HELP YOU GUYS SUCCEED.
MARK, ARE YOU OUT?
NO.
OH, MY GOD.
[ LAUGHS ]
I NEVER SAID I WAS OUT.
John: GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOTICING
YOU COUNTERED OVER THERE,
AND THEN
YOU'RE TALKING TO MARK.
YOU ALREADY KNEW
WHERE KEVIN WAS HEADING.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
ADDRESSING ME,
SO MAYBE I'M NOT
THE RIGHT PERSON...
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT YOU WANT
TO DO THE DEAL WITH.
I DON'T WANT
TO BLUR YOUR VISION.
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY INTERESTED
IN WORKING --
OKAY, I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING TO ME AND THEM.
WELL, I THINK WE'RE INTERESTED
IN HEARING EVERYONE'S OPINION,
AND --
YES, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE LIKE DECISIVE PARTNERS.
YOU HAVE TO
MAKE A DECISION.
Let's just take it.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE REALLY WANTED TO WORK
WITH LORI AND NICK,
AND ALSO DAYMOND,
WHEN WE CAME IN,
BUT WE GET
TWO OF YOU GUYS.
YEAH.
WE WOULD BE THRILLED
TO TAKE YOUR OFFER.
WHOO-HOO!
YAY.
Tseng: THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DAYMOND.
Woodman:
HEY, NICE WORK.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
DO YOU MIND
IF I DOCUMENT THIS MOMENT?
OH, GoPro.
[ CAMERA BEEPS ]
GROUP HUG!
[ GRUNTS ]
NOW YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'RE GONNA
GET THAT PRICE DOWN.
SWEET!
CONGRATS, ROOK.
GOOD JOB.
THANK YOU.
John:
I LOVE YOUR PASSION.
YOUR DECISION-MAKING SUCKS.
Krippendorf: I'M REALLY EXCITED
THAT WE HAVE NICK AND LORI.
OUR GOAL WAS NOT JUST
TO BUILD A SMALL COMPANY.
WE WANT TO BUILD THIS INTO
A $100-MILLION-A-YEAR COMPANY,
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GONNA
BE A HUGE STEP FOR US.
