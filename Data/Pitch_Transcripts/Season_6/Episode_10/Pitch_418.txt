MY NAME IS CAMERON SHELDRAKE.
I'M FROM ITHACA, NEW YORK.
Sheldrake:
OH, IS THAT GOOD, BARRY?
UNFORTUNATELY,
OUR SUPPLY OF FRESH SWEET CORN
HI. I'M CAMERON SHELDRAKE,
AND MY COMPANY IS OFF THE COB.
I'M SEEKING $100,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10-- OR 15%...
[ LAUGHS ]
...OF MY COMPANY.
IT <i>ALREADY</i> WENT UP?
WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER EAT --
SWEET CORN OR GRAIN CORN?
DID YOU KNOW
THAT MOST TORTILLA CHIPS
ARE MADE WITH GRAIN CORN?
Sheldrake: YEAH, WE JUST
LAUNCHED THIS NEW PACKAGING
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
HOW LONG AGO
DID YOU LAUNCH THIS?
THIS IS VERY GOOD.
WE'VE ONLY BEEN SELLING CHIPS
FOR 13 MONTHS.
WHERE IS IT SOLD?
IT'S SOLD
IN NATURAL GROCERY STORES,
CAMERON,
I THINK THESE ARE GREAT.
UM...THE CHALLENGE IS, THOUGH,
AS AN INVESTOR,
I HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO SEE MY WAY TO A RETURN --
2X, 5X, 7X, 10X --
WHATEVER IT MAY BE.
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT MY PLAN FOR GROWTH.
TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR PLAN FOR GROWTH.
OKAY, SO, 2014,
WE'RE GONNA BE IN 400 STORES.
YEAH, CAMERON,
SOME CLOSE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
HAD TO BECOME GLUTEN-FREE
RECENTLY,
SO I'VE BEEN TASTING
A LOT OF GLUTEN-FREE PRODUCTS.
OKAY.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
O'Leary:
GOOD LUCK, CAMERON.
YOU WILL SUCCEED.
Sheldrake:
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THAT NONE OF THE SHARKS
MADE AN OFFER.
I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD
FOR THIS,
