MY NAME IS CAMERON SHELDRAKE.
I'M FROM ITHACA, NEW YORK.
AND I'M THE FOUNDER
OF OFF THE COB.
MY FAMILY FARM HAS BEEN
OPERATING HERE SINCE THE '60s,
SO, NATURALLY, FARMING IS
A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE.
ONE OF THE CROPS WE GROW
A TON OF IS FRESH SWEET CORN.
EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY LOVES IT,
INCLUDING MY DOG.
Sheldrake:
OH, IS THAT GOOD, BARRY?
UNFORTUNATELY,
OUR SUPPLY OF FRESH SWEET CORN
OFTEN OUTWEIGHS THE DEMAND,
SO WE END UP
THROWING AWAY A LOT.
I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS CORN,
SO I MADE A PLAN TO CHANGE IT
FROM WASTEFUL TO TASTEFUL.
THERE'S A NEED FOR MY PRODUCT
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON.
IT WAS
REALLY GOOD PICKING.
MY BUSINESS IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME
BECAUSE WE'RE HELPING
TO SUSTAIN MY FAMILY FARM,
AND SO IF I DON'T GET A DEAL
FROM THE SHARKS,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.
HI. I'M CAMERON SHELDRAKE,
AND MY COMPANY IS OFF THE COB.
I'M SEEKING $100,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10-- OR 15%...
[ LAUGHS ]
...OF MY COMPANY.
IT <i>ALREADY</i> WENT UP?
WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER EAT --
SWEET CORN OR GRAIN CORN?
DID YOU KNOW
THAT MOST TORTILLA CHIPS
ARE MADE WITH GRAIN CORN?
GRAIN CORN HAS HARD, DRY KERNELS
AND A STARCHY FLAVOR.
IT'S MACHINE-HARVESTED
IN THE FALL,
ONCE THE PLANT HAS DIED
AND THE KERNELS HAVE HARDENED
ON THE COB.
GRAIN CORN IS USED
MOSTLY TO FEED TO ANIMALS
AND TO MAKE ETHANOL.
I PREFER FRESH SWEET CORN,
LIKE YOU'D BOIL OR GRILL
AND EAT RIGHT OFF THE COB,
AND THAT'S WHY I STARTED
OFF THE COB
SWEET CORN TORTILLA CHIPS.
WE MAKE THE FIRST
AND ONLY TORTILLA CHIPS
WITH FRESH-PICKED SWEET CORN.
SWEET CORN GIVES OUR CHIPS
A SAVORY, SWEET,
REAL CORN-ON-THE-COB FLAVOR,
NOT THAT BLAND, STARCHY FLAVOR
GRAIN CORN GIVES MOST CHIPS.
NOT ONLY DO OFF THE COB
SWEET CORN TORTILLA CHIPS
TASTE BETTER,
BUT THEY'RE BETTER <i>FOR</i> YOU.
THEY'RE MADE WITH ORGANIC,
NON-GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN.
THEY'RE GLUTEN-FREE,
NO CHOLESTEROL, NO TRANS FAT,
AND VERY LOW SODIUM.
SO, SHARKS, WHO WANTS TO HELP ME
CHANGE THE CHIP IN YOUR DIP?
ARE YOU GONNA
LET US TRY SOME?
OF COURSE.
GREAT.
GREAT NAME, BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
Woodman: IT SAYS IT ALL
IN THE NAME, AND IT'S FUN.
THANK YOU.
SOME SALSA.
THANK YOU.
Woodman:
GREAT PACKAGING, TOO.
Sheldrake: YEAH, WE JUST
LAUNCHED THIS NEW PACKAGING
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
HOW LONG AGO
DID YOU LAUNCH THIS?
THIS IS VERY GOOD.
WE'VE ONLY BEEN SELLING CHIPS
FOR 13 MONTHS.
WHERE IS IT SOLD?
IT'S SOLD
IN NATURAL GROCERY STORES,
SUCH AS WHOLE FOODS AND WEGMANS
IN THE NORTHEAST.
IT'S HARD
TO GET INTO WEGMANS.
HOW MANY STORES?
WE'RE IN 45 STORES
RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE A QUESTION.
I NEVER REALIZED
THAT THE TORTILLA CHIPS
OR CORN CHIPS THAT WE EAT
ARE FROM GRAIN CORN.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO PUT
THE SWEET CORN IN THE CHIP.
IT'S ACTUALLY
20 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN CONVENTIONAL CORN.
MM.
WE'RE PAYING $5.50 A POUND
FOR DRIED SWEET CORN.
MOST GRAIN-CORN FLOUR COSTS
ABOUT 30 CENTS A POUND.
Greiner: SO, WHAT IS
A BAG OF THESE...
WOW.
WHOA.
REALLY?
...COMPARED
TO A BAG OF CHIPS
THAT IS GRAIN CORN
THE SAME SIZE?
MOST CONVENTIONAL TORTILLA CHIPS
ARE, LIKE, 99 CENTS.
WE'RE A LITTLE BIT
MORE EXPENSIVE.
WE'RE AT $3.49
AT WHOLE FOODS.
WE WERE ACTUALLY
IN 20 WHOLE FOODS AT ONE POINT,
BUT WE WERE OUT OF STOCK
FOR SO LONG, WE LOST OUR SPACE,
SO RIGHT NOW, I'M BATTLING
TO GET BACK THAT SPACE.
THEY TASTE GREAT,
BUT THE DELTA IN PRICE
BETWEEN THE 30 CENTS
I CAN BUY GRAIN CORN FOR
AND THE $5
I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS,
IT'S NOT REFLECTED, IN MY VIEW,
IN THE TASTE DIFFERENCE.
WELL, I THINK THERE'S
A GROWING AMOUNT OF PEOPLE
THAT ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S HEALTHIER.
NO, I GET --
THAT'S ON-TREND,
BUT THEN
YOU RUN INTO THE PROBLEM
WE'VE SEEN MANY TIMES
ON "SHARK TANK"
WHEN PEOPLE COME IN
WITH HEALTHIER OPTIONS
AND THEN RUN INTO
THAT GRAVITY OF DISTRIBUTION --
THE CHALLENGING
OF CONVINCING LARGE --
THERE'S WHOLE FOODS
EVERYWHERE.
WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD, TOTAL,
IN THE LIFETIME?
ABOUT 45,000 SO FAR.
THAT'S YOUR SALES?
DOLLARS?
YEAH.
DOLLARS?
YOU'RE NOT
MAKING ANY MONEY YET.
NO.
OKAY.
IF ANOTHER YEAR GOES BY
AND YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY MONEY,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
BECAUSE IN JANUARY,
WE'RE STARTING WITH THE LARGEST
DISTRIBUTOR OF NATURAL FOODS
IN THE UNITED STATES
AND GOING OUT TO 100 STORES.
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING IT FOR
RIGHT NOW?
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S ABOUT 85 CENTS.
OH!
Greiner: PER BAG?
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT
TO THE DISTRIBUTORS FOR?
FOR $1.60 TO $1.70
PER BAG.
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A VERY SIMPLE MODEL.
IF THE BUSINESS,
AFTER THREE YEARS,
ISN'T MAKING MONEY,
I CALL IT A HOBBY.
AND IF IT'S NOT
A HOBBY OF YOURS,
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT
BEHIND THE BARN AND SHOOT IT.
SO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER 12 MONTHS
TO PROVE
THAT THIS THING CAN MAKE MONEY.
I FIND YOUR COST INSANE.
LOOK, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE PRODUCT. I LIKE IT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO SIT AROUND
AND EXPLAIN TO EVERYBODY
THAT IT'S DIFFERENT,
AND THAT'S PART
OF YOUR MARKETING CHALLENGE.
I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE THE RIDE WITH YOU,
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK THE OUTCOME
IS GONNA BE A GOOD ONE.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
CAMERON,
I THINK THESE ARE GREAT.
UM...THE CHALLENGE IS, THOUGH,
AS AN INVESTOR,
I HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO SEE MY WAY TO A RETURN --
2X, 5X, 7X, 10X --
WHATEVER IT MAY BE.
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT MY PLAN FOR GROWTH.
TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR PLAN FOR GROWTH.
OKAY, SO, 2014,
WE'RE GONNA BE IN 400 STORES.
AND HOW MUCH REVENUE
WILL THAT CREATE?
THAT'LL CREATE $1.1 MILLION
IN REVENUE.
AFTER ALL THE COSTS,
IT'S ABOUT A 15% NET PROFIT.
SO THAT'S $165,000
IN NET PROFIT, HOPEFULLY, RIGHT?
AND THEN WE HAVE TO
REINVEST THAT INTO THE BUSINESS
AND WE HAVE TO
KEEP ON GROWING IT.
IT'S GONNA BE A GRIND,
RIGHT?
GOING INTO
THE ORGANIC-SNACK-FOOD MARKET --
IT'S VERY, VERY COMPETITIVE,
IT'S NOT EASY.
BUT YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PRODUCT,
BUT I JUST DON'T --
I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN GET A RETURN QUICK ENOUGH,
AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY, MARK.
YEAH, CAMERON,
SOME CLOSE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
HAD TO BECOME GLUTEN-FREE
RECENTLY,
SO I'VE BEEN TASTING
A LOT OF GLUTEN-FREE PRODUCTS.
OKAY.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
AND I REALIZED
HOW CHALLENGING IT IS
FOR SHELF SPACE,
LIKE O'LEARY ALWAYS SAYS.
I JUST THINK
THAT IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE
THAT I-I CAN'T TAKE
WITH YOU.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
BUT GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
Greiner:
I THINK THEY'RE WONDERFUL.
I DON'T REALLY BUY
TORTILLA CHIPS THAT MUCH,
AND I WOULD BUY THESE.
I LOVE THAT YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
WITH SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
THE SAME FOR SO MANY YEARS.
BUT I DO THINK IT WILL BE
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
FOR US TO SCALE AND FOR ME
TO GET BACK MY MONEY ON THIS.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
IF I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
AND ATE IT,
I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN
AND EAT IT AGAIN.
AT $3?
YEAH.
I WOULD NOT BE
THAT PRICE-SENSITIVE TO THIS.
I THINK THAT THE PACKAGING
IS FABULOUS.
IT'S FUN. IT MAKES YOU HAPPY
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT.
I THINK "OFF THE COB" --
PEOPLE GET IT RIGHT AWAY.
IT SOUNDS FRESH.
THE MARKETER IN ME
WANTS TO INVEST IN THIS,
BUT THE BUSINESSMAN IN ME
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SCALE
A BUSINESS LIKE THIS.
MM-HMM.
I WANT YOU
TO STICK WITH THIS,
'CAUSE YOU ARE
GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
[ SNORES ]
YOU'RE GONNA GRIND,
LIKE MARK SAID...
O'Leary: UGH.
...BUT I'M OUT.
THESE ARE FABULOUS.
THANK YOU, SHARKS.
John: ALL RIGHT, MAN.
GOOD LUCK.
John: GOOD LUCK.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
O'Leary:
GOOD LUCK, CAMERON.
YOU WILL SUCCEED.
Sheldrake:
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THAT NONE OF THE SHARKS
MADE AN OFFER.
I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD
FOR THIS,
AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP DOING
WHAT WE'RE DOING
AND KEEP SELLING CHIPS.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS
A UNIQUE WAY TO COOK ON THE GO.
