Hersh:
IT WASN'T ME THAT DID IT.
DID YOU GET
ANY OF THE $162 MILLION?
NO, NO, NO.
OH!
I'M HUNGRY TO GET IT WITH THIS.
Herjavec:
SO, YOU WORKED THERE,
BUT YOU WEREN'T AN OWNER
OF ROSETTI?
Cuban: STEPHEN, I LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE HONEST
Herjavec: STEPHEN --
I APPRECIATE IT.
FUNDAMENTALLY, HERE'S
WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY.
"I HAVE A PRODUCT
SO, STEPHEN,
THIS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS.
IT REQUIRES
THE DEMONSTRATION,
EITHER ONLINE OR ON TELEVISION
OR AN INFOMERCIAL.
BUT, FOR ME, I'M OUT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
THANK YOU.
John: I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT THE STRATEGY.
UNLESS YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN TYPE OF STORE,
STEPHEN HAS AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE FROM DAMON --
$500,000 FOR 33% OF HIS FOLDABLE
LUGGAGE COMPANY, BIAGGI.
BUT LORI MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED.
ALL RIGHT.
TIME IS UP.
LORI, ARE YOU GONNA
GIVE HIM AN OFFER OR NOT?
I AM GONNA GIVE HIM
AN OFFER.
HURRY UP!
O'Leary: TODAY?
SO, I'M GOING TO OFFER YOU
THE $500,000.
I ALSO WANT 33%.
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT
OF A NEW NAME, PACKAGING.
THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH DECISION.
SHE'S ALREADY
CHANGING THE NAME.
SHE'S GIVING YOU
A JANET JACKSON DEAL.
Herjavec: HOW IS THAT
A JANET JACKSON DEAL?
Greiner: THAT'S CRAZY.
'CAUSE SHE WANTS CONTROL.
O'Leary:
THINK ABOUT THIS.
I'M NOT GOING TO INSULT HIM
BECAUSE I'M A GOOD PERSON.
O'Leary: YOU'VE GOT
TWO OFFERS -- TWO OFFERS!
STEPHEN, YOU'VE GOT
TWO SMOKING-HOT OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU'RE GONNA LET YOURSELF
STEP OFF THE CARPET?
YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PICK ONE.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT, STEPHEN.
LET'S RESET THE TABLE.
OKAY.
YOU HAVE TWO VERY VALID OFFERS
FROM TWO SHARKS,
EACH OFFERING YOU $500,000
FOR 33 1/3%.
THEY'RE IDENTICAL.
IT'S TURNED
INTO A BEAUTY CONTEST.
NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
OKAY.
ONE SECOND.
I WANT TO MAKE
ONE STATEMENT.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS
YOUR NEXT PLAN OF ACTION?
STORES?
OR IS YOUR PLAN DEMONSTRABLE
ON THE QVC
OR HSNs OF THE WORLD?
DEMONSTRABLE,
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE.
LISTEN.
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
TO GO DOWN THAT PATH,
EVEN THOUGH I WORK WITH HSN,
SHE HAS
AN EXISTING CUSTOMER BASE.
SHE WILL DO AMAZING THINGS
WITH IT.
I HATE
ACTUALLY SAYING THAT.
I'M GONNA STEP OUT.
WHOA!
[ SIGHS ]
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW WE KNOW
A LOT OF THE SAME PEOPLE,
I KNOW WE'VE WORKED BASICALLY
IN THE SAME BUILDING.
LORI, I -- I KNOW
YOU CAN KILL THIS ON QVC,
GOOD JOB, STEPHEN.
Herjavec: GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU.
I THINK IT'S VERY CLEVER.
IT REALLY SOLVES A PROBLEM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD. WELL, WELCOME
TO MY SHARK FAMILY.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD.
THANK YOU.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
DAMON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU OUT THERE.
John: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TO BE
MR. KNOW-IT-ALL
