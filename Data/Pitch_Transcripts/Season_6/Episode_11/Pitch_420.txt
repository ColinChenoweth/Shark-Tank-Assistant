MY NAME IS STEPHEN HERSH, AND
I'M FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT, SHOOT IT!
I LIVE WITH MY TWO KIDS,
AVY AND LEAH.
MY KIDS ARE AWESOME.
THEY MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME.
GROWING UP, I WATCHED MY FATHER
START AND RUN A HANDBAG COMPANY.
HE PUT EVERY PENNY HE HAD INTO
IT, AND HE TOOK A VERY BIG RISK.
AND HE DID IT.
HE BROKE OPEN ALL OF THE MAJOR
DEPARTMENT STORES,
AND HIS BUSINESS TOOK OFF
VERY QUICKLY AFTER THAT.
EVENTUALLY, MY FATHER AND
HIS PARTNER SOLD THEIR COMPANY
FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY.
I DIDN'T GET ANY OF THE PROFITS,
AND I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT.
I DON'T FEEL THAT I'M ENTITLED
TO GET SOMETHING
THAT I DIDN'T EARN.
NOW MY DAD AND I
HAVE STARTED A NEW COMPANY
IN A SIMILAR INDUSTRY.
I GOT THOSE DESIGNS.
I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW.
WHEN WE STARTED THIS COMPANY,
WE BOUGHT A TON OF INVENTORY,
HE HIRED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
WE HADN'T EVEN SOLD ONE BAG YET,
AND WE WERE SPENDING
ALL THIS MONEY.
I HAD TO STOP MANUFACTURING
MY PRODUCT TEMPORARILY.
MOST OF WHAT I'M DOING NOW
IS PLANNING FOR A RELAUNCH
OF MY COMPANY.
I'VE LEARNED FROM MY MISTAKES,
AND IT'S TIME TO ASK FOR HELP.
A PARTNERSHIP
WITH THE RIGHT SHARK
CAN BRING MY BUSINESS BACK,
AND IT CAN BE JUST AS SUCCESSFUL
AS MY DAD'S BUSINESS WAS BEFORE.
HI. I'M STEPHEN HERSH,
AND I'M FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
MY COMPANY IS BIAGGI,
AND I'M SEEKING
AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 30%
OF MY COMPANY.
WHETHER WE LIVE IN A HOUSE,
A CONDO, OR AN APARTMENT,
IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE
WE HAVE SO MUCH STUFF
AND NOT ENOUGH SPACE
TO STORE IT IN.
VERY FEW THINGS EAT UP
MORE OF OUR LIVING SPACE
THAN OUR LUGGAGE.
BIAGGI LUGGAGE
IS YOUR STORAGE SOLUTION.
ALL BIAGGI LUGGAGE FOLDS FLAT.
OUR FOLDABLE SUITCASES
USE HINGE-LOCK TECHNOLOGY...
...WHICH KEEPS THESE BAGS STURDY
WHILE IN USE
AND EASY TO STORE
UNDER A BED OR ON A SHELF.
OUR SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT ZIPSAK
IS A SMALL POUCH
THAT AMAZINGLY TRANSFORMS
INTO THIS FULLY FEATURED
FOUR-WHEELED SPINNER.
IN THIS STANDARD PIECE
OF BEDROOM FURNITURE,
I'VE STORED 11 PIECES
OF LUGGAGE.
THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE SPACE
THAT THIS LUGGAGE WOULD TAKE UP
IN YOUR HOME.
OUR LUGGAGE IS THE LUGGAGE
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING
AND ALSO WHEN YOU'RE NOT.
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU
CAN WE WELCOME TO THE FOLD?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, PROVE TO ME PEOPLE CARE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
YES. SO, WE'VE HAD $2.5 MILLION
OF SALES IN TWO YEARS.
WOW.
SO, THE FIRST YEAR
WAS A FULL YEAR OF SELLING.
THIS YEAR,
WE SOLD FOR SIX MONTHS.
AND THEN, BASICALLY,
WE HIT PAUSE ON MANUFACTURING
BECAUSE WE DID LEARN
SOME THINGS,
AND WE DECIDED
THAT INSTEAD OF --
SO, WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
WHAT WE LEARNED WAS
THAT CONSUMER EDUCATION
IS THE CHALLENGE
WITH THIS PRODUCT.
WE BOUGHT A TON OF INVENTORY
STRAIGHT OFF THE BAT.
AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY
A MISTAKE.
WHEN YOU HIT THE ROADBLOCK,
YOU HAD TO LIQUIDATE
A LOT OF YOUR INVENTORY.
CORRECT.
SO, HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
DO YOU HAVE IN THIS?
WE INVESTED $3.5 MILLION
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
WOW!
$3.5 MILLION?!
WE DIDN'T LOSE $3.5 MILLION, BUT
WE INVESTED THAT OFF THE BAT.
WHO IS "WE"?
ME AND MY FAMILY
AND OUR LONG-TIME PARTNER
FROM THE LAST BUSINESS
THAT WE WERE IN.
WHAT WAS THE LAST BUSINESS?
THE LAST BUSINESS
WAS A HANDBAG BUSINESS.
AND WAS THE NAME
OF THE HANDBAG BUSINESS?
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE?
THE NAME OF THE HANDBAG BUSINESS
IS ROSETTI.
WE SOLD IT FOR $162 MILLION.
WOW.
GOOD FOR YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Hersh:
IT WASN'T ME THAT DID IT.
DID YOU GET
ANY OF THE $162 MILLION?
NO, NO, NO.
OH!
I'M HUNGRY TO GET IT WITH THIS.
Herjavec:
SO, YOU WORKED THERE,
BUT YOU WEREN'T AN OWNER
OF ROSETTI?
NO, MY FATHER WAS THE OWNER
OF ROSETTI, HIM AND --
HE DIDN'T THROW YOU A BONE?
YOU KNOW WHAT? MY FATHER DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN DOING THAT.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I LOVE HIM!
Greiner: NEITHER DO YOU.
I LOVE THE GUY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW MUCH DOES
THE PINK BAG COST,
AND WHAT
DO YOU MAKE IT FOR?
OKAY, $62 TO LAND IT
IN THE UNITED STATES.
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.
John: THAT'S A LOT.
BUT GO AHEAD.
AND WHAT
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
YEAH. SO, WE SELL IT
WHOLESALE FOR $124.
MM-HMM.
AND IT RETAILS FOR $269.
THAT'S FOR THE LARGEST SIZE.
AND WHO
ARE YOU SELLING TO?
John: RIGHT.
SO, THIS WAS THE BLESSING
AND THE CURSE WITH BIAGGI.
SO, WHEN WE FIRST
STARTED BIAGGI,
BEFORE WE EVEN BROUGHT A PIECE
OF LUGGAGE INTO THIS COUNTRY,
WE GOT AN ORDER FROM
A LARGER DEPARTMENT STORE
TO PUT US INTO 100 STORES
WITH 2 OF OUR LINES.
IT WAS -- WE WERE REALLY
EXCITED, OBVIOUSLY.
AND --
SO AM I.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
YEAH. THERE WAS A MAJOR ISSUE
THAT HAD TO BE FIGURED OUT,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY
TALKING TO YOU.
BUT CONSUMER EDUCATION
ON THE FLOOR.
SO, EVEN THE SALES PEOPLE
DIDN'T KNOW
THAT IT COLLAPSED, RIGHT?
I WENT INTO ONE STORE.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
WE HAVE --
BUT WAIT.
IT GETS WORSE.
THIS IS THE STORAGE BAG.
WHEN YOU FOLD THIS LUGGAGE,
IT COMES IN A STORAGE BAG
LIKE THIS.
SO, I GO TO ONE STORE, AND ALL
I SEE ON THE FLOOR ARE THESE.
Greiner: OH, NO.
THAT'S IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S IT.
John: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE LUCKY THEY EVEN
BROUGHT IT OUT OF THE BACK.
Cuban: STEPHEN, I LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE HONEST
AND JUST STRAIGHT UP
TO THE POINT, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
BUT WHAT
I'M REALLY HEARING IS,
NOW YOU'RE JUST IN THE LUGGAGE
GAME WITH ONE EXTRA FEATURE.
IT IS WHAT IT IS,
BUT IT'S NOT A BUSINESS
I WANT TO BE IN.
I'M OUT.
OKAY, I ACCEPT THAT.
AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
TO ME ANYWAYS.
Herjavec: STEPHEN --
I APPRECIATE IT.
FUNDAMENTALLY, HERE'S
WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY.
"I HAVE A PRODUCT
THAT THE CONSUMER
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND."
THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE.
AND THERE IS A LOT
OF COMPETITION.
I DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.
TOTALLY ACCEPT THAT, ROBERT,
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
LISTENING TO ME.
SO, STEPHEN,
THIS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS.
IT REQUIRES
THE DEMONSTRATION,
EITHER ONLINE OR ON TELEVISION
OR AN INFOMERCIAL.
BUT, FOR ME, I'M OUT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
THANK YOU.
John: I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT THE STRATEGY.
UNLESS YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN TYPE OF STORE,
IT'S REALLY THE JCPENNEYs
AND THE DILLARDs
AND THE BURLINGTONs.
THEY HAVE HUNDREDS
OF FEETS OF LUGGAGE,
AND IT'S VERY HARD
TO DIFFERENTIATE.
BUT I ACTUALLY JUST DID A DEAL
WITH HSN FOR LUGGAGE.
SO, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $500,000
FOR...YEAH, FOR 33%.
THAT'S A TERRIFIC OFFER, AND I
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, DAMON,
BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY
WANT TO --
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
THE OFFER NOW OR NOT?
A-ARE YOU GIVING ME AN ULTIMATUM
OF I HAVE TO TAKE IT NOW OR NOT,
ON THE SPOT?
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
AN ULTIMATUM.
I'LL ONLY GIVE YOU
20 SECONDS
'CAUSE I GOT A DEADLY SHARKETTE
THAT'S BEING QUIET.
BUT YOU HAVE 20 SECONDS.
AND SHE'S SWIMMING IN THE WATER
TOWARDS YOU.
20 SECOND, LORI.
COME ON. 20 SECONDS.
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN
IN THE LUGGAGE BUSINESS.
I HAVE SOLD HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF PIECES
OF MY WEEKENDER BAG
ON QVC.
10 SECONDS.
IT WAS UNIQUE.
IT HAD A CLEVER,
DIFFERENT FUNCTION.
SO, YOUR BAGS ARE
APPEALING TO ME
BECAUSE I KNOW MY CUSTOMER.
FIVE SECONDS.
SO, UM, I ALSO LIKE
THAT YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY
BEHIND YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
TIME IS UP.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
STEPHEN HAS AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE FROM DAMON --
$500,000 FOR 33% OF HIS FOLDABLE
LUGGAGE COMPANY, BIAGGI.
BUT LORI MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED.
ALL RIGHT.
TIME IS UP.
LORI, ARE YOU GONNA
GIVE HIM AN OFFER OR NOT?
I AM GONNA GIVE HIM
AN OFFER.
HURRY UP!
O'Leary: TODAY?
SO, I'M GOING TO OFFER YOU
THE $500,000.
I ALSO WANT 33%.
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT
OF A NEW NAME, PACKAGING.
THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH DECISION.
SHE'S ALREADY
CHANGING THE NAME.
SHE'S GIVING YOU
A JANET JACKSON DEAL.
Herjavec: HOW IS THAT
A JANET JACKSON DEAL?
Greiner: THAT'S CRAZY.
'CAUSE SHE WANTS CONTROL.
O'Leary:
THINK ABOUT THIS.
I'M NOT GOING TO INSULT HIM
BECAUSE I'M A GOOD PERSON.
O'Leary: YOU'VE GOT
TWO OFFERS -- TWO OFFERS!
IS IT OKAY IF I STEP OUT AND
MAKE A PHONE CALL ABOUT THIS?
STEPHEN, YOU'VE GOT
TWO SMOKING-HOT OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU'RE GONNA LET YOURSELF
STEP OFF THE CARPET?
YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PICK ONE.
John:
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,
I LIVE IN NEW YORK IN THE
GARMENT INDUSTRY LIKE YOU DO.
OOH.
SO WE CAN TALK OFTEN.
AND I'VE SEEN YOUR MAYBACH IN
THE PARKING LOT ON 33rd STREET.
THERE YOU GO.
LET THE GUY PICK.
I WORK AT LIGHTNING SPEED.
WE'LL HAVE THIS ON QVC
WITHIN FOUR MONTHS.
THANK YOU.
BE RIGHT BACK.
I HOPE NOTHING BAD HAPPENS.
BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
MAN: Hello?
HEY.
SO, I GOT TWO OFFERS,
ONE FROM DAMON JOHN AND THE
OTHER ONE IS FROM LORI GREINER.
Okay.
THEY BOTH HAVE ACCESS
TO ALL THE RETAILERS.
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME OFFER.
THEY WANT TO GIVE $500,000
FOR 33%.
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO TOUGH.
Look.
All I can tell you is, you
have to gauge which one of them
is really going to be
most interested,
but beyond HSN and QVC.
Greiner:
I THINK HE'S GONNA PICK YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK
AND HE WANTS YOUR MAYBACH.
WELL, I MEAN,
HOW MANY YEARS OF LUGGAGE
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?
THAT'S ONE OF YOUR CATEGORIES?
I'VE BEEN DOING LUGGAGE
FOR AT LEAST THE LAST DECADE.
AND THAT'S A CATEGORY.
YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR --
IT'S A STRONG CATEGORY
FOR ME.
I'VE SOLD HUNDREDS OF THOUS--
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS' WORTH.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT, STEPHEN.
LET'S RESET THE TABLE.
OKAY.
YOU HAVE TWO VERY VALID OFFERS
FROM TWO SHARKS,
EACH OFFERING YOU $500,000
FOR 33 1/3%.
THEY'RE IDENTICAL.
IT'S TURNED
INTO A BEAUTY CONTEST.
NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
OKAY.
ONE SECOND.
I WANT TO MAKE
ONE STATEMENT.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS
YOUR NEXT PLAN OF ACTION?
STORES?
OR IS YOUR PLAN DEMONSTRABLE
ON THE QVC
OR HSNs OF THE WORLD?
DEMONSTRABLE,
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE.
LISTEN.
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
TO GO DOWN THAT PATH,
EVEN THOUGH I WORK WITH HSN,
SHE HAS
AN EXISTING CUSTOMER BASE.
SHE WILL DO AMAZING THINGS
WITH IT.
I HATE
ACTUALLY SAYING THAT.
I'M GONNA STEP OUT.
WHOA!
[ SIGHS ]
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW WE KNOW
A LOT OF THE SAME PEOPLE,
I KNOW WE'VE WORKED BASICALLY
IN THE SAME BUILDING.
LORI, I -- I KNOW
YOU CAN KILL THIS ON QVC,
AND I'D BE HONORED
TO WORK WITH YOU.
WHOO-HOO! YAY.
O'Leary: OUTSTANDING.
Hersh: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
GOOD JOB, STEPHEN.
Herjavec: GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU.
I THINK IT'S VERY CLEVER.
IT REALLY SOLVES A PROBLEM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD. WELL, WELCOME
TO MY SHARK FAMILY.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD.
THANK YOU.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
DAMON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU OUT THERE.
John: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TO BE
MR. KNOW-IT-ALL
AND LET MY EGO GET IN THE WAY
WHEN THE BEST THING
FOR THAT ENTREPRENEUR --
LORI ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING
CUSTOMER THAT TRUSTS HER,
AND LORI WOULD BE BETTER
FOR HIM.
UGH!
THAT'S SO NASTY.
THAT TASTES SO NASTY.
WELL, THANK YOU, DAMON.
WHATEVER.
[ Chuckling ] OH!
Greiner:
WE'RE AT BED BATH &amp; BEYOND TODAY
TO SEE MY SPECIAL
"SHARK TANK" SECTION
THAT WILL BE FEATURED
AT SELECT STORES NATIONWIDE.
THIS SPECIAL SECTION FEATURES
SIX PRODUCTS I'VE INVESTED IN
FROM "SHARK TANK,"
AND I'VE BROUGHT THEM ALL DOWN
HERE TODAY
TO SEE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
JOINING ME ARE SCRUB DADDY,
DROP STOP,
READEREST, SCREENMEND,
INVISIPLUG, AND FiberFix.
THIS DISPLAY
IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
I HAVE EVER SEEN.
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
'CAUSE IT'S OUR PRODUCT.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
MIND-BLOWING.
EVERYTHING THAT LORI
TOUCHES IS COLD.
AND BEING ON HER DISPLAY
IS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLY
EXCITING EXPERIENCE.
THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL
FOR ALL OF US.
THESE ENTREPRENEURS ARE REALLY
PERFORMING FANTASTICALLY.
THEY'VE DONE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN SALES,
$62 MILLION COLLECTIVELY.
BEFORE GOING ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE'D ONLY DONE
ABOUT $4,000 IN SALES.
SINCE WE AIRED ON "SHARK TANK"
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO,
WE'VE DONE
OVER $1 MILLION IN SALES.
Man: THE KIND OF GROWTH WE'VE
EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST YEAR
IS REALLY UNHEARD OF.
WE'VE DONE $10 MILLION
IN SALES.
IN ONLY 9 MONTHS,
WE'VE GROSSED $800,000.
IN LESS THAN 3 YEARS, WE JUST
HIT $10 MILLION IN SALES.
Man #2: SINCE WE DEBUTED
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,
WE HAVE GROSSED
OVER $10 MILLION IN SALES.
Bilello: SINCE DOING A DEAL WITH
LORI ONLY TWO SHORT YEARS AGO,
WE'RE ABOUT TO REACH
$30 MILLION.
"SHARK TANK" IS NOT A SHOW.
IT'S A PHENOMENON.
LET'S GO CELEBRATE!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I'M THRILLED TO HAVE YOU AS PART
OF MY "SHARK TANK" FAMILY.
IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME THING
TO PUT A DEAL TOGETHER
LIKE THIS.
IT JUST MEANS SO MUCH TO ME
BECAUSE THEY CHOSE ME
AS THEIR SHARK.
AND I REALLY THINK
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
All: THANK YOU, LORI!
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR WITH AN
INNOVATION IN MEN'S GROOMING.
