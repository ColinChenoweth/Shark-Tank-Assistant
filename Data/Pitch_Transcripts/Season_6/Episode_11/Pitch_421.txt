AND I'M KURT.
WE'RE FROM OKLAHOMA,
AND OUR COMPANY
IS GAMEDAY COUTURE.
WE ARE SEEKING $500,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
SO, NOW,
WE ALL KNOW SPORTS FANS
ARE EXTREMELY PASSIONATE
ABOUT THEIR TEAMS, RIGHT?
SO, WE USED TO GET READY
TO GO TO THE BIG GAME.
AND I LOOK OVER AT THIS GUY,
AND HE WAS DECKED OUT
FROM HEAD TO TOE.
BUT I GO TO MY CLOSET,
AND I WAS LEFT
WITH EITHER
AN OVER-SIZED JERSEY
OR A LIGHT PINK T-SHIRT.
I THOUGHT, "REALLY?
COME ON.
WE CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT."
AND GAMEDAY COUTURE
WAS BORN.
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
WE TAKE WHAT'S TRENDING
IN THE FASHION WORLD
AND BRING IT TO THE FEMALE
SPORTS FAN MARKET.
HIGH-QUALITY FABRICS
AT COMPETITIVE PRICE POINTS.
AND GAMEDAY GIVES WOMEN
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO LOOK COMFORTABLE
YET STYLISH
OR DECKED OUT
FROM HEAD TO TOE.
SO, WE'RE A SUCCESS
IN THE SOUTH,
BUT WE WANT TO DRESS FANS
FROM ALL OVER.
WHO WANTS
TO JOIN TEAM GAMEDAY
AND MAKE A STATEMENT
WITH FAN FASHION?
OUR MODELS ARE GONNA
PASS OUT SOME SAMPLES
FOR YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
IT'S ALL FOR FEMALES,
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?
CURRENTLY, YES.
WE FOCUS ON THE FEMALE MARKET.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES SO FAR?
WE DID ABOUT $750,000
IN SALES LAST YEAR.
THIS YEAR,
WE'VE DONE ABOUT $1 MILLION.
WE'RE ON PACE
TO BE ABOUT $1.5 MILLION.
Herjavec: GREAT GROWTH.
IMPRESSIVE.
SO, I DID AN INVESTMENT
LAST SEASON, UH, TIP SALES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THEY MAKE
THE UGLY CHRISTMAS SWEATERS.
WE'RE KILLING IT.
WE'LL DO $4 MILLION THIS YEAR.
RIGHT.
WE'RE NOW EXPANDING
INTO THE COLLEGE MARKET.
Kurt: MM-HMM.
OKAY.
AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS,
IT'S VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE
TO BUY THE LICENSES
FROM EACH COLLEGE.
EXPENSIVE.
YEAH.
Herjavec: HOW MANY
COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES
DO YOU HAVE LICENSES FOR
ACROSS THE STATES?
AS WE STAND RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE ABOUT 37 LICENSES.
WE'VE GOT A FEW MORE
ON THE WAY.
O'Leary: TELL ME
THE AVERAGE PRICE POINT.
AVERAGE PRICE POINT'S $22,
WHOLESALE.
AVERAGE RETAIL'S $44.
WHAT DOES IT COST FOR YOU
TO MAKE IT?
ABOUT $8.
Greiner: RECENTLY, I WENT
TO A BLACKHAWKS GAME.
MY HUSBAND SAID, "YOU KNOW,
"IT'D BE GREAT
IF WE WORE SOMETHING,
THE COLORS, ET CETERA."
WE'RE ONLINE.
WE'RE LOOKING
AT ALL THE DIFFERENT SHIRTS.
I DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING
UNTIL I CAME TO ONE
THAT WAS LIKE YOURS...
MM-HMM.
...THAT WAS BLINGY.
SO, THAT'S WHAT I BOUGHT.
MY POINT IS THAT
YOUR PRICE POINT'S GOOD.
THANK YOU.
BECAUSE I THINK THAT MINE
COST LIKE $60-SOME-ODD.
AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
WE REALLY WORKED HARD
WITH A LOT OF OUR RETAILERS
AND THE UNIVERSITIES
DIRECTLY TO DEVELOP --
WHAT WE ARE KNOWN FOR
IS AN ALUMNI CUT
AT A COMPETITIVE
PRICE POINT.
HOW MUCH MONEY
WILL YOU MAKE THIS YEAR?
ABOUT $100,000
OUT OF $1.5 MILLION.
OKAY.
SO, IT'S NOT A LOT.
WHY ARE YOU WORTH $2.5 MILLION?
WE'RE WORTH $2.5 MILLION
BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT
ALL THE MONEY BACK IN
TO APPLYING
THE ADDITIONAL LICENSES,
SEEKING OUT THE MARKETS.
SO, LAST YEAR,
WHEN WE DID $750,000,
THAT WAS BASICALLY SHIPPED
ON JUST 10 SCHOOLS.
THAT'S CORRECT.
SO, LIKE, RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE ABOUT 37 SCHOOLS.
OKAY. I GET THAT.
Herjavec: WOW.
SO, YOU'VE BUILT A PLATFORM
UPON WHICH ONE DAY, WITH
SUCCESS, YOU'LL MAKE MONEY.
RIGHT.
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORTH $2.5 MILLION.
THE LICENSES ARE VALUABLE.
YOU'VE GOT THEM.
THAT'S CORRECT.
RELATIONSHIPS ARE VALUABLE.
YOU'VE GOT THEM.
THAT'S CORRECT.
THEN I ASK MYSELF,
"WHAT WOULD IT COST ME
TO GO CATCH UP WITH YOU?"
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING ME
IF I WANTED TO GET
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
I'M THINKING PROBABLY
IF I FUNDED $750,000,
I'D GET A TEAM LIKE YOU
AND I JUST RUN LIKE HELL
AND GET THOSE LICENSES, TOO.
YOU COULD GO OUT AND SPEND
A BUNCH OF MONEY ON IT,
BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?
I'VE ALREADY JUMPED
OVER ALL THE HURDLES,
AND I'M STILL SPRINTING.
WELL, I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT --
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY,
SO I --
WE'VE ALREADY DONE
ALL THE HARD WORK.
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY CASH FLOW.
I UNDERSTAND.
THE KEY TO BUSINESS
IS TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE RIGHT PRICE
TO BUY IN IS.
SURE. SURE.
BECAUSE IF YOU OVERPAY,
YOU DIE OF OLD AGE
BEFORE YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
I THINK YOU OVER-PRICED
YOUR BUSINESS.
I THINK YOU'RE WORTH
ABOUT $750,000.
I'D HAVE TO OWN, YOU KNOW,
75% OF YOU AT THIS PRICE.
I'M OUT.
AND I'LL LET SOMEONE ELSE
TRY AND FIGURE IT OUT.
SO, THE NBA CALLED ME,
AND THEY SAID, "HEY.
"WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A LICENSE
BECAUSE WE WANT YOU
TO MAKE FASHIONABLE STUFF
FOR ON-COURT AND OFF-COURT."
SO, I MADE THESE GREAT KNICKS
AND BULLS VELOUR SUITS.
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS,
THE KID JUST WANTED
THE $40 JERSEY WITH
HIS FAVORITE PLAYER ON IT.
THAT'S ALL HE WANTED.
SO, I ENDED UP HAVING
ABOUT $10 MILLION
IN INVENTORY THAT...
[ WHISTLES ]
...WAS PRETTY CHALLENGING.
I'M STILL LICKING
MY WOUNDS A LITTLE.
SORRY. I-I'M OUT.
THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GREAT
PIECE FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO
BACK DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN.
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO OUT ON THIS.
I'M STILL NOT THROUGH
MY CURRENT INVENTORY.
DAMON, I SEE
SOME GROVELING GOING ON.
CAN YOU TELL THEM
WHAT IT'S WORTH?
$1.5 MILLION.
HE'S VERY GENEROUS.
YOU'RE ONLY $1 MILLION
OVER VALUED.
THAT MEANS ROBERT CAN STEP UP
AND MAYBE DO SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S $500,000.
RIGHT?
IT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF MONEY.
NO, IT'S NOT.
SO, VALUATION MATTERS, ROB?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
PLEASE.
DON'T YOU HAVE THE VISION?
BUT EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING
IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU TO DO.
SURE.
I WOULD SIMPLY RUN
A LITTLE BIT FASTER.
YOU KNOW, DAMON THINKS
IT'S WORTH $1.5 MILLION.
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
I SAW IT BEING WORTH
AROUND $1 MILLION...
OKAY.
Herjavec: ...FOR THE RISK.
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
DISRESPECTFUL TO YOU.
YOU'RE NOT DISRESPECTFUL.
IT'S UNDERSTANDING
KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT
WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY.
IT IS WORTH A WHOLE LOT MORE
THAN WE'VE EVEN PROBABLY
GIVEN IT CREDIT FOR.
OF COURSE IT IS.
BECAUSE WE'VE SCRATCHED
THE SURFACE.
YOU KNOW, SHAWNNA,
FOR ME, TODAY,
IT'S WORTH
THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT...
TOTALLY.
I RESPECT THAT.
...AS AN INVESTOR.
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TAKE THAT.
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TAKE THAT.
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LORI OR MARK,
ANY OF YOU GUYS INTERESTED?
WHAT -- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING ONLINE?
WE JUST LAUNCHED ONLINE
LAST YEAR, RETAIL,
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON
OUR WHOLESALE BASE
AND GET THAT BUILT FIRST
BEFORE WE JUST BRANCHED
INTO TOO MANY THINGS.
BUT, GUYS, MOST OF YOUR BUSINESS
SHOULD BE ONLINE, RIGHT?
'CAUSE I WOULD THINK ANY ALUM,
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THEY'RE GONNA GET TO YOU.
CORRECT.
AND MOST OF OUR RETAILERS
SELL ONLINE.
AND THERE'S
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY.
LOOK. I'M KIND OF SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T GO THAT WAY SOONER
BECAUSE IT'S MORE OF A PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE.
SURE. SURE.
RIGHT?
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I'M MISSING
IN TERMS OF WHY
YOU DIDN'T GO ONLINE?
BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, WHEN
WE GO OBTAIN THESE LICENSES,
WE WORK WITH THESE
LICENSING DIRECTORS.
AND THEY WANT TO SEE US DO
SOMETHING WITH THE LICENSE.
IS THERE A LIMIT?
ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED
TO SELL ONLINE WITH YOUR --?
NO, YOU ARE. WE ARE.
YEAH, WE ARE. WE ARE.
BUT THEY REALLY WANT
TO SEE YOU TAKE THE LICENSE
AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WITHIN THE FIRST --
John: OKAY.
ONE SECOND.
IT'S VERY HARD TO SHOW
A LICENSING ORGANIZATION
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
ON THE INTERNET SAYING,
"I'M INTERESTED."
THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT.
BUT IT IS REALLY EASY TO SHOW
THEM ORDERS FROM 50 STORES
SAYING,
"THIS IS AN OFFICIAL ORDER."
DID THAT HAPPEN?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
OKAY.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
OKAY.
OKAY?
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU THE 500K.
OKAY.
FOR 30%.
OKAY.
OKAY?
BUT I HAVE A CAVEAT.
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT THE CAVEAT IS,
WHAT THE CONTINGENCY IS,
UNTIL YOU GIVE ME AN ANSWER.
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME
A LITTLE BIT.
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME --
ABSOLUTELY.
I DEFINITELY WANT TO --
I WANT TO RESPECT YOUR OFFER.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE DON'T LEAVE
ANYBODY OUT, LIKE LORI.
I'M NOT GONNA GO THERE, GUYS.
IF I'M NOT THE RIGHT PARTNER
FOR YOU, JUST TELL ME.
NO, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU ARE THE RIGHT PARTNER
FOR US.
A BIRD IN THE HAND.
YOU JUST GOT TO TELL ME
WHETHER WE HAVE A DEAL.
OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.
NOW I'M GONNA TELL YOU
MY CONDITION.
OH.
Greiner: YEAH.
OKAY.
MY WIFE KILLS ME
EVERY SINGLE YEAR
SAYING THE MAVS HAVE
HORRIBLE CLOTHING FOR WOMEN.
I'VE ALREADY GOT A DESIGN.
DEAL.
DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
Herjavec: WOW.
Cuban: IF I DIDN'T DO
A DEAL WITH YOU GUYS,
MY WIFE WOULD HAVE SHOT ME.
SHE WOULD.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
YOU GUYS ARE --
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.
THANKS, GUYS.
Kurt: SUPER FIRED UP
TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH MARK.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOMEBODY
THAT DOESN'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.
AND HE'S GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET US OPPORTUNITIES
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE.
Greiner:
IT WILL SELL GREAT.
John: BLING FOR WOMEN
IS LIKE THE LIGHT
THAT THE MOTH
KEEPS GOING TOWARD.
AND I WANT ONE.
DONE. AS LONG AS
IT SAYS MAVS ON IT.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS
AN ENTREPRENEUR WHO BELIEVES
HE HAS A BETTER SOLUTION
TO DRINKING WINE ON THE GO.
