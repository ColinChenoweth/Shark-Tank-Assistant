HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S ANDREW McMURRAY,
Herjavec: ANDREW, WHY IS IT
DIFFERENT THAN COPA DI VINO?
McMurray: WE GOT ABOUT
25 INVESTORS, TOTAL.
WE'VE GOT SIX RETIRED
GOLDMAN SACHS PARTNERS,
THREE OF WHICH OWN A
PROFESSIONAL SPORTING FRANCHISE.
KEVIN IS ANDREW'S LAST CHANCE
FOR A DEAL
FOR HIS SINGLE-SERVE
WINE COMPANY, ZIPZ.
O'Leary: SO, HOW DO YOU GET
THE PRICE DOWN
SO THAT WE CAN SELL
TO COSTCO FOR $1.06?
HOW DO WE DO THAT?
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
THE PACKAGING DOWN.
AT A $25 MILLION VALUATION,
ANDREW,
BECAUSE I BROUGHT COSTCO
TO THE TABLE.
BECAUSE WE GOT INTO COSTCO,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE WAY MORE VALUABLE.
YOUR PARTNERS KNOW THAT.
YOU SHOULD DO THIS DEAL.
YOU HAVE NO RISK.
JUST SAY YES.
[ CHUCKLES ]
TRUST ME.
ANDREW, IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY GOOD DEAL.
ANDREW, ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE MY DEAL OR NOT?
DON'T BE A FOOL.
I'M ON BOARD.
YAY!
ALL RIGHT.
CHEERS.
YAY! [ LAUGHS ]
Greiner: YAY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
McMurray: GOING IN TO THIS,
WE KNEW THAT KEVIN
WAS THE WINE GUY.
TO HAVE KEVIN O'LEARY,
MR. WONDERFUL,
PART OF OUR WINE PROJECT THAT
WE'RE DOING -- PRETTY EXCITED.
