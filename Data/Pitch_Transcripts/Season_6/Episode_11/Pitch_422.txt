HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S ANDREW McMURRAY,
AND I'M HERE
FROM SCARSDALE, NEW YORK.
OUR COMPANY
IS ZIPZ INCORPORATED.
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING
A $2.5 MILLION INVESTMENT
FOR A 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
OH.
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT OUR SINGLE-SERVE
IS LIKE NO OTHER
IN THE WINE INDUSTRY.
OUR COMPANY, IT'S ALL ABOUT
PACKAGING, PACKAGING, PACKAGING,
AND LICENSING,
LICENSING, LICENSING.
AND, KEVIN, I THINK THAT
SHOULD BE MUSIC TO YOUR EARS.
YOU ARE WISE, GRASSHOPPER.
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO, THE SINGLE SERVES THAT
ARE OUT IN THE MARKET TODAY,
WHAT YOU MIGHT BE MOST USED TO
THAT YOU SEE ON AIRPLANES,
THE LITTLE AIRPLANE BOTTLES,
LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS.
WE'VE GOT A WINE GLASS.
IT'S GOT WEIGHT,
AND IT'S GOT STRENGTH.
AND THIS GLASS IS ACTUALLY SO
STRONG THAT I CAN STAND ON IT.
Greiner: OH, MY GOD.
Herjavec: WOW.
WOW.
Greiner: WOW.
"WOW" IS RIGHT.
TO OPEN THIS GLASS OF WINE,
YOU'RE SIMPLY GONNA UNZIP
THE OUTER CLING WRAP.
THIS RECYCLABLE OUTER WRAP
ACTS AS A U.V. PROTECTANT
TO THE WINE,
WHICH IN SINGLE-SERVE WINE,
SHELF LIFE IS KING.
NOW, TO OPEN THE WINE, YOU'RE
SIMPLY GONNA UNSCREW THE LID...
Herjavec: OH.
...ATTACH IT TO THE BOTTOM.
OH!
VERY CLEVER.
THAT'S GREAT.
NOW, TO OPEN THE WINE,
YOU'RE SIMPLY GONNA LIFT
AND PEEL.
ONE OF THE BEST PARTS
ABOUT THIS NOW,
LID COMES BACK OFF,
SCREWS BACK ON.
THIS GLASS FALLS OVER, YOU'RE
NOT SPILLING ANY WINE OUT OF IT.
SO, LET ME QUICKLY GIVE YOU GUYS
EACH A GLASS SO YOU CAN HOLD IT.
IN OUR OPINION,
OUR PACKAGE IS GONNA BECOME
TO THE WINE INDUSTRY
WHAT THE ALUMINUM CAN BECAME
TO THE SODA INDUSTRY.
Greiner: CHEERS.
CHEERS.
O'Leary: SO, FOR VIEWERS
OUT THERE AND YOU, LORI,
WHO WEREN'T AROUND
WHEN THIS HAPPENED,
COPA DI VINO WAS ANOTHER
SINGLE-SERVE WINE DEAL
THAT CAME IN THE TANK TWICE.
BOTH TIMES, GOT OFFERS, AND HE
NEVER ACCEPTED EITHER OF THEM.
Herjavec: ANDREW, WHY IS IT
DIFFERENT THAN COPA DI VINO?
IT'S DIFFERENT IN THAT
WE OWN THE PATENTS AND --
O'Leary:
COPA DI VINO ASSURED US
THEY HAD A PATENT ON SEALING
A GLASS OF WINE THIS WAY.
SO --
SO, HOW HAVE YOU NOT
BREACHED THAT PATENT?
ACTUALLY, THE COMPANY THAT OWNS
THE RIGHTS TO THAT GLASS
AND TO THAT TECHNOLOGY IS
A COMPANY BASED OUT OF FRANCE.
IN SPEAKING WITH THE OWNER
OF THE COMPANY,
HE TOLD US THAT
THE PREVIOUS ENTREPRENEUR,
ESSENTIALLY, HE'S A --
LIKE A FRANCHISEE.
SO, HE HAD THE RIGHTS TO USE
HIS TECHNOLOGY FOR HIS GLASS.
SO, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOUR TWO PATENTS?
THE SHELF LIFE.
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO.
OUR GLASS LASTS FOR WELL
OVER A YEAR, SHELF LIFE.
WE'RE IN SHELF-LIFE TESTING
RIGHT NOW WITH THREE
OF THE TOP 10 GLOBAL BRANDS
IN THE WORLD TODAY.
ONE I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT,
WHICH IS YELLOWTAIL.
THEY DO CLOSE TO 10 MILLION
CASES A YEAR IN THE U.S. MARKET.
SO, WHAT I'M TRYING
TO CLARIFY WITH CERTAINTY --
BECAUSE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD
A LONG TIME AGO.
AND, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE DOING
BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY
'CAUSE HE WAS SWEATING LIKE
A PIG BY THIS POINT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
THE POINT IS,
YOU'RE TELLING ME,
AFTER HAVING VISITED
THE OWNER OF THE PATENT,
THAT THERE IS NO BREACH?
THEY HAVE AGREED THAT YOU DO
NOT INFRINGE ON THEIR PATENT?
THAT IS 100% CORRECT.
IS YOUR PATENT UNIQUE
NOT ONLY TO THE FORM FACTOR
BUT ALSO TO COAT THE GLASS
WITH THAT PLASTIC?
CORRECT.
THE MIX OF THE PLASTIC THAT'S
IN HERE IS PROPRIETARY TO US.
THAT'S WHAT --
ALONG WITH
THE EXTERIOR PACKAGE?
ALONG WITH THE EXTERIOR PACKAGE.
SO THOSE TWO THINGS --
THAT'S ALSO A PART OF THE PATENT
IS THE U.V. WRAP,
THE SHRINK WRAP ON THE OUTSIDE.
SO, THOSE TWO THINGS --
OKAY.
OKAY, LET'S PUT THE PATENT ASIDE
FOR A MOMENT.
OKAY. SURE.
YOU HAVE NO DESIRE
TO MAKE YOUR OWN WINE.
YOU WANT TO LICENSE
THIS PACKAGING
TO OTHER BIG WINE MANUFACTURERS
AND LET THEM SELL IT?
THE ANSWER WOULD BE NO AND YES
AND YES AND NO.
SO, WE ACTUALLY HAVE
OUR ZIPZ BRAND.
THAT'S WHAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU
RIGHT NOW.
THAT IS OUR BRAND.
IS IT IN COSTCO?
IT IS NOT IN COSTCO YET.
Greiner: WHAT --
AND THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF WHY
I'M HERE TALKING TO YOU TODAY.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
OKAY. THE PROJECT STARTED
ABOUT 16 MONTHS AGO.
WE ARE WORKING
WITH FETZER WINERY.
THE DEAL WITH THEM WAS
TO GET INTO SIX
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PARKS
FOR OPENING DAY OF 2013.
AND WE DID $130,000 WITH THEM
IN LICENSING FEES.
THEY TOOK YOUR TECHNOLOGY
AND PUT THEIR WINE INTO IT
AND SENT IT OVER
TO THE ARENAS?
CORRECT.
IS THAT THE LICENSE?
CORRECT.
WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE
ON THAT LICENSE?
IT'S 15 CENTS A GLASS.
HOW MUCH MONEY
IS TOTALLY INVESTED
IN THIS VENTURE RIGHT NOW?
$8.5 MILLION.
OH.
Herjavec: WOW.
WOW.
AND WHERE DID THAT MONEY
COME FROM?
McMurray: WE GOT ABOUT
25 INVESTORS, TOTAL.
WE'VE GOT SIX RETIRED
GOLDMAN SACHS PARTNERS,
THREE OF WHICH OWN A
PROFESSIONAL SPORTING FRANCHISE.
AND THE REST OF THIS GROUP,
THESE ARE ALL
WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS.
John:
BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES,
IF YOU HAVE
ALL THOSE TEAM OWNERS,
THEN WHY ARE YOU ASKING US
FOR THE MONEY?
I WANT ALL FIVE OF YOU GUYS
AT THE TABLE WITH ME.
WHAT'S IT SELL FOR?
WHAT'S YOUR TOTAL SALES?
THE ZIPZ BRAND THAT YOU'RE
HOLDING IN YOUR GLASS RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE CURRENTLY DONE
ABOUT $650,000 IN SALES.
WHAT DOES IT COST AT RETAIL,
A GLASS OF ZIPZ?
$2.99 PER GLASS.
O'Leary: LOOK.
VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL BUY
A GLASS OF WINE FOR 3 BUCKS.
WE'RE ALREADY IN 1,200 STORES.
WE JUST GOT WALMART THIS WEEK.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
IT COSTS ME 95 CENTS.
OOH. LOOK.
IN AMERICA, 97% OF WINE
IS SOLD FOR UNDER
$9.95 A BOTTLE.
SO, WHERE THIS PACKAGING IDEA
HAS SO MUCH MERIT
IN TERMS OF ITS DELIVERY,
IT FAILS ON ITS PRICING.
WHEN THE AVERAGE CONSUMER
SAYS TO HIMSELF,
"I CAN GET 5 1/2 GLASSES
FOR $9.99,
AND I HAVE TO PAY $3.99
FOR ONE,"
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YEAH, BUT THIS IS, YOU KNOW --
BUT THE -- YOU CAN'T DISMISS --
LIKE YOU SAID,
YOU CAN'T DISMISS THE PACKAGE.
BUT YOU'VE ONLY GOT $650,000
IN SALES, MY FRIEND.
THAT'S NOTHING
IN THE WINE BUSINESS.
I MEAN, EVERYONE WE'VE SPOKEN TO
IS COMFORTABLE
AT THE $2.99 PRICE POINT.
THEY HAVEN'T SOLD
THROUGH ANY.
THAT'S THE TIPPING POINT.
LIKE YOU SAID --
THEY HAVEN'T
TESTED THE MARKET.
THEY HAVEN'T SOLD IT THROUGH.
$650,000 IN 1,200 STORES
IS POO-POO.
POO-POO.
PEE-PEE, POO-POO.
BUT LET'S NOT GET HUNG UP
ON THOSE. NOW WE --
I'M HUNG UP.
I KNOW IT'S GETTING DE-LISTED.
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
NO. BUT WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY BRAND.
LOOK.
I'M NOT A WINE CONNOISSEUR.
BUT EVEN THEN,
I WOULD TAKE MD 20/20
FROM A QUALITY PERSPECTIVE
OVER A BRAND WITH
A ZIPPER NAMED ZIPZ.
HUGE MISTAKE.
I'M OUT.
LET ME TELL YOU
A VERY BRIEF STORY
THAT I THINK
WILL BE SOBERING FOR YOU.
I WENT TO SEE COSTCO
AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT WINE.
THEY'RE THE LARGEST BUYER
OF WINE ON EARTH.
SURE.
$5.2 BILLION IN WINE.
I SAID, "I'M GOING
INTO THE WINE BUSINESS."
THEY SAID, "WHO CARES?"
THERE'S 5,000 APPLICATIONS
A YEAR
TO PUT WINE FROM ALL AROUND
THE WORLD INTO COSTCO.
"GO PROVE THAT O'LEARY MEANS
SOMETHING IN THE WINE BUSINESS."
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO DO IT.
I GO BACK TO COSTCO.
AND SHE SAYS, "IMPRESSIVE.
BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH A NEW PRICE POINT."
WE TALKED ABOUT SINGLE SERVE.
WE TALKED ABOUT
750 MILLILITER BOTTLES.
WE TALKED ABOUT MY BRAND.
DID YOU GET YOUR WINE
INTO COSTCO?
I'M NEGOTIATING IT RIGHT NOW.
IT'S NOT IN YET.
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
John: THAT WOULD BE
A NO. OKAY.
WHAT IS YOUR LOSS
GONNA BE THIS YEAR?
WE -- I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT
AS A LOSS.
I WANT TO LOOK AT IT
AS A REINVESTMENT BACK.
WHY NOT SIMPLY LICENSE
TO THE BIG MANUFACTURERS,
TO THE BIG WINERIES,
AND LET THEM TAKE ALL OF THAT?
YOU'RE PUTTING UP
ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL.
THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE
OF A LICENSING DEAL.
WHY DO ANY OF IT?
WELL, I MEAN,
HINDSIGHT IS ALWAYS 20/20.
THAT'S THE ANSWER?
Cuban: NOW HE'S IN.
NO!
NOW HE'S TOO FAR IN.
HE'S GOT NO CHOICE.
OKAY. SO, AT THE PRICE OF $2.99
THAT YOU WANT TO SELL IT AT,
IF YOU DON'T GET
THE SELL-THROUGH
UP TO, CALL IT, 10 MILLION UNITS
IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS,
YOU'RE SCREWED.
YOU'VE RUN OUT OF RUNWAY.
SO, THE REAL ISSUE
IS GETTING BACK
TO HOW WE STARTED
OUR CONVERSATION TODAY,
WHEN WE KNOW EVERYBODY
IN AMERICA, WHICH IS 97%,
BUY WINE AT UNDER $9.99.
THAT'S 97% OF THE MARKET.
AND WHERE'S THAT FACT FROM?
I --
EVERYTHING I'M TELLING YOU
IS A FACT.
YOU'RE GONNA GO FIND THIS OUT
ON YOUR OWN.
John: MY GUT FEELING IS,
I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY
WITH THIS AMOUNT OF RISK.
I'M OUT.
OBVIOUSLY, I RESPECT THAT
AND I APPRECIATE IT.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
TO OPEN A CATEGORY
THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
ISN'T EASY.
IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE.
THE GUY'S BEEN STANDING THERE.
TWICE.
HE WAS HERE TWICE!
TO CLEAR THE AIR IN THAT SENSE,
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT A COPY CAT.
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
SINGLE-SERVE WINE SINCE 2008.
YOU KNOW, I THINK
BRILLIANT DESIGN.
I LOVE IT.
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I THINK
THAT THERE'S A GREAT USE FOR IT
IN CERTAIN APPLICATIONS.
BUT ALL THE REST OF THIS
IS SO COMPLICATED --
YOU HAVE SO MANY PARTNERS,
IT'S SO MUCH MONEY --
THAT FOR THAT REASON, I CAN'T
SEE MY WAY THROUGH THIS.
AND SO, I'M OUT.
Herjavec: YOU KNOW, WHEN
COPA DI VINO WAS HERE,
I REALLY LIKED
THE PRODUCT THEN.
I LIKE THE BETTER PRODUCT,
'CAUSE I THINK
YOU HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT.
BUT MY ISSUE IS EXACTLY
THE SAME AS IT WAS.
I DON'T CARE THAT
YOU'VE RAISED $8.5 MILLION.
FOR ME, IT IS VERY,
VERY FUNDAMENTAL.
IT'S A LICENSING DEAL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION.
KEVIN'S GONNA BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF YOU
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET BELOW
A CERTAIN PRICE POINT.
BUT YOU CAN'T GET BELOW
A CERTAIN PRICE POINT
BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN ON
ALL THE RISK.
IF YOU WERE
SIMPLY LICENSING IT,
THAT WOULD BE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM.
I DON'T LIKE THE PATH
THAT YOU'RE GOING DOWN.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
COSTCO IS
THE NUMBER-ONE BUYER
AND RE-SELLER OF WINE
ON EARTH, PERIOD.
EVERYTHING ABOUT
SELLING WINE IN AMERICA
IS KNOWN
BY THEIR BUYING TEAM.
WHICH BRANDS?
WHICH VARIETALS?
WHAT PRICE POINT?
WHAT PACKAGING? EVERYTHING.
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING.
EVERYTHING.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
THEY DON'T LIKE
THIS PRICE.
IF I TEAM UP WITH YOU,
I CAN GET THIS INTO COSTCO.
BUT NOT AT THAT PRICE.
YOU WANT TO DO $12 MILLION
OPENING ORDER
FROM CALIFORNIA ALONE?
IT'S $1.49.
YOU WANT TO DO A $19 MILLION
A YEAR BUSINESS WITH COSTCO?
IT'S $1.49.
I CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.
I CAN GET YOU IN COSTCO.
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
KEVIN IS ANDREW'S LAST CHANCE
FOR A DEAL
FOR HIS SINGLE-SERVE
WINE COMPANY, ZIPZ.
O'Leary: SO, HOW DO YOU GET
THE PRICE DOWN
SO THAT WE CAN SELL
TO COSTCO FOR $1.06?
HOW DO WE DO THAT?
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
THE PACKAGING DOWN.
AND, LIKE ANYTHING,
WHEN IT GOES TO SCALE,
WE FEEL WE CAN KEEP
DRIVING IT DOWN.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
HERE'S THE ONLY WAY
I'M DOING YOUR DEAL.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN GOING DOWN
THE PATH YOU'RE GOING DOWN,
TRYING TO PROVE OUT
A $2.99 PRODUCT
'CAUSE I KNOW
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
I'M TWO YEARS AHEAD
OF YOU, OKAY?
I WANT TO GO LAUNCH IT
IN COSTCO.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE VALUE OF THE OFFER
OF GETTING INTO COSTCO?
ABSOLUTELY.
John: OKAY.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I'LL GIVE YOU
$2.5 MILLION FOR 10%.
BUT I WANT THE OPTION
TO BUY ANOTHER $2.5 MILLION
WORTH OF EQUITY
AT EXACTLY
A $25 MILLION VALUATION
IN THE EVENT OF AN EXIT.
WHICH MEANS IF YOU SELL
THE COMPANY FOR $50 MILLION,
I STILL GET TO BUY IN
AT $25 MILLION.
YOU GET IT?
I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME UPSIDE
FOR MAKING YOUR COMPANY SO
VALUABLE THAT YOU CAN SELL IT.
AND OF COURSE,
ALL OF THIS ONLY HAPPENS
IF WE GET INTO COSTCO.
SO, YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT?
YES, I DO.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE A QUICK PHONE CALL...
YES.
...TO CHECK WITH THE INVESTORS.
ALL RIGHT.
[ SIGHS ] THESE WINE GUYS
DRIVE ME CRAZY.
I THINK THEY'RE NUTS
NOT TO DO YOUR DEAL.
IT'S JUST A POTENTIAL DEAL
WITH KEVIN.
SCOTT: Kevin only?
KEVIN ONLY.
Okay.
FOR 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN THE COMPANY.
AND HERE'S THE TWIST
AND THE KICKER.
SO, OBVIOUSLY,
WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS.
DO YOU SEE THIS AS YOUR WAY
OF YOU GETTING IN TO COSTCO?
YEAH.
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU WANT TO DO IT.
Herjavec: YEAH, BUT THIS
IS THE BEST OFFER
KEVIN'S EVER MADE
TO SOMEBODY.
OKAY. SO, IN SPEAKING TO THE
PARTNERS, THEY WERE INTRIGUED.
IT WASN'T THE ANGLE THEY THOUGHT
THAT YOU WOULD BE COMING IN AT.
I DESERVE TO BUY STOCK
AT A $25 MILLION VALUATION,
ANDREW,
BECAUSE I BROUGHT COSTCO
TO THE TABLE.
BECAUSE WE GOT INTO COSTCO,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE WAY MORE VALUABLE.
YOUR PARTNERS KNOW THAT.
YOU SHOULD DO THIS DEAL.
YOU HAVE NO RISK.
JUST SAY YES.
[ CHUCKLES ]
TRUST ME.
ANDREW, IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY GOOD DEAL.
ANDREW, ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE MY DEAL OR NOT?
DON'T BE A FOOL.
I'M ON BOARD.
YAY!
ALL RIGHT.
CHEERS.
YAY! [ LAUGHS ]
Greiner: YAY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GRAB YOUR VERY EXPENSIVE
PLASTIC GLASS AND TOAST ME.
CHEERS.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WHOO!
[ SIGHS ]
HERE'S TO THAT BEING OVER.
Herjavec: CHEERS.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
McMurray: GOING IN TO THIS,
WE KNEW THAT KEVIN
WAS THE WINE GUY.
TO HAVE KEVIN O'LEARY,
MR. WONDERFUL,
PART OF OUR WINE PROJECT THAT
WE'RE DOING -- PRETTY EXCITED.
