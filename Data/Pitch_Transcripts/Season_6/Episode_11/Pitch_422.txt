HI. MY NAME IS LYDIA EVANS
FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
I'M SEEKING $125,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY,
SOAPS WASHES
&amp; GROOMING ESSENTIALS,
BETTER KNOWN BY THE FELLAS
AS S.W.A.G. ESSENTIALS.
AS A LICENSED ESTHETICIAN
WITH EIGHT YEARS IN DERMATOLOGY,
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PASSION
FOR SKINCARE.
ONE DAY, MY BROTHER, A BARBER
OF 15 YEARS, CALLED,
BEGGING ME TO MAKE A PRODUCT
FOR HIS CLIENTS
THANK YOU, LYDIA.
YES, SIR.
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, LYDIA.
OH, YES, MR. WONDERFUL.
HELLO, DAMON.
THANK YOU.
HOW YOU DOING?
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE MEETING YOU.
THANK YOU, LYDIA.
THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
I AM FORMULATING ONE
WITHOUT LOOFAH.
SO, THE LOOFAH'S IN HERE?
THE LOOFAH'S IN THERE.
WHAT'S LOOFAH?
IT'S A FORM OF SPONGE,
RIGHT?
IT'S CATEGORIZED AS A SPONGE.
O'Leary:
IT'S ACTUALLY A PLANT
FIRST USED BY THE ANCIENT ROMANS
IN THEIR BATHS...
OH, MY GOD.
YES.
...TO EXFOLIATE.
LYDIA?
YES?
I'M NOT 1,000 YEARS OLD
LIKE KEVIN.
YES.
SO, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT LOOFAH IS.
BUT WHAT ELSE IS IN HERE?
'CAUSE I SEE ALL KINDS
OF THINGS IN THE SOAP.
THERE'S -- WELL,
IT'S A PROPRIETARY PRODUCT,
SO I CAN'T DISCLOSE THAT TO YOU.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY SALES, LYDIA?
YES, SIR.
WE'RE LOOKING AT $54,500.
LYDIA, WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?
YOU KNOW --
THOSE RETAIL FOR $15, SIR.
O'Leary: LYDIA, WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU GET FUNDED
BY ONE
OF THE SHARKS TODAY?
YOU'RE MAKING THIS
ON YOUR KITCHEN TABLE.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SCALE
THIS BUSINESS
SO THAT YOU HAVE WORLD
DOMINATION OF LOOFAH SOAP?
THAT'S THE PLAN,
WORLD DOMINATION.
I'VE ALREADY RESEARCHED
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW
THAT I NEED
TO GET INTO A WAREHOUSE
Herjavec: LYDIA?
YES?
LYDIA, WHY HAVEN'T YOU
TAKEN IT
BEYOND YOUR BROTHER'S
BARBERSHOP IN HOUSTON?
UM, IT HAS GOTTEN
OUTSIDE OF HOUSTON
BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE
FROM MY WEBSITE.
WELL, ONLINE, RIGHT.
I GET THAT FROM ONLINE, RIGHT?
YES.
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD
JUST SEEM TO ME
THAT IT WOULD BE COMMON SENSE
TO SAY, "LOOK.
WHERE'S THE CLOSEST
BARBERSHOP?"
BUT THAT'S WHAT I NEED YOU FOR.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
LYDIA?
I'M NOT HERE TO GO DOOR TO DOOR
TO EVERY BARBERSHOP.
NO, I'LL GET THE WORK DONE.
MY RISK/REWARD FOR THE AMOUNT
OF WORK IT'S GOING TO TAKE
TO JUST GET YOU TO WHERE
YOU NEED TO BE TO SCALE...
MM-HMM.
...IT'S NOT WORTH MY TIME.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
DAMON?
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
John: MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE PRODUCT BEING GREAT,
YOU'RE GREAT.
OH, THANK YOU.
YOUR DECISIONS IN LIFE
WERE WHAT GOT YOU HERE,
WHICH IS GREAT.
BUT YOU'RE SMARTER THAN ME
IN THIS AREA.
SO, WE NEED EACH OTHER.
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME, DAMON?
NO, I WOULD BE OF LITTLE --
I WOULD BE OF LITTLE SERVICE
TO YOU IN THIS AREA.
I DON'T THINK THAT
I'M TOO SHABBY FOR A YEAR IN.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T SEE ANYTHING
IN A YEAR IN.
IT HAS CAUGHT FIRE.
I WOULD NOT BE
OF HELP TO YOU.
WITH THAT BEING SAID...
...I'M OUT.
BUT I AM GONNA GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER.
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN I WILL BE SINGLE.
[ Chuckling ] OH, MY GOD.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I LIKE LONG ROMANTIC WALKS
TO THE BANK.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.
[ LAUGHS ]
GREAT JOB, LYDIA.
YOU JUST GOT TO GET
TO THE NEXT STEP.
Evans: THEY LOVED MY PRODUCT,
AND THAT WAS EXCITING.
THAT'S REALLY
ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME.
DAMON, CALL ME!
[ LAUGHS ]
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A COUPLE
WITH A FASHIONABLE ALTERNATIVE
FOR COLLEGE SPORTS FANS.
HI.
I'M SHAWNNA.
