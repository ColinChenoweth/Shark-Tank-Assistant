HI. MY NAME IS LYDIA EVANS
FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
I'M SEEKING $125,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY,
SOAPS WASHES
&amp; GROOMING ESSENTIALS,
BETTER KNOWN BY THE FELLAS
AS S.W.A.G. ESSENTIALS.
AS A LICENSED ESTHETICIAN
WITH EIGHT YEARS IN DERMATOLOGY,
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PASSION
FOR SKINCARE.
ONE DAY, MY BROTHER, A BARBER
OF 15 YEARS, CALLED,
BEGGING ME TO MAKE A PRODUCT
FOR HIS CLIENTS
THAT SUFFER FROM RAZOR BURN
AND HAIR BUMPS,
ALSO KNOWN AS FOLLICULITIS.
FOLLICULITIS IS WHEN THE HAIR
GETS TRAPPED
BENEATH THE HAIR FOLLICLE,
BEGINS TO BREED BACTERIA...
EW.
...AND CAUSES THE SKIN
TO BECOME ITCHY AND IRRITATED.
IT'S REALLY, REALLY NASTY STUFF.
SO, I STARTED JOTTING DOWN
FORMULATIONS, AND VOILà,
THE S.W.A.G. BAR WAS BORN.
THE S.W.A.G. BARS WENT ON SALE,
AND IT WAS ON.
NOW WHEN THE GUYS
SEE ME AROUND TOWN,
ALL I HEAR IS, "HEY, SOAP LADY!
YOU GOT THE GOODS WITH YOU?"
"WELL, OF COURSE, I DO.
MEET ME AROUND BACK."
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE S.W.A.G. BAR
HAS A THREE-IN-ONE VERSATILITY
THAT ALLOWS A GUY TO CLEANSE,
EXFOLIATE, AND DISINFECT
THE SURFACE OF HIS SKIN
IN ONE EASY USE.
WITH YOUR HELP, THIS BAR
IS GONNA TAKE OFF LIKE A G5.
WHO'S GONNA FLY AIR S.W.A.G.
WITH ME?
BECAUSE TOGETHER,
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN UP.
I HAVE SOME SAMPLES FOR YOU.
BRING ON THE S.W.A.G.
THANK YOU, LYDIA.
YES, SIR.
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, LYDIA.
OH, YES, MR. WONDERFUL.
HELLO, DAMON.
THANK YOU.
HOW YOU DOING?
NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE MEETING YOU.
THANK YOU, LYDIA.
THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
I AM FORMULATING ONE
WITHOUT LOOFAH.
SO, THE LOOFAH'S IN HERE?
THE LOOFAH'S IN THERE.
WHAT'S LOOFAH?
IT'S A FORM OF SPONGE,
RIGHT?
IT'S CATEGORIZED AS A SPONGE.
O'Leary:
IT'S ACTUALLY A PLANT
FIRST USED BY THE ANCIENT ROMANS
IN THEIR BATHS...
OH, MY GOD.
YES.
...TO EXFOLIATE.
LYDIA?
YES?
I'M NOT 1,000 YEARS OLD
LIKE KEVIN.
YES.
SO, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT LOOFAH IS.
BUT WHAT ELSE IS IN HERE?
'CAUSE I SEE ALL KINDS
OF THINGS IN THE SOAP.
THERE'S -- WELL,
IT'S A PROPRIETARY PRODUCT,
SO I CAN'T DISCLOSE THAT TO YOU.
YOU TOOK THE LOOFAH
AND POURED THAT IN?
HAVE YOU PATENTED THAT?
I HAVE NOT PATENTED.
AND LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHY I HAVE NOT PATENTED.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO RELEASE
MY INGREDIENTS.
IT'S 63 DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS
THAT GO INTO THAT BAR.
63 THINGS IN HERE?
YES, SIR.
63 INGREDIENTS.
AND IT'S ALL NATURAL.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY SALES, LYDIA?
YES, SIR.
WE'RE LOOKING AT $54,500.
AND HOW HAVE YOU
SOLD THAT?
THROUGH MY BROTHER'S
BARBERSHOP AND THE WEBSITE.
HOW MUCH ON THE WEB?
HOW MUCH IN THE BARBER SHOP?
I WOULD SAY 75% WEB,
25% BARBERSHOP.
AND DO YOU MAKE THIS
FOR WOMEN?
I AM LOOKING INTO THAT BECAUSE
A LOT OF GUYS ARE SAYING
THAT THEIR GIRLFRIENDS
ARE USING IT
ON THEIR LEGS AND BIKINI AREAS,
AND IT'S REAL POPULAR
FOR THAT.
WELL --
LYDIA, WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?
YOU KNOW --
THOSE RETAIL FOR $15, SIR.
AND I HAVE A 75% MARGIN.
YOWZA.
WOW.
SHE'S TALKING DIRTY NOW.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU MAKE IT FOR?
I MAKE IT FOR $3.07.
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
WOW. ARE YOU
MAKING THIS YOURSELF?
YES, MA'AM, I AM.
I MAKE IT FROM MY HOME.
OH, YOU MAKE IT
IN YOUR HOME?
FROM YOUR HOME?
YES, SIR, I DO.
O'Leary: LYDIA, WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU GET FUNDED
BY ONE
OF THE SHARKS TODAY?
YOU'RE MAKING THIS
ON YOUR KITCHEN TABLE.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SCALE
THIS BUSINESS
SO THAT YOU HAVE WORLD
DOMINATION OF LOOFAH SOAP?
THAT'S THE PLAN,
WORLD DOMINATION.
I'VE ALREADY RESEARCHED
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW
THAT I NEED
TO GET INTO A WAREHOUSE
AND PRODUCE ON A LARGER LEVEL.
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU NEED?
LARGER EQUIPMENT.
RIGHT NOW, I'M DOING 20 GALLONS.
YOU CAN GET MELTERS FOR SOAP
UP TO 150 GALLONS.
John: THAT SOUNDS
TIME CONSUMING.
YES.
IS THIS YOUR ONLY JOB
AT THE MOMENT?
I'M AN ESTHETICIAN BY TRADE.
NOW, WHAT DOES YOUR HUS--
ARE YOU MARRIED?
I -- MNH-MNH.
NO, SIR.
OH.
WHOA, DAMON.
YOU KNOW SOME SINGLE GUYS?
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
OH, YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
NO, SIR.
I'M NOT MARRIED.
NO CHILDREN.
SO, THIS IS MY BABY.
IT'S MY BOYFRIEND, IT'S MY BEST
FRIEND, IT'S MY ROOMMATE.
Herjavec: LYDIA?
YES?
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW,
AND I KNOW WHAT I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT THE RIGHT PARTNER
FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A LOOFAH WAS.
I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.
THIS IS A VERY AWESOME PRODUCT.
VERY INNOVATIVE.
IT WILL BE THE VERY FIRST ONE
IN THE WORLD
TO COME TO THE MARKET
THE WAY IT IS.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT. I THINK
IT'S A VERY INNOVATIVE IDEA,
BUT REALLY A HOBBY AT THIS POINT
ON YOUR KITCHEN TABLE.
IF YOU ALREADY SET UP
MANUFACTURING,
YOU WERE TRYING TO POUR GASOLINE
ON THAT TO ACCELERATE IT,
THAT WOULD BE
MORE INTERESTING.
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF HURDLES
YOU'RE GONNA FACE.
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
WELL, I LOVE INNOVATION.
YOU TOOK TWO THINGS,
YOU PUT IT TOGETHER,
AND YOU'VE CREATED
A BETTER MOUSETRAP.
THANK YOU.
PROBLEM FOR ME IS,
IT'S ONE SKEW THAT ISN'T
TESTED OR PROVEN YET.
I'M OUT.
LYDIA, WHY HAVEN'T YOU
TAKEN IT
BEYOND YOUR BROTHER'S
BARBERSHOP IN HOUSTON?
UM, IT HAS GOTTEN
OUTSIDE OF HOUSTON
BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE
FROM MY WEBSITE.
WELL, ONLINE, RIGHT.
I GET THAT FROM ONLINE, RIGHT?
YES.
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD
JUST SEEM TO ME
THAT IT WOULD BE COMMON SENSE
TO SAY, "LOOK.
WHERE'S THE CLOSEST
BARBERSHOP?"
AND THEN JUST DRIVE THERE
AND SAY, "LOOK.
"IT WORKED
AT MY BROTHER'S SHOP.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT
A TRY?"
BUT THAT'S WHAT I NEED YOU FOR.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
LYDIA?
I'M NOT HERE TO GO DOOR TO DOOR
TO EVERY BARBERSHOP.
NO, I'LL GET THE WORK DONE.
MY RISK/REWARD FOR THE AMOUNT
OF WORK IT'S GOING TO TAKE
TO JUST GET YOU TO WHERE
YOU NEED TO BE TO SCALE...
MM-HMM.
...IT'S NOT WORTH MY TIME.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
DAMON?
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
John: MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE PRODUCT BEING GREAT,
YOU'RE GREAT.
OH, THANK YOU.
YOUR DECISIONS IN LIFE
WERE WHAT GOT YOU HERE,
WHICH IS GREAT.
BUT YOU'RE SMARTER THAN ME
IN THIS AREA.
SO, WE NEED EACH OTHER.
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME, DAMON?
NO, I WOULD BE OF LITTLE --
I WOULD BE OF LITTLE SERVICE
TO YOU IN THIS AREA.
I DON'T THINK THAT
I'M TOO SHABBY FOR A YEAR IN.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T SEE ANYTHING
IN A YEAR IN.
IT HAS CAUGHT FIRE.
I WOULD NOT BE
OF HELP TO YOU.
WITH THAT BEING SAID...
...I'M OUT.
BUT I AM GONNA GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER.
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN I WILL BE SINGLE.
[ Chuckling ] OH, MY GOD.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I LIKE LONG ROMANTIC WALKS
TO THE BANK.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.
[ LAUGHS ]
GREAT JOB, LYDIA.
YOU JUST GOT TO GET
TO THE NEXT STEP.
DO I HAVE TO TURN AROUND
AND WALK OUT?
YES, YOU DO.
O'Leary: YEAH.
WAY TOO EARLY.
Greiner: WAY TOO EARLY.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME IN
AND DO ALL OF HER ACCOUNTING.
BUT IT'S A VERY SMART IDEA.
Evans: THEY LOVED MY PRODUCT,
AND THAT WAS EXCITING.
THAT'S REALLY
ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME.
DAMON, CALL ME!
[ LAUGHS ]
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A COUPLE
WITH A FASHIONABLE ALTERNATIVE
FOR COLLEGE SPORTS FANS.
HI.
I'M SHAWNNA.
