MY NAME IS TRINA BARKOURAS.
I'M FROM CORONA DEL MAR,
CALIFORNIA,
HI, SHARKS.
I'M TRINA BARKOURAS.
TRINA, YOU'RE GONNA PAY $2
TO MAKE IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SELL IT FOR?
$7.99.
O'Leary: TRINA...
...JUST A SERIOUS QUESTION,
BECAUSE I AM MR. WONDERFUL,
THIS IS MY TRADE-SHOW BOOTH.
TRINA, TRINA, LOOK.
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO CALL YOURSELF TRINA ANYMORE.
I HAVE RECHRISTENED YOU
"THE BEAST,"
BECAUSE YOU ARE A BEAST.
TRINA, HERE-- HERE'S -- HERE'S
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOUR PITCH --
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WE ALL MEET
AROUND THE COUNTRY,
SAY, "I WANT TO
GET ON 'SHARK TANK' ONE DAY."
YOU KNOW, TRINA,
I-I-I ALWAYS SAY
I CAN TELL INSTANTLY
IF IT'S A HERO OR A ZERO.
OKAY, TRINA, LET ME HELP YOU.
LET ME HELP YOU.
OKAY.
I AM WILLING TO DO THIS,
BECAUSE I THINK I SHOULD HAVE
A WOMAN WITH HORNS
IN MY PORTFOLIO.
OH, NO!
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
O'Leary:
LET ME HELP YOU.
I AM WILLING TO DO THIS
BECAUSE I THINK I SHOULD HAVE
A WOMAN WITH HORNS
IN MY PORTFOLIO.
I'M GOING TO PUT
THE FIRST $5,000 UP,
OKAY,
AGAINST THE $50,000 ASK.
I WILL PARTNER WITH ANY OTHER
SHARK OR SHARK-ETTE.
I'LL MATCH THAT.
I'LL DO ANOTHER $5,000.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU GOT -- YOU GOT $10,000.
YOU GOT $10,000.
ALL RIGHT! I LIKE IT!
I'M IN! $5,000.
WAIT.
CRAZY IS GOOD, BUT --
TRINA, TRINA, TRINA --
OKAY, ENOUGH.
IS THE AIRSTREAM
PART OF THE BUSINESS?
