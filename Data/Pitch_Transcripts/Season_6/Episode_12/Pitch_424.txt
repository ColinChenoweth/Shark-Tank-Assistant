MY NAME IS TRINA BARKOURAS.
I'M FROM CORONA DEL MAR,
CALIFORNIA,
AND I'M THE CREATOR
OF HOPPY PAWS.
MY CHILDHOOD WAS DIFFICULT,
TO SAY THE LEAST.
MY PARENTS SPLIT UP
WHEN MY BROTHERS AND I
WERE AT A VERY YOUNG AGE,
AND WE WERE LEFT
TO FEND FOR OURSELVES.
BUT IT WAS A POSITIVE THING.
IT GAVE ME THE TENACITY
AND STRENGTH
TO FIGHT FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE.
BECAUSE MY CHILDHOOD
WAS SO DIFFICULT,
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
I DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE MY KIDS FEEL LOVED.
I DECIDED I WANT
MY CHILDREN'S HOLIDAYS
TO BE EXTRA SPECIAL.
SO I CAME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA
THAT GOT THEM REALLY EXCITED.
IT BECAME A FAMILY TRADITION,
AND NOW I'VE DECIDED
TO TURN IT INTO A BUSINESS.
RECENTLY, I GOT SEPARATED,
AND I FOUND MYSELF
ON MY OWN AGAIN.
I LOOK AT CHALLENGES IN LIFE
AS AN OPPORTUNITY.
YOU CAN EITHER WALLOW,
OR YOU CAN GO OUT AND SUCCEED.
GETTING A DEAL
WITH ONE OF THE SHARKS
WOULD MEAN I CAN SHARE
MY FAMILY'S TRADITION
WITH MILLIONS OF FAMILIES
EVERYWHERE.
HI, SHARKS.
I'M TRINA BARKOURAS.
I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS HOPPY PAWS.
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING $50,000
FOR A 10% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
I'VE CREATED
HOPPY PAWS STAMPING KITS
AS A SAFE, SIMPLE,
AND INEXPENSIVE WAY
TO DELIGHT CHILDREN EVERYWHERE
WITH PROOF OF A VISIT
BY SANTA AND HIS REINDEER,
AND MANY, MANY MORE.
SO, SHARKS, LET'S GET YOU
INTO THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT.
'TWAS THE NIGHT
BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
KIDS ARE SNUGGLED IN BED.
TIME TO PREP FOR ST. NICK.
I HAVE NOTHING TO DREAD.
I GRIN TO MYSELF
LIKE A JOLLY OLD ELF
JUST ADD WATER AND STAMP,
BUY THEM RIGHT OFF THE SHELF
IN THE MORNING,
I'LL WAKE TO SQUEALS OF DELIGHT
HOPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL,
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.
NOW, WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
WANTS TO SHARE
MY FAMILY TRADITION
AND HOP ALL THE WAY
TO THE BANK WITH ME?
WHAT'S THE PRODUCT?
IT'S AN -- ACTUALLY,
IT'S A STAMPING KIT.
ISN'T THIS WHAT WE USED TO SEE
FOR EASTER FOR --
IS THIS THE SAME BRAND
THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS?
NO, BUT I HAVE
SOME SAMPLES FOR YOU.
Greiner:
FOR PAINTING EGGS, YOU MEAN?
LIKE, THOSE -- YEAH.
YEAH.
IT HAS A SIMILAR LOOK TO THE
EGG-PAINTING KIT, DOESN'T IT?
IT HAS A SIMILAR FEEL,
MM-HMM.
HERE YOU GO, ROBERT.
THANK YOU.
HERE YOU GO, LORI.
THANK YOU.
MR. WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO, MY STAMPING KITS
ARE COMPRISED, AS YOU CAN SEE,
OF A BOX,
A THERMOFORM TRAY...
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.
...POWDER
THAT'S MIXED WITH WATER.
SIMPLY DIP THE STAMP
INTO THE TRAY AND STAMP AWAY.
Corcoran:
WHAT IS IT -- FLOUR?
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY
SUPER-SECRET POWDER.
IT'S A FOOD-GRADE PRODUCT.
DO I JUST WASH IT OFF
WHEN I'M DONE WITH IT?
IT'S ACTUALLY BIODEGRADABLE.
CLEANS UP WITH WATER.
Greiner: SO, YOU COULD DO IT
ON CARPETING?
YOU COULD DO IT ON CARPETING
AND VACUUM IT UP.
AND, SO,
IT'S A SEASONAL PRODUCT.
YOU SELL IT IN ONCE,
AND THEN IT'S DONE.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I HAVE THE EASTER BUNNY,
SO WE'D MAKE A LITTLE TRAIL
THAT GOES TO THE CHILD'S EASTER
BASKET, AND THEN AN ELF --
I GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE NEXT ONE?
THIS IS THE TOOTH FAIRY.
CHILDREN LOSE 20 TEETH.
NOW, YOU'RE STRETCHING
ON THAT ONE.
WHAT'S YOUR BEST SELLER?
MY BEST SELLER?
UM, WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING
RIGHT THERE IN YOUR HAND,
THAT BOX CAME OFF THE PRESS
YESTERDAY.
SO YOU'RE JUST STARTING
TO SELL ALL THIS NOW?
THIS IS A STARTUP.
OHH!
OHH!
OHH, OKAY!
OHH!
SO WE CAN'T REALLY ASK YOU
WHAT'S THE MOST POPULAR,
BECAUSE
YOU'RE JUST FINDING OUT.
CORRECT. 90 DAYS AGO,
I WENT TO SAN DIEGO WITH AN IDEA
AND A VERY ROUGH PROTOTYPE.
WAIT, WAIT. 90 --
THIS ALL STARTED 90 DAYS AGO?
90 DAYS AGO. SO --
SERIOUSLY?
YES.
I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
20 YEARS AGO
WHEN MY KIDS WERE LITTLE.
I WOULD GO THROUGH
THIS HOUR-LONG PROCESS
AT NIGHT BEFORE EASTER.
SO, PEOPLE WOULD COME BY
IN THE MORNING,
'CAUSE I'D HAVE THE TRAILS GOING
UP MY WALK, AND THEY'D SAY,
"WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
I WANT THAT FOR <i>MY</i> KIDS."
WELL, WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
IS, THOUGH,
IN THAT FAST OF A TIME,
YOU CREATED YOUR PACKAGING.
YOU CREATED YOUR PRODUCT.
I MEAN, YOU DID A DISPLAY.
I'M A GO-GETTER.
THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.
I'M A SURVIVOR.
YOU DESERVE
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT.
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN
SINCE I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.
MY MOTHER HAD ME EMANCIPATED.
SHE WALKED INTO A COURT OF LAW
AND SAID,
"I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL
ANY LONGER."
I WENT TO TACO BELL AND MADE
BURRITOS FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
TILL I GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
I MOVED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
WITH $300, IN MY CAR,
AND HERE I AM TODAY.
I'VE SOLD HOMES
FOR $4 MILLION.
I'M AN INTERIOR DESIGNER.
AND I'M VERY SUCCESSFUL
AT EVERYTHING THAT I DO.
I KNOW THIS IS A GOOD IDEA,
AND I KNOW IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
BUT IF YOU'RE SO SUCCESSFUL
AT ALL THOSE THINGS,
HOW DO YOU EVEN
HAVE TIME --
BECAUSE I QUIT ALL OF THAT
TO DO THIS.
YOU QUIT ALL THAT FOR --
THIS IS WHAT I DO FULL-TIME.
WHOA.
Herjavec: NO, YOU DID NOT.
YES, I DID.
I BELIEVE YOU.
I BELIEVE THAT.
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SELL THIS FOR?
OKAY. RIGHT NOW,
ON MY FIRST PRODUCTION RUN,
IT COST ME $2 TO MAKE.
AND THE REASON
I WANT THE $50,000
IS BECAUSE I NEED TO INCREASE
MY PRODUCTION TO 50,000 UNITS
SO I CAN GET IT DOWN
TO UNDER $1.
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SELL IT FOR?
Herjavec: OH,
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT
AND SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY
ON INVENTORY
BEFORE YOU HAVE SOME ORDERS.
UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING
TO SELL DOOR-TO-DOOR.
OR UNLESS YOU HAVE A PURCHASE
ORDER WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M COMPLETELY
FARMING AT MICHAELS RIGHT NOW.
I'M GOING
FOR WALGREENS, WALMART.
WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU?
WHAT DO THEY TELL ME?
I HAVEN'T --
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME ANYTHING.
THAT BOX THAT YOU'RE HOLDING
IN YOUR HAND...
YEAH.
...I PICKED THAT UP
AT 5:00 YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
SO WE DON'T KNOW
IF ANY OF THIS IS GONNA SELL.
HEY, AMEN FOR HUSTLE,
BOY. AMEN.
TRINA, YOU'RE GONNA PAY $2
TO MAKE IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SELL IT FOR?
$7.99.
O'Leary: TRINA...
...JUST A SERIOUS QUESTION,
BECAUSE I AM MR. WONDERFUL,
AND I CARE
ABOUT BARBARA'S MONEY.
OKAY. [ CHUCKLES ]
WHY DO YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH $500,000?
'CAUSE YOU'RE TELLING ME
I GET 10% FOR $50,000,
ASSUMING A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR
VALUE.
YOU'VE SOLD NOTHING.
I DON'T WANT HER
TO PUT HER MONEY TO WASTE.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
YOU'RE BUYING THIS.
I SWEAR YOU'RE BUYING THIS.
SO, WHY IS WORTH
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS?
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU,
MR. WONDERFUL.
I HAVE $105,000
INVESTED IN THIS COMPANY.
IN 90 DAYS?
I KNOW I'M GOING --
IN 90 DAYS.
IN WHAT?
UM, ALL
OF THE GRAPHIC DESIGN,
THE TOOLING FOR THE TRAYS,
THE TOOLING AND THE DIES
TO CUT THE FOAM,
ALL OF THE PRINTING --
Cuban: YOU ARE A MACHINE.
I GIVE YOU CREDIT.
THANK YOU.
I MEAN,
YOU ARE A MACHINE.
THE TRAILER ITSELF --
ALL OF IT.
YOU OWN THE TRAILER, TOO?
YOU OWN THE TRAILER?
YOU BOUGHT THE TRAILER?
THIS IS MY TRADE-SHOW BOOTH.
OH!
WOW!
THIS IS MY TRADE-SHOW BOOTH.
TRINA, TRINA, LOOK.
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO CALL YOURSELF TRINA ANYMORE.
I HAVE RECHRISTENED YOU
"THE BEAST,"
BECAUSE YOU ARE A BEAST.
GRR!
AND I LOVE IT,
AND I WISH MY SALESPEOPLE
WERE ARE FOCUSED AND AS DRIVEN
AND AS EXCITED
ABOUT THEIR VISION.
AND AS CRAZY.
I'M A GO-GETTER.
PEOPLE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.
TRINA, HERE-- HERE'S -- HERE'S
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOUR PITCH --
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WE ALL MEET
AROUND THE COUNTRY,
SAY, "I WANT TO
GET ON 'SHARK TANK' ONE DAY."
AND I SAY TO THEM, "WHY DON'T
YOU -- WHY DON'T YOU APPLY?"
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY?
"OH, I'M NOT READY.
I'M GONNA GIVE MYSELF A COUPLE
OF YEARS. I'M GONNA GET READY."
HOW OFTEN
DOES THAT HAPPEN TO YOU?
ALL THE TIME.
ALL THE TIME.
AND HERE YOU ARE -- YOU DIDN'T
EVEN HAVE <i>ANYTHING</i> 90 DAYS AGO,
AND -- BANG --
HERE YOU ARE WITH A BUSINESS.
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A GOOD IDEA,
AND I KNOW PEOPLE WILL BUY IT.
THAT'S THE GOOD PART.
THAT'S THE GOOD PART.
HERE'S THE BAD PART.
[ CHUCKLES ] NO.
YOU DON'T KNOW
IF PEOPLE ARE GONNA BUY IT.
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE CONFUSING -- I
DON'T MEAN THIS IN A BAD WAY --
A FAMILY TRADITION THAT YOUR
KIDS LIKE WITH A GENERAL MARKET.
MY OPINION IS THAT MY KIDS
WOULDN'T GET SUPER EXCITED
WITH PRINTS ON THE GROUND.
THEY'D SAY, "DADDY,
WHY IS THE CARPET DIRTY?"
UM,
THERE ARE NO SALES TODAY.
CORRECT.
MY OPINION --
I HAVE ONE SALE THREE DAYS AGO.
I WALKED IN COLD.
MY OPINION IS,
KIDS AREN'T GONNA LIKE IT.
THAT'S SIMPLY MY OPINION.
I MIGHT BE WRONG.
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
YOU KNOW, TRINA,
I-I-I ALWAYS SAY
I CAN TELL INSTANTLY
IF IT'S A HERO OR A ZERO.
AND...?
I THINK <i>YOU'RE</i> THE HERO.
THANK YOU.
I MEAN, WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS AMAZING.
THANK YOU.
MY CONCERN IS, UM, TO MARK'S
POINT ABOUT THE SIMILARITY
TO THE OTHER PRODUCT
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO, LORI.
I WISH YOU COULD SEE
AN EASTER-EGG-DECORATING KIT.
IT MAY RING A BELL FOR YOU, BUT
THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
I HAVE MY TRADEMARK PENDING.
I HAVE MY PATENT PENDING.
I'VE DONE MY HOMEWORK
IN 90 DAYS.
I DON'T SLEEP, OKAY?
I'M A CREATIVE MIND ON CRACK.
[ Chuckling ]
I BELIEVE THAT.
THESE TWO PRODUCTS
THAT I HAVE FOR HALLOWEEN,
THEY GLOW IN THE DARK
AT NIGHT.
I THINK THAT'S VERY CLEVER.
MY LITTLE LEPRECHAUN'S
GONNA COME
WITH A LITTLE GREEN VIAL OF DYE
THAT YOU POUR IN THE TOILET
SO YOU KNOW
THAT THE LEPRECHAUN WAS THERE.
KIDS GO CRAZY.
THAT HE PEED IN THE TOILET?
SIX -- YES!
[ LAUGHTER ]
HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THAT,
BARBARA?
YOU COULD BE --
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THAT?
I'M IRISH.
I NEVER HEARD OF IT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY FUNNY,
BECAUSE YOU FASCINATE ME.
I MEAN, I--I'M SITTING HERE
A LITTLE BIT MESMERIZED BY TH--
I DON'T KNOW IF --
I'M SO INTO MY KIDS,
AND I DO EVERYTHING
TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
PEOPLE COME TO ME,
AND THEY SAY,
"WHERE CAN I GET THIS?"
OKAY, TRINA, LET ME HELP YOU.
LET ME HELP YOU.
OKAY.
I AM WILLING TO DO THIS,
BECAUSE I THINK I SHOULD HAVE
A WOMAN WITH HORNS
IN MY PORTFOLIO.
OH, NO!
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
O'Leary:
LET ME HELP YOU.
I AM WILLING TO DO THIS
BECAUSE I THINK I SHOULD HAVE
A WOMAN WITH HORNS
IN MY PORTFOLIO.
I'M GOING TO PUT
THE FIRST $5,000 UP,
OKAY,
AGAINST THE $50,000 ASK.
I WILL PARTNER WITH ANY OTHER
SHARK OR SHARK-ETTE.
I'LL MATCH THAT.
I'LL DO ANOTHER $5,000.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU GOT -- YOU GOT $10,000.
YOU GOT $10,000.
ALL RIGHT! I LIKE IT!
I'M IN! $5,000.
WAIT.
AND IF YOU AND I EACH
GIVE ANOTHER $5,000...
NO, NO, YOU GOT TO
GET TO $50,000.
...SHE'S GONNA BE
HALFWAY THERE.
WE NEED 50% OF THE COMPANY --
50%.
HOW ARE WE
GONNA GET THERE?
NO, I DON'T NEED
50% OF THE COMPANY.
OKAY, 49.9%.
I PUT $105,000 INTO THIS
IN 90 DAYS. LOOK WHERE I AM.
SHE'S ALREADY GOT
$100,000 INTO IT.
I'M UP FOR $5,000.
THAT'S ALL I'M GIVING.
CRAZY IS GOOD, BUT --
TRINA, TRINA, TRINA --
OKAY, ENOUGH.
IS THE AIRSTREAM
PART OF THE BUSINESS?
YES, IT IS.
IT'S IN MY COMPANY.
AND IT'S PAID FOR IN CASH?
EVERYTHING IN MY BUSINESS
IS PAID FOR IN CASH.
I DON'T PAY MYSELF.
I HAVE NO DEBT.
I HAVE NO OTHER INVESTORS.
I OWN 100% OF MY COMPANY.
OKAY, WOULD YOU CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIMITING YOUR SKUs?
YOU HAVE EIGHT SKUs HERE.
I BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE
THAT ARE GOOD SELLERS...
OKAY.
...EASTER BUNNY,
SANTA'S REINDEER, AND
TOOTH FAIRY TO START OFF WITH.
YES. I WOULD, BARBARA.
OKAY.
BECAUSE IT WOULD CHANGE
THE SIZE OF YOUR DISPLAY,
WHICH WOULD BE
AN ENORMOUS ADVANTAGE
IN SOME OF
THE BIG-BOX STORES.
I HAVE, MY ENTIRE LIFE,
DONE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
FOR MY KIDS.
I WOULD TAKE A SPRAY BOTTLE,
OKAY?
I WOULD SPRAY THE FLOOR --
TWO LITTLE DOTS,
THEY DIDN'T LOOK AS GOOD
AS THIS -- AND SPRINKLE IT.
CAN I TELL YOU?
I HAD THE ADVANTAGE
OF WATCHING MY SON RESPOND TO IT
AND NOW
MY 8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.
THEY GO CRAZY! THEY FOLLOW THE
TRACKS. THEY CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S, LIKE, PROOF
THAT SANTA CLAUS EXISTS.
I TOTALLY KNOW
THIS THING WORKS,
AND YOU'VE DONE IT
SO MUCH BETTER.
SO, I WANT
50% OF YOUR BUSINESS...
FOR $100,000.
BA-BAM.
SO, BASICALLY, YOU BOTH PUT IN
THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.
Corcoran:
I'D LIKE TO BE ON EQUAL FOOTING,
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY.
OKAY.
BECAUSE I'M GONNA WORK
JUST AS HARD AS YOU.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER, IF I DO GET
LARGE PURCHASE ORDERS,
HELPING ME FIND
A LINE OF CREDIT?
OH, NO PROBLEM. I'LL GIVE YOU
THE LINE OF CREDIT.
OKAY.
PURCHASE ORDERS,
I LOVE TO FUND.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
49% AND 51%?
AS LONG AS <i>YOU</i> CONSIDER
[CHUCKLES]
THAT IF YOU
GET TIRED OF THIS,
THAT YOU THINK
OF YOUR NEXT FIVE IDEAS,
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LITTLE MACHINE
OF IDEAS.
Cuban: SHE'S THE BEAST.
I HAVE TWO MORE.
YOU'RE THE BEAST.
[ Chuckling ] YOU'RE THE BEAST.
AND ALL THOSE IDEAS
ARE <i>OUR</i> IDEAS GOING FORWARD.
OKAY. WE'RE EQUAL PARTNERS
ON THOSE NEW IDEAS.
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
YOU GOT IT. I LOVE IT.
YOU GET 51% NOW. I GET 49%.
I GIVE YOU $100,000,
BUT ON ALL FUTURE IDEAS,
WE'RE 50/50.
OKAY, GREAT.
YEAH.
I'M SO EXCITED. YES!
Cuban: THE BEAST! THE BEAST!
Herjavec: WHOO!
CONGRATULATIONS.
HA HA! THANK YOU.
KEVIN, YOU WERE RIGHT.
THIS <i>WAS</i> A BARBARA DEAL.
I KNEW IT,
AND I'M SO PROUD TO HELP HER.
Greiner: YOU WERE RIGHT
FROM THE BEGINNING.
I KNOW SHE'LL GIVE ME
MY 10% FOR FREE.
BYE, GUYS. THANK YOU.
Cuban: CONGRATS.
Greiner: CONGRATULATIONS.
I HAVE BARBARA ON MY TEAM NOW.
I'M SO EXCITED!
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M SO EXCITED.
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED.
TOMORROW'S THE FIRST DAY
OF THE REST OF MY LIFE.
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS GONNA BUY THAT DEAL?
'CAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY.
IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
