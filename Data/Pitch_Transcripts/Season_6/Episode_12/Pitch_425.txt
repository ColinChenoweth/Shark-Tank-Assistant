MY NAME'S NEAL HOFFMAN
FROM CINCINNATI, OHIO,
AND I'M HERE ASKING FOR $150,000
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
NOW, SHARKS,
THINK ABOUT THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
THE SMELL OF CHRISTMAS TREES
IS IN THE AIR,
YOU HEAR "JINGLE BELLS"
PLAYING ON THE RADIO,
AND YOU'RE LITERALLY
COUNTING DOWN THE DAYS
UNTIL SANTA
COMES TO YOUR HOUSE.
IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL,
DOESN'T IT?
AND IT IS...
UNLESS YOU'RE JEWISH.
[ CHUCKLES ]
CHRISTMASTIME IS THE HARDEST
TIME TO BE A JEWISH CHILD.
BUT JUST BECAUSE OUR RELIGION'S
OVER 5,000 YEARS OLD
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T ADD
SOME MORE "FUNUKKAH"
TO HANUKKAH.
INTRODUCING
THE MENSCH ON A BENCH.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
OH, LORD.
THE MENSCH ON A BENCH IS
THE NEW JEWISH FAMILY TRADITION,
DESIGNED TO BRING MORE FUN AND
MORE MEMORIES TO YOUR HOUSEHOLD.
EVERY MENSCH ON A BENCH PACKAGE
COMES WITH A 12-INCH MENSCH,
HIS VERY OWN BENCH,
AND A HARDCOVER BOOK THAT TELLS
THE STORY OF MOSHE THE MENSCH.
A MENSCH IS A DO-GOODER.
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN
TO GROW UP TO BE.
AND THE MENSCH ON A BENCH
WOULD BECOME THE CENTERPIECE
OF YOUR HOLIDAY TRADITION.
IT WILL WATCH OVER
YOUR MENORAH
AND HOLD YOUR SHAMMASH,
OR YOUR LEADER CANDLE.
NOW, SHARKS, I UNDERSTAND
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLACES
YOU COULD PUT YOUR MONEY
THIS HOLIDAY SEASON,
BUT NONE OF THEM HOLD A CANDLE
TO THE MENSCH ON A BENCH.
SO, WHO WANTS TO "GELT" TOGETHER
AND MAKE SOME MENSCHES?
WELL, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
SO, I AM PART
OF AN INTERFAITH MARRIAGE,
AND WE GO THROUGH
THE DECEMBER DILEMMA EVERY YEAR.
WE'RE RAISING THE BOYS
JEWISH.
AND WE WERE
WALKING THROUGH A STORE,
AND MY SON ASKED
FOR AN ELF ON A SHELF,
AND I SAID, "DUDE, WE'RE JEWS.
WE DON'T DO ELVES ON SHELVES."
"DUDE."
OKAY?
WE DO MENSCHES ON BENCHES.
AND THE IDEA JUST HIT ME
LIKE -- LIKE LIGHTNING.
SO I WENT BACK,
I WROTE THE STORY OF,
WHY WOULD YOU NEED THE MENSCH?
AND EACH NIGHT IN THE STORY,
WE INTRODUCE
A DIFFERENT JEWISH TRADITION.
SO, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY
IS REALLY BEHIND THIS.
IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL.
CAN I SEE THE PACKAGING?
I DON'T WANT TO SELL
A SEASONAL PRODUCT.
I WANT TO SELL
A SEASONAL BRAND.
AND I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOURS,
KEVIN.
AND I KNOW
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU HATE.
YOU HATE INVENTORY.
HE HATES EVERYTHING, NEAL.
O'Leary: BUT, NEAL, YOU KNOW
THERE'S AN INVENTORY ISSUE,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE PRODUCT THERE FOR THOSE
THAT WANT TO BUY IT, BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO GUESSTIMATE RIGHT
HOW MANY ARE GOING
TO BE THERE TO BUY IT.
SO, WHAT I'VE DONE
WITH THE RETAILERS THIS YEAR IS,
THEY ARE BUYING IT
F.O.B. CHINA,
SO THE RETAILERS TAKE POSSESSION
OF ALL THE INVENTORY.
WE'RE NOT TAKING THE RISK
ON THE INVENTORY.
WELL, TELL US
ABOUT SALES LAST YEAR
VERSUS WHO'S GONNA PLAY WITH YOU
THIS YEAR.
SURE.
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF.
I'M A FORMER
HASBRO TOY EXECUTIVE.
OOH.
I'M NOT JUST A CRAZY JEWISH GUY
COMING OUT HERE.
SO, YOU'RE STILL WORKING?
PART-TIME.
I WORK THREE DAYS A WEEK.
I DO TWO DAYS ON MENSCH.
I'M READY,
IF I GET A DEAL TODAY,
TO QUIT MY JOB
AND DO THIS FULL TIME.
SO, WE CREATED IT,
RAISED $22,000 ON KICKSTARTER,
AND I TOLD MY WIFE,
"LET'S MAKE 1,000."
SO, I SOLD
MY FULL 1,000 I MADE,
AND THEN SOLD ANOTHER PRE-ORDERS
FOR ANOTHER 1,000 LAST YEAR.
NEAL, WHAT DID YOU SELL THEM
FOR? WHAT DO THEY COST?
THEY COST $7.45 TO MAKE.
WHAT DO THE RETAILERS
SELL THEM FOR?
THE BIG-BOX
WILL BE OUT AT $29.99,
AND THE SPECIALTY
WILL BE AT $34.99.
THIS YEAR, WE WILL BE
IN BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,
TARGET, BARNES &amp; NOBLES,
MICHAELS, TOYS "R" US.
WE ARE GOING TO DO $930,000
IN SALES THIS YEAR
ON 60,000 UNITS.
SO WE ANTICIPATE
MAKING $250,000 IN PROFIT.
CAN WE SEE THE BOOK
THAT'S INSIDE THE PACKAGE, NEAL?
Greiner: [ Laughing ]
HE NEEDS TO BE GOOD-LOOKING.
O'Leary: HE IS A SCARY-LOOKING
GUY, I GOT TO TELL YOU.
Corcoran:
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
HE'S NOT A FUN-LOOKING GUY.
COULD HE HAVE A SON?
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE SANTA'S
A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.
YOU TAKE HIM OUT OF THE PACKAGE,
AND HE IS ON HIS BENCH ALREADY.
Hoffman: ABSOLUTELY.
O'Leary: SO -- SO, NEAL,
YOU'RE ASKING FOR A VALUE,
FROM ME AS A SHARK,
THAT ANTICIPATES
YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL GOING
BEYOND MENSCH ON A BENCH SKU,
THAT SOMEHOW
IT'S GOING TO GROW INTO A BRAND.
AND I THINK
THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING
A LITTLE CHALLENGE
WITH THE LEAP OF FAITH.
SO, EVEN -- EVEN IF WE JUST GROW
THE MENSCH ON A BENCH BRAND
AND WE DRIVE DOWN
THE COST OF GOODS 10%,
WE CAN MAKE $500,000
IN PROFIT NEXT YEAR.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE
$150,000 TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING?
I THINK, FOR NEXT YEAR,
DEVELOPING AN APP.
AN APP?
HAVE YOU SEEN ELF YOURSELF, THE
APP WHERE YOU PUT YOUR FACE --
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED THAT
SPENDS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
ON THAT.
I KNOW THE GUYS
BEHIND THAT.
I GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
IS THAT YOU JUST WANT TO USE
THE MONEY FOR MARKETING.
WELL, I THINK THE MARKETING
IS TAKING CARE OF ITSELF.
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS FIGURE OUT
WAYS TO EXPAND THE I.P.
THERE'S NOT AN I.P.
IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.
THERE'S FROSTY,
THERE'S RUDOLPH, THERE'S ELVES,
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO DEVELOP, BECAUSE I --
O'Leary: NEAL, IT SEEMS YOU WANT
TO TAKE YOUR POTENTIAL $250,000
TO $500,000 IN PROFIT
AND PUT IT INTO
A WHOLE BUNCH OF ENTERPRISES
THAT MAY NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR
THE METRICS OF SUCCESS
THAT THIS THING
SEEMS TO ALREADY HAVE.
I-I DON'T --
I DON'T BUY INTO THAT.
I THINK WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING
IS NOT QUITTING YOUR DAY JOB,
CALLING THIS WHAT IT IS --
A UNIQUE HOBBY FOR A COUPLE
OF MONTHS OF THE YEAR --
AND TRYING TO EXTRACT OUT OF IT
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS
A MILLION BUCKS FOR YOU.
I DON'T REALLY SEE IT
AS AN INVESTMENT.
I DON'T SEEN MENSCH ON A BENCH
BEING A $10 MILLION TOY.
I REALLY DON'T. AND LOOK,
I-I-I COME FROM YOUR SPACE.
SURE.
I WORKED AT MATTEL
FOR A WHILE.
WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS REMARKABLE,
JUST <i>GETTING</i> A PLUSH
INTO RETAIL.
BUT I'M NOT BUYING INTO THE BIG,
UH, YOU KNOW, MENSCHY THE --
THE -- THE REINDEER, AND --
AND APPS AND ALL THAT STUFF.
I'M -- I'M NOT THERE
FOR THAT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Cuban: MY ISSUE RIGHT NOW --
WE KEEP ON ASKING YOU HOW YOU'RE
GONNA TURN IT INTO A COMPANY,
AND YOU KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT
WANTING TO HAVE I.P.
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WANT TO
GROW YOURSELF INTO BANKRUPTCY.
IT -- IT'S GREAT
TO HAVE BIG AMBITIONS,
RIGHT,
BUT YOU GOT TO GET THERE.
YOU'VE GOT THE CART
BEFORE THE HORSE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Herjavec: NEAL, YOU KNOW,
THE CROATIAN COMMUNITY
IS VERY AKIN
TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.
I LOVE THE IDEA.
THANK YOU.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO
CONTINUE TO EXTEND IT.
I THINK THAT THE OTHER THINGS
YOU'VE TRIED TO THROW AT US
MIGHT BE THREE, FOUR YEARS
IN THE FUTURE.
OKAY.
I THINK BETWEEN NOW AND THEN,
YOU'VE GOT TO BUILD OUT
THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
BUT I LIKE THAT PATH.
I WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE SALES FOR
THIS FOR THAT HOLIDAY SEASON.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S AN OLD YIDDISH SAYING
THAT SAYS
"HOW IT BEGINS IS HOW IT ENDS."
IT'S SELLING VERY WELL.
LET'S KEEP DOING THAT.
OKAY.
ARE YOU OPEN TO THAT?
I AM OPEN TO THAT.
SO, THEN, ROBERT AND I WOULD
LIKE TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
'CAUSE I ALSO --
I LOVE THE IDEA
OF TEACHING GOOD VALUES
AND MORALS.
AND -- AND I SEE THAT
THERE IS A NEED IN THE
MARKETPLACE FOR THIS.
WE'RE GONNA OFFER YOU
$150,000,
BUT WE WANT 30%.
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I CAME IN
HERE WITH A VERY FAIR VALUATION.
WITH $1 MILLION IN SALES
COMING THIS YEAR,
WE'RE $250,000 PROFITABILITY
THIS YEAR.
WE'RE GONNA DO $500,000
NEXT YEAR.
THAT'S WITHOUT
ANY OF THE OTHER STUFF.
NEAL, YOU GOT TO LEAVE
WITH A SHARK.
THERE'S <i>TWO</i> SHARKS.
LET ME TELL YOU --
I MEAN,
I'M IN WITH LORI ON THAT.
YEP.
LOVE TO BE PART OF THE DEAL.
THERE IS A LOT OF RISK.
I MEAN, I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.
I THINK IT'S A FAIR VALUATION,
ASSUMING NOTHING CHANGES.
I THINK
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY ARTICULATED
HOW YOU'RE GONNA
GROW THE BRAND.
HERE WOULD BE
MY COUNTEROFFER,
'CAUSE I UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE'S SOME RISK TO YOU.
$150,000 FOR 15%,
AND I WILL PERSONALLY GUARANTEE
YOUR $150,000 BACK
IN THREE YEARS.
PERSONALLY.
IF I HAVE TO TAKE OUT
ANOTHER MORTGAGE ON MY HOUSE
TO GIVE THAT TO YOU,
I WILL.
WHOA.
NO, I -- I...
I WILL PUT THAT INTO THE
CONTRACT, MAKE IT RISK-FREE.
NEAL,
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE NECESSARY,
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A BETTER OFFER.
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
NEAL HAS AN OFFER ON THE TABLE
FROM LORI AND ROBERT
FOR $150,000 FOR 30%
OF MENSCH ON A BENCH,
BUT BARBARA
MAY OUTDO THEIR OFFER.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
$150,000 FOR 20%.
THAT'S A LOT BETTER.
I DON'T NEED
YOUR GUARANTEES.
BUT IT COMES WITH
A COUPLE OF CONTINGENCIES
THAT I THINK WOULD ACTUALLY
HELP YOUR PRODUCT.
I LOOK AT THIS BOOK,
AND I SEE A FRIENDLY GUY
WITH AN ADORABLE FACE.
I LOOK AT YOUR DOLL,
AND I SEE A NERVOUS OLD MAN.
OKAY.
TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT FACES.
THE CONTINGENCIES ARE
THAT WE CAN REDRAW HIS FACE
SO THAT HE ACTUALLY LOOKS
FRIENDLY AND HUGGABLE...
OKAY.
...'CAUSE HE DOESN'T,
ALL RIGHT?
HE LOOKS DUSTY,
LIKE I WANT TO RETIRE HIM, OKAY?
YEAH. THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
AND ALSO,
WHEN I LOOK THROUGH YOUR BOOK,
IT ENDS WITH 10 RULES.
YEP.
KIDS HATE RULES.
IT'S SUCH
A NEGATIVE NOTE
THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY
TO REWRITE THE BOOK.
BY THE TIME BARBARA'S FINISHED,
THE MENSCH IS GONNA BE CATHOLIC.
THOSE ARE THE TWO --
[ LAUGHTER ]
MY WIFE IS CATHOLIC,
SO THAT'S WONDERFUL!
I THINK YOU'VE GONE IN
A GOOD DIRECTION WITH THE BOOK.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO BARBARA,
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T REWRITE
THE ENTIRE THING.
SOMETHING'S WORKING, RIGHT?
NO, JUST SOME --
JUST CHANGE IT A BIT.
I MEAN, I-I THINK SHE HAS
A GREAT POINT WITH THE FACE.
THE GUY IN THE BOOK
IS VERY JOVIAL.
MM-HMM.
THE DOLL GUY
I-IS A LITTLE, UH...
WE CAN WORK ON THAT.
NOT AS FRIENDLY.
YEAH.
WE CAN WORK ON THAT.
WHAT A CREATIVE IDEA.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOUR COUNTER, NEAL,
WAS $150,000 FOR 15%.
WITH GUARANTEED PAYBACK
OVER THREE YEARS.
DONE.
DONE.
I'M...
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO!
COME ON IN.
MAZEL TOV!
HEY!
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK, NEAL.
DO WE GET TO KEEP
THE BIG GUY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU.
I'M GOING IN MONDAY,
I'M QUITTING MY JOB,
AND I'M A FULL-TIME
MENSCH ON A BENCH EMPLOYEE.
SO I-I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.
Narrator: IN SEASON FIVE,
MORRI CHOWAIKI MADE A DEAL
WITH DAYMOND JOHN
FOR HIS INTERFAITH
HOLIDAY PRODUCT,
THE HANUKKAH TREE TOPPER.
KISS ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
[ CAR HORN HONKS ]
Chowaiki:
PARTNERING WITH DAYMOND
WAS THE BEST THING I COULD HAVE
EVER DONE FOR MY BUSINESS.
HEY, MAN.
WHAT'S UP, MORRI?
WHAT'S UP, MAN?
OH! GREAT TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.
DAYMOND IMMEDIATELY SAW
MY PRODUCT AND BRAND
AS A VALUABLE
LICENSING OPPORTUNITY.
KURT ADLER'S
HANDLING EVERYTHING FOR US.
THIS IS A LICENSING
DREAM COME TRUE.
John:
WITHIN WEEKS OF DOING OUR DEAL,
WE CLOSED A BIG LICENSING DEAL
WITH KURT S. ADLER.
THEY ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST
IMPORTERS AND DISTRIBUTORS
OF HOLIDAY DECORATIONS
IN THE INDUSTRY.
YOU HAVE TO SEE
THIS SHOWROOM.
IT'S LIKE WILLY WONKA'S
CHOCOLATE FACTORY
MEETS CHRISTMAS.
COME ON.
I MEAN,
YOU ARE GONNA LOVE THIS THING.
HERE IT IS.
UH-HUH.
LOOK AT THIS.
WOW.
Chowaiki: THE KURT S. ADLER
SHOWROOM HAS GOT TO BE
ONE OF THE IMPRESSIVE THINGS
I'VE EVER SEEN.
I HAVE A GOOD FEELING THIS IS
THE HANUKKAH TREE TOPPERS.
OH, LOOK AT THIS.
AND THEN, TO SEE MY HANUKKAH
TREE TOPPERS UP THERE --
IT'S A SURREAL EXPERIENCE.
WOW, LOOK, IT'S CHRISTMAS.
HOWARD!
HEY,
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
John: KURT S. ADLER ALREADY
SELLS TO ALL THE BIG-BOX CHAINS,
SO THEY'VE TAKEN OUT
ALL THE HASSLE FOR US.
WE'VE HAD A GREAT RESPONSE
THIS YEAR FROM YOUR PRODUCT,
AND WE EXPECT IT
TO CONTINUE.
John: WITH OUR LICENSING
AGREEMENT, THEY'VE ALREADY
TAKEN THE HANUKKAH TREE TOPPER
INTO TOYS "R" US,
AND THEY'RE EXPANDING OUR
FOOTPRINT IN BED BATH &amp; BEYOND.
AND HERE'S SOME THINGS
FOR OUR 2015 CATALOG.
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER DESIGN,
MANUFACTURING, ADVERTISING.
YOU NAME IT,
THEY'RE DOING IT.
AND MORRI AND I
GET A ROYALTY
OFF OF EVERY
HANUKKAH TREE TOPPER THEY SELL.
NOW I GET TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S NEXT.
BEFORE AIRING
ON "SHARK TANK,"
IT TOOK 3 YEARS
TO REACH $150,000 IN SALES.
SINCE MAKING A DEAL
ON "SHARK TANK" ONE YEAR AGO,
WE'VE ALREADY DOUBLED OUR SALES
TO $300,000.
WE'RE BECOMING A HOUSEHOLD NAME
IN THE ORNAMENT BUSINESS
AND MAKING INTERFAITH FAMILIES
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SMILE.
John:
IN THE SPIRIT OF GIVING,
MORRI AND I DECIDED TO MAKE
A DONATION TO TOYS FOR TOTS,
BECAUSE EVERY CHILD DESERVES TO
BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN EASIER WAY
TO ADD SPARKLE TO THE HOLIDAYS.
HELLO, SHARKS.
