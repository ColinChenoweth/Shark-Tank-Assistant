HELLO! MY NAME IS ANDREA CAO,
AND I AM 13 YEARS OLD.
HELLO. MY NAME'S HONG.
I'M ANDREA'S MOM.
WE ARE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO,
CALIFORNIA.
WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF THE Q-FLEX.
WE ARE SEEKING $20,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF OUR COMPANY.
I'M A NURSE.
I HAVE TO WORK LONG HOURS.
AND AFTER ONE WHOLE DAY
WORKING ON MY FEET,
I COME HOME SO SORE
I CAN BARELY MOVE.
AND GUESS WHO SHE TURNED TO.
THAT'S RIGHT, ME.
I WILL BEG ANDREA
TO MASSAGE MY BACK FOR ME.
AND I LOVE MY MOM, BUT I WAS
GETTING REALLY TIRED OF THAT.
SO I STARTED WONDERING,
WAS THERE ANY INEXPENSIVE,
EFFECTIVE WAY
FOR HER TO DO THIS
HERSELF?
THERE WASN'T,
SO THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED
TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS
AND MAKE ONE OURSELVES.
WE SPEND MONTHS DRAWING OUT,
PLANNING,
AND TESTING IT
TO PERFECTION,
AND FINALLY,
THE Q-FLEX WAS BORN.
THE Q-FLEX IS
A PERSONAL ACUPRESSURE SYSTEM
THAT IS DESIGNED
TO BE USED
ON YOUR SORE SPOTS
AND KNOTTED MUSCLES
TO RELIEVE TENSION
AND PAIN.
THIS AWESOME PRODUCT CAN
GIVE YOU A REALLY NICE MASSAGE
WITHOUT THOSE HUGE,
SCARY MASSAGE CHAIRS,
AND WITHOUT GOING TO
A PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE PARLOR
AND MAKING YOUR WALLET SORE,
TOO.
I MEAN,
YOU'RE ALREADY SORE ENOUGH.
AND THE BEST PART IS,
IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE Q-FLEX
ANYWHERE WITH YOU
BECAUSE IT'S SO LIGHTWEIGHT
AND PORTABLE.
SHARKS, WITH 65 MILLION PEOPLE
SUFFERING FROM BACK PAIN ALONE,
THERE IS A HUGE MARKET
FOR THIS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS --
CHA-CHING!
SO, SHARKS,
COME WITH US,
AND LET'S FLEX OUR WAY
TO SUCCESS.
I HAVE SOME SAMPLES
TO PASS OUT FOR YOU GUYS.
Herjavec: COOL.
Greiner: GREAT.
ANDREA,
I THINK YOU'RE LYING TO US.
REALLY?
YEAH.
OH, NO.
YEAH. THERE'S --
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE 13.
Cuban: NO KIDDING.
OH.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
THAT WAS
A FANTASTIC PRESENTATION.
THANK YOU.
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
SO, ONCE YOU GET BACK THERE,
I'M GONNA ASK YOU HOW WE USE IT,
BUT I'M ASSUMING
I JUST KIND OF, LIKE,
BEAT LORI ON THE BACK
A LITTLE BIT?
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WELL, NO.
DO YOU LIKE IT?!
I KNOW!
SO, TELL ME HOW IT WORKS.
Andrea: OKAY, SO FIRST...
IT'S GREAT.
...YOU'RE GONNA GRIP
THE CUSHIONED GRIP,
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
PUT THE TIP OF THE Q-FLEX
ON THE AREA THAT IS SORE.
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA PULL AND
RELEASE AND PULL AND RELEASE.
AND DO THAT A COUPLE TIMES,
AND THEN THAT'S WHAT --
THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DONE.
O'Leary: THAT'S IT?
ACTUALLY,
IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD.
Hong: SO, THE IDEA --
Corcoran: LET ME TELL YOU,
IT FEELS FABULOUS.
THANK YOU!
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY OF THESE?
YES, I'VE SOLD 800.
800.
800?
AND WHERE
WERE YOU SELLING THEM?
UM, I GO DOOR-TO-DOOR
SELLING THEM IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD FOR YOU! YEAH!
I LOVE THAT.
Andrea: THANK YOU.
BAM!
AND FROM THERE,
WORD OF MOUTH SPREADS.
THEIR FRIENDS, UM,
COME AND BUY THEM FROM US,
AND THEN
THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
FROM $25 TO $36.
HOW MUCH
DO THEY COST TO MAKE?
$4.50.
[ CHUCKLES ]
A CAPITALIST IS BORN!
Greiner: $25 TO $36.
YOU MAKE THEM HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES?
YES, WE DO.
AND DO YOU HAVE A WEBSITE
WHERE YOU CAN BUY THEM?
UH, WE'RE CURRENTLY
WORKING ON THAT.
ANDREA, DO YOU HAVE
A PATENT ON IT OR ANY...?
UM, WE ARE WORKING WITH AN
ATTORNEY TO FILE FOR A PATENT.
PATENT ATTORNEY
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.
ANDREA, FANTASTIC JOB
ON THE PRESENTATION.
THANK YOU.
I CAN'T TELL YOU, IN THE SIX
SEASONS, HOW MANY PEOPLE
STAND EXACTLY
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING,
AND WE ASK THEM,
"DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?"
AND THEY COME UP
WITH A MILLION EXCUSES.
Cuban: YEP.
AND YOU SIMPLY WENT OUT, KNOCKED
DOOR-TO-DOOR, AND DID IT.
THANK YOU.
AND JUST CRUSHED IT.
YOU CRUSHED IT.
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
I-I DON'T USUALLY
ASK THIS QUESTION,
BUT WHAT'S THERE
TO STOP SOMEBODY
FROM KNOCKING YOU OFF
ON IT?
WELL, WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON,
UH, CREATING THE RIGHT ANGLE,
AND WE ACTUALLY ARE THE ONLY
PRODUCT THAT USES A SOLID,
SPECIALLY-FORMULATED,
BULLET-PROOF PLASTIC,
WHICH GIVES THE RIGHT AMOUNT
OF FLEX COMBINED WITH THE ANGLE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESEARCH
THAT SAYS THIS WORKS WELL
OR IS CERTIFIED
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
ACTUALLY, I'M A NURSE,
AND THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS,
WHEN OUR BODY HAS PAIN,
BLOOD FLOW
TO THAT PROBLEM AREA.
SO BY STIMULATING
THOSE PRESSURE POINTS,
YOU ACTUALLY INCREASE
THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE AREA.
OH, I SEE. SO --
SO IF YOU MASSAGE THE AREA,
YOU GET MORE BLOOD FLOW,
AND YOU GET MORE ENERGY.
YES.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY?
WE WOULD USE THE MONEY
TO BUY A STAINLESS-STEEL MOLD
SO WE COULD MAKE
A LOT MORE.
AND, ALSO, WE'RE NOT JUST HERE
FOR THE INVESTMENT --
AND WHAT WOULD THAT COST,
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING?
$20,000.
AND DO YOU MIND IF I ASK,
DID YOU MENTION EARLIER
HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU PUT IN THE COMPANY SO FAR?
WE HAVE INITIALLY PUT $10,000
AND OVERALL, $20,000.
THAT'S A BIG INVESTMENT
IN YOUR 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WHO WAS PROBABLY 12
AT THE TIME.
AND WHAT WERE YOUR TOTAL SALES
IN DOLLARS?
AROUND $20,000.
SO, YOU MADE SOME GOOD MONEY,
THEN.
YOU'VE -- BUT YOU'VE --
HAVE YOU PAID YOUR MOM BACK?
UH, WE'RE STILL
A LITTLE BIT UNDER.
YEAH.
JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDER.
SO YOU'VE GOT
MOST OF YOUR MONEY BACK ALREADY.
YES.
OOH! I LOVE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
GOOD FOR YOU.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YOU'RE 13.
YOU MUST BE IN GRADE 7 OR 8?
8, YEAH.
OKAY, YOU'RE IN 8th GRADE,
AND YOUR MOTHER'S
A FULL-TIME NURSE.
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU IS QUITTING
YOUR JOB TO RUN Q-FLEX?
HER.
IS THAT RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
BECAUSE I'M OKAY
WITH YOU QUITTING SCHOOL.
THAT WOULD SHOW ME
COMMITMENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: THAT'D BE A MISTAKE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM -- THAT'S
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR DEAL.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A PRODUCT.
IT'S COME OUT OF A NEED,
AN INNOVATION.
BUT TO RUN A BUSINESS
AND TURN THIS INTO A BUSINESS
REQUIRES FULL TIME.
UH, I COULD QUIT, BEC--
I WAS ENGINEER BEFORE.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
A BUSINESSPERSON, THOUGH.
DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE AN ENGINEER?
YES,
WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND?
I-I WAS AN ENGINEER BEFORE.
YOU WERE?
AND I LOST MY HUSBAND
SEVEN YEARS AGO
DUE TO A HEART ATTACK.
SO DECIDED
TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE,
KIND OF -- KIND OF
HELP PEOPLE DIRECTLY.
AND SO DECIDED
TO QUIT MY ENGINEERING JOB
AND GO TO --
GO TO A NURSING SCHOOL.
NOW I'M AN R.N.
WORKING FULL-TIME IN A HOSPITAL.
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I DON'T KNOW THE BUSINESS SIDE.
WE ARE HERE
LOOKING FOR A MENTOR.
I APPLAUD YOU TO WANTING
TO GIVE BACK, TO BE A NURSE.
I MEAN, THAT'S PHENOMENAL.
IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS
IN THE WORLD.
BUT ON A DAY-BY-DAY BASIS,
YOU KNOW,
I-I CAN'T CALL YOU EVERY DAY
AND TALK ABOUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA SELL IT.
THIS IS A HOBBY
FOR YOUR FAMILY.
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS YET.
IT'S A PRODUCT.
THE KID CAN'T QUIT SCHOOL.
YOU SHOULDN'T QUIT YOUR JOB
IN THE CURRENT SITUATION.
I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH IT,
BUT IT'S, IN MY VIEW,
NOT INVESTABLE.
I'M OUT.
Greiner:
I FEEL SO BAD SAYING THIS.
I USED TO SELL A PRODUCT
THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR.
IT HAD THE SIMILAR SHAPE.
Cuban: WELL, LORI,
HOW DID YOU DO WITH IT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT PRODUCT.
UM, IT WAS
A CHALLENGING PRODUCT TO SELL.
WHY?
IT ENDED TRAGICALLY.
I'M NOT REALLY POSITIVE WHY IT
DIDN'T WORK, 'CAUSE I LOVED IT.
SO, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU
AND WOULD LOVE TO INVEST IN YOU,
I FEAR FOR THE PRODUCT
AS NOT BEING SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD MAKE SUCCESSFUL.
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LORI, DO YOU WORRY THAT
THEY WON'T GET A PATENT FOR IT?
I DO. I-I WOULD TELL HONESTLY,
I WOULDN'T SPEND THE MONEY.
ANDREA, YOU KNOW, LIKE EVERYBODY
UP HERE'S TOLD YOU,
VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE
IN THE PRODUCT
AS MUCH AS
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
SO, FOR THAT REASON, I WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST, BUT I'M OUT.
Cuban:
NO, WE'LL DO ALL THE WORK.
WE RUN
ALL THE OPERATIONAL STUFF.
WE'LL DO THE ACCOUNTING.
LOT OF CHATTER OVER THERE.
I'VE GOT PEOPLE
TO DO ALL THE ACCOUNTING.
I MEAN, LOOK, I THINK
YOU'RE A GREAT ROLE MODEL.
THANK YOU.
I THINK, WITH SOME HELP --
YOU KNOW, BARBARA AND I
WORK TOGETHER WELL.
I CAN WHIP UP A WEBSITE
AND GET IT UP AND RUNNING.
Corcoran:
WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
$25,000 FOR 25%.
BUT BETTER THAN THAT,
WE'RE GONNA RUN
ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR YOU.
THE ONLY CONTINGENCY IS
YOU HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE ON-CALL
FOR A SALES CALL.
OKAY.
BECAUSE <i>YOU</i> ARE GONNA
SELL LIKE CRAZY.
YEAH, YOU ARE.
Andrea: THANK YOU.
Corcoran:
SO, $25,000 FOR 25%, LADIES.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
DEAL.
DEAL.
YES!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OH, MY GOSH.
Greiner: CAN'T BEAT THAT.
WHOO!
THANK YOU.
MY PLEASURE.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
Andrea: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.
THANK YOU.
Greiner:
NICE JOB. CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Andrea:
MY LEGS ARE SHAKING SO MUCH.
IT DOESN'T FEEL REAL.
IT FEELS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
AND WE'RE JUST SO EXCITED
TO BE ABLE
TO WORK
WITH MARK AND BARBARA.
BARBARA, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LOOK SO RELAXED.
NO, I'M TELLING YOU, IT TOOK OUT
EVERY BAD MUSCLE IN MY BACK.
JUST LIKE THAT.
