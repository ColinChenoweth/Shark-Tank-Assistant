MY NAME'S NEAL HOFFMAN
FROM CINCINNATI, OHIO,
YOU HATE INVENTORY.
HE HATES EVERYTHING, NEAL.
O'Leary: BUT, NEAL, YOU KNOW
THERE'S AN INVENTORY ISSUE,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE PRODUCT THERE FOR THOSE
THAT WANT TO BUY IT, BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO GUESSTIMATE RIGHT
HOW MANY ARE GOING
TO BE THERE TO BUY IT.
SO, WHAT I'VE DONE
WITH THE RETAILERS THIS YEAR IS,
THEY ARE BUYING IT
F.O.B. CHINA,
SO THE RETAILERS TAKE POSSESSION
OF ALL THE INVENTORY.
WE'RE NOT TAKING THE RISK
ON THE INVENTORY.
WELL, TELL US
ABOUT SALES LAST YEAR
VERSUS WHO'S GONNA PLAY WITH YOU
THIS YEAR.
SURE.
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF.
I'M A FORMER
HASBRO TOY EXECUTIVE.
OOH.
I'M NOT JUST A CRAZY JEWISH GUY
COMING OUT HERE.
SO, YOU'RE STILL WORKING?
PART-TIME.
I WORK THREE DAYS A WEEK.
I DO TWO DAYS ON MENSCH.
I'M READY,
IF I GET A DEAL TODAY,
NEAL, WHAT DID YOU SELL THEM
FOR? WHAT DO THEY COST?
THEY COST $7.45 TO MAKE.
WHAT DO THE RETAILERS
SELL THEM FOR?
THE BIG-BOX
WILL BE OUT AT $29.99,
CAN WE SEE THE BOOK
THAT'S INSIDE THE PACKAGE, NEAL?
Greiner: [ Laughing ]
HE NEEDS TO BE GOOD-LOOKING.
O'Leary: HE IS A SCARY-LOOKING
GUY, I GOT TO TELL YOU.
Corcoran:
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
HE'S NOT A FUN-LOOKING GUY.
COULD HE HAVE A SON?
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE SANTA'S
A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.
Hoffman: ABSOLUTELY.
O'Leary: SO -- SO, NEAL,
YOU'RE ASKING FOR A VALUE,
FROM ME AS A SHARK,
THAT ANTICIPATES
YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL GOING
BEYOND MENSCH ON A BENCH SKU,
O'Leary: NEAL, IT SEEMS YOU WANT
TO TAKE YOUR POTENTIAL $250,000
TO $500,000 IN PROFIT
Herjavec: NEAL, YOU KNOW,
THE CROATIAN COMMUNITY
IS VERY AKIN
TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.
I LOVE THE IDEA.
THANK YOU.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO
CONTINUE TO EXTEND IT.
I THINK THAT THE OTHER THINGS
YOU'VE TRIED TO THROW AT US
MIGHT BE THREE, FOUR YEARS
IN THE FUTURE.
NEAL, YOU GOT TO LEAVE
WITH A SHARK.
THERE'S <i>TWO</i> SHARKS.
LET ME TELL YOU --
I MEAN,
I'M IN WITH LORI ON THAT.
YEP.
LOVE TO BE PART OF THE DEAL.
THERE IS A LOT OF RISK.
I MEAN, I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.
I THINK IT'S A FAIR VALUATION,
ASSUMING NOTHING CHANGES.
I THINK
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY ARTICULATED
NEAL,
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE NECESSARY,
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A BETTER OFFER.
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
NEAL HAS AN OFFER ON THE TABLE
FROM LORI AND ROBERT
FOR $150,000 FOR 30%
OF MENSCH ON A BENCH,
BUT BARBARA
MAY OUTDO THEIR OFFER.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
$150,000 FOR 20%.
THAT'S A LOT BETTER.
I DON'T NEED
YOUR GUARANTEES.
BUT IT COMES WITH
A COUPLE OF CONTINGENCIES
THAT I THINK WOULD ACTUALLY
HELP YOUR PRODUCT.
I LOOK AT THIS BOOK,
YOUR COUNTER, NEAL,
WAS $150,000 FOR 15%.
WITH GUARANTEED PAYBACK
OVER THREE YEARS.
DONE.
DONE.
I'M...
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO!
COME ON IN.
MAZEL TOV!
HEY!
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK, NEAL.
DO WE GET TO KEEP
THE BIG GUY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU.
I'M GOING IN MONDAY,
I'M QUITTING MY JOB,
