MY NAME IS NATHAN SHAFFER,
AND I'M FROM HENDERSON, NEVADA.
MY COMPANY IS EVE DROP,
NATHAN,
TELL ME HOW IT WORKS.
SO, I BUILT THIS DISPLAY TO OPEN
UP SO THAT IT COULD FAN OUT,
SO, NATHAN, THAT'S PART
OF THE DEAL, THAT POLE,
OR YOU PAY EXTRA FOR THAT?
YOU PAY EXTRA.
IT'S A SEPARATE SKU.
GIVE US YOUR NUMBERS,
NATHAN.
SALES TO DATE ARE $4,500.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, MY GOD.
NATHAN, LIGHTS OUT.
THE -- YEAH.
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE
ANY PENDING PURCHASE ORDERS.
HOW LONG WAS THAT PERIOD
FOR THE $4,500?
WELL, THERE'S AN EXPLANATION
FOR THAT.
THERE'S A REASON
THOSE NUMBERS --
THERE ALWAYS IS.
THAT NUMBER WAS ACTUALLY RAISED
VIA KICKSTARTER,
A CAMPAIGN THAT I THREW
JUST AFTER THE CHRISTMAS SEASON
JUST TO HELP GET SOME MONEY
TO HELP OFFSET
SOME OF MY PRODUCTION COSTS,
RIGHT?
SO, FROM THERE,
I TOOK THAT MONEY
NATHAN,
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
NATHAN, HOW MANY OF THESE
DO I NEED FOR AN AVERAGE HOME?
ABOUT FIVE PACKS.
THAT'S NOT CHEAP.
THAT'S $40 OR $50,
PLUS THE POLE.
IT'S $40 OR $50.
IT'S A ONE-TIME EXPENSE,
RATHER THAN BUYING CLIPS
YEAR AFTER YEAR.
'CAUSE YOU GUYS KNOW
THOSE DON'T LAST.
NATHAN, WHEN WE HAD
OUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS UP --
NATHAN, WE'VE GOT TO LITIGATE
BARB'S MOM!
HIS ARE EASIER.
YOU KNOW WHAT, NATHAN?
BECAUSE BARB'S MOM
WAS SMARTER THAN YOU, I'M OUT.
OOH.
THANK YOU, MARK.
OOH.
OOH.
OOH.
OOH.
ARE YOU WORKING THIS
FULL-TIME,
OR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER,
GOOD-PAYING JOB?
I HAVE ANOTHER, GOOD-PAYING JOB.
I WORK IN OUTSIDE SALES.
NATHAN, WHERE ARE YOU
IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS?
RIGHT NOW, I AM, UH, WAITING
FOR MY INVENTORY TO ARRIVE.
HOW MUCH INVENTORY
HAVE YOU BOUGHT?
$30,000.
OKAY.
OH, MY FRIEND.
MY FRIEND -- NATHAN -- OKAY.
ONCE YOU'VE FACTORED
IN THE CO-OP --
NATHAN, NATHAN, NATHAN,
RULE NUMBER ONE...
YES.
...WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT,
NEVER SNEER AT AN ORDER,
MY FRIEND.
YES.
THE SALES GUY IN ME
REALLY GETS IRRITABLE
WHEN SOMEONE TURNS DOWN
AN ORDER FROM ANYONE.
I'M OUT.
THAT'S FINE, ROBERT. THE REASON
I DID THAT IS 'CAUSE --
BUT DOES THAT BOTHER YOU
THAT HE JUST DROPPED OUT?
YOU JUST KEPT GOING ON.
NOT EVEN A PAUSE.
I WANT TO PARTNER
WITH THE PERSON
AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD
TO MAYBE BE A HERO.
RIGHT NOW,
I THINK IT'S VERY CHALLENGING.
I THINK YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO
GOOD LUCK, NATHAN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
YOU GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
HAVE A GOOD ONE.
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING,
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST YEAR,
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO MAKE IT ONTO "SHARK TANK."
I'VE WANTED TO BE IN THE TANK.
