MY NAME IS NATHAN SHAFFER,
AND I'M FROM HENDERSON, NEVADA.
MY COMPANY IS EVE DROP,
AND I'M SEEKING $75,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY.
CAN ANY OF YOU
THINK OF SOMEONE YOU KNOW
WHO LOVES
HANGING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS?
[ LAUGHS ]
I DOUBT IT.
IT'S A SERIOUSLY
TEDIOUS TASK.
FIRST, YOU HAVE TO GO
DRAG OUT ALL THE STUFF, RIGHT?
DOES THIS LOOK FAMILIAR?
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO SCALE UP
A RICKETY LADDER
AND DANGLE
FROM THE SIDE OF YOUR ROOF
JUST TRYING
TO INSTALL THESE THINGS.
IT TAKES FOREVER,
JUST TO TAKE THEM DOWN
A FEW SHORT WEEKS LATER.
IF ONLY THERE WAS A BETTER WAY,
RIGHT?
INTRODUCING EVE DROP.
ONCE YOU HANG YOUR CHRISTMAS
LIGHTS WITH EVE DROP,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN
YEAR AFTER YEAR.
EVE DROP IS THE ONLY PRODUCT
ON THE MARKET
WHICH ALLOWS YOU
TO QUICKLY MOVE YOUR LIGHTS
FROM STORAGE MODE
TO DISPLAY MODE.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND WHEN THE SEASON'S OVER,
NO BIG DEAL.
YOU CAN PUT AWAY THOSE LIGHTS
FASTER THAN IT TAKES
TO POLISH OFF A GLASS
OF AUNT EDNA'S EGG NOG.
OBSERVE.
NAILED IT.
SO, WHICH OF YOU SHARKS
WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH ME
AND HELP AMERICA
SPEND LESS TIME DECORATING
AND MORE TIME ENJOYING
THE HOLIDAYS WITH EVE DROP?
NATHAN,
TELL ME HOW IT WORKS.
SO, I BUILT THIS DISPLAY TO OPEN
UP SO THAT IT COULD FAN OUT,
AND WE COULD SHOW YOU GUYS
BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS.
THIS CAP SPINS OFF.
IT HAS A GROOVE.
YOU PLACE THE LIGHT
THROUGH THE GROOVE,
AND THEN
YOU SPIN THE CAP DOWN.
IT APPLIES
JUST A LITTLE PRESSURE
TO PUSH IT AGAINST THE BASE,
WHICH HOLDS IT IN PLACE.
IF YOU WANT TO LOWER IT,
QUARTER-TWIST LOWERS IT.
SO, YOU STILL HAVE TO
GET UP ON THE LADDER
TO RAISE THE LIGHTS UP?
THAT'S OUR SECOND SKU
THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO STORES,
AND THAT'S CALLED
THE EVE DROP POLE ADAPTER.
SO, YOU JUST CAP IT FROM --
YOU'RE STANDING ON THE GROUND,
YOU GIVE IT A QUARTER-TWIST,
AND THEN IT CAN COME DOWN.
QUARTER-TWIST BACK,
AND IT STAYS.
OH, THAT'S KIND OF COOL.
SO, NATHAN, THAT'S PART
OF THE DEAL, THAT POLE,
OR YOU PAY EXTRA FOR THAT?
YOU PAY EXTRA.
IT'S A SEPARATE SKU.
GIVE US YOUR NUMBERS,
NATHAN.
SALES TO DATE ARE $4,500.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, MY GOD.
NATHAN, LIGHTS OUT.
THE -- YEAH.
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE
ANY PENDING PURCHASE ORDERS.
HOW LONG WAS THAT PERIOD
FOR THE $4,500?
WELL, THERE'S AN EXPLANATION
FOR THAT.
THERE'S A REASON
THOSE NUMBERS --
THERE ALWAYS IS.
THAT NUMBER WAS ACTUALLY RAISED
VIA KICKSTARTER,
A CAMPAIGN THAT I THREW
JUST AFTER THE CHRISTMAS SEASON
JUST TO HELP GET SOME MONEY
TO HELP OFFSET
SOME OF MY PRODUCTION COSTS,
RIGHT?
SO, FROM THERE,
I TOOK THAT MONEY
AND I HELPED TO, UH,
PRODUCE SOME OF THE MOLDS
THAT I WOULD NEED
TO MAKE MY PARTS.
SO, I DID THAT OVERSEAS.
THE PARTS
HAVEN'T YET ARRIVED,
WHICH IS WHY THE SALES ARE
THE WAY THAT THEY ARE,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
NATHAN,
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
FOR YOU TO HAND OUT
THE PACKAGING
SO WE CAN SEE IT
AND GET OUR HANDS ON IT.
LET'S DO IT.
OH, SO --
SO <i>THIS</i> IS THE PRODUCT.
HOW MUCH
DOES THIS RETAIL FOR?
$9.99 FOR THE LIGHT HANGERS.
AND THAT RETAILS FOR?
$3.99.
AND THAT'S FOR NOW.
NATHAN, HOW MANY OF THESE
DO I NEED FOR AN AVERAGE HOME?
ABOUT FIVE PACKS.
THAT'S NOT CHEAP.
THAT'S $40 OR $50,
PLUS THE POLE.
IT'S $40 OR $50.
IT'S A ONE-TIME EXPENSE,
RATHER THAN BUYING CLIPS
YEAR AFTER YEAR.
'CAUSE YOU GUYS KNOW
THOSE DON'T LAST.
NATHAN, WHEN WE HAD
OUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS UP --
AND MY MOTHER
WENT WHOLE HOG
PUTTING THEM
ON OUR UGLY, LITTLE HOUSE --
IT WAS THE HIGH POINT
OF HER YEAR.
YEAH.
SADLY FOR YOU,
SHE HAD A BETTER IDEA.
SHE DROVE TWO SETS OF NAILS
BEHIND THE EAVES.
AND WHEN IT WAS
CHRISTMASTIME,
SHE DROPPED THE LIGHTS
DOWN TO THE LOWER SET.
AND WHEN CHRISTMAS
WAS OVER,
SHE LIFTED THEM UP
TO THE HIGHER SET.
DOES YOUR MOM NEED A JOB?
WAIT A SECOND.
Greiner: SO FAR, SHE DID
EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING.
NATHAN, WE'VE GOT TO LITIGATE
BARB'S MOM!
HIS ARE EASIER.
YOU KNOW WHAT, NATHAN?
BECAUSE BARB'S MOM
WAS SMARTER THAN YOU, I'M OUT.
OOH.
THANK YOU, MARK.
OOH.
OOH.
OOH.
OOH.
ARE YOU WORKING THIS
FULL-TIME,
OR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER,
GOOD-PAYING JOB?
I HAVE ANOTHER, GOOD-PAYING JOB.
I WORK IN OUTSIDE SALES.
I SELL JANITORIAL
AND SANITARY PRODUCTS.
I'M ACTUALLY VERY SUCCESSFUL
IN SALES.
LOOK, LET ME CLEAR THE FIELD.
I HATE THIS IDEA A LOT.
IT'S VERY SEASONAL.
I THINK RETAIL'S
GONNA BE VERY CHALLENGING.
AND BECAUSE I HATE IT SO MUCH,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, KEVIN.
NATHAN, WHERE ARE YOU
IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS?
RIGHT NOW, I AM, UH, WAITING
FOR MY INVENTORY TO ARRIVE.
HOW MUCH INVENTORY
HAVE YOU BOUGHT?
$30,000.
OKAY.
AND DO YOU HAVE
ANY OF IT PRE-SOLD?
YES, I DO.
I HAVE P.O.s TO GO INTO A COUPLE
DIFFERENT CHAINS OF STORES.
THE TOTAL P.O.s AT THIS POINT
ARE $3,500.
IT'S GOING
TO 12 DIFFERENT STORES.
OKAY, I'M NOT -- I'M NOT
AS GOOD AT MATH AS BARBARA,
BUT YOU HAVE $30,000
YOU'VE BOUGHT,
AND YOU'VE ONLY SOLD
$3,500.
WHY DID YOU ORDER
SO MUCH AT ONE TIME
WITHOUT HAVING
PURCHASE ORDERS?
I-I-I GUESS THAT'S
THE CONFUSION, THOUGH.
I'M ANTICIPATING
THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.
I ACTUALLY DID GET APPROACHED
BY SkyMall.
THEY WERE INTERESTED.
THEY VETTED IT.
THEY WANTED IT
IN THEIR CHRISTMAS CATALOG.
I ACTUALLY ENDED UP
DECIDING NOT TO DO IT
BECAUSE I ONLY HAD ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY THE $30,000 IN INVENTORY
AND, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I KNOW I'M GONNA SELL IT
AT A HIGHER MARGIN ELSEWHERE.
Greiner: BUT WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.
OH, MY FRIEND.
MY FRIEND -- NATHAN -- OKAY.
ONCE YOU'VE FACTORED
IN THE CO-OP --
NATHAN, NATHAN, NATHAN,
RULE NUMBER ONE...
YES.
...WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT,
NEVER SNEER AT AN ORDER,
MY FRIEND.
YES.
THE SALES GUY IN ME
REALLY GETS IRRITABLE
WHEN SOMEONE TURNS DOWN
AN ORDER FROM ANYONE.
I'M OUT.
THAT'S FINE, ROBERT. THE REASON
I DID THAT IS 'CAUSE --
BUT DOES THAT BOTHER YOU
THAT HE JUST DROPPED OUT?
YOU JUST KEPT GOING ON.
NOT EVEN A PAUSE.
I WANT TO PARTNER
WITH THE PERSON
THAT BELIEVES IN ME
AND THE PRODUCT.
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS YOU.
YES.
YOU'RE NOT PERSUASIVE.
IS THAT RIGHT?
I THINK YO-- YES, VERY MUCH SO.
I THINK YOU --
I AM THE SALESMAN OF THE YEAR
FOR MY COMPANY.
WELL --
I HAVE BEEN
TWO STRAIGHT YEARS.
BUT I HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB.
I HAVE FOUR KIDS AT HOME
AND MY WIFE,
AND I HAVE
A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES.
I DON'T MEAN
FOR THAT TO BE AN EXCUSE --
BUT I MISTRUST
YOUR JUDGMENT.
I THINK
EVERY GREAT ENTREPRENEUR
HAS TO BE A GREAT SALESMAN
TO GET THEIR PRODUCT SOLD,
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO HAVE
INNATE JUDGMENT
OF WHAT TO SPEND,
WHAT TO ORDER,
WHEN TO HOLD BACK,
WHEN TO PUSH FORWARD.
I'M NOT SO SURE
YOU'VE GOT THAT.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I PROJECT
ALL THE TIME WITH MY NUMBERS.
I'M IN SALES,
AND I HIT MY NUMBERS EVERY TIME.
BUT PROJECTED WRONGLY
ON YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
I BELIEVE I DID NOT.
THAT'S WHAT
THE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS ARE FOR.
I HAVE 65 DISPLAYS COMING.
I'M PLANNING ON
PLACING ALL 65.
I'M PLANNING ON
SELLING IT ONLINE,
AND THE MARGIN ONLINE IS 80%.
I HAVE AN E-COMMERCE SITE
SET UP, ALL READY TO GO.
I HAVE AMAZON
WITH THE PRODUCTS LOADED.
INTERESTING. YOU'RE SELLING ME
NOW, YOU KNOW THAT?
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I'M SEEING THE SALESMAN IN YOU.
MAYBE YOU JUST
SAVED YOURSELF FROM DEATH.
LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS.
OKAY.
REALLY?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
LORI?
YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF TAKING REAL CRAP
AND TURNING IT INTO GOLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU, KEVIN!
WOW.
AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD
TO MAYBE BE A HERO.
RIGHT NOW,
I THINK IT'S VERY CHALLENGING.
I THINK YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO
WITH THE PACKAGING, THE DISPLAY,
AND GETTING OUT THERE.
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S OKAY.
O'Leary: OKAY, NOW.
DOWN TO ONE SHARK.
BARBARA.
ON THE ONE HAND, I SEE A LOVELY
GUY THAT SAYS HE CAN SELL,
AND I SAW
A LITTLE BIT OF IT, ALL RIGHT?
I CAN SELL.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I DON'T THINK
YOUR PRODUCT SELLS ITSELF,
EVEN IF YOU COULD
GET IN THE DOOR.
SO, UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, NATHAN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
YOU GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
HAVE A GOOD ONE.
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING,
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST YEAR,
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO MAKE IT ONTO "SHARK TANK."
I'VE WANTED TO BE IN THE TANK.
AND THEN,
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TANK,
YOU WANT NOTHING MORE
TO JUST GET OUT OF THE TANK.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK IS
A PRODUCT INVENTED BY A TEENAGER
TO SOLVE A PROBLEM
SHE HAD AT HOME.
