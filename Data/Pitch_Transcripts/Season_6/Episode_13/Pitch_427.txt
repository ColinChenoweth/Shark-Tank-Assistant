Nick: A DREAM WOKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
IT WAS A VISION
OF SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY.
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...
IF I OFFERED YOU
$30 MILLION FOR THE COMPANY,
WOULD YOU TAKE IT?
NO.
OH!
OH!
Nick: HI, SHARKS.
SO, AS ELYSE IS PASSING THEM OUT
TO YOU GUYS,
THERE'S ONE TRICK TO EATING
A BANTAM BAGEL.
IMAGINE EATING A JELLY DOUGHNUT
FROM THE WRONG SIDE.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
ALL THE GOODNESS
THAT'S ON THE INSIDE
STAYS ON THE INSIDE.
FIND THE HOLE,
BITE THE HOLE.
[ LAUGHS ]
O'Leary:
FIND THE HOLE, BITE THE HOLE.
THAT'S THE HOLE RIGHT THERE.
YOU GOT IT.
Nick: THE HOLE
WHERE THE CREAM CHEESE IS.
OH, I WENT THE WRONG WAY.
SO I AM FINDING THE HOLE.
I AM BITING THE HOLE.
Nick:
$50,000 OF OUR OWN MONEY.
ARE YOU, NICK, GONNA QUIT
YOUR JOB WHEN YOU HAVE THE BABY?
ABSOLUTELY.
Herjavec: NICK, DO YOU MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY ON WALL STREET?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'D SAY IS --
SIX FIGURES.
YES.
HONESTLY, I AM SO READY
TO NOT WORK ON WALL STREET.
Corcoran: YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE
TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PAY
YOUR RENT?
YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE SAVINGS.
Herjavec: HERE'S MY CHALLENGE
WITH YOU GUYS.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MAKING
THE KIND OF MONEY TODAY
THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO
COME ON TO THE "TANK"
WOULD ONLY DREAM OF.
Nick: OKAY.
WELL, BARBARA,
WE APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
WITH WHAT WE'VE PUT IN
Nick:
I THINK WE MADE A GREAT DEAL.
WE WENT IN WITH A NUMBER
THAT WE WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT
