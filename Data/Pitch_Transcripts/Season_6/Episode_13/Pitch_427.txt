Nick: A DREAM WOKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
IT WAS A VISION
OF SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY.
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...
IF I OFFERED YOU
$30 MILLION FOR THE COMPANY,
WOULD YOU TAKE IT?
NO.
OH!
OH!
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.
THE NUMBERS
AREN'T ADDING UP.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE
STUCK ON THE NUMBERS.
WHY NOT?
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
I'VE DONE A HALF-MILLION
DOLLARS' WORTH OF SALES.
WOW.
OUR PROFIT IS NEGATIVE.
THAT SUCKS!
WHAT STOPS SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY
KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS
AND CRUSH YOU
LIKE THE COCKROACH THAT YOU ARE?
I'M NOT A COCKROACH.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Narrator:

Nick: HI, SHARKS.
I'M NICK OLEKSAK,
AND THIS IS MY WIFE, ELYSE,
AND WE'RE THE CREATOR OF
BANTAM BAGELS FROM NEW YORK CITY
ON A MISSION TO...
Both:
CHANGE THE WAY YOU BAGEL!
WHOO!
WE'RE HERE TODAY ASKING
FOR $275,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 11% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
AS COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
GRADUATES,
WE HAVE LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY
FOR OVER 10 YEARS NOW.
SO, IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT
WE LOVE A GOOD NEW YORK BAGEL.
BUT THOSE HUGE, DOUGHY,
HIGH-CALORIE MONSTERS,
THEY'RE SUCH
A COMMITMENT.
AND WE FIND OURSELVES FIGHTING
THE SAME BATTLE --
TO BAGEL OR NOT TO BAGEL.
[ CHUCKLES ]
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO,
A DREAM WOKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
IT WAS A VISION
OF SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY.
MINI...BAGEL BALLS
FILLED WITH CREAM CHEESE!
WOW.
WE KNEW THAT IF WE STARTED
WITH AN AUTHENTIC
NEW YORK-STYLE BAGEL
AND FINISHED WITH HIGH-QUALITY,
UNIQUE CREAM CHEESES
THAT BANTAM BAGELS
WOULD BE MORE
THAN JUST ANOTHER
FLASH-IN-THE-PAN FOOD FAD.
SO, WE TRADED
OUR APARTMENT KITCHEN
FOR A LITTLE SHOP
ON BLEECKER STREET.
AND LUCKY FOR US,
IN LESS THAN A YEAR,
WE WERE VOTED ONE OF THE TOP
THREE BEST BAGELS IN NEW YORK
BY <i>THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS.</i>
WOW.
WE ARE NOW READY TO TAKE
OUR ONE-OF-A-KIND BAGELS
FROM COAST TO COAST.
SO, SHARKS, WE ASK YOU...
Both: ARE YOU READY
TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU BAGEL?
YOU GUYS WANT
TO TRY SOME?
YEAH.
OH, YEAH.
YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, AS ELYSE IS PASSING THEM OUT
TO YOU GUYS,
THERE'S ONE TRICK TO EATING
A BANTAM BAGEL.
IMAGINE EATING A JELLY DOUGHNUT
FROM THE WRONG SIDE.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
ALL THE GOODNESS
THAT'S ON THE INSIDE
STAYS ON THE INSIDE.
FIND THE HOLE,
BITE THE HOLE.
[ LAUGHS ]
O'Leary:
FIND THE HOLE, BITE THE HOLE.
THAT'S THE HOLE RIGHT THERE.
YOU GOT IT.
Nick: THE HOLE
WHERE THE CREAM CHEESE IS.
OH, I WENT THE WRONG WAY.
SO I AM FINDING THE HOLE.
I AM BITING THE HOLE.
FIND IT AND BITE IT.
OH, WOW.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU, YEAH.
WOW.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S ONE
OF OUR BEST SELLERS.
IT'S CALLED THE --
IT'S CALLED THE FRENCH TOAST.
Greiner:
I JUST ATE THAT. MMM!
YEAH.
IT'S A NUTMEG,
EGG, CINNAMON BAGEL.
I LOVE IT.
I LOVE IT!
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec:
WHAT'S THIS ONE?
IT'S A CHEDDAR EGG BAGEL.
AND THEN CREAM CHEESE IS
A BACON CHEDDAR CREAM CHEESE.
O'Leary: HOW MANY
DIFFERENT VERSIONS DO YOU HAVE?
AT ANY GIVEN TIME, WE HAVE
ABOUT 18 ON THE SHELVES.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TALK NUMBERS.
HOW MUCH IS
THE BLEECKER STREET LOCATION
DOING IN REVENUE A YEAR?
FROM THE RETAIL SIDE,
SINCE INCEPTION,
WE HAVE DONE $200,000.
WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE THESE?
EACH BANTAM COSTS 30 CENTS
TO MAKE.
Greiner: IF I WALK IN
AND I BUY ONE, WHAT IS IT?
$1.50.
ONE BALL COSTS $1.50?
YES.
AND PEOPLE BUY IT.
Herjavec: ARE THEY BUYING IT
BECAUSE IT'S A NOVELTY
OR DO PEOPLE
ACTUALLY COME BACK?
THEY'RE DEFINITELY COMING BACK.
WE HAVE OUR REGULARS.
A LOT OF MOMS AND KIDS.
WE HAVE
A LOT OF MOMS AND KIDS.
SO, WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN?
WHAT DO YOU NEED WITH $275,000?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD
A COMMERCIAL COMMISSARY
BAKING FACILITY
SO THAT -- BASICALLY, RIGHT NOW,
IF WE WANT A BAG OF FLOUR,
THAT'S ALL WE CAN GET.
WE CAN'T GET
A PALLET OF FLOUR.
RIGHT. I GET IT.
AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU --
THAT WOULD INCREASE
YOUR CAPACITY BY 25 TIMES.
NOW WHAT HAPPENS?
MORE STORES?
OKAY.
WE KNEW AT THE BEGINNING
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TRY
A COUPLE DIFFERENT
STRATEGIC AVENUES.
SO, WE STARTED OFF THINKING,
"THIS RETAIL CHANNEL,
THAT'S RIGHT FOR US."
SO, WE TESTED IT OUT.
WE KILLED IT.
THE REVENUE WAS INCREDIBLE.
MARGINS, NOT SO MUCH.
WHY?
BECAUSE OF THE SEASONALITY
AND THE UNPREDICTABILITY
OF CUSTOMERS.
THERE WAS A --
LABOR WAS PRETTY HIGH.
SO, WE SMARTENED UP
AND SAID, "WE BETTER TRY
A DIFFERENT CHANNEL."
WE CLAWED AND SCRATCHED
AND GOT OUR WAY
INTO SOME PRETTY BIG
WHOLESALE AVENUES,
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN --
WHO?
THE, UM --
SO, OUR BIGGEST
WHOLESALE ACCOUNT IS QVC.
QVC?
QVC?
HOW WELL ARE YOU SELLING
ON QVC?
OUR FIRST TIME ON THERE,
WE SOLD OUT IN FIVE MINUTES.
OKAY. HOW MANY ARE BEING BOUGHT?
WHAT PRICE?
WE SOLD A PACK OF 36,
$17.80 COST TO US,
AND QVC BUYS IT FOR $19.80.
SO, WE MAKE $2 PER PACK.
WHOA.
OH, LORD.
THAT SUCKS.
WELCOME TO QVC.
THAT'S ROUGH.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ANYMORE?
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
BECAUSE
THERE'S NO BETTER WAY
TO GET IN FRONT
OF 8 MILLION PEOPLE.
LOOK. YOU MAY NOT SPEND
ANY TIME
DEVELOPING A DISTRIBUTION
STRATEGY OTHER THAN
DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER BECAUSE
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE,
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
$275,000 OF CASH.
THAT LETS YOU SET UP
ONE COMMERCIAL KITCHEN,
ONE WEBSITE,
AND FOCUS METICULOUSLY ON THAT
TO GET READY
FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF "SHARK TANK" VIEWERS
WHO ARE GONNA WANT TO TRY THIS.
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS IRRELEVANT
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY MONEY ON ANYTHING ELSE.
Cuban: HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GUYS
INVESTED OF YOUR OWN,
OF YOUR MONEY,
AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM?
Nick:
$50,000 OF OUR OWN MONEY.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, TO START
THIS, WE HAD TO RAISE MONEY.
SO, WE'RE BOTH
FROM WALL STREET.
WHERE DID YOU WORK
ON WALL STREET? WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WORKED AT MORGAN STANLEY
IN ASSET MANAGEMENT.
Nick: AND I'M ACTUALLY
STILL CURRENTLY WORKING
AS A CREDIT BROKER
AT GFI GROUP.
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE
FROM THE OTHER INVESTORS?
JUST UNDER $600,000.
AND WHAT DO THEY OWN?
WE'VE ALLOCATED
23% OF THE COMPANY.
ARE YOU, NICK, GONNA QUIT
YOUR JOB WHEN YOU HAVE THE BABY?
ABSOLUTELY.
Herjavec: NICK, DO YOU MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY ON WALL STREET?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'D SAY IS --
SIX FIGURES.
YES.
HONESTLY, I AM SO READY
TO NOT WORK ON WALL STREET.
Corcoran: YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE
TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PAY
YOUR RENT?
YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE SAVINGS.
Herjavec: HERE'S MY CHALLENGE
WITH YOU GUYS.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MAKING
THE KIND OF MONEY TODAY
THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO
COME ON TO THE "TANK"
WOULD ONLY DREAM OF.
AND THERE'S A LACK
OF DESPERATION
THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE MAKING
SIX FIGURES AND HAVE MONEY.
YOU NEED
THAT SENSE OF DESPERATION.
YOU HAVE A GOLD MINE HERE
AND YOU'RE TRYING THIS,
"EH, IT KIND OF DOESN'T WORK.
WE'LL TRY THIS."
MAN,
WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT,
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND THAT ONE IDEA
AND YOU'VE GOT TO RUN WITH IT.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO, BABY.
CAN I SPEAK ABOUT IT
A LITTLE BIT?
AND RESPECTFULLY,
THAT'S SO DIFFICULT TO HEAR,
BECAUSE IF YOU ONLY KNEW --
EVERY DOLLAR WE DON'T MAKE
BLEEDS THROUGH OUR SYSTEM.
WE FEEL IT.
IT HURTS.
IF YOU THINK, FOR ANY MOMENT,
THAT THIS ISN'T WHO I AM
AND WHO I'VE POURED
THE LAST YEAR OF MY LIFE INTO,
THEN I'M JUST NOT
COMMUNICATING WELL TO YOU.
Cuban:
BUT, ROBERT, IT'S SO WRONG.
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE
IS THAT NONE OF US HERE
CAN BE
GOOD ENTREPRENEURS ANYMORE.
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING AT ALL, MARK.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS --
WE CAN'T DO A STARTUP?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
THIS IS A FANTASTIC IDEA.
THEY'RE TRYING
TOO MANY THINGS.
AND WE'RE WILLING TO LISTEN
TO YOUR INSIGHT.
WE'RE COACHABLE.
YOU KNOW, IF ONE OF YOU
FELT LIKE THIS IS IT,
THIS IS THE WAY TO GO,
WE TRUST THAT.
GUYS, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU JUST SAID,
"WE'RE COACHABLE."
YOU DON'T YET KNOW
WHERE THE BEST PLACE TO GO IS.
I THINK
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT,
BUT IT'S GONNA BE EXPENSIVE,
TIME-CONSUMING.
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE
IN THE BAGEL BUSINESS
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
I CAN PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION
FOR YOU.
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO THROUGH
A LOT OF DIFFERENT TRIES.
I CAN'T HELP YOU RIGHT NOW.
WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
OH.
I'M REALLY
A PERFECT PARTNER.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE GONE TO BED
LAST NIGHT
AND HAD THE BEST DREAM OF YOUR
LIFE AND NOT HAVE ME IN IT.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
IT'S THE TRUTH.
THOSE ARE CALLED NIGHTMARES,
BARB.
I'VE WALKED
THAT ROAD EXACTLY,
IN THE SAME PATTERN
AS YOU'RE WALKING IT NOW,
WITH DAISY CAKE'S.
I'VE GONE TO HELL AND BACK AGAIN
WITH HER,
AND I KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO.
BUT I HAVE A FEW THINGS.
ONE, YOUR BRAND,
I DON'T LIKE.
SECONDLY, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DROP QVC
AT THOSE SKINNY, LITTLE MARGINS
WITH ALL THAT PRESSURE?
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LIKE THAT. THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE THAT AT ALL.
LET THEM DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES,
LORI.
I'M JUST SAYING.
WE -- WE WOULD BE
WILLING TO.
Corcoran:
HERE'S MY OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $275,000,
BUT I WANT 51% OF YOUR GOODS.
OH!
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHY IT'S A GREAT OFFER --
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SUCCEED
WITHOUT ME.
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
NICK AND ELYSE HAVE AN OFFER
FROM BARBARA --
$275,000, BUT FOR 51%
CONTROLLING INTEREST
OF THEIR MINI-BAGEL COMPANY,
BANTAM BAGELS.
Corcoran: I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHY IT'S A GREAT OFFER --
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SUCCEED
WITHOUT ME.
WELL, WE APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,
BARBARA.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
THERE'S ONLY THREE THINGS THAT
YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
ONE,
YOU HAVE TO QUIT YOUR JOB.
TWO, YOU HAVE TO DO A COMMERCIAL
KITCHEN -- NOT OWN IT.
YOU HAVE TO FIND ONE
THAT ALREADY EXISTS.
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO BUILD YOUR OWN, OKAY?
RIGHT.
AND THREE, YOU HAVE TO BE DIRECT
TO CONSUMER.
IF YOU DO ALL OF THOSE,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $275,000
FOR 50%.
NOW, THAT'S TWO PEOPLE
IN YOUR BUSINESS...
THAT MAKES NO SENSE!
...TELLING YOU THAT WE NEED
THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP
TO MAKE THIS MAKE
ANY SENSE.
O'Leary: YOU WANT TO DO
WHAT WICKED CUPCAKES DID.
I'M LOOKING AT IT,
SAYING TO MYSELF, "OKAY.
"BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD ALREADY
WITH WICKED CUPCAKES.
SAME THING."
I DO IT AND MAKE MONEY --
LOTS OF MONEY.
OKAY.
I HAVE AN OFFER.
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE NAME,
EITHER,
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
IT DESCRIBES WHAT IT IS.
AND TO ME, LIKE, CALLING IT,
YOU KNOW, STUFFIN' BAGEL,
BAGEL STUFFIN'S,
SOMETHING WHERE YOU GET IT.
THE OTHER THING THAT
I THINK WOULD BE AWESOME,
I LIKE THE IDEA OF FOOD TRUCKS
FOR YOU.
A GREAT COFFEE
AND STUFFED BAGELS?
WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT?
SO, WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?
HERE'S MY OFFER.
$275,000 FOR 30%.
GUYS, YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
Nick: OKAY.
WELL, BARBARA,
WE APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
WITH WHAT WE'VE PUT IN
AND WHERE WE SEE
THIS BUSINESS GOING
THAT WE CAN GIVE UP
51% OF THE COMPANY.
MAKE ME A COUNTER OFFER.
I COULD SO HELP YOU.
I'M GONNA WALK YOU
THROUGH THE BAKERIES.
I KNOW THE BAD GUYS,
THE GOOD GUYS,
THE GUYS WHO RIP YOU OFF,
THE GUYS WHO STEAL YOUR RECIPES.
WE ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE
THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.
THE ONLY QUESTION IS, ARE
YOU GOING TO MAKE A COUNTER
OFFER TO 51% OR NOT?
UM, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO GO DOWN TO 25%?
WELL, IN ALL THE TIME
THAT WE JUST SAT HERE
AND I'VE HAD MY OFFER
OUT THERE --
WOULD YOU MIND?
I'M GOING TO --
LORI, I DON'T WANT TO --
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,
"WE COULD HAVE SOLD
$100,000 WORTH ON QVC."
WOULD YOU --
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN 25%?
I'LL GIVE YOU 1/3.
I WOULD IF YOU DECIDE RIGHT NOW
WITH ME.
YOU'RE DONE.
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
ALL RIGHT. YAY.
I LOVE THESE THINGS.
OH, AMAZING.
THESE THINGS
ARE AWESOME.
WE LOVE YOU.
DOGGONE.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA GET IT.
Nick:
I THINK WE MADE A GREAT DEAL.
WE WENT IN WITH A NUMBER
THAT WE WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT
WITH THE RIGHT PARTNER
AND THE RIGHT SHARK,
AND SOMEHOW THE STARS ALIGNED
AND WE GOT ALL OF IT.
