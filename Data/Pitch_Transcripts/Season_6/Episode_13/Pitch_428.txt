Adell:
THE MAIN THING THAT ACTUALLY
MAKES OUR MARGINS BETTER
IS POPULATION DENSITY.
THE MORE CUSTOMERS WE HAVE,
THE CLOSER THOSE CUSTOMERS
ARE TO EACH OTHER
IN ANY ONE- OR TWO-HOUR
TIME FRAME,
THE MORE DELIVERIES WE CAN MAKE
AN HOUR, THE LOWER OUR COSTS.
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE DOING
80 DELIVERIES A NIGHT
WITH THREE DRIVERS.
SO, IT DOESN'T TAKE
A WHOLE LOT OF DRIVERS
FOR US TO DO A LOT OF SERVICE.
YOU GO TO NEW YORK
OR YOU COME TO L.A.,
TELL ME
THE MARKETING PLAN
FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT
YOU'RE HERE.
RIGHT NOW, IT'S COSTLY FOR US
TO FIND A CUSTOMER.
OUR BEST CHANNEL RIGHT NOW
IS FACEBOOK.

WE NEED A FEW MORE BIG MARKETS.

RIGHT NOW, THE PLAN FOR

OH, SORRY.
LET ME TAKE THAT BACK.
