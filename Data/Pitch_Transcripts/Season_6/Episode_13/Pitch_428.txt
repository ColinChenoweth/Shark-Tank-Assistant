I'M ZANDER ADELL, AND I'M FROM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.
MY COMPANY IS
DOORMAN PACKAGE DELIVERY.
I'M SEEKING $250,000
FOR A 10% EQUITY IN THE COMPANY.
SO, EVERYBODY LOVES
SHOPPING ONLINE,
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GET
THE STUFF YOU BOUGHT.
EITHER YOU GET A "MISSED
DELIVERY" STICKER ON YOUR DOOR
OR YOUR PACKAGE IS LEFT
ON YOUR FRONT PORCH
WHERE IT'S RAINED ON OR STOLEN,
OR YOU GET TO SPEND A SATURDAY
AT SOME PACKAGE PICK-UP CENTER
MILES FROM YOUR HOUSE.
WHAT IF YOU COULD GET
YOUR PACKAGED DELIVERED AT NIGHT
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY HOME?
AND WHAT IF YOU COULD SCHEDULE
IT ALL FROM AN APP?
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BUILT.
DOORMAN IS
AN ON-DEMAND MOBILE SERVICE
THAT PROVIDES PACKAGE DELIVERY
ON <i>YOUR</i> SCHEDULE.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
WHEN YOU SIGN UP,
YOU GET A NEW SHIPPING ADDRESS
THAT LETS YOU SEND ALL OF
YOUR PACKAGES TO OUR WAREHOUSE.
ONCE THEY ARRIVE, YOU GET
A NOTIFICATION ON YOUR PHONE.
YOU CAN NOW GET
YOUR PACKAGES DELIVERED
TILL MIDNIGHT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION
THAT FINALLY SOLVES
THE LAST THING WRONG
WITH THE QUARTER-TRILLION-DOLLAR
E-COMMERCE MARKET
IN THE UNITED STATES.
AND WE WOULD LOVE YOUR HELP
TO TAKE THIS NATIONWIDE.
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS.
ZANDER, HOW MUCH DO I PAY YOU
FOR AN AVERAGE PACKAGE?
IT'S $3.99 PER PACKAGE.
OR, IF YOU LIKE THE SERVICE,
IT'S 19 BUCKS A MONTH
FOR UNLIMITED.
Corcoran:
AND IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
WHAT SIZE THE PACKAGE IS?
RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE DELIVERY LIMITS
BASED ON OUR CURRENT DEPOT.
40 POUNDS OR OVER,
3? FEET ON A SIDE.
O'Leary:
WHAT CITY IS THIS OPERATING IN?
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE ONLY IN SAN FRANCISCO.
HOW MANY SUBSCRIBERS
DO YOU HAVE?
WE JUST CAME OUT IN MAY.
AND WE NOW HAVE 300 CUSTOMERS
ON OUR PLATFORM.
THEY'VE SHIPPED 4,000 PACKAGES
THROUGH US.
HOW MUCH DID IT COST YOU
TO SET UP THAT MANY CUSTOMERS?
I PUT 50K OF MY OWN MONEY IN.
AND SINCE THEN, WE'VE TAKEN IN
220K OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES.
O'Leary:
SO, THE BUSINESS IS SUCCESSFUL.
THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN PROVEN.
I'M UPS, I'M FedEx.
I SIMPLY ADD THIS FEATURE
TO MY INFRASTRUCTURE.
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
I DON'T NEED YOUR ANSWER, MARK.
I WANT HIS.
EVEN IF ALL OF THEM DID IT,
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN APP
FOR EVERY SINGLE CARRIER,
WHEREAS WE'RE AGNOSTIC.
THE ULTIMATE VISION
FOR THE COMPANY
IS TO HAVE A CHECKBOX
ON RETAIL SITES.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
NOW, IF THAT WAS ON AMAZON,
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.
RIGHT.
I AGREE.
Herjavec:
IT'S A GREAT IDEA,
BUT THE COST TO SET UP A FedEx
WAS MASSIVE.
SO, OUR DRIVERS ARE DRIVING
THEIR OWN CARS.
SO, WE JUST HAVE TO RENT
WAREHOUSE SPACE.
WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE
COSTS OF FedEx OR UPS.
SO, ARE YOU GONNA DELIVER
AT A SPECIFIC TIME?
SO, WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.
SO, OUR FIRST TWO PRICING PLANS
ARE TWO-HOUR DELIVERY WINDOWS.
YOU CAN PICK 6:00 TO 8:00,
8:00 TO 10:00, 10:00 TO 12:00.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE
ONE-HOUR WINDOWS.
Greiner:
I THINK IT IS A GREAT IDEA.
THANK YOU.
PACKAGES
ARE ALWAYS A PROBLEM,
AND I'M ALWAYS ORDERING
ONLINE.
YOU DON'T HAVE A DOORMAN,
LORI?
I DO HAVE A DOORMAN.
OH.
BUT I PURPOSELY STAY
IN A BUILDING WITH A DOORMAN
FOR PACKAGES, LITERALLY.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON ANYONE
WANTS A DOORMAN ANYMORE.
YES.
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW YOU PLAN TO SCALE FROM THIS
BECAUSE I DO SEE IT
BEING A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT
AS YOU KEEP GROWING
BECAUSE PEOPLE WON'T PARTNER
WITH YOU ONLINE UNLESS --
O'Leary: RIGHT. LORI, IT'S UBER.
IT'S UBER ALL OVER AGAIN.
CITY AT A TIME.
YEP.
Adell:
THE MAIN THING THAT ACTUALLY
MAKES OUR MARGINS BETTER
IS POPULATION DENSITY.
THE MORE CUSTOMERS WE HAVE,
THE CLOSER THOSE CUSTOMERS
ARE TO EACH OTHER
IN ANY ONE- OR TWO-HOUR
TIME FRAME,
THE MORE DELIVERIES WE CAN MAKE
AN HOUR, THE LOWER OUR COSTS.
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE DOING
80 DELIVERIES A NIGHT
WITH THREE DRIVERS.
SO, IT DOESN'T TAKE
A WHOLE LOT OF DRIVERS
FOR US TO DO A LOT OF SERVICE.
YOU GO TO NEW YORK
OR YOU COME TO L.A.,
TELL ME
THE MARKETING PLAN
FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT
YOU'RE HERE.
RIGHT NOW, IT'S COSTLY FOR US
TO FIND A CUSTOMER.
OUR BEST CHANNEL RIGHT NOW
IS FACEBOOK.
$37 PER CUSTOMER,
AND THAT'S A LOT.
WOW.
WOW.
THAT'S A LOT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY AGREEMENTS
WITH THE FedExes OR UPSes?
NO.
WE WOULD LIKE TO.
WE'RE JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH YET.
WITH RETAIL SITES, WE CAN HAVE
THESE CONVERSATIONS VERY EASILY.
YOU NEED TO BE
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
O'Leary:
NOT ALL OVER. SEVEN CITIES.
Adell:
WE NEED A FEW MORE BIG MARKETS.
SEVEN CITIES IS LIKE 50%.
RIGHT NOW, THE PLAN FOR
THE SECOND CITY IS CHICAGO.
Greiner: YES!
Corcoran: WE ALL LIKE HIM.
IT'S OBVIOUS.
HE'S VERY TRUSTWORTHY.
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL GO IN
ON THE DEAL.
I LOVE THAT IDEA.
I LOVE THAT IDEA, TOO.
I LIKE IT.
I'M IN.
I'LL DO YOUR ASK.
$250,000, 10%.
I'M IN ON THAT.
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.
I WAS GONNA SAY 20%.
OH, SORRY.
LET ME TAKE THAT BACK.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M IN.
$250,000 FOR 20%.
I'M IN.
ALL RIGHT.
LORI AND I ARE IN.
$250,000 FOR 20%.
BARB, YOU IN?
YEAH, DEFINITELY.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S THREE.
Greiner: MARK?
NO.
KEVIN?
MARK IS SO ARROGANT.
I'M NOT THERE.
I'M NOT ARROGANT.
OH, YES, YOU ARE.
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH THE TIME
AND EFFORT FOR THAT PERCENTAGE.
O'Leary:
WHAT DO YOU CARE MORE FOR?
I MEAN,
DO YOU WANT ONE SHARK?
DO YOU THINK THERE'S VALUE
IN MULTIPLE SHARKS?
THE DREAM, OF COURSE,
IS TO HAVE ALL THE SHARKS.
BUT $250,000 AT 20%,
IT'S -- THAT'S VALUING ALREADY
QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN --
I'VE ALREADY REDUCED
THE VALUE, TOO.
BUT YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE,
ON OUR SIDE,
WE HAVE TO AT LEAST
BE INTERESTED...
OF COURSE.
...TO HELP YOU
WITH THE BUSINESS.
OF COURSE.
AND YOU'VE GOT THREE OF US
INTERESTED.
AND THAT'S SKINNY AS IT IS.
AND THAT'S AWESOME.
AND WE'RE ALL
FROM DIFFERENT CITIES.
WHICH IS VERY COOL.
A LOT OF INFLUENCE
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE CITIES.
Herjavec:
MAKE ME A COUNTER.
20%. I AGREE WITH YOU.
IT'S TOO HIGH.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.
WHY WAS I LISTENING
TO BARBARA AGAIN?
MAKE ME A COUNTER.
UM...$250,000 FOR 12%.
DONE.
OH!
HE DIDN'T SAY DONE.
I'LL DO IT ON MY OWN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
$250,000, 12%.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'LL DO IT RIGHT NOW.
ZANDER'S A SMART GUY.
THAT'S YOUR COUNTER.
I'M FROM CHICAGO. THAT'S WHERE
YOU WANT TO BE NEXT. SO --
WELL, YOU CAN COME IN WITH ME
ON THE DEAL.
YOU JUST CUT ME OUT.
$250,000 FOR 12%.
I'M HAPPY TO DO IT
ON MY OWN.
$250,000, 15%.
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE LORI
COME ALONG.
$250,000 FOR 15%?
ZANDER,
YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING 20%?
UM, I WOULD HAPPILY DO 20%,
BUT FOR MORE CASH.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
Greiner: ZANDER --
ZANDER, I OFFERED YOU EXACTLY
WHAT YOU COUNTERED.
I OFFERED TO COME IN --
I WOULD LOVE MORE SHARKS
IN THE DEAL.
I OFFERED TO COME IN
AT 15% BECAUSE, FOR ME,
IF I'M SPLITTING WITH ROBERT,
NOT WORTH IT FOR LESS.
I KNOW THE TIME AND THE EFFORT
AND THE CARE
AND THE ATTENTION THAT I PUT IN,
AND I AM YOUR CUSTOMER.
I NEED TO HEAR AN ANSWER
ON MY OFFER.
O'Leary: WELL, LET ME ADD
SOME CLARITY TO IT...
AND YOURS WAS $250,000 FOR 15%.
IT WAS $250,000 FOR 15%.
...JUST TO HELP
CLEAR THE FIELD.
AND IT WAS ROBERT AND I
TOGETHER.
HAPPY TO GO ALONG
WITH LORI.
I WOULD PREFER $250,000 FOR 12%,
OF COURSE.
DONE.
WITH HIM.
WITH AS MANY SHARKS AS POSSIBLE.
IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS IN, GREAT.
NO ONE ELSE IS --
I'M OUT.
I'LL DO $250,000
FOR 12% RIGHT NOW.
DONE.
DONE.
ALL RIGHT.
I LOVE THE IDEA.
LOVE THE IDEA.
THANKS, MAN.
THIS IS EXCITING.
VERY EXCITING.
ALL RIGHT?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
OKAY, ZANDER.
I'M OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UNDERSTOOD.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
WHILE IT SEEMED LIKE
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT MORE SHARKS
COULD GET INVOLVED
FOR MORE CASH,
I'M SUPER PSYCHED
TO HAVE ROBERT INVOLVED.
AND SO
I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE THE RISK
OF HAVING EVERYTHING FALL APART.

NEXT UP IS A MARRIED COUPLE

A FAVORITE SNACK.
