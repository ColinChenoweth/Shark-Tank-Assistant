HI, SHARKS.
I'M JULIE KALIMIAN.
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
MY COMPANY IS SkinnyShirt,
AND I AM SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% OF MY BUSINESS.
LADIES, HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED
TO YOU?
YOU PUT ON YOUR FAVORITE
BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT
AND A GORGEOUS SWEATER,
AND, UGH!
INSTEAD OF LOOKING
SLEEK AND SLIM,
YOU LOOK BUNCHY AND BULKY
INSTEAD?
SkinnyShirt
TO THE RESCUE.
I HAVE COMBINED TWO ALL-TIME
FAVORITE CLOTHING ITEMS --
THE CLASSIC BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT
AND THE STRETCHY KNIT CAMI
TO ELIMINATE THE BULK.
BUT SINCE SEEING IS BELIEVING,
KRISTIN HERE
IS GONNA TAKE OFF
HER TRADITIONAL SHIRT
AND SLIP ON A SkinnyShirt
TO SHOW YOU
EXACTLY WHAT A BIG DIFFERENCE
SkinnyShirt CAN MAKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner:
YOU JUST GOT THEIR ATTENTION.
Corcoran: OH, BOYS.
NOW <i>REALLY</i>
GOT YOUR ATTENTION.
Herjavec: [ HUMMING ]
LAYERING IS A CLASSIC
AND EASY WAY TO DRESS.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT NOBODY LIKES IT
WHEN THE LAYERS
MAKE YOU LOOK BIGGER
THAN YOU ACTUALLY ARE.
SO, SAY GOODBYE
TO THAT BULKY SHIRT...
Corcoran: PAY ATTENTION, MEN.
HERE WE GO.
...AND SAY
HELLO TO SkinnyShirt.
SORRY. THERE'S A SHIRT
IN HERE SOMEWHERE?
[ LAUGHS ]
SkinnyShirt CAN BE PAIRED
WITH V-NECKS,
CREW NECKS, BLAZERS,
CARDIGANS, SHIFT DRESSES,
AND IT'S EVEN CUTE ENOUGH
TO BE WORN ALONE.
NOW, <i>THAT</i> WAS EFFECTIVE.
[ LAUGHS ]
GREAT PRESENTATION THERE.
THANK YOU.
DO IT AGAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
KRISTEN, COME ON OUT HERE.
WOW.
NOW, SHARKS, LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE BEFORE AND AFTER.
WHO IS THAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS I'M SURE
YOU WILL ALL AGREE,
KRISTEN LOOKS
MORE PULLED TOGETHER,
NOT TO MENTION SLEEKER,
SMOOTHER, SLIMMER, SEXIER.
SO, NOW,
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
WANTS TO MAKE A FAT PROFIT
ON MY SkinnyShirt?
CAN YOU HAND US ONE OF THE
PACKAGES SO WE CAN CHECK IT OUT?
YES.
KRISTEN HAS ONE
FOR EVERYBODY.
Herjavec:
IS IT JUST A SPORTY MATERIAL
THAT BRINGS THE SHIRT IN?
IS THAT WHY IT'S --
SO, IT'S A STRETCHY KNIT CAMI.
IT'S A SHAPER
OR NOT A SHAPER?
IT IS.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
IT FEEL LIKE A SECOND SKIN,
BUT IT ALSO SMOOTHES YOU OUT
AND HOLDS YOU IN.
Herjavec:
IS THE DESIGN OF IT UNIQUE
OR IS THE MATERIAL UNIQUE?
OR IS IT NOT UNIQUE?
IT IS UNIQUE.
AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS
ON THE MARKETPLACE.
WELL,
I'M ASSUMING IT'S UNIQUE.
IT IS 100% UNIQUE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES,
JULIE?
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS,
I'VE DONE A HALF-MILLION
DOLLARS' WORTH OF SALES.
WOW.
THIS YEAR, I'M ON TRACK
FOR $200,000.
WHAT WAS
JUST LAST YEAR ALONE?
LAST YEAR ALONE WAS $50,000.
WAIT, SO YOU WENT DOWN?
YES,
BECAUSE A TRUSTED FRIEND
INTRODUCED ME TO AN
UNTRUSTWORTHY MANUFACTURER.
AND I HAD TO EAT A LOT OF
BAD PRODUCTION, UNFORTUNATELY.
AND IT TOOK A WHILE
TILL I FOUND A NEW MANUFACTURER
I FELT COMFORTABLE WITH.
SO, I GUESS YOUR TRUSTED FRIEND
ISN'T SO TRUSTWORTHY.
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE THOUGHT
HE WAS DOING ME A FAVOR,
BUT APPARENTLY --
Corcoran:
BUT YOUR FRIEND INTRODUCED YOU,
BUT YOU HIRED
THE MANUFACTURER.
RIGHT.
AND THEY HAD HAD
A GOOD TRACK RECORD.
HAVE YOU SOLVED THAT PROBLEM?
YES.
I HAVE A MANUFACTURER ALREADY
SOURCED IN ASIA WHO CAN --
MY PRODUCT RIGHT NOW,
I'M MANUFACTURING IT
FOR $12.75 A SHIRT
FOR THE SLEEVELESS.
THIS ONE?
YEAH. I HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO'S WILLING TO DO $9.50.
JULIE,
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
$68 FOR THE SLEEVELESS
AND $76 FOR THE LONG SLEEVE.
Greiner: WOW.
AND HOW DO YOU SELL THEM?
2/3 OF MY SALES
ARE ON MY WEBSITE,
AND 1/3
IS THROUGH WHOLESALERS.
I'VE GOT 75 BOUTIQUES
IN THE U.S. AND CANADA.
AND I HAD AN ORDER FOR ONE
PARTICULAR TV RETAILER THAT,
THE DAY IT WAS MEANT TO SHIP,
THIS UNTRUSTWORTHY MANUFACTURER
CALLED ME AND SAID,
"I ONLY HAVE HALF YOUR ORDER."
SO,
YOU HAD A QUALITY ISSUE
SO, WHEN I LAUNCHED --
RIGHT.
I LAUNCHED,
AND I DID ONE LARGE ORDER.
IS YOUR BACKGROUND
IN TEXTILES?
NO.
FASHION?
NOT AT ALL.
I SPENT OVER 15 YEARS IN THE
CORPORATE WORLD IN PUBLISHING
BEFORE I BECAME A STAY-AT-HOME
MOM WITH MY FOUR KIDS
AND HAD MY FIFTH BABY.
WOW.
THANK YOU.
Cuban:
HELP ME WITH THE NUMBERS.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU DONE
YEAR-TO-DATE?
I'VE DONE $70,000.
OKAY.
SO, YOU'VE DONE $70,000
THIS YEAR.
LAST YEAR WE'LL "X" OUT,
RIGHT?
'CAUSE THAT WAS A PROBLEM.
BUT YOU HAD TWO YEARS PRIOR
TO THAT, RIGHT?
YES.
WHAT WAS THE YEAR BEFORE?
$150,000.
AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT
WAS $350,000.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GETTING TO,
RIGHT?
SO, YOU TALKED ABOUT
THIS HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE
IN MANUFACTURING.
YET, THE TWO YEARS PRIOR
TO THAT,
YOU DID FAR MORE BUSINESS
AND WERE AT A FASTER PACE
THAN YOU ARE THIS YEAR.
WHY DID IT FALL IN HALF
TO THE SECOND YEAR?
GREAT QUESTION.
I STOPPED WORKING
WITH THAT MANUFACTURER.
AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME
TO TEE UP A NEW MANUFACTURER.
AND ON TOP OF THAT --
OKAY, WAIT.
SOMETHING'S NOT --
SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING HERE.
WITH ALL THOSE CHALLENGES,
YOU DID MORE
IN THAT FIRST YEAR
THAN YOU'RE ON PACE TO DO
THIS YEAR.
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE INVENTORY
TO MONETIZE.
THAT'S WHAT HAMPERING
THE SALES.
IT'S ALL LOGISTICS PROBLEMS.
NO, IT'S NOT!
MARK, LET ME --
MAYBE I CAN ANSWER IT THIS WAY.
OKAY.
THREE OF MY TOP WHOLESALERS
TOOK A YEAR HIATUS
'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE INVENTORY
TO SELL THEM.
BUT YOU JUST SAID
YOU HAD TO EAT INVENTORY.
BUT EATING THE INVENTORY
WAS UNSALABLE SHIRTS.
AND IT LASTED
TWO AND A HALF YEARS?
NO, IT LASTED ONE YEAR.
BUT THEN I DIDN'T HAVE
THE CAPITAL TO GO OUT
AND MAKE
A SIZEABLE ENOUGH ORDER.
IT HAMPERED MY ABILITY
TO SELL AND DELIVER PRODUCTS.
THE NUMBERS AREN'T ADDING UP,
IS WHERE I'M GOING.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE STUCK
ON THE NUMBERS, THOUGH.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE
SHE HAD BAD-QUALITY GOODS
SO SHE COULDN'T SELL THEM,
SO SHE HAD TO EAT IT.
LET'S STOP TALKING ABOUT
ALL THE PROBLEMS YOU HAD
WITH THE LOGISTICS.
IS THIS A GOOD IDEA OR NOT?
IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA,
WHAT STOPS SOMEBODY WHO
ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE
SHIRTS AND DELIVER THEM,
DO THIS
AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
AND CRUSH YOU LIKE THE COCKROACH
THAT YOU ARE?
OKAY. FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT A COCKROACH.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND SECONDLY --
YOU HAVE NO MARKET SHARE
OF MAYBE A GOOD IDEA.
OKAY.
IT IS PATENT-PENDING.
AND I'VE SOLD 10,000 SHIRTS.
I HAVE GREAT BRANDING.
I HAVE A GREAT TRADEMARK.
I'M HERE BECAUSE I NEED
SOME CAPITAL FOR TWO REASONS --
FOR MANUFACTURING CONTACTS
AND DISTRIBUTION CONTACTS.
SO, I HAVE TO PAY FOR YOU
TO LEARN.
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A BAD PERSON.
IT'S JUST YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BET
FOR ME AS AN INVESTOR
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I DO KNOW WHAT --
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU'VE BLOWN IT A COUPLE
OF TIMES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.
BUT I'M --
Greiner:
SHE'S A BEGINNER.
I'M HERE --
I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE A BEGINNER.
HOW SHE'S GONNA KNOW
JUST AUTOMATICALLY HOW
TO BE A MANUFACTURER?
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY!
AND I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ADMIT IT? YOU'VE NEVER
HAD 12 MONTHS IN A ROW
WHERE YOU'VE
LOGISTICALLY EXECUTED.
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR PRESENTATION,
75% OF IT WAS EXPLAINING
HOW YOU SCREWED UP, BASICALLY.
DON'T COME IN HERE TELLING ME
WHY YOU SCREWED UP.
TELL ME
HOW YOU'VE FIXED IT.
I'M OUT.
JULIE, I GIVE YOU CREDIT
FOR GETTING IT GOING.
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE
ON A ROLL INITIALLY
AND THEN YOU
RAN INTO PROBLEMS
AND JUST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE
TO REGROUP.
I JUST DON'T GET THE SENSE
THAT YOU HAVE A DEFINITIVE PLAN.
FOR THE PLAN, I HAVE LINED UP
AN OVERSEAS MANUFACTURER.
I NEED THE CAPITAL
TO PLACE THAT ORDER.
RIGHT.
THAT'S A CASH-MANAGEMENT ISSUE.
I DON'T THINK
GIVING YOU CASH
SOLVES YOUR ABILITY TO MANAGE
CASH AND DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES.
I STILL THINK THE NUMBERS
DON'T ADD UP.
AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
YOU GUYS LOOK FANTASTIC.
I THINK
IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT.
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S A STAND-ALONE CATEGORY.
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
THE ANSWER TODAY.
AND, YOU KNOW, WHILE GETTING
AN INVESTMENT FROM -- FROM ME
OR ANYBODY HERE IS A JOURNEY,
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING DOWN THAT JOURNEY.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT TODAY.
I'M OUT.
I MEAN,
I THINK THERE'S MERIT TO IT.
PEOPLE LIKE SHAPERS.
MY PROBLEM IS,
IS I DON'T REALLY LIKE
THE LOOK OF A COLLARED SHIRT
UNDER A SWEATER.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
PEOPLE WEAR THAT ANYMORE.
I'M NOT TRYING TO INSULT IT,
BUT I'M JUST --
I NEVER WEAR THAT LOOK.
AND BECAUSE I DON'T GET
THE FASHION STATEMENT THAT WELL,
I'M OUT.
Kalimian: BARBARA?
Corcoran:
ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU HELD YOUR GROUND HERE
VERY WELL TODAY.
THANK YOU.
AND YOU DON'T SEEM BOTHERED
BY THIS GUY ON MY LEFT
WHO'S A BULLY,
THE OTHER BULLY WHO GRILLED YOU
ON MONEY INSIDE AND OUT.
THANK YOU.
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME.
OKAY.
AND THAT IS
THE TIME YOU SPENT
ON TALKING
ABOUT THE MISHAP YOU HAD
WITH THE WRONG MANUFACTURER.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE
LEARNED OVER ALL THE YEARS
OF BEING IN BUSINESS?
I FOUND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE GREAT WINNERS
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
IS NOT THE HITS
BUT HOW LONG THEY TOOK
TO FEEL SORRY FOR THEMSELVES.
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?
THAT'S YOUR ACHILLES' HEEL.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
THIS IS NOT THE END
OF MY COMPANY AT ALL.
I KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA BE
A HUGE SUCCESS,
AND I THINK THAT THE SHARKS
ARE GONNA LOOK BACK
AND BE LIKE, "MM!" YOU KNOW?
"MAYBE WE DIDN'T CONNECT
THE DOTS ON THAT ONE,
BUT, WOW, GOOD FOR HER."
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
WITH A SOLUTION TO A COMMON
PROBLEM WITH ONLINE SHOPPING.
HI, SHARKS.
