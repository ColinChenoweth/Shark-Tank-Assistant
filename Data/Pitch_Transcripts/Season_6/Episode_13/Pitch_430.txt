I'M ARUM.
I'M DAWOON.
I'M SOO.
All:
AND WE'RE THE KANG SISTERS FROM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.
THESE SMELL REALLY GOOD.
IT'S FRENCH LAVENDER.
WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.
THE THREE OF US WERE
BORN AND RAISED IN KOREA.
AND WHEN WE WERE TEENAGERS,
WE IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA.
I WENT
TO STANFORD BUSINESS SCHOOL.
AND I WENT
TO HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.
AND I WENT
TO PARSONS SCHOOL OF DESIGN.
OUR DAD SACRIFICED
SO MUCH
TO SEND THREE OF US TO SCHOOL
IN THE U.S.
FINANCIALLY,
HE HAD TO WORK ALL THE TIME.
AND THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO
JUST LET HIS DAUGHTERS GO
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE,
I THINK THAT WAS REALLY HARD
FOR THEM.
DAWOON,
HOW WAS YOUR DATE?
HE TEXTS ME,
BUT HE'S NOT ASKING ME OUT --
ON A SECOND DATE.
YEAH.
ONE DAY AT LUNCH, WE WERE
DISCUSSING A COMMON PROBLEM
AND CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION
IN THE TECH SPACE
THAT COULD
REALLY WORK.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
WE QUIT OUR HIGH-PAYING JOBS
AND MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO.
AND WE JUST STARTED
OUR OWN BUSINESS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR
UPCOMING MARKETING INITIATIVE.
Arum: WE BELIEVE WE HAVE
SOMETHING VERY BIG ON OUR HANDS,
SOMETHING THAT CAN
POTENTIALLY CHANGE LIVES.
Soo: WITHOUT THE MONEY
FROM THE SHARKS,
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO EXECUTE
OUR GROWTH PLAN,
NOT TO MENTION TO DISAPPOINT
OUR FAMILY
AFTER ALL THAT
THEY HAVE SACRIFICED.
HELLO!
MY NAME IS ARUM.
DAWOON.
AND SOO.
All: AND WE'RE THE KANG SISTERS
FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
[ CHUCKLES ]
TODAY,
WE'RE RAISING $500,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
COFFEE MEETS BAGEL IS HERE
TO PROFOUNDLY CHANGE
HOW PEOPLE DISCOVER
AND FALL IN LOVE.
SHARKS, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
"IT'S ANOTHER
DATING SITE."
WE ALL KNOW
ONLINE DATING SUCKS.
WHY? BECAUSE IT TREATS PEOPLE
AS A PIECE OF INFORMATION
YOU SEARCH FOR
FROM A HUGE DATABASE.
PEOPLE WANT TO GO BACK TO TIME
OF HAPPENSTANCE
WHERE YOU JUST STUMBLE UPON
SOMEONE SPECIAL,
MAYBE THROUGH A FRIEND.
THAT'S WHY WE CREATED
COFFEE MEETS BAGEL.
WE TOOK THE PROVEN CONCEPT
OF DAILY FLASH CELL SITES
AND MERGED IT
WITH SOCIAL-NETWORKING ELEMENTS
TO CREATE THE HIGHEST-QUALITY
DATING SERVICE FOR SINGLES.
Soo:
HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.
EVERY DAY AT NOON,
WE CURATE ONE PERFECT MATCH
WHO IS A FRIEND OF A FRIEND.
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS TO REVIEW
THEIR PROFILE INFORMATION
AND CHOOSE TO LIKE OR PASS
ON THE MATCH.
MUTUAL LIKE LEADS
TO A PRIVATE CHAT LINE
THAT EXPIRES
IN SEVEN DAYS.
THE SECRET TO SUCCESS
IN ONLINE DATING
IS WINNING OVER WOMEN.
[ LAUGHS ]
SINGLE WOMEN ARE TIRED OF
SIGNING UP FOR DATING WEBSITES
ONLY TO GET HIT ON
BY CREEPY STRANGERS
BOMBARDING THEM
WITH DISGUSTING MESSAGES.
Cuban: KEVIN!
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THAT IS WHY WOMEN LOVE
COFFEE MEETS BAGEL.
SINCE OUR NATIONAL LAUNCH,
WE'VE BEEN GROWING
AT DOUBLE DIGITS MONTHLY.
AND NOW, WITH YOUR HELP
AND INVESTMENT,
WE CAN HELP SINGLES
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
SO, SHARKS...
All: WHO'S GOING TO BE
<i>OUR</i> PERFECT MATCH?
Greiner: [ CHUCKLES ]
SO, THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.
O'Leary: WHAT DOES THE BAGEL
GOT TO DO WITH IT?
LET'S JUST BE HONEST.
THERE IS STILL A LITTLE BIT
OF STIGMA WITH ONLINE DATING.
SO, OUR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY LOVE
THE FACT
THAT OUR NAME DOESN'T SEEM TO,
YOU KNOW,
DO ANYTHING WITH DATING SERVICE.
WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT IT,
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.
"HEY, I GOT AN EVERYTHING BAGEL
TODAY!"
[ Disappointed ] "TODAY,
I GOT A STALE BAGEL TODAY."
IT'S LIKE A CODE FOR THEM.
[ CHUCKLES ]
OH.
THAT'S CLEVER.
SO, TELL US
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.
Arum:
OUR CORE SERVICE IS FREE,
BUT THERE IS PREMIUM FEATURES
THAT YOU CAN UNLOCK
USING VIRTUAL CURRENCY
IN THE FORM OF COFFEE BEANS.
LIKE WHAT?
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ITEMS
WE HAVE
IS CALLED OPEN SESAME.
WE ACTUALLY TELL YOU
HOW MANY MUTUAL FRIENDS
YOU HAVE BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR MATCH,
BUT WE DON'T TELL YOU
WHO THEY ARE.
WHAT GOOD IS THAT?
O'Leary: WELL, YOU BUY IT.
IT'S THE MYSTERY,
RIGHT?
YOU BUY IT.
Arum: IT'S THE MYSTERY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW,
"HOW AM I CONNECTED
TO THIS PERSON?"
AND HOW MUCH DO I PAY
FOR THE COFFEE BEANS?
EACH BEAN IS EQUIVALENT
TO ABOUT 2 CENTS,
BUT OPEN SESAME, FOR EXAMPLE,
IT'S 95 BEANS.
DO BOTH PARTIES HAVE TO LIKE
EACH OTHER TO BE A MATCH?
EXACTLY. SO, THIS HAS TO BE
A MUTUAL CONSENT.
AND HOW DO YOU CURATE?
SO, WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY
MISSION LEARNING ALGORITHM
THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION
ALL THE USERS' DATA.
AND WE REQUIRE ALL USERS
TO SIGN UP THROUGH FACEBOOK.
SO, INSTANTLY, FROM DAY ONE,
WE CAN LEARN
A LOT ABOUT THE USER,
INCLUDING THEIR FRIENDS.
BUT YOU ONLY SOURCE
FROM FACEBOOK.
YOU DON'T USE
A QUESTIONNAIRE.
WE DON'T DO ANY OF THAT
RIGHT NOW.
SO, IT LITERALLY TAKES, LIKE,
LESS THAN A MINUTE TO SIGN UP.
THE IDEA IS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
MAKE SOMEONE
GO THROUGH
THE APPLICATION PROCESS.
Herjavec: THE FORM.
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION.
HAVE YOU MET THE MAN
OF YOUR DREAMS?
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO, ARUM HERE IS MARRIED
WITH A GUY THAT SHE MET
LONG, LONG TIME AGO.
YES.
I MET MY CURRENT BOYFRIEND
ON COFFEE MEETS BAGEL.
YOU SEE THE PICTURES
OF THE TWO OF US ON THE WALL.
I'M MEETING A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,
INTERESTING PEOPLE
THROUGH
COFFEE MEETS BAGEL.
AND I'M STILL LOOKING.
ALL RIGHT.
HOW MANY USERS?
SO, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE
SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND USERS.
OUR BUSINESS
REALLY RAMPED UP --
IS IT 200,000
OR IS IT 700,000?
SO, IT'S BETWEEN
100,000 AND 500,000.
Corcoran:
100,000 AND 500,000 WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US
WHAT IT IS?
YOU WANT AN INVESTMENT,
YOU CAN'T NOT TELL US.
YES, BUT I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD RANGE.
IT GIVES YOU A GOOD IDEA.
NO, IT DOESN'T.
NO, BUT WHY WON'T YOU GIVE US
THE ACTUAL NUMBER?
WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT SHARING
THE EXACT USER NUMBER
RIGHT NOW
FOR COMPETITIVE --
OKAY, I'M OUT.
I'M OUT.
YOU'VE GOT TO SHARE THAT.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
OKAY.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES?
SO, LAST YEAR,
WE MADE $87,000.
BUT GET THIS --
THIS YEAR,
IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS,
WE MADE $270,000.
WOW.
SO, IT'S GROWING
VERY QUICKLY.
WHAT DO YOU FORECAST
FOR THIS CALENDAR YEAR, ALL-IN?
AT THIS CURRENT RATE,
WE WILL MAKE $1 MILLION.
IMPRESSIVE.
AND NEXT YEAR,
WE AIM TO MAKE
$10 MILLION.
ALL RIGHT, FROM
THE MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES,
WHAT WILL YOU MAKE?
WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
OUR PROFIT IS NEGATIVE
BECAUSE WE HAD TO SPEND
A LOT OF MONEY,
MOSTLY ON SALARIES,
TO PAY OUR DEVELOPERS.
AND DO YOU GUYS TAKE A SALARY
TODAY?
RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE $100,000 SALARY EACH.
EACH?
WOW.
SORRY.
YOU TAKE $100,000 EACH?
SO $300,000 YOU'RE DRAWING OUT
OF THE BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.
Soo: A YEAR.
Arum: A YEAR.
BUT THAT IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT
PAY CUT FOR ALL OF US,
WHATEVER
WE WERE MAKING PRIOR.
Herjavec: [ LAUGHS ]
WE ACTUALLY RAISED $2.8 MILLION
IN EXTERNAL FUNDING SO FAR.
WOW.
HOW?
OUR NOTABLE INVESTOR, ACTUALLY,
IS ONE OF THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF Match.com,
WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVED OUR IDEA.
AND HE WAS
OUR VERY FIRST INVESTOR.
ON THE $1 MILLION, HOW MUCH
WILL YOU LOSE THIS YEAR?
WE'LL LOSE $1 MILLION.
YOU'LL LOSE $1 MILLION ON
$1 MILLION IN SALES THIS YEAR?
YES. WHICH IS WHY WE ACTUALLY
HAVE TO RAISE MORE MONEY
BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO RAMP UP
OUR GROWTH.
YOU'RE PROJECTING $10 MILLION
FOR THE SECOND YEAR.
EXACTLY.
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU MAKE
ON THAT $10 MILLION?
WE WILL BREAK EVEN
ON $10 MILLION.
YOU'LL BREAK EVEN
ON $10 MILLION?
WOW.
LET HER GO. LET HER GO.
GO AHEAD. TELL US.
Dawoon: HERE'S WHY.
WE PLAN TO BRING ON
ABOUT 4 MILLION USERS NEXT YEAR,
WHICH IS GOING TO GENERATE
ABOUT $2.50 EACH,
HENCE THE $10 MILLION.
AND WHAT'S YOUR
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST?
30 CENTS.
NEXT YEAR, WE PLAN ON SPENDING
ABOUT $3 MILLION TO $4 MILLION
ON MARKETING SPENDING
AND ACQUIRE 4 MILLION USERS.
SO, WE ARE ASSUMING
A SLIGHT INCREASE
IN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST.
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE AN ALL-OR-NOTHING PLAY.
WHY DO YOU THINK
WE'RE ALL-OR-NOTHING?
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOSING
SO MUCH MONEY.
YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN
THE "BUILDING A BUSINESS" GAME,
YOU'RE IN THE "RAISING MONEY
AND GETTING USERS" GAME.
I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO HIT
A HOME RUN.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO, BUT IT'S RISKY.
I'M OUT.
IT IS OUR DECISION
TO INVEST MORE NOW
SO WE CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH,
BUT WE CAN JUST AS WELL
JUST GROW THIS BUSINESS AS IS.
THAT'S THE FASCINATING
DILEMMA, 'CAUSE I HEAR
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.
THE BASELINE MODEL WORKS.
YOU WANT TO POUR GASOLINE
ON THAT FIRE.
EXACTLY.
IT'S A PRETTY BIG BET.
AND WHILE I'M DOING IT, I PART
WITH $500,000 AND I GET 5%.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS FOR ME NOW
ON "SHARK TANK" IN SEASON 6 IS,
I'VE COME TO REALIZE
I'M REALLY VALUABLE.
BIG TIME.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AND IT'S MADE ME
VERY GREEDY.
I DON'T DO 5% DEALS.
THAT'S WORTHLESS TO ME.
I WOULDN'T DO THIS.
I'M OUT.
IF WE REALLY THOUGHT THIS
WAS ALL-OR-NOTHING,
WE WOULD HAVE RAISED A LOT
MORE MONEY FROM THE BEGINNING.
NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CHOICE
OF JUST GROWING
THE BUSINESS TRADITIONALLY
OR RAISE MORE MONEY
TO MAKE THIS BIG.
YOU'VE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY,
AND YOU'RE NOT MAKING MONEY,
AND YOU'RE EACH
DRAWING $100,000 --
THAT'S $300,000
OUT OF THE BUSINESS.
THAT SEEMS
VERY HIGH SALARY.
I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE DON'T MAKE
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT.
AND YOU'RE JUST GROWING.
BIG CONCERN I HAVE, ALSO,
IS THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
COULD DO THIS.
PEOPLE ARE KNOCKING OFF
EVERYBODY
ON THE INTERNET
ALL THE TIME.
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
I THINK ONE THING FOR SURE IS
YOU ARE GREAT AT RAISING MONEY.
THANK YOU.
I ALSO THINK
THIS IS A SITE THAT'S NEEDED.
I THINK THE WOMEN I KNOW THAT
HAVE BEEN ON THE TYPICAL WEBSITE
FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT
IN A MEAT LOCKER.
EXACTLY.
TOTALLY.
THEY'RE LOOKED OVER.
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALMOST INSULTING.
YES.
THIS IS A SITE THAT GIVES WOMEN
A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTROL.
AND I LIKE ALL OF THAT.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I DON'T LIKE --
THE BREAK EVEN AT $10 MILLION.
A BREAK EVEN!
AND I'M ONLY OWNING
5% OF THE STOCK.
THAT'S SPOOKY.
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
ENOUGH UP-SIDE
FOR THE ENORMOUS RISK
I'D BE TAKING.
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
IF I OFFERED YOU $30 MILLION
FOR THE COMPANY,
WOULD YOU TAKE IT?
Narrator:
ALL FIVE SHARKS ARE OUT,
BUT MARK CUBAN HAS JUST MADE
THE LARGEST OFFER
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY.
Cuban: LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.
I IF I OFFERED YOU
$30 MILLION FOR THE COMPANY,
WOULD YOU TAKE IT?
NO.
OKAY.
I WOULD NOT BE TAKING IT
BECAUSE WE SEE --
WE SEE THIS BUSINESS GROWING
AS BIG AS Match.com.
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH REVENUE
THEY ARE GENERATING?
$800 MILLION A YEAR.
THEY'RE BECOMING A
BILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE COMPANY.
AND WE THINK THIS MODEL
AND THE PRODUCT
HAS POTENTIAL TO BE
AS BIG AS MATCH.
HE OFFERED YOU $30 MILLION,
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH.
Cuban:
SHE SHOULD FEEL CONFIDENT.
IT'S A NEWER EPHEMERAL VERSION
OF HOT OR NOT,
WHICH IS BRILLIANT.
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW PROTECTABLE THAT IS.
WHILE I GIVE YOU
TOTAL CREDIT
AND I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE DONE
SOME BRILLIANT THINGS,
I DON'T THINK THE RISK/REWARD
IS THERE FOR ME,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M STILL OUT.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
O'Leary:
EXCELLENT PRESENTATION.
Arum:
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY --
LIKE IN DATING, NEVER SETTLE.
WHILE $30 MILLION MAY SOUND LIKE
A LOT OF MONEY,
YOU WAIT, MR. MARK CUBAN,
BECAUSE THIS BABY
IS GOING TO EXPLODE.
Narrator: IN SEASON 5,
PETE HAMBORG, HIS SON, GUS,
AND THEIR COUSIN DONNIE SANDUSKY
INTRODUCED THE SHARKS
TO THEIR SKATEBOARDING
INNOVATION.
$300,000, 30%.
ROBERT, WE WANT TO DO BUSINESS
WITH YOU.
ALL RIGHT!
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
"SHARK TANK" IS THE BEST
THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
TO OUR BUSINESS.
IN THE YEAR LEADING UP
TO OUR PITCH,
WE HAD DONE ABOUT $225,000
IN SALES.
A YEAR AFTER "SHARK TANK,"
OUR TOTAL SALES HAVE EXCEEDED
$1 MILLION.
WE'RE PROUD TO SAY
WE'RE CONTINUING
TO MAKE OUR PRODUCTS
BY HAND
HERE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH,
CALIFORNIA.
THE COMPANY'S GROWING
PRETTY MUCH AS FAST
AS WE CAN HANDLE IT.
WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR WAREHOUSE SPACE,
WE'VE ADDED
THREE NEW EMPLOYEES,
AND WE'VE BUILT A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERNET WEB STORE.
HEY, GUYS!
HEY!
HEY!
PETE, DONNIE, AND GUS
ARE KILLING IT.
$1 MILLION IN SALES
IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME -- IT'S INCREDIBLE.
YOU KNOW, NEXT STEP
IS $2 MILLION, $3 MILLION.
WE JUST GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL
WITH INVENTORY CONTROL.
Sandusky:
ROBERT AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN
WONDERFUL BUSINESS PARTNERS
AND COACHES.
THEY SET US UP ON A CLEAR PATH
TO GROW RESPONSIBLY,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEEDED.
HEY, CAN WE GO TRY THEM
ON THE BEACH?
LET'S DO IT.
Pete: WE DO STREET SURFING
BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
AND WHAT
WE'VE INADVERTENTLY DONE
IS WE'VE STARTED
A WHOLE NEW SPORT --
STREET STAND-UP PADDLING.
WE'RE ON THE GROUND FLOOR
OF A MOVEMENT THAT'S STARTING.
GOSH.
YEP, THIS LOOKS GREAT.
THANK YOU.
BECAUSE OF "SHARK TANK,"
WE'RE STRONGER AS A FAMILY
AND AS A BUSINESS.
WE WOULDN'T TRADE IT
FOR ANYTHING.
Herjavec:
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CAN START
A BUSINESS WITH YOUR KIDS
AND BUILD
A MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS,
THAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM.
THAT'S WHAT "SHARK TANK"
IS ALL ABOUT.
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE PART
OF THEIR DREAM.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A PRODUCT DESIGNED
TO MAKE WOMEN LOOK
CLASSY AND SEXY.
