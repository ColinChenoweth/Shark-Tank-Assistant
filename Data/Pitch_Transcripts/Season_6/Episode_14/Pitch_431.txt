I'M ELLIE.
I'M BECCA.
AND WE ARE SISTERS
AND BEST FRIENDS.
GROWING UP, ELLIE AND I
WERE ATTACHED AT THE HIP.
AND THEN WE, YOU KNOW, GOT
MARRIED, HAD OUR OWN FAMILIES.
THIS BUSINESS HAS AFFORDED US
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO PURSUE A DREAM TOGETHER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE
DOTS AND THE CHEVRON TOGETHER?
LOVE IT.
WE'VE CREATED A PRODUCT
THAT'S THE PERFECT ACCESSORY
TO ADD FUN TO ANY EVENT.
WHO WANTS SOME CAKE?!
[ CHILDREN SCREAM PLAYFULLY ]
WE LIKE TO SAY THAT
WE TAKE FUN SERIOUSLY.
GIMME A KISS,
GIMME A KISS.
AND IN AN ALL-TOO-SERIOUS
WORLD,
OUR PRODUCT WILL REALLY
PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.
I NEED SOME WATER ON IT.
HAVE SOMEBODY LICK YOU.
ULTIMATELY,
WE'VE SACRIFICED A LOT.
WE'VE PUT IN $180,000.
WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF QUALITY
TIME FROM OUR FAMILIES.
IT'S BEEN HARD, BUT WE KNOW
IT'S WORTH IT.
WE JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP
TO GET OUR NAME OUT THERE
AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE
EVERYWHERE.
[ LAUGHS ]
HEY THERE, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ELLIE BROWN.
AND I'M HER SISTER,
BECCA NELSON.
WE'RE ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR A 30% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR BUSINESS,
evREwares.
HANG ON TO YOUR NOTEBOOKS,
SHARKS,
'CAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
WHERE YOU CAN STICK IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
WEARABLE FABRIC
STICKER ACCESSORIES
THAT ADD INSTANT FUN
TO ANY OCCASION,
LIKE OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT,
THE STICKY TIE.
WELL, BASICALLY A STICKY TIE
MAKES AN ORDINARY T-SHIRT
EXTRAORDINARY.
[ PEELS ]
HUH.
THEY'RE REUSABLE,
THEY WON'T TEAR,
OR LOSE THEIR SHAPE.
PLAIN WHITE T-SHIRT...
PARTY SHIRT.
[ LAUGHS ]
PLAIN WHITE T-SHIRT...
INSTANT BLACK TIE FORMAL.
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO SPILL
SOMETHING ON THEM,
THEY CAN BE WIPED CLEAN
AND WORN AGAIN
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
OKAY, BACK TO BUSINESS.
Robert: [ LAUGHS ]
[ CLEARING THROAT ]
SHARKS, WE HAVE SOME SAMPLES
THAT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER
HERE YOU ARE, ROBERT.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
KEVIN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU GOT IT. BARBARA.
THANK YOU, ELLIE.
Ellie: AND MARK.
I LOVE THIS.
NICE.
WHAT DOES IT SAY, LORI?
IT SAYS, "I'M A HERO,
NOT A ZERO."
HEY, LORI, "KISS ME,
I'M CROATIAN."
[ LAUGHTER ]
COME ON, LORI --
THAT'S CUTE!
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S KEVIN ON MONEY.
I LOVE IT. I REALLY LIKE THAT.
THIS IS GONNA BE
YOUR BEST SELLER,
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
Lori: VERY CUTE.
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT.
WHAT ARE THE SALES, BECCA?
SO TO DATE, WE HAVE ABOUT
$600,000 IN SALES.
UM, FROM 2011
THROUGH 2014 --
HOW ABOUT THIS YEAR?
WHAT ABOUT THIS CALENDAR YEAR?
THIS YEAR IS
A DIFFERENT YEAR FOR US.
UH-OH.
THIS IS -- THIS IS
WHY WE ARE HERE.
LAST YEAR WE HAD
MAJOR TRACTION.
WE LITERALLY WENT UP
TO $300,000.
WE SOLD INTO PARTY CITY,
THE CONTAINER STORE,
STEIN MART --
AND THEN TRAGEDY STRUCK.
Lori: ARE YOU STILL
IN THOSE STORES?
I JUST HAVE TO ASK.
NOT TRAGEDY.
WELL, WE STRUGGLED WITH
THE RATE OF SELL-THROUGH,
UM, BECAUSE IT'S SUCH
A BRAND-NEW CONCEPT.
THAT'S PART OF THE GLORY
OF IT,
BUT IT'S ALSO
A CONSUMER-AWARENESS ISSUE.
IT GOT DELISTED.
THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT
OFF THE SHELVES.
IT'S ACTUALLY
SELLING THROUGH,
JUST NOT AT THE SPEED
THAT THEY WOULD REORDER.
SO WHAT WILL YOUR SALES BE
THIS YEAR?
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON PACE TO DO
ABOUT $50,000 THIS YEAR.
D'OH!
WHOA!
BUT LIST-- BUT WE HAVEN'T
GOTTEN TO --
HERE'S THE DEAL.
PULL UP! PULL UP!
WE ARE TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT, GUYS.
WE WENT BACK IN.
WE REDID ALL --
I THINK THE MARKET HAS SPOKEN.
THEY DON'T LIKE IT.
I DON'T THINK SO. BECAUSE --
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
WHY ARE YOUR SALES
ONLY $50,000 THIS YEAR?
BECAUSE WE MADE
A CONSCIOUS DECISION
AT THE END OF THE YEAR
TO SLOW OUR ENGINES DOWN
AND FIGURE IT OUT.
WE DECIDED TO -- TO --
TO TAKE OUR FOOT OFF THE GAS.
NO!
HOLD ON,
NOT COMPLETELY OFF THE GAS.
REGROUP.
WE HAD TO.
BECAUSE IT WAS TIME
FOR 2014 TO BEGIN,
IT'S GO FAST,
MAKE YOUR CATALOG,
YOU DO THIS, GET THIS,
SPEND ALL THE MONEY GOING
TO THE TRADE SHOWS.
BECCA, IT'S NOT WORKING.
THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU -- YOU PUT IT OUT THERE.
YEP.
YOU HAD DECREASING SALES
YEAR AFTER YEAR.
YOU'RE DOWN TO 50--
DECREASING?
WELL, COME ON, YOU'RE DOWN
TO $50,000.
THAT WAS BECAUSE
WE CHOSE TO DO THAT.
WE COULD HAVE GONE OUT
AND SEEN --
NOBODY CHOOSES TO SEE
A BUSINESS DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.
WHEN YOU ARE SELF --
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE FROM THE SOUTH,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAY
IN THE SOUTH?
"OH, BLESS HIS HEART.
HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT."
YEAH, BLESS HIS HEART,
THEN KICK HIS BUTT.
YOU'RE GOING TO ZERO!
OKAY, WELL, LET ME JUST
TELL YOU.
CAN I ASK YOU --
I HAVE QUESTIONS.
ASK HER IF SHE'S GOING TO ZERO.
WHAT DOES THIS TIE SELL FOR
AT THE RETAIL LEVEL?
CURRENTLY, THEY'VE BEEN
SELLING FROM $4.99
ALL THE WAY UP TO $7.99.
FOR ONE TIE?
FOR ONE TIE.
FOR ONE TIE. THAT'S RIGHT.
Mark: OH!
NO!
WHY ARE THE COSTS SO HIGH?
IT IS HIGH.
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN REUSE
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS
A PREMIUM STICKER PRODUCT.
BECCA, JUST TELL US
WHAT IT COSTS YOU TO MAKE IT.
WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO 50 CENTS,
PACKAGED AND READY TO GO.
EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW THIS IS MADE.
THE, UM, MATERIAL --
IT HAPPENS TO BE
THROUGH AN EXCLUSIVE
SUPPLIER OF THIS MATERIAL.
IT'S PATENTED, AND SO WE HAVE
AN AGREEMENT WITH THIS SUPPLIER.
YOU'RE THE MOST EXPENSIVE
STICKER IN THE PARTY STORE.
I'M NOT GONNA PAY THAT KIND
OF PRICE FOR SOMETHING
I KNOW I'M THROWING OUT
IN THE MORNING.
I'M GONNA GET STICKERS
FOR 99 CENTS.
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
SOMETHING THAT IN THE END
IS PEELING OFF,
NOT STAYING STUCK.
AND YOU'VE NEVER BOUGHT
A WEARABLE STICKER --
I DON'T CARE.
I'M THROWING IT OUT.
IT'S DEAD, IT'S GONE.
NOBODY CARES.
I THINK 99% OF THE MARKET
DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT LASTS
A LIFETIME. WHO CARES?
YOU KNOW, SEVERAL YEARS BACK,
I INVESTED IN SOMETHING
VERY SIMILAR.
AND IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT.
PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO REUSE
THESE THINGS.
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.
I'M OUT.
I LOOK AT YOU,
ELLIE AND BECCA,
AS ENTREPRENEURS
THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH
A 3-YEAR PROCESS.
THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND ON IT,
THE MORE YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR PRODUCTIVE TIME.
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH
AND YOU'VE PROVEN
THAT YOU CAN BUILD BUSINESSES.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
A BETTER IDEA.
THIS IS A HOWLING DOG FROM HELL.
I'M OUT.
[ GASPS ] OKAY --
DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH.
I RESPECT YOUR OPINION,
BUT WE REALLY DO --
YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME.
I'M LI--
I'M YOUR FRIEND HERE.
WE WANT TO BE SPONGES.
WE WANT TO LEARN FROM YOU GUYS.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED ENOUGH
FROM YOUR THREE YEARS OF ISSUES.
Barbara: LADIES.
YES?
YOU LOVE DESIGNING, BUT YOUR
EYE'S NOT ON THE BUSINESS.
WORK WITH US. TEACH US.
WE'LL LEARN.
I'M OUT.
Robert:
[ CLICKS TONGUE ] ELLIE, BECCA.
REUSABLE, REWEARABLE,
TEAR-PROOF, RESIDUE-FREE --
NOBODY CARES.
I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU,
ROBERT.
DO YOU HAVE A WEB SITE
AND DO YOU SELL ONLINE?
WE DO.
'CAUSE YOUR NAME SUCKS.
Both: [ LAUGH ]
WHAT, evREwares?
'CAUSE YOU CAN REWEAR ---
YEAH.
Kevin: I THOUGHT OF GLASSES.
Robert: WE ARE SO POSITIVE
TODAY.
IT'S FANTASTIC BEING HERE,
GUYS. UM...
THIS IS SO AMAZING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE REALIZE THAT WE'VE
HIT A HURDLE,
AND WE'RE WANTING
TO JUMP OVER IT.
WE'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN
DOING IT.
WE LOVE --
OKAY, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
OKAY.
$200,000...
FOR THE ENTIRE BUSINESS.
MNH.
OKAY, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
OKAY.
$200,000...
FOR THE ENTIRE BUSINESS.
MNH.
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE LOST.
RIGHT?
YOU GUYS ARE DESIGNERS.
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE,
I'LL CONTRACT YOU GUYS.
YOU'VE GOT A NICE LITTLE
SETUP BUSINESS.
YOU'VE GOT ACCESS TO RETAIL.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
BUT I THINK BY LOSING US,
IN THE PROCESS,
YOU'RE --
YOU'RE LOSING PART OF --
I CAN STILL CONTRACT YOU
FOR YOUR DESIGNS.
MARK, CAN'T YOU SET THIS UP
YOURSELF FOR 100 GRAND?
WHAT DO YOU NEED THIS --
ANY OF THIS FOR?
NO, IT WOULD COST ME MORE
THAN THAT TO SET IT ALL UP.
WHY?
CAN WE CHAT FOR A BRIEF SECOND?
SURE.
OKAY, THANKS.
WOW, I WOULD NOT CHAT TOO LONG.
ARE YOU NUTS?
THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP.
MARK, IT IS A TOUGH BUSINESS.
IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP!
OH, I KNOW, BUT I CAN JUST
USE IT FOR JUST MAVERICKS STUFF.
OH, IT'S CRAP!
YOU COULD DO THIS FOR 50 GRAND.
IT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL.
IT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL.
[ LAUGHS ] WE'RE -- IT'S
$200,000 AND WE'RE DONE.
BUT YOU HEAR THE FEEDBACK
WE GOT.
WOW, GOSH. I DON'T KNOW.
[ CHUCKLES ]
OKAY.
WE COULD BE HOME MORE
WITH OUR KIDS
AND PAY ATTENTION TO THEM AGAIN.
I KNOW.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
Y'ALL...
GOSH!
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DOING AS WE'RE WALKING IN HERE.
[ FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ]
UM --
SEE --
HOLD --
I JUST WANT TO SET THE TABLE.
OKAY.
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY INTERESTING
MOMENT IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY.
EVERYBODY HATES YOUR BUSINESS
AND PASSED.
THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO GIVE AWAY
OUR COMPANY FOR $200,000?
THEN MARK LOOKED AT YOU
AND SAID, "LOOK,
"YOU HAVE NO VALUE TO ME
IN THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION,
BUT I'LL BUY
THE WHOLE BUSINESS."
MM-HMM.
SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION --
$200,000
FOR THE WHOLE BUSINESS,
PASS EVERYTHING OVER TO MARK
TO RUN IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
[ MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY ]
WELL, I FEEL A REALLY
GREAT SADNESS RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO
LOVE THIS.
WE'VE PUT A LOT INTO IT.
UM...
WE HAVE A TON TO OFFER.
SO...
WE -- BECAUSE WE DO
EVERYTHING.
I'M REALLY TEARING UP.
I KNOW. FROM --
Robert: ELLIE --
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO LET IT GO.
I'M ONE OF THOSE STUPID PEOPLE
WHO CRIED ON TV.
I CRIED ON NATIONAL TV.
BUSINESS IS TOUGH. TEARS ARE NOT
GONNA HAVE ANY VALUE --
HANG ON, KEVIN --
I DON'T WANT YOUR SYMPATHY.
Lori: THEY'RE PEOPLE.
Robert: KEVIN, LET THEM TALK.
COME ON!
LET THEM TALK!
I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG
MOMENT, RIGHT?
LIKE, THIS HAS BEEN
THREE YEARS OF, YOU KNOW --
I THINK MY DAUGHTER
WAS IN --
SHE WAS 4
WHEN WE STARTED THIS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE HER FIR--
WHAT--
OHH.
IT'S JUST,
WE'VE DONE A LOT, AND --
AND WE KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT THIS, AND IT'S --
WE'VE COME SO FAR.
AND WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH.
TO HAVE THAT MANY RETAILERS
TO SAY, "WE LOVE YOU,"
AND YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT.
HOW CAN THEY BE WRONG?
BECCA.
YES?
I HAVE TOTAL RESPECT
FOR WHAT YOU'VE --
SO I JUST HAD TO --
I HAD TO VENT.
WE JUST HAD TO GET IT
OFF OUR CHEST.
IT'S YOUR BABY
AND I RESPECT THAT, THAT'S WHY
I HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.
IT'S NOT AN EASY DECISION,
AND I RESPECT THAT.
IT'S NOT.
IS IT TIME TO LET OUR BABY GO?
I THINK IT IS.
[ SNIFFLES ]
WE'LL DO IT.
OKAY.
Sharks: WOW.
Lori: OHH!
Robert: OHH!
Lori: OH, THEY'RE CRYING.
Robert: I FEEL SO --
Kevin: BETTER THAN NOTHING.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS
THE GOOD NEWS, RIGHT?
IF I CAN TAKE THIS AND REALLY
TURN IT INTO SOMETHING,
I PROMISE TO TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOUR BABY
AND DO THE BEST I CAN
TO RAISE IT
FROM THE DEAD AND TURN IT
INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL.
Ellie and Becca: THANK YOU.
OKAY?
THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THANKS.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA
BE DOING 24 HOURS FROM NOW?
CRYING BIG TEARS OF RELIEF,
AND YOU'RE GONNA APPRECIATE
THAT YOU GAVE YOUR KID
TO A GREAT GUY.
I SOLD MY COMPANY
FOR $5.7 BILLION...
I KNOW.
AND I WAS SAD WHEN I SOLD IT...
FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE DIFFERENT, MARK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MARK.
GREAT ENDING. WOW.
WE JUST CRIED...A LOT.
WE JUST CRIED. [ LAUGHS ]
THE LAST THING
I EXPECTED TO DO
WAS TO WALK AWAY FROM
THE COMPANY, AND I STILL --
I'M GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME
SLEEPING TONIGHT. [ CHUCKLES ]
IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW WHAT
TO DO IN THAT MOMENT, BUT --
BUT WE'RE EXCITED.
YEAH.
CAN'T YOU SEE?
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE IT GO --
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED --
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
TO SEE IT GO SOMEWHERE.
