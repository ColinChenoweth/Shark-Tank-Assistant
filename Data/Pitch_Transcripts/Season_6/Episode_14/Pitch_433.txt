HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M JUSTIN KOEHNEKE.
AND I'M SETH FRIEDMAN,
AND WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF BOTTLE BRIGHT.
WE'RE HERE TODAY SEEKING
$75,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, THERE ARE ALL KINDS
OF PORTABLE DRINKING CONTAINERS
THAT MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER.
THE PROBLEM IS, THEY DEVELOP
STAINS AND ODORS EASILY.
AND THE TYPICAL METHODS
FOR CLEANING THEM
JUST DON'T WORK WELL.
DISHWASHERS CAN'T SPRAY
INTO NARROW OPENINGS,
AND MANY DRINKING CONTAINERS
AREN'T DISHWASHER-SAFE.
CHLORINE BLEACH
AND OTHER HARSH CHEMICALS
ARE TOXIC AND DANGEROUS.
WE WERE FRUSTRATED BY
THE LACK OF SUITABLE METHODS
TO CLEAN OUR PORTABLE
DRINKWEAR.
WE WERE LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION
THAT WAS EASY TO USE,
SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE.
THAT'S WHY WE CREATED
BOTTLE BRIGHT.
BOTTLE BRIGHT IS AN EFFERVESCENT
CLEANING TABLET
THAT IS <i>AMAZING</i>
AT REMOVING STAINS AND ODORS
FROM PORTABLE DRINKWEAR.
AND IT'S SO EASY TO USE.
SIMPLY FILL YOUR BOTTLE
WITH WATER,
DROP IN A BOTTLE BRIGHT TABLET,
AND LET IT GO TO WORK.
THEN DISCARD THE SOLUTION,
GIVE IT A QUICK RINSE,
AND YOUR BOTTLE IS FRESH
AND CLEAN.
SHARKS, WE ARE COMMITTED
TO MAKING BOTTLE BRIGHT
A HOUSEHOLD NAME.
WE NEED YOUR EXPERTISE
IN GETTING OUR UNIQUE PRODUCT
INTO THE HANDS
OF CONSUMERS.
SO, WHO WOULD LIKE
TO JOIN US
IN SOLVING THE DIRTY BOTTLE
DILEMMA?
LET ME PASS OUT SOME SAMPLES
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT.
IT'S LIKE EFFERDENT
FOR YOUR BOTTLE. [ LAUGHS ]
I THINK THE BIGGEST
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT
AND SOMETHING LIKE
EFFERDENT
IS THIS IS AN ALL-NATURAL
PRODUCT.
Lori: ALL-NATURAL.
WHAT'S IN THAT TABLET?
TH-THEY'RE ALL-NATURAL
INGREDIENTS,
BUT THEY'RE ALL MINERAL-BASED
OR ORGANIC-BASED.
DOES IT HAVE ANY ODOR
WHEN I -- AFTERWARDS?
NONE.
ABSOLUTELY NO ODOR
OR RESIDUAL SMELL.
GUYS, I'M GONNA BET THAT
YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE SALES
'CAUSE NOBODY GIVES A DAMN.
[ LAUGHS ] YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I-I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
GIVE A DAMN,
BUT WE HAVE VERY LITTLE SALES.
SO HALF YOUR COMMENT IS CORRECT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TELL US ABOUT YOUR SALES.
Kevin: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
UM, LAST YEAR WE DID
$110,000.
THIS YEAR WE'RE
AT $85,000.
WELL, THAT'S NOT "NO SALES."
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
SETH, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IT?
UH, WE STARTED
THREE YEARS AGO.
WE HAVE
PRIVATE LABEL CUSTOMERS.
WE'RE DEALING WITH TWO
VERY LARGE COMPANIES
THAT WE'RE NOW PRIVATE-LABELING
THIS SAME FORMULA FOR.
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.
WHEN YOU PRIVATE-LABEL IT,
THERE'S NO BRAND FOR YOU.
THEY'RE SIMPLY USING IT
AS PART OF THEIR PRODUCT.
SO I GO TO THEM,
I BUY THE PRODUCT.
YOU COME ALONG WITH IT.
IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH, WE MANUFACTURE FOR THEM.
IT'S UNDER THEIR BRAND.
AND I BET YOU'RE MAKING HUNDREDS
OF DOLLARS DOING THAT.
[ LAUGHING ]
WELL, WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT --
WHAT DOES THE PRODUCT COST?
THE PRODUCT HAS GREAT MARGINS.
YES.
WHAT DOES IT COST, AND WHAT
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
SO WE BUILD THE -- WE BUILD
THE 10-PACK POUCH
RIGHT THERE FOR 79 CENTS.
WE WHOLESALE IT FOR $2.99
TO RETAIL.
AND -- AND -- AND THEN THEY
SELL IT FOR $5.99.
WHAT'S THE REST OF YOUR STORY?
LIKE, WHY DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
SURE.
SO WE'RE MOUNTAIN BIKERS.
AND WE FINISHED A DAY
OF MOUNTAIN BIKING.
WE USE HYDRATION PACKS
MUCH LIKE YOU SEE THERE
WITH THE HOSE, AND I FINISHED
THAT RIDE THAT DAY,
PULLED UP TO THE TRAIL HEAD
AND SAID TO JUSTIN,
"THIS THING TASTES DISGUSTING."
'CAUSE THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE
TO CLEAN.
SO WE HAD THAT ISSUE.
I SAID TO JUSTIN,
"I'M LEADING
A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE,
"AND I'M DUMPING BLEACH
IN HERE.
"AND NOW IT TASTES LIKE
A SWIMMING POOL
"AND I'M KILLING MYSELF.
LET'S COME UP WITH
AN ALL-NATURAL SOLUTION."
SO JUST TO GO BACK, YOU DID
$110,000 IN SALES.
MM-HMM.
PRIVATE LABEL TO TWO COMPANIES.
YES.
DID YOU MAKE ANY MONEY
ON THAT?
WE DID NOT. WE HAD A ROUGH 2013,
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU.
OKAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WE HAD A $100,000 LOSS
THAT YEAR.
WHOA!
LAST YEAR, ABOUT, UH,
JULY 2013,
WE DID A LARGE RUN FOR ONE OF
OUR PRIVATE LABEL COMPANIES.
AND WE WERE TRYING TO PUSH
THE BOUNDARIES
OF ECOLOGICAL PACKAGING.
THEY WANTED A FILM THAT WAS
BIODEGRADABLE.
WE SENT THEM
A LARGE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT,
AND THERE WAS MOISTURE VAPOR
THAT WAS STARTING TO
PENETRATE THROUGH THE PRODUCT
AND DEGRADE THE TABLETS.
SO YOU DID A RECALL?
YOU TOOK IT BACK?
WE REPLACED IT. WE TOOK IT BACK.
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST
TO TAKE THE ENTIRE THING BACK --
AND YOU LOST $100,000
ON THAT.
PAINFUL YEAR.
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY
YOU'VE MET ME TODAY,
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY.
I'M ALSO A CLEANER.
I'M THE WONDERFUL CLEANER.
I CLEAN REALLY BAD IDEAS
RIGHT OUT OF THE SHARK TANK,
AND THIS FALLS UNDER
THAT CATEGORY.
YOU SPENT OVER THREE YEARS
DOING THIS,
IT'S STILL NOT PROFITABLE,
AND YET YOU CLAIM
YOU'RE ENTREPRENEURS.
AT SOME POINT,
A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR KNOWS
THEY HAVE A LOSER,
AND THEY SHOOT IT.
KEVIN, I SENSE YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE AN OFFER.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OFFER
TO THINK IT THROUGH,
LEAVE HERE, AND SHOOT IT.
BY THE WAY, I'M OUT.
SETH, HERE'S MY -- HERE'S
MY CHALLENGE WITH IT. LOOK.
YOU HAVEN'T PROVEN ANY DEMAND.
I THINK ANYBODY THAT TRULY CARES
ENOUGH ABOUT CLEANING
THEIR WATER BOTTLE
ALREADY HAS AN OPTION.
YOU'RE DOING IT BETTER
POTENTIALLY,
BUT THAT IS GONNA BE
A REAL CHALLENGE
TO GET THAT CONSUMER
TO CARE THAT MUCH MORE.
I -- WHEN YOU'RE SPENDING $40 --
I DON'T SEE THE DIRECTION.
I UNDERSTAND.
I'M OUT.
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN TO DO
WITH THE $75,000?
WHY DO YOU NEED IT?
$75,000 WE FEEL
IS HELPFUL FOR ADMINISTRATION.
TO ME, THE WORST WASTE OF MONEY
IS FOR IT TO GO
TO ADMINISTRATION
WHEN YOU'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE THAT
SHOULD BE REAL FIRECRACKERS
OUT THERE, YOU KNOW,
BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL,
WORKING MORNING, NOON,
AND NIGHT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
IF YOU WERE TO INVEST WITH US,
I'D BE COMPLETELY OPEN-MINDED
TO ANY IDEA YOU HAD AND WHAT
WE SHOULD DO WITH THAT MONEY.
THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE HERE
THAT IS VERY DISTURBING TO ME.
I THINK YOU CREATED A...
AN ENORMOUS MISTRUST
IN MY MIND WHEN YOU SAID
YOU LOST $100,000 IN YEAR 3.
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH LOSING
$100,000 IN YEAR 1,
BUT THEN EVERYBODY LIKES TO SEE
SALES START TO GET SOME TRACTION
AND GO UP.
I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
YOU HAD A GREAT IDEA.
RIGHT?
YOU TURNED IT INTO WHAT LOOKS
LIKE A GOOD PRODUCT.
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE
IS A COMPANY.
AND WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS
YOU COME ACROSS
AS BEING DESPERATE.
RIGHT? EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE SAID
IS LIKE YOU'RE DROWNING
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO PUSH
FOR A LIFELINE.
JUST TO BE CLEAR, IT'S NOT
DESPERATION, IT'S PASSION.
WE HAVE PASSION
FOR THIS PRODUCT.
I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
AND WHEN I SENSE DESPERATION,
THAT'S A HUGE NEGATIVE.
I DON'T INVEST IN DESPERATION.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I DON'T AGREE WITH A LOT OF
THE COMMENTS
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE UP HERE.
UM, I THINK THAT THIS IS
A SOLUTION TO A BIG PROBLEM.
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I HAVE A BIG INITIATIVE WITH
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND RIGHT NOW,
AND I CAN HELP YOU A GREAT DEAL
WITH THAT
AND WITH MANY OTHER RETAILERS
TO GET IN.
SO HERE'S MY OFFER.
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
THE $75,000,
BUT I WANT 35%
AND A CONDITION THAT THE MONEY
WILL GO TOWARDS FUNDING
ALL THE PURCHASE ORDERS.
I DON'T WANT IT TO GO TO ADMIN.
AND I KNOW I HAVE DIRECT
TARGETS FOR US TO GET THIS IN.
IN RETAIL AND ON QVC,
THIS WILL HELP TO GIVE
YOURSELF FREE ADVERTISING
SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT
THE PRODUCT IS
WHEN THEY WALK INTO
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND
AND THEY SEE IT.
SO THAT'S MY OFFER.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE THE OFFER.
THANK YOU. YEAH,
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.
WOULD -- WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO 25%?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO
33 AND 1/3.
FINAL OFFER.
SOUNDS GOOD, LORI.
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.
YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.
AWESOME.
Mark: CONGRATS, GUYS.
Robert:
SHE BELIEVED IN THE PRODUCT.
I HAVE SEEN ALL THE CONTAINERS
THAT PEOPLE ARE CRYING ABOUT.
YES. THERE --
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM
OUT THERE.
QVC SELLS HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF THESE.
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN A LOT
OF BOTTLES.
WE ARE GONNA DO
A GREAT BUSINESS.
THANK YOU. VERY GOOD
TO MEET YOU ALL.
THANKS, GUYS.
YEAH!
YEAH! LORI!
THAT WAS IT! THAT WAS
WHO WE WANTED.
LORI! YEAH.
YOU GET ON THAT CARPET,
AND IT'S YOUR BIG MOMENT,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
KEVIN LOOKS AT YOU
AND HE SAYS,
"THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP."
LORI, IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE SOME MISTAKES.
THIS WAS ONE OF THEM.
[ LAUGHS ]
