CURRENTLY WE HAVE
CHOCOLATE CHIP,
THAT'S MY FAVORITE.
TAYA, I GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GONNA EAT ANOTHER
FIVE OR SIX
BEFORE I MAKE UP MY MIND.
YEAH, YOU WANNA TASTE SOME MORE.
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU.
WOW.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
Both: AH! [ LAUGHING ]
IT'S A HEALTHIER COOKIE,
RIGHT?
YES, IT IS.
BECAUSE YOU'RE USING
WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR,
YOU'RE USING FLAX SEEDS,
ORGANIC SUGAR.
SO YOUR MARKET, REALLY,
IS, LIKE, WHOLE FOODS
OR PLACES THAT --
IT IS. THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE CURRENTLY AT.
WE'RE CURRENTLY IN ABOUT

OF THEIR LOCATIONS.
TAYA, WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
OUR CURRENT SALES SINCE
INCEPTION 14 MONTHS AGO --
$52,000.
TAYA, IT SEEMS LOW TO ME.
TAYA, YOU'RE SELLING IT
FOR HOW MUCH?
I'M JUST SAYING --
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, LEAH.
I DON'T LIKE IT, BECAUSE
THE REASON WE DID THIS --
THERE IS A REASON.
BECAUSE WE WANTED YOU TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN YOUR FOOD.
Leah: THANK YOU.
I DON'T DOUBT YOUR ABILITY
TO, UM, SELL.
I THINK YOU'RE --
YOU'RE BOTH HUSTLING
IN THE MOST POSITIVE WAY.

YOU'RE NOT CRYING ANYMORE
