HELLO. MY NAME IS LEAH.
AND I AM TAYA.
WE ARE TWO MOMS
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON,
AND TOGETHER WE CREATED...
Both: SCRATCH &amp; GRAIN
BAKING COMPANY!
WE ARE HERE SEEKING
$150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
OF OUR BUSINESS.
CURRENTLY, BAKING AT HOME
IS A VERY FLAWED PRODUCTION.
RIGHT. YOU EITHER HAVE
THAT MYSTERY BAG-O'-MIX
OR THAT QUESTIONABLE
TUBE OF DOUGH.
I CAN'T PRONOUNCE
THE INGREDIENTS
ON ANY OF THOSE LABELS, AND THEY
NEVER TASTE QUITE RIGHT.
ALTERNATIVELY, YOU CAN
SPEND HOURS UPON HOURS
BAKING FROM SCRATCH
AT HOME.
WHO HAS THE TIME AND MONEY
FOR THAT?
RIGHT?
RIGHT.
SINCE THERE CURRENTLY IS
NO GOOD OPTION
ON THE MARKET TO MAKE DELICIOUS
HOMEMADE BAKED COOKIES...
SO WE CREATED...
Both: THE COOKIE KIT!
? TA-DA ?
OUR COOKIE KITS MAKE
HOMEMADE BAKING EASY <i>AND</i> FUN.
WE INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGE,
LABEL, NUMBER, AND COLOR-CODE
EACH INGREDIENT SEPARATELY,
MAKING HOMEMADE BAKING
FOOLPROOF.
SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SUPPLY
THE BUTTER AND THE EGG...
AND WE PROVIDE THE REST.
PLUS, THESE COOKIE KITS
INTENTIONALLY MAKE
ONE LARGE COOKIE SHEET
OF 9 TO 12 BIG COOKIES
INSTEAD OF 40.
[ Singsongy ]
AND THEY TASTE AMAZING!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, SHARKS, WHO IS
EXCITED ABOUT THE COOKIE KIT
AND WANTS TO JUMP
IN THIS COOKIE JAR WITH US?
WHAT DO THEY TASTE LIKE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, LET US SHOW YOU!
WE'RE VERY HUNGRY SHARKS.
SO, TAKE A TRAY OF COOKIES.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
TAYA, WHAT FLAVORS DO WE HAVE?
WELL, WE HAVE
SIX DIFFERENT FLAVORS.
CURRENTLY WE HAVE
CHOCOLATE CHIP,
OATMEAL RAISIN,
AND CLASSIC SUGAR,
AND THEN THREE OF OUR SIX
ARE ACTUALLY GLUTEN-FREE.
MMM.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE,
AND I HAVEN'T TRIED THE OTHERS.
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD.
OATMEAL RAISIN.
YES!
IT'S LIKE REAL OATMEAL.
THAT'S MY FAVORITE.
TAYA, I GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GONNA EAT ANOTHER
FIVE OR SIX
BEFORE I MAKE UP MY MIND.
YEAH, YOU WANNA TASTE SOME MORE.
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU.
WOW.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
Both: AH! [ LAUGHING ]
IT'S A HEALTHIER COOKIE,
RIGHT?
YES, IT IS.
BECAUSE YOU'RE USING
WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR,
YOU'RE USING FLAX SEEDS,
ORGANIC SUGAR.
SO YOUR MARKET, REALLY,
IS, LIKE, WHOLE FOODS
OR PLACES THAT --
IT IS. THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE CURRENTLY AT.
WE'RE CURRENTLY IN ABOUT
220 LOCATIONS,
INCLUDING WHOLE FOODS --
UM, SUR LA TABLE.
WE'RE IN ALL 120
OF THEIR LOCATIONS.
AND HOW DID YOU EVEN
COME UP WITH THE IDEA?
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS,
AND ONE OF THEM
CAME TO ME AND SAID, "I WANT TO
MAKE HOMEMADE COOKIES."
SO I WENT TO THE STORE,
I SPENT $40 ON THE INGREDIENTS,
CAME HOME AND SPENT THREE HOURS
MEASURING, BAKING, AND CLEANING.
AND THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART
FOR ME IS I FELT WASTEFUL,
BECAUSE I BARELY USED
ANY OF THOSE INGREDIENTS.
AND I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE GREAT?
IF THERE SOME KIND OF A KIT
THAT HAD
THE BEST INGREDIENTS,
FIGURED OUT FOR ME,
SO IT STILL WAS AN ACTIVITY
TO DO AND STILL FUN,
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO
AND BUY ALL THE INGREDIENTS,
AND I DIDN'T WANT 40 COOKIES
AT THE END OF IT, EITHER.
TAYA, WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
OUR CURRENT SALES SINCE
INCEPTION 14 MONTHS AGO --
$52,000.
TAYA, IT SEEMS LOW TO ME.
YOU KNOW, IT IS, AND...
WE HAD EXPERIENCED A LOT
OF PRODUCTION PROBLEMS.
SO WHEN WE STARTED
THIS BUSINESS,
WE PACKAGED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
THOSE INGREDIENTS BY HAND.
WE STILL HAND-LABEL
EACH ONE OF THOSE BAGS.
SO WE NEED TO AUTOMATE
OUR PROCESS.
TAYA, YOU'RE SELLING IT
FOR HOW MUCH?
THE RETAIL IS
BETWEEN $7 AND $12,
DEPENDING ON THE STORE
THAT YOU BUY THEM FROM.
AND WHAT'S YOUR COST?
AND WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE ONE?
OUR ALL-IN COST...
ALL-IN.
...WITH OUR OVERHEAD
AND EVERYTHING
IS $3.89 CURRENTLY.
OHH!
YEAH, THAT'S
OUR PROBLEM, TOO.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
OOH.
OH!
NOW THE THING THAT WE'VE ALWAYS
LIKED ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
IS THAT IT IS SCALABLE.
SO WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
THAT WE CAN GET MACHINERY --
OKAY, LET'S SCALE IT.
LET'S SAY YOU GET
YOUR $150,000.
MM-HMM.
THE MACHINES THAT WE WANT
WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE
AT LEAST 50,000
8 HOURS A DAY...
WHAT COST?
...FIVE DAYS A WEEK.
INCLUDING OVERHEAD,
WHAT COST?
$2.15.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR PRODUCT
DO YOU SELL ONLINE?
IT'S NOT EVEN 10%.
WHY?
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
BECAUSE IT COSTS $5
TO SHIP A BOX.
WHO IS GONNA BUY A PRODUCT
FOR $8,
LET'S JUST SAY, FOR $5?
THAT IS A REALLY, REALLY
GOOD POINT.
YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT
WOULD REALLY CUT DOWN
ON COSTS FOR YOU TREMENDOUSLY
IS IF EVERYTHING
WERE IN ONE BAG.
LIKE, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING'S
MIXED IN AND IT'S LAYERED.
THAT'LL CUT DOWN
YOUR SHIPPING COSTS, TOO.
I'M JUST SAYING --
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, LEAH.
I DON'T LIKE IT, BECAUSE
THE REASON WE DID THIS --
THERE IS A REASON.
BECAUSE WE WANTED YOU TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN YOUR FOOD.
AND IT DOES MATTER. LIKE, BAKING
FROM SCRATCH IS DIFFERENT.
YOU PUT YOUR EGG
AND YOUR BUTTER AND YOUR SUGAR
AND YOU STIR IT REALLY WELL,
AND THAT EMULSIFIES IT.
AND THEN YOU ADD IN YOUR --
YOUR FLOURS,
AND THAT WAY YOU DON'T
OVER-STIR YOUR FLOUR.
YOU'RE SAYING --
YOU'RE SAYING...
THE PROCESS.
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THEM
IN DIFFERENT TIERS.
RIGHT, EXACTLY.
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE
WHAT MAKES THAT COOKIE
WAY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER
PACKAGED --
I AGREE WITH YOU.
I GET THAT, BUT I'M REALLY
ON THE FENCE WITH YOU,
BECAUSE THE WHOLE BUSINESS
IS ABOUT GETTING
YOUR COST OF GOODS IN THIS
PACKAGE DOWN TO AROUND $1.70.
RIGHT.
GUYS, LET ME SIMPLIFY THINGS
FOR EVERYBODY.
MY IDEA OF BAKING IS GOING...
[ SNIFFS ]
"THAT SMELLS GOOD."
THAT'S GOOD.
WHOMP! RIGHT?
WELL, LOOK AT --
HE'S GOT AN EMPTY PLATE.
TOTALLY GONE.
YAY! YEAH!
I HATED THEM, RIGHT?
YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UM, BUT...
I JUST HAVE NO CLUE,
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
UM, I CAN TELL YOU THE STORY
HOW WE STARTED.
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.
UM, I HAD THIS BAD EXPERIENCE
BAKING WITH MY CHILDREN,
AND I HAVE THIS
GO-GETTER NEIGHBOR,
AND I, UM,
I KNEW SHE WANTED
TO START A BUSINESS.
SO I ACTUALLY SENT HER
THIS RANDOM TEXT MESSAGE
AND SAID, "HEY, UH, YOU WANT
TO START THIS BUSINESS
50/50 WITH ME?"
AND I ACTUALLY SPENT
10 YEARS
IN THE SECURITIES FINANCE
INDUSTRY.
WHEN I HAD MY FIRST CHILD,
I DECIDED
I JUST WASN'T GONNA PUT IN
18 HOURS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
WITH NO LONG-TERM PAYOFF,
SO I ALWAYS WORK.
I'M THE HARDEST WORKER
YOU'LL EVER MEET.
AND IF I'M GONNA PUT IN
THAT TIME, THERE BETTER BE
A BETTER REWARD
AT THE END OF IT, SO...
OH, A CAPITALIST. I LOVE YOU.
WHAT WERE YOU SELLING
IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY?
UH, I WAS ACTUALLY
A FIXED INCOME TRADER,
SO BONDS, ANY KIND OF
FIXED INCOME SECURITY.
REALLY?
NOW HE REALLY LIKES YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT NOW YOU'RE WORKING EVEN MORE
HOURS AND MAKING NO MONEY,
'CAUSE YOUR MARGINS SUCK.
I KNOW, BUT THERE'S
A LONG-TERM PAYOFF ON THIS.
THE FIRST THING THAT CAME
TO MY MIND WAS
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY
OTHER COOKIES OUT THERE
WHERE YOU CAN BAKE THEM
YOURSELF AT HOME.
AND I HATE TO SAY THAT,
BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE YOU,
BUT I THOUGHT,
THIS IS JUST SO COMPETITIVE.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
Leah: THANK YOU.
I DON'T DOUBT YOUR ABILITY
TO, UM, SELL.
I THINK YOU'RE --
YOU'RE BOTH HUSTLING
IN THE MOST POSITIVE WAY.
I LOVE THE FACT
YOU LEFT AN INDUSTRY
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
PASSION FOR,
AND YOU'RE DOING IT
FOR YOURSELF.
YOU KNOW --
RIGHT. WE ARE WORKING
SO HARD.
YEAH, YOU'RE WORKING SUPER HARD.
IT'S VERY ADMIRABLE.
YOU'RE WORKING ALL THE TIME.
YOU KNOW, I HONESTLY
WAS RAISED...
[ Voice breaking ]
BY A SINGLE MOM
THAT STRUGGLED WITH
DRUG ADDICTION HER WHOLE LIFE,
AND I WORKED MY WAY OUT.
I, UH...SORRY, I'M PREGNANT,
WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON
I'M, LIKE, CRYING.
NO PROBLEM AT ALL. NO PROBLEM.
AND THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY
GAVE ME MY MOTIVATION
TO BE WHERE I AM,
IS FROM SEEING MY MOTHER,
WHO'S MADE
A LOT OF BAD DECISIONS
AND PUT US IN A LOT
OF BAD SITUATIONS.
AND SO IT'S BEEN MY MOTIVATION
TO NEVER GO THROUGH THAT
AND TO NEVER PUT MY OWN FAMILY
THROUGH IT.
[ CRIES ] AND I --
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU.
OH.
AND WE DID IT ALL 'CAUSE
WE BELIEVE IN THE PRODUCT,
WE BELIEVE IN THE BUSINESS.
[ SNIFFLES ]
BUT LET ME, UH, LET ME
MAKE A STATEMENT HERE, JUST --
UNLESS YOU GET THE PRODUCTION
DOWN TO $1.70,
YOU'LL GO OUT OF BUSINESS,
I'M SORRY.
WE CAN CRY ALL WE WANT,
BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[ CHUCKLES ]
OKAY? YOU WILL NEVER MAKE --
DON'T MAKE A PREGNANT GIRL
CRY ANY MORE.
NO, I GET IT. I GET THAT --
[ LAUGHTER ]
JUST -- AND SO, YOU --
AND I'M SURE THERE'S A WAY
FOR YOU TO DO THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
RIGHT NOW,
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET
THERE PRETTY QUICKLY,
OR YOU'RE GOING TO ZERO.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, A COUPLE
OF THOUGHTS.
YES.
HONESTLY, WHEN I HEARD
SCRATCH &amp; GRAIN,
I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT SCRATCHING.
SHE'S RIGHT.
I KNOW YOU MEANT
"FROM SCRATCH,"
BUT I THINK WHEN
IT'S THE FIRST WORD,
I DIDN'T QUITE GET THAT,
AND I THINK
A TYPICAL CONSUMER WOULD NOT.
I ALSO WISH YOU HAD
COME IN HERE AND SAID,
"HEY, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR $50,000."
NO PROBLEM. I WOULD HAVE
TAKEN A CHANCE.
$150,000 IS WAY TOO MUCH.
TOO RISKY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND
THE $150,000.
WELL, I HAVE A WAY TO GET
AROUND THAT.
HOW?
ALL THE TIME I'VE BEEN UP HERE,
I'VE NEVER LOST MONEY
IN SOMEBODY WHO DEEPLY BELIEVES
IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING
AND SEES IT AS SOMETHING GREATER
THAN JUST MAKING A BUCK.
YOU'VE GOT THAT IN SPADES.
HOWEVER, THE CATEGORY
IS PROBABLY
A LITTLE TOO SMALL
FOR ME TODAY.
THIS IS DEFINITELY
A BARBARA CATEGORY
SHE UNDERSTANDS.
OH, THANK YOU.
I'M SO COMPLIMENTED.
IT IS A COMPLIMENT.
HER ONLY OBJECTION WAS
IT'S TOO MUCH OF AN ASK.
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000 FOR 40%
AS LONG AS YOU CAN CONVINCE
BARBARA TO COME IN
FOR HALF OF IT.
I WANT TO PARTICIPATE,
BUT BARBARA CAN ADD
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VALUE
TO THIS CATEGORY.
TELL ME THAT AGAIN, ROBERT.
IN FACT, HERE'S MY OFFER
AND IT EXCLUDES ROBERT.
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
AS A LINE OF CREDIT,
BARBARA, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE!
OF COURSE IT MAKES SENSE.
IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
WITH MY OFFER, YOU HAVE TO
PUT UP HALF THE MONEY
AND GET THE SAME EQUITY.
Kevin: YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
IN THE DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
Mark: AND IT'S NOT FAIR
TO TAKE 40%.
NO FAIR -- HE'S A LOVELY GUY,
BUT HE IS A PAIN IN THE ASS
WHEN YOU TRY TO REACH HIM.
AND THAT'S NOT ANY FUN.
BUH-BAM!
I LIKE TO MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS
WITH MY ENTREPRENEURS,
SEE WHAT THEY THINK,
BANG, MOVE QUICKLY.
AND BESIDES WHICH --
ROBERT, BARBARA JUST
THREW YOU UNDER A BUS.
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH HER.
BARBARA WRITES
ON A STONE TABLET.
SO THAT IT'S --
[ LAUGHTER ]
I USE THIS FANCY THING
CALLED E-MAIL.
LOOK, I -- SHE OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T WANT ME IN THE DEAL.
I REALLY BELIEVED IN YOU GUYS.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
MAKING US AN OFFER
WITHOUT BARBARA?
TAYA, ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE NOT CRYING ANYMORE
AND YOU'VE GOT THIS NASTY
ELEMENT I REALLY LIKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I-I'LL MAKE THE SAME OFFER
WITH OR WITHOUT BARBARA --
$150,000 FOR 40%.
OKAY.
LADIES, THE COOKIES ARE BURNING.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
[ LAUGHS ]
[ MOUTHS WORDS ]
ROBERT, WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY
LOVE TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER,
BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE
BARBARA'S.
THERE WE GO, ROBERT.
WHOO-HOO!
CAN'T SAY NO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
SORRY, BIG BOY. YOU'RE EVEN
SMARTER THAN I THOUGHT.
BARBARA!
[ LAUGHING ]
Taya and Leah: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. BYE.
BYE.
I LIKE THOSE WOMEN.
I'M HAPPY THEY GOT A DEAL.
[ Voice breaking ] WE'VE JUST
BOTH PUT OUR HEART AND OUR SOUL
INTO THIS BUSINESS,
SO THIS IS A GREAT DAY.
I'M SO THANKFUL AND HAPPY
THAT WE GOT A DEAL.
I'M VERY HAPPY.
$150,000 FOR 45%.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
DONE.
SINCE "SHARK TANK,"
IT HAS BEEN
A WILD
AND RIDICULOUSLY FUN RIDE.
WITH DAYMOND'S INVESTMENT,
I'VE CONSTRUCTED
MY 320-ACRE PROPERTY
CALLED SPY RANCH HERE IN UTAH.
ORIGINALLY, DAYMOND WAS AGAINST
OPENING UP SPY RANCH
HERE IN UTAH, BUT ONCE
I SHOWED HIM THE NUMBERS
AND HE SAW THE POTENTIAL,
HE'S 100% BACKING IT.
WE TEACH COURSES
FROM EVASIVE DRIVING
TO FIREARMS TRAINING
TO HAND-TO-HAND SELF-DEFENSE.
[ GRUNTS ]
THE YEAR BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
I HAD $306,000 IN SALES.
NOW, IN JUST EIGHT MONTHS,
I'VE GOT ALMOST $2 MILLION
IN SALES.
WE'VE SECURED A ROYALTY DEAL
FOR SEVERAL OF MY PRODUCTS,
A SPY FLASHLIGHT,
WE HAVE A TACTICAL PEN,
AND WE HAVE AN ESCAPE
AND EVASION BELT,
WHICH IS A SPECIAL GUN BELT
THAT HAS
SECRET HIDDEN COMPARTMENTS
FOR SURVIVAL GEAR.
THE QUESTIONS YOU DON'T ASK MAY
COST YOU YOUR LIFE ONE DAY.
WHEN I CAME ON "SHARK TANK,"
I LACKED
A TON OF BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE
AND I NEEDED A SHARK.
GETTING THAT DEAL WITH DAYMOND
HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.
I LOVE THESE THINGS --
WHAT'S UP?
HEY!
HOW YOU DOING?
Daymond: I CAME TO SPY RANCH
TODAY TO CHECK IN ON JASON,
CHECK OUT THE AMAZING PROPERTY,
GET A LITTLE TRAINING,
AND OFFICIALLY BECOME A SPY.
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING,
KEEP GOING.
YOU HAVE TO BE PERFECT.
YES!
[ TIRES SCREECH ]
WHOO! PERFECT!
Daymond: SPY RANCH IS AMAZING.
IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING HERE
FROM TACTICAL TRAINING,
TARGET PRACTICE --
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS.
[ GUNFIRE ]
SHOOT!
THIS CAN BE A FRANCHISE
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE ONE
IN EVERY CITY
IN EVERY SINGLE STATE.
I AM OFFICIALLY A SPY!
YOU ARE THE BEST!
AWESOME.
