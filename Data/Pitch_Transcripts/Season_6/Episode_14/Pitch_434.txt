HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL WOOLEY,
AND I'M THE CHIEF
FINANCIAL OFFICER OF VESTPAKZ.
WELL, HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ARTHUR GRAYER.
I AM THE OFFICIAL LICENSEE
OF THE VESTPAK.
I'M ASKING FOR $50,000
FOR EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
WE HAVE ADDED A NEW TWIST
TO THE COMMON VEST.
VESTPAKZ WAS INVENTED
BY MY DAUGHTER
WHEN SHE WAS IN 6th GRADE.
HER TEACHER GAVE HER
A SCIENCE PROJECT --
FIND A PROBLEM,
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.
SHE THOUGHT,
"BACKPACKS ARE HEAVY."
SHE CREATED A NEW BACKPACK
THAT'S MORE COMFORTABLE,
CONVENIENT, AND STYLISH.
HUH.
INTRODUCING VESTPAK.
IT'S A VEST-PACK COMBINATION.
ITS FUNCTIONAL DESIGN HELPS
DISTRIBUTE THE WEIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GREAT JOB MODELING.
A MODEL IN THE MAKING.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
IN THE BACKPACK BUSINESS
FOR OVER 30 YEARS,
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN
A PRODUCT LIKE THIS BEFORE.
REMEMBER, YOU CAN PUT
IMPORTANT STUFF UP FRONT,
OKAY, SHARKS, WHO WANTS
TO START PUTTING
HOW MUCH <i>MONEY</i> DO YOU HAVE
IN SALES?
[ LAUGHS ]
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY
WE HAD APPROXIMATELY
$10,000 WORTH.
YEAH. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU OWN THE RIGHTS
FOR THE PRODUCT.
RIGHT.
AND THEN YOU LICENSED IT
TO ARTHUR.
AND ONLY ARTHUR CAN SELL
THE PRODUCT.
IS THAT RIGHT?
THAT'S TRUE. THAT IS TRUE.
CAN WE SEE THE PRODUCT?
GUYS, COME ON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS, SWEETIE.
YEAH.
FOR ME, FOR ME.
I'LL TAKE THE LOLLIPOP.
THANK YOU.
OKAY. COME ON, KIDS.
Kevin: YEAH, IT'S BEST TO GET
RID OF THE KIDS
'CAUSE THINGS ARE ABOUT
TO GET UGLY.
Barbara: HA!
Mark: GOOD JOB, GUYS.
Arthur: GREAT JOB. GREAT JOB.
Lori: BYE.
ARTHUR, YOU BUY THE PRODUCT
THEN YOU PAY A FEE TO MICHAEL.
WHAT IS THAT FEE THAT YOU PAY
OFF EVERY PRODUCT?
I MAKE 6 1/2% ROYALTY.
AND HOW MUCH DO THESE
SELL FOR?
THAT ONE SELLS
FOR $14.88 RETAIL.
AND WHAT DID IT COST YOU
TO MAKE THAT?
THAT COST AROUND $4.75.
AND THE TOTAL SALES OVER
WHAT PERIOD OF TIME ARE WHAT?
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS
LAST NOVEMBER WE SIGNED
A LICENSE AGREEMENT.
WE HAD IT IN A BIG BOX STORE
FOR JANUARY AND FEBRUARY.
WHICH ONE?
WALMART.
YOU HAD THIS AT WALMART?
YES.
Mark: HOW MANY STORES
WERE YOU IN?
75 STORES.
$10,000 IN SALES
IN 75 WALMARTS.
WELL, THE QUESTION NEXT --
WELL, THEY GAVE YOU A TEST.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY DELISTED IT
WHEN YOU DIDN'T SELL ANY?
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO
GOTTEN IT OUT,
YOU KNOW, DURING HOLIDAY, BUT IT
DID GO OUT DURING JANUARY.
IS WALMART GOING TO RE-ORDER
AND SELL IT IN MORE STORES?
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO SEE,
WHAT HAPPENS
DURING BACK TO SCHOOL.
WE'LL FIND OUT AT THAT TIME.
BUT, ARTHUR,
JUST PUT YOURSELF
IN MY SHOES FOR A MOMENT.
SURE.
YOU'RE IN WALMART.
YES.
LARGEST RETAILER IN THE WORLD.
YOU'RE IN 75 STORES, YOU'VE ONLY
DONE $10,000 IN SALES.
THAT SEEMS BAD TO ME.
Barbara: TELL US
WHAT WE'RE MISSING HERE.
WELL, THE THING IS --
TELL US WHY THIS IS
GOOD NEWS.
Robert: YEAH.
WELL, THIS IS VERY GOOD NEWS.
WHY?
THAT THEY'RE EVEN WILLING TO --
THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO,
YOU KNOW, TRY SOMETHING OUT.
CAN WE COME BACK AND LET ME
GIVE A LITTLE HISTORY?
AFTER MY DAUGHTER
HAD INVENTED IT,
SHE WON HER 6th GRADE
SCIENCE CLASS CONTEST.
THEN ANOTHER CONTEST CALLED
MILLION DOLLAR IDEA CHALLENGE
COMES UP,
AND SO IT WAS PUT ON
OPRAH WINFREY.
AND STILL YOU ONLY SOLD
$10,000?
NO, NO, NO, NO --
THIS IS NOT A GOOD STORY!
THIS WAS BACK IN 2003.
HOW OLD'S YOUR DAUGHTER NOW?
SHE'S 27.
[ LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY ]
REALLY?
MICHAEL, I THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOUR DAUGHTER.
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOSH.
YOU MADE IT SEEM LIKE
THIS JUST HAPPENED,
AND IT WAS A NEW PRODUCT
WITH ALL THIS MOMENTUM.
I DON'T KNOW --
WHAT DID I SAY TO MAKE --
WHEN YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER IN 6th GRADE,
WE SEE THESE KIDS --
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK
THAT THIS JUST HAPPENED
RECENTLY?
YEAH. TOTALLY.
AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WINNING THESE CONTESTS
AND GETTING THIS ATTENTION,
IT WAS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.
WELL...
[ LAUGHS ] WHAT HAPPENED?
BUT -- BUT WE SEE --
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!
SHE WAS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.
IT TOOK A WHILE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY IS THERE THIS
HUGE BLOCK OF TIME
WHERE NOTHING MUCH HAPPENED?
I DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDS
TO -- TO --
TO GO AND BUY
A LOT OF STOCK.
HOW OLD WAS YOUR DAUGHTER
IN 6th GRADE? 11?
AND SHE'S 27 NOW?
RIGHT.
RIGHT? SO THAT'S --
RIGHT, IT'S 16 YEARS.
[ LAUGHING ] 16 YEARS!
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS TH--
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND OUR GAP OF
CREDIBILITY OVER THAT 16 YEARS?
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY
IF YOU WOULD HAVE
JUST TOLD US THAT.
NO, I UNDERS--
I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE
COMING FROM, BUT --
Lori: ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE MAGIC QUESTION.
HOW MUCH HAS YOUR SALES BEEN...
SINCE SHE WAS IN 6th GRADE.
...IN THE LAST 16 YEARS?
BASICALLY, THE $10,000
FOR JANUARY AND FEBRUARY.
OKAY, GUYS, WHEN THIS PRODUCT
CAME OUT,
"MANDY" WAS NUMBER ONE, OKAY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'LL START THERE.
SINCE THEN, NOTHING'S HAPPENED
UNTIL YOU PUT IT INTO WALMART.
WE STILL DON'T KNOW YET
IF IT'S GOING TO BE
DELISTED OR NOT.
YEAH.
WE'RE GONNA WAIT FOR
THE BACK TO SCHOOL SEASON.
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT
PIECE OF INFORMATION,
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORTH $500,000
UNTIL I KNOW THAT WALMART
WANTS TO KEEP IT IN.
AND IN THE CASE OF THIS PRODUCT,
WHETHER WE GET TOGETHER NOW
OR IN ANOTHER DECADE,
WHO CARES?
IT'S JUST A BLIP
IN THE LONG DURATION
OF HOW LONG THIS THING'S
BEEN AROUND.
MAY I ADD SOMETHING NOW?
MY BET IS
IF I WENT TO THE SMITHSONIAN
AND WENT TO THE BACKPACK
MUSEUM...
IT'D BE THERE!
...I WOULD FIND THAT HERE.
ACTUALLY, UH, IT'S FUNNY
YOU MENTIONED THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
'CAUSE THEY HAVE INVITED US
FOR 2015 FOR THE EXHIBITS.
OKAY, I'M ABOUT TO SAY --
AND THIS IS SERIOUS --
I'M OUT.
MAY I SAY THAT THERE IS
A PROBLEM OUT THERE.
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,
WITH SOME OF THE HEAVY BOOKS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT, AND IT DOES
DISTRIBUTE THE WEIGHT.
WE TESTED IT,
AND IT WAS LESS WEIGHT.
Robert: YOU KNOW, YOU SEEM
LIKE A GENUINE PERSON.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAME OUT HERE
TO MISLEAD US.
NO.
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE WITH IT.
FORGET THE 16 YEARS,
FORGET THE SONG "MANDY."
FORGET ALL THAT.
$10,000 IN SALES
FOR 75 STORES --
IT'S NOT A GOOD NUMBER.
IT TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP
SOME OF THESE THINGS.
I'M REALLY AT
THE BEGINNING STAGES.
I-I HEAR YOU, BUT $10,000
IN 75 STORES
IN THE LARGEST RETAILER
IN THE WORLD --
AND I ALSO HAVE A TEST GOING
INTO TOYS "R" US,
WHICH IS FAO SCHWARZ,
AS YOU KNOW.
I HAVE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE
GONNA BE TRYING IT, TOO.
THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE.
I'M OUT.
GUYS, I ACTUALLY LIKE
THE PRODUCT.
IT'S NOT BAD.
BUT WE INVEST
IN THE ENTREPRENEURS
AND WE INVEST IN THE COMPANY.
SURE.
AND THERE'S JUST A WHOLE LOT
OF QUESTION MARKS IN MY MIND.
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
BARBARA AND LORI
STILL AREN'T OUT.
I HAPPEN TO LOVE THE PRODUCT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT?
IT'S A NEW TWIST ON SOMETHING
THAT EVERY KID IN AMERICA
BUYS EVERY OTHER YEAR.
AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS
I WANTED TO POINT OUT --
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I'M STILL TALKING.
THIS IS A SAD CASE,
QUITE HONESTLY, NO OFFENSE --
NO, IT'S FINE. YOU'RE FINE.
TO EITHER OF YOU --
THE RIGHT PRODUCT,
BUT THE WRONG ENTREPRENEURS.
I'M OUT.
OKAY, I GET IT,
YOU JUST GOT THIS PRODUCT,
AND YOU'RE TRYING
AND YOU'RE HUSTLING
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IT
INTO A LOT OF PLACES.
THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN YOU SAY
THAT YOU'RE IN THAT MANY
STORES...
SURE.
...AND YOU'RE ONLY DOING
$10,000,
UNFORTUNATELY,
WHETHER ANY OF US THINK
IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA,
THE CONSUMER IS SPEAKING.
RIGHT.
AND THEY'RE SAYING
THEY DON'T WANT IT.
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHTY.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG
THE VESTPAKZ HAS BEEN AROUND.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT,
AND --
AND VESTPAKZ IS ON THE WAY
TO THE TOP.
