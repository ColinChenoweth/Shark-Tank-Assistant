MY NAME IS KRISTINA GUERRERO,
Guerrero: GOOD BOY!
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,
THINGS GOT PRETTY ROCKY AT HOME,
SO WHEN I WAS 17, I APPLIED
TO THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY,
I'LL PASS ON THAT,
KRISTINA.
OKAY.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
I'VE SEEN REAL HYENAS ON THE
RANGES OF ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA,
KRISTINA,
WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT
THAN THE OTHER 5,000 DOG TREATS
ON THE MARKET?
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.
IT'S <i>NOT</i> A DOG TREAT.
KRISTINA, IS IT LIKE AN
ENERGY BAR FOR DOGS, BASICALLY?
[ Laughing ] NO.
NO, BUT IT WAS DESIGNED
TO <i>SUSTAIN</i> ENERGY.
WELL, TELL ME,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES SO FAR
KRISTINA,
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
MY BACKGROUND IS,
WHEN I WAS 17, I LEFT HOME,
WENT TO THE UNITED STATES
AIR FORCE ACADEMY.
GRADUATED FROM THE AIR FORCE
ACADEMY IN 2002.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WENT ON, BECAME A DISTINGUISHED
GRADUATE OF PILOT TRAINING,
FLEW C-130s
THROUGH THREE DEPLOYMENTS.
WOW.
RECEIVED TWO COMBAT AIR MEDALS
FOR THE DEPLOYMENTS
IN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM,
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I CAME HOME
FROM MY THIRD DEPLOYMENT.
KRISTINA, ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT SKI SHOPS,
BIKE SHOPS, LIKE,
OUTDOOR PLACES?
YEP. YEP.
THAT'S SMART, BECAUSE
THERE'S A STRONG CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE TWO.
Greiner:
YOU KNOW, KRISTINA,
I AM NOT SURE
ABOUT THE MARKET FOR THIS.
YOU'RE KIND OF FORGING AHEAD
IN SOMETHING NEW.
KRISTINA, HE'S OFFERING YOU
$100,000 FOR 40%.
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO COUNTER AT 30%?
35%?
IS THAT FAIR?
35% -- YOU GOT IT.
YES!
DONE? ALL RIGHT.
Cuban: THERE YOU GO.
IT'S A DEAL.
Greiner: THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
HYENA, BITE HIM.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
Greiner: CONGRATULATIONS.
KRISTINA,
CAN I HAVE THE DOG?
CONGRATULATIONS, KRISTINA.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
THAT WAS A MERCY FINANCE.
I THINK SHE GOT IT ALL TOGETHER
TO THIS POINT,
Guerrero: I AM SO ECSTATIC
THAT DAYMOND TOOK TurboPUP ON.
I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL
THAT HE SEES THE VISION.
I'M JUST SO EXCITED.
