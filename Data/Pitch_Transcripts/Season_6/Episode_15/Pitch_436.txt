MY NAME IS MAX.
SO, MAX, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
BATTERY-OPERATED.
HOW LONG
DO THE BATTERIES LAST FOR?
SO, MAX, IT BRINGS A SMILE
TO YOUR FACE WHEN YOU OPEN IT.
TELL ME YOUR VISION
BEHIND THE APPLICATION OF IT.
THIS IS A LIGHTING SOLUTION
THAT YOU CAN USE
AROUND THE HOUSE
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER,
BUT ALSO, I THINK
OUTDOOR MARKET IS HUGE.
WE LAUNCHED JUST LAST YEAR.
WE DID $1 MILLION WITHOUT
ANY ADVERTISING, MARKETING.
$1 MILLION?
CORRECT.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
WE GOT CLOSE TO $580,000
ON KICKSTARTER.
WOW.
WOW.
WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL?
$60,000.
WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?
CURRENTLY,
WE'RE SELLING $190 PER UNIT.
$190?
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?
RIGHT NOW,
WE ARE AT $65.
DAYMOND, FIRST YEAR,
OUR COST OF GOODS WAS $80.
IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS,
WE ARE ABLE
TO LOWER IT DOWN TO $65.
I LIVED IN THE FACTORY
FOR FOUR MONTHS.
WHAT COUNTRY?
I HAD TO GO TO CHINA.
SO THAT YOU COULD
WATCH THE PROCESS
Cuban: MAX, KEEP ON TELLING US
ABOUT YOUR VISION.
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT FOLLOWS THIS. WHAT'S NEXT?
SO, I'VE CREATED
THIS PROTOTYPE.
SO, IT'S A MINI VERSION.

YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH.
