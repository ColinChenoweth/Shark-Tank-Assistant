MY NAME IS KRISTINA GUERRERO,
AND I LIVE IN THE SMALL TOWN
OF LA PINE, OREGON,
WITH MY HUSBAND, BRANDON,
AND OUR TWO CANINE SIDEKICKS,
DUNKAN AND ODIN.
Guerrero: GOOD BOY!
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,
THINGS GOT PRETTY ROCKY AT HOME,
SO WHEN I WAS 17, I APPLIED
TO THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY,
AND IT WAS THE BEST DECISION
I EVER MADE.
I GRADUATED AS A LIEUTENANT
AND WENT ON TO FLY C-130s
IN SUPPORT OF THREE DEPLOYMENTS.
AFTER THE AIR FORCE,
I DECIDED TO FOLLOW MY PASSIONS.
IT BASICALLY BROUGHT ME
TO THE BACKCOUNTRY OF OREGON.
I'M A MOUNTAIN GIRL, AND I LOVE
HANGING OUT WITH MY DOGS.
MY DOGS AND I WERE
AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
WHEN I REALIZED
I DIDN'T PACK ENOUGH SUPPLIES.
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND I REALIZED
THERE'S A REALLY SIMPLE SOLUTION
TO THIS PROBLEM.
SO WE GOT HOME, AND I STARTED
FORMULATING MY PRODUCT
AND OUR BUSINESS
HAS BEEN GROWING EVER SINCE.
GREAT. LET ME JUST GET DOWN
YOUR PHONE NUMBER.
SINCE I'VE STARTED
THIS BUSINESS,
IT'S BEEN AN UPHILL BATTLE.
I'VE BEEN MAKING
A LOT OF MISTAKES,
AND I PUT MY SAVINGS
ON THE LINE.
I DEFINITELY NEED SOMEONE
WITH MORE BUSINESS SAVVY
TO HELP MY COMPANY EVOLVE,
AND I HOPE THAT THE SHARKS
CAN SEE HOW DETERMINED I AM
TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS
SUCCESSFUL.

HI.
MY NAME IS KRISTINA GUERRERO,
AND THIS IS ODIN,
AND WE'RE OUT HERE TODAY
FROM LA PINE, OREGON,
ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR A 20% STAKE
INTO OUR COMPANY, TurboPUP.
LIKE A LOT OF DOG OWNERS,
MY DOGS AREN'T JUST MY PETS.
THEY'RE MY SIDEKICKS.
WHETHER I'M SKIING,
HIKING, TRAVELING --
EVEN SWIMMING WITH SHARKS --
CHANCES ARE MY DOG IS WITH ME.
BUT WHAT <i>WASN'T</i> FUN WAS
PACKING BULKY BAGS OF DOG FOOD,
ESPECIALLY WHEN WEIGHT,
QUALITY, AND SIZE MATTER.
SO I CREATED TurboPUP --
COMPLETE CANINE MEAL BARS.
TurboPUP BARS ARE MADE
WITH 100% AMERICAN-SOURCED,
HUMAN-GRADE, ALL-NATURAL,
GRAIN-FREE INGREDIENTS.
THEY'RE SAFE
ON SENSITIVE STOMACHS
AND INTERCHANGEABLE
WITH REGULAR DOG FOOD.
WHEN I'M OUT IN THE BACKCOUNTRY
OR TRAVELING,
I'M MAKING SURE
I HAVE THE FUEL I NEED.
WOW.
SO I DESIGNED TurboPUP BARS
SPECIFICALLY TO SUSTAIN
DOGS' ENERGY LEVELS...
[ LAUGHS ]
...AND, OF COURSE,
FUEL ALL DOGKIND.
IF YOU GUYS
WANT TO CHECK OUT THE BARS,
I CAN BRING THEM OVER
AND YOU CAN GIVE SOME TO ODIN.
YEAH.
LET'S DO THAT.
Greiner:
I WOULD LOVE THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
IS THIS EDIBLE
FOR HUMANS, TOO?
'CAUSE YOU SAID
IT WAS HUMAN-GRADE.
IT'S HUMAN-GRADE INGREDIENTS,
'CAUSE WE JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY WERE SUPER-PREMIUM.
SO, EACH ONE OF THOSE BARS
IS 250 CALORIES,
SO YOU CAN ONLY GIVE THEM
JUST A LITTLE PIECE.
HE REALLY LIKES IT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE NOW,
ROBERT.
THAT WHOLE BAR
WENT DOWN.
HE LIKES IT.
[ Laughing ]
OH, MY GOD.
COME ON, ODIN.
KEVIN, DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE HIM SOME?
I'LL PASS ON THAT,
KRISTINA.
OKAY.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
I'VE SEEN REAL HYENAS ON THE
RANGES OF ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA,
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
THAT'S A HYENA, NOT A DOG.
[ LAUGHTER ]
KRISTINA,
WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT
THAN THE OTHER 5,000 DOG TREATS
ON THE MARKET?
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT.
IT'S <i>NOT</i> A DOG TREAT.
WHAT IS IT?
A SANDWICH?
IT'S A COMPLETE MEAL.
SO, THAT'S 250 CALORIES.
AND BECAUSE
THE INGREDIENTS ARE SO PREMIUM,
YOU CAN JUST INTERCHANGE IT
WITH REGULAR DOG FOOD.
SO, HOW EXPENSIVE IS IT
IF IT'S SO PREMIUM?
SO, THE ONE-PACKS,
MSRP IS $2.99,
AND THE TWO-PACKS,
MSRP IS $4.99.
[ LAUGHTER ]
KRISTINA, IS IT LIKE AN
ENERGY BAR FOR DOGS, BASICALLY?
[ Laughing ] NO.
NO, BUT IT WAS DESIGNED
TO <i>SUSTAIN</i> ENERGY.
WELL, TELL ME,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES SO FAR
AND WHERE
ARE YOU SELLING THEM?
SO, I STARTED SELLING
IN MAY 2013.
THESE WERE THE BARS
THAT I STARTED WITH.
I WAS MAKING THEM
OUT OF MY KITCHEN.
I WAS HAND-CUTTING
AND HAND-SEALING EACH BAR.
HOW MUCH DID YOU SELL?
WE HAD $4,000 IN SALES.
OKAY, AND THEN THIS YEAR,
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
WE'VE SOLD...$7,000.
KRISTINA,
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
MY BACKGROUND IS,
WHEN I WAS 17, I LEFT HOME,
WENT TO THE UNITED STATES
AIR FORCE ACADEMY.
GRADUATED FROM THE AIR FORCE
ACADEMY IN 2002.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WENT ON, BECAME A DISTINGUISHED
GRADUATE OF PILOT TRAINING,
FLEW C-130s
THROUGH THREE DEPLOYMENTS.
WOW.
RECEIVED TWO COMBAT AIR MEDALS
FOR THE DEPLOYMENTS
IN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM,
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I CAME HOME
FROM MY THIRD DEPLOYMENT.
HIM AND I
WERE BACKCOUNTRY SKIING.
WE WENT ABOUT 8 MILES
UP THE MOUNTAIN.
I HAD A BURRITO
OR SOME CHOCOLATE POWER BARS.
I, OF COURSE, DIDN'T THINK
OF PACKING DOG FOOD.
HE ATE THE BURRITO,
I ATE THE POWER BAR,
AND I HAD THIS LIGHT-BULB MOMENT
WHERE I JUST THOUGHT,
"WHY DON'T THEY HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
"THAT'S A FULL MEAL --
NOT A TREAT -- FOR DOGS
FOR WHEN I GO OUT IN THE
BACKCOUNTRY OR WHEN I TRAVEL?"
WHO'S BUYING IT?
THIS IS
THE REALLY INTERESTING PART.
BECAUSE THE PET MARKET
IS SO SATURATED,
I DECIDED TO TRY
ANOTHER ROUTE.
I DECIDED TO START
APPROACHING OUTDOOR STORES.
AND HOW DID THEY RESPOND?
STOKED.
WHILE I WAS MAKING THE BARS
OUT OF MY KITCHEN,
TurboPUP BECAME
THE OFFICIAL DOG FOOD
OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WOW.
THANK YOU.
KRISTINA, ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT SKI SHOPS,
BIKE SHOPS, LIKE,
OUTDOOR PLACES?
YEP. YEP.
THAT'S SMART, BECAUSE
THERE'S A STRONG CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE TWO.
AND THERE'S NO COMPETITION
RIGHT NOW.
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THAT'S VERY, VERY CLEVER.
THAT'S VERY SMART.
SO, RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE ABOUT 30 RETAILERS,
BUT THE CONVERSATION IS THERE
WITH MUCH BIGGER RETAILERS,
AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING TO
A PET STORE THAT HAS 55 STORES.
AND THIS IS JUST TO START.
AND THIS IS A ONE-WOMAN SHOW.
YOUR MOVE TO GO INTO
THE OUTDOOR STORES -- BRILLIANT.
THE ISSUE FOR ME IS,
WHEN I PARTNER WITH SOMEBODY,
I TRY TO GO ALL-IN
AND HELP AND LEARN.
I JUST DON'T KNOW YOUR AREA
AT ALL.
OKAY.
AND I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE TIME, IN REALITY,
TO DIG IN
AND LEARN IT FOR YOU.
I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BUT YOU DESERVE
A TON OF CREDIT.
YOU'RE MAKING
ALL THE RIGHT STEPS.
I'M WITH HIM --
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT,
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY
BUSINESS THAT COMES OUT HERE
IS READY
FOR AN INVESTMENT.
RIGHT.
KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
GET THE SALES
FROM $7,000 TO $100,000,
AND <i>THEN</i> MAYBE
LOOK FOR AN INVESTMENT.
RIGHT --
AT THIS POINT, I'M OUT.
Greiner:
YOU KNOW, KRISTINA,
I AM NOT SURE
ABOUT THE MARKET FOR THIS.
YOU'RE KIND OF FORGING AHEAD
IN SOMETHING NEW.
YOU ARE MAKING A MEAL FOR A DOG,
AND YOU'RE LEARNING.
DO PEOPLE NEED IT AND WANT IT
OR DON'T THEY?
SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD
TO SLOWLY GROW
AND KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AND LEARNING HOW BIG THE MARKET
IS FOR THIS STEP BY STEP.
AND THEN YOU GROW
IN A SMART WAY.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
THEN THERE WAS TWO.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THEN
THERE IS TWO.
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PITCH.
$7,000 IN THE
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
PET-FOOD MARKET
IS TURBO-POOP ON A STICK.
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT
AND MAKE IT MORE COMPELLING.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET
AN INVESTMENT. I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I'M ON THE FENCE, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE $100,000 FOR 20%,
THAT VALUES YOUR COMPANY
AT $500,000.
THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE ASKING SO MUCH,
I WOULD HAVE TO <i>TAKE</i>
SO MUCH.
WHAT WOULD YOU ASK,
AS FAR AS YOUR EQUITY?
THE GAMBLE
THAT I WOULD TAKE WITH YOU IS,
BECAUSE OF YOUR TOURS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE,
YOU MUST BE DISCIPLINED.
KRISTINA, HE'S OFFERING YOU
$100,000 FOR 40%.
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO COUNTER AT 30%?
35%?
IS THAT FAIR?
35% -- YOU GOT IT.
YES!
DONE? ALL RIGHT.
Cuban: THERE YOU GO.
IT'S A DEAL.
Greiner: THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
HYENA, BITE HIM.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
Greiner: CONGRATULATIONS.
KRISTINA,
CAN I HAVE THE DOG?
CONGRATULATIONS, KRISTINA.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
THAT WAS A MERCY FINANCE.
I THINK SHE GOT IT ALL TOGETHER
TO THIS POINT,
AND A WOMAN WHO DID
THREE TOURS FOR OUR COUNTRY
Guerrero: I AM SO ECSTATIC
THAT DAYMOND TOOK TurboPUP ON.
I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL
THAT HE SEES THE VISION.
I'M JUST SO EXCITED.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A BUSINESS
DESIGNED FOR THE PERFECT FIT.
HELLO, SHARKS!
YOU'RE ALL LOOKING
MIGHTY DAPPER TODAY!
