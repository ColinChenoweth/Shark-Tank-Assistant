MY NAME IS JOE CHAY
FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO,
AND I'M SEEKING $360,000
FOR A 6% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY GROWING CUSTOM-CLOTHING
LABEL, BELLO VERDE.
BELLO VERDE IS THE ULTIMATE
LUXURY SUITING EXPERIENCE.
OUR MASTER TAILORS HAVE YEARS OF
KNOWLEDGE IN SUIT MANUFACTURING.
EACH OF OUR GARMENTS COMES WITH
FULL CANVAS CONSTRUCTION,
JOE, TELL US
ABOUT THE GUYS BEHIND YOU.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, THIS IS URIJAH FABER.
URIJAH IS A UFC SUPERSTAR.
SUPERSTAR!
SUPERSTAR.
HE WAS THE W.E.C. CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD,
AND HE'S ALSO BEEN
A HUGE INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE
AND A BIG MENTOR FOR ME,
AS WELL.
DEAN HAS BEEN
A GREAT FRIEND
AND CUSTOMER OF OUR CLOTHING
FOR YEARS,
AND HE JUST LOOKS GREAT
IN IT,
AND WHO BETTER THAN SUPERMAN,
DEAN CAIN?
WHAT DOES
"BELLO VERDE" MEAN?
IT MEANS "BEAUTIFUL GREEN"
IN ITALIAN.
I CAME UP WITH THE NAME
AFTER WORKING AT A PREVIOUS
COMPANY CALLED ASTOR &amp; BLACK.
HAVE YOU GUYS HEARD
OF ASTOR &amp; BLACK?
I HAVE.
OKAY, SO, ASTOR &amp; BLACK
WAS A COMPANY
THAT I WORKED FOR
FOR 10 YEARS.
I BASICALLY DID EVERYTHING THERE
FROM SALES TO MANAGEMENT.
I HAVEN'T HEARD
OF THAT BRAND.
WERE THEY
A HIGH-END-SUIT BRAND?
OH, YEAH. THEY DO
CUSTOM CLOTHING. AND I KNOW --
PURELY CUSTOM?
PURELY CUSTOM.
THEY WERE DOING
$42 MILLION IN SALES.
SO, LET'S TALK
ABOUT MY COMPANY.
DEAN, URIJAH,
WHY DON'T YOU GO SHOW THEM --
GO OVER THERE
AND SHOW THEM --
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY DEAN WEARS THE CLOTHES.
Cain: OKAY,
SO, I DON'T LIKE TO SHOP.
I DON'T LIKE TO GO IN.
I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO FIND
THINGS OFF THE RACK.
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
I'M A FOOTBALL PLAYER
ORIGINALLY.
I HAVE A DIFFERENT BUILD.
I WANT A SUIT THAT FITS ME,
THAT I LIKE,
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO
GO RUN AROUND AND LOOK FOR.
I WANT TO KNOW --
IF I'M NOT SO FASHION-FORWARD,
I WANT MY SALESPERSON
TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME,
"HEY, LOOK,
THIS IS WHAT'S IN NOW."
SO, JOE BASICALLY
IS ALSO KIND OF YOUR STYLIST.
YOU TRUST HIM?
YES.
DO YOU GO TO SOMEONE'S HOME --
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAID,
"I DON'T EVEN LIKE
GOING TO THE STORE."
DO YOU COME IN --
YEAH, THE WAY
THE ASTOR &amp; BLACK MODEL WORKS,
ALL THEIR SALES
WERE DIRECT AGENT --
FORGET THEIR MODEL.
TELL US ABOUT <i>YOUR</i> MODEL.
WELL, IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.
I WOULDN'T BE BORING YOU
WITH THE OLD-NEWS COMPANY
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT
TO MY STORY.
I PROMISE YOU
THERE'S SOMETHING GOOD.
Greiner:
ALL RIGHT, TELL US.
OKAY, GET INTO IT.
GET INTO IT.
OKAY, SO, THINGS WERE TOUGH
WHEN I LEFT.
WHEN I LEFT, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.
I DECIDED
TO OPEN UP BELLO VERDE.
I WAS VERY FORTUNATE --
ASTOR &amp; BLACK WENT UNDER,
AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DO SOMETHING
WHICH WOULD PUT ME
AT THE NEXT LEVEL.
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU DO?
DEAN, URIJAH,
SHOW THEM WHAT WE GOT!
BOOM!
I BOUGHT THAT COMPANY.
SO I OWN BOTH --
WHAT DID YOU
BUY IT FOR?
I BOUGHT IT FOR $405,000.
WHAT OTHER ASSETS DID YOU GET
FOR THE $405,000?
I GOT OVER $1 MILLION
IN BELTS, SHOES,
GOT IT, GOT IT.
SWEATERS, JEANS, TIES.
HOW MUCH CASH
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE?
SO, $1 MILLION
IN INVENTORY AND BELTS.
YES.
WHAT ELSE?
OVER $1 MILLION INVENTORY.
WE GOT A BACK-END WEB SYSTEM
THAT'S WORTH
OVER 3/4 OF $1 MILLION.
IT TIES OUR FACTORIES
TO OUR SALES AGENTS.
IT'S A CUSTOM SERVICE,
SO IF DEAN WANTS
SOMEBODY TO COME TO HIS HOME,
WHATEVER THE REP IS
IN THAT REGION
GOES TO HIS HOME
AND FITS HIM.
THAT IS WHAT ASTOR &amp; BLACK
OF THE PAST DID.
I HAVE A DIFFERENT IDEA.
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA?
THAT'S GONNA BE ONE OF FOUR
OF MY REVENUE STREAMS.
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA?
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA?
THE OTHER THREE
REVENUE STREAMS --
THE FIRST ONE
IS GOING TO BE ONLINE SALES.
WE'VE ALREADY DEVELOPED
AND LAUNCHED AN ONLINE STORE
FOR ACCESSORIES -- SHOES, BELTS,
SWEATERS, TIES, ALL THE ABOVE.
NO, I GOT IT.
WHAT'S THE OTHER MODEL?
THE OTHER MODEL
IS THERE ARE COMPANIES OUT THERE
THAT HAVE DEVELOPED
ALGORITHMS.
THESE ALGORITHMS CAN TAKE
BASIC QUESTIONS FROM A CONSUMER
AND SPIT OUT AND PRINT OUT
A SET OF MEASUREMENTS.
YEAH, ONE OF MY COMPANIES
IS FASHION METRIC,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DO.
AND I'VE SPOKEN TO THE C.E.O.
AND C.O.O. OF FASHION METRIC...
JOE, IS IT TRUE --
...ABOUT INCORPORATING
THAT TECHNOLOGY...
THEY WILL HELP YOU.
JOE, THROW ME
A BONE HERE.
I ONLY HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION,
VERY IMPORTANT.
YES.
THIS COMPANY THAT YOU BOUGHT
FOR $405,000 --
HOW MUCH CASH
WILL IT MAKE THIS YEAR?
HOW MUCH CASH DO <i>YOU</i> THINK
IT'LL MAKE THIS YEAR?
YOU MEAN
<i>I</i> HAVE TO ANSWER THAT?
WHAT,
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?
I WAS GONNA ASK YOUR QUESTION
FOR YOU.
YOU TELL <i>ME.</i>
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
NO, HE JUST WANTS TO TAKE
YOU OUT BEHIND THE BARN
AND SHOOT YOU. THAT'S ALL.
I'M ASKING YOU
AS AN INVESTOR,
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
I SHOULD KNOW?
NO, NO,
I'M JUST ASKING --
JOE,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
MY SALES THIS YEAR
WILL BE $2 MILLION.
ON THE $2 MILLION,
WE'LL NET OVER $500,000.
AND, SO, WHAT'S THE COST
OF AN AVERAGE SUIT?
WE TOP OUT IN
THE $2,500-TO-$3,000 SUIT RANGE,
BUT OUR
BREAD-AND-BUTTER BUSINESS
IS THAT
$1,000-TO-$1,500 SUIT.
ASTOR &amp; BLACK
DEFINITELY IS RECOGNIZABLE.
WHY NOW TWO NAMES?
THE REASON WHY IT'S GREAT
THAT WE HAVE TWO
IS BECAUSE
NOW WE CAN POSITION THEM --
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
HOLD ON. LET ME FINISH.
LET ME FINISH TELLING YOU
WHAT I WANT TO DO.
YEAH, YOU CAN,
BUT IT'S A HEADACHE.
LET ME TELL YOU MY PLAN.
TWO BRANDS.
THE FIRST ONE IS RETAIL.
ASTOR &amp; BLACK NEVER PUT IN
A SINGLE DOLLAR OF SALES
FOR RETAIL.
YOU WANT TO BE IN RETAIL?
Herjavec: SO,
YOU'RE GONNA GO RETAIL, JOE?
OOH.
I'M GOING TO PERHAPS
GIVE IT THE CONSIDERATION,
WITH ONE OF YOUR HELP.
THE OTHER TWO --
WHOLESALE.
I'M GONNA OPEN UP
A WHOLESALE STREAM
TO SELL THIS PRODUCT
TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS.
JOE, I ACTUALLY USE
ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS.
THAT'S WHY
I LOOK SO FABULOUS.
EVERYTHING IS MADE
BY MY TAILOR.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU USE.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU USE.
OKAY,
SO, HERE'S THE PROBLEM
THAT I LOOK AT AS A DISCIPLINED
FINANCIAL INVESTOR.
SURE.
YOU'VE COME IN HERE AND SAID,
"I'LL MAKE $500,000,"
AND YET YOU PRICED IT
AT 12 TIMES.
SURE.
I'M JUST LOOKING
AT YOUR VALUATION
AND SAYING TO MYSELF,
"YOU'RE SO FAR FROM REALITY,"
AND FOR THAT REASON,
JUST SO I CAN MAKE IT EASY
FOR DAYMOND TO BEAT YOU
WITH A STICK IN A MINUTE,
I'M OUT.
OKAY. NO PROBLEM.
AND I APPRECIATE IT, KEVIN.
I REALLY DO.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I SHOULD NOT BE IN
THE MEN'S CUSTOM-SUIT BUSINESS.
SO I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE IT, LORI.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JOE,
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
THERE ARE GUYS LIKE KEVIN
WHO LOVE CUSTOM SUITS,
THAT HAVE FUNNY BODIES,
WEIRD SHAPES.
ADONIS BODIES
REQUIRE A TAILOR.
I CAN THROW A DART
AND I CAN FIND IN TORONTO,
NEW YORK, L.A., BOSTON
HUNDREDS
OF CUSTOM TAILORS.
IT IS REALLY
A BRANDING EXERCISE.
I ALSO FIND THE DUAL-NAME
STRATEGY CONFUSING.
I THINK,
WHEN YOU'RE SMALL,
YOU GOT TO BE REALLY
LASER-LIKE FOCUSED, RIGHT?
SURE.
I THINK GOING TO MARKET
WITH TWO BRANDS LIKE THIS,
I MEAN,
IT'S JUST CONFUSING.
I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE IT.
YOU'VE GOT
MARK AND DAYMOND LEFT.
TWO SHARKS LEFT.
TWO SHARKS LEFT.
WHEN I FIRST SOLD
broadcast.com
AND I WAS WORTH
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
AND I FIGURED, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO DRESS UP,"
AND SO I WENT
TO OUR LOCAL CUSTOM GUY,
AND "OKAY,
LET'S DO IT UP RIGHT."
SO, LITERALLY,
I SPENT $95,000
AND GOT, LIKE, 19 SUITS,
AND I THOUGHT --
COME ON!
YOU NEVER
WORE THEM ONCE.
I'VE WORN THREE OF THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS FAR AS YOUR STRATEGY,
I THINK
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
YOU WERE ABLE TO BUY $1 MILLION
IN INVENTORY FOR $400,000,
GET THE BACK OFFICE,
GET THE ONLINE.
THE REAL ISSUE
IS THAT THE WAY YOU'VE PRICED IT
AT A $6 MILLION VALUATION,
YOU LITERALLY
HAVE TO GROW 10 TIMES
BEFORE YOU CAN
REALLY BE A PLAYER
FOR ME TO GET A RETURN
ON MY INVESTMENT.
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
IS MORE FAIR OF A NUMBER?
REGARDLESS,
YOU STILL HAVE TO GROW
TO GET TO THAT POINT
WHERE YOU ARE REALLY --
WE'RE <i>GONNA</i> GROW.
WE'RE DOUBLING NEXT YEAR.
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO --
JOE. JOE.
JOE! SHH!
WE KNOW.
YOU'RE A GOOD SALESPERSON.
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO FAR
WITH THIS COMPANY.
BUT AS AN INVESTOR,
I DON'T THINK THE REWARD
IS THERE RELATIVE TO THE RISK.
I'M OUT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
OKAY, JOE, GET FOCUSED.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SHARK LEFT.
OKAY, BIG "D,"
WHATCHA GONNA DO?
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER,
AND IT'S GONNA BE SO SWEET,
IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU A CAVITY.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER,
AND IT'S GONNA BE SO SWEET,
IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU A CAVITY.
NOW...
[ LAUGHTER ]
I BET IT'S GONNA BE
VERY PAINFUL.
OH.
YOU ASKED FOR $360,000
FOR 6%.
I WILL GIVE YOU $360,000
FOR 33%.
[ LAUGHS ]
OHHHHH!
O'Leary:
OKAY, MR. LEPRECHAUN.
YOU'VE JUST BEEN OFFERED
A POT OF GOLD.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
Chay: THAT IS A NUMBER
THAT IS SO FAR OFF
FROM WHAT I WOULD ACCEPT
THAT IT'S PROBABLY
NOT EVEN A GOOD IDEA
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
ABOUT IT.
MAKE A COUNTER.
I MEAN, MY COUNTEROFFER
WOULD BE $360,000 FOR 7%.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GUY'S GOT
A LOT OF ROOM TO MOVE.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO COUNTER WITH SOMETHING
THAT'S SOMEWHERE
REALISTIC...
MY BOTTOM LINE
IS $360,000 --
AND IF I DID THIS,
BY THE WAY,
TELL US.
IT WOULD BE INSULTING
TO THE OTHER --
GET IT OUT!
WHAT IS IT?!
$360,000
FOR 8% OF THE COMPANY.
THAT IS MY BOTTOM LINE.
IT'S GONNA GET REALLY UGLY
IN A MINUTE.
NO, I DON'T THINK IT IS.
IT IS. YEAH.
Herjavec:
IT'S HILARIOUS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
DAYMOND?
I WILL GIVE YOU
$360,000 --
'CAUSE I THINK YOU JUST
WENT CRAZY FOR A SECOND --
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
$360,000...
...FOR 25%.
LISTEN --
AND NOW I'M BENDING
A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT?
LISTEN,
I APPRECIATE THE BEND.
AND I WOULD
APPRECIATE --
I APPRECIATE THE BEND.
I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU GUYS.
YOU GUYS ARE MISSING OUT
ON A GIANT OPPORTUNITY.
I KNOW
YOU GUYS DON'T NEED IT.
WELL, FRANKLY, <i>YOU'RE</i> MISSING
OUT ON A GIANT OPPORTUNITY, TOO.
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T GIVE AWAY
1/4 OF A BUSINESS
THAT I KNOW
IS WORTH AS MUCH AS I --
NO, I GET IT,
BUT WHY DON'T YOU COUNTER HIM
WITH SOMETHING
THAT'S MORE REASONABLE?
I <i>AM</i> COUNTERING HIM
WITH SOMETHING
THAT I THINK
IS MORE REASONABLE.
COME TO YOUR SENSES,
OR WE'RE GONNA BE KICKING YOU
OUT OF HERE IN A SECOND.
SO, ARE YOU DECLINING
MY OFFER?
AT THAT LEVEL, REGRETFULLY,
I HAVE TO DECLINE.
OKAY.
I'M NOT COUNTERING.
JOE, SAYONARA.
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU GUYS' TIME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND SEE YOU
ON THE ROAD TO $100 MILLION.
O'Leary: NEVER IN THE HISTORY
OF "SHARK TANK"
WHAT AN IDIOT.
HAVE I HEARD SOMEBODY
TALK SO MUCH AND SAY SO LITTLE.
Chay: I THOUGHT THE SHARKS
COULD BE STRATEGIC INVESTORS,
BUT ULTIMATELY,
IF THEY FAIL TO SEE THE VISION
OR GIVE PROPER VALUATION
TO MY BUSINESS,
THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT TYPE
OF PARTNER FOR ME.
