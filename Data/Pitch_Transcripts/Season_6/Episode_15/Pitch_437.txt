MY NAME IS MAX.
I'M THE FOUNDER AND CREATOR
OF LUMIO.
TODAY I'M SEEKING $250,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 8% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
LUMIO.
IT'S AN ELEGANT
LIGHTING SOLUTION
THAT GIVES YOU THE FREEDOM
TO EXPERIENCE BEAUTIFUL LIGHTING
WHEREVER YOU ARE.
OH, WOW.
PRETTY COOL.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OF THE WAYS
YOU CAN USE LUMIO.
OPEN IT AND IT CREATES
A NICE AMBIENT LIGHT.
YOU CAN OPEN IT
ALL THE WAY, 360.
OR USE IT
AS DIRECTIONAL TASK LIGHTING
TO READ OR WRITE.
AND IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE UNITS,
YOU CAN COMBINE THEM TOGETHER.
THIS FIXTURE INSIDE
HAS SUPERSTRONG MAGNETS,
SO YOU CAN CONFIGURE THIS
INTO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS.
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S REALLY COOL.
SO BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
YOU CAN ALSO USE IT
ON ANY VERTICAL SURFACES.
IT JUST HAS TO GO
TO METAL.
CORRECT.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THE BEST WAY TO EXPERIENCE
AND UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCT
IS FOR YOU TO REALLY HOLD IT
IN YOUR HANDS.
YEAH.
I BROUGHT A FEW SAMPLES
WITH ME.
HERE YOU GO, ROBERT.
THANK YOU.
OH!
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, THAT'S SO COOL!
SO, MAX, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
BATTERY-OPERATED.
HOW LONG
DO THE BATTERIES LAST FOR?
EIGHT HOURS,
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA.
I DON'T WANT TO JUST DESIGN
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.
I WANT IT FUNCTIONAL.
SO EIGHT HOURS IS ENOUGH POWER
TO LAST YOU OVERNIGHT.
IT'S RECHARGEABLE
THROUGH MICRO USB.
IT TAKES
ABOUT THREE TO FOUR HOURS
TO GET THE FULL CAPACITY
OF EIGHT HOURS.
John: THIS IS COOL.
SO, MAX, IT BRINGS A SMILE
TO YOUR FACE WHEN YOU OPEN IT.
TELL ME YOUR VISION
BEHIND THE APPLICATION OF IT.
THIS IS A LIGHTING SOLUTION
THAT YOU CAN USE
AROUND THE HOUSE
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER,
BUT ALSO, I THINK
OUTDOOR MARKET IS HUGE.
WE LAUNCHED JUST LAST YEAR.
WE DID $1 MILLION WITHOUT
ANY ADVERTISING, MARKETING.
$1 MILLION?
CORRECT.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
WE GOT CLOSE TO $580,000
ON KICKSTARTER.
WOW.
WOW.
WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL?
$60,000.
WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?
CURRENTLY,
WE'RE SELLING $190 PER UNIT.
$190?
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?
RIGHT NOW,
WE ARE AT $65.
DAYMOND, FIRST YEAR,
OUR COST OF GOODS WAS $80.
IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS,
WE ARE ABLE
TO LOWER IT DOWN TO $65.
I LIVED IN THE FACTORY
FOR FOUR MONTHS.
WHAT COUNTRY?
I HAD TO GO TO CHINA.
SO THAT YOU COULD
WATCH THE PROCESS
AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO IMPROVE IT?
EXACTLY.
IT LOOKS SIMPLE, BUT IT'S
ALL ABOUT THE DETAILING.
YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN GET
THAT $65 PRICE WAY DOWN?
CORRECT.
TO WHAT?
YEAH, TO WHAT?
THE IDEAL FOR ME IS $50,
WHICH IS 33% OF REVENUE.
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
MOST OF THESE?
MUSEUM OF MODERN ART
IN NEW YORK,
MOCA IN L.A., SFMOMA,
COOPER HEWITT,
AND WE DO HAVE
AN E-COMMERCE,
AND THAT'S ALSO
40% OF THE SALES.
RIGHT NOW,
PART OF THE PAIN POINT
IS WE CANNOT KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.
OKAY, SO, YOU'RE LIMITING
YOUR DISTRIBUTION
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.
EXACTLY.
O'Leary: WHAT ABOUT
LIGHTING DISTRIBUTORS?
ANYBODY APPROACH YOU AND SAY,
"LOOK, I WANT TO SUPPORT
THE 10,000 LIGHTING STORES
IN AMERICA"?
THEY <i>HAVE</i> APPROACHED ME,
BUT HERE'S MY VISION --
I WANT TO BUILD A BRAND.
THIS YEAR, THE FOCUS
IS TO PARTNER WITH GREAT BRANDS.
I FOCUS ON
THE BRAND-BUILDING COMPANIES
THAT I WANT TO WORK WITH.
WHAT STORES IN THE U.S.
WOULD YOU ACTUALLY SELL IT?
GIVE ME SOME BRANDS
OUTSIDE OF THE MUSEUM STORES.
I THINK DESIGN WITHIN REACH
WOULD BE A GREAT FIT.
BUT ARE YOU PLANNING
ON EXPANDING
INTO A BROADER BASE
OF RETAILERS?
I'M LOOKING INTO THAT
NEXT YEAR.
YOU KNOW,
YOU CANNOT BE TOO GREEDY,
AND I DON'T WANT TO DILUTE
THE BRAND.
ARE YOU SAYING TO KEVIN,
"YOU CANNOT BE TOO GREEDY"?
[ LAUGHTER ]
Cuban: MAX, KEEP ON TELLING US
ABOUT YOUR VISION.
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT FOLLOWS THIS. WHAT'S NEXT?
SO, I'VE CREATED
THIS PROTOTYPE.
SO, IT'S A MINI VERSION.
John: MM!
Cuban: WOW.
Herjavec: WOW!
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ASKED
BY OUR DISTRIBUTOR IN JAPAN,
AND THEY SAY,
"EVERYONE IS ASKING
Greiner: CAN I SEE IT?
ABOUT THE MINI VERSION."
SO, IT'S A LITTLE
NIGHT-LIGHT.
CORRECT.
SO, IF THIS IS
MORE FOR USE AROUND THE HOUSE,
I WANT THIS
TO LIVE IN YOUR BAG.
AND THESE DAYS,
EVERYONE WHO IS MOBILE,
YOU'RE ALWAYS
RUNNING OUT OF JUICE.
NOW,
THIS HAS THE CAPABILITY
FOR YOU TO RECHARGE
ALL YOUR MOBILE DEVICES.
O'Leary:
SO, THIS YEAR'S SALES,
IF EVERYTHING KEEPS GOING
WITH YOUR CONTROLLED CHANNELS,
HAVE YOU ESTIMATED
WHAT YOUR SALES WILL BE?
YES -- CONSERVATIVE, $2 MILLION.
$2.5, VERY DOABLE.
AND WHAT WILL YOU MAKE ON THAT,
DO YOU THINK
15%.
I MEAN,
I THINK THIS WOULD BE GREAT
IN THE SLS OR THE W's ROOMS,
AND PEOPLE CAN TAKE THEM.
EXACTLY. I'M STEPPING --
INCHING TOWARDS THAT.
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
EVERY TIME WE OPEN IT,
IT BROUGHT A SMILE TO MY FACE.
I THINK YOU'RE
REALLY ONTO SOMETHING.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLY
IMPRESSIVE GUY.
YOU WENT TO THE FACTORY.
I DON'T THINK WE EVER HAD
ANYBODY COME OUT HERE
AND SAY,
"I GOT A FACTORY IN CHINA,
AND I WENT AND LIVED THERE
FOR FOUR MONTHS."
AND I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE,
AND THAT WAS NOT EASY.
IT'S NOT EASY.
IT'S NOT EASY.
SO, MAX, LET ME START.
YEP.
I SHARE YOUR VISION. I THINK
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH.
AND I THINK YOUR VALUATION
IS PRETTY FAIR.
$250,000 FOR 10%.
SO, ROBERT, I LOVE YOU.
THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
UM, WOULD YOU MIND
IF I ASKED THE OTHER SHARKS
TO SEE
IF THEY ARE INTERESTED,
JUST TO SEE
WHAT THEIR OFFERS ARE?
AND I'M GONNA STRUCTURE
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, OKAY?
HE'S GONNA DO A ROYALTY DEAL.
IT'S SHOCKING, I KNOW.
HERE COMES
THE BLOODSUCKING OFFER.
I'M GONNA HELP YOU,
BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY VALUING
YOUR BUSINESS AT $3.1 MILLION.
WHAT IF I VALUED IT
AT $6 MILLION?
WHOA.
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN.
MAX HAS AN OFFER FROM ROBERT
FOR $250,000
FOR 10% OF HIS INNOVATIVE
LIGHTING COMPANY, LUMIO.
BUT KEVIN
SURPRISINGLY SUGGESTS
A HIGHER VALUATION
FOR THE COMPANY.
YOU'RE BASICALLY VALUING
YOUR BUSINESS AT $3.1 MILLION.
WHAT IF I VALUED IT
AT $6 MILLION?
WHOA.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE $250,000,
AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY IT BACK
TO ME UNTIL I DOUBLE MY MONEY.
YOU'LL PAY ME $7 A UNIT
UNTIL I GET $500,000 BACK.
THEN THAT GOES AWAY
IN PERPETUITY. IT'S GONE.

IN THE COMPANY
FOR PROVIDING THAT,
AND, OF COURSE, I'LL HELP YOU
FINANCE YOUR PURCHASE ORDERS.

WITH A $6.2 MILLION VALUATION.
AND I'VE REFLECTED

THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THIS.
IT'S, UM, THANK YOU --
MAX, WHEN THIS SHOW AIRS,
RIGHT,
THERE'S GONNA BE
AN AMAZING AMOUNT
OF DEMAND
FOR THE PRODUCT.
IS SELLING FROM YOUR WEBSITE
TO "SHARK TANK" VIEWERS

NUMBER-ONE PRIORITY
BECAUSE THE MARGIN

FOR 16%.

ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET,

ENOUGH SKIN IN THE GAME.
IT GIVES YOU CAPITAL TO MAKE
SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH INVENTORY,
'CAUSE I THINK
THIS WILL SELL VERY WELL.
SO, THAT'S MY OFFER --
$500,000 FOR 16%.
VERY GENEROUS OFFER.

TO $350,000 FOR 10%.
SLIGHTLY MORE CASH,
BUT AT THE SAME EQUITY LEVEL.

ALL FIVE SHARKS MADE AN OFFER.
AND I'M VERY, VERY EXCITED,
ESPECIALLY TO WORK WITH ROBERT.
HE'S A GREAT GUY.
SO, HE'S EXACTLY
WHO I WANTED TO PARTNER WITH,
AND I GOT A GREAT DEAL FROM HIM,

Narrator: IN SEASON 5,
ERIN BICKLEY AND JENNY GREER
MADE A DEAL
WITH BARBARA AND LORI
FOR THEIR WOMEN'S SHAPEWEAR
PROJECT, HOLD YOUR HAUNCHES.
I'M OUT.
EVERY TIME THERE'S
A FEMALE PRODUCT ON THIS SHOW,
YOU GUYS GO OUT
RIGHT AWAY.
Greiner: I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
AN OFFER WITH BARB
JUST SO THAT WE CAN SHOW
OUR MALE SHARKS
ABSOLUTELY.
HOW THEY MISSED OUT
ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST SELLERS
OF THIS SEASON.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW.
Greer: IN THE YEAR
LEADING UP TO "SHARK TANK,"
WE ONLY HAD
$165,000 IN SALES.
ERIN, LOOK!
IT'S ONLY BEEN
SIX MONTHS,
AND WE'RE ALREADY
AT $1.5 MILLION IN SALES.
WITH THE SPIKE
IN OUR BUSINESS,
WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE OUT
OF ERIN'S PLAYROOM
AND INTO
THIS WONDERFUL NEW OFFICE,
WHERE WE DO
ALL OF OUR OWN SHIPPING
AND WAREHOUSE
ALL OF OUR PRODUCT.
WHEN WE WERE
IN THE TANK,
MARK, KEVIN, AND ROBERT
DROPPED OUT
BEFORE THEY HEARD
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
WE BET WE KNOW
WHO'S REGRETTING THAT NOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
GEORGIA NATIONAL FAIR RECOGNIZES
JENNY GREER AND ERIN BICKLEY.
Bickley: OUR BUSINESS
HAS BEEN SUCH A SUCCESS
THAT HERE WE ARE
AT THE GEORGIA NATIONAL FAIR,
RECEIVING
THE GEORGIA GROWN AWARD.
WOULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME
WELCOME OUR FAVORITE SHARKS,
LORI AND BARBARA!
Corcoran: I AM SO PROUD
OF JENNY AND ERIN
BECAUSE THEY ARE
A WALKING, TALKING EXAMPLE
OF WHAT WOMEN CAN DO
IN AMERICA.
THE GUYS
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THEM,
BUT THESE TWO SMART WOMEN
BOUGHT IN,
AND NOW LOOK AT THEM.
SORRY, BOYS.
SORRY, BOYS.
Greer: THANK YOU, LORI GREINER
AND BARBARA CORCORAN.
