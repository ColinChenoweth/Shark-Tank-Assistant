MY NAME IS JOE CHAY
FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO,
JOE, TELL US
ABOUT THE GUYS BEHIND YOU.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, THIS IS URIJAH FABER.
URIJAH IS A UFC SUPERSTAR.
SUPERSTAR!
SUPERSTAR.
HE WAS THE W.E.C. CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD,
SO, JOE BASICALLY
IS ALSO KIND OF YOUR STYLIST.
YOU TRUST HIM?
YES.
DO YOU GO TO SOMEONE'S HOME --
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAID,
"I DON'T EVEN LIKE
GOING TO THE STORE."
DO YOU COME IN --
YEAH, THE WAY
THE ASTOR &amp; BLACK MODEL WORKS,
ALL THEIR SALES
WERE DIRECT AGENT --
FORGET THEIR MODEL.
TELL US ABOUT <i>YOUR</i> MODEL.
WELL, IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.
I WOULDN'T BE BORING YOU
WITH THE OLD-NEWS COMPANY
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT
TO MY STORY.
I PROMISE YOU
THERE'S SOMETHING GOOD.
Greiner:
ALL RIGHT, TELL US.
OKAY, GET INTO IT.
GET INTO IT.
OKAY, SO, THINGS WERE TOUGH
WHEN I LEFT.
WHEN I LEFT, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.
I DECIDED
TO OPEN UP BELLO VERDE.
I WAS VERY FORTUNATE --
ASTOR &amp; BLACK WENT UNDER,
JOE, IS IT TRUE --
...ABOUT INCORPORATING
THAT TECHNOLOGY...
THEY WILL HELP YOU.
JOE, THROW ME
A BONE HERE.
I ONLY HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION,
VERY IMPORTANT.
YES.
THIS COMPANY THAT YOU BOUGHT
FOR $405,000 --
HOW MUCH CASH
WILL IT MAKE THIS YEAR?
HOW MUCH CASH DO <i>YOU</i> THINK
IT'LL MAKE THIS YEAR?
YOU MEAN
<i>I</i> HAVE TO ANSWER THAT?
WHAT,
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?
I WAS GONNA ASK YOUR QUESTION
FOR YOU.
YOU TELL <i>ME.</i>
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
JOE,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
MY SALES THIS YEAR
WILL BE $2 MILLION.
ON THE $2 MILLION,
WE'LL NET OVER $500,000.
YOU WANT TO BE IN RETAIL?
Herjavec: SO,
YOU'RE GONNA GO RETAIL, JOE?
OOH.
I'M GOING TO PERHAPS
GIVE IT THE CONSIDERATION,
WITH ONE OF YOUR HELP.
THE OTHER TWO --
WHOLESALE.
I'M GONNA OPEN UP
A WHOLESALE STREAM
TO SELL THIS PRODUCT
TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS.
JOE, I ACTUALLY USE
ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS.
THAT'S WHY
I LOOK SO FABULOUS.
EVERYTHING IS MADE
BY MY TAILOR.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU USE.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU USE.
OKAY,
SO, HERE'S THE PROBLEM
THAT I LOOK AT AS A DISCIPLINED
FINANCIAL INVESTOR.
SURE.
JOE,
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
THERE ARE GUYS LIKE KEVIN
WHO LOVE CUSTOM SUITS,
THAT HAVE FUNNY BODIES,
WEIRD SHAPES.
ADONIS BODIES
REQUIRE A TAILOR.
I CAN THROW A DART
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO --
JOE. JOE.
JOE! SHH!
WE KNOW.
YOU'RE A GOOD SALESPERSON.
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.
OKAY, JOE, GET FOCUSED.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SHARK LEFT.
OKAY, BIG "D,"
WHATCHA GONNA DO?
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER,
Chay: THAT IS A NUMBER
THAT IS SO FAR OFF
FROM WHAT I WOULD ACCEPT
THAT IT'S PROBABLY
NOT EVEN A GOOD IDEA
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
ABOUT IT.
MAKE A COUNTER.
I MEAN, MY COUNTEROFFER
WOULD BE $360,000 FOR 7%.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GUY'S GOT
A LOT OF ROOM TO MOVE.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO COUNTER WITH SOMETHING
THAT'S SOMEWHERE
REALISTIC...
MY BOTTOM LINE
IS $360,000 --
JOE, SAYONARA.
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU GUYS' TIME.
Chay: I THOUGHT THE SHARKS
COULD BE STRATEGIC INVESTORS,
BUT ULTIMATELY,
IF THEY FAIL TO SEE THE VISION
OR GIVE PROPER VALUATION
TO MY BUSINESS,
THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT TYPE
OF PARTNER FOR ME.
