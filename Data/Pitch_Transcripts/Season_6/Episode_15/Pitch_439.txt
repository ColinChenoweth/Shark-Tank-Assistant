THAT EAT, SLEEP PRODUCT
EVERY DAY.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YES, IT IS.
NOT AT ALL.
KEVIN, YOU'RE RAISING VENTURE
AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU'RE NOT
PRODUCT-ORIENTATED.
THIS IS NOT
A VENTURE DEAL.
THIS IS ACTUALLY HELPING YOU
FINANCE YOUR GROWTH.
I KNOW IT'S NOT A VENTURE DEAL.
THAT'S MY POINT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE.
NO, BUT HE WANTS
SOMEBODY TO DO R&amp;D.
HE WANTS SOMEBODY OUT THERE
WHO'S GONNA GO WITH HIM
HAND-IN-HAND
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.
SO, LET'S SUMMARIZE
WHAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE.
ROBERT IS 10%
FOR $250,000.
I'M SAYING
I'LL DO 4% OF THE EQUITY.
I'M VALUATING YOUR BUSINESS
THE HIGHEST, AT $6.2 MILLION.
DAYMOND IS REALLY STEPPING UP
HERE, AT $750,000 FOR 20%,
PLUS $10 MILLION
OF CREDIT.
VERY INTERESTING.
MARK IS AT 16% --
SAME VALUE YOU CAME IN WITH.
HE'S JUST DOUBLING
THE OFFER.
GIVING YOU $500,000
FOR 16%.
LORI, WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?
$250,000 FOR 12%
AND A $250,000 LINE OF CREDIT.
MY NAME IS NEIL,
CO-FOUNDER OF THE NAPWELL.
WE'RE BASED
IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,
AND ARE SEEKING $100,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
THIS IS JUSTIN.
HE'S WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL
A SLEEP ZOMBIE.
[ YAWNS ]
MAYBE
YOU'VE MET HIM BEFORE.
HE'S ON THE SUBWAY,
IN THE LINE AT THE COFFEE SHOP,
AND THE ONE THAT YOU HONK AT
DURING YOUR MORNING COMMUTE.
IN THE U.S.,
TWO OUT OF EVERY FIVE PEOPLE
ARE SLEEP ZOMBIES.
FOR THOSE OF US THAT CAN'T GET
A FULL NIGHT'S REST, WE NAP.
THAT'S WHY WE BUILT NAPWELL,
THE WORLD'S FIRST NAPPING MASK.
WE WANT TO HELP YOU
NAPTIMIZE.
"NAPTIMIZING" MEANS
FALLING ASLEEP GENTLY
AND WAKING UP
FEELING REFRESHED.
YOU SEE,
WHEN YOU SLEEP,
YOUR BODY CYCLES
THROUGH DIFFERENT STAGES.
IF YOU'RE AWOKEN ABRUPTLY
IN A DEEP STAGE OF SLEEP,
YOU GET
A NASTY HEADACHE.
SCIENTISTS CALL THIS FEELING
SLEEP INERTIA,
AND PERHAPS
YOU'VE FELT IT YOURSELF.
IT'S THAT GROGGY FEELING
THAT JUST RUINS
YOUR ENTIRE DAY'S PRODUCTIVITY.
THE NAPWELL
HELPS YOU NAPTIMIZE
BY USING LIGHTS
TO MIMIC A SUNRISE
AND WAKE YOU GRADUALLY.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SET THE TIMER,
AND 10 MINUTES BEFORE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAKE UP,
THE MASK GETS BRIGHTER,
AND IT PREVENTS
THOSE NASTY HEADACHES.
SLEEP IS VITAL
TO A PERSON'S WELL-BEING,
BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP.
WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN HELP
THESE PEOPLE ONE NAP AT A TIME.
SO, WHO WANTS TO JOIN US
AND HELP THE WORLD NAP WELL?
OKAY, WE HAVE
TWO SPECIAL PROTOTYPES
THAT WE WOULD
LOVE YOU TO TRY.
WHO WANTS
TO GIVE IT A SHOT?
THIS IS NOT FOR SLEEPING
AT NIGHT -- ONLY NAPPING?
IT <i>CAN</i> BE USED
FOR SLEEPING AT NIGHT.
HERE --
I'M GONNA HAVE ROBERT DO IT.
SO, THIS GOES
OVER YOUR NOSE?
OVER YOUR NOSE LIKE --
OVER YOUR NOSE.
THAT GOES
ON TOP OF YOUR NOSE.
Greiner:
THE LIGHTS ARE OFF NORMALLY.
Joglekar: CORRECT.
BUT YOU SET IT SO THAT
IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A NAP --
QUIET, LORI.
I'M SLEEPING.
[ LAUGHS ]
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A NAP
FOR 20 MINUTES,
THEN AT THE LAST COUPLE
OF MINUTES,
THE LIGHTS START TO GO
GRADUALLY.
SO,
THE LAST 10 MINUTES.
I MEAN, LOOK,
WE'VE ALL TAKEN POWER NAPS.
SURE.
I'VE NEVER HAD
A BAD POWER NAP.
YOU HAVE? SERIOUSLY?
NO, IF I NAP
IN THE AFTERNOON...
IT MEANS YOU'RE OLD.
...I WAKE UP
FEELING CRABBY.
IT DOES NOT MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.
SO, WHEN YOU SLEEP,
YOUR BODY CYCLES.
IF YOU WAKE UP
IN STAGE 3 AND 4,
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET
THESE GROGGY HEADACHES.
SO, JUSTIN,
THAT'S COMMON SCIENCE, RIGHT?
I MEAN, THEY TEACH YOU ALL THIS
REM SLEEP AND EVERYTHING.
YOU GOT TO GET
CERTAIN CYCLES OF SLEEP.
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
ABOUT THAT.
BUT WHERE ARE YOU
WITH THE COMPANY?
ARE YOU A SCIENTIST?
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
SO, JUSTIN AND I ACTUALLY MET
AT A 7th GRADE SUMMER CAMP.
AT LEAST, WE LIKE
TO CALL IT SUMMER CAMP.
REALLY,
WE MET AT NERD CAMP.
HE WAS LEARNING MEDICINE,
AND I WAS LEARNING PASCAL,
AN OLD
COMPUTER-PROGRAMING LANGUAGE.
AND, SO, THE IDEA WAS
THAT WE'D ALWAYS GO
TO COLLEGE TOGETHER,
BUT HE ENDED UP
GOING TO M.I.T.,
AND I ENDED UP GOING
TO THE WEST COAST, TO STANFORD.
Lee: SO I DID MY UNDERGRAD
AT M.I.T.,
DOUBLED
IN PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY.
WOW.
DID MY MASTER'S THERE
ALSO,
BUT IN
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.
SO RIGHT NOW, THOUGH,
I AM A PhD STUDENT
IN A JOINT M.I.T./HARVARD
MEDICAL SCHOOL PROGRAM
FOR MEDICAL ENGINEERING
AND MEDICAL PHYSICS.
OH, WOW.
AND I JUST WRAPPED UP
A PROJECT
FUNDED BY
THE GATES FOUNDATION
TO DEVELOP DRONES
FOR VACCINE DELIVERY IN AFRICA.
SO, YOU HAVE NO CREDIBILITY,
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
THAT'S
REALLY IMPRESSIVE.
IT IS.
I MEAN,
THAT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE.
HOW DID YOU GO FROM ALL OF THAT
TO MAKING A MASK?
WE SEE STARTUPS AS SORT OF
A SERIES OF TESTS OF HYPOTHESES.
THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS WAS...
WELL SAID.
...CAN WE MAKE
A PHYSICAL PRODUCT?
AND SO
WE BUILT THE PROTOTYPE.
THE SECOND TEST WAS,
"COULD WE GET PEOPLE
WE DIDN'T KNOW
TO BUY THE PRODUCT?"
THAT'S WHY WE DID
THE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN.
SO, OUR GOAL FOR THAT
WAS $30,000.
WE ENDED UP SELLING
ABOUT $52,000 WORTH OF PRODUCT.
WHAT WERE YOU SELLING
PER UNIT?
WE ACTUALLY USED CROWDFUNDING
TO TEST DIFFERENT PRICES.
WE SOLD IT
FROM $50 TO $150.
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.
WHAT TYPE OF TESTING
DID YOU DO
TO SEE
WHETHER OR NOT THIS WORKS?
FROM THE KICKSTARTER FUNDING
ITSELF,
THOSE BACKERS
HAVE BEEN OUR EARLY TESTERS.
SO YOU SENT THEM MASKS.
WE DELIVERED ABOUT 100 MASKS
TO OUR EARLY CUSTOMERS.
AND THEY REPORTED
BACK TO YOU.
CORRECT.
THEY DOCUMENTED
HOW THEY FELT EVERY DAY.
I SLEEP ON AVERAGE
THREE, FOUR HOURS A NIGHT.
I'M ALWAYS TIRED.
REALLY?
ISN'T THE PROBLEM THAT
MOST PEOPLE <i>CAN'T</i> GET TO SLEEP?
THE BASIC PROBLEM IS PEOPLE'S
SLEEPING HABITS IN GENERAL.
SO, WHEN WE WERE FIGURING OUT
HOW WE MIGHT SOLVE THAT PROBLEM,
WE DEBATED
A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.
THE MASK
WASN'T THE FIRST ONE.
WE THOUGHT ABOUT PILLOWS,
WE THOUGHT ABOUT BLANKETS.
SO WE THINK
THERE'S A GAP
IN THE MARKET
FOR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY.
IF YOU WALKED INTO ANY V.C.
IN THE VALLEY
WITH YOUR BACKGROUND,
IF YOU JUST SNEEZE
AND CALL IT A STARTUP,
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
TO RAISE $250,000 TO $300,000.
SO WHY
HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT?
FOR ME, LIKE,
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE.
I'M NEW TO THE -- I'M REALLY NEW
TO THE STARTUP WORLD.
SO, WE REALLY WANTED
TO VALIDATE TO OURSELVES
THAT THIS WAS
A VIABLE PRODUCT.
I'M NOT BUYING THAT,
"WELL, WE JUST DECIDED
"TO SKIP THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GO GRAB SOMEBODY'S MONEY
"TO COME ON 'SHARK TANK'
AND NEGOTIATE A VALUATION
BECAUSE WE'RE DYING
TO HAVE ONE OF THESE SHARKS."
YOU GUYS,
YOU GUYS, WAIT.
I'M NOT BUYING IT, GUYS.
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, OKAY?
John:
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I'M OUT, GUYS.
FOR ME, THE BASICS --
I'M OUT.
OKAY, SO MARK'S OUT.
SO, LET ME
ASK A QUESTION.
LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT THIS,
ALL RIGHT?
I HAVE
A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
BROUGHT TO MARKET
A CONSUMER GOOD, PRODUCT,
OR COMPANY, OKAY?
THAT'S CORRECT.
SO, BETWEEN YOUR PROTOTYPE
AND A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
THAT'S SHIPPING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS' WORTH OF PRODUCT,
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF HURT
THAT HAPPENS,
AND ONE OF THEM
IS THE MARKETING ASPECT OF THIS,
BECAUSE IT LOOKS TO MOST PEOPLE
THAT SEE IT ON THE SHELF
AS A SLEEP MASK THAT THEY'RE
USED TO PAYING $1.99 FOR.
THAT IS A TASK FROM HELL.
IT'S GOING TO BE
REALLY TOUGH.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
TO ME, I THINK PEOPLE HAVE
TROUBLE <i>GOING</i> TO SLEEP.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM WAKING UP.
THERE'S A MILLION DEVICES
OUT THERE TO WAKE UP.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THE PATH TO SUCCESS
IS NEVER IN A STRAIGHT LINE.
YOU GUYS ARE SUPERSMART GUYS.
YOU SHOULD BE EXTREMELY PROUD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
ALL OF THAT BACKGROUND
AND EDUCATION
AND ALL THAT SUFFERING THAT
YOUR PARENTS PUT YOU THROUGH
TO MAKING A SLEEP MASK.
IT'S JUST TOO CHALLENGING.
FOR ALL THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
APPRECIATE IT.
ALL RIGHT,
WHO'S LEFT?
ME. WELL, UM...
...I'M A GUY WHO BELIEVES YOU
SHOULD HAVE PROOF OF CONCEPT,
THEN YOU BUILD A BUSINESS
AND PROVE THAT THE MODEL WORKS.
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
Joglekar: OKAY.
Herjavec:
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
CONGRATS.
I LIKE THEIR ONESIES.
Jonglekur:
I THINK THEY FELT LIKE WE WERE
A PRODUCT IN SEARCH OF A MARKET,
BUT WHAT
THEY DIDN'T REALIZE,
AND WHAT WE PROBABLY
DID A POOR JOB OF EXPLAINING,
IS THAT THE DEMAND
FOR THIS PRODUCT
AND THE MARKET
ARE ENORMOUS,
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T SLEEP,
JUST LIKE ME.
WELL,
THEY SAY THAT THE TURBO
IS BECAUSE I HAVE TWO MODES --
TURBO OR OFF.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, HERE'S MY OFFER.
I'LL GO $100,000
FOR 40%.
THE COMPANY
ISN'T WORTH $500,000.
YEAH, BUT THE COMPANY'S SCALING
FAIRLY QUICKLY WITH NO HELP.
WOULD YOU DO 30%?
NO, IT'S NOT WORTH IT
FOR ME.
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
THE SHARK TANK.
THEY DO.
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH MEAT ON THE BONE
TO PROVE ITS VALUE.
NOW YOU'RE PAYING
THE PRICE.
IS NOT GONNA GO TO SLEEP.
THERE IS NO DOUBT
SHE'S THE REAL DEAL.
FUNCTIONAL BUTTONHOLES
ON EVERY SLEEVE,
HANDPICKED STITCHING
ON EVERY SINGLE SEAM,
AND A WEALTH
OF OTHER CUSTOM OPTIONS.
UH-HUH.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE CARRY THOUSANDS OF FABRICS
FROM THE GREATEST MILLS
ON THE WORLD,
AND WE TAKE UP TO 30
MEASUREMENTS ON YOUR BODY
SO IT FITS PERFECT
EVERY SINGLE TIME.
WHETHER YOU'RE
A 5'6" UFC SUPERSTAR...
Herjavec:
[ Chuckling ] HEY!
URIJAH!
...OR A 6'1" SUPERMAN,
BELLO VERDE WILL MAKE SURE
IT FITS YOU RIGHT.
CAN IT GET ANY BETTER?!
[ LAUGHTER ]
ACTUALLY, IT CAN.
OUR CLOTHING IS CUSTOM-MADE.
SHARKS, WE ARE ON THE VERGE --
THE PRECIPICE --
OF MONUMENTAL GROWTH.
YOU HAVE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE PART OF THAT.
NOW, SHARKS, WHO WANTS
TO LOOK SHARP WITH US?
