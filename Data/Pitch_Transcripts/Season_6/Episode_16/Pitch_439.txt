NED, IF YOU WANT IT DONE RIGHT,
GET A WOMAN TO DO IT.
Cuban: NO, YOU GOT
A RIGHT TO GO AGAIN.
REBOOT, REBOOT.
YEAH? ALL RIGHT.
[ SIGHS ] OKAY.
HELLO, SHARKS.
Sorry.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW <i>I'M</i> NERVOUS.
OH, MY GOD.
HE -- I COULDN'T
SAY IT, EITHER.
OKAY, NEXT!
Ned: WAIT, LET'S DO THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M JEN.
Ned: IT'S SIMPLE,
IT'S ECO-FRIENDLY,
I KNOW I'M GETTING MY CALLS
RETURNED, OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL EVER
ACCEPT THE PREMISE
THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE,
BUT I'LL GET THE MEETINGS.
IF WE CAN ACHIEVE A LICENSE
DEAL, I'LL GIVE YOU $300,000.
THE ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED
IN SIX SEASONS --
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A SHARK
ON YOUR TEAM.
ABSOLUTELY.
UM...CAN I CONFER WITH NED
FOR A MINUTE?
OF COURSE.
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ]
OKAY.
WE COULD HAVE
NEVER IMAGINED,
THE WAY THAT THE RULES ARE
OUTLINED IS THAT AFTER A YEAR
OF HOLDING A CROWDFUNDED
EQUITY INVESTMENT,
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BE ABLE TO SELL IT.
YEAH, TO WHO?
THAT'S -- IT'S -- T-THIS IS
ONE OF THE MARKET RISKS.
EXACTLY.
LET ME JUST JUMP IN
FOR A MINUTE.
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE
ONLINE WITH A BUNCH
OF OTHER PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.
DESIGNED TO SANITIZE
SOMETHING WE USE EVERY DAY.
WELL, REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
MARK CUBAN
HAS OFFERED $300,000
FOR 20% OF THEIR PHONE-CLEANSING
DEVICE PHONESOAP,
BUT LORI WANTS IN
ON THE ACTION.
Cuban: $300,000.
YOU HAVE HIS OFFER,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MINE.
Herjavec: WELL, REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.
SO, I SAW THE "DR. OZ"
THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT
WHAT'S ON THE PHONES, RIGHT?
PRETTY SCARY.
I'VE SOLD MILLIONS
IN CELLPHONE CASES,
