AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
AND I'M NED.
AND WE ARE THE FOUNDERS
OF GreenBox.
WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU
FOR A $300,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A
10% EQUITY STAKE IN OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, BASED ON
OUR CONSUMPTIONS...
SHARKS, BASED ON
OUR CONSUMPTIONS...
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S PIZZA.
Corcoran:
IT'S ALL RESEARCH.
DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY.
TAKE A BREATH.
BASED -- SORRY, GUYS.
SHARKS,
BASED ON OUR RESEARCH...
JEN, STOP
MAKING HIM NERVOUS.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, MY GOD.
DON'T WORRY. IT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE.
SHUT UP, KEVIN.
EXACTLY!
WHY DON'T YOU REBOOT?
STEP BACK AND REBOOT.
Greiner: DO YOU WANT TO TRY IT
AGAIN? YEAH, DO IT AGAIN.
NED, IF YOU WANT IT DONE RIGHT,
GET A WOMAN TO DO IT.
Cuban: NO, YOU GOT
A RIGHT TO GO AGAIN.
REBOOT, REBOOT.
YEAH? ALL RIGHT.
[ SIGHS ] OKAY.
HELLO, SHARKS.
Sorry.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW <i>I'M</i> NERVOUS.
OH, MY GOD.
HE -- I COULDN'T
SAY IT, EITHER.
OKAY, NEXT!
Ned: WAIT, LET'S DO THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M JEN.
AND I'M NED, AND WE ARE
THE FOUNDERS OF GreenBox.
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU
FOR A $300,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A
10% EQUITY STAKE IN OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT,
BASED ON CONSUMPTION,
PEOPLE LIKE PIZZA
EVEN MORE THAN THEY LIKE SEX.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM
WITH PIZZA
IS THAT PIZZA BOXES
ARE JUST TOO CUMBERSOME.
ALL OF US HAVE STRUGGLED
TO CRAM AN ENTIRE PIZZA BOX
INTO THE FRIDGE
AND THEN INTO THE GARBAGE CAN.
IT'S AN AGE-OLD PROBLEM
THAT'S NEVER BEEN FIXED.
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT,
THE GreenBox,
OFFERS A REVOLUTIONARY,
ECO-FRIENDLY SOLUTION
FOR ALL THESE PROBLEMS.
SO, WHAT IS A GreenBox?
THE GreenBox
IS A PIZZA BOX
MADE FROM 100%
RECYCLED MATERIAL.
THE TOP OF THE BOX
TEARS OFF
AND BREAKS DOWN
INTO FOUR STURDY PLATES.
THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR
ADDITIONAL DISPOSABLE PLATES,
AND IT NEGATES THE NEED
FOR CLEANING UP,
WHICH NO ONE EVER ENJOYS.
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE THERE.
THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX
FOLDS INTO A HANDY STORAGE
CONTAINER FOR LEFTOVERS.
THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED
FOR ADDITIONAL STORAGE MATERIALS
LIKE ALUMINUM FOIL
AND PLASTIC WRAP.
IT FITS NEATLY
IN THE FRIDGE.
Herjavec: OH!
Corcoran:
WOW! NICELY DONE.
AND WHEN
YOU'RE DONE EATING...
Cuban: THAT'S COOL.
Greiner: VERY CLEVER.
...IT FITS
IN THE GARBAGE CAN.
Ned: IT'S SIMPLE,
IT'S ECO-FRIENDLY,
AND IT HAS MASS APPEAL.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY
FOR A SLICE OF THE PIE?
WE ALL ARE.
WE ALL ARE, YEAH.
[ JEN CHUCKLES ]
THERE YOU GO.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THERE YOU GO, LORI.
THANK YOU.
AND, MARK,
WE DID NOT FORGET ABOUT YOU.
THIS IS
GLUTEN-FREE PIZZA.
I LIKE IT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE STORAGE CONTAINER.
PERFECTO.
JEN, IT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA.
NEVER SEEN SOMETHING SO CLEVER
FOR THE PIZZA BOX.
BUT HERE'S THE CHALLENGE --
WHO ARE YOU GONNA SELL IT TO?
WE SELL TO DISTRIBUTORS
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
OUR BUSINESS MODEL, FROM
DAY ONE, WAS A DUAL STRATEGY.
NUMBER ONE,
PROVE OUT THE CONCEPT.
WE WANTED
TO SHOW THE WORLD
THAT THIS IS
A VIABLE PIZZA BOX,
IT HAS
STRUCTURE INTEGRITY,
THAT CUSTOMERS
WILL ACTUALLY LIKE IT,
AND THEN MOVE TO
A LICENSING MODEL.
WE'VE ACHIEVED PHASE ONE.
TELL US HOW YOU THINK --
WHY YOU THINK
YOU'VE ACHIEVED PHASE 1.
WE HAVE DISTRIBUTORS
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
OUR LARGEST CUSTOMER
IS WHOLE FOODS.
WE'RE IN
HALF THE REGIONS.
REALLY?
IS THERE A PATENT ON THIS?
YES, WE HAVE A FULL UTILITY
PATENT. IT'S FULLY ISSUED.
HOW MANY PIZZA BOXES
HAVE YOU SOLD IN YOUR CHANNEL?
DIRECT SALES --
OVER 10 MILLION.
10 MILLION PIZZA BOXES?
YES, AND OVER --
THROUGH LICENSING,
WE'VE SOLD WAY OVER 10 MILLION.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR?
$1.7 MILLION LAST YEAR.
GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
Herjavec:
THAT'S AWESOME.
JEN, IF I WAS DOMINO'S,
HOW MUCH MORE WOULD THEY PAY
FOR THIS MUCH BETTER BOX?
A FRACTION OF A PENNY.
I'M A SHAREHOLDER OF A COMPANY
CALLED BOSTON PIZZA.
YES.
HAS 650 LOCATIONS.
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT?
I BROUGHT THEM A SIMILAR IDEA --
NOT AS CREATIVE, ACTUALLY --
AND IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE
A FRACTION OF A PENNY.
AND GEORGE, THE ACCOUNTANT,
SAID TO ME,
"IS IT GOING TO HELP ME SELL
ONE MORE PIZZA?"
AND THEN IT WAS ALSO
AN ECO-FRIENDLY THING,
THE -- THE LICENSER SAID BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE GONNA FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THE BOX BECAUSE
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.
AND THEN GEORGE SAID,
"THEN I HAVE TO SPEND
A COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN
"TO EXPLAIN
WHAT I'VE DONE WITH THE BOX,
"AND THAT COSTS ME MORE MONEY.
I HATE IT.
TELL ME HOW I CAN SAVE A CENT,
NOT <i>INCREASE</i> MY COSTS."
IF YOU LOOK AT A COMPANY
LIKE PIZZA HUT,
LIKE DOMINO'S,
LIKE PAPA JOHNS,
THEY SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN MARKETING.
AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT
THE VIRAL LEVEL OF INTEREST
IN OUR PRODUCT,
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
TO EVEN PUT TOGETHER
A HUGE MARKETING CAMPAIGN.
THAT'S A TOUGH SALE
WHEN YOU'RE SELLING MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF PIZZAS.
ONE HALF OF ONE CENT PER BOX
ACROSS 100 MILLION PI-PIZZAS
IS A LOT OF MONEY.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary: CAN WE FOCUS
ON THE BIG OPPORTUNITY?
LET'S PICK ANY ONE.
LET'S GO DOMINO'S.
TENS OF MILLIONS OF PIZZAS
A QUARTER.
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT ANY DEAL?
NO, WE -- WE HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS
TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE THERE.
WE'VE RESPONDED TO THE DEMAND
THAT WE'VE HAD.
I ACTUALLY KNOW THE GUYS THERE.
I MEAN, BUT --
SO COME ON BOARD.
WELL, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY
UNLESS YOU CAN SELL
100 MILLION BOXES.
AND WE CAN. THIS --
SO PUT YOUR MONEY
WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS.
O'Leary: NO.
WELL, YOU SOUND LIKE YOU HAVE
A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA.
HE THINKS HE HAS EXPERTISE
IN EVERYTHING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
O'Leary:
AND THE PROBLEM IS, HE DOES.
AND HE'S BEEN IN EVERY BUSINESS
IN THE WORLD.
I'LL MAKE --
LOOK, I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
BUT IT'S SO CLEAR ON WHAT
THE PATH IS, AND IT'S BINARY,
AND IT'S COMPLETELY CONTINGENT
ON GETTING ONE OF THE MAJORS
TO -- TO LICENSE THIS
'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'D EVER MAKE ANY MONEY.
I'LL MAKE THE CALLS.
I KNOW I'M GETTING MY CALLS
RETURNED, OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL EVER
ACCEPT THE PREMISE
THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE,
BUT I'LL GET THE MEETINGS.
IF WE CAN ACHIEVE A LICENSE
DEAL, I'LL GIVE YOU $300,000.
AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME 10% OF
THE COMPANY AFTER IT'S SIGNED,
AND I'M GOING TO GET
THE FIRST $300,000 BACK
FROM THE ROYALTY STREAM
ON THAT ONE DEAL.
SO, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
HE GIVES YOU $300,000,
YOU PAY HIM BACK, AND AFTER
HE'S PAID BACK, HE OWNS 10%.
BUT IF HE DOESN'T DO THAT,
YOU GET NOTHING.
RIGHT,
BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING NOW.
SO, ROBERT AND I ARE GOING
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.
KEVIN HAS MADE AN OFFER
OF $300,000 AS A LOAN
FOR 10% EQUITY
FOR THE FUNCTIONAL-PIZZA-BOX
COMPANY GreenBox.
HOWEVER, IT'S CONTINGENT
ON MAKING A DEAL
WITH A MAJOR PIZZA COMPANY.
BUT ROBERT AND LORI
MAY HAVE A COMPETING OFFER.
SO, ROBERT AND I ARE GOING
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I DO AGREE WITH KEVIN
ON ONE ASPECT.
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO AGREE
WITH KEVIN ON ANYTHING,
SO I HAVE A HARD TIME
GETTING THAT OUT.
AND HE'S ALWAYS RIGHT.
WHAT CAN YOU DO?
IT -- IT IS BINARY.
AS AN INVESTOR,
WE REALLY WANT TO GO BOOM.
WE WANT TO SCALE IT UP.
AND I THINK YOU AGREE
THAT TO SCALE IT UP,
YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN FRONT
OF A LARGE PIZZA COMPANY.
THE ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED
IN SIX SEASONS --
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A SHARK
ON YOUR TEAM.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND IT'S BETTER
TO HAVE TWO.
YES.
RIGHT, AND WE CAN ALL
GET A CALL ANSWERED
FROM ONE OF
THE MAJOR PIZZA COMPANIES.
OUR DEAL IS CONTINGENT
ON ONE OF THE LARGE PIZZA
COMPANIES COMING ON BOARD.
BUT THAT'S JUST A BIG --
WE FEEL CONFIDENT
WE'LL MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
YEAH, AND WE THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
WE'LL GIVE YOU
THE $300,000 FOR 30%.
OUCH.
Cuban: OH.
Greiner: BUT WE WILL
BE WITH YOU THE WHOLE WAY.
OUCH.
THAT'S A LOT OF EQUITY.
WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT
THAT WE WILL GET YOU INTO ONE OF
THOSE MAJOR PIZZA CHAINS.
SO YOU HAVE ONE DEAL FOR 10%,
ONE DEAL FOR 30%?
HOW COULD YOU
EVEN COMPARE THEM?
BUT YOU HAVE TO
PAY HIM BACK.
HERE'S HOW
I SEE THE PRODUCT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT THIS IS A SPECIAL BOX,
LOOKING AT THE OUTSIDE.
YOU HAVE TO OPEN IT UP TO FIND
OUT WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT.
SO, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE
IN THE PRODUCT ENOUGH, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
YOU GUYS GOT TWO OFFERS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
UM...CAN I CONFER WITH NED
FOR A MINUTE?
OF COURSE.
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ]
OKAY.
WELL, WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK
LORI AND ROBERT FOR THE OFFER.
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT
KEVIN'S OFFER.
WOW. MIRACLES HAPPEN.
[ APPLAUSE ]
O'Leary: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SMART MOVE. I'D NEVER SAY
IT'S A SMART MOVE WHEN
YOU'RE IN BUSINESS WITH KEVIN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
REALLY.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
IT STILL AMAZES ME WHEN ANYBODY
DOES A DEAL WITH YOU, KEVIN.
IT IS SHOCKING.
REALLY IS SHOCKING.
ROBERT,
YOU TABLED AN INFERIOR DEAL
BECAUSE YOU'VE
NO CREATIVITY.
YOU KNOW, I'M GIVING
ALL MY TRADE SECRETS AWAY
TO YOUR SHARKS.
IT'S JUST SCARY.
Jen:
WE TOOK KEVIN'S OFFER TODAY
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
IN OUR COMPANY,
WE BELIEVE
THAT IT'S GONNA GROW,
WE BELIEVE
IT'S GONNA BE THE STANDARD,
SO WE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE UP
THAT MUCH OF A STAKE.
Narrator: IN SEASON 5,
BRIAN AND JULIE WHITEMAN
MADE A DEAL WITH KEVIN O'LEARY
FOR THEIR SUBSCRIPTION
PHOTO-PRINTING SERVICE,
GrooveBook.
CHOOSE UP TO 100 PHOTOS
EVERY MONTH FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE
AND CREATE A BEAUTIFUL, BOUND
PHOTO BOOK IN JUST MINUTES.
LET'S SEE
HOW THEY'RE DOING NOW.
Julie: SINCE MAKING OUR DEAL
ON "SHARK TANK,"
OUR BUSINESS
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.
OUR SUBSCRIBER BASE
HAS GROWN 15 TIMES
SINCE THE DAY
WE AIRED ON "SHARK TANK."
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.
O'Leary:
I'M HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
WITH BRIAN AND JULIE
FROM GrooveBook.
I ALWAYS KNEW SOMETHING HUGE WAS
GONNA HAPPEN WITH THIS COMPANY,
AND TODAY IS THE DAY
IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.
KEVIN,
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WE'RE MEETING WITH SHUTTERFLY,
THE MARKET LEADER
IN PERSONALIZED,
DIGITAL-PHOTO PRODUCTS.
SHUTTERFLY DOES
OVER $900 MILLION IN REVENUE.
THEY'VE GOT
TENS OF MILLIONS OF USERS,
AND GrooveBook HAS
A FANTASTIC PRODUCT.
IT'S A PERFECT MARRIAGE.
WE'D LIKE TO MAKE
A FINAL OFFER
IN THE AMOUNT
OF $14.5 MILLION.
WOW.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
THE GrooveBook BRAND
HAS GROWN IN WAYS
WE COULD HAVE
NEVER IMAGINED,
AND TODAY,
WE'RE FINALLY READY TO SELL.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
LET'S DO IT.
Brian: WHEN WE PITCHED
ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE BARELY HAD ANY SALES.
AND TODAY,
A YEAR AFTER OUR DEAL,
WE'RE SELLING GrooveBook
FOR $14.5 MILLION.
Housenbold: ALL RIGHT.
[ APPLAUSE ]
THE GrooveBook DEAL
IS THE LARGEST DEAL EVER
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY.
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE, AND
I FEEL WARM AND FUZZY INSIDE.
AND I'M HERE NOW
WITH SHARK KEVIN O'LEARY.
I GUESS I SHOULD SAY
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU SAW THIS ONE EARLY.
WE JUST CLOSED THE BIGGEST DEAL
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY,
AND I'M HERE ON THE SET
OF "GOOD MORNING AMERICA"
TO TELL THE WHOLE WORLD
ABOUT IT.
EVEN YOU COULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED
THIS KIND OF BREAKOUT SUCCESS.
NO, BUT IT TAUGHT ALL OF US
WHAT A PLATFORM "SHARK TANK" IS.
THIS YOUNG FAMILY
HAS JUST PROVEN
THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS STILL ALIVE.
THIS HAS REALLY BEEN
LIFE-CHANGING FOR OUR FAMILY,
AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO SPENDING TIME WITH THEM
AND TRAVELING THE WORLD.
IT JUST SHOWS
YOU SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP
AND PURSUE YOUR DREAMS.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS
WHAT THE ENTREPRENEUR BELIEVES
IS A GAME CHANGER
IN REAL-ESTATE INVESTING.
HI, SHARKS.
THE WAY THAT THE RULES ARE
OUTLINED IS THAT AFTER A YEAR
OF HOLDING A CROWDFUNDED
EQUITY INVESTMENT,
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BE ABLE TO SELL IT.
YEAH, TO WHO?
THAT'S -- IT'S -- T-THIS IS
ONE OF THE MARKET RISKS.
EXACTLY.
LET ME JUST JUMP IN
FOR A MINUTE.
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE
ONLINE WITH A BUNCH
OF OTHER PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.
THAT SEEMS, TO ME,
RISKY AND UNCOMFORTABLE.
AND FOR THAT SIMPLE REASON,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I THINK THE ACHILLES' HEEL
IN THIS --
AND IT COMES FROM YEARS
OF INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE --
IS YOUR LEAD INVESTOR.
WHO IS THE LEAD INVESTOR?
HOW SMART ARE THEY?
HOW DO THEY
WORK THE ANGLES?
WHAT KIND OF FINANCING
DO THEY PROVIDE?
AND I BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S THE KEY
TO ANY GREAT
REAL-ESTATE INVESTMENT.
MM-HMM.
THIS IS
A MYSTERY INVESTOR HERE.
HOW DO I KNOW
HE'S GOT A GOOD EYE?
HOW DO I BELIEVE
HIS PROJECTIONS?
TOO SPOOKY
AND, FRANKLY, UNFAIR
TO SOMEONE
WHO ISN'T WELL-INFORMED
IN THE REAL-ESTATE BUSINESS
AND EXPERIENCED.
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND THAT'S WHY WE DO THE VETTING
TO MAKE SURE WE ONLY WORK WITH
TOP PEOPLE.
YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST THE OPINION
OF WHO'S BEHIND IT,
AND THAT'S WHAT'S SCARY, AND
THAT'S WHY I'M DEFINITELY OUT.
OKAY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY CRIMINAL RECORD
WHATSOEVER?
[ CORCORAN LAUGHS ]
NO. NO, I DON'T.
YOU'RE IN MY SPACE.
I'M IN FINANCIAL SERVICES.
YEP. I-I KNOW YOU HAVE
A MORTGAGE COMPANY YOU STARTED.
I KNOW
WHAT THE BURDEN IS...
MM-HMM.
...TO BE THE STEWARD
OF PEOPLE'S MONEY.
I HAVE $1 BILLION OF IT
WITH MY NAME ON IT.
MM-HMM.
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
MY INVESTORS DON'T LOSE MONEY.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING HERE
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING TO ME,
AND SO, HERE, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH YOU.
THERE'S GOING TO BE THOUSANDS OF
SITES LIKE TYCOON THAT EMERGE.
MM-HMM.
THEY HAVE NO BRAND.
JUST THINK OF THE NAME, TYCOON!
TYCOON!
I KNOW.
PLEASE. LET ME FINISH.
TYCOON -- WHAT DOES THAT SAY
TO A SMALL INVESTOR?
IT'S A RIP-OFF NAME.
WHEN I STARTED IN 2008
AND CREATED O'LEARY FUNDS,
I HAD NO DOLLARS.
NOW I HAVE $1 BILLION.
MM-HMM.
THE ONLY REASON THAT HAPPENED IS
I HAD A BRAND.
PEOPLE TRUSTED ME.
MAYBE I'M A TOUGH GUY,
BUT I MAKE PEOPLE MONEY
AND I PROTECT THEIR CAPITAL.
MM-HMM.
WHY? 'CAUSE I PUT MY OWN MONEY
IN EVERY DEAL,
AND I CARE <i>A LOT</i>
ABOUT MY OWN MONEY -- A LOT.
YES.
OKAY?
SO, YOU HAVE NO BRAND.
TYCOON MEANS NOTHING TO ANYBODY.
I DO HAVE A BRAND, AND I HAVE
A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS.
MM-HMM.
I'LL GIVE YOU $50,000,
AND I WANT 50%.
I'M GONNA
REBRAND THIS THING.
Herjavec: HE'S MADE YOU
A LEGITIMATE OFFER.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WE ALL MAKE FUN OF KEVIN,
BUT I WILL
TELL YOU THIS --
HE REALLY DOES CARE
ABOUT HIS MONEY.
I WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE HIGHER
THAN 10% WITH THAT.
BUMMER.
YOU THINK
I'M GONNA PUT MY NAME --
HE DOESN'T WANT
YOUR NAME.
I-I-I'M NOT ASKING
FOR YOUR NAME. THIS IS --
BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING!
CORRECT.
I HAVE A PROVEN MODEL
THAT RAISED $1 BILLION
IN 36 MONTHS -- MY NAME.
DESIGNED TO SANITIZE
SOMETHING WE USE EVERY DAY.
WELL, REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
MARK CUBAN
HAS OFFERED $300,000
FOR 20% OF THEIR PHONE-CLEANSING
DEVICE PHONESOAP,
BUT LORI WANTS IN
ON THE ACTION.
Cuban: $300,000.
YOU HAVE HIS OFFER,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MINE.
Herjavec: WELL, REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.
SO, I SAW THE "DR. OZ"
THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT
WHAT'S ON THE PHONES, RIGHT?
PRETTY SCARY.
I'VE SOLD MILLIONS
IN CELLPHONE CASES,
AND I'VE SOLD MILLIONS
IN SPONGE SANITIZERS
THAT LOOK KIND OF LIKE YOURS,
SO I GET THAT THIS IS
A GREAT CONCEPT.
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOU
AN OFFER OF $300,000 AT 15%,
BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE
THIS UNIT, PUT IT ON QVC,
PUT IT IN MY SHOW,
AND SELL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS IN IT LIKE THAT.
IF YOU WANT TO GO CONSUMER,
QVC IS THE DESTINATION.
MORE POWER TO YOU,
RIGHT?
Herjavec:
THROWS YOU UNDER THE BUS.
NO, NOT JUST QVC.
RETAIL -- ALL RETAIL.
IF YOU WANT TO GO RETAIL,
WE ALL HAVE RETAIL CONNECTIONS,
BUT, AGAIN, I SEE THIS MORE
AS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT.
WHY? BECAUSE WE CAN CONTROL
OUR OWN DESTINY.
INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT
OUT THERE
AND WAITING
FOR THE PHONE TO RING
AND HOPING THAT PEOPLE WALK
INTO STORES --
'CAUSE YOU CAN CHARGE
A PREMIUM FOR IT.
IT SENDS THE MESSAGE
TO EVERYBODY WHO WALKS
INTO THOSE DOCTORS' OFFICES
THAT YOU NEED ONE,
RIGHT?
IT'S VALUABLE,
AND IT WORKS.
THE DOCTOR'S USING IT,
IT MUST BE SMART.
RIGHT.
SO THAT'S WHY I SUG--
I SAY, DO IT ALL, GUYS.
I MEAN,
WHY JUST DO DOCTORS' OFFICES?
BUT IT'S TOUGH TO DO ALL, RIGHT?
IT'S TOUGH TO BE GREAT --
OH, NO, IT'S NOT.
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.
YEAH, BUT, LORI,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CREATED A SALES FORCE
THAT WENT OUT
AND SOLD A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
INTO COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATIONS?
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO.
MARK, I HAVE OVER 500 PRODUCTS
IN 17 YEARS.
RIGHT, AND YOU HAVE THAT
SALES FORCE THAT'S GOING ON,
KNOCKING ON DOORS
ALL THE TIME, LORI.
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DO.
RIGHT.
WES, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?
LORI CAME IN AT 15%,
AND YOU'RE AT 20%.
IS THERE...
Cuban: NO.
YOU'LL BE PART OF OUR ENTOURAGE.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BUILDING A COMPANY
AND JUST SELLING
A PRODUCT.
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
$40 MILLION, ALMOST,
IN ALL MY "SHARK TANK" PRODUCTS
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
A GREAT SALES FORCE.
AND THAT SALES FORCE
IS TELEVISION TIME ON QVC.
IT'S NOT, MARK.
IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY THAT.
WE CAME IN AT 7.5%.
15% IS HALF THE VALUATION.
20% IS EVEN MORE
THAN THAT.
IF WE COULD MEET
HALFWAY...
Cuban: WHAT --
I'LL GO TO 10%
IF YOU TAKE MY OFFER RIGHT NOW.
DEAL.
DEAL.
DEAL.
[ APPLAUSE ]
GREAT.
[ CHUCKLES ] WHOO!
LORI.
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN UP
THE MRSA. [ LAUGHS ]
YES.
YES.
I THINK THAT THE CONSUMER'S
GONNA LOVE IT.
WE JUST HAVE TO
EDUCATE THEM.
YEAH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Corcoran: GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: WHEW!
WHEW. BAH!
WE JUST DON'T WANT TO SLOW DOWN
WHERE WE ARE NOW.
AND I THINK MARK'S OFFER
WAS TO KIND OF SLOW DOWN HERE
AND MOVE,
WHEREAS LORI WAS LIKE,
"LET'S KEEP GOING HERE
AND GIVE YOU THE MONEY
TO MOVE HERE."
