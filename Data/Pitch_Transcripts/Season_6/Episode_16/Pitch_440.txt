HI. I'M DAN BARNES.
AND I'M HIS COUSIN WES LaPORTE,
AND WE'RE FROM PROVO, UTAH.
OUR COMPANY IS PHONESOAP,
AND WE'RE SEEKING $300,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 7.5%
OF OUR COMPANY.
IT ALL STARTED
WITH A QUESTION --
WHAT'S DIRTIER -- YOUR CELLPHONE
OR A PUBLIC TOILET?
A PUBLIC TOILET, RIGHT?
WRONG.
IT'S YOUR PERSONAL CELLPHONE.
IN FACT,
THE AVERAGE CELLPHONE
HAS 18 TIMES
MORE HARMFUL BACTERIA
THAN ANY SURFACE
IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM,
AND ONE IN SIX PHONES
WAS FOUND WITH FECAL MATTER.
DISGUSTING.
SO, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO -- STOP TOILET TEXTING?
NO, DAN, YOU USE
PHONESOAP CHARGER.
PHONESOAP CHARGER
USES ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT
TO KILL ALL THE BACTERIA ON
YOUR PHONE IN JUST FIVE MINUTES.
AND IT'S UNIVERSAL,
SO IT CLEANS ANY PHONE
AND IT CHARGES ANY PHONE.
SO, HOW DO OUR PHONES GET
SO DIRTY IN THE FIRST PLACE?
WELL, YOU SEE, WHAT OUR HANDS
TOUCH, OUR PHONES TOUCH.
AND WHILE WE WASH OUR HANDS
TO KEEP HEALTHY,
WE NEVER WASH
OUR PHONES.
THAT'S WHY PHONESOAP'S
THE PERFECT SOLUTION
TO THIS "GROWING" PROBLEM.
IT KILLS 99.999%
OF ALL BACTERIA
AND CAN FIT AND CLEAN
EVEN THE LARGE PHONES.
SHARKS,
WE DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO CEASE ALL
COMMODE COMMUNICATION...
[ LAUGHS ]
...BUT WE DO NEED
YOUR HELP
TO START
A CLEAN-PHONE REVOLUTION.
AMEN, DANIEL.
[ HERJAVEC LAUGHS ]
DO WE GET TO SEE SAMPLES?
I'LL BRING ONE RIGHT UP.
WHY WOULDN'T
I JUST USE SANITIZER?
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
THANK YOU.
SO, ALCOHOL, OBVIOUSLY,
KILLS BACTERIA,
BUT IT REALLY DOES
TWO THINGS.
IT CAN DAMAGE THE PHONE
AND VOID THE WARRANTY.
OH, THAT IS
A HORRIBLE RESPONSE.
CAN YOU USE A SANITIZER
ON A TYPICAL CELLPHONE?
YES! OF COURSE, YOU CAN.
WELL, HERE'S
THE REASON WHY --
HERE'S THE REASON
WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO,
IS BECAUSE THERE'S
AN OLEOPHOBIC COATING
THAT SHIPS
WITH ALL YOUR PHONES.
AND IF YOU USE
A CHEMICAL CLEANER ON IT,
IT STRIPS THAT COATING,
SO YOUR FINGERPRINTS STICK
TO THE SCREEN MORE.
LOOK, FOR THAT VALUATION,
YOU MUST HAVE SOME SALES, RIGHT?
YEAH, SO, WE'VE SOLD,
IN THE LAST 5 1/2 MONTHS,
$537,000 IN SALES.
YOU HAVE?
HOW MUCH DO
EACH ONE OF THESE COST?
$59.95.
SO, YOU SELL IT FOR $59.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU TO MAKE?
IT COSTS US $20
TO MAKE IT.
OKAY, WHERE
ARE YOU SELLING THIS?
WE STARTED MOSTLY ONLINE,
AND WE'VE GOT A LARGE
OFFICE-SUPPLY COMPANY, STAPLES.
OH, YOU HAVE IT
IN STAPLES.
HOW MANY STORES
IN STAPLES?
WE'RE IN 400 STORES.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND,
GUYS?
WE STARTED THIS, ACTUALLY,
IN COLLEGE. WE'RE COUSINS.
AT THE TIME, I WAS DOING
CANCER RESEARCH IN A LAB,
AND DAN TOLD ME ABOUT
THIS ARTICLE HE READ
THAT OUR PHONES ARE 18 TIMES
DIRTIER THAN A PUBLIC RESTROOM.
I SWABBED ALL THESE
DIFFERENT SURFACES
AND FOUND THAT, YEAH,
MY PHONE REALLY IS THAT DIRTY.
WE USE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHTS
IN THE LAB TO SANITIZE SURFACES,
SO WE TOOK THAT TECHNOLOGY,
MARRIED IT TO A CHARGER
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
ALREADY CHARGING YOUR PHONE,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL CLEAN IT
AT THE SAME TIME.
SO THERE'S --
I'M GONNA GUESS THAT THERE'S
NO PATENT YOU CAN GET ON THIS
'CAUSE CLEANING DEVICES
OF THIS KIND ARE EVERYWHERE.
SO, WE ACTUALLY HAVE
TWO UTILITY PATENTS SUBMITTED.
I BET YOU
OUR AVERAGE PHONE HERE,
IF YOU SWABBED IT,
WOULD BE DISGUSTING.
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER
IS RELATIVELY LAZY,
AND I'M NOT SURE THEY SEE THIS
AS A MAJOR ISSUE
THAT THEY ARE WILLING
TO SPEND MONEY ON.
YEAH, ROBERT,
I THINK IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE.
BECAUSE OUR PHONES
ARE PORTABLE,
OUR CHARGING DEVICES
HAVE ALSO BECOME VERY PORTABLE.
WELL, WE -- WE'VE SEEN
A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS
PUT IT IN THEIR OFFICE --
LIKE, AT THEIR DESK,
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS
MOST PEOPLE ARE GONNA PAY
30 BUCKS FOR A CHARGER
OR A CASE.
NO!
AND THEY LOOK FORWARD
TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE --
OH, 30 BUCKS?
YOU GOT TO CONVINCE PEOPLE
THAT THEIR PHONE IS A CESSPOOL.
AND YOU HAVE TO
CONVINCE THEM
NOT TO USE PURELL
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
I'M STRUGGLING 'CAUSE
YOU'VE SOLD HALF A MILLION,
SO MAYBE I'M WRONG.
MAYBE YOU'VE FOUND
A SEGMENT OF THE MARKET
THAT'S REALLY ANAL ABOUT THIS.
SO, WE'VE SPENT
A LOT OF MONEY
TO DO FOCUSED
AND TARGETED MARKETING,
SO WE'RE STARTING FIRST
WITH THE --
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU SPENT?
THIS YEAR, WE'VE SPENT
ABOUT $80,000 IN MARKETING.
WOW.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU RAISED
IN TOTAL?
WE'VE RAISED $800,000,
SO --
Cuban: OH!
$800,000?
$800,000?
ON KICKSTARTER?
Barnes:
IT WAS FROM A LOCAL INVESTOR.
WE GAVE UP
60% OF OUR COMPANY.
60%?
SO, THE QUESTION
IS WHY?
YES.
WE WERE
TWO ENTREPRENEURS
THAT REALLY HAD AN IDEA
THAT WE LOVED.
WE HIT THE POINT
WHERE IT WAS LIKE,
"IT'S GONNA COST US
A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE IT,"
AND WE DECIDED IT WAS EITHER BE
GREEDY AND HAVE THIS GO NOWHERE
OR GIVE OURSELVES
AN OPPORTUNITY --
Cuban: OH, THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.
THE PROBLEM IS
UNLESS YOU GET THAT P.R. POP,
IT'S GONNA BE VERY,
VERY EXPENSIVE TO SUSTAIN.
SO, YOUR SALES
PROBABLY GO LIKE THIS, RIGHT?
IT'S A NICHE PRODUCT.
YOU-YOU'RE NOT
A COMPANY YET.
RIGHT.
ONE THING WE'VE UNCOVERED
IS THAT THERE'S A HUGE MARKET
IN HOSPITAL AND SCHOOLS.
BUT, GUYS,
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF SANITIZERS
THAT HOSPITALS USE
FOR THEIR DEVICES.
THERE'S A WHOLE PROTOCOL
THAT THEY GO THROUGH.
SURE. WELL, HOSPITALS HAVE
STARTED REACHING OUT TO US
TO COME
PRESENT THE PRODUCT,
AND IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE STARTING TO DEPLOY
LOTS OF TABLETS
INTO THE HOSPITALS.
THEY USE THEM
WHEN THEY GO INTO THE ROOM.
WES, I GOT TO TELL YOU, I...
[ SIGHS ]
I DON'T SEE IT.
I DON'T NEED A TANNING BED
FOR MY PHONE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE HOSPITAL APPLICATION.
WHAT'S THE LOWEST COST
YOU CAN GET,
AND CAN YOU GET IT SO IT CLEANS
IN UNDER A MINUTE?
YEAH, THERE'S THREE PARAMETERS
THAT YOU NEED
FOR EFFECTIVE U.V. KILLING.
ONE OF THE THEM
IS THE PROXIMITY.
THE FURTHER AWAY
YOU MOVE THE LIGHT
FROM THE SURFACE,
IT DECREASES.
ALSO THE INTENSITY
AND THE DURATION.
AND SO YOU CAN PLAY WITH
THOSE THREE FACTORS,
AND IF YOU CAN GET THE LIGHT
CLOSE ENOUGH
AT THE RIGHT INTENSITY,
THEN YOU CAN REDUCE THE TIME.
NOW YOU'VE GOT
MY INTEREST, RIGHT?
A PRODUCT FOR CONSUMER
FOR PHONESOAP -- PBHT!
BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON
WHO GOES TO VISIT
ANYBODY IN THE HOSPITAL
BRINGS THEIR PHONE.
RIGHT.
RIGHT.
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
SELLING PROCESS.
IT IS A DIFFERENT
SELLING PROCESS.
I'VE INVESTED IN COMPANIES
THAT SELL TO HOSPITALS.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LONG --
YES, I DO. YES, I DO.
'CAUSE I'VE GOT COMPANIES
THAT SELL TO HOSPITALS, AS WELL.
THAT IS BRUTAL.
FORGET HOSPITALS.
I CAN GO TO ANYBODY WHO PROVIDES
ANY TYPE OF HEALTH SERVICE
AND SAY, SIGN UP THERE,
"PLEASE CLEAN YOUR PHONE.
PUT IT IN HERE," SLAM IT,
ONE MINUTE, BOOM, AND I'M --
WESLEY AND DAN, I THINK MARK
IS EXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC.
I THINK
TEACHING ANY ADMINISTRATION
TO START A NEW HABIT, ASK
THE VISITOR TO PUT THE PHONE IN,
I THINK YOU'RE DREAMING.
HERE'S MY OBJECTION TO IT.
AS A SANITIZER,
IT'S EASY TO USE A BABY WIPE.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
BABY WIPE -- DONE.
THROW IT AWAY.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S NOT PORTABLE.
I THINK EVERYBODY TRAVELS
WITH THEIR CHARGER TODAY.
THIS IS TOO BULKY
TO TRAVEL WITH.
RIGHT.
AND SO, FOR ALL OF THOSE
REASONS, I'M OUT.
O'Leary:
I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN PROVEN
YET AS A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET
IS REALLY ANAL ENOUGH
TO BUY THIS
AND WHAT THE CUSTOMER-
ACQUISITION COST IS GONNA BE.
THE ONLY WAY I DO THIS DEAL --
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU THIS OFFER --
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $300,000.
I WANT $6 A UNIT
UNTIL I RECOUP THE $300,000.
AFTER THAT, IT DROPS TO $3 UNTIL
I GET PAID OUT $1.2 MILLION,
AND THEN I GO AWAY.
IT'S -- IT'S A PURE
VENTURE-DEBT STRATEGY.
I THINK IT'S FAIR.
IT'S SOMETHING.
LET'S SEE IF
YOU YOU CAN DO ANY BETTER.
Cuban: IT'S SOMETHING.
IT'S STILL A RIP-OFF.
WE --
I -- I APPREC--
WELL, APPARENTLY,
THAT'S COMING
FROM SOMEONE
WHO GAVE YOU THIS. ZERO.
Corcoran: YEAH.
I WOULDN'T INSULT YOU
WITH THAT.
LOTS OF ADVICE
THAT'S WORTHLESS.
BY THE WAY, I THINK THE
HOSPITAL MARKET IS INTERESTING,
BUT THE SALES CYCLE IS YEARS,
NOT MONTHS -- YEARS.
WE APPRECIATE THAT OFFER.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
IS SOMEONE TO COME IN
FOR AN EQUITY STAKE
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SELLING IT.
THE MARKET
HAS BEEN RESPONDING.
60% OF OUR SALES ARE ONLINE
THROUGH TARGETED MARKETING,
SO PEOPLE
ARE BUYING THIS.
THEY DO LIKE
THIS CONCEPT.
TO ME, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BUY.
BUT ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE,
THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.
ANY MEDICAL FACILITY,
PARTICULARLY IN A WAITING ROOM,
WHERE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S
USING THEIR PHONES TO KILL TIME.
BUT FROM A HEALTHCARE
PROFESSIONAL'S PERSPECTIVE,
I COULD CARRY ANYTHING BAD
INTO THAT WAITING ROOM,
WHICH COULD THEN BE PICKED UP
AND DISTRIBUTED
THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL,
WAITING ROOM, WHATEVER.
THAT'S ENORMOUS VALUE.
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE UP YOUR PHONE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.
I MADE YOU AN OFFER.
SHOULD I WITHDRAW IT?
UM, WE THINK THAT THE --
THE COMPANY IS, UM,
IS WORTH
WHAT WE ASKED FOR.
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?
I'M OUT.
WOW. BIRD IN THE HAND.
OKAY, I'LL MAKE YOU GUYS
AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $300,000.
YOU'RE A FOOL.
I'M ALWAYS A FOOL,
BUT IT'S MADE ME A LOT OF MONEY.
20%, AND THE CONTINGENCY IS
THAT YOU CAN DELIVER A UNIT
THAT CHARGES IN 30 SECONDS
AND THAT WE CAN PRICE
IN THE AREA OF THE $12 COST.
ALL RIGHT, WES, DAN,
YOU'VE GOT AN OFFER -- $300,000.
YOU HAVE HIS OFFER,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MINE.
