HI. I'M DAN BARNES.
NO, DAN, YOU USE
PHONESOAP CHARGER.
PHONESOAP CHARGER
USES ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT
TO KILL ALL THE BACTERIA ON
YOUR PHONE IN JUST FIVE MINUTES.
AMEN, DANIEL.
[ HERJAVEC LAUGHS ]
DO WE GET TO SEE SAMPLES?
I'LL BRING ONE RIGHT UP.
WHY WOULDN'T
I JUST USE SANITIZER?
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
THANK YOU.
SO, ALCOHOL, OBVIOUSLY,
KILLS BACTERIA,
BUT IT REALLY DOES
TWO THINGS.
Barnes:
IT WAS FROM A LOCAL INVESTOR.
WE GAVE UP
60% OF OUR COMPANY.
60%?
SO, THE QUESTION
IS WHY?
YES.
WE WERE
TWO ENTREPRENEURS
THAT REALLY HAD AN IDEA
THAT WE LOVED.
WE HIT THE POINT
WHERE IT WAS LIKE,
"IT'S GONNA COST US
A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE IT,"
ALL RIGHT, WES, DAN,
YOU'VE GOT AN OFFER -- $300,000.
YOU HAVE HIS OFFER,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MINE.
