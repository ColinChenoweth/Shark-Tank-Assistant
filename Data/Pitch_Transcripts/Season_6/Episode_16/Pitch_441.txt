[ French accent ]
<i>BONJOUR.</i> I'M DEBORAH MENIANE.
[ French accent ]
AND I'M DAVID MENIANE.
AND WE LIVE
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.
AND WE'RE THE OWNERS
OF VICTORIA'S KITCHEN.
DAVID AND I GREW UP TOGETHER
IN PARIS.
OUR PARENTS
WERE BEST FRIENDS.
WE WENT TO
THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL.
EVEN THOUGH
WE STARTED AS FRIENDS,
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN, DEEP DOWN,
THAT WE WOULD END UP TOGETHER.
WE'RE MADE
FOR EACH OTHER.
SHE'S COOKING IN THIS ONE.
SHE'S PROBABLY MAKING IT.
MY GRANDMOTHER VICTORIA
USED TO MAKE OUR PRODUCT
IN HER KITCHEN,
AND EVERY SUNDAY,
WE WOULD GO TO HER HOUSE
AND CONSUME IT.
WE MADE OUR PRODUCT FOR
OUR FRIENDS WHEN THEY CAME OVER.
THEY LOVED IT SO MUCH,
THEY KEPT ASKING US TO MAKE MORE
FOR THEM TO TAKE HOME.
AND, <i>VOILà,</i>
OUR PRODUCT WAS BORN,
AND WE OWE IT ALL
TO GRANDMA.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
David: IN THE FOOD-AND-BEVERAGE
INDUSTRY,
THE COMPETITORS
ARE REALLY BIG.
AND BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES
THE BIG PLAYERS HAVE,
WE HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE
TO MAKE IT WORK.
WE RISKED EVERYTHING
FOR THE BUSINESS.
WE INVESTED
ALL OUR LIFE SAVINGS,
AND WE BOTH QUIT OUR JOBS.
IT'S MY GRANDMOTHER'S NAME,
IT'S MY GRANDMOTHER'S FACE,
IT'S OUR ENTIRE LIVES,
SO I REALLY NEED IT TO SUCCEED.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DAVID,
AND THIS IS MY WIFE, DEBORAH.
WE'RE FROM PARIS, FRANCE,
AND WE'RE THE FOUNDERS
OF VICTORIA'S KITCHEN.
TODAY WE'RE SEEKING
AN INVESTMENT OF $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
SO, I'M SURE MANY OF YOU
GREW UP WITH A GRANDMOTHER
WHO LIKED TO COOK,
RIGHT?
AND MY GRANDMOTHER VICTORIA
IS NO EXCEPTION.
BUT UNLIKE
AMERICAN GRANDMOTHERS
WHO LIKE TO MAKE LEMONADE
OR SWEET ICED TEA,
SHE MAKES
AN AMAZING ALMOND WATER.
IT'S LIGHT, IT'S CRISP,
AND IT'S SO REFRESHING.
SO, WHEN DAVID AND I
MOVED TO THE U.S.,
WE PACKED THIS ONE-OF-A-KIND
FRENCH RECIPE WITH US.
WE STARTED MAKING IT,
AND OUR FRIENDS
COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT.
WE HAD ALWAYS WANTED
TO START A BUSINESS TOGETHER,
SO ONE DAY, WE LOOKED
AT EACH OTHER AND WE SAID...
"WHY NOT ALMOND WATER?"
[ LAUGHS ]
OUR ALMOND WATER
IS ALL-NATURAL,
VEGAN, SOY-FREE, DAIRY-FREE,
GMO-FREE, GLUTEN-FREE,
BUT MOST OF ALL,
IT IS THAT PERFECT TREAT
THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE LOUNGING
IN THE FRESHLY CUT GRASS
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.
SO, WHO'S READY
TO STEP INTO...
Both:
VICTORIA'S KITCHEN...
...AND JOIN OUR FAMILY?
CAN WE TRY IT?
OF COURSE.
HOW MANY CALORIES
PER BOTTLE?
SO, THE ORIGINAL HAS
110 CALORIES PER BOTTLE.
THAT'S IT?
THE COCONUT HAS
100 CALORIES PER BOTTLE.
SO, WE HAVE TWO FLAVORS.
ALMOND WATER ORIGINAL
IS THE COMBINATION
OF ALMOND, VANILLA,
AND ROSE.
AND THEN WE HAVE
ALMOND AND COCONUT.
[ CORCORAN LAUGHS ]
YEAH.
DAVID, IT'S FANTASTIC.
SERIOUSLY.
THANK YOU.
IT'S VERY SWEET.
SO, IT'S BASED ON
MY GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE.
THAT'S YOUR GRANDMOTHER
IN THE PICTURE?
THAT'S VICTORIA. SHE'S
ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH US.
YES. [ CHUCKLES ]
DAVID, TELL ME
ABOUT ALMOND WATER.
IS THIS A COMMON DRINK
IN FRANCE?
SO, IT'S VERY POPULAR
IN EUROPE --
IN ITALY, IN SICILY,
IN GREECE, IN TURKEY...
SEE IF YOU WANT
THIS ONE.
...IN MIDDLE EASTERN
COUNTRIES.
WAS IT A SPECIALTY DRINK,
LIKE A DESSERT THING?
IT'S A FAMILY DRINK.
IT'S A PICNIC DRINK.
YOU KNOW,
I GO TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S,
SHE MAKES APPLE CAKE
AND ALMOND WATER.
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
WE HAVE IN THE SHARK TANK
WITH ALL OF THE BEVERAGE DEALS
THAT COMES IN HERE,
IN THE END, DISTRIBUTION SEEMS
TO BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE --
GETTING SHELF SPACE AWAY
FROM GIANT COMPANIES WHO OWN IT.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THERE?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
FIRST YEAR --
$160,000.
OKAY.
SECOND YEAR --
$330,000.
AND THIR--
AND WE'RE
IN OUR THIRD YEAR.
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE AT ABOUT $210,000,
$220,000
FOR 8 MONTHS.
AND, DAVID, HOW ARE SELLING IT?
WHAT STORES?
SO, WE SELL MOSTLY TO NATURAL
AND SPECIALTY FOOD STORES
AND INDEPENDENT GROCERY STORES
FOR 60 CENTS,
AND THEN I SELL IT FOR $1.10.
IT'S 45% MARGIN.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
IN AMERICA?
14 YEARS? YEAH.
14 YEARS, YES.
SO, I MOVED OUT HERE,
I WAS 17 YEARS OLD,
DIDN'T SPEAK
A WORD OF ENGLISH,
AND MY DREAM WAS,
"LET ME CREATE SOMETHING.
LET ME START SOME--
SOMETHING FROM SCRATCH."
SO, I HAD
A HIGH-PAYING JOB BEFORE,
AND I LEFT
TO DO THIS FULL TIME.
WE WANTED TO BUILD A BUSINESS,
SO WE TOOK ALL OUR SAVINGS
AND WE INVESTED IT
IN VICTORIA'S KITCHEN.
HOW MUCH?
ABOUT $250,000...
WOW.
...WHICH IS EVERYTHING
WE HAD, SO --
THAT'S ALL IN.
THAT'S ALL IN.
ALL IN. IT'S ALL IN.
IT'S ALL IN. YEAH.
LOOK -- LOOK,
I JUST -- I WANT TO GO BACK --
HOW MANY STORES ARE YOU IN?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
ABOUT 800?
ABOUT 800.
NATIONWIDE. YEAH.
NAME A COUPLE?
DO YOU HAVE WHOLE FOODS?
WHOLE FOOD,
NEW SEASONS...
OH, YOU DO?
...ANDRONICO'S, LUNARDI'S.
WHOLE FOODS IS NOT REALLY
OUR TARGET MARKET.
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
IT SEEMS PERFECT.
I WOULD THINK
IT'S PERFECT.
BECAUSE --
IT'S -- IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT THAT PERFECT
BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY --
IT'S A MARKET THAT'S
REALLY TARGETED ON HEALTH --
MEANING, IT'S NOT --
BECAUSE IT HAS
15 GRAMS OF SUGAR.
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS FUNCTIONAL.
IT DOESN'T HAVE
A VITAMIN.
IT'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOU GROW
WINGS OR, YOU KNOW, RUN FASTER.
WELL, NO. NO, BUT COME ON.
NO, NO, REALLY, IT COMES DOWN
TO THE SUGAR, RIGHT?
HOW MANY GRAMS OF SUGAR
IS IN A SODA,
AS OPPOSED TO ONE OF THESE?
IT COULD GO DOUBLE.
I'LL GIVE YOU --
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
UM, THE TOP-SELLING LEMONADE
IN THE UNITED STATES,
THERE IS 56 GRAMS OF SUGAR
IN 16 OUNCES.
YEAH, BUT BETTER -- BETTER
THAN BAD DOESN'T MAKE IT GOOD.
NO, BUT IT'S JUST --
IT'S DIFFERENT.
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
THERE'S A FEW WAYS
WE CAN GROW THE COMPANY.
ONE WAY
IS ADDING MORE SKUs.
SECOND --
MEANING, ADDING --
ADDING MORE FLAVORS
AND MORE PRODUCTS.
HOW ABOUT MORE STORES?
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEFORE GETTING TO MORE STORES,
I WANT TO SELL MORE PRODUCT
TO MY EXISTING STORES.
I WANT TO FOCUS
ON THE MARKETS THAT I HAVE.
SO, WHAT'S THE NEXT FLAVOR?
WHY DON'T WE SHOW YOU OUR NEW --
OUR NEXT PRODUCT.
PERFECT!
YES! DO THAT.
ALL RIGHT, SO, THIS --
THESE ARE SAMPLES.
WE WANTED
TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.
WE HAVE DISTRIBUTORS.
WE HAVE RETAILERS THAT LIKE US.
DAVID, TELL ME WHAT THIS IS.
Corcoran:
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THIS IS AN ORGANIC,
LOW-CALORIE LEMONADE...
OH, LOW-CALORIE!
SHOCKING!
...WITH
COLD-PRESSED GINGER.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
WE HAVE
ORGANIC LEMON JUICE,
ORGANIC, COLD-PRESSED
GINGER JUICE,
AND THEN
CAYENNE PEPPER.
Deborah:
BUT IT'S MADE WITH AGAVE.
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME
IS YOU WENT LOWER-CALORIE,
SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE
YOU TOOK --
IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE YOU TOOK ADVICE.
YES. WE LISTEN TO
WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY.
MM.
I'M NOT GONNA TELL THEM
WHAT THEY LIKE.
Corcoran:
YOU GAVE US FIGURES EARLIER.
YOU SAID YEAR 1,
YOU DID $160,000.
YEAR 2, YOU DID $330,000.
SO FAR THIS YEAR, $210,000.
IF I MULTIPLY THAT OUT,
THAT MEANS YOUR SALES --
YOU'LL END THE YEAR
WITH ROUGHLY $280,000,
AS OPPOSED TO $330,000
LAST YEAR.
ARE SALES DOWN?
WHY HAVE YOUR SALES
GONE DOWN SO MUCH?
SO, WE HAD A THIRD SKU,
SO WE HAD AN ALMOND WATER
WITH LICORICE-MINT.
IT WAS OUR FAVORITE SKU --
MY FAVORITE SKU.
NOT HERE, RIGHT?
NOW, WE DISCONTINUED IT.
SO, WE SOLD ABOUT $40,000
OF THAT LAST YEAR,
SO I DON'T HAVE THAT
THIS YEAR.
SO YOUR SALES DROPPED BY $40,000
BECAUSE OF THAT ONE PRODUCT?
YEAH, THAT ONE SKU.
OKAY.
RIGHT NOW,
WE SELL ABOUT $25,000 --
$25,000 TO $30,000
A MONTH.
THAT'S WITH NO SALES FORCE,
NO MERCHANDISING.
LISTEN,
I LIKE YOUR PACKAGING.
I THINK IT'S PRETTY.
IT TASTES DELICIOUS.
BUT I FEEL YOU DO HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO --
TO DO IN CHANGING
THIS PRODUCT
SO THAT IT WILL BECOME
A BETTER FIT
FOR PLACES LIKE WHOLE FOODS --
I THINK YOU'LL GET THERE --
BUT FOR THAT REASON,
RIGHT NOW, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT SPECIFIC PRODUCT,
BUT YOU LIKE ME,
YOU LIKE MY WIFE,
YOU LIKE MY PACKAGING,
YOU PARTNER UP WITH US,
AND I'LL LISTEN
TO FEEDBACK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'VE PROVEN THE FACT
THAT I CAN LISTEN.
DAVID, I INVESTED IN A
SODA COMPANY CALLED CHILL SODA.
I WALKED THE ROAD OVER TWO YEARS
OF HOW HARD IT IS
TO GET THE SPACE
IN THE GROCERY STORE
TO MAKE THIS BRAND HAPPEN.
I DON'T THINK THE AMOUNT
YOU'RE ASKING, $200,000,
IS ANYTHING THAT'S GONNA
APPROACH WHAT YOU NEED.
SO I'M OUT.
DAVID, YOUR DRIVE IS --
IS TANGIBLE.
IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW MOTIVATED
BOTH OF YOU ARE.
AND, UH...HERE'S THE PART
I DON'T LIKE.
YOU ALMOST LISTEN <i>TOO</i> MUCH.
YOU -- YOU --
WHEN YOU'RE THIS SMALL,
YOU CAN'T ASSUME YOUR CUSTOMERS
KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.
SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU'RE STARTING
A BRAND-NEW MARKET,
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE CUSTOMERS
WHAT THEY WANT.
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN TO
THE CUSTOMERS ALL THE TIME.
I THINK YOU'RE --
WE LISTEN FOR TWEAKS.
I'M NOT GONNA TELL THEM, "I WANT
THIS PRODUCT," AND MAKE IT.
BUT IF PEOPLE TELL ME
IT'S A LITTLE TOO SWEET,
THEN I'M GONNA
CUT THE SUGAR BY 20%.
OR IF WE HEAR A LOT THAT,
YOU KNOW, SUGAR --
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ROBERT?
SO WE LAUNCHED
OUR ALMOND WATER COCONUT.
[ Normal voice ]
UH...I'M OUT.
O'Leary: NORMALLY,
WHAT I WOULD DO IS --
IS EVISCERATE YOU ON VALUATION,
BUT BECAUSE I'M A NICE GUY,
I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER,
BUT YOUR ASK IS RIDICULOUS.
UM, YOU'RE NOT WORTH
A MILLION BUCKS.
I WANT TO PARTNER
WITH YOU.
IF YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE TOO HIGH,
YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED
TO MAKE IT WORK,
AND MAYBE
WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.
I-I -- MY -- MY MOST VALUABLE
RESOURCE IS MY TIME.
I'D HAVE TO SPEND
A LOT OF TIME WITH YOU,
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
I'M OUT.
MARK, I-I KNOW
WE'RE SMALL...
[ CHUCKLES ]
...AND I KNOW, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE MADE MISTAKES,
BUT WE'RE GROWING.
WE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT.
IF IT HAS SUGAR
AND IT'S A PROBLEM FOR YOU,
WE CAN MAKE A KIDS' LINE,
YOU KNOW?
YEAH, B-- THE PROBLEM IS --
I'LL TELL YOU --
BUT IT'S SELLING.
PEOPLE LIKE IT.
I-I GET THAT, HONESTLY,
BUT YOU'RE STARTING TO COME
ACROSS AS DESPERATE, RIGHT?
SERIOUSLY.
NO, I-I --
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING AGGRESSIVE...
YEAH?
...AND A GREAT SALESPERSON
AND THEN SAYING YES
TO EVERY QUESTION
THAT A POTENTIAL INVESTOR ASKS.
I'M NOT -- I HAVEN'T SAID YES
TO ANYTHING YET.
YES, YOU HAVE.
YES, YOU'VE SAID
TO EVERYTHING, YOU'VE SAID YES.
YOU'VE SAID YES
TO EVERYTHING.
[ French accent ]
"YOU DON'T LIKE THE SUGAR,
WE PUT IN THE SUGAR.
YOU DON'T LIKE THE PACKAGING,
WE CHANGE THE PACKAGING."
Greiner:
"WE CAN MAKE IT WORK."
[ LAUGHS ]
NO, I'M NOT GONNA
CUT THE SUGAR COMPLETELY,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE TOO SWEET --
[ Normal voice ]
YEAH, THERE YOU GO!
I -- CAN SELL.
I CAN --
IF YOU'RE PART
OF THE COMPANY,
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO
YOUR INPUT, TOO.
YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY.
NO, YOU CAN'T
PLEASE EVERYBODY.
GUYS...IF YOU HAD WALKED IN HERE
WITH A ZERO-CALORIE,
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALL OVER IT.
I'M OUT.
OH, DAVID, DEBORAH, <i>MERCI.</i>
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, SHARKS.
<i>MERCI BEAUCOUP.</i>
<i>MERCI. MERCI BEAUCOUP.</i>
HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT.
EH?
IT'S OKAY.
WE CAME TO AMERICA, WE DIDN'T
SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH.
WE BUILT A BUSINESS
FROM SCRATCH.
WE WENT INTO THE SHARK TANK,
AND WE GOT
SOME GREAT POSITIVE FEEDBACK
FROM ALL THE SHARKS.
THAT'S AMAZING FOR US.
THAT'S AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
AND EVEN THOUGH
WE DIDN'T GET A DEAL,
IT'S STILL
VERY ENCOURAGING.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A BETTER, GREENER DESIGN
OF A TO-GO ACCESSORY.
HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M JEN.
