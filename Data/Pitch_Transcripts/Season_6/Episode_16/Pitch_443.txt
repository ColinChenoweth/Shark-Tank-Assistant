MY NAME IS AARON McDANIEL,
FROM SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,
AND I'M THE C.E.O.
OF TYCOON REAL ESTATE.
I'M SEEKING $50,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 5% OF MY COMPANY.
FOR LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF YEARS,
THE MOST PROVEN WAY
TO CONSISTENTLY BUILD WEALTH
HAS BEEN THROUGH INVESTING
IN REAL ESTATE.
UNFORTUNATELY, TRADITIONAL
REAL-ESTATE INVESTING
IS DIFFICULT, INTIMIDATING,
AND EXPENSIVE.
THE BEST DEALS ARE ONLY OFFERED
TO THE SUPERWEALTHY
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,
HELPING THE RICH GET RICHER
AND LOCKING
THE REST OF US OUT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
[ LAUGHS ]
NOW YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GET IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR
OF AN EXCITING, NEW BUSINESS
THAT WILL CHANGE
REAL-ESTATE INVESTING FOREVER.
TYCOON REAL ESTATE
IS A CROWD-INVESTING PLATFORM
THAT ALLOWS EVERYDAY PEOPLE
TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE
FOR AS LITTLE AS $1,000.
I HATE IT. I'M OUT.
Corcoran: WOW.
I SMELL JAIL TIME.
WOW, MARK.
THAT'S AGGRESSIVE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BARBARA?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I HAVEN'T EVEN FORMED
AN OPINION. KEEP GOING.
SURE, YEAH. LET ME --
LET ME GO AHEAD AND FINISH MY --
DON'T LET THAT
UNSETTLE YOU.
SO, ALL OF OUR DEALS
ARE PROFESSIONALLY VETTED,
ONLY WORKING
WITH TOP DEVELOPERS.
AND IF THE FUNDING GOAL IS NOT
MET FOR A CERTAIN PROJECT,
EVERYONE
GETS THEIR MONEY BACK.
SO NOW YOU CAN GET 8 TO 10 TIMES
THE RETURN YOU COULD GET,
COMPARED TO KEEPING YOUR MONEY
IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.
SO, LET ME --
LET ME TALK YOU THROUGH
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HOW IT WORKS.
SO, FIRST,
WE GO TO TYCOON'S WEBSITE.
ONCE YOU'RE HERE,
YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH
OUR LIST
OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.
THERE ARE A VARIETY
OF DIFFERENT TYPES
FROM RESIDENTIAL TO COMMERCIAL,
EACH WITH THEIR OWN
UNIQUE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.
SO, AS AN EXAMPLE, THIS ONE HERE
IS A MARQUEE RETAIL PROPERTY
THAT'S PART OF A LARGE
COMMERCIAL COMPLEX
JUST OUTSIDE
OF THE MANHATTAN AREA.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ENTER THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU'D LIKE TO INVEST,
GO THROUGH
A SIMPLE ONLINE PROCESS,
AND ONCE
THE INVESTMENT GOAL IS MET,
YOU'RE A REAL-ESTATE INVESTOR.
THEN YOU CAN SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE PROFITS YOU GET
FROM THE APPRECIATION AND
THE CASH FLOWS OF THE PROPERTY.
SO, SHARKS, WE'RE ON THE BRINK
OF AN EXCITING, NEW ERA
WHERE LITERALLY ANYONE
CAN BE A REAL-ESTATE TYCOON.
HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
HOW DO I GET THE RETURN?
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!
GIVE THE GUY A CIGAR!
SO, I MEAN, ULTIMATELY,
THIS IS --
THIS IS A BUSINESS TO SCALE
IN A BIG WAY.
BUT WALK ME THROUGH
A SINGLE MODEL.
SURE.
I INVEST IN THAT BUILDING
IN NEW JERSEY.
I GIVE YOU $10,000.
SURE.
I ASSUME I OWN
SOME PERCENTAGE OF IT.
THAT'S CORRECT.
I ASSUME THAT BUILDING
IS TAKING ON SO MUCH RENT,
I'M MAKING MONEY.
YES.
THEN THE BUILDING
GETS SOLD ONE DAY.
MM-HMM.
I'M ASSUMING I MAKE A RETURN
ON MY $10,000
EQUAL TO MY VALUE
OF THE OVERALL BUILDING.
RIGHT, SO DEPENDING ON --
WHO SETS THE VALUE
OF THE BUILDING
AT THE TIME
THAT I INVEST?
THE -- WHAT WE REFER TO
AS THE DEAL MAKER --
THE DEVELOPER WHO IS LOOKING
TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE PROJECT.
SO, THERE IS
A LEAD DEVELOPER
THAT IS IN CHARGE
OF THE INVESTMENT?
THAT'S CORRECT.
ARE YOU TAKING A FEE?
SO, WHAT WE TAKE
IS A MANAGEMENT FEE,
A TECHNOLOGY FEE,
SERVICE FEE.
HOW MUCH IS THAT?
HOW ABOUT -- WHAT'S --
1.25%
OF THE AMOUNT RAISED.
HOW MANY
EXISTING BUILDINGS
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY FUNDED
THIS WAY?
ANSWER BARB'S QUESTION.
YEAH, I'M SORRY, BARBARA.
'CAUSE SHE IS
THE REAL-ESTATE MAVEN.
WE'VE DONE
TWO PROOF-OF-CONCEPT DEALS.
FIRST,
WAS A TOTALLY CLOSED DEAL.
AND WHAT WAS THE TOTAL RAISED
ON THAT DEAL?
THAT WAS $100,000.
WHAT WAS IT,
A GARAGE SPACE?
IT WAS A -- IT WAS A --
IT WAS A -- IT WAS A PART
OF A HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
IT WAS --
IT WAS A PORTION OF THE --
OF THE DEBT POSITION
IN A HOUSE.
AND YOU CHARGED 1.25%
FOR THAT DEAL?
UH, YES.
LET'S SAY I WANT TO INVEST
IN REAL ESTATE.
I CAN GO ONLINE
TO ONE OF THE BIG PLAYERS --
FIDELITY OR SCHWAB --
I CAN BUY A REIT.
A REIT IS A REAL-ESTATE
INVESTMENT TRUST...
MM-HMM.
...SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET
DIVERSIFICATION IN REAL ESTATE.
TOTAL LIQUIDITY.
I CAN BUY AND SELL IT
ANY DAY I WANT.
I'M GONNA
GET MY YIELD OF 4.5%.
MM-HMM.
AND I HAVE 5,000 PROPERTIES
INSIDE THE REITs.
REITs AREN'T SEXY.
NOBODY BRAGS ABOUT REITs.
THAT'S SO HORRIBLE.
THAT IS SO HORRIBLE.
Herjavec: BUT, AARON,
WHO CARES ABOUT SEXY
WHEN IT COMES
TO SAVING MONEY?
THAT IS SO HORRIBLE.
BECAU--
BECAUSE YOU TALK TO ANY --
THAT IS WRONG
IN SO MANY WAYS.
YOU TALK TO
ANY REAL-ESTATE INVESTOR,
AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS
THEY TALK ABOUT INVESTING
IS THAT PHYSICAL,
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
THEY HAVE TO THE BUILDING.
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A PHYSICAL
AND EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
TO THEIR LIFE SAVINGS.
I LOVE INVESTING
IN REAL ESTATE,
BUT I RECOGNIZE
IT'S PURE LUCK.
I-I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S TRUE.
IF YOU CAN BUY
ALMOST ANY PIECE OF REAL ESTATE,
YOU WILL MAKE MONEY
OVER 10 YEARS.
MM-HMM.
IF, DURING THAT TIME,
YOU NEED LIQUIDITY,
YOU MAY LOSE
A LOT OF MONEY.
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH
PEOPLE'S LIFE SAVINGS --
MM-HMM.
...AND I THINK THIS ATTRACTS
THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO WANTS A GREATER RETURN
FOR THEIR RETIREMENT --
I THINK YOU GOT TO BE
CONSERVATIVE WITH YOUR MONEY.
BE RISKY AT WORK,
BE SAFE WITH YOUR INVESTMENTS.
A-AND TO THAT POINT,
T-THERE -- THERE'S AN --
I'M OUT. I'M OUT.
OKAY.
AND T-THERE -- AND THERE --
THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENTS
YOU CAN ALSO GO FOR.
THIS IS NOT
A CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENT.
PLATFORMS LIKE THIS CAN ACTUALLY
HELP STANDARDIZE THINGS,
PROTECT INVESTORS SO THAT
THEY CAN FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE.
PROTECT INVESTORS?
THAT'S -- THAT'S --
THAT'S CORRECT.
THE REASON I WENT OUT --
AND THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM
WITH A LOT OF
CROWDFUNDING-BASED INVESTMENTS,
NOT JUST REAL ESTATE,
RIGHT?
SURE.
WHEN GRANDMA
HEARS ABOUT CROWDFUNDING
AND HOW ALL THESE NEW
OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOW AVAILABLE
TO NORMAL AMERICANS WHO WANT
TO TOUCH AND FEEL REAL ESTATE,
THEY PUT THEIR LAST $1,000 IN,
THEIR FIRST $1,000 --
DOESN'T MATTER
HOW MUCH THEY HAVE LEFT.
YEAH.
BUT SOMEBODY GETS SICK.
GRANDMA GETS SICK.
YOU KNOW, CAR BREAKS DOWN,
WHATEVER IT IS.
THEY NEED LIQUIDITY.
YES.
THEY HAVE NONE.
GOT TO DECIDE, AARON.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
NO, SO...
HE'S SAYING NO.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
I FORGOT YOUR NAME ALREADY.
I'M OUT.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
THANK YOU.
THE SHARKS DIDN'T GET IT
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
TYCOON REAL ESTATE
IS NOT A SLEAZY COMPANY
LOOKING TO SWINDLE MONEY
OUT OF ANYONE.
WE'RE LOOKING TO HELP PEOPLE
INVEST IN REAL ESTATE
AND GIVE THEM A NEW OPPORTUNITY
THAT THEY NEVER
COULD HAVE HAD BEFORE.
ROBERT, AFTER SIX YEARS
IN THE SHARK TANK WITH YOU,
I'M VERY TOUCHED.
YOU SAID SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT ME,
AND YOU REALLY DISCOVERED
WHO I AM.
[ LAUGHS ]
I REALLY <i>DO</i> LOVE MY MONEY.
AND NEXT TIME YOU GET IN A BOAT
WITH A RAT AND SOME RICE,
I'LL JOIN YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I NEARLY TEARED UP.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A PRODUCT
