MY NAME IS ANDREW FELD.
I LIVE IN DAVENPORT, FLORIDA,
WITH MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE, CORRINA,
MY DAUGHTER, CLAUDIA,
AND OUR DOG, CHLOE,
AND I AM THE OWNER
OF FRESH PATCH.
CORRINA AND I GOT MARRIED
THREE MONTHS
AFTER MEETING EACH OTHER,
AND THEN CORRINA GOT OFFERED
A JOB IN FLORIDA,
SO WE DECIDED
THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY
TO START SOMETHING NEW.
WE MOVED FROM A HOUSE
WITH A BACKYARD
INTO A CONDO
WITH A SMALL BALCONY.
IT WAS REALLY HARD
ON MY DOG, CHLOE.
I DIDN'T HAVE A JOB.
I WAS APPLYING FOR JOBS,
AND NOTHING WAS HAPPENING.
AND THEN I FOUND OUT
MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I KNEW I NEEDED TO STEP UP
AND FIND A WAY
TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY.
I CAME UP WITH AN INVENTION
FOR CHLOE
THAT SHE TOOK TO REALLY WELL,
SO I DECIDED TO TURN THAT IDEA
INTO A BUSINESS.
FINANCIALLY, I'M ALL IN.
I NEED THE SHARKS' EXPERTISE
AS MUCH AS THEIR CAPITAL
IF I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF.
MY FAMILY'S FUTURE
DEPENDS ON THIS BUSINESS,
SO IF I DON'T GET A DEAL --
WELL, THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

HI.
MY NAME IS ANDREW FELD.
I LIVE IN DAVENPORT, FLORIDA,
AND I'M THE FOUNDER
OF FRESH PATCH.
I'M SEEKING $150,000
FOR A 10% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
FRESH PATCH
IS A REAL-GRASS DELIVERY SERVICE
FOR THE MILLION PETS
WHO HAVE EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THEIR OWN BACKYARD.
FOUR YEARS AGO,
MY WIFE AND I AND MY DOG, CHLOE,
MOVED FROM A HOUSE
WITH A BACKYARD INTO A CONDO.
NOW, FOR A DOG,
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN NOT HAVING
YOUR OWN BACKYARD.
I WAS BUSY BUILDING
AND MAINTAINING
A MINI-BACKYARD ON MY BALCONY.
MY WIFE THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY,
BUT MY DOG DIDN'T.
[ LAUGHS ]
MY DOG ABSOLUTELY LOVED
THAT GRASSY AREA I HAD CREATED.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE GRASS
WOULD EVENTUALLY DIE OFF,
AND MAINTAINING IT
BECAME A CHORE.
AND THAT IS WHERE THE IDEA
FOR FRESH PATCH WAS BORN.
WE ARE THE FIRST REAL-GRASS
DELIVERY SERVICE OF ITS KIND,
SHIPPING OUR BOXES
OF HYDROPONICALLY GROWN GRASS
TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
THERE'S NO CLEANING.
THERE'S NO MESS.
WHEN A NEW FRESH PATCH
ARRIVES ON YOUR DOORSTEP,
YOU SIMPLY THROW
THE OLD ONE AWAY.
WE'RE A HIT
WITH ALL KINDS OF CUSTOMERS
WHO USE IT WITH
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF PETS.
IT'S EASY, IT'S CONVENIENT,
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
THE ANIMALS LOVE IT.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S INTERESTED
IN TURNING
SOME OF THIS GREEN GRASS
INTO GREEN CASH?
ANDREW,
YOU HAD IT ON YOUR BALCONY.
I DID.
WHAT IF I BRING IT
INTO MY APARTMENT,
IN AN ENCLOSED
ENVIRONMENT?
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
BEFORE IT HAS AN ODOR?
IT'S A LIVING PLANT,
SO IT NATURALLY
BREAKS DOWN ODORS.
IT DOESN'T SMELL.
Greiner:
THERE ARE, LIKE,
LITTLE PAPER THINGS
THAT YOU CAN LAY DOWN...
BUT DOGS
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, RIGHT?
...THAT SMALL DOGS
ARE TRAINED TO GO ON.
RIGHT. PEE PADS. AND EVERYONE
KNOWS WHAT PEE PADS --
PEE PADS.
BUT NO ONE LIKES PEE PADS.
PETS DON'T LIKE PEE PADS.
DOGS DON'T LIKE PEE PADS.
THEY TEAR THEM UP.
THEY'RE CONFUSING TO USE.
THIS IS INSTINCTIVE
TO DOGS.
THERE'S NO TRAINING
INVOLVED.
WHAT IF I HAVE
A REALLY BIG DOG?
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE FRESH PATCH XL.
THIS IS
THE FRESH PATCH XL.
THIS IS FOR
A LARGER-SIZED DOG.
OH, I SEE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
I'VE SOLD OVER A MILLION DOLLARS
WORTH OF THIS TO DATE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
GOOD FOR YOU. GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT'S AWESOME.
ANDREW,
THAT'S AMAZING.
IS THAT ALL ONLINE SALES,
OR DO YOU SELL IN ANY OTHER WAY?
IT'S ALL ONLINE.
WE'RE DIRECT TO THE CUSTOMER.
THAT'S EVEN BETTER.
SO, ANDREW,
YOU MUST HAVE
A RECURRING-REVENUE MODEL,
OBVIOUSLY.
YES, WE OFFER SEVERAL DIFFERENT
SUBSCRIPTION MODELS.
THE MOST COMMON ONE
IS EVERY OTHER WEEK.
WHAT DOES IT COST?
$25 PER DELIVERY.
HOW MANY RECURRING CUSTOMERS
DO YOU HAVE --
SUBSCRIBERS
DO YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW?
OKAY, ON-THE-BOOK SUBSCRIBERS --
LIKE 550.
OKAY.
O'Leary:
WHAT'S YOUR ATTRITION RATE?
HOW MANY PEOPLE TRY IT ONCE
AND NEVER USE IT AGAIN?
I WOULD SAY 25%
WILL STICK WITH IT.
ANDREW,
TWO OUT OF THREE CUSTOMERS
WHO ORDER FROM YOU
DON'T ORDER AGAIN?
CORRECT.
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
YEAH, THAT CONCERNED ME,
TOO, BARBARA.
SO, YOU'RE ONLY ONLINE
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU TO PUT
TOGETHER AND SHIP EVERYTHING?
THESE BOXES OF GRASS COME IN
JUST UNDER $5, INCLUDING LABOR.
THEN THE SHIPPING --
ON THE WEST COAST,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT $7 TO $8.
WHEN WE'RE SHIPPING THESE
TO NEW YORK,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT $14, $15.
AND THAT'S WHY YOU USE
A SHIP STATION IN ORDER TO --
WHO PAYS THE SHIPPING?
I DO.
SO, THAT'S WHAT'S KILLED
YOUR MARGINS.
'CAUSE IT COULD BE $19
ON A $25 SALE PRICE, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
AND WHO'S DOING
ALL THE TECHNOLOGY FOR YOU?
THAT'S ME. I CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA FOR THIS
THE DAY AFTER I FOUND OUT
MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT.
THAT'LL MAKE YOU
GO TO WORK.
IT'S CRAZY.
SO IT WAS LIKE
AN INSPIRATION FOR IT.
I LEARNED HOW TO BUILD
A WEBSITE.
ANDREW, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THE 75% ATTRITION RATE.
I WORRY THAT IT'S MORE
OF A NOVELTY RIGHT NOW.
BUT, MAN,
YOU'VE GOT SOME GREAT SALES.
I...
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T SEE
MY DOG USING IT.
I'D BE HAPPY
TO SEND YOU A FREE ONE
AND SEE
HOW HE TAKES TO IT.
SEND ME A NEW DOG.
IT'LL BE CHEAPER.
[ Laughing ] OKAY.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
SO, WHERE DO YOU HYDROPONICALLY
GROW YOUR GRASS PATCHES?
10% IS NOT A LOT.
10% IS NOT A LOT, ANDREW.
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR YOU
TO GIVE ANYONE A COUNTEROFFER.
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THE OFFERS.
THAT'S TRUE.
THANK YOU, BARBARA.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER --
$150,000 FOR 20%,
BUT THERE'S ONE CONTINGENCY.
YOU HAVE TO COMMIT TO BRINGING
THIS INTO THE PET SHOPS.
YOU WANT TO GO
TO RETAIL?
DEFINITELY.
I KNOW THE PET SPACE
INSIDE AND OUT
BECAUSE I BOUGHT A BUSINESS
NAMED RYAN'S BARKERY,
AND I HAD TO BUILD ALL THOSE
BRIDGES INTO THOSE STORES.
BUT I KNOW ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
I HAVE SUCH GREAT RELATIONSHIPS.
I THINK THEY WOULD CLEARLY
ORDER THIS PRODUCT AND SELL IT.
SO I'LL GIVE YOU
THE MONEY YOU'RE ASKING FOR,
BUT I MUST HAVE 20%,
AND YOU MUST COMMIT
TO BRINGING IT INTO RETAIL.
I'M GONNA DROP MY ASK ON EQUITY
DOWN TO 20%
AND REMOVE THAT COVENANT
REGARDING RETAIL.
'CAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME
THAT THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY.
IT'S PERISHABLE.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
DO YOU KNOW WHY EVERYBODY'S
GONNA BUY THIS IN A STORE?
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WHO HAS A PET
IN THE CITY FEELS GUILTY.
IF THEY COULD BRING
A NICE SLAB OF GREEN GRASS
HOME TO THE DOG
THEY'RE IGNORING
AND NOT EVER TAKING
TO THE PARK,
THEY'RE GONNA FEEL SO GOOD.
IT'S A FEEL-GOOD PRODUCT
MORE THAN IT IS
A PRODUCTIVE PRODUCT
FOR HELPING THE DOG.
CORRECT.
I KNOW THE HUGE VALUE
OF THIS,
AND I THINK YOU'RE JUST
AT THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
I REALLY AM.
'CAUSE GOING
INTO THE EAST COAST,
I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE
REALLY GONNA RAMP UP HUGE
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO
WALK THEIR DOGS IN THE WINTER.
I LIKE THAT YOU PRICED IT
AT A GOOD PRICE.
SO I'M THINKING
ABOUT THIS.
YOU CAME IN WANTING
$150,000 FOR 10%?
CORRECT.
I'M THINKING
FOR A MINUTE.
LORI STILL HASN'T
MADE AN OFFER, ANDREW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
WOULD YOU GUYS BE WILLING
TO WORK ON EQUITY?
I'LL TAKE THE OFFER.
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S A SMART MAN.
[ LAUGHS ]
Corcoran: GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
A LOT BIGGER.
IT'LL WORK OUT
REALLY WELL.
TERRIFIC.
YOU'RE SO SMART.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHOO-HOO!
