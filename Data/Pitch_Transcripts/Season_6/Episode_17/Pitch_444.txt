BARBARA CORCORAN WENT FROM

ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,

CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
THEY'RE SOURCED
FROM CALIFORNIA.
AND THE REASON
I'M HERE TODAY IS
TWO THIRDS OF THE MONEY
I'M ASKING FOR
IS GONNA GO
TOWARDS BUILDING OUT
OUR EAST COAST
DISTRIBUTION CENTER.
O'Leary: SO, ANDY,
NOW WE HAVE TO FACE REALITY.
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
THERE IS SOMETHING PROPRIETARY.
I HAVE A PATENT.
WHAT'S THE PATENT?
IT'S FOR A PORTABLE
AND DISPOSABLE
LIVING PATCH OF GRASS.
THERE'S A PATENT FOR THAT?
I HAVE IT.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY COMPETITION?
PEE PAD'S
AND SYNTHETIC GRASS,
AND WE DO HAVE A COMPANY THAT
IS INFRINGING ON OUR PATENT.
ARE -- ARE YOU
GONNA GO AFTER THEM?
I'M SUING THEM.
I'M MORE INTERESTED NOW
THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY I CAN SUE.
Cuban:
NO KIDDING, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S INTERESTING.
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT,
UM, IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,
YOU CAN GET THEIR CUSTOMERS
AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.
EXACTLY.
LET ME MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
BECAUSE I LIKE IT.
I JUST THINK IT'S SO SIMPLE,
AND IT COULD GROW,
AND THERE'S A LOT I COULD DO
TO HELP YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 33 1/3%.
JUST A STRAIGHT OFFER?
STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT UP.
DAMN.
I REALLY THINK
THIS COMPANY IS WORTH --
I KNOW THIS COMPANY
IS WORTH SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
WELL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY FLEXIBILITY
ON THE EQUITY
YOU'RE WILLING TO PART WITH?
I REALLY DON'T.
I WANTED TO COME IN HERE
AND GIVE YOU GUYS
A GOOD VALUATION
ON THIS COMPANY.
MY NAME IS NAUSHAD ALI,
AND I'M FROM WOODINVILLE,
WASHINGTON.
MY PRODUCT IS THE DRAIN STRAIN,
AND I'M HERE TODAY
SEEKING $110,000
FOR A 15% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
SHARKS, IF YOU'RE LIKE
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS,
AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER,
YOU'VE HAD A CLOGGED DRAIN.
AND YOU KNOW
IT IS SUCH A PAIN TO CLEAN.
YOU MIGHT GO HAIR-FISHING
WITH A HANGER
AND TOUCH WET, NASTY
CLUMPS OF HAIR.
THERE'S KEVIN'S HAIR.
DISGUSTING!
OR YOU MIGHT POUR
ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL
DRAIN CLEANERS IN YOUR SINK
AND WAIT PATIENTLY
TO SEE IF IT WORKS.
MY PRODUCT ELIMINATES
EXPENSIVE PLUMBING CALLS,
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.
YOU NEVER TOUCH THE GUNK!
I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE
THE REVOLUTIONARY DRAIN STRAIN
WITH TLC TECHNOLOGY.
SIMPLY TURN, LIFT, CLICK --
PROBLEM SOLVED.
NOW ATTACH A REPLACEMENT BASKET
TO THE STOPPER TOP,
INSERT BACK INTO YOUR SINK.
YOU'RE DONE!
SHARKS, IF YOU INVEST
IN MY COMPANY,
I PROMISE TO WORK HARD EVERY DAY
TO MAKE SURE YOUR MONEY
DOESN'T GO DOWN THE DRAIN.
ALL RIGHT, I THINK
PROBABLY THE BEST THING TO DO
IS GIVE YOU SOME SAMPLES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SO...
THANK YOU.
YEAH.
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU, ROBERT.
HERE.
Greiner: OH, THANK YOU.
ARE THESE PROTOTYPES,
OR IS THIS THE REAL THING?
YEAH, THOSE ARE 3-D --
THOSE ARE 3-D PROTOTYPES,
SO THEY'RE FRAGILE.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
YEAH, YOU BET.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, BASICALLY,
JUST TURN TO THE LEFT, LIFT.
YEAH, SO ONCE YOU LIFT IT OUT,
YOU SQUEEZE, AND IT --
Greiner: I'M CURIOUS.
DOESN'T THIS START
TO CLOG UP THIS
SO THAT YOU WOULD CONSTANTLY
BE HAVING TO CLEAN THIS OUT?
SO, WE HAVE IT IN OUR DRAIN
AT OUR HOME, RIGHT?
FOR HEAVY USE,
YOU -- YOU WOULD EXPECT
TO CHANGE THAT
ONCE EVERY FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.
O'Leary: SO, IN THE HISTORY
OF "SHARK TANK,"
THIS PRODUCT,
ABOVE ANY OTHER,
LENDS ITSELF TO A LICENSING DEAL
WITH MANUFACTURERS.
THE IDEA OF TAKING THIS
AS A PRODUCT ON ITS OWN
INTO RETAIL OR INTO DISTRIBUTION
IS A REALLY STUPID IDEA.
THE ONLY WAY THIS BECOMES
A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SUCCESS
IS IF YOU CAN CONVINCE
A MANUFACTURER OF PLUMBING
THAT THIS IS
A BETTER MOUSE TRAP.
ARE YOU
PREPARED TO DO THAT?
ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE LAUNCH STRATEGIES.
WHY AREN'T YOU AT KOHLER
AND THIS IS SIMPLY PART
OF THEIR NEW FAUCET LINE?
UH, I CERTAINLY PLAN TO BE.
IN FACT, I JUST GOT THE FINAL
PRODUCTION-READY DESIGNS
FOUR WEEKS AGO
IN MY HAND, YEAH.
SO THIS HASN'T EVEN BEEN
MANUFACTURED YET.
THESE ARE ALL PROTOTYPES.
THOSE ARE ALL 3-D PROTOTYPES,
BUT I'VE GOT SOURCING COSTS.
YEAH.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
SO, FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS,
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN A REALTOR.
MY BUSINESS WAS THRIVING,
AND THEN 2008 HIT, RIGHT?
AND THEN THE BOTTOM FELL OUT.
WE LITERALLY LOST EVERYTHING.
WE, UH, HAD OUR HOME
FORECLOSED ON.
WOW.
WOW.
AND I HAD TWO CHOICES
AT THAT POINT --
I COULD EITHER LAY ON THE MAT
OR FIGHT.
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET
MY CHILDREN SEE ME ON THE MAT.
AND I WAS NOT GONNA
LET THAT BE MY LEGACY.
SO I REFOCUSED,
GOT BACK ON MY FEET,
BACK IN REAL ESTATE,
AND LAST YEAR,
I'M PROUD TO SAY,
I WAS THE NUMBER 10
FULL-SERVICE REALTOR
IN THE ENTIRE STATE
OF WASHINGTON.
THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM US?
OBVIOUSLY,
I NEED YOUR EXPERIENCE.
I'M GOING TO GUESS
THAT WHEN YOU CALL THE C.E.O.
OF YOUR FAVORITE
PLUMBING COMPANY,
HE DOESN'T RETURN
YOUR CALL.
I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM.
EXACTLY.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
YOUR $110,000 FOR 20%.
BUT IT'S CONTINGENT
ON SIGNING A LICENSING DEAL
WITH A MANUFACTURER
OF YOUR CHOICE,
UNDER TERMS
OF YOUR CHOICE.
I'M GONNA NEGOTIATE THEM.
I SEE THE PATH TO MAKING
A LOT OF MONEY WITH THIS,
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW,
YOU MAY FIND ANOTHER SHARK.
LORI MAY WANT TO SIT ON QVC
WITH A SINK AND SOME GLOVES ON
AND WHATEVER ELSE,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON IT?
BAM!
NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THIS.
NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THIS.
SO YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
THE QUESTION IS,
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE MY OFFER,
OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT
ALL DAY
FOR THE REST
OF THESE SHARKETTES?
WELL, I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE OTHER
SHARKS AN OPPORTUNITY TO --
WELL, I'LL --
I'LL SIMPLIFY THINGS, GUYS.
IT'S A PROOF OF CONCEPT,
RIGHT, THAT YOU REALLY
HAVEN'T PROVEN YET.
IT'S A PRODUCT.
IT'S NOT A COMPANY.
FOR NAUSHAD'S
DRAIN-CLOG SOLUTION,
DRAIN STRAIN.
BUT ROBERT IS ALSO INTERESTED.
Herjavec: TO TAKE 20% FROM YOU
FOR, REALLY, MAKING A PHONE CALL
JUST DOESN'T SEEM
FAIR TO ME.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $110,000.
I THINK YOUR ASK FOR 15%
WAS TOO HIGH.
I'M WILLING TO TAKE 10%.
SO I'LL GIVE YOU $110,000,
SAME CONTINGENCY AS KEVIN,
BUT I WANT 10%.
BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION,
I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY.
ALL SHARKS WILL LEARN,
ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE ANCIENT TIMES.
APOLLO, A VERY POWERFUL GOD,
WAS DATING A NYMPH.
LOVED HER,
ALL RIGHT?
BUT SO WAS THE FISHERMAN
POMPILUS
INTERESTED IN THE NYMPH.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND HE CONVINCED HER
TO RUN AWAY FROM APOLLO.
BIG MISTAKE.
HERE'S WHY.
WHAT HAPPENS IS APOLLO DAMNED
THE FISHERMAN TO ETERNITY
TO COME BACK FOREVER
AS A PILOT FISH,
DEPENDENT
ON A GREAT WHITE SHARK.
PILOT FISH ONLY EXISTS
OFF THE SCRAPS...
YOU NEED A CHART
FOR THIS ONE.
...THAT ARE INSIDE THE MOUTH
OF THE SHARK
IN A FEEDING FRENZY.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
THE POINT I'M MAKING IS...
THERE IS A POINT?
...I'M WORTH 10% MORE
BECAUSE I JUST AM.
IF YOU WANT
THE DISCOUNT PILOT FISH,
TAKE THE DEAL, ALL RIGHT?
BUT YOU TO DECIDE, THOUGH.
YOU GOT TO DECIDE.
AND KNOW WITH CERTAINTY
THAT HE'LL ALWAYS BE DEPENDENT
ON THE BIG SHARK.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
KEVIN,
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.
BUT I THINK THE SHARKS,
EVEN THE PILOT FISH
THAT YOU CALL -- [ LAUGHS ]
I'M NOT A PILOT FISH,
GOSH DARN IT!
ACTUALLY, CAN I -- CAN I
JUST TALK TO MY WIFE REAL QUICK?
WHAT?!
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR WIFE? WHY WOULD YOU --
NO.
NO WAY, NAUSHAD.
NO. NO.
YOU CAN MAKE THAT DECISION.
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.
DON'T BLOW IT BY STALLING,
PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT.
ROBERT,
I'D LOVE TO DO A DEAL WITH YOU.
DONE.
HE TOOK THE PILOT FISH.
TAKE THAT, BIG SHOT.
WELL, YOU KNOW --
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, ROBERT?
I THINK, UH, YOU HAVE A GREAT
PHILOSOPHY, MY WIFE LOVES YOU,
AND I THINK YOU'D BE
A GOOD PERSON TO WORK WITH.
I AM A GOOD PERSON TO WORK WITH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
TAKE CARE, YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Herjavec: KEVIN.
YES, LITTLE PILOT?
LET'S GO BACK TO THAT STORY.
HOW DOES THE STORY END NOW?
AH, LIVE AND LEARN.
FOR MY FAMILY,
THIS IS A WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE FOR MY CHILDREN
TO SEE THAT WE CAN BOUNCE BACK
OFF THE MAT
AND MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE
IS THE LEGACY I WANT TO LEAVE
FOR THEM.
Narrator: IN SEASON FOUR,
COREY WARD AND TREW QUACKENBUSH
MADE A DEAL
WITH BARBARA CORCORAN
FOR THEIR GRILLED-CHEESE
FRANCHISE, TOM+CHEE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'D SAY WE TAKE THE DEAL.
Narrator:
LET'S SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING NOW.
I, JOHN CRANLEY,
MAYOR OF THE CITY OF CINCINNATI,
DO HEREBY PROCLAIM TOM+CHEE DAY
HERE IN THE CITY OF CINCINNATI.
[ CHEERS ]
Ward: BECAUSE OF OUR
ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE CITY,
THE MAYOR HAS DECLARED IT
TOM+CHEE DAY.
IN THE YEAR LEADING UP
TO "SHARK TANK,"
WE'D DONE A MILLION DOLLARS
IN SALES.
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW,
AND WE'VE GROSSED
OVER $14 MILLION.
LET'S GIVE THAT ONE
A TASTE FIRST.
Corcoran: COREY AND TREW
ARE GREAT RESTAURATEURS,
AND OLDEST MANUFACTURER
IN AUSTRALIA.
WHO?
A.H. BEARD.
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
Cuban: SO, WHAT'S
THE SECRET SAUCE IN THE DEVICE?
SO, WHAT SEPARATES US FROM
EVERYONE WHO'S COME BEFORE --
WE ARE THE ONLY PRODUCT
THAT IS ULTRA-RAPID, OKAY?
EVERY OTHER PRODUCT --
OKAY, NO, NO, WAIT.
BEFORE YOU GO AND PITCH ME,
RIGHT,
I ASKED A QUESTION.
'CAUSE WHAT I WANT
IS A TECHNICAL ANSWER.
I WANT
A TECHNICAL ANSWER
ON WHY THAT'S BETTER
OR DIFFERENT
OR WHATEVER YOU THINK
YOUR SECRET SAUCE IS
IN THE DEVICE.
OKAY, THERE'S NO PRODUCT
IN THE WORLD
THAT WILL HEAT
A KING-SIZE BED
TO FEEL LIKE THE SHEETS CAME OUT
OF THE DRYER IN THREE MINUTES.
AND WHAT ALLOWS
THAT TO HAPPEN?
AGAIN, I ASKED --
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE PITCH.
WE'RE THE ONLY PRODUCT
THAT USES DIRECT CONVECTION AIR
INTO THE BED TO COOL YOU
AND HEAT YOU.
AND NOW --
SO YOU'RE LIKE A CONVECTION OVEN
THAT JUST TAKES THE OUTPUT
AND JUST BLOWS IT IN
UNDERNEATH THE SHEETS.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN SEND
1,500 WATTS OF POWER
INTO A BED SAFELY.
