HI. I'M LIZ MOSKOW.
AND I'M ABBY SCHWALB.
LIZ AND I ARE CO-FOUNDERS
OF BALM CHICKY BALM BALM.
WE'RE HERE TODAY SEEKING
A $75,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 20%
EQUITY STAKE IN OUR COMPANY.
EVERYONE HERE HAS USED
A LIP BALM, RIGHT?
AND FRIENDS,
CO-WORKERS, RELATIVES,
NOT TO MENTION
GERMY CHILDREN,
FIND THE NEED TO BORROW
AND RUN THEIR LIPS
ALL OVER YOUR BALM.
WELL, WE'VE COME UP
WITH A SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM.
INTRODUCING...
? BALM CHICKY BALM BALM ?
A SEXY,
'70s-INSPIRED LIP-BALM BRAND
WITH ONE SPECIAL PACKAGE.
WHAT IS THAT PACKAGE?
IT'S THE FRIEND END TUBE,
DESIGNED TO LET PEOPLE SHARE
THEIR PERSONAL-CARE PRODUCTS
WITHOUT SHARING
ANY NASTY GERMS.
HOW DOES THAT WORK?
MY LIPS ARE SO DRY.
CAN I BORROW YOUR BALM?
YOU SURE CAN.
YOU'RE GIVING ME
THE FRIEND END?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN.
THIS IS SO TRUE.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE FRIEND END PROVIDES
A SEPARATE POT OF BALM
ON THE FLIP SIDE.
THIS ALLOWS ITS OWNER TO BE
GENEROUS WITH THEIR LIP BALM
WHILE KEEPING THEIR SIDE
PRISTINE AND CLEAN,
GERM-FREE
FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL USE.
THUS TRANSFORMING AN ORDINARY,
EVERYDAY-USE PRODUCT
LIKE LIP BALM
INTO A SHARABLE AND SPREADABLE
CONVERSATION PIECE.
WHO'S HOT TO TROT
AND READY TO BECOME
GREAT BEDFELLOWS
WITH
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM?
Corcoran:
SO, LISTEN, ABBY,
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE --
WHO WOULD EVEN THINK OF IT?
[ CHUCKLES ] RIGHT?
WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT WE DO BEST
IS THINK OF VERY STRANGE IDEAS
AND SORT OF PURSUE THEM.
AND WHO ACTUALLY CARES?
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
THAT ANSWER, TOO.
HOW DID YOU THINK OF IT?
KEVIN!
WELL, UM,
WE'RE BOTH BALM FREAKS.
WE LIKE TO USE LIP BALM.
WE LIVE IN THE MOUNTAINS.
WE SKI,
AND OFTEN WE FIND
THAT ANYTIME YOU PULL OUT
A LIP BALM, LIKE YAWNING,
LIP-BALM BORROWING
IS RAMPANT.
DO WE GET TO SEE IT?
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND CAN YOU TELL US
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY SELLING ANY?
THAT WOULD PROVE THAT MAYBE
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THIS IDEA.
WE'RE CURRENTLY
IN OVER 60 STORES
IN BOTH THE U.K., CANADA,
AND THE U.S.
Greiner: THANK YOU.
HEY, LORI,
CAN I BORROW YOUR BALM?
SURE, ROBERT.
HERE'S MY FRIEND END.
Cuban:
CAN I JUST ASK --
ARE THE RETAIL STORES,
UM, ADULT NOVELTY STORES?
Moskow: RIGHT. BUT IT'S NOT
A CONVERSATION PIECE.
UH-OH.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THEY WANT TO SHARE.
Cuban:
YEAH, BUT PEOPLE DON'T GIVE
THAT MUCH THOUGHT
TO THEIR LIP-BALM PURCHASING.
GUYS, LOOK,
HERE-- HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
YOU GUYS HAVE GOT A PRODUCT,
NOT A COMPANY YET,
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TURN IT INTO A COMPANY.
AND THAT'S ALWAYS HARD.
BUT WHAT YOU DO HAVE ALSO
IS A NICHE.
SELLING THESE
IN ADULT-ENTERTAINMENT LOCATIONS
IS GREAT.
RUN WITH THAT.
MAKE SOME MONEY OFF OF IT.
WIN THE BATTLE YOU'RE IN
BEFORE TRYING TO TURN THIS
INTO A REAL COMPANY.
WE'VE SPOKEN
TO INDUSTRY EXPERTS
ABOUT THE NAME
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM,
AND THEY HAVE SAID
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM IS GOLD.
I-IT'S NOT GOLD,IT'S CUTE,
AND THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC,
CATCHY NAME.
BUT REALLY
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IS HAVING THE GREAT PRODUCT.
BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN
THINK OF A GREAT NAME.
DID YOU TRY THE PRODUCT?
I DID TRY IT.
I TRIED THE FRIEND END,
WHERE I HAD TO GO IN,
WITH MY FINGER,
AND I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
LADIES, I --
A COUPLE
OF CHALLENGES.
MOST BUYERS ARE YOUNGER-SKEWED,
LIKE KIDS, TEENAGERS, AND SO ON.
I'M NOT SURE
I WANT MY KIDS
BUYING SOMETHING
WITH AN ADULT THEME
AND IT HAS THE FRIEND END,
WHICH IS GREAT FOR TEENAGERS.
BUT YOU KNOW, ABBY,
THAT'S REALLY MY CHALLENGE.
EVERY TIME WE GAVE YOU
AN OBJECTION, YOU SAID,
"WE CAN DO THAT, TOO."
WE'RE FLEXIBLE.
WE'RE FLEXIBLE.
"WE CAN DO THAT, TOO."
WE CAN.
WE CAN DO IT ALL.
IT'S GREAT TO PIVOT,
BUT YOU CAN'T PIVOT
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.
AND $17,000
IS NOT A PROOF OF CONCEPT.
I DON'T SEE THE COMPANY.
I JUST SEE
A FUN, HIP, COOL NAME.
I HAVE TO SAY IT
ONE MORE TIME BEFORE I'M OUT --
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM.
I'M OUT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, I-IF I HAD TO DREAM UP
A BUSINESS PLAN,
