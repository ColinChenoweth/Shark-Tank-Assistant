AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
I DID THE TRADEMARK.
YOU KNOW, I DO CUSTOMER SERVICE.
SO IT'S BEEN ALL
DO-IT-YOURSELF SO FAR.
YEAH, I'M DOING EVERYTHING.
I'M GONNA WAIT TO HEAR
WHAT MARK SAYS.
OKAY.
YOU'RE SITTING BACK,
WAITING IN THE WINGS.
I ALWAYS DO.
SO, HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
I AGREE WITH BARBARA
THAT IT IS A RETAIL PLAY
IN MAJOR VERTICAL CITIES.
BUT I ALSO SEE IT
AS A TECH PLAY,
WHICH IS
THE MOST INTERESTING TO ME.
SO YOU'RE LEAVING
A TON OF MONEY ON THE TABLE,
AND YOU KNOW IT, RIGHT?
I AGREE.
SO, I WANT TO PARTNER
WITH BARBARA ON THIS.
I ALREADY SAID YES.
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
OVER THE YEARS
IS THAT WE EACH HAVE
OUR OWN SKILL SETS.
SO, TECHNOLOGY
TENDS TO BE MINE,
AND BARBARA DOES A GREAT JOB
AT RETAIL,
PARTICULARLY
WITHIN NEW YORK CITY.
WHAT WE DO IS,
WE'LL TAKE OVER YOUR ACCOUNTING.
WE'LL TAKE OVER YOUR WEBSITE
AND ACCELERATE YOUR GROWTH
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ANY OF THAT.
YOU CAN FOCUS
ON WHAT YOU DO.
Herjavec: MAN, THIS IS GONNA BE
AN AWFUL OFFER.
HE'S REALLY SELLING.
WHAT I'M GONNA SAY IS --
SO WHAT IS THE DEAL?
YEAH, WHAT'S THE DEAL?
THE DEAL IS THE SAME
AS WHAT BARBARA OFFERED.
$150,000 FOR 20%,
AND YOU GET TWO SHARKS,
BUT YOU GOT TO DECIDE
RIGHT NOW.
Feld:
I WENT WITH MARK AND BARBARA
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE BEST TWO
TO HELP ME MAKE
THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS I NEED
WITH THIS COMPANY,
WITH THE WEBSITE
AND THE BRANDING
AND JUST GROWING IT
TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK ARE FRIENDS
WITH A NEW TWIST ON LIP BALM.
YES AND NO.
YES AND NO.
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, MARK.
THERE'S NOTHING WITH THAT.
BUT, I MEAN, ALL THE PACKAGING.
I MEAN...
WE'D LOVE TO TELL YOU MORE
ABOUT THAT.
I BET YOU WOULD,
SO GO AHEAD.
YES, WE WOULD.
WE CAME UP WITH THIS
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM LABEL
AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT IDEA
FOR THE FRIEND END.
SO THEN, WHAT WE DECIDED WAS
THAT WE WANT TO GO AFTER MASS.
WE THINK THAT IT HAS
VARIOUS LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES
BECAUSE OUR PATENT
NOT ONLY COVERS THIS SHAPE TUBE,
IT COVERS ANY SHAPE TUBE
THAT'S COMPRISED
OF A LIFT DEVICE --
EITHER A TWIST, A PUSH-UP,
OR A LIFT --
WITH A STATIONARY POT
ON THE BOTTOM.
Herjavec: LOVE THE NAME.
HOW MANY ARE YOU SELLING TODAY,
IF YOU'RE SELLING ANY?
WE'VE SOLD, UM,
$17,000 WORTH OF BALM.
SORRY. $17,000?
DOLLARS.
O'Leary: IS THAT ENOUGH
TO KEEP IT IN RETAIL?
'CAUSE YOU SAID
YOU HAD 60 STORES.
YES.
YOU'RE SELLING
.00-NOTHING-BURGER PER STORE.
THE FACTS ARE
WE CREATED IT
JUST TO GET
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN RUNNING.
WE HAVE A MOLD,
WE HAVE THE PATENT ON THE TUBE,
AND SO WE WANTED TO SEE
IF WE CAN GET INTO STORES
WITH NO MONEY
PUT TOWARDS MARKETING.
$17,000 IN SALES IN THIS MARKET,
IT'S DEPRESSING.
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?
THIS IS $4.50 WHOLESALE
AND $9.50 RETAIL
RIGHT NOW.
WHAT IS THE PRICE
OF AN AVERAGE LIP BALM?
A REGULAR SIZE --
EVEN THOUGH --
EVEN THOUGH
IT'S SMALLER THAN THIS,
A REGULAR SIZE,
WHAT DOES IT COST?
THE AVERAGE COST OF
A VERY SMALL LIP BALM IS $2.59.
SO FOR $2.59,
THEY COULD TECHNICALLY
BUY THREE
FOR LESS MONEY THAN YOUR ONE.
IN A GENERAL MARKET.
FOR A NICHE MARKET,
THAT'S FANTASTIC
IF YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT
IN ADULT STORES.
BUT WE CAN ALSO PUT,
VERY EASILY, A LABEL ON HERE
THAT IT IS INTENDED
FOR THOSE PEOPLE,
GETTING MARKET SHARE
IN THE LIP-BALM SPACE
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
ON THE TOP OF MY LIST.
YOU'RE
SINGLE-CELL-AMOEBA PLAYERS.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN COCKROACHES.
Herjavec: KEVIN, I'M NOT CLEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
ARE YOU IN,
OR ARE YOU OUT?
I'M SAYING
IT'S A BAD WASTE OF TIME...
I THINK I HAVE A GUESS.
...BOTH YOURS AND MINE.
AND I'M GONNA BURN IT MYSELF
IF YOU DON'T.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANKS.
I THINK
YOU HAVE A CUTE NAME,
BUT I LOVE A PRODUCT
THAT SOLVES A SIMPLE PROBLEM,
AND I DON'T REALLY THINK
THERE'S A PROBLEM OUT THERE
THAT YOU HAVE TO SOLVE
WITH THIS.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
I HAVE VERY FEW BUSINESSES
THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
REINVENTED THREE TIMES OVER
BEFORE THEY BECAME
GOOD SELLERS.
DO NOT ENCOURAGE THEM, BARBARA.
I FORBID IT.
NO, I'M GONNA ENCOURAGE YOU.
YOU'RE REINVENTING IT
AS YOU GO,
SEEING WHAT'S WRONG,
MAKING A LITTLE MOVEMENT
TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
RIGHT INTO A TRAIN.
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND
A WAY TO DO IT,
BUT I HAVE TO RELUCTANTLY SAY
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, BARBARA.
I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY CALL YOU
MR. WONDERFUL.
NOW YOU KNOW.
I TELL THE TRUTH.
YOU'VE GOT
A PROFITABLE NICHE
THAT YOU SHOULD BE EXPLOITING --
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT.
EXPLOIT THE NICHE
THAT YOU HAVE SUCCESS AT...
I AGREE.
AND YOU WILL MAKE
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.
NOT EVERY BUSINESS
IS GOING TO BE
A MILLION-DOLLAR
OR $5 MILLION --
IF YOU GUYS ARE SELLING
$200,000 WORTH OF LIP BALM
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS DROP-SHIP
FROM YOUR MANUFACTURER,
AND YOU'RE PUTTING $100,000
IN YOUR POCKET
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING...
BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO DO
ALL OF THIS,
YOU ARE GOING TO GROW YOURSELF
OUT OF BUSINESS.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
WIN THE BATTLES
YOU'RE IN FIRST.
OR KNOW THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LOSE WITH CERTAINTY
AND DON'T BOTHER
FIGHTING IT.
CAN WE HAVE THAT NOT BE
THE LAST WORD AS WE WALK OUT?
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
YOU KNOW THAT LAST WORD'S
GONNA BE?
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM!
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM!
THERE YOU GO.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
THIS IS HORRIBLE.
MR. NOT-SO-WONDERFUL.
[ LAUGHS ]
Moskow: WHAT'S NEXT
FOR BALM CHICKY BALM BALM
IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE
INTO MASS SO THAT EVERYONE
FROM GRANNIES TO TODDLERS
WILL BE SAYING...
? BALM CHICKY BALM BALM ?
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
WHO BELIEVES HE HAS A SOLUTION
TO THE PROBLEM
OF CHRONICALLY CLOGGED DRAINS.
IT'S NOT YOUR PRIMARY FOCUS.
MARK...
DON'T GO OUT.
THERE'S OTHER -- I MEAN,
THERE'S A BATHTUB VERSION
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.
IT'S NOT JUST A PRODUCT.
THE MOST DIFFICULT
ENTREPRENEURS TO WORK WITH
ARE INVENTORS
BECAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED
ON INVENTING,
AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING
COMPANIES.
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT PURSUING
ANYTHING ELSE
UNTIL I GET THIS THING --
YOU'VE GOT A --
Y-YOU'RE THE NUMBER 10 REALTOR
IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.
MM-HMM.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WORKING HARD?
LOOK, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
IF THIS GOT TO THAT POINT
WHERE IT REQUIRED
YOUR FULL-TIME USE,
I'M JUST MAKING THE ASSUMPTION
YOU WOULD DO IT FULL TIME.
YEAH.
THIS IS 100% MY PASSION.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
THAT PATH.
RIGHT.
IF YOU DECIDE --
BECAUSE YOU CONTROL IT --
THAT YOU TAKE
THE LICENSE DEAL,
ALL OF THAT IS TAKEN AWAY
FROM YOU, AND YOU CAN GO BACK
TO REINVENTING
THE NEXT GREAT THING.
THAT'S THE OTHER PART
I REALLY LIKE.
I THINK,
UNDER A DEAL LIKE KEVIN,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
YOU KNOW, UH,
WE HAD JEFF FOXWORTHY
ON THE SHOW MANY SEASONS AGO.
HE CALLED IT, UH,
MAILBOX MONEY.
RIGHT.
YOU GET THE CHECK EVERY MONTH.
YEAH, YOU JUST GO
TO THE MAILBOX,
AND YOU GET A CHECK
FROM THE ROYALTY.
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.
YEAH.
ARE YOU SOLD
ON THAT BEING THE RIGHT PATH?
I DON'T WANT TO GO ON
AN ALL-OR-NOTHING DEAL.
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU
TO HAVE THIS PRODUCT?
TO HAVE THE PRODUCT?
90 DAYS.
DO YOU HAVE THE CASH
TO FUND THAT --
THE TOOLING
AND THE MANUFACTURING?
THAT'S PART OF WHAT
THE MONEY IS FOR.
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'D USE
THE MONEY FOR.
I DON'T WANT TO GO
PRODUCE SOMETHING
UNTIL WE'VE GOT DEALS,
RIGHT?
OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK KEVIN'S DEAL
IS THE RIGHT DEAL FOR YOU.
THAT'S THE WAY TO GO.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE NUTS
SELLING THIS
AS AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT.
I'M OUT.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
BUT THANK YOU.
I THINK IT'S CLEVER.
BUT IT JUST SEEMS
VERY COMPLICATED TO ME.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TESTING
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE FIRST THINGS,
NATURALLY, WHAT YOU WOULD DO.
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT THIS IS GONNA WORK.
AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
THE PROOF HERE OF THAT.
I THINK IT'S TRICKY,
SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
WELL, THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I THINK THE LARGE
FAUCET MANUFACTURERS
ARE EITHER GONNA ADOPT IT
OR THEY'RE NOT.
AND IF THEY DO ADOPT IT,
YOU CAN DO MULTIPLE
LICENSING DEALS.
KEVIN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
EVERYBODY RETURNS
HIS PHONE CALL.
THE PROBLEM IS, NOBODY EVER
TALKS TO KEVIN A SECOND TIME.
YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOOD
TO BE RUTHLESS
AND -- AND NASTY
AND MEAN IN BUSINESS.
YES, IT IS. YES, IT IS.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
OVER THE LONG TERM,
I'VE FOUND THAT IT'S ALSO
VERY GOOD TO BE NICE.
AND IT'S GOOD TO DO DEALS
WHERE BOTH SIDES MAKE MONEY.
I LIKE THE STRUCTURE --
$110,000.
BUT TO TAKE 20% FROM YOU
FOR, REALLY, MAKING A PHONE CALL
JUST DOESN'T SEEM
FAIR TO ME.
ALL RIGHT.
SO...
HERE'S MY OFFER.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
KEVIN HAS MADE AN OFFER
OF $110,000 FOR A 20% STAKE,
CONTINGENT ON SECURING
A LICENSING DEAL
GREAT MARKETERS,
AND THEY'VE WORKED
THEIR BUTTS OFF.
FIVE YEARS AGO,
THEY'RE IN A TENT HERE
SELLING GRILLED CHEESE,
AND TODAY
THEY HAVE A CHEESE EMPIRE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
HEY, EVERYBODY!
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
FOR TOM+CHEE SO FAR
HAS BEEN RETAIL SPACE.
WE'RE COMPETING
AGAINST THE BIG BOYS.
WITH BARBARA'S KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE,
SHE'S REALLY HELPED
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD.
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD 3 LOCATIONS
AND 70 EMPLOYEES.
WE NOW HAVE 19 LOCATIONS
AND OVER 500 EMPLOYEES
WORKING FOR US.
WE'VE RECEIVED
OVER 25,000 FRANCHISE REQUESTS.
SOON, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND
TOM+CHEE IN ALL 50 STATES
AND IN COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA
AND MEXICO AND IRELAND,
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES --
PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE.
JOB WELL DONE.
AS A SHARK, THIS IS WHAT
I DREAM ABOUT GETTING.
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
EVERY DAY.
THIS IS JUST AN AMAZING
AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY.
WE STARTED WITH AN IDEA
AND $2,400.
WE'RE GROWING THIS
INTO A MULTINATIONAL BRAND.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
OUR GRILLED CHEESE
AND ALL THOSE SMILES
AROUND THE WORLD.
CHEESE!
CHEESE!
CHEESE!
CHEESE!
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A PRODUCT
TO ENSURE YOUR BED IS ALWAYS
AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MARK ARAMLI.
I'M FROM THE BEAUTIFUL CITY
OF NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND.
MY COMPANY IS BEDJET,
AND I'M SEEKING $250,000
FOR 10% OF THE COMPANY.
IN THE WINTERTIME,
NEVER GET
INTO ANOTHER CHILLY BED
WITH COLD FEET EVER AGAIN.
THE BEDJET IS THE WORLD'S FIRST
ULTRA-RAPID AND AFFORDABLE
COOLING, HEATING,
AND CLIMATE-CONTROL SYSTEM
DESIGNED JUST FOR OUR BEDS
AT HOME.
SIMPLY PLACE THE BASE UNIT
UNDER THE BED,
PUT THE NOZZLE
INTO YOUR BEDDING.
WE GIVE YOUR BEDDING
THAT LUXURIOUS, HOT-TOWEL,
JUST-OUT-OF-THE-DRYER FEEL
IN ONLY THREE MINUTES
FROM THE TOUCH OF A REMOTE.
REMOTE CONTROLS INCLUDE
OUR INTELLIGENT SMARTPHONE APP.
YOU CAN EVEN PROGRAM
A BEDJET ALARM
TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING
WITH A COOL BLAST OF AIR.
AH.
NOW, THE BEDJET
PAYS FOR ITSELF.
WHY HEAT OR COOL THE WHOLE HOUSE
OR EVEN BEDROOM AT NIGHT
WHEN ALL THAT MATTERS
FOR THOSE EIGHT HOURS
IS THE TEMPERATURE
BETWEEN THE SHEETS.
SHARKS, THAT'S THE BEDJET.
IF ANY OF YOU STILL HAVE
COLD FEET ON JOINING THE TEAM
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE HEARD,
THAT'S OKAY.
WE'LL WARM THEM UP
RIGHT OVER HERE.
CAN WE TRY IT?
YES.
MARK, HOW MUCH NOISE
DOES IT MAKE?
IT'S QUIETER
THAN ANY FAN.
IT'S QUIETER
THAN ANY ROOM AIR CONDITIONER.
OH! I'M GETTING IN BED
WITH MARK.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S ABOUT
THE SAME LEVEL...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT?"
...OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD
HVAC REGISTER.
MOVE OVER, BUDDY.
WOW. IS THAT A WATER MATTRESS
YOU HAVE THERE?
NO.
UH, WE ARE JUST SENDING AIR
INTO THE BED
SO IT GIVES US
A LITTLE PUFFING.
WAIT.
THERE'S MORE.
50% OF COUPLES HAVE DIFFERENT
SLEEP-TEMPERATURE PREFERENCES.
HE LIKES IT HOT,
SHE LIKES IT COOL.
THERE'S ALWAYS A FIGHT
OVER THE THERMOSTAT.
THE BEDJET
HAS DUAL-ZONE CAPABILITY.
WHAT'S IT LIKE, LORI?
MY -- MY SIDE IS HOT.
I FEEL HOT AIR. RIGHT?
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S COOL.
I MEAN,
IT FEELS GOOD ON MY FEET.
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
HOW DO YOU HOOK IT UP?
WE HAVE A NOZZLE HERE.
IF WE'RE GONNA DO DUAL ZONE,
WE PLUG IT INTO THIS.
SO, LIKE, THERE'S
A SPECIAL SHEET, RIGHT?
SO YOU PUT A SPECIAL SHEET THERE
THAT HAS THE HOLE AT THE BOTTOM?
ONLY FOR DUAL ZONE.
IF IT'S SINGLE ZONE,
RIGHT, JUST ONE --
SINGLE ZONE,
WE JUST HAVE THIS LITTLE GUY,
AND YOU'VE GOT THE SHEET
THROWN OVER HIM,
AND HE'S SENDING --
OKAY, SO THAT JUST POPS
ON THE EDGE OF THE BED,
AND IT JUST BLOWS OUT
COLD OR HOT AIR.
YOU GOT IT.
SO THAT KEEPS IT SIMPLE.
BUT ALSO, TOO,
IS THERE TWO DIFFERENT,
UM, ATTACHMENT HOSES?
THERE'S TWO MACHINES,
SO YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE
INSTALLED
ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Corcoran: YOU SET A TIMER
SO YOU COULD COOL IT DOWN
FOR 10 MINUTES,
AND IT TURNS ITSELF OFF.
YEAH.
SO, WE HAVE
AUTO-SHUTOFF TIMERS
WHICH ARE VARIABLE,
DEPENDING ON WHETHER
YOU'RE HEATING OR COOLING.
PROVE TO ME
THE MARKET CARES.
YEAH, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE ECONOMICS.
GIVE US YOUR SALES.
OKAY, WE ARE GOING
INTO PRODUCTION IN SIX WEEKS.
OH, THERE ARE NO SALES.
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS?
I USED TO BE AN ENGINEER
ON THE NASA SPACE-SUIT PROGRAM.
OH, WOW.
AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR SOME OF THE COOLING
AND HEATING
AND CLIMATE-CONTROL SYSTEMS
OF THE SUIT.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?
UH, $98.
UH, WE HAVE A, UH,
MARKET TEST
THAT WE DID VIA KICKSTARTER.
WE SOLD MORE THAN $50,000
WORTH OF PRODUCT.
WHAT WAS THE, UM,
PRICE PER UNIT?
UH, THE RETAIL PRICE FOR THIS
IS GONNA BE $499.
O'Leary: OHH!
WOW!
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN A MATTRESS.
HOUSTON, WE GOT A PROBLEM.
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED
SINCE WE STARTED SELLING,
OKAY?
OKAY.
WE HAD OUR FIRST TRADE SHOW
IN LAS VEGAS,
WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
TRADE SHOWS
FOR THE SLEEP-PRODUCT
AND BEDDING INDUSTRY.
DURING THE SHOW,
SOMETHING MAGIC HAPPENED.
EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PLAYER
IN THE BEDDING INDUSTRY
CAME TO US AND SAID,
"WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS.
"WE WANT THIS.
"WE HAVE BUYER SAMPLE REQUESTS
WITH INTENT
TO PUT INTO THE MARKET
FROM MATTRESS FIRM."
MARK, THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.
THESE ARE THE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS, OKAY?
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHEN THE CONSUMER
WALKS UP TO THAT MACHINE
AND THEY SEE IT'S $500,
THEY SAY,
"WOW, I CAN GET A BRAND-NEW BED
FOR THAT PRICE."
I THINK THE PRICE
IS NUTS.
AT THE LAS VEGAS SHOW, OKAY,
WE HAVE NOW SIGNED UP RETAILERS
WHO ARE GETTING SAMPLES...
WHO DO YOU HAVE?
...AND WHO WANT TO PUT THIS
INTO THE MARKET.
NAME THE NAME.
SIT 'N SLEEP.
YOU WILL NEVER SELL THIS DEVICE
FOR $499.
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
WHY DON'T WE HEAR...
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.
...WHAT THOSE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS SAID?
MR. WONDERFUL --
NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.
THE DEVIL HIMSELF
WON'T PAY YOU FOR THAT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ORDERS
AT THAT PRICE POINT?
WE HAVE A P.O.
FOR $1.1 MILLION.
REALLY?
FROM WHO?
THAT CAME IN, UH,
JUST LAST WEEK, OKAY?
THIS IS THE LARGEST
MATTRESS MANUFACTURER
MARK, YOU HAD MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS.
THAT, TO ME,
IS THE BIGGER KAHUNA.
WHY?
NO, IT ISN'T.
MARK, WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU
THEY WANTED TO DO?
DID THEY SAY,
"WE WANT TO HAVE MEETINGS
WITH YOU LATER"?
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THEM
TALKING TO YOU?
SO, SLEEP TEMPERATURE
AND SLEEP SCIENCE
IS MORE AND MORE IDENTIFYING,
UH, SLEEPING TEMPERATURE
AS HAVING A DEEP IMPACT
ON RESTFUL SLEEP.
O'Leary: LISTEN, LISTEN.
LOOK, THAT'S GREAT,
BUT I CAN SEE
MR. AND MRS. SCHLEBINSKI
WALKING IN TO BUY
A NEW MATTRESS,
AND MRS. SCHLEBINSKI
SAYS TO MR. SCHLEBINSKI,
"HONEY,
WHAT'S THAT BEDJET THERE?"
AND HE SAYS, "WOW, IT SAYS
IT HEATS OR COOLS OUR BED."
AND SHE SAYS,
"HONEY, LET'S GET IT."
AND HE SAYS,
"HOW MUCH IS IT?"
AND HE GOES, "$500!"
THEY BOTH A HEART ATTACK
AND THEY LEAVE.
DO THEY?
THERE'S 3--
I DON'T KNOW.
WHEN CAN I FIND OUT?
THERE ARE 300 MILLION BEDROOMS
IN AMERICA.
I GET ALL THAT.
NO, YOU DON'T.
THE MARKET'S SO BIG.
MY COST OF GOODS SOLD...
I WANT TO BACK
TO WHAT I ASKED YOU.
MARK, MARK, IGNORE HIM.
...IS AT 1,000 UNITS PER LOT.
MARK, IGNORE HIM.
YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL.
YOU'VE OVERPRICED IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PIG.
QUIET!
OHH. OY VEY.
WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING
ABOUT WHAT THE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS --
MARK,
I HAVE A SIMPLE QUESTION.
MARK, IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME,
I'M GOING OUT.
WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS PRODUCT?
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.
I'M OUT.
MARK, IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME,
I'M GOING OUT.
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.
I'M OUT.
'CAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN SELL ANY.
NO, I ASKED HIM FIVE TIMES
TO ANSWER MY QUESTION,
HE IGNORED ME,
AND NOW I'M OUT.
I-I'M VERY, VERY SORRY, LORI.
SORRY.
IT'S -- IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS.
I GET IT,
BUT I WAS SHOUTING.
COULD YOU PLEASE
ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN?
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT.
NO.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
THE PATH FORWARD IS FOR THIS.
WE BELIEVE MARKET ENTRY FOR THIS
IS AN ASSISTED SALE.
IT NEEDS TO BE SOLD
WHERE PEOPLE BUY MATTRESSES,
SO THERE IS A PREMIUM MARKET
OUT THERE THAT IS MASSIVE.
Cuban: MARK, I THINK
IT'S A COOL PRODUCT, RIGHT?
WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
IS THAT,
WHEN I ASKED
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY,
YOU KEPT ON SELLING.
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE VIBE.
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ALL
THE PIECES YET TO GO FORWARD,
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
MARK,
YOU MENTIONED, CLEARLY,
THAT THIS IS INTENDED TARGETED
TO THE PREMIUM-MATTRESS BUYER.
BEYOND PREMIUM.
THAT 25% --
BUT THAT'S YOUR SWEET SPOT,
RIGHT?
HERE'S MY OBJECTION TO IT.
MOST OF THE PREMIUM BUYERS TODAY
ARE NOT BUYING THIS STYLE BED.
THE UPHOLSTERED BED
THAT ALMOST HITS THE FLOOR
IS THE MOST COMMONLY
SOLD BED TODAY.
MY BED WOULDN'T FIT THAT
UNDER THERE
BECAUSE I HAVE
A LOVELY UPHOLSTERED BED.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA SELL WELL HERE.
I WISH I BELIEVED YOU,
BUT I DON'T. I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
I SEE CATASTROPHE.
I SEE DISASTER.
I SEE BLACK CLOUDS,
DEVASTATION, TOTAL COLLAPSE.
HERE'S WHAT
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE.
YOU'RE GONNA SHIP OUT
A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS
WORTH OF INVENTORY,
TRY AND SELL IT AT $499
AT SPECIALTY-MATTRESS STORES.
IT'S GONNA SIT THERE.
IT'S NOT GONNA TURN.
THE NIGHT STAFF
ARE GONNA TRY AND USE IT
TO ACTUALLY WASH
THE CARPETS.
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.
[ LAUGHS ]
THE PRODUCT IS DEAD ALREADY.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
Cuban: [ LAUGHS ]
WHY WOULD YOU THANK HIM
FOR THAT?
MARK, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR PRICE POINT.
I THINK THE, UH --
THE MACHINERY'S REMARKABLE.
I MEAN, I LOVE MACHINERY.
I LOVE MECHANICAL STUFF.
HERE'S WHERE IT FELL APART
FOR ME, THOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME
WITH, UH,
MATTRESS SALESPEOPLE.
YOU KNOW, MARK IS RIGHT.
WHENEVER YOU WERE ASKED
A QUESTION,
YOU WENT INTO, UH...
SALES MODE.
...COLORING IT.
AND YOU WENT
INTO SALES MODE.
I LIKE THE SIZZLE,
BUT I WANT TO GET
RIGHT INTO THE STEAK,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WORKED
AT NASA AS AN ENGINEER.
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,
SOMEBODY TURNED YOU.
I THINK I WANTED MORE.
I DIDN'T GET MORE.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
LORI, CAN I ASK YOU,
UM, WHAT YOUR OBJECTION WAS?
WAS IT THAT I DIDN'T GET
TO YOUR QUESTION FAST ENOUGH,
OR IS IT THE FUNDAMENTALS
OF THE BUSINESS AND THE PRODUCT?
MARK, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER IT.
THEY STARTED TO TALK.
YOU STARTED TO TURN TO THEM.
SO I STARTED TO SHOUT TO YOU
MY QUESTION --
"WHOA! HEY! OVER HERE!
CAN YOU ANSWER THAT?"
YOU TURNED DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.
I SAID,
"HELLO? ANSWER ME."
WELL, LORI, WHY DON'T YOU
GET OVER IT 'CAUSE --
WAIT, WAIT.
NO, I'M NOT GONNA GET OVER IT.
IF YOU VALUED ME,
YOU WOULD'VE ANSWERED BACK
MY QUESTIONS.
SEND HER A LOVE LETTER.
AND YOU WOULD'VE SAID,
"I'LL ANSWER YOU GUYS
IN A MINUTE."
BARBARA, KNOCK IT OFF.
I THINK SHE'S --
SHE'S MAKING A GOOD POINT.
...IF IT WAS IMPORTANT.
SO I FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT
THE RIGHT PARTNER FOR ME.
I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR THAT, LORI.
Corcoran: BUT, LORI, EVERYONE
WAS SHOUTING HIM AT ONCE.
AND IN FACT,
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT SHARKS FOR THIS.
MARK, ARE YOU STILL HERE?
SO, CAN I GO THROUGH A LIST
OF, UH, RETAILERS?
I THINK WE'RE ALL OUT.
WE'RE ALL OUT, MARK.
YOU HAD YOUR SHOT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
IT'S A TOUGH CROWD IN THERE.
I'M GONNA PROVE KEVIN WRONG.
THIS PRODUCT IS GONNA BE HUGE.
YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT IN RETAILERS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,
AND I'M GONNA BE HAPPY
TO BE THAT BIG DEAL
THAT GOT AWAY FROM THE TANK.
