AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
I DID THE TRADEMARK.
YOU KNOW, I DO CUSTOMER SERVICE.
SO IT'S BEEN ALL
DO-IT-YOURSELF SO FAR.
YEAH, I'M DOING EVERYTHING.
I'M GONNA WAIT TO HEAR
WHAT MARK SAYS.
OKAY.
YOU'RE SITTING BACK,
WAITING IN THE WINGS.
I ALWAYS DO.
SO, HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
I AGREE WITH BARBARA
THAT IT IS A RETAIL PLAY
IN MAJOR VERTICAL CITIES.
BUT I ALSO SEE IT
AS A TECH PLAY,
WHICH IS
THE MOST INTERESTING TO ME.
SO YOU'RE LEAVING
A TON OF MONEY ON THE TABLE,
Feld:
I WENT WITH MARK AND BARBARA
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE BEST TWO
TO HELP ME MAKE
THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS I NEED
WITH THIS COMPANY,
YES AND NO.
YES AND NO.
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, MARK.
THERE'S NOTHING WITH THAT.
BUT, I MEAN, ALL THE PACKAGING.
I MEAN...
WE'D LOVE TO TELL YOU MORE
ABOUT THAT.
I BET YOU WOULD,
SO GO AHEAD.
YES, WE WOULD.
WE CAME UP WITH THIS
BALM CHICKY BALM BALM LABEL
AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT IDEA
FOR THE FRIEND END.
SO THEN, WHAT WE DECIDED WAS
THAT WE WANT TO GO AFTER MASS.
WE THINK THAT IT HAS
VARIOUS LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES
BECAUSE OUR PATENT
NOT ONLY COVERS THIS SHAPE TUBE,
IT COVERS ANY SHAPE TUBE
THAT'S COMPRISED
OF A LIFT DEVICE --
EITHER A TWIST, A PUSH-UP,
OR A LIFT --
WITH A STATIONARY POT
ON THE BOTTOM.
Herjavec: LOVE THE NAME.
HOW MANY ARE YOU SELLING TODAY,
IF YOU'RE SELLING ANY?
WE'VE SOLD, UM,
$17,000 WORTH OF BALM.
SORRY. $17,000?
DOLLARS.
O'Leary: IS THAT ENOUGH
TO KEEP IT IN RETAIL?
'CAUSE YOU SAID
YOU HAD 60 STORES.
YES.
YOU'RE SELLING
.00-NOTHING-BURGER PER STORE.
THE FACTS ARE
WE CREATED IT
JUST TO GET
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN RUNNING.
WE HAVE A MOLD,
WE HAVE THE PATENT ON THE TUBE,
WITH NO MONEY
PUT TOWARDS MARKETING.
$17,000 IN SALES IN THIS MARKET,
IT'S DEPRESSING.
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?
THIS IS $4.50 WHOLESALE
IN A GENERAL MARKET.
FOR A NICHE MARKET,
THAT'S FANTASTIC
IF YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT
IN ADULT STORES.
BUT WE CAN ALSO PUT,
VERY EASILY, A LABEL ON HERE
THAT IT IS INTENDED
FOR THOSE PEOPLE,
GETTING MARKET SHARE
IN THE LIP-BALM SPACE
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
ON THE TOP OF MY LIST.
YOU'RE
SINGLE-CELL-AMOEBA PLAYERS.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN COCKROACHES.
Herjavec: KEVIN, I'M NOT CLEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
ARE YOU IN,
OR ARE YOU OUT?
I'M SAYING
IT'S A BAD WASTE OF TIME...
I THINK I HAVE A GUESS.
IT'S NOT YOUR PRIMARY FOCUS.
MARK...
DON'T GO OUT.
THERE'S OTHER -- I MEAN,
THERE'S A BATHTUB VERSION
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.
IT'S NOT JUST A PRODUCT.
THE MOST DIFFICULT
ENTREPRENEURS TO WORK WITH
ARE INVENTORS
BECAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED
ON INVENTING,
AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING
COMPANIES.
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT PURSUING
ANYTHING ELSE
UNTIL I GET THIS THING --
YOU'VE GOT A --
Y-YOU'RE THE NUMBER 10 REALTOR
IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON.
MM-HMM.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WORKING HARD?
LOOK, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
IF THIS GOT TO THAT POINT
WHERE IT REQUIRED
YOUR FULL-TIME USE,
I'M JUST MAKING THE ASSUMPTION
YOU WOULD DO IT FULL TIME.
YEAH.
THIS IS 100% MY PASSION.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
THAT PATH.
RIGHT.
IF YOU DECIDE --
BECAUSE YOU CONTROL IT --
THAT YOU TAKE
THE LICENSE DEAL,
GREAT MARKETERS,
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MARK ARAMLI.
MARK, HOW MUCH NOISE
DOES IT MAKE?
IT'S QUIETER
THAN ANY FAN.
IT'S QUIETER
THAN ANY ROOM AIR CONDITIONER.
OH! I'M GETTING IN BED
WITH MARK.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S ABOUT
THE SAME LEVEL...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT?"
...OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD
HVAC REGISTER.
MOVE OVER, BUDDY.
WOW. IS THAT A WATER MATTRESS
YOU HAVE THERE?
NO.
UH, WE ARE JUST SENDING AIR
INTO THE BED
SO IT GIVES US
A LITTLE PUFFING.
WAIT.
THERE'S MORE.
50% OF COUPLES HAVE DIFFERENT
SLEEP-TEMPERATURE PREFERENCES.
HE LIKES IT HOT,
SHE LIKES IT COOL.
THERE'S ALWAYS A FIGHT
OVER THE THERMOSTAT.
THE BEDJET
HAS DUAL-ZONE CAPABILITY.
WHAT'S IT LIKE, LORI?
MY -- MY SIDE IS HOT.
I FEEL HOT AIR. RIGHT?
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S COOL.
I MEAN,
IT FEELS GOOD ON MY FEET.
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
HOW DO YOU HOOK IT UP?
WE HAVE A NOZZLE HERE.
IF WE'RE GONNA DO DUAL ZONE,
WE PLUG IT INTO THIS.
SO, LIKE, THERE'S
A SPECIAL SHEET, RIGHT?
SO YOU PUT A SPECIAL SHEET THERE
THAT HAS THE HOLE AT THE BOTTOM?
ONLY FOR DUAL ZONE.
IF IT'S SINGLE ZONE,
RIGHT, JUST ONE --
SINGLE ZONE,
WE JUST HAVE THIS LITTLE GUY,
PROVE TO ME
THE MARKET CARES.
YEAH, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE ECONOMICS.
GIVE US YOUR SALES.
OKAY, WE ARE GOING
INTO PRODUCTION IN SIX WEEKS.
OH, THERE ARE NO SALES.
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS?
I USED TO BE AN ENGINEER
ON THE NASA SPACE-SUIT PROGRAM.
MARKET TEST
THAT WE DID VIA KICKSTARTER.
WE SOLD MORE THAN $50,000
WORTH OF PRODUCT.
WHAT WAS THE, UM,
PRICE PER UNIT?
UH, THE RETAIL PRICE FOR THIS
IS GONNA BE $499.
O'Leary: OHH!
WOW!
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN A MATTRESS.
HOUSTON, WE GOT A PROBLEM.
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED
SINCE WE STARTED SELLING,
OKAY?
OKAY.
WE HAD OUR FIRST TRADE SHOW
IN LAS VEGAS,
WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
TRADE SHOWS
TO PUT INTO THE MARKET
FROM MATTRESS FIRM."
MARK, THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.
THESE ARE THE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS, OKAY?
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHEN THE CONSUMER
WALKS UP TO THAT MACHINE
INTO THE MARKET.
NAME THE NAME.
SIT 'N SLEEP.
YOU WILL NEVER SELL THIS DEVICE
FOR $499.
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
WHY DON'T WE HEAR...
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.
...WHAT THOSE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS SAID?
MR. WONDERFUL --
NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.
THE DEVIL HIMSELF
WON'T PAY YOU FOR THAT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ORDERS
AT THAT PRICE POINT?
WE HAVE A P.O.
FOR $1.1 MILLION.
REALLY?
FROM WHO?
THAT CAME IN, UH,
JUST LAST WEEK, OKAY?
THIS IS THE LARGEST
MATTRESS MANUFACTURER
MARK, YOU HAD MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS.
THAT, TO ME,
IS THE BIGGER KAHUNA.
WHY?
NO, IT ISN'T.
MARK, WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU
THEY WANTED TO DO?
DID THEY SAY,
"WE WANT TO HAVE MEETINGS
WITH YOU LATER"?
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THEM
TALKING TO YOU?
THE MARKET'S SO BIG.
MY COST OF GOODS SOLD...
I WANT TO BACK
TO WHAT I ASKED YOU.
MARK, MARK, IGNORE HIM.
...IS AT 1,000 UNITS PER LOT.
MARK, IGNORE HIM.
YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL.
YOU'VE OVERPRICED IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PIG.
QUIET!
OHH. OY VEY.
WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING
ABOUT WHAT THE MATTRESS
MANUFACTURERS --
MARK,
I HAVE A SIMPLE QUESTION.
MARK, IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME,
I'M GOING OUT.
WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS PRODUCT?
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.
I'M OUT.
MARK, IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME,
I'M GOING OUT.
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.
I'M OUT.
'CAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN SELL ANY.
NO, I ASKED HIM FIVE TIMES
TO ANSWER MY QUESTION,
WE BELIEVE MARKET ENTRY FOR THIS
IS AN ASSISTED SALE.
IT NEEDS TO BE SOLD
WHERE PEOPLE BUY MATTRESSES,
SO THERE IS A PREMIUM MARKET
OUT THERE THAT IS MASSIVE.
Cuban: MARK, I THINK
IT'S A COOL PRODUCT, RIGHT?
WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
IS THAT,
WHEN I ASKED
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY,
YOU KEPT ON SELLING.
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE VIBE.
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ALL
THE PIECES YET TO GO FORWARD,
MARK,
YOU MENTIONED, CLEARLY,
THAT THIS IS INTENDED TARGETED
TO THE PREMIUM-MATTRESS BUYER.
BEYOND PREMIUM.
THAT 25% --
BUT THAT'S YOUR SWEET SPOT,
RIGHT?
HERE'S MY OBJECTION TO IT.
MOST OF THE PREMIUM BUYERS TODAY
ARE NOT BUYING THIS STYLE BED.
THE UPHOLSTERED BED
THAT ALMOST HITS THE FLOOR
IS THE MOST COMMONLY
SOLD BED TODAY.
MY BED WOULDN'T FIT THAT
UNDER THERE
BECAUSE I HAVE
A LOVELY UPHOLSTERED BED.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA SELL WELL HERE.
I WISH I BELIEVED YOU,
BUT I DON'T. I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
I SEE CATASTROPHE.
I SEE DISASTER.
I SEE BLACK CLOUDS,
DEVASTATION, TOTAL COLLAPSE.
HERE'S WHAT
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE.
YOU'RE GONNA SHIP OUT
A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS
WORTH OF INVENTORY,
MARK, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR PRICE POINT.
I THINK THE, UH --
THE MACHINERY'S REMARKABLE.
I MEAN, I LOVE MACHINERY.
I LOVE MECHANICAL STUFF.
HERE'S WHERE IT FELL APART
FOR ME, THOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME
WITH, UH,
MATTRESS SALESPEOPLE.
YOU KNOW, MARK IS RIGHT.
WHENEVER YOU WERE ASKED
A QUESTION,
YOU WENT INTO, UH...
SALES MODE.
...COLORING IT.
MARK, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER IT.
THEY STARTED TO TALK.
YOU STARTED TO TURN TO THEM.
SO I STARTED TO SHOUT TO YOU
MY QUESTION --
"WHOA! HEY! OVER HERE!
CAN YOU ANSWER THAT?"
YOU TURNED DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.
I SAID,
"HELLO? ANSWER ME."
WELL, LORI, WHY DON'T YOU
GET OVER IT 'CAUSE --
WAIT, WAIT.
NO, I'M NOT GONNA GET OVER IT.
IF YOU VALUED ME,
YOU WOULD'VE ANSWERED BACK
MY QUESTIONS.
YOU WERE ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT SHARKS FOR THIS.
MARK, ARE YOU STILL HERE?
SO, CAN I GO THROUGH A LIST
OF, UH, RETAILERS?
I THINK WE'RE ALL OUT.
WE'RE ALL OUT, MARK.
YOU HAD YOUR SHOT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
IT'S A TOUGH CROWD IN THERE.
I'M GONNA PROVE KEVIN WRONG.
THIS PRODUCT IS GONNA BE HUGE.
YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT IN RETAILERS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,
