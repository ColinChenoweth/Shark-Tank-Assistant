KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.
BUT THEY'RE NOT WORTH
$8 MILLION TO ME, KEVIN.
I DIDN'T --
I AGREE. SO HANG ON.
HANG ON, ROBERT.
I THINK THEY'RE WORTH
$6 MILLION.
LET ME WORK
SOMETHING HERE.
HERE'S THE THING --
IT'S NOT ONLY
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
YOU WANT TO HEAR AN OFFER,
OR YOU WANT TO TALK?
ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE WORTH $15 MILLION,
Herjavec: KEVIN, I LIKE
YOUR DEAL, BUT 5% ISN'T ENOUGH.
[ LAUGHS ]
KEVIN!
YOU GUYS
ARE BRIGHT WOMEN,
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S KEVIN WALTERMIRE.
I'M HERE TO ASK $50,000
FOR A 15% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY, BeverageBoy.
ENVISION A SCENARIO
WE'VE ALL SEEN BEFORE --
A GUY ENJOYING HIMSELF,
RELAXING IN A POOL,
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE --
UNTIL HE GETS DISTRACTED...
OH!
KEVIN, CAN WE SEE THEM?
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU
SOME SAMPLES.
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME,
KEVIN?
UH, THE LAST SIX MONTHS.
O'Leary: SO, KEVIN...
[ LAUGHTER ]
...THE TASTEVIN
IS A DEVICE
THAT'S USED TO SIP
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WINE
FROM THE BURGUNDY REGION
OF FRANCE.
I'M GLAD
YOU MENTIONED THAT.
KEVIN, THAT'S WHERE
I'M GOING.
HAVE YOU DONE TRADE SHOWS?
YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN?
ANYBODY WHO REFUSES
TO TAKE AN ORDER FORM
TO A TRADE SHOW...
I'M OUT.
WHOA!
HOW COULD YOU NOT TAKE
AN ORDER --
THAT'S NOT LIKE NOT HAVING A PEN
WHEN YOU GO TO CLOSE THE DEAL.
YOU KNOW, WE SEE
ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS.
O'Leary: I THINK
YOU'RE SEEING ONE RIGHT NOW.
I N--
I NEVER JUDGE THINGS.
I DO.
THEY'RE -- THEY'RE POO-POO
ON A STICK YOU GIVE AWAY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF
PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
ALL RIGHT, KEVIN,
I'VE BEEN LISTENING,
YOUR NAME IS KEVIN,
MY NAME IS KEVIN --
I'M OFFICIALLY STRIPPING YOU
OF YOUR NAME
BECAUSE THIS IDEA
IS SO BAD.
IT IS SO GOOD.
IT IS SO BAD.
IT IS SO GOOD.
YOU DO NOT DESERVE
THE NAME KEVIN.
YOU ARE NOW CALLED "ZONK."
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M SORRY, MAN. I AM OUT.
THIS SUCKS.
BY THE WAY, ZONK,
IF YOU DON'T GET A DEAL,
YOU'RE LEAVING
WITH THE ZONK NAME.
I'M NOT LEAVING WITH THE NAME,
BUT THANK YOU.
LOOK, KEVIN,
THE ONLY THING THAT'S MISSING
FROM YOUR ENTIRE PRESENTATION
IS YOU COME OUT,
Waltermire:
I THINK IT IS.
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS,
I'M THINKING
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,
I'M THINKING TARGET,
WALMART --
THOSE KIND OF PLACES.
NOPE, NOT ME. QVC.
DAYMOND, YOU THINK THAT THIS
COULD WORK FOR PROMOTIONS?
John: I'M KILLING IT
WITH THE 180 CUP.
THAT'S THE ONE YOU TAKE
THE SHOT OUT OF THE BOTTOM --
THE -- THE RED CUP.
IT'S IN PARTY CITY.
IT MATCHES
WHAT I'M ALREADY DOING,
KEVIN, I'LL GIVE YOU A MILLION
TO ORDER FROM WALMART.
KEVIN, KEVIN, I'M NOT GIVING YOU
A CONTINGENCY, RIGHT?
I HAVE A LICENSING FIRM.
I HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE.
THAT WILL NOT BE YOUR PROBLEM,
ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
KEVIN! WELCOME BACK!
I LIKE ZONK BETTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DO LIKE ZONK
BETTER, THOUGH.
Greiner:
CONGRATS, DAYMOND.
CALL IT THE ZONK-A-TRON.
I'LL CHARGE YOU A ROYALTY.
IT'S CALLED THE BevBoy.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE TIME.
IT'S BEEN FUN.
Greiner: CONGRATS.
THANKS, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
TAKE THE CHAIR GUY
WITH YOU.
HE'S FOR YOU.
EVERYBODY,
CLOSE THEIR EYES.
OHH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, NASTY!
THANK YOU GUYS.
CONGRATS.
Herjavec:
WOW. DAYMOND.
I JUST WANTED TO
STICK IT TO YOU.
WELL...
BUT I DO LIKE IT.
I HAD TO FIGHT
FOR THAT ONE.
Waltermire:
I JUST WALKED OUT OF THE TANK.
I JUST GOT A DEAL.
GUESS WHO'S PARTYING TONIGHT.
[ CHUGGING ]
I WILL SHOW THIS
TO THE CONFRÈRIE
AT OUR NEXT
CHAPTER MEETING.
NO QUESTION.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A PRODUCT
DESIGNED TO MAKE EATING FUN.
[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ]
HELLO, SHARKS.
KEVIN, WHAT IS THAT?
CHEESE?
NO, I'M DOING A, UH, CAKE
THAT I MADE EARLIER, PREVIOUSLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OHH, MAN! HOW DID YOUR KIDS
TURN OUT NORMAL, KEVIN?
SO YOU'RE SAYING
'CAUSE THEY'RE SO STARVING,
THEY'RE JUST GONNA EAT
WHATEVER'S SITTING THERE?
THEY'LL EAT IT.
