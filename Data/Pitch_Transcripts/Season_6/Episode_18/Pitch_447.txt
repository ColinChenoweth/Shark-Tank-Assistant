KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,
FOUNDED ONE OF
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
BUT THEY'RE NOT WORTH
$8 MILLION TO ME, KEVIN.
I DIDN'T --
I AGREE. SO HANG ON.
HANG ON, ROBERT.
I THINK THEY'RE WORTH
$6 MILLION.
LET ME WORK
SOMETHING HERE.
HERE'S THE THING --
IT'S NOT ONLY
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
YOU WANT TO HEAR AN OFFER,
OR YOU WANT TO TALK?
ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE WORTH $15 MILLION,
AND I THINK ALL THE SHARKS
ARE IN THE SAME BOAT ON THAT,
BUT I LIKE THE FACT
THAT IT HAS SALES.
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
TAKE OUR CASH
OUT OF THE BUSINESS.
NO BANK'S
GONNA LET YOU DO IT.
I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND
THE $750,000
TOWARDS BUILDING CAPACITY,
SO I'M GONNA LEND YOU
$750,000 AT 10%.
IT'LL BE OUT THERE
FOR 36 MONTHS -- 3 YEARS --
AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
5% EQUITY
BECAUSE YOU WANT A SHARK
ON YOUR TEAM.
SO, THIS IS CALLED
VENTURE DEBT.
YOUR COMPANY
IS IDEAL FOR IT
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO AGREE
ON VALUATION, ALL RIGHT?
Herjavec: KEVIN, I LIKE
YOUR DEAL, BUT 5% ISN'T ENOUGH.
CAN I COME IN WITH YOU,
AND WE GET 10%?
DONE.
OKAY.
YOU GET TWO SHARKS.
IF YOUR OFFER STANDS,
CAN WE GO BACK
AND TALK AND COME BACK
REALLY QUICK?
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE CARPET.
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
IT'S NOT THE CASH HERE --
WE WANT THE RELATIONSHIP,
BUT THE EQUITY IS TOO HIGH --
10% WITH NO MONEY.
PUT $250,000, YOU MAKE 10%
ON YOUR MONEY FOR 36 MONTHS.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
36 MONTHS --
Greiner:
AND THEN 5% EQUITY.
AND THEN THAT'S --
10%, 10%.
10% EQUITY.
NO, NO,
WE NEED 5% EACH.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT --
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
OH, THAT WOULD BE 15--
BECAUSE THEY LEFT THE TANK,
THEY GOT SCREWED.
WELCOME BACK, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
SO, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE TANK
WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE CARPET
IS THE WATERS SWIRL.
YOU KNOW.
YOU'VE SEEN THE SHOW.
LORI EXPRESSED INTEREST
IN IT.
THAT MEANS
YOU GET 3 SHARKS,
AND NOW WE'RE ASKING
FOR 15% EQUITY.
WHEN YOU HAVE THREE SHARKS
IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS,
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
CAN HAPPEN.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A SHERPA
WHEN YOU'RE IN BUSINESS, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHS ]
THEY DEFINITELY WILL.
YOU GOT THREE SHERPAS!
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
KEVIN, LORI, AND ROBERT
HAVE ONE OFFER ON THE TABLE --
$750,000 AS A LOAN
FOR 15% EQUITY OF THE HIMALAYAN
DOG CHEW COMPANY.
WHEN YOU HAVE THREE SHARKS
IN A COMPANY LIKE THIS,
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS
CAN HAPPEN.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
[ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ]
YEAH, WE HAVE TO HUMBLY --
HUMBLY DECLINE THAT.
Greiner: WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
WITH THE DEAL?
YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT IT'S A DEBT DEAL?
EXACTLY. WE -- WE HAVE A MILLION
DOLLARS IN LINE OF CREDIT,
WHICH IS, UH -- WE HAVE --
WE DON'T EVEN USE IT.
SO WHY DON'T YOU ASK US
TO LOWER THE INTEREST RATE?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY DON'T NEED IT.
MARK, WHY ARE YOU MAKING
NOISE OVER THERE?
WHY WOULD THEY GIVE UP EQUITY
WHEN THEY GET THE LOAN FOR FREE?
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
SEE THEM BE STUPID.
COME ON! YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO
GIVE THEM A DIME!
GOSH.
CAN WE DO $750,000
FOR 10%?
BUT IS IT DEBT,
OR IS IT EQUITY?
STRAIGHT EQUITY.
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THAT DEAL.
YEAH, I WANT TO DO
THE DEBT, GUYS.
THEY CUT THEIR VALUATION
IN HALF, GUYS.
HEY, IT'S -- I'M NOT --
MARK, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
GET BACK IN?
THEY WENT FROM 5% TO 10%.
WHY DON'T YOU DO
THAT DEAL?
I'M JUST ARBITRATING --
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE
ARGUING ABOUT SEMANTICS.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
BUT AT THIS POINT,
IT'S NOT USEFUL.
YEAH, WE'VE ALREADY
CUT DOWN OUR VALUATION,
LIKE WHAT MARK SAID,
TO HALF OF IT.
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR VALUE
IS WHEN YOU'RE GETTING DEBT.
W-WE CAN GIVE YOU A --
WE CAN DO A-A BIGGER PERCENTAGE
OF EQUITY FOR MORE MONEY --
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE
MAYBE 20% FOR $1.5 MILLION?
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
I WENT IN
BECAUSE KEVIN AND ROBERT
CONVINCED ME
WITH THE ORIGINAL OFFER.
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE COUNTER,
SO I'M OUT.
IF I HAD ANY INTEREST IN BEING
IN THE DOG-CHEW BUSINESS,
YOU'RE MAKING A GOOD OFFER.
MARK, IF IT'S SO GREAT,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT?
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE DOG-CHEW BUSINESS.
THIS IS
SO FRUSTRATING.
YOU GUYS ARE BEING CRAZY.
MARK'S BECOMING LIKE
THE NARRATOR OF THE SHARK TANK.
WE HAD A LOT OF NOISE
OUT OF MR. CUBAN.
HE'S GOOD AT MAKING NOISE, BUT
HE WOULDN'T WRITE YOU A CHECK.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
YES, FOR THE EQUITY.
UH, NO FOR THE LOAN.
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US
ARE INTERESTED, ARE WE?
AW. I'M OUT.
I'LL DO THE $750,000
ON MY OWN FOR 15%.
THAT'S ONE-THIRD
OF WHAT...
[ SCOFFS ]
THAT'S ALMOST LIKE ONE-THIRD
OF WHAT --
YOU WANTED
A STRAIGHT EQUITY DEAL.
[ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ]
WELL, THE TEAM SAYS NO
TO THAT DEAL, ROBERT.
I'M OUT.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
NAMASTE.
NAMASTE.
NAMASTE.
WELL, WE TRIED.
WE USED...
IT'S TOO MUCH.
BY THE TIME THEY GOT
TO THE LAST OFFER,
THAT WAS A GOOD DEAL
FROM THEM.
MARK, YOU KEEP
DOING GOOD DEALS.
I'LL DO SPECTACULAR DEALS.
THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE DIDN'T WANT TO,
UH, DEVALUE OUR COMPANY
THE WAY THE SHARKS
WANTED TO OFFER.
UH, FROM THIS DAY
ON FORWARD,
WE JUST HAVE TO WORK
A LITTLE BIT HARDER --
UM, ACTUALLY HARDER
THAN EVER BEFORE --
AND PROVE TO THE SHARKS THAT WE
WERE CAPABLE OF THAT VALUATION.
Narrator: IN SEASON FOUR,
NEIL, DENNIS, AND PETE
LANDED A DEAL WITH
ROBERT HERJAVEC AND MARK CUBAN
FOR THEIR HIGH-PROTEIN
NUT-BUTTER COMPANY,
NUTS 'N MORE.
ROBERT,
WHAT'S YOUR FEELINGS?
I'LL GO DOWN TO MARK'S 35%.
YOU GUYS GOT A DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
GOT IT.
LET'S SEE
HOW THEY'RE DOING NOW.
Cameron: HA HA!
THERE IT IS.
IN THE TWO YEARS
SINCE WE'VE MADE A DEAL
WITH MARK AND ROBERT,
WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF GROWTH.
Cuban: HEY, GUYS.
HEY, MARK.
WELCOME TO GNC
AND WELCOME TO PITTSBURGH.
THANK YOU.
HEY, IT'S GREAT
TO BE HOME.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
TODAY WE'RE MEETING
WITH MIKE ARCHBOLD,
THE C.E.O. OF GNC,
AND I HAVE A FEELING THERE'S A
BIG ANNOUNCEMENT COMING OUR WAY.
AND HOW'S SALES
BEEN GOING, MIKE?
IT SOLD SO WELL, WE WOUND UP
EXPANDING IT TO 2,000 STORES
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.
WOW.
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT'S AWESOME.
Iannotti: OVER THE PAST YEAR,
WE'VE DONE VERY WELL
WITH OUR PEANUT
PROTEIN SPREADS.
NOW WE'RE EXPANDING
INTO OUR ALMOND WHEY-INFUSED
PROTEIN POWDER.
AS PART OF OUR COMMITMENT
TO NUTS 'N MORE,
WE'RE PREPARED TO ROLL IT OUT
WITH 4,000 STORES
ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY,
IN EVER SINGLE GNC STORE.
THAT'S AMAZING.
WOW!
MAN, THANK YOU, MIKE.
THAT'S AWESOME.
Cameron: WHEN WE PITCHED,
WE ONLY HAD $100,000 IN SALES.
JUST TWO YEARS
AFTER MAKING THE DEAL,
WE HAVE $6 MILLION
IN SALES.
NOW, WITH THIS EXPANSION
WITH GNC,
WE THINK OUR SALES
CAN REACH $20 MILLION.
AND WE'RE GONNA
DRINK TO IT, TOO.
LET'S DRINK TO THAT.
OH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND YOU PUT MY FAVORITE VODKA
IN HERE, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WORKING WITH MARK AND ROBERT
HAS BEEN AMAZING.
THEY'VE OPENED UP DOORS
WE NEVER THOUGHT IMAGINABLE.
Cuban: GOOD JOB, GUYS.
WE'RE JUST THREE NORMAL GUYS
FROM RHODE ISLAND WITH A DREAM,
AND THIS GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY
TO REALLY MAKE IT COME TRUE.
Narrator:
NEXT UP ARE ENTREPRENEURS
WHO BELIEVE A WOMAN'S MAKEUP
SHOULD MAKE A BOLD STATEMENT.
[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ]
HI.
HI.
[ LAUGHS ]
KEVIN!
YOU GUYS
ARE BRIGHT WOMEN,
AND YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
VERY INDUSTRIOUS.
BUT BEING A WOMAN,
ONE OF THE HARD THINGS FOR ME
WITH COSMETICS
AND SHOPPING ONLINE
IS IT'S SO HARD FOR THE STORE
ONLINE TO CONVEY TO ME
WHAT THAT COLOR IS
REALLY GONNA TURN OUT LIKE
WHEN I GET IT HOME.
YOU'RE SAYING WOMEN WANT TO
SEE IT AND TOUCH IT.
WELL, IT'S JUST HARD TO
TRANSLATE IT, YOU KNOW?
LIKE, YOU LOOK,
AND YOU SEE A CERTAIN PINK,
AND THEN IT C-- YOU KNOW,
YOUR SCREEN IS BRIGHTER
OR YOUR SCREEN
IS LESS BRIGHT.
YOU KNOW, IT NEVER COMES
ACROSS THE EXACT WAY.
OH.
SO WHEN YOU GET IT HOME,
IT'S A GUESSING GAME.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S KEVIN WALTERMIRE.
I'M HERE TO ASK $50,000
FOR A 15% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY, BeverageBoy.
ENVISION A SCENARIO
WE'VE ALL SEEN BEFORE --
A GUY ENJOYING HIMSELF,
RELAXING IN A POOL,
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE --
UNTIL HE GETS DISTRACTED...
OH!
...AND SPILLS HIS --
OH, NO!
STOP THE MADNESS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND SPILLS HIS DRINK
ALL OVER HIMSELF,
JUST RUINING HIS DAY.
THANKFULLY, THE BevBoy IS HERE
TO SAVE THE DAY.
THANK GOODNESS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE BevBoy WILL MIRACULOUSLY
FLOAT IN WATER WITHOUT SPILLING.
THINK OF IT AS YOUR VERY OWN
PERSONAL FLOATING SIDEKICK.
PEOPLE WILL TAKE NOTICE
THAT YOU'RE DIFFERENT
AT THE POOL PARTY.
YOU TAKE THINGS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
IF THEIR MOTTO
IS "WORK HARD, PLAY HARD,"
YOUR MOTTO IS
"WORK HARD, PLAY HARDER."
BOO-YAH.
BOO-YAH.
HELP ME SAVE THE DAY.
INVEST IN BeverageBoy
AND FLOAT WITH ME.
KEVIN, CAN WE SEE THEM?
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU
SOME SAMPLES.
AND CAN LORI GET IN THE HOT TUB
WITH YOUR FRIEND?
OF COURSE.
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.
IT'S A PARTY.
GO, LORI.
AND I'LL EXPLAIN
HOW IT WORKS TO YOU.
THE WEIGHTED EXTENSION GIVES IT
A CENTER OF GRAVITY,
SO NO MATTER IF IT BOBS
LEFT OR RIGHT
OR IF IT RIDES OVER A WAVE,
IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO CENTER.
Greiner:
PRETTY GOOD IDEA.
THAT'S THE PHYSICS OF IT.
DID YOU CREATE
THIS YOURSELF?
PRETTY COOL.
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS ACTUALLY
A GREAT COLLEGE POOL PARTY.
WE'RE ALL HANGING OUT,
AND A FRIEND OF OURS
FELL OFF OF A RAFT.
AND I JUST HAD A MOMENT
AND WAS LIKE, "LOOK,
IF WE HAVE RAFTS, WHY DON'T
OUR DRINKS HAVE RAFTS?"
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT?
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
I'VE SOLD, UH, 2,500 UNITS,
SO ABOUT $10,500 IN REVENUE.
AND I'M IN STORES
FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO TEXAS.
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME,
KEVIN?
UH, THE LAST SIX MONTHS.
OH, YOU --
THIS IS BRAND-NEW.
YES.
IS THIS LIKE THE MODERN-DAY'S
MAN VERSION OF A TASTEVIN?
[ Laughing ] TASTEVIN!
Herjavec: A WHAT?
INTERESTING, DAYMOND.
THE CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN.
LOOK AT THIS.
OH, MY GOD.
THEY MAY LITIGATE.
HE'S GOING,
"WHAT IS THAT?"
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT IS.
O'Leary: SO, KEVIN...
[ LAUGHTER ]
...THE TASTEVIN
IS A DEVICE
THAT'S USED TO SIP
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WINE
FROM THE BURGUNDY REGION
OF FRANCE.
I'M GLAD
YOU MENTIONED THAT.
"OH, BUT THERE'S MORE."
I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR WINE,
SO WE'LL POUR YOU
ONE OF YOUR --
MAYBE A FINE BORDEAUX
FOR YOU.
YEAH.
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA
DROP IT IN WATER,
AND NOW YOU CAN PARTY,
TOO, MR. WONDERFUL.
LOOK AT THAT.
I WILL TELL THE CONFRÈRIE.
[ LAUGHS ]
Greiner:
SO, WHAT DOES THIS COST,
AND WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE?
IT COSTS ME ABOUT $2.
I WHOLESALE IT AT $5.
MY RETAILERS RETAIL IT
AT $9.99.
WHY AREN'T THE COLLEGE PEOPLE
ON BOARD WITH THIS?
WHY ISN'T IT TAKING OFF
A LITTLE BIT MORE?
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY THINK
IT'S MY FAILURE
TO GET IT OUT
IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
KEVIN, THAT'S WHERE
I'M GOING.
HAVE YOU DONE TRADE SHOWS?
I HAVE.
AND -- AND
SO WHAT HAPPENED?
I WENT TO THE, UH,
PROMOTIONAL-PRODUCTS SHOW
IN CHICAGO
A FEW MONTHS AGO --
SOLD OUT OF EVERY UNIT
I TOOK THERE.
YEAH, BUT DID YOU -- DID YOU
GET ANY ORDERS IN STORES?
SO WHAT STORES
GAVE YOU ORDERS?
ACTUALLY, SO, I DIDN'T BRING
ANY ORDER FORMS TO THOSE SHOWS.
IT WAS JUST AN EXCHANGE
OF INFORMATION.
HOW COULD YOU NOT BRING
AN ORDER FORM TO A TRADE SHOW?
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
A MENTOR OF MINE TOLD ME
IT WAS MORE ABOUT GETTING
THE PRODUCT OUT THERE.
IT'S A TRADE SHOW.
BUT I TAKE THEIR BUSINESS
INFORMATION --
YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN?
ANYBODY WHO REFUSES
TO TAKE AN ORDER FORM
TO A TRADE SHOW...
I'M OUT.
WHOA!
HOW COULD YOU NOT TAKE
AN ORDER --
THAT'S NOT LIKE NOT HAVING A PEN
WHEN YOU GO TO CLOSE THE DEAL.
YOU KNOW, WE SEE
ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS.
O'Leary: I THINK
YOU'RE SEEING ONE RIGHT NOW.
I N--
I NEVER JUDGE THINGS.
I DO.
THEY'RE -- THEY'RE POO-POO
ON A STICK YOU GIVE AWAY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF
PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
AND HAVE DROPPED THEIR CAN,
THEIR CUP IN THE WATER?
AND I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU LAUGH AT,
AND YOU THINK IT'S POO-POO,
BUT WHEN YOU WATCH IT,
IT WORKS,
AND IT'S HILARIOUS.
PEOPLE ENJOY USING IT.
ALL RIGHT, KEVIN,
I'VE BEEN LISTENING,
I'VE BEEN LISTENING,
AND NOW I'M SAYING THIS --
YOUR NAME IS KEVIN,
MY NAME IS KEVIN --
I'M OFFICIALLY STRIPPING YOU
OF YOUR NAME
BECAUSE THIS IDEA
IS SO BAD.
IT IS SO GOOD.
IT IS SO BAD.
IT IS SO GOOD.
YOU DO NOT DESERVE
THE NAME KEVIN.
YOU ARE NOW CALLED "ZONK."
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M SORRY, MAN. I AM OUT.
THIS SUCKS.
BY THE WAY, ZONK,
IF YOU DON'T GET A DEAL,
YOU'RE LEAVING
WITH THE ZONK NAME.
I'M NOT LEAVING WITH THE NAME,
BUT THANK YOU.
LOOK, KEVIN,
THE ONLY THING THAT'S MISSING
FROM YOUR ENTIRE PRESENTATION
IS YOU COME OUT,
WE ALL LAUGH AT YOU,
AND THEN YOU SAY,
"BUT I HAVE HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES,"
AND WE ALL GO, "WOW!"
AND THEN YOU GET A DEAL.
I JUST STARTED.
FOR SOME REASON,
IT'S NOT FLYING OFF THE SHELF.
I'M OUT.
OKAY, ZONK,
THERE'S ONLY TWO SHARKS LEFT.
LORI, ARE YOU
GONNA SAVE HIM?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO JUDGE
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WANT A FLOATING BEER HOLDER.
ZONK-A-TRON.
A ZONK-A-TRON.
I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS A BevBoy,
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
WITH YOUR CAPABILITIES,
LORI,
IF YOU PUT THIS ON QVC
AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY SEE IT,
PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT.
LORI, IS THERE
A QVC CUSTOMER --
I DON'T KNOW --
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
A BETTER QVC PRODUCT.
I DON'T THINK
THAT THIS IS A QVC.
Waltermire:
I THINK IT IS.
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS,
I'M THINKING
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,
I'M THINKING TARGET,
WALMART --
THOSE KIND OF PLACES.
NOPE, NOT ME. QVC.
DAYMOND, YOU THINK THAT THIS
COULD WORK FOR PROMOTIONS?
John: I'M KILLING IT
WITH THE 180 CUP.
THAT'S THE ONE YOU TAKE
THE SHOT OUT OF THE BOTTOM --
THE -- THE RED CUP.
IT'S IN PARTY CITY.
IT MATCHES
WHAT I'M ALREADY DOING,
AND I HAVE
A PROMOTIONAL COMPANY.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
WHOA.
SO, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SALES,
BASICALLY -- VERY LITTLE SALES.
BUT I WILL OFFER YOU
THE $50,000 --
40%.
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO DRIVE THIS WHOLE THING.
ZONK, YOU GOT TO TAKE
THE DEAL.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER.
DAYMOND, ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN TALKING?
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec:
ZONK IS ON A MISSION!
ZONK! YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE
WITH THAT NAME!
I LOVE BOTH --
I LOVE BOTH OF THESE GUYS.
I'LL GO $50,000 FOR 40%,
JUST TO STICK IT TO LORI.
I GOT TO GET TO WORK
ON THIS AND --
BUT I HAVE THE MATCHING PRODUCT,
AND I'M ALREADY SELLING IT.
YOU HAVE THE MATCHING PRODUCT.
YOU HAVE ME. I'LL PEDDLE IT.
THE INTEREST IS THERE.
DO SOMETHING, MAN!
I'M WILLING TO GO TO 30%
IF ONE OF YOU GUYS
CAN MEET ME AT 30%.
ONE OF YOU PUT ZONK
OUT OF HIS PAIN.
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE
THAT, WHEN THEY SEE
THIS PRODUCT, THEY GO NUTS.
IT'S FUNNY.
IT'S NOT POO-POO.
LORI.
IT'S POO-POO ON A STICK.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S POO-POO ON A STICK.
I AM NOT LISTENING TO KEVIN,
AND I'M NOT CALLING YOU ZONK.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $50,000,
30%, CONTINGENT ON THAT I GET
EITHER BED BATH &amp; BEYOND
OR WALMART OR TARGET --
ONE OF THOSE --
TO GIVE ME
A PURCHASE ORDER.
KEVIN, I'LL GIVE YOU A MILLION
TO ORDER FROM WALMART.
KEVIN, KEVIN, I'M NOT GIVING YOU
A CONTINGENCY, RIGHT?
I HAVE A LICENSING FIRM.
I HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE.
THAT WILL NOT BE YOUR PROBLEM,
ALL RIGHT?
AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE TO GO
AND GET LICENSES,
A LOT OF MY PERCENTAGE
GETS CHEWED DOWN,
SO I HAVE TO STAY AT THAT.
CAN YOU MEET ME AT 35%?
I'LL DO THIS RIGHT NOW.
DONE.
DONE.
ALL RIGHT.
KEVIN! WELCOME BACK!
I LIKE ZONK BETTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DO LIKE ZONK
BETTER, THOUGH.
Greiner:
CONGRATS, DAYMOND.
CALL IT THE ZONK-A-TRON.
I'LL CHARGE YOU A ROYALTY.
IT'S CALLED THE BevBoy.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE TIME.
IT'S BEEN FUN.
Greiner: CONGRATS.
THANKS, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
TAKE THE CHAIR GUY
WITH YOU.
HE'S FOR YOU.
EVERYBODY,
CLOSE THEIR EYES.
OHH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, NASTY!
THANK YOU GUYS.
CONGRATS.
Herjavec:
WOW. DAYMOND.
I JUST WANTED TO
STICK IT TO YOU.
WELL...
BUT I DO LIKE IT.
I HAD TO FIGHT
FOR THAT ONE.
Waltermire:
I JUST WALKED OUT OF THE TANK.
I JUST GOT A DEAL.
GUESS WHO'S PARTYING TONIGHT.
[ CHUGGING ]
I WILL SHOW THIS
TO THE CONFRÈRIE
AT OUR NEXT
CHAPTER MEETING.
NO QUESTION.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A PRODUCT
DESIGNED TO MAKE EATING FUN.
[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ]
HELLO, SHARKS.
KEVIN, WHAT IS THAT?
CHEESE?
NO, I'M DOING A, UH, CAKE
THAT I MADE EARLIER, PREVIOUSLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN YOU INSERT
THE POPPER TOP.
OKAY.
AND YOU POP...OUT
THE BITE-SIZE PIECES.
WOW.
THAT'S VERY SIMPLE.
Greiner: SO, HOW MANY
DIFFERENT SHAPES ARE THERE?
SO, WE HAVE, UM, THE SQUARES,
HEARTS, AND TRIANGLES.
I JUST WANT TO SEE IF THIS WORKS
THROUGH THE WAFFLE.
YEAH.
OKAY.
SO, DOWN?
YEP.
ROCK IT, ROCK IT.
THEN YOU ROCK
BACK AND FORTH
FIVE TO SIX TIMES.
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.
I'M SHOWING HER
HOW TO DO IT.
I'M -- [ CHUCKLES ]
I'M NOT DONE YET.
OH, YOU DIDN'T --
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU SCREWED
THAT UP.
OH, LORI!
NO WAY.
ALTHOUGH
THERE'S STILL SOME --
YOU MESSED IT UP.
NO, SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S NOT A CHEF.
SHE'S NOT A CHEF.
OF COURSE.
I'M NOT A CHEF.
OHH, MAN! HOW DID YOUR KIDS
TURN OUT NORMAL, KEVIN?
SO YOU'RE SAYING
'CAUSE THEY'RE SO STARVING,
THEY'RE JUST GONNA EAT
WHATEVER'S SITTING THERE?
THEY'LL EAT IT.
