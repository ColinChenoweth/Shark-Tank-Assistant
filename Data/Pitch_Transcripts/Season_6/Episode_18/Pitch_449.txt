MY NAME IS BOBBIE RHOADS,
FROM WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT.
I AM ASKING FOR $75,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 20% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY, FunBites.
AT FunBites,
WE MAKE FOOD FUN.
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE
OVER 10 MILLION PICKY-EATER KIDS
IN THE U.S. ALONE?
WELL, THE BIG FOOD COMPANIES
HAVE FIGURED OUT
HOW TO ENTICE THESE KIDS
TO EAT THEIR SUGARY,
COLORFUL SNACKS
IN FUN-SHAPED
NOT-SO-HEALTHY NUGGETS.
WELL, THIS MOM SAYS,
"MOVE OVER, JUNK FOOD.
LET'S MAKE HEALTHY FOOD
MORE FUN."
STUDIES SHOW IF YOU ALLOW YOUR
KIDS TO PLAY WITH THEIR FOOD
AND YOU CUT IT
INTO BITE-SIZE FUN SHAPES,
THEY WILL TRY NEW FOODS
AND EAT HEALTHIER.
I HAVE WITH ME SOME SAMPLES
OF FunBites,
AS WELL AS SOME FUN
FOOD CREATIONS FOR YOU.
THANKS, BOBBIE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THIS ONE?
OKAY, GREAT. THANKS.
SPACEMAN!
NICE HOW IT POPS OUT,
THOUGH. LOOK.
NOW, WOULD ANY OF YOU
LIKE TO GIVE FunBites A TRY?
I'LL DO IT. I'M A CHEF.
COME ON UP.
OKAY, BOBBIE,
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
OKAY, SO, FIRST,
STEP ONE, REMOVE THE POPPER TOP
AND PLACE TO THE SIDE.
OKAY.
AND PLACE IT
ON THE FOOD --
FIRMLY BACK AND FORTH
FIVE TO SIX TIMES
TO CUT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH THE FOOD.
O'Leary:
ALL RIGHT, BOBBIE.
YES.
YOU GOT ANY SALES?
YES, UM, SO WE HAVE
ALMOST $400,000 IN SALES
IN UNDER THREE YEARS.
WHAT ABOUT
THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
UM, THE LAST 12 MONTHS --
$150,000.
IN THE -- IN THE LAST, UH,
THREE MONTHS, $40,000.
OKAY, WHERE ARE YOU
SELLING THIS?
UM, SO WE'RE IN
ABOUT 50 WEBSITES,
AND WE JUST APPROVED
TO BE ON TARGET.
I JUST CAME BACK
FROM A TRADE SHOW.
IN FACT, ALL THE WAY
FROM TOYS"R"US TO NORDSTROM
IS INTERESTED IN US.
BUT, BOBBIE, YOU'VE BEEN
AROUND FOR THREE YEARS.
I'M SURE YOU'VE HAD INTEREST
FROM A LOT OF OTHER BIG --
BIG-BOX RETAILERS
IN THE PAST.
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVEN'T GROWN MORE?
WELL, I DID -- I DID ACTUALLY
GET INTO, UH, KOHL'S
AND BED BATH &amp; BEYOND
RIGHT OUT OF THE --
YOU KNOW, THE GATE.
IT WAS LIKE 18 MONTHS IN.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT WAS THE SELL-THROUGH LIKE?
SO, WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
I PULLED TOGETHER A PACKAGE,
AND IT WAS A CLAMSHELL --
YOU KNOW, JUST QUICKLY.
WHEN IT WENT IN STORES,
IT JUST WASN'T SELLING.
CAN WE SEE
YOUR NEW PACKAGING?
YEAH, HERE'S
THE NEW PACKAGING.
YEAH, AND, UH -- AND WHERE
ARE YOU MAKING THIS?
WE MAKE IT IN CONNECTICUT.
AND HOW MUCH
DOES IT COST YOU TO MAKE,
AND WHAT
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
I LIKE THE PACKAGING.
COSTS ME $1.72.
$1.72?
$1.72.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL IT FOR, BOBBIE?
WELL, WHOLESALE IS $6.
RETAIL IS $12.99.
WOW.
GREAT.
GOOD MARGINS.
GO BACK TO THE RETAILS
THAT BROUGHT YOU IN,
THE ONES THAT DIST--
STOPPED SELLING.
ARE THEY GONNA TAKE IT BACK
IN WITH THE NEW PACKAGING?
YEAH.
I JUST GOT THIS PACKAGING
IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS.
UM, KOHL'S LOVES IT.
AND INTERESTING ENOUGH --
THEY HAD US IN THE BABY SECTION.
THEY WANT TO PUT US
IN THE KITCHEN SECTION NOW.
INTERESTING.
SO THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE
YOU BACK IN,
GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE...
RIGHT.
...AND PUT YOU
INTO THAT SECTION.
SO, I'M JUST CURIOUS,
YOU KNOW --
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT?
YEAH.
SO, I JUST GOT
OUR UTILITY PATENT --
FOR CUTTING FOOD
INTO SMALL PIECES?
INTO ANY KIND OF SHAPES.
BOBBIE, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH IT?
SO, I WENT
TO CARNEGIE MELLON
IN PITTSBURGH.
PITTSBURGH.
THEN AFTER THAT,
I WENT AND WORKED FOR REVLON
FOR EIGHT,
UH -- EIGHT YEARS.
I WAS THE YOUNGEST VP
OF MARKETING AT 32 YEARS OLD.
WOW.
I RAN 40% OF THEIR BUSINESS.
WOW.
SO, THEN I DECIDED
TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME OFF
WITH MY KIDS,
AND I HAD SUPER-PICKY EATERS.
AND I REALIZED
THAT IF I MADE THE FOOD FUN
AND CREATED LITTLE SHAPES,
THAT THEY WOULD TRY NEW THINGS
AND EAT HEALTHIER.
BOBBIE, JUST ON THE TOPIC
OF KIDS BEING PICKY EATERS --
AND, YOU KNOW, MY WIFE
EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING
WITH OUR KIDS --
I ASKED HER ONE DAY,
"YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE
JUST LET THEM STARVE, AND WE'LL
SEE WHEN THEY ACTUALLY --
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS."
JUST SAYING.
YEAH, BUT THE TWO HOURS
OF SCREAMING ISN'T WORTH IT.
John: BOBBIE, UH,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
YOU -- YOU TALKED
ABOUT $40,000 IN SALES RECENTLY,
OR...
$40,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS --
LAST THREE MONTHS.
WHAT DO YOU
ATTRIBUTE THAT TO?
UM, YOU KNOW, WE LAUNCHED
OUR NEXT WEBSITE,
AND, UM, ALSO, WE'RE REALLY BIG
AT BACK-TO-SCHOOL SEASON,
LIKE THE SEASONAL --
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO GET AT --
DID YOU INCLUDE THE TRADE SHOW
IN THAT? SORRY, DAYMOND.
I JUST WANTED TO HEAR
HER POINT.
NO, NO.
I JUST CAME
FROM THE TRADE SHOW.
I HAD 25 ORDERS
THAT ARE STILL COMING IN --
SOME OF THEM LARGER,
SOME OF THEM SMALLER.
BUT REALLY, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
THING THAT HAPPENED
TO THE TRADE SHOW IS I HAD
PEOPLE SEEKING ME OUT.
LIKE DISNEY --
I WAS ON MY CORNER BOOTH,
JUST DOING MY SALE.
VERY TOUGH TO GET
INTO DISNEY -- VERY TOUGH.
AND THE DISNEY GUY HOLDS
THE PACKAGING, AND HE SAYS --
HOW DID YOU KNOW HE'S FROM
DISNEY? HE GIVE YOU A CARD?
HE GAVE ME A CARD, AND HE GOES,
"I'M WITH MARVEL COMICS.
"I THINK WE CAN, LIKE,
CHANGE THE PACKAGING
"TO PUT THE MARVEL COMICS GUY
ON THERE
AND KEEP
YOUR WHOLE CHARACTER."
AND HE WAS REALLY SERIOUS?
HE WAS THERE FOR 20 MINUTES.
AND THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU GUYS.
I DON'T KNOW --
BOBBIE, WHAT --
W-W-WHY ARE YOU HERE?
WHY DO YOU NEED THE MONEY?
OKAY, WELL, UM, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE TRIED TO GET ON THIS SHOW
FOR THREE YEARS.
MY DAD IN PITTSBURGH --
YOU MADE IT!
YEAH! I KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Cuban: WE'RE DONE HERE.
I THINK WE'RE DONE.
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
I HAVE TAKEN THIS COMPANY AS --
AS FAR AS I CAN GO
AS ONE PERSON.
I WORK 24/7.
I'M THE HARDEST WORKER.
THEY USED TO CALL ME AT REVLON
THE ENERGIZER BUNNY.
[ Voice breaking ]
UH, I JUST --
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET THOSE DOORS OPEN.
ONCE I GET IN, I CAN SELL IT.
I KNOW HOW TO SELL MY PRODUCT,
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING HERE,
FIRST OF ALL.
THANK YOU.
I'M, LIKE, ABOUT TO CRY,
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY?
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY?
YOU KNOW, I COULD DO ANYTHING
WITH THE MONEY,
BUT WHAT I'M MOSTLY ASKING FOR
IS FOR YOU GUYS
TO HELP ME OPEN UP THE DOORS
TO GET INTO THE BIG-BOX
RETAILERS AND EXPLORE THE P--
YOU KNOW,
POTENTIAL OF LICENSING.
AND ADDITIONALLY, UM, I RECENTLY
FOUND THAT WE HAVE A BIG NICHE
WITH THE SPECIAL-NEEDS
MARKET.
WE JUST GOT
THE AblePlay AWARD,
WHICH IS FOR CHILDREN
WITH AUTISM.
AND THE AUTISTIC KIDS
LOVE THE SQUARES
BECAUSE THE SQUARES ARE VERY
NEAT, ORGANIZED, AND SIMPLE.
SO, UM, THAT'S A WHOLE MARKET
THAT I'M JUST BEGINNING
TO EXPLORE.
OH, YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.
L-LOOK, BOBBIE, I-I DON'T SEE
WORLD DOMINATION
OF, UH,
FOOD-SLICING DEVICES,
AND FRANKLY, I SAY TO A CHILD
THAT WON'T EAT FOOD,
"OKAY, DON'T EAT."
BOBBIE, I'M OUT.
BOBBIE, LET ME --
LET ME CLEAR THINGS A LITTLE BIT
AND TELL YOU WHERE I'M AT.
UH, I WAS A STAY-AT-HOME DAD
FOR THREE YEARS,
AND I-I AGREE WITH YOU.
I USED TO TAKE A KNIFE
AND USED TO DRIVE MY WIFE NUTS
'CAUSE EVERY MEAL WE HAD
WAS CUT UP INTO FUNNY SHAPES.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
KIDS WILL EAT IT IF IT'S FUN.
BUT I-I-I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS
WHEN THE ALTERNATIVE
IS SIMPLY TAKING A KNIFE
AND CUTTING THE FOOD.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
OKAY, THREE SHARKS ARE LEFT.
SO, I'M SOMEONE
INTERESTED IN THIS,
AND I THINK THE THINGS
THAT INTEREST ME
IS, UH, THE LICENSING.
WE KNOW THE MARVEL GUY
FAIRLY WELL.
AND I CAN GET YOU
THE OTHER LICENSES.
UM, SO I'LL MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
SO THE OFFER WILL BE
$100,000 FOR 30%.
OOH. I THINK YOU
ONLY ASKED FOR $75,000.
MORE MONEY
AND GREATER EQUITY.
I JUST WANT A LITTLE BIT MORE
EQUITY SO WE CAN --
YOU KNOW,
I-IT'S WORTH OUR TIME.
UM, 'CAUSE I KNOW
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO OUT THERE
FOR ALL THESE LICENSES,
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME.
O'Leary:
SO, LORI, DAYMOND HAS THROWN
A TRIANGULAR PIECE OF CHEESE
IN YOUR FACE
WITH THAT OFFER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[ LAUGHS ]
LORI, IT ALSO WOULD BE
A GREAT QVC PRODUCT.
YOU KNOW, WE COULD --
PEOPLE --
WELL, YOU KNOW,
AS I'M THINKING ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A SPECIAL
SECTION IN BED BATH &amp; BEYOND.
I'M GLAD I GAVE YOU
THAT CONTACT.
I HAVE MY PRODUCTS --
WE ALL HAVE SPECIAL SECTIONS
IN BED BATH &amp; BEYOND.
BOBBIE,
I MADE YOU AN OFFER.
DAYMOND,
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
CAN I JUST HEAR
THE OTHER OFFERS?
IT TOOK ME
SO LONG TO GET HERE,
I JUST WANT TO HEAR
ALL THE OFFERS.
SO, GUESS WHAT TIME IT IS?
WHAT TIME IS IT?
IT'S DEAL TIME.
[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ]
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
BOBBIE HAS AN OFFER FROM DAYMOND
FOR HER FOOD-CUTTING PRODUCT,
FunBites,
BUT LORI ALSO SEEMS INTERESTED.
GUESS WHAT TIME IT IS.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
IT'S DEAL TIME, SO...
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, I'M THINKING HERE.
I HAVE ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS
WITH THE STORES --
THE BED BATH, THE buybuy BABY,
THE TOYS"R"US -- ALL OF THAT.
I BELIEVE THE RETAIL PLAY
IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU.
MM-HMM.
I THINK YOU NEED TO
GET IT OUT THERE,
LIKE, IN ALL THOSE LOCATIONS
AND DO YOUR WEBSITE.
MM-HMM.
I MEAN, I THINK
YOU NEED TO BE BOTH.
I LIKE TO BLITZ
THE MARKET.
RIGHT.
AND THE OFFER IS...

LORI, HOW MANY PRODUCTS
HAVE YOU LICENSED?
DAYMOND --
LORI, LISTEN --
I HAVE ACTUALLY LICENSED...
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
...FIVE PRODUCTS.
JUST SUMMARIZE.
IF YOU WANT TO DO LICENSING
AND YOU WANT ALL THOSE BRANDS,
I AM THE ONE TO DO IT.
BUT I CAN LICENSE, TOO.
I'VE ALREADY DONE SIX LICENSES
ON THIS SHOW.
LISTEN, SHE HAS NO ANSWER
IN REGARDS TO LICENSING
'CAUSE IT'S ZERO.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $100,000.
OKAY, LET'S TALK, BOBBIE.
I'LL ACTUALLY MATCH HERS.
HERE'S MARK'S OFFER.
HERE'S MARK'S OFFER COMING.
I'M GONNA DO $100,000 NOW
FOR 25%.
WHOA! HANG ON. DAYMOND,

LORI...I'LL DO IT.
YEAH!
YAY!
ALL RIGHT!
WAY TO GO, BOBBIE!
WHOO-HOO!

BOBBIE.
IT'S HER MISTAKE.
WOW. LOOK AT THAT.

I'M SO HAPPY.
BOBBIE,
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL.
AND WE'RE GONNA
MAKE THIS HUGE.
HUGE!
YEAH.
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL.
BOBBIE, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW WHY, BOBBIE?
LOOK --
YOU GOT A GOOD PARTNER.
I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING BAD
ABOUT LORI.
WE'VE PARTNERED IN DEALS.
SHE DOES THINGS WELL, RIGHT?
BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S
A BENEFIT TO LISTENING.
AND ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.
BOBBIE, YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO DO SOMETHING UNIQUE
AND A FIRST IN THE TANK --
THROW LORI UNDER THE BUS
WITH THE RISK OF NOT YET
HAVING HEARD MARK'S OFFER.
DON'T DO IT, BOBBIE.
THROW HER UNDER THE BUS!
I LOVE MARK. YOU KNOW,
HE'S FROM THE BURGH, TOO.
AND -- AND -- AND I WISH
I WOULD'VE HEARD HIS OFFER.
BUT TO BE HONEST, I KNOW LORI'S
THE RIGHT PARTNER FOR ME.
YOU KNOW, I KNOW SHE CAN
FIX THE PACKAGING.
Greiner: THANK YOU, BOBBIE.
O'Leary:
THROW HER UNDER THE BUS!
I KNOW YOU'RE A PERSON
OF INTEGRITY, BOBBIE.
WOULD YOU WANT TO
BRING MARK IN?
NO.
OH!
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I JUST HAVE TO GIVE --
O'Leary:
BOBBIE, BEFORE YOU LEAVE --
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT
FOR HIM.
GOOD LUCK, BOBBIE.
Greiner:
GOOD LUCK, BOBBIE.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, GUYS.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
BYE.
UNDER THE BUS!
I REALLY THOUGHT
SHE WAS GONNA GO FOR IT.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD HER.
I'M SO EXCITED.
IT WAS EXACTLY WHO I WANTED
AND A PERFECT DEAL FOR ME.
