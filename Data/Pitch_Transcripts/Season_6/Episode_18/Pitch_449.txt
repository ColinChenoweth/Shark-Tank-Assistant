I'M MELISSA BUTLER.
UGH.
HAVE YOU BUILT THIS?
Butler:
IT'S IN THE PROCESS.
IT'S ACTUALLY BEING CONVERTED
IN DETROIT RIGHT NOW.
OH, THAT IS
SUCH A BAD IDEA.
SO, ROSCO,
AREN'T YOU WORRIED,
IF YOU WALKED INTO A BAR
WITH THAT COLOR LIP,
SOMEBODY WOULD TRY
TO RESUSCITATE YOU?
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO.
WHEN I WALK INTO THE BAR
OR INTO THE MALL
OR ANYWHERE
WITH THIS COLOR LIP,
EVERYONE
IS VERY INQUISITIVE.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE
I GOT IT FROM, WHO MADE IT,
WHERE DID I GET
THIS CRAZY SHADE,
