I'M SUMAN.
I'M NISHES.
WE BOTH LIVE
IN MUKILTEO, WASHINGTON,
BUT WE WERE BORN AND RAISED
IN NEPAL.
I IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA
BECAUSE I WANTED TO PURSUE
HIGHER EDUCATION.
MY FATHER ALWAYS TAUGHT ME THAT
AMERICA IS LAND OF OPPORTUNITY
FOR THOSE WHO EARNED IT.
I SETTLED IN WASHINGTON STATE,
WHERE I MET NISHES.
SINCE WE WERE BOTH
FROM NEPAL,
WE BONDED REAL QUICK
AND BECAME REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.
[ TRADITIONAL
INDIAN MUSIC PLAYS ]
HOW'S IT GOING OUT THERE?
WHERE YOU AT?
SUJAN IS MY BROTHER AND THIRD
PARTNER OF OUR BUSINESS.
HE IS HANDLING MOST
OF THE PRODUCT IN NEPAL.
BACK IN THE DAY, OUR PEOPLE
CAME UP WITH THIS SNACK
MADE OUT OF YAK MILK.
80% OF PEOPLE IN NEPAL
EAT THESE SNACKS.
IT'S A HIGH SOURCE OF PROTEIN
FOR THEM.
I KNEW THIS COULD BE
OUR PATH TO SUCCESS,
AND WE GOT RIGHT TO WORK.
GOOD JOB, MAN.
WE'VE BEEN DOING
REALLY GOOD,
BUT WE HAVE POTENTIAL TO BE
A HUGE BUSINESS.
BUT FOR THAT,
WE NEED SHARKS.
WE GIVE 100% OF OUR TIME
AND ENERGY, BUT WE NEED HELP.
WE NEED SHARK TO TAKE
OUR BUSINESS TO NEXT LEVEL
AND MAKE OUR AMERICAN DREAM
COME TRUE.
[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ]
NAMASTE.
NAMASTE.
NAMASTE.
MY NAME
IS SUMAN SHRESTHA.
I AM
NISHES SHRESTHA.
AND I AM
SUJAN SHRESTHA.
AND WE COME ALL THE WAY
FROM THE HIMALAYAS.
OUR COMPANY
IS HIMALAYAN DOG CHEW,
AND WE ARE SEEKING $750,000
FOR 5% STAKE IN OUR COMPANY.
HOLY...
WOW.
WOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE'VE TAKEN
THIS AUTHENTIC CHEESE
EATEN BY THE PEOPLE
OF THE HIMALAYAS
AND TURNED IT INTO
A NUTRIENT-PACKED DOG TREAT.
AND DOGS LOVE OUR TREAT --
NOT ONLY DOGS --
DOG PARENTS LOVE IT, TOO,
BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL.
SHARKS, OUR CHEWS ARE MADE
WITH TRADITIONAL METHODS
WITH ONLY FOUR INGREDIENTS --
YAK AND COW MILK,
SALT, AND LIME JUICE.
THE MILK IS BOILED
AND COAGULATED INTO CHEESE,
WHICH IS THEN DRIED AND SMOKED
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
INTO HARD, SMOKED CHEESE
LIKE THIS.
ONCE YOUR DOG CHEWS
THIS LARGE PIECE
INTO A SMALL PIECE
LIKE THIS,
SIMPLY MICROWAVE IT
FOR ABOUT 45 SECONDS TO A MINUTE
AND PUFF IT LIKE THIS,
INTO A CRUMBLY,
CRUNCHY CHEESE PUFF
SO THAT THERE IS
NO CHOKING HAZARD
AND NO WASTE AT ALL.
HIMALAYAN DOG CHEW IS THE BEST
TREAT OUT IN THE MARKET,
AND OUR SALES HAVE
BEEN INCREASING,
BUT NOW WE NEED
YOUR HELP
TO TAKE OUR COMPANY
AND OUR VENTURE
INTO THE NEXT LEVEL.
WE WOULD LIKE TO NOW
HAND OUT OUR SAMPLES.
IT'S FOR DOGS --
I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR.
YES.
ALL RIGHT.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
DON'T TRY IT,
ROBERT.
THESE PACKAGES ARE ALREADY
OPENED FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT
SO THAT YOU CAN
TEAR IT OUT.
Herjavec:
SO -- SO, WAIT -- IN NEPAL,
IS THIS A SPECIAL CHEESE
THAT'S ONLY AVAILABLE THERE?
CURRENTLY,
I WOULD SAY YES.
THERE IS SOME AVAILABLE
IN INDIA, AS WELL,
BUT MOSTLY IN NEPAL.
AND IN NEPAL, IS IT FOR DOGS,
OR DO HUMANS EAT IT?
IT'S FOR HUMANS.
PIECES LIKE THIS,
WE CHEW THEM.
YOU DO?
REALLY?!
YES.
IS IT EXACTLY THE SAME?
SO IF WE STARTED CHEWING ON IT,
IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT?
OH, YEAH,
YOU WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
BUT WHAT WE DO IS,
WHEN WE BRING IT --
BRING IT TO THE U.S.,
WE PROCESS IT A LITTLE BIT
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE HARDER.
IT'S REALLY HARD.
WHAT ARE THE OTHER PRODUCTS?
WHAT'S THAT WHITE STUFF?
WE USE THAT SAME PUFFING
CHARACTER OF THAT CHEESE
AND PUT IT
IN A POPCORN BAG.
NOW, YOU PUT THIS POPCORN BAG
IN MICROWAVE.
FOR HUMANS OR DOGS?
FOR DOGS, OF COURSE.
DANG!
I WAS HUNGRY.
Cuban:
I WAS HOPING IT WAS...
AND THEN -- AND THEN
YOU PUT IT IN MICROWAVE.
IT POPS
JUST LIKE POPCORN BAG,
YOU OPEN IT UP --
CAN WE TRY IT?
AND THAT'S YAK CHEESE?
YES, IT'S GOOD.
OH, BRING IT ON.
I'M HUNGRY.
IT'S LITERALLY BLAND.
IT'S NO FLAVOR ON IT, THOUGH.
IT'S KIND OF COOL-LOOKING.
JUST EAT IT.
THAT IS
KIND OF COOL-LOOKING.
[ CRUNCHING ]
IT JUST DRIES
IN MOUTH REALLY FAST.
THAT'S NOT BAD, KIND OF,
AS A CHEESE, RIGHT?
OH, MY GOSH!
IT'S REALLY GOOD!
YEAH, YEAH.
TELL US
ABOUT YOUR NUMBERS.
UH, LAST YEAR, WE DID
$5.6 MILLION IN SALES.
OH, MY GOD!
DANG!
WHOA!
THAT'S A LOT OF CHEW.
THAT'S A LOT OF CHEESE.
WE SOLD A LITTLE BIT OVER
A-A MILLION, UH, PACKAGES.
WHERE ARE YOU
SELLING THESE?
WHERE?
DIRECTLY, WE SELL IT IN
LOT OF DIFFERENT INDEPENDENT
PET-SPECIALTY RETAILERS.
WE ARE
IN ABOUT 6,000 STORES.
SO, WHY ARE YOU HERE?
YOU HAVE $5.6 MILLION IN SALES,
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY MAKING
MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS
IN PROFIT, RIGHT?
YES, WE ARE.
YOU'RE KILLIN' IT.
WE'RE HERE
FOR PARTNERSHIP.
YOU CAN BRING VALUE
INTO OUR COMPANY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THREE OF US,
WE ARE REALLY HARDWORKING
IMMIGRANTS FROM NEPAL,
BUT W-WE'RE LOOKING AT SHARKS
IN THE FRONT,
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, UH, LORI, UH,
UH, SHE'S A RETAIL GODDESS.
UH, MR. WONDERFUL --
NOW YOU'RE JUST KISSING UP.
UM, I JUST DON'T SEE --
THAT DOESN'T HURT.
I'M NEXT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GUYS, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.
WE'VE SEEN EVERY KIND
OF DOG TREAT, EVERY KIND OF --
Cuban: YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
THE FIRST COMPANY
TO WALK IN HERE
WITH AN ORGANIC DOG TREAT.
BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEBODY
DO $5.6 MILLION IN THIS.
WHAT IS THE SECRET SAUCE?
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS
FOR THAT.
FIRST, WE, UH -- WE HAD AN,
UH, STRICT FINANCIAL APPROACH.
WE DID NOT TAKE ANY PROFITS
INTO OUR POCKETS.
WE JUST KEPT ON
PUTTING IT BACK.
DID YOU RAISE A LOT OF MONEY
AT -- AT THE BEGINNING?
WE STARTED WITH $2,000.
WHEN THESE GUYS STARTED --
WANTED TO START
THIS BUSINESS --
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
I'M ABOUT TO ASK YOU
FOR A JOB.
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE.
O'Leary:
LET'S GO BACK TO VALUATION --
$15 MILLION, 3 TIMES SALES.
A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE FOR
THE PET-TREAT INDUSTRY, MAYBE?
WE VALUED OUR COMPANY
AT $15 MILLION
IS BECAUSE OF OUR PROJECTION
THIS YEAR,
AS WELL AS WE HAVE THE --
WHAT'S YOUR PROJECTION?
WHAT IS YOUR PROJECTION
FOR THIS YEAR?
UH, THIS YEAR, WE'RE GONNA
DO AT LEAST $8 MILLION.
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE $750,000 FOR?
WELL, $750,000 --
WE -- WE PLAN TO KEEP
HALF OF IT
'CAUSE WE'VE NEVER TAKEN
DIVIDENDS.
AND WE JUST STARTED TAKING
SALARIES LAST YEAR.
YOU MEAN YOU JUST
WANT TO TAKE MY MONEY
AND GIVE IT TO YOURSELF?
REALLY?
Cuban:
I ADMIRE THE HONESTY,
BUT THAT'S [Chuckling] SUCH
A BAD THING TO SAY TO THEM.
GUYS, YEAH, I THINK, UH -- LOOK,
YOU GET CREDIT FOR BEING HONEST,
BUT THE REALITY IS, YOU HAVE
THE CASH FLOW TO PAY YOURSELF.
YOU COULD GO TO THE BANK AND
BORROW AGAINST YOUR CASH FLOW.
I'M NOT BUYING
THAT YOU NEED US.
THIS IS A GREAT
P.R. OPPORTUNITY.
YOU'RE SMART FOR TRYING
TO DO IT, BUT YOU DON'T NEED US.
I'M OUT.
GUYS, RATHER THAN DEBATE
THE MERITS
OR THE REASON YOU'RE HERE,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'M NOT GONNA PUT IN $750,000
FOR EQUITY.
I'M GONNA MAKE IT DEBT.
BUT YOU KNOW,
BEFORE I GET DETAILED,
LET'S SEE WHO'S REALLY
INTERESTED
TO SEE
WHO I'M COMPETING WITH.
WHO'S IN ON THIS THING?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND [Chuckling]
HOW YOU GUYS
HAVE DONE SO MUCH MONEY WORTH
OF THIS DOG TREAT.
DOGS LIKE IT.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST MIND--
MIND-BLOWING TO ME.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,
SO I'LL SPARE YOU
A LONG EXPLANATION,
AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU
I'M OUT.
DAYMOND, ARE YOU
INTERESTED OR NOT?
I'M NOT INTERESTED
AT THE MOMENT.
I'M OUT.
Cuban:
LOOK, I'M INTERESTED.
I'M NOT INTERESTED
AT A $15 MILLION VALUE,
BUT I'M INTERESTED.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME THROW
AN OFFER OUT THERE.
WE'LL SEE IF OTHERS WANT TO JOIN
OR THEY WANT TO COMPETE.
