I'M MELISSA BUTLER.
AND I'M ROSCO SPEARS.
Both: AND WE LIVE
IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
OUR COMPANY
IS THE LIP BAR,
AND WE'RE SEEKING
$125,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR BRAND.
THE LIP BAR WAS FOUNDED
OUT OF MY FRUSTRATION
WITH THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY.
I MEAN, COME ON.
WHY DO LIPSTICKS ONLY COME
IN REDS, PINKS, AND NUDES?
FURTHERMORE,
WHY IS IT FILLED
WITH SO MANY UNNECESSARY
CHEMICALS?
I REFUSED TO ACCEPT
THE STANDARD OF BEAUTY
THAT WAS BEING GIVEN TO ME,
AND THE LIP BAR WAS BORN.
OUR FOCUS IS SELF-EXPRESSIVE
AND RESPONSIBLY MADE COSMETICS.
WE OFFER
A WIDE RANGE OF HUES,
EVERYTHING FROM YOUR SPICY REDS
TO CASUAL NUDES
TO NEON PURPLES,
AND EVEN ELECTRIC BLUES.
IN ADDITION TO
OUR AWESOME COLOR RANGE,
ALL OF OUR LIPSTICKS CONTAIN
ORGANIC, FAIR TRADE SHEA BUTTER,
ORGANIC CASTOR
AND AVOCADO OILS.
WE NEVER USE PARABENS.
WE'RE VEGAN AND CRUELTY-FREE.
NOW, WHICH OF YOU SHARKS
ARE GONNA PUCKER UP
AND INVEST
IN THE LIP BAR?
CAN WE GET SAMPLES?
ABSOLUTELY.
YES.
LORI, WE WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO COME
AND SWIPE SOME
ON YOUR HAND.
SO, YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY
A LIPSTICK LINE,
NOT A BAR LIKE HAIR BAR
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
WE'RE A LIPSTICK LINE,
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY THEMATIC.
SO ALL OF THE LIPSTICKS ARE
NAMED AFTER POPULAR COCKTAILS
BECAUSE WE'RE FUN,
WE'RE YOUNG, WE'RE FREE,
AND WE WANT TO ENCOMPASS
THE ESSENCE OF A BAR.
IT'S FULL OF SHEA BUTTER.
IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?
YES. THAT'S NATURAL LIP--
SO, IT'S VERY CREAMY,
AND IT'S VERY SMOOTH.
YES, IT'S FULL
OF SHEA BUTTER.
I CAN TELL THAT. YEAH.
YES.
THANK YOU
FOR TRYING IT.
I AM TAKING MINE WITH ME.
YES, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
CAN YOU PUT
THE BLUE ONE ON HER?
[ LAUGHTER ]
LIPSTICK,
BEAUTY INDUSTRY --
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR
BUSINESS.
YES.
HUGE.
YEP.
MANY BIG PLAYERS
WITH HUGE BRANDS
SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
A QUARTER ADVERTISING THEM.
THEY OWN
THE RETAIL SHELF SPACE.
IF THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD
SELL MORE LIPSTICK
WITH BLUE AND GREEN
AND WHATEVER OTHER COLORS
YOU'VE DREAMT UP,
DON'T YOU THINK
THEY'D DO THAT?
BECAUSE WE KNOW
THAT IT'S ALL VERY SATURATED,
IT'S ALSO
ABOUT THE MESSAGING.
WHAT'S THE MESSAGING?
OUR MESSAGING
IS EMPOWERMENT.
SO, WE BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN
CAN BE WHOEVER THEY WANT TO BE.
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE WITHIN
THIS COOKIE-CUTTER BOX
OF HAVING TO DO WHAT
THE INDUSTRY TELLS US.
HOW DO YOU SHARE
THE EMPOWERMENT MESSAGE?
YEAH, WHERE'S THAT MESSAGE
ON YOUR BRAND?
YEAH, BECAUSE LIPS
ON A COCKTAIL GLASS --
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT SHARES EMPOWERMENT.
WE SHARE THE EMPOWERMENT
OF WOMEN
THROUGH
OUR WIDE COLORINGS,
AND IT'S A FORM OF --
WELL, THE -- THE PROOF
IS IN THE SALES.
RIGHT.
ARE YOU MAKING
ANY MONEY?
SO FAR, WE'VE MADE $107,000
SINCE INCEPTION.
AND THAT'S ALL BEEN
JUST FROM OUR WEBSITE.
SINCE WHEN IS THAT?
HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN?
TWO YEARS.
TWO YEARS.
WHAT DID YOU DO
THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD
IN THE LAST MONTH?
LAST 12--
IN THE LAST MONTH,
WE'VE SOLD $8,000 WORTH.
WHERE ARE YOU MAKING
THESE LIPSTICKS?
I ACTUALLY MAKE THEM
BY HAND MYSELF.
YOU MAKE THEM BY HAND?
YES.
AT -- AT -- AT HOME?
SO I DIDN'T HAVE --
YES.
BUT HOW MUCH I--
HOW MUCH IS EACH UNIT
COSTING YOU TO MAKE,
AND WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?
WHEN I MAKE IT, IT'S $3.
WE SELL IT FOR $20.
Greiner:
GREAT MARGINS.
IT'S SUPER-ADMIRABLE YOU'RE
MAKING IT OUT OF YOUR HOME...
Herjavec:
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
...AND YOU KNOW HOW
TO DO THAT
AND PACK IT
INTO THIS PRETTY CASE.
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN OF ALL
THESE DIFFERENT COMPLEXIONS
AND UNDERTONES TO FIND COLORS
THAT ARE PERFECT FOR THEM.
WE DECIDED TO CREATE
THIS APP
WHERE CUSTOMERS
CAN EASILY LOG ON,
CREATE THEIR OWN CUSTOM COLOR
FROM THESE 10 SHADES.
HOW MUCH DO I PAY YOU
FOR IT?
$32.
THIS IS
A NEW INNOVATION.
I CAN SEE A MASSIVE MARKET SHARE
IN THE CLOWN MARKET.
Herjavec: ROSCO, THE BRAND
SENDS ME A MIXED MESSAGE.
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD WANT
MY DAUGHTER,
UH, PICKING UP LIPSTICK
WITH A MARTINI GLASS
AND, UH, VERY SENSUAL LIPS
ON IT IN RED...
OKAY.
...WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL
THE IDEA OF MULTIPLE COLORS.
I-I'M NOT BUYING
INTO THE BRAND.
I'M OUT.
SO, ONE OF OUR MAIN ISSUES
IS DISTRIBUTION.
WE'VE TALKED TO A LOT
OF LARGE RETAILERS.
AND THE BEAUTY BUYERS, THEY
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PRODUCT.
AND BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS ISSUE
WITH DISTRIBUTION,
INSTEAD OF SITTING
ON OUR BUTTS, WAITING ON,
YOU KNOW, A RETAILER
TO PICK US UP, WE DECIDED TO --
WE CAME UP WITH
THE INNOVATIVE IDEA
TO BUILD
A LIP BAR MOBILE.
A WHAT?
UGH.
HAVE YOU BUILT THIS?
Butler:
IT'S IN THE PROCESS.
IT'S ACTUALLY BEING CONVERTED
IN DETROIT RIGHT NOW.
OH, THAT IS
SUCH A BAD IDEA.
SO, ROSCO,
AREN'T YOU WORRIED,
IF YOU WALKED INTO A BAR
WITH THAT COLOR LIP,
SOMEBODY WOULD TRY
TO RESUSCITATE YOU?
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO.
WHEN I WALK INTO THE BAR
OR INTO THE MALL
OR ANYWHERE
WITH THIS COLOR LIP,
EVERYONE
IS VERY INQUISITIVE.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE
I GOT IT FROM, WHO MADE IT,
WHERE DID I GET
THIS CRAZY SHADE,
AND THAT JUST DRIVES
SALES.
THE CHANCES THAT THIS IS
A BUSINESS ARE PRACTICALLY ZERO
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
GET SHARE.
IF -- IF ANYBODY THOUGHT
YOU COULD SELL PURPLE OR GREEN
LIPSTICK, THEY'D DO IT.
THEY ALREADY HAVE
THE SHELF SPACE.
THEY'D JUST ADD
ANOTHER COLOR.
AND THEY WOULD CRUSH YOU
LIKE THE COLORFUL COCKROACHES
YOU ARE.
YOU ONLY HAVE
SO MANY MINUTES ON EARTH.
DON'T WASTE THEM
TRYING TO SELL LIPSTICK.
I'M OUT.
DAYMOND.
WE KNOW
THAT YOUR EXPERTISE
COULD HELP US
CATAPULT THIS.
YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO CREATE
ANYTHING NEW IN THIS WORLD.
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIPSTICK.
I'M OUT.
IF YOU'RE WALKING PAST
A COUNTER,
AND THERE'S
A LOT OF DIFFERENT BRANDS,
EVEN THE LIPS
ON THE MARTINI GLASS ARE RED.
MM-HMM.
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU HAVE CRAZY COLORS.
LOOK, I GET THAT IF SOMEBODY
WEARS A SHOCKING LIPSTICK
THAT MAKES THEM STAND OUT,
THAT'S A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE.
YES.
YOU KNOW?
THEY'RE WILLING TO SAY,
"I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE
LOOKING AT ME.
I DON'T CARE. THIS IS WHO I AM."
THAT'S GREAT.
BUT YOU KIND OF WENT
COCKTAIL-THEMATIC,
WHICH REALLY
ISN'T THE SAME THING
AS BEING
OVER-THE-TOP CONFIDENT.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SHARK
LEFT -- LORI.
Greiner: LISTEN, YOU GUYS.
I USED TO SELL MAKEUP.
MAKEUP IS A GREAT THING TO SELL
FOR ONE REASON --
IT HAS GREAT MARGINS.
ON THE FLIP SIDE, IT'S ONE
OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO SELL
BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH
INCREDIBLE COMPETITION.
I'M OUT.
SEE YOU GUYS.
SO LONG.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Speers: WE'RE A LITTLE SAD,
A LITTLE HEARTBROKEN
BECAUSE
WE BUILT THIS BABY
AND THEY KIND OF, LIKE,
JUST SHOT IT DOWN.
BUT WE'RE
GONNA KEEP GOING,
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
A MAJOR BRAND,
AND THEY'LL SEE US,
AND THEY'LL BE PROUD OF US.
ROWR!
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A PRODUCT
THAT'S BUILT NOT TO SPILL.
[ CHUCKLES ]
OH, NO.
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT IS JUST NASTY.
UGH.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT IS NOT ATTRACTIVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
