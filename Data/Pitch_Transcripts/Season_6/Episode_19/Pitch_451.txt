HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS C.C. CONRAD.
I'M THE FOUNDER
OF BOOBYPACK,
C.C., HOW MUCH
DOES IT COST?
$7.17 TO MAKE
THE BOOBYPACK.
HOW DO YOU
SUPPORT YOURSELF, C.C.?
UH, SO,
MY DAD PASSED AWAY
[Voice breaking] BEFORE
MY SOPHOMORE YEAR OF COLLEGE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
SORRY. I SAID IT -- MM.
UM...HE LEFT ME
A BIT OF MONEY,
C.C., I LOVE HOW DECISIVE YOU
ARE. THAT WAS AWESOME.
BEFORE YOU REFUSE IT, C.C.,
YOU SHOULD WAIT TO SEE
IF ANY OTHER SHARK
WILL PLAY BALL
BECAUSE IT MAY BE
YOUR ONLY OPTION,
C.C., IT'S ALWAYS GREAT.
I LOVE WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY
WITH THE DRIVE TO GO ALL-IN.
C.C., IT'S NOT --
I'LL HELP YOU DO IT.
I APPRECIATE YOU --
IT -- IT'S NOT
A BAD OFFER.
...JUST TO KEEP TRACK OF THAT.
C.C., THE ONLY THING IS...
$30,000 JUST TO KEEP TRACK
OF THOSE DETAILS.
...CAN YOU AFFORD --
YEAH.
CAN YOU AFFORD TO TAKE
THAT MUCH CASH
OUT OF THE BUSINESS
WHEN YOU'RE GROWING?
LET'S SAY YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
GOOD THINKING, C.C.
WELL, I WOULD LOVE
TO COUNTER YOUR OFFER.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 25%
FOR $80,000?
NO, I'M GONNA -- I'M -- I'M --
I'M GONNA STICK AT THE 30%.
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT --
I THINK -- I --
I'LL TAKE THAT DEAL --
25% FOR $80,000.
YOU'LL TAKE 25%
FOR $80,000?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YES.
YEAH.
Cuban:
WELL DONE, BARB.
THAT'S STRAIGHT OUT
OF MY PLAYBOOK.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
THANK YOU, BARBARA.
WE'LL BE GOOD PARTNERS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANKS. [ LAUGHS ]
OKAY.
YES.
I SHOULD HAVE
FLASHED THIS AT HER
RIGHT WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING
'CAUSE SHE <i>IS</i> DEAD TO ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, GOD.
SO EXCITED TO START
MY PARTNERSHIP WITH BARBARA.
SHE WAS THE SHARK I WAS
GUNNING FOR FROM THE BEGINNING.
