WE COULD ACTUALLY BUILD
A MARKETPLACE SOLUTION?"
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS LIKE,
"WHAT ABOUT THOSE, LIKE, FUNKY,
MY NAME IS MARK PETERSON,
WELL, SO, MARK,
THIS ISN'T A TOY.
PEOPLE AREN'T BUYING THIS
FOR THEIR KIDS.
THEY ARE.
50% OF OUR SALES ARE GIFTS.
RIGHT,
'CAUSE YOU'RE KILLING TIME,
YOU'RE GOING
ON VACATION SOMEWHERE...
MM-HMM. YEAH.
...OR YOU LIVE IN THE
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
"LET'S GO PAN FOR GOLD."
YEP. EXACTLY.
MARK, I THINK IT'S CUTE,
BUT I SEE IT AS A HOBBY.
I'M OUT.
I'M SITTING HERE -- "SHOULD
I BUY INTO THIS BUSINESS --
A CLEVER LITTLE GIFT,
IT'S WHOLESOME?"
MM-HMM.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.
I THINK THAT'S
THE BIGGER MARKET, FOR SURE.
BUT HAVE YOU TRIED?
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM?
I'VE SUBMITTED IT TO BASS PRO'S.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.
DO THEY SELL A PANNING KIT
RIGHT NOW?
ABSOLUTELY.
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO DOES THIS
WITH A PUMP.
HANG ON. MARK,
WOULD YOU CONSIDER --
WE CAN'T REALLY SEE
THE FACE OF THAT GOLD PANNER.
WHAT IF KEVIN'S FACE
WAS THERE?
THEN IT WOULDN'T BE A KIDS' TOY
ANY LONGER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: I LOVE YOU.
THEN IT WOULD BE GREAT
AT HALLOWEEN!
IT WOULD BE.
MARK,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU GOT TWO GREAT OFFERS.
YOU KNOW, ROBERT...
...WE GOT A DEAL.
YOU GOT IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
AWESOME. THANK YOU.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA SELL
A TON OF THEM.
I THINK WE WILL.
THANKS A LOT, FOLKS.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: CONGRATULATIONS.
Cuban: THANKS, ROBERT.
MARK, YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Cuban: OH, YEAH,
GOLD RUSH NUGGET BUCKET.
Greiner: AWW.
THAT'S A ROYALTY
RIGHT THERE.
[ LAUGHS ]
ROBERT, I WANT 15%.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S ONE GOOD-LOOKING MINER.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
WHICH ARE HITTING THE MARKET
LATER THIS WEEK.
THANK YOU.
SO, C.C., YOU'VE DONE
A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF WORK
IN A VERY SHORT
AMOUNT OF TIME.
YOU'RE QUICK,
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT'S BETTER THAN QUICK,
WHICH IS WHAT MARK SAID --
RELENTLESS.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $80,000.
I JUST WANT
A LITTLE MORE EQUITY
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS
A BIT OF A LONGER-TERM PLAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $80,000
FOR 30%.
Corcoran:
YOU DON'T NEED HIM.
I'M GONNA MODIFY MY OFFER.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE $80,000 FOR A $10 ROYALTY.
AFTER I RECOUP $320,000,
WHICH IS FOUR TIMES
ON MY CAPITAL,
THAT ROYALTY GOES AWAY.
WHAT REMAINS IS
A 5% EQUITY POSITION.
THE ROYALTY GOES AWAY AFTER
YOU PROVE THIS BUSINESS OUT.
MARKING, IMPRESSION --
