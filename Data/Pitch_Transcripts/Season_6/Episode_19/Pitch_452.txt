HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS C.C. CONRAD.
I'M THE FOUNDER
OF BOOBYPACK,
AND I'M SEEKING
AN $80,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20%
OF MY COMPANY.
THE BOOBYPACK IS THE FANNY PACK
FOR YOUR RACK.
[ HERJAVEC AND GREINER CHUCKLE ]
IT'S ESSENTIALLY
A FASHIONABLE SPORTS BRA
WITH TWO ZIPPER-ENCLOSED POCKETS
ON EITHER SIDE
THAT HOLD YOUR VALUABLES
LIKE YOUR KEYS, CASH, I.D.,
AND PHONE,
WHILE KEEPING THEM SAFE
AND SECURE.
AND THE POCKETS
ARE WATER-RESISTANT
SO KATIE HERE CAN GO TO
HER FAVORITE MUSICAL FESTIVAL...
[ LAUGHS ]
...DANCE, JUMP UP AND DOWN,
EVEN GET WET...
WITHOUT WORRYING
ABOUT LOSING
OR RUINING HER VALUABLES
IN THE PROCESS.
IT'S THE ULTIMATE
CHEEKY SOLUTION
TO THE "STASH YOUR STUFF"
DILEMMA.
SO, WHICH ONE
OF YOU SHARKS
IS READY TO BECOME
MY <i>BREAST</i> FRIEND?
DO WE WE GET SAMPLES?
YES, WE MADE A CROATIAN FLAG
BOOBYPACK FOR YOU, ROBERT.
OH, THANK YOU.
LORI, YOU'RE
ACTUALLY GOING TO GET
ONE OF
THE FIRST TANKINIS,
C.C., HOW MUCH
DOES IT COST?
$7.17 TO MAKE
THE BOOBYPACK.
AND HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
$55.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
DO YOU MIND TELLING US
WHEN YOU STARTED,
AND THEN TELL US
WHAT YOUR SALES WERE EACH YEAR?
SO, WE STARTED ON KICKSTARTER
IN JANUARY 2013,
AND WE DOUBLED OUR FUNDRAISING
GOAL, AND WE'RE LISTED
AS ONE OF THE MOST-FUNDED
FASHION PROJECTS.
WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL?
OUR GOAL WAS $15,000,
AND WE GOT $32,000 IN 30 DAYS.
IN JUNE OF LAST YEAR,
WE LAUNCHED OUR WEBSITE
AND SOLD $10,000 WORTH
OF PRODUCT THE FIRST DAY AND --
THE FIRST DAY?
THE FIRST DAY.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN SALES
SINCE YOU OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED?
$167,000 IN SALES.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
HOW DID YOU MAKE ALL
THOSE SALES? WAS IT ALL ONLINE?
UM, SO, YES,
WE'VE BEEN ALMOST -- PRIM--
LIKE, 99.9% DIRECT
TO E-COMMERCE.
WHAT'S YOUR GAME PLAN?
ARE YOU GONNA STAY ONLINE?
ARE YOU GONNA RETAIL?
SO, SO FAR,
BECAUSE IT'S JUST BEEN ME,
STAYING ONLINE
HAS ALLOWED ME
TO REALLY CONTROL
THE BRAND IDENTITY.
THAT SAID, I'M READY TO TAKE
BOOBYPACK TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
I'M CURIOUS HOW PEOPLE
ARE FINDING YOUR SITE.
WE HAVE DONE, UM,
SOME S.E.O...
GOOD.
...UM, FOR A BRA WITH POCKETS,
RAVE BRA.
DO YOU PROMOTE ON PINTEREST
AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
YES, WE HAVE, OF COURSE.
WE HAVE PINTEREST,
INSTAGRAM, TWITTER.
HOW MANY FOLLOWERS DO YOU HAVE
ON YOUR FACEBOOK?
WE HAVE 11,000,
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GROWING
BY 400 A WEEK.
Cuban:
YEAH, BUT FACEBOOK DOESN'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF RETURN
THESE DAYS, RIGHT,
BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO BUY
TO PROMOTE.
WHAT IS YOUR
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST,
WHERE ARE YOU FINDING
THOSE CUSTOMERS,
AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU HAD
MORE SALES?
WELL, SO, OUR CUSTOMER-
ACQUISITION COST IS $7.17,
AND THEY TYPICALLY SPEND
ABOUT $80 ON THE SITE.
AND THAT'S REALLY
JUST USING FACEBOOK.
AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID
THAT WE'VE DONE SOME S.E.O.,
BUT IT'S BEEN VERY MINIMAL.
WE'RE ABOUT TO RAMP UP S.E.O.
AND START AN AdWords CAMPAIGN.
'CAUSE I WOULD THINK,
IF IT'S $7 TO GET $80
WITH HIGH MARGINS...
MM-HMM.
...JUST SPEND AWAY, RIGHT?
'CAUSE IT REPLENISHES AND --
AND SELF-FINANCES.
WHY -- WHY NOT DO MORE?
RIGHT, I MEAN, WE HAVE REMAINED
CASH-FLOW-POSITIVE
SINCE OUR KICKSTARTER.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE $10,000
IN THE BANK NOW, $7,000 IN --
BUT YOU HAVEN'T PAID YOURSELF
ANYTHING, RIGHT?
HOW --
I HAVE NOT, NO,
FOR TWO YEARS.
HOW DO YOU
SUPPORT YOURSELF, C.C.?
UH, SO,
MY DAD PASSED AWAY
[Voice breaking] BEFORE
MY SOPHOMORE YEAR OF COLLEGE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
SORRY. I SAID IT -- MM.
UM...HE LEFT ME
A BIT OF MONEY,
AND SO I'VE BEEN USING THAT
TO -- TO FUND THIS.
IT WAS MOSTLY INTENDED
FOR GRAD SCHOOL,
BUT HE WAS AN ENTREPRENEUR,
SO I THINK HE'D BE HAPPY
AT HOW I'VE USED IT.
C.C., I LOVE HOW DECISIVE YOU
ARE. THAT WAS AWESOME.
BEFORE YOU REFUSE IT, C.C.,
YOU SHOULD WAIT TO SEE
IF ANY OTHER SHARK
WILL PLAY BALL
BECAUSE IT MAY BE
YOUR ONLY OPTION,
AND SOMETIMES
THE ONLY OPTION IS A GOOD ONE.
Corcoran:
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK UP.
I THINK YOU'RE A
GREAT ENTREPRENEUR IN EVERY WAY.
YOU'RE THE WHOLE PACKAGE.
THANK YOU.
SO, I'M GOING TO BE OUT
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED ANY HELP.
OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
C.C., IT'S ALWAYS GREAT.
I LOVE WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY
WITH THE DRIVE TO GO ALL-IN.
AND YOU'RE FOLLOWING
IN YOUR FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS
BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR.
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
ON A GREAT TRAJECTORY
TO KEEP BUILDING IT SLOWLY,
BUT IT'S JUST TOO EARLY
FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
C.C., IT'S NOT --
I'LL HELP YOU DO IT.
I APPRECIATE YOU --
IT -- IT'S NOT
A BAD OFFER.
YEAH.
AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA SLAM IT OR --
OR SPEAK ILL OF IT.
THAT'S A LOT OF EQUITY.
EXCEPT LET ME TELL YOU...
BUT LET ME JUST --
...YOU'LL PAY AN ACCOUNTANT
$30,000 A YEAR...
BARBARA, CAN I TALK?
FOR GOODNESS' SAKES, BARBARA --
...JUST TO KEEP TRACK OF THAT.
C.C., THE ONLY THING IS...
$30,000 JUST TO KEEP TRACK
OF THOSE DETAILS.
...CAN YOU AFFORD --
YEAH.
CAN YOU AFFORD TO TAKE
THAT MUCH CASH
OUT OF THE BUSINESS
WHEN YOU'RE GROWING?
LET'S SAY YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
AND YOU SELL THIS BUSINESS
ONE DAY FOR $10 MILLION,
WHICH I THINK
YOU'D LIKE TO DO, RIGHT?
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.
BASICALLY, YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO
HAVE TO PAY ME A FRACTION
OF WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY HIM.
THINK ABOUT IT -- YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE UP $3 MILLION.
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER
AND CHANGING IT,
BUT I DO NOT WANT
TO BE GIVING AWAY MONEY
AS MY BUSINESS IS GROWING.
YOU ARE
GIVING AWAY MONEY.
YOU'RE GIVING 30% OF IT
AWAY FOREVER.
LET HER TALK!
GOOD THINKING, C.C.
WELL, I WOULD LOVE
TO COUNTER YOUR OFFER.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 25%
FOR $80,000?
NO, I'M GONNA -- I'M -- I'M --
I'M GONNA STICK AT THE 30%.
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT --
I THINK -- I --
I'LL TAKE THAT DEAL --
25% FOR $80,000.
YOU'LL TAKE 25%
FOR $80,000?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YES.
YEAH.
Cuban:
WELL DONE, BARB.
THAT'S STRAIGHT OUT
OF MY PLAYBOOK.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
THANK YOU, BARBARA.
WE'LL BE GOOD PARTNERS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANKS. [ LAUGHS ]
OKAY.
YES.
I SHOULD HAVE
FLASHED THIS AT HER
RIGHT WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING
'CAUSE SHE <i>IS</i> DEAD TO ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, GOD.
SO EXCITED TO START
MY PARTNERSHIP WITH BARBARA.
SHE WAS THE SHARK I WAS
GUNNING FOR FROM THE BEGINNING.
I KNOW SHE'S SO HANDS ON
WITH ALL OF HER DEALS,
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE BOOBYPACK
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
[ LAUGHS ]

NEXT UP IS AN INNOVATION IN THE
GROWING DO-IT-YOURSELF MARKET.
