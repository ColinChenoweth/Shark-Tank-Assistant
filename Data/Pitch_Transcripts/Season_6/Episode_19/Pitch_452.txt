AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
WE COULD ACTUALLY BUILD
A MARKETPLACE SOLUTION?"
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS LIKE,
"WHAT ABOUT THOSE, LIKE, FUNKY,
STRAPPY SANDALS YOU WORE IN
COLLEGE THAT EVERYBODY LOVED?"
I HAD MADE THESE SANDALS
IN COLLEGE OUT OF, LITERALLY,
FLIP-FLOP BOTTOMS
AND RIBBON.
AND IT WAS ONE OF
THOSE THINGS WHERE,
WHEN I WOULD WEAR IT,
PEOPLE WOULD LITERALLY
STOP ME ON THE STREET
AND ASK ME ABOUT THEM.
AND SO I WAS LIKE,
"OKAY, SURE, SANDALS."
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THEN I WENT TO THE SCHOOL
AND HIRED THREE WOMEN --
MARY, MERCY,
AND REBECCA --
AND TAUGHT THEM
HOW TO MAKE THE SANDALS
AND BASICALLY SAID,
"OKAY, IF YOU PROMISE
"TO MAKE THESE SANDALS
FOR THE NEXT NINE MONTHS,
I PROMISE THAT YOU WILL GO
TO COLLEGE IN THE FALL."
MY NAME IS MARK PETERSON,
AND I'M FROM
BEAUTIFUL EUGENE, OREGON.
MY COMPANY IS
THE GOLD RUSH NUGGET BUCKET,
AND TODAY I'M SEEKING 60,000
OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 15% OF MY COMPANY.
GOLD -- EVERYBODY WANTS IT.
WARS HAVE BEEN FOUGHT FOR IT.
IT LITERALLY MAKES OUR WORLD
GO 'ROUND.
BUT BEST OF ALL,
IT'S EVERYWHERE,
JUST WAITING TO BE FOUND.
AND IT USED TO BE
YOU NEEDED TO SPEND HOURS
WORKING WITH A GOLD PAN
AND PANNING PLAIN OL' DIRT.
"TOO MUCH WORK AND NOT
ENOUGH FUN," IS WHAT I SAID.
SO, SHARKS, I'VE MADE IT EASY
AND FUN FOR EVERYONE,
INCLUDING KIDS, TO FIND GOLD.
INTRODUCING
THE GOLD RUSH NUGGET BUCKET.
NOW, THE NUGGET BUCKET IS NOT
JUST ANOTHER GOLD-PANNING KIT.
THIS KIT CONCENTRATES THE GOLD
INTO THIS SMALL BOWL,
WHICH THEN MAKES THE PANNING
PROCESS SUPER-EASY AND FUN.
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE.
SIMPLY SCOOP IN
AS MUCH DIRT...AS YOU WANT,
POUR IN AS MUCH WATER
AS YOU WANT...
...AND THEN LET GRAVITY
DO ALL THE WORK.
THE LONGER YOU DO THIS,
THE MORE GOLD WILL CONCENTRATE
IN THIS BOWL.
WHEN FINISHED,
SIMPLY REMOVE THE BOWL,
DUMP THE CONTENTS INTO YOUR PAN,
AND NOW YOU'RE READY
TO PAN SUPER-CONCENTRATED DIRT.
WELL, SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO DIG INTO
THIS WORLDWIDE OPPORTUNITY AND
STRIKE IT EXTRA-RICH WITH ME?
WELL, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
I TOOK MY TWO DAUGHTERS DOWN
TO THE RIVER
TO FIND SOME ROCKS
FOR THEIR ROCK POLISHER.
SO, I BOUGHT
A FIVE-GALLON BUCKET
AND A COUPLE SCREENS
AND STACKED THEM ON TOP,
AND THEY PLAYED
FOR AN HOUR OR TWO,
JUST SCOOPING IN DIRT,
POURING IN WATER.
THEY HAD THE BEST TIME.
SO, I KNEW
I WAS ONTO SOMETHING.
O'Leary:
ALL THE EASY PANNING LOCATIONS
WERE JUST DUG OUT
DECADES AGO.
YOU KNOW, UM...
YOU GOT TO WALK WAY UP THE RIVER
IF YOU WANT TO FIND GOLD.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND GOLD
IN THE HOME DEPOT SAND.
DO THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS?
[ LAUGHS ]
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ENOUGH
TO PAY FOR THE BAG OF SAND,
BUT IT CONTAINS ENOUGH
TO HAVE FUN.
IS IT, LIKE,
GOLD FLAKES OR --
YEAH, UH,
IT'S CALLED MICRON GOLD.
I DO HAVE A SCREEN
THAT WILL SHOW THE GOLD RING
THAT WILL FORM IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE THIS BOWL.
GOLD! GOLD!
SO, THAT GOLD THERE
IS FINE ENOUGH
THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY FLOAT
ON THE SURFACE TENSION OF WATER.
PART OF THE PATENTED PROCESS IS,
IS THAT THE COLUMN OF WATER
COMING OUT OF THE FUNNEL
PENETRATES THE LAYER OF SAND
IT NATURALLY CREATES
AND THEN HITS THE BOTTOM OF
THE BOWL AND THEN SPREADS OUT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
ARE YOU SELLING THIS ANYWHERE?
ONLINE ONLY, $290,000...
Greiner: WOW.
WOW.
...IN THE FIRST 17 MONTHS.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?
$99.95 PLUS SHIPPING
AND HANDLING.
WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT
ON IT?
ABOUT 70% MARGIN.
WELL, SO, MARK,
THIS ISN'T A TOY.
PEOPLE AREN'T BUYING THIS
FOR THEIR KIDS.
THEY ARE.
50% OF OUR SALES ARE GIFTS.
RIGHT,
'CAUSE YOU'RE KILLING TIME,
YOU'RE GOING
ON VACATION SOMEWHERE...
MM-HMM. YEAH.
...OR YOU LIVE IN THE
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
"LET'S GO PAN FOR GOLD."
YEP. EXACTLY.
AND WHAT WERE
YOUR TOTAL --
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU PUT INTO IT?
I PUT $192,000 INTO THIS.
WHOA!
HOW DO YOU SPEND $192,000
ON THIS?
YOU HAD TO BUY
A LOT OF BUCKETS AT WALMART.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH. EXACTLY.
THE MOLDS --
ALMOST $150,000.
WHAT'S UNIQUE
IN THAT BUCKET THAT'S YOURS?
THIS FUNNEL AND THE TWO SCREENS,
THE BOWL, AND THE BASE.
I HAVE TWO PATENTS ISSUED
IN THE UNITED STATES.
I THINK
IT'S A COOL IDEA, RIGHT?
IT REALLY IS ENTERTAINING,
AND IT'S FUN,
BUT IT'S NOT THE GOLD I PAN FOR
ON A DAILY BASIS.
I'M OUT.
MARK, I THINK IT'S CUTE,
BUT I SEE IT AS A HOBBY.
I'M OUT.
I'M SITTING HERE -- "SHOULD
I BUY INTO THIS BUSINESS --
A CLEVER LITTLE GIFT,
IT'S WHOLESOME?"
MM-HMM.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.
"OR SHOULD I JUST BUY ONE
FOR MY HUSBAND, BILL?"
CHEAPER.
AND PUT HIM TO WORK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PUT HIM OUT
IN THE STREAM.
I THINK I'M GONNA BUY ONE
FOR BILL. I'M OUT.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ASPIRATIONS
TO PUT THIS INTO RETAIL
AT A DICK'S
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
NO, ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK THAT'S
THE BIGGER MARKET, FOR SURE.
BUT HAVE YOU TRIED?
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM?
I'VE SUBMITTED IT TO BASS PRO'S.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.
DO THEY SELL A PANNING KIT
RIGHT NOW?
ABSOLUTELY.
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO DOES THIS
WITH A PUMP.
[ BOTH CHUCKLE ]
AND HE PUTS IT AT THE LAKE BED,
IN THE SANDY STUFF.
AND I-I THINK HE'S NUTS,
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
HE FINDS GOLD,
AND HE SAYS, "GOLD!"
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT
SELLING THE GOLD THAT YOU FIND,
IT'S ABOUT FINDING IT.
OH, MY GOD.
YES, IT'S EXCITING.
AND THAT'S --
AND THAT'S --
Greiner:
IT'S THE ADVENTURE.
IT'S THE ADVENTURE,
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY, I THINK
IT'S ADORABLE AS A KIDS' TOY.
MM-HMM.
I THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT COULD BE REALLY FUN.
YEAH.
BUT BECAUSE I SEE THIS
AS A TOY,
NOT REALLY A $99 ITEM
FOR ADULTS...
...I'M OUT.
OKAY.
HANG ON. MARK,
WOULD YOU CONSIDER --
WE CAN'T REALLY SEE
THE FACE OF THAT GOLD PANNER.
WHAT IF KEVIN'S FACE
WAS THERE?
THEN IT WOULDN'T BE A KIDS' TOY
ANY LONGER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: I LOVE YOU.
THEN IT WOULD BE GREAT
AT HALLOWEEN!
IT WOULD BE.
MARK, THE LONGER YOU STAND
THERE, THE MORE I LIKE YOU.
Greiner: MM-HMM.
AND THE MORE ENTERTAINING
IT IS.
ME TOO.
AND THE MORE I LOVE
YOUR ANSWERS.
O'Leary: WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT --
I MEAN, I THINK
IT'S SO LUDICROUS
AND SO FRIVOLOUS
AND SO MINDLESS...
THAT HE'LL TAKE --
...THAT IT HAS MERIT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT --
I DON'T KNOW.
Herjavec: HMM.
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO CRAZY.
WHAT'S YOUR OFFER?
IT'S $60,000 FOR 50%,
NO FLEXIBILITY WHATSOEVER.
OH, MAN.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SELL
A TON OF THESE.
I AGREE.
UNLIKE KEVIN, I'M NOT BLINDED
BY THE GOLD AND THE GREED.
$60,000 FOR 25%.
OH, YOU BETTER SAY YES SO FAST
BEFORE HE SEES ALL THE DIRT.
W-WHAT IS YOUR VISION
FOR MAKING YOU AND I BOTH
A LOT OF MONEY?
YOU'RE JOKING.
Corcoran: NO, HE'S ASKING --
NO, 'CAUSE
HE PROBABLY HAS NO IDEA.
SERIOUSLY?
WHAT, RETAIL? ARE --
ARE YOU THINKING MASS RETAIL
LIKE BIG-BOX STORES?
OH, THAT'S WORK, MAN.
[ LAUGHS ]
HE'S CALLING YOU OUT, ROBERT!
"WHERE ARE YOU?"
"WELL, I'M IN TEXAS NOW."
[ LAUGHTER ]
"I-I'M GOING ACROSS THE STATES.
I'M GOING TO BOB'S.
I'M HOPING
TO SELL TWO BUCKETS."
[ Laughing ] GIVE ME BUCKET
RIGHT NOW! HANG ON.
I'M GONNA GO TO EVERY STORE,
AND SAY...
[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE'S YOUR BUCKET.
ALMOST -- YOU'RE ALMOST --
GIVE ME THE CASH.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
I ACTUALLY THINK
PEOPLE WILL BUY THIS.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A GAG GIFT
WITH A SERIOUS ELEMENT TO IT.
MARK,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU GOT TWO GREAT OFFERS.
YOU KNOW, ROBERT...
...WE GOT A DEAL.
YOU GOT IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
AWESOME. THANK YOU.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA SELL
A TON OF THEM.
I THINK WE WILL.
THANKS A LOT, FOLKS.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: CONGRATULATIONS.
Cuban: THANKS, ROBERT.
MARK, YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
[ LIGHT LAUGHTER ]
Cuban: OH, YEAH,
GOLD RUSH NUGGET BUCKET.
Greiner: AWW.
THAT'S A ROYALTY
RIGHT THERE.
[ LAUGHS ]
ROBERT, I WANT 15%.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S ONE GOOD-LOOKING MINER.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A GARMENT THAT'S FUNCTIONAL
AND FASHIONABLE.
WHICH ARE HITTING THE MARKET
LATER THIS WEEK.
THANK YOU.
AND, MR. WONDERFUL, YOUR
FAVORITE PHRASE IS ON THERE.
WE HOPE YOU WON'T
USE IT ON US.
WHAT'S
THE FAVORITE PHRASE?
Cuban:
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.
"YOU'RE DEAD TO ME."
O'Leary: WOW. I LIKE THAT.
I REALLY LIKE THAT.
AND YOU ARE
"THE REAL DEAL"
AND, OF COURSE,
"MAVERICKS FAN FOR LIFE."
THANK YOU. I LOVE IT.
DOES ONE SIZE FIT ALL,
IN CASE A WOMAN HAS --
IS MORE ENDOWED
THAN ANOTHER?
IT COMES SMALL
TO EXTRA LARGE.
SO, C.C., YOU'VE DONE
A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF WORK
IN A VERY SHORT
AMOUNT OF TIME.
YOU'RE QUICK,
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT'S BETTER THAN QUICK,
WHICH IS WHAT MARK SAID --
RELENTLESS.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $80,000.
I JUST WANT
A LITTLE MORE EQUITY
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS
A BIT OF A LONGER-TERM PLAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $80,000
FOR 30%.
Corcoran:
YOU DON'T NEED HIM.
I'M GONNA MODIFY MY OFFER.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE $80,000 FOR A $10 ROYALTY.
AFTER I RECOUP $320,000,
WHICH IS FOUR TIMES
ON MY CAPITAL,
THAT ROYALTY GOES AWAY.
WHAT REMAINS IS
A 5% EQUITY POSITION.
THE ROYALTY GOES AWAY AFTER
YOU PROVE THIS BUSINESS OUT.
MARKING, IMPRESSION --
SO, LET'S -- LET'S -- LET'S
DUMB IT DOWN AND MAKE IT EASY.
YES.
AND I --
YOU'RE CHARISMATIC.
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF ENERGY.
I LOVE ALL THAT.
NOW REALITY STRIKES,
OKAY?
SURE.
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE
A MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS,
WHICH YOU HAVE.
YES.
IF YOU WERE OPTIMIZING IT,
I WOULD ASSUME YOU COULD
MAKE $150,000 PRETAX.
SURE.
THAT'S $100,000
AFTER TAX.
YES.
