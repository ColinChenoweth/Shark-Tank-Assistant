HI, I'M JESSE GENET.
MY COMPANY IS LUMI.
I'M HERE ASKING FOR $250,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 5% OF MY COMPANY.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN IDEA
FOR A T-SHIRT?
OR MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO PRINT A LOGO

PERMANENT IMAGERY
ON ANY NATURAL MATERIAL?
LET ME SHOW YOU WHY LUMI
IS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE SEEN.
SIMPLY SNAP AN IMAGE, UPLOAD IT
INTO THE FREE LUMI APP.

THIS YEAR, PLEASE.

12 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS,
WE HAVE $1 MILLION IN SALES.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WOW!
O'Leary:
HOW MUCH DID YOU -- HOW MUCH
DID YOU MAKE OFF THE $1 MILLION?
WE ARE NET-POSITIVE 40K,
BUT WE HAVE BEEN RE-INVESTING
THAT WHOLE TIME.
SO, YOU'RE MAKING $1 MILLION
IN SALES.
WHAT ARE
YOUR COST OF GOODS?
WHEN WE SELL DIRECT
ON E-COMMERCE,
OUR MARGINS ARE 91% BLENDED.
WHEN WE SELL

JESSE, I'M NOT CLEAR
WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE SELLING.
OKAY.
YEAH, CAN YOU -- DO YOU HAVE
SAMPLES FOR US TO SEE?

THAT IS $39.99.
TODAY, JESSE, YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO VALUE YOU AT $5 MILLION.
YES.
THAT'S 50 TIMES
YOUR FREE CASH FLOW.
YOU SEE ANY PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU
HOW I ARRIVED AT THE VALUATION.
I JUST ARRIVED AT IT.
IT'S -- IT'S RIDICULOUS.
JESSE,
I-I'M JUST NOT EXCITED
ABOUT THE DO-IT-YOURSELF
BUSINESS.
OKAY.
IT'S JUST NOT A FIT
FOR ME.
OKAY.
JESSE, YOU WANT A LOAN
THAT GETS CONVERTED TO EQUITY,
OR ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR STRAIGHT EQUITY?
I-I WOULD --
I'M DEFINITELY OPEN
TO A LOAN THAT GETS CONVERTED.
[ LAUGHS ]
I HAVE TO SAY, EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS, LIKE, <i>SO</i> RUDE,
THERE IS SOMETHING
A LITTLE APPEALING
ABOUT WHAT HE'S OFFERING,
SAD TO SAY.
JESSE,
DO YOU WATCH THE SHOW?
I HAVE WATCHED THE SHOW.
OKAY, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYBODY WALK IN THERE
JESSE, I'LL GIVE YOU
$250,000 FOR 15%.
I SAY NO TO THAT OFFER
BECAUSE IN 2015
JESSE, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS WALK OUT WITH A SHARK.
TWO SHARKS ARE WAY BETTER
THAN ONE SHARK
I APPRECIATE THE HELP.
JESSE,
THANK YOU.
JESSE, CONGRATS.
SERIOUSLY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU FAILED.
WAY TO STICK TO YOUR GUNS.
YOU -- YOU ACTUALLY
CAME BACK WITH A --
DIDN'T GET A DEAL.
I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS
INTO A CREDIBLE COMPANY.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD JOB, JESSE.

WHEW! [ EXHALES DEEPLY ]
I DON'T THINK I WAS ABLE
TO GIVE UP ENOUGH OF THE COMPANY
