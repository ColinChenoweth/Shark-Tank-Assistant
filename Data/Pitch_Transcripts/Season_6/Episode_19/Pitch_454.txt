HI, I'M JESSE GENET.
MY COMPANY IS LUMI.
I'M HERE ASKING FOR $250,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 5% OF MY COMPANY.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN IDEA
FOR A T-SHIRT?
OR MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO PRINT A LOGO
ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN PAPER.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT,
WITH THE POWER OF THE SUN,
YOU COULD PRINT BEAUTIFUL,
PERMANENT IMAGERY
ON ANY NATURAL MATERIAL?
LET ME SHOW YOU WHY LUMI
IS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE SEEN.
SIMPLY SNAP AN IMAGE, UPLOAD IT
INTO THE FREE LUMI APP.
THEN PRESS "NEGATIVE," AND IT'LL
TURN YOUR IMAGE INTO A NEGATIVE
THAT YOU CAN SAVE
AND PRINT AT HOME,
OR ORDER FROM US,
AND WE SHIP IT TO YOU.
NOW CHOOSE SOMETHING
TO PRINT ON --
MAYBE AN OLD T-SHIRT
OR A TOTE BAG.
TAKE OUR SUNLIGHT-ACTIVATED
INKODYE,
SNAP THE PACKET,
AND SPREAD IT ON.
NOW TAKE YOUR NEGATIVE...
AND SECURE IT IN PLACE.
JUST 10 MINUTES OUT IN THE SUN
WILL TURN THIS INTO
A BEAUTIFUL, PERMANENT DESIGN.
SO, LET'S SEE
HOW THIS ONE TURNS OUT.
OH, WOW.
SO, THIS IS NOW
A PERMANENT IMAGE.
I JUST NEED TO TAKE THIS, THROW
IT IN THE WASH, AND I'M DONE.
SO, AT LUMI, WE'RE TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHY OUT OF THE DARK ROOM
AND INTO THE SUN.
LUMI CLEARLY HAS
A BRIGHT FUTURE.
WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME?
I HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF SERVICES
THAT I'VE DONE THIS WITH
THAT PROVIDE CLOTHING
OF EVERY NATURE,
INCLUDING OTHER TCHOTCHKES.
I MEAN --
THE -- THE MASSIVE DIFFERENCE
IS THAT THIS IS D.I.Y.
SO, THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE
MOVEMENT HAPPENING,
AND PEOPLE HAVE AN URGE
TO CREATE THINGS AT HOME.
CAN I SEE
THE ONE YOU MADE?
YES.
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
DO THIS?
NO.
SO, IS THIS PROPRIETARY TO YOU?
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON IT?
YES.
THE DYE IS A TRADE SECRET.
A FELLOW IN THE 1950s DEVELOPED
A FORMULA FOR SOMETHING
THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO
ESSENTIALLY WHAT I WAS SEEKING.
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS
TO TRACK DOWN THIS GUY.
WAS HE USING IT AT THAT TIME
FOR HIS OWN BUSINESS?
NO. IT'S DEFUNCT.
AND THEN EVENTUALLY
I CONVINCE HIM THAT IF HE HAS
ANY OLD INVENTORY, THAT I COULD
TAKE IT OVER, BUT IF --
DID YOU BUY IT OUTRIGHT,
OR DOES HE STILL GET A ROYALTY?
HE HAS NOTHING.
I BOUGHT IT OUTRIGHT.
HOW MUCH
DID YOU PAY FOR IT?
[ SIGHS ]
I PAID HIM $50,000.
SO, WHERE
DID YOU GET THAT?
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO, THAT'S WHEN I TOOK
AN ANGEL INVESTMENT.
HE INVESTED 180K AT 10.5%.
YOU TALKED HIM INTO --
HE GAVE YOU $180,000?
YOU HAD NO SALES?
HE'S INVESTED $180,000...
YES.
...AND HE HAS 10.5% EQUITY
OF YOUR COMPANY?
CORRECT.
O'Leary: OKAY, JESSE.
IN THE LAST --
...TELL US WHAT YOUR SALES ARE
THIS YEAR, PLEASE.
YES, IN THE PAST
12 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS,
WE HAVE $1 MILLION IN SALES.
GOOD FOR YOU.
WOW!
O'Leary:
HOW MUCH DID YOU -- HOW MUCH
DID YOU MAKE OFF THE $1 MILLION?
WE ARE NET-POSITIVE 40K,
BUT WE HAVE BEEN RE-INVESTING
THAT WHOLE TIME.
SO, YOU'RE MAKING $1 MILLION
IN SALES.
WHAT ARE
YOUR COST OF GOODS?
WHEN WE SELL DIRECT
ON E-COMMERCE,
OUR MARGINS ARE 91% BLENDED.
WHEN WE SELL
TO WHOLESALERS, 78%.
WE ALSO HAVE EQUIPMENT.
JESSE, I'M NOT CLEAR
WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE SELLING.
OKAY.
YEAH, CAN YOU -- DO YOU HAVE
SAMPLES FOR US TO SEE?
YES. I DO.
SO, THIS IS
OUR SHADOW PRINTING KIT.
THIS IS
OUR SUNFOLD PRINTING KIT.
Herjavec: SO, JESSE,
YOU'RE SELLING THESE KITS
FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.
WE'RE SELLING THE KITS.
WE ALSO SELL THE DYE
IN INDIVIDUAL BOTTLES.
OKAY, SO, HOW DO I BUY THAT
FROM YOU -- JUST ONLINE?
YOU CAN BUY IT ONLINE,
YOU CAN BUY IT IN MICHAELS,
YOU CAN BUY IT AT JO-ANN'S.
SO, OUT OF THE --
WHAT DOES IT COST?
WHAT DOES
WHAT KEVIN'S HOLDING COST?
THAT IS $39.99.
$39.99.
Corcoran:
AND WHAT DO YOU PAY FOR THAT?
$6.49.
Herjavec: HOW MANY T-SHIRTS
CAN YOU MAKE?
SO, YOU CAN DO FOUR,
AND THEN YOU CAN BUY REFILLS
AND DO AS MANY AS YOU WANT.
WHAT'S THE REVENUE GONNA BE
NEXT YEAR?
THE REVENUE NEXT YEAR,
CONSERVATIVELY,
WILL BE $2.5 MILLION.
AND WHERE
DO YOU BASE THAT?
WHY -- WHY DO YOU FEEL --
WHY SUCH A BIG JUMP?
WHY DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE THAT KIND OF GROWTH?
BECAUSE
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, UM,
I'VE DEVELOPED A TRACK RECORD
OF AT LEAST DOUBLING OUR SALES.
HOW BIG DO YOU THINK
YOUR COMPANY CAN GET?
LIKE, HOW MANY PEOPLE
WANT TO MAKE
THEIR OWN T-SHIRT AT HOME?
OH, MY GOSH, I THINK
IT'S ABSOLUTELY,
ASTRONOMICALLY MASSIVE.
"ABSOLUTELY,
ASTRONOMICALLY MASSIVE"?
YES! YES! [ LAUGHS ]
OKAY, I WAS JUST --
I'VE -- I'VE SEEN THAT
IN PROJECTIONS BEFORE.
OKAY.
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE.
I CAN BACK UP
THOSE PROJECTIONS.
OUT OF THAT $28 BILLION
CRAFTING/D.I.Y. SPACE,
ABOUT 18% OF THAT
INVOLVES SOME TYPE OF STAMPING,
TODAY, JESSE, YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO VALUE YOU AT $5 MILLION.
YES.
THAT'S 50 TIMES
YOUR FREE CASH FLOW.
YOU SEE ANY PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU
HOW I ARRIVED AT THE VALUATION.
I JUST ARRIVED AT IT.
IT'S -- IT'S RIDICULOUS.
JESSE,
I-I'M JUST NOT EXCITED
ABOUT THE DO-IT-YOURSELF
BUSINESS.
OKAY.
IT'S JUST NOT A FIT
FOR ME.
OKAY.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
UM, I'M SURE YOU HAVE
A LOVELY BUSINESS HERE.
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.
AND I LOVE YOUR PHOTO KIT,
THE BIG SQUARE ONE...
YES.
...'CAUSE IT'S VISUAL.
YOU GET WHAT IT IS.
THE REST -- IT'S A LITTLE --
IT'S STILL CONFUSING,
AND I'VE BEEN
LISTENING HARD.
YES.
BUT I JUST DON'T
BELIEVE IN IT ENOUGH,
AND I'M A LITTLE UNCERTAIN
ABOUT THE PRODUCT, SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
OKAY, SO, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
BA-BAM!
I...I LIKE YOU.
I DON'T LIKE
THE VALUATION, THOUGH.
SURE.
AHA!
I MEAN, IT'S A VERY RICH ASK --
$250,000.
WELL, BEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER,
LORI -- WAIT.
BEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER,
LET ME MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
AND THEN LORI MAY DECIDE --
HE JUST INTERRUPTED
MY OFFER!
NO, BECAUSE I'M GONNA HELP YOU.
I'M GONNA HELP YOU, OKAY?
YOU MADE
A VERY IMPASSIONED SPEECH.
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA HELP ME?
I'M GONNA -- JUST LISTEN
TO THIS, AND THEN YOU DECIDE
IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE
OR COMPETE, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
READY?
O'Leary:
BEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER,
JUST LISTEN TO THIS,
AND THEN YOU DECIDE
IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE
OR COMPETE, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
READY?
ALL RIGHT, TWO OFFERS --
YOU GET TO CHOOSE
WHICH ONE YOU LIKE.
I'LL OFFER YOU $250,000,
AND HERE'S HOW I VALUED
YOUR COMPANY.
I ASSUMED YOUR $1 MILLION
SHOULD MAKE $100,000 AFTER TAX.
I WOULD PAY
FIVE TIMES THAT MULTIPLE.
OKAY.
SO, IF WE DO IT
THAT WAY...
MM-HMM.
...YOU'RE WORTH
$500,000.
SO, MY $250,000 WOULD BUY
50% OF EQUITY.
BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT VALUATION,
I'LL <i>LEND</i> YOU
$250,000, OKAY...
YES.
...AT AN 8.5% RATE...
MM-HMM.
...FOR 36 MONTHS --
3 YEARS --
MM-HMM.
'CAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY
PAY IT BACK BY THEN
IF YOUR FORECASTS
ARE CORRECT.
YES.
AND I WANT 12.5% EQUITY
TO DO THAT.
THAT'S A VENTURE-DEBT DEAL.
YOUR COMPANY'S IDEAL FOR THAT.
YEAH.
NOW, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THOSE,
OR ARE YOU STUPID
AND GONNA PAY MORE THAN THAT?
OHH!
OHH!
LET ME --
FIRST LET ME EXPLAIN
THAT WE'VE ALREADY PROVEN
OURSELVES VERY CREDIT-WORTHY.
WE TOOK -- THE LAST ONE WE TOOK
WAS ACTUALLY A $110,000 LOAN,
WITH INTEREST, AND WE PAID IT
BACK WITHIN FOUR MONTHS.
THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE --
THE DEBT OFFER.
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE HIM
ANY EQUITY. [ LAUGHS ]
JESSE, YOU WANT A LOAN
THAT GETS CONVERTED TO EQUITY,
OR ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR STRAIGHT EQUITY?
I-I WOULD --
I'M DEFINITELY OPEN
TO A LOAN THAT GETS CONVERTED.
[ LAUGHS ]
I HAVE TO SAY, EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS, LIKE, <i>SO</i> RUDE,
THERE IS SOMETHING
A LITTLE APPEALING
ABOUT WHAT HE'S OFFERING,
SAD TO SAY.
WHY NOT GO
HALF AND HALF?
I'M THE ONLY SHARK
THAT'S A PHOTOGRAPHER.
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ARTISTS
LIKE YOU AND I.
I WILL DO HIS DEAL WITH HIM
IF YOU WILL TAKE THAT DEAL.
I WANT TO --
LOOK, YOU GET
THE QUEEN OF QVC,
AND YOU GET A STARVING ARTIST,
HOLD THE "STARVING."
[ LAUGHTER ]
I -- I DO REALLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO OFFER.
THE IDEA OF HAVING YOU BOTH ON
BOARD WOULD TRULY BE TREMENDOUS.
DO YOU WANT TO SELL HALF
THE COMPANY FOR $250,000?
'CAUSE YOU'RE ONLY WORTH --
THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY ABSURD.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WERE YOU
GONNA COUNTER?
I WOULD SAY...2%,
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT
AS AN EXCHANGE FOR THE LOAN.
2%?
I WOULD LOOK AT IT AN EXCHANGE
FOR THE ADVISORY ROLE.
DO IT FOR 5%
SO WE EACH GET 2.5% EACH,
AND I THINK
WE WOULD DO THAT DEAL.
AND IF YOU DO IT
AS AN EQUITY INVESTMENT,
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT YOU CAME IN ASKING.
I KNOW. [ LAUGHS ]
YOU'RE RIGHT BACK TO --
VERY CLEVER, RIGHT?
YEAH, I-I MEAN,
THAT IS WHAT I ASKED FOR,
AND I DO FEEL IT'S FAIR.
UM, I...I FEEL LIKE
I-I APPRECIATE
YOU GUYS TRYING TO MEET
IN THE MIDDLE ON THAT.
JESSE,
DO YOU WATCH THE SHOW?
I HAVE WATCHED THE SHOW.
OKAY, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYBODY WALK IN THERE
AND, WHEN ASKED
TO NEGOTIATE A PRICE,
GET A DEAL
BY NOT GIVING?
I'M NOT -- I'M --
I'M NOT IN A MOOD TO NOT GIVE,
I'M JUST TRYING
TO WORK OUT SOMETHING
THAT I THINK
WILL WORK FOR MY COMPANY.
DO YOU WANT
A STRAIGHT EQUITY DEAL?
IF THERE WAS
A FAIR EQUITY DEAL THAT --
IF THERE WAS
A LOAN ADDITIONAL,
I WOULD DEFINITELY ADD LIKE
A 2% KICKER, A 2.5% KICKER.
JESSE, I'LL GIVE YOU
$250,000 FOR 15%.
I SAY NO TO THAT OFFER
BECAUSE IN 2015
AND GOING INTO 2016,
I PLAN TO BLOW THIS UP.
AND I BELIEVE THAT I CAN GO
FOR A MUCH LARGER EQUITY ROUND
AT A LATER DATE.
I GET THAT, BUT --
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTNER...
IT'S --
...YOU HAVE TO BE
A PARTNER, TOO.
I UNDERSTAND.
SO, WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE
REALLY ISN'T THAT MUCH.
SOMETHING -- SOMETHING --
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY --
I WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER UP SOMETHING
THAT I THINK COULD BE
REASONABLE, POTENTIALLY.
BUT -- BUT LET'S MAKE IT --
LET'S  OFFER
SOMETHING REASONABLE.
250 -- 250K AS AN EQUITY
INVESTMENT FOR THAT 5%,
BUT THEN ANOTHER 100K
ON TOP OF THAT
AS A REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT
FOR ANOTHER 2%, 7%.
THAT'S NUTS!
FOR ANOTHER 2%?
THAT'S NUTS.
JESSE, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS WALK OUT WITH A SHARK.
TWO SHARKS ARE WAY BETTER
THAN ONE SHARK
FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF REASONS
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.
SO, I THINK WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
IS TAKE THIS OFFER.
LORI AND I WILL SPLIT
THE $250,000 LOAN FOR 8.5%.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID
ORIGINALLY, OKAY?
WE WANT 5% EQUITY --
THAT KEEPS US INTERESTED.
YOU SHOULD DO THAT DEAL.
UM [CLEARS THROAT]
THAT'S -- RIGHT.
AM I WILLING TO OFFER --
AM I WILLING TO GIVE 5%
OF THE COMPANY
FOR A $250,000 LOAN
WHEN I, IN ALL HONESTY,
CAN PROBABLY GET A LOAN
ELSEWHERE FOR THAT AMOUNT?
NOT A CHANCE.
I DEFINITELY CAN.
DO YOU THINK A BANK GIVES YOU
THE VALUE OF A SHARK?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WOULDN'T GET IT --
NO, I WOULDN'T GO TO A BANK
AT THIS STAGE.
I [CLEARS THROAT]
I WOULD SAY --
I WOULD SAY THAT, AT THIS POINT,
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP 5%
OF THE COMPANY FOR A LOAN.
I'M NOT GROVELING.
I'M MR. WONDERFUL,
THE SHARK.
I UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T GROVEL.
I GET WHAT I WANT, ALL RIGHT?
IF I'M NOT GETTING 5%,
I'M OUT.
$250,000, 7%, SAME,
8.5%, 36 MONTHS.
AS A LOAN? I'M --
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A LOAN
FOR 7% EQUITY IN THE COMPANY.
I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE THE HELP.
JESSE,
THANK YOU.
JESSE, CONGRATS.
SERIOUSLY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU FAILED.
WAY TO STICK TO YOUR GUNS.
YOU -- YOU ACTUALLY
CAME BACK WITH A --
DIDN'T GET A DEAL.
I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS
INTO A CREDIBLE COMPANY.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD JOB, JESSE.
SERIOUSLY.
WHEW! [ EXHALES DEEPLY ]
I DON'T THINK I WAS ABLE
TO GIVE UP ENOUGH OF THE COMPANY
TO INTEREST THE SHARKS,
WHICH I UNDERSTAND,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH A LOAN.
