I'M LIZ.
AND I'M BEN.
AND WE'RE
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON.
AND WE MET AND STARTED DATING
IN COLLEGE.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PASSIONATE
ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES,
SPECIFICALLY THE CHALLENGES
FACING WOMEN
LIVING IN
DEVELOPING ECONOMIES.
SO, AFTER UNIVERSITY,
I TOOK A HUGE LEAP OF FAITH
AND MOVED TO UGANDA.
THE GREATEST NEED FOR WOMEN
IN UGANDA
IS EDUCATIONAL
AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.
SO, I DECIDED
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
LIZ ISN'T AFRAID
TO TAKE RISKS.
SHE DOES THINGS
THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T DO,
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SO IMPRESSED BY THAT.
I DECIDED TO QUIT MY JOB
AS A CONSULTANT,
AND TOGETHER,
WE'VE BUILT SOMETHING
THAT WE'RE
SUPER PROUD OF.
HEY, AGNES.
GOOD MORNING.
Hi, Liz and Ben.
OUR GENERATION IS LESS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE BIG BRAND NAME
AND MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE IMPACT
THAT THEIR PRODUCTS HAVE
ON THE WORLD.
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD
TO A GREAT YEAR.
WHEN WE STARTED THE COMPANY,
WE DECIDED WHOLEHEARTEDLY
THAT WE WANTED TO BE
A FOR-PROFIT COMPANY.
WE BELIEVE THAT CREATING
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY
CAN HAVE A MORE LASTING IMPACT
THAN SOME CHARITIES.
I THINK THAT'S
REALLY OUR SWEET SPOT.
WE HAVE SPENT
THE LAST FIVE YEARS
DOING
THE REALLY HARD WORK.
AND NOW WE JUST NEED TO MAKE
A NAME FOR OURSELVES IN AMERICA.
WE BELIEVE THAT
IF EVERY WOMAN IN AMERICA
KNEW ABOUT OUR COMPANY,
WE COULD MAKE A MASSIVE IMPACT
FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS
ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE.
HI, SHARKS.
WE'RE LIZ AND BEN BOHANNON.
WE'RE
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON,
AND WE'RE THE HUSBAND-AND-WIFE
TEAM BEHIND SSEKO DESIGNS.
WE'RE SEEKING $300,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
WITH SSEKO, ONE SANDAL HAS
ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES.
OUR FIRST PRODUCT IS
THE SSEKO RIBBON SANDAL,
A BOHO-CHIC, HAND-CRAFTED,
LEATHER SANDAL
WITH INTERCHANGEABLE
STRAPS
THAT CAN BE TIED AND STYLED
IN HUNDREDS OF WAYS.
FROM A FUNKY CRISSCROSS
TO A CLASSIC FLIP-FLOP,
THIS SANDAL ALLOWS HER
TO CHANGE HER LOOK
DAY TO DAY
AND SEASON TO SEASON.
AND OUR SOPHISTICATED
LEATHER T-STRAP SANDAL
FEATURES
INTERCHANGEABLE ACCENTS
THAT COMPLETELY CHANGE THE LOOK
OF THIS SANDAL
WITH ONE SIMPLE STEP,
MAKING SSEKOS
THE PERFECT SANDALS
FOR JET-SETTERS
AND TRENDSETTERS ALIKE.
SIMPLY CHOSE
YOUR SANDAL BASE,
PICK YOUR STRAPS AND ACCENTS,
AND STYLE YOUR SSEKOS.
BUT WHAT MAKES THIS
CUSTOMIZABLE, VERSATILE SANDAL
EVEN BETTER IS THAT EVERY
SANDAL, STRAP, AND ACCESSORY
YOU PURCHASE
DIRECTLY HELPS
TO EMPOWER AND EDUCATE A WOMAN
IN EAST AFRICA.
YOU SEE, WE'VE DEVELOPED
AN INNOVATIVE WORK-STUDY PROGRAM
THAT EMPLOYS BRIGHT,
PASSIONATE YOUNG WOMEN
WHO COME FROM BACKGROUNDS
OF POVERTY TO MAKE THE SANDALS,
TO EARN MONEY, TO GO TO COLLEGE,
AND PURSUE THEIR DREAMS.
NOW, DON'T JUST
TAKE IT FROM US.
HERE'S A MESSAGE
FROM OUR TEAM IN UGANDA.
[ <i>WOMEN CHEERING</i> ]
THAT WAS GREAT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
NOW, WHICH ONE
OF YOU SHARKS
WANTS TO BE A PART OF BUILDING
A POWERFUL, GLOBAL BRAND
THAT WILL BE KNOWN
FOR MAKING
BEAUTIFUL PRODUCTS
WITH BEAUTIFUL STORIES?
ARE YOU INTO THIS
FOR PROFIT?
YES, WE ARE ABSOLUTELY,
100% A FOR-PROFIT COMPANY.
SO, YOU DONATE WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR REVENUE TO THIS --
SO, WE DO NOT DONATE
ANYTHING.
ALL OF OUR KIND OF
"PHILANTHROPY"
COMES FROM
OUR PRODUCTION SIDE.
YOU'RE MAKING THE SANDALS
IN UGANDA --
THEY MAKE IT.
SO, LITERALLY, INSTEAD OF
MAKING THEM OFFSHORE IN CHINA,
WE'VE SAID, "LET'S BE
REALLY INTENTIONAL
ABOUT WHERE WE MAKE
THE PRODUCT."
WE BELIEVE PASSIONATELY THAT
BUSINESS HAS A POWERFUL ROLE
IN MAKING THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING.
LOVE IT,
BUT IS IT CHEAPER THAN CHINA?
IT IS COMPARABLE
TO CHINA.
WALK US --
CAN WE SEE IT?
YEAH. YEAH.
LET'S -- LET'S TRY SOME --
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
LET'S DEFINITELY --
SO, THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO
SANDAL MODELS THAT WE DO HAVE.
WE ARE EXPANDING INTO
CLOSED-TOED SHOES, AS WELL,
BUT THE SANDALS ARE DEFINITELY
OUR MAIN PRODUCT,
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE
BEEN SELLING TO DATE.
Herjavec:
THEY'RE ONLY FOR WOMEN.
HOW COMFORTABLE IS THAT
TO WEAR?
THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE.
IT'S A
GENUINE-LEATHER BASE,
REAL LEATHER SOURCED
FROM KENYA.
IT HAS A LAYER OF MICRO FOAM
IN THE MIDDLE,
SO IT REALLY FORMS
TO YOUR FOOT
AFTER YOU GET DONE
WEARING IT.
I WEAR THEM ALL DAY,
EVERY DAY.
WE'VE HAD WOMEN
THAT HAVE TREKKED
THROUGH THE AMAZON
IN THEM.
SERIOUSLY? [ LAUGHS ]
WHAT DO YOU SELL
THE SANDALS FOR?
WE SELL ABOUT TWO PAIRS
OF RIBBONS WITH EACH BASE.
SO, THAT'S GONNA RETAIL
FOR RIGHT AROUND $65,
AND THE COST ON THAT --
$65 FOR THIS,
A FLIP-FLOP?
YES.
HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED
WITH UGANDA?
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A TYPICAL THING
SOMEONE WOULD DO.
SO, I WENT TO UNIVERSITY.
I STUDIED JOURNALISM.
I WAS SUPER PASSIONATE
ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES,
AND SO GOT OUT OF COLLEGE,
GOT MY FIRST CORPORATE JOB.
THAT LASTED
FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHILE I WAS SITTING
AT MY CUBICLE,
I BOUGHT A ONE-WAY TICKET
TO EAST AFRICA
AND DECIDED THAT I WAS GONNA
GO JUST BE ON THE GROUND
AND LEARN ABOUT THE ISSUES
THAT WOMEN AND GIRLS FACE THERE.
AND WHY SHOES?
YOU JUST WOKE UP ONE DAY AND
SAID, "LET'S DO A SHOE COMPANY"?
NO, SO,
WHAT HAPPENED WAS
I WAS WORKING AT A
YOUTH-DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION,
MET AN INCREDIBLE GROUP
OF YOUNG WOMEN BASICALLY MY AGE,
BACKGROUNDS
OF EXTREME POVERTY,
AND THEY WERE GETTING READY
TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL,
AND THEY WERE GONNA
GO BACK TO THEIR VILLAGES
FOR THIS
NINE-MONTH BREAK.
IT'S INTENDED
TO ALLOW STUDENTS
THAT ACTUALLY TEST INTO COLLEGE
TO FIND TIME TO FIND A JOB
SO THAT THEY CAN PAY
FOR COLLEGE.
SO, YOU HAVE TO PAY UP FRONT,
OR YOU'RE NOT GOING.
BASICALLY, WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WITH THESE YOUNG WOMEN --
THEY WERE GRADUATING FROM
THIS SECONDARY-SCHOOL PROGRAM,
TESTING INTO COLLEGE,
HAD ALL OF THIS GUSTO AND VISION
FOR WHO THEY WANTED TO BECOME
AND WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO,
WERE GOING BACK TO THEIR
VILLAGES, COULDN'T FIND JOBS.
AND SO I THOUGHT,
"MAN, WHAT IF
LIZ, HOW MUCH MONEY
DID THOSE THREE LADIES NEED
TO GET TO COLLEGE?
COLLEGE IS ABOUT $2,000
TO $3,000 A YEAR, SO --
SO, YOU GUARANTEED THEM
THE $2,000 TO $3,000
BEFORE YOU HAD ANY SALES.
YEAH. YEAH.
I LOVE THAT.
YEAH, SO, THAT'S WHEN --
WHEN I GOT HOME,
ABOUT TWO DAYS LATER,
BEN PROPOSED TO ME,
AND I'M THINKING,
"DO I TELL HIM
"THAT I PROMISED THREE WOMEN
IN AFRICA
I'D PAY FOR THEM
TO GO TO UNIVERSITY?"
HOW MANY WOMEN
ARE THERE NOW?
SO, WE'VE HAD 47 WOMEN WHO HAVE
GONE THROUGH OUR PROGRAM.
WOW.
Herjavec: WOW.
100% OF THE WOMEN
WHO HAVE GRADUATED FROM SSEKO
HAVE GONE ON
TO UNIVERSITY
AND HAVE EITHER GRADUATED
FROM COLLEGE
OR ARE STILL PURSUING
THEIR DEGREES.
GOOD FOR YOU. THAT'S AWESOME.
YOU'RE IN RETAIL. DO YOU HAVE
SALES? WHERE ARE YOU?
Ben: SO, WE'VE DONE $3 MILLION
TO DATE.
THIS YEAR, WE'LL DO
$1.1 MILLION.
AND WHAT WILL YOU MAKE
ON THAT $1.1 MILLION?
2009, '10, '11, AND '12,
WE WERE PROFITABLE.
OKAY, BUT THIS YEAR?
SO, ONCE WE HIT A POINT
IN UGANDA WHERE WE SAID,
"HEY, WE CAN SCALE THIS"...
OH, NICE, LORI.
..."LET'S GO,
LET'S GROW IT,
"LET'S GET INTO
MAJOR DISTRIBUTION,
LET'S GET INTO
MAJOR RETAILERS," WE --
IN 2012,
WE OPENED A DEBT ROUND.
WE DID $250,000 IN DEBT
SO THAT WE COULD GO OUT
AND HIRE OUR FIRST SALESPEOPLE.
AND HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE YOU MAKING NOW?
WE'LL RUN A LOSS THIS YEAR
OF RIGHT AROUND $90,000.
WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEAR?
NEXT YEAR, THE GOAL IS
TO DO $1.9 MILLION.
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
ON THAT?
WE THINK WE'LL LOSE MONEY AGAIN
NEXT YEAR.
WHY ARE YOU LOSING SO MUCH MONEY
ON $1.9 MILLION?
WHY ARE YOU LOSING MONEY
ON $1.9 MILLION?
YEAH. SO, THE --
I MEAN, THE BIGGEST THING --
WE'RE ADD-- WE'RE STILL GONNA
CONTINUE TO ADD SALESPEOPLE.
CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW MUCH SALARY YOU'RE TAKING?
WE'RE RIGHT AROUND $45,000
AS A PACKAGE DEAL RIGHT NOW.
COMBINED?
TOTAL?
YEAH.
SO, HOW DO I GET
TO $3 MILLION...
YEAH.
...FOR SSEKO?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
SO, WE THINK IT'S --
IT'S VERY FAIR TO LOOK AT --
WE'RE EVEN LOOKING
AT LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS --
SO, TAKING
LIKE A $2.7 MULTIPLE
ON OUR REVENUE
FROM LAST YEAR.
YOU WANT TO VALUE IT ON REVENUE
AND NOT PROFIT?
AND THAT'S A --
THAT'S A NORMAL THING,
TO VALUE SOMETHING
ON REVENUE.
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE A BRAND.
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE BRAND SPACE
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING --
BUT YOU'RE NOT A BRAND. I'VE
NEVER HEARD OF YOU TILL NOW.
WELL, YOU WILL.
LAST YEAR ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD A MOST ENDEARING COUPLE
HERE WHO OWNED A BUSINESS
NAMED GRACE AND LACE.
THEY MAKE THESE ADORABLE LITTLE
LACE LINERS FOR YOUR BOOTS.
Ben: MM-HMM.
IT'S AN
INTERESTING PARALLEL.
THEIR PHILOSOPHY WAS
THEY BELIEVED IN HELPING PEOPLE,
AND THEIR INTENTION WAS TO TAKE
WHATEVER PROFITS THEY HAD
AND SPEND HALF OF THAT PROFIT
IMMEDIATELY ON HELPING PEOPLE.
THEY SOLD
$1 MILLION WORTH OF SOCKS
WITHIN A WEEK
OF "SHARK TANK."
IT'S EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER,
AND THEY WILL HAVE
$10 MILLION IN SALES.
THAT'S AWESOME.
BUT HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE
THAT DISTURBS ME --
THEY WERE <i>HYPER-FOCUSED</i>
ON PROFIT FIRST.
THEY WERE FOCUSED
ON CHARITY SECOND.
NOW THEY, FORTUNATELY, HAVE
BUILT THREE ORPHANAGES IN INDIA.
YEAH. YEAH.
BUT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE $400,000
ON $40,000.
YEAH. WITH --
I'M A HAPPY INVESTOR.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE.
IT'S VERY HARD TO BUY
INTO SOMEONE'S PHILOSOPHY
IF THERE ARE PROJECTED LOSSES
WITHOUT CLARITY AS TO HOW
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO PROFIT.
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE
MY NEXT GRACE AND LACE.
YEAH.
BUT I'M SORRY TO SAY
I'M OUT.
THANKS, BARBARA.
THANKS, BARBARA.
HERE'S WHAT
I WILL SAY --
WE ARE MORE DRIVEN
TO MAKE MONEY
AND TO MAKE
THIS BUSINESS WORK
THAN WE WOULD BE
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT.
GUYS, LOOK, I DON'T QUESTION
YOUR PROFIT MOTIVATION.
IT'S THERE.
IT'S OBVIOUS.
WHAT I LOOK FOR
ARE CERTAIN KEYWORDS
THAT TELL ME
HOW REALISTIC YOU ARE,
BECAUSE,
AS ENTREPRENEURS,
YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS REALISTIC,
RIGHT?
YEP.
YOU LIE TO YOURSELF.
YOU GET ALL EXCITED.
YOU GET ALL FIRED UP.
YEAH.
BUT AT SOME POINT,
YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY
THE BILLS, RIGHT?
YEAH, WE WERE
TOP-5 SOCIAL ENTERPRISES
BY <i>BLOOMBERG</i> MAGAZINE.
I MEAN,
WE'RE A SOCIAL INNOVATION.
WE WERE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE, LIKE --
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE ACTUALLY
MAKING MY POINT.
ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU'VE
BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR, RIGHT?
YEP.
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'VE HIRED TO SELL,
AND THAT'S ONLY GOTTEN YOU
TO $1.1 MILLION IN SALES.
YEP.
RIGHT?
I JUST DON'T SEE
THE CAUSE AND EFFECT,
AND I SEE A LOT
OF SELF-PROMOTION
THAT DOESN'T GET ME
FROM HERE
TO WHERE I THINK
YOU GUYS WANT TO GO.
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANKS, MAN.
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE NOT WORTH
$3 MILLION BY <i>ANY</i> MEASURE.
I'M SORRY.
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
SHOE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD.
THEY ALL TRADE PRETTY WELL
IN THE SAME RANGE,
LOTS OF COMPETITION.
I THINK YOU'RE WORTH SOMEWHERE
AROUND $700,000, ALL-IN.
YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE ME
HALF THE COMPANY.
UH-OH.
Narrator: TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
LIZ AND BEN ONLY HAVE THREE MORE
CHANCES TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR THEIR INTERCHANGEABLE SANDAL
COMPANY, SSEKO.
I THINK YOU'RE WORTH SOMEWHERE
AROUND $700,000, ALL-IN.
YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE ME
HALF THE COMPANY.
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET TO A DEAL,
SO I'M OUT.
WE ALL HAVE
DIFFERENT EXPERTISE HERE.
I'M REALLY GOOD
AT TAKING A SMALL COMPANY
AND MAKING IT BIG
IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
WHEN YOU'RE THIS SMALL,
YOU WANT TO INVEST
<i>AFTER</i> THE SALES COME IN.
YOU WANT TO INVEST
TO <i>SUPPORT</i> THE SALES,
NOT INVEST <i>AHEAD</i>
OF THE SALES.
YOU'RE TELLING ME, "I HAD TO
INCREASE MY SALES COSTS BY 30%
TO GET 20% MORE IN SALES AT SUCH
A SMALL AMOUNT OF $1 MILLION."
MM-HMM.
I DON'T SEE
HOW YOU'RE GONNA SCALE
WITHOUT
BUYING YOUR WAY THERE.
GREAT CAUSE...BUT I'M OUT.
Greiner:
I LOVE THE MISSION.
I LOVE THE LOOK -- REALLY CUTE.
BUT I PUT IT ON,
AND I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY
WITH IT BEING COMFORTABLE ON ME
BECAUSE THE RIBBON CAN CUT IN.
DEPENDING ON
WHICH WAY YOU DO IT,
IT CAN CUT INTO YOUR FOOT.
SO, I'M JUST SAYING,
ME PERSONALLY,
I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY
WITH THE RIBBON STYLE.
I'M SURE, FOR A LOT OF WOMEN,
THIS IS COMFORTABLE.
YOU'VE SOLD A LOT.
BUT FOR ME, IT WASN'T.
AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR MISSION,
BUT I DON'T THE PRODUCT,
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
BYE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.
Ben: WE DEFINITELY THINK
THE SHARKS MISSED OUT.
THEY MISSED OUT ON A COMPANY
THAT'S CHANGING THINGS,
A COMPANY
THAT'S GONNA GROW,
AND A COMPANY
THAT'S GOING TO BE PROFITABLE,
UM, AND A COMPANY
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD
A LOT OF FUN
BEING A PART OF.
Narrator: IN SEASON 5, JOHN,
SAL, AND ANTHONY MADE A DEAL
WITH LORI GREINER FOR THEIR
PRODUCT, THE PAINT BRUSH COVER.
LORI, WELCOME
TO THE FAMILY.
[ GASPS ] YAY!
AH, CRAP. WHAT?!
SORRY, BARBARA.
THAT IS GREAT.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
WHEN I MADE MY DEAL, I TOLD THEM
I WORK WITH LIGHTNING SPEED.
THERE IT IS.
[ Chuckling ]
OH! LOOK AT THAT.
AND I KEPT MY PROMISE.
I GOT THEM INTO 2,000 HOME DEPOT
STORES JUST LIKE THAT.
REMEMBER THIS THING?
UH-OH.
I DO REMEMBER
THIS THING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
I SAID TO THE GUYS WAS,
"WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE
THE PACKAGING."
WE MADE IT A BOLDER COLOR.
WE CHANGED THE GRAPHICS
COMPLETELY.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT YOUR PACKAGING POPS,
THAT PEOPLE WALK BY, THEY STOP,
AND THEY BUY IT.
NOT ONLY ARE WE
IN HOME DEPOT NATIONWIDE.
WE'RE EVERYWHERE
WE NEED TO BE.
Caputo: LORI'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL
IN HELPING US LAND DEALS
WITH ALL
THE MAJOR RETAILERS,
INCLUDING ACE HARDWARE
AND SHERWIN-WILLIAMS.
John:
ALL OUR RETAILERS COMBINED,
WE'RE IN OVER 14,000 STORES
NATIONWIDE.
I THINK WE NEED TO GO TALK
SOME MORE BUSINESS.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
OUR BUSINESS HAD DONE
$35,000 IN SALES.
IN 9 MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $1.5 MILLION,
WITH ANOTHER $1 MILLION TO COME
IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.
CAN I GET ANOTHER
100 PALLETS TODAY?
All: YEAH!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
ALL RIGHT!
Sal: BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
WE WERE JUST THREE GUYS
WORKING OUT
OF JOHN'S GARAGE.
NOW WE'RE A COMPANY.
WE HAVE 18 EMPLOYEES.
WE HAVE OUR OWN OFFICE,
AND WE HAVE A HUGE WAREHOUSE.
WE'RE NOT JUST
A PAINT BRUSH COVER ANYMORE.
WE'VE NOW INTRODUCED OUR SECOND
PRODUCT, THE ROLLER COVER.
IT'S QUICKLY BECOMING
JUST AS POPULAR
AS THE PAINT BRUSH COVER.
"SHARK TANK"
WAS A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE,
AND WE'RE LIVING PROOF
THAT THREE GUYS WITH A DREAM
AND AN IDEA COULD GO A LONG WAY.
Together: COVER UP!
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A PRODUCT
THAT COULD TURN A HOBBY
INTO A LUCRATIVE PROSPECT.
HELLO, SHARKS.
Cuban: C.C., I THINK
YOU'RE STARTING TO REALIZE
WHAT A LOT OF ENTREPRENEURS
RUN INTO.
IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
TO GROW A BUSINESS.
AND I CAN TELL
THAT YOU'RE RELENTLESS,
WHICH IS A GOOD THING.
BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES
RIGHT NOW --
IT'S STILL MORE PRODUCT
THAN A COMPANY --
FROM WHAT YOU'VE PRESENTED
SO FAR, I DON'T REALLY SEE IT
AS A COMPANY
THAT'S REALLY GONNA SCALE.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE WAY
TO SCALE IS LICENSING.
I KNOW, MR. WONDERFUL,
THAT'S YOUR FORTE.
I LOOK AT THIS WAY -- IT'S
A PRODUCT, NOT A COMPANY YET.
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
ALL THE CHALLENGES
OF GETTING DISTRIBUTION.
RETAIL IS A VERY VEXING
AND CHALLENGING BUSINESS
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
PAY FOR THE INVENTORY,
HAVE TO GUESS
THE FASHION RIGHT,
AND GUESS THE NUMBER
OF EACH SIZE.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT, BUT IT'S
THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE DOING IT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $80,000,
ZERO EQUITY.
I DON'T TAKE ANY EQUITY
IN THE COMPANY.
I'M GOING TO GET $10 A UNIT
IN PERPETUITY.
IT'S REALLY A BET ON YOU.
THANK YOU FOR THAT OFFER.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE,
BUT I THINK,
AS MY COMPANY IS GROWING,
I DON'T WANT TO SIPHON CASH
AWAY FROM IT.
