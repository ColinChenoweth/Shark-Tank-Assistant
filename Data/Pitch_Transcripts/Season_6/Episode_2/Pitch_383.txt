OF COURSE WE MADE YOU
THE MAVERICKS COURT...
I LIKE THAT.
WITH A PRIVATE PLANE
TO GET YOU THERE.
WITH A PRIVATE PLANE.
OF COURSE.
Robert and Lori: WOW.
BARBARA, OUR ROOMINATORS THOUGHT
THAT A SWANKY MANHATTAN CONDO
WOULD BE PERFECT FOR YOU.
I HOPE THEY'RE CHEAPER THAN
I PAY FOR THEM THERE.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND, MR. WONDERFUL,
WE'VE ALL HEARD
YOUR ICE CREAM SHOP STORY.
AH.
SO WE -- OUR ROOMINATORS HELPED
US BUILD YOU AN ICE CREAM SHOP.
LET'S SEE, KEVIN.
WHAT DOES IT DO?
THIS IS THE ICE CREAM STORE
I GOT FIRED IN,
SO I'M GONNA SET THIS
ON FIRE NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN, LORI, OUR ROOMINATORS
HELPED US MAKE YOU A QVC SET.
AND ALL THESE CREATIONS
HAVE A CIRCUIT IN THERE,
SO IF YOU PRESS
THE RED BUTTON,
IT WILL ACTIVATE IT.
AND, ROBERT, WE KNOW YOU LOVE
RACING CARS.
I DO.
SO THEY HELPED US MAKE YOU
A RACETRACK.
THANK YOU!
CAN I SEE ONE OF THE PACKAGES
SO I CAN SEE
HOW IT'S PACKAGED?
OH, YES. OH, WAIT --
Lori: COOL.
Robert: DOES THE CAR GO AROUND?
YOU CAN PUSH IT AROUND.
[ LAUGHS ]
RR...
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU.
WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT
FROM LEGOS?
[ LAUGHS ]
THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS ALIVE AND WELL!
Mark: I INVESTED IN LANI
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE
THAT $100,000 TURN INTO
$20 MILLION.
AND THE BEST PART IS, THERE'S
A SHOT THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN.
SHE'S THAT GOOD.
THIS IS THE NEW PACKAGING.
Lani: THE "SHARK TANK"
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
"SHARK TANK" HAS GIVEN ME
AN OPPORTUNITY
THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL NEVER GET,
AND I WILL FOREVER BE
GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
THAT'S HYSTERICAL!
Robert: OH, THAT IS HILARIOUS!
BARBARA AND MR. WONDERFUL,
WOULD YOU PLEASE JOIN US?
BARBARA.
YEAH.
BARBARA, PLEASE.
WELCOME, WELCOME, LOVEBIRDS.
I'D LIKE YOU TO TURN
TO FACE EACH OTHER
JUST A LITTLE BIT,
IF YOU WOULD.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ERIC WILLIAMS,
CREATIVE DIRECTOR
AT KRONOS GOLF.
AND I'M PHILLIP LAPUZ,
FOUNDER AND DESIGNER
AT KRONOS GOLF.
WE'RE SEEKING $150,000
FOR A 15% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
WE'RE AN INDIE PUTTER COMPANY
THAT MANUFACTURES
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE PHRASE
"DRIVE FOR SHOW
AND PUTT FOR DOUGH."
PUTTING ACCOUNTS FOR HALF
THE SHOTS OF AN AVERAGE GOLFER.
SO WHY ARE WE BLOWING OUR MONEY
ON DRIVERS
AND SHODDY PUTTERS?
THAT IS WHERE KRONOS
COMES IN.
WE MILL OUR PUTTERS DOWN
TO A 1/1,000th OF AN INCH
TO MAKE SURE OUR PUTTERS
ARE PERFECTLY BALANCED.
WE START OUT WITH
A SOLID BLOCK OF STEEL
AND MILL IT
FOR OVER TWO HOURS,
TRANSFORMING IT FROM STAGE 1,
A SOLID BLOCK OF STEEL,
TO STAGE 2,
A ROUGHLY MILLED PUTTER,
TO STAGE 3,
A MORE REFINED MILLED PUTTER.
IT'S A SLOW,
LABOR-INTENSIVE PROCESS,
BUT IT'S THE RIGHT WAY
TO MAKE A WELL-BALANCED PUTTER.
FROM THERE, EACH ONE
IS INDIVIDUALLY HAND-WORKED,
INCLUDING DELICATE DE-BURNING,
POLISHING, AND PAINTING,
ALL THE WHILE PRESERVING
THAT CRITICAL BALANCE.
THE TRUTH IS, THERE'S
NO PUTTER OUT THERE
THAT'LL MAKE YOU BETTER
OVERNIGHT,
BUT OURS WILL HELP YOU PUTT
MORE CONSISTENTLY,
AND THAT MIGHT BE
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WINNING AND LOSING.
PLUS THEY'RE SUPER SEXY.
SO LET'S GET THE DEVIL
ON THE DANCE FLOOR
AND GIVE THESE PUTTERS
A TRY.
KEVIN, CAN WE ASK YOU
TO COME ON UP HERE?
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET YOU A BALL.
NOW, ROBERT, NOTE
HOW I'M HOLDING THE CLUB.
SHOULD WE DUCK, KEVIN?
I'M FEELING ONE WITH THE BALL
AT THIS MOMENT.
WATCH THIS GO IN.
WAH, WAH!
Mark: OHH!
Barbara: VERY CLOSE.
A LITTLE SLOW.
PHIL, YOUR PREMISE WAS
AN AWFUL GOLFER LIKE KEVIN
WOULD BE BETTER
WITH YOUR PUTTER.
HERE'S WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.
A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT THEY CAN BUY THEIR WAY
INTO GOLF
OR ANOTHER SPORT,
WHATEVER IT IS.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT
OF TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE THEM,
AND THE APPRECIATION
FOR THE PRACTICE
AND THE WORK THAT GOES INTO IT
ENDS UP BEING LOST.
FOR THAT REASON,
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE --
OUR PUTTERS ARE SIMPLISTIC,
AND THEY REFER TO OLDER TIMES.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
THEY'RE FAIRLY SIMPLE?
Lori: YES.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO
THE MILLING PROCESS.
BUT HOW DO YOU GET
YOUR STORY OUT?
YEAH, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?
DEAL WITH
THE DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM.
OKAY, I'LL ANSWER THAT.
I WANT TO BUY A KRONOS,
AND I'M SITTING IN NEW YORK.
RIGHT.
WHERE DO I GO?
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WE WENT
TO THE PGA SHOW
AND WE GOT DISTRIBUTION
FOR JAPAN AND SCOTLAND.
BUT NOBODY STATESIDE
WAS INTERESTED?
THEY'RE INTERESTED, BUT THERE'S
THAT ISSUE OF PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT THEY NEED APPROVAL
FROM A PRO --
IT'S A PROVEN MODEL.
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE SELL
GOLF PRODUCTS.
Lori: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
THIS YEAR TO DATE,
WE'VE DONE $260,000,
AND WE'VE DONE 95% OF THAT
TO JAPAN.
THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE CRAFTSMANSHIP.
SO WHY IS IT WORKING IN JAPAN?
DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN DISPLAYS?
NO, IT'S THIS --
NO, IT'S A BRAND.
THERE'S A DIFFERENT PSYCHE
IN JAPAN THAN IN AMERICA.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AMERICA.
THEY LOOK FOR THAT VALIDATION
IN A PRO PLAYER.
IN JAPAN, THEY HAVE
A LONG HISTORY OF ART,
AND THE DELICACY THAT
GOES INTO CREATING THINGS.
AND ON THAT LEVEL,
THEY APPRECIATE
WHAT WE CREATE
AT FACE VALUE.
THEY TAKE THEIR --
HOW MUCH -- HOW MUCH
DOES IT COST
RELATIVE TO A NORMAL PUTTER?
SO, OUR CHEAPEST PUTTER
SELLS FOR $500.
Lori and Barbara: WOW!
OH, MY GOODNESS.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
YOU'RE REALLY A PREMIUM --
CAN I SEE ONE?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET'S DISCUSS THE NAME
FOR A SECOND.
OKAY.
I HAPPEN TO BE AN EXPERT
IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY, OKAY?
[ LAUGHTER ]
EXCELLENT.
THANK YOU. SO YOU KNOW
THAT KRONOS --
HE TOOK A SICKLE
AND HE CASTRATED HIS FATHER
AND THREW THEM
INTO THE OCEAN.
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
NOW, WHAT WOULD THAT HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH A PUTTER?
SO, KRONOS' TIME,
HIS REIGN,
WAS CALLED THE GOLDEN AGE.
WE WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF GOLF.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WEARING
THIS ATTIRE.
Robert: HANG ON A SEC.
EVERYTHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
ONCE I FEEL IT --
AND LOOK AT THE WEIGHT OF IT.
I MEAN, IT'S --
IT'S A LOT BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER STANDARD PUTTER.
THANK YOU.
BUT WHY COULDN'T YOU GET
DISTRIBUTION HERE IN THE U.S.?
WE COULD ADVERTISE
AND SAY
THAT WE'VE GOT THE GREATEST
PUTTERS, BUT IT DOESN'T --
YOU HAVE TO GIVE A FREE PUTTER
TO EVERY SINGLE PRO SHOP.
THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.
Robert: SO CAN YOU -- CAN YOU --
OR AT LEAST TO THE PEOPLE
ON THE PGA.
EXACTLY.
YES, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
TO GET A PRO.
IT'S JUST, HOW MUCH DO YOU
WANT TO PAY THEM, RIGHT?
ERIC, $500 IT SELLS FOR
AT RETAIL.
TELL ME WHAT IT COSTS YOU
TO MAKE
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SELL IT
TO THE STORES AT.
SURE. COST ROUGHLY IS ABOUT
$120 PER CLUB TO MAKE.
BUT WE SELL THEM WHOLESALE
FOR AROUND --
OUR CHEAPEST ONE IS $200
TO $230.
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU
RAISED SO FAR?
NONE. IT'S REALLY MY MONEY.
I WORKED IN CONSULTING
BEFORE THIS, AND I --
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU
PUT INTO IT?
WE HAVE ABOUT $100,000
INTO IT.
Mark: GUYS, LET ME
GET THINGS ROLLING HERE.
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF DALLAS NATIONAL?
NO.
I HAVE NOT.
IT'S ONE OF THE NICEST COURSES
IN THE COUNTRY.
IT OPENED IN DALLAS
PROBABLY TEN YEARS AGO,
AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS --
"YOU GOTTA JOIN,
YOU GOTTA JOIN."
I JOINED TEN YEARS AGO.
I'VE NEVER BEEN.
[ LAUGHS ]
'CAUSE I HATE GOLF.
Eric: PERFECT.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
OH, MAN.
[ LAUGHS ] BUT I WISH YOU GUYS
THE BEST, AND CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU GUYS.
ONE THING THAT WE TOUCHED ON --
CAN I INTERJECT HERE?
SURE.
YES.
I, AMONG EVERYBODY UP HERE,
SHOULD LOVE THIS SPORT
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
BECAUSE IT SAVED MY MARRIAGE.
IT GETS RID OF MY HUSBAND
EVERY WEEKEND.
[ LAUGHING ]
BUT I HATE GOLF.
I COULDN'T IMAGINE
SUPPORTING IT.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
THANKS.
SO, LAST YEAR, WE DID
SOMETHING IN JAPAN
WHICH HELPED OUR SALES
A LOT.
BUT HOW -- YOU HAVEN'T SOLVED
THE DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM.
FOR THE U.S.
THERE ARE CASES WHERE
SOMETHING CATCHES FIRE
IN GOLF,
AND EVERYBODY BUYS IT.
SURE.
I MEAN, LIGHTNING STRIKES,
AND MAYBE IT COULD STRIKE YOU,
BUT IT'S A LONG SHOT.
Phillip: THANK YOU.
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT
UPSCALE CRAFTSMANSHIP,
IF THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT,
THEN YOU HAVE A NICHE MARKET
THAT'S GONNA GO FOR THAT.
I THINK JAPAN
IS THE WAY TO GO,
BECAUSE JAPAN IS TELLING YOU,
"WE LOVE IT."
I'M OUT.
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOU GUYS.
WHAT MOTIVATED YOU GUYS TO WANT
TO START YOUR OWN BUSINESS?
I, UH...
[ EXHALES ]
UM...
I'M ENGAGED, UH, TO A --
[ SNIFFLING, CRYING ]
[ Voice breaking ]
I'M ENGAGED TO A --
I'M ENGAGED, AND MY FIANCÈE
LIVES IN JAPAN,
AND SHE CAN'T COME OUT HERE
UNLESS I MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
[ SNIFFLES ]
[ BREATHES UNEVENLY ]
I COULD HAVE JUST CONTINUED
MY JOB AS A CONSULTANT,
MAKING FINE MONEY...
BUT THIS IS MY DREAM.
[ CRYING ]
WHY CAN'T SHE COME HERE
UNLESS THIS WORKS?
YEAH, WHY?
BECAUSE...I WANT THIS
TO BE STABLE, AND --
YOU CAN'T AFFORD HER
TO COME HERE.
[ SNIFFLES ]
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY.
IT COULD WAIT, BUT...
I MEAN, I'M --
OH, "WOE IS ME,"
LIKE, I CAN'T GET MARRIED,
BUT...
IT'S LIKE, DO I HAVE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
MY COMPANY OF MY DREAMS
AND MY FIANCÈE?
SHE'S SITTING THERE WAITING.
IT'S BEEN TWO YEAR-- TWO YEARS
SINCE I PROPOSED TO HER.
AND...
AT THAT TIME, I WAS WORKING
IN CONSULTING,
AND HER PARENTS APPROVED.
AND NOW THEY DON'T APPROVE.
THEY THINK I'M CRAZY.
[ SNIFFLING ] AND --
BECAUSE OF THE -- BECAUSE
YOU STARTED A BUSINESS?
YEAH. I -- I THINK
IN THEIR CULTURE,
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT
MORE CONSERVATIVE
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY VALUE
SOMEONE WHO GOES
NINE-TO-FIVE JOB OR --
SO CULTURALLY IT'S HARD.
THEY DON'T SEE THE VALUE --
YEAH. [ SNIFFLES ]
[ CRYING ]
IT'S MOVING,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.
[ CRYING ]
I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO SIT TONIGHT
AND WRITE HER PARENTS
A THANK-YOU NOTE.
AND YOU OUGHT TO START
LIKE THIS --
"THANK YOU FOR THE INSULTS,
"FOR NOT THINKING I'M WORTHY
ENOUGH FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.
WATCH ME NOW,
AND WATCH WHAT I DO."
THEY'RE NO BETTER MOTIVATION
IN THE WORLD
THAN SOMEBODY WHO INSULTS YOU.
THOSE PARENTS ARE GUARANTEEING
YOUR SUCCESS.
AND IF YOUR FIANCÈE
DOESN'T MARRY YOU,
I WILL MARRY YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MOVE TO JAPAN QUICKLY!
PHILLIP, I WILL --
YOUR STORY REALLY MOVED ME,
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
IT'S PAINFUL TO LISTEN
TO THAT.
ASK -- ASK HIM TO PUT
HIS MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS.
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.
Lori: THAT'S RIGHT.
IF YOU WERE CRYING,
HELP HIM OUT.
I WAS. I WAS MOVED
BY THAT STORY,
BUT NOW I'M BACK IN REALITY.
YOU KNOW...
I'D LOVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO THIS,
BUT I THINK IT'S --
IT'S A VERY, VERY
DIFFICULT TASK.
YOU DON'T WANT TO LET EMOTIONS
MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS,
AND I DON'T, AND THAT'S
WHAT'S KEPT ME TRUE
AS A GREAT INVESTOR.
I'M OUT.
YOU HAVE ONE SHARK LEFT.
PHILLIP, ERIC, YOU HAVE
ONE SHARK LEFT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
[ CLICKS TONGUE ]
LOOK, I --
IN THE SIX YEARS
WE'VE BEEN UP HERE,
HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED.
PEOPLE THAT SUCCEED IN LIFE
TEND TO HAVE A NEED
FOR SOMETHING GREATER
THAN THEMSELVES.
I HAVE A HUGE CHIP
ON MY SHOULDER.
THE GUYS ALWAYS MAKE FUN
OF ME.
AND IT ALWAYS GOES BACK
TO THE NEED
TO IMPROVE MY PARENTS' LIFE.
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN DRIVE,
AND THAT'S NEVER GONNA GO AWAY.
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA WORK
A LITTLE HARDER
AND -- AND KEEP GOING.
BUT IT TAKES TIME.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE
THE CONSUMER MARKET LIKE THIS.
THIS IS GONNA TAKE TIME.
THAT'S THE THING
THAT WE HAVE.
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE,
AND I'M WILLING TO PUT IN.
AND I THINK --
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU MAKE
AN INVESTMENT
BECAUSE YOU SEE
A TIPPING POINT.
MY ONLY POINT TO YOU IS
THERE'S A TIPPING POINT,
AND IT'S FAR AWAY.
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME
TO RECOUP THIS.
$150,000 FOR 35%.
[ GASPS ] YOWIE.
DO YOU MIND IF WE TAKE
A SECOND TO TALK ABOUT IT?
SURE.
[ SPEAKING JAPANESE ]
SO --
[ CONTINUES IN JAPANESE ]
ARE THEY SPEAKING JAPANESE?
YES.
[ CONTINUES IN JAPANESE ]
[ SPEAKING JAPANESE CONTINUES ]
I-I -- WE'D LIKE
TO COUNTER AT 25%.
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE MIDDLE.
I'LL DO $150,000 FOR 30%.
[ SPEAKING JAPANESE ]
WE --
WE JUST HAVE ONE LAST
QUESTION FOR YOU.
DO YOU WANT YOUR PUTTER NOW
OR LATER WITH YOUR NAME
ENGRAVED ON IT?
'CAUSE WE'D LOVE TO DO
A DEAL WITH YOU.
Barbara: AH, GREAT!
ALL RIGHT!
I'LL -- I'LL TAKE
ALL OF THEM.
THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ]
GREAT JOB, GUYS.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH.
I HOPE THE NEXT TIME WE SEE
YOU, YOU'RE MARRIED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW DO YOU SAY "GOOD JOB"
IN JAPANESE?
[ SPEAKS JAPANESE ]
[ SPEAKS JAPANESE ]
[ REPEATS IN JAPANESE ]
Lori and Eric:
[ REPEATING IN JAPANESE ]
OH, MAN, THAT WAS CRAZY!
Phillip: IT'S GONNA FEEL
SO GOOD
TO FINALLY WIN OVER
THE APPROVAL
OF MY FIANCÈE'S PARENTS.
TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
A SHARK ON YOUR SIDE
THAT'S ROOTING FOR YOU --
THAT FELT REALLY GOOD.
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I CAN
CONQUER THE WORLD.
[ CHUCKLES ]
