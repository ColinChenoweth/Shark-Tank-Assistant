OF COURSE WE MADE YOU
THE MAVERICKS COURT...
I LIKE THAT.
WITH A PRIVATE PLANE
TO GET YOU THERE.
THAT'S HYSTERICAL!
Robert: OH, THAT IS HILARIOUS!
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ERIC WILLIAMS,
CREATIVE DIRECTOR
AT KRONOS GOLF.
THAT IS WHERE KRONOS
COMES IN.
WE MILL OUR PUTTERS DOWN
TO A 1/1,000th OF AN INCH
TO MAKE SURE OUR PUTTERS
ARE PERFECTLY BALANCED.
WE START OUT WITH
A SOLID BLOCK OF STEEL
OKAY, I'LL ANSWER THAT.
I WANT TO BUY A KRONOS,
THERE'S A DIFFERENT PSYCHE
IN JAPAN THAN IN AMERICA.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AMERICA.
THEY LOOK FOR THAT VALIDATION
IN A PRO PLAYER.
IN JAPAN, THEY HAVE
A LONG HISTORY OF ART,
THANK YOU. SO YOU KNOW
THAT KRONOS --
SO, KRONOS' TIME,
HIS REIGN,
WAS CALLED THE GOLDEN AGE.
WE WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF GOLF.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WEARING
THIS ATTIRE.
Robert: HANG ON A SEC.
EVERYTHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
ONCE I FEEL IT --
ERIC, $500 IT SELLS FOR
AT RETAIL.
TELL ME WHAT IT COSTS YOU
TO MAKE
Phillip: THANK YOU.
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT
UPSCALE CRAFTSMANSHIP,
IF THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT,
THEN YOU HAVE A NICHE MARKET
THAT'S GONNA GO FOR THAT.
I THINK JAPAN
IS THE WAY TO GO,
BECAUSE JAPAN IS TELLING YOU,
"WE LOVE IT."
I'M OUT.
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOU GUYS.
WHAT MOTIVATED YOU GUYS TO WANT
TO START YOUR OWN BUSINESS?
I, UH...
[ EXHALES ]
UM...
I'M ENGAGED, UH, TO A --
[ SNIFFLING, CRYING ]
[ Voice breaking ]
I'M ENGAGED TO A --
PHILLIP, I WILL --
YOUR STORY REALLY MOVED ME,
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
IT'S PAINFUL TO LISTEN
TO THAT.
ASK -- ASK HIM TO PUT
HIS MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS.
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.
Lori: THAT'S RIGHT.
IF YOU WERE CRYING,
HELP HIM OUT.
I WAS. I WAS MOVED
BY THAT STORY,
BUT NOW I'M BACK IN REALITY.
YOU KNOW...
I'D LOVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO THIS,
BUT I THINK IT'S --
IT'S A VERY, VERY
DIFFICULT TASK.
YOU DON'T WANT TO LET EMOTIONS
MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS,
YOU HAVE ONE SHARK LEFT.
PHILLIP, ERIC, YOU HAVE
ONE SHARK LEFT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
[ CLICKS TONGUE ]
LOOK, I --
IN THE SIX YEARS
WE'VE BEEN UP HERE,
HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED.
PEOPLE THAT SUCCEED IN LIFE
TEND TO HAVE A NEED
FOR SOMETHING GREATER
THAN THEMSELVES.
I HAVE A HUGE CHIP
ON MY SHOULDER.
THE GUYS ALWAYS MAKE FUN
OF ME.
Phillip: IT'S GONNA FEEL
SO GOOD
TO FINALLY WIN OVER
THE APPROVAL
OF MY FIANCÈE'S PARENTS.
TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
A SHARK ON YOUR SIDE
THAT'S ROOTING FOR YOU --
THAT FELT REALLY GOOD.
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I CAN
CONQUER THE WORLD.
