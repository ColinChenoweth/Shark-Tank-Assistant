HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ALICE BROOKS.
AND MY NAME IS BETTINA CHEN,
AND WE'RE FROM PALO ALTO,
CALIFORNIA.
OUR COMPANY IS ROOMINATE,
AND WE ARE SEEKING
$500,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 5% OF OUR COMPANY.
OUR MISSION IS TO EMPOWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF FEMALE
ENGINEERS AND INNOVATORS.
SHARKS, WE'D LIKE YOU TO THINK
BACK TO YOUR CHILDHOODS.
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR FAVORITES TOYS?
AND DID ANY OF THOSE TOYS
INFLUENCE YOUR SUCCESS TODAY?
BARBARA, WHAT IF INSTEAD OF
MAKING A REAL ESTATE DEAL
IN A BOARD GAME, YOU WERE ABLE
TO BUILD YOUR OWN HIGH-RISE?
AND, LORI, INSTEAD OF DRAWING
AN IDEA WITH A CRAYON,
WHAT IF YOU WERE ABLE TO BUILD
A PROTOTYPE?
IMAGINE HOW YOUNG
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
WHEN YOU WERE ISSUED
YOUR FIRST PATENT.
INTRODUCING ROOMINATE,
TOYS TO INSPIRE THE NEXT
GENERATION OF INNOVATION.
ROOMINATE IS A NEW
AND REVOLUTIONARY
WIRED BUILDING SYSTEM
FOR GIRLS AGE 6 AND UP.
LET'S SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.
FIRST YOU START
BY BUILDING THE STRUCTURE,
WITH THREE STORIES, BALCONIES,
EVEN SPIRAL STAIRCASES.
AND THE BEST PART ABOUT
ROOMINATE IS
THE WORKING CIRCUIT.
WIRE UP EVERYTHING
FROM SPINNING WINDMILLS
TO MERRY-GO-ROUNDS,
EVEN ELEVATORS.
Robert and Lori: [ CHUCKLE ]
AND MAKE IT ALL LIGHT UP.
WE ALREADY HAVE A COMMUNITY
OF THOUSANDS OF GIRLS AND BOYS
WHO WE CALL ROOMINATORS.
OUR ROOMINATORS
MAKE AMAZING CREATIONS
THAT WE NEVER WOULD HAVE
DREAMED OF MAKING,
EVERYTHING FROM
THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
TO A CAR WASH,
EVEN A ROCKET SHIP.
WE ALSO HAVE SOME
SPECIAL ROOMINATES
TO PASS OUT TO EACH OF YOU.
OUR ROOMINATORS HELPED US
CREATE SOME.
TERRIFIC.
SO FOR YOU, MARK,
Alice: THIS IS ALL ABOUT
OPEN-ENDED PLAY.
SO WE GIVE THEM INSPIRATION
AND WE GIVE THEM IDEAS,
BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S UP
TO THE KIDS
TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT
TO BUILD.
HOW DID YOU GUYS COME UP
WITH THIS?
WELL, I STUDIED
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AT M.I.T. AND STANFORD.
AND I STUDIED
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AT CALTECH AND STANFORD.
SO WE GOT TO STANFORD,
THE TWO OF US,
AND WE BECAME FRIENDS
RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE
WE WERE TWO OF THE ONLY WOMEN
THERE IN ENGINEERING.
AH.
AND THAT GOT US TALKING,
YOU KNOW.
WE REALIZED THAT OUR
COMMON THREAD WAS THAT
WE'D BOTH BEEN INSPIRED
BY THINGS
THAT WE PLAYED WITH
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER.
Barbara: MM.
AND FOR ME, IT WAS
WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD.
I ASKED MY DAD, "CAN SANTA CLAUS
BRING ME A BARBIE THIS YEAR?"
AND HE SAID "NO."
AND INSTEAD I GOT MY OWN SAW.
AH!
SO I BUILT DOLLS AND DOLLHOUSES
OUT OF WOOD AND NAILS.
AND I JUST --
THAT JUST STARTED MY LOVE
OF ENGINEERING RIGHT THERE.
DID YOU HAVE A NATURAL
INTEREST TO BUILD THINGS,
OR DID YOUR DAD
PUSH YOU THAT WAY?
I THINK THAT ALL KIDS ARE OPEN
TO ALL DIFFERENT SORTS
OF THINGS.
THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW
FOR GIRLS
IS THAT WE'RE NOT EXPOSING
THEM TO MORE OPTIONS.
SO WE'RE MISSING OUT ON HALF
OF THE POTENTIAL
PRODUCT DESIGNERS,
COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS RIGHT NOW.
HMM.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US
THAT WE CAN GET GIRLS
DOING THESE SORTS OF THINGS.
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WE HAVE $1.7 MILLION
IN SALES TO DATE.
AMAZING.
THIS -- THIS CALENDAR YEAR?
IN JUST A LITTLE MORE
THAN A YEAR AND A HALF.
SO THIS YEAR, WHAT WILL YOU
DO IN SALES?
THIS YEAR WE WILL DO
$5 MILLION IN SALES.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALREADY
AT A MILLION.
WOW!
THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING.
Kevin: BY THE WAY, OTHERS HAVE
TRIED TO DO THIS
IN THIS SPACE AND FAILED
MISERABLY,
SO I WANT TO HEAR HOW YOU GOT
DISTRIBUTION.
SO, AT TOYS "R" US,
WE'LL BE IN ALL 596 STORES
TO START.
RADIO SHACK,
WE'LL BE IN 1,500 STORES.
WE HAVE DEALS WITH
BARNES &amp; NOBLE,
MICHAELS, NORDSTROM.
WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING
TO CANADA THIS YEAR.
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE BREAKDOWN
OF SALES PER STORE.
WHAT IS YOUR TURNAROUND?
HOW MANY DO YOU SELL?
SO WE'LL BE IN THOSE STORES
STARTING IN THE FALL.
Mark: YEAH, YOU MENTIONED THESE
ARE ALL ORDERS THAT ARE COMING.
IN THE FALL.
SO YOU HAVEN'T GONE IN YET.
YOU'VE SOLD $1.7 MILLION.
WHERE ARE YOU MAKING
THOSE SALES?
SO WE'RE IN OTHER
ONLINE CHANNELS.
UM, AMAZON IS A BIG ONE
FOR US.
BASICALLY, LAST YEAR WE WERE
PRIMARILY ONLINE,
AND LAST YEAR WE DID
$540,000 IN SALES.
ARE YOU GETTING ANY SALES
FOR BOYS, THOUGH?
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T --
Both: YES.
WE DO HAVE BOYS
PLAYING WITH IT, TOO.
IS IT GENDER-SPECIFIC?
ON YOUR OPENING COMMENTS,
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A PRODUCT TARGETED
TO DEVELOPING YOUNG GIRLS.
YES. WE'VE MADE IT
GENDER-SPECIFIC
IN THAT YOU CAN START BY
MAKING A DOLLHOUSE.
BUT BOYS HAVE COME TO US
AND BOYS ARE PLAYING WITH IT.
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?
SO WE HAVE
MULTIPLE PRODUCTS.
THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE
IN FRONT OF YOU NOW,
THAT'S THE STUDIO.
THAT SELLS FOR $29.99.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU TO MAKE?
IT COSTS US $8.75 TO MAKE.
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT
TO THE STORE FOR?
SO WITH RETAILERS,
IT RANGES FROM $16.50 TO $24.
I'M LOOKING AT YOUR SALES
THIS YEAR.
LET'S SAY $5 MILLION. THAT MEANS
ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS
WILL BE TIED UP IN INVENTORY.
YOU MUST HAVE BROUGHT ON SOME
INVESTORS BY THIS POINT...
OF COURSE.
...TO CARRY THAT, RIGHT?
YES. WE'VE TAKEN $850,000
IN INVESTMENT,
SO WE OWN THE REST OF IT.
THE VALUATION WAS AT $6 MILLION.
Kevin: $6 MILLION.
I MEAN, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
REMARKABLE.
THE TOY INDUSTRY'S
BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE.
I MEAN, EVERYBODY ELSE
HAS FAILED. EVERYBODY.
BUT I WONDER WHAT
THE SELL-THROUGH'S GOING TO BE.
THAT'S GONNA BE THE QUESTION.
YOU REALLY PUT THE WHOLE COMPANY
ON THE LINE THEN, DIDN'T YOU?
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
SELL THROUGH, YOU'RE DEAD.
WE'LL BE PAID REGARDLESS,
AND WE ALSO HAVE A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR BUYERS.
LOOK, CONGRATULATIONS
FOR GETTING
THIS AMOUNT OF DISTRIBUTION.
BUT NOW I HAVE TO BALANCE --
DO I PAY
BECAUSE I'M SO ENAMORED
WITH THE GROWTH POTENTIAL
BEFORE I GO THROUGH ONE
SEASONAL CYCLE?
SO IN THE TOY INDUSTRY,
YOUR WHOLE FUTURE
IS THIS HOLIDAY.
SO IF YOU DON'T SELL THROUGH,
YOU'RE SCREWED.
FEMALE-BASED BUSINESSES.
Alice: THAT'S GREAT.
SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOUNG WOMEN TODAY,
THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN DO
AND BE ANYTHING.
SO I'D BE HAPPY TO GO IN ON IT
WITH MARK.
$500,000 FOR 5% EQUITY STAKE,
IF MARK IS WILLING
TO GO IN ON IT.
YOU'D GET TWO BIG SHARKS,
ONE IN THE TECH SPACE,
ONE IN THE INVENTOR SPACE,
AND WE'LL HAVE THIS ON QVC
WITHIN FOUR MONTHS.
YES. YOU HAVE A DEAL.
GREAT.
DONE.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NO, THEY'LL LOVE IT.
THEY'LL LOVE IT.
AND SMART -- GOOD GIRLS.
Alice and Bettina: THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANKS.
Robert: THANK YOU.
Both: [ LAUGHING ]
WE'RE IN SHOCK.
WE FEEL AMAZING RIGHT NOW.
I MEAN, WE'RE GOING TO BE
WORKING WITH MARK <i>AND</i> LORI.
IT COULDN'T GET BETTER
THAN THAT. WE'RE SO EXCITED.
MARK DID IT 'CAUSE HE'S TOO RICH
AND TOO NUTS
AND TOO MUCH IN LOVE
WITH HIS KIDS.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BUSINESS.
AND PLUS WE CAN MAKE THEM
SUCCESSFUL.
I DON'T GET IT.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT.
OKAY, GUYS,
A MOMENT OF SILENCE
FOR THAT MONEY THAT JUST DIED.
ABSOLUTELY.
I'M WITH YOU THIS TIME.
[ LAUGHS ] OH, MY GOD.
Robert: OHH.
I WOULD LOVE TO ACCEPT
YOUR OFFER.
SINCE MAKING A DEAL
ON "SHARK TANK"
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,
BUSINESS HAS BEEN
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
I'M HERE TODAY
IN NEW YORK CITY
BECAUSE I'VE JUST SIGNED
A MAJOR DEAL
WITH DESTINATION MATERNITY,
THE LARGEST MATERNITY
RETAILER IN THE WORLD.
THEY HAVE DECIDED TO CARRY
SIMPLE SUGARS
IN ALL 575 LOCATIONS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE
WITH YOU GUYS TODAY.
I'VE BEEN INVITED
TO TRAIN THEIR SALES TEAM
AND OFFICIALLY LAUNCH
SIMPLE SUGARS IN THEIR STORES.
YOU WANT TO SCRUB AROUND
UNTIL YOU FEEL
THE SUGAR START TO MELT.
AT OUR LAST UPDATE,
WE HAD JUST REACHED
A MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES.
NOW, ONLY A YEAR LATER, WE'VE
REACHED $3 MILLION IN SALES,
AND OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS
WE'RE EXPECTING
TO DO AN ADDITIONAL $4 MILLION.
HEY, LANI.
HEY, MARK.
SHOWING MARK THAT HE MADE
THE RIGHT INVESTMENT
IS SOMETHING THAT DRIVES ME
EVERY DAY.
I HAVE A CHECK
FOR $200,000.
