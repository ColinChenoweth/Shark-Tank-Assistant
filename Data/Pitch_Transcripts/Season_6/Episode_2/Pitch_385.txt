MY NAME IS TIGGS CHIRIGA,
HELLO, SHARKS!
MY NAME IS TIGGS.
I LIVE IN MOORESVILLE,
NORTH CAROLINA,
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING, BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
THAT'S NOT A MATING CALL.
THAT'S THE SOUND MY WIFE MAKES
EVERY TIME SHE DISCOVERS
A COFFEE STAIN
ON OUR FURNITURE.
WHEN I'M DISTRACTED, I DON'T
HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY
TO SEARCH FOR A COASTER
JUST TO PUT MY CUP DOWN.
SO THE INEVITABLE HAPPENS --
A COFFEE STAIN MAGICALLY
APPEARS UNDER MY CUP.
YOU'RE MY MAN, TIGGS.
THAT'S AWESOME.
SO GIVE US THE NUMBERS, TIGGS.
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE IT?
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
WHERE <i>DO YOU</i> SELL IT?
TIGGS, I ACTUALLY USED TO BE
IN THE GLASS BUSINESS
WAY, WAY, WAY BACK WHEN.
WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT
THAT BUSINESS
WAS YOU HAVE TO BUY
IN MASSIVE QUANTITY
BECAUSE OF THE PRICE POINTS.
FOR IT TO GET DOWN TO $4,
WHAT QUANTITY
DO YOU NEED TO BUY?
SO OUR ORDER QUANTITY'S
19,500 UNITS.
WOW.
WHAT WAS THE RETAIL
PRICE GONNA BE?
$19.99.
HERE'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
Robert: [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ]
LET ME EXPLAIN ONE THING,
THOUGH.
MY OPTION IS,
WHEN I GO TO STORE,
I CAN BUY A PORCELAIN MUG
OF RELATIVELY SIMILAR QUALITY
TIGGS, THE DOWNSIDE IS
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE COMPETING
GOOD LUCK, TIGGS.
GOOD LUCK, TIGGS.
[ SIGHS ]
I JUST WANT TO DO BETTER,
YOU KNOW?
YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY
LIKE THAT,
