MY NAME IS TIGGS CHIRIGA,
AND I LIVE IN MOORESVILLE,
NORTH CAROLINA,
WITH MY WIFE DIANA
AND MY 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
AND I GOT ANOTHER BABY
ON THE WAY.
GO! GO!
I CAME TO THE STATES, UH,
ALL THE WAY FROM ZIMBABWE
14 YEARS AGO.
I EARNED
A BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP,
AND I FACED A LOT
OF CHALLENGES,
BUT ULTIMATELY I WORKED MY WAY
TO AN M.B.A.
RIGHT NOW, I'M A CLERK
AT A POST OFFICE,
BUT I REALIZE THERE'S SOMETHING
GREATER OUT THERE FOR ME,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M FOLLOWING
MY DREAM
AND STARTING MY BUSINESS.
I DID A FANTASTIC JOB
LAUNCHING MY PRODUCT,
BUT NOW THAT EVERYBODY'S
INTERESTED,
I DON'T HAVE THE CAPITAL
OR THE INVENTORY
TO MEET THE DEMAND.
[ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ]
THE SUCCESS OF MY PRODUCT
MEANS A BETTER FUTURE MY FAMILY,
AND I KNOW
A DEAL WITH THE SHARKS
CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
[ GIGGLES ]
HELLO, SHARKS!
MY NAME IS TIGGS.
I LIVE IN MOORESVILLE,
NORTH CAROLINA,
AND I'M THE FOUNDER OF
THE FLOATING MUG COMPANY.
I'M SEEKING $75,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 15% OWNERSHIP
IN MY BUSINESS.
THIS IS QUITE SIMPLY
THE SEXIEST MUG YOU'LL EVER
LAY YOUR EYES ON.
OF COURSE, KEVIN, YOUR MUG
IS A CLOSE SECOND.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL DESIGNER,
BUT I HAD A SCREECHING PROBLEM,
AND I NEEDED A SOLUTION.
YOU SEE, MY WIFE MAKES
A VERY PARTICULAR SOUND,
AND IF YOU'LL LET ME,
I'M GONNA TRY AND REPRODUCE
THAT SOUND FOR YOU.
IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS...
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING, BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
THAT'S NOT A MATING CALL.
THAT'S THE SOUND MY WIFE MAKES
EVERY TIME SHE DISCOVERS
A COFFEE STAIN
ON OUR FURNITURE.
WHEN I'M DISTRACTED, I DON'T
HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY
TO SEARCH FOR A COASTER
JUST TO PUT MY CUP DOWN.
SO THE INEVITABLE HAPPENS --
A COFFEE STAIN MAGICALLY
APPEARS UNDER MY CUP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I KNEW AT THAT MOMENT
I WAS A DEAD MAN WALKING.
BUT THERE'S GOOD NEWS.
I NO LONGER HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THAT DEATHLY SOUND.
THE FLOATING MUG
IS THE ULTIMATE MARRIAGE
BETWEEN A MUG AND A COASTER,
AND TOGETHER,
IT'S THE PERFECT
ELEGANT SOLUTION.
I BROUGHT SOME SAMPLES
FOR YOU GUYS.
I'VE GOT THESE
IN SPECIAL COLORS.
THAT'S ADRENALINE WHITE.
Robert: OOH.
THIS IS HERO WHITE.
THAT'S A PERPETUAL WHITE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE MY MAN, TIGGS.
THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT'S THE FINAL WHITE,
AND THIS IS HOME TEAM WHITE.
THERE YOU GO.
Kevin: [ LAUGHS ]
DOES THE BOTTOM BREAK OFF
A LOT?
HOW DOES THIS HOLD UP
OVER TIME?
WELL, THIS IS A VERY
WELL-MADE PRODUCT.
IS THERE A PIECE OF METAL
IN HERE?
NO. THIS IS
ALL PORCELAIN.
THE WHOLE THING?
WHOLE THING IS PORCELAIN.
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THEM NOW,
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
UM, SO IF I GIVE YOU
SOME CONTEXT,
I STARTED --
I LAUNCHED THIS ON --
IT'S NEVER GOOD
WHEN IT'S NOT A NUMBER.
RIGHT. YEAH.
OUR FIRST YEAR SALES
WAS $105,000.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
THAT'S GREAT!
YEAH, THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL.
WHO DID YOU SELL THEM TO?
OUR BIGGEST CUSTOMER WAS
A DISTRIBUTOR
THAT WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH.
SO GIVE US THE NUMBERS, TIGGS.
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE IT?
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
WHERE <i>DO YOU</i> SELL IT?
ALL RIGHT, SO --
AND WHERE DO YOU MANUFACTURE IT?
ORIGINALLY, WE STARTED
MANUFACTURING
IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC,
BUT IT COST ME
$12 TO LAND THIS
FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC.
INDIVIDUALLY?
INDIVIDUAL MUGS.
SO WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
SO RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN
SELLING IT FOR $29.99.
WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT PRICE.
[ EXHALES ]
BUT WE FOUND A REALLY GREAT
ITALIAN-BASED MANUFACTURER
WHO'S WORKING WITH US TO NOW
START PRODUCING THIS IN CHINA.
SO WE'VE GONE FROM
A $12 LANDED
TO NOW WE'RE AT $4 LANDED.
TIGGS, I ACTUALLY USED TO BE
IN THE GLASS BUSINESS
WAY, WAY, WAY BACK WHEN.
WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT
THAT BUSINESS
WAS YOU HAVE TO BUY
IN MASSIVE QUANTITY
BECAUSE OF THE PRICE POINTS.
FOR IT TO GET DOWN TO $4,
WHAT QUANTITY
DO YOU NEED TO BUY?
SO OUR ORDER QUANTITY'S
19,500 UNITS.
WOW.
WHAT WAS THE RETAIL
PRICE GONNA BE?
$19.99.
HERE'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
Robert: [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ]
LET ME EXPLAIN ONE THING,
THOUGH.
MY OPTION IS,
WHEN I GO TO STORE,
I CAN BUY A PORCELAIN MUG
OF RELATIVELY SIMILAR QUALITY
FROM SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
6 AND 9 BUCKS.
NOW, I CAN ALSO GET A COASTER
FOR ABOUT 80 CENTS.
SO WOULD THE AVERAGE CONSUMER
PAY 100% PREMIUM
FOR THE FLOATING MUG?
AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
TO THAT,
AND CERTAINLY YOU HAVEN'T
PROVEN IT IN THE MARKET YET.
SO MY -- MY RESPONSE
TO THAT, KEVIN, UM --
YOU CAN SAY THAT FOR ANYTHING.
AT WHAT POINT DOES
A $10 PAIR OF SUNGLASSES
BECOME A $200 PAIR
OF SUNGLASSES?
WHEN IT'S REALLY,
REALLY SPECIAL.
IS THIS SPECIAL ENOUGH?
THIS IS JUST A PRODUCT.
WHAT I WANT YOU
TO FOCUS ON IS THE CONCEPT.
THIS IS OUR PROOF OF CONCEPT
FOR BEVERAGE PRODUCTS
THAT HAVE INTEGRATED
COASTER FUNCTIONALITY.
LIKE?
WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU
A PROTOTYPE I'M WORKING ON.
SO JUST TO GIVE YOU
AN IDEA,
THAT'S A DRINKING GLASS.
AND WHAT'S THE BENEFIT?
IT'S A BUILT-IN COASTER.
SO AS IT SWEATS,
EVERYTHING GETS CAUGHT
IN THAT RESERVOIR,
AND IT'S GOT A WALL,
SO AS YOU DRINK, IT'S NOT
GONNA SPILL ON YOU.
Robert:
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON IT?
ON THE GLASS IT'S PENDING.
ON THIS IT'S ISSUED.
Kevin: WHEN MARKETS CLOSE
AT 4:00 IN NEW YORK,
I ALWAYS HAVE
A VODKA AND LEMONADE
WITH LOTS OF ICE
IN A TALL GLASS.
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS
IT SWEATS LIKE CRAZY,
'CAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF ICE.
CAUSES CONDENSATION ON MY DESK.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
NOW, THAT'S A PROBLEM.
I WOULD BE WILLING
TO PAY A PREMIUM
TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM,
KNOWING I HAVE TO FACE IT
WITH CERTAINTY EVERY DAY.
KEVIN, WHILE THIS
MIGHT BE A NICHE PRODUCT,
THIS GIVES ME CREDIBILITY.
IT SHOWS YOU THAT I CAN
DELIVER A WORLD-CLASS PRODUCT.
TIGGS, THE DOWNSIDE IS
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE COMPETING
WITH A STANDARD MUG
AND A 50-, 80-CENT COASTER.
IT'S NOT A TASK I WANT TO TRY
AND DO,
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
MAKE ANY MONEY DOING IT.
OH, KEVIN,
BEFORE YOU KEEP TALKING --
HA!
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO STOP ME.
I HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS
AS AN INVESTOR
EVERY DAY IN THE SHARK TANK.
OKAY.
I LOOK FOR THE PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE
FOR THE HIGHEST RETURNS,
'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY
DISCIPLINED INVESTOR HERE.
MAYBE YOU CAN GET AN EMOTIONAL
CONNECTION GOING WITH BARBARA,
WHO LOVES TO SPEND MONEY
WHEN SHE STARTS TO CRY.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN,
BUT FOR ME, THIS ISN'T
GONNA WORK.
I'M OUT.
SO, HERE'S MY CONCERN
WITH THIS.
I THINK THE MARKET FOR PEOPLE
THAT ARE GONNA PAY
A PREMIUM FOR SOMETHING THAT
DOESN'T LEAVE A COFFEE STAIN
IS ME, KEVIN MAYBE,
AND A COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE.
BUT I DON'T SEE IT
AS A WIDE ACCEPTABLE PRODUCT
THAT'LL DRIVE
YOUR PRICE POINTS DOWN.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE
A HIGH MOTOR.
YEAH.
AND YOU GRIND.
MY CHALLENGE IS THAT
THE HIGH MOTOR APPROACH TO THIS
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE WEB.
POUNDING IT THROUGH
A WEB SITE,
AND SELLING A THOUSAND
MAKES YOU $17,000.
SELLING 5,000 MAKES YOU
$85,000.
IN MY MIND,
THE STRATEGY WAS WRONG.
YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
THE HIGH MOTOR APPROACH
WITH THE WEB, 'CAUSE YOU CAN
CONTROL YOUR OWN DESTINY THERE.
AND BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T,
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
BARBARA, I NEED YOU HERE.
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS ITEM
IS A ONE-TIME PURCHASE,
AND I THINK IT'S A GIFT ITEM.
I DON'T ENVISION SOMEONE
BUYING A SET OF SIX.
OKAY.
I HOPE I'M WRONG,
'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
SADLY, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
ONE SHARKETTE LEFT.
Lori: SO, FOR ME,
LOOKING AT THIS,
I THINK IT SHOULD BE
A LOWER PRICE POINT,
BECAUSE I THINK IT MAKES
YOUR JOB EASIER
IF MORE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD IT.
TO ME, HIGH END FOR THIS
IS LIKE $8.99,
$9.99 MAX.
THIS IS THE ONE
THAT I THINK IS REALLY CLEVER.
I DON'T LIKE THE SILICONE BAND.
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU
COULD TAKE THIS
AND HAVE IT ALL ONE
INTEGRATED BLOWN PIECE
SO THAT YOUR CATCH HERE
IS MADE OUT OF GLASS,
ALL INTEGRATED AS ONE
SO IT'LL STILL LOOK
SLEEK AND BEAUTIFUL,
TO ME, THIS IS YOUR HERO.
THIS IS THE MONEY.
I THINK BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A LOT OF STUDYING TO DO
IN FIGURING THIS OUT,
YOU'RE NOT READY YET.
SO...I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK, TIGGS.
GOOD LUCK, TIGGS.
[ SIGHS ]
I JUST WANT TO DO BETTER,
YOU KNOW?
YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY
LIKE THAT,
AND YOU DON'T CAPITALIZE ON IT,
IT HURTS.
UH, BUT IT'S JUST GONNA MOTIVATE
ME TO DO BETTER.
