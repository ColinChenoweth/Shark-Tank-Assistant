HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JAMES CASS.
AND MY NAME
IS ADRIAN GONZALEZ.
WE ARE FROM LAS VEGAS,
NEVADA,
AND OUR COMPANY IS
THE WEDDING WAGON.
WE ARE SEEKING AN INVESTMENT
OF $125,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
THE WEDDING WAGON
IS THE WORLD'S FIRST
CASUAL AND AFFORDABLE
MOBILE WEDDING SERVICE.
RIGHT NOW, COUPLES
THAT WANT TO GET MARRIED
REALLY ONLY HAVE
A COUPLE OF OPTIONS --
EITHER A BORING CEREMONY DOWN
AT THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE,
OR A BIG, COMPLICATED,
AND COSTLY WEDDING
AT A CHURCH OR A HOTEL.
AND THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN.
AT THE WEDDING WAGON,
INSTEAD OF THEM GOING
TO THE CHAPEL,
THE CHAPEL COMES TO THEM.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THE COUPLE CALLS US,
AND WE MEET THEM
AT THE LOCATION OF THEIR CHOICE
THAT MEANS THE MOST TO THEM.
WE BRING AN OFFICIANT
AND A PHOTOGRAPHER
FOR A FUN AND MEMORABLE
CEREMONY.
SO LET'S SAY, FOR INSTANCE,
MR. WONDERFUL,
YOU WANTED TO RENEW YOUR VOWS
OF SHARK LOVE --
[ LAUGHTER ]
WITH BARBARA.
Mark: AW!
EW!
IT WOULD BE SIMPLE.
LET'S DO THAT
IN THE PARKING LOT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AGAIN?
YOU'D PICK UP THE PHONE,
YOU'D CALL US,
AND WE WOULD MEET YOU
AT A LOCATION OF YOUR CHOICE.
AND WE CAN'T THINK OF
A BETTER ONE BUT SHARK TANK.
Barbara: OH!
LET'S SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW HE KISSES
AT THE END.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HELLO!
James: BARBARA, NO CEREMONY
WOULD BE COMPLETE
WITHOUT FLOWERS.
Barbara: THANK YOU.
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
Adrian: HERE WE GO.
KEVIN, I'LL BE YOUR RING BEARER
AND YOUR BEST MAN.
OKAY. I ALSO NEED A LAWYER
FOR A PRENUP RIGHT NOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY
TO WITNESS AND TO CELEBRATE
THE RENEWAL...
I OBJECT!
...OF SHARED LOVE
BETWEEN MR. WONDERFUL
AND THE REAL DEAL.
NOW HOLD HER HAND GENTLY
JUST LIKE THAT.
NOW LOOK INTO HER EYES LOVINGLY
AND REPEAT AFTER ME --
Lori: [ GIGGLES ]
"I PROMISE TO ALWAYS BE
A NICE SHARK..."
I PROMISE TO ALWAYS BE
A NICE SHARK.
"AND TO NEVER INTERRUPT YOU
WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING."
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLEASE REPEAT AFTER ME --
"I PROMISE TO ALWAYS BE
A NICE SHARK..."
I ALWAYS PROMISE TO BE
A NICE SHARK.
"AND TO UPHOLD ALL OF OUR
DEALS FOR ALL TIME."
AND NEVER DO A DEAL WITH YOU
EVER AGAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
I WILL CRUSH YOU LIKE
THE COCKROACH YOU ARE.
AHH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOUR
SHARK LOVE RENEWED,
AND YOU MAY SEAL YOUR COMMITMENT
WITH A KISS.
Mark and Robert: DO IT!
LAST TIME I DID THIS,
I TURNED TO STONE.
HA!
[ LAUGHS ]
YAY!
Mark: OOH!
Robert and Lori: AWW!
VERY SWEET! NICELY DONE.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING
SUCH GREAT SPORTS.
JUST A MOMENT.
HE NEEDS A COVER HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT.
THAT IS ADORABLE!
OH!
SHARKS,
WE LAUNCHED OUR BUSINESS
IN THE WEDDING CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD,
AND YOU PROBABLY CAN
FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT'S AT.
[ Singsongy ] LAS VEGAS!
James: ? VEGAS ?
Both: WHO'S READY TO SAY "I DO"
TO THE WEDDING WAGON?
WOW!
WHAT DOES IT COST TO GET MARRIED
IN YOUR WAGON?
YOU KNOW, WE STARTED OUR
BUSINESS -- LAUNCHED AT $99.
AND HOW MANY CAN YOU BANG OUT
IN A DAY?
WE DO ABOUT -- WOULD YOU SAY
SIX TO EIGHT, ADRIAN, A DAY?
SIX TO EIGHT A DAY.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR?
$243,000.
WHOA!
WOW!
COME ON.
THAT'S WITH A 2-PERSON
OPERATION.
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU WOULD HAVE SAID THAT.
BUT WHAT'S THE EXPANSION PLAN?
IS THIS GONNA WORK
IN OTHER CITIES,
OR IS VEGAS THE ONLY PLACE
YOU CAN DRIVE UP
IN A VAN AND GET MARRIED?
I'M VERY GLAD YOU ASKED
THAT QUESTION,
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY, VERY
EXCITING TIME
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WEDDING WAGON.
WE ACTUALLY SOLD
THE LAS VEGAS WEDDING WAGON
TO NEW OWNERS LAST YEAR
SO THAT WE COULD DEVOTE
OUR TIME AND ATTENTION
TO LAUNCHING
THE FRANCHISE COMPANY, WHICH
IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY.
REALLY?
YES, WE ENVISION
A LOS ANGELES WEDDING WAGON,
A MIAMI WEDDING WAGON.
YOU DID $240,000 IN SALES.
WHAT DID YOU SELL IT FOR?
WE SOLD THE WEDDING WAGON,
THE LAS VEGAS VERSION,
FOR $120,000.
DID YOU SELL THE RIGHTS
TO ALL OF LAS VEGAS
FOR $125,000
FOR THE WEDDING WAGON?
WE DID, YES.
THAT'S IT. SO YOU CAN'T
REESTABLISH...
CORRECT.
A WEDDING WAGON THERE,
AND THAT'S --
Mark: YEAH, BUT IT'S WORSE
THAN THAT, KEVIN.
YOU OWNED THAT, RIGHT?
AND YOU PRETTY MUCH HAD
THE WHOLE GAME TO YOURSELF.
YOU COULDN'T FIND ENOUGH DEMAND
IN THE WEDDING CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD
TO GET TO A SECOND TRUCK?
WE DID ACTUALLY HAVE
A SECOND WAGON.
WE HIRED ANOTHER TEAM.
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT
SUDDENLY OUR TIME
WAS BEING TAKEN WITH,
"SO-AND-SO CALLED OUT SICK,"
AND WE REALIZED
THAT AN EMPLOYEE DOESN'T HAVE
THE SAME COMMITMENT AS AN OWNER.
NO, NO, ADRIAN, COME ON.
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. YOU CAN'T --
IF THEY WERE MAKING YOU MONEY,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
SOLD THAT OFF
FOR HALF OF YOUR SALES.
NOW YOU GOT NOTHIN'.
I'M OUT.
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA CHARGE
FOR A FRANCHISE?
OUR FRANCHISE FEE
IS $25,000.
[ GASPS ]
OHH! NEVER!
ANYBODY CAN GET A VAN
AND THEN DO JUST WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.
TO ME, YOU DON'T HAVE
SOMETHING SALABLE.
I'M OUT.
IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE TO ME.
YOU'VE GOT A VIABLE BUSINESS.
IF I TOOK SOMETHING
FROM ZERO TO $125,000,
I WANT TO RIDE THAT THING
AS LONG AS I CAN.
YOU -- YOU'RE -- IN EFFECT,
YOU'RE GETTING INTO
A NEW BUSINESS...
CORRECT.
...THAT'S UNPROVEN.
I'M OUT.
NORMALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS
SOMEBODY COMES IN WITH
A SUCCESSFUL MODEL --
IN THIS CASE, IN LAS VEGAS.
RIGHT.
THEY THEN TAKE THE FRANCHISEE
POTENTIAL,
BRING THEM TO VEGAS, SAY,
"LOOK. LOOK AT OUR BUSINESS.
LOOK HOW IT'S WORKING.
LOOK AT THE MONEY WE'RE MAKING,"
RIDE AROUND IN THE TRUCK
FOR A DAY, GET A SENSE OF IT.
"BY THE WAY, SIGN HERE
FOR $25,000."
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
VERY STRANGE.
YOU SOLD YOUR MODEL BUSINESS,
SO NOW YOU ONLY HAVE,
"IT WORKED IN VEGAS.
"LOOK, LOOK, THERE'S
THE TRUCK WE USED TO OWN
BEFORE WE SOLD IT." THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL.
I THINK I'VE JUST WOKEN
INTO A NIGHTMARE.
TERRIBLE PITCH,
<i>AND</i> I'M MARRIED TO BARBARA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M OUT.
WHEN I WAS STANDING UP THERE
MARRYING KEVIN,
I THOUGHT THIS IS --
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WANT MY $99 BACK!
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GREATEST
GIMMICK IN THE WORLD.
WHETHER IT BE IN LAS VEGAS,
NEW YORK CITY,
THE IDEA YOU COULD CALL UP
OR JUST GO ONLINE,
BOOK YOUR WEDDING,
MARRY SOME SUCKER, IS GREAT.
Mark: THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT YOU GAVE AWAY
YOUR SHOW-AND-TELL.
IT REALLY IS SUCH A GREAT MODEL.
BREAKS MY HEART YOU SOLD IT OUT.
AND IF YOU STILL HAD
YOUR ORIGINAL ONE,
I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN
WITH BOTH FEET
AND BOTH HANDS CLAPPING.
BUT I'M OUT, SADLY.
THANK YOU, BARBARA.
YEAH.
UNDERSTOOD. UNDERSTOOD.
THANK YOU, GUYS,
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
TAKE CARE NOW.
THANK YOU FOR THE FANTASY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU GOT IT.
Robert: OR THE NIGHTMARE.
BEING MARRIED TO KEVIN?
THANK YOU FOR THE NIGHTMARE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK THEY GOT TO CREATE
THE LITIGATION WAGON.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE THAT BETTER.
I MEAN, YOU SUE SOMEBODY.
YOU JUST OPEN THE DOOR --
"I'M SUING YOU."
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF WE HAD ONE THING
TO DO OVER AGAIN,
BASED ON BARBARA'S COMMENT
ALONE,
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE TO JUMP
INTO A TIME MACHINE...
[ CHUCKLES ] YES.
...GO BACK IN TIME,
AND NOT SELL THE LAS VEGAS
WEDDING WAGON.
EXACTLY.
