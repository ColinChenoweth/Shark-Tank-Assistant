HI, SHARKS. I'M ANNA STORK.
AND I'M ANDREA SHRESHTA.
AND OUR COMPANY
IS LuminAID.
WE'RE SEEKING $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF OUR BUSINESS.
LuminAID BRINGS LIGHT
TO THE WORLD.
OUR FIRST PRODUCT
IS AN INNOVATIVE SOLAR LIGHT
THAT IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL
FLASHLIGHT OR LANTERN.
IT STARTS OUT LIKE THIS --
A SLEEK, LITTLE PACKAGE,
AND IT INFLATES
TO DIFFUSE THE LIGHT
AND CREATE A LIGHTWEIGHT,
WATERPROOF LANTERN.
LuminAID'S L.E.D. LIGHTS PROVIDE
UP TO 16 HOURS OF ILLUMINATION,
AND IT HAS
TWO BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS.
YOU DON'T NEED ANY AA's, C's,
OR D's -- JUST SUNLIGHT.
USING THE BUILT-IN
SOLAR PANEL,
YOU CHARGE IT IN THE SUN
DURING THE DAYTIME,
AND THIS ENERGY IS STORED
IN A THIN, EFFICIENT,
RECHARGEABLE BATTERY.
LuminAID IS PERFECT
FOR OUTDOOR ADVENTURES.
TAKE IT CAMPING, HIKING,
AND EVEN BOATING
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY
WATERPROOF, AND IT FLOATS.
THIS PRODUCT IS USEFUL
IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS,
AND WE'VE PROVEN
THAT THERE'S GLOBAL DEMAND.
BUT WHAT WE'RE
REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT
IS THE "AID"
IN "LuminAID."
OUR LIGHT
SHINED BRIGHTEST
FOR THOSE
WHO ARE LEFT DEVASTATED
AFTER A NATURAL DISASTER.
WE HAVE THE PERFECT TOOL
FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO USE
ON THE GROUND
IN AREAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY
OR THAT ARE RAVAGED
BY FLOODS.
AND BEFORE DISASTER
EVEN STRIKES,
LuminAID IS PERFECT IN THE HOME
AND CAR, JUST IN CASE.
WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING
LuminAID A WORLDWIDE BRAND
AND HOPEFULLY
MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES
A LITTLE BRIGHTER, TOO.
WE ALWAYS SAY,
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LUMENS...
Both: ...GET LuminAID.
WHO WANTS TO JOIN US?
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT WAS GREAT.
Cuban: OH, LORD.
EXPLAIN THE TECHNOLOGY.
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.
IT'S A SOLAR PANEL,
A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
REALLY SIMILAR
TO THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
THAT'S
IN YOUR CELLPHONE.
THANK YOU.
JUST A BRIGHT L.E.D. LIGHT.
SO, IT INFLATES TO DIFFUSE
THE LIGHT LIKE A LANTERN,
HAVING
A LAMPSHADE EFFECT.
DID YOU CREATE THIS?
YEAH. SO, WE'RE
ACTUALLY STUDENTS.
WE WERE AT COLUMBIA
GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE
RIGHT AFTER
THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE IN 2010,
PEOPLE WERE COMPLETELY
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY,
AND THERE WASN'T
A LIGHTING PRODUCT
THAT WAS BEING DISTRIBUTED
IN VOLUME.
SO WE SPENT THE SEMESTER
PROTOTYPING THE PRODUCT BY HAND.
Shreshta: WE MADE THE FIRST
50 OF THESE IN OUR KITCHENS.
AND AS IT HAPPENS,
A YEAR LATER,
WE OURSELVES WERE IN JAPAN
DURING THE 2011 EARTHQUAKE.
AND EVEN FOR US,
OUR PROTOTYPES --
I MEAN, WE USED THEM
DURING THE POWER OUTAGES THEN.
AND WE REALIZED, LIKE,
THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT HAS --
YOU KNOW,
FILLS A UNIVERSAL NEED.
HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?
IT LASTS 16 HOURS
ON THE LOW SETTING
AND 10 HOURS
ON THE HIGH SETTING,
AND THEN YOU JUST RECHARGE IT
IN THE SUN IN SEVEN HOURS.
[ BLOWS ]
DO YOU HAVE
AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND?
I DO. SO,
I STUDIED ENGINEERING
AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE
IN MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE,
AND THEN WE BOTH WENT ON
TO COLUMBIA GRADUATE SCHOOL.
TELL --
TELL US ABOUT SALES, THEN.
IN THE FIRST YEAR,
WE DID $250,000 IN SALES.
WHOA!
IN THIS LAST 12 MONTHS,
WE DID JUST OVER $1 MILLION.
Greiner: WOW.
Herjavec: IMPRESSIVE.
WHOA!
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO, WE ACTUALLY HAVE --
I MEAN, THERE ARE
THREE SORT OF CUSTOMER TYPES
THAT WE SELL TO -- IT'D BE
INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY ONLINE,
AND THEN WE HAVE, YOU KNOW,
WHOLESALE/RETAIL/COMMERCIAL,
AND THAT INCLUDES
OUR INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION,
AND THEN THE LAST WOULD BE
NGOs AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
TELL ME THE MARGIN.
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THE NGOs?
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THEM?
WHAT PROCESS ARE YOU USING?
SO, WE HAVE A COUPLE
LARGER NGO CUSTOMERS.
OUR LARGEST IS
IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
THAT PROCURE SUPPLIES
AND DISTRIBUTES THEM
IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.
LIKE A RED CROSS OR...
EXACTLY.
SO, IT'S ACTUALLY ShelterBox.
YOU CAN SHIP 50 OF THESE
FOR THE SPACE OF 8 FLASHLIGHTS.
SO, THEY HAVE PURCHASED 30,000
UNITS IN THE PAST 10 MONTHS.
THEY'RE ONE OF
OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS.
AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU SELL IT TO THEM FOR.
WE SELL TO THEM FOR $8.75.
AND HOW DO YOU SELL --
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR
IN THE OTHER TWO AREAS?
OUR DIRECT-CUSTOMER PRICE
IS $19.95.
AND WHAT'S YOUR COST?
COST TO MANUFACTURE IT
IS $4.75.
AND DO YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF FUNDING BEHIND YOU?
WE EACH PUT IN $7,500
OF OUR OWN MONEY
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
WE HAD A GOOD IDEA.
SO, THEN
WE LAUNCHED THE PRODUCT
THROUGH A SUCCESSFUL
CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN.
WE RAISED $50,000
ON A GOAL OF $10,000.
WE'VE LEVERAGED
BUSINESS-PLAN COMPETITIONS
AND GRANT COMPETITIONS, AND
WE WON AN ADDITIONAL $195,000.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND WE'VE PUT $145,000 OF THAT
BACK INTO THE BUSINESS.
BRAVO.
IT'S BRILLIANTLY DESIGNED.
[ Chuckling ]
I'M SUPER IMPRESSED BY YOU.
DID YOU PATENT THIS?
WE HAVE
TWO UTILITY PATENTS FILED.
OUR PATENTS WERE FILED
THROUGH COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY,
WHERE WE WERE STUDENTS
AT THE TIME, SO...
MM.
OH. DO THEY OWN
A PIECE OF YOUR COMPANY?
THEY OWN 2%.
SO, I MEAN, WE WERE STUDENTS,
AND WE HAD NO MONEY...
NO MONEY.
[ Chuckling ] ...TO --
TO FRONT THE PATENT.
IT ALL WENT INTO THIS.
SO, YOU -- YOU PAY THE -- HOW DO
YOU PAY THEM FOR THEIR 2%?
SO, OKAY, SO,
THEY ALSO HAVE 2% ROYALTIES
FOR ANY
COMMERCIAL RETAIL SALES.
ROYALTIES, YOU SAY?
John: AH.
YES. RIGHT UP
YOUR ALLEY, SO...
HOWEVER -- HOWEVER,
ALL OF OUR NGO, MILITARY,
AND HUMANITARIAN-AID SALES
ARE EXEMPT FROM THAT.
I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE
A ROYALTY DEAL IN PLACE
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
TACK ONTO THAT.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU $200,000
AND ATTACH
TO THE COLUMBIA ROYALTY.
WHENEVER THEY GET PAID,
I ALSO GET A ROYALTY OF 4%,
ALL RIGHT?
MY ROYALTY GOES AWAY
AFTER I'VE RECEIVED BACK
FOUR TIMES ON MY MONEY,
ALL RIGHT?
I GET NO EQUITY.
ONCE I RECOVER $800,000,
POOF -- I DISAPPEAR.
POOF.
DO THAT AGAIN.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU -- YOU EXPERIENCE THE
WONDERFULNESS OF MR. WONDERFUL,
BUT THEN HE'S GONE
LIKE THE DREAM HE WAS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, THAT'S A --
DEFINITELY AN INTERESTING OFFER.
OF COURSE IT IS.
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NICE TO THINK ABOUT
YOU GOING AWAY AFTER A TIME,
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE...
[ LAUGHTER ]
I FEEL LIKE THAT
EVERY DAY.
NO.
<i>EVERY</i> DAY.
WE ALSO WANT
A STRATEGIC PARTNER.
SO, YOU WANT TO SELL EQUITY.
YOU WANT TO SELL EQUITY.
YEAH, WE THINK
THE TIME IS RIGHT.
WE WANT A PARTNER.
Herjavec: FOR SURE.
YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO BUILD
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND IT.
SO, LADIES, HERE'S MY CONCEPT.
HAT'S OFF. YOU'RE BRILLIANT.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU $300,000
FOR 20%.
MY MAIN GOAL IS TO LICENSE IT.
I WANT YOU TO BE INVENTORS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR OFFER.
I MEAN, I THINK THAT IS
A LITTLE BIT MORE EQUITY
THAN WE WERE HOPING FOR,
BUT IT'S A --
BUT YOU WON'T
HAVE TO RAISE AGAIN.
AH...EQUITY --
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE.
[ Chuckling ]
IT IS EXPENSIVE.
WE KNOW.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE...
YES, SELL YOUR SOUL
AND YOUR FUTURE.
YOU KNOW, THIS PRODUCT
CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.
I LOVE PRODUCTS
THAT ACTUALLY HELP
MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE
AND HELP PEOPLE
THAT ARE IN HARD SITUATIONS.
SO, MY OFFER IS $200,000
FOR 20%.
I JUST
BELIEVE IN YOU GUYS.
I THINK THAT YOU'RE AMAZING
AND BRILLIANT
[ CHUCKLES ] BUT SHE'S TAKING
MORE EQUITY.
I KNOW I AM ASKING --
I'M MAKING A STIFFER DEAL HERE,
BUT I THINK
THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE
A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF MY TIME
IN WORKING WITH YOU
AND HELPING YOU FOR --
YOU DID IMPRESS ME, LORI,
BY ACTUALLY BEING GREEDIER
THAN KEVIN ON THAT ONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, THAT'S MY OFFER.
I LIKE MY DEAL A LOT,
BY THE WAY.
I LIKE YOU.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
I THINK IT'S LOOKING BETTER
AND BETTER BY THE MINUTE.
WELL, WE'RE TAKING ALL THINGS
INTO CONSIDERATION.
LORI, THANK YOU.
THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW,
THAT IS A LITTLE STEEP
IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION
OF THE COMPANY THAT WE WERE --
ATTAGIRL. I LOVE YOU.
OH, MY GOD. I LOVE THESE GIRLS.
[ STORK LAUGHS ]
I LOVE THESE GIRLS.
SO, IF THERE'S ANY WAY
YOU COULD COME DOWN
IN YOUR EQUITY TO MAYBE --
IT'S THE GREED PROBLEM,
ISN'T IT?
THAT'S WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK
TO TEAM WONDERFUL.
[ LAUGHS ]
THIS KIND OF SAVAGERY --
30%, 20%.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE MONEY...
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
...SO, RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
TAKING MORE CASH OUT
OF EVERY UNIT JUST DOESN'T --
YOU MAY NOT NEED MORE MONEY
IF YOU LICENSE.
YOU MAY NOT NEED MORE MONEY
IF YOU LICENSE.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LOT OF CAPITAL.
MY DEAL --
THEY DON'T NEED MORE CAPITAL.
THEY CAN BE DESIGNERS,
AND THEY CAN BE CREATORS.
THEY DO.
WITH YOUR DEAL,
THEY HAVE TO START SHIPPING.
THEY HAVE TO HANDLE TO HANDLE
BEING A SALESPERSON...
DO YOU WANT TO DO DAYMOND'S DEAL
OR NOT? YES OR NO?
Narrator: ANDREA AND ANNA

LuminAID.
LORI'S OFFER IS $200,000
FOR 20%.

AND THEY CAN BE CREATORS.
O'Leary: THEY DO.
WITH YOUR DEAL,
THEY HAVE TO START SHIPPING.
THEY HAVE TO HANDLE TO HANDLE
BEING A SALESPERSON...
DO YOU WANT TO DO DAYMOND'S DEAL
OR NOT? YES OR NO?
Cuban: WAIT. HOLD --
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
HOW BIG CAN YOU MAKE
THE INFLATABLES?
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN
MAKE THEM BIG,
THAT CREATES A WHOLE NEW
CATEGORY THAT CHANGES THE GAME.
Shreshta: YEAH, I MEAN,
THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND OUR --
YOU KNOW, THE COMBINATION
OF THE SOLAR L.E.D.
AND THE INFLATABLE,
SO YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOURSELF UP
TO EVEN, LIKE, NEW SHAPES,
APPLICATIONS,
AND INTEGRATIONS,
LIKE LIFE VESTS
OR RAFT-TYPE INTEGRATION.
I MEAN, I LIKE IT.
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO.
YEAH.
AND I'M SURE
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS
JUST TO BUILD THIS,
RIGHT?
NO, WE'RE NOT.
SO I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
AND I'M GONNA SHOW KEVIN
WHAT CREATIVITY'S ALL ABOUT.
HE TRIES.
SO, I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
200K FOR 15%,
AND I WANT THE OPTION
TO LEAD THROUGH YOUR NEXT ROUND
OF FINANCING
IN THE AMOUNT OF $300,000.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU GOT
A FOUNDATION TO GROW FROM,
'CAUSE, AGAIN,
WHERE YOU'RE GOING
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN WHERE YOU ARE.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S EXACTLY THE AMOUNT
I WAS GONNA OFFER.
MY OFFER IS $200,000
FOR THE 15%.
YES, YOU WILL NEED
MORE MONEY.
I-I DO SEE
A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PATH.
I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE 100%
CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THE FUTURE.
EXACTLY, AND I LOVE THAT.
I SEE A RETAIL MARKET.
I DO SEE THE NGO MARKET
CONTINUING TO GROW.
UM...AND THEN YOU CREATE
THE NEXT ROUND.
LADIES, YOU HAVE FIVE OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
THAT'S RATHER RARE
IN THE SHARK TANK.
NOW YOU HAVE TO
MAKE A DECISION.
THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU.
YES.
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF WE STEPPED OUT?
I WOULD NOT LEAVE THE TANK
AT THIS JUNCTURE.
OKAY, THANK YOU
FOR THE ADVICE.
BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
WE WON'T, BUT OKAY.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, ONE THING
WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
COMING IN HERE AS MUCH
WAS THE FUTURE AND, YOU KNOW,
SOMEBODY REALLY BEING THERE
TO HELP US FUND THAT.
WE APPRECIATE
EVERYONE'S OFFERS.
MARK, I THINK
YOU GOT A DEAL.
THANK YOU. I'M EXCITED
TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS.
WHAT WAS IT?
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME.
I'M SO CONFUSED.
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
Stork:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Cuban:
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
I'M EXCITED.
THANK YOU ALL
FOR YOUR TIME.
Greiner:
REALLY SMART, LADIES.
GREAT GIRLS.
GREAT LADIES.
AHH!
HIGH FIVE. [ LAUGHS ]
SMART GIRLS. I'M GONNA --
I'M GONNA GO APPLY FOR A JOB.
WE WON'T HIRE YOU.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FUTURE.
SOMETHING COULD SURPASS THIS
IN TWO SECONDS.
RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S THE RISK
OF INVESTING.
YEP, THAT IS.
I THINK WE MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.
I MEAN, WE REALLY COULDN'T
GO WRONG.
THEY'RE ALL
GREAT PARTNERS.
EXACTLY.
BUT MARK
REALLY SAW THE VISION
FOR THE COMPANY
AND THE TECHNOLOGY,
AND THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT
TO US, BECAUSE WE DO, TOO.
Narrator: EARLIER THIS SEASON,
NAVY S.E.A.L. ELI CRANE
AND HIS WIFE, JEN,
MADE A DEAL WITH KEVIN AND MARK
FOR THEIR UNIQUE BOTTLE-OPENER
COMPANY, BOTTLE BREACHER.
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!
LET'S DO IT!!
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY CRAZY
SINCE "SHARK TANK" AIRED.
OUR WEBSITE CRASHED.
IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS.
WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK,
WE PROBABLY HAD
60,000 BOTTLE BREACHERS SOLD.
NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT,
"OKAY, HOW DO WE
MAKE ALL OF THESE?"
WHERE ARE WE AT
FOR THE DAY?
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE AT 975,
SO WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD.
AWESOME.
WE WENT FROM
MAKING 175 A DAY
TO HAVING TO MAKE
OVER 1,000 A DAY.
WE HAD TO MOVE INTO
THIS NEW FACILITY.
WE WENT FROM
8 EMPLOYEES TO 32,
AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO HIRE
A LOT OF VETERANS,
SO WE'RE PRETTY PROUD
OF THAT.
Jen:
WHEN WE PITCHED, WE WERE AT
A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES.
NOW, IN THREE MONTHS,
WE'RE AT $2.5 MILLION.
ELI, JEN.
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?
O'Leary: I WANTED TO COME HERE
AND THANK JEN AND ELI
FOR THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS
THEY'VE HAD
SINCE THEY AIRED
ON "SHARK TANK."
YOU ARE AT $2.5 MILLION --
THAT'S GREAT NEWS,
BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT
THE BACKORDERS.
BOTTLE BREACHER
IS A CLASSIC SUCCESS STORY,
WITH THE PROBLEM
SUCCESS BRINGS.
WHENEVER THERE'S A HUGE SURGE
IN THE INTEREST IN A PRODUCT
AND YOU GET
A WHOLE BUNCH OF ORDERS,
YOU'VE GOT TO FULFILL THEM.
OTHERWISE, YOU END UP
WITH A LOT OF UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS.
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE
THIS GETS FIXED.
ALL RIGHT, NOW I KNOW
WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS.
Jen:
YOU'RE GONNA GROW AND BE TALL?
YEAH.
NO, YOU'RE GONNA STAY
MY BABY.
[ ELI LAUGHS ]
I JUST GOT OUT OF THE NAVY
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.
JEN AND I WERE
REALLY CONCERNED WITH,
"HOW ARE WE
GONNA PAY OUR BILLS?
BECAUSE OF
THE "SHARK TANK,"
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE
TO PROVIDE FOR OURSELVES
AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE AREA.
EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T WEAR A UNIFORM ANYMORE,
I STILL FEEL LIKE
I GET TO SERVE THIS COUNTRY,
AND "SHARK TANK" HAS GIVEN US
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.
All: BREACHER UP!
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A YOUNG COUPLE
WITH A MISSION TO HELP
A GLOBAL COMMUNITY.
