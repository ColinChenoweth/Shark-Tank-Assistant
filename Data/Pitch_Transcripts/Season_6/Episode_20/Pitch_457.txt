MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER GRAY,
I'M FROM PHILADELPHIA,
PENNSYLVANIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS SCHOLLY.
I'M SEEKING $40,000
FOR 15% OF MY COMPANY.
COLLEGE IS EXPENSIVE.
I KNOW -- I'M A STUDENT.
THE COST OF COLLEGE
RISES EVERY YEAR,
AND STUDENTS AND PARENTS
ARE FORCED
TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS
TO PAY THE BILLS.
THIS PUTS MANY STUDENTS
IN INSURMOUNTABLE DEBT.
BUT THERE'S AN ALTERATIVE --
SCHOLARSHIPS.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
THESE SCHOLARSHIPS
ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND.
THIS CAUSES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN FREE MONEY TO GO TO WASTE,
AS MANY STUDENTS DON'T KNOW
THIS MONEY EXISTS.
SO, THAT'S WHY
I CREATED SCHOLLY.
SCHOLLY'S A MOBILE APP
THAT MATCHES STUDENTS
WITH HUNDREDS
OF POTENTIAL SCHOLARSHIPS.
YOU SIMPLY INPUT SOME
INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF,
SUCH AS THE STATE YOU LIVE IN,
YOUR GPA, AND PRESS "MATCH"...
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT --
A LIST OF SCHOLARSHIPS
YOU QUALIFY FOR,
LITERALLY IN MINUTES.
SO, WE HAVE, LIKE,
THE LORI SCHOLARSHIP,
BANK OF THE TANK,
SHARK BAIT SCHOLARSHIP,
MR. WONDERFUL'S
STINGY SCHOLARSHIP.
SEE? $1,000.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Cuban:
I LIKE HIM ALREADY.
WE LOVE YOU ALREADY.
BOY, YOU'RE REALLY
SUCKING UP TO ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE STINGY, MAN.
I CAN'T -- WHAT CAN I SAY?
SCHOLLY ISN'T JUST A BUSINESS,
IT'S MY PASSION.
I WANT TO HELP STUDENTS
LIKE MYSELF
FIND MONEY TO GO TO
THE COLLEGE OF THEIR DREAMS.
SO, INVESTING IN SCHOLLY
MEANS THAT YOU, TOO,
CAN MAKE SOME DREAMS
COME TRUE.
SO LET'S DO THIS.
CHRISTOPHER, GREAT IDEA.
YOU ARE 100% CORRECT.
THERE ARE <i>SO MANY</i> SCHOLARSHIPS,
IT'S A JUNGLE.
YES.
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE
FIGURE IT ALL OUT.
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS --
IS THAT THE ACTUAL APP
THAT YOU SHOWED ME?
THAT'S THE ACTUAL APP.
THE APP IS FOR iPhone
AND ANDROID, YES.
HOW ARE YOU CURATING
ALL THE SCHOLARSHIPS?
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN BUILDING
DATABASES AND HELPING STUDENTS
WITH SCHOLARSHIPS
FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW.
AND I AGGREGATED
THAT LIST OF SCHOLARSHIPS
FROM DIFFERENT WEBSITES,
THEN I MANUALLY INPUT THEM,
AND, BASICALLY,
ONCE THEY'RE IN OUR DATABASE,
WE DON'T -- WE DON'T HAVE TO
MANAGE THE PROCESS ANYMORE.
DO YOU DO THIS BY YOURSELF,
OR DO YOU HAVE PARTNERS?
I HAVE TWO CO-FOUNDERS.
THEY BOTH ARE APP
AND WEB DEVELOPERS.
I AM THE --
I'M THE BUSINESS GUY, THE C.E.O.
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
SO, I'M JUST RIGHT
NOW A JUNIOR.
I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE
AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY.
I WON $1.3 MILLION
IN SCHOLARSHIPS.
$1.3 MILLION?
Cuban: WHAT?!
YES.
O'Leary: REALLY?
I'M FASCINATED BY THAT.
HOW DID YOU ACHIEVE THAT?
YEAH, I MEAN,
THAT'S LIKE A LOTTERY WIN.
SO -- YES, SO --
HOW DID YOU GET THERE?
YEAH, SO, I --
IT TOOK ME A WHILE.
IT TOOK ME ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS
BEGINNING IN MY JUNIOR YEAR
TO REALLY FIND ALL
THESE DIFFERENT SCHOLARSHIPS.
I SCOURED THE WEB.
I GOT MULTIPLE
FULL-RIDE SCHOLARSHIPS.
I GOT COCA--
THE COCA-COLA SCHOLARSHIP.
WHAT WAS
THE BIGGEST ONE?
THE BILL GATES SCHOLARSHIP.
HOW MUCH?
WOW.
IT'S A FULL RIDE TO ANY COLLEGE
YOU WANT TO GO TO.
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DRIVE
TO GET THE SCHOLARSHIPS.
I HAD A SINGLE MOM --
LOW INCOME, TWO SIBLINGS.
AND I HAD TO WORK
REALLY HARD.
I HAD A GREAT GPA,
I HAD GREAT TEST SCORES,
AND I ACTUALLY COULD NOT APPLY
TO SOME OF THE SCHOOLS
I WANTED TO GO TO
BECAUSE OF THE APPLICATION FEES.
I THINK WE CAN ALL RELATE
TO THAT STORY.
RIGHT.
I'M THE FIRST PERSON
IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY
EVER TO GO TO COLLEGE.
I GET THE VALUE.
WHAT YOU JUST DID
WAS AMAZING.
SO, DO YOU THINK, LIKE,
YOU COULD GET ME $1.3 MILLION...
YES.
...FOR EDUCATING THESE --
THESE BOBOS UP HERE
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS?
YEAH, SO --
SO, ACTUALLY, WITH SCHOLLY,
EVERY STUDENT THAT USES OUR APP
IS MATCHED BETWEEN 120
TO 220 SCHOLARSHIPS,
TOTALING OVER $4 MILLION.
SO IT'S GIVING THEM ACCESS
TO WIN ALL THAT MONEY.
SO, IN OTHER WORDS, YOU --
YOU FOUND THE ONES THAT ARE --
ARE -- ARE
INSTITUTIONAL-NEUTRAL.
OUT--
THEY DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU GO.
YES, SCHOLLY FOCUSES
ON OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS.
WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT BOOKED
ON INSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS.
SO, TO DAYMOND...
Herjavec: AH.
...SO, DAYMOND,
YOUR QUESTION IS --
THERE ARE ABOUT $100 MILLION
THAT GOES UNCLAIMED
IN OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS,
MAINLY 'CAUSE STUDENTS
DON'T KNOW THEY EXIST.
OKAY, CHRISTOPHER,
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY WITH THIS?
SCHO-- SO, SCHOLLY IS 99 CENTS
IN THE APP STORE.
WE ALREADY SOLD 92,000 APPS.
HOW MANY?
92,000 PAID APPS,
LESS THAN A YEAR,
AND ALL
WITH ZERO MARKETING.
SO, IT'S REALLY COOL.
WE HAD A VERY EFFECTIVE
P.R. STRATEGY GOING FOR IT.
SO, I USED THE FACT THAT I WON
$1.3 MILLION IN SCHOLARSHIPS
AND PITCHED REPORTERS
TO THE FACT
THAT I CREATED THIS APP
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
IT'S BRILLIANT.
Greiner: DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW SOMETHING, CHRISTOPHER?
GO AHEAD.
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.
I HAVEN'T HEARD
A WHOLE LOT,
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER RIGHT NOW.
AWESOME.
Cuban: LET ME JUST ASK
SOME REAL QUESTIONS, OKAY?
MY OFFER RIGHT NOW IS
THE 40K FOR 15%.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
I BELIEVE IN WHAT
YOU'RE DOING -- IS GOOD.
I THINK THAT WE WILL
MAKE IT TOGETHER.
SO I HOPE
YOU JUST SAY YES.
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR
OTHER OFFERS, LORI.
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
THAT -- THAT REALLY MEANS
A LOT TO ME.
SCHOLLY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
I'M OFFERING YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
YES, I WOULD LOVE TO HE--
I DON'T --
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA ASK YOU,
"HOW DO WE MONETIZE THIS?"
BUT I WANT YOU
TO SAY YES.
John:
I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS.
IT'S REALLY
A PERSONAL MATTER.
I STARTED WORKING
AT 10 YEARS OLD.
AND I WAS RAISED
BY A SINGLE MOTHER.
ME, TOO.
WHEN I GOT TO
ABOUT THE AGE OF 17 YEARS OLD,
I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE,
BUT I HAD TO WORK
BECAUSE I SAW
HER WORKING THREE JOBS,
AND THERE WAS
NO FOOD ON THE TABLE.
I RESONATE WITH THIS, SO
I'LL OFFER YOU THE SAME THING --
THE $40,000 FOR 15%.
CHRISTOPHER, LOOK AT ME.
I BELIEVE IN
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I-I-I--
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW
WE'RE GOING TO MONETIZE IT.
I JUST WANT YOU
TO TAKE MY HAND
AND SAY "DEAL,"
AND WE WILL MAKE IT WORK.
BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IT
RIGHT NOW.
WOW, THAT'S
PRETTY AGGRESSIVE.
John:
IF SHE HAD THE BEST INTERESTS,
I THINK SHE WOULD LET YOU
LISTEN TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN IT.
NEVER HAPPENED,
CHRISTOPHER.
I -- WHATEVER WAY,
I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS.
LOOK AT ME.
I-I JUST WANT TO HEAR
WHAT EVERYONE HAS TO SAY.
Herjavec: CHRISTOPHER.
LIKE, I-I LOVE YOUR OFFER.
I LOVE THE MONEY.
DON'T GET IMPATIENT WITH ME,
AND, ALSO --
SO, CHRISTOPHER.
YEAH?
SO, THE KEY TO YOUR SITE
IS YOUR ABILITY
TO UPDATE THE SCHOLARSHIPS.
IS THERE A BACK-END ENGINE
THAT'S TAKING IT ALL IN?
HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?
HOW MANY DIFFERENT SCHOLARSHIPS
DID YOU SAY
WERE IN YOUR DATABASE?
BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000.
OH!
MY CO-FOUNDER
DEVELOPED AN ALGORITHM
WHERE HE GATHERED ALL THE
SCHOLARSHIPS FROM DIFFERENT --
FROM DIFFERENT --
FROM DIFFERENT WEBSITES.
NOW, SEE, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO GET TO.
YEAH.
LOOK, YOU HAVE
TWO CO-FOUNDERS.
RIGHT.
THEY'RE DEVELOPERS.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THEIR SKILL SET IS BECAUSE --
ME -- ME TOO, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA
CONSTANTLY DO IT.
YOU WALKED IN HERE
WITH A THOUGHT.
THIS COULD BE
A VERY LARGE BUSINESS.
AND DAYMOND AND I BOTH
ARE NOT EVEN ASKING YOU.
[ SIGHS ]
WELL, LET HIM ANSWER IT.
LET HIM ANSWER.
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HE SAYS TO THAT.
John: YEAH.
Greiner:
WE'RE SAYING -- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
EXACTLY THE WRONG THING.
HANG ON. HANG ON.
THAT'S -- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE DOESN'T WANT.
Herjavec:
LORI, YOU'RE MINIMIZING HIM.
JUST HANG ON.
I'M NOT MINIMIZING HIM.
DO YOU WANT
A CHARITY DONATION...
HE ARE READY -- NO.
...OR DO YOU WANT TO BUILD
A BUSINESS? WHICH IS IT?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I MEAN, I -- MY GOAL HERE --
I WANT SOMEONE THAT REALLY
BELIEVES IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.
THIS DOESN'T MEAN -- YEAH.
I TOLD YOU I DID.
John: I BELIEVE IN IT.
ROBERT AND MARK PROBABLY HAVE --
HOW COULD YOU BELIEVE IN IT
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED
ABOUT THE ENTIRE BUSINESS
AND HOW IT WORKS?
HERE -- BECAUSE THIS --
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
BECAUSE -- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'LL TAKE AFFORDABLE
NEXT STEPS FORWARD.
YOU KNOW, CHRISTOPHER,
YOU KNOW --
WE WILL CALL THE OTHER ROBERTS
AND CUBANS OF THE WORLD
TO GIVE US ADVICE ON THIS.
WELL, YOU --
YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU
KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M WILLING
TO DO IT WITH DAYMOND.
YEAH, OKAY.
DAYMOND, IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO DO IT WITH ME...
I ABSOLUTELY WILL DO IT
WITH YOU.
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD JUST SAY
RIGHT NOW, "DO IT."
OKAY, LORI AND I ARE GONNA GO
IN 50-50 PARTNERS.
THAT'S $20,000 FROM HER,
$20,000 FROM ME
FOR 15% OF YOUR COMPANY.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION NOW.
I'M GONNA TAKE --
I'M GONNA TAKE YOUR DEAL.
DONE.
GOOD. DONE.
THANKS.
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS. THANKS.
THANK, MAN.
THAT'S AWESOME.
THANK YOU.
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
I'M REALLY GLAD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
LET'S GET A GROUP HUG.
GROUP HUG.
GROUP -- GROUP HUG!
THANKS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
THANKS.
THANKS SO MUCH.
I AM FEELING REALLY GREAT.
I STEPPED IN THE SHARK TANK
THINKING, LIKE,
"PROFIT, PROFIT, PROFIT,"
BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY TO FIND
TWO SHARKS WHO DON'T --
WHO CARE MORE
ABOUT WHAT SCHOLLY'S GONNA DO
FOR THE PUBLIC THAN --
THAN THE BOTTOM LINE,
SO I'M REALLY HAPPY.
I'M SUPER EXCITED.
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I HAD NOTHING
AND, UH, COULDN'T RUB
TWO PENNIES TOGETHER,
YOU KNOW
WHAT I REALLY HATED?
I HATED WHEN PEOPLE WANTED
TO GIVE ME A BREAK
BECAUSE
THEY FELT BAD FOR ME.
UH, WE'RE NOT DOING IT
BECAUSE WE FEEL BAD FOR HIM.
John: I DIDN'T FEEL BAD.
I DON'T FEEL BAD AT ALL.
Cuban: I NEVER GOT
ONE OF THOSE. [ LAUGHS ]
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I DON'T FEEL BAD AT ALL.
I'M NOT UNDERMINING
WHAT YOU DID.
YEAH, BUT WHY DO YOU THINK
THIS WAS A PITY MOVE?
THE GUY WAS A GREAT GUY.
IT WASN'T A PITY MOVE.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
THE BACK-END ENGINE WORKED.
YOU DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO, BUT -- BUT HERE'S WHAT --
HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW --
HE WAS 99 CENTS AN APP.
BUT I ASKED, "IS IT A CHARITY,
OR IS IT A BUSINESS?"
HE WAS 99 CENTS AN APP.
HE DOWNLOADED 92,000.
Greiner: SOMETIMES,
IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT MONEY.
I'M -- I'M A VERY
CHARITABLE GUY, TOO.
SOMETIMES,
IT'S ABOUT HELPING AMERICA
AND MAKING THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE.
IS IT A CHARITY?
LORI, THAT IS SUCH CRAP.
NO, IT IS NOT CRAP.
I TELLING YOU --
I'M NOT SITTING HERE --
WE ARE NOT
THE CHARITY TANK.
NO, WE ARE NOT
THE CHARITY TANK.
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO GIVE IT OUT.
THAT'S NOT CHARITY,
ROBERT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S NOT CHARITY, AND --
REALLY?
HOW DOES THAT WORK?
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GROW
THAT BUSINESS?
WHAT'S THE EXECUTION PLAN?
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO?
WE'RE GONNA BUILD THE
BUSINESS -- TRUST ME ON THIS.
WE'RE GONNA GROW --
PEOPLE GETTING EDUCATIONS.
WHAT? "WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT?"
YES, WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AMERICA, COME TO THE TANK!
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU MONEY
BECAUSE WE LIKE YOU.
OH, MY GOD.
OH, YOU DIDN'T INVEST IN ANYBODY
ELSE WHO'S GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU BET ON THE PERSON.
I NEVER GOT ANY INFORMATION.
WITH THE --
WITH THE INFORMATION --
I GOT INFORMATION.
HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO TALK
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO FORCE $40,000
DOWN HIS THROAT
LIKE A GOOSE FOR P‚TÈ.
[ Laughing ] OH, MY GOD.
YEAH.
NO PROBLEM, GUYS.
THAT'S WHAT HE CAME IN ASKING!
I THOUGHT, AT THAT POINT, THAT
I RECEIVED ENOUGH INFORMATION
TO FEEL LIKE I WANT TO BE PART
OF THE RIDE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAYMOND?
IF HE WOULD HAVE JUST SAID,
"THIS IS AN IDEA,"
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
LOOK, I-I'M NOT TRYING
TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME.
I AGREE.
I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE YOU A
HARD TIME. YOU KNOW I REALLY --
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T LIKE
WHEN YOU GET SCOOPED.
[ Laughing ] OH!
OH!
THE BOTTOM LINE IS
THAT THIS GUY -- THIS GUY --
IT -- THAT WAS SO --
WAIT. EXCUSE ME.
I'M TALKING.
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT DAYMOND AND I,
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
THAT THIS GUY NEEDS --
WE'LL BE THERE TO BACK HIM.
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU JUST
BENT OVER BACKWARDS FOR $40,000.
IT IS NOT
THE CHARITY TANK.
COME ON. COME ON, LORI.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IF YOU'RE TRULY TRYING
TO HELP THE GUY THEN --
I AM.
WAIT. IF YOU'RE TRULY TRYING
TO HELP THE GUY,
WHAT I WANT TO DO
IS ASK HIM QUESTIONS.
THIS IS ALL SOUR GRAPES.
HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT
AN ALGORITHM.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALGORITHMS?
IT'S ALL SOUR GRAPES.
IT'S NOT SOUR GRAPES!
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
REALLY PISSING ME OFF RIGHT NOW.
I'M GONNA SAY
SOMETHING RUDE TO YOU.
[ LAUGHS ] NO, DON'T,
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A RUDE GUY.
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING RUDE TO YOU,
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO,
OKAY?
BECAUSE I -- THERE WAS NO NEED
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YES, YOU SHOULD DO THAT,
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT YOU.
YOU GOT --
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THAT.
YOU'RE NOT THE GUY
TO WALK AWAY AND WALK OFF.
YES, WE'RE THE SHARK TANK,
WE'RE NOT THE CHARITY TANK.
BUT SOMETIMES, THERE'S
A POINT TO BEING COMPASSIONATE
AND CARING ABOUT THINGS
THAT MATTER.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S NOT AN INFLUENCE.
THEN GIVE HIM $100,000.
RUN OUT THERE
AND CHANGE IT TO $100,000.
THINGS THAT MATTER.
THINGS THAT MATTER.
BE COMPASSIONATE.
EDUCATION AND SCHOLARSHIP
IS IMPORTANT.
BE COMPASSIONATE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
THE GUY --
HE ALREADY DIED 'CAUSE YOU'VE
CHOKED HIM ON THE $40,000.
OH, MY GOD.
YOU WANT
TO HELP ALL THESE KIDS
AND SEND A MESSAGE,
BE COMPASSIONATE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT WHAT I DID.
LET'S GO.
DAYMOND, DO YOU?
I FEEL GREAT.
WE FEEL GREAT.
I THINK THEY DON'T LIKE
THAT WE JUMPED IN.
I'M SORRY
THAT THEY WERE UPSET.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S SOUR GRAPES.
WHAT WE DID WAS GREAT.
THANK YOU.
I LOVE IT.
