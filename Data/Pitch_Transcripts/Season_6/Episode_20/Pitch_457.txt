MY NAME IS RYAN FANT.
AND I'M NAYEEM HUSSAIN.
WE'RE FROM NEW YORK CITY.
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF KEEN HOME.
TAXI!
RYAN AND I MET STUDYING AT
THE NYU STERN SCHOOL
OF BUSINESS DOING OUR MBAs.
WE BECAME
VERY GOOD FRIENDS.
LOOK AT THIS.
KEEP GOING.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
OH!
NYU HAS AN AMAZING
ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM.
WE ENTERED
A BUSINESS COMPETITION CALLED
THE ENTREPRENEURS CHALLENGE.
THEY AWARDED US
AN $18,000 GRANT.
AND THIS YEAR,
WE EARNED A SPOT
IN <i>INC.</i> MAGAZINE'S
"COOLEST COLLEGE STARTUPS."
SO, HEAR, HEAR!
IT REALLY GAVE US
THE CONFIDENCE
THAT THE BUSINESS THAT WE WERE
CREATING REALLY HAD LEGS.
WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT
SOME BOXES.
I LIKE
THE SLEEVE CONCEPT HERE.
WE'VE SINCE GRADUATED
FROM NYU.
NOW RYAN AND I ARE FULL TIME
AT KEEN HOME,
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING
OUR FIRST PRODUCT TO MARKET.
THERE WE GO.
WE NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
TO HELP US SCALE
TO MEET DEMAND
AND GROW THE COMPANY
EVEN FASTER.
I THINK PART OF BEING
AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS REALLY JUST BELIEVING
THAT YOU'RE GONNA SUCCEED
NO MATTER WHAT.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE
THAT KEEN HOME IS SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA TAKE US
VERY FAR IN LIFE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS RYAN FANT.
AND I'M NAYEEM HUSSAIN.
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF KEEN HOME,
HEADQUARTERED
IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.
WE'RE SEEKING $750,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
Hussain: THE KEEN VENT IS
A WIRELESSLY CONNECTED AIR VENT
THAT AUTOMATICALLY OPENS
AND CLOSES
TO INTELLIGENTLY REDIRECT
AIRFLOW THROUGHOUT A HOME.
THE KEEN VENT
IS EASILY USER-INSTALLED.
A CUSTOMER SIMPLY REMOVES
THE EXISTING VENT
FROM THE DUCT OPENING
AND INSERTS OUR PRODUCT
IN ITS PLACE.
ONCE INSTALLED,
THE VENT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTS
TO THE INTERNET.
THE AVERAGE U.S. HOUSEHOLD
SPENDS HALF IT'S ENERGY BILL
ON HEATING AND COOLING.
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T USE
A SINGLE LIGHT SWITCH
TO CONTROL ALL THE LIGHTS
IN YOUR HOME,
SO WHY ARE WE STILL RELIANT
ON A CENTRAL THERMOSTAT
FOR THE HEATING-AND-COOLING
NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL ROOMS?
WITH THE KEEN VENT,
YOU CAN USE YOUR SMARTPHONE
TO TAKE CONTROL
OF YOUR AIRFLOW.
SO, SHARKS, ARE YOU READY
TO HELP US MAKE EVERY HOME...
Both: ...A KEEN HOME?
SO, IT'S A THERMOSTAT,
IN ESSENCE?
NOT REALLY --
IT'S AN AIRFLOW --
SO, IS IT
JUST A AIRFLOW --
THINK ABOUT IT AS A COMPLEMENT
TO AN EXISTING THERMOSTAT.
SO, IF YOU HAVE
A SMART THERMOSTAT, LIKE A NEST,
IT'LL MAKE
YOUR NEST SMARTER.
HOW MUCH MONEY DO I SAVE
IN A MONTH?
IF MY TYPICAL BILL
IS 600 BUCKS...
SURE. YEP.
...HOW MUCH MONEY
DO I SAVE?
THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER
SPENDS $2,000 PER YEAR
ON HEATING AND COOLING.
IF WE CAN REDUCE THE COST
BY EVEN JUST 10%,
WHICH WOULD BE WAY LESS
THAN WHAT OUR TESTS HAVE SHOWN.
YOU HAVE A TWO-YEAR R.O.I.
IT'S A TWO-YEAR R.O.I.
HOW MANY UNITS DID THEY PUT
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE HOUSES?
FOUR TO UP TO SIX.
FOUR.
WE HAD A --
OUR PRODUCT
COSTS $80 PER VENT.
OKAY, SO, NOT -- NOT --
OKAY, SO --
SO, A SYSTEM OF FOUR
IS $320.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU ALL INVESTED,
AND HOW MUCH HAVE YOU
GONE OUTSIDE TO GET?
THIS IS ABOUT -- THIS IS
ABOUT TO GET TO INVESTORS
AND ALL KIND OF STUFF
RIGHT NOW.
YEAH, SO,
WE INVESTED $50,000 --
WE INVESTED $50,000
OF OUR PERSONAL MONEY,
AND THEN WE RAISED, RIGHT
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,
$120,000 AS A PART OF THE
TECHSTARS ACCELERATOR PROGRAM.
UH-HUH.
AND THEN, IN MAY, WE CLOSED
A SEED ROUND OF $1.5 MILLION.
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
[ LAUGHS ]
SILLY GOOSE.
OH, THE PUNCH LINE,
RIGHT?
YOU DIDN'T THINK
WE WERE GONNA GET TO THAT, HUH?
WHAT WAS THE PRE-MONEY --
WHAT WAS THE PRE-MONEY VALUE
ON THE $1.5 MILLION?
$3.75 MILLION.
MM-HMM.
SO, THAT ROUND PUTS YOU AT A
POST-MONEY OF ABOUT $5 MILLION?
ABOUT --
ROUGHLY $5 MILLION, YEAH.
$5 MILLION, YEAH.
WHAT IS THE ADDED VALUE
THAT MAKES ME PAY
AN ADDITIONAL $2.5 MILLION,
'CAUSE YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO GIVE YOU $7.5 MILLION.
NO, MORE THAN THAT.
WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE MAY
THAT WOULD MAKE ME PAY
THAT MUCH MORE?
WE DE-RISKED THE BUSINESS
FROM BEING AN IDEA TO NOW IT'S
THE PRODUCT. WE HAVE --
NO, YOU HAVEN'T
SOLD ANY YET.
WE'VE PRESOLD 35,000 UNITS
TO LOWE'S.
Greiner: PRESOLD 35,000 UNITS
TO LOWE'S.
OH.
35,000 GOING TO LOWE'S.
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
PUNCH LINE NUMBER TWO.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING DIRTY.
DID THEY ASK FOR EXCLUSIVITY
FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME?
YEAH, SO THERE'S --
HOW LONG?
SO, THERE'S
A TWO-YEAR EXCLUSIVE IN --
WHOA! NO --
IN THE HOME-IMPROVEMENT
CHANNEL --
ONLY IN THE HOME-IMPROVEMENT
CHANNEL.
IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT --
MM-HMM.
NOW, CAN YOU STILL SELL,
THOUGH, ONLINE?
YEP, MM-HMM.
OH, YES. OH, YES.
AND CAN YOU SELL
TO INDEPENDENTS?
YES.
YES.
AND CAN YOU SELL IT
TO OTHER CORPORATIONS, B2B?
YEAH.
100%, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
GUYS, WHEN I LOOK AT THIS,
I SAY THIS IS A FEATURE,
NOT A PRODUCT.
OKAY.
RIGHT?
YOU'RE A FEATURE
OF THE AUTOMATED HOME.
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT --
WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO
THAT LOWE'S STORE,
THEY ARE LOOKING
TO AUTOMATE THEIR HOMES,
NOT AUTOMATE THEIR VENTS.
MM-HMM.
RIGHT?
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE
AN AUTOMATED CURE FOR THAT.
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.
YOU'RE A LONG WAYS FROM IT.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
Greiner:
HERE'S MY PROBLEM --
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT
WHAT EXACTLY THIS IS GOING TO DO
AND HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.
I GET THE OVERALL CONCEPT.
MM-HMM.
BUT I STILL DON'T HAVE IT
REALLY CLEAR.
AND TO ME,
THAT'S A PROBLEM.
YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING
REALLY FAST,
WHERE PEOPLE STOP IN THE AISLE,
AND THEY GO,
"I KNOW WHAT THAT IS."
BECAUSE I FIND
THAT IT'S CONFUSING,
AND I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE DIFFICULTY
EXPLAINING QUICKLY IN THE RETAIL
STORE WHAT IT IS, I'M OUT.
MY ISSUE'S STRICTLY FINANCIAL
WITH YOU GUYS
'CAUSE I PUT UP $750,000 --
I GET 10%, WHICH IS MARGINAL,
WHICH BOTHERS ME AS A SHARK,
I MUST TELL YOU,
BECAUSE I LIKE DEALS.
WELL, WE LEARNED IT
FROM YOU.
NO, I KNOW, BUT, LISTEN,
I'M LOOKING AT IT, SAYING,
"ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO,
"SOMEBODY ELSE BOUGHT IN
AT UNDER $500,000
OR JUST AROUND $500,000,
AND I'VE GOT TO PAY $750,000."
THAT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME --
I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?
Fant:
WELL, MAKE AN OFFER.
WELL, I THINK, FOR MY VALUE,
WHICH IS ALWAYS A LOT...
Cuban: WAIT FOR IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
...OKAY?
WAIT FOR IT.
...I'M THINKING WHAT MAKES SENSE
IS $750,000 FOR 25%.
IT'S A LITTLE RICH.
NOT REALLY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AND WE HAVE
A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY
TO OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS,
OF COURSE.
NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT
THERE'S ONLY ONE MR. WONDERFUL.
THERE'S VALUE IN THAT.
THANK GOD.
[ LAUGHS ]
I THINK THAT'S
A REASONABLE OFFER, ACTUALLY.
SO, KEVIN'S OFFER
WAS $750,000 FOR 25%.
MM-HMM.
GIVES YOU A VALUE
OF ABOUT $3 MILLION.
MAKES SENSE.
I AGREE WITH KEVIN.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED
ENOUGH UPLIFT IN THE VALUE
FROM THE PERIOD OF TIME.
AH.
ALL RIGHT, DAYMOND,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
$750,000 FOR 25%.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
THAT'S YOUR OFFER. I'M GONNA
MATCH THAT -- $750,000 FOR 25%,
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO MANUFACTURE THE GOODS
IF I CAN MATCH
OR BEAT THE PRICE
SO THAT I CAN MAKE MONEY
ON THAT SIDE.
INTERESTING.
OKAY.
THAT'S INTERESTING.
I'M LOOKING AT
THE COMMERCIAL APPLICATION.
I'M LOOKING AT TRYING TO GO
AND APPROACH HOTELS --
ALL THOSE AREAS
THAT YOU'RE NOT BLOCKED OUT OF
DUE TO LOWE'S,
ALL RIGHT? SO --
WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS
WITH A VERY LARGE HOTEL CHAIN
TO PLACE THESE INTO
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR ROOMS
ALL ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.
WELL, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE EFFICIENCY MATTERS.
MM-HMM. MM-HMM. YEP.
IF YOU HAVE 3,000 OR 2,000
ROOMS, YOU CAN CUT THEM OFF.
YEP.
MM-HMM.
Herjavec:
I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB.
YOU'RE A FEATURE,
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
ONCE CISCO CONTROLLED
THE BIG I.T. MARKET...
SURE, MM-HMM.
...AND THERE'S
LOTS OF LITTLE COMPANIES
THAT CONTROL FEATURES
OF IT.
MM-HMM.
SO, I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
TODAY, IT'S VENTS,
TOMORROW, IT'S THAT.
CORRECT.
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY NEED
THE HELP
WITH THE MANUFACTURING.
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE ON TRACK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
<i>I'M</i> GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
THIS IS WHERE HE TRIES
TO STAB US IN THE BACK.
Narrator: TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
NAYEEM AND RYAN HAVE
TWO OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FROM DAYMOND AND KEVIN FOR
THEIR SMART AIR VENT, KEEN HOME,
BUT ROBERT IS ALSO INTERESTED.
SO, DAYMOND AND KEVIN
ARE $750,000 FOR 25%.
I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE RICH.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $750,000
FOR 20%.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER.
THAT'S A GOOD OFFER.
THAT'S STILL A DOWN ROUND.
IT'S STILL A DOWN ROUND.
THAT'S CORRECT.
IT'S STILL A DOWN ROUND.
DOWN ROUNDS SEND ALL KINDS OF
SIGNALS IN THE MARKETPLACE,
AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW,
AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE'RE LOOKING
TO ENTERTAIN RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, I'LL SOLVE
YOUR PROBLEM FOR YOU.
LET'S GO DEBT, ALL RIGHT?
YOU'LL GIVE ME THE 10%,
I'LL GIVE YOU VENTURE DEBT.
I'LL GIVE YOU $750,000
AT 8.5%, OKAY?
MM-HMM.
AND I WANT 10% EQUITY
FOR THAT.
MM-HMM.
I'LL PUT THE MONEY UP
FOR 36 MONTHS, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
BUT IT SOLVES YOUR DOWN-ROUND
PROBLEM, AND YOU GET A SHARK.
I WOULD BE WILLING TO GO IN
WITH KEVIN ON HIS DEAL.
YOU WANT
TO GO 50-50?
WHERE YOU'RE AT, VENTURE DEBT
IS NOT A BAD OPTION FOR YOU.
SURE.
IF LORI COMES IN WITH ME,
YOU GET TWO SHARKS,
AND YOU DO NOT DO A DOWN ROUND.
RIGHT, BUT I WANT 25%.
A DOWN ROUND, MAN.
NO, HOLD ON.
THEY CALL HIM
"MR. DOWN ROUND."
I CAN -- I CAN CARVE IT
A DIFFERENT WAY.
DAYMOND, THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO
THE DOWN ROUND.
ARE YOU PARTNERS
WITH THEM ALREADY?
I THINK THE LOAN OFFER
IS INTERESTING.
I GET WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
A DOWN ROUND.
I RESPECT THAT.
WHAT I'M REALLY FASCINATED BY
IS THE COMPLIANCE
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
IN THIS INDUSTRY.
IT'S GONNA BE DRIVEN
BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES
FOR SMARTER HOMES.
YEP. MM-HMM. MM-HMM.
AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA TAKE
ALL OF THIS TO ANOTHER LEVEL.
WE AGREE.
MM-HMM.
$750,000 FOR 13% --
THAT'S MY OFFER.
OKAY.
O'Leary: THAT DEAL'S GONNA
COST YOU MORE EQUITY.
I HAVE A LOT OF PRODUCTS
THAT ARE FITTING
IN THE HARDWARE SPACE.
WE'RE IN LOWE'S, WE'RE IN
HOME DEPOT, BED BATH &amp; BEYOND.
THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES
YOU CAN GO.
AGREED.
MM-HMM.
UM, I'LL --
I'M WILLING TO GO DOWN MORE
TO, UH, $750,000 FOR 20%.
YOU DON'T HAVE
PROOF OF CONCEPT YET.
YOU HAVE A GREAT START
BECAUSE OF THE LOWE'S --
DOESN'T MEAN
LOWE'S IS GONNA SELL IT,
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GONNA WORK
OVER THERE.
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY.
I NEVER LIKE TO TAKE DEBT
WHEN I'M AT THIS STAGE.
I'M AN ALL-IN KIND OF GUY
WHEN YOU'RE THIS SMALL.
WHEN YOU GET BIGGER,
SURE, TAKE ON DEBT,
BUT WHEN YOU'RE SMALL,
YOU GOT TO DRIVE IT, BABY.
YOU GOT TO GO.
BUT YOU'LL HAVE
SO MANY SALES,
AND YOU'LL HAVE SO MUCH MONEY,
IT WON'T MATTER.
THOSE ARE THE OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WE'RE LOOKING FOR,
AT THIS STAGE OF OUR COMPANY,
A REAL PARTNER WHO'S GONNA
JUMP ALL-IN AND --
AND TAKE THIS WILD
RIDE WITH US.
OH, THANKS.
OH, HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.
I THINK
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.
SO -- SO WE'D -- WE'D LOVE
TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER, ROBERT.
WAIT. WHAT IS THAT?
Greiner: GOOD DEAL.
AH.
CONGRATS, ROBERT.
I LOVE IT. THANK YOU.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
WELCOME TO THE KEEN --
FOR SURE.
YEAH, GREAT JOB, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: CONGRATS, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
THANKS.
THANKS, GUYS.
BYE.
Herjavec:
YEAH. THANK YOU.
MAN, WHATEVER, ROBERT.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
Hussain: ROBERT REALLY SEEMED
TO UNDERSTAND THE BRAND VISION.
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO
BUILD BRANDS, BUILD COMPANIES,
AND REALLY, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
BUILD STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A PRODUCT DESIGNED
TO HELP STUDENTS WITH
THE HIGH COST OF COLLEGE.
HI, SHARKS.
