HI, SHARKS. I'M JACK.
AND I'M ALLEY.
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF TAALUMA TOTES.
WE'RE HERE SEEKING $110,000
FOR 15% OF OUR COMPANY.
IT'S TIME TO KICK
THOSE BORING, GENERIC BACKPACKS
TO THE CURB.
ALLEY AND I
WENT TO UGANDA
DURING A SUMMER BREAK
FROM COLLEGE,
AND WE COULDN'T
TAKE OUR EYES OFF
ALL THE CRAZY FABRICS THERE.
SO, WE PICKED OUT A FABRIC
AT THE LOCAL MARKET
AND FOUND A SEAMSTRESS
TO SEW ALLEY A BEAUTIFUL SKIRT.
AND JACK
GOT A LITTLE JEALOUS,
'CAUSE HE COULDN'T
PULL OFF A SKIRT,
SO HE CAME UP
WITH ANOTHER IDEA.
HE HANDED THE SEAMSTRESS
HIS BORING, GENERIC,
SOLID-BLACK BACKPACK
AND ASKED HER TO MAKE
A MORE EXCITING ONE
OUT OF THE LOCAL FABRIC.
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
THE TAALUMA TOTE WAS BORN.
SO, TAALUMA TOTES ARE BACKPACKS
PAIRED WITH COUNTRIES.
EACH ONE IS MADE OF TRADITIONAL
FABRIC FROM THAT COUNTRY
AND THEN FUNDS A MICROLOAN
FOR A PERSON IN THAT COUNTRY.
SO, WHEN YOU CARRY TAALUMA,
YOU CARRY A COUNTRY.
SO, WE STARTED THE BUSINESS
FROM OUR COLLEGE APARTMENT.
AND WITH GRADUATION
AROUND THE CORNER
AND TAALUMA'S MOMENTUM
REALLY BUILDING,
WE TRADED OUR CALCULATORS IN
FOR TOTES
AND MADE THIS
NIGHTS-AND-WEEKENDS PROJECT
OUR FULL-TIME JOBS.
SO, SHARKS,
THE QUESTION IS...
Both:
...WHICH COUNTRY WILL YOU CARRY?
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE'D LIKE TO PASS OUT
SOME SAMPLES, AS WELL,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
JACK, WHERE'D
YOU GO TO SCHOOL?
WE BOTH WENT
TO VIRGINIA TECH.
WE STUDIED
ENGINEERING THERE.
ALLEY,
WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS?
THAT ONE'S
AN INDONESIA TOTE.
Greiner:
WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS?
MALI.
MALI?
THAT'S RIGHT.
BEAUTIFUL.
AND A BEAUT --
THIS IS MR. WONDERFUL.
WE KNOW YOU LIKE GREEN, SO WE
PICKED YOU THE GREEN INDIA TOTE.
THANK YOU.
John: THANK YOU.
DAYMOND,
THAT'S THE GHANA TOTE,
AND, MARK,
THE IVORY COAST.
SO, EACH OF THESE BACKPACKS
HAVE A STORY.
THIS ONE FUNDED A MICROLOAN
FOR AN ARTIST IN INDONESIA
TO BUY MORE CRAFTS
AND SUPPLIES.
AND EACH STOR--
EACH TOTE HAS A STORY LIKE THAT.
JACK, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
IT REALLY IS,
AND IT'S BEAUTIFULLY MADE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THE QUALITY IS INCREDIBLE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WE'VE SOLD $60,000 OF BACKPACKS
IN THE PAST 10 MONTHS,
AND THAT'S FUNDED $6,000
IN MICROLOANS.
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOUR DAD
LET YOU GO TO UGANDA?
[ LAUGHTER ]
MY DAD IS
IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT,
SO I MOVED AROUND THE WORLD
MY WHOLE LIFE.
YOU SAY THAT THESE
ARE DIFFERENT TERRITORIES.
ARE YOU ACTUALLY MAKING THEM
IN THE TERRITORY,
OR THE FABRIC IS JUST
INSPIRED BY IT?
SO, WE GET TRADITIONAL FABRICS
FROM THE COUNTRIES.
ALL OF THE FABRICS COME
TO WHERE THEY'RE MADE,
OUTSIDE OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA,
AND THEY'RE ASSEMBLED THERE.
AND WHY DON'T YOU MAKE THEM
IN THOSE COUNTRIES?
BECAUSE THAT ALSO
HELPS PROVIDE JOBS.
WE ACTUALLY
DID CONSIDER THAT,
BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT PROVIDING
SOME LOCAL BENEFITS HERE
IN THE U.S., AS WELL.
THE FACILITY THAT MAKES THEM
HIRES ADULTS
WITH DISABILITIES
TO HELP
DO THE ASSEMBLY, SO...
OKAY.
WOW.
Greiner:
I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
JACK, WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?
$65.
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT, ALL-IN?
$27.
John: I WOULD PAY MORE
FOR THIS BAG.
WHY ISN'T IT $100?
WELL, SO,
OUR TARGET MARKET
IS COLLEGE STUDENTS
AND YOUNG ADULTS.
Greiner: I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
WRONG IN YOUR PRICE POINT.
KIDS ARE
ON A BUDGET, RIGHT?
YOU'RE MAKING IT
AFFORDABLE TO MANY,
AS OPPOSED TO JUST A FEW.
Herjavec: WHAT --
WHAT'S THE LARGER STRATEGY?
HOW IS THE BUSINESS
GONNA GET BIGGER?
WELL, SO,
THAT'S WHAT PART OF THE MONEY
IS GONNA BE ALLOCATED FOR.
WE WANT TO EXPAND
OUR CAMPUS AMBASSADOR PROGRAM.
DO YOU HAVE THE AMBASSADOR
PROGRAM IN PLACE TODAY?
WE'VE --
ON A VERY SMALL SCALE, YES.
SO, WE'RE FINDING TWO STUDENTS
ON EACH CAMPUS
TO REPRESENT TAALUMA TOTES
AND SPREAD THE WORD
ON THEIR CAMPUS.
DO THEY GET PAID
FOR THIS ACTIVITY?
THIS ACTUALLY CAME
FROM AN INSANE NUMBER OF E-MAILS
THAT WE GET FROM STUDENTS
JUST ASKING TO BE INVOLVED.
SO, THEY JUST WANT
TO HELP THE CAUSE?
YEAH, THERE'S NO PAYROLL
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
O'Leary: DON'T WORRY --
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,
YOU'LL TURN INTO
A CAPITALIST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOW -- HOW ARE YOU DOING
THE MICROLOANS?
I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT.
YEAH, SO, IT IS A LOAN.
IT'S A SMALL LOAN
THAT'S GIVEN TO AN ENTREPRENEUR
IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS.
RIGHT.
ONCE THEY CAN DO THAT
AND GENERATE THEIR OWN INCOME,
THEY PAY IT BACK
WITHIN 12 MONTHS,
AND WE USE THAT MONEY
TO BUY FABRIC FROM THAT COUNTRY
FOR THE NEXT BACKPACK,
CLOSING THE LOOP.
Herjavec:
JACK, ALLEY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
YOU KNOW, YOU TOOK AN IDEA,
YOU RAN WITH IT.
I THINK THE PRODUCT
IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE --
WE'RE HERE TO HELP BUSINESSES
WHERE OUR CAPITAL
AND EXPERTISE
CAN TAKE THEM
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, REALLY,
THIS INVESTMENT
IS GONNA KICK IT -- KICK-START
US UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
I MEAN, THE THINGS THAT ARE
HOLDING US BACK -- INVENTORY.
WE'VE RUN OUT A FEW TIMES
IN THE PAST 10 MONTHS
BECAUSE WE COULDN'T KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.
RIGHT, BUT THEY
ALREADY HAVE TO BE
AT A CERTAIN LEVEL
TO SPRINGBOARD.
I THINK THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT THE STRATEGY,
THE PRICE POINT, YOU KNOW,
THE AMBASSADOR PROGRAM.
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.
I JUST THINK
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY.
I'M OUT.
WE'RE MOVING QUICK.
WE'RE -- I MEAN,
WE'RE FAST LEARNERS AND --
OH, YOU ARE, AND --
AND YOU'RE GOING TO,
AND THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN,
RIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE GONNA TRY,
YOU'RE GONNA FAIL,
YOU'RE GONNA FALL DOWN,
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT?
PICK --
PICK RIGHT BACK UP.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR 10 MONTHS.
GUYS, WHAT I SEE,
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD --
GREAT PRODUCT, BUT YOU'RE
A PRODUCT, NOT A COMPANY.
LIKE YOU SAID, YOU'VE FALLEN
DOWN, AND YOU'VE GOTTEN BACK UP.
YOU HAVEN'T FALLEN DOWN
ENOUGH YET.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE THANK YOU, ANYWAY.
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, WHEN
I FIRST STARTED MY BUSINESS,
I HAD ONE PRODUCT IDEA,
SAME AS YOU,
AND ONE OF
THE GREATEST THINGS FOR ME WAS
THAT I HAD TO
FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT.
I WAS ALONE.
BUT AS I GREW A BUSINESS,
I THEN KNEW
HOW TO RUN ALL FACETS OF IT,
AND I COULD CONTINUE
TO MAKE MORE AND MORE PRODUCTS.
I THINK YOU HAVE
ALL THESE STEPS AHEAD OF YOU.
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,
IF YOU LEARN THEM,
YOU'RE GONNA BECOME
MUCH STRONGER.
BUT FOR ME, IT'S TOO EARLY.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
John: I HAVE TO TAKE --
MY HAT'S OFF TO YOU
BECAUSE TOO MANY KIDS THESE DAYS
ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE MONEY
AND DEVELOP AN APP BECAUSE
THAT'S THE NEW GOLD RUSH,
AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING
TO MAKE CHANGE.
[ CHUCKLES ] THANK YOU.
HERE WAS MY CHALLENGE --
YOU REALLY WEREN'T THINKING
ABOUT THE MARGIN,
AND THAT MEANS
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN
AT THE CURRENT PRICE.
AND I SAY THIS
TO ONE COMPANY EVERY SEASON --
FIRST YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT,
THEN YOU HAVE TO MASTER IT,
AND <i>THEN</i> YOU CAN MATTER.
I'M OUT.
Herjavec: WELL, THERE'S
ONLY ONE COUNTRY LEFT.
KEVIN?
I HAD A LITTLE CONNECTION
WITH THIS WHEN ALLEY SAID
THAT HER DAD WORKED AT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT AND TRAVELED A LOT.
THAT WAS ALSO MY STORY.
I LIVED IN CAMBODIA, TUNISIA,
ETHIOPIA, CYPRUS, JAPAN,
SWITZERLAND, FRANCE.
WOW.
EVERY TWO YEARS, WE MOVED.
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS,
YOU KNOW,
AND I ALWAYS
GET DRAGGED BACK TO REALITY,
BUT THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT MYSELF.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
"MR. WONDERFUL."
YOU GUYS ARE NOT WORTH
$700,000 -- NOWHERE NEAR IT.
IT'S WAY, WAY, WAY TOO EARLY.
BUT I DON'T THINK YOUR COMPANY'S
EVEN WORTH $110,000 YET.
SO, AS FAR AS
THE VALUATION GOES,
WE'RE VALUING THE COMPANY
ON SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.
AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
FROM THIS --
THESE FIRST FEW MONTHS
WAS HOW TO BUILD A COMMUNITY
AROUND OUR MISSION,
RATHER THAN JUST SELL A PRODUCT
TO A CUSTOMER.
AND THAT IS SO MUCH MORE
VALUABLE
AND SO MUCH MORE GENUINE,
AS YOU --
NO, YOU'RE -- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S --
IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO STRETCH,
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS
WHEN YOU END UP
IN FRONT OF A FINANCIAL INVESTOR
LIKE ME,
WHO'S GOT TREMENDOUS DISCIPLINE,
'CAUSE HE'S BEEN AROUND
A LONG TIME,
I LOOK FOR THE POTENTIAL
OF FREE CASH FLOW
IN THE NEXT 36 MONTHS.
THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN DETERMINE
WHETHER THIS IS A HOBBY
OR A BUSINESS.
LOOK, YOU'RE
WAY TOO EMBRYONIC FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU, ANYWAYS.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.
MAYBE WE CHOSE THE WRONG
STRATEGY IN OUR FIRST YEAR.
WE SHOULD HAVE
CHASED THE --
Cuban: NO, NO, NO.
YOU JUST -- YOU --
YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS,
AND YOU LEARN.
OKAY.
IT JUST DOESN'T ALL HAPPEN
IN ONE YEAR.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
RIGHT.
IT TAKES TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK.
THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.
Alley: THANKS.
John:
I LOVE ENTREPRENEURS LIKE THIS.
I LOVE THEM.
THEY WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE,
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE A CHANGE
IF YOU DON'T STAY IN BUSINESS.
I PROBABLY WOULD PAY $200
FOR THIS IF I --
ESPECIALLY WITH THE STORY,
IF YOU KNEW THE STORY.
WITH THE STORY,
I WOULD PAY $200 FOR THIS,
AND I WOULD BE PROUD.
