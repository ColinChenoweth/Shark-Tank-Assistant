GREETINGS, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DAVE GOODMAN.
I'M FROM NEW YORK CITY, AND
MY COMPANY IS CALLED COCO JACK.
I'M HERE ASKING FOR $125,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
SHARKS,
THESE ARE YOUNG THAI COCONUTS.
THEY'RE ENJOYED BY HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.
THERE'S JUST ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.
IT'S HOW YOU USUALLY
GET INTO THEM.
OH, MY GOD.
DO YOU EVER MISS?
WE GET E-MAILS ALL THE TIME
FROM PEOPLE WHO DO.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S GOT TO BE
AN EASIER WAY.
AND NOW THERE IS.
INTRODUCING THE COCO JACK.
COCO JACK OPENS
YOUNG THAI COCONUTS SAFELY
IN JUST A FEW SECONDS, NO MATTER
YOUR SIZE OR STRENGTH.
WE'VE HAD ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE
DOING THIS,
FROM 4-YEAR-OLD KIDS TO LITTLE
OLD LADIES, EVERYONE IN BETWEEN.
JUST LIKE THAT, AND THERE --
YOU'RE IN.
JUST TAKES A FEW SECONDS.
Herjavec: CAN I TRY IT, DAVE?
OF COURSE, YEAH.
DO YOU HAVE TO
FLIP THE HAMMER?
YES, THAT'S IN THE INSTRUCTIONS.
[ LAUGHS ]
THERE YOU GO. WHO ELSE
WANTS TO COME UP AND TRY IT?
WHOA, ROBERT.
SURE.
Herjavec:
GIVE ME A COCONUT, DAVE.
Goodman:
RIGHT. HERE YOU GO.
SO, THE COCO JACK GOES
ON TOP OF THE COCONUT LIKE THIS.
YOU WANT TO HIT IT
A FEW TIMES.
DAMN, KEVIN!
COME ON, KEVIN!
ALL RIGHT, DOWN, BOY,
DOWN, BOY, DOWN, BOY.
LITTLE OVERKILL. THAT'S
WHAT WE CALL COCO THERAPY.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY.
AND YOU'RE IN, YEAH.
THAT'S PLENTY.
GIVE IT ONE MORE FOR GOOD LUCK
IN THE FRONT.
HAVE YOU TRIED
THESE COCONUTS BEFORE?
NO.
YOU HAVEN'T?
NO. CAN I TRY?
HERE'S A STRAW.
OF COURSE.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
ENJOY.
Greiner:
SO, I HAVE A QUESTION.
WHERE DO YOU GET
THE COCONUTS LIKE THAT?
THEY COME LIKE THIS FROM
THAILAND. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
THAI COCONUTS ARE
THE SWEETEST COCONUTS ON EARTH.
YOU CAN GET THEM
AT ANY ASIAN MARKET,
MOST MEXICAN/LATINO MARKETS,
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS,
AND ALMOST ANY WHOLE FOODS
OR HEALTH FOOD STORE.
THE BEST PART OF THE COCONUT
IS ACTUALLY THE MEAT.
AND WE HAVE A STAINLESS-STEEL
SCOOP TOOL, AS WELL,
THAT'LL GET ALL THE MEAT OUT.
IS THAT <i>YOUR</i> TOOL?
YES, SIR.
THIS IS A BIG, BIG SELLING POINT
FOR THE TOOL, AS WELL.
ALL THE MEAT'S GONNA COME OUT
JUST LIKE THAT IN ONE PIECE.
Greiner: OH, WOW.
THAT, TO ME, IS MORE IMPRESSIVE
THAN THE FIRST PRODUCT.
WHAT DO YOU GET
IN THE COCO JACK PACKAGE?
THIS IS IN THE COCO PACK, AND
THAT COMES IN THE BURLAP SACK
THAT SHOULD BE OVER THERE
IN FRONT OF YOU.
DAVE, I'VE HEARD THAT
DRINKING EXCESSIVE COCONUT WATER
ACTUALLY CAUSES
A LAXATIVE EFFECT.
ANY TRUTH TO THAT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
BUT, YEAH, I THINK
THERE CAN BE A CLEANSING EFFECT.
O'Leary:
GIVE ANOTHER ONE TO BARBARA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE YOU GO.
Herjavec: AND IT'S VERY, VERY
HEALTHY FOR YOU, RIGHT, DAVE?
IT'S EXTREMELY HEALTHY.
IT'S VERY HYDRATING.
IT'S FULL OF ELECTROLYTES.
IT'S VERY GOOD. SWEET.
TASTES LIKE CORN.
Corcoran: HOW DOES A GUY
LIKE YOU COME UP WITH AN IDEA
OF BEING
IN THE COCONUT BUSINESS,
AND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT
OUTFIT IN A TOWN LIKE NEW YORK?
YOU DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.
I KNOW. I'M A COMPLICATED GUY.
AND I'M ACTUALLY
FROM NEW YORK CITY.
I SOLD MY APARTMENT IN NEW YORK
2 1/2 YEARS AGO
TO LIVE FULL-TIME ON THE ROAD.
I BOUGHT FOUR R.V.s.
AND I'M PREP-SCHOOL RAISED.
AT 14 YEARS OLD, I HAD
A CLASSICAL MUSIC CONVERSION.
WENT TO JUILLIARD
AS A PERCUSSIONIST, A COMPOSER.
WOW.
I WAS A CONDUCTOR.
I WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA.
I STARTED STUDYING ECONOMICS.
I STARTED STUDYING
MYTHOLOGY, POLITICS.
BECAME A PRIVATE PILOT
IN COLORADO.
THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH COCONUTS?
I'M GETTING THERE.
A FRIEND OF MINE TURNED ME ON
TO A RAW VEGAN DIET,
AND COCONUTS WERE A BIG PART
OF THE REGIME.
AND I OPENED THEM ALL THE TIME
WITH MY CLEAVER, AND I SAID,
"THERE'S GOT TO BE
A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS."
THIS IS
A VERY INTERESTING STORY,
BUT I MISSED THE PART
WHERE I MAKE THE MONEY.
Greiner: OKAY, SO WHO IS SELLING
THE COCO JACK RIGHT NOW?
ME. PRIMARILY THROUGH
OUR WEBSITE.
Herjavec:
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
ABOUT 325,000
IN 9 MONTHS.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
AVERAGE ABOUT $60.
WHAT'S YOUR COST
TO MAKE IT?
RIGHT NOW,
THEY'RE MADE IN THE U.S.A.
FOR THESE TOOLS, ABOUT $26.
WHEN THIS WAS
A GLIMMER IN YOUR EYE,
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT,
HOW MANY YEARS
DID IT TAKE YOU TO GO FROM
GLIMMER TO AN ACTUAL PRODUCT?
I HAD THE IDEA
ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO.
12 YEARS TO GET YOUR PRODUCT
OFF THE GROUND?
WELL, I WASN'T TRYING
FOR 12 YEARS.
YOU WEREN'T PASSIONATE ENOUGH
TO, LIKE, DIVE IN?
I WAS OCCUPIED
WITH OTHER THINGS.
I WAS PASSIONATE
ABOUT OTHER THINGS AT THE TIME.
ONCE I GOT INTO IT, I THOUGHT,
"OKAY, I'M MAKING THIS
FOR 20,000, 50,000,
MAYBE A MILLION RAW FOODISTS
IN VENICE BEACH
AND ORANGE COUNTY."
WHEN I STARTED DOING
CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT,
PEOPLE SAID, "NO, DAVE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
"EVERY THAI RESTAURANT,
EVERY VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT,
ALL THE PAN-ASIAN RESTAURANTS,
THEY ALL SELL COCONUTS."
I'M CURIOUS
HOW ORGANIZED YOU ARE.
HMM. GREAT QUESTION.
I PREFER CREATIVE THINKING.
I ALSO BELIEVE IN OUTSOURCING
STUFF I'M NOT GOOD AT.
I HAVE THREE PEOPLE
WHO ARE BEAN COUNTERS,
NO. OKAY. SO --
AND THEY'RE VERY AGGRESSIVE
ABOUT THAT.
AND I'M NOT GONNA
SPEND MY ENERGY --
OKAY. TIME OUT.
WANT TO GET A WORD IN HERE.
EVERY TIME I INVESTED
IN AN ENTREPRENEUR
WHO WASN'T ORGANIZED
OR HAD A RIGHT-HAND PERSON THAT
TOTALLY ORGANIZED THE BUSINESS,
GUESS WHAT?
THEY NEVER DELIVER.
MY --
OKAY.
THAT'S A FAIR CRITICISM.
SO, FOR SIMPLY THE REASON
OF LACK OF ORGANIZATION,
WHICH I BELIEVE
I'M RIGHT ON,
I HAVE TO BE OUT.
WELL, I HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
OKAY.
AND I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS
FOR YOU.
THE GOOD NEWS IS
I LOVE IT.
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE
A MARKET FOR THIS.
IT'S GOT MERIT,
IT'S USEFUL,
AND YOU WILL SELL THEM
TO SOME PEOPLE.
OH, YEAH.
BUT TO THE BAD NEWS,
I'M OUT...
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A BIG-ENOUGH MARKET
FOR ME TO INVEST IN IT.
DAVE, I REALLY LIKE
THE IDEA.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
I MEAN, I LOVE STUFF THAT IS
OBTUSE, THAT IS VERY UNIQUE,
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE,
KIND OF LIKE YOU.
YOU THINK?
BUT I DON'T SEE
THE NEXT STEP.
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary: OKAY, DAVE.
I'VE GOT A LITTLE STORY FOR YOU.
THIS VARIETY OF COCONUT
IS PROMINENT IN CAMBODIA,
WHERE I GREW UP
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.
MY HOUSEKEEPERS BACK THEN
USED TO TAKE ME TO THE MARKET
EVERY MORNING,
AND I WOULD WATCH IN FASCINATION
WITH THE MASTERY THEY HAD
TO CARVE IT INTO THIS SHAPE
AND THEN KNOCK THE TOP OFF,
PUT A WOODEN STRAW IN IT,
AND THAT WAS MY BREAKFAST.
I LOVE THAT.
SO, BECAUSE I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE
WITH THE COCONUT
AND I FEEL THE CONNECTION,
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000
FOR 50%.
FIVE-ZERO PERCENT?
YEAH.
$125,000 FOR 50%?
CORRECT, ROBERT.
GET THE MACHETE, DAVE!
YOU'RE NOT A BUSINESS YET.
YOU'RE A PRODUCT.
THERE'S A LOT
THAT CAN GO WRONG
TURNING IT
INTO A BUSINESS.
I THINK I'VE MADE YOU
A FAIR OFFER.
I'VE GIVEN YOU $125,000
TO BECOME A PARTNER.
HAS ANYBODY ELSE
STEPPED UP?
SO, DAVE, OKAY.
SO, I LIKE THE IDEA.
WHEN PEOPLE SOLVE PROBLEMS
THAT NOBODY KNEW
NEEDED TO BE SOLVED...
YEAH.
...INDUSTRIES ARE BORN.
INDUSTRIES?
SHUT UP, SCOOBY-DOO.
IF -- IF I SAY, "LOOK, WE CAN GO
AFTER BARS AND RESTAURANTS,
BUT WE CAN'T
GO AFTER SOMETHING ELSE,"
CAN YOU FOCUS
ON ONE THING AT A TIME?
ABSOLUTELY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DEBT
IN THE COMPANY NOW?
ABOUT $13,000.
OKAY.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $125,000
STRUCTURED AS CONVERTIBLE DEBT
WITH A 7% INTEREST RATE.
WHAT THAT MEANS IS
I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU
TO PAY ME BACK INITIALLY, RIGHT?
IT'S JUST GONNA
STAY ON YOUR BOOKS AS DEBT.
RIGHT.
IF BUSINESS GOES GREAT,
WE'LL CONVERT THAT TO EQUITY,
AND I'LL JUST BE
AN EQUITY SHAREHOLDER.
WHAT I WANT THAT TO CONVERT TO
IS 25% OF THE COMPANY.
O'Leary:
DAVE, AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING
WITH CERTAINTY.
IF THINGS DON'T GO WELL AND YOU
TAKE ON THAT CONVERTIBLE DEBT,
YOUR PATENT AND THE OWNERSHIP
OF YOUR PRODUCT
WILL REVERT
TO THAT CONVERTIBLE DEBT OWNER.
MINE HAS NO DEBT COVENANTS.
WE'RE TOTALLY ALIGNED,
100% ALIGNED AS PARTNERS.
I DO WANT TO SEE
IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED
IN GOING DOWN TO 20%
FOR THE EQUITY CONVERSION.
NO.
LOOK, YOU TAKE EQUITY,
OR YOU TAKE DEBT.
ONE OTHER THING JUST TO ADD IN.
DAVE, YOU GOT TO
CLOSE THE DEAL!
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE.
ARE YOU TAKING DEBT OR EQUITY?
THAT'S YOUR DECISION, DAVE.
I THINK YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST MAN
IN THE WORLD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVE A SINGLE OFFER.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, DAVE?
YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT.
I'LL TAKE IT. I'M SOLD.
WE GOT A DEAL?
WE GOT A DEAL.
LET'S DO IT.
DEAL.
THANK YOU, MARK.
APPRECIATE IT, BRO.
THANKS, BRO.
WE'LL DO THIS.
COCONUTS FOREVER.
RIGHT ON.
LATER, GUYS.
THANKS. YOU WERE AWESOME.
GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT!
THANKS.
IT'S BEEN A LONG
AND WINDING JOURNEY.
I'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF THINGS
IN MY LIFE.
I'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IN ALL OF THEM.
AND THIS IS BRINGING ME
INTO THE PEER GROUP OF PEOPLE
WHO ARE MASTER SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE
LIKE MARK.
I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR THAT.
