GREETINGS, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DAVE GOODMAN.
JUST TAKES A FEW SECONDS.
Herjavec: CAN I TRY IT, DAVE?
OF COURSE, YEAH.
DO YOU HAVE TO
FLIP THE HAMMER?
YES, THAT'S IN THE INSTRUCTIONS.
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec:
GIVE ME A COCONUT, DAVE.
Goodman:
RIGHT. HERE YOU GO.
SO, THE COCO JACK GOES
ON TOP OF THE COCONUT LIKE THIS.
YOU WANT TO HIT IT
A FEW TIMES.
DAMN, KEVIN!
COME ON, KEVIN!
ALL RIGHT, DOWN, BOY,
DOWN, BOY, DOWN, BOY.
LITTLE OVERKILL. THAT'S
WHAT WE CALL COCO THERAPY.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY.
DAVE, I'VE HEARD THAT
DRINKING EXCESSIVE COCONUT WATER
ACTUALLY CAUSES
A LAXATIVE EFFECT.
ANY TRUTH TO THAT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
BUT, YEAH, I THINK
THERE CAN BE A CLEANSING EFFECT.
O'Leary:
GIVE ANOTHER ONE TO BARBARA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE YOU GO.
DAVE, I REALLY LIKE
THE IDEA.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
I MEAN, I LOVE STUFF THAT IS
OBTUSE, THAT IS VERY UNIQUE,
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE,
KIND OF LIKE YOU.
YOU THINK?
BUT I DON'T SEE
THE NEXT STEP.
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary: OKAY, DAVE.
I'VE GOT A LITTLE STORY FOR YOU.
THIS VARIETY OF COCONUT
IS PROMINENT IN CAMBODIA,
WHERE I GREW UP
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.
MY HOUSEKEEPERS BACK THEN
USED TO TAKE ME TO THE MARKET
EVERY MORNING,
GET THE MACHETE, DAVE!
YOU'RE NOT A BUSINESS YET.
YOU'RE A PRODUCT.
THERE'S A LOT
THAT CAN GO WRONG
TURNING IT
INTO A BUSINESS.
I THINK I'VE MADE YOU
A FAIR OFFER.
I'VE GIVEN YOU $125,000
TO BECOME A PARTNER.
HAS ANYBODY ELSE
STEPPED UP?
SO, DAVE, OKAY.
SO, I LIKE THE IDEA.
WHEN PEOPLE SOLVE PROBLEMS
THAT NOBODY KNEW
NEEDED TO BE SOLVED...
YEAH.
...INDUSTRIES ARE BORN.
INDUSTRIES?
SHUT UP, SCOOBY-DOO.
DAVE, YOU GOT TO
CLOSE THE DEAL!
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE.
ARE YOU TAKING DEBT OR EQUITY?
THAT'S YOUR DECISION, DAVE.
I THINK YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST MAN
IN THE WORLD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVE A SINGLE OFFER.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, DAVE?
YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT.
I'LL TAKE IT. I'M SOLD.
WE GOT A DEAL?
WE GOT A DEAL.
LET'S DO IT.
DEAL.
THANK YOU, MARK.
APPRECIATE IT, BRO.
THANKS, BRO.
WE'LL DO THIS.
COCONUTS FOREVER.
RIGHT ON.
LATER, GUYS.
THANKS. YOU WERE AWESOME.
GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT!
THANKS.
