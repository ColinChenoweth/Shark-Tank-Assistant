HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS GEORGE CONWAY,
WHO'S "WE," GEORGE?
MY BEST FRIEND, KERRY.
MM-HMM.
THE ACTUAL INVENTOR.
GEORGE, I SEE THE SKIES
RAINING DOWN WITH LITIGATION.
THE FLAW IS,
EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S ILLEGAL
TO RIDE IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP.
I THOUGHT IT WAS.
QUITE FRANKLY, IT IS.
HOWEVER --
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOWEVER, IT IS ILLEGAL TO RIDE
IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK
UNRESTRAINED.
WE'VE HAD IT
INDEPENDENTLY TESTED,
SO, GEORGE, IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA GROW THE BUSINESS?
IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA SCALE?
I HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT OTHER WAYS
THAT I AM GOING TO GROW
THIS COMPANY.
THE FIRST
IS I HAVE 800 PEOPLE
I <i>LOVE</i>
THE WAY YOU SELL, GEORGE.
YOU ARE A GOOD SALESPERSON.
Corcoran: VERY GOOD.
Herjavec:
WHERE ARE YOU MAKING THESE?
EVERYTHING IS MADE IN AMERICA.
THE FRAME IS WHAT
WE MANUFACTURE.
GEORGE, WHAT'S IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?
$300.
I SELL THEM FOR $699 A SET.
GEORGE, IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, MY FRIEND.
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MANUFACTURING
THIS FOR, LIKE, 100 BUCKS
TO PUT IT INTO WHOLESALE
AT $300
IN ORDER TO SELL IT AT RETAIL
AT $500 TO $600.
EXACTLY.
SO, HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?
HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT?
I HAVE THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION, BY THE WAY.
HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH.
I WILL BUY 1,000 UNITS.
IF I GET $200,000,
GEORGE, I WANT TO HIRE <i>YOU.</i>
I LOVE YOU, GEORGE.
FORGET THE BUSINESS.
I JUST WANT TO HIRE YOU.
O'Leary: JUST LOVE
LISTENING TO YOU. YOU'RE GREAT,
BUT I WANT YOU,
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK,
O'Leary:
OKAY, LOOK, GEORGE.
I'D LIKE YOU
TO GET RID OF THIS THING
SO YOU CAN GO SELL SOMETHING
WHERE YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
I REALLY WOULD.
HOWEVER, ON THIS
PARTICULAR IDEA, I'M OUT.
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
GUYS, LET ME STEP IN.
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
LOVE YOU.
LOOK, YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYBODY
IT'S A HUGELY
CASH-INTENSIVE BUSINESS.
ABSOLUTELY.
CASH-INTENSIVE
DOESN'T BOTHER ME
Herjavec: GEORGE, I THINK
YOU DID A GOOD JOB TODAY.
GREAT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I JUST DON'T SEE IT
REPLACING S.U.V.s.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
Corcoran: FOR ME...
I THINK THIS IS
A PHENOMENAL IDEA.
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
SAYS FUN, FUN, FUN,
