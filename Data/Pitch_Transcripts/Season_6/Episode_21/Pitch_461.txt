TO BUILDING THE CITY'S PREMIER
$2 BILLION REAL-ESTATE EMPIRE.
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,
FOUNDED ONE OF
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A UNIQUE TOOL
TO MAKE THE MOST
OF A TRENDY FRUIT.
HI. I'M SHARON.
AND I'M KATE.
AND WE ARE FRILL.
AND WE ARE FRILL.
WE ARE ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
FRILL CLOTHING
DESIGNS AND PRODUCES
CUSTOM RECRUITMENT CLOTHING
FOR SORORITIES ACROSS
THE COUNTRY AND IN CANADA.
RECRUITMENT IS WHERE
POTENTIAL NEW MEMBERS
RUSH VARIOUS SORORITIES
ACROSS THEIR COLLEGE CAMPUS.
IT'S BEEN A LONGSTANDING
TRADITION
FOR SORORITIES TO DRESS
IN UNISON DURING RUSH WEEK.
AS A SORORITY GIRL MYSELF,
I WAS TIRED OF BUYING
EXPENSIVE AND UNFLATTERING
CLOTHING YEAR AFTER YEAR.
IN ADDITION,
MULTIPLE PROBLEMS
CAN ARISE
FROM THESE BULK ORDERS.
SORORITIES
GENERALLY DON'T KNOW
IF THE VENDOR HAS ENOUGH
IN STOCK FOR THE ENTIRE CHAPTER.
THE GIRLS TYPICALLY DON'T
GET TO TRY ON THE PIECES
BEFORE ORDERING,
THUS CAUSING FIT ISSUES,
AND WORST OF ALL, THEY DON'T
KNOW IF ANOTHER SORORITY
AT THEIR SCHOOL IS GONNA BE
WEARING THE EXACT SAME OUTFITS.
OH, NO.
THE HORROR!
FRILL SOLVES
ALL THESE PROBLEMS.
WE COME TO EACH CHAPTER
INDIVIDUALLY, HOST FITTINGS,
AND PRODUCE PIECES
FOR EACH SORORITY.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, SHARKS?
WILL YOU RUSH FRILL?
O'Leary:
I JUST WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT.
YOU GO TO EVERY SORORITY
IN THE NATION, THEORETICALLY.
THANK YOU.
AND SAY, "LISTEN,
WE'RE GONNA DESIGN
"A UNIQUE OUTFIT FOR JUST YOU
THAT SHOWS YOUR ALLEGIANCE."
IS THAT TRUE?
IS IT UNIQUE TO EVERY SORORITY?
Steadman: IT IS UNIQUE
TO THAT CHAPTER AT THAT SCHOOL,
BUT WE DO HAVE
THE SAME PIECES
AT DIFFERENT CHAPTERS
ACROSS THE U.S.
HOW MANY ARE THERE
IN THE UNITED STATES?
THERE ARE 3,127 SORORITY ACROSS
THE COUNTRY AND IN CANADA.
WHAT WOULD YOU CHARGE
FOR THAT PARTICULAR DRESS
FOR A SORORITY MEMBER?
THIS DRESS WOULD GO FOR
BETWEEN $100 AND $120.
CUSTOM-MADE?
WELL, EACH OF OUR PIECES
IS CUSTOM-MADE,
SO IT WOULD COST
ABOUT $120,
BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER
OF GIRLS IN EACH SORORITY.
IS THE IDEA TO GET EVERY GIRL
TO BUY THE SAME DRESS
SO WHEN THEY GO TO A FUNCTION,
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME?
START FROM SCRATCH.
START FROM SCRATCH.
CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN
HOW RUSH WORKS?
YES. THESE SORORITIES
HAVE DIFFERENT THEME DAYS.
AS THE DAYS GO ON,
THE OUTFITS GET MORE FORMAL.
SO, THE FIRST DAY,
THEY'RE WEARING A T-SHIRT,
BUT BY THE END OF THE WEEK,
THEY'RE WEARING A FORMAL DRESS
LIKE THIS.
IS THE POINT
THAT YOU FEEL LIKE A TEAM?
YOU ALL LOOK ALIKE.
YES.
YOU TAKE PICTURES.
MM-HMM.
EXACTLY.
SO, WHAT DOES
A SKIRT LIKE THIS --
WHAT DO YOU MAKE IT FOR,
AND THEN WHAT DOES IT COST?
THAT SKIRT
COSTS $24 TO PRODUCE,
AND IT SELLS FOR
BETWEEN $60 AND $70.
AND DO YOU MAKE THEM
IN AMERICA?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
FROM LAUNCH, WE'VE DONE
JUST OVER $400,000 IN SALES.
WOW.
GOOD FOR YOU.
BUT TWO OF THOSE YEARS, WE WERE
FULL-TIME COLLEGE STUDENTS.
OUR FIRST YEAR IN BUSINESS
AS JUNIORS IN COLLEGE,
WE DID $37,000 IN SALES
AND STARTED THE COMPANY
WITH ONLY $500.
WOW.
LAST YEAR,
AS SENIORS IN COLLEGE,
WE DID $149,000 IN SALES.
WHAT IS THE LEAD TIME
TO ORDER?
WE TAKE ORDERS
FROM FEBRUARY TO MAY.
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR SALES
COME IN THAT SHORT PERIOD
OF TIME?
ABOUT 70%.
WHOA.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE
A BRIDAL DIVISION.
WE STARTED OUR BRIDAL DIVISION
IN JANUARY OF 2013
WHEN OUR PICTURE WENT VIRAL
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
WITHIN A MONTH,
WE LITERALLY HAD HUNDREDS
OF BRIDAL PARTIES
CONTACTING US,
BEGGING TO MAKE THESE OUTFITS
FOR THEIR BRIDESMAIDS.
SO, A TYPICAL GIRL
IN A RUSH WEEK
WOULD BUY SEVEN DRESSES
OR SEVEN OUTFITS FROM YOU?
THEY SPEND
ABOUT $500 FOR RUSH.
YOU'RE KILLING IT, YEAH.
THESE GIRLS WILL BY FROM US
FOUR YEARS IN A ROW,
AND THEN
ONCE THEY GRADUATE,
THEY'LL COME BACK TO US
FOR THEIR BRIDESMAID OUTFITS.
TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR COMPETITION.
WE HAVE ONE
DIRECT COMPETITOR,
AND THEN WE HAVE
BIG-BOX COMPETITORS
JUST LIKE J.CREW
AND LILLY PULITZER.
Cuban:
AND YOU DESIGN THEM CUSTOM.
SO YOU GET TO SAY,
"THIS IS YOURS,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO
THAT HAS THE SAME THING
FROM J.CREW."
EXACTLY.
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY FOR?
TO RAMP UP PRODUCTION
SO THAT WE CAN
INCREASE OUR MARGINS
BY PAYING LESS PER PIECE.
Cuban: GUYS, LET ME
GET THINGS ROLLING HERE.
OF EVERYBODY HERE,
I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS EXPERIENCE
SELLING TO SORORITIES.
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,
I USED TO GO SORORITY HOUSE
TO SORORITY HOUSE
AND OFFER MY SERVICES
TO TEACH DANCE...
[ LAUGHTER ]
...LINE DANCES
AND DIFFERENT DANCES.
Greiner: SERIOUSLY?
COME ON.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I USED TO MAKE $25 AN HOUR.
I MADE A KILLING.
IT WAS THE BEST THING EVER.
WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.
AND YOU'RE SMART. YOU'RE DOING
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.
BUT DESPITE
MY MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
I DON'T THINK
I'M THE BEST FIT FOR YOU.
AND SO I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN OFFER.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
YOUR $100,000,
BUT FOR A THIRD
OF THE BUSINESS.
OKAY.
SO, VALUING YOUR BUSINESS,
YOU CAME IN FOR $500,000.
SHE'S OFFERING YOU
A $300,000 VALUATION.
DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE AN OFFER?
LOOK, I LIKE IT.
I LIKE IT.
I'M GONNA MAKE THE SAME OFFER.
Corcoran: YOU CAN'T EVEN
ENTERTAIN THAT FOR A MOMENT,
BECAUSE HE'D
SCARE EVERYBODY AWAY.
Herjavec: NO, HE'S GREAT.
NO ONE WANTS HIM
IN YOUR BUSINESS.
KATE --
I MADE YOU A VALID OFFER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
MY BIGGEST FAN BASE
IS OUT THERE IN THE SORORITIES.
KATE?
THEY LOVE MR. WONDERFUL.
Herjavec: KATE?
YES?
OKAY.
Greiner:
YOU'RE THEIR FAVORITE.
I LOVE IT.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT
BIG FISH, LITTLE POND.
I LOVE THIS MARKET,
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN CAPTURE IT,
YOU'RE GONNA DOMINATE
A NICHE MARKET.
I LOVE IT.
MORE THAN THAT...
LOVE YOU GUYS.
I MEAN, TO BE THIS YOUNG
AND THIS LEVEL-HEADED
AND HAVE SUCH
A GREAT STRATEGY --
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
I CAN HELP YOU
GROW THE BUSINESS.
I WILL GIVE YOU EXACTLY
WHAT YOU CAME IN ASKING FOR.
$100,000 FOR 20%.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
WAIT.
WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YES OR NO?
WHILE WE'RE SELLING --
YES OR NO?
WHILE WE'RE SELLING --
Narrator: KATE AND SHARON
HAVE THREE OFFERS
FOR THEIR CUSTOM
SORORITY RECRUITMENT
CLOTHING BUSINESS, FRILL.
BARBARA AND KEVIN HAVE BOTH
OFFERED $100,000 FOR 33%,
BUT ROBERT
HAS COMPLICATED MATTERS
BY OFFERING THEM
EXACTLY WHAT THEY ASKED FOR.
I WILL GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 20%.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
WAIT.
WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YES OR NO?
WHILE WE'RE SELLING --
YES OR NO?
WHILE WE'RE SELLING --
YES OR NO?
WAIT A SECOND.
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE
OR NOT?
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I'M NOT GONNA NEGOTIATE
WITH THE OTHER GUYS.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
YOU CAME IN
LOOKING FOR $100,000 FOR 20%.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO NEGOTIATE.
Greiner:
I'D MAKE YOU AN OFFER,
BUT I THINK ROBERT
WOULD HAVE A HEART ATTACK.
HE WANTS IT SO BADLY.
WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?
$100,000 FOR 20%.
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE
OR NOT?
IT'S WHAT
YOU WERE ASKING FOR.
Greiner: YOU GUYS?
Corcoran: KEVIN.
BARBARA MADE YOU AN OFFER --
$100,000 FOR 33%.
WE'RE GONNA MODIFY OUR OFFER.
WE'RE MODIFYING OUR OFFER.
WE'RE GOING IN TOGETHER.
KEVIN -- OH.
YOU'LL GET TWO SHARKS
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE <i>TWO</i> SHARKS,
THAT CHANGES THE WHOLE GAME.
Corcoran: LET ME MENTION
ONE OTHER THING.
THERE'S A BUSINESS
I INVESTED IN LAST SEASON
CALLED GRACE AND LACE
WHICH, BY FAR,
HAS BEEN
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
SELLING ANYTHING
IN THE DESIGN SPACE.
THEY WENT FROM LESS THAN
$1 MILLION IN SALES
TO $7 MILLION IN SALES.
I HELPED SOURCE THEIR SOCKS,
GOT THEM A CHEAPER PRICE.
I INTRODUCED THEM TO THE BIGGEST
SUPPLIER IN NEW YORK CITY.
I'VE ADVISED THEM ON WHAT
TO GO FOR, WHAT NOT TO GO FOR.
THEY'RE BRILLIANT PEOPLE.
THEY'RE BRILLIANT,
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS ARE.
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I WORK THAT BUSINESS,
AND THEY LEAN ON ME.
YOU AIN'T GONNA GET THAT
FROM ROBERT.
I LIKE TWO SHARKS
ON THIS ONE.
WELL, I THINK --
YOU NEED TO ACCELERATE, AND
YOU NEED TO GET EVERY CAMPUS.
THE OPPORTUNITY'S NOW.
WE'RE BOTH GONNA WORK VERY HARD
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
I'M GONNA BE FOCUSED.
AND I'LL KEEP HIM ON A LEASH.
SO, IT'S BARBARA AND KEVIN.
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK
OVER THERE.
FOR $100,000 AT 33%.
AND THEN YOU HAVE ROBERT --
$100,000 AT 20%, WHICH IS JUST
WHAT YOU CAME IN ASKING FOR.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
[ WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ]
WOULD YOU GUYS BE WILLING
TO TAKE IT DOWN TO 30%?
YEAH.
YES.
THEN WE WANT YOU
TO JOIN FRILL.
YO!
O'Leary:
I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL!
WELCOME TO THE SORORITY.
THANK YOU.
NICELY DONE.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
I THINK I'M IN SHOCK.
AND WE STARTED
WITH NOTHING.
THIS IS THE AMERICAN DREAM
RIGHT HERE.
Narrator:
IN SEASON FIVE,
DAYMOND JOHN OFFERED
TO MENTOR MOZIAH BRIDGES,
AN 11-YEAR-OLD FASHION DESIGNER
WITH A HANDMADE BOW TIE
BUSINESS.
IN 1989, I WAS OFFERED $10,000
FOR 40% OF MY COMPANY.
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T
TAKE THAT MONEY.
I STRONGLY SUGGEST
YOU DON'T TAKE ON INVESTORS
AT THIS TIME.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
Moziah: I DIDN'T GET A DEAL
ON "SHARK TANK,"
BUT I GOT SOMETHING MUCH BETTER.
TRAMICA, MO.
HOW YOU DOING?
BRING IT IN FOR A FAMILY HUG.
A MENTORSHIP WITH
MY FASHION IDOL, DAYMOND JOHN.
THIS FACTORY'S GONNA HELP GET
MO'S BOWS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
WE ONLY HAD $55,000 IN SALES.
NOW, SEVEN MONTHS
AFTER "SHARK TANK,"
WE'VE REACHED
ALMOST $200,000 IN SALES.
WE NEED A MANUFACTURER
MORE THAN EVER,
AND WE KNEW
DAYMOND COULD HELP US OUT.
THIS IS ROBERT
FROM ROBERT STEWART.
HEY, MO.
HOW ARE YOU?
I FOUND MO
THE PERFECT MANUFACTURER --
ROBERT STEWART,
A MANUFACTURER
THAT'S BEEN HAND-MAKING TIES
FOR 100 YEARS.
THIS IS GOOD, OLD
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING.
GOOD, OLD MADE IN THE U.S.A.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Moziah: BEING MADE BY HAND
AND BEING MADE IN AMERICA
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
THAT YOU STAND BEHIND YOUR TIE,
AND IT HELPS KEEP JOBS
IN THE ECONOMY.
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO AT HOME.
NOW YOU CAN DO IT IN A FACTORY.
John:
WE HAD TO FIND A MANUFACTURER
THAT COULD MEET THE DEMAND
AND STAY TRUE TO MO'S MISSION.
IT'S A PERFECT MATCH.
THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING. THANK YOU
FOR SHOWING US THE FACTORY.
PLEASURE.
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS
THAT HAPPENED TO MO'S BOWS
IS THE C.E.O. OF NEIMAN MARCUS
PERSONALLY REACHED OUT TO US.
SHE WANTED TO DO A TEST
OF MO'S BOWS IN NEIMAN MARCUS.
[ CHUCKLES ]
NEIMAN MARCUS
IS THE GOLD STANDARD
OF LUXURY RETAIL STORES.
DESIGNERS SPEND ALL THEIR LIVES
ATTEMPTING TO GET HERE,
AND MO HAS DONE IT
AT 13 YEARS OLD.
YOU DO WELL,
YOU COULD BE
IN EVERY NEIMAN MARCUS
IN THE WORLD.
Moziah: SEEING MY BOW TIES
IN NEIMAN MARCUS
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
I ARRIVED.
SINCE COMING ON
"SHARK TANK,"
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED
IN MY LIFE.
NOW IT'S MY TURN.
LET'S DO SOME SHOPPING.
John: I MADE SOME AMAZING DEALS
ON "SHARK TANK,"
BUT THIS MENTORSHIP
IS SPECIAL TO ME.
I WAS MENTORED BY GREAT PEOPLE.
I'M TRYING TO PAY IT FORWARD,
AND HE'S MAKING ME PROUD
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
IS ALL THE JOY
OF BUILDING A BUSINESS
IS TO DREAM
AND SEE HOW FAR YOU COULD GO.
Herjavec:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE
MOST OF THE UNIVERSE?
BARBARA, YOU'RE VERY CONFUSED,
BECAUSE
YOU KEEP FORGETTING RETAIL'S AT
HALF THE MARGIN,
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL
TIED UP IN RETAIL.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S KEY IN RETAIL?
NO. YOU KNOW --
YOU'RE TYING UP CAPITAL
IN RETAIL.
HEY.
I CAN PROVIDE THAT FUNDING.
BUT YOU TOOK A SHOT
AT MY DEAL,
AND YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE
FOR THAT.
YOUR DEAL IS ROBBERY.
SO, LOOK,
AS A MATTER OF FACT --
HE'S SUCH A SHORT MAN.
THEY ALWAYS ARE PUSHY.
...HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE TWO SHARKS
INSTEAD OF
ONE NOISY ONE?
I'M GONNA PROPOSE
TO ROBERT RIGHT NOW
THAT HE COMES INTO MY DEAL
UNDER THE SAME TERMS
THAT I ORIGINALLY PROPOSED SO
I'M NOT COMPETING WITH MYSELF.
NOW YOU HAVE <i>TWO</i> SHARKS.
KEVIN, I LIKE THE OFFER,
OBVIOUSLY.
IT'S RICHER THAN MINE,
SO WHY <i>WOULDN'T</i> I LIKE IT?
BUT CALL A SPADE A SPADE.
IT'S NOT AS GOOD
AS LORI'S OFFER.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
UP THE MONEY.
LORI'S A SINGLE SHARKETTE.
BESIDES,
HE TOTALLY DOESN'T SEE
WE'RE TWO SHARKS.
THAT A MAN WITH MONEY IS NO
MATCH FOR A WOMAN ON A MISSION.
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING,
KEVIN,
IS WE GO WITH TERMS
OF YOUR OFFER.
YES.
WE SIMPLY BUMP THE MONEY
TO $75,000 EACH.
DONE.
KEVIN AND I ARE GONNA OFFER
$150,000 IN TOTAL,
$10 OFF EVERY PILLOW.
ONCE WE'RE PAID BACK
TIMES THREE,
IT CONVERTS
TO 2.5% EQUITY.
