HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS GEORGE CONWAY,
AND I'M FROM CHATTANOOGA,
TENNESSEE.
MY COMPANY'S CALLED BedRyder.
I'M SEEKING $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF MY COMPANY.
SHARKS, RIDING IN THE BACK
OF A PICKUP TRUCK --
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE PROBLEM IS,
IT'S JUST NOT SAFE UNTIL NOW.
I love that accent.
NOW, KEEP IN MIND,
I'M 53 YEARS OLD,
AND THIS IS NOT THAT BAD.
WOW.
JUST SLIDE THE SYSTEM
IN THE VERY BACK.
POPS IN.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
IN THERE ALREADY
THAT YOU'RE
ATTACHING IT TO?
THERE'S THREE BOLTS
THAT ARE UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK.
YOU HAVE TO DRILL SOME HOLES,
AND BOLTS ARE PUT IN.
SO, YOU HAVE TO DRILL --
IN ORDER TO INSTALL THESE,
YOU HAVE TO DRILL THESE HOLES?
YES, SIR.
THE BedRyder SYSTEM ADDS THE
CONVENIENT SEATING OF AN S.U.V.
TO THE ROLE
OF A PICKUP TRUCK,
CREATING WHAT WE IN THE SOUTH
LIKE TO CALL A TRUCK-U.V.
HOW COOL IS THAT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S COOL.
YEE-HAW!
THAT'S COOL, ISN'T IT?
A TRUCK-U.V.
THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU TAKE AN S.U.V. RIGHT HERE,
AND THIS IS THE TRUCK.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY'RE
COMING TO AN INTERSECTION.
THEY CRASH.
THIS IS WHAT YOU GOT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS IT!
HAVE YOU TESTED?
HAVE YOU DONE CRASH TESTING?
I -- YOU WANT --
HONESTLY, YES.
I HAVE DONE MY OWN
BY ACCIDENT. I WAS --
BY ACCIDENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE WERE AT -- WE WENT TO
A NASCAR RACE DOWN IN ATLANTA.
WHO'S "WE," GEORGE?
MY BEST FRIEND, KERRY.
MM-HMM.
THE ACTUAL INVENTOR.
AND HIS TWO SONS.
Herjavec: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE NOT THE INVENTOR?
I AM HIS BEST FRIEND.
I AM THE SALES MANAGER.
Greiner: WAIT A MINUTE. I JUST
WANT TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED --
ON THE ACCIDENT.
THE CAR GOT DESTROYED
PRETTY GOOD.
EVERYBODY WAS FINE
IN THE TRUCK.
GEORGE, I SEE THE SKIES
RAINING DOWN WITH LITIGATION.
THE FLAW IS,
EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S ILLEGAL
TO RIDE IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP.
I THOUGHT IT WAS.
QUITE FRANKLY, IT IS.
HOWEVER --
[ LAUGHTER ]
HOWEVER, IT IS ILLEGAL TO RIDE
IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK
UNRESTRAINED.
WE'VE HAD IT
INDEPENDENTLY TESTED,
AND IT MEETS AND EXCEEDS
ALL FEDERAL GUIDELINES.
YOU ARE COMPLETELY LEGAL.
EVERY STATE?
EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY.
Cuban: WELL, LET'S ASK
THE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS.
SO, HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
HOW MANY STATES
HAVE YOU SOLD THEM IN?
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THEM?
I'VE SOLD 800 UNITS SO FAR
ON THE INTERNET.
Corcoran: OVER WHAT PERIOD
OF TIME WERE THOSE SALES?
FOUR YEARS.
Herjavec:
WOW, THAT'S LOW.
WHERE IS THE INVENTOR?
WHY ISN'T HE HERE?
THE INVENTOR, KERRY HIDE,
HAS BEEN MY BEST FRIEND
SINCE WE WERE 7 YEARS OLD.
KERRY HANDLES
ALL OF THE OPERATIONS.
HE GETS THE CHAIRS ASSEMBLED,
GETS THEM BROUGHT
TO OUR PLACE IN ATLANTA.
THEN I'M THE PERSON
IN CHARGE OF ALL THE SALES.
OKAY, SO KERRY
STARTED THE COMPANY
AND OWNS WHAT PERCENTAGE?
HE OWNS 85% OF THE COMPANY.
Corcoran: OHH.
BUT DO YOU HAVE
THE OTHER 15%?
DID YOU GET THE 15%?
YES, I HAVE THE 15%.
YES.
THE TRUTH IS THIS BUSINESS
REALLY CAN'T SUPPORT BOTH OF YOU
OR EITHER ONE OF YOU.
NOW, THERE'S A HUGE INDUSTRY
SELLING AFTERMARKET PRODUCTS
TO GUYS WHO HAVE PICKUP TRUCKS
ALL OVER AMERICA.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THESE
AVAILABLE THERE?
SINCE I'VE COME ABOARD
SIX MONTHS AGO,
I HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED
WITH AN ONLINE COMPANY
THAT THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST THING
IS TRUCK ACCESSORIES.
IN FACT, WE JUST SIGNED A DEAL
WITH THEM.
SO, GEORGE, IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA GROW THE BUSINESS?
IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA SCALE?
I HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT OTHER WAYS
THAT I AM GOING TO GROW
THIS COMPANY.
THE FIRST
IS I HAVE 800 PEOPLE
WHO INVESTED IN MY COMPANY
AND BOUGHT MY UNITS FROM ME.
SO, BASICALLY,
I'M CALLING ALL THESE CUSTOMERS,
AND I'M OFFERING THEM INCENTIVE
TO BECOME MY SALES REPS.
THEY'RE GONNA GET $100
FOR EVERY SALE THAT THEY MAKE.
I <i>LOVE</i>
THE WAY YOU SELL, GEORGE.
YOU ARE A GOOD SALESPERSON.
Corcoran: VERY GOOD.
Herjavec:
WHERE ARE YOU MAKING THESE?
EVERYTHING IS MADE IN AMERICA.
THE FRAME IS WHAT
WE MANUFACTURE.
WE GET THE SEATS AND THE COVERS
FROM ATLANTA.
WE GET THE HARNESSES SENT IN
FROM MICHIGAN.
GEORGE, WHAT'S IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?
$300.
I SELL THEM FOR $699 A SET.
GEORGE, IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE, MY FRIEND.
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MANUFACTURING
THIS FOR, LIKE, 100 BUCKS
TO PUT IT INTO WHOLESALE
AT $300
IN ORDER TO SELL IT AT RETAIL
AT $500 TO $600.
EXACTLY.
SO, HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?
HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT?
I HAVE THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION, BY THE WAY.
HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH.
I WILL BUY 1,000 UNITS.
IF I GET $200,000,
I WILL SPEND IT AND BUY 1,000
UNITS, AND I WILL RE-NEGOTIATE,
AND I WILL BRING MY PRICE
DOWN TO $200 A UNIT.
YOU KNOW, I WORRY ABOUT CRASHES,
AND I WORRY ABOUT ROLL-OVERS.
FOR ME,
I CAN'T GET PAST THAT.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN,
SO IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT
TO COME ON BACK IN, I'M HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GEORGE, I WANT TO HIRE <i>YOU.</i>
I LOVE YOU, GEORGE.
FORGET THE BUSINESS.
I JUST WANT TO HIRE YOU.
O'Leary: JUST LOVE
LISTENING TO YOU. YOU'RE GREAT,
BUT I WANT YOU,
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK,
TO TAKE THAT TRUCK
AND DRIVE IT OFF A CLIFF.
MR. WONDERFUL,
I REALLY LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.
I LIKE YOU, TOO.
BUT DOOR'S ONLY OPEN
FOR SO LONG, SIR.
I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
O'Leary:
OKAY, LOOK, GEORGE.
I'D LIKE YOU
TO GET RID OF THIS THING
SO YOU CAN GO SELL SOMETHING
WHERE YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
I REALLY WOULD.
HOWEVER, ON THIS
PARTICULAR IDEA, I'M OUT.
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
GUYS, LET ME STEP IN.
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
LOVE YOU.
LOOK, YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYBODY
IT'S A HUGELY
CASH-INTENSIVE BUSINESS.
ABSOLUTELY.
CASH-INTENSIVE
DOESN'T BOTHER ME
WHEN YOU'RE TURNING INVENTORY
A LOT AND IT'S VERY PREDICTABLE.
RIGHT.
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHEN THE NEXT ORDER IS COMING
OR AT WHAT FLOW
THEY'RE GONNA COME.
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO ALWAYS HAVE
TOO MUCH MONEY
SUNK INTO INVENTORY,
WHICH MAKES IT
FAR MORE DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO GET A RETURN
ON MY INVESTMENT,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.
Herjavec: GEORGE, I THINK
YOU DID A GOOD JOB TODAY.
GREAT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT.
I JUST DON'T SEE IT
REPLACING S.U.V.s.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
Corcoran: FOR ME...
I THINK THIS IS
A PHENOMENAL IDEA.
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
SAYS FUN, FUN, FUN,
AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT,
I ASSOCIATE WITH HAPPY MEMORIES.
MY DAD USED TO LET
3 OF HIS 10 KIDS
HANG OFF THE BACK OF HIS STATION
WAGON EVERYWHERE WE WENT.
THAT'S WHY
THERE'S ONLY THREE LEFT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET ME MENTION
ONE OTHER THING.
YOU'RE A 15% PARTNER.
WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING
TO THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER,
THE GUY
WHO RUNS THE BUSINESS.
WE HAVE -- WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS
IN GREAT DETAIL.
I HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO MAKE
WHATEVER DECISION IS MADE.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION?
WHO'S KERRY?
I DON'T KNOW
WHO I'M BUYING INTO, SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
LOOK, YOU GOT TO TELL KERRY
HE REALLY SCREWED UP.
MM.
WELL --
NO, <i>YOU</i> SCREWED UP.
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE SALESMAN,
AND YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.
YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT
OF THAT OBJECTION.
SO OBVIOUS.
YES.
O'Leary: I THINK
IT'S AN IMPORTANT LESSON.
AND, GEORGE,
MY OFFER STANDS.
YOU, ME,
CAN OF GAS, A MATCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN'T DO THAT, BOSS.
THANK Y'ALL.
Herjavec: TAKE CARE.
I WISH I'D HAD KERRY
OUT THERE WITH ME.
I THINK IF KERRY CAME OUT THERE,
WE WOULD'VE NAILED IT.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A BUSINESS
POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE LUCRATIVE
SORORITY MARKET.
? DO, DO, DO-WOP-WOP ?
? DO, DO, DO-WOP-WOP ?
? DO, DO, DO-WOP ?
? WE HOPE
THE SHARKS PICK FRILL ?
[ LAUGHS ]
I LIKE IT. I'M IN.
