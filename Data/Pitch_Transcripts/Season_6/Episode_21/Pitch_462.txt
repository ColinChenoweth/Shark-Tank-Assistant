MY NAME'S
MICHELLE BARSOSKY,
AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND,
JASON BARSOSKY.
AND WE LIVE IN AMHERST,
NEW HAMPSHIRE,
WITH OUR 5-YEAR-OLD TWINS
ABBY AND EMMA.
AFTER WE WERE MARRIED,
JASON AND I DECIDED
THAT WE WERE GONNA
START A FAMILY.
WE HAD TROUBLE
CONCEIVING.
WE ENDED UP GOING TO
FERTILITY TREATMENTS.
AND OUR TWINS WERE BORN, AND
THEY'RE THE LIGHT OF OUR LIVES.
I THINK MY LIGHT-BULB MOMENT
WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
TRYING TO FEED TWO BABIES
AT ONE TIME.
I WAS HAVING A REAL HARD TIME
GETTING THE BABIES POSITIONED,
AND I JUST COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING THAT WAS WORKING.
AND SO I THINK
IT'S JUST OUT OF NECESSITY
THAT YOU END UP
COMING UP WITH SOMETHING.
WHEN THE GIRLS WERE YOUNG,
JASON AND I GOT A PHONE CALL
THAT THEY WERE HAVING LAYOFFS
AT OUR COMPANY.
WE LOST EVERYTHING.
IT WAS SCARY.
IT WAS VERY SCARY,
AND WE NEEDED MONEY.
AND THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED
TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.
DO YOU LIKE THE LIGHT PINK,
OR DO YOU LIKE THE DARKER PINK?
THERE'S SO MANY
MOMS OF TWINS.
IT'S REALLY A GROWING POPULATION
OF BABIES.
Jason:
WE'VE REACHED A POINT
WHERE WE NEED SOME GUIDANCE
AND SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
TO REALLY GET THIS THING
TO TAKE OFF.
WE KNOW WE HAVE A PERFECT
PRODUCT FOR A GROWING MARKET,
AND WE CAN BRING
A LITTLE COMFORT
TO FAMILIES
OF TWINS EVERYWHERE.
HI, MY NAME'S MICHELLE.
AND I'M HER HUSBAND,
JASON.
OUR COMPANY
IS THE TWIN Z PILLOW.
WE ARE SEEKING $75,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR A 10% SHARE IN OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, DID YOU KNOW
THAT IT CAN TAKE
A MOM OF MULTIPLES OVER 12 HOURS
A DAY TO FEED HER BABIES?
ONE INFANT FEEDS
30 TO 45 MINUTES AT TIME
12 TIMES A DAY,
AND THAT'S DOUBLE FOR TWINS.
WHEN I HAD MY TWINS,
I SEARCHED AND SEARCHED
FOR SOMETHING
TO HELP ME FEED THE BABIES,
BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING
THAT WAS COMFORTABLE
OR FIT MY BODY.
SO, I TOOK MY MOM'S
30-YEAR-OLD SEWING MACHINE
AND CAME UP
WITH THE FIRST TWIN Z PILLOW.
THIS IS HOW
THE TWIN Z PILLOW WORKS.
SHARKS, A TWIN Z PILLOW
IS THE FIRST PILLOW
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY
FOR MOMS OF MULTIPLES.
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE,
MOM CAN BOTTLE-FEED
OR BREAST-FEED TWO BABIES
AT ONE TIME, CUTTING THOSE
FEEDING TIMES IN HALF,
LEAVING MOM AN EXTRA SIX HOURS
IN HER DAY.
AND THE TWIN Z PILLOW HAS A VERY
UNIQUE BACK SUPPORT SYSTEM
UNLIKE ANY OTHER PILLOW
ON THE MARKET.
NO MORE HUNCHING OVER
WITH NECK AND BACK PAIN FOR MOM.
SO, SHARKS,
WE'LL HELP YOU
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY
IF YOU JOIN OUR...
DOUBLE TROUBLE TWIN-TASTIC
TWIN Z PILLOW TEAM.
MICHELLE, WHY WOULDN'T
TWO PILLOWS WORK HERE?
WELL, BETWEEN PROPPING UP
WITH YOUR BACK,
AND PROPPING UP ON THE SIDES,
AND THE BABIES ROLL OFF,
THERE'S A LOT OF LOGISTICS
THAT GO INTO HAVING TWO INFANTS.
AND ALSO,
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS PILLOW
IS PREGNANT MOMS, BEFORE
THEY'VE EVEN HAD THE BABIES,
THEY SIT IN IT LIKE A CHAIR,
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF
BACK PAIN WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT.
O'Leary: MY GREAT CONCERN
ABOUT THIS CONCEPT
IS WE HAVE TO FIND
PARENTS WITH TWINS,
WHICH IS SOME SUBSET
OF A SUBSET
OF THE POPULATION
THAT HAPPEN TO BE HAVING BABIES.
IN THE UNITED STATES,
THERE'S 135,000 TWINS
BORN EVERY YEAR.
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD, MICHELLE?
THIS YEAR, WE'RE ON TRACK
TO DO $510,000.
$510,000.
REALLY?
YEP.
YEAR-TO-DATE,
WE'RE AT $300,000.
AND HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?
2 1/2 YEARS.
Herjavec: WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?
$99.99.
WHOA.
Greiner: HOW MUCH DOES IT
COST YOU TO MAKE ONE?
$29.
Herjavec: WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL SELL NEXT YEAR?
$1.2 MILLION
TO $1.5 MILLION.
WOW, YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT.
WHAT DO YOU BASE THAT ON?
BASED ON OUR SALES,
WE DOUBLE EVERY NINE MONTHS.
ALL RIGHT, SO
HOW'D YOU COME UP WITH THIS?
MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH GOT
LAID OFF AT OUR CORPORATE JOBS,
AND --
WHAT DID YOU USED TO DO?
WE WERE BOTH
IN PHARMACEUTICAL SALES.
YEAH.
SO, WHEN WE LOST OUR JOBS,
WE HAD NO CARS. WE HAD
NO PHONES. WE HAD NOTHING.
SO I WENT TO WASHING CARS
FOR A FRIEND OF MINE
WHILE I WAS
LOOKING FOR WORK.
AND ALL HER FRIENDS
KEPT COMING OVER AND SAYING,
"YOU SHOULD REALLY
PATENT THAT PILLOW."
AND SHE GOES,
"THIS IS A GREAT TIME.
I'M GONNA STAY HOME
WITH THE GIRLS."
GOOD FOR YOU, BECAUSE THERE'S
GONNA BE PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME
THAT ARE IN SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES,
THINKING, "IF I ONLY
KNEW SOMEBODY, IF I ONLY
HAD CAPITAL AVAILABLE."
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY.
YOU PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE,
AND YOU WENT FOR IT.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY WE DO THIS SHOW.
DID YOU SAY
WHERE YOU'RE MANUFACTURING?
Michelle:
WE MANUFACTURE IN THE U.S.
THE PILLOWS
ARE MADE IN GEORGIA.
THE COVERS ARE MADE
IN MASSACHUSETTS RIGHT NOW.
SO, HOW MANY PROTOTYPES
DID YOU GO THROUGH?
AND TELL ME
ABOUT THE PROCESS.
I TOOK MY MOM'S
SEWING MACHINE.
DID YOUR MOM
HELP YOU SEW THEM?
NO, UNFORTUNATELY,
MY MOM,
SHE HAD PASSED AWAY
BY THE TIME --
I'M SORRY.
RIGHT BEFORE
THE GIRLS WERE BORN,
WE HAD GONE THROUGH A LOT
OF IVF TREATMENTS, AND WE HAD --
WE HAD A LOT OF LOSSES.
WE HAD A LOT OF LOSSES.
AND I JUST SAID,
"I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE."
IT WAS LITERALLY
THE LOWEST TIME IN MY LIFE.
COME TO FIND OUT THAT MY MOM,
AFTER HAVING M.S. FOR 35 YEARS,
WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH PANCREATIC CANCER.
I'M SORRY.
SO, WE SAID, YOU KNOW,
IF WE HAVE ONE CHANCE
OF HER MEETING HER GRANDCHILD,
WE'D TRY IT ONE MORE TIME.
AND, SO, WE DID, AND --
WE GOT PREGNANT
WITH ABBY AND EMMA.
YEAH.
NOW THEY'RE 5.
SHE MADE IT TO SEE THEM.
SHE LIVED A GREAT,
WONDERFUL FOUR MONTHS,
AND I KEPT
HER SEWING MACHINE.
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING
ENTREPRENEURS.
THANK YOU.
YOU GUYS ARE
THE AMERICAN DREAM
AND DESERVE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE EARNED.
THANK YOU.
BUT IT'S JUST NOT A FIT
FOR WHAT I DO,
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, MARK.
THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS.
OH, NO.
YOU EARNED IT.
THANK YOU.
JASON, I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY.
SO, BIG-BOX RETAILER CALLED US
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.
buybuy BABY.
buybuy BABY.
THEY SAID THEY'D LIKE
TO START IT OUT ONLINE,
BUT PROBABLY
BRING IT INTO THE STORE.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
WHEN YOU HAVE
A VERY NICHE-ORIENTED PRODUCT
LIKE THIS...
YEAH.
...GOING INTO GENERAL RETAIL
ISN'T ALWAYS --
RIGHT. RIGHT.
...I MEAN, I HATE
TO SAY NO TO ORDERS...
NO, WE AGREE.
...BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IF I'M MAKING GOOD MONEY, $26,
SELLING IT FOR $99 --
THAT WAS OUR THOUGHT.
...AND YOUR CUSTOMERS
ARE FINDING YOU,
I DON'T KNOW IF GOING TO RETAIL
IS THE RIGHT APPROACH.
I DON'T KNOW
IF I AGREE WITH THAT.
I COULD EASILY SEE THIS
IN A MASS MARKET LIKE WALMART.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
EASILY. WHY NOT?
I AGREE WITH BARB. I THINK YOU
SHOULD BE EVERYWHERE YOU CAN BE.
NO, I THINK
YOU'RE WRONG.
I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE.
I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU WOULD HOLD IT BACK.
YOU CAN SELL IT
ON YOUR WEBSITE,
BUT YOU CAN ALSO
BE IN RETAILERS.
YOU'RE GONNA DOUBLE OR TRIPLE
YOUR MONEY.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LOOK.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN OFFER.
BUT 10% DOES NOT GET ME EXCITED
ABOUT EQUITY AT ALL.
SO, THE WAY I LOOK AT IT
IS I'LL GIVE YOU $75,000.
I WANT A $10 ROYALTY
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK $225,000.
SO, THREE TIMES ON MY MONEY,
THEN MY ROYALTY GOES AWAY.
AND TO INITIATE
THIS RELATIONSHIP,
I WANT 2.5% EQUITY.
THAT'S CALLED
A PACT WITH THE DEVIL.
Jason:
$10 OFF OF EACH SALE?
YES.
WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER YOU GET YOUR $225,000?
IT'S GONE. YOU DON'T PAY ME
ANYTHING ANYMORE.
THEN HE EATS YOUR CHILDREN.
Herjavec:
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE.
I'M GONNA MAKE
A ROYALTY OFFER.
AFTER SIX SEASONS, I'VE LEARNED
HOW THEY WORK FROM KEVIN.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $75,000.
I WANT THE SAME $10 PER UNIT,
BUT I ONLY WANT TO GET PAID BACK
TWICE THE AMOUNT
AS OPPOSED TO
KEVIN'S THREE TIMES.
SO, AT $150,000,
AND THE SAME 2.5% FOR EQUITY.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
IT'S SIMILAR TO KEVIN'S,
BUT OBVIOUSLY MUCH BETTER.
RIGHT.
NO OFFER FROM THE LADIES,
AND MARK'S OUT.
WELL, I THINK
YOU SHOULD PUT THEIR DEALS
IN YOUR MENTAL SHREDDER.
[ IMITATES SHREDDER ]
GONE.
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT ONE.
SO, HERE'S MY OFFER.
Narrator:
ONE SHARK IS OUT.
MICHELLE AND JASON
HAVE TWO OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR BREAST-FEEDING PILLOW
FOR TWINS, TWIN Z.
BUT LORI ALSO SEEMS INTERESTED.
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER YOU
$150,000.
I'M GOING TO, INTERESTINGLY,
ALSO WANT A ROYALTY.
WHOA!
$5 ROYALTY PER.
KEVIN'S GETTING
CONTAGIOUS HERE.
YES, SIR.
YES, HE'S RUBBING OFF.
Greiner:
ONCE I'M PAID BACK THE $150,000,
THEN I'LL TAKE
A 5% EQUITY STAKE,
'CAUSE I WANT TO HAVE
SKIN IN THE GAME.
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH buybuy BABY,
AND I THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD BE EVERYWHERE.
WHY NOT?
Corcoran:
I RESPECT LORI'S OFFER,
BUT I'D LIKE TO COMPETE
WITH THE OFFER.
Michelle: OKAY.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $75,000,
BUT I MUST ASK
FOR 20% OF THE BUSINESS.
BUT I'D LIKE
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY.
WHEN I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN A 10% OWNERSHIP
WITH ANY OF THE BUSINESSES,
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
MY ENTREPRENEURS,
AFTER A WHILE, THAT 10%
LOOKS SMALLER AND SMALLER
AS I'M WORKING MY BUNS OFF
TO PUSH THAT BUSINESS AHEAD.
SO, NOW I'D LIKE
TO PLAN FOR THE LONG HAUL.
TO LORI'S POINT
ABOUT GETTING IN RETAIL,
I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE GUYS' PRESENTATION
ABOUT JUST KEEPING IT ONLINE
MICHELLE AND JASON,
CAN I SAY WHAT IS WRONG
WITH ALL OF THE DEALS
ON THE TABLE OTHER THAN MINE?
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SKIN
IN THE GAME.
AND YOU'RE THE PRINCIPALS
OF THE BUSINESS.
WHATEVER YOU DON'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH, FINE.
I ROLL OVER.
BUT WHAT I CAN GIVE TO YOU,
WHICH IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT,
IS A LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP.
WHICH IS WHAT
I WOULD GIVE YOU, TOO.
EXCUSE ME, I'M NOT FINISHED.
Cuban: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BEING
CAPITAL CONSTRAINED AT ALL,
ROYALTY DEALS
MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.
THEY COST YOU TOO MUCH.
SO, FROM YOUR POSITION --
I WANT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING.
Herjavec: HE'S ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
I PUT MY HEART AND SOUL
INTO ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS.
FROM YOUR POSITION, THOUGH,
GUYS, NEGOTIATE.
O'Leary: YOU CAN TALK
TO ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS, TOO.
YADA, YADA, YADA.
NO, MY HEART AND SOUL IS IN IT,
AND I'M A PART OF THE FAMILY.
WE'RE ONE BIG FAMILY.
I'M CHANGING MY DEAL BECAUSE
KEVIN'S JUST SO AGGRAVATING.
O'Leary:
LET'S HEAR IT.
YOU KNOW, BARB,
YOU WANT TO GO IN WITH ME?
SO, $75,000, 20%.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?
Herjavec: EACH?
I COULD BE WRONG HERE.
I'M GONNA GO IT ALONE.
Greiner:
OKAY. MY OFFER IS THIS.
$75,000, AND I'LL ASK
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE.
WAIT, THAT'S
THE SAME THING I OFFERED.
SO I HAVE MATCHED
BARBARA'S OFFER.
O'Leary:
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST RECAP.
BOTH BARBARA AND LORI
HAVE SUGGESTED $75,000 FOR 20%
AND A JOURNEY INTO THE DARK
RETAIL HELL THAT WE SPOKE OF.
THE OTHER, FROM ROBERT AND I --
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU $150,000
AGAINST A $10 ROYALTY
UNTIL WE GET BACK EACH $225,000,
WHICH IS THREE TIMES
ON OUR MONEY,
AND WE'RE ONLY TAKING
FROM THE BUSINESS 2.5% EQUITY,
WHICH I THINK IS VERY FAIR,
ACTUALLY.
YOU'VE HEARD THE MERITS
FROM BOTH SIDES.
NOW MAKE YOUR DECISION.
OKAY. SO...
WOULD YOU GUYS BE WILLING
TO GO $75,000 FOR 15%?
YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WANT US TOGETHER?
I THINK WE BOTH --
WE SEE THE VALUE IN,
OBVIOUSLY, BOTH OF YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SOMETHING ABOUT 7.5%
DOESN'T GET ME GOING
IN THE MORNING.
YEAH, IT'S HARD FOR US.
WE WORK HARD.
WE PUT OUR HEART AND SOULS --
WOULD EITHER OF YOU CONSIDER
DOING THAT ALONE?
WE'VE REALLY WORKED HARD.
WE HAVE NO DEBT ON THE BOOKS.
WHAT IF YOU GOT
BOTH OF US AT 20%?
[ WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY ]
WE DON'T WANT THAT?
YEAH, I'LL DO IT AT 15%.
YEAH?
ALL RIGHT.
WHOA.
OH!
WHOA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
O'Leary:
WHOA. MICHELLE, YOU SNAKE.
WOW.
VERY CLEVER, JASON.
WHAT IF ROBERT AND I
KNOCK DOWN --
INSTEAD OF MAKING
THREE TIMES ON OUR MONEY,
WE ONLY MADE TWO TIMES,
AND WE ONLY TOOK 2.5% EQUITY?
AND YOU GET TWO SHARKS.
AND WE'RE GONNA DROP OUR ROYALTY
FROM $10 TO $7.50.
SO, A TOTAL
OF $300,000 BACK?
Herjavec: YES.
RIGHT.
GUYS, YOU GOT TO
MAKE A DECISION.
[ WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY ]
YEAH.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, LORI.
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
LORI, YOU HAVE A DEAL.
YAY!
[ SIGHS ]
I REALLY WANTED IT.
YAY!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Michelle:
WE WENT WITH LORI BECAUSE
LORI HAS SO MUCH PASSION.
Jason:
REALLY FEELS LIKE
SHE -- SHE REALLY WANTS
TO GROW THE COMPANY.
YEAH, YOU CAN TELL THAT
SHE WANTS TO PARTNER WITH US.
