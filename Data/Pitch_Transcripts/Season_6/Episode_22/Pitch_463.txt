Alwan: I KEPT MY CHIN HIGH, BUT
INSIDE, IT WAS GUT-WRENCHING.
I TRULY DIDN'T HAVE
A GOOD ENOUGH BUSINESS PLAN.
I'M DAVE ALWAN OF ECHO VALLEY
MEATS FROM PEORIA, ILLINOIS.
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME
FROM SEASON 4
Alwan:
I BROUGHT MY SON, JORDAN.
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
THIS FOOD WAS DELICIOUS.
YEAH.
YEAH?
IT WAS AMAZING.
I REMEMBER IT.
Cuban:
WE ORDER IT THANKSGIVING.
WE ORDER IT EVERY CHRISTMAS.
I EAT THOSE CHEESE
GARLIC SPREAD THINGS
I'M JUST GONNA START EATING,
DAVE. I'M NOT EVEN WAITING
TILL THEY GET THEIRS.
PLEASE EAT.
EVERYTHING ON THERE
IS MY OWN RECIPE.
THESE ARE SO GOOD.
John: FANTASTIC.
SEE YOU, JORDAN.
LATER, JORDAN.
BYE, JORDAN.
BYE, JORDAN.
COME BACK WITH MORE.

WHAT HAPPENED TO SALES
AFTER YOU WERE ON THE SHOW?
SALES, AFTER THE SHOW,
EXPLODED.
BUSINESS HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER,
BUT I TOOK YOUR ADVICE
AS I RECALL, LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE, DAVE,
YEP. DAVE, HOW MUCH HAS
THE RETAIL BUSINESS,
THE OTHER BUSINESS,
GROWN?
12%, 15%.
IT DOES NOT NET QUITE AS MUCH
AS THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS.
RETAIL IS ABOUT 10% TO 12%.
MAIL-ORDER'S 18.3%.
MAN, YOU HAVE YOUR NUMBERS DOWN
THIS TIME.
SO, LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, ONE
OF MY ISSUES WAS COMPETITION,
FIGHTING THE BIG GUYS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
O'Leary: LET'S TAKE OMAHA.
THEY DISCOUNT AGGRESSIVELY
JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING.
THEY DO IT AGAIN
TOWARDS THE HOLIDAYS.
I MEAN, THEY MAKE
REALLY BIG OFFERS.
SURE.
Cuban: DAVE,
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT --
DOES IT MAKE SENSE
TO SPLIT THE BUSINESS?
I'M NOT SURE IT DOES.
O'Leary: OKAY, I'M GONNA MAKE
YOU AN OFFER. HERE IT IS.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE $150,000 FOR 20%.
I HAVE ONE OTHER COVENANT.
I WANT YOU TO SELL MY WICKED
GOOD CUPCAKES ON YOUR SITE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT
FOR FREE.
I WANT AN ALLOCATION
OF THEIR PROFITS TO YOU, TOO,
DAVE, I'LL GIVE YOU $300,000
FOR 35%.
FOR THE WHOLE COMPANY?
A PIECE OF EVERYTHING?
THE WHOLE STRUCTURE.
THANK YOU, DAVE.
LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
THANKS, DAVE.
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
Alwan: LAST TIME,
I FELT I BLEW AN OPPORTUNITY.
I WENT BACK,
CORRECTED MY MISTAKES,
