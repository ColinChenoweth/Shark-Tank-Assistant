MY NAME IS DAVE ALWAN,
AND I'M FROM PEORIA, ILLINOIS.
MY COMPANY IS ECHO VALLEY MEATS,
AND WE SPECIALIZE IN THE BEST
MEAT PRODUCTS IN THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.
HAVE A GREAT DAY.
I ACTUALLY PITCHED MY BUSINESS
ON "SHARK TANK"
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
AND WALKED AWAY WITHOUT A DEAL.
I CAN'T CALL YOUR BUSINESS PLAN
BAD BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE.
YOU MAKE A GREAT PRODUCT, BUT
YOU'RE COMING IN UNPREPARED.
THAT DOESN'T CUT IT.
I'M OUT.
Alwan: I KEPT MY CHIN HIGH, BUT
INSIDE, IT WAS GUT-WRENCHING.
I TRULY DIDN'T HAVE
A GOOD ENOUGH BUSINESS PLAN.
I KNEW I HAD TO GO BACK
AND DIG DEEP INTO MY COMPANY,
FIGURE OUT ALL MY COSTS, AND
COME UP WITH A BUSINESS PLAN,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID.
SO, WE FINALLY GOT THIS REPORT
BACK FROM THE UNIVERSITY,
AND NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT ENTAILS
TO ACQUIRE A NEW CUSTOMER.
NOW THAT I HAVE
THE MARKETING SIDE DOWN
AND MY CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION
COSTS DOWN, I KNOW MY NUMBERS.
I AM EXCITED.
I'M COMING BACK IN THE TANK
BECAUSE I WANT A DEAL.
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I WANT A SHARK AS A PARTNER.
THE SHARKS MIGHT HAVE GOT
THE BEST OF ME
THE FIRST TIME AROUND,
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU, THIS TIME,
I'M GONNA BLOW THEM
OUT OF THE WATER.
HI, AGAIN, SHARKS.
I'M DAVE ALWAN OF ECHO VALLEY
MEATS FROM PEORIA, ILLINOIS.
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME
FROM SEASON 4
AND MY DELICIOUS MEAT PRODUCTS.
[ Singsong voice ]
HE'S BA-ACK.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I DIDN'T GET A DEAL,
AND I WAS DEVASTATED,
BUT I WALKED OUT THOSE DOORS,
HELD MY HEAD HIGH.
YOUR TOUGH QUESTIONS
MADE ME GO HOME
AND SCRUTINIZE MY BUSINESS AND
BECOME A BETTER ENTREPRENEUR.
LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
I WAS ASKING FOR $300,000
FOR 20% EQUITY.
NOW I AM CUTTING IT IN HALF --
$150,000 FOR THE SAME 20% EQUITY
IN MY BUSINESS.
I AM HERE TO MAKE A DEAL.
MY COMPANY, ECHO VALLEY MEATS,
SPECIALIZES
IN THAT OLD-FASHIONED
BUTCHER-SHOP QUALITY,
AND WE DELIVER THE MOST
DELICIOUS MEATS AND TREATS
THROUGH OUR WEBSITE
AND GIFT CATALOG,
AND I KNOW THE MEAT
BUSINESS BETTER THAN ANYONE.
I CAN'T COME EMPTY-HANDED.
ALL RIGHT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Alwan:
I BROUGHT MY SON, JORDAN.
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
THIS FOOD WAS DELICIOUS.
YEAH.
YEAH?
IT WAS AMAZING.
I REMEMBER IT.
Cuban:
WE ORDER IT THANKSGIVING.
WE ORDER IT EVERY CHRISTMAS.
I EAT THOSE CHEESE
GARLIC SPREAD THINGS
AND GAIN ABOUT 15 POUNDS.
I HATE THOSE. DON'T BRING
THEM ANYWHERE NEAR ME.
Alwan: HAND THEM OUT.
Greiner: [ CHUCKLES ]
OH, THIS LOOKS GOOD.
LADIES FIRST, PLEASE.
OH, THANK YOU.
HERE WE GO AGAIN.
Herjavec:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
TO DIE FOR.
MR. O'LEARY.
THANK YOU, JORDAN.
THAT'S GREAT.
FOR YOU.
I'M JUST GONNA START EATING,
DAVE. I'M NOT EVEN WAITING
TILL THEY GET THEIRS.
PLEASE EAT.
EVERYTHING ON THERE
IS MY OWN RECIPE.
THESE ARE SO GOOD.
John: FANTASTIC.
SEE YOU, JORDAN.
LATER, JORDAN.
BYE, JORDAN.
BYE, JORDAN.
COME BACK WITH MORE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHAT HAPPENED TO SALES
AFTER YOU WERE ON THE SHOW?
SALES, AFTER THE SHOW,
EXPLODED.
BUSINESS HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER,
BUT I TOOK YOUR ADVICE
AND REALIZED THE ONE OPPORTUNITY
I HAVE TO SCALE
IS THE MAIL-ORDER INDUSTRY.
IT'S NOT MY RETAIL,
AND IT'S NOT MY CATERING.
WE DECIDED TO SPLIT
THE MAIL-ORDER OFF
INTO ITS OWN ENTITY NOW.
PRE-"SHARK TANK," LAST YEAR,
WAS ROUGHLY $190,000.
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE BROKE
$1.4 MILLION IN OUR MAIL ORDER.
Greiner: REALLY? WOW.
OH!
JUST THE MAIL-ORDER.
JUST THE MAIL-ORDER ALONE.
ARE YOU SELLING US TODAY
JUST THE MAIL-ORDER?
JUST THE MAIL-ORDER,
WHICH I FEEL HAS
THE MOST POTENTIAL TO SCALE.
AH. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ASKING
FOR LESS MONEY.
AS I RECALL, LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE, DAVE,
YEP. DAVE, HOW MUCH HAS
THE RETAIL BUSINESS,
THE OTHER BUSINESS,
GROWN?
12%, 15%.
IT DOES NOT NET QUITE AS MUCH
AS THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS.
RETAIL IS ABOUT 10% TO 12%.
MAIL-ORDER'S 18.3%.
MAN, YOU HAVE YOUR NUMBERS DOWN
THIS TIME.
SO, LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, ONE
OF MY ISSUES WAS COMPETITION,
FIGHTING THE BIG GUYS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
O'Leary: LET'S TAKE OMAHA.
THEY DISCOUNT AGGRESSIVELY
JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING.
THEY DO IT AGAIN
TOWARDS THE HOLIDAYS.
I MEAN, THEY MAKE
REALLY BIG OFFERS.
SURE.
AND THEY'RE ACQUIRING
CUSTOMERS THAT WAY.
IT'S VERY COMPELLING.
Alwan: AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY.
IT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT BETTER
BUYING POWER.
PRIME RIBS AND HAMS
DIP AFTER EASTER
BECAUSE NOBODY'S GONNA BUY
THOSE AGAIN UNTIL CHRISTMAS,
SO WHEN THE MARKET SOFTENS,
I CAN THEN TAKE THAT CASH
AND GET ALL OF MY INVENTORY
BOUGHT IN
AT A LOWER TIME OF THE YEAR
BECAUSE I KNOW THE MARKET
SO WELL.
I'M JUST CURIOUS. HOW LONG
CAN YOU BUY INVENTORY AHEAD?
THE USDA SAYS
THEY DON'T REALLY LIKE ANYTHING
LONGER THAN A YEAR.
SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS IS
REALLY MY RULE OF THUMB.
Herjavec: IF YOU BUY IT ON THE
10th MONTH VERSUS THE 6th MONTH,
DOES THE QUALITY CHANGE?
NO, BECAUSE IT'S VACUUM-PACKED
INTO OUR FREEZER.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.
YOU'RE COMING BACK IN HERE,
LEARNING FROM THINGS,
BUILDING YOUR BUSINESS
THAT BIG IN JUST A YEAR.
IT'S THE POWER
OF "SHARK TANK."
I THINK IT'S THE POWER
OF YOU.
I LOVE PEOPLE
THAT LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES,
Cuban: DAVE,
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT --
DOES IT MAKE SENSE
TO SPLIT THE BUSINESS?
I'M NOT SURE IT DOES.
O'Leary: OKAY, I'M GONNA MAKE
YOU AN OFFER. HERE IT IS.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE $150,000 FOR 20%.
I HAVE ONE OTHER COVENANT.
I WANT YOU TO SELL MY WICKED
GOOD CUPCAKES ON YOUR SITE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT
FOR FREE.
I WANT AN ALLOCATION
OF THEIR PROFITS TO YOU, TOO,
AND THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT
WITH THEM AS ENTREPRENEURS.
SURE.
SO MY OFFER, IN SUMMARY,
IS THIS --
I WILL GIVE YOU THE $150,000
FOR 20% OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS,
AND I WANT MY WICKED CUPCAKES
ON YOUR SITE.
Herjavec: WHOA.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THE <i>WHOLE</i> BUSINESS.
THE WHOLE BUSINESS?
YEP.
OH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPLIT
YOUR BUSINESS UP.
DAVE, I'LL GIVE YOU $300,000
FOR 35%.
FOR THE WHOLE COMPANY?
A PIECE OF EVERYTHING?
THE WHOLE STRUCTURE.
THANK YOU, DAVE.
LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
THANKS, DAVE.
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
Alwan: LAST TIME,
I FELT I BLEW AN OPPORTUNITY.
I WENT BACK,
CORRECTED MY MISTAKES,
AND IT FEELS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
TO GET A DEAL ON "SHARK TANK"
AND TO HAVE MARK CUBAN
AS A PARTNER.
DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER
THAN THAT.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN ACCESSORY COMPANY
FOR WHAT THE ENTREPRENEUR HOPES
WILL BE A HUGE NEW TREND.
