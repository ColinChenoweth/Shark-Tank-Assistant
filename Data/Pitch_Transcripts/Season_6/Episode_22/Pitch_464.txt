HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS BRIAN LIN.
Herjavec: BRIAN,
DOES OURS CHANGE COLOR?
O'Leary: SO, BRIAN,
HOW BIG IS GLOVING A MARKET,
BECAUSE YOU'VE IMPUTED A VALUE
ON GLOVING OF $13 MILLION,
'CAUSE YOU'VE ASKED ME
FOR $650,000 FOR 5%.
THAT IS A VERY BIG NUMBER,
THERE ARE FANS.
BRIAN, YOU'RE CREATING
YOUR OWN INDUSTRY.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT GLOVING IS
THAT IT'S NOT GENRE-SPECIFIC.
IT HAS GROWN
OUT OF THE EDM SCENE,
Herjavec: BRIAN, IT'S BRILLIANT.
IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA.
SO, BRIAN,
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'M GONNA STRUCTURE IT
IN A WAY THAT --
HE JUST SAID HE WANTS TO KEEP
THE BAD PEOPLE OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S WHY
I'M A GOOD PEOPLE.
IN MY VIEW, THE TRANSIENT NATURE
OF IT HAS ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.
BUT I CAN SEE SOMEONE HERE
WHO'S WORKING HIS TAIL OFF,
WHICH IS INTERESTING.
ALL RIGHT, BRIAN.
LOOK, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL, MAN.
WELL, HERE'S THE OFFER.
BRIAN,
ONCE YOU GET BIGGER,
YOU CAN DO BETTER
LICENSING DEALS THAN TODAY,
SO WHY COMMIT
FOR THAT TODAY?
SO, YOU GOT TO MAKE
A CALL, BRIAN.
BRIAN, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
THE DECISION.
$20 MILLION VALUATION.
$13 MILLION.
BRIAN HAS TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE
FOR HIS LIGHTED-GLOVE COMPANY
EmazingLights.
BRIAN, YOU'VE GOT
TO MAKE A DECISION.
$20 MILLION VALUATION.
$13 MILLION.
BRIAN, FOCUS. DECIDE.
WHAT'S IN YOUR GUT?
"I AM NOT WEIRD.
I AM LIMITED EDITION."
Herjavec: WELL, THIS IS CUTE.
"BE YOURSELF.
EVERYONE ELSE
IS ALREADY TAKEN."
