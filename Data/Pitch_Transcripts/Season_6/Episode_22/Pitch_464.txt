HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS BRIAN LIN.
I'M THE FOUNDER AND C.E.O.
OF THE EmazingLights.
TODAY WE'RE ASKING FOR $650,000
FOR 5% OF OUR COMPANY.
WOW.
SHARKS, PREPARE TO EXPERIENCE
THE LATEST DANCE CRAZE,
CALLED GLOVING.
OH, AND MR. WONDERFUL,
WE'RE GONNA BE BORROWING YOUR
HEART FOR THIS PERFORMANCE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
IF YOU CAN FIND IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ CHUCKLES ]
[ ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYS ]
? FACE MELT ?
[ CHUCKLES ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
COOL.
EXCELLENT.
VERY COOL.
THANK YOU
FOR THE PERFORMANCE, GUYS.
SHARKS, IT'S YOUR TURN
TO JOIN THE GLOVING MOVEMENT.
GUMMY, COULD YOU PLEASE,
UH, GIVE BACK
MR. WONDERFUL HIS HEART?
HE MIGHT BE NEEDING IT.
[ CHUCKLES ] THANK --
OH, I FEEL WARM AND FUZZY.
LILI'S GONNA BE
HANDING OUT
YOUR OWN PERSONALIZED
eLITE CHROMA GLOVE SETS.
Herjavec: BRIAN,
DOES OURS CHANGE COLOR?
O'Leary: SO, BRIAN,
HOW BIG IS GLOVING A MARKET,
BECAUSE YOU'VE IMPUTED A VALUE
ON GLOVING OF $13 MILLION,
'CAUSE YOU'VE ASKED ME
FOR $650,000 FOR 5%.
THAT IS A VERY BIG NUMBER,
AND I'M GONNA ASSUME
YOU HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE SALES
TO GET ME EXCITED ABOUT IT.
SINCE WE'VE STARTED
ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO,
WE'VE GROSSED
OVER $13 MILLION.
WOW.
IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR,
HOW MUCH WILL YOU SELL?
WE'RE PROJECTED FOR $5.5
MILLION, AND WE ARE ON TARGET.
JUST GLOVES?
GLOVES IS
OUR PRIMARY PRODUCT.
WE'VE CREATED
SOME ANCILLARY PRODUCTS
WITH THE PATENT-PENDING
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE,
BUT IT ACTUALLY GETS
BETTER THAN THAT, SHARKS.
I'VE TAKEN PROFITS
FROM EmazingLights,
WHICH I BOOTSTRAPPED
WITH $100,
AND I'VE CREATED ANOTHER COMPANY
CALLED iHeartRaves.
iHeartRaves CATERS
TO ALL THE FESTIVAL GOERS
AND PROVIDES ALL THE AWESOME,
WILD APPAREL.
iHeartRaves, IN 2013,
MADE OVER $1.4 MILLION,
AND THIS YEAR, WE'RE ON
STATE FOR $2.5 MILLION.
AND THESE TWO BUSINESS,
YOU'RE SELLING TOGETHER, RIGHT?
YES.
Herjavec: SO, JUST TO BE CLEAR,
YOU'RE SELLING BOTH,
AND IT'S $8 MILLION
IN SALES?
CORRECT.
WHOA.
THAT'S CLEVER.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
MY PARENTS IMMIGRATED HERE
TO ESCAPE COMMUNISM FROM CHINA.
GROWING UP AND SEEING THEM
WORK 18-HOUR DAYS
REALLY, REALLY HURT ME
AND JUST GAVE ME
THAT STRONG WORK ETHIC,
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO THROW AWAY
WHAT THEY HAD PROVIDED ME,
IN TERMS OF AN EDUCATION
IN THE U.S.
MARK, JUST LIKE YOU,
WHERE, INSTEAD OF SELLING
GARBAGE BAGS DOOR TO DOOR,
I WAS BURNING CDs
AND SELLING THOSE.
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN I WANTED
TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR.
DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT THE PRODUCT AND
SERVICE WAS GONNA BE.
FUNNY STORY -- MY GIRLFRIEND
ACTUALLY GOT ME INTO GLOVING.
I GAVE MY FIRST LIGHT SHOW,
AND I FELL IN LOVE,
BECAUSE I WAS ATTRACTING
CROWDS OF PEOPLE AROUND ME.
I'VE NEVER HAD
THAT FEELING BEFORE,
AND I WANTED TO SHARE THAT
WITH THE WORLD.
SO, THIS IS NOT PATENTED.
WE HAVE A PATENT PENDING,
AND THAT PATENT
IS PRIMARILY ON THE PROGRAMMING
METHOD OF THE LIGHTS.
SO OTHER PEOPLE
MAKE GLOVES WITH LIGHTS.
SOMEBODY ELSE COULD
MAKE GLOVES WITH LIGHTS,
BUT HOW MANY
OTHER PEOPLE ARE?
WE OWN 80%
OF THE GLOBAL GLOVING MARKET.
THE REST OF THE MARKET
IS MADE UP OF FOUR OR FIVE
OF OUR COMPETITORS,
AND I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THEY DO
NOT OPERATE AT THE SAME LEVEL.
HEY, LOOK.
NO, WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS AMAZING.
YOU KNOW, I LOVE TO CLAP
FOR ENTREPRENEURS.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
TO GO FROM $100
TO, YOU KNOW, HERE YOU ARE.
THE CHALLENGE, THOUGH, IS --
AND YOU KNOW IT --
THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE
THAT IT'S TRANSIENT...
RIGHT.
...THAT -- THAT IT'S A FAD.
BUT YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
BY MAKING SOMETHING A NICHE.
THERE'S -- JUST LOOK AT
THE GAMING INDUSTRY.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT
HAVE BECOME BIG NICHES, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
SO WHAT'S ONE OF THESE
GONNA COST ME?
ARE GLOVES RANGE FROM $20
FOR THE ENTRY LEVEL
ALL THE WAY UP TO $120,
WHICH IS THE eLITE CHROMAS
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
$20 MODEL AND THE $120?
PROGRAMMABILITY.
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THE COLORS
TO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
THE MODE.
WHAT'S YOUR MARGIN?
WHAT'S IT COST TO MAKE?
MARGIN RANGES
FROM $10 TO $17.
ARE YOU MAKING THIS
YOURSELF?
YES, WE DESIGNED IT,
DID ALL THE TOOLING
AND PROTOTYPING OVERSEAS.
WE HAVE GREAT CONNECTIONS
WITH OVER 20 FACTORIES.
SO, STRATEGICALLY,
WHAT DO YOU SEE NEXT?
I AM THE MOST EXCITED
ABOUT THE SPORT OF GLOVING.
THE SPORT?
IT'S BECOME
A PROFESSIONAL SPORT.
SO, INTERNATIONAL GLOVING
CHAMPIONSHIP
HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY US.
WE'VE CREATED THE RULES,
WE'VE CREATED THE JUDGES,
WE'VE CREATED THE FORMAT.
THEY COMPETE HEAD TO HEAD.
WHAT IS THE ESSENCE
OF THE SPORT?
LIKE, HOW DO I WIN?
Cuban: IT'S A PERFORMANCE.
WHOEVER PUTS ON THE BEST
PERFORMANCE, RIGHT?
EXACTLY.
BASICALLY, THIS IS
BREAK DANCING...
BREAK DANCING WITH A GREAT
PRODUCT TO FUND IT.
THAT YOU CAN SELL, YEAH.
THAT YOU CAN SELL.
WHEN BREAK DANCING
CAME OUT,
THIS IS BASICALLY THE FEEL
AND THE ENERGY OF THAT.
IT'S AN UNDERGROUND SWELL.
EXACTLY.
THERE ARE CREWS,
YOU KNOW, AGAINST CREWS.
THERE ARE FANS.
BRIAN, YOU'RE CREATING
YOUR OWN INDUSTRY.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT GLOVING IS
THAT IT'S NOT GENRE-SPECIFIC.
IT HAS GROWN
OUT OF THE EDM SCENE,
BUT IT'S GROWING INTO HIP-HOP
AND ALL OTHER TYPES OF MUSIC.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS ANYONE
THAT SEES GLOVING
THINKS
IT'S AUTOMATICALLY COOL.
IT'S NOW MY JOB TO GET IT IN
FRONT OF MILLIONS OF EYEBALLS,
AND I'M VERY,
VERY CONFIDENT
THAT WE CAN BUILD GLOVING
INTO A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.
Herjavec: BRIAN, IT'S BRILLIANT.
IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA.
YOU WENT OUT
AND CREATED A COMPETITION
TO CREATE THE DEMAND FOR IT.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
TELL ME -- HOW DO YOU SELL
THE PRODUCT TODAY?
SO, ABOUT 90%
WOULD BE ONLINE.
WE HAVE TWO RETAIL STORES
OURSELVES,
AND WE NOW HAVE THREE
LICENSED STORES, AND WE'RE --
SO, NOW THE GOAL IS,
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A
BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY,
YOU HAVE TO EXPAND REGIONALLY
AND, REALLY, GLOBALLY.
JAPAN IS DEFINITELY
A BIG MARKET FOR US NOW.
AUSTRALIA'S
GETTING INTO IT.
I FEEL LIKE I AM THE LID
ON OUR GROWTH.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT OUR HIRING PROCESS
KEEPS THE BAD PEOPLE OUT
AND I ONLY BRING IN PEOPLE
THAT HAVE A TRUE PASSION
FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT.
SO, BRIAN,
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'M GONNA STRUCTURE IT
IN A WAY THAT --
HE JUST SAID HE WANTS TO KEEP
THE BAD PEOPLE OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S WHY
I'M A GOOD PEOPLE.
IN MY VIEW, THE TRANSIENT NATURE
OF IT HAS ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.
BUT I CAN SEE SOMEONE HERE
WHO'S WORKING HIS TAIL OFF,
WHICH IS INTERESTING.
THE DIVERSITY
AND DIVERSIFICATION
OF REVENUE STREAMS
IS OF INTEREST TO ME
'CAUSE THAT
DIVERSIFIES RISK.
I'M GONNA LOAN YOU
$650,000.
I'M GONNA ASK
FOR 3% EQUITY,
BUT IT'LL GIVE YOU
THE FUNDS YOU NEED TO GROW.
KEVIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE OFFER,
BUT I WILL
HAVE TO DECLINE.
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHY
I'M HERE TODAY.
I'M LOOKING TO GET ONE OF
YOU SHARKS ON MY TEAM
TO HELP US
WITH THE DAY TO DAY.
SO, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANY
DEBT, IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I'VE NEVER GONE OUT AND LOOKED
FOR A LOAN FOR THIS COMPANY.
OKAY. I'M OUT.
SO, WHY IS THE OFFER
SO SMALL?
BECAUSE IF YOU WANT ONE OF US
TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING
TO COME WORK WITH YOU...
MM-HMM.
...WHY WOULD WE DO THAT
FOR 5%?
THE 5% WAS BECAUSE I'M NOT
REALLY LOOKING FOR THE MONEY.
I THINK YOU GUYS ARE
THE SMARTEST BUSINESSPEOPLE
ON THE PLANET.
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS TELL ME
WHAT PERCENTAGE MAKES SENSE
FOR YOU
TO JUMP INTO BED WITH US
AND GROW THIS INTO
A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY?
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
AN OFFER.
I WANT TO HELP YOU
WITH ALL THE LICENSING.
I CAN GET YOU
THE MARVELS OF THE WORLD,
AND I CAN GET YOU INTO
THE SPENCER'S AND PARTY CITYS,
IF THAT'S YOUR OBJECTIVE,
AND THE OTHER
BRAND EXTENSIONS.
I'LL GIVE YOU $650,000
FOR...
...20% OF THE LICENSING
THAT I BRING TO YOU.
Herjavec:
AND NOT THE COMPANY.
SO, NOT THE COMPANY.
THAT IS NOT
OF YOUR COMPANY.
I WILL GO OUT
AND GET YOU THE LICENSES.
I TAKE 20%.
I DON'T WANT ANY EQUITY.
ALL RIGHT, BRIAN.
LOOK, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL, MAN.
WELL, HERE'S THE OFFER.
BRIAN,
ONCE YOU GET BIGGER,
YOU CAN DO BETTER
LICENSING DEALS THAN TODAY,
SO WHY COMMIT
FOR THAT TODAY?
LORI AND I WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER YOU $1 MILLION
FOR 8% STRAIGHT-UP
EQUITY.
Cuban: OKAY, SO HERE'S
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO --
THE 650 GRAND, RIGHT,
5%, AND I'LL BE INVOLVED
ON THE STRATEGIC SIDE.
WE'LL DO A HALFTIME
WITH THE MAVS.
WE'LL TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS,
WE'LL LET YOU DO A PERFORMANCE
SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN UP
TO DALLAS. THAT'S EASY.
AND THEN DAYMOND,
AS PART OF THAT,
LIKE HE INTRODUCED EARLIER,
IS GONNA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE LICENSING
AND EARN A 20% COMMISSION
FOR WHAT HE LICENSES.
THAT'S THE OFFER.
OKAY.
SO, YOU HAVE THE SPORTS GUY AND
THE KIND OF MUSIC FASHION GUY
WHO'S GONNA WORK
WITH YOU,
OR YOU HAVE THE QUEEN OF QVC
AND THE SECURITY GUY.
WAIT A MINUTE. I'M IN RETAIL
EVERYWHERE AND INTERNATIONALLY.
LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW.
I CAN GET YOU INTO AN ARENA.
I WORK WITH LIVE NATION.
WE ALL DO IT.
LORI AND I WANT TO BE INVOLVED.
WE'RE GONNA CHANGE OUR OFFER.
MY FRIEND, WE WANT TO BE
PART OF YOUR TEAM.
$1 MILLION FOR 5%.
THAT'S A SERIOUS OFFER.
I'M GONNA SAY ONE THING.
WHO WOULD YOU
HANG OUT WITH?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NO, WAIT.
UGH.
THE ONE THING THAT YOU SAID WAS,
IT WASN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.
RIGHT?
IT WAS ABOUT
THE EXPERIENCE
AND IT WAS ABOUT THE GUIDANCE
AND IT WAS ABOUT THE SUPPORT.
RIGHT.
RIGHT?
THEY KEEP ON RESPONDING
BASED OFF THE MONEY.
NO, THAT'S CRAP.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.
SO, YOU GOT TO MAKE
A CALL, BRIAN.
BRIAN, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
THE DECISION.
$20 MILLION VALUATION.
$13 MILLION.
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE OFFERS?
YES, I DO.
WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?
Narrator:
ONE SHARK IS OUT.
BRIAN HAS TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE
FOR HIS LIGHTED-GLOVE COMPANY
EmazingLights.
MARK AND DAYMOND HAVE OFFERED
$650,000 FOR 5% EQUITY
AND 20% OF ANY LICENSING DEALS
THAT DAYMOND FINDS.
BRIAN, YOU'VE GOT
TO MAKE A DECISION.
$20 MILLION VALUATION.
$13 MILLION.
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE OFFERS?
YES, I DO.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
UM...I-I HOLD TRUE
TO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.
THE VALUATION DIFFERENCE
DOES NOT REALLY MATTER TO ME
RIGHT NOW.
I'M LOOKING
AT THE NON-CASH VALUE
AND WHAT YOU GUYS
CAN BRING TO THE TABLE.
I-IT'S VERY, VERY HARD
TO DENY, DAYMOND,
THE BRANDS THAT YOU HAVE BUILT
FROM THE GROUND UP.
LORI, I'VE HEARD STORIES
OF YOUR WORK ETHIC,
AND IT'S JUST MIND-BLOWING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I -- UM...
BRIAN, FOCUS. DECIDE.
WHAT'S IN YOUR GUT?
"I AM NOT WEIRD.
I AM LIMITED EDITION."
Herjavec: WELL, THIS IS CUTE.
"BE YOURSELF.
EVERYONE ELSE
IS ALREADY TAKEN."
MOST LINGERIE IS MADE FOR MEN,
AND IT'S MARKETED FOR MEN.
THIS IS FOR WOMEN,
SO WE PUT THE PRINTS
ON THE INTERIOR OF THE BRAS
BECAUSE IT'S FOR YOU.
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
IS INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE
AND JOINING ME IN CREATING
THE NEXT BIG LINGERIE BRAND?
TELL US ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
SO, THEY'RE $145,000
IN ABOUT 5? MONTHS.
WHAT DOES IT SELL FOR?
HOW DO YOU SELL IT?
SO, LET ME GIVE YOU
AN EXAMPLE.
THIS BRA SELLS FOR $60.
HOW MUCH DOES IT
COST YOU TO MAKE?
THAT PARTICULAR BRA IS $7.
OUR MARGINS ARE 72%.
WOW.
OKAY, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
O'Leary: CAN I ASK,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
WHY YOU THINK
AT THIS POINT
THIS BRAND, NAJA,
IS WORTH $10 MILLION?
WELL, IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW MUCH
MONEY WE'VE RAISED IN THE PAST.
WHY DO I CARE ABOUT THAT?
YOU KNOW,
I'M FROM SILICON VALLEY.
MARK'S FROM SILICON VALLEY.
HE KNOWS --
WELL, I GUESS HE'LL
GIVE YOU THE MONEY, THEN.
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT.
TELL US ABOUT THE VALUATION.
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU RAISE?
SO, WE RAISED $850,000
AT $5 MILLION
PRE-MONEY VALUATION
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
WHEN IT WAS JUST ON A NAPKIN.
WHY?
WHAT WAS
ON THE NAPKIN?
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M SORRY?
WHAT WAS ON THE NAPKIN?
THE PARTNER THAT
I HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO,
WHEN HE TALKED TO ME
ON THE PHONE FIRST,
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T
EVEN WANT A MEETING WITH ME,
HE SAID, "I'VE SEEN
SO MANY LINGERIE COMPANIES.
CHANCES ARE,
I'M GONNA SAY NO TO YOU."
I CONVINCED HIM,
AND WE ACTUALLY MET AT A BAR
OVER A GLASS OF WINE,
AND I SHOWED HIM
MY PROTOTYPES,
LIKE, JUST -- I HAD DRAWN.
I'M A DESIGNER,
BUT I'M AN MBA,
I'M A LAWYER,
ALL KINDS OF THINGS.
Cuban:
WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?
STANFORD.
OF COURSE YOU DID.
LET ME UNDERSTAND THIS.
WHAT'S UNIQUE TO YOU?
THAT'S -- GETTING THERE.
THAT'S NOT
WHAT MAKES A BRAND.
WHAT MAKES A BRAND IS,
ONE, YOU NEED TO LOOK INTO
OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.
SO, WHAT WE'RE DOING,
ON A SUPPLY-CHAIN LEVEL,
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT
ANYONE ELSE IS DOING.
WHAT YOU SEE
IN THE LINGERIE INDUSTRY
ARE THE LEAD TIMES
RIGHT NOW.
LEAD TIMES ARE OVER A YEAR.
YEAH, BUT A LOT OF THAT HAS
TO DO WITH SCALE, TOO.
UM, NO.
IT HAS TO DO
WITH HOW YOU BUY PRODUCT.
SO WE ACTUALLY OWN OUR OWN
SMALL MANUFACTURING FACILITY.
WE OWN OUR OWN SAMPLING
FACILITY.
WE OWN ALL
OF OUR RAW MATERIALS.
BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE
THE RAW MATERIALS,
I CAN HAVE A COLLECTION
FROM CONCEPT INTO THE STORE
IN FOUR MONTHS,
BUT I CAN REMAKE A COLLECTION
IN TWO TO THREE WEEKS.
ALL RIGHT, BUT IN THIS BUSINESS
OF LINGERIE,
BRAND IS EVERYTHING.
AND I KNOW YOU SAY
YOU HAVE A BRAND,
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY
'CAUSE NO ONE KNOWS NAJA YET.
OH, NO. WE DO.
