YOU ARE PROBABLY
THE BEST ENTREPRENEUR
WE'VE EVER HAD HERE.
YOU UNDERSTAND THE OFFERS?
$20 MILLION VALUATION.
$13 MILLION.
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT EACH
OTHER FOR A DEAL.
YOU SAID IT WASN'T
ABOUT THE MONEY.
THEY KEEP ON RESPONDING
BASED OFF THE MONEY.
OH, THAT'S CRAP.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
ONE MOMENT IT WAS THERE,
AND THEN POOF, YOU LOSE A DEAL.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
I'M SERIOUS, TOO.
NO. NOT HAPPENING.
OH, MY GOD.
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,
FOUNDED ONE OF
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
WHERE YOU RAN INTO PROBLEMS
WASN'T NECESSARILY
JUST VALUATION.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS.
KEVIN, THAT NUMBER IS $12,
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IT ONLY COSTS $1
TO RETAIN THAT CUSTOMER.
WE'VE HAD GREAT RETENTION --
BETWEEN 35% AND 40% HAVE CAME
BACK AND ORDERED MULTIPLE TIMES,
JUST LIKE MR. CUBAN.
Greiner: REALLY?
YES.
SO IN THE $1.4 MILLION,
WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT OF THAT?
UH, APPROXIMATELY
$260,000. 18.3%.
IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR,
HOW MUCH CASH
WILL THE MAIL-ORDER DIVISION
THAT YOU'RE SELLING
THIS EQUITY IN GENERATE?
WE ARE PROJECTING
ABOUT $1.8 MILLION
WITH A NET OF APPROXIMATELY
$400,000.
$400,000.
THIS IS A GREAT STORY.
BUT THERE'S ONE
LITTLE PROBLEM I HAVE.
BECAUSE I'M NOT
A BIG MEAT EATER,
I DON'T THINK
I'M THE BEST PARTNER
TO GO INTO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
ROBERT,
$300,000 FOR 35%?
KEVIN IS $150,000
FOR 20%.
O'Leary:
I MAY MODIFY MY OFFER.
I'LL PAY YOU $150,000
FOR 17.5%,
WHICH I THINK MATCHES
ROBERT'S VALUATION.
YEP.
BUT I STILL WANT
MY CUPCAKES ON YOUR SITE.
OF BOTH BUSINESS COMBINED?
YES, YES, YES.
HE'S OFFERING THE SAME VALUE
I AM, JUST LESS CASH.
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE UP
AS MUCH OF HIS FAMILY BUSINESS.
HOW DO YOU ALLOCATE
YOUR TIME
BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT
COMPANIES?
YOU PRIORITIZE IT,
IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
YOU SURROUND YOURSELF
WITH GREAT EMPLOYEES,
WHICH IS WHAT I'VE DONE,
AND YOU START TO DELEGATE.
MARK, ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN MAKING AN OFFER?
SO, I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000 FOR
25% OF YOUR MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS,
AND I WANT AN OPTION TO BUY
25% OF THE OTHER BUSINESS
FOR THE SAME $150,000.
IF EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS RIGHT
AND THE RETAIL BUSINESS
NOT REALLY AN IMPACT, GREAT.
IF IT TURNS OUT
YOU'RE SPLITTING YOUR TIME
OR SOMETHING TAKES YOUR TIME,
THAN I HAVE THAT OPTION.
SO, THAT'S MY OFFER.
BUT I WANT TO KNOW NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
MARK, YOU HAVE A DEAL.
DONE.
WOW.
[ CHUCKLES ] 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
I'LL JUST EAT MY MONEY'S WORTH.
[ LAUGHS ]
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU
FOR HAVING ME BACK.
I'M A FAN.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
IF YOU MOVE IT, ROBERT,
YOU'LL SEE YOUR COLORS.
OH, WOW!
Greiner: YOURS CHANGES
WHEN YOU DO THIS?
YEAH, SO DOES YOURS.
EVERYONE'S CHANGES.
THAT'S COOL.
YOU CAN HAVE
UP TO 50 MODES,
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE
ANY OF THE 20 COLORS
IN ANY COMBINATION
OR ORDER THAT YOU LIKE.
SHARKS, GLOVING
IS ALREADY MOVING
FROM A SUBCULTURE
TO POP CULTURE.
BEST ENTREPRENEUR
WE'VE EVER HAD HERE,
AND I THINK YOU NEED
SOME HELP WITH GROWTH.
HERE'S THE OFFER THAT LORI AND I
WANT TO MAKE YOU.
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE.
IN THE TRENCHES
TOGETHER.
RIGHT.
I THINK YOU GOT TO LICENSE IT.
THAT'S OKAY,
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO
GIVE UP 20% TO LICENSE IT.
YOU CAN DO THAT
THROUGH THE BUSINESS.
YOU CAN WORK OUT
THOSE DEALS --
OH, NO. YOU CAN'T.
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
NOT THAT EASY.
AND ROBERT AND LORI
HAVE OFFERED $1 MILLION
FOR 5% EQUITY IN THE COMPANY.
LORI, ROBERT, I KNOW I WOULD
DO VERY WELL WITH YOU GUYS.
MARK, DAYMOND, I WOULD LOVE TO
HAVE YOU GUYS AS MY PARTNER.
LET'S DO IT.
HIGH-FIVE, BABY!
YEAH!
OH!
THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME, GUYS.
UNBELIEVABLE.
I GOT TO TELL YOU --
I HATE LOSING THAT ONE.
YOU NEVER SEE A VALUE LIKE THAT
IN THE TANK.
Lin: I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT
JUST HAPPENED IN THE TANK.
I MEAN, IT'S MY WILDEST DREAM
COME TRUE.
I'M GONNA GET TO WORK
WITH DAYMOND AND MARK CUBAN.
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHAT MY WORKWEEK'S GONNA
LOOK LIKE ANYMORE.
I'M SO EXCITED.
Narrator:
EARLIER THIS SEASON,
WE SAW SIBLINGS
JEFF AND JEN MARTIN
MAKE A DEAL
WITH BARBARA CORCORAN
FOR THEIR MINI-POPCORN COMPANY
PIPCORN.
$200,000 FOR 10%.
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
Jeff: AFTER AIRING,
WE HAD ABOUT 12,000 ORDERS,
WHICH IS ABOUT 11,000 MORE
THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE.
IN YEAR LEADING UP
TO "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD $200,000 IN SALES.
IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS
SINCE WE CLOSED OUR DEAL,
WE HAVE OVER $1.1 MILLION
IN SALES.
HEY, JEFF, JEN!
HEY!
HEY!
Jeff: BARBARA WARNED US OF HUGE
SALES AFTER "SHARK TANK,"
BUT WE WEREN'T QUITE READY
FOR THE VOLUME.
WE WOUND UP IN A BIT
OF A BACK-ORDER SITUATION.
I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY
IT HAPPENED
SO THAT WE NEVER HAVE
THIS PROBLEM AGAIN.
Corcoran:
THE PROBLEM WITH BACK ORDERS
IS YOU CAN LOSE A LOT
OF VALUABLE CUSTOMERS.
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO WAIT.
WE WERE HONEST,
TOLD THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING,
AND THE PEOPLE
THAT WAITED THE LONGEST,
WE GAVE 50% OFF AND FREE
SHIPPING ON THE NEXT ORDER.
IT TOOK US TWO MONTHS TO FULFILL
ALL THE ORDERS, BUT WE DID IT.
AND NOW WE HAVE
A BIGGER BUSINESS.
YEAH.
YEAH.
CO-PACKERS HERE, THERE,
AND EVERYWHERE.
NOW WE HAVE CO-PACKERS IN
THE MIDWEST, ON THE WEST COAST.
WE CAN SELL AS MUCH PIPCORN
AS THE CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE.
GUYS, I'M JUST SO PROUD
OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF "SHARK TANK."
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE.
DID I EVER THINK I'D BE
INVESTING IN A POPCORN BUSINESS?
OF COURSE NOT, BUT HERE I AM
AT PIPCORN MAKING MONEY.
WHOA.
THERE IT IS.
WE STARTED IN A POT
AT A FARMERS' MARKET.
NEXT STOP...
NATIONWIDE.
IT'S TRULY AN AMAZING STORY
THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE LIVING,
AND EVERY DAY, WE'RE JUST
SO HAPPY TO BE DOING IT.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A WAY TO MAKE TRIPS
TO THE BEACH OR POOL WORRY-FREE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M ROB.
I'M JONATHAN.
AND I'M AVIN.
WE'RE THE INVENTORS
OF THE AquaVault.
WE'RE SEEKING
A $75,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 12% OF OUR COMPANY.
IF YOU'RE AT THE BEACH,
THE POOL, OR THE WATER PARK,
AND YOU WANT TO GO
FOR A SWIM,
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH YOUR VALUABLES?
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
ROBERT, DO YOU TUCK THEM
IN YOUR SHOES?
LORI, DO YOU ASK
THE SKETCHY GUY NEXT TO YOU
TO KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR STUFF?
MR. WONDERFUL,
ARE YOU CONSTANTLY LOOKING BACK
OVER YOUR SHOULDER
EVERY COUPLE OF MINUTES?
NOT ANYMORE.
Kinas:
INTRODUCING THE AquaVault --
A SIMPLE AND STYLISH
PORTABLE VAULT
TO SECURE YOUR VALUABLES
SO YOU CAN ENJOY THE SUN
WITHOUT GETTING BURNED.
JUST SET YOUR CODE,
INSERT YOUR VALUABLES,
CLAMP DOWN
OVER ANY FIXED OBJECT.
NOW YOU CAN STOP WORRYING
THAT SOMEONE'S SNOOPING AROUND,
READY TO GRAB
YOUR BELONGINGS.
JUST LOCK UP
AND GO FOR A WORRY-FREE SWIM.
Samtani:
SHARKS, WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO TAKE US TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
WHO WANTS TO LOCK UP
AND SWIM WITH US?
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I'M ALWAYS DOING THIS.
SOMEONE'S ALWAYS GOT TO
STAY BY THE TOWEL.
WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?
IT RETAILS FOR $39.95,
WHOLESALE FOR $22.95.
WE MAKE THEM FOR $10.86.
WE'VE ONLY DONE ONE ORDER
WITH THE FACTORY.
IT WAS A 5,000-UNIT ORDER, WHICH
WAS THE MINIMUM ORDER, SO...
O'Leary: SO, GUYS, TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.
I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN
YOUR COMPETITOR.
YOU HAVE?
YES.
I'VE BEEN PITCHED
THEIR DEAL.
SO, TELL US ABOUT
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.
SO, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE
A FEW DIFFERENT MODELS.
WE'RE TARGETING HOTELS DIRECTLY,
CRUISE SHIPS, THEME PARKS.
WE'RE ACTUALLY IN A MAJORITY
OF THE HOTELS
ON SOUTH BEACH RIGHT NOW
ON THE BEACH.
TELL US THE NUMBERS.
YEAR TO DATE,
WE'VE DONE $87,000 SALES.
THAT JUST STARTED
SIX MONTHS AGO.
WE HAVE A CONTRACT FOR ANOTHER
1,000 UNITS BY YEAR END,
SO WE'RE GONNA BREAK $100,000
WITHIN OUR FIRST YEAR.
YOU SELL THE HOTEL OR LEASE
THE SPACE FROM THE HOTEL
FOR THE UNITS AND CHARGE
THE CUSTOMERS ON THEIR BILL?
HOW DO I GET PAID?
Samtani: KEVIN,
WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS WE'RE SELLING THE UNIT
TO THE HOTELS
FOR OUR WHOLESALE PRICE.
THEY'RE THEN RENTING IT OUT
TO EACH GUEST
BETWEEN $5 AND $10 A DAY.
OKAY. DO YOU GET ANY MONEY
OFF RENTING IT?
NOT JUST YET. NO.
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE.
WE DEAL WITH A LOT
OF HOTEL CHAINS.
THEY ARE
INCREDIBLY FRUGAL.
WHY NOT GIVE THEM
TO THE HOTELS
AND THEN TAKE A SHARE
IN THEIR RECURRING REVENUE?
'CAUSE I DO SEE THAT.
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD PAY $5
TO $10 A DAY.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE THAT ROUTE?
WHAT AM I MISSING?
WE WERE JUST STARTING OUT,
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
A LOT OF HOTELS ARE
NOT GONNA WANT TO OPEN
UP THEIR BOOKS TO US
TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF REVENUE
THAT THEY'VE MADE.
THE WAY WE HAVE IT
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE SELLING IT TO THEM
WHOLESALE,
THEY'RE GETTING
THEIR R.O.I. BACK --
YEAH, AND PLUS YOU GET
YOUR CASH BACK RIGHT AWAY.
ABSOLUTELY.
RIGHT.
SO, WE HAVE
THREE DIFFERENT MODELS
WHICH WE'D LIKE
TO REALLY DO.
THE HOTEL PURCHASES
AT WHOLESALE PRICE.
THEY THEN
RENT IT OUT DAILY.
THE OTHER MODEL WOULD BE
THE GIFT-SHOP MODEL.
THE THIRD MODEL
IS THE IDEAL MODEL --
HAVE THEM
IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM,
ABOVE THE ACTUAL SAFES,
INSIDE THE ROOM,
SHRINK-WRAPPED,
WITH A POINT-OF-SALE SIGN.
THAT IS TOUGH.
MAYBE A "TAKE ME
WITH YOU" SIGN.
THAT'S REALLY HARD.
YEAH, THAT'S TOUGH.
PEOPLE IN VEGAS AND RESORTS,
THINGS LIKE THAT --
BEFORE YOU GO DOWN
TO THE POOL,
YOU'RE GONNA PUT YOUR STUFF
IN THE SAFE.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
BUT YOU'RE JUST GONNA
USE THE SAFE THAT'S
ALREADY IN THE HOTEL.
BUT WE LIVE IN A DAY
AND AGE RIGHT NOW
WHERE PEOPLE WANT THEIR
SMARTPHONES WITH THEM.
I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
YOU KNOW, I...
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $75,000 FOR 25%.
WE GREATLY APPRECIATE
THAT OFFER.
25% IS A LITTLE HIGH
FOR US.
YOU HAVE NO OTHER OFFERS.
IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT WE CAN OPEN UP
TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE
WANTS TO PARTICIPATE?
Samtani:
THERE ARE THREE OF US.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE LEFT
OUR CAREERS TO DO THIS.
GUYS, I MADE YOU AN OFFER.
$75,000 FOR 25%.
I DON'T MIND,
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE,
TO LISTEN IF THERE
WAS OTHER OFFERS,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO WAIT
FOR OTHER SHARK TANK TRASH TALK,
SO $75,000, 25%.
I DON'T HEAR ANY OTHER OFFERS
COMING. I HEAR A LOT OF TALK.
I WANT TO JUST ASK
ONE MORE QUESTION,
AND THEN MAYBE
I'LL BE INTERESTED OR NOT.
EXACTLY MY POINT.
GOT TO GET MY INFORMATION.
IS IT ONLY IN MIAMI
WHERE YOU'RE SELLING,
OR ARE YOU SELLING ONLINE,
AS WELL?
WELL, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE SELLING IT
WHERE WE GOT THE, YOU KNOW,
HOTELS IN MIAMI.
WE HAVE HSN.
WE HAVE A FEW CATALOGS.
YOU'VE BEEN ON HSN?
CORRECT.
Greiner:
HOW DID IT DO?
AND HOW DID THAT GO?
THEY PURCHASED
850 UNITS FROM US,
AND WE ALSO JUST FILLED
A PURCHASE ORDER
FROM TVSN
IN AUSTRALIA.
YOU GUYS ARE FAMILIAR
WITH THEM, RIGHT?
HOW DID THE, UM --
DID THEY ALL SELL OUT ON HSN?
WE SOLD 200 UNITS.
OH, REALLY.
John: LORI, HOW WAS
THAT PERFORMANCE?
GIVE ME THE ADVICE
'CAUSE THIS IS YOUR WORLD.
WELL, IT WASN'T
A GOOD PERFORMANCE.
THEY KNOW THAT.
OKAY, GUYS, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ONLINE?
SO, RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST BEEN
RELENTLESS REACHING OUT
TO THE P.R. OUTLETS,
MEDIA,
YOU KNOW, BLOGGERS,
MAGAZINE ARTICLES.
WE WERE FEATURED
ON THE "TODAY" SHOW,
WHICH DEFINITELY HELPED
TO GET OUR ORDERS UP,
BUT I'D SAY WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING
MORE ON THE COMMERCIAL END,
SO IT'S REALLY BEEN
AN 80/20 SPLIT.
YEAH, BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING
ALL THIS P.R.,
YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE
CARRYOVER ONLINE, RIGHT?
THERE DEFINITELY HAS.
HOW MANY UNITS
HAVE YOU SOLD ONLINE?
WE'VE SOLD ROUGHLY...
250.
...250.
WHOA.
WOW. THAT'S LOW.
BUT WAIT, WAIT.
THIS IS MORE OF A COMMERCIAL
PRODUCT IN OUR EYES.
IT WAS IN FOUR MONTHS,
RIGHT?
THAT'S LOW, GUYS.
MAYBE
THERE'S A PROBLEM.
WE HAVE -- WE HAVE
1,000 OTHER ONLINE VENDORS
SELLING THE PRODUCT RIGHT NOW,
OTHER THAN OUR WEBSITE.
Greiner: SO, WHAT WAS THE TOTAL
SALES THAT YOU DID?
$87,000.
$87,000.
IN SIX MONTHS.
$33,000 WAS HOTELS,
OF THAT.
$33,000 WAS THE HOTELS.
EVERYTHING ELSE
WAS DONE THROUGH --
AND THE REST WAS ONLINE.
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
THE MORE I HEARD,
THE MORE PROBLEMS I-I HEARD.
UM...
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND,
WE'RE NEW AT THIS.
WE REALLY JUST STARTED.
YEAH, I HEAR YOU,
BUT I HEAR MORE, UH, PROBLEMS
THAN I SEE OPPORTUNITY.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary:
OOH, LOOK AT THAT.
ONE MOMENT IT WAS THERE,
AND THEN, POOF, IT'S GONE.
THAT HAPPENS
IN THE SHARK TANK SOMETIMES.
YOU TALK TOO MUCH,
YOU CAN'T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT,
AND YOU LOSE A DEAL.
HAVE YOU SOLD
TO ANY OF THE WATER PARKS?
YES.
Samtani: YES.
WE'RE ACTUALLY AT THE RAPIDS
WATER PARK IN SOUTH FLORIDA.
WE'RE IN TALKS WITH WET 'N WILD
AND TYPHOON LAGOON RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE A DEAL WITH HSN,
AND I CAN BRING THE COSTS DOWN.
HERE'S MY OFFER --
$75,000 FOR 25%, AS WELL.
BUT I NEED THE ANSWER NOW.
LOOK, I LIKE DEALS
THAT ARE BIGGER
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET BIGGER.
IT'S A NICE PRODUCT --
GUYS, HE ALWAYS DOES THIS,
AND THEN HE JUMPS IN.
GIVE ME
A YES OR NO RIGHT NOW.
[ SIGHS ]
DAYMOND,
WE HAVE A DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
SMART MAN.
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD STUFF.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
I REALLY LIKED IT
WHEN I FIRST SAW IT, DAYMOND.
ROBERT, ROBERT,
THESE GUYS WERE SO BUSY
TRYING TO GET IT OUT TO THE
BEACH AND DO ALL THAT STUFF,
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO
CONCENTRATE ON THOSE SALES.
THAT'S ALL IT IS.
I WAS REALLY SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T SQUEEZE THEIR
HEAD A LITTLE HARDER.
Peck: NOW THAT WE HAVE
DAYMOND ON BOARD,
WE CAN GET OUR COSTS DOWN
AND GET THE AquaVault
OUT TO MORE RESORTS,
MORE PLACES THAN WE EVER THOUGHT
WE COULD BEFORE.
NICE!
WE DID IT.
CAME IN.
GOT THE DEAL.
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
SO HAPPY.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS WHAT THE ENTREPRENEUR HOPES
WILL BE A DISRUPTIVE BRAND IN
A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.
HI, SHARKS.
ROBERT.
I WILL NOT TRY IT ON.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOURS IS THE DOG.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LORI, YOURS IS
FROM OUR SPARROW COLLECTION,
WHICH IS MY FAVORITE.
OKAY.
MR. WONDERFUL, SINCE YOU'RE
THE SHARKIEST OF SHARKS,
I WENT THE OPPOSITE WAY,
AND YOURS IS THE KOALA
BECAUSE IT'S THE FURRIEST
AND HAPPIEST OF THEM ALL.
[ CHUCKLES ]
DAYMOND, YOU GET ONE
OF THE FIRST SAMPLES
FROM OUR NEW COLLECTION.
THANK YOU.
MARK, YOU GET
ROCKER GIRL BLUE
'CAUSE IT MATCHES
THE COLORS OF THE MAVS.
THAT WORKS.
Greiner: EACH ONE
HAVE A MESSAGE INSIDE?
THEY DO.
PROBABLY NOT THAT WELL.
I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST STRONG WOMEN.
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU WERE A MALE UP HERE
NEGOTIATING
THE SAME EXACT WAY.
"OH, THAT'S NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN. OH."
AND CORRECTING US
ALL THE TIME,
'CAUSE WE JUST WANT TO GET
THE INFORMATION.
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT WAS THE PROPER WAY.
ON ONE SIDE, HONESTLY,
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'VE SEEN BETTER DESIGNS.
THANK YOU.
SO, UM...
DAYMOND,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
