MY NAME IS CATALINA GIRALD,
AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND C.E.O.
OF NAJA.
I'M ASKING FOR $500,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
WE THINK IT'S TIME
FOR A NEW LINGERIE BRAND.
AT NAJA,
WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING PRODUCT
THAT'S BETTER THAN OTHER BRANDS
AT A FAIR PRICE, AND WE DO GOOD.
THROUGH OUR UNDERWEAR FOR HOPE
PROGRAM,
NAJA TRAINS AND EMPLOYS
SINGLE MOTHERS TO SEW
SO THAT YOU CAN
FEEL GOOD KNOWING
EVERY TIME THAT BUY A PRODUCT,
THAT YOU'RE HELPING
A WOMAN IN NEED.
NAJA IS DISRUPTING THE $14
BILLION U.S. LINGERIE INDUSTRY,
BUT BEFORE I GO
TO THE REST OF MY PITCH,
I'M GOING TO HAND OUT
SOME SAMPLES.
Herjavec:
CATALINA, YOU'RE NOT A BRAND.
YOU'RE STARTING OUT.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW YOU.
WHY IS THE BUSINESS WORTH
$10 MILLION? OR $9 MILLION?
BECAUSE SOM-- BECAUSE
SOMEONE ELSE SAID YES.
MARKET SETS THE PRICE.
COULD I TAKE A PORTION
OF $9 MILLION
AND EMULATE THIS
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?
NO. NO.
WHY?
WELL, I DON'T
AGREE WITH YOU.
YOU'RE NOT INVESTING
IN MY COMPANY
BASED ON TODAY'S VALUATION.
WHY NOT?
THIS IS NOT --
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY
IT WORKS.
IF YOU WERE TO INVEST
IN THIS --
[ CHUCKLING ]
OH, IT WORKS THAT WAY FOR ME.
YOUR SALES ARE SQUAT.
WAIT.
TELL HIM HOW IT WORKS.
WE ARE GROWING.
WE'VE DOUBLED OUR SALES,
MONTH OVER MONTH,
OVER THE PAST QUARTER.
FROM PEE-PEE TO PEE-PEE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T
SPEND MONEY TO GET THAT PEE-PEE.
SO WE DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY,
AND IT STILL KEEPS SELLING.
Cuban: I WANT TO KNOW
THE AVERAGE ORDER.
GIVE ME YOUR METRICS, THEN.
OKAY, SO OUR AVERAGE ORDER
IS $80.
OKAY.
THE CONVERSION FROM
ONE COLLECTION TO THE NEXT --
THE REPEAT PURCHASE
PERCENTAGE -- IS 14%.
THERE -- THAT'S A METRIC
THAT'S SCARY.
THAT'S --
IT'S ACTUALLY HIGH, MARK.
NOT FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
WHEN YOU'RE SMALL.
IN A START-UP COMPANY WHERE YOU
HAVE UNIQUE ATTACHMENT TO PEOPLE
BECAUSE YOU'RE NEW,
THEY FOUND YOU,
NOW'S THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY
SHOULD BE MOST EXCITED
AND MOST SHARING
AND REORDERING THE MOST.
SO, AGAIN, THE REPEAT-PURCHASE
PERCENTAGE
FROM ONE COLLECTION
TO ANOTHER IS 14%.
HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT
IN A VACUUM LIKE THAT.
AND SO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WITH TWO COLLECTIONS,
YOU CAN COME
TO THAT CONCLUSION.
Herjavec:
THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT, RIGHT?
WELL, I THINK THAT YOU
SHOULD STOP CORRECTING
US ON WHAT WE THINK.
I MEAN, THIS EARLY,
THERE SHOULD BE SUCH
A PASSIONATE RESPONSE TO YOU,
SUCH A PASSIONATE RESPONSE TO
WHATEVER COLLECTION YOU PUT UP,
PARTICULARLY SINCE
YOU'RE ONLINE, THAT 14% IS LOW.
RIGHT?
WHETHER IT'S VALUATION
OR, YOU KNOW,
HOW YOU SEE THE FUTURE,
I THINK THERE'S A DISCONNECT,
AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY. I APPRECIATE IT.
BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS.
I DON'T SEE IT TODAY
AT THAT VALUE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY. APPRECIATE IT.
UM...
O'Leary: I THINK
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
I THINK YOU MADE
THE ASSUMPTION
THAT JUST 'CAUSE SOMEONE ELSE
OUTSIDE OF SHARK TANK
WOULD PAY YOU A RIDICULOUS
MULTIPLE FOR YOUR BUSINESS --
BEYOND RIDICULOUS --
THAT YOU COULD BRING THAT
IN HERE AND USE IT AS PROOF
THAT YOU'RE WORTH $9 MILLION
OR $10 MILLION.
AN MBA IS NOT A PREREQUISITE
FOR SUCCESS AT ALL.
I HAVE ONE, TOO.
UNDERSTOOD.
WHO CARES?
YOU HAVE TO GO MAKE MONEY
FOR INVESTORS.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S WORTH
ABOUT 1.5 MILLION BUCKS.
AND IF I WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU $500,000,
I'D NEED A PREMIUM ON IT.
I MEAN, I THINK,
MAYBE...50/50.
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
I'M SERIOUS, TOO.
NO. NOT HAPPENING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
OKAY.
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
I'M OUT.
IF I HAD TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
TO LEARN FROM THIS
THAT I DO THINK
IS IMPORTANT,
WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN HERE THAT SAY,
"I'M FROM SILICON VALLEY,
SO THEREFORE I'VE RAISED
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS."
AND THEY'RE SO IN LOVE
WITH RAISING MONEY
THAT THE BRASS TACKS OF ACTUALLY
SELLING SOMETHING GETS LOST.
I'M OUT.
DAYMOND IS
THE ONLY ONE LEFT.
SO, HOW DO YOU THINK
YOUR NEGOTIATION STYLE
HAS WORKED TODAY?
UM...
DAYMOND IS CATALINA'S
LAST CHANCE
TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR HER LINGERIE COMPANY NAJA.
DAYMOND,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOUR VALUATION AT $10 MILLION --
I-I CAN'T COME CLOSE TO THAT.
LOOK, WHEN YOU SAT DOWN
WITH THE V.C.s IN THE VALLEY,
YOU HAD TO DO
SOME SORT OF PROJECTION.
MM-HMM.
RIGHT?
SO, ONE-YEAR, THREE-YEAR
PROJECTIONS IN SALES,
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
WHAT ARE MY PROJECTIONS
FOR THIS COMPANY?
OR DID THEY NOT CARE?
AT THAT POINT,
THEY DIDN'T CARE.
WOW.
THAT'S AMAZING.
WHAT DO YOU PROJECT YOUR SALES
TO BE IN TWO YEARS?
FOURT-- ABOUT $14 MILLION
IN REVENUE A YEAR.
John: I'M JUST CURIOUS.
AND THEN THE YEAR AFTER?
BUT WHERE DO YOU GET THAT
PROJECTION FROM? WAIT.
I HAVE TO --
I HAVE TO SOBER THIS DOWN.
FROM THE AIR.
I WONDER WHERE PEOPLE COME UP
WITH THESE REALLY HUGE,
WHAT I CONSIDER
SOMEWHAT CRAZY PROJECTIONS.
AND THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR LINE.
Herjavec: CATALINA,
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO GO FROM $140,000
TO $14 MILLION?
EVEN IN SILICON VALLEY,
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
TO GET TO THAT LEVEL?
ORACLE DIDN'T DO IT
IN THAT RATE.
MICROSOFT DIDN'T DO IT
AT THAT RATE.
THERE IS ALREADY MONEY IN THERE,
AND I THINK IT'S STUPID MONEY.
AND I'M -- I'M MAD
THAT IT WAS VALUED AT THAT.
BECAUSE I WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALL IN.
SO, WITH THAT, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
GOOD LUCK.
I JUST READ THIS NOTE
ON THE PANTIES, AND IT SAID,
"I'M NOT WORTH
$10 MILLION."
