MY NAME IS CATALINA GIRALD,
Herjavec:
CATALINA, YOU'RE NOT A BRAND.
YOU'RE STARTING OUT.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW YOU.
WHY IS THE BUSINESS WORTH
$10 MILLION? OR $9 MILLION?
BECAUSE SOM-- BECAUSE
SOMEONE ELSE SAID YES.
MARKET SETS THE PRICE.
COULD I TAKE A PORTION
OF $9 MILLION
DAYMOND IS CATALINA'S
LAST CHANCE
TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR HER LINGERIE COMPANY NAJA.
DAYMOND,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOUR VALUATION AT $10 MILLION --
I-I CAN'T COME CLOSE TO THAT.
LOOK, WHEN YOU SAT DOWN
WITH THE V.C.s IN THE VALLEY,
YOU HAD TO DO
SOME SORT OF PROJECTION.
MM-HMM.
RIGHT?
SO, ONE-YEAR, THREE-YEAR
PROJECTIONS IN SALES,
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
WHAT ARE MY PROJECTIONS
FOR THIS COMPANY?
OR DID THEY NOT CARE?
AT THAT POINT,
THEY DIDN'T CARE.
WOW.
THAT'S AMAZING.
WHAT DO YOU PROJECT YOUR SALES
TO BE IN TWO YEARS?
FOURT-- ABOUT $14 MILLION
IN REVENUE A YEAR.
Herjavec: CATALINA,
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO GO FROM $140,000
TO $14 MILLION?
EVEN IN SILICON VALLEY,
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
TO GET TO THAT LEVEL?
ORACLE DIDN'T DO IT
IN THAT RATE.
MICROSOFT DIDN'T DO IT
AT THAT RATE.
