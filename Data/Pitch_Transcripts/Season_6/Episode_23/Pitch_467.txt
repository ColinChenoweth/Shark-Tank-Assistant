I AM MIKAILA.
AND I AM HER DAD, THEO.
I'M 9 YEARS OLD,
AND I'VE HAD MY BUSINESS
FOR OVER HALF OF MY LIFE.
MIKAILA'S ALWAYS LOVED
BUSINESS.
EVER SINCE
SHE WAS 4 YEARS OLD,
WE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS
A NATURAL ENTREPRENEUR.
AH, THERE YOU GO.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
ME AND MY BROTHER, JACOB,
WOULD SET UP A STAND
AND SELL LEMONADE,
ARTS AND CRAFTS,
PAINTED ROCKS.
ANYTHING THAT WE COULD
MAKE OURSELVES,
WE WOULD SELL IT.
ONE PRODUCT
WAS A TOP SELLER,
AND I KNEW WE COULD MAKE THAT
A REAL BUSINESS,
SO I ASKED MY PARENTS
FOR HELP,
AND THAT'S HOW MY BUSINESS
WAS BORN.
WHAT'S THE UPDATE ON FINANCE?
NOW EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY
WORKS FOR MY COMPANY.
RUNNING A BUSINESS
ISN'T EASY.
BETWEEN GOING TO SCHOOL
AND WORKING ON BUSINESS,
I'M AS BUSY AS A BEE.
HERE'S YOUR ORDER.
Woman: THANK YOU.
ENJOY.
I KNOW THE SHARKS
ARE GONNA LOVE MY PRODUCT,
AND I HOPE THEY GIVE ME
A REALLY SWEET DEAL.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S MIKAILA ULMER.
AND I'M THEO ULMER,
MIKAILA'S DAD.
I'M THE OWNER OF
BeeSweet LEMONADE,
AND TODAY,
I'M HERE TO ASK FOR
$60,000 FOR 10% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TRIED SOMETHING
SO GOOD AND REFRESHING
AND WONDERED,
"COULD THIS BE GOOD FOR ME?"
WELL, SHARKS, GUESS WHAT?
I CREATED A PRODUCT
THAT IS BOTH GOOD FOR YOU
AND TASTES GREAT
AT THE SAME TIME.
MY PRODUCT IS LEMONADE,
BUT NOT JUST ANY LEMONADE --
HONEYBEE SWEETENED
LEMONADE
WITH A VERY SPECIAL
INGREDIENT -- FLAXSEED.
WHEN I WAS IN KINDERGARTEN --
YES, 4? YEARS OLD --
I SIGNED UP IN THE YOUTH
ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONTEST.
WHILE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT PRODUCT TO CREATE,
TWO BIG EVENTS HAPPENED --
I GOT STUNG BY TWO BEES
IN ONE WEEK,
AND MY GREAT-GRANNY HELEN
SENT ME A 1940s COOKBOOK
WITH HER FAVORITE RECIPE
OF FLAXSEED LEMONADE IN IT.
I DIDN'T ENJOY THE BEE STINGS
AT ALL,
BUT I BECAME FASCINATED
WITH BEES
AND WHAT THEY DO
IN OUR ECOSYSTEM,
THAT I DECIDED TO CREATE
A PRODUCT
THAT HELPS SAVE THE BEES
AND USES MY GREAT-GRANNY HELEN'S
RECIPE, AS WELL,
AND THAT'S HOW BeeSweet
WAS BORN.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE
FOUR FLAVORS --
THE ORIGINAL MINT, HALF-AND-HALF
TEA AND LEMONADE,
GINGER,
AND ALSO PRICKLY PEAR.
OUR SIMPLE INGREDIENTS
HAVE ADDED HEALTH BENEFITS
TO PROVIDE A FUNCTIONAL,
FLAVORFUL TWIST.
BeeSweet LEMONADE OFFERS
THE CONSUMER
A HEALTHIER
BEVERAGE ALTERNATIVE.
SO, SHARKS, WHICH ONE OF YOU
WILL BE SWEET, JOIN MY TEAM,
AND HELP ME BUILD
MY AMERICAN DREAM?
LEMONADE, ANYONE?
ABSOLUTELY!
[ CHUCKLES ]
BRING IT ON,
MIKAILA.
SO CUTE.
WHAT FLAVOR IS THIS,
MIKAILA?
THIS IS GINGER.
THAT'S HALF AND HALF
TEA AND LEMONADE.
Herjavec: IT'S GREAT.
Theo:
HE GETS THE ORIGINAL.
Mikaila:
AND THIS IS THE ORIGINAL.
THE ORIGINAL!
THANKS, GUYS.
IT'S GOOD.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M 9 YEARS OLD.
9 YEARS OLD?
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
REALLY? WOW.
YOU REALLY ARE POISED
AND HANDLE YOURSELF GREAT.
WOW.
TELL US A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
ARE YOU SELLING?
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
ACTUALLY
FOR FIVE AND A HALF YEARS,
AND, UH, YEAR TO DATE,
WE'VE GOT $25,000
IN ACTUAL SALES THROUGH AUGUST.
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
THE PRODUCT?
WHOLE FOODS MARKET.
Greiner: GREAT.
WE'RE CURRENTLY SOLD IN OVER
30 LOCATIONS IN FOUR CITIES,
BUT WE RECENTLY RECEIVED
AN OPPORTUNITY
TO EXPAND WITHIN
THE ENTIRE SOUTHWEST REGION,
WHICH COVERS
FOUR STATES.
TELL US ABOUT THE FLAXSEED
AND THE IMPACT.
WELL, I CAN'T TELL
HOW I GET THE FLAXSEED IN THERE,
BECAUSE IT'S MY
GREAT-GRANNY HELEN'S
TRADE SECRET.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I ONLY TELL THAT
TO MY BUSINESS PARTNERS.
Cuban: [ LAUGHS ]
SMART GIRL!
SMART GIRL.
THAT IS AWESOME
RIGHT THERE.
WHAT'S THE --
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT TO IT?
WELL, FLAXSEED IS A SEED
PACKED WITH OMEGAS AND FIBER.
IT KEEPS YOU GOING.
THEO, WE KNOW
ABOUT MIKAILA'S BACKGROUND,
AND SHE'S HIGHLY QUALIFIED.
Theo: RIGHT.
TELL US ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND.
SO, BETWEEN MY WIFE
AND I,
WE'VE GOT OVER 40 YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE
IN MARKETING, OPERATIONS,
AND FINANCE.
ARE YOU FULL-TIME AT THIS?
MY WIFE'S ACTUALLY FULL-TIME
WITH IT RIGHT NOW,
AND, UH, THIS IS MY SECOND
FULL-TIME JOB, SO --
THEO, WHERE DID YOU WORK
BEFORE THIS?
I WORKED AT XEROX,
AND I ALSO WORKED
AT DELL COMPUTER.
WHAT ARE THE PLANS
FOR THE $60,000?
WHAT I'M GONNA DO
WITH THE $60,000 IS
I'M GONNA MAKE MORE PRODUCT
SO I CAN LAUNCH
INTO THE WHOLE SOUTHWEST REGION.
WHERE DO YOU
MANUFACTURE THIS TODAY?
WELL,
IT'S IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.
WE HAVE A LOCAL CO-PACKER
WHO MANUFACTURES IT FOR US.
HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE FOR IT
AT RETAIL?
BETWEEN $2.75 AND $3.00.
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT, MIKAILA?
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT?
$1.50.
MIKAILA, WHAT'S YOUR
BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IN YOUR BUSINESS RIGHT NOW?
UM, IT'S PROBABLY FITTING SCHOOL
AND BeeSweet LEMONADE
AND ALL THE OTHER ACTIVITIES
THAT I MIGHT WANT TO DO --
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
SCHOOL HAS GOT TO GO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DOES IT CONCERN YOU THAT
YOU ONLY HAVE $25,000 IN SALES
AFTER FIVE AND A HALF YEARS?
NO. NO, NOT -- NOT REALLY,
BECAUSE THAT'S --
IT CONCERNS ME.
THAT'S NOT
A TOTAL IN SALES.
THIS YEAR TO DATE.
CORRECT?
CORRECT.
WE JUST STARTED
IN WHOLE FOODS
IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR
WITH ONE STORE,
AND EACH MONTH,
WE'VE GROWN.
WOW.
DO YOU FIND $3.00 IS
A PREMIUM PRICE FOR LEMONADE?
'CAUSE I FIND IT EXPENSIVE.
$2.99 IS A LOT
FOR A JAR OF LEMONADE.
WELL, IF WE'RE ABLE
TO SCALE THE BUSINESS,
YOU KNOW, WE CAN, UH, LOOK AT
SOME SORT OF PRICE ADJUSTMENT.
WHAT CAN YOU GET
THE PRICE DOWN TO?
WE CAN GET THE COST
DOWN BELOW $1.00.
HOW MANY UNITS
WOULD YOU HAVE TO BUY
TO GET THAT COST DOWN TO THAT?
WE -- WE WOULD NEED TO PRODUCE
AROUND 2,700 BOTTLES.
GOTCHA.
SO, WHEN YOU GO INTO
THE SOUTHWEST REGION...
MM-HMM.
...WOULD YOU THEN HAVE AN ORDER
FOR 2,700 BOTTLES?
WE BELIEVE
BY THE SECOND QUARTER,
WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH VOLUME
TO GET US TO 3,000 GALLONS
PER SKU,
AND THEN WE CAN LOWER THAT COST.
GUYS, I LOOK AT THIS AS
A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET.
NOT TO SAY THAT MIKAILA
ISN'T FANTASTIC.
THE GUTS TO COME IN HERE
AND PITCH US --
THAT TAKES A LOT.
BUT YOU'RE NOT COMMITTED,
MIKAILA.
YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.
AND I WANT MY C.E.O. FULL TIME,
SO COME BACK
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY READY
TO SAY, "SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER,"
AND WE'LL TALK.
UNTIL THEN, I'M OUT.
MIKAILA, WE SEE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ON THE SHOW.
SOME THINGS ARE MORE COMPETITIVE
THAN OTHERS.
THE DRINK MARKET LIKE THIS
AT A STORE LEVEL,
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO BRAND
AND SHELF SPACE,
WHICH IS DIFFERENT
THAN NECESSARILY
THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.
SO, FOR ME, IT'S JUST
A REALLY TOUGH MARKET.
I-I'M OUT.
SO, A COUPLE OF THINGS --
UM, YOU MENTIONED
COM-- COMMITMENT,
AND YOU MENTIONED
SHELF SPACE.
FIRST, SHE STARTED THIS
WHEN SHE WAS 4? YEARS OLD.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AND SHE'S BEEN DOING IT
FOR FIVE YEARS.
SO, OVER HALF HER LIFE,
SHE'S BEEN SELLING LEMONADE.
SO I-I-I WOULD DISAGREE
THAT, UH,
THERE'S A LACK OF COMMITMENT.
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S NOT WILLING
TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL YET,
SHE'S VERY MUCH COMMITTED.
Cuban: [ LAUGHS ]
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A QUESTION OF COMMITMENT.
FOR FIVE YEARS.
DEFINITELY COMMITTED,
AND AS FAR AS --
YOU CAN'T TAKE
HIS QUESTION SERIOUSLY.
YEAH.
YES, YOU CAN.
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
AS FAR AS SHELF SPACE --
NO. YOU CAN'T.
WE'VE ALREADY --
WE'VE ALREADY --
WE'VE ALREADY GOT
THE SHELF SPACE,
AND WE'VE GOT
AN OPPORTUNITY --
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THEO,
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN -- MIKAILA,
YOU'RE AMAZING, RIGHT?
I MEAN,
Y-YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS,
YOU'RE NOT QUITE A COMPANY YET.
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ME,
WHILE THIS IS A GREAT START,
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE BEST
THAT MIKAILA'S GOING TO DO.
I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S
SO MUCH BETTER AHEAD FOR HER,
SO COME BACK, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU GRADUATE
FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL.
YOU'LL PROBABLY OWN
HALF THE PLACE.
UM, BUT WE WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Greiner: YOU KNOW, MIKAILA,
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO SAY OFTEN
I CAN TELL
IF SOMETHING OR SOMEONE
IS A HERO OR A ZERO.
HERO OR A ZERO.
YOU ARE DEFINITELY A BIG HERO.
I THINK YOU'RE DOING
EVERY SINGLE THING RIGHT,
AND YOU'VE COME IN
WITH WHAT I THINK
IS ONE OF THE BEST LOGOS
I'VE EVER SEEN FOR LEMONADE.
IT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU.
I HAVE STRUGGLE HERE,
BECAUSE I CAN'T DRINK LEMONADE.
I AM ALLERGIC.
SO, I COULDN'T TRY IT.
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
WELL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
ONE SHARK LEFT.
DAYMOND.
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
DAYMOND IS THEO AND MIKAILA'S
LAST CHANCE AT A DEAL
FOR THEIR COMPANY,
BeeSweet LEMONADE.
ONE SHARK LEFT.
DAYMOND.
MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS
I DON'T KNOW THE SPACE.
BUT I JUST DID A DEAL
WITH A COMPANY CALLED HLA
OUT ON THE EAST COAST.
THEY'RE A DISTRIBUTOR
TO ALL THE "C" STORES --
"C" STANDS FOR
"CONVENIENCE."
CONVENIENCE STORES,
BASICALLY.
SO, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
AN OFFER,
AND THE OFFER IS THIS --
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $60,000
FOR 25%...
...CONTINGENT THAT
MY PARTNERS ON THE EAST COAST
THAT DISTRIBUTE TO "C" STORES,
CONVENIENCE STORES,
WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT
IN THE STORES.
IF THEY CANNOT GET IT IN,
WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL.
AND THE REASON I NEED 25% IS
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SPLIT
THIS PARTNERSHIP UP ON MY SIDE.
DAYMOND HAS MADE YOU AN OFFER.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
IT'S A DEAL.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
ALL RIGHT.
Greiner:
CONGRATULATIONS!
CONGRATS, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU!
CONGRATS, MIKAILA!
THANK YOU.
Greiner: CONGRATS!
NICE JOB.
YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB.
UM, I'M REALLY EXCITED
THAT DAYMOND'S MY NEW PARTNER,
AND I THINK THAT HE'LL BE
A GREAT MATCH
FOR BeeSweet LEMONADE.
Corcoran:
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN,
AND I'VE DECIDED TO INVITE
MY MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS
TO MY HOUSE IN UTAH.
WELCOME TO THE MOUNTAINS!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THIS YEAR, I'VE INVITED
GRACE AND LACE, PIP SNACKS,
VILLY CUSTOM, RY'S RUFFERY,
DAISY CAKES, CEREBRAL SUCCESS,
AND, OF COURSE,
COUSINS MAINE LOBSTER.
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
TOTAL SALES
FOR ALL SEVEN BUSINESS
WERE ABOUT $2 MILLION.
SINCE MAKING A DEAL WITH ME
ON "SHARK TANK,"
TOTAL SALES
ARE OVER $24 MILLION.
WE'RE HERE TO SHARE
OUR TRADE SECRETS,
AND WE'RE ALL GONNA GO HOME
A HECK OF A LOT SMARTER.
I LIKE MY ENTREPRENEURS
TO SHARE THEIR HIGHS AND LOWS,
FIGURE OUT WHICH STRATEGIES
WORKED AND WHICH ONES DIDN'T
AND COLLECTIVELY BECOME
STRONGER BUSINESSES.
HAVING THE CO-PACKER HAS
HELPED US SPEND MORE TIME
FIGURING OUT
HOW TO GROW THE BUSINESS.
WHETHER IT'S
THE WEB DEVELOPMENT TEAM
OR SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION,
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT YOU EXIST.
YOU GUYS GAVE US
A TON OF INSIGHT.
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO BE PART OF
A FAMILY LIKE THIS.
EVERYBODY CARES
ABOUT EVERYBODY,
AND IT'S BECAUSE
IT STARTS WITH BARBARA.
IT'S SO INSPIRING.
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF
ONE PERSON'S VISION.
Corcoran: THIS RETREAT
IS ALL ABOUT SHARING IDEAS,
BUT MY FAVORITE PART IS
SOME FUN ON THE SLOPES.
READY TO GO SKIING?
[ ALL CHEER ]
Tselikis:
IT'S BEEN 2? YEARS SINCE BARBARA
CAME INTO OUR LIVES,
AND WE'RE NOW AT $6.5 MILLION
IN SALES.
Hiltbrand:
BARBARA SET UP A MEETING
WITH GNC WITH ONE PHONE CALL.
NOW WE'RE LAUNCHING
IN 1,100 GNC STORES,
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE STOKED.
Nelson: TO THINK THAT MY MOTHER
AND I WENT FROM $27,000
TO NOW $3.1 MILLION
HAS REALLY BEEN LIFE-CHANGING.
Hinnant: BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD OVER $1 MILLION IN SALES,
AND NOW WE'VE GROSSED
OVER $10.5 MILLION IN SALES.
TO MY FAMILY.
CHEERS!
CHEERS!
CHEERS!
CHEERS!
I'VE BEEN AN ENTREPRENEUR
ALL MY LIFE,
AND I BUILT A BUSINESS WITHOUT
THE HELP OF OTHER ENTREPRENEURS.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
MY DREAM COME TRUE
TO SURROUND MYSELF
WITH OTHER SMART PEOPLE
BUILDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS.
[ WOMAN SCREAMS, LAUGHS ]
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
FOR THIS FAMILY.
I WANT EVERYBODY
TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER,
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT,
EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE
THEIR DREAM COME TRUE.
I'M SURE OF IT.
Together:
THANK YOU, BARBARA!
WHOO!
Man: WHOO!
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK IS A RESOURCE
TO HELP CONTROL YOUR REPUTATION
IN THE AGE OF TECHNOLOGY.
HI, SHARKS.
SO, IS THE THEORY
THAT YOU COME HOME
AND YOU TAKE THE iPad OFF
AND YOU USE IT NORMALLY?
YEAH. EXACTLY.
TO ME,
THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.
BECAUSE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA HAVE AN EXTRA iPad.
I THINK THE FACT
THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE
AN EXTRA TABLET OF SOME SORT,
UM, REALLY LIMITS YOUR MARKET
TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE
OF AFFORDING THAT.
YOU KNOW, CONCEPTUALLY,
I THINK IT'S AN OKAY IDEA,
BUT I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA BE
HARD TO CONVEY IT
AND EXPENSIVE TO SELL,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPINION.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
WE ARE LOOKING TO, UH,
DROP COST,
THUS DROP -- BE ABLE
TO DROP PRICE.
SO RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A LITTLE
OVER 30% MARGIN.
30% MARGIN, THOUGH,
I THINK IS LOW.
LIKE, MOST PLACES WANT
50% OR HIGHER.
YEAH, WE AGREE.
BUT EVERYBODY
WE'VE TALKED TO SO FAR,
THEY --
THEY'RE OKAY WITH 40%.
I THINK THE CONCEPT
IS A NICE CONCEPT,
AND I DO THINK IT'S PROBABLY
MORE COMFORTING
TO THE OWNER
THAN TO THE DOG.
ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT IS WHERE I THINK
IT FALLS.
BUT I DON'T SEE IT BEING A GREAT
MARKET PRODUCT RIGHT NOW.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
O'Leary:
I HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION
ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING,
"ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART
GROW FONDER."
[ CHUCKLES ]
I THINK A LITTLE SELF TIME
FOR A DOG IS VERY IMPORTANT.
[ LAUGHS ]
MAKES HIM MISS YOU.
WHEN YOU COME HOME,
HIS TAIL IS WAGGING.
I HATE THIS VERY MUCH
AS AN IDEA.
VERY MUCH.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, KEVIN.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OPINION.
