I AM MIKAILA.
MIKAILA'S ALWAYS LOVED
BUSINESS.
EVER SINCE
SHE WAS 4 YEARS OLD,
WE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS
A NATURAL ENTREPRENEUR.
AH, THERE YOU GO.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S MIKAILA ULMER.
BRING IT ON,
MIKAILA.
SO CUTE.
WHAT FLAVOR IS THIS,
MIKAILA?
THIS IS GINGER.
Herjavec: IT'S GREAT.
Theo:
HE GETS THE ORIGINAL.
THEO, WE KNOW
ABOUT MIKAILA'S BACKGROUND,
THEO, WHERE DID YOU WORK
BEFORE THIS?
I WORKED AT XEROX,
MIKAILA, WHAT'S YOUR
BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IN YOUR BUSINESS RIGHT NOW?
NOT TO SAY THAT MIKAILA
ISN'T FANTASTIC.
BUT YOU'RE NOT COMMITTED,
MIKAILA.
YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.
MIKAILA, WE SEE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ON THE SHOW.
SOME THINGS ARE MORE COMPETITIVE
THAN OTHERS.
THE DRINK MARKET LIKE THIS
AT A STORE LEVEL,
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THEO,
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN -- MIKAILA,
YOU'RE AMAZING, RIGHT?
I MEAN,
Y-YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS,
YOU'RE NOT QUITE A COMPANY YET.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE BEST
THAT MIKAILA'S GOING TO DO.
I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S
SO MUCH BETTER AHEAD FOR HER,
SO COME BACK, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU GRADUATE
FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL.
YOU'LL PROBABLY OWN
HALF THE PLACE.
UM, BUT WE WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Greiner: YOU KNOW, MIKAILA,
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO SAY OFTEN
I CAN TELL
IF SOMETHING OR SOMEONE
IS A HERO OR A ZERO.
HERO OR A ZERO.
YOU ARE DEFINITELY A BIG HERO.
I THINK YOU'RE DOING
EVERY SINGLE THING RIGHT,
CONGRATS, MIKAILA!
THANK YOU.
Greiner: CONGRATS!
NICE JOB.
YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB.
UM, I'M REALLY EXCITED
THAT DAYMOND'S MY NEW PARTNER,
SO, IS THE THEORY
THAT YOU COME HOME
