I'M PATRICK AMBRON
FROM NEW YORK, NEW YORK,
PATRICK, IT'S AN ISSUE.
PART OF THE REASON --
JUST SO YOU GUYS
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE AS ME --
IS WE ACTUALLY
JUST RECENTLY RAISED
PART OF A ROUND
AT THIS VALUATION.
SO PART OF IT IS THE FAIRNESS.
THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET'S
PRICING AT.
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE?
WE RAISED --
WE WERE OUT RAISING $5 MILLION.
OKAY, PATRICK,
HERE'S -- HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
WE ALL HAVE TO SHRINK
OUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT,
BUT THE GROWTH SIDE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, I THINK,
IS GOING TO REACH
A ROADBLOCK
AS THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES
PATRICK, HE JUST VALUED
YOUR BUSINESS AT $8 MILLION.
HE'S THE LARGEST INVESTOR
THAT'S EVER WRITTEN A CHECK.
PAT, I'M NOT INTER--
Ambron: GUYS, I --
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
[ SIGHS ]
HEY, THAT AGE,
TO TURN DOWN 2 MILLION BUCKS --
IT TAKES GUTS.
THAT WAS A DEAL I VISUALIZED.
I WANTED IT SO BAD.
BUT AT THE END, WE JUST COULDN'T
MEET IN THE MIDDLE,
