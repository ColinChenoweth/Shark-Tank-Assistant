I'M PATRICK AMBRON
FROM NEW YORK, NEW YORK,
AND MY COMPANY IS BrandYourself.
I'M SEEKING
A $2 MILLION INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 13.5%
EQUITY STAKE...
John: [ LAUGHS ]
...IN MY COMPANY.
OH, WOW!
NICE!
SHARKS...
MEET BOB.
BOB WENT
TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL,
GRADUATED TOP OF HIS CLASS,
AND WAS EVEN PRESIDENT
OF THE DEBATE TEAM.
BOB WAS AN EMPLOYER'S DREAM,
BUT WHEN EMPLOYERS
LOOKED BOB UP ONLINE,
THEY DON'T MEET 4.0 BOB.
THEY MEET SPRING BREAK '08 BOB.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND BOB'S ONE MISTAKE
HAS BEEN COSTING HIM...
OH, MY GOD.
OH, BOB.
...DOZENS OF JOBS.
AN ONLINE SEARCH
IS NOW YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION,
AND BrandYourself HELPS ENSURE
YOU MAKE A GOOD ONE.
IT'S THE FIRST ONLINE PLATFORM
THAT HELPS PEOPLE IMPROVE
WHAT SHOWS UP
WHEN SOMEONE SEARCHES FOR THEM
ONLINE.
SO, IF AN EMPLOYER, A CLIENT,
A COLLEAGUE,
OR EVEN A DATE LOOKS THEM UP,
THEY WON'T FIND THAT
EMBARRASSING BLOG FROM COLLEGE.
INSTEAD, THEY'LL FIND
WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO FIND --
ACCURATE, RELEVANT RESULTS
ABOUT YOU.
OUR ONLINE PLATFORM IS SIMPLE.
YOU SIGN UP FOR AN ACCOUNT
AND ENTER YOUR NAME
TO GET YOUR SEARCH RESULTS.
YOU MARK THOSE RESULTS
AS EITHER POSITIVE, IRRELEVANT,
OR NEGATIVE TO GET A SCORE,
WHICH IS BASED ON
HOW GOOD YOU CURRENTLY LOOK
WHEN SOMEONE LOOKS YOU UP.
IN THIS CASE, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE COULD USE SOME HELP.
SO NEXT,
YOU SUBMIT THE RELEVANT THINGS
YOU THINK
PEOPLE SHOULD BE FINDING.
YOUR PERSONAL WEBSITE,
AN ARTICLE YOU WROTE --
ANYTHING.
OUR SOFTWARE ANALYZES THAT
AND SHOWS YOU ALL THE STEPS
YOU CAN TAKE THAT YOU HAVEN'T
THAT WILL MAKE IT
MORE SEARCH-ENGINE FRIENDLY
AND THEREFORE RANK HIGHER
FOR YOUR NAME.
NOW, YOU REPEAT THIS PROCESS
UNTIL YOUR FIRST PAGE IS FILLED
WITH RELEVANT RESULTS,
AND IRRELEVANT OR UNWANTED
RESULTS ARE BURIED FAR BELOW.
NOW, THIS IS THE SAME PROCESS
YOU USED TO HAVE TO PAY A FIRM
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
A YEAR TO DO FOR YOU.
BUT TODAY, EVERYBODY NEEDS
THE POWER AND THE TOOLS
TO PUT THEM BACK IN CONTROL
OF THEIR OWN ONLINE REPUTATIONS,
AND BrandYourself
IS THE COMPANY CREATING THOSE.
SO, SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO JOIN US?
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?
WE WANTED TO START OFF
WITH A FREE PRODUCT
SO PEOPLE WOULD COME IN
AND -- AND HELP THEMSELVES,
AND THEN A VERY INEXPENSIVE
PREMIUM VERSION,
WHICH IS STILL
ABOUT 100 BUCKS A YEAR.
OUR FREE PRODUCT
WAS ALSO BRINGING IN
PEOPLE WHO TRADITIONALLY WENT
TO OUR COMPETITORS --
HIGH-LEVEL EXECUTIVES
OR PEOPLE WITH
MORE COMPLICATED PROBLEMS --
AND WE LAUNCHED
A CONCIERGE SERVICE
FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT.
HOW MANY PEOPLE SIGNED UP?
WE HAVE 300,000 FREE USERS,
OVER 5,000 SUBSCRIBERS,
AND CONCIERGE, WHICH IS NEW,
WHICH IS ABOUT A YEAR OLD,
UH, A LITTLE -- AROUND 500.
SO, CONCIERGE GETS YOU
AN ACTIVE HUMAN BEING...
YEP. A TEAM.
...WHO IS WORKING
WITH YOU --
YEAH. MM-HMM.
A TEAM OF PEOPLE.
WHAT'S THE PRICE
FOR THE CONCIERGE SERVICE?
THE AVERAGE FIRST-YEAR CONTRACT
IS ABOUT $5,000.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
SO, SINCE MARCH OF 2012,
WE'VE DONE, UH, $2.2 MILLION
WITH ANOTHER $500,000
IN BOOKED CONTRACTS.
OH.
OH, WOW.
BUT THE GROWTH
IS EVEN CRAZIER.
OKAY.
SO, $400,000 OUR FIRST YEAR.
100% GROWTH THE NEXT YEAR
TO $800,000.
THIS YEAR, WE'VE ALREADY
SURPASSED WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR.
WE'RE ON PACE PROBABLY
TO BREAK OVER $2 MILLION.
WHAT DO YOU DO
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS
THAT DON'T MAKE IT
INTO GOOGLE?
THAT'S A SEPARATE TOOL SET
WE'RE WORKING ON
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
UNDER THE UMBRELLA
OF THE BUSINESS --
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY.
UH, WE DON'T HAVE IT
LAUNCHED TODAY, NO.
I CAN BUY THAT, AND I HAVE,
FOR $10,000 TO $15,000, OKAY?
MM-HMM.
CONCIERGE SERVICE
THAT IS WORKING THEIR WAY
THROUGH THE ISSUES
AROUND THESE BUSINESSES.
SURE.
AND SOMETIMES
IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.
YOU'RE RIGHT
IN THE SENSE NO MATTER WHAT,
THERE'S NO GUARANTEED RESULT.
SO YOU'RE
THE LOW-COST PROVIDER
IN AN INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY HAS
FOUR OR FIVE COMPETITORS.
IT'S NOT JUST A PRICE.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE SERVICE.
THERE'S A REASON WHY
THE BIG GUYS TRASH-TALK US.
THEY HATE US BECAUSE WE'RE
TAKING ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS
'CAUSE WE DO IT BETTER.
UH, WE'RE THE BEST COMPANY
IN THIS INDUSTRY.
WE'VE GOT THE BEST PEOPLE,
THE BEST TECHNOLOGY.
YEAH, BUT, PAT,
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE PROBLEM --
BETTER IS NOT
A DIFFERENTIATOR.
YOU MAY BE SMARTER, FASTER,
LEANER, MEANER,
AND HAVE A BETTER MODEL,
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOUR VALUATION
IS 15 MILLION BUCKS.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
WRONG WITH YOUR BUSINESS.
I DON'T THINK I WOULD PAY
A $15 MILLION VALUATION FOR IT.
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT
GET A CUSTOMER OUT OF IT,
AND I HOPE YOUR CLAIMS
ARE RIGHT.
I HOPE YOU DO
GET A CUSTOMER OUT OF IT
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH,
AND WE'LL DO A MUCH BETTER JOB.
I'M OUT.
SO, I THINK THIS IS VALUABLE,
IT'S MUCH NEEDED,
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE COME
TO WORK FOR ME,
WE JUST LOOK 'EM UP.
RIGHT?
YEP.
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.
HERE'S THE BAD NEWS.
I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT THE SPACE
TO RISK $2 MILLION
OF MY OWN MONEY.
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I APPRECIATE IT.
SO, THE VALUATION IS OBVIOUSLY
PROBABLY GOING TO BE AN ISSUE,
RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
I-I-I UNDERSTAND I'M ASKING --
PATRICK, IT'S AN ISSUE.
PART OF THE REASON --
JUST SO YOU GUYS
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE AS ME --
IS WE ACTUALLY
JUST RECENTLY RAISED
PART OF A ROUND
AT THIS VALUATION.
SO PART OF IT IS THE FAIRNESS.
THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET'S
PRICING AT.
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE?
WE RAISED --
WE WERE OUT RAISING $5 MILLION.
WE CLOSED $3 MILLION AND WANTED
TO LEAVE THE EXTRA $2 MILLION --
SO YOU CLOSED
$3 MILLION...
YES.
...AT ROUGHLY
A $15 MILLION VALUATION.
UH, YES.
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A HUSTLER.
I LIKE THAT.
THANK YOU.
I HEAR THE ADS ALL THE TIME
FOR WHAT WE KEEP SAYING IS
YOUR MAJOR COMPETITION.
THEY ARE SPENDING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING.
WHILE I THINK
IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT,
I THINK THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MILLIONS
IN ADVERTISING
TO BE ABLE TO BEAT THEM.
I'M OUT.
I-I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
THE FEEDBACK.
OKAY, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
ROBERT AND MR. CUBAN.
TWO TECH GUYS.
OKAY, PATRICK,
HERE'S -- HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
WE ALL HAVE TO SHRINK
OUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT,
BUT THE GROWTH SIDE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, I THINK,
IS GOING TO REACH
A ROADBLOCK
AS THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES
AND THE DEPENDENCY
ON SOCIAL MEDIA GROWS.
YET YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM,
BUT YOU'RE PRICING AS IF
YOU HAVE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM.
AND BECAUSE
OF THAT DISCONNECT,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
ROBERT?
MR. HERJAVEC, MR. SECURITY GUY.
PAT, I LIKE IT.
YOU KNOW, I -- I THINK
THAT, UH, THERE'S DEFINITELY
A BUSINESS HERE.
YEP.
I THINK THERE'S
A VERY LARGE BUSINESS
FOR CONSUMERS THAT MAY NOT
BE COMPUTER SAVVY,
THAT WANT A BETTER REPUTATION
OR GET RID OF SOMETHING.
YOUR REAL VALUE
IS YOUR GROWTH.
YEAH.
BUT THE VALUATION IS NUTS.
I MEAN, IT'S --
IT'S JUST NUTS.
I HEAR -- I HEAR YOU.
WHAT -- WHAT WOULD --
I MEAN, IT'S $15 MILLION,
$16 MILLION AT THIS POINT,
WHERE YOU'RE DOING A COUPLE
MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES.
BUT HERE'S THE BEAUTY
OF "SHARK TANK."
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO ASK
FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT.
YEP.
RIGHT?
YES.
AS A SHARK, I'M ALLOWED
TO OFFER WHATEVER I WANT.
HERE'S AN OFFER I FEEL
VERY COMFORTABLE WITH.
OKAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $2 MILLION
FOR 25%.
$2 MILLION, 25%.
$2 MILLION, 25%.
WHAT IF WE DID SOMETHING --
BECAUSE OUT OF FAIRNESS
TO INVESTORS --
I AM A LITTLE BIT MORE LOCKED IN
BECAUSE OF FAIRNESS
OF WHAT WE'VE JUST CLOSED ON.
LOOK, I BELIEVE IN IT.
I THINK YOU'RE
A REALLY SMART GUY.
I THINK YOU'RE DOING IT.
I ALSO BELIEVE IT'S RISKY.
WE'LL DO $10 MILLION,
$15 MILLION BY 2015,
WHERE YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
YOUR MONEY BACK --
PATRICK, HE JUST VALUED
YOUR BUSINESS AT $8 MILLION.
HE'S THE LARGEST INVESTOR
THAT'S EVER WRITTEN A CHECK.
PAT, I'M NOT INTER--
PAT, I AM NO --
AND HE'S A SHARK.
I LOVE IT WHEN HE DOES
MY TALKING FOR ME.
PAT,
I DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST --
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.
CAN I --
BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST
IN GETTING MY MONEY BACK
THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR.
THIS IS YOU'RE EITHER
GONNA SCALE IT
TO $50 MILLION OR $100 MILLION
OR YOU'RE NOT.
DO YOU MIND
IF I GIVE SOMEONE A CALL
AND -- AND THINK ABOUT IT
FOR A SECOND?
I THINK
BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING IN BETWEEN.
I'M NOT GONNA WASTE
YOUR TIME.
I'M NOT
GONNA NEGOTIATE DOWN.
IT'S $2 MILLION FOR 25%.
YOU KNOW, ROBERT,
FOR 2 MILLION BUCKS,
IF YOU LIKE THIS BUSINESS
SO MUCH, JUST DO IT YOURSELF.
[ LAUGHS ]
HE COULD TRY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
$2 MILLION, 25% --
I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.
BUT THAT $2 MILLION WOULD GO
A VERY LONG WAY.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE --
O'Leary: DON'T WORRY.
OF COURSE.
IT'LL GO A LONG WAY
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
WHO'S GONNA GET IT
RIGHT AFTER YOU LEAVE.
I KNOW.
SO TURN AROUND, PLEASE.
TIME TO GIVE IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.
ALL RIGHT. WELL --
O'Leary: THANK YOU FOR COMING.
Ambron: GUYS, I --
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
[ SIGHS ]
HEY, THAT AGE,
TO TURN DOWN 2 MILLION BUCKS --
IT TAKES GUTS.
THAT WAS A DEAL I VISUALIZED.
I WANTED IT SO BAD.
BUT AT THE END, WE JUST COULDN'T
MEET IN THE MIDDLE,
AND I -- YOU KNOW,
SAYING NO WAS HARD,
BUT I-IT'S JUST WHAT I HAD
TO DO.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A HIGH-TECH WAY
TO HELP YOU FEEL CONNECTED
TO YOUR PETS.
