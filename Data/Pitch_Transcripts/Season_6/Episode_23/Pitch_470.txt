SHARKS, MY NAME IS RYAN SHELL,
AND I NOW LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY.
I'M THE FOUNDER OF THE HOME T,
Shell: DO ME A FAVOR.
THINK ABOUT HOME
FOR JUST A SECOND.
Shell: THERE'S ILLINOIS
RIGHT THERE.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: LOOK AT THAT!
THANK YOU.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
Greiner:
WHAT'S YOURS, KEVIN?
MASSACHUSETTS.
Herjavec: RYAN, YOU HAVE
A T-SHIRT COMPANY
YOU'RE SAYING IS WORTH
$5 MILLION.
YES, SIR.
WHY IS IT WORTH
$5 MILLION?
SO, IN OUR FIRST 12 MONTHS,
WE DID $1.1 MILLION IN REVENUE.
WELL,
YOU JUST SHUT ME UP.
WHAT'D YOU MAKE ON THAT?
$540,000.
THAT'S AMAZING.
HOW MANY PEOPLE
IN THE BUSINESS?
UH, RIGHT NOW,
IT IS JUST ME.
WOW.
Herjavec: HOW MUCH DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR, RYAN?
SO, THE CREW NECK THAT
YOU'RE HOLDING IS $30.
Greiner:
SO, I HAVE A QUESTION.
I MEAN, I KNOW IT--
IT'S A SOFT T-SHIRT.
I GET THE COMFORTS OF HOME,
OR PEOPLE SAYING,
"WHOO-HOO, TEXAS," OR WHATEVER.
RIGHT.
WHY DO YOU THINK...
WHOO-HOO!
...THAT THIS HAS DONE
SO AMAZINGLY WELL?
I THINK EVERYONE CAN CONNECT
WITH HOME.
OR ARE YOU JUST GREAT
AT P.R.?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Shell:
FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT,
WE DID START
WITH A LOT OF DIGITAL,
CAN I TAKE $5 MILLION,
GO HIRE ANOTHER RYAN,
RYAN, THE DIFFERENCE IS
THAT'S $5 MILLION TO RISK.
RIGHT.
YOU'RE PROFITABLE.
YOU'VE REDUCED THE RISK.
IT TAKES NOTHING
TO SET THIS UP!
SO YOU'RE WAY AHEAD.
IT TAKES YOU $5 MILLION.
NOTHING!
WHEN YOU CAME OUT, RYAN,
HONESTLY, I THOUGHT,
"T-SHIRT WITH A COOL LOGO."
MM-HMM.
"IT'S INTERESTING."
NOT IN MY WILDEST DREAMS
DID I THINK YOU'D
BE MAKING $1 MILLION.
LOOK, I DIDN'T, EITHER.
PEOPLE LIKE BRYAN CRANSTON
HAVE WORN THE PRODUCT,
WHICH IS,
I MEAN, SUPER COOL, RIGHT?
YOU JUST PUT IT
ON YOUR WEBSITE?
Shell: CORRECT.
NOW, WE DID GET LUCKY
WITH HILARY DUFF.
SHE WORE THE SHIRT.
LISTEN, RYAN, I-I-I'LL HELP
EVERYBODY OUT HERE.
T-SHIRTS ARE A COMMODITY,
OKAY?
THEY'RE JUST
A TOTAL COMMODITY.
WOW, RYAN!
[ LAUGHS ]
O'Leary:
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE --
AND, REALLY, RYAN, I --
CONGRATULATIONS.
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
A GREAT JOB.
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.
RYAN.
RYAN, THAT'S GREAT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT
A LONG-TERM COMPANY.
RYAN, YOUR COMPANY'S ON FIRE.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU'RE KILLING IT.
YOUR SALES ARE REMARKABLE
FOR A T-SHIRT.
BUT THERE IS A LOT AT RISK
IN THE CLOTHING BUSINESS.
IT'S GONNA DIP.
RYAN, YOU CAME OUT
LOOKING FOR 5%.
YOU,
BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION --
O'Leary: RYAN.
Greiner: BUT YOU SAID
THAT YOU --
IT WAS A STARTING POINT --
YOU DON'T WALK OUT HERE
TO BE STUPID.
O'Leary: YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
YOU'RE SMART, RYAN.
STICK TO YOUR GUNS.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
DON'T TURN STUPID ON US,
RYAN.
FOCUS ON THOSE.
NOW YOU FOUND OUT
THE REAL MARKET VALUE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S THE REAL MARKET VALUE,
I'M JUST OPENING THE DOOR.
Herjavec: RYAN. RYAN.
RYAN, YOU HAVE AN OFFER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'M SORRY.
I CA-- I-I WOULD LOVE
TO PARTNER WITH YOU,
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO THAT MUCH.
WHAT'S YOUR COUNTER?
RYAN, I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 20%.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
O'Leary: OKAY.
PHEW.
RYAN, I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 20%.
I'M -- I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST --
YOU DIDN'T WANT A DEAL THEN,
LIKE I THOUGHT.
Cuban: YEAH, HE DID.
SEE, I DON'T AGREE
WITH THAT, RYAN.
DON'T -- DON'T -- DON'T GET
BUMMED OUT ABOUT THAT.
ENOUGH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT OFFER?
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
THANK YOU. WELL, I HOPE
YOU ENJOY YOUR T-SHIRTS.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, RYAN.
CONGRATULATIONS, RYAN.
GOOD LUCK.
THAT WAS WEIRD, DAYMOND.
NO, IT'S NOT.
HE'S NOT THAT STUPID.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
YOU DON'T SELL
A MILLION DOLLARS IN EARNING
IN THE CURRENT YEAR
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
THAT MILLION DOLLARS
IS PAPER THIN -- PAPER THIN.
BUT IT'S STILL SPENDABLE.
PAPER THIN.
TOTAL COMMODITY.
IT'S A T-SHIRT.
Shell: THAT WENT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN I THOUGHT.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE COME IN
AT HIGHER THAN 5%.
MAYBE I JUST COMPLETELY
SCREWED THAT UP.
I-I DON'T KNOW.
