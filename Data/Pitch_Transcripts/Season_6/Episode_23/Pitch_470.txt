HI, SHARKS.
I'M JAMES PELLAND.
AND I'M BROOKE MARTIN.
AND THIS IS OUR FRIEND YOYO.
WE'RE ASKING YOU FOR
A $150,000 INVESTMENT
IN RETURN FOR 20%
IN OUR COMPANY, iCPooch.
iCPooch IS MERGING
THE TECH INDUSTRY
WITH THE PET INDUSTRY.
MY FAMILY DOG SUFFERED
FROM SEPARATION ANXIETY
WHENEVER WE LEFT HER ALONE
AT HOME.
SHE WOULD OFTEN BE DEPRESSED
OR EVEN DESTRUCTIVE,
AND IT WAS SO HEARTBREAKING
TO SEE HER SUFFER.
I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH,
AND I FOUND OUT THAT
CANINE SEPARATION ANXIETY
IS A COMMON PROBLEM
THAT AFFECTS
MORE THAN 10 MILLION DOGS
IN THE U.S. ALONE.
I THOUGHT IT'D BE GREAT
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO CHECK IN
ON MY DOG REMOTELY,
EASE HER LONELINESS,
AND MAYBE EVEN GIVE HER A TREAT.
SO I CREATED iCPooch,
A DEVICE THAT LETS YOU
TWO-WAY VIDEO CHAT WITH YOUR DOG
AND DELIVER THEM A TREAT
FROM ANYWHERE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
iCPooch IS EASY
TO SET UP.
JUST DOWNLOAD OUR FREE APP ON
YOUR SMARTPHONE OR SMART TABLET,
CONNECT iCPooch TO WI-FI,
YOU PLACE A DEVICE
ON THE FRONT OF iCPooch,
AND THEN SET IT IN
A CONVENIENT PLACE FOR YOUR PET.
YOYO'S OWNER, GLEN,
IS SO PROUD
THAT SHE GETS TO BE HERE TODAY
PITCHING
IN FRONT OF YOU SHARKS,
BUT HE MISSES YOYO TERRIBLY
AND WANTS TO CHECK IN
TO SEE HOW SHE'S DOING
HERE IN THE TANK.
ALL GLEN HAS TO DO IS LAUNCH
THE iCPooch APP ON HIS PHONE,
AND GLEN CAN SEE
AND SPEAK TO YOYO,
AND HIS FACE AND VOICE OFFERS
A CALMING REMINDER
THAT YOYO IS LOVED
AND MISSED.
[ LAUGHS ]
Hi, Yoyo.
COME SAY HI.
SETTLE.
SETTLE.
Are you being a good girl
for the sharks?
IF HE WANTS TO SHOW
EVEN MORE LOVE,
HE CAN SIMPLY PRESS A BUTTON
AND iCPooch DISPENSES A TREAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
iCPooch IS THE NEXT BEST THING
TO ACTUALLY BEING WITH YOUR DOG.
SO, SHARKS,
WHICH ONE OF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO HELP REVOLUTIONIZE
THE WAY
WE INTERACT
WITH OUR BEST FRIENDS?
Greiner:
[ CHUCKLES ]
Herjavec: JAMES, WE HAVE VIDEO
CONFERENCING IN OUR BUSINESS.
I CAN'T GET HUMANS
TO USE VIDEO CONFERENCING
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT DOGS,
ON A CONSISTENT BASIS,
ARE GONNA DO THAT?
WELL,
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
I WAS INVITED
TO A CONFERENCE
BY THE AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL
DOG TRAINERS ASSOCIATION,
AND ACTUALLY
A LOT OF DOG TRAINERS
ARE USING SKYPE TECHNOLOGIES
TO TRAIN DOGS.
WITHOUT A HUMAN PRESENCE,
THEY'RE ABLE TO --
BUT HOW DO I GET THE DOG TO SIT
AT THE KEYBOARD AND TYPE?
[ LAUGHTER ]
SKYPING TO THE DOGS, HUH?
IS YOUR PRODUCT JUST THE CASE?
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY
THAT'S A STANDARD TABLET.
THAT'S CORRECT.
AND WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S $149 RETAIL.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
$60.
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY?
YES.
WE JUST STARTED SHIPPING PRODUCT
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.
WE'VE SOLD SO FAR
ABOUT 115 UNITS.
115,000?
NO, 115 UNITS.
115.
MY GRAVEST CONCERN IS
YOU'RE INTRODUCING SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE A FIRE HYDRANT
RIGHT INTO SOMEBODY'S KITCHEN.
Cuban: [ LAUGHS ]
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHAT THE OUTCOME'S GONNA BE.
THAT'S A GREAT POINT,
KEVIN.
IT IS A GOOD POINT.
IT IS A GOOD POINT.
O'Leary:
WHAT STOPS POOCHY FROM SAYING,
"I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE OUTSIDE.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO
ON MY OWNER'S FACE"?
Greiner: [ LAUGHS ]
SO, I HAVE A QUESTION.
HOW DID THE TWO OF YOU
COME UP WITH IT?
I CREATED THIS 12 --
WHEN I WAS 12.
I'M 14 NOW. UM --
WOW.
YOU'RE ONLY 14?
YES.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WOW.
I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA,
AND I PITCHED IT AT AN EVENT
CALLED STARTUP WEEKEND,
AND SO IT WAS ME AND 39
OTHER ADULTS THAT HAD PITCHED,
AND I ENDED UP GETTING
THE MOST NUMBER OF VOTES,
SO I GOT TO WORK
WITH A TEAM OF PEOPLE --
DEVELOPERS, DESIGNERS.
WE THINK THAT DOGS
HAVE A LOT OF,
YOU KNOW, ANXIETY
WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE AWAY,
AND THE OWNERS DO, TOO,
YOU KNOW?
THEY MISS THEIR DOGS
WHEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE
TO BE WITH THEM.
IS JAMES YOUR DAD,
BROOKE?
NO.
JAMES -- SO, WE MET JAMES,
UM, THROUGH SCHOOL.
HE -- HIS KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH ME AND MY LITTLE SISTER.
AND, SO, WE GOT TO KNOW HIM,
AND WITH HIS BACKGROUND --
AND WE BROUGHT HIM ON BOARD
AS THE C.E.O.
SO, JAMES,
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
I SPENT 11 YEARS
IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY
BETWEEN ASUS COMPUTERS,
DELL COMPUTERS,
AND GENERAL DYNAMICS.
IS THIS
YOUR FULL-TIME JOB NOW
OR ARE YOU STILL WORKING
FOR OTHER COMPANIES?
YES, IT IS. YES.
I LEFT ASUS TO COME DO THIS.
JAMES, HOW MUCH ARE YOU PAYING
YOURSELF TO RUN THE COMPANY?
NOTHING.
GOOD. OKAY.
PART OF WHAT WE HOPE
TO DO IS -- IS GET, UM,
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD
WITH, UH, DESIGN.
HOWEVER, IN TERMS OF
THE FIRE HYDRANT,
WE HAVEN'T HAD
ANY REPORTS OF THAT,
AND NONE OF THE DOGS
WE'VE TESTED WITH
HAVE EVER DONE THAT.
ARE YOU IN RETAILERS ANYWHERE?
WE'RE ON AMAZON.
WE ARE ABOUT TO SHIP
OUR FIRST SHIPMENT,
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT P.O. IS FOR YET,
TO BED BATH &amp; BEYOND.
MM-HMM.
'CAUSE THEY'RE DOING
A PET TECH SORT OF THING,
AND THEY'RE DOING A TEST
IN ABOUT NINE STORES.
AND THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY UNITS
THEY WERE GOING TO ORDER?
NO, THEY DIDN'T.
CAN WE SEE THE PRODUCT?
I WAS CURIOUS...
Herjavec: YOYO.
...'CAUSE YOU CALLED
THE DOG OVER.
[ SMOOCHES ]
THE DOG DIDN'T GO TO GLEN.
COME HERE.
DID YOU NOTICE THAT?
COME ON!
THE DOG --
THE HARD PART
ABOUT THIS IS
THERE'S SO MANY DISTRACTIONS
IN THIS SETTING.
Herjavec:
SHOW ME WHERE IT GETS --
THE TREAT COMES OUT
THE FRONT HERE.
AND HOW DOES THE TREAT
GET RELEASED?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A PEZ DISPENSER.
BASICALLY,
YOU STACK THE TREATS INSIDE.
OH, I SEE.
AND IT SWIPES THE BOTTOM ONE
OUT INTO THE TRAY,
AND THEN
THEY JUST FALL DOWN.
SEE, BROOKE, THE GREAT THING
ABOUT KEVIN IS
HE'S MEAN TO ADULTS
AND CHILDREN THE SAME WAY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I APPLAUD YOU.
AT YOUR AGE,
COMPETING AGAINST ADULTS
AND ACTUALLY WIN A COMPETITION
LIKE THAT.
BUT, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU LAUNCH A PRODUCT LIKE THAT,
JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT
THE MARKET'S GONNA ACCEPT IT.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SALES
WHERE I CAN COUNT ON THAT.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I DON'T KNOW
IF SOMETHING'S GONNA WORK,
I LIKE TO RELY ON SALES,
AND YOU CAN PROVE ME WRONG.
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE DONE THAT.
I'M OUT.
John: I DON'T THINK
IT'S TESTED ENOUGH,
AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT,
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
DOGS SLEEP 95% OF THE TIME
THAT THE OWNER'S NOT THERE,
AND I THINK THAT
IT'S GONNA CREATE MORE ANXIETY
HOPING THAT OWNER COMES
ONTO THAT SCREEN.
UM, I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S,
YOU KNOW,
ENOUGH PROOF RIGHT THERE
WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT.
SO, UM, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
Pelland: THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS, THOUGH,
IS YOU'RE 14 YEARS OLD,
AND YOU'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF
ONE PRETTY CLEVER ITEM.
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
IN THE NEXT DOZEN YEARS.
BROOKE, AT THIS PACE, YOU'LL BE
THE QUEEN OF QVC IN FOUR YEARS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
John: THANKS A LOT.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
COME ON, YOYO.
[ DOG BARKING ]
COME ON, YOYO.
Martin: YOU KNOW, THE SHARKS
MISSED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO INVEST IN iCPooch,
BUT I KNOW THE NEXT TIME
THAT THEY'RE MISSING THEIR PETS,
THEY'RE GONNA WANT
TO BE A CUSTOMER, FOR SURE.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A PRODUCT DESIGNED
TO HELP DECLARE YOUR HOME PRIDE.
