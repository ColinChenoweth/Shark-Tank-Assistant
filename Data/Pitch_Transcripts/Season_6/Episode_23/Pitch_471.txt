SHARKS, MY NAME IS RYAN SHELL,
AND I NOW LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY.
I'M THE FOUNDER OF THE HOME T,
AND I'M HERE TODAY
ASKING FOR $250,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
[ LAUGHS ]
Shell: DO ME A FAVOR.
THINK ABOUT HOME
FOR JUST A SECOND.
IT'S A PLACE YOU KNOW
LIKE THE BACK OF YOUR HAND.
IT'S A COMFORTABLE PLACE
WHERE MEMORIES ARE MADE.
AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE NOT
ALWAYS LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY,
AND I'VE BECOME ALL TOO FAMILIAR
WITH WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO MISS HOME.
I MISS THE PEOPLE, THE ACCENTS,
THE SWEET TEA,
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON THE BARBECUE.
SIMPLY PUT, HOME IS A PLACE
THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY,
AND WHEN I'M IN NEW YORK CITY,
IT SEEMS LIKE ALMOST DAILY
I'LL BE WALKING AROUND,
MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS,
AND THEN OUT OF THE BLUE I HEAR,
"WHOO-HOO, TEXAS!"
AND I LOOK UP,
AND SOMEONE HAS SPOTTED
THE TEXAS HOME T
THAT I'M WEARING.
AND YOU CAN SEE THEM SMILING
FROM EAR TO EAR.
THE HOME T IS MADE IN THE USA,
AND WE'RE EXTREMELY PROUD
TO DONATE A PORTION OF PROFIT
TO CHARITY.
THE BRAND IS ENJOYED
BY CUSTOMERS
ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES
AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.
AND I BROUGHT A PIECE OF HOME
HERE FOR YOU TODAY.
I HAVE A LITTLE CROATIA
FOR YOU RIGHT HERE.
OH.
WELL, I LIKE IT NOW.
Shell: THERE'S ILLINOIS
RIGHT THERE.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: LOOK AT THAT!
THANK YOU.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
Greiner:
WHAT'S YOURS, KEVIN?
MASSACHUSETTS.
Herjavec: RYAN, YOU HAVE
A T-SHIRT COMPANY
YOU'RE SAYING IS WORTH
$5 MILLION.
YES, SIR.
WHY IS IT WORTH
$5 MILLION?
SO, IN OUR FIRST 12 MONTHS,
WE DID $1.1 MILLION IN REVENUE.
WELL,
YOU JUST SHUT ME UP.
WHAT'D YOU MAKE ON THAT?
$540,000.
THAT'S AMAZING.
HOW MANY PEOPLE
IN THE BUSINESS?
UH, RIGHT NOW,
IT IS JUST ME.
WOW.
Herjavec: HOW MUCH DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR, RYAN?
SO, THE CREW NECK THAT
YOU'RE HOLDING IS $30.
Greiner:
SO, I HAVE A QUESTION.
I MEAN, I KNOW IT--
IT'S A SOFT T-SHIRT.
I GET THE COMFORTS OF HOME,
OR PEOPLE SAYING,
"WHOO-HOO, TEXAS," OR WHATEVER.
RIGHT.
WHY DO YOU THINK...
WHOO-HOO!
...THAT THIS HAS DONE
SO AMAZINGLY WELL?
I THINK EVERYONE CAN CONNECT
WITH HOME.
OR ARE YOU JUST GREAT
AT P.R.?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Shell:
FROM A MARKETING STANDPOINT,
WE DID START
WITH A LOT OF DIGITAL,
AND, UH, MARKETING
IS MY BACKGROUND --
MARKETING
AND PUBLIC RELATIONS.
THERE YOU GO.
LET'S GET TO THAT STUFF.
AND THE LAST "JOB" I HAD
WAS AT A MAJOR AGENCY
IN -- IN NEW YORK CITY.
I MEAN, I'LL HAVE TO SAY
THAT I THINK
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
AN ENTREPRENEUR AT HEART
WHEN I WOULD SAY
I GREW UP
IN WHAT WOULD BE CATEGORIZED AS
A LOW-MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY.
WHERE'D YOU GROW UP?
NORTH CAROLINA.
WHY IS TEXAS HOME?
IT'S OUR NUMBER-ONE
SELLING PRODUCT...
THERE YOU GO.
...AND I CONSTANTLY SELL
THIS SHIRT.
SO YOU'RE A FANTASTIC SALESMAN,
YOU'RE A GREAT MARKETER.
NOW I ASK MYSELF A QUESTION
THAT WE ALWAYS DEAL WITH
ON "SHARK TANK"
WHEN A COMMODITY
COMES FORWARD --
MM-HMM.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PROTECT
ANY OF THIS.
SO I ASK MYSELF, "IF I REALLY
WANT TO COMPETE WITH YOU,
CAN I TAKE $5 MILLION,
GO HIRE ANOTHER RYAN,
AND SAY, 'LISTEN, GUY,
LET'S GO OUT THERE
AND KNOCK THIS OFF,
BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY
TO DO IT.'"
YOU'RE NOT WORTH $5 MILLION.
YOU CAN'T PROTECT ANY OF IT.
I'M ABSOLUTELY WORTH
$5 MILLION.
WHY?
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE BRAND, KEVIN.
YOU CAN CREATE --
WHAT BRAND?
WHAT BRAND?
THE HOME T.
YOU MIGHT -- IT MIGHT --
WHY CAN'T I CALL IT
"THE MR. WONDERFUL HOME T"?
WAIT, STOP, STOP.
STOP!
RYAN, THE DIFFERENCE IS
THAT'S $5 MILLION TO RISK.
RIGHT.
YOU'RE PROFITABLE.
YOU'VE REDUCED THE RISK.
IT TAKES NOTHING
TO SET THIS UP!
SO YOU'RE WAY AHEAD.
IT TAKES YOU $5 MILLION.
NOTHING!
THE HOME T
IS A TRADEMARKED BRAND.
YOU CANNOT -- YOU CANNOT
PROTECT ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
WHEN YOU CAME OUT, RYAN,
HONESTLY, I THOUGHT,
"T-SHIRT WITH A COOL LOGO."
MM-HMM.
"IT'S INTERESTING."
NOT IN MY WILDEST DREAMS
DID I THINK YOU'D
BE MAKING $1 MILLION.
LOOK, I DIDN'T, EITHER.
HOW -- HOW ARE YOU KILLING IT?
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT.
SO, WORD OF MOUTH MARKETING
HAS BEEN MASSIVE FOR US WHEN --
HOW DID YOU
GET THAT STARTED?
YEAH, WHAT KIND OF
WORD OF MOUTH?
IT LITERALLY STARTED WITH,
YOU KNOW, YOU SELL A FEW SHIRTS,
AND THEN YOU BUY CROATIA,
AND THEN YOU PUT IT ON FACEBOOK,
AND THEN YOUR FRIENDS --
SO, BY PEOPLE SEEING IT?
SO, PEOPLE SEE IT --
SO IT'S JUST
A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT.
IT HAS BEEN 100% GRASSROOTS.
WE'VE USED FACEBOOK
VERY EFFECTIVELY.
I KNOW, MARK, YOU MIGHT NOT --
HOW MANY LIKES
DO YOU HAVE ON FACEBOOK?
WE HAVE 56,000 LIKES
ON FACEBOOK.
SO, WHAT I USE THAT AUDIENCE FOR
IS NOT TO SAY,
"HEY, I'VE GOT
A BIG FACEBOOK AUDIENCE!"
RIGHT.
IT'S TO SAY,
"HERE'S A NEW PRODUCT."
I CAN ADVERTISE
DIRECTLY TO THAT GROUP.
RIGHT, BUT YOU
HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT.
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH
DID YOU SPEND LAST YEAR
ON FACEBOOK ADVERTISING?
UH, I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY
LESS THAN $5,000.
WOW.
WOW.
WE HAVE TWO ADS RIGHT NOW...
THAT'S NOT MUCH.
THAT ARE CONVERTING
FOR LESS THAN $5 AN AD.
OKAY,
SO THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
BUT I-I'M STILL NOT BUYING
THAT WORD OF MOUTH...
YEAH, I'M NOT
BUYING IT, EITHER.
...AND FACEBOOK ADS ARE IT.
BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED
A LOT ABOUT P.R.
YOU'RE FROM AN AGENCY.
RIGHT.
SO, IN ADDITION TO
THE WORD OF MOUTH,
WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE
WITH CELEBRITIES.
PEOPLE LIKE BRYAN CRANSTON
HAVE WORN THE PRODUCT,
WHICH IS,
I MEAN, SUPER COOL, RIGHT?
WELL, THAT'S HUGE.
AND HOW DO YOU
CONVERT THAT TO AN IMAGE?
YOU JUST PUT IT
ON YOUR WEBSITE?
Shell: CORRECT.
NOW, WE DID GET LUCKY
WITH HILARY DUFF.
SHE WORE THE SHIRT.
SO WHAT WAS YOUR BUMP IN SALES
FROM THAT?
WE TOTALED -- IT WAS MORE THAN
$200,000 IN REVENUE THAT MONTH.
OKAY.
ARE YOU SELLING
ALMOST ALL ONLINE
OR ARE YOU SELLING
THROUGH RETAILERS?
WE SELL A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
DIRECTLY VIA OUR WEBSITE.
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAVE BAGS...
RIGHT.
...YOU HAVE HATS.
IS THAT A PILLOW?
YES.
WE SELL THE HATS,
WE'VE GOT THE TOTE BAGS.
HOW MUCH OF THE NON-T-SHIRT
STUFF DO YOU SELL?
COLLECTIVELY LESS THAN 10%.
THIS YEAR, YOU MADE $1 MILLION.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
I NEED TO HIRE SOME PEOPLE.
FIRST OFF, ON THE 5% --
THAT IS A STARTING POINT
FOR A NEGOTIATION.
I KNOW YOU GUYS
JUST LOVE 5%, SO --
NO, WE ACTUALLY HATE IT.
YEAH, NO, I-I TOTALLY KNOW.
UM, YOU'RE A VERY
SMART GUY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN US
TAKE A DEAL FOR 5%?
AS I SAID,
5% WAS A STARTING POINT,
AND WE CAN MOVE FROM THERE
IF NEED BE.
O'Leary: [ LAUGHS ]
LISTEN, RYAN, I-I-I'LL HELP
EVERYBODY OUT HERE.
T-SHIRTS ARE A COMMODITY,
OKAY?
THEY'RE JUST
A TOTAL COMMODITY.
YOU ARE A BRILLIANT MARKETER.
I'M GONNA HAND YOU THAT.
BRILLIANT.
AND AN EVEN BETTER
SALESPERSON.
BUT TO ME, THERE IS NO CHANCE
IN T-SHIRT HELL
THAT THIS IS WORTH
$5 MILLION,
BECAUSE EVEN THE EXISTING
ONLINE PLAYERS,
OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY,
CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT,
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO STOP THEM.
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU HAVEN'T DONE
A GREAT JOB IN CREATING
DEMAND FOR THIS,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT IT,
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING PROTECTABLE.
NO WAY IN HELL
IT'S WORTH 5 MILLION BUCKS.
SIR, YOU'RE WEARING A SUIT.
I'M SELLING T-SHIRTS.
I WEAR T-SHIRTS
ALL WEEKEND LONG.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
IN A T-SHIRT.
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU PLAY IN THE CIRCLE.
OH!
HE JUST DISSED YOU.
WOW, RYAN!
[ LAUGHS ]
O'Leary:
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE --
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN BE BRAVADO
AND SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE --
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
$250,000 FOR 5%,
BECAUSE I LIVE
ON THE PLANET EARTH,
AND I KNOW WHAT
A T-SHIRT COMPANY'S WORTH.
I'M OUT.
John:
COMING IN HERE, 5% --
YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT A DEAL,
I DON'T BELIEVE.
I ABSOLUTELY WANTED A DEAL,
AND AS I STATED,
IT IS A STARTING POINT.
THEN WHY NOT ASK
FOR A REALISTIC AMOUNT?
NO, HE -- HE CAME IN AND SAID
HE'S GONNA NEGOTIATE.
THAT'S FAIR.
I WAS VERY OPEN WITH THAT.
AS OPPOSED TO SAYING
HE'S NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE.
SO, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
WHAT WOULD YOU GO UP?
I THINK 10%, 15%
IS SOMETHING THAT I FEEL
PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH,
AND BEYOND THAT,
I THINK IT'S JUST NEGOTIATION.
OKAY, SO, I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU WANT A DEAL, AND, UM...
IT'S JUST MY GUT FEELING.
I'M OUT.
I'M SITTING HERE
TELLING YOU GUYS
I GENUINELY WOULD LOVE A DEAL.
YOU KNOW, I -- LOOK,
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE
ALL VERY AWARE OF
IS WHAT WE CALL
THE GOLD DIGGERS, RIGHT?
SOMEONE COMING IN
NOT REALLY LOOKING FOR A DEAL,
JUST LOOKING FOR THE P.R.
ABSOLUTELY.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A GOLD DIGGER.
I THINK YOU HAVE
REAL REASONS TO BE HERE.
MY QUESTION IS
WHAT COMES NEXT?
THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO IT
TO BE A SUSTAINABLE COMPANY.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY MORE.
THE -- THE AMAZING THING,
AND WHAT IS BLOWING MY MIND,
IS THE SUSTAINABILITY OF
THIS DESIGN IN AND OF ITSELF.
SO IT'S BEEN 24 MONTHS.
THIS SHIRT CONTINUES TO SELL.
HAVE YOU TRIED SELLING
IN ANY LARGE RETAILERS?
WE'VE NOT GONE AFTER ANYTHING,
AND, YOU KNOW, QUITE FRANKLY,
JUST WITH JUST ME --
DO YOU DO TRADE SHOWS
OR ANYTHING?
DO A FEW TRADE SHOWS,
AND THAT HELPS BRING IN
SOME NEW ACCOUNTS.
John: YOU BETTER --
YOU BETTER STOP THE WHOLESALE
AND DO EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
BECAUSE IN ABOUT TWO,
THREE YEARS,
ALL THE "I LOVE NEW YORK"
COMPANIES
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE,
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THIS
IN EVERY SOUVENIR SHOP
ALL OVER THE PLACE,
SO YOU SHOULD JUST
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT,
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.
AND, REALLY, RYAN, I --
CONGRATULATIONS.
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
A GREAT JOB.
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.
THE HARD PART OF THIS IS
GOING FROM A PRODUCT
TO A REAL COMPANY, RIGHT?
I THINK WE'VE DEVELOPED A BRAND.
YOU -- YOU HAVEN'T
DEVELOPED A BRAND.
YOU'VE DEVELOPED
A VERY CONVINCING PRODUCT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT
AN INVESTABLE COMPANY.
EVERY SINGLE GREAT PRODUCT
THAT'S EVER COME OUT
IN THE CLOTHING WORLD
HAS SEEN A POINT
WHERE IT WAS HERE...
RIGHT.
AND THEN IT GOT DOWN HERE.
THE BRILLIANT COMPANIES,
THE SUPER SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES,
ARE SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DO
WHEN IT STARTS TO DIP,
RIGHT?
I JUST DON'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO WHEN THAT TIME COMES.
I HAVE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE DYING
FOR OTHER COLORS.
I HAVE E-MAILS DAILY.
RYAN.
RYAN, THAT'S GREAT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT
A LONG-TERM COMPANY.
AND AS AN INVESTOR,
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO SEE,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
RYAN, YOUR COMPANY'S ON FIRE.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU'RE KILLING IT.
YOUR SALES ARE REMARKABLE
FOR A T-SHIRT.
BUT THERE IS A LOT AT RISK
IN THE CLOTHING BUSINESS.
IT'S GONNA DIP.
THE HIGHS ARE HIGH,
AND THE LOWS ARE LOW.
SO, YOU GOT TO BUILD IN
SOME RISK.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
$250,000 FOR 35%.
ANY THOUGHTS FROM YOU, LORI?
AND THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
WHAT IF I GAVE YOU
$250,000 FOR 30%?
I W-- SO LET'S --
LET'S HYPOTHETICALLY SAY --
JUST DO THE MATH, RIGHT?
JUST DO THE MATH.
THAT'S LESS --
THAT'S LESS
THAN I'M MAKING THIS YEAR.
I WOULD BE SAYING,
"HERE'S THE COMPANY.
I'M WILLING IT AWAY."
I WOULD WANT TO DO A FAIR DEAL
WITH YOU GUYS, AND 30% OR 35% --
RYAN, YOU CAME OUT
LOOKING FOR 5%.
YOU,
BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION --
O'Leary: RYAN.
Greiner: BUT YOU SAID
THAT YOU --
IT WAS A STARTING POINT --
YOU DON'T WALK OUT HERE
TO BE STUPID.
O'Leary: YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
YOU'RE SMART, RYAN.
STICK TO YOUR GUNS.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
YOU GOT ONE
FOR 30% AND $250,000,
AND THE OTHER 35% --
DON'T TURN STUPID ON US,
RYAN.
FOCUS ON THOSE.
NOW YOU FOUND OUT
THE REAL MARKET VALUE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S THE REAL MARKET VALUE,
AND NO INSULT TO THE OFFERS.
YOU JUST HEARD TWO OFFERS!
I COULD ENTERTAIN SOMETHING
IN THE 10% RANGE,
AND HAPPY TO DISCUSS THAT.
IN THE 10% RANGE?
10%, 15%.
I'M JUST OPENING THE DOOR.
Herjavec: RYAN. RYAN.
IN THE 10% RANGE, I'M TAKING
MY MONEY AND GOING HOME.
I'M OUT.
RYAN, YOU HAVE AN OFFER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'M SORRY.
I CA-- I-I WOULD LOVE
TO PARTNER WITH YOU,
BUT I JUST CAN'T DO THAT MUCH.
WHAT'S YOUR COUNTER?
WE COULD DO 10% AND $400,000.
OH.
OH, MY GOSH.
OH!
OH, YOU'RE RAISING
THE MONEY, TOO.
I FORBID YOU
TO DO THAT DEAL.
IT'S A $4 MILLION VALUATION.
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE --
NO, I'M SORRY.
IT'S A T-SHIRT COMPANY!
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
OKAY.
PHEW.
RYAN, I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 20%.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
O'Leary: OKAY.
PHEW.
RYAN, I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 20%.
I'M -- I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST --
YOU DIDN'T WANT A DEAL THEN,
LIKE I THOUGHT.
Cuban: YEAH, HE DID.
SEE, I DON'T AGREE
WITH THAT, RYAN.
DON'T -- DON'T -- DON'T GET
BUMMED OUT ABOUT THAT.
ENOUGH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT OFFER?
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
BUT IT'S JUST --
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT --
THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE
SAYING THE COMPANY'S WORTH.
I'M MAKING MORE THAN THAT
THIS YEAR.
JUST -- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU REALLY ARE.
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICES.
NO, HE'S NOT, MARK.
YES, HE IS. HE'S RIGHT.
NO, HE'S NOT.
WELL, THEN, EITHER THAT,
OR HE'S ONE HELL OF A LIAR.
EITHER THAT OR HE'S A LIAR
'CAUSE HE'S GIVING YOU --
John: I GAVE YOU --
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
20% FOR $250,000 --
THAT'S WORTH MY TIME,
AS WELL.
THAT -- THAT'S ONE TIME
HE'S STUPID.
HE'S NOT HERE FOR A DEAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE WOULD BE --
HE WOULD BE
THE MORON OF THE CENTURY
IF HE SOLD $1 MILLION
IN SALES
AT A MILLION-DOLLAR
VALUATION.
YOU WANT TO STEP OVER DOLLARS
TO SAVE PENNIES,
THAT'S UP TO YOU.
I'M IN THE SAME EXACT INDUSTRY
AS YOU.
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I DON'T
DESERVE 1/5 OF THE COMPANY
TO BUST MY BUTT
AND MAKE IT A BIGGER COMPANY?
SO, I HAVE ALWAYS
BUSTED MY BUTT.
I'M NOT SAYING, "DAYMOND,
COME WORK FOR ME FULL TIME."
YOU OPEN SOME DOORS,
THROW SOME BREAD CRUMBS.
I'M HAPPY TO CHASE IT.
I'M NOT HERE TO OPEN DOORS
AND THROW BREAD CRUMBS.
I'M HERE
TO BE A PARTNER WITH YOU.
I-I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU COMING BACK IN,
BUT AT $1 MILLION,
I'M GONNA MAKE MORE THAN THAT
IN THIS 12-MONTH PERIOD.
AND I -- WELL,
LIKE MY FRIEND ALWAYS SAYS,
"YOU'RE DEAD TO ME, TOO."
THANK YOU. WELL, I HOPE
YOU ENJOY YOUR T-SHIRTS.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, RYAN.
CONGRATULATIONS, RYAN.
GOOD LUCK.
THAT WAS WEIRD, DAYMOND.
NO, IT'S NOT.
HE'S NOT THAT STUPID.
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
YOU DON'T SELL
A MILLION DOLLARS IN EARNING
IN THE CURRENT YEAR
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
THAT MILLION DOLLARS
IS PAPER THIN -- PAPER THIN.
BUT IT'S STILL SPENDABLE.
PAPER THIN.
TOTAL COMMODITY.
IT'S A T-SHIRT.
Shell: THAT WENT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN I THOUGHT.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE COME IN
AT HIGHER THAN 5%.
MAYBE I JUST COMPLETELY
SCREWED THAT UP.
I-I DON'T KNOW.
