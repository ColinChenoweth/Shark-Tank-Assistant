HI. I'M ALEX FURMANSKY
FROM PALM BEACH, FLORIDA.
I'M RAISING $100,000
IN SEED FUNDING
FOR 5% OF MY HEARTWARMING
COMPANY, CALLED BUDSIES.
CHILDREN HAVE
THE MOST AMAZING MINDS.
THEIR IMAGINATION INSPIRES THEM
TO CREATE THE MOST
FANTASTIC ARTWORK.
SO, RATHER THAN LET THEIR
ARTWORK TAKE OVER OUR FRIDGE
OR GET LOST IN PILES IN ATTICS
OR BASEMENTS, GONE FOREVER,
HOW CAN WE TREASURE IT?
IMAGINE IF WE COULD MAGICALLY
TRANSFORM YOUR CHILD'S ARTWORK
INTO SOMETHING REAL, SOMETHING
TANGIBLE...SOMETHING HUGGABLE.
NOW WE CAN,
WITH MY COMPANY, BUDSIES.
BUDSIES BRINGS KIDS' ARTWORK
TO LIFE.
KIDS LOVE THEIR BUDSIES
MORE THAN ANY OTHER TOY
BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES
DESIGNED IT.
THEY ARE THE ONLY CHILD
IN THE WORLD WITH THAT BUDSY.
WE'VE MADE EVERYTHING FROM
ORANGE DINOSAURS TO COWGIRLS
TO ONES I CAN'T REALLY
FIGURE OUT A NAME FOR,
BUT THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE.
YOU KNOW, IN THIS WORLD WHERE
KIDS ARE GLUED TO THEIR PHONES
AND THEIR TABLETS,
I'M PROUD TO PRESENT A PRODUCT
THAT BRINGS TOGETHER IMAGINATION
AND REAL-WORLD PLAY.
SO PLEASE, SHARKS, HELP ME
BRING THE MAGIC OF BUDSIES
TO MILLIONS OF CHILDREN
AROUND THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.
AND WITH THAT, I'D LOVE TO SHOW
YOU SOME OF OUR CREATIONS,
STARTING WITH ROB.
WE HAVE A ROBOT MONSTER DUDE.
OH, VERY COOL.
THANK YOU.
LORI, WE HAVE -- I THINK THIS
WAS A SELF-PORTRAIT OF SOMEONE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
LOOKS SO MUCH
LIKE YOU, LORI.
MR. WONDERFUL, OF COURSE,
THE HEART, JUST FOR YOU.
ONLY LOVE FOR YOU.
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THE BIG, BAD WOLF.
AND THE SHARK.
THANK YOU, MARK.
John:
SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
THE CHILD DRAWS THIS,
AND YOU MAKE IT.
Furmansky: EXACTLY.
SO PARENTS SIMPLY TAKE A PICTURE
OF THEIR KID'S ARTWORK,
WITH ANY CELLPHONES.
THEY TEXT THAT IMAGE TO US.
OUR SOFTWARE
AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTS THE IMAGE
AND BINDS THAT TO THEIR ORDER.
FIRST, WE HAVE A DESIGNER HERE
IN THE STATES.
SHE INTERPRETS AND APPROVES
EACH ARTWORK THAT COMES IN.
AFTER THE DESIGNER HERE
APPROVES IT,
THE ORDER GETS ROUTED
TO A FACTORY OF OURS IN CHINA.
Greiner:
WHAT DOES ONE COST?
THESE COST $69 IN RETAIL.
WHOA.
Furmansky:
IT COSTS US ABOUT $35 TO MAKE,
SO WE HAVE A 50% MARGIN.
ALEX,
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?
WHAT'S THE LEAD TIME
FOR ONE?
SO, CURRENTLY,
IT TAKES FOUR WEEKS.
OH!
AND THAT SCALE WE GONNA --
THAT DOWN TO TWO WEEKS.
THE KID HAS GROWN UP
AND GONE TO COLLEGE
BY THE TIME THE THING ARRIVES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Furmansky: NOT AT ALL.
IN FACT, YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
THESE KIDS -- WE'VE GOTTEN SO
MANY VIDEOS THAT PARENTS SENT US
OF THE KIDS OPENING,
UNWRAPPING THEIR BUDSIES.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THIS?
WE'VE BEEN NOW SELLING
FOR SEVEN MONTHS.
SO, IN SEVEN MONTHS,
YOU'VE SOLD HOW MANY?
2,000.
Greiner:
IN 7 MONTHS, 2,000?
CORRECT.
SO, WHAT WAS
YOUR GROSS REVENUE?
$94,000 IN REVENUE.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE
ON THAT?
GROSS MARGIN -- WHAT WERE
YOUR GROSS MARGINS?
GROSS MARGINS -- SO, $39,000.
WOW.
YOU'VE BASICALLY TOLD ME
THIS BUSINESS IS WORTH
$2 MILLION TODAY.
SURE.
ALL RIGHT,
$100,000 FOR 5%.
SURE.
YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
YOU'VE ONLY SOLD
2,000 UNITS.
SURE.
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?
RIGHT, VERY IMPORTANT. SO --
YES, IT IS.
I'VE SEEN US SELL 2,000 OF THESE
IN JUST 7 MONTHS.
I KNOW THIS HOLIDAY SEASON,
WE CAN GET TO 6,000
WITHOUT A PROBLEM.
THAT'S $450,000 OF REVENUE.
AND THE NEXT YEAR,
I KNOW WE CAN SELL 28,000 UNITS,
WHICH IS $2.4 MILLION
OF REVENUE.
SO THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE MONEY.
I THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY HARD TO SCALE.
I SEE US
AS BECOMING THE BUSINESS --
THE WORLDWIDE LEADER IN
ON-DEMAND CUSTOM PLUSH ANYTHING.
FOR EXAMPLE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT CORPORATE.
CORPORATE, IN TERMS
OF MASCOTS, EMBLEMS, LOGOS.
WE'VE JUST --
THIS EXISTS.
GUYS DO IT ALREADY.
YEAH, THERE'S LOTS OF
COMPANIES THAT DO THAT.
BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE MINIMUMS.
SO INSTEAD OF ME BUYING ONE
FOR EACH OF MY KIDS,
YOU CAN SELL 50 TO A BRAND.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
HOW YOU CAN AUTOMATE THAT.
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING
THAT IS SO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENTIATED
THAT YOU PREEMPT OTHER PEOPLE
FROM COMPETING WITH YOU.
IF YOU'D HAVE WALKED IN
AND TALKED ABOUT 3-D PRINTERS
AND HOW YOU'RE ALL SET UP,
BING, BING, BING, BING, BING.
BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT
NONE OF THAT.
IT'S STILL "CREATE, PICTURE,
SHOW, SO...DONE."
YES. YES.
BUT WE ARE THE GO-TO PEOPLE
TO DO THAT.
YOU'RE NOT. I'M OUT.
THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING WITH IT
IS PLUSH TOYS --
IT'S A MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
GLOBAL BUSINESS.
THE PRICE POINT'S
EXTREMELY LOW.
I THINK I COULD FIND THIS
FOR $9.99, OKAY?
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE YOUR CHILD'S.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
BUT I'M NOT MAKING
ENOUGH MONEY,
BECAUSE I CAN
NEVER SCALE IT.
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO ANSWER THE ONLY QUESTION
ALEX, FOR ME,
I GOT TO KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THE NEXT 12 MONTHS
BEFORE YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.
WITH JUST --
WHICH IS BUDSIES.
AND YOU HAVEN'T
DONE THAT TODAY.
YOU'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT
TOO WIDE FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
WHAT PART OF THE NEXT 12 MONTHS
HAVE I NOT --
I NOT HELPED YOU UNDERSTAND?
THE PART WHERE
YOU MAKE MONEY, ALEX.
THE PART
WHERE YOU MAKE MONEY.
WHO'S LEFT? WHO'S LEFT?
WELL, I HAVE AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE.
KEVIN GAVE AN OFFER.
THERE ARE TWO SHARKS LEFT.
John: I HATE TO SAY IT,
THAT OFFER'S ACTUALLY DECENT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AN OFFER
OF $100,000 FOR 40%.
OKAY, LET ME MODIFY MY OFFER,
BECAUSE
THERE'S COMPETITION NOW,
AND LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I'LL DO FOR YOU.
I WILL LEAVE MINE AT 50%,
BUT I'LL LET YOU
PRICE THE PRODUCT,
WITH THIS ONE COVENANT
THAT WILL FORCE YOU BACK
TO REALITY.
YOU CAN'T TAKE ANY MONEY
OUT OF THE COMPANY
UNLESS I'M GETTING 50 CENTS
FOR EVERY DOLLAR.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE MONEY
AT $69.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO INCREASE
THIS WAY HIGHER.
MAYBE IT'S $199.
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.
BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE MONEY
AT 69 BUCKS, EVER.
I COULD TAKE IT UP TO 20%, BUT
WE'D NEED A HIGHER CHECK SIZE.
SO IF YOU WANT MORE SKIN
IN THE GAME,
YOU HAVE TO PUT MORE SKIN
IN THE GAME.
SO --
[ LAUGHS ]
$100,000 FOR 40% --
THERE IS NO COUNTER ON THAT,
BECAUSE YOU ARE CRAZY
AT THIS POINT.
THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
I RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO SAY NO.
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.
THANK YOU.
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.
AND THEN THERE'S KEVIN.
OKAY, SO,
I STILL WANT 50%.
YOU FOUND A UNIQUE WAY
TO GET SOMEBODY TO PAY YOU
A LOT OF MONEY
FOR AN EXPERIENCE --
JUST NOT ENOUGH.
I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU CHARGE MORE
SO YOU CAN MAKE MONEY
ON EVERY ORDER.
SO I THINK, AS YOUR PARTNER,
I'LL HELP YOU GET THERE,
BUT I'LL ALSO GET YOU
SOMETHING ELSE --
A LOT MORE CUSTOMERS
AT A LOW COST.
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOOD AT.
I HAVE TO SAY NO TO YOU.
OKAY.
YOU'RE DEADSIE TO ME.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK, ALEX.
TAKE CARE. THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR THE,
UH, MINI-MES.
OF COURSE.
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU GUYS.
THEY WANTED HALF MY COMPANY.
IT WAS A PRETTY EASY DECISION.
I MEAN, I THINK MY COMPANY'S
WORTH SO MUCH MORE,
AS DO OTHERS, AND SO I'M SORRY
THEY WALKED AWAY,
BUT I'M NOT SORRY.
Narrator:
EARLIER THIS SEASON,
13-YEAR-OLD ANDREA CAO
AND HER MOTHER, HONG,
MADE A DEAL WITH
BARBARA CORCORAN AND MARK CUBAN
FOR THEIR HANDHELD
MASSAGE DEVICE, Q-FLEX.
YOU ARE GONNA SELL
LIKE CRAZY.
LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
Andrea:
WHEN WE CAME ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD ONLY SOLD
800 Q-FLEXES.
WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
A WEBSITE.
SO IN PREPARATION
FOR OUR "SHARK TANK" NIGHT,
MARK GOT OUR WEBSITE
UP AND RUNNING,
AND WE CROSSED OUR FINGERS
FOR SALES.
WHEN WE AIRED,
WE RECEIVED 17,000 ORDERS.
WE'VE GONE
FROM $20,000 IN SALES
TO HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
IN SALES.
BUT NOW WE'RE SO BEHIND
ON PRODUCTION AND SHIPPING.
WE'VE HAD TO HIRE
FOUR PEOPLE
TO HELP WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE
AND PRODUCT ASSEMBLY.
HERE YOU GO, LAO LAO.
EVEN MY GRANDPARENTS
ARE PITCHING IN TO HELP.
HONG, ANDREA!
HI!
Corcoran: I'M HERE TO HELP THEM
THROUGH ALL THESE ORDERS
AND START THE CONVERSATION
ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS.
$500,000 IN SALES --
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING IT
IN YOUR GARAGE.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A FULFILLMENT CENTER.
A FULFILLMENT CENTER
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
WHAT THEY'RE DOING,
BUT THEY'RE GONNA DO IT BETTER.
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
PROFESSIONAL PACKERS.
THERE'S GONNA BE BETTER
QUALITY CONTROL.
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S GONNA GIVE THESE
LOVELY WOMEN THE HOUSE BACK.
WHAT A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, SIR.
ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING
THINGS IN LIFE IS TO FEEL LIKE
YOU COULD HELP SOMEONE WHO HAS
THE SAME SPIRIT YOU HAVE.
IN ANDREA, I SEE MYSELF.
Andrea:
THE "SHARK TANK" EXPERIENCE
HAS COMPLETELY
CHANGED MY LIFE.
I'M HELPING
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
I LOOK AT THINGS
DIFFERENTLY,
AND I'VE LEARNED
SO MUCH ABOUT BUSINESS.
