HI. I'M ALEX FURMANSKY
FROM PALM BEACH, FLORIDA.
I'M RAISING $100,000
IN SEED FUNDING
FOR 5% OF MY HEARTWARMING
COMPANY, CALLED BUDSIES.
CHILDREN HAVE
THE MOST AMAZING MINDS.
THEIR IMAGINATION INSPIRES THEM
TO CREATE THE MOST
FANTASTIC ARTWORK.
SO, RATHER THAN LET THEIR
ARTWORK TAKE OVER OUR FRIDGE
OR GET LOST IN PILES IN ATTICS
OR BASEMENTS, GONE FOREVER,
HOW CAN WE TREASURE IT?
IMAGINE IF WE COULD MAGICALLY
TRANSFORM YOUR CHILD'S ARTWORK
INTO SOMETHING REAL, SOMETHING
TANGIBLE...SOMETHING HUGGABLE.
NOW WE CAN,
WITH MY COMPANY, BUDSIES.
BUDSIES BRINGS KIDS' ARTWORK
TO LIFE.
KIDS LOVE THEIR BUDSIES
MORE THAN ANY OTHER TOY
BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES
DESIGNED IT.
THEY ARE THE ONLY CHILD
IN THE WORLD WITH THAT BUDSY.
WE'VE MADE EVERYTHING FROM
ORANGE DINOSAURS TO COWGIRLS
TO ONES I CAN'T REALLY
FIGURE OUT A NAME FOR,
BUT THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE.
YOU KNOW, IN THIS WORLD WHERE
KIDS ARE GLUED TO THEIR PHONES
Furmansky: EXACTLY.
SO PARENTS SIMPLY TAKE A PICTURE
OF THEIR KID'S ARTWORK,
WITH ANY CELLPHONES.
THEY TEXT THAT IMAGE TO US.
OUR SOFTWARE
AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTS THE IMAGE
Furmansky:
IT COSTS US ABOUT $35 TO MAKE,
SO WE HAVE A 50% MARGIN.
ALEX,
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?
WHAT'S THE LEAD TIME
FOR ONE?
SO, CURRENTLY,
IT TAKES FOUR WEEKS.
Furmansky: NOT AT ALL.
IN FACT, YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
THESE KIDS -- WE'VE GOTTEN SO
MANY VIDEOS THAT PARENTS SENT US
OF THE KIDS OPENING,
UNWRAPPING THEIR BUDSIES.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THIS?
WE'VE BEEN NOW SELLING
FOR SEVEN MONTHS.
SO, IN SEVEN MONTHS,
YOU'VE SOLD HOW MANY?
2,000.
Greiner:
IN 7 MONTHS, 2,000?
CORRECT.
SO, WHAT WAS
YOUR GROSS REVENUE?
$94,000 IN REVENUE.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE
ON THAT?
GROSS MARGIN -- WHAT WERE
YOUR GROSS MARGINS?
GROSS MARGINS -- SO, $39,000.
WOW.
YOU'VE BASICALLY TOLD ME
THIS BUSINESS IS WORTH
$2 MILLION TODAY.
SURE.
ALL RIGHT,
$100,000 FOR 5%.
SURE.
YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
YOU'VE ONLY SOLD
2,000 UNITS.
SURE.
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?
RIGHT, VERY IMPORTANT. SO --
YES, IT IS.
I'VE SEEN US SELL 2,000 OF THESE
IN JUST 7 MONTHS.
I KNOW THIS HOLIDAY SEASON,
WE CAN GET TO 6,000
WITHOUT A PROBLEM.
THAT'S $450,000 OF REVENUE.
AND THE NEXT YEAR,
I KNOW WE CAN SELL 28,000 UNITS,
WHICH IS $2.4 MILLION
OF REVENUE.
SO THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE MONEY.
I THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY HARD TO SCALE.
I SEE US
AS BECOMING THE BUSINESS --
ALEX, FOR ME,
I GOT TO KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THE NEXT 12 MONTHS
BEFORE YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.
WITH JUST --
WHICH IS BUDSIES.
THE PART WHERE
YOU MAKE MONEY, ALEX.
THE PART
WHERE YOU MAKE MONEY.
WHO'S LEFT? WHO'S LEFT?
WELL, I HAVE AN OFFER
ON THE TABLE.
KEVIN GAVE AN OFFER.
THERE ARE TWO SHARKS LEFT.
John: I HATE TO SAY IT,
THAT OFFER'S ACTUALLY DECENT.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK, ALEX.
TAKE CARE. THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR THE,
UH, MINI-MES.
OF COURSE.
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU GUYS.
THEY WANTED HALF MY COMPANY.
IT WAS A PRETTY EASY DECISION.
I MEAN, I THINK MY COMPANY'S
WORTH SO MUCH MORE,
