THAT MATTERS ON "SHARK TANK" --
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?
EVERYTHING ELSE
DOESN'T MATTER.
WHO CARES ABOUT THIS?
YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY.
SO 65% MARGIN
IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
NO, IT ISN'T ENOUGH.
IT ISN'T ENOUGH AT ALL.
YOU CAN'T --
YOU CAN'T DO ENOUGH UNITS.
Greiner: I THINK THIS IS
A REALLY CREATIVE IDEA.
YES.
BUT THE PRACTICAL ASPECT --
I DON'T SEE THIS AS SOMETHING
THAT WILL EVER BE SCALABLE.
I SEE IT AS A NICE, LITTLE
BUSINESS THAT YOU CAN DO,
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT WILL EVER BECOME BIG,
Cuban: YOU KNOW WHAT?
MATT, I'M -- I'M IMPRESSED.
I REALLY, REALLY AM.
I-I THINK YOU DESERVE KUDOS.
I MEAN, PHENOMENAL JOB, TRUE
SPIRIT OF AN ENTREPRENEUR.
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
TAKE WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PROPEL
YOURSELF TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
CONGRATS, MATT.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
THIS BUSINESS IS EVERYTHING
TO MY FAMILY, TO ME.
I'VE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING
TO MAKE IT WORK.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GROWING,
WITH OR WITHOUT THIS.
