FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A UNIQUE WAY
TO BRING A CHILD'S IMAGINATION
TO LIFE.
THAT MATTERS ON "SHARK TANK" --
HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?
EVERYTHING ELSE
DOESN'T MATTER.
WHO CARES ABOUT THIS?
YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY.
SO 65% MARGIN
IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
NO, IT ISN'T ENOUGH.
IT ISN'T ENOUGH AT ALL.
YOU CAN'T --
YOU CAN'T DO ENOUGH UNITS.
Greiner: I THINK THIS IS
A REALLY CREATIVE IDEA.
YES.
BUT THE PRACTICAL ASPECT --
I DON'T SEE THIS AS SOMETHING
THAT WILL EVER BE SCALABLE.
I SEE IT AS A NICE, LITTLE
BUSINESS THAT YOU CAN DO,
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT WILL EVER BECOME BIG,
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SOLVE
THE VOLUME ISSUE.
THE PEOPLE
THAT MAKE MONEY IN PLUSH
MAKE MILLIONS OF UNITS
AT A VERY LOW COST.
HERE'S THE ONLY WAY IT WORKS,
IN MY VIEW.
AND I HAVE TO -- I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
AND IN SOME WAYS, YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY LUCKY YOU'VE MET ME.
BUT HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS.
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY.
HE ALWAYS THINKS THAT.
SILENCE.
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE AN OFFER.
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY NOISE.
O'Leary: I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
AND IN SOME WAYS, YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY LUCKY YOU'VE MET ME.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
$100,000 FOR 50%.
YOU WILL NEVER SELL
ANOTHER ONE FOR $69.
THE MINIMUM PRICE
IS $249.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU'LL EVER MAKE MONEY
OR PAY ME BACK.
Greiner:
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN --
KIND OF LIKE A TOASTER
IN A BATHTUB.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
SO, I -- I WANT
TO REITERATE HOW THIS
BECOMES AUTOMATED
CUSTOM-PLUSH ANYTHING.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST
KIDS' ARTWORK.
WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR FAMILY
THAT PEOPLE LOVE
AS MUCH AS KIDS.
Greiner: DOGS.
O'Leary: MONEY.
PETS.
WAIT, THERE'S MORE.
SO WE'VE ALREADY HAD DOZENS
OF PEOPLE SEND US --
THAT'S A DOG?
WE CREATE A BUDSY VERSION
OF THEIR PETS -- PETSIES.
WE'VE MADE DOGS, CHICKENS...
Herjavec: WHO HAS A CHICKEN
FOR A PET?
I KNOW.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
PEOPLE LOVE THEIR PETS.
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
WHY DON'T YOU DO DEADSIES?
GRANNY BITES IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DEADSIES?
DEADSIES, INTERESTING.
I THINK IT GOES BIG.
AND THERE'S SOMETHING PEOPLE
LOVE EVEN MORE THAN THEIR KIDS,
AND EVEN MORE THAN THEIR PETS.
I SWEAR, IT'LL WORK.
PEOPLE LOVE THEMSELVES.
AND SO WE'VE HAD PEOPLE --
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA BE CRYONIC, BUT...
O'Leary: I'M LIKING IT.
I'M STARTING TO LIKE IT.
[ ALL TALKING AT ONCE ]
...PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES
TO BE TURNED INTO BUDSIES.
OH, MY GOD!
I-I BROUGHT A FEW THINGS,
LEST YOU JUDGE TOO HARSHLY.
SO, LORI, YOU WANT A BUDSIE
VERSION OF ME TO SLEEP WITH?
OH, MY GOD!
MARK, YOU WANT --
O'Leary: OH, YEAH.
[Laughing] YOU WANT
THE BUDSIE VERSION OF ME?
Herjavec:
THAT IS SO CUTE!
Cuban: I'LL TRADE YOU.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S HILARIOUS.
THANKS. THAT'S AWESOME.
THANK YOU.
SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE
UNREALISTIC IS YOUR ASK --
$100,000 FOR 5%
OF THE COMPANY.
AND THAT KIND OF
MAKES ME BELIEVE,
IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS,
YOU'RE CRAZY.
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT YOU DESERVE $2 MILLION
VALUATION ON THIS COMPANY?
THIS VALUATION
IS WITH YOU COMING IN
AND US BUILDING THIS BUSINESS.
YEAH, BUT THEN YOU'RE --
SO, WAIT, WAIT,
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU'RE CHARGING ME
TO COME IN,
AND YOU'RE PUTTING A VALUATION
ON THE COMPANY
AS IF I WAS IN.
NO, THIS IS HOW, UH,
HOW ANGELS AND VCs INVEST,
IS YOU INVEST IN THE VALUE --
YOU'RE TELLING US
HOW THEY INVEST?
YOU'RE TELLING US
HOW TO INVEST?
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: MY PROBLEM IS YOU WANT
TO BE IN THE PLUSH BUSINESS.
YOU WANT TO MAKE DOGS.
YOU WANT TO MAKE CHICKENS.
YOU WANT TO MAKE DEAD PEOPLE,
I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY.
[ Laughing ]
THERE'S NO DEAD PEOPLE HERE.
DEADSIES.
DEADSIES I LIKE.
THAT WAS YOUR IDEA.
DEADSIE WORKS.
WHEN YOU'RE THIS SMALL,
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
LASER-LIKE FOCUSED.
ALL I WANT TO HEAR
FROM YOU IS
"THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO."
AND WE HAVE BEEN. SO -- SO --
"THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO."
I HAVE BEEN. I HAVE BEEN.
BUT YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE NOT.
I HAVE BEEN.
YOU KEEP TELLING ME YOU'RE
GONNA BE A PLUSH BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE TO BE
LASER-FOCUSED.
I'M EXPLAINING THE VISION
FOR ONE-YEAR, THREE-YEAR,
AND FIVE-YEAR,
BECAUSE I'M NOT BUILDING
JUST THE PRODUCT.
I'M BUILDING A BUSINESS.
YEAH.
MY NAME IS MATT REED,
AND I'M FROM PORTLAND, OREGON.
I LIVE HERE WITH MY WIFE, JILL,
AND TOGETHER,
WE HAVE A BUSINESS CENTERED
AROUND THE HONEYBEE.
HONEYBEES ARE IMPORTANT TO US
BECAUSE THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE
POLLINATION OF OUR FOOD SUPPLY.
WITHOUT BEES,
MOST OF THE FOOD THAT YOU AND I
ENJOY WOULD NOT EXIST.
ALBERT EINSTEIN ONCE SAID,
"IF THE BEE DISAPPEARED
FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH,
MAN WOULD ONLY HAVE FOUR YEARS
LEFT TO LIVE."
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT TIME COULD BE NEAR.
IN 2006,
BEEKEEPERS BEGAN TO NOTICE
HUGE LOSSES
OF THE HONEYBEE POPULATION.
WE'RE NOT SURE WHY
HONEYBEES ARE DYING,
BUT WE THINK IT'S A COMBINATION
OF PESTICIDES, HABITAT LOSS,
STRESS, AND OTHER FACTORS.
IT'S CALLED
COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER.
I WANTED TO DO MY PART
TO HELP SAVE THE BEES,
AND THAT'S WHEN MY BUSINESS
WAS BORN.
AT THE TIME, I HAD A STABLE JOB
IN THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD.
IT WAS TOO HARD
TO BALANCE BOTH OF THEM,
SO I QUIT MY JOB IN TECHNOLOGY
TO FOCUS ON MY BUSINESS
FULL-TIME.
NOW WE'RE EXPECTING
OUR FIRST CHILD,
AND WE'RE BARELY
MAKING ENDS MEET,
BUT I KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
MEANT TO DO.
WIT THE SHARKS' HELP, I THINK
WE CAN TURN THIS BUSINESS
INTO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING
TO CHANGE THE WORLD.
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MATT REED,
AND MY BUSINESS IS BEE THINKING.
I'M SEEKING $400,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF MY BUSINESS.
SIX YEARS AGO, A HONEYBEE
FLEW INTO MY KITCHEN.
MY WIFE NOTICED AND ASKED ME
TO RESCUE THE BEE,
SO I FED IT SOME HONEY.
IT DRANK AND GAINED ENERGY.
I TOOK IT TO THE FRONT PORCH,
AND I WATCHED TRIUMPHANTLY
AS IT FLEW OFF.
WELL, LATER, AS MY WIFE
WAS LEAVING FOR WORK,
SHE NOTICED DOZENS OF BEES
PELTING THE SCREEN DOOR,
TRYING TO GET IN.
THE BEE I'D RESCUED
HAD TOLD HER FRIENDS
ABOUT THE HONEY AT OUR HOUSE.
IT'S AT THAT MOMENT
THAT I WAS STUNG
BY A FASCINATION FOR HONEYBEES.
SO I WENT INTO MY GARAGE
AND BEGAN BUILDING BEEHIVES
OF VARIOUS DESIGNS,
ALL FROM WESTERN RED CEDAR,
AND I STARTED BLOGGING
ABOUT THE PROCESS.
IMMEDIATELY, PEOPLE
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
WERE ASKING TO BUY MY HIVES,
BECAUSE I WAS MAKING
ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS
FROM
THE HIGHEST-QUALITY MATERIALS.
I KNEW I WAS ONTO SOMETHING.
SOON, I COULDN'T BUILD HIVES
QUICKLY ENOUGH.
TODAY, MY COMPANY SHIPS
THOUSANDS OF HIVES
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY
TO CREATE SOME BUZZ
WITH BEE THINKING?
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
TO DATE, SINCE WE STARTED
SELLING IN MID-2009,
IS ABOUT $1.9 MILLION.
Herjavec: YOWZA.
WOW.
WHAT ABOUT
THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
THE LAST 12 MONTHS --
SO, THIS YEAR, 2014,
WE'VE DONE $775,000.
AND LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT $560,000.
WOW.
ARE YOU MAKING ANY MONEY OFF
YOUR $750,000, OR $775,000?
SO, SO FAR, PROFIT THIS YEAR
IS AROUND $120,000.
WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS?
IS IT SOMEONE BUYING
FOR THEIR KIDS,
AND IT'S JUST FUN
IN THE BACKYARD?
RIGHT. THE REASON PEOPLE
GET INTO THIS, MOST OF THEM,
SEEMS TO BE BECAUSE THEY --
THEY WANT TO HELP SOMEHOW.
MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW
HONEYBEES ARE DYING,
AND ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR FOOD
SUPPLY RELIES ON THEM.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
YEAH. IT'S TRUE.
SO IT'S -- IT'S CRITICAL
THAT WE -- WE KEEP BEES ALIVE.
HOW MUCH IS IT PER BOX?
SO, WELL, THIS HIVE HERE
IS ABOUT $360.
AND HOW MUCH DOES
THAT COST YOU TO MAKE?
UH, THIS HIVE HERE COST US
AROUND $150 TO MAKE.
AND YOU SELL IT FOR $300.
AND THAT'S INCLUDING
SHIPPING AND PACKAGING.
SO, I ACTUALLY HAVE
A LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN BEES.
IN BEEKEEPING,
OF COURSE YOU DO.
LET ME EXPLAIN.
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD
AN APPLE ORCHARD,
AND SHE ARRANGED
TO PUT BEEHIVES
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE APPLE ORCHARD,
BECAUSE IT PROMOTES
CROSS-POLLINATION
AND CREATES MORE APPLES.
THAT'S WHY YOU DO IT.
THE PROCESS
OF TENDING FOR THEM
INVOLVES EXTRACTING THE HONEY
AND PROFITING FROM IT.
THERE WAS
A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP.
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE HONEY OUT,
OR COULD YOU JUST LEAVE IT,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE DO --
IT'S MAINTENANCE-FREE?
YOU CAN TAKE TWO THIRDS
OF THE HONEY OUT, CORRECT?
GENERALLY, YOU NEED TO LEAVE
THEM 50 TO 60 POUNDS,
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE.
MY BEES HAVE TO PAY RENT,
SO I TAKE TWO THIRDS.
[ LAUGHS ]
I HAVE NO DOUBT.
THEY PROBABLY LOVE YOU.
YEAH, THEY DO.
THEY'RE VERY HAPPY.
AMAZINGLY, I BELIEVE
THAT HE KNOWS ABOUT BEES.
Cuban: THEY GOT A ROYALTY DEAL
ON THE HONEY.
Herjavec:
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THAT HIVE, THIS HIVE,
AND THE MIDDLE ONE?
SO, I'LL START WITH THIS ONE.
IT'S BASICALLY
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT.
THIS IS OUR KENYAN TOP-BAR HIVE,
OUR HORIZONTAL TOP-BAR HIVE.
Greiner: WHAT'S IN
THE MIDDLE, THERE?
SO, THIS IS A HONEYCOMB.
SO, THE BEES BUILD ALL THIS
ON THEIR OWN.
[ GASPS ]
SO YOU DUMP IN 10,000 BEES
INTO THIS BOX,
AND THEY'RE GONNA START
BUILDING COMB AFTER COMB.
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE WAX-MAKING MACHINES.
DO YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
TO THAT?
I MEAN, DOES HONEY HAVE
TO BE PROCESSED, OR...?
SO, WITH THIS STYLE,
YOU CAN CUT THE COMB RIGHT OFF,
AND THEN YOU COULD CUT IT
INTO SQUARES
AND EAT IT LIKE A SANDWICH.
John: WHERE DO YOU BUY
THE BEES AT?
SO, YOU CAN BUY THEM FROM US,
AT OUR LOCATION.
YOU'RE TELLING ME
IT'S WORTH $400,000 FOR 10%?
$4 MILLION.
THAT'S A $4 MILLION VALUATION
ON YOUR BUSINESS, OKAY?
AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE
ANY MONEY YET.
SO, WE HAVE GROWTH,
AND WE'VE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY.
WE ALSO HAVE A MARKET
THAT'S GROWING.
NOT REALLY.
BEEKEEPING --
IF YOU ASK ANY BEE SUPPLIER,
IT IS GROWING VERY RAPIDLY.
SO, IS THIS
YOUR FULL-TIME JOB?
YEAH.
I-I USED TO BE IN TECHNOLOGY.
I QUIT THAT JOB,
FINALLY, IN 2012.
MY WIFE QUIT HER JOB
THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.
DO EITHER OF YOU
DRAW A SALARY?
YES, WE DO.
AND WHAT IS THAT?
THIS YEAR,
IT WAS AROUND $50,000,
AND THAT'S 'CAUSE
MY WIFE'S ACTUALLY HOME PREGNANT
RIGHT NOW, NINE MONTHS PREGNANT.
WE'VE GIVEN UP OUR NORMAL
CAREERS AND SECURITY,
HEALTH INSURANCE.
I WENT FROM A CUSH I.T. JOB TO
SELLING BEEHIVES FOR A LIVING.
SO OUR WHOLE LIFE IS AT STAKE.
AND I-I HAVE SEVEN EMPLOYEES,
UH, WHO, YOU KNOW,
THEIR JOBS ARE AT STAKE.
O'Leary: YOU'VE PROVEN
YOU HAVE A BUSINESS.
YOU'VE PROVEN
YOU'VE GOT SALES.
BUT I'M SAYING,
WHEN IS YOUR BUSINESS
GONNA BE WORTH $4 MILLION?
YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM THERE
RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW,
THE THING ABOUT A BEE --
IT REPRESENTS IMMORTALITY AROUND
THE WORLD IN MANY CULTURES.
I WOULD HAVE TO BE IMMORTAL
TO GET MY MONEY BACK FROM YOU.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, KEVIN.
Herjavec:
THEY'RE BEAUTIFULLY MADE.
HOW MANY DO PEOPLE,
ON AVERAGE, BUY?
SO, AVERAGE ORDER, WHEN YOU
FACTOR IN OUR OTHER EQUIPMENT,
IS AROUND $210.
AND HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE
REPEAT THE ORDERS?
30% OF OUR ORDERS, IN THE PAST
MONTH, HAVE BEEN REPEATS.
Cuban: YOU KNOW WHAT?
MATT, I'M -- I'M IMPRESSED.
I REALLY, REALLY AM.
I-I THINK YOU DESERVE KUDOS.
I MEAN, PHENOMENAL JOB, TRUE
SPIRIT OF AN ENTREPRENEUR.
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
TAKE WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PROPEL
YOURSELF TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
AND, REALLY,
TAKING IN AN INVESTOR
PROBABLY WILL CREATE MORE STRESS
THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE.
I JUST DON'T SEE IT AS BEING
ABLE TO GROW FAST ENOUGH
TO SHOW ANY RETURN
ON AN INVESTMENT.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANKS, MARK.
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS GREAT, AND YOU'RE GREAT,
BUT I AM TRULY
NOT A FAN OF HONEY.
AND SO FOR ME, I CAN'T
GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS,
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I-I REALLY LOVE THAT YOU'VE
GOT IT ALL ON THE LINE.
I MEAN,
YOU QUIT A GOOD JOB,
YOUR WIFE IS PREGNANT,
YOU GOT SEVEN EMPLOYEES.
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALL IN.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
WITH THE $400,000.
MY PROBLEM WITH SALES
IS WE CAN'T MAKE THEM
FAST ENOUGH.
YOU DIDN'T COME OUT HERE AND
SAY, "GEE, IF I HAD MORE MONEY
AND I HAD MORE INVENTORY,
I WOULD SELL MORE."
THE $400,000 ISN'T GONNA
HELP YOU TODAY.
I WISH IT WOULD,
'CAUSE I'D LOVE TO BE
IN BUSINESS WITH YOU.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I THINK THERE'S ONLY
ONE SHARK LEFT.
I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS THE LAST ONE.
I THINK YOU ARE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I WAS FASCINATED BY THIS.
WELL, UH...
...YOU'RE GONNA DO $1 MILLION,
LET'S SAY, THIS YEAR,
AND LET'S SAY
YOU DOUBLE NEXT YEAR.
IF I GAVE YOU $400,000
FOR 10%,
THAT MEANS YOU WOULD MAKE IT
UP TO $4 MILLION,
AND I WOULD GET $40,000,
MAYBE, IN 2 YEARS, 3 YEARS.
IT WOULD TAKE
QUITE SOME TIME
TO SCALE UP
TO GET MY MONEY BACK.
IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THE NUMBERS WORK OUT FOR ME.
SO I AM ABSOLUTELY
A CUSTOMER...
ALL RIGHT.
...'CAUSE I LOVE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
BUT I AM NOT AN INVESTOR.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATS, MATT.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
THIS BUSINESS IS EVERYTHING
TO MY FAMILY, TO ME.
I'VE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING
TO MAKE IT WORK.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GROWING,
WITH OR WITHOUT THIS.
AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO SUCCEED.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A BETTER
WAY TO SOOTHE AND TEACH BABIES.
HELLO.
