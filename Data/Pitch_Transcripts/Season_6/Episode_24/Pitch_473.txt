JULIE, WHEN YOU PUT THIS
ALL TOGETHER,
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU INVEST?
I'VE INVESTED ABOUT $175,000.
$175,000?
Herjavec: WOW.
WOW. WHERE DID MOST
OF THAT MONEY GO TO?
OH, LET'S SEE. SAFETY TESTING
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.
RIGHT.
ALSO, I HAVE $100,000
IN INVENTORY RIGHT NOW.

SOUNDS LIKE YOU INVESTED
A LOT OF MONEY
TO GET THE PRICE BREAKS
DOWN TO $4.50.
YES, I DID.

THE $175,000 TO INVEST?
