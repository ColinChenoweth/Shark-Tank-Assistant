MY NAME IS JULIE THOMPSON,
AND I'M FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA.
I AM SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% EQUITY.
PARENTS LOVE PACIFIERS
BECAUSE THEY SOOTHE THEIR BABY.
BUT THEY CONSTANTLY FALL
OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS.
I REMEMBER WHEN MY KIDS
WERE BABIES
AND THEIR PACIFIERS
WERE CONTINUALLY POPPING OUT,
AND, OF COURSE, THEY WOULD CRY,
BECAUSE THEY STILL WANTED THEM,
IMMEDIATELY.
OFTEN, IT WAS JUST
BEHIND HIS SHOULDER.
BUT BABIES DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY CAN'T SEE.
THAT IS WHAT INSPIRED ME
TO CREATE THE PullyPalz.
PullyPalz HANG ABOVE THE BABY
AND USE SOMETHING SIMILAR
TO A PULLEY SYSTEM.
WHEN ONE PACIFIER DROPS
AND FALLS OUT OF SIGHT,
ANOTHER IS IN VIEW AND IN REACH.
THIS INTERACTION
ENABLES INDEPENDENCE,
WHICH IS GREAT FOR THOSE TIMES
WHEN PARENTS NEED AN EXTRA HAND.
PullyPalz ARE ALSO
VERY ENTERTAINING
AND PACKED
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL BENEFITS.
PARENTS ARE RAVING
ABOUT MY PRODUCT,
CREATING A DEMAND
THAT I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH.
I COULD REALLY USE SOME HELP.
SO BE A PAL
AND INVEST IN PullyPalz.
THANK YOU, AND I WOULD LIKE
TO PASS OUT SAMPLES.
Greiner:
WE'D LOVE TO SEE THEM.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
OKAY, ROBERT, THAT IS PUDDLES.
OH, THANK YOU, JULIE.
PUDDLES.
THIS IS MoMo.
THANK YOU.
HERE IS ANOTHER PUDDLES.
AND MooMoo.
MooMoo.
APPRECIATE IT.
THERE YOU GO.
Herjavec: JULIE, I REMEMBER
WHEN MY KIDS WERE SMALL --
I'M WITH YOU, HUGE PROBLEM.
PACIFIER FELL OUT
ALL THE TIME.
BUT THEN I BOUGHT A CLIP,
AND THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEM.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THAT AND A CLIP?
THE CLIP HELPED ME KEEP UP
WITH THE PACIFIER,
AND AT LEAST IT DIDN'T FALL
ON THE FLOOR,
BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE BABY,
'CAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
ONCE IT'S OUT OF THEIR LINE
OF SIGHT.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU HAVE IN SALES?
[ Sighing ] I HAVE --
THE LAST 12 MONTHS, $97,000.
WHICH ISN'T SO BAD
FOR, YOU KNOW...
NO, IT'S NOT SO BAD.
RIGHT.
WHERE ARE THESE SOLD
RIGHT NOW?
THEY'RE SOLD ON AMAZON,
AS WELL AS ABOUT 350 STORES
ACROSS THE U.S.
WHICH STORES?
UM, SPECIALTY, BOUTIQUES.
SO, WHAT DOES THIS COST?
THE RETAIL,
$19.99 UP TO $24.99.
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE?
$4.50.
WHERE ARE YOU DERIVING
MOST OF YOUR SALES FROM?
UH, TRADE SHOWS.
YOU MENTIONED
DEVELOPMENTAL BENEFITS.
YES. RIGHT-BRAIN,
LEFT-BRAIN COORDINATION.
HOW DOES IT HELP
WITH THAT?
BETWEEN YOUR RIGHT BRAIN
AND LEFT BRAIN, IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR THE TWO OF THOSE TO KIND OF
CROSS OVER BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER.
LIKE, THEY -- WHEN THEY'RE
YOUNG, THEY WILL ASK YOU,
"DOES YOUR BABY GRAB SOMETHING
AND PASS IT TO THE OTHER HAND?"
SO BECAUSE
YOU HAVE BOTH SIDES,
THE BABY'S FORCED
TO GRAB AT BOTH.
RIGHT.
SO, THERE IS ONE MORE THING
THAT'S REALLY GREAT ABOUT THIS.
WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED --
YOU CAN SEE ON THAT TREE
RIGHT THERE -- TEETHERS.
THEY POP INTO THE HOLDERS, AS
WELL, SO YOU CAN CHANGE IT UP.
IT GIVES IT MORE VERSATILITY.
YOU CAN PUT A PACIFIER ON ONE
SIDE, TEETHER ON THE OTHER.
PACIFIER ON BOTH.
AS WELL AS,
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT TREE,
THEY'RE CALLED THE MINIZ.
THESE ARE ADORABLE.
THEY'RE LITTLE MINI VERSIONS
OF THE BIG GUYS,
AND THEY ALL COME
WITH A COUNTERPART.
SO, LIKE, THE MONKEY
IS GONNA COME WITH A BANANA
THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY PEEL.
AND IT FITS INTO
THE LITTLE PULLEY SYSTEM?
AND THEY ALL --
EVERYTHING IS DESIGNED TO FIT.
O'Leary:
WHAT IS THE OUTLYING AGE
THAT A CHILD WOULD
STILL USE A PACIFIER?
I SEE 3-YEAR-OLDS WITH THEM.
YOU KNOW, I --
OKAY, LET'S MAKE IT
24 MONTHS, RIGHT?
YES.
TWO YEARS.
THAT'S PROBABLY
THE OUTSTRETCH.
SO, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF
THE POPULATION IS 24 MONTHS,
BETWEEN 0 AND 24 MONTHS,
AT ANY ONE TIME?
WELL, OVER 4 MILLION BABIES
ARE BORN IN THE U.S. EVERY YEAR.
OKAY, SO WE SHOULD SAY
THAT 8 MILLION CANDIDATES
ARE WITHIN OUR TARGET,
RIGHT?
SO WE'VE GOT 8 MILLION
CUSTOMERS A YEAR,
AND PRETTY WELL EVERY ONE
OF THEM'S GETTING ONE,
AND YET OUR SHARE,
ON A DOLLAR BASIS,
FROM WHAT YOU TOLD ME,
IS REALLY SMALL.
ARE YOU CONCERNED
WITH THE PRICE POINT
BEING TOO HIGH?
BECAUSE YOU CAN BUY
A PACIFIER
AND AN ATTACHING, YOU KNOW,
ELASTIC CORD THING...
RIGHT.
...FOR,
I DON'T KNOW, 4 BUCKS.
SURE, BUT THOSE DON'T -- YOU
KNOW, THEY'RE NOT INTERACTIVE.
IT'S NOT -- THIS IS NOT
JUST A PACIFIER HOLDER.
JUST -- IT'S COMP--
I'M JUST ASKING,
IS IT DISTRIBUTION
THAT'S THE PROBLEM?
IS IT THE PRICE POINT
THAT'S THE PROBLEM?
WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK?
WHAT IS HOLDING YOU BACK?
I'M A ONE-PERSON COMPANY.
I'M EVERYTHING. I'M --
Greiner: SO YOU DO IT ALL?
I DO IT ALL.
YOU DO THE SALES.
I'VE DESIGNED EVERY ONE
OF THESE GUYS,
DOWN TO EVERY PANTONE COLOR
AND EVERY BELLY.
MY SENSE OF WHAT'S HOLDING
THIS WHOLE THING BACK
IS THE PRICE
AND DISTRIBUTION.
NOT MANY PARENTS WOULD
SPEND $20 FOR A PACIFIER.
THAT'S MY OPINION.
THIS ISN'T A PACIFIER.
YES.
JULIE, WHEN YOU PUT THIS
ALL TOGETHER,
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU INVEST?
I'VE INVESTED ABOUT $175,000.
$175,000?
Herjavec: WOW.
WOW. WHERE DID MOST
OF THAT MONEY GO TO?
OH, LET'S SEE. SAFETY TESTING
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.
RIGHT.
ALSO, I HAVE $100,000
IN INVENTORY RIGHT NOW.
OH.
OKAY, SO, THAT'S INTERESTING,
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT?
SOUNDS LIKE YOU INVESTED
A LOT OF MONEY
TO GET THE PRICE BREAKS
DOWN TO $4.50.
YES, I DID.
John: WHERE'D YOU GET
THE $175,000 TO INVEST?
UH, RETIREMENT, COLLEGE FUNDS,
MY PARENTS' RETIREMENT,
CREDIT CARDS.
IT'S -- IT'S SCARY.
YOU'RE ALL IN, HUH?
I AM ALL IN.
WOW.
JULIE, I -- I GUESS
I CAN'T GET MY MIND
OVER THAT CLIP PRODUCT.
OKAY.
AND IT WAS
VERY INEXPENSIVE,
SO I HAVE A BIT
OF A CHALLENGE WITH THAT.
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
FLYING OFF THE SHELVES
AT THIS POINT.
I'M OUT.
I THINK, IN THIS CASE,
INVENTORY ISN'T A GOOD THING.
YES.
YOU'RE JUST NOW
GETTING IT OUT THERE.
AND TO ME, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO UPDATE IT
AND GO THROUGH REVISIONS.
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO COME OUT WITH IT
ON A TIMELY BASIS
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH
INVENTORY YOU HAVE TO PROTECT.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A PROBLEM.
I -- LIKE I SAID,
I JUST DON'T SEE THE
SELL-THROUGH FAST ENOUGH,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
IT'S A COMBINATION OF TWO
SECTORS IN THE TOY BUSINESS --
PLUSH TOYS AND PACIFIER.
PLUSH TOYS --
97% ARE SOLD AT UNDER $10.
PACIFIERS,
AS CHEAP AS A DOLLAR.
SO, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'VE GOT
THIS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
DERIVATIVE OF THE TWO OF THEM,
AND I THINK WHAT'S HOLDING YOU
BACK, JULIE, IS THE PRICE.
IF THIS WAS $9.95,
MY BET IS YOU WOULD SELL
FOUR TIMES MORE,
AND YOU CAN'T GET YOUR
MANUFACTURING COSTS
DOWN LOW ENOUGH TO DO IT.
I CAN'T GET EXCITED ABOUT GOING
DOWN THAT ROAD WITH YOU.
I'M OUT.
John: MY CONCERN IS THAT
THE HANGING APPEAL
MAY NOT BE
SELF-EXPLANATORY.
I HAVE DEVELOPED TREES,
SMALLER TREES,
BECAUSE MANY OF MY RETAILERS
WANTED THEM, AND I'VE HAD TO --
O'Leary: THAT'S EXPENSIVE
TO PUT IN RETAIL.
Greiner: DO THEY PUT IT IN?
DO THEY PUT A TREE IN?
THEY DO.
MY -- THE RETAILERS
THAT CARRY THIS PRODUCT LOVE IT
AND ARE EXCITED.
THEY PUT THAT IN
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING
WITH, GENERALLY,
SPECIALTY STORES.
BUT IF YOU GO TO A BABIES "R" US
OR BUY BUY BABY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
THAT ABILITY
WITHOUT THEM CHARGING YOU.
AND I THINK THAT'S --
THAT'S -- THAT'S ONE
OF MY DECIDING FACTORS...
SURE.
...THE FACT THAT I THINK
THAT HANGER APPEAL
IS NOT REALLY THERE,
SELF-EXPLANATORY.
SO...I'M OUT.
SURE.
WELL,
YOU HAVE ONE SHARK LEFT.
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S VERY CLEVER,
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
WHOA!
I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
OKAY.
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU $100,000
FOR 30% EQUITY STAKE.
FOR 30%.
AND I HAVE
THE CONNECTIONS...
YES, YOU DO.
...TO BUY BUY BABY
AND TOYS "R" US.
HMM. LET'S SEE.
WELL, MY ASK WAS $100,000
FOR 20%.
I THINK I JUST HEARD
THIS COW MOO.
[ LAUGHS ]
Greiner: THIS COW MOOED.
Cuban: WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, JULIE?
YOU'D BETTER TAKE THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
SO, I THINK --
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 25%?
OOH.
REALLY?
$97,000 IN SALES
FOR, YOU KNOW, ONE PERSON
AND A HANDFUL OF TRADE SHOWS --
THAT'S -- THAT'S, YOU KNOW...
BAD MOVE.
Herjavec: 5%?
FOR 5%?
YES.
GO 28% AND I'M IN.
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
WE'VE GOT A DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
I'M VERY EXCITED.
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I REALLY DO.
I LOVE IT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
GOOD. WE'LL DO GOOD.
I'M EXCITED
TO WORK WITH YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS, JULIE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
I AM SO EXCITED TO HAVE SOMEONE
TO HELP ME AND GUIDE ME
THROUGH THE NEXT STAGES
OF MY COMPANY.
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH
AND INVESTED SO MUCH IN THIS
AND WORKED SO HARD,
SO I -- I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT MEANS
TO HAVE LORI AS A PARTNER NOW.
Narrator:
NEXT UP ARE ENTREPRENEURS
WHO BELIEVE THEY'VE SOLVED
A PROBLEM FOR ATHLETES.
