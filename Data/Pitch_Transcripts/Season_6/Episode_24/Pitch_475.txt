Millogo:
I'M FROM WEST AFRICA.
I WAS THERE WHEN THE WAR
BROKE OUT IN MY COUNTRY.
I HAD MY FATHER IN MY ARMS,
LITERALLY, WHEN HE DIED.
I'VE INVESTED RETIREMENT,
COLLEGE FUNDS,
MY PARENTS' RETIREMENT.
WOW.
YOU ARE ALL FREAKIN' IN.
THIS IS HOW ANGELS
AND VCs INVEST.
YOU'RE TELLING US
HOW THEY INVEST?
YOU'RE TELLING US
HOW TO INVEST?
BAD MOVE.
I WOULD HAVE TO BE IMMORTAL
TO GET MY MONEY BACK.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO ANSWER THE ONLY QUESTION
HI. I'M JOEL VINOCUR,
AND THIS IS ARSENE MILLOGO.
WE'RE HERE TODAY SEEKING
$200,000 FOR 15% OF FORUS,
HOME OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE
WALKING, RUNNING,
WORKOUT SHOES
KNOWN TO MANKIND.
WE SET OUT TO DESIGN
THE MOST SHOCK-ABSORBENT
YET LIGHTEST SHOES
ON THE MARKET TODAY,
AND HERE THEY ARE.
FORUS.
FORUS.
JUST BY HOLDING THEM UP,
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH LIGHT
AND AIR PASSES THROUGH THEM.
THEY'RE BUILT WITH AN
UNBREAKABLE STABILITY BAR
THAT ALLOWS FOR ANY TYPE
OF WORKOUT,
BUT WEIGHS ONLY A FRACTION
OF WHAT OTHER SHOES WEIGH.
MR. MARK.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PAIR
FOR EACH OF YOU.
THANK YOU.
Vinocur:
GO AHEAD AND TRY THEM ON.
WHY DO I GET THE PINK COLOR?
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT'S RED.
OH, YES, OF COURSE IT'S RED.
IT'S FERRARI RED.
THEY FEEL PRETTY GOOD.
WHAT MAKES THEM SO SPRINGY?
THERE'S WAY MORE GIVE TO THEM.
THE INSOLE THAT YOU'RE HOLDING
IN YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW --
THE VERY BOTTOM IS GEL.
THE MIDDLE PART
IS MEMORY FOAM.
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE INSERT,
WE HAVE
THE DIFFERENT LINES.
THAT'S SET UP TO THE PRESSURE
POINT AS YOU WALK.
SO OVER TIME, THE SHOW
ACTUALLY FITS PERFECTLY.
SO YOU'RE SAYING THE MEMORY FOAM
IS ADJUSTING TO YOUR FOOT?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
DO YOU HAVE A DESIGN BACKGROUND?
I'M FROM COTE D'IVOIRE,
WEST AFRICA,
AND I WAS THERE WHEN THE WAR
BROKE OUT IN MY COUNTRY.
I LITERALLY HAD TO RUN
TO COME HERE.
THAT WAS AFTER I HAD MY FATHER
IN MY ARMS,
LITERALLY, WHEN HE DIED.
MM.
I CAME TO THE U.S., HERE,
AS A TRACK-AND-FIELD --
ON A TRACK-AND-FIELD
SCHOLARSHIP.
I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL.
WHEN I RAN TRACK,
EVERY SINGLE TIME WE RAN,
THE SHOE THAT WE HAD
HAD A REALLY THIN INSERT.
TWO WEEKS, THE SHOE INSERTS
WERE WORN OUT.
I WENT TO CHINA
WITH MY LAW SCHOOL,
AND I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO MEET ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
WHAT ARE YOU
MAKING THE SHOES FOR,
AND WHAT ARE YOU
SELLING THEM FOR?
IT RANGES FROM ABOUT $11
TO $13 TO MAKE IT.
WE WHOLESALE THEM
FOR ABOUT $35 TO $50,
DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY,
AND THEN THEY RETAIL
FOR $75 TO $85.
AND WHERE DO YOU SELL THEM?
IT'S A GENERAL RETAIL SALE.
WE HAVE A DISTRIBUTOR IN TAIWAN,
WE HAVE ONE IN HOLLAND,
AND THEN WE HAVE INDEPENDENT
SALES AGENTS ACROSS AFRICA.
AND WHERE IN THE U.S.
ARE YOU SELLING THEM?
CURRENTLY,
WE'RE DOING E-COMMERCE.
WE'RE DOING
A GUERRILLA MARKETING ATTEMPT
SIMILAR TO THAT
OF UNDER ARMOUR,
WHERE WE'RE GIVING THE PRODUCT
TO THE PEOPLE,
AND THEY'RE TELLING PEOPLE
IT'S AMAZING.
LET'S ASSUME
IT'S A GREAT SHOE, OKAY?
IT IS.
HERE'S MY QUESTION.
SO WHAT?
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT
SHOES ON THE MARKET.
THERE ARE SOME PLAYERS
THAT OWN THIS
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR MARKET.
THEY'VE GOT IT LOCKED DOWN.
WHY WOULD FORUS EVER HAVE
A CHANCE OF GAINING SHARE
AGAINST THEM
TO BE A BIG COMPANY?
EXPLAIN HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN.
HOW ABOUT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
IN 12 MONTHS?
IT'S ACTUALLY SIX --
SIX MONTHS.
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES
IN SIX MONTHS?
CORRECT.
OKAY, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I THINK
YOU'VE CONVINCED EVERYBODY
YOU'VE DESIGNED A DECENT SHOE.
WHAT'S THE PLAN TO INCREASE
SALES BY FOUR TIMES?
YOU'RE ONLY $500,000 RIGHT NOW.
WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE, ACTUALLY.
NEXT YEAR, WE'VE PROJECTED
ABOUT $2.5 MILLION.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET THERE?
THAT'S BASED ON THE CURRENT
ARSENAL WE HAVE.
THE ONLY REASON WE DIDN'T GET
THOSE SALES LAST YEAR
WAS BECAUSE WE MISSED
THE WINDOW OF THE SEASON.
Greiner: YOU KNOW WHAT? TO ME,
THERE'S THESE MAJOR PLAYERS,
LIKE SAUCONY AND NIKE
AND ADIDAS.
I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD
ACTUALLY PENETRATE THAT
SO STRONGLY THAT I WOULD GET
BACK MY MONEY.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I WANT TO SAY ONE THING.
NEXT YEAR, WE ARE SECURING
LICENSING FROM NASCAR --
THE TOP THREE DRIVERS
OF NASCAR.
ARE YOU CREATING A DRIVING SHOE
FOR NASCAR,
OR ARE YOU CREATING
A RUNNING SHOE?
ARE YOU ABOUT FASHION,
OR ARE YOU ABOUT FUNCTIONALITY?
BOTH.
BOTH.
WE'RE CREATING
A LIFESTYLE SHOE
THAT EMBODIES
THE SPIRIT OF NASCAR.
THAT -- YOU'RE CREATING
A LOT OF BATTLES
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY
TO MARKET TO.
HOW MUCH INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE?
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE
ABOUT $65,000 -- $68,000.
HOW MANY OF THE RUNNERS' STORES
YOU SOLD TO --
HOW MANY OF THEM REORDER?
ALL OF THEM.
THAT'S OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM.
THEY ALL REORDER?
YES.
WE DON'T HAVE THEM.
WE CAN'T KEEP THEM IN STOCK.
THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS SPACE --
YOU'VE GOT TO GET DISTRIBUTION,
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK
YOU HIT THE BRICK WALL,
BECAUSE TAKING A VERY FAMOUS
BRAND OFF THE WALL
TO PUT THIS THERE, INSTEAD,
THAT AIN'T FREE.
YOUR CHALLENGES
ARE NOT BEHIND YOU.
THEY'RE AHEAD OF YOU.
I'M NOT GONNA GO ON THAT JOURNEY
WITH YOU. I'M OUT.
LOOK, I CAN JUST SEE --
THIS OWNS YOU, RIGHT?
I-IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT
A BUSINESS. IT'S YOU.
THE REALITY FOR ME IS
THE MAVS HAVE GOT A HUGE DEAL
WITH ADIDAS.
I'VE GOT A BIG DEAL
WITH SKECHERS.
I'M A LOYAL GUY TO THE BRANDS
I'M WORKING WITH,
WHO HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO ME.
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE IT WORK,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
BUT I REALLY WANT YOU GUYS
TO SUCCEED.
THANK YOU.
SO, I'M GONNA TOUCH
ON SOME OF THE THINGS
SOME OF THE OTHER SHARKS SAID.
NOW, YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
DIFFERENT LINES, LIKE NASCAR.
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
ABOUT FIVE STYLES IN EACH LINE,
AND EVERY ONE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
AN AVERAGE OF SIZE 7
ALL THE WAY TO 13,
AND HALF SIZES, IN EACH COLOR,
THREE SEPARATE TIMES.
THAT CREATES
A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE,
BECAUSE YOU TURN AROUND,
AND THEN YOU HAVE $4 MILLION
WORTH OF LEFT SHOES.
I WAS SOMEWHAT INTERESTED.
I WAS ON THE FENCE.
UM...BUT I THINK THAT WE WOULD
HAVE A CHALLENGE.
SO, UH, I'M OUT.
SHARKS, ACTUALLY,
BEFORE WE CONTINUE,
WE -- WE HAVE A, UH, AN
ADDITIONAL THING THAT WE --
AS WE WERE PROMOTING THE SHOES,
WE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED
PROPRIETARY E-MAIL MARKETING
SOFTWARE CALLED ATTLO.
IT TAKES THE E-MAIL MARKETING
FROM THE INSIDE,
AND IT SHOWS IT
IN THE SUBJECT LINE.
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY, UH,
HOW WE PLAN TO PROMOTE THESE.
YOU CAN DO THAT TODAY.
WHO INVESTED IN THAT COMPANY?
ME AND ANOTHER PROGRAMMER.
MAN, YOU ARE FIGHTING
SO MANY BATTLES.
LOOK, A GUY THAT USED TO WORK
FOR ME, HE WAS, AT ONE POINT,
ACTUALLY THE 11th FASTEST MAN
IN THE WORLD.
I RUN FIVE MILES A DAY,
SO I USED TO SAY,
"HEY, LET'S GO RUNNING."
AND HE WOULD SAY TO ME,
"I CAN'T RUN FIVE MILES."
I SAID, "COME ON, MAN,
YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE.
YOU CAN RUN FIVE MILES."
"I DON'T RUN FIVE MILES.
I RUN 100 METERS
AS FAST AS I CAN.
THAT'S MY JOB."
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOUR JOB IS.
YOU'RE DOING A PERFORMANCE SHOE.
THEN YOU'RE DOING
E-MAIL SOFTWARE.
THEN YOU'RE DOING A NASCAR SHOE?
YOU'RE FIGHTING
TOO MANY BATTLES.
IF YOU WANT TO WIN,
JUST RUN THE 100 METERS.
FOCUS.
BUT HERE'S MY CHALLENGE.
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT INVENTORY.
I WANT TO BE INVOLVED.
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR $200,000 FOR 15%.
I'M WILLING TO PUT UP
SOME OF THE MONEY,
A PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY.
BUT IF YOU CAN TALK DAYMOND
TO COME BACK IN
AND HE'LL HAVE ME AS A PARTNER,
I'M HAPPY TO COME ALONG,
'CAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS
WHERE INVENTORY CONTROL
AND KNOWING HOW TO MAKE THIS
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL,
'CAUSE YOU CAN BURN THROUGH
$200,000
[SNAPS FINGERS] LIKE THIS.
SO THAT'S MY OFFER.
I'LL PUT UP SOMETHING, AND
WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE EQUITY,
IF YOU CAN GET DAYMOND
INTO THE RUNNING SHOES.
DAYMOND,
IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN SAY
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND --
YES OR NO?
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
ROBERT IS INTERESTED
IN JOEL AND ARSENE'S
ATHLETIC-SHOE COMPANY, FORUS,
BUT ONLY IF DAYMOND
WILL JOIN HIM IN THE DEAL.
Herjavec: IF YOU CAN TALK
DAYMOND TO COME BACK IN
AND HE'LL HAVE ME AS A PARTNER,
I'M HAPPY TO COME ALONG,
'CAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS
WHERE INVENTORY CONTROL
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL,
'CAUSE YOU CAN BURN THROUGH
$200,000
[SNAPS FINGERS] LIKE THIS.
DAYMOND,
IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN SAY
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND --
YES OR NO?
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
IS THERE ANY EQUITY THEY CAN
GIVE YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?
THE WHOLE DEAL'S CONTINGENT
ON YOU COMING BACK IN.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU
WILLING TO GIVE?
THE DEAL IS ONLY AS GOOD
AS THE PERSON
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE,
AND THIS INDIVIDUAL IS A
GO-GETTER WHO WON'T BE STOPPED,
BUT HE ALSO HAS A VISION,
AND I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE
WITH THE VISION.
IF HE GAVE YOU 200K,
WOULD YOU DO IT?
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE.
I CAME HERE.
I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL.
I HAD TO MOVE TO GO
TO LAW SCHOOL.
OFFER HIM SOMETHING.
DON'T TELL YOUR STORY ANYMORE.
YES.
OFFER HIM SOMETHING TANGIBLE.
I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY IN
MY FAMILY THAT DID BUSINESS.
I LEARNED. YOU KNOW HOW
I GOT TO THIS POINT?
BY LISTENING TO PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE
AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.
I WILL LISTEN TO YOU,
BECAUSE --
YOU HAVE -- LISTEN TO ME.
YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.
I DON'T WANT TO BE EXCELLENT.
I WANT TO BE AMAZING.
AND YOU CAN GET ME TO AMAZING.
YES, I GOT IT.
AND YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME NOW.
SO, DAYMOND, ARE YOU OUT?
I'M STILL OUT.
LOOK, YOU GUYS ARE ALL IN.
I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU.
YOU ARE ALL FREAKIN' IN.
MY ONLY HESITATION IS
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS
WHERE INVENTORY CONTROL
IS SO CRITICAL.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE TO SPEND THAT MONEY.
I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT SOMEBODY
LIKE DAYMOND.
DAYMOND, WE ARE WILLING TO BE
ABLE TO FIND A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN YOU
AND ROBERT, HERE,
SO WE CAN REALLY LAUNCH
THIS COMPANY.
DO YOU KNOW --
WE WAITED AND PRAYED
TO GET A PATENT ISSUED.
WE GOT A PATENT ISSUED.
I'M OUT.
IF DAYMOND'S NOT IN,
I GOT TO BE OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
Vinocur: YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S DISAPPOINTING
TO NOT GET A DEAL
WITH THE SHARKS,
BUT WE CAN WALK
OUT OF HERE
KNOWING WHAT WE CAN DO
IN THE FUTURE
AND KNOWING
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GREAT.
