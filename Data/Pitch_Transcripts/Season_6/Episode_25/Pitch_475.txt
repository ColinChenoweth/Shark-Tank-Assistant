GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
HI.
I'M DANIELLE STANGLER.
AND HI.
I'M JULIA ROSSI.
AND WE ARE
FROM CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO,
AND WE ARE THE CREATORS
OF NeatCheeks.
WE ARE SEEKING $150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
KIDS ARE GONNA GET MESSY,
BUT THE CLEANUP PROCESS
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.
UNTIL NOW, PARENTS HAVE BEEN
USING TYPICAL WIPES
TO CLEAN THEIR KIDS'
FACES AND HANDS,
AND THEIR KIDS
ARE PUTTING UP A FIGHT.
THIS IS WHAT A TYPICAL
CLEANUP BATTLE LOOKS LIKE.
Corcoran: AWW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHOA.
KEVIN'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WITH NeatCheeks, CLEANUP
IS EASY AND TANTRUM-FREE.
OUR WIPES ARE PLUSH,
MOISTURIZING, AND MILDLY SWEET.
THEY'RE PREFERRED
BY MOMS AND KIDS
BECAUSE THEY'RE GENTLE
ON SENSITIVE SKIN,
ALL-NATURAL, EFFECTIVE,
AND BEST OF ALL, THEY HAVE
A SWEET, PLEASANT FLAVOR.
THAT'S RIGHT -- FLAVOR!
FLAVOR!
LOOK HOW HAPPY NeatCheeks MAKES
KIDS DURING MEALTIME CLEANUP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Cuban:
YOU GOT TO FEED THAT KID.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE SWEETEN OUR WIPES
WITH STEVIA,
WHICH IS
A NATURAL PLANT EXTRACT.
IT'S NOT SUGAR,
SO THERE'S NO STICKY RESIDUE
LEFT ON THEIR SKIN.
INSTEAD,
WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT
IS A PLEASANT, SWEET FLAVOR
ON THEIR LIPS
AND A HUGE SMILE ON THEIR FACE
WITH EVERY WIPE.
LET'S LET KIDS EVERYWHERE GET
MESSY WITHOUT FEAR OF CLEANUP.
WHY DON'T ALL OF YOU SHARKS
GET READY TO...
WIPE ON A SMILE WITH US?
WIPE ON A SMILE WITH US.
WE WANT YOU TO EXPERIENCE
THE NeatCheeks DIFFERENCE.
WE HAVE SAMPLES
FOR YOU TO TRY.
NOW,
AS YOU OPEN YOUR PACK,
IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL
TO SMELL IT FIRST.
WE ARE CONDITIONED
TO DO THAT
'CAUSE MOST WIPES ARE
FRAGRANCED, VERSUS FLAVOR.
BUT WHAT YOU CAN ANTICIPATE
WITH OUR WIPES
IS A PLEASANT,
SWEET FLAVOR.
MMM. IT'S YUMMY.
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH IT?
SO, I WAS AT A RESTAURANT
WITH MY FAMILY.
I DIDN'T HAVE
MY TYPICAL WIPES,
JULIA, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE $150,000?
YEAH, SO, THE $150,000
WILL ALLOW US
TO GO FULL TIME
IN THE BUSINESS.
WE STILL HAVE HOUSEHOLDS
TO MAINTAIN,
AND SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A SMALL PORTION
TO PAY OURSELVES SOMETHING
IN ORDER FOR US --
HOW MUCH IS "SOMETHING"?
$50,000.
EACH?
TOTAL, OR --
EACH. YEP, EACH.
SO YOU KNOW, I HATE YOUR ANSWER
TO WHY YOU NEED THE MONEY.
WHEN YOU START A BUSINESS,
YOU DON'T PAY YOURSELF.
YOU PAY THE BUSINESS FIRST.
CORRECT.
THE BUSINESS IS
A LIVING, BREATHING THING.
MM-HMM.
IT GETS EVERY PIECE OF FOOD,
EVERY DROP OF WATER.
CORRECT.
YEAH.
YEAH.
I'M OUT.
I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT,
AND THE THING IS,
WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR FOUR YEARS.
WE HAVE SUPPORTIVE FAMILIES
THAT ALLOW IT TO PUSH FORWARD.
SO I'M TO THE POINT NOW THAT I
GET A JOB WITH ANOTHER COMPANY.
I'M GONNA SUGGEST TO YOU
THAT YOU DO THAT,
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY.
I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD ALMOST
600 SALESPEOPLE WORKING FOR ME.
I WAS A BIG BOSS,
THE BIG SHOT IN MY TOWN.
BY ANYONE'S STANDARD,
I WAS A SUCCESS,
BUT I KNEW
I WAS GOING BANKRUPT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?
I WENT OUT
AND TOOK A FULL-TIME JOB
WHILE I WORKED
MY BUSINESS.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH STEPPING BACK
BEFORE YOU GO FORWARD.
RIGHT.
Herjavec: BUT, BARBARA,
WHAT ABOUT THEIR FAMILY?
YOU COULD FIGURE IT OUT.
WOMEN IN AMERICA
FIGURE IT OUT EVERY DAY.
BUT DANIELLE AND JULIA
HAVE OFFERS
FROM BOTH LORI AND BARBARA
FOR THEIR FLAVORED BABY WIPES,
NeatCheeks.
IF EVERYTHING THAT YOU TOLD ME
IS SO, I'M GOOD.
I'LL PULL THE CONTINGENCY
ON THE PATENT,
BECAUSE I'M TRUSTING YOU
THAT YOU SAY IT'S COMING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I BRING
TO THE TABLE THAT'S NOT JUST ME.
WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE
IS I BRING
ALL MY OTHER ENTREPRENEURS.
THEY ALL LOVE EACH OTHER.
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER
ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS.
THEY TALK A FEW TIMES A WEEK.
THEY HELP EACH OTHER.
THEY SHARE RESOURCES.
WHAT YOU GET
BY COMING INTO <i>MY</i> CAMP
IS YOU JOIN
OUR HAPPY LITTLE FAMILY.
AND IT'S A HAPPY FAMILY.
Herjavec: YOU HAVE 5? KIDS.
YOU DON'T NEED MORE COMPANY.
Greiner: YOU KNOW WHAT?
O'Leary: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
DON'T START AGAIN.
DON'T START AGAIN.
NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING --
NO, NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY,
BUT I DO HAVE TO ADD THIS...
LADIES, LADIES, YOU HAVE --
YOU HAVE TO -- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, KEVIN.
I HAVE TO ADD THIS.
YOU H-- NO, YOU DON'T.
...BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S ONLY FAIR.
NO, YOU DON'T!
MY ENTREPRENEURS
ARE ALSO A FAMILY.
THEY ALL KNOW EACH OTHER
BECAUSE WE ALL GET TOGETHER,
AND THEY'RE IN MY SHOW
ON QVC TOGETHER.
? KUMBAYA, KUMBAYA ?
CALL ANY OF THEM.
WAIT.
I OFTEN GET MINE
TO SING TOGETHER AROUND A FIRE.
