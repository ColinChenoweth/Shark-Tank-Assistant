AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
FIRST INTO THE TANK ARE MOMS
WITH A SWEET WAY
TO CLEAN UP MESSY KIDS.
BUT WE ARE NOT THE MOST
EXPENSIVE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.
WE HAVE A UNIQUE
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.
IN THIS PACKAGE, AS A PARENT,
YOU GET 12 HAPPY EXPERIENCES...
JUST LIKE
AN ICE-CREAM CONE.
...WHEN YOU WIPE
THEIR FACE.
YOU KNOW, THIS TRULY
SOLVES A PROBLEM.
Stangler:
AND WE <i>ARE</i> THE MARKET.
WE HAVE A TOTAL
OF SIX KIDS COMBINED,
SO THROUGH THIS PROCESS,
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP,
FINE-TUNE, AND MAKE SURE
THAT WE'RE BRINGING
THE BEST PRODUCT TO THE MARKET.
SO, WHAT ARE SALES
THIS YEAR?
THIS YEAR,
WE ARE AT $4,000 IN SALES.
$4,000?!
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA SELL
THIS YEAR, YOU THINK?
YEAH, SO, WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT
$90,000 TO $100,000 IN REVENUE,
BASED ON LAUNCHING TO
THE LARGEST TRADE SHOW INDUSTRY
IN SEPTEMBER.
WHEN YOU GO TO THAT SHOW
AND EVERYBODY SEES
THE STEVIA-INFUSED
NeatCheeks...
YES.
...INCLUDING
SOME OF YOUR COMPETITORS,
WHO ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER
THAN YOU,
THAT HAVE COST ADVANTAGE
ON SCALE...
YEAH, SURE.
...WHAT STOPS THEM FROM
PUTTING STEVIA IN THEIR WIPE?
SO, WE HAVE A PENDING PATENT
ON OUR PRODUCT.
LOOK, I THINK
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA.
I LOVE IDEAS THAT ARE BORN
OUT OF NECESSITY.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
YEAH. THANK YOU.
NOW, THE PROBLEM I SEE
AS AN INVESTOR
IS YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA,
BUT YOU ARE COCKROACHES
IN THE FACE-WIPE BUSINESS.
YOU'RE GOING TO GO
TO A TRADE SHOW
AND EXPOSE THIS
TO EVERY COMPETITOR,
AND IF IT TAKES OFF,
THE ONLY THING THAT HOLDS THEM
BACK FROM CRUSHING YOU
LIKE THE COCKROACHES YOU ARE
IS THE PATENT.
SO, TO ME, HAD YOU COME HERE
WITH A PATENT,
I WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT IT
AND SAID, "ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA HELP
THESE TWO LADIES,"
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
THE OUTCOME OF THE PATENT.
I'M OUT.
YOU GUYS, IT'S YOUR DREAM,
AND I GET THAT, RIGHT?
FOR ME,
IT'S ABOUT MAKING MONEY.
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES
TO HELP YOU TRANSITION
FROM WHERE YOU ARE
TO A REAL COMPANY --
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME.
YOU'RE JUST TOO EARLY.
I'M OUT.
HI, I'M MARK MELNI,
AND I'M THE INVENTOR
OF THE MELNI CONNECTOR.
AND I'M ARMAND ECKERT.
I'M THE CFO.
I'M BYRON DUNN. I'M THE GUY
WHO KEEPS THE LIGHTS ON.
SHARKS, WE'RE ASKING
FOR $500,000
FOR A 5% EQUITY INTEREST
IN OUR COMPANY.
Melni: MY INVENTION'S
GOING TO COMPLETELY CHANGE
THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT IT'S GONNA CHANGE.
IT HASN'T CHANGED IT YET,
YET IT'S WORTH $10 MILLION?
ABSOLUTELY.
I HOPE BAD THINGS
DON'T HAPPEN TO YOU.
OKAY.
I'VE BEEN A LINEMAN IN THE POWER
INDUSTRY FOR OVER 30 YEARS.
IN THAT TIME,
I'VE PUT ON THOUSANDS
OF THESE COMPRESSION CONNECTORS,
ALSO KNOWN AS
A CRIMP CONNECTOR.
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW
IS SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTION
USING THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY.
ANYTIME YOU HAVE
THE END OF A WIRE,
YOU HAVE TO PUT SOME SORT
OF CONNECTOR OR TERMINATOR ON IT
TO MAKE IT UP.
SO WHAT YOU DO -- YOU PUT
THAT IN THERE, THAT IN THERE.
THIS IS CALLED A CRIMPER,
AND WHAT IT DOES --
IT CRUSHES THE CONNECTOR
DOWN ONTO THE WIRE
WITH A FEW THOUSAND POUNDS
OF FORCE.
[ GRUNTS ]
OOH.
[ SNAP ]
BET YOU HAD A LOT OF FUN
DOING THAT FOR 30 YEARS.
YEAH.
[ LAUGHS ]
LOT OF SHOULDER INJURIES.
YEAH.
IN ORDER TO
MAKE THIS UP COMPLETELY,
WE'D HAVE TO DO
FIVE MORE CRIMPS ON THERE.
UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS,
IT TAKES YOU ABOUT 10 MINUTES
TO MAKE ONE CONNECTION.
OKAY, NOW LET'S SEE
THE BETTER WAY.
ALL RIGHT.
HE TOOK YOUR LINE.
EXCUSE ME, KEVIN,
YOU TOOK MY LINES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M HELPING YOU OUT HERE,
'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO GET TO
THAT $10 MILLION PLACE.
HERE'S THE MELNI --
HERE'S THE MELNI CONNECTOR.
YOU PUT THIS IN HERE,
THIS IN THERE.
SNUG IT UP
WITH YOUR HANDS.
THAT TIGHTENS IT DOWN,
AND IT'S DONE.
HERE'S WHAT
I REALLY WANT TO KNOW --
IS IT SAFER
DOING IT THE NEW WAY?
IT'S MUCH SAFER,
AND YOU JUST SAW THAT I DID THAT
IN PROBABLY 15 SECONDS.
I GET THAT,
BUT WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
OUR SALES --
Greiner:
AND WHO ARE YOU SELLING TO?
WELL, WE HAVE OUR FIRST
PURCHASE ORDER OF $585,000.
WE WERE CONTACTED
BY A COMPANY
CALLED IRRIGATION COMPONENTS
INTERNATIONAL.
THEY SELL THEM TO
THE IRRIGATION-PIVOT MARKET.
O'Leary: SO, YOU HA--
ALL RIGHT,
WALK ME THROUGH THIS.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA
SELL IT FOR?
SO, YOU H-- LISTEN.
HOW MUCH DOES IT
COST YOU TO MAKE?
OUR MANUFACTURING COST
FOR THAT SIZE IS $15.
$15. AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
SELL IT TO THESE PEOPLE FOR?
AND WE'RE GONNA SELL IT
TO THE WHOLESALER AT $39.
THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL
APPLICATION, OKAY,
THAT MAYBE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL --
YET TO BE PROVEN.
YOU TOLD ME SO FAR,
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
THE ONLY SALE YOU HAVE
IS A PURCHASE ORDER --
NOT FILLED YET --
FOR $500,000.
IS THAT RIGHT?
$585,000.
$585,000, YES.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MINDS PUTTING
A $10 MILLION VALUE ON THIS.
Melni:
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
THIS -- WE -- WE'RE ENTERING
THE MARKETPLACE
ON THE AGRICULTURAL
THROUGH THESE -- THESE PIVOTS.
BUT WHY AREN'T YOU
GOING AFTER <i>THIS</i> MARKET?
WE ARE. WE'RE SIMULTANEOUSLY
GOING AFTER --
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY ORDERS
FROM <i>THIS</i> MARKET?
NOT YET, NO.
[ GROANS ]
WE'VE MET WITH HOME DEPOT,
AND WE'VE MET WITH LOWE'S.
MARK, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PROPOSING AN INDUSTRIAL SALE,
SO DID I.
BUT YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE GOING DOWN
THE CONSUMER MARKET.
ALSO CONSUMER?
THE REAS--
LET'S BACK UP
FOR A SECOND.
PLEASE.
WE HAVE
MULTIPLE PRODUCTS.
THIS IS JUST ONE PRODUCT,
AND IT CROSSES MANY INDUSTRIES.
IT CROSS THE MILITARY.
IT CROSSES UTILITIES.
IT CROSSES RESIDENTIAL,
COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL.
BUT, MARK, YOU CAME OUT TODAY
WITH <i>THIS</i> PRODUCT.
YES.
YEAH,
LIKE, I DIDN'T KNOW --
I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS
TO BE BOUGHT BY, YOU KNOW,
THE STATES AND GOVERNMENT.
YEAH, YOU GUYS DIDN'T DO
A GOOD JOB
OF CONVEYING
THAT THERE'S A CONSUMER OPTION.
I NEED TO GET AWAY
FROM THE PRODUCT FOR A MINUTE.
I NEED A MENTAL BREAK.
HOW DID YOU TWO GUYS
GET TOGETHER?
I GOT TO TELL YOU
THE STORY, BARBARA.
WELL, PLEASE DO.
LET'S HEAR IT.
BYRON OWNS A MAGAZINE
IN COLORADO.
HE'S BEEN A 30-YEAR LINEMAN,
AND HE STARTED THE MAGAZINE.
WHAT MAGAZINE?
PERFECT!
PERFECT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, I CALLED HIM UP, AND I SAID,
"THIS IS A NEW THING."
HE SAID, "SEND ME ONE.
LET ME SEE IT."
AND THEN HE INVESTED $50,000
IN THE PRODUCT.
WOW.
Dunn:
I'M NOT A BUSINESSMAN.
IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES
TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT WORKS,
AND AS A LINEMAN,
I WANTED IN.
BYRON, WHAT WAS THE
VALUE OF THE COMPANY
WHEN YOU PUT IN $50,000?
I NEVER ASKED.
BYRON,
WHY DID YOU TRUST HIM?
I DON'T TRUST <i>HIM</i> AT ALL.
IT'S THIS PRODUCT.
[ CORCORAN LAUGHS ]
IT'S -- IT'S --
IT'S WHAT IT IS, IS THIS --
BYRON, YOU ARE AWESOME.
WELL, THIS TAKES AWAY <i>THIS.</i>
THIS IS A KILLER.
O'Leary:
I LOOK AT IT AND SAY,
"LOOK, YOU MAY HAVE BUILT
A BETTER MOUSETRAP."
THERE'S A LOT
OF EVIDENCE HERE.
PARTICULARLY, YOU GOT A LINESMAN
TO PUT UP HIS MONEY
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING
WHAT THE VALUATION WAS.
THAT'S VERY --
THAT WAS POWERFUL.
THAT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL PART
OF YOUR PITCH.
IT'S A GREAT ENDORSEMENT.
Greiner: $50,000
IS A LOT OF MONEY.
NOW YOU HAVE THE CHALLENGE
OF EXECUTION.
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO MANUFACTURE
AT AN ATTRACTIVE COST.
YOU HAVE TO DEFINE
WHICH MARKETS
AND WHAT TIMING
YOU'RE GONNA GO AFTER THEM IN.
YOU KNOW,
SELLING TO A UTILITY
IS FAR MORE CHALLENGING
IN TERMS OF TIMING,
VERSUS A CONSUMER PRODUCT
AT A LOWE'S, FOR EXAMPLE.
IT'S NOT WORTH $10 MILLION
TODAY -- NOT TO ME.
I'M OUT
WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.
WHAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOT
A CONCEPT OF
IS HOW BIG
CAN YOUR SALES BE.
NOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA
SIT HERE AND SAY,
"IN A YEAR,
OUR SALES CAN BE $1 BILLION,"
$10 MILLION VALUATION
LOOKS CHEAP.
THE ELECTRICAL-INDUSTRY
CONNECTOR MARKET'S
A $50 BILLION MARKET.
WE'RE PROJECTING NEXT YEAR, OUR
SALES ARE GONNA BE $6 MILLION.
THAT'S 110,000 UNITS --
NOT VERY MANY.
AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR?
AND PROBABLY ABOUT $18 MILLION
AFTER THAT.
Corcoran: YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
COME INTO THE SHARK TANK
AND YOU MAKE
YOUR PRESENTATION,
I ALWAYS LIKE TO GET IT
REALLY FAST --
GET WHAT YOU'RE SELLING,
GET THE NUMBERS.
KIND OF THOUGHT
IT WAS ONE TOOL
WITH ONE APPLICATION
FOR THE INDUSTRIAL SPACE.
THEN I HEARD "CONSUMER."
I THINK YOU DIDN'T
COMMUNICATE THAT WELL AT ALL.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Greiner: I THINK IT SEEMS
LIKE A BETTER MOUSETRAP.
IT SEEMS REALLY SMART.
BUT WHAT SEEMS
REALLY DIFFICULT IS
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET IT OUT THERE,
AND HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO SELL IT?
AND I THINK THAT I'M NOT
THE RIGHT SHARK FOR THIS,
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
Herjavec:
LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I'M AT.
WHAT I LOVED
ABOUT YOUR PRESENTATION,
AND WHERE I REALLY HOPED
YOU WERE GOING,
WAS TO
THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET.
BYRON IS THE REAL DEAL.
I SEE THE APPLICATION.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE THE USER
OF THE PRODUCT.
BUT...
WE WENT FROM BYRON...
TO IRRIGATION SYSTEMS...
TO HOME DEPOT.
YOU KNOW,
IN FAIRNESS, MARK,
I'M SURE YOU GUYS
ARE VERY NICE GUYS,
BUT IF BYRON
WASN'T STANDING THERE...
OH, BOY.
OH, BOY.
YEAH.
HOW LONG WOULD THIS PRESENTATION
HAVE BEEN?
OH, BOY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M OUT.
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
POINT-BLANK --
I DON'T KNOW THIS BUSINESS
AT ALL.
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WHEN I WAS STARTING
AudioNet,
WHICH TURNED INTO
THE STREAMING INDUSTRY,
BASICALLY,
I HAD PEOPLE COMING TO ME,
THROWING MONEY AT ME.
WE HAD ZERO IN SALES --
NOTHING.
NOT ONE PERSON UNDERSTOOD
WHAT WE WERE DOING.
YEAH.
THEY JUST KNEW, BASED OFF
OF WHAT WE WERE SHOWING THEM,
THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT AND SOMETHING BIG.
I BRAND THAT
"FOMO INVESTING."
YOU KNOW WHAT "FOMO"
STANDS FOR?
"FEAR OF MISSING OUT."
[ LAUGHTER ]
EVERYBODY THAT
YOU'VE COME IN CONTACT
HAS PUT THEIR MONEY
WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS.
MM-HMM, YES.
SO HERE'S MY OFFER.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE 500K
FOR 12%,
AND I WANT AN OPTION TO PUT IN
ANOTHER MILLION DOLLARS
AT A $15 MILLION VALUATION,
MEANING IF YOU GROW AND THINGS
ARE GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN,
RIGHT, I GET THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BUY MORE OF THE COMPANY.
WOW.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
MAY I --
MAY I MAKE A CALL?
OH, HELL NO.
YOU GUYS TAKE MY OFFER?
...TO DROP YOUR EQUITY
A LITTLE BIT?
...YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M JUST ADVISING YOU...
ABSOLUTELY, MARK.
THANK YOU.
DEAL.
Greiner: WHOO-HOO!
[ CHUCKLES ]
BYRON, YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR 50 GRAND.
SO GLAD HE DID THAT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
YOU'RE AWESOME.
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YEAH, GUYS.
THANKS, EVERYONE.
LET'S GO MAKE
WHATEVER THAT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S DO IT.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANKS, GUYS.
BYE-BYE.
THANKS.
BYE-BYE.
BYE.
BYRON!
LIFE IS GOOD.
[ LAUGHS ]
BYRON,
YOU ARE AMAZING.
Dunn: I DON'T EVEN
REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,
'CAUSE I'M NOT
A BUSINESSMAN,
BUT I KNOW
THAT CONNECTOR'S GOOD,
AND I KNOW THE LINEMEN
ARE GONNA LIKE IT,
SO I'M JUST VERY HAPPY.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A TECHNOLOGY FOR BOOK LOVERS.
WE WENT AFTER
SPECIFIC KEY MARKETS.
FOR YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AT THIS,
YOU HAVE TO BECOME
UBIQUITOUS.
YOU NEED
HIGH-PROFILE BOOKS
FROM MAJOR AUTHORS
THAT WANT TO BE BINKED.
YES.
YOU GET A "HARRY POTTER,"
AS AN EXAMPLE, BINKED,
YOU'RE DONE.
YES.
WE RIDE THAT WAVE.
EVERYBODY ELSE
WILL COME TO YOU.
YES.
BECAUSE --
HAVE YOU APPROACHED
ANY PEOPLE LIKE --
LIKE LARGE PUBLISHERS,
AND --
YES, YES, YES.
SO WHERE ARE YOU WITH THAT?
WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH
A THRILLER AUTHOR WHO IS BIG.
LOOK, WHAT WILL
MY INCREMENTAL SALES BE
TO OFFSET THE COST
OF DOING THAT?
YES.
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.
YOU TELL ME I BINK IT
AND I GET A 60% LIFT,
30% LIFT, 20% LIFT,
THEN I CAN MEASURE WHETHER IT'S
WORTH PAYING YOU IN PERPETUITY
OR ROYALTY.
I THINK
THE MODEL'S UNPROVEN YET.
HAVING SAID ALL THAT, GUYS,
I'M NOT THERE ON THIS.
YOU ARE AT THE VERY BEGINNING
OF A VERY ROCKY ROAD.
I'M OUT.
WE HAVE DE-RISKED
THIS BUSINESS...
[ Chuckling ] NO.
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.
...FROM THE TEAM TO THE MARKET
TO OUR REFERENCE ACCOUNTS.
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.
YOU'VE RAISED $600,000.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DRIVE DEMAND.
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO PAY THE MAJOR AUTHORS
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO GET
PAID TO DO THE WORK
AND TO CONVERT THEIR VERSIONS
TO BINK.
DO YOU LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY
ENOUGH TO HELP US GET THERE?
NO.
I MEAN, I'M SURE
YOU'RE A BRILLIANT PROGRAMMER,
BUT I THINK YOU'VE TRIED
TO EXTEND TECHNOLOGY
THAT'S ALREADY THERE.
I JUST DON'T SEE IT, GUYS.
IT'LL TAKE MORE CASH THAN
I'D EVER BE WILLING TO APPLY.
I THINK
YOU'VE GOT COMPETITION
YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE
THAT YOU HAVE.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
Greiner:
I THINK IT SOUNDS REALLY SMART,
AND A MUCH BETTER
READING EXPERIENCE,
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
VERY COMPLICATED
FOR YOU TO BE ABLE
TO GET THAT OUT THERE
AND MAKE MONEY FROM IT.
I CAN'T INVEST. I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND
A MORE TENACIOUS
AND DRIVEN GROUP OF PEOPLE.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
Corcoran:
I HAPPEN TO SEE THE MERIT IN IT.
I HAVE A VERY GOOD-SELLING BOOK
FOR 12 YEARS NOW.
I COULD PICTURE A MILLION SPOTS
WHERE I COULD HAVE A BINK
AND REALLY ENRICH
THE EXPERIENCE.
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA MAKE YOU
A LOT OF MONEY.
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE FAITH
THAT THIS BUSINESS WILL WORK.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S LEFT?
IT'S ME.
WE NEED THE MONEY
FOR OUR GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY
SO THAT WE CAN TEST
THAT HYPOTHESIS.
RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE SEARCHING
FOR A REVENUE MODEL. YOU ARE.
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY.
I JUST CAN'T GET BEHIND IT
RIGHT NOW.
AND FRANKLY, $350,000,
FOR THE WAY I SEE YOU HAVING TO
BUY YOUR WAY INTO THE MARKET --
IT'S JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET.
IT WOULD TAKE MILLIONS.
AND I'D BE INTERESTED
IF YOU HAD A VERY CLEAR PATH,
BUT YOU DON'T.
I'M OUT.
HOME-IMPROVEMENT STORE,
OR EVEN YOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET,
AND YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE
A DISPLAY OF PLANTS.
I KNOW
THOSE PLANTS HOLD AS MUCH
AS 85% PEAT MOSS
IN THOSE CONTAINERS.
PEAT MOSS IS STRIPPED AWAY FROM
DRAINED AND DEGRADED PEAT BOGS
THAT WE ARE DEPLETING,
AND THAT WOULD AID US
IN OUR FIGHT
AGAINST GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
IF WE SIMPLY LEFT THEM ALONE.
AND THAT'S WHY
I INVENTED PittMoss.
PittMoss IS MADE
FROM RECYCLED PAPER
AND A SECRET FORMULA
OF ORGANIC ADDITIVES,
AND IT HAS PROVEN ITSELF
TO BE SUPERIOR TO PEAT MOSS
IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY.
WE EVEN GREW THESE PLANTS HERE
IN PittMoss
AND SHIPPED THEM ALL THE WAY
FROM PITTSBURGH FOR YOU.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, SHARKS?
WHO WANTS TO BE
A DIRTY CAPITALIST
AND INVEST IN MY SOIL
ALTERNATIVE CALLED PittMoss?
CAN WE SEE IT?
I HAVE A QUESTION.
ABSOLUTELY.
CAN WE --
JUST A SAMPLE?
HOW DOES THE PRICE COMPARE
TO DIRT -- REGULAR OLD DIRT?
WELL, WE'RE NOT COMPARING
TO DIRT.
AND HOW DOES IT COMPARE
TO PEAT MOSS?
PEAT MOSS IS
A PREMIUM PRODUCT
THAT GREENHOUSES
AND NURSERIES USE,
AND IT SELLS
ON A CUBIC-FOOT BASIS.
PEAT MOSS RANGES
ABOUT $2.50.
AND THIS RANGES
HOW MUCH?
WE MAKE 60% PROFIT
AT $2 A CUBIC FOOT.
SO IT'S 20% CHEAPER?
IT'S ABOUT
15% TO 25% CHEAPER.
AND IT'S GREEN.
AND IT'S GREEN.
WE ACTUALLY CAN SAVE GROWERS 15%
ON THEIR OPERATING COSTS,
BECAUSE IT'S SUPERIOR
TO PEAT MOSS.
THE NATURAL PRODUCT
CARRIES IN PATHOGENS --
WEED SEEDS, MOLD SPORES,
INSECT LARVAE.
OURS IS COMPLETELY UNIFORM,
STERILE PRODUCT.
AND ONE LAST THING --
OUR GROWERS
WHO ARE USING IT RIGHT NOW
REPORT THAT
IT RETAINS MOISTURE LONGER.
IT'S A VERY GOOD THING
FOR THE PLANET.
IF THEY WERE WATERING EVERY DAY
WITH REGULAR PEAT MOSS,
THEY'RE WATERING EVERY OTHER DAY
NOW WITH PittMoss.
TELL US ABOUT YOUR SALES.
OUR SALES.
YEAH.
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
OUR SALES SUCK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S HONEST.
WE BUILT THIS PLANT IN
NORTH HUNTINGTON, PENNSYLVANIA,
OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH,
LAST SUMMER.
I QUIT MY JOB.
I CASHED OUT MY 401(k)s
TO BUY THIS EQUIPMENT.
I COULD NOT FIND INVESTORS
TO HELP ME BUILD MY DREAM,
SO I DID IT MYSELF.
I THOUGHT I'D BE
GIVING THE PRODUCT AWAY
FOR MARK, KEVIN,
AND MYSELF.
I THINK THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT DEAL.
LET'S DO IT.
DONE.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
GOING BACK TO THE BURGH!
YEAH.
[ LAUGHS ]
GOOD JOB.
