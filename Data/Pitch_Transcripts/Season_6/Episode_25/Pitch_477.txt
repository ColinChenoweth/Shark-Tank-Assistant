HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M SHERISSE HAWKINS.
AND I'M ALEX MILEWSKI.
WE ARE THE COFOUNDERS
OF BENEATH THE INK,
FROM BOULDER, COLORADO.
WE'RE SEEKING $350,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
WE'RE A DIGITAL-TEXT
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY
THAT SPARKS
READER CURIOSITY.
WE DO THIS BY EMBEDDING
RICH CURATED CONTENT
BENEATH THE INK
OF E-BOOKS.
WHEN YOU'RE READING SOMETHING
AND IT PIQUES YOUR INTEREST,
WHAT DO YOU DO?
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT A CHARACTER
OR HOW TO PRONOUNCE THEIR NAME,
WHO CAN YOU TURN TO?
AT BENEATH THE INK,
WE MAKE ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE
IN A WAY
THAT'S AMAZINGLY HELPFUL,
BLISSFULLY FREE OF THE INTERNET,
AND ELEGANTLY UNOBTRUSIVE.
LET ME SHOW YOU.
YOU'RE RELAXING
IN A CHAIR,
READING ONE OF
YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS,
"BENEATH A MARBLE SKY."
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU COME ACROSS A NAME
THAT YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT.
BECAUSE YOU'RE READING
A BENEATH THE INK EDITION,
YOU CAN SIMPLY TOUCH ON
THE GLOWING WORD TO LEARN MORE.
NOW YOU CAN GET TO KNOW
THIS CHARACTER.
WE CALL THESE EXTRAS "BINKS,"
OR "BENEATH THE INK LINKS,"
AND BINKS CAN CONTAIN
ALMOST ANYTHING.
THIS IS A BINK WITH A PICTURE
FROM AN ACTUAL PLACE
MENTIONED IN THE BOOK.
MAYBE YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN WHERE SOMETHING IS.
THIS BINK HAS A MAP.
YOU CAN EVEN ZOOM IN
AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
THIS PANORAMIC BINK SERVES
AS A WINDOW TO THE TAJ MAHAL.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY TURN YOUR
DEVICE AND EXPLORE THE SCENE,
AS IF YOU WERE
REALLY THERE.
BENEATH THE INK IS POISED
TO CHANGE HOW WE READ
AND MAKE E-READING
MORE IMMERSIVE AND EXCITING.
JOIN US ON OUR JOURNEY
BENEATH THE INK.
IT HAS TO BE
A BINK-ENABLED BOOK, RIGHT?
SO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
AN ANNOTATION PROCESS
FOR EACH BOOK,
WHICH HAS GOT TO BE
TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE.
EXPLAIN THE WHOLE ANNOTATION
AND INTEGRATION PROCESS.
SO, THE PRODUCT IS
AN ONLINE PORTAL.
AS AN AUTHOR,
YOU GO INTO THE PORTAL,
YOU UPLOAD
YOUR MANUSCRIPT,
AND THEN YOU DRAG AND DROP
CONTENT --
SO YOU MAKE THE AUTHOR
DO IT?
YEAH, THE CONTENT OWNER
DOES THE CURATING.
SO NOW I'M THE CONSUMER.
I BUY THE KINDLE,
OR WHATEVER THE READER IS.
DO I THEN LOG ON AND DOWNLOAD
YOUR VERSION OF IT?
YEAH.
SO, THAT'S THE BEST PART.
AS THE AUTHOR,
AT THE CLICK OF A BUTTON,
YOU CAN GET A VERSION
FOR ALL OF THE MAJOR
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS,
AND THEN, AS A READER,
I CAN GO TO MY FAVORITE CHANNEL.
SAY I'M ON
THE OLDEST KINDLE,
AND I CAN FIND
THE BENEATH THE INK EDITION
OF THAT BOOK
AND DOWNLOAD THAT.
AND WHERE DO YOU GET PAID?
THERE'S
THREE REVENUE STREAMS.
FIRST OF ALL,
WE HAVE A LICENSING MODEL
FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS
OR INSTITUTIONS THAT WANT TO DO
SEVERAL BENEATH TITLES.
WE ALSO HAVE
A SUBSCRIPTION MODEL.
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE
HYBRID AUTHORS
OR SELF-PUBLISHED AUTHORS,
ALEX, WHO'S PAYING YOU
THAT ROYALTY?
SO, THAT COMES FROM
THE CONTENT OWNER,
FROM EITHER THE PUBLISHER
OR THE AUTHOR.
O'Leary:
I'VE GOT THREE BOOKS OUT,
SO I'M INTRIGUED.
LET'S SAY I'M $14.95
ON MY UNBINKED BOOK.
AM I STILL $14.95 ON MY BINK?
NO.
SO, WE'VE DONE TWO
INDEPENDENT FOCUS-GROUP TESTS.
WHAT WE ASK IS, "WOULD YOU
PAY MORE FOR THIS CONTENT?"
98% OF THE USERS SAID
THEY WOULD PAY 10% TO 20% MORE
FOR THAT ENHANCED VERSION.
SO THEY'D PAY ANOTHER $2?
RIGHT.
Cuban: SO, THEN, LET'S JUST
TALK ABOUT YOUR COMPANY.
SINCE ALEX AND I MET.
I BROUGHT THE TEAM TOGETHER
AND RAISED OUR FIRST ROUND
OF FUNDING THROUGH
A CONVERTIBLE NOTE.
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE?
$640,000.
WOW!
O'Leary:
THE REAL DEAL HERE IS
IF YOU CAN BECOME A BRAND
SUPPORTED BY PUBLISHERS SAYING,
"IF I'M GONNA PUT IT OUT
ELECTRONICALLY AS AN E-BOOK,
IT'S GOT TO BE BINK."
THAT'S THE VISION.
THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS THING'S
GONNA BE WORTH ANYTHING.
I DISAGREE.
WHY?
HYBRID AUTHORS
AND SELF-PUBLISHING AUTHORS
ARE EXPLODING.
HOW MANY TITLES
ARE BINKED RIGHT NOW?
WE HAVE EIGHT TITLES
THAT ARE BINKED RIGHT NOW.
Herjavec: THAT'S IT?
UH, ALEX,
I THINK IT'S, UH,
A BRILLIANT IDEA.
UM...I REALLY DO.
BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
IT SEEMS SO SELF-EVIDENT --
IT HAS TO DRIVE
MORE BOOK SALES.
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO
SHARE IN THAT WITH ME.
NO. WE ABSOLUTELY
SHARE THAT.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
THE MONEY FOR.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Milewski: THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
Milewski: THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
THE WAY OF THE FUTURE.
WE CAN SEE IT AS CLEARLY
AS WE SAW THE SHARKS TODAY.
AND EVEN THOUGH
THEY MISSED OUT,
WE'RE STILL HEADING
IN THAT DIRECTION.
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.
WE'RE GONNA BINK MORE BOOKS.
WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH
MORE AUTHORS.
AND WE ARE GOING TO BE
THE GO-TO STANDARD
FOR ENHANCED BOOKS
IN THE FUTURE.
