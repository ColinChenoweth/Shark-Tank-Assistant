AND MY 18-MONTH-OLD
WAS COVERED IN MAC AND CHEESE.
WE WERE IN A QUIET RESTAURANT,
SO I KNEW IF I WIPED HER FACE,
SHE WOULD FUSS,
I'M EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT
ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS
GET TOGETHER EVERY MONTH.
MY ENTREPRENEURS SING.
[ LAUGHS ]
EVERY MONTH! AMAZING!
MAKE UP YOUR MIND!
THEY'RE ON QVC.
AY-YI-YI.
DON'T BE RUDE.
THEY ARE IN MY SHOW TOGETHER,
SO THEY'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER,
IT'S BEEN LESS THAN
FIVE MONTHS,
WE CHARGE $12 A MONTH
FOR THAT SUBSCRIPTION FEE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
SO, WE CONSIDER OURSELVES
PRE-REVENUE...
OF COURSE YOU DO.
...WHICH IS VERY, VERY COMMON
FOR STARTUPS AT THIS STAGE.
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR TWO YEARS,
MY NAME IS MONT HANDLEY, AND I'M
FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.
MY NAME IS MONT HANDLEY, AND I'M
FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.
YEAH!
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
I'M THE INVENTOR OF PittMoss,
FOR 8 TO 12 MONTHS
BEFORE WE HAD OUR FIRST SALES.
IT TOOK US TWO MONTHS
TO GET OUR FIRST SALES.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD SO FAR.
ABSOLUTELY.
WHERE'S THE BAD?
HE HASN'T GIVEN US
THE TOTAL YET.
THE BAD IS -- OH, $22,000
FOR THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS.
WHY ONLY $22,000?
WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK?
WHY DIDN'T THE ORDERS
KEEP COMING?
WE DO HAVE ORDERS.
WE HAVE $168,000
IN SALES AGREEMENTS RIGHT NOW.
BUT YOU CAN'T FILL THEM
BECAUSE OF CAPACITY?
WE CANNOT FILL THEM.
WHY?
CAPACITY. WE --
HOW MUCH CAN
THE EXISTING PLANT MAKE?
OH.
ANSWER THAT.
THE EXISTING PLANT
CAN MAKE
YOU HAVE $22,000 IN SEVEN MONTHS
IN SALES.
YES.
THAT'S A FACT.
YES, MA'AM.
THAT'S THE <i>ONLY</i> FACT
I SEE HERE.
EVERYTHING ELSE IS CONJECTURE,
PROJECTIONS.
IT'S NOT SEXY.
OKAY.
I'M OUT.
HOW MUCH DO YOU OWN
RIGHT NOW?
I CURRENTLY OWN
70% OF THE BUSINESS.
SO YOU'RE -- YOU'RE GONNA
SELL PAST CONTROL
JUST TO FINANCE
THE FIRST ROUND?
NOT QUITE.
IT'LL BE EQUAL --
NO, HE'S GONNA GET TO 51%.
NOT 51%.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
WELL, YOU ARE, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE MY $625,000,
THEN YOU'RE GONNA BRING IN
ANOTHER $400,000.
RIGHT, SO YOU'RE GETTING
PRETTY DARN CLOSE.
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT,
AND MONT STILL HAS NO OFFERS
FOR HIS PEAT MOSS ALTERNATIVE,
PittMoss.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO WALK AWAY FROM THE ANGELS
IF YOU GOT A DEAL HERE?
I...WOULD PROBABLY
BE WILLING TO DO THAT.
SO, I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH BARB.
I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU ONLY HAVE
$22,000 IN SALES
IN SEVEN MONTHS.
YES.
I THINK
THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM
IN THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LONG TIME TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
TO SWITCH OVER.
LORI --
SO IT WORRIES ME
TO INVEST IN YOUR COMPANY,
ON AN UNPROVEN MODEL,
WE DON'T KNOW
IF IT'LL CHANGE PEOPLE OVER,
CONGRATULATIONS, MONT.
YEAH. THANK YOU.
YOU REALLY KNOW
YOUR STUFF.
THANKS.
YEAH, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
O'Leary:
VERY INTERESTING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS, EVERYONE.
VERY INTERESTING.
Handley: THIS MEANS THAT I CAN
ACTUALLY MAKE A LIVING
BUILDING ON THE DREAM THAT I HAD
FOR 20 YEARS,
[ Voice breaking ] SO THAT'S --
THAT'S A REALLY AMAZING FEELING.
