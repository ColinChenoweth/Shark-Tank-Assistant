AND MY 18-MONTH-OLD
WAS COVERED IN MAC AND CHEESE.
WE WERE IN A QUIET RESTAURANT,
SO I KNEW IF I WIPED HER FACE,
SHE WOULD FUSS,
SO I ASKED MY HUSBAND
TO DIP HIS NAPKIN IN HIS WATER,
AND I BEGAN TO WIPE HER FACE,
AND SHE REACTED DIFFERENTLY.
SHE STARTED SAYING,
"NUMMY. MORE,"
BECAUSE IT WASN'T WATER
IN MY HUSBAND'S CUP --
IT WAS LEMONADE.
SO THAT'S WHEN THE IDEA OF
A FLAVORED FACE WIPE WAS BORN.
O'Leary: THAT'S FANTASTIC.
HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY OF THESE?
YEAH, SO, WE ARE
CURRENTLY APPROACHING
ALMOST 40
RETAIL LOCATIONS.
TWO OF THOSE LOCATIONS
ARE WALGREENS,
IN WHICH WE HAD
A 90-DAY TEST.
HOW DID IT DO
ON THE TEST?
WE ACTUALLY HAD A RAPID REORDER
WITHIN 30 DAYS.
OUR GOAL
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR
IS TO ROLL OUT REGIONALLY
WITH WALGREENS.
ALL RIGHT, SO, TELL US --
WHAT'S YOUR MARGINS, ET CETERA?
SO, WE MAKE IT
FOR 72 CENTS.
AND WHAT DO THEY
SELL IT FOR?
$3.99.
THAT'S PRICY.
W--WHAT -- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT FOR A WIPE.
WHAT IS THE COST
OF REGULAR WIPES?
THEY CAN GO AS LOW
AS $1.99.
OUCH.
IT SEEMS TO ME, THOUGH,
THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY
GET THIS PRICE DOWN.
ABSOLUTELY.
THIS IS BASED ON
LOW-VOLUME PRODUCTION,
SO WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING
THE PRICE DOWN
AT THE LARGER VOLUME...
TO WHAT?
...TO 53 CENTS.
THAT STILL DOESN'T LET YOU
MATCH AN EXISTING WIPE.
WE ARE
A PREMIUM-PRICE PRODUCT,
I'M EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT
AND GETTING
FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP AT NIGHT,
DOING EVERY SINGLE THING
IT TAKES,
AND IT'S NO JOKE
WHEN WE SAY
WE BARELY SLEEP,
'CAUSE WE ARE MANAGING BOTH.
I BELIEVE YOU.
NO, I GET IT,
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS,
I THINK ONE THING
AND ONE THING ONLY --
"WILL THEY GET
THEIR PATENT?"
SO I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER
CONTINGENT ON YOU
GETTING THE PATENT, OKAY?
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 30%.
I THINK WE NEED TO HIT
BUY BUY BABY, TOYS "R" US.
I HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH A LOT
OF THE MAJOR STORES OUT THERE
THAT I THINK
WOULD CARRY THIS PRODUCT.
BUT I'D LIKE TO MOVE FAST.
'CAUSE I JUST THOUGHT
OF AN ANGLE ON THIS
THAT I THINK IT'S MISSING.
CAN YOU MAKE
A CHERRY FLAVOR?
YEAH.
THEN I'M GONNA MAKE AN OFFER
CONTINGENT ON ONLY ONE THING.
I'M GONNA MAKE IT BASED ON
YOU MAKING A CHERRY FLAVOR.
AND I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A SWEETER DEAL THAN LORI,
WHO'S BEING A LITTLE CHEAP
TODAY, ALL RIGHT?
I'M GONNA MAKE AN OFFER
OF $150,000 FOR 20%.
Cuban:
JUST WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR.
WOW.
WHOA! HOLD IT,
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
I MADE A MISTAKE.
[ LAUGHS ]
SHOCKING.
I'M GONNA MAKE AN OFFER
OF $150,000 FOR 25%.
OKAY. THE REASON --
Greiner: WELL, HERE, LET ME
CHANGE SOMETHING FOR YOU,
'CAUSE I REALLY
BELIEVE IN YOU.
WHAT'S THE NEW DEAL?
I'M GOING TO OFFER YOU
$150,000 FOR 25%, AS WELL,
CONTINGENT ON THE PATENT.
WE DO VALUE YOU AND YOUR
RESOURCES AND YOUR EXPERTISE,
ESPECIALLY IN
THE PATENT WORLD.
IS IT HARD CONTINGENCY
ON THE PATENT?
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO CONCERN THAT
WE'RE GONNA GET IT APPROVED,
BASED ON --
Greiner:
I WILL PUT THIS WAY.
IF EVERYTHING THAT YOU TOLD ME
IS SO, I'M GOOD.
I'LL PULL THE CONTINGENCY
ON THE PATENT,
BECAUSE I'M TRUSTING YOU
THAT YOU SAY IT'S COMING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT,
ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS
GET TOGETHER EVERY MONTH.
MY ENTREPRENEURS SING.
[ LAUGHS ]
EVERY MONTH! AMAZING!
MAKE UP YOUR MIND!
THEY'RE ON QVC.
AY-YI-YI.
DON'T BE RUDE.
THEY ARE IN MY SHOW TOGETHER,
SO THEY'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER,
AND THEY'RE
ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.
MY FiberFix, SCRUB DADDY,
DROP STOP.
STOP.
AND SEVERAL OF THEM MAKE
PACKAGING FOR EACH OTHER.
I HAVE ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS
TO MY DINNER TABLE
WITH MY CHILDREN.
STOP! STOP!
WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.
STOP!
COME ON, GIRLS, LET'S GO.
CHOP-CHOP. LET'S GO.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
WE APPRECIATE
ALL OFFERS,
UM, AND I THINK
WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO
IS TAKE BARBARA'S OFFER.
I THINK YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
CONGRATULATIONS.
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'M NOT A SORE LOSER.
CONGRATULATIONS.
DON'T GLOAT. DON'T GLOAT.
DON'T GLOAT. DON'T GLOAT.
ALL RIGHT, I WON'T GLOAT.
DON'T GLOAT.
I'M SO SORRY, LORI.
I'M SO SORRY, LORI.
DON'T BE A SORE WINNER.
NO, IT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M HAPPY YOU GUYS
MADE A DEAL.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU!
THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M SO EXCITED.
GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BARBARA AND LORI
ARE BOTH AMAZING,
BUT WE JUST FELT LIKE
BARBARA, I THINK,
WAS MORE ALIGNED WITH
OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
MOVING FORWARD,
AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHERE
SHE CAN HELP US TAKE THE BRAND.
Narrator:
EARLIER THIS SEASON,
WE SAW DAYMOND JOHN MAKE A DEAL
WITH SUN-STACHES,
A NOVELTY-SUNGLASSES COMPANY.
WE WANT TO GROW TO
MORE LICENSING -- MARVEL, DC.
John: I CAN HELP YOU
GET THE LICENSES YOU NEED,
AND THAT WILL SAVE YOU
A LOT OF MONEY.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
WHAT'S UP?
HEY, HEY, WHAT'S UP?
Man: THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING,
PARTNERING WITH DAYMOND.
IT'S BEEN LESS THAN
FIVE MONTHS,
AND WE'VE ALREADY SOLD
$4.1 MILLION.
GUYS, THIS IS MARVEL.
YOU READY?
LET'S GO.
John: AS SOON AS
WE DID OUR DEAL,
I CALLED MY FRIENDS AT MARVEL
AND SECURED A LICENSING DEAL
FOR SUN-STACHES.
PAUL!
DAYMOND,
HOW ARE YOU?
MARVEL IS ONE
OF THE WORLD'S MOST PROMINENT
CHARACTER-BASED
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES.
THEY HAVE A LIBRARY
OF MORE THAN 8,000 CHARACTERS.
THAT MEANS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY
FOR SUN-STACHES.
WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT THE FIRST
SET OF MARVEL SUN-STACHES
TO SHOW YOU GUYS.
THE WAY THE DEAL WORKS
IS WE DESIGN,
MANUFACTURE,
AND SELL TO RETAILERS,
AND WE PAY MARVEL A ROYALTY
ON ALL THAT WE SELL.
THESE ARE GREAT, GUYS.
THESE ARE REALLY EXCELLENT.
MARVEL IS OWNED
BY THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY,
SO THE SYNERGY THAT WE CAN BUILD
BETWEEN OUR BRANDS IS LIMITLESS.
I DON'T EVEN NEED
TO WISH YOU GUYS LUCK.
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Man:
SMALL COMPANIES LIKE OURS
DON'T JUST MAKE DEALS
WITH DISNEY.
WE TRIED TO GET
A DEAL WITH MARVEL
BEFORE WE WENT ON "SHARK TANK,"
AND WE GOT TURNED DOWN.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
TOGETHER. THANK YOU.
ABSOLUTELY.
Man: "SHARK TANK" HAS CHANGED
OUR ENTIRE BUSINESS.
IT'S NOT JUST OUR BRAND.
IT'S SUN-STACHES
ALONGSIDE MARVEL.
IT'S AMAZING.
GREAT JOB.
John: I'M EXCITED TO BE PART
OF THIS RIDE, AS WELL.
THIS IS THE POWER
OF "SHARK TANK."
THIS IS ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AT ITS BEST.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS AN INNOVATION
TO MAKE A DANGEROUS JOB
MUCH SAFER.
WE CHARGE $12 A MONTH
FOR THAT SUBSCRIPTION FEE.
AND THEN WE HAVE AN EXPORT FEE
THAT'S $199 PER CHANNEL.
SO, A TYPICAL BOOK
THAT IS GONNA GET BINKED
WOULD COST HOW MUCH
TO THE AUTHOR?
LESS THAN $1,000.
WE TAKE A ROYALTY SHARE
ON EACH TITLE SOLD,
AND THAT MEANS THAT
THE UP-FRONT COST FOR THE AUTHOR
CAN BE LESS, BECAUSE --
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
SO, WE CONSIDER OURSELVES
PRE-REVENUE...
OF COURSE YOU DO.
...WHICH IS VERY, VERY COMMON
FOR STARTUPS AT THIS STAGE.
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR TWO YEARS,
MY NAME IS MONT HANDLEY, AND I'M
FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.
MY PRODUCT IS PittMoss, AND IT'S
A REPLACEMENT FOR PEAT MOSS.
PEAT MOSS
IS A NATURAL SOIL ADDITIVE
THAT'S COMMONLY USED
BY HOME GARDENERS,
COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSES,
AND NURSERIES.
IT HELPS PLANTS RETAIN WATER
AND GROW FASTER.
THE PROBLEM
WITH HARVESTING PEAT MOSS --
IT HAS TERRIBLE
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES.
AND AS PEATLANDS AROUND
THE WORLD ARE BEING DRAINED,
THEY RELEASE
AS MUCH AS 1 BILLION TONS
OF CARBON POLLUTION
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE EVERY YEAR.
THAT IS NEARLY 8%
OF ALL ANNUAL CARBON POLLUTION.
IF WE DON'T START
CONSERVING PEATLANDS NOW,
OUR PLANET COULD BE
IN BIG TROUBLE.
BUT MY PRODUCT, PittMoss,
OFFERS A GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE
ALTERNATIVE TO PEAT MOSS.
IT'S MADE
FROM RECYCLED NEWSPAPER,
AND IT WOULD OTHERWISE END UP
IN A LANDFILL.
THIS BUSINESS
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS.
IT'S ABOUT DOING SOMETHING
COLLECTIVELY GOOD
FOR THE PLANET.
IT'S ABOUT BUILDING A BUSINESS
AND REALIZING
YOU CAN STILL ACHIEVE
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
I HOPE THE SHARKS SEE
THAT WHAT I'M DOING IS IMPORTANT
AND ALLOW ME
TO KEEP MY DREAM ALIVE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MONT HANDLEY, AND I'M
FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.
YEAH!
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
I'M THE INVENTOR OF PittMoss,
AND I'M HERE TO OFFER YOU
25% EQUITY
FOR A $600,000 INVESTMENT
IN MY MANUFACTURING COMPANY.
PittMoss IS A SOIL ALTERNATIVE
THAT'S GOING TO GREEN UP
THE LANDSCAPING
AND GARDENING INDUSTRY.
SHARKS, WALK THROUGH
ANY RETAIL GARDEN CENTER,
FOR 8 TO 12 MONTHS
BEFORE WE HAD OUR FIRST SALES.
IT TOOK US TWO MONTHS
TO GET OUR FIRST SALES.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD SO FAR.
ABSOLUTELY.
WHERE'S THE BAD?
HE HASN'T GIVEN US
THE TOTAL YET.
THE BAD IS -- OH, $22,000
FOR THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS.
WHY ONLY $22,000?
WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK?
WHY DIDN'T THE ORDERS
KEEP COMING?
WE DO HAVE ORDERS.
WE HAVE $168,000
IN SALES AGREEMENTS RIGHT NOW.
BUT YOU CAN'T FILL THEM
BECAUSE OF CAPACITY?
WE CANNOT FILL THEM.
WHY?
CAPACITY. WE --
HOW MUCH CAN
THE EXISTING PLANT MAKE?
OH.
ANSWER THAT.
THE EXISTING PLANT
CAN MAKE
ABOUT 200 TONS A YEAR,
AND WE NEED TO --
AND HOW MUCH IS THAT
IN REVENUE?
UM, $60,000.
YOU KNEW GOING IN
THAT THE SIZE OF THE FACTORY
YOU WERE BUILDING
WOULD ONLY PRODUCE $60,000
OF TOP-LINE PRODUCT?
I ONLY BUILT THE FACTORY
TO PROVE MY CONCEPT.
OH, SO THE ENTIRE THING
WAS JUST A PROOF OF CONCEPT.
IN MY MIND, THAT'S WHAT
I BELIEVED I WAS DOING.
WHAT ABOUT THE PATH
OF RESISTANCE TO SELLING IT?
TO CHANGE THE PURCHASE BEHAVIOR
OF GROWERS IS A CHALLENGE.
WE ACTUALLY DON'T
SEE THAT, KEVIN.
WE ACTUALLY SEE GROWERS
WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO LOYALTY
TO PEAT MOSS -- NONE.
I'M GROWING TOMATOES.
I DO $2 MILLION
IN TOMATOES,
AND I USE PEAT MOSS.
YOU COME TO ME AND SAY,
"I FINALLY GOT THE PLANT GOING.
I'VE GOT THE $500,000
FROM MR. WONDERFUL.
I'M READY TO ROCK HERE."
AND THAT PERSON WILL SAY,
"THIS IS GREAT.
I HAVE NO RESISTANCE
TO SWITCHING OVER."
IS THAT TRUE?
WHAT HE'S GONNA DO --
HE'S GONNA GROW MAYBE 10%
OF HIS CROPS IN OUR PRODUCT
TO PROVE THAT IT WORKS.
WHY? BUT YOU --
WHY? 'CAUSE HE'S NERVOUS
ABOUT DOING IT.
ABSOLUTELY.
WOULDN'T YOU BE?
WHAT IS YOUR STRATEGY,
THOUGH?
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SERVICE GREENHOUSES?
ARE YOU TRYING TO SELL THIS
TO THE CONSUMER?
ARE YOU TRYING TO SELL IT
TO FARMERS?
YES.
OR ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO ALL THREE?
WE THINK WE CAN SCALE
BY GOING WITH THE COMMERCIAL
GROWERS FIRST...
COMMERCIAL FIRST.
...AND ACTUALLY BRAND THE PLANTS
SO THAT WE CAN GET INTO
THE RETAIL SPACE
WITH THE PLANTS,
THE PittMoss-GROWN PLANTS.
HOW DO YOU GET
TO THE GREENHOUSES?
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRODUCT
IS, WHAT ARE YOU GIVING THEM?
WE GIVE THEM
A UNIT OF PRODUCT,
A 50-CUBIC-FOOT UNIT
OF PRODUCT,
AND LET THEM PLAY WITH IT,
WITH ALL THEIR DIFFERENT CROPS
THAT THEY'LL USE --
THEY'LL GROW IN ONE SEASON.
Herjavec: HERE'S WHAT
I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND.
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH IT?
I MEAN,
IT'S SO CREATIVE.
ROBERT, I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED
IN COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSES,
AND DON'T ASK ME WHY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT SINCE I WAS
A LITTLE KID.
WHEN I BOUGHT MY
FIRST GREENHOUSE WHEN
I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.
MY PARENTS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I DID IT,
AND MY MOTHER WAS LIKE,
"I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SOLD A GREENHOUSE
TO A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY."
MY FIRST JOB OUT OF COLLEGE
WAS MANAGING FIVE LOCATIONS
OF A RETAIL NURSERY, AND THAT'S
WHERE I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA.
I TURNED 50 THIS YEAR,
AND I SAID TO MYSELF,
"IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS NOW,
YOU WILL NEVER DO IT."
AND THAT'S WHY I SAID,
"YOU HAVE TO DO THIS."
AND I'M FLYING BACK
TO PITTSBURGH IN TWO DAYS
TO CLOSE A DEAL
WITH BlueTree ALLIED ANGELS.
THEY'RE AN ANGEL
INVESTMENT GROUP.
O'Leary:
HOW MUCH -- WHAT VAL--
'CAUSE YOU PUT A VALUE OF THIS
OF $2.4 MILLION.
THAT'S CORRECT.
AND YOU BASICALLY HAVE MARGINAL
SALES -- PRACTICALLY NOTHING.
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
A CREDIBLE GROUP OF INVESTORS
WHO ARE ACCEPTING
OF THAT VALUATION.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA
RAISE FROM THEM?
WE HAVE A COMMITMENT WITH THEM
FOR $400,000
IN CONVERTIBLE NOTES.
IN THE PLANT
THAT YOU HAVE NOW...
YES.
...HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
TO MAX OUT YOUR PLANT?
$120,000.
HOW MUCH REVENUE
WILL THAT GENERATE IN ONE YEAR
IF YOU SELL OUT 100% OF IT
AT YOUR LOWEST COST --
TO YOUR
LOWEST-PRICE CUSTOMER?
$1.6 MILLION.
OKAY, SO,
FOR A COST OF $240,000,
YOU CAN HAVE TWO LINES.
RIGHT.
THAT WILL GIVE YOU
AN APPROXIMATE REVENUE CAPACITY
FOR THAT PLANT
OF $3.2 MILLION.
THAT'S CORRECT.
LET ME CLEAR THE FIELD.
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO SPEAK.
WAIT, BARBARA, YOU SH--
NO.
I JUST WANT
TO CLEAR THE FIELD.
SURE.
ALL RIGHT.
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT,
YOU HAVE $22,000 IN SEVEN MONTHS
IN SALES.
YES.
THAT'S A FACT.
YES, MA'AM.
THAT'S THE <i>ONLY</i> FACT
I SEE HERE.
EVERYTHING ELSE IS CONJECTURE,
PROJECTIONS.
IT'S NOT SEXY.
OKAY.
I'M OUT.
HOW MUCH DO YOU OWN
RIGHT NOW?
I CURRENTLY OWN
70% OF THE BUSINESS.
SO YOU'RE -- YOU'RE GONNA
SELL PAST CONTROL
JUST TO FINANCE
THE FIRST ROUND?
NOT QUITE.
IT'LL BE EQUAL --
NO, HE'S GONNA GET TO 51%.
NOT 51%.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
WELL, YOU ARE, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE MY $625,000,
THEN YOU'RE GONNA BRING IN
ANOTHER $400,000.
RIGHT, SO YOU'RE GETTING
PRETTY DARN CLOSE.
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND.
SO, WHAT HE'S SAYING IS,
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO WALK AWAY FROM THE ANGELS
IF YOU GOT A DEAL HERE?
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT,
AND MONT STILL HAS NO OFFERS
FOR HIS PEAT MOSS ALTERNATIVE,
PittMoss.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO WALK AWAY FROM THE ANGELS
IF YOU GOT A DEAL HERE?
I...WOULD PROBABLY
BE WILLING TO DO THAT.
SO, I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH BARB.
I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU ONLY HAVE
$22,000 IN SALES
IN SEVEN MONTHS.
YES.
I THINK
THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM
IN THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LONG TIME TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
TO SWITCH OVER.
LORI --
SO IT WORRIES ME
TO INVEST IN YOUR COMPANY,
ON AN UNPROVEN MODEL,
WE DON'T KNOW
IF IT'LL CHANGE PEOPLE OVER,
AND IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE
AT THE MOMENT,
YOU'RE STRUGGLING
TO DO THAT.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONSIDERATION.
I WILL TELL YOU
THAT THIS IS NOT A FAD.
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN,
BECAUSE THERE ARE ALREADY
GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD
WHO ARE BANNING THE USE
OF PEAT MOSS IN HORTICULTURE.
KEVIN.
THE UNITED KINGDOM
HAS ALREADY SET VOLUNTARY DATES.
WAIT, WAIT, LET ME -- WAIT,
WAIT, LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT IT.
I'VE GOT AN OFFER.
I'VE GOT AN OFFER.
KEVIN, KEVIN, KEVIN, KEVIN.
LET ME GO.
LET ME MAKE AN OFFER.
LET'S SEE WHAT HE SAYS.
I'M NOT WILLING TO GO IN
ON $600,000 --
JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT IT --
BUT I WANT TO PARTICIPATE,
SO I'M NOT...
DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO GO IN
ON IT? I'LL PUT UP $200,000.
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK,
THERE'S TREMENDOUS VALUE
IN GETTING ONE OR MORE SHARKS
VERSUS YOUR ANGEL INVESTORS.
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
I AGREE WITH THAT.
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU
$600,000.
THERE MAY BE OTHER PARTICIPANTS
IN THAT,
BUT I'M WILLING TO MAKE YOU
AN OFFER OF $600,000 FOR 40%.
UM, I THINK YOU JUST
DEVALUED MY VALUATION
PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY.
I -- I'M OPEN TO --
WELL, GIVE ME A COUNTER.
I'M INTERESTED IN
YOUR BUSINESS.
I'M OPEN TO A DIFFERENT
VALUATION. SURE.
I MIGHT GO AS HIGH
AS 30%.
I THINK IF YOU GO TO 35%,
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
OKAY, I'LL -- J-- BEFORE --
LET'S GET SOME THINGS ON
THE TABLE, HERE, FIRST.
SO IF YOU LIKE
THE PERCENTAGES, RIGHT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT'S GONNA GET JUICY.
KEVIN AND I HAVE THOUGHT,
FOR SURE.
ROBERT, I DON'T THINK
WE'D HAVE A PROBLEM
IF THE THREE OF US
WENT IN TOGETHER.
UM...
OH, I'M IN.
LET'S GO.
$600,000 FOR 35%
CONGRATULATIONS, MONT.
YEAH. THANK YOU.
YOU REALLY KNOW
YOUR STUFF.
THANKS.
YEAH, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
O'Leary:
VERY INTERESTING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS, EVERYONE.
VERY INTERESTING.
Handley: THIS MEANS THAT I CAN
ACTUALLY MAKE A LIVING
BUILDING ON THE DREAM THAT I HAD
FOR 20 YEARS,
[ Voice breaking ] SO THAT'S --
THAT'S A REALLY AMAZING FEELING.
[ SNIFFLES ]
