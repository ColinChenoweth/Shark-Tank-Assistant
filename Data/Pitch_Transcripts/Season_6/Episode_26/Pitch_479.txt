HI, SHARKS.
I'M BRITTANY HODACK.
BRITTANY, HOW DID YOU --
HOW DID YOU COME TOGETHER?
THE TWO OF US MET
IN LATE 2010.
WE WERE WORKING AT AN
ADVERTISING AGENCY IN NEW YORK.
THE IDEA FOR ZinePak WAS
ONE THAT I HAD IN COLLEGE.
I WAS INTERNING
FOR A MAJOR RECORD COMPANY,
Kaupe: FOR US, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE A DYING THING,
BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPER FANS
OUT THERE FOR EVERYTHING.
THAT'S WHY WHOLE COMPANIES
LIKE COMIC-CON EXIST,
BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE --
NASCAR, FORMULA 1.
BRITTANY, YOU'RE AT 14%.
WE'RE AT 20%.
JUST OFFER THEM MORE MONEY.
WE WILL MEET YOU
IN THE MIDDLE
AT 17.5%.
DON'T DO IT.
LET US CONFER, PLEASE.
YES.
[ Laughing ] ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE WITH YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE EXCITED.
WOW. YOU GUYS DID
AN AMAZING JOB.
Greiner:
YOUR WORK IS BEAUTIFUL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANKS, GUYS.
NOW, SHE IS SOLID.
Greiner: I THINK THEY WERE --
I THINK YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
I THINK YOU DID A GOOD DEAL,
EXCEPT YOU OVERPAID
TWO YEARS AHEAD.
KEVIN.
ADMIT IT -- YOU CAN'T
GET IT RIGHT EVERY TIME.
John: I DON'T
THINK YOU OVERPAID.
LORI, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY SAY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THE DEAL WE MADE.
IT WAS A LITTLE MORE EQUITY
THAN WE WANTED TO GIVE UP.
BUT FOR TWO SHARKS,
IT WAS A GAME WELL PLAYED.
