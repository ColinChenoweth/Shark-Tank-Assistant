HI, SHARKS.
I'M BRITTANY HODACK.
AND I'M KIM KAUPE.
AND WE'RE ENTERTAINMENT
SUPER FANS
FROM NEW YORK, NEW YORK.
TODAY, WE'RE HERE
SEEKING $725,000
FOR A 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY, ZinePak.
WOW.
WHOA.
SUPER FANS ARE
EVERYWHERE.
THEY PAINT THEIR FACES
ON GAME DAY,
HEAD TO MIDNIGHT MOVIE PREMIERES
IN COSTUME,
AND THEY'VE SEEN
THEIR FAVORITE BAND
PLAY LIVE 37 TIMES.
OUR PRODUCT, ZinePaks,
SPEAK TO THIS AUDIENCE
WITH THE ULTIMATE
FAN COLLECTIBLE --
EXCLUSIVE MERCHANDISE
AND MAGAZINES AND MUSIC.
OUR ZinePaks HAVE CAUGHT
THE ATTENTION
OF SOME PRETTY BIG STARS.
OUR CLIENTS INCLUDE KATY PERRY,
BRAD PAISLEY,
KISS,
AND FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE,
JUST TO NAME A FEW.
BUT NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP TO
EXPAND BEYOND THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
SO THAT SUPER FANS EVERYWHERE
CAN HAVE ZinePak PRODUCTS
FOR THE MOVIES, VIDEO GAMES,
AND TEAMS THEY LOVE.
OUR PRODUCTS ARE
BEST APPRECIATED UP CLOSE.
IN ADDITION TO SOME OF
OUR FAVORITE PRODUCTS,
YOU GUYS WILL FIND
A SURPRISE INSIDE
THAT YOU
JUST MIGHT LIKE.
Greiner: THERE'S A LOT
OF SURPRISES HERE.
OHH! I LOVE THIS BOOK.
[ CHUCKLES ]
IS THIS A MAGNET?
THOSE ARE TRADING CARDS.
TRADING CARDS.
YOU EACH HAVE YOUR OWN
COLLECTIBLE TRADING CARD.
WHY -- WHY DON'T YOU WALK US
THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS MODEL.
SO, LIKE A LOT OF START-UPS,
WE'RE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING.
OKAY.
WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE COMPANY
3 1/2 YEARS AGO,
THE PROBLEM THAT WE WERE
TRYING TO SOLVE WAS REALLY
HOW TO MAKE PHYSICAL MUSIC
TANGIBLE AND RELEVANT.
AND OUR INSIGHT
WAS THAT PHYSICAL MUSIC
ISN'T SUPERIOR
TO DIGITAL MUSIC.
WHY WOULD YOU GET IN YOUR CAR,
DRIVE TO THE STORE, BUY A CD,
IF YOU WEREN'T GETTING
ANYTHING THAT WAS BETTER
THAT YOU COULD JUST DOWNLOAD
ON YOUR COMPUTER
OR STREAM ONLINE?
SO YOU WERE TRYING TO SUPPORT
THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHYSICAL CDs
WITH ADDITIONAL CONTENT?
YES.
YEAH, SO IF YOU'RE --
OKAY, SO JUST TELL US HOW --
TELL US YOUR MODEL...
YEAH, TELL US HOW IT WORKS,
HOW YOU MAKE MONEY.
...WHERE YOUR REVENUES ARE,
HOW YOU MAKE MONEY, ET CETERA.
SURE.
YEAH, SO, WHEN AN ARTIST
IS PUTTING OUT AN ALBUM
OR DOING A TOUR
OR ANYTHING,
THEY COME TO US AND SAY,
"WE WANT TO CONNECT
WITH OUR SUPER FANS
IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY ENGAGING
AND ON OUR TERMS."
SO, IF YOU GUYS WILL
LOOK AT THE BRAD PAISLEY
SAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE --
THIS IS BRAD'S ALBUM RELEASE
THAT CAME OUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO.
SO...
Herjavec: AND WHERE DOES
THIS COME? DOES IT --
THIS IS IN WALMART.
OH, IT HAS THE RECORD
RIGHT IN IT?
Hodack: YEAH. SO, THIS IS
THE DELUXE PACKAGING.
Herjavec:
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.
ALL RIGHT, SO, TELL ME YOUR
SALES FOR THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
WELL, YEAR-TO-DATE,
WE'RE A LITTLE OVER $3 MILLION.
OUR ZinePak PRODUCTS,
SINCE WE LAUNCHED
3 1/2 YEARS AGO --
JUST OVER $30 MILLION
IN WALMART STORES.
WOW.
SO, A MUSIC PRODUCT,
AS YOU GUYS KNOW, IS 100% --
SO, YOU'RE BASICALLY
A PACKAGING AGENCY, RIGHT?
THEY'RE AN AGENCY.
WE ALSO DO
A LOT MORE THAN THAT.
SO, FOR THE FIRST
COUPLE OF YEARS,
WE WERE JUST FOCUSED
ON SOLVING THIS PROBLEM
OF HOW DO WE MAKE
MUSIC RELEVANT AT WALMART.
AND OUR CELEBRITY CLIENTS
CAME BACK TO US AND SAID,
"WE LOVE WORKING WITH YOU,
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER ALBUM FOR TWO YEARS.
SO, WHAT CAN WE DO
IN THE MEANTIME?"
SO, THAT'S WHEN
WE STARTED EXPANDING,
AND ALL THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT
YOU GUYS SEE IN FRONT OF YOU
CAME OUT OF THAT INSIGHT,
SO --
BRITTANY, HOW DID YOU --
HOW DID YOU COME TOGETHER?
THE TWO OF US MET
IN LATE 2010.
WE WERE WORKING AT AN
ADVERTISING AGENCY IN NEW YORK.
THE IDEA FOR ZinePak WAS
ONE THAT I HAD IN COLLEGE.
I WAS INTERNING
FOR A MAJOR RECORD COMPANY,
AND EVERY INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
WOULD SAY,
"NOBODY'S BUYING
PHYSICAL MUSIC."
AND I THOUGHT,
"WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
NOBODY'S MAKING PHYSICAL MUSIC
SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING ELSE."
AND I WORKED AT A COUPLE
OF OTHER RECORD COMPANIES
AFTER I GRADUATED,
AND NOBODY LIKED THIS IDEA.
[ LAUGHS ]
I WAS ACTUALLY TOLD
BY MY BOSS AT ONE POINT,
"I DON'T PAY YOU
TO HAVE IDEAS.
I PAY YOU TO IMPLEMENT
THE IDEAS I GIVE YOU."
AND I MET KIM.
Kaupe: [ LAUGHS ]
AND KIM HAD SIMILAR FRUSTRATIONS
FROM THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY,
AND WE SAID,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF WE DO THIS TOGETHER,
WITH MY BACKGROUND IN MUSIC
AND YOUR BACKGROUND
IN PUBLISHING,
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
PULL THIS THING OFF."
SO, YOU GUYS HAVE GOT
AN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP
WITH WALMART, RIGHT?
WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE
WITH WALMART
ON THE ZinePak
CONFIGURATION,
SO THE BRAD PAISLEY PACKAGE
THAT YOU'RE HOLDING,
THAT'S A WALMART PRODUCT.
OKAY.
NONE OF THE OTHER PRODUCT
ON THE TABLE IS WALMART PRODUCT.
SO, WE'VE GROWN
OUTSIDE OF RETAIL,
AND WE'VE GROWN
INTO TICKETING.
THE LITTLE, SMALL TICKET THAT
YOU GUYS HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU...
Herjavec: THIS ONE?
YES.
...THAT WAS THE TICKET
TO MUMFORD &amp; SONS'
TOUR LAST SUMMER.
SO, WE CUSTOMIZED
ALL 140,000 TICKETS.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
IT'S EVER BEEN DONE
ON SUCH
A LARGE SCALE BEFORE.
I JUST WANT TO
POINT SOMETHING OUT
ABOUT TRYING TO VALUE
WHAT YOU'RE WORTH TODAY.
YOU HAVE A MASSIVE RISK,
'CAUSE YOU HAVE ONE CUSTOMER.
LIKE, WHY AREN'T YOU TALKING
ABOUT BEST BUY AND TARGET
AND OTHER CUSTOMERS
TO DIVERSIFY YOUR REVENUE?
BECAUSE BEST BUY
AND TARGET SALES TOGETHER
IN MUSIC DON'T EQUAL
WHAT WALMART SELLS.
[ ALL TALKING ]
BAM! [ CHUCKLES ]
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
ABOUT OUR GROWTH --
WE TURN DOWN
ABOUT 50% OF THE PEOPLE
WHO COME TO US
ASKING FOR BUSINESS,
BECAUSE WE WANT TO
KEEP IT EXCLUSIVE.
WE WANT TO BE A PRODUCT
THAT'S JUST FOR SUPER FANS.
ALL RIGHT, I MEAN,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER
IN TERMS OF WHAT
I THINK IT'S WORTH, OKAY?
[ CHUCKLING ]
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH, KEVIN?
UM, I WOULD DO
THE $725,000 FOR 35%.
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
AND THAT'S BASICALLY
WHAT A VENTURE FIRM
WOULD GIVE YOU TODAY.
OTHERWISE, IT'S NOT COMMENSURATE
WITH THE RISK I'M TAKING.
WELL, WE DON'T SEE IT
AS A RISK,
BECAUSE, AS WE SAID,
WE'RE WORKING TO DO
MORE AND MORE OF OUR BUSINESS
OUTSIDE OF WALMART.
THE WALMART RELATIONSHIP
HAS BEEN AMAZING,
BECAUSE OUR HISTORY
IN 3 1/2 YEARS WITH WALMART
HAS ALLOWED US TO WORK WITH
75 DIFFERENT AMAZING ARTISTS.
THAT'S PHENOMENAL, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
YOU'VE GOT TO DIVERSIFY.
WHAT DO YOU PROJECT YOUR SALES
TO BE NEXT YEAR?
$8 MILLION.
SO, WHY DO YOU NEED US?
SO, WE FEEL
VERY CONFIDENT
ABOUT OUR ABILITY
IN THE MUSIC SPACE.
WE'VE BEEN LIVING IT AND
BREATHING IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
WHERE WE ARE
GOING TO NEED HELP
IS AS WE GROW
INTO OTHER VERTICALS.
SO, WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN
AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR SPORTS.
AND, LOOK, I SEE WHAT
YOU GUYS ARE DOING. IT'S GREAT.
BUT I ALSO SEE
THE DESPERATION SIDE, TOO.
THE CHALLENGE IS
IT'S A DECLINING INDUSTRY,
AS YOU KNOW -- PHYSICAL CDs --
AND YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT,
AND YOU'RE LOOKING TO COMPLEMENT
ALL YOUR OTHER AREAS.
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY GIVEN US A
STRATEGY TO GET BEYOND WALMART.
I JUST --
I DON'T SEE THE FUTURE YET.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
Kaupe: FOR US, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE A DYING THING,
BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPER FANS
OUT THERE FOR EVERYTHING.
THAT'S WHY WHOLE COMPANIES
LIKE COMIC-CON EXIST,
BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE --
NASCAR, FORMULA 1.
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE STILL BUILT
AROUND PHYSICAL, RIGHT?
AND YOU'RE SAYING THEY WANT
TO HAVE SOMETHING PHYSICAL?
WE'RE GIVING PEOPLE SOMETHING
TO HOLD AND SOMETHING TO LOVE.
THAT'S BECAUSE SUPER FANS
LIKE TO HOLD IT.
John: OKAY, GUYS. LET ME --
LET ME -- LET ME HELP.
SO...
LISTEN, HERE, I'M GONNA TAKE
A FLIER WITH YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $725,000
FOR 30%.
THANK YOU
FOR THE OFFER.
LADIES, YOU DID
AN AMAZING JOB TODAY.
I GET IT RIGHT AWAY, AND I GET
THE EXTENSION TO THE SUPER FAN.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT SOME
OF THE OTHER SHARKS ARE MISSING.
I GET IT, TOO.
I ALMOST THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES WHEN SOMETHING,
LIKE, JUST SEEMS TO GO AWAY,
SOME PEOPLE START
TO REALLY MISS IT MORE
AND WANT SOMETHING TANGIBLE --
AND EXCLUSIVE.
A KEEPSAKE.
EXACTLY.
YEAH.
I LOVE SUPPORTING GREAT,
SMART WOMEN.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
I WOULD LIKE, THOUGH,
TO HAVE ROBERT COME IN WITH ME.
WE WOULD GIVE YOU $725,000
FOR 20%.
I'M HAPPY TO GO ALONG
WITH LORI.
I THINK
SHE'S THE RIGHT PARTNER.
I THINK WE BRING
DIFFERENT THINGS TO IT.
I'LL GO DOWN TO 25%.
SO, 25% FROM DAYMOND, WITH 20%
BETWEEN ROBERT AND LORI.
I'M $725,000 FOR 35%.
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE WORTH.
I'M SORRY.
AND I JUST
WANT TO CLARIFY --
OUR SALES WILL BE CLOSE
TO $4 MILLION THIS YEAR.
THAT $3 MILLION IS
OUR YEAR-TO-DATE.
I WILL ADJUST DOWN TO 30%,
THEN, IF THAT'S TRUE.
OH, YOU'RE SO GENEROUS.
THOSE ARE SERIOUS OFFERS.
THAT'S A LOT OF CASH
IN THE SHARK TANK.
WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS GONNA DO?
Narrator:
ONE SHARK IS OUT.
KIM AND BRITTANY
HAVE THREE OFFERS
FROM THE OTHER FOUR SHARKS
FOR THEIR CREATIVE-PACKAGING
COMPANY, ZinePak.
THOSE ARE SERIOUS OFFERS.
THAT'S A LOT OF CASH
IN THE SHARK TANK.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA DO?
UH, WE HAVE A TEAM OF SUCH
HARDWORKING WOMEN IN NEW YORK.
BEFORE WE LEFT, THEY SAID, "WE'D
LOVE FOR YOU TO NOT DO A DEAL
THAT VALUES YOU
AT LESS THAN $5 MILLION,
BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED SO HARD
AND DONE SO MUCH
TO HELP BUILD
THIS COMPANY UP."
SO, I'M WONDERING
IF YOU ALL WOULD BE INTERESTED
IN DOING THE DEAL AT 14%.
WOW.
NO. I'LL PASS ON THAT.
I'M OUT.
I'VE WORKED -- I'VE WORKED
SO HARD FOR THE LAST 45 YEARS
TO GET TO THIS SEAT.
I CAN ONLY
GO AS LOW AS 20%.
THANK YOU.
BRITTANY, YOU'RE AT 14%.
WE'RE AT 20%.
JUST OFFER THEM MORE MONEY.
WE WILL MEET YOU
IN THE MIDDLE
AT 17.5%.
DON'T DO IT.
LET US CONFER, PLEASE.
YES.
[ Laughing ] ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE WITH YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE EXCITED.
WOW. YOU GUYS DID
AN AMAZING JOB.
Greiner:
YOUR WORK IS BEAUTIFUL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANKS, GUYS.
NOW, SHE IS SOLID.
Greiner: I THINK THEY WERE --
I THINK YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
I THINK YOU DID A GOOD DEAL,
EXCEPT YOU OVERPAID
TWO YEARS AHEAD.
KEVIN.
ADMIT IT -- YOU CAN'T
GET IT RIGHT EVERY TIME.
John: I DON'T
THINK YOU OVERPAID.
LORI, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY SAY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THE DEAL WE MADE.
IT WAS A LITTLE MORE EQUITY
THAN WE WANTED TO GIVE UP.
BUT FOR TWO SHARKS,
IT WAS A GAME WELL PLAYED.
Narrator: IN THE FIRST SEASON
OF "SHARK TANK,"
HEATH HALL
AND BRETT THOMPSON STRUCK A DEAL
WITH BARBARA CORCORAN
FOR THEIR BARBECUE SAUCE
AND SEASONING COMPANY,
PORK BARREL BBQ.
BARBARA,
ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER?
I AM.
$50,000
FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS.
WE'D LOVE
TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
HOW THEY'RE DOING NOW.
Thompson:
WHEN WE FIRST PITCHED,
WE WERE A SMALL COMPANY
WITH BARELY ANY SALES.
Hall: NOW, FIVE YEARS LATER, WE
HAVE OVER $10 MILLION IN SALES
AND A PORK BARREL BBQ
RESTAURANT.
THANK YOU. ENJOY.
OUR DISTRIBUTION
HAS EXPLODED.
WE'RE IN 5,000 STORES
WITH ANOTHER 3,000
ON THE WAY BY 2015.
THAT'S A LOT
OF BARBECUE SAUCE.
THERE IT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THAT.
WITH BARBARA'S HELP,
OUR DREAM HAS COME TRUE.
OUR PRODUCTS HAVE MADE IT
ONTO THE SHELVES OF SAM'S CLUB.
$2 MILLION. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANKS, BARBARA.
Thompson: SAM'S CLUB PICKING UP
OUR PRODUCT IN ALL THEIR STORES
IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST ORDER
WE'VE EVER HAD --
OVER $2 MILLION.
HERE WE ARE.
WE FINALLY GOT A SPOT INDOORS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Corcoran:
HEATH AND BRETT HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO GET INTO SAM'S CLUB
FOR OVER THREE YEARS.
THEY CAMPED OUT
IN THE PARKING LOT
TRYING TO MEET
THE UPPER MANAGEMENT.
I INTRODUCED THEM TO
THE UPPER MANAGEMENT, AND BAM!
THE ORDER
FINALLY WENT THROUGH.
A TOAST?! HEY, HEY, HEY!
CHEERS!
WE'RE FORTUNATE TO BE
ABLE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM,
COOKING
THE AMERICAN CUISINE.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE AMERICAN
THAN TWO GUYS WITH A GOOD IDEA
AND REALLY BEING ABLE TO CREATE
SOMETHING FROM NOTHING.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A BUSINESS
TO ENSURE YOU ALWAYS HAVE
THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE.
