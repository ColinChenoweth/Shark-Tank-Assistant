HELLO.
MY NAME IS JAMIE MANNING.
AND I'M DEAN WHITNEY.
WE'RE HERE TODAY
FROM BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.
OUR COMPANY IS
SnagaStool.
WE ARE SEEKING
$120,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR AN 18% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
SnagaStool IS
THE FIRST AND ONLY MOBILE APP
THAT ENSURES YOU'LL GET THE
BEST SEAT AT YOUR FAVORITE BAR.
AT THE BAR,
YOU GET THE BEST SERVICE,
THE BEST VIEW
OF THE TV,
AND YOU GET TO TALK
TO THE BARTENDER.
BUT AS WE ALL KNOW,
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET A SEAT
AT THE BAR.
NATURALLY, WE THOUGHT, "THERE'S
GOT TO BE AN APP FOR THAT."
BUT THERE WASN'T,
SO WE CREATED ONE.
NOW, WITH SnagaStool, YOU SIMPLY
PICK YOUR FAVORITE BAR --
LIKE THE SHARK TANK
BAR AND GRILL.
THEY MAKE A-A MEAN
"MARK CUBAN" LIBRE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU COULD SELECT
THE DATE AND THE TIME
AND THE NUMBER
OF BAR STOOLS,
AND YOU GET TO SNAG
THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE.
BARS LOVE SnagaStool.
IT CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES
TO FILL OFF-PEAK TIMES,
TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS,
AND TO CREATE LIFELONG FANS.
WE'VE CREATED AN INCREDIBLE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE,
AND WE'VE PROVEN THAT
WITH SOME AMAZING BARS.
SO, THE ONLY QUESTION
WE HAVE LEFT, SHARKS --
WHO WANTS
TO SNAG A STOOL?!
WHY DO I NEED YOU?
YOU SAID "OFF-PEAK TIMES."
IF I OWN THE BAR
AND IT'S OFF-PEAK,
THE BAR STOOL IS EMPTY
ANYWAY.
YOU DON'T
NEED TO RESERVE IT.
IF THE BAR IS
SUPER-BUSY,
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT TO ME
TO LEAVE THE BAR STOOL EMPTY
WAITING FOR YOU?
SOMEONE'S ALWAYS GONNA
SIT IN IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
SO, THERE ARE TWO TIME PERIODS
ON SnagaStool,
AND WE'VE --
WE'VE IDENTIFIED THOSE
AS "PEAK TIMES"
AND "OFF-PEAK TIMES."
OKAY.
AND DURING
THE OFF-PEAK TIMES,
THAT'S WHEN BARS
WILL OFFER INCENTIVES,
LIKE A FREE BEER
OR A FREE APPETIZER,
TO ATTRACT PEOPLE TO THEIR BAR
TO FILL THOSE STOOLS.
OKAY, SO, I GO ON YOUR APP,
I GET A FREE BEER?
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THE ADVANTAGE TO THE BAR
IS THEY GET CUSTOMERS IN
WHEN IT'S NOT BUSY.
ABSOLUTELY.
I COULD SEE, LIKE, PEOPLE JUST
REALLY BEING PISSED OFF...
IF THEY GO
INTO THEIR FAVORITE BAR...
YEAH.
...IT'S JAM-PACKED...
MM-HMM.
...AND THERE'S TWO SIGNS
LIKE THAT ON THE STOOLS.
Cuban: I COULD SEE
HAVING THOSE THERE
COULD BE LIKE --
MAKE IT INTERESTING, RIGHT?
"WHO'S COMING? WHO'S COMING?
IT'S RESERVED."
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU SEE
RESERVED TABLES.
I'M FROM BOSTON, OKAY? I'VE
NEVER HEARD OF THIS, ALL RIGHT?
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE EL SUPREMO BAR STOOL --
UPSTAIRS BAR, GRILL 23,
PATS GAME ON A SUNDAY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
FOR ME THERE?
I'M NOT HAVING ANY TROUBLE
FILLING THAT BAR.
IN FACT, PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING
TO SIT IN ONE OF THOSE SEATS.
SO, HOW DOES IT WORK?
LET'S SAY I WANT TO GO
TO A PATS GAME
AND I DON'T WANT TO SIT THERE
FOR TWO HOURS TO KEEP MY SEAT.
IS THERE ANY WAY
I CAN USE YOUR APP
TO RESERVE MY SEAT
15 MINUTES BEFORE GAME TIME?
IT DEPENDS ON IF THE BAR HAS
ENOUGH INVENTORY OF STOOLS
AND IF THEY HAVEN'T
BEEN SNAGGED UP TO THAT POINT.
'CAUSE THEY ALLOCATE
A CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR YOU?
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOT ALL BAR STOOLS ARE --
ARE OPEN FOR THE SERVICE.
PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY
FOR THIS EXPERIENCE.
SO, FOR PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T ABLE TO
GET TO THE BAR
TWO OR THREE HOURS EARLY --
PEOPLE
WHO ARE WORKING LATE,
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE
THE ABILITY TO SIT
AND NURSE A BEER
FOR HOURS --
THESE BARS NOW HAVE
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE --
SO, HOW DO YOU CHARGE?
HOW DO YOU CHARGE?
SO, WE CHARGE BY THE HOUR
OR BY THE GAME,
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE BAR
WOULD LIKE TO CHARGE.
OKAY, SO, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.
YEAH, SO -- SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE PARTNERED
WITH SOME AMAZING BARS
IN THE BOSTON AREA.
HOW MANY?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE WITH THREE BARS.
AND THAT'S WHAT --
THREE?
THREE BARS.
YEP. YEP.
GUYS, I GET YOU GOT TO CRAWL
BEFORE YOU BALL.
YEAH.
BUT WHY
JUST THREE BARS?
SO, WE JUST WANTED TO START OFF
WITH A PILOT,
AND WE REALLY WANTED TO
PARTNER WITH PEOPLE
WHO REALLY BELIEVED
IN THE CONCEPT.
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE REVENUE
FROM THESE BECAUSE --
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NO SALES.
LITTLE LESS.
IT'S -- IT'S OUR
PROOF OF CONCEPT.
THERE ARE SO MANY APPS
RIGHT NOW DESIGNED FOR BARS.
WHY ARE THEY EVEN
GOING TO DEAL WITH YOU
WHEN YOU'RE JUST
ONE OF 50 APPS
THAT ARE --
THAT ARE APPROACHING THEM?
SO, MARK,
IN -- IN OUR OPINION,
THE -- THE ART OF BARTENDING
HAS DIED SLOWLY.
WE'RE TRYING TO
GET BACK TO THE DAYS
WHEN A BARTENDER
REACHED ACROSS THE BAR
AND KNEW YOUR NAME,
KNEW WHO YOU WERE.
DON'T DISM--
YOU BETTER ROLL UP YOUR
PANT LEGS WHEN YOU SAY THAT,
RIGHT, BECAUSE --
DON'T DISMISS THIS,
BECAUSE IT MEANS A LOT.
BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW YOU BUILD LOYALTY
IS BY PROVIDING
AN ENHANCED CUSTOMER SERVICE.
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING, THOUGH.
IT'S NOT --
O'Leary: EXCEPT, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SOMETHING INTRIGUING
ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT
BECAUSE THERE'S
PROBABLY 25 STOOLS
UPSTAIRS AT GRILL 23,
ANOTHER 40 DOWNSTAIRS
AT THE DOWNSTAIRS BAR.
THEY ARE THE MOST COVETED SEATS
FOR ANY GAME IN BOSTON.
SO, WHY DO THEY NEED THEM?
BUT WAIT. HERE ME OUT ON THIS.
IF I COULD GO TO THEM SAY,
"LOOK, GIVE ME
20% OF YOUR INVENTORY,
AND I'LL GUARANTEE YOU
$200 FOR THAT SEAT."
BUT KEVIN'S ALMOST RIGHT, RIGHT?
AND HE'S --
HE'S ALWAYS RIGHT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
LOOK, THE ONLY WAY THAT I THINK
THIS IS GOING TO WORK
IS IF YOU WENT TO THIS 23,
AND YOU SAID "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GUARANTEE YOU
$10,000 UP FRONT."
THEN YOU HAVE INVENTORY.
WELL, IT'S NOT EVEN
FOR INVENTORY.
IT SHOWS THEM
THE VALUE THAT YOU BRING.
WELL, YOU HAVE A GUARANTEED
REVENUE STREAM, THEN.
RIGHT, IT'S NEWFOUND REVENUE.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
THEY'D DO IT.
YEAH, AND YOU JUST SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
GIVE ME FIVE BAR STOOLS
EVERY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.
I'M GONNA WRITE YOU
THE CHECK IN ADVANCE,
AND WHAT THEY SPEND ON THE BAR
IS STILL YOURS."
YOU GUYS KEEP ON SAYING,
"THERE'S VALUE,
THERE'S VALUE, THERE'S VALUE,"
BUT YOU HAVEN'T SHOWN
A WAY TO SELL THAT VALUE.
AND BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT,
I'M OUT.
I'M NOT A BAR GUY,
AND I CAN'T HELP YOU IN THIS.
I'M OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
THE ADVANTAGE TO THE BAR IS
YOU'RE GONNA GET MORE MONEY
THAN YOU WOULD NORMALLY.
SO, IF I KNOW ON A BUSY NIGHT
I'M MAKING $500 A SEAT,
AND, GOING BACK
TO MARK'S POINT,
YOU'RE GONNA GUARANTEE ME
$1,000 ON A CONSISTENT BASIS,
I'M IN.
OTHERWISE,
I DON'T NEED YOU.
WELL, BARS ALSO --
YOU'RE SELLING ACCESS
TO SOMETHING
THAT, IN PEAK TIMES,
GETS SOLD OUT ANYWAY.
THE -- THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM
IS YOU'RE SELLING
THE REAL ESTATE NOBODY WANTS
THROUGH YOUR SERVICE
AND NOT THE STUFF
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO GET.
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING TO IT,
BECAUSE PEOPLE
LIKE TO FEEL SPECIAL.
SO, BY BEING ABLE TO
RESERVE A SEAT,
THEY GET THE CONVENIENCE,
THEY GET TO WATCH THE GAME,
AND THEY ALSO FEEL SPECIAL.
SO I GET THAT.
MY PROBLEM IS
IT'S JUST TOO EARLY.
YOU ONLY HAVE THREE BARS.
YOU'RE JUST STARTING.
THERE'S NO PROOF
OF THE CONCEPT YET, FOR ME.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.
ALL ROADS LEAD
BACK TO MR. WONDERFUL,
AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A KERNEL OF
A REALLY INTERESTING IDEA HERE.
MM-HMM.
THE TEST SHOULD BE
WITH A BAR THAT ACTUALLY HAS
INCREDIBLY VALUABLE REAL ESTATE.
I'VE BEEN GOING TO GRILL 23
FOR 20 YEARS WITH MY BUDDIES
TO WATCH PAT GAMES.
THERE IS NO PRICE I WOULDN'T PAY
TO SIT THERE WITH THEM, OKAY?
BUT THE HASSLE IS
I GOT TO GO TWO HOURS EARLY
TO ESTABLISH MY REAL ESTATE.
IF YOU CAME IN HERE
AND SAID,
"WE'VE CUT A DEAL
WITH GRILL 23,"
YOU'D HAVE A HELL
OF AN AUCTION GOING ON.
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU BROUGHT ME.
YOU BROUGHT ME SORT OF
"LET'S BRING
SOME INCREMENTAL DOLLARS IN
AT A REALLY BAD TIME."
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY
GETTING ACCESS
TO REAL ESTATE
THAT I COVET.
THAT'S WHAT THE INTERNET
WOULD BE GREAT AT.
THAT'S WHERE
YOUR MODEL WOULD WORK.
AND YOU SHOW ME A BAR LIKE
GRILL 23 AGREEING TO DO THAT,
THEN I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT GOES NATIONWIDE.
I INVITE YOU BACK
WHEN IT'S FIXED,
AND I'M NOT PAYING A DIME MORE
THAN YOUR VALUATION TODAY,
'CAUSE I GAVE YOU
ALL THE GOOD IDEAS.
I MEAN, I SHOULD OWN
YOUR BUSINESS BY NOW.
NO, YOU TOOK <i>MY</i> GOOD IDEA.
WE JUST GAVE YOU A LESSON
ON HOW TO FIX IT.
THERE'S NOTHING TO
INVEST IN HERE. I'M OUT.
YOU GUYS DID NOT GIVE US
THESE IDEAS.
THESE IDEAS CAME TO US
IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS
OF TESTING
WITH THESE BARS.
GUYS, I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.
WE'LL SEE YOU AT GRILL 23.
THEY CAN'T GET A SEAT.
YEAH, THAT'S A PROBLEM.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
John: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Greiner: THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK.
Manning:
SnagaStool IS A TINDERBOX
READY TO JUST TAKE OFF,
AND WE'RE REALLY GONNA TAKE THIS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
IN THE NEXT YEAR.
