I'M ERIK.
AND I'M SASHA.
AND OUR COMPANY
IS BUCK MASON.
AND WE'RE BASED
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.
AMERICAN MEN ARE READY
FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE
OF FASHION BRAND --
ONE THAT'S ROOTED IN COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SENSIBILITIES,
NOT CONNECTED
TO FASHION.
THIS IS A REAL
TROCHUS-SHELL BUTTON.
AND WE HAVE
A BUSINESS MODEL
THAT SIMPLIFIES
THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE
AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR GUYS TO MESS UP.
HOW'S THE NECKLINE
THIS TIME?
Erik: 20 3/8, BABY.
AMERICAN-MADE IS ABSOLUTELY
A PRIORITY FOR US.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT LESS THAN 2% OF CLOTHING
PURCHASED IN AMERICA IS
ACTUALLY MADE IN AMERICA.
WE REALLY NEED TO
PRESS THE COLLAR OUT
AND GET ALL THE WRINKLES OUT.
THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE CRAFTSMEN MAKING
OUR JEANS, MAKING OUR SHIRTS
JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO US.
YOUR TOTAL'S GONNA BE
88 BUCKS.
Sasha: SINCE WE'VE LAUNCHED
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO,
OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN
GROWING RAPIDLY,
AND EVERY NEW PRODUCT
THAT WE CREATE
SELLS OUT IMMEDIATELY.
WE NEED THIS INVESTMENT
TO CREATE ENOUGH INVENTORY
TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND.
THE SHARKS
SHOULDN'T INVEST IN US
JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE MADE IN AMERICA.
THEY SHOULD INVEST IN US
BECAUSE WE'RE PROVING
THAT AMERICAN-MADE CAN
ACTUALLY BE PROFITABLE,
AND WE'RE DOING THAT
DAY AFTER DAY.
HI, SHARKS.
I'M ERIK SCHNAKENBERG.
AND I'M SASHA KOEHN.
WE'RE FROM LOS ANGELES,
CALIFORNIA.
OUR COMPANY IS
BUCK MASON.
WE'RE SEEKING $200,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 8% OF OUR COMPANY.
GROWING UP, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
MY FATHER DRESSED COOL.
HE WORE THE EXACT SAME THING
EVERY DAY --
BEAT-UP BLUE JEANS,
A WHITE V-NECK "T,"
AND A FLANNEL
WORK SHIRT.
HE WAS A BRICK MASON,
SO I GUESS HE WASN'T
TRYING TO LOOK COOL.
HE WAS SIMPLY DRESSING
OUT OF FUNCTION.
THESE DAYS, IT'S PRETTY EASY
FOR A GUY TO GET OVERWHELMED
WHEN IT COMES TO SHOPPING --
TOO MANY CHOICES,
TOO MANY TRENDS,
TOO MANY PRODUCTS
COMING FROM COUNTRIES
WE'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.
WE'VE CREATED BUCK MASON
TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY,
AMERICAN-MADE CLOTHING
AT AN ACCESSIBLE PRICE POINT.
WE FOCUS ON THE BASICS,
LIKE THE PERFECT T-SHIRT,
THE QUINTESSENTIAL BLUE JEAN,
AND THE CLASSIC
OXFORD SHIRT.
ON OUR WEBSITE,
WE SHOW OUR CUSTOMERS
HOW OUR PRODUCTS
ARE BEING MADE
AND WHO'S ACTUALLY
MAKING THEM.
WE CALL THIS AMERICAN-MADE
PRICE TRANSPARENCY.
AT BUCK MASON,
WE'RE IGNORING FASHION TRENDS.
IT'S NOT ABOUT STANDING OUT
OR FITTING IN.
IT'S ABOUT TASTE.
AND, LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
YOUR ORDINARY FASHION DESIGNERS.
WE'RE TWO MIDWESTERN GUYS
OBSESSED
WITH RECLAIMING
AMERICAN QUALITY.
SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO HELP US BUILD
THE NEXT GREAT
AMERICAN CLOTHING BRAND?
CAN WE SEE
SOME OF THE CLOTHES?
OF COURSE.
YEAH, SASHA'S GONNA
HAND YOU SOME.
THANK YOU.
Cuban: YEAH,
SAVE MY SIZE FOR ME.
DO YOU HAVE
MY 28-INCH WAIST?
[ CHUCKLES ]
OH, THIS FEELS NICE.
Sasha: THANK YOU.
SO, ERIK, WALK ME THROUGH
HOW I BUY IT.
WHERE DO I GET THEM?
SURE.
SURE.
WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS
DIRECT TO CONSUMER ONLINE
THROUGH THE BUCK MASON WEBSITE.
THERE'S TWO WAYS
TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS.
ONE IS THE INDIVIDUAL
SINGLE ITEMS,
WHICH, AS YOU CAN SEE,
ARE REALLY WEARABLE.
THEY'RE COOL NOW. THEY'LL
BE COOL 50 YEARS FROM NOW.
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY THAT WE
SELL MERCHANDISE ON THE SITE,
AND THAT'S
THROUGH CURATED PACKAGES.
SO, WHAT WE DO IS
WE PUT TOGETHER
THREE TO SIX PIECES
THAT YOU CANNOT MESS UP.
THE REASON
WHY IT WOULD WORK FOR YOU
IS BECAUSE IT'S FOR GUYS
THAT ARE JUST BUSY,
YOU KNOW, GUYS THAT DON'T
HAVE TIME TO SHOP.
OR GUYS THAT HAVE
NO FASHION SENSE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AND WHAT DO YOU CHARGE
FOR A PAIR OF JEANS?
SO, THOSE JEANS
ARE $135.
$135 IS NOT CHEAP
FOR A PAIR OF JEANS.
THE $135
IS A GREAT VALUE
FOR THE PRODUCT
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING.
FOR AMERICAN-MADE,
WE'RE ABOUT AS COMPETITIVE
AS YOU CAN GET FOR THE PRICE.
OKAY, AND WHAT ABOUT THE SHIRTS?
THE T-SHIRTS ARE $24.
BUTTON-DOWN SHIRTS
ARE $88.
SASHA, WHAT ARE
YOUR SALES SO FAR?
OUR SALES ARE $300,000.
IN WHAT TIME PERIOD?
EIGHT MONTHS.
EIGHT MONTHS.
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR A LIVING
BEFORE YOU DID THIS?
I'VE SPENT 15 YEARS
IN THE APPAREL BUSINESS.
AND I COME FROM THE TOTALLY
OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM.
I COME FROM
MORE TECH/MEDIA SIDE.
PRIOR TO STARTING
BUCK MASON WITH ERIK,
I CREATED AN
INTERACTIVE-CONTENT PLATFORM
CALLED
"THIS BUILT AMERICA"
PROFILING COMPANIES
THAT ARE REIMAGINING
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING.
OH, THAT'S COOL.
GOOD FOR YOU.
AND IT DID NOTHING BUT INSPIRE
ME TO BE COMPLETELY PASSIONATE
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
IF I BECOME A CUSTOMER,
AND I BUY, LET'S SAY,
A SHIRT AND JEANS,
I LIKE IT, HOW MANY
MORE TIMES IN A YEAR
DO I BUY?
WHAT'S THE LIFETIME VALUE
OF ONE OF THESE GUYS?
WELL, 38% OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE
REPEAT IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS.
THAT'S GOOD.
AND OF THAT 38%,
10% HAVE PURCHASED
MORE THAN THREE TIMES.
THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
SO, YOU GOT GUYS
BUYING A WHITE T-SHIRT,
TESTING US OUT,
REALIZING THEY LIKE IT,
COMING BACK AND BUYING
FIVE MORE AT A TIME.
AND THAT'S HOW GUYS SHOP.
WHAT MATTERS IS BRAND,
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.
BUCK MASON IS AN AMERICAN,
HEARTFELT BRAND,
AND YOU'RE GONNA PICK
A PRICE POINT
WHERE YOU THINK YOUR
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST ONLINE
IS GONNA BE LESS
THAN THEIR LIFETIME VALUE.
THAT'S WHAT
THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS.
'CAUSE I DON'T HEAR
A RETAIL ROLL-OUT STRATEGY.
I DON'T HEAR YOU PUTTING UP
RETAIL STORES IN SoHo.
IS HE RIGHT?
HE'S PARTIALLY RIGHT.
WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL
TO DATE WITH ACQUIRING CUSTOMERS
AT VERY LITTLE
TO ABSOLUTELY NO COST.
AND WE'VE BEEN DOING IT
THROUGH BOTH OUR SOCIAL
AND P.R. CHANNELS.
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS
THROUGH SOCIAL.
IT'S BEEN A VALUABLE TOOL
FOR US.
SO, GIVE US
YOUR METRICS ON SOCIAL.
INSTAGRAM'S BEEN
VERY HELPFUL.
WE HAVE
AN INFLUENCER PROGRAM, OKAY?
WE IDENTIFY PEOPLE
THAT WE RELATE TO
VERY WELL ON INSTAGRAM.
THEY HAVE VERY HIGH AMOUNTS
OF FOLLOWERS.
MOST OF THEM
ARE PHOTOGRAPHERS,
AND THE REASON WHY
WE FOCUS ON THEM
AND NOT SPECIFICALLY PUTTING
A LOT OF EFFORT
INTO FASHION BLOGGERS
IS 'CAUSE, MORE OR LESS,
WE'RE
AN ANTI-FASHION BRAND.
LIKE, WE'RE FOCUSING
ON THE BASICS AND THE CLASSICS.
WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING TRENDS.
THAT MAKES SENSE.
AND OUR CUSTOMER IS
FOLLOWING THESE PHOTOGRAPHERS,
NOT THE FASHION BLOGS.
THEY'RE NOT <i>GQ</i> GUYS.
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR THESE PHOTOGRAPHERS?
ARE YOU GIVING THEM
AFFILIATE MONEY?
YEAH. IT'S A -- IT'S A --
YEAH, IT'S A LOT OF GIFTING.
IS YOUR VISION
TO TAKE THE $200,000
AND ACCELERATE
THE EXISTING BUSINESS MODEL,
OR ARE YOU GONNA EXPAND INTO
RETAIL OR GO INTO WHOLESALE?
PRIMARILY ONLINE.
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ONLINE, YEP.
SO, YOU'RE GONNA STAY
WITH THIS BUSINESS MODEL?
HOW MUCH
HAVE YOU GUYS INVESTED?
SASHA AND I
ARE THE ONLY INVESTORS.
WE'VE INVESTED $10,000.
CAN YOU DO $500,000 THIS YEAR?
IS THAT WHAT YOU FIGURE?
SURE. YEAH.
YES.
AND WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA MAKE ON THAT
AFTER YOU PAY YOURSELVES
SOMETHING?
WE JUST STARTED PAYING
OURSELVES.
WE THINK THAT
WE'LL MAKE ABOUT --
PROBABLY ABOUT $35,000
ON THAT.
OHH.
Cuban: GUYS, I THINK
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GREAT,
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE CLOTHING BUSINESS.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
I'LL BE A CUSTOMER.
IT'S JUST NOT A FIT FOR ME.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANKS, MARK.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT,
AND I LOVE
THE MADE-IN-AMERICA STORY.
BUT I THINK
IF YOU WERE FARTHER AHEAD,
FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD -- I'M
NOT SURE HOW MUCH I COULD ADD
TO THE MIX OF KNOWING
WHAT'S REALLY RIGHT
TO HIT GUYS IN THE HEART
OF WHAT THEY WANT TO WEAR.
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT, LORI. THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
WELL, LOOK, GUYS.
INCREDIBLE THAT YOU GOT
TO THIS POINT WITH $10,000.
THAT'S REMARKABLE.
THANK YOU.
BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING YOU.
YEAH.
AND, FOR ME,
AS AN ONLINE COMPANY,
THAT'S THE STRUGGLE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY. APPRECIATE IT, ROB.
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, GUYS, BASICALLY,
COMPANIES IN CLOTHING TRADE
AT AROUND FOUR TIMES
THEIR CASH FLOW.
AND THEY'RE MUCH LARGER
THAN YOU ARE.
SO, YOU NEED TO BE MAKING
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $600,000
AND $750,000 AFTER TAX TO GET
A VALUATION OF $2.5 MILLION.
YOU'VE COME IN
AND BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE
IN TERMS
OF YOUR VALUATION HERE.
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR
WHAT YOU'RE WORTH YET.
IT'S A CONCEPT THAT'S STARTING
TO SHOW SOME TRACTION.
I LOVE THE BRANDING.
I REALLY DO.
BUT TO GET $200,000
OUT OF SOMEBODY,
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PART WITH HALF THE COMPANY.
I THINK WHAT
YOU'RE INVESTING IN HERE
IS, YOU KNOW, THE VISION
AND THE TALENT ON BOARD.
John:
COME ON, GUYS.
IF YOU'VE BEEN
IN THE BUSINESS THIS LONG,
YOU KNOW THAT THIS VALUATION
IS SOMEWHAT CRAZY.
$2.5 MILLION --
YOU'RE PUTTING A VALUE
ON WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
DO IN THE FUTURE, I GUESS.
THAT'S THE VALUE OF IT.
BUT MY DADDY DIDN'T HAVE
TWO CRYSTAL BALLS,
SO I CAN'T SEE
IN THE FUTURE, RIGHT?
THIS IS WAY TOO COSTLY FOR ME,
'CAUSE THIS IS MY INDUSTRY.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
SO, THERE'S ONE SHARK LEFT.
Herjavec: WOW, THE
MOST FASHIONABLE SHARK'S LEFT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
KEVIN?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO HERE.
I'M -- I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE WORTH RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE WORTH A PARTNERSHIP
AND THE BEGINNING OF A BRAND
THAT NO ONE'S HEARD OF
UNTIL TODAY.
SO THE ONLY WAY
I CAN DO THIS DEAL IS
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000,
I WANT 50%.
AND EVEN THAT'S GENEROUS.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO FAR FROM --
FROM MAKING MONEY.
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU GUYS
EVEN EATING?
THAT'S WHY THEY MAKE
SKINNY JEANS.
ERIK AIRBNB's HIS PLACE AND
CRASHES ON MY COUCH SOMETIMES.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
I MEAN, THAT -- THAT
IS A START-UP.
YOU ARE GOVERNED BY GRAVITY.
John: IS THAT YOUR OFFER?
IT'S MY ONLY OFFER.
Greiner: NO, YOU GUYS --
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000
FOR 50%.
Herjavec: YEAH.
I'LL HELP
GET YOUR WORD OUT.
I'M PROBABLY, OBVIOUSLY,
GONNA BE ONE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS
BECAUSE I LIKE WHAT YOU DO.
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S GONNA BE HELPFUL.
I THINK IT IS.
I'M VERY FASHION FORWARD.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF
THE DAY, THAT'S THE ONLY OFFER
YOU'RE GONNA GET,
'CAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE IS OUT.
UH...
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WE HAVE SCRAPED
AND CLAWED TO DO.
AND WE'RE BUILDING IT
BRICK BY BRICK,
AND, YOU KNOW,
FOR US TO GIVE UP
MORE THAN 15% EQUITY
IN THE COMPANY
AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME
IS NOT SOMETHING
WE'D BE INTERESTED IN,
SO...
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT GRAVITY'S DONE TO YOU
HERE TODAY
IN THE SHARK TANK?
LOOKING AT THE DOLLARS
YOU GENERATE FROM IT
IN A COMMODITY BUSINESS,
THERE'S NO WAY
TO GIVE YOU THAT VALUE.
BUT STICK
TO YOUR GUNS, GUYS.
I MEAN, THERE -- THERE SHOULD BE
NO DESPERATION IN WHAT YOU DO.
MARK, BUT DO YOU THINK
I'M BEING UNFAIR?
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT.
YES, YOU'RE BEING UNFAIR.
WHY DON'T YOU COUNTER HIM?
UM, WE WOULD LIKE TO
COUNTEROFFER YOU
WITH $200,000 FOR 15%
PLUS A $100,000 LINE OF CREDIT.
15%?
CREDIT WOULD ONLY GO -- YES.
15%?
WOW.
THEY CHANGED THE OFFER.
FOR -- FOR $200,000?
$200,000.
PLUS $100,000 LINE OF CREDIT
SPECIFICALLY FOR INVENTORY.
AND THEY'LL THROW IN A
LIFETIME SUPPLY OF FREE CLOTHES.
YOU GET A LIFETIME SUPPLY
OF FREE CLOTHING.
[ LAUGHS ]
I CAN BUY A LOT OF JEANS
FOR $200,000.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU KNOW, GUYS, I PROVIDE
A FACTORY FOR ALL MY COMPANIES.
WHEN YOU HAVE REAL SALES
AND IT'S WORKING,
IT'S NOT HARD
TO FINANCE THAT.
I DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT THAT.
I'M STILL STUCK WITH HOW
I EVER GET MY MONEY BACK.
UNDER THE MODEL
YOU JUST GAVE ME,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
$2 MILLION AFTER TAX.
KEVIN, ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS
GO DOOR-TO-DOOR,
SELL SOME JEANS.
YEAH.
IN A FAIR MARKET,
IT WON'T TAKE YOU LONG.
GUYS, LOOK, I-I-I'M --
I'M -- IT'S THE FIRST --
ERIK, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $200,000
PLUS $100,000 ON A LINE
OF CREDIT FOR 25%.
HMM, NOW IT GETS INTERESTING.
AND NOW IT GETS INTERESTING.
O'Leary: YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA
COMPETE WITH THAT.
I WOULDN'T
EVEN DO THAT DEAL,
SO, GUYS, IF YOU DON'T WANT
MY ORIGINAL OFFER, I'M OUT.
AND SINCE CLEARLY YOU DON'T,
DEAL WITH THAT.
YEAH, I'LL GO -- I'LL GO
DOWN TO 25% FROM KEVIN'S.
I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
I DON'T KNOW IF I SEE
THE HUGE FUTURE VISION.
YOU GOT TO TAKE ME OUT
FOR A BEER
AND EXPLAIN
HOW WE'RE GETTING CUSTOMERS,
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
UM...
WOULD YOU CONSIDER --
I WOULDN'T.
I WOULDN'T CONSIDER
ANYTHING BELOW THAT.
O'Leary: GUYS,
YOU'RE SO FAR FROM --
YOU NEED -- YOU NEED
$800,000 OF FREE CASH
TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR
EVEN THAT VALUE.
YEAH, I'M NOT TRYING
TO PUT YOU OVER A BARREL.
Cuban:
LOOK AT THIS WAY, GUYS --
LET ME -- LET ME --
LOOK, ROBERT'S A GREAT PARTNER.
AND I'M GONNA
SELL YOU ON ROBERT
AND WHY
YOU SHOULD DO THIS DEAL.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TURN
YOUR INVENTORY FROM THAT CASH
SO MANY TIMES AND CREATE SO MUCH
MORE VALUE WITH THAT CASH,
YOU'LL SWAMP
THE 10% DELTA.
THAT IS A HELL OF A DEAL.
THAT IS A HELL OF A DEAL
WITH WHAT YOU'RE AT TODAY.
YOU MAKE NO MONEY.
YOU'RE AIRBNB'ing YOUR HOUSE.
LET HIM -- LET HIM ANSWER.
ROBERT, ROBERT,
WE'RE HUGE FANS,
AND WE --
WE APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.
UM...AT THIS POINT --
IT'S THE RIGHT OFFER, ERIK.
A-AT THIS POINT --
IT'S THE RIGHT OFFER.
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE -- BECAUSE WE
BELIEVE -- AND BECAUSE WE --
GUYS, YOU'RE OVERVALUING
THE EQUITY.
SOMETIMES, CASH IS
MORE VALUABLE THAN EQUITY.
[ Sarcastically ] OH, REALLY?
LET THE MAN SPEAK.
LOOK, GUYS, I AM
ALL ABOUT OWNING THE EQUITY
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
BUT SOME BUSINESSES
REQUIRE CASH UP FRONT.
$300,000 IS GONNA
GET YOU INVENTORY.
YOU'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER.
YOU'RE GONNA GET
TO THAT NEXT STEP.
STOP AND THINK FOR A MINUTE
IF YOU'RE GONNA WALK OUT OF HERE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
SAY TO YOURSELVES,
"WISH I HAD SAID 'YES.'"
ROBERT, WE KNOW
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.
FOR US, IT'S --
IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN.
AND FOR US TO GIVE UP --
BUT HOW QUICKLY?
FOR US TO GIVE UP
THAT MUCH EQUITY...
YOU MEAN 25%? IS IT 25%?
YOU'RE OVERVALUING
THE EQUITY, GUYS.
...IS NOT -- IS NOT
IN OUR INTEREST.
WE COULD DO THE SAME DEAL
FOR 17%.
NO, GUYS, NOW WE'RE GETTING
INTO THE REALM OF SILLY.
AN 8% DELTA
ON SOMETHING THIS NEW?
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
THIS IS REALLY
AN INVESTMENT ABOUT YOU GUYS
AND WHAT YOU'VE BUILT
SO FAR.
$200,000, 25%,
$100,000 LINE OF CREDIT.
WE'LL GET THERE QUICKLY
TOGETHER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR
OFFER -- FOR YOUR OFFER, ROBERT.
UM,
WE HAVE TO DECLINE.
[ Scoffing ] OHH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
CONGRATS, GUYS. GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
WE'RE TRYING
TO BUILD SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD GIVE
TO OUR CHILDREN.
GIVING UP 25% 10 MONTHS
INTO THE LIFE OF OUR COMPANY
IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF THE LONG HAUL.
I REALLY THINK THAT WAS
THE RIGHT OFFER FOR THEM.
WELCOME TO MY WORLD --
THE WORLD OF DESIGNERS.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, COME ON.
NO CLUE.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A FORMER NFL PLAYER
WITH A PRODUCT DESIGNED
TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT.
