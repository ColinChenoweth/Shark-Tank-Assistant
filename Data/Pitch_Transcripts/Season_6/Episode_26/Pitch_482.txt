HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS BRYAN SCOTT.
SO, BRYAN,
HOW DID YOU INVENT THIS?
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
ARE YOU A --
NO.
[ GROANS ]
THAT'S A GOOD WAY
TO THROUGH TO US, BRYAN.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I SHOULD HAVE PUT
THESE THINGS IN MY EAR
TO AVOID THE SHOCK.
YOU KNOW, IN BASKETBALL --
YOU KNOW, THE GUY IN BASKETBALL
WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING,
THE BETTER PLACE
FOR YOU, BRYAN,
IS TO ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE
THE LICENSE DEAL WITH THEM
WELL, BRYAN, THE STORY, FOR ME,
JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.
I -- I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOU DID,
NECESSARILY, A BAD JOB,
BUT I JUST --
I DON'T SEE
THE APPLICATIONS.
I'M OUT.
OOH. ROBERT,
I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I'M VERY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.
BRYAN, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
BUT THERE'S
<i>A LOT</i> OF CONTINGENCIES.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT,
BUT MARK WANTS TO MAKE AN OFFER
FOR BRYAN'S INSOLE COMPANY,
NOENE.
IF THE SCIENCE
BEHIND THIS IS LEGIT...
YES.
...THEN I'M INTERESTED.
OKAY.
RIGHT?
SO, WE'RE GONNA DO
OUR DUE DILIGENCE.
YES.
BUT I'M GONNA OFFER YOU...
MM-HMM.
...$100,000 FOR 20%.
OKAY.
ONE MORE CONTINGENCY IS YOU GOT
TO CONVINCE THIS GUY TO COME IN
Scott: THE THING THAT HAS
ALWAYS MOTIVATED ME IS
TO MAKE PEOPLE PROUD.
THAT, "MAN, BRYAN CAME THROUGH.
HE REALLY MADE US PROUD."
