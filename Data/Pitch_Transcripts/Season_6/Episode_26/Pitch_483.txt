HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS BRYAN SCOTT.
I LIVE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS NOENE USA.
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING
$100,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
NOENE --
THEY'RE HIGH-TECH INSOLES
THAT ABSORB AND DISPERSE BOTH
LOW- AND HIGH-FREQUENCY SHOCKS
THAT ENTERS OUR BODIES WHENEVER
WE JUMP, RUN, OR EVEN WALK.
CURRENTLY, TO TRY
TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM,
WE BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
IT'S SOFT, IT'S CUSHY, AND SO
WE THINK IT'LL FIX OUR PROBLEM.
BUT IT DOESN'T.
TAKE A LOOK.
THE BOUNCE OF THE BALL
IS JUST GONNA SHOW
HOW ENERGY IS
ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED
BACK UP INTO OUR BODIES
WITH EACH AND EVERY STEP
THAT WE TAKE.
IT'S CALLED
THE REBOUND EFFECT,
AND THAT REBOUND EFFECT CAUSES
CHRONIC PAIN AND INJURY.
NOENE, ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT'S A VISCOELASTIC,
VULCANIZED RUBBER.
AND IT'S REMARKABLY ABLE
TO ABSORB AND INTERNALLY
DISPERSE THE SHOCK,
LEAVING VERY LITTLE
TO NO REBOUND EFFECT.
SO, WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS
TAKE THIS PIECE OF GLASS.
I'M GONNA TAKE THE NOENE,
AND I'M GONNA LAY IT ON TOP,
AND THEN I'M GONNA TAKE
THIS WEIGHTED BOCCIE BALL
AND DROP IT ON THE NOENE.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Greiner: OH, MY GOD.
NO WAY.
NO WAY.
SO, NOTICE...
OOH.
WOW.
...IT'S NOT DAMAGED.
BUT WITHOUT THE PROTECTION
OF NOENE...
Herjavec:
EFFECTIVE PRESENTATION.
I HAVE ONE OTHER DEMONSTRATION
TO SHOW REALLY QUICK.
SO, HERE IS
A REGULAR PINK RUBBER BALL,
AND HERE IS A RUBBER BALL
THAT'S MADE OF NOENE.
LET'S COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE.
OH, THAT'S COOL.
I HAVE SOME INSOLES
HERE FOR YOU,
BECAUSE EVERY SHOE AND SNEAKER
NEEDS A PAIR OF NOENE.
SO, I GUARANTEE YOU OUR PRODUCT
IS THINNER THAN A DIME.
GOT IT.
I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU
TO FIND ANOTHER PRODUCT
THAT'S THINNER THAN A DIME
TO PROTECT THE GLASS
LIKE I JUST DID.
SO, THESE
THAT I JUST HANDED OUT,
THESE ARE CALLED
OUR "UNDER INSOLES."
AND WHAT YOU DO IS
YOU TAKE OUT THE ORIGINAL INSOLE
OF YOUR SNEAKER,
YOU PUT THIS IN IN YOUR SNEAKER,
AND THEN YOU PUT
YOUR ORIGINAL INSOLE BACK IN.
IT'S SO THIN AND LIGHT,
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FIT OF YOUR SHOE.
IN ADDITION
TO THE SUPPORT INSOLE,
WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IS
ACTUALLY COME UP
WITH OUR
WOMEN'S HEEL VERSION.
AND THAT'S THE --
THE PROTOTYPE
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN
THE FINAL STAGES OF FINISHING.
SO, BRYAN,
HOW DID YOU INVENT THIS?
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
ARE YOU A --
NO.
I AM NOT A DOCTOR,
AND I AM NOT A SCIENTIST.
I PLAYED IN THE NFL
FOR 10 YEARS.
YOU PLAYED IN THE NFL?
WHAT TEAM?
I DID. YES, I DID.
I STARTED -- I WAS DRAFTED
TO ATLANTA IN THE SECOND ROUND.
THREE YEARS THERE,
ONE YEAR IN NEW ORLEANS,
AND THEN SIX IN BUFFALO.
WOW.
SO, OUR FIRST QUARTER IS
WE'RE FOCUSING ON INSOLES.
WHY? BECAUSE IT'S A PRODUCT
THAT SELLS OVER IN EUROPE.
THE SECOND PHASE IS ACTUALLY
THE DIFFERENT SPORT APPLICATIONS
SUCH AS BASEBALL-BAT GRIPS,
BOXING GLOVES...
OH.
...TENNIS RACKETS --
TENNIS ELBOW, GOLF ELBOW,
ALL OF THAT.
TAKE US BACK TO THE --
THE BACKGROUND YOU HAVE
ON WHY THIS WORKS.
OKAY, SO, FIRST, NOENE,
IT'S A COMPANY OVER IN EUROPE
THAT HAS BEEN SELLING
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
THEY OWN THE PRODUCT?
THEY OWN THE PRODUCT.
AND DO YOU MIND SHARING
THEIR SALES?
THEY BRING IN, ON AVERAGE,
ABOUT $1.2 MILLION ANNUALLY
ON INSOLES.
YOU'RE NOT BRINGING US
THE EUROPEAN STUFF, OBVIOUSLY.
DID YOU GUYS SIGN
A LICENSE WITH THEM?
YES, SO, WE SIGNED AN EXCLUSIVE
DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT
TO WHERE WE HAVE
ALL OF THE U.S. AND CANADA
FOR THE SPORT INSOLES.
HOW MUCH DO YOU BUY
A UNIT FOR?
$6.
$6?
OOH, THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
OHH.
$6 FOR A PAIR?
YES, $6 FOR A PAIR.
RIGHT.
AND HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
$29.99 IS
WHAT THEY RETAIL FOR.
6 BUCKS IS EXPENSIVE.
LIKE, IN BETWEEN AN ORTHOTIC...
NO, IT'S EXPENSIVE TO MAKE.
BUT $29.99
FOR A RETAIL PRICE...
John: IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE.
...IS NOT EXPENSIVE.
THE NEXT QUESTION
WILL PROVE THAT.
HOW MUCH ARE YOUR SALES
THIS LAST YEAR?
SO, WE PRIDE OUR PRODUCT
ON BEING THINNER THAN A DIME.
AND TO THIS DAY, CURRENTLY
WE HAVE NOT SOLD A DIME.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THE REASON --
AND THE REASON IS --
[ GROANS ]
THAT'S A GOOD WAY
TO THROUGH TO US, BRYAN.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I SHOULD HAVE PUT
THESE THINGS IN MY EAR
TO AVOID THE SHOCK.
YOU KNOW, IN BASKETBALL --
YOU KNOW, THE GUY IN BASKETBALL
WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING,
"I'M OPEN, I'M OPEN, COACH,"
AND THE COACH SAID,
"THERE'S A REASON
WHY YOU'RE OPEN, RIGHT?"
WELL, WAIT A SECOND.
FIRST, LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK
AND FIRST EXPLAIN WHY
WE HAVE NOT SOLD ANYTHING YET.
WE HAVEN'T TAKEN IT
TO MARKET YET.
I WAS INTRODUCED
TO THE COMPANY IN JANUARY.
SO,
DO YOU OWN EQUITY?
YES, I DO OWN EQUITY.
THAT'S CORRECT.
HOW MUCH EQUITY DO YOU HAVE?
SO, THERE'S FOUR OF US,
SO 25%.
AND WE'VE COMMITTED
$1 MILLION TO THIS PROJECT,
TO THIS COMPANY.
YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING
$1 MILLION.
JUST -- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT MAKES NO SENSE.
WHY, SIR?
WHY WOULD YOU SPEND
THAT MUCH MONEY?
WE EACH HAVE $250,000
TO PUT IN.
SO, YOU'RE SAYING THAT --
YOU'RE SAYING THAT RIGHT NOW...
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
...YOU'VE DEDICATED --
IN CASE THERE'S A CASH CALL,
YOU HAVE A CASH CALL
UP TO $1 MILLION?
IF YOU NEED IT.
YES.
AND THAT'S WHERE I CAME
WITH THE $1 MILLION VALUATION.
IT WASN'T OFF OF PROJECTED SALES
OR WHAT WE CAN OR CAN'T DO.
OKAY, NOW WE'VE HEARD
YOUR STORY,
I CAN TELL YOU
A CERTAINTY.
BECAUSE OF THE FACT
THAT YOU REALLY HAVE
NO SALES YET, AT ALL,
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET...
MM-HMM.
...A $1 MILLION VALUATION
FOR THIS,
EVEN IF THE PRODUCT HAS
THE MERITS YOU SUGGEST IT HAS.
AND ALSO,
THE STRUCTURE OF THIS DEAL
DOESN'T MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE.
THE BETTER PLACE
FOR YOU, BRYAN,
IS TO ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE
THE LICENSE DEAL WITH THEM
AND GET
A SMALL PIECE OF IT.
NOBODY WANTS TO
START FROM SCRATCH
AND BUILD A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
FOR ONE INSOLE.
THAT MAKES NO SENSE
WHATSOEVER.
IT'S NOT JUST ONE INSOLE, KEVIN.
WHAT IS IT?
WE WOULD LOVE -- WE WOULD
TAKE A LICENSING DEAL.
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO JUST BE
A DISTRIBUTION COMPANY.
YEAH, YOU WANT TO TAKE
ANY REVENUE YOU CAN GET
AND GET THIS THING GOING,
RIGHT?
WE JUST WANT TO GET IT GOING,
AND, HONESTLY --
BUT IT'S MORE PERSONAL
THAN JUST MONEY TO ME.
WELL, BRYAN, THE STORY, FOR ME,
JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.
I -- I'M NOT TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOU DID,
NECESSARILY, A BAD JOB,
BUT I JUST --
I DON'T SEE
THE APPLICATIONS.
I'M OUT.
OOH. ROBERT,
I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I'M VERY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
THE SKEPTICISM.
I CAN'T GET AROUND THE FACT
THAT THE UNIT COST IS $6,
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
A WHOLE LOT OF WORK.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF WORK.
IT IS A LOT OF WORK, BUT, KEVIN,
CAN I JUST STAY THIS --
A WISE COACH ONCE TOLD ME,
"YOU CANNOT CLIMB
TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN
IF THE SIDES ARE SMOOTH."
NO, I TOTALLY GET ALL THAT.
AND, YES, THERE IS WORK, BUT --
I WOULD WANT 50%.
I'D WANT HALF THE COMPANY
FOR THE AMOUNT OF WORK
AHEAD OF ME.
SO, I'M OUT.
OKAY. I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, KEVIN.
Greiner: I THINK
IT'S INTERESTING.
MM-HMM. OKAY.
I WILL DEFINITELY
BE A TESTER.
BUT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE...
MM-HMM.
...FOR THAT REASON
I'M OUT.
MAN, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, LORI.
I WAS HOPING THE WOMEN'S HEELS
THROUGH QVC --
BRYAN, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
BUT THERE'S
<i>A LOT</i> OF CONTINGENCIES.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT,
BUT MARK WANTS TO MAKE AN OFFER
FOR BRYAN'S INSOLE COMPANY,
NOENE.
IF THE SCIENCE
BEHIND THIS IS LEGIT...
YES.
...THEN I'M INTERESTED.
OKAY.
RIGHT?
SO, WE'RE GONNA DO
OUR DUE DILIGENCE.
YES.
BUT I'M GONNA OFFER YOU...
MM-HMM.
...$100,000 FOR 20%.
OKAY.
ONE MORE CONTINGENCY IS YOU GOT
TO CONVINCE THIS GUY TO COME IN
AS MY PARTNER, BECAUSE
HE OWNS ETONIC BRAND, RIGHT?
OKAY. MM. OKAY.
AND I THINK THAT
IF THIS TRULY DOES WORK,
THEN MAKING IT
AS PART OF A SHOE
WOULD BE A UNIQUE VALUE ADD...
MM-HMM.
AND I WANT TO SEE
IF HE BELIEVES IN THAT.
AND CUBAN'S RIGHT. WE --
WE PURCHASED THE BRAND ETONIC.
MM-HMM.
AND IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS
WITH US WORKING
ON THE -- THE RUNNING SHOE
BECAUSE, GUYS LIKE ROBERT --
YOU GIVE THEM THE WRONG SHOE,
YOU'RE DEAD.
THAT'S IT.
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
DAYMOND?
I'M GONNA GO IN WITH CUBAN
AND GIVE YOU AN OFFER --
$100,000
FOR 20% ON MY SIDE,
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE $100,000
FOR 20% --
OH, SO YOU WANT 40%?
I THOUGHT WE'D JUST SPLIT IT.
OH, NO. OH, NO.
OKAY.
THAT'S YOUR CALL.
OOH.
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
GOT TO MAKE
A DECISION, THEN.
I KNOW I WOULD DEFINITELY
GET MY HEAD CUT OFF...
AND YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
RIGHT NOW. YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.
...IF I GAVE UP 40%.
WELL, BUT YOU THINK OF IT
LIKE THIS --
YOU'RE GETTING TWO SHARKS.
RIGHT.
ONE WITH AN IMMEDIATE USE
FOR IT.
MM-HMM.
RIGHT?
SO, NOW YOU HAVE ME
ON THIS SIDE.
I THINK YOU KNOW TONY
FROM ZAPPOS, RIGHT?
YEP. YEP.
SO, WE HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT
OF RESOURCES.
YEAH, LOOK, I DID WORK
WITH SKECHERS.
THEY'D BRING US IN
IN A HEARTBEAT.
OH, ROBERT GREENBERG
FROM SKECHERS, AS WELL.
YEAH, ROBERT, YEAH.
O'Leary: YOU'VE GOT AN OFFER.
RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT $200,000
FOR 40%.
EACH SHARK THAT'S INTERESTED
WANTS 20%.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THESE TWO
ARE THE RIGHT PARTNERS.
MM-HMM.
WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?
YOU CAN COUNTER.
YES, I DEFINITELY
WOULD LOVE TO COUNTER.
SO, IF BOTH OF YOU WANTED
TO GIVE $100,000 FOR 25%.
I LIKED IT AT THE 30%.
30% SOUNDS REALLY NICE.
30%, WE GOT IT.
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
DONE.
DONE.
ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHS ] THAT'S RIGHT.
NO, MAN. YOU GOOD. YOU GOOD.
APPRECIATE YOU, SIR.
APPRECIATE IT.
YOU BETTER BE TELLING ME THE
TRUTH, OR I'M COMING AFTER YOU.
MY MAN, YOU WILL NOT
BE DISAPPOINTED.
JUST WAIT
TILL YOU SEE IT.
AND IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME,
I'M JUST GONNA RUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
Scott: THE THING THAT HAS
ALWAYS MOTIVATED ME IS
TO MAKE PEOPLE PROUD.
AND I WANT BOTH MARK AND DAYMOND
TO SEE, AT THE END OF ALL THIS,
THAT, "MAN, BRYAN CAME THROUGH.
HE REALLY MADE US PROUD."
