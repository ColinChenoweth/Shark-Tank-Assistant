I'M PAT BOONE.
OH!
HO, HO!
WE CAME HERE
TO MAKE A DEAL.
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...
WHOA!
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...
I WANT TO BRING THIS
TO THE AMERICAN MARKET.
WHY DID NOBODY
THINK OF THIS BEFORE?
NOBODY'S AS SMART AS ME.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
Tucker: HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS
ETHAN TUCKER,
LOOK, PAT, I KNOW YOU'VE SOLD
OVER 40 MILLION RECORDS.
THEY SAY.
I DIDN'T GET PAID THAT MANY,
BUT YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST HIT?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
SO, ETHAN, WHERE --
Greiner:
IN THE UNITED STATES?
YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN
HOW IT'S POWERED.
IS THIS COMPRESSED AIR?
IT IS COMPRESSED AIR.
IT IS NOT
A COMBUSTION PRINCIPLE.
IT IS
A PROPULSION PRINCIPLE.
NOW, A CRUDE WAY TO ILLUSTRATE
WOULD BE BLOW UP A BALLOON.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
PBBBBTH.
IT TAKES OFF.
PAT, HOW FAST DOES
THE LUNCHBOX ON WHEELS GO?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WOULD GO ABOUT
50 MILES AN HOUR, TOPS.
Herjavec:
IT IS SELF-PERPETUATING?
IN OTHER WORDS, IS THERE A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPRESSED AIR
WITHIN THE VEHICLE TO LAST
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME?
YOU PLUG IN THE AirPod
TO ANY OUTLET...
HE'S GOT 150 PATENTS.
HE KNOWS DEVELOPMENT.
SO HE'S A REAL CAR GUY.
HE LOVES CARS.
RIGHT.
WHAT WOULD IT COST FOR YOU
TO BRING YOUR CAR HERE?
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
MANUFACTURE IT HERE, I THOUGHT.
WE'RE GONNA MANUFACTURE
IN HAWAII.
YEAH,
WE'RE GONNA MANUFACTURE --
WE'RE BRINGING IT
TO THE UNITED STATES.
HAWAII?
THE $5 MILLION IS FOR
A PLANT TO BUI--
REGIONAL PLANT
TO BUILD THE CARS.
WHY HAWAII?
HAWAII IS A SORT OF
ENCLOSED COMMUNITY
WHERE THEY HAVE
POLLUTION PROBLEMS,
THEY HAVE
HIGH COST OF GAS,
PAT, CAN YOU SHARE
WHAT IT'S MADE OUT OF?
Boone:
AREAS, REGIONS, YEAH.
JUST SO WE CAN BE CRYSTAL-CLEAR
ON THE OPPORTUNITY.
YEAH.
I'M ASSUMING THAT I BECOME A 50%
PARTNER IN A PLANT IN HAWAII
PAT,
YOU GOT TO STOP SELLING
Cuban: PAT, DON'T TALK YOURSELF
OUT OF A DEAL.
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
A DECISION.
Greiner:
DOES THAT MEAN YES?
WE HAVE A DEAL!
OH, MY GOSH! YEAH!
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT AN HONOR
TO MEET YOU, PAT.
THANK YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU ARE THE PERFECT,
PERFECT PERSON.
I AM THE PERFECT PERSON
FOR THIS. I LOVE CARS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.
Cuban: CONGRATS.
Greiner: THANK YOU GUYS.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
Tucker: WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH
THE REINVENTION OF THE MOTOR,
THAT LEAP OF FAITH
IS THE LEAP
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON
THE GROUND FLOOR HAVE TO TAKE.
MM-HMM.
SO HE HAPPENED TO BE
ONE OF MY PATIENTS.
IS SEE MY DENTAL PATIENTS.
YOU'RE A DENTAL HYGIENIST.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
TEACHING CLASSES?
OH, JUST IN THE MORNING,
EARLY.
'CAUSE I HAVE TO START AROUND
4:00 IN THE MORNING.
YOU KNOW, I NEED HELP...
YOU THINK?
...BECAUSE WE'VE CREATED
A NICE FOUNDATION, MORE BARS,
I GOT THE DECIBEL LEVELS DOWN.
IT'S PART OF MY PATENT CLAIMS.
YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON THIS?
YEAH.
WELL, HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
I'VE SOLD 7,000 SO FAR.
THAT'S ALL.
7,000 UNITS?
YES.
HOW MUCH?
Greiner: FOR HOW MUCH?
IT RETAILS AT $6.35.
IT WHOLESALES AT --
SO YOUR SALES ARE AROUND, WHAT,
$40,000 OVER THREE YEARS?
ABOUT $55,000.
SO YOU'RE NOT
THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE WORLD.
THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.
I'M SORRY, $55,000 IN SALES
OVER THREE YEARS?
RIGHT.
John: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
SELLING THIS --
ONLINE
OR IN RETAIL STORES?
MOSTLY AT JUST
FISHING TRADE SHOWS.
THE POTENTIAL PATENT
THAT YOU COULD GO LICENSE
TO A LARGE PLAYER
THAT MAKES THIS STUFF?
'CAUSE YOU HAVE NO DISTRIBUTION,
YOU HAVE NO PACKAGING.
COULD DO THAT.
THIS IS MORE OF
AN INFOMERCIAL PLAY,
BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.
SO, WE HAVE SEVERAL
PROVISIONAL PATENTS PENDING.
GOING TO BE,
DO YOU ANTICIPATE?
IN THE STARTUP STAGE FOR TYPICAL
E-COMMERCE GLASSES COMPANIES,
IT'S $5 TO $15.
WHEN THEY MOVE INTO
THE GROWTH STAGE,
IT'S CLOSER
TO $20 TO $30.
OKAY, SO, LET'S TAKE
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO.
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH RUNWAY CASH
TO STAY ALIVE FOR 24 MONTHS,
IF IT'S A $25
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST?
YEAH, WHAT'S YOUR CASH-TO-DEBT
RIGHT NOW?
SO, OUR BURN RATE'S
ROUGHLY $38,000 A MONTH.
MOST OF IT GOES TO SALARY.
THAT'S PRETTY LEAN.
THAT'S PRETTY LEAN.
MY CHALLENGE IS, WE ALL UP HERE
HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTALS
IN WHAT WE BELIEVE
IN BUSINESS.
I'M A GUY WHO BELIEVES
THAT YOU SHOULD SHOW
THAT YOU HAVE PROOF OF CONCEPT,
THEN YOU BUILD A BUSINESS,
