I'M PAT BOONE.
OH!
HO, HO!
WE CAME HERE
TO MAKE A DEAL.
Narrator: IF THE SHARKS HEAR
A GREAT IDEA...
WHOA!
...THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...
I WANT TO BRING THIS
TO THE AMERICAN MARKET.
WHY DID NOBODY
THINK OF THIS BEFORE?
NOBODY'S AS SMART AS ME.
Narrator: ...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.
IF SOMEONE HAS A GOOD IDEA AND
COME IN HERE AND SELL US ON IT,
THEY CAN GET
AN INVESTOR.
MARK, WE DON'T HAVE TO
AGREE WITH YOU.
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
WHY AREN'T YOU TAKING
THE OFFER?
DO YOU HAVE $200 MILLION
YOU'D LIKE TO PLOP DOWN?
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE TEARS.
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD A BAKERY
BEFORE TASTING THE CAKE.
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
FIRST UP IS
A REVOLUTIONARY NEW WAY
TO POWER TRANSPORTATION.
OH!
HO, HO!
[ CHUCKLES ]
Tucker: HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS
ETHAN TUCKER,
AND I'M FROM THE BEAUTIFUL
GREEN MOUNTAINS
OF BRATTLEBORO, VERMONT.
AND I'M PAT BOONE,
AGING SINGER
AND, LIKE YOU,
A LIFELONG ENTREPRENEUR.
OUR COMPANY
IS ZERO POLLUTION MOTORS,
AND WE ARE SEEKING
$5 MILLION
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 50% OF OUR COMPANY.
OUR GOAL
IS TO GIVE TO AMERICA
THE LEANEST, CLEANEST, GREENEST
FORM OF AUTO TRANSPORTATION
EVER TO HIT
OUR CROWDED, POLLUTED CITIES.
SO, SHARKS,
IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE
TO INTRODUCE TO YOU...
THE AIR CAR.
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: THE WHAT?
THE CAR THAT RUNS
ON AIR.
WOW.
THAT'S RIGHT, AIR,
BUT HIGHLY COMPRESSED AIR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE IT IS.
AIR, OF COURSE,
IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE,
MOST READILY AVAILABLE,
AND THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY
PERFECT FUEL
THAT WILL EVER BE,
AND THE AirPod
USES COMPRESSED AIR
TO DRIVE THE PISTONS
IN THE ENGINE.
WHAT?
IT IS FAR SUPERIOR
TO THE ELECTRIC CAR
BECAUSE OF ITS PRICE
AND IT ELIMINATES THE NEED
FOR BATTERIES,
WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE
AND INEFFICIENT.
LOOK AT THAT THING GO.
NOW, THIS IS
A PICTURE WE TOOK,
WHICH IS NOT
TOTALLY LIFE-SIZE.
THIS IS JUST
THE FIRST PROTOTYPE.
AND, SO, HOW MANY
WANT TO JOIN US
FOR A DAZZLING RIDE
INTO THE FUTURE?
LOOK, PAT, I KNOW YOU'VE SOLD
OVER 40 MILLION RECORDS.
THEY SAY.
I DIDN'T GET PAID THAT MANY,
BUT YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST HIT?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
"LOVE LETTERS
IN THE SAND."
YOU KNOW, I LOVE CARS.
I DO.
I RACE CARS.
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET IN IT
AND TRY IT?
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL --
WHY ISN'T IT HERE?
I KNOW, WE WOULD LIKE YOU
TO BE IN IT,
AND THERE'S
SEVERAL REASONS.
ONE IS THAT THE CAR, TO COME
INTO THE UNITED STATES,
HAS TO MEET
SAFETY STANDARDS.
IT HAS IN EUROPE
ALREADY.
OH, SO THIS IS ALREADY
A PRODUCTION CAR.
IT IS MOVING
INTO PRODUCTION.
AND YOU'VE BOUGHT
THE LICENSE TO IT,
OR YOU WANT TO BUY
THE LICENSING?
WE HAVE THE RIGHT
TO BUILD THE FIRST PLANT
IN THE UNITED STATES.
SO, ETHAN, WHERE --
Greiner:
IN THE UNITED STATES?
YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN
HOW IT'S POWERED.
IS THIS COMPRESSED AIR?
IT IS COMPRESSED AIR.
IT IS NOT
A COMBUSTION PRINCIPLE.
IT IS
A PROPULSION PRINCIPLE.
NOW, A CRUDE WAY TO ILLUSTRATE
WOULD BE BLOW UP A BALLOON.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
PBBBBTH.
IT TAKES OFF.
PAT, HOW FAST DOES
THE LUNCHBOX ON WHEELS GO?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WOULD GO ABOUT
50 MILES AN HOUR, TOPS.
Herjavec:
IT IS SELF-PERPETUATING?
IN OTHER WORDS, IS THERE A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPRESSED AIR
WITHIN THE VEHICLE TO LAST
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME?
YOU PLUG IN THE AirPod
TO ANY OUTLET...
OKAY.
...AND IT TAKES
FOUR HOURS TO CHARGE.
THE MOTOR CHARGES ITSELF.
IT COMPRESSES THE AIR.
HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?
YOU HAVE
100 MILES RANGE.
I'M A CONSUMER.
I'M COMING TO A STORE TO BUY
AN AIR CAR OR A BATTERY CAR.
OKAY.
YEAH.
TELL ME WHY
I'M GONNA BUY THE AIR CAR.
THERE'S ONE
BIG DIFFERENCE.
TELL ME.
OTHER THAN THE PRICE --
TELL ME!
I'LL TELL YOU!
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
THE DIFFERENCE IS, IF THERE'S
A COMPRESSOR AT A GAS STATION,
JUST LIKE YOU FILL UP
YOUR TIRES,
YOU CAN FILL UP YOUR CAR
IN FOUR MINUTES.
WHAT'S THE COST?
$10,000.
$10,000 FOR
THE AIR CAR?
THE CAR COSTS $10,000?
THE CAR COSTS $10,000?
THAT'S IT?
YEAH.
THAT'S IT!
SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE.
NO, BECAUSE
IT'S VERY SIMPLY MADE.
THE INVENTOR -- YOU MAY KNOW
THE NAME -- GUY NEGRE.
YEAH, DOESN'T -- ISN'T HE
THE GUY WHO DEVELOPED THE...
TITANIUM PISTON.
TITANIUM
FOR A LIGHTER MOTOR.
HE'S GOT 150 PATENTS.
HE KNOWS DEVELOPMENT.
SO HE'S A REAL CAR GUY.
HE LOVES CARS.
RIGHT.
WHAT WOULD IT COST FOR YOU
TO BRING YOUR CAR HERE?
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
MANUFACTURE IT HERE, I THOUGHT.
WE'RE GONNA MANUFACTURE
IN HAWAII.
YEAH,
WE'RE GONNA MANUFACTURE --
WE'RE BRINGING IT
TO THE UNITED STATES.
HAWAII?
THE $5 MILLION IS FOR
A PLANT TO BUI--
REGIONAL PLANT
TO BUILD THE CARS.
WHY HAWAII?
HAWAII IS A SORT OF
ENCLOSED COMMUNITY
WHERE THEY HAVE
POLLUTION PROBLEMS,
THEY HAVE
HIGH COST OF GAS,
AND IT'S MORE OF
A CONTROLLED PLACE.
PART OF THE CONCEPT
OF THE COMPANY
IS NOT A BIG
DETROIT-TYPE PLANT.
IT IS REGIONAL PLANTS,
SMALL PLANTS,
BUILDING CARS
FOR THAT AREA.
PAT, CAN YOU SHARE
WHAT IT'S MADE OUT OF?
FIBERGLASS, POLYURETHANE,
AND RESIN.
YOU CAN JUMP ON A DOOR,
AND IT WON'T BEND
LIKE A REGULAR CAR.
BUT WHAT ABOUT
IN A CRASH TEST?
SO, WE CAN'T PASS A CRASH TEST
UNTIL WE'VE CRASHED A CAR,
AND WE DON'T WANT TO CRASH
A PROTOTYPE.
WE ONLY HAVE
THREE PROTOTYPES,
SO WE WOULD BE CRASHING --
TESTING A CAR
THAT WAS BUILT FROM SCRATCH.
$5 MILLION TO BUILD YOUR FACTORY
IN HAWAII.
THEN YOU HAVE TO MARKET IT,
RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH.
AND NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO
LET PEOPLE KNOW IT EXISTS,
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE THEM
THAT THEY CAN TRUST IT.
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
WE'RE IN HAWAII --
BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO IT
SLOWLY.
OKAY, SO YOUR LICENSE IS NOT FOR
ALL OF THE UNITED STATES
ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS.
NO, IT'S FOR
THIS ONE PLANT.
THE COMPANY'S CALLED MDI,
AND THEY'VE JUST MADE A DEAL
WITH TATA MOTORS FOR INDIA,
A $30 MILLION DEAL,
SO THEY WRAPPED UP INDIA.
AND THE MDI COMPANY
HAS ALL OF FRANCE.
SO, THEY'RE ONLY ISSUING
A COUPLE PLANTS PER TERRITORY?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
Boone:
AREAS, REGIONS, YEAH.
JUST SO WE CAN BE CRYSTAL-CLEAR
ON THE OPPORTUNITY.
YEAH.
I'M ASSUMING THAT I BECOME A 50%
PARTNER IN A PLANT IN HAWAII
AND THAT I OWN
THAT ENTIRE TERRITORY.
EVERY CAR SOLD
ON EVERY ISLAND IN HAWAII
IS COMING FROM THAT PLANT.
IS THAT TRUE?
YES.
BUT IF SOMEBODY BUILDS A PLANT
IN SAN FRANCISCO
AND SHIPS A CAR
INTO MY TERRITORY --
NOT ALLOWED.
CANNOT HAPPEN.
GUYS, GUYS, I'M GONNA
SIMPLIFY THINGS HERE, RIGHT?
THE SMART THING, AS AN INVESTOR,
IS TO JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
WITH TATA MOTORS IN INDIA,
SEE HOW IT SELLS,
LOOK AT THEIR EXPERIENCE,
AND THEN, IF IT GOES GOOD, WATCH
SOMEBODY ELSE OPEN UP A PLANT --
YOU'RE TOO LATE. THIS IS
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
THIS WAVE IS CRESTING.
IF IT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.
YOU'D ALREADY HAVE THE MONEY
AND HAVE THE PLANT OPEN.
NO, IT'S --
GUYS, I'M OUT.
THE STRATEGY
OF TRYING TO BUY A LICENSE
FOR A SINGLE PLANT
IS ALMOST LUDICROUS.
IF YOU CAN'T TIE UP
AN ENTIRE REGION,
YOU'RE BUYING THE RIGHT
TO BECOME A DEALER IN HAWAII.
YOU'VE GOT TO LOCK UP
ALL OF UNITED STATES.
DO YOU HAVE $200 MILLION YOU'D
LIKE TO PLOP DOWN FOR THAT?
YOU BECOME THE PIONEERS.
YOU ESTABLISH A REGION
FOR $5 MILLION,
PROVE THE MODEL,
AND SOMEBODY ELSE SCOOPS
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.
THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME
AS AN INVESTOR.
WE WILL BE THE FIRST.
I GET IT --
BUT NOT THE LAST.
AND WE HAVE
THE INSIDE CONNECTION TO MDI.
I CAN GO TO MDI
AND SIMPLY DO A DEAL RIGHT NOW,
WITHOUT YOU,
FOR NEW YORK.
WELL, HERE'S MY ANSWER
TO THAT.
TRY, BECAUSE OUR --
WHY, 'CAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
MY CAR IN NEW YORK OR MY MONEY?
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO BE
DOUBLE-CROSSED.
THERE'S A TRUST FACTOR.
OUR COMPANY --
YOU COULD NOT GO DIRECTLY
TO GUY AND SAY,
"I'M GONNA PLOP DOWN
$5 MILLION,"
AND COMPLETELY
DOUBLE-CROSS US.
Herjavec:
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,
THEIR COMPANY GETS IN TROUBLE
ROBERT IS PAT AND ETHAN'S
LAST CHANCE FOR A DEAL
FOR THEIR AIR-PROPELLED VEHICLE,
AIR CAR.
I'VE INVESTED IN
A LOT OF THINGS,
AND I'M WILLING TO INVEST
IN THIS, TOO.
LOOK, I'M INTERESTED.
I'M -- I'M REALLY INTERESTED.
AND HE'S FULL OF HOT AIR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH!
IT'S A LOW-COST COMMUTER CAR
FOR $10,000 --
BIG MARKET FOR THAT.
MM-HMM.
THE $5 MILLION
ISN'T THAT MUCH,
CONSIDERING
THE SIZE OF THIS MARKET.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA SELL
ONE STATE AT A TIME,
MY FRIENDS.
THE MINUTE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
IN HAWAII,
SOMEBODY IS GONNA LOCK UP
THE OTHER STUFF.
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE AIR CARS
IN HAWAII.
I WANT TO BRING THIS
TO THE AMERICAN MARKET.
I'M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU $5 MILLION
FOR THE RIGHT
TO GO AND SIT AT
THAT TABLE AND NEGOTIATE
A DISTRIBUTION DEAL
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO OWN IT.
SO I'M GIVING YOU
$5 MILLION FOR 50%,
CONTINGENT ON BEING ABLE TO
NEGOTIATE AN AMERICAN-WIDE DEAL.
AND IF YOU DON'T GET
THAT DEAL...
WELL, IT'S CONTINGENT ON THAT,
'CAUSE I DON'T BUY --
THEN IT'S --
THE $5 MILLION GOES AWAY.
GUY NEGRE
WOULD BE THRILLED
TO HAVE YOU MAKE A DEAL
WITH HIM,
AND I FEEL VERY CERTAIN THAT
THAT NUMBER COULD COME DOWN,
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY,
HAVING THE U.S. RIGHTS
IS THE GOLDEN GOOSE.
RIGHT.
WHY ARE YOU EVEN
HESITATING?
WELL, I --
WE'RE NOT.
I WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER FILL-UP
THAT YOU WOULD BE PURCHASING,
AND THAT IS
THE GOLF CART.
PAT,
YOU GOT TO STOP SELLING
Cuban: PAT, DON'T TALK YOURSELF
OUT OF A DEAL.
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
A DECISION.
Greiner:
DOES THAT MEAN YES?
WE HAVE A DEAL!
OH, MY GOSH! YEAH!
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT AN HONOR
TO MEET YOU, PAT.
THANK YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU ARE THE PERFECT,
PERFECT PERSON.
I AM THE PERFECT PERSON
FOR THIS. I LOVE CARS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.
Cuban: CONGRATS.
Greiner: THANK YOU GUYS.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
Tucker: WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH
THE REINVENTION OF THE MOTOR,
THAT LEAP OF FAITH
IS THE LEAP
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON
THE GROUND FLOOR HAVE TO TAKE.
MM-HMM.
AND WE'VE BEEN PROVEN RIGHT
FOR OUR -- FOR TAKING THE JUMP.
HIGH FIVE, ROBERT.
I LIKE THAT.
AWESOME.
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE.
I HOPE THERE IS.
Narrator: EARLIER THIS SEASON,
WE SAW CHEF HEIDI LOVIG
MAKE A DEAL WITH LORI GREINER
FOR HER VEGAN-CHEESE COMPANY,
HEIDI HO.
Lovig:
WE'RE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
IN FOUR REGIONS
OF WHOLE FOODS MARKET.
I HAVE ALREADY SECURED GROWTH
INTO FIVE MORE REGIONS
WITH THEM,
AND I NEED WORKING CAPITAL
TO EXECUTE AGAINST THAT GROWTH.
Narrator:
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE'S UP TO NOW.
OH, MY GOSH,
BUSINESS HAS EXPLODED
SINCE BEING ON "SHARK TANK."
IN THE 12 MONTHS
LEADING UP TO "SHARK TANK,"
OUR SALES WERE $140,000.
IT'S ONLY BEEN FOUR MONTHS
SINCE BEING ON "SHARK TANK,"
AND OUR SALES ARE $750,000.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
SOME CHEESE?
TODAY, I AM IN CHICAGO
DOING AN IN-STORE DEMO,
BECAUSE THEY REALLY ALLOW ME
TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC
ABOUT OUR DELICIOUS
PLANT-BASED CHEESES.
I'D LIKE TO TRY
SOME CHEESE.
LORI!
[ LAUGHS ]
COME HERE!
HI!
Greiner: YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT HEIDI?
SHE'S SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS,
SHE'S HARDWORKING,
SHE'S SO TENACIOUS,
AND THE PRODUCT IS AMAZING.
SHE MAKES IT WITH LOVE.
I'M SO GLAD
THAT WE GOT INTO
OVER 300 WHOLE FOODS STORES
LIKE THAT.
IT'S REALLY NOT EASY TO BUILD
A BRAND AND A NAME FOR YOURSELF
IN THE NATURAL-FOOD INDUSTRY
WITH A PRODUCT
THAT'S SO UNIQUE
AND SO NEW TO SO MANY PEOPLE.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
REALLY GOOD, RIGHT?
LORI WAS THE SHARK THAT CAME IN
WHEN WE WERE SUPER VULNERABLE
AND TOOK A RISK ON US.
I LOVE HEIDI HO,
AND YOU'RE DOING AMAZING.
TOGETHER,
I KNOW WE WILL BECOME
THE NEXT BIG NAME
IN NATURAL FOOD.
SO HE HAPPENED TO BE
ONE OF MY PATIENTS.
AND I CALLED HIM AND SAID,
YOU KNOW,
"WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS BAR.
WE'RE GONNA CALL IT 'PALEO.'
WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
US USING THAT?"
DID YOU LICENSE IT
FROM HIM?
YEAH, HE HAS 5% OF THE COMPANY,
10% ROYALTIES.
IS SEE MY DENTAL PATIENTS.
YOU'RE A DENTAL HYGIENIST.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
TEACHING CLASSES?
OH, JUST IN THE MORNING,
EARLY.
'CAUSE I HAVE TO START AROUND
4:00 IN THE MORNING.
YOU KNOW, I NEED HELP...
YOU THINK?
...BECAUSE WE'VE CREATED
A NICE FOUNDATION, MORE BARS,
I GOT THE DECIBEL LEVELS DOWN.
IT'S PART OF MY PATENT CLAIMS.
YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON THIS?
YEAH.
WELL, HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
I'VE SOLD 7,000 SO FAR.
THAT'S ALL.
7,000 UNITS?
YES.
HOW MUCH?
Greiner: FOR HOW MUCH?
IT RETAILS AT $6.35.
IT WHOLESALES AT --
SO YOUR SALES ARE AROUND, WHAT,
$40,000 OVER THREE YEARS?
ABOUT $55,000.
SO YOU'RE NOT
THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE WORLD.
THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.
I'M SORRY, $55,000 IN SALES
OVER THREE YEARS?
RIGHT.
John: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
SELLING THIS --
ONLINE
OR IN RETAIL STORES?
MOSTLY AT JUST
FISHING TRADE SHOWS.
AND I'D WORKED MY BUTT OFF TO
MAKE THEM MYSELF IN MY BASEMENT.
WAIT, YOU'RE MAKING THESE
YOURSELF, STILL?
YEAH, I MADE --
WELL, NO, NOW I JUST GOT TO THE
POINT WHERE I GOT MY I.P. READY,
I GOT THE TRADEMARK NAME.
IS THAT YOUR RETAIL PACKAGING
RIGHT THERE?
IT'S A WHOLE BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT SIZES?
ACTUALLY, I MADE THAT
AS A DISPLAY.
I MADE THAT AS A DISPLAY.
I MADE IT MYSELF.
WHICH IS
THE RETAIL PACKAGE?
THERE IS NONE.
OH, IT'S THOSE LITTLE
PLASTIC PACKAGES IN FRONT.
Cuban: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME UNDERSTAND.
SO, BASICALLY,
YOU'RE NOT AN ENTREPRENEUR YET.
YOU'RE STILL A WANT-TREPRENEUR,
AND YOU'RE STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT.
THIS IS THE VERY BEGINNING
STAGES OF THIS COMPANY, YES.
OKAY, SO, IN
THE BAIT-AND-TACKLE BUSINESS...
MM-HMM.
...THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF VERY LARGE PLAYERS
THAT MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE
TO ALL THE TACKLE SHOPS
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
SO, IS IT REALLY
THE VALUE OF WHAT YOU'VE GOT,
THE POTENTIAL PATENT
THAT YOU COULD GO LICENSE
TO A LARGE PLAYER
THAT MAKES THIS STUFF?
'CAUSE YOU HAVE NO DISTRIBUTION,
YOU HAVE NO PACKAGING.
COULD DO THAT.
THIS IS MORE OF
AN INFOMERCIAL PLAY,
BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.
SO, WE HAVE SEVERAL
PROVISIONAL PATENTS PENDING.
WE HAVE THE UTILITY PATENT
ON THE LOCK-AND-KEY MECHANISM
OF HOW OUR LENS
SNAPS INTO THE FRAME.
TO ME, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU COULD GET A PATENT,
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN LENSES
THAT POP IN AND OUT.
SO, WE HAD TO COMPLETELY CHANGE
HOW THE FRAMES ARE MANUFACTURED.
THESE AREN'T INJECTION-MOLDED.
THESE ARE HANDMADE.
SO, WHERE WAS
THE PROPRIETARY PART?
THE PROPRIETARY PART
IS IN
HOW WE ACTUALLY CUT
THE INSIDE SOCKET OF THE FRAME.
THIS RING -- THERE'S
A TON OF TECHNOLOGY TO THIS.
IT TOOK US A YEAR
TO ENGINEER THIS.
SO, CAN I CHOOSE
MY FRAMES?
HOW DO I OPTIMIZE
AND EVEN MAKE MYSELF
EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN I AM?
FRAMES THAT MAKE YOU INVISIBLE,
MAYBE?
[ LAUGHS ]
I WAS WAITING
FOR YOU.
GOING TO BE,
DO YOU ANTICIPATE?
IN THE STARTUP STAGE FOR TYPICAL
E-COMMERCE GLASSES COMPANIES,
IT'S $5 TO $15.
WHEN THEY MOVE INTO
THE GROWTH STAGE,
IT'S CLOSER
TO $20 TO $30.
OKAY, SO, LET'S TAKE
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO.
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH RUNWAY CASH
TO STAY ALIVE FOR 24 MONTHS,
IF IT'S A $25
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST?
YEAH, WHAT'S YOUR CASH-TO-DEBT
RIGHT NOW?
SO, OUR BURN RATE'S
ROUGHLY $38,000 A MONTH.
MOST OF IT GOES TO SALARY.
THAT'S PRETTY LEAN.
THAT'S PRETTY LEAN.
MY CHALLENGE IS, WE ALL UP HERE
HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTALS
IN WHAT WE BELIEVE
IN BUSINESS.
I'M A GUY WHO BELIEVES
THAT YOU SHOULD SHOW
THAT YOU HAVE PROOF OF CONCEPT,
THEN YOU BUILD A BUSINESS,
AND YOU BRING IN INVESTORS ONCE
YOU PROVE THAT THE MODEL WORKS
AND YOU CAN RETURN MONEY.
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'RE FULL OF B.S. OR NOT,
SO I DON'T WANT
TO CHOP YOU DOWN.
I JUST HAVE
A VERY FUNNY FEELING
THAT YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT PERSON
FOR ME.
AND TO SUM IT ALL UP,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I REALLY APOLOGIZE
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY.
