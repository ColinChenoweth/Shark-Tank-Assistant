HI. I'M SHAUNA SLEDGE
FROM FORT COLLINS, COLORADO.
I LIVE WITH MY HUSBAND, TODD,
OUR TWO GIRLS,
STEPHANIE AND MEGHAN,
AND OUR LITTLE BOY, SKYLAR.
SO, I'M A WORKING MOM.
YOUR GUMS FEEL OKAY?
I'M A PART-TIME
DENTAL HYGIENIST.
COME ON!
I'M A GROUP-FITNESS
INSTRUCTOR.
GOOD JOB!
AND I HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS
THAT I RUN.
LIVING A HEALTHY
AND ACTIVE LIFESTYLE
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
A BIG PART OF BEING HEALTHY
IS WHAT YOU EAT,
AND I'M A TRUE BELIEVER
IN THE PALEO DIET.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S DIG IN.
THE PALEO DIET MIMICS THE DIET
OF OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS.
IT CONSISTS OF EATING
LEAN PROTEIN,
AVOIDING DAIRY, POTATOES,
LEGUMES, AND PROCESSED FOODS.
BASICALLY, IF THE CAVEMAN
DIDN'T HAVE IT, DON'T EAT IT.
WE WILL BE SHIPPING IT OUT
IN TWO DAYS.
WE'RE IN AN EXTREMELY
COMPETITIVE MARKET.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE I NEED
THE SHARKS AND THEIR INFLUENCE
AND THEIR CONNECTIONS
FOR US TO SURVIVE.
I'M A VERY COMPETITIVE PERSON,
AND I WON'T LET
THIS BUSINESS FAIL,
BECAUSE I HAVE
SO MANY PEOPLE COUNTING ON ME,
AND I WON'T LET THEM DOWN.
[ GASPS ]
[ Chuckling ] OH.
OH, LORD.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS SHAUNA SLEDGE.
I'M FROM FORT COLLINS, COLORADO,
AND OUR COMPANY
IS THE PALEO DIET FOODS.
WE ARE SEEKING JUST $150,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, WE NEED
A CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE.
WE NEED TO GO BACK
TO OUR ROOTS -- WAY BACK.
BACK THEN, IT WAS FORAGING
FOR BERRIES AND NUTS.
WELL, NOWADAYS,
IT'S FORAGING FOR ANYTHING
THAT DOESN'T CONTAIN
POTASSIUM BENZOATE
OR OTHER STUFF
THAT'S HARD TO PRONOUNCE.
WELL, FORAGE NO MORE,
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN
SEEKING IS IN ONE BAR --
THE PALEO DIET BAR...
...POWERED BY
17 GRAMS OF PROTEIN,
CONTAINING ALL NINE
ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS.
IT'S FREE OF GLUTEN.
IT'S FREE OF SOY, DAIRY.
SO, TO BE A PART
OF THE PALEOLITHIC MOVEMENT
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO LIVE
LIKE YOU'RE IN
THE PALEOLITHIC ERA.
JUST REACH FOR
THE PALEO DIET BAR.
IT'S PACKED WITH RAW,
ALL-NATURAL INGREDIENTS...
[ LAUGHTER ]
...THAT, WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
THIS GUY EVEN RECOGNIZES.
OUR PRODUCT IS
THE ONLY EVER ENDORSED PRODUCT
BY DR. LOREN CORDAIN,
THE FOUNDER OF
THE PALEOLITHIC MOVEMENT.
SO COME ON, SHARKS,
LET'S DO THIS!
ARE YOU GUYS READY
TO EAT NATURALLY?
YEAH.
LET'S TRY IT.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, WHAT I'M THRILLED
TO FIND OUT
IS THAT CAVEMEN HAD TO
WEAR WEDDING RINGS, TOO.
[ LAUGHS ]
I KIND OF KNOW THAT GUY.
YOU DO?
IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND?
Sledge:MM, IT IS.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN.
IS THERE NUTS?
YES, THERE ARE.
THEY'RE ONLY TREE NUTS.
THERE'S NO PEANUTS,
BECAUSE IT'S PALEO DIET.
SHAUNA,
IT TASTES GREAT.
THANK YOU.
MOST OF THE PROTEIN STUFF I EAT
TASTES PRETTY CRAPPY.
IT'S 17 GRAMS
OF EGG-WHITE PROTEIN.
WHY SO MUCH SUGAR?
WELL, IT'S THE FRUIT.
IT HAS PRETTY EQUAL ENERGIES
OF CARBS, PROTEIN, AND FAT,
SO IT KIND OF OFFSETS
ONE ANOTHER.
SHAUNA, WHAT'S IN THIS ONE,
THE ONE YOU CUT UP?
THERE'S CRANBERRIES, RAISINS,
ALMONDS, SUNFLOWERS,
EGG-WHITE PROTEIN.
IT'S GOOD, THOUGH.
SO, HAVE YOU HEARD
OF THE PALEO DIET?
TELL ME ABOUT
THE PALEO DIET.
I HAVE.
O'Leary:
SHAUNA, YOU LOOK PRETTY BUFF.
ARE YOU ON THE PALEO DIET?
I AM.
I AM ALSO A FITNESS INSTRUCTOR,
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT KIND OF GOT US
IN THE INDUSTRY.
SO, PALEO'S
BASICALLY A LIFESTYLE.
YOU'RE GETTING RID
OF REFINED SUGARS.
YOU GET RID OF
LEGUMES AND POTATOES,
DAIRY, AND THEN GRAINS.
SO, BASICALLY,
YOU EAT LIKE A CAVEMAN.
CAVEWOMAN. [ GRUNTS ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'RE BUFF.
YEAH.
WELL, AND, SO,
I AM A GROUP-FITNESS INSTRUCTOR.
HOW MANY HOURS A DAY
ARE YOU TEACHING CLASSES?
JUST ONE NOW.
I USED TO TEACH A LOT MORE,
BUT I HAVE THREE KIDS,
AND THEN WE HAVE THIS COMPANY.
[ Laughing ] THREE KIDS.
SO, SHAUNA, HOW DID YOU GO FROM
A FITNESS INSTRUCTOR,
THREE KIDS, TO THIS BAR?
WELL, IN FORT COLLINS,
THE DOCTOR, DR. CORDAIN,
WHO INVENTED THE PALEO DIET,
LIVES THERE.
AND MY PROFESSIONAL TRAINING
IS A DENTAL HYGIENIST,
SHAUNA,
DO YOU HAVE SALES?
THE TOTAL SALES
ARE $135,000.
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
Greiner: JUST IN WHOLE FOODS,
OR ARE YOU OTHER PLACES?
WE ARE IN OVER 350
BRICK-AND-MORTAR LOCATIONS.
WHY AREN'T YOU IN
MORE WHOLE FOODS?
OH, SO, WE ARE.
SO, THAT'S PART OF
WHY I NEED YOU GUYS,
BECAUSE I WANT TO BRING ON
A BROKER.
AND, SO, WE HAVE THEM
ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE
FOR A VERY
SHOESTRING BUDGET.
WHAT DOES IT COST
TO MAKE A BAR,
AND WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
THE HARD COST --
THAT'S, LIKE, SHIPPING, PALLET,
GET IT TO MY WAREHOUSE --
WAS $1.09 PER BAR.
SO IT'S $1.09 PER BAR.
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
AND, SO, RETAIL IS $2.99.
SEEMS LOW.
WE'RE WORKING ON OUR MARGINS.
WE'RE AT 25%.
AND ANOTHER REASON
I NEED YOU GUYS --
'CAUSE I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HELP
ME NEGOTIATE OUR BUYING POWER.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES ONLINE,
SHAUNA?
OUR ONLINE SALES
ARE ABOUT $45,000.
YOU HAVE GREAT ENERGY,
BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
OKAY.
I DON'T LIKE
THE TASTE OF THE BAR.
I JUST REALLY DON'T LIKE
THE TASTE OF THE BAR...
AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T.
...AND, SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I MUST GO OUT.
OKAY.
AND, YOU KNOW,
I THINK, AS WE GROW,
WE CAN MAYBE TWEAK THE TASTE,
YOU KNOW --
SHAUNA,
I LIKE THE TASTE.
IT TASTES BETTER THAN
SOME OF THE OTHER STUFF.
BUT LET'S
GO BACK TO THIS.
IS THIS
YOUR FULL-TIME JOB?
IT IS.
THE ONLY THING I DO
ON THURSDAY AFTERNOONS
AND SO I CAN'T BACKTRACK.
SHAUNA --
I THINK -- I THINK YOU'RE
SPREADING YOURSELF TOO THIN,
BUT YOU'RE ALSO
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
I HONESTLY AM.
AND I'M LIKE,
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME,
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
HAVE ALL BEEN THERE.
YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW THE
DETERMINATION AND WHAT IT TAKES.
[ Voice breaking ]
AND I KNOW I AM BUSY.
I AM.
BUT I WON'T LET IT DIE,
BECAUSE DR. CORDAIN WAS BEING
COURTED BY TWO MAJOR COMPANIES,
ONE IN CHICAGO --
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE TEARS.
[ INHALES SHARPLY ]
ONE IN CHICAGO
AND ONE IN BOSTON.
AND HE TRUSTS US, BECAUSE
WE WILL DO RIGHT BY HIM.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT TAKE
A LITTLE BIT LONGER
WITHOUT YOU GUYS,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA STOP.
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU
BY MY SIDE --
YOU KNOW, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN
THE PALEO DIET.
SHAUNA, I'VE BEEN
QUIETLY LISTENING TO YOU.
I KNOW.
I'M SCARED OF THAT.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY,
AND IT SPRAYS OUT OF YOU
LIKE THE SUN IN 360 DIRECTIONS,
RIGHT?
YOU'RE LIKE A SUPERNOVA JUST
BLOWING UP IN EVERY DIRECTION.
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD IN BUSINESS.
YOU GOT TO HAVE A FOCUS.
I THINK, PERSONALLY, THE ONLINE
STRATEGY WOULD BE BETTER.
IT'S FULL MARGIN.
YOU HAVE A BRAND
ON A SEARCH BASIS.
YOU KNOW, NUT BARS LIKE CUBAN
WHO WANT TO EAT ROCKS --
THIS IS WHAT HE GOES FOR.
THIS IS THE STUFF.
THOSE HARD-CORE PEOPLE
ARE SEARCHING YOU OUT
'CAUSE YOU OWN THE BRAND,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HEARING.
I'M HEARING A LOT OF,
YOU KNOW --
A LOT OF DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS.
YOU'RE SCATTERED.
YOU ARE.
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T FIX YOURSELF,
OR MAYBE FIND A SHARK
THAT'S GONNA SIT DOWN
AND HARNESS YOUR ENERGY.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE ME.
I'M OUT.
HERE'S MY ISSUE.
I DON'T THINK YOU DO ENOUGH.
I THINK DENTAL HYGIENIST,
FITNESS INSTRUCTOR,
MOM OF THREE, WIFE,
AND YOU HAVE PALEO.
YOU COULD DO MORE
WITH YOUR DAY.
I WORK AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING
TILL WHATEVER AT NIGHT.
NO, I GOT IT. I --
I MANAGE IT.
I HAVE THE DAY.
EVERY MINUTE YOU SPEND
DOING ONE THING,
YOU'RE MAKING A CONSCIOUS CHOICE
NOT TO DO ANOTHER THING.
AND SO --
AND I'M NOT SAYING
THAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG,
BUT BE GREAT AT
ONE THING.
DON'T TRY TO BE GREAT
AT MULTIPLE THINGS.
I'M NOT SEEING THAT
IN YOUR PITCH TODAY.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE THIS THING WORK,
BUT YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT
ALL OVER THE PLACE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE CAME INTO
THIS ROOM LASER-FOCUSED,
AND I CAN'T TAKE THIS RIDE
WITH YOU AT THE MOMENT.
I'M OUT.
MARK.
I CAN DO THIS.
I CAN BE LASER-FOCUSED,
AND IF IT REQUIRES ME GIVING UP
TEACHING AND HYGIENE,
THEY ALL UNDERSTAND.
I'M JUST A VERY LOYAL PERSON.
IT HAS TO DO WITH LOYALTY.
Cuban: I KNOW YOU ARE.
WE CAN TELL.
LOOK, I'M A BIG BELIEVER
IN PALEO, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
I MEAN, I INVESTED IN
A COMPANY CALLED CHAPUL...
OH, YES.
...WHICH IS CRICKETS --
CRICKET-BASED PROTEIN.
IT'S ABOUT AS PALEO
AS YOU CAN GET, RIGHT?
OH, YEAH.
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
DR. CORDAIN'S ENDORSEMENT.
NO, THEY DON'T.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S KIND OF
MY DISAPPOINTMENT,
BECAUSE HAVING THAT AND
HAVING THE NAME IS PHENOMENAL
AS AN OPPORTUNITY.
AND WE WANT
TO GROW THE BRAND.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET THERE,
AND THAT'S PART
OF THE PROBLEM,
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'VE HEDGED
YOUR BET SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
I DIDN'T LIKE THE BARS.
AND I THINK THEY HAVE
TOO MUCH SUGAR IN THEM.
AND WE CAN TWEAK THAT.
YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO THE --
I CAN'T COME IN
AND REDESIGN YOUR PRODUCT.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
Greiner:
EVERYBODY'S OUT, UNFORTUNATELY.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I WISH YOU THE BEST.
I WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST.
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK, CAVEMAN.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
DANG IT.
Sledge: [ Crying ]
I JUST -- I FELT DISAPPOINTED.
TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON
THE SUCCESS OF THE PALEO DIET,
AND I WILL NEVER GIVE UP,
BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, IF IT WEREN'T FOR
MY COMMUNITY AND MY FAMILY
AND DR. CORDAIN,
WE WOULDN'T BE WHERE WE ARE NOW,
AND I CAN'T GIVE UP ON THEM.
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP ON THEM.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
WHO HOPES TO LURE THE SHARKS
WITH A BIG FISH.
