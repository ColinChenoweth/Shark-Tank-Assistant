HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS GREG MYERSON.
AND I'M FROM
WALLINGFORD, CONNECTICUT.
MY COMPANY IS THE WORLD RECORD
STRIPER COMPANY,
AND I'M SEEKING $75,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
SHARKS, I'M A FISHERMAN --
A DARN GOOD ONE.
THAT'S BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT TO CATCH BIG FISH,
YOU HAVE TO USE THE RIGHT BAIT.
SO IF I'M FISHING FOR A SHARK,
I'M PROBABLY GONNA USE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
[ CUBAN LAUGHS ]
THERE YOU GO.
WHOA!
YEAH, I FIGURED
YOU COULD USE SOME CASH.
COME ON!
Cuban:
THAT'S REAL MONEY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M THROWING THAT ONE BACK.
IT'S ONES.
BUT WHEN I'M FISHING FOR FISH,
I USE MY VERY OWN PRODUCT --
THE GREG MYERSON RattleSinker.
THE RattleSinker ATTRACTS
BIG FISH TO YOUR HOOK
BY MIMICKING THE SOUNDS
OF FISH'S FAVORITE FOODS.
[ SINKER RATTLING ]
YOU HEAR THAT?
TO A FISH, THAT'S THE SOUND
OF A DINNER BELL RINGING.
MY PRODUCT HAS MADE ME
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS FISHERMEN
IN THE WORLD, AND HERE'S WHY.
SHARKS, THAT'S THE 82-POUND
WORLD-RECORD STRIPED BASS.
YOU CAUGHT THAT?
YES, I DID --
THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER
WORLD RECORD
IN ALL THE FISHING WORLD.
Together: WOW.
WOW, THAT COULD HAVE
KNOCKED OVER YOUR BOAT.
SO, SHARKS, IT TOOK 29 YEARS
FOR THAT RECORD TO FALL
AND ABOUT AN HOUR
FOR ME TO REEL IT IN.
I HOPE IT DOESN'T TAKE ME
THAT LONG
TO NET A DEAL
WITH ONE OF YOU.
I GOT SOME PRODUCT
TO SHOW YOU.
THANK YOU, GREG.
YES, SIR.
OKAY.
[ SINKERS RATTLING ]
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A RATTLE.
YES, IT IS A RATTLE.
DID YOU CATCH THAT FISH
USING THIS PRODUCT?
YES, I DID.
AND I HAVE THREE OTHER
WORLD RECORDS WITH THAT PRODUCT.
STRIPED BASS IS
AMERICA'S FISH.
IT'S THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER
WORLD RECORD.
WHY?
WHY?
'CAUSE IT'S
THE EVERYMAN QUALITY.
EVERYBODY CAN FISH FOR THIS.
YOU DON'T NEED A YACHT.
YOU CAN FISH FROM SHORE.
I GO TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD
EVERY SUMMER...
YEAH?
...AND THAT IS
THE FISHERMAN'S DREAM THERE,
IS THE STRIPED BASS.
ABSOLUTELY.
WELL, THIS PRODUCT CATCHES
MORE THAN STRIPED BASS.
IT CATCHES ALL FISH.
SO, WHY IS THIS THE BEST THING
TO USE IN THE WORLD...
THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION.
...AND WHY DID THAT CATCH
THAT SIZE FISH?
GOOD QUESTION.
I'VE BEEN A FISHERMAN
MY WHOLE LIFE.
I STARTED FISHING WHEN
I WAS AGE 2 IN THE SEWER --
AND PROBABLY A GOOD THING
I NEVER CAUGHT ANYTHING THERE.
BUT AT 8, I MADE A FLY
OUT OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S PARROT.
AND I HATED THAT THING.
IT ALWAYS ATTACKED ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND WHEN IT DIED, SHE SAID,
"WOULD YOU BURY IT FOR ME?"
I SAID, "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH."
I TIED 12 FLIES OUT OF IT.
I CAUGHT A TROUT.
IT PUT ME ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE TOWN NEWSPAPER.
[ LAUGHS ]
WITH HER DEAD PARROT?
WITH THE FLIES I MADE
FROM HER FEATHERS, YEAH.
I BECAME, LIKE,
A CELEBRITY IN TOWN.
I HAD THIS BIG TROUT.
OH, YOU ARE THE MAN.
SO, WHEN I CAME UP WITH
THIS PRODUCT,
I KNEW THAT THESE FISH
ARE SOUND-DRIVEN.
THEY HUNT THROUGH SOUND
AND VIBRATION FIRST.
THEY'RE ALL NEARSIGHTED.
SO, YOU PULL IT ALONG...
YEP.
...AND IT MAKES
THIS SOUND...
THAT'S RIGHT.
...AS IT'S GOING ALONG
THE BOTTOM?
IT'S TRICKING THE FISH --
ABSOLUTELY, IT'S TRICKING
THE FISH INTO THINKING
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE
THAT IT ISN'T.
WHY DID NOBODY
THINK OF THIS BEFORE?
NOBODY'S AS SMART AS ME.
GREG,
THIS IS JUST...
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ] I LIKE YOU --
HUMBLE, THE HUMBLEBRAG.
Greiner: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
SELLING THESE,
AND WHERE
ARE YOU SELLING THESE?
I JUST STARTED SELLING THEM
TWO YEARS AGO.
WHEN I BROKE THE WORLD RECORD,
I MEAN, THAT WAS
MY SECRET WEAPON FOR YEARS.
YOU KNOW, I DID A LOT
OF RESEARCH ON THE SOUND.
YEAH, IS THAT PART OF
THE PROBLEM, GREG --
WELL, YOU HAVE TO
HEAR IT.
AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT IT'S ACOUSTICS.
IT WOULD SIT THERE,
YOU KNOW?
THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM.
I REALLY WASN'T READY
TO MASS-PRODUCE IT YET.
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING, AND FOR --
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU?
THE 5-OUNCE RETAILS
AT $6.45.
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
$2.50.
I'M GONNA SIMPLIFY
THIS WHOLE THING, RIGHT?
I INVESTED IN A COMPANY
CALLED SHELL BOBBERS.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU THE EXACT
SAME OFFER I MADE TO THEM --
$80,000 FOR 33%.
OKAY.
THAT'S A GREAT OFFER.
YOU'LL STILL BE
THE FRONT MAN.
YOU'LL STILL DO
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU DO,
RIGHT, IN DEVELOPING IT
AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER.
SURE.
BUT LET THEM TAKE OVER
THE WHOLE THING.
THE SHELL BOBBER GUYS?
THE SHELL BOBBER GUYS, YEAH,
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN WALMART.
THEY KNOW HOW TO SELL.
YOU GOT TO SAY
YES OR NO.
WHY AREN'T YOU TAKING
THE OFFER?
I LIKE THE OFFER --
BEFORE WE SHAKE ON IT,
COULD I HEAR WHAT
THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
GREG, I'LL MAKE IT REALLY EASY.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
John: LET ME MAKE IT
EVEN EASIER FOR YOU.
YOU BETTER TAKE
THAT OFFER NOW.
WELL, WAIT -- GREG, LET ME
GIVE YOU AN OFFER HERE.
OH, MY GOD.
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
SHELL BOBBER
IS THE BIGGEST PLAYER.
YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION.
YOUR MONEY'S ON THE TABLE, GREG.
GREG, IT'S YOUR MOMENT!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
'CAUSE THE MINUTE HE SPITS OUT
THAT OFFER, I'M OUT.
YOUR FELLOW FISHERMAN IS TELLING
YOU YOU'D BETTER TAKE THIS.
YOU KNOW, THESE OPPORTUNITIES
ONLY COME AROUND
ONCE IN A LIFETIME.
? DUN, DUH, DUN, DUH ?
MARK,
I'LL TAKE THE DEAL.
YOU GOT IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
John: OH, MY GOD.
THANK YOU, MAN.
YEAH, IT'LL BE GREAT.
ONE WORLD CHAMP
TO ANOTHER, MAN.
ABSOLUTELY, MAN.
WE'LL HAVE FUN WITH IT.
THANK YOU.
YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER HEARD
HOW MUCH YOU WERE GONNA MAKE.
THAT'S RIGHT,
'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T.
I APPRECIATE IT.
GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU GUYS.
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CONGRATS, CHAMP.
Myerson:
AS A KID, GROWING UP FISHING,
CATCHING A WORLD RECORD, NOW
GETTING A DEAL ON "SHARK TANK."
MAN, WHO'S BETTER THAN ME, HUH?
THIS IS GREAT. I LOVE THIS.
YES!
LORI,
WHEN DID YOU GO FISHING?
I HAVE BEEN FISHING
MANY TIMES -- WITH LEECHES.
WITH LEECHES?
YEAH.
