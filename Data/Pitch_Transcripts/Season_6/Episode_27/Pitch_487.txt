KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,
FOUNDED ONE OF
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
AND KEVIN COMES ALONG WITH A
$5 MILLION OFFER FOR THE RIGHTS.
$5 MILLION, TO GUY,
IS SMALL POTATOES.
THE WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK
IS TO SIT DOWN
AND COME UP WITH
A NATIONAL STRATEGY
FOR THE ENTIRE U.S. MARKET
AND THEN PACKAGE THAT UP
AND BRING IT TO INVESTORS.
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD A BAKERY
BEFORE TASTING THE CAKE.
THAT'S RIGHT, BUT WE'RE
GONNA ALLOW OTHERS
TO TASTE THE CAKE.
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.
I KNOW THE CHALLENGES
OF ALL THE LEGAL ISSUES,
BRINGING A PRODUCT TO MARKET
LIKE THIS.
IT COULD TAKE FOREVER,
AND IT'S TOO EARLY FOR ME,
WITHOUT YOUR ABILITY
TO ACTUALLY GET CLEARANCE
TO HAVE THIS OPERATE IN AMERICA,
SO BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW,
I LIKE GREEN PRODUCTS.
I THINK THAT THIS COMPRESSED-AIR
CONCEPT COULD BE A HERO.
BUT FOR ME, YOU WOULD
HAVE TO HAVE HAD THE RIGHTS
TO ALL OF THE U.S.A.
FOR ME TO REALLY BE INTERESTED.
I'M OUT.
YOUR DEAL DOESN'T MAKE A LOT
OF SENSE FOR A SHARK AT ALL,
BECAUSE THE RETURN EXPECTATIONS
ON THIS ARE FAR IN THE FUTURE.
IT'S A MONUMENTAL TASK.
NOBODY WANTS TO LAUNCH THIS
IN HAWAII.
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GONNA DO IT.
I THINK I'VE ARTICULATED WHY.
YEAH.
YOU MAY HAVE A SHARK
WHO'S SO INGRAINED
IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY.
HE MAY BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO IT.
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT RIGHT NOW.
BUT I'M OUT.
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
HIS NAME IS KEVIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
O'Leary: I LIKE IT.
WOW.
I WANT TO BE THE DOCTOR.
SO, WE STARTED THIS PROCESS,
MADE THESE BARS,
GOT THEM INTO THE MARKETPLACE --
MOSTLY IN COLORADO,
IN WHOLE FOODS.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT KEVIN --
AND THE TYPE OF OFFERS HE MAKES,
RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
SO I'M GONNA PUT YOU
ON THE SPOT.
OKAY.
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MY OFFER. HOW
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?
COME ON.
IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO KEVIN,
THAT'S FINE. I'M OUT.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN
TO KEVIN AND TAKE MY OFFER --
'CAUSE YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH THE
KIND OF OFFER HE'S GONNA MAKE.
THAT'S INTERESTING, 'CAUSE
MY OFFER MAY BE MUCH BETTER.
WHO'S THE NUMBER-ONE
TACKLE MANUFACTURER?
LET SOMEBODY ELSE
DO EVERYTHING ELSE
AND GET A PAYCHECK
EVERY MONTH.
SHELL BOBBER
IS INTERESTING...
YOU GOT TO MAKE UP
YOUR MIND.
...BUT IT'S
A SMALL COMPANY.
MAKE HIM AN OFFER.
IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN
YOUR PRODUCT...
THIS IS
THE MR. WONDERFUL TRAP.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT THE OFFER IS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT,
OR YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?
YOU GOT TO DECIDE.
YOUR MONEY'S ON THE TABLE.
YOU MAY GO TO SLEEP
AND ALWAYS WONDER.
NO, I'M JUST SAYING.
AND DOES KEVIN LIKE FISHING
WHEN YOU TAKE HIM?
[ LAUGHTER ]
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
ARE ACCESSORIES
TO HELP CHANGE UP YOUR LOOK
IN A SNAP.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS KONRAD BILLETZ.
AND I'M KEVIN HABICH.
AND TODAY,
WE'RE SEEKING $150,000
FOR 3.5% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY, FRAMERI.
WHY IS IT THAT I HAVE A CLOSET
FILLED WITH 20 PAIRS OF SHOES,
10 SUITS, 15 PAIRS OF PANTS,
AND 15 SHIRTS,
BUT I ONLY OWN
ONE PAIR OF GLASSES?
SO THAT'S WHY WE CREATED
FRAMERI.
WITH FRAMERI, NOW YOU CAN
CHANGE YOUR GLASSES
AS EASY AS YOU CHANGE
THE REST OF YOUR OUTFITS.
BUY THE PRESCRIPTION LENSES
THAT YOU NEED
AND SNAP THEM INTO THE FRAMES
THAT YOU WANT.
SO, LET'S SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.
WHILE THESE ALL MIGHT LOOK LIKE
NORMAL PAIRS OF GLASSES,
THEY AREN'T.
WE'VE DESIGNED OUR FRAMES
AND OUR LENSES
SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY
SNAP THE LENSES IN AND OUT.
THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE
TO USE THE SAME LENS
AND MOVE THAT LENS IN BETWEEN
MULTIPLE QUALITY FRAMES.
AND PUTTING YOU LENSES IN
IS A SNAP.
AND WE ALSO OFFER
SUN LENSES,
SO ALL OF YOUR
AWESOME FRAMERI GLASSES
CAN BECOME SUNGLASSES,
AS WELL.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY,
SHARKS?
WHO WANTS TO HELP US
CHANGE HOW PEOPLE SEE?
NOW KEVIN'S GOING TO BE BRINGING
YOU SOME OF OUR PRODUCT.
NOW, THESE ARE OUR PACKAGES
THAT ACTUALLY GET SENT
TO ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS.
IN EACH OF YOUR BOXES,
YOU'RE GONNA SEE THERE'S THREE
FRAMES AND TWO SETS OF LENSES.
OH, EASY.
IT'LL SNAP RIGHT IN.
VERY GOOD.
VERY EASY.
THIS MEANS THAT YOU HAVE
SIX PAIRS OF GLASSES THERE.
THAT RETAILS FOR $500
ON OUR WEBSITE.
WE DO $100 FRAMES
AND $100 LENSES --
VERY SIMPLE PRICING.
OOH, LOOKING GOOD.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M LIKING THOSE.
BOLD CHOICE.
LET'S SEE.
THOSE LOOK GOOD.
YEAH?
John:
SO, KONRAD AND KEVIN, UNLESS
MY VISION IS A LITTLE BLURRY,
DID YOU OFFER
3.5% FOR $150,000?
WE DID.
DID YOUR MOTHER DROP YOU
ON YOUR HEAD, AS WELL?
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU CAN PROVE ME WRONG
BY TELLING ME YOUR SALES
THIS LAST YEAR.
SURE. SO, WE ARE ONLY OPEN
FOR PREORDERS RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE SOLD
$70,000 WORTH.
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME,
KONRAD?
WE OPENED UP PREORDERS
IN OCTOBER.
AND WE ACTUALLY RAN
A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN.
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE
ON CROWDFUNDING?
$64,000.
WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL?
$30,000.
YOU DOUBLED YOUR GOAL?
YEAH.
LUXOTTICA DOES 90% OF THE FRAMES
ON EARTH,
WHICH NOBODY KNOWS
THAT BRAND.
IT'S RE-BRANDED
BY EVERYBODY ELSE.
WHY COULDN'T
THEY CRUSH YOU
LIKE THE EYEGLASS COCKROACHES
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?
Billetz: WE ALLOW YOU TO
ACTUALLY CUSTOMIZE YOUR GLASSES
ON THE WEBSITE,
SO YOU CAN SEE
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE
BEFORE THEY GET SHIPPED TO YOU.
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE --
CAN YOU SEE THEM
ON YOUR FACE?
Habich: YEAH.
OH, YOU CAN. OKAY.
YEAH, AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE
AN AUGMENTED-REALITY PLUG-IN
THAT WE USE, SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY
TRY THE LENSES ON YOUR FACE.
Herjavec:
OH, THAT'S COOL.
WE ALSO OFFER
FREE SHIPPING AND RETURNS.
SO, THEN, WITH ALL THIS CUSTOM
AND PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING,
WALK US THROUGH THE COSTS.
WALK US THROUGH
WHAT YOU SELL THEM FOR.
SO, OUR FRAMES COST US
ABOUT $27,
AND OUR LENSES COST US
RIGHT AROUND $10.
John:
I WANT TO GET TO SOMETHING,
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD
THE ANSWER.
AGAIN, YOU'RE ASKING FOR
A VALUATION OF OVER $4 MILLION.
YOU HAVE ONLY PREORDERED
$70,000 WORTH OF PRODUCT.
WHY ARE YOU VALUING
AT THAT COST?
ARE YOU HERE TO GET EXPOSURE
OR GET EXPOSED?
WHICH ONE?
YOU'RE ASKING FOR
A VALUATION OF OVER $4 MILLION.
WHY ARE YOU VALUING
AT THAT COST?
ARE YOU HERE TO GET EXPOSURE
OR GET EXPOSED?
WHICH ONE?
WE CAME HERE
TO MAKE A DEAL.
YOU CAME HERE TO MAKE A DEAL,
BUT 3.5% --
WE WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.
WELL, LET'S TALK.
I MEAN, WE'RE VERY, VERY HAPPY
TO TALK. WE CAME HERE --
LET ME TRY TO --
WAIT, BUT WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
'CAUSE YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND
ONE THING.
AND MAYBE THE OTHER GUYS FEEL
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
THAT FLOOR RIGHT THERE IS FOR
PEOPLE THAT DESPERATELY NEED
A SHOT AND ACCESS
TO CAPITAL.
THEY'RE NOT SOMEBODY
THAT RAISED A MILLION DOLLARS,
DIDN'T EVEN
LAUNCH SOMETHING.
LET ME ASK
SOME QUESTIONS NOW.
I WANT TO HEAR THIS!
LET THEM ANSWER IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IMPRESSION.
I'M FROM
A SMALL TOWN IN IDAHO.
I'VE TRIED TO LAUNCH
OTHER COMPANIES
AND LIVED IN MY CAR.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I'VE BEEN THERE.
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH
YOU VALUING THE COMPANY
OVER $4 MILLION?
LET ME ASK
SOME QUESTIONS.
WELL, MARK,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU,
BUT IT BOTHERS ME, TOO.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND --
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY SOLD
OR HAD EXPERIENCE
WITH THIS PRODUCT WHATSOEVER.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR RETURN RATE'S GONNA BE.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
THE QUALITY IS GONNA HOLD UP.
YOU DON'T KNOW
A LOT OF THINGS.
AND YOU DO COME IN HERE
VALUING IT
AT A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT,
FOR HAVING NO EXPERIENCE.
I HATE WHEN I HEAR THIS
FROM THE OTHER SHARKS.
I JUST HATE IT,
HATE IT, HATE IT.
THIS IS NOT ONLY
FOR THE DESPERATE.
IF SOMEONE HAS A GOOD IDEA AND
COME IN HERE AND SELL US ON IT
THEY CAN GET
AN INVESTOR...
NO, BUT, MARK, WE DON'T
HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU.
...JUST LIKE THEY WENT
TO OTHER INVESTORS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING, AND
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU.
I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOU.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU COME IN ASKING FOR THAT
WHEN YOU HAVE
JUST NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT YET.
WE DON'T HAVE
SOMEBODY ON OUR TEAM
AS AN INVESTOR
THAT CAN BUILD A BRAND.
THAT'S TRUE.
WE NEED TO BECOME A BRAND.
WE WANT TO GO INTERNATIONAL.
I DON'T SEE
PROOF OF CONCEPT.
WHAT IS YOUR
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST
KEVIN -- KEVIN, IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU'RE A SILENT PARTNER?
YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING.
Habich: NO.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M JUST NOT
THE FINANCIAL GUY.
OKAY.
AND IT'S ALL
VALUATION QUESTIONS.
I GET IT.
LET ME JUST JUMP IN
FOR A MINUTE.
I THINK THE GLASSES LOOK GREAT
AND THE QUALITY'S NICE.
THE PROBLEM, FOR ME, IS
WHEN YOU HAVE A PRODUCT,
TRY IT, TEST IT, SEE,
BEFORE YOU START RAISING
ALL SORTS OF MONEY.
SO FOR ME, I DON'T THINK I HAVE
THE SAME PHILOSOPHY AS YOU,
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU.
KONRAD, I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH BIG BETS.
I MEAN,
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESIGN.
IT LOOKS GREAT.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S WORTH
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
YOU'RE SELLING IT FOR.
MY ONLY ISSUE IS I WISH YOU HAD
A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCE.
I'M NOT FAULTING YOU
FOR IT,
'CAUSE YOU GOT TO START
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?
YOU'RE ONLY
A FIRST-TIME C.E.O. ONCE.
RIGHT.
AND IT'S JUST
THAT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY --
NOT A NEGATIVE,
JUST THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
SO...
I'M GONNA BE OUT.
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T CARE WHERE VALUATION IS.
I CARE ABOUT
WHERE VALUATION CAN GO.
MM-HMM.
AND YOU MENTIONED TO KEVIN
THAT THERE WAS
A $25 CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COST
THAT YOU ESTIMATE.
SO, HOW ARE YOU SPENDING
THAT $25?
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE NOT.
OUR GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY'S
REALLY BASED AROUND THREE AREAS.
IT'S AROUND, YOU KNOW,
BUILDING AWARENESS --
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
BUILD AWARENESS?
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH
AN AWESOME FASHION P.R. AGENCY,
AN E-COMMERCE P.R. AGENCY, IN
NEW YORK, TO PREPARE FOR LAUNCH.
SO, BUT -- OKAY, SO, YOU'RE
GONNA GET YOUR BLAST OF P.R.
YEP.
THEN WHAT?
OUR PRODUCT --
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
AN INHERENTLY VIRAL PRODUCT.
IT'S DESIGNED TO SHARE,
RIGHT?
IF YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
BOTH HAVE TITLE FRAMES,
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
SWAP YOUR FRAMES.
IN ADDITION,
THERE'S THIS --
THAT'S A STRETCH.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT'S A NICE TRY,
BUT IT'S A STRETCH.
AND I THINK -- I THINK --
I THINK THE REAL KEY
IS THAT THERE'S --
LOOK IN THE MARKET,
ALL RIGHT?
YOU SEE EVERYBODY SELLING
THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
EXPLAINED TO ME
HOW YOU'RE GONNA CONVEY THAT
TO A POTENTIAL BUYER,
OTHER THAN SWAPPING LENSES,
IF SOMEONE ALREADY HAS IT.
SO PRODUCT, GREAT.
MM-HMM.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE DIED.
THE FACT THAT
I DON'T SEE YOU AS HAVING
A VERY SPECIFIC GO-TO-MARKET
STRATEGY BEYOND P.R.,
THAT REALLY CONCERNS ME.
IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE AMAZING PRODUCT GUYS
BUT DON'T HAVE
THAT OTHER PART FIGURED OUT.
FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
SURE.
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.
I'M VERY VALUABLE TO YOU
FOR TWO REASONS.
ONE,
I'M THE ONLY SHARK LEFT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
OKAY?
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S USUALLY
THE ONLY REASON.
AND, TWO,
YOU'RE THE ONLY SHARK LEFT.
O'Leary: SECONDLY, MY COMPANIES
GET A LOT OF MEDIA,
BECAUSE I'M A MEDIA WHORE.
IT'S WHAT I DO.
I'M VERY GOOD AT IT.
AND WHAT I THINK I CAN DO,
OR HELP YOU WITH,
IS REDUCE YOUR
CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION COSTS.
IF I CAN MAKE THEM ZERO,
YOU LAST A LOT LONGER.
YEAH, WE WOULD LAST
A VERY LONG TIME.
SO HERE'S THE DEAL
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
AS A LOAN.
HERE'S HOW
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME BACK.
EVERY TIME YOU SELL
ONE OF THESE BOX SETS,
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME $25
UNTIL I'VE RECOUPED $450,000.
THEN THE LOAN GOES AWAY.
BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER THING.
YOU'RE GIVING ME
THAT 3.5% EQUITY,
JUST BECAUSE
I'M MR. WONDERFUL.
I THINK YOU'VE DONE A HECK
OF A GOOD JOB GETTING HERE.
I LIKE THE PRODUCT.
BUT YOU ARE IN
A BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE SPACE.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
IT'S THE ONLY ONE.
NO, I DON'T WANT
A COUNTER.
THAT'S FINE.
RIGHT NOW,
I'M JUST IN THE START-UP STAGE.
ANY ROYALTIES
IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.
YOU'RE NOT IN
THE START-UP STAGE.
YOU'RE ON THE TRACK.
SURE. UM...
YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY,
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN OFFER
THAT WE CAN TAKE AT THIS TIME.
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU GUYS.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Billetz:
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
Greiner: BYE.
THANK YOU GUYS.
HAVE A GREAT DAY.
IT'S DISAPPOINTING,
I THINK, FOR BOTH OF US,
TO NOT HAVE A DEAL, BUT WE'RE
GONNA KEEP PUSHING FORWARD,
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR DREAM
AND MAKE IT A REALITY.
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST "NO"
WE'VE HEARD.
NO, IT'S NOT THE FIR--
WON'T BE THE LAST.
