HI, I'M BEATRICE.
Fraser:
THIS BACHELOR CLEARLY NEEDED
SOME HELP WITH HIS BEDROOM.
WHERE IS THAT,
A PRISON SOMEWHERE?
NO, I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD.
WHY WOULD YOU RUIN IT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, WELL JUST WAIT!
HERE'S THE "AFTER."
HE WANTED
AN URBAN-INDUSTRIAL LOOK.
WHOA!
WE TRANSFORMED IT
FOR $1,000.
WOW.
Corcoran: IMPOSSIBLE.
SO THIS NEXT CLIENT STILL HAD
HER COLLEGE FUTON.
SHE WANTED A GLAMOROUS,
SHABBY-CHIC BEDROOM
THAT WOULD MATCH
HER NEW ADULT LIFE.
WE GAVE THAT TO HER
FOR $1,700.
OH, I LIKE THAT.
OH, THAT'S NICE.
YEAH.
THE INTERIOR DESIGN WORLD
IS SHIFTING ONLINE
I MEAN, YOU SKYPE IN --
Fischel-Bock:
WE HAVE THEIR SURVEYS,
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE QUESTIONS
READY FOR THEM.
O'Leary:
JUST OUT OF INTEREST,
IF YOU HAVE
A VIDEO OR SKYPE CALL,
HOW MANY FOLLOW THROUGH
TO BECOME REAL CLIENTS?
UM, I WOULD SAY ABOUT 1 IN 8
FILL OUT OUR SURVEY
THAT FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH THE CONSULTATION.
SO WHY DON'T YOU CHARGE THEM
THAT'S THE ATTRACTION
OF THE INTERNET, YEAH.
'CAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST US YET.
THEY NEED TO
GET ON THE PHONE.
HOW MANY HOURS OF TIME
DO THEY EAT UP
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY CLOSE OUT
THAT TRANSACTION?
'CAUSE WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA HIT THE WALL
WHEN I ASKED HER --
Fraser: NO, WE WON'T.
NO, NO, BECAUSE
WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUT...
NO.
...THOSE MAN-HOURS
SO WE'RE NOT --
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE
15 MINUTES ON THE PHONE
WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A ROBOT?
NO, WE'RE GONNA DO IT
ON THE COMPUTER.
THERE'S THREE OF US.
WHY WOULD THEY NOT MISS
THAT 15-MINUTE CONSULTATION?
SO, I GET
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,
Fischel-Bock:
WE -- WE'RE FIGURING IT OUT.
WE'RE REALLY YOUNG.
YEAH, IF --
WE JUST GRADUATED
THREE WEEKS AGO.
SO WE'VE JUST --
IT'S BEEN A PROCESS.
WE WANT TO LEARN FROM YOU.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MENTOR.
Cuban: FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE NOT THAT YOUNG, RIGHT?
THE -- THE "WE'RE REALLY YOUNG"
EXCUSE -- EH, DON'T WORK.
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO DO YOUR THING, RIGHT?
OF COURSE, YES.
THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.
YOU GOT TO PRODUCE, RIGHT?
Fraser: GREAT.
Corcoran: I ALSO LOVE
YOUR $1,000 MINIMUM.
I'D HATE TO SEE THAT CHANGE
BECAUSE -- ONLY 1,000 BUCKS.
EVERYBODY REMEMBERS IT.
Fraser: WHOO!
[ CHUCKLES ]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Fischel-Bock: WOMEN
IN BUSINESS -- WE LIKE THAT.
GREAT DRESSES.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK. CONGRATS.
Fraser: WHOO-HOO!
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS CRAZY.
YOU WILL NEVER MAKE
ANY MONEY ON THAT.
I WILL MAKE MONEY.
YES, SHE WILL.
YES, SHE WILL.
I WILL MAKE MONEY.
WE NEEDED A MENTOR.
THAT WAS OUR NUMBER-ONE THING
COMING INTO THE GATE,
