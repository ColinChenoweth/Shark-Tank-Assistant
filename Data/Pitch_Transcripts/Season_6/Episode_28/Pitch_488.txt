I'M LIZZIE.
I'M MADELINE.
AND I'M BEATRICE.
AND OUR BUSINESS
IS CALLED ZOOM.
THE THREE OF US MET
IN COLLEGE,
ACTUALLY,
IN OUR FIRST DESIGN CLASS,
AND IT WAS KIND OF
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,
AND WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER EVER SINCE.
AT SCHOOL, WE CAME UP
WITH AN AWESOME BUSINESS IDEA
BASED ON HIGH STYLE
AND IMPECCABLE DESIGN.
PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE
TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY
TO GET A GOOD DESIGN,
BUT THAT'S
SO NOT THE CASE.
WE FIGURED OUT A NEW WAY
TO BRING STYLE TO EVERYONE
AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE
AND ACCESSIBLE.
WE GRADUATED A FEW WEEKS AGO
AND MOVED TO PHILLY
AND HAVE OFFICIALLY STARTED
OUR BUSINESS.
EACH OF US TAKES ON
A DIFFERENT ROLE IN THE COMPANY.
I'M IN CHARGE
OF MARKETING AND SALES,
AND I'M ALSO
OUR IN-HOUSE ARTIST.
I'M THE
CREATIVE DIRECTOR.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
OF THIS COLOR COMBO?
AND I TAKE ON
GENERAL OPERATIONS.
WE ARE ON BUDGET,
SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO!
WE HAVE WORKED SO HARD
TO GROW THIS COMPANY
OVER THE PAST YEAR,
AND IT MEANS THE WORLD TO US.
WE HAVE BIG DREAMS,
AND WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING
TOGETHER FOREVER.
WE KNOW
WITH A SHARK ON OUR TEAM,
WE CAN ZOOM PAST
OUR COMPETITION
AND TAKE THIS COMPANY
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
GUESS WHAT, SHARKS.
All:
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET ZOOMED!
HI, I'M BEATRICE.
I'M MADELINE.
AND I'M LIZZIE.
All:
AND WE ARE THE ZOOM TEAM.
OUR COMPANY
IS ZOOM INTERIORS
AND WE'RE ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR 20% OF OUR COMPANY.
ZOOM INTERIORS IS
AN ONLINE SERVICE
THAT IS GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE
THE INTERIOR-DESIGN WORLD
BY MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE
AND AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE.
WE BELIEVE
THAT EVERYONE DESERVES
TO BE GRACED
WITH A STYLISH LIVING SPACE
TO ENHANCE THEIR LIVES
AND IT IS OUR MISSION
TO DO JUST THAT.
LET US WALK YOU
THROUGH OUR ZOOM DESIGN PROCESS
FROM START TO FINISH
WITH A RECENT PROJECT.
STEP ONE -- FILL OUT
THE "GET ZOOMED" SURVEY
TO START
THE DESIGN PROCESS.
IT'S QUICK AND PAINLESS.
STEP TWO -- SCHEDULE YOUR FREE
15-MINUTE ZOOM CONSULTATION
OVER THE PHONE OR VIDEO CHAT.
STEP THREE --
RECEIVE YOUR MOOD BOARD,
A.K.A., ZOOM BOARD,
TO BETTER VISUALIZE OUR DESIGN.
STEP FOUR -- WORK WITH
YOUR PERSONAL DESIGNERS
TO PERFECT THE DESIGN
OF YOUR SPACE.
STEP FIVE -- GET YOUR ZOOM CART,
OR FINAL INVENTORY.
STEP SIX -- RECEIVE YOUR
EASY-TO-READ FLOOR PLANS
FOR A SELF-INSTALLATION.
THIS IS THE "BEFORE" PHOTO
FROM THIS PROJECT.
OUR CLIENTS WANTED
A FULL TRANSFORMATION
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS SPACE
BRIGHT, MODERN, AND COLORFUL.
AND LOOK AT THAT --
QUITE A DIFFERENCE.
WOW.
Herjavec: WOW.
HERE ARE
SOME OTHER ZOOM PROJECTS
WITH DIFFERENT BUDGETS
AND STYLES.
Fraser:
THIS BACHELOR CLEARLY NEEDED
SOME HELP WITH HIS BEDROOM.
WHERE IS THAT,
A PRISON SOMEWHERE?
NO, I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD.
WHY WOULD YOU RUIN IT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, WELL JUST WAIT!
HERE'S THE "AFTER."
HE WANTED
AN URBAN-INDUSTRIAL LOOK.
WHOA!
WE TRANSFORMED IT
FOR $1,000.
WOW.
Corcoran: IMPOSSIBLE.
SO THIS NEXT CLIENT STILL HAD
HER COLLEGE FUTON.
SHE WANTED A GLAMOROUS,
SHABBY-CHIC BEDROOM
THAT WOULD MATCH
HER NEW ADULT LIFE.
WE GAVE THAT TO HER
FOR $1,700.
OH, I LIKE THAT.
OH, THAT'S NICE.
YEAH.
THE INTERIOR DESIGN WORLD
IS SHIFTING ONLINE
AND WE PLAN TO BE AT
THE FOREFRONT OF THIS MOVEMENT.
WITH YOUR HELP, WE CAN TAKE THIS
COMPANY TO THE NEXT LEVEL...
All: AT ZOOM SPEED!
O'Leary: TELL US
HOW YOU MAKE MONEY, LADIES.
SO WE HAVE SO FAR BEEN
IN BUSINESS 14 MONTHS.
WE STARTED IN COLLEGE
OUR JUNIOR YEAR,
AND WE'RE TESTING
THE WATERS.
TURNS OUT IT DOES WORK,
AND WE'VE GROSSED $186,000.
Corcoran: HOW MUCH OF THAT
DID YOU NET?
DID YOU ACTUALLY GET
ANY MONEY IN YOUR POCKET?
SO -- WE NET $3,000
AT THE END OF THAT YEAR.
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?
DO YOU MAKE MONEY ON THE FEES?
DO YOU MAKE MONEY
ON SELLING THE FURNITURE?
WE'VE STARTED WITH A SERVICE FEE
OF 18% COMMISSION
ON THE COST OF GOODS PURCHASED
FOR OUR CLIENT.
SO I SIGN UP WITH YOU.
WHAT'S MY FEE JUST TO SIGN UP?
SO TO START, $150 AFTER YOU HAVE
OUR FREE ZOOM CONSULTATION.
YOU MEAN YOU TALK TO THEM
BEFORE YOU GET THE $150?
YES.
YES.
YES, WE DO.
WHY DON'T CHARGE THAT
FOR THE VIDEO CHAT?
IT'S 15 MINUTES -- SOMETIMES IT
TAKES LESS THAN THAT --
AND IT MAKES THE CLIENT FEEL
LIKE WE'RE AN ACTUAL PERSON.
Cuban: WELL,
WHAT CAN YOU DO IN 15 MINUTES?
I MEAN, YOU SKYPE IN --
Fischel-Bock:
WE HAVE THEIR SURVEYS,
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE QUESTIONS
READY FOR THEM.
O'Leary:
JUST OUT OF INTEREST,
IF YOU HAVE
A VIDEO OR SKYPE CALL,
HOW MANY FOLLOW THROUGH
TO BECOME REAL CLIENTS?
UM, I WOULD SAY ABOUT 1 IN 8
FILL OUT OUR SURVEY
THAT FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH THE CONSULTATION.
SO WHY DON'T YOU CHARGE THEM
THAT'S THE ATTRACTION
OF THE INTERNET, YEAH.
'CAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST US YET.
THEY NEED TO
GET ON THE PHONE.
HOW MANY HOURS OF TIME
DO THEY EAT UP
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY CLOSE OUT
THAT TRANSACTION?
'CAUSE WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA HIT THE WALL
ON THIS DEAL RIGHT AWAY IS,
IF THIS WORKS AND IT SCALES,
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA CLONE YOURSELVES.
LIKE, HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
WE WANT TO PROGRAM THIS PROCESS
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE OUT
THE MAN-HOURS
THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN RIGHT NOW.
Herjavec: ARE YOU CHANGING
THE BUSINESS MODEL
AWAY FROM MAKING 18%
ON THE FURNITURE?
YES, YES, WE ARE.
RIGHT NOW WE MAKE 18%.
WHEN WE START WORKING
WITH THESE MANUFACTURERS,
WE'LL BE MAKING 55%.
YEAH, BUT THEN YOU
HAVE TO TAKE INVENTORY.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME GET THIS ONE THING OUT,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT --
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.
HANG ON. HANG ON. YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW THE PROBLEM YET.
HOW DO YOU SCALE IT?
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
IF THEY MAKE 18% OR 20%?
ONE AT A TIME!
AAH!
EXCUSE ME.
IT'S IRRELEVANT.
STOP!
SHE'S A LADY.
LET HER SPEAK.
BE QUIET.
THANK YOU.
IT DOESN'T MATTER!
WAIT, JUST CALM.
IT'LL NEVER WORK.
SO RUDE.
I'M NOT RUDE.
OH, MY GOD.
WELCOME TO "SHARK TANK."
[ LAUGHTER ]
STOP!
WHO CARES?
Herjavec: WELL,
THEY'RE GOING TO 55%.
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS IS IMPORTANT, THOUGH.
NO, IT ISN'T.
[ SIGHS ]
WHERE I THINK
YOU'RE SAYING YOU MAKE MONEY --
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I UNDERSTAND THIS --
IS YOU'RE GONNA WORK DIRECT
TO MANUFACTURERS
AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
A WHOLESALER, ESSENTIALLY.
YEAH.
IF A CHAIR COSTS 10 BUCKS...
WE'LL MAKE THAT 50%.
...YOU'RE GONNA BUY IT FOR
10 BUCKS FROM THE MANUFACTURER
AND YOU'RE GONNA TURN AROUND
AND SELL IT FOR 20 OR 25
OR WHATEVER IT IS.
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
YES.
SO THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE PLANNING TO MAKE MONEY.
AND THAT'S JUST STARTED
RIGHT NOW.
AND THAT'S WHY IT MATTERS.
NO, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
GET BACK TO WHAT DOES MATTER.
OKAY.
HOW DO YOU SCALE IT?
CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION?
ARE YOU GONNA TALK
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON --
IF YOU WERE LISTENING
WHEN I ASKED HER --
Fraser: NO, WE WON'T.
NO, NO, BECAUSE
WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUT...
NO.
...THOSE MAN-HOURS
SO WE'RE NOT --
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE
15 MINUTES ON THE PHONE
WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A ROBOT?
NO, WE'RE GONNA DO IT
ON THE COMPUTER.
THERE'S THREE OF US.
WHY WOULD THEY NOT MISS
THAT 15-MINUTE CONSULTATION?
SO, I GET
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,
AND THAT'S
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO SCALE.
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE --
YOUR SCALABILITY IS DEPENDENT
ON YOU CREATING
A SOFTWARE APPLICATION
THAT YOU THINK MIGHT HAPPEN
IN...SIX MONTHS,
WHEN YOU'D BE LUCKY
TO DO IT IN SIX YEARS?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING.
OH.
THAT'S NOT EASY.
$100,000 WON'T EVEN
GET YOU IN THE DOOR.
$200,000, $1 MILLION --
IT'S PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE.
WELL, WE'VE GOTTEN ESTIMATES
FOR $100,000.
I'M WORKING WITH A COMPANY --
YEAH, TRUST ME.
[ IMITATES BUZZER ]
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
I'M OUT.
SO AFTER I DO THE $150,
IS THERE A MINIMUM FURNITURE BUY
THAT I HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?
IT'S $1,000.
SO OUT OF THE PEOPLE
THAT GIVE YOU $150,
HOW MANY GO
TO THE FURNITURE BUY?
I WOULD SAY 90%.
YEAH.
Herjavec:
OKAY, OUT OF THE PEOPLE
THAT ACTUALLY BUY THE FURNITURE,
WHAT IS THE AVERAGE
PURCHASE PRICE OF FURNITURE?
ABOUT $2,500,
EXACTLY.
OKAY, SO I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM
WITH THE 15 MINUTES
THAT YOU'RE SPENDING
ON THE PHONE.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY.
O'Leary: I DO.
YOU SPEND 15 MINUTES
NOT MAKING MONEY.
OKAY, BUT LADIES,
YOU'RE SPENDING
15 MINUTES ON THE PHONE.
YOU CAN TEACH SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT YOU CAN SUPERVISE.
OF COURSE. YES.
IN 15 MINUTES,
IN AN HOUR BLOCK, THAT'S 4X.
YEAH.
THAT PERSON GENERATES $600.
OF WHICH NONE OF THEM
BUY ANYTHING!
THAT'S GENERATING $600 AN HOUR,
ALMOST 5 GRAND A DAY.
Fischel-Bock: AND WE CAN HIRE
SOMEONE FREELANCE
TO COVER THAT HOUR.
AND IF 90% ARE GOING
TO A FURNITURE BUY --
ROBERT, YOU MADE
A HUGE MISTAKE THERE.
WHY?
THEY DO THE CALL FOR
FREE, WHICH I FORBID
THEM TO EVER DO AGAIN.
EITHER WAY, YOU WANT THE MONEY
TO AUTOMATE THE PROCESS
TO GET RID OF
THE 15-MINUTE CALL, AM I RIGHT?
WE -- WE'RE FIGURING IT OUT.
WE'RE REALLY YOUNG.
YEAH, IF --
WE JUST GRADUATED
THREE WEEKS AGO.
SO WE'VE JUST --
IT'S BEEN A PROCESS.
WE WANT TO LEARN FROM YOU.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MENTOR.
Cuban: FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE NOT THAT YOUNG, RIGHT?
THE -- THE "WE'RE REALLY YOUNG"
EXCUSE -- EH, DON'T WORK.
Fischel-Bock:
WE -- WE'RE FIGURING IT OUT.
WE'RE REALLY YOUNG.
YEAH, IF --
WE JUST GRADUATED
THREE WEEKS AGO.
SO WE'VE JUST --
IT'S BEEN A PROCESS.
WE WANT TO LEARN FROM YOU.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MENTOR.
Cuban: FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE NOT THAT YOUNG, RIGHT?
THE -- THE "WE'RE REALLY YOUNG"
EXCUSE -- EH, DON'T WORK.
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO DO YOUR THING, RIGHT?
OF COURSE, YES.
THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.
YOU GOT TO PRODUCE, RIGHT?
YEAH, AND WE'VE BEEN LEARNING.
WE'VE BEEN GROWING.
Corcoran: I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT THE THREE OF YOU.
WHO DOES WHAT?
ARE YOU ALL FULL-TIME?
YES.
SO, WE ARE FULL-TIME.
WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
SUPPORT YOURSELVES?
WE WOULD TAKE
PART-TIME JOBS.
WE HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY.
WE CAN DO IT.
NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA.
JUST GO FOR IT, RIGHT? GRIND.
WE ARE GOING FOR IT.
YOU GUYS CAN -- THE THREE OF YOU
CAN LIVE TOGETHER.
GO GET SEVEN OTHER ROOMMATES
TO LIVE WITH YOU.
I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR
FOR SIX MONTHS.
SIX GUYS
IN A THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENT.
I HAD ONE TOWEL THAT STOOD UP
IN THE CORNER BY ITSELF, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WAS NASTY.
IT DIDN'T MATTER.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT
OF THOSE APARTMENTS.
YEAH.
RIGHT, 'CAUSE EVERY MINUTE
YOU SPEND BARTENDING IS
A MINUTE YOU'RE NOT SELLING,
YOU'RE NOT DOING A CONSULTATION,
YOU'RE NOT
GETTING A CLIENT.
Herjavec:
I LIKE THE IDEA,
BUT YOU CAME IN SAYING
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE MONEY
AND YOU'RE GONNA SPEND IT
ON APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT.
DON'T -- THE WORST MISTAKE
YOU COULD EVER MAKE.
WELL, IF YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE RIGHT IDEA --
ARE YOU GONNA SPEND IT ON THAT?
IS THAT
WHAT YOUR PLAN IS?
THAT'S OUR PLAN,
BUT WE'RE -- I MEAN, IF --
DON'T.
DON'T.
IF YOU DON'T THINK
THAT WE SHOULD, THEN --
NO, I -- HOLD ON.
I FORBID YOU.
IF YOU WERE US, WHAT WOULD
YOU USE THE MONEY FOR?
IF I WERE YOU GUYS,
I'D GRIND, RIGHT?
RIGHT, YES.
JUST EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
RIGHT NOW AND KEEP ON GROWING.
I WOULDN'T GET
ANOTHER JOB.
I'D SLEEP ON THE FLOOR.
I'D LIVE LIKE A STUDENT.
I WOULD MAKE SURE I DON'T HAVE
ANY DEBT WHATSOEVER --
NO CREDIT CARD, NO NOTHING,
SO THERE'S NO OTHER OBLIGATIONS,
AND I WOULD HUSTLE.
AND THEN YOU JUST GROW.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUSH.
MADELINE, I HATE THE ANSWER
YOU GAVE ON THE PROGRAMMING.
"OKAY, WE WON'T DO IT.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
WE SHOULD DO?"
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO
HELP YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEAS.
I CAN HELP YOU INVEST
AND GROW IT.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
O'Leary:
LOOK, I-I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
I HAD WHEN YOU WALKED IN.
I DON'T SEE IT BEING SCALABLE.
I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
YOU HAVE DEAL IN REALITY.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I LOVE THE IDEA,
BUT HEARING EVERYTHING
THAT WE'VE HEARD HERE,
I FEEL LIKE IT'S GONNA BE
A REALLY LONG, HARD ROAD.
AND, TO MARK'S POINT,
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LOT MORE MONEY.
I THINK THERE'S
SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT.
AND I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.
IT'S OKAY. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
BARBARA?
[ CHUCKLES ]
I COULD GO EITHER WAY
ON THIS, QUITE HONESTLY.
OKAY.
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT
IS YOUR LOW $150 FEE.
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT
NOT CHANGE.
I THINK THAT'S
RIGHT ON THE DIME.
Fraser: GREAT.
Corcoran: I ALSO LOVE
YOUR $1,000 MINIMUM.
I'D HATE TO SEE THAT CHANGE
BECAUSE -- ONLY 1,000 BUCKS.
EVERYBODY REMEMBERS IT.
AND I LOVE
YOUR ENERGY AND HUSTLE.
THE BAD NEWS --
I DON'T LIKE THE APPLICATION
DEVELOPMENT PART OF IT AT ALL.
TO MARK'S POINT,
IT COSTS YOU SO MUCH MONEY,
AND YOU'LL BE CONSTANTLY BE
NEEDING TO DO IT.
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE ROAD TO RICHES,
SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT
OUT OF THE DEAL.
GOOD.
THAT'S FINE WITH US.
GREAT, OKAY, SO
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
OH, WOW.
OOH.
OKAY.
NOW HERE'S
THE BAD NEWS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S NOT BAD NEWS, NO.
I NEED 1/3 OF THE BUSINESS
FOR THE MONEY YOU'RE ASKING.
I WANT TO BE
A 1/3 PARTNER.
$100,000
FOR 33% OF YOUR BUSINESS.
OKAY. SO I GUESS --
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU GOT TO JUMP
ALL OVER THAT.
I REALLY LIKE YOU,
BARBARA.
I LIKE YOU, TOO, BABY.
I LOVE YOUR --
I LOVE YOUR ENERGY.
AND I-I --
I REALLY LIKE THAT.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
I THINK SO, YES.
OKAY, YES.
YEAH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
Fraser: WHOO!
[ CHUCKLES ]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Fischel-Bock: WOMEN
IN BUSINESS -- WE LIKE THAT.
GREAT DRESSES.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK. CONGRATS.
Fraser: WHOO-HOO!
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS CRAZY.
YOU WILL NEVER MAKE
ANY MONEY ON THAT.
I WILL MAKE MONEY.
YES, SHE WILL.
YES, SHE WILL.
I WILL MAKE MONEY.
WE NEEDED A MENTOR.
THAT WAS OUR NUMBER-ONE THING
COMING INTO THE GATE,
AND WE'RE SO HAPPY THAT SHE,
YOU KNOW,
WANTS TO MENTOR US
AND WORK WITH US IN THE FUTURE.
AND THE AMOUNT THAT WE'VE GROWN
IN A YEAR ORGANICALLY,
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN
DO WITH BARBARA ON OUR TEAM.
YEAH.
IT'S EXCITING.
Narrator:
EARLIER THIS SEASON,
MOTHER-AND-SON TEAM JUDY
AND BOBBY EDWARDS MADE A DEAL
WITH LORI GREINER
FOR THEIR TOILET STOOL,
SQUATTY POTTY.
WE'RE GONNA
TAKE LORI'S OFFER.
LET'S SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
Greiner: I INVITED BOBBY
AND JUDY TO COME WITH ME
TO BED BATH &amp; BEYOND
AND CHECK OUT OUR NEW DISPLAY.
OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK AT THAT.
WE JUST LAUNCHED
IN EVERY LOCATION NATIONWIDE.
THAT'S OVER 1,100 STORES.
IT'S A TOWER
OF SQUATTY.
Judy:
THE NIGHT WE AIRED,
158,000 PEOPLE VISITED
OUR WEBSITE.
WITHIN TWO DAYS, WE SOLD
$1 MILLION IN SQUATTY POTTIES.
IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS
SINCE WE AIRED,
AND OUR TOTAL SALES
ARE $12.3 MILLION.
THIS'LL STOP YOU
AS YOU WALK IN THE STORE.
Greiner: ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
WHEN YOU GET INTO A RETAIL STORE
IS WHERE ARE YOU PLACED.
YOU COULD BE
ON THE BOTTOM SHELF.
WE HAVE AN ENTIRE
FLOOR-TO-CEILING DISPLAY.
PEOPLE WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO GET THAT.
LONG WAY FROM OUR GARAGE.
THANK YOU.
Bobby: IN THE BEGINNING,
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY
FOR SELLING SUCH A PRODUCT.
HAVING LORI ON OUR TEAM HAS
REALLY VALIDATED SQUATTY POTTY.
Greiner:
LET'S GO CELEBRATE.
Judy: LET'S DO.
Bobby: LET'S GO.
SO, IS THIS WHAT'S GOING TO BE
OUR NEW HOMEPAGE?
THIS IS IT.
I LOVE THE CHANGES.
Bobby: WE'VE MADE IT OUR MISSION
TO CHANGE THE WAY
AMERICA USES THE BATHROOM,
AND WE'RE HERE TO PROVIDE
PRODUCTS TO HELP THEM DO THAT.
AND WE'RE NOT
GONNA QUIT
TILL SQUATTY POTTY
IS A HOUSEHOLD NAME.
CHEERS!
THIS HAS BEEN SUCH
AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE FOR US.
WE CONTINUE TO BE GRATEFUL
EVERY DAY
FOR LORI AND "SHARK TANK."
All: IT'S POTTY TIME!
Narrator: NEXT UP
IS A CONVENIENT WAY
TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE PROTECTED FROM THE SUN.
