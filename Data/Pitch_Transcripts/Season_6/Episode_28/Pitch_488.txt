HELLO.
MY NAME IS TONY FAYNE.
WE ABSOLUTELY DO.
GO AHEAD, TONY.
SURE.
YEAH, WE HAVE THEM
IN NEW YORK,
IN NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA.
Herjavec: BUT, JOSH,
WALK US THOUGH IT.
WHO PAID FOR THE MACHINE
TO GET THERE?
THEY EITHER -- EXACTLY.
DOES THE HOTEL BUY
THE MACHINE FROM YOU?
THERE'S
TWO DIFFERENT MODELS
THAT WE GO THROUGH
FOR OUR SALES,
SO WE HAVE
EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS
THAT ACTUALLY
MAKE A COMMITMENT
TO BUY A CERTAIN NUMBER
OF MACHINES.
Kaplan:
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN TALKS
WITH ONE OF
THE LARGEST COMPANIES
THAT DOES THAT WITH HOTEL CHAINS
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD.
OKAY.
WE WELCOMED THEM IN
WITH OPEN ARMS.
BUT IF IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT'S JUST SOMEBODY
THAT GRINDS LIKE MYSELF --
I'VE BEEN GRINDING SINCE
I WAS 14 YEARS OLD --
Fayne: RIGHT.
THERE IS NO MARKET AT ALL
THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW
FOR RETAIL.
WE'VE JUST BEEN OPERATING
THIS BUSINESS FOR 3 1/2 MONTHS.
THE REASON
WHY WE NEED TO PARTNER --
YOU HAD IT FOR TWO YEARS
ON PROOF OF CONCEPT.
THAT WAS NOT FULL TIME.
THAT WAS BEFORE WE KNEW
WE WANTED TO COMMIT
OUR CAREERS TO IT.
SO --
[ LAUGHS, SHUDDERS ]
SO YOU GUYS PUT IT ON --
WE PROVED THE CONCEPT --
I GOT TO ROLL UP
MY PANT LEGS.
Kaplan:
THE TANK IS REALLY HARD.
I'VE BEEN IN
A LOT OF ATMOSPHERES,
DONE A LOT OF PITCHES.
