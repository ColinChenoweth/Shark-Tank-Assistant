[ LAUGHTER ]
MY NAME IS
DR. CHRISTOPHER SAKEZLES.
I AM THE FOUNDER
AND C.E.O. OF SynDaver LABS,
AND I'M SEEKING $3 MILLION
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
SynDaver LABS DESIGNS AND BUILDS
THE WORLD'S MOST SOPHISTICATED
SYNTHETIC HUMAN TISSUES
AND BODY PARTS.
MADE FROM SALT, WATER,
AND FIBER, JUST LIKE YOU AND I,
OUR PRODUCTS EMPLOY MATERIALS
THAT MIMIC THE PROPERTIES
OF HUMAN TISSUE.
THESE PRODUCTS ARE USED
THROUGHOUT THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY
TO REPLACE LIVE ANIMALS,
HUMAN CADAVERS,
AND EVEN HUMAN PATIENTS
IN TRAUMA TRAINING,
SURGICAL EDUCATION,
AND MEDICAL-DEVICE DEVELOPMENT.
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT
IS WHAT YOU SEE HERE.
IT'S THE SynDaver
SYNTHETIC HUMAN.
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN
DO PRACTICALLY ANY SURGERY ON.
SO, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS
GET A FEW VOLUNTEERS
TO COME DOWN
AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO SEE IT.
I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT IT.
ALL RIGHT,
I'M DYING TO SEE IT, TOO.
SO, YOU CAN FEEL
THAT IT'S MOIST.
THIS IS ABOUT 85% WATER
BY MASS.
IT HAS EVERY MUSCLE,
BONE, AND ORGAN
IN NATURAL HUMAN ANATOMY.
Greiner: IT ALMOST FEELS
LIKE CHICKEN -- RAW CHICKEN.
Sakezles: IT FEELS EXACTLY
LIKE LIVE TISSUE.
WE'VE SPENT
ABOUT 20 YEARS DOING
THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE TISSUES ITSELF.
AND HOW DO YOU DO SURGERY ON IT?
CAN YOU CUT IT?
YOU CAN CUT IT.
IT'S BASICALLY
A BIG 3-D JIGSAW PUZZLE.
OOH, WOW.
IT'S A BRAND-NEW SYSTEM.
IT'S A CADAVER-LIKE
ALTERNATIVE.
YES, SIR.
Herjavec: WHAT'S THE PRICE POINT
COMPARED TO A CADAVER?
IT COSTS A LOT MORE.
THIS DOES?
'CAUSE THIS IS REUSABLE.
A CADAVER'S NOT.
HOW MUCH IS THIS?
A CADAVER WILL COST YOU
5 GRAND,
10 GRAND DEPENDING
ON WHERE YOU ARE.
THIS IS A $40,000 MODEL,
BUT YOU KEEP IT FOREVER.
[ GASPS ]
OH, DO -- DO IT AGAIN.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WAS COOL.
MAKE THE EYES CLOSE.
GOD. FREAKY.
Sakezles: THIS ONE IS CALLED
THE ANIMAE.
Herjavec: DO IT AGAIN.
AAH!
AAH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO SIT DOWN
AND LISTEN.
RELAX.
YOU'RE GOOD, RIGHT?
Greiner:
TELL US ABOUT YOUR COMPANY.
WELL, WE STARTED IN MY GARAGE
ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.
I DIDN'T THINK DOCTORS
STARTED IN GARAGES.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
FOR TECH PEOPLE.
WELL, I'M A PhD.
I'M A PhD DOCTOR.
PhD IN WHAT?
POLYMER SCIENCE.
MY MASTERS
IS MATERIAL SCIENCE,
AND MY BACHELOR'S
IS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.
I USED TO DO
A LOT OF ANIMAL TESTING.
THE EXPENSE THAT'S ASSOCIATED
WITH ANIMAL STUDIES
IS PRETTY HORRENDOUS.
WHY?
JUST BECAUSE OF ALL
THE ASSOCIATED PROFESSIONALS
THAT GO WITH IT --
THE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS,
VETERINARIANS,
THE FACILITIES YOU HAVE TO HAVE
TO HOUSE THEM.
IT'S INTERESTING STUFF. YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR $3 MILLION FOR 10%.
YOU'RE VALUING THE COMPANY
AT $30 MILLION.
YOU MUST HAVE SOME SALES.
WE HAVE $10 MILLION
IN SALES.
WHOA.
Greiner: WOW.
CHRIS, YOUR SALES
WERE $10 MILLION
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
$10 MILLION LIFETIME.
LIFETIME.
SO THAT'S MOSTLY
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.
WE DID $5 MILLION
THIS YEAR.
BUT HOW SHOULD I VALUE
YOUR BUSINESS.
WELL, WE'VE GOT SALES
THAT ARE DOUBLING EVERY YEAR.
WE'RE ALSO PART OF A JOINT
VENTURE THAT'S VYING FOR,
YOU KNOW, $150 MILLION
IN U.S. BUSINESS NEXT YEAR.
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
THAT'S DOING THIS?
WE ARE THE ONLY COMPANY
IN THE WORLD THAT DOES THIS,
AND WE HAVE 10 ISSUED PATENTS
THAT COVER THE TECHNOLOGY.
O'Leary: SO, I'M FAMILIAR WITH
THE MEDICAL-DEVICE SECTOR.
I INVEST IN IT,
AND THE PUBLIC COMPANIES
THAT ARE A HUNDRED TIMES
LARGER THAN YOU
TRADE BETWEEN 11 AND 20 TIMES
THEIR FREE CASH.
THAT'S THE RANGE.
I MEAN, WE COULD BE MAKING QUITE
A BIT OF MONEY IF I WANTED TO.
WHOA.
WHY DO YOU NOT WANT TO?
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING.
'CAUSE HE WANTS TO KEEP ON
GROWING THE COMPANY.
I'M NOT AT ALL INTERESTED
IN THE MONEY.
IT'S JUST A TOOL TO ME
THAT I USE TO HIRE PEOPLE.
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN MAKING MONEY?
THAT'S NOT MY MOTIVATION.
MEDICAL TRAINING
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
IT'S A WAY TO SAVE LIVES.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PROFITS?
DO YOU CARE ABOUT THOSE?
I WILL AT SOME POINT.
THAT'S NOT ENCOURAGING WORDS
TO AN INVESTOR.
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
$3 MILLION FOR 10%.
YOU'RE IMPUTING
A $30 MILLION VALUE ON IT.
WELL, THAT'S BASED
ON THE ASSUMPTION
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE
MUCH MORE VALUABLE LATER ON.
EVERYBODY THAT COMES
IN THE SHARK TANK SAYS THAT
WHETHER THEY'RE SELLING CANDY
OR DEAD GUYS.
HERE'S WHAT DOESN'T ADD UP
FOR ME.
I GOT TO BELIEVE YOU'RE ONE OF
THE TOP GUYS IN THIS FIELD.
I'M THE WORLD LEADER
IN THIS FIELD, YEAH.
OKAY.
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE BEATING
A PATH TO YOUR DOOR?
Corcoran:
HE'S MISSING A BUSINESSMAN.
YOU NEED A BUSINESSMAN TO
MAKE MONEY, AND YOU'RE NOT HIM.
BUT YOU CANNOT
BUILD A BUSINESS
UNLESS YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN MAKING A PROFIT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU.
UM, I DON'T AGREE
WITH YOUR STATEMENT
THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN PROFIT.
I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS NOT
WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN
RIGHT NOW.
TOP PRIORITY.
BUT THINK ABOUT HOW THAT SOUNDS
TO AN INVESTOR.
Greiner: RIGHT.
Herjavec: YOU KNOW WHAT?
TO ME IT SOUNDS
ABSOLUTELY LOGICAL
AND REASONABLE.
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA LOOK
LIKE THAT THING ON THE TABLE
BEFORE YOU GET
YOUR MONEY BACK.
THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL.
WELL, WHEN AM I GETTING
MY MONEY BACK?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD ANSWER, RIGHT?
YOU WERE RIGHT, CHRIS.
IT'S AN HONEST ANSWER.
CHRIS, YOU WERE RIGHT.
I KEEP ASKING YOU THE QUESTION
15 DIFFERENT WAYS --
WHEN AND HOW DO I GET
MY MONEY BACK?
AND HOW MANY TIMES MULTIPLE
DO I GET?
GET ME EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.
WELL, IT'S -- I DON'T KNOW
THAT I CAN PREDICT
HOW LARGE WE'RE GOING TO BE
BECAUSE IT'S A NEW SECTOR
THAT'S BEEN CREATED.
SEE, YOU DON'T HAVE THAT PASSION
ABOUT DRIVING THE BUSINESS.
AND I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE A SCIENTIST.
THIS IS WHAT DRIVES YOU.
BUT FOR ME TO INVEST
IN YOU,
I HAVE TO FEEL THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO PROTECT MY INVESTMENT
AND MAKE IT THRIVE.
AND I DIDN'T HEAR THAT
HERE TODAY.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
O'Leary: THE SALES ARE
A LITTLE UNDERWHELMING
GIVEN THE POTENTIAL
THAT YOU TALK ABOUT.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO ARTICULATE
WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS
SHOULD BE.
DON'T YOU SEE THE RISK IN THAT
IN TERMS OF GETTING A DEAL?
I DO.
AND YOU DON'T CARE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I WOULDN'T SAY I DON'T CARE.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO --
LET ME TALK
TO THE DEAD GUY.
I DON'T WANT TO --
I DON'T WANT TO LIE TO YOU.
I'M OUT.
Herjavec:
I'M NOT IN THIS SPACE,
BUT I LIKE COMPLEXITY.
IT'S A BIG BARRIER TO ENTRY
TO OTHER PEOPLE.
I THINK
YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING.
I THINK WHAT'S MISSING IS SIMPLY
AN AVENUE TO SALES
AND DISTRIBUTION
AND MARKETING.
AND KEVIN'S
PARTLY RIGHT --
YOU SEEM A LITTLE HESITANT
ABOUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
I'M A SCIENTIST.
I'M -- I'M NOT THAT GUY.
CHRISTOPHER,
HERE'S MY OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $3 MILLION FOR 35%,
AND AN EQUAL
BOARD REPRESENTATION.
I'M NOT TRYING TO CONTROL YOU,
BUT I NEED SOMEBODY
ON THAT BOARD
WHO'S WAKING UP WITH A PASSION
TO GO TO MARKET AND SELL THIS
STUFF WITH THE SAME PASSION
THAT YOU HAVE
FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.
I'M SORRY, ROBERT.
I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU,
BUT THAT'S JUST --
THAT'S MORE EQUITY THAN I'M
PREPARED TO GIVE UP RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE LAST
MONEY I'M GONNA HAVE TO RAISE.
AND IF I GIVE UP
A THIRD OF THE COMPANY NOW,
THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH LEFT
IN THE TANK TO GET THERE.
THAT'S AN $8.5 MILLION VALUATION
ROBERT JUST MADE YOU,
AND YOU'VE PASSED ON THAT.
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
THE OFFER, ROBERT,
BUT, AT THAT LEVEL OF EQUITY,
I-I CAN'T ACCEPT.
I'M SORRY.
LOOK, CHRIS YOU MADE
AN EDUCATED GUESS, IF YOU WILL,
ON WHAT
THE BEST VALUATION IS.
THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO.
IF EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING
IS TRUE IN TERMS OF COMPETITION,
$50 MILLION VALUATION
IS UNDERSELLING YOURSELF
DRAMATICALLY, RIGHT?
THE -- THE TECHNOLOGY
IS ONLY GONNA GET BETTER.
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA IMPROVE
THE PRODUCT.
I JUST CAN'T MAKE
THOSE DECISIONS RIGHT NOW.
AND TO JUST THROW $3 MILLION
AT IT AND HOPE I GOT IT RIGHT --
IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE VALUATION.
IT'S ABOUT
THE RISK/REWARD.
AND SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
CHRISTOPHER.
YOU'RE SAYING NO TO 35%.
I'M GONNA --
I'M GONNA NEGOTIATE
AGAINST MYSELF.
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW INTERESTED
I AM IN THIS.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $3 MILLION
FOR 25% WITH EQUAL
REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD.
THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
YOU GOT A DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
Cuban: THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU. YEAH.
WOW. GO, ROBERT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
I KEEP THE DEAD BODY.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'LL MAKE YOU
A SPECIAL ONE.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S $40,000 WORTH
OF INVENTORY.
Sakezles: WELL, ROBERT'S
ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE.
WE'RE BOTH TECHIES.
THIS INVESTMENT WILL ULTIMATELY
ALLOW US TO SAVE
A LOT OF ANIMALS' LIVES,
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES,
AND DO A LOT OF GOOD
IN THE WORLD.
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
HIRE A C.E.O. FOR HIM?
YEAH.
HE NEEDS SOMEBODY
WHO'S GONNA RUN THE BUSINESS.
ABSOLUTELY.
HE IS THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE
OF A BRILLIANT GUY
THAT NEEDS A C.E.O.
EARLY ON.
DEFINITELY.
BUT LET ME ASK YOU --
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE AN INSURANCE
POLICY OUT ON THE SCIENTIST.
I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT MUCH LONGER.
HE HARDLY HAS A HEARTBEAT.
THE CADAVER HAS MORE ENERGY
THAN THAT GUY.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A COMPANY THAT WANTS
TO BRING OUT THE SUPERHERO
IN EVERYONE.
