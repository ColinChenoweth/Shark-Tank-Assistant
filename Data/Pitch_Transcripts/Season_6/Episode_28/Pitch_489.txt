HELLO.
MY NAME IS TONY FAYNE.
AND I'M JOSH KAPLAN.
Both: TOGETHER,
WE ARE SUNSCREEN MIST.
SHARKS, WE ARE HERE TODAY
ASKING FOR $400,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
WE ALL GO OUT
INTO THE SUN,
AND WE ALL NEED TO PROTECT
OURSELF WITH SUNSCREEN,
BUT APPLYING TRADITIONAL
SUNSCREEN IS INCONVENIENT
AND IT'S EASY TO FORGET.
AND IF WE DO APPLY IT,
WELL, MOST OF US ARE
APPLYING IT INCORRECTLY.
BUT DON'T WORRY, SHARKS.
WE'VE GOT YOUR COVERED
WITH OUR AMAZING
NEW SUNSCREEN-MIST MACHINES.
THE FIRST-EVER MACHINE
THAT APPLIES
THE F.D.A.-RECOMMENDED
AMOUNT OF SUNSCREEN
IN JUST SECONDS.
SO NO MORE, "YOU DO MY BACK.
I'LL DO YOUR BACK."
NO MORE "UH-OH,
I MISSED A SPOT."
AND NO MORE
UNEXPLAINED TAN LINES.
SUNSCREEN MIST MACHINES
ARE HERE FOR YOU
WHEN YOU NEED THEM
THE MOST.
WE CURRENTLY OFFER TWO MODELS --
OUR BOOTHS AND STATIONS.
THE BOOTH IS OPERATED
IN JUST THREE EASY STEPS.
STEP ONE
IS INSERT PAYMENT.
NOW, WE ACCEPT MANY
DIFFERENT PAYMENT OPTIONS --
CASH, CREDIT.
WE CAN EVEN PROGRAM OUR MACHINES
TO ACCEPT HOTEL ROOM KEYS.
STEP TWO IS
CHOOSE YOUR LOTION.
AND STEP THREE IS
CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND RECEIVE A FULL-BODY MIST
IN JUST SECONDS.
Herjavec: THAT'S IT?
AMBER IS NOW PROTECTED
FROM HEAD TO TOE.
THERE'S NO NEED TO RUB IN
SUNSCREEN MIST.
IS YOUR STOMACH COVERED?
ANDY AND MORGAN
ARE GONNA DEMONSTRATE
OUR SUNSCREEN MIST
STATIONS,
WHICH ARE PERFECT FOR PLACES
SUCH AS THEME PARKS,
ZOOS, OUTDOOR FESTIVALS,
OR GOLF COURSES.
YOU SIMPLY POINT
AND PROTECT.
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE CLOTHING --
SUNSCREEN MIST LOTIONS
ARE MADE
WITH A PURIFIED-WATER
AND ALOE-VERA BASE
SO THEY WON'T STAIN
OUR CLOTHING.
SHARKS, THE SUN SHINES
SOMEWHERE 24 HOURS A DAY.
AND WITH THE RIGHT PARTNER
ON BOARD,
YOU CAN HELP US
PROTECT THE WORLD.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING SUNSCREEN
FOR DECADES.
THEY NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
APPLYING IT.
HAVE YOU JUST SOLVED A PROBLEM
THAT DOESN'T EXIST?
I APPRECIATE
THE QUESTION.
FOR DECADES,
SKIN CANCER HAS BEEN RISING,
AND IT IS NOW
THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF CANCER.
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING EVERYBODY'S
PUTTING IT ON INCORRECTLY,
AND FINALLY A SHOWER
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BEACH
IS GONNA SOLVE IT?
IT'S INCREASING POINT-OF-ACCESS
FOR CONSUMERS.
BUT HER STOMACH DIDN'T GET
ANY OF THE LOTION.
Corcoran: THERE'S
NO SHINE ON HER STOMACH.
IT DIDN'T COVER HER ENTIRE BODY.
YEAH, IT DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE HER STOMACH HAD GOTTEN IT.
SO THE MACHINES
ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED
FOR WHERE THEY'RE GOING, SO WE
CAN PROGRAM THE AMOUNT OF TIME,
AND THEY ALSO CHANGE IN DEPTH
AND IN POWER OF THE SPRAY JETS.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE OUT
THERE IN THE MARKET ANYWHERE?
WE ABSOLUTELY DO.
GO AHEAD, TONY.
SURE.
YEAH, WE HAVE THEM
IN NEW YORK,
IN NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA.
SO YOU HAVE IT ON A BEACH
AS A STAND-ALONE UNIT?
YEAH, IT'S TERRIFIC.
AND TELL ME --
HOW MUCH DO I PAY?
DEPENDING WHERE IT'S PLACED,
IT WILL COST ANYWHERE
FROM $1 TO $5.
IF YOU'RE
AT A LAS VEGAS POOL,
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA PAY
CLOSER TO $5,
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT WATER COSTS.
$5 FOR A SUNSCREEN?
WHY DON'T I JUST BUY
A BOTTLE OF SUNSCREEN?
Herjavec: BUT, JOSH,
WALK US THOUGH IT.
WHO PAID FOR THE MACHINE
TO GET THERE?
THEY EITHER -- EXACTLY.
DOES THE HOTEL BUY
THE MACHINE FROM YOU?
THERE'S
TWO DIFFERENT MODELS
THAT WE GO THROUGH
FOR OUR SALES,
SO WE HAVE
EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS
THAT ACTUALLY
MAKE A COMMITMENT
TO BUY A CERTAIN NUMBER
OF MACHINES.
AND HOW MUCH DOES
THE MACHINE COST?
THE STATION,
WE WHOLESALE FOR $6,990,
AND RETAIL IT
FOR $14,000.
$14,000?
CORRECT.
CORRECT.
NO!
OHH!
YEAH, CORRECT. THE DUAL --
FOR THE STAND-ALONE ONE?
FOR THE ONE-SPRAY.
THE TWO-SPRAY...
Greiner: THE LITTLE SPRAYER.
...WE WHOLESALE IT
FOR $8,490,
AND WE RETAIL IT
FOR $17,000 APPROXIMATELY.
AND TWO-SPRAY MEANS IT
JUST GIVES YOU TWO SPRAYS.
TWO LOTION CHOICES,
CORRECT.
YOU MEAN THAT BIG BOOTH
IS $17,000?
OHH.
NO, THE BOOTH, WE ACTUALLY
WHOLESALE FOR $12,700
AND WE RETAIL
FOR $31,2-- $31,500.
$31,000?!
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S 31,000 SPRAYS
JUST TO GET THE MONEY BACK.
WELL,
WE ALSO HAVE DONE
$325,000 IN THE LAST THREE
MONTHS WITH THESE MACHINES.
SO THAT'S 12 UNITS
AT BASIC--
I BELIEVE IT WAS
SEVEN DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS.
SO I CAN BUY A USED HELICOPTER,
OR I CAN BUY THIS.
Greiner: WAIT, SAY WHAT --
YOU WERE SAYING
THAT YOU WERE IN NEW YORK,
NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA.
YES.
SO WHO WAS PAYING FOR IT
IN THOSE PLACES?
WELL, RECENTLY, WE HAD
THE GOVERNOR'S BALL IN NEW YORK.
WE HAD 1,300 CUSTOMERS
IN JUST TWO DAYS.
1,300 CUSTOMERS
IN TWO DAYS.
BUT HOW DOES THAT ANSWER
LORI'S QUESTION?
THE OWNER OF THAT MACHINE
ACTUALLY TAKES THE MACHINE
TO DIFFERENT EVENTS
IN THAT AREA,
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE EVENTS
THAT THEY HAD THE MACHINE.
Cuban: OKAY,
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY BEING
LIKE THE ATM BUSINESS,
BASICALLY,
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA LEASE THIS,
SELL THIS TO SOME "ENTREPRENEUR"
IN SOME LOCATION,
AND THEN IT'S THEIR JOB
TO FIND THE LOCATIONS
TO HOST THIS
AND THEN HOPE THEY GET
ENOUGH CUSTOMERS TO PAY IT BACK.
THAT'S ONE SIDE
OF THE BUSINESS MODEL.
THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE BUSINESS MODEL IS
WE ALSO WILL DEAL DIRECT
WITH LARGE CORPORATIONS.
TELL ME ONE LARGE COMMERCIAL
OR ENTERPRISE COMPANY --
A CRUISE LINE OR HOTEL.
THAT PAYS.
MGM GRAND.
THAT'S ACTUALLY PAID YOU
FOR IT.
SO, MGM GRAND
BOUGHT A BOOTH.
MGM GRAND IN LAS VEGAS.
WE DID A PROOF OF CONCEPT
FOR A FEW YEARS.
IT WENT WONDERFUL.
"YEARS"?
"YEARS"?
WE HAD --
WE HAD TWO YEARS, YEAH.
WE DID APPROXIMATELY 250 PEOPLE
A DAY ON OUR HIGH END.
BUT THEY REDID THEIR --
THEIR ENTIRE POOL-DECK AREA.
AND SO, WHEN THEY REDID IT,
WE WANTED TO PULL BACK.
O'Leary: IN TERMS OF GETTING
MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION QUICKLY,
THERE ARE COMPANIES
THAT ACTUALLY DEVELOP
BIG VENDING PROGRAMS.
THEY PUT IT
INTO A LEASING PROGRAM
FOR RETAILERS AND POOL OPERATORS
AND OUTDOOR GUYS.
AND YOU JUST SIT BACK
AND COLLECT YOUR PIECE,
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
A ROYALTY LICENSING DEAL.
WHY NOT DO THAT?
Kaplan:
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN TALKS
WITH ONE OF
THE LARGEST COMPANIES
THAT DOES THAT WITH HOTEL CHAINS
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD.
OKAY.
WE WELCOMED THEM IN
WITH OPEN ARMS.
BUT IF IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT'S JUST SOMEBODY
THAT GRINDS LIKE MYSELF --
I'VE BEEN GRINDING SINCE
I WAS 14 YEARS OLD --
THAT THINKS THEY CAN GO
OUT THERE AND GET 12 CUSTOMERS
ON DAY 1
AND BUY 12 MACHINES,
THEN WE WOULD LOVE TO
BE ABLE TO SELL TO THEM.
I'VE BEEN LISTENING
VERY INTENTLY,
AND YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT?
IT FEELS SO, SO COMPLICATED,
THIS WHOLE THING.
THE WHOLE BUSINESS PLAN
FEELS COMPLICATED.
THAT MACHINE IS SO LARGE,
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU SELLING
ANY MORE, HONESTLY.
THE SMALLER MACHINE, EVEN THOUGH
IT LOOKS SMALL BY COMPARISON,
IS STILL TOO BIG.
I'M OUT.
Herjavec: OKAY, SO, I MEAN,
I HEAR YOU GUYS TALKING
ABOUT THIS ROUTE
AND FRANCHISES.
I CAN'T -- I CAN'T FOLLOW
THE BOUNCING BALL.
I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING.
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTARY.
HOPEFULLY, OVER THE REST
OF THE PITCH, YOU RECONSIDER.
THANK YOU.
YOU GUYS EXAGGERATE
EVERYTHING.
YOU TALK ABOUT RETAIL,
YET YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY RETAIL CUSTOMERS.
THERE'S NOBODY AT RETAIL
TO SELL TO, RIGHT?
WELL, WE'RE WORKING
ON A RESIDENTIAL --
NO, BUT SEE, THERE YOU GO
AGAIN, RIGHT? BECAUSE --
WE'VE HAD REQUESTS.
NO DOUBT YOU HAVE.
[ LAUGHS ]
Fayne: RIGHT.
THERE IS NO MARKET AT ALL
THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW
FOR RETAIL.
WE'VE JUST BEEN OPERATING
THIS BUSINESS FOR 3 1/2 MONTHS.
THE REASON
WHY WE NEED TO PARTNER --
YOU HAD IT FOR TWO YEARS
ON PROOF OF CONCEPT.
THAT WAS NOT FULL TIME.
THAT WAS BEFORE WE KNEW
WE WANTED TO COMMIT
OUR CAREERS TO IT.
SO --
[ LAUGHS, SHUDDERS ]
SO YOU GUYS PUT IT ON --
WE PROVED THE CONCEPT --
I GOT TO ROLL UP
MY PANT LEGS.
AND IT'S JUST LIKE --
WHAT YOU JUST SAID THERE
IS THE PERFECT, PERFECT
EMBODIMENT OF WHO YOU GUYS ARE.
YOU'VE MADE SOMEBODY PAY YOU
TO DO A PROOF OF CONCEPT
THAT LASTED TWO YEARS
BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN SURE
YOU WERE GOING TO BE
IN THE BUSINESS, RIGHT?
I -- MARK, I --
MARK, JUST SAY, "I'M OUT."
I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE INPUT.
"I'M OUT."
AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE
WE'RE GETTING HUNDREDS
OF REQUESTS A DAY
TO SELL THE PRODUCT.
DO YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
COMING TO YOU A DAY
TO BUY THE MACHINE?
WE GET HUNDREDS OF LEADS THROUGH
THESE MESSAGE BOARDS A DAY.
WHICH MESSAGE BOARD
ARE YOU ON?
WELL, QUITE FRANKLY,
UM, THE --
THE INTERNET SEARCHES
HAS JUST BEEN ORGANIC
BY POSTING P.R., WEB...
AAH! I'M OUT.
...PRESS RELEASES.
I AM SO OUT! I AM SO OUT!
THANK GOD HE'S OUT!
I'M SO OUT.
OH, MY GOSH.
IT IS A SIMPLE QUESTION!
WHAT INTERNET MESSAGE
BOARDS WERE YOU ON?
AND THEN YOU START TALKING
ABOUT ORGANIC SEARCHES.
BECAUSE I WASN'T INVOLVED
IN MESSAGE-BOARDING.
I THINK MR. CUBAN IS OUT.
Greiner: THIS, TO ME,
IS ALL ABOUT CONVENIENCE.
IT'S NOT REALLY
RE-EDUCATING THE PUBLIC.
LORI, I-I --
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH PROOF OF CONCEPT
FOR ME.
I WISH YOU HAD COME IN
AND HAD SAID,
"WE HAVE AN INTERCONTINENTAL
HOTEL CHAIN,"
OR "WE HAVE" SOMETHING
WHERE I KNEW IT WAS WORKING.
AT THE MOMENT,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH PROOF OF CONCEPT,
I'M OUT.
LET'S IMAGINE WE WALK INTO A ZOO
OR A THEME PARK, OKAY?
WE APPLY OUR SUNSCREEN,
AND AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER,
THE SUN IS BEATING DOWN,
AND YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU ARE REALLY GETTING RED.
NO, I THINK WE'VE GONE
THROUGH THAT MODEL.
SO, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS PROVIDE THE CONVENIENCE --
LOOK, GUYS --
THE OTHER THING,
MR. WONDERFUL --
LOOK, I'M LOOKING AT IT
SAYING --
LET HIM FINISH HIS SENTENCE.
LET <i>ME</i> FINISH <i>MY</i> SENTENCE.
NO. YOU'RE SO RUDE.
HE DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU.
I'M OUT! I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
MR. WONDERFUL,
GO BACK THREE WORDS.
I WANT TO HERE
YOUR SENTENCE.
I'M OUT. WHO'S IN?
Cuban: WHO'S LEFT?
NOBODY.
BYE, GUYS. GOOD LUCK.
BARBARA AND LORI,
IF THERE IS ANY WAY
YOU WILL RECONSIDER
BEING OUT --
NO.
IF THERE IS ANY WAY --
YEAH, GUYS, COME ON!
Greiner: YOU GUYS...
YOU'VE GOT --
...I APPRECIATE IT, BUT...
Corcoran: THANK YOU.
LORI, STOP.
Herjavec: LORI.
LORI.
[ Chuckling ] YOU BETTER GO.
THANK YOU.
GUYS, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
Kaplan:
THE TANK IS REALLY HARD.
I'VE BEEN IN
A LOT OF ATMOSPHERES,
DONE A LOT OF PITCHES.
IT'S VERY HARD TO STAY COOL
AND CONSISTENT.
WE DID OUR BEST.
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
WOW.
EVERY TIME
I ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION,
HE GAVE ME EVERYTHING
BUT THE ANSWER.
YEAH, BUT YOU TOTALLY
LOST YOUR COOL.
MARK, IN THIS CASE
YOU WERE DEAD ON.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A SCIENTIST WITH A WAY
TO MAKE MEDICAL TESTING
MORE HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE.
GREETINGS, ORGANIC HUMANS.
KEVIN.
