HI, SHARKS.
I AM ALESIA GLIDEWELL BY DAY.
AND BY NIGHT,
I AM THE HERO CREATRIX.
I'M KERI ANDREWS,
ALSO KNOWN AS TRANSFORMA GIRL.
OUR COMPANY IS BASED
IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON,
AND WE ARE ASKING
FOR $100,000
IN RETURN
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS
A HERO IN EVERYONE
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE INTRODUCING
OUR COMPANY, YOU KICK ASS,
THAT TRANSFORMS YOU
INTO YOUR VERY OWN
PERSONALIZED
ACTION FIGURE.
SO, THE VERY FIRST THING
YOU HAVE TO DO IS
JUST PICK OUT
YOUR BODY STYLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN YOU UPLOAD A SINGLE
PHOTOGRAPH TO OUR WEBSITE.
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH!
OH, NO!
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
MORE LIKE MR. EGGHEAD
OVER THERE.
MR. WONDERFUL.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS UPLOAD THAT PHOTO,
AND OUR SOFTWARE WILL TURN IT
INTO A 3-D MODEL OF YOUR HEAD.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIS HAIR?
Cuban: OH, THERE IT IS!
[ LAUGHTER ]
ANYWAY, SO, YOU LINE IT UP
WITH YOUR FACIAL FEATURES,
AND THEN YOU GET TO PICK OUT
SOME FUN THINGS,
LIKE YOUR HAIR
AND ACCESSORIES.
Herjavec: THAT'S COOL.
Glidewell: PINK IS TRENDING.
GOOD-LOOKING HERO.
WE PRINT OUT A 3-D MODEL
OF YOUR HEAD WITH THIS
AND THEN WE ATTACH IT
TO YOUR BODY.
AND THEN
WE SEND IT TO YOU.
HOW REAL DOES IT LOOK
ONCE IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT?
OH, GLAD YOU ASKED.
YEAH.
ARE YOU READY TO SEE YOURSELVES
AS HEROES?
YES.
YES.
YES.
ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, MY GOSH,
IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE ME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WOW.
OH, I LOVE MINE.
I LOVE IT.
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE FACE BUT --
OH, YEAH.
AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS
THE BODY IS EXACTLY --
EXACTLY, I KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN,
YOU GOT THE BODY DOWN.
WE ACTUALLY PICKED OUT
SOME SUPERPOWERS FOR YOU...
OH.
...AND NAMES,
SO, ROBERT, YOU HAVE
THE POWER OF SUPER SPEED,
AND YOU ARE THE ACCELERATOR.
OOH, THE ACCELERATOR!
I LIKE IT.
Andrews: LORI, YOU HAVE
IMAGINATION MANIFESTATION,
AND YOU ARE ENCHANTRA.
OH, I LOVE IT.
ENCHANTRA!
Glidewell: KEVIN, YOU HAVE
A POWER I WOULD LIKE,
WHICH IS THE POWER
OF WINE MANIPULATION.
AND WE CALLED YOU
THE VINIFICATOR.
Cuban: THE VINIFICATOR!
WOW.
BARBARA, YOU HAVE PRECOGNITION,
AND YOU ARE THE HUNCH.
MM.
Glidewell:
AND, MARK, YOU HAVE THE POWER
OF SUPERHUMAN INTUITION,
OF COURSE I DO.
AND YOU ARE
THE GAME CHANGER!
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT'S UP,
BABY.
I HAD TO DO THAT.
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE IDEA?
OKAY, SO, I USED TO BE
A VOICEOVER ARTIST
AND A MOTION-CAPTURE
MODEL.
OH, WOW.
SO, I GOT THE LUCKY OPPORTUNITY
OF BEING THE MODEL
FOR A CHARACTER
IN A VIDEO GAME.
AND THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS,
I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT 3-D MODELING AND HOW
THEY TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOU
AND BASICALLY TURN IT
INTO A MODEL.
MY BACKGROUND IS
IN WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT
AND ALSO
IN DIGITAL MARKETING.
BEFORE QUITTING
MY FULL-TIME JOB AT MICROSOFT
TO START THIS COMPANY --
WHAT DID YOU DO AT MICROSOFT?
I WAS WORKING
FOR THE BING SEARCH ENGINE.
I REALLY GOT LEARN
THE INS AND OUTS
OF HOW SEARCH ENGINES WORK
AND HOW TO DRIVE CUSTOMERS
TO WEBSITES.
SO, HAVE YOU SOLD
ANYTHING?
WE HAVEN'T GONE
TO MARKET YET.
YOU HAVEN'T?
WE JUST, LITERALLY,
A MONTH AGO FINISHED
THE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN.
OOH.
Greiner: OH, OKAY.
SO, YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ANY.
DO YOU KNOW, THOUGH,
WHAT IT WOULD COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE AND WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING OF SELLING IT FOR?
Andrews: OH, YES.
SURE. IT COSTS $15,
AND WE SELL THEM FOR $60.
WHAT'S THE CAPACITY
YOU HAVE?
WE CAN PRINT ABOUT 100 A DAY
PER 3-D PRINTER.
WHAT DO
THE PRINTERS COST?
IF THEY'RE NEW, $45,000.
WE HAVE BOUGHT BOTH OF OURS USED
FOR ABOUT $20,000.
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
THAT MAKES SOMETHING SIMILAR?
IS THERE ANY COMPETITION?
SURE, THERE A COUPLE
OF OTHER COMPANIES
THAT MAKE
PERSONALIZED ACTION FIGURES.
HOW ARE THEY DOING? ARE THEY --
ARE THEY BIG COMPANIES?
THEY'RE SMALL.
THEY'RE ALL SMALL.
WE DID A LOT
OF MARKET RESEARCH
BEFORE EVEN ENTERING
INTO THIS SPACE.
ONCE YOU DID
THAT RESEARCH,
WHO DID YOU DECIDE
WAS YOUR BEST CUSTOMER?
THE BEST CUSTOMERS ARE AGED
ABOUT 30 TO 45.
OH, REALLY?
MEN, WOMEN?
SO, YOU'RE NOT THINKING
OF THIS FOR CHILDREN.
ACTUALLY,
WE WERE GOING INTO THIS
EXPECTING THAT MORE PEOPLE WERE
GONNA WANT TO BUY THEM FOR KIDS.
AND OVERWHELMINGLY,
WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE WANTED
TO BUY THESE
FOR OTHER ADULTS.
SOMEBODY REACHED OUT AND SAID
HE WAS BUYING ONE FOR HIS WIFE
FOR BEING A SUPER MOM.
OH, THAT'S CUTE.
SOMEBODY ELSE REACHED OUT,
SAID SHE'S BUYING ONE
FOR HER AUNT
WHO HAD JUST SURVIVED
BREAST CANCER.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
I THINK IT'S VERY CLEVER.
NOW I'M TRYING TO THINK --
HOW DO YOU CONTINUE TO SCALE
AND BUILD COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGES?
RIGHT.
IS THERE ANYTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
THE THING
WITH 3-D PRINTING --
IT IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY,
RIGHT?
AND SO THERE'S NOT
A LOT OF SOFTWARE OUT THERE
THAT IS AVAILABLE
TO SUPPORT,
ESPECIALLY
FULL-COLOR 3-D PRINTING.
AND SO WE BUILT
OUR OWN SOFTWARE,
WHICH IS PATENT-PENDING.
HOW MUCH DID YOU INVEST
IN THIS?
AND IS IT ALL YOU MONEY?
IT'S ALL OUR MONEY, AND SO FAR,
WE'VE PUT IN
ABOUT $120,000.
Corcoran: KERI,
CAN I ADDRESS THE RESEMBLANCE?
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THESE HEADS LOOK LIKE US.
I DON'T THINK
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.
LOOK AT KEVIN.
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT THAT'S A BALD HEAD,
I WOULD NOT SAY THAT
THAT RESEMBLED KEVIN.
THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE MARK.
SO I'M CONCERNED.
BUT SHE'S RIGHT, THOUGH.
IT'S AN ISSUE.
Corcoran: THE SEAM
ON THE NECK -- IS THAT A MUST?
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU CHOPPED OFF A HEAD
AND STUCK ANOTHER HEAD
ON THERE.
IT'S NOT WELL-MATCHED,
THE COLORATION,
NOR IS THE SPACING GOOD.
Corcoran: KERI,
CAN I ADDRESS THE RESEMBLANCE?
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THESE HEADS LOOK LIKE US.
I DON'T THINK
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.
I WOULD NOT SAY THAT
THAT RESEMBLED KEVIN.
THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE MARK.
SO I'M CONCERNED.
BUT SHE'S RIGHT THOUGH.
IT'S AN ISSUE.
I TAKE EXCEPTION
TO THE QUALITY ISSUE
AND THE SEAM
ON THE NECK.
Andrews: HERE'S THE THING --
YOU KNOW, FIRST --
FIRST,
THERE'S ONLY ONE COMPANY
THAT MAKES
THE FULL-COLOR 3-D PRINTERS,
AND SO THERE IS
SOME LIMITATIONS
WHEN IT COMES TO JUST
THE DETAIL THAT CAN BE PRINTED.
PRECISION, RIGHT?
BUT THE PRECISION IS KEY
TO THE SALE ON THIS.
AND UNTIL
THAT'S PERFECTED,
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
A LOT OF RETURNS.
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I DON'T SEE THAT.
MY FIRST REACTION
WHEN YOU GAVE IT TO ME
WAS, "WOW, IT REALLY LOOKS
A LOT LIKE ME."
OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA FIND
FAULT WITH IT,
BUT IT'S A GIFT.
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
I AM THE ACCELERATOR.
YES.
SO I LIKE THE IDEA.
I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF CHALLENGES.
SURE.
I REALLY DO.
BUT I THINK
YOU'LL GET THERE.
I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT BACKGROUND.
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
I SEE RISK.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR 25%.
THAT'S, UH --
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
IF THERE ARE OTHER OFFERS.
WHAT COMES NEXT
FOR YOU GUYS?
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE
THAT THE SOFTWARE CAN BE
OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.
IN ADDITION TO
THOSE PERSONALIZED CHARACTERS,
WE WANT TO EXPLORE DIGITAL
PRODUCTS WITH THE SOFTWARE,
WHERE YOU COULD USE
THE -- THE 3-D HEAD
WITHOUT NECESSARILY
NEEDING TO
PHYSICALLY PRINT OUT
AN OBJECT.
AS A CONSUMER,
WHAT WOULD I DO WITH THAT?
YOU COULD DO...
MAKING AN AVATAR
THAT LOOKS LIKE ME?
YOU COULD DO AVATARS
AND --
YOU COULD TURN IT
INTO GAME PIECES.
YEAH, IN HIGH-END GAMES,
YOU COULD.
GAMES.
I THINK THAT'S FRINGE
SORT OF VERSUS --
NO, NO.
THAT'S ACTUALLY
PROBABLY BIGGER BUSINESS.
I DON'T KNOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHEN LOW-COST
COLOR PRINTERS COME OUT,
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE
ARE GONNA WANT TO DO
IS EMULATE THEMSELVES,
AND THERE WILL BE OTHER APPS
THAT WILL DO THAT.
SO I THINK
YOU HAVE TO RUN, LIKE,
VERY FAST
TO GET SOME MARKET SHARE
WITH A BRAND
THAT PEOPLE KNOW.
AND I'M GONNA MAKE
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MARGINS
IS GONNA GET SHRUNK
PRETTY QUICKLY
AS OTHERS COMPETE.
YOU PUT HERE
A $1 MILLION VALUATION --
IT'S AGGRESSIVE.
BUT I'LL DO 100K.
I'M GONNA TAKE $10
OFF OF EVERY DOLL
UNTIL I RECOUP THE 100K,
AND THEN IT'S GONNA DROP
TO $2.50 IN PERPETUITY,
AND I'M GETTING 5% EQUITY.
SO I'M VALUING
YOUR BUSINESS TODAY...
TRY TO REPEAT THAT.
...AT $2 MILLION.
THAT'S, LIKE,
ONE OF YOUR WORST ONES.
SO I'M SAYING
YOU'RE WORTH $2 MILLION TODAY --
TWICE WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
BUT I'M PUTTING
A STRUCTURE IN PLACE
THAT RECOUPS MY MONEY
BEFORE I THINK
THE MARGINS GET CRUSHED.
AND I'M SAYING
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT TOGETHER
'CAUSE I HAVE AN INCENTIVE
TO STAY IN THE GAME.
HE JUST WENT
FROM BEING A SUPERHERO
TO BEING A SUPER-ZERO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY, I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I DON'T SEE YOU GUYS AS
A MANUFACTURING COMPANY PER SE.
I CAN PROBABLY SEE YOU,
HOPEFULLY,
AS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY...
MM-HMM.
...THAT CAN TAKE YOUR SOFTWARE
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR 10%...
...BUT I WANT TO KNOW NOW
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DEAL
WITH THESE GUYS.
YES OR NO?
I'LL --
I'LL TAKE THAT.
I'LL TAKE IT, TOO.
LET'S GO.
LET'S DO IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S EXCITING.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
OH, NO, IT'S EXCITING.
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME.
WE'LL DO SOME STUFF
WITH THE MAVS.
WE'LL HELP YOU
WITH THE SOFTWARE.
WE'LL HAVE
A LOT OF FUN.
OKAY, AWESOME. THANK YOU.
THANKS, GUYS.
BY THE WAY,
I LIKED MY OFFER MUCH BETTER.
THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD LUCK.
I'M GONNA TAKE MY SUPERHERO,
AND I'M GOING HOME.
[ LAUGHS ]
Andrews: WE WENT WITH MARK
BECAUSE WE FELT LIKE
HE WOULD BE
A GREAT PARTNER.
HE REALLY SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT WE'RE A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY,
AND HE GAVE US
WHAT WE ASKED FOR.
I-I COULDN'T BE
MORE EXCITED.
YEAH.
