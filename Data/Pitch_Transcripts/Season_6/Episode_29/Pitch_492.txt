HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DAVID PATRICK,
AND THIS IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER,
ZACK FLEISHMAN,
AND WE'RE HERE TODAY
SEEKING $100,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5% OF
OUR COMPANY, SHARK WHEEL.
THIS IS THE WHEEL,
AND IT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR OVER 5,000 YEARS.
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
THE CURRENT WHEEL
HAS MANY LIMITATIONS.
FOR EXAMPLE,
THIN WHEELS ARE FAST,
BUT THEY DON'T GRIP WELL,
AND WIDE WHEELS GRIP,
BUT THEY'RE SLOW AND HEAVY.
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE ONE WHEEL
THAT JUST DOES IT ALL?
AFTER 5,000 YEARS,
I THINK WE DESERVE AN UPGRADE,
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, NO ONE'S
BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT,
NOT EINSTEIN, NOT DA VINCI,
AND NOT EVEN YOU,
MR. WONDERFUL.
BUT I DID.
I REINVENTED THE WHEEL,
LITERALLY.
I CAME UP WITH A MATHEMATICALLY
BALANCED DESIGN
THAT'S BASED ON A CUBE.
NOW, I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA THINK,
"HOW COULD A DESIGN
BASED ON A CUBE EVEN ROLL?"
BUT TAKE A LOOK.
WE DISCOVERED THAT NOT ONLY
DID OUR WHEEL ROLL,
IT ROLLED BETTER
THAN A TRADITIONAL WHEEL.
WE CAME UP WITH A WHEEL
THAT'S FASTER,
HAS MORE GRIP, LASTS LONGER,
AND GOES OVER
VIRTUALLY ANY TERRAIN.
BUT WE WOULDN'T BE NAIVE ENOUGH
TO SHOW UP WITH JUST AN IDEA.
WE STARTED OUT
TO PROVE OUR WHEEL
WAS THE BEST BY GOING INTO
ONE OF THE LARGEST CONSUMER
WHEEL INDUSTRIES,
SKATEBOARD WHEELS,
AND THE SHARK WHEEL
IS WINNING RAVE REVIEWS.
OUR WHEELS ARE FASTER,
HAVE BETTER GRIP,
AND ARE SMOOTHER OVER ANY SORT
OF PAVEMENT,
SOMETHING NO OTHER WHEEL
CAN DO.
BUT THIS IS JUST ONE OF
THE INDUSTRIES THAT WE'RE IN.
THIS IS
OUR SKATEBOARD WHEEL.
THIS IS THE WHEEL THAT WE'RE
SELLING WORLDWIDE RIGHT NOW.
IT'S ONE OF THE FASTEST WHEELS
ON THE MARKET.
COMING UP NOW
IS OUR MID-SIZED WHEEL.
THIS IS ON A STROLLER.
IT MAKES THE STROLLER
EASIER TO PUSH.
NEXT UP, THIS IS
OUR LARGE-SIZED WHEEL.
THIS GOES ON ANY TERRAIN,
THROUGH SAND, THROUGH MUD,
THROUGH GRASS,
AND IT JUST LOOKS AWESOME.
SHARKS, I WANT TO WELCOME YOU
TO WHAT IS NOTHING LESS
THAN THE REINVENTION
OF THE WHEEL.
IS THIS FOR REAL?
Grenier:
CAN I GET UP AND PULL IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
BECAUSE WHEN I WATCHED HER
PULLING IT...
IT LOOKS WOBBLY.
...IT LOOKED TO ME -- RIGHT,
IT LOOKS WOBBLY,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT ACTUALLY
DOESN'T GLIDE SMOOTHER.
O'Leary:
LET ME TRY THIS ONE.
AND IT...
I MEAN, IT'S BIZARRE.
BUT, ACTUALLY, THIS DOES FEEL
VERY, VERY, VERY LIGHT.
David: PLEASE, GET ON.
I JUST HAD MY ACL REPLACED.
FEEL THIS.
AS MUCH AS I WANT TO RIDE
THAT THING...
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HATE TO,
LIKE, BE A KILLJOY,
BUT AS I PUSH THIS,
IT'S GOING LIKE THIS.
THAT'S A PROTOTYPE.
WE DO HAVE TO, UNFORTUNATELY,
EXPLAIN FOR THE TREAD ON IT.
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE THAT IS
OUR PRODUCTION WHEELS
ARE THE SKATEBOARD WHEELS,
AND I DEFY ANYONE
TO GO ON THOSE
AND SEE ANYTHING
OTHER THAN PERFECTION.
YOU UNDERSTAND, THOUGH, WHY
WE'RE TESTING THESE, BECAUSE --
ABSOLUTELY, AND I WANT YOU TO.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE --
TO REINVENT THE WHEEL
IS A BIG THING.
WE'RE SUPER PROUD
OF WHAT WE ARE.
WE KNOW THIS IS
OUR MARQUEE PRODUCT
THAT WE'VE ALREADY
FLESHED OUT,
AND WE'RE READY TO GO
INTO THESE.
WE'VE GOT BIG DEALS WORKING.
I'M DYING TO TALK ABOUT IT.
HAVE YOU BEEN
SELLING ANYWHERE?
YES.
WE'VE BEEN SELLING THE WHEELS
WORLDWIDE THROUGH THE INTERNET.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
DOES THE WORLD NEED
THIS SOLUTION?
THE BIG PREMISE OF YOUR
PRESENTATION WHEN YOU CAME OUT
IS THAT THE 5,000-YEAR-OLD WHEEL
IS DEFECTIVE IN SOME WAY.
YEAH.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE REGULAR WHEEL,
BUT THERE'S MILLIONS OF
DIFFERENT TYPES OF WHEELS.
THE GEOMETRY OF OUR WHEEL
GIVES US THE EQUIVALENT
OF A SKINNY TIRE
WHEN IT'S JUST RUNNING
ON A HARD PAVEMENT
BUT A FAT TIRE
WHEN IT STARTS TO SLIP.
WE LAST LONGER,
AND WE'RE FASTER.
THIS SHAPE, ONE LITTLE SHAPE,
IT'S A PERFECT CIRCLE,
A PERFECT SPHERE,
A PERFECT CUBE, A SQUARE,
AND, YOU KNOW, A SIGN WAVE.
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
WHO CARES?
OKAY, WELL,
IN THE SKATEBOARD INDUSTRY,
THERE'S A NUMBER-ONE THING
THAT HAPPENS.
HIT A ROCK,
YOU'RE GOING OVER IT.
WOULD YOU NOT GO OVER
IF YOU HIT A ROCK WITH THAT?
NO ROCKS, NO PROBLEM.
WE JUST GO RIGHT OVER THEM
LIKE BUTTER.
John: HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS?
ARE YOU A SCIENTIST OR...
I HAVE NO DEGREES.
I HAVE NONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WOULD NORMALLY LEAD YOU
TO BE WHO I AM.
NOT A PROBLEM.
BUT IT ENDED UP,
THIS HUGE IDEA HITS ME.
DAVE, THE SALES SO FAR
ARE BASICALLY ON THE SKATEBOARD,
RIGHT?
YES, 100%.
THIS IS OUR FIRST PRODUCT
THAT WE CAME AND MARKETED.
AND HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
WE'VE SOLD OVER 4,000 UNITS
OF JUST OUR SKATEBOARD WHEEL.
HOW MANY DOLLARS IS THAT?
THAT'S $183,000.
REALLY?
IN FOUR MONTHS.
John: HOW MUCH ARE YOU
MAKING THEM FOR,
AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU SELLING
THEM FOR?
MAKE THEM FOR $12,
SELL THEM FOR $69.
THE MEATIEST PART
OF THIS IS,
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
INDUSTRIAL USES.
BUGABOO STROLLERS
CAME TO US.
WE'RE DOING A DEAL
WITH RAZOR SCOOTER.
I CAN'T DECIDE IF THIS IS
NUT BAR FACTOR 6.2
OR YOU HAVE SOMETHING HERE.
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HERE'S HOW I'M GONNA
STRUCTURE THE DEAL
TO REFLECT MY CONCERN
THAT YOU'RE A NUT BAR FACTOR
6.2, ALL RIGHT?
'CAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY
A ROYALTY DEAL.
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU $100,000.
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME 10%
OF REVENUE
UNTIL I MAKE BACK $500,000,
THEN THE ROYALTY DISAPPEARS.
BUT TO KEEP ME ENGAGED
AND IN LOVE WITH YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME 2.5%
OF THE COMPANY TODAY.
THAT WAY, I CARE ABOUT YOU
AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
SO, THIS COULD BE GREAT.
BUT I GOT UP,
I WHEELED THEM AROUND,
BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE WOBBLY.
ALSO, WATCHING THEM,
KIND OF DIZZYING FOR ME.
I AM OUT.
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.
John: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M WHERE KEVIN'S AT.
I THINK THAT YOU GUYS ARE EITHER
CRAZY OR GENIUSES.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000 FOR 20%,
AND I'LL TAKE OVER
ALL THE LICENSING FOR YOU,
BUT CONTINGENT ON YOU
SHOWING ME REAL PAPER
FROM THE COMPANIES YOU MENTIONED
WITH REAL OFFERS,
AND I WILL PUT MY LICENSING
DIVISION TO WORK.
I HAVE NO CONTINGENCIES.
YOU'RE EITHER NUTS,
OR WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT
OF MONEY TOGETHER.
BUT I'M GONNA GO TO WORK.
BUT HE WANTS HIS MONEY BACK.
I ALWAYS WANT
MY MONEY BACK.
OKAY, SO, I WILL OFFER YOU
100 GRAND FOR 15%.
HOWEVER, MY CONTINGENCY IS,
I NEED TO HAVE
A COUPLE OF MY BUDDIES
TAKE THIS THING FOR A RIP
DOWNHILLING,
AND IF THEY SIGN OFF ON IT,
THEN THAT'S MY DILIGENCE.
SO, YOU HAVE THREE OFFERS.
ONLY ONE HAS NO CONTINGENCIES.
WE DO HAVE INVESTORS IN.
WE'VE RAISED $603,000
TO DATE.
AND WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA TELL US THAT?
NOW, THREE OF THE INVESTORS CAME
IN AT A $10 MILLION VALUATION.
Grenier: SO, YOU HAVE
THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE.
John: MY B.S. METER IS GOING
THROUGH THE ROOF RIGHT NOW.
YOU'VE ALREADY RAISED MONEY.
YOU DIDN'T TELL US
TILL THE LAST MINUTE.
YOU GOT SO MANY PEOPLE
AROUND YOU,
I'M GETTING SCARED RIGHT NOW.
SO I'M TAKING MY OFFER
OFF THE TABLE. I'M OUT.
JUST LIKE THAT, BOOM, GONE!
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
DAVID AND ZACK HAVE TWO OFFERS
FOR THEIR REINVENTION OF
THE WHEEL, THE SHARK WHEEL.
KEVIN'S OFFER IS $100,000
FOR A 2.5% STAKE,
PLUS A 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL HE MAKES BACK $500,000,
AND NICK'S OFFER IS $100,000
FOR A 15% STAKE.
SO, AS OFTEN HAPPENS
IN THE SHARK TANK,
THE WATERS CAN GET CHOPPY,
AND I THINK,
BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED
IN THIS --
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
CUBAN'S DOING YET --
I'M GONNA REACH OUT TO NICK
AND SAY, "HEY, LISTEN,
YOU KNOW,
RATHER THAN COMPETE WITH YOU,
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME
IN MY DEAL?"
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE GONNA NEED 5% EQUITY,
2.5% EACH, 'CAUSE I KNOW
HE WON'T GET UP EITHER
UNLESS HE GETS AT LEAST 2.5%.
SO, BUT I WOULD DO IS PROVIDE
A LITTLE BIT MORE DOUGH, OKAY?
RAISE IT UP TO $150,000.
WE GO 50/50 IF YOU'RE ON BOARD
FOR THIS, 75K TO YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
I LIKE THAT.
I'LL DO THAT DEAL.
YOU'RE COMING IN WITH ME
ON THIS?
I'LL COME IN WITH YOU
ON IT.
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT TWO NOW.
Cuban:
WHAT IF I CAME IN, KEVIN?
WE CAN DO IT THREE WAYS.
DEFINITELY.
LET'S DO IT THREE WAYS.
THAT WAY,
THERE'S NO COMPETITION.
ALL RIGHT,
NOW YOU'VE GOT THREE SHARKS.
HERE IS HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.
$225,000 FOR 7.5.%
OF YOUR COMPANY.
WE'RE GONNA SPLIT IT THREE WAYS,
2.5% EACH.
THE 10% ROYALTY REMAINS IN PLACE
UNTIL WE'VE RECOUPED $500,000,
WHICH WE'RE ALSO GONNA SPLIT
THREE WAYS.
A VERY SIMPLE DEAL FOR YOU
TO DECIDE ON RIGHT NOW.
DEAL.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED.
[ GRENIER LAUGHS ]
AND LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING, GUYS.
THAT IS THE DEAL WE WANTED.
CONGRATULATIONS.
[ SHOUTS ]
I JUST LOVE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
DOING DEALS WITH YOU GUYS
BECAUSE IT CLOSES
WHILE I'M STILL
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE DAMN STRUCTURE.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
WHAT WAS THE DEAL AGAIN?
WE JUST WENT
INTO THE SHARK TANK.
WE TOLD THEM THAT WE REINVENTED
THE WHEEL.
WE GOT CALLED
A LITTLE CRAZY,
BUT WE WALKED OUT
WITH THE THREE BEST PARTNERS
WE COULD'VE EVER HOPED FOR.
