HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ADRIANA MONTANO,
AND I HAVE A CATLICIOUS IDEA
CALLED GATO CAFÈ,
AND I'M SEEKING $100,000
IN EXCHANGE OF 20%.
[ CAT MEOWS ]
IMAGINE GOING TO A CAFÈ
JUST TO READ A BOOK,
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE,
AND HAVE A KITTY ON YOUR LAP.
WITH GATO CAFÈ, I CAN MAKE
THAT DREAM A REALITY.
I KNOW [LAUGHS] YOU MAY THINK
THIS IDEA IS CRAZY,
BUT, ACTUALLY, CAT CAFÈS ARE
POPPING UP ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
I WANT TO OPEN THE FIRST
CAT CAFÈ IN FLORIDA,
WHERE, EVEN YOU, MR. WONDERFUL,
CAN COME IN,
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE,
AND RELAX FROM YOUR BUSY DAY.
OUR PATRONS CAN ENJOY ALL
THE BENEFITS THAT CATS PROVIDE
FROM THEIR ENTERTAINING
PLAYTIME ACTIVITIES...
[ TSKING ]
...TO THEIR ABILITY TO IMPROVE
OUR HEALTH AND REDUCE STRESS.
SO, SHARKS,
WHO'S MY PURR-FECT PARTNER?
[ CAT MEOWS ]
ARE YOU GONNA PASS AROUND
THE SAMPLES?
ABSOLUTELY. HERE.
[ CAT MEOWING ]
KITTY, KITTY,
KITTY, KITTY.
THIS ONE IS BARBER.
BARBER?
YES.
HEY, MAN.
THAT ONE IS PLUCKY.
[ PLUCKY MEOWS ]
AND THAT ONE THAT YOU'RE
HOLDING, LORI, IS SALON.
THE MAMA
IS CALLED SCISSORS.
[ MEOWING ]
SO, WHERE ARE THESE GATO CAFÈS
GOING TO BE?
SO, ACTUALLY,
IN BOCA RATON, FLORIDA,
IS A VERY DIVERSE AREA.
SOUTH FLORIDA --
YOU HAVE FORT LAUDERDALE.
YOU HAVE MIAMI.
Woodman:
NOT GONNA HURT HIMSELF.
HE'S A KITTY.
HE CAN JUMP.
HE'S A KITTY.
HE CAN JUMP.
Cuban:
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOPE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
BEYOND YOUR WILDEST DREAMS,
BUT I'M OUT.
YOU'RE OUT?
I'M OUT.
JUST BEFORE YOU SAY "OUT,"
THOUGH,
BEFORE ANY OF YOU SAY "OUT,"
THESE CATS ACTUALLY
ARE RESCUE CATS.
THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE UP
FOR ADOPTION,
SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY
TELLING ME "OUT."
YOU'RE TELLING <i>THEM</i> "OUT."
I LOVE YOU, KITTIES,
BUT I'M OUT.
WHAT FLOOR OF THE BUILDING
WOULD THIS CAFÈ BE ON --
GROUND LEVEL OR HIGH UP?
I SURE HOPE GROUND LEVEL.
I MEAN, IT'S FLORIDA.
YOU CANNOT REALLY HAVE
THAT MUCH.
I WAS JUST THINKING,
IF IT WAS HIGH UP,
YOU COULD OPEN THE WINDOW.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
A CAT PROBLEM ANYMORE.
OH, KEVIN!
I AM SO DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU RIGHT NOW.
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY
WITH THIS?
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY
TO COME INTO THE CAT CAFÈ.
THERE IS A FEE TO ACTUALLY
SPEND TIME WITH THE KITTIES.
[ CAT MEOWS ]
SORRY, THEY'RE SO CUTE.
[ LAUGHS ]
HOW IS IT DIFFERENT THAN, LIKE,
A PET STORE OR, YOU KNOW...
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY GET
THE CHANCE TO SIT DOWN,
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE,
A BAKED GOOD, YOU KNOW?
John:
HOW MUCH IS THE ENTRY FEE?
$9.
[ WHISTLES ]
ALL RIGHT.
Grenier: SO,
DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS?
O'Leary: ARE THERE ANY
RESTRICTIONS HERE IN AMERICA
REGARDING SERVING FOOD...
YES. YES, THERE IS.
...AROUND ANIMALS
ROAMING FREELY?
Grenier:
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
YES, THERE IS,
AND IN FLORIDA,
A FOOD ESTABLISHMENT
IS NOT REALLY CONSIDERED
A FOOD ESTABLISHMENT
IF IT ONLY SERVES BEVERAGES
AND PREPACKAGED FOOD.
HOW MANY SQUARE FEET
IS THIS STORE?
WELL,
I DON'T HAVE A STORE YET.
THIS IS JUST A CONCEPT.
YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONCEPT
WHERE RESCUE CATS...
YES.
...WILL BE IN ONE PLACE
AND PEOPLE CAN COME IN FOR $9
AND SPEND TIME WITH THE CAT,
MAYBE HAVE A DANISH AND A COFFEE
OR A GLASS OF WINE.
MY QUESTION IS,
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
PAY TO DO THAT
WHEN, TECHNICALLY, THEY COULD GO
TO AN ANTI-CRUELTY SOCIETY
AND ACTUALLY SPEND TIME
WITH THE CATS THERE?
OH, 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT A VERY
NICE ENVIRONMENT TO GO.
NO, IT'S NOT
A NICE ENVIRONMENT, BUT...
NO, IT'S VERY DEPRESSING.
YEAH.
I HAVE FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
IN AN ANIMAL NONPROFIT
SOLELY DEDICATED TO CATS.
WHAT I'VE LEARNED THERE
IS THAT 70% OF CATS THAT GO
INTO SHELTERS GET KILLED.
SO THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
IN A FACILITY
WHERE THE ANIMALS
ARE GONNA GET KILLED.
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE GOT
SOMETHING HERE.
I THINK THIS IS AWESOME.
I'VE GOT THREE BOYS,
AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANIMALS
IN THE HOUSE.
AND THEY WOULD WANT TO GO
ALL THE TIME.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE MOST VIEWED
VIDEOS ON YouTube ARE?
KITTIES.
YEAH.
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE
NUMBER-ONE-VIEWED VIDEO
ON THE GoPro CHANNEL?
A FIREMAN SAVING A CAT.
John: WHETHER I'M PROUD
OF IT OR NOT,
I ACTUALLY REPRESENT A CAT
NAMED TARA THE HERO CAT,
AND TARA THE HERO CAT
BECAME A YouTube SENSATION
FROM SAVING A LITTLE BOY
FROM GETTING MAULED BY A DOG.
THERE ARE A LOT
OF THESE POPPING UP.
A PAID PROGRAM LIKE THIS
IN JAPAN IS HUGE.
THESE THINGS
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
IN CALIFORNIA, THEY'RE OPENING
THREE THIS YEAR, SO --
THREE CAT CAFÈS?
MM-HMM, YEP, THEY ARE.
BUT THE CHALLENGE HERE
THAT I SEE IS,
YOU DON'T HAVE
AN ESTABLISHED PROPERTY,
SO AS AN INVESTOR,
HOW CAN WE GIVE YOU
THE $100,000
FOR 20% WHEN WE CAN PROBABLY
PUT UP $150,000
AND OWN 100% OF IT?
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
Adriana:
WELL, I HAVE THE EXPERTISE.
I'M UP FOR NEGOTIATION.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE --
YOU HAVE EXPERTISE RUNNING
A CAFÈ WITH CATS IN IT?
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LONG HISTORY
WITH CATS.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, MY GOD, I HAVE A FEELING
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD
'CAUSE YOU WANTED THEM
TO JUMP OUT OF A BUILDING.
NO, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
THIS STORY. THANK
GOODNESS YOU'VE MET ME.
IN MY SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE,
I WANTED TO BE A MARKETER,
SO I ENDED UP WITH A JOB
FOR MISS MEW CAT FOOD
AND DR. BALLARD'S DOG FOOD.
I GOT A LETTER FROM A WOMAN
WHO HAD A 23-YEAR-OLD CAT
NAMED FLUFFY.
[ CUBAN LAUGHS ]
FLUFFY HAD BEEN RAISED
HER ENTIRE LIFE
OFF DR. BALLARD'S DOG FOOD.
FLUFFY HAD NO HAIR LEFT,
NO TEETH.
AW, FLUFFY.
IT MADE ME REALIZE...
I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE CATS
THAT MUCH.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
I'LL STILL SECRETLY
LIKE YOU.
THANK YOU.
WELL, I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAVE
AND RESCUE CATS.
I THINK IT'S
AN ADMIRABLE MISSION.
KEEP GOING WITH IT.
I'LL BE WATCHING,
BUT AT THE MOMENT, I'M OUT.
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.
THANK YOU.
SO, ADRIANA, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
ON POINT
WITH WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU WANT
TO SAVE ANIMALS,
AND I WOULD LOVE TO DO
THIS DEAL WITH YOU,
BUT RIGHT NOW, AS A BUSINESS,
IT'S NOT THERE YET.
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
SO, I THINK PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO WANT
TO COME TO YOUR CAFÈ
THAT LOVE CATS,
AND IF YOU HAD ONE OF THESE
IN MY HOME TOWN,
I WOULD GO THERE
ALL THE TIME.
I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS,
IS IT'S A CONCEPT.
IT IS A CONCEPT.
AND SO, TO DAYMOND'S POINT,
ANY ONE OF US, IF WE THOUGHT
THIS WAS GREAT,
COULD GO FIND SOMEBODY
IN OUR HOMETOWN
TO GO PUT ONE TOGETHER
AS A CONCEPT STORE,
SEE HOW IT GOES,
AND THEN SCALE THE THING OUT.
SO, FOR THAT REASON...
I'M OUT.
BUT GO GET OUT A LOAN,
GO FIND A GREAT PLACE
WITH A GREAT LOCATION,
GOOD FOOT TRAFFIC,
AND I THINK YOU'LL SUCCEED,
AND I WISH YOU
THE BEST OF LUCK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THIS IS REALLY A HOT SPOT.
IT IS A HOT SPOT.
MY WIFE AND KIDS
WOULD GO THERE
AT LEAST
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.
Adriana:
NOT GETTING A DEAL MEANS
THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
GOING TO HAPPEN.
WHEN I OPEN A CAT CAFÈ
IN FLORIDA,
IT'S GONNA BE HUGE.
IT'S GONNA EXPLODE,
SO THEY REALLY MISSED OUT.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN INNOVATION
IN PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION.
OH, SWEET!
John:
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
THAT'S AN INTRO.
