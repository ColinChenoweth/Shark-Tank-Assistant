HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ADRIANA MONTANO,
Adriana:
WELL, I HAVE THE EXPERTISE.
I'M UP FOR NEGOTIATION.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE --
YOU HAVE EXPERTISE RUNNING
A CAFé WITH CATS IN IT?
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LONG HISTORY
WITH CATS.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, MY GOD, I HAVE A FEELING
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD
'CAUSE YOU WANTED THEM
TO JUMP OUT OF A BUILDING.
NO, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
THIS STORY. THANK
GOODNESS YOU'VE MET ME.
IN MY SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE,
I WANTED TO BE A MARKETER,
SO I ENDED UP WITH A JOB
FOR MISS MEW CAT FOOD
SO, ADRIANA, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
ON POINT
WITH WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU WANT
TO SAVE ANIMALS,
Adriana:
NOT GETTING A DEAL MEANS
THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
GOING TO HAPPEN.
WHEN I OPEN A CAT CAFé
IN FLORIDA,
IT'S GONNA BE HUGE.
IT'S GONNA EXPLODE,
SO THEY REALLY MISSED OUT.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS AN INNOVATION
IN PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION.
OH, SWEET!
John:
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
THAT'S AN INTRO.
