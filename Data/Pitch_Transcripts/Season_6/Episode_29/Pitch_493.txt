HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M JOE WILCOX.
MY COMPANY IS SWAY MOTORSPORTS,
JOE, ARE YOU GONNA TELL US HOW
MUCH IT COSTS TO BUY A SWAY?
WE'RE SELLING ON OUR WEBSITE
FOR $79.99
FOR THE 60-MILE-AN-HOUR,
40-MILE RANGE VERSION.
DO I BUY THAT DIRECTLY FROM YOU,
OR IS THERE A DEALERSHIP
NETWORK?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS FIND
AN O.E.M. MANUFACTURER
JOE, ONE CHALLENGE I SEE IS,
OF COURSE, DISTRIBUTION.
THE NEXT CHALLENGE I SEE
IS MAINTENANCE.
YOU KNOW, THIS THING IS GONNA BE
PLAYED WITH A LOT,
JOE, AT THIS POINT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE ALL
THE SHARKS ARE OUT.
OKAY.
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
JOE, LET ME
JUST TELL YOU THIS.
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE
WHO HAVE STOOD THERE
WHO HAVE HAD SECOND CHANCES
TO COME BACK...
YEAH.
...BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN
THE PRODUCT
AND GOTTEN IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
ALL OF US HERE WOULD AT LEAST
CONSIDER BEING A CUSTOMER.
I KNOW I WOULD, RIGHT?
YEAH. I AM.
GET IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
AND COME ON BACK.
I THINK WE ALL THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL.
THIS IS REALLY AWESOME.
SO, WHY NOT INVEST?
$300,000 IS THE FIGURE
THAT WE -- BINARY IS --
SUCCESS IS BINARY.
IF YOU WON'T INVEST $300,000
TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO WITH IT --
JOE, YOU GOT TO --
WAIT, WAIT.
SO -- SO, MAKE ME AN OFFER.
MAKE YOU AN OFFER?
RIGHT, KNOWING THAT IT'S
JUST MONEY, CASH MONEY,
'CAUSE I'M NOT -- I'LL PICK UP
THE PHONE IF I NEED TO,
BUT I DON'T KNOW THE INDUSTRY,
I DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE.
OKAY, WE'LL GO -- WE WOULD GO
$300,000 FOR 20%.
DONE.
OH.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THIS IS AN AWESOME VEHICLE.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S GREAT, MARK.
I LOVE YOU DID THAT.
I'M EXCITED.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE
PART OF AN INDUSTRY.
OH, WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE BOOKOO BUCKS.
JOE, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY GIVE
THEMSELVES MOUTH TO MOUTH
THE WAY YOU JUST DID.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
CONGRATS, MAN.
TAKE IT EASY.
Woodman: WHEW!
WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE 20%.
I SHOULD'VE GONE 15%.
BUT THAT'S -- THAT'S OKAY.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA
PULL THE PLUG ON ME.
WELL, THAT WAS INTERESTING,
MARK.
Grenier: THAT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS EASY.
IT WAS JUST A QUESTION OF, OKAY,
IF IT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT,
THEN IT'S THE RISK/REWARD,
RIGHT?
BUT CAN I BUY ONE FROM YOU
AT A DISCOUNT?
NO. [ LAUGHS ]
THERE GOES <i>YOUR</i> GoPro.
