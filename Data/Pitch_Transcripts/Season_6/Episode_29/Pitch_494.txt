HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M JOE WILCOX.
MY COMPANY IS SWAY MOTORSPORTS,
AND I'M SEEKING $300,000
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
THIS IS SWAY, A NEW ANGLE
ON TRANSPORTATION.
COMPACT, STYLISH, AND,
OF COURSE, ALL ELECTRIC,
SWAY IS THE THRILL
OF A MOTORCYCLE
WITH AN ADDED DEGREE OF SAFETY,
UTILITY, AND MANEUVERABILITY
THAT'LL MAKE IT THE PERFECT
URBAN COMMUTER.
THE SECRET IS THE PATENTED
SWAY-TILT CONTROL.
THIS IS AN ALL-MECHANICAL
LINKAGE
THAT I HAVE DESIGNED THAT ALLOWS
THE RIDER TO CONTROL THE TILT
OF THE VEHICLE
WITH THEIR FEET...
THAT'S VERY COOL.
...WHILE KEEPING BATTERY MASS
ULTRA-LOW
FOR MAXIMUM STABILITY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SWAY
IN ACTION.
SO, BECAUSE YOU CAN STEP
INTO TURNS DIRECTLY,
YOU CAN ENTER TURNS TIGHTER
AND TURN FASTER THAN YOU CAN
ON A TWO-WHEELER.
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BALANCE THE VEHICLE,
YOU CAN CARRY PASSENGERS
AND CARGO,
AND UNLIKE A TWO-WHEELER,
YOU CAN RIDE THIS VEHICLE
ON SNOW, MUD, AND ICE,
AND YOU NEVER HAVE TO PUT
YOUR FEET DOWN AT A STOP
OR IN STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC.
SO, SHARKS,
HAVE A SEAT AND BE SWAYED.
JOE, ARE YOU GONNA TELL US HOW
MUCH IT COSTS TO BUY A SWAY?
WE'RE SELLING ON OUR WEBSITE
FOR $79.99
FOR THE 60-MILE-AN-HOUR,
40-MILE RANGE VERSION.
DO I BUY THAT DIRECTLY FROM YOU,
OR IS THERE A DEALERSHIP
NETWORK?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS FIND
AN O.E.M. MANUFACTURER
WITH END-TO-END SUPPLY CHAIN
AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS,
SO IT WILL BE THROUGH
A DEALERSHIP,
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE NOW CHASING
A HIGH-VOLUME MANUFACTURER,
AND WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS
WITH SEVERAL HIGH-VOLUME
MANUFACTURERS
TO LICENSE THIS IDEA.
HOW MANY PREORDERS
HAVE YOU TAKEN?
WE NOW HAVE DEPOSITS
THAT REPRESENT OUR FIRST
$350,000 IN PRE-SALES.
AND WHEN DO YOU PLAN ON
DELIVERING THE FIRST UNITS?
AND SO, THAT'S REALLY WHY
WE'RE HERE TODAY.
WE COULD BE TO MARKET
WITHIN A YEAR
WITH THE RIGHT
MANUFACTURER.
John:
DID YOU DESIGN THIS YOURSELF,
OR DID YOU GO TO ANOTHER MAKER
AND HAVE THEM PUT IT TOGETHER
FOR YOU?
NO, I'M A MAKER.
I'M A BUILDER.
FOR YEARS,
I'VE BEEN A TOY INVENTOR
AT IDEO IN PALO ALTO,
CALIFORNIA,
AND I'M CREATING AND DESIGNING
AND INVENTING
TOYS FOR LICENSE
WITHIN THE TOY INDUSTRY.
WHAT IS IDEO?
IDEO IS A GLOBAL DESIGN
CONSULTANCY
THAT DOES
USER-CENTERED DESIGN.
ONE OF THE TOP IN THE WORLD.
YOU CAN WALK THE HALLS
OF MAJOR TOY STORES TODAY
AND SEE MY WORK.
THIS IS LIKE
THE ULTIMATE TOY TO ME
FOR, YOU KNOW, MEN, WOMEN.
DO YOU NEED A MOTORCYCLE
OPERATING LICENSE
TO OPERATE THIS?
CALIFORNIA
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION,
BECAUSE IT HAS THREE WHEELS,
YOU DO NOT NEED A MOTORCYCLE
LICENSE TO RIDE SWAY.
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU INVESTED SO FAR
TO GET TO THIS PROTOTYPE?
TOTAL CAPITAL SPENT,
I WOULD SAY IT'S BETWEEN
$100,000 AND $200,000.
IMPRESSIVE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY PATENTS?
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PATENTS
THAT WE'RE SUPER PROUD OF IS,
WE TAKE THE BATTERY MASS
OF THE VEHICLE
AND WE USE
THIS BOTTOM PLATFORM
AS AN INTEGRATED
STABLE STORAGE PLATFORM
IN WHICH BATTERIES, CHARGERS,
CONTROLLERS,
ALL OF THAT STUFF GOES --
SO THERE'S NO HARDWARE
IN THIS TOP PORTION.
THAT LEAVES IT OPEN
FOR STORAGE.
IT LEAVES IT OPEN
FOR HARDWARE ATTACHMENTS,
ALL KINDS OF
MODULAR ACCESSORIES.
SO, SORRY,
THAT'S A PATENT IS...
THAT'S A PATENT.
...PUTTING EVERYTHING
DOWN BELOW?
YES, SIR.
HOW HARD WOULD IT BE FOR SOMEONE
TO GET AROUND YOUR PATENTS
AND ACHIEVE
SOMETHING SIMILAR?
A LOT HARDER THAN WORKING
WITH US TO LICENSE IT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
LISTEN, YOU'RE A BRILLIANT
DESIGNER.
YOU HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD.
OBVIOUSLY, WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS VERY INNOVATIVE,
AND IT'S INTERESTING.
THE MARKET
THAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER
HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT NOW
FOR ABOUT A DECADE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS SORT OF
A BINARY DECISION FOR ME.
I BASICALLY BUY AN OPTION
FOR $300,000,
AND THEN I HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
IN GETTING
A DISTRIBUTION PARTNER,
A MARKETING PARTNER,
A MANUFACTURING PARTNER,
'CAUSE THE ONLY WAY I'LL EVER
GET MY CAPITAL BACK IS,
ALL THREE OF THOSE
COME TOGETHER.
AND THEN, ON TOP OF THAT,
THE MARKET HAS TO TAKE OFF.
WE'RE TALKING TO
OVER FIVE MANUFACTURERS
RIGHT NOW THAT ARE INTERESTED
IN DOING THIS.
THEY'RE REVIEWING THIS.
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
MM-HMM.
THANKS FOR THE TIME.
UM...
YEAH, I THINK --
Woodman: I THINK
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.
IT'S A BIG HURDLE TO DRIVE
AWARENESS OF THE ACCESSIBILITY,
HOW EASY IT IS TO RIDE,
'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WILL LOOK AT THIS
WHO WOULD BE INTIMIDATED
BY A MOTORCYCLE,
AND LOOKING AT THIS,
IT LOOKS INTIMIDATING.
I MEAN,
I LOOK AT IT, AND I SAY,
"SWEET, I WANT TO GO RIP
THIS THING."
MM-HMM.
BUT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT ALREADY
GOING TO RIDE A MOTORCYCLE
ISN'T GONNA LOOK AT THIS
AND SAY, "OH, I'M ALL OVER IT."
GETTING THE CONSUMER TO SAY,
"AHA! THAT THING IS FOR ME"...
RIGHT.
...I THINK A LOT OF THOSE
CUSTOMERS WILL ALREADY BE
INCLINED TO RIDE A SCOOTER
OR RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,
AND YOU ASKED --
YEAH, THE "WOW" FACTOR,
ESPECIALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO --
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? --
EVERY LITTLE TECH KID --
YEAH,
BUT THAT'S SAN FRANCISCO.
THOSE OLD LADIES IN THE CASINOS
PLAYING THE PENNY SLOTS
WILL HAVE THESE THINGS
ALL DAY LONG.
[ LAUGHTER ]
JOE, ONE CHALLENGE I SEE IS,
OF COURSE, DISTRIBUTION.
THE NEXT CHALLENGE I SEE
IS MAINTENANCE.
YOU KNOW, THIS THING IS GONNA BE
PLAYED WITH A LOT,
AND HOW WILL PEOPLE BE ABLE
TO, YOU KNOW, GET THE PARTS?
WILL THEY BE ABLE
TO GET THE PARTS?
WHO MAINTAINS IT?
I THINK THERE'S
A LONG, HARD ROAD
TO SUCCESS WITH THIS,
SO I'M DEFINITELY A CUSTOMER,
BUT AS FOR AN INVESTOR,
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO SELLING YOU ONE.
YOU REMIND ME OF EARLY DAYS
AT GoPro
WHERE I HAD
MY ORIGINAL INVENTION,
AND MY DREAM WAS TO LICENSE IT
TO ANOTHER COMPANY
SO THEY WOULD GO DO
ALL THE WORK,
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
BUILD A BUSINESS AROUND MY IDEA.
I JUST HAD THE IDEA.
AND I ACTUALLY WAS IN
LICENSE TALKS WITH KODAK,
AND THEY BACKED OUT,
AND THEY DIDN'T LICENSE IT,
AND AT THE TIME,
I WAS DISAPPOINTED.
AND, BOY, WAS I LUCKY
THEY DIDN'T LICENSE IT
BECAUSE IT FORCED ME
TO GO BUILD GoPro,
AND THIS SEEMS SORT OF LIKE
A SIMILAR OPPORTUNITY.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
QUITE A BIT LESS MONEY
IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL AS A LICENSE
THAN IF YOU BUILT
THE BUSINESS YOURSELF.
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
TO SELL THAT MANY...
RIGHT.
...FOR YOU TO MAKE A HANDSOME --
YEAH, BUT YOU DO NEED
THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT.
THE DIFFERENCE,
THOUGH, IS --
HE DOES, HE DOES,
BUT IF HE CAME IN HERE --
'CAUSE TAKING $200,000
AND BUILDING CAMERAS,
WHICH YOU WERE AMAZING
AT DOING, RIGHT?
YEAH.
$2,000 --
$200,000 DOESN'T GET HIM
THROUGH THE FIRST WAR.
WELL, IT GOT HIM THIS FAR,
SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY WICKED SMART.
RAISING THE CAPITAL
WON'T BE HARD.
THE HARD PART IS
GONNA BE TAKING THE TIME
TO BUILD THE BUSINESS THAT
HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE...
ABSOLUTELY.
...TO GO DO ALL
THE THINGS YOU WANT.
YEAH, BUT, I MEAN --
ONE OF THE STRATEGIES IS TO FIND
A COMPANY THAT --
THAT, THROUGH LICENSING
OR JOINT VENTURE,
YOU KNOW, IS GOING
TO HELP FUND THIS...
BUYING YOU.
...WILL EVENTUALLY BUY US.
THAT'S WHERE
I AGREE WITH NICK
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE IT ON...
AND DO IT, JUST DO IT.
THIS IS A VERY
BINARY PRODUCT.
YEAH.
IT'S EITHER A GRAND SLAM
OR IT'S NOTHING, RIGHT?
YEAH.
I LOVE IT.
THANK YOU.
I MEAN, THE CHALLENGE IS,
ANYBODY'S GONNA TAKE MY CALL,
BUT I'M NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO SIT
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION
AND EXPLAIN IT.
I CAN GET INTO ALL THE WEEDS
ON TECH,
BUT I CAN'T GET INTO THE WEEDS
ON THIS,
AND SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT,
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
YEAH, I THINK -- I THINK
YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
YOU'RE REALLY PASSIONATE.
YOU'RE WICKED SMART.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A VERY GOOD DESIGNER.
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
REALLY CONSIDER
CONTINUING TO DO
WHAT YOU DO
AND THEN FIND PEOPLE
TO HELP YOU
BUILD A BUSINESS
AROUND YOURSELF
AND SLOWLY,
ORGANICALLY BUILD SOMETHING.
RIGHT.
BUT I'M OUT.
SO, THE GUY WHO WOULD GO RAD
AND HAM ON THIS THING IS OUT,
THAT'S HOW I GET PAID
FOR MY TIME.
BUT WE DO HAVE
THE QUEEN OF QVC...
WAITING IN THE WINGS.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, YEAH, THIS WILL GO GREAT
ON QVC.
OH, MY GOD!
O'Leary: NO, I SEE YOU --
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A NICE GUY.
I'M JUST KIDDING.
YOU KNOW THAT I'M
IN RETAILERS EVERYWHERE,
AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL.
I LIKE IT.
YEE-HAW!
I'M NOT SURE, YOU KNOW, WHAT
I COULD BRING TO THE TABLE
TO YOU BESIDES THE MONEY,
BESIDES MAYBE MAKING SOME CALLS
WHERE THEY WOULD ANSWER
THE PHONE, GET A CONNECTION.
YOU SEEM TO BE DOING A LOT
OF THAT YOURSELF.
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
OKAY, SO -- SO, I MEAN,
JUST TO SPEAK
TO SOME OF THESE POINTS --
JOE, AT THIS POINT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE ALL
THE SHARKS ARE OUT.
OKAY.
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
JOE, LET ME
JUST TELL YOU THIS.
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE
WHO HAVE STOOD THERE
WHO HAVE HAD SECOND CHANCES
TO COME BACK...
YEAH.
...BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN
THE PRODUCT
AND GOTTEN IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
ALL OF US HERE WOULD AT LEAST
CONSIDER BEING A CUSTOMER.
I KNOW I WOULD, RIGHT?
YEAH. I AM.
GET IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
AND COME ON BACK.
I THINK WE ALL THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL.
THIS IS REALLY AWESOME.
SO, WHY NOT INVEST?
$300,000 IS THE FIGURE
THAT WE -- BINARY IS --
SUCCESS IS BINARY.
IF YOU WON'T INVEST $300,000
TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO WITH IT --
JOE, YOU GOT TO --
WAIT, WAIT.
SO -- SO, MAKE ME AN OFFER.
MAKE YOU AN OFFER?
RIGHT, KNOWING THAT IT'S
JUST MONEY, CASH MONEY,
'CAUSE I'M NOT -- I'LL PICK UP
THE PHONE IF I NEED TO,
BUT I DON'T KNOW THE INDUSTRY,
I DON'T KNOW THE PEOPLE.
OKAY, WE'LL GO -- WE WOULD GO
$300,000 FOR 20%.
DONE.
OH.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THIS IS AN AWESOME VEHICLE.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S GREAT, MARK.
I LOVE YOU DID THAT.
I'M EXCITED.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE
PART OF AN INDUSTRY.
OH, WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE BOOKOO BUCKS.
JOE, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY GIVE
THEMSELVES MOUTH TO MOUTH
THE WAY YOU JUST DID.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
CONGRATS, MAN.
TAKE IT EASY.
Woodman: WHEW!
WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE 20%.
I SHOULD'VE GONE 15%.
BUT THAT'S -- THAT'S OKAY.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA
PULL THE PLUG ON ME.
WELL, THAT WAS INTERESTING,
MARK.
Grenier: THAT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS EASY.
IT WAS JUST A QUESTION OF, OKAY,
IF IT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT,
THEN IT'S THE RISK/REWARD,
RIGHT?
BUT CAN I BUY ONE FROM YOU
AT A DISCOUNT?
NO. [ LAUGHS ]
THERE GOES <i>YOUR</i> GoPro.
[ LAUGHTER ]
