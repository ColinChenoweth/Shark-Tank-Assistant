HEY, I'M CHRIS RUDER,
AND MY COMPANY IS SPIKEBALL.
I'M HERE IN SAN DIEGO TODAY
FOR A SPIKEBALL TOURNAMENT.
MY NAME IS CHRIS RUDER,
AND I'M FROM CHICAGO.
I'M HERE TODAY LOOKING FOR
AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF MY COMPANY, SPIKEBALL.
SPIKEBALL IS POISED TO BE
THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN SPORT.
LIKE ALL GREAT SPORTS,
SPIKEBALL IS VERY EASY TO LEARN
BUT REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT
TO MASTER.
IT CAN BE A CASUAL,
FUN BACKYARD GAME,
OR IT CAN BE HARD-CORE
COMPETITION.
ANOTHER GREAT THING IS,
SPIKEBALL IS ULTRA-PORTABLE.
SO, ALL YOU NEED IS THIS BALL,
THAT NET,
CHRIS, HOW MANY UNITS
DO YOU SELL IN A YEAR?
THIS YEAR,
WE'VE SOLD 29,000 UNITS.
John: CHRIS, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
USE THE MONEY FOR?
WORKING CAPITAL.
WE'RE STARTING TO GET
REALLY, REALLY BIG ORDERS
FROM REALLY BIG RETAILERS.
HOW BIG,
FROM WHO, FOR WHAT?
THE BIGGEST WE WORK WITH
IS DICK'S SPORTING GOODS.
WE'VE GOT P.O.s
FOR 10,000 UNITS TO SHIP.
HAVE YOU DONE ANY TESTS
WITH THEM
TO SEE HOW IT SELLS
THROUGH THE STORE?
YEAH. OUR INITIAL TEST
WAS 100 STORES.
YOU STARTED YOUR TEST
HOW LONG AGO?
UH, TWO MONTHS AGO.
DID THEY TAKE IT TO MORE STORES
EACH TIME?
WE'RE IN 250 NOW.
SO, WAIT, IN TWO MONTHS,
YOU'VE GONE FROM 100 TO 250?
YES.
OH, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
LOOK, CHRIS, I'M GONNA BE
BRUTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.
WHEN YOU --
WHEN YOU WALKED IN,
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
GONNA BE STUPID.
CHRIS ONLY HAS TWO MORE CHANCES
TO MAKE A DEAL FOR
HIS BACKYARD GAME, SPIKEBALL.
SO, CHRIS,
I'M IMPRESSED, OKAY?
I'M IMPRESSED IN YOUR
ARTICULATION OF THE BUSINESS
Cuban:
WAY TO NEGOTIATE, CHRIS.
AWESOME.
CONGRATS, BUDDY.
THANKS, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS!
NOW YOU'RE INTO SPORTS, D.J.!
THANKS, GUYS.
