HEY, I'M CHRIS RUDER,
AND MY COMPANY IS SPIKEBALL.
I'M HERE IN SAN DIEGO TODAY
FOR A SPIKEBALL TOURNAMENT.
WE GOT 45 TEAMS, AND THEY ARE
PSYCHED TO PLAY TODAY.
THE WAY I LIKE TO DESCRIBE
SPIKEBALL IS,
IF VOLLEYBALL AND FOUR SQUARE
HAD A BABY,
IT WOULD BE CALLED SPIKEBALL.
SPIKEBALL IS SO MUCH FUN
BECAUSE IT'S SO ACTIVE,
IT'S SO COMPETITIVE.
THERE'S STRATEGY,
A TON OF TRASH TALKING --
ABSOLUTE BLAST TO PLAY.
SPIKEBALL STARTED AS A FUN,
CASUAL BACKYARD GAME.
IT'S BECOMING
A COMPETITIVE SPORT,
ESPECIALLY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
THANKS FOR COMING, EVERYBODY!
SPIKEBALL!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
POTENTIAL FOR SPIKEBALL
IS LIMITLESS.
THERE WILL BE SPONSORS.
THERE WILL BE
PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS.
IT WILL BE THE NEXT GREAT
AMERICAN SPORT.
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY THINK
I'M OFF MY ROCKER BY TALKING
LIKE THAT,
BUT WHEN WE STARTED
THIS COMPANY,
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY,
AS WELL,
AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL SPIKEBALL!
WE'RE HOPING TO BLOW
SPIKEBALL UP.
THE SHARKS, I BELIEVE,
CAN HELP US GET THERE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS CHRIS RUDER,
AND I'M FROM CHICAGO.
I'M HERE TODAY LOOKING FOR
AN INVESTMENT OF $500,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF MY COMPANY, SPIKEBALL.
SPIKEBALL IS POISED TO BE
THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN SPORT.
LIKE ALL GREAT SPORTS,
SPIKEBALL IS VERY EASY TO LEARN
BUT REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT
TO MASTER.
IT CAN BE A CASUAL,
FUN BACKYARD GAME,
OR IT CAN BE HARD-CORE
COMPETITION.
ANOTHER GREAT THING IS,
SPIKEBALL IS ULTRA-PORTABLE.
SO, ALL YOU NEED IS THIS BALL,
THAT NET,
AND ONE OF THESE BACKPACKS,
AND YOU CAN TAKE IT
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.
SO, STANDING TO MY RIGHT HERE
IN THE BLACK JERSEYS
IS CHICO SPIKEBALL.
THEY HAVE BEEN THE
NUMBER-ONE-RANKED TEAM
IN THE COUNTRY
FOR OVER 12 MONTHS.
THESE GUYS ARE JUST
ABSOLUTELY DOMINATING.
DOMINATING.
[ LAUGHS ]
THEY'RE GONNA PLAY A COUPLE
POINTS AGAINST TIRO UNITED.
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
IN A SECOND,
THEY'RE GONNA SERVE THE BALL
BASICALLY JUST BY BOUNCING IT
OFF THE NET TOWARDS TIRO.
NOW, JUST LIKE IN VOLLEYBALL,
TIRO HAS UP TO THREE HITS
BETWEEN EACH OTHER
BEFORE THEY HAVE TO SPIKE IT
BACK ON THE NET.
NOW, THEY, OF COURSE,
WANT TO SPIKE IT SO CHICO
CAN'T GET TO IT.
IF YOU CAN'T GET IT ON THE NET,
THE OTHER TEAM GETS A POINT.
FIRST TEAM TO 21 WINS.
ONCE THE BALL IS IN PLAY,
THERE ARE NO SIDES.
ALL FOUR PLAYERS CAN RUN
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE THEY WANT.
GENTLEMEN.
I'M GONNA ASK THE GUYS
TO COME OUT HERE
AND PLAY A COUPLE POINTS.
OH!
OHH!
AWESOME.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
WHO INVENTED THIS GAME --
YOU?
NO, BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE.
SO, IT WAS AROUND BACK IN 1989,
AND ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS
BOUGHT IT AT A TOY STORE,
AND THEY AND MY OLDER BROTHER
PLAYED A BUNCH
AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
AND ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO,
YOU KNOW,
THE LIGHT BULB KIND OF WENT OFF.
WE WENT HOME AND KIND OF
DID OUR HOMEWORK,
FOUND OUT THAT THE PRODUCT
HAD BEEN OFF THE MARKET
FOR LIKE 15, 20 YEARS.
SO, WHO OWNS SPIKEBALL?
WE DO.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
UH, THEIR RIGHTS
WERE COMPLETELY EXPIRED, SO --
AND YOU JUST RECLAIMED THEM?
THE TRADEMARK, YES.
THERE WAS NEVER A PATENT.
HAS IT EVER BEEN CONTESTED
NOW THAT IT'S SUCCESSFUL?
NO, AND WE ACTUALLY DID GET
A UTILITY PATENT.
THERE'S SOME GUY THAT'S
GONNA BE WATCHING THIS GOING,
"OH, MY GOODNESS."
YOU MENTIONED, OBVIOUSLY,
THAT IT'S A SPORT.
WHERE CAN YOU TAKE IT?
HOW BIG CAN IT BE?
IT CAN BE HUGE.
SO, WE'VE GOT A GOVERNING BODY
CALLED USA SPIKEBALL,
SO WE HAVE TOURNAMENTS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
HOW MANY TOURNAMENTS
ARE BEING PLAYED?
WE'LL HAVE ABOUT 100 TOURNAMENTS
THIS YEAR.
AND DO YOU CHARGE THEM?
IT'S "LOOSELY"
A FREEMIUM MODEL.
WE ALSO SELL MEMBERSHIPS.
AND HOW DID YOU --
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
HE SELLS MEMBERSHIPS.
TELL US ABOUT THAT.
YEAH, SO, YOU CAN BUY
A "BALLER" MEMBERSHIP
ON USA SPIKEBALL.
WAIT, SAY THAT.
BALLER MEMBERSHIP.
ARE YOU ALL BALLERS?
Grenier:
OH, THAT'S MARK'S WORD.
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.
BALLERS, BABY,
IN THE HOUSE!
Woodman:
WHAT'S THE DEMOGRAPHIC?
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE AGE
OF THE --
18 TO 24 MALE
IS OUR SWEET SPOT.
WHAT DOES ONE COST?
$59.99, PLUS SHIPPING.
CAN I GO TO A TOY STORE
AND BUY IT?
SOME TOY STORES, YES.
WE'RE FOCUSING MORE ON
SPORTING-GOODS STORES.
WE'VE BEEN AROUND
ABOUT SIX YEARS.
THE FIRST FIVE YEARS,
PURE E-COMMERCE.
CHRIS, HOW MANY UNITS
DO YOU SELL IN A YEAR?
THIS YEAR,
WE'VE SOLD 29,000 UNITS.
AND HOW MUCH DID THEY COST
TO MAKE?
UH, A LITTLE OVER $14
A UNIT.
SO, LAST YEAR,
YOUR TOTAL GROSS SALES?
$1.4 MILLION.
AND THIS YEAR, YOU EXPECT IT
TO BE AROUND 3...
BETWEEN 3.2 AND 3.5.
AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE KILLING IT,
THEN, BECAUSE IT'S ALL MARGIN,
SO WHAT ARE YOU -- WHAT ARE YOU
NETTING AT THE BOTTOM LINE?
SO, LAST YEAR, WE NETTED,
I WANT TO SAY,
ABOUT 170,000, 180,000 GRAND.
WHY SO LITTLE?
RETAIL'S GROWING LIKE CRAZY.
SO THAT TAKES YOUR MARGIN.
SO OUR E-COMMERCE
BUSINESS GOOD,
BUT RETAIL
IS REALLY EATING IN.
SO, HOW MUCH
ARE YOU PAYING YOURSELF?
UM, MY SALARY?
$175,000.
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY, THAT MAKES IT UP.
GOOD FOR YOU.
CAN I GO BACK TO ONE THING,
JUST THE PRICE?
SURE.
CAN YOU GET YOUR COSTS DOWN
FROM $14?
HAVE YOU TRIED THAT?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHERE DO YOU THINK
IT COULD GO TO?
UM, MY --
I'D LOVE TO GET IT DOWN
TO THE $10 RANGE.
John: CHRIS, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
USE THE MONEY FOR?
WORKING CAPITAL.
WE'RE STARTING TO GET
REALLY, REALLY BIG ORDERS
FROM REALLY BIG RETAILERS.
HOW BIG,
FROM WHO, FOR WHAT?
THE BIGGEST WE WORK WITH
IS DICK'S SPORTING GOODS.
WE'VE GOT P.O.s
FOR 10,000 UNITS TO SHIP.
HAVE YOU DONE ANY TESTS
WITH THEM
TO SEE HOW IT SELLS
THROUGH THE STORE?
YEAH. OUR INITIAL TEST
WAS 100 STORES.
YOU STARTED YOUR TEST
HOW LONG AGO?
UH, TWO MONTHS AGO.
DID THEY TAKE IT TO MORE STORES
EACH TIME?
WE'RE IN 250 NOW.
SO, WAIT, IN TWO MONTHS,
YOU'VE GONE FROM 100 TO 250?
YES.
OH, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
AND JUST IN THAT BROWN BOX?
I MEAN, THAT WAS YOUR --
CAN I SEE THE BOX?
SO, PROBABLY WORD OF MOUTH
IS GETTING OUT THERE.
LET'S CALL IT A...
NOT A TOY BUSINESS,
BUT IT'S A...
IT'S A SPORT.
IT'S A SPORT.
AMEN.
I DO NOT WANT
TO BE RELEGATED --
DO NOT SELL IT IN TOY STORES
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO
PROTECT YOUR BRAND,
AND AS SOON AS IT SHOWS UP
THERE, YOU'RE JUST A GOOFY --
WOULD YOU SELL IT AT WALMART
IF THEY ASKED YOU?
MAYBE.
OKAY, SO, DUDE, DUDE,
SO, GoPro...
HUGE FAN.
WE DO EXTREMELY WELL
AT WALMART.
GOT IT. ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
THE EXPERTISE I NEED.
YEAH, I WOULD <i>NOT</i> SHY AWAY
FROM THAT OPPORTUNITY.
IF YOU ACTUALLY ACHIEVE
YOUR GOALS THIS YEAR,
YOU'LL DO ABOUT $320,000
TO $350,000 PRE-TAX.
YEAH.
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO PAY 20 TIMES
YOUR CASH FLOW
FOR A BALL AND A NET.
BALL AND A NET -- THAT'S KIND OF
LIKE CALLING YOUR BABY UGLY.
I MEAN, I LOVE IT.
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
THAN THAT.
HE JUST CALLED YOUR BABY UGLY.
LOOK, I THINK THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH
ABOUT SEVEN TIMES
THE CASH FLOW.
IT'S WORTH ABOUT
2.5 MILLION BUCKS.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
WOULD YOU DO A DEAL WITH A VALUE
LIKE THAT ON IT?
NO, I THINK THAT'S DISCOUNTING
IT WAY TOO MUCH.
WE HAVE SIX YEARS --
WELL, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN --
I'M GONNA SIT BACK AND WATCH
AND SEE HOW ENTHUSIASTIC
ANOTHER SHARK MIGHT BE.
I THINK IT'S VERY CLEVER.
THANK YOU.
I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING
WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
BUT NOT OFTEN DO I SAY I CAN'T
SEE MY WAY TO THE VALUATION,
BUT HERE IS ONE OF THESE
WHERE IT'S LIKE I JUST --
I DON'T SEE IT.
ALL RIGHT.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU,
LORI.
I'D SAY YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO COST-REDUCE THIS THING.
I WOULDN'T BE TOO HUNG UP
ON YOUR $60 PRICE POINT...
OKAY.
...ESPECIALLY AS YOU MOVE
INTO LARGER RETAILERS.
ONE THING I'D LOVE FROM YOU,
IF I MAY --
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT I CAN PERSONALLY
GET SUPER PASSIONATE ABOUT.
MM-HMM.
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
LOOK, CHRIS, I'M GONNA BE
BRUTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.
WHEN YOU --
WHEN YOU WALKED IN,
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
GONNA BE STUPID.
IF YOU WOULD'VE BROUGHT THIS TO
ME AND JUST DESCRIBED THIS TO ME
AND SAID, "MARK,
WOULD YOU INVEST?
WE'RE GONNA TURN THIS
INTO $3 MILLION IN SALES.
DICK'S GONNA PLACE AN ORDER
FOR 10,000 UNITS"
ALL WITHIN A FEW YEARS...
I WOULD'VE SAID,
"STEP AWAY FROM THE BAR."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN IF YOU WOULD'VE SAID
ON TOP OF THAT,
"YOU THINK THAT'S MAD?
WE'RE GONNA HAVE LEAGUES"...
ABSOLUTELY.
...I WOULD'VE SAID, "I'LL TAKE
WHAT YOU'RE DRINKING."
BUT YOU DIDN'T, RIGHT?
YOU'RE KILLING IT!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SEE MY
WAY TO A $5 MILLION VALUATION.
I CAN'T.
OH, COME ON!
I CAN'T. RIGHT, CAN'T.
REALLY?
I CAN'T, I CAN'T, I -- I CAN'T.
I'M OUT.
OHH. OUCH.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
CHRIS ONLY HAS TWO MORE CHANCES
TO MAKE A DEAL FOR
HIS BACKYARD GAME, SPIKEBALL.
SO, CHRIS,
I'M IMPRESSED, OKAY?
I'M IMPRESSED IN YOUR
ARTICULATION OF THE BUSINESS
AND WHAT
YOU'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE
ON THE VALUATION.
YOU'RE VERY, VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT IT BEING WORTH A LOT,
AND YOU'VE RUN INTO A LOT
OF ROADBLOCKS ALREADY.
ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM MARK,
AND THEN HE GOES OUT.
THAT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.
SO, HERE'S THE DEAL.
I'LL LOAN YOU $500,000
'CAUSE THIS BUSINESS CAN NOW
SUPPORT SOME DEBT.
I'LL TAKE THE 10% EQUITY
AS A WARRANT FOR DOING IT,
ALL RIGHT?
THE TERMS ON THE DEBT
ARE SIMPLE.
I'M GONNA CHARGE YOU 9%.
I'M GONNA WORK VERY HARD FOR YOU
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
BECAUSE THE 10%
COULD BE WORTH SOMETHING
IF YOU ACHIEVE SUCCESS,
AND THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE HERE
THAT YOU'VE GOT A BIT
OF A VIRAL THING GOING ON,
WHICH I FIND VERY INTERESTING.
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
UM, I THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I'D LIKE TO SEE
IF DAYMOND...
CAN WE HAVE A CHAT?
VERY, VERY,
VERY SMART GUY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN THAT
MOST OF THE OTHER SHARKS HAVE.
THE EVALUATION
IS NOT SPIKEBALL.
IT'S BALLS WITH SPIKES.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW?
SO, HERE'S
WHAT I'M THINKING.
YOUR CHALLENGE IS
MAKING GOODS
AND PROVIDING THEM TO THE STORE,
ALL RIGHT?
YEP.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $500,000,
AND MY AGENDA WILL BE
TO TAKE THAT PAIN AWAY,
WHICH IS STARTING
TO DO LICENSING,
STARTING TO DO MANUFACTURING,
AND SHIPPING TO THE STORES.
MM-HMM.
THAT WOULD BE WHAT
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN
FOR 25%
OF THE WHOLE COMPANY.
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RUN
THE SPORTS DIVISION.
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO RUN THE ONLINE SALES
BECAUSE THAT'S CREATING
YOUR SPORTS DIVISION.
GOT IT. SO --
VALUE YOUR BUSINESS
AT $2 MILLION.
YES.
UM, SO, THANK YOU FOR THAT.
THAT'S -- THAT'S QUITE RICH.
UM...
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 500K
AT 15%?
WE HAVE GOT THIS SNOWBALL
THAT IS ROLLING DOWNHILL
AND GETTING BIGGER
AND BIGGER.
WE'VE GOT AN ARMY
OF AMPLIFIERS --
SCHOOLS, RETAILERS.
BUT I GOT AN ARMY
OF AMPLIFIERS, TOO,
THAT WILL HELP YOU,
SO THAT'S GONNA COST ME ALONE
$200,000 THAT'S NOT PASSED ON
TO YOU.
YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVE
NO FLEXIBILITY.
YOU'RE AT A CROSSROADS
RIGHT HERE
WHERE YOU HAVE
A VERY HIGH EVALUATION,
AND YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE GREEDY.
YEAH.
AND, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
THAT YOU CAN LOSE IT ALL.
I'LL GO 22%.
CALL IT EVEN AT 20%?
WE'RE DONE.
ALL RIGHT. DONE.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
Cuban:
WAY TO NEGOTIATE, CHRIS.
AWESOME.
CONGRATS, BUDDY.
THANKS, GUYS.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS!
NOW YOU'RE INTO SPORTS, D.J.!
THANKS, GUYS.
[ ALL CHEERING ]
HAVING A PARTNER LIKE DAYMOND
JUST REALLY MAKES ALL THAT TIME
AND HARD WORK AND EFFORT
JUST REALLY WORTH IT,
AND, I MEAN,
JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON THE TOP
OF EVEREST RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS JUST AWESOME.
