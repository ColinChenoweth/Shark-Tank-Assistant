MY BUSINESS IS HEART PUP.
IT IS THE WORLD'S BEST
DOG CARRIER.
[CHUCKLES]
[GREINER CHUCKLES]
HEART PUP DOG CARRIERS
ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER
BECAUSE MINE ARE FUNCTIONAL,
FASHIONABLE, AND COMFORTABLE.
MY SLINGS ARE HANDMADE
OUT OF AN ITALIAN
CASHMERE-WOOL BLEND.
THEY FEEL SO LUXURIOUS.
THE LARGE OUTSIDE POCKET
LETS YOU BRING YOUR PHONE,
WALLET, KEYS.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEAVE
YOUR PURSE AT HOME.
THE ERGONOMIC DESIGN
GOES ON BOTH SHOULDERS
FOR A SUPER SNUG
AND COMFORTABLE WEAR.
SO CUTE.
THE CLIP ATTACHED INSIDE
GOES ON THE PUPPY'S HARNESS
OR COLLAR
SO THAT IF YOUR PUPPY'S A JUMPER
OR YOU JUST WANT TO BE ABLE
TO BEND OVER, RIGHT?
[Chuckling]
"PUPPY'S A JUMPER."
YOUR PUP WILL DEFINITELY
HEART THIS, RIGHT, TRIXIE?
"I HEART IT."
AW.
AW.
THANK YOU.
[CHUCKLES]
I ACTUALLY HAVE
SOME CUSTOM-MADE SAMPLES
I'D LOVE TO PASS OUT TO YOU.
SURE.
SURE.
CAN I JUST ASK YOU --
IS TRIXIE DRUGGED?
[CHUCKLES]
[CHUCKLES]
SHE'S THE BEST-BEHAVED DOG.
THAT ONE'S FOR YOU.
CAN I SEE HER?
OH, SURE.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT, ANASTASIA?
UM, $8 FOR FABRIC
AND THEN $8 FOR PRODUCTION.
[Chuckling] WOW.
YOUR MARGINS ARE CRAZY.
[JOHN CHUCKLES]
THOSE ARE THE BEST MARGINS
I'VE EVER HEARD.
WELL, YOU KNOW --
ANASTASIA,
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES?
UH, MY TOTAL SALES ARE
$135,000.
YOU'RE KILLING IT.
YOU'RE MAKING REAL MONEY.
YEAH.
I MAKE A LITTLE MONEY,
YEAH.
YOU'RE MAKING --
WHERE ARE YOU
SELLING THESE?
YOU'RE MAKING
$100,000 A YEAR.
YEAH, I GUESS SO.
I MEAN, OUR SALES SEEM TO
BE DOUBLING EACH YEAR.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU GUESS SO?
I -- YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
I -- IT'S NOT EVEN
JUST ABOUT THE MONEY.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
YEAH, I WANT TO MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY WITH THIS,
BUT MOSTLY,
I WANT TO GO OUT THERE
AND REALLY, YOU KNOW,
PARTNER WITH A STRATEGIC PARTNER
LIKE YOU SHARKS,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.
TO PARAPHRASE HENRY FORD,
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER
TO ANY QUESTION YOU CAN ASK ME,
BUT ANY QUESTION
YOU CAN ASK ME,
THERE'S A ROW OF BUTTONS
ON MY DESK,
AND I CAN PUSH ONE
AND GET SOMEBODY
THAT CAN GIVE YOU THE ANSWER.
AND THAT'S WHY
I NEED YOU, SHARKS.
I NEED YOU TO BE
ONE OF MY BUTTONS
SO THAT I'LL HAVE THE ANSWERS...
[LAUGHS]
LOVE IT.
I LIKE THAT.
...SO THAT I'LL BE ABLE
TO GO FORTH AND --
HOW ARE YOU SELLING THEM?
FOR THE MOST PART,
IT'S THROUGH THE INTERNET
AND JUST WORD OF MOUTH,
BECAUSE --
HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.
ANASTASIA, CAN I SEE THE DOG?
CAN I SEE THE DOG?
YEAH.
O'Leary: I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYBODY MORE RELAXED
IN THE SHARK TANK THAN TRIXIE.
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]
VERY LAID-BACK.
SHE IS --
OBVIOUSLY, YOU BORED HER
TO DEATH IN LAW SCHOOL.
SHE'S WELL TRAINED.
ANASTASIA,
YOU'RE MAKING THIS YOURSELF?
YES, I AM.
AND SO I'M SURE
THEY'RE NOT PERFECTION, DAYMOND.
NO, I CAN --
I CAN GET OV--
I -- I'M NOT A SEAMSTRESS.
I MEAN, THE SEWING, YES,
YOU CAN TELL
THAT IT'S NOT
A-A COMMERCIAL NEEDLE,
BUT THE FABRIC'S
REALLY NICE.
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO USE
THE $25,000 FOR?
THE FIRST
AND MOST IMPORTANT THING
THAT I WILL DO NO MATTER WHAT
IS GET THE PRODUCTION
OFF MY PLATE
SO I CAN FOCUS
ON RUNNING THE BUSINESS.
UM, SO I WILL GET A FACTORY
TO MAKE THESE.
I'M ACTUALLY STILL
HANDMAKING THESE AT THIS POINT.
Herjavec:
I LOVE ANIMALS.
I MEAN, AS YOU CAN TELL,
I LOVE ANIMALS.
YEAH, I KNOW THAT ABOUT YOU.
IT'S GREAT.
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, ONE
OF THE THINGS I-I'VE LEARNED
OVER SIX SEASONS
OF "SHARK TANK" IS
YOU GOT TO GET IN
ON THE RIGHT DEALS,
BUT SOMETIMES, YOU MAY NOT BE
THE RIGHT PARTNER.
SO, I DON'T SEE THIS
AS A WIDE BUSINESS
OR A FASHION ACCESSORY.
WELL, THEY'RE SELLING
ALL OVER THE WORLD.
I DON'T SHARE
IN YOUR VISION,
WHICH IS OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE MAKING
$100,000 A YEAR.
SURE.
POWER TO YOU.
KEEP GOING.
YEAH.
AS AN INVESTOR, THOUGH,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
Cuban:
ANASTASIA, I TOTALLY SEE
HOW THIS COULD BE AN AMAZING
BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT, BUT --
YES, WITH HUGE MARGINS.
WITH HUGE MARGINS.
WITH FORWARD THINKING,
WITH SETTING A TREND.
BUT IT WOULD
DRIVE ME CRAZY...
[CHUCKLES]
...JUST TRYING TO DEAL
WITH ALL OF IT.
IT REALLY WOULD.
BUT --
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU
BE DEALING WITH?
JUST LIKE YOU SAID,
YOU NEED A PARTNER
TO BE A BUTTON, RIGHT?
I DON'T MAKE A GOOD BUTTON.
I'M NOT BUTTON MATERIAL.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I DIDN'T SAY THAT RIGHT...
[CHUCKLES]
...BECAUSE ALL I NEED
IS A PARTNER
THAT CAN EITHER PUT ME
IN TOUCH WITH SOMETHING
OR TELL ME, "HERE'S --"
I WOULD GO NUTS, TRIXIE.
THAT'S -- I MEAN ANASTASIA.
[LAUGHTER]
NO, MARK. MARK. MARK, NO.
ACTUALLY, MARK, WHAT I WOULD BE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IS TH--
ME AND THE BUTTON ARE NOT ONE,
SO I'VE -- I'VE GOT TO GO OUT.
OKAY, MARK, CAN I ASK
WHY SPECIFICALLY
OR WHAT SPECIFICALLY YOU THINK
MIGHT BE A CONCERN?
MAN, ANASTASIA,
YOU CAN TALK.
MAYBE I CAN ADDRESS IT.
[CHUCKLES]
BRUTALLY HONEST,
I'D GO NUTS.
OKAY, MARK,
JUST TO ADDRESS YOUR POINTS --
GO THAT WAY. DO-- DON'T. PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.
CAN I JUST RESPOND, THOUGH,
TO YOUR POINTS VERY BRIEFLY?
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
NO, YOU'RE -- SEE?
ANASTASIA, HE'S OUT.
DO YOU SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
YOU GOT TO GO ON.
DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
HERE, ANASTASIA?
ANASTASIA,
YOU STILL HAVE THREE SHARKS
THAT ARE
POTENTIAL INVESTORS.
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
YEAH.
GO AFTER LORI.
[CHUCKLES]
SHE'S DYING
TO COME BACK.
I'M WILLING TO TALK
TO THE OTHER SHARKS --
MORE THAN HAPPY TO.
SO, LORI...
LORI.
...LET'S MAKE A DEAL.
YOU KNOW, UM, I THINK
THAT YOU SOLD QUITE A LOT
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
OF SOMETHING THAT'S VERY NICHE
AND UNUSUAL, YOU KNOW?
YEAH.
MY FEAR IS
IS THAT IT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE
TO REPLICATE QUICKLY.
I LIKE THINGS THAT ARE UNIQUE,
THAT HAVE BROAD MASS APPEAL.
YEAH.
THIS IS RATHER NICHE.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
UM, LORI,
I ACTUALLY HAVE --
OKAY, ANASTASIA,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $25K FOR 50%,
BUT THE DOG BITES IT.
[LAUGHS]
[GREINER CHUCKLES]
I HATE RAT DOGS A LOT.
I JUST HATE THEM.
I DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYBODY
WOULD WANT A RAT AS A PET.
HOW CAN YOU NOT
GET THIS?
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
COME ON, DAYMOND.
John: WELL, I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT,
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT ALL THE
JOKERS OUT OF THE DECK HERE.
[CHUCKLES]
UM, I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED
TO GET EDUCATED
IN THE PET DEPARTMENT
IN THE LAST YEAR.
MY DIRECTOR OF LICENSING
JUST RUNS IN MY OFFICE AND SAYS,
"WE'RE REPRESENTING TARA THE CAT
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT."
AND I GO ON YOUTUBE,
I SEE TARA THE CAT.
SHE GOES AND SAVES A CHILD
FROM BEING MAULED BY A DOG.
I SAW THAT.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
RIGHT?
SO, I'VE GOTTEN
A QUICK EDUCATION IN THIS AREA,
AND THERE'S MONEY
TO BE MADE.
ABSOLUTELY.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
REALLY?
GREAT.
I'LL GIVE YOU $50,000
FOR 40%.
[CHUCKLES]
THAT'S SICK.
[CHUCKLES]
DAYMOND, YOU GOT A DEAL.
WOW.
WOW.
WOW.
WOW.
EASY BREEZY. THAT'S BEING
PRECISE. I LIKE THAT.
SHORT AND SWEET.
THANK YOU.
HECK, YEAH.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATS.
Herjavec:
WAY TO GO, TRIXIE.
CONGRATULATIONS,
ANASTASIA.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OH, YEAH,
I FORGOT THE DOG.
YEAH.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATS. BYE.
SEE YA.
I'LL GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS
FOR TRIXIE.
[CHUCKLES]
YAY! WE GOT A DEAL!
TRIXIE, YOU EXCITED?
WE GET TO GO WORK.
GO TO WORK!
I KNOW I'M AN INNOVATOR,
AND IT'S A LITTLE SAD
THAT THE OTHER SHARKS
DIDN'T GET IT.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OKAY.
I FEEL LIKE OFTENTIMES,
I AM A LITTLE BIT LIKE
EINSTEIN'S FAMOUS QUOTE
WHERE HE HAS TO ALWAYS ASK
HIMSELF, "AM I INSANE,
OR IS THE REST OF THE WORLD?"
Narrator:
NEXT UP ARE ENTREPRENEURS
WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE NEXT
BIG HIT IN THE TOY INDUSTRY.
[CHUCKLES]
[CHUCKLES]
OOH.
HELLO, SHARKS.
HELLO, SHARKS.
