ANYBODY MORE RELAXED
IN THE SHARK TANK THAN TRIXIE.
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]
VERY LAID-BACK.
SHE IS --
OBVIOUSLY, YOU BORED HER
TO DEATH IN LAW SCHOOL.
SHE'S WELL TRAINED.
ANASTASIA,
YOU'RE MAKING THIS YOURSELF?
YES, I AM.
Cuban:
ANASTASIA, I TOTALLY SEE
HOW THIS COULD BE AN AMAZING
BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT, BUT --
YES, WITH HUGE MARGINS.
WITH HUGE MARGINS.
WITH FORWARD THINKING,
WITH SETTING A TREND.
BUT IT WOULD
DRIVE ME CRAZY...
[CHUCKLES]
...JUST TRYING TO DEAL
WITH ALL OF IT.
IT REALLY WOULD.
BUT --
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU
BE DEALING WITH?
JUST LIKE YOU SAID,
YOU NEED A PARTNER
TO BE A BUTTON, RIGHT?
I DON'T MAKE A GOOD BUTTON.
I'M NOT BUTTON MATERIAL.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I DIDN'T SAY THAT RIGHT...
[CHUCKLES]
...BECAUSE ALL I NEED
IS A PARTNER
THAT CAN EITHER PUT ME
IN TOUCH WITH SOMETHING
OR TELL ME, "HERE'S --"
I WOULD GO NUTS, TRIXIE.
THAT'S -- I MEAN ANASTASIA.
[LAUGHTER]
NO, MARK. MARK. MARK, NO.
ACTUALLY, MARK, WHAT I WOULD BE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IS TH--
MAN, ANASTASIA,
YOU CAN TALK.
MAYBE I CAN ADDRESS IT.
[CHUCKLES]
BRUTALLY HONEST,
I'D GO NUTS.
OKAY, MARK,
JUST TO ADDRESS YOUR POINTS --
GO THAT WAY. DO-- DON'T. PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.
CAN I JUST RESPOND, THOUGH,
TO YOUR POINTS VERY BRIEFLY?
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
NO, YOU'RE -- SEE?

DO YOU SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

THAT ARE
POTENTIAL INVESTORS.
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
YEAH.

[CHUCKLES]
SHE'S DYING
TO COME BACK.
I'M WILLING TO TALK
TO THE OTHER SHARKS --
MORE THAN HAPPY TO.
SO, LORI...

YOU KNOW, UM, I THINK
THAT YOU SOLD QUITE A LOT
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
OKAY, ANASTASIA,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $25K FOR 50%,
BUT THE DOG BITES IT.

I JUST HATE THEM.
I DON'T GET IT.
