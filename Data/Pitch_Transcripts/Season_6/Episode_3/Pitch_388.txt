WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOU
$1 MILLION TO JUST BUY IT OUT?
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS.
WHERE'S THE BAD NEWS?
WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE GONE TO
THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL WITH RAY.
THEN I REALIZED ALVIN
HAD HIS OWN DESIGN COMPANY,
SO I ASKED HIM TO HELP ME
DESIGN THE PRODUCT FURTHER.
THAT LOOKS
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
WE HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST
FROM MAJOR RETAILERS,
BUT WE CAN'T SCALE FAST ENOUGH
TO GET OUR PRODUCT OUT THERE.
Uy:
THIS IS IT FOR US.
RAY'S GIVEN UP HIS JOB,
I'VE TRANSITIONED MY BUSINESS
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS RAY PHILLIPS.
TO GIVE YOU THE GATOR.
I LIKE THESE GUYS.
UH, MARK,
UH, THAT'S THE BIG SHARK.
THAT'S TANK THE SHARK.
HE'S THE BIGGEST SHARK OF THEM
ALL, SO WE WANTED TO MAKE --
OH, PLEASE!
John: OH, WHATEVER.
[GROWLS]
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
A DONKEY FOR MARK.
OH!
WHAT'S YOUR HISTORY
IN BUSINESS
TO COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?
SO, I WORKED AT A RESIDENTIAL
TREATMENT FACILITY
FOR ABUSED KIDS
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,
I THINK YOU GUYS GOT
A NICE BUSINESS.
YOU'RE KILLING IT
ON MARGINS.
BUT IT'S NOT A BUSINESS
THAT GETS ME LATHERED UP.
UM, I DON'T KNOW
THAT I COULD HELP,
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
[GROANS]
Herjavec:
OH, GOSH.
THE -- THE WHOLE THOUGHT
OF MARK LATHERED UP JUST -- UGH.
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR THAT.
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.
INSTEAD OF GOING OUT THERE
WITH NORDSTROM
RAY, LORI DOES HAVE
A VALID POINT.
WHAT IS THE LOWEST
YOU CAN MAKE IT AT?
TWO --
WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO --
WE THINK WE CAN GET IT DOWN
TO $2.50, $2.70.
FOR YOU TO GET IT DOWN
TO $2.50,
WHAT IS THE QUANTITY
YOU HAVE TO BUY IN?
600,000 UNITS OR MORE.
WOW.
O'Leary: GUYS,
THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH.
I CAN'T EVEN SEE THIS EVER
LONG-TERM MORE THAN $12.99,
EVER.
IT SHOULD BE $9.99.
SO, GUYS, WHY ARE YOU VALUING IT
AT $2.6 MILLION?
UH, WE ARE ON SCHEDULE
TO HIT THE $5--
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA NEED
THIS GUY
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT
WITH A MISSTEPPED LAUNCH,
THE FIRST RETAILERS
THAT YOU PUT THE SKUs INTO
YEAH. SO, GUYS...
...I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAY FIRM
ON THE 33%.
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.
YES.
WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOU
$1 MILLION TO JUST BUY IT OUT?
WE [CHUCKLES]
WE AREN'T AFRAID
OF THE HARD WORK
Uy: FOR US,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.
I'VE BEEN DESIGNING PRODUCTS
FOR BIGGER COMPANIES.
I-I KNOW I'M GOOD.
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WHERE I FEEL LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M FINALLY
DOING SOMETHING FOR MYSELF."
YEAH.
WE OWN THIS.
WE'RE DREAM CHASERS
RIGHT NOW,
SO WE DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT AWAY.
WE WANT A PARTNERSHIP,
BUT WE'RE DREAM CHASERS.
O'Leary: GUYS, YOU GOT --
YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION.
YOU GOT A $1 MILLION OFFER,
OR YOU CAN PARTNER
WITH DAYMOND.
YOU GOT TO GIVE UP
A THIRD OF THE COMPANY.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE
BOTH OFFERS.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
John: GOODBYE.
GOODBYE.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
Phillips: THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THAT THEY DEVALUATED OUR PRODUCT
THAT MUCH.
Phillips: I DON'T THINK EVEN
IF THEY'D OFFERED US $5 MILLION
I THINK YOU GUYS GOT
AN INCREDIBLE DEAL.
STEP RIGHT UP!
COME ON, GUYS.
YOU'RE GONNA WIN A PRIZE
PLAYING SOME NINJA CARDS.
ALL RIGHT.
THE BUTCHER'S GONNA SHOW YOU
SOME TECHNIQUES.
Haton:
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
O'Leary: OKAY.
SO, THE FIRST TECHNIQUE
IS THE FRISBEE THROW.
VERY SIMPLE.
GO LIKE THAT.
GO FOR US.
SECOND THROW,
LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT,
IS THE TOMAHAWK.
SAME HOLD
AS THE FRISBEE THROW
ONLY YOU'RE GOING
VERTICAL MOTION.
GOT IT.
THE HARDEST TO MASTER,
BUT MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,
IS THE SIDEWINDER,
JUST LIKE THIS.
Berk:
AS AN ADDED INCENTIVE TODAY,
WE MADE A SPECIAL BOARD
FOR YOU GUYS.
OKAY.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
READY?
[LAUGHTER]
Berk: OKAY.
Herjavec: KEVIN.
NOW, THE GAME IS, WHOEVER HITS
THE MOST SHARKS WINS.
[LAUGHS]
Haton: THERE IT IS.
Berk: ONE.
WHOO!
YOU DIDN'T HIT --
YOU GOT TO HIT A --
YOU GOT TO FLING IT.
YOU GOT TO FLING IT.
OH!
OH, DOES THAT COUNT?
YEAH,
THAT DIDN'T GET ME.
I THINK THAT COUNTS.
Berk: ANYWHERE
ON THE SHARK COUNTS.
FLING IT. FLING IT.
YOU GOT TO FLING IT
IN THERE. OH!
OH, THERE IT IS.
OH, I GOT CUBAN.
THERE IT IS.
WINGED. YOU WINGED ME.
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
FLING IT.
YEAH, FLING IT.
[GROANS]
OOH. OH, THAT COUNTS.
THAT COUNTS.
OH.
OH, THAT --
THERE WE GO.
FLING IT FASTER.
A LITTLE BIT FASTER.
THERE YOU GO.
OH!
OH!
DEATH. YES.
OH, WE GOT A NATURAL.
OKAY, GUYS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE HAVE A CHAMPION.
Haton: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Herjavec: IT IS KIND OF FUN,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.
Greiner: SO, IS THAT, LIKE,
A REGULAR PLAYING CARD,
OR IS THAT THICKER,
OR...?
Berk: IT'S A NINJA CARD.
IT'S A SPECIAL CARD.
IT'S A NINJA CARD.
BUT IT IS A, UH,
THICK, PLASTIC CARD.
DO YOU HAVE TO BUY, UM,
A SPECIAL BOARD
IN WHICH TO USE WITH IT?
THIS IS THE GAME
THAT YOU BUY AT THE STORE.
OKAY. OKAY.
Herjavec: OH, I SEE.
THAT'S THE PACKAGING.
YEP. FOR NOW.
SO, IT'S --
IT'S A THICK STYROFOAM.
IT'S A THICK STYROFOAM.
CORRECT.
Herjavec:
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
Cuban: YOU GUYS THOUGHT
YOU HAD IT EASY, RIGHT?
YOU GOT RUN OVER.
IF YOU GUYS HAD ORDERS
GUYS, LOOK, I'M WILLING TO BE
A DISCIPLE OF THE NINJA WAY,
BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT
AS A FIT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
THE NINJA WOULD DO ANYTHING,
INCLUDING LAY HIS LIFE DOWN,
IN THE SERVICE
OF A GREATER GOOD.
YOU CAN'T EVEN
PICK UP A PHONE
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU, SHARKS.
[CUBAN CHUCKLES]
HAI.
NOW WE GOT TO DUCK.
Haton:
THE SHARKS CAME DOWN ON US
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PICK UP
THE PHONE,
BUT WE JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE OUR PRODUCT
WAS READY
TO GO TO MARKET YET.
YOU GUYS WANT
TO SEE THEM?
THEY'RE WORN ON THE BODY,
NOT IN THE --
IT'S NOT IN THE APPAREL.
RIGHT.
Greiner: OH, OKAY.
YOU CAN PUT IT
IN ANY CLOTHES.
OUR BASIC KIT
COMES WITH SIX SENSORS.
THERE'S FOUR DRUM PADS
THAT CAN GO IN YOUR CLOTHES,
YOU JUST TAP YOUR PANTS
TO BUY IT RIGHT THERE.
COME ON. THAT IS THE DUMBEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
GUYS,
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW.
CAN WE, UH,
CONFER IN THE HALLWAY?
YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS IN "SHARK TANK"
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK --
NASTY, NASTY THINGS.
WHAT IS WRONG?
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
GUYS, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
RIGHT NOW.
CAN WE, UH,
CONFER IN THE HALLWAY?
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
IN "SHARK TANK"
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK --
NASTY, NASTY THINGS.
WHAT IS WRONG?
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
THANK YOU.
NASTY THINGS.
WELL,
I LIKE DAYMOND'S OFFER
'CAUSE IT'S MORE MONEY
BUT YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
A FORCEFUL WAY TO GET THERE.
I WAS THE FIRST GUY
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I THOUGHT I MADE YOU
A FAIR OFFER.
THEN YOU LISTENED
TO DAYMOND'S OFFER,
WHICH IS VERY RESPECTFUL,
GUYS, IT'S TOO LATE.
...TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER?
LET SOMEONE ELSE
HAVE A CHANCE.
LIFE DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
WELL, SHOULD HAVE GONE
WITH DAYMOND.
TOLD YOU.
INCREDIBLE.
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.
NOW, THAT WAS
THE FIRST DATE.
IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
AFTER THAT.
I GUARANTEE YOU
THIS HAPPENS TO THEM
EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
I CAN IMAGINE THEM
TRYING TO PICK OUT LUNCH.
WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING
ABOUT THEM? THEY'RE GONE!
THEY'RE DEAD.
THEY'RE GONE.
