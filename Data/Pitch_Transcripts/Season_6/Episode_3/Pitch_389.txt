AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT,
OR $10 MILLION,
BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.
Narrator:
IN SEASON 3, FLEETWOOD HICKS
MADE A DEAL
WITH MARK AND BARBARA
FOR HIS CUSTOM BICYCLE COMPANY,
VILLY CUSTOMS.
MY NAME IS DUSTIN,
A.K.A. "THE RED DRAGON."
AND I'M KEN.
THEY CALL ME "THE BUTCHER."
WE'RE HERE
LOOKING FOR $60,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR
30% OF OUR COMPANY.
SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE 15th CENTURY,
MANKIND
HAS BEEN FASCINATED
BY THE MYSTERIOUS WAYS
OF THE NINJA.
HA!
A NINJA IS CUNNING.
A NINJA IS WISE.
A NINJA CAN ADAPT TO THEIR
SURROUNDINGS SEAMLESSLY,
OFTEN MAKING THEMSELVES
INVISIBLE TO THEIR ENEMIES.
NINJAS FOLLOW
A MORAL CODE
REGARDING DIGNITY, HONOR,
AND RESPECT.
[CHUCKLES]
IT IS FOR THESE REASONS
THAT EVERYONE WANTS
TO BE A NINJA,
AND NOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
WE CAN ALL FINALLY BE NINJAS
IN OUR OWN RIGHT.
INTRODUCING...
NINJA CARDS!
Herjavec: NO.
Greiner: PRETTY COOL.
OH, MY GOSH.
THAT IS SO COOL.
THAT IS GREAT.
ESSENTIALLY, OUR GAME
IS LIKE DARTS BUT WITH CARDS.
YOU CAN PLAY GAMES LIKE
AROUND THE WORLD, HORSE, 21.
YOU CAN EVEN MAKE UP
YOUR OWN GAMES.
THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE ENDLESS.
BUT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND
AND APPRECIATE THIS GAME,
YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT.
SO, AT THIS POINT,
WE'D LIKE TO INVITE TWO SHARKS
TO COMPETE
IN A NINJA CARD BATTLE.
OH! OH! OH! OH!
IT'S GOT TO BE ME.
IT'S GOT TO BE ME.
[ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY]
