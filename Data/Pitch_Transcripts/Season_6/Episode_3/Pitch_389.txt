WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOU
$1 MILLION TO JUST BUY IT OUT?
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS.
WHERE'S THE BAD NEWS?
WE MADE 100 UNITS,
AND WE SOLD THEM ALL.
WHAT?
THAT'S SICK.

Narrator:

LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,

AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
MY NAME IS RAY.
AND I'M ALVIN.
AND WE ARE FROM
THE EAGLE ROCK NEIGHBORHOOD
IN LOS ANGELES,
CALIFORNIA.
RAY AND I GREW UP
IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD,
NEVER REALLY HUNG OUT
UNTIL I MARRIED MY WIFE,
WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE GONE TO
THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL WITH RAY.
NOW WE'RE CLOSE FRIENDS
AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, TOO.
OH,
THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.
I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
FOR THIS BUSINESS
WHILE WORKING AT A TREATMENT
FACILITY FOR CHILDREN,
AND ONE OF THE MORE
DIFFICULT TIMES WAS BATH TIME.
THERE WAS ONE KID
IN PARTICULAR
WHO HAD REFUSED TO BATHE
FOR A FEW DAYS.
HE LET ME KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS,
AND THAT'S WHEN I HAD
MY "AHA" MOMENT.
I SPENT YEARS DEVELOPING
AND IMPROVING A PRODUCT,
BUT STILL,
SOMETHING WAS MISSING.
THEN I REALIZED ALVIN
HAD HIS OWN DESIGN COMPANY,
SO I ASKED HIM TO HELP ME
DESIGN THE PRODUCT FURTHER.
THAT LOOKS
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
WE HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST
FROM MAJOR RETAILERS,
BUT WE CAN'T SCALE FAST ENOUGH
TO GET OUR PRODUCT OUT THERE.
WE NEED THE SHARKS'
EXPERTISE AND CAPITAL
TO TAKE OUR PRODUCT
NATIONWIDE.
Uy:
THIS IS IT FOR US.
RAY'S GIVEN UP HIS JOB,
I'VE TRANSITIONED MY BUSINESS
AND TOTALLY FOCUSED ON
THIS PRODUCT, SO WE'RE ALL IN.
ALL IN.
ALL IN, YEAH.
ALL IN.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS RAY PHILLIPS.
AND I'M ALVIN UY.
WE'RE THE FOUNDERS OF SoapSox
FROM EAGLE ROCK, CALIFORNIA.
WE'RE HERE TODAY
SEEKING $260,000
FOR A 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS,
MEET SoapSox --
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF WASHCLOTHS FOR KIDS.
SHARKS, AS PARENTS,
MAYBE YOU STRUGGLE WITH THIS --
YOU COME HOME
AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK,
YOU START THE EVENING ROUTINE
OF HOMEWORK, DINNERTIME,
THEN BATH TIME.
[BOTH GROAN]
BATH TIME.
BATH TIME.
HOW DO I GET MY KID
TO BATHE
WITHOUT THE SCREAMING
AND CRYING?
[GROANS]
WELL, SHARKS,
WE HAVE THE SOLUTION.
WHAT WE CAME UP WITH IS AN
ADORABLE NEW LINE OF PLUSH TOYS
THAT KIDS CAN TAKE FROM PLAYTIME
TO BATH TIME.
OH, LORD.
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS TAKE
A CUTE AND CUDDLY PLUSH TOY,
TURNED IT
INTO A BATH AID
BY SIMPLY REPLACING
ITS INNER STUFFING
WITH ANTIMICROBIAL SPONGE
AND REPLACING THE OUTER MATERIAL
WITH TERRY CLOTH.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.
SIMPLY TAKE SOAP AND PUT IT
IN TANK THE SHARK'S MOUTH.
[LAUGHTER]
OR UNDER THE SHELL
OF TAYLOR THE TURTLE.
SIMPLY ADD WATER...
...USE THE UNIQUELY
DESIGNED FINGER POCKETS
FOR BETTER HANDLING,
WORK INTO A LATHER...
AND LET BATH TIME BEGIN.
AND AFTER BATH TIME...
...SIMPLY HANG SoapSox
TO DRY
OR JUST TOSS IT
INTO THE LAUNDRY.
SO, SHARKS,
WHY DON'T YOU LET US
THROW SOME SoapSox
INTO YOUR TANK
AND YOU THROW SOME CASH
INTO OURS?
SO, WE'RE GONNA HAND OUT SAMPLES
TO YOU NOW.
WE HAVE SEVEN
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
THAT WE LAUNCHED WITH.
UM...
[CHUCKLES]
MR. HERJAVEC,
WE STARTED WITH YOU
WITH THE WONDERFUL HIPPO,
UH, BECAUSE --
I GET THE PINK HIPPO?
[GREINER CHUCKLES]
YOU GET THE PINK HIPPO
BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,
HIPPOS ARE NICE AND CUDDLY
AND THEY LOOK THE PART,
BUT THEY'RE THE MOST DANGEROUS
ANIMALS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD.
THANK YOU. YEAH.
OH, YOU KNOW
HOW TO FLATTER.
YEAH.
WHAT'S THE TURTLE?
OKAY,
THIS IS OUR BEST-SELLING TURTLE,
AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAD THAT.
MR. WONDERFUL, YOU'RE KIND OF
KNOWN TO SPIT SOME FIRE,
SO WE FIGURED WE'D COMPLIMENT
YOU WITH OUR WONDERFUL DRAGON.
IT'S THE DRAGON OF TRUTH.
DAYMOND, YOU'RE MORE OF A, LIKE,
SIT-AND-WAIT KIND OF GUY
FOR THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO GET YOUR DEALS,
SO WE FIGURED
IT'D BE APPROPRIATE
TO GIVE YOU THE GATOR.
I LIKE THESE GUYS.
UH, MARK,
UH, THAT'S THE BIG SHARK.
THAT'S TANK THE SHARK.
HE'S THE BIGGEST SHARK OF THEM
ALL, SO WE WANTED TO MAKE --
OH, PLEASE!
John: OH, WHATEVER.
[GROWLS]
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
A DONKEY FOR MARK.
OH!
WHAT'S YOUR HISTORY
IN BUSINESS
TO COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?
SO, I WORKED AT A RESIDENTIAL
TREATMENT FACILITY
FOR ABUSED KIDS
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,
AND ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT
TIMES WAS BATH TIME.
WE HAD ONE KID IN PARTICULAR
WHO HAD REFUSED TO BATHE,
AND WE WAS CARRYING
A LITTLE STUFFED ANIMAL.
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"THAT MEAN LADY
"WON'T LET ME
TAKE MY STUFFED ANIMAL
INTO THE BATHTUB WITH ME."
AND SO I SAID, "WE CAN --
WE CAN FIX THAT. HOLD ON."
AND I THOUGHT
OUTSIDE OF THE BOX,
I HAD THE STAFF GRAB
ANOTHER STUFFED ANIMAL,
MADE IT HOLD SOAP,
LATHERED IT UP,
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"OKAY, I'LL GO."
AND SO, AFTER THAT,
THEN THEY'RE LIKE,
"HEY,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT."
AND SO THEN,
I PARTNERED WITH ALVIN,
WHO HAS A BACKGROUND IN DESIGN
AND PRODUCT DESIGN,
AND HE MADE THE MAGIC
HAPPEN.
GIVE US A SALES PROFILE
AND WHICH RETAILERS YOU'RE IN.
THIS IS A RETAIL-ORIENTED
PRODUCT.
SO, WE'VE BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR SIX MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $300,000
IN SALES.
SOME OF THE MAJOR RETAILERS
IS NORDSTROM'S.
THEY'RE GONNA BE ROLLING US OUT
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
I'M GUESSING THAT YOU HAVE
A PATENT PENDING ON THIS.
SO, WE HAVE
OUR DESIGN PATENT PENDING
AND OUR UTILITY PATENT
PENDING.
AND WHAT DO THEY
RETAIL FOR?
WE ARE RETAILING THEM
FOR $19.95.
WHAT DO THEY COST YOU
TO MAKE?
UH, THEY COST $3.66
CURRENTLY.
RAY, TELL ME ABOUT THE FORECAST
FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR.
WE'RE ON TRACK
TO DO $576,000
FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THIS YEAR.
NEXT YEAR, WE ARE ESTIMATED
TO DO $2.4 MILLION.
O'Leary:
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
YES.
20 BUCKS FOR A SPONGE...
YEAH.
...IS A LOT OF MONEY...
I AGREE.
...'CAUSE EVERY OTHER PLUSH TOY
IN THE STORE
THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS
IS $4.99, $5.99.
THIS IS A REALLY PREMIUM
PLUSH TOY...
YES.
...LIKE, THE FIRST IN MY LIFE
I'VE EVER SEEN FOR $20.
I THINK YOU GUYS GOT
A NICE BUSINESS.
YOU'RE KILLING IT
ON MARGINS.
BUT IT'S NOT A BUSINESS
THAT GETS ME LATHERED UP.
UM, I DON'T KNOW
THAT I COULD HELP,
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
[GROANS]
Herjavec:
OH, GOSH.
THE -- THE WHOLE THOUGHT
OF MARK LATHERED UP JUST -- UGH.
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR THAT.
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.
INSTEAD OF GOING OUT THERE
WITH NORDSTROM
AND PUTTING IT OUT
AT $19.99,
CAN YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR MANUFACTURERS
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY
YOU CAN GET THE PRICE DOWN
AND THEN NOT TAKE
SUCH A HEFTY MARGIN?
YOU HAVE
A REALLY HEFTY MARGIN.
RAY, LORI DOES HAVE
A VALID POINT.
WHAT IS THE LOWEST
YOU CAN MAKE IT AT?
TWO --
WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO --
WE THINK WE CAN GET IT DOWN
TO $2.50, $2.70.
FOR YOU TO GET IT DOWN
TO $2.50,
WHAT IS THE QUANTITY
YOU HAVE TO BUY IN?
600,000 UNITS OR MORE.
WOW.
O'Leary: GUYS,
THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH.
I CAN'T EVEN SEE THIS EVER
LONG-TERM MORE THAN $12.99,
EVER.
IT SHOULD BE $9.99.
AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH
$2.6 MILLION.
I'M OUT.
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE PROVEN IS,
YOU HAVE A GREAT CONCEPT.
BUT AT A $2.6 MILLION
VALUE,
FOR ME TODAY
TO GIVE YOU $260,000,
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE QUITE PROVEN
THAT MY MONEY
WANTS TO GO THERE.
I'M AFRAID
I'LL TAKE A BATH.
THANK YOU.
I'M OUT.
SO, GUYS, WHY ARE YOU VALUING IT
AT $2.6 MILLION?
UH, WE ARE ON SCHEDULE
TO HIT THE $5--
JUST UNDER $600,000
BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND --
ON SCHEDULE 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
EXISTING ORDERS
THAT WILL TAKE YOU THERE?
YES.
OKAY.
SO, I WANT TO BE
PART OF THIS,
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A VALUATION
OF $2.6 MILLION.
I'LL GIVE YOU $260,000
FOR 33%.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
UH, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO HEAR, IF LORI --
I'M FINE WITH THIS,
SO LET'S MOVE IT ALONG.
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
I THINK IT'S REALLY
A SMART PRODUCT.
GREAT JOB.
REALLY CLEAR WHAT IT IS,
THE NAME IS FANTASTIC --
SoapSox.
THEN I HAVE THE OTHER SIDE
OF ME THAT'S SAYING,
YOU HAVE A PATENT PENDING,
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.
AND IN THE TIME THAT IT'LL TAKE
FOR YOU TO GET IT,
IT MIGHT BE TWO YEARS,
THREE YEARS,
AND SOMEONE ELSE
MAY COPY IT.
IF YOU WERE AT A LOWER PRICE,
YOU COULD BLITZ THE MARKET.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
SO, COULD YOU RESTATE
YOUR OFFER, DAYMOND,
JUST SO
THAT WE'RE CLEAR?
YEAH, MY OFFER IS $260,000
FOR 33%,
TO MAKE US EQUAL PARTNERS,
THE THREE MUSKETEERS.
WE DON'T MIND
DOING THE HARD WORK.
THAT PERCENTAGE IS HIGHER THAN
WHAT WE'D WANT TO GIVE AWAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO...COUNTE--
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
JUST IN CASE --
JUST THINK ABOUT THIS,
ALL RIGHT?
IF YOU'RE WRONG
ON THE PRICING --
IN OTHER WORDS, IF THE MARKET
THAT REALLY CLEARS IS $9.99,
WHICH I THINK IT IS,
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA NEED
THIS GUY
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT
WITH A MISSTEPPED LAUNCH,
THE FIRST RETAILERS
THAT YOU PUT THE SKUs INTO
ARE GONNA HAVE SLOW SALES
AND DELIST YOU,
AND THEN
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETRACE
AND FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET THE MANUFACTURING COST
DOWN TO ABOUT A BUCK 35.
ON YOUR OWN,
THAT'S GONNA BE HARD,
AND SO IF HE'S WILLING TO DO IT,
I MEAN, IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT THAT DEAL,
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
ALVIN AND RAY
ARE SEEKING $260,000
FOR 10% OF THEIR CHILDREN'S
BATH TOY COMPANY, SoapSox.
DAYMOND HAS OFFERED
THE AMOUNT THEY ARE SEEKING,
BUT HE WANTS 33% OF THE COMPANY.
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT THAT DEAL,
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.
SUCK IT UP, TAKE THE PAIN.
YOU ASKED FOR TOO MUCH
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[CUBAN CHUCKLES]
ALL RIGHT?
YOU ASKED FOR TOO MUCH.
YOU WANTED $260,000, AND THOSE
ARE THE RULES OF "SHARK TANK" --
HE'S GOT TO GIVE YOU $260,000.
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY
FOR THAT MISTAKE.
YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT RIGHT NOW.
UM...
TH-- THE 33% IS --
IS STEEP, UH, FOR US
AND -- AND WHAT
WE'VE BEEN DOING.
WE KNOW YOU BRING
A LOT OF VALUE.
UH, YOU WERE
ONE OF THE SHARKS
THAT WE WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE
TO GET A DEAL WITH,
AND I'M HOPING WE CAN STILL
COME TO AGREEMENT
ON WHERE THAT NUMBER
REALLY LIES.
UM, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO...15%...FOR...
...$350,000?
OOH,
THEY ARE PROUD.
WOW.
THEY ARE PROUD.
MM-HMM.
I SHOULD WASH HIS MOUTH OUT
WITH SOAP
FOR THAT COUNTER.
HOLD ON.
YEAH. SO, GUYS...
...I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAY FIRM
ON THE 33%.
Greiner:
I HAVE A QUESTION.
YES.
Herjavec:
LORI AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING.
WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOU
$1 MILLION TO JUST BUY IT OUT?
WE [CHUCKLES]
WE AREN'T AFRAID
OF THE HARD WORK
AND BUILDING IT
TO SOMETHING BIGGER.
Uy: FOR US,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.
I'VE BEEN DESIGNING PRODUCTS
FOR BIGGER COMPANIES.
I-I KNOW I'M GOOD.
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WHERE I FEEL LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M FINALLY
DOING SOMETHING FOR MYSELF."
YEAH.
WE OWN THIS.
WE'RE DREAM CHASERS
RIGHT NOW,
SO WE DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT AWAY.
WE WANT A PARTNERSHIP,
BUT WE'RE DREAM CHASERS.
WE'RE CHASING
AFTER THE AMERICAN DREAM.
AND...YEAH.
Greiner: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GET THAT.
RAY, LORI AND I SAW
A LOT OF VALUE IN THE PRODUCT,
BUT I THINK...
HER AND I SEE
A POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT PATH.
SO, WE JUST THOUGHT,
WE'RE WILLING TO RISK $1 MILLION
TO TRY TO TAKE IT
DOWN THE PATH.
Greiner: YOU'RE INNOVATORS,
SO THIS, I DON'T THINK,
IS GOING TO BE
YOUR LAST PRODUCT.
Phillips: YEAH.
IT'S GOING TO BE
THE FIRST OF MANY.
O'Leary: GUYS, YOU GOT --
YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION.
YOU GOT A $1 MILLION OFFER,
OR YOU CAN PARTNER
WITH DAYMOND.
YOU GOT TO GIVE UP
A THIRD OF THE COMPANY.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE
BOTH OFFERS.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
John: GOODBYE.
GOODBYE.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
Phillips: THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THAT THEY DEVALUATED OUR PRODUCT
THAT MUCH.
Phillips: I DON'T THINK EVEN
IF THEY'D OFFERED US $5 MILLION
I THINK YOU GUYS GOT
AN INCREDIBLE DEAL.
THAT'S THE ONLY KIND
OF DEALS WE DO.
Corcoran: AND A FUN DEAL,
AS WELL.
WOW.
Narrator:
LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO NOW.
Hicks: LET'S WHIP IT INTO SHAPE,
MAN. WE GOT A LOT TO DO.
COME ON, DeVILLE.
BEING ON "SHARK TANK"
IMMEDIATELY LEGITIMIZED
OUR BUSINESS.
GOOD JOB.
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
OUR TOTAL SALES WERE $248,000.
SINCE BEING ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAVE 10,000 SQUARE FEET
OF SPACE,
AND WE'RE GONNA SURPASS
$2 MILLION IN SALES.
IT'S THE DETAILS, MAN.
IT'S THE DETAILS. YOU KNOW THAT.
WE'VE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING
ON OUR CORPORATE BIKE PROGRAM.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
WITH SOME HUGE BRANDS --
PepsiCo, MONSTER ENERGY.
WE'VE ALSO MADE BIKES
FOR THE BAND OneRepublic
STEP RIGHT UP!
COME ON, GUYS.
YOU'RE GONNA WIN A PRIZE
PLAYING SOME NINJA CARDS.
ALL RIGHT.
THE BUTCHER'S GONNA SHOW YOU
SOME TECHNIQUES.
Haton:
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
O'Leary: OKAY.
SO, THE FIRST TECHNIQUE
IS THE FRISBEE THROW.
VERY SIMPLE.
GO LIKE THAT.
GO FOR US.
SECOND THROW,
LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT,
IS THE TOMAHAWK.
SAME HOLD
AS THE FRISBEE THROW
ONLY YOU'RE GOING
VERTICAL MOTION.
GOT IT.
THE HARDEST TO MASTER,
BUT MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,
IS THE SIDEWINDER,
JUST LIKE THIS.
Berk:
AS AN ADDED INCENTIVE TODAY,
WE MADE A SPECIAL BOARD
FOR YOU GUYS.
OKAY.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
READY?
[LAUGHTER]
Berk: OKAY.
Herjavec: KEVIN.
NOW, THE GAME IS, WHOEVER HITS
THE MOST SHARKS WINS.
[LAUGHS]
Haton: THERE IT IS.
Berk: ONE.
WHOO!
YOU DIDN'T HIT --
YOU GOT TO HIT A --
YOU GOT TO FLING IT.
YOU GOT TO FLING IT.
OH!
OH, DOES THAT COUNT?
YEAH,
THAT DIDN'T GET ME.
I THINK THAT COUNTS.
Berk: ANYWHERE
ON THE SHARK COUNTS.
FLING IT. FLING IT.
YOU GOT TO FLING IT
IN THERE. OH!
OH, THERE IT IS.
OH, I GOT CUBAN.
THERE IT IS.
WINGED. YOU WINGED ME.
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
FLING IT.
YEAH, FLING IT.
[GROANS]
OOH. OH, THAT COUNTS.
THAT COUNTS.
OH.
OH, THAT --
THERE WE GO.
FLING IT FASTER.
A LITTLE BIT FASTER.
THERE YOU GO.
OH!
OH!
DEATH. YES.
OH, WE GOT A NATURAL.
OKAY, GUYS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE HAVE A CHAMPION.
Haton: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Herjavec: IT IS KIND OF FUN,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.
Greiner: SO, IS THAT, LIKE,
A REGULAR PLAYING CARD,
OR IS THAT THICKER,
OR...?
Berk: IT'S A NINJA CARD.
IT'S A SPECIAL CARD.
IT'S A NINJA CARD.
BUT IT IS A, UH,
THICK, PLASTIC CARD.
DO YOU HAVE TO BUY, UM,
A SPECIAL BOARD
IN WHICH TO USE WITH IT?
THIS IS THE GAME
THAT YOU BUY AT THE STORE.
OKAY. OKAY.
Herjavec: OH, I SEE.
THAT'S THE PACKAGING.
YEP. FOR NOW.
SO, IT'S --
IT'S A THICK STYROFOAM.
IT'S A THICK STYROFOAM.
CORRECT.
Herjavec:
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
WE SOLD -- WE MADE 100 UNITS,
AND WE SOLD THEM ALL.
A WHOLE 100 UNITS?
[CHUCKLES]
A WHOLE 100 UNITS.
WOW.
OVER WHAT PERIOD
OF TIME?
[LAUGHTER]
OUR SALES ARE
WHAT MR. WONDERFUL WOULD CALL
POO-POO.
YEAH.
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
WE LAUNCHED IN JULY 2012,
AND THEN WE SIGNED
AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT.
YES.
John: OH!
Cuban: TELL US MORE!
GRASSHOPPER,
TELL ME MORE.
John: OH!
Berk: YEAH, SO WE WENT
TO THE TOY SHOW,
AND IT HAPPENED TO BE
THE CHICAGO TOY FAIR.
AND WITHIN
THE FIRST HOUR,
WE GOT OFFERED
A LICENSE AGREEMENT.
THE DEAL WAS AN EXCLUSIVE,
SO THEY HAD THE WHOLE THING.
AND IT WAS 5%,
ESCALATED 1% PER YEAR.
OKAY, THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS.
WHERE'S THE BAD NEWS?
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.
THE BAD NEWS IS, THEY COULDN'T
SOURCE IT IN CHINA
SO THEY BAILED OUT
AFTER A YEAR.
WHAT?
Herjavec:
THEY COULDN'T SOURCE WHAT?
HOW COULD THEY NOT
SOURCE THIS?
IT'S STYROFOAM!
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
STYROFOAM.
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A --
IT'S A SPECIAL CRAFT FOAM.
DID YOU GET OUT OF THAT?
YES. YES.
YEAH, IT ENDED, UH --
THE RIGHTS
REVERTED BACK TO YOU?
THE RIGHTS REVERTED BACK TO US.
WE OWN 100%.
WE HAVE EVERYTHING BACK.
HOW LONG AGO
DID THEY REVERT BACK?
END OF --
IT WAS LAST YEAR.
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
ALL THIS TIME?
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE
TRYING TO GET OUR PRICES DOWN,
LOOKING FOR INVESTORS.
DID YOU GO
TO OTHER TOY COMPANIES
AND TRY TO DO
ANOTHER LICENSING DEAL?
NOT SINCE THEN, NO.
'CAUSE, UH,
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ANY.
"WE DON'T KNOW ANY"?
Cuban: YOU GUYS THOUGHT
YOU HAD IT EASY, RIGHT?
YOU WERE AN HOUR INTO
THE BUSINESS, AND YOU WERE SET.
WE WERE TOLD TO SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE RIDE.
YEAH.
AND YOU CERTAINLY --
NO, BUT HERE'S
THE PROBLEM --
YOU GOT A RIDE.
THAT'S FOR DANG SURE.
YOU GOT RUN OVER.
IF YOU GUYS HAD ORDERS
AND YOU DID THE TOY SHOW,
YOU NOW HAVE CONTACTS, RIGHT?
Berk: CORRECT. YES.
I'M SURE YOU TOOK A CARD
FROM EVERY SINGLE PERSON
THAT WAS INTERESTED...
ABSOLUTELY.
...ESPECIALLY RETAIL STORES.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK?
WE DO.
WE HAVE A LOT OF --
IT FALLS APART, YOU CALL THEM,
YOU SAY, "HEY, I'M A FREE AGENT.
I WANT TO SELL TO YOU."
THE PRODUCT
NEVER REACHED PRODUCTION.
GUYS, LOOK, I'M WILLING TO BE
A DISCIPLE OF THE NINJA WAY,
BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT
AS A FIT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
THE NINJA WOULD DO ANYTHING,
INCLUDING LAY HIS LIFE DOWN,
IN THE SERVICE
OF A GREATER GOOD.
YOU CAN'T EVEN
PICK UP A PHONE
AND MAKE A CALL
TO ANOTHER TOY COMPANY.
I'M NOT SEEING
ENOUGH HUSTLE.
I'M OUT.
WE NEED THE POWER OF SOMEONE
TO MAKE A PHONE CALL
TO HELP US CUT OUT
OUR MIDDLE MAN.
WE CAN'T GO
STRAIGHT TO...
THEY WON'T EVEN ANSWER
MY PHONE CALL.
OKAY.
I THINK IT'S CLEVER.
I THINK KIDS WILL LOVE IT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, THOUGH --
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HUSTLE,
YOU HAVE TO BE
AT LEAST THAT ENTERPRISING
IN WHICH TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO
AFTER A DISTRIBUTOR
LEAVES YOU IN THE LURCH.
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
I'M OUT.
WE'VE SEEN MANY,
MANY COMPANIES LIKE THIS.
I HAVE MANY FRIENDS
THAT HAVE GOTTEN
FINANCIALLY BUTCHERED
IN THE TOYS INDUSTRY.
I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER SEE MY MONEY BACK.
I CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE
AND FALL ON THE SWORD WITH YOU,
SO I'M OUT.
O'Leary: NINJAS,
THANK GOODNESS YOU'VE MET ME.
I, TOO, AM A NINJA --
SENSEI WONDERFUL, YOUR MASTER.
NOW, HERE'S WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO --
I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS
BEHIND THE DOJO...
[LAUGHTER]
...AND THROW A POISON DART
INTO IT.
WAIT TILL IT DIES,
AND RETURN
WHEN THE TASK IS DONE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND ONE MORE THING --
I'M OUT.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU, SHARKS.
[CUBAN CHUCKLES]
HAI.
NOW WE GOT TO DUCK.
Haton:
THE SHARKS CAME DOWN ON US
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PICK UP
THE PHONE,
BUT WE JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE OUR PRODUCT
WAS READY
TO GO TO MARKET YET.
AND NOW I THINK THAT, UH,
WE'LL BE READY
TO TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
AND GET THIS PRODUCT OUT THERE,
UH, EVEN WITHOUT THEM.
OOH!
NICE!
LOOK AT THAT.
I GOT THE CURVE GOING.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS INNOVATIVE,
NEW WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY.
YOU GUYS WANT
TO SEE THEM?
THEY'RE WORN ON THE BODY,
NOT IN THE --
IT'S NOT IN THE APPAREL.
RIGHT.
Greiner: OH, OKAY.
YOU CAN PUT IT
IN ANY CLOTHES.
OUR BASIC KIT
COMES WITH SIX SENSORS.
THERE'S FOUR DRUM PADS
THAT CAN GO IN YOUR CLOTHES,
AND WE ACTUALLY ALSO HAVE
TWO FOOT PEDALS
THAT GO IN YOUR SHOES
THAT GIVES YOU A KICK DRUM,
HIGH HAT,
EVEN A LOOP PEDAL
SO YOU CAN LOOP BEATS
AND, LIKE, MAKE COMPLETE SONGS
JUST WHEREVER YOU ARE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WE'RE TAKING PREORDERS
ON OUR WEBSITE RIGHT NOW.
O'Leary:
OH, SO YOU'RE PRE-REVENUE?
SO...
YES.
WHAT KIND OF DEMAND
ARE YOU GETTING?
HOW MANY UNITS
ARE PREORDERED?
SO, WE LAUNCHED WITH
OUR KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN.
REACHED
2 "X" OUR GOAL.
WHAT DID YOU RAISE?
$75,000.
John:
AND HOW MUCH PER UNIT?
OUR PRICE POINT STARTS AT $99,
AND IT GOES UP TO $229.
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THIS ACTUAL HARDWARE,
AND SO IT'S A BRAND?
HOW MANY UNITS CAN YOU SELL,
HOW MUCH CASH CAN I MAKE?
IS THAT THE RIGHT WAY
TO LOOK AT IT?
WELL, WE DO HAVE, UH,
SEVERAL PROVISIONAL PATENTS
THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON
TURNING INTO REAL PATENTS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS PATENTABLE?
YEAH.
SO, WHAT WE, UH, ARE PATENTING
IS RHYTHMIC GESTURES,
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY,
UH --
TAPPING
AND MULTIPLE TAPS
CONTROLLING DIFFERENT ASPECTS
OF YOUR DEVICE.
I'M JUST CURIOUS --
HOW BIG A MARKET
ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT
TO PLAY DRUMS ON THEIR BODY?
WELL, IF YOU SEE, LIKE,
THE ELECTRONIC MUSIC,
UH, YOU KNOW, SCENE
IS REALLY GROWING A LOT,
AND A LOT OF THE MUSICIANS
ARE TRYING TO GET AWAY
FROM JUST SITTING BEHIND
THEIR LAPTOPS.
YOU SEE THEM PLAYING THIS HUGE
CONCERT FOR ALL THESE PEOPLE,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE CHECKING THEIR E-MAIL.
TO GIVE YOU A $3 MILLION
VALUATION ON DRUMPANTS,
I-I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE
WAS GONNA SEE THAT VISION.
SO, WE REALLY NEED
TO UNDERSTAND
YOU JUST TAP YOUR PANTS
TO BUY IT RIGHT THERE.
COME ON. THAT IS THE DUMBEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU GUYS
GOT TOGETHER AND CAME HERE
TO BE
IN THE GLOW-STICK MARKET.
GUYS,
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW.
CAN WE, UH,
CONFER IN THE HALLWAY?
YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS IN "SHARK TANK"
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK --
NASTY, NASTY THINGS.
WHAT IS WRONG?
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
GUYS, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
RIGHT NOW.
CAN WE, UH,
CONFER IN THE HALLWAY?
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
IN "SHARK TANK"
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK --
NASTY, NASTY THINGS.
WHAT IS WRONG?
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
THANK YOU.
NASTY THINGS.
WELL,
I LIKE DAYMOND'S OFFER
'CAUSE IT'S MORE MONEY
AND HE'S GONNA HELP US
WITH THE LICENSING.
YEAH,
BUT <i>WE</i> UNDERSTAND IT.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP US,
LIKE, DEVELOP
OUR NEXT-GENERATION PRODUCT.
AND --
OKAY, BUT...
LIKE,
DAYMOND'S OFFERING
ALMOST TWICE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
FOR THE SAME PERCENTAGE.
BUT YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
A FORCEFUL WAY TO GET THERE.
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU COULD REALLY ACCEPT
A FORCEFUL WAY
TO GET THERE.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
I WAS THE FIRST GUY
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I THOUGHT I MADE YOU
A FAIR OFFER.
THEN YOU LISTENED
TO DAYMOND'S OFFER,
WHICH IS VERY RESPECTFUL,
AND AT THE VERY END OF IT ALL,
I REITERATED MY OFFER,
BYE. YOU GUYS GOT TO GO.
SORRY.
...WHERE THE SHARKS
STAND --
WOULD -- WOULD IT
BE POSSIBLE FOR US...
Cuban: GOOD LUCK. BYE.
GUYS, IT'S TOO LATE.
...TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER?
LET SOMEONE ELSE
HAVE A CHANCE.
LIFE DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
WELL, SHOULD HAVE GONE
WITH DAYMOND.
TOLD YOU.
INCREDIBLE.
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.
NOW, THAT WAS
THE FIRST DATE.
IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
AFTER THAT.
I GUARANTEE YOU
THIS HAPPENS TO THEM
EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
I CAN IMAGINE THEM
TRYING TO PICK OUT LUNCH.
WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING
ABOUT THEM? THEY'RE GONE!
THEY'RE DEAD.
THEY'RE GONE.
