AND EVEN STEVEN TYLER
OF AEROSMITH.
OO-HOO!
OH, HEY, BARB.
HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD. I'M IN DALLAS
FOR A MEETING.
I HAD TO STOP BY.
AH.
WORKING WITH BARBARA AND MARK
HAS BEEN AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.
BARBARA'S A MARKETING EXPERT,
AND SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE
ROLE MODEL.
WOW.
THIS HAS
YOUR NAME ON IT, BARB.
I AM BLOWN AWAY AT WHAT
FLEETWOOD HAS BUILT HERE.
LAST TIME I WAS HERE, THIS SPACE
WAS ONE THIRD THE SIZE,
WE WERE DOING
1/3 THE BIKE SALES,
AND THAT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO.
OKAY, ENOUGH OF THIS.
LET'S GO ON A BIKE RIDE.
COME ON.
LET'S DO IT.
Hicks: I CAN HONESTLY SAY
"SHARK TANK" HAS BEEN
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE
ADVENTURES OF MY LIFE.
MARK AND BARBARA SAW
THE POTENTIAL IN VILLY CUSTOMS.
NOW I GET TO DO WHAT I LOVE
EVERY DAY.
[ALL CHEER]
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A PRODUCT DESIGNED TO CARRY
ONE'S MOST VALUABLE POSSESSIONS.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ANASTASIA BALYURA.
I AM SEEKING $25,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
MY BABY TRIXIE
LOVES TO BE HELD 24/7.
TRIXIE EVEN ATTENDED LAW SCHOOL
WITH ME.
IN FACT,
TRIXIE IS HERE WITH ME NOW.
Herjavec: OH!
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]
ANASTASIA,
I HAVE A CHIHUAHUA,
Balyura: LORI, THIS IS
GONNA LOOK AWESOME ON YOU.
NOT A LONG-HAIRED ONE.
EXACT SAME COLORS.
30% OF CUSTOMERS ARE MEN.
YOU LOVE THIS, YEAH.
John: REALLY?
IT-- IT'S MY DAUGHTERS'.
LET'S JUST GET THAT STRAIGHT
RIGHT NOW.
OH, GREAT, GREAT.
WELL, YOUR DAUGHTER WOULD LOOK
SO AMAZING IN THIS.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
Greiner: SO, HAVE YOU
BEEN SELLING THESE?
I HAVE, YES.
I ACTUALLY AM A BIT
OF AN ENTREPRENEUR ON ACCIDENT
[CHUCKLES] UM, BECAUSE I WAS IN
MY FINAL SEMESTER OF LAW SCHOOL,
AND THOSE LAW BOOKS,
THEY'RE HUGE.
SO, IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH
TO HOLD HER AND THE BOOKS.
AND SHE LOVES TO BE HELD.
YOU BROUGHT TRIXIE
THROUGH AN HOUR AND A HALF?
TO LAW SCHOOL.
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
AND TRIXIE LOVES TO BE HELD.
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE ZIPPED UP
OFF TO THE SIDE
IN SOME BAG
THAT'S FALLING OFF MY SHOULDER.
ARE YOU A LAWYER NOW?
UM, ACTUALLY,
I STARTED THIS COMPANY
MY LAST SEMESTER OF LAW SCHOOL,
AND WHEN I INVENTED THIS,
I STARTED BRINGING HER
TO LAW SCHOOL LIKE THIS.
AND MY PATENT LAW PROFESSOR
SAID,
"THE LAWS ARE CHANGING
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH,
"SO IF YOU POST THIS ONLINE
RIGHT NOW,
YOU'LL ACTUALLY HAVE
COMMON-LAW PATENT PROTECTION."
YEAH, SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN SELLING IT,
AND HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD
THIS YEAR?
YEAH, UM, SO I STARTED, UH,
IN JULY OF 2013,
SO I'VE BEEN
FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW.
AND, UH, I HAVE SOLD, UH,
ABOUT 980 UNITS, UH --
AT WHAT PRICE?
UH, THEY'RE $138 EACH.
WHAT?!
$138 EACH?
YEAH, BECAUSE
THEY'RE A FASHION ACCESSORY.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S TYLER FREEMAN.
AND I'M LEI YU.
AND OUR COMPANY IS DRUMPANTS.
WE'RE OFFERING $150,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 5% OF OUR COMPANY.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON FOR YEARS,
AND WITH THE HELP
OF OUR PHENOMENAL TEAM,
IT'S FINALLY READY.
DRUMROLL, PLEASE.
[DRUMROLL]
[ELECTRONIC DRUM BEATS PLAY]
["SHARK TANK"
THEME SONG PLAYS]
[LAUGHTER]
SO, THIS IS DRUMPANTS,
WHICH,
AS YOU JUST SAW,
LETS YOU PLAY MUSIC
WHEREVER YOU ARE
WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.
[RIM SHOT]
[LAUGHTER]
DRUMPANTS ARE A WEARABLE
CONTROLLER PLATFORM.
YOU CAN WEAR IT IN ANY CLOTHES,
NOT JUST YOUR PANTS,
AND YOU CAN ALSO USE IT
FOR MORE THAN JUST MUSIC.
YOU CAN CONTROL APPS, GAMES,
UM, AND WEBSITES.
TOGETHER,
WE CAN CHANGE
HOW PEOPLE INTERACT
WITH THEIR DEVICES
AND HELP SHAPE THE FUTURE
OF WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY.
SO, SHARKS, JOIN US.
IT'S TIME TO MARCH TO THE BEAT
OF A DIFFERENT DRUM...PANTS.
[ELECTRONIC NOTE PLAYS]
[LAUGHTER]
John: BA-BAM.
THAT'S PRETTY WILD.
SO, YOU'RE USING WHAT
AS THE INTERFACE,
USING BLUETOOTH BACK TO A PHONE
THAT'S SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
WE'RE USING BLUETOOTH.
YOU CAN CONNECT
TO ANY DEVICE.
WE HAVE THESE WEARABLE SENSORS.
THEY'RE SOFT.
YOU CAN PUT THEM
IN ANY CLOTHES.
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE,
TYLER?
YEAH,
WE GOT SOME RIGHT HERE.
W-WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
TOMORROW.
Yu: RIGHT.
O'Leary:
DON'T GIVE ME THE CRAP
ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD'S
GONNA LOOK LIKE IN 10 YEARS.
I WANT TO KNOW
HOW MUCH MONEY I CAN MAKE TODAY.
TO DATE,
WE HAVE SOLD 720 UNITS.
WE ARE FORECASTED TO SELL
AN ADDITIONAL 4,000
BASED ON HOLIDAY SALES.
BASED ON OUR NET PROFIT MARGIN
OF 45%,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
$220,000 WORTH OF PROFIT
AT THE END
OF THIS YEAR ALONE.
WHEN I LOOK AT A PRODUCT,
I JUST LOOK AT SOME BASIC,
SIMPLE THINGS --
CAN I SELL
MILLIONS OF THESE?
DOES IT HAVE
A BROAD ENOUGH MARKET?
GREAT IDEA, BUT, UM, FOR ME,
IT'S JUST TOO NICHE OF A MARKET.
AND SO,
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
JUST IMAGINE
YOU'RE WATCHING QVC,
YOU SEE A PRODUCT
YOU LIKE,
Yu:
BUT WHAT TYLER'S DESCRIBING
IS OUR NEXT-GENERATION
FUTURE PRODUCT.
WHAT WE'RE SELLING TODAY
THAT GIVES US
OUR $3 MILLION VALUATION
IS DRUMPANTS BY ITSELF.
HOW LARGE
THIS LITTLE NICHE IS --
IS VERTICAL, DON'T KNOW.
SOME OF THE OTHER IDEAS YOU HAD
ARE INTERESTING,
BUT YOU HAVE
TONS OF COMPETITION.
SO, WOULD I PAY
$3 MILLION FOR THIS?
NO.
THAT'S A HUGE STRETCH
UNTIL YOU PROVE IT TO ME.
YOU KNOW, WHAT I LOVE ABOUT ME
IS, I CARE ABOUT THE CASH.
CASH.
[CHUCKLES]
AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A HARD TIME GETTING IT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Herjavec: SO, HERE --
HERE'S WHERE I'M AT --
GOT TO BE HONEST,
NOT THAT INTERESTED
IN THE DRUMPANTS.
I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT THAT MARKET
'CAUSE I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT THE NEXT MARKET.
IT'S A BIT OF A FLYER
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
OF THESE YOU'RE GONNA SELL,
BUT I THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.
I MEAN, I THINK
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS.
WE DID ALMOST $4 MILLION
FOR THE ChordBuddy,
AND THAT'S
A VERY LOW-TECH PRODUCT.
UM, I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 20%.
BOO-YAH.
RESPECTFULLY,
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO --
TO LISTEN TO WHAT MARK HAS --
IF HE'S...
THAT'S A GOOD --
THAT'S A GOOD OFFER.
WHAT IF MARK
HAS NOTHING TO SAY?
Yu: WELL, THEN...
YOU MAY LOSE THAT.
ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN LICENSING THE TECHNOLOGY?
DEFINITELY.
IF IT'S JUST PURELY
A LICENSING PLAY,
AND I WOULD OFFER YOU
$250,000 FOR 20%.
THE LICENSING DEAL
IS A GREAT DEAL,
BUT YOU'RE ONLY GETTING MONEY
IF THE STUFF SELLS.
Yu: RIGHT.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY --
John:
NO, NO. OH, NO. INCORRECT.
SO -- SO THEN, MY QUESTION --
SEE, THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE
BECAUSE LICENSES
ARE UP-FRONT CASH
AND GUARANTEED MINIMUMS.
HERE'S THE WAY IT GOES,
ALL RIGHT?
SO, YOU GO TO A -- A PERSON
WHO MAKES THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT.
YOU SAY,
"HEY, WE HAVE THIS DEVICE.
WHAT CAN YOU DO?"
AND THEY GO,
"WE SERVICE ALL THE GLOW STICKS
"FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD.
"WE WANT TO ADD THIS
INTO OUR CATALOGUE.
WE WILL GUARANTEE YOU AT LEAST
$1 MILLION OF SALES AT 10%."
SO, YOU'VE GUARANTEED
AT THAT POINT
THAT YOU'LL GET
$100,000 PER YEAR.
I SEE THIS AS A PROFITABLE
PROOF OF CONCEPT.
IT'S THE BIGGER MARKET
I WANT TO BE IN,
TYLER AND LEI
HAVE OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FROM BOTH ROBERT AND DAYMOND
FOR THEIR WEARABLE CONTROLLER
DEVICE, DRUMPANTS.
LEI,
I'M GETTING OLD HERE!
LET'S JUST GO.
I REALLY DON'T.
I THINK IT WILL.
HE KNOWS ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT WE WANT TO TALK TO.
[DRUMROLL]
Herjavec:
LET'S GET A DRUMROLL, KEVIN.
Greiner: THEY'RE GONNA SAY,
"I TAKE NO OFFER."
[CHUCKLES]
O'Leary: SO, LET'S JUST
SUMMARIZE WHERE WE'RE AT.
ROBERT HAS OFFERED YOU $150,000
FOR 20%,
LIKES WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
DOESN'T CARE
HOW YOU GET REVENUE.
DAYMOND'S MORE SPECIFIC.
HE'S WILLING TO OFFER
MORE MONEY --
$250,000 FOR 20%
WITH A DISTINCT DIRECTION
IN LICENSING.
WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED TO DO?
ROBERT, IF YOU WOULD DO
15% FOR $150,000...
SO, YOU'RE COUNTERING ROBERT?
AND YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN DAYMOND'S OFFER.
HOLD ON.
IS THAT CORRECT?
WELL, NO, NO.
WELL, ARE YOU?
SO, WE'RE GONNA GO --
I THINK WE WOULD LIKE...
WELL, IDEALLY,
WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE A --
IT WOULD -- IT WOULD BE NICE
TO HAVE A DEAL
BETWEEN ALL OF THE SHARKS.
UH, YOU KNOW, ONE THING
ABOUT BEING IN THE TANK IS,
I LOVE PEOPLE
TO BE DECISIVE.
SO, I'M OUT.
SO, NOW IT'S ON YOU, ROB.
I'M GONNA STICK AT THE 20%.
MARK, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO ADD?
I THINK
W-WHAT YOUR CHALLENGE IS --
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THIS
YOUR ENTIRE LIVES --
IS YOU'RE BOTH
VERY DELIBERATE.
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
THEY CAN'T MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
BUT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM,
RIGHT?
SOMETIMES, THE PERF--
THE PERFECT IS THE ENEMY
OF THE GOOD, RIGHT?
PARALYSIS VIA ANALYSIS.
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS LISTENING.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO GET A SENSE OF
'CAUSE I LIKE THE PRODUCT,
TYLER LOOKED AT ME
FOR A MOMENT
AND THEN LOOKED OVER
AT MARK.
WE'RE DEFINITELY INTERESTED
IN YOUR OFFER, BUT --
I'M OUT.
I TOLD YOU NASTY THINGS CAN
HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TANK.
SO, TO -- I GUESS THE REASON
TO EXPLAIN WHY WE --
WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW.
YOU GOT --
YOU HAVE NOBODY LEFT.
WHY WE WANTED TO WAIT
TO SEE...
WE'RE GOOD. THAT'S IT.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE EXAMPLE
OF TWO ENTREPRENEURS
THAT WERE INCAPABLE
OF MAKING A DECISION.
LEI, YOU KNOW WHY --
LEI, YOU KNOW WHY --
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE INCAPABLE
OF MAKING A DECISION.
LEI, IT DOESN'T --
NO, LOOK,
YOU CAN'T MAKE A DECISION.
THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.
WE CAN'T DO THAT
ON $150,000 --
I FORBID YOU
TO SPEAK ANYMORE.
NO, WE --
YOU KNOW, WE GET THAT.
PLEASE LEAVE.
$150,000, GONE.
$250,000, VAPORIZED.
NOW YOU'RE VAPORIZED.
GET OUT OF HERE.
BUT -- BUT --
NO BUTS.
BUT NOW
THAT WE UNDERSTAND...
GONE. GONE.
