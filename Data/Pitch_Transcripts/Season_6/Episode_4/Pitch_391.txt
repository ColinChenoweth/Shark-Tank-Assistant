NOAH HAS BEEN
MY ACTIVITY BUDDY
SINCE HE WAS PROBABLY
2 YEARS OLD.
Brian: WHEN NOAH WAS BORN,
I WAS GETTING MY MBA,
BUT HAVING A YOUNG KID,
I FELT LIKE
I HAD TO TAKE THE SECURE PATH.
NOW THAT NOAH'S OLDER,
IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD TIME
I'VE TAKEN NOAH
AS FAR AS I CAN.
WHAT WE NEED
IS AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SHARK
THAT CAN SHOW HIM WHAT TO DO
TO GET HIS BUSINESS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS NOAH,
NOAH'S BROUGHT IN
SOME SAMPLES OF HIS PRODUCT
SO HE COULD
SHARE IT WITH YOU
MILO WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE A FRIEND UP HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN'T BUY THE WHOLE KIT,
HUH?
WE DON'T SELL THE KITS,
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY
OUR DIFFERENTIATOR.
Greiner: YOU FIT!
[ IMITATES ENGINE REVVING ]
THERE WE GO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S COOL.
YEAH. IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
THANKS, BUD.
BYE, MILO.
BYE.
SEE YA, MILO.
BYE.
HE'S FLYING OUT.
HOW HARD IS IT
TO TAKE A NORMAL BOX
Brian:
AS LORI POINTED OUT,
THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE THERE
TO DO A VERY SIMPLE BOX.
I KNOW THESE ARE PAINTED,
BUT WE PREFER THAT THE
KIDS JUST HAVE THE FUN
PLAYING IN THE BOX.
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES US DIFFERENT.
DID YOU
INVESTIGATE THE MODEL
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY CREATED
A PRE-CUT BOX?
BECAUSE IT STILL MAKES IT A LOT
EASIER FOR ME AS A CONSUMER.
AS A DAD,
I-IT'S MUCH MORE WORK.
BUT THAT'S WHAT <i>NICE</i> DADS
DO WITH CHILDREN.
Corcoran:
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, YOU KNOW.
Cuban: BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT SMART DADS DO?
SMART DADS DON'T SET
A HIGH EXPECTATION
THAT THEY CAN'T FULFILL,
RIGHT?
AFTER SEEING THIS,
THERE'S NO CHANCE
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT
FOR MY SON JAKE.
Brian: THE VERY FIRST
RETAIL STORE WE WENT INTO --
IT WAS A LOCAL TOY STORE,
INDEPENDENT TOY STORY --
THEY SELL
THOSE TYPES OF KITS.
WHEN WE PUT OUR PRODUCT
OUT THERE,
WE EASILY SOLD 30 OR 40
TO 1 OF WHAT THEY SOLD.
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
UM, WELL, WE STARTED THIS
COMPANY EIGHT MONTHS AGO,
I -- WHEN NOAH WAS BORN,
I WAS GETTING MY MBA.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR.
BUT WHEN I BROUGHT HOME
THAT LITTLE GUY, UM...
YOU KNOW, I-IT'S A FEELING
OF RESPONSIBILITY,
THAT YOU HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL.
THAT'S HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS.
WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN, NOAH?
I'M IN 8th GRADE.
IT'S TIME.
SO WHAT? YOU MISS A FEW GRADES.
NOT A PROBLEM.
WELL, UM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR OFFER, KEVIN.
WE'RE SUPER GRATEFUL
FOR YOU
YOU'LL PAY FOR YOUR COLLEGE
IF THIS WORKS, NOAH.
BRIAN, NOAH, KEVIN'S IDEAS --
ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER,
OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
KEVIN'S IDEAS ARE WONDERFUL, BUT
WE'RE A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM IT.
LET'S GO, ROBERT.
WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.
Greiner:
YEAH, ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER?
I'M GONNA MAKE
THE SAME OFFER.
I'M GONNA MAKE
THE SAME OFFER AS KEVIN.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $35,000
FOR 50%.
Corcoran:
UM, HERE'S MY THINKING.
UM, YOU REMIND ME, OF COURSE,
OF RYAN FROM RYAN'S BARKERY.
NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION,
NOAH. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
UM, WELL [CHUCKLES]
UH [CHUCKLES]
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION,
NOAH. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
UH [CHUCKLES]
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TOUGH.
BELIEVE ME, LIFE COULD --
LIFE COULD BE WORSE.
SOME OF
THE HARDEST MOMENTS.
VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT COME
IN THE SHARK TANK AT <i>ANY</i> AGE
GET THREE OFFERS LIKE THIS.
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
OR DO YOU HAVE ANY COUNTERS?
SO, WE'D BE CRAZY
NOT TO TRY
TO STEAL A LITTLE INFORMATION
OR KNOWLEDGE FROM YOU.
YOU'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT
THE BOXES.
Corcoran: LET ME --
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT'S CHALLENGING FOR US --
LET ME SUGGEST
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.
YOU HAVE THREE ROCK-SOLID OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE
AWAY FROM THE CLOSE,
YOU WANT TO MOVE TOWARD IT.
SO, ALL I CAN SAY...
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE THE C.E.O.
YOU KNOW, THE DECISION'S
ULTIMATELY YOURS.
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT'S A TOUGH ONE,
BUT WHAT A WONDERFUL PROBLEM.
DON'T SCREW IT UP.
UM...
[ Chuckling ] I DON'T KNOW.
THESE ARE ALL
REALLY GOOD OPTIONS.
SO [CHUCKLES]
WHICH ONE?
WHO DO YOU THINK
WOULD BE THE BEST MENTOR?
UM [CHUCKLES]
WELL...
I THINK THESE ARE ALL
REALLY GOOD OFFERS.
YOU GUYS ALL BRING A LOT
TO THE TABLE FOR ME.
UM...
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT...
UM, MR. WONDERFUL, KEVIN, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO DO AN OFFER WITH US?
OH!
WHAT?
WHOO-HOO!
UNBELIEVABLE.
Cuban: YAY! THAT'S A FIRST!
Herjavec: YEAH!
CONGRATULATIONS, NOAH.
HE LOOKS UP TO HIM, OBVIOUSLY.
THIS IS GONNA BE A WILD RIDE.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
I'M SHOCKED.
GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
TAKE CARE.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
WHY'D YOU PICK KEVIN? YOU GOT
TO TELL ME. THIS IS AMAZING.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, 'CAUSE HIS
WAS THE WORST OFFER IN TERMS
OF EQUITY, IN TERMS OF CASH.
Brian:
GIRLS, HOW ARE WE DOING?
WE GOT A LOT OF ORDERS
TO FILL.
BEFORE WE CAME ON
"SHARK TANK,"
WE'D ONLY DONE
ABOUT $4,000 IN SALES.
SINCE AIRING ON "SHARK TANK"
EIGHT MONTHS AGO,
WE'VE DONE OVER $900,000
IN SALES.
WE DESPERATELY NEED TO GET OUT
OF THE GARAGE
Brian:
AS OUR BUSINESS HAS GROWN,
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
MY DAUGHTERS HAS ALSO GROWN.
IT'S SUCH A THRILL TO BE ABLE
TO WORK WITH MY TWO GIRLS.
THIS IS SOMETHING
WE'LL CHERISH FOREVER.
