IT'S AN AMERICAN DREAM
COME TRUE.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A SOLUTION
TO A COMMON PROBLEM
ENCOUNTERED WHILE DINING OUT.
FROM ALL OVER NORTH AMERICA,
UNITED KINGDOM, JAPAN,
GUAM --
NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE THAT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF YOU'D LIKE, I'VE GOT SOME
HERE I CAN PASS OUT TO YOU.
Cuban: PLEASE DO.
Herjavec: SURE.
[ LAUGHING ]
OR WAS BECAUSE YOU BENDING OVER?
NO, I HAD A NICE BUTT.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
"WHOOPS!"
BUT IF NOT
FOR THAT LITTLE GIMMICK,
I COULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN
THE $1,000.
I COULD'VE NEVER BUILT
MY BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS.
NONE OF THAT
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.
IN PRINCIPLE,
I CAN'T GO IN.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M OUT.
IT'S REALLY CLEVER.
IT REALLY WORKS, BUT JUST ON
ONE TYPE OF TABLE.
YOU'VE GONE
KNOCKING ON DOORS,
BUT IN ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT BIG OF SALES.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS BEN KUSIN.
BEN'S GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW EASY IT IS
TO REVIVE YOUR SHIRT
WITH REVIVER.
YEAH. SO, I JUST, RIGHT HERE,
SLIDE IT ONTO MY FINGERS,
SWIPE GENTLY
THE WHITE LAYER
Ben: SO NOW, SHARKS, WE'D LIKE
YOU TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES
WHAT THIS REVOLUTIONARY
TECHNOLOGY IS ALL ABOUT.
Eric: IT ACTUALLY WAS
ONE OF THOSE PRODUCTS
THAT WAS GENUINELY
BORN OUT OF NEED.
I HAD, UH,
HAD A CIGARETTE,
ON THE BOOKS,
THIS IS EARNEST CAPITAL.
ERIC, HANG ON.
Eric: IT REALLY SUSTAINS.
THEY TESTED THE CLOTHES
AN HOUR LATER -- NO PROBLEM.
SO, OUT OF THE $500,000,
IS IT ALL PETCO?
NO.
NO.
SO, PETCO'S ALMOST HALF
OF OUR BUSINESS SO FAR.
HOW MANY LOCATIONS?
ALL OF THEM.
UH, 1,200
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Greiner: BEN,
LET ME ASK A QUESTION.
DO YOU AGREE
THAT 20 BUCKS A MONTH
IS -- IS LIKE RAT POOP
TO A BUYER?
HE WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
NOT AT SCALE. NOT AT ALL.
THAT'S NOT -- SO --
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
TO GETTING DE-LISTED THERE.
YOU NEED MUCH MORE IN SALES
TO JUSTIFY
A $3 MILLION VALUATION.
THAT IS THE REASON I'M OUT. I
DON'T CARE ABOUT THE REST OF IT.
WOW.
I FEEL VERY BADLY
SAYING THIS TO YOU,
BUT I,
AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,
DON'T INVEST
IN RICH KIDS' BUSINESSES.
NOW, THIS IS SAD, BECAUSE
IT'S A PREJUDICE FOR YOU.
COMING FROM MY BACKGROUND,
THE BEST PRIVILEGE I HAD
WAS I HAD 1,000 BUCKS
TO TRY TO MAKE A RUN WITH
Ben:
THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME.
GOOD LUCK.
TO BE RICH KIDS,
YOU HAVE TO BE RICH.
WE'RE NOT RICH,
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
THAT'S AN UNFAIR
CHARACTERIZATION
OF HOW THEY MADE IT OUT TO BE
BECAUSE OF OUR FATHER'S SUCCESS.
NOW, <i>WILL</i> WE BE RICH?
I THINK WITH LORI ON BOARD,
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
BUT UNTIL THEN, I'D HOLD OFF
ON CALLING US RICH KIDS.
