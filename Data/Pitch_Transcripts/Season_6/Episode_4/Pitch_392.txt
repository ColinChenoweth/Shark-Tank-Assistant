AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
FIRST INTO THE TANK
ARE MOTHER-AND-SON ENTREPRENEURS
WITH A NEW TWIST
ON A WEDDING TRADITION.
IT'S AN AMERICAN DREAM
COME TRUE.
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A SOLUTION
TO A COMMON PROBLEM
ENCOUNTERED WHILE DINING OUT.
FROM ALL OVER NORTH AMERICA,
UNITED KINGDOM, JAPAN,
GUAM --
NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE THAT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF YOU'D LIKE, I'VE GOT SOME
HERE I CAN PASS OUT TO YOU.
Cuban: PLEASE DO.
Herjavec: SURE.
[ LAUGHING ]
I WOULD PRETEND THE TABLE
WAS A PROBLEM AND BEND ON OVER.
OH, YOU WOULD
HIT ON THE CUSTOMERS?
NO, LET ME TELL YOU,
MY TIPS WERE THROUGH THE ROOF.
I JUST WOULDN'T --
NOW, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE TABLE
OR WAS BECAUSE YOU BENDING OVER?
NO, I HAD A NICE BUTT.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
"WHOOPS!"
BUT IF NOT
FOR THAT LITTLE GIMMICK,
I COULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN
THE $1,000.
I COULD'VE NEVER BUILT
MY BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS.
NONE OF THAT
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.
IN PRINCIPLE,
I CAN'T GO IN.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M OUT.
IT'S REALLY CLEVER.
IT REALLY WORKS, BUT JUST ON
ONE TYPE OF TABLE.
YOU'VE GONE
KNOCKING ON DOORS,
BUT IN ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT BIG OF SALES.
MM-HMM.
AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE
BECAUSE YOU CREATED
SOMETHING VERY CLEVER
FOR A PROBLEM
THAT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE
WHERE THEY WANT
TO PAY FOR IT.
MM-HMM.
I DON'T SEE A BIG MARKET FOR IT.
I'M OUT.
GREAT INVENTION.
IT OBVIOUSLY, CERTAINLY WORKS.
IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG, LONG JOURNEY
TO GET IT INTO
A LOT OF RESTAURANTS
WHERE <i>YOU</i> CAN MAKE MONEY,
AND THEN I, AS AN INVESTOR,
CAN MAKE MONEY. I...
MM-HMM.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE.
I WORKED IN A RESTAURANT.
I SAID I WOULD NEVER GO
BACK THERE IN ANY WAY. I'M OUT.
OKAY.
SO, MARK, YOU'RE THE LAST SHARK
THAT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY.
I'M THE LAST SHARK?
OH, MAN!
AND YOU'RE FROM TEXAS.
THROW THIS GUY A BONE.
GIVE HIM $100,000, PLEASE.
I BEG YOU.
I'M SO CLOSE TO
GETTING OVER THE HILL ON THIS,
'CAUSE ONCE WE GET -- WE'VE
GOTTEN SOME OF THE BIG PEOPLE.
I NEED TO GET PAST
THAT GATEKEEPER
AND WHERE THEY CAN SEE THEM.
'CAUSE THEM PEOPLE
SITTING UP IN THAT OFFICE --
THEY DON'T KNOW
THAT THEY HAVE
WOBBLY TABLES
IN THE RESTAURANTS.
THEY'RE SO BUSY
DOING OTHER THINGS.
TO GET THIS THING TO GOING,
IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE THAT MUCH.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS BEN KUSIN.
AND I'M HIS BROTHER,
ERIC KUSIN.
OUR COMPANY'S NAME'S
REVIVER,
AND WE'RE ASKING
FOR $150,000
FOR A 5% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
THE SNIFF TEST --
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
THIS THING --
[ BOTH SNIFF ]
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
SMOKE, SWEAT, FOOD ODORS
CAN LEAVE YOUR CLOTHES
SMELLING -- WELL, NOT SO FRESH.
AND WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU FAIL THE SNIFF TEST?
YOU'RE LEFT
WITH NO OTHER OPTION
OTHER THAN TO RUN HOME
AND CHANGE CLOTHES
OR JUST LIVE
WITH YOUR STINKY SELF.
[ CHUCKLES ]
UNTIL NOW.
INTRODUCING REVIVER
CLOTHING SWIPES,
THE GROUNDBREAKING
INVENTION
FOR INSTANT AND ON-THE-GO
CLOTHING FRESHNESS.
OUR REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY
ALLOWS YOU TO SWIPE
A DRY LAYER OF ODOR-FIGHTING
FORMULATION ONTO YOUR OUTFIT
TO KEEP YOU FRESH
BETWEEN WASHES.
THINK OF REVIVER AS BREATH
MINTS, BUT FOR YOUR CLOTHES.
NOW WE'RE READY
TO BRING REVIVER TO THE WORLD.
WHICH ONE OF YOU
WANTS TO JOIN US
IN THE FRESHNESS
REVOLUTION?
SO, WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
TO SHOW YOU HOW REVIVER WORKS.
LORI, IF YOU DON'T MIND COMING
UP FOR A QUICK DEMONSTRATION.
A LOT OF US
ARE EATING ON THE RUN NOWADAYS,
LEAVING OUR CLOTHES SMELLING
A LOT LIKE WHAT WE JUST ATE.
TO IMITATE THAT, WE'VE BEEN
LETTING THIS SHIRT MARINATE
IN SOME BURGERS AND FRIES
AND SOME OTHER FRIED FOOD.
YOU CAN GUARANTEE
IT DOESN'T PASS THE SNIFF TEST.
EWW! WHOA.
YEAH.
INSTEAD OF
HAVING TO RUN HOME
AND, FRANKLY,
JUST BURN THAT SHIRT,
BEN'S GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW EASY IT IS
TO REVIVE YOUR SHIRT
WITH REVIVER.
YEAH. SO, I JUST, RIGHT HERE,
SLIDE IT ONTO MY FINGERS,
SWIPE GENTLY
THE WHITE LAYER
AGAINST MY CLOTHES
AND EVEN MY HAIR --
IT ACTUALLY
HELPS FRESHEN YOUR HAIR.
SO, IF YOU NOTICE,
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS,
IT'S A CLEAR LAYER
OF ODOR-FIGHTING FORMULATION.
SO, IF YOU
JUST WANT TO SMELL...
MM-HMM.
JUST LIKE THAT.
AND IT'S REUSABLE.
LORI, DID IT WORK?
IS IT BETTER?
IT <i>IS</i> BETTER.
Ben: SO NOW, SHARKS, WE'D LIKE
YOU TO SEE FOR YOURSELVES
WHAT THIS REVOLUTIONARY
TECHNOLOGY IS ALL ABOUT.
SO, ERIC, IF YOU COULD
HAND OUT SOME SWIPES.
EXAMPLE OF
SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS HERE,
IF YOU JUST WANT TO
GRAB ONE OF THOSE.
THANKS SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE YOUR HELP, LORI.
SORRY TO PUT YOU THROUGH THAT.
NO, IT WAS GOOD. I LIKED IT.
MR. WONDERFUL.
Herjavec: HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THE IDEA?
Eric: IT ACTUALLY WAS
ONE OF THOSE PRODUCTS
THAT WAS GENUINELY
BORN OUT OF NEED.
I HAD, UH,
HAD A CIGARETTE,
AND I WAS GOING BACK INTO WORK
FOR A REALLY IMPORTANT MEETING,
AND I REALIZED
THAT MY CLOTHES SMELLED.
SO I WENT
TO A CONVENIENCE STORE,
AND I NOTICED THERE WAS
A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR MY MOUTH.
THERE WAS BREATH MINTS,
BREATH STRIPS,
BREATH SPRAY,
THERE WAS GUM.
BUT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
FOR MY CLOTHES.
AND IT HIT ME
AT THAT MOMENT.
I WAS LIKE, "WOW, THERE'S
SOMETHING HERE." SO
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED --
IS IT SOMETHING LIKE FEBREZE,
THOUGH? I'M JUST CURIOUS.
LIKE, IS IT
THAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY,
OR IS THIS DIFFERENT?
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT.
WE HAVE --
I HAVE THREE CO-INVENTORS
ON THIS THAT ARE SCIENTISTS
THAT HAVE HELPED
WITH THIS PRODUCT.
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON IT?
WE'RE PATENT-PENDING.
PATENT-PENDING.
WE FEEL REALLY STRONG
ABOUT IT.
AND HOW MUCH
HAVE YOU SPENT SO FAR?
ON WHICH ASPECT?
ALL OF IT.
Cuban: ALL OF IT.
YEAH, WE'VE INVESTED A LOT
OF MONEY INTO THE COMPANY.
WHAT'S A LOT OF MONEY?
RIGHT. SO,
WE HAVE A FAMILY INVESTOR
WHO'S SPENT $2 MILLION
ON THE COMPANY SO FAR.
O'Leary: $2 MILLION?
Cuban: $2 MILLION?
Herjavec: WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
ON THE BOOKS,
THIS IS EARNEST CAPITAL.
ERIC, HANG ON.
YEAH, ROBERT.
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
$2 MILLION.
YEAH. WE HAVE $2 MILLION.
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE --
FROM A FAMILY FRIEND.
FROM A FAMILY MEMBER.
IT'S OUR FATHER WHO'S THE
EQUITY PARTNER IN THE BUSINESS.
OH, OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALE--
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES --
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES NOW?
IN UNDER 10 MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $510,000 IN SALES.
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING IT NOW?
THE FIRST PERSON TO SEE IT,
ODDLY ENOUGH,
HAPPENED TO BE A BUYER AT PETCO.
AM I JUST MASKING THE ODOR,
OR I'M ACTUALLY
REDUCING WHATEVER...
Greiner:
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
...THAT'S CREATING THE ODOR?
IN OTHER WORDS,
IF THERE'S A BACTERIA
THAT'S ROTTING ON YOUR DOG,
IS THIS KILLING THE BACTERIA,
OR AM I JUST MASKING IT?
IT'S MASKING THE ODOR,
WHICH --
Corcoran: FOR HOW LONG
WILL IT MASK THE ODOR?
Eric: IT REALLY SUSTAINS.
THEY TESTED THE CLOTHES
AN HOUR LATER -- NO PROBLEM.
SO, OUT OF THE $500,000,
IS IT ALL PETCO?
NO.
NO.
SO, PETCO'S ALMOST HALF
OF OUR BUSINESS SO FAR.
HOW MANY LOCATIONS?
ALL OF THEM.
UH, 1,200
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
AND WHAT'S THE AVERAGE COST
OF A UNIT?
IT'S 55 -- 55 CENTS,
AND EACH ONE RETAILS FOR $2.99.
Greiner: COSTS YOU 55 CENTS.
YEAH. REUSABLE.
EACH WIPE, EACH PET WIPE,
IS $2.99.
CORRECT.
SO, YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU PROJECTING
FOR SALES FOR THE NEXT YEAR?
WE, UH --
FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS,
WE HAVE $4 MILLION
IN PROJECTED SALES.
PROJECTING ON WHAT?
BASED ON WHAT?
WHOA.
AND I UNDERSTAND
IT'S A LEAP.
OKAY. OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND IT'S A LEAP.
AND I --
$500,000 TO $1.5 MILLION
IS A LEAP.
$500,000 TO $4 MILLION...
I-I REALLY GOT TO FOCUS
ON A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE
THAT NOBODY'S TOUCHED ON,
BUT THANK GOODNESS I'M HERE.
YOU'RE OFFERING ME
5% FOR $150,000.
THAT IMPUTES A VALUE
OF $3 MILLION.
AND YOU HAVE TAKEN $2 MILLION
FROM YOUR DAD, RIGHT?
WHAT DOES YOUR DAD DO
THAT HE CAN AFFORD
TO GIVE YOU $2 MILLION?
OKAY, SO, WE'RE -- WE --
WE'RE VERY LUCKY
TO COME FROM A SUCCESSFUL
ENTREPRENEURIAL FAMILY.
MY DAD'S
A SELF-MADE ENTREPRENEUR.
RIGHT.
HE STARTED A COMPANY
WHICH IS NOW CALLED GameStop,
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL RETAIL --
OH, YEAH.
OH, HE'S THE GameStop FOUNDER?
FAMILIAR WITH GameStop.
WOW.
Herjavec:
YOU'VE USED THE $2 MILLION.
THE $2 MILLION'S GONE.
CORRECT.
WHY DO YOU NEED
THE $150,000?
WE NEED YOU GUYS.
WE HAVE A BIG MEETING
WITH THE WORLD'S LARGEST
RETAILER IN AUGUST.
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION
WHEN WE'RE SITTING THERE.
O'Leary: LOOK,
YOU CAN MENTION THE NAME.
IS IT WALMART?
Both: IT IS WALMART.
ARE YOU GONNA DO A TEST, OR ARE
YOU GONNA ROLL ALL THE STORES?
I THINK IF YOU WERE THERE --
IT WOULD CHANGE
IF YOU WERE THERE.
IF YOU'RE THERE, HOPEFULLY,
WE'D GET INTO ALL STORES.
THIS IS SOME-- HE CAN MAKE
SOME INTRODUCTIONS.
YOUR DAD IS IN YOUR CORNER.
WHEN YOU'RE AT A MEETING
WITH WALMART, THEY DON'T CARE.
Cuban: I THINK
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
BUT FIRST,
YOU'RE NOT A TECHNOLOGY.
YOU'RE NOT A TECHNOLOGY
ANY MORE THAN TALCUM POWDER.
YOU'RE CALLING THIS
A TECHNOLOGY
BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW YOU PLACATE DAD.
I-I'M SORRY, I DON'T SEE --
IT'S A FORMULATION.
IT'S A FORMULATION
THAT WORKS.
IN MACHINERY --
WE ACTUALLY SPENT $150,000
IN CUSTOM MACHINERY.
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT A TECHNOLOGY.
AND YOU ONLY CALL IT
A TECHNOLOGY
BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO GO TO DAD
AND SAY, "DEAR DAD,
WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGY."
IT'S NOT A TECHNOLOGY.
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN.
BUT ERIC AND BEN
HAVE TURNED MARK OFF
WITH THEIR SPIN ON THE COMPANY.
Cuban: I THINK
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
BUT FIRST,
YOU'RE NOT A TECHNOLOGY.
I-I GUESS I MIGHT --
I-I UNDERSTAND.
I GUESS I UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IN REGARD
TO THE TECHNOLOGY ASPECT IS...
UH, WE JUST STARTED THINKING
OF OURSELVES AS TECHNOLOGY
BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURERS
ARE TELLING US WHAT THIS CAN DO.
IT CAN BE
A MOSQUITO REPELLENT.
YEAH, BUT WAIT. WAIT.
GREAT!
SO CAN TALCUM POWDER!
IT CAN DO
A LOT OF THINGS, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FANTASTIC,
THOUGH?
GUYS -- Shh.
I'M SORRY, MARK.
I APOLOGIZE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT, MARK.
DOES IT BOTHER YOU --
AND TELL ME IF MY MATH IS WRONG,
BECAUSE I'M STILL STRUGGLING
WITH SOMETHING --
YOUR NUMBER-ONE TEST
WAS PETCO.
YOU'VE DONE $250,000 THERE
IN 1,200 STORES.
YOU'VE SOLD, IN 10 MONTHS,
$208 PER STORE.
THAT'S LIKE 20 BUCKS.
Greiner: BEN,
LET ME ASK A QUESTION.
DO YOU AGREE
THAT 20 BUCKS A MONTH
IS -- IS LIKE RAT POOP
TO A BUYER?
HE WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
NOT AT SCALE. NOT AT ALL.
THAT'S NOT -- SO --
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
TO GETTING DE-LISTED THERE.
YOU NEED MUCH MORE IN SALES
TO JUSTIFY
A $3 MILLION VALUATION.
THAT IS THE REASON I'M OUT. I
DON'T CARE ABOUT THE REST OF IT.
WOW.
I FEEL VERY BADLY
SAYING THIS TO YOU,
BUT I,
AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,
DON'T INVEST
IN RICH KIDS' BUSINESSES.
NOW, THIS IS SAD, BECAUSE
IT'S A PREJUDICE FOR YOU.
COMING FROM MY BACKGROUND,
THE BEST PRIVILEGE I HAD
WAS I HAD 1,000 BUCKS
TO TRY TO MAKE A RUN WITH
THAT I BORROWED, BEGGED,
AND STEAL FOR.
YOU GOT TO DO
EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER,
'CAUSE THAT CLOCK IS TICKING,
TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK,
AND YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF GAS.
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING?
THE BIGGEST LIABILITY YOU HAVE
IS YOU'VE GOT A RICH DAD.
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN YOUR FAULT
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR.
BECAUSE I HAVE WATCHED --
ALL OF MY GREAT ENTREPRENEURS
THAT I'VE INVESTED IN
HAVE BEEN DIRT-POOR.
AND I LOVE THEM
POOR, HUNGRY, AND DESPERATE.
SO I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.
YOU THINK SO?
BECAUSE WHAT SHE
BASICALLY SAID IS
MY KIDS WILL NEVER BE SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE I'M -- I'M WELL-OFF.
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.
SUCCESS DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN
WHO YOUR DAD IS.
YOU DID SOMETHING.
REGARDLESS
OF WHERE YOU CAME FROM,
YOU GOT $500,000 IN SALES.
ABSOLUTELY.
Greiner: I DON'T CARE
IF YOUR DAD WAS RICH OR POOR
OR ANY OF THAT.
WHEN YOU WALKED IN HERE,
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"CHA-CHING-A-LING-A-DING-DONG."
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
BECAUSE THIS IS
A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT.
AND SO I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
WOW.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $150,000,
BUT I WANT 15%.
HEY, SHOULD WE GO...
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE OFFER.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
BUT THEY DON'T NEED IT.
NO. WE'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO
JUST -- IF YOU DON'T MIND --
BARBARA, I'M SORRY,
WE'RE HERE -- WE'RE HERE
WITH TRUE INTENTIONS.
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
A STRATEGIC PARTNER.
AND TO ME,
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE
ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD,
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT CONNECTIONS
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT STRATEGIC PARTNER,
YOU COULD GET IN A FEW STORES
AND THEN FIZZLE.
ROBERT, IS --
I-I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I KNOW WHERE YOU STAND.
LOOK, YOU -- YOU CAN'T ARGUE
WITH SALES.
HALF A MILLION IN SALES
IN 10 MONTHS,
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR.
THANK YOU.
O'Leary: ROBERT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
DO YOU WANT TO
INVEST IN THIS OR NOT?
I'LL GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 10%.
HE JUST CUT YOUR VALUATION
IN HALF.
WELL,
IT'S BETTER THAN LORI'S.
I PERSONALLY THINK
THAT YOU NEED TV,
YOU NEED QVC.
I THINK WE CAN TAKE THIS
TO THE TOP.
QVC,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO LORI,
IS ONE AVENUE. IT'S FANTASTIC.
I'M IN WALMART.
I'M IN HOME DEPOT.
I'M IN WALGREENS.
I'M IN EVERYWHERE, EVERY MAJOR.
BUT SHE-- SHE'S GIVING YOU...
BED BATH --
...AN UNDER-A-MILLION-DOLLAR
VALUATION.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
LORI, WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU
JOIN OUR FRESHNESS FAMILY.
CHA-CHING!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YAY.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
I LIKE IT.
I THINK THIS IS GONNA BLOW UP.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
LORI.
I REALLY DO.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
ROBERT, REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR OFFER.
Ben:
THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME.
GOOD LUCK.
TO BE RICH KIDS,
YOU HAVE TO BE RICH.
WE'RE NOT RICH,
SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
THAT'S AN UNFAIR
CHARACTERIZATION
OF HOW THEY MADE IT OUT TO BE
BECAUSE OF OUR FATHER'S SUCCESS.
NOW, <i>WILL</i> WE BE RICH?
I THINK WITH LORI ON BOARD,
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
BUT UNTIL THEN, I'D HOLD OFF
ON CALLING US RICH KIDS.
