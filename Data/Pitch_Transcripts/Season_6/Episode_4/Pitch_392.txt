I'M NOAH,
AND THIS IS MY DAD, BRIAN.
Brian: AND WE'RE FROM
HIGHLAND, UTAH.
DON'T FALL IN.
WHOA!
NOAH HAS BEEN
MY ACTIVITY BUDDY
SINCE HE WAS PROBABLY
2 YEARS OLD.
AND NOW WE DO
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
WE SHOULD PUT ONE MORE MATTRESS
OUT HERE.
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
I USED TO LOVE
PLAYING WITH ALL SORTS
OF DIFFERENT TOYS.
THE BEST ONES
WERE THE ONES I MADE MYSELF.
WHEN YOU THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX,
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
THIS CASTLE
IS GOING TO BE MINE!
ONLY 200 MORE.
THAT'S IT?
WE'RE GONNA SELL
MORE THAN THAT.
Brian: WHEN NOAH WAS BORN,
I WAS GETTING MY MBA,
BUT HAVING A YOUNG KID,
I FELT LIKE
I HAD TO TAKE THE SECURE PATH.
NOW THAT NOAH'S OLDER,
IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD TIME
TO START A BUSINESS TOGETHER,
AND WE BOTH CAN ENJOY IT.
I'M A 13-YEAR-OLD KID,
AND IT'S HARD
TO WALK INTO A STORE AND
ASK SOMEONE TO SELL MY PRODUCT.
WITH A SHARK BY MY SIDE,
PEOPLE WILL INSTANTLY WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
I'VE TAKEN NOAH
AS FAR AS I CAN.
WHAT WE NEED
IS AN INVESTMENT FROM THE SHARK
THAT CAN SHOW HIM WHAT TO DO
TO GET HIS BUSINESS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS NOAH,
AND I'M THE C.E.O.
OF PAPER BOX PILOTS.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M BRIAN,
AND THIS IS MILO.
HE'S OUR C.F.O.
YES, MR. WONDERFUL,
THAT'S "CHIEF FUN OFFICER."
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE ARE SEEKING $35,000
FOR A 25% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
AS A DAD,
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR WAYS TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH MY BOYS.
AND WHAT BETTER WAY THAN
BUILDING A BUSINESS TOGETHER?
ALL KIDS LOVE TO PLAY
IN CARDBOARD BOXES.
Corcoran: MM-HMM.
AS PARENTS, YOU'VE PROBABLY
EXPERIENCED THAT TIME
WHERE YOU BOUGHT A TOY
FOR YOUR KID
ONLY TO HAVE IT LEFT BEHIND
FOR THE BOX THAT IT CAME IN.
ALWAYS.
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
MY DAD AND I
USED TO BUILD
THE COOLEST BOX AIRPLANES.
AT 5 YEARS OLD,
I FELT LIKE I WAS A REAL PILOT.
SINCE WE ENJOYED THIS ACTIVITY
SO MUCH,
WE KNEW OTHER KIDS
WOULD LOVE TO DO IT, TOO.
SO LAST SUMMER,
MY LITTLE BROTHER, MILO, AND I
STARTED TO DESIGN
OUR PRODUCT TOGETHER.
PAPER BOX PILOTS
SELLS STICKER KITS
THAT TURN A PLAIN, OLD BOX
INTO AMAZING-LOOKING VEHICLES.
OUR STICKER KITS
PROVIDE HOURS OF CREATIVE PLAY
THAT KIDS NEED
AND MOMS LOVE.
NOAH'S BROUGHT IN
SOME SAMPLES OF HIS PRODUCT
SO HE COULD
SHARE IT WITH YOU
AND TRY STICKING THE STICKERS
FOR YOURSELF.
NICE, NOAH.
YOU'RE SELLING THE BOX
<i>AND</i> THE STICKERS?
WE ACTUALLY ONLY SELL
THE STICKER KITS.
SO, WAIT. SO I UNDERSTAND,
YOU ARE NOT SELLING THE BOXES.
I COULDN'T GO TO A WEBSITE
AND, FOR MY SON JAKE,
GET, LIKE, A PRE-CONFIGURED,
PRE-FOLDED, PRE-EVERYTHING.
THAT'S ACTUALLY
OUR DIFFERENTIATOR.
SO, THERE ARE
OTHER COMPETITORS
THAT DO TRY TO SELL
THE PRE-FOLDED BOXES,
AND THAT'S NOT US.
WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL --
WHAT'S NICE, THOUGH,
IS YOU HAVE A DIAGRAM.
YEAH. THE DIAGRAM IS VERY
IMPORTANT IN EVERY KIT...
THE DIAGRAM
SHOWS HOW TO DO IT.
...SO THEY CAN MAKE THIS
WITH WHATEVER THEY GOT.
ROBERT, WE GOT
A SPECIAL TREAT FOR YOU
IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT OUT.
I <i>DO</i> WANT TO TRY IT OUT.
OKAY.
SO, WE KNOW YOU LIKE RACING.
OHH. THAT IS COOL.
Corcoran: ADORABLE.
MILO WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE A FRIEND UP HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN'T BUY THE WHOLE KIT,
HUH?
WE DON'T SELL THE KITS,
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY
OUR DIFFERENTIATOR.
Greiner: YOU FIT!
[ IMITATES ENGINE REVVING ]
THERE WE GO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S COOL.
YEAH. IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
AND IT BRINGS OUT
THAT CREATIVITY.
HEY, WE'RE GONNA INVITE YOU
TO GO BACK TO FIND MOM NOW.
THANKS, BUD.
BYE, MILO.
BYE.
SEE YA, MILO.
BYE.
HE'S FLYING OUT.
HOW HARD IS IT
TO TAKE A NORMAL BOX
AND MAKE IT
LIKE THE RACECAR?
Brian:
AS LORI POINTED OUT,
THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE THERE
TO DO A VERY SIMPLE BOX.
I KNOW THESE ARE PAINTED,
BUT WE PREFER THAT THE
KIDS JUST HAVE THE FUN
PLAYING IN THE BOX.
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES US DIFFERENT.
DID YOU
INVESTIGATE THE MODEL
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY CREATED
A PRE-CUT BOX?
BECAUSE IT STILL MAKES IT A LOT
EASIER FOR ME AS A CONSUMER.
AS A DAD,
I-IT'S MUCH MORE WORK.
BUT THAT'S WHAT <i>NICE</i> DADS
DO WITH CHILDREN.
Corcoran:
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, YOU KNOW.
Cuban: BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT SMART DADS DO?
SMART DADS DON'T SET
A HIGH EXPECTATION
THAT THEY CAN'T FULFILL,
RIGHT?
AFTER SEEING THIS,
THERE'S NO CHANCE
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT
FOR MY SON JAKE.
HE'S GONNA LOOK AT WHAT I DO,
AND HE'S GONNA LOOK AT THAT...
O'Leary: BUT DID YOU LOOK
AT DOING THAT? DID YOU LOOK --
THAT'S A CHALLENGE.
IF I BUY THIS STICKER KIT,
WHAT AM I GONNA PAY?
IF I BUY A COMPETITOR
THAT INCLUDES THE BOX,
WHAT AM I GOING TO PAY?
UM, WELL,
YOU CAN BUY THAT FOR $7.99.
AND WITH A COMPETITOR THAT HAS
THE BOX ALL CUT OUT FOR YOU,
IT'S FOUR TO SIX TIMES
MORE EXPENSIVE.
Brian: THE VERY FIRST
RETAIL STORE WE WENT INTO --
IT WAS A LOCAL TOY STORE,
INDEPENDENT TOY STORY --
THEY SELL
THOSE TYPES OF KITS.
WHEN WE PUT OUR PRODUCT
OUT THERE,
WE EASILY SOLD 30 OR 40
TO 1 OF WHAT THEY SOLD.
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
UM, WELL, WE STARTED THIS
COMPANY EIGHT MONTHS AGO,
AND WE'VE MADE
AROUND $7,500 NOW.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
94 CENTS
FOR THE COMPLETED KIT.
WE WHOLESALE FOR $3.75.
GOT IT.
WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
RIGHT NOW?
UM, WE'RE SELLING
IN 23 RETAIL ACCOUNTS,
MOSTLY INDEPENDENT
TOY STORES,
AND WE'RE ALSO SELLING IT
TO A BOUTIQUE,
A HARDWARE STORE,
AND A BOX STORE.
ARE YOU SELLING THIS ONLINE?
YEAH. THIS IS ACTUALLY
HOW WE STARTED. WE STARTED --
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR SALES IS STILL ONLINE?
WELL, WE DO
ABOUT THIRD EQUALLY.
SO, WE HAVE A THIRD
ONLINE SALES,
A THIRD GO INTO
OUR WHOLESALE RETAIL ACCOUNTS,
AND OUR OTHER THIRD WE DID
THROUGH DEAL SITES
WHERE WE WERE
TESTING THE MARKET.
HOW MUCH OF THE BUSINESS
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY DONE
VERSUS JUST YOUR DAD?
UM, I'M INVOLVED
IN EVERY SALE THAT WE DO.
WE'VE GONE TO
ALL THE VENDORS TOGETHER.
HE CHOSE THE PAPER.
HE'S BEEN TO THE PRINTERS.
HE -- THAT'S, YOU KNOW, SORT OF
WHY OUR SALES ARE SO SMALL...
WHAT A GREAT EDUCATION.
...IS I HAVE HIM DO THE SALES,
AND HE'S BEEN AWESOME.
Corcoran:
SO YOU'RE THE REAL BUSINESSMAN,
AND HE'S JUST
TAKING ALL THE CREDIT HERE?
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M DEFINITELY BEHIND IT.
I MEAN, THAT KIND OF GOES INTO
THE STORY OF WHY WE DID THIS.
I -- WHEN NOAH WAS BORN,
I WAS GETTING MY MBA.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE AN ENTREPRENEUR.
BUT WHEN I BROUGHT HOME
THAT LITTLE GUY, UM...
YOU KNOW, I-IT'S A FEELING
OF RESPONSIBILITY,
THAT YOU HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL.
AND I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
TO TAKE THAT -- THAT RISK.
SO, YOU'RE REALLY ALSO LIVING
YOUR OLD DREAM THROUGH HIM.
YEAH. I-I DON'T WANT
TO TEACH HIM
THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PATH
IN LIFE,
THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW
THIS CORPORATE LADDER.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO OWN MY OWN BUSINESS
AND SHOW HIM THAT.
ARE YOU ADVERSE IN OFFERING
A VERSION THAT INCLUDES THE BOX?
BECAUSE THERE IS
SOME SEGMENT OF THE MARKET
THAT FALLS INTO MY CATEGORY
THAT SAYS --
LAZY.
EXACTLY.
"I'M LAZY. I WANT A SOLUTION.
I'M WILLING TO PAY MORE."
BECAUSE I SEE IT, I LOVE IT.
IT'S SIMPLE.
IT FALLS INTO THIS TREND
OF ANTI-ELECTRONICS TOYS.
EXACTLY.
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO.
I-I LIKE THE STORY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE 35K.
I WANT TO BE A 50/50 PARTNER
WITH ONE CONDITION...
...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE BOX
AVAILABLE FOR ME TO BUY ONLINE.
YOU DO NOT HAVE
TO PUT IT THROUGH RETAIL.
YOU CAN START WITH THAT.
AND, NOAH,
I GOT THE BAD NEWS FOR YOU --
YOU'VE GOT TO
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU GOT TO BE FULL-TIME, BUDDY.
THAT'S HOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS.
WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN, NOAH?
I'M IN 8th GRADE.
IT'S TIME.
SO WHAT? YOU MISS A FEW GRADES.
NOT A PROBLEM.
WELL, UM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR OFFER, KEVIN.
WE'RE SUPER GRATEFUL
FOR YOU
TO GIVE US THIS CHANCE
AND SEE THIS FUTURE,
AND WE WERE JUST WONDERING
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
GUYS, CONGRATULATIONS.
I THINK YOU'RE SETTING
AN EXAMPLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT A PARENT AND A CHILD CAN
BOND OVER CREATING A COMPANY.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN ADD A LOT OF VALUE
IN THE TOY BUSINESS.
KEVIN'S GOT
A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE.
I THINK HE MADE YOU A VERY FAIR
OFFER THAT I COULDN'T MATCH.
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANKS. THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY.
YOU KNOW, I, UM --
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
THANKS.
I LIKE THE LOGO.
I LOVE THE SIMPLICITY OF IT.
BUT I FEEL THAT IT'S NOT REALLY
SOMETHING SCALABLE,
SO I'M OUT.
WE APPRECIATE THE ADVICE.
YES, THANK YOU.
BUT CALL ME
IN SEVERAL YEARS.
I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
INTERN FOR ME.
THERE YOU GO.
Corcoran: GREAT.
COOL.
BARBARA?
HARD ONE.
ROBERT?
Herjavec: I GOT TO TELL YOU,
BEFORE MY SON WAS BORN,
I WAS A LOT LIKE KEVIN.
I HAD NO HAIR.
I HAD A COLD HEART.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A BUCK.
AND THEN MY SON WAS BORN,
AND IT GAVE ME PURPOSE.
I MEAN, I STILL WANTED TO MAKE
A BUCK. DON'T GET ME WRONG.
BUT I WANTED
TO BUILD SOMETHING GREAT.
I THINK
YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
BUT I THINK
YOU'VE GOT TO PACKAGE IT
JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY.
IF YOU CAN SELL
A COMPLETE PACKAGE,
YOU'RE GONNA SELL
A TON OF THESE.
LIKE, A <i>TON</i> OF THESE.
UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.
SO, ARE YOU WILLING
TO INCREASE
OVER KEVIN'S OFFER
SO THAT WE CAN DO THE --
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU,
I'M NOT SURE YOU WANT TO HAVE
KEVIN AS AN INVESTOR
IN A BUSINESS
THAT APPEALS TO CHILDREN.
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT ONE.
KEVIN SCARES CHILDREN.
THE REASON
THAT'S INCORRECT IS I MADE
ALL MY MONEY IN A BUSINESS
THAT APPEALS TO CHILDREN.
MY LARGEST DEAL...
BUT THEY NEVER MET KEVIN.
...WAS FOR $4 BILLION
TO MATTEL.
SO I KNOW YOUR INDUSTRY
PRETTY WELL.
YOU NEED RELATIONSHIPS WITH
TOY COMPANIES' DISTRIBUTION.
GOT THAT. CHECK.
YOU NEED COMMERCIAL PRINTING.
I'M AN INVESTOR IN
A COMMERCIAL PRINTER RIGHT NOW.
YOU'LL PAY FOR YOUR COLLEGE
IF THIS WORKS, NOAH.
BRIAN, NOAH, KEVIN'S IDEAS --
ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER,
OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
KEVIN'S IDEAS ARE WONDERFUL, BUT
WE'RE A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM IT.
LET'S GO, ROBERT.
WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.
Greiner:
YEAH, ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER?
I'M GONNA MAKE
THE SAME OFFER.
I'M GONNA MAKE
THE SAME OFFER AS KEVIN.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $35,000
FOR 50%.
Corcoran:
UM, HERE'S MY THINKING.
UM, YOU REMIND ME, OF COURSE,
OF RYAN FROM RYAN'S BARKERY.
AND HIS BUSINESS IS FLYING.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A $35,000 OFFER FOR 35%,
ONLY 'CAUSE THE NUMBERS MATCH.
IT SOUNDS COOL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SOUNDS COOL.
TWO CONTINGENCIES ARE THIS --
ONE, IF YOU WANT
TO TAKE MY DEAL --
AND YOU'D BE OUT OF YOUR MIND
TO PASS THIS UP --
PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT TO
MAKE THIS THING GIRL-FRIENDLY.
YOU GOT TWO BOYS
ON THE COVER.
THE PILOT'S A MALE, OKAY?
SO YOU HAVE
TO JUST DO A RE-DO
SO YOU CAN OFFER ONLINE
A GIRL AND A BOY'S VERSIONS.
AND YOU HAVE TO USE
AN OPTION ON THAT --
OPTION FOR A BOX.
SO, ON THOSE 2 CONTINGENCIES,
THE OFFER IS $35,000 FOR 35%.
OKAY.
SHE'S OFFERED YOU
$35,000 FOR 35%.
I WAS AT 50%,
SO I'LL UP MY OFFER
TO $50,000 FOR 50%
JUST -- JUST SO THE MATH
IS THE SAME.
AND, BRIAN,
IT SOUNDS COOL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I'M THE FUN SHARK!
THIS IS A FUN TOY.
I'M STAYING
EXACTLY WHERE I STARTED ALL THIS
BECAUSE I ADD THE MOST VALUE.
NO ONE ELSE HERE
HAS SOLD ANYTHING
TO A TOY COMPANY
FOR $4 BILLION.
SO I'M GONNA JUST LEAVE THAT OUT
THERE FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT.
NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION,
NOAH. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
UM, WELL [CHUCKLES]
UH [CHUCKLES]
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
NOAH AND HIS DAD, BRIAN,
HAVE THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR STICKER COMPANY,
PAPER BOX PILOTS.
BARBARA'S OFFER
IS $35,000 FOR 35%.
KEVIN'S IS $35,000 FOR 50%,
AND ROBERT'S
IS $50,000 FOR 50%.
NOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION,
NOAH. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
UH [CHUCKLES]
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S TOUGH.
BELIEVE ME, LIFE COULD --
LIFE COULD BE WORSE.
SOME OF
THE HARDEST MOMENTS.
VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT COME
IN THE SHARK TANK AT <i>ANY</i> AGE
GET THREE OFFERS LIKE THIS.
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
OR DO YOU HAVE ANY COUNTERS?
SO, WE'D BE CRAZY
NOT TO TRY
TO STEAL A LITTLE INFORMATION
OR KNOWLEDGE FROM YOU.
YOU'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT
THE BOXES.
Corcoran: LET ME --
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT'S CHALLENGING FOR US --
LET ME SUGGEST
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.
YOU HAVE THREE ROCK-SOLID OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE
AWAY FROM THE CLOSE,
YOU WANT TO MOVE TOWARD IT.
SO, ALL I CAN SAY...
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE THE C.E.O.
YOU KNOW, THE DECISION'S
ULTIMATELY YOURS.
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT'S A TOUGH ONE,
BUT WHAT A WONDERFUL PROBLEM.
DON'T SCREW IT UP.
UM...
[ Chuckling ] I DON'T KNOW.
THESE ARE ALL
REALLY GOOD OPTIONS.
SO [CHUCKLES]
WHICH ONE?
WHO DO YOU THINK
WOULD BE THE BEST MENTOR?
UM [CHUCKLES]
WELL...
I THINK THESE ARE ALL
REALLY GOOD OFFERS.
YOU GUYS ALL BRING A LOT
TO THE TABLE FOR ME.
UM...
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT...
UM, MR. WONDERFUL, KEVIN, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO DO AN OFFER WITH US?
OH!
WHAT?
WHOO-HOO!
UNBELIEVABLE.
Cuban: YAY! THAT'S A FIRST!
Herjavec: YEAH!
CONGRATULATIONS, NOAH.
HE LOOKS UP TO HIM, OBVIOUSLY.
THIS IS GONNA BE A WILD RIDE.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
I'M SHOCKED.
GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
TAKE CARE.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
WHY'D YOU PICK KEVIN? YOU GOT
TO TELL ME. THIS IS AMAZING.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, 'CAUSE HIS
WAS THE WORST OFFER IN TERMS
OF EQUITY, IN TERMS OF CASH.
AND THE WORST GUY.
Noah: WELL, IT'S REALLY --
KEVIN HAS A TON OF BACKGROUND
IN THE TOY INDUSTRY.
HE'S GOT ALL THE BACKGROUND
THAT WE NEED FOR THIS COMPANY.
VERY THOUGHTFUL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
Greiner: CONGRATS.
GOOD LUCK.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.
YOU DID GOOD.
THAT'S WHAT WE CAME TO DO.
YEAH.
WAS A LOT OF WORK.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO SHOW HIM
THAT IF YOU TAKE RISKS,
YOU KNOW,
BIG THINGS WILL HAPPEN.
I DIDN'T TAKE THAT RISK,
AND I'VE ALWAYS --
[ Voice breaking ]
I'VE ALWAYS REGRETTED IT.
HE DID IT.
HE'S OVERCOME THAT -- THAT FEAR.
Narrator:
LAST SEASON, BRIAN HOOKS
AND HIS DAUGHTERS EMMA AND LILY
STRUCK A DEAL WITH LORI GREINER
FOR THEIR HOMEMADE SCREEN-REPAIR
PRODUCT ScreenMend.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I WOULD WANT 50% OF THE COMPANY.
WE ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
HOW ScreenMend IS DOING NOW.
WATCH THIS.
Emma: LORI ISN'T KIDDING
WHEN SHE SAYS
SHE MOVES AT LIGHTNING SPEED.
WITHIN TWO MONTHS
OF WORKING WITH HER,
WE WERE DOING SHOWS ON QVC.
SO, HERE'S THE PACKAGE.
YOU'RE GETTING TWO IN EACH.
Emma:
WORKING ON QVC WAS ONE OF THE
COOLEST THINGS I'VE EVER DONE.
WITHIN JUST 10 MINUTES ON QVC,
WE SOLD OUT OF ALL 32,000 UNITS.
WE'RE SO EXCITED.
Brian:
GIRLS, HOW ARE WE DOING?
WE GOT A LOT OF ORDERS
TO FILL.
BEFORE WE CAME ON
"SHARK TANK,"
WE'D ONLY DONE
ABOUT $4,000 IN SALES.
SINCE AIRING ON "SHARK TANK"
EIGHT MONTHS AGO,
WE'VE DONE OVER $900,000
IN SALES.
WE DESPERATELY NEED TO GET OUT
OF THE GARAGE
IF WE'RE GONNA KEEP UP
WITH THE DEMAND.
WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE THE BIG
MOVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
HI, GUYS!
LORI!
AHH!
Greiner:
I CAME OUT TO LONG ISLAND TODAY
TO BRING BRIAN AND THE GIRLS
SOME BIG NEWS ABOUT ScreenMend.
NEW PACKAGING!
Emma: THEY LOOK FANTASTIC.
WE'RE GONNA BE
IN BED BATH &amp; BEYOND...
NO.
...LOWE'S, ACE, AND HOME DEPOT.
OH, THAT'S AWESOME.
Emma: OH, MY GOODNESS.
Greiner: I THINK ScreenMend
IS GOING TO BE A WILD SUCCESS.
WE'RE GETTING INTO
SO MANY WONDERFUL PLACES.
IT'S EXCITING
FOR THE WHOLE TEAM.
ONE LAST SURPRISE.
YEAH?
I'M FINALLY GONNA
GET YOU OUT OF HERE,
BECAUSE WITHIN WEEKS, WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A NEW FACILITY.
SO, GOODBYE, GARAGE.
WE'RE OUT OF THE GARAGE.
THANK GOODNESS.
Emma: LORI'S TAUGHT US THAT
IF WE BELIEVE IN OUR BUSINESS,
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
Lily:
I HOPE TO BE A SHARK.
I THINK IT'S SO COOL,
AND I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE LORI.
YOU ARE A SHARK'S DREAM.
Brian:
AS OUR BUSINESS HAS GROWN,
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
MY DAUGHTERS HAS ALSO GROWN.
IT'S SUCH A THRILL TO BE ABLE
TO WORK WITH MY TWO GIRLS.
THIS IS SOMETHING
WE'LL CHERISH FOREVER.
