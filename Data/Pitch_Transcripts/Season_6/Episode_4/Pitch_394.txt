Christian:
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS STEVE CHRISTIAN,
PROUDLY FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
I'M ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR 25% OF MY BUSINESS --
THE TABLE JACKS.
I'VE BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT
INDUSTRY FOR 18 YEARS,
Christian: YOU'RE WELCOME
TO OPEN THE PACKAGES UP.
THANK YOU.
UH-HUH.
THANK YOU.
LORI.
Cuban: THIS IS ONE OF
THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE.
RIGHT.
THERE'S
"WHERE'S THE OTHER SOCK?"
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES, STEVE?
MY SALES RIGHT NOW,
WITHIN THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD
OF TIME IN BUSINESS,
WE'RE NEARING $200,000
IN SALES.
BUT YOU STARTED IT
EIGHT YEARS AGO.
NO, I STARTED <i>WORKING</i> ON IT
EIGHT YEARS AGO, OKAY?
NOW, LET ME TELL YOU
THE REASON ABOUT THAT.
AGAIN, I OWN THREE RESTAURANTS.
I'M DOING THIS BY MYSELF.
SIX MONTHS AGO,
I SOLD TWO OF MY RESTAURANTS...
YOUR OWN RESTAURANTS.
...FOR A PROFIT.
AND SAY, "LOOK, STEVE, MY BUDDY
IN HOUSTON, SOLVED THE PROBLEM
"BY HAVING YOU INSTALL THESE
"ON NEW TABLES
EVERY TIME YOU SHIP ONE.
YOU GOT TO PAY ME A ROYALTY
'CAUSE I HAVE A PATENT," RIGHT?
I HAVE A UTILITY PATENT,
A VERY STRONG UTILITY PATENT.
OKAY. IS IT BETTER FOR YOU
TO PUT ALL OF YOUR TIME
GOING TO THE MANUFACTURERS
OF THE TABLES --
NO, BECAUSE
IF THERE'S 9,000 RESTAURANTS
OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS,
RIGHT...
NO.
I WANT YOU HEAR ME ON THIS,
STEVE.
OHH.
IT'S A STORY THAT I THINK
WILL DEFINE YOUR BUSINESS.
IT'S GONNA HELP YOU.
WHAT'S IT CALLED?
STEVE, I WORKED
IN A LOT OF BARS,
STEVE, LOOK.
I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?
ANYBODY WHO GOES DOOR-TO-DOOR
IS JUST CLOSE TO MY HEART,
'CAUSE I GREW UP
SELLING MAGAZINES DOOR-TO-DOOR.
THANK YOU, STEVE.
HEY, THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU, STEVE.
LOT OF FUN.
I LOVED HIM.
I LOVED HIM.
Christian: I HOPE THAT WHEN
THE SHARKS GO TO DINNER TONIGHT,
I HOPE THAT THEIR TABLE
DOES WOBBLE,
OR ANY OTHER TIME THEY GO,
'CAUSE THEY WILL BE THANKING
TABLE JACKS
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A UNIQUE WAY TO SMELL FRESH.
