Christian:
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS STEVE CHRISTIAN,
PROUDLY FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
I'M ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR 25% OF MY BUSINESS --
THE TABLE JACKS.
I'VE BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT
INDUSTRY FOR 18 YEARS,
AND I HATE THE SAME THINGS
THAT MY CUSTOMERS DO --
WOBBLY TABLES.
IT'S AN OUTRAGE.
NUMBER-ONE COMPLAINT
IN THE RESTAURANTS.
NORMALLY, WE WOULD GET DOWN
AND PUT PRODUCTS
UNDERNEATH THE TABLE
SO THAT WE COULD
STABLE THEM OUT.
WHAT I'VE INVENTED
IS THE LONGEST-LASTING,
MOST COST-EFFICIENT,
DURABLE STABILIZER EVER MADE...
...THE TABLE JACK.
WITH A PRESS OF THE FOOT,
NOW THE WAIT STAFF --
WATCH CLOSELY, IT WORKS FAST.
WITH A PRESS OF THE FOOT, THE
WAITRESS CAN DROP THE TABLE DOWN
AND STABILIZE THE TABLE,
SERVE THE CUSTOMERS,
INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO FIX THE FURNITURE.
WELL DONE.
AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
BY USING THREE STATIONARY GLIDES
THAT COME IN THE KIT
AND ONE TABLE JACK,
WE CAN STABILIZE THE TABLE
NO MATTER WHICH WAY IT WOBBLES,
LEFT OR RIGHT, FRONT OR BACK,
SIMPLY WITH THE PRESS
OF THE FOOT.
YOU KNOW, SHARKS,
WE'VE BEGUN TO GET INQUIRIES
Christian: YOU'RE WELCOME
TO OPEN THE PACKAGES UP.
THANK YOU.
UH-HUH.
THANK YOU.
LORI.
Cuban: THIS IS ONE OF
THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE.
RIGHT.
THERE'S
"WHERE'S THE OTHER SOCK?"
YEAH.
AND "WHY DO TABLES WOBBLE?"
SO EXPLAIN TO US
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FLOOR
AND HOW THAT CAUSES IT
TO WOBBLE.
WELL, THERE IS
NO PERFECTLY LEVEL CONCRETE.
IF YOU LOOK
AT THIS WOOD RIGHT HERE,
WHEN THIS WOOD
STARTS SETTLING IN,
IT'S GONNA HAVE
THE HUMPS IN IT.
THAT'S WHAT DROVE ME IN.
ME WALKING INTO MY RESTAURANTS
AND SEEING THIS STUFF
IS WHAT DROVE ME IN
EIGHT YEARS AGO
TO START DESIGNING
THE TABLE JACKS.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES, STEVE?
MY SALES RIGHT NOW,
WITHIN THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD
OF TIME IN BUSINESS,
WE'RE NEARING $200,000
IN SALES.
BUT YOU STARTED IT
EIGHT YEARS AGO.
NO, I STARTED <i>WORKING</i> ON IT
EIGHT YEARS AGO, OKAY?
NOW, LET ME TELL YOU
THE REASON ABOUT THAT.
AGAIN, I OWN THREE RESTAURANTS.
I'M DOING THIS BY MYSELF.
SIX MONTHS AGO,
I SOLD TWO OF MY RESTAURANTS...
YOUR OWN RESTAURANTS.
...FOR A PROFIT.
AND WHEN I PUT THEM
ON THE MARKET, EVERYBODY WAS,
"WHY ARE YOU SELLING THIS
POSITIVE-CASH FLOW BUSINESS?"
THAT I-I PUT FROM THE GROUND UP
WITH 94 EMPLOYEES.
SO, WHY <i>DID</i> YOU SELL THEM?
I SOLD THEM 'CAUSE I SEE
MORE VALUE THAN IN HERE --
O'Leary:
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
I SEE THE OPPORTUNITY,
I SEE THE VALUE.
BETTER THAN
MOST STRAP-ON TABLE LEGS.
GOT IT, ALL THAT.
YES, SIR.
TWO OPTIONS HERE --
ONE IS I RETROFIT
THE WHOLE WORLD OF TABLES
BY FINDING EACH TABLE
ONE AT A TIME.
I DIE OF OLD AGE
BEFORE I EVER MAKE ANY MONEY.
OPTION TWO IS I GO TO
THE MANUFACTURER OF TABLES
AND SAY, "LOOK, STEVE, MY BUDDY
IN HOUSTON, SOLVED THE PROBLEM
"BY HAVING YOU INSTALL THESE
"ON NEW TABLES
EVERY TIME YOU SHIP ONE.
YOU GOT TO PAY ME A ROYALTY
'CAUSE I HAVE A PATENT," RIGHT?
I HAVE A UTILITY PATENT,
A VERY STRONG UTILITY PATENT.
OKAY. IS IT BETTER FOR YOU
TO PUT ALL OF YOUR TIME
GOING TO THE MANUFACTURERS
OF THE TABLES --
NO, BECAUSE
IF THERE'S 9,000 RESTAURANTS
OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS,
RIGHT...
NO.
...AND THEY ALL HAVE
A TABLE,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA IMMEDIATELY
REPLACE THOSE TABLES.
I DON'T CARE.
HE'LL DIE OF OLD AGE
TRYING TO GET SALES
TO ALL THOSE RESTAURANTS.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
YOU WENT TO THE TRADE SHOW
OF ALL THE RESTAURANTS?
BUT THERE'S DISTRIBUTORS
THAT SELL TO ALL OF THEM.
I CAN ANSWER Y'ALL'S QUESTIONS
REAL EASY RIGHT NOW.
WELL, WE'RE -- WE'RE FIGHTING
AMONGST OURSELVES.
I UNDERSTAND.
PLEASE STAY OUT OF IT.
PLEASE STAY OUT OF IT.
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
WAIT.
THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT
THERE'S -- THERE'S KIND OF
A BINARY DECISION,
BECAUSE TRYING
TO GET TO EVERY TABLE
THAT'S ALREADY IN A RESTAURANT
IS A HUGE HASSLE.
I'M ALREADY DOING IT.
I JUST NOW PUT -- I'VE GOT --
RIGHT NOW, I'VE GOT
PHOENIX, MIAMI, LAS VEGAS, L.A.
FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS,
I BEEN SELLING OUT HERE IN L.A.
AT RODEO BOULEVARD YESTERDAY.
I SOLD AT VENICE BEACH.
I SOLD RESTAURANTS --
WAIT, WAIT.
YOU WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR?
I LOVE IT.
I'VE GOT A GUY IN TEXAS
THAT IS PUTTING 100 TO 300
OF THESE A WEEK ON RIGHT NOW.
THERE'S A VERY, VERY FAMOUS
PIECE OF LITERATURE --
I WANT YOU HEAR ME ON THIS,
STEVE.
OHH.
IT'S A STORY THAT I THINK
WILL DEFINE YOUR BUSINESS.
IT'S GONNA HELP YOU.
WHAT'S IT CALLED?
DANTE. AND HE WROTE
THE VERSIONS OF HELL.
"INFERNO."
THERE'S SEVEN DIFFERENT LEVELS
OF HELL.
THE SEVENTH LEVEL
IS YOU IN A RESTAURANT
CHANGING OUT
THE BOTTOM OF A TABLE.
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR ANY MORE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Greiner:
WHAT DO THEY COST?
NOBODY'S EVEN ASKED YOU
WHAT A PACKAGE COSTS.
Herjavec: YEAH,
WHAT DOES IT COST?
[ CHUCKLES ]
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SO, IT'S $15.
THIS KIT IS $15?
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT?
$3.65.
STEVE, I WORKED
IN A LOT OF BARS,
AND WE USED
SUGAR PACKETS.
THEM SUGAR PACKS
COST ME MONEY.
THAT'S WHY
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
BUT I'M LISTENING TO YOU,
AND I'M NOT CLEAR.
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT BIGGER?
YOU COULD TALK A DOG OFF
A MEAT WAGON, I'M TELLING YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CAN IT WORK
ON A FOUR-LEGGED TABLE
OR ONLY WITH
THIS KIND OF A BASE?
WELL, IT'S A FOUR-LEGGED --
NO, NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
FOUR SEPARATE LEGS.
IT DOESN'T WORK. IT HAS TO HAVE
THIS CONFIGURATION HERE.
WELL, THE FOUR-LEGGED TABLE
IS -- IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT.
SO, NO.
THAT IS -- THAT IS --
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE ONLY ON THE --
YEAH. GOT IT.
GOT IT. NO.
WAS THAT A NO?
THAT WAS A NO, I THINK.
WELL, I MEAN,
I COULD MOUNT --
I-I COULD D-DESIGN IT
TO FIT TO THIS.
OKAY. OKAY.
HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING, OKAY?
MM-HMM.
I WAS WORKING AS A WAITRESS
WHEN I GOT MY $1,000 LOAN
TO START MY BUSINESS.
AND THAT WAS
A CONSTANT PROBLEM.
MM-HMM.
BUT LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT WAS KEY TO MAKING THE TIPS.
STEVE, LOOK.
I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?
ANYBODY WHO GOES DOOR-TO-DOOR
IS JUST CLOSE TO MY HEART,
'CAUSE I GREW UP
SELLING MAGAZINES DOOR-TO-DOOR.
AND IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO GO DOOR-TO-DOOR,
YOU CAN SELL ANYTHING.
ANYTHING.
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
I'M NOT READY TO INVEST $100,000
TO -- TO BE A PARTNER.
I'M NOT READY
TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT
OR -- OR THE INVESTMENTS.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, STEVE.
HEY, THANK YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU, STEVE.
LOT OF FUN.
I LOVED HIM.
I LOVED HIM.
Christian: I HOPE THAT WHEN
THE SHARKS GO TO DINNER TONIGHT,
I HOPE THAT THEIR TABLE
DOES WOBBLE,
OR ANY OTHER TIME THEY GO,
'CAUSE THEY WILL BE THANKING
TABLE JACKS
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A UNIQUE WAY TO SMELL FRESH.
