HI.
MY NAME IS KIMBERLY AYA.
AND I'M HER SON KORAY, AND WE'RE
FROM GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN,
AND OUR COMPANY
IS FUNCAKES.
WE'RE HERE TODAY
ASKING FOR $285,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 25% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
WE BELIEVE
THAT EVERY BRIDE
DESERVES TO HAVE A GORGEOUS CAKE
AT HER WEDDING.
BUT THOSE SKY-HIGH TIERS,
INTRICATE DESIGNS,
SUGAR FLOWERS -- THEY ALL COME
AT A STEEP COST.
THE PRICE OF WEDDINGS
HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND,
ESPECIALLY
IN TODAY'S ECONOMY.
SO BRIDES ON A BUDGET --
THEY COME TO US
BECAUSE WE DELIVER IT ALL BUT
ONLY AT A SLICE OF THE PRICE.
BUT ON TOP OF THAT,
WE HAVE A NEW AND UNIQUE CAKE.
IT HAS ZERO CALORIES.
IT IS GLUTEN-FREE,
SUGAR-FREE, LACTOSE-FREE,
AND IT HAS A SHELF LIFE
OF 7-PLUS YEARS.
SO, YOU MAY ASK,
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
WELL, OUR CAKES...
ARE MADE OF FOAM.
Corcoran: [ Laughing ] OH!
AND THEY'RE RENTALS.
GREAT FOOLER.
WOW.
OUR CAKES ARE COVERED
IN REAL FONDANT AND GUM PASTE,
EXACTLY THE SAME AS A REAL CAKE.
THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT
IS THE INSIDE IS FOAM.
EACH CAKE HAS
A SECRET COMPARTMENT IN THE BACK
WHERE REAL CAKE
CAN BE PLACED.
THIS WAY, THE BRIDE AND GROOM
CAN STILL CUT THE CAKE,
FEED EACH OTHER,
GET ALL THEIR PHOTOS.
THEN THE CAKE
IS WHEELED TO THE BACK,
AND SHEET CAKES
ARE SERVED TO THEIR GUESTS.
NO ONE IS THE WISER.
HOW CLEVER THAT IS.
WE SEE THIS AS THE FUTURE
OF THE WEDDING CAKE.
WE HOPE TO KEEP THE TRADITION
OF THE WEDDING CAKE ALIVE,
BUT AT A PRICE
COUPLES CAN AFFORD.
SO, SHARKS, WHO WANTS
TO JOIN THE FUN WITH FUNCAKES?
OUR CAKES MAY BE FAKE,
BUT OUR MONEY IS REAL.
THE IDEA'S BRILLIANT.
THANK YOU.
ONE -- ARE THERE
OTHER PEOPLE DOING IT?
NO.
NOBODY ELSE?
THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE
COPIED US, BUT NOBODY SHIPS.
WE SHIP OUR CAKES
WORLDWIDE.
AND THEY SHIP THEM
BACK TO YOU AFTER?
CORRECT.
CAN YOU SHIP A CAKE
THAT BIG,
OR DOES SOMEBODY
HAVE TO ASSEMBLE IT?
NO. YOU OPEN UP THE BOX,
AND IT'S READY TO GO.
THERE'S ONE EDIBLE SECTION
IN THE BACK.
THREE TWINKIES
AND A CAN OF FROSTING
IS ALL THEY NEED
TO FILL THAT.
THREE TWINKIES?
SO, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS?
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
SEVEN YEARS.
WE HAVE OVER $5 MILLION
IN PUBLICITY WITH OUR COMPANY.
SO, THE MAGIC QUESTION --
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
I'VE TALKED ENOUGH.
THIS YEAR,
WE'VE DONE $150,000 IN SALES.
THAT'S IT?
WE DID A GROSS PROFIT
OF $76,000.
$150,000 IN SALES
AFTER 7 YEARS?
WE JUST LEARNED
SOMETHING HERE.
AFTER SEVEN YEARS,
IT'S CLEAR TO ME
THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT
A FAKE CAKE AT THEIR WEDDING.
EXACT OPPOSITE.
SEE, BUT
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
AFTER SEVEN YEARS, WHAT WE HAVE
BUILT IS AN IDEA AND A BRAND.
YOU HAVEN'T BUILT ANYTHING.
IN THE WEDDING INDUSTRY,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A PIMPLE
ON A TEENAGER. YOU'RE NOTHING.
FOR RIGHT NOW.
AND THE BIG THING
HAS BEEN --
SEVEN YEARS.
YOU'RE SEVEN YEARS IN.
RIGHT.
Koray: I MEAN, WHEN WE GOT ON
THE "TODAY" SHOW,
IT WAS MORE ABOUT,
"LOOK AT THESE CRAZY PEOPLE.
THEY HAVE THIS OBSCENE IDEA
TO RENT CAKES."
WHO CARES? YOU KEEP GOING BACK
TO THE PUBLICITY.
YOU SEEM
VERY PROUD OF THAT.
I'M JUST EXPLAINING
THAT WE'VE HAD THAT.
BUT YOU SEEM
VERY PROUD OF IT.
OH, OF COURSE I AM.
AND IT'S TURNED INTO NOTHING.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
BELIEVE ME, WE WOULDN'T
COME IN FRONT OF YOU
WITH SUCH A FABULOUS IDEA
AND ONLY $150,000 IN SALES...
O'Leary: OKAY, KIMBERLY.
...AND EXPECT YOU TO --
LET ME ASK A QUESTION.
GO AHEAD, FINISH.
WHAT'S GONNA CHANGE?
WHAT IS MISSING?
LET HER FINISH.
Kimberly: SO, WE HAVE A SET
OF 200 GROCERY STORES IN CHICAGO
THAT ARE SIGNING UP WITH US.
Greiner: WHICH ONE?
JEWEL-OSCO. AND, SO, THEY'RE
GONNA BE CARRYING OUR CAKES.
THEY'RE GONNA SELL THEM
AND MATCH THEM
WITH THEIR SHEET CAKES.
SO, A BRIDE
CAN NOW COME IN,
GET A THREE-TIERED, FAKE CAKE,
TWO SHEET CAKES --
ABOUT 200 BUCKS,
SHE'S SET TO GO.
KORAY, WE NEVER EVEN ASKED
HOW MUCH THEY ARE
COMPARED TO REAL CAKES.
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE RENTAL?
SAY THE BROOCH ONE.
THAT'S A THREE-TIERED CAKE.
Herjavec:
HOW MUCH IS THAT TO RENT?
$150 WOULD BE
THE OVERALL RENTAL.
WHAT WOULD THAT CAKE COST
IF IT WAS REAL?
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
$1,200 TO MAKE THAT.
REALLY?
Corcoran: AMAZING.
Cuban: HOW LONG DOES
THE WEDDING PARTY GET TO KEEP IT
BEFORE THEY HAVE TO
SEND IT BACK?
Herjavec:
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
THEY SHIP IT BACK ON MONDAY
AFTER THE WEDDING.
YOUR TURNAROUND
IS LESS THAN A WEEK.
Koray: YEP.
OKAY. AND, SO,
HOW MANY DIFFERENT CAKES
DO YOU HAVE IN INVENTORY?
ABOUT 150.
OUT OF THE 150, HOW MANY
MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE REVENUE?
Kimberly: PROBABLY HALF.
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT --
IT'S THE GROCERY STORES.
O'Leary: STAYING ON THE NUMBERS
FOR A MINUTE,
YOU'RE TELLING ME IF I GIVE YOU
$285,000, I GET 25%.
THAT'S A $1.1 MILLION VALUE
FOR A FAKE, FOAM CAKE.
YES, SIR.
THAT IS THE NORM
IN JAPAN.
Herjavec:
YOU KNOW, MOST SMALL BUSINESSES
MOST SMALL BUSINESSES
DON'T GET SOLD TIMES REVENUE.
ESPECIALLY NOT SEVEN YEARS IN.
YOU'RE NOT AN I --
YOU'RE NOT AN I.P. COMPANY.
YOU DON'T OWN
ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
WHAT ARE YOUR EARNINGS?
ON $150,000...
THEY SAID.
...WHAT DID YOU MAKE LAST YEAR?
NO, THEY DIDN'T.
$76,000
WAS OUR GROSS PROFIT.
WE PAID OURSELVES
A NET INCOME OF $17,000.
SO, YOU MADE $17,000
ON $150,000.
YES.
MM-HMM.
YEP.
Greiner: LET ME JUST SAY THIS.
FIRST OF ALL, FAKE AND CAKE
SHOULD NOT GO TOGETHER --
FOR ME.
I WANT REAL CAKE.
THE OTHER THING IS...
YOU <i>ARE</i> HAVING REAL CAKE
IN SHEET CAKE.
...AT A WEDDING...
...I DON'T WANT MY "SOMETHING
BORROWED" TO BE MY CAKE.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
GUYS, I THINK
IT'S A BRILLIANT PRODUCT.
YOU GUYS HAVE 150 CAKES
IN INVENTORY.
THAT MEANS
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL
EVERY WEEKEND
TO MAKE $22,000,
50 WEEKS A YEAR, A MILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR MINIMUM,
AND YOU GUYS DID
10% OF THAT AT MOST.
YOU GUYS
ARE NOT GRINDERS.
YOU GUYS
AREN'T OUT THERE
MAKING THIS
EVERYTHING THAT CONSUMES YOU.
I'M OUT.
NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND
YOUR REVENUE,
LET ME MAKE AN OBSERVATION.
PEOPLE THAT ARE
GETTING MARRIED,
HOPING TO STAY IN LOVE
FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME,
DON'T WANT A FAKE CAKE.
WHAT THIS DOES
IS ACTUALLY CAUSES DIVORCE.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
[ GASPS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, THE ISSUE --
I THINK WHEN YOU TELL
YOUR BRIDE, OR VICE VERSA,
"HONEY, THIS CAKE IS FAKE
JUST LIKE OUR LOVE."
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THAT'S WHY --
THAT'S WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING.
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT
RENTING THESE FAKE CAKES --
BECAUSE YOU
ARE AGAINST LOVE...
[ LAUGHTER ]
...NOT JUST MONEY.
AND SO, FOR THE SAKE OF
ALL OF THE MARRIAGES COMING UP,
I'M OUT
WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.
Herjavec: LOOK, I --
HERE'S THE FIRST THING
YOU GUYS NEED TO DO IF YOU'RE
GONNA STAY IN BUSINESS --
YOU NEED SOMEBODY ON YOUR TEAM
WHO KNOWS NUMBERS.
YOUR GRASP OF THE FINANCIAL PART
OF THE BUSINESS
IS -- IS REALLY LOOSE.
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR NUMBERS, YOU'RE...
YOU'RE JUST ON YOUR WAY
TO BANKRUPTCY,
AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT.
UH, I'M OUT.
IS ANYBODY LEFT?
SO, BARBARA,
THAT ONLY LEAVES YOU.
I HAPPEN TO THINK
YOUR IDEA IS EXTREMELY CLEVER,
AND NEEDED, BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU.
I WAS SHOCKED
TO HEAR THE COST...
DEFINITELY.
...OF A WEDDING CAKE.
DEFINITELY.
AND I WAS ABOUT
TO LEAVE MY SECOND HUSBAND
AND BE REMARRIED,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT
BECAUSE THE CAKES
ARE TOO EXPENSIVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THERE'S TWO PARTS
TO EVERY BUSINESS.
IT'S THE BUSINESS
AND THE ENTREPRENEUR.
I THINK IT'S A CLEVER IDEA.
THAT BEING SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE TWO OF YOU WORKED LAST YEAR
FOR $17,000 COMBINED.
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
I THINK THAT
WE SEE THE FUTURE IN IT.
AND BECAUSE
WE HAD GONE TO --
AFTER 7 YEARS, $17,000.
YOU'RE FINALLY SEEING THE FUTURE
AFTER SEVEN YEARS.
THAT DOESN'T SAY TO ME,
"I'VE GOT ENTREPRENEURS
THAT ARE HUNGRY TO RUN."
I DON'T TRUST YOU,
THAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE FINISH LINE.
JUST TO SHOW THAT WE'RE
WILLING TO CHANGE, WE'RE
WILLING TO LEARN --
DONE. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
NOT A BUSINESS, IT'S A HOBBY.
Kimberly:
IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS.
WE'RE USED TO
PEOPLE NOT GETTING IT.
BUT ONCE THEY GET IT,
THEY LOVE IT.
A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE
CAN PUT YOU DOWN,
BUT AS AN ENTREPRENEUR,
YOU GOT TO KEEP PUSHING BACK UP
AND KEEP GOING.
"HONEY, I LOVE YOU. HERE'S
THE LITTLE SECRET DOOR
WITH THE TWINKIE IN IT."
LOOK, ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT,
THE PROBLEM
WASN'T THE BUSINESS,
IT WAS THE ENTREPRENEURS.
OH, I THINK
THE BUSINESS SUCKS, TOO.
