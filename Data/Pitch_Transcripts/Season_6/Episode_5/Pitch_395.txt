HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JOSH HARBOUR.
AND I'M DIANA HARBOUR.
AND WE ARE FROM ATHENS, GEORGIA.
OUR COMPANY
IS THE RED DRESS BOUTIQUE.
WE ARE SEEKING $600,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
THE RED DRESS BOUTIQUE
IS ONE OF THE FASTEST-GROWING
ONLINE WOMEN'S RETAILERS
IN THE COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A PERSONAL TOUCH
THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN BEAT.
I AM ALWAYS FINDING NEW
AND UPCOMING DESIGNERS,
AND WE [CHUCKLES]
UPDATE OUR COLLECTIONS DAILY.
WE CATER TO THE WOMAN THAT WANTS
TO LOOK LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.
BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE
A MILLION BUCKS.
ROUGHLY 80% OF OUR MERCHANDISE
RETAILS FOR UNDER $50.
SOMETIMES ALL A WOMAN NEEDS
IS THAT ONE FANTASTIC NEW OUTFIT
TO TURN A BAD DAY
INTO A GOOD ONE,
TO GIVE A WOMAN
THE CONFIDENCE SHE NEEDS
GOING INTO AN INTERVIEW
OR TO GIVE THAT STAY-AT-HOME MOM
A REASON TO SMILE
AFTER THAT RARE MOMENT
SHE TREATS HERSELF.
AND WE HAVE SOME TREATS
FOR YOU.
Cuban: YAY.
GOOD.
Herjavec: WE LIKE TREATS.
Diana: WE FIGURED YOU WOULD.
I LOVE THAT DRESS.
THAT DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST?
$52.
WHAT?
YES.
John: WOW.
AND ABBY'S DRESS IS $40.
Greiner: I WANT IT.
Herjavec:
THANK YOU.
NOW, THIS IS HOW WE PACKAGE
EVERY SINGLE ORDER
THAT GOES OUT TO OUR CUSTOMERS
AT RED DRESS.
IT IS LITERALLY A PRESENT
TO THE CUSTOMERS.
WE PUT A HANDWRITTEN
THANK-YOU NOTE IN EVERY ORDER.
THANK YOU.
[ THUD ]
OH, MY. JEWELRY FELL OUT.
JEWELRY IS IN THERE, TOO,
MATCHED TO YOUR OUTFIT.
BASICALLY, THAT IS WHAT
A RED DRESS WOMAN SHOPS FOR.
IF SHE'S COMING TO THE SITE,
SHE HAS LITTLE TO NO TIME
TO SHOP FOR HERSELF.
WE PAIR IT AND MATCH IT
AS AN OUTFIT.
BUT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING THESE
COLLECTED TOGETHER.
RIGHT. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY
HOW THE CUSTOMER --
SO YOU'RE CURATING THE LOOK
OF THIS PERSON.
I AM CURATING THE LOOK.
IF I WAS TO SELECT THIS,
WOULD IT AUTOMATICALLY SUGGEST
THAT I BUY THE REST OF THIS?
IT WOULD.
DIANA, WHAT IS THE AVERAGE BUY
FROM A WOMAN ONLINE?
$75 PER ORDER.
PER -- PER PURCHASE?
PER PURCHASE.
PER PURCHASE.
AND HOW OFTEN
DO THEY RE-ORDER
THROUGHOUT
A 12-MONTH PERIOD?
WE HAVE A LOT
OF RETURN CUSTOMERS
THAT ORDER, ON AVERAGE,
ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN TIMES A YEAR.
WE ALSO HAVE -- WE'RE GETTING
NEW CUSTOMERS ALL THE TIME.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR?
$8 MILLION
IN GROSS SALES.
Cuban: GOOD FOR YOU.
AND WE'RE ON TARGET
TO DO $12 MILLION
TO $15 MILLION THIS YEAR.
WOW.
HOW LONG YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?
THE WEBSITE'S ONLY 4.
FOUR YEARS?
4 YEARS OLD.
WOW.
WHAT ARE THE SALES
THE FIRST YEAR?
2010, VERY MODEST,
$80,000.
2011, $250,000.
2012, $1.8 MILLION.
WHAT WAS 113?
113 WAS $7.5 MILLION.
WHAT WILL SALES BE
THIS YEAR?
PROJECTING $12 MILLION
TO $15 MILLION.
WELL, WE'RE DOING
$1 MILLION A MONTH.
I'M REALLY PROUD
OF RED DRESS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S A REALLY FUN STORY,
BECAUSE WE WERE MARRIED
FOR SIX MONTHS.
AND GRO--
WE'RE FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE
AND WE WERE WORKING
CUBICLE JOBS
AT A CREDIT-CARD-PROCESSING
COMPANY.
AND I CAME UP WITH THE RED DRESS
IN THE CUBICLE,
AND I WENT TO JOSH
AND I SAID,
"I HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA
FOR A BOUTIQUE
AND I KNOW I CAN DO THIS."
SO WE BOTH ENDED UP QUITTING
OUR CUBICLE JOBS, AGE 24,
SOLD OUR HOUSE,
TOOK OUT A SIX-FIGURE LOAN
WE HAD NO IDEA
IF WE COULD EVER REPAY.
AND WE RENTED AN AIR MATTRESS
AND SHACKED UP
WITH RA-- JOSH'S COLLEGE BUDDIES
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.
HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS GROW
SO BIG SO FAST AND ALL ONLINE?
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
IT'S BECAUSE I INVITE PEOPLE IN.
I PUT THE QUESTION
TO MY CUSTOMERS --
I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT MADE Y'ALL COME TO ME?
WHAT MAKES US --
WHAT MAKES RED DRESS SPECIAL?"
AND THEY GAVE
AMAZING ANSWERS
AND SAID, "OH,
IT'S THE COLORFUL CLOTHES."
"IT'S THE FACT THAT WE CAN GET
A HIGH-END LOOK FOR UNDER $50."
"IT'S --"
SO, YOU LEARNED FROM THEM.
YES.
YOU USED SOCIAL MEDIA...
I DID.
...AND YOU KEPT PERFECTING YOUR
BUSINESS WITH THEIR ANSWERS.
I DID. I DEVELOPED A PROGRAM
CALLED BUY FOR THE BOUTIQUE.
AND WHEN I GO TO MY MARKETS --
I GO EVERY THREE WEEKS.
I GO TO LOS ANGELES,
I GO TO VEGAS,
I GO TO ATLANTA,
AND I CURATE.
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
I SEE ITEMS,
AND I WILL TAKE A PICTURE OF IT
WITH MY PHONE,
AND I WILL THROW IT OUT
INTO SOCIAL MEDIA AND SAY,
"DO YOU LOVE THIS?
YES OR NO?
"DO YOU WANT IT IN RED?
OHH.
"DO YOU WANT IT IN BLUE?"
VERY, VERY CLEVER.
OKAY.
AND NO ONE HAD EVER DONE THAT
BEFORE, AND THEY LOVED IT.
IT WAS ALL WORD OF MOUTH
GAVE YOU A 4X GROWTH?
YES.
WE HAVE 127,000
INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS.
WE ARE JUST SHY OF A MILLION
FOLLOWERS ON FACEBOOK --
ORGANIC FOLLOWERS.
YOU WENT FROM $1.8 MILLION
TO $7.5 MILLION.
THAT'S PHENOMENAL.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
IN THAT TIME PERIOD?
YES.
MY DAD ACTUALLY DIED
IN OCTOBER OF 2012.
OH, I'M SORRY.
MY DAD WAS THE PERSON
WHO GOT ME STARTED ON RED DRESS
JUST BY BEING A MENTOR.
AND SO I TOOK MY GRIEF
AND I USED IT AS FUEL
TO PUSH RED DRESS AS FAR
AS I COULD GET IT TO GO.
THAT'S MY MOTIVATOR.
AND THAT'S A MOTIVATOR
THAT WOULD DIE WITH ME,
BECAUSE I LIVE EVERY DAY
TO KEEP MAKING HIM PROUD.
HE CALLED ME HIS ACORN.
Greiner: AWW.
O'Leary:
SO, ON THAT $13 MILLION,
HOW MUCH FREE CASH
ARE YOU GOING TO NET?
PROBABLY $2 MILLION
IN NET PROFIT.
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT COSTS YOU
TO GET A NEW CUSTOMER?
WE'VE JUST NOW STARTED TO GET
INTO REALLY THOROUGH ANALYTICS,
AND IT TAKES TIME
TO ACCRUE THAT DATA.
SO YOU'VE HAD
THIS PHENOMENAL GROWTH
ON WORD OF MOUTH
AND VIRAL ASPECTS.
YES.
WHEN YOU GET TO, YOU KNOW,
$10 MILLION
AND YOU WANT TO GET
TO $20 MILLION...
MM-HMM.
...YOU'RE GONNA
START TO COMPETE
WITH SOME PRETTY HEAVY HITTERS
IN THIS SPACE.
YES, WE ARE.
THEY'RE SPENDING
A LOT OF MONEY
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE INCREMENTAL COST
OF EVERY NEW CUSTOMER
AND THE LIFETIME VALUE.
WE'VE JUST NOW STARTED ROLLING
OUT THE RE-TARGETING ADS.
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT
HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT FOR US.
AND WE'RE JUST NOW GETTING BACK
THE DATA ON THAT.
I'D LIKE TO DRAW
AN ANALOGY.
THERE'S A GREAT STORY IN FASHION
AROUND VIDAL SASSOON,
WHO WAS THE FIRST TO CURATE HAIR
FOR WOMEN.
BUT WHEN THEY TRIED
TO EXPAND,
THEY FOUND OUT THAT
THEY COULDN'T CLONE HIM.
AND HE TRIED TO TRAIN PEOPLE
IN EVERY CITY TO DO THIS,
AND THEY HAD
HORRIFIC PROBLEMS.
I'M VERY WORRIED HERE.
TO ME, THE ROAD AHEAD IS --
IS ONE
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FACE
THE SAME ISSUE SASSOON FACED.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
CLONE YOURSELF,
AND IT'S NOT EASY TO DO.
IT'S NOT EASY TO DO,
BUT I HAVE STARTED THE PROCESS.
TO ME, THAT'S A RISK
THAT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE.
I'M OUT.
KEVIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU.
I'M EXTREMELY
IMPRESSED BY YOU.
YOU CALLED YOURSELF
AN ACORN,
AND I SEE YOU'VE GROWN INTO,
LIKE, A MOUNTAIN FULL OF TREES.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
AND WHAT YOU DID
WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, TO ME,
JUST IS MIND-BOGGLING
AND INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
I ACTUALLY COULD LEARN FROM <i>YOU</i>
IN THE SOCIAL-MEDIA REALM
OF HOW YOU HAVE GROWN
YOUR BUSINESS.
BUT I THINK THAT I'M NOT
THE RIGHT SHARK FOR YOU
TO DRIVE THIS BUSINESS.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, THIS REMINDS ME
OF THE WAY I STARTED WITH FUBU.
I WAS JUST TALKING DIRECTLY
TO THE CUSTOMER,
AND NOBODY ELSE
KNEW HOW TO DO IT.
AND THAT'S HOW I GOT HERE.
YOU GUYS ARE THE FUBU
OF YOUR CATEGORY.
I'M -- PROBABLY LIKE LORI,
I'D BE LEARNING FROM YOU.
YOU'RE HERE
FOR A STRATEGIC PARTNER.
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,
BUT I CAN'T.
SO I'M OUT.
WHY DO YOU NEED $600,000?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
MARK, YOU'VE SAID
IN INTERVIEWS
THAT Y-YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE NEEDED BUT NOT NECESSARY.
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WHO CAN HELP US
WALK THROUGH THE HIGH --
SOME HIGH-LEVEL DECISIONS
TO GET US TO THAT NEXT LEVEL,
BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF YOU
IS HERE RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE, AT SOME POINT,
YOU TOOK A SMALL COMPANY
AND YOU SCALED IT
TO A MASSIVE COMPANY.
WE HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GROW
A COMPANY FROM NOTHING
TO OVER $1 MILLION A MONTH
IN SALES.
BUT GETTING
TO NINE FIGURES A YEAR,
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.
Diana: IT TAKES A MENTOR
WHO'S WALKED THE PATH BEFORE US.
AND THE $600,000, WE NEED
$300,000 OF IT FOR A NEW WEBSITE
BECAUSE WE HAVE ACTUALLY
MAXED OUT THE CAPACITY
OF THE OUT-OF-THE-BOX SYSTEM
THAT WE HAVE.
AND A BACK-END SYSTEM
FOR OUR WEBSITE.
IT REALLY IS GIVING US NOT VERY
GOOD BUSINESS DATA AT ALL.
Herjavec: THAT'S MY WORLD.
ANALYTICS,
ENTERPRISE TYPE OF INFORMATION,
THAT'S WHERE I LIVE
EVERY DAY.
TO BE HONEST,
THAT'S WHERE I'M WEAK.
WELL, THAT -- THAT'S WHERE
I'M VERY, VERY STRONG.
I THINK I CAN ADD A LOT OF VALUE
ON THE BACK END,
WHICH IS WHAT I THINK
YOU NEED RIGHT NOW.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $600,000
FOR 15%.
FIRST OF ALL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT'S A HUGE GESTURE OF FAITH
IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.
RIGHT NOW, I THINK 15%
IS A LITTLE MORE EQUITY
THAN WE WERE PLANNING ON
GIVING UP FOR THAT VALUATION.
RESPECTFULLY,
WE DO HAVE TO DECLINE THAT.
RESPECTFULLY,
I'M GONNA STAY THERE.
THANK YOU.
I LOVE YOU GUYS, RIGHT?
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS GREAT.
AND IF YOU CAN COME UP
WITH A WAY TO AUTOMATE THIS
SO YOU CAN SCALE,
THEN YOU GUYS ARE GOING PUBLIC,
YOU'RE --
YOU'RE A $100 MILLION COMPANY,
AND YOU'RE --
YOU'RE CHANGING THE GAME.
Diana: YES.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
IS FAIR EQUITY?
JUST TELL ME, AND I'LL JUST
GIVE YOU A YES OR A NO.
AS FAR AS
EQUITY PERCENTAGE?
YEAH, FOR THE 600K.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
MARK HAS ASKED DIANA AND JOSH
TO MAKE HIM A BETTER OFFER
THAN THE $600,000 FOR 5%
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY SEEKING
FOR THEIR ONLINE FASHION SHOP,
RED DRESS BOUTIQUE.
FOR $600,000...
I -- WE WOULD GO
AS HIGH AS 10%.
$600,000 FOR 10%
IS WHAT YOU WOULD GO.
Herjavec:
THIS IS MY SPACE, MAN.
Diana: ROBERT, IF --
AT THE NUMBERS WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT WITH MARK,
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
GOING IN TOGETHER?
ROBERT,
WOULD YOU COUNTER?
LOOK, IF YOU'D RATHER
HAVE ROBERT, I'M FINE.
Diana: NO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SAYING.
TWO SHARKS
IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN ONE.
TWO -- TWO MINDS
THAT ARE BRILLIANT.
IT'S JUST NOT -- YEAH,
IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH EQUITY...
RIGHT. UNDERSTOOD.
...ONCE YOU GET --
YEAH. THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH
SKIN IN THE GAME.
WHAT ABOUT $1.2 MILLION
FOR 20%?
MARK CAN TAKE THE 10%.
I'LL TAKE THE 10%.
THAT WAY WE HAVE
THE SAME AMOUNT OF EQUITY.
I WOULD DO THAT.
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER?
Cuban: YEAH.
$1.2 MILLION FOR 20%.
$1.2 MILLION FOR 20%.
EACH OF US WILL PUT UP 600K.
YES.
YES.
YES.
YES.
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT.
DEAL.
Greiner:
AND I WANT THAT DRESS.
[ LAUGHS ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH, I'M SO SERIOUS.
ALL THE BUSINESS YOU'VE DONE
IS, LIKE...
Herjavec: WOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU, MARK.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH. GOOD JOB.
GOOD JOB, MR. CUBAN.
YES, SIR. IT'LL BE FUN.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANKS.
Josh: THIS MEANS
THAT THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
Diana: MARK AND ROBERT
ARE ANGEL INVESTORS.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.
AND ANGELS
CAN GIVE YOU WINGS.
AND WITH WINGS,
YOU CAN FLY.

[ GROWLING ]
Carbone: SINCE "SHARK TANK,"
OUR COMPANY HAS EXPLODED.
WE'RE FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS.
IN OUR FIRST YEAR OF BUSINESS,
WE DID ABOUT $400,000
IN REVENUE.
SINCE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH MARK,
WE'VE ACTUALLY SURPASSED
$2 MILLION IN REVENUE
AND ARE PLANNING TO DO BETWEEN
$3 MILLION AND $4 MILLION
IN REVENUE IN THE NEXT YEAR.
WHEN I WAS ON "SHARK TANK"
A YEAR AGO,
OUR COMPANY WAS KNOWN FOR
THE LOS ANGELES HAUNTED HAYRIDE.
NOW WE'RE ON TOUR
ACROSS THE NATION
WITH OUR NEWEST ATTRACTION,
THE GREAT HORROR CAMPOUT.
THE GREAT HORROR CAMPOUT
IS AN OVERNIGHT, 12-HOUR,
COMPLETELY INTERACTIVE
HORROR CAMPING ADVENTURE.
IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT THAT SENDS
YOU DIVING INTO CADAVER BODIES
WHERE YOU MAY HAVE TO
BREAK RIBS, CLIP OFF FINGERS.
[ GROWLS ]
THERE ARE CHUPACABRAS
AND MOTHMEN AND DEMONS
AND PSYCHOPATHIC CLOWNS
WAITING TO MEET YOU.
WHOO!
[ HIGH-PITCHED SCREECH ]
ARE WE STOKED?
All: YES.
ALL RIGHT. YEAH.
WORKING WITH MARK
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.
HE INTRODUCED US TO THE C.E.O.
OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY,
LIVE NATION, AND THEY LIKED
OUR CONCEPT SO MUCH
THAT THEY INVESTED IN US, TOO.
ALL SUMMER LONG
TO GET TO THIS POINT
AND TO GET TO THIS CAST.
SINCE "SHARK TANK,"
OUR WHOLE CAST AND CREW
HAS TRIPLED TO ALMOST 1,000.
WITH MARK AND LIVE NATION
ON OUR TEAM,
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING US
FROM BECOMING THE BIGGEST NAME
IN HORROR
AND LIVE ENTERTAINMENT.
I AM BEYOND THANKFUL
FOR MY "SHARK TANK" EXPERIENCE.
IT HAS GIVEN ME AN AWESOME
PARTNER, AMAZING RESOURCES,
AND THE ABILITY
TO BUILD THE COMPANY
I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IN MY HEAD.
[ ALL ROAR ]
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A FUN SPIN
ON A CLASSIC ACCESSORY.
HI. I'M DAN.
