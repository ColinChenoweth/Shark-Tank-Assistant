I'M RACHEL McMURTREY.
AND I'M STEVE McMURTREY.
AND WE ARE
THE PROUD OWNERS OF...
THE JUNGLE JUMPAROO.
THE JUNGLE JUMPAROO.
A BETTER WAY TO BOUNCE.
WE ARE ASKING FOR $100,000
FOR 20% EQUITY OF OUR COMPANY.
OUR TOY
IS BOTH UNIQUE AND FUN,
AND THERE'S NOTHING
ON THE MARKET LIKE IT.
TO SHOW YOU HOW FUN IT IS,
LET'S SEE IT IN ACTION.
COME ON, KIDS.
COME ON, GUYS.
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON! WHOO!
COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.
YEAH! WHOO-HOO!
John: SHE GETTING SOME AIR.
LOOK AT THAT.
YEAH!
Steve: LET'S SEE
HOW HIGH YOU CAN JUMP.
HEY!
WHO CAN JUMP THE HIGHEST?
WHOO!
WHOO-HOO!
WHOA.
YEAH!
LOOKS REALLY FUN.
THAT'S A BROKEN ANKLE
WAITING TO HAPPEN.
ALL RIGHT, KIDS.
LET'S BOUNCE ON OUT OF HERE.
AAH!
YEAH, COME ON. LET'S BOUNCE.
RUN, RUN, RUN.
[ LAUGHS ]
AWW.
Rachel: [ LAUGHS ]
THE JUNGLE JUMPAROO
IS THE SAFER WAY TO BOUNCE.
WITH STRONG,
STURDY POLES,
KIDS GET THE SENSE OF FLYING IN
THE AIR WITHOUT LOSING CONTROL.
Steve:
IT'S A JUMP/SWING/CLIMB TOY.
IT'S PERFECT FOR ALL 365 DAYS
OUT OF THE YEAR,
ALL SEASONS,
INSIDE OR OUTSIDE YOUR HOME,
AND IT COMES
IN TWO SIZES.
WHO WANTS TO JUMP ON BOARD
THIS TOTALLY TUBULAR OPPORTUNITY
WITH US?
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
Rachel: A FARMER 30 YEARS AGO
MADE ONE FOR HIS GRANDKIDS,
AND HE SOLD A FEW TO, YOU KNOW,
PRESCHOOLS AND LOCAL PLACES.
SO MY PARENTS
ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE.
I GREW UP
JUMPING ON THE ORIGINAL.
THEN YEARS PASSED BY.
ALL OF US KIDS WANTED ONE
NOW THAT WE HAVE FAMILIES.
WE CONTACTED THE FARMER,
AND, SADLY, HE HAD PASSED AWAY.
WE ENDED UP MANUFACTURING IT
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD.
AND YOU OWN
THE RIGHTS TO IT?
YES.
WE OWN THE FULL RIGHTS.
SO YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON THE BOUNCY, ROUND THING?
WE HAVE A PROVISIONAL
THAT'S FILED.
WE HAVE A UTILITY AND DESIGN
THAT ARE ALSO PENDING.
AND HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY'S
IN THIS?
Rachel:
WE HAVE PUT $144,000 CASH --
WE HAVE NO DEBT...
WOW.
GOOD FOR YOU.
...OF OUR OWN
PERSONAL MONEY.
GOOD FOR YOU.
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN
A $70,000 SALARY.
IS THIS
YOUR FULL-TIME JOBS?
Rachel: FULL TIME.
THIS IS ALL WE DO.
WE ACTUALLY MOVED.
WE DRINK, SLEEP,
AND EAT THE JUMPAROO.
WE MOVED FOR OUR BUSINESS.
IT'S ALL WE DO.
O'Leary:
I THINK IT LOOKS DANGEROUS.
I CAN TELL YOU THIS --
WE HAD A TRAMPOLINE GROWING UP.
WE HAD A JUMPAROO,
AND WE HAD KIDS
COMING OVER CONSTANTLY
BECAUSE OF THESE TWO ITEMS.
WE HAD PLENTY OF ACCIDENTS
ON THE TRAMPOLINE.
EVERY YEAR,
105,000 KIDS GO TO THE E.R.
DUE TO TRAMPOLINE INJURIES.
TRUE.
AND WHAT'S THE RECORD
ON JUMPAROOS?
NO ONE IN 30 YEARS
EVER GOT HURT ON IT.
IT'S -- IT'S A --
WELL, THEN THAT JUST MEANS
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ENOUGH.
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
[ LAUGHS ]
OKAY. SO, WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS,
AND WE HAVE SOLD
1,200 UNITS.
OKAY.
OUT OF THOSE 1,200 UNITS,
WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE CLAIM.
WHAT WAS THE PRICE
YOU SOLD THEM AT?
THE BIG ONE RETAILS FOR $399
ON OUR WEBSITE,
AND THE SMALL ONE
RETAILS FOR $249.
ARE YOU SELLING
IN RETAILERS?
RIGHT NOW, WE TRAVEL AROUND
DIFFERENT SAM'S CLUB LOCATIONS.
WE'RE THERE FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD
OF TIME, USUALLY 11 DAYS --
YOU'RE DOING A ROAD SHOW.
Rachel: YES.
WE'RE DOING THE ROAD SHOW
WITH SAM'S CLUB.
SO, STEVE, 1,200 UNITS
YOU'VE SOLD IN 12 MONTHS.
CORRECT.
HOW MANY OF THOSE
WERE THROUGH SAM'S CLUB,
AND HOW MANY DID YOU SELL
OTHER WAYS?
Steve: GREAT QUESTION.
WE'VE SOLD 60 TOTAL
THROUGH SAM'S CLUB.
WE WERE --
Herjavec: 60 UNITS?
60. WE WERE IN THERE
FOR THREE WEEKS,
AND WE SOLD OUT
OF PRODUCT.
OKAY.
ONE QUESTION I HAVE
IS ALWAYS,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A PRODUCT
IN A RETAIL STORE,
SIZE OF THE PRODUCT.
IT'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM, BECAUSE
IF THEY COULD SELL 50 THINGS
IN THAT ONE SPACE
INSTEAD OF ONE THING,
THEY'RE GONNA GO
WITH THE 50.
Steve: YEAH.
IS THIS K.D.-ABLE --
WHICH MEANS KNOCKED DOWN --
SO THAT YOUR BOX IS SMALL?
THE BOX IS 80 INCHES LONG,
20 INCHES WIDE,
AND 5 INCHES THICK,
AND SO --
SO THEY DON'T BREAK DOWN,
THOSE POLES?
THEY DON'T --
THE POLES DO NOT BREAK DOWN
CURRENTLY.
SO...
THAT -- THAT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY BIG CHALLENGE.
IT IS.
BECAUSE LET'S SAY
YOU WANT TO PUT IN 20 UNITS.
YOU'RE GONNA REQUIRE
A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPACE HERE.
WE -- WE HAVE -- WE --
NOW, SOME OF THOSE CAN STORE
IN BACK IN THE WAREHOUSE...
THEY CAN.
...WHICH IS WHAT
THEY'RE PROBABLY DOING.
BUT TO BE IN TOYS "R" US?
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT
THE DISPLAY ON THE FLOOR.
Herjavec: I LOVE TOYS.
MY WIFE SAYS I'M THE OLDEST
16-YEAR-OLD SHE KNOWS.
IF I CAN PLAY WITH IT, MY KIDS
CAN PLAY WITH IT, I'LL BUY IT.
GOT TO BE HONEST,
IT DOESN'T EXCITE ME.
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S A BAD PRODUCT.
I JUST THINK MY KIDS
WOULD GET BORED WITH IT.
'CAUSE WE HAVE A TRAMPOLINE.
WE'VE USED IT FOR 10 YEARS.
Rachel: THIS IS NOT
A 15-MINUTE TOY.
IF YOU PUT --
THIS IS A FOUR-HOUR TOY.
PARENTS HAVE THE SAME EXPRESSION
YOU JUST DID
WHERE THEY LOOK AT IT
AND THEY GO...
"WHAT A DUMB IDEA."
..."I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS."
AND THEN THEY SEE THEIR KIDS
AND GO, "I GET IT."
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY,
"DUMB IDEA."
WE'VE HEARD IT ALL.
AND GUESS WHAT.
WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE PERSON
RETURN IT.
John:
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE DOING --
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CHUGGING ALONG.
YOU'RE FIGURING IT OUT, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
WHY DO YOU FEEL
YOU NEED PARTNERS?
OKAY.
WE SUBMITTED TO 100 STORES.
WE JUST MET WITH SAM'S CLUB.
WE SAT DOWN WITH THE BUYER.
HE'S VERY EXCITED
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
BUT HE ASKED US...
YEAH.
SO, WE WILL --
...TO PURCHASE 11,000 UNITS.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED
THE SHARKS.
FLAT-OUT.
BECAUSE WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT --
IF WE DO WHAT WE DID IN THE
FIRST COUPLE LOCATIONS AT SAM'S,
IF WE DO SOMETHING
SIMILAR TO THAT,
THAT'S AROUND FOUR JUMPAROOS
A DAY IN 100 LOCATIONS.
THAT IS A $1.3 MILLION
PURCHASE ORDER.
SO, RIGHT NOW YOU NEED MONEY
SO YOU CAN MANUFACTURE MORE.
WHEN I FIRST STARTED, I HAD
A LITTLE EARRING ORGANIZER,
AND JCPenney SAID TO ME,
"LORI, IF YOU CAN GET
THE CHICAGOLAND AREA TO BUY,
THEN WE'LL TAKE YOU
NATIONWIDE."
SO EVERY WEEKEND,
I WENT TO A DIFFERENT JCPenney
AND I STOOD THERE ALL DAY
DEMONSTRATING
THE SLIDING EARRING STANDS
AND SHOWING MY PRODUCT
AND PULLING PEOPLE OVER.
AND IT WAS A 12-HOUR DAY
EACH DAY.
AND I SOLD ENOUGH
AND I GOT IN.
SO THERE'S TWO OF YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO IN,
DEMONSTRATE --
BRING KIDS,
JUMP UP AND DOWN.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET 100 OF YOU?
FOR ME RIGHT NOW, I'M OUT.
THERE'S YOUR CHALLENGE,
RIGHT?
SO, A-AS -- AS A SELF-CONTAINED,
FROM-HOME BUSINESS,
THIS IS GREAT.
NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT BIG STAIR STEP.
BUT MONEY
ISN'T YOUR ONLY ISSUE,
BECAUSE ONCE
YOU'RE IN 100 STORES,
THE AGGRAVATION FACTOR
GOES THROUGH THE ROOF.
AND YOU WILL GET TO THE POINT
WHERE SOMEBODY GETS HURT.
IT'S JUST INEVITABLE.
THERE'S IDIOTS EVERYWHERE,
AND YOU CAN'T PROTECT
AGAINST SOMEONE SPRAINING
THEIR ANKLE, BREAKING AN ANKLE.
IF I'D PARTNER WITH YOU,
EVERY TIME WE SOLD ONE,
I'D HAVE TO CROSS MY FINGERS
AND CROSS MY TOES
THAT IT WASN'T MY KIDS
THAT BROKE THEIR ANKLE.
THAT'S JUST MY NATURE.
AND SO I-I DON'T SEE MYSELF
BEING A GOOD PARTNER FOR YOU,
SO I'M OUT.
THIS IS A KID MAGNET.
I DON'T THINK ANY ADULT
CAN UNDERSTAND HOW FUN IT IS
UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR KIDS
JUMPING ON IT.
AND IT IS SAFER THAN A TRAMPO--
Herjavec:
IT -- YEAH, LISTEN TO ME.
I HAVE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT
OF RESPECT
OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE AN IDEA
AND CREATE A COMPANY OUT OF IT.
BUT I GOT TO REALLY
BELIEVE IN THE PRODUCT.
I DON'T SEE THIS
TAKING OVER THE TRAMPOLINE
OR BEING A SUPPLEMENT
TO THAT BUSINESS.
SO IT JUST --
IT DOESN'T EXCITE ME THAT WAY.
I'M OUT.
WHAT EXCITES ME
IS MAKING MONEY.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE
IF THEY'RE BOUNCING UPSIDE DOWN
OR WHATEVER OR HANGING
LIKE A PRISONER IN A CAGE
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.
BUT TO REALLY SCALE THIS PUPPY,
YOU'VE GOT SOME BIG CHALLENGES
BECAUSE OF THE FLOOR SPACE,
THE FOOTPRINT OF THE PRODUCT.
I THINK THAT'LL ALWAYS LIMIT
HOW MUCH YOU CAN SELL
IN ANY ONE SEASON.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I THINK THIS TRULY
WILL TAKE A PORTION
OF THE TRAMPOLINE MARKET.
I'M GOING TO HIT A HOME RUN
WITH THIS.
AND I AM A FIGHTER
AND I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.
John: SO, RACHEL, STEVE,
I HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION.
YOU'RE MAKING IT FOR HOW MUCH,
AND HOW MUCH
ARE YOU SELLING IT FOR?
WE MANUFACTURE IT FOR $125
FOR THE LARGE ONE...
OKAY.
...AND WE'RE CUR--
AND THEN YOU'RE SELLING IT
TO SAM'S CLUB...
FOR $278.
IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE
100 STORES YOU'RE GOING INTO,
THE MARGIN
IS GONNA KILL YOU.
YOU CAME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA
OF A LOCAL PRODUCT.
YOU KNOW, WHERE I CAME FROM,
WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE A POOL,
WE JUST FILLED UP
TWO GARBAGE PAILS
AND PLAYED "MARCO POLO" IN THAT,
RIGHT?
SO, I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU
ON THAT.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
THE FINANCES DON'T WORK IN THIS
FOR YOU TO HAVE A PARTNER.
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
John: GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATS.
THANK YOU.
[ SNAPS FINGERS ]
[ CHUCKLES ]
[ GROANS ]
Steve: I'M DISAPPOINTED.
I'M FRUSTRATED
THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I REALLY FELT LIKE
THIS WAS OUR BIG OPPORTUNITY
AND OUR BIG CHANCE TO REALLY
TAKE IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL
LIKE DAYMOND TALKED ABOUT.
AND IT'S FRUSTRATING
TO HIT A WALL.
