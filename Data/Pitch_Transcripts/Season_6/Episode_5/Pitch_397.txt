AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
FIRST INTO THE TANK
ARE ENTREPRENEURS
WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE
THE NEXT BIG THING IN TOYS.
HELLO, SHARKAROOS.
HELLO, SHARKAROOS.
TO EVERY OTHER MAJOR GOLF MARKET
IN AMERICA.
WITH THE RIGHT SHARK,
I KNOW THAT MY BUSINESS
COULD BE A HOLE IN ONE.
I'M DAVE.
AND I'M ERIC.
AND WE ARE H2W,
THE CREATORS OF SUN-STACHES,
A FUN AND EXCITING
FACEWEAR COMPANY.
WE ARE SEEKING $300,000
FOR A 5% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
WHOA.
WE ALL AGREE
ON ONE THING --
YOU DON'T WAIT FOR THE PARTY
TO COME TO YOU.
YOU BRING THE PARTY.
SOME BRING FOOD,
SOME OLIVE OIL.
BUT LET'S BE REAL.
[ LAUGHS ]
THE TIMES,
THEY ARE A-CHANGING,
AND THESE OLD GEMS
NEED AN EXTREME MAKEOVER.
HOW CAN ANYONE GET A PARTY
STARTED WITH THESE?
BORING!
BORING!
BORING!
SO WE DEVELOPED
A PROPRIETARY LINE
OF THE BEST PARTY SHADES
YOU'VE EVER SEEN --
SUN-STACHES.
THEY'RE MORE
THAN JUST EYEWEAR.
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE FACEWEAR.
WE HAVE A THEME STYLE
FOR EVERY OCCASION
FROM FOURTH OF JULY TO HANUKKAH
TO SPORTING EVENTS
AND EVEN
KIDS' BIRTHDAY PARTIES.
IMAGINE THESE
IN EVERY STADIUM!
WHOO!
AND IMAGINE THESE
IN EVERY RETAILER!
HYAH!
COME JOIN OUR PARTY.
AND WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF CASH,
WE CAN MAKE A WHOLE LOT
OF 'STACHE.
Herjavec: WHOO!
ALL RIGHT.
CAN WE TRY THEM?
ABSOLUTELY.
YES.
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE
WHAT YOU THINK WE ARE.
THERE YOU GO. ROBERT,
YOU'RE GONNA BE A COWBOY.
AND FEEL FREE TO PLAY
WITH THOSE SALOON DOORS.
THEY OPEN AND CLOSE.
LORI, YOU'RE GONNA BE
A BLACK CAT FOR HALLOWEEN.
AND, MR. WONDERFUL...
O'Leary: YES.
...WE OBVIOUSLY SELECTED
THE DEVIL FOR YOU...
OH, THANK YOU.
...FOR YOUR
DEVILISHLY HANDSOME LOOKS.
AND, DAYMOND, WE GOT THE PURPLE
FOOTBALL HELMET FOR YOU.
DAYMOND, PUT IT ON!
AND, MARK, YOU'RE GONNA
TRANSFORM INTO A LEPRECHAUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
KEVIN,
LOOK OVER HERE.
YOU LOOK SO RIDICULOUS.
MARK, PUT YOURS ON.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY OF THESE?
YES. LAST YEAR, WE ACTUALLY
DID $5.7 MILLION IN SALES.
OH.
WHOO!
THAT'S NO LAUGHING MATTER.
NOT SO FUNNY ANYMORE.
HOLD ON.
OF THAT, $2.8 MILLION
IS OUR BRAND OF SUN-STACHES.
THE REST IS OUR GENERIC
PRIVATE-LABEL GOODS.
ALL SUNGLASSES, RIGHT?
ALL SUNGLASSES, YEAH.
Greiner:
DO YOU SELL TO RETAILERS?
YES. OUR -- OUR MAJOR RETAILERS
ARE PARTY CITY, TOYS "R" US.
WE'RE MAINLY
IN SPECIALTY RETAIL.
GIVE ME AN IDEA HOW MUCH
THE COWBOY SELLS FOR.
ALL OUR PRODUCTS RANGE
FROM $7.99 TO $12.99.
AT RETAIL?
CORRECT.
OUR COST IS BETWEEN 75 CENTS
AND $1.50...
[ LAUGHS ]
WOW.
...DEPENDING ON COMPLEXITY
OF THE DESIGN AND WHATNOT.
THAT IS
A REALLY GOOD MARGIN.
WE'RE ON TRACK THIS YEAR
TO DO $6.4 MILLION IN SALES.
O'Leary:
AND YOU'LL MAKE, AFTER YOU PAY
YOURSELVES A NORMALIZED SALARY,
HOW MUCH?
WE'LL MAKE A PROFIT
OF ABOUT $750,000.
WOW.
GOOD FOR YOU GUYS.
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN DOING THIS?
WE'VE BEEN DOING SUN-STACHES
SINCE 2011.
O'Leary: FIRST OF ALL,
CONGRATULATIONS.
GREAT BUSINESS,
AND YOU'VE DONE A TERRIFIC JOB
ON ALL ASPECTS OF FUNCTION.
NOW THE SOBERING REALITY.
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT THE MARKET
WOULD TELL YOU YOU'RE WORTH,
JUST SO WE CAN SEE
IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WHAT YOUR ASK WAS,
WHICH WAS $6 MILLION,
VERSUS WHAT, ON THE PLANET
EARTH, PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR YOU.
SO, FIRST OF ALL, WE DO HAVE
AN ESTABLISHED BRAND.
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS NUMBER?
OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK --
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE WORTH?
I'M NOT CHARGING YOU
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.
PLEASE. PLEASE.
SOME FREE ADVICE.
YOU'RE WORTH
ABOUT 2.5 MILLION BUCKS.
OKAY, NEXT, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
ABOUT OUR PLAN FOR 2015
AND TELL YOU WHY I THINK
WE'RE WORTH MORE THAN THAT.
I'M GIVING YOU FIVE TIMES
YOUR AFTER-TAX CASH FLOW --
EXTREMELY GENEROUS OF ME.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
WE GOT AN E-MAIL FROM TARGET
JUST SAYING,
"WE LOVE YOUR BRAND.
"WE SAW YOU IN THE MARKETPLACE,
WE WANT TO BRING YOU
IN ALL STORES."
NOW, WE ALSO
JUST GOT INTO LICENSING.
SO THIS IS HOW
WE'RE GONNA GROW.
WE WANT TO GROW TO MORE
LICENSING -- MARVEL, DC.
DAN, WHY DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY?
YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY.
YOU BRING ME TO MY POINT.
SO, I TRIED TO GET
THESE LICENSES, RIGHT?
AND I GOT, LIKE,
"NO, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED."
NOW, HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
LICENSING YOUR BUSINESS
TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS
ALL THESE PROPERTIES ALREADY?
SO, THIS IS WHERE THE IDEA OF
A STRATEGIC PARTNER COMES IN.
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S TWO MAJOR
PLAYERS IN LICENSED SPORTS,
AND BOTH OF THEM
WANT TO CARRY OUR LINE.
BUT WE KNOW IT'S GONNA
BE EXTREMELY LOW MARGIN
IF WE GO THROUGH THEM.
IF WE HAVE YOU AS A PARTNER AND
YOU SAY, "HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
"LET'S PUT THE MONEY OUT.
LET'S DO --
GET THE LICENSING OURSELVES."
WAY HIGHER -- HIGHER MARGINS,
AND WE CAN BLOW IT UP THAT WAY.
WHY -- IF YOU FEEL THAT
THAT'S THE VALUE WE ADD,
WHY DO YOU MAKE US PAY A PREMIUM
FOR IT?
WHY ARE WE PAYING YOU
TO HELP YOU?
RIGHT.
I -- TO BE FRANK WITH YOU,
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE CHARGING THAT MUCH.
AT A $6 MILLION VALUATION
AND WITH THE GROWTH STRATEGY
THAT I OUTLINED,
I DO FEEL
IT'S A FAIR VALUE.
NOBODY'S GONNA PAY YOU
MORE THAN FIVE TIMES
YOUR CASH FLOW FOR THIS.
THEY JUST WON'T.
THE ONLY MISTAKE
YOU'VE MADE
IS YOU'VE -- YOU'VE PUT
A 100% PREMIUM ON IT,
AND YET YOU WANT A SHARK SO THAT
THEY CAN ADD THEIR VALUE.
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT.
I MEAN, IT'S A --
IT'S A MISTAKE.
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT,
OBVIOUSLY.
YOU'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.
I CAN'T GET EXCITED
AND PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE.
JUST MY PERSONAL THING.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, LORI.
THANK YOU.
O'Leary: OKAY,
YOU LOST YOUR FIRST SHARK.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU RE-ADJUST
YOUR VALUE, SO I'M OUT.
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN
CONVINCE SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT YOU'RE WORTH
ANYTHING NEAR $6 MILLION.
GUYS, I-I-I...
I LOVE THE THREE OF YOU
AS OPERATORS.
VERY, VERY CLEVER DESIGN.
IT MADE ME LAUGH.
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE
WITH IT.
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH THE FUTURE.
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO
BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE,
BUT YOU CAN'T
LOVE THE FUTURE SO MUCH
THAT IT CHANGES YOUR METRICS
OF TODAY.
I REALLY WISH THAT THERE WAS
A MORE REASONABLE VALUE
THAT YOU HAD
ON THIS BUSINESS.
JUST LIKE ANY GREAT LOVE AFFAIR,
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME SENSE
OF REALITY TO IT.
I'M OUT.
YOU HAVE TWO SHARKS LEFT.
YOU SHOULD FOCUS YOUR ENERGIES
ON THEM.
W-- YOU KNOW, WE --
WE WORKED PRETTY DAMN HARD
ON THESE THINGS.
WE'VE ALWAYS DONE
EXTREMELY WELL.
NO, I -- NO ONE'S QUESTIONING
YOUR EFFORT.
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT.
Levich: AND -- AND IF YOU FEEL
THE VALUATION ISN'T RIGHT,
WE'D LOVE TO HEAR AN OFFER.
LIKE, WE --
LOVE TO HEAR AN OFFER.
W-WE WANT TO GET AN --
WE'RE HERE TO MAKE A DEAL.
WE'RE NOT HERE, YOU KNOW,
FOR ANYTHING ELSE.
WHAT'S THE BEST EQUITY
YOU WOULD OFFER FOR $300,000?
THE RIGHT NUMBER IS 20%.
SO YOU'RE ASKING US TO VALUE
OUR COMPANY AT $1.5 MILLION?
I'M GIVING YOU
FREE ADVICE.
IF YOU WERE GOING
TO A PRIVATE-EQUITY FIRM,
THEY'D ASK FOR 15%.
BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BRING
A SHARK IN, YOU PAY A PREMIUM.
THAT'S ANOTHER FIVE POINTS.
TRY 20%. MAYBE YOU GET THEM.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO
A DEAL FOR $300,000 FOR 10%?
NO.
OH, CRAZY. CRAZY.
A-A $3 MILLION VALUATION?
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER --
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER?
WELL, ACTUALLY, KEVIN, YOU SAID
IT WAS WORTH $2.5 MILLION.
AT $3 MILLION, IT DOESN'T
SEEM THAT CRAZY, DOES IT?
I SEE YOU GUYS GOING
DOWN THE TOILET RIGHT NOW,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH --
YOU'RE ABOUT LOSE EVERYTHING.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
DAYMOND AND MARK
MIGHT BE INTERESTED,
BUT THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED
EVEN THOUGH THE MAKERS
OF THE NOVELTY EYEWEAR COMPANY
SUN-STACHE
HAVE SLASHED THEIR VALUATION
FROM $6 MILLION TO $3 MILLION.
OKAY, GUYS,
YOU'VE ALREADY PROVEN
THAT YOU ARE GREAT DESIGNERS
AND YOU CAN WORK THIS OUT.
SO HERE'S WHERE I SEE IT --
I CAN HELP YOU GET
THE LICENSES YOU NEED,
ALSO GET THEM
AT REDUCED COST,
SO THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA SAVE MONEY.
BUT I NEED TO GET PAID FOR THAT,
AND I NEED 25%.
YOW!
RIGHT THERE.
Herjavec: OOH.
BINGO.
AND THAT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT
OF TIME AND A LOT OF MONEY.
DAN,
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT
THAT DAYMOND IS THE ONLY GUY
WHO MADE YOU THE OFFER.
MARK IS JUST ASKING YOU
TO NEGOTIATE AGAINST YOURSELF
AND THROW OFFERS AT HIM.
Cuban: IT'S TRUE.
O'Leary: SO...
YOU HAVE A FIRM OFFER,
AND IT'S GROUNDED IN REALITY.
ISN'T GRAVITY A BITCH?
DAYMOND,
I REALLY RESPECT YOUR OFFER,
BUT $300,000, PUTTING
OUR COMPANY AT $1.2 MILLION
WHEN WE MADE $570,000
LAST YEAR,
WE'RE ON TRACK TO MAKE $750,00
THIS YEAR --
AND YOU WILL BE ON TRACK
TO MAKE $20 MILLION AFTER THAT.
THAT VALUATION
I JUST THINK IS REALLY LOW.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
MAYBE TO GO IN WITH MARK
FOR $300,000 FOR 12.5%?
I REALLY SEE THE VISION
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.
I THINK TWO SHARKS WOULD BE
GREAT -- MARK WITH THE SPORTS.
OH, I'M CLOSING THE BOOK.
I HATE DOING THAT.
I HATE WHEN I HAVE TO
CLOSE THE BOOK.
MARK, WOULD YOU BE WILLING,
PERHAPS,
TO GO $300,000
FOR LIKE 12.5%?
GUYS, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GONNA DO 12.5%.
I'M OUT.
YOU'RE OUT.
Herjavec: ERIC, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE ODD
THAT ONE GUY MADE YOU AN OFFER
AND YOUR REBUTTAL WAS TO MARK?
DAYMOND, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO $300,000 FOR 15%?
I THINK
THAT PUTS US AT ABOUT --
DID YOU JUST OFFER MARK 12.5%
BUT DAYMOND 15%?
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.
John: WELL, HE'S SAVING HIMSELF
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S OKAY.
HE JUST -- HE JUST GAVE HIMSELF
A LITTLE BIT OF MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.
WE CAME HERE
TO MAKE A DEAL.
I WOULD NORMALLY CHARGE SOMEBODY
30% FOR MY SERVICES.
SO I'LL MEET YOU AT 20%.
AND I NEED THE ANSWER NOW, GUYS.
WE CAN'T TAKE FOREVER.
'CAUSE THAT MEANS, THEN,
YOU'RE NOT DEFINITIVE
IN REGARDS TO DECISIONS
YOU HAVE TO MAKE.
WOULD YOU DO 17%?
NO.
Gershon: DAYMOND...
LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN,
CAP'N.
ALL RIGHT.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
Gershon: THIS IS FOR YOU.
OH, THAT WAS PAINFUL.
Greiner: GOOD DEAL.
THAT WAS BRUTAL.
THANKS, MAN. WE'RE REALLY
EXCITED TO WORK WITH YOU.
THANK YOU, MAN. A'IGHT.
SO EXCITED.
THANKS, GUYS.
APPRECIATE IT.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
ENJOY THAT.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
Gershon: THANKS A LOT, GUYS.
OH, THOSE LOOK GOOD ON YOU.
Herjavec:
YEAH, THEY DO LOOK GOOD ON YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE DID IT.
WHOO!
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WHOO!
I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE HAD SOMEBODY START AT 5%
AND NEGOTIATE THEMSELVES
UP TO 20%.
THEY JUST KEPT
THROWING OUT NUMBERS.
I LIKE THEM A LOT.
I WAS READY TO GO DOWN
TO 19.5%.
SO, EVEN THOUGH
WE DIDN'T GET
THE VALUATION
WE WERE ASKING FOR,
WE GOT A SHARK, AND HE WANTS
TO BLOW UP OUR BUSINESS.
AND HE SAID IT HIMSELF -- "I'M
GONNA MAKE YOU $20 MILLION."
AND WE BELIEVE THAT.
WE BELIEVE.
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
HELL, YEAH.
YEP.
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
