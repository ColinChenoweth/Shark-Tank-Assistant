I'M MEGHAN TARMEY.
I'M FROM MYRTLE BEACH,
SOUTH CAROLINA.
NICE SHOT.
MY COMPANY IS CALLED
THE CADDY GIRLS.
IT'S THE FIRST ALL-FEMALE
GOLF-CADDYING COMPANY.
WE PROVIDE THE REFRESHING
COMPANY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
THAT IS ALSO A GREAT CADDY.
WE DRIVE THE CART,
KEEP THE SCORE,
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MEGHAN TARMEY.
I'M FROM MYRTLE BEACH,
SOUTH CAROLINA,
MEGHAN, HOW BIG
IS YOUR BUSINESS?
WHAT ARE YOUR REVENUES?
IN 2013,
I HAD $148,000 IN SALES.
GOOD FOR YOU.
GOOD.
O'Leary: THAT'S NOT BAD.
WE DID $34,000
IN SALES LAST MONTH.
WHAT'S THE MAIN BULK
OF YOUR BUSINESS?
IT COULD BE AN EVERYDAY
GOLF OUTING WITH FOUR GUYS.
IT COULD BE A HUGE GOLF OUTING
WITH 144 PLAYERS
IN A TOURNAMENT.
WE'VE HAD
HUGE CORPORATE CLIENTS
ACTUALLY HIRE UP TO 42 CADDIES
IN ONE DAY.
O'Leary:
GIVE US THE NUMBERS.
I CALL YOU UP.
I'VE GOT A CORPORATE EVENT.
MEGHAN, HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THE IDEA?
MEGHAN, TAKE THIS QUESTION
THE ABSOLUTE MOST INNOCENT WAY.
MOST GUYS ARE PIGS.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
COCHON.
WHEN THEY'RE HIRING
THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES --
I DON'T MEAN THIS
IN A DISRESPECTFUL WAY --
ARE THEY HIRING THEM FOR GOLF,
OR IS IT JUST A FUN THING?
WE ARE NOT PEOPLE TO COME
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MEGHAN, LET ME --
LET ME JUMP IN HERE.
I THINK YOU CAN TURN THIS
INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL.
BUT I HATE GOLF,
SO I'M OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE COULD MAKE YOU LIKE GOLF
A LITTLE BIT MORE.
MAYBE IF YOU HAD A CADDY GIRL
WITH YOU, YOU'D LIKE IT.
BUT, MEGHAN,
HE'S GRUMPY ALL THE TIME.
I ACTUALLY --
I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THIS PRESENTATION
WAS GOING TO BE
JUST RIDICULOUS.
50% FOR $100,000.
YOU KNOW,
ISN'T TALK CHEAP, MEGHAN?
THE ONLY SHARK THAT BELIEVED
IN YOU IS MR. WONDERFUL.
THAT'S IT.
WHICH IS...REALLY SURPRISING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT...
GOOD ANSWER.
IF YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU CAN MORE THAN DOUBLE IT,
DON'T DO THIS DEAL.
I KNOW I COULD.
THEN WHAT
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU HALF.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 40%?
NEVER.
DAMN IT.
MEGHAN, YOU GOT TO
MAKE A DECISION.
I JUST THINK, AT THIS TIME,
50% IS TOO -- TOO MUCH
FOR WHAT I'VE PUT INTO IT.
ARE YOU OFFICIALLY
DECLINING HIS OFFER?
YES.
THEN I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT A LOT.
MEGHAN, YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK, MEGHAN.
THANK YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU, LADIES.
SEE YOU GUYS.
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
I'M NOT GIVING HIM
HALF OF WHAT I HAVE.
NO.
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
HE WAS JUST
PUTTING SOMETHING --
THAT'S LIKE A DIVORCE.
YEAH.
[ ALL CHUCKLE ]
