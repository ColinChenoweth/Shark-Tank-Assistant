I'M MEGHAN TARMEY.
I'M FROM MYRTLE BEACH,
SOUTH CAROLINA.
NICE SHOT.
MY COMPANY IS CALLED
THE CADDY GIRLS.
IT'S THE FIRST ALL-FEMALE
GOLF-CADDYING COMPANY.
WE PROVIDE THE REFRESHING
COMPANY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
THAT IS ALSO A GREAT CADDY.
WE DRIVE THE CART,
KEEP THE SCORE,
TEND THE PIN, RAKE SAND TRAPS,
READ THE GREENS.
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
WE'RE YOUR PERSONAL CHEERLEADERS
TO DO BACKFLIPS
FOR WHEN YOU GET BIRDIES.
YES!
THERE WE GO!
I CAME UP WITH MY BUSINESS
BACK WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.
I LEARNED EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT GOLF
AND I STARTED CADDYING
AT ALL THE LOCAL COURSES.
THE CONCEPT
WAS AN IMMEDIATE HIT,
AND NOW I HAVE A STAFF
OF OVER 70 GIRLS,
AND WE WORK EVENTS AND
TOURNAMENTS FROM COAST TO COAST.
THE GIRLS WILL BE THERE
20 MINUTES BEFORE YOUR TEE TIME.
I AM COMPLETELY IMMERSED
IN HUSTLING EVERY SINGLE DAY
TO GET THIS COMPANY
OFF THE GROUND.
BUT THE MONEY THAT I'M MAKING
OFF OF MY COMPANY RIGHT NOW
IS NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE OFF OF
AND EXPAND MY BUSINESS.
I NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
TO TAKE THE MODEL THAT I HAVE
HERE IN MYRTLE BEACH
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MEGHAN TARMEY.
I'M FROM MYRTLE BEACH,
SOUTH CAROLINA,
AND MY COMPANY IS...
THE CADDY GIRLS.
I'M SEEKING $100,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
SO, THE CADDY GIRLS
IS AN ALL-FEMALE
GOLF-CADDYING COMPANY.
WE STAFF EVERYTHING
FROM EVERYDAY GOLF OUTINGS
TO HUGE CORPORATE
CHARITY TOURNAMENTS
WITH MY AMAZING,
GOLF-KNOWLEDGEABLE,
AND ATTRACTIVE CADDIES.
WE TRY TO EMPHASIZE
THE FUN FACTOR OF GOLF,
BUT WE ALSO MAINTAIN
A VERY PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE
ABOUT GOLF.
SHARKS, MY COMPANY
IS A HOLE IN ONE.
SO WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS GONNA HELP ME...
DRIVE MY COMPANY
TO THE GREEN?
I'M CURIOUS.
WHERE DO YOU DO THIS?
WE'RE BASED OUT OF
MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA,
BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN EXPANDING
TO OTHER MAJOR GOLF MARKETS,
SUCH AS SCOTTSDALE.
WE EVEN HAVE CADDY GIRLS NOW
IN LOS ANGELES, MIAMI, ORLANDO,
AND PARTS OF GEORGIA.
MEGHAN, HOW BIG
IS YOUR BUSINESS?
WHAT ARE YOUR REVENUES?
IN 2013,
I HAD $148,000 IN SALES.
GOOD FOR YOU.
GOOD.
O'Leary: THAT'S NOT BAD.
WE DID $34,000
IN SALES LAST MONTH.
WHAT'S THE MAIN BULK
OF YOUR BUSINESS?
IT COULD BE AN EVERYDAY
GOLF OUTING WITH FOUR GUYS.
IT COULD BE A HUGE GOLF OUTING
WITH 144 PLAYERS
IN A TOURNAMENT.
WE'VE HAD
HUGE CORPORATE CLIENTS
ACTUALLY HIRE UP TO 42 CADDIES
IN ONE DAY.
O'Leary:
GIVE US THE NUMBERS.
I CALL YOU UP.
I'VE GOT A CORPORATE EVENT.
AND I WANT TO HIRE CADDIES
FOR EVERYBODY.
THE LOWEST RATE THAT WE HAVE FOR
EACH CADDY IS $149 PER CADDY.
WELL, YOU GET $149.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU PAY THEM?
I PAY EVERY CADDY $100.
Greiner: IS THAT FOR 9 HOLES?
18 HOLES?
18 HOLES.
18 HOLES.
9 HOLES IS $89.
MEGHAN, HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THE IDEA?
I WAS, HONESTLY, IN COLLEGE
AND COMPLETELY BROKE.
I WAS BARTENDING
IN MYRTLE BEACH,
WHERE THERE'S
A HUNDRED GOLF COURSES,
AND I NOTICED
THAT I REALLY LIKED GOLFERS.
THEY TIPPED THE BEST, AND ONE
GROUP CAME UP TO ME ONE NIGHT,
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "HEY,
WE WANT YOU TO COME
GOLF WITH US TOMORROW.
WE'LL PAY YOU."
AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S WEIRD."
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT HERE'S THE THING --
A LIGHT BULB WENT OF,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE
REALLY AWESOME IF I
MAKE MY OWN SCHEDULE.
"I WANT TO BE
OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS MARKET."
MEGHAN, TAKE THIS QUESTION
THE ABSOLUTE MOST INNOCENT WAY.
MOST GUYS ARE PIGS.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
COCHON.
WHEN THEY'RE HIRING
THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES --
I DON'T MEAN THIS
IN A DISRESPECTFUL WAY --
ARE THEY HIRING THEM FOR GOLF,
OR IS IT JUST A FUN THING?
WE ARE NOT PEOPLE TO COME
AND GET HIRED TO HANG OUT
WITH GUYS, OKAY?
LIKE, OUR WHOLE NICHE
IS THAT WE ARE HOT GIRLS
THAT KNOW ABOUT GOLF.
DO YOU DO TRADITIONAL
CADDY THINGS?
YES. WE'RE GETTING YOUR CLUBS
TO AND FROM YOU.
WE'RE FIXING PITCH MARKS.
WE'RE RAKING EVERY SAND TRAP.
WE'RE TENDING THE PIN.
WE'RE HELPING YOU
GET YOUR YARDAGE.
EVERYTHING THAT A CADDY
WOULD NORMALLY DO, WE DO THAT.
WE JUST HAD FOUR OF OUR GIRLS
CONTRACTED
FOR THE PGA-SANCTIONED
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
COMING UP IN TWO WEEKS.
THAT'S GONNA BE TELEVISED.
FOUR OF MY GIRLS
ARE CARRYING BAGS.
HOW DO YOU MAKE THIS MORE THAN
A REGIONALLY BASED BUSINESS?
A STANDARD GOLF TOURNAMENT
HAS 144 PLAYERS.
THAT'S 144 PEOPLE THAT GO HOME
AND TELL THEIR GOLF BUDDIES
ABOUT IT,
AND THEN IT'S JUST --
IT SPREADS.
HALF OF OUR BUSINESS THIS YEAR
WAS REPEAT BUSINESS.
AND BIG CORPORATE TOURNAMENTS,
WE ALREADY HAVE SOME LINED UP
THROUGH DECEMBER.
AND THIS IS NOT JUST, LIKE,
ONE OR TWO GIRLS GOING OUT.
THIS IS 30 TO 40 GIRLS
GOING OUT, YOU KNOW, IN ONE DAY.
$100,000 FOR 20%.
YOU THINK THIS IS WORTH
HALF A MILLION BUCKS?
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
THE LIFETIME CUSTOMER VALUE.
GOLF ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.
THE USE OF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE
ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.
AND WE HAVE A DATABASE
OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS
THAT HAVE USED US
IN THE PAST.
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.
I HAVE 70 GIRLS WORKING,
BOOKINGS EVERY DAY.
I WANT TO TAKE THAT
AND EXPAND THAT TO OTHER PLACES.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE PEOPLE
ASKING FOR CADDIES
IN CHICAGO, MINNEAPOLIS --
ALL THESE AREAS
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO GET INTO.
Greiner:
YOU KNOW, FOR ME, I JUST SEE
SO MANY ISSUES OR PROBLEMS
THAT I COULD FORESEE HAPPENING
WITH THIS.
IT WORRIES ME SOMETIMES,
JUST FOR YOU GUYS, PERIOD,
TO BE OUT THERE WITH
THE DRINKING AND THIS AND THAT.
I -- IT'S JUST NOT A BUSINESS
I COULD GET BEHIND.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND.
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE VERY,
VERY STRICT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
FOR ALL OF OUR CADDIES.
AND I THINK WITH ANY JOB PLACE,
YOU HAVE A LIABILITY
FOR ANY KIND OF HARASSMENT
OR ANYTHING THAT CAN GO ON.
IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MEGHAN, LET ME --
LET ME JUMP IN HERE.
I THINK YOU CAN TURN THIS
INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL.
BUT I HATE GOLF,
SO I'M OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE COULD MAKE YOU LIKE GOLF
A LITTLE BIT MORE.
MAYBE IF YOU HAD A CADDY GIRL
WITH YOU, YOU'D LIKE IT.
THIS IS SUPER FUN.
Cuban: I CAN THINK OF
A HUNDRED THOUSAND THINGS
I WOULD RATHER DO THAN
SCHLEP AROUND A GOLF COURSE.
John: YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE MARK,
I-I DON'T LIKE GOLF.
BUT I-I LIKE THE CONCEPT.
I THINK YOU'RE IN
A TOUGH POSITION,
BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DO NEED TO EXPAND
BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE WILL TRY
TO COME UP WITH THE IDEA
AND BE YOUR COMPETITION.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU SPREAD YOURSELF TOO THIN...
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
ENOUGH MONEY IN EACH MARKET.
I THINK THERE'S
TOO MUCH WORK HERE.
SO I'D HAVE TO BE OUT.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: SO, I-I THINK
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BUSINESS.
YOU'VE BUILT IT
FROM NOTHING.
BUT EVERY BUSINESS IS A LIVING,
BREATHING THING,
AND IT GOES THROUGH
DIFFERENT STAGES.
THERE'S THE HUSTLE STAGE,
WHERE YOU NEED MORE HUSTLE,
MORE TIME,
AND YOU JUST GOT TO FIND MORE
HOURS THAN THE 24 YOU'RE GIVEN.
AND THEN SOME BUSINESSES
GET TO THE INVESTMENT STAGE.
YOU'RE IN THE HUSTLE STAGE.
I DON'T --
YOU DIDN'T
DO A GOOD JOB TODAY
OF TELLING ME HOW,
AS AN INVESTOR,
I GIVE YOU $100,000 AND YOU
MAKE THE BUSINESS GO BOOM.
YOU GOT LOTS OF HUSTLE.
I WAS --
SO KEEP GOING.
BUT I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
WHO'S LEFT?
IT'S JUST YOU,
THE WORST GOLFER IN THE WORLD.
MR. WONDERFUL.
HE'S OUR IDEAL CUSTOMER.
HE'S PERFECT. SHOWS UP GRUMPY.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE HAS A CADDY,
AND HE'S SUPER HAPPY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT, MEGHAN,
HE'S GRUMPY ALL THE TIME.
I ACTUALLY --
I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THIS PRESENTATION
WAS GOING TO BE
JUST RIDICULOUS.
AND YOU COME BACK...
DID A GOOD JOB.
...AND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.
YEAH.
YOU DID.
SO GOOD FOR YOU.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IS IT INVESTABLE?
I GIVE YOU $100,000, I DON'T
KNOW HOW I EVER GET IT BACK.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
AT OUR GROWTH RATE OF 30%
EVERY YEAR AS AN AVERAGE,
YOU WOULD GET IT BACK
WITHIN FOUR YEARS EASILY.
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
IN BUSINESS IS CASH.
WHEN IT LEAVES -- AND RIGHT NOW
IT'S AROUND MY ANKLE GOING,
"DADDY, NO! DADDY, NO!" --
AND I GIVE IT TO YOU...
Greiner: [ LAUGHS ]
...NOW IT'S REALLY SCARED
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN IT'S COMING HOME.
I WOULD -- I WOULD IDEALLY
LIKE TO PAY YOU BACK
BY THE END OF THE YEAR
AND THEN HAVE YOU AS A PARTNER.
I'VE NEVER MARKETED THIS.
IF WE HAD A BOOTH AT THE PGA
SHOW IN ORLANDO EVERY YEAR,
FORGET IT -- OUR BOOKINGS
WOULD BE THROUGH THE ROOF.
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
THE ONLY WAY THIS WORKS
IS VERY SIMPLE.
I GIVE YOU $100,000.
I BECOME A 50/50 PARTNER.
AND THE REASON YOU WOULD DO THIS
IS ONLY IF YOU BELIEVED
YOU COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE
YOUR BUSINESS WITH MY $100,000.
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU
THE DEVIL
WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER DEAL
THAN KEVIN.
NEGOTIATE A LITTLE BIT AND IT'S
NOT THAT BAD A DEAL, RIGHT?
BECAUSE YOU --
IT'S A HORRIBLE DEAL.
IT'S A HORRIBLE DEAL.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD A DEAL.
50% FOR $100,000.
YOU KNOW,
ISN'T TALK CHEAP, MEGHAN?
THE ONLY SHARK THAT BELIEVED
IN YOU IS MR. WONDERFUL.
THAT'S IT.
WHICH IS...REALLY SURPRISING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT...
GOOD ANSWER.
IF YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU CAN MORE THAN DOUBLE IT,
DON'T DO THIS DEAL.
I KNOW I COULD.
THEN WHAT
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU HALF.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER 40%?
NEVER.
DAMN IT.
MEGHAN, YOU GOT TO
MAKE A DECISION.
I JUST THINK, AT THIS TIME,
50% IS TOO -- TOO MUCH
FOR WHAT I'VE PUT INTO IT.
ARE YOU OFFICIALLY
DECLINING HIS OFFER?
YES.
THEN I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT A LOT.
MEGHAN, YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK, MEGHAN.
THANK YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU, LADIES.
SEE YOU GUYS.
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
I'M NOT GIVING HIM
HALF OF WHAT I HAVE.
NO.
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
HE WAS JUST
PUTTING SOMETHING --
THAT'S LIKE A DIVORCE.
YEAH.
[ ALL CHUCKLE ]
I KNOW MY WORTH
AND I KNOW MY COMPANY'S WORTH,
AND WHAT KEVIN WAS OFFERING ME
JUST WASN'T WORTH IT TO ME.
Narrator:
NEXT UP ARE ENTREPRENEURS
WITH A MODERN AND AFFORDABLE WAY
TO BE FASHIONABLE.
