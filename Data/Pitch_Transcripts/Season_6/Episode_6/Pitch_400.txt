AND THIS IS
MY LOVELY WIFE, SARA.
WE ARE FROM SEBASTOPOL,
CALIFORNIA,
AND THE BEAUTIFUL
SONOMA WINE COUNTRY,
AND WE'RE THE FOUNDERS
OF HONEYFUND,
THE FREE HONEYMOON
GIFT REGISTRY.
WE'RE SEEKING $400,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
HONEYFUND IS A UNIQUE
WEDDING-GIFT REGISTRY
WHERE COUPLES CAN RAISE FUNDS
TOWARD THEIR DREAM HONEYMOON
AS A WEDDING GIFT,
TO CASH FLOW.
Sara: CHEERS.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
CHEERS.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
IN BUSINESS,
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
Herjavec: SARA, HANG ON.
YOUR ANSWER
TO SCALING HONEYFUND
Herjavec: OKAY, SARA, HERE --
HERE'S WHERE I'M AT.
IN MY WORLD, THERE'S TWO TYPES
OF COMPANIES --
HERE'S MY OFFER, SARA.
I'LL GIVE YOU -- YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $400,000.
I'LL GIVE YOU $500,000...
AND THE PLOT THICKENS.
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT,
AND ROBERT HAS OFFERED
THE ONLINE GIFTING
REGISTRY HONEYFUND
$100,000 MORE
THAN THEY WERE SEEKING.
BUT HOW MUCH EQUITY
WILL HE WANT?
I'LL GIVE YOU --
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $400,000?
I'LL GIVE YOU $500,000...
...FOR 50%.
THANK YOU.
SO A $1 MILLION VALUATION.
$1 MILLION VALUATION.
IT'S FOUR TIMES WHAT YOU EARNED
LAST YEAR.
BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTIONS
YOU WANT TO GO,
I GOT TO BE AN EQUAL PARTNER.
HMM.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THOSE ARGUMENTS WITH YOU
ABOUT YOU WANT TO GO THIS WAY,
I WANT TO GO THAT WAY.
WE GOT TO BE
ON THE SAME PAGE.
IF YOU WANT TO DOMINATE
THIS SPACE, I'M YOUR GUY.
AND THE PLOT THICKENS.
O'Leary: OKAY.
SURE DOES.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $400,000.
I DON'T WANT ANY EQUITY.
I WANT 1/3 OF
YOUR TRANSACTIONAL REVENUE
UNTIL I GET THREE TIMES BACK
ON MY $400,000.
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO PAY ME
BACK $1.2 MILLION.
AND HERE'S THE GOOD PART.
AFTER THAT, I'M GONE.
YOU GIVE UP NOTHING.
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
FOR THEM?
I'M GOING TO FUND THEM.
THAT'S IT.
YOU'VE MET A BANKER HERE TODAY.
YEP.
I AM FUNDING YOUR GROWTH
FOR YOU
AND GETTING A PRETTY DECENT
RETURN FOR DOING IT,
BUT NO EQUITY.
IF YOU HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK,
IT'S ALL YOURS.
I GOT IT.
Cuban: HE'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT. I'VE NEVER, EVER,
EVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
SAID, "MR. WONDERFUL OFFERED
A GOOD DEAL."
Sara: I HAVE NEVER HEARD A DEAL
FROM HIM LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
YOU'RE DOING
A PHONY ROYALTY DEAL
DISGUISED AS SOMETHING ELSE.
NO, HE'S NOT. NO, HE'S NOT.
NO, HE'S NOT.
IT'S THE SAME THING.
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER --
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CREATIVITY,
BARBARA.
TO GET MY $1.2 MILLION BACK.
Sara: YES.
I CAN TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY
IT'S A BAD IDEA.
I DON'T LEND MONEY
TO SMALL BUSINESSES
AND TRY TO GET IT BACK
AT ANY COST.
I INVEST IN COMPANIES
TO GROW THEM QUICKLY.
BARB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I LOVE THE TWO OF YOU.
SARA, I'LL MATCH
BARBARA'S OFFER.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
SO, ROBERT,
WE WOULD BE INTERESTED
IN DOING A DEAL WITH YOU
IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING
TO GO DOWN TO 25%.
O'Leary:
THAT'S GOOD DISCIPLINE.
Sara: THANK YOU.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
WHOO-HOO!
I THINK WE JUST GOT THE
BEST DEAL OUT OF MR. O'LEARY
THAT ANYONE'S EVER GOT
OUT OF THE SHARK TANK.
I THINK SO.
I THINK SO.
KEVIN, I THINK YOU --
YOU WAKE UP AT NIGHT
IN YOUR CRIB,
AND YOU SAY, "WHAT DEALS
CAN I COME UP WITH TODAY?"
ROBERT,
YOU HAVE NO CREATIVITY.
YOU -- YOU SHARKS HAVE
NO CREATIVITY WHATSOEVER.
I'M SENDING YOU AN INVOICE
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE LEARNED
SOMETHING TODAY.
Cuban:
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
Narrator: IN SEASON 5,
WE SAW CHARLES MICHAEL YIM
MAKE A DEAL
WITH ALL FIVES SHARKS
FOR HIS INNOVATIVE SMARTPHONE
BREATHALYZER, BREATHOMETER.
PLUG IT INTO A SMARTPHONE.
WITHIN SECONDS,
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT
YOUR BREATH-ALCOHOL LEVEL IS.
$1 MILLION FOR 30%.
I ACCEPT.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
I CAME BY THE TANK TODAY
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET ALL
FIVE SHARKS IN THE SAME ROOM.
HEY, LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HEY, GUYS.
AND I PERSONALLY WANTED
TO DROP BY
TO SHOW THEM BREEZE,
OUR NEWEST PRODUCT.
THIS IS BLUETOOTH.
IT'S WIRELESS.
SO IF I CLICK THIS BUTTON
ON THE BACK,
IT'LL PAIR WITHIN SECONDS.
OH, WOW.
BREEZE IS THE MOST ADVANCED
SMARTPHONE BREATHALYZER
