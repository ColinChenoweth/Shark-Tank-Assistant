HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S JUSTIN FENCHEL.
I'M BRAD SCHULTZ.
AND I'M AIMY STEADMAN,
AND WE'RE FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS.
OUR COMPANY IS
BeatBox BEVERAGES,
AND WE'RE SEEKING $200,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
NOW, KEVIN, YOU KNOW WINE.
SO PICTURE THIS --
A DELIGHTFUL CABERNET
FROM THE BORDEAUX REGION
OF FRANCE.
IT'S BEEN AGED IN OAK BARRELS
FOR 15 YEARS.
IT'S PERFECT.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN ALMOST TASTE IT,
RIGHT?
IF THAT'S TRUE, BRING IT OVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL,
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.
WHAT?
Together: BORING!
EXACTLY!
[ LAUGHS ]
Corcoran:
NOW WE'RE GETTING DOWN.
OH.
THIS IS BeatBox BEVERAGES,
AND WE ARE NOT BORING.
WE'RE CHANGING BOX WINE FOREVER
WITH FLAVORS LIKE
CRANBERRY LIMEADE
AND BLUE-RASPBERRY LEMONADE,
ALL IN ONE
SWEET-LOOKING BeatBox.
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A BOX.
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE.
OOH.
TAKE BeatBox
TO YOUR NEXT PARTY,
Steadman: BOXED WINE
IS INCREDIBLY POPULAR.
IT'S AFFORDABLE,
IT'S CONVENIENT,
IT'S GOT A LARGE SIZE
WHERE YOU CAN SHARE
WITH EVERYONE AT THE PARTY.
Herjavec: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
SO FAR, JUSTIN?
WE'VE DONE $235,000
IN 14 MONTHS,
AND $120,000 IS COMING
JUST THIS QUARTER.
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU RAISE
WHEN YOU STARTED THIS?
SO -- SO, WE SELF-FUNDED IT
FOR $55,000.
WE TOOK ON $100 -- $100,000
IN FAMILY AND FRIENDS' DEBT.
SO TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GONNA GO
FROM $235,000 TO $5 MILLION.
SO, THE STRATEGY IS
TO IDENTIFY NEW STORES
WHERE WE KNOW
IT'S GONNA SELL,
GO INTO THAT STORE,
SUPPORT IT WITH AT LEAST
SIX TASTINGS.
TASTINGS ARE BY FAR
THE BEST WAY
FOR US TO GET
THE PRODUCT OUT THERE.
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY FOR?
Fenchel: IT'S FOR THE ENGINE
FOR GROWTH.
OPENING UP NEW STORES
AND, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTING IT
WITH TASTINGS.
OUR TASTINGS COST,
ON AVERAGE...
SO, HIRING THE PEOPLE --
...$100 PER TASTING
IS ON AVERAGE INTO --
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
IT IS.
DOING IT IN THE STORES
SOUNDS REALLY, REALLY GOOD,
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD
TO LEVERAGE.
ONE STORE AT A TIME,
EVEN WITH BRAND AMBASSADORS,
YOUR LEVERAGE POINTS
PER ANY ONE STORE AREN'T GREAT.
IN MY MIND,
THE STRATEGY WAS WRONG.
YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO --
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVENTS,
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BIG,
YOU KNOW, PLACES
WHERE THERE ARE THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE.
FEEL LIKE WE'VE ELIMINATED
A LOT OF THE RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW
CONSUMER-PRODUCTS COMPANY
IN THIS SPACE.
WE'VE GOT OUTSOURCE
MANUFACTURING,
WE'VE GOT THE LARGEST
DISTRIBUTOR IN THE STATES,
AND WE NEED SOMEONE TO
HELP US SCALE THIS BUSINESS.
THE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU GUYS
IS THERE -- THERE'S --
THERE'S EXAMPLES OF BEVERAGES
THAT HAVE GONE VIRAL
AND GONE NATIONAL.
YOU REMEMBER SKINNY --
THE SKINNYGIRL STORY?
ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT WAS THE SAME THING --
VERY VIRAL --
FROM ONE LOCATION.
THEN NEW YORK, FLORIDA,
TEXAS, CALIFORNIA.
BUT SHE RAN LIKE HELL
FOR EVERYWHERE ELSE.
YEAH.
THE -- THE PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE
IS CONVERTING THAT PERSON
THAT'S BUYING THAT BOX OF WINE
FOR A PARTY,
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY'RE BUYING IT.
Herjavec: RIGHT. YEAH.
THAT'S THE EASIEST
CONVERSION.
AND SO, FRANZIA --
AN EXAMPLE --
IS THE NUMBER-ONE BOX WINE
IN THE WORLD,
NUMBER-ONE BY VOLUME.
A BILLION DOLLARS
IN SALES.
FRANZIA DOES $1 BILLION.
IT IS 3% --
WHAT?!
BUT YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT
100% PENETRATION
AND DISTRIBUTION,
AND EVERYBODY'S TRIED
TO KNOCK IT OFF.
I'M IN THE WINE BUSINESS.
I SELL 50,000 CASES A YEAR,
$2.6 MILLION THIS YEAR.
TOOK ME THREE YEARS
TO GET THERE,
AND THE THING
THAT'S HOLDING ME BACK --
YOU FORGOT -- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK --
THE NAME.
IT'S CALLED "O'LEARY WINE."
THAT'S WHY IT SELLS.
YOU GOT TO
CALL IT BeatBox.
YEAH.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'D LIKE TO OFFER YOU $400,000
FOR 20%.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
$400,000 FOR 20%,
BARBARA?
YES.
GUYS, THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IS BREAKING THOSE STATES
THROUGH THEIR
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
AND -- AND YOU COULD CERTAINLY
HELP WITH THAT.
NO, DEFINITELY.
OR THE BLUE STATES.
BUT I'LL PUT MY OFFER
ON THE TABLE.
WITH MY OWN EXPERIENCE,
I THINK I'M WORTH TWICE AS MUCH
AS BARBARA.
I'M SORRY.
HOW LOVELY.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S DOING IN THIS SPACE.
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000
FOR 20%,
'CAUSE I THINK THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH A MILLION BUCKS
RIGHT NOW.
$200,000 -- SO YOU'RE CUTTING
BARBARA'S OFFER IN HALF.
YEAH.
NOW, THEY COULD GO
WITH BARBARA.
BECAUSE YOU MAKE
A SNOOTY WINE
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.
NO. UNFORTUNATELY, I'VE LIVED
THROUGH DISTRIBUTION.
THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE
ARE BUYING.
IT'S TOUGH.
WE'RE GONNA DO 22,000 CASES,
9-LITER CASES, THIS YEAR.
MARK?
WHAT?
WHAT UP?
[ CHUCKLES ]
"WHAT UP?"
HOMEY.
I DON'T SEE THIS
AS A WINE PRODUCT.
YOU GUYS GOT THAT DOWN,
RIGHT?
YOU GUYS DON'T SELL WINE.
RIGHT.
AND EITHER YOU'RE THERE
TO FULFILL...
Schultz: YEAH.
...OR YOU LOSE
AN OPPORTUNITY.
Schultz: I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
SAYING THAT AND THAT OFFER,
YOU KNOW,
THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT.
WE -- WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE
GIVING UP, YOU KNOW --
YOU GOT A COUNTER,
JUST COME BACK AND TELL ME.
YEAH, SO, WOULD YOU DO
$1 MILLION FOR A THIRD?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
DEAL?
YOU READY?
[ CHUCKLES ]
WOW!
[ LAUGHTER ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
LET'S PARTY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S DO WORK, BABY.
THAT'S A $3 MIL VALUATION.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
