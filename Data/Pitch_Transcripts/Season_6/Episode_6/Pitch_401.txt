MY NAME IS CURT CAMPBELL,
WITH MY FABULOUS WIFE, AMY JOE,
AMY JOE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
WE WERE HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
38 AMAZING YEARS.
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,
MY ROCK, MY LIGHT.
MEANS THAT WE CAN HAVE STORES
IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN AMERICA
HI,
MY NAME IS CURT CAMPBELL,
CURT, CAN WE TRY IT?
YOU MAY ABSOLUTELY TRY IT.
SO, CURT, TODAY THE STORE
IS A RETAIL LOCATION,
BUT, CURT, IS THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE?
HOW MUCH OF THAT
IS IN THE SUMMER?
NO, I-I DO NOT WORK
IN THE STORE.
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THE STORE
THREE YEARS AGO
BECAUSE THE STRESS
WAS KILLING ME.
CURT, I GET IT.
WHAT I SEE IN FRONT OF ME
IS A LOVELY, PATIENT,
HARDWORKING GENTLEMAN.
THANK YOU.
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS,
IT IS ONE ROYAL
PAIN IN THE NECK,
Herjavec: CURT,
IT'S A GREAT BUSINESS.
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
VERY FEW PEOPLE EVER DO.
YOU CREATED SOMETHING
FROM NOTHING.
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO WORK
WITH YOU,
BUT THE OLIVE OIL ISN'T TALKING
MY LANGUAGE.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary: THIS IS A GREAT
BUSINESS FOR YOU.
I DON'T PERSONALLY THINK
IT'S READY TO JUMP
TO THE FRANCHISE MODEL YET.
ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE ME OUT
NO, I WON'T --
I WON'T SHOOT YOU, CURT.
HE'LL JUST WOUND YOU.
HE'LL JUST WOUND YOU.
YOU'RE A MASTERFUL --
[ LAUGHS ]
LOOK, YOU -- YOU REALLY HUSTLED
TO CREATE SOMETHING
THAT ADDS VALUE TO
CERTAIN RETAIL LOCATIONS.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
YES.
BUT FOR ME, IT'S NOT INVESTABLE.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
MARK?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A "SHARK TANK"
GOLD DIGGER IS?
WHAT WE CALL A GOLD DIGGER
IS SOMEONE WHO COMES IN HERE
LOOKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE EXPOSURE OF "SHARK TANK"
WITH NO INTENTION
OF EVER GETTING A DEAL.
YOU ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO
CURT, SAY HELLO TO AMY JOE
FOR US.
I WILL. I WILL.
THANK YOU.
WE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD
TO GET HERE,
HELLO.
MY NAME IS JOSH MARGULIS,
JOSH CREATED A SIMPLE PAGE
ON OUR OWN WEDDING WEBSITE.
THIS WAS 10 YEARS AGO,
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
A PHENOMENAL JOB
OF CREATING TRANSACTION VALUE.
JOSH, THE ONLY THING
HE CARES ABOUT
IN HIS OFFER
IS GETTING HIS MONEY BACK.
OF COURSE.
WHICH IS FINE.
Herjavec:
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, JOSH.
YOU'RE GONNA NEGOTIATE WITH ME
ON A 5% DEAL?
WE DON'T WANT TO START
THAT WAY.
I'M STICKING AT $400,000
AT 30%.
[ WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ]
MR. O'LEARY,
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
WHOA.
WOW.
WHAT A SURPRISE.
I THINK YOU MADE
A WISE DECISION.
WOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD JOB.
AWESOME.
I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
POWER OF "SHARK TANK"
BRINGING SOMETHING
THAT WAS JUST IN MY GARAGE
TO STORE SHELVES TODAY --
IT'S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS AN INNOVATION
IN THE PERSONAL SECURITY
BUSINESS.
HELLO, SHARKS.
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE PART
OF THIS JOURNEY.
I'M OUT.
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.
I THINK ANYTHING THAT KEEPS
PEOPLE SAFER IS A GREAT THING.
MM-HMM.
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT
IT'S BEING EXECUTED PROPERLY
OR NOT AT THIS POINT.
SURE.
WILL THE SHARKS BE JOINING
THE BeatBox PARTY?
LET'S TRY SOME!
YEAH!
YEAH!
WHAT IS ORANGE WINE?
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.
YEAH, SO, ORANGE WINE IS A --
IS A UNIQUE WINE.
IT'S ACTUALLY, UH, CLEAR,
MUCH MORE LIKE A WHITE SPIRIT.
THE BLUE ONE IS THE
BLUE-RASPBERRY LEMONADE.
THE PINK IS
A CRANBERRY LIMEADE.
THE YELLOW-ISH COLOR
IS OUR MARGARITA FLAVOR.
