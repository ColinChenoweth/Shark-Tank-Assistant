IN 2003, WE WERE IN POLAND.
WE CAME ACROSS A SMALL SHOP
THAT WAS BOTTLING OLIVE OIL
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.
WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
AND SAID,
"WHY ISN'T ANYONE DOING THIS
IN AMERICA?"
WE KNEW RIGHT THEN
WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING.
HEY, SAUSAGE GUY!
AND BECOME A NATIONAL BRAND.
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE SELL
THAT BOTTLE OF
TRUFFLE OLIVE OIL FOR?
$16.50.
THAT BOTTLE OF TRUFFLE OIL IS
GOING TO COST ME ABOUT $3.60.
BRINGING OILS OVER
FROM ITALY IN BULK,
I'M ACTUALLY PAYING ABOUT 21
CENTS AN OUNCE FOR MY OLIVE OIL.
Cuban: WHERE DO YOU SELL THIS?
HOW DO YOU SELL IT?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
ET CETERA.
OUR SALES LAST YEAR
WERE $3.1 MILLION.
OH.
WOW.
Greiner: WOW.
Barbara: UNBELIEVABLE.
WHO ARE YOU SELLING TO?
WE MADE A TRIP TO KRAKOW,
POLAND.
AND IN KRAKOW,
I WAS SEEING
THESE LITTLE BOUTIQUE SHOPS
THAT WERE SELLING BULK OILS,
AND THEY WOULD BOTTLE IT
IN FRONT OF YOU.
AND I'M THINKING, "THAT'S THE
COOLEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
WHY ISN'T ANYONE DOING THIS
IN AMERICA?"
WE CAME BACK FROM THAT TRIP,
AND WE OPENED A LITTLE, TINY
RETAIL SHOP
IN FISH CREEK, WISCONSIN --
THE FIRST OLIVE OIL STORE
IN AMERICA.
LAKE OSWEGO, PORTLAND.
AND HOW DO THEY PAY
THE FRANCHISE FEE?
THE FRANCHISE FEE,
WHICH IS $37,500 --
TO START,
BUT WHAT'S THE ONGOING?
8% ROYALTIES.
I THINK I'VE DISTILLED
OUT OF THIS
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE,
BECAUSE I DO COLLECT
OLIVE OILS.
I'M A BUYER OF IT.
I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR
WITH THE INDUSTRY,
AND I'LL MAKE A COMMENT
ON YOUR OLIVE OIL.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.
IT IS A MID- TO LOW-MARKET
OFFERING, OKAY?
HE'S AN OLIVE OIL SNOB.
IN CITIES LIKE CHICAGO
AND NEW YORK
AND DALLAS AND SAN FRANCISCO,
THERE ARE MANY, MANY OPTIONS
IN TERMS OF WHERE
SOMEONE LIKE I
CAN GO TO BUY AND INVEST
IN OLIVE OIL.
RIGHT. YES.
IN THE PLACES YOU HAVE LOCATED,
THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION TO
TASTE IT OR EVEN TO BUY IT,
IN SOME CASES.
AND THE REASON
YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL
IS YOU'VE DEFAULTED
TO THOSE LOCATIONS.
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.
THIS WOULD NOT WORK
IN NEW YORK CITY.
I'M BANKING ON THE FACT
THAT OUR TRADEMARK, OILERIE --
I MEAN, IF YOU WANTED
TO BUY WINE,
YOU'RE GOING TO MAYBE GO
TO A WINERY, BUT...
NOW, LOOK. I-I DON'T THINK
OILERIE IS A BIG ENOUGH
BRAND YET.
"YET."
THIS IS THE NEXT STARBUCKS.
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.
DON'T GO THERE.
I DON'T THINK.
IN FISH CREEK, WISCONSIN,
APPLE DOES $6,000 A SQUARE FOOT
RETAIL SPACE,
TIFFANY DOES $3,000.
OILERIE FISH CREEK
IS NUMBER THREE AT $2,100.
WE'VE HAD
CABLE DISCONNECTED.
I'VE BEEN THERE.
WE WOULD CLOSE
ON WEDNESDAYS,
AND I WOULD TAKE THE TRUCK
TO GREEN BAY TO THE WAREHOUSE
AND BRING BACK
SIX MORE PALLETS
SO THAT WE COULD WORK
ANOTHER WEEK.
THAT WANT TO BE ENTREPRENEURS
THAN WE EVER COULD.
IS GOING TO GET ENORMOUS
EXPOSURE, AND I'M GLAD.
YOU REALLY HAVE A NEED
FOR ONE OF US,
AND I WAS HOPING ONE OF US
WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.
AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME,
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU...
...JUST DON'T SEE
MY BEING A PARTNER
FOR YOUR KIND OF BUSINESS.
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND,
AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE SAID TODAY,
AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THAT.
THANK YOU.
A HONEYMOON THEY MIGHT NOT
OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO AFFORD.
AND THEIR WEDDING GUESTS
ARE FREE FROM SHOPPING
AT THE SAME OLD
DEPARTMENT STORES
FOR THE SAME BORING
WEDDING GIFTS.
INSTEAD, THEY GET TO GIVE
SOMETHING WAY MORE EXCITING --
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
HONEYMOON.
WOULD YOU RATHER GIVE SOMEONE
A BLENDER
OR A NIGHT
IN A BEACH BUNGALOW?
INSTEAD OF A SET OF CHINA,
HOW ABOUT A TRIP <i>TO</i> CHINA?
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
COUPLES CREATE
A HONEYFUND PAGE
LISTING ALL THE FUN ASPECTS
OF THEIR HONEYMOON,
THINGS LIKE A COUPLE'S MASSAGE
OR SCUBA DIVING.
WEDDING GUESTS
VISIT THE PAGE
AND MAKE A CHOICE
FROM THE REGISTRY,
AND THE GIFT FUNDS
ARE PAID
DIRECTLY TO THE COUPLE'S
PAYMENT ACCOUNT.
WE CALL THIS PROCESS
"CROWD-GIFTING" --
CROWDFUNDING FOR GIFTS.
SO, RIGHT NOW WE'D LIKE
TO GET YOU GUYS
IN THE HONEYMOON SPIRIT.
OH.
Herjavec: OH!
ALOHA.
ALOHA.
ALOHA, MR. HERJAVEC.
[ CHUCKLES ]
THANK YOU.
Greiner: THANK YOU.
HI, MR. O'LEARY.
WHAT'S IN THIS?
PLEASE,
CALL ME MR. WONDERFUL.
OKAY, MR. WONDERFUL.
THIS HAS BEEN
A WONDERFUL HONEYMOON WITH YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CHEERS, MARK.
SO NOW WE'D LIKE
TO PROPOSE A TOAST
Sara:
SO WE CREATED PLUMFUND.
ANYONE CAN RAISE MONEY
FOR ANYTHING WITH THIS SITE.
THIS WOMAN'S
HAVING A BIRTHDAY.
WE HAD A WOMAN THAT GRADUATED
WITH HER MASTER'S DEGREE.
IS TO DO ANOTHER FUND.
OUR ANSWER IS TO DO
A WHOLE PORTFOLIO OF FUNDS.
UGH.
ARE THESE UP AND RUNNING?
PLUMFUND AND HONEYFUND
ARE RUNNING.
THESE ARE PLANNED.
OKAY, GIVE US THE METRICS
ON PLUMFUND.
WHEN DID IT START,
WHAT ARE THE REVENUES NOW?
WE'VE GENERATED $400,000
WITH PLUMFUND
AND ABOUT $10,000
IN REVENUE.
HOW MANY MONTHS?
UH, FOR ABOUT 12 MONTHS.
Herjavec: I THINK
IT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA,
BUT YOU --
YOU'RE NOT SELLING ME.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER IDEA
FOR YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
FONDODEMIEL -- THAT IS SPANISH
FOR "HONEYFUND."
THERE ARE 53 MILLION SPANISH
SPEAKERS IN THE U.S. ALONE.
THIS COULD DOUBLE OUR BUSINESS
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
YOU TOLD ME $217,000 AFTER YOU
PAID YOURSELF, PRE-TAX.
YES.
THAT'S $150,000 AFTER TAX OF
FREE CASH THIS CALENDAR YEAR.
YEAH. MM-HMM.
FOR THE VALUE ON IT
OF $4 MILLION.
MM-HMM.
YOU WANT ME TO PAY 26 TIMES
YOUR FREE CASH FLOW
TO BUY EQUITY
IN YOUR COMPANY.
WE ARE -- THANK YOU FOR ASKING
ABOUT THE VALUATION.
IT'S BASED ON PROJECTIONS
FOR 2015.
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO GROW BY 350%?
HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?
BY ADDING THE OTHER LIFE EVENTS
AND SPANISH.
OH! SO THAT'S THE RISK
I HAVE TO TAKE --
THAT YOUR CUSTOMER
ACQUISITION COSTS
WILL BE THE SAME FOR THAT
AS THEY WERE ON THIS.
THEY'LL BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER,
BUT THEY COME DOWN OVER TIME,
IN OUR EXPERIENCE.
YOU KNOW, I LOVE THE IDEA OF YOU
TAKING IT TO OTHER COUNTRIES --
DOING IT IN SPANISH.
YOU'RE JUST EXPANDING IT.
I THINK
THAT'S REALLY SMART.
BUT I THINK CROWDFUNDING
IS CROWDED.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
LORI.
THANK YOU.
IF YOU GET FUNDED TODAY,
HOW WOULD I GET
MY $400,000 BACK?
SO, WHAT WE'RE
PLANNING TO DO
IS SCALE THE BUSINESS QUICKLY
OVER FIVE YEARS,
REALLY DOMINATE
THE CROWD-GIFTING SPACE.
GUYS, JUST -- JUST WHAT
YOU SAID RIGHT THERE
DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SCALING
QUICKLY OVER FIVE YEARS.
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS
A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY,
AND BY SAYING
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING
AT ALL THESE OTHER OPTIONS,
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION
TO GO OUT AND DOMINATE JUST
WHAT YOU ALREADY SUPPOSEDLY
ARE DOMINATING IN.
WE ALREADY DO DOMINATE
THIS MARKET.
Cuban: THEN --
WE HAVE 30% MARKET SHARE
IN THIS SPACE.
YOU'VE GOT A NICE, LITTLE
BUSINESS, LIKE I SAID.
BRAVO. RIGHT?
BUT WHEN A BUSINESS
GETS TO A POINT
WHERE YOU HAVE TO START LOOKING
EVERYWHERE ELSE,
IT SUGGEST TO ME
THAT IT'S ON AUTOPILOT.
IF IT WAS GROWING SO FAST
AND IT WAS SO PROFITABLE,
THEN YOU'D BE TELLING US,
"WE NEED THIS CAPITAL
JUST TO KEEP UP WITH IT."
AND THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.
ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE APPROACHING
YOUR CORE VALUE
AND TRYING TO MONETIZE IT
THE WRONG WAY.
HMM.
I CAN HELP YOU.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON A SECOND.
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS GROWING
THE BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALLY.
I WOULD PREFER THAT YOU FOCUS
ON GETTING BACK MORE OF THAT
70% SHARE YOU DON'T HAVE,
AND I WOULD WORK TOWARDS THAT,
BECAUSE IT WOULD COMPRESS
THE TIME I'M WAITING
YOU'RE ROCK SOLID.
YOU COULDN'T BE BETTER PARTNERS.
HERE'S MY OFFER.
$400,000 FOR 30%.
IN THE WORLD.
IT'S WIRELESS,
AND IT HAS
A STATE-OF-THE-ART SENSOR
WHICH ALLOWS IT TO HAVE
REAL-TIME RESULTS.
THIS REALLY
TURNED OUT NICELY.
WE ALWAYS LOVE
TO HEAR GREAT NEWS.
NOW GET BACK TO WORK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE FORMED A PARTNERSHIP
WITH CLEVELAND CLINIC,
WHICH IS THE NUMBER-ONE BREATH
ANALYSIS LAB IN THE WORLD.
TOGETHER, WE'LL BUILD PRODUCTS
THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE
THE BREATH-ANALYSIS SPACE.
IT'S PERFECT.
UP UNTIL NOW, WE'VE BEEN
PREDOMINANTLY ONLINE,
BUT WE'RE ABOUT
TO ROLL OUT NATIONWIDE.
BECAUSE OF THE HELP
OF THE SHARKS,
WE'RE GONNA BE AVAILABLE
AT BEST BUY AND BROOKSTONE.
THERE IT IS.
OH, THERE IT IS.
ON MY LAST UPDATE
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO,
I REPORTED A LITTLE
OVER $1 MILLION IN SALES.
NOW, JUST A YEAR AFTER AIRING,
WE HAVE CLOSE TO $10 MILLION
IN SALES.
MY NAME IS PHIL REITNOUR
FROM MELVIN, PENNSYLVANIA,
AND I'M THE FOUNDER
OF EmergenSee.
AND I'M JASON FRIEDBERG,
A RETIRED POLICE CHIEF,
ALSO FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
WE ARE SEEKING $250,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF OUR BUSINESS.
EmergenSee IS AN AMAZING
NEW MOBILE TECHNOLOGY
THAT TURNS YOUR SMARTPHONE
OR TABLET
INTO A PERSONAL
SECURITY SYSTEM.
THIS STREAMS LIVE VIDEO,
AUDIO, GPS, LOCATION,
AND MOVEMENTS TO GET THE HELP
YOU NEED IMMEDIATELY,
ALL WITH A TAP
OF THE APP.
SHARKS, EACH YEAR,
OVER 237 MILLION
EMERGENCY CALLS ARE MADE
TO 911 CENTERS
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE.
70% OF THOSE CALLS ARE MADE
FROM MOBILE DEVICES.
UNFORTUNATELY,
NOT ALL 911 CENTERS
CAN RECEIVE GPS LOCATION
INFORMATION,
AND ONLY A HANDFUL CAN RECEIVE
TEXT MESSAGES,
AND NONE CAN RECEIVE VIDEO --
UNTIL NOW.
EmergenSee IS
THE PERFECT SOLUTION.
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK.
Woman: THE EmergenSee APP
TURNS YOUR SMARTPHONE
INTO YOUR OWN
PERSONAL SECURITY SYSTEM
THAT INSTANTLY CONNECTS YOU TO
FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND AUTHORITIES
DURING AN EMERGENCY.
IF YOU'RE WALKING ALONE AT NIGHT
AND FEEL UNSAFE OR THREATENED,
JUST TAP THE EmergenSee APP
AND YOUR PERSONAL SECURITY
SYSTEM ENGAGES.
EmergenSee INSTANTLY TRANSMITS
STREAMING LIVE VIDEO,
LIVE AUDIO, PINPOINTS YOUR EXACT
LOCATION ON A GEO-MAP,
AND ALL THIS IS SENT DIRECTLY
TO YOUR DESIGNATED EMERGENCY
CONTACTS AND RESPONDERS.
HELP IS JUST A SINGLE TAP AWAY
WITH THE FREE DOWNLOAD
OF EmergenSee.
SHARKS, EmergenSee
IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING
THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART
SECURITY TECHNOLOGY
TO NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS
AND BUSINESSES
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
AND AROUND THE WORLD.
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
WOULD LOVE TO EMERGE WITH US
AND SEE YOUR
INVESTMENT GROW?
SO, HOW'S IT ALL CONFIGURED?
YOU DOWNLOAD THE APP,
AND YOU PUT
ALL YOUR INFORMATION IN,
AND IT GOES DIRECTLY TO OUR
BACK END 911 MONITORING CENTER.
YOU HAVE A -- YOU BUILT
A BACK END INTERFACE
TO THE EXISTING 911 SYSTEM?
WE -- ACTUALLY, TO OUR OWN
PRIVATE MONITORING CENTER.
SO YOU DO IT LIKE
A SECURITY FIRM, BASICALLY.
CORRECT.
JASON, WHEN THAT PERSON
IN YOUR CENTER
IS GETTING THE INFORMATION,
WHAT DO THEY GAIN?
THEY GET AUDIO, VIDEO,
GPS TRACKING,
THE ABILITY TO TEXT AND HAVE
A CONVERSATION IMMEDIATELY.
IN YOUR OWN EXAMPLE,
THAT GIRL IS WALKING,
SHE'S GOT THE PHONE
IN HER HAND.
SURE. CORRECT.
SHE TAPS THE BUTTON.
YEP.
SHE'S WORRIED THERE'S SOMEBODY
BEHIND HER.
CORRECT.
SHE'S NOT GONNA TAKE THAT PHONE,
TURN AROUND, AND GO LIKE THAT.
WE'RE NOT ASKING HER TO.
WHAT WE HOPE TO DO
IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT
IS THEY ACTUALLY START TO ROLL
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
FIRE, AND EMS
IF THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.
BUT I DON'T GET WHY THAT'S
AN ADVANTAGE IN ANY WAY.
LIKE, SAY, FOR EXAMPLE --
WHY WOULDN'T I SPEED DIAL 911
AND FEEL JUST AS --
WELL, 911
VERSUS TAPPING THAT --
OR SPEED DIAL 911.
Greiner:
WELL, ONE VERSUS THREE.
WELL, AND -- AND THE REAL ISSUE
WITH DIALING THE 911 IS
ALL THEY'RE GONNA GET
IS MUFFLED NOISES.
WITH A VIDEO, IT ADDS
A COMPLETELY NEW DIMENSION.
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING IT?
UH...
211,000.
DO YOU CHARGE THEM
TO DOWNLOAD IT?
IT'S A FREE DOWNLOAD
WITH THE ABILITY TO UPGRADE
FOR A MONTHLY SERVICE.
WITH THE FREE VERSION,
THERE'S NO MONTHLY MONITORING.
IT'S SENT TO FAMILY
AND FRIENDS.
IT DOESN'T GO TO THE POLICE.
BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.
CORRECT --
THE FREE VERSION.
THE PAID VERSION --
DO YOU HAVE 211,000
PREMIUM SUBSCRIBERS?
NO.
NO.
YOU HAVE 211,000 DOWNLOADS.
CORRECT.
DING, DING, DING, DING, DING,
DING, DING!
JUST LET ME SAY THAT, AS FAR
AS THE PREMIUM CUSTOMER GOES --
THE MONTHLY SUBSCRIBERS --
THAT WAS ONLY ROLLED OUT
A MONTH AGO.
OF THE 211,000,
HOW MANY WENT
FOR THE PREMIUM SERVICE?
WELL, WE JUST STARED
A MONTH AGO.
I THINK THERE'S LIKE 138.
HOW MUCH ARE THEY PAYING
A MONTH?
$8.99 A MONTH.
BUT OVER
THE PAST SIX MONTHS,
WE'VE SIGNED UP NUMEROUS
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.
WE HAVE, UH, SOME ENTERPRISES,
BUSINESSES, WE SIGNED UP.
WE ALSO HAVE SOME
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
TELL ME ABOUT
THE ENTERPRISE VERSION. JUST --
WE COME TO YOUR COLLEGE
OR UNIVERSITY
OR CORPORATION
AND WE INSTALL IT.
WE SET UP A GEO-FENCE
AT YOUR LOCATION.
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS
WITHIN THAT GEO-FENCE
GOES RIGHT TO YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY
OR SECURITY DEPARTMENT.
AND GEOFENCE MEANS THAT
YOU CAN RECOGNIZE ANYTHING
INSIDE THAT PERIMETER?
CORRECT.
SO, LORI'S AT COLLEGE,
AND THAT UNIVERSITY
OR COLLEGE
IS PART OF
YOUR ENTERPRISE PROGRAM.
RIGHT.
SO SHE PUSHES THE BUTTON.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS.
IF THEY HIT IT AND THEY'RE
ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS,
IT GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE PUBLIC
SAFETY DEPARTMENT.
ARE THEY PAYING YOU
FOR THIS?
AVERAGE INSTALLATION
FOR A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY
IS ABOUT $25,000 TO START.
$25,000 ANNUALLY?
YES, ANNUALLY.
SO THAT'S A LITTLE BUSINESS.
NOW WE'RE TALKING!
OKAY, SO WHAT'S
YOUR TOTAL SALES?
$180 -- $185,000.
OF THE $185,000,
WHAT WAS YOUR PROFIT?
THERE'S NO PROFIT
AT THIS TIME.
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE
PROFITABLE AROUND OCTOBER.
Greiner:
BUT WHAT DID YOU LOSE?
HOW MUCH DID YOU
PUT IN YOURSELF?
I PUT IN OVER $3 MILLION.
Both: $3 MILLION?
OOH.
Corcoran: OH, MY GOD.
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT MONEY FROM?
I WAS IN BANKING, OIL,
REAL ESTATE.
SOLD ALL THOSE OFF.
WHO -- WHO'S YOUR TECH --
WHO'S YOUR MAIN GEEK?
MAIN GEEK IS A GUY NAMED --
IS A GUY NAMED JEAN.
IT'S A GREAT COMPANY
THAT WE HAVE WORKING WITH US.
SO YOU CAME UP WITH THE IDEA,
RIGHT?
Reitnour: YES.
YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.
AND THEN YOU OUTSOURCED IT
TO THESE GUYS,
WHO CHARGED YOU HOW MUCH?
WE STARTED FIRST WITH A GUY
WHO WAS A DIRECTOR, UH,
OF TECHNOLOGY AT APPLE.
HE PUT ME IN TOUCH
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.
YOU REALIZED THAT WAS A
SUPER-COMPETITIVE BUSINESS,
RIGHT, THAT WAS GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT?
YEP, THAT'S CORRECT.
THAT'S CORRECT.
SO YOU SAID, "I NEED
SOME MORE BRAIN POWER
"TO MAKE IT MORE --
MORE ADVANCED
SO THAT I CAN
DIFFERENTIATE MYSELF."
RIGHT.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU PAID THEM
TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY?
THE FIRST SECTION
OF THE DEVELOPMENT
FOR THE TECHNOLOGY
WAS ABOUT 500 GRAND,
AND THEN I'D SAY THE NEXT PART
WAS, YOU KNOW, $750,000,
AND THEN THE LAST PART
WAS ABOUT $750,000.
WHOA.
THEY SAW YOU COMING, BRO.
YEAH.
YOU PUT $3 MILLION IN.
WHAT'S LEFT IN THE BANK?
ROUGHLY,
THERE'S $68,000 IN THE BANK.
WOW!
LOOK, YOU -- YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH A PROBLEM
THAT EVERY ENTREPRENEUR
WHO'S NON-TECHNICAL DEALS WITH
TRYING TO CREATE A COMPANY
THAT'S BUILT ON TECHNOLOGY,
RIGHT?
THE ONE CONSTANT IN ANY
TECHNOLOGY-BASED COMPANY
IS WHAT?
CHANGE.
CHANGE.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY
INSIDE AND OUT
TO BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE
WHERE THINGS ARE GOING.
THAT'S NOT YOU.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I TOTALLY TRUSTED YOU GUYS.
YOU'RE GREAT.
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
I JUST DON'T HAVE THE FAITH
THAT THIS BUSINESS WILL WORK.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I KNOW THERE'S A SENSE
OF CONCERN
BECAUSE YOU'VE SHOWN ME
A VALUATION
OF $2.5 MILLION
WHEN YOURS IS OVER $3 MILLION.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME,
AS AN INVESTOR,
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE DILUTION
IF I DEPLOY MY CAPITAL.
YEAH, HE'S IN SO DEEP,
YOUR PANT LEGS ARE ROLLED UP
RIGHT NOW. I MEAN...
WHAT IT HAS TO BE --
PHIL, THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE.
Reitnour: YEAH. RIGHT.
THEY SPEAK TO ME.
I'M A CASH WHISPERER.
SO, YOU KNOW,
I WISH YOU GUYS LUCK,
I WAS A STAY-AT-HOME DAD.
AND I WAS GONNA CONQUER
THE WORLD OF SECURITY,
SO I OPENED UP
THE BUSINESS.
WE STARTED WITH MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS,
'CAUSE I KNEW <i>EVERYTHING,</i>
RIGHT?
RIGHT.
OUR FORECAST WAS $5 MILLION
IN SALES.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SOLD?
$400,000.
WE LOST $1 MILLION.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID?
"THAT'S OKAY.
LET ME PUT ANOTHER
$1 MILLION IN."
THAT'S THE CURSE
OF SUCCESS.
YOU GET ARROGANT THINKING
EVERYTHING YOU DO IS SMART.
THE BEAUTY OF NOT HAVING
A LOT OF MONEY
IS YOU TRY SOMETHING,
AND THEN YOU CHANGE.
AND AS MARK SAID,
NEITHER OF YOU ARE A GEEK.
IF YOU'RE
A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY,
YOU GOT TO HAVE
TECHNOLOGY BRAIN TRUST
IN A LEADERSHIP POSITION.
YOU GUYS ARE NOT THE TWO GUYS
TO EXECUTE THIS STRATEGY.
O'Leary: WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
ROBERT?
I'M OUT.
WELL...
I THINK THAT'S IT, GUYS.
THANK YOU ALL.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU ALL.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME
AND ATTENTION. APPRECIATE IT.
THEY SEE
THE TECHNOLOGY PITFALLS
AND THE THINGS THAT WE NEED
TO IMPROVE UPON
TO MAKE IT A VIABLE PRODUCT,
AND I THINK THAT ADVICE,
IN AND OF ITSELF,
IS GONNA BE A HUGE SUCCESS
FOR US.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
LET'S DO THIS.
DO IT!
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
ARE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS
WITH A BEVERAGE
FOR A NEW GENERATION.
AND YOU'RE INSTANTLY
A LEGEND.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT THE WINE YOU FIND INSIDE
LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED.
WE'RE USING
A UNIQUE ORANGE WINE
THAT DRINKS MORE LIKE A SPIRIT
THAN A WINE
AND ALLOWS US
TO CREATE MIXED DRINKS
THAT OUR CUSTOMERS
ABSOLUTELY LOVE.
BeatBox IS A PARTY IN A BOX,
WITH ALMOST SEVEN BOTTLES OF
WINE PACKED INTO EVERY BOX.
WOW.
WE CREATED AN INNOVATIVE,
FUN BRAND
THAT'S REALLY SPEAKING
TO OUR GENERATION,
AND WE'RE READY TO TAKE THIS
COMPANY TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
THE ONLY QUESTION IS,
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS GOOD.
HE LOVES IT!
Man: YEAH!
THIS IS DELICIOUS.
HE'S CRAZY.
IT'S A PARTY.
I LOVE THIS ONE.
REMINDS ME OFF THOSE, LIKE
BLUE-RASPBERRY SNOW CONES.
HOW MUCH ALCOHOL
IS IN HERE?
11.1%.
WHAT?!
YES.
Corcoran: WOW.
LORI, CHEERS.
ONLY 120 CALORIES
PER SERVING.
WHOO!
WHOO!
AND ONLY 7 GRAMS OF SUGAR
PER SERVING.
Herjavec: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOVE THE WINE.
KEVIN, GIVE THEM THE MONEY.
O'Leary:
NO, BUT LET'S...
TELL US MORE
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
SEE, HE'S THE PARTY POOPER.
WHERE IS IT MANUFACTURED?
WHAT ARE YOUR MARGINS?
WHO'S ACTUALLY
DISTRIBUTING IT?
SO, WE SELF-DISTRIBUTE IT.
WE ACTUALLY BECAME
A WINERY OURSELVES.
AS A TEXAS WINERY,
YOU CAN SELF-DISTRIBUTE IT.
BUT WE GOT, YOU KNOW,
TO THE POINT
WHERE WE WERE SPENDING MORE TIME
IN OUR FACILITY MAKING IT,
GLUING THE BOXES,
AND DISTRIBUTING IT.
WE COULDN'T MARKET IT,
RIGHT?
WE'RE GETTING TOO BIG.
SO WE FOUND A CO-PACKER
IN DALLAS,
AND THEY NOW MAKE IT
FOR US.
WE SIGNED ON
WITH A DISTRIBUTOR.
SINCE THEN, WE'VE GROWN
OUR SALES PRETTY DRAMATICALLY.
PERIOD. END OF STORY.
YOU GUYS SELL FUN.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GOT IT.
AND THE BIGGEST
QUESTION IS,
HOW DO YOU CONNECT
WITH ENOUGH PEOPLE
QUICKLY ENOUGH TO MAKE IT
GROW FAST ENOUGH
THAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE GOING,
"WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?"
RIGHT?
'CAUSE Y-YOU'RE GOING AS FAST
AS YOU CAN.
YOU NEED A LOT OF HELP.
YOU WANT TO CREATE AS BIG
A SPLASH AS POSSIBLE,
AND I THINK I'M BEST SUITED
UP HERE TO DO IT.
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE YOU
AN OFFER OF 600K...
FOR 33%.
YOU GUYS GOT TO MAKE A DECISION
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN.
BeatBox BEVERAGES HAS THREE
OFFERS ON THE TABLE --
$400,000 FOR 20% FROM BARBARA,
$200,000 FOR 20% FROM KEVIN,
AND $600,000
FOR 33% FROM MARK.
BUT LORI AND ROBERT
MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED.
I THINK YOU'VE TO BLAST OFF,
YOU'VE GOT TO GO FAST.
THE LAST THING YOU WANT
IS NOT BEING ABLE TO DELIVER,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
VIRAL IS JUST THAT, RIGHT?
I'LL BE IN TOUCH REAL SOON,
AND WE'LL GET IT TURNED AROUND.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT,
HE'S GONNA MAKE MONEY ON IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND THOSE ARE ALL MINE.
DON'T TAKE THEM.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE WERE GONNA MAKE AN OFFER,
BUT --
I KNEW YOU WERE.
YEAH, WELL, IT WASN'T GONNA
COME NEAR <i>THAT</i> THING.
AAH!
WHOO!
DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?
OH, MY GOD!
WOULD I HAVE EVER IMAGINED
THAT WE'D BE DOING A MILLION
DOLLAR DEAL WITH MARK CUBAN?
NO.
BUT HERE WE ARE.
BUT HERE WE ARE.
WE'VE DONE IT.
AND, UH, HOLY COW.
TIME TO GET TO WORK.
YEAH.
I'M JEALOUS OF THE DEAL.
LET'S PARTY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
