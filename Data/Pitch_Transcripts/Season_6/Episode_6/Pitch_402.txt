MY NAME IS CURT CAMPBELL,
AND I LIVE IN BEAUTIFUL
EGG HARBOR, WISCONSIN,
WITH MY FABULOUS WIFE, AMY JOE,
AND I'M THE OWNER
OF OILERIE USA.
AMY JOE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
WE WERE HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
38 AMAZING YEARS.
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,
MY ROCK, MY LIGHT.
AMY JOE AND I HAVE TAKEN MANY
RISKS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS,
BUT WE'RE PEOPLE
THAT NEVER GIVE UP.
WE'VE GONE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK,
AND WE SUFFERED THROUGH
SOME PRETTY HARD YEARS,
BUT WE ALWAYS LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE.
SUPER. THANKS FOR YOUR BUSINESS.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
I KNOW THAT THE OILERIE
CAN BECOME A HUGE
NATIONWIDE BUSINESS,
BUT I'VE TAKEN IT AS FAR
AS I CAN BY MYSELF.
AN INVESTMENT AND A PARTNERSHIP
WITH ANY OF THE SHARKS
MEANS THAT WE CAN HAVE STORES
IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN AMERICA
HI,
MY NAME IS CURT CAMPBELL,
AND I'M FROM BEAUTIFUL
EGG HARBOR, WISCONSIN.
MY COMPANY IS OILERIE USA.
I'M HERE TODAY
ASKING FOR $500,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 35%
OF MY COMPANY.
KEVIN, YOU'VE MENTIONED
THAT YOU COLLECT OLIVE OIL,
SO YOU KNOW THE NUANCES
OF FRESH OIL.
BUT MANY AMERICANS --
A LOT OF AMERICANS --
HAVE NEVER TASTED
FRESH OLIVE OIL.
NOW, BEFORE THE OILERIE
CAME ALONG,
THE ONLY WAY TO BUY OLIVE OIL
WAS TO STARE AT A SHELF
FULL OF PRETTY LABELS
AND BASICALLY POKE AND HOPE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT'S GOING
TO TASTE OR IF IT'S EVEN FRESH.
THE OILERIE OLIVE-OIL-BAR SYSTEM
IS FULL OF MANY FLAVORS
OF FRESH OILS
AND AGED BALSAMIC VINEGAR
THAT ARE STORED
IN THESE EXCLUSIVE,
STAINLESS STEEL TANKS
CALLED "FUSTIS."
NOW, OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN OILERIE
STORE TASTE THE PRODUCT,
AND ONLY AFTER THEY'VE MADE
THEIR SELECTIONS
DO WE BOTTLE IT, AND WE BOTTLE
IT IN FRONT OF THEM.
AND THEY GO CRAZY OVER THE FACT
THAT THEY CAN TRY IT
BEFORE THEY BUY IT.
CURT, CAN WE TRY IT?
YOU MAY ABSOLUTELY TRY IT.
AND THERE'S A PLATE
FOR EACH OF YOU.
DO WE JUST DRINK IT?
IS THERE BREAD OR SOMETHING?
WELL, YOU'RE TASTING
AN INGREDIENT,
SO WE DON'T
CALL IT "DRINKING."
BUT IF YOU'LL JUST TIP IT,
A SMALL DROP WILL ROLL OFF
AND ONTO YOUR TONGUE.
THIS WHITE TRUFFLE --
OH, MY GOSH.
WELL, MY WIFE, AMY JOE, AND I --
HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 38 YEARS.
SO, CURT, TODAY THE STORE
IS A RETAIL LOCATION,
AND YOU DID $3.1 MILLION
LAST YEAR?
IN OUR FRANCHISE SYSTEM!
OH, YOU HAVE
A FRANCHISE SYSTEM?
OH.
I'M SORRY.
I AM -- I AM SORRY.
OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
SINCE THIS WAS
THE FIRST TIME
A SHOP LIKE THIS
EXISTED IN AMERICA,
THERE WAS AN EXTREME AMOUNT
OF INTEREST.
CUSTOMERS WERE DEMANDING
A FRANCHISE.
HOW DO WE DO THIS
ON OUR OWN?
SO WE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT OF MONEY
ON LAWYERS AND CONSULTANTS
AND DEVELOPED THE OILERIE USA
FRANCHISE SYSTEM.
HOW MANY FRANCHISES
DO YOU HAVE?
WE ENDED UP WITH SEVEN.
HILTON HEAD ISLAND,
TWO IN OHIO,
MILWAUKEE, FISH CREEK,
TWO IN THE TWIN CITIES
OF MINNEAPOLIS-SAINT PAUL,
AND THEN ONE
ON THE WEST COAST --
BUT, CURT, IS THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE?
HOW MUCH OF THAT
IS IN THE SUMMER?
NO, I-I DO NOT WORK
IN THE STORE.
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THE STORE
THREE YEARS AGO
BECAUSE THE STRESS
WAS KILLING ME.
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND --
IS YOUR BUSINESS READY TODAY
TO SCALE?
IT IS.
'CAUSE THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMEBODY DOING THE SALES.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY
DOING THE NEGOTIATIONS.
YES.
YOU'RE A GREAT
RELATIONSHIP GUY.
WHO'S DOING THE OTHER PART?
THE ONLY ANSWER I HAVE
FOR YOU, ROBERT,
IS THAT'S WHY I'M HERE --
TO WORK
WITH A PERSON LIKE YOU
FOR FINANCE
AND CASH MANAGEMENT.
YOU'RE AN IMPRESSIVE GUY.
I THINK THE PRODUCT IS GREAT.
BUT YOU ALSO SAID
THAT THE STRESS BOTHERED YOU.
YOU HAD TO TAKE YOURSELF
OUT OF IT.
AND MY CONCERN IS,
WHEN I PARTNER
WITH MY ENTREPRENEURS,
I'M THERE WITH THEM,
I HELP THEM,
BUT I NEED SOMEBODY
WHO IS GOING TO REALLY BE
RUNNING THE BUSINESS
AND THE LEADER IN IT
WHILE THEY GET MY SUPPORT.
AND BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE UP
TO HAVING TO DEAL WITH ALL
THE STRESS OF THAT,
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
MAY I ADDRESS THAT?
OF COURSE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN WE WERE DOING
THE RETAIL STORE,
THIS WAS OUR BABY.
THE RENT WAS $2,000 --
SCARED US TO DEATH
BECAUSE WE
DIDN'T HAVE $2,000.
IN OUR MARRIED LIFE,
WE'VE HAD THE PHONE
DISCONNECTED,
WE'VE HAD THE POWER
DISCONNECTED,
THIS WAS THE 8-DAY-A-WEEK JOB
AND THE 90 HOURS.
NOW, I DON'T MIND DOING THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHAT
EVERY ENTREPRENEUR
WHO WATCHES THIS SHOW
NEEDS TO HEAR.
YEAH.
THAT, IN ORDER
TO GET TO THIS POINT,
THERE ARE TRADE-OFFS,
THERE'S STRESS.
YES.
THERE'S UPS,
AND THERE'S DOWNS.
YOU'RE EXPLAINING MORE
TO PEOPLE
CURT, I GET IT.
WHAT I SEE IN FRONT OF ME
IS A LOVELY, PATIENT,
HARDWORKING GENTLEMAN.
THANK YOU.
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS,
IT IS ONE ROYAL
PAIN IN THE NECK,
AND IT'S A RUN
TO THE FINISH LINE
BEFORE THE NEXT GUY
GETS THERE.
YES.
I THINK YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT
FOR THAT.
AND SO I RELUCTANTLY SAY
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: CURT,
IT'S A GREAT BUSINESS.
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
VERY FEW PEOPLE EVER DO.
YOU CREATED SOMETHING
FROM NOTHING.
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO WORK
WITH YOU,
BUT THE OLIVE OIL ISN'T TALKING
MY LANGUAGE.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary: THIS IS A GREAT
BUSINESS FOR YOU.
I DON'T PERSONALLY THINK
IT'S READY TO JUMP
TO THE FRANCHISE MODEL YET.
ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE ME OUT
BEHIND THE BARN NOW
AND SHOOT ME?
NO, I WON'T --
I WON'T SHOOT YOU, CURT.
HE'LL JUST WOUND YOU.
HE'LL JUST WOUND YOU.
YOU'RE A MASTERFUL --
[ LAUGHS ]
LOOK, YOU -- YOU REALLY HUSTLED
TO CREATE SOMETHING
THAT ADDS VALUE TO
CERTAIN RETAIL LOCATIONS.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
YES.
BUT FOR ME, IT'S NOT INVESTABLE.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
MARK?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A "SHARK TANK"
GOLD DIGGER IS?
WHAT WE CALL A GOLD DIGGER
IS SOMEONE WHO COMES IN HERE
LOOKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE EXPOSURE OF "SHARK TANK"
WITH NO INTENTION
OF EVER GETTING A DEAL.
YOU ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO
CURT, SAY HELLO TO AMY JOE
FOR US.
I WILL. I WILL.
THANK YOU.
WE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD
TO GET HERE,
AND THERE'S GOING
TO ALWAYS BE SETBACKS.
HI.
AND THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO GET UP,
DUST OURSELVES OFF,
AND KEEP DOING WHAT WE DO.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A COUPLE WITH A MODERN TAKE
ON GIFT GIVING.
HELLO.
MY NAME IS JOSH MARGULIS,
AND INVITE YOU TO JOIN US
AS WE CONTINUE TO PIONEER
THE MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
CROWD-GIFTING MARKET.
JOSH CREATED A SIMPLE PAGE
ON OUR OWN WEDDING WEBSITE.
THIS WAS 10 YEARS AGO,
AND OUR WEDDING GUESTS
CONTRIBUTED
MORE THAN $5,000
TO OUR HONEYMOON.
WOW.
WOW.
JOSH AND I WERE ASPIRING
ENTREPRENEURS AT THE TIME.
WE KNEW THAT,
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
WE WERE GOING TO START
OUR OWN VENTURE SOMEDAY.
AND JUST FROM THE REACTION
OF OUR WEDDING GUESTS,
WE KNEW THIS WAS
OUR BUSINESS.
WE'VE HELPED HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF COUPLES
THROUGH OUR SITE,
AND TO DATE,
WE'VE RAISED FOR OUR COUPLES
$200 MILLION.
WHOA.
WOW.
Corcoran:
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?
WE -- WE -- WE HAVE A DEAL
WITH -- WITH PAYPAL.
THE MONEY THAT COMES
FROM GUESTS
GOES DIRECTLY
TO THEIR PAYPAL ACCOUNT,
AND WE'RE TAKING
A SMALL FEE
BECAUSE WE HAVE
SUCH LARGE VOLUME.
WHAT WERE THE SALES LAST YEAR?
IT WAS $67 MILLION?
FOR THE TRANSACTION
VOLUME.
YES.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON THAT?
SO, LAST YEAR,
OUR REVENUE WAS $900,870.
SO ON THAT MILLION,
WHAT DO YOU MAKE ON IT?
AFTER ALL OVERHEAD
AND SALARIES,
WE PROFITED
$217,000 LAST YEAR.
SO THIS ALL ABOUT
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS
AND THEIR VALUE.
YES.
SO GIVE US THOSE NUMBERS.
EVERY COUPLE THAT SIGNS UP
AND PUBLISHES A REGISTRY
INVITES, ON AVERAGE,
150 WEDDING GUESTS
TO COME AND LOOK AT IT.
VERY CLEVER, ACTUALLY.
BUT ON AVERAGE, WE PAY 88 CENTS
TO ACQUIRE A CUSTOMER.
AND WHAT'S THE VALUE?
AND WE GET $9 OUT OF
EVERY CUSTOMER ON AVERAGE.
THAT'S THE AVERAGE VALUE?
YEAH.
GUYS, I GET THAT
AS, YOU KNOW,
A PERSONAL BUSINESS, PUTTING
$500,000, ESSENTIALLY,
IN THE BANK FOR YOURSELVES
AS A COUPLE IS PHENOMENAL.
BUT THERE'S A "BUT" COMING.
YEAH, 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
MAKE IT INVESTABLE.
RIGHT.
RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL US
WHERE YOU'RE GOING FROM THERE
'CAUSE, TO BE HONEST,
TO BE IN BUSINESS 10 YEARS
AND TO DO $987,000 IN
GROSS REVENUE IS HORRIBLE.
OKAY, YEAH.
IT'S -- IT'S BEEN A LIFESTYLE
BUSINESS UP TO THIS POINT.
AND OF COURSE WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE.
"BUT WAIT!"
BUT WAIT.
THERE'S MORE.
SO, PEOPLE HAVE USED
THIS SITE, HONEYFUND,
FOR THINGS
OTHER THAN WEDDINGS.
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
A PHENOMENAL JOB
OF CREATING TRANSACTION VALUE.
THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT TO GO TO,
NOT THE BRAND EXTENSION.
OKAY.
JOSH, THE ONLY THING
HE CARES ABOUT
IN HIS OFFER
IS GETTING HIS MONEY BACK.
OF COURSE.
WHICH IS FINE.
AND SO DO YOU.
WHO DOESN'T?
Herjavec:
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, JOSH.
YOU'RE GONNA NEGOTIATE WITH ME
ON A 5% DEAL?
WE DON'T WANT TO START
THAT WAY.
I'M STICKING AT $400,000
AT 30%.
[ WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ]
MR. O'LEARY,
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
WHOA.
WOW.
WHAT A SURPRISE.
I THINK YOU MADE
A WISE DECISION.
WOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD JOB.
AWESOME.
I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
POWER OF "SHARK TANK"
BRINGING SOMETHING
THAT WAS JUST IN MY GARAGE
TO STORE SHELVES TODAY --
IT'S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS AN INNOVATION
IN THE PERSONAL SECURITY
BUSINESS.
HELLO, SHARKS.
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE PART
OF THIS JOURNEY.
I'M OUT.
I LIKE THE CONCEPT.
I THINK ANYTHING THAT KEEPS
PEOPLE SAFER IS A GREAT THING.
MM-HMM.
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT
IT'S BEING EXECUTED PROPERLY
OR NOT AT THIS POINT.
SURE.
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME
AND YOUR QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I THINK THE MISTAKE
YOU'VE MADE
UP UNTIL THIS POINT.
OKAY.
YOU STARTED
WITH TOO MUCH MONEY.
YEP.
OKAY.
SO, I WENT BACK TO WORK
NINE YEARS AGO.
WILL THE SHARKS BE JOINING
THE BeatBox PARTY?
LET'S TRY SOME!
YEAH!
YEAH!
WHAT IS ORANGE WINE?
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.
YEAH, SO, ORANGE WINE IS A --
IS A UNIQUE WINE.
IT'S ACTUALLY, UH, CLEAR,
MUCH MORE LIKE A WHITE SPIRIT.
THE BLUE ONE IS THE
BLUE-RASPBERRY LEMONADE.
THE PINK IS
A CRANBERRY LIMEADE.
THE YELLOW-ISH COLOR
IS OUR MARGARITA FLAVOR.
AND THE TEA IS A SWEET TEA.
THIS TASTES LIKE [BLEEP]
