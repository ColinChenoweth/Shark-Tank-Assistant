HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S TALIA GOLDFARB,
Goldfarb: OKAY, SO,
THE PARENT IN THE MORNING
SNAPS THE BELT
AROUND THE BELT LOOP,
TALIA, YOU'VE <i>ALWAYS</i> BEEN
AT THE POINT
WHERE YOU'VE NEEDED
A PARTNER, RIGHT?
MAYBE SO.
YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH HAD THE SAME
AMOUNT OF SALES EVERY YEAR.
TALIA, LET ME TELL YOU
WHERE I'M AT.
THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF WARRIORS.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO SIT ON TOP OF THE HILL
TALIA, STOP LOOKING
FOR THE POSITIVE. LOOK
FOR THE OBJECTIONS.
WELL, WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SHOW YOU IS THE OPPORTUNITY.
TALIA, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
NO, I AM.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN SEE
THE OPPORTUNITY.
YOU KNOW WHAT? THE WORST LIES
YOU TELL IN LIFE ARE THE ONES
TALIA, YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO HIM, RIGHT?
WE AGREE
YOU HAVE A GREAT PRODUCT.
BUT YOU --
WE'VE ALL SAID THAT, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
O'Leary: I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE
MARKET. YOU DIDN'T SAY
IT WASN'T A GOOD PRODUCT.
THE MARKET SAYS
THIS PRODUCT'S $200,000 A YEAR.
POTTY-TRAINING'S
A $500-MILLION INDUSTRY.
YEAH, YEAH.
BUT NOT THIS ONE.
OKAY.
I-I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
MORE OPPORTUNITY.
I'M OUT.
I -- OKAY.
Cuban: I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE, RIGHT?
I-I DON'T. I WANT YOU
TO BE SUCCESSFUL, RIGHT?
I SEE -- I SEE
THE FOUNDATION OF A BUSINESS.
AT LEAST
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
I DO.
BUT YOU'RE NOT A KILLER.
TALIA HAS ONE LAST CHANCE
TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR HER CHILDREN'S BELT COMPANY,
MYSELF BELTS.
DAYMOND, I WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME.
I-I KNOW OUR PRODUCT.
I KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS.
OKAY.
I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE LIKE
ABOUT IT.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
I KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT GROW.
[ SIGHS ]
SO, THE LAST FIVE YEARS,
YOU CAME INTO, BASICALLY,
A RECESSION.
YOU PIVOTED. YOU MOVED AROUND.
YOU FIGURED A WAY
TO THEN GO ON TO HOW ONLINE
IS THRIVING RIGHT NOW,
Herjavec: TALIA, REALLY?
THE 5% IS GONNA --
OH, MY GOSH.
I-I -- I'M JUST --
I'M JUST ASKING.
O'Leary: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO STRING YOU UP
Goldfarb: I FEEL LIKE
I WAS JUST IN A FISTFIGHT.
IT WAS UNEXPECTED, 'CAUSE I'VE
WORKED SO HARD. I KNOW WHO I AM.
