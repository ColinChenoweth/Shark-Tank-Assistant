HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS PATRICK WHALEY,
AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND C.E.O.
OF TITIN.
I'M HERE SEEKING $500,000 FOR
A 5% EQUITY STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
YOWZA.
TITIN IS A PATENTED,
FORM-FITTING,
WEIGHTED COMPRESSION GEAR
THAT IS DESIGNED AROUND
THE HUMAN ANATOMY.
OUR APPAREL USES GEL WEIGHTS
AS INSERTS
THAT ARE THE SAME DENSITY
AS YOUR OWN MUSCLE TISSUE,
AND YOU CAN ALSO
HEAT IT OR FREEZE IT,
SO IT'S GREAT
FOR HEALING SORE MUSCLES
AND IMPROVING RECOVERY TIMES.
I'M HERE TODAY TO SHOW YOU THAT
THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO TRAIN.
THE ONLY QUESTION LEFT IS...
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
...WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
CAN KEEP UP?
TALK SCIENCE TO ME.
SURE.
WE'VE HAD INCREASE
IN LACTIC-ACID THRESHOLD.
WE'VE HAD INCREASE
IN MAX VO2 LEVELS.
WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD ATHLETES GAIN
2 INCHES ON A MAX VERT AFTER --
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT WHAT THE ATHLETES DO.
YOU'RE NOT TALKING SCIENCE.
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GIVE ME
ANECDOTAL INFORMATION.
TALK SCIENCE TO ME.
OKAY. THE CONCEPT IS BEING ABLE
TO WEAR A SUIT
THAT IS DESIGNED
AROUND THE HUMAN ANATOMY.
THE GEL'S THE SAME DENSITY
AS YOUR OWN MUSCLE TISSUE,
SO WHEN YOU WEAR IT,
IT BECOMES A PART OF YOU,
WHICH BECOMES AN INTERNAL LOAD
VERSUS AN EXTERNAL LOAD.
IT'S LIKE TRAINING ON EARTH
AND COMPETING ON THE MOON.
SO, YOU'RE TELLING US
WITH A PADDED BRA,
I CAN JUMP 13% HIGHER?
NOW, THE CONCEPT IS
OUR 8 POUNDS
FEELS LIKE A 20-POUND
WEIGHT VEST.
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S
JUST LIKE THE OLD ANKLE WEIGHTS
THAT WE USED TO WEAR
WHEN WE WERE KIDS
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIGHTER?
EXACTLY, BUT -- RIGHT.
ANKLE WEIGHTS
AND WRIST WEIGHTS --
SO, WAIT. YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
A VALUATION OF --
WHAT IS IT --
Herjavec: $10 MILLION, MARK.
PATRICK, CAN I SEE ONE?
THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
HOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH?
IT ACTUALLY WEIGHS 8 POUNDS.
WE ALSO HAVE WEIGHTED SHORTS
THAT ARE ABOUT 5 POUNDS.
THEY'RE WEIGHTED WEIGHTS THAT
YOU CAN PUT IN CLOTHING THAT --
THOSE HAVE BEEN AROUND
FOR YEARS, RIGHT?
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THIS IS A LITTLE BETTER DESIGN?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
WEARING A WEIGHT VEST
APPLIES ALL THE WEIGHT
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I WAS ALWAYS
THE SKINNY KID IN SCHOOL. YEAH.
AND I USED TO OVERSTUFF MY BOOK
BAG WITH BOOKS
AND DO SHOULDER SHRUGS ON
THE WAY TO CLASS, TRYING
TO BULK UP MY SHOULDERS.
THE PROBLEM THAT I REALIZE
IS THAT
APPLYING ALL THE WEIGHT
ON YOUR SHOULDERS
ACTUALLY RUINS YOUR POSTURE
AND CAUSES YOU TO SLOUCH.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKING?
SO, LAST MONTH, WE ALMOST BROKE
$1 MILLION IN REVENUE.
WHAT? WOW.
LAST MONTH?
LAST MONTH ALONE, YEAH.
$1 MILLION?
OKAY.
THE SALES ARE IMPRESSIVE.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
I'M A MECHANICAL ENGINEER
FROM GEORGIA TECH.
I SPECIALIZE IN BIOMECHANICS,
AND I ACTUALLY DEVELOPED THIS
WHILE I WAS IN SCHOOL.
AND WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
THIS STUFF?
MAINLY ONLINE RETAILERS.
WE'RE NOW TALKING WITH MULTIPLE
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES.
WE JUST SOLD TO THE LARGEST
MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY
IN THE UNITED STATES.
SO, LAST YEAR,
HOW MUCH DID YOU DO?
WE DID ABOUT $600,000
IN REVENUE.
WHAT DID YOU NET
OFF OF THAT?
LAST YEAR
WAS AN INTERESTING STORY.
IN 2012, I ACTUALLY CLOSED A
DEAL WITH A VENTURE CAPITALIST.
THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS IN
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY
FOR US TO ACTUALLY BRING ON
AN EXECUTIVE CHAIR.
WE BURNED THROUGH THE ENTIRE
INVESTMENT WITHIN SIX MONTHS.
HOW MUCH
WAS THE INVESTMENT?
IT WAS ABOUT $1 MILLION.
WHAT -- THIS GUY BLEW THROUGH
THE MONEY. WHAT DID HE DO WRONG?
THERE WERE CHARGES THAT
I WOULDN'T HAVE --
I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE.
THERE WERE DECISIONS THAT
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE.
HOWEVER, AS OF LAST WEEK,
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM OUT.
OKAY. WHERE DID YOU GET
THE CAPITAL TO BUY THEM OUT?
ACTUALLY FROM SALES.
WE'RE ABOUT 30% NET PROFIT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DEBT?
WE HAVE NO DEBT.
DO YOU OWN 100%
OF THE EQUITY NOW?
BETWEEN ME AND MY FATHER,
WE OWN 100% OF THE EQUITY.
WHAT WILL THE SALES BE
THIS YEAR, PATRICK?
WE'RE LOOKING AT BREAKING
$10 MILLION THIS YEAR.
WOW.
POSSIBLY $16 MILLION,
DEPENDING ON INVENTORY.
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE SOLD OUT.
LOOK, PATRICK, MY B.S. METER
IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF.
BECAUSE I SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
"PATRICK SAYS
HE CAN INCREASE
OUR VERTICAL LEAPS OF ALL OF OUR
PLAYERS BY 13%."
THAT'S THE TRUTH?
YEAH, THE RESEARCH STUDIES
ARE PROVEN.
WE'VE HAD STUDIES
FROM TEXAS TECH,
PENN STATE,
MULTIPLE OTHER UNIVERSITIES.
AND WHAT WAS
THE RESEARCH INTO?
USING WEIGHT
TO INCREASE MAX VERT
OR TO INCREASE YOUR MAX VO2 --
THAT'S NOTHING NEW.
THAT'S LIKE -- THAT'S ANYTHING.
BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS WE'VE MADE IT BETTER.
AGAIN, YOU GAVE ME
AN ANECDOTAL EXAMPLE, RIGHT?
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. YEAH.
WHY NOT
GET SOMEBODY TO SAY,
"THIS IS WHY
WE'RE A BETTER SOLUTION"?
WE ARE GETTING THAT RESEARCH
FROM MULTIPLE UNIVERSITIES.
SEE, MY [BLEEP] METER'S
GOING NUTS!
RIGHT? BECAUSE
WHY NOT JUST HAVE
ONE UNIVERSITY STUDY IT IN-DEPTH
AND COME BACK WITH AN ANSWER?
BUT WHEN YOU SAY,
"THIS UNIVERSITY, THIS --"
BUT IT'S ALSO
A MARKETING EFFORT, AS WELL.
WE'RE NOW EXPOSING
MORE UNIVERSITIES
AND MORE COLLEGES...
I'M OUT.
Herjavec: PATRICK...
OKAY.
...LET ME TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT
IT. YOU'RE STRADDLING THE LINE.
MARK HAS REAL ATHLETES,
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES,
PROFESSIONAL DOCTORS.
EITHER YOU'RE IN THAT MARKET,
WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF CREDIBILITY
THAT YOU CAN STAND UP
TO CLAIMS LIKE THAT...
YEAH.
...OR YOU SAY,
"THIS IS PURPOSELY GEARED
TOWARDS THE WEEKEND ATHLETE,"
LIKE ME.
MY CHALLENGE IS,
YOU'RE VERY UNCLEAR.
EVASIVE ANSWERS --
I'M NOT TRYING
TO DO THAT AT ALL.
I MEAN, WE'VE --
WE'VE HAD ALL THE RESEARCH
VALIDATED WITH UNDER ARMOUR.
BUT SEE? OKAY.
YEAH?
EVEN WHEN YOU SAY THAT,
YOU'RE MAKING GENERALIZATIONS.
YOU DON'T POINT
TO SPECIFICS.
YOU MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE,
AND IF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THE PERSON...
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,
I'M NOT A SPORTS GUY.
I LOOK AT IT AS A CONSUMER.
IF I WERE A GUY,
AND I WASN'T BUFF,
I'D WEAR THAT INTO THE GYM,
AND I'D FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF.
BUT IT'S NOT HITTING ME
AS SOMETHING
THAT I WANT TO INVEST IN,
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
OKAY, FORGET
ALL THE RESEARCH STUFF.
WHAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON,
I BELIEVE, IS SALES.
YOU HAVE SALES.
TO ME, IT'S APPAREL --
MAYBE EXTREME APPAREL.
AND IT HAS THE MERITS AND THE
RISKS OF THE APPAREL INDUSTRY.
SO I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $500,000
FOR 15%.
VALUE'S AT AROUND
$3.3 MILLION.
I THINK IT'S INTRIGUING
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, YOU KNOW?
AND YOUR STYLE IS --
YOU KIND OF FIT INTO
THE ARROGANT ASS FACTOR.
[ CUBAN LAUGHS ]
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE FRIENDS.
YOU WANT A FRIEND,
BUY A DOG.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE MONEY,
OKAY?
I CAN BE YOUR INVESTOR.
MAYBE WE <i>WILL</i>
BE FRIENDS.
WHO KNOWS? BUT YOU ARE
A BIT OF A [BLEEP]
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T CARE. LOOK.
YOU NEED HONEST PARTNERS.
I'M ONE OF THOSE.
ALL RIGHT?
OH, MY GOD.
Whaley: WELL, I MEAN...
I'M SINCERELY SORRY THAT YOU
FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.
DON'T FEEL SORRY!
BUT THERE IS AN OFFER THERE --
$500,000 FOR 15%.
UM...
I DON'T HEAR
ANY OTHER OFFERS.
I'M GONNA PUT
AN OFFER ON THE TABLE.
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M HAVING THE SAME CHALLENGE
THAT THE OTHER SHARKS
ARE HAVING.
I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD TRUST YOU OR NOT.
WELL, I AM AN EAGLE SCOUT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
BEFORE I MAKE THE OFFER,
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO UTILIZE
THE MONEY FOR?
INVENTORY. WE ARE COMPLETELY
SOLD OUT. WE GET INVENTORY IN,
AND IN 24 HOURS, IT'S GONE.
OKAY,
THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM.
SO I'M -- I'M WILLING
TO GIVE YOU THE 500K FOR 20%.
THAT'S HIGHER
THAN KEVIN'S.
YES, BECAUSE I'M WILLING
TO HANDLE THE INVENTORY
AND HANDLE THE PRODUCTION.
HMM.
ALL RIGHT, PATRICK,
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
TIME TO MAKE A DECISION.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
PATRICK HAS TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE --
$500,000 FOR A 15% STAKE
FROM KEVIN,
AND $500,000 FOR A 20% STAKE
FROM DAYMOND.
UM...
HE'S TRYING TO LIVE UP
TO THE CLAIMS.
PATRICK,
DON'T LET THE FLOOR
GET AWAY FROM YOU.
YOU'VE GOT
TWO OFFERS HERE.
MARK STARTED TO TALK.
DON'T LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY.
EITHER COUNTER
OR TAKE THE DEAL.
I'M FINE
WITH A $5-MILLION VALUATION
IF WE CAN TRY TO GET THERE.
IF WE CAN GET THERE,
WE'RE ALREADY GROWING --
PATRICK, STOP SELLING.
I MEAN, DAYMOND, LOOK.
YOU'RE IN THE APPAREL INDUSTRY.
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL YOU
IT COULDN'T BE DONE.
I NEED YOU
TO BELIEVE IN ME.
I KNOW
I CAN GET THIS DONE.
I'D LOVE
TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.
YOU'D LOVE TO HAVE ME ON BOARD
FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
WELL --
MY $500,000 IS MY BUY-IN
TO HELP YOU PRODUCE AND
MANUFACTURE AND RUN EVERYTHING.
I THINK HE SAID NO, DAYMOND.
HE MADE YOU A COUNTER.
I DON'T WANT
TO SAY NO TO ANYBODY. I'M --
10%? IT'S NOT ENOUGH EQUITY.
IT'S TOO SMALL.
I'M GONNA STICK AT 15%.
IT'S REASONABLE.
IT'S A $3.3-MILL
VALUATION.
WOULD YOU MIND DOING IT
AT $750,000 FOR 15%?
NO.
$500,000 IS A LOT OF CASH.
ALL RIGHT, SO, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
STICK TO 20%.
PATRICK,
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
[ SIGHS ]
UM...
DAYMOND...
...I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOUR OFFER.
OH.
ALL RIGHT.
WOW.
WOW.
NICE.
GOOD DEAL.
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE
COMING HERE NOT TO MAKE A DEAL.
NO, I WANTED TO MAKE A DEAL.
ACTUALLY, I PICKED YOU.
I WANTED TO DO A DEAL.
WHY WERE YOU BEING
SO DIFFICULT?
I WASN'T TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT.
I MEAN, WE HAVE --
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROOF
AND VALIDATION.
IT'S BECAUSE THEY
SCREWED YOU OVER THE FIRST TIME.
YEAH. YEAH.
RIGHT? I GOT YOU.
I WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
VALIDATE THIS STUFF,
ALL RIGHT?
IT'S ALL VALIDATED.
AND WE'RE GONNA
PROVE THESE GUYS WRONG.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
KEVIN,
YOU ARE MR. WONDERFUL.
I KNOW THAT WITH CERTAINTY.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, ALL.
THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT GOING INTO THE SHARK TANK
IS YOU HAVE A SPLIT SECOND
TO MAKE A DECISION.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT WAS EXTREMELY FEROCIOUS,
AND, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I MADE A DEAL WITH DAYMOND,
AND IT WAS PROBABLY
THE BEST DEAL I'VE EVER DONE.
SO, YOU FELT COMFORTABLE
PARTNERING WITH HIM.
DOES HE HAVE $1 MILLION IN SALES
OR NOT?
HE WAS ROMANCING THE TRUTH.
LISTEN, MAYBE HE'S A JERK,
BUT NOW HE'S <i>MY</i> JERK.
Narrator: IN SEASON 5, WE
WATCHED MELISSA AND RICK HINNANT
MAKE A DEAL
WITH BARBARA CORCORAN
FOR THEIR FASHION SOCK COMPANY,
GRACE AND LACE.
WE CAME IN WITH A STRATEGY,
AND WE KNEW WHO WE WANTED.
LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT BARBARA
WOULD MAKE
THE PERFECT PARTNER FOR US.
Melissa: NOT ONLY HAS SHE
GIVEN US INCREDIBLE ADVICE,
SHE HAS OPENED UP INCREDIBLE
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR US.
JOANNA?
BARBARA CORCORAN.
BARBARA CORCORAN.
HOW VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
I BROUGHT MELISSA AND RICK
TO MEET JOANNA COLES,
THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
OF <i>COSMOPOLITAN</i> MAGAZINE.
WE'VE GOT A FEW SAMPLES
WE BROUGHT FOR YOU TODAY.
Corcoran: <i>COSMOPOLITAN</i> HAS
17 MILLION READERS A MONTH.
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
WE'VE DECIDED
TO FEATURE GRACE AND LACE
IN OUR FEBRUARY ISSUE.
Melissa: THIS IS HUGE.
I MEAN, THE CHANCE
FOR OUR BRAND TO BE
IN A MAJOR MAGAZINE LIKE THIS
BLOWS MY MIND.
A YEAR BEFORE
"SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD DONE A LITTLE OVER
$1 MILLION IN SALES.
NOT EVEN A YEAR LATER, WE HAVE
OVER $6.5 MILLION IN SALES.
WE ARE ECSTATIC ABOUT
WHAT BARBARA HAS DONE FOR US
AND THE REACH
THAT THIS COULD PROVIDE.
THESE ARE FABULOUS.
[ MAN SPEAKS HINDI ]
[ CROWD CHEERING ]
Melissa: THE GREATEST THING
ABOUT OUR SUCCESS
IS THAT IT HAS POSITIONED US
TO GIVE BACK.
WE RECENTLY WENT TO INDIA
TO OPEN TWO GRACE AND LACE
ORPHANAGES.
WE WERE ABLE
TO TAKE 100 KIDS OFF THE STREETS
AND GIVE THEM FOOD, A BED.
IT'S A CAUSE
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO US.
WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE
A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD.
WE CHASED OUR DREAMS, AND NOW
WE'RE SEEING THEM COME TRUE.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FEELING.
