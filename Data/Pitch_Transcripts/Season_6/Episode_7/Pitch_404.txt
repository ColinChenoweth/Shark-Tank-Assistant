HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S TALIA GOLDFARB,
AND THIS IS MY FRIEND TEGAN.
HI.
Herjavec: HI.
I'M SEEKING $60,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY,
MYSELF BELTS, THE BELT
KIDS CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES.
AS YOU KNOW, A TODDLER'S
FAVORITE WORDS ARE...
"ALL MY MYSELF."
[ LAUGHTER ]
THESE WORDS
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE TRUE,
WHEN I WAS POTTY-TRAINING
MY 2-YEAR-OLD SON JAKE.
HE WAS DOING SO WELL
WITH HIS NEWFOUND INDEPENDENCE,
AND I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE PROUD.
BUT WITHOUT THE BULK OF A
DIAPER, HIS PANTS NO LONGER FIT.
HE WOULD RUN AND PLAY WITH
ONE HAND HOLDING UP HIS PANTS.
IT WAS RIDICULOUS, AND NOTHING
EXISTED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
I NEEDED A BELT
THAT WAS EASY FOR JAKE TO USE,
WOULD KEEP HIS PANTS IN PLACE,
AND COULD BE QUICKLY UNDONE
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
WHEN HE WAS <i>RACING</i>
TO THE BATHROOM.
[ LAUGHS ]
DROOPY DRAWERS...
NO MORE.
OUR BELT SERVES THE ROLE
OF A REGULAR BELT,
COMPLEMENTS ANY OUTFIT,
BUT THE CLOSURE CAN BE DONE
WITH ONE HAND.
Both: TA-DA!
Herjavec: OH, COOL.
Greiner: AWW.
SINCE WE LAUNCHED,
WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS,
BUT THERE ARE MANY AVENUES
FOR GROWTH,
SUCH AS LICENSING,
THE UNIFORM MARKET,
AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION.
WE KNOW THAT YOUR EXPERTISE
CAN HELP GET US THERE.
WHO WANTS TO CINCH UP A DEAL?
ME!
[ LAUGHTER ]
TEGAN, YOU WANT TO
PASS OUT THE BELTS?
TEGAN'S GONNA GIVE ALL OF YOU
A BELT TO LOOK AT.
TEGAN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Greiner: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HOW OLD ARE YOU, TEGAN?
5.
5! WOW.
AWW.
I LIKE <i>YOUR</i> BELT.
IT'S GOT PIRATES ON IT.
DAYMOND,
WHY ARE THEY CALLED PIRATES?
'CAUSE THEY "ARR."
[are]
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK
THIS IS TOO SMALL FOR ME.
Goldfarb: OKAY, SO,
THE PARENT IN THE MORNING
SNAPS THE BELT
AROUND THE BELT LOOP,
AND IT BECOMES ATTACHED
TO THE PANTS.
THEN IT WEAVES THROUGH THE LOOPS
LIKE A REGULAR BELT,
AND THE CHILD CAN OPEN AND CLOSE
IT WITH ONE HAND AS YOU SAW.
SO IT KEEPS THEIR PANTS
IN PLACE,
ALWAYS CINCHES
TO THE RIGHT SPOT,
ALWAYS KEEPS THEIR PANTS UP,
AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL,
"I DID IT MYSELF" MOMENT.
ALL RIGHT, TEGAN.
CAN YOU SAY BYE TO THE SHARKS?
BYE, SHARKS.
GIVE HER A DEAL.
TALIA, YOU'VE <i>ALWAYS</i> BEEN
AT THE POINT
WHERE YOU'VE NEEDED
A PARTNER, RIGHT?
MAYBE SO.
YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH HAD THE SAME
AMOUNT OF SALES EVERY YEAR.
SO MANY STORES HAVE CLOSED.
AND I FEEL LIKE MY STRATEGY
TO WAIT THAT OUT INSTEAD OF
CONTINUING TO BANG ON DOORS --
WAIT FOR WHAT?
WAIT FOR THAT --
WAIT FOR THAT --
WHAT FOR THAT --
WAIT -- WAIT FOR MORE BOUTIQUES
TO OPEN UP? WAIT -- WAIT --
WAIT FOR THAT WHOLESALE SIDE
TO BE OPEN TO TALKING TO PEOPLE,
WHICH THEY ARE NOW.
OKAY, SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THE BUSINESS IS DECLINING,
AND YOU JUST WANT TO
WAIT FOR IT TO COME BACK?
NO, WE'RE -- WE --
WE'RE FOCUSING ONLINE.
IF A PRODUCT IS A GREAT PRODUCT,
WHETHER THE MARKET'S CRASHED,
ECONOMY'S BAD,
A GOOD PRODUCT SURVIVES
AND ACTUALLY
CONTINUES TO THRIVE.
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
I THINK HERE IS REALLY LACKING
IS YOUR DRIVE AND DETERMINATION
TO, NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES,
EVERY MORNING,
YOU WAKE UP WITH,
"YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS ISN'T
WORKING, BUT I'M GONNA DO THIS.
"I DON'T CARE WHAT OBSTACLES
ARE IN MY WAY.
IT'S NOT WHO'S GOING TO LET ME,
IT'S WHO'S GOING TO <i>STOP</i> ME."
I DON'T SEE THAT IN YOU.
I'M OUT.
TALIA, LET ME TELL YOU
WHERE I'M AT.
THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF WARRIORS.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO SIT ON TOP OF THE HILL
AND BE STRATEGIC,
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO ARE IN THERE FIGHTING
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.
SOMETIMES,
YOU GOT TO DO BOTH.
SURE.
YOU'RE UP HERE.
I'M NOT --
WHEN I STARTED MY BUSINESS
10 YEARS AGO,
I THOUGHT WE WOULD DO $5 MILLION
IN SALES THE FIRST YEAR.
MY EGO'S THIS MASSIVE.
GUESS WHAT WE SOLD? $400,000.
SO GUESS WHAT I WAS DOING?
I WAS IN THERE
MAKING COLD CALLS,
GOING OUT THERE EVERY DAY.
YOU GOT TO HUSTLE.
WE'RE DOING A BIG 10-YEAR --
IT'S FOR OUR 10-YEAR LAUNCH.
NO, NO.
WE'RE DOING
A BIG MARKETING PUSH.
WE ARE ATTENDING TRADE SHOWS.
TALIA, STOP LOOKING
FOR THE POSITIVE. LOOK
FOR THE OBJECTIONS.
WELL, WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SHOW YOU IS THE OPPORTUNITY.
TALIA, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
NO, I AM.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN SEE
THE OPPORTUNITY.
YOU KNOW WHAT? THE WORST LIES
YOU TELL IN LIFE ARE THE ONES
YOU TELL YOURSELF. AS
YOU'RE STANDING THERE,
YOU'RE SELLING YOURSELF.
I'M TRYING TO SELL YOU
ON OUR GREAT PRODUCT THAT --
TALIA, YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO HIM, RIGHT?
WE AGREE
YOU HAVE A GREAT PRODUCT.
BUT YOU --
WE'VE ALL SAID THAT, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
O'Leary: I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE
MARKET. YOU DIDN'T SAY
IT WASN'T A GOOD PRODUCT.
THE MARKET SAYS
THIS PRODUCT'S $200,000 A YEAR.
POTTY-TRAINING'S
A $500-MILLION INDUSTRY.
YEAH, YEAH.
BUT NOT THIS ONE.
OKAY.
I-I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
MORE OPPORTUNITY.
I'M OUT.
I -- OKAY.
Cuban: I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE, RIGHT?
I-I DON'T. I WANT YOU
TO BE SUCCESSFUL, RIGHT?
I SEE -- I SEE
THE FOUNDATION OF A BUSINESS.
AT LEAST
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
I DO.
BUT YOU'RE NOT A KILLER.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
DAYMOND, I-I THINK
YOU'D BE AN AMAZING PARTNER.
YOU'RE WHO I CAME HERE HOPING
WOULD BE INTRIGUED
BY WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR.
I KNOW YOU INVESTED
IN MISSION BELTS.
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO BECOME A BELT MOGUL.
AND I WOULD -- I WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME.
I KNOW OUR PRODUCT.
I KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS.
OKAY.
I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE LIKE
ABOUT IT.
[ SIGHS ]
Narrator:
FOUR SHARKS ARE OUT.
TALIA HAS ONE LAST CHANCE
TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR HER CHILDREN'S BELT COMPANY,
MYSELF BELTS.
DAYMOND, I WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME.
I-I KNOW OUR PRODUCT.
I KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS.
OKAY.
I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE LIKE
ABOUT IT.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
I KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT GROW.
[ SIGHS ]
SO, THE LAST FIVE YEARS,
YOU CAME INTO, BASICALLY,
A RECESSION.
YOU PIVOTED. YOU MOVED AROUND.
YOU FIGURED A WAY
TO THEN GO ON TO HOW ONLINE
IS THRIVING RIGHT NOW,
AND YOU STAYED
AROUND THE SAME NUMBER.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THESE GUYS
ARE TALKING ABOUT, ALL RIGHT?
BUT THAT'S TYPICAL.
HE RARELY DOES.
Herjavec: TALIA, REALLY?
THE 5% IS GONNA --
OH, MY GOSH.
I-I -- I'M JUST --
I'M JUST ASKING.
O'Leary: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO STRING YOU UP
Goldfarb: I FEEL LIKE
I WAS JUST IN A FISTFIGHT.
IT WAS UNEXPECTED, 'CAUSE I'VE
WORKED SO HARD. I KNOW WHO I AM.
BUT WHEN DAYMOND CAME IN
AND SWOOPED IN, I FELT SO GOOD.
