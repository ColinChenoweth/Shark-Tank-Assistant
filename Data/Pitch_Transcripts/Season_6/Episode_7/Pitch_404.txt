HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS PATRICK WHALEY,
PATRICK, CAN I SEE ONE?
THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
HOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH?
IT ACTUALLY WEIGHS 8 POUNDS.
WE ALSO HAVE WEIGHTED SHORTS
THAT ARE ABOUT 5 POUNDS.
THEY'RE WEIGHTED WEIGHTS THAT
YOU CAN PUT IN CLOTHING THAT --
THOSE HAVE BEEN AROUND
FOR YEARS, RIGHT?
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THIS IS A LITTLE BETTER DESIGN?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
WEARING A WEIGHT VEST
APPLIES ALL THE WEIGHT
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I WAS ALWAYS
THE SKINNY KID IN SCHOOL. YEAH.
WHAT WILL THE SALES BE
THIS YEAR, PATRICK?
WE'RE LOOKING AT BREAKING
$10 MILLION THIS YEAR.
WOW.
POSSIBLY $16 MILLION,
DEPENDING ON INVENTORY.
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE SOLD OUT.
LOOK, PATRICK, MY B.S. METER
IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF.
BECAUSE I SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
"PATRICK SAYS
HE CAN INCREASE
OUR VERTICAL LEAPS OF ALL OF OUR
PLAYERS BY 13%."
THAT'S THE TRUTH?
YEAH, THE RESEARCH STUDIES
ARE PROVEN.
WE'VE HAD STUDIES
FROM TEXAS TECH,
PENN STATE,
MULTIPLE OTHER UNIVERSITIES.
Herjavec: PATRICK...
OKAY.
...LET ME TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT
IT. YOU'RE STRADDLING THE LINE.
MARK HAS REAL ATHLETES,
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES,
PROFESSIONAL DOCTORS.
EITHER YOU'RE IN THAT MARKET,
WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF CREDIBILITY
OH, MY GOD.
Whaley: WELL, I MEAN...
I'M SINCERELY SORRY THAT YOU
FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.
DON'T FEEL SORRY!
BUT THERE IS AN OFFER THERE --
$500,000 FOR 15%.
UM...
I DON'T HEAR
ANY OTHER OFFERS.
I'M GONNA PUT
AN OFFER ON THE TABLE.
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M HAVING THE SAME CHALLENGE
THAT THE OTHER SHARKS
ARE HAVING.
I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD TRUST YOU OR NOT.
WELL, I AM AN EAGLE SCOUT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
BEFORE I MAKE THE OFFER,
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO UTILIZE
THE MONEY FOR?
INVENTORY. WE ARE COMPLETELY
SOLD OUT. WE GET INVENTORY IN,
ALL RIGHT, PATRICK,
YOU'VE GOT TWO OFFERS.
TIME TO MAKE A DECISION.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
PATRICK HAS TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE --
$500,000 FOR A 15% STAKE
FROM KEVIN,
HE'S TRYING TO LIVE UP
TO THE CLAIMS.
PATRICK,
DON'T LET THE FLOOR
GET AWAY FROM YOU.
YOU'VE GOT
TWO OFFERS HERE.
MARK STARTED TO TALK.
DON'T LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY.
EITHER COUNTER
OR TAKE THE DEAL.
I'M FINE
WITH A $5-MILLION VALUATION
IF WE CAN TRY TO GET THERE.
IF WE CAN GET THERE,
WE'RE ALREADY GROWING --
PATRICK, STOP SELLING.
I MEAN, DAYMOND, LOOK.
YOU'RE IN THE APPAREL INDUSTRY.
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL YOU
IT COULDN'T BE DONE.
I NEED YOU
TO BELIEVE IN ME.
I KNOW
I CAN GET THIS DONE.
I'D LOVE
TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.
YOU'D LOVE TO HAVE ME ON BOARD
FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
WELL --
MY $500,000 IS MY BUY-IN

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
[ SIGHS ]

DAYMOND...
...I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOUR OFFER.
OH.

I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE
COMING HERE NOT TO MAKE A DEAL.
NO, I WANTED TO MAKE A DEAL.
ACTUALLY, I PICKED YOU.

WHY WERE YOU BEING
SO DIFFICULT?
I WASN'T TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT.
I MEAN, WE HAVE --
