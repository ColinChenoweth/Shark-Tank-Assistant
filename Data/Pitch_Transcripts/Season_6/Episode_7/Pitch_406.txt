AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS AN INNOVATIVE WAY
TO GET THE MOST
OUT OF YOUR WORKOUTS.
IT'S ALL BASED ON YOU HITTING
A STRATOSPHERIC GROWTH RATE.
WE'VE ALREADY HIT IT.
WE'VE HAD --
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T HIT IT.
YOU HAVEN'T HIT IT.
AND SO I HAVE TO PAY
FOR NEXT YEAR'S SALES
AS IF THEY'VE ALREADY
OCCURRED TODAY.
I WANT ALL MY GUYS ON THE
MAVERICKS TO JUMP 13% HIGHER."
OKAY, GREAT.
I BRING YOU TO THE MAVERICKS,
SIT WITH MY DOCTOR.
WE CAN MAKE THIS THING
A STRATOSPHERIC SUCCESS.
I'M ERIC BANDHOLZ,
AND I'M A BEARDSMAN
FROM SPOKANE, WASHINGTON.
I TOTALLY LIVE THE BEARDED
LIFESTYLE ALL THE TIME,
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO
TAKE CARE OF A BEAUTY LIKE THIS.
THE BEST PART OF HAVING
A BEARD THIS AWESOME --
BEING ABLE TO SHOW IT OFF.
THE BEST PLACE FOR THAT
IS A BEARD AND MOUSTACHE
COMPETITION.
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
ARE YOU GUYS FROM HERE?
I DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE THIS
BEAUTIFUL FACE MANE RIGHT HERE.
I USED TO WORK AS A FINANCIAL
ADVISOR AT A BIG BANK.
THEIR POLICY WAS NO FACIAL HAIR.
I LEFT MY JOB 'CAUSE I'M A
BEARDSMAN, AND IT'S IN MY BLOOD,
AND THAT'S WHEN I HAD
A GLORIOUS IDEA.
THERE'S ALL TYPES
OF BEARDSMEN OUT THERE.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE BRAND
TO UNITE THEM...UNTIL NOW.
I'VE BEEN GROWING OUR BUSINESS
ORGANICALLY THROUGH OUR PROFITS,
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO PAY MYSELF A DIME.
SO MUCH OF BEING A MAN
IS PROVIDING FOR YOUR FAMILY,
AND IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
A CHIP ON MY SHOULDER
UNTIL I CAN BRING IN
THE SUPPORT MY FAMILY NEEDS.
WITH THE SHARKS' INVESTMENT,
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
All: BEARDSMEN!
WHAT'S GOING ON, SHARKS?
IT IS YOUR BOY, ERIC BANDHOLZ,
WITH BEARDBRAND...
[ CHUCKLES ]
...COMING TO YOU TODAY
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY
TO PURCHASE 15% OF OUR BUSINESS
FOR $400,000.
NOW, DAYMOND, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN 2012,
BUT I, MYSELF,
WAS AT A BEARD COMPETITION,
AND I LEARNED
A VERY IMPORTANT THING.
SEE, BACK THEN,
BEARDSMEN WERE THOUGHT OF
AS LUMBERJACKS OR HIPPIES.
AND WHAT I NOTICED
WAS A NEW TYPE OF BEARDSMAN,
SOMETHING WE COINED
THE URBAN BEARDSMAN.
NOW, THESE WERE MEN
WHO WERE PASSIONATE
NOT ONLY
ABOUT THEIR FACIAL HAIR,
BUT ALSO THEIR STYLE,
THEIR CAREERS,
AND THEIR INDEPENDENCE.
SO WE UNITED THE COMMUNITY
AND STARTED OFFERING THEM
SOME REALLY AWESOME PRODUCTS.
BEARD OIL
WILL SOFTEN UP YOUR BEARD,
HELP ELIMINATE BEARD FLAKES,
AND...
[ SNIFFS ]
WHOO-HOO-HOO!
IT SMELLS FANTASTIC.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS DROP
A COUPLE DROPS IN YOUR HAND...
RUB IT INTO THE BEARD...
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ Quietly ] NO.
NOW, WE ARE IN THE RENAISSANCE
OF A FACIAL-HAIR REVOLUTION.
AND BEARDBRAND
IS LEADING THE CHARGE.
WE SEE A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
IN THE MARKETPLACE,
AND WITH YOUR PARTNERSHIP,
WE WILL CHANGE
THE WAY SOCIETY VIEWS BEARDSMEN.
SO, ERIC,
CAN WE SEE THE PRODUCT?
YEAH, YOU CAN, ROBERT.
THANK YOU.
I CAN SMELL IT
OVER HERE.
Greiner: SO, TRIMMERS.
SCISSORS.
Bandholz:
SO, THIS IS, LIKE, THE ULTIMATE
KIT ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET,
ALL RIGHT?
WE SPARED NO EXPENSE THERE.
WE GOT FINE,
BLACK-WALNUT CORNERS.
WE'VE GOT
INCREDIBLE PRODUCTS.
OKAY, SO,
DO YOU HAVE ANY SALES?
DO WE HAVE SALES?
ABSOLUTELY.
SO, WHAT I NEED TO HEAR
IS YOU'VE GOT SOME REVENUE
BEFORE I ABSOLUTELY
GO TO TOWN ON YOU.
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $2.6 MILLION
FOR YOUR BEARDBRAND
BOX OF STUFF.
YEAH, I THINK MY VALUATION
IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.
WELL, TELL ME MORE.
SO, WE ACTUALLY LAUNCHED
THIS BUSINESS 17 MONTHS AGO.
SO, THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS,
WE DID $9,000 IN SALES.
THE SECOND SIX MONTHS,
WE DID $188,000.
BETTER.
AND THE MOST RECENT,
WE DID OVER $600,000.
WOW.
SO, ALL TOTAL,
WE'VE DONE OVER $800,000.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY,
IT SURPRISES ME
BECAUSE I KNOW
IT'S BACK IN STYLE.
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
THAT GO THROUGH MY MIND
AS A FEMALE
ABOUT A BEARD LIKE THAT.
LIKE WHAT?
LIKE WHAT, LORI?
LORI,
EVERYBODY'S INTRIGUED NOW.
CAN I TOUCH IT?
YEAH, COME ON UP!
SCRATCH THAT PUPPY,
LORI.
LORI, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
TOUCH THE PEOPLE.
Greiner:
OH, MY GOD. [ LAUGHS ]
[ Chuckling ]
IT'S A LITTLE --
IT'S A LITTLE LIKE...
LORI, WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?
COME ON UP.
YOU CAN ALL TOUCH IT.
I'M NOT TOUCHING
NO OTHER MAN'S BEARD!
WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?
DAYMOND, ARE YOU NOT COMFORTABLE
TOUCHING ANOTHER MAN'S BEARD?
NO! I'M NOT TOUCHING
NO <i>WOMAN'S</i> BEARD, EITHER,
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT!
LORI, SIT DOWN!
Bandholz: THE REASON I HAVE A
BEARD IS BECAUSE, DOWN THE LINE,
MY MOM, MY GRANDMA -- THEY ALL
DIG THE DUDE WITH THE BEARD.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO CHICKS DIG BEARDS. THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. WHAT --
LIKE, THINK ABOUT IT.
OF ALL THE ANIMALS OUT THERE,
HUMANS ARE ONE OF THE FEW BREEDS
THAT ACTUALLY GROW FACIAL HAIR.
IT'S A SIGN OF LOVE AND PASSION
THAT WOMEN ARE ATTRACTED TO.
HMM.
Greiner:
IS THERE SOMETHING IN THAT OIL
THAT WILL, LIKE, KEEP FOOD
FROM GETTING STUCK IN IT?
ERIC, ARE YOU SELLING THIS
ONLINE? IS THIS IN RETAIL?
SO, WE LAUNCHED
WITH AN ONLINE STORE.
O'Leary:
WHAT WILL SALES BE THIS CALENDAR
YEAR? I HAD A LOT OF HAIR ONCE.
THEN I RAN INTO DEALS LIKE THIS,
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY, SO LET'S GO. LET'S GO.
WHAT'S THE CALENDAR YEAR?
IT'D BE $1.2 MILLION,
AT LEAST.
AND HOW MUCH WOULD YOU MAKE?
OUR NET PROFIT IS 25%.
BUT YOU'RE PUTTING A VALUE ON
YOUR BUSINESS OF $2.6 MILLION.
ERIC, YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF
HIGH-QUALITY STUFF IN HERE.
WHAT'S IT COST YOU TO MAKE?
THAT'S ABOUT $170,
AND THAT'LL COST US
ABOUT 60 OR 70 BUCKS.
HOW LOW
CAN YOU GET YOUR COST?
OUR BEARD OIL
IS THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES.
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS
IS THE OIL?
PROBABLY ABOUT 60%.
WOW.
WOW. AND WHAT'S YOUR MARGIN
ON THE OIL?
SO, WE RETAIL THESE
ANYWHERE FROM $20 TO $30,
AND THEN OUR MARGIN
IS BETWEEN 85% AND 90%.
WHY YOU DOING
ALL THIS OTHER MISHEGOSS
WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT'S 80% MARGIN,
THAT IF YOU
KEEP YOUR BEARD,
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP ON
REPLENISHING IT AND BUYING MORE?
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, IT'D TAKE NOTHING TO
STORE AND SHIP ALL THAT STUFF.
THE BIG THING FOR US
IS BUILDING A BRAND
AND BEING MORE
THAN JUST A PRODUCT COMPANY.
BUT -- BUT YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT, RIGHT?
YOU'RE --
YOU'RE GOING HIGH END,
AND IT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT TO SCALE.
YOU MIGHT GET
THE $5 MILLION IN SALES,
BUT AT THAT POINT
IN TIME,
IT'S HARD FOR US
TO GET OUR MONEY BACK.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OUT ALREADY.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
I'M NOT A BEARD GUY.
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.
FOR A COMPANY TO GO
FROM ZERO TO OVER $100,000
PER MONTH IN SALES,
I'M SURE YOU GUYS
DON'T SEE A LOT OF THAT.
LOOK, YOU'RE DOING WELL,
BUT WHAT'S THE MARKET FOR THIS?
NOT FOR WOMEN, NOT FOR KIDS,
NOT FOR MEN WITHOUT BEARDS.
SO THE ONLY THING THAT CAME
INTO MY MIND WAS THE AMISH,
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TVs,
SO I'M OUT.
SO, HOW DO I GET
MY $400,000 BACK?
THAT'S A LOT OF DOUGH,
MY FRIEND.
YOUR BUSINESS IS WORTH
ABOUT $500,000 TO $600,000.
YOU'VE PRICED IT AT A CRAZY
VALUATION OF $2.6 MILLION.
I WOULD HAVE TO OWN
PRETTY WELL THE WHOLE THING,
AND THEN YOU'D BECOME
MY BEARD SLAVE. THAT'D BE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M OUT.
SO THAT LEAVES
THE FINAL BEARDSMAN,
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MAN
IN THE ROOM.
Greiner: OOH.
WHERE?
I LIKE THIS GUY.
I LIKE THIS GUY.
THIS GUY GETS THIS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
BIG GUY?
I-I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
YOU ARE THE BEARD WHISTLER.
YOU LIVE THIS LIFE.
I THINK YOU GO AND DO $2
MILLION, $3 MILLION, $4 MILLION.
I LOVE INVESTING IN <i>PEOPLE.</i>
SO I GOT CAUGHT UP.
I WAS ACTUALLY
GONNA GIVE YOU AN OFFER,
BUT THEN I HAD TO GO BACK
TO THE VALUATION.
I WOULDN'T GET
MY MONEY BACK
UNTIL MY BEARD WAS LONG
LIKE MOSES, RIGHT? SO...
I'M OUT.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK, MAN.
GOOD LUCK.
TAKE IT EASY.
AS A WOMAN,
I CAN'T <i>STAND</i> BEARDS LIKE THAT.
I REALLY CAN'T.
YOU WERE <i>DYING</i> TO GO UP THERE
AND TOUCH HIS BEARD.
LORI,
I THINK YOU LIKED HIM.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ERIC BERKOWITZ,
AND THE GUY
NEXT TO ME...
INTRODUCING,
FROM THE DALLAS MAVERICKS,
MR. MARK CUBAN!
BOO!
[ Auto-tuned ]
? FOR US, BY US, IT'S FUBU ?
YOU GUYS ARE GOOD AND TERRIBLE.
THEY'RE GOOD AND TERRIBLE.
? FUBU ?
[ Robotic voice ]
WARNING. WARNING.
BAD DEAL ALERT.
BAD DEAL ALERT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
[ Very deep voice ]
OH, HI, LORI.
YOU GOT
A BEAUTIFUL SMILE.
LET'S GET TOGETHER
AFTER THE SHOW.
I'LL SEE YOU OUTSIDE
LATER.
[ Normal voice ]
YOU LIKE TO PLAY GUITAR, RIGHT?
[ VOICE IMITATING
ELECTRIC GUITAR ]
[ High-pitched voice ]
CUT THE MUSIC.
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE
WITH THIS DEMONSTRATION.
WOW.
NICE.
