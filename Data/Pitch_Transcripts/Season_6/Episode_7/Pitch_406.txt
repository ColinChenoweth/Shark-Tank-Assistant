DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,
FOUNDED ONE OF
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
...$10 MILLION
FOR ANKLE WEIGHTS?
John: WAIT, WAIT.
DON'T BEAT THE GUY UP
JUST YET.
YOU GOT TO HAVE VISION.
IT'S ABOUT WHAT IT'S GONNA BE
WORTH NEXT YEAR.
John: YOU'RE GONNA BREAK
$10 MILLION THIS YEAR?
EASILY, YEAH.
EASILY?
SO, WHO'S
YOUR PRIMARY CUSTOMER?
THE MILITARY AND CrossFit.
AND THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY
HOW MUCH FOR A SHIRT?
RIGHT NOW, WE SELL
A THREE-PART SYSTEM FOR $250.
IT COMES AS A COVER SHIRT,
A POCKET SHIRT,
AND A FULL SET OF GEL.
HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL IT
TO THE STORES FOR?
$137 OR SO.
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE GONNA
HOCKEY-STICK
TO $10 MILLION?
WE HAVE ABOUT $1.4 MILLION
OF PURCHASE ORDERS
THAT I CAN'T FULFILL,
AND THE REASON
IS BECAUSE I'M TAKING
ALL THE PROFIT TO THEN BUY OUT
MY INVESTORS AND TRY TO --
TRY TO GET A CLEAN SLATE.
I'M STRUGGLING WITH YOUR
$10-MILLION VALUATION.
John: YOU CAN COUNTER.
YOU REALLY WOULD SELL
THESE THINGS TO PEOPLE?
SOME GUY'S GONNA JUST PUT THIS
THING ON, TRY TO DO TOO MUCH,
DROP DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK.
YOU HAVE THAT
IN ANY WEIGHT TRAINING.
YEAH, BUT, NO. BUT HE'S MAKING
CLAIMS, AND HE'S TRYING --
John: THANK YOU.
COMB.
[ SNIFFS ]
WHOA.
THIS STUFF SMELLS GREAT.
IS THIS KIT FOR GUYS
WITH, LIKE, SERIOUS BEARDS?
John: SO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA HANG OUT WITH HIM,
AND A CHICKEN WING'S GONNA
DROP OUT OF HIS BEARD?
OUR COMPANY
DOESN'T SELL $800,000
BY SELLING TO JUST GUYS
WITH GIANT BEARDS.
WE CATER
TO ALL BEARDS OF ALL LENGTHS.
John: YEAH.
I-I FELT THIS --
YOU WERE DOING
TOO MUCH GIGGLING.
YOU WERE LIKE
A LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL. "OOH!"
LOOK AT HER BLUSHING NOW.
OH, YEAH.
NO, NO, NO.
SHE WAS ALL OVER
THAT BEARD.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
ARE ENTREPRENEURS
WITH THE NEXT GENERATION
OF KARAOKE MACHINES.
MY NAME
IS JOHN DEVECKA.
AND TOGETHER
WE'RE COFOUNDERS
OF THE COMPANY SINGTRIX
FROM NEW YORK, NEW YORK.
WE'RE SEEKING $1.5 MILLION IN
EXCHANGE FOR 5% OF OUR COMPANY.
OOH.
WOW.
YOU'VE GOT SOME SALES,
I HOPE.
SINGTRIX IS THE MOST EXCITING
AND REVOLUTIONARY
SINGING EXPERIENCE
THAT'S EVER BEEN CREATED.
NOW EVERYBODY CAN SOUND LIKE
THEIR FAVORITE ROCK STARS
WITH NO EXPERIENCE
NECESSARY.
Berkowitz: IN ORDER TO PROVE
THE POWER OF SINGTRIX,
WE HAD TO FIND
A REALLY AWFUL SINGER.
SO MY PARTNER JOHN
IS GONNA BE SINGING FOR US.
[ Off-key ]
? LA ?
? LA-LA-LA ?
[ LAUGHTER ]
? LA-LA-LA ?
[ High-pitched, off-key ]
? LA-LA-LA ?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
ENOUGH.
THIS TIME, HE'S GONNA SING IT
THROUGH THE SINGTRIX UNIT.
IT'S GOING TO HELP HIM SING
IN TUNE,
IT'S GOING TO
PITCH-CORRECT HIM,
AND IT'S GONNA ADD
LIVE VOCAL HARMONIES.
[ UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS ]
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET YOU GUYS GOING.
LET'S GET SOME ENERGY.
NO CLAPPING?
IT'S JUST ME?
GO AHEAD.
WE'RE -- WE'RE
CONCENTRATING.
THERE WE GO.
[ In tune ]
? LA, LA-LA-LA ?
RIGHT HERE.
WOW.
Cuban: OH, MY --
WOW.
WOW!
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S CRAZY.
GO HIGH.
[ High-pitched, in tune ]
? LA-LA-LA ?
AMAZING.
NICE. NICE.
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
FOR YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW
IS WE'RE GONNA CYCLE THROUGH
SOME OF THE EFFECTS
THAT ARE IN
THE UNIT ITSELF.
[ Echoing ]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...
AMAZING.
Berkowitz: SO, THE UNIT HAS
OVER 350 DIFFERENT EFFECTS.
YOU CAN NOW HAVE
A MAN SING LIKE A WOMAN.
YOU COULD HAVE A WOMAN
SING LIKE A MAN.
YOU COULD SING
IN YOUR FAVORITE BARITONE VOICE.
IT'LL WORK
WITH ANY TYPE OF MUSIC.
SO, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
BACK IN THE '90s,
WE HAD A DRUMMING KARAOKE GAME
CALLED DRUMSCAPE.
I BUILT THE DRUMSCAPE IN
MY PARENTS' GARAGE WHEN I WAS 26
AND FILED ALL THE PATENTS,
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE
RELATED TO GUITAR HERO,
THE EARLIEST PATENTS.
FAST-FORWARD, WE WIND UP SELLING
OUR PATENTS TO ACTIVISION.
DID YOU DO WELL?
WE DID VERY WELL.
HOW MUCH IS THIS GONNA COST
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER?
RIGHT NOW, THE BUNDLE --
THE 40-WATT SPEAKER,
THE STAND, THE STUDIO,
AND THE MICROPHONE --
IS $345 AT RETAIL.
WE JUST CAME OUT SIX MONTHS AGO,
SO THIS WAS OUR PRIMARY SKU.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS?
$1.2 MILLION.
HOW MANY UNITS IS THAT?
Greiner:
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS?
WAIT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE CLEAR ON THIS.
4,000 UNITS.
Berkowitz: 4,000 UNITS.
ALL RIGHT. DOLLARS THAT IT COSTS
YOU TO MAKE THIS BUNDLE.
DOLLARS YOU SELL IT OUT TO
A WHOLESALER OR DISTRIBUTOR FOR.
$150 IS OUR LANDED COST.
WHOLESALE WOULD BE LIKE $265.
TELL ME WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
FROM HERE ON IN.
YOU'RE SAYING THE COMPANY'S
WORTH $30 MILLION.
IT'S NOT BASED
ON THE HISTORICAL SALES.
HERE'S -- HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.
WE HAVE A VERY LARGE
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS COMPANY
WHO WANTS TO TAKE OVER
OUR DISTRIBUTION
IN THE U.S. AND IN EUROPE.
SO, WE'RE EXPECTING TO SELL
30,000 UNITS THIS YEAR.
IS THIS AN EXCLUSIVE
THAT THEY HAVE?
IT WOULD BE AN EXCLUSIVE.
HERE'S WHERE IT'S EASY. IF WE
SELL 30,000 UNITS THIS YEAR,
WHICH IS NOT A LOT
DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON,
TIMES $250 TO $300,
YOU'RE AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
$6 MILLION TO $8 MILLION
AT A 40% MARGIN.
YEAH, BUT YOUR COST
IS GONNA RAMP UP, GUYS.
AS YOU GET TO THAT
$6 TO $8 MILLION,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE.
IT GETS MESSY. SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA USE THE MONEY FOR?
WELL, IF WE GO WITH
THIS DISTRIBUTION DEAL,
THAT MONEY'S GONNA BE USED
FOR MAKING NEW PRODUCTS.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
SOMEBODY WRITING A CHECK.
WE'VE HAD LOTS OF PEOPLE
OFFERING US MONEY
AT THE VALUATION THAT WE'VE
PUT OUT THERE, BUT FOR US --
AT $30 MILLION?
$30 MILLION?
AT $30 MILLION.
REALLY?
YES. WE'RE NOT
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
TO JUST WRITE US A CHECK,
SAY, "HERE'S THE MONEY, GO."
WE WANT TO GET INVOLVED
WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA
MAKE US BETTER.
Cuban: HERE'S WHAT I HEAR.
THERE'S A REASON
WHY YOU'RE LOOKING
TO DO A LICENSING DEAL
WITH THIS COMPANY.
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S GONNA TAKE
A BOATLOAD OF CASH
TO GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.
$1.5 MILLION ISN'T GOING TO DO
IT BECAUSE IT'S HEAVY INVENTORY.
THEN, ON TOP OF THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND
A BOATLOAD ON MARKETING
AND ADVERTISING, WHICH IS
ONE OF THE REASONS YOU'RE HERE.
FROM WHERE I SIT,
I DON'T SEE IT WORKING.
I'LL BE A CUSTOMER,
BUT I WON'T BE AN INVESTOR.
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
AND WE RESPECT THAT.
O'Leary:
LET ME THROW OUT AN OFFER HERE.
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.
I GIVE YOU $1.5 MILLION.
I START WITH 50%.
IF YOU GIVE ME BACK MY MILLION
AND A HALF WITHIN 18 MONTHS,
MY EQUITY DROPS DOWN TO 10%.
AT THE END OF IT,
IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,
AND YOU DO THESE DEALS AS YOU
SUGGEST -- 30,000 UNITS --
WE'RE LEFT WITH TWO THINGS.
I HAVE 10% AND A $2.50 ROYALTY
ON THIS DEVICE IN PERPETUITY.
BANG.
THERE IT IS.
LISTEN, I THINK
THAT'S A VERY FAIR OFFER,
BECAUSE EITHER YOU BELIEVE
IN YOUR FUTURE, OR YOU DON'T.
KEVIN, DOES THE ROYALTY
KICK IN
ONLY AFTER
YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK?
John: AFTER?
YES. IF YOU GUYS HAVE
A BETTER OFFER, LET'S HEAR IT.
Herjavec: I'M GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL MAKE IT
VERY SIMPLE AND VERY CLEAN.
I SEE THIS
AS A LONG-TERM PLAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU
$1.5 MILLION FOR 20%.
WOW, THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
[ WHISTLES ]
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
THANK YOU.
Greiner:
WELL, YOU GUYS ARE IMPRESSIVE,
AND I'D LIKE
TO BE INVOLVED HERE.
I LIKE
WHAT KEVIN OFFERED YOU.
WHAT?
I WOULD GO
$1.5 MILLION AT 30%.
YOU PAY ME BACK MY MONEY,
AND I'LL GO DOWN TO 15%.
AND THEN I ALSO
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE $2.50
THEREAFTER IN PERPETUITY
PER UNIT SOLD.
John:
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, LORI?
DID KEVIN BITE YOU
IN THE NECK LAST NIGHT?
I JUST LIKE KEVIN'S OFFER.
LIGHTNING STRUCK ME.
I THINK THIS STRUCTURE
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
I'D JOIN HER ON THAT DEAL.
WHAT'S REASONABLE FOR YOU
IN TERMS OF
HOW FAST YOU CAN PAY US BACK?
THAT WOULD BE
IF WE ACCEPTED THE OFFER.
YEAH. I MEAN, THE -- THE --
THE QUESTION IS --
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS
THE OFFER WORTH MONETARILY
THAT WE COULDN'T GET
OUTSIDE OF THIS TANK?
I'LL TELL YOU THE ANSWER.
"SHARK TANK," TWO SHARKS.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
Herjavec: WHEN YOU'RE GROWING
THIS QUICKLY,
THAT IS THE WORST TIME THAT YOU
WANT TO BE PAYING SOMEBODY BACK.
ROBERT'S DONE IT IN A WAY WHERE
IT COSTS YOU A LOT MORE EQUITY.
NO, I'VE DONE IT
OVER THE LONG-TERM.
NO, YOU'VE
COST THEM A FORTUNE.
I'VE DONE IT
OVER THE LONG-TERM.
WELL, WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW
IS --
John: WAIT A MINUTE.
I THINK I CAN HELP YOU
IN SOME AREAS.
I REPRESENT ULTRA MUSIC
FOR LICENSING,
AS WELL AS A LOT OF ARTISTS.
I'M UNDERWRITTEN BY SAMSUNG,
SO I CAN MAKE THE EQUIPMENT.
MY OFFER IS $1.5 MILLION
FOR 25%,
BUT I WILL FINANCE
ALL YOUR ORDERS GOING FORWARD.
THAT MEANS YOU WILL NOT NEED
ANY CAPITAL FOR ORDERS.
IF YOU COVET YOUR EQUITY,
WHICH I BELIEVE YOU DO,
YOU'LL LOOK AT OUR OFFER.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WELL, WE'RE WILLING
TO INCREASE OUR PERCENTAGE.
SO WE'LL OFFER $1.5 MILLION
FOR 7% IN THE COMPANY.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
John:
$1.5 MILLION FOR 7%?
YOU -- YOU CAME UP
A WHOLE 2%?
IN THIS WORLD, WHEN YOU'RE
DEALING WITH START-UPS,
WELL, I'M SORRY, GUYS.
NO, NO, NO.
Herjavec:
JOHN, I GOT TO TELL YOU --
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT PLANET YOU'RE ON,
BUT WE'RE HERE ON EARTH
IN THE SHARK TANK.
BUT HEAR THIS.
WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
WE MADE GUITAR HERO.
THAT WAS THE BIGGEST GAME EVER.
GUITAR HERO, THOUGH.
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
YEAH, THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
I'M OUT.
GUYS, I'M OUT.
Herjavec:
WE'RE SO FAR APART.
I'M OUT.
YOU ARE THE CLASSIC
"YOU'RE DEAD TO ME."
YOU GOT TO GO. I'M OUT.
SO, TURN AROUND, PLEASE.
Berkowitz: THE QUESTION IS,
WAS IT A MATTER OF EGO,
OR WAS IT A MATTER
OF DOLLAR AND CENTS?
MR. WONDERFUL
IS ALWAYS SAYING,
"I'M HERE FOR THE MONEY,
FOR THE MONEY, FOR THE MONEY."
"NOT FOR THE PERCENT."
THIS WAS A MONEY DEAL.
THERE WAS MONEY THERE.
BIG MONEY.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A PRODUCT DESIGNED TO GIVE
KIDS A SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
John: ALL RIGHT, BYE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
Cuban:
GOOD JOB, TEGAN.
Herjavec:
BYE, TEGAN.
DON'T YOU NEED MULTIPLE SIZES?
BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE
THE FLEXIBILITY
OF THE ONE INCH OF VELCRO
IN TERMS OF EXPANDABILITY.
WE DO, BUT WE'VE BEEN
IN BUSINESS FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
AND WE'VE PROVEN
THAT PEOPLE ARE EAGER
TO BUY THE NEXT SIZE UP
WHEN THEIR CHILD OUTGROWS.
MY CONCERN IS THAT IT FORCES YOU
TO CARRY MUCH MORE INVENTORY...
IT -- IT DOES.
...BECAUSE YOU NEED
SO MANY SIZES.
IT'S TRUE.
THIS IS TYPICAL KEVIN.
HE WANTS TO LOOK
FOR ALL THE NEGATIVE
IN THE PRODUCT RIGHT AWAY.
TELL US THE POSITIVE.
TELL US HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN
IN BUSINESS. TELL US YOUR SALES.
SURE. SO, WE LAUNCHED
ALMOST 10 YEARS AGO.
IN SEPTEMBER,
IT'S OUR 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.
CONGRATS.
AS I SAID -- THANK YOU.
THE LAST YEAR,
OUR SALES WERE $205,000.
WHAT WERE THEY
THE YEAR BEFORE?
UM, $220,000.
OOH.
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE YEAR BEFORE?
THE LAST THREE YEARS,
WE'VE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE
BECAUSE WE'RE SOLD ONLINE
AND ALSO MAINLY
INDEPENDENT BOUTIQUES.
AND WHEN THE RECESSION HIT,
WE FOUND A LOT OF OUR BOUTIQUES
WERE STRUGGLING.
THEY REALLY WERE BEING
MORE CONSERVATIVE.
EVEN A BIG CATALOG WE WERE IN
WENT BANKRUPT.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
WASTING MY MONEY
AND SPINNING MY WHEELS,
KNOCKING ON PEOPLE'S DOORS
WHO DID NOT WANT
TO TAKE ANYONE'S CALL.
AND SO WE DECIDED
TO KIND OF PUT A PAUSE
AND TO FOCUS ONLINE
AND TO WEATHER OUT THE STORM --
BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME
THE ECONOMY
FOR THREE YEARS
OF DECLINING SALES.
YOU CAN'T.
John: WHAT PRICE
DO YOU MAKE THEM AT?
CANVAS IS $2.20.
THE LEATHER'S $3.50.
OKAY. AND THEN YOU SELL THEM
FOR HOW MUCH?
WHOLESALE, $8.45,
AND $9.45 FOR THE LEATHER.
WHAT ABOUT
BIG-BOX RETAILERS?
WE WERE ON
A PRETTY HIGH TRAJECTORY,
AND THEN WE
KIND OF LEVELED OUT.
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE BIG-BOX
STORES, THEY BECAME VERY NARROW.
BUT I FEEL LIKE NOW,
THE WHOLESALE STORES ARE BEING
MORE OPEN-MINDED AGAIN,
AND I FEEL LIKE
WE ARE ON A TRAJECTORY --
MY CONCERN IS,
OVER 10 YEARS,
TO TOP OUT AT $200,000
ON AN ITEM
AS BASIC AS A BELT --
THAT'S DECLINING.
IT REALLY IS --
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
IT'S DECLINING.
TO BE HONEST,
THE FIRST FIVE YEARS,
I WAS BALANCING MOTHERHOOD.
I HAD THREE LITTLE KIDS.
I'M GONNA GUESS
THE SIZE OF THE MARKET
IS AROUND $100 MILLION
A YEAR.
WHY DO WE HAVE
SO LITTLE OF IT?
WHAT IS HOLDING YOU BACK?
I THINK I'VE BEEN --
I'VE BEEN LEARNING,
AND I THINK I'VE LEARNED A TON
ABOUT MY MARKET.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE ECONOMIC
CLIMATE IMPACTED GROWTH,
BUT I'VE BEEN SPENDING THAT TIME
THINKING BIGGER.
I SHOULDN'T BE
POUNDING THE DOORS
OF INDEPENDENT,
SMALL BOUTIQUES.
I SHOULD BE THINKING
ABOUT LICENSING MY CLOSURE
TO LANDS' END, IZOD, THE GAP.
HAVE YOU REACHED OUT
TO THEM?
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I'M HERE
IS TO HAVE
A STRATEGIC PARTNER.
I THINK SOMEONE LIKE YOU
CAN COME IN
AND REALLY HELP
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.
WE HAVE
INTERNATIONAL PATENTS --
LOOK, YOU NEED
A STRATEGIC PARTNER.
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY
TO DO THE THINGS THAT,
IN REALITY...
NOT TO --
...YOU NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT
OVER FIVE YEARS.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
A ONE-YEAR START-UP HERE.
BUT I KNOW --
I KNOW THE PATH.
I JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP
OPENING THOSE DOORS.
O'Leary:
YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF ISSUES.
THE MARKET'S TELLING ME
THIS IS NOT WORKING.
I'M SORRY.
$200,000 IN SALES
IS NOT A LOT IN A MARKET THAT'S
MUCH LARGER THAN THIS, OKAY?
IT IS.
IT IS MUCH LARGER.
AND, SO, THE MARKET
HAS SPOKEN TO ME,
AND IT'S SAID, "NOT WORTH
DOING A DEAL HERE." I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
DON'T THANK ME.
GO FIX IT.
NO, THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.
I WOULD LOVE TO FIX IT.
I KNOW I'M AT THE POINT
WHERE I NEED A PARTNER.
John:
YEAH. WELL, THAT'S WHY --
THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT US,
YOU KNOW?
I'M GONNA TAKE A RISK ON YOU.
OH, DAYMOND, THANK YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU $75,000
FOR 25%.
I'M SO GRATEFUL.
I'M SO EXCITED THAT YOU DON'T
HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
UM, COULD I COUNTER
AND SAY 20%?
[ Sighing ] OHH!
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, GOLLY!
WELL, OUR SALES ARE $200,000.
WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL PATENTS
WITH ONE OF YOUR BELTS,
BUT THE VELCRO WON'T HOLD.
John: NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WANT
MY PARTNER TO DO --
NOT ACCEPT ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T GET
UNLESS YOU ASK.
NOW, OF COURSE, NO,
ON THE COUNTER, BUT...
[ LAUGHTER ]
...I DO LIKE THAT.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
$75,000 FOR 25%.
THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
OKAY. I ACCEPT.
OH, COOL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOT TO GET A LITTLE EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.
THEY JUST BEAT YOU UP.
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
Cuban: CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
GOOD JOB, DAYMOND.
YOU GUYS BEAT THAT GIRL UP
FOR NO REASON.
