MY NAME IS ASHLEY DRAKE, AND
I'M FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.
I'M AN ACTIVE-DUTY OFFICER
IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY.
CURRENTLY, I'M A CAPTAIN WITH
THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS.
IN 2007,
WE WERE DEPLOYED TO IRAQ.
I DID 15 MONTHS OVERSEAS.
IT WAS A VERY REWARDING
EXPERIENCE
BEING AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR,
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING MISSIONS.
Drake: 100.
AS USUAL.
[ LAUGHS ]
THIS COMPANY IS GROWING FASTER
THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD,
AND WE CANNOT KEEP UP
WITH THE DEMAND.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ASHLEY DRAKE,
AND YOU -- ALL OF YOU --
NEED TO GET A GRIP...
...THE NATURAL GRIP.
I'M SEEKING A $100,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
DO YOU WANT YOUR HANDS
TO LOOK LIKE THIS
WHEN YOU GET DONE WORKING OUT?
NO!
NOBODY DOES.
AND MY PRODUCT
PREVENTS THIS PROBLEM.
YES, THERE ARE OTHER
HAND-PROTECTION DEVICES
ON THE MARKET.
THEY'RE LEATHER, THEY'RE CLOTH,
THEY'RE NYLON,
AND THEY DON'T WORK.
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THEY SLIP OFF
YOUR HANDS, THEY'RE BULKY,
AND THEY HINDER YOUR PERFORMANCE
IN THE GYM.
NOT THE NATURAL GRIP.
WE ARE THE ONLY CUSTOM
HAND GRIP ON THE MARKET.
OUR GRIP IS BASED OFF
OF YOUR RING-FINGER SIZE.
AND WE ARE THE ONLY
REUSABLE TAPE GRIP.
SO LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.
ONE OF OUR SPONSORED ATHLETES,
DANIELLE SIDELL,
WILL NOW PERFORM
THE CLEAN AND JERK.
SHE HAS JUST 165 POUNDS
ON THE BAR, NO BIG DEAL.
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
TO WEAR GRIPS DURING THIS
BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE
THEY CANNOT HAVE PROPER CONTROL
OF THE BAR
AND GET IT OVER THE HEAD SAFELY.
Man: WOW.
DANIELLE DOESN'T HAVE
THAT PROBLEM.
Greiner: WOW.
THERE YOU GO.
GOOD JOB, DANIELLE.
IMPRESSIVE.
SO NOW SHE'S GOING TO DO
SOME BAR MUSCLE-UPS.
NOW, BAR MUSCLE-UPS ARE
A VERY COMPLEX MOVEMENT.
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEIR HANDS
START TO RIP AND TEAR OPEN
SO THEY HAVE TO DROP
FROM THE BAR.
NOT DANIELLE.
IN FACT, SHE'S ABLE TO GO
FROM THE BAR MUSCLE-UP
STRAIGHT INTO KIPPING PULL-UPS
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
THAT IS NOT TYPICAL.
YEAH, YOU THINK?
WHY? BECAUSE HER --
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, BECAUSE OF HER HANDS.
THAT'S WHY.
BECAUSE THEY'RE PROTECTED,
AND SHE FEELS SAFE ON THE BAR.
SO I HAVE SOME CUSTOM GRIPS
FOR YOU.
ARE YOU SAYING
IF KEVIN PUT THAT ON,
HE COULD DO
EVERYTHING SHE DID?
I MEAN, I'M NOT GUARA--
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO?
GO BEAT HIM UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ROBERT, YOU HAVE THE CUSTOM
DANIELLE SIDELL NATURAL GRIP.
YEAH.
Herjavec: ASHLEY, HOW
DO YOU PUT THEM ON?
YOU JUST PUT THEM OVER YOUR RING
FINGER AND YOUR MIDDLE FINGER.
AND THEN
HOW DOES IT ATTACH?
IS THERE A STRAP
THAT GOES --
WELL, YOU CAN ATTACH IT WITH OUR
CUSTOM NATURAL GRIP GOAT TAPE,
WHICH WE'LL SELL YOU
FOR $7 A ROLL.
I LIKE THE UP-SELL.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
OR YOU CAN -- YOU CAN ATTACH IT
WITH YOUR OWN WRIST WRAPS.
SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS,
I WANT YOU TO PUT GIVE
IN THE GRIP.
SO YOU SEE HOW YOU KIND OF ARC
YOUR HARD LIKE THAT RIGHT THERE.
OKAY.
FEELS REALLY GOOD.
MM-HMM.
IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE.
ARE YOU COMING UP HERE
WITH ME?
YEAH, I'LL COME UP.
I'LL TRY IT.
I SEE A HERNIA.
EASY.
THERE YOU GO, ROBERT.
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.
YOU DID BETTER THAN I DO.
Drake: GOOD JOB.
[ APPLAUSE ]
O'Leary: THERE YOU GO.
HOW DO YOUR HANDS FEEL?
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
THE GRIPS ARE AMAZING.
HE CAN GO ALL DAY.
Drake: THAT'S WHY SALES
ARE SO GOOD.
Cuban:
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
GOOD JOB.
John: GOOD JOB, ROB.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, SHARKS, YOU CAN RIP,
YOU CAN TEAR,
YOU CAN BLEED
ALL OVER THE PLACE,
OR YOU CAN GET THE NATURAL GRIP.
SO WHO'S READY TO STOP THE PAIN
AND SEE THE GAINS?
WHAT ARE YOUR QUESTIONS?
O'Leary: WELL, QUESTIONS
ARE ABOUT MONEY.
SO, YOU PUT A VALUE ON THIS
FOR $500,000.
THAT MEANS YOU MUST HAVE
SOME SALES OR YOU'RE CRAZY.
WHICH ONE IS IT?
I HAVE SALES.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, THE NATURAL GRIP'S ONLY BEEN
IN EXISTENCE FOR A YEAR NOW,
AND WE HAVE $178,000 IN SALES.
GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT'S GOOD.
WHAT WAS YOUR
FULL-TIME JOB?
WHAT DID YOU DO
BEFORE YOU DID THIS?
OKAY, SO, MY FULL-TIME JOB
IS I'M ACTIVE-DUTY ARMY.
WOW.
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET HERE?
John: YEAH.
WHAT -- WHY THIS?
WHY DID YOU CREATE IT?
I STARTED CrossFit IN 2012,
AND I STARTED RIPPING MY HANDS,
AND I WAS SO DEVASTATED,
BECAUSE WHEN YOU RIP YOUR HANDS,
YOU'RE OUT OF THE GYM
FOR AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS
WHILE YOU HEAL.
SO I TRIED TO FIND SOMETHING
TO FIX THE PROBLEM,
AND NONE OF IT WAS WORKING.
MY HUSBAND GOT SICK
OF HEARING ME COMPLAIN ABOUT IT,
AND HE SAID, "I THINK
I CAN MAKE YOU SOMETHING
THAT'LL FIX THIS PROBLEM."
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IT THEN,
BUT THE NATURAL GRIP WAS BORN.
I'M CURIOUS. WHY DON'T
THE OTHER PRODUCTS WORK?
'CAUSE THERE ARE A LOT
OF OTHER PRODUCTS.
SO THE OTHER GRIPS ARE LEATHER,
SO THEY'RE BULKY.
THEY'RE NYLON OR CLOTH,
SO THEY'RE SLICK.
SO WHAT'S PROPRIETARY
ABOUT YOURS IS THE MATERIAL.
NO. WHAT'S PROPRIETARY
ABOUT MINE,
AND WHAT I HAVE
A PATENT PENDING ON,
IS THE METHOD
OF A REUSABLE TAPE GRIP
BASED OFF OF RING-FINGER SIZE.
WHAT -- WHAT MATERIAL
IS THIS?
THAT IS 100% COTTON
ADHESIVE MATERIAL.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU SELLING
THESE UNITS FOR?
SO, RIGHT NOW
WE'RE ON A DISTRIBUTOR MODEL.
WE SELL TO DISTRIBUTORS
FOR $10 A UNIT,
AND THEN THEY RESELL IT
FOR $17 A UNIT.
HOW MANY UNITS
HAVE YOU SOLD NOW?
I'VE SOLD 13,000 UNITS.
WHAT DOES IT COST
FOR EACH PACKAGE?
SO, EACH UNIT COSTS ME
$4.43 TO MAKE.
$4 OF THE $4.43 IS LABOR.
ARE YOU MAKING THEM?
LIKE --
I FOUND SUBCONTRACTORS --
STAY-AT-HOME MOM,
HIGH-SCHOOL KIDS, RETIREES,
PEOPLE THAT NEEDED WORK.
AND I SAID, "I WILL TRAIN YOU.
TAKE MY MATERIAL.
AND I WILL PAY YOU BY THE PIECE
WHEN YOU DROP OFF."
I OWN THE NUMBER-ONE CrossFit
IN THE WORLD,
WHICH IS ON FIFTH AVE.
IS YOUR MARKET PURELY
JUST CrossFitters?
IS THERE A MARKET
OUTSIDE OF CrossFit?
ABSOLUTELY. WHY?
POWER LIFTERS, OLYMPIC LIFTERS.
I HAVE MOTORCROSS GUYS
THAT ARE BUYING THIS PRODUCT.
YEAH, I COULD SEE THAT.
Greiner: I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING,
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.
YOU CAME IN,
YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF,
YOU HAVE A GREAT
ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT.
FOR ME, THOUGH,
I HAVE TO BE PASSIONATE
ABOUT EVERYTHING I INVEST IN,
Herjavec: SO,
ASHLEY, YOUR PROBLEM IS
YOU NEED THE MONEY TO BUILD
INVENTORY TO FILL DEMAND.
TO MANUFACTURE THIS
MORE EFFICIENTLY AND TO --
TO GET MORE OF THEM
TO BUILD INVENTORY
SO WHEN I GET THE ORDERS FROM
MY DISTRIBUTORS FOR THOUSANDS,
I CAN FILL IT.
RIGHT NOW, THEY WAIT.
WHAT'S THE TURN-- WHAT'S
THE TURN-AROUND TIME NOW?
WITH THE CURRENT 6-MAN STAFF,
I CAN DO 3,000 UNITS A MONTH.
WOW. THAT'S A MAJOR CONSTRAINT
TO YOUR BUSINESS.
I ADMIT YOU HAVE SALES.
SOMETHING'S WORKING.
BUT FOR ME,
I CAN'T GET EXCITED ABOUT IT
BECAUSE OF HOW VERTICAL NICHE-Y
IT IS. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
ASHLEY, TWO YEARS FROM NOW,
THREE YEARS FROM NOW,
HOW BIG IS THIS,
WHAT ARE THE SALES,
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
OKAY, ASHLEY.
SO, WE ALL KNOW
I'M THE SPORTY SHARK.
YOU HAVE
TREMENDOUS CREDIBILITY,
AND YOU'RE A GREAT OPERATOR.
EVERY BUSINESS I'VE INVESTED IN
ON "SHARK TANK"
THAT HAD A GREAT OPERATOR
HAS SUCCEEDED.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 30%.
HEY, THERE!
AND I AM WITH YOU 100%
ON THE STRATEGY.
Greiner: HOO-HA.
HOO-RAH.
LET'S GO.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I GOT IT.
I THINK YOU --
I THINK YOU NEED MORE
THAN JUST THE MONEY.
I KNOW ROBERT HAS
A COUPLE CONNECTIONS,
BUT OBVIOUSLY
I'M IN THIS SPACE.
SO I'M WILLING TO GO
IN $100,000 FOR...40%.
OOH.
AND I'M A PARTNER
WITH THE ONLY PERSON
THAT CAN PUT "REEBOK"
ON THE BOXES.
IT'S NOT A REEBOK SALE.
I MEAN,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY
IS WHAT YOU NEED
TO KEEP DOING.
AND I'M -- I'M VERY THANKFUL
FOR BOTH OF THOSE OFFERS.
I HAVE A MANUFACTURING ISSUE.
I DON'T NEED MORE FANCY PEOPLE
WEARING MY GRIPS
'CAUSE I CAN'T MAKE THEM
FAST ENOUGH
TO SELL TO THE STAY-AT-HOME MOM
RIGHT NOW.
I'VE BEEN MANUFACTURING
SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN.
I ACTUALLY TOOK MY UMBILICAL
CORD AND MADE IT INTO A BELT.
OKAY.
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
Greiner: UNH-UNH.
I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THE MANUFACTURING.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'M GONNA SWEETEN MY OFFER.
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA
GIVE YOU MORE.
$125,000 FOR 25%.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000
FOR 33%.
I KNOW THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.
I KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
AND I KNOW
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
FOR THE MANUFACTURING SIDE
BEFORE WE GO ANYPLACE ELSE.
AND I'M DYING OF OLD AGE.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.
WHAT DO YOU FEEL
IN YOUR GUT?
UM, I FEEL IN MY GUT
THAT DAYMOND,
YOU'RE VERY WELL-CONNECTED
AND YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY,
BUT I'VE BEEN LIVING
THE GRIND FOR A YEAR,
AND HARD WORK, ENERGY,
AND EFFORT --
I ONLY GET LESS THAN FOUR HOURS
OF SLEEP, HONESTLY.
AND I FEEL LIKE ROBERT
CAN HELP ME GET THERE,
AND I WANT TO DO A DEAL
WITH YOU.
LET'S DO IT.
Cuban: CONGRATULATIONS.
O'Leary: OH.
Greiner: CONGRATULATIONS,
DANIELLE.
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
THAT IS A BIG MISTAKE.
Greiner: CONGRATS.
THANK YOU.
[ GIGGLES ]
LOVE IT.
YOU KNOW,
IF THAT DIDN'T WORK,
I WAS GONNA CHALLENGE YOU
TO A CHIN-UP CONTEST,
AND THEN JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT.
SHE JUST PARTNERED UP
WITH A CYBER-THEFT GUY.
[ LAUGHS ]
NO, NO.
SHE PARTNERED UP
WITH A SPORTY SHARK.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
[ LAUGHS ]
Drake: THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR
MY HUSBAND AND OUR 3-YEAR-OLD,
IT'S GONNA BE LIFE-CHANGING,
YOU KNOW?
IT'S JUST --
I'M JUST SO THANKFUL FOR IT.
AND, LIKE, HARD WORK,
IT PAYS OFF.
[ WOMAN SHOUTS ]
[ ALL SHOUT ]
WE'RE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY.
YES, "SHARK TANK"
IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
John: HERE THEY COME.
PAIGE, ASHLEY, ROB,
WELCOME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
WELCOME!
ALSO JOINING US TODAY
ARE ACTIVE-DUTY
AND VETERAN ENTREPRENEURS
WHO MADE DEALS WITH US
ON "SHARK TANK."
THIS IS BIG TIME
FOR ALL OF US.
WE'RE AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY
BECAUSE "SHARK TANK"
HAS BEEN INVITED
TO PARTICIPATE
IN A CHAMPIONS
OF CHANGE EVENT
THAT CELEBRATES
VETERAN ENTREPRENEURS.
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.
WHY DON'T WE GO CHECK IT OUT,
ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO DO IT.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
VALERIE JARRETT.
[ APPLAUSE ]
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID
AGAIN AND AGAIN,
"WE MUST SUPPORT OUR VETERANS
"AS THEY TRANSITION
FROM PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY
TO LEADING OUR COUNTRY
IN SO MANY WAYS."
O'Leary: WE'RE HERE TO HONOR
VETERAN ENTREPRENEURS
AND ALSO PROVIDE
OUR OWN ADVICE
TO THOSE THAT ASPIRE
TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS.
O'Leary: MANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES
THAT YOU'RE TRAINED AT
ARE VERY USEFUL IN BUSINESS.
LEADERSHIP IS ONE OF OUR BEST
TRAITS THAT WE BRING AS VETS.
I LOOK FOR DESIRE, DRIVE, HONOR,
AND THE ABILITY
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.
FOR US, IT WAS
ALL ABOUT JUST FINDING
WHAT WE WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT
AND RUNNING WITH IT.
DON'T START A BUSINESS.
FIND A PROBLEM,
SOLVE A PROBLEM.
THE BUSINESS COMES SECOND.
THESE VETS ALREADY
HAVE THE TOOLS
AND THE DETERMINATION
TO SUCCEED.
ALL THEY NEED
IS A LITTLE GUIDANCE,
BUT THEY KNOW HOW TO WIN.
AS THESE GUYS COME BACK
FROM THE BATTLEFIELDS,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW THEM
THAT THEIR UNIQUE SKILL SET
CAN BE APPLIED
TO STARTING THEIR OWN BUSINESS.
SOMETIMES, THEY JUST NEED
TO BE SHOWN THE PATH.
Man: ONE MORE ROUND OF APPLAUSE
FOR THIS TEAM UP HERE.
[ APPLAUSE ]
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
O'Leary: THIS IS THE EPICENTER
OF FREEDOM IN THE WORLD,
OF CAPITALISM,
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
WITH "SHARK TANK"
AND THE WHITE HOUSE
WORKING TOGETHER,
WE CAN INSPIRE
A WHOLE NEW GENERATION
OF ENTREPRENEURS TO MAKE
OUR ECONOMY GROW EVEN FASTER.
OUR VETERANS ARE SOME
OF THE MOST TALENTED
AND CREATIVE LEADERS
IN OUR COUNTRY,
AND IT'S NO SURPRISE
THAT MANY OF THEM
GO ON TO LEAD BUSINESSES
OF THEIR OWN
WHEN THEIR SERVICE ENDS.
SO MY HUSBAND AND I
ARE THRILLED TO CELEBRATE
VETERANS SMALL BUSINESS WEEK
WITH ALL OF YOU AT "SHARK TANK."
NOW, THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY,
WE'RE CONNECTING VETERANS
WITH WORKSHOPS, RESOURCES,
AND TRAINING PROGRAMS
TO HELP THEM LAUNCH
AND GROW THEIR BUSINESSES
BECAUSE WE KNOW
THAT JOINING FORCES
WITH VETERAN ENTREPRENEURS
ISN'T JUST GOOD
FOR THEIR BOTTOM LINE,
IT'S GOOD
FOR OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY.
SO TO ALL OF OUR VETERANS
ON "SHARK TANK"
AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
WE WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A BUSINESS
UTILIZING MAN'S BEST FRIEND.
HI, SHARKS.
