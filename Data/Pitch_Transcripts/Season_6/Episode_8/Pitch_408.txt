AND I REALLY BELIEVE
THAT WE MADE A DIFFERENCE.
Man: LET'S GO!
FOR ME, PHYSICAL FITNESS
IS VERY IMPORTANT
NOT ONLY FOR MY CAREER
IN THE MILITARY,
BUT ALSO JUST TO STAY HEALTHY
AND THE BEST THAT I CAN BE
FOR MY FAMILY.
I WAS DOING A LOT OF TRAINING
TO STAY IN SHAPE.
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.
WHEN YOU DO
HIGH-INTENSITY WORKOUTS,
YOU NEED THE RIGHT GEAR TO
PROTECT YOU AND PREVENT INJURY.
Man: HOW MANY ORDERS
DO WE HAVE TO DO TONIGHT?
WE BELIEVE IN THIS SO MUCH
THAT MY HUSBAND
LEFT HIS FULL-TIME JOB
SO THAT HE COULD TAKE ON
THE COMPANY FULL TIME.
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH!
WE NEED TO FORM A STRATEGIC
PARTNERSHIP WITH A SHARK.
I KNOW THAT APPLYING THE YEARS
OF DEDICATION AND DETERMINATION
THAT I'VE LEARNED IN THE SERVICE
CAN REALLY MAKE THIS DREAM
A REALITY.
AND I'M NOT FEELING THE PASSION
ON THIS ONE.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I -- I BELIEVE
IF WE CAN KEEP UP WITH DEMAND,
WE WILL GROSS $400,000
IN -- IN SALES THIS YEAR.
BUT IN 2015, IF WE CAN KEEP UP
WITH THE DEMAND,
WE WILL -- WE WILL HIT
$1 MILLION IN SALES.
WHY? BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY
I'M TARGETING TO RIGHT NOW
IS GROWING.
I HAVE A PRODUCT THAT WEARS OUT
THAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT AGAIN,
THEN I CAN EXPAND
OUTSIDE OF CrossFit.
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO EXPAND OUTSIDE OF CrossFit.
THAT'S NOT
THE OPPORTUNITY.
THE OPPORTUNITY IS ADDING
ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS
THAT LEVERAGE
YOUR CREDIBILITY
AND THE TRUST THAT
YOU'VE DEVELOPED.
HE'S SO WRONG.
I-I'M RIGHT.
TRUST ME.
I BUILT IT FOR THE CrossFit
COMMUNITY, BUT THE FACT
THAT IT COULD HELP OTHER PEOPLE
OUT THERE, I'M OPEN TO THAT.
I'M SOLVING A PROBLEM,
SO IF SOMEONE ELSE
IS RIPPING THEIR HANDS,
LET'S SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, LET'S DEAL --
HOO-RAH!
LET'S DEAL WITH THIS --
RIGHT.
THIS THAT WE HAVE GOING ON.
YOU ARE ONE
MOTIVATED COWBOY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE NOT WASTING YOUR TIME
IN "SHARK TANK,"
I MUST SAY THAT.
I MEAN, THE FACT THAT
I WAS ABLE TO GET HERE
IN THIS SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
ALL RIGHT, SOMEBODY GIVE
THIS WOMAN $100,000
AND GET HER OUT OF HERE.
YEAH.
WHO'S IN AGAIN?
ME, YOU, AND ROBERT.
I'M NOT GONNA FALL
FOR YOUR CRAP THIS TIME.
Herjavec: YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DO THIS EVERY TIME.
I GET IMPATIENT,
AND THEN CUBAN COMES IN
IN THE 11th HOUR,
SO I'M JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND WAIT.
O'Leary:
WHY DON'T YOU DECLARE, MARK?
SHOWDOWN AT O.K. CORRAL.
Narrator:
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT,
AND IT SEEMS MARK, DAYMOND,
AND ROBERT ARE AT A STANDOFF.
ROBERT,
YOU GONNA MAKE AN OFFER?
JUST --
JUST THINKING.
WHAT'S MARK'S FAMOUS LINE?
"I'M JUST THINKING."
WELL, MAKE AN OFFER.
I'M DYING OF OLD AGE.
Cuban: I DON'T CARE
WHAT THESE GUYS DO.
BUT I LIKE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU DESERVE SO MUCH CREDIT.
I SEE THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP UP.
THAT'S FINE.
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T SEE WAS
WHAT'S NEXT, RIGHT?
WHAT I WAS HOPING
TO HEAR WAS,
"AFTER THIS PRODUCT,
THEN THERE'S THE TAPE.
"AFTER THE TAPE, THERE'S THIS,
THEN THAT AND THIS
SO THAT WE CAN GROW IT
INTO SOMETHING ENORMOUS."
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
AND BECOME A PART
OF THE MOST ELITE
CANINE SECURITY COMPANY
IN THE COUNTRY?
[ DOG GROWLS ]
OH, MY GOD.
WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVE
IS THE ULTIMATE MANLY GIFT.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ELI CRANE.
I'M HIS WIFE, JEN.
OUR BUSINESS
IS BOTTLE BREACHER.
WE ARE SEEKING $150,000
FOR 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR BUSINESS.
AT BOTTLE BREACHER, WE MAKE
THE FINEST PERSONALIZED
.50-CALIBER BOTTLE OPENERS
ON THE MARKET.
YOU MIGHT BE ASKING YOURSELF,
"WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT
A .50-CALIBER BOTTLE OPENER?"
SHORT ANSWER IS,
"THEY'RE AWESOME."
[ LAUGHS ]
AS A FORMER NAVY S.E.A.L.,
I KNEW I NEEDED
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY
WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE NAVY.
BOTTLE BREACHER HAS GIVEN US
THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.
AND IT'S ACTUALLY
REALLY SIMPLE.
MOST GUYS
LIKE DRINKING BEER.
MOST GUYS THINK
THAT LARGE-CALIBER BULLETS
ARE VERY COOL.
AT BOTTLE BREACHER,
WE'VE COMBINED THE TWO
TO CREATE
THE ULTIMATE MANLY GIFT.
WE'VE MANAGED TO CREATE
A SUCCESSFUL COMPANY,
BUT WE KNOW,
WITH YOUR HELP,
WE CAN BREACH THIS THING
WIDE OPENED.
[ HERJAVEC CHUCKLES ]
WE MADE
EACH ONE OF YOU GUYS
A PERSONALIZED .50-CALIBER
BEER-BOTTLE OPENER.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
WE BROUGHT YOU GUYS
SOME BEER.
MR. CUBAN, WE FOUND SOME
GLUTEN-FREE BEER FOR YOU.
I'LL TAKE IT.
Jen:
ROBERT, WE HAVE A RACECAR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I LIKE THAT.
Jen: YES.
IT'S GREAT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ELI.
CHEERS.
Cuban: CHEERS.
CHEERS, GUYS.
O'Leary: SO, ELI,
IS IT A REAL .50 CAL?
MR. WONDERFUL,
THAT IS A DUMMY ROUND.
WE USE RECYCLED BULLETS.
WE ARE BUYING
THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE,
SO THAT'S ONE PLACE WE KNOW,
IN THE FUTURE,
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY
SLASH OUR COSTS
BY GOING DIRECTLY
TO THE MANUFACTURER.
WHERE DO YOU SELL IT?
Jen: WELL,
WE SELL THEM ONLINE.
WE HAVE A ETSY STORE, AND
THEN WE HAVE OUR OWN WEBSITE.
ON AVERAGE,
THEY ARE $23.50.
OKAY.
THEY HAVE
A PRETTY WIDE RANGE.
WE HAVE A LOT OF ADD-ONS,
SO WE CAN ALWAYS ADD-ON
TO THE CUSTOMER.
WHAT ARE THE ADD-ONS?
A ROUND IN, LIKE, BRASS
WOULD START AT $20.
YOU CAN ADD ON ENGRAVING
FOR $5.
YOU CAN ADD A BOX FOR $5.
YOU CAN DO DOUBLE-SIDE
ENGRAVINGS,
WHICH IS AN EXTRA $4.
WHAT'S THE PRICE
YOU'RE PAYING FOR EACH ON?
THE COST TO US,
AFTER LABOR, IS $9.03.
MM-HMM. YES.
SO, UM --
O'Leary: BUT YOU'RE NOT SELLING
TO RETAIL, RIGHT?
NOT -- NOT AT THIS POINT,
SIR.
NOT AT THIS POINT.
WE ARE IN TWO STRATEGIC
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES.
OKAY, SO, YOU'RE SELLING THEM
NOW AT WHAT?
WE USUALLY SELL THEM
BETWEEN $16 TO $18.
OUR BIGGEST MARKET
IS WEDDINGS.
WEDDINGS?
WEDDINGS?
IT IS A GROOMSMAN GIFT.
FATHER OF THE BRIDE,
USHERS, GROOMSMEN, BEST MAN --
THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
ANYONE WE CAN GET
IN THE WEDDINGS
BECAUSE THEY'RE WILLING
TO PAY MORE MONEY.
YOU SAID YOU CREATED SOMETHING
FROM SCRATCH.
IT'S A REAL BUSINESS NOW.
GIVE IT TO US
IN TERMS OF NUMBERS.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
YEAR TO DATE, WE'VE MADE
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
WOW.
AND --
ALL ONLINE,
OR THROUGH RETAIL, OR HOW?
ALL ONLINE.
AND WE'RE PROJECTED
TO END AT $840,000.
WE JUST STARTED JANUARY
OF LAST YEAR.
THAT FIRST MONTH,
WE ONLY MADE $375,
AND LAST MONTH WAS OUR BIGGEST
MONTH EVER AT $100,000.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
THAT'S AWESOME.
ANSWER WHY IT'S CALLED
"BOTTLE BREACHER."
Eli: YES, SIR.
I'D LOVE TO ANSWER.
A BREACHER IS AN OPERATOR
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO GET US --
THE ASSAULTERS INTO WHATEVER
TARGET WE'RE HITTING.
Cuban:
GOES IN FIRST, RIGHT?
SO YOU GOT THAT BIG OLD DOOR --
YES, SIR.
WHETHER IT'S A SLEDGEHAMMER,
WHETHER IT'S A STRIP-CHARGE
EXPLOSIVE ON THE DOOR,
HE IS THE BREACHER.
THAT'S A QUALIFICATION
LIKE "SNIPER."
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO BREACH
INTO THAT BEER SOMEHOW, RIGHT?
YOU GOT TO GET IN THERE.
YOU GOT TO BREACH.
BOTTLE BREACHER.
AND OUR CUSTOMER BASE,
WE FOUND, LOVES IT.
Herjavec:
THAT'S A GREAT STORY.
THEY LOVE IT.
Greiner: CAN THIS BE MADE
IN OTHER BULLETS?
YEAH.
YES, MA'AM.
THAT'S
A 20-MILLIMETER ROUND.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD FIRE OUT
OF, LIKE, AN ATTACK HELICOPTER
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
SO...
SO THIS IS LIKE --
Herjavec: OH!
OH, MY GOSH.
Cuban: OH, YEAH.
THIS IS THE MOTHER
OF ALL BULLETS.
John: OH, YEAH.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
COMPARE.
WE ACTUALLY CALL THAT
THE WMD --
THE WEAPON
OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
YOU GET ANY RESISTANCE
BECAUSE IT'S A BULLET?
BECAUSE SOME MERCHANDISERS
DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT
OF A BULLET BECAUSE
THERE'S BEEN, IN OUR SOCIETY...
NO.
...PROBLEMS AND ISSUES
WITH BULLETS AND GUNS.
NO.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW,
TO THAT POINT, WE --
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS
SO FAR, YOU KNOW,
PUSHING THESE ALONG
THROUGH THE MARKET.
AND WE FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, THEY SEE IT
AS A DISPLAY PIECE
AND NOTHING --
NOTHING REALLY HARMFUL.
Jen: THAT'S WHERE THE STORE'S
COMING FROM.
AFTER THE EPISODE,
I LOOKED AT JEN,
AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, BABE.
"WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO STAMP 'BOTTLE BREACHER'
ON EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THESE."
SO WE DID.
HE STAYED UP SO LATE.
O'Leary: WELL, I THINK THE NAME
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH SUCCESS.
IT'S CATCHY -- LIKE,
BREACHING AND OPENING.
Herjavec: YEAH,
IT'S A VERY GOOD NAME.
Eli: THANK YOU, SIR.
I MEAN, THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE.
Cuban: GIVE US
THE NAVY S.E.A.L. STORY.
YOU KNOW, I'M SO, SO HONORED
AND HUMBLED TO BE ABLE
TO SERVE WITH THE GUYS
THAT I GOT TO SERVE WITH
THE LAST EIGHT, NINE YEARS.
I DID THREE COMBAT DEPLOYMENTS
TO IRAQ.
THE FIRST TIME I WENT
TO S.E.A.L. TRAINING,
I DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH.
I ACTUALLY MADE IT
THROUGH THE HARDEST PORTION
OF S.E.A.L. TRAINING,
WHICH IS CALLED HELL WEEK,
AND THAT'S 5? DAYS
OF JUST GETTING YOUR BUTT KICKED
THE WHOLE TIME.
NO SLEEP WHATSOEVER, YOU'RE
COLD, WET, AND YOU'RE SANDY,
AND YOU'RE JUST GETTING
BEAT DOWN THE WHOLE TIME.
I MADE IT
THROUGH THAT WEEK.
ABOUT A WEEK
AND A HALF LATER,
THE INSTRUCTORS PULLED ME
INTO THEIR OFFICE,
AND THEY SAID, "YOUNG MAN,
Y-YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE HEART,
"BUT YOU'RE NOT
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
"AND WE NEED THE BEST
OF THE BEST HERE,
SO WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU OUT
TO THE FLEET."
I WAS ON A SHIP
FOR 2? YEARS.
IT WASN'T VERY FUN AT ALL.
Herjavec: WOW.
BUT I-I -- YOU KNOW,
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.
I PAID ATTENTION.
YOU KNOW,
AND 2? YEARS LATER,
I CAME BACK,
AND I MADE IT THROUGH.
AND I-I WANTED
TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO JENNIFER
AND I ARE.
WE DON'T GIVE UP.
YOU KNOW, LIFE IS FULL
OF OBSTACLES AND FAILURES,
AND WHEN WE FACE THAT,
WE DON'T RUN FOR THE HILLS.
WE JUST KEEP CHARGING ON,
AND WE FIGURE IT OUT.
SO, DO YOU DO ANY WEDDING SHOWS
OR ANYTHING?
WE HAVEN'T YET.
JUST BECAUSE, HONESTLY,
WHEN HE WAS ACTIVE DUTY,
I WAS AT HOME,
RUNNING THE BUSINESS.
WE WANTED TO WAIT TO EXPAND
TILL HE GOT OUT,
WHICH IS NEXT MONTH.
I JUST QUIT GOING IN
TO MY NAVY JOB TWO MONTHS AGO.
IT'S TWO-FOLD.
WHEN HE WAS DEPLOYED,
I HAD A REALLY TOUGH TIME,
AND THAT'S WHY I STARTED WORKING
ONLINE BY MYSELF AT NIGHT,
BECAUSE I WAS -- I WAS LONELY,
AND I WAS BY MYSELF.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
IN SAN DIEGO.
AND I GOT USED TO IT,
AND IT'S BEEN
A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.
AFTER THREE DEPLOYMENTS,
IT'S NOW TIME FOR HIM
TO COME HOME.
WE HAVE TWO GIRLS.
THEY ASK ABOUT DADDY.
AND, UM --
AWW.
NO, THEY DO.
AND THEY -- AND THEY MISS HIM.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LOOK.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I LIKE THE STORY.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
I'VE MADE MONEY WITH MILITARY
GUYS 'CAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED.
I'LL DO IT FOR 20%.
STRAIGHT EQUITY.
WOW.
THAT'S -- THAT --
I'M HONORED TO GET
THAT OFFER FROM YOU, SIR.
[ LAUGHS ]
NO, NO, NO.
I REALLY AM.
YOU KNOW WHY?
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET AN OFFER
LIKE THAT FROM YOU.
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN.
I LIKE YOUR STORY.
THAT -- THAT'S AWESOME.
I LIKE -- LISTEN,
I STRUCTURE MY DEALS
BASED ON THE RISK I'M TAKING,
AND I THINK THIS BUSINESS
CAN BE GROWN.
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE
THAT OFFER, AND I'D LIKE --
OUT OF RESPECT
FOR THE OTHER SHARKS,
I'D LIKE TO HEAR IF THERE ARE
ANY OTHER OFFERS BEFORE WE --
WELL, LET'S HEAR
IF THEY'RE INTERESTED.
Greiner: YOU ARE WONDERFUL.
Cuban: YOU'RE GOOD.
OUT OF RESPECT TO US,
YOU WANT TO HEAR OUR OFFERS.
YES, MA'AM.
YES, MA'AM.
I-I WANT TO HEAR IF THERE'S
ANY OTHER OFFERS OUT THERE.
WELL, RESPECT TO HIM
AS WELL.
WELL, LISTEN.
I LIKE YOU.
YOU HAVE A NICHE MARKET.
BUT I PERSONALLY -- I LIKE
BIG MARKETS, AND SO I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU
$200,000 FOR 25%.
BUT IT WOULD BE CONTINGENT
THAT I CAN GET THE LICENSES.
I WAS ALREADY THINKING
KEY RINGS AND PAPERWEIGHTS
AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS,
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RAMP UP
THAT QUICK,
AND I DON'T WANT THE KNOCK-OFFS
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD
TO KNOCK YOU OFF
AND GO DO IT THEMSELVES.
Herjavec: ELI, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES
LIKE A S.E.A.L. DOES.
$150,000 FOR 20% FROM KEVIN,
$200,000 FOR 25% FROM DAYMOND.
I'M GONNA CLEAR THE FIELD
SO YOU CAN CONSIDER THOSE.
I'M OUT.
MARK, WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN GOING IN
WITH EITHER
OF THE OTHER SHARKS?
I'D BE INTERESTING
IN GOING IN WITH KEVIN.
OKAY.
SO, MARK, DO YOU JUST WANT
TO SPLIT IT $75,000 EACH?
YEAH, WE'LL JUST -- YEAH,
YEAH, WE'LL JUST SPLIT IT.
10 POINTS EACH?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
SO, IF -- LET US SPLIT IT.
THAT'LL WORK.
O'Leary:
SO IT'S $150,000 FOR 20%.
MARK AND I EACH GET 10%.
YES, SIR.
SO WE'RE EACH GONNA PUT IN
$75,000.
YOU GOT TWO SHARKS,
NO CONTINGENCY.
WE'RE GOING STRAIGHT IN.
WE GO RIGHT TO WORK.
MR. CUBAN, MR. WONDERFUL,
YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!
LET'S DO IT!
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT.
YES!
Jen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
Cuban: WHY ARE YOU
STANDING HERE? GO TO WORK.
ALL RIGHT.
WE WILL.
O'Leary: GET ON IT.
THANKS, GUYS.
APPRECIATE IT.
AND THANKS FOR THE BEER.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: THANK YOU
FOR THE BULLET.
Eli: I TOLD JEN
FROM THE GET-GO,
I WANTED
TO LAND TWO SHARKS.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A SAYING
IN THE MILITARY --
"ONE IS NONE, TWO IS ONE."
WE WANTED TWO SHARKS,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE GOT TODAY.
ABSOLUTELY THRILLED, ESPECIALLY
WITH THE TWO THAT WE GOT.
IT'S JUST PERFECT.
YEAH.
REALLY WAS.
