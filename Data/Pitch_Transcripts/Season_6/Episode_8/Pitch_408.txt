WE BELIEVE IN THIS SO MUCH
WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVE
IS THE ULTIMATE MANLY GIFT.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ELI CRANE.
I'M HIS WIFE, JEN.
OUR BUSINESS
IS BOTTLE BREACHER.
WE ARE SEEKING $150,000
FOR 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR BUSINESS.
AT BOTTLE BREACHER, WE MAKE
THE FINEST PERSONALIZED
.50-CALIBER BOTTLE OPENERS
ON THE MARKET.
YOU MIGHT BE ASKING YOURSELF,
"WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT
A .50-CALIBER BOTTLE OPENER?"
SHORT ANSWER IS,
"THEY'RE AWESOME."
[ LAUGHS ]
AS A FORMER NAVY S.E.A.L.,
I KNEW I NEEDED
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY
WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE NAVY.
BOTTLE BREACHER HAS GIVEN US
THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.
I'LL TAKE IT.
Jen:
ROBERT, WE HAVE A RACECAR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I LIKE THAT.
Jen: YES.
IT'S GREAT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ELI.
CHEERS.
Cuban: CHEERS.
CHEERS, GUYS.
O'Leary: SO, ELI,
IS IT A REAL .50 CAL?
MR. WONDERFUL,
THAT IS A DUMMY ROUND.
WE USE RECYCLED BULLETS.
WE ARE BUYING
THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE,
SO THAT'S ONE PLACE WE KNOW,
IN THE FUTURE,
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY
SLASH OUR COSTS
BY GOING DIRECTLY
TO THE MANUFACTURER.
WHERE DO YOU SELL IT?
Jen: WELL,
WE SELL THEM ONLINE.
Eli: YES, SIR.
I'D LOVE TO ANSWER.
A BREACHER IS AN OPERATOR
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO GET US --
THE ASSAULTERS INTO WHATEVER
TARGET WE'RE HITTING.
Cuban:
GOES IN FIRST, RIGHT?
SO YOU GOT THAT BIG OLD DOOR --
YES, SIR.
WHETHER IT'S A SLEDGEHAMMER,
WHETHER IT'S A STRIP-CHARGE
EXPLOSIVE ON THE DOOR,
HE IS THE BREACHER.
THAT'S A QUALIFICATION
LIKE "SNIPER."
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO BREACH
INTO THAT BEER SOMEHOW, RIGHT?
YOU GOT TO GET IN THERE.
YOU GOT TO BREACH.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD FIRE OUT
OF, LIKE, AN ATTACK HELICOPTER
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
SO...
SO THIS IS LIKE --
Herjavec: OH!
OH, MY GOSH.
Cuban: OH, YEAH.
THIS IS THE MOTHER
OF ALL BULLETS.
John: OH, YEAH.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
COMPARE.
WE ACTUALLY CALL THAT
THE WMD --
THE WEAPON
OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
YOU GET ANY RESISTANCE
BECAUSE IT'S A BULLET?
NOTHING REALLY HARMFUL.
Jen: THAT'S WHERE THE STORE'S
COMING FROM.
AFTER THE EPISODE,
I LOOKED AT JEN,
Eli: THANK YOU, SIR.
I MEAN, THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE.
Cuban: GIVE US
THE NAVY S.E.A.L. STORY.
Herjavec: ELI, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES
LIKE A S.E.A.L. DOES.
$150,000 FOR 20% FROM KEVIN,
$200,000 FOR 25% FROM DAYMOND.
I'M GONNA CLEAR THE FIELD
SO YOU CAN CONSIDER THOSE.
I'M OUT.
MARK, WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN GOING IN
WITH EITHER
OF THE OTHER SHARKS?
I'D BE INTERESTING
IN GOING IN WITH KEVIN.
OKAY.
SO, MARK, DO YOU JUST WANT
TO SPLIT IT $75,000 EACH?
YEAH, WE'LL JUST -- YEAH,
YEAH, WE'LL JUST SPLIT IT.
10 POINTS EACH?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
SO, IF -- LET US SPLIT IT.
THAT'LL WORK.
O'Leary:
SO IT'S $150,000 FOR 20%.
Jen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
Eli: I TOLD JEN
FROM THE GET-GO,
