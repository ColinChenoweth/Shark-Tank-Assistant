HI.
MY NAME'S AARON TWEEDIE,
AND I'M FROM FRONT ROYAL,
VIRGINIA.
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING $200,000
FOR A 29% STAKE IN MY COMPANY,
MAN-PACK.
THE MAN-PACK IS A SLING-STYLE
VERTICAL MESSENGER BAG
DESIGNED BY GUYS, FOR GUYS.
YOU KNOW, 40 YEARS AGO,
MEN CARRIED NOTHING MORE
THAN A MONEY CLIP,
BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED.
ON AVERAGE, GUYS NOW CARRY
4.5 POUNDS OF STUFF,
THINGS LIKE KEYS, CELLPHONES,
TABLETS, ENERGY DRINKS.
POINT IS, GUYS NEED
TO CARRY STUFF,
AND WE HAVE VERY FEW OPTIONS.
WE HAVE THE BACKPACK,
THE BRIEFCASE,
THE TRADITIONAL MESSENGER BAG,
AND I'M SURE ALL OF YOU
REMEMBER THE FANNY PACK.
I HAVE DESIGNED
A SUPERIOR PRODUCT
THAT I CALL URBAN TACTICAL.
YOU CAN WEAR THIS THING
THREE DIFFERENT WAYS.
FIRST WAY IS BANDOLEER STYLE.
IF YOU NEED
TO TAKE IT OFF QUICKLY,
IT HAS A QUICK-RELEASE CLASP.
A CHEST-MOUNTED UTILITY POCKET
FOR YOUR CELLPHONE
WITH A MAGNETIC BUTTON CLOSURE.
LINE IT UP, LOCKS ITSELF SHUT.
THREE ROWS OF MOLLE
FOR TACTICAL GEAR,
AND A COLLAPSIBLE
BEVERAGE HOLDER.
WHEN YOU NEED IT, IT'S THERE.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHEN YOU DON'T, IT FOLDS UP --
NOT THE COLLAPSIBLE
BEVERAGE HOLDER!
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
...IT FOLDS UP
AND OUT OF THE WAY.
TO GET INTO IT, YOU DON'T NEED
TO TAKE IT OFF.
JUST SPIN IT AROUND
AND OPEN IT UP.
PLUS, YOU HAVE AUXILIARY POCKETS
FOR THINGS LIKE YOUR WALLET,
LOOSE POCKET CHANGE, KEYS.
NOW, IF YOU'RE SOMEPLACE
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT
ON AND OFF FREQUENTLY,
YOU CAN THROW IT
OVER ONE SHOULDER.
NOTICE HOW THE WEIGHT STILL
HANGS OVER YOUR LOWER BACK
DUE TO THE ERGONOMIC DESIGN
OF THE STRAP.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND IF YOU'RE IN THE CITY
ON THE METRO,
YOU CAN WEAR IT REVERSE,
KEEP YOUR POSSESSIONS
IN FRONT OF YOU
AND SAFE FROM PICKPOCKETS.
THE MISSION STATEMENT
OF MAN-PACK
IS TO MAKE MEN MORE PREPARED,
BECAUSE A PREPARED MAN
IS A BETTER MAN.
WITH YOUR SUPPORT,
WE CAN TURN THE "MAN-BAG MARKET"
INTO THE MAN-PACK MARKET.
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
TO PRESENT,
AND I'D BE HAPPY
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
Herjavec: AARON,
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
GET IT, BABY.
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU --
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
ARE YOU A DESIGNER?
UH, NO.
I BUILT MY FIRST HOUSE
WHEN I WAS 19,
AND I WAS IN FORT BENNING,
GEORGIA, WHEN I WAS 17.
WERE YOU IN THE ARMY?
I WAS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FIRST
WALKED IN, I LOOKED AT IT
AND I THOUGHT, "OH,
ANOTHER KNAPSACK FOR GUYS.
WHATEVER."
BUT YOU DEFINITELY WOWED ME
WITH THE UTILITY OF IT.
CAN WE SEE THEM?
CAN YOU HAND -- CAN
WE TAKE A LOOK AT ONE?
SURE. YES.
FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
HERE YOU GO.
O'Leary:
GIVE ME THE BLACK ONE.
THANKS.
YOU GET THE XL.
YEAH.
Herjavec:
YEAH, HE NEEDS THE XL.
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: THANK YOU, SIR.
APPRECIATE IT.
HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY OF THESE?
Tweedie: I HAVE. I HAVE.
Greiner: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
John: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
OKAY.
SO, LAST YEAR, $76,000.
THIS YEAR, WE'RE AT $65,000,
YEAR TO DATE.
Greiner: IS THAT ONLINE?
IT IS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS YEAR?
$145,000.
WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?
$59.95.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE THEM FOR?
Greiner:
WHAT DO YOU MAKE THEM FOR?
THEY COST, RIGHT NOW,
$22.05 A PIECE.
SO THIS PRODUCT
REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION,
'CAUSE IT'S HARD
TO DIFFERENTIATE IT
AGAINST ANYTHING ELSE.
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE THE CONSUMER
BECAUSE THIS IS
AN EMERGING MARKET.
BAGS ARE EMERGING MARKET?
THIS IS THE MILLENNIAL
VERSION OF THE MURSE.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT IT'S NOT -- RIGHT.
IT'S NOT A PURSE,
IT'S NOT A BACKPACK.
IT'S A MURSE!
YOU KNOW WHAT --
IT'S A MAN -- IT'S A MAN-PACK.
Herjavec: BUT, AARON,
HERE'S THE CONCERN.
SURE. OKAY.
WHEN I WAS EUROPE LAST SUMMER
WITH MY FAMILY...
RIGHT.
...I HAD A SIMILAR BAG,
AND I WASN'T ASHAMED
TO WEAR IT IN PUBLIC
BECAUSE EVERY OTHER GUY
IN EUROPE HAD ONE.
EXACTLY.
WHEN I CAME BACK HERE,
I PUT THE SAME THING ON,
I DIDN'T MAKE IT ONE BLOCK
DOWN THE STREET,
EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING AT ME.
YOU KNOW, IT --
Greiner:
BUT THAT'S NOT A MURSE.
ROBERT, I DON'T THINK THEY
WERE LAUGHING AT YOU FOR THAT.
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF THINGS.
ONE, IT'S NOT A MURSE.
WHEN YOU SEE THE GUYS
THAT I SELL TO,
THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
AND MILITARY PERSONNEL
AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL --
I NEVER LAUGH AT SOMEBODY
WITH A GUN.
RIGHT. EXACTLY.
WELL, LET'S GO
TO THE REAL NUMBERS.
HOW MANY DID YOU SELL
LAST MONTH, ONLINE ONLY?
PROBABLY LIKE 40.
THAT'S --
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S NOT GOOD.
BUT I STARTED THIS WITH $5,000.
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT
WITH NEXT TO NOTHING.
WHY DO YOU THINK
THE COMPANY'S WORTH $700,000?
OKAY, UM, $50,000 FOR
THE DESIGN PATENT, WHICH WE --
BUT WHAT DID YOU GET
THE DESIGN PATENT FOR?
FOR THIS MODEL.
LIKE, WHAT --
A BAG WITH A STRAP
THAT HAS SO MANY POCKETS?
Greiner: JUST THE LOOK OF IT.
IT'S JUST THE LOOK OF IT.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU ADDING
TO THE VALUE?
A MULTIPLE OF SALES
FOR TWO YEARS
BEING THE $145,000 PROJECTION.
$18,000 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,
THAT BEING THE BANK OF YOUTUBE
COMMERCIALS THAT I'VE CREATED.
THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY.
YOU SHOULD CHECK THEM OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU'RE PUTTING A HARD VALUE
ON THOSE?
VALUE IS A MATTER
OF PERCEPTION.
YES, IT IS.
AND WE'RE ON --
IF WE'RE ON AN ISLAND
AND YOU HAVE A BAR OF GOLD I
HAVE A CHEESEBURGER, WHO'S RICH?
I'LL TAKE THE GOLD.
OKAY.
I'M GONNA GET IN THE PLANE
AND LEAVE THE ISLAND.
[ LAUGHS ]
John: LET'S GO -- ROBERT,
HOLD ON. ARE WE DONE?
ARE WE DONE
WITH ALL THE NUMBERS?
I WAS JUST --
N-NO.
UM, OKAY,
AND $200,000 IN GOOD WILL.
AND $200,000
IN GOOD WILL.
[ LAUGHS ]
O'Leary:
IF I GAVE YOU $200,000,
I'D HAVE TO OWN
ABOUT 260% OF THE COMPANY.
ABOUT THAT.
'CAUSE YOU HAVE
VERY SMALL SALES.
THAT'S THE REASON I'M OUT.
I'M JUST A DISCIPLINED
FINANCIAL INVESTOR.
I UNDERSTAND.
Cuban: I KIND OF AGREE
WITH KEVIN.
I THINK THIS -- THIS IS
A HARD BUSINESS TO INVEST IN.
I THINK YOU'RE A HUSTLER,
AND YOU'RE A GREAT SALESPERSON.
I JUST THINK IT'S HARD
FOR YOU TO SCALE,
WHICH MAKES IT HARD
TO INVEST IN.
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
WE SEE MANY PEOPLE
WITH, UM, GOOD SALES, BAD SALES,
AND THEN WE NORMALLY BET
ON THE PERSON.
AND THANK YOU
FOR SERVING OUR COUNTRY.
THANK YOU.
WE ALSO LOOK
FOR SMALL INDICATIONS
ON HOW GOOD
THIS PARTNER WOULD BE.
YOUR "I'M GONNA CHARGE
$20,000 FOR THE --"
YOUR VIDEOS, THAT YOU
MAY HAVE MADE AT HOME --
IT INDICATED
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
A SENSE OF FINANCIAL
INTELLIGENCE
WHEN IT COMES
TO WHAT PARTNERS NEED
IN OPERATING THIS BUSINESS.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
AS IMPRESSED AS I AM WITH YOU,
TO ME, IT LOOKS LIKE
A MESSENGER BAG.
SO YOU'VE GOT TO GO,
AND YOU GOT TO RUN
REAL FAST, BABY.
YOU GOT TO GET OUT THERE.
BUT THAT'S A JOURNEY
FOR YOU.
AND YOU'RE A TOUGH GUY,
EX-MILITARY.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
I JUST -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO IT IN THE TIME FRAME
THAT I WANT TO DO IT IN.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
Greiner: I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH
ABOUT WHAT MEN CARRY AROUND.
BUT I DO KNOW THAT,
IN ALL MY YEARS IN RETAIL
AND ON QVC
AND CREATING PRODUCTS,
THE HARDEST THING IS
WHEN THERE'S JUST A TON
OF COMPETITION
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN SURE HOW
POPULAR THE MARKET IS FOR IT.
AND WE'RE NOT SURE
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE
BUYING THE PRODUCT.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
VERY WELL.
I WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST, THOUGH.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.
GOOD LUCK, AARON.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.
John: GOOD LUCK.
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THAT
THEY DIDN'T LIKE MY VALUATION.
I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO HAVE 70% OF THE BUSINESS
FOR 20 GRAND.
AND, YOU KNOW, I LOOKED FORWARD
INTO THE FUTURE,
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA BE
WORTH A LOT MORE
BECAUSE I'M GONNA MAKE IT WORTH
A LOT MORE.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A MILITARY COUPLE
