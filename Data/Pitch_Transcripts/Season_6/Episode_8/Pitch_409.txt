HI.
MY NAME'S AARON TWEEDIE,
Herjavec: AARON,
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
GET IT, BABY.
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU --
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
ARE YOU A DESIGNER?
UH, NO.
I BUILT MY FIRST HOUSE
WHEN I WAS 19,
Tweedie: I HAVE. I HAVE.
Greiner: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
John: WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
OKAY.
SO, LAST YEAR, $76,000.
THIS YEAR, WE'RE AT $65,000,
YEAR TO DATE.
Greiner: IS THAT ONLINE?
IT IS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS YEAR?
$145,000.
WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?
$59.95.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE THEM FOR?
Greiner:
WHAT DO YOU MAKE THEM FOR?
THEY COST, RIGHT NOW,
$22.05 A PIECE.
SO THIS PRODUCT
REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION,
'CAUSE IT'S HARD
TO DIFFERENTIATE IT
AGAINST ANYTHING ELSE.
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE THE CONSUMER
BECAUSE THIS IS
AN EMERGING MARKET.
BAGS ARE EMERGING MARKET?
THIS IS THE MILLENNIAL
VERSION OF THE MURSE.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT IT'S NOT -- RIGHT.
IT'S NOT A PURSE,
IT'S NOT A BACKPACK.
IT'S A MURSE!
YOU KNOW WHAT --
IT'S A MAN -- IT'S A MAN-PACK.
Herjavec: BUT, AARON,
HERE'S THE CONCERN.
SURE. OKAY.
WHEN I WAS EUROPE LAST SUMMER
WITH MY FAMILY...
RIGHT.
...I HAD A SIMILAR BAG,
GOOD LUCK, AARON.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.
John: GOOD LUCK.
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THAT
THEY DIDN'T LIKE MY VALUATION.
I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED
