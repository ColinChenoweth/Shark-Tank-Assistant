LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
OVER 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
RENOWNED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
LORI, PINK.
I MEAN, WHAT FEMALE DOESN'T
LIKE TO WORK OUT IN PINK?
KEVIN, THIS IS THE COLOR
OF YOUR SOUL -- BLACK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, YEAH.
DAYMOND, BACK TO YOUR
FUBU ROOTS -- RED AND BLACK.
AND MARK --
I MEAN, SHOULD I SAY IT?
THANK YOU.
MY NAME'S LORI MORRELL
AND I'M FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO.
I'M THE OWNER
OF PRIORITY 1 CANINE.
I'M HERE SEEKING $75,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 15% OF MY COMPANY.
TRAINING A DOG TAKES A LOT
OF TIME AND PATIENCE,
BUT IT ALL PAYS OFF IN THE END
WHEN YOUR BEST FRIEND IS THERE
FOR WHEN YOU NEED HIM THE MOST.
HEY, LADY!
[ DOG BARKING ]
LIKE MAYBE WHEN
YOUR SAFETY'S IN DANGER.
DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?
GIVE ME YOUR MONEY!
I KNOW YOU HAVE MONEY.
GIVE YOUR MONEY!
Herjavec: WHOA!
WHOA!
OH, MY GOD!
[ SPEAKS DUTCH ]
WOW!
[ DOG BARKS ]
I WANT THAT DOG.
[ LORI SPEAKS DUTCH ]
Wade: HEY, SHARKS.
HOW YOU DOING?
MY NAME IS WADE MORRELL.
I'M LORI'S HUSBAND
AND THE CO-OWNER
OF PRIORITY 1 CANINE.
WE TRAIN AND SELL THE WORLD'S
FINEST CANINE BODYGUARDS
FOR PERSONAL, HOME,
AND FAMILY SECURITY.
Lori: YOU'RE PROBABLY
ASKING YOURSELF
"WHO NEEDS A PERSONAL
CANINE BODYGUARD?"
THE ANSWER MIGHT BE YOU.
THE AVERAGE POLICE
RESPONSE TIME IN AMERICA
IS 7 TO 10 MINUTES.
THAT'S 7 TO 10 MINUTES
THAT YOU JUST CAN'T WASTE.
WE HAND-SELECT AND TRAIN
EACH CANINE
TO MEET OUR CLIENT'S INDIVIDUAL
PERSONAL SECURITY NEEDS,
WHETHER IT BE PROTECTION
FROM CARJACKING,
PERIMETER SECURITY,
OR PERSONAL SECURITY
WHILE AT HOME OR AWAY.
SO, SHARKS, WHICH ONE OF YOU
WOULD LIKE TO TEAM UP WITH US
[ LORI SPEAKS DUTCH ]
Herjavec:
LORI, THAT WAS SO COOL.
BUT FOR ME
TO REALLY GET IT,
I NEED TO SEE
THE DEMO AGAIN.
CAN KEVIN PUT ON
THE CLOTHES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT LANGUAGE ARE YOU
SPEAKING TO THE DOG?
Lori: DUTCH.
Herjavec: IS SHE FRIENDLY,
OR IS SHE SO TIGHTLY WOUND
THAT SHE CAN'T BE
A FAMILY PET?
Lori: OH, NO.
ALL OF OUR CANINES
ARE FAMILY PETS.
THEY LIVE IN THE HOME
WITH -- WITH THE FAMILY.
WHY IS SHE STARING AT HIM
SO INTENTLY?
SHE'S IN PROTECTION MODE
RIGHT NOW.
FOR YOU?
YES.
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING.
I WOULD LIKE TO EXCUSE HER
SO WE GET BACK TO THE --
THE NITTY-GRITTY OF THINGS.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
ROXY [SPEAKS DUTCH]
WOW, THAT'S INTENSE.
Herjavec:
THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE.
THAT'S A VERY
TIGHTLY WOUND ANIMAL.
ALMOST A -- IT IS A WEAPON.
CAN YOU DO THE SAME THING
WITH, LET'S SAY, A CHIHUAHUA?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IS IT ONLY GERMAN SHEPHERDS?
Wade: NO, WE --
WE SPECIFICALLY USE
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT
PREDOMINANT BREEDS --
THE BELGIAN SHEPHERD,
LIKE YOU SAW TODAY,
OR THE BELGIAN MALINOIS,
THE DUTCH SHEPHERD,
AND THE ALSO
THE GERMAN SHEPHERD.
WE ACTUALLY
HAND-SELECT THE DOG
THAT'S GONNA MEET
YOUR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS.
WE COME TO YOUR HOUSE,
WE SEE HOW YOU LIVE.
DO YOU HAVE KIDS?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO USE THE DOG FOR?
WALK ME THROUGH NUMBERS.
I NEED A DOG.
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE ME?
WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT
TRAINING PACKAGES.
WE HAVE A LEVEL ONE,
WHICH IS A $20,000
TRAINING PACKAGE --
DOES THAT INCLUDE THE DOG?
THAT INCLUDES THE DOG,
YES.
...A LEVEL TWO,
WHICH IS A $30,000,
AND THEN A LEVEL THREE,
WHICH IS A $40,000 PACKAGE.
AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
IT GOES ON THE --
THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING
THAT'S PUT INTO THE DOG.
SO THE BASIC LEVEL ONE DOG
WOULD BE A DOG THAT,
IF SOMEONE WAS TO COME
TO YOUR HOUSE,
RING THE DOORBELL,
THE DOG WOULD GO TO
THE FRONT DOOR AND BARK
AND LOOK
LIKE A THREATENING DOG.
LEVEL TWO, WE START GOING INTO
HIGHER LEVELS OF TRAINING --
IF YOU'RE A JOGGER
OR IF YOU WANT
A CARJACKING SCENARIO
PLACED INTO THE DOG.
ONCE YOU GET INTO
A LEVEL THREE DOG,
YOU GET THE FULL SHEBANG.
YOU KNOW, I'M CURIOUS
ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND,
BECAUSE YOU FEEL TO ME
LIKE MAYBE ARMY,
S.E.A.L.s, SOMETHING.
YES, MA'AM.
I'M A FORMER
UNITED STATES MARINE.
I'VE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER
FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS.
S.W.A.T. TEAMS,
POLICE DEPARTMENTS
ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES
REQUEST ME TO TEACH THEM
HOW TO DO THIS
WITH THEIR DOGS.
AND, LORI,
ARE YOU INVOLVED, TOO?
YES, I ACTUALLY CAME
FROM CORPORATE AMERICA.
BUT I CAME HOME ONE DAY,
AND I TOLD WADE --
I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING WITH ANIMALS."
AND HE GOES, "GO FOR IT."
HOW MANY DOGS DID YOU SELL, OR
WHATEVER THE TERM IS, LAST YEAR?
Cuban: WERE PLACED LAST YEAR?
HOW MANY DOGS
HAVE YOU PLACED SO FAR?
WE'VE TRAINED AND PLACED
11 DOGS SO FAR.
THIS YEAR?
Wade: IN THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF.
Lori: IN THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF.
YES, SIR.
WHAT ARE YOUR REVENUES?
IT'S ABOUT $150,000,
AND WE MADE ABOUT $75,000.
THE INHERENT PROBLEM HERE
IS SCALABILITY.
HOW DO I TURN THIS INTO A
MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS?
I THINK THAT'S
VERY, VERY CHALLENGING.
THIS IS SUCH
A PERFECT THING FOR YOU.
NO, IT'S --
LIKE, DOG
THAT RIPS SOMEONE'S --
NO, I LIKE THAT PART
BECAUSE I COULD JUST SAY --
YOU KNOW, CUBAN'S COMPETING
WITH ME ON A DEAL,
I JUST SEND THE DOG OVER.
YEAH.
Greiner: MM-HMM.
THAT'S IT.
Wade: I DON'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT YOU, SIR,
BUT IF WE DO 20 DOGS A YEAR
AT $40,000,
THAT'S $800,000 A YEAR.
I'VE NEVER BEEN A RICH PERSON.
I PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE.
THAT'S PLENTY OF MONEY
TO ME.
THAT IS A FANTASTIC LIVING
FOR YOU.
BUT EVEN AT $800,000,
AS AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS,
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
TO SCALE THAT KIND OF THING.
IF WE 9 NINE DOGS A MONTH,
72 DOGS A YEAR...
YEAH, BUT, LORI, HERE'S --
...WE'RE LOOKING
AT $2.4 MILLION.
YEAH, HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
IT'S YOU.
IT'S SUCH A HANDS-ON
TYPE OF BUSINESS.
A WEAPON LIKE THAT
IS HIGHLY, HIGHLY TRAINED
THAT NEEDS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
TO CONSTANTLY RETUNE IT.
AND WE DO THAT.
YEAH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S --
BUT AGAIN, IT GOES TO MY POINT.
IT'S YOU.
I DON'T THINK YOU FOUND
AN INVESTOR IN ME TODAY.
PERHAPS A CUSTOMER.
I'M OUT.
IF YOU GOT THIS UP
TO $1 MILLION IN SALES,
WHICH I THINK YOU COULD...
YEAH.
...IT'S NOT REALLY INTERESTING
FOR AN INVESTOR.
WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES
TO PUT OUR CAPITAL
IN MAY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
WE LOOK FOR
UNLIMITED SCALABILITY.
I-I DON'T SEE IT HERE.
I'M OUT.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT, KEVIN.
WE REALLY NEED A PARTNER
TO HELP US HERE.
WE'RE NOT -- I JUST --
I JUST BEEN A MARINE,
A POLICE OFFICER, AND A DOG
TRAINER MY WHOLE LIFE.
I NEED SOMEBODY
WITH THAT LITTLE BIT
OF EXTRA BUSINESS SENSE
TO HELP US TAKE THIS -- THIS
BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE IT WON'T BE A $5 MILLION
OR $10 MILLION COMPANY.
MAYBE WE DO $2 MILLION.
BUT HOW --
BUT YOU MAY GET TO $2 MILLION
ON YOUR OWN,
AND THAT'S A GREAT LIVING
FOR YOU GUYS.
Cuban: THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES
OF INVESTMENTS.
FOR SOME, THEY JUST NEED
THE CASH, RIGHT?
AND FOR OTHERS,
THEY WANT CONTACTS
AND EXPERTISE AND MENTORING.
CONTACTS, EXPERTISE,
AND MENTORING IS EXPENSIVE
FROM OUR END,
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
GETTING TO $2 MILLION
RELATIVE TO OUR TIME,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE TIME
THAN THE REWARD WOULD BE,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
Greiner:
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY IMPRESSIVE.
I COULD TELL THE MINUTE
YOU WALKED IN
YOU HAD A MILITARY BACKGROUND.
YOU CALLED EVERYBODY "SIR"
CONSTANTLY, KEPT YOUR COOL.
I THINK TO THE POINT
THE OTHER SHARKS ARE SAYING
IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCALE IT
REALLY HUGE.
IF YOU MAKE A GREAT LIVING
OFF IT, THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED,
AND I DON'T SAY THAT VERY OFTEN.
IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US
TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM IT
OR TO BE ABLE
TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOU.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
BUT I SEE YOU AS WINNERS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MA'AM.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
DAYMOND, Y-YOU'RE
A HUGE DOG LOVER.
John: I AM.
AND IF YOU CAN COME OVER AND
TEACH LITTLE BLAKE AND SPARTAN
TO PEE ON THE WEE-WEE PAD,
I WOULD SAY SO MANY THINGS.
HIS CHIHUAHUA.
DONE.
I'M NOT SURE
THOSE ARE DOGS.
THEY ARE.
THEY'RE LITTLE HOT DOGS.
SO I'M A PRODUCT GUY,
AND, YOU KNOW,
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION,
LICENSING.
I DON'T THINK I CAN HELP YOU
IN THAT SERVICE.
YOU CAN. YOU CAN.
YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY HELP US.
BUT I CAN'T TURN YOUR BUSINESS
INTO A BIG BUSINESS
WHERE I CAN GET ACTUALLY
A RETURN ON MY CAPITAL.
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY
AWESOME EXPERIENCE FOR US.
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR SUCCESS.
YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT BUSINESS.
GREAT JOB.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
I WANT THE KILLER CHIHUAHUA
TO TAKE HIM OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
Cuban: CONGRATS, GUYS.
Wade: THANKS.
APPRECIATE IT.
THAT IS SO YOUR BUSINESS.
O'Leary: ARE YOU KIDDING?
A DOG THAT WILL CUT
YOUR THROAT OPEN.
IF THAT WAS AROUND
WITH YOUNG KIDS
AND IT JUST HAD A BAD HAIR DAY,
IT WOULD EAT SOMEBODY'S HEAD.
[ LAUGHS ]
Wade:
OUR GOAL WAS TO COME IN
AND SHOW THE SHARKS
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF BUSINESS,
KIND OF BLOW
THEIR DOORS OFF.
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
LITTLE BUMMED.
AND DISAPPOINTED.
YEAH.
YEAH.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
WITH A BETTER VERSION
OF THE MODERN MAN BAG.
LORI, THAT'S THE FIRST PINK
BREACHER WE'VE EVER MADE,
IN YOUR HONOR.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE RUDE
AND HAVE YOU GUYS
DRINK ALONE...
Cuban:
YOU NEVER DRINK ALONE.
...I'M GONNA HAVE A DRINK
WITH YOU GUYS.
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM, LORI.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
I MEAN, IT'S A REALITY.
ABSOLUTELY.
WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE
BE LIKE, "OH, I HATE THAT."
WELL, LIKE,
THEN DON'T BUY IT.
O'Leary: WHERE DO YOU NEED
TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY?
LET'S SAY THIS IS A HUGE HIT
ON "SHARK TANK"
AND YOU GET AN ORDER
FOR 50,000 UNITS.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?
I KNOW AT THAT NUMBER,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEASE
ANOTHER INCUBATOR SPACE.
I'M ALSO GONNA
HAVE TO GET --
IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED
THE $150,000 FOR?
YES, SIR. THAT --
PART OF IT.
AS WE GROW, WE COULD DOUBLE
IN SIZE RIGHT NOW
IN THE SPACE
THAT WE'RE IN.
BUT IF IT STARTS
GOING BIGGER THAN THAT --
INSIDE THAT SPACE,
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BUY?
OKAY, SO, WE NEED
MORE ENGRAVERS.
EVERY -- YOU KNOW, 90%
OF OUR ORDERS ARE CUSTOMIZED.
WHAT STOPS ANYBODY ELSE
FROM DOING THIS?
OKAY, THAT'S --
AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
AND WE DO HAVE
COMPETITION.
THANKS
TO MR. WONDERFUL HERE,
WE WERE ACTUALLY WATCHING
AN EPISODE OF "SHARK TANK,"
AND MR. WONDERFUL
WAS RIPPING APART
AN ENTREPRENEUR
BECAUSE HE --
HE NEVER DOES THAT.
Greiner: TYPICAL DAY.
...HE DID NOT BRAND
ON HIS PRODUCT,
AND AS SOON
AS IT LEFT THE PACKAGE,
YOU COULDN'T TELL IT
FROM THE OTHER ONES.
