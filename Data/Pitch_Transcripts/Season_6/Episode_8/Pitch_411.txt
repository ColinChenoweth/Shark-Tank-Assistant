MY NAME'S LORI MORRELL
AND I'M FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO.
I'M THE OWNER
OF PRIORITY 1 CANINE.
I'M HERE SEEKING $75,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 15% OF MY COMPANY.
TRAINING A DOG TAKES A LOT
OF TIME AND PATIENCE,
BUT IT ALL PAYS OFF IN THE END
WHEN YOUR BEST FRIEND IS THERE
FOR WHEN YOU NEED HIM THE MOST.
HEY, LADY!
[ DOG BARKING ]
LIKE MAYBE WHEN
YOUR SAFETY'S IN DANGER.
DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?
GIVE ME YOUR MONEY!
I KNOW YOU HAVE MONEY.
GIVE YOUR MONEY!
Herjavec: WHOA!
WHOA!
OH, MY GOD!
[ SPEAKS DUTCH ]
WOW!
[ DOG BARKS ]
I WANT THAT DOG.
[ LORI SPEAKS DUTCH ]
Wade: HEY, SHARKS.
HOW YOU DOING?
MY NAME IS WADE MORRELL.
I'M LORI'S HUSBAND
AND THE CO-OWNER
OF PRIORITY 1 CANINE.
WE TRAIN AND SELL THE WORLD'S
FINEST CANINE BODYGUARDS
FOR PERSONAL, HOME,
AND FAMILY SECURITY.
Lori: YOU'RE PROBABLY
ASKING YOURSELF
"WHO NEEDS A PERSONAL
CANINE BODYGUARD?"
THE ANSWER MIGHT BE YOU.
THE AVERAGE POLICE
RESPONSE TIME IN AMERICA
IS 7 TO 10 MINUTES.
THAT'S 7 TO 10 MINUTES
THAT YOU JUST CAN'T WASTE.
WE HAND-SELECT AND TRAIN
EACH CANINE
TO MEET OUR CLIENT'S INDIVIDUAL
PERSONAL SECURITY NEEDS,
WHETHER IT BE PROTECTION
FROM CARJACKING,
PERIMETER SECURITY,
OR PERSONAL SECURITY
WHILE AT HOME OR AWAY.
SO, SHARKS, WHICH ONE OF YOU
WOULD LIKE TO TEAM UP WITH US
[ LORI SPEAKS DUTCH ]
Herjavec:
LORI, THAT WAS SO COOL.
BUT FOR ME
TO REALLY GET IT,
I NEED TO SEE
THE DEMO AGAIN.
CAN KEVIN PUT ON
THE CLOTHES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT LANGUAGE ARE YOU
SPEAKING TO THE DOG?
Lori: DUTCH.
Herjavec: IS SHE FRIENDLY,
OR IS SHE SO TIGHTLY WOUND
THAT SHE CAN'T BE
A FAMILY PET?
Lori: OH, NO.
ALL OF OUR CANINES
ARE FAMILY PETS.
THEY LIVE IN THE HOME
WITH -- WITH THE FAMILY.
WHY IS SHE STARING AT HIM
SO INTENTLY?
SHE'S IN PROTECTION MODE
RIGHT NOW.
FOR YOU?
YES.
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING.
I WOULD LIKE TO EXCUSE HER
SO WE GET BACK TO THE --
THE NITTY-GRITTY OF THINGS.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
ROXY [SPEAKS DUTCH]
WOW, THAT'S INTENSE.
Herjavec:
THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE.
THAT'S A VERY
TIGHTLY WOUND ANIMAL.
ALMOST A -- IT IS A WEAPON.
CAN YOU DO THE SAME THING
WITH, LET'S SAY, A CHIHUAHUA?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IS IT ONLY GERMAN SHEPHERDS?
Wade: NO, WE --
WE SPECIFICALLY USE
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT
PREDOMINANT BREEDS --
THE BELGIAN SHEPHERD,
LIKE YOU SAW TODAY,
OR THE BELGIAN MALINOIS,
THE DUTCH SHEPHERD,
AND THE ALSO
THE GERMAN SHEPHERD.
WE ACTUALLY
HAND-SELECT THE DOG
THAT'S GONNA MEET
YOUR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS.
WE COME TO YOUR HOUSE,
WE SEE HOW YOU LIVE.
DO YOU HAVE KIDS?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO USE THE DOG FOR?
WALK ME THROUGH NUMBERS.
I NEED A DOG.
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE ME?
WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT
TRAINING PACKAGES.
WE HAVE A LEVEL ONE,
WHICH IS A $20,000
TRAINING PACKAGE --
DOES THAT INCLUDE THE DOG?
THAT INCLUDES THE DOG,
YES.
...A LEVEL TWO,
WHICH IS A $30,000,
AND THEN A LEVEL THREE,
WHICH IS A $40,000 PACKAGE.
AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
IT GOES ON THE --
THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING
THAT'S PUT INTO THE DOG.
SO THE BASIC LEVEL ONE DOG
WOULD BE A DOG THAT,
IF SOMEONE WAS TO COME
TO YOUR HOUSE,
RING THE DOORBELL,
THE DOG WOULD GO TO
THE FRONT DOOR AND BARK
AND LOOK
LIKE A THREATENING DOG.
LEVEL TWO, WE START GOING INTO
HIGHER LEVELS OF TRAINING --
IF YOU'RE A JOGGER
OR IF YOU WANT
A CARJACKING SCENARIO
PLACED INTO THE DOG.
ONCE YOU GET INTO
A LEVEL THREE DOG,
YOU GET THE FULL SHEBANG.
YOU KNOW, I'M CURIOUS
ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND,
BECAUSE YOU FEEL TO ME
LIKE MAYBE ARMY,
S.E.A.L.s, SOMETHING.
YES, MA'AM.
I'M A FORMER
UNITED STATES MARINE.
I'VE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER
FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS.
S.W.A.T. TEAMS,
POLICE DEPARTMENTS
ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES
REQUEST ME TO TEACH THEM
HOW TO DO THIS
WITH THEIR DOGS.
AND, LORI,
ARE YOU INVOLVED, TOO?
YES, I ACTUALLY CAME
FROM CORPORATE AMERICA.
BUT I CAME HOME ONE DAY,
AND I TOLD WADE --
I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING WITH ANIMALS."
AND HE GOES, "GO FOR IT."
HOW MANY DOGS DID YOU SELL, OR
WHATEVER THE TERM IS, LAST YEAR?
Cuban: WERE PLACED LAST YEAR?
HOW MANY DOGS
HAVE YOU PLACED SO FAR?
WE'VE TRAINED AND PLACED
11 DOGS SO FAR.
THIS YEAR?
Wade: IN THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF.
Lori: IN THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF.
YES, SIR.
WHAT ARE YOUR REVENUES?
IT'S ABOUT $150,000,
AND WE MADE ABOUT $75,000.
THE INHERENT PROBLEM HERE
IS SCALABILITY.
HOW DO I TURN THIS INTO A
MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS?
I THINK THAT'S
VERY, VERY CHALLENGING.
THIS IS SUCH
A PERFECT THING FOR YOU.
NO, IT'S --
LIKE, DOG
THAT RIPS SOMEONE'S --
NO, I LIKE THAT PART
BECAUSE I COULD JUST SAY --
YOU KNOW, CUBAN'S COMPETING
WITH ME ON A DEAL,
I JUST SEND THE DOG OVER.
YEAH.
Greiner: MM-HMM.
THAT'S IT.
Wade: I DON'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT YOU, SIR,
BUT IF WE DO 20 DOGS A YEAR
AT $40,000,
THAT'S $800,000 A YEAR.
I'VE NEVER BEEN A RICH PERSON.
I PROBABLY NEVER WILL BE.
THAT'S PLENTY OF MONEY
TO ME.
THAT IS A FANTASTIC LIVING
FOR YOU.
BUT EVEN AT $800,000,
AS AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS,
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
TO SCALE THAT KIND OF THING.
IF WE 9 NINE DOGS A MONTH,
72 DOGS A YEAR...
YEAH, BUT, LORI, HERE'S --
...WE'RE LOOKING
AT $2.4 MILLION.
YEAH, HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
IT'S YOU.
IT'S SUCH A HANDS-ON
TYPE OF BUSINESS.
A WEAPON LIKE THAT
IS HIGHLY, HIGHLY TRAINED
THAT NEEDS PEOPLE LIKE YOU
TO CONSTANTLY RETUNE IT.
AND WE DO THAT.
YEAH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S --
BUT AGAIN, IT GOES TO MY POINT.
IT'S YOU.
I DON'T THINK YOU FOUND
AN INVESTOR IN ME TODAY.
PERHAPS A CUSTOMER.
I'M OUT.
IF YOU GOT THIS UP
TO $1 MILLION IN SALES,
WHICH I THINK YOU COULD...
YEAH.
...IT'S NOT REALLY INTERESTING
FOR AN INVESTOR.
WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES
TO PUT OUR CAPITAL
IN MAY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
WE LOOK FOR
UNLIMITED SCALABILITY.
I-I DON'T SEE IT HERE.
I'M OUT.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT, KEVIN.
WE REALLY NEED A PARTNER
TO HELP US HERE.
WE'RE NOT -- I JUST --
I JUST BEEN A MARINE,
A POLICE OFFICER, AND A DOG
TRAINER MY WHOLE LIFE.
I NEED SOMEBODY
WITH THAT LITTLE BIT
OF EXTRA BUSINESS SENSE
TO HELP US TAKE THIS -- THIS
BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE IT WON'T BE A $5 MILLION
OR $10 MILLION COMPANY.
MAYBE WE DO $2 MILLION.
BUT HOW --
BUT YOU MAY GET TO $2 MILLION
ON YOUR OWN,
AND THAT'S A GREAT LIVING
FOR YOU GUYS.
Cuban: THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES
OF INVESTMENTS.
FOR SOME, THEY JUST NEED
THE CASH, RIGHT?
AND FOR OTHERS,
THEY WANT CONTACTS
AND EXPERTISE AND MENTORING.
CONTACTS, EXPERTISE,
AND MENTORING IS EXPENSIVE
FROM OUR END,
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
GETTING TO $2 MILLION
RELATIVE TO OUR TIME,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE TIME
THAN THE REWARD WOULD BE,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
