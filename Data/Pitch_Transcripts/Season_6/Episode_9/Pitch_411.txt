IT'S FASTENED WITH A PRODUCT
MADE BY 3M CALLED "DUAL LOCK."
IT WOULD PROBABLY HELP
IF I SHOWED YOU A SAMPLE.
COULD YOU YOU?
YEAH. YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE
GREAT.
[ CORCORAN LAUGHS ]
WE JUST NEED A SAMPLE
TO CONNECT HERE.
I ALSO WANTED TO SHOW YOU
HOW EASY IT IS TO CUT.
YOU HAVE CUT IT?
YES.
WELL, YEAH, YOU GOT TO --
YOU GOT TO FIT THE WINDOW.
BUT IT DOESN'T COME
IN STANDARD SIZES
FOR CERTAIN SIZE WINDOWS
AND SO ON?
NO, WE HAVE
TWO SIZE PANELS.
WE HAVE A 76" BY 85",
AND WE HAVE A 65" BY 108".
AND WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER
FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
REALLY?
SINCE WE WERE KIDS,
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD
A BUSINESS TOGETHER.
WE WOULD SELL TOYS
IN THE STREET,
EVEN POPCORN
IN THE STREET.
THEN AS WE KIND OF GREW UP
INTO HIGH SCHOOL,
WE BECAME BEST FRIENDS
AND HAVE SINCE BEEN INSEPARABLE.
THAT, TO ME,
SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL, MARK.
LET'S DO IT.
Narrator:
LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO NOW.
MAKING A DEAL ON "SHARK TANK"
HAS BEEN A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.
THE LIVING CHRISTMAS COMPANY
RENTS LIVING CHRISTMAS TREES
THAT FAMILIES CAN USE
YEAR AFTER YEAR.
MY COMPANY IS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY
CONSCIOUS COMPANY --
NOT JUST TREES AND NATURE,
BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITY
AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT.
WHAT'S GOING, MAN?
HOW YOU DOING?
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?
SINCE STARTING THIS COMPANY,
HIRING VETERANS HAS BEEN
A MAJOR PART OF WHO WE ARE.
WE'RE WORKING DIRECTLY
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
TO GET EVEN MORE VETERANS
ON OUR TEAM.
OKAY, GUYS, WE HAVE 200 TREES
TO DELIVER TODAY.
CAN WE DO THAT?
All: YEAH!
WITH MARK'S INVESTMENT,
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND
THE BUSINESS DRAMATICALLY.
BEFORE, WE HAD TO SQUEEZE
OUR TREES ONTO A SMALL PROPERTY.
NOW WE HAVE A 40-ACRE LOT.
WE'VE INSTALLED
HIGH-EFFICIENCY DRIP IRRIGATION,
WHICH MEANS THAT WATER
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE TREE,
AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE WASTE.
AFTER A MAKING A DEAL WITH MARK,
I'VE GROSSED
OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
AND THIS UPCOMING HOLIDAY,
WE'RE PROJECTING SALES OF
$300,000 THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.
THIS YEAR, WE'RE EXCITED TO BE
WORKING WITH WHOLE FOODS MARKET.
WE'LL HAVE OUR TREES
IN FIVE TEST STORES
IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.
THIS IS OUR FIRST
RETAIL OPPORTUNITY,
AND IT'S HUGE FOR OUR COMPANY.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT IS
TO BE SCOTTY CLAUS.
I GET TO DO SOMETHING I LOVE,
I GET TO MAKE FAMILIES
INSANELY HAPPY,
I GET TO WORK WITH VETS
EVERY DAY.
I TRULY DO HAVE
ONE OF THE BEST JOBS IN U.S.
All: HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
ARE MOTHER-AND-SON ENTREPRENEURS
WITH A PRODUCT DESIGNED
TO GET THINGS MOVING.
FORMING A KINK.
AND WHEN WE'RE
SITTING ON THE TOILET,
THIS KINK
ONLY PARTIALLY RELAXES.
AND ONLY WHEN WE ARE
IN A SQUAT POSITION,
DOES THIS MUSCLE
COMPLETELY RELAX
AND ALLOW US TO HAVE
A COMPLETE AND FULL ELIMINATION
OF OUR WASTE.
SO, WE'VE COME UP WITH
THE PERFECT SOLUTION --
SQUATTY POTTY.
A SIMPLE STOOL
THAT'S BEEN CAREFULLY DESIGNED
THAT ALLOWS THE USER
TO SQUAT IN A HEALTHY POSITION
WHILE STILL ENJOYING
THE COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE...
[ LAUGHS ]
...OF THEIR WESTERN TOILET.
AND WHEN NOT IN USE,
IT STORES NEATLY AWAY.
SO, WITH OUR HARD WORK
AND FAMILY SPIRIT
AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERTISE,
SQUATTY POTTY WILL BE
THE GOOSE THAT LAYS
THE GOLDEN EGG
FOR YOU GUYS
AND US, TOO.
NOW, WHO WANTS TO
CLIMB ON BOARD
AND HELP US
GET AMERICA MOVING?
SQUATTY POTTY IS DESIGNED
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TASK.
IT'S PERFECTLY ANGLED,
THE PERFECT WIDTH.
IT'S LIKE CUTTING A STEAK
WITH A BUTTER KNIFE, RIGHT?
AND WE HAVE CASH
IN THE BANK.
THIS IS -- THIS IS --
WE CAN MAKE
A CRAPLOAD OF MONEY HERE
[ LAUGHTER ]
<i>AND</i> HELP PEOPLE...
POOP.
WE'RE A GOOD FAMILY
TO WORK WITH.
BUT WE FEEL LIKE
WE REALLY DO NEED A SHARK.
WE WANT SOMEBODY ON BOARD
THAT WILL ALLOW US --
IF YOUR INTERESTED,
IF YOU REALLY WANT A SHARK...
[ SIGHS ]
...THEN YOU WOULD
ENTERTAIN THAT SERIOUSLY.
WELL, UH, THE --
THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE 10%
AND THE VALUE OF THAT
IN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS.
YOU'RE TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES
OF YOUR MOUTH, RIGHT?
OKAY.
SO, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WANTING TO GET VALUE
FOR WHERE YOU SEE
THE COMPANY GOING,
AND THAT'S WHY YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH $7 MILLION.
THEN, YOU TALK ABOUT,
BOY, IF ONLY YOU HAD A SHARK
WHO COULD GET CALLS TAKEN,
WHO CAN HELP YOU GET IN RETAIL.
SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT VALUING THAT
BECAUSE IF YOU
TRULY DID VALUE THAT,
YOU WOULD NOT SAY, "LOOK,
WE'RE ALREADY TO $7 MILLION."
YOU WOULD HAVE
A VALUE ASSIGNED TO THAT
THAT COULD TAKE YOU
TO $14 MILLION OR $21 MILLION,
AND YOU WOULDN'T ARGUE
ABOUT 5%.
THAT'S THE PART
THAT DOESN'T JIVE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
THAT I'M NOT BELIEVING.
OOH.
I'M THE MOST
TRUSTWORTHY PERSON.
NO, I-I TRUST YOUR MOM.
OH, NO.
BUT YOU'RE HOPPING AND WEAVING
A LOT I FEEL,
AND IT'S MAKING ME
MORE NERVOUS AS I LISTEN.
I'M DEFINITELY OUT.
YEAH, IT DOES.
IT DOES WORK.
I KNOW
THAT THIS REALLY WORKS.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD JOB.
CONGRATS.
I'M CHEF HEIDI FROM PORTLAND,
OREGON, AND COMPANY IS HEIDI HO.
I AM SEEKING $125,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
I AM HERE BECAUSE HEIDI HO
IS THE FUTURE OF CHEESE.
LET'S BE REAL, SHARKS.
EVERYONE LOVES CHEESE!
THE TRUTH IS
CHEESE IS A PROBLEM.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT'S LOADED WITH
SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL
AND SUPER-HIGH IN SODIUM.
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN EATS
33 POUNDS OF CHEESE A YEAR.
THAT'S OVER 11 POUNDS
OF FAT.
EW.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU COULD EAT
AS MUCH CHEESE AS YOU WANT
WITHOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS?
THIS IS WHY
I CREATED HEIDI HO.
HOOOO!!
HEIDI HO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
HEIDI HO REMOVES
ALL THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED
WITH EATING CHEESE WITH A LINE
OF PLANT-BASED CHEESES
MADE ENTIRELY FROM ORGANIC NUTS,
SEEDS, VEGETABLES,
HERBS, AND SPICES.
THERE IS IN FACT
NO DAIRY IN MY CHEESES.
HOOOO!!
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU MAKE A CHEESE
WITH NO DAIRY?
I <i>DO</i> MAKE A CHEESE
WITH NO DAIRY.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
SOME SAMPLES.
WE'D LOVE TO TRY THEM.
HEIDI HO.
THANK YOU, HEIDI.
OH, WOW.
[ LAUGHS ] HEIDI HO.
MM-HMM. HA HA HA!
THIS IS REALLY GOOD, HEIDI.
WHAT'S THIS ONE?
THE ONE YOU'RE EATING, ROBERT,
IS OUR CHIA CHEESE.
MMM.
IT'S A MIXTURE
OF CHIA SEEDS, CASHEWS,
VEGETABLES,
HERBS, AND SPICES.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.
WHERE DO YOU SELL THIS?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
IN FOUR REGIONS
OF WHOLE FOODS MARKET.
STARTED IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST
AND THEN MOVED INTO
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO.
I HAVE ALREADY SECURED GROWTH
INTO FIVE MORE REGIONS
WITH THEM,
AND I NEED WORKING CAPITAL
TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE
AGAINST THAT GROWTH.
WE WILL BE IN 400 STORES
BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR.
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE REASONS
THAT CHEESES ARE SO POPULAR
IS THEY GO VERY WELL WITH WINE.
FOR EXAMPLE, A BURGUNDIAN WINE
IS OFTEN TAKEN WITH EPOISSES.
WITH WHAT? POOHS?
Greiner: YES. EPOISSES.
EPOISSES.
WHAT'S EPOISSES?
IT'S A VERY RICH,
FATTY, WONDERFUL CHEESE.
THAT DOES NOT
EMULATE CHEESE FOR ME.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT,
HEIDI?
THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT LOVE CHEESE, COVET CHEESE.
I'M A CONCESSIONER
OF THE FROMAGE.
I LOVE CHEESE, TOO,
BUT I JUST GAVE IT UP, RIGHT?
WHY?
JUST BECAUSE
OF CHOLESTEROL.
I LIKED --
I LIKED IT TOO MUCH.
WOULD YOU EAT THIS?
OH, YEAH, I LIKE IT.
I JUST ATE THE ENTIRE THING THAT
YOU GAVE ME AND MORE.
ROBERT'S GOING INTO MORE.
MARK LOVED IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, HEIDI?
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
WHOO!
BECAUSE I LOVE IT
SO MUCH.
YOU WANT $125,000.
I'LL DO IT FOR 30%.
Herjavec: WOW.
WOW.
SAY YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS AWESOME.
I'M SERIOUS. I LOVE IT.
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I MAY WANT TO WORK ON PACKAGING
AND DO THINGS TO MAKE IT --
LORI, STOP!
SHE'S GONNA SAY YES.
ABSOLUTELY!
I MEAN, I-I WANT TO HEAR
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER OFFERS.
THAT'S A MISTAKE!
NO!
THAT'S A MISTAKE!
WHAT IF
THE OFFER GOES AWAY?
JUST TO CLEAR THE DECK,
I COULD NEVER DO THIS DEAL.
I COULD LOSE MY MEMBERSHIP
IN THE CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER.
MR. WONDERFUL.
WHICH IS A WINE CLUB,
RIGHT?
SUCH --
SUCH AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
HEIDI, YOU GOT AN OFFER!
Greiner: YES!
UM...
"UH" IS
THE WRONG RESPONSE.
HEY, IF YOU WANT TO SIT
AND HEAR THE OTHER OFFERS...
OOH!
...DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
OOH!
...DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
OH, HEIDI,
YOU'RE A SMART GIRL.
THAT IS
REALLY GOOD STUFF.
BOY.
HOLY COW.
I LOVE IT.
YOU RUINED MY DIET JUST NOW,
BUT I LOVE IT.
HEY, HEIDI,
I BET YOU THAT OFFER
LOOKED <i>REALLY</i> GOOD
AT THAT POINT.
CONGRATULATIONS, HEIDI.
WE NEVER EVEN ASKED HER
WHAT IT SOLD FOR.
BARBARA, WHO CARES
ABOUT THOSE DETAILS?
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING?
IT'S HEIDI HO.
I SERIOUSLY THINK
IT IS SO DELICIOUS.
NOW YOU WATCH
"SHARK TANK."
IT JUST SENDS THE MESSAGE
THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS ALIVE AND WELL.
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I'M A PRODUCT
OF A SERIES OF MENTORS
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.
IT STARTED OUT WITH MY MOTHER.
SHE'S STILL MY MENTOR.
BUT THEN I HAD GREAT PARTNERS
AND GREAT FRIENDS,
AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE DO
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.
AND IN RETURN, IN A GREEDY WAY,
WE SUCCEED, AS WELL.
THE TWO MOST SATISFYING ACTS
IN THE UNIVERSE
IS HAVING KIDS AND RAISING THEM
AND BUILDING A BUSINESS.
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT,
IT'S THE SAME THING.
EVERY DAY,
I COME OUT HERE, HONESTLY,
I FEEL DEEPLY HUMBLED
AND HONORED --
NOT JUST TO BE WITH YOU GUYS,
BUT TO BE ON THIS SHOW.
YOU KNOW, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
STILL DON'T BELIEVE,
EVEN MY FRIENDS,
HOW REAL THE SHOW IS
UNTIL THEY COME
AND WATCH IT.
THEY STILL THINK,
"YOU MUST GET LINES,"
"IS IT REALLY
YOUR OWN MONEY?"
IT'S THE 100th EPISODE
OF "SHARK TANK."
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER 100.
YOU KNOW,
CHAMPAGNE IS A GREAT STORY.
[ CORK POPS ]
PLEASE.
OH!
WHOO!
WHOO-HOO!
THAT'S IT.
