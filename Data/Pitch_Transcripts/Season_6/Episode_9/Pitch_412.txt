HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M BOBBY EDWARDS.
THIS IS MY MOTHER JUDY,
AND WE'RE HERE SEEKING $350,000
FOR A 5% SHARE...
WHOO-HA!
HOO-HA!
...IN OUR SIMPLE PRODUCT
THAT CHANGES LIVES.
SIMPLY PUT,
WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS
TO HELP YOU
DO YOUR BUSINESS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
ARE DOING WRONG
EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIVES,
AND IT'S ADVERSELY AFFECTING
YOUR HEALTH.
OH, <i>THAT</i> BUSINESS.
[ LAUGHS ]
THE AMERICAN TOILET.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S VERY FEW PEOPLE
THAT REALIZE
THAT THE TOILET
AND THE SITTING POSITION
THAT IT PUTS YOU IN
PLAYS A BIG PART IN A LOT
OF THE COLON ISSUES THAT WE HAVE
SUCH AS CONSTIPATION.
LET ME SHOW YOU WHY.
ANATOMICALLY,
WE HAVE A MUSCLE
CALLED
THE PUBORECTALIS MUSCLE
THAT WRAPS AROUND
THE BASE OF OUR COLON,
BOBBY, BUT HOW DO YOU
SQUEEZE OUT A PROFIT?
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
SQUATTY POTTY PROFITS?
YEAH.
WELL, I WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT SALES
BECAUSE YOU VALUE THIS BUSINESS
AT $7 MILLION.
RIGHT.
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT
OF POO-POO.
WE HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS
THREE YEARS.
THE FIRST YEAR
IN BUSINESS,
WE SOLD $1 MILLION
IN SQUATTY POTTY.
COME ON!
THE YEAR AFTER THAT?
THE YEAR AFTER,
WE DID $2.7 MILLION.
YES, I LIKE IT.
AND THIS YEAR ALONE,
WE JUST SOLD $2 MILLION
IN SQUATTY POTTYS
IN THE FIRST
TWO QUARTERS, SO...
HOW DO YOU SELL THEM?
TO WHO?
THEY'RE ALL
AVAILABLE ONLINE.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
A WEBSITE AND AMAZON
THERE'S NO RETAIL?
WE'RE NOT IN RETAIL YET.
HOLY CRAP!
YOU'RE SELLING --
HOLY CRAP, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S A CRAPLOAD OF MONEY
IN SQUATTY POTTY.
NO, SERIOUSLY -- YOU'RE SELLING
$2.7 MILLION ONLINE?
Greiner:
I THINK I KNOW WHY.
O'Leary: WHY?
WEREN'T YOU JUST ON "DR. OZ"?
I JUST SAW THIS.
OKAY, SO IN THE FIRST YEAR
WE WERE IN BUSINESS IN 2012,
WE WERE ON "DR. OZ."
YES.
THAT'S HOW WE GOT
THAT $1 MILLION, RIGHT?
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT DR. OZ SAID ABOUT IT?
IT WORKS.
BECAUSE IN TWO THIRDS
OF THE WORLD, PEOPLE SQUAT.
RIGHT. YEP.
IS THERE ANYTHING
TO STOP SOMEONE ELSE
FROM DOING
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.
OKAY, SO WE HAVE
SEVERAL PATENTS.
WE HAVE A DESIGN PATENT
ON OUR ECCO,
WHICH IS
OUR NUMBER-ONE SELLER.
WE HAVE, UH, PATENT PENDINGS
ON THIS ADJUSTABLE SQUATTY,
SO AN ADJUSTABLE STOOL
THAT RAISES WITH TOILET HEIGHT.
OH.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR,
AND WHAT'S IT COST YOU TO MAKE?
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS ONE
BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONE
THAT'S ON-MARKET.
IT'S 25 BUCKS.
AND WHAT'S IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
$4.50.
Greiner: WOW.
WOW.
AND WE MAKE THEM
IN THE UNITED STATES.
GREAT MARGINS.
BUT, GUYS, LOOK --
WITH THOSE MARGINS,
YOU GOT TO BE
POOPING CASH, RIGHT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHAT DO YOU NEED
$350,000 FOR?
SO, WE HAVE
SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES.
WE CAN'T FUND THEM ALL.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THING
THAT WE WANT IS FDA COMPLIANCE
AND MEDICAL-REIMBURSEMENT
COVERAGE FOR THIS PRODUCT
AND GETTING THIS
AS A MEDICAL DEVICE.
AND THIS WHERE THIS TAKES THIS
FROM A AS-SEEN-ON-TV,
DIRECT-RESPONSE PRODUCT
TO A REAL, LEGITIMATE
MEDICAL PRODUCT.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE THIS
AS A DIRECT-RESPONSE PRODUCT?
NO. SO WE DO --
NO.
THIS IS THE OTHER ISSUE --
WHY AREN'T WE IN RETAIL?
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PUT THIS IN RETAIL.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT
TO GO INTO RETAIL
WHEN YOU'RE KILLING IT
RIGHT NOW?
WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT TO
BE IN EVERY WALGREENS AND CVS?
Herjavec:
I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES
WITH GETTING THIS
INTO RETAIL IS,
I MEAN,
DO PEOPLE FIRST LAUGH?
Corcoran:
[ Chuckling ] YEAH.
WHY CAN'T SOMEBODY
JUST GET A STACK OF BOOKS
AND LIFT THEIR LEGS UP,
I MEAN...
SO, BOBBY, LET'S SAY
I BUY INTO YOUR $7 MILLION
VISION FOR THIS YEAR IN SALES.
RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH MY MONEY?
I'M GOING TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
IMMEDIATELY.
OUR SALES ARE INCREASING
SO RAPIDLY AND --
BOBBY, DO YOU HAVE
A COUNTER FOR THAT?
YEAH, $700,000 FOR 10%.
I WOULDN'T
DO THAT DEAL, BOBBY.
OKAY.
I WOULDN'T.
I REALLY LIKE IT,
BUT TO KEVIN'S POINT, TOO,
5%, AS HE WOULD SAY,
IS A "NOTHING-BURGER."
WELL, GIVE US --
WELL, GIVE US AN OFFER, YEAH.
RIGHT.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND SO, I THINK THAT THIS
COULD DO REALLY WELL ON QVC
AND IN RETAIL,
BUT I THINK RETAILERS IS HARDER.
MM-HMM.
BUT FOR ME TO INVEST,
I FEEL LIKE I WOULD NEED
AT LEAST 10%
TO MAKE IT WORTH MY TIME,
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU $700,000.
OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO GIVE THEM?
I FEEL --
WELL, I FEEL THAT
THE $350,000 FOR 10% IS RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT
10% FOR $500,000?
OKAY, SO, YOU --
SO, BOBBY, YOUR COUNTER TO LORI
IS 10% FOR $500,000.
THAT'S MY COUNTER TO LORI.
YEAH.
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.
Bobby:
PARTNERING WITH LORI MEANS
THAT WE CAN GET THE MESSAGE OUT
THAT SQUATTING
IS HEALTHIER.
AND JUST AS PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T BE SMOKING,
THEY SHOULDN'T BE
SITTING TO POOP.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A HEALTHIER VERSION OF
ONE OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE FOODS.
HI, SHARKS.
