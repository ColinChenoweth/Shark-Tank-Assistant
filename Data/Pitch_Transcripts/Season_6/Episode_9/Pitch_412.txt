HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M BOBBY EDWARDS.
THIS IS MY MOTHER JUDY,
BOBBY, BUT HOW DO YOU
SQUEEZE OUT A PROFIT?
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
SQUATTY POTTY PROFITS?
YEAH.
WELL, I WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT SALES
BECAUSE YOU VALUE THIS BUSINESS
AT $7 MILLION.
RIGHT.
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT
OF POO-POO.
WE HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS
THREE YEARS.
THE FIRST YEAR
IN BUSINESS,
WE SOLD $1 MILLION
IN SQUATTY POTTY.
COME ON!
THE YEAR AFTER THAT?
THE YEAR AFTER,
WE DID $2.7 MILLION.
YES, I LIKE IT.
SO, BOBBY, LET'S SAY
I BUY INTO YOUR $7 MILLION
VISION FOR THIS YEAR IN SALES.
RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH MY MONEY?
I'M GOING TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
IMMEDIATELY.
BOBBY, DO YOU HAVE
A COUNTER FOR THAT?
YEAH, $700,000 FOR 10%.
I WOULDN'T
DO THAT DEAL, BOBBY.
OKAY.
I WOULDN'T.
I REALLY LIKE IT,
BUT TO KEVIN'S POINT, TOO,
5%, AS HE WOULD SAY,
IS A "NOTHING-BURGER."
WELL, GIVE US --
WELL, GIVE US AN OFFER, YEAH.
RIGHT.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, BOBBY, YOUR COUNTER TO LORI
IS 10% FOR $500,000.
THAT'S MY COUNTER TO LORI.
YEAH.
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT.
Bobby:
PARTNERING WITH LORI MEANS
THAT WE CAN GET THE MESSAGE OUT
THAT SQUATTING
IS HEALTHIER.
