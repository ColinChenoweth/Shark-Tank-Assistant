Narrator: ...AND FIGHT
EACH OTHER FOR A DEAL.
I'M GIVING YOU
YOUR FULL PRICE.
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
YEAH.
Narrator: BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING YOU'RE GONNA SAY
IS GONNA CHANGE THE OUTCOME
FOR ME ANYWAY.
WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE A MIND
READER, LET ME TELL YOU.
DANG.
THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS!
[ CORK POPS ]
OH!
WHOO!
Narrator: AND TONIGHT,
WE CELEBRATE "SHARK TANK"'S
100th EPISODE
WITH A LOOK BACK
AT THE SHARKS' FAVORITE MEMORIES
AND THEIR INSIGHT
INTO "SHARK TANK"'S IMPACT.
WE'VE ALL BEEN HERE
FOR YEARS NOW.
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?
AND THEY CAN LEAVE
YOUR HOUSE A MESS.
[ ALARM BLARES ]
[ GREINER AND CORCORAN LAUGH ]
HURRICANE O'LEARY'S
APPROACHING.
BARBARA, HELP ME
PROTECT THE HOME.
NO PROBLEM.
THIS IS FACED BY MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD
EVERY TIME
THERE'S A HURRICANE.
IT'S HEAVY, IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE,
AND IT LOOKS TERRIBLE.
[ Straining ]
ALL RIGHT. [ GRUNTS ]
COME ON, BARBARA.
THERE'S SOME
WING NUTS HERE.
THAT BOARD WOULD NOT STOP
HURRICANE O'LEARY.
YOU LINE IT UP,
AND YOU LOCK THE FIRST FASTENER.
AND THEN ALL YOU DO
IS GRAB THE MALLET.
TWO TAPS.
WOW.
Corcoran and Greiner:
WOW.
2x4 BOUNCES RIGHT OFF <i>AND</i>
PROTECTS THE GLASS BEHIND IT.
THAT'S AMAZING.
WOW.
YEAH, IT IS AMAZING.
BUT IT DOESN'T COME
IN STANDARD SIZES
FOR CERTAIN SIZE WINDOWS
AND SO ON?
NO, WE HAVE
TWO SIZE PANELS.
WE HAVE A 76" BY 85",
AND WE HAVE A 65" BY 108".
USE THE HANDLE AS ONE, BUT
OTHER WAY I HAVE TO SHOW YOU --
EVERYONE ELSE
BOLTS THEIR PRODUCT ON,
SO IF THERE'S A FIRE,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
WHERE DID HE GO?
[ GASPS ]
PUSH HARD, AND REMOVE IT.
NOW, WE SELL STORM STOPPERS
AS A KIT.
IT'S A PANEL,
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FASTENERS.
TO MAKE THIS A STANDARD
INSTEAD PLYWOOD,
WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR DECADES.
SO, WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING
BECAUSE FOR $1 MILLION,
I WANT KNOW THAT THIS THING'S
WORKING OUT IN THE MARKET.
SO, THIS IS
MY 10th YEAR IN BUSINESS.
WE'VE DONE A LITTLE OVER
$5? MILLION IN SALES
TO 5,500 CUSTOMERS.
'05 AND '06,
WE DID $1.6 MILLION.
WHAT ABOUT
THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
LAST 12 MONTHS,
I'VE DONE $200,000.
MM.
WAIT, WAIT.
SO YOU'VE SEEN
A DROP-OFF?
WELL, OUR PRODUCT IS TIED
TO THE ECONOMY AND THE WEATHER.
IT'S LIKE SELLING UMBRELLAS.
YOU GOT TO HAVE RAIN
TO SELL AN UMBRELLA.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A FEAR.
ABSOLUTELY. AND OUR CUSTOMERS
BELIEVE IN IT, TOO.
BUT, NO, NO,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS.
I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING YOU'RE GONNA SAY
IS GONNA CHANGE THE OUTCOME
FOR ME, ANYWAY.
WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE
A MIND READER, LET ME TELL YOU.
WHOA.
DANG. THAT'S NOT
THE WAY TO SELL.
ALL RIGHT,
THE SALES ARE HORRIFIC.
SO, LOOK, YOU SHOWED ME
A REALLY INTERESTING TECHNOLOGY
THAT WORKS,
BUT NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT.
I'M OUT.
SO YOU HAVE TO STOCK UP
AND LAY OUT A LOT OF CASH,
HOPING YOU'RE GONNA GET
A HURRICANE SOON.
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF CASH OUTLAY
AND NOT KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT.
SO, IT'S A ROUGH BUSINESS,
SO I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
MARK?
IN RESIDENTIAL-HURRICANE
SAFETY AND PROTECTION,
BUT YOUR INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
AND YOUR SALE SKILLS ARE AWFUL.
IF YOU CHALLENGE KEVIN
WHEN BASICALLY
YOUR BUSINESS LIFE
IS ON THE LINE,
AND YOU'RE ASKING HIM
IF HE'S A MIND READER,
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHEN
YOU GET FLUSTERED IN A SITUATION
WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL
A HOMEOWNER OR A BUILDER.
I DON'T TRUST YOU
IN TERMS OF YOUR SALES ABILITY.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, LORI?
Greiner:
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU --
I THINK THAT IT'S
A REALLY SMART PRODUCT.
THANK YOU.
BUT, FOR ME,
I'M VERY CONCERNED
I'M JEN.
AND I'M JEFF.
AND WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER
FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
REALLY?
SINCE WE WERE KIDS,
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD
A BUSINESS TOGETHER.
WE WOULD SELL TOYS
IN THE STREET,
EVEN POPCORN
IN THE STREET.
THEN AS WE KIND OF GREW UP
INTO HIGH SCHOOL,
WE BECAME BEST FRIENDS
AND HAVE SINCE BEEN INSEPARABLE.
JEFF, TRY THIS.
ONE DAY, JEFF WAS HELPING ME
MOVE APARTMENTS,
AND WE HAD NOTHING TO EAT
BUT WERE STARVING.
SO, I HAD A FEW INGREDIENTS
FROM A HEALTH-FOODS STORE.
WE STARTED MAKING IT,
AND IT WAS AMAZING.
BUT WE'VE MANAGED TO MAKE IT NEW
AND EXCITING AGAIN.
IT'S HEALTHY, GLUTEN-FREE,
VEGAN, AND COMPLETELY DELICIOUS.
STARTING A BUSINESS IN NEW YORK
ISN'T ALWAYS THE EASIEST.
WE'RE WORKING FULL-TIME AT
IT AND BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET.
Jeff: WE NEED
AN INVESTMENT FROM A SHARK
TO REALLY GET TO
THE NEXT LEVEL.
WE HAVE A GREAT PRODUCT.
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
THE MANUFACTURING
OR THE DISTRIBUTION
TO GET IT OUT THERE.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE'VE TAKEN
OUR LITTLE FAMILY COMPANY
AS FAR AS WE CAN
ON OUR OWN,
AND WE'VE LITERALLY GIVEN UP
EVERYTHING TO TAKE IT THIS FAR.
WE JUST REALLY HOPE
THAT ONE OF THE SHARKS LOVES IT
AS MUCH AS WE DO
BECAUSE IT'S EVERYTHING TO US.
HI, SHARKS, I'M JEN,
AND THIS MY BIG BROTHER, JEFF.
WE'RE FROM
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK,
AND WE'RE ASKING
FOR $200,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY,
PIPSNACKS.
JEN AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
ENTREPRENEURS.
AS KIDS,
INSTEAD OF LEMONADE,
WE WOULD SELL POPCORN
OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.
FAST-FORWARD 20 YEARS,
AND WE'RE ALL STILL MUNCHING ON
THAT SAME POPCORN UNTIL NOW.
I WAS WORKING AT
A HEALTH-FOODS STORE,
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT POPCORN COULD GET BETTER,
BUT A FARMER INTRODUCED ME
TO THIS SPECIAL VARIETY OF CORN.
I TOOK IT HOME
AND POPPED IT,
AND NOT LONG AFTER,
PIPCORN WAS BORN.
PIPCORN'S DELICIOUS,
ALL-NATURAL,
AND YOU GUESS IT -- MINI.
Greiner: OH!
[ LAUGHS ]
EVEN BETTER,
THE SHELLS ARE
MUCH, MUCH, MUCH SMALLER
AND MORE DELICATE.
SO, SAY GOODBYE
TO THOSE THICK, HARD PIECES
THAT GET STUCK
IN YOUR TEETH.
NOW, BEFORE WE GET
TOO FAR ALONG,
LET'S GET TO THE REAL BUSINESS
AND HAND SOME OUT.
AND AS WE ALWAYS SAY...
Both: PIP-PIP HOORAY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, SHARKS, OUR FLAVORS ARE
SEA SALT, ROSEMARY...
YES.
Herjavec: SEA SALT.
...KETTLE, AND EVERYONE'S
FAVORITE -- WHITE TRUFFLE.
SO, THE TRUFFLE'S ALL-NATURAL
TRUFFLE, THE REAL STUFF.
Jen: HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
THE ROSEMARY -- WE MAKE
ALL OF OUR ROSEMARY SEA SALT.
IT'S REALLY GREAT.
EVERYTHING'S VEGAN AND
GLUTEN-FREE, ORGANIC, NON-GMO.
REALLY?
YEAH.
AND WE POP IT
IN OLIVE OIL.
CAN I GO TO THE FARMER MYSELF
AND BUY MY OWN KERNELS FROM HIM?
WHAT DO I NEED YOU FOR?
YOU CAN, BUT WE'RE
ACTUALLY GROWING SO QUICKLY
THAT WE'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO SIGNING
A TOTAL-EXCLUSIVE
FOR POPPING.
SO, WE'VE ACTUALLY GROWN 125%
IN SALES SINCE JANUARY.
IS HE THE ONLY FARMER THAT CAN
GROW THIS SMALL POPCORN?
NO, HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE,
BUT WE HAVE ABOUT TWO AND HALF
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.
WE HAVE TWO AND A HALF YEARS
OF KIND OF LEEWAY,
BUILDING A BRAND,
BUILDING A PRODUCT.
RIGHT, SO,
TELL US ABOUT THE REVENUE.
TELL US ABOUT WHERE YOU SELL.
WE LAUNCHED IN APRIL OF 2012,
AND ONE MONTH INTO THE JOB,
WE CAUGHT
THE ATTENTION OF OPRAH.
WE WERE FEATURED ON HER
"FAVORITE THINGS" IN NOVEMBER.
WOW.
SO WE WERE FORCED
TO REALLY SCALE-UP VERY QUICKLY,
BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING
WITH A CO-PACKER
TO OUTSOURCE
99% OF IT,
AND THAT WILL DOUBLE
OUR MARGINS.
WHAT WILL IT COST YOU AFTER
YOU'VE SCALE WITH THE CO-PACKER?
AROUND 92 CENTS,
AVERAGE.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE
BETWEEN THIS BAG
AND A TRADITIONAL POPCORN BAG
BESIDE IT?
IT DEPENDS ON
WHERE YOU'RE BUYING.
IF YOU'RE BUYING STORE BRAND,
IT'S A $1.99.
THIS IS $5,
AND THAT STUFF IS $2.
Herjavec:
SO, JEFF, I LOVE POPCORN.
BESIDES NOT GETTING
STUCK IN YOUR TEETH,
TELL THE VALUE-ADD
OF SMALL POPCORN.
JEN CAN'T EAT POPCORN.
IT KILLS HER STOMACH.
SHE ACTUALLY HAS
A COUPLE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.
PREVENTS HER
FROM EATING A LOT OF THINGS.
SHE FOUND THIS KERNEL
WORKING AT A HEALTH-FOODS STORE,
AND SHE COULD EAT.
IT'S WAY EASIER TO DIGEST.
IT'S SMALLER, IT'S CUTE,
IT'S ALSO --
THERE ARE SOME HEALTH BENEFITS.
IT'S MUCH HIGHER IN FIBER
THAN ORDINARY POPCORN.
HOW DO WE MAKE MONEY IS WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE YOU --
SO, ONCE WE GO TO
THE CO-PACKER --
YOU SAID
$200,000 FOR 10%, RIGHT?
YEAH, $2 MILLION VALUE.
THAT'S AN ACCUMULATED VALUE
OF $2 MILLION...
CORRECT.
...AND IT'S POPCORN.
CORRECT.
HOW DO I GET MY $200,000 BACK
IF I'M A 10% SHAREHOLDER?
SO, YEAR TO DATE,
WE'VE DONE $150,000 IN SALES.
WE'RE GROWING --
SINCE JANUARY, WE GROWN 124%.
YOU'VE MADE NO MONEY,
RIGHT?
NOT CURRENTLY,
BUT BY THE END OF THE YEAR,
WE'RE PROJECTED
TO MAKE $40,000.
ISN'T AMAZING I KNOW THAT?
WHY DO I KNOW THAT?
BECAUSE WE'RE
A SMALL MANUFACTURER,
AND -- AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
IN THE BEGINNING.
BUT YOU THINK THIS IS --
IDEA IS WORTH $2 MILLION?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
WELL --
OKAY, EXPLAIN WHY.
WE'RE GONNA
FINISH THE YEAR
AT JUST AROUND $440,000
IN SALES,
AND THAT'S IN 65 STORES.
AS SOON AS WE GET
A CO-PACKER --
CUT OUR COSTS
ALMOST MORE THAN HALF --
THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO
REALLY PUSH IT OUT, MAKE MONEY,
AND THEN WE CAN GO TO THE ENTIRE
REGION OF WHOLE FOODS.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE --
AND I LOOK AT YOU, AND I SAY,
"IF I HAD $2 MILLION --
"A BAG WITH $2 MILLION IN IT
RIGHT HERE --
"COULD I FIND
A SISTER AND A BROTHER
WHO WOULD COME
AND WORK FOR ME?"
NOW, IF WE LISTENED TO
EVERYONE THAT SAID THAT TO US...
RIGHT.
...WE WOULDN'T BE HERE,
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
AMEN TO THAT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
AND -- AND --
SO, IGNORE HIM.
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW RIGHT
NOW THAT I'M PERSON
THAT'S WILLING
OR THE ONLY SHARK --
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
"MR. WONDERFUL" --
THAT TELLS THE TRUTH.
HA!
YOU WILL NOT GET
$200,000 FOR 10%.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT
RIGHT NOW.
OKAY. OKAY.
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY.
YOU'RE NOT WORTH
2 MILLION BUCKS.
ARE YOU TAKING A SALARY
FROM THE BUSINESS?
NO.
NEVER.
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY TODAY
IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING MONEY
OUT OF THE BUSINESS?
LIKE, HOW DO YOU SURVIVE?
PERSONALLY.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN'T EAT
THAT MUCH POPCORN.
WE EAT A LOT OF POPCORN.
WE EAT A LOT OF POPCORN.
I LIVED IN MY FRIEND'S CLOSET
FOR A LONG TIME.
YEAH.
WE JUST WORK ALL THE --
CLOSET?
AND WE KNOW,
LIKE, TO YOUR POINT,
WE KNOW THAT IT IS
WORTH THAT.
WE KNOW THAT IT IS,
AND I'M SURE YOU HEAR THAT
ALL THE TIME, BUT --
TO MY POINT,
I KNOW IT ISN'T.
I THINK IT IS.
NO, IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
AH. I'M OUT.
Herjavec:
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL.
I LOVE THE BELIEF,
<i>LOVE</i> THE POPCORN.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANKS.
REALLY LOVE THE NAME.
BUT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE VALUATION?
$200,000 FOR 20% --
THAT'S MY OFFER.
CUT IT IN HALF.
HE JUST CUT IT IN HALF.
AND BY THE WAY,
HE'S OVERVALUING THE BUSINESS.
IT'S A LITTLE LOW FOR US
TO BE HONEST.
IS THERE A NUMBER THAT YOU
WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH?
$200,000 FOR 10%.
THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU CAME IN
ASKING FOR!
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S MY COUNTER.
THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS!
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
I MEAN,
WE THINK IT'S LOW.
ARE YOU SAYING "NO"
TO THAT OFFER?
BECAUSE, JUST TO BE CLEAR,
IT'S POPCORN.
I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH
HIS VALUATION FOR THE BUSINESS.
I REALLY DO.
I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACHING.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS ARE WINNERS.
I CAN SMELL IT A MILE AWAY.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, YEAH.
WHAT IS THE OFFER?
I'M YOU YOUR FULL PRICE.
WHAT?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
Herjavec: $200,000 FOR 10%?
YEAH, THERE'S ONLY
ONE CONTINGENCY.
YOU TAKE OUT $900
ON A GIVEN WEEK, OKAY?
I GET 10%.
$200,000 FOR 10%.
AND YOU GET DRAW
AS WE GO.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
I GET MY MONEY BACK OUT,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I CAN'T FEEL LIKE A FOOL
WORKING MY BUNS OFF FOR YOU
WITH NO COMPENSATION.
RIGHT.
WELL, YOU WON'T
FEEL LIKE A FOOL.
YEAH.
I PROMISE YOU THAT.
COULD WE START THAT DEAL
IN YEAR 1
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE CASH OUT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT
TAKING CASH OUT ANYWAY.
SO YOU DON'T TAKE CASH,
I DON'T TAKE CASH.
YOU KNOW,
I THINK I'M IN A BAD DREAM.
WHENEVER YOU TAKE MONEY OUT,
I START TAKING MONEY OUT.
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING WITH HER,
AND SHE OFFERED YOU
$2 MILLION FOR <i>THIS?</i>
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WELL, SHE'S ASKING, THOUGH,
FOR MONEY BACK EVERY TIME.
BUT I LIKE TO PUT
ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE.
OH, THAT'S AWFUL!
THAT'S HORRIBLE!
THAT --
WHAT'S HORRIBLE?
SHE WANTS HER MONEY BACK?
OKAY, THIS --
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
YOU'RE OVERVALUING THE COMPANY,
BUT, YOU GUYS,
IT IS SO CLEAR
THAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS
A MASSIVE HOME RUN.
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
WE GET PEOPLE IN THE SHARK TANK
THAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN.
YOU GUYS GONNA KILL IT!
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA KILL IT.
THANK YOU.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED THE 100 BUCKS
A WEEK, LIKE BARBARA.
I'M DOING OKAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $200,000 FOR 10%.
WOW.
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.
BARBARA AND ROBERT HAVE OFFERED
JEFF AND JENNIFER
THE AMOUNT THEY WERE SEEKING --
$200,000 FOR 10%
OF THEIR MINI-POPCORN COMPANY,
PIPSNACKS.
HOWEVER, BARBARA WANTS
10% OF ANY DISTRIBUTIONS
THAT THEY TAKE OUT
OF THE COMPANY.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
ONE THAT'S TAKING MONEY BACK
EACH TIME YOU TAKE MONEY,
AND ONE THAT ISN'T.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WELL -- WELL,
LET ME SUGGEST SOMETHING.
CAN YOU MATCH
ROBERT'S OFFER?
HIS OFFER -- NO.
THE BOTH OF YOU,
YOU'RE IDIOTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T START.
Greiner: HELP!
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE --
JUST SAY YES OR NO.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
[ CHUCKLING ]
YOU SAY IT.
BARBARA, WE'D LOVE
TO WORK WITH YOU.
SMART PEOPLE.
WE CAME IN HERE,
WE LOVE YOU, ROBERT.
I'M SORRY. WE REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BRING IT IN.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE HIM.
WE ALREADY DO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[ LAUGHS ]
WOW.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
WE'VE SEEN BARBARA DO
A TON OF FOOD, VERY HIGH-LEVEL.
WE TARGETED BARBARA
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
AND WE'RE SO HAPPY
SHE LIKE IT.
YEAH.
BARBARA, THIS IS GONNA BE
A HEARTBREAK FOR YOU.
NOT AT ALL.
EVERY TIME I EAT POPCORN NOW,
I'M GONNA CRY FOR BARBARA.
I'M GONNA --
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
BARBARA'S NOT SHARING.
OHH!!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH!
YOU KNEW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
Narrator:
IN SEASON 4, SCOTT MARTIN
MADE A DEAL WITH MARK CUBAN
FOR HIS LIVE CHRISTMAS TREE
RENTAL SERVICE,
THE LIVING CHRISTMAS COMPANY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $150,000,
AND I'LL TAKE 40%.
NOT JUST TREES AND NATURE,
BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITY
AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT.
WHAT'S GOING, MAN?
HOW YOU DOING?
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?
SINCE STARTING THIS COMPANY,
HIRING VETERANS HAS BEEN
A MAJOR PART OF WHO WE ARE.
WE'RE WORKING DIRECTLY
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
TO GET EVEN MORE VETERANS
ON OUR TEAM.
OKAY, GUYS, WE HAVE 200 TREES
TO DELIVER TODAY.
CAN WE DO THAT?
All: YEAH!
WITH MARK'S INVESTMENT,
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND
THE BUSINESS DRAMATICALLY.
BEFORE, WE HAD TO SQUEEZE
OUR TREES ONTO A SMALL PROPERTY.
NOW WE HAVE A 40-ACRE LOT.
WE'VE INSTALLED
HIGH-EFFICIENCY DRIP IRRIGATION,
WHICH MEANS THAT WATER
GOES DIRECTLY TO THE TREE,
AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE WASTE.
AFTER A MAKING A DEAL WITH MARK,
I'VE GROSSED
OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
AND THIS UPCOMING HOLIDAY,
WE'RE PROJECTING SALES OF
$300,000 THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.
THIS YEAR, WE'RE EXCITED TO BE
WORKING WITH WHOLE FOODS MARKET.
WE'LL HAVE OUR TREES
IN FIVE TEST STORES
IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.
THIS IS OUR FIRST
RETAIL OPPORTUNITY,
AND IT'S HUGE FOR OUR COMPANY.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT IS
TO BE SCOTTY CLAUS.
I GET TO DO SOMETHING I LOVE,
I GET TO MAKE FAMILIES
INSANELY HAPPY,
I GET TO WORK WITH VETS
EVERY DAY.
I TRULY DO HAVE
ONE OF THE BEST JOBS IN U.S.
All: HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
ARE MOTHER-AND-SON ENTREPRENEURS
WITH A PRODUCT DESIGNED
TO GET THINGS MOVING.
AND WE'RE HERE SEEKING $350,000
FOR A 5% SHARE...
WHOO-HA!
HOO-HA!
...IN OUR SIMPLE PRODUCT
THAT CHANGES LIVES.
SIMPLY PUT,
WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS
TO HELP YOU
DO YOUR BUSINESS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
ARE DOING WRONG
EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIVES,
AND IT'S ADVERSELY AFFECTING
YOUR HEALTH.
OH, <i>THAT</i> BUSINESS.
[ LAUGHS ]
THE AMERICAN TOILET.
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S VERY FEW PEOPLE
THAT REALIZE
THAT THE TOILET
AND THE SITTING POSITION
THAT IT PUTS YOU IN
PLAYS A BIG PART IN A LOT
OF THE COLON ISSUES THAT WE HAVE
SUCH AS CONSTIPATION.
LET ME SHOW YOU WHY.
ANATOMICALLY,
WE HAVE A MUSCLE
CALLED
THE PUBORECTALIS MUSCLE
THAT WRAPS AROUND
THE BASE OF OUR COLON,
AND WHEN WE'RE
SITTING ON THE TOILET,
THIS KINK
ONLY PARTIALLY RELAXES.
AND ONLY WHEN WE ARE
IN A SQUAT POSITION,
DOES THIS MUSCLE
COMPLETELY RELAX
AND ALLOW US TO HAVE
A COMPLETE AND FULL ELIMINATION
OF OUR WASTE.
SO, WE'VE COME UP WITH
THE PERFECT SOLUTION --
SQUATTY POTTY.
A SIMPLE STOOL
THAT'S BEEN CAREFULLY DESIGNED
THAT ALLOWS THE USER
TO SQUAT IN A HEALTHY POSITION
WHILE STILL ENJOYING
THE COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE...
[ LAUGHS ]
...OF THEIR WESTERN TOILET.
AND WHEN NOT IN USE,
IT STORES NEATLY AWAY.
SO, WITH OUR HARD WORK
AND FAMILY SPIRIT
AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE
AND EXPERTISE,
SQUATTY POTTY WILL BE
THE GOOSE THAT LAYS
THE GOLDEN EGG
FOR YOU GUYS
AND US, TOO.
NOW, WHO WANTS TO
CLIMB ON BOARD
AND HELP US
GET AMERICA MOVING?
AND THIS YEAR ALONE,
WE JUST SOLD $2 MILLION
IN SQUATTY POTTYS
IN THE FIRST
TWO QUARTERS, SO...
HOW DO YOU SELL THEM?
TO WHO?
THEY'RE ALL
AVAILABLE ONLINE.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
A WEBSITE AND AMAZON
THERE'S NO RETAIL?
WE'RE NOT IN RETAIL YET.
HOLY CRAP!
YOU'RE SELLING --
HOLY CRAP, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S A CRAPLOAD OF MONEY
IN SQUATTY POTTY.
NO, SERIOUSLY -- YOU'RE SELLING
$2.7 MILLION ONLINE?
Greiner:
I THINK I KNOW WHY.
O'Leary: WHY?
WEREN'T YOU JUST ON "DR. OZ"?
I JUST SAW THIS.
OKAY, SO IN THE FIRST YEAR
WE WERE IN BUSINESS IN 2012,
WE WERE ON "DR. OZ."
YES.
THAT'S HOW WE GOT
THAT $1 MILLION, RIGHT?
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT DR. OZ SAID ABOUT IT?
IT WORKS.
BECAUSE IN TWO THIRDS
OF THE WORLD, PEOPLE SQUAT.
RIGHT. YEP.
IS THERE ANYTHING
TO STOP SOMEONE ELSE
FROM DOING
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.
OKAY, SO WE HAVE
SEVERAL PATENTS.
WE HAVE A DESIGN PATENT
ON OUR ECCO,
WHICH IS
OUR NUMBER-ONE SELLER.
WE HAVE, UH, PATENT PENDINGS
ON THIS ADJUSTABLE SQUATTY,
SO AN ADJUSTABLE STOOL
THAT RAISES WITH TOILET HEIGHT.
OH.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR,
AND WHAT'S IT COST YOU TO MAKE?
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS ONE
BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONE
THAT'S ON-MARKET.
IT'S 25 BUCKS.
AND WHAT'S IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
$4.50.
Greiner: WOW.
WOW.
AND WE MAKE THEM
IN THE UNITED STATES.
GREAT MARGINS.
BUT, GUYS, LOOK --
WITH THOSE MARGINS,
YOU GOT TO BE
POOPING CASH, RIGHT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHAT DO YOU NEED
$350,000 FOR?
SO, WE HAVE
SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES.
WE CAN'T FUND THEM ALL.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THING
THAT WE WANT IS FDA COMPLIANCE
AND MEDICAL-REIMBURSEMENT
COVERAGE FOR THIS PRODUCT
AND GETTING THIS
AS A MEDICAL DEVICE.
AND THIS WHERE THIS TAKES THIS
FROM A AS-SEEN-ON-TV,
DIRECT-RESPONSE PRODUCT
TO A REAL, LEGITIMATE
MEDICAL PRODUCT.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE THIS
AS A DIRECT-RESPONSE PRODUCT?
NO. SO WE DO --
NO.
THIS IS THE OTHER ISSUE --
WHY AREN'T WE IN RETAIL?
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PUT THIS IN RETAIL.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT
TO GO INTO RETAIL
WHEN YOU'RE KILLING IT
RIGHT NOW?
WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT TO
BE IN EVERY WALGREENS AND CVS?
Herjavec:
I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES
WITH GETTING THIS
INTO RETAIL IS,
I MEAN,
DO PEOPLE FIRST LAUGH?
Corcoran:
[ Chuckling ] YEAH.
WHY CAN'T SOMEBODY
JUST GET A STACK OF BOOKS
AND LIFT THEIR LEGS UP,
I MEAN...
AND ED--
IT'S AN EDUCATION THING.
OKAY, SO WHAT'S --
WHAT'S YOUR COST PER
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION RIGHT NOW?
WELL, THE --
HOW MUCH ARE YOU SPENDING
ON ADVERTISING AND MARKETING?
FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS,
WE'VE BEEN ADVERTISING
ON HOWARD STERN.
FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND,
WE GET $5 -- $4 TO $5 IN SALES.
OUR SALES ARE INCREASING
SO RAPIDLY AND --
AND WE HAVE CASH
IN THE BANK.
THIS IS -- THIS IS --
WE CAN MAKE
A CRAPLOAD OF MONEY HERE
[ LAUGHTER ]
<i>AND</i> HELP PEOPLE...
POOP.
WE'RE A GOOD FAMILY
TO WORK WITH.
AND SO, I THINK THAT THIS
COULD DO REALLY WELL ON QVC
AND IN RETAIL,
BUT I THINK RETAILERS IS HARDER.
MM-HMM.
BUT FOR ME TO INVEST,
I FEEL LIKE I WOULD NEED
AT LEAST 10%
TO MAKE IT WORTH MY TIME,
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU $700,000.
OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO GIVE THEM?
I FEEL --
WELL, I FEEL THAT
THE $350,000 FOR 10% IS RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT
10% FOR $500,000?
OKAY, SO, YOU --
AND THE VALUE OF THAT
IN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS.
YOU'RE TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES
OF YOUR MOUTH, RIGHT?
OKAY.
SO, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WANTING TO GET VALUE
FOR WHERE YOU SEE
THE COMPANY GOING,
AND THAT'S WHY YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH $7 MILLION.
THEN, YOU TALK ABOUT,
BOY, IF ONLY YOU HAD A SHARK
WHO COULD GET CALLS TAKEN,
WHO CAN HELP YOU GET IN RETAIL.
SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT VALUING THAT
BECAUSE IF YOU
TRULY DID VALUE THAT,
YOU WOULD NOT SAY, "LOOK,
WE'RE ALREADY TO $7 MILLION."
YOU WOULD HAVE
A VALUE ASSIGNED TO THAT
THAT COULD TAKE YOU
TO $14 MILLION OR $21 MILLION,
AND YOU WOULDN'T ARGUE
ABOUT 5%.
THAT'S THE PART
THAT DOESN'T JIVE.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
THAT I'M NOT BELIEVING.
OOH.
I'M THE MOST
TRUSTWORTHY PERSON.
NO, I-I TRUST YOUR MOM.
OH, NO.
BUT YOU'RE HOPPING AND WEAVING
A LOT I FEEL,
AND IT'S MAKING ME
MORE NERVOUS AS I LISTEN.
I'M DEFINITELY OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M JUST GOING BACK AND FORTH.
I'M NOT DOING IT FOR
LESS THAN 10% AND NEVER WOULD I.
ACTUALLY, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE LORI'S OFFER.
Cuban: THERE YOU GO.
[ HERJAVEC CHUCKLES ]
Greiner: GREAT.
I THINK -- I KNOW
THAT IT HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I DO KNOW THAT.
AND JUST AS PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T BE SMOKING,
THEY SHOULDN'T BE
SITTING TO POOP.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A HEALTHIER VERSION OF
ONE OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE FOODS.
HI, SHARKS.
I'M CHEF HEIDI FROM PORTLAND,
OREGON, AND COMPANY IS HEIDI HO.
I AM SEEKING $125,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
IT'S LOADED WITH
SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL
AND SUPER-HIGH IN SODIUM.
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN EATS
33 POUNDS OF CHEESE A YEAR.
THAT'S OVER 11 POUNDS
OF FAT.
EW.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU COULD EAT
AS MUCH CHEESE AS YOU WANT
WITHOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS?
HERBS, AND SPICES.
THERE IS IN FACT
NO DAIRY IN MY CHEESES.
HOOOO!!
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU MAKE A CHEESE
WITH NO DAIRY?
I <i>DO</i> MAKE A CHEESE
WITH NO DAIRY.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
SOME SAMPLES.
WE'D LOVE TO TRY THEM.
VEGETABLES,
HERBS, AND SPICES.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.
WHERE DO YOU SELL THIS?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
IN FOUR REGIONS
OF WHOLE FOODS MARKET.
STARTED IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST
AND THEN MOVED INTO
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO.
I HAVE ALREADY SECURED GROWTH
INTO FIVE MORE REGIONS
WITH THEM,
AND I NEED WORKING CAPITAL
TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE
AGAINST THAT GROWTH.
WE WILL BE IN 400 STORES
BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR.
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE REASONS
THAT CHEESES ARE SO POPULAR
IS THEY GO VERY WELL WITH WINE.
FOR EXAMPLE, A BURGUNDIAN WINE
IS OFTEN TAKEN WITH EPOISSES.
WITH WHAT? POOHS?
Greiner: YES. EPOISSES.
EPOISSES.
WHAT'S EPOISSES?
IT'S A VERY RICH,
FATTY, WONDERFUL CHEESE.
THAT DOES NOT
EMULATE CHEESE FOR ME.
AND I WANTED
TO COME TO THE SHARK TANK
BECAUSE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME
GROWING A BUSINESS,
AND I NEED SOME SUPPORT.
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME HOW
YOU CAME UP WITH THE WHOLE IDEA.
ABSOLUTELY.
I GREW UP ON A VERY TRADITIONAL
AMERICAN DIET.
BY THE TIME
THAT I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL,
AND I KNEW
THAT THERE WAS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY DIET,
THAT THE BULLYING AND THE
RIDICULE THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED
GROWING UP WAS NOT FAIR
BASED ON THINGS THAT I DIDN'T
EVEN REALLY REALIZE
WERE THE REASON
WHY I HAD GAINED SO MUCH WEIGHT.
SO, REALLY,
I WAS INSPIRED TO COOK,
LEARN ABOUT NUTRITION,
TOOK ON A PLANT-BASED DIET,
AND REALLY STARTED TO SEE
THOSE POUNDS COME OFF,
AND MY LIFE HAS COMPLETELY
CHANGED FROM THAT.
NOW, DO YOU THINK
THAT ONLY VEGAN
OR PLANT-BASED-DIET PEOPLE
WILL EAT THIS?
NO, THIS IS
A HUGE CROSSOVER.
I JUST ATE THE ENTIRE THING THAT
YOU GAVE ME AND MORE.
ROBERT'S GOING INTO MORE.
MARK LOVED IT.
I MAY WANT TO WORK ON PACKAGING
AND DO THINGS TO MAKE IT --
LORI, STOP!
SHE'S GONNA SAY YES.
ABSOLUTELY!
I MEAN, I-I WANT TO HEAR
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER OFFERS.
THAT'S A MISTAKE!
NO!
THAT'S A MISTAKE!
WHAT IF
THE OFFER GOES AWAY?
JUST TO CLEAR THE DECK,
I COULD NEVER DO THIS DEAL.
I COULD LOSE MY MEMBERSHIP
IN THE CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER.
MR. WONDERFUL.
WHICH IS A WINE CLUB,
RIGHT?
SUCH --
SUCH AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
HEY, IF YOU WANT TO SIT
AND HEAR THE OTHER OFFERS...
IF YOU WANT TO SIT
AND HEAR THE OTHER OFFERS...
AND IT CAME OUT IN THE BAG.
JUST IMAGINE FOR A MINUTE
YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET
WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL,
LITTLE CHILD HERE.
THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE...
[ ALL GROANING ]
OH, GOD!
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE WAKE 'N' BACON?
THE WORLD'S FIRST ALARM CLOCK
THAT ACTUALLY WAKES YOU UP
WITH BACON.
[ LAUGHS ]
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
IT HEATS UP THE BACON.
YOU CAN THEN ACTUALLY
JUST ROLL OVER IN BED
AND EAT THE BACON YOURSELF.
YOU CAN COOK THE BACON
AND THEN EAT IT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
SHUT UP!
I'M SERIOUS.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW, THE ONES
WHO I'LL REMEMBER
ARE THE GREAT CHARACTERS.
? AND I WANT TO DRAW
A CAT FOR YOU ?
? BREAD IT, MIX IT,
SHAKE IT, STIR IT ?
? BREAD IT, MIX IT,
SHAKE IT, STIR IT ?
NOW THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!
OY VEY.
OY VEY BIG-TIME.
TECHNOLOGY HARNESSES
THE SPIN OF THE EARTH.
THE WATER VAPOR IS DELIVERED
TO A VORTEX CHAMBER.
100 EPISODES AND

I SMELL A ROYALTY DEAL.

Krause:

MY NAME IS NOAH. I AM THE C.E.O.
OF PAPERBOX PILOTS.
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE SHARK
BY THE WAY?
I LIKE ALL OF YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AND SAY,
"MY 7-YEAR-OLD,
MY 9-YEAR-OLD LOVE THE SHOW,"
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT IT.
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
IN A SMALL WAY,
WE'RE A SPARK
TO THOSE PEOPLE.
BY THE WAY, BARBARA,
I HAVE TO THANK YOU.
HERE IT COMES.
I'M GOING DOWN THE ESCALATOR
AT L.A.X.,
AND THERE'S
A GUY HOLDING A SIGN.
IT'S NOT MY NAME,
IT SAYS "MR. WONDERFUL."
AND I THINK BACK TO SEASON 1
WHEN YOU GAVE ME THAT NAME,
AND I'M SO PROUD
TO WEAR IT NOW WITH HONOR.
I HAVE NEVER CALLED YOU
"MR. WONDERFUL."
Cuban: BARBARA,
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
STOP SPREADING THAT RUMOR.
I WOULDN'T THROW OUT THE 70%.
THAT LEAVES YOU WITH 30%
'CAUSE YOU GET TO WORK
WITH MR. WONDERFUL -- THAT'S ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY, WE'LL BEEN HERE
FOR YEARS NOW.
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?
THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
IS ALIVE AND WELL.
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I'M A PRODUCT
OF A SERIES OF MENTORS
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.
IT STARTED OUT WITH MY MOTHER.
SHE'S STILL MY MENTOR.
BUT THEN I HAD GREAT PARTNERS
AND GREAT FRIENDS,
AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE DO
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.
AND IN RETURN, IN A GREEDY WAY,
WE SUCCEED, AS WELL.
THE TWO MOST SATISFYING ACTS
IN THE UNIVERSE
IS HAVING KIDS AND RAISING THEM
AND BUILDING A BUSINESS.
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT,
IT'S THE SAME THING.
EVERY DAY,
I COME OUT HERE, HONESTLY,
I FEEL DEEPLY HUMBLED
AND HONORED --
NOT JUST TO BE WITH YOU GUYS,
BUT TO BE ON THIS SHOW.
YOU KNOW, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
STILL DON'T BELIEVE,
EVEN MY FRIENDS,
HOW REAL THE SHOW IS
UNTIL THEY COME
AND WATCH IT.
THEY STILL THINK,
"YOU MUST GET LINES,"
"IS IT REALLY
YOUR OWN MONEY?"
AND WE GET TO
GO AT EACH OTHER.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHETHER
YOU ARE A MOM, A DAD, A KID,
A IMMIGRANT,
YOU WALK ONTO THAT CARPET,
AND BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS THE ULTIMATE EQUALIZER,
AND EVERYBODY HAS A SHOT.
HALLELUJAH.
OH, LOOK AT THIS!
Corcoran: WHAT'S THIS?
HEY. WOW.
WOW.
HEY!
KEVIN, YOU'RE 100.
CONGRATULATIONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WOW.
LET'S OPEN IT UP.
BIG ENOUGH.
GIVE US CHAMPAGNE,
KEVIN.
100 EPISODES. YEAH.
WELL, WE HAVE TO HAVE
A TOAST, GUYS.
