WE'RE THE NEW-AGE
LEMONADE STAND.
BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS THE ULTIMATE EQUALIZER.
EVERYBODY HAS A SHOT.
HALLELUJAH.
GIVE US CHAMPAGNE,
KEVIN.
100 EPISODES!
YEAH.
[ ALL CHEER ]
HEY, HEY!
CHEERS.
Narrator: FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A PRODUCT TO DEFEND
AGAINST MOTHER NATURE.
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JOHN D. SMITH,
AND I'M FROM ORLANDO, FLORIDA.
I'M THE CREATOR
OF STORM STOPPERS.
I'M SEEKING $100,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT HURRICANES.
THEY'RE A LOT
LIKE YOUR IN-LAWS.
THEY GIVE YOU
LITTLE TIME TO PREPARE,
AND THEY CAN LEAVE
YOUR HOUSE A MESS.
[ ALARM BLARES ]
[ GREINER AND CORCORAN LAUGH ]
HURRICANE O'LEARY'S
APPROACHING.
BARBARA, HELP ME
PROTECT THE HOME.
NO PROBLEM.
THIS IS FACED BY MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD
EVERY TIME
THERE'S A HURRICANE.
EVERYONE GRABS PLYWOOD.
IT'S HEAVY, IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE,
AND IT LOOKS TERRIBLE.
[ Straining ]
ALL RIGHT. [ GRUNTS ]
COME ON, BARBARA.
THERE'S SOME
WING NUTS HERE.
THAT BOARD WOULD NOT STOP
HURRICANE O'LEARY.
JOHN, HURRY UP AND FINISH.
THE HURRICANE'S COMING.
YES.
O'LEARY'S COMING
TO YOUR HOUSE. HURRY.
SO, LET ME SHOW YOU
STORM STOPPERS.
YOU LINE IT UP,
AND YOU LOCK THE FIRST FASTENER.
AND THEN ALL YOU DO
IS GRAB THE MALLET.
TWO TAPS.
THERE YOU GO.
ALL THE WAY AROUND.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BARBARA.
I'M GOOD AT THIS.
[ LIGHT APPLAUSE ]
GREAT JOB, BARBARA.
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE,
STORM STOPPERS IS MUCH EASIER
TO USE VERSUS PLYWOOD.
HOW DOES IT HOLD UP
IN A HURRICANE-SIMULATION TEST?
SO, YOU'RE
LOOKING AT PLYWOOD.
THE 2x4 GOES RIGHT THROUGH.
NOW, WITH STORM STOPPERS...
WOW.
Corcoran and Greiner:
WOW.
2x4 BOUNCES RIGHT OFF <i>AND</i>
PROTECTS THE GLASS BEHIND IT.
THAT'S AMAZING.
WOW.
YEAH, IT IS AMAZING.
VERY IMPRESSIVE, JOHN.
WHAT DID YOU USE
TO ATTACH THAT?
JOHN,
HOW DO I TAKE IT OFF?
WELL, THERE'S TWO WAYS
YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF.
USE THE HANDLE AS ONE, BUT
OTHER WAY I HAVE TO SHOW YOU --
EVERYONE ELSE
BOLTS THEIR PRODUCT ON,
SO IF THERE'S A FIRE,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
WHERE DID HE GO?
[ GASPS ]
PUSH HARD, AND REMOVE IT.
NOW, WE SELL STORM STOPPERS
AS A KIT.
IT'S A PANEL,
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FASTENERS.
WHAT'S THE PRICE ON THAT PANEL
YOU'RE HOLDING THERE, JOHN?
UH, THIS IS
ABOUT 12 SQUARE FEET.
THIS KIT WOULD BE AROUND $85.
SO, THIS ISN'T CHEAP.
JOHN, WHAT ABOUT PLYWOOD?
WHAT DOES THAT --
PLY--
YOU KNOW, THE TYPICAL RETAIL
FOR A HOUSE WITH PLYWOOD'S $500.
HOUSE WITH STORM STOPPERS --
$2,500.
SO, FIVE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.
OUR CUSTOMERS TELL US
THEY'D RATHER
SPEND $2,500 ONCE
THAN $500 MANY TIMES.
NO, I-I GET IT, JOHN, BUT I'M --
I'M TRYING --
I'M LOOKING AT
THE OPPORTUNITY
FROM IN TERMS OF WHAT
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
TO MAKE THIS A STANDARD
INSTEAD PLYWOOD,
WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR DECADES.
SO, WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING
BECAUSE FOR $1 MILLION,
I WANT KNOW THAT THIS THING'S
WORKING OUT IN THE MARKET.
SO, THIS IS
MY 10th YEAR IN BUSINESS.
WE'VE DONE A LITTLE OVER
$5? MILLION IN SALES
TO 5,500 CUSTOMERS.
'05 AND '06,
WE DID $1.6 MILLION.
WHAT ABOUT
THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
LAST 12 MONTHS,
I'VE DONE $200,000.
MM.
WAIT, WAIT.
SO YOU'VE SEEN
A DROP-OFF?
WELL, OUR PRODUCT IS TIED
TO THE ECONOMY AND THE WEATHER.
IT'S LIKE SELLING UMBRELLAS.
YOU GOT TO HAVE RAIN
TO SELL AN UMBRELLA.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A FEAR.
YEAH, BUT JOHN --
I'D UNDERSTAND IF, IN A BAD YEAR
WITH LESS HURRICANES, YOU
GO DOWN TO $800,000 OR $700,000,
BUT $200,000 IS SO SMALL
RELATIVE TO WHERE YOU WERE.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I REALLY
HATE ABOUT THIS BUSINESS.
NOTHING STOPS ME, MR. WONDERFUL,
FROM DOING THIS MYSELF.
IF I WANTED TO, I COULD
SIMPLY GO BUY THESE SHEETS,
ATTACH THE VELCRO --
THIS IS FOR SALE TO ANYBODY.
NOTHING
PROPRIETARY THERE.
TO YOUR THING, THERE'S NO --
NOTHING PROPRIETARY.
I LIKE COCA-COLA.
DO I BUY IT BECAUSE
THERE'S MAYBE A PATENT
IN THE COKE VAULT?
NO, I BUY IT
'CAUSE I LIKE THE TASTE,
I LIKE THE WAY
IT MAKES ME FEEL.
SO, YOU STILL
BELIEVE IN IT?
ABSOLUTELY. AND OUR CUSTOMERS
BELIEVE IN IT, TOO.
LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING.
O'Leary: JOHN --
I-I JUST SEE SO MANY CHALLENGES
WITH THIS PROPOSITION.
UM, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU ONE REASON.
IT'S A HUGE REASON.
IT'S SAFETY.
I-I GOT THE DEMO.
I GOT THE DEMO.
BUT, NO, NO,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS.
I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING YOU'RE GONNA SAY
IS GONNA CHANGE THE OUTCOME
FOR ME, ANYWAY.
WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE
A MIND READER, LET ME TELL YOU.
WHOA.
DANG. THAT'S NOT
THE WAY TO SELL.
ALL RIGHT,
THE SALES ARE HORRIFIC.
SO, LOOK, YOU SHOWED ME
A REALLY INTERESTING TECHNOLOGY
THAT WORKS,
BUT NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT.
I'M OUT.
I TOTALLY BELIEVE
YOUR PRODUCT IS GOOD.
I THINK THE IDEA
THAT YOU COULD ESCAPE IN A FIRE
IS A GREAT ASSET,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
A HUGE SUPPLY OF THIS READY
FOR WHEN THE CONSUMER
NEEDS IT RIGHT AWAY,
SO YOU HAVE TO STOCK UP
AND LAY OUT A LOT OF CASH,
HOPING YOU'RE GONNA GET
A HURRICANE SOON.
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF CASH OUTLAY
AND NOT KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT.
SO, IT'S A ROUGH BUSINESS,
SO I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
MARK?
JOHN, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
AN EXPERT
IN RESIDENTIAL-HURRICANE
SAFETY AND PROTECTION,
BUT YOUR INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
AND YOUR SALE SKILLS ARE AWFUL.
IF YOU CHALLENGE KEVIN
WHEN BASICALLY
YOUR BUSINESS LIFE
IS ON THE LINE,
AND YOU'RE ASKING HIM
IF HE'S A MIND READER,
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHEN
YOU GET FLUSTERED IN A SITUATION
WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL
A HOMEOWNER OR A BUILDER.
I DON'T TRUST YOU
IN TERMS OF YOUR SALES ABILITY.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, LORI?
Greiner:
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU --
I THINK THAT IT'S
A REALLY SMART PRODUCT.
THANK YOU.
BUT, FOR ME,
I'M VERY CONCERNED
WITH HOW YOUR SALES
JUST COMPLETELY DROPPED.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
WOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, JOHN.
I'M WITH YOU, LORI. I THOUGHT
IT WAS A GREAT PRODUCT.
A REALLY SMART PRODUCT.
IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT.
IF I HAD ONE THING
TO DO OVER AGAIN,
I WOULD HAVE
LEFT THE TABLE OUT.
SO GOOD.
WE KNEW WE WERE
ONTO SOMETHING BIG.
THAT'S WHEN THE IDEA OF OUR
COMPANY POPPED INTO OUR MINDS.
WE SHOULD TRY THAT.
YEAH, WE SHOULD.
Jen: OUR PRODUCT IS A SPIN
ON SOMETHING
THAT EVERYONE'S HAD
FOREVER,
BUT WE'VE MANAGED TO MAKE IT NEW
AND EXCITING AGAIN.
IT'S HEALTHY, GLUTEN-FREE,
VEGAN, AND COMPLETELY DELICIOUS.
STARTING A BUSINESS IN NEW YORK
ISN'T ALWAYS THE EASIEST.
WE'RE WORKING FULL-TIME AT
IT AND BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET.
AND IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING
POPCORN I'VE EVER HAD.
IT COMPLETELY
ROCKED MY WORLD,
SO I IMMEDIATELY SHARED IT
WITH MY BROTHER.
AND NOT LONG AFTER,
PIPCORN WAS BORN.
PIPCORN'S DELICIOUS,
ALL-NATURAL,
AND YOU GUESS IT -- MINI.
Greiner: OH!
[ LAUGHS ]
EVEN BETTER,
THE SHELLS ARE
MUCH, MUCH, MUCH SMALLER
AND MORE DELICATE.
SO, SAY GOODBYE
TO THOSE THICK, HARD PIECES
THAT GET STUCK
IN YOUR TEETH.
NOW, BEFORE WE GET
TOO FAR ALONG,
LET'S GET TO THE REAL BUSINESS
AND HAND SOME OUT.
AND AS WE ALWAYS SAY...
Both: PIP-PIP HOORAY!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, SHARKS, OUR FLAVORS ARE
SEA SALT, ROSEMARY...
YES.
Herjavec: SEA SALT.
...KETTLE, AND EVERYONE'S
FAVORITE -- WHITE TRUFFLE.
SO, THE TRUFFLE'S ALL-NATURAL
TRUFFLE, THE REAL STUFF.
Jen: HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
THE ROSEMARY -- WE MAKE
ALL OF OUR ROSEMARY SEA SALT.
IT'S REALLY GREAT.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
SEA SALT'S MY FAVORITE.
I EAT IT
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I LOVE IT.
I LIKE IT.
Cuban: KETTLE'S GOOD.
Jen: THANK YOU.
EVERYTHING'S VEGAN AND
GLUTEN-FREE, ORGANIC, NON-GMO.
REALLY?
YEAH.
AND WE POP IT
IN OLIVE OIL.
CAN I GO TO THE FARMER MYSELF
AND BUY MY OWN KERNELS FROM HIM?
WHAT DO I NEED YOU FOR?
YOU CAN, BUT WE'RE
ACTUALLY GROWING SO QUICKLY
THAT WE'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO SIGNING
A TOTAL-EXCLUSIVE
FOR POPPING.
SO, WE'VE ACTUALLY GROWN 125%
IN SALES SINCE JANUARY.
IS HE THE ONLY FARMER THAT CAN
GROW THIS SMALL POPCORN?
NO, HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE,
BUT WE HAVE ABOUT TWO AND HALF
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.
WE HAVE TWO AND A HALF YEARS
OF KIND OF LEEWAY,
BUILDING A BRAND,
BUILDING A PRODUCT.
RIGHT, SO,
TELL US ABOUT THE REVENUE.
TELL US ABOUT WHERE YOU SELL.
LAST YEAR,
WE SOLD $200,000 AND...
THAT WAS ONLY
IN ABOUT 40 STORES.
WHAT KIND OF STORES?
WE'RE IN 18 WHOLE FOODS
CURRENTLY.
HOW MUCH DOES IT SELL FOR?
$4.99.
WHAT'S YOUR COST ON IT?
OUR IS A $1.80 AVERAGE.
THE TRUFFLE'S
THE MOST EXPENSIVE.
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
$1.80'S EXPENSIVE.
IT'S EXPENSIVE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE DOING ALL
THE MANUFACTURING OURSELVES.
SO, TO TAKE IT BACK
A LITTLE BIT,
WE LAUNCHED IN APRIL OF 2012,
AND ONE MONTH INTO THE JOB,
WE CAUGHT
THE ATTENTION OF OPRAH.
WE WERE FEATURED ON HER
"FAVORITE THINGS" IN NOVEMBER.
WOW.
SO WE WERE FORCED
TO REALLY SCALE-UP VERY QUICKLY,
BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING
WITH A CO-PACKER
TO OUTSOURCE
99% OF IT,
AND THAT WILL DOUBLE
OUR MARGINS.
WHAT WILL IT COST YOU AFTER
YOU'VE SCALE WITH THE CO-PACKER?
AROUND 92 CENTS,
AVERAGE.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE
BETWEEN THIS BAG
AND A TRADITIONAL POPCORN BAG
BESIDE IT?
IT DEPENDS ON
WHERE YOU'RE BUYING.
IF YOU'RE BUYING STORE BRAND,
IT'S A $1.99.
THIS IS $5,
AND THAT STUFF IS $2.
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THE SEED.
OH, MY GOD.
HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
WAIT, WAIT -- HEAR ME OUT.
IT'S A BROKEN RECORD.
AND I LOOK AT YOU, AND I SAY,
"IF I HAD $2 MILLION --
"A BAG WITH $2 MILLION IN IT
RIGHT HERE --
"COULD I FIND
A SISTER AND A BROTHER
WHO WOULD COME
AND WORK FOR ME?"
NOW, IF WE LISTENED TO
EVERYONE THAT SAID THAT TO US...
RIGHT.
...WE WOULDN'T BE HERE,
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
AMEN TO THAT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
AND -- AND --
SO, IGNORE HIM.
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW RIGHT
NOW THAT I'M PERSON
THAT'S WILLING
OR THE ONLY SHARK --
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
"MR. WONDERFUL" --
THAT TELLS THE TRUTH.
HA!
YOU WILL NOT GET
$200,000 FOR 10%.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT
RIGHT NOW.
OKAY. OKAY.
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY.
YOU'RE NOT WORTH
2 MILLION BUCKS.
ARE YOU TAKING A SALARY
FROM THE BUSINESS?
NO.
NEVER.
HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY TODAY
IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING MONEY
OUT OF THE BUSINESS?
LIKE, HOW DO YOU SURVIVE?
PERSONALLY.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN'T EAT
THAT MUCH POPCORN.
WE EAT A LOT OF POPCORN.
WE EAT A LOT OF POPCORN.
I LIVED IN MY FRIEND'S CLOSET
FOR A LONG TIME.
YEAH.
WE JUST WORK ALL THE --
CLOSET?
YEAH, IT WAS LIKE --
IT FIT A BED.
YEAH, IT FIT A BED.
IT FIT A BED.
IT WAS NICE.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT WAS A BIG CLOSET.
YOU KNOW WHAT -- LIKE,
IT'S LIKE WE WORK ALL THE TIME,
AND WE KNOW,
LIKE, TO YOUR POINT,
WE KNOW THAT IT IS
WORTH THAT.
WE KNOW THAT IT IS,
AND I'M SURE YOU HEAR THAT
ALL THE TIME, BUT --
TO MY POINT,
I KNOW IT ISN'T.
I THINK IT IS.
NO, IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
AH. I'M OUT.
Herjavec:
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL.
I LOVE THE BELIEF,
<i>LOVE</i> THE POPCORN.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANKS.
REALLY LOVE THE NAME.
BUT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE VALUATION?
$200,000 FOR 20% --
THAT'S MY OFFER.
CUT IT IN HALF.
HE JUST CUT IT IN HALF.
AND BY THE WAY,
HE'S OVERVALUING THE BUSINESS.
IT'S A LITTLE LOW FOR US
TO BE HONEST.
IS THERE A NUMBER THAT YOU
WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH?
$200,000 FOR 10%.
THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU CAME IN
ASKING FOR!
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S MY COUNTER.
THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS!
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
I MEAN,
WE THINK IT'S LOW.
ARE YOU SAYING "NO"
TO THAT OFFER?
BECAUSE, JUST TO BE CLEAR,
IT'S POPCORN.
I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH
HIS VALUATION FOR THE BUSINESS.
I REALLY DO.
I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACHING.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS ARE WINNERS.
I CAN SMELL IT A MILE AWAY.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, YEAH.
WHAT IS THE OFFER?
I'M YOU YOUR FULL PRICE.
WHAT?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
Herjavec: $200,000 FOR 10%?
YEAH, THERE'S ONLY
ONE CONTINGENCY.
YOU TAKE OUT $900
ON A GIVEN WEEK, OKAY?
I GET 10%.
$200,000 FOR 10%.
AND YOU GET DRAW
AS WE GO.
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
I GET MY MONEY BACK OUT,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I CAN'T FEEL LIKE A FOOL
WORKING MY BUNS OFF FOR YOU
WITH NO COMPENSATION.
RIGHT.
WELL, YOU WON'T
FEEL LIKE A FOOL.
YEAH.
I PROMISE YOU THAT.
COULD WE START THAT DEAL
IN YEAR 1
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE CASH OUT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT
TAKING CASH OUT ANYWAY.
SO YOU DON'T TAKE CASH,
I DON'T TAKE CASH.
YOU KNOW,
I THINK I'M IN A BAD DREAM.
WHENEVER YOU TAKE MONEY OUT,
I START TAKING MONEY OUT.
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING WITH HER,
AND SHE OFFERED YOU
$2 MILLION FOR <i>THIS?</i>
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WELL, SHE'S ASKING, THOUGH,
FOR MONEY BACK EVERY TIME.
BUT I LIKE TO PUT
ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE.
OH, THAT'S AWFUL!
THAT'S HORRIBLE!
THAT --
WHAT'S HORRIBLE?
SHE WANTS HER MONEY BACK?
OKAY, THIS --
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
YOU'RE OVERVALUING THE COMPANY,
BUT, YOU GUYS,
IT IS SO CLEAR
THAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS
A MASSIVE HOME RUN.
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
WE GET PEOPLE IN THE SHARK TANK
THAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN.
YOU GUYS GONNA KILL IT!
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA KILL IT.
THANK YOU.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED THE 100 BUCKS
A WEEK, LIKE BARBARA.
I'M DOING OKAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $200,000 FOR 10%.
WOW.
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT,
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE AS GOOD.
WE HAVE A CULT FOLLOWING.
I MEAN, IT WAS, YEAH.
PEOPLE LOVE
THEIR SQUATTY POTTYS.
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU LISTEN TO HOWARD STERN.
HE <i>LOVES</i>
THE SQUATTY POTTY.
ALL DAY.
HE WON'T QUIT TALKING ABOUT
THE SQUATTY POTTY.
WHEN YOU TRY IT,
YOU'LL SEE.
IT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
THIS IS THE FIRST
CRAPPY INVESTMENT I LIKE.
RIGHT.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
SO, LET'S GO BACK
TO THE NUMBERS FOR A SECOND.
ARE WE SAYING FOUR MILL
IN SALES THIS YEAR?
$4 MILLION?
OH, NO. WE'RE -- NO.
NO, WE'RE GONNA --
WE EXPECT $7 MILLION IN 2014.
WHY? BUT WHY? WH-- WH--
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR SALES
COME AT CHRISTMAS.
AT CHRISTMASTIME,
THIS IS A BIG PRODUCT?
REALLY?
43%.
WHAT ARE -- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE OFF THE $7 MILLION?
WHAT --
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA MAKE?
WE'RE EXPECTING TO EARN
$1 MILLION TO $1.5 MILLION
IN SALES, UH, UH, THIS YEAR.
SO, WHY --
IF YOU HAVE 80% MARGINS,
WHY AREN'T YOU MAKING MORE MONEY
OFF OF $7 MILLION IN SALES?
THE COST OF AC--
YOU KNOW, GETTING A CUSTOMER --
AND ED--
IT'S AN EDUCATION THING.
OKAY, SO WHAT'S --
WHAT'S YOUR COST PER
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION RIGHT NOW?
WELL, THE --
HOW MUCH ARE YOU SPENDING
ON ADVERTISING AND MARKETING?
FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS,
WE'VE BEEN ADVERTISING
ON HOWARD STERN.
FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND,
WE GET $5 -- $4 TO $5 IN SALES.
OUR DEMAND
IS AROUND THE WORLD.
WHEN WE MAKE THOSE PHONE CALLS,
T-THEY WILL GET ANSWERED.
YOU KNOW, BOB,
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH YOUR DEAL
IS HOW INSIGNIFICANT 5% IS,
AT LEAST FOR ME LOOKING AT IT.
YEAH.
I LIKE THE DEAL.
OKAY.
I'D GIVE YOU
THE $350,000 FOR 10%.
YEAH, SO, THAT'S --
YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM IS,
ON THE BACK END, IT'S GONNA BE
WORTH SO MUCH MORE.
LOOK, I THINK
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
A LOT OF VERBAL DIARRHEA
FROM KEVIN.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, LET --
SO, LET ME CLEAR THE THRONE.
OKAY.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE,
ROBERT.
KUDOS TO YOU.
IN A MILLION YEARS,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU HAVE THOSE KIND OF REVENUES.
I THINK
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE
THEIR MINDS ABOUT THINGS.
WE'RE GOING TO THE TOILET
A CERTAIN WAY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE
THAT PERCEPTION.
I MEAN, YOU'RE DOING IT, BUT
I GOT TO GO WITH MY GUT FEEL.
I JUST -- MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
O'Leary:
I'VE MADE YOU AN OFFER.
I'M OFFERING YOU
$350,000 FOR 10%.
BOBBY GETS
A LITTLE EXCITED.
I GET EXCITED.
HE VERY IS --
HE'S VERY TRUSTWORTHY.
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M JUST GOING BACK AND FORTH.
UM, I APOLOGIZE
IF I SEEM SCATTERED.
A SHARK CAN'T
GET INTERESTED IN 5%.
I'M NOT DOING IT FOR
LESS THAN 10% AND NEVER WOULD I.
ACTUALLY, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE LORI'S OFFER.
Cuban: THERE YOU GO.
[ HERJAVEC CHUCKLES ]
Greiner: GREAT.
I THINK -- I KNOW
THAT IT HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I DO KNOW THAT.
WE'RE EXCITED.
IT'S -- IT'S --
IT'S A SPREAD.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY
JUST THE BEGINNING.
AM I WRONG?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
TO DATE,
I'VE SOLD $245,000.
OVER THIS YEAR?
NO, OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $140,000.
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'RE INCREASING.
HERE'S WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
LIKE, SERIOUSLY, IT'S AMAZING --
THE FLAVOR, THE TEXTURE.
YES.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU BLOWN UP?
'CAUSE WE'RE RIGHT
ON THE EDGE OF BLOWING UP,
AND I WANTED
TO COME TO THE SHARK TANK
BECAUSE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME
GROWING A BUSINESS,
AND I NEED SOME SUPPORT.
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME HOW
YOU CAME UP WITH THE WHOLE IDEA.
ABSOLUTELY.
I GREW UP ON A VERY TRADITIONAL
AMERICAN DIET.
BY THE TIME
THAT I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL,
I WAS ALMOST 300 POUNDS AND...
WHO IS THAT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S ME
JUST GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL,
AND I KNEW
THAT THERE WAS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY DIET,
THAT THE BULLYING AND THE
RIDICULE THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED
GROWING UP WAS NOT FAIR
BASED ON THINGS THAT I DIDN'T
EVEN REALLY REALIZE
WERE THE REASON
WHY I HAD GAINED SO MUCH WEIGHT.
SO, REALLY,
I WAS INSPIRED TO COOK,
LEARN ABOUT NUTRITION,
TOOK ON A PLANT-BASED DIET,
AND REALLY STARTED TO SEE
THOSE POUNDS COME OFF,
AND MY LIFE HAS COMPLETELY
CHANGED FROM THAT.
NOW, DO YOU THINK
THAT ONLY VEGAN
OR PLANT-BASED-DIET PEOPLE
WILL EAT THIS?
NO, THIS IS
A HUGE CROSSOVER.
IT'S OKAY. GO AHEAD.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
BEING IN VEGAS.
ROLLING THE DICE.
AAH!
Greiner: YOU WANT $125,000.
I'LL DO IT FOR 30%.
I WANT TO HEAR IF THERE'S
ANY OTHER OFFERS, BUT I --
THAT'S A MISTAKE!
Herjavec: NO!
IF YOU WANT TO SIT
AND HEAR THE OTHER OFFERS...
GO AHEAD. IT'S KIND OF LIKE
BEING IN VEGAS.
ROLLING THE DICE.
AAH!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M OUT.
ME TOO.
ME TOO.
WE HAVE A DEAL!
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ SQUEALS ]
IT DID IN THE BEGINNING,
TOO. IT DID.
BUT A WHOLE LOT BETTER
AFTERWARDS.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
IT IS REALLY GOOD.
I'LL BUY IT. IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
SO AMAZING THAT I WAS JUST LIKE,
"I'M IN."
BEEP!
[ LAUGHS ]
HOLY BEEP!
[ Laughing ]
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
THAT'S ALL.
Narrator: TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE
"SHARK TANK"'S 100th EPISODE.
WOW.
CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE IT?
100 EPISODES.
IT'S AMAZING.
O'Leary:
STOP THE MADNESS.
YOU LOOK AT LEAST 10 YEARS OLDER
I THINK, ROBERT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE?
WHY ARE <i>YOU</i>
INTERVIEWING US?
YEAH, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW.
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL START THE INTERVIEW.
WHAT WAS YOUR
FAVORITE PITCH EVER?
THE GUY WITH THE BLUETOOTH
IN HIS EAR.
WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED
IS AN IMPLANTABLE
BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY.
HERE IS
THE SURGERY LOCATION.
THE SURGERY LOCATION?
THIS IS SURGERY.
YOU WOULD BE UNDER ANESTHESIA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I LIKE THE VOMIT ONE WHERE
THEY PUT THE VOMIT IN THE DOLL,
AND IT CAME OUT IN THE BAG.
JUST IMAGINE FOR A MINUTE
YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET
WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL,
LITTLE CHILD HERE.
THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE...
[ ALL GROANING ]
OH, GOD!
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE WAKE 'N' BACON?
THE WORLD'S FIRST ALARM CLOCK
THAT ACTUALLY WAKES YOU UP
WITH BACON.
[ LAUGHS ]
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
IT HEATS UP THE BACON.
YOU CAN THEN ACTUALLY
JUST ROLL OVER IN BED
AND EAT THE BACON YOURSELF.
YOU CAN COOK THE BACON
AND THEN EAT IT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
SHUT UP!
I'M SERIOUS.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW, THE ONES
WHO I'LL REMEMBER
ARE THE GREAT CHARACTERS.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THERE ARE NO WIRES ATTACHED.
DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO
NOTHING UP MY SLEEVES,
NOTHING IN MY BEARD.
CAN I GET A "WHOOP"?
WHOOP!
WHOOP!
WHOOP!
I LOVE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU LOSE A SOCK?
DO YOU
SCREAM BLOODY MURDER?
DO YOU KICK
THE WASHER/DRYER?
WELL, I HAVE A SOLUTION --
THROX.
THREE SOCKS.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
[ HIP HOP PLAYING ]
? I'D INVEST IF I WERE YOU ?
? AND I WANT TO DRAW
A CAT FOR YOU ?
? BREAD IT, MIX IT,
SHAKE IT, STIR IT ?
? BREAD IT, MIX IT,
SHAKE IT, STIR IT ?
NOW THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!
OY VEY.
OY VEY BIG-TIME.
TECHNOLOGY HARNESSES
THE SPIN OF THE EARTH.
THE WATER VAPOR IS DELIVERED
TO A VORTEX CHAMBER.
THE WASTE PRODUCT IS GOLD.
GOLD?
GOLD.
G-O-L-D?
G-O-L-D.
HOW LONG ARE YOU
VISITING EARTH?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
THERE WERE SOME MOMENTS
I WANTED TO CRY WATCHING
YOU GUYS DO SOME DEALS.
YOU'VE KILLED
SO MUCH MONEY.
100 EPISODES AND
300 ROYALTY OFFERS FROM KEVIN.
I SMELL A ROYALTY DEAL.
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: OH, MY GOD.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
$100,000.
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME 10%.
I'M GOING TO GO TO A 4% ON TOP
OF THE UNIVERSITY PATENT.
I WANT A 15% ROYALTY.
A 7% ROYALTY.
10% ROYALTY.
A $3 ROYALTY PER UNIT BECAUSE
YOU CAN AFFORD TO GIVE ME THAT.
AFTER I GET BACK FOUR TIMES
MY MONEY -- POOF -- I DISAPPEAR.
I WANT A ROYALTY.
THAT' ON THE TABLE, GREAT.
ANYONE ELSE?
Greiner: WELL, ONE OF THE
GREATEST THINGS ABOUT THE SHOW
IS THAT WE'VE CREATED
SO MANY JOBS IN AMERICA.
VERY HEARTWARMING.
YOU KNOW LORI?
I'LL TELL YOU,
YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO TAKE ABSOLUTE CRAP
AND TURN IT INTO GOLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU HAVE.
YOU HAVE MADE THE MOST MONEY
OFF THE STUPIDEST THINGS.
IT'S TRUE.
SIMPLY HANG YOUR READING GLASSES
OR YOUR SUNGLASSES.
BAM! CHECK IT OUT.
I CAN BEND OVER ALL I WANT,
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
SIMPLY, CUT THE PATCH TO SIZE
AND APPLY WITH HEAT
FROM A HAIR-DRIER
FOR 30 TO 60 SECONDS.
THE BUILT-IN SLOT IS DESIGNED
TO FIT EASILY AROUND
THE SEATBELT CATCH LIKE SO.
Krause:
I TAKE THE SCRUB DADDY.
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
IT'S JUST GONNA ATTACK
RIGHT INTO THAT BURNED-ON MESS,
AND IT'S GONNA CUT
RIGHT THROUGH THAT.
AND THAT CRAP
IS MAKING THEM ALL MILLIONS.
John: YOU KNOW
WHAT I FIND AMAZING?
THOSE KIDS THAT STAND THERE
ON THAT CARPET,
9, 10, 15 YEARS OLD.
I'M 11 YEARS OLD.
I'M YOU IN 30 YEARS.
I'M RYAN,
AND THIS IS BARKLEY,
WHO INSPIRED ME TO START
MY COMPANY, RYAN'S BARKERY.
GOING FROM HENRY'S HUMDINGERS
TO HENRY'S HUMDINGERS LLC.
WE'RE THE INVENTIONEERS.
SIX INVENTORS, AGES 12 TO 18.
MY NAME IS NOAH. I AM THE C.E.O.
OF PAPERBOX PILOTS.
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE SHARK
BY THE WAY?
I LIKE ALL OF YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AND SAY,
"MY 7-YEAR-OLD,
MY 9-YEAR-OLD LOVE THE SHOW,"
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT IT.
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
IN A SMALL WAY,
WE'RE A SPARK
TO THOSE PEOPLE.
BY THE WAY, BARBARA,
I HAVE TO THANK YOU.
HERE IT COMES.
I'M GOING DOWN THE ESCALATOR
AT L.A.X.,
AND THERE'S
A GUY HOLDING A SIGN.
IT'S NOT MY NAME,
IT SAYS "MR. WONDERFUL."
AND I THINK BACK TO SEASON 1
WHEN YOU GAVE ME THAT NAME,
AND I'M SO PROUD
TO WEAR IT NOW WITH HONOR.
I HAVE NEVER CALLED YOU
"MR. WONDERFUL."
Cuban: BARBARA,
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
STOP SPREADING THAT RUMOR.
I WOULDN'T THROW OUT THE 70%.
THAT LEAVES YOU WITH 30%
'CAUSE YOU GET TO WORK
WITH MR. WONDERFUL -- THAT'S ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY, WE'LL BEEN HERE
FOR YEARS NOW.
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?
THIS -- WE'RE
THE NEW-AGE LEMONADE STAND.
IT USED TO BE
WHEN YOU HAD A SON OR DAUGHTER
THAT YOU WANTED TO TEACH
ABOUT BUSINESS,
YOU HAD THEM SET UP A LEMONADE
STAND IN THE FRONT YARD.
John: YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SAY,
"WELL, THAT'S NOT REALITY.
YOU WOULDN'T NEGOTIATE
AGAINST FIVE PEOPLE."
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN YOU'RE OUT SHOPPING A DEAL,
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING
WITH 5, 10 PEOPLE.
IT'S JUST IN SEPARATE ROOMS.
NOW WE GET TO SEE
WHO BIDS AGAINST EACH OTHER,
AND WE GET TO
GO AT EACH OTHER.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHETHER
YOU ARE A MOM, A DAD, A KID,
A IMMIGRANT,
YOU WALK ONTO THAT CARPET,
AND BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS THE ULTIMATE EQUALIZER,
AND EVERYBODY HAS A SHOT.
HALLELUJAH.
OH, LOOK AT THIS!
Corcoran: WHAT'S THIS?
HEY. WOW.
WOW.
HEY!
KEVIN, YOU'RE 100.
CONGRATULATIONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WOW.
LET'S OPEN IT UP.
BIG ENOUGH.
GIVE US CHAMPAGNE,
KEVIN.
100 EPISODES. YEAH.
WELL, WE HAVE TO HAVE
A TOAST, GUYS.
ALWAYS TILT THE GLASS WHEN
THE CHAMPAGNE IS BEING POURED.
IT'S HOW YOU RESPECT
THE VINTAGE.
Cuban: IS FROM THE
WHAT SOCIETY -- THE DU TASTEVIN?
DU LE --
CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW THE TOAST IS DONE.
TO OUR 100th EPISODE.
HOLD YOUR PINKY OUT LIKE THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY NOT?
CHEERS.
All: CHEERS.
TO ANOTHER 100.
HEY, HEY!
Herjavec: CHEERS!
