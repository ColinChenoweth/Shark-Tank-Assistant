I'M JEN.
AND I'M JEFF.
JEFF, TRY THIS.
ONE DAY, JEFF WAS HELPING ME
MOVE APARTMENTS,
AND WE HAD NOTHING TO EAT
BUT WERE STARVING.
SO, I HAD A FEW INGREDIENTS
FROM A HEALTH-FOODS STORE.
WE STARTED MAKING IT,
AND IT WAS AMAZING.
Jeff: WE NEED
AN INVESTMENT FROM A SHARK
TO REALLY GET TO
THE NEXT LEVEL.
WE HAVE A GREAT PRODUCT.
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
THE MANUFACTURING
OR THE DISTRIBUTION
TO GET IT OUT THERE.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE'VE TAKEN
OUR LITTLE FAMILY COMPANY
AS FAR AS WE CAN
ON OUR OWN,
AND WE'VE LITERALLY GIVEN UP
EVERYTHING TO TAKE IT THIS FAR.
WE JUST REALLY HOPE
THAT ONE OF THE SHARKS LOVES IT
AS MUCH AS WE DO
BECAUSE IT'S EVERYTHING TO US.
HI, SHARKS, I'M JEN,
AND THIS MY BIG BROTHER, JEFF.
WE'RE FROM
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK,
AND WE'RE ASKING
FOR $200,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY,
PIPSNACKS.
JEN AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
ENTREPRENEURS.
AS KIDS,
INSTEAD OF LEMONADE,
WE WOULD SELL POPCORN
OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.
FAST-FORWARD 20 YEARS,
AND WE'RE ALL STILL MUNCHING ON
THAT SAME POPCORN UNTIL NOW.
I WAS WORKING AT
A HEALTH-FOODS STORE,
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT POPCORN COULD GET BETTER,
BUT A FARMER INTRODUCED ME
TO THIS SPECIAL VARIETY OF CORN.
I TOOK IT HOME
AND POPPED IT,
Herjavec:
SO, JEFF, I LOVE POPCORN.
BESIDES NOT GETTING
STUCK IN YOUR TEETH,
TELL THE VALUE-ADD
OF SMALL POPCORN.
JEN CAN'T EAT POPCORN.
IT KILLS HER STOMACH.
SHE ACTUALLY HAS
A COUPLE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.
PREVENTS HER
FROM EATING A LOT OF THINGS.
SHE FOUND THIS KERNEL
WORKING AT A HEALTH-FOODS STORE,
AND SHE COULD EAT.
IT'S WAY EASIER TO DIGEST.
IT'S SMALLER, IT'S CUTE,
IT'S ALSO --
THERE ARE SOME HEALTH BENEFITS.
IT'S MUCH HIGHER IN FIBER
THAN ORDINARY POPCORN.
HOW DO WE MAKE MONEY IS WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE YOU --
SO, ONCE WE GO TO
THE CO-PACKER --
YOU SAID
$200,000 FOR 10%, RIGHT?
YEAH, $2 MILLION VALUE.
THAT'S AN ACCUMULATED VALUE
OF $2 MILLION...
CORRECT.
...AND IT'S POPCORN.
CORRECT.
HOW DO I GET MY $200,000 BACK
IF I'M A 10% SHAREHOLDER?
SO, YEAR TO DATE,
WE'VE DONE $150,000 IN SALES.
WE'RE GROWING --
SINCE JANUARY, WE GROWN 124%.
YOU'VE MADE NO MONEY,
RIGHT?
NOT CURRENTLY,
BUT BY THE END OF THE YEAR,
WE'RE PROJECTED
TO MAKE $40,000.
ISN'T AMAZING I KNOW THAT?
WHY DO I KNOW THAT?
BECAUSE WE'RE
A SMALL MANUFACTURER,
AND -- AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
IN THE BEGINNING.
BUT YOU THINK THIS IS --
IDEA IS WORTH $2 MILLION?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
WELL --
OKAY, EXPLAIN WHY.
WE'RE GONNA
FINISH THE YEAR
AT JUST AROUND $440,000
IN SALES,
AND THAT'S IN 65 STORES.
AS SOON AS WE GET
A CO-PACKER --
CUT OUR COSTS
ALMOST MORE THAN HALF --
THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO
REALLY PUSH IT OUT, MAKE MONEY,
AND THEN WE CAN GO TO THE ENTIRE
REGION OF WHOLE FOODS.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE --
BARBARA AND ROBERT HAVE OFFERED
JEFF AND JENNIFER
THE AMOUNT THEY WERE SEEKING --
$200,000 FOR 10%
OF THEIR MINI-POPCORN COMPANY,
PIPSNACKS.
HOWEVER, BARBARA WANTS
10% OF ANY DISTRIBUTIONS
THAT THEY TAKE OUT
OF THE COMPANY.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE.
ONE THAT'S TAKING MONEY BACK
EACH TIME YOU TAKE MONEY,
AND ONE THAT ISN'T.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WELL -- WELL,
LET ME SUGGEST SOMETHING.
CAN YOU MATCH
ROBERT'S OFFER?
HIS OFFER -- NO.
THE BOTH OF YOU,
YOU'RE IDIOTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T START.
Greiner: HELP!
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE --
JUST SAY YES OR NO.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
[ CHUCKLING ]
YOU SAY IT.
BARBARA, WE'D LOVE
TO WORK WITH YOU.
SMART PEOPLE.
WE CAME IN HERE,
WE LOVE YOU, ROBERT.
I'M SORRY. WE REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BRING IT IN.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE HIM.
WE ALREADY DO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[ LAUGHS ]
WOW.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
WE'VE SEEN BARBARA DO
A TON OF FOOD, VERY HIGH-LEVEL.
WE TARGETED BARBARA
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
AND WE'RE SO HAPPY
SHE LIKE IT.
YEAH.
BARBARA, THIS IS GONNA BE
A HEARTBREAK FOR YOU.
NOT AT ALL.
EVERY TIME I EAT POPCORN NOW,
I'M GONNA CRY FOR BARBARA.
I'M GONNA --
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
BARBARA'S NOT SHARING.
OHH!!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH!
YOU KNEW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
