WE'RE THE NEW-AGE
LEMONADE STAND.
BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS THE ULTIMATE EQUALIZER.
EVERYBODY HAS A SHOT.
HALLELUJAH.
GIVE US CHAMPAGNE,
KEVIN.
100 EPISODES!
YEAH.
[ ALL CHEER ]
HEY, HEY!
CHEERS.
Narrator: FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A PRODUCT TO DEFEND
AGAINST MOTHER NATURE.
HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JOHN D. SMITH,
AND I'M FROM ORLANDO, FLORIDA.
I'M THE CREATOR
OF STORM STOPPERS.
I'M SEEKING $100,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT HURRICANES.
THEY'RE A LOT
LIKE YOUR IN-LAWS.
THEY GIVE YOU
LITTLE TIME TO PREPARE,
EVERYONE GRABS PLYWOOD.
JOHN, HURRY UP AND FINISH.
THE HURRICANE'S COMING.
YES.
O'LEARY'S COMING
TO YOUR HOUSE. HURRY.
SO, LET ME SHOW YOU
STORM STOPPERS.
THERE YOU GO.
ALL THE WAY AROUND.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BARBARA.
I'M GOOD AT THIS.
[ LIGHT APPLAUSE ]
GREAT JOB, BARBARA.
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE,
STORM STOPPERS IS MUCH EASIER
TO USE VERSUS PLYWOOD.
HOW DOES IT HOLD UP
IN A HURRICANE-SIMULATION TEST?
SO, YOU'RE
LOOKING AT PLYWOOD.
THE 2x4 GOES RIGHT THROUGH.
NOW, WITH STORM STOPPERS...
VERY IMPRESSIVE, JOHN.
WHAT DID YOU USE
TO ATTACH THAT?
JOHN,
HOW DO I TAKE IT OFF?
WELL, THERE'S TWO WAYS
YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF.
WHAT'S THE PRICE ON THAT PANEL
YOU'RE HOLDING THERE, JOHN?
UH, THIS IS
ABOUT 12 SQUARE FEET.
THIS KIT WOULD BE AROUND $85.
SO, THIS ISN'T CHEAP.
JOHN, WHAT ABOUT PLYWOOD?
WHAT DOES THAT --
PLY--
YOU KNOW, THE TYPICAL RETAIL
FOR A HOUSE WITH PLYWOOD'S $500.
HOUSE WITH STORM STOPPERS --
$2,500.
SO, FIVE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.
OUR CUSTOMERS TELL US
THEY'D RATHER
SPEND $2,500 ONCE
THAN $500 MANY TIMES.
NO, I-I GET IT, JOHN, BUT I'M --
I'M TRYING --
I'M LOOKING AT
THE OPPORTUNITY
FROM IN TERMS OF WHAT
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
YEAH, BUT JOHN --
I'D UNDERSTAND IF, IN A BAD YEAR
WITH LESS HURRICANES, YOU
GO DOWN TO $800,000 OR $700,000,
BUT $200,000 IS SO SMALL
RELATIVE TO WHERE YOU WERE.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I REALLY
HATE ABOUT THIS BUSINESS.
NOTHING STOPS ME, MR. WONDERFUL,
FROM DOING THIS MYSELF.
IF I WANTED TO, I COULD
SIMPLY GO BUY THESE SHEETS,
ATTACH THE VELCRO --
THIS IS FOR SALE TO ANYBODY.
NOTHING
PROPRIETARY THERE.
TO YOUR THING, THERE'S NO --
NOTHING PROPRIETARY.
I LIKE COCA-COLA.
DO I BUY IT BECAUSE
THERE'S MAYBE A PATENT
IN THE COKE VAULT?
NO, I BUY IT
'CAUSE I LIKE THE TASTE,
I LIKE THE WAY
IT MAKES ME FEEL.
SO, YOU STILL
BELIEVE IN IT?
LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING.
O'Leary: JOHN --
I-I JUST SEE SO MANY CHALLENGES
WITH THIS PROPOSITION.
UM, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU ONE REASON.
IT'S A HUGE REASON.
IT'S SAFETY.
I-I GOT THE DEMO.
I GOT THE DEMO.
I TOTALLY BELIEVE
YOUR PRODUCT IS GOOD.
I THINK THE IDEA
THAT YOU COULD ESCAPE IN A FIRE
IS A GREAT ASSET,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
A HUGE SUPPLY OF THIS READY
FOR WHEN THE CONSUMER
NEEDS IT RIGHT AWAY,
JOHN, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
AN EXPERT
WITH HOW YOUR SALES
JUST COMPLETELY DROPPED.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
WOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, JOHN.
I'M WITH YOU, LORI. I THOUGHT
IT WAS A GREAT PRODUCT.
A REALLY SMART PRODUCT.
IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT.
IF I HAD ONE THING
TO DO OVER AGAIN,
I WOULD HAVE
LEFT THE TABLE OUT.
SO GOOD.
WE KNEW WE WERE
ONTO SOMETHING BIG.
THAT'S WHEN THE IDEA OF OUR
COMPANY POPPED INTO OUR MINDS.
WE SHOULD TRY THAT.
YEAH, WE SHOULD.
Jen: OUR PRODUCT IS A SPIN
ON SOMETHING
THAT EVERYONE'S HAD
FOREVER,
AND IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING
POPCORN I'VE EVER HAD.
IT COMPLETELY
ROCKED MY WORLD,
SO I IMMEDIATELY SHARED IT
WITH MY BROTHER.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
SEA SALT'S MY FAVORITE.
I EAT IT
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I LOVE IT.
I LIKE IT.
Cuban: KETTLE'S GOOD.
Jen: THANK YOU.
LAST YEAR,
WE SOLD $200,000 AND...
THAT WAS ONLY
IN ABOUT 40 STORES.
WHAT KIND OF STORES?
WE'RE IN 18 WHOLE FOODS
CURRENTLY.
HOW MUCH DOES IT SELL FOR?
$4.99.
WHAT'S YOUR COST ON IT?
OUR IS A $1.80 AVERAGE.
THE TRUFFLE'S
THE MOST EXPENSIVE.
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
$1.80'S EXPENSIVE.
IT'S EXPENSIVE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE DOING ALL
THE MANUFACTURING OURSELVES.
SO, TO TAKE IT BACK
A LITTLE BIT,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT THE SEED.
OH, MY GOD.
HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
WAIT, WAIT -- HEAR ME OUT.
IT'S A BROKEN RECORD.
YEAH, IT WAS LIKE --
IT FIT A BED.
YEAH, IT FIT A BED.
IT FIT A BED.
IT WAS NICE.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT WAS A BIG CLOSET.
YOU KNOW WHAT -- LIKE,
IT'S LIKE WE WORK ALL THE TIME,
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT,
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE AS GOOD.
WE HAVE A CULT FOLLOWING.
I MEAN, IT WAS, YEAH.
PEOPLE LOVE
THEIR SQUATTY POTTYS.
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU LISTEN TO HOWARD STERN.
HE <i>LOVES</i>
THE SQUATTY POTTY.
ALL DAY.
HE WON'T QUIT TALKING ABOUT
THE SQUATTY POTTY.
WHEN YOU TRY IT,
YOU'LL SEE.
IT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
THIS IS THE FIRST
CRAPPY INVESTMENT I LIKE.
RIGHT.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
SO, LET'S GO BACK
TO THE NUMBERS FOR A SECOND.
ARE WE SAYING FOUR MILL
IN SALES THIS YEAR?
$4 MILLION?
OH, NO. WE'RE -- NO.
NO, WE'RE GONNA --
WE EXPECT $7 MILLION IN 2014.
WHY? BUT WHY? WH-- WH--
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR SALES
COME AT CHRISTMAS.
AT CHRISTMASTIME,
THIS IS A BIG PRODUCT?
REALLY?
43%.
WHAT ARE -- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE OFF THE $7 MILLION?
WHAT --
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA MAKE?
WE'RE EXPECTING TO EARN
$1 MILLION TO $1.5 MILLION
IN SALES, UH, UH, THIS YEAR.
SO, WHY --
IF YOU HAVE 80% MARGINS,
WHY AREN'T YOU MAKING MORE MONEY
OFF OF $7 MILLION IN SALES?
THE COST OF AC--
YOU KNOW, GETTING A CUSTOMER --
OUR DEMAND
IS AROUND THE WORLD.
WHEN WE MAKE THOSE PHONE CALLS,
T-THEY WILL GET ANSWERED.
YOU KNOW, BOB,
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH YOUR DEAL
IS HOW INSIGNIFICANT 5% IS,
AT LEAST FOR ME LOOKING AT IT.
YEAH.
I LIKE THE DEAL.
OKAY.
I'D GIVE YOU
THE $350,000 FOR 10%.
YEAH, SO, THAT'S --
YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM IS,
ON THE BACK END, IT'S GONNA BE
WORTH SO MUCH MORE.
LOOK, I THINK
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
A LOT OF VERBAL DIARRHEA
FROM KEVIN.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, LET --
SO, LET ME CLEAR THE THRONE.
OKAY.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE,
ROBERT.
KUDOS TO YOU.
IN A MILLION YEARS,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU HAVE THOSE KIND OF REVENUES.
I THINK
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE
THEIR MINDS ABOUT THINGS.
WE'RE GOING TO THE TOILET
A CERTAIN WAY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE
THAT PERCEPTION.
I MEAN, YOU'RE DOING IT, BUT
I GOT TO GO WITH MY GUT FEEL.
I JUST -- MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
O'Leary:
I'VE MADE YOU AN OFFER.
I'M OFFERING YOU
$350,000 FOR 10%.
BOBBY GETS
A LITTLE EXCITED.
I GET EXCITED.
HE VERY IS --
HE'S VERY TRUSTWORTHY.
UM, I APOLOGIZE
IF I SEEM SCATTERED.
A SHARK CAN'T
GET INTERESTED IN 5%.
WE'RE EXCITED.
IT'S -- IT'S --
IT'S A SPREAD.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY
JUST THE BEGINNING.
AM I WRONG?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
TO DATE,
I'VE SOLD $245,000.
OVER THIS YEAR?
NO, OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $140,000.
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'RE INCREASING.
HERE'S WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
LIKE, SERIOUSLY, IT'S AMAZING --
THE FLAVOR, THE TEXTURE.
YES.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU BLOWN UP?
'CAUSE WE'RE RIGHT
ON THE EDGE OF BLOWING UP,
I WAS ALMOST 300 POUNDS AND...
WHO IS THAT?
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S ME
JUST GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL,
IT'S OKAY. GO AHEAD.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
BEING IN VEGAS.
ROLLING THE DICE.
AAH!
Greiner: YOU WANT $125,000.
I'LL DO IT FOR 30%.
I WANT TO HEAR IF THERE'S
ANY OTHER OFFERS, BUT I --
THAT'S A MISTAKE!
Herjavec: NO!
GO AHEAD. IT'S KIND OF LIKE
BEING IN VEGAS.
ROLLING THE DICE.
AAH!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M OUT.
ME TOO.
ME TOO.
WE HAVE A DEAL!
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ SQUEALS ]
IT DID IN THE BEGINNING,
TOO. IT DID.
BUT A WHOLE LOT BETTER
AFTERWARDS.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
IT IS REALLY GOOD.
I'LL BUY IT. IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
SO AMAZING THAT I WAS JUST LIKE,
"I'M IN."
BEEP!
[ LAUGHS ]
HOLY BEEP!
[ Laughing ]
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
THAT'S ALL.
Narrator: TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE
"SHARK TANK"'S 100th EPISODE.
WOW.
CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE IT?
100 EPISODES.
IT'S AMAZING.
O'Leary:
STOP THE MADNESS.
YOU LOOK AT LEAST 10 YEARS OLDER
I THINK, ROBERT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE?
WHY ARE <i>YOU</i>
INTERVIEWING US?
YEAH, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW.
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL START THE INTERVIEW.
WHAT WAS YOUR
FAVORITE PITCH EVER?
THE GUY WITH THE BLUETOOTH
IN HIS EAR.
WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED
IS AN IMPLANTABLE
BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY.
HERE IS
THE SURGERY LOCATION.
THE SURGERY LOCATION?
THIS IS SURGERY.
YOU WOULD BE UNDER ANESTHESIA.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I LIKE THE VOMIT ONE WHERE
THEY PUT THE VOMIT IN THE DOLL,
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THERE ARE NO WIRES ATTACHED.
DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO
NOTHING UP MY SLEEVES,
NOTHING IN MY BEARD.
CAN I GET A "WHOOP"?
WHOOP!
WHOOP!
WHOOP!
I LOVE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU LOSE A SOCK?
DO YOU
SCREAM BLOODY MURDER?
DO YOU KICK
THE WASHER/DRYER?
WELL, I HAVE A SOLUTION --
THROX.
THREE SOCKS.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
[ HIP HOP PLAYING ]
? I'D INVEST IF I WERE YOU ?
THE WASTE PRODUCT IS GOLD.
GOLD?
GOLD.
G-O-L-D?
G-O-L-D.
HOW LONG ARE YOU
VISITING EARTH?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
THERE WERE SOME MOMENTS
I WANTED TO CRY WATCHING
YOU GUYS DO SOME DEALS.
YOU'VE KILLED
SO MUCH MONEY.
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: OH, MY GOD.
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
$100,000.
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME 10%.
I'M GOING TO GO TO A 4% ON TOP
OF THE UNIVERSITY PATENT.
I WANT A 15% ROYALTY.
A 7% ROYALTY.
10% ROYALTY.
A $3 ROYALTY PER UNIT BECAUSE
YOU CAN AFFORD TO GIVE ME THAT.
AFTER I GET BACK FOUR TIMES
MY MONEY -- POOF -- I DISAPPEAR.
I WANT A ROYALTY.
THAT' ON THE TABLE, GREAT.
ANYONE ELSE?
Greiner: WELL, ONE OF THE
GREATEST THINGS ABOUT THE SHOW
IS THAT WE'VE CREATED
SO MANY JOBS IN AMERICA.
VERY HEARTWARMING.
YOU KNOW LORI?
I'LL TELL YOU,
YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO TAKE ABSOLUTE CRAP
AND TURN IT INTO GOLD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU HAVE.
YOU HAVE MADE THE MOST MONEY
OFF THE STUPIDEST THINGS.
IT'S TRUE.
SIMPLY HANG YOUR READING GLASSES
OR YOUR SUNGLASSES.
BAM! CHECK IT OUT.
John: YOU KNOW
WHAT I FIND AMAZING?
9, 10, 15 YEARS OLD.
I'M 11 YEARS OLD.
I'M YOU IN 30 YEARS.
THIS -- WE'RE
THE NEW-AGE LEMONADE STAND.
IT USED TO BE
WHEN YOU HAD A SON OR DAUGHTER
THAT YOU WANTED TO TEACH
ABOUT BUSINESS,
YOU HAD THEM SET UP A LEMONADE
STAND IN THE FRONT YARD.
John: YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SAY,
"WELL, THAT'S NOT REALITY.
YOU WOULDN'T NEGOTIATE
AGAINST FIVE PEOPLE."
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN YOU'RE OUT SHOPPING A DEAL,
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING
WITH 5, 10 PEOPLE.
IT'S JUST IN SEPARATE ROOMS.
NOW WE GET TO SEE
WHO BIDS AGAINST EACH OTHER,
ALWAYS TILT THE GLASS WHEN
THE CHAMPAGNE IS BEING POURED.
IT'S HOW YOU RESPECT
THE VINTAGE.
Cuban: IS FROM THE
WHAT SOCIETY -- THE DU TASTEVIN?
DU LE --
CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW THE TOAST IS DONE.
TO OUR 100th EPISODE.
HOLD YOUR PINKY OUT LIKE THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY NOT?
CHEERS.
All: CHEERS.
TO ANOTHER 100.
HEY, HEY!
Herjavec: CHEERS!
