HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MARTIN HILL.
AND I AM THE OWNER AND CREATOR
OF THE BEEBO.
I AM SEEKING
A $200,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 20%
EQUITY STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
PARENTS HAVE BEEN BOTTLE-FEEDING
THEIR BABIES THE SAME WAY
FOR OVER 150 YEARS -- BABY IN
ONE HAND, BOTTLE IN THE OTHER.
I HAVE CREATED A PRODUCT
THAT ENHANCES THE WAY
PARENTS BOTTLE-FEED,
TAKING THIS PRECIOUS MOMENT
AND MAKING IT BETTER.
I AM VERY PROUD
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE BEEBO --
A BETTER WAY TO BOTTLE-FEED.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
OH...MY...GOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
O'Leary: OH, YEAH.
Hill: THE BEEBO
IS PEDIATRICIAN-APPROVED
AND EASY TO USE.
YOU SIMPLY PLACE THE BEEBO
OVER EITHER SHOULDER...
INSERT YOUR BABY'S BOTTLE...
AND THEN ROTATE
TO THE DESIRED FEEDING ANGLE.
HMM.
YOU CAN EVEN ROTATE THE BOTTLE
UP AND OUT OF THE WAY
FOR BURPING OR PLAYTIME.
THE BEEBO FREES UP A HAND
DURING FEEDING,
ALLOWING YOU
TO READ TO YOUR BABY,
CARESS YOUR BABY, EVEN ENJOY
FAMILY MEALS TOGETHER.
SO, SHARKS, WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME
IN GIVING PARENTS AND BABIES
THAT HELPING HAND
THEY NEED AND DESERVE?
Greiner: AH.
I'VE GOT SAMPLES FOR YOU.
ASHTON, ISN'T YOUR BABY HERE?
WHY DON'T YOU GO GRAB HER?
I'M PRETTY SURE MY BABY'S
A "NOT ON-CAMERA" BABY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT MY BABY
ISN'T PART OF THE EQUATION.
OH, THANK YOU. OH, OH,
LET ME GRAB ONE FOR LORI.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
SHE HAS A HARD TIME REACHING.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
IF YOU JUST HOLD ON
TO THEM FOR ONE SECOND,
I'LL SHOW YOU THE -- THE BEST,
EASIEST WAY TO USE THEM.
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO PUT IT
A LITTLE BIT LOW...
[ LAUGHS ]
...BECAUSE OF
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
[ CHUCKLES ] SO...
Kutcher: HOW MANY
DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOTTLES
CAN YOU USE FOR THIS?
LIKE, CERTAIN BABIES
LOVE THE DR. BROWN'S.
MM-HMM.
SOME LIKE THOSE COMOTOMOS.
MAN,
YOU KNOW YOUR BOTTLES.
HEY, LISTEN. I'M ON --
I'M ON -- I'M ON DAD DUTY.
SO, THIS IS MADE
OUT OF A VERY SOFT SKIN
SO THAT IT'S WATERTIGHT,
FLEXIBLE FOAM.
MARTIN, LET ME --
LET ME HAVE THE KID.
IT'S BASICALLY
AN EXTRA HAND.
CARLOS OR BOB?
YEAH, I'LL GO WITH THIS.
YOU KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ASHTON,
YOU'RE A FATHER RIGHT NOW.
WHY DON'T YOU
CHECK THIS OUT?
I-I...
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
GAME ON.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
YOU'RE A LITTLE...
[ SIGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
I LIKE IT.
[ SIGHS ]
GET IT.
THERE WE GO.
AND THIS IS FOR NEXT TIME
WHEN YOU HAVE TWINS.
[ LAUGHS ]
Hill: THERE YOU GO.
THERE WE GO.
Hill: WE DO GET --
DOUBLE DUTY.
WE DO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITH TWINS BUYING THIS.
MARTIN, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS?
I'M AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER
BY TRADE.
MY LITTLE BOY, JACOB,
HE -- HE WENT THROUGH A PHASE
OF REALLY STRUGGLING
WITH HIS BOTTLE,
SO I CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
BECAUSE HE WAS HIS MOST RELAXED
WHEN I WAS READING A BOOK
TO HIM.
I MADE MY PROTOTYPE
IN MY GARAGE,
I STARTED USING IT, AND EVERY
TIME HE'D SUCK HIS BOTTLE DRY.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
WE'VE SOLD ABOUT $20,000 WORTH
SINCE FEBRUARY.
AND HOW MUCH DOES EACH UNIT SELL
FOR, AND WHAT DO THEY COST YOU?
WHAT IS YOUR COST PER UNIT?
SURE, THE MSRP IS $39.95,
AND THE MANUFACTURED COST
PER GOODS SO FAR PER UNIT TO ME
IS $10.86.
SO, IN FEBRUARY,
WE ONLY SOLD ABOUT $1,800.
IN MARCH,
WE MORE THAN DOUBLED THAT.
WE ARE STARTING TO GET KIND OF
INUNDATED WITH BUYERS RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED
BY SOME BIG-BOX RETAIL.
AND YOU HAVE NOTHING
IN RETAIL NOW?
NO, NOTHING.
CAN I SEE A PACKAGE,
MARTIN?
YEAH, SURE.
Greiner: DID YOU DO
ALL OF THE PACKAGING YOURSELF --
THE DESIGNING
OF THE PACKAGING?
I HAD A LOT OF SAY IN IT.
IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL YOU
WHAT IT IS.
IT'S HARD.
I MEAN, I THINK YOU'D STRUGGLE
WITH THIS PACKAGING IN RETAIL.
THAT'S PART OF THE FUNDING.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA DO
A WHOLE BRAND REFRESH.
O'Leary: IS YOUR PATENT
ISSUED RIGHT NOW?
THE UTILITY PATENT
IS FULLY ISSUED.
WHY DID YOU NAME IT "BEEBO"?
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO, WHEN I INVENTED
MY FIRST PROTOTYPE,
I USED TO CALL IT "THE BOOBY."
OH, "THE BOOBY." [ LAUGHS ]
BOOBY -- I LIKE BOOBY --
I LIKE BOOBY BETTER.
SO, THAT GOT SHOT DOWN
BY MY WIFE.
I BET.
[ Laughing ] YEAH.
IT'S A GOOD NAME.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT IS. I THOUGHT SO, TOO.
O'Leary: I-I LIKE THIS PRODUCT.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
THE MESSAGING IS WEAK
ON THE RETAIL PACKAGE,
BUT I THINK THE UTILITY OF IT
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
IN MY BABY-FEEDING DAYS,
I REALLY HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE
WITH THE WHOLE DEAL
WITH THE BOTTLE.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
FOR 33.3%.
I THINK THE PRODUCT
IN RETAIL
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL
AFTER BEING REPACKAGED.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE CASH.
BUT I LIKE IT.
IT'S -- THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE
DEAL, STRAIGHT UP.
I'LL TAKE 1/3 OF THE BUSINESS.
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000.
Kutcher: HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN
MONEY HAVE YOU INVESTED IN THIS,
AND WHAT ARE YOUR PROJECTIONS
ON SALES FOR THE NEXT YEAR?
SO, WE'VE INVESTED
ABOUT $180,000 FROM DAY ONE.
AND YOUR PROJECTIONS
OVER THE NEXT YEAR?
OKAY, SO, MY GOAL FOR YEAR ONE
IS 14,000 UNITS.
THE REASON WHY THAT'S THERE
IS BECAUSE OF
MANUFACTURING CONSTRAINTS.
RIGHT NOW, WE ONLY HAVE
ONE SET OF MOLDS.
AND THEN NEXT YEAR,
MY GOAL IS TO START RAMPING UP
MORE INTO BIG-BOX RETAIL.
MARTIN, LOOK, YOU'VE DONE
AN AMAZING JOB WITH IT.
I ADMIRE THE FACT
THAT YOU PUT UP $180,000
TO START THIS BUSINESS.
I LOVE PEOPLE
THAT ARE ALL-IN.
YEP.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE HAD A BABY,
AND I HAD EVERY PROBLEM
YOU CAN IMAGINE
AND FOUND WAYS TO SOLVE IT,
YOU KNOW?
YEAH.
I NEVER REMEMBER THIS
BEING A PROBLEM FOR ME.
I JUST DON'T SEE THE PAIN.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
Herjavec: CONGRATS, MARTIN.
THANKS.
Greiner: I LOVE IT.
CONGRATS, ASHTON.
CONGRATS.
FIRST "SHARK TANK" DEAL.
ASHTON, FIRST DEAL. WHOO!
FIRST DEAL!
WHOO!
[ LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE ]
