I'M PETER TREADWAY, AND I'M
FROM LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.
MY COMPANY IS ACTON.
I AM HERE SEEKING $1 MILLION IN
EXCHANGE FOR 3.5% OF MY COMPANY.
WOW.
SHARKS, WE KNOW TRANSPORTATION
IS DESTINED TO CHANGE.
AT ACTON,
WE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
WEARABLE TRANSPORTATION --
ROCKET SKATES.
ROCKET SKATES ARE THE WORLD'S
SMALLEST ELECTRIC VEHICLE.
STEP INTO
A PAIR OF ROCKET SKATES,
AND YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE
AT ANYTIME.
YOU SIMPLY PRESS DOWN ON YOUR
HEEL TO ACTIVATE THE MOTORS,
AND THEN YOU PUSH OFF
TO GLIDE ALONG.
ROCKET SKATES WILL TAKE YOU
UP TO 10 MILES AN HOUR.
THEY'LL KEEP YOU GOING
FOR 10 MILES ON A SINGLE CHARGE.
HMM.
THEY COMMUNICATE WIRELESSLY
WITH EACH OTHER
SO THAT
THEY MAINTAIN THE SAME SPEEDS,
AND THEY ARE
COMPLETELY CONTROLLED
BY YOUR FEET --
NO REMOTE WHATSOEVER.
WE'VE BEEN PROMISED THIS FUTURE
FOR GENERATIONS.
AND NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
YOUR FUTURE HAS ARRIVED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
IS BACK.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
Treadway: SO,
I HAVE THEM ON BEGINNER MODE.
AND ONCE YOU PUSH OFF,
THE MOTORS WILL KICK IN.
THERE THEY ARE.
Herjavec: OH.
THIS IS --
BOY, YOU REALLY GOT THIS.
YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Herjavec: SHUT UP, ASHTON.
ONE LESS SHARK!
[ LAUGHTER ]
WATCH THE FISH TANK!
[ LAUGHTER ]
Herjavec:
ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Treadway: WONDERFUL.
Greiner:
OH, THERE YOU GO.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHOA, WHOA!
OOH!
LEAN FORWARD,
LEAN FORWARD.
PRIME TIME,
NATIONAL TV -- BOZO.
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT, IT'S
KIND OF COOL ONCE YOU GET GOING.
IT'S HARDER
THAN IT LOOKS.
IT -- IT LOOKS HARD!
O'Leary: SO, PETER, OBVIOUSLY,
THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE,
AND YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
MANY PEOPLE TRYING THESE OUT.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA TAKE
FOR SOMEBODY
TO GET PROFICIENT
WHERE THEY DON'T
NEED TO BE HELD UP
AND LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ON THEIR
WAY TO THE RETIREMENT HOME?
Treadway: WELL, I MEAN --
NOBODY HELD ME!
YEAH.
MOST OF OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS
AND -- AND YOUNGER.
AND FOR MOST OF THEM,
THEY JUST GET ON
AND START RIDING RIGHT AWAY.
PETER, HOW MUCH ARE THEY?
HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
THESE ARE $499, $599,
AND $699, SO --
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN PRICES?
THE DIFFERENCE IS RANGE.
SO, WE HAVE A 6-, 8-,
AND 10-MILE VERSION.
AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE THEM?
OUR COST STRUCTURE
IS AROUND, SAY, 40%.
SO IT COSTS YOU $200 TO MAKE
THE $500 -- THE $499 VERSION?
SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE.
WAS THIS --
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO VARIABLE ABOUT IT?
WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
WATCH THIS SHOW.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR INVESTORS.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR INVESTORS.
YEAH, I'M -- IT'S A PRETTY --
IT'S A PRETTY ACCURATE ANSWER.
PETER, ARE PEOPLE
BUYING THEM AS A TOY?
PEOPLE ARE BUYING THEM
MOSTLY FOR FUN,
BUT WE GET VIDEOS ALL THE TIME
FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE USING THEM
TO ACTUALLY GET TO THE TRAIN,
TO ACTUALLY GO TO WORK.
Cuban: YEAH,
IF YOU'RE ON A CAMPUS --
I MEAN, I USED TO
ROLLER-SKATE AROUND INDIANA.
I MEAN, THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN BADASS.
Herjavec: OF COURSE,
YOU'RE DEFINITELY ON A TRAIN --
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT
ON THIS?
TWO UTILITY PATENTS,
FOUR DESIGN PATENTS,
AND THEN WE HAVE 16 PATENTS
THAT ARE PENDING RIGHT NOW.
Herjavec: PETER,
A $30 MILLION VALUATION.
HOW IS THIS
A $100-MILLION BUSINESS?
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
LAST YEAR, WE HAD
A MILLION AND A HALF IN SALES,
WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH
OUR FIRST REAL YEAR OF SALES.
THIS YEAR,
WE'RE UP TO $2 MILLION SO FAR.
WHAT CHANNELS?
OUR WEBSITE,
AND WE HAVE SPENT
THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR
TALKING WITH A LOT OF BIG-BOX
STORES, PEOPLE LIKE TARGET.
YOU'RE HOPING TO SELL THIS
AT $500 IN A TARGET?
YES.
BUT WE DO HAVE
A-A LESS-EXPENSIVE VERSION.
WE -- THAT WAS --
PETER, BASED ON THE TRAJECTORY
YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR,
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL NET
THIS YEAR?
UH, $10 MILLION.
$10 MILLION?
Herjavec: $10 MILLION?
YES.
THAT'S A HELL OF A RAMP.
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUILD THE INVENTORY
TO PUT INTO RETAIL
TO GET THAT NUMBER?
AND CAN YOU BUILD THAT MUCH?
Treadway: YES.
WE'RE TALKING WITH
A-A COUPLE OF NEW FACTORIES.
BUT THE FACTORIES THAT
WE'RE WORKING WITH AT THE MOMENT
ARE ABLE TO DO
HUNDREDS OF THEM EVERY DAY,
SO WE'RE GETTING THAT STARTED
IN THE NEXT COUPLE --
Greiner: HOW MANY A MONTH?
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY THOUSAND A MONTH?
OH,
I DON'T KNOW OFFHAND.
Kutcher: WHAT HAS
YOUR FINANCING BEEN TO DATE?
WE'VE HAD
A $2 MILLION SEED ROUND,
AND WE'VE JUST CLOSED THE FIRST
TRENCH OF OUR "A" ROUND,
WHICH WAS $2 1/2 MILLION,
SO WE'RE --
AN ADDITIONAL
$2 1/2 MILLION?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF THAT?
$2 1/2 MILLION?
UM, UH...
FORGIVE ME --
THE NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE JUMBLED
IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW,
BUT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, 20...
SOMEWHERE AROUND 20 --
$20 MILLION PRE-MONEY
VALUATION, AND ANOTHER
$2 1/2 MILLION WENT IN?
SOMEWHERE AROUND --
SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE.
Cuban: PETER, WHAT -- WHAT'S
YOUR MONTHLY BURN RIGHT NOW,
AND WHAT'S
YOUR BREAK-EVEN POINT?
THE BREAK-EVEN POINT
IS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK,
AND WE'RE -- WE'RE AT
ABOUT 100 GRAND A MONTH.
Herjavec: SO, PETER,
I LOVE THE TECHNOLOGY.
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THIS IS SUCH A HUGE MARKET,
ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUTERS.
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T LIKE.
YOU'VE RAISED, WHAT, TWO ROUNDS?
YES, TWO ROUNDS.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE PRICED IN
A $28 MILLION VALUATION.
YOU NEED INCREDIBLE EXECUTIONAL
EXCELLENCE ALL ALONG THE PATH...
MM-HMM.
...FOR ME AT 3 1/2%
TO GET A GREAT RETURN.
SO THE ONLY WAY
I'LL EVER MAKE MONEY
IS IF YOU HIT IT
OUT OF THE BALLPARK.
WELL, LET'S DO THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD ANSWER.
I'M HOLDING THE BAT OUT.
THIS IS GOING OUT.
I'M A BELIEVER. I-I GET IT.
IT'S GOING OUT.
I'LL DEFINITELY BUY THEM,
BUT, YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOWER
YOUR VALUE BY HALF.
I JUST KNOW THAT. YOU CAME HERE
WITH A VERY SPECIFIC VALUE.
OBVIOUSLY,
WE HAVE OTHER INVESTORS,
AND WE CAN'T, YOU KNOW,
THROW THE VALUATION AROUND
TOO MUCH.
BUT I CAME HERE TO MAKE A DEAL,
SO THAT IS --
I MEAN,
I'M NOT HERE BY MISTAKE.
THIS IS A GREAT MOMENT FOR ME
AND FOR OUR COMPANY.
I-IT'S FUN.
3 1/2% AT A $28 MILLION
VALUATION ISN'T FUN FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
AND LORI IS SKEPTICAL
ABOUT PETER'S MOTIVATION
TO MAKE A DEAL
FOR HIS ELECTRIC-POWERED SKATE
COMPANY, ACTON ROCKET SKATES.
Greiner:
MY GUT TELLS ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY
DYING FOR A DEAL HERE TODAY.
I MEAN,
I AM HERE TO MAKE A DEAL.
I'VE -- I'VE PRESENTED
MY NUMBERS THAT --
THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE,
BUT I'M CAPABLE OF NEGOTIATING.
I'M OUT.
THAT'S WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED HERE, PETER.
YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET INTERESTED
PARTIES THAT MAY HAVE LIKED THIS
TO GIVE YOU A MILLION BUCKS
AT 3 1/2%.
SO MY JOB IS TO MAKE YOU
PAY THE REAL PRICE
FOR GETTING THIS
ELUSIVE PLATFORM ON YOUR SIDE.
WELL, I WANT TO COUNTER.
8%.
I THREW YOU A BONE
BECAUSE I'M A GENEROUS MAN.
I TOLD YOU
I HAD NO FLEXIBILITY.
IT WAS AN OFFER --
MY ONLY OFFER --
AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND
YOU TAKE IT.
I WANT 15%.
YES OR NO?
WELL...
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK, PETER.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK.
WE'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
YOU MADE
A HUGE MISTAKE.
BYE-BYE. THANK YOU.
Herjavec: I THOUGHT
HE HAD WAY MORE FLEXIBILITY
THAN I EVER THOUGHT HE WOULD.
UH-HUH.
I GAVE HIM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE RANGE OF WHAT IT'S WORTH.
NO, YOU GAVE HIM WELL BELOW
THE RANGE OF WHAT IT'S WORTH.
THAT'S 4 BELOW.
LOOK, I HAVE TO BE PAID
FOR THE RISK I'M TAKING
BECAUSE I THINK
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN HERE IS,
THIS GUY IS NOT GONNA GET
ANYWHERE NEAR
THE SALES HE THOUGHT 'CAUSE
THE PRODUCT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.
I AGREE. I AGREE.
WE'LL FIND OUT.
I THINK HE'S GONNA HAVE
A HARDER TIME THAN HE THINKS.
