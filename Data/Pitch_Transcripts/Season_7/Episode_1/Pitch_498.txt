MY NAME IS JESS SANCHEZ McCLARY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MY COMPANY IS McCLARY BROS.,
NAMED AFTER MY TWIN
4-YEAR-OLD BOYS, JACK AND BEN.
WELL, I'M GONNA TICKLE YOU!
[ LAUGHING ]
IN 2008, MY HUSBAND AND I
HAD A SMALL PUBLISHING COMPANY
THAT WENT UNDER.
IT WAS DEVASTATING,
AND WE LOST EVERYTHING.
WE EVEN HAD TO MOVE IN
WITH HIS PARENTS.
BUT THE SILVER LINING
WAS THAT IT MOTIVATED ME
TO START McCLARY BROS.
THANK YOU.
WONDERFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
UH-HUH. YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
GROWING MY OWN SMALL BUSINESS
HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE,
AND IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH
THAT MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH
WORK FULL-TIME IN THE BUSINESS.
ALSO, I GET TO HELP
SPUR THE ECONOMY OF DETROIT.
WE MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS HERE,
WE CREATE JOBS HERE,
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME TO BE A
POSITIVE PART OF THE COMMUNITY.
KNOCK-KNOCK?
WHO'S THERE?
THIS IS HOW I FEED MY FAMILY,
AND I NEED A DEAL FROM THE
SHARKS SO I CAN GROW MY COMPANY.
FROM THE DAY I STARTED THIS
BUSINESS, I DID IT FOR MY SONS.
I WANT THEM TO BE PROUD
OF WHAT I BUILT FOR THEM
AND OUR COMMUNITY.
HI, SHARKS. MY NAME
IS JESS SANCHEZ McCLARY.
AND MY COMPANY IS McCLARY BROS.
AND I'M SEEKING $100,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 15% OF MY COMPANY.
TYPICAL DRINK MIXERS ARE LOADED
WITH ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS,
COLORS, AND PRESERVATIVES.
BUT BACK IN THE 1700s,
THAT'S NOT HOW THEY DID IT.
THEY MIXED DRINKS WITH
DRINKING VINEGARS CALLED SHRUBS,
AND THESE COLONIAL-ERA MIXERS
ARE PERFECT
FOR CRAFT-COCKTAIL ENTHUSIASTS
AND INDIVIDUALS LOOKING
FOR A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE
TO TRADITIONAL SODAS.
AND I'M BRINGING
THIS OLD-FASHIONED FAVORITE BACK
AND INTO THE 21st CENTURY.
INTRODUCING McCLARY BROS.'
DRINKING VINEGARS.
OUR DRINKING VINEGARS
ARE MADE WITH ORGANIC,
UNPASTEURIZED
APPLE-CIDER VINEGAR
AND ONLY NATURAL,
ORGANIC INGREDIENTS.
OUR VINEGARS LIVEN UP DRINKS
AND EXCITE THE CONSUMER,
INTRODUCING THEM
TO A VIBRANT, REFRESHING,
NEW FLAVOR EXPERIENCE
THAT WILL CHANGE THE WAY
THEY THINK
OF THAT AGE-OLD STAPLE
AND CLASSIC PRESERVATIVE --
VINEGAR.
NOW, WHO'S THIRSTY?
[ CHUCKLES ]
HIT ME.
CHEERS!
McClary: THIS ONE HAS
OUR FIG-LEAF DRINKING VINEGAR
AND GIN,
AND IT HAS, ALSO,
SOME CITRUS IN THERE.
I KNOW THERE'S A VARIETY OF --
NOT ENOUGH GIN. [ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
Herjavec:
I CAN'T TASTE THE ALCOHOL.
[ COUGHS ] ALCOHOL.
ROBERT,
YOU JUST KILLED THAT?
WHOO!
HE'S A THIRSTY MAN.
WE HAVE EXTRAS.
NEXT!
THIS ONE WAS REALLY GOOD.
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?
THIS ONE IS OUR APPLE PIE
WITH BOURBON.
Greiner:
OH, THAT'S VERY GOOD.
YEAH,
THAT'S OUR SIGNATURE FLAVOR.
IT'S VERY GOOD.
CAN WE SEE THE PACKAGING,
SOME OF THE BOTTLES?
THIS IS OUR PINEAPPLE
AND FENNEL-SEED FLAVOR.
ARE THESE THE SAME?
YES, THEY'RE ALL
THE SAME FLAVOR.
JESS, WHAT'S THE BACKSTORY
ON THE PRODUCT?
McClary: SO,
WHEN I STARTED McCLARY BROS.,
I WAS IN CULINARY SCHOOL.
I STARTED DOING SOME RESEARCH,
AND I LIKED THE OLD-FASHIONED
PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES
BECAUSE THEY HAD
REALLY SIMPLE INGREDIENTS,
AND THERE WASN'T A LOT OF
ARTIFICIAL STUFF IN THERE.
AND WHEN I CAME ACROSS
THIS CONCEPT,
IT WAS JUST
A TOTAL LIGHT BULB.
SO, YOU'RE USING VINEGAR
AS THE PRESERVATIVE
INSTEAD OF
ARTIFICIAL PRESERVATIVES.
IS THAT IT?
RIGHT, CORRECT.
I'M NOT SURE AMERICA'S READY FOR
VINEGAR RIGHT AT THE NOSTRIL.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW --
Kutcher: THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I MEAN, THERE ARE,
LIKE, KOMBUCHAS.
THERE ARE PEOPLE
THAT DRINK APPLE-CIDER VINEGAR.
AND I HATE ALL THOSE, TOO.
YEAH, BUT IT DOESN'T --
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PALATE.
O'Leary: JESS,
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK.
SALES CAN PROVE ME WRONG.
WHAT DO YOU GOT IN SALES?
WE HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS
SINCE 2012,
AND WE HAVE $305,000 IN SALES.
MY WIFE DRINKS VINEGAR...
EVERY DAY.
Greiner: I DO, TOO.
O'Leary: WHY?
IT'S JUST AS A BEVERAGE.
I DO, TOO, BECAUSE IT'S HEALTHY.
SO, EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT THE HEALTH REASONS ARE.
McClary: STUDIES THAT
HAVE BEEN DONE HAVE SHOWN
IT WILL HELP REDUCE
CHOLESTEROL LEVELS,
AND IT MAY HELP
KEEP BLOOD-SUGAR LEVELS
FROM SPIKING DRAMATICALLY
AFTER A MEAL.
WELL, ARE YOU MARKETING THIS
AS A MIXER,
OR ARE YOU MARKETING IT
AS A BEVERAGE
TO BE DRINKING STRAIGHT?
WELL, WE -- THE WAY WE TRY
TO MARKET IT IS AS A MIXER,
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
INCREASINGLY
THAT ARE DRINKING IT
AS A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE
TO TRADITIONAL SODAS.
NOW, JESS, HOW ARE YOU
GONNA GROW YOUR SALES?
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOUR GROWTH
COMING FROM?
WELL,
WE'VE JUST NOW STARTED
TO GET INTO
LARGER RESTAURANT CHAINS
THAT ARE LOOKING TO GRAB
THAT HIGHER-MARGIN,
CRAFT-COCKTAIL CUSTOMER
BECAUSE AS CRAFT COCKTAILS
BECOME COOLER,
IT'S HARDER FOR SOME
OF THOSE LARGER CHAINS
TO REALLY KEEP COMPETITIVE.
SO, IT BECOMES
A DIFFERENTIATED TASTE
THAT YOU CAN'T GET MANY PLACES.
RIGHT.
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO BE
THE GO-TO BRAND FOR THAT.
EXACTLY.
O'Leary: BUT CAN YOU ESTIMATE
HOW BIG THIS MARKET IS?
ARE WE TALKING A $500 MILLION,
$300 MILLION, $200 MILLION?
Cuban: NO.
HOW -- HOW BIG?
$10 MILLION MAYBE.
I MEAN --
O'Leary: $10 MILLION?
BUT IF IT BREAKS OUTSIDE
OF VINEGAR, IT CAN GET
REALLY, REALLY BIG.
IT'S HIGH-END MIXERS.
Herjavec:
SO, FOR YOU TO REALLY GROW,
YOU'VE GOT TO GROW
MORE CUSTOMERS.
Cuban: THEY'RE TRYING
TO CREATE A CATEGORY...
O'Leary: I DON'T LIKE THAT.
...HIGH-END VINEGAR MIXERS.
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO.
IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT TRYING
TO MOVE INTO THAT DIRECTION
BECAUSE BARTENDERS LOVE
PLAYING WITH SOMETHING NEW.
Greiner: I DON'T
REALLY DRINK HARD LIQUOR,
SO I'M NOT VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE
IN THE ARENA.
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES
OF UNPASTEURIZED
CIDER VINEGAR.
I WOULD SEE
IF YOU COULD DO
SOME TYPE OF INDEPENDENT
LABORATORY TESTING
WHERE YOU COULD HAVE MORE TO SAY
ABOUT MIXING THIS WITH ALCOHOL.
MAYBE CALMER STOMACH EXPERIENCE
OR HELPS YOUR DIGESTION.
MM-HMM.
WHATEVER IT IS, I HOPE
THAT YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT.
I THINK IT'S DOWN THE ROAD
FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU,
BUT I'M OUT.
JESS, IT'S A GREAT BRAND.
IT'S A GREAT LOOK.
THANK YOU.
Kutcher: MM-HMM.
IT'S A NICHE THAT YOU OWN,
AND YOU'RE PROFITABLE.
IF YOU COULD START
GETTING MORE MOMENTUM
AND YOU START GETTING IT
A LITTLE BIT WIDER,
I ACTUALLY THINK
YOU CAN PIVOT
AND GROW THIS INTO
A SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS.
BUT UNLIKE MY WIFE,
I'M NOT A FAN OF VINEGAR DRINKS,
SO I'M OUT.
THANKS SO MUCH.
GOOD LUCK, JESS.
THANK YOU.
GO OUT AND CRUSH IT.
McClary:
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT MY PITCH.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD.
WE ARE MAKING A PROFIT
EVERY YEAR, SO WE'LL GET THERE.
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE LONGER
THAN WE WOULD LIKE IT TO.
