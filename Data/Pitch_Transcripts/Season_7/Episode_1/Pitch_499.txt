BILLIONAIRE SILICON VALLEY TITAN
CHRIS SACCA...
IF CHRIS IS WILLING TO ACCEPT
MY HAND BACK IN --
LOOK,
YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE
BECAUSE YOU'RE SWIMMING
IN MY WAKE.
NO, THAT'S NOT --
YOU'RE RIDING MY COATTAILS.
YOU KNOW
WHAT I COULD BRING.
...MUSIC INDUSTRY PIONEER,
TECH INVESTOR,
AND BRANDING EXPERT
TROY CARTER....
THERE'S ANOTHER KID IN
THE GARAGE THAT WANTS
TO EAT YOUR LUNCH.
I JUST
DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.
AND I DON'T SEE MY INVESTMENT
HAPPENING. I'M OUT.
Narrator: ...AND TONIGHT,
PROLIFIC INVESTOR
AND VENTURE CAPITALIST
ASHTON KUTCHER JOINS THE TANK.
LET'S TALK ABOUT DEMAND.
IF YOU HAVE REAL DEMAND,
YOU CAN'T KEEP THE PRODUCT
ON SHELVES.
YOU HAVE MANUFACTURING
CONSTRAINT.
THAT'S DEMAND.
Narrator: IT'S A BRAND-NEW
SEASON OF "SHARK TANK."
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
NO, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.
I DON'T CARE, MARK!
YOU'RE BELITTLING PEOPLE,
AND THAT'S NOT OKAY.
NO, I'M NOT!
DON'T GIVE ME THAT BULL.
I WANT AN ANSWER.
SHE GAVE YOU AN ANSWER!
KIND OF SPICY, RIGHT?
Narrator: AND IT ALL STARTS...
NOW.
LET'S DO THIS.
Narrator: FIRST INTO
THE TANK IS ONE DAD'S SOLUTION
TO MAKE BABIES'
FEEDING TIME EASIER.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS CHRIS GILPIN.
AND I AM THE PRESIDENT
OF SignalVault LLC.
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING $200,000
FOR 12 1/2% OF MY COMPANY.
SHARKS, I'M SURE WE'VE ALL
RECEIVED THAT PHONE CALL
FROM THE BANK ASKING US
IF WE HAVE OUR DEBIT CARDS
BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEING SOME
"UNUSUAL ACTIVITY" IN TIMBUKTU.
AS AN IDENTITY-THEFT
AND COMPUTER-CRIMES EXPERT,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT HACKERS
CAN BUILD A DEVICE
THAT CAN STEAL YOUR NAME,
CARD NUMBER, EXPIRATION DATE,
AND SECURITY CODE FROM YOUR CARD
WHILE IT'S STILL IN YOUR WALLET
OR PURSE.
IMAGINE I'M A HACKER.
YOU GUYS WOULD ALL BE VULNERABLE
BECAUSE YOU'RE WITHIN RANGE
OF MY SCANNER,
WHICH IS OUTLINED
BY THIS RED TAPE.
THIS WALLET WAS TURNED IN TO
THE "SHARK TANK" LOST AND FOUND,
AND THIS IS A RFID SCANNER
THAT HACKERS CAN PURCHASE ONLINE
FOR AS LITTLE AS $25.
LET'S SEE THE INFORMATION WE CAN
CAPTURE WITH JUST A QUICK SCAN.
[ BEEP ]
OH, MR. CUBAN, I THINK
YOU MAY HAVE DROPPED THIS,
AND THAT IS WHY I DEVELOPED
THE SignalVault CREDIT-
AND DEBIT-CARD PROTECTOR.
AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW EASILY
YOU CAN PROTECT YOUR WALLET.
SIMPLY PLACE THE SignalVault
NEAR YOUR CARDS,
AND OUR E-FIELD TECHNOLOGY
MAKES YOUR INFORMATION
INVISIBLE TO HACKERS.
[ BEEP ]
CONTRARY TO OTHER ANTI-HACKING
SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE,
THE SignalVault NEVER NEEDS
CHARGING OR BATTERIES
AND FITS IN ANY WALLET.
SO, SHARKS, I JUST NEED TO KNOW,
WHO WANTS TO HELP ME
PROTECT MILLIONS OF VICTIMS
FROM THE NEXT CROWD-HACK ATTACK?
I HAVE SOME SAMPLES
FOR YOU GUYS.
ARE YOU GONNA GET
YOUR WALLET BACK?
[ LAUGHING ]
ROBERT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Gilpin: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
KEVIN.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: WHAT IS
THE SignalVault?
IS IT THE CARD?
THE SignalVault
IS THE ACTUAL DEVICE, YES,
AND IT IS A COMBINATION
OF COMPONENTS
THAT BASICALLY MASK
YOUR CREDIT-CARD INFORMATION
FROM ANY TYPE OF SCANNER.
BUT HOW DO I APPLY IT?
YOU WOULD JUST SIMPLY
TAKE THE SignalVault,
AND YOU WOULD ACTUALLY
JUST PLACE THAT IN YOUR WALLET,
NEAR YOUR CARDS.
YOU'VE GOT A CHIP IN HERE.
YES.
AND HOW DOES THE CHIP
GET ACTIVATED?
IT DETECTS A SIGNAL
FROM A SCANNER.
FOR EXAMPLE,
IF SOMEONE WALKS PAST YOU,
AND THAT ACTUALLY POWERS
THE CHIP IN THE SignalVault.
I HAVE A QUESTION.
Cuban: SO, TELL US
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.
HOW MANY ARE YOU SELLING?
WHAT'S YOUR REVENUES? ET CETERA.
OKAY, SO, I STARTED THE COMPANY
A YEAR AND NINE MONTHS AGO.
MM-HMM.
AND WE'VE SOLD
ROUGHLY 45,000 OF THEM,
SELLING THEM
MAINLY ON MY WEBSITE.
WHAT DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
SELL THEM FOR $14.95.
AND WHAT
DO THEY COST YOU?
COST ME 75 CENTS TO MAKE THEM.
MY MAN!
[ LAUGHTER ]
GREAT MARGINS.
Greiner: IT'S A GREAT MARGIN.
TODAY,
YOU'VE SOLD 45,000 CARDS.
SO, WHAT ARE
YOUR TOTAL SALES SO FAR?
RIGHT OVER $300,000.
Kutcher: HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU
INVESTED IN THIS COMPANY?
OKAY, SO, I'VE INVESTED $1
INTO THIS COMPANY.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, NO. [ LAUGHS ]
OKAY,
AND LET ME EXPLAIN.
WHEN I FIRST HAD THE IDEA
FOR THIS,
I TOLD MY FIANCÈE THAT I THOUGHT
I WOULD NEED ABOUT $8,000
TO CREATE THE PROTOTYPE.
AND IN JULY OF 2013,
I PURCHASED A LOTTERY TICKET.
[ LAUGHS ]
I REALIZED I HAD HIT
FIVE OUT OF SIX NUMBERS
IN THE FLORIDA LOTTO,
AND I WON $8,000.
YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S A TEMPLATE
FOR EVERYBODY TO FOLLOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S THE VOLUME
OF THIS THEFT CURRENTLY?
WELL, WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEING
$8 BILLION IN LOSSES EVERY YEAR
IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE U.S. ACCOUNTS FOR HALF
OF THE CREDIT-
AND DEBIT-CARD FRAUD WORLDWIDE.
WHAT PERCENT
OF MARKET SHARE
DOES YOUR COMPETITOR HAVE
COMPARED TO WHAT YOU HAVE?
I.D. STRONGHOLD
IS THE MONSTER IN THE SPACE.
HE PROBABLY HAS 80%.
TO ME, THIS IS ABOUT GETTING A
BRAND THAT GIVES IT CREDIBILITY.
SO, IN MY SPACE,
I DO MUTUAL FUNDS.
THAT'S ALL
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY
AND COMPLIANCE
WITH REGULATORS AND A BRAND.
IT'S TRUST. PEOPLE TRUST ME.
I'M VERY TRUSTWORTHY.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
I LIKE YOUR DEAL, BUT YOU'RE NOT
OFFERING ME ENOUGH.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
200K --
I WOULD DO YOUR DEAL FOR 20%.
AND I'LL ENDORSE
THIS TECHNOLOGY
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO INVEST WITH ME.
Greiner:
LISTEN, CHRIS.
THIS IS WHAT I THINK I COULD DO
IN ONE MONTH ALONE ON QVC
WITH THIS ITEM.
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
I WOULD LIKE TO
GO 200K FOR 18%.
LORI, I LOVE YOUR OFFER.
UM, I, UH -- I JUST WORKED
REALLY HARD TO GET HERE, AND --
WHAT'S YOUR COUNTER?
UM, I WOULD FIRST LOVE
TO HEAR MAYBE ASHTON OUT.
Kutcher: I'LL CLEAN UP
THE SLATE FOR YOU.
I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS
GREAT, BUT I THINK IT'S A RACE.
I THINK YOUR COMPETITOR HAS MOST
OF THE MARKET SHARE RIGHT NOW,
AND THEY PROBABLY
HAVE MORE CAPITAL
TO PUT BEHIND THAT
AND DRIVE IT OUT,
AND SO I'M GONNA STEP
OUT OF THIS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, ASHTON.
I OFFERED YOU $200,000
FOR 20%.
AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.
THE -- THE TROUBLE IS,
THE LONGER I LISTEN,
THE LESS INTERESTED
I'M GETTING,
SO YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION
AT SOME POINT.
NO, YOU DON'T.
I AM MAKING MINE 15%
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE IT...
DISCOUNT BRANDING.
...BUT I REALLY WANT YOU
TO SEE THE VALUE OF ME, AS WELL,
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO SAY YES.
MY GOAL IS TO JUST MAKE
SignalVault A HOUSEHOLD NAME.
THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU.
[ SIGHS ]
I CAN DO THAT
WITH LIGHTNING SPEED.
I THINK ANY SHARK
CAN DO THAT FOR YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WITH A BRAND
THAT MAKES SENSE.
AND I THINK I MADE YOU
A REALLY GOOD OFFER.
I DON'T -- THIS IS TIED
TO FINANCIAL SERVICES.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.
NO, IT'S NOT.
NO, IT'S NOT.
I'M NOT GONNA --
I'M NOT GONNA DISCOUNT MY DEAL,
BY THE WAY.
THIS IS A CONSUMER PLAY,
AND I'M A CONSUMER PERSON.
I'M GONNA STAY RIGHT
WHERE I AM BECAUSE YOU
GOT TO PAY MORE FOR ME.
I'M SORRY.
Herjavec: CHRIS -- SO, CHRIS,
I'M VERY INTERESTED.
I SEE
AN ENTIRE SECURITY BRAND.
I HAVE A GREAT
SECURITY BRAND.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
FOR CHRIS' CREDIT-CARD
SECURITY PRODUCT, SignalVault,
BUT INTERNET-SECURITY EXPERT
ROBERT HERJAVEC
IS ALSO INTERESTED.
Herjavec: I SEE
A TWO-PRONG STRATEGY.
I LOVE THE IDEA
OF BEING ON A QVC.
I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH HSN.
WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD BRANDS
AROUND IT.
I HAVE THE LARGEST
PRIVATELY HELD
ENTERPRISE SECURITY COMPANY
IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
I'LL DO THE $200,000
FOR 15%.
WE'LL GET ON THAT PATH TO
BRING IT INTO THE DATA CENTERS
IN ORDER TO OFFER A BIGGER SER--
IT'S DIFFERENT.
NO, IT'S -- IT'S --
IT'S DIFFERENT.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO.
YOU NEED TO BLITZ THE MARKET.
YOU NEED TO GO ALL OVER.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
IT'S SO POWERFUL TO BE
ON QVC WITH TONS OF --
THIS IS -- THIS IS MILES AWAY
FROM LORI'S BRAND.
ROBERT HAS A CREDIBLE
BRANDING ON THIS --
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
BUT, FRANKLY, IN FINANCIAL
SERVICES, I'M THE KING.
YOU SHOULD NOT
EVEN BE TALKING.
NO, I SHOULD BE BECAUSE YOUR
DEAL'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, LORI.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
I SMELL THE DEATH OF YOUR DEAL.
I -- NO.
I CAN TELL THAT
HE SEES THE MERIT OF ME.
NOT REALLY.
AND, WAIT, I'M GONNA TELL YOU.
ALLSTATE AND STATE FARM, I'M --
YES. YES, LORI,
'CAUSE HE CAN SEE
HOW THIS IS RELATED
TO A LIPSTICK BOX.
MY GOD!
I GET THAT I'M COMPETING
WITH ROBERT.
HE'S OUR ONLINE SECURITY EXPERT
FOR ENTERPRISE,
BUT I HAVE TO BE GIVEN
SOME CREDIT
FOR THE FINANCIAL-SERVICES BRAND
I HAVE IN AMERICA.
I'M THE ONLY GUY THAT ACTUALLY
SELLS TO CONSUMERS RIGHT NOW
UNDER MY OWN NAME.
THAT'S WHY MY BRAND WORKS.
SO I'D LOOK AT THIS AND SAY...
I SELL TO CONSUMERS
UNDER MY OWN NAME, TOO.
...YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY
CONSIDER WHAT I'M OFFERING YOU.
I'M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
EVERY OFFER.
IT'S $200,000 FOR 20%.
Greiner: WELL, ANYWAY,
TO FINISH WHAT I WAS SAYING
WHEN I WAS SO RUDELY
INTERRUPTED --
ALL RIGHT,
YOU HAVE $200,000 FOR 15%,
$200,000 FOR 15%,
$200,000...
15%.
...FOR 20%.
YEAH.
AND?
Cuban: AND PLUS, LOOK,
WHAT I'VE SEEN IN MY EXPERIENCE
IS THAT COMPANIES THAT COME OUT
WITH A CONSUMER PRODUCT
AND THINK THEIR MONEY
IS GONNA BE MADE IN ENTERPRISE
DON'T REALIZE HOW EXPENSIVE
AND HOW LONG IT TAKES.
AND SO I THINK
YOU'RE UNDER-PLAYING
JUST HOW DIFFICULT
THAT WILL BE.
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
Greiner: YOU HAVE
SUCH A SIMPLE PRODUCT
THAT YOU COULD HAVE PEOPLE
OUT IN FORCE SELLING IT.
YES.
YOU COULD HAVE QVC,
BED BATH &amp; BEYOND,
TARGET,
ALL THE DIFFERENT RETAILERS.
YOU COULD HAVE
YOUR ONLINE.
YOU COULD HAVE PROMOTIONS.
YES.
YOU COULD GO
TO INSURANCE COMPANIES.
AND EVERY SHARK
CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.
YOU COULD DO IT ALL.
WE ALL DO IT.
BUT -- BUT I WILL DO IT
THE BEST.
CHRIS,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
ROBERT, YOU ARE DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE SHARKS
THAT I WANTED TO WORK WITH.
AND, LORI, OF COURSE,
YOUR CONNECTIONS WITH QVC ARE --
ARE, YOU KNOW...
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON THAT.
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU GUYS
TO WORK TOGETHER.
IF YOU GOT TWO SHARKS,
WHAT'S YOUR COUNTER?
MY COUNTER IS...
CHRIS,
IF YOU WANT US BOTH,
YOU NEED TO OFFER BACK
BETTER EQUITY THAN 18%.
Herjavec: THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF WORK.
THIS IS WHAT OUR TEAM DOES.
I THINK WE'RE WORTH IT.
I'M -- I'M WILLING
TO DO THAT.
I-I'M DEFINITELY WILLING
TO ADD --
WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE EQUITY
THAT YOU WOULD GO UP TO?
I WILL DO...
$200,000 FOR 25%,
BOTH OF YOU.
I'LL DO IT. WILL YOU?
I'M IN. DONE.
YAY! I LOVE IT!
DON'T BE SO NERVOUS!
[ LAUGHS ]
Greiner: I LOVE IT.
WE'RE GONNA
BLOW THIS OUT.
GO CELEBRATE.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
GOOD LUCK.
CONGRATULATIONS, CHRIS.
YES!
STRIKING A DEAL
WITH ROBERT AND LORI --
THEY ARE MY DREAM SHARKS.
I KNOW THAT WE ARE DESTINED
FOR HUGE THINGS.
