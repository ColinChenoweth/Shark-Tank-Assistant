SHARKS,
MY NAME IS TYLER HADZICKI,
MY COMPANY
IS LEAUX RACING TRIKES,
AND I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING
$120,000
TYLER,
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
YOU'RE SO LOW,
YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE GOING
A MILLION MILES AN HOUR.
LEAUX RACING TRIKES.
RIGHT.
THEY'RE SO LOW.
DID YOU CREATE THIS
YOURSELF?
SO, THIS STARTED OFF
A LONG TIME AGO,
AS A 6th-GRADE SCIENCE PROJECT.
THE TEACHER HATED THE IDEA
BECAUSE IT WASN'T
"SCIENTIFIC" ENOUGH.
BUT THEN WHEN I WON FIRST PLACE
AT THE SAN DIEGO SCIENCE FAIR,
I GUESS SHE HAD TO EAT IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU WON THE AWARD?
WELL, I HAVE THE FIRST PICTURE
OF THE ORIGINAL TRICYCLE HERE,
AND WHAT I DID WAS
I WENT TO THE SWAP MEET,
AND I WAS CUTTING UP TRIKES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, THAT'S PROTOTYPE ONE.
THAT'S PROTOTYPE ONE.
THAT WON A SCIENCE FAIR.
YOU'VE IMPROVED IT A LOT.
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GO FROM
THERE TO THIS?
ABOUT FOUR YEARS.
ARE YOU IN COLLEGE?
I'M A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE.
NOW YOU TRY TO BRING IT
TO MARKET.
KICKSTARTER --
A CROWD-FUNDING PLATFORM.
WHAT WAS YOUR TARGET?
MY TARGET WAS $15,000.
RAISED $46,000, SO 300% OF MY
GOAL, WHICH WAS PRETTY COOL.
THERE WAS 130 ORDERS.
I PRODUCED THOSE
ALL AT MY FACILITY.
I GOT THOSE SHIPPED OUT
OVER THAT YEAR.
WHERE'S YOUR FACILITY?
WE WENT TO MEXICO
AND SET UP A FACILITY THERE
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
BUILDING BMX BIKES FOR A WHILE.
SO I'M AN INTERNATIONAL
BUSINESSMAN UNDER THE AGE OF 18
WITH THREE PATENTS
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.
[ CHUCKLES ]
GOOD FOR YOU.
AND WHAT DID YOU CHARGE
PER UNIT?
WHAT WAS YOUR COST?
THESE ARE $350.
COST ON THESE
IS ABOUT $170-$180 TO MAKE IT.
THESE ARE PRETTY MUCH HAND MADE.
WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS,
I DON'T LIKE MAKING
A WHOLE BUNCH OF THESE,
BECAUSE I HAND-TEST
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
SO YOU WERE NERVOUS.
I GO DOWN TO MEXICO.
I HAVE TO SPEND, YOU KNOW,
EIGHT HOURS A DAY
TESTING A BATCH OF 40.
THAT'S HOW I DO THEM.
OH, SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE
AN INSPECTOR.
RIDE THEM ALL, PACK THEM ALL,
MAKE SURE THIS PAINT'S
POWDER COATED CORRECTLY --
I DON'T WANT ANY BAD PRODUCTS
GOING TO THE CUSTOMER,
'CAUSE IT REFLECTS POORLY ON ME.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SELL
10,000 OF THESE?
I CAN RENT THE LARGER FACILITY,
THEN I CAN HIRE THE LABOR.
THERE ARE FACILITIES
IN MEXICO AND IN ASIA
THAT MAKE MILLIONS OF BIKES.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU SIMPLY
GO TO ONE OF THEM
AND SAY, "LOOK, I WANT TO GET
10,000 OF THESE MADE BY YOU."
WELL, AN EASY THING, THOUGH,
IS YOU CAN HIRE AN INSPECTOR.
THERE ARE SEVERAL
VERY CREDIBLE SERVICES
LIKE BUREAU VERITAS...
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT,
DEFINITELY.
...WHERE THEY CAN GO DOWN,
HAVE A PROTOCOL,
AND THEY CAN'T SHIP
UNTIL THOSE ARE CHECKED
AND THE INSPECTION'S DONE.
DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY.
NO, ALL THESE THINGS
ARE COMING IN PLACE.
O'Leary:
IS THERE A DEMAND FOR TENS --
NO, BUT LET HIM SPEAK
A MOMENT.
BUT I NEED -- I WANT TO TEST
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
WHY?
Corcoran: YOU DON'T
WANT TO LET THAT GO.
YOU WANT TO BE
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR EACH AND EVERY BIKE.
THAT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT IT'S A NICHE --
IT'S A NICHE PRODUCT
BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
AT THIS POINT
THAT I'M ABLE TO.
THEN YOU GOT TO RAISE
YOUR PRICE SIGNIFICANTLY.
THEN YOU GOT TO RAISE
YOUR PRICE SIGNIFICANTLY.
RIGHT.
TYLER,
LET ME ASK YOU THIS --
LET ME UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHO BUYS THESE.
IT'S USUALLY
PARENTS FOR THEIR KIDS,
WHICH ARE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
9 TO 16, AROUND THERE.
AND THEN ALSO
IT'S THE ADULT GUY, KIND OF.
ROBERT.
I THINK YOU'RE A TERRIFIC KID --
OH, MAN, I SHOULD SAY.
YOU LOVE YOUR PRODUCT,
BUT I DON'T SEE
THIS AS INVESTABLE.
IT'S VERY EARLY
IN THE GAME.
I THINK YOU HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO
BEFORE YOU GET
AN INVESTMENT.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, BARBARA.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, TYLER.
I-I DON'T SEE THIS
AS AN INVESTMENT FOR ME,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW I'D
TURN THIS INTO A HUGE BUSINESS.
I'M NOT SURE <i>YOU</i> KNOW YET.
BUT I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, KEVIN,
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
TYLER, YOU ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE
OF AN ENTREPRENEUR.
ONE OF THE THINGS I FIND
VERY ADMIRABLE
IS THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.
ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT,
THOUGH, YOU'RE ONE PERSON.
YOU CAN'T GO
AND STAND IN THE FACTORY
AND WATCH 40 MADE AT A TIME.
I PERSONALLY SEE IT
AS A LICENSING DEAL,
BECAUSE I DO THINK,
TO SCALE, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A BIG COMPANY
THAT CAN DO EXACTLY THAT.
RIGHT.
I THINK THAT'S
A BIT OF A WAYS AWAY.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
TYLER, INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE
FOR ANYBODY AT ANY AGE.
AT YOUR AGE, DOUBLY IMPRESSIVE
WHERE YOU'VE GOTTEN.
NO ONE DOUBTS YOU.
I DOUBT WHAT THE MARKET IS.
TYLER, LOOK,
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.
BUT I-I HAVE TO SEE
A VISION FROM YOU, RIGHT,
THAT TAKES IT SO IT CAN BE
A MUCH BIGGER COMPANY.
BUT, FOR RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T SEE IT, TYLER.
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
BRILLIANT IDEA, THOUGH.
THANK YOU.
I'M GONNA SELL
A LOT ON MY WEBSITE
AND TO THE BIG BOX,
SO THAT'S FINE.
WE HOPE YOU DO.
GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Corcoran: THANK YOU.
I'M A LITTLE BUMMED THAT
THEY COULDN'T SEE MY VISION.
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S A TOY,
AND THE FACT THAT THEY WOULDN'T
EVEN CONSIDER OR LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY
ABOUT THE MARKET
WAS JUST RUDE, ALMOST.
JUST RUDE. [ CHUCKLES ]
