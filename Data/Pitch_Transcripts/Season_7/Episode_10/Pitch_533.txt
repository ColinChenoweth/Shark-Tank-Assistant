IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SPIN
INTO THE TANK LIKE THAT
FOR A LONG TIME.
THAT'S THE KIND
OF EXCITEMENT YOU GET
WHEN YOU RIDE ONE OF MY TRIKES.
IT'S LIKE A RACECAR
AND A TRICYCLE HAD A LOVE CHILD.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WITH THREE WHEELS,
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET
STABILITY AND SPEED,
BUT INCREDIBLE AGILITY, AS WELL.
THE REAR WHEELS ARE CASTERS
THAT CAN BE CONTROLLED MANUALLY
WITH THIS HANDLE TO TAKE
TIGHT CORNERS, DRIFT,
AND EVEN SPIN 360 DEGREES.
SHARKS, THIS IS NOT
JUST AN ADULT TRICYCLE,
THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE
UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE.
I'M READY TO TAKE THIS
TO THE WORLD.
NOW, WHO WANTS TO COME ALONG
FOR THIS CRAZY RIDE?
I GOT TO TRY IT.
IS THERE ANY CERTAIN AGE
FOR IT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, LORI?
YOUNG AT HEART.
I HAVE TWO MORE BACK HERE.
OH, COME ON, MARK.
I'LL RACE YOU.
KEVIN, JOIN THEM.
YOU HAVE ONE
BIG ENOUGH FOR MARK?
OF COURSE.
THESE ARE FULLY ADJUSTABLE.
I GOT A BIG-ASS HEAD.
THEY STILL DON'T FIT.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
THEY'RE NOT BUMPER CARS.
THEY ARE NOW.
OH!
OOH.
KEVIN, YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY
THAT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE RIDING
A LITTLE TRICYCLE.
SPEED UP.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THEY'RE SUPER DURABLE.
YOU CAN CRASH INTO EACH OTHER.
OH, MY GOD.
OH!
[ LAUGHS ]
THERE YOU GO, MARK.
PERFECT.
WA-HOO-HOO!
OH!
HOW DID YOU WIPE OUT?
[ SIGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
I LOVED IT.
LORI,
YOU GOT TO TRY IT.
I'D LOVE TO TRY IT.
I'M IN A SKIRT.
NOT SO EASY
ON THE BUMPS.
THAT WAS COOL.
IF IT'S A TRICYCLE,
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE DESIGN.
IT'S TOO HARD-CORE FOR GENERAL
DISTRIBUTION FOR KIDS TO USE.
IF IT'S NICHE,
FOR HARD-CORE PEOPLE LIKE ME
THAT LOVE SPEED, OR OLDER KIDS,
IT'S TOO CHEAP.
I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG
THAT MARKET IS.
BUT I THINK THERE'S
LOADS OF TOYS IN THIS SPACE
THAT ARE THE KID-FRIENDLY,
RIDE-IT-IN-YOUR-DRIVEWAY
KIND OF THING,
AND I THINK IT FITS THERE.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A BRILLIANT GUY.
YOU'RE GONNA INVENT
SOMETHING ELSE.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS ONE
FITS OR HOW I CAN HELP YOU.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
Cuban: WHAT'S
YOUR NEXT PRODUCT, TYLER?
MY NEXT PRODUCT?
THE REASON I ASKED
ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT...
MM-HMM.
...IS THIS --
I DON'T SEE THIS AS, YOU KNOW,
SELLING TWO MILLION UNITS.
YEAH.
DEFINITELY.
RIGHT?
SO IF I'M INVESTING
IN YOUR COMPANY,
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING NEXT,
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE
THE INVESTMENT
SO WE CAN GET
SOMEPLACE ELSE TOGETHER --
SOMEPLACE BIGGER AND BETTER.
SO, I THINK THERE'S LOTS
OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO WITH,
YOU KNOW, ADD-ONS, ALL THAT
CUSTOMIZATION KINDS OF THINGS.
THOSE WILL INCREASE YOUR
BUSINESS ON THE MARGIN.
THAT'S NOT GONNA TAKE YOU
TO A $25 MILLION COMPANY.
I MEAN, THE SCOOTER SELLS
SEVEN MILLION UNITS IN ONE YEAR.
ONE YEAR.
BUT THAT APPLIES
TO EVERYBODY.
AND IT GETS YOU FROM POINT "A"
TO POINT "B", AND IT'S FUN.
AND I'M CHRISTINE CHANG.
AND WE'RE FROM NEW YORK CITY.
WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF GLOW RECIPE,
AND TODAY WE'RE SEEKING
$425,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR
10% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
GLOW RECIPE IS HERE TODAY
TO MAKE EVERY
AMERICAN WOMAN'S SKIN GLOW
AND MAKE EVERYONE
LOOK BEAUTIFUL
BY BRINGING ONLY THE BEST
PRODUCTS AND SKIN SECRETS
FROM THE MODERN EPICENTER
OF ADVANCED SKIN INNOVATION --
KOREA.
KOREA.
SHARKS, DID YOU KNOW,
IN THE LAST YEAR,
THE TOP U.S. BEAUTY EDITORS
AND MEDIA OUTLETS
HAVE BEEN
CROWNING KOREAN BEAUTY
TO BE 12 YEARS AHEAD
OF THE REST OF THE WORLD?
WITH GLOW RECIPE, KOREAN BEAUTY
IS NO LONGER A HIDDEN SECRET.
WE BELIEVE
THAT KOREAN BEAUTY
CAN BE THE NEXT BIG PLAYER
IN THE U.S.
NOW, WE KNOW THAT BEING
A SHARK ISN'T EASY.
YOU'RE STRESSED,
SLEEP-DEPRIVED,
DEALING WITH THE PRESSURES
OF BEING AN APEX PREDATOR...
[ LAUGHS ]
WE WANTED BRING A LITTLE BIT
OF GLOW INTO YOUR DAY
AND ON TO YOUR FACES,
SO WE HAVE SOME SAMPLES FOR YOU.
I HOPE IT'S WHISKEY.
[ LAUGHS ]
OKAY.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
Herjavec:
THANK YOU, LADIES.
THANK YOU.
MR. WONDERFUL.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.
Chang: SO, THE FIRST
IS A WATERLESS MIST
THAT IS PACKED WITH BOTANICAL
EXTRACTS FOR EXTRA EFFICACY.
PERFECT FOR
ON-THE-GO, 24/7 SKIN CARE --
ESPECIALLY PERFECT FOR SHARKS
THAT NEVER STOP SWIMMING.
OH, IT'S NICE.
SECOND IS PRESSED SERUM.
THIS IS A NEW CATEGORY
IN BEAUTY
THAT COMBINES
THE CONCENTRATION OF A SERUM
AND THE COMFORTING HYDRATION
OF A MOISTURIZER.
SO THIS MULTI-TASKER
IS PACKED WITH
CHAGA MUSHROOM EXTRACT,
WHICH IS ANTI-AGING.
OH, IT FEELS FUNNY.
IT'S LIKE A HALFWAY BETWEEN
A GEL AND A CREAM.
EXACTLY.
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.
SO, LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
THIS IS THE NEXT GENERATION
SEA-KELP SHEET MASK.
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD,
SHEET MASKS ARE ON FIRE
IN THE U.S., AND YOU MIGHT HAVE
SEEN THE COTTON SHEET MASKS.
YEAH, I KNEW THAT.
OF COURSE.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, SHARKS, WE WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO JOIN US
ON OUR JOURNEY TO MAKING
THE WORLD MORE BEAUTIFUL...
AND GLOW WITH US.
AND GLOW WITH US.
JUST TO BE CLEAR, LADIES.
YOU DON'T MAKE THESE PRODUCTS.
YOU SOURCE THEM IN KOREA
AND YOU BRING THEM
TO THE UNITED STATES.
EXACTLY.
WE'RE AN E-RETAILER. YES.
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY
A DISTRIBUTOR.
SO, OUR BUSINESS
IS IN TWO VERTICALS.
ONE IS AN E-COMMERCE SITE,
WHERE WE CURATE THE NATURAL
BEAUTY SKIN CARE PRODUCTS
FROM KOREA.
OH, YOU'RE A CURATOR.
WE CURATE THEM
BASED ON OUR EXPERTISE.
WE HAVE 20-PLUS YEARS
OF COMBINED EXPERIENCE
IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST
BEAUTY COMPANY -- L'ORÈAL.
YOU HAVE 20-PLUS YEARS?
COMBINED.
COMBINED.
SO, YOU MUST HAVE
HUGE SALES,
BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING
A VALUE ON YOUR BUSINESS
OF OVER $4 MILLION.
SO...
LET'S HEAR ABOUT
THOSE SALES.
LAST YEAR, WE OPENED
GLOW RECIPE IN NOVEMBER.
FOR THE FIRST TWO MONTHS,
OUR REVENUE WAS $3,000.
2015, YEAR-TO-DATE,
WE'RE AT $550,000.
WOW.
AND WE'RE PROJECTED TO DO
$1 MILLION
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.
CHRISTINE, WHAT IS
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF EQUITY
YOU'D BE WILLING TO PART WITH
FOR $425,000?
MAYBE WE CAN GET TO
AN ANSWER VERY QUICKLY,
BECAUSE NOBODY'S WILLING
TO GIVE YOU THE DEAL AT 10%.
WELL, MARK MIGHT.
NO, I WOULDN'T DO IT --
I WOULDN'T DO IT AT 10%.
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO,
MARK?
YEAH, WE'D LOVE
TO HEAR FROM YOU, MARK.
[ LAUGHS ]
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DON'T KNOW.
O'Leary:
MARK, THROW IT OUT THERE.
WELL, THEN GO OUT!
YEAH, REALLY.
OKAY, CHRISTINE.
OKAY NOW.
SO, ROBERT, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO CONSIDER...
18%?
18%?
CHRISTINE,
WOULD YOU DO IT AT 25%?
ROBERT, WOULD YOU DO IT
AT 22.5%? [ CHUCKLES ]
IF IT'S WORTH 25%,
IT'S WORTH 22.5%.
I'VE COME DOWN.
I THINK THAT'S FAIR.
I'D LOVE
TO BE INVOLVED WITH YOU.
I WOULD DEFINITELY DO IT
AT 25%.
[ WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY ]
ROBERT AND MARK, IF YOU WOULD
COME TOGETHER AT 25%,
WE WOULD BE WILLING
TO TAKE THE OFFER.
GUESS THEY DON'T LIKE US.
IF YOU WANT ANOTHER SHARK,
THEN THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY'S
GOT TO GO UP
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I'M HAPPY TO DO A DEAL ALONE --
$425,000 FOR 25%.
I DON'T THINK I NEED
ANOTHER SHARK.
I'VE GOT THE TECH, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
[ SPEAKING KOREAN ]
THEY CAN JUST TALK IN KOREAN.
WE WON'T UNDERSTAND THEM.
[ LAUGHS ]
YES.
THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE'D LIKE TO ACCEPT
YOUR OFFER.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
OH, MY, YOU GUYS.
OH, THANK YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
ROBERT.
YEAH. THANK YOU.
GOOD JOB.
THANK YOU.
SO, SHARKS,
WE WANTED TO JUST
BRIEFLY TELL YOU "THANK YOU"
IN KOREAN.
GOMAPSEUMNIDA.
GOMAPSEUMNIDA.
GOMAPSEUMNIDA?
YES.
HOW DO I SAY,
"SCREW YOU, KEVIN" IN KOREAN.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, NO.
OH.
PLEASE, DON'T BE RUDE.
[ LAUGHS ]
Cuban:
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
THEY'RE NICE GIRLS.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SAY IT.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: THANK YOU.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
OH, MY GOD!
OUR MINDS ARE BLOWN. WE'RE SO
EXCITED FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
WE'RE -- WE HAVE A DEAL
WITH A SHARK!
WITH ROBERT!
Narrator: IN SEASON 5,
PAT YATES STRUCK A DEAL
WITH ROBERT HERJAVEC FOR HIS
SLIPPER COMPANY, HAPPY FEET.
$375,000...
WAIT.
...25%,
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
WAIT.
DONE.
LET'S SEE
WHAT HE'S UP TO NOW.
Yates: MORNING, MICHELLE.
MORNING, TIFF.
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ROBERT
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF,
AND AMAZING THINGS ARE HAPPENING
FOR HAPPY FEET.
THE YEAR BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
I HAD $2.65 MILLION IN SALES.
SINCE "SHARK TANK," I'VE DONE
$4.2 MILLION IN SALES.
BOOM.
AND THE SITE'S LIVE.
[ CHEERING ]
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROJECTS
WE'VE UNDERTAKEN
IS A MASSIVE OVERHAUL
OF THE HAPPY FEET WEBSITE.
WE'VE MOVED INTO A NEW OFFICE
AND HAVE 16 EMPLOYEES.
BUT THE MOST EXCITING THING
IS DreamWorks ANIMATION
HAS REACHED OUT TO US ABOUT
A LICENSING OPPORTUNITY.
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A GREAT WAY
TO GET HAPPY FEET INTO RETAIL,
BUT I REALLY WANT TO HEAR
ROBERT'S TAKE ON IT, AS WELL.
HEY, ROBERT.
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Herjavec: LICENSING DEALS
ARE A PERFECT FIT
FOR A COMPANY LIKE HAPPY FEET.
IT'S LIKE RENTING
SOMEBODY ELSE'S BRAND
AND TAKING IT OUT
INTO THE WORLD.
THEY HAVE NEW MOVIES
COMING OUT ALL THE TIME,
THEY HAVE NEW CHARACTERS.
AND WHO WOULDN'T LOVE
A SHREK SLIPPER?
THE CHALLENGE WITH ANY PRODUCT
IS DISTRIBUTION, TYPICALLY.
IF WE CAN PIVOT INTO CREATING
CHARACTERS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS,
THIS COULD BE
A TENS-OF-MILLIONS-OF-DOLLARS
BUSINESS.
ENOUGH TALKING.
LET'S GO DO IT.
I LOVE IT. LET'S DO IT.
ALL RIGHT.
Yates:
MAKING A DEAL ON "SHARK TANK"
HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED
MY BUSINESS.
WITH ROBERT ON BOARD, WE HAVE
A LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY NOW
THAT WE COULD'VE NEVER ACHIEVED
WITHOUT HIM.
WE'RE NOT JUST SELLING SLIPPERS,
WE'RE SELLING FUN.
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
MAKING EVEN MORE PEOPLE HAPPY
WITH HAPPY FEET.
All: HAPPY FEET!
[ CHEERING ]
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY.
IT'S NO SECRET
THAT WOMEN LOVE HANDBAGS.
BUT HOW MANY OF THOSE BAGS
COME WITH MEANING?
IF ONLY THE HANDS THAT MADE
THOSE BAGS COULD TALK.
WELL, NOW THEY CAN.
I WOULD SAY YES BEFORE
SOMEONE CHANGES THEIR MIND.
I -- I LOVE IT.
I WANTED TO HEAR
FROM MR. WONDERFUL.
[ SIGHS ]
KEVIN?
OKAY, THE ONLY WAY THIS HAPPENS
IS YOU GO TO 30%,
'CAUSE I WANT 10%.
I DON'T GET UP IN THE MORNING
FOR LESS THAN THAT,
AND I'LL JOIN THEM.
WELL, IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU
TO HAVE HIM IN?
ALL RIGHT. I'M IN.
I'M IN ON THAT.
I'M SORRY.
EXPLAIN THAT AGAIN.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU'RE GOING BACKWARDS.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S JUST WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
YOU'RE GOING BACKWARDS.
THIS -- THIS --
IT'S A BUSINESS, OKAY.
ABSOLUTELY.
BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING
THE PURLETTES,
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
TO MAKE THIS WORK,
IF ALL OF THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN,
YOU HAVE TO INCREASE
YOUR CAPACITY BY FOUR TIMES.
ALL RIGHT?
CORRECT.
SO...
WHICH YOU WILL.
WHICH YOU WILL.
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME WORK
INVOLVED FROM EACH SHARK.
MM-HMM.
AND I GENERALLY DON'T DO DEALS
FOR LESS THAN 10% EQUITY.
WHY?
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.
MM-HMM.
IF YOU REALLY WANT ME
IN THIS DEAL,
I'LL JOIN THEM
1/3, 1/3, 1/3.
WE'LL GIVE YOU
THE $250,000.
YOU HAVE TO PART
WITH 30%.
I'M OKAY IF YOU JUST
GO WITH THESE TWO GUYS, TOO.
AND WE'RE SEEKING $1.4 MILLION
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5%.
WOW.
[ O'LEARY CHUCKLES ]
WOW.
SHARKS, MEET TRUNKSTER,
THE WORLD'S FIRST AND ONLY
ROLL-TOP SUITCASE.
TRUNKSTER'S MINIMALIST
ROLL-TOP DOOR
PROVIDES INSTANT ACCESS
TO YOUR BELONGINGS,
WHETHER IN THE BACK OF A TAXI
OR AT THE CHECK-IN COUNTER,
YOU'RE JUST
A QUICK SLIDE AWAY
FROM YOUR PASSPORT, BOOK,
OR SWEATER.
AND THAT'S
JUST THE BEGINNING.
TRUNKSTER'S LOADED
WITH SMART FEATURES.
WE'VE ENGINEERED
THE WORLD'S FIRST
SELF-CONTAINED HANDLE SCALE,
SO YOU CAN PACK JUST UNDER
THE WEIGHT LIMIT
AND AVOID COSTLY FEES.
SHARKS,
IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE
THAN RUNNING OUT OF POWER
ON THE GO?
WITH TRUNKSTER,
YOU'VE GOT JUICE ALL TO YOURSELF
VIA THE BUILT-IN USB PORTS
POWERED BY A REMOVABLE BATTERY.
AND FORGET ABOUT
LOST-LUGGAGE NIGHTMARES,
'CAUSE TRUNKSTER OFFERS
GLOBAL LOCATION TRACKING
WITH PROXIMITY SENSORS.
TRUNKSTER GIVES YOU
ALL OF THIS,
PLUS IT'S MADE FROM
THE HIGHEST-QUALITY MATERIALS,
USING A PATENT-PENDING
ASSEMBLY PROCESS
FOR LIGHTWEIGHT
AND RIGID DURABILITY.
NOT TO MENTION
HOW SEXY IT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS THE BIGGEST
LUGGAGE INNOVATION
SINCE WHEELS WERE ADDED
50 YEARS AGO,
AND WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO ESTABLISH OURSELVES
AS THE GAME-CHANGING
LUGGAGE BRAND WORLDWIDE.
SO, WHO'S IN?
YOU GONNA SHOW US
THE PRODUCT?
JUST TO PREFACE,
THE INSIDES OF THESE --
HOW DO YOU OPEN IT?
OH, YOU CAN JUST PRESS
THIS BUTTON VERY GENTLY...
JUST PULL IT OUT THERE.
...AND IT'LL SLIDE DOWN.
YOU CAN OPEN IT STANDING UP
OR LAYING DOWN,
Greiner: OH.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.
[ BANGING ]
CAN THIS REALLY
TAKE A HIT?
YEAH.
ONE, IT'S VERY SLEEK,
BUT IT'S EXTREMELY MASCULINE.
PRODUCT LINE EXPANSION.
WE'RE THINKING NEW COLORS.
IT WOULDN'T BE A PRODUCT THAT
I WOULD PICK OUT IN A STORE.
Greiner: [ CHUCKLES ] PINK.
YOU'RE DOING OTHERS, BUT I'M
JUDGING BY THIS PROTOTYPE.
SURE.
YES.
OKAY, SECONDLY, I
THINK IT'S TOO HEAVY,
IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT
MOST PEOPLE LIKE SOFT LUGGAGE,
NOT HARD LUGGAGE.
AND, LASTLY, YOU HAVEN'T HAD
YOUR CONSUMER BASE TEST IT OUT.
THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET.
SO YOU'RE ASKING US TO INVEST
A LOT OF MONEY
WITH ABSOLUTELY NO FEEDBACK
FROM THE GUY WHO'S GONNA USE IT.
WELL, WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE
TEST IT -- NOT EVERYBODY.
THE PRODUCT TESTERS CAME BACK
WITH REALLY POSITIVE REVIEWS.
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED
QUESTIONS, BUT, MAGICALLY,
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE CONVINCED ME
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $1.4 MILLION FOR 30%.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AND THAT'S A LEGITIMATE OFFER.
MARK CAN LAUGH ALL HE WANTS.
HE'S NOT MAKING AN OFFER.
THAT'S THE OFFER I SEE, BECAUSE
OF ALL THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
THIS ISN'T AN INVESTMENT,
WE'RE GOING ON A TRIP TOGETHER.
AND WHEN WE GO
ON THIS TRIP TOGETHER,
WE'RE GONNA LEARN A LOT.
IN THE SUITCASE!
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
O'Leary: BASICALLY,
ROBERT'S COMPUTING A VALUE
OF $5 MILLION ON THE DEAL.
THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING,
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR.
YOU KNOW, IN FACT, I'LL JOIN HIM
IF HE WANTS A PARTNER.
I LIKE YOU GUYS,
I'LL DO THAT DEAL.
I'LL GO 50/50 IF HE WANTS TO
MITIGATE HIS RISK A LITTLE BIT.
KEVIN,
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.
I DON'T WANT KEVIN
TO GO ON THIS TRIP WITH ME,
BECAUSE THERE ARE COUNTRIES
KEVIN'S NOT ALLOWED TO GO INTO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, I WILL MAKE
THE SAME OFFER,
EXCEPT I WANT 37%.
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE...
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THEY'LL TAKE THAT.
I'M BEING JUST AS LUDICROUS
AS YOU ARE.
YOUR VALUATION'S INSANE.
WE'D LOVE TO HEAR, MAYBE,
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE.
COULD WE HEAR OTHER OFFERS?
I'M SITTING HERE THINKING ABOUT
THE RISK, RIGHT?
LOSING MONEY.
ON THE ONE HAND,
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S
A LOT OF THAT CAN BE DONE
WITH IT, RIGHT?
I HAVE LICENSING CONNECTIONS.
I KNOW THIS WORLD VERY WELL.
BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE,
SAY I GIVE YOU THE MONEY
AND SOMETHING
GOES WRONG WITH IT, RIGHT?
YOU DON'T ANTICIPATE IT,
BUT IT COULD HAPPEN.
SO I WOULD GIVE YOU
THE $1.4 MILLION
TO FUND PURCHASE ORDERS --
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID YOU
NEEDED...
HOW MUCH EQUITY DO YOU WANT?
...AT 15%.
WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IF MARK
MAYBE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY.
THE PRODUCT'S INTERESTING.
I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.
NOW I WANT YOU TO PUT YOURSELF
IN OUR SHOES.
HOW MUCH SHOULD I GET BACK,
AND WHEN?
WE EXPECT TO BE MAKING
$6 MILLION IN NEXT YEAR.
OKAY, JUST SIMPLE QUESTION.
WE CAN PAY YOU BACK
NEXT YEAR.
IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.
BUT I DON'T WANT JUST
$1 MILLION BACK.
ABSOLUTELY.
RIGHT?
WE'RE AIMING TO MAKE
A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY.
YOU HAVE US WORKING 24/7 --
Corcoran:
YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED HIM.
GUYS, GUYS,
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
[ INHALES DEEPLY ]
IN YOUR MIND, THERE'S THESE
BIG NUMBERS YOU CAN PAY BACK.
BUT WHEN WE DO THE MATH
BASED OFF THE EQUITY
YOU'RE OFFERING US,
THE NUMBERS DON'T CALCULATE
TO BIG NUMBERS.
IF YOU MAKE, YOU KNOW,
$20 MILLION NEXT YEAR,
WHAT'S 5% OF $20 MILLION?
JUST $1 MILLION DOLLARS.
RIGHT?
SEE, YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT IT
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.
GENTLEMEN, I ALWAYS LOVE MARK
MORE THAN ANYONE ON THE PANEL,
'CAUSE HE'S GOT THE MOST BUCKS,
BUT LET ME TELL YOU,
LORI IS THE BEST PARTNER.
WOULD IT BE AN OPTION
TO WORK TOGETHER?
I WOULD NEGOTIATE.
WELL, MAY WE TAKE
JUST ONE MOMENT SPEAK?
YEAH, PLEASE DO. PLEASE DO.
NOT A BAD IDEA.
THANK YOU.
