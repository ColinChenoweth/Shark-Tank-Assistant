HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS SARAH LEE.
SO, SARAH,
ALL THOSE SALES ARE ONLINE.
SO, HALF OF THAT COMES FROM
OUR E-COMMERCE SITE,
WHERE WE CURATE THE PRODUCTS.
THE SECOND IS WHERE
WE ACT AS A BRAND INCUBATOR.
SO, OUR SITE --
AND YOU CHARGE THEM
FOR THAT SERVICE?
YES. WE SHARE THE REVENUE
WITH THE BRANDS.
BUT HOW DO PEOPLE KNOW THIS?
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE.
OF COURSE, SO,
A BIG PART OF OUR PLATFORM
IS TO NOT ONLY CURATE,
BUT ALSO EDUCATE.
WE HAVE
AN EXTREMELY DETAILED SITE
WITH WITH VERY DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS, USAGE, EVEN VIDEO.
OUR MAIN FOCUS RIGHT NOW
IS REALLY ROBUSTLY GROWING
OUR YouTube CHANNEL.
'CAUSE WE REALLY THINK VIDEO --
HOW MANY SUBSCRIBERS?
HOW MANY SUBSCRIBERS?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
OUR SUBSCRIBER BASE
IS STILL AROUND 1,000
BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED,
BUT OUR CUMULATIVE VIEWS
ARE 200,000 RIGHT NOW.
AND WE JUST STARTED.
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY --
THAT'S NOT REALLY
A LEGIT NUMBER THOUGH, RIGHT?
WE JUST STARTED, THOUGH.
EVERYBODY -- RIGHT.
WHY IS KOREA A HOTBED
OF BEAUTY PRODUCTS?
IT'S JUST
HYPER-SPEED INNOVATION.
THE MARKET
IS SO COMPETITIVE LOCALLY.
THE C.E.O. OF ESTEE LAUDER
LIKENED KOREAN'S
BEAUTY INFLUENCE
TO THE INFLUENCE OF PARIS
IN FASHION.
HOW MANY SKEWS DO YOU HAVE?
HOW MUCH INVENTORY DO YOU HAVE?
SO, RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE 110 SKEWS.
WE HAVE 110.
OKAY, SO THAT'S WHERE
YOUR CASH IS GOING THEN, RIGHT?
'CAUSE IF NEW PRODUCTS
ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME...
YES.
...YOU'RE -- YOU'RE INVENTORY
IS VERY MUCH AT RISK.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
SLOW-MOVING GOODS RIGHT NOW.
EVERYTHING IS CYCLING THROUGH
SO FAST --
WELL, UNTIL
THE NEXT ONE COMES, RIGHT?
IF KOREA HAS SO MUCH INNOVATION,
WHY WOULDN'T LARGE RETAILERS
THAT MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN SALES IN COSMETICS
NOT HAVE THOSE
IN THEIR STORES?
SO, SEPHORA OF TARGET ACTUALLY
CARRIES A FEW BRANDS.
NOT A LOT --
THEY'VE JUST STARTED.
SO, THEY'RE COMPETITORS NOW.
THEY'RE COMPETITORS, IN A WAY,
BUT THEY ACTUALLY COME TO US
TO SEEK INNOVATION TRENDS
AND IDEAS.
SO YOU'RE THINKING YOU'RE
CONSULTANTS FOR THIS INDUSTRY
IN THE UNITED STATES.
WE'RE THINKING THAT WE'RE
THE THOUGHT AND TREND LEADERS
WHEN IT COMES TO
K-BEAUTY IN THE U.S.
EXACTLY.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE SCALE
THAT YOUR COMPETITORS,
THE RETAILERS, HAVE.
WELL, OF COURSE.
THEY'RE A START-UP.
WHY CAN'T THEY HIRE
SOME GREAT TALENT?
WELL, ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
I MEAN, ANYBODY
COULD BE A DISTRIBUTOR.
YEAH, BUT HOW MANY
SARAH AND CHRISTINE'S
ARE THERE OUT THERE?
THANK YOU, MARK.
EXACTLY. THANK YOU.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE WANTED TO BRING THAT UP.
WE ALSO PROVIDE EDUCATION
AND TRANSLATION.
NOT ALL DISTRIBUTORS
DO THAT.
YOU KNOW,
THE -- THE -- THE ONE SECTOR,
THE ONE INDUSTRY
THAT'S MAINTAINED ITS MARGINS
FOR 100 YEARS
IS THE COSMETIC BUSINESS.
YES.
YES.
I'M JUST
CHOKING ON THIS VALUATION.
OKAY, WELL, YOU DIGEST THAT.
LET ME SPEAK, IF YOU DON'T MIND.
[ LAUGHS ]
I LOVE THE DISTRIBUTOR SPACE
BECAUSE YOU'RE A MIDDLE MAN.
IT'S CHEAPER.
YOU CAN GROW FASTER.
BUT YOUR NUMBERS ARE NUTS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE
COME IN CHEAPER
AND OFFERED
A LOT MORE STOCK, I THINK.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO CONSIDER THAT VALUATION
FOR A HIGHER EQUITY SHARE?
PERCENTAGE.
WELL, A LOT OF --
I'D HAVE TO ASK A LOT OF STOCK.
HOW MUCH?
I GUESS I'D GIVE YOU
$425,000 FOR 40%.
[ LAUGHS ]
BARBARA'S NOT CRAZY,
'CAUSE I WAS GONNA OFFER YOU
$425,000 FOR 50%.
Herjavec: I THINK YOU GUYS
ARE THE REAL DEAL.
YOU'RE SMART.
YOU HAVE CREDIBILITY.
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY.
IT'S A PURE EXECUTION BUSINESS,
SO I GOT TO BUY YOU.
I'LL MAKE A BET
ON THE TWO OF YOU,
BUT NOT AT 10%.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $425,000 FOR 30%.
I THINK THE BUSINESS IS WORTH
ROUGHLY $1 MILLION TODAY.
BUT WE'RE PROJECTED TO DO
$1 MILLION
JUST IN OUR REVENUE THIS YEAR.
NEXT YEAR, OUR PROJECTION
IS OVER $3 MILLION
AND IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS --
BUT THE KEY WORD THERE
IS "PROJECT".
GUYS, WHAT YOU NEED --
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK.
OKAY.
SURE.
I'VE BEEN IN
THE BEAUTY-RETAIL INDUSTRY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
IT'S A GREAT BUSINESS,
BUT IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE
BUSINESS, AS YOU KNOW.
OF COURSE.
ABSOLUTELY.
ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL,
RIGHT?
SO, FOR ME, IT'S NOT THE RIGHT
INVESTMENT, SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
THANK YOU.
GUYS, YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN
VERY FAR WITH DIGITAL CONTENT,
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
YOU'RE HERE.
WE HAVE A LONG WAY
TO GO ON THAT.
RIGHT, YOU HAVEN'T
DONE BUBKIS YET.
BUT THAT'S WHERE THE VIRAL
OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD COME UP.
WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP,
ACTUALLY.
WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT EXPERTISE
IN THE DIGITAL SPACE.
SARAH AND CHRISTINE HAVE
THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR KOREAN BEAUTY BUSINESS
GLOW RECIPE,
BUT MARK MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED.
YOU HAVE BARBARA, WHO OFFERED
YOU $425,000 FOR 40%.
YOU HAVE ROBERT, WHO OFFERED YOU
$425,000 FOR 30%.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT MINE?
AND, KEVIN,
WHAT DID YOU OFFER?
WELL, I ALSO WANT A PREMIUM
FOR WHO I AM, MR. WONDERFUL,
SO I'M ASKING FOR AN EXTRA 10%,
BECAUSE I AM MR. WONDERFUL.
OF COURSE.
$425,000 FOR 50%.
FOR 50%
AND, MARK, MAY I ASK
IF YOU HAVE AN OFFER, TOO?
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD LOSE
ANY ONE OF THOSE OFFERS
ANY MINUTE NOW.
I MEAN, AS YOU'RE TALKING,
THEY COULD DROP OUT.
I'M USUALLY
SO DECISIVE ON WHAT I SEE,
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW --
I MEAN I WORK WITH
A LOT OF KOREAN COMPANIES,
SO I'M THINKING,
"OKAY,
THERE'S AN ANGLE THERE."
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DON'T KNOW
ON THIS PARTICULAR CASE,
SO I'M OUT.
MY NAME IS SARAH OLIVER,
I LIVE IN
MILL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA.
GROWING UP, MY MOM
AND MY GREAT AUNT TAUGHT ME
HOW TO KNIT,
AND I WAS INSTANTLY HOOKED.
ONE YEAR FOR THE HOLIDAYS,
I DECIDED TO KNIT
EVERY WOMAN IN MY FAMILY A GIFT.
THEY LOVED IT,
AND I STARTED GETTING REQUESTS.
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I HAD
A BUSINESS ON MY HANDS.
AND AS IT GREW,
I NEEDED TO BRING ON SOME HELP.
YOU MIGHT KNOW THEM
AS SENIOR CITIZENS,
BUT I CALL THEM
"THE PURLETTES PLUS ONE"
I'M 88 YEARS OLD.
I'M 79 YEARS OLD.
I'M 94, AND I LOVE KNITTING.
Richards: YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD
TO KEEP WORKING.
IT JUST KEEPS YOU YOUNG.
Oliver: THE PURLETTES ARE
THE BACKBONE OF OUR BUSINESS.
IT'S THEIR PASSION
AND NIMBLE FINGERS
THAT MAKE THIS COMPANY
SO WONDERFUL.
YEP, THEY'RE ALL HAND-KNIT.
PEOPLE LOVE MY PRODUCT.
AND ONCE THEY HEAR
THE STORY BEHIND IT,
THEY FEEL EVEN MORE CONNECTED.
I HOPE THE SHARKS SEE THE VALUE
IN MY BUSINESS MODEL
SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE TO BRING
JOY TO THE PURLETTES PLUS ONE.
MY NAME IS SARAH OLIVER.
I'M THE FOUNDER AND OWNER
OF SARAH OLIVER HANDBAGS.
I'M ASKING FOR $250,000
SARAH OLIVER HANDBAGS
ARE ALL HAND-KNIT
WITH LOVE AND CARE
IN THE U.S.A.,
AND I'VE DEVELOPED A UNIQUE
MANUFACTURING MODEL
NEVER USED BEFORE.
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU
THE PURLETTES PLUS ONE.
MY NAME IS ELLIE LEVA --
REALLY ELEANOR.
I'M DAPHNEY CAMPBELL.
KATHERINE GAINEY.
MY NAME IS HECTOR RICHARDS.
I'M THE "ONE" OF
THE PURLETTES PLUS ONE.
TO BE INVOLVED IN A COMPANY
AT 83 1/2
IS LIKE HAVING
YOUR WISH COME TRUE.
IT'S THE JOY OF MY ELDER LIFE.
I'VE JUST LOVED IT,
AND I'M THRILLED
WITH SARAH'S SUCCESS.
I LOVE IT.
I LOVE HER, AND I LOVE
THE KNITTING. [ LAUGHS ]
AND I LOVE THE PURLETTES.
Cuban: AWW.
WHAT A SURPRISE THAT WAS.
THEY'RE MY HEROES..
THIS BUSINESS
IS A VERY BIG PART OF ME.
I JUST LOVE WORKING
WITH THESE SENIORS.
WITH YOUR INVESTMENT,
YOUR ADVICE, AND YOUR CONTACTS,
WE CAN BUILD THIS
REVOLUTIONARY BUSINESS TOGETHER.
SARAH, IS THIS A CHARITY
OR IS IT A BUSINESS
OR A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH?
THIS IS A BUSINESS.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A BUSINESS.
CAN WE SEE THE BAGS?
SURE.
OH, I FORGOT.
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, THIS IS FOR YOU
TO LOOK AT.
THANK YOU, SARAH.
THAT'S OUR GOLD WRISTLET.
OH, HERE.
OH, BLACK. OOH.
AND, YEP,
THAT'S OUR CROSSBODY.
NICE.
GREEN FOR YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.
MY FAVORITE COLOR
IS IT KNIT OR WOOL?
IT'S KNIT.
THE "O" ON THERE
IS ACTUALLY A BROOCH.
IT'S REMOVABLE.
IT MEANS IT COMES OFF,
AND YOU CAN WEAR IT AS A PIN?
EXACTLY.
SO, I FOUND A CARD IN MINE
THAT SAYS
"MY NAME IS DAPHNEY,
AND THIS IS MY STORY."
DID DAPHNEY KNIT MY BAG?
DAPHNEY KNIT YOUR BAG.
SHE'S 92.
SHE'S AMAZING.
THEY'RE ALL INCREDIBLE.
WHAT DID YOU PAY ESTHER
TO MAKE MY BAG?
I PAID HER $17.
IS THAT RIGHT?
O'Leary: AND THEY'RE
ALL DOING IT WILLINGLY.
THIS ISN'T
A GERIATRIC SWEATSHOP, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHS ] NO.
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA ASK THAT,
MR. WONDERFUL.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW.
NO, ACTUALLY I'M THE ONE
WHO GETS IN TROUBLE.
IF I DON'T BRING ENOUGH WOOL,
THEY LOOK AT ME
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WHAT?
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME
THIS WEEK.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO ALL WEEK?"
THEY'RE REALLY QUITE NICE.
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE ONE?
AND WHAT DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
SO, THE RESORT
IS OUR BEST SELLER.
IT COST $47 TO MAKE.
THEY RETAIL FOR $225.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
SO FAR?
UM, OUR LIFETIME SALES
ARE $1.9 MILLION.
OH, THAT'S COOL.
LAST YEAR WAS $360,000.
SO, SARAH,
WHAT DO YOU REALLY NEED?
YEAH.
WHAT I NEED
IS MONEY -- WORKING CAPITAL.
RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE 90 ACCOUNTS --
90 STORE ACCOUNTS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
SO, THERE'S
NO ONLINE BUSINESS HERE?
I DO SELL THEM ONLINE,
TOO.
BECAUSE I THINK
THE OPPORTUNITY
IS TO TELL THE STORIES
OF THESE WOMEN.
WHERE DID YOU FIND
THOSE WOMEN?
I'M SO CURIOUS.
SO, WHEN MY KIDS
WERE LITTLE,
THERE'S THIS AMAZING
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY --
THE REDWOODS SENIOR COMMUNITY
IN MILL VALLEY.
I USED TO BRING MY KIDS THERE.
THAT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA.
SO FAST-FORWARD TO WHEN
I WANTED TO SCALE PRODUCTION,
IT'S OBVIOUS.
WHO KNITS?
WHO DO I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH?
I DON'T WANT TO GO OVERSEAS.
AND SO IT JUST --
IT WAS A NATURAL --
LIKE, RIGHT AROUND --
SO IMPRESSIVE.
I DIDN'T THINK OF
THE MARKETING BACK THEN.
YEAH, COULD YOU IMAGINE --
IF I GO TO YOUR WEBSITE,
CAN A SEE A LOT OF --
CAN I MEET DAPHNEY?
YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN.
WE HAVE VIDEOS.
THAT'S AWESOME.
AND HOW MANY PURSES CAN
A PURLETTE MAKE IN A DAY?
WELL, A PURLETTE CAN MAKE
ABOUT THREE IN A -- IN A WEEK,
WE KIND OF AVERAGE.
SO, YOU KNOW,
I JUST HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S SO TOUCHING TO ME --
ACTUALLY
BROUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE --
BECAUSE I THINK THAT, OFTEN,
WE DON'T VALUE ENOUGH
OUR ELDERLY IN SOCIETY,
YOU'RE RIGHT.
AND YOU HAVE GIVEN THEM ALL
SOMETHING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT.
NO QUESTION.
THEY'RE FEELING
A PART OF SOMETHING.
RIGHT.
AND THEY NEED TO
CONSTANTLY FEEL
IMPORTANT AND VALUED
AND PART --
I GET THAT FEEDBACK
ALL THE TIME.
I WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
AND I WOULD LIKE --
IF MY FELLOW SHARKS WOULD LIKE
TO BE IN ON THE OFFER -- I'D
LIKE FOR US ALL TO BE IN ON IT,
BECAUSE ACTUALLY THINK
THAT I WOULD LOVE FOR ALL OF US
TO HELP MAKE THIS
A STATEMENT.
OH.
WHAT'S THE OFFER?
SO MY OFFER IS
$250,000...
MM-HMM.
...FOR 25%.
OKAY.
EACH SHARK GETS 5%.
OKAY.
I'M IN.
LET ME TELL YOU
WHY I'M IN.
OKAY, ROBERT.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT CAUSE,
MM-HMM.
BUT IT'S SOMETHING
THAT LORI SAID.
WHEN YOU HAVE A PRODUCT
THAT TOUCHES THE HEARTS
OF CONSUMERS, IT BLOWS UP.
MM-HMM.
I THINK PEOPLE AT HOME
AND ACROSS AMERICA
ARE GONNA JUST GO BOOM
TO THE WEBSITE.
RIGHT. I HOPE SO.
I REALLY DO.
AND I HOPE THAT WE GET
A MILLION MORE PURLETTES.
O'Leary: YEAH, BUT I...
I'D LIKE TO ASK A FEW MORE
QUESTIONS ABOUT NUMBERS
BEFORE I --
I DECIDE IF I'M GONNA INVEST...
ABSOLUTELY.
...BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
THE CHARITY TANK TO ME.
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I'M NOT IN IT
FOR THE CHARITY.
YOU SOMETIMES -- IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT THE MONEY.
LORI,
PICK YOUR OWN CHARITIES.
LISTEN, I'M SORRY. I DO.
I GIVE A LOT TO CHARITY.
IT IS ABOUT THE MONEY.
BUT THIS IS
AN INVESTMENT FOR ME.
HOW DO I FIND PURLETTES
THAT DO FOUR A WEEK?
SO, RIGHT NOW, I WORK WITH
TWO RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES.
I HAVE ABOUT 30 KNITTERS.
THEY CAN MAKE ABOUT
4,000 BAGS A YEAR.
THAT TRANSLATES
TO ABOUT $900,000.
MY GOAL IN THE NEXT
TWO TO THREE YEARS
IS TO GO OUT TO ABOUT
FIVE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES
WHO ALREADY WANT ME.
SARAH, WE -- LOOK.
LORI MADE A GREAT OFFER.
I'M HAPPY TO GO IN WITH HER.
WAIT A SECOND.
NO, SHE DIDN'T.
SHE MADE AN OFFER
ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US.
YEAH, NO, IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO IN ON IT.
I WANTED TO EXTEND IT
TO EVERYBODY.
OKAY.
SARAH, THIS FALLS SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN A COTTAGE INDUSTRY
AND A CHARITY IN MY MIND.
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN INVESTABLE
BUSINESS, SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU, THOUGH.
SARAH, I THINK
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GREAT,
BUT IT'S JUST NOT A FIT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Herjavec: I'M HAPPY
TO GO IN WITH LORI.
$250,000.
$125,000 FROM EACH OF US.
OKAY.
25%.
THAT'S -- THAT'S SO FANTASTIC.
IS THAT A YES?
MM-HMM.
BUT I GOT TO HAVE 10%,
SARAH.
SARAH,
I LIKE THAT DEAL BETTER.
I'M FINE WITH THAT DEAL.
YEAH.
SO THAT'S THE 30%?
YEAH,
AND YOU GET THREE SHARKS.
YEAH, AND YOU GET
$250,000 FOR 30%.
BUT I TELL YOU --
LIKE I SAID, YOU SHOULD'VE SAID
YES WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.
YEAH, I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY
LIKE TO GO WITH LORI AND ROBERT.
WELL, NOW I LIKE
KEVIN'S DEAL BETTER, SARAH.
YOU DO? OKAY.
YEAH.
Greiner: UH-OH.
UH-OH.
Cuban: BOY, THERE'S
A LESSON RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE SHARK TANK.
THAT'S THE SHARK TANK.
WHAT HAPPENED TO CHARITY?
MY GOD. GONE.
OUT THE WINDOW.
I NEVER SAID CHARITY.
WE WANT ALL THE SHARKS.
I THINK IT'S A BUSINESS.
Cuban:
CONGRATULATIONS, SARAH.
OH, MY GOD.
THE PURLETTES ARE GONNA BE
SO EXCITED.
[ LAUGHS ]
I KNOW THAT THEY'RE --
I'M EXCITED.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M EXCITED.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
CONGRATS.
YOU BETTER GO
AND SEE SOME PURLETTES.
YOU NEED A LOT MORE.
I KNOW.
MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.
RIGHT.
WE'RE GONNA GET
A LOT OF PURLETTES.
I KNOW IT.
WE ARE.
WE ARE,
AND WE'RE GONNA SELL!
WE ARE.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
WE ARE GONNA MAKE
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Corcoran: BYE-BYE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATS, SARAH.
Oliver: THANK YOU.
NOW, GET
THOSE PURLETTES TO WORK!
I WILL!
I'M SO EXCITED.
I JUST CANNOT WAIT
TO LET THE PURLETTES KNOW
THAT WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE
TEAM BEHIND US
TO GROW THIS COMPANY LIKE CRAZY.
I HOPE TO HIRE SENIORS
EVERYWHERE.
