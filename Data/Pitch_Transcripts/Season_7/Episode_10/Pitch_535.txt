I'M GASTON BLANCHET
FROM ARGENTINA,
AND THIS IS MY BEST FRIEND,
JESSE POTASH,
FROM NEW YORK.
OUR COMPANY IS TRUNKSTER,
Potash: SO, YES, THEY CAN
ABSOLUTELY TAKE A HIT.
THEY'VE BEEN TESTED
TO EVERY LUGGAGE STANDARD --
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS.
MAY I SEE HOW MUCH
THAT WEIGHS?
I JUST WANT TO PULL IT.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, THEY'LL
WEIGH LESS THAN EIGHT POUNDS
WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED.
WHEELS ARE GREAT.
SO, HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
I WAS IN A LUGGAGE STORE,
AND I REALIZED,
"LIKE, WOW, EVERY LUGGAGE BRAND
IS THE SAME."
AS A MILLENNIAL, LIKE,
I'D LIKE TO BUY A BRAND
THAT HAS A STORY BEHIND IT,
THAT COMES FROM
GRASSROOTS TRAVELERS.
THERE'S NO BRAND LIKE THIS
IN THE LUGGAGE MARKET.
IT'S SO CORPORATE.
YOU'RE SUCH MILLENNIALS.
YEAH.
YOU ARE!
WELL, NO --
YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
IT'S SO CORPORATE."
NO -- BUT, NO --
WELL, IT'S BORING.
IT'S ABOUT TO GET CORPORATE.
YEAH.
$1.4 MILLION FOR 5%?
WHICH ONE OF YOU DO I ABSOLUTELY
TEAR TO PIECES NOW
ON A $28-MILLION-DOLLAR
VALUATION?
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE THE PAIN FIRST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
GASTON,
ARE YOU NOT SELLING THIS YET?
WE ARE PRE-SELLING THIS
BECAUSE WE ARE STILL
IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.
Greiner: KICKSTARTER.
YOU'RE PRE-SELLING, AND YOU HAVE
A $28 MILLION VALUATION?
YES, SIR.
DO YOU SEE ANY PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
NO, BECAUSE --
I'LL EXPLAIN
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET ME EXPLAIN.
EIGHT MONTHS AGO, WE BECAME
THE MOST CROWDFUNDED
TRAVEL CAMPAIGN
IN HISTORY ON KICKSTARTER.
WE RAISED $1.4 MILLION.
WE HIT OUR GOAL IN ONE HOUR.
TO DATE, WE'VE PRE-SOLD
$2 MILLION OF THIS BAG,
WHICH SELLS ITSELF.
WE DIDN'T EVEN ASK
HOW MUCH ONE OF THESE COSTS.
YEAH, SO WE RETAIL THEM
FOR $395,
AND THE COST IS ABOUT
20% OF THAT.
FOR THE SMALL ONE?
EXACTLY.
SO, IT'S A PROTOTYPE,
BUT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE
BOUGHT IN, HAVEN'T TRIED IT.
THESE ARE THE FIRST SAMPLES
OFF THE LINE.
WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE
TO SHIPPING -- UH, NEXT MONTH.
WE HAVE 5,000 UNITS...
TAKES ABOUT FOUR DAYS.
Greiner: THAT ARE BEING MADE.
...THAT ARE ABOUT TO BE
ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE
THAT WILL BE SHIPPED OUT
NEXT MONTH.
SO, WE ACTUALLY --
YOU HAVE A GUY THERE
CHECKING ON THE QUAL--
THE QUANTITY?
WE ACTUALLY LIVE IN CHINA.
WE LIVE IN CHINA.
YOU DO?
YEAH, WE'VE LIVED
FOR MONTHS IN CHINA.
WE'RE BACK NOW.
WE LIVE IN THE FACTORY IN CHINA.
WHY IS IT WORTH
$28 MILLION?
WELL...EXACTLY.
THAT WAS MY FIRST QUESTION.
YOU NEVER ANSWERED.
WE ARE ESTIMATING $3 MILLION
IN SALES THIS YEAR.
SO FAR, WE'VE DONE $2 MILLION.
NEXT YEAR, WE'RE ESTIMATING
ABOUT $9 MILLION IN SALES.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS,
FIRST OF ALL,
INTO A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY.
AND WE'RE DOING -- WE'RE GONNA
DISRUPT THE LUGGAGE INDUSTRY
THE SAME WAY
THE MATTRESS INDUSTRY
HAS RECENTLY BEEN DISRUPTED.
HOW?
AND THAT'S BY OFFERING
A PREMIUM PRODUCT
AT A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT
TO CONSUMERS.
LUGGAGE OF THIS QUALITY --
SO, YOU'RE GONNA SELL
EVERYTHING ONLINE.
DIRECT TO CONSUMERS.
ALL ONLINE.
ALL RIGHT.
LORI, LUGGAGE QUEEN.
IS THIS REVOLUTIONARY?
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
VERY CLEVER.
IS IT WORTH $28 MILLION?
NOTHING'S WORTH 28 MILLION.
THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER STORY.
YOU GUYS KNOW
IT'S A HUGE ASK.
Blanchet: IT'S A HUGE ASK.
YOU REALIZE THAT.
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN IT
INTO PEOPLE'S HANDS YET.
WELL, HSN REACHED OUT TO US
AND SAID --
BUT YOU'RE PRICING THAT AS
THOUGH IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED.
ASK ME
IF IT'S WORTH $28 MILLION,
AND I'LL TELL YOU.
NO!
I GOT TO TELL YOU.
I THINK THE BUSINESS
IS PROBABLY WORTH
$5 MILLION
TO $8 MILLION TODAY.
MOST.
WOULD YOU MAKE AN OFFER --
BUT IF WE'RE MAKING $3 MILLION
IN OUR FIRST YEAR --
HANG ON. HANG ON.
LET'S GET ANOTHER TAKE.
YOU PUT THAT MONEY IN YOUR
POCKET. THAT'S MONEY YOU MADE.
YOU PUT THAT IN YOUR POCKET,
BUT THAT'S ANECDOTAL, RIGHT?
IT'S ONE-OFF.
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY TRACK RECORD THERE.
WOULD YOU SELL
30% OF THE COMPANY TO ROBERT
FOR $1.4 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS
HIS MORE CONSERVATIVE
$5 MILLION VALUATION?
WOULD YOU?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THE INTEREST WE'VE SEEN FROM
ALL THE OTHER LUGGAGE COMPANIES
WHO ARE --
WHO ARE RUNNING SCARED
AND INTERESTED IN WHAT
WE'RE DOING IS WE CAN GROW THIS
TO $10 MILLION, $20 MILLION.
GUYS, GUYS. IT'S EXCITING.
IT'S EXCITING.
WE'RE REACHING
FOR A BIG SALE.
WE HAVE NEW PRODUCTS
IN THE LINE.
WE WANT TO MAKE THIS
A CAMERA BAG, A PHOTOGRAPHY BAG.
DO YOU HAVE ANY FLEXIBILITY
ON THE 28% --
WE HAVE OTHER PRODUCTS
THAT WE'RE GONNA DEBUT
AND UPSELL ON OUR WEBSITE.
GASTON. GASTON! STOP TALKING!
SILENCE. NO MORE EXCITEMENT.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT...
Herjavec: WHAT'S GOING ON?!
WHEN IN TROUBLE, DANCE.
...ARE YOU GONNA WALK OUT OF
THE SHARK TANK
WITH A DEAL OR NOT?
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT RIGHT NOW.
NOBODY'S GONNA HIT YOUR BID
AT $28 MILLION. NOBODY.
Gaston: OF COURSE --
OF COURSE
SILENCE!
ARE YOU PREPARED
TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY
ON YOUR $28 MILLION ASK?
BUT THEY QUESTION THE HIGH
VALUATION OF GASTON AND JESSE'S
SMART LUGGAGE COMPANY,
TRUNKSTER.
ARE YOU PREPARED TO HAVE
FLEXIBILITY
ON YOUR $28 MILLION ASK?
THE REMINDS ME, IF I JUST
MAY SHARE A STORY,
THAT IN JANUARY, WE WERE
CHOOSING OUR FACTORY PARTNER,
AND WE WEREN'T QUITE ABLE
TO GET THERE ON THE PRICE.
MY UNCLE, WHO'S A BUSINESSMAN,
HE TOLD ME TO SAY THIS --
"LISTEN" --
HE'S FROM LONG ISLAND --
"LISTEN, SOMEBODY'S GONNA
MANUFACTURE TRUNKSTER.
EITHER IT'S GONNA BE YOU
OR IT ISN'T.
WHOEVER IT IS, THAT PERSON'S
GONNA MAKE A LOT OF MONEY."
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WAS TRUE
THEN, AND IT'S TRUE NOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
OUR FACTORY PARTNER
IS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.
JESSE, YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T NEED US?
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION,
AND YOU CAME BACK WITH A STORY.
NO, NO, NO. I WILL SAY TO THAT,
WE'RE REASONABLE.
WE'RE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE.
WE UNDERSTAND
THIS IS A BUSINESS,
AND WE WANT
THE RIGHT PARTNER.
Gaston: WOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING.
YOU CAME IN HERE KNOWING THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?
YOU KNEW IT.
I KNOW.
YEAH, DO A LITTLE BUM-BUM-BUM.
THANK YOU GUYS,
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
ROBERT, WE REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR OFFER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANKS, GUYS.
OH, MY GOSH.
IF YOU GET PAID BACK
YOUR MONEY
OVER AN INDEFINITE
PERIOD OF TIME,
WELL,
THAT'S NOT VERY ENTICING.
TO KNOW THAT IN TWO YEARS,
YOU'LL DEFINITELY
HAVE THAT MONEY BACK
OR THERE'S A PENALTY,
THEN THAT MAKES US WORK HARDER
AND IT MAKES THEM
MORE SECURE.
