NOW, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE ALL THINKING.
[ LAUGHS ]

TO TRY ONE OF THESE ON.
[ LAUGHS ]
I CAN'T WAIT
TO TRY IT ON, DAVID.
BUT FIRST,
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION
I MUSTACHE YOU.
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
WILL JOIN ME
AND TAKE BEARD HEAD TO CREATE
THE PERFECT STORM OF SUCCESS?
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU,
DAVID.
THIS ONE
IS GONNA BE FOR YOU.
Greiner:
THIS ONE? OH, MY.
GET THAT ONE.
HOW DO YOU...
Stankunas:
AND, BARBARA.
Corcoran: THANK YOU.
Greiner:
UH, VELCRO.
ALL THE BEARDS
ARE DETACHABLE.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK GOD.
[ LAUGHING ]
HO, HO,
HO, HO, HO!
[ LAUGHS ]
NO CASH FLOW
FOR YOU!
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: OH!
Cuban:
VERY NICE.
DAVID,
I LOVE IT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA,
BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
SURE.
HAVEN'T I SEEN THIS BEFORE?
WE DO HAVE COMPETITORS,
YEAH.
OKAY.
LOTS OF THEM.
SO, WHY ARE YOU DIFFERENT
THAN THE OTHER ONES?
WELL, FOR ONE,
I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT
WE CAME OUT JANUARY 2009.
WE DIDN'T START SEEING COPYCATS
AND IMITATORS
UNTIL ABOUT 12 OR 18 MONTHS
AFTER THAT.
BUT THEY DO EXIST.
YOU'RE THE FIRST
TO DO THIS?
YES.
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
TO PROTECT IT?
IT IS NOT UTILITY-PATENTABLE.
TELL US ABOUT YOUR NUMBERS,
DAVID.
ABSOLUTELY.
WE'VE SOLD TO DATE 250,000 BEARD
HEADS -- $5 MILLION IN SALES.
THIS YEAR?
NO, NO, NO --
TOTAL, SINCE WE BEGAN.
SO, THEY SELL
FOR 20 BUCKS APIECE, TYPICALLY?
TYPICALLY,
$25 TO $30.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD
IN THE LAST YEAR?
SALES LAST YEAR -- $936,000,
WHICH WAS AN ANOMALY FOR US.
WE HAD A DOWN YEAR.
THE PRIOR YEAR TO THAT WAS
$1.3 MILLION AND $1 MILLION.
BUT, ALSO,
MAYBE IT MEANS IT'S SLOWING.
Stankunas: IT COULD.
SANTA DOESN'T LIKE THAT.
LAST YEAR WAS A TOUGH YEAR
FOR US BECAUSE...
WE WERE IN
AN EXPENSIVE LEGAL BATTLE.
LET ME EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED.
SO, OUR COMPETITOR CLAIMED
THAT THEY HAD A DESIGN PATENT
AND ONE OF OUR STYLES
INFRINGED ON THAT DESIGN.
Herjavec: AND WHAT WAS
THE END RESULT?
EVERYONE WALKED AWAY.
BUT HOW MUCH
DID YOU SPEND IN LEGAL FEES
TO WALK AWAY
IN THE END?
$150,000.
SO, $25 TO $35
YOU SELL IT FOR.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
AVERAGE COST IS ABOUT $4.50,
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE RANGE
'CAUSE WE HAVE
SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS.
RIGHT.
THAT ONE COST $9.50 TO MAKE.
PROFIT MARGINS ARE BETWEEN 25%
AND 35% NET INCOME --
NET-INCOME MARGIN,
AFTER COMPENSATION, EVERYTHING,
SO WE HAVE VERY,
VERY STRONG MARGINS.
SO, YOU'RE MAKING $250,000,
$350,000 A YEAR?
YES.
Herjavec:
HOW DO YOU SELL IT, DAVID?
WHAT RETAILERS?
WELL, WE'RE IN ABOUT
400 TO 500 STORES,
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES
THIS SEASON.
O'Leary:
SO, IT'S SEASONAL?
IT GOES IN FOR THE FALL
RIGHT THROUGH THE SPRING?
IT'S -- WELL, I THINK
IT'S MOSTLY HOLIDAYS.
DAVID, I TOOK A FLYER
MANY SEASONS AGO
ON THE TIPSY ELVES GUYS, LEARNED
A LOT ABOUT THAT BUSINESS.
AND MADE A TON OF MONEY.
COME ON, ROBERT.
WE DID MAKE A TON OF MONEY.
WE SIGNED A LICENSING DEAL
WITH COLLEGES, BY THE WAY.
RIGHT.
THERE'S ONLY FOUR COMPANIES
YOU NEED TO GO TO
TO GET
TO ALL THE COLLEGES.
YEP.
BUT...
THE SALES
WERE ALWAYS LIKE THIS.
WELL, WE HAD $1 MILLION,
$1.3 MILLION,
WE HAD THE DOWN YEAR, AND THEN
THIS YEAR, WE'RE GOING BACK UP.
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN
100% FINANCED
THROUGH PROFITS
FROM DAY ONE.
THE FIRST FOUR YEARS
OF THIS BUSINESS --
RAN IT COMPLETELY
OUT OF MY BEDROOM APARTMENT.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT EVENTUALLY, WE OUTGREW THAT,
AND I HAD TO GET A REAL OFFICE.
AND NOW WE HAVE A WAREHOUSE,
AND WE'RE REALLY MOVING PRODUCT.
WE'RE AT A POINT NOW
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY SCALE IT.
I THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE REASONS
TO BUY INTO THIS BUSINESS.
YOU'VE GOT
ALL THE MAGIC INGREDIENTS.
YOU HAVE GREAT MARGINS,
YOU'RE MAKING $250,000 A YEAR,
AND YOU'RE SELF-FINANCED.
YEP.
GOOD FOR YOU,
AND YOU'RE A SMART GUY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
BUT HERE'S THE RUB.
I REALLY HAVE TO LOVE A PRODUCT,
AND I DON'T GET THIS.
I'M OUT.
Cuban: DAVID, LOOK,
I THINK YOU'RE GRINDING,
YOU'RE HUSTLING,
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB WITH IT.
UM, FOR THIS TO BE REALLY
WORTHWHILE AS AN INVESTMENT,
THERE'S GOT TO BE AN ANGLE
TO GET IT TO SCALE
TO BE A $10-, $20-MILLION
BUSINESS, AND I DON'T SEE THAT.
I'M OUT.
SO, DAVID, I HEAR YOU
ON THE TAILGATE THING.
OKAY.
I LOOK AT IT -- SORT OF MY MODEL
FOR "SHARK TANK" DEALS IS,
I WANT TO AT LEAST SEE A PATH
TO A POTENTIAL OF FIVE "X"
ON MY INVESTMENT,
BUT TO GET FIVE "X," TAILGATE
HAS TO TRIPLE YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
TO $7 MILLION IN SALES.
I MEAN,
THAT'S...
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU WON'T DO IT. I-I JUST --
RIGHT.
IT'S A TOUGH ROAD,
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, IT'S JUST
I'M NOT EXCITED ENOUGH.
FAIR ENOUGH.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU,
DAVID.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
THEN THERE WAS ONE SHARK WHO'S
INVOLVED IN DRUNK ELF SWEATERS.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
YOUR PERFECT PARTNER, ROBERT.
WE'VE DONE VERY WELL
WITH THEM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
ROBERT?
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE TIPSY ELVES CAME ON,
THEY WERE DOING $600,000 A YEAR,
WHICH I FOUND AMAZING.
IN UGLY
CHRISTMAS SWEATERS,
WE'LL PROBABLY DO $15 MILLION
THIS YEAR.
WOW.
YEAH, SO,
WE'VE HAD THAT TRAJECTORY.
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
YOU SPIKED.
YOU HAD THAT,
BUT YOU FLATLINED.
YOU KNOW,
SALES DON'T LIE.
I WONDER IF YOUR GROWTH IS BEING
ABSORBED BY OTHER PEOPLE.
RIGHT.
LIKE THE OTHER BEARD GUYS
OR SOMEBODY ELSE.
SO...
RIGHT.
...I WONDER IF YOU'RE NOT
RUNNING FAST ENOUGH.
WELL,
SAY WE NEED TO MOVE FASTER.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
WE GET A SHARK,
WE CAN MOVE FASTER.
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN IT
WITH TIPSY ELVES.
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT THEY CAN DO
WITH A SIMILAR TYPE OF CONCEPT.
AND WE CAN DO
THE SAME THING.
DAVID, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T SEE IT.
