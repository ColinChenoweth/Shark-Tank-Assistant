Boyink:
HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M BRAD BOYINK
FROM FERRYSBURG, MICHIGAN.
MY COMPANY IS GeekMyTree.
I'M SEEKING $225,000
FOR 25% EQUITY.
I'M MODERNIZING
CHRISTMAS-TREE LIGHTING.
EVERY YEAR, WE TRY TO UNTANGLE
THAT BUNDLE OF LIGHTS.
WE HOPE THEY WORK.
WE WRAP THEM AROUND AND AROUND
THE CHRISTMAS TREE,
AND YET, AFTER A COUPLE DAYS,
THE TREE MOSTLY GOES UNNOTICED.
YOUR TREE DESERVES BETTER,
AND THAT'S WHY I CREATED
ANIMATED GLOW BALLS.
WITH THE ANIMATED GLOW BALLS,
WE HAVE BROUGHT THE FUN
AND EXCITEMENT
OF THE OUTDOOR LIGHT SHOW
INSIDE
TO THE FAMILY CHRISTMAS TREE.
ANIMATED GLOW BALLS HAVE
ALL KINDS OF PATTERNS AVAILABLE.
WE HAVE "FILL HER UP."
WE HAVE "BACK TO SPRING."
ONE OF MY FAVORITES --
"COLOR RAIN."
"SPARKLING GREEN,"
LIKE MONEY FOR MR. WONDERFUL.
WE HAVE OVER 118 DIFFERENT
PATTERNS AVAILABLE FOR THIS.
AND IF YOU THINK THE PATTERNS
ARE COOL, WITH YOUR HELP,
THE NEXT STEP IS TO OFFER FULL
MUSICAL SEQUENCES LIKE THIS.
[ TCHAIKOVSKY'S "THE
NUTCRACKER'S" TREPAK PLAYS ]
PRETTY COOL, HUH?
UNLIKE OTHER PRODUCTS
THAT JUST BLINK THE LIGHTS
RANDOMLY TO MUSIC,
THESE ARE
PROFESSIONALLY SYNCHRONIZED.
HUH.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY
TO HELP ME LIGHT UP THE HOLIDAYS
IN A WHOLE NEW WAY?
SO,
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
IT'S $299 AND $399 RIGHT NOW.
WHOA!
ACTUALLY,
I CAN PASS THESE OUT
SO YOU CAN SEE THE QUALITY
AND HOW WE ARE DOING IT.
THANK YOU.
WHAT YOU GET FOR THAT IS,
YOU GET THE CONTROLLER.
YOU GET
16 PATTERNS BUILT IN.
YOU GET
THE MOBILE APP,
WHICH ALLOWS YOU
TO BUY ADDITIONAL PATTERNS.
THERE'S L.E.D. STRINGS
ON THE MARKET NOW
THAT ARE
MATERIALLY CHEAPER.
YES.
LIKE, A LOT CHEAPER.
LIKE, A LOT.
WHAT CLEARLY
SETS GeekMyTree APART
FROM ANY OTHER SYSTEM
OUT THERE --
IS YOU HAVE TO BE RICH
TO HAVE THEM.
POOR KEVIN --
NEVER BE ABLE TO BUY ONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M JUST STUNNED
BY THE PRICE.
WHY ARE YOU STUNNED
BY THE PRICE?
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU'D HAVE TO BE RICH.
IT'S A TON OF MONEY!
YOU PAID MORE THAN THAT
FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE LAST NIGHT!
THE CHILDREN DON'T GET ANY GIFTS
THAT YEAR.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND THAT'S ONE SET OF LIGHTS
WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE, JUST ONE?
THIS IS OUR STARTER KIT
WITH OUR EXPANSION.
HOW MUCH
IS AN EXPANSION KIT?
UH, $200.
WHOA!
BRAD, BABY!
BRAD --
I CAN BUY A TREE,
OR I CAN GET A HOUSE!
BRAD, DO YOU SEE ANY PROBLEM
WITH A FAMILY PAYING OVER $500
FOR LIGHTS
ON A TREE?
IT'S NOT
FOR EVERY FAMILY.
NO KIDDING 'CAUSE MOST OF THEM
AREN'T GONNA SEE SANTA.
THEY'RE GONNA SEE A BAILIFF
WHEN THEY GO TO DEBTOR'S PRISON.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S RIDICULOUSLY
EXPENSIVE.
[ LAUGHS ]
Boyink: MR. WONDERFUL,
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE
THAT IT IS EXPENSIVE.
I WAS ONLY ABLE TO DO A LIMITED
PRODUCTION RUN FOR THIS SEASON.
SO, WHEN --
HOW MANY DID YOU RUN,
BRAD?
WE'RE DOING 2,000 UNITS.
IF YOU ACTUALLY RUN
A LARGER VOLUME,
WHAT CAN YOU
GET THE PRICE DOWN TO?
UH, I KNOW IF WE CAN GET IT OVER
10,000 UNITS...
YEAH.
...WE CAN DROP OUR PRICE
BY 20%.
IF WE CAN GET
OVER 50,000 UNITS...
IT'S STILL
A HIGH PRICE.
O'Leary:
IT'S STILL A HIGH PRICE.
...WE CAN GET DOWN
ANOTHER 30%.
HOW MANY OF THESE
HAVE YOU SOLD?
ALMOST CLOSE
TO 300 RIGHT NOW.
300?
Corcoran: AND HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS CRAZY IDEA?
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE THAT
DO THOSE MEGA CHRISTMAS SHOWS?
YES.
YEAH,
I WAS ONE OF 'EM.
UM,
I ACTUALLY DID ONE
THAT WAS THE SECOND LARGEST
IN THE COUNTRY.
I DID 14 HOUSES
ALL SYNCHRONIZED TOGETHER.
HUH.
OVER 70,000 PEOPLE SHOWED UP
TO SEE THAT SHOW.
WOW.
WOW.
HOW EXCITING.
IT WAS CRAZY!
YOU'RE A GREAT NEIGHBOR.
WOW.
BRAD,
YOU'RE SANTA CLAUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BRAD,
YOU'RE STANDING THERE
SELLING A $500 STRING
OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
THE ONLY ONE WHO WOULD SPEND
$500 ON THIS TREE
IS SOMEBODY RICH LIKE ROBERT,
WHO LIVES IN
A 20-BEDROOM MANSION ON A CLIFF.
SO I'M VERY OUT.
Herjavec: BRAD?
YES?
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU'RE GONNA GET
TO A LARGER MARKET.
KEEP DOING IT.
HAVE FUN. I'M OUT.
Cuban: OKAY, SO, BRAD,
I THINK IT'S COOL,
BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT
GETTING TO BE A BIG BUSINESS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
BUT I'M OUT.
FOR CHRISTMAS,
PEOPLE WILL SPEND MONEY,
AND THEY LIKE TO DECORATE
AND ALL OF THAT.
IF IT WAS SOMETHING CHEAP,
UNDER $50,
THEN, I THINK, AS A NOVELTY,
PEOPLE WOULD BUY INTO IT,
BUT WHEN
IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE,
I FEEL LIKE
THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING
NOT FOR
THE INDOOR USE.
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I WALKED IN HERE
KNOWING YOU WERE GOING TO
BEAT ME UP ON THE PRICE.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS IS,
YOU CAME IN, IT WAS INTRIGUING,
AND THEN YOU HIT US
WITH THE PRICE,
AND IT CHOKED
EVERYBODY.
THERE'S NO WAY TO GIVE YOU
A QUARTER -- $225,000 FOR 25%.
THE PRICE IS KILLING ME
BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE,
BUT I STILL
WANT IT.
Greiner: SO,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'LL DO THIS DEAL WITH YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU $225,000 FOR 50%,
AS PARTNERS.
OH.
WHAT?
YOU CAN DO BETTER.
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM MORE
OR LESS, I DON'T CARE.
HO, HO, HO.
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I WOULD DO.
Corcoran:
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
I LOVE IT,
AND I'M GONNA BUY IT ANYWAY
BECAUSE MY WIFE MAKES ME
PUT UP A TREE EVERY YEAR,
AND I HAVE TO STRING THE LIGHTS,
AND IT MAKES ME FRIGGIN' CRAZY.
YOU DON'T DO IT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I MAKE
MY SON DO IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I STILL
HAVE TO SUPERVISE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO,
BRAD?
UM...
BRAD, I CARE.
I BET ON ENTREPRENEURS.
THEY COME TO ME WITH IDEAS.
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
I OWN HALF THE COMPANY.
50% -- I CARE.
CONGRATULATIONS, BRAD.
THANK YOU, BRAD.
Boyink: I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE 50%
BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE LONG RUN,
HE'S GONNA HELP ME BRING THIS
INTO EVERY AMERICAN'S HOUSEHOLD.
IT'S GONNA BE
A MR. WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A FESTIVE AND FUN WAY
TO KEEP WARM IN CHILLY WEATHER.
