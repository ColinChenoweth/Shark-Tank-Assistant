I'M WOMBI.
AND I'M JOHN.
AND WE'RE
FROM BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE
MORE OF A PIRATE RED.
JOHN AND I MET 10 YEARS AGO
IN COLLEGE,
STUDYING SHIP DESIGN,
NAVAL ARCHITECTURE,
AND MARINE ENGINEERING.
WE RECONNECTED
AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL
A FEW YEARS LATER
AND DECIDED TO PURSUE
A BUSINESS IDEA TOGETHER.
I THINK WE GOT IT.
LET'S GET IT IN THE COMPUTER.
WE USE OUR BACKGROUND
IN SHIP DESIGN
TO CREATE A UNIQUE TWIST
TO AN EXISTING PRODUCT.
WE'RE USING
THE SAME SOFTWARE,
WE'RE USING
THE SAME 3-D THINKING
THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE
CREATE MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS.
THIS BUSINESS
MEANS EVERYTHING.
NEITHER OF US TOOK A JOB
COMING OUT OF SCHOOL.
WE'RE UNDER
A LOT OF STUDENT LOANS.
WE'VE PRETTY MUCH INVESTED ALL
OF OUR MONEY INTO THIS BUSINESS.
WE COULD'VE TAKEN LUCRATIVE JOBS
AFTER GRADUATING HARVARD,
BUT WE BELIEVE SO STRONGLY
IN OUR IDEA
THAT THIS IS ALL WE WANT
TO FOCUS ON.
WE NEED A SHARK
TO HELP US GROW THE BUSINESS,
OPEN MORE RETAIL OUTLETS, AND
REALLY GET OUR BRAND OUT THERE.
WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO TOUCH
PEOPLE'S LIVES WITH OUR DESIGNS,
AND A SHARK CAN
MAKE THAT POSSIBLE IN A BIG WAY.
I'M JOHN,
AND THIS IS MY PARTNER, WOMBI,
AND WE'RE
THE CREATORS OF LOVEPOP.
AND WE'RE HERE TODAY
TO OFFER YOU 10% OF OUR COMPANY
FOR $300,000.
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE DRUGSTORE
AND YOU WERE SEARCHING
FOR A BIRTHDAY CARD?
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
THAT RACK
OF THOUGHTLESS,
UNINSPIRED CARDS,
DOING THAT MULTIPLE-CHOICE
SELECTION PROCESS,
AND YOU END UP
WITH SOMETHING THAT'S...
OKAY.
DON'T SETTLE ANYMORE.
COME TO LOVEPOP,
WHERE WE CREATE
INTRICATE PAPER ART...
THAT POPS.
JUST LIKE THIS.
IN TODAY'S DIGITAL
AND DISTRACTING WORLD,
THINGS MIGHT BECOME
MORE IMPERSONAL.
BUT A LOVEPOP IS UNIQUE
BECAUSE IT'S UNEXPECTED.
IT'S TANGIBLE.
THE REACTION WE'VE GOTTEN
HAS BEEN SO POSITIVE
AND SO EMOTIONAL
THAT WE REALIZE WE'RE TAPPING
INTO SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER --
THE HUMAN NEED
TO CONNECT.
SO, SHARKS,
HELP US SPREAD THE LOVE.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
A COUPLE SPECIAL-EDITION CARDS
FOR YOU GUYS
HERE TODAY.
GOOD. I WOULDN'T EXPECT
ANYTHING LESS.
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT.
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
LORI.
THANK YOU.
OH, WOW.
THAT IS SO COOL.
OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH!
I LOVE IT!
[ BOTH CHUCKLE ]
Corcoran:
HOW UNEXPECTED. IT IS.
Herjavec:
YOURS IS SHOPPING?
Greiner:
I LOVE IT, YEAH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
O'Leary:
SHOP TILL YOU DROP.
WHAT'S YOURS,
BARBARA?
REAL ESTATE, OF COURSE,
BUT HIS IS MONEY.
YEAH,
HIS IS COOL.
ABSOLUTELY.
Cuban:
YEAH, I LIKE HIS.
[ VOCALIZES ]
Corcoran:
OH, MY, MY, MY.
Greiner: WHAT'S YOURS,
MARK BASKETBALL?
IT'S SHOCKING.
Greiner: SHOCKING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Herjavec:
LOOK HOW INTRICATE IT IS.
O'Leary: SO, TELL US ABOUT
THE BUSINESS MODEL.
YOU HANDCRAFTING
EACH OF THESE?
HOW ELSE
WOULD I FIND YOU?
ARE YOU ONLINE SELLING THEM
OR AT STORES?
YEAH, SO, LET'S -- LET'S BREAK
IT APART INTO TWO QUESTIONS.
SO, THE ONE IS,
WHAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL?
HOW ARE WE SELLING THESE? AND
ONE IS, HOW DO WE MANUFACTURE?
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
WOMBI.
[ GREINER CHUCKLES ]
WOMBI, I LOVE HOW
YOU'RE CONTROLLING THE SHARKS.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, WE'LL START
WITH THE FIRST ONE,
WHICH IS,
HOW DO WE SELL THEM?
SO, WE HAVE FOUR KIOSKS
IN BOSTON.
SO --
IN BOSTON?
IN BOSTON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S HOMETOWN.
EXACTLY.
SO,
OUR STRATEGY IS KIOSKS,
AND THAT'S WHERE
WE MEET THE CUSTOMER.
THAT'S WHERE THEY HAVE
THE EXPERIENCE,
OPENING THE CARDS,
WHAT YOU JUST EXPERIENCED,
THEN THOSE CUSTOMERS COME ONLINE
INTO THE LOVEPOP ECOSYSTEM,
WHERE WE OFFER
ADDITIONAL SERVICES
LIKE SEND A SURPRISE,
WHERE WE'LL ACTUALLY HAND-WRITE
A NOTE IN THE CARD AND MAIL IT.
OKAY,
WHAT DOES THAT COST?
$8 TO $13 A CARD.
WHOA.
AND IF YOU CHOOSE
TO SEND A SURPRISE OPTION,
IT'S FIVE
MORE DOLLARS.
ARE YOU GUYS ARTISTS?
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
SO, WE'VE ACTUALLY
KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR 10 YEARS.
WE WENT TO UNDERGRAD
SHIP-DESIGN SCHOOL TOGETHER.
REALLY?
WOW.
I WENT TO LOUISIANA AND ACTUALLY
DESIGNED SHIPS FOR FOUR YEARS.
HE WENT OFF.
HE GOT A MASTER'S AT M.I.T.
WE ACTUALLY MET BACK UP
IN BUSINESS SCHOOL.
WE GRADUATED FROM HARVARD
BUSINESS SCHOOL THREE WEEKS AGO.
HARVARD?
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU GUYS
ARE HARVARD GRADS?
SO, HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
Rose:
SO, WE WERE TRAVELING IN ASIA,
AND WE CAME ACROSS THIS ART FORM
OF SLICEFORM KIRIGAMI.
YEAH.
Rose:
AND WE FELL IN LOVE.
WE WERE JUST LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."
SO, WE CAME BACK.
WE STARTED DESIGNING CARDS.
WE STARTED SELLING CARDS
TO PEOPLE.
Herjavec: JOHN, YOU JUST
GRADUATED THREE WEEKS AGO.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
RUNNING THE BUSINESS?
SO, IT'S BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF
ENTIRELY WHILE IN SCHOOL.
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
IN THAT YEAR AND A HALF?
$300,000.
BUT IF IT'S AN ARTISAN BUSINESS
AND YOU GUYS ARE HARVARD GRADS,
DID YOU EVER TEST
PRICE SENSITIVITY?
BECAUSE WHY WOULDN'T THIS --
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.
YEAH,
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE $129?
WHY ISN'T --
IT'S A PIECE OF ART.
WHY ISN'T IT...
Herjavec: WOW.
...$99?
Greiner:
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
WE WANT THIS TO BE
AN ACCESSIBLE ART FORM.
BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY,
RIGHT?
SURE, BUT WE DO MAKE MONEY
RIGHT NOW.
WE LASER-CUT
THESE CARDS.
WE DESIGN THEM
IN A COMPUTER --
LITERALLY THE SAME SOFTWARE
THAT I USE TO DESIGN SHIPS --
AND THEN INTRODUCE THEM --
LET'S SAY I SENT YOU
3,000 ORDERS A MONTH.
HOW WOULD YOU
PRODUCE THEM?
WE ACTUALLY OPENED OUR OWN
PRODUCTION FACILITY OVERSEAS.
WE PRODUCE 20,000 CARDS A MONTH
RIGHT NOW,
AND WE'RE
SCALING THAT UP.
AND HOW MANY
DIFFERENT DESIGNS?
WE HAVE ABOUT 100
DIFFERENT DESIGNS RIGHT NOW.
WOW.
Herjavec:
LET'S TAKE A SINGLE KIOSK
AND EXTRAPOLATE
OVER A 12-MONTH WORKING PERIOD.
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE REVENUE WILL BE?
SO, IT'LL BE
ABOUT $240,000.
PER KIOSK?
PER KIOSK.
AND WHAT WOULD BE THE PROFIT
ON THAT?
IT'S GONNA BE
ABOUT $40,000.
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF A KIOSK PERSON
GOES TO THE WEBSITE
AND BUYS MORE PRODUCT?
SO, WE TESTED THIS
FOR A MONTH AND A HALF,
AND WE HAD 34 PEOPLE COME ONLINE
AND BUY.
THAT'S NOT A LOT,
ACTUALLY.
Cuban:
YEAH, IT'S NOT.
Greiner: NO.
YEAH, WE BELIEVE IN THE KIOSK
MODEL AS A MARKETING VEHICLE.
WHY? WHY?
WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S PROFITABLE.
SO, WE ARE
ATTRACTING CUSTOMERS PROFITABLY,
AND OUR FOCUS
IS ON BUILDING THE BRAND
AND THEN TAKING
THAT COMMUNITY ONLINE,
AND THAT IS THE --
WELL, ACTUALLY, YOUR FOCUS
IS ON BUILDING A CUSTOMER BASE.
THAT, IN TURN, CREATES A BRAND
FOR YOU THROUGH THEIR AWARENESS.
AND --
SO, WHAT IS THE CAPITAL COST
FOR EACH KIOSK?
IT TAKES AROUND $20,000 FLAT
TO OPEN A KIOSK.
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T LIKE
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS,
QUITE HONESTLY?
YEAH.
AT FIRST, WHEN YOU STARTED
TALKING, I GOT ALL EXCITED.
I THOUGHT, "OH, MAYBE THIS IS
MY NEXT COUSINS MAINE LOBSTER."
TWO GUYS RUNNING A SHOP
ARE PRETTY HAPPY MAKING
$200,000 A MONTH ON ONE TRUCK.
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU
AND THEM IS, THEY'RE NOT FANCY,
AND I KIND OF LIKE THAT.
THEY WANTED TO GET EVERYTHING
PERFECTLY IN ORDER
BEFORE THEY EVEN BOUGHT
THEIR SECOND COMPANY TRUCK.
THE CARDS -- THEY'RE NICE,
BUT I'VE SEEN POP-UP CARDS
IN EVERY FANCY STORE
I'VE GONE TO.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE?
YOUR LITTLE KIOSK IDEA --
IT'S A SMART IDEA,
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S TOO MUCH, TOO FAST,
TOO FANCY
THAT I MISTRUST IT.
AND I'VE INVESTED
IN BUSINESSES LIKE THAT,
AND I ALWAYS LOSE MY SHIRT,
SO, SADLY, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I THINK THAT THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL CARDS,
AND I THINK
THAT PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT.
BUT I CAN'T SEE YOUR VALUATION
RIGHT NOW, $300,000 FOR 10%.
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU,
LORI.
I HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESSES
THAT ARE IN THIS SPACE ONLINE
THAT ARE INVOLVED
AROUND MARRIAGE AND ENGAGEMENT
AND TIMES THAT PEOPLE
EMOTIONALLY ARE WILLING
TO SPEND A LOT
ON ARTISAN ITEMS LIKE THIS.
LET ME
SHOW YOU SOMETHING,
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'LL FIND IT INTERESTING.
WOMBI AND JOHN
HAVE TWO EQUAL OFFERS
FROM ROBERT AND KEVIN FOR THEIR
GREETING-CARD COMPANY, LOVEPOP.
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS NOW
ALL OF A SUDDEN --
ROBERT'S,
WHICH IS $300,000 AT 20%,
AND YOU HAVE KEVIN'S,
WHICH IS EQUAL.
I THINK I CAN BRING
A LOT OF CUSTOMERS TO YOU.
YEAH, I THINK YOU GOT TO
BUILD IT TO RETAIL PRESENCE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
FIRST, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THOSE OFFERS.
UH, WE DO BELIEVE THAT OUR
VALUATION IS FAIR AT $3 MILLION.
YOU'VE OFFERED US
A $1.5-MILLION VALUATION.
UM...
ALL RIGHT, WOMBI,
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE MIDDLE --
$300,000 FOR 15%.
John: TODAY,
I'M IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS,
AND I'M HOSTING
AN ENTREPRENEURS WORKSHOP
FOR FOUR
OF MY "SHARK TANK" COMPANIES.
JOINING ME ARE SUN-STACHES,
MYSELF BELTS, COZY BUGS,
AND BOMBAS SOCKS.
THE FOCUS OF THIS WORKSHOP
IS BUILDING ONLINE SALES
AND SOCIAL-MEDIA PRESENCE,
AND I HAVE A LOT
OF AMAZING THINGS PLANNED.
HEY, DYLAN,
GOOD SEEING YOU, MAN.
I BROUGHT IN A GUEST SPEAKER
TODAY, DYLAN WHITMAN.
HE IS AN EXPERT
IN ONLINE STRATEGIES.
SO, I'M HERE
TO TALK WITH YOU GUYS
ABOUT ACQUISITION OF CUSTOMERS
AND RETENTION OF CUSTOMERS.
Lessor: ONLINE MARKETING
CAN MAKE OR BREAK A COMPANY.
IF WE CAN TAKE COZY BUG
TO THE NEXT LEVEL
BY WHAT WE LEARNED TODAY,
I'M REAL EXCITED TO DO THAT.
Heath: WE ARE ALWAYS ADMITTING
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW,
AND WE CAN ALWAYS LEARN
FROM OTHER PEOPLE.
MAKE IT MORE ABOUT HAVING
A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR FRIENDS
THAN IT IS
ABOUT WALKING DOWN THE STREET
AND TELLING PEOPLE
WHO YOU ARE.
Man: WE REALLY HAVE VERY LITTLE
SOCIAL-MEDIA EXPERIENCE.
THIS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE
FOR US.
THANK YOU,
MAN.
THANKS A LOT.
John: NOW I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR SOME FUN.
COME ON WITH ME.
HERE'S MY SURPRISE.
I'VE BROUGHT
MY GOOD FRIEND
CELEBRITY CHEF ROCCO DiSPIRITO
HERE.
ALL RIGHT?
I'VE INVITED ROCCO DiSPIRITO
TO ACTUALLY COOK FOR US.
HE'S DONE
A TON OF SALES ONLINE
AND HAS
A HUGE SOCIAL-MEDIA PRESENCE,
AND I KNOW HE'S GOT
A TON OF GREAT ADVICE TO SHARE.
FIRST THING I LEARNED IS THAT
YOU ARE FOLLOWING YOUR FANS,
NOT THEM
FOLLOWING YOU.
YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE THEM
CONSTANTLY.
Goldfarb:
IT'S SUCH A FUN END TO THE DAY
TO EAT AND LEARN AND TALK
WITH ROCCO.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT SURPRISES
ARE IN STORE WITH DAYMOND.
HOPE YOU GUYS
ARE HUNGRY.
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH.
John: I HAVE BIG PLANS
FOR THESE COMPANIES,
AND I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
CONTINUE TO PERFORM.
COMBINED SALES
FROM ALL FOUR OF THESE COMPANIES
ARE $11 MILLION
SINCE "SHARK TANK."
GIVE IT UP
FOR ROCCO.
[ ALL CHEER ]
IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING TIME
WATCHING MY COMPANIES LEARN
AND WORK TOGETHER TODAY,
AND ONCE THEY START TO INTEGRATE
SOME OF THESE ONLINE
AND SOCIAL-MEDIA STRATEGIES,
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE
THEIR BUSINESSES
TO ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL.
THANKS, "D"!
THANKS, "D"!
THANKS, "D"!
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A SAFER ALTERNATIVE
TO CHEMICAL DEODORANTS.
