HI, SHARKS.
I'M JESS.
AND I'M SARAH.
WE'RE ASKING
FOR $50,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF OUR COMPANY, PiperWai.
THE TOXIC INGREDIENTS
IN CONVENTIONAL DEODORANT
AND ANTIPERSPIRANT
HAVE POTENTIAL LINKS
TO CANCER AND ALZHEIMER'S.
THE PROBLEM IS, WE'VE NEVER
FOUND A NATURAL DEODORANT
THAT ACTUALLY KEEPS BODY ODOR
AT BAY ALL DAY.
THAT'S WHY
WE CREATED PiperWai,
A NEW APPROACH TO DEODORANT
THAT REALLY, TRULY WORKS.
OUR PROPRIETARY BLEND
OF UNIQUE INGREDIENTS
LIKE SUPER-ABSORBENT,
ACTIVATED CHARCOAL
COMPLETELY NEUTRALIZE ODOR
INSTEAD OF JUST COVERING IT UP.
THIS IS OUR FRIEND, HEALTH
AND FITNESS GURU NOELLE ELLIE.
WHEN NOELLE
WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
SHE APPLIED PiperWai,
WENT ON A FIVE-MILE RUN,
AND HAS BEEN WORKING OUT
ON THAT MAT EVER SINCE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
SHARKS, IN A MOMENT,
WHEN NOELLE HANDS OUT SAMPLES,
WE INVITE YOU TO SMELL
FOR YOURSELF JUST HOW WELL...
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, NO!
...PiperWai KEEPS NOELLE
FEELING FRESH AND DRY ALL DAY.
O'Leary:
TO SNIFF THE NOELLE?
OH, NO.
Herjavec: USUALLY, WE'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO SNIFF THE MODELS.
O'Leary:
IT'S A SCRATCH-AND-SNIFF.
TO DEMONSTRATE
THAT NATURAL DEODORANT...
DOESN'T HAVE TO STINK.
DOESN'T HAVE TO STINK.
I GAVE SOME TO MY BEST FRIEND,
SARAH, OF COURSE,
TO TRY WHEN SHE WENT
ON A SERVICE TRIP TO GUYANA.
IT OBVIOUSLY TOOK SOME
CONVINCING BECAUSE IT'S NATURAL.
IS IT GONNA WORK IN TROPICAL --
A TROPICAL CLIMATE,
AND SHE CALLED ME FROM
AN INTERNET CAFé OVER
FaceTime AND SHE'S LIKE,
"IT'S A MILLION DEGREES HERE,
AND THIS DEODORANT IS WORKING.
YOU HAVE TO SELL THIS."
AND I TOLD HER
I WOULD ONLY SELL IT
IF SHE BECAME
MY BUSINESS PARTNER.
SO, WE DID
SOME MARKET RESEARCH.
WE GAVE SAMPLES
TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
WE CONDUCTED SURVEYS
BEFORE EVEN INCORPORATING,
AND THEN WE TURNED IT
INTO A BRAND TOGETHER.
THE CHARCOAL CREAM
THAT YOU PUT ON HERE --
CHARCOAL CREAM -- IS THAT A
TURN-OFF TO ANY OF YOUR BUYERS?
NO.
A LOT OF MAJOR BRANDS ARE GOING
TOWARDS THE CHARCOAL MOVEMENT.
IT'S BECOMING A BIT OF A TREND
IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY --
CHARCOAL MASKS,
SOAPS, CREAMS.
IT'S THE "IT" INGREDIENT
RIGHT NOW -- ACTIVATED CHARCOAL.
NEXT QUESTION -- WHAT WOULD YOU
SPEND THE MONEY ON
IF YOU WERE LUCKY
ENOUGH TO GET THE MONEY
HERE IN THE SHARK TANK?
SCALING PRODUCTION AND
INTRODUCING THE STICK APPLICATOR
IN TIME
FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
HAVE YOU DONE
ANY SKIN-SENSITIVITY TESTING?
WE DO PLAN ON DOING
A SENSITIVITY TEST.
THAT IS COSTLY, AND WITH
THE MONEY FROM THE SHARKS,
THAT IS SOMETHING
WE WILL DO IMMEDIATELY.
WHEN IT GOES ON,
DOES IT GOES ON CLEAR?
YES.
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYBODY ELSE
START USING ACTIVATED CHARCOAL
IN THEIR
NATURAL DEODORANTS?
NO, WE ARE THE FIRST
CREAM DEODORANT
TO USE ACTIVATED CHARCOAL.
I THINK
THERE IS A POWDER ON THE MARKET,
BUT IT'S VERY MESSY, AND IT
DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK THAT WELL.
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK
WOULD STOP THEM FROM DOING IT?
I MEAN,
OUR COMPETITORS CAN PICK IT UP,
BUT THEY CAN'T TAKE AWAY
THE RESPONSE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN
FROM THE COMMUNITY
WE'VE BUILT AROUND OUR PRODUCT.
YEAH, BUT --
THEY CAN'T TAKE AWAY
THE RESPONSE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.
LET ME CLEAR
THE FIELD.
MY PROBLEM IS,
YOU COME IN HERE AND SAY,
"WE'RE DIFFERENT
THAN ALL THE BIG GUYS
THAT ARE IN
THE NATURAL SOLUTION.
WE'RE UNIQUE.
WE'RE SPECIAL."
WE ARE.
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH IT BECAUSE --
THE CHEAPEST WORDS
EVER SPOKEN.
Y-YOU HAVE NO MARKET SHARE
IN THIS SPACE.
I MEAN,
LET'S BE REALISTIC.
NOW, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,
YOU'VE NOT ASKED FOR
A RIDICULOUS
$50-MILLION VALUATION,
WHICH SOME IDIOTS OFTEN
COME IN HERE AND TRY AND DO,
BUT HOW ARE YOU GONNA TURN THIS
INTO A BUSINESS
THAT'S GONNA MAKE MONEY
TO EVEN RETURN MY 50K?
RIGHT NOW,
WE SELL THROUGH OUR WEBSITE.
WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING
WITH BIG-BOX RETAILERS,
MAJOR eCOMMERCE SITES.
WE WANT
TO CLOSE THOSE DEALS.
99% OF DEODORANTS
ARE PURCHASED IN RETAIL,
NOT ONLINE,
NUMBER ONE.
NUMBER TWO,
YOU HAVE NOTHING PROPRIETARY.
THE GUYS WHO OWN THIS SPACE
ARE REALLY LARGE.
AS A SHARK, I TRY AND STAY
OUT OF THE WAY OF BEHEMOTHS
THAT CAN CRUSH ME IF I START
TO EVEN GET ON THEIR NERVES.
SO, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
YOU'VE DONE IS HORRIBLE.
IT'S JUST I DON'T SEE
HOW YOU CAN PROTECT THIS
AND BECOME
VERY BIG AT IT.
I CAN JUST SEE YOU
ON THE SIDEWALK.
GONE.
I'M OUT.
CAN I -- CAN I SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU GUYS, SHARKS?
PLEASE DO.
SO, MY MOM
IS A STAGE IV
METASTATIC
BREAST-CANCER SURVIVOR.
AS YOU MAY
OR MAY NOT KNOW,
THE CANCER MARKET IS HUGE,
RIGHT?
WHEN THEY CONTACTED ME,
I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL
BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED ALL --
EVERY ORGANIC,
EVERY ALL-NATURAL DEODORANT.
I'M A VERY ACTIVE PERSON,
AND I TRIED IT, AGAIN,
WITH MY MOM
IN MIND
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON
HER BODY IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME.
I SPEAK WITH CONVICTION
ABOUT THAT.
I TRIED IT. IT WORKS.
IT WORKS,
BUT HAVING SOMETHING WORK
AND CREATING A BUSINESS
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
NOT EVERY DEAL
IS FOR EVERY SHARK.
THIS ONE'S NOT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
Edelstein:
HI, BARBARA.
JESS,
I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU.
THANK YOU.
I-I SEE A WOMAN THERE, STANDING
THERE -- TOTALLY CREDIBLE.
I BELIEVE YOU, TOO,
AND I THINK YOU'RE NATURAL-BORN
PARTNERS -- GREAT START.
SO FAR
AS CLINICAL TESTS GO,
YOU KNOW WHAT THE POOR MAN'S
VERSION OF A CLINICAL TEST IS?
A CUSTOMER ENDORSEMENT.
THE BEST THING
IS TO COME OUT OF THE GATE,
SEE HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO IT,
IMPROVE YOUR PRODUCT,
GET FEEDBACK,
MAKE CHANGES.
THAT'S WHAT EVERY BUSINESS DOES
WHEN IT'S BIRTHING ITSELF.
NEXT, I LOVE THE WAY
YOU STOOD YOUR GROUND.
YOU HAVEN'T WAVERED ONE BIT
IN BELIEVING IN YOUR PRODUCT,
SO I BELIEVE YOU.
CAN I HAVE
ANOTHER SHOT AT THEM?
NO,
YOU CAN'T.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AND LAST,
I'M OFFERING YOU $50,000,
BUT I WANT TO BE
A THIRD PARTNER -- 33%.
Herjavec: OH. WOW.
Corcoran:
AND THE REASON I'M BEING GREEDY
IS BECAUSE
I'LL WORK WITH YOU ON IT.
Greiner:
SO, ANYWAY...
I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE
A BIT OF A HEALTH NUT.
Greiner: I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A DEODORANT
THAT WOULD WORK
THAT DOESN'T HAVE...
PASS LORI MY DEODORANT.
SHE CAN HAVE MINE. GO AHEAD.
...ALUMINUM OR ANYTHING ELSE
IN IT FOR A LONG TIME.
I HAVE TRIED
EVERY SINGLE BRAND OUT THERE.
NONE OF THEM WORK,
JUST LIKE WHAT YOU SAID.
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
THE $50,000.
O'Leary: OOH!
WHY?
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, LORI?
Herjavec: ARE YOU JUST, LIKE,
DIGGING AT BARBARA?
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
JESS AND SARAH
HAVE TWO OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FROM BARBARA AND LORI,
BUT BOTH WANT A MUCH BIGGER
STAKE THAN THE 10%
THEY WERE OFFERING
IN THEIR NATURAL
DEODORANT COMPANY, PiperWai.
O'Leary: OOH!
Corcoran: WHY?
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, LORI?
ARE YOU JUST, LIKE,
DIGGING AT BARBARA?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
Greiner: YOU NEED A LOT OF HELP.
THERE'S A LOT TO GO THROUGH.
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAND
THE CONTROL OF YOUR BUSINESS
OVER TO ANYONE.
I'M REALLY GREAT
TO WORK WITH.
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE EVEN
AS TALENTED AS LORI.
I WORK
IN A DEMOCRACY.
YOU WANT
TO HAVE EQUAL SAY...
ALL MY ENTREPRENEURS --
...IN THE BUSINESS
THAT YOU BIRTH.
I DON'T -- I DON'T FEEL THAT
I NEED TO SELL MYSELF.
I KNOW WHAT I DO
IN ALL THE BRANDS I'VE BUILT.
SHE JUST WANTS
TO TAKE CONTROL.
I'M VERY DEMOCRATIC.
I TALK WITH MY ENTREPRENEURS
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I DON'T
PULL A PLUG ON THEM
OR MAKE A DECISION THAT
WE'RE NOT ALL ON BOARD WITH.
JESS IS A REALTOR
PART-TIME.
SHE'S WILLING TO GIVE THAT UP
FOR THE COMPANY.
WE'RE VERY SMART.
LIKE, WE KNOW HOW --
WE CAN DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE
MINOR ISSUES IN THE BUSINESS.
WE DON'T NEED
COMPLETE OVERSIGHT. WE --
Corcoran:
I DON'T MISTRUST YOU AT ALL.
YEAH.
I THINK --
NOT AT ALL.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO GO DOWN TO 25%?
YES,
I WILL.
WHAT?!
DEAL.
DEAL.
