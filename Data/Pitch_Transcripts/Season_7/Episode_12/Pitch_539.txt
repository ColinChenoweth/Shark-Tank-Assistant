HI, SHARKS.
I AM ASHLEY DRUMMONDS.
AND I AM JOSH McCLELLAND,
AND WE ARE FROM TAMPA, FLORIDA.
OUR COMPANY IS ABS,
AND WE ARE SEEKING $120,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 40% OF OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, IT IS TIME TO
GET SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR
HEALTH AND FITNESS,
AND WE ALL KNOW
THE FIRST STEP IS EATING RIGHT.
SO YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE
TO SUGAR, FLAVOR, FAT,
AND HAPPINESS, OF COURSE.
INSTEAD, THOUGH,
YOU CAN WHIP UP A PILE
OF NICE, BLAND VEGETABLES,
TWO CRISP PIECES OF CARDBOARD,
AND THEN TOP IT ALL OFF WITH
A DELICIOUS PROTEIN SHAKE.
MMM!
MMM!
CHALKY.
CHALKY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT FOR
BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING...
...ABS PROTEIN PANCAKES.
THAT'S RIGHT -- GET YOUR ABS
WHILE EATING PROTEIN PANCAKES.
OH-HO.
DON'T EVEN DO THAT TO US.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AH, NOTHING.
ONE SERVING --
THIS IS FOUR FLUFFY PANCAKES,
WHICH IS UNDER 250 CALORIES,
OVER 24 GRAMS OF PROTEIN, 100%
ALL-NATURAL AND GLUTEN-FREE.
WE ALL KNOW THAT ABS START
IN THE KITCHEN, NOT IN THE GYM,
AND NOW
YOU CAN ENJOY PANCAKES
AS PART OF A HEALTHY
NUTRITION PROGRAM.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY
TO HELP US GIVE AMERICA BACK
ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE
BREAKFAST FOODS?
Both:
ABS-OLUTELY GUILT-FREE.
WHO'S HUNGRY?
WHO'S HUNGRY?
YOU GUYS WANT
TO TRY SOME PANCAKES?
WE ALL ARE.
WE'RE ALWAYS HUNGRY.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT VANILLA CAKE BATTER.
THESE ONES?
YOU HAVE CHOCOLATE CHIP,
DAYMOND.
AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO
GRAB THE BAG AND LOOK AT
THE MACROS, AS WELL.
I KNOW I'M THE CHOCOLATE ONE,
RIGHT?
WHAT ARE THE SAUCES,
ASHLEY?
Drummonds: SO, ONE OF THEM IS AN
ALL-NATURAL SUGAR-FREE SYRUP...
THANK YOU.
...AND THE OTHER ONE IS
AN ALL-NATURAL ALMOND BUTTER,
WHICH IS A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE
TO TOP THE PANCAKES WITH.
Cuban:
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT BAD.
I MEAN, WHEN YOU FIRST TASTE IT,
IT TASTES LIKE ANGEL FOOD CAKE.
IS MINE GLUTEN-FREE, TOO?
YES.
THEY'RE ALL GLUTEN-FREE.
ALL THREE.
Cuban: OH, WOW.
BECAUSE MOST GLUTEN-FREE
PRODUCTS TASTE LIKE CRAP.
EXACTLY. YEAH.
SO, LET'S SEE.
THEY HAVE AN AFTERTASTE.
A LITTLE BIT.
YEAH.
WHAT'S THAT AFTERTASTE?
A LITTLE BIT OF AFTERTASTE.
IT'S PROBABLY THE STEVIA.
PROBABLY THE STEVIA.
WE USE
A NATURAL SWEETENER
INSTEAD OF SPLENDA
OR ANY ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS.
[ CLEARS THROAT ]
IT'S A LITTLE DRY, THOUGH.
WHY IS IT SO DRY?
IT'S JUST BECAUSE
IT'S A PROTEIN-POWDER BLEND
THAT WE'VE CREATED
THAT ALSO HAS A COCONUT FLOUR
TO KEEP IT GLUTEN-FREE,
INSTEAD OF USING, LIKE,
A WHOLE-WHEAT FLOUR.
O'Leary: WHY DO WE HAVE TO BE
GLUTEN-FREE?
THAT'S A SUBSEGMENT OF A LARGER
MARKET THAT, IF THIS --
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.
IF IT TASTES GOOD,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WELL, BUT I DON'T THINK --
RIGHT.
I THINK IT COULD TASTE BETTER
IF THERE WAS A GLUTEN VERSION
WITH MORE WHEAT IN IT.
WHICH WE'RE VERY MUCH, OP--
YOU KNOW, OPEN TO.
RIGHT.
NO, ACTUALLY, KEVIN,
YOU KNOW WHAT? THE MORE I EAT...
YOU GET USED TO IT?
...THE BETTER.
HOW MANY CALORIES?
THAT ONE RIGHT THERE
IS 250 WITH --
FOR ALL THREE?
YES.
ONE SERVING.
THAT IS ONE SERVING, YES.
I JUST WANT
TO ASK ONE QUESTION.
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH
THIS IDEA?
OKAY, WELL, ACTUALLY,
THE ABS IS AN ACRONYM.
IT STANDS FOR
"AUTHENTIC BEAUTY AND STRENGTH."
SO, WE BOTH WERE IN
THE FITNESS INDUSTRY,
DOING THE TYPICAL DIETS THAT
YOU HAVE TO DO FOR PHOTO SHOOTS.
AND, BEING A FEMALE, I REALLY
STRUGGLED WITH MY SELF-ESTEEM.
AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE FITN-- YOU WERE MODELS,
OR YOU WERE NUTRITIONISTS,
TRAINERS, WHAT WAS YOUR --
WE WERE TRAINERS.
TRAINERS.
WE ALSO WERE DOING
JUST, LIKE, AMATEUR PHOTO SHOOTS
AND STUFF
TO BUILD OUR PORTFOLIO.
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD OF THESE,
AND WHAT YEAR DID YOU START?
IT HAS BEEN SELLING
FOR 11 MONTHS,
AND WE JUST WENT RIGHT OVER
$100,000 IN SALES.
AND THAT'S ALL --
THAT'S NOT BAD.
WOW.
YEAH.
McClelland:
1,600 UNITS SOLD TOTAL.
HOW DO -- HOW DO YOU SELL THEM?
1,600 UNITS? THANK YOU.
IT'S ALL DIRECTLY THROUGH
THE WEBSITE, FOR THE MOST PART.
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF REPEAT
BUSINESS PROVING THAT PEOPLE
ARE WILLING TO EAT IT
A SECOND TIME?
YES.
YES.
I'M TELLING YOU GUYS,
THE LONGER I EAT IT,
YOU GET USED TO IT,
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD.
NO, NO, IT'S GOOD, MARK.
I AGREE WITH YOU.
WHAT ARE YOUR NUMBERS
LIKE? WHAT DOES IT COST
YOU TO MAKE A PACKAGE?
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
WHAT ARE THE MARGINS?
OKAY, SO, IT COSTS ANYWHERE
FROM $12 TO $14
DEPENDING ON THE FLAVOR
TO MAKE THE PACKAGE,
AND IT SELLS --
TO <i>MAKE</i> IT?
TO <i>MAKE</i> IT?
YES.
WOW.
YES.
CLUTCH MY PEARLS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THAT'S CRAZY.
NOW, IS THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE MAKING IT IN YOUR HOME,
AND YOU'RE NOT USING --
HOW MUCH
ARE YOU SELLING IT FOR?
$42.95 RETAIL.
IT SELLS FOR $42.95 --
$42 FOR PANCAKES?!
[ ALL EXCLAIMING ]
WHOA!
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!
STOP THE MADNESS!
COME ON!
THAT'S WHERE
HER SALES COME FROM.
SHE'S SOLD THREE!
$42 FOR PANCAKES?
Herjavec: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S CRAZY.
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING
IN TERMS OF BISQUICK.
NO, I'M JUST THINKING.
RIGHT.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT OUR MARKET
IS A FITNESS MARKET
WHO SPENDS $40 TO $50
ON A POUND OF PROTEIN POWDER.
I CAN EAT THESE PANCAKES
OR BUY A CAR.
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S MY CHOICE.
Cuban: YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
REALLY THE QUESTION.
YOU WON'T HAVE ABS, THOUGH.
Greiner:
WHY DOES IT COST SO MUCH?
IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING TO
ORDER IN SUCH LOW QUANTITIES.
BECAUSE YOUR BASE
IN THIS WHOLE THING
IS A CUSTOM PROTEIN BLEND
THAT'S ALSO ALL-NATURAL.
IT'S NOT FLOURS.
SO, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
DOING THIS IN YOUR KITCHEN
AND YOU'RE ORDERING
LITTLE AMOUNTS.
WELL, WE DO HAVE
A CO-PACKER THAT DOES IT.
Y-YOU'RE NOT MAKING THIS
IN YOUR KITCHEN.
OH, YOU DO HAVE A CO-PACKER.
THIS IS THE COST
OF A CO-PACKER, YES.
IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ORDERING --
EVERYTHING.
HOW LOW COULD YOU GET IT
IF YOU WERE SELLING MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH?
$7 TO $8 A PACKAGE.
SO, IT'S STILL
EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS...
RIGHT.
...AND THAT'S
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO.
RIGHT.
BUT BODY BUILDERS
AND PEOPLE WHO COMPETE,
THEY'RE NOT --
THEY'RE NOT PRICE CONSCIOUS,
IS BASICALLY
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO.
CORRECT.
LOOK, GUYS, WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS AMAZING SO FAR.
YOU DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT,
AND YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.
THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE NOT A COMPANY YET.
YOU'RE A PRODUCT
THAT YOU HUSTLE.
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
AH.
YOU KNOW, BIG CHALLENGE --
HOW DO YOU VALUE
THIS COMPANY?
YEAH,
BIG CHALLENGE WOULD BE --
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T
THINK YOU CAME IN HERE RE--
NECESSARILY ASKING
FOR AN UNREASONABLE VALUATION.
WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW,
I CAN SEE IT.
I JUST GOT SHOCKED
WHEN I HEARD $42.
MM-HMM.
I JUST FIND IT CHALLENGING
TO -- TO GO TO --
AT $42 FOR THE PANCAKES,
IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE.
UH, AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN LAST AT THAT LEVEL,
SO, UH, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.
THANK YOU.
EVERYBODY DOES CARE ABOUT
BEING HEALTHY AND LOOKING BETTER
AND ALL OF THAT,
BUT I PERSONALLY DIDN'T LIKE
THE FLAVOR OF IT.
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO REALLY
LOVE WHAT I GET BEHIND,
SO I'M OUT.
ROBERT?
UM...
I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW,
MARK AND I DID NUTS 'N MORE,
AND WE'VE DONE VERY WELL
WITH THAT.
AND SINCE THEN, I'VE DONE
A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS
IN THE FITNESS CATEGORY,
SO WE'VE NAVIGATED
OUR WAY THROUGH THAT.
UM...I THINK
YOUR PRICE IS TOO HIGH.
BUT I LOVE
THE PACKAGING, ESPECIALLY.
I MEAN, IT'S GREAT.
AND I COULD SEE
A PRODUCT EXTENSION...
Drummonds: THANK YOU.
...CUPCAKE MIX
AND OTHER THINGS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
MAYBE IT'S THE PACKAGE,
BUT I'M IN A REALLY
SHARKY MOOD TODAY.
I'LL DO $120,000 FOR 50%.
Cuban: OHH.
YOU OFFERED 40%,
I WENT UP TO 50%.
WHY, ROBERT?
IT'S HIS MONEY.
HE CAN DO -- DO WHAT HE WANTS.
HARDWORKING GIRL.
WHY WOULD YOU GO TO 50%?
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
ASHLEY AND JOSH ARE SEEKING
$120,000 FOR 40% EQUITY
IN THEIR BUSINESS,
ABS PROTEIN PANCAKES.
I'LL DO $120,000 FOR 50%.
Cuban: OHH.
YOU OFFERED 40%,
I WENT UP TO 50%.
WHY, ROBERT?
IT'S HIS MONEY.
HE CAN DO -- DO WHAT HE WANTS.
HARDWORKING GIRL.
WHY WOULD YOU GO TO 50%?
O'Leary: WELL, LET -- LET ME --
LET ME MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU
TO MAKE A DECISION.
I'M OUT.
I DON'T GET THIS.
THIS STUFF TASTES LIKE CRAP.
I DON'T GET IT.
NOTHING AGAINST YOU, BUT...
YUCK.
IT'S LIKE EATING CARDBOARD.
I FINISHED MINE, SO --
BY THE WAY, I LIKED THEM.
I LIKED THEM.
YOU EITHER UNDERSTAND
THE FITNESS BENEFITS
OR YOU DON'T.
I LOOK AT
THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
AS A DISCIPLINED
FINANCIAL INVESTOR, ROBERT...
WELL...
...AND SAY THAT THIS IS
A VERY SMALL, VERTICAL MARKET.
KEVIN, YOU HAVE TO -- YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY.
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
THE "BEFORE"...
[ LAUGHS ]
...AND I'M DEFINITELY
THE "AFTER."
YOU MAY SAY THAT,
BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE MONEY.
ME TOO.
AND I THINK THIS IS
A TINY LITTLE VERTICAL OF PEOPLE
THAT LIKE TO EAT CRAPPY STUFF.
YOU GUYS ARE EARLY.
AT LEAST TASTE-WISE.
YOU'RE EARLY.
YOU'VE DONE GREAT
YOUR FIRST YEAR.
IT'S A LONG-TERM PLAY.
$120,000, 50%.
SO --
I BELIEVE
I'M THE ONLY OFFER.
ROBERT, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
BECAUSE AT -- IF --
THEY'RE BECOME--
IF THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN THERE'S AN ISSUE
AND THERE'S A CHALLENGE,
IT'S JUST AS MUCH
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS HERS.
YOU'RE -- YOU SHOULD BE EXPECTED
TO DO JUST AS MUCH WORK.
ASHLEY, JOSH, IT IS AN AMAZING
PHENOMENA IN SEASON SEVEN
WHAT'S HAPPENED
ON "SHARK TANK."
FOUR PEOPLE DROP OUT.
ONLY ONE PERSON PUTS UP
THE MONEY
THAT BELIEVES IN YOU...
BUT IF YOU HAVE A FIGHT
AT 50/50 --
...AND THEN YOU GET
A LOT OF NOISE AND CHATTER.
LISTEN, WORST SCENARIO --
YOU GO 49%,
BUT IF YOU HAVE
A FIGHT WITH HIM AT 50/50...
YEAH.
...IT CAN POTENTIALLY
BOTTLENECK THE COMPANY FOREVER.
IT'LL DESTROY THE COMPANY.
YEAH.
Greiner:
WELL, LISTEN, YOU GUYS --
O'Leary: LISTEN, IF THAT --
WHAT -- THIS IS ALL NOISE.
YOU GUYS HAVE AN OFFER.
THE ONLY GUY WRITING A CHECK
IS ROBERT RIGHT NOW.
I'M OUT, 'CAUSE I THINK
IT TASTES LIKE CRAP.
WOULD YOU DO 45%?
I WOULD DO 49%.
DAYMOND MADE A GOOD POINT.
I DON'T WANT
TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS.
I'VE DONE WELL IN THIS SPACE.
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,
WE CAN EXTEND THIS
WITH OTHER PRODUCTS.
YOU GUYS NEED TO WORK IT,
I CAN HELP YOU.
49% I'LL GO DOWN TO.
I'LL GO 42%...
OOH.
...IF YOU DO IT RIGHT NOW.
SAY YES. DON'T HESITATE.
DO IT RIGHT NOW.
I'LL DO 42%.
DONE.
THAT'S A SHARKY MOOD
RIGHT THERE.
LOOK AT THAT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MAN.
PULLING ONE OUT --
RIGHT OUT OF MY PLAYBOOK.
LOOK AT THAT.
OH, THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
YOU GOT IT.
[ GIGGLES ]
IT WAS SO EXCITING
TO HAVE DAYMOND SWOOP IN.
McClelland: YEAH.
KIND OF SAVED THE DAY THERE.
IT WAS MORE OF A RELIEF.
YEAH. WHOO!
[ LAUGHS ]
IT WAS AWESOME.
IT WAS GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU PULLED ONE
RIGHT OUT OF MY PLAYBOOK.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LIKE THEM.
I DID LIKE IT,
IT WAS JUST TOO COSTLY.
BUT I'LL BRING THE PRICE DOWN.
I DID PRO-NRG.
I'M IN THE SPACE, AS WELL,
AND --
DAYMOND, I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE
YOU KNOW ONE THING --
YOU JUST INVESTED IN
PANCAKE POO-POO ON A STICK.
Narrator: IN SEASON FOUR,
COUSINS JIM TSELIKIS
AND SABIN LOMAC MADE A DEAL
WITH BARBARA CORCORAN
FOR THEIR FOOD-TRUCK BUSINESS,
COUSINS MAINE LOBSTER.
BARBARA,
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.
LET'S SEE
HOW THEY'RE DOING NOW.
Tselikis: WE ARE BACK HOME
IN PORTLAND, MAINE,
WHERE COUSINS MAINE LOBSTER
ALL STARTED.
Both: WELCOME TO MAINE!
[ CHEERING ]
Lomac: TODAY WE'VE INVITED
11 OF OUR FRANCHISEES
FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY TO COME
FIND OUT WHAT MAINE'S ALL ABOUT,
AND WHERE WE GET
OUR LOBSTER FROM.
AND WE'VE EVEN BROUGHT IN
A SPECIAL SURPRISE.
BARBARA!
[ ALL CHEERING ]
Corcoran: I'M SO EXCITED
TO BE IN MAINE TODAY.
I GET TO MEET
ALL OF MY NEW COUSINS.
I WOULDN'T MISS THIS
FOR THE WORLD.
WE'RE HEADED OUT TO SEA WITH
SOME OF OUR LOBSTERMEN,
AND WE ARE GONNA FINISH THE DAY
AT JIM'S PARENTS' HOUSE
DOING WHAT WE DO --
EATING LOBSTER.
WHEN WE GOT INTO THE BUSINESS,
WE COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED
FRANCHISING OUR FOOD TRUCKS,
BUT IT WAS BARB'S IDEA,
AND IT WAS
HER BEST IDEA YET.
WOW!
LOOK AT THAT THING!
Tselikis:
EACH OF OUR FRANCHISEES INVEST
BETWEEN $200,000 AND $350,000
TO START A FRANCHISE
IN THEIR CITY.
IN EXCHANGE, THEY GET
A COUSINS MAINE LOBSTER TRUCK,
OUR BRANDING, AND OUR
DAILY OPERATIONAL SUPPORT.
AS THE FRANCHISE OWNER, WE
COLLECT AN ONGOING 8% ROYALTY,
AND THEY HAVE TO BUY
OUR DELICIOUS MAINE LOBSTER
DIRECTLY FROM US.
AS THE BRAND CONTINUES TO GROW,
EVERYONE BENEFITS.
TO MY NEW COUSINS,
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.
All: CHEERS!
COMING OUT TO MAINE HAS BEEN
A TRULY INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.
NOW I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS,
FROM HARVESTING THE LOBSTER
TO DELIVERING IT
TO MY CUSTOMERS ON THE TRUCK.
WE STARTED WITH ONE TRUCK
IN HOUSTON.
IT'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL, AND NOW
WE'RE ON OUR THIRD TRUCK.
IT'S AMAZING.
WE STARTED
WITH ONE FOOD TRUCK.
WE NOW HAVE 18
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
OUR TOTAL SALES
ARE $15 MILLION.
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS,
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE
WITH THE HELP OF "SHARK TANK"
AND BARB HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT THE NEXT THREE YEARS
HAS IN STORE, WHO KNOWS?
BUT WE'RE READY FOR IT.
All: WELCOME TO MAINE!
