MY NAME'S RANDY STENGER.
I'M FROM HASTINGS, MINNESOTA.
I LIVE WITH MY FIANCÈE
AND FIVE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,
AND I'M THE FOUNDER
OF EXTREME SANDBOX.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT WAS MY KIDS
THAT INSPIRED MY BUSINESS.
WE WERE DRIVING BY
A CONSTRUCTION SITE ONE DAY,
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
"DAD, WOULDN'T IT BE FUN
TO GO PLAY ON THAT STUFF?"
I'M LIKE,
"HECK, YEAH, IT WOULD BE."
AND THAT'S WHERE
MY BUSINESS STARTED.
WELCOME TO
EXTREME SANDBOX.
THANK YOU.
I'M RANDY.
EXTREME SANDBOX IS
A HEAVY-EQUIPMENT
ADVENTURE COMPANY
THAT LETS CLIENTS PLAY
ON CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT.
DRIVE DOWN
BETWEEN THE WHITE BARRICADES.
SO, WE HAVE LITERALLY
A 10-ACRE SANDBOX.
WE HAVE EXCAVATORS, BULLDOZERS.
WE CRUSH CARS OUT THERE.
WE MAKE CHILDHOOD DREAMS
COME TRUE EVERY DAY.
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU JUST COMPLETED OUR COURSE.
THE EXCAVATOR, YES.
THAT IS DEFINITELY
A GOOD CHOICE.
I LEFT A STABLE JOB
MAKING SIX FIGURES
TO START THIS COMPANY.
I USED ALMOST ALL OF MY SAVINGS
AND MY RETIREMENT ACCOUNT
JUST TO GET US OFF THE GROUND.
NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT
WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE IT
A NATIONAL BRAND.
SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE
I NEED THE SHARKS,
TO TRY AND GROW THIS
SO EVERYONE CAN EXPERIENCE IT.
THIS BUSINESS MEANS
A GREAT FUTURE FOR MY FAMILY,
AND THEY'RE ALL COUNTING ON ME
TO COME HOME WITH A DEAL.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S RANDY STENGER.
I'M FROM HASTINGS, MINNESOTA,
AND I AM THE FOUNDER AND C.E.O.
OF EXTREME SANDBOX.
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING $150,000
FOR 15% OF MY COMPANY.
SHARKS, I WANT YOU TO THINK BACK
TO YOUR CHILDHOOD DAYS.
INNOCENT, CAREFREE,
FUN-FILLED DAYS
THAT WE ALL HAVE FOND MEMORIES
OF PLAYING IN OUR SANDBOXES.
WELL, I HAVE VOWED TO REMAIN
A KID AT HEART
AND DISCOVERED
THAT THE SECRET TO YOUTH
IS TO KEEP PLAYING
IN MY SANDBOX.
HERE IS MY...
EXTREME SANDBOX.
TAKE A LOOK.
[ <i>HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS</i> ]
EXTREME SANDBOX IS
A HEAVY-EQUIPMENT
ADVENTURE COMPANY
THAT LETS CLIENTS PLAY
ON CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT.
COOL.
OOH, I LIKE THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YES, <i>YOU</i> CAN COME OUT
TO DRIVE AN EXCAVATOR
OR BULLDOZER FOR FUN.
WITH OUR SUPERSIZED
10-ACRE SANDBOX,
WE PROVIDE OUR CLIENTS
A TRULY UNIQUE,
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME,
BUCKET-LIST EXPERIENCE.
SHARKS, WE HAVE A BRAND
THAT IS REDEFINING
THE WAY ENTERTAINMENT
IS EXPERIENCED.
SO WHO'S READY TO DIG UP
SOME GOLD WITH EXTREME SANDBOX?
ALL RIGHT.
Greiner: I THINK IT'S COOL.
COOL IDEA.
I SEE
YOU'RE CRUSHING CARS.
YEP.
CAN I CRUSH A CAR?
ABSOLUTELY.
WE DO CAR CRUSHING.
WE CALL IT THE DESTRUCTION ZONE.
SO YOU CAN COME OUT
AND DEMOLISH A COUPLE --
THAT'S A -- DESTRUCTION ZONE,
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
OH, IT'S SO MUCH FUN.
HOW MUCH IS IT, RANDY?
I LIKE THAT.
I WOULD SAY OUR AVERAGE CONSUMER
PAYS ABOUT $300.
YOU KNOW, IT'S
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
KIND OF EXPERIENCE.
DO I GET TO CRUSH A CAR
FOR $300?
$400 GETS YOU A CAR CRUSH.
SO, WHAT'S YOUR --
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WE'VE DONE $1 MILLION
IN SALES IN THREE YEARS.
OH, THREE YEARS.
SO, IT'S EXPLODING.
AND WE REALLY STARTED --
OUR FIRST YEAR WAS $140,000,
JUST PART TIME,
TO TEST OUT THE CONCEPT.
THE SECOND YEAR
WAS OUR FIRST FULL-TIME YEAR.
WE DID $280,000.
AND THEN LAST YEAR,
WE DID $400,000.
AND THEN THIS YEAR,
WE'RE ON TRACK.
WE SHOULD BE AROUND $500,000,
A LITTLE OVER HALF A MILLION.
SO, RANDY, DO YOU --
AND OUR GOAL IS
TO MAKE EVERY LOCATION
A MILLION-DOLLAR LOCATION.
DO YOU OWN THE LAND?
LIKE, I'M SURPRISED
HOW CHEAP IT IS.
THEY'RE IN MINNESOTA.
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, RIGHT?
WE'RE IN A SUBURB
OF MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL,
ABOUT 25 MINUTES
FROM DOWNTOWN ST. PAUL.
BUT HASTINGS IS --
IT'S WITHIN THE --
WHERE'D YOU GET THE LAND?
THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CHALLENGES TO GET STARTED,
IS TO FIND A SITE.
YOU KNOW, A CITY
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO IT.
WE ORIGINALLY --
I STARTED VERY LOW COST,
SO I LEASED 10 ACRES OF LAND,
I LEASED A CONSTRUCTION TRAILER,
I LEASED THREE PIECES
JUST TO TEST IT OUT.
ONCE IT TOOK OFF, I BASICALLY
BOUGHT THE LAND THAT WE WERE ON.
IT WASN'T THAT EXPENSIVE.
WHAT WAS YOUR START-UP COST,
BUYING THE BULLDOZERS,
BUYING THE BACKHOES,
BUYING...
I DON'T BUY --
DIDN'T BUY A THING.
WE LEASE EVERYTHING.
SO, PEOPLE THINK I SPENT
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
ON THIS CONCEPT.
THE REALITY IS, I WAS JUST
REALLY SMART TO TEST IT OUT.
I-I HAVE A FIVE-YEAR LEASE
ON THEM.
I CAN TURN THEM RIGHT BACK IN,
AND I'M REALLY NOT OUT ANYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA COST YOU
TO OPEN UP YOUR NEXT ONE?
ROUGHLY, I'D SAY ABOUT
$100,000 TO $120,000.
RANDY,
WHERE'S THE NEXT LOCATION?
DALLAS ACTUALLY IS A MARKET
WE'RE LOOKING AT. THERE'S A --
I'VE GOT -- I'VE GOT
PLENTY OF LAND IN DALLAS.
WHAT'S THE WORST ACCIDENT
ANYBODY'S EVER HAD?
PLEASE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
NO. [ CHUCKLES ]
NEVER.
WE'VE NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT.
WE DO HAVE REMOTE ENGINE CUTOFFS
IN OUR GARAGE.
WE'VE NEVER EVEN
HAD TO USE THEM.
SO, YOU -- WHY DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY?
DO YOU WANT
TO GROW FASTER, THEN?
EXACTLY. I WANT --
I NEED IT TO GO FASTER.
I'VE USED EVERYTHING WE'VE MADE
SO FAR TO REINVEST IT.
I ENDED UP BUYING THE LAND,
BUILT A FACILITY.
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE CASH.
RANDY, WHAT IS YOUR --
YOUR, UH, HISTORY?
ARE YOU A -- WERE YOU
TRADITIONALLY IN THIS BUSINESS?
UH, I-I DON'T HAVE ANY
BACKGROUND IN CONSTRUCTION.
I WAS A POLICE OFFICER
FOR FIVE YEARS OUT IN COLORADO,
AND THEN I WANTED TO GET OUT
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
I WANTED TO GET SOMETHING MORE
STABLE ONCE I STARTED A FAMILY.
WE MOVED BACK TO THE MIDWEST
'CAUSE I WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN WISCONSIN.
Greiner: HOW DO YOU SEE
YOURSELF SCALING THIS?
WHAT'S YOUR VISION
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS?
I SEE HAVING ONE OF THESE IN
EVERY METRO AREA IN THE U.S.
I MEAN, MAYBE --
I SHOULD SAY MAYBE 10 OR SO.
WHAT I SEE IS US
ACTUALLY CENTRALIZING
ALL THE FRONT-END PROCESS.
I WOULD SAY ABOUT 30% OF OUR
WORKLOAD IS PURELY, YOU KNOW,
ANSWERING CLIENT CALLS
AND MAKING RESERVATIONS,
SELLING GIFT CERTIFICATES,
YOU KNOW,
SOCIAL-MEDIA MANAGEMENT.
ALL OF THAT CAN BE DONE
FROM THE TWIN CITIES
FOR MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.
IF YOU GOT THE RESERVATION RATE
UP OR YOU GOT MORE BOOKINGS,
HOW MUCH REVENUE
COULD THIS MODEL PRODUCE?
EACH LOCATION, I WOULD SAY,
COULD DO $1 MILLION
FAIRLY EASILY.
SO, YOU KNOW,
I COULD SEE HOW THIS COULD BE
REALLY, REALLY FUN.
YEP.
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
INSIDE SEVERAL OF THESE.
AN EXCAVATOR WOULD SELL GREAT
ON QVC!
LISTEN, LISTEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK, UM, PEOPLE WOULD,
YOU KNOW,
JUST LOVE TO HAVE
THE EXPERIENCE.
IT'S --
THE --
IT'S A LOT OF FUN,
I'M SURE.
BUT I'M NOT SURE
HOW YOU'LL SCALE THIS.
SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
OKAY, SO, UM...
YEAH, I FIND IT FASCINATING.
ONLY 'CAUSE I THINK,
UH, LAST YEAR,
I WAS WALKING
ON A BEACH IN MIAMI,
THEY WERE DOING CONSTRUCTION,
AND THEY WERE MOVING THE SAND.
AND I FOUND THAT I STOOD THERE
LOOKING AT THAT CONSTRUCTION
FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS.
AND I, UH --
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.
THAT'S THE --
I WAS FASCINATED BY IT.
IT TOOK ME BACK TO A TIME
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID
AND I WAS EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.
UM...
WE FULFILL DREAMS OUT THERE.
IT'S THE BEST THING.
I LOVE WHAT WE DO.
YEAH.
AND SO I GET THE APPEAL.
I JUST DON'T THINK
I COULD ADD ANY VALUE.
I'M OUT.
COME ON.
SOMEONE WANTS TO PLAY.
I-I DON'T HAVE ONE OF THESE
IN MY PORTFOLIO.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE CAN DIG UP ALL THAT MONEY
YOU WANT TO GET.
I JUST
DON'T HAVE ONE OF THESE.
SORT OF A...
WE CAN MAKE THIS --
THIS WILL BE HUGE.
...VARIENTIAL...
IF YOU LOOK AT ANY --
MR. WONDERFUL'S [LAUGHS]
I MEAN, EVEN SIX FLAGS
OR DISNEY WORLD
ALWAYS STARTED
AS A SMALL ATTRACTION.
YEAH.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS
HEAVY-EQUIPMENT SPACE,
WE'RE GONNA OWN.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, YOU KNOW,
RANDY, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,
I GET IT.
I DEFINITELY WANT
TO CRUSH A CAR.
LIKE, I'M DOING THAT
WHATEVER HAPPENS.
UM...I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $150,000 FOR 20%.
BASICALLY CLOSE
TO WHAT YOU ASKED FOR,
AND THEN YOU DECIDE
WHERE TO OPEN THE NEXT ONE.
I WISH YOU'D DO IT
NEAR BOSTON,
'CAUSE I WOULD WANT
TO CRUSH SOME CARS NEAR THERE.
ABSOLUTELY BE OPEN TO THAT.
SOME OF
MY COMPETITORS' CARS.
I LIKE THE IDEA OF JUST PICKING
THEM UP AND CRUSHING THEM.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Herjavec: RANDY, FROM
A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE,
I THINK YOUR CHALLENGE
IS GONNA BE SCALE.
I-I DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT
YOU'RE GONNA OPEN UP ONE.
I-I THINK I WOULD'VE LIKED
TO HEAR YOU SAY,
"FOR $150,000, WE'RE GONNA
OPEN UP FOUR AND ADVERTISE,"
OR SOMETHING
ALONG THAT WAY.
AND I'M NOT PASSIONATE
ABOUT
HEAVY, UH,
CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT.
UM...
AND IT SEEMS KEVIN IS.
HE LIKES TO BURY HIS MONEY.
I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND, ROBERT.
THANK YOU.
OKAY, I HAPPEN
TO LIKE THIS IDEA,
AND I LIKE THE FACT
THAT I HAVE LAND.
THIS IS THE SEVENTH SEASON
OF "SHARK TANK,"
AND I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING I
NEVER, EVER THOUGHT I WOULD DO.
IF YOU CAN CONVINCE MR. WONDER--
OH, I EVEN SAID THAT WORD.
OKAY.
[ LAUGHS ]
IF YOU CAN CONVINCE KEVIN,
UM, TO LET ME COME IN HALF
ON HIS DEAL, THEN I'LL DO IT.
AND THEN --
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH
GOING CRAZY WITH IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL DO --
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
I'LL DO THAT DEAL,
'CAUSE I THINK...
IS IT STILL 20%?
YEAH.
...THE LAND MATTERS,
AND OBVIOUSLY MARK KNOWS
A LOT OF GUYS IN DALLAS.
THAT'S HELPFUL.
I KNOW -- I KNOW
A LOT OF GUYS IN BOSTON.
I'D LIKE
TO SET ONE UP THERE, TOO.
I'LL DO THAT DEAL.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
DO YOU SEE AS WE --
AS LIKE ROBERT SAID --
YOU'RE STILL TALKING?
I JUST WANT TO KNOW,
WITH ACCELERATING GROWTH...
YEAH?
...IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
OF COURSE.
YOU GUYS HAVE A DEAL.
WOW.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: CONGRATS.
FIRST FOR EVERYTHING.
SO EXCITING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
IT WAS FUN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'M COMING OUT THERE
TO CRUSH A CAR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHY DID YOU LET KEVIN IN
ON THAT DEAL?
THANK YOU, GUYS.
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S STILL...
THANK YOU.
...KIND OF GOT THE HIVES FROM
DOING A DEAL WITH KEVIN,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.
DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?
YES! THAT'S SO AWESOME!
THIS IS SO COOL.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT BOTH MARK
AND MR. WONDERFUL IN THAT DEAL.
UH, THIS IS GONNA BE
A GAME CHANGER FOR US.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A FEDERAL AGENT
WITH A WAY TO ALWAYS LOOK SHARP
AND IN CONTROL.
