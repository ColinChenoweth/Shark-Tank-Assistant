HELLO, EVERYONE.
MY NAME IS DWIGHT LITTLEJOHN.
AND I'M A SPECIAL AGENT
WITH A FEDERAL AGENCY
BASED IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
I'M SEEKING $50,000 IN RETURN
FOR 25% OF MY PRODUCT,
THE TOTAL TIE KEEP.
NOW, MY CAREER
AS A FEDERAL AGENT
REQUIRES ME TO WEAR A SUIT AND
A NECKTIE JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY,
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M USUALLY IN THE COMPANY
OF SOME OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
AND IT CAN BE QUITE A CHALLENGE
TRYING TO MAINTAIN
A NEAT, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE.
NOW, IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT
TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION
WHEN YOU SUFFER
FROM BAD NECKTIE BEHAVIORS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SUCH AS...
THE BLOWING BENNY.
THAT'S WHEN THE WIND TAKES YOUR
TIE, WHIPS IT ACROSS YOUR FACE,
AND YOU'RE FIGHTING IT,
TRYING TO KEEP IT DOWN.
NEXT EXAMPLE IS THE PEEPING TOM.
THAT'S WHEN THAT REAR APRON
WANTS TO PEEP OUT
AND JUST BE A PART
OF WHATEVER'S GOING ON.
NEXT IS THE MESSY MARVIN.
O'Leary: NASTY.
THAT'S CHICKEN PARMESAN.
THAT'S A TRUE STORY.
[ LAUGHS ]
THE TOTAL TIE KEEP IS
THE ULTIMATE NECKTIE ACCESSORY
THAT CORRECTS, STRAIGHTENS,
AND CONTROLS THE TIE.
TIE BARS ARE VERY FANCY,
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
THEY MAY OVER-STIFFEN THE TIE
AND TAKE AWAY THAT NATURAL FLOW.
SO, SHARKS, JOIN ME IN
STRAIGHTENING AMERICA'S TIES
WITH THE ULTIMATE
NECKTIE ACCESSORY,
THE TOTAL TIE KEEP.
I'M GONNA PASS OUT
SOME SAMPLES TO YOU.
OUTSTANDING.
Cuban:
WHICH FEDERAL AGENCY?
UM...I'M NOT AT LIBERTY
TO SAY.
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: IS IT
SECRET SERVICE? IS IT FBI?
I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHEN WE'RE SIGNING A DEAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UH, THE PACKAGE
IS MY BASIC COLLECTION.
IT'S FOUR DIFFERENT COLORS,
AND THOSE COLORS
CAN BE WORN TO...
OH, I SEE.
...COORDINATE WITH
THE TIE OR THE SHIRT.
THAT'S COOL.
FIRST, YOU JUST WANT TO PUT YOUR
TIE ON LIKE YOU NORMALLY DO,
TURN IT OVER,
AND YOU FIND THE TIE LOOP.
YOU WANT TO COUNT UP TWO BUTTONS
FROM THIS TIE LOOP -- ONE, TWO.
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT
TO ATTACH THE TIE KEEP TO.
NOW, YOU WANT TO TAKE
THIS REAR APRON
AND TUCK IT IN THIS UPPER LOOP,
RIGHT -- KABAM.
SO, THE NEXT STEP
YOU WANT TO DO,
YOU TAKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE DEVICE
AND TUCK IT BEHIND THE TIE LOOP.
AND THEN YOU WANT
TO SECURE THAT.
AND THEN YOU CAN SECURE
THE MIDDLE BUTTON, ALSO,
JUST TO GIVE IT
AN EXTRA BIT OF SECURITY.
THAT'S SLICK.
AW. THAT'S COOL.
WHY DIDN'T
<i>YOU</i> THINK OF THAT?
AND THERE YOU GO.
O'Leary: THAT'S VERY COOL.
Herjavec:
SO, DWIGHT, I GOT TO KNOW.
UH-HUH?
THERE YOU ARE
GUARDING SOMEBODY, HIGH SECRET,
REALLY SENSITIVE,
AND YOU'RE THINKING,
"MAN, I GOT TO COME UP WITH
A TIE-CLIP IDEA."
WELL, JUST --
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH
THE IDEA?
WELL, GOING THROUGH JUST
DAY-TO-DAY WORK, SEEING PEOPLE,
MEETING OTHER AGENTS
FROM DIFFERENT AGENCIES,
I MEAN, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE
IS WHAT WE CALL
COMMAND PRESENCE.
THAT'S THAT SENSE
OF WALKING INTO A ROOM
AND JUST KIND OF CONTROLLING
THE ROOM WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.
AND OBVIOUSLY
YOU HAVE TO LOOK THE PART
IN ABLE FOR THAT
TO BE EFFECTIVE.
DWIGHT, WOULD YOU GIVE ONE
TO KEVIN?
'CAUSE HE'S DOING
THE PEEPING TOM RIGHT NOW.
YEAH, THAT'S --
THAT'S -- THAT'S --
I CAN SEE IT RIGHT HERE.
THAT'S FOR KEVIN.
I LOOK SPECTACULAR
ALL THE TIME.
THAT -- THAT'S FOR YOU.
THOSE ARE FOR YOU.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
THEY RETAIL FOR $25
FOR A PACK OF FOUR,
UM, AND IT ONLY COSTS ME
A LITTLE UNDER $3.
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY?
ARE YOU ALREADY SELLING THEM?
NOT REALLY.
THIS IS THE TRICKY PART,
AND THIS IS WHY I'M HERE.
YOU GOT A JOB, AND --
[ LAUGHS ]
EXACTLY. IT'S -- IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO FIND TIME
TO GET INTO IT
LIKE I WANT TO.
OKAY, SO, YOU'RE COMING IN
WITH A CONCEPT...
WELL...
...SO TO SPEAK.
AND IT'S PATENTED,
OBVIOUSLY.
IT'S PATENTED.
UM, I HAVE SOLD SOME
ON-- ONLINE.
I GIVE A LOT OF THEM AWAY
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
THAT ASSIST ME ON THE ROAD.
AND I HAVE SOLD SOME TO --
DO THEY WEAR THEM?
THEY DO.
THEY ABSOLUTELY DO.
AND I HAVE, UM, PRETTY MUCH
EXHAUSTED MY SALES CIRCLE,
SO TO SPEAK.
John: HAVE YOU TRIED TO PUT THIS
IN ANY RETAIL?
I DID. I ACTUALLY WENT INTO A --
I WALKED INTO A MEN'S WEARHOUSE.
UH-HUH.
UM, THEY HOOKED ME UP WITH
THEIR TIE-ACCESSORY GUY,
AND I ENDED UP GETTING
200 UNITS SOLD,
AND THEN THEY PUT IT
ON THEIR WEBSITE FOR TESTING.
HOW DID THEY SELL?
BUT THEY DIDN'T --
THEY DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB.
THE PUT IT ON A BACK PAGE.
UM, AND OBVIOUSLY THIS NEEDS
TO BE EXPLAINED,
AS FAR AS
ALL OF THE ADVANTAGES IT HAS.
I THINK -- I THINK
YOUR BIGGER PROBLEM IS
YOU WENT TO THE BIGGEST COMPANY
IN THE SPACE...
INSTEAD OF LITTLE.
...INSTEAD OF ANY OF THESE
SPECIALTY STORES,
BECAUSE THE MORE THEY SELL,
THE MORE YOU MAKE,
THE MORE THEY MAKE,
THEY RE-ORDER QUICKLY.
YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE LIKE
A BIG MEN'S WEARHOUSE,
THAT'S A HUGE SYSTEM.
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?
AND --
AND I THINK THAT, UM,
YOU PROBABLY WENT TO
THE WRONG COMPANY.
THIS IS -- THIS IS WHY
I NEED YOU GUYS.
YOU NEED US
'CAUSE YOU GOT NO SALES.
Herjavec: DWIGHT,
HOW WOULD THIS WORK?
YOU HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB.
MM-HMM.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA QUIT
YOUR FULL-TIME JOB.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR $50,000.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE MONEY?
LIKE -- LIKE -- WHERE'S --
WHO'S GONNA GO OUT AND SELL IT?
EVEN IF YOU GOT
THE $50,000,
TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW.
WELL, IF -- IF I GOT
THE $50,000,
I WOULD USE THAT
TO BUY MORE PRODUCT.
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY, WITH YOUR
INVESTMENT, I WOULD EXPECT --
NO, I GOT IT.
BUT WHO'S GONNA SELL IT?
WELL, I WOULD EXPECT --
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
THAT'S WHY I CAME IN ASKING FOR
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY
FOR A HIGHER PERCENTAGE
OF THE COMPANY,
HOPING TO GET ASSISTANCE
FROM YOU ALL.
BUT, DWIGHT,
SOMEONE'S GOT TO WORK THERE.
I MEAN, THERE'S ALWAYS --
SOMEONE'S GOT TO BE AT THAT
BUSINESS EVERY SINGLE DAY.
YEAH, I --
WHO'S IT GONNA BE?
WELL, I-IT COULD BE ME
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.
UM, BUT THAT'S WHEN I NEED
SOME OF YOU GUYS
TO KIND OF STEP IN --
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE UP YOUR
FULL-TIME GIG.
I MEAN,
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA,
AND A PRODUCT THAT'S MISSING
THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
THAT'S KIND OF WHY I WANT TO GET
INTO LICENSING, ALSO.
I MEAN, THAT'S ALWAYS
A POSSIBILITY.
LOOK --
YOU KNOW, I JUST --
I JUST NEED --
THERE'S -- THERE'S NO
INFRASTRUCTURE...
I JUST NEED HELP.
Greiner: YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE DOING THIS.
I NEED HELP.
YOU REALLY WANT SOMEBODY
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE IT OVER.
WHETHER LICENSING, WHETHER THEY
BUY YOU OUT, WHATEVER IT IS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN THIS
DAY TO DAY.
I-I CAN'T AT THIS
PARTICULAR POINT IN MY LIFE.
THE REASON I DON'T WEAR A TIE
IS MY FIRST COMPANY,
MicroSolutions, I BOUGHT
MY FIRST SUITS TWO FOR $99.
ALL THE TIES
THAT I BOUGHT WERE USED.
I COULDN'T AFFORD
TO BUY A NEW TIE.
I HAD TO WEAR A TIE EVERY
SINGLE DAY THAT I WENT TO WORK.
THE MINUTE I SOLD
THAT COMPANY, I SAID,
"I'M NOT WEARING ANOTHER DARN
TIE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE."
[ CHUCKLES ]
TO ME, SWAG ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT I WEAR.
SWAG IS ME BEING ABLE
TO TELL EVERYBODY AROUND ME
WHAT TO WEAR.
I'M NOT THE RIGHT GUY.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
TO MARK'S POINT,
I'M NOT THE RIGHT PARTNER HERE.
I CANNOT RELATE AT ALL
TO TIES.
I HAVE ZERO EXPERIENCE
THERE.
I'M NOT THE RIGHT PARTNER
FOR YOU.
I WISH YOU LUCK,
BUT I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I MEAN,
I'VE TAKEN IT THIS FAR.
I MEAN, THAT HAS TO COUNT
FOR SOMETHING, RIGHT?
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU'VE INVENTED
A PRODUCT WITH NO SALES,
SO THE QUESTION IS...
I HAVE SALES.
THEY'RE JUST NOT OFFICIAL.
...YOU'RE ASKING A VALUATION OF
$200,000 FOR IT RIGHT NOW.
I THINK I'D HAVE TO GET 116%
OF THE COMPANY
FOR THE $50,000
YOU'RE ASKING FOR.
WELL, THAT -- THAT VALUATION
IS BASED ON SOMETHING.
IT'S NOT ANYTHING
I JUST THREW OUT THERE.
WHAT IS IT BASED ON?
WHAT -- WHAT IS IT?
WELL, I HAVE, UH, ABOUT
5,200 BOXES,
AND THEY CAN RETAIL
FROM ANYWHERE BETWEEN
$50,000 AND $100,000.
YEAH,
BUT THEY'RE NOT RETAILING.
DWIGHT --
BUT I HAVEN'T --
ONCE I START MAKING AN EFFORT
TO GET IT THERE,
I-I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THEY CAN.
DWIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA SELL OUT
OF THE INVENTORY YOU HAVE
WHEN PEOPLE SEE IT PARTLY 'CAUSE
IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT,
PARTLY BECAUSE
YOU'RE A GREAT GUY
AND YOU COME ACROSS
REALLY WELL.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
STARTING A BUSINESS
ISN'T A PART-TIME JOB.
A-AND --
YOU CAN'T BE A WANT-TREPRENEUR.
YEAH, I'M --
I HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB.
I CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU.
AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW,
I WI-- I WISH YOU THE BEST,
BUT YOU KIND OF
CAN'T DO BOTH.
YEAH.
I'M OUT.
GOTCHA.
O'Leary: MY PROBLEM IS,
I'M IN IT FOR THE MONEY.
I GIVE YOU $50,000,
NEXT MONTH I CALL YOU SAYING,
"HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE I MADE?"
AND YOU SAY,
"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"
[ CUBAN LAUGHS ]
YOU TELL ME, "IF YOU ASK ME
THIS AGAIN, I'LL ARREST YOU."
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T LIKE THAT OUTCOME.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS,
IT'S A HOBBY,
AND IT HAS NO SALES.
I'M OUT.
DWIGHT, I CAN'T HAVE MY MONEY
BECOME TUITION
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED
ANYTHING OUT JUST YET.
AT THIS STAGE,
I HAVE TO BE OUT.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD LUCK, DWIGHT.
GOOD LUCK.
I APPRECIATE IT.
ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE.
I UNDERSTAND
THAT THE SALES AREN'T GREAT,
BUT I'M LEARNING
AS I MOVE FORWARD,
AND I'M GETTING BETTER AT IT.
AND AS I GET BETTER,
MY COMPANY WILL GET BETTER,
AND MY SALES WILL GET BETTER.
DO YOU GUYS LIKE IT?
Cuban: YES.
WOULD YOU BUY IT?
NO.
I'M GONNA USE IT.
THE RARE TIMES
I HAVE TO WEAR A TIE,
I'M GONNA USE IT.
THE PROBLEM IS IT COSTS MORE
THAN CUBAN'S SUITS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT MUCH MORE.
