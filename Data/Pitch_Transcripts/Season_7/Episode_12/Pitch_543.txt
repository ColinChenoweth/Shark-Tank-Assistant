HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS PETER THORPE.
I AM THE CREATOR AND FOUNDER
OF FireAvert.
I AM SEEKING $300,000
FOR A 7% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
I'M A FIREFIGHTER AND...
...AN ENTREPRENEUR.
SHARKS, EVERY
FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES,
FIREFIGHTERS JUST LIKE ME
RESPOND TO A HOME FIRE
BECAUSE SOMEBODY FORGOT
ABOUT THE FOOD
COOKING ON THE STOVE.
THAT'S WHY I CREATED FireAvert.
FireAvert IS A SIMPLE DEVICE
THAT ANYONE CAN INSTALL.
YOU SIMPLY PLUG YOUR STOVE
INTO FireAvert,
FireAvert IN THE WALL,
AND IT'S READY TO GO.
WHEN THE SMOKE ALARM SOUNDS
FROM THE FOOD STARTING TO BURN,
FireAvert WILL HEAR
YOUR SMOKE ALARM,
CUT POWER TO YOUR STOVE,
ELIMINATE THE HEAT SOURCE,
AND PREVENT ANY POSSIBLE
FIRE FROM STARTING.
LET ME DEMONSTRATE THIS
FOR YOU NOW.
[ SMOKE ALARM BEEPING ]
Herjavec: OH.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
FireAvert WAS ABLE
TO HEAR THE SOUND
OF YOUR SMOKE ALARM
AND TURN OFF THE STOVE
BEFORE THERE WAS ANY FIRE.
SO, SHARKS, WHO WANTS
TO PROTECT PROPERTY
AND SAVE LIVES WITH FireAvert?
IT'S VERY INTERESTING.
LET ME GET LORI HERS.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
PETER, IN YOUR EXAMPLE,
IT TURNED IT OFF,
WHICH WAS GREAT.
BUT FOR THE SMOKE ALARM
TO GO OFF,
WOULDN'T THERE ALREADY BE
A LOT OF SMOKE,
AND THE FIRE ALREADY GOING
ON THE STOVE?
SO, GREAT QUESTION.
WE -- AS -- AS A FIREFIGHTER,
FROM MY EXPERIENCE,
AND FROM NUMEROUS TESTS, WE KNOW
THAT SMOKE PRECEDES FIRE.
I'VE BEEN ON DOZENS OF CALLS
WHERE THERE IS NO FIRE,
IT'S JUST SMOKE DAMAGE.
THIS IS THE NUMBER-ONE CAUSE
OF HOME FIRES IN THE U.S.
WE ARE PREVENTION.
DOES IT WORK FOR GAS?
FOR RIGHT NOW, WE ONLY WORK
FOR ELECTRIC STOVES.
WHY ONLY STOVES?
THAT'S THE NUMBER-ONE CAUSE
OF HOME FIRES IN THE U.S.
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN SELLING THIS?
WE'VE BEEN ON THE MARKET
FOR 18 MONTHS.
AND HOW'S IT GOING?
AND HOW MUCH IS IT?
IT MSRPs FOR $195.
$195?
$195.
WOW.
I'M SURPRISED.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A LOT LESS.
Greiner: I DID, TOO.
A LOT LESS.
I THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE...
29 BUCKS.
HOW MUCH
DO YOU MAKE IT FOR?
WE MAKE THIS FOR $45.
DANG.
WOW.
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE VALUE.
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S WORTH
ROUGHLY $4.5 MILLION TODAY.
YEAH.
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THAT?
SO, I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HIT
AT LEAST $2 MILLION THIS YEAR.
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU MAKE
ON THE $2 MILLION?
RIGHT NOW, THIS YEAR,
WE HAVE A 37% NET PROFIT.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE $750,000.
YES.
DAMN!
PETER, YOU ARE ON FIRE.
HOW IS THE WORD GETTING OUT
THAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
YEAH, SO, WE SELL DIRECT
TO MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING
AND SENIOR-HOUSING FACILITIES.
IF YOU CAN IMAGINE, THESE
MULTI-FAMILY-HOUSING OWNERS
THAT ARE HAVING A STOVE FIRE
ONCE A QUARTER
IN THEIR PORTFOLIO,
IT'S A HUGE PAIN POINT FOR THEM,
AND WE CAN SHOW
THEM THE SOLUTION.
IT'S A NO-BRAINER FOR THEM.
DO YOU OWN
THE COMPANY YOURSELF?
I STARTED IT.
I OWN JUST UNDER
30% OF THE COMPANY NOW.
OHH.
YOU OWN WHAT?
WAIT, YOU OWN JUST 30%?
CORRECT.
OH.
WHO OWNS THE REST, PETER?
SO, WHEN I HAD THE IDEA --
I'M A FIREFIGHTER, RIGHT?
AND SO I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
AND WE TOOK SOME EARLY FRIENDS,
TOOK SOME INVESTMENTS,
THEY OWN A PART OF IT.
PETER, WHO IS THE LARGEST
SHAREHOLDER OF YOUR COMPANY?
IS IT YOU
OR ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS?
ONE OF MY FRIENDS.
HOW MUCH DOES YOUR FRIEND OWN,
A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL?
UH, ONE OF THEM OWNS 60%.
OHH.
I NEEDED CASH, AND I WAS PAYING
FOR THE BUSINESS OUT OF POCKET.
THE BUSINESS IS BURNING MONEY,
RIGHT?
AND I WAS TO THE POINT
WHERE WE WERE PRE-SALES.
I GOT FOUR KIDS,
AND I WAS PUTTING MY MORTGAGE
ON A CREDIT CARD.
I HAD PUT ALL MY SAVINGS
INTO IT.
I -- I WAS STRESSING. I --
YOU WERE STUCK.
I FEEL LIKE HE SAVED ME.
THAT'S FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T THINK HE SAVED YOU.
AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,
IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW A LOT,
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME
TRY TO GET 50% OR 51%.
AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT --
BECAUSE I THINK
THE ENTREPRENEUR HAS TO HAVE
ENOUGH STAKE IN THE GAME.
OTHERWISE, THERE'LL BE A POINT
OF DIMINISHING RETURNS
WHERE YOU QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORTH IT,
OR YOU'LL LOOK
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
BECAUSE
YOU'RE AN ENTREPRENEUR.
AND SO I THINK THAT'S
GONNA BE AN ISSUE HERE,
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE,
YOU BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR
TO SAVE LIVES
AS WELL AS MAKE MONEY.
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, GIVING AWAY,
UM, 70% OF YOUR COMPANY
AT THE EARLY STAGES, NOW YOU
HAVE LIMITED TO PLAY WITH.
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
I THINK THAT I WOULD MAKE IT
JUST MORE PRESSURE ON YOU.
SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
Greiner: WELL, LISTEN.
I AGREE WITH DAYMOND.
YOU WERE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE
WHERE YOU GAVE AWAY A LOT
FOR A LITTLE.
BUT YOU WERE STUCK,
SO YOU DID IT.
NOW YOU'RE IN
A POSITION AGAIN
WHERE YOU'RE GIVING AWAY
MORE OF YOUR COMPANY, RIGHT?
SO, I-I PERSONALLY FEEL
THAT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE
MORE OF YOUR COMPANY.
I DON'T FEEL RIGHT
ABOUT IT.
GOOD LUCK.
BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
REALLY SMALL, YOU GOT TO HANG ON
TO AS MUCH EQUITY
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
I WANT TO GET INVOLVED,
BUT 5%, 7%,
JUST NOT THAT INTERESTED.
SO, MAKE AN OFFER.
TELL ME WHAT YOU GUYS THINK
IT WOULD BE WORTH
FOR YOU GUYS GETTING UP
AND BEING PART OF THIS COMPANY.
I BELIEVE IN THIS PRODUCT.
I FEEL THAT THIS IS GONNA BE
IN EVERY HOME ACROSS AMERICA.
WE ALL BELIEVE IN THIS,
WE JUST DON'T --
IT'S NOT A QUESTION
ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
YEAH.
THE PRODUCT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
IT'S THE DEAL.
WE ALL LIKE THE PRODUCT.
OKAY, HOW ABOUT --
SO, WHAT -- WHAT DEAL
MAKES SENSE?
PETER,
HOW ABOUT THIS DEAL?
IS THERE...
HOW ABOUT THIS DEAL?
I BUY OUT YOUR FRIEND'S 60%
FOR $300,000
AND GIVE YOU
51% VOTING CONTROL.
HE'S GONE.
I'LL BE THE 60% GUY.
Narrator: THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
EVERYONE IS CONCERNED
PETER GAVE AWAY TOO MUCH
OF HIS FIRE-PREVENTION COMPANY,
FireAvert,
TO A PREVIOUS INVESTOR.
BUT KEVIN HAS
A UNIQUE PROPOSITION.
O'Leary:
HOW ABOUT THIS DEAL?
I BUY OUT YOUR FRIEND'S 60%
FOR $300,000
AND GIVE YOU
51% VOTING CONTROL.
I'LL GIVE YOU, IN MY DEAL --
I'LL TAKE OUT YOUR FRIEND.
I SIT IN HIS SHOES.
I NOW HAVE 60%.
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO CONTROL YOUR COMPANY.
John: SO, HIS FRIEND
IS GONNA SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE.
WE'RE GONNA CLEAR $750,000,"
UH, YOU KNOW --
THAT HE OWNS 60% OF,
RIGHT?
YEAH, YOUR FRIEND IS NOT GONNA
BE A FRIEND ANYMORE.
John: I OWN 60% OF THAT.
YEAH, BUT HIS FRIEND
RIGHT NOW --
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK.
WITH THIS FRIEND, ALSO, HE'S
A VERY STRATEGIC PARTNER, TOO.
Cuban: WHAT'S HIS NAME?
UH, JEFF.
HE'S A MULTI-FAMILY-HOUSING
OWNER HIMSELF,
AND SO HE'S BEEN ABLE
TO -- TO OPEN DOORS FOR ME.
HE'S VERY STRATEGIC.
HE'S GOT ME
SO MUCH NETWORKING OUT THERE.
BUT YOU DO UNDERSTAND
HE OWNS 60%
SO THAT HE CAN MAKE
THE FINAL DECISION?
WHY ARE WE EVEN
TALKING ABOUT THIS
WHEN JEFF ISN'T HERE
AND HE CAN'T SELL JEFF OUT?
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
A CONTINGENCY.
I'M ASKING.
IT'LL BE A CONTINGENCY.
BECAUSE WHAT IT GETS YOU BACK
IS CONTROL OF YOUR COMPANY.
I'M -- I AM YOUR FRIEND.
THAT'S WHY I'M --
WHY WOULD JEFF SELL OUT 60%
FOR $300,000?
MAYBE HE WANTS
LIQUIDITY.
HOW MUCH DID HE SPEND?
$50,000.
WOW.
WOW.
O'Leary: HE GAVE YOU $50,000.
I'M NOW OFFERING HIM $300,000
FOR HIS $50,000.
TOTAL LIQUIDITY.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL HIM?
LET'S FIND OUT.
PETER, I'LL MAKE YOU
A BETTER OFFER THAN KEVIN
ON THE SAME TERMS.
I'LL GIVE YOU $400,000
FOR THAT 60%,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU BACK
THE VOTING RIGHTS, ALSO.
I DON'T NEED
TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS.
I'LL GIVE YOU
VOTING CONTROL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S GO CALL JEFF.
I'M GONNA TALK TO JEFF.
LET'S DO IT.
I'M HERE WITH PETER.
SAY HI, PETER.
HEY, JEFF. HOW ARE YOU?
JEFF: Good. Hey, Peter.
Hey, Mark.
THE QUESTION
THAT WE ALL HAD WAS,
WITH PETER ONLY HAVING
30% LEFT,
IT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT
DIFFICULT FOR US TO INVEST
BECAUSE HE'D BE DILUTED,
AND WE WERE CONCERNED
WITH THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY
HE'D HAVE AFTER A DEAL.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SELL
ANY OF YOUR EQUITY
DIRECTLY AS PART OF THIS DEAL
SO THAT THE MONEY WENT TO YOU
SO THAT PETER WOULD BE ABLE
TO RETAIN HIS EQUITY?
REALLY WHAT IT'S COME DOWN TO,
THERE'S KEVIN
AND, UM, ROBERT ARE LOOKING
AT MAKING OFFERS.
KEVIN'S OFFER WAS $300,000
TO BUY YOUR EQUITY DIRECTLY,
AND THE SECOND OPTION WAS
FROM ROBERT, HE'D GIVE $400,000.
I know Robert and Kevin are
obviously accomplished guys,
but I highly doubt they would be
more strategic in this business
than I am.
I'M GONNA LET YOU TALK
TO, UM, PETER,
AND LET YOU GUYS
FIGURE IT OUT
AND DECIDE IF YOU WANT
TO COUNTER OR NOT.
Sounds good.
THANK YOU.
Thanks.
I THINK IT IS CRAZY
THEY WANT TO OFFER
$300,000, $400,000
FOR ALL YOUR EQUITY.
Well, don't let
the bright lights
have us do a dumb deal.
Herjavec:
SO, WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
DOES HE WANT
TO SELL HIS POSITION?
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE DISCUSSING.
OKAY, PETER, BEFORE YOU START,
JUST TO SUMMARIZE HERE
SO I AM CLEAR ON WHAT
THE SITUATION IS WITH JEFF --
HE GAVE YOU $50,000
AND GOT 60% OF THE COMPANY.
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.
I'LL BUY JEFF'S POSITION,
THE ENTIRE 60%, FOR $300,000.
IS HE INTERESTED
IN DOING THAT?
JEFF SAID HE WILL NOT SELL
HIS FULL EQUITY FOR $300,000.
HE WANTS TO STAY IN THE GAME.
WE WANT TO DILUTE EQUALLY.
SO, HE'S NOT OPPOSED
TO DILUTING,
BUT HE WON'T SELL
ANY OF HIS SHARES DIRECTLY.
YES.
I HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN THAT.
I'M OUT.
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I'M OUT, TOO.
LORI, I WISH YOU WERE STILL IN,
BECAUSE I THINK --
I THINK WE CAN SELL
A LOT OF THESE ON QVC.
THERE IS A HUGE MARKET OUT THERE
FOR PEOPLE BUYING THESE
FOR THEIR PARENTS,
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT
THEIR PARENTS AGING AND PLACE.
I TOLD YOU MY COST RIGHT NOW
IS $45.
I KNOW FOR A FACT WE CAN GET
THE COST OF THIS DOWN TO $20.
AND THEN WHAT
WOULD YOU SELL IT FOR?
WE COULD SALE THIS RETAIL
FOR $99 ON QVC OR OTHER PLACES.
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING ME?
SO -- SO, LORI --
YOU CAME BACK IN HERE,
AND YOU LOOKED AT ME.
YEAH.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT'S YOUR OFFER TO ME?
LORI --
I'M INTERESTED.
SO, $300,000 --
WHAT ABOUT $300,000 FOR 12%?
I WOULD DO IT THIS WAY
INSTEAD.
THIS IS BASED ON THAT
YOU GET THE UNIT PRICE DOWN.
I WOULD GO $300,000 AS A LOAN,
5% INTEREST.
JUST GIVE ME 15% ROYALTY
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK.
AND THEN,
WHEN I GOT BACK MY $300,000,
I WOULD HAVE
THE 12% STAKE.
O'Leary: I CAN BEAT THAT OFFER
IN A BIG WAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $300,000,
ALSO AS A LOAN,
I'LL TAKE A 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK $900,000.
MY ROYALTY GOES AWAY.
UNTIL $900,000.
AND I ONLY WANT --
I ONLY WANT 5% OF YOUR EQUITY.
LORI, $300,000, 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL YOU'RE PAID BACK,
AND THEN YOU OWN 10% EQUITY.
WE'RE GONNA DO
$2 MILLION THIS YEAR.
WE'VE ALREADY DONE $1.5 MILLION.
$300,000 LOAN.
10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I'M PAID BACK $400,000.
THEN THE ROYALTY ENDS,
AND THEN I HAVE 10% EQUITY
STAKE IN THE COMPANY.
DEAL.
OH, MY GOD!
OKAY.
WHOO-HOO!
WHOO-HOO!
THAT WAS A SWITCHEROO, BOY.
THAT WENT AROUND
QUITE A BIT, RIGHT?
OH, MY GOD.
CONGRATULATIONS, PETER.
THANK YOU. YEP.
WOW.
Thorpe: THIS DEAL MEANS
EVERYTHING TO MY FAMILY.
AND GIVING UP THAT MUCH
EQUITY IN THE BEGINNING
I STILL STAND BEHIND.
WITH LORI'S NETWORK
AND MARKETING ABILITIES
TO GET THIS OUT TO THE MASSES
AND BUILD AWARENESS
IS WHY I WANTED
TO WORK WITH HER.
