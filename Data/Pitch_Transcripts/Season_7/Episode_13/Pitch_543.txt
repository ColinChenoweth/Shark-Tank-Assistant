HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS TONY GAUTHIER.
I AM SCOTT HOAG.
AND I'M WESLEY OSAZE.
AND TOGETHER,
WE ARE THE OWNERS OF...
SPRETZ!
SPRETZ!
SPRETZ!
THE ONE SPRAY THAT IS...
TOO FRESH!
TOO FRESH!
TOO FRESH!
AND WE'RE SEEKING
A $100,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 20% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, IT ALL STARTED
WHEN I WAS HOSTING AN EVENT,
AND I SMELLED LIKE SMOKE.
NOW, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MINTS,
CANDIES, LOTIONS, COLOGNES,
NOTHING. ALL I HAD
WAS A PIECE OF GUM.
OKAY, TONE, GUM DOESN'T REMOVE
ODORS FROM YOUR HANDS.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T.
NOW, I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED
TO ADMIT THIS,
BUT I STARTED CHEWING
THAT PIECE OF GUM
AND THEN I SPIT IT IN MY HANDS
AND STARTED ROLLING IT --
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
THAT'S NASTY.
THAT'S NOT SEXY,
RIGHT, SHARKS?
MNH-MNH. MNH-MNH.
BUT THAT'S WHEN
THE LIGHT BULB WENT OFF.
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "NOW,
WHAT IF THERE WAS ONE PRODUCT
THAT COULD REMOVE
THE SMELL OF ODORS
FROM BOTH YOUR BREATH
AND YOUR HANDS?"
BOOM!
BOOM!
BOOM!
AND THAT'S WHEN SPRETZ
WAS CONCEIVED.
SPRETZ IS THE FIRST ALL-NATURAL,
TWO-IN-ONE SPRAY PRODUCT
THAT DELIVERS A POWERFUL MIST
OF FRESHNESS
TO BOTH YOUR BREATH
AND YOUR HANDS.
JUST HAD SOME GARLIC FRIES
AT THE GAME?
SPRETZ!
YOU GOT A HOT DATE?
YOU CAN'T SMELL LIKE STINK.
SPRETZ!
SPRETZ!
SPRETZ!
SO, ALL IT TAKES IS A COUPLE
SPRAYS OF SPRITS
TO RESTORE YOUR CONFIDENCE
AND SECURITY.
All:
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF FRESH.
SO NOW WE'RE GONNA PASS OUT
A FEW SAMPLES.
THE FLAGSHIP FLAVORS --
CINNA-MINT AND PEPPERMINT.
Cuban: WOW!
Herjavec: BOOM!
THAT WAS GREAT, GUYS.
NICE JOB.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY
HOURS YOU GUYS WORKED ON THAT.
Hoag: THANK YOU.
Gauthier: JUST ONE.
YOU CAN SPRAY IT IN YOUR MOUTH,
AND YOU CAN SPRAY IT
ON YOUR HANDS.
RUB IT AROUND GENEROUSLY.
OOH, STRONG.
AND IT'S A POWERFUL MINT,
ROBERT.
SO THAT'S WHY IT
SMELLS STRONG.
YEAH, THAT'S POWERFUL.
OH, HELLO.
Greiner: ONE SPRITZ?
Osaze: IT SHOULD
WAKE YOU RIGHT UP.
I LIKE IT.
YOU CAN SPRAY IT
ON YOUR HANDS.
I HAVE A QUESTION.
YEAH, SURE.
SO, THIS IS NOT
A HAND SANITIZER.
Hoag: NO, MA'AM.
IT'S NOT A HAND SANITIZER.
IT IS IF YOUR HANDS
ARE STINKY?
YES. EXACTLY.
IT'S MORE OF A CONVENIENT WAY
TO FRESHEN UP WHILE ON THE GO.
HOW WOULD I KNOW,
IN THAT PACKAGING,
THAT IT ALSO CAN BE USED
ON MY HANDS?
SO, WITH --
YOU THREE GUYS
AREN'T GONNA BE DOING
HIP-HOP ROUTINES
IN EVERY STORE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Osaze: SO, THIS IS THE FIRST
ITERATION OF THE PACKAGING.
THE SECOND ITERATION,
WE DO HAVE TO SHOW
THAT YOU CAN USE IT BOTH
ON YOUR BREATH AND HANDS.
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE
YOUR LABEL?
YEAH.
YOU PUT IT ON THERE?
SO, WAIT, WAIT.
ARE YOU GUYS SELLING --
ARE YOU GUYS SELLING THIS
ANYWHERE AT ALL?
SO, PRE-CONCEPT -- WE'VE BEEN,
LIKE, DOING OUR TEST MARKET.
WE'VE SOLD CLOSE TO
1,000 UNITS ALREADY.
THIS IS BEFORE --
AT WHAT PRICE, TONY?
AT $3.95.
LET'S JUST TAKE A SNAPSHOT
OF SALES SO FAR.
YOU'VE SOLD 1,000 UNITS?
MM-HMM.
YEAH.
SO, HOW MANY DOLLARS IS THAT?
$35,000-- $3,500.
$3,500?
YEAH.
IN JUST THE LAST 60 DAYS.
AND YOU'VE PUT IT --
PRE-LAUNCH,
WITHOUT ANY MARKETING
OR PROMOTION WHATSOEVER.
WHEN DID YOU START, THOUGH?
WHAT MONTH?
AND THAT WAS ON
YOUR WEBSITE, THEN?
-TWO MONTHS AGO.
-TWO MONTHS AGO.
ONLY TWO MONTHS AGO?
60 DAYS AGO. WE'VE ALREADY
SOLD CLOSE TO 1,000 UNITS
AND ALREADY HAVE
PURCHASE ORDERS
FROM SOME STORES
AND ALSO A MAJOR HOTEL.
HOW DID YOU SELL
THE FIRST 1,000 UNITS?
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
FACE-TO-FACE.
HAND-TO-HAND. FACE-TO-FACE.
WORD OF MOUTH.
HAND-TO-HAND.
COMING UP TO PEOPLE.
YOU WERE JUST
STANDING ON THE STREET?
I HAVE AN EXPERIMENT
FOR YOU.
CAN YOU PICK UP THE GARLIC
THAT'S ON THAT PLATE?
YEAH.
CAN YOU RUB IT AROUND
IN YOUR HAND?
THEN I WANT TO SMELL
YOUR HAND.
OKAY.
Hoag: SMELL TEST.
THEN I WANT TO SMELL IT
AFTER IT SPRITZ IT.
Osaze: [ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: WOW!
OKAY.
SMELLS GARLICKY. KEVIN?
O'Leary: YEAH.
A LITTLE. IT SMELLS A LITTLE.
NOT A LOT.
NOW HIT IT.
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU --
I'LL GIVE YOU --
HIT IT WITH THE...
OKAY.
PUT SOME CHEESE ON THERE
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT. COME ON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA
COME BACK IN A FEW MINUTES.
I WANT TO SMELL IT AGAIN.
OKAY.
O'Leary: I ALWAYS LIKE
TO BE AN OPTIMIST.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
MR. WONDERFUL.
LET'S ASSUME IT'S GREAT.
OKAY.
I'VE GIVEN YOU $100,000.
I SAY, "OKAY, GUYS,
LET'S GET SOME DISTRIBUTION."
RIGHT.
SO THIS THING HAS TO FIND ITS
WAY ONTO EVERY SHELF IN AMERICA.
HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?
ABSOLUTELY. YES.
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE
SEEKING YOUR HELP.
OH, RIGHT.
Cuban: BUT IT'S NOT JUST
GETTING ON THE SHELF
IS NOT ALWAYS
THE HARDEST PART.
RIGHT.
COMING OFF THE SHELF
INTO SOMEONE'S POCKET
AND TAKING THEIR $4
IS THE HARD PART.
RIGHT.
AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU GUYS
MY NATURAL INCLINATION WAS,
"WAIT, THAT -- THAT
DOESN'T WORK FOR ME," RIGHT?
IN MY MOUTH AND ON MY HANDS.
SO IT'S A DISCONNECT.
I DON'T IMMEDIATELY THINK,
"OH, YEAH, MY BREATH STINKS.
MY HANDS STINK.
LET'S SPRAY AWAY," YOU KNOW?
WE'VE SAW THAT
IN OUR TEST MARKET,
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MULTIPLE
ITEMS IN THEIR POCKET.
THEY HAVE THE GUM, THE LOTIONS,
THE SANITIZERS.
YOU'RE REDUCING THE NEED
TO BUY MULTIPLE ITEMS.
BUT YOU -- OKAY,
I GET THAT, RIGHT?
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO
EDUCATE PEOPLE.
SO THAT'S THE HARD PART.
THAT'S THE PART
I'M SCARED ABOUT.
NOW YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO
SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
OR AT LEAST $1 MILLION
TO MARKET IT.
$100,000
IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO DO
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
I WISH YOU GUYS THE BEST.
I DON'T SEE IT WORKING.
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
THAT RETAIL SPACE THAT
YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT --
THAT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE
PER LINEAR FOOT
IN THE ENTIRE STORE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S A NEW PRODUCT.
IT'S NEVER REALLY
BEEN DONE BEFORE.
WELL, IT'S ALSO A NEW CATEGORY.
IT'S A NEW CATEGORY.
RIGHT.
BUT OUR DRIVE,
OUR MOTIVATION,
OUR REASONS WHY --
YOU KNOW,
I LOST MY MOTHER EXACTLY
THREE YEARS AGO TO THIS DAY.
SORRY.
TO THIS DAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS A NEW PRODUCT,
BUT ALL OF YOU GUYS
ARE UP HERE FOR A REASON --
'CAUSE YOU TOOK A CHANCE.
YOU TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY.
YOU TOOK A RISK.
[ Voice breaking ]
I OWE IT TO MY MOTHER,
I OWE IT TO THESE GUYS, AND I
OWE IT TO MY FAMILY AND MYSELF.
WE GOT TO DO IT,
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.
BUT YOU GUYS DO.
TONY, IT'S GREAT PASSION,
BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH
THE ECONOMIC REALITY.
THAT'S TRUE.
IT'S --
$100,000'S NOT ENOUGH.
YOU KNOW, I GO HOME.
I VISIT MY MONEY.
"DADDY'S HOME!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN I SAY, "GUYS,
I'M GONNA SEND A MILLION OF YOU
OUT TO SPRETZ."
"DADDY, PLEASE, NO!
NO, DADDY!
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SPRETZ!
IT'S TOO RISKY!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT. I REALLY AM.
I'M OUT. I'M OUT.
I'M OUT.
SO WE HAVE NOTICED -- ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
I SEE YOUR POINT.
I JUST -- NO WAY.
OKAY.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE
$1 MILLION TO DRIVE THIS BRAND.
I THINK IF YOU SPEND $250,000,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT,
IF YOU SPEND
YOUR MONEY WISELY.
RIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY.
O'Leary: THAT'S VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU, BARBARA.
ARE YOU GONNA GIVE THEM
$250,000?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT YET.
OH.
RIGHT?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I DO AGREE WITH YOU, TONY,
ABOUT YOUR CONVICTION.
WE ALL FELT IT HERE.
AND I AGREE WITH
ALL OF YOUR HUSTLE.
YOUR ROUTINE IS POWERFUL.
I THINK YOU'RE WASTING IT
ON THIS TINY, LITTLE PRODUCT.
ON THIS PRODUCT
YOU'RE PITCHING, I AM OUT.
WAIT, WAIT,
BEFORE YOU SAY THAT --
OHH!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
LOOK, I LOVE THE HUSTLE,
BUT HUSTLE IS JUST
PAR FOR THE COURSE.
YOU CAN'T BUILD A BUSINESS
UNLESS YOU GOT THE HUSTLE.
ABSOLUTELY.
NOT GONNA WORK.
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS
THE RIGHT VEHICLE.
OKAY.
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT,
BUT I'M NOT SEEING THIS.
I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
BUT LORI'S STILL LEFT.
TONY, COME HERE.
LET ME SMELL YOUR HAND AGAIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND SHE'S SMELLING YOU.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
HEY, THE GARLIC IS GONE.
IT WORKS!
COME ON, LORI.
LISTEN, GUYS, I WOULD INVEST
IN <i>YOU.</i> YOU'RE AMAZING.
THE PROBLEM IS DO PEOPLE
REALLY HAVE A NEED
TO FRESHEN THEIR BREATH
AND THEIR HANDS?
I DON'T THINK THAT SMELLY HANDS
IS A HUGE PROBLEM
BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
JUST WASH THEIR HANDS
OR THEY USE HAND SANITIZER.
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT
FOR ME.
I'M OUT. IT DOES WORK.
BUT I THINK THAT,
GET OUT THERE, GRIND.
THERE ARE MORE GREAT IDEAS
TO COME.
OKAY.
THANKS, YOU GUYS, SO MUCH.
THANKS, GUYS.
ALL SHARKS ARE OUT.
Osaze: THANK YOU.
Cuban: GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT.
Osaze:
NOT GETTING A DEAL TODAY
JUST MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
Gauthier: YEAH. BUT DEFINITELY
APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK.
AND THEY SAID IT WORKS.
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
THEY SAID IT WORKS.
