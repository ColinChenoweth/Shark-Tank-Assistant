HI, I'M ALANNA.
AND I'M MAUREEN.
AND WE ARE HAIR STYLISTS
AND CURLY-HAIR EXPERTS
FROM PORTLAND, MAINE.
WE ARE CONTROLLED CHAOS.
WE'RE SEEKING $50,000
FOR 20% OF THE COMPANY.
EVERYONE'S HEARD OF
A BAD HAIR DAY, RIGHT?
NEVER HAPPENS TO ME.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
BUT YOU'VE HEARD OF IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
HOW ABOUT
A BAD HAIR LIFE?
-WOW.
-WHOA.
SCHOOL ASSEMBLY DAYS
AND MOVIE DAYS
WERE THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES
FOR MAUREEN AND I
GROWING UP AS KIDS.
YEAH, WE WOULD ACTUALLY
HEAR MEAN THINGS, LIKE,
"HOW YOU GONNA GET THROUGH
THE DOOR WITH THAT?"
"HEY, BRILLO PAD, MOVE THAT
FUZZ BALL YOU CALL A HEAD!"
"HEY, TEACHER, I CAN'T
SEE THE TV THROUGH HER."
[ EXAGGERATED LAUGHTER ]
[ Unenthused ]
[ Unenthused ]
HILARIOUS.
HILARIOUS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE ACTUALLY BECAME HAIR STYLISTS
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
WITH THIS SO-CALLED
"PROBLEM" BAD HAIR
LEARN TO EMBRACE AND LOVE
THEIR NATURAL TEXTURE.
FIRST, YOU NEED A PRODUCT
THAT WORKS WITH YOUR CURL.
SOME SO-CALLED CURLY PRODUCTS
WILL ACTUALLY
HOLD THE CURL TOGETHER,
BUT IT ALWAYS RESULTS
IN A STICKY, CRUSTY,
CRUNCHY FEELING.
BUT NOW,
WITH CURL UP &amp; SHINE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.
I CAN GO OUT IN
ANY TYPE OF WEATHER.
SO WE NO LONGER HAVE TO
FEAR HUMIDITY, THE RAIN.
WE CAN EVEN GO TO THE BEACH.
AND WE JUST WANT TO SHOW
THE WORLD HOW GREAT
PEOPLE CAN FEEL ABOUT THEMSELVES
WHEN THEY REALIZE...
Both: ...THE CURLS
ARE NOT A CURSE.
LITTLE EXAMPLE FOR YOU GUYS
TO SEE WHICH SIDE OF THIS HEAD
YOU'D RATHER RUN
YOUR FINGERS THROUGH.
RUN YOUR HANDS THROUGH,
AND YOU CAN JUST...
WHICH SIDE, MARK?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.
NO, YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
IT'S OBVIOUS.
WHAT A DIFFERENCE.
RIGHT?
IT ALSO LOOKS VASTLY DIFFERENT,
DOESN'T IT?
THANK YOU.
YEAH.
OKAY, SO THERE'S DEFINITELY
A PLASTIC-Y FEEL
VERSUS FLUFFY.
VERY SOFT AND NATURAL.
WITH MEMORY. WITH MEMORY.
NOTHING.
SO ONE HAS, LIKE,
THE TYPICAL GEL ON IT,
AND ONE IS YOUR GEL?
FEEL IT, LORI.
Emerson: YES. CORRECT.
GOTCHA.
OURS IS A CREAM.
IT DOESN'T LEAVE
A RESIDUE.
YEAH.
IT SMELLS NICE.
SO, HOW MUCH DO YOU
HAVE IN SALES?
ALMOST $300,000.
OKAY,
WHERE DO YOU SELL THOSE?
HAIR SALONS.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
10 PRODUCTS.
OKAY.
THIS IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT WE'RE MARKETING
BECAUSE WE WENT TOO BIG.
I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN
GO BIG OR GO HOME.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD
GO BIG AND GO HOME.
SO WE HAVE A BUNCH
OF INVENTORY.
YOU KNOW, I WENT, LIKE,
TOO CRAZY
BECAUSE WE HAD
A DISTRIBUTION DEAL.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HINDSIGHT'S 20/20.
IF I DIDN'T HAVE THIS DEAL
WITH THE DISTRIBUTOR
THAT REQUIRED THAT DEVELOP
A FULL LINE OF PRODUCT...
OY.
...I WOULD HAVE DONE
JUST A CURL CREAM,
SPENT $20,000 MARKETING
THE BEST CURL CREAM EVER SEEN
ON THE PLANET,
AND THEN GROW FROM THERE.
AND, ALANNA,
WHY IS THIS BAD NEWS?
DIDN'T THEY BUY
ALL THOSE PRODUCTS?
NO.
Corcoran: THEY PROMISED.
BECAUSE THIS WAS IN 2007.
SO HE NO LONGER OWNS
THE DISTRIBUTORSHIP.
MM.
AND IT'S -- YEAH.
WHAT DID YOU SELL LAST YEAR?
$85,000.
OUT OF THE $85,000,
HOW MUCH OF IT WAS THIS PRODUCT?
PROBABLY $30,000 WAS
THE CURL CREAM ALONE.
ARE YOU GROWING,
OR ARE YOU SLOWING?
OH, GROWING.
DEFINITELY.
WHICH IS IT?
GROWING.
WELL, TELL ME WHAT
THE NUMBERS ARE.
$30,000 THIS PAST YEAR
ON JUST THIS PRODUCT?
YEP.
AND HOW ABOUT
THE PRIOR YEARS?
IT'S ACTUALLY PROBABLY
BEEN ABOUT THE SAME
BECAUSE OUR SALES FOR
THE PAST TWO YEARS
HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE SAME.
WELL, THAT WOULD NOT BE GROWING.
THAT WOULD BE FLAT.
WELL...THIS...
THANK GOODNESS I'M HERE.
WE'RE [LAUGHS]
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
STOPPED ADVERTISING,
STOPPED SELLING ALTOGETHER
BECAUSE WE ARE --
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN
FOR A BUSINESS.
I KNOW, BUT I KNOW I CAN'T
AFFORD ANY MORE INVENTORY.
I MEAN, I HAVE A REALLY
GREAT MIND FOR BUSINESS.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
I BOUGHT MY FIRST HOUSE
AT 21.
I FIXED AND FLIPPED IT,
MADE MONEY KIND OF BY MISTAKE.
LIKE, I BELIEVE IN DOING
AWESOME THINGS
AND HAVING MONEY BE A BYPRODUCT
OF YOUR AWESOMENESS.
AND THEN I OPENED
MY OWN SALON
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE THE DECOR
OF WHERE I WORKED.
I DIDN'T EVEN REALLY
WANT TO OWN A SALON.
NOW I OWN
A 5,000-SQUARE-FOOT SALON.
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
THAT IS NOT AWESOMENESS
OF BUSINESS, RIGHT?
THAT'S CALLED
STUMBLING INTO THINGS.
BUT THIS BUSINESS --
YEAH.
THIS BUSINESS
I WAS COMPLETELY NAIVE,
WHICH I HATE TO ADMIT.
WE WERE SO UNDER-FUNDED.
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS
GETTING MYSELF INTO.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
DID YOU PUT IN?
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S A VERY HARD --
IT'S A VERY HARD BUSINESS.
O'Leary: BUT HANG ON. HANG ON.
LET'S STOP FOR A MOMENT.
LET'S STOP FOR A MOMENT AND ASK
OURSELVES HOW'S IT GOING?
YOU'RE IN THE SHARK TANK.
HORRIBLY!
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M TALKING --
THAT'S EXCITING TO HEAR.
WAIT, WAIT, HOW MUCH
MONEY HAVE YOU PUT IN?
I HAVE OVER $300,000 IN IT.
OHH!
WHAT?!
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER BUSINESS.
I HAVE A HAIR SALON.
ALANNA, WHO'S MAUREEN?
MAUREEN IS OUR EDUCATOR.
I'M AN EDUCATOR
AND STYLIST.
SHE TEACHES --
DOES SHE OWN THE BUSINESS?
NO, SHE CREATED THE PRODUCTS
WITH ME FROM DAY ONE.
MAUREEN, HOW DO YOU THINK
ALANNA'S PRESENTATION'S GOING
HERE IN THE SHARK TANK?
I THINK, UH, THAT THERE'S
A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO SHE'S A POLITICIAN.
Greiner: ALANNA,
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
Cuban:
OH, MY GOODNESS.
SO, YOU'RE A HAIR DRESSER.
YOU'VE OPENED UP SALONS.
AND THAT SALON DOES
$1 MILLION A YEAR
IN A POPULATION
WITH 60,000 PEOPLE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
SO I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
THANKS.
YOU DECIDE TO YOURSELF,
"I'D LIKE TO HAVE A LINE."
LIKE, ALMOST EVERY HAIR DRESSER
I'VE EVER KNOWN
WANTS THEIR OWN LINE, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
BUT YOU HAVE A SECRET SAUCE HERE
YOU THINK IS BETTER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S.
I <i>KNOW</i> IS.
WHY IS YOURS BETTER?
FOR ONE, IT WORKS.
NOTHING ELSE REALLY WORKS.
OKAY. WHY WOULD YOU NOT
JUST TAKE THIS
AND JUST TRY TO PUSH
THAT ONE THING, LIKE,
INTO SALLY BEAUTY
AND INTO THE DIFFERENT WAYS
IN WHICH YOU CAN DISTRIBUTE IT?
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
BY ONE OF THE LARGEST
INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS
IN THE COUNTRY THAT THEY WOULD
GIVE US A PURCHASE ORDER
BEGINNING WITH
500 UNITS A MONTH OF THAT
IF WE CHANGE OUR PACKAGING.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
YEAH, YOUR PACKAGING
NEEDS A CHANGE.
I'M OUT OF MONEY.
MY OTHER BUSINESS
IS SUFFERING.
HOW MUCH LONGER?
I MEAN, AT SOME POINT --
DO YOU SELL THIS ONLINE?
AND IF SO, WHAT DO YOU CHARGE
FOR WHAT I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND?
8 OUNCE FOR $39.
$39. IS THAT A LOT FOR
THAT KIND OF PRODUCT?
WOW!
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I ACTUALLY
HAVE VERY CURLY HAIR.
I JUST KEEP IT VERY SHORT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD IDEA.
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
MY HAIR WAS DOWN TO
MY SHOULDERS AND WAS CURLY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH $50,000?
I WOULD LIKE TO RE-BRAND,
RE-PACKAGE, AND --
WHAT WOULD THAT COST?
I'M SURE YOU'VE --
WELL, I HOPE YOU'VE
PRICED THAT OUT.
$50,000.
YOU GET $50,000,
BUT NOW YOU HAVE NO MONEY LEFT
FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.
WELL, I'M THINKING IF
I HAD $50,000,
THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD COST ME
TO RE-BRAND AND REFILL
AND GO TO THE DISTRIBUTOR
AND DO THE PURCHASE ORDER
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE.
RIGHT.
I'M GUESSING THAT $50,000
TO YOU GUYS
IS WORTH A LOT MORE
THAN $50,000, SO...
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WITH YOUR CONNECTIONS
THAT YOU HAVE.
I BELIEVE IN IT SO MUCH,
SO --
I DON'T INVEST IN "BELIEVE."
I INVEST IN "DO."
I'M OUT.
GOTCHA. THANK YOU.
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN
A VERY INTERESTING JOURNEY
LISTENING TO YOU
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU HAVE A PRODUCT
THAT DOES ONE THING VERY WELL.
I BELIEVE THAT.
BUT YOUR STORY IS ONE
OF CHAOS AND CONFUSION.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I THINK YOU CALLED
YOUR BUSINESS THAT.
[ LAUGHS ]
CONTROLLED CHAOS.
NO, THE NAME IS NOT
CONTROLLED CHAOS.
IT'S JUST CHAOS.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT HAIR,
I CAN TALK ABOUT HAIR.
[ LAUGHS ]
50% OF THE WOMEN HAVE
CURLY HAIR, RIGHT?
60%.
60%.
-ISN'T THAT THE STAT IN AMERICA?
-60%?
-THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. I BELIEVE.
-60%?
SO HERE'S THE DEAL
I'M WILLING TO OFFER YOU.
OH, THERE'S AN OFFER?
MAUREEN AND ALANNA
HAVE NOT IMPRESSED THE SHARKS
WITH THEIR BUSINESS ACUMEN.
BUT KEVIN KNOWS
THERE'S A HUGE MARKET
FOR THEIR HAIR CREAM FOR
CURLY HAIR -- CONTROLLED CHAOS.
50% OF THE WOMEN HAVE
CURLY HAIR, RIGHT? ISN'T
THAT THE STAT IN AMERICA?
60%.
60%.
60%?
THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.
60%?
I BELIEVE.
SO HERE'S THE DEAL
I'M WILLING TO OFFER YOU.
OH, THERE'S AN OFFER?
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $50,000.
I WANT 50%, ALL RIGHT?
AND I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.
I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH
ALL THE REST OF THOSE PRODUCTS.
IT'S A GREAT OFFER.
IT'S JUST THIS PRODUCT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Cuban: HMM.
YOU BETTER SAY YES BEFORE
SOMEBODY CHANGES THEIR MIND.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS
AT AUCTIONS?
WELL, THERE ARE TWO GIRLS,
TOO, RIGHT?
$51,000.
YOU'RE GIVING HER $1,000?
$51,000. 50%.
SHE'S STARTING AN AUCTION.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
I GOT THE BIDDING GOING
BECAUSE I KNOW HAIR.
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT
THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT OUT
FOR WOMEN WITH CURLY HAIR?
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK I TRUST YOUR GUT
CREATIVELY 150%.
YEAH.
BUT I DON'T TRUST YOU
FOR A SECOND
ON KNOWING HOW TO REIN THINGS IN
AND MAKE IT GET DIRECTED
EXACTLY AT THE TARGET
THAT YOU NEED TO HIT.
RIGHT.
I WANT 51% OF YOUR BUSINESS.
[ WHIMPERS ]
FOR $50,000,
I WANT THE MAJORITY SHARE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.
BUT I DON'T WANT 51% OF
THE REVENUE OR THE DIVIDENDS.
I'LL TAKE 1/3.
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU GET TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
BECAUSE I'M GREAT AT BUILDING
A BUSINESS.
INTERESTING OFFER.
YOU'RE THE CREATIVE GENIUS HERE,
BUT IF YOU'RE A SMART WOMAN,
YOU WOULD HAND ME THE CONTROL
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO
BUILD BUSINESSES.
AND I'M NOT TAKING MORE THAN
MY FAIR SHARE OF THE PROFITS,
WHICH WE WILL HAVE.
I'M ONLY TAKING 1/3
OF THE PROFITS.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT OFFER?
AND WHAT'S...
ALL RIGHT, I'M BACK.
York: YES.
THIS -- THIS I HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LORI'S GONNA ADJUST HER OFFER.
ALTHOUGH I WANTED TO
SAY YES.
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, THEN, SAY YES!
[ LAUGHTER ]
$60,000. 50%.
I KNOW HOW TO MOVE PRODUCT,
LIKE, LIGHTNING SPEED.
I THINK I CAN MOVE
A LOT OF UNITS.
WE GOT TO REPACKAGE.
BUT I CAN GET IT OUT THERE
ON QVC
FOR THAT 60% OF WOMEN
WITH CURLY HAIR.
BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE
MY OFFER NOW BECAUSE IT'S,
LIKE, GOING, GOING, GOING.
O'Leary:
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FALL
FOR THAT TRICK.
ROBERT HASN'T SAID
IF HE'S IN OR OUT.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE WORRIED.
YOU'RE IN CHARGE HERE.
IF YOU KNOW IF I'M RIGHT
FOR YOU...
TWO OFFERS ON THE TABLE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY
SHARKS ARE --
ALANNA, LET ME JUST
CLEAR THE FIELD.
YOU'VE GOT THREE GOOD OFFERS
HERE, AMAZING TO ME.
[ LAUGHS ]
I DO.
I LOVE YOUR HONESTY.
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE -- YOU'VE
GOT THREE GREAT OFFERS.
I'M OUT.
BUT LORI IS MAKING YOU AN OFFER
WITH A DEADLINE.
Greiner:
I LIKE THE PRODUCT,
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU
CAN BE A GREAT PARTNER.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
I HAVE BEEN ON QVC FOR
TWO YEARS IN MY HEAD, SO...
OH!
Herjavec:
SO WHAT?! WHAT?!
LET'S DO IT!
LET'S DO IT, LORI!
ARE YOU TAKING HER OFFER,
OR...?
[ LAUGHS ] YES.
OHH, WHAT A MISTAKE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU DODGED A BULLET.
I DIDN'T.
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
Greiner: I LIKE IT.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
WE'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
I DON'T LOVE YOU BACK
RIGHT NOW.
WE'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
ALANNA, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
Cuban: THANKS, GUYS.
Greiner: THANK YOU.
BYE.
Corcoran: BYE-BYE.
THANK YOU.
WHO SAW THAT COMING?
ONLY ON "SHARK TANK"
DO WE GET A BIDDING WAR
OVER A DYING BUSINESS.
THAT'S GONNA SELL.
IT'S GOING TO SELL.
THAT'S NOT GONNA SELL.
I KNOW HAIR.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT'S...
JUST NOT
ON YOUR HEAD, KEVIN.
GAH!
[ Singsong voice ]
AMAZING.
[ LAUGHS ]
