MY NAME IS EVAN LUTZ.
I'M 23 YEARS OLD.
AND I LIVE IN
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND.
MY ENTIRE LIFE, I'VE WANTED
TO BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR,
AND GROWING UP IN BALTIMORE,
I SAW WAY TOO MUCH POVERTY
AND HUNGER.
AND I KNEW I WANTED TO START
A BUSINESS THAT MADE
A POSITIVE IMPACT
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.
SO, WHAT KINDS OF PRODUCE
DO YOU GROW HERE?
I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I FOUND OUT
HOW MUCH FOOD GETS WASTED
IN THIS COUNTRY.
OVER 6 BILLION POUNDS OF PRODUCE
GETS THROWN AWAY
EVERY SINGLE YEAR.
A LARGE PORTION OF THAT WASTE
COMES FROM SPOILAGE ON FARMS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S TOUGH FOR FARMERS TO SELL
EVERY SINGLE PIECE
OF PRODUCE THEY GROW.
ALL THAT FOOD WASTE ENDS UP
IN LANDFILLS,
WHERE IT EMITS METHANE GAS,
WHICH IS A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR
TO GLOBAL WARMING.
HERE'S ONE.
I'VE MADE IT MY MISSION
TO HELP SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS
AND REDEFINE WASTE.
MY COMPANY PROVIDES THE MOST
AFFORDABLE AND CONVENIENT WAY
FOR CONSUMERS TO EAT HEALTHY AND
GIVE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITY.
AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE EATING IT UP.
WE GOT GOOD STUFF.
I'VE POURED MY HEART, MY SOUL,
MY ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
WITHOUT AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS,
OUR COMPANY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO OFFER THE SOLUTION
THAT THIS COUNTRY
SO DESPERATELY NEEDS.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S EVAN LUTZ.
I'M FROM BALTIMORE, MARYLAND.
I'M THE C.E.O. AND CO-FOUNDER
OF HUNGRY HARVEST.
AND I'M SEEKING $50,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 5% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN
THE GROCERY-STORE AISLE,
AND YOU SEE ALL THE APPLES
LINED UP ALL SHINY,
PERFECT, SAME SIZE, SAME COLOR,
SAME SHAPE, YOU MIGHT WONDER,
"HOW ON EARTH DO THEY GROW
THE SAME EXACT WAY?"
WELL, THE FACT IS THEY DIDN'T.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FRUITS
AND VEGETABLES THAT DON'T MEET
THAT SUPERFICIAL CRITERIA
OFTENTIMES WIND UP
IN A LANDFILL.
6 BILLION POUNDS OF PRODUCE
GET THROWN AWAY
EVERY SINGLE YEAR
IN THE UNITED STATES.
50 MILLION AMERICANS,
ONE-SIXTH OF OUR COUNTRY
DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM.
AT HUNGRY HARVEST, WE USE
ONE PROBLEM TO SOLVE THE OTHER.
WE PURCHASE SURPLUS PRODUCE
FROM LOCAL FARMS AND WHOLESALERS
THAT NORMALLY GET THROWN AWAY,
NOT BECAUSE IT'S BAD OR ROTTEN,
BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S UGLY.
FOR EXAMPLE, THESE BANANAS
AND THESE SWEET POTATOES --
WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE.
WE ASSEMBLE IT INTO VARIETY BAGS
AND DELIVER IT TO
OUR CUSTOMERS' DOORS
FOR A WEEKLY SUBSCRIPTION MODEL.
FOR EVERY BAG WE DELIVER
TO ONE OF OUR CUSTOMERS,
WE DONATE A HEALTHY MEAL
TO SOMEONE IN NEED.
WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS RECEIVE
THEIR DELIVERIES ON SUNDAYS,
THEY FEEL EXCITED 'CAUSE
NOT ONLY ARE THEY SAVING TIME,
SAVING MONEY,
AND EATING HEALTHY,
BUT THEY'RE HELPING REDUCE FOOD
WASTE, FEED HUNGRY FAMILIES,
SUPPORT LOCAL FARMERS,
AND CREATE JOBS FOR THOSE
GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET.
HELP US FIGHT FOOD WASTE
AND HUNGER IN AMERICA.
WE'RE HUNGRY HARVEST.
WE SELL PRODUCE WITH PURPOSE.
SHARKS, WHO'S HUNGRY?
OF COURSE, I HAVE SOME SAMPLES,
SO I'LL PASS OUT SOME.
HERE YOU GO.
AND THIS IS OUR FULL SHARE.
SO THIS IS OUR $25 OPTION.
THANK YOU.
THESE LOOK LIKE THE ONES
I TRIED TO GROW.
IF YOU'RE A CUSTOMER...
YEAH.
...WHAT DO YOU PAY,
AND HOW DOES
THE SERVICE WORK?
WE HAVE THREE SIZE OPTIONS.
THE MINI IS $15 PER WEEK.
THAT'S ALL-INCLUSIVE CHARGE.
THE FULL IS $25.
AND THE SUPER IS $35.
SO EACH BAG INCLUDES
ONE TO TWO LEAFY GREENS,
THREE TO FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF VEGETABLES,
TWO TO FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF
FRUIT, AND AN HERB OR FLAVORING.
O'Leary: IT'S JUST AS FRESH,
EXCEPT IT'S REJECTED
BECAUSE OF ITS VISUAL...
VISUAL. SO IT GOES TO WASTE
FOR TWO MAIN REASONS --
ONE, FOR COSMETIC
IMPERFECTIONS...
YEAH.
...AND, TWO, FOR LOGISTICAL
INEFFICIENCIES.
IT'S VERY TOUGH FOR FARMERS
TO GROW THE EXACT AMOUNT
OF PRODUCE THAT THEY'RE
CONTRACTED TO GROW.
ARE YOU BUYING IT DIRECTLY
FROM THE FARMER, THEN?
SO, WE HAVE A NETWORK
OF SUPPLIERS,
WHICH INCLUDES BOTH FARM
AND WHOLESALERS.
THE COOL PART ABOUT IT IS
WE KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH PRODUCE TO ORDER
EACH WEEK.
WE HAVE NO INVENTORY RISK.
'CAUSE YOU ONLY ORDER BASED ON
SUBSCRIPTIONS YOU HAVE.
EXACTLY.
MM!
SO TELL US ABOUT
THE ACTUAL BUSINESS.
IN OUR FIRST SIX MONTHS
OF BUSINESS,
WE DID $37,000 IN SALES.
IN OUR LAST SIX MONTHS,
WE'VE DONE $104,000 IN SALES.
GOOD FOR YOU.
SO, THANK YOU.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY
NOT PROFITABLE.
WE'VE HAD A NET LOSS
OF ABOUT $20,000.
ARE YOU PAYING YOURSELF
ANYTHING?
I'M NOT PAYING MYSELF QUITE YET.
EVAN, CAN YOU EQUATE
THOSE REVENUE NUMBERS
TO THE AMOUNT
OF CUSTOMERS?
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE JUST OVER
500 ACTIVE CUSTOMERS.
AND THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
WE HAVE A REALLY UNIQUE
VALUE PROPOSITION.
THIS IS SAVING THEM TIME FROM
NOT GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE.
THIS IS SAVING THEM MONEY.
AND WE ALLOW THEM TO GIVE BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY SEAMLESSLY
JUST BY SIGNING UP.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN
MORE ABOUT THAT?
HOW? HOW DO
THEY DO THAT?
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
WE UNDERSTAND
THE CHARITABLE COMPONENT OF IT.
Cuban: BECAUSE FOOD'S
NOT BEING WASTED.
RIGHT, SO, ON OUR BACK END,
WE'RE HELPING REDUCE FOOD WASTE
'CAUSE ALL THIS WOULD
NORMALLY GO TO WASTE.
WE'RE FEEDING HUNGRY FAMILIES
'CAUSE WE DONATE
1.2 POUNDS OF PRODUCE
FOR EVERY BAG WE DELIVER.
YOU DO? OKAY.
WE ALSO HOST
FREE FARMERS MARKETS,
WHERE WE'LL SET UP SHOP
IN AN IMPOVERISHED NEIGHBORHOOD,
BUY 5,000 POUNDS OF PRODUCE,
GIVE IT ALL AWAY.
EVAN, WHY BOTHER DOING THAT
WHILE YOU'RE UNPROFITABLE?
THAT'S HIS MARKETING
EXPENSE.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU --
EXACTLY.
IT'S A MARKETING EXPENSE.
IT'S SOCIAL VALUE.
IF YOU'RE NOT PROFITABLE,
YOU'RE NOT SUSTAINABLE.
IF YOU'RE NOT GROWING,
YOU'RE DYING.
EVAN, LOOK.
I'D LIKE TO GET TO 10%.
LET ME FINISH MY OFFER.
EVAN,
I MADE YOU A FAIR OFFER.
SO SAY IT ALREADY.
IF YOU THINK THERE'S
A BETTER OFFER COMING,
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
DISRESPECTFUL TO YOU...
YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT YET.
...BUT THERE'S NO POINT.
I MEAN, THIS IS SOMETHING
I WANT TO DO.
AND SO...
SO I'LL GIVE YOU --
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE
WITH KEVIN ON IT.
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
MY OFFER OR NOT?
I MEAN...
Greiner: EVAN, EVAN.
...EITHER TAKE
MY OFFER
OR ARGUE WITH KEVIN
AND MARK AND LORI.
ROBERT.
SPEAK UP, YOUNG MAN.
I'D LOVE TO ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.
WHOA!
THANK YOU.
YAY!
Cuban: SMART.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I DIDN'T WANT TO FORCE YOU
INTO IT,
BUT I THINK IT'S SUCH
A GREAT IDEA.
THANK YOU.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
YOU WERE HONEST.
YOU WERE AWESOME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I LOVE IT.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
YEAH.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT
OF MONEY, OKAY?
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. TAKE CARE, EVERYBODY.
NICE MEETING YOU, EVERYBODY.
Cuban: CONGRATULATIONS, EVAN.
GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK.
GREAT MISSION.
Lutz: TO MAKE A DEAL WITH ROBERT
FOR MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE ASKING,
IT'S JUST --
DREAMS DO COME TRUE.
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY...
I'M -- I'M SPEECHLESS.
I REALLY AM.
I'M SPEECHLESS.
