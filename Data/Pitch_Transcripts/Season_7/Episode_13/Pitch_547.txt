HI, MY NAME'S LINDSEY LAURAIN,
AND I'M FROM PARKER, COLORADO.
I AM THE FOUNDER OF EZPZ,
AND TODAY,
I AM SEEKING $1 MILLION
FOR A 5% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
WOW!
DANG!
HEAR ME OUT. HEAR ME OUT.
WHEW!
HEAR ME OUT.
THANKS FOR COMING.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHARKS, WHO HAS RECENTLY
HAD OR WITNESSED
MEAL TIME WITH A TODDLER?
IN OUR CASE, THREE TODDLERS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT MEAL TIME
USED TO LOOK LIKE AT OUR HOUSE.
UGH.
YOUR KIDS ARE SLOBS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HONESTLY, THAT WAS WHAT MEALTIME
USED TO LOOK LIKE AT OUR HOUSE.
IT WAS CRAZY.
MY HUSBAND AND I KNEW
THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY,
SO WE CREATED IT.
THE HAPPY MAT IS AN ALL-IN-ONE
SILICONE PLACE MAT AND PLATE.
BUT THE BEST PART IS THE MAT
SUCTIONS TO THE SURFACE.
SO THIS MEANS
NO MORE TIPPED BOWLS OR PLATES
DURING MEAL TIME.
CLEVER.
CLEVER.
THE HAPPY MAT NAME
REALLY SAYS IT ALL.
THE SMILEY-FACE DESIGN CREATES
A POSITIVE FEEDING EXPERIENCE.
THERE IS TRULY NOTHING LIKE
EZPZ ON THE MARKET.
WE ARE REVOLUTIONIZING
THE FEEDING INDUSTRY
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT
MEALTIME LOOKS LIKE NOW.
ARE THESE THE SAME KIDS?
[ LAUGHTER ]
Greiner:
THEY'RE BEING VERY GOOD.
YOU SEDATED THEM.
OH, COME ON.
YOU PAID THEM TO SAY THAT.
[ LAUGHS ]
LINDSEY, WE GOT TO GO
RIGHT TO THE SALES BECAUSE --
GOT TO GO RIGHT
TO THE NUMBERS.
NO, SAMPLES!
GONNA HAVE
A GOOD STORY THERE.
NO, COME ON. COME ON!
SAMPLES!
$20 MILLION!
SAMPLES.
Laurain: OKAY.
Herjavec: IS THERE FOOD
IN THE SAMPLES?
YES, AS I SAID...
THE BOTTOM ONE IS LORI'S?
YEP. GRAY IS LORI.
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO, LORI.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU.
AND AS I SAID,
YOU CAN STACK AND SERVE
EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME,
SO...
IT'S SO CUTE.
OH, IT'S VERY CUTE.
AND
THE SMILEY-FACE DESIGN...
HOW NICE IS THAT?
...REALLY DOES CREATE
A POSITIVE FEEDING EXPERIENCE.
BLUE --
YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.
WHAT'S THE LITTLE EYEBALL
ON THERE?
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Corcoran: I'M JUST CURIOUS
WHAT YOU SELL ONE MAT FOR.
YES, SO, ONE MAT RETAILS
FOR $24.99.
OUR WHOLESALE PRICE IS $12.50,
AND THEN WE HAVE
A 50% MARGIN WITH THAT.
SO YOU MAKE IT FOR
ABOUT 6 BUCKS?
YES, A LITTLE BIT --
AROUND THAT.
SO, LINDSEY, YOU'VE IMPUTED
A VALUE -- $1 MILLION, 5%.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS
BUSINESS IS WORTH $20 MILLION.
LET'S GO TO THE NUMBERS NOW!
Laurain: YES.
SO, WHAT -- I THINK THAT'S THE
ONLY THING WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT.
OKAY.
BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH
A CRAZY ASK,
UNLESS YOU HAVE
PHENOMENAL SALES.
OKAY, SO, YES, OUR SALES
ARE VERY STRONG, AND --
TELL US WHAT THEY ARE.
I'LL BE HONEST --
I WANTED TO DO FIVE TIMES
THAT VALUATION.
FIVE TIMES?
OUT WITH IT.
WHAT -- IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SELL?
SO, WE'VE DONE 85,000 UNITS
THIS YEAR
AT $1.2 MILLION GROSS SALES.
THAT'S IT?
-YEP.
-[ LAUGHS ]
SO I'M GONNA PAY
16 TIMES SALES
FOR A RUBBER MAT
WITH A FACE ON IT?
ARE YOU EXPECTING, LIKE,
TO DO $30 MILLION
THIS YEAR OR SOMETHING?
WAY MORE THAN $30 MILLION.
SO, LIKE, LAST WEEK,
WE WERE IN GERMANY AT
THE WORLD'S LARGEST BABY SHOW.
WE MET WITH 400 INTERNATIONAL
DISTRIBUTORS.
WE WERE THE HIT OF THE SHOW.
SO WE'VE GOTTEN 400 CONTACTS,
EVERY COUNTRY, AUSTRALIA.
I'M ASSUMING
YOU HAVE A PATENT.
DO YOU TAKE ORDERS
AT A SHOW LIKE THAT?
DO YOU TAKE ORDERS?
YEAH, SO, WE SOLD --
NOT ON THE SPOT.
I MEAN, AUSTRALIA HAS SAID
THEY'LL TAKE A CONTAINER.
THEY WOULD DO A 40-FOOT
CONTAINER EVERY MONTH.
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT?
WE HAVE FILED AN I.P. PORTFOLIO.
SO WE FILED A UTILITY PATENT.
FILED.
WE HAVE A DESIGN PATENT.
SO WE'RE PATENT-PENDING.
YOU HAVE A DESIGN PATENT.
YOU'RE PATENT-PENDING.
SO LET'S ASSUME YOU'RE
SUCCESSFUL, AND YOU
ACHIEVE FULL PATENT.
YEAH, WE HAVE TO ASSUME
YOU'RE GONNA GET A PATENT.
SO LET'S ASSUME THAT.
OKAY.
I COULD TALK ABOUT THE OTHER --
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT SOMEBODY --
WE SHOULDN'T
ASSUME THAT?
NO.
NO. WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME?
YOU SHOULDN'T
ASSUME THAT.
NO. OKAY.
BUT LET'S JUST SAY -- I'M
TRYING TO BE THE UPSIDE CASE.
I AM ACTUALLY TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT HOW IT'S POSSIBLE,
UNDER ANY SCENARIO
ON THIS PLANET EARTH,
THAT THIS BUSINESS TODAY
IS WORTH $20 MILLION.
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU MAKE
ON THE $1.2 MILLION IN SALES?
SO, WE'VE NETTED
APPROXIMATELY 14%.
NO, NO, BUT HANG ON,
LINDSEY.
WE EXPECT THAT.
BUT HOW MANY DO YOU SELL
IN EACH BOUTIQUE?
SO, WE -- YEP, WE -- WELL,
THE VALUATION IS ON AVERAGE,
WE HAVE 500 MATS PER YEAR
PER BOUTIQUE.
SO NEXT YEAR, THE BEST CASE IS
$5 MILLION IN SALES, YOU THINK?
I PERSONALLY THINK WE'LL DO
$10 MILLION IN SALES NEXT YEAR.
SO, FROM ALL THIS, YOU'VE
CREATED $1.2 MILLION IN SALES.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE $140,000
BEFORE YOU PAY YOURSELF.
YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT
NEXT YEAR'S $10 MILLION, RIGHT?
YEP.
AFTER THAT, $20 MILLION?
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AUSTRALIA,
THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE
OF HUNDREDS OF COUNTRIES
WE MET.
YOU KNOW, A CONTAINER
IS $50,000, $100,000 ORDER.
THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE ORDERING
A CONTAINER EVERY MONTH.
WHO? WHO SAID THAT?
OH, DISTRIBUTORS.
DID THEY GIVE YOU AN ORDER?
YEAH. UM...
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S SOLD THROUGH.
OH, YEAH. YES.
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SHIPPED
THE FIRST ORDER TO AUSTRALIA.
I LOVE THE OPTIMISM.
YEAH.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DATA.
YOU COME IN HERE ASKING FOR
A $20 MILLION VALUATION.
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE
SKEPTICAL.
YEP.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO HAVE SOME DATA.
STOP TELLING ME AUSTRALIA'S
GONNA TAKE SO MANY CONTAINERS.
OH, BUT THAT'S ONE.
SO WE'RE IN CANADA.
WE'RE IN SOUTH KOREA.
WE'RE IN --
LOOK,
YOU'RE ALL OVER THE MAP.
I LIKE TO BUILD A SOLID BUSINESS
ON A SOLID FOUNDATION.
WHEN YOU ASK FOR $20 MILLION,
YOU BETTER HAVE SOLID DATA,
NOT A STORY. I'M OUT.
TO ME,
IT'S LIKE SHARKONOMICS 101.
IF YOU COME IN WITH TOO HIGH
A VALUATION,
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
YEP.
YOU KNOW, THE ENTHUSIASM FOR IT,
I GET IT,
BUT I SEE A HUGE CONCERN
WITH THE PATENT,
A HUGE CONCERN WITH IT
BEING VERY EARLY ON,
AND SO FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS THE RISK
IS ALL ON ME AS THE INVESTOR.
I TRY AND TRANSLATE
YOUR OPTIMISM AND YOUR I.P.,
WHICH HASN'T CLEARED YET.
ALL OF THESE THINGS
ARE UNKNOWNS.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
A MILLION BUCKS IS A LOT FOR 5%.
SO HERE'S A DEAL
THAT I'LL MAKE YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $1 MILLION
FOR 5%.
IF YOU DON'T HIT $10 MILLION
NEXT YEAR IN SALES, I GET 20%.
YOU'RE THROWING ALL THE RISK
BACK ON HER.
LINDSEY'S OPTIMISTIC
SALES PROJECTIONS.
SO, HERE'S A DEAL
THAT I'LL MAKE YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $1 MILLION
FOR 5%.
IF YOU DON'T HIT $10 MILLION
NEXT YEAR IN SALES,
I GET 20%.
YOU'RE THROWING ALL THE RISK
BACK ON HER.
BECAUSE I THINK THE BUSINESS
TODAY IS WORTH 5 MILLION BUCKS
IF YOUR PATENT CLEARS.
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO VALUE THIS BUSINESS.
I APPRECIATE --
I AM HUMBLED, BUT I --
BUT YOU TOLD ME
YOU'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC.
SO I GOT TO BUY INTO IT,
RIGHT?
I MEAN, IF YOU COULD
GO AND SEE THE RESPONSE.
I MEAN, WE WERE AT
THE WORLD'S LARGEST --
YEAH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
LINDSEY, LINDSEY,
DON'T GO THERE. DON'T GO THERE.
LINDSEY, YOU'RE TALKING
IN CIRCLES NOW.
O'Leary:
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M NOT GONNA DO A DEAL
WITH YOU NO MATTER WHAT
BECAUSE I WOULD GO NUTS.
Corcoran: WHAT DISTURBS ME IS
YOU ARE GIVING US A PRICE TODAY
ON WHAT THE BUSINESS WILL BE
WORTH FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OUT.
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $1 MILLION.
BUT I WANT TO PAY IT OVER
FOUR YEARS -- $250,000 A YEAR.
OKAY.
THE RESTRICTIONS ON THAT --
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE 5%?
YES, I AM HAPPY WITH THE 5%
BECAUSE I TOTALLY
BELIEVE IN HER.
I THINK YOU HAVE GOT
A RUNAWAY PRODUCT,
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY
BECAUSE OF YOUR OPTIMISM.
I THINK YOU NEED
A HEAVYWEIGHT,
SEASONED PERSON
WHO HAS BUILT BUSINESSES.
YEAH.
THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO
IS THROW $1 MILLION AT YOU.
I THINK WHAT I HAVE TO WORK INTO
THE DEAL ARE TWO CONTINGENCIES.
I THINK, ONE, I HAVE TO KNOW
THAT YOU GET THE PATENT.
YEAH.
SECONDLY,
I THINK WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH
THE BENCHMARKS
YOU CITED OVER --
I'M HAPPY TO PAY OUT
THE MONEY OVER FOUR YEARS --
OVER FOUR YEARS,
YOU HIT THOSE TARGETS.
AND SO I -- I --
I APPRECIATE THAT OFFER.
AND I'D LOVE TO ASK
YOU GUYS --
SO, MR. WONDERFUL,
WHAT IS YOUR VISION,
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE INVOLVED
IN THE COMPANY?
WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT YOU WOULD
DO FOR THE PRODUCT?
MY CONCERNS ARE THIS -- I'M
GONNA HELP YOU WITH THE LEGALS,
ASSUMING THIS PATENT
ACTUALLY GETS ISSUED
BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA
GET KNOCKED OFF,
AND I WILL PROTECT IT.
NUMBER TWO,
I WILL MAKE THIS FAMOUS ONLINE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION
ABOUT THAT.
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
REALLY MAXIMIZED THAT.
SO MY FOCUS IN THE SHORT TERM
WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY WORK HARD,
THAT YOU DID HIT
THE $10 MILLION,
AND I ONLY STAYED AT 5%.
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
YEAH.
I'D RATHER YOU MADE IT
'CAUSE I THINK THE CHANCE
OF THIS BEING ACQUIRED IS HIGH.
AND I'M THINKING ABOUT CHANGING
MY OFFER AS I'M SITTING HERE.
I HAVE TO BE HONEST. I AM
IN A VERY GENEROUS MOOD TODAY.
SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS,
LINDSEY.
YOU HAD TWO OFFERS.
YOU'RE LETTING THEM GO.
WELL, NO, AND I, HONESTLY --
I --
MAKE A DECISION.
STOP SELLING.
BUT, LINDSEY, HE GAVE YOU
WHAT YOU WERE ASKING FOR.
HE GAVE YOU THE $1 MILLION
FOR THE SAME EQUITY
BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID --
THE WORDS THAT CAME OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH.
ABSOLUTELY, BUT IT'S BASED ON
CONTINGENCIES OF SELLING.
BUT IT'S WHAT YOU SAID!
BUT THERE SHOULD BE
NO RISK THERE.
THAT SHOULD BE
A SLAM DUNK.
BUT YOU SAID IT.
AND --
WHY DID YOU SAY IT
IF YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT?
I WANT TO DRAW A PARALLEL
BETWEEN YOU AND I...
YEAH.
...'CAUSE I WAS IN YOUR SHOES,
WITH WILD ENTHUSIASM,
WANTING TO BE THE QUEEN
OF NEW YORK REAL ESTATE
WHEN I WAS 22 YEARS OLD.
YEAH.
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
IN MY JOURNEY
TO MAKE IT WASN'T MY OPTIMISM,
WHICH I HAD IN SPADES,
BUT IT WAS THE SELF DOUBT
AND THE INSECURITY THAT I FELT
ALL ALONG THE WAY
THAT MADE ME PAUSE AND THINK,
"OH, MY GOD,
I BETTER BE CAREFUL.
CAN I DO IT?
HOW WILL I MAKE IT?
WHO DO I USE?
WHO DO I TRUST?"
MY JUDGMENT CARD
BUILT MY BUSINESS.
YOU'RE A WILD-ASS,
ENTHUSIASTIC ENTREPRENEUR,
VERY CAPABLE.
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT PRODUCT.
ALL THAT'S FINE, BUT YOU'RE
MISSING THE SELF-DOUBT CARD.
WELL SAID, BARBARA.
OKAY, I'M SORRY.
I JUST --
LIKE I SAID, CULTURALLY,
I'M TRYING TO BUILD A COMPANY
THAT IS THE RIGHT FIT
FOR EVERYBODY,
SO I'M THINKING MAYBE
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT FIT,
SO I WILL PASS.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, LINDSEY.
Cuban:
GOOD LUCK, LINDSEY.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
Corcoran: GOOD LUCK.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I'M GLAD THAT
WE DIDN'T DO A DEAL
'CAUSE IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.
SO IF I WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING,
IT WOULD BE --
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S
THE RIGHT VALUATION.
BARBARA, I THINK THAT WAS THE
BEST ADVICE YOU'VE EVER GIVEN.
MM-HMM.
SHE'S WILDLY OPTIMISTIC.
YEP.
MM.
BUT GREAT ENTREPRENEURS
LIVE IN PARANOIA.
SHE'S JUST BLINDED
BY THE LIGHT.
