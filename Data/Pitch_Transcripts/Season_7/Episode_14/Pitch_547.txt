MY NAME IS DAVID HEGARTY,
AND I'M FROM
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA.
MY COMPANY IS FIXED,
AND WE ARE SEEKING A $700,000
INVESTMENT FOR 5% EQUITY STAKE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST TIME
THAT YOU GUYS GOT
A PARKING TICKET.
WHAT WAS THAT ONE EMOTION
YOU FELT
MORE THAN ALL
THE OTHER EMOTIONS?
ANGER, RIGHT?
WHAT IS IT
ABOUT A PARKING TICKET
THAT GENERATES SUCH ANGER IN US?
IT'S THE INJUSTICE
OF THE SITUATION.
YOU KNOW THAT THEY MAKE THESE
SIGNS CONFUSING ON PURPOSE.
YOU KNOW THAT THEY SIT
BY THE METER
WAITING FOR IT TO EXPIRE.
YOU KNOW THAT THE MAN
HAS JUST SCREWED YOU OVER...
[ LAUGHS ]
...AND THERE IS NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.
O'Leary: UNTIL NOW.
UNTIL NOW.
FIXED IS THE APP
THAT FIGHTS BACK.
SO, HOW DOES IT WORK?
STEP ONE -- TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH
OF YOUR PARKING TICKET.
STEP TWO -- THAT'S IT.
THERE IS NO STEP TWO.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
WE TAKE THAT PARKING TICKET,
WE RUN IT THROUGH
OUR PROPRIETARY ALGORITHM
TO LOOK FOR ISSUES AND ERRORS
THAT MAKE THAT TICKET INVALID.
WHEN WE FIND AN ISSUE,
WE ASSEMBLE A CONTEST LETTER
ON YOUR BEHALF
AND SEND IT TO THE CITY.
FOUR WEEKS LATER, YOU FIND OUT
THAT YOUR TICKET
HAS BEEN DEALT WITH.
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO EXPAND TO AS MANY CITIES
AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN
BECAUSE EVERY CITY NEEDS
A TICKET HERO.
-OH. [ LAUGHS ]
-[ LAUGHS ]
SO, TELL US
THE BUSINESS MODEL.
CERTAINLY.
IT'S A FREE APP DOWNLOAD.
YOU SUBMIT YOUR TICKET.
IF WE BEAT YOUR TICKET,
WE CHARGE A 35% SUCCESS FEE.
WHAT'S THE SUCCESS RATE?
WE WIN ABOUT 20% TO 30%
OF OUR CONTESTS.
SO, HOW MANY PEOPLE
JUST DO IT THEMSELVES?
SO, IN SAN FRANCISCO,
ONLY 5% OF PARKING TICKETS
ARE CONTESTED,
AND THOSE THAT ARE CONTESTED,
I THINK THE WIN RATE
IS ABOUT 20%.
WHAT IS THE TYPICAL REASON
THAT A TICKET WOULD BE --
DISMISSED?
DISMISSED, YEAH.
THERE'S LOTS
OF DIFFERENT REASONS.
SO, INITIALLY,
WE LOOK FOR ERRORS.
SO, THE STATUTORY INFORMATION
THAT THE OFFICER
HAS TO WRITE DOWN.
FREQUENTLY, THEY'RE IN A RUSH,
THEY DON'T WRITE
THAT INFORMATION,
THEY MADE A TYPO
ON THE LICENSE PLATE,
THEY WROTE ACURA
WHEN IT'S AN AUDI.
WE LOOK FOR ALL THESE ISSUES
THAT MAKE THE TICKET INVALID.
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY
SELLING A HIGHER SUCCESS RATE.
YOU'RE REALLY SELLING THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE CONTESTING.
'CAUSE ONLY 5% OF PEOPLE
ACTUALLY CONTEST.
WE'RE ACTUALLY SELLING BOTH.
SO, FIRSTLY IT'S TIME CONSUMING.
ADDITIONALLY,
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT THEIR TICKET IS INVALID
FOR, LIKE, X, Y, AND Z,
SO WE'RE BASICALLY WINNING
THOSE TICKETS THEY WOULD NEVER
HAVE CONTESTED.
BUT DAVID, HOW MANY TICKETS
ARE ISSUED PER YEAR IN AMERICA?
WE ESTIMATE 100 MILLION TICKETS
WRITTEN A YEAR.
SO, THIS IS A MAJOR SOURCE
OF INCOME FOR THE POLICE.
OH, A HUGE SOURCE.
WHAT'S THE AVERAGE PENALTY,
OR TICKET?
IN SAN FRANCISCO,
THE AVERAGE TICKET IS ABOUT $70.
ARE YOU OPERATING
ANYWHERE ELSE RIGHT NOW?
YEAH, WE ARE IN SAN FRANCISCO,
OAKLAND, LOS ANGELES,
AND NEW YORK.
ALL RIGHT,
TELL US ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE A $14 MILLION VALUE
ON THE BUSINESS.
YEAH.
IT MUST BE HUGE.
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
THIS YEAR ALONE,
I THINK WE'VE DONE $80,000
IN -- IN NET -- NET REVENUE.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO CONTEST A TICKET?
BETWEEN THE CROWD WORKERS,
THE SOFTWARE,
PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT WORKING AT
YOUR PLACE, WHAT DOES IT COST?
FROM AN AVERAGE TICKET,
WE MAKE ABOUT 5 TO 6 BUCKS
IN REVENUE.
YOU ONLY MAKE $5 OR $6
PER SUCCESS?
THAT'S A COMBINATION
OF OUR 35% WIN RATE
WHEN WE BEAT THE TICKET,
AND IF WE HAVE TO PAY
THE TICKET FOR YOU,
WE CHARGE YOU
A $1.95 CONVENIENCE FEE.
WHAT'S IT COST TO ACQUIRE
THE INCREMENTAL CUSTOMER?
WE ACQUIRE USERS
FOR A BLENDED AVERAGE
OF ABOUT 4 TO 5 BUCKS.
-THAT'S NOT EXCITING.
-IS THAT PAID MARKETING?
I MEAN, IS THAT FACEBOOK
AND TWITTER ADS?
UH, NO.
WE HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE
THAT FOLLOW THE STREET-CLEANING
VEHICLES IN THE CITY...
[ LAUGHS ]
COME ON.
...AND PUT A FLYER ON THE CARS
THAT HAVE A PARKING TICKET.
OOH.
IT'S ACTUALLY SMART.
IT'S JUST EXPENSIVE.
IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE.
YOU MAKE $5 AVERAGE
ON PROFIT.
IT COSTS YOU $5
TO ACQUIRE THE CUSTOMER.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL
MARK CUBAN SHOULD PUT
SOME MONEY INTO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE -- NO, NO.
SO, ONCE WE HAVE THE USER,
WE HAVE A 70% RETENTION RATE.
SO, OUR -- OUR USERS --
THE ONLY WAY YOU GROW IT
IS THAT THEY ABUSE THE LAW
MORE AND MORE.
THEY CONSTANTLY GET
MORE PARKING TICKETS.
NO,
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
-NO.
-THEY GET ABUSED BY THE LAW.
ON -- ON AVERAGE, OUR USERS GET
ABOUT SIX PARKING TICKETS
A YEAR.
Sacca: I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
THE COST SIDE OF THIS BUSINESS.
I JUST DON'T THINK
THERE'S GONNA BE
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO USE IT,
ULTIMATELY.
BUT DAVID --
SO, I THINK IT'S HARD
FOR YOU TO FIND THE USERS,
AND FRANKLY, YOU KNOW,
I'M AN INVESTOR IN UBER.
YEAH.
AND UBER HAS SHOWN
THAT CAR OWNERSHIP
IS GOING AWAY.
OKAY, SO -- OKAY.
SO YOU'VE GOT A SHRINKING MARKET
YOU'RE ADDRESSING.
BUT LET ME PAINT THIS VISION
FOR YOU, RIGHT?
PARKING TICKETS ALONE
IS ABOUT A $500 MILLION
OPPORTUNITY FOR US.
SPEEDING TICKETS
AND MOVING VIOLATIONS,
THAT'S ANOTHER $3 BILLION TO
$4 BILLION OPPORTUNITY FOR US.
SO, YOU'RE GOING
TO GET PEOPLE
OFF OF SPEEDING TICKETS,
AS WELL?
CORRECT.
FOR MOST PEOPLE,
IT'S THE SAME THING.
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES
AND ERRORS IN THE TICKET
THAT THEY'RE UNAWARE OF.
WE WANT TO HELP USERS
BASICALLY HANDLE
THEIR MOVING VIOLATIONS
MORE EFFICIENTLY.
THERE'S $100 BILLION SPENT
EACH YEAR IN THE U.S.
BY CONSUMERS
ON LEGAL SERVICES.
SO, WE HAVE ACQUIRED
40,000 USERS OVER A YEAR.
THEY ALREADY SENT US
THEIR TRAFFIC TICKETS.
THEY'RE LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THIS."
YOUR BUSINESS
IS BRINGING IN CUSTOMERS...
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
...THAT YOU CAN SCALE UP
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.
WE ARE --
BUT I GET IT,
AND IT'S CLEVER.
YEAH.
HOW IS THAT WORTH
$14 MILLION TODAY?
OKAY, SO I'LL --
I'LL BREAK IT DOWN.
IF WE CONTINUE THE GROWTH
WE HAVE WITH PARKING TICKETS
TO THE END OF THIS YEAR,
WE'LL BE AT AN $11 MILLION
REVENUE RUN RATE.
YOU'RE GONNA GO FROM $80,000 NOW
TO $11 MILLION NEXT YEAR?
AT A RUN RATE
BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR.
SINCE JANUARY THIS YEAR,
WE'VE BEEN GROWING
AT 33% MONTH OVER MONTH.
IF MY 3 YEAR OLD
CONTINUES TO GROW
AT THE SAME RATE
SHE'S GROWING NOW,
SHE'S GONNA BE AN EIGHT-FOOTER
WITHIN A FEW YEARS
AND SHE'LL BE PLAYING
IN THE WNBA.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO TRAFFIC
AND OTHER MOVING VIOLATIONS YET.
HOW MUCH MONEY
HAVE YOU RAISED?
WE'VE RAISED $1.8 MILLION
IN TOTAL.
-AT WHAT VALUE?
-THAT'S NOT BAD.
THE LAST ROUND
WAS AT A $10 MILLION CAP.
WOW!
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
DAVID, PHILOSOPHICALLY.
YOUR BASIC PREMISE IS
YOU BUILD OUT TO OTHER SERVICES,
YOU'RE GONNA SHRINK
GOVERNMENT REVENUES.
THAT'S BASICALLY IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE CHANCES ARE
YOU'RE GONNA GET AUDITED
A LOT?
[ LAUGHTER ]
UH, LISTEN,
I'M NOT BUYING THE SCALE
FROM $80,000 TO $11 MILLION
RUN RATE NEXT YEAR.
I'M OUT.
HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH IT,
OKAY?
I'M IN THE MUTUAL FUND
BUSINESS.
I'M THE MOST REGULATED GUY
IN THE WORLD.
THE GOVERNMENT LOOKS
AT MY BUSINESS EVERY DAY.
THEY LET ME MAKE MONEY
BECAUSE I STAY COMPLIANT.
YEAH.
I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO INVEST IN A BUSINESS
THAT GOES TO WAR
WITH GOVERNMENT REVENUE.
I JUST THINK
IT'S BAD KARMA FOR ME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THE PROBLEM FOR ME IS
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $700,000
FOR A 5% EQUITY STAKE.
[ Sarcastically ]
IT'S A STEAL.
I THINK YOU'RE, LIKE,
JUST CLIMBING
THE MOUNTAIN OF THIS.
MM-HMM.
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THERE YET,
AND I CAN'T WRAP MY HANDS AROUND
IF IT'S GONNA REALLY
WORK OR NOT.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
MARK CUBAN IS DAVID'S LAST
CHANCE TO GET A DEAL FOR FIXED,
AN APP THAT FIGHTS
PARKING TICKETS.
SO, THE CONCEPT
OF US STANDING OUT THERE
AND SAYING, "YOU KNOW WHAT,
THE GOVERNMENT
HAS COME AFTER YOU
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD
A GARAGE, BECAUSE" --
I LOVE THAT IDEA.
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
I THINK OPERATIONALLY,
THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES
IN ORDER TO SCALE
FAR MORE QUICKLY THAT
I CAN HELP YOU WITH.
SO, WHAT I'LL OFFER YOU
IS YOUR $700,000...
FOR 7%, RIGHT?
AND WE CAN STRUCTURE
THAT EXTRA 2%
AS ADVISORY FEES,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
THAT --
THAT MAKES IT A FLAT ROUND,
WHICH IS NOT GREAT
FOR OUR EXISTING INVESTORS.
NOT IF IT'S 2%
FOR ADVISORY FEES.
IT'S NOT A FLAT ROUND.
THAT MEANS YOU PUT NO VALUE
ON A SHARK.
WELL, WE'VE PROGRESSED A TON
SINCE WE -- OUR LAST --
THAT'S FINE.
OKAY, SO --
AND YOU'RE GONNA PROGRESS
EVEN MORE WHEN I GET INVOLVED.
I-I GET THAT.
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I HAVE YOU ON --
LIKE, 2% IS A LOT, A LOT.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT'S TIME --
YOU CAN E-MAIL ME ANYTIME
NIGHT OR DAY,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
A RETURN E-MAIL FROM ME
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
MAKE A DECISION.
'CAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE GETTING
A PARKING TICKET OUTSIDE
RIGHT NOW.
Hegarty:
WE HAVE A BIG VISION.
NOW THAT MARK
IS PART OF THAT VISION,
IT REALLY IS
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
HE'S A CONTRARIAN THINKER,
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED
ON THE TEAM.
Narrator: IN SEASON FIVE,
ROB DICKENS AND BRAD SCUDDER
STRUCK A DEAL WITH MARK CUBAN
FOR THEIR EVENTS COMPANY
RUGGED RACES.
WE'D LIKE TO STRIKE A DEAL
WITH YOU.
-$1.75 MILLION FOR THE 25%.
-DEAL.
LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
[ AIR HORN BLOWS ]
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
LIKE MANIACS
SINCE WE MADE OUR DEAL
ON "SHARK TANK."
MARK CUBAN INVESTED
$1.75 MILLION IN OUR COMPANY,
AND THAT'S ALLOWED US
TO REALLY ACCELERATE OUR GROWTH.
WE'VE EXPANDED TO 28 CITIES,
AND OUR ATTENDANCE HAS EXPLODED.
OVER 200,000 PEOPLE HAVE NOW
REGISTERED FOR OUR RACES,
AND WE'RE GETTING AS MANY
AS 18,000 PEOPLE OUT
TO A SINGLE EVENT.
THIS HAS ALL TRANSLATED
INTO HUGE SALES FOR US.
IN THE YEAR BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD $4.2 MILLION.
AFTER "SHARK TANK," WE'VE GOT
$10.5 MILLION IN SALES.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
HERE'S THE COURSE MAP
FOR OUR NEW ENGLAND EVENT
TOMORROW.
WE'VE MOVED TO NEW OFFICES,
WE'VE HIRED 20 NEW PEOPLE.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SPACE NOW
THAT'S REALLY HELPING OUR
CREATIVITY AND OUR PRODUCTION.
What's up, guys?
HOW YOU DOING, MARK?
SAYING THAT WE ARE PARTNERS
WITH MARK CUBAN OPENS DOORS.
Where are we at with sponsors?
I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE 30% TO
40% GROWTH GOING INTO NEXT YEAR.
VENUES NOW WANT
TO WORK WITH US,
SPONSORS NOW WANT
TO WORK WITH US.
HAVING MARK ON OUR TEAM
REALLY GIVES US A FOOT UP
ON EVERYBODY ELSE.
Keep in touch,
and congratulations, guys.
HEY, THANKS, MARK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS A LOT.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
GOOD JOB.
