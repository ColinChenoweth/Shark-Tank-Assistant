WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG THINGS
PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE.
WE'VE ALREADY EXPANDED
INTO CANADA.
WE HAVE A NEW EVENT SERIES
CALLED COSTUME DASH 5K,
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER
EVENT PRODUCTION
OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL.
WHEN PEOPLE THINK
OF OBSTACLE COURSE RACING,
WE WANT THEM TO THINK
RUGGED MANIAC.
WE WANT TO BE THE PINNACLE
OF THE SPORT.
MANIAC!
MANIAC!
MANIAC!
MANIAC!
[ ALL CHEERING ]
I'M ANN.
AND I'M DAVE.
AND WE LIVE
IN PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA,
WITH OUR KIDS MAYA,
DEREK, AND BEN.
OUR KIDS ARE ABSOLUTELY
THE CENTER OF OUR WORLD.
BECOMING A PARENT IS AMAZING,
BUT IS ALSO SCARY.
SO CLOSE.
YAY!
WHEN MY DAUGHTER MAYA WAS BORN,
I TRIED TO BREASTFEED HER,
BUT I REALIZED THAT
SHE WAS LOSING TOO MUCH WEIGHT.
I WAS REALLY ANXIOUS,
AND I TOOK HER
TO THE DOCTOR REGULARLY
TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS
GROWING AND THAT SHE WAS OKAY.
WE KNOW HOW SCARY IT IS
TO BRING A BABY HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL
AND TO NOT KNOW
HOW SHE'S DEVELOPING.
WE WANT TO HELP EASE
SOME OF THOSE WORRIES
THAT EVERY NEW PARENT HAS.
WE HAVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE
IN THE BABY INDUSTRY,
BUT WE'VE NEVER SOLD
A PHYSICAL PRODUCT BEFORE.
WE WANT THE SHARKS BECAUSE
WE'VE SEEN THE POWER
OF WHAT THEY CAN DO
FOR BUSINESSES,
AND WE ARE
ABSOLUTELY THRILLED
TO GET THE CHANCE
TO PITCH TO THEM.
HI.
MY NAME IS ANN CRADY-WEISS.
AND I'M HER HUSBAND
DAVE WEISS.
AND TOGETHER, WE'RE
THE CO-FOUNDERS OF HATCH BABY.
WE ARE SEEKING $250,000
FOR 2.5% OF OUR COMPANY.
BECOMING A NEW PARENT
IS FULL OF WONDER.
AND WORRY.
IT IS SCARY TO BRING A NEW
INFANT HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL
AND TO BLINDLY TRUST THAT
SHE'S DEVELOPING AS SHE SHOULD.
THE BIGGEST PREDICTOR
OF INFANT HEALTH
IN THE EARLY DAYS
IS WEIGHT GAIN.
BABIES ARE CHECKED
AT DOCTOR'S VISITS,
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE TIME
IN BETWEEN THOSE VISITS?
WE'RE HERE
TO PUT PARENT'S MINDS AT EASE.
WE DEVELOPED
THE SMART CHANGING PAD.
IT'S A MODERN RE-DESIGN
OF THE TRADITIONAL
DIAPER-CHANGING PAD
FOUND
IN EVERY BABY NURSERY.
IT HAS A BUILT-IN
WI-FI ENABLED SCALE
SO THAT YOU CAN SEE
HOW MUCH YOUR BABY WEIGHS
AND TELL HOW MUCH YOU'RE NURSING
DURING A FEEDING.
ALL OF THE INFORMATION SYNCS
TO YOUR SMARTPHONE.
NO MATTER WHO IS TAKING CARE
OF YOUR BABY,
YOU CAN CHECK IN ANYTIME,
ANYWHERE,
AND BE READY TO SHARE
ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU AND
YOUR PEDIATRICIAN CARE ABOUT,
AND THAT LEAVES MORE TIME
FOR THE GOOD STUFF.
SHARKS, PLEASE JOIN US
IN HELPING BABIES STAY ON TRACK
AND PARENTS STAY SANE.
WE WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS.
INTERESTING,
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT PRODUCT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT
ANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE,
BUT DO I REALLY NEED TO KNOW
THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL EVERY TIME?
WHEN I FIRST BECAME A MOM
12 YEARS AGO, I PREPARED A TON.
AND THEN I BROUGHT MY BABY HOME,
AND I WAS TERRIFIED.
I REALLY WANTED
TO BREASTFEED HER,
BUT WHY WAS SHE CRYING?
WAS SHE CRYING BECAUSE
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH?
WAS SHE CRYING
FOR ANOTHER REASON?
WHY WAS SHE CRYING?
AND I KNOW NOW
THAT I'M NOT ALONE.
MORE THAN 90% OF MOMS
HAVE ANXIETY IN THE FIRST WEEKS.
MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF MOMS
DON'T MEET THEIR OWN
BREASTFEEDING GOALS
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THEIR SUPPLY.
HOW DID THE SCALE
HELP YOU WITH THAT?
HOW DOES THIS
TRACK ANY OF THAT?
-YEAH.
-SO, THE WAY IT TRACKS IT
IS BEFORE YOU NURSE,
YOU DO YOUR NORMAL THING,
YOU CHANGE YOUR BABY.
YOU TAP THE FEEDING BUTTON,
RECORDS A WEIGHT.
YOU GO AND YOU NURSE YOUR BABY,
THEN YOU BRING THE BABY BACK,
TOUCH THE SAME BUTTON AGAIN,
PUT THE BABY DOWN,
IT'LL TELL YOU
YOU FED 2.75 OUNCES.
-IT'S THAT SENSITIVE A SCALE?
-IT'S THAT SENSITIVE A SCALE.
THAT'S THE PRIMARY FUNCTION
OF HATCH BABY
IS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH BREAST
MILK THE CHILD IS CONSUMING?
THE PRIMARY FUNCTION
OF HATCH BABY
IS TO REASSURE PARENTS
THAT THEIR BABIES ARE DEVELOPING
AS THEY SHOULD BE
AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE
THAT MOMS CAN MEET
THEIR OWN BREASTFEEDING GOALS.
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY YET?
WE HAVE NOT SOLD ANY.
THIS IS IN PREPRODUCTION.
SO, WE LAUNCHED OUR WEBSITE
LAST WEEK.
WE'RE DOING PRE-SALES
IN THE COMING WEEKS.
LAST WEEK?
AND WE WILL HAVE PRODUCT
SHIPPING TO MOMS
IN THE COMING MONTH.
SO, YOU'VE GOT
A $10 MILLION VALUATION
ON THE PRE-REVENUE,
PRE-NOTHING.
AND WE'D LOVE
TO TELL YOU WHY.
OH, WE WANT TO HEAR IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ Laughing ]
I BET YOU DO.
I REALLY WANT
TO HEAR THIS.
WE ARE EXPERIENCED
ENTREPRENEURS AND EXECUTIVES
IN THIS INDUSTRY.
SO, I STARTED A COMPANY
THAT I SOLD
TO JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON.
JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON HAS A DIVISION
CALLED BabyCenter.
40 MILLION MOMS WORLDWIDE
USE BabyCenter.
DAVE AND I MET AT BabyCenter,
AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
WE RAN EVERYTHING
CONSUMER-FACING.
WE RAN PRODUCT,
EDITORIAL,
DESIGN, ENGINEERING,
AND MARKETING.
IT IS LITERALLY THE PLACE YOU GO
FOR ANSWERS IN THIS SPACE.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TWO YOUNG GIRLS
AND ONE MORE ON THE WAY,
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE FREAKED OUT,
YOU NEED AN ANSWER.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO
ABOUT THIS FEVER,
THAT COLOR POOP,
YOU'RE GOING TO BabyCenter.
-YEAH.
-SO, YOU'VE GOT
GREAT EXPERIENCE.
SOLD ME ON THAT.
CHECK.
SO, TO GO ON
ABOUT THE VALUATION,
THE WAY WE GOT TO IT IS WE WENT
BACK TO THE SAME INVESTORS
WHO FUNDED MY LAST COMPANY.
WE RAISED $1.7 MILLION
ON A CONVERTIBLE NOTE
LAST SEPTEMBER
WHEN THIS WAS ESSENTIALLY
CONCEPT PHASE.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT HAS LEGS?
WELL, OUR EXPERIENCE
FROM BabyCenter TELLS US
THAT THIS IS A PRODUCT
THAT MOMS WANT.
THERE'S A LOT MORE INFORMATION
YOU WANT TO TRACK
OTHER THAN JUST THINGS
THAT ARE WEIGHT-BASED.
ABSOLUTELY,
AND WE SEE THE FUTURE.
WE SEE THERE ABSOLUTELY
WILL BE A SMART NURSERY AND --
Sacca: ONE OF THE THINGS
I THINK YOU'VE MISSED
IS THAT APART FROM
JUST DEALING WITH THE ANXIETY,
THERE'S JUST THE VANITY
AND THE GEEKY DESIRE
TO AGGREGATE ALL THIS DATA.
-BUT I COULD GET
A SENSITIVE SCALE...
-YOU COULD WEIGH A BABY.
...AND I COULD WEIGH THE CHILD
BEFORE AND AFTER. SURE.
AND THERE'S -- I'M SURE
THERE'S BLUETOOTH-BASED SCALES
THAT CONNECT TO AN APP.
TALK ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
PRICE TO MAKE IT,
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT FOR.
SO, TO MAKE IT, IT COSTS $89,
AND WE'LL SELL IT FOR $299.
WOW.
AND THE PRICE IS IN LINE
WITH OTHER PREMIUM
BABY PRODUCTS OUT THERE.
O'Leary:
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY
THAT MAKES $33,000 A YEAR...
RIGHT.
...CAN I REALLY GET
$250 WORTH OF VALUE
FROM A SCALE?
SOME WANT TO PAY MORE
BECAUSE THIS IS THE HEALTH
AND SAFETY OF THEIR BABY.
BUT ALSO, WE CAN LOOK
AT OTHER COMPARABLES
LIKE THE STROLLER MARKET.
YOU LOOK AT, YOU KNOW,
20 YEARS AGO,
STROLLERS WERE A UTILITY.
WE USE THEM
TO PUSH OUR KIDS AROUND.
NOW THEY ARE, YOU KNOW,
$500 IS THE MINIMUM,
AND THEY ARE SELLING
LIKE HOTCAKES.
YOU HAVE SO -- SO MUCH
CREDIBILITY IN THIS SPACE.
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD BE
A GREAT RECORDING ARTIST.
GETS A HUGE HIT ALBUM,
YOU KNOW?
AND THEN THE NEXT ALBUM,
FIVE TRACKS SUCK.
-YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.
-[ LAUGHS ]
SO -- SO, WE DISAGREE.
I KNOW I --
O'Leary:
OF COURSE WE DISAGREE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A SCALE --
A $300 SCALE,
THAT IS --
YOU COULD SAY THAT A FITBIT
WAS A $100 PEDOMETER.
THEY'RE ABOUT TO I.P.O.
FOR A BILLION DOLLARS,
AND WE'RE BACKED
BY THE SAME PEOPLE.
THE BABY MARKET
TIME AND TIME AGAIN HAS SHOWN
THAT PRICE IS NOT WHAT PARENTS
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.
I AGREE.
ANY TIME
IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
THAT YOU WILL THROW
YOUR BUDGET OUT THE WINDOW,
IT IS FOR YOUR BABY.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET IT
TO MARKET?
AT FIRST, WE'RE EXCLUSIVELY
SELLING ONLINE ON OUR SITE.
AND SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA SELL IN THE FIRST YEAR?
SO, IN THE FIRST YEAR,
WE FORECAST WE'RE GONNA SELL
20,000 UNITS.
20,000 UNITS?
WHAT'S THE REVENUE OF THAT?
$6 MILLION.
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO 20,000 UNITS
FIRST YEAR?
YES.
WE THINK
IT'S A TINY FRACTION
OF 1% OF THE CHANGING PAD
MARKET.
-WE THINK --
-IT IS, BUT IT'S OPTIMISTIC.
THE CHALLENGE IS
WHETHER YOUR DEVICE WILL WIN
IN THAT COMPETITION
WITH ALL THE OTHER DEVICES.
I'M NOT BUYING THAT IT IS.
THERE'S NO QUESTION
THAT THERE ARE OTHER PLAYERS
IN THE SMART BABY MARKET,
BUT ABSOLUTELY
SOMEONE WILL WIN,
AND WHO WOULD YOU RATHER
MAKE A BET ON?
YOU KNOW WHAT MIKE TYSON SAID,
RIGHT?
NO.
EVERYBODY HAS A PLAN UNTIL
THEY GET PUNCHED IN THE FACE.
I SEE THE VALUE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A FEATURE
OF SOME OTHER PRODUCT
OR IT'S ENOUGH
TO CARRY IT ON ITS OWN,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M GOING OUT.
Weiss: WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
CHRIS IS A NEW DAD.
WE LOVE
HIS INVESTMENT PROFILE.
WE'VE SEEN WHAT HE CAN DO
TO COMPANIES.
HE'S TWITTER, HE'S UBER,
HE'S -- HE'S AMAZING.
WE'RE SO GLAD
TO HAVE HIM AS A PARTNER.
TOTALLY.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A BUSINESS
THAT HOPES TO EASE
THE PAIN OF PAYING FOR COLLEGE.
BY NOT ADDRESSING IT
IN A MORE ORGANIZED MANNER,
BUT WE DO HAVE A PLAN.
THE PROBLEM IS
YOU CAME TOO EARLY.
IF YOU HAD ALREADY GONE
THROUGH THAT PROCESS
OF TURNING IT IN
FROM IDEA TO PLAN TO TANGIBLE,
I THINK YOU'D HAVE A SHOT,
BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE YET,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE
YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
AND THANK YOU
FOR YOUR FEEDBACK,
AND WE WILL MAKE SURE
THAT WE TAKE IT CONSTRUCTIVELY
AND IMPROVE OUR COMPANY.
THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-GOOD LUCK.
-GOOD LUCK.
-THANK YOU.
AND WE WANTED TO STAY FOCUSED ON
OUR ONLINE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL,
BUT, YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR HELP,
I THINK WE CAN GET THERE.
DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
BECAUSE YOU'LL CUT
YOUR MARGINS IN HALF.
-RIGHT.
-CORRECT.
-YOU'LL OWN A LOT OF INVENTORY.
-CORRECT.
HERE'S MY CHALLENGE WITH IT.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
YOUR MARGINS ARE FANTASTIC.
YOU MAKE ENOUGH MARGIN
TO BOOTSTRAP THIS THING.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU NEED
$100,000 TODAY FOR INVENTORY
BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT
ON YOUR OWN.
AND THAT WAY,
YOU CAN PROVE THE SCALE.
I'M JUST -- I'M NOT SURE
HOW MY MONEY IS GONNA ACCELERATE
THIS BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
Cuban:
LOOK, WHEN I LOOK AT A COMPANY,
I TRY TO SEE
WHAT THE CORE COMPETENCY IS.
WHAT IS IT THAT THEY'RE GOOD AT,
AND HOW FAR CAN THAT TAKE THEM?
REALLY WHAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT
AS YOUR CORE COMPETENCY
IS YOUR ABILITY
TO CREATE CONTENT.
IF YOU WERE TO COME IN HERE
AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS IS OUR FIRST PRODUCT.
WE ARE SO GOOD
AT CREATING CONTENT.
THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE
OF A VIRAL VIDEO WE CREATED.
HERE'S THREE OTHER THINGS
THAT WE'VE DONE."
I'D BE INTERESTED.
WE DO. WE HAVE A BEARD --
BEARD BIB THAT'S DISPOSABLE.
WE WANT TO GAIN
AS MUCH SINK SHARE AS WE CAN
FROM THE MEN'S BATHROOM.
THAT'S OUR --
SO WE WANT TO DO
COMBS AND OILS.
Sacca: SINK SHARE?
WE HAVE COMBS --
YOU WANT TO GET SINK SHARE?
THAT'S OUR --
THAT'S OUR KEY --
THAT'S YOUR KEY METRIC?
SINK SHARE, YES.
SINK SHARE.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
IF THIS WAS THE FIRST
OF MANY PRODUCTS
OF A WIDE SCOPE,
NOT JUST SINK SHARE,
BUT YOU ARE SHOWING ME
YOU ARE THE KING
OF CREATING VIRAL VIDEOS
TO SELL PRODUCTS,
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING.
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL ME.
I'M OUT.
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA,
BUT IT'S NOT A COMPANY.
IT'S A PRODUCT.
IT'S A BEARD DIAPER.
LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS.
WE HAVE A DISPOSABLE BIB,
WE HAVE BEARD OILS,
WE HAVE BEARD COMBS,
WE HAVE APPAREL.
NO, BUT I THINK ALL THAT STUFF,
I CAN GET IT IN 90,000 PLACES.
AND WE'VE HAD OTHER COMPANIES
UP HERE SELLING THE SAME THING.
CORRECT.
SURE, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN
A BEARD BIB BEFORE?
YOU HAVEN'T.
-NO, NO, BUT --
-IT'S THE FIRST IN ITS MARKET.
IT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT'S EVER BEEN --
-THE BIG THING --
THE BIB THING, I GET IT,
BUT IT'S A SINGLE PRODUCT.
HOW WOULD I GET MY MONEY BACK?
BY INVESTING IN US.
NO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH.
YOU KNOW, LOOK,
MY BEARD DAYS ARE OVER.
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE PHOTO.
BROUGHT ME DOWN MEMORY LANE.
BUT I'M OUT.
I LOVE THE LOGO,
I LOVE THE POSITIONING.
I AM A COMPANY INVESTOR.
I BUILD COMPANIES.
I INVEST FOR THE LONG TERM.
THIS IS A PRODUCT.
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'D BE THAT HELPFUL TO YOU.
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M OUT.
OKAY, GOT YOU.
I'M VERY SAD TO HEAR THAT,
I HAVE TO SAY.
AW.
WELL, THERE'S --
THERE'S ONE SHARK.
LORI.
-THERE'S ONE.
-BEARDLESS SHARK.
QUEEN LORI.
ONE BEARDLESS SHARK.
I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE
MY CROWN WITH YOU.
WELL...
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME
IS THAT THE WOMEN ARE LEFT
WITH THE HAIR IN THE SINK.
IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM.
BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY
NO SOLUTION.
RIGHT.
AND WOMEN WOULD BUY
TO KEEP THEMSELVES HAPPY.
OVER 60% OF
OUR CUSTOMER BASE IS WOMEN.
WOMEN THAT HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
A HUSBAND, A SON.
I COULD SEE IT
MAKING WOMEN HAPPY.
BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE
HOW WELL THIS WILL DO --
BEFORE YOU GO OUT, COULD
YOU MAKE US AN OFFER THEN?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT DO YOU THINK --
WHAT -- WHAT --
WHAT DO YOU THINK --
IT WOULD -- WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
ON THE EQUITY SIDE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD,
YOU KNOW, BE WORTH TO YOU
TO TAKE --
TO TAKE THAT JUMP WITH US?
