HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ANTONIO ADAMS.
AND I'M TASHA ADAMS.
AND WE'RE TWINS.
FROM DENVER, COLORADO.
Together: OUR COMPANY IS
VILLAGE SCHOLARSHIPS.
AND WE'RE HERE TODAY
SEEKING $125,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
OF OUR COMPANY.
GETTING ACCEPTED INTO COLLEGE
IS A BIG DEAL.
BUT FIGURING OUT
HOW TO PAY FOR IT...
IS AN ORDEAL.
BUT WHAT IF THERE WAS
A SOLUTION
TO SOLVE FUTURE STUDENT DEBT
THAT WAS BOTH...
VIABLE AND PROFITABLE?
YES.
WELL, THERE IS
WITH VILLAGE SCHOLARSHIPS.
IT'S WHERE MATCHMAKING MEETS
A NEW TYPE OF CROWD FUNDING
THAT FORMS HOMEMADE SCHOLARSHIPS
FUNDED BY...
PEOPLE YOU KNOW...
AND MATCHED BY...
PEOPLE WHO CARE.
ANYONE INTERESTED
IN HELPING COLLEGE STUDENTS
ACHIEVE THEIR COLLEGE DREAM CAN
CONTRIBUTE TO A COLLEGE FUND.
IT'S THAT EASY.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
STUDENTS COME TO OUR WEBSITE,
AND THEY CREATE A PROFILE.
YOU SIMPLY INPUT
YOUR INSTITUTION,
YOUR MAJOR,
AND YOUR TUITION GOAL,
AND YOU SHARE YOUR PROFILE
WITH YOUR SELECT FAMILY
OR FRIENDS
OR YOUR ENTIRE
SOCIAL NETWORK.
AFTER THE COMPLETION
OF A STUDENT'S CAMPAIGNS,
THEIR FUNDS
WILL BE DIRECTLY TRANSFERRED
TO THEIR
UNIVERSITY ACCOUNTS.
SHARKS, HELP US MAKE
A DIFFERENCE...
AND JOIN THE VILLAGE TODAY.
ISN'T IT REALLY
JUST A WAY
FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
TO GIVE SOMEBODY MONEY?
WE'RE A TRADITIONAL
CROWD-FUNDING WEBSITE,
BUT WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US IS
THE MATCHING FUND OPPORTUNITY.
SO, THE REASON PEOPLE SOLICIT
FUNDS FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS
IS REALLY TO DEVELOP
ENOUGH MONEY
SO THEY CAN MATCH A SCHOLARSHIP
FUND WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
HOW MANY USERS HAVE ACTUALLY
ENTERED THE DATA INTO THIS?
WELL,
CURRENTLY AT THIS TIME,
WE HAVE USERS
THAT ENTERED THEIR DATA,
BUT THE WEBSITE ITSELF
IS NOT COMPLETELY FINISHED,
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE --
-SO THIS IS A CONCEPT.
-YES, WE ARE JUST STARTING.
-SO, YOU'RE JUST STARTING.
IT'S A CONCEPT.
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN --
AH, IT'S A CONCEPT.
THERE WE GO.
AND YOU DON'T --
YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY MONEY YET.
NO.
ISN'T IT REALLY
JUST A WAY TO DONATE?
YES.
IT'S NOT REALLY A BUSINESS.
WELL, THEY'RE GONNA TAKE A
PERCENTAGE AT SOME POINT, RIGHT?
YES, WE'RE --
IT'S GONNA BE BASED
ON THE TRADITIONAL
SERVICE AND FEES.
WHAT'S YOUR FEE GONNA BE?
THE FEE IS 8.5%
ON THE COMPLETION
OF A STUDENT'S CAMPAIGN.
DANG!
AND THE REASON -- THAT'S
ACTUALLY STANDARD COMMISSION --
-I DON'T THINK SO.
-WOW. NO.
THAT'S THE STANDARD
COMMISSION FEE FOR
TRADITIONAL CROWD FUNDING.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
A CROWD-FUNDING SITE,
YOU KNOW, FOR, LIKE,
KICKSTARTER --
I'M AN INVESTOR IN KICKSTARTER.
IT BRINGS DISTRIBUTION
TO YOUR PROJECTS.
SO IF NOBODY'S HEARD
OF YOUR PROJECT BEFORE,
YOU PUT IT THERE,
IT GETS FEATURED.
WHAT HAPPENS HERE,
THOUGH, IS THAT
THE MAJORITY OF YOUR FUNDRAISING
IS COMING FROM PEOPLE YOU KNOW.
PEOPLE THAT ARE
EITHER FRIENDS, FAMILY,
OR MAYBE ONE DEGREE AWAY
FROM YOU.
AND SO THAT FEE THAT YOU'RE
TAKING STARTS TO FEEL HUGE,
AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY BRINGING
ANYTHING TO THE TABLE
THAT THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE.
WELL, ACTUALLY,
CURRENTLY WITH WEBSITES,
LIKE OUR MAJOR COMPETITOR
WOULD BE, LIKE, A GoFundMe,
THEY'VE, IN THE LAST
THREE YEARS ALONE, HAVE SEEN
A 4,500% INCREASE
IN RAISING --
FUNDRAISING
FOR COLLEGE TUITION ALONE.
BUT CHRIS HIT THE NAIL
ON THE HEAD.
THEY BRING PEOPLE WITH MONEY
TO PEOPLE WITHOUT MONEY.
WHAT IS THE PRIMARY COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITE?
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS SITE
IS ACTUALLY
THE MATCHING FUND ASPECT.
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THE PRIMARY ADVANTAGE IS
THAT STRANGERS WILL MATCH FUNDS.
AM I GETTING THAT RIGHT?
THE FUNDAMENTALS
OF THE WEBSITE IS
WE'LL FIRST START
WITH CROWD FUNDING.
AN INDIVIDUAL
WOULD RECRUIT FRIENDS OR FAMILY
TO THE WEBSITE
TO SOLICIT FUNDS.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD BRING
THEMSELVES.
YES.
THAT'S WHERE, ON OUR END,
WE'RE RECRUITING
AND WE'RE BUILDING OUT
A NETWORK OF INDIVIDUALS
THAT ALREADY CREATE
SCHOLARSHIPS ON THEIR OWN.
O'Leary:
SO, THIS BECOMES THEIR PLATFORM.
THEY ELECT TO USE
THIS ONE TO GIFT.
YES, AND ALLOWING PEOPLE,
INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOURSELF
OR MYSELF TO SAY,
"I WANT TO CREATE
A $5 SCHOLARSHIP
TO THIS CATEGORY SO THAT ANYONE
THAT MATCHES THESE CRITERIAS
CAN MATCH THEIR FUNDS
WITH ME."
HOW DID YOU GUYS PAY
FOR COLLEGE?
I, DURING UNDERGRAD,
RECEIVED A FULL RIDE
IN OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AT NORFOLK STATE UNIVERSITY.
AND THEN I HAVE A FELLOWSHIP
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA
FOR OPTICAL SCIENCE.
-AND WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
-VERY INTERESTING.
MY BACKGROUND IS
I'VE STARTED
THREE START-UP COMPANIES
IN MY PAST,
BUT ALSO I'M A FORMER
COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYER.
AND HOW THE IDEA CAME
TO FRUITION
IS I LOST TWO
ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS
DUE TO SEASON-ENDING
INJURIES.
YOU HAVE TO EITHER HAVE
A LOT OF DONORS
OR YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A LOT OF APPLICANTS.
BECAUSE THE VALUE TO DONORS
IS YOU HAVE A VERY LARGE
BASE OF APPLICANTS,
AND THE VALUE
TO THE APPLICANTS IS
I'M GONNA GET MONEY
BESIDES FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
I DON'T BUY
THAT THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY
ARE GONNA PAY YOU 8%
TO DONATE THE MONEY
THEY COULD GIVE YOU DIRECTLY.
THE MARKET ACTUALLY SAYS
OTHERWISE IN SOME RESPECTS.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY
ALREADY USING CROWD FUNDING,
KNOWING THAT THERE'S A FEE
ALREADY ON TOP OF IT.
LOOK, YOU CAN'T CHARGE 8.5%.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
OKAY.
I'M ALREADY INVESTED
IN HoneyFund AND PLUMFUND,
WHICH IS COMPETING WITH YOU
ON A BROADER SCALE.
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU WON'T BE SUCCESSFUL,
BUT IT MEANS I'M NOT
GOING TO INVEST IN
A COMPETITOR, OBVIOUSLY.
UNDERSTAND.
UNDERSTANDABLE.
SO, FOR THAT REASON, AND WITH
FULL RESPECT TO YOU GUYS,
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW,
I-I THINK THE IDEA HAS MERIT.
I THINK YOU GUYS SPENT A LOT
OF TIME THINKING ABOUT IT.
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE,
BUT I'M NOT CLEAR
HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.
I'M OUT.
LAST YEAR,
DAYMOND AND I INVESTED
IN THE SCHOLLY SCHOLARSHIP APP,
AND IT'S DOING REALLY WELL,
AND IT'S HELPING A LOT OF PEOPLE
GET CONNECTED WITH SCHOLARSHIPS.
THIS IS INTERESTING TO ME
BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS,
MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING THAT
INTEGRATES THE TWO TOGETHER.
BUT YOU'RE JUST
BEGINNING STAGES.
LIKE, YOU HAVEN'T STARTED YET.
SO, FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, I'M SEEING FOUR
DIFFERENT BUSINESSES PITCHED.
I'M SEEING A PLATFORM
WHERE FRIENDS AND FAMILY
CAN GIVE TO A STUDENT'S
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE,
I'M SEEING A PLATFORM WHERE
STRANGERS CAN GIVE DIRECTLY
TO A STUDENT'S EDUCATION THE WAY
THAT A GoFundMe SITE GOES,
I'M SEEING A PLATFORM
FOR SETTING UP A SCHOLARSHIP
WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL
OR FOUNDATION,
AND I'M SEEING A PLATFORM
WHERE A STUDENT CAN COME
AND FIND SCHOLARSHIPS THAT
THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR
THAT WERE SET UP
BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR FOUNDATION.
ALL FOUR OF THOSE THINGS
ARE INTERESTING IDEAS.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TACKLE
ALL FOUR OF THEM.
WITHOUT THAT KIND OF FOCUS,
I'M OUT.
I APOLOGIZE
FOR MAKING IT CONFUSING
