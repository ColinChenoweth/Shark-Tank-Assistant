I AM KING
NICHOLAS GALEKOVIC...
-[ LAUGHS ]
-...PROTECTOR OF
THE FACE FOLLICLES.
AND I AM
QUEEN ALESSIA GALEKOVIC,
THE QUEEN OF THE KINGDOM.
AND TOGETHER, WE ARE
THE FOUNDERS OF BEARD KING.
WE'RE SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% OF OUR ENTIRE KINGDOM.
SO, SHARKS,
AS LONG AS THERE'S BEEN MEN,
THERE'S BEEN FACIAL HAIR.
NOW, WHETHER THAT'S A BEARD,
MUSTACHE,
SIDEBURNS, OR ANY FACIAL HAIR
FOR THAT MATTER,
WE ALL HAVE ONE PROBLEM
IN COMMON.
THE FACT IS
GROOMING FACIAL HAIR
CAN BE A VERY MESSY
AND TIME-CONSUMING TASK.
SO, IMAGINE ALL THOSE
DISGUSTING, LITTLE HAIRS
ALL OVER YOUR SINK,
ALL OVER YOUR COUNTER,
ALL OVER YOUR SOAP,
ALL OVER YOUR TOOTHBRUSH,
EVENTUALLY CLOGGING YOUR SINK.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
GUESS WHO HAS TO CLEAN THAT UP?
ME.
-YOU SOUND EXACTLY LIKE MY WIFE.
-MM-HMM.
-THANK YOU.
-YES.
-[ LAUGHS ]
-[ LAUGHS ]
-EXACTLY.
NOW, LORD O'LEARY,
I KNOW YOU ONCE RELATED
TO THIS MADNESS
WITH YOUR ONCE-ALMIGHTY
BEARD.
Greiner: YOU HAD A BEARD?
O'Leary: OH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH!
Herjavec: THAT'S KEVIN?
NO WAY!
-THAT IS JUST
A BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING GUY.
-BEAUTIFUL.
[ LAUGHS ]
Alessia: AND, AS YOU KNOW,
WITH A GREAT BEARD
COMES
GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.
AND WE HAVE INVENTED
THE SOLUTION
FOR THIS VERY HAIRY
SITUATION.
LORDS AND LADIES,
PRESENTING THE WORLD'S FIRST
AND ONLY GROOMING TOOL
THAT ELIMINATES MANUAL CLEAN UP
AND ALLOWS FOR
AN EASY DISPOSAL.
THE BEARD BIB.
AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
YEP.
SO...
-SERIOUSLY?
-[ LAUGHS ]
YES.
ARE YOU GUYS --
ARE YOU GUYS TOGETHER?
WE'RE MARRIED.
YES, WE'RE --
YES.
OKAY. AND SO THIS COMES UP.
THIS ISN'T A HYPOTHETICAL.
-THIS IS A REAL-LIFE SITUATION.
-THIS IS HOW WE CAME UP WITH IT.
THIS IS ACTUALLY
HOW WE CAME UP WITH IT.
HE WOULD ALWAYS
MAKE A MESS.
I'M A NEAT FREAK.
I WAS JUST SICK OF IT.
RIGHT.
SO, IT WAS
A CONSTANT BATTLE.
NICK, HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY OF THESE?
-YES.
-OH, OF COURSE.
TO DATE,
WE HAVE $140,000 IN SALES
JUST IN EIGHT MONTHS.
WOW. [ CLAPPING ] YEAH.
THANK YOU.
JUST LAST MONTH,
WE DID $80,000 IN SALES.
HOW? HOW DID YOU DO $80,000
IN A SINGLE MONTH?
OUR VIDEO WENT VIRAL
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
WE HAD
OVER 20 MILLION VIEWS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SERIOUSLY.
-OUR STRENGTH --
-THAT VIDEO YOU SHOWED US?
-YES, THAT VIDEO RIGHT THERE.
-YES, IT WAS HYSTERICAL.
SO, OUR BACKGROUND
AND OUR STRENGTH, FOR ME,
IS BRAND DEVELOPMENT.
SO, I CREATE
ALL THE CONTENT,
WE DID ALL THE BRANDING,
WE DID EVERYTHING OURSELVES.
AND SO, BY WORD OF MOUTH,
PEOPLE ARE CATCHING ONTO IT,
AND EVERY DAY, IT JUST
KEEPS GROWING AND GROWING.
-IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?
WE JUST LAST MONTH
GOT OUR COSTS DOWN TO $7,
AND WE SELL IT FOR $29.
-WOW.
-GOOD MARGINS. GOOD MARGINS.
THE MARGINS ARE GOOD.
NOW --
THEY CAN GET EVEN BETTER
WITH YOUR GUYS' HELP.
THEY CAN GET --
WITH YOUR HELP, I THINK WE CAN
GET THE MARGINS TO ABOUT 85%.
CAN WE SEE THE PACKAGING?
OF COURSE.
OUR PACKAGING I LOVE,
SO YOU BETTER LOVE.
[ LAUGHS ]
WOW.
I'M SCARED
NOT TO LOVE IT.
IS THERE ANYTHING TO STOP
ANYBODY ELSE FROM MAKING THIS?
IT IS PATENT PENDING.
IT'S A PATENT
ON THE UTILITY --
AN APPARATUS ATTACHED
TO A MIRROR AROUND ONE'S NECK.
WELL, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
WHEN I FIRST SAW IT,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE,
BUT $140,000 IN SALES,
20 MILLION VIEWS,
I MEAN, YOU'RE --
YOU'RE DOING IT.
SO, WHY DO YOU NEED THE MONEY?
WE NEED THE MONEY
TO SCALE MANUFACTURING.
SEE, THAT'S OUR PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW.
WE LITERALLY CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE DEMAND.
Cuban: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU SOLD $140,000 --
-$80,000 LAST MONTH ALONE.
-YOUR MARGIN --
-RIGHT.
-CORRECT.
YOUR MARGINS ARE HUGE, RIGHT,
SO YOU'VE GOT 75% MARGINS.
Nicholas:
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.
THE FIRST SEVEN MONTHS,
OUR MARGINS WERE ONLY 40%.
OKAY.
SO, JUST RIGHT NOW,
WE GOT IT TO 75%.
SO, YOU NEED THE CASH FOR...
FOR -- FOR SCALING
MANUFACTURING.
FOR INVENTORY.
WHAT'S THE PROJECTION
FOR NEXT YEAR?
400K CONSERVATIVELY
ON THE GROWTH RATE WE'RE GOING.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GO FROM
THE CURRENT SALES TO $400,000?
HAVE YOU TALKED TO RETAILERS?
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO APPROACH
A BIG BOX STORE?
SO, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN APPROACHED
BY MANY WHOLESALE
AND DISTRIBUTORS,
LORI IS NICHOLAS AND ALESSIA'S
LAST CHANCE
FOR A DEAL FOR THEIR
BEARD-TRIMMING BIB, BEARD KING.
-LORI! LORI! LORI!
-I -- [ CHUCKLES ]
-LORI! LORI!
-BEARD QUEEN!
-COME ON.
-YOU GOT TO DO IT, LORI.
Nicholas:
LITTLE HIGHER THAN WE WANTED.
BUT --
IT WAS, YEAH.
SHE'S --
SHE'S THE PERFECT SHARK.
