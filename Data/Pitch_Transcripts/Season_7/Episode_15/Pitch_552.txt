MY NAME IS SARA MOYLAN.
AND I'M HER HUSBAND, BOB MOYLAN,
AND WE'RE FROM MICHIGAN.
I'M THE CREATOR
AND WE'RE THE FOUNDERS OF...
Both: SHEFIT.
WE'RE SEEKING
A $250,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, SHEFIT IS THE ULTIMATE
SPORTS BRA.
WE ARE THE FIRST
AND ONLY FULLY CUSTOM
ADJUSTABLE SPORTS BRA
ON THE MARKET.
YES, I SAID IT --
FULLY CUSTOM ADJUSTABLE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
PUTTING IT ON
COULD NOT BE EASIER.
SIMPLY UNZIP IT
AND PUT IT ON LIKE A JACKET.
NO NEED TO BE
A CONTORTIONIST ANYMORE.
THE SHEFIT SPORTS BRA
IS THE ONLY BRA
TO HAVE A TWO-INCH-WIDE
BUST SPAN
THAT WILL NEVER
STRETCH OUT, ROLL,
OR ALLOW YOU TO FALL OUT
THE BOTTOM AGAIN
WITH OVER 10 INCHES
OF ADJUSTABILITY
FOR YOU TO SET THE RIB FIT
THAT YOU WANT.
AND VANISH THE BOUNCE
FOR GOOD
WITH EVEN MORE
ADJUSTABILITY
FOR YOU TO SET THE VERTICAL LIFT
THAT YOU DESIRE.
SHEFIT IS THE PERFECT MIX
OF COMPRESSION AND ENCAPSULATION
SO THAT YOU'RE
ALWAYS COMFORTABLE
AND YOU NEVER
HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT DREADED
UNIBOOB AGAIN.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, SHARKS,
WHO'S READY TO BE A PART OF
THE NEXT BIG THING IN FITNESS?
YOU ARE SO NOT IN SHAPE.
WELL, HEY, YOU KNOW,
I TRY. I TRY.
IS SHE ALWAYS ON
LIKE THIS?
ON POINT.
[ LAUGHS ]
-ROBERT, THIS IS YOURS.
-SHE'S ON POINT.
Herjavec:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE BROUGHT
EACH ONE OF YOU
YOUR OWN PERSONAL
SHEFIT SPORTS BRA.
LORI, OF COURSE YOU GET PINK.
THANK YOU.
I'LL BE USING IT
AT THE GYM TONIGHT, SARA.
YES, YES, YOU BETTER.
YOU BETTER.
[ CHUCKLES ]
KEVIN, THIS IS THE PERFECT
FIT FOR YOU.
HE ACTUALLY
DOES NEED A BRA.
OKAY. DAYMOND.
AND MARK...
THANK YOU.
...THIS IS YOURS.
APPRECIATE IT.
LORI,
ISN'T IT A LITTLE THICK?
Greiner: I JUST WAS GONNA
ASK YOU THAT.
THIS DOES FEEL VERY PADDED.
Sara: YEAH.
IT IS VERY THICK.
IS THERE A REASON FOR THAT?
YEAH, SO, FIRST OFF,
I CREATED THIS
OUT OF MY OWN NEED
FOR A SPORTS BRA.
SO I'M A FITNESS
PROFESSIONAL.
I HAVE FOUR KIDS AT HOME.
-DAMN.
AND WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
WITH MY FIRST,
I WAS TRYING TO STAY IN SHAPE
AND DO ALL THE RIGHT THINGS,
AND --
-YOU HAVE FOUR KIDS?
I HAVE FOUR LITTLE GIRLS
AT HOME. ALL GIRLS.
GIRLS.
[ Chuckling ] WE BOTH DO.
THAT'S RIGHT.
SO, YOU KNOW, I WAS DOUBLING
AND TRIPLING UP ON BRAS.
I MEAN,
WHEN YOU ARE BIG-BUSTED,
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET A SPORTS BRA
THAT FITS YOU
THE WAY YOU NEED IT TO BE.
SO, ARE YOU SAYING WHEN YOU WEAR
THE TRADITIONAL ONES,
WHICH ARE, LIKE, REALLY, LIKE,
A REALLY STRETCHY NYLON...
LIKE A SPORTS BR-- YEP.
...THEY SMASH YOU.
YEAH.
SO THAT'S WHY I HAD SAID...
OKAY.
...YOU KNOW, IT GIVES YOU
COMPRESSION AND ENCAPSULATION,
WHICH GIVES YOU THE SHAPE
OF NOT HAVING THE UNIBOOB.
AND THE ZIPPER HELPS, AS WELL,
SO KIND OF --
-[ LAUGHS ] WHAT'S A UNIBOOB?
-A UNIBOOB?
-THE UNIBOOB IS THE SMUSHED --
-WHAT'S A UNIBOOB?
-THAT SMUSHED ONE-BOOB FEELING.
-ONE BOOB.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT ON
A COMPRESSION BRA
TO TRY TO COMPRESS THE BOUNCE,
IF YOU WILL,
IT SMUSHES
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
YOU STANDING THERE,
IT DOESN'T LOOK BULKY ON YOU.
-NO. MNH-MNH.
BUT IT'S SO PADDED
THAT I WOULD THINK
THAT YOU WOULD LOOK BIGGER.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE PAD
IN YOURS?
I DON'T. I TAKE THE PADS OUT.
SEE, THIS IS WHAT'S SO GREAT.
IT'S REALLY YOUR BRA,
AND YOU WEAR IT YOUR WAY.
BUT ISN'T IT UNCOMFORTABLE
BECAUSE IT'S SO THICK?
WELL,
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION.
IT'S NOT UNCOMFORTABLE.
SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY
GET THIS PRODUCT ON,
IT IS SO COMFORTABLE.
IT'S LIGHT.
ALL OF THESE
ARE WICKING FABRICS.
IS THERE ANY OTHER BRA
OUT THERE
THAT ZIPS FROM THE FRONT
LIKE THIS?
IS THIS STANDARD?
-YES, A MILLION.
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
THERE ARE SPORTS BRAS
THAT ZIP FROM THE FRONT.
HOWEVER, WE HAVE A PATENT
ON OUR ADJUSTABILITY.
IT'S A UTILITY PATENT.
-ON WHICH ADJUSTABILITY PART?
Bob: BOTH OF THEM.
ON THE SHOULDER STRAP
AND THE BUST-BAND COMPONENT.
-THE TWO TOGETHER?
-THE TWO TOGETHER.
IT'S A VERY STRONG PATENT.
NOBODY ELSE HAS THIS TYPE
OF TECHNOLOGY.
NOBODY IS GIVING YOU --
YOU MEAN THE MULTIPLE
ADJUSTMENT TECHNOLOGY?
ABSOLUTELY. NO, AND NOBODY HAS
IT THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING IT.
BUT LET'S GET PAST THAT.
YES.
BECAUSE THE PROOF IS IN
THE MARKET AND IN YOUR SALES.
EXACTLY.
SO TALK NUMBERS.
WE'VE DONE $220,000 IN SALES
IN 18 MONTHS,
$50,000 OF WHICH HAS BEEN DONE
IN THE LAST 45 DAYS.
$25,000 OF IT WAS FROM
OUR E-COMMERCE STORE.
MM-HMM.
THE OTHER $25,000,
WE OPENED UP 19 RETAILERS.
IS IT ONE CHAIN?
-NO.
-NO. MULTIPLE.
-WHAT TYPE OF RETAILERS?
OKAY, LET ME -- CAN I?
THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ]
SO, BECAUSE THAT'S ONLINE --
[ IMITATES ENGINE CHUGGING ]
I WONDER WHO DOES THE TALKING
IN THE FAMILY.
I KNOW.
HE CAN NEVER GET A WORD IN.
-WE'LL LET YOU TALK AGAIN, BOB.
-WELL, WAIT. LET'S CLARIFY.
INSTEAD OF INSULTING HER,
LET'S CLARIFY SOMETHING.
I'M NOT INSULTING HER.
WELL, YOU'RE SAYING
SHE DOES ALL THE TALKING.
MAYBE THERE'S A REASON.
-I THINK SHE DOES.
John:
SHE JUST DID ALL THE TALKING!
[ Chuckling ]
SHE DOES DO ALL THE TALKING.
MAYBE THERE'S A REASON
SHE DOES ALL THE TALKING.
Sara: SO --
WHAT IS YOUR ROLE?
WHAT IS HER ROLE?
I'M -- I'M ALL CREATIVE,
ENGINEERING, SALES.
BOB IS MORE THE LOGISTICS
AND FINANCIAL.
I DO THE -- I DO MANUFACTURING,
WORKING WITH
OUR OVERSEAS VENDORS.
DO YOU DO THIS FULL-TIME?
WE HAVE SALES JOBS BY DAY.
AND SO -- JUST TO BACK UP
A LITTLE BIT --
WHAT KIND OF SALES
DO YOU DO?
SO I DO MED-DEVICE SALES. I --
I'M INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS.
-AND YOU HAVE FOUR KIDS.
-AND I HAVE FOUR KIDS.
-AND YOU HAVE THIS BUSINESS.
-AND YOU BOTH WORK OUT
LIKE CRAZY.
THAT'S CLEAR.
-WE DO, YES.
YOU HAVE TO, CHASING AROUND
A BUNCH OF KIDS
AND HAVING A WIFE
THAT'S SUPERWOMAN OVER HERE.
YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.
BOB AND I HAVE BEEN
VERY SUCCESSFUL
AT OUR DAILY SALES JOBS.
BUT BECAUSE OF THAT SUCCESS
HAS COME A TON OF FREEDOM.
AND I'M WALKING AWAY
IN LESS THAN 90 DAYS.
'CAUSE N--
YOU'RE WALKING AWAY
IN LESS THAN 90 DAYS?
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE GONNA GO FULL-TIME?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHY DO YOU NEED A SHARK?
WHY DO YOU NEED $250,000?
THE BULK OF THE MONEY,
ABOUT 70%,
IS GOING TO BE
TO FUND OUR INVENTORY.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
WE NEED TO SHORTEN OUR LEAD TIME
AND INCREASE
OUR SUPPLIER RELIABILITY.
WE NEED TO ENHANCE
OUR FRONT END, RIGHT?
FRONT END?
FOR OUR WEBSITE.
SURE.
FOR OUR WEBSITE.
WE HAVE SUCH AN AVERAGE
FRONT END.
THAT'S BEEN ONE
OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES,
IS WE CAN'T GET A WEB TEAM
TO GET THINGS RIGHT.
RIGHT.
SO THE AMOUNT OF SALES
THAT WE'VE DONE, YOU GUYS,
I JUST NEED TO BACK UP
AND TELL YOU,
HAVE COME LITERALLY
FROM WORD OF MOUTH,
GRASSROOTS MARKETING,
ME HUSTLING,
PICKING UP THE PHONE,
GOING TO TRADE SHOWS, AND...
FACEBOOK ADS.
...FACEBOOK ADS.
THAT'S IT.
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE?
THAT BRA RIGHT THERE
IS $14.50.
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
$58.99.
$58.99.
-$58.99.
-THAT'S A GREAT MARGIN.
NOW, HERE'S THE THING, THOUGH --
75%.
LISTEN TO THIS, THOUGH.
THIS IS THE THING.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE WERE PAYING --
WE WERE PAYING --
I BET YOU HEAR THAT
ALL THE TIME.
"LISTEN TO THIS, THOUGH."
SHE'S GONNA HIT ME
IN A SECOND PROBABLY.
I KNOW.
WELL, WE WERE PAYING --
WE WERE PAYING
ALMOST $40 A BRA
TO MAKE 'EM HERE IN L.A.
THEY COULDN'T KEEP UP
WITH THE DEMAND.
WE WERE SELLING OUT
WHEN WE GOT THEM IN.
YOU GUYS,
THIS IS A $3 BILLION INDUSTRY.
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GET
INTO THE ACTIVEWEAR SPACE.
ACTIVEWEAR FOR WOMEN
IS A $15.7 BILLION INDUSTRY.
WE'RE GOING OUTSIDE OF THAT PIE
AND WE'RE CREATING OUR OWN PIE.
THIS DOESN'T EXIST
RIGHT NOW.
BUT YOU'RE NOT CREATING
YOUR OWN PIE.
NO.
CUSTOMIZ--
CUSTOMIZABLE SPORTS BRAS
DO NOT EXIST.
BUT YOU'RE NOT, SARA.
SARA, YOU'RE --
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE GOING AFTER
THE SPORTS-BRA INDUSTRY.
BUT CUSTOMIZABLE.
THEY'RE OUT THERE.
YOU'RE DOING IT BETTER, MAYBE.
DOING IT MUCH BETTER.
EXACTLY.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
OUTSIDE OF THE PIE.
WELL, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
THOUGH, ROBERT,
AND I DON'T MEAN
TO CHALLENGE YOU,
BUT EVERYONE'S DOING
"ADJUSTABLE" SPORTS BRAS.
IN TERMS OF ADJUSTABILITY,
IT'S LIMITED.
WE ARE CUSTOMIZING -- THIS IS
A CUSTOMIZABLE SPORTS BRA.
NOBODY ELSE ALLOWS YOU
TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR OWN FIT
HERE AND HERE.
LOOK, THE POINT -- YOU GUYS
CAN ARGUE ALL DAY LONG.
SPORTS BRAS --
THE PROOF IS IN THE SALES.
-EXACTLY.
PROOF IS IN THE SALES,
THAT'S RIGHT.
EXACTLY.
WE'VE DONE -- WE'VE DONE $50,000
IN THE LAST 45 DAYS.
WE HAVE 200 ONLINE REVIEWS
OF WOMEN,
WE AVERAGE 4 1/2 STARS
BECAUSE THEY LOVE IT.
SO, FIRST OF ALL,
I ADMIRE THE DISCIPLINE
TO HAVE FOUR KIDS
AND TO BE
IN THIS INCREDIBLE SHAPE.
I MEAN, HEALTHY BODY,
HEALTHY MIND, RIGHT?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
BUT WHEN YOU START TALKING
ABOUT YOU'RE GONNA CREATE
A BRAND-NEW CATEGORY
OF WOMEN'S WEAR,
YOU LOSE ME THERE.
I'M OUT.
AND THAT'S A FAIR --
THAT'S FAIR.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
ADJUSTABILITY,
IN TERMS OF SETTING
YOUR OWN SUPPORT,
DOES NOT EXIST.
AND THE SPORTS-BRA CATEGORY
IS HUGE.
I JUST NEED SOME DOORS
TO BE OPENED.
GET ME IN FRONT
OF THE RIGHT PERSON,
AND I'LL SELL THESE BRAS
ALL DAY LONG.
I BELIEVE THAT.
LIKE,
THIS IS A BIG THING.
OUR RETAILERS --
RETAILERS HAVE TO STOCK
ANYWHERE FROM 12 TO 14 BRAS
PER CUP SIZE.
32, 34, 36, "A," "B,"
"C," "D," AND SO ON.
"B," "C," "D," "E," "F."
OUR BRA,
BECAUSE OF THE ADJUSTABILITY,
CAN GO FROM,
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS...
AND THEY STOCK SEVEN SIZES.
...TO THIS.
SO NOW WE'VE DRAMATICALLY CUT
THEIR SKUs IN HALF.
AND I'LL TELL YOU --
-OKAY, THAT'S INTERESTING.
YOU'RE REDUCING THE SKU COUNT.
-ABSOLUTELY ARE.
AND THE AMOUNT OF INVENTORY
THEY HAVE TO HOUSE.
AND I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
THINKING ABOUT,
"WHAT HAVE I SEEN OUT THERE
ON THE MARKET?"
SO YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN THINGS
THAT HELP YOU WITH YOUR POSTURE.
YEAH, I'VE SEEN THEM.
THEY ADJUST HERE, RIGHT?
THEY BRACE ACROSS YOUR BACK.
-THEY BRACE IN THE BACK.
THEY CRISS-CROSS ON YOUR BACK
AND THEY HELP YOU TO KEEP
YOUR SHOULDERS BACK.
YEP, AND THEY --
THE ONLY MISSING FEATURE IS,
IS THEY DON'T COME ACROSS HERE.
WELL, THAT'S A BIG DEAL, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHS ]
-IT'S A HUGE DEAL.
-WELL, BUT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
BECAUSE IN PATENTING,
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING
THAT IS PRIOR ART,
WHICH I WOULD IMAGINE
YOU MUST HAVE FILED THAT.
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,
THEN AN EXAMINER
MIGHT LOOK AT IT AND SAY,
"WELL, IT WAS INTUITIVE THAT YOU
WOULD PUT THIS INTO A --"
Cuban: YEAH, BUT SOMEONE'S
GONNA CHALLENGE YOU...
-"YOU WOULD PUT
THIS INTO A BRA."
-...AND GO THROUGH A WHOLE --
Greiner:
SO THAT CONCERNS ME.
AND I'M NOT SAYING
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A PATENT
OR YOU'LL LOSE YOUR PATENT.
I'M JUST SAYING
FOR ME AS AN INVESTOR,
BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE
OTHER THINGS OUT THERE
THAT MIGHT BECOME PROBLEMATIC,
I'M OUT.
THAT'S FINE.
AND WE RESPECT THAT, LORI.
THANK YOU, LORI.
WE DO.
WE APPRECIATE THAT.
HOWEVER, WITH APPAREL,
DAYMOND,
YOU KNOW TO GET A PATENT
ON APPAREL IS VERY HARD.
YEAH, SO, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAY
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA CREATE
ANYTHING NEW
IN THIS WORLD AGAIN.
YOU KNOW, TWITTER WAS A NOTE
ON A PIGEON'S LEG
A MILLION YEARS AGO.
I DIDN'T CREATE ANYTHING NEW
WITH A T-SHIRT.
RIGHT.
I HAVE SPEED TO MARKET.
I FOUND A NEW AREA
THAT WAS BEING NEGLECTED.
MM-HMM.
I THINK I CAN ADD VALUE
WITH SPEED TO MARKET.
I-I REPRESENT JILLIAN MICHAELS
FOR INTERNATIONAL LICENSING
AND A LOT OF THESE INFLUENCERS.
-MM-HMM.
SO I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOT.
BUT YOUR VALUATION
IS A LITTLE HIGH.
YOU WANT $250,000 FOR 20%.
I WANT TO BE 1/3 PARTNER.
$250,000 FOR 33.33%.
-OKAY.
THAT'S A LITTLE RICH,
ISN'T IT?
BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
THE ANSWER NOW.
THIS GUY IS ASKING
FOR 1/3 OF YOUR BUSINESS.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GIVE UP
ALL THE EQUITY --
GUYS, I NEED THAT ANSWER
RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE I LOVE
DECISIVE PARTNERS.
Sara: WE GOT A DEAL
WITH DAYMOND JOHN,
AND THIS ALLOWS SHEFIT
TO JUST RUN FASTER THAN EVER...
EXPLODE.
...AND EXPLODE
WITH JUST CRAZY SPEED.
WE'RE SO EXCITED.

NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A MODERN VERSION
OF A COMMON ACCESSORY.
