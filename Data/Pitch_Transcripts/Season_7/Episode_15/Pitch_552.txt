WELL, HELLO THERE, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JEFF POPP.
AND I'M CASEY LORENZEN.
WE'RE FROM DENVER,
COLORADO,
AND WE'RE THE FOUNDERS
OF CO.ALITION.
WE'RE HERE SEEKING
A $200,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR 20% EQUITY
OF OUR COMPANY.
NOW, SHARKS,
WE LIVE IN AN AGE
WHERE EVERYONE
IS CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE
AND TOTALLY ADDICTED
TO THEIR TECHNOLOGY.
WHEN YOUR PHONE DIES,
IT'S LIKE THE WORST
THING IN THE WORLD
AND YOU'RE LEFT SCRAMBLING,
TRYING TO PLUG YOUR PHONE
INTO AN OUTLET.
WELL, NOT ANYMORE!
'CAUSE CO.ALITION BACKPACKS
ARE THE SOLUTION.
WE GIVE YOU BRAINS
AND BEAUTY
BY INTEGRATING SMART TECHNOLOGY
INTO ELEGANTLY DESIGNED BAGS.
WITH OUR BAGS,
YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR DEVICES
RUNNING OUT OF MEMORY, DYING,
OR LOOKING LIKE A DORK.
WITH OUR SYSTEM, YOU SIMPLY
PLUG YOUR DEVICE INTO YOUR PACK,
AND YOU HAVE CHARGING WITH YOU
EVERYWHERE YOU GO.
[ CELLPHONE CHIMES ]
-UGH!
-[ LAUGHS ]
-OH, I'M OUT.
-[ WHISTLES ]
-OH, THAT'S IT, I'M OUT.
-SWEET.
WHEN IT'S TIME
TO RECHARGE YOUR BAG,
YOU DON'T NEED TO
REMOVE ANYTHING.
JUST PULL THE CORD OUT AND PLUG
THE PACK DIRECTLY INTO THE WALL.
NOW, WE KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE READY TO START THROWING
YOUR MONEY AT US,
BUT JUST KEEP YOUR PANTS ON
'CAUSE THIS PARTY
IS JUST GETTING STARTED.
WHAT REALLY SETS
THESE PACKS APART
IS THE INTEGRATED
WIRELESS HARD DRIVE.
WITH THIS, YOU CAN STORE
THOUSANDS OF DIGITAL FILES
SUCH AS MOVIES, MUSIC,
AND DOCUMENTS.
IT'S LIKE A PERSONAL
CLOUD SERVICE
THAT GOES EVERYWHERE
YOU DO
AND KEEPS LARGE FILES
OFF YOUR DEVICES
BUT WIRELESSLY ACCESSIBLE
AT ALL TIMES.
NOW, DON'T BE INTIMIDATED
BY OUR BOYISH GOOD LOOKS,
BRUTE STRENGTH,
OR PRISON TATS.
THE FACT IS, WE HAVE THE PASSION
AND DETERMINATION
TO MAKE THIS
INTO A GREAT SUCCESS.
NOW, WHO'S GONNA HELP US ADVANCE
THE EVOLUTION OF CARRY?
WE HAVE A COUPLE BAGS RIGHT HERE
YOU GUYS CAN CHECK OUT.
AND THEY'RE WIRED UP
WITH CORDS.
TEST IT OUT.
Greiner: THANK YOU.
[ CELLPHONE CHIMES ]
SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN DOING THIS?
OH, COOL.
WE STARTED THIS BUSINESS
ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS AGO,
BUT WE HAVE BEEN
IN THE PACK INDUSTRY
FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS.
Lorenzen: WE HAVE AN EXISTING
PACK COMPANY.
IT'S AN OUTDOOR TECHNICAL BRAND
CALLED MHM.
DOES THAT COMPANY
STILL EXIST?
THAT COMPANY DOES STILL EXIST.
IT DOES, YEAH.
HOW BIG IS IT?
LAST YEAR'S SALES
WERE $450,000.
IN TOTAL, WE'VE DONE
$1.2 MILLION WITH THAT BRAND.
YEAH.
AND IS IT A DESIGNED PACK?
I'M ASSUMING
IT'S NOT SMART PACK.
IT'S NOT.
IT'S -- NO.
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
INDUSTRY.
WE MADE THIS A SEPARATE BRAND
BECAUSE WE WANTED --
IT WAS A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT CUSTOMER.
AND WE WANTED TO REACH
ON THE OTHER SIDE.
SO I'M INVESTING ONLY IN THIS,
NOT THE OTHER COMPANY.
-JUST FOR CO.ALITION.
-WE SET THAT UP FOR CO.ALITION.
IS THERE ANYTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT IT? DO YOU HAVE A PATENT?
NO, THERE IS NO PATENT ON THIS.
THERE IS NO PATENT, NO.
SO, BASICALLY, ANYBODY CAN PUT
A CHARGER AND A DRIVE IN A BAG.
Cuban: YEAH, THERE'S PLENTY OF
PORTABLE DRIVES THAT ARE SMALL,
THAT HAVE WIFI BUILT IN, THAT
YOU CAN ATTACH TO A CHARGER.
John:
WELL, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
THERE'S PLENTY OF BAGS
THAT HAVE A SOLAR POWER ON THEM
SO YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO PLUG THEM IN.
O'Leary: SO...
WELL --
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
NOTHING?
NO, THE DIFFERENCE IS
OUR CHARGING SYSTEM
IS ACTUALLY COMPUTERIZED.
A LOT OF THESE OTHER MOBILE
BATTERIES YOU FIND AREN'T.
WHAT'S UNIQUE?
SO, IT ACTUALLY HAS
A COMPUTER CHIP IN IT
THAT REGULATES
POWERING OUT OF THE BAG.
THE DIFFERENCE IS, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO REMOVE OUR SYSTEM.
THOSE OTHER SYSTEMS, RESEARCH
SHOWS PEOPLE USE THEM AT FIRST
AND THEN GRADUALLY
STOP USING THEM.
GUYS, HAVE YOU SOLD
ANY OF THESE YET?
YEAH, WE'VE SOLD
ALMOST 500 BAGS IN 7 MONTHS.
SO, HOW MUCH DO EACH ONE
OF THESE BAGS COST?
IT RANGES ANYWHERE
FROM $180 TO $600 RETAIL.
Herjavec:
AND WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?
OUR PROFIT RANGE
IS ANYWHERE FROM 50% TO 70%.
-SO, JEFF, YOU'VE SOLD 500 BAGS.
-YES.
WHAT WAS YOUR TOTAL REVENUE
ON THAT?
OUR TOTAL REVENUE
IS ABOUT $100,000.
AND HOW DO PEOPLE FIND YOU?
YOU KNOW, WE'RE MAINLY SET UP
TO BE DIRECT SALES ONLINE.
-SO IT'S ALL ONLINE.
-YEAH.
YEAH,
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY MONEY
TO PUT INTO MARKETING
OR ADVERTISING.
ALL OF THAT
HAS BEEN WORD OF MOUTH.
BUT WHAT'S THE VISION?
BESIDES --
VISION IS WHAT WE BRING
TO THE TABLE.
NO, NO, BUT HOW DO YOU SEE IT
BECOMING BIG?
HOW DO YOU --
BECAUSE THIS IS A --
THIS IS A GLOBAL PRODUCT.
WE ACTUALLY GOT THE IDEA
WHEN WE WERE IN JAPAN
ON A BUSINESS TRIP.
WE WERE ON A TRAIN,
AND WE NOTICED EVERY
SINGLE PERSON WE SAW
HAD A MOBILE DEVICE
OF SOME SORT AND A BAG.
AND THIS WORKS ACROSS THE BOARD
FOR PEOPLE TO USE.
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU.
I MEAN,
I KNOW WHAT THE GUYS ARE SAYING.
YOU CAN GO BUY ALL THAT STUFF.
BUT PEOPLE ARE LAZY.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT.
YEAH, IT'S NOT INTEGRATED WELL.
I LOVE THE CONVENIENCE.
I PLUG MY PHONE IN.
I'M GOOD TO GO.
MM-HMM.
HERE'S YOU TODAY --
REALLY, REALLY TINY.
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT
REALLY BIG?
WHAT'S THE --
WHAT'S THE GO-TO-MARKET PLAN?
I-I FEEL LIKE THIS PRODUCT ISN'T
BEST FOR TRADITIONAL RETAIL.
BECAUSE
IT'S SO DEMONSTRABLE,
IT'S HARD TO GET RETAIL STAFF
TO BE ABLE TO REALLY --
SO YOU'RE GONNA PUMP MONEY
INTO GOING ONLINE.
YEAH.
DIRECT SALES.
YEAH, WE REALLY WANT
TO OPTIMIZE OUR WEBSITE.
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE STEPPING INTO AN ARENA
WHERE EVERYONE'S BEEN IN
BUSINESS FOR, LIKE, 30 YEARS.
SO --
AND IT'S A COMMODITY.
YEAH, IT'S A VERY -- YEAH.
AND IN A PRETTY NICHE MARKET.
IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET.
YEAH, YEAH.
SO, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF OUR
DESIGN, WE HAVE A FRESH OUTLOOK.
WE'RE MUCH YOUNGER,
HAVE A DIFFERENT VISION
THAN ALL THESE COMPANIES
THAT WILL LOSE THEIR LUSTER
OVER TIME.
BUT NOW
EVERY ONE OF US HERE
CAN GO PICK UP
A COUPLE OF BAGS THEY LIKE
AND SAY TO A PRIVATE LABELER,
"COPY THIS BAG,"
AND THEN THEY CAN HIRE FIVE KIDS
AT $50,000 A YEAR...
MM-HMM.
...WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING
ON SOCIAL MEDIA
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
AND THEY CAN PRODUCE
THESE BAGS.
ALL THOSE ARE TRUE WORDS,
ACTUALLY.
YEAH, SO WHY WOULD YOU
VALUE THIS AT $1 MILLION?
I THINK 'CAUSE WE'RE PIONEERING
A MARKET HERE.
LIKE, WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY
IS EXPLODING.
GUYS, LET ME ASK
A DIFFERENT QUESTION.
IF YOU'RE SO GOOD
WITH YOUR OTHER COMPANY --
YOU'VE GROWN IT
TO $450,000 IN SALES --
WHY TAKE AWAY
ANY ATTENTION FROM IT?
THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.
-RIGHT.
-RIGHT?
-BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A NICHE --
I MEAN,
IF YOU'RE THAT GOOD, GRIND.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW,
GET THAT FIRST COMPANY, MHM,
UP TO $1 MILLION, $2 MILLION,
$5 MILLION.
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU
FROM GETTING THERE?
BECAUSE WE SEE
THE GLOBAL POSSIBILITY
WITH THIS BRAND
MORE SO THAN MHM.
SEE,
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
IT'S LIKE,
"LET'S CREATE A NEW BRAND.
LET'S GO ON 'SHARK TANK.'
AND, OH, BY THE WAY,
WE HAVE THIS OTHER COMPANY."
I MEAN, I JUST --
IF YOU GUYS WERE GOOD,
IT WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN
ONE COMPANY.
HERE'S A NEW PRODUCT, AND
WE'RE GONNA GO TO NEW HEIGHTS.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
JEFF, YOU KNOW, I --
THIS IS NOT A SEPARATE COMPANY,
TO MARK'S POINT.
THIS IS A FEATURE
TO YOUR EXISTING COMPANY.
YOU'RE $450,000
COMPETING AGAINST
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR PLAYERS,
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA STOP ONE
AND START ANOTHER?
I MEAN, IT MAKES --
WE'RE NOT STOPPING --
OH, BUT COME ON. IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.
I THINK EVEN YOU GUYS
KNOW THAT HERE.
BUT -- BUT THE LOOK --
WHETHER YOU'RE TRYING
TO BE COY, OR...
I MEAN, THE AESTHETIC,
EVERYTHING IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THAN OUR --
NO, IT'S A FEATURE.
I'M OUT.
O'Leary:
OKAY, JEFF AND CASEY,
YOU HAVE THREE SHARKS
STILL IN THE DEAL.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO REBOOT
AT THIS POINT?
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS RIDICULOUS.
YOU BIFURCATED
THE OTHER HALF OF SALES
AND DIDN'T BRING IT INTO
THE TANK, WHICH WAS STUPID.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW?
I'M GIVING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY
TO REBOOT.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER IDEA
YOU'D LIKE TO PRESENT
BEFORE WE THROW YOU
OUT OF HERE?
AND EVERYONE QUESTIONS
JEFF AND CASEY'S DECISION
TO ONLY OFFER THE SHARKS A STAKE
IN THEIR LESS-PROVEN
BACKPACK LINE, CO.ALITION,
AND NOT THEIR ENTIRE COMPANY,
WHICH INCLUDES
A MORE LUCRATIVE BAG LINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS RIDICULOUS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW?
I'M GIVING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY
TO REBOOT.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER IDEA
YOU'D LIKE TO PRESENT
BEFORE WE THROW YOU
OUT OF HERE?
