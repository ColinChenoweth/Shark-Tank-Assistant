HI, SHARKS.
I'M JASON SHAKLEFORD,
VICE PRESIDENT OF SALES
AND MARKETING FOR ICY BREEZE.
AND MY NAME'S ANDREW JENKINS,
THE C.E.O.
AND I'M DAVE YONCE,
THE OWNER AND INVENTOR
OF THE ICY BREEZE.
TODAY,
WE'RE HERE SEEKING $50,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 5% OF OUR COMPANY.
ICY BREEZE
IS TRULY REVOLUTIONIZING
THE WAY PEOPLE DEAL
WITH THE HEAT.
WE ALL KNOW
THAT BEING HOT IS NO FUN.
AND NOW, THANKS TO ICY BREEZE,
IT IS UNNECESSARY.
ICY BREEZE
IS THE WORLD'S FIRST
PERSONAL,
PORTABLE AIR CONDITIONER
AND COOLER ALL IN ONE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
AIR-CONDITIONING IS NO LONGER
JUST FOR INDOOR USE ONLY.
BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING
AIR-CONDITIONING INTO
THE GREAT OUTDOORS.
AND WE DO IT
WITH THE ICY BREEZE.
WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE
THE ICE-COLD WATER
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TUB,
WE PUMP THAT WATER UP INTO
THIS BRASS RADIATOR IN THE LID.
THE COLD WATER
CHILLS THE RADIATOR.
THERE'S A THREE-SPEED FAN
ALSO BUILT INTO THE LID
ON THE BACK SIDE.
THAT FAN
PULLS THE AIR OUT
AND BLOWS OUT
THROUGH THE FLEXI-HOSE
ON YOU, THE SUBJECT,
35 DEGREES BELOW
THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE.
I'LL TELL YOU, SHARKS,
ONE OF THE THINGS
WE ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT
IS NOT ONLY IS IT PORTABLE,
BUT IT'S WIRELESS.
THERE'S A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
BUILT INTO THE LID
THAT PROVIDES UP TO SIX HOURS
OF COOLING RELIEF.
THE APPLICATIONS
FOR THE ICY BREEZE ARE ENDLESS.
IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO KEEP
JUNIOR COOL INSIDE THE DUGOUT
AND KEEPING MOM AND DAD COOL
IN THE STANDS IN THE BLEACHERS.
THERE ARE SO MANY
APPLICATIONS --
ICY BREEZE IS THE SOLUTION
TO BEATING THE HEAT.
O'Leary: SO, DOES THIS
MELT THE ICE FASTER
BECAUSE IT'S PUTTING
HOT AIR AGAINST IT,
IT'S RECIRCULATING?
IT DOES MELT THE ICE
A LITTLE BIT FASTER,
BUT THE LARGER CHUNK OF ICE,
THE LONGER IT'S GONNA LAST.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
RETAIL FOR THIS JEWEL
RIGHT HERE...
[ LAUGHS ]
...IS $349 JUST LIKE THIS.
-OOH-WHEE!
-WHOA!
-THAT INCLUDES --
-IS THAT ALL?
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE
ON COMFORT.
WELL, YOU DID -- $349.
YES, WE DID.
SO, IF I JUST BOUGHT
A REGULAR COOLER,
I THINK I COULD GET ONE
FOR ABOUT $39 TO $59.
I'VE GOT TO PAY ANOTHER $300
FOR THAT JEWEL?
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU BOUGHT A CAR WITHOUT
AIR-CONDITIONING?
Cuban: YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE THREE,
FOUR, FIVE FRIENDS,
FAMILY IN THE HOT SUN IN TEXAS?
HOW'S IT GONNA KEEP
FIVE PEOPLE COLD?
-WE WANT TO SELL FIVE OF 'EM.
-NO. NO KIDDING, RIGHT?
JASON, WHY DOES IT
COST SO MUCH MORE?
BABY, YOU'RE A GREAT SALES GUY.
-IS THERE
A COST-OF-GOODS REASON?
-NO, ABSOLUTELY.
-THERE IS A COST OF GOODS.
-THERE IS A COST OF GOODS.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE IT?
IT COSTS $191 TO MAKE IT.
-OH, SO IT'S EXPENSIVE
TO MANUFACTURE.
-WHOA.
-WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE?
-WHOA.
-THAT'S NOT COOL.
-BECAUSE WE HAVE
A 10 AMP-HOUR
NICKEL METAL HYDRIDE BATTERY
BUILT INTO THE LID.
-WE ALL KNOW
BATTERIES ARE EXPENSIVE.
-SO THE BATTERY IS THE COST?
Cuban:
SO, HOW ARE YOU SELLING THESE?
-THE FAN, THE BRASS RADIATOR.
-YOUR MARGINS ARE HORRIBLE.
WE SELL THEM MAINLY ONLINE.
WELL,
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
WE'VE SOLD 1,700 UNITS SO FAR.
YEAH.
IN ADDITION
TO SELLING ONLINE,
WE'RE ALSO IN 48 SAM'S CLUBS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES LAST YEAR,
IN REVENUE, IN DOLLARS?
$125,000.
AND WHAT WILL YOU SELL
THIS YEAR?
THIS YEAR,
WE'RE PROJECTING $2.5 MILLION.
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU SUNK
INTO THE COMPANY ALREADY?
$5.5 MILLION.
-OOH.
-OH!
-OH.
WHY DID IT COST
$5.5 MILLION?
WE UNDERSTAND
THAT THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY.
BUT --
-OH, IT DOES.
<i>-SEEMS</i> LIKE A LOT OF MONEY?
IT <i>IS</i> A LOT OF MONEY.
HOW DID YOU RAISE
THE $5.5 MILLION?
WHAT DID YOU PUT INTO IT?
I-I JUST PUT IT IN MYSELF.
IT'S MY MONEY.
-HOW DID YOU
MAKE ALL THAT MONEY?
-YOU HAD $5.5 MILLION TO PUT IN?
I'M A SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR.
I'VE BEEN AN ENTREPRENEUR
SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.
MY BROTHER AND I STARTED
A SOFTWARE COMPANY.
Herjavec: WHICH ONE?
SolarWinds.
YOU -- YOU STARTED SolarWinds?
YEAH.
-NO WAY!
-YOU KNOW ABOUT SolarWinds?
OH, VERY WELL.
THANKS.
YOU JUST GOT ACQUIRED,
LIKE...
SO WE STARTED THAT IN '98,
AND IT'S JUST GONE GREAT.
AND I GOT TO RING THE BELL
ON THE NEW YORK
STOCK EXCHANGE IN 2009.
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO INVENT THINGS.
I'M COMING AFTER YOU.
I'VE GOT 30-SOMETHING PATENTS.
[ LAUGHS ]
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS?
ONE NIGHT,
I WAS CAMPING WITH MY SON.
IT WAS 95 DEGREES
AT MIDNIGHT.
I'M MISERABLE.
HE'S MISERABLE.
AND OUR COOLER IS SITTING THERE
WITH DRINKS.
AND I'M LIKE, "AH, IF I COULD
JUST CRAWL INSIDE THAT THING,
IT WOULD FEEL SO GOOD."
SO WE OPEN IT UP
AND WE'RE TAKING ICE CUBES
AND RUBBING IT
ON OURSELVES.
I'M LIKE,
"THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
THAT I CAN COOL AIR
WITH THIS."
DIDN'T HE JUST SAY, "DAD,
SHOULDN'T WE NOT CAMP
WHEN IT'S GONNA BE 95 DEGREES
AT NIGHT?"
OH, WE'RE OUTDOORS PEOPLE.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
I REALLY --
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP.
-I MEAN, I'M --
-BULL CRAP.
NOT BUYING IT.
BULL CRAP.
WHY $50,000?
BECAUSE IF I CAME UP
WITH THIS HIGH EVALUATION,
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE OFFENSIVE.
BECAUSE I REALLY AM AFTER
A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST GO
AND HIRE SOMEBODY?
I MEAN, ALL OF US UP HERE
ARE AS GOOD
AS THE TEAM
THAT WE HAVE AROUND US.
WE COULD DO THAT.
WE COULD DO THAT.
WELL, THEN WHY
DON'T YOU DO THAT?
BUT IT'S CLEAR IN AMERICA
THAT THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE
THAT HAVE THE BEST CONNECTIONS.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER.
Cuban: LOOK, DAVE,
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE, RIGHT?
I'VE FUNDED
PASSION PROJECTS MYSELF.
AND REALLY,
YOU'RE BLESSED LIKE I AM
WHERE IT'S NOT
ABOUT HOW BIG THE CHECK IS.
RIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT
ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING
AND THEN JUST PROVING
YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.
YEAH. AND PEOPLE
THAT ACTUALLY WORK HARD.
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS ONCE
YOU'VE GOTTEN THAT BIG CHECK,
IS YOU LOSE SOME OF
THE PISS AND VINEGAR, RIGHT?
IT'S LIKE I HAD
A SEMI-LONG-TERM GIRLFRIEND,
AND SHE SAID,
"IT'S ME OR YOUR COMPANY,"
AND MY RESPONSE WAS,
"WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?"
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE ALL-IN. YOU'RE FOCUSED.
YOU'RE DRIVEN.
ONCE YOU GET
THAT BIG CHECK,
EVEN THOUGH YOU THINK YOU CAN
RECAPTURE IT ALL THE TIME,
IT'S HARD,
BECAUSE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE,
I WANT THE ENTREPRENEUR
TO HAVE THAT UNLIMITED DRIVE.
AND I THINK YOUR WING MEN
PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF IT.
BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A SHORTCUT HERE FROM ME
FOR YOU TO GET THERE.
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Herjavec: DAVE,
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE AS DRIVEN
TODAY AS YOU WERE BEFORE?
I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER BE AS DRIVEN,
BUT I DO IT
IN 10 DIFFERENT WAYS NOW.
ALL OF MY BUSINESSES
ARE CASH-FLOW-POSITIVE.
ALL OF THEM ARE A SUCCESS.
I MEAN, I JUST -- I LOVE IT.
WE ARE STABLE.
WE ARE CASH-FLOW-POSITIVE.
THE RISK IS GONE.
I THINK -- WELL, NO,
THE RISK IS NOT GONE.
NO, NOT GONE.
I THINK, DAVE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S THE TIME THAT IT TAKES
TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED
BECAUSE THAT TIME
I'M TAKING AWAY
FROM ONE OF
MY EXISTING BUSINESSES.
YOU DON'T NEED US.
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE,
YOU WILL BE TOTALLY FINE.
AND I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
TO HELP ANOTHER GUY WHO --
YOU MAY EVEN BE
MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN ME.
I HAVE NO IDEA.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
SO, DAVE, I DON'T THINK
PEOPLE IN AMERICA
ARE GONNA EMBRACE
A $400 COOLER WITH ICE IN IT
AS AN AIR CONDITIONER,
SO I'M OUT.
YOU -- YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT
AN OUTDOORSY PERSON.
I AM AN OUTDOORSY PERSON,
BUT I LIKE A MINT ON MY PILLOW
EVERY NIGHT.
YEAH. DAVE,
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
WE HAVE A SEGMENT
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
PORTABLE,
PERSONAL AIR-CONDITIONING
DOESN'T EXIST TODAY.
WE ARE IT.
DAVE,
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE.
YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER BUILT
THIS COOLER FOR $350
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE KIND OF MONEY YOU HAVE.
WE WANT IT TO BE NOT JUST
A GREAT AIR CONDITIONER,
BUT WE WANT IT TO BE
ONE OF THE BEST COOLERS.
THERE'S NO WAY
THIS IS GONNA SELL
ON A WIDE SCALE FOR 350 BUCKS.
I JUST THINK THE PRICE POINT
IS TOO HIGH.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LOWER IT.
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR JOURNEY.
I'M OUT.
LISTEN, IT'S A CLEVER SOLUTION
TO THE HEAT,
BUT THE ONE THING I WORRY ABOUT
IT IS, IT BLASTS AT ONE PERSON.
WE FIND FAMILIES
AT THE BALL FIELDS USING IT
WHERE THEY SIT
AND THEY BLOW IT THIS WAY,
AND TWO OR THREE PEOPLE
ARE ENJOYING --
BUT IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE.
BUT RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE PAYING
$349 RIGHT AND LEFT FOR IT.
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH HISTORY YET.
BECAUSE
IT'S A BRAND-NEW PRODUCT.
IT'S A BRAND-NEW MARKET.
YOU'RE INVENTIVE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF THE POPULATION
CAN AFFORD TO BUY THAT
TO BRING WITH THEM.
I THINK IT'S A CLEVER SOLUTION,
BUT I'M OUT.
-THANKS, GUYS.
-WE'RE ALL OUT.
THANKS.
APPRECIATE IT.
-GOOD LUCK. KEEP CREATING.
-YOU GUYS TAKE CARE.
