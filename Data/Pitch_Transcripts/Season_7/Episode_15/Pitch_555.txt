MY NAME IS SHAAN PATEL,
AND I'M FROM LAS VEGAS, NEVADA.
TODAY, LET'S START OUT
WITH THIS SIMPLE PROBLEM.
I'VE DEVELOPED
AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM
THAT HELPS STUDENTS
ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS
WHETHER IT'S GETTING INTO
THE COLLEGE THEY WANT TO,
THE SCHOLARSHIPS THEY WANT TO,
AND JUST BE THE BEST
THAT THEY CAN BE.
MY PARENTS GREW UP VERY POOR
IN GUJARAT, INDIA,
AND THEY IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA
WITH JUST $65 IN THEIR POCKETS.
THROUGH HARD WORK,
THEY WERE ABLE TO
SAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO OPEN A BUDGET MOTEL.
THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP.
HI, MOM. HI, DAD.
MY PARENTS INSTILLED IN ME
THE VALUE OF EDUCATION.
BECAUSE OF MY HARD WORK,
I ENDED UP GETTING
A FULL-RIDE SCHOLARSHIP
TO THE UNIVERSITY
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
WHERE I'M CURRENTLY
GETTING MY MEDICAL DEGREE.
AT THE SAME TIME,
I'M DOING MY MBA AT YALE.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WELCOME TO CLASS TODAY.
NOW I NEED A SHARK
TO HELP ME TAKE MY BUSINESS
TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL.
WITH THE SHARK'S INVESTMENT,
I BELIEVE I CAN HELP
MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ACHIEVE
SUCCESS JUST LIKE I HAVE.
IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO SUCCEED
BECAUSE MY PARENTS
HAVE INVESTED SO MUCH IN ME,
AND I WANT TO MAKE THEM PROUD.
MY SUCCESS
IS THEIR AMERICAN DREAM.
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS SHAAN PATEL.
I'M FROM LAS VEGAS, NEVADA,
AND I'M SEEKING $250,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY,
2400 EXPERT S.A.T. PREP.
SO, WE ALL KNOW MEN LIE,
WOMEN LIE, BUT NUMBERS DON'T.
SO LET ME GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS.
SINCE 2005, 14 MILLION STUDENTS
HAVE TAKEN THE S.A.T.
AND ONLY 3,000 HAVE GOTTEN
A PERFECT 2400.
THAT'S JUST .02%.
AND I HAPPEN TO BE
ONE OF THOSE 3,000.
SO I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING,
"OH, YOU'RE JUST SOME GENIUS.
HOW CAN YOU HELP
OTHER STUDENTS?"
BUT I AM BY NO MEANS A GENIUS.
ACTUALLY, THE FIRST TIME
I TOOK THE S.A.T. EXAM,
I ONLY SCORED AROUND AVERAGE.
BUT AFTER DILIGENTLY
SELF-STUDYING FOR THIS TEST,
I WAS ABLE TO RAISE MY SCORE
640 POINTS TO A PERFECT 2400.
NOW, I'M SHARING
MY TEST-PREP SECRETS
TO HELP OTHER STUDENTS PREPARE
THE WAY I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL.
MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN
ADMITTED TO IVY-LEAGUE SCHOOLS,
HAVE WON MILLIONS
IN COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS,
AND SOME HAVE EVEN GOTTEN
PERFECT S.A.T. SCORES
THEMSELVES.
NOW, 2400 EXPERT IS LOOKING
TO EXPAND ACROSS THE NATION.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY TO
SCORE BIG OFF MY PERFECT SCORE?
WOW.
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
TELL US HOW IT WORKS.
IT'S A SIX-WEEK COURSE.
AND UP UNTIL
JUST ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN-PERSON,
CLASSROOM-STYLE IN LAS VEGAS.
WE JUST STARTED OFFERING
ONLINE COURSES SIX MONTHS AGO.
THOSE ARE ACTUALLY
STARTING TO BRING IN
MORE REVENUE THAN EVEN
THE IN-PERSON COURSES.
WHAT'S THE REVENUE TODAY?
SO, WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS,
AND WE'VE DONE
$1.2 MILLION IN SALES.
WOW.
THAT'S IN
THE TOTAL PERIOD, RIGHT?
THAT'S IN THE TOTAL PERIOD,
BUT WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING
ABOUT THAT IS
PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR,
WE'VE DOUBLED REVENUE,
SO ABOUT HALF OF
THAT $1.2 MILLION
CAME JUST LAST YEAR,
BASED ON LAS VEGAS
IN-PERSON COURSES.
SO, SHAAN, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.
YEAH?
I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT
THE TEST-PREP MARKET.
OKAY.
I WAS A SHAREHOLDER IN KAPLAN
AND THE PRINCETON REVIEW.
THERE WE GO. YEAH.
BOTH OF THEM.
TELL ME, WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO ACQUIRE A STUDENT?
SO, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
WE DON'T HAVE GREAT ANALYTICS
ON THE CUSTOMER-ACQUISITION
COST.
BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU
IS PRETTY MUCH
ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS
COME FROM WORD OF MOUTH,
SO IT'S PARENTS AND STUDENTS
WHO HAVE HEARD
ABOUT OUR SCORE IMPROVEMENTS.
I GET THAT
FOR THE LAS VEGAS MARKET.
YEAH.
BUT IF YOU
WANT TO SCALE THIS
AND COMPETE WITH THE BIG BOYS
IN TEST PREP,
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THEY SPEND ALL THEIR TIME DOING.
YES.
NO, NO, I AGREE WITH YOU.
AND WE'RE DEFINITELY
WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW.
SHAAN,
WHAT DOES THE COURSE COST?
SO, THE IN-PERSON COURSE
COSTS --
FOR A 60-HOUR COURSE
COSTS $999.
SO, THAT COMES OUT
TO ABOUT $17 PER HOUR.
AND WHAT IS THE COST
ONLINE?
ONLINE, IT'S $599
FOR THOSE 60 HOURS,
SO UNDER $10 AN HOUR.
SO, ON THE 600,000 SALES
LAST YEAR,
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU MAKE?
WE MADE ABOUT $220,000.
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT
IS ONLINE CURRICULUM?
WE JUST STARTED
6 MONTHS AGO ONLINE,
SO ABOUT 40%
IS NOW BRINGING ONLINE.
SO NOW WE HAVE STUDENTS
ENROLLING
FROM CHINA, INDIA, LONDON --
AND IS ONLINE LIVE?
WILL YOU STILL HAVE
AN INSTRUCTOR,
OR IS ONLINE RECORDED
AND PACKAGED?
YEAH, SO I'M PRETTY MUCH
THE FACE OF THE COMPANY.
AND A LOT OF STUDENTS
WANT TO TAKE COURSES WITH ME,
SO I TEACH ONE COURSE A WEEK
FOR ONLINE.
SO I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT MY BACKGROUND.
SURE.
I'M CURRENTLY AN MD/MBA STUDENT
AT BOTH U.S.C. AND YALE.
WOW.
AND THE REASON
THAT I AM WHERE I AM TODAY
IS REALLY BECAUSE
OF MY S.A.T. SCORE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
MY S.A.T. SCORE CHANGED MY LIFE.
I GREW UP
IN MY PARENTS' BUDGET MOTEL.
I WENT TO URBAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS
IN THE WORST SCHOOL DISTRICT
IN THE NATION.
BUT BECAUSE OF MY S.A.T. SCORE,
I WAS ADMITTED
INTO PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES.
I RECEIVED $500,000
IN SCHOLARSHIP OFFERS.
I EVEN GOT TO MEET THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
O'Leary:
WHY DOES 2400 EXPERT
GET THE INCREMENTAL STUDENT
THAT'S NEVER HEARD OF YOU?
WE HAVE AN AVERAGE
S.A.T. SCORE IMPROVEMENT
THAT'S INDUSTRY-LEADING --
376 POINTS IN 6 WEEKS.
THAT'S COMPARED
TO OUR COMPETITORS,
WHO GET 50 TO 100.
SO, THE PRODUCT'S GOOD
IS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME.
BUT HOW DO I LET THE --
THE PRODUCT'S GREAT, YEAH.
HOW DO I LET THE WORLD KNOW
THAT YOU EVEN EXIST?
BECAUSE THE WHOLE STRATEGY
OF THE S.A.T. MARKET
IS CUSTOMER ACQUISITION --
IT'S THE WHOLE DEAL.
OR, BETTER YET, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA USE THE MONEY FOR?
YES, SO,
THE MONEY IS GONNA BE USED
TO OPEN A DOZEN NEW LOCATIONS.
SO THE MARKETS
THAT I'VE SELECTED ARE NEW YORK,
LOS ANGELES, SAN FRANCISCO,
WASHINGTON D.C., PHILADELPHIA,
AND BOSTON.
BUT NOW YOUR ONLINE OPERATION
IS YOU TEACHING LIVE.
THAT'S ONE. WE COULD ALWAYS HAVE
OTHER INSTRUCTORS TEACHING LIVE.
BUT WE HAVE ALSO
ENROLLED STUDENTS.
OKAY, BUT DOES IT NEED
TO BE LIVE ALL THE TIME?
WHAT'S THAT?
OR COULD IT BE
PACKAGED CONTENT?
-OH, SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
-RIGHT.
EVERYONE -- SO, OUR CUSTOMER
IS NOT THE HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT.
IT'S THE HIGH-SCHOOL PARENT.
AND PARENTS DO NOT WANT
THE PRE-RECORDED ONLINE COURSE
FOR THEIR HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT
IN GENERAL.
I'M CURRENTLY IN THE ONLINE
EDUCATIONAL SPACE.
NOW, YOU BROUGHT UP
A VERY GOOD POINT --
THE PARENTS ARE BUYING IT
AND MAKING SURE
THAT THE KIDS THEMSELVES
TAKE IT,
BUT THEY DON'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE GONNA GO AND SIT DOWN
IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER
EVERY DAY.
YEAH.
BUT I DON'T SEE THE SCALABILITY
IN REGARDS TO WHERE
I CAN HELP YOU WITH MY MODEL.
MM-HMM.
I CAN'T TAKE THIS RIDE WITH YOU,
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
APPRECIATE THAT.
DO YOU WANT TO
BE A DOCTOR?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR.
OR AN ENTREPRENEUR?
UH, THIS -- LOOK.
I'VE -- SO I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN IN SCHOOL.
I'VE ALWAYS -- SO, THAT'S A --
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN SCHOOL,
BUT I'VE ALSO ALWAYS
BEEN AN ENTRE--
SHAAN, I THINK YOU'RE DIGGING
YOURSELF A HOLE HERE.
BECAUSE AN INVESTOR,
A SHARK INVESTOR,
WANTS TO HEAR
THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY COMMITTED
TO DOMINATING
THE TEST-PREP SPACE.
YEAH.
AND IT HAS TO BE OOZING
FROM EVERY PORE.
WE HAVE TO BELIEVE IT.
SHAAN'S COMMITMENT
TO HIS BUSINESS, 2400 EXPERT,
AN S.A.T. PREP COURSE.
DO YOU WANT TO
BE A DOCTOR?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR.
OR AN ENTREPRENEUR?
UH, THIS -- LOOK.
YOU CAN'T BE
A PART-TIME ENTREPRENEUR.
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY
DRIVING THE BUSINESS.
AND YOU HAVEN'T
ARTICULATED
A STRATEGY
FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION.
OKAY. SO I'LL GIVE YOU --
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXACT STRATEGY.
SO, YES, I'M IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.
I REALIZED IN MEDICAL SCHOOL
THAT MY BUSINESS WAS TAKING OFF.
WE BARELY HAD ENOUGH STUDENTS
FOR THE FIRST COURSE.
WHAT I'M DOING IS FOCUSING
ON MY BUSINESS TO SCALE IT.
I'M TAKING AN EXTENDED SUMMER
JUST TO FOCUS ON MY BUSINESS.
I THINK THAT THE ELECTRONIC
CONTENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
I UNDERSTAND YOU SAY
THAT PEOPLE WON'T SIT AND DO IT,
BUT I THINK
THAT IF YOU HAVE PARENTS
AND YOU'RE A STUDENT
THAT REALLY CARES,
EVEN IF JUST
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE STICK,
AND YOU CAN SELL A LOT
OF THE ELECTRONIC CONTENT,
THEN THAT'S THE WAY
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
DRIVE THIS BUSINESS.
BUT I -- YOU KNOW, ENTREPRENEUR,
DOCTOR, YOU'RE NOT SURE.
I DON'T SEE ME GIVING YOU
THE MONEY TO SUPPORT THIS.
I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHICH
DIRECTION YOU WANT TO BE.
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANKS.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
OKAY. UM,
LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT IT.
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MENTION
THAT I WOULD BE OPEN, KEVIN,
TO A LICENSING DEAL
WITH PRINCETON REVIEW OR KAPLAN.
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD
BE INTERESTING TO ANY SHARK.
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY DO THAT.
THEY FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT
ABOUT THEIR CONTENT.
YEAH, NO, OF COURSE.
I WAS JUST THROWING IT OUT.
Herjavec:
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I THINK YOU COULD SELL
A LOT OF IT.
BUT MY CHALLENGE WITH IT IS
YOU'RE KIND OF PLAYING AT IT.
YOU WANT TO BE A DOCTOR,
AND YOU WANT TO BE
AN ENTREPRENEUR.
AND THEN WHEN KEVIN ASKED YOU,
YOU SAID,
"OH, I'D ALSO BE INTERESTED
IN MAYBE LICENSING IT."
YOU KNOW, BUSINESS ISN'T THAT.
YOU CAN'T PLAY AT BUSINESS.
WELL, I --
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
COME ACROSS A GUY
WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO BE A DOCTOR,
AND HE IS GOING TO
KICK YOUR BEHIND.
I CAN'T INVEST
IN A PART-TIME ENTREPRENEUR.
I'M OUT.
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS MARKET
THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS,
IT'S RECESSION-PROOF.
YEAH.
AND IT'S HUGE.
YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM, SHAAN,
IS YOU'RE NOT 110% COMMITTED.
THE QUALITY OF ENTREPRENEUR
THAT GETS ON THAT CARPET
HAS TO BE SO COMMITTED
BEFORE THEY GET A CHECK
FROM A SHARK.
MM-HMM.
I GIVE MY MONEY TO PEOPLE THAT
WILL DIE FOR THEIR BUSINESS.
THEY'LL GIVE UP
THEIR LIVES FOR IT.
THAT'S THE KIND OF GENERAL
I WANT TO BACK.
YOU'RE NOT
THAT KIND OF GENERAL.
I'M OUT.
Cuban:
UM, LOOK, REALLY, WHERE DO
YOU WANT TO BE IN 10 YEARS?
THAT'S THE QUESTION.
BECAUSE YOU WILL GET BORED
WITH THIS.
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS BE
A $20 MILLION REVENUE BUSINESS.
BUT MY DREAM IS ALSO,
I WOULD LOVE
TO BE A DERMATOLOGIST
OR OPHTHALMOLOGIST
WHO WORKS TWICE A WEEK.
[ LAUGHS ]
I BELIEVE I'M THE
HARDEST-WORKING PERSON I KNOW
OTHER THAN MY FATHER.
MY FATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY
WITH, LIKE, $65.
HE WORKED FROM 5:00 A.M.
TO 11:00 P.M.,
SPLITTING HIS TIME
BETWEEN A PHARMACY,
GAS STATION, AND MOTEL.
AND I GOT MY WORK ETHIC
FROM HIM. I'VE WORKED --
LOOK, ONE OF THE BEAUTIES
OF "SHARK TANK" --
AND PEOPLE -- THESE GUYS
ALWAYS GIVE ME A HARD TIME
WHEN I DO THIS...
YEAH.
...IS YOU GET TO ACQUI-HIRE
ALL THE TIME,
WHERE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,
YOU'RE BETTING
ON THE BRAINS IN THE COMPANY.
YEAH.
SO I LIKE OPPORTUNITIES
LIKE THIS.
BUT I HAVE QUESTIONS,
ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.
SO, WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, THEN,
IS IF YOU PIVOT...
YEAH.
THAT WHATEVER YOU GO IN,
EXCLUSIVE OF MEDICINE, RIGHT,
THIS ALL BECOMES
PART OF THE RIDE.
OF COURSE.
THIS IS ALWAYS PART OF THE RIDE.
THIS IS MY MAIN THING.
IT'S MY BABY.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
BUT IF YOUR BABY EXPANDS
AND YOU HAVE OTHER CHILDREN...
YEAH.
I WANT -- I WANT TO BE THE
GODPARENT TO THOSE CHILDREN.
YOU WOULD OF COURSE
BE THE GODPARENT.
SO WHAT I'LL DO IS
I'LL OFFER YOU THE $250K
FOR 20%.
UM...I-I THINK
THAT CONTINGENCY'S FINE.
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A COUNTEROFFER.
OH.
15%, SO MEET IN HALFWAY THERE,
$300,000.
NO.
OH.
NOT --
NO, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
GONNA BE THE GUY,
THE BIGGEST NEED YOU HAVE
IS INFRASTRUCTURE...
YEAH.
...AND TAKING OFF
ALL THE ADMINISTRIVIA.
IT'S, UH...
COULD WE DO $300,000 FOR 20%?
NOPE.
OH!
YOU KEEP DROPPING YOU PISTOL
WHEN YOU JUMP
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
YOU CAME IN
AT $250,000 FOR 10%.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?
-WAIT, NO --
-NOW YOU'RE GOING $300,000 --
ALL RIGHT,
I TAKE YOUR OFFER, MARK.
DONE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
-THANKS.
-THANK YOU.
-APPRECIATE IT.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
-YES, WE WILL.
THANKS. APPRECIATE IT.
IMPRESSIVE.
YES, YES!
OH, YES.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
MARK CUBAN
IS MY BUSINESS PARTNER.
THAT'S -- THAT'S PRETTY COOL.
