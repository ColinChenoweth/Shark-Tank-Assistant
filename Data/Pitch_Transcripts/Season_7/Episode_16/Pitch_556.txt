I'M LISA BRADLEY.
AND I'M CAMERON CRUSE.
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF R. RIVETER.
CAMERON AND I ARE BOTH
MILITARY SPOUSES.
WE MET WHEN
WE WERE IN GEORGIA
WHILE OUR HUSBANDS WERE
STATIONED WITH THE ARMY.
BEING A MILITARY SPOUSE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.
YOU MOVE ON AVERAGE
EVERY 2.9 YEARS,
WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO FIND A JOB
OR BUILD A RÈSUMÈ
TO BE PROUD OF.
-HEY, GUYS.
-HEY.
-GOOD MORNING.
A BIG PURPOSE BEHIND OUR COMPANY
IS EMPOWERING WOMEN.
AND ACTUALLY WE NAMED OUR
COMPANY AFTER ROSIE THE RIVETER.
SHE'S A WORLD WAR II ICON
THAT ENCOURAGED WOMEN
TO GO BACK
INTO THE WORKFORCE
WHILE OUR MEN WERE SENT OFF
TO BATTLE.
HER MOTTO IS,
"WE CAN DO IT,"
AND THAT'S HOW WE FEEL
ABOUT OUR BUSINESS, TOO.
WE'RE SO EXCITED
TO GET THIS OUT TO YOU.
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GROW
AND SCALE THIS COMPANY
BY OURSELVES.
BUT WE ARE
AT A TURNING POINT,
WHERE WE NEED
NOT ONLY CAPITAL
BUT EXPERTISE TO GET US
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
GETTING A DEAL
FROM THE SHARKS
MEANS THAT WE'D BE ABLE
TO SECURE THOSE JOBS
AND VALIDATE THEIR HARD WORK
AND DEDICATION TO THIS COUNTRY.
HI. I'M CAMERON CRUSE.
AND I'M LISA BRADLEY.
AND WE'RE THE CO-FOUNDERS
OF R. RIVETER,
A HANDBAG COMPANY
ON A MISSION.
WE ARE HERE
SEEKING $100,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
AS MILITARY SPOUSES,
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ASPECTS
IS UNCERTAINTY.
WHETHER THAT MEANS A DEPLOYMENT
OR RELOCATION,
THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE JUST
OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.
BECAUSE OF THIS, WE HAVE SET OUT
ON A MISSION
TO EMPOWER AND CREATE MOBILE
INCOME FOR MILITARY SPOUSES.
OUR HANDBAGS ARE MADE FROM
UPCYCLED MILITARY MATERIALS
LIKE WOOL BLANKETS,
UNIFORMS, AND TENTS.
EACH R. RIVETER HANDBAG
TELLS A STORY.
LEATHER AND CANVAS IS CUT,
LINERS ARE SEWN
ALL AT THE HANDS OF OUR NATION'S
MILITARY SPOUSES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
R. RIVETER IS ABOUT
EMPOWERING MILITARY SPOUSES
AND REDEFINING THE BOUNDARIES
OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING.
SO, SHARKS, WHO WILL HELP US
GROW THIS COMPANY
DEDICATED TO SERVING THE
FAMILIES WHO SERVE US ALL?
WE'VE GOT SOME BAGS
WE'D LIKE TO PASS OUT.
ROBERT,
WE'LL START WITH YOU.
THAT IS
THE FINCH MESSENGER.
15 MILITARY SPOUSES WENT
INTO MAKING THAT BAG.
THANK YOU.
LORI,
THE MRS. OTTO FOR YOU.
THAT BAG TRAVELED
OVER 3,000 MILES
ON ITS HANDMADE JOURNEY.
THANK YOU.
KEVIN AND DAYMOND, YOU GET TWO
OF OUR BESTSELLERS,
THE FINCH AND THE PATTON,
BOTH MADE FROM AN UPCYCLED
MILITARY TENT.
AND, MARK, YOURS IS MADE
FROM THE DRESS BLUE PANT
OF A FIRST LIEUTENANT
IN THE ARMY.
THAT'S COOL.
SO, CAMERON, YOU SAID 15 PEOPLE
WENT INTO MAKING THIS.
Cruse: YES. SO, MILITARY SPOUSES
MOVE ON EVERY 2.9 YEARS,
AND THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO FIND EMPLOYMENT,
PUT DOWN ROOTS, AND HAVE
A COMMUNITY TO BE A PART OF.
SO, WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE'VE
PROVIDED THE MOBILE EMPLOYMENT.
SO, MILITARY SPOUSES
MAKE THE PARTS AND PIECES.
LIKE THE "SUPPORT" TAG WAS DYED
IN COLORADO,
THE LEATHER WAS CUT
IN GEORGIA,
AND THE LINER WAS MADE
IN NEW YORK, AT FORT DRUM.
ALL THOSE PIECES COME TOGETHER
IN OUR SHOP IN NORTH CAROLINA,
JUST OUTSIDE
OF FORT BRAGG.
SO THEY ALL MAKE PARTS,
THEY SHIP IT TO YOU...
AND WE ASSEMBLE AND READY
FOR RETAIL.
AND SO WHAT'S THE TOTAL COST
OF THIS BAG,
FOR YOU TO MAKE IT,
WITH EVERYTHING IN?
$55 FOR THAT MRS. FINCH,
AND WE SELL IT FOR $220.
AND WHERE DO YOU TRACK
THE STORY?
SO IF I WANTED TO KNOW
THE STORY OF MY BAG...
ALL OF THE PARTS AND PIECES
MADE BY EACH MILITARY SPOUSE
ARE ACTUALLY STAMPED
WITH THEIR I.D.
Bradley: YOU CAN GO AROUND,
AND YOU CAN FIND
THE INDIVIDUAL STAMP
OF EVERY MILITARY SPOUSE
THAT PUT TIME AND EFFORT
INTO YOUR HANDBAG.
Herjavec:
AND SO I GUESS ONE RIVETER
WOULD HAVE MADE PORTIONS
OF EVERY BAG.
CORRECT.
IS THAT RIGHT?
Bradley: EXACTLY. RIGHT.
EACH VENDOR STARTS
WITH HER PART,
IN WHATEVER
SHE'S PROFICIENT IN,
AND SHE TAKES HER JOB WITH HER
WHEREVER SHE GOES.
SO THAT JOB IS GONNA
TRANSFER EVERYWHERE.
IS IT MOSTLY MILITARY PERSONNEL
BUYING THEM?
A LOT OF IT IS.
RIGHT NOW OUR TARGET MARKET
CONSISTS LARGELY OF
THE MILITARY SUPPORTER,
BUT SOMEBODY
WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS
THAT THE POWER OF THEIR DOLLAR
IS INVESTING IN A COMMUNITY.
HOW -- HOW ARE YOU -- HOW ARE
YOU REACHING OUT TO THEM?
HOW THEY BUYING THEM?
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SELLING
60% ONLINE
AND 40% IN OUR
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORE.
CAMERON, WHAT ARE THE SALES?
ALMOST $300,000
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS,
$190,000 YEAR TO DATE.
WOW. THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
IF WE GET AN INVESTMENT,
WE'RE EXPECTING $400,000
THIS YEAR.
WHY? WHAT WILL
THE INVESTMENT DO
TO ACTUALLY CHANGE YOUR SALES
BY 25%?
WE BELIEVE THAT,
WITH AN INVESTMENT,
WE CAN ACTUALLY PUT MONEY
INTO MARKETING.
WE'VE ONLY PUT
$2,000 IN EACH.
MY DAD PUT $5,000 IN.
OTHER THAN THAT, WE'VE GROWN
THE COMPANY DOLLAR BY DOLLAR.
SO YOU'VE INVESTED A TOTAL
OF $9,000.
YES.
WOW.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec:
LISA, TELL US YOUR STORY.
TELL US YOUR BACKGROUND.
TELL US HOW YOU GOT TOGETHER.
WELL,
WHEN I MET MY HUSBAND,
IT WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING
OF THE END OF MY CAREER.
I ACTUALLY MADE FOUR
CROSS-COUNTRY MOVES
BY THE TIME I WAS 24.
WOW.
I DID GO
TO BUSINESS SCHOOL,
BUT I DIDN'T GET TO START
MY CAREER.
WE ACTUALLY MOVED TO GEORGIA,
AND THAT'S WHERE I MET CAMERON.
OUR HUSBANDS WERE
RANGER INSTRUCTORS.
YOUR HUSBANDS ARE RANGERS?
YES.
WOW. VERY IMPRESSIVE.
AND THEN I HAVE A MASTER'S
IN ARCHITECTURE.
GUYS, MOST --
MOST OF YOUR SALES --
60% OF YOUR SALES ARE ONLINE,
RIGHT?
YES.
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
SO, TELL US ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE,
INCREASING YOUR TRAFFIC.
SO, ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SAYING
THAT THEY'RE FINDING US
FROM SOME KIND OF NEWS MEDIA
THAT WE'VE GOTTEN
OR WORD OF MOUTH.
SO, HUGE, UNTAPPED MARKET
FOR US ONLINE.
WE SEE A HUGE
POTENTIAL THERE,
AND PART OF THE INVESTMENT
TODAY WOULD BE
TO HOPEFULLY GO TOWARDS THAT
AND -- AND GROW THAT.
ARE YOU GETTING ANY PUSHBACK
ON THE PRICE OF THESE BAGS?
'CAUSE THEY ARE
PREMIUM-PRICED.
I THINK OUR TARGET MARKET
UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT MEANS
TO MAKE SOMETHING IN AMERICA
AND SELL IT
AND BE ABLE TO MAKE MONEY
AND HELP MORE MILITARY SPOUSES.
SO, DO YOU
SEND THEM TEMPLATES?
YES.
FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE,
"THIS MAKES THIS BAG."
DO THEY HAVE A BOOK OF ALL
THE DIFFERENT STYLES?
THEY DO.
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
SO, WE TELL THEM HOW WE ACCEPT
THE PIECES,
WHAT WE'RE GONNA BUY
FROM THEM,
AND THEY MAKE IT
TO OUR STANDARD.
I THINK THE BEAUTIFUL
THING ABOUT OUR HANDBAGS
IS THE SIMPLICITY OF THEM.
A MILITARY SPOUSE
CAN COME IN
WITH NO SEWING EXPERIENCE
AND LEARN HOW.
Cuban: WHAT'S REALLY, REALLY
COOL TO ME IS,
YOU ARE A SOCIAL NETWORK
THROUGH ACTION, RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU COULD BE LITERALLY
THE FUTURE OF --
OF MANUFACTURING,
IN SOME RESPECTS,
FOR SPECIALTY MANUFACTURING.
EVERYBODY WHO CONTRIBUTES HAS
PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP, RIGHT?
SO THEY BECOME A SALES REP
WITHOUT HAVING TO ACTUALLY
SELL THE BAG, RIGHT?
"I HELPED BUILD THIS," RIGHT?
YEAH.
WHEN YOU START GETTING
THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION,
IT COULD TAKE IT
TO A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL.
Herjavec:
I LOVE THE BUSINESS.
I GET A SENSE THAT THIS IS MORE
THAN JUST A BUSINESS FOR YOU.
THIS COMPANY IS SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST A PRODUCT.
WE'RE STANDING UP HERE
FOR EVERY MILITARY SPOUSE
THAT'S EVER HAD A DREAM.
AND SO HAVE A LOT RIDING
ON OUR SHOULDERS.
SO, TODAY WE JUST WANTED TO COME
HERE AND TELL OUR STORY
AND -- AND TELL YOU
THAT MILITARY SPOUSES --
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE
WEARING THE UNIFORM,
THEY'RE SERVING
IN THEIR OWN WAY.
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE AT
HOME, MAKING SURE THAT THEY --
THAT THE SOLDIERS HAVE A FAMILY
TO COME HOME TO.
YOU KNOW, IT'S EXTREME COURAGE
AND SACRIFICE
TO BE A MILITARY WIFE.
SOMETIMES IT IS.
WHY DO YOU FEEL
YOU NEED A PARTNER?
I THINK THAT YOU GUYS
ARE REALLY ONTO SOMETHING.
MANUFACTURING, MAKING AND
RETAILING IN THE UNITED STATES,
IS -- IT'S GONNA BE
A HARD BUSINESS.
I THINK WE NEED
A STRATEGIC PARTNER
AND SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP US
GET TO THAT LEVEL
WHERE WE CAN INCREASE
THE DEMAND STEADILY.
IF I GAVE YOU THE MONEY,
TELL ME HOW YOU WOULD SPEND IT.
WE COULD START IMMEDIATELY
WITH BASIC ONLINE STRATEGIES,
LIKE PAY-PER-CLICK ADVERTISING,
CONTENT MARKETING,
JUST BASICS.
SCALING THE COMPANY SMARTLY
IS PARAMOUNT.
WE PLANNED OUT FOR,
IF WE SOLD $1 MILLION,
THAT WE COULD FULFILL THAT
WITH 30 OPERATORS
IN THE NEW SPACE
THAT WE HAVE.
IT WOULD TAKE US THREE MONTHS
OF PRODUCTION.
OKAY. SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE --
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LEAD TIME --
THAT'S A PROBLEM.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SAY THAT
IT'S A 90-DAY LEAD TIME TO GET
YOUR PRODUCT TO DELIVER.
BUT I DON'T THINK IN THIS CASE
THAT'S A PROBLEM, MARK.
THE 90 DAYS WOULD BE BECAUSE
WE NEED TO HIRE PEOPLE.
IT'S JUST HIRING THE PEOPLE,
TRAINING THEM UP,
AND STARTING PRODUCTION.
WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU END UP
MAKING MONEY,
YOU BELIEVE THAT MAYBE
SOMEBODY ELSE
CAN DO SOMETHING BETTER
THAN YOU CAN.
AND YOU GO IN,
OFFER SOMEBODY 1/3 POTENTIALLY
OF YOUR COMPANY.
THEN YOU FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE
NO BETTER THAN YOU
AND THEY DON'T KNOW YOUR
BUSINESS AS WELL AS YOU DO.
AND NOW YOU'VE GIVEN
THAT PERCENTAGE
TO SOMEBODY ELSE
THAT DIDN'T EARN IT.
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I WOULD ADD VALUE.
PURELY JUST MONEY --
YOU JUST DON'T NEED THAT.
YOU'RE MAKING IT.
SO I THINK THAT YOU CAN DO THIS
WITHOUT ME.
AT THIS STAGE,
FOR AN INVESTMENT,
IT'S NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST,
SO I'M OUT.
Narrator:
ONE SHARK IS OUT.
LISA AND CAMERON
HAVE FOUR MORE CHANCES
FOR A DEAL FOR THEIR COMPANY,
R. RIVETER --
A BAG LINE MADE BY
MILITARY SPOUSES.
I LIKE IT.
IT FITS KIND OF WHAT I'M DOING
IN TWO OTHER BUSINESSES.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000.
YOU WANTED 10 --
YOU WANT TO SELL 10%?
-20%.
-20%.
O'Leary: UM, OKAY.
BUT I-I DON'T WANT --
HE JUST WANTS TO GIVE YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR.
I DON'T WANT TO PART-- I DON'T
WANT TO PARTNER WITH ANYBODY.
THAT'S IT.
I KNOW IT HAS TO BE DONE.
OUT OF RESPECT
FOR THE OTHER SHARKS,
CAN WE HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY?
I-I LOVE THE STORY.
MORE SO, I LOVE THE PRODUCT
AND I LOVE THE BUSINESS.
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER --
$100,000 FOR 20%,
SAME OFFER THAT KEVIN MADE.
Cuban: I'M HAPPY TO MAKE
AN OFFER, AS WELL.
I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR $100,000
FOR 20%, RIGHT?
BUT WHAT I'LL ALSO DO IS PROVIDE
WHATEVER CREDIT YOU NEED
FOR THE INVENTORY.
AND IF WE NEED
EXTRA EQUIPMENT,
I HAVE NO PROBLEM PROVIDING
THE CREDIT FOR THAT.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
UM, WELL...
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OFFERS.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD DO WHAT YOU DO.
MY MOTTO --
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE IS
I MAKE THINGS FOR MASS,
RIGHT?
YOU'RE DOING A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT MODEL
THAN WHAT I'M USED TO.
I ADMIRE AND RESPECT IT,
AND I THINK IT'S GREAT.
I WISH YOU LUCK,
BUT I'M OUT.
John: LORI AND I ARE BOTH OUT
FOR THE SAME REASONS.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD
TELL ALL THREE OF THESE BOBOS
TO TAKE A WALK AND KEEP THE REST
OF YOUR COMPANY,
AND YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
THAT'S USEFUL.
John: BUT NOW YOU HAVE
THREE OFFERS.
OKAY.
MARK, YOU HAVE A DEAL.
AH!
YES!
-[ CHUCKLES ]
-GOOD.
GOOD TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU, LISA.
THANK YOU.
-GOOD JOB, LADIES.
-THANK YOU GUYS.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
Grenier: CONGRATULATIONS.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GREAT.
THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.
THEY DIDN'T NEED THE HELP.
DAYMOND...
THEY DID.
...IF THEY WALKED OUT BECAUSE
THE REST OF US SAID NO,
YOU WOULD HAVE RUN DOWN,
GRABBED THEM, AND SAID,
"I'LL HELP YOU."
SO?
I'M JUST SAYING.
Grenier: [ LAUGHS ]
Bradley: WE HAD SO MUCH
ON OUR SHOULDERS,
REPRESENTING EVERY
MILITARY SPOUSE
THAT'S WANTED SOMETHING MORE
THAN A PART-TIME JOB.
WE HOPE THAT WE CAN GROW
THIS COMPANY
AND HELP AS MANY MILITARY
SPOUSES AS POSSIBLE.
WE HOPE THAT WE INSPIRE
OTHER MILITARY SPOUSES
TO DO WHAT THEY LOVE
AND ASPIRE TO REACH THEIR GOALS,
DREAMS, AND PASSIONS.
Narrator: IN SEASON SIX,
WE WATCHED AIR FORCE VETERAN
KRISTINA GUERRERO
MAKE A DEAL WITH DAYMOND JOHN
FOR HER TurboPUP,
A MEAL-ON-THE-GO BAR FOR DOGS.
John: I'LL GO $100,000
FOR 40%.
-35%?
-YOU GOT IT.
Narrator: LET'S SEE
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO NOW.
KRISTINA!
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
DAYMOND,
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!
John: I'M IN PHOENIX TODAY
WITH KRISTINA FROM TurboPUP
FOR A BIG MEETING
AT PetSmart HEADQUARTERS.
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.
WHEN ARE YOU DUE?
NEXT MONTH.
AH. WELL,
WE BETTER HURRY UP.
YOU WANT TO MEET
THE PetSmart GUYS?
YES!
John: WHEN I FIRST SAW
KRISTINA PITCH,
IT JUST HIT ME -- THERE IS NO
CATEGORY FOR CANINE MEAL BARS.
I HAVE TWO DOGS THAT I LOVE,
AND I SAW THERE WAS A NEED
FOR THE PRODUCT.
-ERAN.
-DAYMOND.
THANKS FOR HAVING US.
Guerrero:
AFTER "SHARK TANK,"
DAYMOND HELPED ME PARTNER UP
WITH A COMPANY CALLED
FETCH FOR PETS!,
A LEADING DISTRIBUTOR
IN THE PET INDUSTRY.
THEY WERE INSTRUMENTAL
IN SETTING UP THIS AMAZING DEAL
WITH PetSmart.
THE IDEA OF A PORTABLE MEAL
SOLUTION -- AMAZING.
WE ARE PREPARED
TO PUT TurboPUP
IN MORE THAN 700 STORES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
700?!
WOW.
700.
Guerrero: UP UNTIL NOW,
WE'VE REALLY ONLY BEEN
AVAILABLE ONLINE,
AND IT'S REALLY LIMITED
OUR SALES.
BUT NOW TURBOPUPS EVERYWHERE
CAN TRY OUR BARS
AND FALL IN LOVE WITH IT,
JUST LIKE MY OWN TURBOPUPS HAVE.
-NICE.
-WOW.
THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING
IS MERCHANDISED
BEFORE IT GOES
TO A REAL STORE.
John: THIS IS A HUGE FIRST STEP
FOR TurboPUP,
AND WE HAVE SPEED TO MARKET.
AND ONCE YOU HAVE
SPEED TO MARKET,
GREAT DISTRIBUTION,
AND AN AMAZING PRODUCT,
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
Cohen: IS THIS NOT FABULOUS?
THIS IS AMAZING.
Guerrero:
I'D ONLY BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF,
WITH ONLY $11,000 IN SALES.
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE LESS
THAN A YEAR
SINCE I MADE MY DEAL
WITH DAYMOND,
AND WE HAVE OVER $200,000
IN SALES.
I THINK THIS DEAL WITH PetSmart
IS GONNA PUSH US TO OVER
$1 MILLION IN SALES.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND,
FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN.
OH, THANK YOU.
Guerrero: WHEN I HUNG UP
MY FLIGHT SUIT,
I DECIDED TO START A BUSINESS,
AND IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.
"SHARK TANK" REALLY RECOGNIZES
THAT VETERANS HAVE SO MUCH TO
BRING TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY,
AND IT'S BROUGHT SO MANY
OPPORTUNITIES TO TurboPUP.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A HIGH-TECH WAY
TO HAVE CONTROL RIGHT
AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.
