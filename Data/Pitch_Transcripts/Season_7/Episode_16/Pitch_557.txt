MY NAME IS ANGELA CODY ROUGET,
AND I WAS A MAJOR IN
THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.
I'M SEEKING $150,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY,
MAJOR MOM.
I AM ON A MISSION TO COMBAT
CLUTTER AND DISORGANIZATION
IN HOMES ACROSS AMERICA.
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CRAVE
MORE ORDER IN THEIR HOMES,
BUT MANY DON'T KNOW HOW
TO CREATE IT.
MY TEAM OF HIGHLY TRAINED
LIBERATORS
CAN PROFESSIONALLY ORGANIZE
EVERY ROOM IN YOUR HOME.
HERE ARE SOME "BEFORE"
AND "AFTER" PICTURES
OF SOME MISSIONS ACCOMPLISHED.
I SAVED THIS MARRIAGE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
THE WIFE'S CAR GOT BACK
IN THE GARAGE.
ALL THE HUSBAND'S STUFF
IS OUT OF THE WAY,
AND THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AGAIN
AND THEIR HOME.
THIS LITTLE GIRL CAN ACTUALLY
PLAY IN HER ROOM AGAIN.
ISN'T THAT SWEET?
AND NOW SHE'S ENJOYING HER HOME,
AND MAMA'S HAPPY.
SHARKS, MAJOR MOM
IS THE ONLY COMPANY
IN THE ORGANIZING-SERVICES
INDUSTRY
THAT EMBODIES MILITARY VALUES
AND TACTICS.
AS A MISSILE COMBAT
CREW COMMANDER,
I GAINED VALUABLE
ORGANIZING SKILLS,
SO MAJOR MOM IS HERE
TO SAVE THE DAY!
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP TO SCALE
OUR OPERATIONS.
IF THE PRESIDENT TRUSTED ME
WITH THE KEYS TO THE NUKES,
YOU CAN TRUST ME
WITH YOUR MONEY.
WHICH SHARK WANTS TO PARTNER
WITH ME TO COMBAT CLUTTER?
Grenier: I'M CURIOUS.
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
A MISSILE CREW COMMANDER.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THAT MEANT I HAD THE KEYS
TO MY NUKES.
MY ACTUAL HAND IS ON THE KEYS
THAT WOULD LAUNCH
INTERCONTINENTAL
BALLISTIC MISSILES
IN A FEW SECONDS.
GOOD. WHILE YOU'RE LAUGHING
AND ON THE PHONE.
THAT'S GOOD!
[ LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: THE ACTUAL
NUCLEAR MISSILES?
HOW DOES IT WORK, ANGELA?
I CALL YOU UP.
OKAY. SO, WHEN YOU CALL US,
WE DO A FREE ESTIMATE
ON THE PHONE.
RANGE GOES FROM $288
FOR A JUMP START PACKAGE --
THAT'S 4 HOURS OF JUST A "GET IN
THERE AND GET 'EM STARTED" --
UP TO A LIBERTY PACKAGE,
WHICH IS 46 HOURS OF HANDS-ON
ORGANIZING FOR $2,088.
SO, YOU DO
THE WHOLE HOUSE.
IT'S OUR NUMBER-ONE-SELLING
PACKAGE.
-THAT ONE IS.
-YEAH.
BUT DO YOU COME IN
AND, LIKE, REALLY, LIKE,
JUST GO THROUGH
THE WHOLE HOUSE?
WE HAVE A WHOLE TEAM.
WE HAVE SIX ORGANIZERS --
WE CALL OURSELVES "LIBERATORS"
-- GOING AT ONCE.
SO, THIS YEAR,
WHAT WILL YOUR SALES BE?
THIS YEAR, WE'RE ON TRACK
FOR $550,000 IN SALES.
THAT'S GREAT.
NO WAY.
LAST YEAR,
WE CLOSED AT $407,000.
WOW.
OKAY, NOW,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
YOU HAVE TWO LOCATIONS.
YES.
AND YOU OWN BOTH
OF THOSE LOCATIONS.
YES, MY BUSINESS PARTNER AND I
OWN THEM BOTH.
OKAY.
HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE
ON $550,000?
PERSONALLY,
MY BUSINESS PARTNER AND I
HAVE PAID OURSELVES BETWEEN
$20,000 AND $40,000 EVERY YEAR
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS
TO RUN THE BUSINESS.
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
AFTER PAYING ALL SALARIES,
PAYING ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES,
LAST YEAR WE PUT $25,000
TO THE BOTTOM LINE
BECAUSE WE RE-INVESTED A BUNCH
OF OUR PROFITS
TO GET READY TO FRANCHISE.
ASSUME YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.
WHAT WOULD THE PROFIT HAVE BEEN
AFTER PAYING YOURSELF?
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
$320,000.
WE SPENT A LOT ON LEGAL,
GETTING THE FRANCHISE
AGREEMENTS,
THE NEW ENTITY SET UP.
WHAT'S IT COST TO OPEN UP
A FRANCHISE?
$20,000 IS OUR INITIAL FEE,
AND VETERANS WILL GET
50% VALUE PRICE ON THAT.
AND WHAT ABOUT A ROYALTY
OR LIKE --
8% ROYALTY.
OKAY.
SO, BASICALLY,
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT LOW
BECAUSE MY TARGET MARKET
IS VETERANS.
I'M VERY AWARE
THAT MY TARGET MARKET
MAY NOT COME WITH A LOT OF CASH
TO THE TABLE.
AND SO I PUT UP EITHER $10,000
OR $20,000, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
THAT'S TO YOU, RIGHT?
YES.
WHAT IS MY CAP--
TO THE FRANCHISE.
SO, I WANT TO OPEN ONE UP
IN DALLAS.
WHAT OTHER OUT-OF-POCKET
EXPENSES AM I GONNA HAVE?
WE REQUIRE $5,000 IN MARKETING
TO OPEN UP THE CITY.
I GIVE YOU $25,000 TO GET
IN YOUR PROGRAM --
$20,000 PLUS THE $5,000
FOR MARKETING.
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL I MAKE
THE FIRST YEAR?
THE FIRST YEAR,
YOU'LL MAKE $30,000.
I GIVE YOU $25,000,
I MAKE $30,000,
IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL.
I HAVEN'T --
HOW -- HOW DO I LIVE?
WITH ME TRAINING THEM,
WITH OUR SYSTEMS,
WITH ALL OF OUR MARKETING,
WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE
IN PLACE,
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE
TO MAKE MORE.
HOWEVER, I'M GONNA STAY
CONSERVATIVE
AND SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY
ONLY GONNA MAKE $30,000
SO THAT THEY DON'T PUT THEIR
FAMILY IN A BAD SITUATION.
IS THE $150,000 FOR 20%
OF THE OVERALL COMPANY
OR JUST YOUR
FRANCHISEE COMPANY?
YOU WOULD GET 20%
OF BOTH COMPANIES.
DO I GET 20%
OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS
LIKE YOU
AND YOUR PARTNER GET?
ABSOLUTELY.
MY MAIN
EXIT STRATEGY --
FOR YOU TO
GET YOUR MONEY BACK,
I ONLY HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS
REALLY WELL.
I NEED TO SELL 150 FRANCHISES
AT $20,000 A POP,
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE 90%
OF THOSE FRANCHISES
ARE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.
SO, THE R-- THE ROYALTIES COME
ON THE BACK END.
YOU REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT
THAT IS, RIGHT?
-THAT'S VERY HARD.
-THAT IS REALLY HARD.
-THAT WAS A --
-IT'S DIFFICULT FOR CIVILIANS.
I LOVE THAT YOU KNOW
YOUR NUMBERS, THOUGH.
[ LAUGHS ]
IF WE DECIDE TO SELL,
THEN WE SELL AND CASH OUT,
OR WE LIVE OFF THE CASH COW
THAT I AM CREATING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I LOVE YOUR -- YOUR CERTAINTY.
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T
FRANCHISE?
WHAT IF YOU JUST TOOK
YOUR BUSINESS
AND CONTINUED TO GO THE WAY
THAT YOU WERE GOING?
IT'S JUST NOT FUN.
Herjavec: I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM
TO GET PEOPLE TO GIVE YOU
A CHECK FOR 25 GRAND.
WHY NOT SIMPLY BRING THEM
INTO THE PROGRAM?
LORI WANTS TO BE
A FRANCHISEE.
INSTEAD OF HER GIVING YOU
A CHECK DAY ONE FOR $25,000,
YOU GET HER GOING.
SHE OWES YOU THE $25,000,
BUT SHE SIMPLY PAYS IT
AT PORTION OF THE ROYALTY.
YOU JUST CREDIT -- YEAH.
THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE
REPLICATING YOU,
THE MORE MONEY
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE.
BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE TODAY.
I MEAN, I WISH YOU ALL
THE BEST, BUT...
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
...I-I CAN'T GET
THERE TODAY.
-OKAY.
-I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.
ANGELA, YOU ARE SO REMARKABLE
AT DOING THIS JOB --
HIRING THE RIGHT PEOPLE,
ORGANIZING THEM,
ACQUIRING CUSTOMERS.
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE A TORNADO.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE YOU
TO BE SUCCESSFUL
IN OTHER MARKETS,
AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE
VERY HARD TO DO.
FRANCHISORS WANT A DREAM THAT
THEY'RE GONNA OPEN A SUB SHOP
FOR $100,000 AND MAKE $1 MILLION
THE FIRST YEAR.
THEY DON'T ALWAYS MAKE IT,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUSINESS.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING
WITH IT.
BUT I DON'T THINK THE FRANCHISE
DEAL'S GONNA WORK.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU, MR. WONDERFUL.
I THINK THAT I HAVE SOME OF
THOSE SAME CHALLENGES,
THAT IT COSTS A LOT TO GET
INTO THE BUSINESS
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEES.
YEAH.
SO I AM ABSOLUTELY A CUSTOMER,
BUT I'M -- I CAN'T BE PART
OF THE BUSINESS. I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
THANK YOU.
Cuban: ANGELA,
WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU,
"WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GROW IT YOURSELF?"
YOU SAY THAT'S NOT VERY FUN.
WELL, IT'S MORE FUN TO HAVE A
BIG TEAM AND DO BIG THINGS...
WELL, EXACTLY.
...'CAUSE IN THE MILITARY,
WE HAVE BIG OPERATIONS
AND BIG TEAMS, AND IT'S --
EXACTLY. THAT'S THE SCARIEST
ANSWER YOU CAN --
IT'S MORE EXCITING.
THAT'S THE SCARIEST ANSWER
YOU CAN GIVE ME.
IT REALLY IS --
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
GONNA BE SOMETHING
MORE EXCITING.
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT
THAN JUST GRINDING IT OUT.
AND YOU THINK MANAGING
FRANCHISEES IS GONNA BE EASIER.
-[ CHUCKLES ]
-IT'S NOT.
I KNOW IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.
IT'S GONNA BE WORSE
'CAUSE THEY HAD THEIR
LIFE SAVINGS ON THE LINE.
RIGHT.
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS NOBLE, RIGHT?
THANK YOU.
TRYING TO HELP VETS --
THAT'S GREAT.
BUT I THINK YOU'RE
UNDERESTIMATING
THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S
GOING TO BE INVOLVED
RUNNING A FRANCHISE ORGANIZATION
AND GROWING IT.
OKAY.
AND SO I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU, MARK.
APPRECIATE THAT.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
LISTEN, ANGELA,
YOU DO WOMEN PROUD.
YOU'VE DONE AMAZING THINGS.
WHEN I STARTED MY BUSINESS,
I STARTED WITH ONE
EARRING ORGANIZER.
YES, I KNOW --
FOR YOUR MOM.
AND I'VE -- I HAVE MADE A CAREER
ON ORGANIZERS.
BUT I DON'T AGREE
WITH THE FRANCHISING.
I THINK YOU COULD GROW THIS
INTO SOMETHING VERY LUCRATIVE
FOR YOU
IF YOU KEEP IT SMALLER.
BE THE ONLY ONE
IN YOUR REGION,
AND YOU COULD BRING IN
A LOT OF MONEY.
BUT ONCE YOU START GOING
INTO THAT FRANCHISING MODEL,
YOU'RE GONNA SPREAD YOURSELF
SO THIN.
YOU'RE GONNA BE RELYING
ON A LOT OF PEOPLE,
AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF HEADACHES.
OKAY.
SO, THE REASON I'M OUT
IS BECAUSE I HAVE A DIFFERENCE
OF OPINION
AS TO WHERE I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE GOING WITH THE COMPANY.
GOOD POINT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
AND I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.
YOU ARE ALL FIVE-STAR GENERALS
TO ME, AND I SALUTE YOU.
-THANK YOU.
-AWW.
Cuban: CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR SUCCESS, ANGELA.
Grenier: WE SALUTE YOU.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
THANK YOU.
-SHE IS.
MY TIME IN THE TANK IS NOT
GONNA DERAIL MY EFFORTS
TO FRANCHISE MAJOR MOM
BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP VETERANS
HAVE SOME DIGNITY
WHEN THEY COME HOME
AND PUT THEM BACK TO WORK.
I WANT TO HELP ORGANIZE AMERICA,
AND I'M JUST GONNA KEEP GOING
ONWARD AND UPWARD
UNTIL I BECOME A NATIONAL BRAND.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A BUSINESS
THAT SEEKS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE
SURVIVING IN WAR-TORN
AND VOLATILE ENVIRONMENTS.
HELLO, SHARKS.
