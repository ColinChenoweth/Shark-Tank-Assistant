HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS TARIK RODGERS
FROM DALLAS, TEXAS.
WHAT!
THAT'S RIGHT.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND I AM THE C.E.O.
OF BEARTEK.
AND MY NAME IS WILLIE BLOUNT
FROM COLUMBIA, MARYLAND.
I AM THE FOUNDER
OF BEARTEK.
WE ARE HERE
SEEKING $500,000
FOR 5% INTEREST
IN OUR COMPANY.
WHOA.
-WHAT?!
-WHAT?
SHARKS,
WE LOVE THE OUTDOORS,
AND NOTHING IS BETTER THAN
HOPPING ON MY MOTORCYCLE
AND TAKING A LONG RIDE.
PROBLEM IS, WHENEVER I WANT
TO LISTEN TO MUSIC,
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
AND DANGEROUS
TO REACH FOR MY PHONE
TO PLAY A SONG.
AND ME -- AS A SKIER,
I WEAR GLOVES ALL THE TIME,
AND I RUN INTO THE EXACT
SAME PROBLEMS.
BEARTEK TRANSFORMS ANY GLOVE
INTO THE MOST CONVENIENT,
SAFE, AND ACCURATE
REMOTE CONTROL IMAGINABLE.
NOW YOUR SMARTPHONE IS ALWAYS
RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.
SO, SHARKS, LET ME JUST GET YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.
RAISE YOUR HANDS FOR ME.
NOW GO AHEAD
AND TAP YOUR THUMB
AND YOUR INDEX FINGER
TOGETHER.
[ MID-TEMPO
GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING ]
NOW GO AHEAD AND TAP ANOTHER ONE
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT MY SONG.
[ ELECTRIC GUITAR MUSIC
PLAYING ]
NO, THAT'S NOT MINE, EITHER.
LET'S GIVE IT ONE MORE.
[ FUNKY MUSIC PLAYS ]
THERE WE GO.
GIVE ME A TAP FOR SOME VOLUME.
LET'S JAM OUT NOW.
[ VOLUME INCREASES ]
ALL RIGHT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY,
NOW YOU CAN KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE ROAD AND THE SLOPES.
BUT MUSIC
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
NOW IT IS JUST THAT EASY TO
CONTROL ANY DEVICE IMAGINABLE,
FROM CONSUMER-ACTION CAMERAS
TO MILITARY-GRADE EQUIPMENT.
THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE ENDLESS.
IT IS OUR VISION THAT ALL GLOVES
WILL BE POWERED BY BEARTEK.
WE ARE NOT JUST A PRODUCT.
WE ARE A TECH COMPANY.
AND, SHARKS, WITH YOUR HELP,
WE COULD BECOME A TECH EMPIRE.
NOW, WHO'S READY TO BE...
Both:
...POWERED BY BEARTEK?
[ LAUGHTER ]
GREAT PRESENTATION, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
SHARKS,
TARIK WILL HAND OUT SOME GLOVES
TO YOU ALL,
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW THEY WORK.
HERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
FOR THE RIDER.
THERE YOU GO.
FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S THE NICE
SMALL SIZE THERE.
O'Leary: THANK YOU.
BEARTEK PACKAGING.
AND WITH YOU HERE --
YOU CAN PASS THIS OUT.
THIS IS THE MODULE
THAT'S INSIDE.
THIS IS THE BRAINS.
GOT IT.
SO, SHARKS, EVERY
"POWERED BY BEARTEK" GLOVE
HAS SIX TOUCH POINTS.
EACH TOUCH POINT HAS --
RECEIVES A DIFFERENT COMMAND
AND CAUSES THE BEHAVIOR
THAT YOU SEEK.
THE THUMB IS YOUR ACTIVATION
TOUCH POINT.
SO, THE ACT OF TOUCHING
YOUR THUMB
TO ANY OF THESE SIX TOUCH POINTS
CAUSES AN ACTION.
AS WAS DEMONSTRATED EARLIER,
VOLUME UP,
VOLUME DOWN,
NEXT AND PREVIOUS SONG,
ANSWER/REJECT CALLS,
OR START AND STOP YOUR MUSIC.
ON THE BACK OF EVERY GLOVE
IS A POCKET.
IN THAT POCKET IS WHERE THE
BEARTEK SYNC MODULE GOES.
YOU PLUG THAT INTO THE GLOVE,
AND YOU'RE OFF TO THE RACES.
SO, TELL ME
WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW.
SO, WE CREATED THE MODULE,
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER
ITERATIONS OF THIS GLOVE.
SO YOU'RE ONLY SELLING GLOVES
RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE SELLING GLOVES
AND MODULES.
HOWEVER,
OUR LONG-TERM PLAY
IS NOT TO BE IN THE
GLOVE-SELLING BUSINESS.
HERE WE GO.
WE ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS
OF SELLING GLOVES.
WE LAUNCHED
BEARTEK GLOVES
BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY.
WELL, YOU ARE IN THE BUSINESS
OF SELLING GLOVES TODAY,
BUT YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT
TO PROVE THE CONCEPT.
THIS IS YOUR PROOF
OF CONCEPT, YEAH.
-SO, WHAT WE DID WAS, IN --
-SO -- SO --
IN THE BEGINNING OF 2013,
WE ACTUALLY LAUN--
WE WENT TO A BUNCH
OF TRADE SHOWS.
GOT LOTS OF BRANDS
THAT WANTED
TO HAVE THIS POWER
IN THEIR GLOVES.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE REALIZED
IT TAKES THEM TWO YEARS
TO GO AHEAD, DESIGN,
DEVELOP IN THEIR --
THE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE.
SO WE SAID,
"WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT."
SO, IN FIVE MONTHS,
WE DID WHAT THESE COMPANIES
SAID IT WOULD TAKE THEM
TO DO TWO YEARS...
AND IN FIVE MONTHS --
AND HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD?
IN 15 MONTHS, WE DID A PILOT,
AND WE SOLD ABOUT 1,500 UNITS.
WHAT DO THEY COST?
THEY GO BETWEEN
$200 AND $275.
-DAMN!
-AND YOUR TOTAL SALES --
-IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GLOVE.
-$275?
DAMN!
WE SOLD $200,000 WORTH OF GLOVES
IN ABOUT 15 MONTHS.
SO, GUYS, HOW'D YOU TWO
START WORKING TOGETHER?
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUNDS?
WE'RE COUSINS,
SECOND COUSINS.
I WENT INTO
THE MARINE CORPS
AND STUDIED AVIATION
ELECTRONICS.
I WAS RIDING FOREVER,
AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE PROBLEM
OF CONTROLLING MY MUSIC.
AND, YOU KNOW, IN THE MARINES,
THERE'S THIS MANTRA WE HAVE.
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
YOU IMPROVISE, ADAPT,
AND OVERCOME...
ABSOLUTELY.
...THAT PROBLEM.
SO I CALLED TARIK,
AND HE WAS --
AS SOON AS I TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT, HE WAS LIKE, "I'M IN,"
BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY
HAD THE PROBLEM
THAT THIS WOULD HAVE SOLVED
WHILE HE WAS OUT ON THE SLOPES.
SO, AFTER THAT,
WE GOT TOGETHER.
MY TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
AND HIS BUSINESS BACKGROUND --
TARIK, HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU PUT IN?
I'VE PUT IN $500,000.
OH!
WOW!
WHERE DID YOU
GET THE $500,000?
I'VE HAD A LOT OF CAREER
IN FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES,
BUT THE LAST 7 YEARS
OF MY CAREER
HAVE ALL BEEN
IN START-UPS.
BUT YOU HAD THE CASH.
SO WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE
MONEY OUT OF OUR POCKET
AND PUT IT IN THERE.
HOW -- WHY IS IT WORTH
$10 MILLION?
I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD THAT.
OKAY, SO, ALL WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT NOW -- CONSUMER SPACE.
OKAY.
WHAT WE ALSO HAVE GOING ON
AT THIS VERY MOMENT --
MILITARY COMPANIES STARTED
COMING TO US, SAYING,
"HEY, WE WANT TO CONTROL
HEADS-UP DISPLAYS,
NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES,
COMPUTER-AIDED SCOPES.
WITH GLOVES.
WITH GLOVES.
THE POINT IS, OUR MARKET ARE
PEOPLE THAT WEAR GLOVES.
ONCE YOU PUT GLOVES ON,
IT INHIBITS YOU
FROM BEING ABLE TO CONTROL
YOUR TECHNOLOGY.
OKAY. I GOT YOU.
HERE'S WHAT I'M EXPECTING YOU
TO SAY.
FOR A $10-MILLION VALUATION,
I'M EXPECTING YOU
TO GO BEYOND GLOVES
'CAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I'M NOT SUPER EXCITED
ABOUT GIVING YOU $500,000
FOR 5% FOR A GLOVE COMPANY.
I FEAR YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
A DEAL HERE TODAY.
IT'S NOT JUST
A GLOVE COMPANY, THOUGH.
EXACTLY RIGHT.
Herjavec: BUT THAT'S WHAT
I'M WAITING TO HEAR.
WHEN DO WE GO
BEYOND GLOVES?
SO, HERE'S THE THING --
I'VE BEEN PUSHING MY FINGERS
LIKE THIS FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
TRYING TO HEAR WHY YOU'RE
WORTH $10 MILLION,
AND IT'S NOT WORKING.
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN,
BUT THEY QUESTION THE
$10-MILLION VALUATION
FOR WILLIE AND TARIK'S HIGH-TECH
GLOVE COMPANY, BEARTEK.
I'VE BEEN PUSHING MY FINGERS
LIKE THIS FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
TRYING TO HEAR WHY
YOU'RE WORTH $10 MILLION,
AND IT'S NOT WORKING.
WE'RE PUTTING AN OPPORTUNITY
IN FRONT OF YOU
THAT IS GOING TO --
THAT IS GONNA GET TO
AT LEAST $32 MILLION.
WE HAVE MAJOR RETAILERS THAT ARE
STARTING TO CARRY THIS.
O'Leary: LET ME TAKE
A CRACK AT THIS.
I'M LOOKING AT IT THIS WAY.
NO ONE ELSE HAS BROUGHT IT UP,
BUT I MIGHT AS WELL.
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO
INTERFACE WITH DEVICES
THAT DON'T REQUIRE MANIPULATION
BY YOUR DIGITS, OKAY?
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN A HELMET NOW
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SPEAK
TO A DEVICE
WHILE YOU'RE RIDING.
