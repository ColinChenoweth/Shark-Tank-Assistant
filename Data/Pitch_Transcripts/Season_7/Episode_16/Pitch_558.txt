IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER IT'S A CAR
OR WHETHER YOU'RE ON A BIKE
OR A BICYCLE.
-I'VE SEEN IT FOR...
-HOW ACCURATE IS IT?
Herjavec:
VERY ACCURATE.
WHAT'S YOUR GREATEST STRENGTH
AGAINST VOICE ACTIVATION?
ONE, YOU C-- YOU DON'T MAKE ANY
MISTAKES USING THIS PRODUCT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW PRECISELY WHERE
YOU'RE TOUCHING YOUR FINGER.
WITH VOICE ACTIVATION...
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
THAT'S A FAIR POINT.
...IT HAS HISTORICALLY HAPPENED
WHERE YOU TRY TO SAY SOMETHING
AND IT EITHER MISREADS YOU AND
IT UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING ELSE
AND THEN YOU GOT TO BACK OUT
OF THAT COMMAND SET
TO TRY TO GET BACK IN
AND SAY WHAT YOU WOULD
YOU LIKE IT TO SAY.
BUT THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
IN INDUSTRIAL
THAN WHICH SONG YOU PICK.
-IT'S A NICHE APPLICATION.
-SURE, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR OPTION
ISN'T A GOOD ONE.
IT COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE.
IT MAY BE THAT THE MARKET'S
PASSED YOU BY.
I'M NOT GONNA STICK AROUND
TO FIND OUT.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Cuban: THE AMOUNT OF TIME
YOU HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THEM TO INTEGRATE
AND THEN SELL,
AND THEN YOU STILL HAVE
THAT ENTIRE RISK PROFILE
OF NOT KNOWING
IF THEY'LL SELL --
THE RISK/REWARD IS NOT THERE.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I THINK THERE'S
SOME MERIT HERE,
BUT HONESTLY, GUYS,
YOU'RE ASKING FOR
A $10-MILLION VALUATION.
IF YOU WOULD HAVE SAID MAYBE,
"I HAVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS,"
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
WE'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE SAME UNIVERSE.
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA PUT AN OFFER
OUT AT THAT PRICE,
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
GUYS, TO ME, WHAT I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD SAY
WAS THAT THE GLOVE
WAS SIMPLY A --
A CARRIER FOR THE TECHNOLOGY,
BUT IT'S ONE OF MANY.
BUT EVERY TIME ANYBODY
ASKED YOU A QUESTION,
WE ALWAYS WENT BACK
TO THE GLOVE.
ROBERT,
IS THERE ANY VALUATION
THAT YOU WOULD GIVE
THESE GUYS $500,000?
WHAT PERCENTAGE
WOULD YOU NEED?
WILLIE, THERE ARE --
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THIS COMPANY'S WORTH.
LOOK, HERE'S THE FIRST THING
I'LL TELL YOU --
IS THERE A NUMBER?
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU'VE DEVELOPED
THE TECHNOLOGY.
BUT WHEN YOU COME IN WITH
A $10 MILLION VALUATION,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT
VERY SERIOUSLY.
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE GLOVE
BUSINESS FOR $10 MILLION.
-I-I --
-NEITHER DO WE.
WELL, BUT YOU
HAVEN'T SHOWN ME
HOW YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT
OF THE GLOVE BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
THE REASON WHY WE DON'T
WANT TO BE IN THE GLOVE
BUSINESS SO MUCH
IS BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED
FROM CONSUMERS,
THEY ARE VERY PARTICULAR
ABOUT THE GLOVES THEY WEAR.
SO WE CAN'T CARRY
A MILLION SKUs
ON A MILLION DIFFERENT KINDS OF
GLOVES TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY.
I LIKE YOU GUYS.
I THINK YOU'RE SMART.
I THINK IT IS A VERY CLEVER
APPLICATION.
I LIKE ANYTHING
THAT KEEPS YOU SAFER.
RIGHT.
SO I THINK YOU REALLY HAVE
SOMETHING HERE
THAT WILL BE APPEALING
TO THE CONSUMER
AND MAYBE TO THE ARMY AND --
AND EVERYBODY ELSE,
BUT YOU'RE JUST AT THIS POINT
OF FIGURING IT OUT.
YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE YET.
MM-HMM.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
-THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
-ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
CONGRATS, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.
-ALL RIGHT, NOW.
-ALL RIGHT.
IF THERE'S EVER A DEAL THAT
TELLS YOU VALUATION MATTERS,
IT'S THIS ONE.
NO, NOT AT ALL,
NOT AT ALL.
ABSOLUTELY, MARK.
DOES IT? NO.
WHY DIDN'T YOU STEP UP
AND WRITE A CHECK?
I'M TELLING YOU
THAT THEY'LL --
THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF
STUFF YOU LOVE TO DO.
IF -- IF THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN
ME A PROOF OF CONCEPT --
BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S A PIECE
OF CRAP.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A BUSINESS
THAT BRINGS MILITARY PRECISION
TO YOUR HOME.
HELLO, SHARKS.
THAT'S A -- A MISSILEER
CAN MULTITASK.
I'M TRAINED TO DO
75 TASKS AT ONCE
AND DO THEM ALL VERY WELL.
SO, WHAT'S THE -- WHAT'S
THE CLOSEST YOU CAME?
IF I TOLD YOU,
I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.
THAT'S OKAY.
GO AHEAD! PLEASE!
PLEASE TELL US!
THAT'S OKAY.
SO, WHEN DID
YOU LEAVE SERVICE?
HOW LONG AGO?
-I LEFT THE SERVICE 10 --
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE,
BY THE WAY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I LEFT THE SERVICE 10 YEARS AGO.
AND WHAT -- WHAT MADE YOU
COME UP WITH THIS IDEA?
WELL, BASICALLY, WHEN I DECIDED
TO GET OUT OF THE MILITARY,
I WAS GONNA BE
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, MY HUSBAND'S
REAL-ESTATE BUSINESS TANKED
LITERALLY SIX MONTHS AFTER
I RESIGNED MY COMMISSION.
SO HE SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO GO BACK TO WORK."
DID YOU NUKE HIM?
[ LAUGHS ]
I WANTED TO.
SO, ANYWAY...
I SAID, "OKAY, WELL,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?"
AND HE SAID,
"YOU'RE SO ORGANIZED.
YOU LOVE TO DO IT.
YOU DO IT ALL THE TIME."
TELL US ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
WE ARE BASICALLY IN TWO STATES.
WE HAVE 16 EMPLOYEES.
SO, IN COLORADO AND PHOENIX,
ARIZONA,
WE HAVE BUILT THIS MODEL
OVER A SIX-YEAR PERIOD OF TIME.
WE TRAIN THEM HOW WE WANT THEM
TO ORGANIZE
WITH THE MAJOR MOM METHOD
OF ORGANIZING.
LORI KNOWS THAT, WITH
OUR ORGANIZING PRODUCTS,
IS YOU CAN'T
JUST BUY A PRODUCT.
THERE'S AN APPROACH
TO ORGANIZING.
MY NAME IS MATT GRIFFIN.
PLEASE CALL ME "GRIFF."
I'M DONALD LEE.
CALL ME "LEE."
WE'RE COMBAT FLIP FLOPS...
[ CHUCKLES ]
...AND WE'RE SEEKING $150,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, WE'RE HERE TODAY
TO ENLIST YOU
INTO THE UNARMED FORCES.
WHAT WE DO IS SIMPLE --
WE MAKE COOL PRODUCTS
IN DANGEROUS PLACES.
IN OUR PAST LIVES,
GRIFF AND I WERE ARMY RANGERS.
OUR MOTTO STATES,
"RANGERS LEAD THE WAY."
OOH RAH.
OUR MISSION IS TO CREATE
BADASS PRODUCTS
BY SKILLED ENTREPRENEURS
SURVIVING IN AREAS OF CONFLICT.
THIS MISSION PROVIDES PEACEFUL,
SUSTAINABLE CHANGE
IN AREAS THAT NEED HOPE.
OUR FOOTWEAR IS MADE
IN BOGOTá, COLOMBIA.
WE SUPPORT CRAFTSMEN,
NOT CARTELS.
OUR BELTS, SARONGS, SCARVES,
AND CASHMERE
ARE MADE IN AFGHANISTAN.
WE EMPLOY WOMEN AND PUT
LITTLE GIRLS IN SCHOOL.
WE PARTNER WITH
A DE-MINING ORGANIZATION IN LAO
TO MAKE A LINE OF JEWELRY
OUT OF LAND MINES.
SHARKS, RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE
PROBABLY THINKING WE'RE CRAZY.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT SOMEBODY PROBABLY SAID
THE SAME THING TO YOU ONCE,
AND IT DIDN'T STOP YOU.
WE KNOW THAT BUSINESSES ARE
MORE POWERFUL THAN BULLETS.
SO, SHARKS, ENLIST IN
THE UNARMED FORCES TODAY.
WE BROUGHT YOU SOME GEAR
FROM COLOMBIA, AFGHANISTAN,
AND LAO.
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
I LOVE FLIP-FLOPS.
ROBERT, WE GOT YOU THE --
THE AK-47s.
THESE ARE REALLY
COMFORTABLE.
THESE ARE BEAUTIFULLY MADE.
Cuban:
WHERE'D YOU GUYS SERVE AT?
WE SERVED WITH
THE 2nd RANGER BATTALION,
75th RANGER REGIMEN.
WHERE?
WE DID TWO TOURS
IN AFGHANISTAN TOGETHER.
I DID ONE TOUR IN IRAQ.
AND DID YOU START
THE BUSINESSES THEN?
WE -- WE HAD ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT
STARTING A BUSINESS TOGETHER,
RIGHT, AND -- AND JUST,
THROUGH OUR EXPERIENCES
IN AFGHANISTAN,
WE -- YOU KNOW, WE FOUND
THAT WE WANTED TO DO MORE
FOR THE COUNTRY OTHER
THAN GO OVER THERE AND
BE SOLDIERS, RIGHT?
WE WANTED TO
KIND OF GIVE BACK.
AND WE --
AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT.
SO -- SO, I'M GONNA SPECULATE
THAT THESE ARE
YOUR BIGGEST SELLERS.
THEY ARE.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE THEM
AND WHAT DO THEY COST LANDED,
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU SELL
THEM FOR HERE?
SO, OUR FULL-LEATHER MODELS --
THE AK --
THOSE WILL COST US
$20 TO MAKE.
AND RIGHT NOW THEY COST US
$4.90 TO LAND EACH.
SO RIGHT AROUND $25 BECAUSE
WE'RE AIR-SHIPPING THEM IN.
WHY ARE YOU AIR-SHIPPING?
WELL, BECAUSE
WE JUST HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP
WITH DEMAND.
WE WERE SELLING THEM AS FAST
AS WE HAD THEM.
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS,
WE'VE BEEN SOLD OUT OF PRODUCT.
WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU
SELL THEM FOR?
WHAT WILL YOU SELL THEM
FOR? YES.
WE'RE SELLING THEM
FOR $70.
WHERE WERE YOU
SELLING THEM THROUGH?
LAST YEAR,
WE HAD 89% ONLINE,
DIRECT THROUGH OUR WEBSITE,
AND 11% THROUGH WHOLESALERS.
WHAT ARE YOUR TOTAL SALES,
GRIFF?
LAST YEAR,
WE DID $134,000,
AND WE JUST ECLIPSED
LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HIT
$300,000.
WILL YOU MAKE MONEY THIS YEAR?
WE'RE ALREADY MAKING MONEY
THIS YEAR.
HOW MUCH YOU MAKING?
WE'RE GONNA BE AT 5% NET
THIS YEAR.
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH VARIOUS
DIFFERENT TERRITORIES,
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES,
YOU KNOW?
I REMEMBER WE OPENED A FACTORY
IN AFRICA,
AND WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL
THE WORKERS HAD -- HAD BIKES.
IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHERE THE CHALLENGES WERE.
SO I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE
GONNA BE COMPLICATED.
NOW, WITH THAT BEING SAID,
WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO SCALE THIS ACCORDINGLY
AND TO PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE
WHEN THEY WANT IT?
WE BELIEVE SO.
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SCALE,
WE'LL BE VERY HONEST
ABOUT IT.
BUT WE GOT GUYS WHO DO.
HEY, I'M A HUGE, HUGE,
HUGE BELIEVER
IN BUSINESS OVER BULLETS,
AND IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ANY IMPACT
ON THE REST OF THE WORLD,
WE GOT TO EXPORT
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
SO, YOU SAID YOU WERE MAKING
SOMETHING IN AFGHANISTAN.
GIVE ME THE SCOOP.
SO, WE FOUND A WOMAN-OWNED
FACTORY,
AND WE SAID, "HEY,
CAN YOU MAKE SOME SARONGS?"
AND THEIR FIRST QUESTION WAS,
YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S A SARONG?"
YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT
BEACHWEAR TO AFGHAN WOMEN,
AND THEY DON'T KNOW.
SO, WE HAD TO --
I'M STILL SHOCKED THEY LET
AN AFGHANI WOMAN OPEN A --
OPEN A BUSINESS
AND HAVE A FACTORY.
HER NAME'S
HASSINA SHERJAN.
AND SHE LEFT AFGHANISTAN
WITH HER FAMILY,
AND SHE WAS EDUCATED
IN AMERICA.
AND SHE HEARD THAT AFGHAN WOMEN
WERE BEING PERSECUTED.
SO SHE FLEW BACK.
IN THE MID '90s,
SHE FUNDED UNDERGROUND,
CLANDESTINE SCHOOLS
FOR GIRLS...
WOW.
...DURING THE YEARS
OF THE TALIBAN.
NOW SHE'S MANAGING ALL
THE SECONDARY EDUCATION
FOR AFGHAN WOMEN.
SHE'S TAKEN THE MONEY
FROM THE FACTORY
THAT SHE'S MAKING
AND EDUCATING?
YEAH,
AND WE'RE MATCHING HER.
THAT'S AMAZING.
FIRST OF ALL,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
I'M CHALLENGED
WITH HOW YOU SCALE THIS
WITH SO MANY PRODUCTS.
LOVE YOUR BACKGROUND.
LOVE THE DISCIPLINE.
NOBODY HAS DISCIPLINE
LIKE VETS.
BUT IT'S TOO MANY PRODUCTS
FOR THE SIZE YOU ARE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE NARROW,
AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY DEEP.
OR IT'S A PERSONAL CAUSE,
WHICH IS FINE.
BUT THE CHALLENGE IS, ROBERT,
IF THEY GO NARROW AND DEEP
ON THIS PRODUCT,
THEN THEY WILL BE ABANDONING
A LOT OF THE TERRITORIES
THEY'RE HELPING THAT DOESN'T
MAKE THIS PRODUCT.
BUT THE REALITY
OF THE SITUATION --
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $150,000
FOR 10% OF THE COMPANY.
YOU'RE GIVING A VALUE OF
$1.5 MILLION ON THE COMPANY.
AND WE HAVE TO, AT THIS POINT,
ADDRESS THAT, TO SOME EXTENT.
WE JUST SIGNED
A CANADIAN DISTRIBUTOR
THAT'S SELLING
INTO 390 STORES.
WE JUST OPENED IN NEGOTIATIONS
WITH THE MILITARY EXCHANGES.
-WHICH PRODUCTS?
-YEAH, WHICH --
THEY'RE GONNA BE BUYING
THE FOOTWEAR.
Herjavec: JUST THE FOOTWEAR?
JUST THE FOOTWEAR IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON.
O'Leary: I THINK WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE DOING IS REALLY --
IT'S GOOD AND IT'S NOBLE
AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING.
BUT THE FUNDAMENTALS
OF THE BUSINESS HERE --
THE DIVERSIFICATION YOU'VE PUT
INTO YOUR MODEL
ADDS A LOT OF
OPERATIONAL LOGISTICS RISK.
I MEAN,
SUPPLYING THESE PRODUCTS
FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
IS HARD ENOUGH.
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED
TO SEE A --
A MYOPIC FOCUS
ON THE FOOTWEAR,
TO BUILD IT UP TO A $5-MILLION,
$10-MILLION BUSINESS
AND, WITH THE PROFITS
FROM THAT,
SUPPORT ALL THESE
OTHER INITIATIVES
YOU WANT TO DO
BECAUSE, IN THE END,
A BUSINESS HAS TO MAKE MONEY
TO SURVIVE
AND KEEP ALL THE PEOPLE
EMPLOYED,
WHICH IS WHAT YOU GUYS
WANT TO DO.
I'M FINDING THE DEAL
TOO DIVERSIFIED
AND NOT FOCUSED ENOUGH, IN TERMS
OF BEING AN INVESTMENT.
SO, FOR ME, I'M OUT.
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU,
KEVIN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S HOW WE MARK THE DEAD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH!
WOW.
I LOVE IT.
-I LOVE THAT.
-I LOVE IT.
I SHOULD GIVE YOU AN OFFER
JUST FOR THAT.
COOL.
Herjavec: GRIFF,
YOU HAVE A GREAT STORY,
YOU HAVE A GREAT BRAND,
BUT IT'S TOO MANY PRODUCTS
FOR THIS SIZE.
IT'S GONNA BE CHALLENGING
TO KEEP GROWING.
I'M OUT.
PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME
AN ORANGE THING.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
NO, WE'RE GOOD.
Grenier:
I LIKE THE MISSION.
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
FOR SERVING OUR COUNTRY.
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I KNOW THAT.
I THINK DAYMOND KNOWS THAT, TOO.
I DO AGREE
WITH THE OTHER SHARKS
ABOUT FOCUSING IN ON SOMETHING
THAT'S YOUR STRENGTH,
LIKE THE FLIP-FLOPS,
THEN BRANCHING OUT,
IS SMARTER, TO ME.
IF ANOTHER SHARK
WILL GO IN WITH ME...
I'D BE WILLING TO MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
WHAT WOULD YOU OFFER?
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
IF SOMEONE ELSE
IS INTERESTED IN GOING IN
WITH ME,
IF MARK OR DAYMOND IS.
THEN THAT WOULD JUST
BE 200K FOR 25%.
MARK? DAYMOND?
WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION
OVER HERE.
OH.
I WANTED TO SEE
IF EITHER OF YOU
WERE INTERESTED IN COMING IN
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOUR HEADS ARE AT.
YEAH. UH, I THINK MARK --
MARK WANTED TO GIVE
SOME THOUGHTS RIGHT HERE.
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT?
YEAH.
OKAY.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN -- YOU CAN SAY IT.
LOOK,
WE'RE BOTH BIG BELIEVERS.
I MEAN, BUSINESS OVER BULLETS
EVERY DAY.
SO, WHILE FROM A PURELY
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE,
FOCUSING, YOU KNOW,
ON YOUR CORE PRODUCT
WOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE,
THERE'S A BIGGER PICTURE HERE.
YOU'VE GOT TWO STORIES
GOING ON,
ONE IN THE -- THE --
THE FOOTWEAR,
ONE WITH THE SARONGS OR WHATEVER
THE HECK THESE ARE CALLED.
WE -- WE WANT -- WHATEVER
YOU'RE MAKING IN AFGHANISTAN,
WE WANT TO MAKE MORE
OF IT, RIGHT?
WE WANT TO HIRE
MORE PEOPLE.
WE WANT MORE PEOPLE
TO BE EDUCATED.
SO HERE'S THE OFFER.
YOU ASKED FOR 150K FOR 10%.
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS GIVE YOU
200K, BUT FOR 25%.
SO, DAYMOND'S WILLING TO LET ME
IN ON THAT OFFER.
WE'RE SPLITTING IT THREE WAYS.
NO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LIKE HE SAID, LORI,
WE DON'T WANT YOU.
THIS IS 12.5%,
12.5% OVER HERE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PUT UP ANY CASH,
AND YOU GET TO PICK
ANY OF THE PRODUCTS
THAT YOU FEEL WORK
FOR YOUR OUTLETS.
AND WHAT DO I MAKE
FROM THAT?
-YOUR MARKUP.
-YOUR MONEY, YOUR MARKUP.
JUST ON THOSE PRODUCTS.
I WOULD RATHER BE A PARTNER
WITH YOU.
I THINK THE BUSINESS NEEDS
A FEMININE TOUCH, GUYS.
-NO!
-THANK YOU.
WE'RE PUTTING WOMEN
IN SCHOOL.
WELL, LOOK,
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT,
THEN WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE
TO COME BACK AND ASK FOR 30%.
WOULD YOU DO A DEAL,
30% FOR THREE SHARKS?
THAT'S A LOT OF --
THAT'S A LOT OF HORSEPOWER.
THEY WOULD HAVE TO UP THE CASH
TO DO THAT.
O'Leary:
WELL, MAYBE THEY WILL.
YOU GOT TO COME BACK.
CAN YOU DO $300,000
FOR 30%?
I'LL DO $110,000.
I DON'T CARE. YOU GUYS?
-DONE.
-DONE!
-DONE.
BUSINESS.
LET'S GO TO WORK.
THANK YOU, SIR.
CONGRATULATIONS, GRIFF.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE.
LOOKING FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
-[ CHUCKLES ]
THANK YOU, KEVIN.
THANK YOU.
-CONGRATS, GUYS.
-THANKS, GUYS.
-THANK YOU, MARK.
-GOOD JOB.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE TOO
MUCH OF THE COMPANY, THAT'S ALL.
Grenier:
NO, I TOTALLY GET IT.
IT'S A GOOD CAUSE.
-I GOT TO TELL YOU, I --
-IT'S A GOOD MISSION.
-I LOVE THEIR MISSION.
I REALLY LOVE
THIS PRODUCT.
-I AGREE.
-YEAH.
[ LAUGHS ]
-WE DID IT.
-IT'S AWESOME.
WE'RE GONNA HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE
AND DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS.
WE THINK MARK'S GONNA HELP US
DOMINATE THE TECH SPACE
WHERE WE WANT TO BE,
DAYMOND'S GONNA HELP US
WITH BRANDING,
AND LORI'S GONNA HELP
WITH DISTRIBUTION.
IT'S A DREAM TEAM.
RIGHT.
WE COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED.
YEAH.
