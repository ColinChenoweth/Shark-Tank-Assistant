MY NAME
IS MARTIN DELL'ARCIPRETE,
AND I'M FROM PHILADELPHIA, P.A.
MY COMPANY IS SmartPlate,
AND I'M SEEKING $1 MILLION
FOR A 15% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
WHOA.
EVERY DAY,
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WORK HARD
TO MAINTAIN
A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE.
FROM HEALTH-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS
TO ELITE ATHLETES,
SUCCESS COMES DOWN
TO EATING SMART.
THE PROBLEM IS EATING SMART
WITH CURRENT SOLUTIONS
REQUIRES TEDIOUS
MANUAL CALORIE-COUNTING,
WHICH IS TIME CONSUMING,
FRUSTRATING,
AND, WORST OF ALL, INACCURATE.
SmartPlate IS THE WORLD'S FIRST
INTELLIGENT PLATE
THAT INSTANTLY ANALYZES
YOUR ENTIRE MEAL
WITH UP TO 99% ACCURACY.
IT USES FOOD-RECOGNITION
TECHNOLOGY AND LOAD SENSORS
TO IDENTIFY AND WEIGH EVERYTHING
SITTING ON ITS SURFACE.
FROM SINGLE FOODS
TO PREPARED MEALS,
LIKE PIZZA,
VEGETABLE-FRIED RICE,
AND EVEN A GARDEN SALAD.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PLACE YOUR FOOD ON THE PLATE
THE WAY YOU NORMALLY WOULD,
AND BAM --
GET ALL YOUR NUTRITIONAL
INFORMATION IN A SNAP.
WOW.
INCLUDING CALORIES, CARBS,
AND PROTEINS.
OUR MISSION IS TO GET SmartPlate
INTO THE HANDS
OF EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTS
TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY TO TAKE
A BITE OUT OF SmartPlate?
DO YOU HAVE PLATES
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT?
YES, YES, I DO.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SEE IT.
I'M GONNA HAND THOSE OUT
RIGHT NOW.
SO, WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE
OF OUR MERCHANDISING,
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE
A PROTOTYPE
OF THE SmartPlate.
A PROTOTYPE.
PRO-- UH-OH.
OH.
LET'S GET INTO
THE TECHNOLOGY.
YES. SO, THE WAY THAT IT WORKS
IS IT TAKES A PICTURE,
AND THEN IT ANALYZES
THE PICTURE,
AND IT'S ABLE
TO IDENTIFY THE FOOD.
COMBINES THAT
WITH THE WEIGHT INFORMATION.
ONCE WE HAVE BOTH OF THOSE,
THEN WE ARE ABLE TO TELL YOU
THE MICRO- AND MACRONUTRIENTS.
HOW DOES IT DIFFERENTIATE
FRIED RICE
WITH A CERTAIN TYPE OF OIL
AND ANOTHER TYPE OF OIL,
YOU KNOW?
SO, OILS AND THINGS
OF THAT NATURE,
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO PICK UP,
BUT WE DO HAVE A SOLUTION
FOR THAT.
SO, WE GIVE CONSUMERS
THREE OPTIONS.
THEY CAN EITHER "SNAP IT,"
"SCAN IT," OR "SAY IT."
SO, WE HAVE OVER 350,000
CPG BARCODES.
IF SOMEBODY'S OUT
AT A RESTAURANT,
WE HAVE A DATABASE
OF RESTAURANT MEALS, AS WELL.
OVER 100,000
RESTAURANT MEALS.
SO, I'M FROM NEW YORK CITY.
AND HERE'S
WHAT WE BELIEVE --
ON THE EIGHTH DAY,
GOD MADE STREET MEAT.
THERE'S NO BARCODE
ON THE DIRTY, LITTLE HOT DOGS
THAT I EAT OUT THERE.
HOW -- HOW IS THAT
GONNA HELP ME?
IF YOU TAKE A PICTURE
OF THE HOT DOG,
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE AND
IDENTIFY THAT IT'S A HOT DOG.
THEN, IF IT WAS -- IT WAS ON,
YOU KNOW, THE SmartPlate,
WE'D BE ABLE
TO IDENTIFY THE WEIGHT.
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE SmartPlate,
JUST WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE
AND THE "SNAP IT" FEATURE,
YOU'D BE ABLE
TO TAKE A PICTURE.
WE'D SAY
THAT IT'S A HOT DOG.
MARTIN, CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE
HOW THAT APP ACTUALLY WORKS
SO WE GET
A BETTER FEEL FOR IT?
I'D LOVE TO DO THAT.
WHAT'S FIRING RIGHT NOW
IS THE FOOD-RECOGNITION
PORTION.
WE DON'T HAVE
THE WEIGHT SENSORS
IN THESE
AESTHETIC PROTOTYPES YET,
BUT I CAN DEMONSTRATE THE
FUNCTIONALITY, IF THAT'S OKAY.
WE'RE GONNA HIT "SNAP IT."
THEN WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT
OUR PIECE OF PIZZA HERE.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A PICTURE.
[ CELLPHONE CAMERA CLICKS ]
AND, THEN WITHIN SECONDS,
IT'LL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT.
AND THERE YOU SEE IT.
I SEE
THREE CAMERAS THERE.
YES.
SO, TALK ABOUT THOSE.
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH, BECAUSE WHAT WERE YOU --
WHAT WERE USING YOUR PHONE FOR
IF THE CAMERAS ARE ALL
IN THIS -- IN THE PLATE.
I WAS -- SO, WHAT I WAS
USING MY PHONE FOR
WAS TO SIMULATE THE CAMERAS.
WE DON'T HAVE --
OH, YOU WERE SIMULATING
THESE CAMERAS IN HERE.
THAT'S CORRECT.
OKAY, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
BUT THOSE CAMERAS
CAN SEE THAT.
I MEAN, THE ASPECT --
IT'S ONE THING
TO GET AN OVERHEAD VIEW.
WE HAVE AN INDUSTRIAL-DESIGN
FIRM OUT OF PHILLY.
WE'VE GONE OVER
ALL THE SPECS.
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO IS
IT'S GONNA BE LIFTED.
IT'S GONNA BE RAISED,
SO IT'S ABOVE THE FOOD, OKAY?
THE CAMERA'S
ABOVE THE FOOD?
IT'S GONNA BE ABLE TO GIVE US
A 180 VIEW.
GETTING TO MARKET, OKAY,
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF
THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE WORK.
PARTICULARLY
THE CAMERA TECHNOLOGY.
YES.
I USE THESE APPS.
IT WORKS.
YOU'RE NOT USING THE APP
PROPERLY.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE
AN ADONIS BODY.
SO,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I'M THINKING IF YOU SOLD
THE PLATE WITHOUT THE CAMERAS
AND I USED
JUST MY OWN PHONE,
COULDN'T I GET
A LOW-COST VERSION
AND GET TO MARKET
A LOT FASTER
THAN ALL THIS FUTURE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
LET ME JUST PAINT A LITTLE BIT
OF A BETTER PICTURE
AS TO WHERE WE STAND
CURRENTLY.
'CAUSE I SMELL PRE-REVENUE
ALL OVER THIS.
LET ME TALK
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SALES.
PRE-REVENUE?
IT'S PRE-PRODUCT.
LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE TOTAL PICTURE HERE.
CAN I BUY
A SmartPlate NOW?
WE'RE TAKING PRE-ORDERS.
WE'RE NOT PLANNING
TO DELIVER SmartPlate
UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 2016.
HOW MUCH IS THE PLATE
GONNA COST AT RETAIL?
YEAH, SO, IT'S GONNA RETAIL
FOR $199.
OH.
FOR US, THAT'S A 469% --
MARTIN, HONEY, SWEETIE, POOPSY,
THAT'S CRAZY.
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE INTO
THIS BUSINESS RIGHT NOW?
WE RAISED $225,000
FROM INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED
INVESTORS.
WE HAVE $80,000
FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
AND WE'VE SOFT-CIRCLED $550,000
OF THIS ROUND.
SOFT-CIRCLED FROM?
SOFT-CIRCLE?
TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS.
IS THAT THE SOFT LIKE
SOFT-SERVE?
[ LAUGHS ]
NO, IT ISN'T.
YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVEY
THE MESSAGE
THAT OTHER PEOPLE
ARE INTERESTED.
I'M NOT ASKING THAT,
I JUST WANT --
THAT'S CORRECT, MARK. YES.
I GOT IT.
BUT I JUST --
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE WAY THAT
YOU'RE MAKING THIS PITCH.
WELL, TOO BAD, THEN.
YOU IN, YOU OUT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
DAYMOND?
IT'S A LITTLE...
AND SO, I'M OUT.
MARTIN, WHEN I LOOK AT
HOW PEOPLE EAT,
INCLUDING MYSELF
AND MY FAMILY,
I THINK THAT PEOPLE DON'T
EAT ALL THEIR FOOD
AT HOME
NEAR THE SmartPlate.
THEY HAVE LUNCH AT SCHOOL.
THEY HAVE LUNCH ON THE RUN.
THEY EAT AT A RESTAURANT
AT NIGHT.
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND
A LOT TIME AND MONEY
TRYING TO SELL
THESE PLATES TO PEOPLE,
AND I DON'T REALLY THINK
THEY HAVE ANY MERIT AT ALL.
I'M OUT.
HERE'S WHERE
I'M KIND OF GOING IN CIRCLES.
I DON'T SEE ANY TECHNOLOGY
THAT YOU GUYS INTRODUCED.
THIS IS
A TECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCT.
Dell'Arciprete:
MM-HMM. THAT'S CORRECT.
YOU'VE SOLD IT AS SUCH,
RIGHT?
YES.
IT IS.
YOU'RE TRYING
TO SELL THE VALUE,
AND WHAT I'M HEARING
IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION,
THE CORE COMPETENCY,
YOU'RE HIRING FROM
THIRD-PARTY DESIGN COMPANIES,
AND YOU'RE HOPING
THEY CAN MAKE IT WORK.
THEY'RE EXPERIENCED
IN THE SPACE.
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?
YOU'RE BETTING
YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY
ON SOME
EXTERNAL DESIGN COMPANY.
YOU GUYS CAN'T CONTROL
YOUR OWN DESTINY.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER
OR NOT THIS STUFF IS
EVEN GOING TO WORK.
THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM
FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
AS A TECHNOLOGIST,
I THINK
THE PLATE IS A CRUTCH.
I THINK
IT'S AN INTERIM STEP
THAT WILL BE OBSOLETE
SOON ENOUGH.
IF YOUR PHOTO-RECOGNITION
TECHNOLOGY
WERE AS GOOD
AS IT SHOULD BE,
THEN IT CAN INFER
VOLUME AND MASS
FROM THE PICTURE
IT TAKES.
I DON'T NEED TO WEIGH
THE PIZZA.
I DON'T NEED TO TAKE AN
ANCILLARY PHOTO FROM THE SIDE.
SO, YOU'RE TRYING
TO SELL PEOPLE
A VERY EXPENSIVE,
VERY FRAGILE, HARD THING
THAT DOESN'T FIT
IN THEIR POCKET,
THAT CAN'T GO
WITH THEM ANYWHERE,
AND YOU'RE CHARGING
A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT.
THERE'S SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS
THIS BUSINESS FAILS
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
BARBARA?
CAN I JUST MAKE ONE -- CAN I
MAKE A QUICK POINT, BARBARA?
CERTAINLY, GO AHEAD.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
BARBARA, I KNOW THAT
YOU HAVE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS
IN THE FOOD SPACE.
YES, I DO.
A LOT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO
IS IN THIS SPACE.
THERE'S CONSUMERS
THAT ARE OUT THERE,
AND THEY'RE DOING ALL THIS
MANUALLY.
YES.
WE AUTOMATE THAT --
WE AUTOMATE THAT PROCESS.
I FEEL SO BADLY,
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO HEARTFELT.
YET, YOUR PRESENTATION
REALLY WAS JUST TERRIBLE.
I'M SORRY TO SAY.
JUST TERRIBLE.
AND CONFUSING.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
Cuban:
GOOD LUCK, MARTIN.
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I APPRECIATE IT.
IT WAS TOUGH.
YOU KNOW, THEY FIRED
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO KEEP
MY PASSION POINTS THERE.
I TRIED TO WALK THEM
THROUGH THE BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW, BUT IT WAS --
IT WAS A TOUGH DAY.
BUT, HONESTLY, YOU KNOW,
WE STILL BELIEVE IN SmartPlate
AND THE IMPACT THAT IT CAN HAVE
FOR CONSUMERS.
ALL I WANT RIGHT NOW
IS SOME STREET MEAT
WITH SOME
SOFT-SERVE ICE CREAM.
