I'M KATIE SANCHEZ.
AND I'M MELISSA ELMS.
AND OUR COMPANY IS BASED
IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA.
I'M ALWAYS KNOWN
MY WAY AROUND A KITCHEN.
I'M A TRAINED PASTRY CHEF.
SO TRYING NEW RECIPES,
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE.
WOW.
PERFECT.
I MET KATIE
AT A FOOD TRADE SHOW,
AND WE DECIDED TO STICK TOGETHER
AND BECOME BUSINESS PARTNERS.
pH OF 3.7.
OUR PRODUCT
IS A SWEETENER
THAT TASTES AND BAKES
LIKE TRADITIONAL HONEY,
BUT WHAT MAKES IT
REALLY GREAT
IS IT STEMS
FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE.
OUR GOAL IS
TO HELP SAVE THE BEES.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE POPULATION
OF THESE TINY WORKERS
IS IN DECLINE.
OUR PRODUCT HELPS
TO GIVE THE BEES A BREAK,
ALLOWS THEM TO REGAIN IN HEALTH
AND IN NUMBERS.
WE'LL GET THAT ORDER
RIGHT OUT TO YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'VE PUT EVERYTHING
INTO THIS BUSINESS --
SPIRITUALLY, EMOTIONALLY,
AND FINANCIALLY.
THIS BUSINESS
IS SO IMPORTANT
'CAUSE IT'S GOING TO MAKE A
CHANGE IN THE SWEETENER MARKET,
AND IT OFFERS A SOLUTION
TO MULTIPLE PROBLEMS,
NOT JUST TODAY,
BUT FOR TOMORROW, AS WELL.
MY NAME'S KATIE SANCHEZ,
AND I'M FROM MINNEAPOLIS,
MINNESOTA.
AND I'M MELISSA ELMS,
FROM NOLANVILLE, TEXAS.
AND WE ARE THE OWNERS
AND OPERATORS
OF BEE FREE HONEE.
WE ARE HERE SEEKING $100,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, WE'VE ALL HEARD
THE EXPRESSION "BUSY AS A BEE."
THEY'RE BUSY FOR A REASON.
IT TAKES OVER 60,000 BEES
TO GATHER ENOUGH NECTAR
FOR ONE POUND OF HONEY.
WOW.
WELL,
WE AT BEE FREE HONEE SAY,
LET'S GIVE THOSE BEES
A REST.
THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE OUR LINE
OF 100%-PLANT-BASED,
SUSTAINABLE HONEY.
NO HIVES REQUIRED.
HOW DO WE DO IT?
BEE FREE IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE
HONEY ON THE MARKET...
...MADE FROM APPLES.
WE MAKE ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS
IN OUR KITCHEN
USING ONLY APPLES
GROWN IN THE U.S.A.
BEE FREE HONEE
CAN BE USED ON BREADS,
AS A TOPPING ON GRANOLAS
OR OATMEALS.
YOU CAN USE BEE FREE HONEE
AS THE PERFECT SUBSTITUTE.
SHARKS, WE INVITE YOU
TO ENJOY BEE FREE HONEE
SO YOU CAN SEE
WHAT ALL THE "BUZZ" IS ABOUT.
WE HAVE SOME SAMPLES.
YOU CAN GRAB EITHER ONE.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
SO, WHAT YOU HAVE
IN FRONT OF YOU,
IT'S 80% U.S.-GROWN
ORGANIC APPLE.
LEMON JUICE IS
THE ONLY PRESERVATIVE.
AND THEN THERE'S A TITCH
OF VEGAN-QUALITY
NON-GMO CANE SUGAR.
ONLY ENOUGH TO GIVE IT
THE VISCOSITY
OF TRADITIONAL HONEY.
AND THOSE ARE
THE THREE MAIN INGREDIENTS.
IT TASTES GOOD, GUYS.
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
IT TASTES LIKE HONEY.
THIS STUFF IS
VERY, VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
O'Leary: SO, KATIE, CAN I JUST
ASK YOU A BASIC QUESTION
BEFORE WE GET INTO
AND DIVE DEEP INTO THIS?
SURE.
WHY DOES
THE WORLD NEED THIS?
Elms: NOT ONLY DOES IT HELP
WITH THE BEE POPULATION,
BUT OUR VEGAN COMMUNITY
IS A BIG SUPPORTER OF OURS.
VEGANS DO NOT EAT HONEY?
VEGANS DO NOT EAT HONEY.
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
CONTESTED INGREDIENTS
IN THE VEGAN COMMUNITY
BY FAR.
WHY?
IT COMES FROM AN ANIMAL,
AN INSECT.
John:
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY CAME ON HERE
LAST SEASON -- BEE THINKING.
I TOOK
ONE OF THE HIVES HOME,
AND I'VE BECOME NOW ABSOLUTELY,
TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH BEES.
I HAVE A MILLION BEES
ON MY PROPERTY.
AND I JUST KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THIS STUFF NOW.
IF YOU TAKE OUT MORE
THAN ABOUT 20% OF THE HONEY,
IT COULD
COLLAPSE THE HIVE.
WHERE DOES THIS COMPARE PRICING
TO HONEY?
Elms: IT'S AT THE SAME PRICE
OR LOWER,
BUT IT COST US TO PRODUCE
$1.60 A UNIT.
AND WE SELL IT FOR $5.99
A BOTTLE AT RETAIL.
AND IS THAT
WHAT I WOULD PAY
FOR ANOTHER JAR OF HONEY,
OR WHAT EXACTLY?
YOU'D PROBABLY PAY
AROUND $10.99 AND UP.
WOW.
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
SO, WE'VE BEEN ON THE NATIONAL
MARKET NOW FOR TWO YEARS.
WE ARE IN 9 OF THE 11 REGIONS
OF WHOLE FOODS.
OUR SALES ARE THIS YEAR TO DATE
$104,000 IN REVENUE STREAM.
LAST YEAR, $78,000,
OUR FIRST YEAR
OUT OF THE GATE.
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS
COMPANY IS WORTH $1 MILLION?
WELL, WE'VE JUST
FINISHED TESTING
WITH COSTCO IN THE BAY AREA,
AS WELL,
AND WE ARE GOING -- WE'RE
WORKING ON PACKAGING RIGHT NOW
FOR A ROLL-OUT WITH THEM
THIS LATE FALL.
IF YOU WERE TO GET YOUR
INVESTMENT TODAY OF $100,000,
IS THAT ENOUGH MONEY
TO CASH FLOW THOSE ORDERS?
YES.
YES. YOU FEEL SO.
YOU'VE DONE THE NUMBERS?
Sanchez: WE PUT EVERYTHING
BACK INTO THE COMPANY.
YEAH, THE $100,000
IS GONNA BE FOR US
TO BUILD
OUR OWN KITCHEN.
YOU HAVE NEED
FOR A LARGER KITCHEN
TO GET THOSE OTHER ORDERS?
YES, MA'AM.
WE HAVE
CAP ON OUR SALES
BECAUSE WE HAVE A CAP
ON PRODUCTION HOURS.
SO, I'VE GOT
A COUPLE OF RESTAURANTS.
IF I TAKE THIS TO MY CHEF
AND SAY,
"CHEF, DO YOU WANT TO USE THIS
IN YOUR PASTRIES?"
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE
TO BEAT THAT
TO WHERE YOU ARE A CHEAPER,
JUST-AS-DELICIOUS COMMODITY?
IF YOUR CHEF IS USING
ORGANIC, LOCAL HONEY,
THEN OUR PRODUCT'S GONNA BE
OBVIOUSLY LOWER-PRICED.
WHAT IF THEY'RE USING, LIKE,
JUST HONEY OFF THE TRUCK?
OURS IS GONNA BE
RELATIVELY THE SAME PRICE.
WELL,
THAT'S NO GOOD, CHRIS.
THAT'S NO GOOD.
IF THEY BUY IN BULK.
YEAH,
BUT THAT'S IRRELEVANT.
IT <i>IS</i> RELEVANT!
IF I WALK INTO A GROCERY STORE
WITH MY KIDS,
AND IT SAYS "BUY THIS,
SAVE THE LIVES OF 1,000 BEES,"
THIS IS
A $100 MILLION BRAND.
UGH.
WHY NOT SAY YOU'RE GONNA SAVE
THE UNBORN BABY WHALES
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?
YOU KNOW, LADIES,
I, UH, I DON'T GET --
UH,
I DON'T GET THE WHOLE THING.
HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING THIS?
I STARTED THE -- I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE APPLE JELLY,
AND I DIDN'T READ
THE DIRECTIONS,
AND I WOUND UP
MAKING THIS BY ACCIDENT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT ON.
AND THAT HAPPENED IN 1999.
AND THEN,
WHEN I STARTED HEARING ABOUT --
1999 -- SO 15 YEARS AGO.
BUT I DIDN'T START WORKING ON
THIS AS A PRODUCT IN 1999.
THAT'S WHEN
THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'VE MADE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS
IN 15 YEARS.
I'M REALLY EXCITED
FOR YOU.
I'M GOING TO ALLOW BARBARA
TO GIVE YOU HER GOOD MONEY,
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I LIKE THE FACT
THAT YOUR PRODUCT
IS WRAPPED AROUND A CAUSE --
SAVE THE BEES.
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU DELIVER THE CAUSE
WITH YOUR PACKAGING.
Cuban: NO, THEY DON'T AT ALL.
YOU DON'T COME CLOSE.
RIGHT.
'CAUSE "BEE FREE"
JUST SAYS
IT'S, YOU KNOW, HONEY
THAT'S NOT MADE FORM BEES.
John: IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT
SOME KIND OF LABELING ON IT
THAT WILL SAY
HOW MANY BEES IT WILL SAVE,
PLUS CONTRIBUTE MONEY TOWARD
SOME FORM OF BEE EDUCATION --
IT COULD BE
25 CENTS A BOTTLE --
I WOULD GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 25%,
AND WE CAN HAVE A DEAL
RIGHT NOW.
WHAT?
YEAH, DON'T DO THAT YET.
DON'T DO THAT YET.
YEAH.
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT
ALL THESE SHARKS
LYING IN WAIT RIGHT NOW.
[ BLOWS ]
I'M ABOUT TO WARM THIS UP.
COME ON.
LOOK, ALL RIGHT.
I'VE BEEN LYING IN WAIT
OVER HERE.
I HAVE A COUPLE SECRETS.
ONE -- I WAS VEGAN
FOR A LONG TIME.
AWESOME.
SO, I AM AN INVESTOR
IN THE FASTEST-GROWING FAST,
CASUAL RESTAURANT IN AMERICA,
WHICH IS VEGGIE GRILL --
A PLANT-BASED RESTAURANT
THAT IS KICKING ASS AND
TAKING NAMES ALL OVER AMERICA.
WHY? BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP
AND INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS,
AND THE INGREDIENTS
THEY WANT TO SOURCE
ARE THOSE THAT COMPLY
WITH A PLANT-BASED STAFF,
BUT ARE CHEAP ENOUGH THAT
THERE'S STILL MARGIN FOR THEM.
NOW, THE MILLION BUCKS,
I THINK,
IS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRETCH FOR
WHERE YOU ARE IN TERMS OF SALES.
THAT SAID,
I DO WORRY THAT 100 GRAND
ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY
FOR YOU.
I ACTUALLY THINK YOU NEED
MORE THAN $100,000.
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.
MELISSA AND KATIE HAVE ONE OFFER
ON THE TABLE FROM DAYMOND --
$100,000 FOR 25% OF THEIR HONEY
ALTERNATIVE, BEE FREE HONEE,
BUT OTHER SHARKS ARE CIRCLING.
I ACTUALLY THINK YOU NEED MORE
THAN $100,000.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $200,000
FOR 30% OF YOUR COMPANY.
I'LL MATCH THAT --
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000 FOR 15%
OR $200,000 FOR 30%.
O'Leary:
SO, YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
CHRIS IS
A RAVING CAPITALIST,
DOESN'T GIVE A [BLEEP]
ABOUT THE BEES.
DAYMOND OVER HERE IS
VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE BEES.
AND MARK'S MADE THIS WHOLE THING
UP, AND WHILE HE'S AT IT,
HE COULD SAVE GIRAFFES WITH
THIS PRODUCT -- WHO KNOWS?
I'M HAPPY TO LET SOMEBODY IN
FOR A PART OF THE DEAL
IF THEY WANT TO GO WAVE THE FLAG
ABOUT THE BEE BUSINESS,
BUT WHAT MAKES THIS BIG IS THAT
YOU ARE BETTER AND CHEAPER.
THIS OFFER'S EVEN BETTER.
IT'S EVEN SWEETER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 10% OF THE BUSINESS.
BUT I WILL THEN DO
20% OF THE ONLINE SALES,
AND I'LL RUN THAT
FOR YOU.
IT TAKES THAT PART
OF THE BUSINESS OFF THE TABLE,
AND THEN YOU KEEP
MORE EQUITY.
BARBARA, ARE YOU IN OR OUT?
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL TAKE THE WHOLE DEAL
OR HALF THE DEAL,
BUT I'M THE PARTNER
YOU WANT.
GUYS, LOOK,
I LIKE TO ALWAYS PUT MYSELF
IN THE SHOES
OF THE ENTREPRENEUR.
AS SOON AS I FINISH...
WAIT. BARBARA. I'M GONNA CIRCLE
BACK TO YOU, BARBARA.
I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT BARBARA SAID.
I'M GONNA
COME BACK TO YOU.
I'M NOT GONNA
LEAVE YOU HANGING.
OKAY, GUYS,
YOU NEED CHRIS FOR COMMERCIAL.
IT REALLY BENEFITS YOU
TO HAVE IT IN HIS RESTAURANT --
THAT ACCELERATES IT,
AND IT GIVES YOU
A COOLNESS FACTOR, AS WELL.
BARBARA YOU NEED
FOR THE HAND-HOLDING, RIGHT?
YOU DON'T NEED ME
FOR THE HAND-HOLDING.
YOU NEED ME
FOR BUILDING YOUR BRAND,
LIKE I BUILT
PORK BARREL BBQ SAUCE...
MM-HMM.
DAISY CAKES,
TOM AND CHEE, COUSINS,
...ALL DOING
AN EXCESS OF $10 MILLION,
AND THEY STARTED
WITH LESS THAN $200,000.
YOU NEED ME
FOR MY FOOD EXPERTISE
AND MY MARKETING
EXPERTISE.
ARE YOU WILLING
TO GO IN TOGETHER?
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN ASKING HER
TO CLEAR --
TURNS OUT, BY THE WAY,
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA, TOO.
I WOULD RATHER HAVE
MARK AS MY PARTNER,
BECAUSE HE'S A LOT
BETTER-LOOKING
THAN THIS COWBOY
ON THE LEFT.
[ Laughing ]
OH, MY GOODNESS!
BARBARA, I THINK
WE'D BENEFIT WITH CHRIS IN.
RIGHT?
WELL, OKAY.
SO, THREE SHARKS...
YEAH, THREE FOR THREE.
...AND YOU GET
TO BEE LOVING.
Sacca: WAIT,
I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD --
BARBARA SAID, "HALF THE DEAL,"
"ALL THE DEAL" --
WHAT'S THE DEAL?
NO, NO.
I WAS GOING TO TAKE
HALF OF YOUR DEAL
IF YOU WANTED ME TO.
WAIT -- HALF OF MY DEAL,
BUT WITHOUT ME?
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'D PREFER IT.
DUDE,
I COPYWRITED THAT DEAL.
SO, CHRIS OFFERED
$200,000 FOR 30%.
WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST
IS $210,000 FOR 30% --
$70,000 FROM EACH OF US,
10% FOR EACH OF US.
YOU'LL GET
OUR EXPERTISE.
I LIKE THAT A LOT.
I COULD TAKE OVER
THE WEBSITE.
I'VE GOT
ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
I'LL TAKE OVER
THE GROCERY END.
WAIT. AM I ALLOWED BACK
INTO MY OWN DEAL?
NO.
I'M ASKING YOU RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S A THREE-WAY.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME BACK
INTO MY OWN DEAL.
[ SANCHEZ LAUGHS ]
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR --
$210,000...
FOR 30%.
...FOR 30% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
SO $70,000 FROM EACH,
BASICALLY, 10 POINTS EACH?
RIGHT. CORRECT.
IMAGINE YOUR CONFERENCE CALL
WITH THESE GUYS.
[ ELMS AND SANCHEZ LAUGH ]
BUT WHAT HAPPENS, THEN,
WHEN YOU NEED A REAL PARTNER?
SHARKS,
YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.
HEY, YEAH!
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS GONNA BE A BIG HUG.
NO-BRAINER!
[ LAUGHS ]
SWEET!
THANK YOU.
OH, MY GOSH!
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
WOW. THANK YOU.
THAT STUFF IS DELICIOUS.
OH, MY GOSH.
Corcoran: MY PLEASURE.
OH, WE WANTED TO WORK
WITH YOU ALL SO MUCH.
TERRIFIC JOB.
THAT STUFF IS SO DELICIOUS.
Sanchez:
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
THANK YOU!
APPRECIATE IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ Laughing ]
OH, MY GOD!
Sanchez: WE WENT
DEEP-SEA FISHING,
AND WE CAUGHT THREE SHARKS!
THREE SHARKS!
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
Narrator: IN SEASON 5,
MARK CUBAN INVESTED
IN AN APP-CONTROLLED
SMART-LIGHT BULB CALLED ILUMI.
YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.
I KNEW IT!
LET'S GO TO WORK!
Narrator: LET'S SEE
HOW ILUMI IS DOING NOW.
