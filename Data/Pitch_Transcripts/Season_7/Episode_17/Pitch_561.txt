MY NAME IS KRISTI ISON,
AND I AM THE PROUD FOUNDER
AND SOLE OWNER OF FLOAT BABY.
TODAY, I AM SEEKING $150,000
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
SHARKS, WE ALL KNOW THAT
PEOPLE WHO EXERCISE WEEKLY
HAVE IMPROVED PHYSICAL
AND COGNITIVE STRENGTH.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE
WHO HAVE ROUTINE MASSAGES
CAN EXPERIENCE IMPROVED
BLOOD FLOW AND MUSCLE TONE.
FLOAT BABY
IS THE FIRST AND ONLY
FLOATATION AND MASSAGE FACILITY
IN THE U.S. FOR BABIES.
BABIES AS YOUNG AS TWO WEEKS USE
HYDROTHERAPY AND INFANT MASSAGE
TO BECOME HAPPIER AND --
BELIEVE IT OR NOT --
STRONGER, SMARTER BABIES.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ LAUGHTER CONTINUES ]
SORRY, SORRY.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ Laughing ] I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
[ LAUGHTER CONTINUES ]
OH, MY GOD.
Sacca:
YOU'RE SERIOUS?
AFTER FLOATING BABIES
OVER 1,000 TIMES,
I ASSURE YOU
THIS IS A PROVEN CONCEPT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, RATHER THAN SWIM
WITH THE SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO FLOAT
WITH THE BABIES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO'S PROVEN
THAT THIS WORKS?
YEAH, YOU MADE
AN AWFUL LOT OF CLAIMS.
I DID.
WHERE ARE THOSE
BACKED UP?
IT'S VALIDATED
BY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES.
THIS IS NOT A NEW --
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER.
OKAY.
THAT MEANS NOTHING.
CAN YOU POINT TO ANY RESEARCH
THAT SHOWS
THAT BABIES WHO FLOAT
OR ARE MASSAGED
HAVE BETTER
HEALTH OUTCOMES?
YOU EVEN SAID
COGNITIVE OUTCOMES, TOO.
YES.
INFANT MASSAGE IS DONE ACROSS
THE U.S. IN HOSPITAL N.I.C.U.s
FOR PREMATURE BABIES TO HELP
STIMULATE THE GROWTH HORMONE...
SURE.
...HELP THEM EAT BETTER,
GROW FASTER.
THE LARGEST STUDY
ON EARLY WATER PROGRAMS
WAS DONE BY GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY
OUT OF AUSTRALIA.
AND THEY LOOKED AT
7,000 CHILDREN UNDER AGE 5.
AND THEY FOUND THAT THE BABIES
WHO WERE IN THE WATER PROGRAM
John:
SO, KRISTI, I JUST WANT TO KNOW,
WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON
TO SNAP A HEMORRHOID PILLOW
AROUND A BABY'S NECK
AND FLOAT THEM
DOWN THE RIVER?
[ LAUGHS ]
LIKE,
WHO STARTED THIS CONCEPT?
THIS WAS STARTED IN JAPAN
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.
THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPANIES
THAT MAKE THIS FLOATATION RING.
I HAVE A PATENT PENDING
ON THE COVER.
IT'S SMALLER THAN ANY OF
THE EXISTING FLOATATION DEVICES
ON THE MARKET.
WE COULD START SEEING BABIES
AS EARLY AS 2 WEEKS.
SO,
EXPLAIN TO ME THE BUSINESS.
IS THE BUSINESS, YOU KNOW,
A LOCATION?
SO, WE HAVE A STORE FRONT.
EACH BABY HAS
THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TUB.
I HAVE THREE CURRENTLY,
SO WE RUN THREE BABIES
PER CLASS.
THEY FLOAT FOR ABOUT
20 TO 25 MINUTES.
HOW MUCH IS 1 HOUR?
1 HOUR IS $65.
ALL RIGHT.
WHEW.
IF I WANTED TO START
MR. WONDERFUL'S FLOAT-A-TRON,
I COULD DO IT.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU HAVE --
NO ONE WOULD BRING THEIR BABY
TO YOU, KEVIN.
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
O'Leary: I MEAN,
THE WHOLE POINT IS,
YOU COULD HAVE COMPETITION
NEXT DOOR RIGHT AWAY.
THIS IS LIKE A NAIL SALON,
ISN'T IT?
IT IS NOT A NAIL SALON.
WHY NOT?
FOR ONE REASON,
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I'M HERE.
I NEED DEEPER TUBS.
CURRENTLY, I AM HAVING
TO GRADUATE MY CLIENTS
PREMATURELY AT 6 MONTHS,
BECAUSE OF THE DEPTH
OF MY TUBS.
I'VE LOCATED
A MANUFACTURER IN CHINA
THAT MAKES SPECIFIC TUBS
FOR THIS.
THEY'RE BABY SPA TUBS.
WHAT WERE YOUR TOTAL SALES
OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS?
$44,000 THE FIRST YEAR,
AND WE ARE ON TRACK
TO DO $60,000 THIS YEAR.
OKAY, SO YOU'RE NOT SELLING OUT
ALL YOUR TIME SLOTS RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT.
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE
RIGHT HERE.
THAT'S MY SECOND CHALLENGE,
WHICH IS --
THAT'S
YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE.
THAT'S MY FIRST CHALLENGE.
BECAUSE
IF YOU SELL ENOUGH,
THEN YOU CREATE ALL THE DOLLARS
YOU NEED FOR YOUR TUB.
THAT'S TRUE.
YEAH, I KNOW IT IS.
UM...
John: SO MAYBE THAT'S
A DIFFERENT QUESTION.
IN THE WORLD OF DIGITAL
MARKETING,
I THINK THAT THINGS
SHOULD BE GOING VIRAL.
I MEAN, YOU CAN GO
TO THE "MOMMY AND ME" CLASS,
YOU CAN GO TO LITTLE MOMS
ON FACEBOOK.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
SO WHERE DO YOU STAND
ON THAT AREA?
THERE ARE IS SO MUCH MONEY
BEING SPENT IN THIS SPACE.
BUT I WANTED TO KNOW --
ARE YOU STRONG IN
MARKETING IN THAT AREA?
IS SOCIAL MEDIA
MY STRONG POINT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
IT CAN BE.
THIS THING SHOULD GO VIRAL
AT THIS POINT, ALL RIGHT?
LOOK, KRISTI, I'M GONNA ASK YOU
A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION.
OKAY.
WHAT'S YOUR GRIND?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
LOOK,
HERE'S WHAT I'M SAYING --
THE GRIND IS, YOU GOT
TO GET OUT THERE AND SELL.
YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR OWN DESTINY
BY GRINDING --
MEANING YOU'RE GOING TO
THE "MOMMY AND ME" CLASSES.
HERE'S A CARD, HERE'S A FLYER,
HERE'S WHATEVER.
YOU'RE GOING
TO WHEREVER MOMS ARE,
AND SAYING, "HERE'S A COUPON"
AND THEY CAN COME FOR FREE.
THAT'S A GRIND -- GOING OUT
THERE AND GETTING IN YOUR CAR
AND GRINDING AND GOING
AND SELLING.
MY BACKGROUND IS
IN MEDICAL-DEVICE SALES.
I'VE WORKED FOR STARTUP
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES
FOR 18 YEARS.
SO, THEN YOU KNOW
TO GO OUT THERE AND SELL.
SO I <i>DO</i> KNOW
HOW TO GO AND SELL,
AND IN BETWEEN THOSE CLASSES
WHERE I DON'T HAVE BABIES,
I AM MEETING WITH DOCTORS,
I AM MEETING WITH PEDIATRIC PTs.
THEN SOMETHING IS WRONG.
RIGHT?
SOMETHING MISSING.
IS THAT YIELDING BUSINESS?
ARE YOU SEEING THAT
PRODUCE RESULTS?
Ison: IT IS YIELDING BUSINESS
BUT THIS IS A BUSINESS
THAT IS BUILDING, AND --
IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE IT'S BUILDING.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I'M LOOKING AT
YOUR BUSINESS,
AND I CAN'T SEE
THE THING
THAT YOU ARE
UNIQUELY AMAZING AT.
I SEE THIS AS A BUSINESS
FOR YOU INDIVIDUALLY,
BUT I DON'T SEE IT
AS SOMETHING BIG,
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
John: YOU KNOW, IN BUSINESS
THERE ARE THE FUNDAMENTALS --
PURELY THE FUNDAMENTALS.
MONEY'S NOT GONNA
SOLVE ANYTHING.
MONEY JUST DRIVES YOU UP
TO YOUR PROBLEMS IN A BUGATTI.
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS TELL
EVERYBODY.
YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IS THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT TO
EVERYBODY IN A VERY SAVVY WAY --
CREATE A TRIBE,
CREATE A FOLLOWING
TO COME TO YOU
AND UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING OF VALUE
FOR EVERYBODY.
I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU
THAT I ABSOLUTELY NEED HELP
WITH THAT.
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEED TO DO YOURSELF.
SO...
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I THINK YOU ARE
A GREAT PRACTITIONER,
AND REALLY BELIEVE
IN YOUR PRODUCT.
BUT THERE IS ONE THING
THAT EVERY ENTREPRENEUR
THAT I'VE INVESTED IN
HAS IN COMMON,
IS TREMENDOUS ENERGY
AND TREMENDOUS HUSTLE.
SO, I THINK YOU NEED
A SALESMAN/HUSTLER AS
A BUSINESS PARTNER,
OR ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THIS IS
A LOVELY PERSONAL PRACTICE.
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK
IT'S INVESTABLE.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
O'Leary: KRISTI,
I HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
I LAUGHED HEARTILY AT THE VIDEO
'CAUSE IT'S FUNNY,
BUT I BOUGHT INTO THE MERITS.
OKAY, I BELIEVE IT.
IF YOU'D COME IN HERE
AND SAID TO ME,
"LOOK, I'M GONNA USE
THE 'SHARK TANK' PLATFORM
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW
THAT THIS EXISTS,
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO SELL THEM THE DOUGHNUT.
AND MY DOUGHNUT'S BETTER
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PROVEN,
AND I'VE REDESIGNED
THE CHOKE COLLAR --
OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT.
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO ORDER ONE
FOR $69.95."
HE'S RIGHT.
WHO CARES ABOUT
A BABY SPA?
IT'S IRRELEVANT.
YOU CANT LEVERAGE THAT.
IT'S GREAT FOR YOU.
OKAY.
BUT HOW DO I, AS AN INVESTOR,
AFTER GIVING YOU $150,000,
MAKE $1 MILLION,
MAKE $2 MILLION,
MAKE $5 MILLION?
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THAT FEEDBACK.
WE DID CONSIDER
SELLING THE RINGS.
WE THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD BE...
AND THE TUBS.
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA SELL THEM
TO PEOPLE FOR THEIR HOME USE.
WHY NOT?
WHY NOT?
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT YOU MISSED?
DON'T YOU DESERVE
TO BE PUNISHED?
[ Chuckling ] NO!
OF COURSE YOU DO.
I NEED HELP.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
WELL, LOOK...
I'VE PROVEN THE CONCEPT,
PEOPLE ARE COMING...
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IN
THE ADVICE
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN.
THIS IS NOT
THE "ADVICE TANK."
IT'S AN INVESTORS
OPPORTUNITY.
I DON'T SEE ANY CHANCE
OF MAKING MONEY WITH YOU.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
WITH IT BEING
A BRAND-NEW CONCEPT IN THE U.S.,
IT'S VERY EASY
TO SIT BACK AND SAY,
"YOU SHOULD'VE DONE THIS,
YOU SHOULD'VE DONE THAT."
I'M GONNA KEEP DOING
WHAT I'M DOING.
THE PARENTS LOVE
WHAT I'M DOING.
AND I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE
THE NEXT BIG THING.
I JUST WANT TO SEE THAT VIDEO
ONE MORE TIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, THAT IS FUNNY.
Narrator:
NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A HIGH-TECH SOLUTION
TO ACHIEVE THE PERFECT FIT.
