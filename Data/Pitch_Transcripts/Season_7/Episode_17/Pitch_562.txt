HIT THEIR MILESTONE MARKERS
BY AS MUCH AS 50% AHEAD
OF THE NON-WATER GROUP.
HI.
I'M MILES PENN.
I'M HERE FROM SAN FRANCISCO,
AND I'M SEEKING $2.5 MILLION
IN EXCHANGE FOR A 10% EQUITY
STAKE IN MY COMPANY, MTailor.
AS A GUY, I HATE GOING TO
THE MALL AND TRYING ON CLOTHES.
BUT ONLINE SHOPPING
IS EVEN WORSE,
BECAUSE I'LL ORDER FIVE SHIRTS
JUST TO GET ONE THAT FITS OKAY.
CUSTOM CLOTHING PROVIDES
THE PERFECT FIT,
BUT IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE,
AND IT'S EVEN MORE OF A HASSLE
THAN REGULAR SHOPPING.
UNTIL NOW.
MTailor SELLS
MEN'S CUSTOM SHIRTS
BY MEASURING YOU
WITH YOUR PHONE'S CAMERA.
AND WE'RE 20% MORE ACCURATE
THAN A PROFESSIONAL TAILOR.
IN THE MTailor APP,
THERE ARE OVER 10,000
UNIQUE SHIRT COMBINATIONS,
BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY SIMPLE
TO ORDER.
LET'S ORDER THE SHIRT
I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW.
YOU START BY PICKING OUT
YOUR FABRIC.
I LIKE THIS HEAVY PURPLE OXFORD,
WHICH IS A NICE, CASUAL FABRIC.
NEXT,
YOU PICK OUT YOUR COLLAR.
WE'LL GO WITH
A CASUAL BUTTON-DOWN.
NEXT IS YOUR CUFF.
YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG
WITH A ONE-BUTTON ROUND.
NOW, HERE IS
AN MTailor SPECIALTY --
TUCKED VERSUS UNTUCKED.
YOU WON'T FIND
"TUCKED" AND "UNTUCKED" OPTIONS
AT FUBU SHIRTS IN STORES.
WOW.
HE JUST WENT THERE,
DAYMOND.
OHHH.
NOT A GOOD WAY
TO START A PITCH. GO AHEAD.
BUT NOW WE GET
TO THE REAL SECRET SAUCE,
WHICH IS GETTING MEASURED
BY YOUR PHONE'S CAMERA.
THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS
IS INCREDIBLY EASY,
AND IT TAKES
LESS THAN 30 SECONDS.
AND DAVID HERE WILL SHOW US
HOW EASY IT REALLY IS.
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS CHANGE
INTO FORM-FITTING CLOTHING,
WHICH DAVID'S ALREADY DONE.
NEXT, YOU FIND A WALL YOU
CAN LEAN YOUR DEVICE AGAINST.
SO,
AS YOU PUT YOUR DEVICE DOWN,
THE LEVEL TELLS YOU
WHICH WAY TO LEAN IT.
ONCE IT TURNS GREEN,
YOU'RE READY TO STAND BACK
AND GET INTO POSITION.
AND THEN YOU DO
A SINGLE SPIN.
AND AFTER HE'S DONE SPINNING,
HE HOPS OFF-SCREEN
SO THE CAMERA CAN TAKE A PICTURE
OF THE BACKGROUND.
AND THEN YOU'RE DONE.
YOU HIT "SUBMIT."
DAVID JUST GOT MEASURED
20% MORE ACCURATELY
THAN A PROFESSIONAL TAILOR
IN UNDER 30 SECONDS.
AND BECAUSE WE CUT OUT
THE TIME-CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE
IN-PERSON MEASUREMENT PROCESS,
A CUSTOM SHIRT
THAT NORMALLY COSTS $125,
WE CAN SELL FOR $69
FOR A QUALITY, CUSTOM SHIRT.
LET'S SEE HOW DAVID'S SHIRT
CAME OUT.
[ LAUGHS ]
WOW, THAT WAS FAST.
LOOKING GREAT, DAVID.
THANK YOU.
SHARKS,
WE'VE ALREADY LAUNCHED
AND ARE THRIVING
ON BOTH iOS AND ANDROID.
SO, SHARKS,
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR
AND STOP WEARING
ANOTHER MAN'S CLOTHING.
THANK YOU.
[ SIGHS ]
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT...
VERY NICE.
...THIS SHIRT HERE.
BARBARA, STOP WEARING
ANOTHER MAN'S CLOTHING.
OKAY.
HE'S GOT A HUNKY SHAPE ON HIM.
I LIKE HIS ARMS.
DID IT ACTUALLY MEASURE
HIS BICEPS?
Penn: YES.
REALLY?
SO, WE USE OVER 14 MEASUREMENTS
IN EACH SHIRT.
O'Leary:
THE MEASURING TECHNOLOGY,
IS THERE ANYTHING
PROPRIETARY THERE,
OR HAVE YOU JUST TAKEN IT
OFF THE SHELF?
BECAUSE THIS EXISTS
IN OTHER FORMS.
COMPLETELY PROPRIETARY.
DEVELOPED BY ME AND ANOTHER
FRIEND OF MINE FROM STANFORD.
WHAT'S YOUR RETURN RATES?
BECAUSE THAT WOULD TELL ME
WHAT THE INACCURACY IS
IN THE MEASURING.
SURE.
OUR NET,
INCLUDING RE-MAKES,
WHICH IS WHAT
MOST OF OUR RETURNS ARE,
IS ABOUT 15%.
15%?
15% RETURNS?
YES. YOU KNOW, A TYPICAL
ONLINE FASHION STORE
HAS 25% TO 30% RETURN.
John: YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $2.5 MILLION FOR 10%,
SO YOU FEEL THERE SHOULD BE
A $25 MILLION VALUATION
ON THIS COMPANY,
CORRECT?
I'LL DEFINITELY
DISCUSS VALUATION,
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO DISCUSS.
OH, I BET YOU WILL.
OH, NO, WE DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT AT ALL TODAY.
BUT WE'LL START
WITH REVENUE.
SO, WE REALLY LAUNCHED
LAST YEAR.
THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED GETTING
SIGNIFICANT REVENUE.
AS OF JULY, WE WERE DOING
150 GRAND A MONTH IN REVENUE.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS
WE HIT SUPPLY-CHAIN ISSUES,
SO THIS PAST MONTH
WE ACTUALLY DID $130,000.
BUT WE WERE ON TRACK TO DO
$2 MILLION IN REVENUE THIS YEAR.
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'LL DO $1.1 MILLION,
'CAUSE WE HAVE TO FIX
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN.
I'M ACTUALLY FLYING TO CHINA
STARTING TOMORROW, DEFINITELY,
TO GET THAT FIXED.
O'Leary:
TALK TO US ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S A BIG HICCUP.
OH, FOR SURE.
THAT'S A 50% MISS.
YES.
BUT WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
$1.4 MILLION IN THE BANK,
SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE
NOT GOING BANKRUPT TOMORROW.
SO, WHAT EXACTLY
WAS THE PROBLEM?
YOU DIDN'T LIKE YOUR PRICING
THAT YOU WERE GETTING?
OUR PRICING,
FRANKLY, WAS --
STARTED,
WE SET UP OUR SUPPLY CHAIN,
WE WERE SELLING
TWO SHIRTS A DAY,
WE'RE PAYING THE SAME PRICE,
EVEN THOUGH WE SELL
THOUSANDS OF SHIRTS A MONTH NOW.
AND WE SPENT A FEW MONTHS
TRYING TO FIX IT.
FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, I'D NEVER
DONE SUPPLY CHAIN BEFORE.
WE HAD MOSTLY FAILED AT IT.
SO, I'M FLYING TO CHINA
AND GONNA BE THERE
INDEFINITELY UNTIL --
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THIS
AT $25 MILLION VALUATION?
BECAUSE
I CAN SAVE YOU THAT TRIP
IF YOU'LL BRING IT DOWN
TO $5 MILLION.
I COULD SEND YOU
TO TAIWAN AND CHINA
AND GIVE YOU 19 FACTORIES
THAT DO THIS THAT CAN DELIVER.
MAY I ASK YOU,
HOW MUCH DID --
SO, DAYMOND,
FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY,
...I THINK YOU REALLY COULD
BRING INCREDIBLE VALUE
TO HELPING ME
SET UP OUR SUPPLY CHAIN.
SO HE GETS A DISCOUNT?
IF THIS TECHNOLOGY'S THAT GREAT
AND I CAN HELP YOU,
WHY WOULD YOU PUT
A $25 MILLION VALUATION ON IT?
WE'VE ALREADY RAISED MONEY
AT A $10 MILLION VALUATION.
WE THINK WE'VE MADE A LOT
OF PROGRESS SINCE THEN.
OUT OF RESPECT
FOR YOUR OTHER INVESTORS --
I STILL DON'T EVEN THINK
IT'S WORTH $10 MILLION --
WHY'D YOU AT LEAST
START AT $10 MILLION?
ARE WE PLAYING A "YOU GO HIGH,
I GO LOW," THING, OR...?
OH, WE'RE JUST
A VERY DIFFERENT COMPANY
FROM WHEN
WE RAISED $10 MILLION.
YEAH, YOU'RE A COMPANY
THAT MISSED ITS NUMBERS BY 50%.
Sacca:
I GOT TO TELL YOU, I REALLY
RESPECT THE INVESTORS --
WHEN WE RAISED, WE WERE DOING
40 GRAND A MONTH IN REVENUE.
WE'RE GONNA DO 130.
THE TECHNOLOGY WE OFFER
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM ANYTHING
ANYONE HAS REALLY TRIED.
SO, YOU'RE A TECH PLAY.
DEFINITELY YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY --
BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO REBUILD
WHAT ALREADY EXISTS?
WHO WANTS
ANOTHER SHIRT COMPANY?
YEAH,
IS THIS A PROOF OF CONCEPT
TO THEN SELL THE SOFTWARE
TO OTHER PEOPLE?
IT'S NOT QUITE THAT.
WE'RE REALLY VERY FOCUSED ON
BUILDING OUR OWN BRAND.
NO ONE BEFORE US HAS
REALLY TRIED TO MAINSTREAM
CUSTOM IN THE SAME WAY.
OR YOU COULD JUST TURN AROUND
AND LICENSE THIS TECHNOLOGY
TO SOME OF THOSE
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANIES
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.
ARE YOU
A STANFORD ENGINEER?
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE
OF $25 MILLION.
STANFORD,
MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.
YEAH, OKAY.
THE SIZING TECHNOLOGY,
THE CALIBRATION YOU DID,
IS NO SMALL FEAT.
WHAT I THINK IS HARD,
PARTICULARLY FOR
A STANFORD ENGINEER, SOMETIMES,
IS REALIZING THAT TECHNOLOGY,
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE
THE EASIEST PART
OF THIS BUSINESS.
SO, I --
BUT THE REST OF THIS
IS NASTY.
BUILDING A COMPANY FROM SCRATCH,
REMOTELY FROM THE UNITED STATES,
TRYING TO GET
THE STUFF MADE,
TRYING TO SELL IT
TO REAL PEOPLE,
TRYING TO FIT
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF DIFFERENT
BODY COMBINATIONS,
DESPITE YOUR 10,000
COMBINATIONS HERE...
WELL, THAT'S JUST --
THAT'S STYLE.
...IS A HARD BUSINESS.
AND SO FAR, IT'S NOT GOING
THAT GREAT FOR YOU.
RIGHT?
I DISAGREE WITH THAT.
YOU WERE ON TRACK
TO $2 MILLION IN SALES...
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU HAD TO TAKE THE GAP --
YOU HAD
TO LET THE GAS OFF.
THE SHAPE OF YOUR CURVE
IS DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT
INSTEAD OF UP
AND TO THE RIGHT.
AND YOU'VE GOT
GOOD EXPLANATIONS FOR THAT,
BUT IT'S STILL DOWN,
RIGHT?
THAT'S ONLY
IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
SO, I WANT TO KNOW,
ARE YOUR EXISTING INVESTORS
WILLING TO INVEST
AT THIS SAME
$25 MILLION PRICE,
OR ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE SHARKS HERE?
THE HIGH VALUATION
THAT MILES CAME IN WITH
FOR HIS CUSTOM-SHIRT
TECH COMPANY, MTailor.
ARE YOUR EXISTING INVESTORS
WILLING TO INVEST
AT THE SAME
$25 MILLION PRICE,
OR ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE SHARKS HERE?
MILES, IF YOU'D SAY,
"HEY, I MADE A MISTAKE.
I'M DOING THIS.
I'M MOVING TO CHINA,
I DID THIS, DUH-DUH-DUH.
THE PROJECTIONS
WERE WRONG."
YOU'RE EXPLAINING IT AWAY,
BUT WHAT BOTHERS ME --
THERE'S NO SHAME FACTOR
AT ALL.
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
PARTY CHATTER ALMOST.
SO, MY STRESS --
I THINK I WOULD
STAY AWAKE AT NIGHT
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT YOUR
NEXT MISTAKE IS GOING TO BE.
OH, I'VE BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT CHINA.
IT'S LIKE, I HAVE --
YOU DON'T LOOK WORRIED
TO ME.
FOR THAT REASON ALONE,
I'M OUT.
AH, YOU KNOW,
CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE.
WHOA.
WELL,
I DON'T REALLY LIKE YOU...
[ LAUGHS ]
...BUT I LIKE
THE CONCEPT.
YOU CAME IN WITH
A LITTLE BIT OF ATTITUDE.
I LIKE YOU, DAYMOND.
BUT THIS IS
ALL ABOUT BUSINESS.
I'LL GIVE YOU $2.5 MILLION
FOR 17.5%.
I WANT TO LICENSE IT OUT.
I THINK WE HAVE
DIFFERENT STRATEGIC VISIONS.
I'M INTERESTED IN
FOR THE NEAR FUTURE
RAMPING UP
OUR OWN CLOTHING
AND THEN GOING AT
A MUCH HIGHER VALUATION.
SO, THANK YOU, DAYMOND.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT,
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE.
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME BACK
AND "CUSTOM-TAILOR" THIS
FOR ME IF YOU'D LIKE.
[ Laughing ] OH, GEEZ.
YOU WANT...$22.5 MILLION
POST-VALUATION, $2.5 MILLION?
AND OUR OBJECTIVE IS
TO LICENSE THIS, CORRECT?
SO, THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK
WE REALLY NEED TO DISCUSS.
WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON
THE NEAR-TERM, NOT IN LICENSING.
I THINK YOU'D REALLY --
IT WOULD POTENTIALLY
DERAIL THE COMPANY.
THAT JUST BECOMES
A REALLY BIG CHALLENGE,
BECAUSE, AT THIS POINT, I HAVE
TO LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS.
I THINK THAT WE CAN BE
GREAT STRATEGIC PARTNERS,
BUT IF I GO AND TAKE MY,
YOU KNOW, $2.5 MILLION
AND TRY TO CONCENTRATE
ON FINDING A SOFTWARE
VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS,
I CAN OWN 100%
OF WHAT I'M CURRENTLY DOING.
AND I THINK
IF YOU WANT TO GO DO THAT,
I THINK, BY ALL MEANS,
GO AHEAD.
I'M OUT.
WHAT IF I SAID TO YOU,
"LOOK, I'M INTERESTED IN YOU,
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO TO CHINA"?
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK
YOU'RE GONNA FAIL.
YOU'RE GONNA GO AND TRY
AND REINVENT THE WHEEL
MANUFACTURING SHIRTS,
WHEN REALLY
WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING
IS PERFECTING
THIS TECHNOLOGY,
TAKING OUT THAT DELAY
YOU TALKED ABOUT,
WHILE SOMEBODY WITH A REAL BRAND
AND INFRASTRUCTURE
WANTS TO WORK
WITH YOU.
[ CLEARS THROAT ] MYSELF.
I CAN HELP YOU DO THAT.
IF YOU REALLY HAVE
A BETTER MOUSETRAP,
THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $2.5 MILLION IN DEBT,
AND I WANT
2.5% OF THE COMPANY.
I WANT TO MAKE AT LEAST 7%
ON THAT DEBT, OKAY?
AH!
I'LL GIVE YOU 36 MONTHS
TO PAY IT BACK.
IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE.
YEAH, 7% A YEAR?
YEAH.
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT BAD.
YEAH, IT'S NOT BAD, YEAH.
IT'S NOT A BAD DEAL.
THAT'S THE MOST REASONABLE DEAL
I'VE EVER HEARD FROM YOU.
THAT'S VENTURE DEBT.
YOUR COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE
TO SUPPORT THAT AT THIS POINT.
SUCH A DEAL!
YOU CAN'T TURN THAT DOWN.
MARK,
DO YOU HAVE A COUNTER?
Cuban: SO,
HERE'S MY PROBLEM, RIGHT.
YOU'RE SIMILAR TO ME, BUT
EVEN MORE ARROGANT THAN I WAS,
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.
[ CORCORAN LAUGHS ]
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST
HAD MY FIRST COMPANY
AND I WROTE CODE AND I DID
ALL THE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION.
THE FACT IS THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT HAS TO GO TO CHINA.
THAT IS THE HUGEST MISTAKE
YOU'LL EVER MAKE,
BECAUSE IT SAYS
EITHER YOU'RE AFRAID
OR DON'T KNOW HOW TO HIRE
AND BUILD BENCH STRENGTH.
SO, MY PROBLEM ISN'T
THE VALUATION, RIGHT?
MY PROBLEM IS THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE THE SKILL SET YET
TO BE ABLE TO CREATE
THAT ACCELERATION.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
OKAY, MILES,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE
INTERESTED IN EQUITY PARTNERS
THAT ARE GONNA BE FULLY INVESTED
IN THE COMPANY.
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BIG
BALLOON PAYMENT OVER OUR HEADS.
WOW.
SO, UNFORTUNATELY,
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO EQUITY,
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DECLINE.
WHEN YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR,
IT'S OVER.
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME TONIGHT
AND CRY LIKE A BABY.
WHEN YOU SAY NO
TO AN OFFER LIKE THAT,
IT ACTUALLY SHOWS ME
YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
CONFIDENCE IN THE BUSINESS
AS I THOUGHT YOU DID.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
SO, I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE
IN THE BUSINESS.
I DON'T HAVE
AS MUCH CONFIDENCE
IN PAYING BACK $3 MILLION
EXACTLY WHEN HE NEEDS IT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT.
I'M SHOCKED.
I-I GOT TO SAY NO.
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
A DEAD SHIRT WALKING TO ME.
TURN AROUND
AND GET OUT OF HERE.
PLEASE JUST GO AWAY.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GUYS.
IT'S BEEN GREAT.
TAKE CARE.
