MY NAME IS BEN YOUNG.
AND MY NAME
IS GREG COLEMAN.
WE ARE HERE FROM THE WASHINGTON,
D.C., METRO AREA.
OUR COMPANY IS SWORKIT, AND
WE ARE HERE SEEKING $1.5 MILLION
IN EXCHANGE FOR
8% OF OUR COMPANY.
OH.
WOW.
SHARKS, WE ARE HERE TODAY
BECAUSE WE ARE SICK AND TIRED
OF ALL THE EXCUSES PEOPLE USE
FOR WHY THEY DON'T WORK OUT.
"I DON'T HAVE THE TIME."
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO."
"I CAN'T AFFORD A GYM."
WELL, THESE EXCUSES AND ALL
THE OTHER ONES YOU ALWAYS HEAR
END TODAY
BECAUSE SWORKIT IS HERE.
SWORKIT PROVIDES A PERSONALIZED
EXERCISE EXPERIENCE
THAT YOU CAN DO ANYWHERE
AND AT ANY TIME.
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW EASY IT IS.
FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE
A FOCUS AREA,
SUCH AS STRENGTH,
FOR EXAMPLE.
THEN YOU WANT TO CHOOSE
A WORKOUT.
I'M GONNA CHOOSE FULL BODY
RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN SELECT
THE PRECISE AMOUNT OF TIME
THAT YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE.
SWORKIT THEN CHOOSES FROM
A GROWING LIBRARY
OF INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE VIDEOS
AND MERGES THEM
INTO AN EXERCISE PLAY LIST.
IT'S LIKE SPOTIFY
BUT FOR WORKOUTS.
YOU GET A UNIQUE WORKOUT
TAILORED TO YOU,
WHERE YOU JUST FOLLOW ALONG.
IF YOU NEED AN EXTRA BREAK,
YOU CAN HIT PAUSE.
IF YOU COME TO A MOVE THAT YOU
CAN'T DO, WHATEVER THE REASON,
YOU CAN SKIP THAT MOVE
JUST LIKE YOU'D SKIP A SONG
AND STILL GET
A FULL WORKOUT.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE WORLD
HAVE DISCOVERED HOW EASY IT IS
TO FIT SWORKIT INTO THEIR LIVES.
NO EQUIPMENT, NO HASSLE,
NO MORE EXCUSES.
SO,
WHO'S READY TO SWORKIT?
CAN YOU PUT MUSIC TO THIS?
YES, AND WE HAVE A SPOTIFY
INTEGRATION WITH THIS.
Herjavec:
WHO CREATES THE CONTENT?
SO,
WE CREATE ALL THE CONTENT.
SO,
THESE ARE YOUR MODELS?
YES, SO WE HAVE A BENCH OF
PERSONAL TRAINERS.
GREG IS ACTUALLY A CERTIFIED
PERSONAL TRAINER, AS WELL.
WE MET
AT WHARTON BUSINESS SCHOOL.
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?
SO, WE LAUNCHED SWORKIT
A YEAR AGO.
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN
THE HEALTH AND FITNESS SPACE
FOR FIVE YEARS,
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
AND WHAT DOESN'T.
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
WERE YOU IN?
WE STARTED THE COMPANY
FIVE YEARS AGO.
THIS IS OUR THIRD PRODUCT.
-SO YOU STARTED FIVE YEARS AGO.
-YES.
-WITH A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.
-EXACTLY.
-OKAY, WHAT WAS --
-AND WHAT WAS THAT?
-YEAH.
IT WAS A FITNESS TRACKER
CALLED NEXERCISE.
WE GREW IT TO
2 MILLION DOWNLOADS.
-DID YOU MAKE MONEY?
-OH, YES.
YES, WE DID. SO, DURING
THE ENTIRE LIFE OF COMPANY,
WE'VE MADE
JUST UNDER $2 MILLION TOTAL.
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE LAST 12 MONTHS,
AS A COMPANY WE'VE MADE
$770,000.
SWORKIT
REPRESENTS $460,000.
Cuban:
AND THAT'S ALL PREMIUM UPGRADES,
MOST OF WHICH ARE
GET RID OF THE ADVERTISING.
SO, IT'S 2/3 UPGRADES,
1/3 ADVERTISING.
THE APP'S FREE,
AND THEN THERE'S AN UPGRADE
COMPONENT THAT PEOPLE BUY.
-THAT'S RIGHT.
-YES.
AND WHAT'S THE COST
FOR UPGRADE?
IT'S $3.99
FOR THE PRO VERSION.
YOU DON'T SEE ANY ADS,
AND IT'S MORE CUSTOMIZABLE.
-IS IT AN ANNUAL CHARGE...
-$3.99 UPGRADE.
...THAT'S MAINTAINED ON
A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS?
NO, WE'RE INTRODUCING A
SUBSCRIPTION BASIS IN NOVEMBER,
AND SO THAT WILL BE
$9.99 A MONTH.
WE'RE REAL EXCITED
ABOUT THAT
BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA INTRODUCE
PREMIUM CONTENT,
SO IT'LL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO
ACTUAL EQUIPMENT.
SO KETTLE BELLS,
EXERCISE BALL.
Young: YOU WILL TAKE
THE EXCESS INVENTORY.
BUT IT'S UNSOLD.
AND THEN
YOU'RE GETTING THE PAID BACK,
SO IT DOESN'T COST YOU ANYTHING
UNTIL YOU RECOUP IT.
IT -- IT DOES --
YOU KNOW, IT'S A WIN-WIN
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT LOSING
ANYTHING BY OFFERING IT TO ME
AS VALUE TO MY COMPANIES
IF IT'S UNSOLD.
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE
AN INCENTIVE
FOR ME TO ADVERTISE FOR THEM
AFTER I USE UP MY CREDIT.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
Greiner: I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
LISTENING TO EVERYTHING,
JUST TAKING IT ALL IN.
AND I WAS ON THE FENCE.
I WAS THINKING $1.5 MILLION,
KIND OF HIGH,
GONNA TAKE A WHILE.
IS IT LUNCH YET?
IS IT LUNCH YET?
-I ALSO THOUGHT TO MYSELF --
-LOOK, YOU -- YOU --
ALSO THOUGHT TO MYSELF --
WAIT, MARK, RUDE.
MAKE THE CHOICE.
MARK, LET HER TALK.
-WHY?
-I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF TALKING.
I'VE GOT $1.5 MILLION
ON THE TABLE.
'CAUSE IT'S RESPECTFUL.
-RIGHT.
-IT'S RESPECTFUL, LET HER TALK.
SO, I'M THINKING,
I'LL GO BACK.
THE RISK IS YOURS.
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN.
BEN AND GREG HAVE TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR WORKOUT APP, SWORKIT.
BUT MARK IS GETTING
INCREASINGLY IMPATIENT.
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
LISTENING TO EVERYTHING,
JUST TAKING IT ALL IN.
AND I WAS ON THE FENCE.
IS IT LUNCH YET?
IS IT LUNCH YET?
-I ALSO THOUGHT TO MYSELF --
-YOU -- YOU -- LOOK --
I ALSO THOUGHT TO MYSELF --
WAIT, MARK, RUDE.
MAKE A CHOICE.
-MARK, LET HER TALK.
-WHY?
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF TALKING.
I'VE GOT $1.5 MILLION
ON THE TABLE.
'CAUSE IT'S RESPECTFUL.
IT'S RESPECTFUL,
LET HER TALK.
SO, I'M THINKING,
I'LL GO BACK.
THE RISK IS YOURS.
SO, I'M THINKING 8% --
MNH.
10%? MNH.
YOU'RE MAKING ME WAIT
FOR THIS?
FOR ME, I CAN'T SEE
YOUR VALUATION RIGHT NOW.
I'M OUT.
WELL, THANK YOU, LORI.
BEN, GREG,
I-I LOVED YOU GUYS.
I LOVE THE IDEA.
MY OFFER WAS GONNA BE
$1.5 MILLION FOR 16%.
I THINK, UH,
MARK'S GOT A CLEVER OFFER.
HE'S BUYING YOUR
UNUSED AD INVENTORY...
-YEAH.
-...AND CONVERTING IT,
SO THERE'S A DOLLAR VALUE
THERE.
I -- I CAN'T SEE IT AT 10%.
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST,
BUT I'M OUT.
I EXERCISE
THREE SOLID HOURS A WEEK
WITH A GREAT LUXURY
OF A PERSONAL TRAINER.
MY ISSUE IS I KNOW I SHOULD BE
DOING IT FIVE DAYS A WEEK,
AND THIS IS AN ISSUE
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO TRULY WANT
TO STAY IN SHAPE.
THIS IS LIKE
THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM.
BUT I'M SITTING HERE
AND THINKING,
"SHOULD I INVEST $1.5 MILLION
IN THIS BUSINESS
AND MAYBE MAKE A KILLING?
OR SHOULD I INVEST $3.99
AND GET IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE?
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU CAN DO BOTH.
I'M GONNA DOWNLOAD THIS TODAY,
AND I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
WE APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
FAIR ENOUGH, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
BARBARA.
SO, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
-DEAL.
-DEAL.
[ LAUGHS ]
-APPRECIATE IT, GUYS.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
-PLEASURE.
-THANKS SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT.
-APPRECIATE IT, GUYS.
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
-THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
-CONGRATS.
Corcoran: NICELY DONE.
Young:
MARK JUST ADDS STRATEGIC VALUE.
HE'S CONNECTED INTO SPORTS.
WE WANT TO EXPAND THIS
TO PHYSICAL THERAPY, SPORTS.
LIKE, THERE'S A LOT OF
OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO GET
OUT OF THE BIG VISION OF THIS
THAT HE CAN JUST BE PART OF.
Narrator: EARLIER THIS SEASON,
ENTREPRENEUR CHRIS GILPIN
LANDED A DEAL WITH LORI GREINER
AND ROBERT HERJAVEC
FOR HIS CREDIT CARD PROTECTOR
SignalVault.
OUR E-FIELD TECHNOLOGY
MAKES YOUR INFORMATION
INVISIBLE TO HACKERS.
I'LL DO IT.
WILL YOU?
I'M IN.
Narrator: LET'S SEE HOW CHRIS
IS DOING NOW.
WE STARTED WITH
4,800 SignalVaults.
LOOK AT THE SCREEN, CHRIS.
-YAY!
THAT'S SOLD OUT.
Gilpin: LORI BROUGHT ME ON QVC,
AND WE SOLD OUT
IN JUST EIGHT MINUTES.
WHEN I PITCHED TO THE SHARKS,
I HAD A LITTLE OVER $300,000
IN SALES.
JUST FOUR MONTHS LATER,
WE'VE DONE $2 MILLION IN SALES.
WE'VE GROWN TO 12 EMPLOYEES,
AND WE'VE MOVED OUR OPERATIONS
INTO OUR VERY OWN SPACE.
-Hi, Chris.
-HEY, LORI.
IN ADDITION TO
GETTING ME ONTO QVC,
LORI HAS HELPED ME WITH MY NEW
PACKAGING FOR THE SignalVault,
AND SHE'S HELPING ME
GET INTO STORES
LIKE BED BATH &amp; BEYOND
AND STAPLES.
AND ROBERT
BROUGHT THE SignalVault
ON "GOOD MORNING AMERICA"
AND SHOWED EVERYONE
HOW IT WORKS.
PUT THIS NEXT TO
YOUR CREDIT CARS.
IT BLOCKS THE RFID SCREEN.
ROBERT AND HIS TEAM ARE
TOP EXPERTS ON CYBERSECURITY.
THEY'VE HELPED ME WITH
SEARCH-ENGINE OPTIMIZATION,
AND THEY'VE HELPED ME
PREPARE MY WEBSITE
FOR THE INCREASE IN ORDERS.
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS REACH OUT
TO EVEN MORE COMPANIES.
PITCHING ON "SHARK TANK"
WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS
I'VE EVER DONE.
BUT NOW IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.
I'M NOW EXPECTING
MY SECOND CHILD,
AND THE RAPID GROWTH
FROM "SHARK TANK"
HAS GIVEN ME
THE CONFIDENCE TO KNOW
I WILL BE ABLE TO
PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
WHEN I WALK IN TO MY OFFICE
AND I SEE MY EMPLOYEES,
I JUST GET THIS FEELING
THAT I'VE MADE IT.
AND IT'S ALL BEEN POSSIBLE
BECAUSE OF "SHARK TANK."
All: SignalVault!
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A BUSINESS HOPING TO
EXPOSE THE DIRTY SECRET
LURKING IN YOUR BED.
HEY, GUYS. HOW'S IT GOING?
-HEY, BEN.
I LIVE WITH MY MOM
AND MY GRANDMA LOIS,
WHO I CALL "BUBBE."
GO FISH, BUBS.
BUBBE AND I ARE VERY CLOSE,
AND SHE'S FULL OF GREAT ADVICE.
IN FACT, WHEN I FIRST STARTED
MY PRODUCT,
SHE WAS MY FIRST SUPPORTER
AND ACTUALLY INVESTED
IN THE BUSINESS.
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT
THE ENVIRONMENT
BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN
A GENERATION WHERE EVERYONE
STARTED TAKING THE ENVIRONMENTAL
CONCERNS SERIOUSLY.
POOR BOY.
SO MUCH OF THE U.S.
IS COVERED IN OUR TRASH,
AND A SURPRISING AMOUNT
COMES FROM OUR BATHROOMS.
SO I DEVELOPED
AN ECO-FRIENDLY SOLUTION.
I LOVE THAT I'M ABLE TO
GROW MY BUSINESS WITH MY BUBBE.
IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME
TO SEE THIS BUSINESS SUCCEED.
I NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
SO I CAN GROW THIS TO A PRODUCT
THAT IS SITTING IN THE SHELVES
THAT'S GEARED TOWARDS
YOUNG KIDS,
UM, AND I'VE ALSO GOT KISSTIXX
THAT DOES OEM MANUFACTURING.
IN ADDITION, I'M GUESSING
YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
ACCOUNTING TOOLS BEHIND YOU.
I COULD JUST
TAKE ALL THAT OVER.
ALL THAT SAID,
I'D OFFER YOU $100,000 FOR 25%.
WOW.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
JUST LIKE HE DOES,
I GOT LOTS OF LAWYERS.
I MEAN, I'M SITTING HERE
AND I'M SAYING
THIS COULD BE ONE OF
THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN
ON "SHARK TANK"
IF HE GETS A PATENT.
SO I'M NOT LOOKING AT IT
AS A SHAMPOO.
I'M LOOKING AT IT AS A DELIVERY
MECHANISM FOR EXISTING BRANDS.
I'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR FULL PRICE.
20%.
I'M GONNA INTRODUCE YOU TO THE
RIGHT PERSON AT ESTÈE LAUDER,
AND IF YOU COULD SELL THEM
AND THEY BUY IN,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY.
THAT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT A POSSIBILITY.
IT'S AN ALL-OR-NOTHING
PROPOSITION.
WOULD ANY OF YOU CONSIDER,
LIKE, JOINING?
NO.
I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS ALL
FOR YOUR OFFERS.
BUT, MARK, WE GOT A DEAL.
LET'S DO THIS.
WOW.
