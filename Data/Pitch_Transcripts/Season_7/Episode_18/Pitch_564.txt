MY NAME IS MICHAEL INGLE.
I'M FROM DALLAS, TEXAS.
-YEAH!
I'M HERE SEEKING $1.5 MILLION
FOR 15% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY, CLEAN SLEEP.
CLEAN SLEEP WILL CHANGE THE WAY
YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT THE ONE THING
YOU COME INTO
THE CLOSEST CONTACT WITH
MICHAEL,
CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE THIS?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU CAN GET A TAN.
THEN WE ALSO HIT IT
WITH A DRY STEAM.
MICHAEL,
YOU INVENTED THIS?
YES, SIR.
SO, ALMOST EIGHT YEARS AGO,
FELL ASLEEP ON MY MATTRESS.
MY SHEETS WERE STILL
IN THE WASHING MACHINE,
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST,
MICHAEL?
TO MAKE $75,000 OFF
A SINGLE TRUCK,
IT SEEMS REALLY LOW TO ME.
-YEAH, IT SEEMS REALLY LOW.
WHY AREN'T YOU
MAKING MORE MONEY?
THAT'S JUST LAUNCHING,
JUST GOING TO MARKET.
WE'VE DONE OVER SIX FIGURES
WITH THE FIRST TRUCK ALREADY.
Corcoran: HOW DID YOU GET INTO
THIS BUSINESS, MICHAEL?
SO, AT 14,
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME.
I HAD $120 TO MY NAME.
MICHAEL, WHAT DO YOU NEED
MY MILLION AND A HALF FOR?
WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A COUPLE OF THE MACHINES
MICHAEL, WHEN YOU FIRST
STARTED SPEAKING HERE,
I WAS ACTUALLY, "WHOA, I DIDN'T
KNOW MY MATTRESS WAS DIRTY.
I'M GONNA GET ALL MY MATTRESSES
CLEANED."
WE'RE GETTING THIS
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING,
BUT THE MORE YOU TALK,
THE MORE I REALIZE
I'M A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE
MONEY AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF --
-I'M JUST TRYING TO
LOOK, MICHAEL, IF YOU WERE TO
COME IN HERE AND SAID,
"$150,000 SO I CAN SET UP
ONE MORE TRUCK."
I WOULD BE THERE.
YEAH.
SO, I'M THE LAST SHARK, MICHAEL.
AND I ALWAYS --
-GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.
-THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
-I APPRECIATE.
-GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT. LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IN LIFE.
YOU'LL HAVE A CUSTOMER
IN DALLAS.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS, MARK.
Ingle:
I'LL USE THIS TO EMPOWER ME
OF EVERY SINGLE GROCERY STORE
IN THE UNITED STATES.
IT WILL HELP THE ENVIRONMENT,
IT WILL HELP THE WORLD,
TO FORM JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF
PRODUCT FOR A SINGLE USE.
NOHBO BALLS LEAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO WASTE AT ALL.
