HI. I'M SARAH BUXTON.
I'M FROM LOS ANGELES,
CALIFORNIA.
-CAN WE SEE THEM, SARAH?
-YES, YOU CAN.
I'M GUESSING YOU ALL
ARE IN THE SAME YOGA CLASS.
UH, YEAH.
[ CHUCKLES ]
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK GOOD IN THAT,
ROBERT.
ARE YOU SURE
I DON'T HAVE LORI'S?
YOU WANT TO SWITCH?
[ LAUGHS ]
-HERE YOU GO, BARBARA.
-THANK YOU, SARAH.
NOT MY COLOR,
BUT I'LL ACCEPT.
-OH.
-THE PINK FLORAL PANTS.
BARBARA, JUST TAKE IT.
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANOTHER ONE LATER.
-OKAY.
-SO, SARAH, IT COMES AS
A SHORT VERSION OBVIOUSLY HERE.
-YES.
IS IT A REPLACEMENT
FOR A WET SUIT?
OR IS IT --
-NO, SHE'S PROTECTING HER SKIN.
YEAH, IT'S THE OPPOSITE --
WOULD I WEAR THIS
PADDLEBOARDING?
OH, YOU WOULD WEAR THIS
PADDLEBOARDING 100%
BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT THERE
EXPOSED TO THE SUN, SO...
-BUT WHO'S OUR DEMOGRAPHIC?
-DOES IT KEEP ME WARM?
WHAT AGE WOMAN WANTS TO
COMPLETELY COVER UP HER BODY?
IT'S ACTUALLY IN
EVERY AGE DEMOGRAPHIC.
YES, IT'S PERFECT
FOR THE WOMAN OVER 40.
YEAH?
'CAUSE THE MINUTE
I HIT 40,
MY BOTTOM DROPPED OUT OF
THE BOTTOM OF MY BATHING SUIT.
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST
ABOUT IT.
IT COVERS IT UP.
IT'S PERFECT.
IS THAT -- WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
MOST OF THEM
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR DOLLAR SALES
BY AGE?
-SARAH, WHAT --
-LET ME ASK YOU
ABOUT THE PRODUCT
'CAUSE I'M JUST CURIOUS.
-SURE. YES.
-TOUCHING IT, IT'S STRETCHY.
MM-HMM.
DOES THIS HOLD YOU IN,
SUCK YOU IN A BIT?
IT DOES
SUCK YOU IN A BIT.
WHAT DOES THIS
FEEL LIKE ON?
IT ACTUALLY
KEEPS YOU COOL.
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THE FABRIC
THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW THE SUN
TO PENETRATE.
I'VE SEEN THIS ON CHILDREN
ALL THE TIME.
RIGHT. BUT LET ME SHOW YOU
MY CHILDREN'S LINE THAT'S HERE.
THE THING ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S
LINE IS KIDS HATE SUNSCREEN.
THEY HATE WET SUITS.
THEY HATE RASH GUARDS.
WELL, THAT'S WHY
THEY HAVE IT ALREADY.
BUT CHILDREN --
ARE YOU THE FIRST ONE --
DID YOU CREATE THIS
FOR A REASON?
-I DID. YES.
-WHY?
SARAH, DO YOU HAVE IT
IN RETAIL ANYWHERE?
-I HAVE IT IN ONE STORE.
-I KNOW IT'S BEEN A MONTH.
-ONE STORE.
-OKAY, WHERE?
-IN LAGUNA BEACH.
-DOES IT FLY OFF THE SHELVES?
I JUST GOT IT IN THERE,
SO I DON'T KNOW YET.
THERE ARE NO ANSWERS
TO ANY QUESTIONS.
SARAH, IT'S ABOUT YOUR FOCUS,
RIGHT?
YEAH.
BECAUSE YOU CAME IN HERE
WITH A PERSONAL STORY.
YES.
-FITS PERFECTLY, RIGHT?
-YEAH.
BUT THEN YOU STARTED GOING
OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOLY GRAIL.
THERE'S NOT A DERMATOLOGIST
IN THE WORLD
SARAH, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO
A DERMATOLOGIST FIRST?
SARAH, YOU KNOW,
THE SMALLER YOU ARE,
THE SHORTER THE TIME FRAME
YOU'RE IN BUSINESS,
THE NARROWER THE FOCUS.
-SARAH, IT WAS A GREAT START.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'VE DONE SO WELL
FOR THE FIRST MONTH.
-IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
-THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-GOOD LUCK.
OKAY, BYE.
WELL, WE CAN DANCE BACK.
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T
GET A DEAL TODAY FOR TUTUBLUE,
I AM DEFINITELY GOING FORWARD
WITH ALL KINDS OF PASSION.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT I WANT TO
GET THIS OUT ON EVERYBODY
