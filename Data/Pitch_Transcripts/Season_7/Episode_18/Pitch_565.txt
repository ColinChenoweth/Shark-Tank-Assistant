MY NAME IS MICHAEL INGLE.
I'M FROM DALLAS, TEXAS.
-YEAH!
I'M HERE SEEKING $1.5 MILLION
FOR 15% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY, CLEAN SLEEP.
CLEAN SLEEP WILL CHANGE THE WAY
YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT THE ONE THING
YOU COME INTO
THE CLOSEST CONTACT WITH
AND SPEND THE MOST TIME ON
NEVER GETS CLEANED?
TAKE A LOOK.
EVERY MATTRESS IS REALLY
JUST A GIANT SPONGE
COLLECTING HUMAN WASTES.
-EW.
-EW.
-JUST IMAGINE
HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE'S
DEAD SKIN, SWEAT, SALIVA,
BODILY FLUIDS,
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
IS IN THAT VERY MATTRESS
YOU'LL BE SLEEPING ON TONIGHT.
INTRODUCING
THE CLEAN SLEEP MACHINE
AND MATTRESS CLEANING SERVICE.
THE CLEAN SLEEP'S PROPRIETARY
PROCESS IS 99.9% EFFECTIVE
AT ELIMINATING BACTERIA, MOLD,
VIRUSES, DUST MITES,
AND EVEN BED BUGS.
THE CLEAN SLEEP MACHINE
ALLOWS YOU TO INSERT ANYTHING
FROM CUSHIONS TO PILLOWS,
A BABY'S CRIB MATTRESS,
ALL THE WAY UP TO
A CALIFORNIA KING.
THIS REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY
IS ECO-FRIENDLY,
FULLY AUTOMATED,
TAKES JUST 15 MINUTES,
AND LEAVES YOUR MATTRESS
COMPLETELY DRY.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY TO
JUMP IN BED WITH CLEAN SLEEP
FOR THE BEST NIGHT
OF YOUR LIFE?
-WOW.
-HOW DOES THAT WORK?
IS THAT U.V. LIGHTS?
SO, WE USE U.V. LIGHT.
WE USE
A SUPER-HEATED DRY STEAM.
WE USE A VACUUM
10 TIMES MORE POWERFUL
THAN YOUR VACUUM AT HOME.
WE USE INFRARED HEAT
OZONE INDUCTION,
AND WE ALSO HAVE AN OPTIONAL
ANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENT.
WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO TRUCKS
THAT ARE OUT RUNNING.
YOU CALL US UP, WE GO OUT,
WE TAKE YOUR MATTRESS,
WE PUT IT IN THE MACHINE,
AND IN 15 MINUTES, WE'RE DONE.
MICHAEL,
CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE THIS?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU CAN GET A TAN.
THEN WE ALSO HIT IT
WITH A DRY STEAM.
MICHAEL,
YOU INVENTED THIS?
YES, SIR.
SO, ALMOST EIGHT YEARS AGO,
FELL ASLEEP ON MY MATTRESS.
MY SHEETS WERE STILL
IN THE WASHING MACHINE,
AND I WAS GROSSED OUT
BY THE FACT THAT I WAS
LAYING ON MY MATTRESS.
I STARTED DOING SOME RESEARCH
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING OUT THERE
THAT EXISTS
THAT WOULD ALLOW ME
TO CLEAN MY MATTRESS.
AND FOR THE NEXT 7 1/2 YEARS,
I STARTED DEVELOPING
THE TECHNOLOGY,
AND 2 1/2 YEARS AGO,
I STARTED BUILDING THE PROTOTYPE
IN MY GARAGE AT HOME.
-I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.
HOW OFTEN
DO YOU NEED TO DO THIS?
SO, FOR RESIDENTIAL,
WE RECOMMEND
EVERY SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.
FOR HOTELS, HOSPITALS,
SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES,
IT'S MUCH MORE FREQUENT.
DO YOU HAVE HOTELS THAT HAVE
SIGNED ON TO DO THIS?
YES, WE'VE SERVICED
OVER 30 HOTELS.
WHAT ABOUT REACHING OUT TO,
LIKE, MAJOR HOTEL CHAINS
LIKE HILTON AND HYATT?
SO WE'VE GOT SOME MEETINGS
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET,
AND WE ACTUALLY DID A PILOT FOR
THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR
AND SERVICED ONE HOSPITALITY
COMPANY'S MATTRESSES,
AND IN THREE MONTHS,
SAVED THEM ALMOST $100,000.
WELL, I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU DID THAT.
HOW DID YOU
SAVE THEM MONEY?
WHAT WE DID IS WE WENT IN
AND WE SANITIZED THE MATTRESSES,
WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO
HAVE BEEN REPLACED OR REMOVED.
IT ACTUALLY TOOK THE STAINS
OUT FROM THE MATTRESS?
ABSOLUTELY, YES.
IT'S MORE MENTAL, THOUGH,
ISN'T IT?
LIKE YOU SAID, YOU WERE
LAYING ON YOUR MATTRESS,
YOUR SHEETS
WERE IN THE LAUNDRY.
WHY WERE YOU
SO GROSSED OUT?
THERE'S A REASON WHY
YOU WEIGH LESS IN THE MORNING
THEN WHEN YOU DO WHEN YOU
GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.
YOUR BODY'S SWEATING, SECRETING
ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS,
SHEDDING DEAD SKIN CELLS.
-WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE SHEETS
ARE FOR, NO?
WELL, IMAGINE
CHANGING YOUR CLOTHES EVERY DAY
AND NEVER TAKING A SHOWER.
IN JUST A MATTER OF A WEEK,
YOU'D BE FILTHY.
SO, CHANGING THE SHEETS ON YOUR
MATTRESS IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE.
YOU CHANGE THE SHEETS,
YOU CHANGE THE SHEETS,
BUT YOU NEVER
CLEAN YOUR MATTRESS.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST,
MICHAEL?
SO, OUR STANDARD SERVICE
IS $89.95.
-THAT'S ALL?
-YES.
I THINK
YOU'RE CHARGING TOO LITTLE.
YOU GOT TO GO GET IT
OUT OF THE HOUSE, RIGHT?
RIGHT, SO, TYPICALLY,
WHEN WE GO OUT AND WE SERVICE,
WE ALSO UPCHARGE FOR SPOT
TREATMENTS, STAIN TREATMENTS,
ADDITIONAL
HEAT TREATMENTS.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES LAST YEAR
OR THIS YEAR?
SO, SINCE WE LAUNCHED,
WE JUST PASSED PROOF OF CONCEPT,
I ACTUALLY SOLD
THE FIRST FRANCHISE FOR $435,000
AND USED THAT
TO CASH FLOW OPERATIONS.
BUT WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
FROM YOUR TRUCK?
OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS, WE'VE
DONE OVER $100,000 IN SALES
JUST WITH THE FIRST TRUCK.
I'D LIKE YOU TO PITCH ME
AS A FRANCHISEE,
A POTENTIAL FRANCHISEE.
GIVE ME THE NUMBERS.
SO, OUR PROJECTIONS SHOW
ABOUT A $75,000 A YEAR REVENUE
FOR YOUR FIRST YEAR.
ONLY $75,000?
ONLY $75,000.
SO,
WHAT'S YOUR NET ON $75,000?
RIGHT ABOUT BREAK EVEN.
IT SEEMS LOW.
TO MAKE $75,000 OFF
A SINGLE TRUCK,
IT SEEMS REALLY LOW TO ME.
-YEAH, IT SEEMS REALLY LOW.
WHY AREN'T YOU
MAKING MORE MONEY?
THAT'S JUST LAUNCHING,
JUST GOING TO MARKET.
WE'VE DONE OVER SIX FIGURES
WITH THE FIRST TRUCK ALREADY.
AND FRANCHISING
AND THE MOBILE UNIT
IS ONLY PART
OF THIS BUSINESS.
WE'RE IN TALKS WITH HOSPITALS
NOW AND HIGH-VOLUME HOTELS,
AND WE WILL LEASE
THAT MACHINE TO THEM
AND GENERATE RECURRING REVENUE
AND ROYALTIES.
BING! DID I HEAR ROYALTIES?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEN WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
OPERATING COSTS,
INSURANCE, THE TRUCK, LOGISTICS.
-RIGHT.
IF YOU WERE TO SELL YOUR MACHINE
TO A HOTEL CHAIN,
AND THAT HOTEL CHAIN SAYS,
"WE CLEAN OUR MATTRESSES
BY THIS SYSTEM."
SO PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN
IS OFFERING CLEAN SLEEP
CERTIFIED BEDS.
SO YOU CAN GO INTO ANY
HOTEL ROOM IN THAT HOTEL,
LIFT THE SHEETS,
AND KNOW WHEN THAT MATTRESS
HAS BEEN SANITIZED.
Corcoran: HOW DID YOU GET INTO
THIS BUSINESS, MICHAEL?
SO, AT 14,
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME.
I HAD $120 TO MY NAME.
AND TRIED TO GET TO
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS,
AND I REALIZED THAT
I NEEDED MONEY TO EAT,
AND I NEEDED TO HEAD SOUTH.
SO $80 GOT ME TO DALLAS, TEXAS.
I GRABBED A PHONEBOOK.
I TRIED CALLING MY AUNT.
I SAID, "HEY, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW ME OR REMEMBER ME,
BUT I NEED A PLACE TO STAY.
I'M TRYING TO GET TO
SAN ANTONIO."
SO SHE CAME AND PICKED ME WITH
MY BLACK TRASH BAG OF CLOTHES,
TOOK ME TO
MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE,
AND THAT'S WHERE
I CHANGED MY LIFE.
I REALIZED WHEN I WAS DRIVING,
STARING OUT THE WINDOW
THAT THERE'S TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD.
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT
WATCH THINGS HAPPEN
AND PEOPLE THAT
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.
AND I REALIZED THAT
I WANTED TO BE SOMEBODY
THAT WAS GONNA
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.
AND SO FROM THEN ON,
I CHANGED MY LIFE.
AT 16 YEARS OLD,
I GOT HIRED ON BY BOEING
AND WENT THROUGH SIX DIFFERENT
FIELDS OF ENGINEERING WITH THEM
AND DID THAT FOR 5 1/2 YEARS
AND REALIZED THAT WORKING
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WASN'T FOR ME.
YOU'RE
A MECHANICAL ENGINEER?
UM, THAT'S MY BACKGROUND.
I DID NOT...SECURE A DEGREE.
I ACTUALLY SWITCHED
TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
YOU JUST DID THIS STUFF -- YOU
DID THIS ALL ON OUR OWN, RIGHT?
YES. I'VE GOT A MASTERS DEGREE
IN GOOGLE
WITH A MINOR IN YAHOO
AND BING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO...
-WHAT'S YOUR BIG PLAN?
YOU'RE ASKING FOR
A LOT OF MONEY.
HOW ARE WE GONNA
MAKE MONEY BACK?
HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE WE GONNA MAKE?
AND HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET US THERE?
SO, THE WAY YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
MONEY
IS WE'RE GONNA START
LEASING THESE MACHINES
INTO HOSPITALS, INTO MILITARY
AND AIR FORCE BASES,
INTO HIGH-VOLUME HOTELS.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE THAT
ALREADY?
WE JUST PASSED
PROOF OF CONCEPT,
AND I'M IN NEGOTIATIONS
RIGHT NOW.
MICHAEL, WHAT DO YOU NEED
MY MILLION AND A HALF FOR?
WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A COUPLE OF THE MACHINES
SO THAT WE CAN GO OUT
AND DO A PILOT IN A HOSPITAL.
AND --
-WHY?
WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO A PILOT
IN A HOSPITAL?
SO THAT WE CAN SHOW THEM
THAT WE CAN REDUCE
INFECTIOUS DISEASES,
CROSS CONTAMINATION.
I -- I GET WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH,
BUT AREN'T YOU A LITTLE BIT
TOO EARLY?
EARLY IN WHAT SENSE?
IN THE SENSE THAT
YOU'VE GOT PROOF OF CONCEPT,
BUT YOU'RE STILL
AT THAT INTEREST PHASE
AS OPPOSED TO THAT
CLOSE THE DEAL PHASE.
SO, THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO
BRING ON, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE WITH STRATEGIC
PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS.
THERE'S TWO TYPES OF
PROOF OF CONCEPT.
ONE IS,
DOES THE TECHNOLOGY WORK?
YOU'VE DONE THAT.
THE SECOND
PROOF OF CONCEPT IS,
IS THE MARKET
GONNA ACCEPT IT?
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE DONE THAT.
-SURE, SO --
-YOU HAVEN'T EVEN PROVEN
THAT THE MOBILE MODEL WORKS
BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY.
MICHAEL, WHEN YOU FIRST
STARTED SPEAKING HERE,
I WAS ACTUALLY, "WHOA, I DIDN'T
KNOW MY MATTRESS WAS DIRTY.
I'M GONNA GET ALL MY MATTRESSES
CLEANED."
WE'RE GETTING THIS
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING,
BUT THE MORE YOU TALK,
THE MORE I REALIZE
I'M A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE
MONEY AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF --
-I'M JUST TRYING TO
COVER ALL MY BASES
AND EXPLAIN TO YOU GUYS.
YES, BUT FOR ME,
IT'S FAR TOO CONFUSING
AND A LOT OF MONEY,
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY,
THANK YOU, BARBARA.
YOU SEEMED LIKE A VERY FOCUSED
GUY WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN.
I KNOW YOU THINK YOU WERE
GIVING ME MORE OPPORTUNITIES.
-RIGHT.
-BUT THE LONGER YOU TALKED,
I SAW LESS OPPORTUNITIES.
-SO, LET ME --
I HEARD TRUCKS,
I HEARD HOTELS,
I HEARD HOSPITALS.
-RIGHT.
V.A. HOSPITALS,
PRIVATE HOSPITALS.
-SURE.
-IT'S TOO MUCH.
IT'S NOT FOR ME. I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
ROBERT.
LOOK, MICHAEL, IF YOU WERE TO
COME IN HERE AND SAID,
"$150,000 SO I CAN SET UP
ONE MORE TRUCK."
I WOULD BE THERE.
YEAH.
"SO WE COULD EXPAND,
AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
THE UPSIDE BEYOND THAT."
-RIGHT.
-SO YOU HAVE LICENSING HERE.
YOU HAVE YOUR
DOOR-TO-DOOR BUSINESS.
AND THEN YOU HAVE
YOUR FRANCHISING BUSINESS.
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH
OF A MISHMASH
BETWEEN YOUR THREE
AREAS OF REVENUE.
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
I THINK IT'S A REALLY SMART IDEA
FOR HOTEL CHAINS,
BUT THAT'S GONNA BE
A SLOW, LONG PROCESS.
AND ME, I LIKE TO SEE MY MONEY
COME BACK AT LIGHTNING SPEED.
AND MY CONCERN IS THE HOSPITALS
AND THE HOTEL CHAINS.
IT'S GONNA TAKE YOU
A REALLY LONG TIME.
WHILE I THINK IT'S GENIUS,
I HAVE TO BE OUT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
SO, I'M THE LAST SHARK, MICHAEL.
AND I ALWAYS --
ROYALTIES AND RESIDUAL INCOME,
MR. WONDERFUL.
[ LAUGHS ]
NO, I GET IT, BUT YOU KNOW,
I HAVE TO PAY $1.5 MILLION
TO FIND OUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK YOU HAVE
SOMETHING AMAZING HERE,
BUT I'M NOT THERE.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
-GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.
-THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
-I APPRECIATE.
-GOOD LUCK, MICHAEL.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT. LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IN LIFE.
YOU'LL HAVE A CUSTOMER
IN DALLAS.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS, MARK.
O'Leary: MILLION AND A HALF IS
TOO BIG. THAT WAS TOO CRAZY.
YEAH, HE DIDN'T -- HE DIDN'T
SET UP THE DEAL RIGHT.
-TOO MUCH TOO EARLY.
-THAT'S A BAD DEAL.
"SHARK TANK"
COULD BE A GAME.
-GREAT GUY, THOUGH.
-YEP.
Ingle:
I'LL USE THIS TO EMPOWER ME
AND TO HELP ME STAY DRIVEN
AND FOCUSED
AND MOVE FORWARD
AND PUSH THROUGH IT.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A PRODUCT THAT IS FASHIONABLE
AND FUNCTIONAL.
OF EVERY SINGLE GROCERY STORE
IN THE UNITED STATES.
IT WILL HELP THE ENVIRONMENT,
IT WILL HELP THE WORLD,
AND THAT'S WHERE
I SEE THIS COMPANY GOING.
TO FORM JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF
PRODUCT FOR A SINGLE USE.
NOHBO BALLS LEAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO WASTE AT ALL.
AND BY ELIMINATING
THE OUTSIDE CONTAINER,
NOHBO IS CHEAPER THAN
BOTTLED COMPETITION.
MY BUBBE, LOIS,
AND I WILL SHOW YOU
HOW EASY AND CONVENIENT IT IS
TO USE NOHBO.
BUBBE.
STEP 1 -- RINSE THE HAIR.
-WET THE HAIR.
-WET THE HAIR.
WELL, YOU'RE SO BRAVE.
Cuban:
BUBBE'S THE BRAVE ONE.
OKAY, UNWRAP THE SHAMPOO BALL
FROM ITS WRAPPER.
DON'T WORRY,
THE WRAPPER'S COMPOSTABLE.
STEP 2 -- PLACE THE NOHBO BALL
ON YOU HANDS UNDER SHOWER WATER
AND RUB IT TOGETHER
TO WATCH THE MAGIC HAPPEN.
WATCH THE MAGIC HAPPEN,
BABY.
TURNS INTO
A REALLY LATHERY SHAMPOO.
STEP 3 -- WASH LIKE YOU WOULD
WITH REGULAR SHAMPOO.
SCRUB AND RINSE.
DON'T FORGET THE RINSE.
CALM DOWN, BUBBE.
[ CHUCKLES ]
OKAY, I THINK
WE GOT IT GOOD ENOUGH.
ALL RIGHT, WE GET IT.
BUBBE, IT'S A JOKE.
YOUR HAIR'S NOW GREEN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SHARKS,
I NEED YOUR INVESTMENT
SO WE CAN LICENSE THIS
CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY
TO PERSONAL-CARE PRODUCT
COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
