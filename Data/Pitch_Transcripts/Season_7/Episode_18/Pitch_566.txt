Herjavec:
BUT, BENJAMIN, WHY ISN'T THAT
CONVERTING TO HIGHER SALES?
WHY AREN'T
MORE OF THEM UPGRADING?
BECAUSE THE FREE EXPERIENCE IS
ENOUGH FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON.
MY NAME IS BENJAMIN STERN.
MY NAME IS BENJAMIN STERN,
GOOD JOB, BENJAMIN.
-NICE JOB.
-WAY TO KILL IT.
WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN?
I'M AN 11th GRADER.
I'M 16.
MY BUBBE'S 80.
GOOD JOB, BUBBE.
-LOOKS LIKE CHOCOLATE BALLS.
-OH, IT'S INTERESTING.
SO, IT TURNS INTO
A POWDER ESSENTIALLY.
IT TURNS INTO A POWDER
WHICH BREAKS DOWN
TO A REGULAR SHAMPOO PRODUCT.
SO, BENJAMIN, ONE DAY
YOU'RE WASHING BUBBE'S HAIR...
YEAH, BENJAMIN!
-THANK YOU.
-EVERYBODY SAYS
YOU GOT TO KNOW SOMEBODY.
YEAH, BENJAMIN.
-YEAH, I CAN'T TELL YOU
TO PAY A CHEMIST.
-BENJAMIN, THIS IS AN IDEA --
ONE SECOND. BEFORE YOU MOVE ON,
CAN I SEE ONE OF THE BOXES?
YEAH, SURE.
WHY IS IT CALLED NOHBOO?
-NOHBO.
-NOHBO?
"NOHBO" IS ACTUALLY
"NO HAIR BOTTLES" SHORTENED.
O'Leary: IS THERE A CHALLENGE
HERE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT
THE MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
SHAMPOO MARKET?
UH, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THIS PRODUCT.
WE'RE NOT MAKING ONLY SHAMPOO,
BUT WE'RE CREATING
A DELIVERY SYSTEM.
WE CAN LICENSE THIS TECHNOLOGY
TO MAJOR SHAMPOO COMPANIES.
WE CAN LICENSE IT TO L'OREAL,
WE CAN LICENSE IT TO PANTENE.
SO TELL US ABOUT THE ECONOMICS,
BENJAMIN.
I'VE ONLY GOTTEN
PRICING MODELS
FOR A VERY SMALL QUANTITY
OF ORDERS, WHICH IS 100,000.
THAT'S 6 CENTS TO PRODUCE.
THAT'S THE MATERIAL COST.
MY CHEMIST ACTUALLY HAS
WORKED WITH A MACHINE
-OKAY, BENJAMIN.
-YOU ARE BRILLIANT.
-THANK YOU.
-YOU CAME IN,
REALLY AMAZED ALL OF US.
THROUGH MY WHOLE CAREER,
ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS LEARNED --
NEVER SELL SOMETHING
IF YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY READY
BECAUSE
YOU GET ONE SHOT.
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
YOU PROBABLY ARE GONNA BE
FINESSING IT,
PERFECTING IT.
RIGHT NOW, IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR ME TO BE INVOLVED.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I LOOK AT
THE PERSONAL-CARE MARKET.
BENJAMIN HAS ONE OFFER
ON THE TABLE FOR NOHBO,
HIS ECO-FRIENDLY SHAMPOO BALLS.
BUT MARK ALSO SEEMS INTERESTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK, I LOVE IT.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
YOU REMIND ME OF ME, YOU KNOW?
I HAD A GUY, ZACH PILOSOFT,
WHO WHEN I WAS 16,
HELPED ME
FUND MY OWN BUSINESS
-CONGRATULATIONS, BENJAMIN.
-THANK YOU.
-I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU, MAN.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU REMIND ME OF A MINI-ME.
BUBBE!
-I KNEW -- I KNEW IT.
-MAZEL TOV.
I KNEW YOU WOULD DO IT
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
YOU'D BE IMPRESSED WITH HIM.
Stern: IT'S LIKE
HE'LL BECOME MY MENTOR.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.
IT'S REALLY --
IT'S BEYOND WORDS.
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
WINNING THE LOTTERY BUT BETTER.
YOU EARNED IT!
