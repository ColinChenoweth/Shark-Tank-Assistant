HI. I'M SARAH BUXTON.
I'M FROM LOS ANGELES,
CALIFORNIA.
AND MY COMPANY IS TUTUBLUE.
I'M SEEKING $200,000
FOR A 25% STAKE IN MY COMPANY.
I'M HERE TO CHANGE THE LOOK
OF SWIMWEAR.
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE --
SPENT THE DAY AT THE BEACH,
BOOGIE BOARDING, SURFING,
STAND-UP PADDLEBOARDING,
SNORKELING,
BOATING, HANGING OUT.
WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO,
YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL
TO REAPPLY YOUR SUNSCREEN
THROUGHOUT THE DAY
ONLY TO GET HOME TO FIND OUT
EXACTLY WHERE YOU MISSED A SPOT
WITH A RED, PAINFUL SUNBURN.
WELL, TUTUBLUE IS THE ANSWER
TO YOUR PROBLEMS.
TUTUBLUE MAKES
A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND,
ONE-PIECE BEACH SUIT.
IT'S MADE WITH UPF-50 FABRIC.
NOW, UPF-50 FABRIC BLOCKS OUT
97% OF THE SUN'S HARMFUL RAYS.
IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT, DURABLE,
COMFORTABLE, DRIES QUICKLY,
AND IT ACTUALLY KEEPS YOU COOL.
SO, IF YOU'RE SOMEONE
WHO CARES ABOUT
THE DAMAGING EFFECTS OF THE SUN,
THEN TUTUBLUE IS FOR YOU.
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, SHARKS?
DO YOU WANT TO SWIM THESE WATERS
WITH ME?
[ CHUCKLES ]
-CAN WE SEE THEM, SARAH?
-YES, YOU CAN.
I'M GUESSING YOU ALL
ARE IN THE SAME YOGA CLASS.
UH, YEAH.
[ CHUCKLES ]
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK GOOD IN THAT,
ROBERT.
ARE YOU SURE
I DON'T HAVE LORI'S?
YOU WANT TO SWITCH?
[ LAUGHS ]
-HERE YOU GO, BARBARA.
-THANK YOU, SARAH.
NOT MY COLOR,
BUT I'LL ACCEPT.
-OH.
-THE PINK FLORAL PANTS.
BARBARA, JUST TAKE IT.
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANOTHER ONE LATER.
-OKAY.
-SO, SARAH, IT COMES AS
A SHORT VERSION OBVIOUSLY HERE.
-YES.
IS IT A REPLACEMENT
FOR A WET SUIT?
OR IS IT --
-NO, SHE'S PROTECTING HER SKIN.
YEAH, IT'S THE OPPOSITE --
WOULD I WEAR THIS
PADDLEBOARDING?
OH, YOU WOULD WEAR THIS
PADDLEBOARDING 100%
BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT THERE
EXPOSED TO THE SUN, SO...
-BUT WHO'S OUR DEMOGRAPHIC?
-DOES IT KEEP ME WARM?
WHAT AGE WOMAN WANTS TO
COMPLETELY COVER UP HER BODY?
IT'S ACTUALLY IN
EVERY AGE DEMOGRAPHIC.
YES, IT'S PERFECT
FOR THE WOMAN OVER 40.
YEAH?
'CAUSE THE MINUTE
I HIT 40,
MY BOTTOM DROPPED OUT OF
THE BOTTOM OF MY BATHING SUIT.
BUT I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST
ABOUT IT.
IT COVERS IT UP.
IT'S PERFECT.
IS THAT -- WHERE ARE YOU SELLING
MOST OF THEM
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR DOLLAR SALES
BY AGE?
OKAY, I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR, UH, A MONTH AND A HALF.
-NO.
-OKAY.
-SO, YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.
-I DON'T HAVE
THE ANSWER TO THAT,
BUT I COULD TELL YOU, I HAVE
$4,000 WORTH OF SALES, BUT --
NO AGAIN.
IT'S LITERALLY JUST LIKE
JUST STARTED MY BUSINESS.
-SARAH, WHAT --
-LET ME ASK YOU
ABOUT THE PRODUCT
'CAUSE I'M JUST CURIOUS.
-SURE. YES.
-TOUCHING IT, IT'S STRETCHY.
MM-HMM.
DOES THIS HOLD YOU IN,
SUCK YOU IN A BIT?
IT DOES
SUCK YOU IN A BIT.
WHAT DOES THIS
FEEL LIKE ON?
IT ACTUALLY
KEEPS YOU COOL.
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THE FABRIC
THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW THE SUN
TO PENETRATE.
I'VE SEEN THIS ON CHILDREN
ALL THE TIME.
RIGHT. BUT LET ME SHOW YOU
MY CHILDREN'S LINE THAT'S HERE.
THE THING ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S
LINE IS KIDS HATE SUNSCREEN.
THEY HATE WET SUITS.
THEY HATE RASH GUARDS.
WELL, THAT'S WHY
THEY HAVE IT ALREADY.
BUT CHILDREN --
ARE YOU THE FIRST ONE --
DID YOU CREATE THIS
FOR A REASON?
-I DID. YES.
-WHY?
UM, A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,
I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MELANOMA.
AND, UM,
IT WAS REALLY DEVASTATING.
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE MAGNITUDE
OF WHAT MELANOMA MEANS.
EVERY HOUR EVERY DAY,
A PERSON DIES FROM MELANOMA.
BUT, UM...
LUCKILY -- LUCKILY, YOU CAUGHT
IT EARLY, RIGHT?
I'M LUCKILY --
I'M A VERY LUCKY PERSON.
AND WHILE I WAS RECOVERING,
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
AT THE OCEAN WITH MY FAMILY,
AND, UM,
I JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE,
LIKE, NOT HAVING THAT
AS PART OF MY LIFE.
AND SO, I JUST DEVELOPED THIS
IDEA FOR A SUIT.
I THINK
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA.
YOU'VE TAKEN SOMETHING
THAT WORKS FOR KIDS
AND APPLIED IT TO ADULTS.
YOUR MOTIVATION WAS FOR
PROTECTION. I GET THAT.
BUT I'M THINKING
COULD IT BE --
AND DON'T TAKE ME WRONG
WHEN I SAY THIS --
COULD THIS BE A COUGAR-TU?
COULD IT BE --
-A COUGAR-TU. OHHH.
-OH, MY GOD.
-LIKE, COULD IT BE SOMETHING
THAT -- THAT IS POPULAR --
POPULAR FOR WOMEN THAT DON'T
WANT TO WEAR BIKINIS?
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD
WHAT HE SAID TO ME YESTERDAY.
-IS THAT AN ANSWER?
-WHAT DO YOU CHARGE AT RETAIL?
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
-THEY'RE $47 FOR ME TO MAKE.
-OH, SO THEY'RE NOT CHEAP.
RETAIL IS $220.
WOW.
SARAH, DO YOU HAVE IT
IN RETAIL ANYWHERE?
-I HAVE IT IN ONE STORE.
-I KNOW IT'S BEEN A MONTH.
-ONE STORE.
-OKAY, WHERE?
-IN LAGUNA BEACH.
-DOES IT FLY OFF THE SHELVES?
I JUST GOT IT IN THERE,
SO I DON'T KNOW YET.
THERE ARE NO ANSWERS
TO ANY QUESTIONS.
IT'S BRAND-NEW, I'M BRAND-NEW,
I'M A BABY.
BUT ISN'T THAT EXCITING?
DON'T YOU WANT TO
HELP SOMEBODY LAUNCH THIS?
EXCEPT YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $200,000 FOR 25%?
I KNOW MY VALUATIONS
DON'T WORK OUT
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
TO VALUE IT.
YOU DON'T SAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I ONLY GET 25%.
THAT MEANS THE VALUE
YOU'VE PUT ON THIS IS $800,000.
-I KNOW.
-ICHIWAWA, AY, CARAMABA.
-ICHIWAWA!
-YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.
I HAPPEN TO THINK
THE WAY YOU CUT YOUR STYLE
IS FLATTERING
TO ANY FIGURE.
I WOULD DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS
IN THAT PARTICULAR CUT.
-[ LAUGHS ]
-YEAH.
BUT FOR ME, IT'S LIKE
BUYING A LOTTERY TICKET.
IT'S SO EARLY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
THE ONE STORE YOU HAVE IT IN,
IT'S SELLING THROUGH.
AND IT JUST HIT THERE, WHAT?
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO?
-YEAH.
I'M SURE YOU'LL DO WELL
WITH WHATEVER DO.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PERSONALITY,
BUT I'M OUT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER THING THAT
I'M DEVELOPING, WHICH IS --
I DIDN'T HAVE IT TODAY,
BUT I'M DOING A PRINT
THAT'S SHARK REPELLANT?
-SHARK REPELLANT?
-YES. SHARKS ARE ACTUALLY --
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT
RIGHT HERE.
YEAH, EXACTLY, RIGHT?
AM I REPELLING YOU?
I KNEW THAT THERE WAS
GONNA BE A JAB.
-OUCH.
-I SET MYSELF UP.
THE SHARK REPELLENT
WOULD WORK HOW?
WELL, THE THING IS
IS THAT THE ONLY THING
SHARKS ARE AFRAID OF ARE
POISONOUS FISH AND SNAKES.
SO THE BANDED SEA SNAKE
IS SOMETHING THAT IS --
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE GOING --
YOU'RE -- YOU'RE --
SARAH, IT'S ABOUT YOUR FOCUS,
RIGHT?
YEAH.
BECAUSE YOU CAME IN HERE
WITH A PERSONAL STORY.
YES.
-FITS PERFECTLY, RIGHT?
-YEAH.
BUT THEN YOU STARTED GOING
OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOLY GRAIL.
THERE'S NOT A DERMATOLOGIST
IN THE WORLD
WHO WOULDN'T SEE THE VALUE IN
THIS AND RECOMMEND IT, RIGHT?
OF COURSE. YEAH.
BUT THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN
ANY OF YOUR FOCUS.
YOU'RE SELLING IT IN THE STORE
IN LAGUNA BEACH.
OH, THE WHOLE POINT
THAT I MADE IT
IS BECAUSE OF
THE DERMATOLOGY REASON.
RIGHT, I GET THAT, RIGHT?
SO, IT DOES
LIVE IN DERMATOLOGY.
BUT -- BUT WHEN WE
MAKE AN INVESTMENT,
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND --
THE EXACT DIRECTION
THAT IT'S GOING IN.
WELL, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE EXACT
'CAUSE WE CAN BE THERE
TO HELP YOU,
BUT THE MORE DIRECTIONS
YOU GO,
THE MORE WORK IT IS
TO TRY TO GET YOU FOCUSED.
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
BUT I --
I BELIEVE THAT THIS LIVES IN
DERMATOLOGY FOR SURE, 100%.
RIGHT.
EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO
PROTECT THEIR SKIN.
SARAH, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO
A DERMATOLOGIST FIRST?
SARAH, YOU KNOW,
THE SMALLER YOU ARE,
THE SHORTER THE TIME FRAME
YOU'RE IN BUSINESS,
THE NARROWER THE FOCUS.
BUT CAN YOU LIVE IN DERMATOLOGY
AND WATER SPORTS?
YOU CAN, BUT NOT WHEN
YOU'RE ONE MONTH OLD.
OH.
IT'S JUST TOO WIDE FOR ME
RIGHT NOW.
I'M OUT.
LOOK, IT'S NOT EVEN
THE VALUATION THAT'S BAD.
BUT -- BUT IT --
IT'S THE AMOUNT OF WORK
THAT'S BAD.
-BUT I'LL DO ALL THE WORK.
-YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT WORK TO DO YET.
-I PROMISE I'LL DO ALL THE WORK.
I AM SUCH
A HARD-WORKING PERSON.
I'VE BEEN WORKING
SINCE I WAS 14 YEARS OLD.
I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU WORK HARD.
IT'S JUST I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GET ALL EXCITED
ABOUT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO...
NO, NO, NO, I'M REALLY GOOD
AT TAKING DIRECTION.
I REALLY AM.
-[ LAUGHS ]
LIKE, I'VE, UM,
BEEN AN ACTRESS MY WHOLE LIFE.
-YOU LOOK SO FAMILIAR TO ME.
-WELL, BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S,
UH, THE VILLAIN OF TELEVISION.
-OH, REALLY? YOU TOO?
-WELL, YOU SEE, I AM --
I WAS ON "THE BOLD AND
THE BEAUTIFUL" FOR TWO YEARS
AND "DAYS OF OUR LIVES."
-AND YOU WERE ALWAYS
THE VILLAIN?
I ALWAYS GET CAST
AS THE VILLAIN,
SO YOU --
YOU HAVE COMPETITION.
I LOVE IT.
KEVIN'S A VILLAIN IN REAL LIFE,
TOO, THOUGH.
SO, I AM VERY GOOD
AT TAKING DIRECTION.
YOU -- I PROMISE YOU.
I'M SORRY. I'M OUT.
AW, OKAY.
Greiner:
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING.
I'M NOT LOOKING AT
THE MEDICAL ARENA AS MUCH.
I THINK THAT YOUR DESIGNS
ARE VERY EYE-CATCHING.
BUT IT'S VERY EARLY
RIGHT NOW,
SO FOR ME TO INVEST
AT THIS MOMENT,
YOU'RE NOT THERE YET.
I'M OUT.
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S JUST ONE
SHARK, MR. WONDERFUL, LEFT HERE.
I THINK
IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA
AS A SOLUTION
FOR TWO PROBLEMS.
THE -- THE ISSUES AROUND
COUGAR-ISM AND SUN PROTECTION.
KEVIN, MAKE YOUR OFFER.
MY PROBLEM IS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO MAKE AN OFFER.
YOU SIMPLY ASKED FOR TOO --
-WELL, CAN WE LOWER THE PRICE
IF YOU GUYS --
-NO, YOU CAN'T.
-YOU CANNOT DO THAT.
-$200,000 IS TOO MUCH MONEY.
REALLY?
YOU HAVE TO GET
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY.
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HARD.
IT'S A GREAT IDEA,
BUT IT'S NOT A GREAT DEAL.
I'M OUT.
OH, YOU'RE OUT, TOO?
YES, IT'S OVER.
-SARAH, IT WAS A GREAT START.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'VE DONE SO WELL
FOR THE FIRST MONTH.
-IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
-THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-GOOD LUCK.
OKAY, BYE.
WELL, WE CAN DANCE BACK.
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T
GET A DEAL TODAY FOR TUTUBLUE,
I AM DEFINITELY GOING FORWARD
WITH ALL KINDS OF PASSION.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT I WANT TO
GET THIS OUT ON EVERYBODY
AND MAKE THIS THE NEW
BATHING SUIT ALTERNATIVE.
