Herjavec:
BUT, BENJAMIN, WHY ISN'T THAT
CONVERTING TO HIGHER SALES?
WHY AREN'T
MORE OF THEM UPGRADING?
BECAUSE THE FREE EXPERIENCE IS
ENOUGH FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON.
AND WHAT WE DO IS
WE MONETIZE THOSE INDIVIDUALS
THROUGH ADVERTISING, THROUGH
BANNERS AND INTERSTITIALS.
YEAR TO DATE,
JUST TO GIVE YOU
A SENSE OF HOW THIS IS GROWING,
RIGHT?
SO, THE LAST 12 MONTHS,
THE REVENUE FROM SWORKIT
HAS GROWN FROM ABOUT
$44,500 PER MONTH
TO ABOUT $94,000 PER MONTH.
OKAY?
SO, YOUR LAST THREE MONTHS,
YOU'VE DONE AT LEAST $90,000.
-THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
-YEAH, IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
WE ARE THE CATEGORY LEADER IN
INSTRUCTIONAL EXERCISE FITNESS.
WE REGULARLY SIT
IN THE TOP 10
IN THE HEALTH AND FITNESS
CATEGORY...
-YOU DO?
-...IN APPLE APP STORE.
HAVE YOU RAISE ANY MONEY
FROM INVESTORS?
WE HAVE DONE ABOUT $2.1 MILLION
IN FINANCING TO DATE.
AT WHAT VALUATION
ARE YOU DOING THAT?
UH, $11 MILLION CAP.
THE LAST PRICE APPRAISAL
WAS A CAP OF $11 MILLION.
SO WE BASED OUR VALUATION ON
EIGHT ACQUISITIONS
THAT WE'VE SEEN
IN THIS SPACE,
AND WE'RE THE LEADING CATEGORY
LEADER IN INSTRUCTIONAL FITNESS.
WE HAVE OVER
1.5 MILLION ACTIVE --
MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS
RIGHT NOW.
WE STARTED, LIKE,
LOOKING AT THE INDUSTRY.
WE'VE SEEN
BETWEEN 2% TO 9%
IN A SUBSCRIPTIVE MODEL CONVERT,
RIGHT, OF ACTIVE USERS.
AND WE LOOKED AT
MyFitnessPal,
COMPANIES LIKE STRAVA,
ALL OF THESE THINGS.
THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO PAY
IN THAT CATEGORY.
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ADS
ARE BEING SOLD?
UH, 72%.
WE LOOKED AT BUY ADS
ON MyFitnessPal
FOR ALYSSA'S HEALTHY COOKIES,
ONE OF MY COMPANIES.
-YEAH.
-SO, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A VIABLE MARKET.
IT WASN'T LIKE THERE WAS
A TON OF EXCESS INVENTORY.
Greiner:
WHAT DO YOU NEED THE MONEY FOR?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH IT?
SO, WE'RE LOOKING AT DOUBLING
OUR ENGINEERING TEAM --
THREE MORE ENGINEERS.
-WHY?
-UH, SPEED.
-SPEED.
SO, AND WE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION
THE COOL THING,
IS WE ALREADY HAVE ON DECK
TO ROLL OUT SWORKIT KIDS.
WHICH IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE
ON THE LEFT.
SO WE HAVE A KIDS VERSION THAT'S
GETTING READY TO COME OUT.
-OH, THAT'S INTERESTING.
-LOOK, YOU'RE VERY CREDIBLE.
I LOVE SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESSES.
-YES.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE
RAMP RISK IN TERMS OF VALUATION.
-I UNDERSTAND.
-YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND.
OF COURSE.
ARE YOU WILLING,
JUST OUT OF INTEREST,
TO PUT SOME DEBT
ON THIS BALANCE SHEET?
BECAUSE YOU CAN DEFINITELY
CARRY IT
AND NOT GIVE UP
AS MUCH EQUITY.
MAN, WE --
I WILL GIVE YOU
THE $1.5 MILLION IN DEBT,
AND I WANT 2.75% EQUITY
ON CLOSING.
THE DEBT IS OUT THERE AT 7.5%
FOR TWO YEARS,
AND I WILL RETAIN THE 2.75%.
THAT IS A VERY GOOD OFFER
FOR YOU GUYS.
BUT WITHOUT
ANY STRATEGIC VALUE,
AND THAT'S --
-YEAH, THAT'S --
OKAY, GUYS, HE'S ANNOYING
THE HELL OUT OF ME.
OKAY.
-YEAH, YEAH.
-I WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER.
-ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. I LIKE IT.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT PLATFORM.
SO, I'LL OFFER YOU
THE $1.5 MILLION.
I WANT 10%, RIGHT?
SO NOT A BIG SWING.
-YEAH.
PLUS, I WANT $1.5 MILLION WORTH
OF YOUR UNSOLD AD INVENTORY.
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF
ALL YOUR AD INVENTORY IS SOLD,
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR ME,
AND I'M FINE WITH THAT.
BUT IF YOU HAVE
ANY INVENTORY LEFT,
YOU'RE JUST GONNA SELL IT TO ME
AS PART OF MY CREDIT,
AND I GET
$1.5 MILLION WORTH.
FOR HOW LONG
ARE YOU TAKING --
UNTIL IT'S DONE,
UNTIL $1.5 MILLION'S DONE.
I GET THE CREDIT.
-OKAY, SO I UNDERSTAND.
MY NAME IS BENJAMIN STERN.
I'M 16 YEARS OLD, AND I LIVE IN
MELBOURNE, FLORIDA.
AND I'M THE C.E.O. OF NOHBO.
MY NAME IS BENJAMIN STERN,
AND I LIVE IN
MELBOURNE, FLORIDA.
NEXT TO ME IS MY BIGGEST
SUPPORTER AND BUBBE, LOIS.
I'M HERE TODAY SEEKING $100,000
FOR A 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY, NOHBO.
WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY YOU CLEAN
THOSE FLOWING, SHINY LOCKS.
TAKING TO YOU,
MR. WONDERFUL.
YEAH, I NEED THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST,
I WAS SAD TO LEARN THAT
FOUR OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE
ADMIT THEY DON'T
CONSISTENTLY RECYCLE ANY ITEMS
FROM THEIR BATHROOM.
THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO FILLING
ALMOST 1,200 FOOTBALL STADIUMS
EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES
ALONE
JUST FROM EMPTY SHAMPOO BOTTLE
WASTE.
WELL, WITH NOHBO, YOU WON'T NEED
TO THROW OUT
ANOTHER PLASTIC BOTTLE
FOR YOUR SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER,
BODY WASH, OR SHAVING CREAM
NEEDS EVER AGAIN.
THIS PORTABLE LITTLE CONTRAPTION
EXPANDS AND DISSOLVES IN WATER
GOOD JOB, BENJAMIN.
-NICE JOB.
-WAY TO KILL IT.
WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN?
I'M AN 11th GRADER.
I'M 16.
MY BUBBE'S 80.
GOOD JOB, BUBBE.
-LOOKS LIKE CHOCOLATE BALLS.
-OH, IT'S INTERESTING.
SO, IT TURNS INTO
A POWDER ESSENTIALLY.
IT TURNS INTO A POWDER
WHICH BREAKS DOWN
TO A REGULAR SHAMPOO PRODUCT.
SO, BENJAMIN, ONE DAY
YOU'RE WASHING BUBBE'S HAIR...
-YEAH.
-...AND IT HITS YOU --
"I NEED TO COME UP WITH
A BETTER PRODUCT."
AND THE IDEA WAS
"I'M GONNA MAKE A SHAMPOO
WITH ABSOLUTELY
NO BOTTLE."
YEAH, JUST LIKE
THE DISHWASHER DETERGENT TABLET.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING OF
WHEN I THOUGHT OF NOHBO.
HOW LONG AGO DID YOU HAVE
THE BRILLIANT IDEA?
I THOUGHT OF NOHBO
IN JANUARY OF 2014.
IN JULY OF 2014,
I CONTACTED CLOROX COMPANY'S
HEADHUNTER GROUP.
THEY WERE INTERESTED IN
A LICENSING DEAL
ONCE NOHBO'S PATENT
WAS GRANTED.
WE'RE PATENT-PENDING
RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE KI-- SO YOU JUST CALLED
THEM UP OUT OF THE BLUE.
UH, WELL --
THAT'S HOW HE IS.
[ LAUGHS ]
YEAH, BENJAMIN!
-THANK YOU.
-EVERYBODY SAYS
YOU GOT TO KNOW SOMEBODY.
YEAH, BENJAMIN.
-YEAH, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY PEOPLE COME IN HERE
AND SAY,
"I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE A CALL
TO THIS COMPANY."
AND THERE YOU ARE.
YOU JUST CALLED THEM UP.
GOOD FOR YOU.
-YEAH.
WE'VE TALKED TO
MANY MAJOR CORPORATIONS.
AND SO THEY SAID TO YOU
WHAT?
HYATT HOTELS WANTS SAMPLES
OF NOHBO RIGHT NOW.
HOW DID YOU REACH THE RIGHT
PERSON AT THE HOTEL CHAIN?
THAT WOULD BE A MOST
INTIMIDATING CALL
FOR EVEN A GROWN-UP.
WELL,
I FOUND THE C.E.O.'s E-MAIL,
AND THEN, UM, I TOLD THEM
I HAD A BETTER WAY
FOR THEM TO, UM, USE SHAMPOO
OR CONDITIONER BOTTLES.
SO YOU JUST SAID "I HAVE
SOMETHING BETTER, CHEAPER..."
YEAH.
HE SAID HE WANTED SAMPLES.
DID YOU HAVE THE SAMPLES
TO SEND?
NO.
HOW DID YOU HANDLE THE RESPONSE
TO YOUR E-MAIL?
"SORRY, I DON'T HAVE ANY,"
OR...
I SAID, UM, "I AM CURRENTLY
PRODUCING NOHBO BALLS.
I WILL SEND THEM TO YOU
AS SOON AS I AM ABLE TO."
GOOD FOR YOU.
SO HOW DO YOU GO TO
ACTUALLY MAKING IT?
I CONTACTED A CHEMIST THROUGH
A FREELANCING ADVERTISEMENT.
AND, UH, I GOT A JOB AT 14
TO HELP PAY FOR
SOME OF THE INITIAL EXPENSES
OF NOHBO.
UM, THERE'S ONLY SO --
-ONE SECOND. HOLD ON.
-YEAH.
-[ LAUGHS ]
GET THE JOB
TO PAY FOR THE EXPENSES
FOR YOUR COMPANY
YOU WANT TO START.
YEAH. SO WE ARE INDIVIDUALLY
HAND-PRESSING EACH BALL.
THAT'S WHAT --
-IN YOUR HOUSE?
IN BUBBE'S HOUSE?
-NO, NOT IN MY HOUSE.
THE CHEMIST HAND-PRESSES IT.
BECAUSE YOU NEED
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PRESSURE.
EVERY ONE OF THESE, AS YOU CAN
PROBABLY TELL, ARE HANDMADE.
COULD A SHAMPOO COMPANY SAY
"WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A DIFFERENT MEMBRANE
USING OUR OWN SHAMPOO
AS A POWDER"?
I MEAN, IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT A PATENT IS ONLY AS STRONG
AS YOUR ABILITY TO DEFEND IT,
AND I BELIEVE
THIS IS VERY DEFENDABLE,
AND WE CAN BUILD A BRAND --
YOU HAVE IT WRAPPED
IN ALUMINUM FOIL.
TO ME, IT LOOKS LIKE
A CHOCOLATE CANDY.
THAT PACKAGING THAT YOU SEE
RIGHT THERE IS ONLY TEMPORARY.
ULTIMATELY, WE WANT TO USE SOME
SORT OF PLANT PLASTIC PACKAGING
THAT COMPOSTS PRETTY QUICKLY
TO ALIGN WITH
THE ENVIRONMENTAL VISION.
WHERE ARE YOU
ON THE PATENT PROCESS?
SO WE ARE
PATENT-PENDING.
WE HAVE FILED
TWO PROVISIONAL PATENTS.
HOWEVER,
I DON'T HAVE THE CAPITAL
TO CONVERT THOSE PATENTS
INTO NON-PROVISIONAL.
AND IS THAT THE ENTIRE INVENTORY
OF WHAT YOU'VE CREATED SO FAR?
-UH, SADLY, YES.
-[ LAUGHS ]
-OKAY. SO --
-IT'S EXPENSIVE
TO PAY A CHEMIST.
-BENJAMIN, THIS IS AN IDEA --
ONE SECOND. BEFORE YOU MOVE ON,
CAN I SEE ONE OF THE BOXES?
YEAH, SURE.
WHY IS IT CALLED NOHBOO?
-NOHBO.
-NOHBO?
"NOHBO" IS ACTUALLY
"NO HAIR BOTTLES" SHORTENED.
O'Leary: IS THERE A CHALLENGE
HERE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT
THE MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR
SHAMPOO MARKET?
UH, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THIS PRODUCT.
WE'RE NOT MAKING ONLY SHAMPOO,
BUT WE'RE CREATING
A DELIVERY SYSTEM.
WE CAN LICENSE THIS TECHNOLOGY
TO MAJOR SHAMPOO COMPANIES.
WE CAN LICENSE IT TO L'OREAL,
WE CAN LICENSE IT TO PANTENE.
SO TELL US ABOUT THE ECONOMICS,
BENJAMIN.
I'VE ONLY GOTTEN
PRICING MODELS
FOR A VERY SMALL QUANTITY
OF ORDERS, WHICH IS 100,000.
THAT'S 6 CENTS TO PRODUCE.
THAT'S THE MATERIAL COST.
MY CHEMIST ACTUALLY HAS
WORKED WITH A MACHINE
THAT CAN LITERALLY SPIT OUT
THOUSANDS OF THESE NOHBO BALLS.
THAT'LL DRIVE DOWN OUR COSTS.
ULTIMATELY, WE WANT THE COST
TO BE AROUND 4 CENTS TO MAKE.
IF WE CAN GET THIS PRICE
DOWN TO 4 CENTS
AND WE CAN SELL FOR 12 CENTS,
AND THESE SHAMPOO BOTTLES
IN HOTELS --
OKAY, LET'S PUT ASIDE HOTELS,
RIGHT? FOR A MINUTE.
-OKAY.
-OKAY.
I GET WHY
YOU WANT TO DO IT IN HOTELS.
BUT
TO WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER,
THERE'S A TRAINING PERSPECTIVE
IN A HOTEL.
WHAT THE HOTELS DON'T WANT IS
SOMEONE TO LOOK FOR THE SHAMPOO
AND THEN HAVE TO CALL DOWNSTAIRS
AND GET AN EXPLANATION.
-SO --
-LET ME FINISH, RIGHT?
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS
YOU SELL THEM FOR EVERYBODY WHO
IS ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS.
THEY WILL JUST BUY THE PRODUCT
ONLINE, IN WHOLE FOODS --
ARE YOU GONNA LET HIM LICENSE
THIS TO PANTENE OR NOT?
I WOULD LET HIM,
BUT HOTELS ARE HARDER
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
EDUCATE THE CONSUMER.
-OKAY, BENJAMIN.
-YOU ARE BRILLIANT.
-THANK YOU.
-YOU CAME IN,
REALLY AMAZED ALL OF US.
THROUGH MY WHOLE CAREER,
ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS LEARNED --
NEVER SELL SOMETHING
IF YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY READY
BECAUSE
YOU GET ONE SHOT.
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
YOU PROBABLY ARE GONNA BE
FINESSING IT,
PERFECTING IT.
RIGHT NOW, IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR ME TO BE INVOLVED.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
I LOOK AT
THE PERSONAL-CARE MARKET.
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR BRAND
IS EVERYTHING.
I USE
A CERTAIN SHAMPOO BRAND
TO KEEP THESE BEAUTIFUL LOCKS
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY LOOK.
HOW'S THAT
WORKED OUT FOR YOU?
-IT'S LOOKING GREAT.
-IT FELL OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I LOOK SPECTACULAR.
ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR.
THIS IS DELIVERY MECHANISM --
THE PATENT IS EVERYTHING.
I KIND OF AGREE WITH
MR. HERJAVEC OVER THERE.
I THINK
IT'S A LONG JOURNEY.
I'M GONNA STICK WITH MY BRAND,
KEEP MY BEAUTIFUL LOCKS,
BUT I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
IF THE PATENT IS REAL,
YOUR OFFER IS VERY GOOD.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR 20%,
BUT IT'S AN OPTION.
I WANT TO WAIT
TILL THE PATENT'S GRANTED,
AND I WANT TO DO
A LICENSING DEAL.
THE PATH I SEE
IS YOU LICENSE IT
WITH AN OPTION
TO STILL SELL
TO CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE MARKET
ON YOUR OWN.
THESE COMPANIES --
THEY WILL MAKE
MILLIONS OF THEM
AT A COST
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.
YOU USE THAT MONEY
TO FUND IT,
AND IF YOU WANT,
GO BUILD A BRAND.
OKAY.
THAT'S MY OFFER,
BUT IT'S REALLY AN OPTION.
Cuban: YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK, I LOVE IT.
Narrator: TWO SHARKS ARE OUT.
BENJAMIN HAS ONE OFFER
ON THE TABLE FOR NOHBO,
HIS ECO-FRIENDLY SHAMPOO BALLS.
BUT MARK ALSO SEEMS INTERESTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK, I LOVE IT.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
YOU REMIND ME OF ME, YOU KNOW?
I HAD A GUY, ZACH PILOSOFT,
WHO WHEN I WAS 16,
HELPED ME
FUND MY OWN BUSINESS
AND GOT ME STARTED
AND REALLY DID A LOT FOR ME.
HERE IS MY OFFER.
I'VE GOT TOO MANY LAWYERS
THAT WORK FOR ME,
SO HELPING WITH THE PATENT
IS EASY.
I ALSO HAVE HOT TOT,
WHICH IS A SHAMPOO COMPANY
-CONGRATULATIONS, BENJAMIN.
-THANK YOU.
-I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU, MAN.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU REMIND ME OF A MINI-ME.
BUBBE!
-I KNEW -- I KNEW IT.
-MAZEL TOV.
I KNEW YOU WOULD DO IT
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
YOU'D BE IMPRESSED WITH HIM.
YEAH, AND I WAS.
I REALLY AM.
CONGRATULATIONS.
-GOOD JOB.
-BYE.
-YOU'RE AMAZING.
-BYE, BUBBE!
VERY COOL.
YES!
YAY!
[ LAUGHS ]
Stern: IT'S LIKE
HE'LL BECOME MY MENTOR.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.
IT'S REALLY --
IT'S BEYOND WORDS.
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
WINNING THE LOTTERY BUT BETTER.
YOU EARNED IT!
