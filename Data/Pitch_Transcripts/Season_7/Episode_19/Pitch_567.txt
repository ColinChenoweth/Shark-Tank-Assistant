HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M KONEL BANNER.
AND I'M FRANK WESTON,
AND WE'RE FROM RIVERDALE, UTAH,
AND OUR COMPANY
IS INSTA-FIRE.
AND WE'RE SEEKING $300,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
NOW,
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME,
MAN HAS SEARCHED FOR
AN EASIER WAY TO START A FIRE.
CAVEMEN
BANGED ROCKS TOGETHER.
THE NATIVES
RUBBED STICKS TOGETHER.
EVEN DANIEL BOONE
USED FLINT AND STEEL.
SO, WE DIDN'T INVENT FIRE,
WE PERFECTED IT.
NOW, INSTA-FIRE
IS THE SAFEST
AND YET MOST POWERFUL
FIRE STARTER,
CHARCOAL BRIQUETTE
LIGHTER,
AND EMERGENCY FUEL
ON THE PLANET.
WATCH HOW EASY IT IS.
YOU JUST TOUCH IT
WITH A MATCH OR LIGHTER,
AND YOU SEE IT LIGHTS
SIMILAR TO A CANDLE.
NOW, ONCE IT'S LIT,
NOW IT WILL TAKE
A 20-
TO 30-MILE-AN-HOUR WIND,
FLOATS AND BURNS RIGHT ON WATER,
BUT YET, MORE IMPORTANT,
IT WON'T BURN OUT
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR GRILL
WHEN YOU USE IT
TO LIGHT CHARCOAL.
BUT YET IT'S SO SAFE,
IF I DO NEED TO PUT IT OUT,
I CAN PUT IT OUT
EVEN WITH ITSELF.
INSTA-FIRE IS AS EASY
AS ONE, TWO, THREE.
SIMPLY OPEN THE POUCH,
POUR IT OUT, LIGHT IT,
ADD A LOG,
AND YOUR FIRE'S GOING.
NOW, WITH CHARCOAL,
IT'S JUST AS SIMPLE.
MOST PEOPLE USE
A CHARCOAL CHIMNEY.
THEY TAKE NEWSPAPER
AND STUFF UP UNDER THE CHIMNEY.
AND IT'LL
GET THEIR COALS GOING,
BUT WHEN THEY GO
TO DUMP THEIR COALS,
THE ASH BLOWS ALL OVER
THE BACKYARD.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY'VE STARTED THEIR NEXT FIRE.
WE'VE ACTUALLY ELIMINATED THAT
BY DEVELOPING A CELLULOSE POUCH.
SIMPLY JUST LIGHT
BOTH SIDES OF THE POUCH
AND PLACE YOUR COALS RIGHT OVER
THE TOP OF THE POUCH.
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
HOW YOU'RE GONNA BOIL WATER
OR COOK YOUR FOOD
IN AN EMERGENCY?
EVERY DAY.
EVERY DAY.
[ LAUGHS ]
INSTA-FIRE SOLVES THIS
PROBLEM, AS WELL. OKAY?
ONE CUP OF INSTA-FIRE,
USING NOTHING ELSE,
WILL BOIL 4 CUPS OF WATER
IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
NOW, WHETHER YOU'RE HIKING,
CAMPING, BACKPACKING, GRILLING,
RVing, ATVing -- ALL GOOD FIRES
START WITH INSTA-FIRE.
DO YOU HAVE SAMPLES
FOR US TO TOUCH?
WE DO ACTUALLY
HAVE SAMPLES FOR YOU.
HERE'S OUR FIRE STARTER.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
Herjavec: I THOUGHT
WATER DIDN'T PUT OUT.
WATER WILL PUT IT OUT.
IF YOU POUR IT OVER IT.
IT'LL ACTUALLY FLOAT AND BURN
ON -- ON WATER, OKAY?
HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
SO, THIS OLD MAN, I MET HIM AT
A MOUNTAIN MAN RENDEZVOUS.
A MOUNTAIN MAN RENDEZVOUS?
A MOUNTAIN MAN RENDEZVOUS.
PEOPLE GO, COME FROM
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
AND THEY DRESS UP LIKE
A MOUNTAIN MAN.
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?
OH, THROW TOMAHAWKS,
AND, YOU KNOW --
IT'S A REENACTMENT OF --
OF THE MOUNTAIN MAN ERA.
ALL RIGHT. SO YOU GO TO
THE MOUNTAIN MAN --
SO, I'M -- I'M AT
THE MOUNTAIN MAN RENDEZVOUS.
I SEE THIS OLD MAN,
HE'S BURNING A ROCK.
AND I THOUGHT,
"WHAT THE HECK?"
THE OLD MOUNTAIN MAN
HAD THE IDEA?
HE KIND OF
HAD THE IDEA.
I SAID,
"LET ME DEVELOP IT."
IS THE VISION FOR THIS --
IS IT AN EMERGENCY PRODUCT?
IS IT A FIRE STARTER?
WHAT -- WHAT IS -- WHERE ARE
YOU GONNA SELL THE MOST?
ALL -- ALL OF THE ABOVE.
THERE'S THREE DIF--
WE'VE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED
THREE MARKETS.
WHAT ARE THE THREE MARKETS?
WE ACTUALLY STARTED WITH
THE EMERGENCY
PREPAREDNESS MARKET,
DOING AN EMERGENCY FUEL.
WHICH IS THOSE BUCKETS.
WHICH IS THE LARGER BUCKETS,
THE EMERGENCY FUEL.
GOT IT. OKAY.
OKAY.
AND THEN -- AND THEN, UH,
WE -- WE KIND OF MOVED INTO
THE FIRE STARTER
AND THEN MOVED INTO
OUR CHARCOAL BRIQUETTE
LIGHTER.
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS?
ABOUT SEVEN YEARS NOW.
-SEVEN YEARS.
-OH, WOW!
AND WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
UH, TO DATE,
IT'S $2.1 MILLION.
THAT'S ALL?
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED.
WHAT WERE THEY LAST YEAR?
LAST YEAR,
WE WERE $378,000.
OH.
THIS YEAR,
WE PROJECT $850,000.
WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU
SELL THESE FOR,
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
SO 18 1/2 CENTS FOR THAT UNIT
IS WHAT IT COST US.
EVERYTHING, ALL IN?
ALL IN...
EVERYTHING ALL IN.
PACKAGING,
LABOR, EVERYTHING.
18 1/2 CENTS?
18 1/2 CENTS.
AND WITH
A PACKAGING MACHINE,
WE CAN GET IT DOWN
ABOUT ANOTHER NICKEL.
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
SELL IT WHOLESALE AT $74,
AND WE RETAIL AT $149.
ANYBODY CAN MAKE IT.
IT'S NOT PROPRIETARY, RIGHT?
OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
NO,
IT'S -- IT'S PATENTED.
Herjavec: WHAT AM I MISSING?
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.
BEEN DOING IT FOR SEVEN YEARS.
IT WORKS.
THERE MUST BE A COMPETITOR
OR SOMETHING THAT --
NO, SO, WHAT'S HAPPENED IS
WE DIDN'T GET THE WORD OUT FOR,
OBVIOUSLY, FOR SEVEN YEARS,
RIGHT?
FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF,
THAT'S WHEN
WE REALLY GOT INTO RETAIL
AND NOW THE HOME DEPOT, SO --
THE HOME DEPOT, MEIJERS, ACE,
TRUE VALUE, CABELA'S --
MOST OF THOSE HAVE COME ON
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS.
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH
$3 MILLION?
YOU ASKED $300,000 FOR 10%.
YOU'RE SAYING THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH $3 MILLION TODAY.
SO, WE WILL DO
$850,000 THIS YEAR --
WHAT WILL YOU MAKE ON THAT?
$238,000.
AND WHAT DO YOU PAY
YOURSELVES?
JUST $36,000.
$36,000 EACH?
-YEAH.
-YEP.
JUST LIVING ON DIRT
RIGHT NOW.
AND YOU'RE RUNNING -- YOU'RE
RUNNING EVERYTHING, RIGHT?
-LITERALLY.
-[ LAUGHS ]
YEAH, YEAH.
WE WEAR ALL THE HATS.
YOU'RE SELLING
A $1.29 PRODUCT.
I MEAN, IT'S -- IT'S TOUGH.
YOU GOT TO DO MASSIVE VOLUME.
YOU'RE SAYING THE BUSINESS
IS WORTH $3 MILLION.
YOU'RE PRICING IN
EXECUTIONAL EXCELLENCE TODAY.
WHEN YOU'RE IN GROWTH MODE,
IT'S ALL ABOUT
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE WORTH
IN THE FUTURE.
Konel: CORRECT.
BUT $300,000 --
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR 10%.
SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF EQUITY.
YOU'RE VALUING THE COMPANY
AT $3 MILLION TODAY.
EVERYTHING HAS GOT TO WORK
REALLY WELL
FOR ME TO OWN 10%
AND GET A RETURN ON IT.
I'M OUT.
APPRECIATE
YOU LISTENING TO US.
GUYS, I -- I LOOK AT THIS
OPPORTUNITY IN A SPACE
I SORT OF KNOW
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.
UM, YOU GOT A LOT OF WORK
AHEAD OF YOU.
THE ONLY WAY
I'LL DO THIS DEAL IS,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $300,000,
I WANT TO BE
THE THIRD PARTNER -- 33 1/3%
I WANT A SAY
IN WHAT WE'RE DOING IN RETAIL,
'CAUSE I CARE ABOUT THAT.
I COULD HELP YOU A LOT
IN SOCIAL-MEDIA PLATFORM
OF THIS SPACE.
YOU KNOW, I-I'M REALLY
INTERESTED IN THAT
PREPPER MARKET.
I-I HAVE AN OFFER.
MY OFFER IS $300,000
FOR 20% EQUITY
AND 33 1/3% EQUITY ONLINE.
SO, ANY ONLINE SALES
YOU WANT 1/3 OF?

YOU'RE ONLY DOING 5% NOW,
AND I THINK I CAN GROW THAT

I THINK WE GOT TO
PARTNER TOGETHER ON THIS
AND KNOCK THESE GUYS OUT.

YEAH, BUT WE'RE GONNA
MAKE IT A LOT BIGGER.
SO, WE'RE 1/3, 1/3, AND 1/3.
O'Leary: I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF THE BUSINESS IS WORTH
MORE THAN A MILLION BUCKS
RIGHT NOW.
SO I DON'T THINK
1/3 IS CRAZY.
WELL, I HAVE A LOT OF PRODUCTS
IN YOUR SPACE.
OH, PERFECT.
YOU KNOW, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT
ALL THE PLACES THAT YOU'RE IN
AND HOW TO REALLY GENERATE
THOSE SALES
AND REALLY BUILD THAT UP
TO BE A LOT BETTER, BROADER,
AND FASTER.
WE -- WE ALL HAVE THAT,

A LITTLE REVISION.
WE ALL HAVE THAT.
EVERYBODY --
IF YOU GUYS WILL DO 20%,
YOU GOT A DEAL.
20% IS NOT ENOUGH.
THAT'S NOT -- IT'S --
NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I OFFERED YOU 20% EQUITY.
NO?
YEAH, HE DID.
YEAH, I OFFERED YOU
20% EQUITY...
HE OFFERED US 20%.
AND 33% OF THE ONLINE,
WHICH I'LL DO THE ONLINE.

TOUCH YOUR WEBSITE.
...AND GROW THAT.

ALREADY, GUYS.
YEAH. WE ALL --

I LOOK AT IT,
I'M THE KING OF QVC.
SHE'S MY QUEEN.
HE'S THE JOKER OF QVC.
[ LAUGHS ]
HE'S A WANNABE.
HE WANTS TO BE ME.
THE THING IS, WE ALL SELL ON QVC
'CAUSE WE HAVE HUGE BRANDS.
-FRANK, YOU GOT TO --
-THIS IS NOT A QVC PRODUCT.
I'LL GO DOWN TO 17.5% OWNERSHIP,
25% ONLINE.
BUT THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
I'LL BLEND IT DOWN TO 25%, JUST
WANT TO DO THE DEAL MYSELF.
25%.
