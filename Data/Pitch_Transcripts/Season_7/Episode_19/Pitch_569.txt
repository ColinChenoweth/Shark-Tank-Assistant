WE HAVE BEEN KNEE-DEEP
IN FILET MIGNON.
THE NIGHT WE AIRED, WE SOLD
A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS.
AND IN THE 3 MONTHS
SINCE THEN -- $1.4 MILLION.
Fogelson: THAT'S OVER
150,000 BAGS OF JERKY.
Both: AAAAH!
WE'VE BEEN THRILLED
ABOUT OUR SUCCESS,
BUT SUCH INSANE GROWTH
COMES WITH A LOT OF CHALLENGES.
OUR CO-PACKER JUST CAN'T
MEET OUR NEW DEMAND,
AND WE NEED TO EXPAND FAST.
John:
YOU GUYS READY TO DO THIS?
LET'S DO IT.
ABSOLUTELY.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM TO HAVE,
TOO MANY SALES
IS THE ONE YOU WANT.
SO I BROUGHT DANIEL AND JORDAN
TO MEET WITH
RASTELLI FOODS GROUP.
QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY
IS THE ABSOLUTE,
MOST IMPORTANT THING TO US.
I THINK WE CAN HELP.
WE'RE PREPARED TO FILL
THE DEMANDS YOU GUYS HAVE GOT,
BE ABLE TO PROCESS THE PRODUCT,
AND THEN FINALLY,
TO DISTRIBUTE THAT PRODUCT
TO YOUR CUSTOMERS.
WE CAN NOT ONLY
MAINTAIN THE QUALITY,
BUT WE CAN LOWER THE COSTS.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
CAN'T WAIT TO GET GOING.
LET'S TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT STEP.
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THIS
JERKY IN EVERYBODY'S HANDS.
BEING A JERK
HAS NEVER FELT SO GOOD.
CHECK THIS OUT.
Barrocas: DAYMOND SAW
THAT WE WERE STRUGGLING
AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK ACTION.
WITH THIS OFF OF OUR SHOULDERS,
WE CAN FOCUS ON
GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND GETTING
ON MORE AND MORE SHELVES.
THIS WHOLE
"SHARK TANK" EXPERIENCE
HAS BEEN THE BEST
FOR OUR BUSINESS.
THE SKY IS THE LIMIT
FOR THREE JERKS JERKY.
AND WE CANNOT WAIT
TO SEE WHAT'S NEXT.
MY NAME IS DEE COWGER.
THIS IS MY WIFE, ANGIE.
AND WE LIVE IN THE SMALL TOWN OF
WEBSTER SPRINGS, WEST VIRGINIA.
DEE AND I
WENT TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.
WE WERE IN GRADE SCHOOL,
AND ONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS
DARED ME TO KISS HIM,
SO I DID.
AND IT MUST HAVE MADE
AN IMPRESSION.
HERE WE ARE, 28 YEARS LATER,
THREE CHILDREN, ONE GRANDCHILD,
TWO MORE ON THE WAY.
HEY, GUYS.
I GOT YOUR HOT DOG.
24 YEARS AGO,
WE OPENED THE CUSTARD STAND,
A FAMILY-OWNED RESTAURANT
SELLING THE BEST HOT DOGS,
ICE CREAM, SANDWICHES,
AND ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN THINK OF.
-EVERYTHING GOOD?
-OH, EVERYTHING IS GREAT.
THE MAIN REASON THAT PEOPLE
COME BACK TO THE CUSTARD STAND
IS BECAUSE
IT'S A HOMETOWN FEEL.
NOT TO MENTION
THE FOOD'S GREAT.
[ LAUGHS ]
THERE'S ONE ITEM ON OUR MENU
THAT OUR CUSTOMERS LOVE,
AND THEY DON'T JUST WANT
TO BE ABLE
TO GET IT
AT OUR RESTAURANTS.
SO WE DECIDED TO BRING OUR
PRODUCT TO THE RETAIL MARKET.
WE NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE
A NATIONAL BUSINESS.
WE WANT TO PUT OUR HOMETOWN
AND OUR COMMUNITY ON THE MAP.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S DEE COWGER.
THIS IS MY WIFE,
ANGIE.
AND WE'RE THE PROUD OWNERS
OF CUSTARD STAND FOOD PRODUCTS
IN WEBSTER SPRINGS,
WEST VIRGINIA.
TODAY WE'RE HERE SEEKING
$400,000 FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
-OOH!
-WOW.
24 YEARS AGO,
WE OPENED A SMALL DAIRY BAR
IN WEBSTER SPRINGS,
WEST VIRGINIA,
SELLING ICE CREAM, HOT DOGS,
SANDWICHES, AND SIDES.
OUR NUMBER-ONE-SELLING ITEM
FOR 24 STRAIGHT YEARS
IS OUR HOT DOGS
WITH CHILI.
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
THE RICH AND MEATY CHILI
THAT WE TOP THOSE HOT DOGS WITH
IS A RECIPE FROM MY GRANDPA.
IT'S BEEN IN OUR FAMILY,
PASSED DOWN
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
SINCE THE 1920s.
AFTER COUNTLESS
CUSTOMER REQUESTS,
WE BROUGHT
OUR FAMOUS HOT DOG CHILI
TO THE RETAIL MARKET.
CUSTARD STAND
HOT DOG CHILI
IS AN ALL-BEEF HOT DOG CHILI
WITH NO FILLERS.
THERE'S NO SOY,
NO TEXTURED VEGETABLE PROTEIN,
CRACKERS, OATS --
NONE OF THAT KIND OF STUFF.
THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL ADDITIVES,
PRESERVATIVES, GLUTEN,
OR TRANS FAT
IN OUR PRODUCT.
YOU CAN PRONOUNCE EVERY SINGLE
INGREDIENT ON THAT LABEL.
AND DID I SAY THAT BEEF
IS THE NUMBER-ONE INGREDIENT
ON THAT LABEL?
SO, SHARKS, IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO TRY OUR FAMOUS HOT DOG CHILI.
MMM.
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
WHAT? BRING IT ON.
[ LAUGHS ]
OUR HOT DOG CHILI
DOES NOT HAVE BEANS.
OUR CHILI SOUP DOES HAVE BEANS
AND DICED TOMATOES
AND JUST A LITTLE BIT
MORE HEAT.
SO...
BRING ON THE HEAT!
-IT'S PRETTY SWEET.
-VERY GOOD.
IT IS A LITTLE SWEET.
GOT IT.
YEAH, IT'S GOOD.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: AND YOU MUST HAVE
A LOT OF SALES,
'CAUSE YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $400,000 FOR 10%.
$1.6 MILLION.
LAST YEAR.
-WOW.
-WOW.
-WHOA. GOOD FOR YOU.
-THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
SO, DEE, TELL US HOW
YOU'RE SELLING IT.
UH, WE'RE IN WALMART,
WE'RE IN KROGER.
KROGER'S, SAM'S CLUB...
BUT JUST
ON A REGIONAL BASIS.
JUST ON A REGIONAL BASIS.
IS THAT BECAUSE THE TASTE,
THEY FEEL, IS REGIONAL?
HOT DOG CHILI
IS A REGIONAL PRODUCT.
SO, ANGIE, YOU HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT,
YOU HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL CHILI BUSINESS,
WHY DO YOU NEED $400,000?
WHAT'S THE BIG PLAN?
WE WANT TO BE
THAT NATIONAL BRAND.
WE WANT TO BE THAT PRODUCT
THAT IS EVERYWHERE.
ON THE $1.5 MILLION...
OKAY.
...WHAT DID YOU MAKE
AS A PROFIT?
$217,000.
IS THAT AFTER
YOU PAID YOURSELF SOMETHING?
YES.
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE ONE RESTAURANT
THAT BELONGS TO US,
AND THEN WE HAVE
FIVE FRANCHISE LOCATIONS.
IS THAT PART OF THE $1.6 MILLION
COMING IN?
NO.
NO.
WHAT'S YOUR REVENUE
PER FRANCHISE?
THEY'RE DOING
PROBABLY AROUND $20,000.
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING THOSE
AS PART AS THE DEAL?
WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE PUTTING
THOSE AS PART OF THE DEAL.
IN REGARDS TO THIS BUSINESS,
I LIKE IT, I ATE IT --
REALLY GOOD.
BUT MORE CONCERNING TO ME
IS THE 400K.
TO ROLL OUT NATIONWIDE,
YOU NEED R&amp;D TO KEEP
THE INTEGRITY OF THE PRODUCT.
THEN YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR
IN-STORE ROLL-OUTS NATIONWIDE.
AND THEN
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
SOME FORM OF
BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING
TO TELL THEM
YOU'RE AT THE STORE.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF 400K IS GOING TO DO THAT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR THE WORDS.
WE DO HAVE A PLAN
THAT INCLUDES, YOU KNOW,
THE PROFIT FROM THIS YEAR
THAT WE ESTIMATE
TO BE ABOUT $400,000.
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE GENERATING A LOT OF CASH.
IS THERE ANY DEBT
ON THE BUSINESS TODAY?
THERE IS.
YES, THERE IS DEBT.
THERE'S ABOUT $700,000
WORTH OF DEBT ON THE BUSINESS.
[ ALL GROAN ]
-I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO THAT!
-$700,000?
-SO, YOU GOT TO --
-WE GOT A FLY IN THE CHILI.
$320,000 OF THAT DEBT...
OH, MY GOD.
...IS FROM
THE BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORE
THAT CUSTARD STAND
FOOD PRODUCTS OWNS.
AND THE OTHER $400,000?
WE HAVE
A BRAND-NEW FREEZER.
18x36.
WE CAN STACK
THREE PALLETS HIGH,
AND WE DRIVE FORKLIFTS
IN AND OUT OF IT.
THAT'S A LOT OF DEBT
FOR THE SIZE YOU ARE.
NEITHER OF US HAVE A BUSINESS
OR A MARKETING BACKGROUND.
WE'RE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
WE'RE RAISING THE NEXT
GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS.
-YES, YOU ARE.
-ABSOLUTELY.
Greiner: LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
ALL THREE OF OUR CHILDREN --
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT.
YOU'RE DOING OKAY.
I MEAN, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
WHAT YOU'VE DONE, THOUGH --
YOU'RE GRINDING IT OUT
AND DOING A GREAT JOB.
YEAH, WE ARE. WE HAVE.
WE REALLY HAVE.
YOU ARE CRUSHING IT.
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT --
YOU START WITH THE STAND,
YOU'RE GETTING IT
INTO MAJOR FOOD CHAINS,
SO YOU'RE REALLY DOING
A GREAT JOB.
WHILE I THINK IT'S GREAT
IN YOUR REGION,
FOR ME,
I'M NOT PASSIONATE ABOUT IT
BECAUSE I LIKE
A SPICY CHILI.
I'M OUT.
WELL, IF YOU DECIDE
TO RECONSIDER,
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH PASSION
FOR ALL OF US.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ANGIE, I THINK YOU GUYS
ARE KILLING IT.
I MEAN, YOU STARTED A BUSINESS
WITH ONE STAND.
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.
THANKS.
SO I DON'T HAVE
ANY ISSUE WITH THAT.
AND I THINK
YOU GUYS LOVE THE PRODUCT.
RIGHT.
WHICH I WOULD --
WE STILL EAT HOT DOGS
AT HOME REGULARLY.
YEAH,
WE EAT THEM REGULAR.
THAT'S WHAT I LOOK FOR.
YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.
I LOVE ALL THAT.
BUT I THINK
IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING
TO TAKE
A CHILI SAUCE LIKE THIS
AND ROLL IT OUT
ON A NATIONAL BASIS
WHEN THERE'S
A LOT OF REGIONAL TASTE.
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU'RE GONNA GO
FROM REGIONAL TO NATIONAL
IN A FOOD PRODUCT
LIKE THIS.
I'M OUT.
I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY --
WE'VE HAD A JOURNEY HERE
IN THE TANK TODAY,
AND I'M A NUMBERS GUY,
SO LET ME JUST LAY OUT
WHAT I THINK THIS LOOKS LIKE.
YOU'RE ASKING ME
FOR $400,000 FOR 10%.
A BIG PLAYER
THAT WAS IN THIS MARKET
THAT ALREADY SOLD, YOU KNOW,
CHILI SOMEWHERE ELSE
AND WANTED TO CONSOLIDATE
THIS BRAND
WOULD PAY ABOUT
A MILLION DOLLARS FOR IT.
YOU WANT TO VALUE IT
AT $4 MILLION.
THAT'S A VERY BIG
DIFFERENCE.
YOU WANT ME TO SAY
THAT THE BRAND MAKES UP
THE OTHER $3 MILLION
WORTH OF VALUE.
THAT'S A LOT FOR THIS BRAND
THAT'S REGIONAL. IT REALLY IS.
THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
Cuban:
HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
YOU COME IN
ASKING FOR $400,000 FOR 10%.
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE A BUSINESS
VALUED AT $4 MILLION.
THAT MAKES YOU GUYS
MULTI-MILLIONAIRES.
THAT'S WHY I DO THE SHOW --
'CAUSE EVERYBODY IN AMERICA
IS WATCHING THIS SHOW WONDERING,
CAN THEY BE THAT COUPLE?
CAN THEY BE THAT COUPLE
THAT COMES FROM SOME TOWN
NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF
TO START A STAND
AND BUILD A BUSINESS
WHERE YOU'RE MAKING
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR?
THANK YOU.
NOW, FROM
AN INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE,
THERE'S
TOO MANY MOVING PARTS.
WONDERING WHERE
YOUR TIME WAS BEING SPENT
RELATIVE TO MY INVESTMENT
WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE.
FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT,
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU --
YOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT
EVERYBODY WATCHING THIS SHOW
ASPIRES TO BE, SO YOU SHOULD BE
VERY PROUD OF YOURSELF.
THANK YOU.
-GOOD LUCK.
-GOOD LUCK.
-GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
-GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
