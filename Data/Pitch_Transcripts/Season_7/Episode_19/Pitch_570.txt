MY NAME IS
ERIK HOPPERSTAD.
AND I'M BRIAN BRASCH.
WE'RE FROM FARGO,
NORTH DAKOTA,
AND OUR COMPANY IS
PRX PERFORMANCE.
WE ARE SEEKING
$80,000
FOR A 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
"I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEBODY
DIDN'T THINK OF THIS SOONER!"
"THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR."
"GENIUS!"
"WOW!"
SHARKS, THESE ARE JUST
A FEW OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SAY
WHEN THEY FIRST SEE
OUR PRX PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS.
WE HAVE REDESIGNED TRADITIONAL
WEIGHT-TRAINING EQUIPMENT,
SO WHEN IT'S NOT IN USE,
IT TAKES UP JUST INCHES
OF YOUR VALUABLE SPACE.
OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT,
THE PROFILE RACK,
IS A SLIM RIG THAT
EASILY TRANSFORMS ANY SPACE
INTO A MULTI-FUNCTIONING GYM.
YOU CAN SQUAT.
YOU CAN BENCH-PRESS.
YOU CAN DO PULL-UPS.
BUT WHEN NOT IN USE,
IT FOLDS AWAY,
TAKING UP JUST A FEW INCHES
ON YOUR WALL.
OUR DESIGNS NOW ALLOW
FOR REAL GYM EQUIPMENT
TO BE USED IN SPACES
THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE --
YOUR GARAGE, YOUR BASEMENT,
YOUR SMALL COMMERCIAL SPACE.
ANYPLACE
CAN NOW BE A REAL GYM.
"INCREDIBLE!"
"AMAZING!"
"BEST INVESTMENT
I EVER MADE!"
SHARKS, THESE ARE
JUST A FEW THINGS
YOU MIGHT BE SAYING
AFTER TODAY.
SO, WHICH ONE OF YOU SHARKS
WANT TO HELP US
SHAKE UP THE FITNESS SPACE
BY TAKING UP
AS LITTLE SPACE AS POSSIBLE?
Herjavec: TELL US A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HOW IT WORKS.
HOW DOES IT LOCK INTO PLACE?
'CAUSE YOU HAVE
AN ENTIRE STRUCTURE BEHIND YOU.
YEP, SO,
IT'S MADE TO BE ATTACHED
ON 16 INCH ON CENTER
OR 2 FOOT ON CENTER STUDS.
BUT DO I NEED
ALL OF THAT BEHIND IT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Greiner:
NO, YOU JUST NEED A WALL.
YOU JUST NEED A WALL.
A VERY STABLE WALL.
A STRUCTURAL --
A STRONG WALL.
MOST OF THE WEIGHT IS ON
THE TWO ACTUAL POSTS, RIGHT?
EXACTLY.
RIGHT.
SO,
HE'LL PULL IT DOWN
AND PUT IT IN
THE USABLE POSITION AGAIN.
Herjavec:
YEAH. HOW DO I ADJUST IT?
CAN I MAKE IT GO UP AND DOWN,
THE TOP BAR?
ABSOLUTELY.
WHEN YOU INSTALL IT,
YOU CAN PUT THAT
WHEREVER
YOU'D LIKE IT TO BE.
DOES IT COME
WITH THE WEIGHTS?
OR DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE
YOUR OWN SET?
WE SELL JUST THE RACK
AS YOU SEE IT MOUNTED
TO THE WALL SEPARATELY.
AND WE ALSO HAVE
ABOUT 30 OTHER PRODUCTS
THAT WE'VE DESIGNED
THAT COMPLEMENT THIS WELL.
HOW MUCH IS IT?
THIS RIG RIGHT HERE,
OUR COMMERCIAL LINE,
IS $1,099 RETAIL.
IS THERE A CONSUMER LINE?
John: THAT'S A LOT.
THERE IS. WE'RE JUST
LAUNCHING NOW A STANDARD LINE.
HOW MUCH WOULD
A CONSUMER ONE BE?
THEY START AT $550.
WHO ASSEMBLES IT?
AND WHO PUTS IT UP ON THE WALL?
ASSEMBLY IS THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF THE END USER.
HOW EASY
IS THE INSTALLATION?
CAN YOU DO IT 5 MINUTES?
IS IT 30 MINUTES?
NO. ONE TO TWO HOURS
IS WHAT WE SAY.
-OKAY.
-HOW'D YOU COME UP WITH THIS?
WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN THE FITNESS INDUSTRY NOW
FOR THREE AND FOUR YEARS,
AND AS WE GOT INTO IT,
WE JUST SAW OPPORTUNITY.
WE HAD A LARGE COMPETITOR
IN THAT SPACE.
THEY WERE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE
TO BUY EQUIPMENT
AND FILL UP
THEIR ENTIRE GARAGE STALL
AND WORK OUT
IN THEIR GYM.
AND, BEING FROM
FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA --
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
VISIT THERE IN FEBRUARY.
[ LAUGHS ]
WE CAN'T GIVE UP
OUR GARAGE STALL.
WE GOT TO FIGURE --
I MEAN, I SAID,
"WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO THIS."
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THIS?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
IT IS PATENT PENDING.
WE WERE THE PIONEERS.
WE WERE THE VERY FIRST
TO LAUNCH THIS THING.
THERE'S TWO
PRETTY BIG COMPANIES
THAT HAVE SINCE
RELEASED SOMETHING.
THEY ARE IN VIOLATION
OF OUR CLAIMS
IF OUR PATENT'S ACCEPTED
THE WAY IT IS.
YOU'RE ASSUMING
YOU HAVE A PATENT COMING.
THEY'RE VIOLATING IT.
THIS IS GOING TO BE
VERY IMPORTANT,
'CAUSE KEVIN'S GONNA
MAKE YOU AN OFFER
IF YOU'RE GONNA SUE THEM
INTO THE STONE AGE.
[ LAUGHS ]
HAVE YOU GONE TO
THE PATENT TRADEMARK OFFICE
AND SAID THERE'S AN INFRINGEMENT
TO TRY AND FAST-TRACK IT?
Cuban: OKAY, WELL, INSTEAD OF
TALKING ABOUT BEING LITIGIOUS,
LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR BUSINESS.
WHAT?
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SELLING?
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU BEEN SELLING?
WE STARTED SELLING THIS PRODUCT
Q3 OF LAST YEAR.
THIS YEAR, SO FAR, WE'VE DONE
A LITTLE OVER $170,000.
AND HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD
SINCE Q3?
WE JUST CROSSED
100 UNITS.
AND DID YOU MAKE MONEY?
WE MADE MONEY
THIS QUARTER,
HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOT
TAKEN SALARIES YET.
WHAT'S YOUR GROSS MARGIN
ON THESE NEW UNITS?
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE AT A 43%.
WE WILL ACTUALLY
GET IT UP TO 50%.
Cuban: YEAH, YOU HAVE TO,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SO MUCH CAPITAL OUTLAY
FOR INVENTORY.
YOU HAVE TO TURN A LOT.
AND, GUYS, THAT'S REALLY
MY PROBLEM, RIGHT?
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GOOD
FOR TWO GUYS OWNING A BUSINESS
TRYING TO MAKE SOME MONEY.
BUT TO COME IN
AND BRING IN AN INVESTOR,
THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING,
RIGHT?
BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO START
WORRYING ABOUT OUR RETURN
OR REINVESTING
IN THE COMPANY,
AND YOU'RE
WAY, WAY, WAY TOO EARLY.
YOU GUYS ARE TWO GUYS
THAT HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT,
BUT I JUST THINK
IT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT FOR ME.
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
AND WE ACTUALLY,
IN ADDITION TO THE $80,000,
WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR
A LINE OF CREDIT, AS WELL.
GUYS, I LOVE
THE FITNESS INDUSTRY.
I'VE DONE A BUNCH
OF INVESTMENTS HERE.
HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A LOT OF
MONEY IN THE FITNESS BUSINESS,
YOU WANT A PRODUCT THAT APPEALS
TO A VERY WIDE GROUP OF PEOPLE
THAT'S EASY TO USE.
THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS IS, IT'S
GONNA SCARE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
IT'S TECHNICAL, IT LOOKS
COMPLICATED, IT LOOKS HARD.
THE IDEA OF ME ASSEMBLING THIS
IS NEVER GONNA WORK.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FIND A STUD IN A WALL.
I THINK IT'S NOT GONNA APPEAL
TO A WIDE-ENOUGH BASE OF PEOPLE
WHERE I CAN INVEST
AND SEE IT SCALE.
I'M OUT.
I KNOW HOW TO FIND
A STUD IN A WALL.
ALL RIGHT!
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL, SO THAT'S...
ALL KIDDING ASIDE,
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.
WE HAVE ALSO HAVE
LICENSING INTERESTS.
IT'S A GREAT SPACE-SAVER.
I DON'T THINK
IT LOOKS DIFFICULT TO INSTALL.
BUT I HOPE YOU GET YOUR PATENT,
AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO REALLY MOVE FORWARD
IN THIS SPACE.
RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE EARLY FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
THANKS, LORI.
THANK YOU, LORI.
APPRECIATE IT.
John: I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THIS SPACE FAIRLY WELL.
THERE ARE TWO TYPE OF USERS.
THIS USER
WHO'S THE ENTHUSIAST,
99% OF THEM
PUT IT UNDERNEATH THEIR BED,
AND THEY NEED TO BUY A DUSTER
WITH THE EQUIPMENT
BECAUSE THEY NEVER USE IT.
OR YOU HAVE THE ENTHUSIAST
WHO GOES AND PAYS $300 A MONTH
TO BE A MEMBER.
I SEE THIS
AS BEING THAT AREA
WHERE IT'S VERY, VERY HARD
TO GRAB ONE OR THE OTHER.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
AND THEN THERE WAS ONLY KEVIN,
THE FITTEST SHARK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UM, I-I LIKE IT.
I'M SORT OF CONNECTING WITH IT,
'CAUSE MY WIFE'S PUTTING A GYM
INTO OUR BASEMENT RIGHT NOW
AT OUR LAKE HOUSE,
AND SHE'S RUN INTO
THIS PROBLEM.
AND I THINK IT'S
A VERY INTERESTING SOLUTION.
HOW WOULD YOU PAY BACK
AN INVESTOR
THAT GAVE YOU $80,000?
YOU PUT AN $800,000 VALUE
ON THIS.
I HAVE NO IDEA
IF IT'S WORTH THAT OR NOT.
BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS,
WE'LL SELL
ANOTHER 300 UNITS THIS YEAR.
THAT'S THE WAY
WE'RE TRENDING RIGHT NOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE AVERAGE
SELLING PRICE WILL BE
ON THOSE 300 UNITS?
PROBABLY AROUND $700.
I'D LOOK AT IT THIS WAY --
I'D GIVE YOU THE $80,000
FOR 20%.
AND THE WAY I WOULD STRUCTURE
THE PAYBACK WOULD BE,
AS YOU PAY YOURSELVES 80%,
I GET 20%.
YOU NEED THE CAPITAL
FOR THE FIRST 100 UNITS.
I THINK
IT'S AN ELOQUENT SOLUTION.
AND I'M ASSUMING
THE PATENT'S GONNA HOLD UP.
BY THE WAY, I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO SUE THOSE GUYS
INTO THE STONE AGE.
[ LAUGHS ]
WAITING FOR THAT.
YEP.
WONDERFUL.
THAT'S AWESOME.
GUYS, NO ONE ELSE
HAS MADE YOU AN OFFER.
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT BELIEVES IN YOU.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
LET'S DO IT.
YOU GOT A DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO TO WORK.
Cuban: CONGRATS, GUYS.
Greiner: CONGRATS, GUYS.
-THANKS A LOT, GUYS.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
-LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
HEY, GUYS,
WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE,
CAN WE SEE KEVIN
DO A CHIN-UP?
ROBERT, I DON'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU, GUYS,
VERY MUCH.
YEAH! WHOO!
[ LAUGHS ]
THOSE ARE GREAT GUYS --
JUST REALLY BAD
JUDGE OF CHARACTER.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
KEVIN COME BACK RIPPED.
[ LAUGHTER ]
