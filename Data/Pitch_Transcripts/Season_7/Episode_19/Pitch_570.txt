HI. MY NAME'S RACHEL NILSSON,
AND I AM FROM ALPINE, UTAH.
I AM SEEKING $200,000
FOR 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY COMPANY
CALLED RAGS TO RACHES.
WHAT STARTED AS A SIDE BUSINESS
SELLING MY KIDS'
HAND-ME-DOWN CLOTHING
TO HELP MAKE ENDS MEET
ENDED UP
BECOMING A FASHION FRENZY.
WE CALL THIS THE ROMPER.
IT'S A ONE-PIECE OUTFIT
THAT'S SUPER-EASY
TO SLIDE ON AND OFF
YOUR WRIGGLY TODDLER
WITHOUT THE HASSLE
OF DEALING WITH SNAPS.
I STARTED POSTING THESE
ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA,
AND THE RESPONSE WAS CRAZINESS.
PARENTS LOVED THE FACT
THAT THEY WERE SUPER-COMFORTABLE
AND STYLISH,
BUT THEY'RE ALSO VERY PRACTICAL.
SINCE LAUNCH,
THESE HAVE BEEN IN HIGH DEMAND.
IT'S BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITED RUNS
AND OUR SUPER-EXCLUSIVE DESIGNS.
NOW I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU GUYS
THE ROMPER IN ACTION.
CHLOE! HARRISON!
[ LAUGHTER ]
AWW!
SHARK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-COME ON!
-OH, MY GOD, THAT'S CUTE.
-OH, MY GOD.
-HI!
SAY "HI."
WHO'S WHO?
OKAY, THIS IS
MY LITTLE GUY HARRISON.
HI, HARRISON.
AND THIS IS CHLOE.
HI, CHLOE.
Greiner: HI, CHLOE.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THEY'RE BOTH WEARING
TWO DIFFERENT STYLES OF ROMPERS,
BOTH EQUALLY JUST AS STYLISH.
AND WE'RE NOT HAVING TO
NEGOTIATE AT ALL ON COMFORT.
SHARKS, I WANT TO GET THESE
IN THE HANDS OF EVERY
STYLISH PARENT OUT THERE.
NOW THEY'RE GONNA HELP US
HAND OUT SOME SAMPLES.
CAN YOU HAND HIM
THE TOP ONE?
VERY GOOD.
OH, THANK YOU.
OKAY,
AND NOW OUR FRIEND LORI.
THANK YOU, HONEY.
OH, WATCH YOUR STEP.
DO YOU WANT TO GET UP
ON THE STAIR?
CHLOE, DON'T GET TOO CLOSE
TO MR. O'LEARY.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU.
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY. AND NOW
OUR FRIEND DAYMOND.
THANK YOU.
AND THEN MARK.
WHAT'S UP, CHLOE?
THANK YOU.
CAN YOU SAY "GOODBYE"?
CAN YOU SAY "BYE"?
Chloe: BYE-BYE!
All: BYE-BYE!
O'Leary: SO, RACHEL,
I HAVE A BURNING QUESTION.
YES, PLEASE.
HOW WOULD A CHILD HAVE
A "PEE-PEE" IN ONE OF THESE?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE GET ASKED THIS QUESTION
ALL OF THE TIME.
THEY LITERALLY SLIDE DOWN
AND UP, AND IT'S NO HASSLE.
PARENTS LOVE THE FACT THEY'RE
SUPER-EASY TO PULL ON AND OFF.
SO, THIS STRETCHES
ALL THE WAY DOWN?
ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
THE NECKLINE IS REINFORCED
WITH ELASTIC.
SO THE CHILD
PULLS IT --
SO, RACHEL,
THAT'S THE UNIQUE PART.
TOTALLY. YEAH.
WHAT AGE DOES THIS GO TO?
USUALLY, THE BIGGEST SELLERS
ARE INFANT/TODDLER AREA.
RIGHT.
BUT WE HAVE HAD, LIKE,
A 5- AND 6-YEAR-OLD CHILD
WEARING THOSE.
AND HOW MANY
COLORS AND STYLES?
THAT'S THE UNIQUE THING
ABOUT OUR BRAND,
IS WE'RE CONSTANTLY COMING OUT
WITH LIMITED-EDITION.
SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DRIVE PEOPLE TO OUR WEBSITE
ALL OF THE TIME.
RACHEL,
WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD?
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR,
AND OUR SALES ARE $792,000.
-WHOA.
-GOOD FOR YOU.
FROM -- FROM ZERO?
Nilsson: FROM ZERO.
FROM A COLD START?
-ALL ONLINE?
-YES.
I STARTED THIS BECAUSE
MY HUSBAND WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL.
WE WERE BROKE AS A JOKE,
AND I DECIDED, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LIKE, "I NEED
TO DO SOMETHING HERE."
I HAVE THREE SONS.
I PULLED OUT
THEIR HAND-ME-DOWN CLOTHING,
I CAME UP WITH AN INSTAGRAM
NAME, "RAGS TO RACHES,"
AND I STARTED SELLING
MY KIDS HAND-ME-DOWN CLOTHING.
I WAS NOTICING THAT THE QUICKEST
THINGS THAT WERE SELLING
WERE THE STUFF
THAT I MADE FOR THEM.
SO I CUT A ROMPER
OUT OF MY HUSBAND'S T-SHIRT,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"THIS IS AWESOME."
SO, OUT OF THE $792,000,
IS IT ALL ROMPERS?
NO.
MAJORITY IS, THOUGH.
I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
95% IS ROMPERS.
ARE ALL YOUR SALES
ONLINE?
ACTUALLY, 12% OF OUR SALES
ARE WHOLESALE.
BUT 88% ARE ONLINE.
YES. YEAH.
THOSE 12% ARE GOING
TO RETAILER STORES?
SO, I'VE STUCK WITH, LIKE,
LITTLE BOUTIQUES
BECAUSE I'M SO AFRAID
OF WHOLESALE.
YOU SHOULD BE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
TOTALLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE
HANDCUFFED BY MY RETAILERS.
I LOVE THE ONLINE BUSINESS
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE MONEY'S AT.
Cuban: WELL, YEAH, OKAY.
THAT'S AWESOME.
SO, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KILLING IT, RACHEL.
IF YOU DID 700-SOME-THOUSAND
DOLLARS IN SALES,
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE MADE
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
THIS YEAR.
YEAH, WE'RE PREDICTED
TO DO ALMOST A MILLION.
LIKE, WE'LL PROBABLY --
NO, NO.
I'M TALKING ABOUT PROFIT.
WHAT'S YOUR PROFIT?
PROFIT -- PROFIT, WE'RE DOING --
IT'S LIKE $280,000.
WHY AREN'T YOU
MAKING MORE?
OUR COSTS. LIKE, WE NEED TO GET
OUR COSTS IN THIS --
WHAT ARE YOUR MARGINS?
SO, THE COST TO GET THOSE MADE
IS BETWEEN $7 AND $10.
WE'RE SELLING THEM
FOR 37 TO 50 BUCKS.
WHY ISN'T YOUR PROFIT
WAY HIGHER?
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE MONEY GOING?
SO, WE ARE, LIKE --
OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S KIND OF WHY
I NEED YOUR GUYS' HELP.
A LOT OF MY PROFITS
IS SUCKED UP INTO MATERIAL.
IT'S YOUR INVENTORY,
YEAH.
YEAH, MY INVENTORY.
O'Leary:
RACHEL, ARE YOU WORRIED,
WHEN SOMEBODY SEES THIS,
THEY COULD SIMPLY KNOCK IT OFF
AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE?
YEAH. I AM SO GLAD YOU ASKED
THAT, BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY --
SO AM I, ACTUALLY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE'VE RUN INTO --
WE'VE RUN INTO PEOPLE
TRYING TO KNOCK OFF RAGS.
WHAT STOPS THEM?
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
THE COOLEST PART IS
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE
WE'VE ESTABLISHED A BRAND.
PEOPLE LOVE RAGS.
THEY LOVE THE UNIQUENESS OF IT.
I FEEL LIKE I POUR A LITTLE BIT
OF ME INTO THE BRAND,
I PUT A FACE ON IT,
AND THEY LOVE THAT.
WELL, LET'S TAP INTO OUR
RESIDENT CLOTHING EXPERT HERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT STATEMENT, DAYMOND --
THAT IT'S PROTECTABLE
BY BRAND ALONE?
THAT IT'LL PROTECT HER.
NO. NOT AT ALL.
I THINK THAT SHE HAS
A GREAT FOLLOWING,
BUT IF ANOTHER MAKER --
AND THEY <i>WILL</i> COPY IT --
PUTS IT OUT THERE...
THIS IS A BIG WORLD,
YOU KNOW?
YEAH, TOTALLY.
THEY JUST WOULDN'T --
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST WOULDN'T --
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
AND WHAT WOULD THEY
SELL IT FOR? SHE'S AT 50 BUCKS.
WHAT WOULD THEY SELL IT?
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CHAIN.
SO, IF THIS WAS GOING INTO
THE MASS MARKET,
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
$19.99.
AT THE MOST.
YEAH, AT THE MOST.
SO, RACHEL, YOU'RE ASKING
FOR $200,000.
Nilsson: YEAH.
YOU MADE $280,000
IN PROFITS.
YEAH.
HOW MUCH OF THAT
DO YOU STILL HAVE LEFT?
I HAVE ALMOST ALL OF THAT.
SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR LESS
THAN YOU HAVE IN CASH ALREADY.
I HAVE TWO --
I THINK I HAVE $215,000
SITTING IN MY BANK ACCOUNT
RIGHT NOW.
SO, WHAT IS THE CASH
GONNA DO FOR YOU TO MAR--
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
$215,000.
I NEED <i>MORE</i> INVENTORY.
OKAY, BUT HANG ON.
DO YOU WANT MORE INVENTORY
TO GO TO WHOLESALE?
IS THAT WHAT --
NO. THIS IS MY POINT.
ALL THE RETAILERS THAT WE HAVE
APPROVED TO PUT IN THEIR STORES,
THEY ALL SOLD OUT
OF THEIR PRODUCT,
AND THEY'RE COMING TO US,
AND WE HAVE TO SAY, "NO.
WE CAN'T GIVE THAT TO YOU.
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH."
SO THIS IS JUST
THE RETAILER SIDE
THAT YOU WANT TO
CREATE THAT FOR.
YEAH, YOU KNOW --
BUT ARE YOU SURE -- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO GO INTO RETAILERS?
I'M <i>NOT</i> SURE.
I'M NOT SURE.
SO, RACHEL,
WHAT'S THE DIRECTION?
LIKE, I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT
"I'M AN EXCLUSIVE BRAND,"
THEN I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT
MORE CASH FOR RETAIL.
I'M SO GLAD
YOU MENTIONED THAT, SO...
LIKE, WHAT --
WHAT'S THE STRATEGY?
I REALLY WOULDN'T MIND
BRANCHING OUT.
HERE'S THE DEAL.
I GO INTO --
AND THAT MEANS
GOING INTO RETAIL?
IF I GO INTO RETAIL,
I DON'T WANT TO BE COMPETING
WITH MYSELF ONLINE.
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS WE'VE CREATED
A TOTALLY EXCLUSIVE LINE
FOR OUR RETAILERS.
I WONDER
IF THAT'S GONNA WORK,
BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE
IN MARGINS TO YOU IS MATERIAL.
THE RETAIL SALE
IS HALF THE PROFIT
THAT YOU'RE MAKING
SELLING DIRECT.
YEAH.
I'M JUST WONDERING WHY.
I MEAN, IT'S WORKING
SO WELL FOR YOU.
YEAH, WHY NOT KEEP
DRIVING IT ONLINE?
WHY NOT KEEP ENGAGING?
LIKE, MAYBE WE WILL,
YOU KNOW?
THAT'S KIND OF WHERE --
RACHEL,
HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
I AGREE WITH THESE GUYS
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
YOU'RE KILLING IT.
YOU MAY BE --
KILLING IT.
YOU MAY BE
THE MOST PROFITABLE
FROM A SALES-TO-NET-PROFIT
COMPANY
THAT WE'VE HAD ON HERE
IN A LONG TIME.
WOW.
WHY SCREW IT UP?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S LIKE...
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU, MARK,
AND I AM --
BUT YOU DIDN'T, THOUGH,
RIGHT?
BECAUSE ON ONE HAND,
"TOTALLY. AWESOME. IT'S GREAT.
I AGREE WITH YOU, MARK."
BUT THEN,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT'S, "OH, YEAH,
RETAIL STORES," RIGHT?
"TOTALLY. AWESOME."
HERE'S THE DEAL.
"WE WANT TO DO IT."
HERE'S THE DEAL.
I WOULD GO NUTS.
I WOULD GO NUTS.
HERE'S THE DEAL, MARK.
I AM NOT SURE
IF I WANT TO GO THAT ROUTE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY
A WHOLE NOTHER GAME,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU SHOULD PLAY.
YOU'VE SEEN
OTHER PEOPLE PLAY,
"SO MAYBE I SHOULD PLAY BECAUSE
OTHER COMPANIES ARE BIGGER."
YOU ARE GREAT
AT DESIGNING...
YEAH.
...GETTING PEOPLE
TO TRUST YOU,
AND SELLING THEM
A GREAT PRODUCT ONLINE
AT HUGE MARGINS
THAT'S PROFITABLE TO YOU.
I LOVE IT.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT THEN,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WHEN SOMEONE ELSE
TALKS TO YOU, RIGHT...
"WHOLESALE!"
"'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW."
HERE'S THE DEAL --
"HERE'S THE DEAL,
RIGHT?"
RACHEL, YOU'VE EXCEEDED
MY "HERE'S THE DEAL" QUOTA.
YOU CAN'T MAKE UP YOUR MIND
ABOUT MAKING UP YOUR MIND.
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANKS, MARK.
THANK YOU.
RACHEL, YOUR PRODUCT
IS NOT DEFENSIBLE.
ABSOLUTELY.
MY CHALLENGE IS,
WHAT DO <i>YOU</i> WANT TO DO?
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
I WANT TO BE <i>MRS.</i> WONDERFUL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WANT TO MAKE --
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE
MRS. WONDERFUL.
MAYBE I TOOK IT TOO FAR.
OH, I LOVE THAT.
RACHEL,
YOU'RE AUTHENTIC.
YOU'RE SELLING SOMETHING
THAT YOU WOULD USE.
IT'S A VERY AUTHENTIC --
AND THAT'S WHAT
GREAT BRANDS ARE.
HEY, ROBERT, ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE HER AN OFFER?
YEAH,
I'M GONNA MAKE AN OFFER.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $200,000 FOR 20%.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW, RACHEL,
I'VE GOT MULTIPLE COMPANIES NOW
INVOLVED WITH YOUNG FAMILIES,
AROUND WEDDINGS, ENGAGEMENTS --
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF USERS.
IT'S CALLED THE
SOMETHING WONDERFUL PLATFORM.
WE PUSH CUSTOMERS
AT A ZERO COST BASE
TO EACH OTHER.
I THINK YOU COULD
FIT NICELY IN IT
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE
HAVE CHILDREN.
SO I LIKE IT
FOR MY PORTFOLIO.
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THE RETAIL BUSINESS VERY MUCH.
OKAY. COOL.
AND SO I HAVE
A PLATFORM FOR YOU,
I'VE GOT LOGISTICS FOR YOU,
I'VE GOT --
DO YOU HAVE AN OFFER
FOR HER?
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
FOR 20%.
'CAUSE I THINK --
Greiner: WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT ROBERT OFFERED YOU.
THIS IS BASICALLY WORTH
ONE-TIME SALES.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET TO
$1 MILLION IN SALES.
YEAH, WE SHOULD GET TO
$1 MILLION FOR SURE BY DECEMBER.
I DON'T DOUBT THAT AT ALL.
SPEAKING OF
PORTFOLIO COMPANIES,
WE HAVE A COMPANY
CALLED TIPSY ELVES.
GREAT GUYS. THEY WERE DOING
$600,000 A YEAR.
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD
OVER THREE YEARS ABOUT GOING
THIS WAY, ABOUT GOING THAT WAY.
YEAH.
THREE YEARS LATER,
YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE?
WE'RE AN ONLINE COMPANY...
LOVE IT.
...THAT'LL DO OVER $15 MILLION
THIS YEAR.
WE'VE EXPANDED
THE PRODUCT LINE
BUT ALWAYS STAY TRUE
TO THE CORE.
THAT'S INTERESTING.
GOING DOWN KEVIN'S ROUTE,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ELIMINATED.
BUT THE SOMETHING WONDERFUL
PLATFORM
HAS HALF A BILLION IN SALES,
$500 MILLION THROUGH IT.
John: WELL --
THIS IS NOTHING.
WHILE THEY SQUABBLE,
I'M INTERESTED.
I LIKE THIS.
RACHEL HAS TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE
FOR HER CHILDREN'S
CLOTHING BRAND, RAGS TO RACHES.
BUT DAYMOND
ALSO SEEMS INTERESTED.
John: I'M INTERESTED.
I LIKE THIS.
I KIND OF DISAGREE
WITH THE OTHER GUYS
ABOUT THE RETAIL STRATEGY.
I BELIEVE YOU NEED
TO TAKE THAT COMPETITOR
OUT OF THE MARKET
BY LICENSING
MASS-MARKET DIFFERENT-LEVEL
GOODS TO THAT COMPETITOR
SO THEY CAN THEN NOT KNOCK YOU
OFF AND THEY CAN --
KILLS YOUR BRAND.
THEY CAN PROTECT YOU
SO YOU CAN DO
THE HIGHER-END, ONLINE SALES
AND THEY DO
THE MASS MARKET
SO THAT NOW YOU'VE GOT
BOTH COVERED.
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE PIECE
OF THIS AND A LOT OF THAT.
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING
KNOCK OFF MYSELF.
BASICALLY
KNOCK OFF YOURSELF.
THEN YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT
TWO BRANDS.
SO, SHE'S A YEAR
IN BUSINESS,
SHE'S GONNA START
ANOTHER BRAND?
THAT'S NOT SO GREAT.
YEAH. PEOPLE DO IT
ALL THE TIME.
WHO I'M GONNA TAKE YOU TO
IS GONNA HAVE 80 LICENSES
TO THROW ON THERE IMMEDIATELY,
AND THEN YOU MAKE MONEY.
SO LET'S HOPE THAT THEY GET
UP TO $50 MILLION A YEAR,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE'RE MAKING
10% OFF THAT $50 MILLION.
SO, I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
THE SAME
WITH AN INTENTION
TO GO LICENSE A SUB-BRAND.
OKAY.
$200,000 FOR 20%.
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE.
YEAH.
HERE'S THE DEAL --
LIKE, ROBERT, TIPSY ELVES,
I'VE FOLLOWED THAT,
AND I'VE SEEN THE GROWTH,
AND I LOVE
THAT THEY ARE ONLINE.
IT SEEMS SIMPLE.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA
COME IN AND WANT TO COPY.
I'D RATHER COPY MYSELF
AND MAKE CLOTHES --
THEY'RE GONNA CRANK IT OUT
NO MATTER WHAT,
SO EITHER
WE'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY
OFF THEM CRANKING IT OUT
OR NOT.
Herjavec:
NO, THAT'S SO NOT TRUE.
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO CONTROL
YOUR INVENTORY COSTS.
ANYBODY CAN ALWAYS
KNOCK OFF ANYTHING.
RIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING
PROPRIETARY.
WHEN YOU CREATE THE BRAND
THAT YOU CAN
AND YOU GET TO $20 MILLION
AND $50 MILLION,
YOU CAN JUST
LICENSE YOUR NAME.
YOU'RE NOT THERE TODAY.
ROBERT, THEY'RE NOT PUTTING --
IT DOESN'T WORK.
THEY'RE NOT PUTTING
THE NAME ON --
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING
RAGS TO RACHES ON IT.
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA LICENSE?
A JUMPER
WITH AN ELASTIC BAND?
IF SOMEBODY WANTED
TO LICENSE THAT TODAY --
YEAH,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT --
THE BIG BOYS AND GIRLS
ARE DOING THAT NOW.
WILL SHE MAKE MONEY
OFF OF THAT?
LISTEN, I'VE DONE THIS WITH
30 DIFFERENT APPAREL COMPANIES.
RACHEL,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
THEY'RE TALKING
WITH LIMITED UNDERSTANDING
BECAUSE THEY DID
ONE OR TWO.
LORI, ARE WE GONNA
HEAR FROM YOU OR NOT?
WHILE WE'RE STILL YOUNG?
LORI,
YOU DON'T HAVE AN OFFER?
I WOULD OFFER YOU SOMETHING
THAT'S JUST THE SAME AS DAYMOND,
BUT DAYMOND'S GREAT
AT DOING THAT.
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT
GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
BUT I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU, LORI.
OKAY. YOU GOT
THREE SHARKS INTERESTED.
THE OFFERS ARE IDENTICAL.
YOU HAVE TO
MAKE A DECISION.
ROBERT, ARE YOU WILLING TO
GO DOWN TO 15% FOR $200,000?
DO WE HAVE A DEAL
IF I DO?
OR ARE YOU GONNA CONTINUE
NEGOTIATING?
YOUR WHOLE BUSINESS IS WORTH
THE DIFFERENCE OF 5%?
NO.
THAT'S WHAT
THE PARTNER IS WORTH?
DOES IT REALLY MAKE
THAT BIG A DIFFERENCE, 5%?
MAYBE NOT, BUT --
RACHEL,
HERE'S MY QUESTION.
IF I GO DOWN TO 15%,
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
DO YOU WANT A PARTNER
WHO IS NOT THAT VESTED IN IT?
ROBERT, WE HAVE A DEAL.
DONE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU!
GOOD JOB!
THANK YOU, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
[ SQUEALS ]
I JUST CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT I STARTED TOTALLY BROKE,
SELLING MY KIDS' HAND-ME-DOWNS,
AND A LITTLE OVER A YEAR,
AND I'M HERE AS A MOM
WITH THREE YOUNG BOYS,
AND I MADE THIS WORK,
AND I MADE MY COMPANY A SUCCESS,
AND I'M SO PROUD OF MYSELF
AND MY FAMILY.
