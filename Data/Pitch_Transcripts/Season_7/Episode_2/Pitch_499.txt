HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JESSE WOLFE.
I'M A UCF STUDENT
FROM ORLANDO, FLORIDA,
AND MY COMPANY IS O'DANG HUMMUS.
TODAY, WE ARE SEEKING $50,000
FOR 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY HUMMUS EMPIRE.
HUMMUS -- IT IS A DISH
THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ENJOYING
FOR YEARS --
900 YEARS, TO BE EXACT.
THIS ANCIENT DISH IS HANDCRAFTED
WITH CHICKPEAS, LEMON JUICE,
AND, OF COURSE, GARLIC,
RIGHT?
MMM.
JESSE, WHAT ARE THE FLAVORS
WE'RE TRYING?
THE GREEN ONE IS
OUR DILLIONAIRE DILL PICKLE.
YEAH!
THE BLACK ONE IN THE MIDDLE
IS OUR SWEET &amp; SPICY BLACK BEAN.
WE TOOK
ALL THE CHICKPEAS OUT,
AND WE PUT
A WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAN IN.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
IT'S SUPER-CREAMY.
YEAH.
THAT ONE'S REALLY GOOD.
WE WANT TO BREAK DOWN
THE ETHNIC BARRIER OF HUMMUS.
SABRA'S THE BIG, YOU KNOW,
GUY IN THE MARKET,
WITH OVER, YOU KNOW, 64%
OF THE MARKET SHARE,
AND THEY DO
THE TRADITIONAL FLAVORS.
YOU'RE A HEALTHIER-FLAVORED
HUMMUS.
THE CHALLENGE IS,
IT'S IN THE REFRIGERATED
PART OF MOST STORES.
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?
OKAY.
OKAY, I'M ABOUT TO BLOW
YOUR MIND. BRACE YOURSELVES.
OH, NO.
SO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE ARE BRINGING OUT
A NEW PRODUCT WHICH
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON.
WHAT IS IT?
THIS IS
A HUMMUS SALAD DRESSING.
SO, THESE ARE REALLY COOL.
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA BE BOTTLED,
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE SHELF-STABLE
FOR TWO YEARS.
TWO YEARS?
YEAH.
THIS IS A RANCH ON RANCH.
THIS IS
OUR BUFFALO WING DRESSING.
AND, THEN,
THIS IS OUR HUMMY MUSTARD,
OUR TAKE
OF A HONEY MUSTARD.
YEAH, SO YOU'RE
MORE THAN WELCOME TO TRY THAT.
AND WHAT'S GREAT
ABOUT THOSE SALAD DRESSINGS,
NOT ONLY ARE THEY
SHELF-STABLE --
OKAY.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
YOU LIKE IT?
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?
IS IT GONNA
BLOW MY MIND?
YEAH -- OIL-FREE.
WHAT?!
AND WE'VE SHOWED THEM
TO BIG RETAILERS,
AND THEY ARE GOING NUTS
OVER THEM.
GOING NUTS LIKE
WRITING YOU A PURCHASE ORDER?
SO, WE ARE GOING BACK
WITH OUR SECOND MEETING
WITH PUBLIX GROCERY STORE.
WE'RE GOING BACK
FOR 1,100 GROCERY STORES
IN TWO WEEKS
TO FINALIZE THAT DEAL.
SO,
IF THIS ALL WORKS OUT,
WHAT WILL SALES BE
IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR?
THIS CALENDAR YEAR,
$1.3 MILLION.
AND WHAT ARE THEY HERE,
JUST UP TO DATE?
HOW MANY TO DATE?
WE JUST STARTED
OFFICIALLY SELLING.
SO, HERE'S
WHAT HAPPENED --
SO YOU HAVE NO SALES
RIGHT NOW?
NO, WE ACCIDENTALLY SOLD
$70,000 IN PRODUCTS.
IT'S CONFUSING.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SO, HERE'S WHAT I DID.
I ENTERED A COUPLE
BUSINESS PLANS AT MY COLLEGE.
IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A TEST
13 MONTHS AGO.
WE HAVE
A BUNCH OF FARMERS MARKETS.
I JUST WANTED TO PROVE
THAT THERE WAS A DEMAND.
NOW, IT TOOK OFF
LIKE A FREAKIN' ROCKET.
WE BECAME
AN ORLANDO SENSATION.
WE WERE IN 10 FARMERS MARKETS
WITHIN 3 MONTHS,
AND I STEPPED BACK, AND I SAID,
"I CAN DO IT AT GROCERY STORES."
WHAT WERE YOU
SELLING THEM FOR?
$5 A TUB
FOR AN 8-OUNCE TUB.
$5 A TUB.
WHEN YOU GET INTO
PUBLIX'S 1,100 STORES --
WHICH IS INTERESTING,
OKAY?
YEAH.
IF YOU GET IN, WHY WOULD
THEY ROLL OUT 1,100 STORES
WITHOUT TESTING IT
IN 10?
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED
WITH PUBLIX.
WE SIMPLY HAD A MEETING
SET UP.
THREE DAYS
BEFORE WE HAD THE MEETING,
WE PUT OUT ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA,
"HEY, GUYS, IF YOU GET A CHANCE,
PRINT OFF THIS FLIER,
TAKE IT INTO YOUR STORE,
AND JUST REQUEST
O'DANG HUMMUS.
SHOW THEM, YOU KNOW,
'HEY, WE'RE INTERESTED.'"
'CAUSE WE HAD A FAN BASE.
THAT'S PRETTY CLEVER.
VERY CLEVER.
IT IS,
BUT THINGS WENT ROGUE.
UH-OH.
AND THEY TOOK TO FACEBOOK,
AND THEY CRASHED
PUBLIX'S FACEBOOK IN TWO DAYS.
IT WAS KIND OF AWESOME, BECAUSE
THEY HAD TO CALL US AND SAY,
"LISTEN,
WE KNOW YOU'RE COMING."
WE'RE THE ONLY COMPANY
THAT'S EVER LOCKED UP
THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA.
YOU'VE GOT AN ANGLE,
RIGHT?
RIGHT.
AND IT'S A GREAT ANGLE.
THAT BLACK-BEAN STUFF
IS THE [BLEEP]
IT'S GOOD, YOU KNOW?
[ LAUGHS ]
JESSE, WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS
ON THE PUBLIX DEAL?
WHAT DO YOU MAKE IT FOR?
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
OKAY, GREAT.
SO, WE ACTUALLY
WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT
THROUGH OUR CO-PACKER
AT THE VERY FIRST RUN FOR $1.25.
WITH SCALE, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO REDUCE THAT DOWN TO 85 CENTS.
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING IT
TO THEM?
WE'RE WHOLESALING IT
FOR $2.25.
SO RIGHT NOW
WE'RE RUNNING A 40% MARGIN.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
SO, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.
I'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE
FOR NINE YEARS.
I SHOULD BE A DOCTOR.
YOUR PARENTS MUST BE HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.
THEY ARE THRILLED.
I GOT A FULL-TIME JOB RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE OF MY COLLEGE CAREER.
WELL, THANK GOD YOU DID.
FOR EIGHT YEARS, THANK GOD
YOU HAD A FULL-TIME JOB.
YEAH, YEAH.
WHAT WAS THE JOB?
I STARTED WORKING FOR AutoZone.
I WAS IN SALES.
I WAS ABLE TO CASH IN
MY 401(k)
THAT I EARNED THERE,
MY STOCK OPTIONS.
I WAS ABLE TO CASH IN
MY SAVINGS.
SO, AND THAT'S WHAT'S KEPT ME,
YOU KNOW,
PAYING MYSELF
FOR THE LAST YEAR.
AND ALL OF IT
WENT INTO THIS?
EVERY --
SO YOU'RE ALL-IN.
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU PUT IN?
ABOUT $40,000.
JESSE,
WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GET THE P.O.
FROM PUBLIX?
I'M REALLY FOCUSED
ON THAT.
THREE WEEKS.
THREE WEEKS.
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET
A PHYSICAL ORDER?
I <i>KNOW</i>
WE'LL GET A PHYSICAL ORDER.
JESSE,
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BREATH.
SORRY.
YOU TALK
MORE THAN THE SHARKS.
I GET REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT HUMMUS.
NO, I CAN SEE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.
BUT I HAVE INVESTED
IN SO MANY FOOD BUSINESSES.
YES, MA'AM.
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.
I THINK YOU ARE UNDERESTIMATING
WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE
TO GO INTO
THE BIG-BOX STORES.
IT IS SO EXPENSIVE.
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN, TRUST ME, I'VE CALLED.
I <i>DON'T</i> TRUST YOU -- 'CAUSE
OF YOUR LACK OF EXPERIENCE.
I REALLY DON'T.
BUT I HAVE NEVER MET
A MORE NAIVE PERSON
STANDING THERE ABOUT TO GO
BIG-TIME INTO THE FOOD SPACE.
SO I'M OUT.
BARBARA, I BEG TO DIFFER,
BECAUSE I'VE SPENT
BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS.
I BELIEVE YOU.
I STOOD OUTSIDE
IN 105-DEGREE WEATHER,
TESTING THIS PRODUCT.
I'M NOT NAIVE TO HOW HARD IT IS
TO GET THIS PRODUCT TO SCALE.
JESSE, SO, I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE
A FOOD-PRODUCT INVESTMENT.
OH, FANTASTIC.
AND EVERY TIME
I HEAR ABOUT KEVIN'S CUPCAKES
OF ONE OF BARBARA'S SUCCESSES,
IT JUST IRRITATES ME,
'CAUSE
I'M A COMPETITIVE GUY.
RIGHT,
AND I KNOW THAT.
BUT MORE THAN THAT,
I WISH I HAD THE GUY.
I'M THAT GUY.
YOU'RE THAT GUY?
I'M THAT GUY.
I'M THAT GUY.
OH, GOD.
IT'S IMPRESSIVE
HOW FAR YOU'VE COME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
I'LL GO $50,000, 15%.
THAT'S A -- WOW. THANK YOU.
THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE OFFER.
O'Leary: I'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I <i>AM</i> IN THE FOOD BUSINESS.
YES, SIR.
IT'S EXTREMELY HARD.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE $50,000
FOR 20%.
I WANT TO GET THREE SKUs
AND PURCHASE ORDERS FROM PUBLIX.
I DON'T WANT YOU
DOING ANYTHING ELSE.
OKAY.
BUT IT'S GONNA COST YOU 20%,
'CAUSE I KNOW A LOT MORE
THAN HE DOES ABOUT
THE FOOD BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE LASER-FOCUSED
ON SUCCESS.
RIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO PROVE OUT THAT
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FULFILL PUBLIX
AND MAINTAIN YOUR SKU
IN THE REFRIGERATED SECTION.
IF YOU CAN PROVE THAT OUT, THEN
YOU CAN ROLL IT TO EVERYBODY.
IT'S REALLY TOUGH.
BUT WE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR
ALL OF THAT.
I'VE DONE THE HOMEWORK
ON THAT.
$50,000 RIGHT NOW,
OKAY --
IT'S GONNA GET US
AT LEAST THE FIRST TWO RUNS.
Greiner:
IT'S GREAT TO BE PASSIONATE,
BECAUSE PASSION DOES SELL,
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.
RIGHT.
LORI,
DO YOU HAVE AN OFFER?
WHAT IF YOU AND LORI
WENT IN TOGETHER
FOR $50,000 FOR 15%?
LOOK, JESSE, I --
I WOULD GO IN WITH ROBERT,
BUT NOT FOR 15%.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?
$50,000, 25%.
AND WE'LL FUND --
YOU NEED MONEY.
YEAH.
IF WE GET INTO
ALL OF THESE PLACES,
YOU HAVE TO FUND
ALL OF THIS.
OH, OF COURSE. RIGHT.
$50,000, LORI AND I,
FOR 25%.
WOULD YOU DO $50,000
FOR 20%?
AND I'M YOUR GUY.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU KNOW I'M STILL IN,
RIGHT?
OH.
I WOULD DO THAT.
DONE.
DONE.
DONE.
DONE!
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU BLEW IT.
AH!
YOU BLEW IT.
I'M EXCITED.
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM $100K
FOR 25%.
YEAH!
[ LAUGHS ]
I'M SO EXCITED. IT'S GREAT
PARTNERING WITH YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD LUCK, GUY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS.
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.
BARBARA,
I STILL LOVE YOU.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHOO, BABY!
YES!
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.
IT MEANS THE WORLD.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I QUIT MY JOB, YOU KNOW,
AND [LAUGHS] CASHED IN
MY RETIREMENT AND STUFF,
AND I'VE WORKED SO HARD
TO GET TO THIS VERY POINT.
THERE'S NO BETTER FEELING
ON EARTH. YOU CAN'T BUY THIS.
