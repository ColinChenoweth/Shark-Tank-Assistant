I'M DOUG CLARK.
AND I'M CHAD CLARK.
WE'RE BROTHERS.
WE'RE PARTNERS.
AND, APPARENTLY,
WE DRESS THE SAME.
SHARKS,
TODAY IS YOUR LUCKY DAY.
WE'RE WILLING TO BET
YOU HAVE PASSWORD PROBLEMS.
YOU TRY YOUR PASSWORD,
AND IT DOESN'T WORK.
THEN YOU TRY
ADDING YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER
TO THAT GO-TO PASSWORD,
AND IT DOESN'T WORK, EITHER.
YOU END UP HAVING TO
RESET YOUR PASSWORD.
YOU GO THROUGH ALL OF THE STEPS
TO RESET YOUR PASSWORD.
YOU'VE WASTED A TON OF TIME,
AND YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.
BUT NOT ANYMORE,
WITH SPLIKITY.
SPLIKITY IS SOFTWARE THAT RUNS
ACROSS ALL OF YOUR DEVICES.
IT SAVES YOUR PASSWORDS,
IT AUTOMATICALLY FILLS THEM
AS YOU BROWSE THE INTERNET,
AND IT AUTOMATICALLY SYNCS THEM
TO ALL OF YOUR DEVICES
SO YOU HAVE THEM
WHEREVER YOU ARE
AND WHEREVER
YOU NEED THEM MOST.
BUT NOT ONLY THAT,
SPLIKITY CREATES
STRONG, UNIQUE PASSWORDS
FOR ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS
TO HELP KEEP PEOPLE SAFE ONLINE.
WITH SPLIKITY,
EVERYTHING IS SIMPLE.
YOU'LL NEVER
HAVE TO REMEMBER
OR EVEN TYPE
ANOTHER PASSWORD AGAIN.
SO, SHARKS, WHO WANTS
TO ATTACK THE PASSWORD PROBLEM
WITH SPLIKITY?
YOU DIDN'T ASK
FOR ANY MONEY.
WE'RE GETTING
TO THAT.
WE'RE ASKING
FOR $200,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
OKAY.
Corcoran:
ARE YOU BOTH TECHIES?
YOU SURE DON'T LOOK THE PART
IN THAT SUIT.
WELL, LET US TELL YOU
ABOUT THE SUITS.
[ LAUGHS ] OKAY.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST INTERVIEW
OF OUR LIVES,
AND WE WANTED
TO LOOK SHARP.
OUR FRIENDS LIKE
TO MAKE FUN OF US A LITTLE BIT
BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO LIVE
AT HOME WITH OUR PARENTS.
YOU SEE, WE ARE PUTTING
EVERYTHING WE HAVE
INTO SPLIKITY.
WHO CAME UP WITH
THE DESIGN?
US AND OUR TEAM DESIGNED
THE SOFTWARE.
WHAT'S
YOUR SECURITY BACKGROUND?
UH, WE DO NOT HAVE
A TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND.
I'M OUT.
WOW, MARK.
THAT'S NEGATIVE.
SECURITY IS NOT
AN EASY SUBJECT, RIGHT?
YOU DON'T JUST FIGURE OUT
AND SAY,
"OKAY,
I'M GONNA LEARN SECURITY,
AND I'M GONNA TELL
MY PROGRAMMERS WHAT TO WRITE."
MARK, I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
SECURITY IS A HUGE SUBJECT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T LEARN IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE ARE HACKERS OUT THERE
LOOKING AT THAT,
GOING, "YEAH, BOY!"
I UNDERSTAND.
BUT WHAT THE HACKERS DON'T KNOW
IS WE ARE IMPLEMENTING
LEADING SECURITY MEASURES
TO KEEP PEOPLE'S SECURITY --
AND WHERE DO YOU GET
THOSE SECURITY MEASURES FROM?
WE HAVE GUYS
THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING IN
THIS INDUSTRY FOR A LONG TIME.
OUR LEAD DEVELOPER --
O'Leary:
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE GREAT
THINGS ABOUT "SHARK TANK"
IS THAT IN EVERY SECTOR,
THERE'S AN EXPERT.
NOW, IN THIS CASE,
MR. HERJAVEC MAKES A LIVING
SELLING SECURITY SYSTEMS
TO REALLY BIG COMPANIES.
AND I HAVE AN APP
CALLED CYBER DUST,
WHERE I'VE HAD TO PAY ATTENTION
TO SECURITY CONTINUOUSLY.
SO BE CAREFUL
WHEN YOU ANSWER THIS,
'CAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET FRIED.
GIVE THEM
A CHANCE!
Doug:
YOU KNOW, MARK,
I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU STARTED
WITH CYBER DUST,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A SECURITY BACKGROUND.
Herjavec: YEAH, BUT IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY, GUYS.
YOU'RE COMING
TO THE TAIL END OF AN INDUSTRY
THAT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR A LONG TIME.
HOW LONG
HAVE PASSWORDS BEEN AROUND?
LIKE, THIS ISN'T
A FLIGHTY SUBJECT.
I'M PREPARING THE BUTTER
TO SAUTé YOU IN IT.
OH, STOP IT! YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GUYS CAME IN HERE.
YOU CARED ENOUGH ABOUT IT
TO DRESS UP FOR THE MOMENT.
GARLIC OR NO GARLIC,
LORI?
LISTEN, EVERYBODY'S
BITING YOUR HEADS OFF.
TELL US HOW IT WORKS.
THE ENCRYPTED DATA,
WHICH IS USING AES256,
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS
OF PBKDF2 AND BCRYPT --
THAT'S TYPICAL.
EVERYBODY DOES THAT.
NOT EVERYBODY
DOES THAT, AND --
AES256 IS NOT UNUSUAL.
AES256 IS
A LEADING STANDARD.
BUT IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO YOU.
IT'S OPEN-SOURCE.
IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVE
TO YOU.
SO, KEEP GOING.
I DOWNLOAD THE APP. TELL ME --
SO YOU SAVE
YOUR PASSWORDS.
OKAY.
IT'S ENCRYPTED.
YOU LOG IN WITH OUR APP.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
I GO TO A WEBSITE.
EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATIC.
THE NEXT TIME
YOU GO TO A WEBSITE,
IT AUTOMATICALLY FILLS
YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD,
AUTOMATICALLY
LOGS YOU IN.
OKAY.
Greiner: LET ME COME FROM
THE FEMALE POINT OF VIEW, OKAY?
[ LAUGHS ]
THERE'S A FEMALE POINT OF VIEW
TO TECHNOLOGY?
YOU DON'T USE PASSWORDS?
THERE IS NO FEMALE POINT
OF VIEW.
NO, OF COURSE THERE IS!
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S A TECHNOLOGY
QUESTION.
NO! YOU GUYS!
FROM BEING IN TV SALES
FOR 18 YEARS,
I KNOW THAT WOMEN CONSUMERS
REACT DIFFERENTLY
TO CERTAIN THINGS
THAN MALE CONSUMERS DO.
SO IF YOU'RE NOT A TECHIE WOMAN,
THIS MIGHT BE APPEALING TO YOU.
MAYBE YOU GUYS THINK
IS SUBPAR OR NOTHING NEW,
BUT FOR A WOMAN,
IT WOULD BE EASY TO ACCESS.
LORI, THIS IS CRAZY.
SO I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT
WITHOUT THEM
GETTING SKEWERED.
I'M SO HAPPY WITH WHAT
LORI JUST SAID, BECAUSE SHE --
I BET YOU ARE,
'CAUSE WE'RE CRUSHING YOU,
AND SHE'S TRYING TO GIVE YOU
A LIFELINE.
YEAH, BUT --
DOUG, SECURITY IS
A NON-GENDER ISSUE.
SECURITY IS
FOR <i>EVERYBODY.</i>
NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT
THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE.
NO, HAVING AN APP
THAT'S USER-FRIENDLY
WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE?
...MAKES A WOMAN
FEEL COMFORTABLE.
LET US ADDRESS IT.
LET ME ADDRESS
WHAT LORI SAID.
HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE
FOR THE SERVICE?
NO, NO. LET HIM FINISH, THOUGH,
ROBERT, PLEASE.
LET HIM FINISH. BECAUSE, BARB,
AREN'T YOU INTERESTED?
I'M VERY INTERESTED,
AND I AGREE WITH HER
THAT WE HAVE
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON IT,
AND I'M ANXIOUS
TO HEAR YOUR ANSWER
IF THE GENTLEMEN WOULD NOT BE
SO RUDE.
AND WE'RE NOT
AS TECHNOLOGICAL.
Herjavec:
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE FOR IT?
IT'S $4.99 A MONTH
OR $49.99 A YEAR.
Corcoran: ONLY ABOUT A WEEK AGO,
I COULDN'T REMEMBER A PASSWORD.
IT WAS DRIVING ME NUTS,
ALL RIGHT?
TOOK ALL OF MY PASSWORDS
AND DUMPED IT INTO ONE APP,
AND ALL I NOW HAVE
IS <i>ONE</i> PASSWORD,
SO IT'S AN AGGREGATE
OF ALL OF MY PASSWORDS.
IS THIS
WHAT THIS SITE DOES?
AND IF SO, AREN'T THERE
A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE?
YES,
AND IT ALLOWS --
SO THERE'S
LOTS OF COMPETITION, RIGHT?
WE ARE THE FIRST SOLUTION
BUILT SPECIFICALLY
FOR THE EVERYDAY,
NONTECHNICAL USER.
Herjavec:
NO, NO. BUT HANG ON, NOW.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHO IT'S DESIGNED FOR.
GOT IT.
BUT TELL ME
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT IT.
JUST GIVE ME THAT SECRET SAUCE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.
FOR DOUG AND CHAD'S
ONLINE PASSWORD APP, SPLIKITY.
O'Leary: WE'RE AT THE HALFTIME
OF THE GAME.
HOW'S IT GOING?
[ Laughing ] OH, GOD!
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY --
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
WE --
WE ENJOY THE QUESTIONS.
WE DO ENJOY
THE QUESTIONS.
WE'VE HAD
A LOT OF TOUGH QUESTIONS
FROM A LOT OF THE COMPANIES
THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO.
WE TOLD YOU WE'VE DONE A DEAL
WITH ONE COMPANY.
WE'RE TALKING
TO SIX OTHER ONES.
Herjavec: CHAD, I WILL GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
YOU HAVE A CONSUMER BRAND,
AND I RESPECT THAT.
YOU'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER
THE CONSUMER BUSINESS.
I SEE A LOT OF CHALLENGES
FROM A MARKETING PERSPECTIVE.
I'M NOT YOUR INVESTOR.
I KNOW TOO MUCH.
I'M OUT.
TO YOUR POINT, I WISH
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED US
SOME OF WHAT WE'RE DOING
IN THE SECURITY AREA.
WE'RE USING AES256.
OKAY.
WE'RE USING TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ROUNDS OF PBKDF2.
OKAY.
WE'RE USING ALL
THE INDUSTRY-LEADING STANDARDS
FOR ENCRYPTION.
RIGHT, BUT THEY'RE --
BUT YOU JUST SAID
IT'S INDUSTRY-LEADING STANDARDS.
Corcoran:
THIS IS VERY CONFUSING TO ME.
YOU SEEM LIKE NICE GUYS.
BUT I CAN'T GET IT,
AND SO I'M GONNA GO OUT,
SIMPLY BECAUSE MY CHANCES
OF MAKING MONEY ON THIS
ARE NEXT TO ZERO
IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
Greiner:
THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM,
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE THAT CAN USE THIS.
MOST THINGS FOR ME, IF I CAN
UNDERSTAND THEM QUICKLY,
THEN THAT'S GREAT FOR ME
AS A CONSUMER.
BUT BECAUSE I <i>COULDN'T</i>
UNDERSTAND IT QUICKLY,
I'M SORRY TO SAY
I'M OUT.
IF YOU GUYS
COULD JUST GIVE US TWO MINUTES
TO EXPLAIN
WHAT WE WANTED TO EXPLAIN --
THERE'S ONLY ONE SHARK LEFT.
THAT'S ME.
I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION
OF YOU GUYS, OKAY?
I ASKED YOU AT HALFTIME
HOW YOU WERE DOING.
YOU HADN'T EVEN SCORED YET.
NO FIELD GOALS, NOTHING,
ALL RIGHT?
SO -- JUST -- LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I THINK.
THERE IS A DEMAND
FOR A PRODUCT LIKE THIS.
YEP. FOR SURE.
I AM A HUGE BRAND IN
THE FINANCIAL-SERVICES INDUSTRY.
I SELL O'SHARES,
MY ETF COMPANY.
I SELL O'LEARY FUNDS,
MY MUTUAL FUND COMPANY.
EVERY SINGLE SHARE
IN ALL THOSE FUNDS
IS HELD
ON AN ELECTRONIC BANK
WHERE CONSUMERS GO AND LOOK
AT THEIR ACCOUNTS EVERY DAY
USING PASSWORDS --
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM.
THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.
I AGREE THERE'S A PROBLEM.
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO TURN THIS INTO A BRAND,
HERE'S A DEAL
I'LL OFFER YOU, OKAY?
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE
IS GONNA THROW YOU A LIFELINE.
THE ONLY WAY
I'LL DO THIS IS
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
AS VENTURE DEBT.
ALL RIGHT?
I LOAN IT TO YOUR COMPANY,
'CAUSE YOU NEED IT
TO ACTUALLY START BUILDING
THIS CONSUMER BRAND.
YOU PAY ME 10% OF SALES
UNTIL YOU PAY ME BACK $600,000.
TO KEEP ME INTERESTED
IN CARING ABOUT YOU
AND ENDORSING YOUR BRAND,
I WANT 5% OF THE COMPANY
JUST BECAUSE I'M MR. WONDERFUL.
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.
I THINK YOU SHOULD, 'CAUSE
YOU DIDN'T GET ANYTHING ELSE.
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO PARTNER WITH HIM
AFTER WHAT YOU
JUST SAT THERE --
BECAUSE I CAN ACTUALLY
MAKE THIS WORK FOR YOU.
WE WANT IT TO BE
A CONSUMER BRAND
THAT WENT
DIRECT TO CONSUMER.
DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
TURN THIS INTO A BRAND OR NOT?
I KNOW MY VALUE. I'M VERY
CONFIDENT IN MY ABILITIES.
I'VE DONE IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
I'M REALLY GOOD.
BUT I STILL SEE
THE MERIT FOR THE SERVICE.
DO YOU WANT TO DO
MY DEAL OR NOT? YES OR NO?
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR OFFER.
WE'RE GONNA BE PROFITABLE
NEXT MONTH.
WE'RE GOING HOME
TO SIGN ANOTHER DEAL,
AND WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS
WITH FIVE OTHER COMPANIES.
THIS IS ALL
SINCE LAST MONTH.
IS THAT A YES OR A NO?
[ HERJAVEC LAUGHS ]
Herjavec: DOUG, IT'S NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY TO LISTEN.
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE ME HEAR.
GUYS, IT'S OVER.
THANKS A LOT
FOR YOUR TIME.
Herjavec:
CHAD AND DOUG, GOOD LUCK.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK.
