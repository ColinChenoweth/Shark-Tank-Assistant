BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE FLAVORS ARE BEYOND EXPIRED.
SAY HELLO TO O'DANG HUMMUS.
WE MAKE THE MOST DELICIOUS,
BEST-DANG HUMMUS YOU'VE EVER HAD
AND ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO DO ANY
OF THOSE TRADITIONAL FLAVORS.
INSTEAD, WE PUT THE "FUN"
IN "DYSFUNCTIONAL"
WITH WILD AND CRAZY FLAVORS
THAT TAKE YOUR TASTE BUDS
ON A JOYRIDE TO FLAVOR TOWN.
[ LAUGHS ]
O'DANG IS ONLY 30 CALORIES
ON AVERAGE PER SERVING.
THAT'S APPROXIMATELY
1/3 THE CALORIES
OF SOME STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS,
WHICH MEANS
YOU CAN EAT THREE TIMES AS MUCH.
BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
[ LAUGHS ]
SO CHOMP, CHOMP.
WHO WANTS A SNACK?
BRING IT ON.
WE DO.
LET'S DO IT, GUYS.
YEAH, LET'S TRY IT.
ONE FOR YOU, SIR.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
AW, THANK YOU.
HE'S SUCH A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS.
OH, HE IS
A TRUE GENTLEMAN.
FOR YOU,
MR. WONDERFUL.
ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU.
I'LL DO THE SAME FOR BARB,
BECAUSE I <i>AM</i> MR. WONDERFUL.
WHY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[ LAUGHS ]
ONE FOR YOU, MR. CUBAN.
THANK YOU, SIR.
WHEN "BEYOND THE TANK"
CHECKED IN ON US,
WE WENT TO SEE MARK
IN DALLAS.
I'M TERRIFIED OF PUTTING IN
ANY TYPE OF NEW WEBSITE.
YOU'RE WALKING
OUT OF ONE FIRE
INTO ANOTHER ONE THAT COULD
BURN YOUR BUSINESS UP.
IT'S A RISK.
IT'S NOT A <i>SMART</i> RISK.
Diana: HE THOUGHT SPENDING
A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS
ON A NEW WEBSITE
COULD RISK LOSING EVERYTHING.
THE MORE WE THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT MARK SAID,
THE MORE WE REALIZED
HE WAS RIGHT,
SO WE DECIDED
TO TAKE HIS ADVICE AFTER ALL.
Hey, guys.
How's it going?
HI, MARK.
The true test
of great entrepreneurs
is how you respond
to adversity.
You guys decided
to come along
and let us
take over the website,
and -- Boom! --
great things have happened.
The gang
is back together.
WE'RE BACK.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S GET THIS OUT.
WE GOT 1,000 MORE
COMING IN.
Josh: OUR SALES AND PROFITS
CONTINUE TO RISE.
IN 2014, WE FINISHED THE YEAR
OVER $14 MILLION IN SALES.
Diana:
WITH THE MONEY WE'VE SAVED
BY NOT GETTING A NEW WEBSITE,
WE'RE DESIGNING OUR FIRST
IN-HOUSE CLOTHING LINE,
WE'RE EXPANDING INTO HOME DECOR,
AND WITH MARK'S HELP,
WE'LL BE LAUNCHING
OUR FIRST RED DRESS APP.
WE ARE SO GRATEFUL
FOR THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD
BECAUSE OF "SHARK TANK."
THANKS TO MARK,
THINGS HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN
WE COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED.
All:
THANK YOU, "SHARK TANK"!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
MY NAME IS MIKKI BEY, I LIVE
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,
AND I'M THE C.E.O.
AT MIKKI BEY EYELASH EXTENSIONS.
COME ON IN, MILAN.
I GOT MY START
AS A CELEBRITY MAKEUP ARTIST
TO STARS LIKE
MISSY ELLIOTT, JASON DERULO,
AND COLBIE CAILLAT.
LET'S GET STARTED.
MY SALON IS PINK.
IT'S GIRLY.
PEOPLE CALL IT
THE BARBIE DREAM HOUSE.
WE'RE A FUN PLACE TO BE.
IT'S A VERY GIRL-FRIENDLY
EXPERIENCE.
MAKE SURE
YOU KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED.
EYELASH EXTENSIONS
ARE BECOMING MORE POPULAR,
AND WOMEN ARE STARTING
TO ASK QUESTIONS LIKE,
"WHY DO YOU EYES LOOK SO GOOD?"
I'VE DEVELOPED
A PROPRIETARY SYSTEM TO APPLY
THE HIGHEST-QUALITY LASHES
IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF TIME.
I'M THE FIRST TO DO IT,
AND I'M THE BEST.
HOW ARE THINGS GOING
AT THE SALON TODAY?
I'VE PUT EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE
INTO THIS BUSINESS.
IT'S MY BEST FRIEND.
IT'S MY HUSBAND. IT'S MY KIDS.
IT'S MY WHOLE LIFE.
I'M READY TO BUILD
A MIKKI BEY BRAND.
I REALLY SEE US
IN ALL THE LUXURY DESTINATIONS
OF THE WORLD.
AND I KNOW,
WITH A SHARK AS A PARTNER,
WE COULD DO IT
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.
HELLO, SHARKS.
I'M MIKKI BEY.
I'M THE C.E.O.
AND MASTER LASH ARTIST
OF MIKKI BEY EYELASH EXTENSIONS,
LOCATED IN
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.
I'M SEEKING $300,000
FOR 20% OF MY BUSINESS.
KIM KARDASHIAN WEST,
BEYONCé, AND J.LO --
YOU KNOW IT'S ALL FAKE, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHS ]
COME ON, GUYS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THEIR EYELASHES.
BUT WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM ME,
YOU, TOO, CAN GET
THAT GLAMOROUS CELEBRITY LOOK.
WELCOME TO
MIKKI BEY EYELASH EXTENSIONS.
IF YOU HAVE EYELASHES,
EYELASH EXTENSIONS ARE FOR YOU.
EVEN <i>MEN</i> ARE
JUMPING IN ON THE BANDWAGON.
CAN'T YOU IMAGINE MR. WONDERFUL
IN MIKKI BEY EYELASH EXTENSIONS?
YEAH!
I CAN'T.
BRING IT, BABY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHOA!
WITH YOUR CONNECTIONS,
WE'LL BE LAUGHING
ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK.
HOOK ME UP.
YOUR NEXT BEST INVESTMENT
IS ONE WINK AWAY.
YOU READY?
LET'S DO IT.
HOW DO YOU WANT ME?
JUST GO AHEAD
AND LAY DOWN.
[ Laughing ]
"HOW DO YOU WANT ME?"
Herjavec: PLEASE KEEP
YOUR CLOTHES ON, MARK.
OKAY, GO AHEAD
AND CLOSE FOR ME.
OKAY.
SO, I'M JUST TAKING
A LITTLE DAB
OF MEDICAL ADHESIVE GLUE.
I'M GOING TO SEPARATE
ONE OF HIS LASHES
SO THAT IT'S ISOLATED
BY ITSELF.
WOW.
AND THEN
I'LL JUST ATTACH THE LASH.
DID YOU JUST PUT IT ON?
YES.
SO, THIS IS YOUR LASH.
THIS IS THE EYELASH EXTENSION.
IT'S FLUSH TO YOUR LASH
AND NOT YOUR SKIN.
HOW MANY LASHES
DID YOU PUT ON HIS EYE?
I JUST PUT ON ONE
BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE IT OFF OF HIM.
THAT'S ALL?
HOW CAN WE TELL HOW GOOD IT IS?
WELL, WE HAVE MODELS.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
BEFORE-AND-AFTERS.
Herjavec: OH, I CAN SEE.
Greiner:
OKAY, YEAH. LET'S SEE THAT.
Bey: THE BEST THING
ABOUT EYELASH EXTENSIONS
IS THAT IT CUTS
YOUR MAKEUP TIME IN HALF, SO --
OKAY, MIKKI,
THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE
ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE.
WELL, IS THERE?
YOU'RE GOOD AT IT.
THERE IS.
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT IT?
I HAVE A TECHNIQUE
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PATENT,
AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO CUT THE
APPLICATION TIME DOWN IN HALF.
AND WHY CAN YOU DO IT
IN HALF THE TIME?
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT,
BECAUSE --
THAT'S HER PATENT.
EXACTLY.
O'Leary: WAIT A SECOND.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR AN INVESTOR.
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT THIS IS WORTH $1.5 MILLION.
YES, SIR.
WHAT DO YOU DO
THAT'S WORTH $1.5 MILLION?
LET'S GET SERIOUS HERE,
'CAUSE I'M REALLY THINKING,
WHAT?
WELL, MY REVENUE IN 2012
WAS $69,000.
MY REVENUE IN 2013
WAS $95,000.
NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT BUSINESS,
BUT WHY IS IT WORTH
$1.5 MILLION?
SURE.
I'M GONNA GET TO IT.
WHILE
WE'RE STILL ALIVE HERE.
YEAH, I'M GONNA TAKE MY TIME.
THIS IS MY MOMENT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GO, GIRL.
ALL RIGHT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
UM...
IN 2014,
WE MADE $130,000,
AND YEAR-TO-DATE RIGHT NOW,
WE ARE AT ABOUT $60,000.
AND I HAVE JUST ADDED
FULL STAFF.
I HAVE FOUR OTHER
PART-TIME LASH ARTISTS.
BUT, MIKKI,
WHAT AM I BUYING?
AM I BUYING A SERVICE,
OR AM I BUYING
A PROPRIETARY PRODUCT?
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE
MONEY FOR DEFINITELY IS PRODUCT,
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I HAVE TO HAVE
IS MY OWN MIKKI BEY
EYELASH EXTENSIONS BRAND,
BECAUSE I PLAN
TO LICENSE THIS.
I HAVE A WAY
THAT I ASSEMBLE THE LASHES
SO THAT IT'S MUCH EASIER
AS FAR AS THE SIZE
TO GET IT ON THE LASHES
FASTER.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD, BUT WHY CAN'T
ANYBODY ELSE DO THAT, MIKKI?
THEY COULD.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE TRYING TO REPLICATE
SOMETHING I CREATED.
OKAY, THEY COULD.
I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE
AHEAD OF THE TREND.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH YOUR BUSINESS -- NOTHING.
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING
VERY, VERY WELL,
AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT.
BUT THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE
OR PROPRIETARY ABOUT IT AT ALL.
THERE'S NOWHERE FOR AN INVESTOR
TO FIT INTO THIS STORY.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH MY $300,000?
WHAT'S THE PLAN?
I'M GOING TO BUY MY PRODUCT,
I'M GOING TO GET MY PATENT,
I'M GOING TO BUILD A TEAM TO
HELP ME GO OUT TO THESE PLACES
AND TRAIN THEM ON-SITE
WITH THEIR AESTHETICIANS
THAT THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING
ON THEIR PAYROLL.
HOW BIG
IS YOUR TEAM NOW?
WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE
WORKING FOR US.
DO YOU HAVE A RETAIL STOREFRONT
RIGHT NOW?
YES, I DO.
A RETAIL STORE?
IT'S ON ONE OF THE BUSIEST
STREETS IN LOS ANGELES, YES.
MIKKI,
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE?
I AM -- I CHARGE $200
FOR THE INITIAL FULL SET.
AND WHAT'S THE SALES
IN THAT RETAIL STORE?
THE YEAR-TO-DATE RIGHT NOW
IS ALMOST $60,000.
THOSE NUMBERS DON'T SUPPORT
A $1.5 MILLION VALUE.
I HAVEN'T HEARD --
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD
BUT HANG ON -- LOOK --
FOR AN INVESTOR
TO GET THEIR HEAD AROUND
JUST INVESTING
IN A PERSON
WHO'S TELLING YOU
THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I'VE LISTENED
TO WHAT YOU'VE HAD TO SAY.
BUT YOU <i>HAVEN'T,</i>
BECAUSE I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I AM AN EXPERT
IN THIS AREA.
I GOT IT.
IT IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU CAN JUST THROW MONEY AT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR BUSINESS?
YOU'RE DOING OKAY.
YEAH, THAT'S THE POINT.
IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S NOT INVESTABLE.
IT'S JUST NOT INVESTABLE.
IT'S <i>VERY</i> INVESTABLE.
OKAY?
HOW?
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE SOMEONE
WHO HAS THE VISION TO SEE.
HERE'S MY PREDICTION
FOR YOU, MIKKI --
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET A DEAL
TODAY ON "SHARK TANK."
OKAY.
AND I'M THE FIRST TO TELL YOU
THAT, AND I'M ALWAYS RIGHT.
I'M OUT.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
BECAUSE...
[ Voice breaking ] I HAVE
GIVEN UP EVERYTHING FOR THIS.
AND EYELASH EXTENSIONS
MAY NOT SOUND IMPORTANT TO YOU,
BUT I HAVE PEOPLE
WHO COME AND SEE ME,
AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
TO THEM.
IT GIVES THEM
MORE CONFIDENCE.
THEY FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THEMSELVES.
I DON'T NEED SOMEONE
TO HOLD MY HAND.
I CAN DO THIS.
I HAVE DONE THIS BY MYSELF.
I'M NOT STOPPING.
I'M NOT STOPPING.
THIS IS MY PASSION.
THIS IS MY DESTINY.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT
TO INVEST IN A PERSON,
BUT I'M ASKING YOU
TO TAKE THE CHANCE ON ME.
TAKE THE CHANCE ON ME,
BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU,
IF I HAVE TO WORK MY FINGERS
TO THE BONE
TO GET YOU YOUR MONEY BACK,
I WILL GET YOU
EVERY PENNY OF YOUR MONEY BACK.
MARK, I AM
A SUPER FAN OF YOU,
AND I ALWAYS SAID
IF I CAN'T <i>GET</i> MARK CUBAN,
I HAVE TO <i>BE</i> MARK CUBAN.
BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME THING
THAT'S IN ALL OF YOU IN ME.
AND YOU SHOULD RECOGNIZE ME,
'CAUSE I'M YOUR PEOPLE.
WE'RE THE SAME.
I JUST NEED A CHANCE.
MIKKI,
I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I STARTED
MY BROKERAGE BUSINESS,
I THOUGHT
I WAS A BUSINESS.
I RENTED APARTMENTS
AND MADE A COMMISSION CHECK
UNTIL ONE DAY, I REALIZED
I DIDN'T HAVE A BUSINESS.
I HAD A SERVICE.
AND I ACTUALLY SEE YOU
AT THAT POINT HERE.
YOU SHOULD BE THINKING, "HOW
DOES THIS THING GET BUILT BIG
WITHOUT ME,
WITH ME MOTIVATING PEOPLE?"
'CAUSE IT WASN'T UNTIL I DID
THAT AND STEPPED OUT OF SALES
THAT I STARTED BUILDING
A BUSINESS.
I'M OUT, 'CAUSE I SEE IT
AS A SERVICE, NOT A BUSINESS.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: MIKKI.
RIGHT NOW I AGREE WITH BARB.
IT'S A SERVICE.
I DON'T SEE WHAT THERE IS
FOR ME TO INVEST IN.
BUT YOU HAVE A FIRE IN YOU
AND A DRIVE IN YOU
THAT WILL GET YOU
EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.
SO I'M OUT,
BUT I THINK THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
THANK YOU.
Cuban: YOU SAY
YOU HAVE SIX PROFESSIONAL...
TECHNICIANS.
...TECHNICIANS
THAT WORK FOR YOU.
RIGHT.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU POCKETING
PER WEEK?
IT'S ABOUT...
$2,000.
SO IF YOU GO FROM 6 TO 12,
YOU'RE MAKING $4,000 A WEEK.
YOU GO FROM 12 TO 24,
YOU'RE PROBABLY MAKING $8,000.
AND IF SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE
ARE TRAINING OTHER PEOPLE,
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THERE'S
200 MIKKI BEY TECHNICIANS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
AND YOU'RE DOMINATING
A SPACE.
OKAY.
YOU DON'T NEED ME,
SO I'M OUT,
BUT I JUST THINK
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.
YOU JUST GOT TO GRAB IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
UH, MIKKI, YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BE A MARK CUBAN.
YOU CAN BE MIKKI BEY.
[ LAUGHS ]
AS MARK SAID,
YOU'RE MAKING GOOD MONEY
DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TODAY,
BUT IT'S JUST NOT SCALABLE
AS AN INVESTMENT.
I'M OUT. THANK YOU.
I LOVE THE EMOTION,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE UP
THIS CRYING STUFF.
OKAY.
THE MINUTE A WOMAN CRIES,
YOU'RE GIVING AWAY YOUR POWER.
YOU HAVE TO CRY
PRIVATELY.
WELL, I THINK
IT TAKES A LOT OF STRENGTH
TO SHOW
THIS TYPE OF VULNERABILITY.
NO, NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN.
NOT IN BUSINESS.
I'M SORRY -- NOT IN BUSINESS.
I HAVE HIRED MEN, WOMEN
MY WHOLE LIFE.
WHEN I GET A WOMAN
WHO'S CRYING,
I RE-FILE HER IN MY HEAD
IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL,
BECAUSE
I DON'T TRUST HER
IN TERMS OF
KEEPING A CAP ON HER EMOTION.
I THINK
IT DEPENDS ON THE PERSON.
IT'S WHAT YOU FELT
IN THE MOMENT, AND IT'S OKAY.
YOU HAVE TO BE
WHO YOU ARE.
NO.
I SAY
SAY GOODBYE TO THE CRYING.
ANYWAYS, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, MIKKI.
THANK YOU.
COME ON, GIRLS.
LET'S GO.
AH!
THERE SHE GOES.
I DON'T AGREE WITH BARBARA'S
POINT OF VIEW ABOUT CRYING,
BECAUSE IT'S INDICATIVE
OF WHO I AM.
I AM VERY PASSIONATE.
I'M AN ALL-OR-NOTHING
TYPE OF PERSON,
SO I LEFT IT ALL OUT THERE.
PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE. YOU CAN'T
MAKE BLANKET STATEMENTS.
YEAH.
YES, YOU CAN.
