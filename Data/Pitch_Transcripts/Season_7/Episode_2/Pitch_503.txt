OUR PROPRIETARY BANNER
THAT INTERACTS WITH THE USER
AS THEY BROWSE
THE INTERNET.
BUT YEAH,
THAT'S NOT NEW, RIGHT?
BUT YOU'RE JUST SAYING
IT'S SIMPLER.
YES. AND IT --
TELL ME
WHAT YOUR SALES ARE.
OKAY.
OUR SALES ARE $55,000 SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF LAST MONTH.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
THAT'S GOOD.
SO YOU'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
A MONTH?
WHEN WE WERE
FINISHING DEVELOPMENT
AT THE END OF LAST YEAR,
WE WERE APPROACHED
BY A LARGE SECURITY COMPANY,
WENT THROUGH
ALL OF OUR SOFTWARE,
MADE SURE THAT IT WAS
UP TO THEIR STANDARDS,
AND THEY WANTED
TO LICENSE IT FROM US.
SO THE $55,000
IS A ROYALTY FROM THEM.
YES.
WHICH ONE?
I CAN'T SHARE
THAT INFORMATION.
WE'RE UNDER
NONDISCLOSURE.
HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY YOU
PER USER?
WE CAN'T SAY EXACTLY
HOW MUCH THEY PAY US PER USER.
THAT'S PART OF
THEIR NONDISCLOSURE.
YOU WANT AN INVESTMENT.
GUYS, LET ME GIVE YOU THE ANSWER
THAT YOU'RE GIVING US.
I'M GONNA TURN IT AROUND
FOR A SECOND
SO YOU CAN SEE
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FROM HERE.
I'M GONNA SELL YOU A PRODUCT.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT.
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHY YOU'RE GONNA THINK
THIS IS
THE BEST PRODUCT EVER --
BECAUSE I LICENSED IT
TO A COMPANY
I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT,
BUT THEY'RE A GREAT COMPANY.
I CAN'T TELL YOU THEIR NAME,
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY DO,
BUT THEY'RE A GREAT COMPANY
IN THIS SPACE,
SO YOU SHOULD BELIEVE ME
AND GIVE ME HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.
YOU READY
TO WRITE ME A CHECK?
O'Leary: WE'RE AT THE HALFTIME
OF THE GAME.
HOW'S IT GOING?
HI. I'M CHELSEA.
AND I'M LEIGH ANN.
WE'RE FROM NEW YORK CITY,
AND WE'RE SEEKING $150,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY,
LOLIWARE.
LOLIWARE IS
A NEW CATEGORY
OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
THAT YOU CAN EAT.
THAT'S RIGHT --
I JUST ATE MY CUP.
THAT'S FUNNY.
WE CALL THIS NEW CATEGORY
BIODEGREDIBLE.
IT'S BOTH BIODEGRADABLE
AND EDIBLE.
IT'S A NEW AND EXCITING
EATING AND DRINKING EXPERIENCE
THAT OFFERS
FUN FLAVOR COMBINATIONS
FOR BOTH BEVERAGES
AND DESSERTS.
IMAGINE DRINKING
YOUR COLD-BREW COFFEE
IN OUR MADAGASCAR
VANILLA CUP
OR EVEN A MARGARITA
IN A CITRUS CUP.
LOLIWARE IS
A DELICIOUS ALTERNATIVE
TO DISPOSABLE CUPS
DESTINED FOR THE LANDFILL.
OUR CUPS GO FROM CUP TO SOIL
IN 60 DAYS.
THEY'RE 100% VEGAN,
GLUTEN-FREE,
AND MADE
WITH ORGANIC INGREDIENTS.
BUT THE CUP
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
WITH LOLIWARE, WE'RE CREATING
A PLASTIC-FREE REVOLUTION
AND GIVING PEOPLE
A REASON
TO GET EXCITED
ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY.
SHARKS, WE INVITE YOU
TO EAT YOUR CUP
AND TO CREATE A BIODEGREDIBLE
WORLD WITH LOLIWARE.
NOW, WHO'S READY TO TRY
THE CUP OF THE FUTURE?
Herjavec:
GOT TO TRY IT.
OKAY.
LORI, WHAT FLAVOR
DO YOU WANT?
OH, WOW.
ROBERT, WE MADE YOU
A SPECIAL MATCHA GREEN TEA FLOAT
WITH CHAMPAGNE
AND GOJI BERRY GARNISH.
THANK YOU.
LORI, WE MADE YOU
A BEAUTIFUL LAVENDER HONEY.
MR. WONDERFUL,
WE MADE YOU
A BEAUTIFUL
TART CHERRY CUP.
IT UPSETS ME EVERY TIME
YOU SAY "MR. WONDERFUL."
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?
IT UPSETS ME.
YES.
THANK YOU.
I SHOULD
PROBABLY EAT BARBARA'S,
'CAUSE I EAT HER ALIVE
EVERY DAY.
BARBARA, WE HAD TO MAKE YOU
A MADAGASCAR VANILLA CUP
TO PUT AN EDIBLE GOLD RIM
ON IT.
OH, THAT'S GOOD,
WHATEVER'S IN HERE.
Greiner:
YOUR CUP IS DELICIOUS.
WE'RE GLAD YOU LIKE IT.
THIS CUP
IS REALLY DELICIOUS.
I MEAN, I COULD SEE SOMEBODY
EATING YOUR CUP AS A DESSERT.
WHAT IS IT MADE OF?
IT'S A VEGETABLE GELATIN,
SO IT'S AN ALL-VEGAN VERSION
OF GELATIN.
YEAH.
IT'S 100% GLUTEN-FREE.
IT TASTES A LITTLE BIT
LIKE LICORICE, LIKE A --
YAHOO! FOOD
WROTE ABOUT US,
AND THEY THOUGHT THE CUP
WAS LIKE AN ADULT FRUIT ROLL-UP.
ALL OF OUR FLAVORS AND COLORS
COME FROM FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.
WHO IS YOUR CONSUMER
SO FAR?
SO, WE LAUNCHED SALES
THREE MONTHS AGO,
AND WE HAVE $110,000
IN SALES,
AND WE'RE PARTNERING
WITH A $30 MILLION
EVENT-PLANNING COMPANY
IN NEW YORK CITY
CALLED SAVE THE DATE,
WHO HAS JUST SIGNED
A $1.3 MILLION
LETTER OF INTENT
TO SELL LOLIWARE TO ALL OF
THEIR EVENTS IN NEW YORK CITY.
WE ALSO ARE SIGNED
WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST
FOOD-DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES.
Corcoran:
THEY JUST CALLED YOU UP
AND SAID, "WE LOVE YOU.
WE HEARD ABOUT YOU.
WE'RE COMING"?
THEY SAW US
AT A TRADE SHOW.
WE WERE AT CATERSOURCE
IN LAS VEGAS.
I SEE.
IN ONE DAY,
WE SOLD 3,500 CUPS.
WOW.
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
YEAH,
SO, LEIGH ANN AND I MET
AT ONE OF THE TOP DESIGN SCHOOLS
IN NEW YORK CITY,
CALLED PARSONS SCHOOL
OF DESIGN.
MM-HMM.
AND WE GRADUATED
AT THE TOP OF OUR CLASS.
SO, ACTUALLY, THIS PRODUCT
STARTED AS A COMPETITION.
WE THOUGHT,
"WOULDN'T IT BE COOL
IF WE THOUGHT OF JELLO
AS A MATERIAL
THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY CREATE
SOMETHING STRUCTURAL FROM?"
WE THOUGHT, "I WONDER
IF WE COULD REPLACE PLASTIC CUPS
BY MAKING EDIBLE CUPS."
WE WENT TO THE COMPETITION.
EVERYONE LOVED IT.
THEY HAD TO CREATE
A NEW CATEGORY FOR US.
AND SOMETHING INCREDIBLE
HAPPENED.
LOLIWARE EXPLODED
ON THE INTERNET,
AND IT WENT VIRAL.
THE NEXT WEEK,
I GOT AN ORDER FOR 60,000 CUPS
FROM PERNOD RICARD.
60,000 CUPS?
60,000.
Herjavec: AND, CHELSEA,
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR,
AND WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
SO, IT COSTS US 97 CENTS
TO MAKE EACH CUP RIGHT NOW,
AND WE'RE SELLING IT TO
FOOD SERVICE FOR $1.50 PER CUP,
AND WE'RE LOOKING
TO TAKE THOSE COSTS DOWN
DRAMATICALLY
OVER THE NEXT YEAR.
WE ANTICIPATE
THAT IT'LL GO DOWN TO 50 CENTS.
YOU MUST HAVE
RAISED MONEY,
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PAY
FOR INVENTORY,
YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT
THE MACHINE.
YEAH, AFTER WE REALIZED THIS IS
SOMETHING WE WANT TO TAKE
FROM PROTOTYPE TO BUSINESS,
WE PUT IN OUR OWN MONEY --
ABOUT $10,000 --
THEN WE DID
A FRIENDS AND FAMILY $100,000,
AND CURRENTLY,
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A $1 MILLION RAISE.
WE'RE 30% THROUGH.
WE HAVE ANOTHER $100,000
COMMITTED.
CHELSEA, LOOK,
I-I LOVE IT.
I THINK
YOU NEED MORE MONEY.
I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN
PUTTING UP THE $150,000 FOR 10%.
YOU HAVE AN OUTSTANDING AMOUNT
OF $600,000.
UM...
I WANT TO PARTICIPATE.
I MEAN, I'D BE INTERESTED
FOR GETTING MORE EQUITY.
SURE. WHAT'S --
IF WE PUT UP
THE ENTIRE $600,000.
YEAH.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT UP
ON MY OWN.
I MEAN, I'M HAPPY TO GO IN
WITH ANYBODY ELSE.
WE WOULD LOVE TO CLOSE OUT
THE ROUND WITH THE SHARKS.
HOW MUCH IS LEFT
IN THE ROUND?
$600,000.
WE COULD DO 25%.
CHELSEA, LOOK, I --
Cuban: DONE.
DONE.
YEAH, MARK,
CAN I GET IN ON THAT?
WHO'S COMING IN?
I'M IN.
I WANT A PIECE OF THAT.
CAN WE HEAR OTHER DEALS?
BARBARA?
LET <i>ME</i> DECIDE
WHO GETS IN.
WAIT.
NO!
CHELSEA,
IT WAS MY IDEA.
LEIGH ANN AND CHELSEA
HAVE REVISED THEIR OFFER
FOR THEIR EDIBLE-CUP COMPANY,
LOLIWARE.
WE WOULD LOVE TO CLOSE OUT
THE ROUND WITH THE SHARKS.
HOW MUCH IS LEFT
IN THE ROUND?
Tucker: $600,000.
WE COULD DO 25%.
DONE. DONE.
YEAH, MARK,
CAN I GET IN ON THAT?
WHO'S COMING IN?
I'M IN.
I WANT A PIECE OF THAT.
CAN WE HEAR OTHER DEALS?
BARBARA?
LET <i>ME</i> DECIDE
WHO GETS IN.
WAIT.
NO!
CHELSEA, IT WAS MY IDEA.
YEAH, IT WAS YOUR IDEA. SO, WHAT
DO WE HAVE ON THE TABLE?
WE WANT TO HEAR.
I'LL GO IN --
I'LL TAKE $200,000 OF IT.
I DID A GREAT INVESTMENT
WITH MARK FOR LOLLACUP.
I DON'T THINK WE NEED
MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE.
NO, WE'RE FINE.
STRAIGHT-UP EQUITY.
NO, NO. BEFORE YOU GO THERE,
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
ARE YOU IN?
WELL, WE'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT BARBARA HAS TO SAY.
NO, I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING.
I PREFER MARK AS A PARTNER
BECAUSE HE HAS GOT
THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY THAN
ALL THE OTHER LITTLE MEN HERE.
I'VE DONE VERY WELL
WITH MARK,
EVEN THOUGH
WE SOMETIMES FIGHT ON HERE.
YES.
WE HAVE
A REAL OFFER --
$600,000 FOR 25%.
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
Corcoran:
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,
I'D BE HAPPY
TO TAKE MY MOST FAVORITE PARTNER
IN ON THE DEAL
OR EVEN LORI, OKAY?
BUT YOU'D BE
OUT OF YOUR MIND
TO DO A DEAL
WITHOUT ME INVOLVED.
YOU'D REALLY BE CRAZY.
WHY IS THAT?
I AM THE BEST PARTNER
YOU WILL EVER MEET,
AND IF YOU WERE
TO WALK OUT IN THAT HALL
AND CALL ANY OF
MY ENTREPRENEUR PARTNERS --
KEEP ME IN THE DEAL,
AND <i>YOU</i> PICK THE OTHER PARTNERS.
YOU KNOW, WE ALL HAVE
GREAT ENTREPRENEURS.
YOU MUST KNOW THAT
BY NOW.
MR. WONDERFUL, WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING? ARE YOU IN?
YOU KNOW, I'M WILLING TO PARTNER
WITH OTHER SHARKS,
BUT I'VE GOT TO HAVE
ENOUGH TO CARE.
OKAY.
SO I NEED
$200,000 OF THE DEAL.
I'LL GO IN WITH MARK
FOR $600,000 FOR 25%.
WE'RE SHARING THE DEAL.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT, BUT LOOK,
IF YOU WANT TWO SHARKS,
I'LL GO IN WITH ROBERT,
I'LL DO THE $300,000,
WE'LL TAKE THE WHOLE 25%.
OKAY.
Greiner: I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M THINKING.
OKAY.
I LOVE YOUR MISSION ABOUT CARING
ABOUT WASTE AND LANDFILLS,
BUT I THINK
IT'S REALLY A PARTY THING.
COME IN WITH US, AND WE'LL GET
THREE SHARKS FOR $600K.
THEN IT'S THREE VERSUS TWO.
I LIKE IT.
NO,
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT.
AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU...
I'M GONNA GO OUT.
Both:
WE RESPECT YOUR DECISION.
MARK, ARE YOU THROWING ME
TO THE CURB WITH BARBARA?
HONESTLY,
I CAN WORK WITH EITHER/OR.
I KNOW
IT'S THE SHARK TANK,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA THROW MARK
TO THE CURB.
THE ORIGINAL DEAL WAS MARK AND I
FOR $600,000 FOR 25%.
THAT'S THE OFFER
WE MADE YOU.
OKAY.
I DON'T WANT TO GO IN
WITH KEVIN OR BARBARA.
THAT WAS
THE ORIGINAL OFFER.
OKAY.
O'Leary:
SO, LADIES, AFTER ALL THAT,
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
YOU'VE GOT MARK AND BARBARA --
$600,000 FOR 25% --
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
Briganti:
THIS IS A REALLY SURREAL MOMENT
FOR LEIGH ANN AND I.
WE WENT IN
ASKING FOR $150,000 FOR 10%,
AND WE WERE EXPECTING TO HAVE TO
OFFER A LOT MORE EQUITY
FOR THAT AMOUNT,
'CAUSE WE'RE A VERY NEW COMPANY.
AND THE FACT
THAT WE'RE WALKING OUT
WITH OUR WHOLE ROUND FINISHED
BY OUR TOP TWO SHARKS,
IT'S REALLY SURREAL.
WE COULDN'T BE
MORE EXCITED.
