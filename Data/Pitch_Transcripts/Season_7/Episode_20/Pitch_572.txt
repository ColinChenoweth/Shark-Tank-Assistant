My name is Katherine Krug,
and I'm the creator
of BetterBack.
Today I'm seeking
a $750,000 investment
for a 7.5% equity stake
in my company.
Wow.
So, sharks, check your posture
right now.
I'm especially looking
at you, Cuban.
Yeah, what can I say?
-[ Chuckles ]
It turns out that we sit for
over 9 hours every single day,
and because of the way
we're doing it,
hunched and rounded towards
our work and our technology,
it means 8 out of
every 10 people you know
will have back pain
in their lives.
My back pain started
over three years ago,
and I have spent so much time
and money
trying dozens of products
and therapies,
and I couldn't find anything
that just worked.
So I made BetterBack.
BetterBack allows you
to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture,
easing back pain and retraining
your body's default posture,
so when you stand or sit
without BetterBack,
your posture is greatly
improved.
It's lightweight and portable,
so you can throw it in your bag
and make every
single chair ergonomic.
BetterBack is just the start.
I'm on a mission to disrupt
the orthopedic aisle
and help people not just have
better backs,
but to live better.
So, sharks, who's got my back?
I want to try it on.
-Yes.
Great.
I've got samples for you guys.
Start with you guys here.
-This is Lori's?
-Yes. Thank you so much.
-And we do what he did?
O'Leary: How do --
Greiner: You put it over
your knees and then around --
and around your back?
That's exactly right.
I'll walk you guys through it.
So, you guys will start
by placing two feet
flat on the floor,
which is just great
ergonomics.
Next, you'll notice
the up arrow,
so that's the side
that goes up.
So, yeah, wrap the back pad
around your back...
Okay.
...and you'll wrap the kneepads
around your knees.
After you put it on
the first time,
it gets much easier and faster
to put it on.
The best thing to do is,
once the kneepads
are over your knee,
if it's loose enough,
you'll want to lean forward
and pull on the adjustable
straps while you sit up,
which should put you in
a really supportive position.
Katherine, it was
pretty intimidating,
putting it on or seeing it.
It seemed like it was
complicated -- what goes where?
Once it's on,
I have to tell you,
it's like
you can totally relax.
Katherine: Yay!
The ball of your back
is in perfect position.
I love it!
Who's this gentleman
sitting here?
He is my hunky model --
my fiancé!
-Ah.
-[ Chuckles ]
Congratulations.
-So, tell us how it started.
-Yeah.
So I was building
my last start up,
and I was working
the 14-hours-a day,
6-days-a-week grind,
and just the act of
rounding towards my laptop
for so many hours a day set off
terrible sciatica pain,
and I tried dozens
of products
and they all had some
really great components,
but nothing was
a full solution.
A buddy of mine was in
industrial design.
We came up with a prototype
that did help me sit
and relieve a lot of the pain
that I experienced.
So I launched my product
on Kickstarter in April.
I had a $12,500 funding goal.
I ended up selling 100 times
my funding goal.
I became the first solo woman
to break the million-dollar mark
on Kickstarter --
-Good for you.
-And I sold -- Thank you!
Whoo-hoo!
I sold $1.2 million worth
of BetterBacks
in just over a month.
-Wow.
-Wow.
Have you shipped
any of those?
Right now, I have 10,000 units
that have just left my factory,
another 10,000
that are leaving Monday,
and the remaining 10,000 units
are leaving at the end
of the month.
So your customer has not yet
tried the product.
Correct.
Katherine, why do you think
that many people bought it?
So in America alone,
this year,
50% of working Americans
will have back pain.
The numbers are staggering.
$50 billion is spent
on back pain every year,
just in the United States.
How much does it cost you
to make them?
My cost is $8.05 per unit.
And you were selling that --
And I was selling it for $49
on Kickstarter.
You've imputed a value
of $10 million on it.
Why?
So, $1.2 million in sales
in just over a month.
I have, from that,
$875,000 in the bank.
I think I can land $4.5 million
in online sales next year.
Let me stop you
with your online sales.
How will you generate
the traffic to --
It's one thing on Kickstarter,
something else when you're
another store living online,
trying to get the eyeballs in
to look at you.
Absolutely.
What's your plan for actually
making that happen?
Yeah, so, two different
divergent tracks.
One is to jump on Amazon US,
UK, Germany, and Canada.
So there you're getting
the natural eyeballs.
I have met an amazing --
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no. No.
I have a growth hacker
who has helped --
A what?
Basically an Amazon
growth hacker...
Right.
...who has learned
how you optimize page,
optimize pricing
in order to drive --
That's all fine and good,
and you can even get up
to search results if you get
people to search, right?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
But that doesn't
necessarily translate
into a-a projectable number
of sales.
I think you're asking way, way,
way too much for your valuation
based on the sales
only on Kickstarter.
So, for that reason,
I'm out.
Oh, you're out all the way?
Barbara!
Okay.
Yeah, I'm out all the way,
but you are a great salesman.
The challenge
is the valuation.
Katherine: Mm.
So let's talk about that.
I would love to see what you
guys think is a fair valuation,
because I really want
you guys --
You can't value it,
though, right?
-What you've done --
-Well, I think you can value.
You can't, though, because
what you've done is --
Well, you can.
You can take a guess at it.
If I had to write a check
as an angel,
I would say, "Look,
it's a great start."
I mean, it's always
a bit of a leap.
Yeah, but see...
To me, it's a $3.5 million
to $5 million company.
Then the next question,
Katherine,
is what's your core
competency, right?
And what your core competency is
just what you've said it is.
Growth hacking,
organized, promoting,
taking something and
getting it to a point
where you can ship it.
Right?
Now all the things
you haven't done
is where it becomes
a real business.
I think I'm an entrepreneur.
Honestly, to my core,
I'm an entrepreneur.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Right?
I can be pigeonholed
into these things for now.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are,
but you just came out here
and pigeonholed yourself...
[ Sighs ]
...into BetterBack.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
No! Don't go out!
No, I didn't hear it!
I didn't hear it.
<i>I</i> heard it.
Katherine, I got to go back
with my gut feel.
You have all of
the right answers.
Okay.
Um, I just don't see anywhere
close to the $10 million.
To me,
the business is worth...
$3.5 million, $5 million.
Because all the stuff that you
have to do hasn't been proven.
I mean, for $750,000,
which is a lot of money,
the equity is about 20%.
I mean, I look -- I see
the reaction on your face.
I mean, that's -- that's what
I would offer.
So you're effectively giving me
a 3x multiple
on my 1.5 months
of selling, yeah?
I'm betting on what you've
proven to me you're good at...
Mm-hmm.
...today and with
your background.
The unknown
is the risk factor.
That's why
I'm valuing it there.
Absolutely.
Katherine, give that
some serious thought.
Because you have to actually
go out and get the business.
So that valuation
is $3.75 million.
It's not unreasonable.
I'll make an offer,
but I'm actually looking at this
a little differently.
I'll do it for 25%,
'cause of the amount of work
I'm going to have to do
and the people that work --
So you're giving her
a <i>worse</i> offer.
It may be worse.
It may be better.
Well, my offer certainly looks
better now, doesn't it?
It does. Lori.
Guess what time it is,
Robert?
What time is it, Lori?
It's deal time.
Yes!
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.
Katherine has two offers on the
table for her posture corrector,
BetterBack, but Lori also
seems interested.
Guess what time it is,
Robert?
What time is it, Lori?
It's deal time.
Yes!
[ Laughter ]
See, here's the thing.
I don't always have the same
point of the view
as my fellow sharks.
Robert said you're a starter,
and, you see, I like that,
because I'm a closer.
And I have a product
that we launched on QVC.
Well, in a just a handful
of months,
we've done $5 million in sales.
Oh, my gosh!
Yeah.
You go, girl.
No lie. No lie.
That's awesome.
Wow.
And I think that this could work
very well with it.
This is a demonstrable product.
I love demonstrable products,
'cause I can show them on QVC
and my show.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I'm gonna give you
the $750,000,
but I'm gonna be at 20%.
[ Laughs ]
There's always a "but".
Herjavec: Oh, my gosh.
So the guy whose offer
you rolled your eyes at --
-I know.
-Let me tell you why.
Let me tell you why.
Because we all know
America has back pain.
Mm-hmm.
The thing you don't know is
what America's going to think
of the product.
You really need
to get it out there...
Absolutely.
...and it has to be certain
that they like it.
I mean, you're lucky to have
the offers on the table,
because we all -- it's like
rolling the dice.
-Crap out...
-And this is your roll the dice.
If you believe she's gonna
generate $5 million in sales,
it's a bargain.
-Right. Right.
-Here's another --
here's another option for you,
because I just like
to keep things interesting
in the Shark Tank.
Katherine: Please.
[ Laughs ]
If you really are concerned
about dilution...
I am.
...'cause you seem to be,
I'm very creative,
so I'll help you here.
[ Laughs ]
I look at this and say, if you
hit 50% of your forecast...
Mm-hmm.
...you can afford to pay me back
the $750,000
in the next 18 months,
all right?
I will loan you the $750,000.
I think it's an extraordinarily
large amount of money,
but I can securitize it
against your sales.
I'm gonna charge you 7.5%
for it, for 24 months.
You can pay me back any time you
want in any amounts you want,
and I want 5% equity
when we close the deal.
Katherine,
I love when he does that.
You know why?
[ Laughing ] Why?
Because then I decide
to do it, too.
[ Laughs ]
Yep.
When you have no creativity,
you have to copy.
So I'm gonna give you
the $750,000 as a loan.
I'll give you three years
to pay it back,
also at 7.5% interest,
but I'm gonna ask for 8%
of the company.
Basically, Lori's saying
that she's gonna sell
$5 million worth,
which will easily,
if the margins are
anything legit, right...
Absolutely.
...pay back the loan she's given
to you and interest.
Absolutely.
You know, for 8% of the company,
do you want to,
you know, get $5 million more
in sales?
-Yes.
-Come to me.
Come to me.
-Yes.
Are you saying yes
to Lori?
My one question is,
would you do it for the 7.5%?
Half a point
should not matter.
It shouldn't.
-That's exactly right.
Don't walk in
thinking in your head,
"Oh, but I wanted
the half a point."
You are a half a handshake away
from $5 million.
All you need to do is be the
other part of the handshake.
Okay. I'm gonna phone my friend,
you guys.
Thank you so much.
-What?!
You got to be kidding me.
I'm gonna be right back.
-She gave you --
You don't know?
You don't know?
Do not take this away
from me.
-Never leave the Shark Tank.
-No guarantee.
-Katherine, this is
business 101.
-No guarantee.
-Somebody offered you
what you're asking --
-The good news is I'm coachable.
I'm coachable.
Lori, you got a deal!
-Oh, my gosh.
-Better idea.
Thank God.
Good.
Good, good.
I'm really excited.
Thank you.
Congrats.
-Let's go!
-Congratulations.
Come on!
Go, before Lori
changes her mind.
[ Laughter ]
I love you, Lori.
Yay!
We did it, we did it,
we did it.
I went with Lori's offer today
because Lori is the queen!
She's amazing!
What a badass businesswoman
as well as just human being.
I'm looking forward to getting
the mentorship and learning --
learning her chops.
Narrator:
Earlier this season,
Jess Edelstein and Sarah Ribner
struck a deal
with Barbara Corcoran
for their all-natural
deodorant PiperWai.
Would you be willing
to go down to 25%?
Yes, I will.
What?!
Deal.
Narrator: Let's see what
they're up to now.
