I'm Brittney Scarlett.
And I'm her
brother Skyler.
We live in beautiful
Carmel, California.
11 months ago,
we started this business.
We were both dissatisfied
with our jobs at the time,
and we saw
a huge opportunity.
So we took a huge
leap of faith,
and we opened
this business in Carmel.
-Doing okay?
-Yep.
We have a cutting edge
spa therapy
aimed at reducing inflammation
in the body.
I looked into this and I saw
many professional athletes
are swearing
by the therapy.
I tried it with my sister,
and we both got hooked on it.
-How's business been going?
-Business is good.
Our family has made
great sacrifices
for us to open up
this business.
Our dad actually
sold his house
to help us finance
our equipment.
And I live in a barn
on my mom's property.
There's no hot water,
there's no cable,
and there's bats,
but it's a sacrifice
that I'm willing to make
for my company right now.
If we can sell the sharks
on this new therapy,
hopefully we can get America
to give it a shot, too.
Hi, sharks, my name
is Skyler Scarlett.
And I am
Brittney Scarlett.
We're from Carmel Valley,
California,
and together,
we're known as...
BOTH: The ice siblings!
Our company is
Glacé Cryotherapy.
We are here today seeking
a $100,000 investment
for 15% equity
in our company.
Whole body cryotherapy is a
cutting-edge, cool technology...
literally.
It all begins when you step
inside our cryosauna.
Wow.
-Oh, man.
-It's cool looking.
For up to three minutes,
cool, dry air
is circulated
around your body
at up to 250 degrees
below zero.
Cryotherapy is for
reducing inflammation,
and when you reduce
inflammation,
you will notice
less aches and pains,
decreased muscle soreness,
and have an overall better
sense of wellbeing.
We can help people naturally
manage their pain,
reduce their needs
for medications
to the point that after
consistent cryotherapy sessions,
they feel like
a brand-new person.
And there are many
other benefits.
Endorphins and adrenaline
are released,
increasing your energy
and improving your mood.
There is a calorie burn,
and it's also good
for your skin,
as it increases collagen
production.
How much to freeze
Mark Cuban's head?
[ Laughter ]
Well, Robert,
we know you're a sports guy.
Would you be interested
in getting in here
and trying it out?
I'd love to try it.
Sure.
-All right. Awesome.
-We'd love to put you in here.
So what you're gonna do,
Robert,
is you're gonna go
right behind that.
There's a robe back there
for you,
so you're gonna take everything
except for your underwear...
You're gonna take off
all your clothes.
...and you're gonna put on socks
and gloves and shoes and a robe.
I can't --
No one's
gonna see you naked.
Don't worry.
I'll make sure nobody sees.
How long do you stay in there?
Up to three minutes.
We try to get people to go
at least two minutes,
but never longer
than three.
Well, good news they
didn't ask me, 'cause
I'm going commando.
[ Laughter ]
Skyler: Oh, awesome.
All right.
He's ready.
Corcoran:
Nice socks, Robert.
Robert,
looks like your mug shot.
Don't worry, no one
can see you in here, all right?
No one can see you
in here.
Does it get cold?
It's gonna get cold.
Yep.
Guess what, Robert.
You won't be having any more
children after this.
No.
Robert, the good news is,
as cold as you get in here,
the second you get out,
you're gonna immediately
heat up, all right?
You're going from negative
about 220 Fahrenheit
to room temperature.
Nothing is wet on you.
It's completely dry.
It's not that cold.
It's completely dry
and it's very tolerable.
-Very, very tolerable.
-How does it feel?
Oh, it's pretty cold now.
[ Laughter ]
You're doing great.
All right.
What is the ma--
What is the maximum level?
Chin up a little bit.
The maximum level is level 3.
That can get as cold
as about negative 280.
-Give him five.
-You want level five?
O'Leary:
Give him five.
Corcoran: Robert, are you
regretting that you're in there?
You gonna make me a deal
if I do level five?
Oh, my God!
All right.
You're gonna heat up
immediately.
It's just the cool, dry air,
so you're not getting wet.
Now we know how to pack him
and ship him. [ Laughs ]
Watch your step,
all right?
Whoa, Robert!
Watch your step. Now
I'm gonna take your skin
temp on your ankle, okay?
Okay.
So we have him
at 32 degrees.
So normally,
we're 88 to 94.
When they go in here, the magic
is dropping the skin temp,
and that's where all
the science happens.
[ Laughter ]
Are you still cold, Robert?
-It's freaking cold!
-I guarantee you.
Give it about five minutes,
he's gonna feel
really, really good.
He's gonna feel relaxed. He's
gonna feel really comfortable.
[ Laughter ]
He's just being dramatic
right now.
How does it not
burn your skin?
Three minutes.
So we never go past three.
That's the key.
Do I look younger?
How do you feel?
I feel great.
What happens?
You get in there.
It, uh, it starts
slowly,
and then it gets
<i>really</i> cold.
Yeah.
Like all of a sudden, it goes
from tolerable to -- boom!
So we get that --
we get that it's cold.
Yes.
Okay.
Is there a business?
Tell us
what's going on there.
We started 11 months ago
in Carmel.
We've done $140,000 in sales,
$115,000 in gross profit.
Did you have expenses, though,
of a rental space or a spa?
Our overhead
is really great.
It's about $3,200 a month.
We have our own office.
We call it
a cryotherapy spa,
and our main expense
is gonna be gas,
and that's really it.
There's a lot of places
like this.
When I was on
"Dancing With the Stars",
all the dancers went to this.
-Yeah.
The Mavericks started using this
five years ago.
What's the difference
between you and the place
down the street?
Skyler, what stops me in Boston
from just buying gas,
a thing like that,
and calling it
Mr. Wonderful's
Freeze-a-tron?
There's, honestly,
there's nothing from
stopping you to do that.
You can go buy a unit try to do
Mr. Wonderful's cryotherapy.
So what do you got?
So the question we're asking
you, then -- why are you here?
It's the experience that we feel
that we provide.
It's working well for you
in Carmel, right?
We want the investment for
another Glacé in San Francisco.
Yes.
That's what we want
the investment for.
One machine.
What is the cost of one machine?
It's $55,000.
-Wow.
-$55,000.
Skyler, I've got a question
for you. Help me with this.
If I give you $100,000 for 15%
of the business, okay?
But I can buy the unit
for $55,000...
That's true.
...hire two Brittney-Skyler
guys...
You can try to.
...and own the whole thing
myself!
Yeah.
And I'll keep 100%
of the company.
We -- We feel that we have
the best practice.
Come on.
You have nothing.
Brittney, here's the --
What does it cost to do this?
A single session
would be $65.
Oh, that's cheap.
But we mostly sell
monthly memberships
that are about $390.
So, $65...
-Right.
-And then how many times
do you have to go
to see a result?
Most people are coming
anywhere between one to five
times a week.
Skyler, it works.
Yes.
-You didn't invent the process.
-Let's give it it works.
So let's talk about
your business.
-Why is it --
-Oh, God. Don't go again.
My issue is not with the fact
that whether it works or not.
You're just a retail store.
You're no different than
any other retail store.
Yeah. I don't believe we're just
like everyone else.
Okay.
Really, our training is
completely different.
You know, I think
there's really an art
to putting people
in here.
You can't just
throw them in there,
push a button
and "All right."
We get multiple requests
to be a Glacé.
They know they can do this
on their own.
Your premise is that
you're so unique
in your ability to help people
use the technology
that I should give you $100,000
and only get 15% when I can buy
it myself for $55,000.
-Ay-yi-yi.
-I'm stuck there.
I'm stuck there, because you
have nothing! Nothing!
If you want to do
Mr. Wonderful's cryotherapy --
I'm out.
You -- you guys have
a fundamental problem,
but it's not
what Kevin says.
It's absolutely
what Kevin said.
There are a lot of successful
service businesses...
Yeah.
...where people who provide
better service succeed,
but there's only
two of you.
And so trying to open up
that second location --
you don't have
the people to do it,
yet you're coming,
asking for money from us
to do it without the people
to do it.
That's a big hurdle
to overcome.
I'm out.
All right.
Thank you.
Thanks for your time,
Mark.
You're welcome.
I don't have a problem
with the fact
that you didn't invent this.
Someone's gonna create a brand
around this.
My challenge is all you want to
do is open up one more store.
If this really is gonna be
a national coverage model,
the person who's gonna win
is the one who's gonna be
out there more.
You've got to come out
with a game plan,
and you didn't come out with
a good game plan for me today.
I'm out.
Sorry to hear that.
Thank you.
Robert,
thank you for your time.
I think
it's really interesting.
I'm fascinated
by the science of it.
This is a great business for
you, but I think, at this point,
not investable for me,
so I'm out.
Thank you.
Thanks, Lori.
Barbara's left.
I just can't believe
why the other sharks
aren't all over this.
The magic sauce in this
is you make money
from the get-go.
Nothing is more appealing
to a franchisee
than making a killing fast.
Than make immediate money.
Boom.
That's your number-one question,
and you've already
demonstrated that.
Barbara, you would kill it
with these guys.
The problem is
they're gonna be --
I don't need your problem --
bup, bup, bup, bup.
I'm just telling you.
Thank you very much,
Mark Cuban.
Stick to your basketball.
[ Laughs ]
This is my space here.
-[ Laughs ]
-Okay.
I will definitely build this
to a million-dollar business
in sales within the first year,
because I know exactly
how to do it, all right?
So I'm gonna give you
the $100,000 for 30%.
If you don't take that,
you should freeze yourselves.
You're not telling secrets,
are you?
All right, Barbara.
We got a deal.
This is a no-brainer.
You're our girl.
You know what?
You fit in with my family.
You're the good guys.
-Hey, I love you.
-I love you back.
-Oh, my gosh.
-Thank you all.
Good luck, guys.
Nice to meet you.
-Oh, my God.
-Whoo!
That's unbelievable.
That's the American dream
right there.
Well, Barbara, you've proved us
wrong in the past.
-That's so ridiculous.
-You know what's wrong with you?
You give no value
to the entrepreneur.
These kids are golden.
Be one
with the nothingness.
Be one.
Embrace it.
