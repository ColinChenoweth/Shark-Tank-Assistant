Hello, sharks.
My name is Mohamed Mohamed.
No, I didn't stutter,
and yes, I love it.
I'm from Oakland, California,
and I'm the founder and CEO
of LINKA.
I'm seeking $250,000 in exchange
for 10% equity of my company.
When I've had a long day
at work,
I can at least leave
with a smile on my face
knowing I get to dodge traffic
by riding my bike home.
I get some exercise in
and even relieve some stress
while I'm at it,
but nothing would wipe that
smile off my face quicker
than coming outside to realize
my bike had been stolen.
This is the story of 1 million
Americans each year.
I was fed up with bike theft.
I knew I had to do something
about it,
and that's why I'm so excited
to introduce to you LINKA,
the world's smartest
bike lock.
It stays there, so you're always
ready to lock up.
No keys, no bags.
When you're ready to lock,
simply tap a button
and a hardened steel ring
slides into place,
making it impossible
to ride away.
And when you're ready to go,
LINKA will recognize you
as you approach
and automatically unlock.
LINKA is not just
smart hardware,
but our app will even
keep you posted
on your LINKA's battery life
and keep you up to date
on the history
of bike theft
in your neighborhood.
It will even recommend
safer places to park
and advise how to get there.
Sharks, more than two bikes are
stolen every minute in the US,
and this epidemic continues
to get worse and worse
the more and more cycles
hit the streets.
The need is there,
LINKA has the answer.
So who's ready to lock in
a deal with LINKA
and help us all lock smarter,
not harder?
What's to stop someone
from picking up your bike
and putting it in their car?
Well, that's a good question.
Why don't you come try it
for yourself?
See if I can pick it up?
[ Imitates buzzer ]
-Well, maybe come bring
the muscles.
Let me try.
Bring the muscles and just try
to lift this guy up right here.
-So that's a great question.
-Great question.
So I come up to it,
the steel thing goes in.
Mm-hmm.
Right?
Just pick it up.
You're trying to steal it.
Right.
Greiner: There he goes.
[ Alarm beeps ]
Yeah, well, you got to do that
with a 30-pound bike.
Close the doors!
You got to do that with
a 30-pound bike on your arm,
and at the same time,
you receive a tamper alert.
The user receives a tamper alert
on their phone,
letting them know that somebody
just tried to steal their bike.
So how does it stop the bike?
It stops the wheel from going?
-Right.
-You can't cut that off?
-Correct.
The proximity of where
the lock is mounted
makes it very difficult
for anybody to access
with bolt cutters --
Herjavec:
Oh, it's a tamper warning.
Yeah.
There's a reason people
chain their bike
to something hard
is so nobody can pick it up.
That's totally fair.
Like, the alarm goes off --
who cares?
Yeah, well, <i>you</i> care.
You're the one who is receiving
the alarm.
No, the crook cares because
you're carrying something
that everybody's gonna hear,
and on top of that, you still
got to get that thing off
in order for it
to have any value.
I don't know. I think you're
still gonna need a hard chain
to put something physical
to it.
Greiner: Is there --
I was gonna say, is there --
That's why we have a mounted
add-on noose chain.
There is.
So you can pick the
option with the chain
or without the chain.
-Where?
-It's right here.
It's mounted
onto the frame.
You can actually take this,
grab the front wheel
and the back wheel --
directly hooked on.
Okay, so, see, that works.
How much is it?
$129 MSRP.
-And what's it cost you?
-$45.
And if you add on the chain,
I'm into it for not $139,
but how much?
Uh, $159.
$159.
And how many have you sold,
Mohamed?
We launched a Kickstarter
campaign back in May.
and we actually did five times
our desired goal.
We hit about $130,000.
What are your sales
since then?
Sales since then --
about $40,000.
What is your background?
My background -- actually,
I didn't go a top-tier school
or an Ivy League school.
I went to The City College
of New York.
That's a better school than most
of those schools.
Thank you.
And I had the opportunity
to finish my mechanical
engineering degree there.
-Hey.
-And shortly after,
I started working for Toyota
as a manufacturing engineer,
so my background is heavily
in manufacturing and quality.
I also want to say something
about where I come from
and what makes me here --
what helps me come here.
Good for you.
Want to hear it.
I -- my parents immigrated
to this country
to help make my brother's life
and I a lot better.
And they sacrificed --
Where are you
from originally?
Egypt.
So they immigrated here
and they wanted to make
our lives better,
and they wanted
to help us succeed,
and they sacrificed
so much.
They left their family
and they left everything
they knew
to bring us here.
And I can't repay
them enough,
so I'm doing everything I can
every single day.
So go back to -- it's on there.
I'm coming out.
How does it open?
It automatically unlocks as it
recognizes your proximity
through BTLE --
Bluetooth low energy.
Corcoran: Mohamed,
I'm your perfect customer.
I ride a bike every single
morning of my life,
but when I park my bike,
there's something psychological
when I put that chain
around a post.
-Right.
-It makes me feel good.
When you don't have anything
that looks like a deterrent
to a thief in a big city
like New York,
I think it almost says,
"Come and get it."
I mean, that's a gentle alarm,
and I don't think it's enough
of a deterrent
to really have a practical
application,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
I'm with Barbara
on this one.
I mean, I think,
in larger cities,
you're looking
for a deterrent.
You're looking for a heavy chain
that a guy walks by
and that's what stops it
from being stolen.
It's a quick thing.
So I will say, we're going
to Amsterdam on Tuesday.
This trip to Amsterdam,
we already have 45 meetings
lined up
with distributors, retailers,
biking manufacturers.
Why Amsterdam?
'Cause that's the capital
of the bike world.
Amsterdam has
a one-to-one ratio
between bikes and citizens.
I had my house broken into
many years ago.
I called in the police
and I said to them,
"What's the best alarm system
in the world that I can buy?"
You know what the police officer
said to me?
-Dog.
-"Buy a dog."
I said, "Why a dog?
How's a dog gonna prevent
a break-in?"
"It's gonna make the burglar
think twice,"
and I think a chain
is the same way.
That, to me, doesn't look like
a deterrent.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I was hoping, when Robert
was running off with it
and it was beeping,
that it would send out 240 volts
and hit him.
And, like,
then he'd drop the bike.
I'd rather hear it say,
"You stole my bike.
This guy's a crook."
"You stole my bike, now watch
this". [ Imitates buzzer ]
You know,
we see better mouse traps
all the time in the Shark Tank.
The challenge is this market
is already served
by many solutions,
and you've put a value on it
of $2.5 million.
You want $250,000 from me
for 10%,
computes to $2.5 million value.
I mean, it's just --
I'm not excited
about the product category,
mostly.
I find the valuation probably
about 50% too rich.
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I mean, in terms of
the product itself,
the product has so much
potential.
I like the invention.
I think it's clever,
but I think that it has to be
a much louder alarm.
I'm a city girl.
I wouldn't have even heard that.
It would've been
white noise for me.
I wish you great luck,
but for me right now,
it's not investable.
I'm out.
Seriously,
we did our research.
We talked to 300
different customers
before we even started.
I don't think anybody here's
doubting your preparation,
the quality of the product,
the need for the product...
All excellent.
Yeah,
we all think it's clever.
The issue is the competition.
Right?
You're trying to build,
as someone said earlier,
a better mouse trap.
That -- that's brutally
competitive.
That's why you're having
to go to Amsterdam,
but if it was just
such an easy sale
and just a blow-away
opportunity,
you'd have
your hands full here.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
-Good luck to you.
-Good luck, Mohamed.
Good luck, Mohamed.
