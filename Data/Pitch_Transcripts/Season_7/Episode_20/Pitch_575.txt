My name is Allison DeVane,
and I'm from Goodyear, Arizona.
Today I am seeking $50,000
in exchange for 10%
of my company, TEASPRESSA.
During my nine years in the
coffee and tea industry,
I've noticed that coffee lovers
really like coffee
because of the caffeine
and the rich texture,
however they're not huge fans
of the jitters and the crash.
I think that most people know
that tea is a healthier option,
but let's face it,
it's not as fun to drink.
That is, until now!
TEASPRESSA is concentrated
tea shots
made just like
gourmet coffee drinks.
It is not your ordinary tea bag
dunked into water,
because we make it in a way
that is just like espresso.
In fact, because of that,
it has a bold flavor,
rich consistency
just like coffee,
and just as much caffeine,
except without the jitters
and the crash.
We are revolutionizing
in a lucrative space
to help introduce this new
gourmet tea product, TEASPRESSA,
to the world.
And now it's tea time, sharks.
Today we have prepared for you
some of our most popular drinks.
-Ooh.
-Wow.
-Yeah, smoothies.
-Ooh-la-la.
-Yeah.
-Fancy.
So we have the Cucumber
Green Tea Lemonade.
-Thank you.
-This is a Black Rose Latte.
-This is really good.
-That's nice.
I'm glad you like it.
Has a florally
kind of taste.
And this is
the Black Vanilla Latte.
And then this is probably
our most creative drink,
the London Fog.
It's our earl gray with vanilla
and a splash of lavender.
Thank you.
And this is our most wildly
popular decaffeinated tea.
It has caramel in it.
-Cool.
Wow, like a dessert.
Allison, is the business
a retail store?
Like, what -- what is it?
Um, the business
is the tea shots itself.
I actually have a patent pending
on the process.
Show us the package.
Greiner: What does somebody
buy from you?
Herjavec: Yeah.
So I have them right now --
they're available
at a store.
Thank you.
So this is what I buy.
This is your product.
I have that
and I also have it available
in a store in Phoenix.
How I started was I did
pop-up shops in Arizona,
and then I just decided
I was going to make this
my full-time job.
I'm like
"I'm gonna give it a go,
'cause I've always wanted
to start a business."
So I hustled every day,
I live with my parents --
it's cool -- and actually
had an opportunity
to be the exclusive tea provider
for a store in Phoenix,
and so they love the product
so much,
they're like, "Oh my goodness.
You're perfect.
Let's put it in there."
And since then I have made
about $26,000 in sales
in five months
just from the tea alone.
Allison, you got to tell me how
I'm turning this into a product.
Allison: Yes.
So I have to buy
that little pot?
Yes.
Okay.
So now I need that
and I need the pot.
Yes.
Then what happens?
So, um, you make it
in the pot,
and then what you make is
something similar to that,
but it's not quite
the experience
that you have at the store.
That's not your product,
though.
This --
this is my product.
-The tea pot is?
-Just this.
Cuban:
How do I buy this?
Online.
Okay, so I go
to your website.
-Yes.
-What do I pay for it?
That is $12.
Greiner:
And so, just so it's clear...
-Yes.
-...two different things.
-Yes.
-You're in a shop in Arizona.
-Yes. Yes.
-Which you partially own?
Is that what you said?
-And you are serving and making
different teas.
-Yes.
-And you are also now
selling online...
-Yes.
-...the tea bags and the pot.
-Yes.
What is your plan?
What are you seeing to do here?
I want to be the person known
that made tea cool.
I have the trademark pending
for TEASPRESSA itself.
I have the patent pending
for the process itself.
The -- The patent includes
the brewing --
So am I investing
in the machine?
The technology
for it, yes.
Oh, you're gonna make
a machine.
Mm-hmm.
O'Leary: And you're gonna sell
a machine also.
I thought you were
making these.
Okay, so, you know, I must say,
at this point...
-[ Laughing ] It's confusing.
-...Barbara's very confused.
You told us
this is the product,
then you told us you're telling
a technology,
then you told us
you're in retail,
then you told us you're
in a store making them,
then you told us
you're online.
Can you see
why we're confused?
It's been very aggressive.
I'm a hustler.
-I see.
-I started --
-No, I know.
-No, but can you -- can you --
But we're not sure what
you're hustling, Allison.
-Yeah.
-That's the problem.
O'Leary:
So far in this presentation,
it's like you came
into the Shark Tank...
-Yes.
...someone rolled in
a dish-washing machine,
threw you in it, and we're
hearing every third word
as you go rotating
through the cycle.
Greiner:
Here's what's confusing.
What is it that --
that you're selling?
Are you selling
that machine there,
or do you want to be selling
those things up there?
Well, the store that I
have is more so a proof
of concept. And --
A what c-- okay.
A proof of concept, that people
love your espresso shots.
Allison: Right. It's kind of
been a great creative outlet.
People -- I've ben having lots
of, um, different kinds
of press.
I just do large publications,
like, logos on latte art.
I do, like, pineapples
or crazy designs
to a lot of doors for press.
Allison, how does this equate
back to this product?
Okay, um...
There's a scene
in a famous movie
where a trap door opens
and you fall
into a real shark tank.
I think we're almost there
with you.
of Allison's tea company,
TEASPRESSA.
O'Leary: There's a scene
in a famous movie
where a trap door opens
and you fall
into a real Shark Tank.
I think we're almost there
with you.
All right.
So give it a good shot.
Give it a good shot.
-Aw.
-Make me understand
why a $50,000 investment
with you is worth it.
Okay.
With the $50,000,
I plan on making my website
absolutely tailored to sell.
Sell, sell, sell,
and then to develop --
finish developing these,
'cause I know what I need,
I know how to make
one of these.
I feel like now there's been
a lot of, you know, like,
you see a lot of coffee shops
and even Starbucks
investing in new
tea inventions,
and so right now,
it seems to be the time,
especially with the health trend
going up,
where people are looking
for healthier alternatives,
and that's the reason
why I'm actually here...
Allison. Folks --
Go ahead.
...is because I-I do --
I do need guidance.
Corcoran:
Here's the thing.
The need for you to communicate
more clearly, I think,
is the, really, only thing
you're doing wrong here,
but anticipating what it would
be like in that partnership,
I would have to say
that I'm out.
Okay.
-Let me help, Allison.
Allison, look.
I...
Deep breath.
That's the hardest part
to be in,
particularly when you're
coming in with a vision
and you're trying to learn
as you go, right?
So just a deep breath.
You've got this big vision --
"I want to make tea
better than coffee
and have people just
as committed to tea
as they are to coffee."
You did a great job
of articulating that.
Right. Right.
The problem is
you just came too early.
Right? Because you're
learning business.
It's nearly impossible
to figure out a vision,
execute that vision,
and learn how to be
a businessperson
at the same time.
But what you haven't
conveyed yet
is that you understand
the business part of it.
I know my margins.
But you've got to know
more than that.
Look, while I think you've got
a great vision,
I've got to say the words:
I'm out.
Okay.
Herjavec: Allison, it's a
testament to your character
and your exuberance
and your excitement
that we're all still talking
to you.
Any other person that would come
out here with that presentation
would've lasted a couple
of minutes.
Excitement, though,
is not a focus.
At this stage, you need
singularity of focus.
I'm out.
Okay.
These taste great.
Every shark loved them.
Delicious.
But in business,
you have to crawl
and then you walk
and then you run.
Right.
So you just have to take
each step one by one.
And I think that if you do that,
you can make it.
Today you came in
a little too early,
and for that reason, I'm out,
but just focus and bite away
at each inch.
I mean, I promise --
I know that that came out
like word vomit.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you very much.
Don't look at this
as a failure.
No.
Look at it as a failure.
Shut up, Kevin.
Allison:
Honestly, to be here,
it was kind of intimidating
because I just started...
[ Voice breaking ]
but this is something
that I'm so extremely
passionate about, and I...
[ Sniffles ]
Greiner: That's the thing.
If you're so really passionate
about it,
you will make it happen.
You're young.
You have a lot of years
ahead of you.
-I know.
-Keep working at it.
Yeah, you don't know
where that's been.
[ Laughter ]
Good luck, Allison.
-Good luck.
-Good luck, Allison.
-Thank you.
-Bye.
Allison: [ Voice breaking ]
That was really hard.
Probably one of the best
experiences,
but the hardest thing I've done,
for sure.
I feel like it really does hurt
right now,
but [sniffles] I know I can turn
this into motivation
to do better.
