Hi, I'm Jeremiah Robison
from Provo, Utah.
My company is Beloved Shirts,
and I am seeking $175,000
in exchange for 5%.
The problem with the world today
is that it's just too serious.
So we as a society
woke up one day,
and everything
was just plain boring.
So to combat the
over-seriousness of the world,
I came up with Beloved Shirts.

I'm actually
a huge introvert,
so you'd think I'd be fine
going by unnoticed
in whatever lifeless clothes
I was wearing before,
but my real personality,
which is a lot weirder
than I let on,
wouldn't stand
for a serious Jeremiah.
So here I am,
a man hugging a unicorn,
asking for you
to invest in my idea.
Together, we can make the world
a lot more colorful.
I got some customized samples
I want to pass out.
-John: Great.
-Greiner: Great.
He's the pizza man.
-Are those pizza slices?
Yes, it's pepperoni.
All right.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
Looking good.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.
Thank you.
-Lori...
-[ Laughs ]
If you're nice, you might
get this for Christmas.
That's gonna go over big
at my house. I can tell.
[ Laughter ]
So what --
what's the business?
That was just for fun,
to show us the product.
Yeah, so,
what we're passionate about
is just creating apparel
that warrants a reaction.
It's a way
to express yourself.
We feel like we're selling
an experience
and not just
a product here.
Katy Perry had that fleece on
a few years ago.
Yeah, Katy Perry is
our biggest influencer by far.
But was that pizza one yours
that she wore?
Yeah.
That was ours.
We didn't reach out
to her at all.
This was totally random,
and she just loves the brand.
What -- What does it cost?
Onesies -- by far our most
expensive item -- $129 retail.
And what's a t-shirt cost?
T-shirt costs $39.95.
And what are your margins?
Our cost to goods sold
percentage range
is between 58% and 60%
right now.
Everything's made in the USA.
Cuban: How many, um, different
products do you have?
How much to you typically have
dollar-wise in inventory?
So, to start this business, I
didn't invest in any inventory.
Like, in fact, all I needed
was $300 for my first sample.
So everything's made-to-order,
and that, you know,
it's bittersweet.
It has its pros -- we don't have
to invest in inventory,
we can put whatever we want
to market right away,
Jeremiah, what were
your sales last year?
Last year,
we did $2.3 Million.
-Cuban: Good for you.
-Nice.
$2.3 Million?
How long you been in business?
-Two and a half years.
-Wow.
How much did you make
on the $2.3 million?
Last year,
our net profit was 10%.
Jeremiah, I think you deserve
a lot of congratulations
-for having built this.
-Thank you.
You know, um,
you've had a lot of success,
but I don't think
you've really
got your act
completely together yet.
You're still kind of
operating by the --
the pizza of your pants,
you know?
[ Chuckles ]
And so you come here looking for
a shark for that help,
-which is a good thing...
-Yeah.
...but I don't think
you're there yet,
and so for that reason,
I'm out.
Appreciate that.
Herjavec: Jeremiah, I think
it's an incredible job --
$2.5 million from zero
in two and a half years...
-Thank you.
-...it's really fun stuff,
but I've already invested
in a fun company
called Tipsy Elves.
It's too similar a market
for me.
-I'm out.
-Appreciate it. Thanks.
I think you're very SKU-heavy,
which, to me,
it seems you probably know
or can figure out
what are your top 50 sellers,
top 20 sellers.
You know, hone it in.
I would feature and work on
and maybe start to inventory
and warehouse the tops
so that then you can
ship them out immediately.
-It's the Lori-advice tank.
-Yeah, well --
I'm glad
you brought that up,
'cause that's
what we're doing right now.
We've actually reduced
the amount of SKUs, you'll see,
by a third already
just last month,
-so we're sifting through them.
-But this would allow you --
if you think you're losing
all your customers,
only a 1% conversion rate
because they see it's 30 days...
-Uh-huh.
-All you have to do
-is warehouse the top 10 things.
-Great idea.
Great warehouses here.
Ship them out overnight.
Problem solved.
You know?
I would suggest to do that.
For me, I don't feel
that this is investable
And unfortunately, Jeremiah,
I'm gonna have to forbid Daymond
from doing this deal.
He needs -- He's going to have
to get at least 17.5%
or I won't allow it.
-I'm out.
-Thanks.
I have so many levels
of concern.
You offered 5%.
Why just 5%?
You know,
I'm willing to negotiate.
5% is the starting point.
I'm prepared to give away
more equity if necessary.
Because
there's a lot of work here,
I have to -- I have to offer you
the $175,000 for 25%.
I permit that deal.
