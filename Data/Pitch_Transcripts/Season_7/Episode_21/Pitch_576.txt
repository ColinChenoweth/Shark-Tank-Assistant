Schwartz:
My name is Henry Schwartz.
I'm from Madison, Wisconsin,
and my company is MobCraft Beer.
Cheers.
I love beer.
I love it so much that,
in college,
my buddies and I decided
to start brewing our own beer
to see what we could
come up with.
It was so good, our friends
and family were asking for more,
and everyone had suggestions
for what they wanted us
to brew next.
All right.
We kept increasing
the size of our batches
and soon partnered up
with a local brewery.
Next thing we knew, we had
our own craft beer company.
Craft beer is a wildly growing
segment in the beer industry.
People are seeing the value
and care
that goes into creating
small batches,
and they want to support local
and independent producers.
How about we do
an old-fashioned sour.
Yes.
Right now, we can't keep up
with the demand for our beer
with the limited capacity
that we have.
Our next step
is to build our own facility
and start cranking out
lots more beer.
There's huge growth potential
for us going forward,
and a Shark would really make
that dream come true
to help us grow
our brand nationwide.
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Henry Schwartz,
and I'm the president
of MobCraft Beer.
Today, we're seeking $400,000 in
exchange for 16% of our company.
At MobCraft, we put the consumer
in the driver's seat
and turn their ideas into beer.
MobCraft is the world's first
crowdsourced brewery,
marrying the business model
of crowdsourcing
and the industry of craft beer.
We use 21st-century technology
and the power of the crowd
to create unique craft beers.
We give our customers voice
in two ways.
One --
they submit ideas for beers,
and two --
they vote on what's brewed,
creating a direct,
emotional connection
and building brand loyalty.
So, here's how it works.
Say you love wheat beers,
and you want to try one with
coconut and cacao nibs in it.
You would submit your idea
to MobCraft's website.
From there, our brewmaster,
Andrew, vets that idea
and turns it
into a viable recipe.
It ends up in our monthly vote,
then against craft beer fans
from across the U.S.,
You rally your network
to get your beer brewed.
With an investment
from the Sharks,
we'll be able to build out
our own brewery
and crowdsource a lot more beer
to service the rest
of the United States.
I know it's happy hour,
and I got a flight of beers
for you guys.
Who wants a taste?
Yeah.
Rock on.
All right.
So, we got six beers
for you guys today.
If you just want to grab
a paddle there.
Herjavec: Wow.
All six for me?
Mm-hmm.
Which one first?
Starting at the head of
the paddle -- by the handle.
By the handle.
Remember that coconut
and chocolate wheat beer...
Salut!
...that I was talking about?
This was the crowdsourced winner
two months ago.
-That's really good.
-That's really good.
-That's really good.
-No, it's a weird taste.
I like this one a lot.
-Thank you.
-What's the second one?
Next down the line
is the Hop Gose the Grapefruit.
-Herjavec: Whoa.
-It has grapefruit in it?
It has grapefruit
and an ample amount of hops.
Wow!
That's really good.
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, it's not.
[ Laughs ] All right,
let's move to the third one.
This one
is our Bat... Crazy.
Why does it look
like a Guinness?
This is our silver medal winner
at the Great American
Beer Festival...
-Wow.
-...from last year.
Is there coffee in it?
5.6% ABV coffee beer.
-Ahh.
-I'm drinking coffee and beer?
Yep.
Ew!
Interesting.
The next one down
is the Vanilla Wafer Porter.
Vanilla Wafer?
This was the winner
in last month's voting round.
Greiner: I love this.
It's very tasty.
This is fabulous.
Oh, my God.
This is awful.
All right. And the next two
are very interesting beers.
These are both sour beers.
This is a sour Belgian double.
-Mnh.
-Is there cider in it?
Oh, that's got vinegar
in it.
It's brewed very similar
to a Belgian style.
[Yell, coughs ]
-I like it.
-You do?
I do.
This one's really good.
What's the last one?
Schwartz: This one
is also a sour beer.
Um, this one's
a sour red ale.
O'Leary:
That is really bad.
Oh, my God.
That's so good.
-That's vinegar.
-Disgusting.
Who drinks vinegar
like that?
-This is really good.
-That's disgusting.
Greiner: Well, at least
we've had a huge variety.
That last one
is just brutal.
So if you can imagine
the people that are...
-Horrible!
-...submitting these ideas
"Henry, you love skateboarding
and you want to work
at a skateboard shop.
Why don't you see
if you can buy it?"
I said, "Mom,
I'm 15 years old.
How could I buy
a skateboard store?"
And she said, "You are
passionate about this.
If you put your mind to it,
you can achieve it."
So we bought
that skateboard store.
I ran it for three years
throughout high school,
tripled the floorspace
and inventory.
-Wow.
-What did you pay for it?
Uh, we paid about
$8,000 for it,
built it up to about $50,000
in revenues
as a 15- to 18-year-old.
And, Henry, how do people
find you?
Are you doing beer events?
We go to lots
of beer festivals.
So we started out just going
in the state of Wisconsin.
We went to every beer festival
that we could.
They buy our beer --
How many beer festivals
are there?
Do they have Oktoberfest?
That was 65 beer festivals
in Wisconsin.
Wow.
In any geographic location,
there's multiple microbrewers.
This is a big trend
in beer.
Mm-hmm.
But that practically none
of them run at 100% capacity.
They run
at 40% to 60% -- 70%.
Mm-hmm.
So what I learned
about this business
is the killer
is the capital outlay
to build capacity to brew,
when everybody else has already
spent their money.
Yep.
I'm hooked on that.
I was hoping you'd say,
"Look, we use spare capacity
all around us."
Yeah, you know, we've --
we've looked into it,
and we've found
that with our customers,
the ones who really believe
that craft beer is a craft --
they want to see the beer
brewed on the home front.
So we've got commitment
from the bank,
finance $1.9 million
of our build-out.
So do you ever take one
out of the model
and then go to traditional
distribution?
Forget it.
That's exactly
what we are doing,
and that's what we've done.
We're in Madison
and we're in 75 liquor stores
and about 65 bars.
-How's it going?
It's going very well.
How much you making it for
and selling it
to those retailers at?
So, it depends
on the product segment.
24-pack of cans
costs us about 28 bucks.
It wholesales at $48.
Wow.
-That's...
-Wow.
That's tough.
This is
really premium stuff.
Mm-hmm.
Henry, what I thought you had
here when you came out --
you have these huge advocates
that are willing to spend an
inordinate amount of dollars...
-Mm-hmm.
-...per beer.
Crazy, because they're
part of this idea
that they could brew
their own.
Yep.
Everything else --
everything else puts you --
And would it help if I told you
that those people
were the retailers, as well?
-No, no, but hang on.
Everything else puts you
back in the competition
of the regular
beer business.
Once we have a few beers
that have been brewed and sold
in those new markets...
-Why do you feel so passionate
that you have to own
the equipment where
the beer is brewed? Why?
I think you have
a really clever, unique way
to go to market.
It's a very high-end
product,
but it's just not something
I have a passion for.
So I-I-I'm not a beer guy.
I'm out.
Fine.
Well, I r-- I really liked
the vanilla one.
Mm-hmm.
I thought the coffee one
was interesting.
Kitschy market --
I get it,
but I don't know enough
about brewing beer
and how people are
gonna buy.
I just can't see me
investing in this.
I'm out.
Okay.
Well, I-I hate beer.
So I can't help you. I'm out.
All right.
I love beer,
but I'm Bud Light.
This is not my taste.
I know it's a hot area.
It's just not for me.
So I'm out.
Henry, I think that you came up
with this incredible model
to tap into
this amazingly hot trend...
Mm-hmm.
...and you could make a ton
of money riding this wave.
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
Kevin is Henry's last chance
to get a deal
for his crowdsourced
beer company, MobCraft.
Henry, I think that you came up
with this incredible model
to tap into this
amazingly hot trend...
Mm-hmm.
...and you could make a ton
of money riding this wave.
But you want to get dragged
into the toilet?
Into retailing of beer
and building out facilities?
Are you out of your mind?
Why would you want to do that
to yourself?
I'll tell you why.
There's a big quality-control
issue in a lot of the beer
that you can make.
You're breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart, Henry.
It's something that we can't
maintain the quality
in someone else's facility,
and that is something that will
really disappoint the customers
and turn them away,
never to come back.
So maintaining
that facility on our own --
You know, I-I don't --
I don't believe that statement,
because, I mean, look --
I-It's such a shame.
I could show you
how to fix this
and make you millions
of dollars,
and you're too stubborn.
I want to spank you
like a baby seal.
-You got a paddle.
-You got a paddle right here.
Just, like,
that is such a mistake.
-Oh, my God.
-He welcomes the spank.
It's just -- that's terrible.
Listen, Henry.
I'm sorry.
I'm heartbroken.
It's such a cool model
with such a flaw.
What a crime.
Yeah. I don't believe that
that's true, but --
-Are you in?
-It's true.
I'm out.
Henry, thank you.
high-quality product.
-Greiner: Thanks, Henry.
-Thank you, guys.
Good luck.
Schwartz: Kevin thought
I was a little silly
for not outsourcing
my manufacturing,
but in the craft-beer world,
it's really important
to have an identity,
so I'm happy to be able to say
that we're gonna go through
and build out
our brewery facility
to make our wonderful beer.
Narrator: In season 4,
we watched cowboy Ryan Ehmann
make a deal with Daymond John
for his exercise DVDs
"Lose 12 Inches in 12 Workouts."
Now that's what
I'm talking about!
Let's see
what he's up to now.
These last three years
have been one heck of a ride.
Whee!
I did $80,000 in Internet sales
in 6 weeks after airing.
I was so sure that my online
business was gonna take off,
so I made the decision
to close my gym
and solely focus
on the Internet business.
All of a sudden,
the Internet sales dropped off
and I didn't know how
to pay my mortgage.
I was scared, you know?
I got two little kids at home.
I got a wife,
and there aren't...
I-I'm their rock.
It's all on my shoulders.
That's when Daymond showed me
his true colors
and sent me a check
to pay my mortgage.
He told me that I was the face
and the brand of the business
and I needed to get back on my
feet and build it back up again.
All right, ladies,
get on the bull!
All: Go!
I spent two years
working like crazy
to build a gym
that was rodeo-themed.
I call it Cowboys Gym.
Come on. Come on.
My gym has been so successful,
I'm opening my second location.
Between both gyms
and the Internet sales,
I generated over $750,000.
Cowboy!
-[ Laughs ]
-What's up?
I decided to help Ryan out
because we've become friends,
and I believed in him.
He just made some really bad
business moves,
but he learned his lessons
the hard way.
I love it.
This is truly different
than anything I've seen before,
and franchising Cowboy Ryan's
workout program
will definitely
put him on the map.
So glad that we stuck
with each other.
You can't give up, and if things
aren't going your way
in the business
you're working on,
you've just got to rework it.
You've got to just keep going.
And it's pretty amazing
where I'm at now.
Whoo-hoo!
All:
That's what I'm talking about!
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a fashion brand
that helps express
one's unique style.
