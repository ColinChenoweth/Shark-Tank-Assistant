Hey, sharks.
I'm Matt Alexander.
And I'm Mike Kannely, and
our product is IllumiBowl.
We're seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 15% of our company.
Thanks, Matt.
Here's the packaging, and
then you can take it out.
Greiner: Thank you.
John: Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
So, does this light
stay on, uh,
your entire visit to the --
to the bathroom?
Matt,
what's the difference --
I mean, why don't I just put
a night-light in the bathroom?
A lot of our --
our current customers
purchase this instead of
a night-light,
'cause the night-light's still
pretty bright when you walk in.
It lights up the whole room
and it wakes you up, and also,
this lights up just exactly
where you're aiming for --
-just headed to.
-If you're a guy.
Herjavec: You know,
when my kids were little,
we had night-lights
in all the rooms.
Like, the little,
green night-lights.
They're very soft.
You put them in there.
Kids would see
where the toilet is.
You're saying that it's better
because it's targeted.
-That's it.
-It is targeted.
-It's also very fun.
-It is fun. I'll give you that.
Is there any risk of electric
shock in the urine stream?
[ Laughter ]
-No. No.
-Zero.
Zero.
What happens when
you go to clean the toilet?
So the dirtiest parts
of the toilet
are actually the front
and the back.
That's why we designed it
to go on the side.
And then you just wipe
it off with whatever you
clean your toilet with.
How does that come on and off?
Can you take it on and off?
Yeah, so it just
suction-cups on and off.
-Oh, it's a suction.
-Oh, it's a suction cup.
You adjust it
to your toilet size --
Matt,
how many have you sold?
We've sold 6,500 units.
How much is it?
$100,000.
We did a kickstarter
around last November.
Wait, wait.
Wh-- how much is it?
-$100,000 total.
-Oh, oh.
How much is the unit?
I'm sorry.
-You sold 6,500.
-How much is each one?
-What does each one cost?
-We're selling them for $19.99.
And you've done $100,000
all on kickstarter.
-All on kickstarter.
-What's your landed cost?
Landed cost is $3.98, and
that's packaged and assembled.
-Oh!
-Whoa!
Oh, my God!
Kevin, that could have been
your pee-pee!
-What happened?
-[ Laughs ] Oh, my God.
Fortunately, the actual product
is actually a lot smaller,
so there's no risk
of that happening.
Yeah, you don't have giant
toilets falling on you.
Bringing down the house.
That was scary.
Do you guys
have any retail today?
Do you have any
retail sales?
Not yet, and we're meeting with
retailers now.
What are you gonna do
with the money?
Inventory.
So the vision is,
we're gonna launch online
beginning in a couple of weeks,
when we get our im--
when we import,
and we'll fulfill
all those pre-orders,
and then we've been meeting with
just local stores.
Some -- through Krogers, there's
a Smith's stores in Utah,
and they want to get it in all
their stores to do a local run.
And she can get us in faster,
and then we've been meeting with
some Ace Hardwares, 'cause
they can do individual buys,
and just work our way into
larger retail stores.
Down the road, we're actually
looking into projecting images.
-You could get --
-Projecting images?
-What --
-What would you project
on a turd?
[ Laughter ]
Well, a football team
you don't like.
[ Laughter ]
There you go.
Herjavec: Stop it!
The horror! The horror!
I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.
I'll buy every run you have.
Aim right for the mouth.
We're focusing on
what we have now,
because
the demand's been huge.
Ahh, I know just how to
put some hair on that head.
[ Laughter ]
So you were just saying that
demand's been huge. By who?
So, when we launched
the kickstarter,
honestly, we were just
validating through the process,
Alexander: It is a dream come
true, honestly. It really was.
We've watched this show
for years
and never thought I'd actually
be up here making a deal
and making my own
American dream come true.
Narrator: Next up
is a company dedicated to
making interesting products
for our animal friends.
