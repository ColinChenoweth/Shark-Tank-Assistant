for beers
are the ultimate craft-beer fan.
Let's shoot that guy.
No, I like that one.
Oh, Robert.
You can have mine.
-O'Leary: That is disgusting.
-I like the vanilla one a lot.
So if I tell all
my followers on social media
to put in sardines
and chocolate chips,
and it gets voted to the top,
you'll make it?
So, there's a caveat to that.
To vote, you have to back it up
with your dollars.
It is a pre-order
of that beer.
Okay. How many do you
have to pre-order?
It's a $25 pre-order
for four 22-ounce bombers.
Walk us through an example.
I want to get a beer made
with whatever Mark said.
What'd you say, Mark?
Um, sardines
and chocolate chips.
So I want to get that made.
I go online.
I put up $25 for sardines
and chocolate-chip beer.
-Yep..
-[ Laughs ]
You make it, because a lot of
other people love the idea.
Where do I go get it?
We work with online
liquor stores
to ship it
straight to your door.
How do they vote?
They vote
on the MobCraft website,
and they vote by saying,
"If this beer wins,
I'm putting a pre-authorization
on my card.
If it doesn't win,
no charge goes through.
Okay, so let's go through
the economics now.
Um, when we started
the company in 2013,
we thought wineries in Wisconsin
can ship straight to consumers.
Breweries probably can,
as well.
We hit a big wall,
and that was not legal.
So it took us about nine months
to get the permitting
straightened out.
So we work with online
liquor stores,
and then we have negotiated
that we sell in volume to them,
and they take
a smaller percentage
than a traditional retailer.
Tell us your numbers.
All said and done, we've sold
about $350,000 worth of beer
and $280,000 of that has been
within the last 12 months.
And what will you do
this year?
This year we will do
just shy of half a million
dollars in revenues.
When -- are you gonna make money
off your 500K this year?
Um, this year, since we're
building out a new facility,
we'll have about a $28,000 loss.
-Wow.
-So I'll back up a little bit.
We launched it out of our
university in Wisconsin,
and we just started homebrewing
batches of beer,
and then we said, "All right,
let's see if this can actually
be commercially viable."
So we bought a brewery --
all the guts of one.
How much money did you raise
to do all this?
All said and done,
the founders put in $33,000.
So then you obviously have
a partner.
Yes. Two partners.
And then we also have
an SBA 504 loan.
How big's the loan?
The -- the loan
was for $150,000,
and that was used to purchase
the guts of that brewery
that we started
using about half of it.
What is your background?
Tell us about you.
You know, I found my first
passion of skateboarding,
and I wanted to go get a job
at the local skateboard store.
And I went, talked to the guy.
He said, "Hey, unfortunately,
we're not doing so hot.
We're gonna shut
the business down."
So I was kind of discouraged,
went back home, and my mom said,
but the turnaround times
is our biggest struggle.
How long is the turnaround?
Right now, we're advertising
30-day turnarounds
on our website.
-Wow.
Okay, but should I pay
five times your cash flow?
Value at $1 million --
is that what you're worth?
I think we are on track
to really scaling this company
and improving our profits
just by simply automating
the back-end system.
Our biggest struggle right now
is our turnaround times.
You know --
Why haven't you automated it
up to this point?
We have 22,000 SKUs
on the website.
-Wow.
-It's the artwork.
-Oh, I hate that.
-That's a huge amount of SKUs.
Why do you have so many?
Well, it's all
the different sizes.
So technically, it's a lot less
when you see the amount
of designs,
but we do all the way
up to 3XL and extra small.
You've put a value on your
business at $3.5 million.
I'm looking at it
as five times cash flow.
You're smart enough to know
that's not an unreasonable --
Kevin doesn't understand that
companies actually do grow.
He just thinks that
they stay the same size.
O'Leary: Well, he's not growing.
I'm a reasonable guy.
What multiple
for a t-shirt company
should I put on
cash flow?
You don't put it on cash flow
at this point.
You want to know
how he's gonna grow.
So you're not
a disciplined investor.
You will make foolish decisions.
[ Chuckles ]
The challenge is
what's your angle, right?
Because the thing that concerns
me is you based it on hype.
-Yeah.
-Right?
For you to grow to get to
$5 million, $10 million.
How are you gonna do it?
So, I do have plans to get into
mass distribution.
You want to go into retail?
-Uh, very selectively.
-Oof.
I want to be selective about the
retailers that carry our brand.
What are you gonna
use the money for?
So your margins are really
gonna change, though,
you know,
if you go into retail.
Like, right now,
you said you're making...
-60% margins.
-60%.
But you're gonna have to
wholesale them.
We -- we simply can't
go into mass distribution
with our on-demand
business model.
So part of the reason I'm here
for a partnership with a shark
is to secure additional
manufacturing relationships
where we can do these
high-volume runs.
What are you --
what are you gonna use the --
the --
the $175,000 for?
So primarily,
because I know
we're good at
direct-to-consumer --
that's something
I'm confident in --
I do want to improve
our conversion rate
by speeding up
those turnarounds.
How many do you convert?
So we are at a 1% conversion
right now, which is low.
Just 1%?
That's horrible, yeah.
They see
our 30-day turnaround,
and I-I know that's
what's scaring people away.
at this point in time,
so I'm out.
Okay.
I just look at it from, uh,
the discipline of a financial
investor and say to myself
you're not worth more than
five times cash flow.
You're worth $1 million.
You're asking for $3.5 million.
I think that's ridiculous.
I valued this company at
one and a half times revenue
and feel it was pretty fair,
but I am willing to negotiate.
Would you agree to 15%?
Hmm.
-Don't do it.
-There's a --
-Close to Kevin's 17%.
-17.5% is fair.
22.5%.
That's just too much equity
for that amount of money.
I have to do a lot of work.
-Okay.
-And you're gonna need --
You're gonna need to
turn around these goods
way, way quicker, so I'm gonna
have to stick with the 22.5%.
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.
-Thank you.
-Uh-huh. Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
Thanks for the shirt.
Guess we can't show this.
[ All sigh ]
Bye bye,
pizza guy with beard.
Well, all is not lost.
-These are really attractive.
-[ Chuckles ]
Oh, here.
Put my shirt on with them.
That's just amazing.
Yeah, that's who you want
to go to bed with.
[ Laughs ]
That's a really confusing
outfit.
[ Laughter ]
Narrator: Next up is a product
that helps light the way.
Sharks, it's time to explain
the toilet in the room.
Each night,
millions of people
awake to the call of
mother nature.
They stumble out of bed,
into the bathroom,
and they're faced with a
terrible choice --
turn on blinding lights
and wake themselves up
or go it alone
in the dark.
Neither is a good option.
So don't make that choice.
Get IllumiBowl.
[ Herjavec chuckles ]
The IllumiBowl is a way
to do your business
in a whole new light.
IllumiBowl
is a motion-activated,
toilet-bowl night-light.
It easily attaches to
the edge of any bowl
and automatically
turns itself on
anytime you enter the room
at night.
So what that means is
there's no more blinding lights,
just a soft glow
where you need to go.
It's simple, small,
and clean.
Its modern design and
state-of-the-art manufacturing
means it'll light up your
bathroom for years and years.
At IllumiBowl, our main
priorities are -- number one...
and number two.
[ Laughter ]
So, sharks...
So don't let this opportunity
go to waste.
We'll get you
some samples.
Yeah, so it's on --
it's on a two-minute timer.
And so
if you're longer than that,
it just sees motion,
and it turns back on again.
-So when the m-- Okay.
-So you have to move.
How close do you have to be
to it for it to motion-activate?
It depends on the bathroom,
actually.
It'll turn on some bathrooms
right at the door,
some you have to be within
two -- two, three feet of it.
so when I wanted to know if it
was a legitimate idea or not --
so we did it on kickstarter
and we --
we figured all we needed
to get started
for all the tooling and molding
was 20 grand.
And we did no --
it was all organic.
We didn't pay for advertising,
for marketing, for anything.
It went to 100 grand,
and then we've just had
a lot of distributors
started reaching out to us.
-So you need cash for inventory.
-That's the inventory.
And this is the unit
you're gonna sell,
and then somebody's gonna
knock it off if it sells a lot.
-They'll just change something.
-It's a first-to-market game.
Why do you need cash inventory
if you have --
-you have $100,000 now, correct?
-Yeah, so we have to fulfill --
And you got the money up front
from kickstarter.
And $4 per unit, right?
So 1,000 units -- $4,000. Right?
So you can have -- On a bad day,
you can have 10,000 units.
Mm-hmm. So yeah,
we're shipping in 10,000 units,
6,500 already spoken for.
So that only leaves 3,000 units
to deal with.
Sure.
So that's not gonna
last very long.
But I mean, that's --
that's -- that's the beauty of,
and that's what
most entrepreneurs
have in common
that are successful.
They take affordable next steps.
You don't need us.
Take affordable next steps.
I'm out.
It is patent pending, so it's a
first-to-market game, honestly.
We can
grow slower organically,
and we still will
if we have to, but --
'cause we have turned down
investors to this point.
-What's your competition,
though?
-It's two guys
and a toilet-bowl light,
basically, right?
-Yeah.
-Okay, look. I like it.
It's kind of nuts.
I'll give you 100 grand for 25%.
Guys, I-I see this
as novelty item.
Doesn't mean you can't
make money off of it.
Congratulations.
You guys thought it through
and your sweat equity is turning
into a real business for you,
but it's a product,
it's not a company.
-Sure.
-And for that reason, I'm out.
-Thank you, Mark.
-You're welcome.
Um, so yeah, absolutely.
So when we --
and respond to you, too.
Well, I wouldn't -- listen.
I wouldn't sit on the bowl
too long.
-[ Chuckles ]
-I'd -- I'd, uh --
-Do you see this for women?
-I'll be very honest, guys.
Did you do
any market research?
You know, a lot of our buyers
are women, actually.
They want to use it
for potty training
-their kids and their husbands.
-Yeah, clever.
We got a lot of wives
and mothers
to use it to help their kids,
'cause their kids are scared
to go to the bathroom
in the dark
alone at night.
Mike, I -- look.
I-I think
you're gonna run fast.
You did $100,000 in sales.
You can buy more inventory.
I won't make you a better offer
than Kevin's made you.
Frankly, I think you need
a brand to this.
You need a face
that people associate with
-toilet paper and toilets.
-[ Laughs ]
-[ Laughs ]
-And I think, you know...
You got the best offer
when it comes to that.
...you think flushing away
stuff, Kevin's your guy.
-Okay.
-I'm out.
-Oh.
-So Kevin, would you --
That is an incredible offer.
So it did --
It was a lot of work
to get here,
and we do see
how this can scale.
Would you be willing to meet
in the middle with that?
No. This is a light
for a toilet bowl.
-Let's be realistic.
-Sure.
Greiner: Well, I want to share
with you something, too.
-Sure.
-You know, I did a deal with
a product called
Squatty Potty.
Mm-hmm.
Seen it.
And they have done
almost $8 million in six months.
-Wow.
-But one of the things
that they're doing
is a lot of extensions.
-Mm-hmm.
-One has illumination,
and I would not want
to be competitive...
-Conflict of interest.
-...with anything that
you're doing or to do something
that steps on
what they're doing.
-I'm out.
-Thank you, Lori.
So,
you have an offer from Kevin.
It's $100,000 for 25%.
What do you think?
Hello, sharks.
I'm Victoria Coopman.
And I'm Tim Taft.
And we're the owners of
Innovation Pet.
We're seeking $250,000
for 5% interest in our company.
-Oh. Oh, that hurts.
-$250,000 for 5%?
Whether you're a dog lover
or a crazy cat lady,
people love their pets.
It's no secret
that having a pet
changes your life
for the better,
so why not
make their lives better?
That's why Victoria and I
started Innovation Pet.
We manufacture all kinds
of pet products --
dog toys, dog houses,
cat play systems,
and yes, even our magical
chicken coops.
Innovation Pet
has just begun to make its mark
as leaders in innovation,
so which one of you sharks
want to
paw, scratch, or peck
your way in and join our team?
-[ Laughs ]
-Can we see a demo?
Yes, absolutely.
Why don't we start with
the magical Kitty Connection.
So this has, by far,
been one of our most popular
product launches.
If you have a cat at home,
you know
that cats get very bored.
They need to have motion.
They need to have something.
The best-selling categories
in cat toys
are cat toys, scratching items,
and cat furniture.
The Kitty Connection
is all three of those.
It's got
scratching components --
corrugate and carpet.
Then you can build it up.
It's modular, so you can
constantly create a new toy.
Change it up.
And the biggest feature
on this --
we have an internal pulley
system,
so when the cat
plays with one toy,
it moves
another one on there,
so it creates its own motion
on there.
That's the Kitty Connection.
-Dog houses --
-The dog house is very cool.
Yeah, it's -- Robert,
if you know, dog houses, today,
are real boxy.
There's really not a lot of
fashion or trends in them.
Oh, I know a lot about
being in the dog house.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Well, you'd want to be
in this one. This one's cute.
This has, by far, been
our most popular launch.
We call it
the Whimsical Dog House.
And, by the way,
we have 10 products
in the Innovation pipeline
that we're working on right now.
-Coming out?
-Is there any you can share?
We're creating --
And this is just a prototype.
We're gonna call it
the Magic Carpet,
and it's gonna
have toys hanging off it
so that you can
have the cat chase it.
It'll be a carpeted
scratching surface on top
so they can lay on top of it,
and they love riding it around.
And then you
remote-control operate it?
And we're also working on
something you can use
on your phone.
So would I
drive the cat around?
Yep.
The cat jumps on,
scratches, plays with the toys,
jumps off.
Tell us about
the chicken thing.
The chicken coops -- this is
a magical category for us.
All the coops out there
on the market today
-only have one little door.
-Hey.
So one of the different things
about our coops
is we have a patent pending,
free-range door on ours.
Can you open it
so we can see it?
Yeah, yeah.
So we basically --
It has two latches,
and the whole front of the coop
lifts up and opens.
The lower portion, so that
they're able to go in and out
and come back during the day
when they want food and water.
So, I just purchased six chicken
coops for my Guinea hens.
-[ Laughs ]
-I did.
Wow.
And they can be expensive,
actually.
I would say that one is,
fully assembled, $700.
No way.
Way more than that.
This one is gonna retail
for about $599.
-That's --
-That's it?
Good chicken coop.
Great price.
So then it's a better price
than what he paid.
Daymond,
if you have chickens,
you'll know that, um,
8 out of 10 people
who have backyard flocks --
they let them out to
run around the yard, so if --
when you're free-ranging
your birds,
at the end of the night,
you want to get them back in
to really keep them safe from
predators, coyotes, raccoons.
So they'll coop them
at the end of the night.
Well, I don't know when
we're gonna get to this...
[ Laughter ]
...but you've put a value of
$5 million on this business.
Um, yeah.
This year, um, we're --
We're gonna hit
$2.5 million in sales.
Wow.
So tell us
how you're getting that.
Is this online?
Through retail?
Do the big boxes
play with you guys?
Yes. Yes, basically,
to all those questions.
Um, so today our customer-base
is pet specialty --
number one -- mainly
with the Kitty Connection.
-So this is not big box?
-No, there is big box.
Well, like, PetCo,
things like that.
PetCo and PetSmart.
So do you sell in large animal
and pet-oriented stores?
Yes. In fact, the
Kitty Connection's in PetCo.
You have a lot
of different products.
Just give me
the average margin of sales.
We're at 27% gross margins.
That's not so good.
Um,
it depends on the category.
So a lot of our dollars,
and some of the coops
aren't as high-margin,
and some of the smaller items
are higher margin.
Victoria, what would your margin
be if you didn't have the coops?
-Above 40%.
-Yeah.
-Above 40%.
-Ohh.
They are driving dollars
that we don't make a lot on,
but we don't touch them.
There's very little
logistical cost.
Right, so you're turning --
It's basically found money
-because it's
drop-shipped there.
-Yep.
I think
the design is beautiful.
You guys obviously know
what you're doing.
$250,000 for 5% --
it's so small.
A lot of inventory,
a lot of churn.
You're gonna need
way more capital.
I don't know how I would get in
at a significant equity today,
because I think you've actually
maybe valued it fairly,
and I just see so much more
coming down the road.
I can't help you
with distribution.
You're already there.
I'm out.
Tim and Victoria's pet product
company Innovation Pet.
So the question is,
for any investor,
is how do I get my money back?
Do we take the chicken coop
public at some point?
[ Chuckles ]
Or does it get acquired
by somebody else?
Or do you pay it off?
I mean, I-I'd do this deal
with you --
I'd give you the $250,000.
I'd like to double my money.
So I'd like you to pay me
a 6% royalty on sales
until I get $500,000 back,
and I'll take the 5% equity now,
because I'm your banker now.
And so I'm incentivized for you
to get me back as fast as I can.
I don't have a time limit on it.
What I'd try and do is
accelerate sales.
-So $250,000, 6% --
-It's venture debt.
So that means
it's gonna take me,
depending what you do in sales,
three and a half years
to get it back.
At least you get a deal...
unless Daymond wants to step up
and, uh, he loves chickens.
We know
this is your space.
John:
Yeah. You know, the 5%.
What wiggle room do you have?
Are you -- are you willing
to kind of move that around?
-Yeah.
-I-I-If -- if --
If we can get
the PO financing.
I want to take that financing
challenge off your plate.
I understand that's
the biggest hurdle you have.
I will give you the $250,000,
and my intent is to go out,
license or strategic
relationship,
whatever the case is.
I will give you that
for 12.5% of the company,
but 25% of online.
Because
I'll build online for you.
-That's expensive.
-So Daymond,
you're gonna give them $250,000
for 12.5% equity right away,
plus you want
25% of the profit...
-Of online.
-...of any online sales.
And I will build the online.
And right now you don't have
a lot of online,
so he's gonna
build it for you.
So it's newfound money.
I'm trying to find
newfound money for you,
and I've already
consulted with Darnell.
-[ Laughs ]
-Darnell been here for me.
-Aw.
-He's told me
what we need to do.
You guys want to
step out and talk?
A lot of discussion
going on here.
[ Laughs ]
They're laughing at you,
Kevin.
It's okay.
Daymond, did you say you'd help
us PO finance as well?
Yes. Of course. I'm gonna take
that off the -- off the plate.
Kevin, we're very flattered
by your offer,
um, just because strategically
we feel that
Daymond could also be
a good fit in the company.
Absolutely,
he is a chicken.
And Daymond,
you have a deal.
All right.
Darnell, you hear that, baby?
[ Laughs ]
All right.
Thank you, man.
Appreciate it.
-Thanks.
-Thank you.
I am so excited.
Cuban: Congrats, guys.
We did it, man.
I am so excited.
-Yeah.
-That was so great.
Having Daymond
as a strategic partner for us
is gonna be phenomenal.
Our online business,
we anticipate's
going to probably
quadruple overnight.
Yeah.
So we're very excited
about that,
and it's going to be able to get
our product out to more people,
and that's our goal.
-Right. Right.
-That's our goal.
