Hello, Sharks.
I'm Mike.
Mikey here is the C.E.O.,
but I'm the C.R.I.C. --
Chief Redneck in Charge.

O'Leary:
Ozzy, there are solutions that
stay frozen longer than water.
Yes, sir, there are.
Is this one of them?
Yes.
Yes.
Did you patent this shape?
Uh, we have two patents pending.
We have a design patent
Hey, Ozzy,
where were you on TV?
It says "as seen on TV."
We just did that
for here.
[ Laughter ]
We -- We -- We wanted
to make it look good.
I wish I had
a better answer for you,
but we were drinking
when we came up with that.
[ Laughter ]
Have you approached
any beer companies
about putting their logo
on this?
Great promotional idea.
What does Ozzy do?
I am the director
of quality food safety
Ozzy, I'm not sure you need
to step down.
I-I mean,
you guys did a great job,
Lori's giving you exactly
what you're looking for, Ozzy.
No, we-- we're --
we're flattered,
but my partner here has
a serious man crush on Mark
'cause they're both
from Pittsburgh.
Who doesn't, you know?
We've selected Cuban, but
he's got to have a beer with us.
Done!
[ Laughter ]
Sorry, Lori.
I -- How do I compete
with a man crush?
Thank you.
Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Amen, brother.
Cheers.
Thanks to Mark Cuban,
my partner Mikey Robb...
