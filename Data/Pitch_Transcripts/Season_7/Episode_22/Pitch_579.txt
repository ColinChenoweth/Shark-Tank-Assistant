I'm Ozzy.
And I'm Mike.
And we're from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
I'm an attorney,
and I fight for victims
who have contracted lung cancer
and mesothelioma.
And I'm an executive
in the food business,
monitoring our quality
in food safety.
We can do that.
We've come up
with one of the coolest products
that's ever been invented.
That is brilliant.
And we think it's gonna
change lives.
Hit it, son! Whoo!
Every year at Memorial Day,
we go to my hunting cabin
just to get away from things
and clear our mind.
It was on
one of these getaways
where we started brainstorming
our business idea.
Before we knew it,
we had come up with the solution
to a problem that had been
plaguing us for years.
It's perfect.
We didn't know how
we'd lived without it,
and we thought
it was our obligation
to share it
with the world.
The reason we want
to get a deal with a Shark
is they have contacts that
we couldn't dream of having.
We need a Shark to get
our product to the masses.
Cheers, my friend.
This isn't just about us.
It's about America and
making people's lives better.
We're hoping to stay cool
under pressure if we can
and land a deal
with a Shark.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Mike.
And I'm Ozzy.
And together,
we run the Beer Blizzard company
based in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
What?!
[ Greiner and Cuban chuckle ]
Sharks, we're here
for a $100,000 investment
for a 20% equity stake
in our company.
Mikey here is the C.E.O.,
but I'm the C.R.I.C. --
Chief Redneck in Charge.
[ Chuckles ]
And being
the Chief Redneck in Charge
makes me an expert
in two categories -- fashion...
[ Greiner laughs ]
...and beer.
And I'm gonna tell
you Sharks something --
warm beer sucks.
Sharks, beer tastes great,
but it's got to be ice-cold.
You know that.
But the problem with beer is
once you get down
to around here,
that ice-cold beer,
it ain't so ice-cold anymore.
Something
had to be done.
And you know what, Sharks?
We did do something.
When Ozzy and I noticed
that all aluminum cans have
the exact same
dome-shaped bottom,
we had an "aha" moment
and came up with a great idea
that we are sure is the cure
for warm beer.
Introducing...
Together:
The Beer Blizzard.
It's a reusable plastic
dome-shaped ice cube
designed to fit
the concave bottom
of all aluminum beer
and soda cans on the market.
The Beer Blizzard is
really simple to use.
All you do is freeze it and
insert here for ice-cold beer.
[ Sighs ]
Ahh.
[ Chuckles ]
Ahh! America,
you are welcome!
[ Laughter ]
Sharks, Ozzy and I have
been in business
for just over a year now,
and ever since we launched
our company on Kickstarter,
we've had
a ton of success.
Hangovers.
[ Chuckles ]
Now, we know
you Sharks love money,
but the world loves beer.
Ice-cold beer.
So, the question is
how many of you Sharks
want to line up with us
and help make the Beer Blizzard
the second greatest invention
in the history of mankind?
What was the first?
All: Beer.
Now, we're gonna
offer you Sharks
an ice-cold beer
and a Beer Blizzard
for you to look at
before the Q&amp;A begins.
Robert.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Cheers, Lori.
Hopefully it's your brand.
Greiner:
I have a question.
Have you ever done testing?
How long would it
keep your beer cold?
Mikey and I had the product
C.A.B.-certified
by an independent accredited
third party laboratory
in Atlanta, Georgia.
Basically, what it says is that
on a warm day outside,
if you open your beer can,
you've got about six minutes
to consume it
before the
"warm beer suck zone."
Yeah.
Now, by using
the Beer Blizzard disc,
you now have 21 minutes
to consume your beverage
under those
same conditions
before the temperature
of that beer --
Greiner:
So, in 21 minutes --
It stays cold for 21 minutes
with or without an insulator?
With the insulator.
With the insulator.
So, all testing was done
with the insulator.
Correct.
You could use
any one of these, right?
That's correct.
Every can insulator is designed
to that specification.
What happens
when you test it
with just an insulator
and no Beer Blizzard?
And no Beer Blizzard?
Oh, we didn't test it
with just the --
We didn't do that.
Cuban:
Can we see the packaging?
We haven't really seen
the packaging.
O'Leary:
Ozzy, there are solutions that
stay frozen longer than water.
Yes, sir, there are.
Is this one of them?
Yes.
Yes.
Did you patent this shape?
Uh, we have two patents pending.
We have a design patent
and a provisional utility patent
that's pending right now.
Hey, guys, does it work
with soft drinks?
Absolutely.
Sure.
'Cause aluminum cans all have
the same shape.
What?
So, you know,
you named it Beer Blizzard,
but it could be
so much wider range to sodas
and anything
that's in a can, right?
Correct.
So, did you ever think
about that?
Like, that this -- this makes it
seem like it's just for beer?
Yeah, I mean, when you look
at that, Lori, I agree with you.
It limits it --
limits it just to beer.
But honestly, Ozzy and I, we've
talked about this many times.
But to be frank with you,
there hasn't been many times
I've been
walking around Pittsburgh,
and I saw
somebody with, like,
a can insulator with a Coke
in it, you know?
It's --
You know, it's beer.
This product is for beer.
We're beer drinkers.
We love sports and beer,
and that's what we do.
Good point.
And I think that's our market.
I think that's --
A good point.
I think it's a mistake
to focus on --
Yeah, I-I honestly
don't really know.
Great answer.
On your website,
does anybody write reviews
or say anything
about it?
No, we get a lot of e-mails,
and a lot of people --
We -- This is how we know
people love it,
because when --
when we get an order,
I e-mail
every single person.
I say,
"Thank you for your order.
How did you hear
about us?"
Good for you.
And they always hear about us
one or two ways --
"I saw your ad
on Facebook,"
which is, "If you hate warm
beer, click here," or I was --
[ Laughs ]
Clever.
Or "I was at a party and my
buddy had one, and I want some."
Herjavec: How much did you raise
on Kickstarter?
Our Kickstarter campaign
was awesome.
Uh, we raised $43,000
in 45 days.,
We hit our goal
in just three days.
Wow.
And we had sales
to all 50 states
and 45 countries
around the world.
And what are your sales
a year later?
A year later,
we sold 66,000 discs.
We sell them in six-packs,
so that's 11,000 six-packs.
The gross was $156,000,
and the net is $135,000.
I'm assuming all online.
Uh, majority of it
is online.
Oh, I love it!
Hey, Ozzy,
where were you on TV?
It says "as seen on TV."
We just did that
for here.
[ Laughter ]
We -- We -- We wanted
to make it look good.
I wish I had
a better answer for you,
but we were drinking
when we came up with that.
[ Laughter ]
Have you approached
any beer companies
about putting their logo
on this?
Great promotional idea.
Yeah, we've made calls,
and they don't return our calls.
[ Speaking indistinctly ]
All: Ohh.
What?!
They will now.
What are you gonna use
the money for?
We want to buy in volume
to get our costs lower per unit.
By building up
our inventory,
increasing our profit margin
for each one,
we want to hire
a full-time fulfillment center
that could handle the orders,
handle the shipments.
Frankly, we're worried
if we're on here,
we're gonna get pounded
with orders.
I'm -- I'm scared
about it, honestly.
What is your, um, full-time job?
Or is this it?
Uh, no. I'm, uh,
I'm an attorney in Pittsburgh.
I represent, um --
Oh, you just blew it.
[ Laughs ]
Ah, I'm sorry.
But It's true.
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew it.
What kind of law?
Um, I represent,
uh, the hardest-working people
in America, people that get sick
from breathing asbestos,
factory workers --
Robert, like your dad --
uh, steel workers --
Mark, like all those guys
around there that, you know,
they bust their ass day in
and day out.
What does Ozzy do?
I am the director
of quality food safety
and regulatory affairs
for one of the nation's
leading food companies.
Who's gonna
run the business, though?
I mean, 'cause you --
you guys have both real jobs.
If we can scale this up
the way we want to,
I made my mark
on the food industry,
and it's time for me
to step down
and run our business.
Ozzy, I'm not sure you need
to step down.
I-I mean,
you guys did a great job,
and, I mean,
I love how you presented it.
But I really think
it's a one-shot product.
I really see it
as a promotional giveaway.
I don't see it
as something
you're gonna build
a business around.
Not for me. I'm out.
Hey, Robert,
we appreciate your advice.
We'll drink a beer with you
anytime. No hard feelings.
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
John:
Uh, I like the product.
I just don't know the
clear direction to go with it.
Even though you're gonna
make this a full-time job,
it's not right now,
and I don't know
if I have the time and energy
to make all those calls.
I'm gonna have to pass
on this one. I'm out.
We're hard-working guys.
We're smart and dedicated.
When we need to get
something done, we get it done.
My clients --
I love my guys,
and I go up against the biggest
companies in the world
that you can imagine.
And when my guy walks into work
in the factory for 45 years,
and he's dying
from mesothelioma,
they're gonna try
and beat him up left and right.
I stick up for him,
and I bust my ass to make sure
that nothing happens
to that guy.
I will do the same thing
for your money,
and we'll do the same thing
for this business.
If you give us a shot,
I guarantee it will turn around.
But I'm just worried that,
you know, it's a product.
It's not really
a company, right?
Correct.
Cuban: Look, I like this,
and I like you.
Not every business has to be
$10 million in sales.
You guys do half a million
dollars in sales at 70% margins.
We'll all make money,
we'll all drink beer,
and we'll all have
a good time.
So, I'm gonna
make you an offer.
100k, but I want 25%,
'cause I have to negotiate.
Done?
But wait. There's more.
Oh, but wait.
I'm interested.
Slow down.
What if I did 100k
for 20%?
I don't think this is
just a promotional product.
I think this is
a great Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
Target,
all types of retail.
You got to decide.
Give us, uh, one second?
Uh...
Are you really
taking that time?
You drank
too much beer.
Yeah, are you taking
that time?
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
Lori's giving you exactly
what you're looking for, Ozzy.
No, we-- we're --
we're flattered,
but my partner here has
a serious man crush on Mark
'cause they're both
from Pittsburgh.
Who doesn't, you know?
We've selected Cuban, but
he's got to have a beer with us.
Done!
[ Laughter ]
Sorry, Lori.
I -- How do I compete
with a man crush?
Thank you.
Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Amen, brother.
Cheers.
We're gonna go home and do
some research and development!
[ Laughter ]
Yeah!
Yes.
I love you, bro.
I love him, too, man.
I'm heartbroken, Mark.
They have a bigger crush
on you.
Ohhh!
Oh!
Thanks to Mark Cuban,
my partner Mikey Robb...
[ Chuckles ]
...and "Shark Tank,"
America, you will now
have cold beer
from the first sip...
Together: To the last.
You are welcome!
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a modern version
of a traditional machine.
