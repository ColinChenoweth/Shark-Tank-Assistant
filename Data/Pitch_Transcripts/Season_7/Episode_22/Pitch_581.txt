Hi. I'm Karen Posada
from Austin, Texas.
My company, The Good Promise, is
seeking $100,000 for 20% equity.
Now, I'm gonna do things
a little differently.
Think of it as a wine tasting,
but without the hangover.
First, I'm gonna
pass out samples
of my delicious
vegetable smoothie blends,
[ Posada laughs ]
So, you can each grab one.
The entire tray?
Yes.
Let me give Lori hers.
She has a hard time.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Karen.
Hold out your pinky.
Any order you'd like us
to try these in?
Posada:
That is our Veggie Burst.
Each one
of our smoothie squeezes
has two servings
of veggies.
We added some zucchini,
celery, spinach.
I like this.
That one is
our Green Bloody Mary.
Can't get the kids
to eat any greens?
Have them try one of
our hidden veggie pasta sauces,
where you can sneak in
some extra goodness
without compromising
the taste.
So, which one of you is ready
to join me in my crusade
as we positively
encourage Americans
to eat more veggies
on the go?
Karen, do I buy it like that
in the plastic?
Yes, you buy it
like that.
Can I see
one of those?
Of course.
Karen, you know,
I have a very advanced palate.
Yes.
People know me
as a wine lover.
I've tried all of them,
as you suggested.
Ohh, my God.
Three out of four
taste like industrial waste.
Oh, come on.
This tastes like soap.
[ Coughs ]
I mean, is there
a lot of vegetables?
This one is so strong.
It's almost hard to drink.
I figured these were meant
to be mixed with something.
Yeah.
Well, I gave you two of them
that are meant to be mixed.
I gave you the Tomatillo,
the Green Bloody Mary.
John:
I have acid reflux.
Okay.
I'm -- I'm over here
burping like a choo-choo train
right now.
Is it --
Is this for a cleanse?
Because I'm hoping
that my burping
Karen, I can't do it.
I just tasted it again.
I'm sorry.
I got to be out.
That's okay.
I'm out.
I don't think that --
that having a bad taste...
Mm-hmm.
...is bad.
This is good for you,
so maybe that's --
that's a marketing angle.
But the challenge with this is,
in the cold-pressed market,
people choose
very particular products.
People that generally like
this area,
which I'm one of them...
Mm-hmm.
...they like to choose
their blends.
Right.
Um, I just don't think that this
one is for me, so I'm out.
Okay. I respect that,
Karen, let -- let me take a stab
at this, okay?
I want to tell you a story
that's very important.
Oh, gosh. Yes.
