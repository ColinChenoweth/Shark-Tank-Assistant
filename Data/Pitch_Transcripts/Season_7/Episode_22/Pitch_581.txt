Hi. I'm Karen Posada
from Austin, Texas.
My company, The Good Promise, is
seeking $100,000 for 20% equity.
Now, I'm gonna do things
a little differently.
Think of it as a wine tasting,
but without the hangover.
First, I'm gonna
pass out samples
of my delicious
vegetable smoothie blends,
and I want you
to please taste them
like you would
a full-bodied glass of red wine.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, we've come
to the right place.
[ Posada laughs ]
So, you can each grab one.
The entire tray?
Yes.
Let me give Lori hers.
She has a hard time.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Karen.
Hold out your pinky.
Any order you'd like us
to try these in?
No. They're all delicious.
Just go ahead and try them.
Okay. Lori, you --
you want to hold it
so you don't heat
the liquid.
[ Cuban chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]
Put the finger out.
That's it.
Okay.
Roll the blends
on the tongue,
and please tell me what flavors
you're able to identify.
Oh! This one's
really good.
That's a little ginger
in that.
Ohh!
Cuban:
Yeah, that's ginger.
What's this one?
Posada:
That is our Veggie Burst.
Each one
of our smoothie squeezes
has two servings
of veggies.
We added some zucchini,
celery, spinach.
I like this.
That one is
our Green Bloody Mary.
Can't get the kids
to eat any greens?
Have them try one of
our hidden veggie pasta sauces,
where you can sneak in
some extra goodness
without compromising
the taste.
So, which one of you is ready
to join me in my crusade
as we positively
encourage Americans
to eat more veggies
on the go?
Karen, do I buy it like that
in the plastic?
Yes, you buy it
like that.
Can I see
one of those?
Of course.
So, I buy it like this,
and I just drink it.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It's not a sauce.
Nope.
Karen, you know,
I have a very advanced palate.
Yes.
People know me
as a wine lover.
I've tried all of them,
as you suggested.
Ohh, my God.
Three out of four
taste like industrial waste.
Oh, come on.
This tastes like soap.
[ Coughs ]
I mean, is there
a lot of vegetables?
This one is so strong.
It's almost hard to drink.
I figured these were meant
to be mixed with something.
Yeah.
Well, I gave you two of them
that are meant to be mixed.
I gave you the Tomatillo,
the Green Bloody Mary.
John:
I have acid reflux.
Okay.
I'm -- I'm over here
burping like a choo-choo train
right now.
Is it --
Is this for a cleanse?
Because I'm hoping
that my burping
doesn't move down south,
and I have to cut this --
No, it is not
for a cleanse.
[ Laughs ]
That is way too much
information.
Well, we're about
to cut this pitch short
in a minute.
Hold on.
[ Laughter ]
No, it is not supposed to
be a cleanse.
Way too much.
[ Speaks indistinctly ]
Well, it's cleansing
right now.
O'Leary: Cleanse or no cleanse,
when do we know --
It's cleans-- It's in the middle
of cleansing right now.
So, how many have you sold?
Maybe we're wrong.
Maybe we're wrong.
Okay, so, let me go back.
So, our first product to market
was our line of pasta sauces,
and we've sold $260,000
in 18 months.
On pasta sauces?
Not these?
Yeah.
How much of these
have you sold?
We just launched those,
so our first --
our biggest customer
is Walmart Supercenters.
But you're doing
a great job,
so why move from pasta sauces to these?
Good for you. That's good.
Well, we've had
several challenges
with our pasta sauces.
First, the retail price
is $4.99,
which proved to be
really expensive.
I'm not making enough money
with the pasta sauces.
Our markup was 23%.
Oh.
And we're not turning them
fast enough to see any capital.
So, you're selling,
but you're not making money.
Exactly.
I'm just interested --
When will these get on the shelf
so that someone can buy it,
try it,
come back,
and buy it again?
October.
These will sell for $1.99,
so we're gonna be cheaper
than the competition.
And how much is your margin
gonna be on these?
40%.
I have to be honest here.
I did not love them.
I found them a little hard
to drink.
And I think
maybe it'd be a good idea
to keep formulating
a little bit.
[ Laughter ]
Lori, but no, and I understand
where you're coming from,
but we've done -- I mean,
we tasted it with 2,000 people,
and the Veggie Burst was
one of the favorites.
Really?
Listen, you know what?
Everybody's palates
are different.
Yeah, and I --
And I truly am not trying
to put this down.
No, and that's okay.
But I definitely need
to be out on this deal.
Okay, I understand.
Herjavec:
I'll give you this credit.
We see a lot of people
on the show,
and they talk about trying
to get distribution,
and you've gotten distribution
in Walmart.
Yeah.
Cuban: Have you
raised money to do this?
I have raised money.
Um, my mom has invested
$100,000.
Ouch.
And I've raised $75,000
from angel investors.
Wow.
So, this product,
we're selling it at a price
that is so competitive.
But you're not selling it.
You haven't sold it yet.
Well, but -- Well, the price
will be at $1.99,
and there is a need
for vegetable-based products
that are convenient, that are
portable, that are affordable.
I'm just worried if somebody
actually drank the whole thing,
they'd have the dance
of the flaming sphincter.
[ Laughs ]
This thing is brutal.
Karen, I can't do it.
I just tasted it again.
I'm sorry.
I got to be out.
That's okay.
I'm out.
I don't think that --
that having a bad taste...
Mm-hmm.
...is bad.
This is good for you,
so maybe that's --
that's a marketing angle.
But the challenge with this is,
in the cold-pressed market,
people choose
very particular products.
People that generally like
this area,
which I'm one of them...
Mm-hmm.
...they like to choose
their blends.
Right.
Um, I just don't think that this
one is for me, so I'm out.
Okay. I respect that,
and so thank you so much
for saying that.
Karen, let -- let me take a stab
at this, okay?
I want to tell you a story
that's very important.
Oh, gosh. Yes.
You can't take a snail
and just eat it.
You have to purge the toxins
from its intestinal tract.
I know that when I cook it,
it won't poison me.
It has no toxins left in it.
[ Chuckles ]
This stuff tastes like a snail
that hasn't been purged.
So, make your offer,
then, Kevin.
There is no offer.
I'm out.
Yeah. Okay.
I understand that.
Thank you so much.
So, Mark, going back to where
my focus is at.
So, we're coming out with
our pre-workout, post-workout,
um, blends, as well,
and we're gonna --
we're gonna have
our veggie shots.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there, right?
Yeah.
You are taking on
a lot of battles.
You have to pick --
Well, it's just flavors,
right, Mark?
But it's not
just flavors...
Different product.
...because it's how
you position yourself,
it's how you market it,
it's how people define
your brand.
When people are going to
buy this product,
they're gonna make
an instantaneous decision...
Yeah.
It's gonna be a bad one.
...against all
the other brands.
Yes.
If your message
is not crystal clear,
they're not gonna
choose you.
But, Mark,
I mean, it's, like,
you're getting two servings
of veggies per pouch, right?
Someone who's looking
for something healthier,
so I don't understand --
There's a thousand of those
out there.
We're trying to get
other business.
It's not just retail,
and I wanted you to taste --
You're taking on the world
before you've
even started selling.
That's a problem.
I'm out.
Okay.
So, you're all out. Okay.
Well, thank you.
-Thank you.
-Good luck.
-Good luck.
It looks like the Sharks
are veggie haters,
but I'm not gonna
let that discourage me.
I wish the Sharks would have
seen past their own palate
and seen the value
of the company.
I have had
so many more challenges
that we've been able to --
to pivot and make
something great out of them,
so this will just be one more
of those experiences.
