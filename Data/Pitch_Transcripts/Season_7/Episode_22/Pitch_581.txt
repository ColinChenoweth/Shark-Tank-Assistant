Hey, Sharks.
I'm Brian Shimmerlik.
And I'm Steve Bofill.
We're from New York City,
and our company is Vengo.
We are seeking $2 million
for 12.5% of our company.
When you hear "vending machine,"
what comes to mind?
Most people imagine desperately
shaking this old machine,
trying to get that bag
of potato chips to drop out.
These machines are huge,
they're old, they're ugly,
and so they get hidden
in the basement.
Vengo is taking vending
out of the basement
into the spotlight
with the latest technology.
So, what's so different
about Vengo? Everything.
Let's start with size
and appearance.
Our slim-form factor
and attractive design
is the ticket to exclusive,
high-traffic areas.
Vengo hangs on the wall
like a picture frame
and requires
zero floor space.
Let me show you
how it works.
What Vengo does is
we bring video content
to the point of purchase.
Bofill: So, Brian will go ahead
and browse the products.
It looks like the Bottle
Breacher has caught his eye.
He adds it to the cart,
clicks "checkout."
Wait a minute, Brian.
I don't see any slots for coins.
Vengo is totally cashless,
totally digital,
very, very fast.
Once the payment is made,
our team at Vengo
back in New York
is automatically notified
of the sale,
and that's
just scratching the surface
with everything we can do
with the valuable data
from each and every vending
machine out in the field.
It's that easy.
Who's ready to Vengo?
So, it's small in size.
Yes.
Does that mean that anything
that you sell out of it
has to be small in size?
Absolutely.
This is about the largest item
that we can fit,
but we can actually fit
100 products.
How do we fit so much
in so little
is we have an amazing team
of aerospace engineers.
Is he
an aerospace engineer?
Yes, that's
my background.
I was an aerospace engineer
for about 9 or 10 years.
What happened to you?
Uh...
And now you're making
vending machines.
Now I'm making
vending machines.
Exactly.
I saw the opportunity,
I quit my aerospace job,
and I jumped to this.
See what happened
with the space program?
We're not
a vending operator,
and we're not
replacing vending machines,
but we are a software
and media company
that manages this digital
network from the cloud.
So, here's
our business model.
We sell the hardware
to vending companies.
So, let's go from there.
So, let's go from there, right?
So, you're selling to
vending-machine guys and owners.
Exactly.
So, let's go from there.
What does one of those cost
for me to buy
if I'm
a vending machine guy?
Yep.
What does it
cost you to make?
Yeah. You're not gonna
love this, so bear with me.
We build it for $2,500.
We <i>sell</i> it for $2,500.
Boo!
[ Chuckles ]
I understand.
I got it.
Okay, so you charge
a monthly, then.
So, what do you charge
on a monthly, then?
Exactly. We charge you
$20 per Vengo per month.
And what do I get
for that $20?
You get the front-end software
that controls the hardware.
Do I -- Does that include
maintenance in case it breaks?
Exactly. Yep.
We're --
Okay.
So, then do --
do the different companies
that you sell this to
select and choose
what's going to
go in the machine?
We control
the media rights,
and we control a significant
amount of the product mix.
And so, you can get
some of your products in
as the owner
of the hardware,
but we're also managing
this network remotely...
Right.
...working with
really great products
to get them into the Vengos
across the whole network.
What are
your total sales?
For this year, we're going to
generate $1 million.
Wow.
We just partnered
with the largest vending-machine
company in the country.
But, Brian, you make money
from the front of the screen.
You're an ad company.
Plain and simple, right?
Absolutely.
Let me tell you guys
what we're doing here.
Okay.
We are changing the game
on retail
and marketing
physical products.
That's a stretch.
Traffic into stores is down 50%
over the last 3 years.
The impulse purchase
at the checkout
at the grocery store
is down significantly.
Herjavec:
Brian, so, I'm an advertiser.
I want to advertise
on the front of the screen.
How do you charge me?
So, we're charging brands
$200 per SKU
per machine per month.
Wow.
Whoa.
What happens if they don't --
That's -- That's a lot.
Shimmerlik: And what --
And what that gets them is
we actually purchase
the product wholesale.
We sell it at retail.
We make sure
our vending partners can make
an attractive margin
and the product is --
So does it fit --
Guys, guys, look, I get it.
This is a digital end cap.
This is a digital end cap,
right?
Yeah.
Which is great.
But here -- here's my issue.
I invested in a company called
Oasis by women out of Boston.
They go into
women's restrooms
and all the products
are women's.
Now, we've designed
our own box.
I see them as competitive,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Understood.
[ Speaks indistinctly ]
Brian, why don't you
talk about
the $16 million valuation you've
put in front of the Sharks here?
John: Yeah, absolutely.
[ Greiner chuckles ]
Let's jump into that.
$2 million for 12.5%.
I'm gonna make the assumption
it's not supported by cash flow
because you don't have any.
So, there must be
some other reason
you think
you're still valuable.
It must be
that you have --
Have you raised
the money al-- already?
We've raised $3.4 million
from some of
the best investors out there.
The best investors in America
are right here.
You're talking to them.
Exactly.
That's why we're here.
And we always get great pricing.
I make sure of that.
I know you do.
Just explain to me how
it's worth $16 million today.
You might do $1 million in sales
this year.
Yeah.
Will you make any money
on that $1 million?
No, we will not.
We will lose
about $300,000,
uh, and then next year,
we will break even.
And so why is it worth
that much?
We've got an amazing team,
and we've spent three years
building out this platform.
I've partnered --
Let's not forget I've partnered
with the largest vending company
in the country,
and we've partnered
with the nation's largest
chocolate manufacturer, as well
as several other big brands.
It's very smart
to have point of purchase video
if you can have it
in something.
Exactly.
But on here,
do they have to be relative
to what's inside the machine,
or are you selling
advertising space to anything?
We're focused
on the differentiator.
The differentiator
is coupling retail,
point of purchase
with media,
extracting tons of data
about how consumers behave.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Uh, I don't like it.
What I find confusing
about it
is you're in
the advertising business,
and there's a lot of competition
for point of sale advertising,
but you're also
selling product,
but you're only selling products
that are in the machine,
and one day, maybe,
if you get big,
you'll do advertising
for other things, too.
So, is it
a display-advertising company,
or is it a pseudo vending?
This business model is
just too complicated
and unfocused for me.
I'm out.
Guys, can I ask if your balance
sheet has any debt on it?
We have
absolutely no debt.
How would you like some?
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out,
but Kevin may be interested
in Brian and Steven's
high-tech vending machine,
Vengo.
Guys, can I ask if your balance
sheet has any debt on it?
We have
absolutely no debt.
How would you like some?
I'm open to it. I'm open
to hearing what you got.
What about I lend you --
This goes into
my venture debt fund --
I give you $2 million,
and I'll take 6%
of the company in equity,
which is half of you asked.
So, $2 million in debt.
Yeah.
And...
I'll loan the company
a 36-month loan -- 3 years.
Okay.
That's enough
for proof of concept here.
$2 million,
and I want 6% of the equity
for providing
the facility.
Okay.
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.
And there's no interest payments
on the debt
and there's
no strings attached?
Oh, you got to pay interest.
Are you kidding? It's a fund.
It has to make at least 7%
is my lowest rate.
Horrible!
Here is
"Mr. Advice With No Checkbook."
Isn't that wonderful?
I'm the only Shark up here --
No one's written
more checks
or bigger checks
on this show than I have,
and I'm telling you
what you already know.
It's horrible.
I have a venture debt fund.
This is what I do all day long
with tech companies.
So, Mr. Wonderful...
Yes.
...how did you calculate 6%
on the equity side?
I just asked for it.
[ Laughter ]
It's just what he wants.
It's that easy.
I just want to wet my beak
in the equity, and I deserve to.
That's a big, old beak.
I love my beak.
I look at this, and it's
a little confusing for me.
If you're going up
on a wall, right,
you're taking up that space,
so the space below it
now is empty.
I don't see why
you wouldn't lengthen that.
It's a little odd to me
at the moment.
Like, I-I personally feel
it needs some work.
Lori, is it possible,
given our asking for a
significant amount of money...
You are.
...is it possible
that you guys would consider
coming in together?
Have you guys
ever partnered up before?
O'Leary:
I think -- I think I'll bring
you in on that deal, Lori.
I mean, you've raised
a lot of money.
You're asking
for a lot of money.
With $3.4 million,
we've built a network
of 150 machines,
soon to go to 250,
we've partnered with
the largest vending company
in the country.
The vending market is a large,
slow-moving industry.
It's $7 billion.
So, there's a lot of opportunity
here to create retail.
So, if I go in with Kevin at
the deal that he offered you...
And I'd be happy to do
a debt deal with you,
but the --
the 6% is -- is --
Well, what's your counter?
My counteroffer would be
$2 million at a 7% interest rate
for 1% equity.
Oh, that's not enough.
1%?
I don't get out of bed
for that.
But also, too, we work
really hard for our money.
It's huge
to get two Sharks.
But we work hard
for our money, too.
It's huge
to get two Sharks.
You're asking for
a lot of money, though, guys.
1% is a no.
That's clear.
Yeah, that --
that doesn't work.
Brian, another counter?
That's my last counter.
1% of equity? That's all
you're willing to give up?
I'd love to make a deal
with you guys,
but it's got to be
in the range of the market.
All right, hang on. He's
about to make another counter.
I'll do the deal $2 million,
7%, 36 months, 3% equity.
You got to pay something
for two Sharks.
You don't get that --
Well, Kevin, hang on.
Is Lori in on that?
4%.
For you to do it?
2% each?
4%.
Okay, here's the deal.
We'll give you the $2 million.
I've spoken to my partner, Lori.
You get two Sharks.
It's a 7% interest loan
for 3 years,
which is enough
to prove your concept,
and we want, when we close
the deal with you,
4% equity -- 2% each.
It's a done deal, my friend,
if you say yes.
[ Chuckles ]
So, we -- we know
the venture debt market,
and what's market is
a little bit higher --
Here's the difference.
Venture debt from any firm...
Yeah.
...is one thing.
Venture debt from Mr. Wonderful
and Lori, Queen of QVC...
Yeah.
...that has
huge value to you.
You become
the "it" kids.
You're
a "Shark Tank" deal.
You've got
two sophisticated investors
from "Shark Tank"
who care about you,
and you come into
the Shark Tank ecosphere.
It's a good pitch.
All of a sudden,
you're on TV every day.
You're a great salesman.
Yeah, that's a good pitch.
So, I'm gonna provide
one more counter,
and this would be
our best offer.
We can't give out
4% equity.
What's your counter,
Brian?
It would be 2.5% of the equity,
and we'll pay you back,
and we'll work
to set the terms
that you guys
are comfortable with.
3.5%.
3.5%.
We'll do it --
We'll do it at 3.5%.
Ooh.
3.5% is really
too much for us.
2.5% is final offer.
And we'd love to have you guys.
[ Whispering indistinctly ]
[ Cuban chuckles ]
Okay, look, last offer,
and you should take this.
You'd be foolish not to.
We'll do it for 3%.
You got a deal.
John: Ah. Wow.
[ Chuckles ]
Greiner: Wow.
I didn't think
that was gonna happen.
Thank you, guys.
Very interested.
Glad you got this.
Thank you.
No problem.
Nice project.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're really excited
to have two Sharks.
Kevin's gonna bring us
his financial wizardry.
Lori's got her portfolio
of products.
We've built a big business
over the last three years,
but we're really
just scratching the surface
of what
we want to achieve,
and so we're ready
to go to the next level.
Narrator: Earlier this season,
Wombi Rose and John Wise
made a deal
with Kevin O'Leary
for their pop-up greeting-card
company Lovepop.
I have a lot of businesses
that are involved
around marriage and engagement,
and I have so many customers
that would buy this.
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.
Rose:
When we pitched on "Shark Tank,"
we had $300,000 in sales
after a year and a half
in business.
In the last two months,
we've done $1 million in sales.
There are a lot of directions
we can go with Lovepop,
and we really look to Kevin
to help us pick where
we should focus our energy.
-Gentlemen.
-Hey, Kevin.
-Hey.
O'Leary:
From the moment I saw them,
I knew Lovepop would be a
success, and I was right.
These guys are killing it.
We've hit a million bucks
right out of the gate.
The plan is to hit $5 million
to $8 million this year.
In order for that to happen,
number one,
selling online direct
to our customers.
Number two,
selling big-box retailers.
And now being part of the
Something Wonderful platform,
getting into
the wedding business.
I invested in Lovepop
because they fit
on my Something Wonderful
platform,
the platform that supports
the wedding industry
and all the special moments
in people's lives.
These Lovepop cards
are perfect for that.
So, Kevin, this is
how we used your investment.
Now, that is really cool.
"Shark Tank" put us
on a national stage,
and now it's up to us
to do something
really special with it.
I love it when money just grows
on trees. That's fantastic.
Rose:
Our mission has always been
to encourage people
to tell their loved ones
that they really do care.
Thanks to the millions
of "Shark Tank" viewers
and Kevin's strategic advice,
we're able to spread
that message to everyone.
Lovepop, baby!
Oh, yeah!
[ All cheering ]
Narrator: Next into the Tank is
a convenient way to eat healthy.
Friends with, uh, Jessica Alba
and, uh, Brian,
who have The Honest Company,
and they are --
We would love
to license to them.
I mean, we're --
we're absolutely willing
to do whatever is best
for the business.
Okay.
So, I like the space.
I'll give you an offer.
Sure.
Uh, $500,000 for...
15%.
We -- We wouldn't be comfortable
doing that.
Detrimental
to our investors
and our ability to raise
in the future.
This is not just money.
You said you want us to help and
actually go to work, as well.
O'Leary: Let me structure
something a different way.
I'll give you
the $500,000, okay?
Your margins are fantastic.
You can afford to pay me
6.75% royalty
until I receive $1.5 million,
[ Whistles ]
regardless of how long
that takes.
Then that goes away.
It's gone.
It's not in perpetuity.
I've got a decent return,
but that's not all.
I want 3% equity
because I'm Mr. Wonderful.
That's actually
not a bad deal.
We could go get debt
for 6%, though.
John:
But then why are you here?
