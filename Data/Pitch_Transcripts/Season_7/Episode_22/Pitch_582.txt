Hi. My name is Stephanie Boone,
and this is Mercy.
I'm Laura Alter,
and we're from Austin, Texas.
Our company is Wondercide,
There's natural products for
pets today, Stephanie. I mean --
But it's not
Mr. Wonderful debt.
Alter:
That's not -- Right.
You keep telling us
why you shouldn't be here.
I-I disagree,
respectfully.
Well, why are you here, then?
You can get 6%.
O'Leary: I don't have a problem
with your business.
I have a problem
with your valuation.
5% -- You know what?
Your 5%...
There's not a chance in hell.
That's -- I'm not gonna
get up in the morning for 5%.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
and Stephanie and Laura have
two offers on the table,
but the Sharks have an issue
with the high valuation
of their natural insect-
repellent company, Wondercide.
I'm not gonna
get up in the morning for 5%.
So, guys, you've done
a great job.
But there's just
a lot of confusion to me.
I got to be honest
with you.
Look, Stephanie, Laura,
I-I-I can't get excited,
like Lori said, for that amount,
