is a safer alternative
to chemical bug repellent.
Hi. My name is Stephanie Boone,
and this is Mercy.
I'm Laura Alter,
and we're from Austin, Texas.
Our company is Wondercide,
and we're seeking $500,000 in
exchange for 5% of our company.
Oh.
Wondercide solves a problem
that affects everyone.
Together: Bugs!
Ew!
Have you
ever thought about
what's actually
in the products
you use to protect your family
and pets from bugs?
These products are actually
toxic pesticides.
That's right.
We're putting them directly
on our pets, on our children.
We're spraying them
in our kitchens,
and we're sprinkling them
all over our lawns,
all because of bugs.
Wondercide is
a truly effective,
natural,
and organic product line
that kills bugs
without toxic chemicals.
Wondercide is lab-tested,
mom approved...
[ Chuckles ]
...and made in the USA.
There are really
only three things that matter
when it comes to products
that kill bugs.
First, it has to work.
Check!
[ Chuckles ]
Second,
it has to be safe.
Check!
Third, you have to be able
to get it fast.
That's why we need
<i>your</i> check.
[ Laughter ]
Checks.
With your help, we can replace
America's pesticides with...
Together: Wondercide!
We'll now pass out samples,
and we're happy to answer
your questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
John: Thank you.
Is this for pets only?
Yes, sir, the same formulation
is effective
as an insect repellent
for people
of flea-and-tick control
for pets
and hundreds of pests
ranging from ants and mosquitoes
to even bedbugs.
And so you'd also use it to
spray elsewhere around the house
to stop mosquitoes?
In your kitchen,
carpeting, furniture.
Non-staining
and dries clear.
What separates you
from everybody else?
What makes you unique?
There's natural products for
pets today, Stephanie. I mean --
Most of the products,
both chemical and natural,
are using 95% water
and then a small amount
of active ingredient.
Our product has
no water in it.
Wondercide has the power
of a pesticide
and the safety
of food-grade ingredients.
So, I'm just trying
to understand the core market,
because you're
kind of presenting
a little bit of everything.
If we had to pick one,
our current traction
is in the pet market.
Do you have sales?
We do.
We -- We have, um,
just over $4 million in sales.
Oh!
Cuban: $50 mill.
O'Leary: Where's the $4 million
coming from?
Oh! This -- This year?
This year we're tracking
for between
$3 million
and $3.5 million.
[ All speaking indistinctly ]
Pet market. Break it down.
Break it down.
What is it?
Break it down.
The pet market is 75%
of that $4 million.
How'd you come up
with this?
This is Luna.
She's the reason that I --
that I founded the company.
She actually had
an adverse reaction to, uh,
a vet-prescribed monthly
flea-and-tick control product,
and, uh,
she's the reason that --
that we started
the company.
Aww.
Wow. So, how were you able
to make this compound?
So --
Like, are you a chemist?
I was a real-estate
tax accountant.
I had no formal training
in chemistry or -- or business.
And so I literally --
I quit my job,
and I literally became
this mad scientist,
and I set up my garage --
On your own?
On my own.
Have you tested it for bedbugs
or for mosquito landings?
We -- We have,
and we actually have --
We have test results
we'd love to show.
We actually have some test
results that we could show.
Oh, let's see.
We have 100% mortality
in under 30 seconds for fleas.
And then within 24 hours,
we still have 100% mortality.
The product has also been tested
against ticks and bedbugs,
and within half a minute,
there's 88% mortality,
1 minute, 94%,
and within 2 minutes,
we have 100%.
I want to know where, uh,
have the sales been coming from?
80% of our sales
are online.
Good for you.
-Wow.
-Wow.
-80%.
45% through our website,
35% through Amazon.
What's -- What's
your margins right now?
So, our total gross margin
for the company is 70%.
70% margin? That's like
talking dirty to me.
[ Both laugh ]
So, what are you gonna do
with the funds?
The funds we're here
to raise today
are to hire
our first key sales hire.
They're gonna hunt
600 new wholesale accounts
over the next 12 months
to generate $1 million
in additional revenue.
Why spend money on schmoes going
door to door
trying to sell
to pet stores?
So, we --
Why add this additional
risk factor
where your return probably is
not gonna be as great?
And crush your margins.
We live in a-a
convenience-driven market.
You need something,
and you need it fast.
Make no mistake -- We will
continue to hyper-focus online.
We don't intend to change
our revenue mix dramatically.
But retail,
we'll proportionately grow.
Why can't you grow
three times faster
than you are now
and avoid --
Let's partner
and figure it out.
Every Shark has
the same concern.
Retail's a different business
than what you've experienced.
I can speak canine,
and Mercy's telling me,
"Don't let these women
go into retail."
[ Cuban chuckles ]
Oh, my God.
Even the dog knows.
Well, we would certainly
appreciate --
I think that we cannot change
consumer behavior.
So, here's where
I stand with it.
But it's not
Mr. Wonderful debt.
Alter:
That's not -- Right.
You keep telling us
why you shouldn't be here.
I-I disagree,
respectfully.
Well, why are you here, then?
You can get 6%.
O'Leary: I don't have a problem
with your business.
I have a problem
with your valuation.
5% -- You know what?
Your 5%...
There's not a chance in hell.
That's -- I'm not gonna
get up in the morning for 5%.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
and Stephanie and Laura have
two offers on the table,
but the Sharks have an issue
with the high valuation
of their natural insect-
repellent company, Wondercide.
I'm not gonna
get up in the morning for 5%.
So, guys, you've done
a great job.
But there's just
a lot of confusion to me.
You say, "Okay,
we need brick and mortar
because people don't want
three-day delivery."
I don't want
to get mixed in that.
I'm out.
I believe
that the best deals are done
when both parties are
a little uncomfortable.
I have an offer standing
for $500,000 for 15%.
So, you just have to say
yes or no.
Come into my office here.
I --
Well, I --
Let's come
into Lori's office.
Greiner:
We are in Lori's office now.
Wait, wait, I --
No, I gave you an offer first.
Let's go to Lori's office.
[ All speaking indistinctly ]
Soundproof walls.
That's the ultimate counter.
[ Laughs ]
John:
Can I get an answer?
So, 5% doesn't excite me.
Okay, we could
go higher on equity
if we went higher
on cash,
higher
on the investment.
O'Leary:
I think everybody's choking
on the $10 million value,
I got to be honest
with you.
Look, Stephanie, Laura,
I-I-I can't get excited,
like Lori said, for that amount,
and I don't want to put up
more money for this.
Um, I just don't know the scope
of the market at this point.
Great job, though.
Thank you.
I'm out.
Let me make a suggestion
that may help here, okay?
Lori, you don't like the 5%.
Let me suggest something.
Come into my offer,
because you're gonna get
your money back times two.
Three times.
Yes.
You're gonna
get your cash back.
Greiner:
I have an offer for you.
$500,000, 50 cents
every unit sold, whatever sold,
until I get my money back,
then 3% equity in the company.
Wow.
It's a good deal.
[ Whispers indistinctly ]
Daymond, would you be --
Would you guys
be interested in --
in doing a deal
like that together?
So, you're gonna give him
50 cents, too?
They'd have to sell
a million units
before you get
your capital back.
I'm not --
I'm not interested in that deal.
You know how far
and fast this can go?
I mean...
That's a crazy offer.
[ Chuckles ] It's a really good
offer. What's your decision?
[ Both speaking indistinctly ]
'Cause things can happen.
Things can change here
quickly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, Lori,
we'd love to do that deal.
Yay! Whoo!
Whoo!
'Cause they were talking.
Something
was gonna happen.
Yay, girls.
Mercy,
we're gonna do a deal!
I like it.
Yay.
I have been wanting to do
something like this a long time.
Thank you.
We're so excited.
Thank you, everyone.
We appreciate.
Thank you, everyone.
We appreciate your time.
You did a great job, guys.
Thank you.
It was clear
that Lori wanted to make a deal.
She wanted a little something
more than just the equity,
so by lowering her equity
and giving her a royalty
on every product sold,
we are perfectly aligned with
Lori's interest and to ours,
and we know
we're gonna change the world.
