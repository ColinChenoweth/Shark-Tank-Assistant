Hi, Sharks.
My name Steven Blustein.
And I'm Sean Knecht.
Both: And we're the founders
of PrideBites pet products.
We are seeking $200,000
for 10% of our company.
If you're
anything like us,
your pet is
a member of you family.
And because of that,
we believe
that they should be spoiled
in a way
that is
completely unique.
So let me introduce you
to PrideBites.
We allow you to design,
customize, and buy
anything you want
for you furry friend,
providing one-of-a-kind products
for your one-of-a-kind pet.
So, like Sadie here,
in her personalized collar,
your dog can truly feel like
man's best friend.
Our process is
incredibly simple.
First, select from one
of the high-quality products
on our website.
Next, pick the size,
color, pattern,
and design
of your choice.
Finally, add
your personal paw-print
by including
your pet's name
or even one of our amazing,
hand-drawn portraits.
-[ Giggles ]
-In just a few weeks,
your items will be delivered
right to your door.
So, Sharks, which one of you is
ready to get your paws dirty
and to join us
on proving more choices
for our
four-legged friends?
Sadie, high ten!
Yeah!
[ Laughter ]
-Aww.
-So, Sean's gonna go ahead
and hand out our custom stuff
that we made for all of you.
Aww, what's
the dog's name?
-Thank you. Hey, baby.
-The dog's name is Sadie.
[ Smooches ]
Hey. Aww, she's adorable.
All right. Sorry.
-So, this is yours...
-Thank you very much.
-...for your dog Lola.
Aww!
-For you.
-Thank you.
Is this a toy?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Look at this.
-Very attractive.
Greiner:
Oh, it's a Frisbee.
It looks like her!
Yeah, so, that was
actually a picture
that we took from your dog,
and then one of our hand --
our designers hand-draws
everything...
-Very cool. Thank you.
-...to match your portrait.
That's really good.
Yeah,
thank you very much.
[ Toy squeaks ]
So, what are
the price ranges?
Uh, we range from $9.99
all the way up to $150.
So, you guys are Shutterfly
for pet products.
Sure. So, this is
where we differ
from Shutterfly,
actually.
With Shutterfly,
you're just putting
a picture on a blanket.
We actually custom-manufacturer
from scratch.
You're the designer,
so think of it as a blank slate.
So, you to pick a red blanket,
customizing the trim,
uh, you put
your monogram in.
So, I order today.
When will I receive the product?
So the turnaround time right now
is within four weeks,
but we have all the solutions
in place
to drop it down
to two weeks and one week.
Where are you manufacturing
and doing this all out of?
Everything is done overseas,
and what we've built is
this amazing
proprietary system
that allows us to organize
the whole customization process
and allows us
to scale efficiently.
And so, typically
you're not able to deliver
the margins
to direct to consumer
with customized products,
but we've actually built
this system that allows the
factories to work seamlessly.
So, walk us
through the margins, Steven.
Yeah, absolutely, so,
the margin's
about 50% landed
to -- to the consumer.
And, so,
what are your sales?
You've been doing it
for how long?
About 2 1/2 years.
Sales to date are
$1.4 million.
Whoa!
Wow.
This year, we're on pace
to do $1.3 million.
-Good for you.
-Nice.
-Thank you very much.
-Is it all online?
-No, it's not actually.
-Oh, it's not?
We've had sales for brands
and retailers, as well,
that make about 70%.
Wait.
Explain that to me.
Explain where 70%
of your business comes from.
Yeah, 70% is to brands
and retailers
who want
a customized product.
We've been prototyping
custom kiosks within store
so that people can come in
and customize on the spot.
To improve
the customer experience.
But, Steven, you can't be making
50 points on the retail.
What's your margin
on the retail?
On the retail,
it's 40 points.
How did you come up
with this idea?
We started
in our college apartment.
Uh, we really built it up.
-[ Smooches ]
We literally started selling
these dog toys door-to-door
and going
to football tailgates.
We literally sold
everywhere.
And we sold this product called
the "Pride Bite."
-Which one?
-This -- This toy.
The pizza?
We started out with
a standard, classic toy.
[ Toy squeaks ]
Knecht: It won
Dog Toy of the Year.
[ Toy squeaking ]
It floats. It squeaks --
machine washable.
It's one of the most
versatile toys on the market.
Guys, let me get
the ball rolling here.
Look, you've done
a great job.
The challenge is
there's not really
a barrier
to entry there.
I-I think it's gonna be a very,
very challenging business.
I just don't think
I can help you scale.
I think it's going
to be difficult.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
-Okay.
-Thank you for your time.
I think you're
a little expensive in valuation
because this is
a customized commodity play
in pet products, which is
a pretty big market, I think.
Pet market is big --
$80 billion.
Well, I think
dog pizza slices aren't
going to fit
in my portfolio.
I'm not really moved
by it.
I'm out.
Greiner: So...
you haven't really been selling
that much online,
but the whole big,
unique thing about you is
the whole
customization thing...
Right.
...that you're going
and doing online.
Yeah, so, we actually took
3,500 orders
in the first 90 days.
And it was the run to say,
"Hey, we've gone
from doing customization
within store.
We know
that we can do it in store.
What does online feel?"
We launched online with a site,
took 3,500 orders --
You've got to do
more online.
-Right.
-Absolutely. Absolutely.
-Now it's our focus.
-And so now it's our pure focus.
Herjavec: What I really like
about it is the fact that you --
you've really figured
something out at this scale
where you can do small runs
and do it efficiently.
Yeah.
The timeframe's
a bit of a problem.
I don't know if people are
that patient to wait,
but you say
you're gonna cut that down.
-Absolutely.
-That's the big --
So, we're making
that shift now because --
No, no, I got it.
You're gonna get there,
and I think I can help
you with that.
And we have a great team.
Absolutely.
With that, um...
I think you're --
We know you're a pet guy.
We know it.
And I love dogs!
My offer is
$200,000 for 20%.
Well, thank you very much
for that offer.
Thank you.
We really appreciate it.
Guys, so this very --
this is very impressive.
I like your logistics.
My biggest challenge is
that your --
your not there online,
and the area
that I don't want to go into is
the premium market
of selling tchotchke stuff
to big stores
and big outlets.
So, at this point,
I don't think it's for me.
I'm out.
Thank you very much
for your time.
Thank you for your time.
So, three Sharks are out.
So, my question is
are you willing to negotiate
a little bit
on the equity portion
and come down
to meet us at 15%?
Make me a counter.
Uh, so --
Greiner: I haven't made you
my offer yet.
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.
Steven and Sean have one offer
on the table from Robert --
$200,000 for 20% equity in their
customized-pet-product business,
PrideBites.
But Lori says
she wants to make an offer.
So, my question is
are you willing to negotiate
a little bit
on the equity portion
and come down to --
to meet us at 15%?
Make me a counter.
Uh, so --
Greiner: I haven't made you
my offer yet.
Ooh!
Interesting!
And I'd like
to make you an offer.
Okay. Please.
Because I like
your style.
-Thank you very much.
-I like the look.
-Thank you.
-I think it's very cute.
I've sold a lot of personalized
things over the years.
I know a lot my customers
really love to personalize.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to make you
an offer of $200,000 at 18%.
Uh, Robert, is there any counter
there within you could bring?
-Ohh!
-Ohh!
Would you all be willing
to join together?
To join together.
What if we did
$300,000 for 20%
and you guys came in
together?
Such a deal!
You can't turn that down.
$300,000 for how much?
Uh, $300,000 for 20%.
So, $300,000 for 20%, you're
saying $1.5 million value.
With two Sharks, yeah.
With two Sharks.
You came in
at a $2 million value...
$300,000 for 30%.
Uh, 20%.
Sorry.
$300,000 for 30%.
20%.
$300,000 for 30%.
15% each --
You've got two Sharks,
and you've got more cash.
-$300,000 for 30%.
I would do that.
If we could calm down
to 20%,
we would make a deal
right now.
We'd love to work
with you guys.
Both of you.
You'll get something --
We promise you,
we will never sleep.
We hustle.
$200,000 for 20%.
-Two Sharks?
-Two Sharks.
-All right, y'all got a deal.
-Deal.
-Done.
-Awesome.
[ Laughter ]
Wait a minute.
Well, are you in?
We were at $300,000
for 30% a minute ago?
Right, and we dropped it
to $200,000 for 20%.
And Robert jumped up
and said "deal"?
-With both -- both of you.
-I thought -- I thought both
of y'all were coming in
on it.
We would love --
Two Sharks are better than one.
We would love two Sharks.
Lori's doing a little
Michael Jackson moonwalk on you.
All right,
I'll tell you what --
If Lori doesn't do it,
I'll do it with Robert,
and you'll have
two Sharks.
No. I'm in.
-Yes! All right!
-Awesome!
-My God!
-Yes! Thank you so much!
[ Laughter ]
Yay!
-Thank you.
-Did you really want the deal,
Herjavec: or you just wanted
to screw Kevin?
[ Laughter ]
-Thank you so much.
-[ Laughs ]
We appreciate it.
Thank y'all so much.
Knecht: Come on, let's go!
Hey, grab your leash!
Grab your leash.
Let's go!
Let's go.
Yes, dude, yes!
Oh, my God.
Blustein: I think having
two Sharks, you don't only get
all the skills
and the traits
from what Robert brings
to the table...
Yeah.
...but also, um,
the amazing presence
that Lori has, as well.
And in combination
with our team,
we feel like we can
take over the world,
essentially,
in the pet world.
Kevin, throw the Frisbee!
Kevin!
Are you kidding?
This is incredibly valuable!
Throw the Frisbee!
No!
I don't want to damage it.
Here you go!
Here you go, Robby!
[ Laughter ]
I'm at the Orgill Dealer Market
in Orlando.
It's a huge trade show,
and 10 of my "Shark Tank"
entrepreneurs are here.
The Scrub Daddy is
actually lab-tested
to not hold odors
for up to two months.
Greiner: Having all my companies
in one section is like
a magnet for retail buyers.
Before I partnered
with these businesses,
their combined sales were
about $8 million.
Since I've invested,
total sales are $188 million.
Well, here's
how easy it works --
Man: Sometimes, you can't
even get buyers on the phone,
but at this trade show
you get to meet them,
and you actually close the sale
right there in person.
Put the strip right on,
hit it with the blow dryer,
and that's it.
Woman: Each trade show gives us
a chance to interact
with our customers
and get real feedback
on what
they're looking for.
And I just got hacked.
Well, if you'd had this,
it wouldn't have happened.
Man: This is
my first trade show ever,
but being in her section
with the rest
of her entrepreneurs gives me
a ton of confidence.
-Can I give you one of these?
-Yes.
Man: It feels great
to be in Lori's section.
I feel like
the coolest kid in school.
Everybody wants
to come talk to you.
So, feel that.
Man: Face-to-face interaction
fuels excitement and loyalty.
They go back to their stores
invigorated to sell Scrub Daddy.
-We're doing really well.
-High five!
Man: This has been
a killer show.
We got so much new business,
I don't know how to keep up.
Well, we're gonna lower
the price here.
We already sold tens
of thousands of dollars
at this trade show.
-It's 1,000 degrees here.
-Wow!
Man: We've already sold
over $15,000 of product,
and it's only the first day.
Spread the word.
Woman: It's been a real
privilege doing business
with Lori.
It really has put us
on the map.
Excited to do business
with you. Thank you.
Us, too.
She has such a great sense
for business,
and she's just
an incredible mentor.
So proud of all of you!
Greiner: There isn't much more
I could ask for as an investor.
They've done sales that many
people wish to do in a lifetime.
This is truly a dream come true.
All: Team Lori!
Narrator: Next up is a modern
version of a traditional toy.
