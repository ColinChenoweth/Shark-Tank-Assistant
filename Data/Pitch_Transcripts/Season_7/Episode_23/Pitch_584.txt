Harden: This is
what I'm offering to you --
a dude who's got fire in his
belly like you've never seen!
Narrator:
Who are the Sharks?
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist
who made his fortune
selling a children's
educational company
for over $4 billion.
Daymond John dominated
the fashion world with FUBU.
Harden: Your adventure today,
on the TV here, is
"What do Sharks Eat?"
-[ Laughs ]
-Aww.
-Aww.
-Have a seat right here.
[ Laughing ] Good luck getting
out of that stool.
You can turn around
to the Sharks if you like.
-[ Laughs ]
-Aww.
Harden: Here's your pal.
Isn't he sweet?
[ Chuckles ]
Hit the right arrow
to get started.
Harden: There you go.
Drag it right over.
Perfect.
There you are.
He's doing great, isn't he?
-[ Laughs ]
John: Can I keep this?
You can't.
[ Laughter ]
You have to complete
the puzzle to move forward.
All right, take
a little sippy, "Pookie."
[ Laughter ]
All right.
Thank you so much, Daymond.
[ Laughter ]
Harden: It's more special
than the first one you had.
-Thank you. Thank you.
-They're very cuddly.
This is where
the sound comes out of.
Both: Exactly.
I can't control
the tablet from here.
Harden: Correct.
