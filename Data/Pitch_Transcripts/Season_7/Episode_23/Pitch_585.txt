Sheldon: Our society has
a serious problem
where people are focused
way too much on their phones
in the parks, in
the restaurants --
especially Sheldon.
You know, I think there's a few
things we need to talk about.
[ Cellphone rings ]
Oh, hold on a second.
Gould: It's crazy.
[ Laughter ]
Sheldon:
Get it here, Lori.
Let's look
at some samples.
For Robert,
for you we have
the NoPhone
with the selfie upgrade.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, thank you.
Lori.
Oh, thank you.
Mr. Wonderful, NoPhone
with the selfie upgrade.
Oh.
Let's do a selfie.
[ Laughing ]
Let's do a selfie.
