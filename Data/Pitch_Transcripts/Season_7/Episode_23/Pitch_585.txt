-I'm Van.
-And I'm Sheldon.
Gould: And we're
from New York City.
[ Elevator bell dings ]
We met in grad school,
and we now work
at an ad agency.
Sheldon: Our society has
a serious problem
where people are focused
way too much on their phones
and not enough
on each other.
You know, everywhere you go,
people are just starting
down at that screen --
on the streets,
in the parks, in
the restaurants --
especially Sheldon.
You know, I think there's a few
things we need to talk about.
[ Cellphone rings ]
Oh, hold on a second.
Gould: It's crazy.
And that's when we realized
what a huge problem this was.
Sheldon: And that's
when we came up with our idea.
What do you think
of that?
I think that could work.
[ Horn honks ]
Gould: We designed our concept,
and it really works.
Look, we know
how crazy-fun dependency can be.
But with our product,
anyone can get past it.
And once we put
our idea online,
we received
thousands of e-mails
from people who desperately
wanted our product.
With the Sharks' help,
we can get this product
in the hands
of millions of Americans.
We believe a day, an hour,
or even five minutes
with no phone can really bring
the world together.
Hello, Sharks.
And I'm Van Gould.
We're seeking $25,000
for 15% equity in our company.
There's a huge problem
in the world right now.
And it's called...
Both: Phone addiction.
A recent report found
that 79% of adults have
their cellphones with them
22 hours a day.
People are driving
with their phones,
sleeping
with their phones,
and even going on dates
with their phones.
Some people can't
even stop looking
at their phones
while they're on TV.
[ Laughter ]
But don't worry, Sharks.
We have the solution.
Introducing --
Da-dum.
-The NoPhone.
-The NoPhone.
The NoPhone is
a technology-free alternative
to constant
hand-to-phone contact.
It's a fake phone for people
addicted to real phones.
[ Laughs ]
It has no screen.
No battery.
-No apps.
-It has no features at all.
[ Laughter ]
Here's how it works.
Step one --
Pick it up.
Step two -- Hold it.
It's that simple!
[ Laughs ]
There's no warranty,
no returns,
and it's not intended
to be used for anything.
[ Laughs ]
With your help,
we can make the NoPhone
the Pet Rock
of our generation.
[ Laughs ]
Let's take
a quick group selfie
with the NoPhone's
latest addition,
"The Selfie Upgrade."
[ Laughs ]
It's a mirror.
[ Laughter ]
Sheldon:
Get it here, Lori.
Let's look
at some samples.
For Robert,
for you we have
the NoPhone
with the selfie upgrade.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, thank you.
Lori.
Oh, thank you.
Mr. Wonderful, NoPhone
with the selfie upgrade.
Oh.
Let's do a selfie.
[ Laughing ]
Let's do a selfie.
And the instruction manual.
And here -- NoPhone
with selfie upgrade.
So, how many
have you sold?
We've sold over 3,100
since we've started
in November
of last year.
And one
out of every three people buy
the selfie upgrade.
Are you serious?
-Yeah.
-Oh, absolutely, yeah.
-3,100?
-We've 45 thou--
about $42,000 in sales
since we started.
Wow.
What does this cost
if you wanted to buy it?
$12 for the regular NoPhone,
and then $18 for the NoPhone
with the selfie upgrade.
-[ Laughs ]
-With the upgrade?
Cuban: How much does it cost you
to make them?
Right.
Right now the cost
to make it is $2.95.
Where have you sold them?
We sell it completely
at our online store, right now.
Online?
How did you guys come up
with this?
We were actually
at a rooftop bar,
and we were all staring at
our phones like we normally do.
And we looked up
from our phones,
and everyone in the bar was
also staring at their phones,
and we kind of like --
"This is crazy.
Everyone can not put
their phones down
for any point of the day."
And that's when we came up
with the idea for the NoPhone.
Um, yeah,
and we created a website,
and it was amazing.
The responses we received
all over the world,
they're like,
"My sister needs this.
My dad needs this."
[ Laughter ]
It's cute,
but I think pragmatically
it's never gonna be
a very big business.
It's like
I'm in an alternate world.
[ Laughter ]
I'm on the other side
where products are made
with absolutely no value.
While you're doing that,
I'm checking my messages.
[ Laughter ]
We're here
because we really think
we can make this a much bigger
thing with your help.
And, um --
Have you tried, uh, going
to a Spencer's
or something like that?
We haven't done a lot of that.
I mean, we both work.
We're advertising guys.
-No.
-Really?
You're kidding.
[ Laughter ]
So, sales is not our expertise,
and we will admit that.
I mean,
we, you know, we --
You wouldn't know
by your numbers.
You've made
hundreds of dollars.
[ Laughter ]
It's a gag gift.
Is that the bulk of the sales?
That's definitely one of the --
one of the --
one of the ways
we're going at it, and --
I'm serious when I ask you this,
and I'm really not joking...
-Right, right.
-...is there a patent on this?
[ Laughter ]
We've applied
for a provisional patent.
-No, you did not!
-We -- we did.
-We did it ourselves.
-Yeah, we did it ourselves.
Guys, there's only one thing
I hate more
than people staring
at their phones,
and that's
dumb patents.
And you know
what's really dumb?
A patent on a block of plastic.
I'm out.
-Thank you for your time.
-Thank you.
The thing is people --
Everybody knows somebody
that's addicted
to their smartphone, and --
Greiner: You know, there's
this motivational cat poster
that says, "Hang in there."
I'm sorry to say,
in this case,
I think the cat needs
to let go.
I'm not gonna invest
in this.
-We totally understand.
-I'm out.
-Lori, that's cruel.
-[ Laughs ]
What, come on, Robert.
Guys, I think --
I think it's really clever.
I mean,
you sold 3,100 units.
I mean,
that's impressive.
My fear is that the 3,100 units
<i>is</i> the entire market.
That was only just
our store -- on one website.
Right, I mean,
imagine if we did,
you know, an infomercial
or something like that.
[ Laughter ]
-An infomercial!
-You can't --
Do not invest
more money in this.
-Are you kidding me?
-We've invested zero.
Guys, guys, I'm out.
Daymond?
I would just feel stupid
investing in this.
I'm sorry.
You're saying
it's poo-poo on a stick?
I don't --
I don't necessarily --
I don't think
anybody's business is that.
I think that
it could be a Pet Rock.
-[ Laughs ]
-But I'm out, guys.
O'Leary: Listen, the Pet Rock
was a piece of poo-poo, too.
This is poo-poo.
The best thing about this is
it's 3,100 units
and the product is
essentially nothing.
That's a very tough thing to do.
-It's not "essentially nothing."
It <i>is</i> nothing.
But we have managed to sell
nothing 3,100 times.
Look, guys, it's really bad --
really bad.
I'm out.
All right.
Y'all have a good one.
-Congrats, guys.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
-Congrats.
[ Laughs ]
Gould:
You know, the Sharks,
they missed
a huge opportunity here.
This is the NoPhone.
It's the Pet Rock
of our generation.
It's something that --
You know,
it's not just a piece a plastic.
Well, it is
a piece of plastic,
but it's gonna be
a revolution.
Narrator: Next into the tank is
a high-tech way to stay handy.
