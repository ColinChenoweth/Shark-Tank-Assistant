Harden: This is
what I'm offering to you --
a dude who's got fire in his
belly like you've never seen!
Narrator:
Who are the Sharks?
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist
who made his fortune
selling a children's
educational company
for over $4 billion.
Daymond John dominated
the fashion world with FUBU.
Now he's the branding expert
behind multiple global brands
generating billions in sales.
Robert Herjavec, son of
an immigrant factory worker,
founded one of
the world's preeminent
cyber-security firms.
Lori Greiner, the Queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents
and has launched
more than 400 products,
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in sales.
And Mark Cuban,
esteemed billionaire tech mogul
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.
First into the tank are
unique and stylish accessories
for the most important member
of the family.
Oh!
And I'm Jeremy Scheinberg,
and we're the creators of TROBO,
the storytelling robot
from Orlando, Florida,
and we're seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 10% of our company.
How many times have you heard
a stuffed toy repeat
the same mindless phrases
over and over and over again?
And it ends up at the bottom
of that toy box after two weeks
never to be played with
again.
Well, not anymore.
Introducing TROBOs.
TROBOs are
wirelessly connected,
cuddly toys
that read stories
about science and math
to children
using tablets
and phones.
Children
not only read along,
but they also interact
with questions
and puzzles
along the way.
The stories are
personalized,
and the TROBO even calls
your child by name.
We go one step further
by actually putting
the child
right into the story.
The child builds
an avatar within the app
and quickly becomes
the main character.
Okay, Daymond --
Time to come on down and meet
your new best friend, Newton.
-Yes.
-[ Laughs ]
Harden: Your adventure today,
on the TV here, is
"What do Sharks Eat?"
-[ Laughs ]
-Aww.
-Aww.
-Have a seat right here.
[ Laughing ] Good luck getting
out of that stool.
You can turn around
to the Sharks if you like.
-[ Laughs ]
-Aww.
Harden: Here's your pal.
Isn't he sweet?
[ Chuckles ]
Hit the right arrow
to get started.
Harden: There you go.
Drag it right over.
Perfect.
There you are.
He's doing great, isn't he?
-[ Laughs ]
John: Can I keep this?
You can't.
[ Laughter ]
You have to complete
the puzzle to move forward.
All right, take
a little sippy, "Pookie."
[ Laughter ]
All right.
Thank you so much, Daymond.
[ Laughter ]
-Thank you.
-Instead of landing
at the bottom
of the toy bin,
with our growing
content library,
TROBO's become the companions
and the teachers
that stick around
year after year.
And parents get a head start
on teaching science
and math in the home.
Both: Get ready, Sharks.
Here comes TROBO.
Okay, these are
personalized TROBOs.
They have
a little embroidered tag
at the back
with your names on them.
-Thank you.
-Yes.
Hmm, thank you.
-There you go.
-Aww.
-Isn't that lovely?
-[ Chuckling ] "Lori's TROBO."
-Very cute.
-Thank you.
Harden: It's more special
than the first one you had.
-Thank you. Thank you.
-They're very cuddly.
This is where
the sound comes out of.
Both: Exactly.
I can't control
the tablet from here.
Harden: Correct.
So, the only purpose
of TROBO,
besides being lovable
and cuddly, is sound?
He's a speaker.
He's a speaker, but really
it's an emotional connection
between the child and
the stories and the content.
Who creates
the content, Jeremy?
It's actually
very interesting.
We actually crowd source
the content.
So we throw out
a story topic,
and that --
We have a story contest.
People submit stories,
and we pay
for the story content.
That's a good idea.
How much
is TROBO gonna cost?
Uh, retail is $59.95 for the toy
and the first five stories.
Ooh.
What are your sales?
We have several buyers
who have placed orders.
We're talking
with manufacturers, reps,
mainly towards
mid-box retail.
What orders do you got
in place?
We've gotten some small
boutique orders at this point.
How much would it come up
to be about?
Uh, we have the total number
of orders of 600 units.
600 units -- And how many
shows did you attend
to get those 600 units?
Two.
We attended two.
Trade shows.
Did any of them show
great interest?
We did not get
that kind of response
because we were dealing
with boutique and lower volume.
There's so many learning apps
and, uh, you know,
smart plush toys
in the market.
What do you think
differentiates you?
We've been covered
in 45 publications,
TVs, magazines,
you name it.
If you only have
600 orders...
-Mm-hmm.
-...and you have
45 publications
write you up,
why did the stores
not support that?
They really -- They seemed
to be averse to risk to us.
And we'll be straight
with you.
This is a year and a half
into the industry for us.
We have a lot of skills
in manufacturing and execution,
but this is new for us.
Harden: And we appreciate
your offer.
We -- We have a hard time
with the valuation.
Would you consider going
to $166,000
for a 1/3 of our company?
That's
a $500,000 valuation.
Ooh.
So, you came in asking
for $100,000.
You're counter
to me is $166,000?
Yes.
Yes, yes.
For the 1/3.
Um...
Sure.
Welcome
to team TROBO, Robert!
All right, thank you, guys.
We'll set up the meeting.
-I mean, I --
-Congrats, guys.
We're excited.
We really are very excited!
-Yeah, thank you very much.
-Thank you so much.
Bring it in.
-Cheers, guys.
[ Laughs ]
-All right, thank you so much.
-Good luck, guys.
-Congrats, guys.
-It seems obvious to me.
-Bye, Sharks. Thank you so much.
Greiner: Bye.
Thank you.
Cuban: Congrats.
Right?
-All right.
-Ugh!
TROBO,
what are you saying?
[ High-pitched voice
Robert, you're screwed!
[ Laughs ]
[ High-pitched voice ]
Kevin, you don't know anything.
[ Laughs ]
It's never gonna work!
[ Imitates crying ]
[ Laughter ]
