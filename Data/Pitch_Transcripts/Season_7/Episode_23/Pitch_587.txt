Hello, Sharks.
My name is Chris Harden.
It's one reason why
we're here -- for you guys.
Herjavec: Chris, walk me
through the process.
Is there a monthly fee
I pay to get more stories?
$4.95 per story,
and then we're gonna switch
to a subscription model.
I think if you can get
critical mass,
you actually become a
very valuable marketing channel
for a large branch trying
to sell to those kids.
Basically, the plush toy is
your way to capture the child.
-Exactly. You get it.
-Yes. Yes.
Guys, I'm not a fan
of the idea.
To me, this is
all about content, right?
The content's
all that matters.
Unless it makes the kid go
"wow," you know,
and just was
really compelling,
and I just didn't see that
from there.
And so, you know, I don't see it
as this big blow-up,
go-out-and-crush-it type
of idea, so I'm out.
You can't sell a $50 plush toy
with a speaker in it.
That's not gonna work.
The actual content, at $4,
that's not gonna work.
There's tons
of free content
for everybody
for children's books --
free, no cost.
Having come
from this space,
you need Target,
you need Walmart to play
in the toy space
to get huge volumes.
They're not gonna put that
on the shelf for $50 bucks.
It's not gonna work.
I'm out.
Have you heard
of Teddy Ruxpin?
Back in '85, Teddy Ruxpin
sold for $70 a unit.
He sold $95 million.
-Yeah, but his mouth moved,
eyes -- Uh, it was --
It was a different time
when technology wasn't
at, you know, at it's level.
The direction you're going,
I don't --
I think you're gonna hit
a dead road.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you, Daymond.
I think the $60 price point is
a challenge.
I also listened
to the experts.
When you went
to Toy Fair,
you didn't have
people jumping on board
from any of the large retailers
to get this in.
And usually, when they see
something that's new,
innovative,
and excites them,
they're all over it.
So, I take that
as a caution,
as a warning
to me as an investor.
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Robert,
before you begin --
We haven't talked
about passion.
And I believe
that's something
that you guys look for
regularly in your teams.
Because I think
it's important.
You're looking at a guy
who was a kid on welfare.
I was one of three children
to a mom.
My father died
when I was 6 years old.
She had alcohol problems.
She ended up going to prison.
I learned a very valuable lesson
from my mom.
She told me if I could stick to
my education day in and day out,
I would get out from that,
and I have.
I focused on hard work
and education,
so I am a believer
in education.
This is what I'm offering
to you --
Two guys who can execute
like nobody's business,
and a dude who's got fire in his
belly like you've never seen!
[ Laughs ]
I'm asking you
to think about that.
Herjavec: Chris, I --
I'd like to ask
all of you guys to reconsider.
Chris, thank you
for sharing that.
Thanks
for you passion.
You know,
when I was in university --
I quit university
after my first year.
And I was sitting home
one day, and my dad,
who worked in a factory
his whole life --
Nobody had ever gotten
past high school
in my entire family,
so my dad sees me at home
and says,
"What you doing home?"
I go, "Ah, nothing.
Just watching TV.
I, uh, dropped
out of school."
So, he looks at me quitely,
and he says,
"You know I love you.
I kill you, bury you backyard.
Nobody ever find body.
Go back to school."
-[ Laughs ]
And I went back to school.
So, it's really important.
I -- Let me tell you
where I'm at,
and, uh...
Work with us, Robert.
I actually didn't --
It didn't
make me go "wow"
in the application
that Daymond was using it.
So...
I don't really see it
as a toy.
I see it
as a content-delivery business.
It really comes down
to the content.
We have an amazing relationship
with DreamWorks.
They want to go in retail.
They want to sell product.
They have amazing content.
I think that they would do
a licensed deal.
I see it as a way
for them to sell content
and a way
to sell plush animals
and some more Shreks and
all kinds of other characters.
I could broker that meeting.
We'll walk in with you.
So, I'll make you
an offer.
I'll give you $100,000
for 1/3 of the business.
That's my offer.
Is this contingent
on you landing a deal?
It's contingent
on DreamWorks picking it up
as a licensed product.
-Why would DreamWorks need
these guys to do
any of this?
Herjavec: It's a different way
to deliver content.
No, anybody can do
a plush doll.
Yeah, but you know what?
Anybody can do it. But these
guys have figured it out.
It's a connection
between the plush animal...
Well, I don't know
about that.
...and the online store.
-Well, you guys --
-Hey, I'm selling slippers
in the shape of Shrek,
and we're selling millions
of dollars' worth.
This is a way
to sell content.
My name is
Chris Sheldon.
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Jason Neubauer.
And I'm Chris Stoikos.
Our company is Coolbox.
And today,
we're here seeking
$500,000 for a 10% stake
in our company.
The toolbox has been around
for over 100 years,
and no one has been able
to significantly innovate it.
We're here
to do just that.
We have smartphones,
smart cars, and smart TVs.
Why wouldn't you want
a smarter toolbox?
Sharks,
I'd like to introduce you
to the world's first
smart toolbox, the Coolbox.
The Coolbox has
a very vast feature set.
It has a power cord
that warps around the back,
allows you to plug
into a socket,
and it activates
the pass-through power points
that go down the side.
Our two latches are
very rugged.
Lift it up, we have
a whiteboard allowing you
to take notes
on the inside.
This is just dead space
on every other toolbox
that's actually
out there.
Turn on our light, pop it out,
put it anywhere you want.
We have an iPad stand
and a iPhone stand
that allows you to stand up
when you're inside of here.
You can put an iPad,
look at notes while you're
actually working on it.
On the top, we also have
another iPad stand
or an iPhone stand depending
on if it's opened or closed.
The lid is magnetic.
You can toss
all your screws, bolts,
and spare parts on there
when you're actually working
on the job site.
We have two USB ports
that allow you
to charge iPhones, iPads.
We have our clock.
We have our bottle opener,
which we absolutely love,
'cause we all get thirsty
from time to time while
we're working.
And then
our favorite part yet,
the wireless,
Bluetooth speakers.
Wow.
You got everything in there.
We've got it all.
So, Sharks, we got
the nuts and bolts figured out.
Which one of you guys wants
to lock up an investment
and make the Coolbox
a household name?
What do you make that for,
and what do you sell it for?
Right now,
our cost is $110.
We're really looking
to get that down a lot lower.
We've presold them for $190,
but on --
When we're actually retailing
them in stores,
they're gonna be $249.
John: How many
have you presold?
We did a little
over $370,000 in presales.
Have you shipped yet
to anybody?
We have not. I'm actually
still kind of jet-lagged.
I just got back from China
two nights ago.
We were visiting
our factories there, setting up.
They've just begun
to dug the tools.
-I love the idea...
-Yep.
...but your cost is
very high,
your margins aren't
very good,
and you don't even have
retail yet or distribution,
and you're saying the business
is worth $5 million today.
We actually have
a huge order from Lowe's,
an 8,000-unit order
from them,
hat we want to do
an exclusive with --
-Ah! There's the other shoe.
-So, 8,000, 8,000 --
You have an 8,000-unit order.
It's a firm sale?
No, they didn't.
They just basically --
They have intent to buy.
They said,
"Come back as soon as" --
What does that mean,
"intent to buy"?
We said we can ship to you guys
at the end of September.
They said they want to do
a Q4 exclusive with us.
We said we're --
-So, why wouldn't you just say,
"Yes, done.
Give me the purchase order."
And then go factored,
get it factored.
Greiner: Right.
'Cause they don't give purchase
orders more than two months out.
So when are they gonna give you
the purchase order?
We're about --
about 30 days away.
Yeah, we're looking
to ship these units
at the end of September.
How long is the exclusive for
with those guys?
Just Q4.
We actually had extreme interest
from Stanley Black &amp; Decker.
I mean, the licensing of the
opportunity is huge for us.
Guys, this is obviously
a capital-intensive business.
How much have you guys put in?
Have you raised money?
Give us
kind of the scoop.
No, we haven't.
That's what we need.
We put in $50,000
of our own money to
bootstrap this thing.
We need help
on the money side.
We need people to put this in
so that we can put these orders
and start rolling
so that when we go to Lowe's
in these meetings,
we're saying, "Yes.
We can deliver these
within 60 days."
Do you have a patent
on this?
Yeah, we have
a provisional patent right now.
What's the patent on?
It can't be just --
Utility -- all of the
different features combined
into one toolbox.
So nobody else can put
Bluetooth speakers in a toolbox?
It's the combination.
It's the Bluetooth speakers,
the USB ports, the lights,
the magnetic lid,
the iPad stand.
Greiner: Well,
let me ask you a question.
-Yeah.
-Let's say that somebody makes
a toolbox that doesn't have
a magnetic top
but has speakers.
-I think, at the end of the day,
you really do want
to establish a brand go for --
I think at any point
you could --
So, how are you going
to license it
to Black &amp; Decker? They're
gonna rip it off in a second.
No, they're --
We were just there.
I was in Israel visiting
their head office.
They have a head of storage
and tools.
Because we're the first ones
in this market,
we have the ability
to be able to, you know,
create and shift and move
with newer innovations.
How much money did you sink
into making the molds overseas?
All told, it's gonna be
about $250,000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, so,
how are you gonna pay
for the inventory
to deliver these?
That's why we weren't able
to give Lowe's a definitive
because you never want to
bite off more than you can chew.
I understand --
-So how many units do you have
to ship
for your $375,000?
Uh, we have to ship
2,200 units.
So, how are you gonna
pay for the inventory
for the 2,200 units?
We're raising a total round
of $1 million, right now.
Oh, with others?
[ All groan ]
The million-dollar route
we were gonna do
at a $4 million
valuation.
You need $250,000
right now to just fulfill
your obligation
to all the people
that have placed orders.
-Correct.
You said you kind of have
contacts at Black &amp; Decker,
'cause I'm interested
in a licensing play here.
But I really believe
that you think
that you're worth $5 million,
and that's not the case.
I'm gonna have to bring you down
to a realistic number.
My offer is $500,000 for 25%,
but I want to license this.
Okay.
Thank you.
Are there -- Are there maybe --
Hear some other offers?
Herjavec: Chris, let me --
Jason, let me tell you --
I loved it
when you first came in.
Um, at the price point
you're at, at $240 --
I mean, toolboxes are
$20, $30, $35.
They don't have
all the functionality,
but I don't think
people care.
We're not comparing
to those toolboxes.
When you're blue-collar,
you're nitty-gritty,
you want to go in.
You want to touch this thing.
You want to be able to see it
when it's on the actual shelf.
I don't know, man.
If you're blue collar,
are you gonna spend that kind
of money on a toolbox --
240 bucks -- because
it has speakers in it?
Guys spend $200
on their speakers.
They spend $50
on their Coolbox.
All of these things
actually together costs
upwards of $400
when you buy these things.
And this is something
that every one of them has
in their actual toolkit
when they go to the job site.
You know what?
My dad was a blue collar guy.
He just wanted a toolbox
that was sturdy and it worked.
He didn't want
all the other crap in it.
He would have never spent
$240 bucks on a toolbox.
I see
a lot of challenges.
I don't want to go down
that road with you.
I'm out.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Robert.
O'Leary: You know
what I'm worried about?
You feel that you're gonna
be successful in retail.
We haven't seen
sell-through yet.
Every time
you inventory one of those
into a big box retailer,
you need one to display,
'cause people have
to see it,
and then maybe two or three
that are in inventory
to support sell-through.
That's gonna tie up
a ton of cash.
I mean, this is why
it's a license deal.
Yeah, maybe, but --
You need somebody else
to take all that.
I don't think
a licensee, either,
isn't going
to ignore that risk.
This is
a very capital-intensive --
John: But a licensee like
a Black &amp; Decker
who already has the space --
Yeah, but they're the ones
that are gonna want
complete patent protection,
'cause they're
not gonna take it out.
'Cause I don't see
how you patent this.
Stoikos: Correct,
which is what -- They're looking
at our patent right now,
but, Kevin, how many times
has somebody told you
the things that you're doing
are completely risky and
you've gone on your own and --
And those are
always the best businesses.
Of course, those are
the best businesses.
-Look, I --
-And not that --
O'Leary: I've learned something
about a business
that's capital-intensive.
The more successful you are,
the more capital it ties up.
And the risk is
always as you're running
and you're growing,
you're tying up more capital.
Then, something changes
in the market,
another box comes out
that becomes popular
at a lower price,
and all of a sudden
your inventory becomes
less valuable.
That's the risk
I see here.
I'm out.
I mean, we're here looking
for a partner, you know?
And at the end of the day,
like, that is --
Herjavec:
Well, you've got a partner.
Daymond's offered you
$500,000 for 25%...
-Of course, but we're also --
-...contingent on licensing.
We still haven't heard
from everybody yet.
Have a bigger round.
Not everybody --
I'd love to hear what...
-What are you doing, Mark?
...Mark and Lori have to say.
-The more Sharks drop out,
I become more valuable.
Um...
Cuban: Well, guys, let me help
carry things along here.
I rarely, rarely
ever discuss valuation, right?
Because if I think
a company's gonna grow,
it's all gonna wash out
long-term.
But you guys are really
at a very precarious point
right now, you know?
And that's what concerns me
more than anything,
because the worst thing
that can happen
to a start-up company is
to make a commitment
and not be able to live up
to it and fulfill.
And, yeah, you're going
out to raise money,
but you're desperate,
you know?
And you're not pricing like
you're desperate.
Well, to be honest, we haven't
even started with it.
This is the first place
we've came.
A lot of the times, you don't
just invest in the product.
You invest in the people.
Is the Coolbox the best idea
in the entire world?
Of course not.
There are, you know,
ideas all over the place.
Do we believe in it,
and do we believe it's a product
that we've put blood,
sweat, and tears into
for the last six months?
Yes, we do.
Have we had other companies
where we've struggled
and bounced our way
back up to the top
and kept the people
that are impressed with us
and invest with us happy?
Yes.
What's gonna make you
get involved, Mark?
Where are your lack
of confidences?
The lack of confidence is
there's nothing
that's protectable.
That's the part
that keeps me away
because you could be going
full speed ahead,
but then someone could
just knock you off,
and it's gone.
[ Snaps fingers ]
And that's my hesitancy.
I'm out.
Two Sharks left.
Now, the risk you have is
if Lori goes out,
Daymond may adjust his offer,
'cause he's greedy.
And so maybe
you should accept it now
before you find out the outcome
of what Lori's gonna do.
-I'm willing to take a risk.
-There's a fair amount of risk
right now in the Shark Tank.
-And I hope that maybe
hopefully they both like
each other,
and maybe they want
to work together.
Oh, you want to take
that gamble?
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.
Jason and Chris have
one offer on the table
from Daymond for their
high-tech toolbox, Coolbox.
But they have yet to hear
from Lori.
O'Leary: Now the risk
you have is if Lori goes out,
Daymond may adjust his offer,
'cause he's greedy.
Do you want to take
that gamble?
Do you want
to tighten up your offer
and give us a little bit
of a better valuation?
Neubauer: Or is there any way
to do it without, I mean --
I really not want an investment
tied on the licensing.
It's not
that I'm not open to it.
I just would not like that tied
to the investment.
Okay.
Take your chances with Lori.
Greiner: since "Shark Tank,"
I find that I am very heavily
in the hardware space,
unusually --
Scrub Daddy, ScreenMend,
FiberFix --
so I'm all over
Home Depot, Lowe's,
Ace, True Value,
these places.
So, this <i>can</i> fit
within my family
of entrepreneurs.
The thing -- I agree with
Daymond and the other Sharks.
We don't know yet
if the market's going
to pay that much money
for this.
So, for me
to give you an offer,
I feel I would need...
I would give you
the $500,000.
But I'd need a 30%.
-Ohh.
-Whoa.
-Good think you waited.
-Not contingent --
Not contingent on licensing.
-How about that power drill,
kids?
-But --
-I'd say it was deep.
-I feel --
I'm gonna make it contingent
on one thing.
It's that Lowe's,
for sure, is going
to be giving you
a purchase order.
Yeah.
All right, Chris, Jason,
you got two offers. Both
have a contingency.
I'm gonna recant
my offer.
I'm out.
-Whoa.
-Whoa.
Lori, let's go
$500,000 for 20%.
We have these sales
right now.
Through, like we telling you,
all these P.O.s.
And, again,
it's contingent upon that.
You can come
to the next meeting.
We'll go over to North Carolina
and meet with the buyer.
We'll check out
all the different spots...
Shh.
I'll give you $500,000
as a line of credit,
which is a loan,
at 5% interest,
and then I'll get
15% equity in the company.
Final offer?
Final offer.
Want to do it?
Let's do it.
Let's do it. We accept.
-Let's do it.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
That was a lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.
Oh, my God!
[ Laughter ]
-You guys are tough, man.
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Thank you so much.
-Congratulations, guys.
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Uh-huh.
[ Exhales sharply ]
All right, bud.
Good job.
Neubauer: I think
striking a deal with Lori
elevates us
to the next level.
I mean, there's certain things
in relationship experience
that we don't have,
and she just gives us
basically
that checkmark box
and validation of where we're at
and where we're going.
