Hi.
My name is Stephen Chen.
This here is Austin.
I am the founder of Petnostics,
and I'm here today
seeking $300,000 in exchange
for 10% of my company.
We all love our pets
like our children,
and it's important to monitor
their health regularly.
Unlike children, though,
our pets cannot talk to us.
And that's why I started
Petnostics.
Petnostics allows you to check
your pet's health instantly
by analyzing your dog
or cat's urine
with your smart phone.
So let's pretend that this
blue liquid is Austin's urine.
So, here we have Austin's sample
in the Petnostics cup,
which has a special lid
that's integrated
with the same
chemical test strips
that vets use
in their clinics.
Once you get your pet's urine
in our cup,
simply screw on the lid...
and flip the cup over.
These test pads
will then change colors
depending on your pet's health.
And out app will scan the cup
and analyze the color changes,
telling you
about possible health issues --
anything from diabetes
and urinary tract infections
to whether your pet
is properly hydrated.
Here you can see
the results of the test,
and you can easily save
and share with your vet.
With Petnostics,
at a fraction of the cost
of a vet visit
and from the comfort
of your own home,
you really can check
your pet's health instantly.
So, Sharks, Austin and I
would like to know if...
you're in.
Urine.
Get it?
[ Laughs ]
I have samples here
for you today,
and I'll be happy to answer
any questions you may have.
That is the cutest dog.
Good boy, Austin.
[ Laughter ]
You can grab one.
Thank you.
Hey, Austin!
Rescue dog?
-He is a rescue dog.
-Of course.
Hey.
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.
Stephen,
do you have the original IP?
Yeah.
So we have four issued patents
around this technology already,
and --
-What is the technology?
-On what?
So, on this
all-in-one embodiment
of the strip
and then this cup format,
and also, most importantly,
is the algorithm
that we use to color-calibrate
for the strip
and, um, the app
to recognize the colors.
Okay. But you're just taking
what's already available
-with the strips...
-Exactly.
...and then
you're simplifying it
to a consumer-friendly
product.
Our patents do cover,
um, a wide range of uses.
And so, you know,
a logical next extension
of this product
is in the human market.
Kutcher: To me, the biggest
barrier to entry on this thing
is collecting the sample
from the dog.
Like, I really don't
want to do that.
Now, I have two dogs.
If one of my dogs
is really sick,
I would -- I would actually
do this on behalf of my dog.
But I've seen things
in the human space
where you can take a blood
sample, really, really simple,
and I would think
on behalf of a pet,
it'd be a lot easier
to just give one little prick
on the pet,
take a tiny blood sample,
and do that test
than be underneath the dog,
trying to collect
a urine sample.
Vets don't generally do
the blood tests at home
because pet parents
don't like to prick
the animal or the pet
and get blood that way.
So, Stephen,
I'm still trying to understand
where the value add
to the consumer is.
Is it a cost saving
over going to a vet?
Initially, it is
proof of concept that we have.
We thought
the check-engine light
was gonna be
a very valuable proposition.
Well, the difference is
a check-engine light is passive.
Mm-hmm.
In your case,
there's got to be an action
that caused me to go
stick my hand under my dog
while he's peeing.
We realize that the impetus
to put it under
is if the vet tells you
to do so.
So it's vet-driven?
We definitely
want to go the vet route.
The problem is my vet
wants me to bring my animal in
as many times as I possibly can.
Yeah, yeah.
You have to do that, too, right?
Why's my vet gonna give me
this really convenient thing?
Say, "I don't
have to charge you anymore.
Here. Take this cup."
Yeah. See, I think
it's a consumer play.
Herjavec:
Look, I admire the fact
that you've sold 10,000.
I'm still amazed by that,
but I'm not sold
on the business model.
Vets want to make more money,
not less money.
I believe in this product,
but I also have to really
believe in a very clear
distribution channel.
Mm-hmm.
I think you're early.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
O'Leary:
Walks us through the numbers.
What's the revenue gonna be
for this calendar year?
Um, we're projecting $200,000
in sales this calendar year.
Okay, so you're not making
any money yet.
So, next year,
we're projecting, hopefully,
$400,000 in sales with these
new specific-disease tests.
That market makes up
590 million tests
that potentially can be done.
But it's not clear yet,
Stephen,
what the go-to-market
distribution strategy is.
We're talking about vets,
direct sales online,
maybe retail,
if you can find enough margin.
That's not clear yet.
These are all
to be determined, right?
Yes.
There's a bit of risk
in your deal
in terms of
what's gonna happen.
And you're a little
prerevenue-ish.
You know, what I love
about "Shark Tank" deals
is when it's already proven
what the channel's gonna work.
I pour $300,000 on it.
It's just like gasoline on fire.
It explodes.
You're not there yet.
Okay.
What are the -- You said there
were four patents that you had.
The patents cover
any specimen --
like, specific-use cases.
And so if it's the human market,
we can also do water testing,
milk and dairy testing.
There's a lot of different
applications --
But it's all strip --
But it's all strip --
It's all strip, yes.
That's the key, right?
I'm very involved
on the human side.
I've got investments
in a company called Biomeme
that does blood analysis.
My point is that being
strip-driven,
I think,
will have a life cycle.
I just don't see it
as a long-term life cycle.
I see that as a problem.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Kutcher: I think you have
something interesting,
and I think there's a market
for this.
And there are real channels
to get to pet owners
that care about their pets
that little bit more.
Mm-hmm.
My biggest concern
is still around
the very first question
that we had around collection.
I think
that you're gonna be disrupted
by a bunch
of other platforms
that can do the same thing
that you do
without the messiness
of having to do a urine sample.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
I thought Ashton
was going to make you an offer,
'cause you know, Ashton,
you can sell a lot
before somebody else comes out
with something better.
I think I can get this out there
to the consumer.
I try to skate
to where the puck is going,
not to where the puck is.
And I don't think that that's
where the puck is gonna be.
O'Leary: There's technology,
and then there's
distribution risk.
I'm more concerned
about distribution risk --
how you blow
this thing out
so you sell
a few million dollars of it.
I want to reflect that
in my offer.
I'll do the $300,000
for 15%.
Mm. Okay.
Herjavec: Interesting.
Wow.
Kutcher: You know, Kevin,
I've watched this show a lot.
Your deals
always have ratchets, levers,
you have the some royalties,
some plug-in hooking --
No, I'm really good
at that.
I'm the most creative shark
in structure.
Are you gonna ask him
why he likes this one?
You can call it creative.
I'm learning
what not to do.
I call it founder abuse,
but you can call it creative.
I'm really curious
about why you're offering
a straight equity deal
on this.
I do them occasionally,
but I think this is a play
on trying to figure out
which channel works
and then pouring
gasoline on it,
because at this point,
he doesn't even know
how he's gonna sell it.
So there's no point
in ratcheting anything.
There's nothing
to ratchet.
If there was, trust me,
I would do it.
I think it's interesting.
I like your four patents.
I've sold a lot of products
over the last 18 years.
And I have seen so many people
spend so much on their pets.
And they want to make sure
that they're okay.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
$300,000 for 20%.
I don't really see this
as a QVC television product.
Oh, QVC would crush it.
QVC would crush it.
Yeah, QVC, retail, online --
everything.
I think we all do that.
And you want him to pay
an extra 5% in equity for that?
That's not worth it.
I think I'm worth it.
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.
Stephen has two offers
on the table
for his pet-health indicator,
Petnostics.
You've got Lori --
$300,000 for 20%.
She's bringing QVC, retail,
all kinds of things.
She thinks she's worth
an extra 5%.
Kevin's in $300,000 at 15%.
What are you gonna do,
Stephen?
I know Lori
will bring the retail side.
Um, Kevin will really bring
the veterinary clinic side.
I will.
But I challenge you.
I want to do both.
I would do both, too,
though.
But, you know,
this queen of QVC thing,
I've got news.
I went on QVC recently.
-Oh, no.
You ready?
This is gonna hurt Lori
a little.
In 3 minutes and 40 seconds,
I sold $500,000 of wine.
I was crowned the king of QVC
that moment.
He crowned himself
the king of QVC.
No one has ever sold
that much wine ever
from a single brand
on QVC.
The point is, anybody can do QVC
and sell a lot of stuff.
What are you gonna do,
Stephen?
I guess, Lori,
can I ask you one question?
Would you consider
$300,000 for 15%?
Oh, equaling Kevin's offer,
Lori.
I feel, at 15%, you know,
as much as I really do love this
and I think it's a great product
and my thought would be --
Queen, come here for a second.
The king is speaking.
Ugh.
If you want to split the deal,
I'll do 50/50 for 20%.
20%.
This is because you didn't move
fast enough in some ways.
20%...
50/50 -- king and queen.
-You had 15%.
-20%...
Queen and joker.
It's the only offer
on the table now.
I'm in.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, man.
Good presentation.
And I get the dog.
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you so much.
-Good idea.
-Thank you so much.
Come on, Austin.
Let's go.
Cuban:
Good job, Austin.
-Congratulations, Stephen.
-Come on. Here we go.
-Good job, guys.
-Cute.
-Aww.
-Aww.
Here we go.
Come on.
Greiner: Aww,
that dog is the cutest.
I'm feeling good, I think.
To get a deal with Lori
and Kevin,
they both bring a good balance
in terms of where we want to go
and where we are seeing success
right now.
And so I am very, very happy
that we got a deal.
