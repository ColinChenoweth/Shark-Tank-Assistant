Sharks,
my name is Yashar Behzadi.
I'm the C.E.O. and co-founder
of popSLATE.
I'm here seeking $500,000
for 5% of my company.
With popSLATE,
we're gonna make you see
a whole new side
to your smartphone.
We all have one of these --
our most prized possession.
It's with us 24/7,
yet half the phone does nothing.
The back of the phone
is a tremendous piece
of real estate that's unclaimed
and that we want to own.
So, let me introduce you
to popSLATE.
popSLATE transforms
the back of your phone
into an always-on second screen.
Always on means
you have instant access
to what you want
when you want it.
Calendars, to-do lists,
recipes, maps, all at a glance.
It's never having
to fumble around anymore
for your boarding pass.
It's a 24/7 feed
of the information you want --
news or your favorite
sports scores.
With popSLATE, you can actually
customize your case instantly.
For me, I love popping
pictures of my son.
But this is just the beginning.
I need your help
to help grow the business
to get popSLATE on the back of
every single phone in the world.
So my question to you, Sharks,
is, who's in?
What happens
to the front of the screen?
So the front of the screen
is completely off,
and that's the beauty.
It saves you the hassle
of unlocking your phone,
digging around your apps
to get just a little bit
of information.
-Do we get samples?
-Yeah, absolutely.
It's not a dual screen?
I just want to be clear on that.
I can't have both on
at the same time?
Yes, you can.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
So we've customized those
for you.
There's Mr. Wonderful.
I like that.
Ashton, here.
So there's a button
on the side there.
If you hold down the button
for about a half a second,
it'll actually cycle
through images.
We've put
some of your favorite quotes
and some other images on there
for you guys.
How does it work?
Yeah, so it actually
is an e-paper screen,
so very much like you have
in your e-reader.
We've customized the screen
to make it super low power
and extra durable.
And it's connected wirelessly
to the phone via Bluetooth.
So you set up
that information
on the front-side application.
-That's right.
And then
the front-side application
delivers what you want
to the back side.
That's correct.
Tell me the biggest value point
to the consumer.
It saves you time, and we know
time is money, right?
So, for me,
when I'm running around my day
and just having
that basic information around
and being connected
is a huge saving for me.
And how much are you selling
each one for?
For $129 today.
And what's your cost
right now?
So the product you hold
in your hand today
-is about an $80 cost point.
-Wow.
But we have $41 quotes in hand
from the manufacturers
for volume production.
-$41?
-$41.
-And that's all in?
-That's all in, landed costs.
How much is the tooling
for each?
It's about $50,000
per tooling cycle.
So to tool up
for all the different phones
that are out there,
it's gonna be a lot of money.
That's right. So what we're
doing is focusing on iOS.
So luckily,
there's only two major models --
the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
How much money
have you lost,
and when do you think
you'll break even?
We've spent about $1.6 million
to date on the development.
When do you think
you'll break even?
We think we'll be
cash-flow-positive
in July of next year.
Herjavec:
I mean, I love technology.
I've been in the technology
business for a long time.
Sometimes I'm wildly right.
Sometimes I fall in love
with stuff and I'm wildly wrong.
It's very cool.
It's a beautiful design.
But I see this market moving,
actually, a different way.
I think where this is moving to
is a wearable technology.
We don't see it necessarily
competing with the wearables.
Wearables, I think,
have a different use case.
I think, for me,
the wearables are great
for small bits of information
like notifications,
things like that.
But this is a terrible
user experience.
Dick Tracy would argue
with you.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, for me,
I see it going to a wearable.
I'm out.
The lock screen is really
your competition, right?
Because it's becoming
more and more powerful.
Notifications
are getting a lot stronger,
people are using the lock
screens for more things.
The problem
is you need to come up
with something new, different,
and exciting,
and this has the potential
to be that.
You know, if all of a sudden,
15 people you know walked in
and, boom,
there comes their picture,
or you're scrolling
through their picture
because they're
in the same room,
that's something different,
new, and exciting, right?
Absolutely. And I think we can
build exactly on your point.
So I think the real
great advantage of this
is the screen's always on.
So within context,
you can update the screen
to serve information.
So whether it's at a Mavs game
and giving you
relevant information...
Yeah.
...or it's walking into a store
and getting a coupon
or an advertisement
that you transact with.
It's a land grab.
You have to win.
It's a very binary space.
O'Leary: It's a land grab
for the accessory.
So you're left with what's left.
That's what I'm hearing.
If they put on
their own second screen.
Well, I think we're going
in that direction.
I think we're definitely
heading in that direction.
The problem that we have
and the reason why nobody
goes with a second screen
is just battery life, right?
Right. But this has
a battery-life issue too.
It's one week,
it's an e-reader,
it's low battery...
-I get that, but --
...which makes
a lot of sense.
As we debate
his business plan,
'cause that's
what we're doing...
-Wait, I have a question.
-...I'm looking at it,
saying to myself,
"I'll give you $500,000.
I get 5%. I'm the smallest guy
in the cap table."
You're welcome to give more.
You get a bigger space.
I have to pay
the full pop valuation
while we're still debating
what the direction is
because we don't agree,
and that's okay,
but that also reflects
the amount of risk in this deal.
I'm gonna look at it
from that perspective.
I don't think the risk/reward
is there for me.
I'm out.
Okay. Great.
Thank you.
Greiner:
I have a question for you.
To Ashton's point, are you
trying to drive the price down?
Yeah, we want to be
lower priced,
and I think our sweet spot
will be probably about $99.
I've sold million of dollars
of cellphone cases --
purely decorative.
It's a great market,
and obviously one that's going
to be growing and growing.
The down part for me
was always that you're never
catching up, right?
Cellphones are constantly
getting bigger and bigger.
It's something
you're always chasing after
because just as you get
a lot of inventory in,
it's like one hit, and then
you've got to be changing again.
And the tooling,
as we've talked about,
is extremely expensive.
I'm out.
And I appreciate that.
You're very much right.
We're very early
in what we're trying to do.
You've got two sharks left.
Okay, I like this platform.
I think your software side
is probably the most compelling
thing to me
because of your capacity
to use Bluetooth
and actually broadcast
whatever you want to program
into your application.
But what I'm afraid of
is that you have a dependency
on Apple because
you're iOS-only right now.
I think your price point's
a little bit too high.
I just can't get over
those hurdles.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Great.
Thank you.
See, to me, as this becomes
more multi-window
and lock screen
becomes smarter,
iOS is just gonna
keep on improving,
I don't think your product
becomes as critical
or as compelling.
And so, for those reasons,
I'm out.
Man, you did a very good job
today of explaining.
No, I really, really
appreciate it.
I know it's a new space, so we
have a lot of work ahead of us.
But I thank you for your time.
It's been wonderful.
-Thank you very much.
-Great. Thank you, guys.
-Appreciate it. Thank you.
-Bye.
You know,
I'm a little disappointed
that I didn't get the money,
but the feedback was wonderful.
I think everybody
had really good ideas.
It's a new space,
it's a new product,
you know, I think we have
some things to figure out.
That's a damn
good-looking case.
Oh, my God.
