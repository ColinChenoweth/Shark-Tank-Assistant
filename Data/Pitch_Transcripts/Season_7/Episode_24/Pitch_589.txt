Hi. I'm Keir Dillon.
And I'm Sheen Moaleman.
Our company is Frends,
and we're seeking $1 million
in exchange
for 7.6% of our company.
Over the past decade,
headphones have evolved
from electronic devices to
lifestyle-defining accessories.
Yet, as an accessory, the design
language isn't fashionable.
Nothing that would excite
the female consumer
the same way a new handbag
or a stunning necklace could.
We set out
to create headphones
that would be more than
just a way to listen to music,
but a fashion accessory
that women would love to wear.
Update your look
with the simple twist of a cap.
Frends offers a collection
of interchangeable caps
that allow you to accessorize
your headphones
to reflect your personal style
and match your every mood.
Inspired from the runway,
a new collection of caps
is released each season,
so your Frends
will always stay on trend.
Sharks, if you know style
is deeper than clothes,
then you will love
your Frends.
And to prove it,
we've even got some samples
for you guys to check out
and listen
that I will pass out
right now.
So...
Thank you.
Very cool.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Greiner: Pretty.
What do you think?
They're really pretty.
How much are they?
We sell the smaller ones
for $150
and the larger ones
for $200.
Herjavec:
So, Keir, you've got a value
of roughly $12 million
on the company.
You must have a ton of sales.
Um, we have
a ton of demand.
And that's why we are here
meeting with you guys.
Sales and demand
are not the same thing.
Uh, last year we did
$2.9 million in sales.
We were on a target
for $6 million.
But distribution channels?
Nordstrom, Bloomingdales online,
Anthropologie online.
So, you did $2.9 million.
You thought you would do
$6 million.
What went wrong
or what happened?
When we first launched,
we were lucky to have
the two largest
consumer-electronic retailers
approach us and say,
"We want to carry you guys."
-Apple and Best Buy?
-Both.
This is back in 2012
that we launched.
What did you in 2013 when you
were in Apple and Best Buy?
$2.5 million.
How much did you make
on the $2.5 million you did?
We lost $1.3 million.
-You lost --
-So, you said --
Sorry, Lori.
You lost $1.3 million?
-Correct.
-Why?
So we shipped into Apple.
They had a hold-back clause.
So, you shipped in $2.4 million
worth of inventory.
So now all the capital
is exposed and you only get paid
on every single piece
that you have ticking through.
Was it a consignment deal?
Yes.
Consignment is inventory
goes on the wall.
You only get paid
when they get paid.
Correct.
-The rest comes back.
-Correct.
-Bad outcome.
-How did you absorb that loss?
We've been doing
convertible note since.
And how much
have you raised?
Uh, $1.5 million
of convertible notes.
Once we got that product back,
that was pretty much
end-of-life goods
that we still sold out
through different --
So, you don't have it sitting
in the warehouse anymore?
No, it's all been allocated.
And we're constantly selling out
through our retailers
and even
on our e-commerce site.
Whatever we have is always gone.
So you can't keep up
with the demand...
-Exactly.
-...is what you're saying?
Cuban:
Let's just talk year to date.
Give us the picture there.
So, year to date,
uh, to April, $850,000.
And you're on track to do
about $2 million in revenue.
We're on track to do
$8.7 million this year.
Wait, so you think
your Christmas,
you're gonna have
a hockey stick in Christmas
and just go nuts?
-Correct.
How much did you do
last Christmas?
Uh, $1.2 million.
Okay, so $1.2 million
in a Christmas season.
And you think
that you're gonna do $6 million
this Christmas season?
-Correct.
Why?
Uh, we're launching
into, um,
mass fashion
with the new piece.
Well, where is it?
Are you gonna show it to us?
-Is that here?
-We have a sample here.
Oh, it's Bluetooth.
Moaleman:
It's 100% Bluetooth.
So, this is the controllers here
with the microphone.
Where are the earbuds?
The earbuds will be hanging
from the back?
Oh, I see.
Oh, I see.
It's cool.
It's an interesting
piece of, uh...
So, it's a necklace
that plays music.
Correct.
How much is the necklace
going to cost?
It's between
$300 and $500.
-Wow.
-$300 and $500 to the consumer.
That's expensive.
But what does it cost you?
$60.
Wow.
That's crazy.
So, your anticipation
around your lift
is around selling
that new product?
Part of it is, yeah.
But a lot of it is actually
just our normal distributions.
50% of our domestic sales
are still coming from our core.
Next year's sales --
What will they be
in your most
optimistic scenario?
$34 million.
-Okay.
-That's pretty optimistic.
I'm letting you
be optimistic.
Yes.
You have to put
a lot of steroids into this
to get it
to anything near that.
But anyways, what are you gonna
generate in free cash off that?
Um, $3 million,
but that's because
we're investing
all money back in.
You're a cockroach
in this space. Sorry.
In case
you didn't know that.
I know.
It's why we're here.
Very small.
Can you just give me
a simple number?
How much money
have you lost since inception?
$9 million.
-You've lost $9 million?
-Lost?
Wow.
I smell a scenario where you
go to zero, you know that?
I don't smell that,
but I appreciate that.
You're gonna run out of cash.
You're telling me
that you're gonna go
from $2.9 million
to $34 million in 12 months.
Yeah.
I'm out.
Kutcher: You know what?
I think you actually have
something pretty cool.
I think you're in
a really crowded space.
Your product is good,
but the problem is, the way
you explain your company,
it makes it seem like you
don't have your stuff together.
And I feel like
you're hiding something.
I don't know what it is.
But when I get that instinct,
I step out.
So I'm gonna pass.
I'm out.
Respect that.
I think, you know,
they look very nice.
But the problem for me
is I don't have confidence
in the way you're running
the business at all.
You've had a lot of issues
and you've lost a lot of money.
And I can't invest
in a company like that.
I'm out.
Yeah, they look nice,
but I don't know
if there's a big market,
especially at that price.
But you lost $9 million,
and you're still not
out of the woods.
And then your projection
to go to $34 million next year
would be astronomical
in that period of time.
I'm out.
Look, put aside
the losses, right?
That's not unusual in
a start-up company,
particularly
consumer electronics,
particularly
where you've had to pivot.
But from an investment
perspective,
it really comes down to
a million-dollar bet
on this, right?
Because this is gonna be
the foundation
for your 60% sales
in Christmas.
But it's just a singular bet.
And that's the part
I'm not comfortable with,
particularly
on the valuation.
And so I'm just
not convinced.
For those reasons, I'm out.
Thanks a lot, guys.
-Thanks.
-Appreciate it.
Thank you.
