Kutcher: Uh, Steve,
can I ask you a question?
Yes.
How do you capture
the urine sample?
[ Laughs ]
That's a good question.
That's a very good question.
So, pet parents know that pets
relieve themselves on schedule.
So for me and Austin,
when I'm walking him,
I know
when he's about to pee.
I just get the cup behind him,
and I'm able to get the sample
that way.
You have to have the cup
under your dog
and letting your dog piss
in your hand and the cup
to capture the sample?
They give you a glove.
-[ Laughs ]
-For pet parents that have
a little bit more trouble
collecting the urine,
we have the Petnostics
Urine Collector.
[ Laughter ]
It's a little ladle
with an extendable handle.
Cuban:
It's like a selfie stick.
So, for female dogs or --
Yeah.
And so when Austin --
If there's a female dog
and they squat,
you can just kind of, you know,
get underneath there...
-[ Groans ]
-...and get the urine that way.
How much do you actually need
to capture
for the diagnostics to work?
Just a little teeny bit, yeah,
for the strips to change color.
What does it cost the consumer
to do all this stuff
and get all the paraphernalia
for pee collection?
We retail the cups for $10.
What does it cost you?
It costs me $2 right now
to make one of these.
How low do you think
you could get it at volume?
Um, we think we can get our cost
down to about 90 cents.
It's a one-time lab, right?
-It's a one-time-use cup.
-Okay.
How many cups have you sold
and to how many customers?
So, cups,
we've sold about 10,000 cups.
-What?
-Well, in what period of time?
-When did you start?
-We started in April 2014.
How have you sold?
So, we've sold right now
just through our website
and through local retail stores
in Southern California.
That's very impressive.
And so the leading vets,
they liken our product
to a check-engine light.
You know, seeing,
oh, there's something wrong,
potentially, under the hood,
then you still
have to have the expert,
the vet, take care of it.
What's your background?
What did you do
before you did this?
So, um,
I did industrial engineering
at the University of Michigan,
and I got my MBA from Harvard.
My name is Steve Watts.
And I'm his fiancée,
Angela Ferendo.
We live in Monarch Beach,
California.
And we are the founders
of Slyde Handboards.
I grew up in South Africa.
There's a huge surfing culture
over there.
As kids, we used to use
absolutely everything
to ride waves.
A lot of people look up
to surfers and want to be one,
but they don't have the time,
ability, or funds
to be able to do it.
Handboarding gives you
the thrill of surfing
without all the hassle.
Do they get a bicep leash,
as well?
Um...yep.
We're at a make-it-or-break-it
point for Slyde.
We've racked up
credit-card debt
and we've borrowed money
from friends and family.
The biggest thing is we took
all of our wedding money
that we had
and put it into the business.
If we don't get an investment
from the Sharks,
we won't be able
to get married,
we won't be able to fund
our inventory.
So, literally,
everything is riding on this.
We believe if we get a Shark
on board,
we can jump-start our business
and our life together.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Angela Ferendo.
And this is my fiancé,
Steve Watts.
We are co-owners
of Slyde Handboards.
We are asking for $200,000
for 15% of our company.
Watts:
So, when I was a little kid,
my mom used to take us down
to beach for the day.
And when we were down there,
we would literally try to find
anything that we could ride
a wave with,
from broken surfboards
to Frisbees,
even our flip-flops.
But our favorite
was the fast-food tray.
It wasn't until I started
traveling around the world
that I met other surfers
that did exactly the same thing.
And that's why
I started Slyde.
Wave-riding boards
that literally fit
in the palm of your hand.
Now we're gonna show you
a video so you can see
sliders all over the world
having fun
on their Slyde handboard.
Angela, how much money
did you put in
when you started
the business?
We're supposed to get married
in September.
My mom had $10,000 that
she saved up for our wedding.
Actually, these boards
that you see in front of you,
-we just got.
-This is our wedding.
So, instead of the wedding,
you bought the boards?
-Yeah.
-That's committing.
So, I made an investment
in a company called Handboards.
-Yes.
And so one
of the distribution channels
we spent a lot of time with
was these independent,
very cool surf shops.
We hired a rep,
we went to distribution...
-Yeah.
-You know.
-It's tough.
-Yeah.
We're gonna be old and gray
by the time we make
any real money doing that.
Tell me your idea.
How do you blow this up quickly?
So, our plan
is to focus first
on those specialty surf --
surf stores.
Why aren't you talking
to a Target, a Walmart?
We have just recently
sent to Target.
We are -- You know,
we have to educate first.
O'Leary: Right.
I mean, we need to put --
We need the merchandising
to support the sales.
People don't know
what it is.
Greiner: Well, listen.
I think it seems
like a lot of fun,
but I don't think I'm probably
the right partner for you.
Okay.
And so, for that reason,
I'm out.
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.
Well, thank you so much.
O'Leary:
Your numbers are small.
They're small.
I mean, you're just starting
your distribution journey.
I admire that you, um,
took all of your wedding money
and put it into inventory.
It's what you got to do.
That takes a certain
surfer attitude. I get it.
But it's not for me.
But I will tell you
one thing.
I'm gonna disclose
something to you
that's very important
for this moment.
Oh, no.
I'm actually now licensed
to marry people.
-[ Laughs ]
-Oh.
And I'm willing to perform
your wedding
right here
in the Shark Tank.
And so, if you two are ready,
let's do it right now.
You may not have a deal,
but you'll leave married.
Which is just as good to me.
Yeah. Um...
I'm out, guys.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
We really appreciate it.
How does your, um,
revenue break down?
More higher-end,
athletic surfers or kids?
We are 23- to 35-year-old,
mostly men.
We also have a lot of
ambassadors that are the groms.
They're the 13-year-olds
to 16-year-olds
that are, like,
really pushing the sport.
But that's my question,
really.
The more athletic
you have to be,
the higher end,
the smaller the market, right?
Right.
The more general --
So, if that was a picture
of an 8-year-old with a smile
on a little wave,
then, all of a sudden,
it becomes a surfer starter kit.
Here's the other reason I ask.
One of my "Shark Tank" companies
is Tower Paddle Board.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And they came in doing $40,000
in sales.
They'll do at least $8 million,
if not $10 million, this year.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
They do not only stand-up
paddleboards,
but they do surfboards,
as well.
We're looking
for ancillary products, right?
But if it's a very,
you know, niche product,
that doesn't help them.
Kutcher:
I think that this is, like,
this sort of minimalist approach
to going and catching a wave.
Absolutely. Yeah.
You got it.
I've lugged a surfboard
out on the water,
and it's a pain
and it's heavy.
And sometimes
you're just out there
and you want to just go
in the water really quick
and grab something
and then catch a couple waves
really, really fast.
And I think this solves
that problem.
I think the biggest trick is
the balance of,
how do you get into those bigger
stores to get those sales
to that broader audience
and keep your edge?
Yeah.
And that's all about
your brand, Slyde.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
I just think if you go
too wide too soon,
there's a danger
it's not cool.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not opposed to going wide
and making a lot of money.
No, no. I want to go wide
and make a lot of money,
but it's just --
It really is, I think,
just about, uh, like, being
careful about how you do it.
This is so not my space.
Okay?
I'm from Iowa.
I'm like a farm kid, all right?
I have zero experience
in getting things like this
to market.
Uh, I have a really,
really large
online distribution channel
that can help market things
and do it
with the right voice.
So I would need a partner.
And if Mark would be willing
to partner with me...
-Absolutely.
-...on the deal...
I could take it
into Tower Paddle Board.
They have the infrastructure,
they have the media.
You'd walk in
right into a huge customer base.
I'd be willing
to do the deal $200,000
for 25% of the company
and split it with him.
-Yep.
-Okay.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
What's your thought
on that offer?
We don't really want to go
above 20%
because this
is all we have.
This is our future, this is --
We put everything in it.
And now you have help.
Mark's idea
about distribution online...
Yep.
...we have a pipeline
that we can market this to
online, right?
You're actually doing
direct consumer marketing.
We can target demographics
on Facebook.
I mean, I can target
like right down to the age range
that you'd want to nail --
-Your groms...
-Yeah.
...I can nail them,
like, direct on.
And I can help you build out
a Facebook marketing strategy
on your online retail
in a way that nobody can do.
If you walk away,
you're gonna think to yourself,
"Golly, that 5%,
was it really that important?"
Narrator:
Two sharks are out.
Steve and Angela
have one offer on the table --
$200,000 for 25%
from Mark and Ashton
for their handboard company,
Slyde.
We don't really want to go
above 20%.
If you walk away,
you're gonna think to yourself,
"Golly, that 5%,
was it really that important?"
Do you want to hear
if he has an offer or not?
In life, sometimes looking
at options is not a bad idea.
We're talking about 5%.
We know.
We understand.
Robert, are you there at 20%?
That's the question.
I've made a lot of mistakes
with Handboards.
We've painfully learned
the market.
You've got to build
with the right stores,
you've got to be authentic,
and then you go wide.
He hasn't learned
from his mistakes.
-When we --
-5% --
-Let's hear his offer.
-5% is a lot to give up,
because over time, it's gonna
be worth a lot of money.
This is cool
'cause you're cool.
Ashton,
let him get his offer out.
This is cool.
Why would I want him
to get his offer out?
Your counter
was $200,000 for 20%.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, guys, while he's deciding,
let me just say this.
It's not about 5%.
You're getting
Tower Paddle Board,
you're getting me,
and you're getting Ashton.
And you're arguing
about 5%?
You keep saying
let him get his offer out,
but he keeps ho-humming
on his offer.
I just don't think
this is an add-on product
to Tower Paddle Boards.
-It's not an add-on product.
-It's a key product.
-It's not an add-on product.
-Exactly. Thank you.
Slyde is a product
in and of itself.
But why not use the resources
of an existing asset...
That has the distribution.
We're one of 20 partners
on Amazon
that get front-page
presentation.
You're not saying
that we have to do that, right?
No.
You'll have your choice, right?
It's your call.
You can get the help or you
can get the sales support.
This is getting
really frustrating.
Here's what I'll do
for you.
I'll do the $200,000 for 15%,
which is what you offered,
and I'll marry you.
'Cause I'm tired
of listening to this.
Right, because this
is your brand,
all day, right here.
That's your brand all day long.
You need money
to do your own thing.
Angela, I'll give you
the $200,000 for 15%.
So, Angela, You have
three offers on the table.
What are you going to do?
Okay.
We value everyone here so much.
This is our third year
trying to get on the show.
-Wow.
-Third time lucky.
Third time.
So, we know, though,
that having more than one Shark
means a lot.
So...
Mark and Ashton,
if you will do 20%,
you have a deal.
Make it 22%
and you have a deal.
-Done.
-Deal.
-Done.
-Done.
[ Sighs, laughs ]
-Deal.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Congrats, big guy.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
-This is a great deal.
-It's exciting.
-I'm so excited.
-This is awesome.
-We are, too.
This is amazing,
and the design is incredible.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
It's gonna be exciting.
It's gonna be exciting.
I will not marry you.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my God.
That's who we wanted.
? I like to win,
I like to win ?
? I like to win,
I like to win ?
