I'm Oliver.
And I'm Sam.
And we're best friends
and business partners
from Denver, Colorado.
We're high school freshmen,
and we've been friends
since preschool.
Sam, what do you think
about this?
I like it.
Oliver: Our moms and dads
are entrepreneurs,
and they've always encouraged us
to think and tinker and invent,
and it's just
really in our blood.
Sam:
One day, Oliver and I
were enjoying one
of our favorite treats,
and an idea came to us --
a solution
to solve a very sticky problem.
Let's make sure
we got the consistency right.
We worked
in my mom's kitchen
to figure out the perfect
mixes and measurements
to make
the best prototype.
Oliver: All right.
Time to bake.
All right.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Sam Nassif.
And I'm Oliver Greenwald.
Oliver: Our parents
have always told us
you only get one chance to
make a great first impression.
I think we need
a little bit more energy there.
Show our confidence...
Yeah.
...and make sure they get
we mean business.
Oliver:
We've been practicing our pitch
every chance we can get.
We just want to walk
into the Tank really prepared.
Sam: We really know
that we've got a great product
that we can license
to a big manufacturer.
And with a Shark on our team,
we'll be "dripping" with cash.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Sam Nassif.
And I'm Oliver Greenwald.
We're both
from Denver, Colorado,
and our company
is the Drip Drop.
made out of the same ingredients
as the cone.
You see this?
There's a hole in the middle.
And you slide it
up the ice cream cone like this.
It fits perfectly
and catches all the drips
from your melting ice cream.
It's that easy.
You lick it, eat it, boom!
[ Laughs ]
And take your pick
from many delicious flavors
such as sugar cone...
A classic.
...or chocolate-covered.
Mmm, tasty.
Sharks, we need
your money and advice
to help get the Drip Drop
in every ice cream store
and every mouth
in the world.
Now, don't worry,
Mr. Wonderful.
No one's gonna steal
our cool, new product...
'cause it's
securely patented.
Cuban: Yeah.
Whoo-hoo.
Oliver: That's right.
We may not have driver's
licenses, but we have a patent.
[ Laughter ]
This baby's
a chick magnet.
[ Laughter continues ]
That's awesome.
Oh, that's good.
Sharks,
Drip Drop is simple,
it solves a real problem,
it's environmentally friendly,
it's patented,
and it sure is catchy.
Badum-ch!
Dude, come on.
We can do better than that.
Let me try.
Ice cream drip!
Both:
We scream drop!
And now, Sharks, you can scream
for the Drip Drop.
So, who wants
some ice cream?
We've got
all your favorite flavors.
Yeah.
Cuban: Bring it.
Nice job.
Very well done, guys.
Thank you, Oliver.
Yeah.
-So this is for Lori.
-Ladies first.
Corcoran:
I love coffee.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Smart.
So clever.
So, guys, I got to know.
What was going on
when you came up with it?
Well, three years ago,
when we were in fifth grade,
we were 10 years old.
We entered the Gates Invention
Competition at our school.
And so they challenged us
to solve a problem.
So, one day Oliver and I were,
uh, going to an ice cream store,
and we happened to see
this little boy.
He had drips
all over his hands and clothes,
and his mom was desperately
trying to clean him up
with tons of napkins.
And so we thought
there had to be a better way.
And we knew it had to be edible
and, uh, it had to be fun.
So that's how
we created the Drip Drop.
And we actually got second
in the competition,
and we also got a patent nod,
which was the best part.
The school offered
to pay for our patents.
That's fantastic.
What's your --
What's your patent on?
Basically covers the --
the shape and the size and --
A design patent.
Greiner: It's a utility patent
or a design patent?
It's a design patent,
yeah.
So, what have you
done with it?
Have you gone to sell it
to anybody?
Have you shown it to any of the
big ice cream makers or stores?
Yeah, so we went and talked to
a lot of food-industry experts,
and they all told us
that the best way
to go to market with Drip Drop
would be
to license our patent
to an ice cream cone
manufacturer.
And, uh -- And this reason
is because
the ice cream cone manufacturers
already have the customers,
already have
the ice cream store connections,
and already make products
with the same ingredients.
You are smart guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, did you go
see any people?
So, our parents
always tell us
that you only get one chance to
make a great first impression,
which is why we want
to create the strongest pitch to
an ice cream cone manufacturer,
which is sort of
why we need you, Sharks,
to open a couple doors
and negotiate a -- a meeting.
So, how do you guys make
your prototypes, your samples?
Yeah,
so that was actually
one of our biggest challenges
along the way
Sam,
I have a problem here.
Your Drip Drop
is dripping like crazy.
It's coming off the edge.
O'Leary:
It's on an angle, though.
Like -- Like we've said,
You'd raise the lip
a little bit.
Oliver: Yeah.
And that's -- And that's where
we want to use some of the money
is to hire a food engineer
to sort of help it cinch up
on the cone the best
and look -- look the best
and help the functionality.
Herjavec:
Well, you know what?
I'll -- I'll give you
this credit.
You came out here.
You're 14 years old.
The key
is really the patent.
Yeah.
Because I think it's not
something you're gonna sell
to individual
ice cream stores.
You have to --
Cuban:
Well, I would disagree.
I would take them
to the ice cream stores
and give it to them
initially for free
so they'd want more,
you know?
So, what, Mark,
You got on "Shark Tank."
Oliver: Yeah.
You can pick up the phone
and make that call
or write an e-mail
and get in front of them.
Yeah, I mean, we just want a
high-profile Shark like you guys
just behind our back.
It's great to have a Shark
on your team,
but it's too early.
It's just not for me.
Okay.
I'm out.
Both: Thank you.
What's remarkable
about this product,
it's sort of timeless.
In 100 years from now,
the ice cream cone will
still be the ice cream cone.
So maybe the strategy
for you guys
is to finish high school
and then run this ring
of ice cream-stopping-dripping
technology, you know?
If that's what you want to do
by the time you get there.
Meanwhile,
you still own the patent.
That's what's unique
about this.
Um, the --
the work involved
in getting a large manufacturer
to take this on
is a fair amount of work.
I mean, it's --
even for a Shark.
They'll return our calls,
but we still got to do the work.
So while
you're in school,
Everybody said
the same thing.
I don't want
to take on the work.
I've got a full-time job
and then some.
Guys, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
But I think I'm gonna get
Barbara to give you $50,000.
I'm not so sure
about that.
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.
Barbara and Lori
are Sam and Oliver's last chance
for a deal for their ice cream
cone accessory company,
the Drip Drop.
You've got a lot of things wrong
with the business, I think.
So I'll just
give you the list.
Um, I don't think
it's a licensing deal.
I think it's an upsell
at the ice cream store.
And I think you have to go out
and sell it yourself.
That's what I think.
However, I think
you have a faulty design here.
I don't think
it looks pretty enough.
I tell you the way
to make it look really pretty --
a lot of chocolate,
a lot of sprinkles.
But even
the shape of it --
This one looks pretty.
All the good stuff,
right?
Yeah, I mean, that's --
that's what we have up here.
That's what looks great to me
up there.
I love the concept.
I think it's great.
I think it's a licensing play
because I think
you could go to one
of the big manufacturers...
Herjavec: Me, too.
...and they could distribute
when they sell their cones
to all the different
ice cream stores.
Have them do the work.
You've got the patent.
I'm not going to give you
the $50,000
because I don't want
to take 20%.
I think that you can get
on the phone, get to somebody,
have them license it,
and then keep it all.
So for that reason, I'm out.
But I wish you good luck.
Thank you.
Great idea.
And -- And for Barbara,
just -- just one thing
I want to say
is that, I mean, we're --
we're two feisty kids.
We're gonna bring this to the --
to the edge of the world.
[ Laughs ]
We're gonna make this
the biggest thing it
could possibly be.
And one thing that you're --
you're showing
to all the kids in America
by investing in us
is that dreams really do
come true, and that, uh...
Oh, you're schmoozing us now,
aren't you, sir?
I like it!
I mean, if you think we should
go for a different approach,
I mean, we're really willing
to do whatever you think --
You know, I just think there's
two faults to the product.
One is it doesn't
look cute enough.
It needs a rippled edge
like that...
Mm-hmm.
And we can make that happen.
...like a doily.
Doesn't sound good,
Oliver.
I don't like
the look on your face.
You have a deal.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Good card player!
Yay, Barb.
Whoo! Whoo!
Together:
[ Chanting ] Barbara, Barbara,
Barbara, Barbara, Barbara.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you so much.
Aww.
I'm gonna marry you both
when you're 20.
Greiner:
Congratulations, guys.
Congratulations, guys.
Oliver: Thank you.
You won't regret it.
Sam:
A deal with a Shark
is gonna help our school cred
enormously.
Yeah, I mean, ma--
maybe even Barbara
will pay us a visit
to our high school.
[ Laughs ]
We'll get a lot of attention
from the ladies.
To be able to replicate
the same concept that we
have here in stores,
it feels pretty unbelievable
to walk in
and see our products
hanging in stores.
And I have to say, I think we
delivered upon our contingency.
Narrator:
Next up are entrepreneurs
who believe they have
a lucrative spectacle
for the Sharks.
Tonight,
we've brought a small sample
of our new show,
"Miracles."
Ooh!
[ Soft music plays ]
Lori, we have six different
colored handkerchiefs.
Pick a number
between one and six.
Three.
One, two, three.
The red handkerchief.
Thank you.
Sharks,
for the next 15 seconds,
whatever you do...
Don't leave your seats.
[ Chuckles ]
-Now, that's magic.
-It is magic.
[ Laughter ]
[ Upbeat music plays ]
Whoa!
Oh, my God.
[ Laughs ]
Go!
[ All gasp ]
-Bam!
-Oh, wow.
-Whoa.
-Weird.
And that's a small sample
of our show, "Miracles."
Do you have
a venue secured?
You guys
are in the same boat.
It's just
so difficult to do.
Otherwise,
you would have already done it.
I'm out.
Corcoran:
It's such a wild bet
as to whether you'll succeed
or not on the money side.
Just seems to me so scary
and with very little control.
That was
my same experience.
My wife and I spent
a lot of time together running.
Will,
is that a real child?
Yeah, this Sophie.
She's 3 1/2 years old.
Can I run with her?
Absolutely.
Run around.
So, Sharks, what I brought today
is a MyDrinky sample.
And then I also brought
some Orbit Labels,
which is the first product
that I invented,
'cause we're not
a one-product company.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
If you want to grab
three things.
Here,
I'll give Lori hers.
She has
a hard time getting there.
Greiner: Thank you.
He's such a gentleman.
Oh, good. Purple.
Here's a baby bottle
for you.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
Here you go,
Mr. Wonderful.
and you're gonna press both
nose buttons at the same time...
Oh, I see.
...and pull the top off.
Okay, and then?
Then, you're gonna place
the juice box into the base.
Okay.
Place it back down
onto the base.
It's just a holder.
Yes, it's holder
so kids can't squeeze
those juice boxes and pouches.
Clever.
What did you expect?
[ Laughs ]
-What were you doing?
-Well, lookit.
She turned it upside down
like the straw wasn't gonna --
-[ Gasps ]
-Most kids will think of that.
-Yes, and that's --
-So what?
The parents
are gonna try to stop them.
She's bored after 10 years
of doing the same old thing.
O'Leary: You know, there's
nothing -- You're right.
She's bored, and now she's gonna
go blow a million bucks.
