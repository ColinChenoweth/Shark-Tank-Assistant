Raja: Whatever you do,
don't leave your seats.
Narrator: If the Sharks hear
a great idea...
Whoa!
...they'll invest
their own money...
I think
it's a licensing play.
I think it's an upsell.
...and fight each other
for a deal.
You're the real deal.
Corcoran:
That's an offer from a pig.
Will you shut up,
Barbara?
He's nuts.
She actually isn't
very good with numbers.
Narrator: The entrepreneurs
must get the full amount
I'm Jarrett.
I'm Raja.
And together...
Both:
We're Jarrett and Raja.
We're based
in Las Vegas, Nevada.
And our company is
Jarrett and Raja Productions --
a music magic company.
Jarrett, if you do it
with Barbara,
I'll give you
the $750,000.

Jarrett:
Come on, join our show.
That was great.
Thank you.
That was really cool.
Thank you.
Raja:
Excellent question.
In Las Vegas, the casinos now
rent you the show room.
It is no longer the days
of paying you a salary, a fee.
They are the landlord.
It is up to the headliner
to come in with a full team,
do the marketing,
advertising,
everything
to put butts in seats.
Everything.
So, that's why
we are here today.
O'Leary: So, basically...
the risk is that it sucks
and nobody comes
and I lose $750,000.
It doesn't have to suck.
No, no, no.
I mean, it could be...
Your risk is that your show
could actually be a big success
but your costs
go out of hand...
Correct.
...and you have to
put more money into it.
There's been lots of shows
that did very well in Vegas,
but the cost went "boom."
What you're saying
is true, but --
But do you have a venue?
I'm curious.
Yeah, we're in discussions
with a venue right now.
But you need to come fully
funded before you come to them.
We are in discussions,
and the president of the hotel
is interested,
which is wonderful.
We have
an opportunity...
As long
as you pay the rent.
As long
as you pay the rent.
Exactly.
How many
does the room seat?
Generally, it seats 1,600
in this particular theater.
How much could we get
per ticket?
Tickets are $59.95
general admission.
How many shows a day?
One show a day.
What?
Why can't you guys
do two shows?
Oh, we can.
'Cause it's hard
to do the sales.
Jarrett: We can.
It's up to
if the property wants it or not.
You could drink a lot of coffee
and do three shows a day.
Well, but they also have to
fill it three times a day.
You can't sell
that many tickets.
You don't want
to have an empty room.
How many other magic acts
are there in Vegas right now?
There are
11 other magic acts.
Herjavec:
From what I understand,
in the last 12 months,
the average age of people
going to Vegas has gone down.
The most popular venue
right now
is the nightclubs
and the beach clubs.
Right.
So it's a younger demographic
going to Vegas.
Jarrett: It is.
Which is
part of the reason
why the casinos are not
willing to invest in shows
because they're not drawing in
the people like they used to.
How are you gonna get
people to come in?
Well, that's marketing.
I -- You know, it's --
it's the power of the billboards
and the cab backs and really --
So, you're gonna do like
everybody else does it.
That's expensive.
Here's the challenge.
Great act.
Thank you.
There's
11 other of other acts.
I'm going to Vegas.
I'm sitting in my hotel room.
I see a flyer.
Right.
How is it different?
'Cause you know
people in Vegas
are bombarded
with entertainment.
Yep.
Why is yours different?
You know, Robert,
our goal, really,
is to be the
next Siegfried and Roy.
I hate to be tacky
about that, but...
That's not tacky.
That's dreaming.
That's our -- That's our dream.
That's our goal.
That's our vision.
It's great to dream.
Out of all the new acts
launched every year in Vegas,
how many are successful
and how many fail?
That's a good question,
Robert.
And, you know, it depends
on the genre of the show,
the type of the show.
-That's what I was gonna say.
-It really does.
In your performance,
you'll see a graph of
the different shows...
I'm gonna say
it's pretty low.
But -- But...
I'm gonna say
it's pretty low.
It's probably like Broadway
shows or any other genre.
Cuban:
All right, guys. I agree.
It's a great show, right?
I mean -- And obviously,
you've had success doing it.
And now it's time
for your big break.
That's what you're hoping for.
I get that.
But having produced
a lot of movies,
it's hard to translate
great movies
into getting people
to go to the show.
