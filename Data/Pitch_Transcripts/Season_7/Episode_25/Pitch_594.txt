they're asking for, or they'll
walk away with nothing.
We have a patent.
This baby's a chick magnet.
[ Laughs ]
This is a go-to-market
investment opportunity.
This is a prototype.
Oh, my God.
Have you ever played
in the retail space?
No, that's why
I need a partner.
This is a critical moment.
Well, how are you
gonna help me?
Narrator:
Who are the Sharks?
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist
who made his fortune
selling a children's
educational company
for over $4 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went
from waiting tables in Manhattan
to building the city's premier
$2 billion real-estate empire.
Robert Herjavec, son of
an immigrant factory worker,
founded one of
the world's preeminent
cyber-security firms.
Lori Greiner, the Queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents
and has launched
more than 400 products,
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in sales.
And Mark Cuban,
esteemed billionaire tech mogul
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.
We're seeking $50,000 in
exchange for 20% of our company.
Sharks, everyone loves
eating ice cream.
But there's
a universal problem.
When ice cream melts down
the side of a cone,
you get messy drips all over
your hands and clothes,
and you have to waste
tons of napkins wiping it up.
We knew there had to be
a better way.
That's why we created
the Drip Drop.
Drip Drop is
an edible, useful,
and environmentally friendly
add-on
to the traditional
ice cream cone.
It's such
a simple solution.
Only kids
could have invented this.
It's an edible ring
is making the prototypes.
So we had to start with
a 3-D model of our Drip Drop,
and from there we turned that
into a silicone mold,
which we make
homemade batter
and pour that
into the silicone mold.
And then we just pop them
in the toaster over,
and out comes Drip Drops.
What's it cost you to make it?
What are you selling it for?
We've estimated
that the Drip Drop
will cost the ice cream cone
manufacturers
about 3.2 cents to make.
And then they'll sell that
to the ice cream stores
for about 10 cents.
How much does a cone cost?
A cone costs
about 5 cents.
So, do you think
it's a problem
that you're almost doubling
the price of the cone?
Well...
no, because, um,
I think there's a real need
for the kids and their parents,
so I think they're gonna pay
an extra quarter for it.
And it's also --
There's, um...
the need for grown-ups who just
want an extra cookie treat
at the end
of their ice cream, so...
[ Laughs ] More food.
I would put whipped cream on it,
then more sprinkles...
[ Laughter ]
...and make it
even bigger.
Chocolate chips.
Corcoran: Second layer.
Oh, my God. I'm a pig.
I would eat it all.
we're just making these at home
as prototypes,
so, obviously, if we went
to a manufacturer,
we would make sure
that the design is perfect
and catches all the drips.
by the time they're 30,
they're making money on it?
No, no.
If there's
a bunch of people using them
and everybody's seeing them,
then you start creating demand
and you get more feedback
and you learn.
And then, you know,
once they came back for more,
you can start
charging them.
Okay.
And then
it builds from there.
You don't need to make it
perfect, all right?
You just got to get
people using it and learn.
Yeah.
But while I think it's gonna be
a great opportunity,
it's gonna take
a lot of time.
Yeah.
It's gonna take
a lot of work,
particularly
with you guys in school.
I'm gonna have to say
I'm out.
Both: All right.
Thank you so much.
Hey, guys, I completely disagree
with his strategy.
There's only one path.
You got to go
to the large manufacturers.
They got to license it.
It comes down to a patent.
There's no demand,
there's no need for a license.
That's not true.
You...
That's how
you're gonna make money.
Selling at one ice cream store
at a time,
I mean, that's
a little hobby business.
I think you guys
are really smart guys.
It's very, very clever.
Don't sell yourself short
about your ability
to call those big companies.
Okay.
All right?
I mean,
you've gotten it this far.
I'm working for you
and I paid you $50,000 to do it.
It should be
the other way around.
The thing is,
I mean, that --
I mean, we think that,
with your money,
we can take care of everything
except for the final step
of you just calling these
ice cream cone manufacturers
and just negotiating
the deal.
Look, I admire you guys.
14 years old with a patent.
That's very cool.
And I'm sure
that's a baking possibility.
Secondly,
it doesn't taste good.
That portion that you produced
has absolutely no taste.
-I took a bite --
-I loved mine.
No, take another bite.
There's no taste.
It was okay. It was okay.
Yeah.
So I think that
has to be brought up to speed.
That's okay.
You can fix that.
With a food engineer,
we could --
You could fix that, but I don't
think you're gonna fix it
by outsourcing it to somebody
else to solve your problem.
I agree.
The business is too young
for any kind of outsourcing.
You're the inventors.
You got to make it good.
Got to be your baby.
But I'll make you
an offer.
I'd like to be
a third partner for $50,000
with the contingency
that you fix the design
and the quality of that product.
Wow, guys.
You got an offer.
It's been a little over a year
since making our deal with Mark,
and we've done
over $6 million in sales.
You guys are crushing it.
Now we've got to get you
to $25 million or more.
You've got 700 stores.
We've got to get that
way higher.
I'm gonna reach out
to some of the other NBA teams
so that
we can help you scale.
We've got
a lot of work to do,
but I have
every bit of confidence
that we're gonna crush it.
Great stuff, Kurt.
Shawnna,
I really appreciate it.
Today's meeting with Mark
was invaluable.
We're seeking $750,000
for 40% of our company
to help produce
a new musical magic spectacle
titled "Miracles"
for the Las Vegas Strip.
I'm a magician
who has studied
under the great
Harry Blackstone Jr.
I'm also a magician
and a pianist,
who graduated from
the Juilliard School
and played under
Sir Georg Solti.
Now, what makes us so amazingly
different than anyone else
is the unique combination
of a magician and a pianist.
It is.
Taking a crapshoot.
I have to go out.
I'm out.
Herjavec: It's a bet.
I would feel more comfortable if
you had a following or a brand.
Now, regarding brand,
I want to address that.
Las Vegas
is a unique market
in that people
want to go to Vegas
and see a show
they cannot see anywhere else.
But they have 10 other
magic shows they can go see.
It's virtually impossible
to make money
the way you're trying to do it.
I'm out.
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
Thank you.
Guys, I look at risk/return --
too risky.
I'm out.
I'm looking
at the two of you,
and the only thing
I'm thinking is,
you should <i>not</i> be in Vegas.
[ Chuckles ]
I -- Seriously.
I think that you should be
in a great major city.
Just take the city of Chicago
or the city of New York.
Cuban: Right.
Tons of hotels and
tons of people that live there.
I don't think,
at least in Chicago,
that there's
any big illusion shows.
No.
You should be doing
exactly the opposite.
You should go
into the small towns....
If they move to Chicago...
...for $50 tickets.
...will you
give them the money, Lori?
I love what you're doing,
but I think you're focusing
on the wrong market.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
You guys are great.
Good luck.
All right. Thanks.
All right.
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm joined today by
world-champion runner Max King
and our friend Sophie.
My partners and I
are offering
a go-to-market investment
of $500,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company -- kidRunner.
KidRunner is the world's first
and only high-performance,
multi-terrain,
hands- and arms-free kid jogger.
You know, every year,
new parents spend $1 billion
on kids' strollers and joggers.
And instead of getting
the fitness, freedom,
and performance they loved
before having kids,
they end up with a heavy,
awkward, glorified shopping cart
that increases injury
and forces them to trade off
among the things they love.
KidRunner
changes all of that.
KidRunner is safe,
comfortable,
and has the potential
to reduce injury.
With kidRunner,
we've won competitive races,
and we finished half marathons
with our kids.
We want parents
to have something beautiful,
safe, and high-performance
to run and explore with.
And with your help,
we will lead the way.
-Will, can I try it?
-Absolutely, we'd love it.
Herjavec:
I'm a big runner.
I used to run
when my kids were little.
And I never saw one
like this.
I saw
the one that you push.
Mm-hmm.
And it's hard
to run with that.
It's super hard.
Up hills, everything.
Many of the comments
you guys are making
are the things that we've been
addressing and have solved.
How hard is it for Sophie
to get in and out of that?
So, let's show you.
She looks to me
like she's a little bit
stomach-sick right now.
I think
you'll be surprised.
We put
a tremendous amount of R&amp;D
into stabilizing the rig
as you get running.
Good job, Soph.
Max: Do you want to say bye
to everybody?
Bye, Sophie.
Will: There you go.
See you, Soph.
Thank you.
Herjavec: Will,
every time a child sees Kevin,
it's the reaction we get.
[ Laughter ]
Let's just look
at the market sales.
Let's assume this is
the very best device to run with
with a child behind you.
I'm gonna give you that,
okay?
Okay.
Now I'm asking myself
the marketing problem.
I have to find the customer
that's a subset of the parents,
because not everybody
wants to run with their child,
so it's a subset
of that market.
So, 4 million new kids born
in the United States every year.
This is just
the United States.
400,000 of those parents
call themselves runners
the day that kid is born.
I'll tell you
the flaw in that.
When I run
longer distances...
Mm-hmm.
...I'd want
to see my child.
I don't know if I'd want
to run a long distance
and assume that the kid is okay
behind me.
First of all,
the kid can't fall out
because
we've met or exceeded
all of the ASTM safety
standards -- five-point harness.
Besides which, a kid
would scream right away.
I'm sure of it.
You're never gonna not know
the kid is there,
and, Robert,
while you're running,
it's designed
so that you can just look back.
While you're running with a pram
or a stroller in front of you,
you can't see your child.
How do you get it
into the car?
So, the wheels -- quick-release
wheels off, the top --
Show me.
So, these we bolted in,
but they are designed
as quick-release wheels.
Why?
Why did you
have to bolt them in?
Because we wanted
to tune this rig
so that it
was completely on sync,
because this is
our go-to-market prototype.
And how much
were you looking for?
Why would somebody on
Kickstarter give you money?
We were asking
for, uh, $100,000.
How much did you raise?
$6,000 to $7,000,
but I'll tell you why.
Wow.
Ouch.
Oh.
Only $6,000 to $7,000?
We were deluged by people
saying, "I want a kid runner.
I don't want to sponsor one
of your ambassador athletes."
O'Leary: I'm still waiting
for you to tell me
how I sell
$5 million of it.
Where we are right now is we've
set up retail ambassadors.
We have an online B2C site.
We have
an e-commerce plug-in.
You love
this ambassador thing.
The ambassador program has been
really important for us,
partly to get ahead
of some of the questions
you guys have been asking.
But for us,
that was two years ago.
So, we've been asking
the questions you guys
have been asking for years.
Cuban: Will.
Yeah.
Why has it taken you years
to get to a 95% ready point?
Well, it's taken us
three years
because the technical design,
engineering solutions for this
are radically complex.
Corcoran:
Will, I want to say something.
Yeah.
This is what I'm really
disturbed about.
I think you're the type of
person who's a careful plotter.
So I don't believe that
you're the kind of entrepreneur
that is really going to get it
out there and done finally
with a lot of sales.
And so I would definitely
have to be out.
Okay.
And for those of you
who are potentially still in,
I want to disavow
everything you just heard,
although I appreciated
hearing it.
Please do.
Oh!
Yeah, so,
it is a child sports product.
You have to be safe.
Of course!
You have to be careful.
And you're gonna be saying that
forever.
But, no, we take -- we launch
our pre-order site in five days.
This was an R&amp;D project.
So three years to solve
for the first time...
Did you take the --
...safety
and high-performance.
Will, did you take deposits
from any of those?
So, we will ask
for a $200 deposit
once we launch
our pre-order campaign.
Right, exactly!
See, you --
She is exactly right.
It takes nothing for you to set
it up and say, "You know what?
If we don't get it,
we'll give you your money back."
You got to take orders.
Eventually, you got
to stop making it perfect.
I'm out.
Perfection is the enemy
of profitability.
Now, I get
you got to protect kids.
You can't have
any mistakes there.
But Barbara
is exactly right.
And I have a feeling you are
just such a perfectionist
at getting this right
that it would take
73 years
before you actually
shipped this thing.
I'm out.
I also agree with Barb.
But I'll set that aside.
My problem
with the product
is I feel it's very
unengaging for the child.
And then
the safety aspect.
And I'm not a runner,
so I could be all wet.
But that's just my feeling.
I'm out.
O'Leary:
My biggest problem with this
deal is getting the customer.
I've lived my whole career
in the educational market,
where we tried to capture kids
when they were born
and sell to them
till they were 7.
There has never been a company
that's solved for it, just ever.
It's always been
the highest cost --
the customer-acquisition fees.
I think that's gonna be
a big challenge for you.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
I really appreciate
your feedback.
Thank you very much.
Good luck, guys.
Pleasure.
Great experience
for start to finish.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Good luck.
Good luck.
And I'm here today
seeking $400,000
in exchange
for a 10% stake
in my thriving children's
products company, InchBug.
Kids love juice boxes,
and parents love
the convenience of them.
But then there's that accidental
juice-box squeeze.
[ Laughter ]
Kids can't help it --
They <i>have to</i> squeeze
those juice boxes and pouches.
So, in order to save
those cute outfits,
your furniture,
and even
the back seat of your car,
I have created a solution --
MyDrinky.
MyDrinky is a two-piece,
adjustable juice-box holder,
and it comes
in four colors.
It is a no-brainer,
no-stainer.
It doesn't stop it
from leaking.
Right.
It stops the squeeze.
There's no guarantee
on leaking.
But one thing
that's wonderful about this
is the fact
that it adjusts in height.
It accommodates all these
juice boxes and pouches.
because you're asking $4 million
value for the Drinky-poo.
That's a lot a dough.
Okay,
of the MyDrinky product,
I've actually sold $50,000 worth
of this particular product.
Wow.
Cuban: But wait.
There's got to be more.
Surprise me
with the other products.
There is.
There is more.
That's what I want you --
If you want to take a look.
What's this product?
That's -- That was
my initial invention.
10 years ago,
I invented that product.
How does it work?
And basically, what it is,
if you look at it closely,
it is a label for your
baby bottles and sippy cups.
Oh, so your product
is just this.
Yes.
So, how much of that
have you sold?
Over the past 10 years,
I've sold $15 million.
You're kidding.
I can't believe that.
Why were you even tell us
about the Drinky guy?
What about the past year?
Past year, $2 million.
And how did you --
And how did you do it?
Distribution, first of all,
was out of my home.
Okay, but then...
Out of my garage.
Did you do it online?
We're trying to figure out
how you were selling them.
Right.
So, we sold them
on a website.
I'm just curious
because Robert's name
is actually cut into this.
Oh, it is?
It's not written on.
That's correct.
That's right.
So, do you stamp this out
and then send them?
Yes, we personalize
all of that at our office.
So, it's personalized.
So, let me just kind of give you
some history
so you understand
kind of where I'm coming from.
My company is InchBug,
which I created in 2004.
So, I started this business
out of the garage of my home.
And I grew it the first year
from $150,000 worth of sales
to $850,000
the second year.
What does one cost?
They're actually sold
in a package of four.
And they're sold
for $12.95.
How much does it cost you
to make them?
How much --
$1.44.
O'Leary: $1.44?
Personalized, as well?
Personalized, as well.
Listen,
you're the real deal.
What are you selling, though,
Orbit Labels or MyDrinky?
What I'm offering to you
is I'm offering you
a portion of my business.
So, it's
everything together.
That's correct.
Is this tried-and-true?
Do you know if this is working?
Yes, it's
absolutely working.
Only to $50,000, though.
That's it. Well --
O'Leary: When you compare
the success of the Orbit Labels
versus MyDrinky,
MyDrinky's a dog.
The labels are where
the action is.
I don't think
this is ever gonna be
what the Orbit Labels are.
Let's hear her out.
Well, let me
explain to you
why those sales
are where they're at.
Our manufacturer is based here
in the U.S., had two plants.
One plant burned down.
But what ended up happening is
they start shifting their work,
appeasing
their larger clients.
Okay?
So, we have had a big issue
with just inventory.
So, Orbit Labels,
where does it flatline?
Okay, so right now,
we're at $2 million.
Per year.
Per year.
And that's actually
been for the past four years.
So, they've leveled out.
It's flat. It's flat.
So, right now it's been
just a small incline.
Now,
this particular product
is one that I think
would be wildly successful
in the retail market.
-Whoa.
-And this is --
Have you ever played in the
retail space with a product?
No, and that's why I need --
that's why I need a partner.
I swear to you,
you are lucky.
It looks so much better
from the outside.
And even if you
get into the stores,
you have to worry
about your inventory,
monitoring, them sending
inventory back to you.
It's a huge problem.
A whole different business.
You've built a franchise online,
and you have customers
that are very happy
to buy from you online.
Yeah.
Why mess with retail?
I hate Drinky-poo in retail.
That sucks.
Narrator:
All sharks are still in,
which keeps me interested
in working with you.
The beautiful thing about your
business that attracts me to it
and why I'd like
to work with you is --
Take Wicked Good Cupcakes, run
by two women, and we want to --
Oh, no.
Not Wicked again.
Will you shut up,
Barbara?
It's important
information here.
I'm so tired
of hearing about that.
and I'll continue
working hard.
There's no reason to quit
at this point.
She's killing it.
Why does she want to do
something different like that?
-She is so smart, so smart.
-I feel sorry for her.
