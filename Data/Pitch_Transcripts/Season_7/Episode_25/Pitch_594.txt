My name's Brenda Lee Feldman,
and I'm from Austin, Texas.
Brenda, what --
Is this milk?
Yes, it is.
It's real milk.
How do you get it in?
You're gonna use
these two fingers,
Brenda, I'm thinking
what's wonderful about it
is you must have sold
a ton of it
but they are skeptical
about Brenda's desire
to take her kids' drink holder,
MyDrinky, into retail.
You should just focus
on the label.
You've built a franchise online,
and you have customers
that are very happy
to buy from you online.
Yeah.
Why mess with retail?
I hate Drinky-poo in retail.
That sucks.
I mean, 'cause you
have to give half your margin.
Who wants that?
Okay, we've been in our business
for almost 10 years.
If you walk into
any daycare facility,
you'll most likely find
one of our labels there.
Got it.
So we want to capitalize
off of that.
Greiner:
You can give it a whirl,
but to take
a lot of inventory,
get stock into stores,
if it doesn't work
and maybe get it back,
that would be
a problem for you.
Well,
I know there's interest,
because I am negotiating
with a big-box store.
Herjavec: Yeah,
but, Brenda, don't forget,
people in retail
like new things,
but it may not
sell through.
You have $2 million worth
of basically recurring revenue.
You're living the dream,
and the grass is always greener.
Retail is hard.
I'm out.
Thank you very much.
Cuban: Look, Brenda, you're
taking on a whole new business,
but you're not really playing
into your core competency,
which is customizing.
And you're selling
$2 million worth, right?
You're killing it.
But instead, you're --
you're trying to go in this
whole new world of retail,
which doesn't play to
the thing that makes you
different and better
and has really
made you your money.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
That's -- That's disappointing.
Brenda, I think the beauty of
a juice box is it's one step --
pop the straw,
and end of story.
You managed to take a simple
process that every mom loves
and make it complicated.
I would never
spend the time
opening that up, putting the box
in, putting the cap on,
then putting the straw in.
It defeats
the whole purpose.
So you're here selling
really a waning business
with your eye
on the wrong ball,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Well, I-I do believe there is
future for this product.
Greiner:
What I think is...
It's like the saying,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If you've got a winner,
don't quit it, don't change it.
Just keep going with it
until it doesn't work anymore.
You're gonna make it,
and I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
O'Leary:
Okay, here's my thoughts.
Okay.
Usually, when a company
comes into Shark Tank,
it's either going to work
and you're gonna have
a huge growth trajectory
or it's gonna fail
and we're gonna lose our money.
I would give you
the $400,000.
We agree on a royalty.
Your margins are huge.
You could probably pay me
a dollar on every one you sell
until I get back
three times on my money,
and then it goes away.
There's no perpetuity here,
but I own 5% of your business,
Wicked again. That's an
offer from a pig, Brenda.
You should know that.
Well, how are you
gonna help me?
O'Leary: You'll meet
my social-media team.
They're amazing.
I will put you on
to everything we do
on television,
print, and online.
He's asking three times
on repayment. He's nuts.
Brenda, listen.
I don't need Barbara
to negotiate my deals,
'cause she actually isn't
very good with numbers.
He's a greedy man.
You know that.
It doesn't matter.
My deal is very fair to you,
frankly, because --
But I am negotiating
with a big-box store.
I'm just doing
the final paperwork.
Oh, you love
the retail siren.
Well, I just want
to let you know...
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm not going there.
...I probably have about
$1 million worth of growth
anticipated for next year
with this product.
Brenda, I'm gonna put -- I'm
gonna put a contingency on it.
They're ordering
$1 million worth?
I don't want to invest
in a business
that is going into retail.
You have no idea
what you're doing, trust me.
You're gonna
take capital...
Well --
...and you're gonna
tie it up in inventory,
and it's going to float
for 90 to 100 days
before you get it back,
and some of this product
may not sell.
If that's your burning desire
and you want to do that,
I don't want
to invest in you, okay?
Well, I-I feel
as I'm on the path to it,
because I'm --
I'm negotiating with someone.
I understand that,
but it doesn't mean you --
This is
a critical moment.
He is telling you
"I do not see that vision,
and if you do it,
I'm not going to give you
the investment."
You know, I feel confident
that I can --
I can grow this business.
What I want to do is grow
a wholesale arm of InchBug.
It's binary.
I told you what I want in --
in you and how I can help you.
Herjavec: All right, Brenda,
you have an offer.
What are you gonna do?
Okay, so, I thank you very much
for your offer.
But I just cannot see myself
giving up this opportunity
to really exponentially
grow my business.
Then I have to say it.
You're dead to me, Brenda.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Corcoran: Thank you.
