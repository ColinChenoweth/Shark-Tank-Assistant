My name is Amy Roiland,
and I live
in Los Angeles, California.
I'm the C.E.O. and founder
of FashionTap.
I'm currently seeking $100,000
for 10% of my company.
FashionTap is
a fashion, social-networking app
that puts bloggers, brands,
and other influencers
at your fingertips.
FashionTap allows
anyone to make money
off the clothing
that they're already wearing.
Let me show you how it works.
FashionTap users create content
on the app, tag it,
and then share it
with their followers.
You can tag anything from
your eye shadow to your shoes.
This is Erica.
Erica's a fashion blogger.
Erica's followers
already look to her
for fashion inspiration and how
to style the latest trends.
With FashionTap,
if her followers are drawn
to a tagged item, like this
gorgeous statement necklace,
they can just tap that tag,
and that tag will take them
directly to the online store
where that item is available
for purchase.
Now, Erica makes
a commission on each sale,
so she's incentivized
to tag what she's wearing.
And on FashionTap,
her followers never have to ask,
"Where did you get that," again.
Brands and retailers love us
because bloggers
and online influencers are
the newest
and best way
to market your brands.
FashionTap was born
out of my love of fashion
and my dream of connecting
the whole fashion world.
Let's make it happen.
Okay, so,
this is already happening
on multiple platforms --
Instagram, Facebook.
Why you?
What do we need you for?
Right.
So, I'm a fashion blogger.
There's a huge void
in fashion networking.
Instagram is not comparable,
really, to what I've created.
You can't directly
tag products on there.
If someone posts sunglasses,
they can tag the brand name,
but they can't tag
that exact thing
that you can buy.
And they're not incentivized,
and they don't get money.
Aren't you concerned
that Instagram could
just add links
to their tags?
Not really because Instagram is
an everybody network.
It's not a fashion network.
And when you hashtag "fashion,"
you see dogs, food.
It's getting more and
more cluttered in that sense.
No question.
You can also post
your Instagram photos
onto the app, and everything's
written there for you.
Just tag it.
How do you make money
doing this?
Okay, so, we have
three revenue streams.
The first one is e-commerce
that I'm currently building
into the app right now.
And so,
off the big-box retailers,
we take 10% of every sale.
But then, those retailers have
to put all that stuff
in your inventory
and make it tagable, right,
in order for them
to agree to your deal.
Right, so,
when we're building that out,
we would negotiate with them
and do direct.
What are the bloggers doing?
Well, those are hard deals
to do, right?
Corcoran: Have you tried to do
any of those deals
with a big-box store?
As a blogger,
I work with Free People,
Jeffrey Campbell --
like, pretty big brands.
I have a lot of followers,
so I do have
those direct connections.
So, once I build this database,
or the user base, up,
I think that it won't be
too hard.
You've got to have enough people
for them to be interested.
Exactly, so --
How many downloads
have you had?
What's your
monthly active users?
So, we have
6,000 downloads to date.
We just launched --
-Over what period of time?
-Six months.
-Six months, okay.
So we just launched
the soft launch six months ago.
And our monthly
active users is 1,500.
And it's been
really organic marketing
through just my channels
and me being a blogger.
So, I haven't done any
paid advertising or anything.
The second revenue stream
would be sponsorships.
So, we would
facilitate sponsorships
with big brands, right?
So, they would send me
the denim jackets plus money,
and then I would pay out
the top users, bloggers,
and models or influencers
on the app to wear those jackets
in several different ways
and style them.
And then, we'd put them
on the "popular" page
so you could see
all these girls --
you know, different sizes
of girls wearing these outfits
in different ways.
How much money would that
girl get who's modeling that
for you, for example?
-Okay, so that would be
the third one, which is
affiliate links built in.
So, if somebody clicks
and buys any of this stuff
that these girls are tagging,
they're gonna get anywhere
between 3% and 35% of that sale,
dependent on what the retailer
has done with the affiliate.
What's your revenue
with that model now?
Okay, so, since the six months,
we have $60,000.
Your first six months
in business,
and you have $60,000
in sales.
How much have you netted
from that?
And that means $6,000
would be?
So what we would get would be
the 1% to 15% of that $60,000.
-But what have you gotten?
-$6,000.
We haven't taken anything
because I'm giving it
all back to the users,
the bloggers, so they --
So you're giving them the
full affiliate fee right now.
-Yes.
-Amy, how are you eating?
Why aren't you starved
to death now?
I'm really excited about this.
I think this is --
I know,
but you can't eat excitement.
How are you living?
I'm living off my savings,
and I have a chairman.
He's fronted $90,000
to create the app.
How much of the company
does he own?
38%.
And I have 33%.
I'd say $90,000 to get this far
is actually really good.
Who owns the rest
of the company?
Yes, so, my C.O.O. has 5%,
and my C.T.O. has 23%.
And then 1%
to the developer.
Well, what do you need
the money for?
I want to use the $100,000
for strictly marketing.
-Yeah.
-That's it.
I won't be paying myself.
I just want
to use it for marketing
to really get
my user base higher.
What are you gonna do
if it doesn't work?
Because getting --
going from six months in,
and then all of a sudden
only spending $100,000
and hoping you're gonna start
becoming viral, right?
So if
that $100,000 doesn't work,
what happens then?
Then, I'll just keep going
and going and marketing this.
And I think that it's
an amazing idea and, like --
But you know how hard it is
to all of a sudden catch fire
after six months in.
But we pay our users
to use the app.
Like, that's really
incentivizing.
You need to tell me
something better
because 100k isn't
a lot.
If we scale
to 100,000 monthly active users
on the app, we will have
$7 million for the year
of gross sales -- total sales.
And that's just doing
a straight line, right?
Yes.
And so -- And then --
That's straight affiliate,
you're saying.
If we add in
the e-commerce, as well.
And your goal is to get
to a bigger affiliate fee
because you're gonna have
direct deals...
-Exactly.
-...with all these providers.
I didn't hear anything
in your business plan
about the army
of business-development folks
you're gonna need
to go do those deals.
Those are hard deals
to do.
They're already cut pretty thin
in their businesses,
and they're certainly
not gonna want to cut
a big, fat piece
of margin for you,
considering
your relative size.
It's gonna take
a lot of time.
But how will you do it?
How are you building that
into your business?
I just think
the biggest issue right now is
finding these brands.
There is no fashion
social network out there.
Well, I would
wholly disagree.
And I'm sorry.
I was an Instagram investor.
Yeah.
I've watched that network
grow up from the beginning.
Right.
It <i>is</i> the fashion
social network right now.
And so, I have friends
like Sophia Bush...
-Right.
-...famous TV star.
Right.
She gets paid directly
by the brands...
-Okay.
-...to model their stuff,
to integrate it, to mention it
in the mentions, right?
Okay.
She's making
so much money doing it
that she's not gonna bring that
traffic over here to your app.
But are her fans happy
with going to her page
and seeing her in a
dress and going, "Oh,
who makes that dress,"
and then they can't directly
tag it and buy it?
'Cause it's annoying.
Look, I disagree
with Chris.
I think a Sophia Bush,
Michelle Phan, whoever it is,
is going to go
where the people are.
But you haven't answered
the most important question --
How are you gonna compel them
to use you?
Just going
and getting P.R.,
just going and spending
marketing dollars...
Right.
...is not gonna do it.
But because you haven't answered
that question, I'm out.
Okay.
Um, So...
-For me,
I think you have
some challenges.
I don't think the highest-end,
most influential people
are gonna come here
because they can do better
just doing stuff direct.
I mean, you're going
after the Holy Grail.
Since the days
I worked at Google,
everyone has said,
"Wouldn't it be amazing
to touch a button
on your TV remote
and be able
to buy the sweater
that Jennifer Aniston is wearing
in 'Friends'?"
-Right.
-Everyone's been chasing this.
I've seen a lot of swings
and misses on it.
You're getting closer, but
I think you also underestimate
how much work it's going to take
to do the deals.
-Right.
-And for that reason, I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Amy, I see Godzilla.
I see you.
And I see you very flat
and a stain on the carpet.
[ Laughs ]
-Okay.
-I wish you the best,
but I see bad things
are gonna happen to you.
-Wow.
-I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Well, Amy, you know, I --
You come out here.
You're the real deal.
-Thank you.
-That's right.
You're hip.
I love fashion.
Thank you.
I would love
to work with you,
but I just believe that
the Instagrams of the world,
they're gonna create some form
that you can buy directly
just like this.
And I just think
it's a little too complicated.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
And then,
there was one.
Come on, Barb.
You're ready.
I should probably be listening
to the technology gurus here,
but I'm gonna ignore them.
Are you making an offer?
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
Barbara is Amy's last chance
for a deal
for her social-media fashion app
FashionTap.
Okay, Barbara.
You know, I'm thinking
of another entrepreneur
that I invested in
named Grace and Lace.
-Uh-huh.
-The woman who owned
the business made
lacy boot cuffs
for the top of her boots.
It seemed like a long shot.
But ironically,
after all the investments
I've done in the seven years
on "Shark Tank,"
they have been
the most profitable.
And there's
something about you
that reminds me
so much of Grace and Lace.
And so --
Wait, Barbara,
I hear Godzilla.
-Yeah.
-I hear him outside.
Mind your own business,
if you don't mind, "Mr. Baldy."
I'm gonna make you
an offer,
but I need more
for the $100,000.
I need 25%.
Okay.
So, Barbara's made you
a very generous,
blood-sucking offer.
I have total confidence
in you.
O'Leary: Take it.
My goodness, what a chance.
You have escaped a giant foot
that will crush you
and make you a small,
yellow, flat pancake.
And don't even pay attention
to this guy.
-[ Sighs ]
That's coming.
I'm gonna have
to politely decline.
-I just can't.
-Whoa.
Do you have a counter offer?
I really wanted to just go
with the $100,000 for 10%.
-Wow, no flexibility.
-That's non-negotiable.
-Mm.
-Non-negotiable?
-No, because I also have a team.
-No flexibility?
"Shark Tank" platform.
Tens of millions of users.
[ Laughs nervously ]
You're walking out
without a deal?
You're not gonna give her
a counter at all?
-Okay.
-Amy, it's unusual that
an entrepreneur comes in
and sets their price
and it's totally non-negotiable.
-Right.
It's kind of the equivalent
of slamming a door
in someone's face.
-You can always make a counter.
-Well, I mean, if you think of
other apps, pre--
-Revenue?
-You know, users, pre-making --
Their valuations are
$1.5 million to $5 million.
Yeah, and a lot of apps --
A lot of app creators are
working in Payless Shoes
right now 'cause
it didn't work out, so...
O'Leary: Amy, you understand
the difference.
You haven't proven
the monetization of
the business plan yet.
I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
O'Leary: Wow.
Cuban: Good luck, Amy.
Goodbye, yellow pancake.
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
Sacca: Good luck.
-I thought she'd counter.
-You just dodged a bullet.
Roiland:
I came to "Shark Tank" knowing
exactly what I wanted,
and, you know,
they didn't give me that.
But I am very, very excited
about my app and the future,
and I'm not gonna stop.
Narrator: In season 6,
Nayeem Hussain
and Ryan Fant made a deal
with Robert Herjavec
for their smart heating-
and-cooling vent Keen Home.
Let's see
what they're up to now.
Hussain: When we first pitched
the Sharks,
our product was eight months
away from completion,
and we had no sales.
Luckily, Robert saw
our vision and invested.
The smart vent is
a technology
that allows people
to zone their heating
and cooling systems
on a room-by-room level.
This not only makes people
more comfortable,
but it saves them
a lot of money.
Hey, looks like this Nest Pro
deal is moving forward.
Great, man.
Since making our deal,
we've done
over $1.6 million in sales.
Hey, guys.
-Hey, Robert. Welcome!
-Wow!
-Good to see you
-How you doing?
Herjavec: I'm in New York City
to meet with the Keen Home guys.
It's interesting --
When they came on the show,
The other foolish Sharks saw
them as a vent product.
This is not a vent company.
This is a tech company.
So, this is
a finished product that we have,
and I can show you
our app.
So cool.
I hear we have a new product.
I'm anxious to check it out.
FANT: So, Robert, this is
our new product.
This is
the Keen Home smart filter.
Herjavec: Wow. Very cool.
How does it work?
So, it enables you to purify air
on a room-by-room level.
So, it clicks in
to our existing faceplates.
Mind blown.
Purifying airflow is
phenomenal, right?
Because you have a huge
indoor-air-quality issue.
But what if you could
odor neutralization to that?
What if you could add
fragrance diffusion to that?
I love it.
You guys are on fire.
Let's keep it going.
Herjavec: The future is
unlimited for Keen Home.
I believed in them
when I saw them in the Tank.
Today, they've expanded
even beyond my vision,
and I'm very optimistic.
All: Keen Team!
[ Cheering ]
Narrator: Next up is a business
that wants to make sure
you never get caught
in the rain.
Hot bags of brown,
steamy, rotten mush screaming
to be thrown away.
What a waste.
Well, Sharks,
not anymore.
Say it again.
Thanks
to My Fruity Faces --
Say, "Well, Sharks,
not anymore."
What?
Say, "Well, Sharks,
not anymore."
[ Laughter ]
Well, Sharks,
not anymore.
Zing!
Thanks to My Fruity Faces,
the all-natural, edible stickers
that makes eating fresh fruits
and vegetables fun and exciting.
We've used magical ingredients
mixed with fruity science
to create an all-natural,
safe, edible sticker.
You just peel it,
stick it, and enjoy.
So, Sharks, help us take
a bite out of healthy --
First of all,
I'd like to thank the kids.
Thanks, kids.
Corcoran: They didn't want
to eat their fruit.
See you, guys.
Nice hat.
[Laughs] Aww, he's so cute.
Look at him.
So, now we'd like to show you
our edible stickers.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Hey, Daymond.
-Hi.
So, now, I put this
on a piece of fruit like this.
And then,
you eat it, yes.
Mmm.
Pretty good.
It's basically
tapioca starch.
Okay, you're selling
a lot of this, right,
'cause you put a $2 million
valuation on this company.
-Correct.
-So, how are sales?
So, we've had
$125,000 worth of sales
in the first three years.
-Whoa.
-Three years?!
-Three years.
-Three years?
-Yeah.
-What did you sell last month?
We sold about $2,000
last month.
Dollars?
Cuban: Ohh, guys.
Yes, and let me explain.
Let me explain.
Here's what's happening.
-You should explain.
Okay, we landed Walmart
about a year and a half ago.
We did our test in 2014.
It went extremely well.
And we're gonna be going
into 3,600 stores.
So far, I'm excited.
What happens next?
So now we just need capital
to basically move forward
for inventory.
But this is real time?
This is right now?
Yes.
Wait a minute.
You have orders --
purchase orders --
Or do you have --
Or you just became
an approved vendor,
and they're discussing
with you rolling you out,
testing you,
in all doors?
The contract basically says
we're a vendor
and that we can go
into 3,600 stores.
Ohh!
Did they give you
a purchase order?
No, no, no.
That's not the same.
They haven't given us
a purchase order, but let me --
[ Both groan loudly ]
I can get the purchase order
and get --
We're actually dealing with
the head of produce in Walmart.
And our discussion
basically was we were looking
for the price point
to go ahead and figure out
whether it's $1.99
or $1.49.
