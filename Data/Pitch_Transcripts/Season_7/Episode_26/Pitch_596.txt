Hi, Sharks.
Hi, Sharks.
I'm John O'Connor.
And I'm
Anusha Kambhampaty.
And we're here seeking
$400,000
in exchange for 20%
of our company 'Brellabox.
What do you do
when a rain storm hits?
You scramble
to find shelter
or maybe attempt to shield
yourself with your jacket.
Or worse yet,
you buy a low-quality umbrella
from a street vendor,
which quickly breaks
and ends up
in the trash.
Because we all know
what happens to a cheap umbrella
in a wind storm.
In fact, every year,
worldwide, we throw away
enough umbrellas
to build 25 Eiffel Towers.
What if you could simply rent
an umbrella?
'Brellabox makes
that possible.
Cuban: [ Laughs ]
-Oh, wow.
-No!
Kambhampaty: Imagine
'Brellabox located strategically
throughout the city
in places like restaurants,
hotels, your apartment building,
your office building,
even the subway system.
Here's how it works.
Using a credit
or a debit card,
for a small fee, you can rent
a high-quality umbrella.
You enter your e-mail address
or your phone number
so that 'Brellabox can
remind you
when your umbrella's due back,
and when the sun comes out,
you return it
to the nearest machine,
which could be found
using our app.
There's no more waste.
There's no more hassle
of having to lug around
an umbrella just in case.
So, Sharks, who wants to set
aside some money for a rainy day
and partner with us?
John: How much is it
to rent the umbrella?
It's $1.50
for 12 hours, right?
So, we've been contacted
by over 23 universities.
How? How did they
find out about you?
Kambhampaty: We had a lot
of press coverage.
There you go.
Okay.
A lot of people just gravitate
towards this idea.
Especially in New York
or other walking cities,
people know what it's like
to get caught in a rain storm.
They buy
a street-vendor umbrella.
It breaks.
The cycle continues.
There's a reason
why the street vendors show up
selling the cheap umbrellas
the minute it starts raining.
So give us the numbers.
We have 85% to us,
15% to the university.
And we bring in
a third-party sponsor
to put their sponsorship
on the machines.
So, you can put
the brand name of a sponsor
on the front
of the machine.
All of the umbrellas can be
branded for a sponsor.
It's very similar to Citibike,
which is in New York.
Messaging.
Are any in action
right now?
Do you have
these placed anywhere?
So, we've been
iterating on the machine.
We put one in WeWork.
-[ Groans ]
-What does that mean?
That means they're pre-revenue.
[ Chuckles ]
We put one in WeWork
in the financial district
in New York City.
We did a pilot test run
with one box.
It rain?
Was there demand?
So, there were 16 rainy days
in New York City
during the three months
that we did our pilot program.
On a rainy day,
25 people came through
and used --
-What was the price?
So, the price was free
at WeWork.
And if you didn't return
the umbrella,
what was the charge?
$40.
Have you invested any money
in this yet?
Yes.
Can we have a moment of silence
for that dead money?
[ Laughter ]
Mr. Wonderful,
as much as you love money,
you should listen
to an opportunity
to make some money with this.
-It's so important for me...
-I'm telling you.
-You're so lucky you met me
because I will stop
this madness now.
This is maybe the worst idea
I've ever heard on "Shark Tank."
-The marketplace dis--
-It could be.
It is hideous.
And I don't want you
to waste your lives.
-Wow.
-I'm out.
What do you do when you get
stuck in the rain?
Are you out of your mind? I pick
up an umbrella for $4.99...
Get him.
Get him, Anusha.
...and I throw it out
when it's over.
He melts.
That's what happens.
What does it cost you --
Eleven-fifty to make this
in a limited run
of 50 machines in Kansas.
-Eleven --
-$1,150.
-Okay.
We can get this
down to $975 for 200.
-Let's just say $1,000.
-Okay, let's say $1,000.
Is that
with the umbrellas or no?
We've never paid
for an umbrella.
The largest
umbrella manufacturer has been
giving us umbrellas
for free.
Okay, well, that's good.
Why would they be giving you
the umbrellas for free?
Because if you can put
your umbrella in 'Brellabox
and it withstands the rigor
of being a rental umbrella,
that is consistent
with the brand messaging
that a lot of these large
manufacturers want to have.
You don't think there's
a conversion process there?
It's raining outside.
Like, "Wow, I now have
to put my credit card in.
I'm tired."
I just don't --
I don't do it --
the process.
But remember, you're doing it
in the rain, as well.
And do it in the rain.
And, Daymond, don't forget you
have to return the umbrella.
O'Connor: These are
indoor machines.
You have to return it.
Cuban: See, I look at it
completely different.
Where am I gonna return
the umbrella to, as well?
Why can't you tell
the truth?
It's a horrendously
crappy idea.
Yeah, but if I return it --
Why are you yelling at me?
It's not my company.
Because I'm just worried
about you guys.
I'm worried about you.
[ Laughs ]
Why waste your lives
on such a crappy idea?
O'Connor: Look, look,
we're a real start-up.
We're used to the taste
of blood in our mouth.
You're not the first person
that's criticized this.
Oh, it sucks!
You're not the first person
that's criticized this idea.
The marketplace is
saying something --
Really? I wonder why!
You know what,
Mr. Wonderful doesn't worry
about his hair getting wet.
The rest of us understand
that problem a little bit.
It's horrendous.
Okay, Chris, step up.
Fund this thing.
I'll step up and tell you,
look, I live in California.
I'm sure we won't see rain again
for another five years.
Plus, these shirts are
so full of polyester
and rayon that
they're essentially
a waterproof raincoat
at this point.
And so I haven't suffered from
this problem in a long time.
So for these reasons,
I'm out.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Have you actually taken
an order from anyone?
Yes.
And what is it?
We have an order
from Michigan State University
at their law school --
for one unit.
For how many units?
We're finalizing
our contracts
with East Stroudsburg
University.
Four bo--
-How many?
Four box pilot.
Ultimately, 20 rollout.
Are your umbrellas better,
by the way?
Yes, these umbrellas are
phenomenal quality.
Mr. Wonderful, would you like
to see an umbrella?
-Let me see.
-Sure, show me the umbrella,
but it doesn't change
the outcome.
Corcoran: You want to know
what I think?
I think the umbrellas are
too nice because when I buy
those cheap umbrellas, I'm
throwing them in the garbage.
This is, like, a very heavy,
well-made umbrella.
Yeah, but that's the problem.
You're throwing it away.
And if you decide to keep it,
they make 40 bucks,
and it costs you nothing,
right?
Great. They got your credit
card. You can buy it.
But it's a lot of money
for a little bit of the company
with a lot of uncertainty.
I don't think it's a bad idea.
I think Kevin's wrong.
No, he's right.
It's <i>horrific.</i>
I think there's
opportunity, but --
-We believe deeply in it.
-Say it, Mark.
-We believe deeply.
-Bring it out, big boy.
I believe deeply
in this business.
I'm out.
Okay.
The problem with the idea is
for it to have
any legs to stand on,
you need a lot of boxes.
And for every box
you put on the street,
by the hotel,
in Wall Street, on a campus,
you got to shell out
1,000 bucks of your own money
before you get
any revenue sharing going.
And then, you're sharing
the upside with the university.
Well, that's
where the sponsor comes in.
If a sponsor comes in --
Yeah, but it's
not arranged yet,
and that's
another whole layer of work.
I just don't think
it makes any sense
no matter
how you look at it.
Yeah.
I'm sorry to say I'm out.
-Daymond, please.
-Am I the last one in?
Give them $400,000.
I just don't want
to be disrespectful
towards the fact
that they want to work hard
and create this,
but it's not an everyday item.
I mean, maybe you need
to find a box that puts
something in there
that people need every single
day on the streets of New York.
So I'm out.
All right, guys.
Thanks a lot.
Yep, all right.
-Thank you.
Good luck.
Is that the worst idea
you have ever seen in your life?
No.
It's evil!
It's evil!
It's so bad.
You're gonna have
a whole cult of people
posting wet pictures of you
on the Internet now.
[ Laughter ]
Narrator: Next up is
a product designed
to get kids to eat healthier.
Cute kids.
John: Are you
the sole investors?
No, we actually have 12 other --
10 other investors.
What percentage
of the company do you own,
each one of you?
18% and 17.5%.
Corcoran: Can I clear
the deck a little bit?
The way I see it is
you had $125,000 in sales
over three years.
I just can't imagine
investing my money
and thinking
I'd really get it back out.
so I'm sad
to say I'm out.
Okay, thank you.
And one of the things
that I wanted to add is
we're actually partnering up
with Dole.
So we've realized there's
a tremendous opportunity for us.
I kid you not.
-Yeah, but, guys, you made
the cardinal mistake
of thinking
that money was gonna get
you there quicker.
You didn't do
many sales.
You should have taken
the small amount
of stickers you had
and hit every single school
you could hit,
hit every street fair,
farmer's market,
sold 10,000, 20,000,
50,000, have
a proven concept.
And you just made the cardinal
mistake as an entrepreneur.
And now you're suffering
from it.
I'm out.
How much cash do you have
in the bank right now?
We have about $4,000.
$40,000 -- four-oh?
-$4,000.
-$4,000.
-$4,000.
-$4,000.
-Whoa.
-Guys, Daymond hit
the nail
on the head, right?
When your back is
against the wall, you sell.
Sales cures all.
How much do you have
in inventory right now?
$64,000.
$64,000 of product.
You know, if you sell them
for 2 bucks a pop,
that's $150,000 almost
in retail, right?
So that's just
a matter of your efforts.
Your effort is
the one thing standing
between you
with $4,000 in the bank
and $100,000-plus
in cash.
Guys, I don't think you should
invest more money in this.
I'm out.
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.
Sacca: Hey, look,
I admire your hustle.
I admire your drive.
I do absolutely believe
that my kids would eat
more of these things
if they had faces on them.
The problem is
you don't benefit
as a result
of my kids getting healthier.
You sleep better at night
and the world is a better place,
but it doesn't roll up to the
balance sheet of the company.
You're out of money.
You got $4,000 left.
You've got your backs
against the wall.
You're asking for $200,000,
and all that would be enough
to do is pay off your
existing debt on the business.
It doesn't
actually leave you
with a lot
of working capital here.
Too many things have
to go right.
And so far, they're not.
They're going wrong.
I'm out.
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Chris.
I've been fighting
all my life.
I know
that we can make it happen.
I see all the challenges,
and that's why we're here.
If I didn't believe in what
I was doing, I know that --
Belief is not enough.
Mark, what
are you gonna do?
I like the idea.
I like the concept
of licensed characters.
What do you have
in inventory.
-Nickelodeon.
-We have our Nickelodeon.
And you're allowed
to sell it?
Not anymore.
We're looking
to renew our license.
Something's not right.
It's not the idea.
It's not the concept.
It is the execution
100% of the way.
Something's wrong.
And because I have no clue
what that is
and I don't want to be
the one to fix it, I'm out.
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Sharks.
-Good luck, guys.
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck.
-Good luck, guys.
Thank you.
