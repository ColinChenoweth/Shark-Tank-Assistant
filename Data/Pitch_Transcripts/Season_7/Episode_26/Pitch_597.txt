Hi, Sharks.
I'm Bob Ntoya.
And I'm Adam Gerber.
And we're
from Altadena, California,
and our company is
My Fruity Faces.
We're seeking $200,000
in exchange
for 10% of our company.
My Fruity Faces has invented
the --
My Fruity Faces
has invented...
the stick, uh, uh...
-"The solution."
the solution
that families are having,
or parents are having
in trying to get their children
to eat healthier.
Gerber: Like most parents,
my wife and I spend
a lot of time
and energy planning
and preparing
healthy snacks
and healthy lunches
for our kids.
And what do we find
when they return home?
Gerber: We actually did
a test last year.
The sales went great.
Everything went well.
What was
the percentage of sales?
78% sell-through.
Are you working
with any other stores,
or is this the one big store
you've put all your eggs
in that particular basket?
No, we're actually talking
with Target.
We're talking
with SuperValu.
We were talking
to Whole Foods.
-But just early-stage talking?
-Early-stage talking.
And just to add to that,
Sharks, one of the things
that we realized is if we can do
the licensed products --
And we've been
with Nickelodeon.
We actually had
a Nickelodeon license.
We realized with the licensing,
the numbers just shot up.
And how much
have you guys invested in this?
Altogether, we've raised
about $482,000.
-No!
-Ohh! Ohh.
O'Leary: Now, you have
to have some losses here
because you've invested
almost $500,000.
Sales were $2,000
last month.
Do you have debt
on this company?
Yeah, we do --
$177,000.
-Ooh!
-Ohh!
So, you're in
for $660,000, basically.
-Yeah, $600,000.
-Yowza, kiddies.
Gerber:
We have a great product.
We have a great contract
for distribution.
We have great licensing.
We have a lot of things
in place.
And the fact
that they couldn't see that is
extremely frustrating.
