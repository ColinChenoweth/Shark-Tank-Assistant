My name's Dave Vasen.
I live in San Francisco,
California,
with my wife, Simona,
and my daughter, Serena.
Whee!
I'm a first-generation American.
My parents came to the U.S.
from South America
with almost nothing.
They taught me the importance
of a strong work ethic
and the value of an education.
How are we looking
to get this out today?
Vasen: After school, I started
working in education technology,
building software platforms
for big companies like Amazon
and Cisco.
But when my daughter, Serena,
was born, everything changed.
Hi!
Come, run!
Vasen: I would leave
for work every day,
and I just found it so hard
to not be a part of her day
and how she was learning
and growing.
I knew with my background
and passion for education,
I could actually do
something about it.
Everybody,
say, "Cheese!"
Vasen: I developed
a unique product
that's focused specifically
on early education.
It connects preschool
and day-care teachers
to parents
and their children
in a way that's
never been done before.
85% of brain development happens
in the first three years
of life,
and every study shows that
the investment that you make has
a massive impact
not only on the individual
but on the greater community.
These are our kids.
This is our future.
And this is something
that we have to invest in.
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Dave Vasen.
I'm the founder
and C.E.O. of brightwheel.
I'm here seeking
a $400,000 investment
for a 4% equity stake
in my company.
[ Groans ]
brightwheel is the mobile app
for preschools,
day cares, and families.
And we are completely
revolutionizing early education.
Now, I believe
all of us are parents here,
and I want to ask,
when you come home
after a long day and you ask
your kids, "What did you learn
in school today,"
does this sound familiar?
Vasen: All right,
this is the experience
for millions of parents
across America every single day
and especially for younger kids.
You've been apart
from your little human being
for 6, 8, 10 hours a day,
and that is all you get.
You know, you want to be
a part of their day.
You want to add to their
learning once you come home.
And you can't.
And it's gut-wrenching.
And on the other side, on
the school side, it's no better.
In addition
to actually educating our kids,
teachers are managing
a ton of paperwork.
Let's face it -- They're
actually managing parents.
And on top of that,
they're even running a business.
The system is broken,
and brightwheel is the solution.
So, let's jump in and take
a look at how brightwheel works.
So, with brightwheel,
teachers can easily check
kids in from the mobile app.
They can log activities
and assessments during the day.
They can send quick updates.
And they can even manage
their business all in one place.
And we're just seeing
an amazing amount of photos
every single day
on brightwheel.
And this is the reason.
You take it, you tag it,
and you are absolutely done.
And now we're gonna look
at the teacher app.
So, this is the teacher's room.
And we're gonna click on
"activities" at the bottom here.
And this is all being done
on paper today.
So, we've taken it
and combined it
and made it super-fast
and super-easy.
And so we're gonna click
on "nap" here,
and then we're gonna tag
three kids
that just went down
for a nap.
And the key about brightwheel is
we're saving teachers time.
You actually have
measurably more time
with kids
every single day.
Now we're gonna flip over real
quick to the parent experience.
So let's jump to the mobile app.
This is actually my little girl,
Serena, and this is her day.
And as you can see,
I get a sense of not only
what she's doing
but what she's learning.
And so, when I come home,
I can actually have
a conversation with her
about it.
My connection
with my little girl is
so much deeper
because of brightwheel.
And by the way, in the middle
of a pretty tough day,
it doesn't hurt
to get a photo like this.
[ Chuckles ]
Sharks, this is
a unique opportunity
to build a massive business
that has a massive impact
on people's everyday lives,
and that's something
that we hear every day.
So, I hope you'll join Serena
and our team
in bringing brightwheel
to every preschool,
every day care, and every family
across the globe.
Are you selling me
this platform, this dashboard?
Is that what's happening?
-Yes.
How much am I paying for it?
Right now,
you're paying nothing.
brightwheel's free today.
When we have
our premium product,
you will be paying
a monthly fee for that.
The parent will pay,
or I'll pay?
You will pay as
the administrator or the owner.
And will the parent
ever pay anything?
Not today.
We're building a platform.
We see a lot of opportunity
to add value to parents
down the road.
Except you can't advertise
on that platform.
Correct, and we have
no intention to advertise.
Wait, you can advertise
to the parents all you want.
We don't want to. We think
there's a ton of ways --
-But you can.
-You'll have a very hard
time with that model.
No way. No way.
No, and we have
no intention to.
So let me walk you through
what brightwheels look like.
So we started with a pilot
in the fall of 2014.
How many schools
did you get signed up?
Yes, so we got 10 schools
in the pilot.
Literally, no product.
And so we worked with them.
We listened to them.
We understood their needs.
In June of this year,
we launched publicly
as brightwheel.
We went from 10,
and then now
we have 2,500 schools.
We're in every state
across the country.
Wow.
So, how are you
gonna monetize this?
First, I just want to say
that when you look
at other industries,
all of these industries
have really great
dedicated software
that's provided
by very large companies.
This is a massive market
that doesn't have that,
and so that's where
we see ourselves fitting in.
Well, a lot of that
has to do with the fact
that they don't have money
because they're very much
small proprietors.
But they do have budget.
Well,
they're just mismanaged.
I've got a 4-year-old,
a 2-year-old, and a 2-week-old,
and I pull
my hair out sometimes
looking at how the preschools
are managed as a business.
And they -- Right.
I offered to write software
for my kid's preschool.
-Yeah?
-And that's why we love it
'cause we take all that
off their hands
so they have more time
with kids.
You're doing
so many things at once.
That makes it a little harder
to pitch this.
Yeah.
That may be where the
opportunity lies, too, right?
You're doing something
for schools,
something for parents,
something for teachers, as well.
Right.
We're in everything
from four-person
in-home day cares, even --
A lot of people are actually
using us with nannies,
so single person --
all the way up to an elite chain
of preschools.
So we're gonna offer
at the low price point
around $40 per month for
a really small in-home day care,
and that scales up
to $200 in terms of the --
So the top price is $200...
Right.
...and that could be
50 kids, right?
There are some
very large centers,
including ones that we're in.
We're in centers
with several hundred children.
So that's --
-That's still 200 bucks?
Yes. Yeah.
Wow.
Have you raised any money
from investors?
So based on the pilot,
we raised a seed round
of $2.2 million
at an $8.2 million valuation.
Besides money, what do you want
the Sharks to contribute
to this --
to your venture?
We're taking on
big challenges now.
We're looking to scale.
We're looking to build
a global brand.
I'm not just here for money.
I'm not just here for PR.
I'm here for
the partnership possibilities
of bringing on Sharks
onto our team
and the value that that adds.
We want to be the brand
of early education.
The problem is
the law of small numbers.
I mean, I actually understand
what you're doing,
and I've been
in your space.
Okay.
I made a lot of money in it,
actually.
And I think it's brilliant.
I think you've done something
really interesting here.
I don't know what your plans are
in the monetization.
So it's $1 million next year,
$6 million the year after that,
and $20 million after that.
I believe it.
Okay, look,
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you $400,000,
but I want 10%.
I just bring too much.
[ Chuckles ]
Kevin, I appreciate that offer.
I really do.
And the fact that you want
to be a part of this,
more than the number
of the equity --
Yeah, but 4% --
How can, like --
It's like...
I understand.
It's, like --
Oh, and look,
your background --
You sold an education company.
That -- That is valuable.
What is challenging for me is
our investors had my back
as a --
-I trust you on that.
-Right. Right.
-But how do I get motivated?
-But you knew that coming in.
I think you're gonna have
that same frustration.
And I mean, you knew
you'd have to negotiate, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, and -- But I want to find
something that works, but --
Well, Dave,
I don't know if I can add value.
Listen, you have Mark
and you have Chris
really savvy in that space.
You have Kevin,
who understands child education.
I don't think I can help you.
I'm out.
I appreciate your time.
I really do.
How many schools are you
gonna add this month?
So we're adding on average --
We added 38 yesterday.
We're averaging
about 40 to 50 a day.
So all right, look,
I really like this business.
I warn you not to promise,
like, we're never
gonna advertise, et cetera,
because I do think
you could add a lot of value
with offers, coupons.
People in this demographic
actually want good products
to be put
in front of them.
And so I think that could be
one fun channel.
Absolutely.
I want to make you an offer,
but I have a hard time
paying more than anybody else
paid for the business,
particularly considering
what I bring with my background,
the value I think I bring
to your platform.
Absolutely.
So I'd like to give you
the 400k you're seeking,
but at the $8.2 million
valuation of the last round.
We give you the 400k,
and we're off to the races.
Dave has two offers on the table
for his early-education
software platform brightwheel.
However, things have become
heated in the Tank
after Dave suggested Sharks
go in on an offer together.
You tell me.
What do you think you need from
the rest of the line here?
Are you serious?
Are you really that clueless?
No, I'm just -- I'm...
Seriously,
are you really that clueless?
I haven't heard you
speak up, Mark.
I'm listening, right?
Look,
I gave you a great offer.
Chris, I'm -- Chris.
Shark fight!
Shark fight!
And I'm confident
it'll hold up.
-Shark fight! Shark fight!
-So if somebody else wants
to speak up right now,
they should.
Chris, I'm --
I'm taking the offer.
I just want to know if --
if we're gonna team up
with anyone, or --
Wait,
you're taking the offer?
So you're not even
listening to anything else?
No, I'm saying
I want in with Chris.
Chris is gonna add
a ton of value.
I want to know if anyone else
wants to join the deal.
I -- I've got two
pending questions.
Yes.
What else do you need
from somebody else?
Right.
And is anybody here
nominating themselves
and bringing something
to the table?
And I haven't heard anything.
-Let me just say --
First of all, I don't need
to nominate myself.
-I'm listening.
-Right?
So I don't need
to convince Chris of anything.
I have no problem with Chris
and the value he brings
to the other companies
he has, right?
When he assigns
his name to it,
it holds
a lot of street cred
in his little part
of the world.
Once you get outside
of that little bubble
called Silicon Valley,
it doesn't mean [bleep]
-As far as I know --
-Ooh. Ooh!
If you want -- If you want
to create a brand value
so that somebody who's working
in Texas, Pittsburgh,
Maine, Florida,
and wants to have
an extra level of confidence
to say, "You know what,
this was validated
by somebody that we trust,
somebody that we know
has a track record,"
your job gets easier.
But that doesn't seem like
a problem
'cause you're in
50 states already.
But hang on.
Hang on.
While the two ends of the Tank
are squabbling like chickens,
I just want
to point something out.
-Yes.
-The only Shark that's ever had
a multi-billion-dollar exit
in your space
is Mr. Wonderful.
Right.
This is my space.
Right.
I know exactly
how to help you,
and I think, frankly, I bring
a lot to the table on that.
I'm not gonna fight
with Chris
about whether
he should be alone or not.
To get involved now,
I have to compete with his deal.
So I'm willing to match him
'cause I have no choice.
I like the deal.
I really do.
Right.
Cuban: The percentage
isn't the issue
because it's shuffling
deck chairs on the Titanic.
Either you're gonna make it
or you're not.
Right.
Right?
And so whether it's at 8.2%
or $10 million,
that's not the issue.
Okay.
Are you considering
making an offer?
Yeah, I like it.
So I mean,
he's done most of the work.
It's gonna be those
other schools on the margin
or being able
to get to groups
or being able
to create confidence
because the application
does the job.
It does.
And it works great.
Right, so what creates
the confidence...
Right.
...that makes someone
to say yes to a decision
when maybe they don't
understand it completely?
Maybe they're not
in the wheelhouse...
Right.
...of how you're getting
deals currently.
That's the biggest hurdle
we're trying to cross.
David, when you're
asking these guys in,
are you willing to give up
more equity for more money?
And that's what
I'm trying to figure out
so they can even know
how to position themselves.
I would consider it.
We came in here
with -- with a concrete ask
in terms of a -- of a budget.
If it means getting more Sharks
and -- and having more people
at the table,
then I would consider it.
I'll do it either way.
I think partnering with Chris
is smart,
and obviously,
you see the value there.
-Right.
-And I don't mind doing that.
He may not think there's value.
I'll leave that to him.
Or I'll leave it to you
and say I'll hit your number --
400k at the price
that you ask.
-At 4%.
-At the $10 million valuation.
Yeah, because
I have enough confidence
that I add enough value
that it will propel that.
Yeah.
So you're willing to do the deal
at $400,000 at 4%?
Either way, but I do.
Look, regardless of what
he said about me, right,
I see the value there
because I'm --
Silicon Valley's
its own little world.
Yeah. Yeah. Like Uber operates
in its own little world.
Right.
O'Leary: No, but wait a sec.
And Twitter operates
in its own little world.
And Instagram operates
in its own little world.
Ooh.
I've never been
outside of San Francisco.
I'm sorry.
Ooh.
-[ Laughs ]
-So, let me ask, then,
Chris, you know,
Mark just asked if you'd be open
to teaming up for a deal.
Is that something
you'd be open to?
What if we do --
So at the valuation
that Mark talked about --
$300,000 from Mark
and $300,000 from Chris?
We get it done, and we build
this thing together.
We're paying more than
the last guys paid, huh?
You're paying 25% more.
At that time, we didn't have --
-Whoa.
-No, don't do it to yourself.
We didn't have the products.
We didn't have the brand.
-Oh. Ohh.
-We didn't have
this team in place.
You didn't have
"Shark Tank," either.
Don't do it to yourself.
Congrats, Dave.
Thanks, guys.
I'm so excited
for what this means
for everybody using brightwheel.
These are the exact
right partners that
we wanted in place,
and we're just gonna --
We're gonna take this thing now
to the --
You know, this is a rocket ship.
You know what?
I just thought about this.
They didn't even think
about Kevin O'Leary.
[ Laughter ]
They didn't even
acknowledge him.
I thought it was way too little
for what I bring, anyway.
[ Laughs ]
That's -- That's great.
