Lieu: My family escaped
the Vietnam War.
I'm gonna create success
no matter what.
You bring a shareholder.
That's a whole different
ballgame.
No, not with
the right shareholder.
You sh-- I don't need
your opinion, Barbara.
Kevin, can you leave?
You're making the children cry.
Narrator:

First into the Tank
is a healthier version
of a favorite treat.
My name is Mai Lieu,
and I live in Hawaii.
I was born in Vietnam
to Chinese parents.
When I was four,
we escaped the Vietnam War.
[ Voice breaking ] It was
very tough growing up.
We were poor.
We didn't know
how to speak English.
My parents worked two jobs.
It was very challenging.
Seeing my parents
work very hard inspired me
to create something for myself
and create success.
My parents are my role models.
They support me,
and they inspire me,
and I wouldn't have the life
that I have today without them.
Now it's my turn
to take care of them.
Now, after 20 years
in the beauty industry,
I've developed
an amazing line of products
inspired by my struggles
growing up.
It has the potential
to help so many families
save time and money,
and I can't wait
to share it with the Sharks.
What I need most
is a strategic partner.
A deal with the Sharks would
make all of my dreams come true.
Aloha!
[ Laughs ]
Sharks,
my name is Mai Lieu.
I'm from Honolulu, Hawaii,
and my company -- CreaProducts.
And I'm seeking $200,000
for 10% of my company.
Growing up, we couldn't afford
to go to the salon,
so my mom would always
cut my hair at home.
And my bangs would end up
way too short and uneven.
I'm sure many kids and parents
can relate.
And, ladies, what about those
pinot grigio bangs?
You know, after you've had
a couple glasses of wine,
and you decide
to cut your own hair?
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec:
Does that happen?
No, I don't think.
-I do it all the time.
-Well, there's no more excuses.
Introducing the CreaClip.
It's a hair-cutting guide
that allows you
to cut your hair at home,
and get a perfect cut --
great for cutting kids' hair,
bangs, and layers.
First, I'm gonna show you
how I cut my bangs.
You just gather all your bangs,
slide, and you just trim.
So I'm just trimming off
all the split ends.
This is gonna create
perfect bangs.
Done. Beautiful bangs.
-Oh!
So I have a larger size,
a large curved CreaClip.
This is gonna create layers,
and it's really easy.
I want to show you next...
Can you
demonstrate on Lori?
[ Laughs ]
I don't want to mess up
her beautiful hair.
You just
flip your head over...
clip the CreaClip...
[ Clicks ]
...slide...
Now this is the best part --
it has a built-in level.
That's how you know
it's perfectly balanced.
And we're going to trim!
[ Laughs ]
-No!
-Yes!
I'm gonna cut
all this hair!
Wow.
I surf a lot,
so I got a lot of split ends.
So, this is gonna cut --
get rid of all the split ends
and create beautiful layers.
Are you seeing
the level?
Yeah. Yeah.
You can see. You hold it up,
and you just cut.
Sharks, are you ready?
We're ready.
Done!
Look at this --
beautiful...
-Wow!
-Wow.
...beautiful layers.
And it creates a beautiful
layer shape in the back.
Now, Sharks, who wants to cut
a deal with CreaProducts?
I have some samples for you.
So...
Oh!
There's CreaNails?
Yes.
So this one...
That's the CreaClip.
I have the CreaNails for nails.
What is this?
This is for makeup, and I'll
definitely show you that.
All of this
is the same investment?
Yes.
It's all included.
Mai, how -- how many CreaClips
have you sold
in the last year,
dollar-wise?
Uh, in the last year?
$550,000.
O'Leary:
Just the CreaClip?
-Just the CreaClips.
-You're kidding.
O'Leary: Is that your
number-one product?
That's my
number-one product.
What about the other products
all together?
Well, the other products,
they're new.
Mai Lieu, do you demonstrate
it online?
Do you actually show people
how to do it?
You know how --
how people find me?
They see my videos
on YouTube.
Really?
So that's the driver.
So, I do instructional videos
on YouTube.
How many followers
do you have on YouTube?
-30,000.
-30,000?
I have 20 million views,
and just last month,
my video went viral
and 500,000 people
shared it,
and I sold out of product.
I sold 150,000 that week.
I don't think you mentioned
what you sell one for.
So, my CreaClip --
online I sell this for $30.
My CreaNails --
$24.95 plus shipping.
And my CreaLash -- $24.95.
So, what is --
what is that CreaLash,
and how do you use it?
Y-Y-You do this,
and you apply the shadow
so it doesn't fall
on your skin.
Also, it works great
for mascara.
You -- it lifts the lid,
apply the makeup,
and it actually bends
the lashes, creating more curl,
and you get the -- You don't get
mascara on your skin.
What's your background,
Mai?
Oh, I've been in the beauty
industry for 20 years.
As a hair cutter,
a hair stylist?
Yes. A hair stylist.
When I was four, my family
escaped the Vietnam War.
It was a hard time.
We didn't have any money.
[ Voice breaking ]
Um, my mom worked at McDonalds,
my dad worked night shift.
So I said, "when I grow up,
I'm gonna create success
no matter what.
I'm gonna take care
of my parents."
And, so, you know, now that
I've created all these products,
I-I want to continue to do that.
Your dream was to make money,
take care of your parents.
Have you been able
to make money
out of the $550,000
in sales?
Yes.
Yes, uh, my profit margin
is 66%, and I make $155,000.
Good for you.
Mai, um, I can really empathize
with your story
about escaping communism.
Yes.
You -- We have
the same background.
Same background.
So, here's
one thing I know.
People always
say this to me --
"Why do you have such
a chip on your shoulder?"
And I always say,
"Because of where I came from,
I had no choice."
I had to be successful
to justify
my parents' sacrifice for me.
Anything I do
for the rest of my life
will never be as hard
as what my dad did for me
escaping from that country --
ever.
My father never took
one day off.
He worked seven days a week,
from morning to night.
You are gonna succeed.
There is no doubt
in my mind.
Somebody with that heavy
a burden
and pressure
to be successful...
Robert.
...is gonna make it.
I want to be in business
with you.
I-I don't think
I'm the right partner
to help you sell nails.
I'm out.
Cuban: I'm gonna make things
a little simpler.
As much as I think
I could help you,
I'm probably not the best
partner for you.
Aww.
Good luck with these guys,
but I'm out.
Okay.
Clearly, for me,
hair products are not my focus.
Why?
[ Laughs ]
I'm out.
Okay.
O'Leary: Okay,
there's two Sharks left.
They both
happen to be women.
They don't cut their own hair,
but they have some.
[ Laughter ]
So, what do you girls
want to do?
In my -- I don't know
if Lori's interested
in this product, um...
Lori, QVC!
Well,
are you interested, Lori?
I think there's something
important
to people being able
to just --
not have to spend
a fortune
and be able to cut
their own bangs,
or do a straight blunt cut
across the back.
So, yes, Barb,
I-I would be interested
in partnering with Barb
on this one.
Okay, then,
guess what --
I'm gonna do it
a little differently.
I'm gonna give you
a full-price offer
for exactly what you want
from Lori.
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Wow, Lori!
That's so generous!
Thank you!
That was Barb's offer.
You know, there's no better
motivation for an entrepreneur
than trying to prove something,
and that's what you've got.
But I have to say,
I think this product doesn't
have room for an investor.
I can't envision how I can make
money on this thing.
And not that
I don't like you,
but I'd like to make money
if I'm gonna put $200,000 in.
But as much as I love you,
I am out.
I know
that you are a go-getter.
I know
that you are driven.
I am gonna offer you
the $200,000,
but I'm gonna offer at...
25%.
But this year, I'm gonna
be making $800,000 in sales,
this year alone.
I know, but I feel like
there's some engineering work
that needs to be done
on some things.
I feel that for the time
and the efforts
and what we're going
to need to do,
that would be the right
equity stake for me.
20%.
No.
I'm gonna stick at 25%.
25%.
[ Inhales sharply ]
Tough call.
I'll meet you halfway.
22.5%.
Lori, I came here
and I wanted you.
So it's a dream come true.
Thank you.
I'm gonna accept the offer.
All right. Good.
Yay!
Thank you so much!
Aww,
you're welcome.
Thank you,
thank you, yay!
Your hair looks good.
Oh, thank you.
It does, doesn't it?
Mm-hmm.
There's no mirror!
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God! Yay!
My parents supported me from
the beginning, and they're --
they're gonna be so proud
once I go back
and tell them the great news.
I liked her
as an entrepreneur.
I thought she really
had the guts.
-Oh, she's terrific.
-She was great.
-She was great.
-She's the real deal.
-She was good.
Narrator:
Next into the the Tank
are siblings
with a home-grown idea.
Our main goal is to get
into the souvenir industry.
We want character and sports
licensing.
That's why we're here,
because we want to grow
our men's and kids' collection,
and we can see this definitely
in the souvenir industry.
That's pretty astute,
you know, for your age.
You not only have started a
business, been very successful,
but now you actually
even know a path
that you think's going
to propel you farther.
Corcoran:
I want to tell you a story.
I invested with Mark
in a business
called Villy's Custom Bikes.
Oh, don't go there.
"Don't go there," he said.
[ Chuckles ]
Beautiful bike,
beautiful entrepreneur,
but he had
a similar situation to you.
He had, probably,
300 different bells
you could customize
for your bike --
300 different tire wheels,
300 different seat colors,
and on and on it went.
And this is, I think,
a problem you're going to have
with your business here.
My word of advice would be --
you really have to figure out
what's selling
and concentrate on that.
Even though
it's not as much fun
to make a viable business
out of this, for me,
it's just not a business
I see making a lot of money,
and so I'm out. I'm sorry.
