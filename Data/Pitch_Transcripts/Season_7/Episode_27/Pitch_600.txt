Hello.
My name is Heather Saffer.
I'm from Rochester, New York.
I'm seeking $75,000
for 20% equity
in my company,
Dollop Gourmet,
the first healthier
and tastier answer
to one of the scariest
processed foods
on the planet -- frosting.
Who doesn't love frosting?
It's so sinfully decadent.
But the problem with
store-bought shelves'
table frostings
is that they're horrible
for you,
laden with chemicals,
artificial food dyes,
some even contain animal lard.
Who wants to put that
on their cake?
Dollop Gourmet frosting
is better for you
and tastes incredible.
Dollop is non-GMO, gluten free,
vegan, and 100% all natural.
It even contains
half as much sugar.
Sharks, I need your help.
Who's ready
for a little sugar?
[ Chuckles ]
-Yeah?
-Bring it.
-I have some samples for you.
-I'm a frosting freak.
You get the redless
velvet cupcake.
Ooh. Thank you.
Thank you.
Very nice presentation.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Saffer: And then, Mark,
you got vanilla.
Cuban: That works.
-Hi, Lori.
-Hi, Robert!
How are things
on the "Shark Tank"?
Saffer: So, the cupcake
is our vanilla frosting.
We use pure
Madagascar bourbon vanilla,
the highest-quality vanilla.
And then, next to that,
you have the peanut butter
cookie dough frosting.
There's the sea salted
caramel frosting.
And then, lastly, you have
the hot chocolate frosting.
Stuff tastes great.
What's in it?
Thank you.
Mmm.
We use organic
sustainable palm oil.
We use organic cane sugar,
and half as much.
What's
the shelf life?
It's a year, unopened.
How are you
selling it now?
We're selling it
in retail stores.
So, I launched the company
less than a year ago
in all 85
Wegmans locations.
A couple months ago --
-That is a great store.
-It is.
We got into all 215 Meijers
stores in the midwest.
Next month, we'll be launching
in two Whole Foods regions...
Wow.
...and in 152 HEB stores.
How did you get into
the frosting business?
So, in 2009, I was working
at a car dealership.
It was probably
my 30th job.
I hadn't finished college.
I decided that
I wanted to start a business,
and I saw that cupcakes
were becoming popular back then.
No kidding.
Who's got the number-one
cupcake?
Right here!
-I know! I know!
And so I decided I would attend
the school of Google and YouTube
and teach myself how to bake,
so I'm a self-taught baker.
I opened a bakery in Rochester
and aligned myself
with the wrong people,
and I lost everything.
Oh.
Um, I had to pay off my debts
and dissolve the company.
It was by a different name.
How much money did you lose
in that first bakery venture?
Probably about $20,000.
-Wow.
-That was my life savings.
Within three weeks,
I said I wasn't gonna stop.
I started a new bakery.
Everyone said I couldn't do it.
Corcoran:
Where did you get the cash?
I borrowed $4,000
from my parents.
That bakery became
really successful.
I won Food Network's
"Cupcake Wars."
I was gonna say
I recognize you.
-Do you really?
-Yes.
What are sales now?
We've done $170,000
since November.
This year, what do you think
you'll do?
About another $50,000.
$200,000 for the year,
you think?
Yeah. Approximately,
a little bit more.
What are your margins
on this product?
The margin's 40%.
I make it in Wisconsin.
I have a co-packer.
I make it for $2.30.
That sounds
a little high.
Which is the most expensive
ingredient in here?
The palm oil's
really expensive.
The jars are also expensive.
What is Wegmans
selling each jar for?
Wegmans sells each jar
for $6.99.
And how does that
compare with
the leading category killer,
and you know which one I mean.
Yes, I do.
What do they
sell theirs for?
They sell about $1.50.
-That's -- wow.
-Really?
-Huge issue.
Saffer: It's a --
It's a lot higher.
Corcoran: Wow.
We're also selling
on Amazon for $12.99.
What?!
Cuban: It sells for $6.99
in the stores,
and $12.99 on Amazon?
Yes, but we haven't
had any complaints.
Herjavec:
Is that a problem?
Nope. We haven't had
any complaints about price.
People are paying for it.
The formula that won
in "Cupcake Wars,"
is it the same formula
that we have here?
It is not.
I actually wrote a cookbook --
"The Dollop Book of Frosting".
Herjavec: And you wrote
a cookbook in your spare time!
I wrote a cookbook,
yep.
I researched
how to write a cookbook
and actually found
an agent,
got a book deal
with a publisher.
Do you have a pilot's license
and a PhD?
I don't!
So, which was the frosting
that won?
So, the frosting's are
in the cookbook that won, so --
Greiner: Okay.
Is it the same formula
that's in these,
or did you change it?
Saffer: Nope. I changed it
'cause they were butter-based,
and I really wanted
to create something
that everyone could enjoy.
So I wanted it to be
gluten-free, vegan,
dairy-free, soy-free.
It's something
that everyone can eat
because it's allergen friendly,
and that's a huge craze
right now.
Herjavec: Heather, let me --
let me tell you where I'm at.
First of all,
very impressive.
You are the definition
of "don't know when to quit."
Thank you.
It's not how many times
you fall down,
it's how many times
you get up.
I don't like frosting.
Cuban: [ Chuckles ]
Like, I --
I just -- I just don't.
Really?
Yeah.
Not so crazy
about the product.
You got to be passionate
about the product, so...
Saffer: Yes.
...love you.
I'm out.
I appreciate it.
You've got four other people
that obviously like frosting.
O'Leary:
Let me get the ball rolling --
I have a huge database
of people that buy cupcakes.
I am the number-one cupcake
FedEx'd in America toady.
Uh-huh.
So I would like
to go to that database,
cut a deal with Wicked,
and make this part of our
product line with your brand.
Okay.
How is your partner
gonna feel about that,
that you're bringing
in a competitor?
I think if -- if --
No, this is icing.
But your cupcakes
have icing.
We don't sell icing.
We don't sell icing.
But -- But they all
have icing on them.
This is to sell
to the supplemental market
who actually bakes,
'cause one of the product lines
you don't know yet
about Wicked
is we're gonna provide
the actual baked goods
so you can
bake yourself.
I can really help you
move it online.
Have the infrastructure
already, have the customers.
Have to work a deal
with my partners at Wicked,
but I think they're
gonna warm up to this idea.
Okay.
I'll give you $75,000
for 33.3%,
'cause I'm gonna have
to give them some
equity to make it work.
No, you're not.
I am.
Corcoran: Kevin, you're
asking her to welcome a partner
she knows nothing about.
Barbara, you can make
all the noise you want.
I want you to understand
the offer,
'cause I don't really care
what she thinks about it.
All right?
Saffer: I got it.
I will give you $75,000
for 33.3%.
Okay. Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
I really appreciate
that offer.
I think it's awesome.
And?
Narrator: One Shark is out,
but Heather
has one offer on the table
for her healthy frosting
company, Dollop Gourmet.
I will give you $75,000
for 33.3%.
Okay. Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
I really appreciate
that offer.
I think it's awesome.
And?
Herjavec: Barbara?
Yeah, I'd like to make an offer
for Lori and I.
Wow.
I'd like to get 30%,
so there's enough skin
in the game for Lori and I.
You're very greedy,
Barbara.
No, it's not
greedy at all,
because I would develop
your business
in the same way
I developed Daisy Cakes,
and she went
from $25,000,
or $28,000
I think was the number,
and she's at close
to $4 million, okay?
So I've walked your road
before,
and I'd like Lori
to sell this on QVC.
Greiner:
Barbara, I appreciate your
extending an offer to me.
My problem with it
is I don't think
that this is
a QVC-type item.
-I'm going out...
-Okay. Thank you.
...but I think you have
a great offer on the table.
Barbara, Lori
won't dance with you.
Will you go on your own?
Let me mull on it.
Heather,
I also follow my gut.
Uh-huh.
And in my particular case,
my gut's gonna be
out to the door.
I love icing,
but I can't, I can't, I can't
because I'd be ginormous.
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry, but I'm out.
All right.
Thank you, Mark.
Barbara?
-All right, Barbara.
You have an offer on the table
from Kevin already.
I would certainly give you
the same offer without Lori.
So, $75,000 for 30%,
Barbara?
Yes.
O'Leary:
I will say one thing.
Our unit volume is about
100 times that of Daisy Cake.
Your volume is not
100 times of Daisy Cakes.
The prob-- And the reason I --
At least, maybe more,
because we sell units
at $7.95.
-Dream on.
-Her cakes are $10,000 each.
She doesn't sell a lot.
[ Laughter ]
They're good, and she only has
to sell one!
The bottom --
I heard they're really good.
The reason
I want the extra equity
is I'm going to incentivize
my partners
to be partners with me
in this deal.
Well, Heather, their equity
is basically the same.
One's at 33%,
one's at 30%.
What does your gut say?
Who would you rather
be in business with,
Kevin or Barbara?
Heather,
we are both New Yorkers.
It makes a difference
to have face time
with who you're
in partnership with,
and I'm the best marketer
you'll ever lay eyes on.
I'll sell more of this stuff,
that's what'll happen.
-Believe me, his partners --
-You don't have with Daisy --
You can counter.
You can counter, Heather.
His partners are not gonna
put out a welcome mat
for you,
trust me on this.
O'Leary: What will happen is --
Heather,
what does your gut say?
Barbara, would you do 25%?
Yes, I would do 25%.
Okay. You have a deal.
You got it.
-Yeah!
-[ Chuckles ]
I'm pissed.
I, like, wanted you.
Thank you.
I love you. I wanted you.
More importantly,
screw you, Mr. Wonderful.
-Heather, great job.
-Thank you.
-Congratulations, Heather.
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.
-I hope you buy some.
-Oh, trust me.
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you, guys.
Before today,
Dollop was a one-woman show,
and now it's a two-woman show,
and that feels incredible.
I really wanted Barbara,
and I feel like
there's so many
possibilities now,
and I feel like
we're just gonna kill it.
Narrator: In season six,
Dan Barnes and Wesley LaPorte
struck a deal with Lori Greiner
for their cellphone sanitizer,
PhoneSoap.
I want to take this unit,
put it on QVC,
and sell hundreds of thousands
of dollars in it, like that.
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.
You touch your cellphone
all day long,
and when do you ever
clean your cellphone?
Yeah.
You just put this
into your phone to charge it.
It's UV light
and, in five minutes,
you've just
sanitized your phone.
LaPorte:
Lori said on "Shark Tank"
that she wanted to sell
hundreds of thousands
of dollars on QVC.
Actually,
we've sold millions.
Barnes: In the five months
before "Shark Tank,"
we did $537,000 in sales.
It's been just over a year,
and we've done $4.9 million.
Thanks for calling PhoneSoap.
This last year, we were just
trying to keep up with demand.
Now we're bursting
at the seams.
We've grown to 12 employees
and are busy just trying
to ship all the items
coming in.
We're actively looking
for new warehouse space
to keep up with demand
and expand our footprint.
When we first started,
we made a product
for consumer cellphones,
but as the market has evolved,
so have we.
We've introduced
PhoneSoap 2.0,
a universal version
for even larger phones.
And also PhoneSoap XL,
a version for tablets.
We know there's
a lot of opportunity
in healthcare and other
commercial applications,
and that's
our next big move.
Hey, Brooke, can I have a kiss?
[ Mwah ]
Growing up,
Wes and I always dreamt
of building
a business together,
and "Shark Tank" has literally
helped us fulfill our dreams.
It's changed our business
and our lives forever,
and we're so happy
to be able
to make the world
a healthier place.
All: PhoneSoap!
[ Cheering ]
Aloha.
