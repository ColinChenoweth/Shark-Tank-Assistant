Hi, my name's Shelby Gogulski,
and I'm 15 years old.
And I'm Gordy Gogulski,
I'm 10, and I'm her minion!
We're from Jacksonville,
Florida,
and our company
is Yourself Expression.
We're seeking $50,000
in exchange for
20% of our company.
Yourself Expression
is an interchangeable
accessories company
that allows
just one piece of jewelry
to be over 1,000
different designs!
After wanting
a pair of expensive boots
just 'cause of the cute bow
on the back,
my mom told me, "No way."
So I decided to create my own
bows to match what I wore.
This crafty project
got us searching
for anything we can create,
wear, and change.
? Create, wear,
and change ?
? Create, wear,
and change ?
[ Laughter ]
Yourself Expression
has five unique
interchangeable collections
that are designed
for women, men, kids,
and even the family pet.
We are considered a fun,
affordable addiction,
and our customers can't stop
adding to their collections.
From holidays to hobbies,
one perfect base...
can be endless designs.
We are asking for you all
to be a part
of our growing company
as we move into the souvenir,
character,
and sports-team industry
while growing our current
products for everyday wear.
Both: So, who's ready
to snap to it, and let's do it!
Thank you so much.
Gordy will now pass out
your gifts.
Cool. Good job, guys.
All the jewelry you're wearing
is yours, right?
-Yes.
-Nice.
All of it? The belt?
Yes, the belt, the flip flops,
the hair tie.
-Thank you, Gordy.
-Earrings, necklace...
-Yes.
So, Shelby, each piece
comes with a unique,
circular
little round thing?
Yes, uh, each piece comes
with just the snap base...
Okay.
...and then the Poppers
come separate.
So, I-I buy it...
You buy it blank, and then you
pop your design in.
...I buy it like this...
Yeah, you buy your blank,
and then you pop the design in.
...and then I buy
these designs?
Shelby: Yes.
We sell them individually.
We have a website.
We have a shop. We have --
Who designs them,
Shelby?
Um, I design them and we have
four manufacturers
that also help us design.
And do you have any retail
d-distribution?
Can I buy it in
a store anywhere?
Um, yes, we are in 90 retail
locations right now.
We're in a few boutiques,
hospitals, gift shops,
and in a few Hallmarks.
So what are your sales
gonna be this year?
$365,000.
So, hang on a sec.
You're 15 and you're 10,
and you're selling a grand a day
in your business?
-Yes.
-Sometimes more.
So, who owns the company?
Um, my entire family
owns a portion.
I own 35%.
Gordy owns 20%.
-Gordy, come on!
-My mom owns 25%.
What happened to you,
Gordy?
Your sister screwed you?
-[ Laughs ]
Can you tell us
how you started it and when?
I actually started it --
I actually started it, um,
a little over a year ago.
I was trying
to find a way
to help my parents
pay for my high-school tuition,
and I was making this -- these
interchangeable boot clips.
And I was just thinking,
"This isn't gonna
be a company,
I'm just gonna sell
to friends and family."
But then, I brought Gordy in,
we started designing,
and then in August
of last year,
we had our website created,
and from then till now,
we've done $250,000
in sales.
-What's your cost...
-Yes.
...and how much money
do you make on it?
Our Poppers cost us
between 30 cents and $1.
We resell them for $4.
And our bases cost us
between a $1.20 and $4,
and we resell those
between $10 and $14.
Wow.
You're making great margins.
Gordy, you're the finance guy,
right?
'Cause you answered
the finance question.
All right, so, your sales
are at $300,000
last year or this year?
$250,000 this year.
We're gonna do $365,000
in this year.
I love how you go
into the deep finance voice
when you say that.
-[ Chuckles ]
How much profit will you make
at the end of the day?
Out of $250,000 we've --
net sales have been $80,000.
All right.
So you're doing great.
Why do you need a Shark?
What's a Shark
gonna do for you?
Well, we need your, like,
business expertise,
and your connections
to theme parks, cruise lines,
boutiques,
and souvenir shops.
So, Shelby, this business
is defined by inventory.
This is a nightmare
in inventory management.
The bigger you get, the more
the challenge is gonna be.
It's amazing
what you've done,
but when I put money to work,
I'm deadly serious about it.
I'm out.
Gordy, I have to commend you
on the tie, first of all.
Corcoran: [ Laughs ]
You look fantastic,
well dressed a 10.
With your own blood, sweat,
and tears,
you created a business
that you're gonna, on track,
make a $100,000 a year.
It's -- It -- I mean,
it's just unbelievable
at your age, Shelby's age.
Are you okay, Shelby?
[ Voice breaking ]
I don't know why I'm crying.
Oh, don't cry.
Oh.
You've worked so hard.
[ Sniffles ]
You're doing so amazing.
You're doing great.
You okay?
Want some water?
I don't know why
I'm crying.
Kevin, can you leave?
You're making the children cry.
-Yeah!
-[ Laughs ]
I don't know why I'm crying.
I'm just crying.
You know,
the funny thing about retail,
one of the things they measure,
is sales per square foot.
So if you can sell
a lot of stuff
with the smallest amount
of footprint,
that's what big retailers
get really excited about.
This, combined with this,
could be a good business,
like, a really good business
that you could take wide.
-[ Normal voice ] Yeah, Exactly.
-Right?
Look, I love you guys.
You -- You --
You make me feel bad
that I haven't done enough
with my life, because you're --
you're so far ahead.
[ Laughter ]
But i-it's not for me.
Great job,
but I'm not your Shark.
I'm out.
This is a great company,
but this isn't the best
that you're
gonna be able to do.
You'll reach a point where
you say, "You know what?
This was
a great starter kit."
Well, I think
this is gonna be my future,
because I want
to be the next Pandora, okay?
I mean, you go to Disney,
you've seen Pandora,
and everybody's
surrounded by it,
'cause there's
all these Disney charms.
And I want to go into Disney
and see Yourself Expression
and all the Poppers
with the characters,
and see people swarming.
I mean, people are addicted
this -- to this stuff.
They love it!
Look, I like it.
I-I think the product's great.
But I truly believe
you'll find bigger
and better things to do.
And Gordy will take over,
he'll find bigger and better
things to do.
I just don't want you to have
the pressure of saying --
okay, now that you've taken
money --
because I-I think
people fail to realize
your obligations change,
you know?
It's not just about
growing the business,
it's also about
supporting the investor,
dealing with the investors.
I'm out.
You know,
I was listening to you,
and you remind me of a saying
I have that I love,
which is, "It isn't
'Who's going to let me?'
It's 'Who's
going to stop me?'"
You have
that drive in you.
Right now,
you're so successful that,
actually, as a Shark,
I might complicate things
for you.
I wish you the best of luck.
I'm out.
Thank you. [ Sniffles ]
Gordy, before you go,
ask your sister for more equity.
[ Laughter ]
Congratulations, guys.
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.
It's beautiful jewelry.
Shelby:
I was disappointed 'cause
they didn't really get it,
the sports
and the characters
and the -- the big process
we could have for this,
but I realize I got a lot
of great advice from them
in that -- you're gonna see me
in a few years, I guess.
Narrator:
Next into the Tank
is a toy that combines
the fun of skating and surfing.
