Hi.
I'm Randy Putland.
My name's
Bernie Miller.
I'm Reuben Guymer.
We're all from San Diego,
and we are the Spooner guys.
We're seeking $400,000
for 16% of our company.
Sharks, meet the Spooner.
It is the ultimate
board trainer
for simulating surf,
skate, and snowboard moves
on any surface.
You can ride it,
slide it, flip it, spin it.
Kids love them.
They just jump on it
and immediately start developing
their balance and coordination
while making up their own tricks
and having fun at it.
Speaking of tricks, we have
a real treat for you Sharks.
We do.
He's nationally
and internationally known
as the hardest-working man
on the Spooner,
Master Spooner, Mr. Spooner,
the Star of the Spooner,
Reuben Guymer!
Get him, Reub!
Nice, nice!
There it is!
[ Laughs ]
Nice!
Watch out! Watch out!
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my -- oh, my God!
Hold on, hold on,
hold on!
[ Laughter ]
Get him some water.
We'll be all right.
What?
Wait a minute.
I'm not done, man!
I got to ride the Yardboard!
Miller:
Hey, helmet!
The Yardboard.
Guymer:
So this is a Yardboard.
It's a all-terrain
downhill slider.
The snow's the best,
but I like to ride these ramps,
grass, dirt -- dirt, snow.
Here we go!
Putland: Get it!
Yeah! Nice!
Whoo!
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Cool.
[ Laughter ]
-Thank you.
Sharks, with our boards,
kids as young as three years old
can start dreaming of becoming
a true boarder some day,
starting
right in their own bedroom.
And, Sharks, you know,
when we're out in the surf,
we usually like to stay away
from you guys,
but today we're willing
to make an exception,
so who wants to jump on board
the Spooner team?
We've got some boards
for these guys.
-Cool, thank you.
-Robert.
-Lori.
-Thank you.
-Mr. Wonderful.
-Thank you, thank you.
So it's simulating, like,
riding a wave
or -- or going down a ski slope?
Exactly. Yeah.
O'Leary: Okay.
Tell us about the business.
Yes, It's a funny story.
I have a small surf shop.
I bought a dog igloo,
plastic dog igloo.
So I picked up my saw,
and I started
cutting this dog igloo,
and I said, "Man,
there's a skateboard deck."
So I make six of them,
just hand did them,
and I put wheels on them,
but they hit the ground,
they didn't work.
So they were just
laying like this
the whole time
in the back of the surf shop.
But kids just started
getting on them
and playing
and spinning and jumping.
Okay.
So then what happens?
You start realizing
kids want them?
Well --
Well, we went --
Cuban: Surf --
you have a surf shop, right?
So you have a place
to sell them.
We did $52,000.
We sold 1,100 boards
in 6 weeks.
Was that Christmas season?
Yes.
It was the Christmas --
yeah. Absolutely.
O'Leary: Were you demonstrating
the boards?
How do people know
what to do with them
when they just look at them?
We had, like 50 boards
out all around the kiosk.
-Wow.
-And you were demonstrating it?
We demoed, yeah.
What was the cost
for one board?
It was $45 for the small one
and $55 for the large one.
This is the Pro model
and you're on the Freestyle.
It's just
a little bit smaller --
This is $45?
-This is the small?
-Yes, sir. Yes.
Corcoran:
And what does it cost you
to make the $45 one
and the $55 one?
It's about $12
and $12.50.
O'Leary:
Those are good margins.
Those are good margins.
Yeah. I'd say.
At what volume are you
running those at today?
Last year,
we did $1.73 million
and this year we're on line
to do about $1.8 million.
Whoa.
And how are you selling
most of these, online?
Guymer:
65% of our business
is specialty retail stores,
toy stores.
There's about 1,200
really good ones that we're in.
That's our bread and butter,
'cause little kids
get on this board,
and as soon as they're on it,
they just immediately engage.
Randall, how did you go
to $1.7 million?
We really opened up
at the New York Toy Fair.
We got a huge booth.
2,000 --
This display is great.
So, is -- was that
your display at the toy show?
-Yes.
-We had a lot bigger one.
We had a big one.
We have a 30-foot one.
We started out
because we couldn't afford
to go to,
uh, the toy fair,
'cause it's
a lot of money to go.
We started out in the
physical education programs
all across the U.S.
We would sell 130 boards
at a normal school show,
and that would be enough
to pay the rent.
Oh, we're in over 15,000
elementary P.E. programs.
Where do you make these?
We make them
in San Diego.
We're made in America,
100%.
Do you pay yourselves
something?
We have a $60,000
a year salary for each of us.
From $1.8 million,
including your salaries,
what will the business
make as a profit?
We made about $400,000.
Oh, you guys
are making great money.
Good for you, guys.
Congrats.
Yeah.
There's no debt
on the business?
Putland: There's no debt.
There's no
other shareholders?
No. Just the three of us.
Randall, what's the problem?
[ Laughter ]
-What do you need the money for?
-Then what do you need us for?
What's missing?
Here's the --
You guys are missing!
We want you guys
to get on board!
But how would you use
the $400,000?
Doesn't sound like
you need it.
Well, you know, we've -- we've
stayed in our little niche,
which is
the specialty toy market.
We haven't really
branched out.
The New York Toy Fair,
where you went,
is not a specialty show.
Every major retailer
goes there.
Herjavec: There must have been
a big box retailer
that tried
to bring you in.
I-It was Toys"R"Us.
All: And what happened?
The thing is that we have
some fear going to the big box.
Why?
Because it takes
a lot of money to put that out.
You didn't do it
because you were concerned
to be
overextending yourself.
Exactly.
How do you guys
manage the business?
What do each of you do?
We're kind of unique
because we wear a lot of hats.
We manufacture
right in our own warehouse,
and we distribute
in our own warehouse, also.
Bernie runs
all the manufacturing.
Reuben is the sales
and marketing director.
I run the numbers.
I'm the CFO.
I love the whole story.
I love your distribution.
The schools -- You have
a fantastic business.
You make money.
You're doing
what you love to do,
and you get to work with people
that are fun and you love.
That's the American dream.
But here's the problem --
you bring an investor in,
any of us,
it just becomes
a different ballgame.
When you bring in
outside money,
there's a level
of discipline,
because it's not yours
anymore.
And is that something
that you want to do?
Cuban: Basically, it means
changing your lifestyle.
I-I'll give you
the perfect example.
There's a company that came on
here, "SURFSET Fitness."
We went out,
and sales started going like
this, this, this,
this, this, this, this.
But the amount of effort,
the amount of time
that they had to put in
started going up
even faster.
And it got to the point --
Mike and Sarah
got to the point,
were like,
"We don't have
our lives anymore.
We're not who we were."
They paid us back all of
our money, plus a return.
We still keep our equity.
Now they do it
at their own leisurely pace.
They weren't ready
to make that step.
I don't think you guys are ready
to make that lifestyle change.
While you're thinking about
all the spooky stuff
that Mark's talking about,
I'm gonna put an offer
on the table.
Wow.
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,
and Barbara has an offer coming
for Reuben, Randy, and Bernie's
recreational board, Spooner.
Cuban:
I don't think you guys are ready
to make that lifestyle change.
While you're thinking about
all the spooky stuff
that Mark's talking about,
I'm gonna put an offer
on the table.
Wow.
I'm gonna give you
half the money --
$200,000 for 8%,
but you have to get the other
Shark in for the balance.
All right?
Okay.
We --
That sounds great, Barbara.
Corcoran: But let me tell you
why I think you are ready.
When you declined to go ahead
with a big box store,
you did it for
the right business reasons.
That was
the right move.
You didn't have the cash
to put out or to cover it.
I mean, of course
you made a good judgment.
You've built your business
little by little.
There's my half offer...
Wow.
...but you have to get
the other half.
We love that, Barbara.
Thank you so much.
O'Leary:
All right, guys, look,
I'm interested
in partnering with her,
but I don't get up for 8%.
I'm not interested.
Except for him.
Any other Shark
other than he.
All right, then I'll take
the whole deal myself.
I'd structure the deal
a little differently.
I don't think
you should sell your equity,
and I'll tell you why.
You guys have had a relationship
for many years together.
It's like a family.
You bring a shareholder,
that's a whole
different ball game.
No, not with
the right shareholder.
I don't need your opinion,
Barbara.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm giving it anyway.
What I'm gonna tell you
is this --
Barbara.
What you need is capital
to fund this growth.
You need a banker
that basically believes
you can pay him back.
So here's
what I would do --
I would give you the $400,000
in tranches,
$100,000 at a time.
I'm gonna ask you
to pay me back at $2 a board.
I want to at least
get a return on my money,
as any banker would.
So, for example,
I give you the $400,000,
I want $800,000 back
at $2 a board.
If somebody buys the company,
I'd like 3% as an option,
but I don't have
any voting rights at all.
In other words,
you guys run the business.
Corcoran:
How complicated.
Would you like to call
your accountant on this?
Pretty simple, actually.
It's very simple.
It's actually a way
for you to keep your business
because what works
for you guys
is the culture
you've built and the trust
you have in each other
over all that time.
You don't need
a shareholder.
You don't want
a shareholder.
Herjavec: Well, the advantage
of that deal, actually,
is he's not a shareholder.
But he's got to get paid.
He's the Grim Reaper.
O'Leary: Any banker
has to get paid back.
You can call a banker
anything you'd like.
They got to get a return.
Do you feel like
that's quite a high interest?
[ Laughter ]
Well, it's gonna take me almost
five years to get it back.
Greiner: But you were saying
you're not really looking
for the cash necessarily.
-We're looking for --
-You need a strategic partner.
Yes.
Listen, guys, I've talked Mark
into the deal.
He'll take the other half
of the deal...
Really? Nice!
...which is the 8%
at the same valuation, $200,000.
And here's why I said yes,
because Tower Paddle Boards --
stand-up pa--
they're in San Diego.
You guys
can help each other,
but you got to say
"yes" or "no" right now.
Greiner: Well, so now
they're forcing your hands
so that you don't listen
to what the other Sharks say.
No, we're not.
It's just the perfect deal.
You can say "no," but it's just
up to you to say -- Yeah.
O'Leary:
You don't have to do any--
You can listen
to the other offers.
It's not -- You don't
have to do that.
You know, there could be
a better offer
waiting in the wings,
so...
I think Mark's gonna
give you the 10-second clock.
Here's the way I look at it --
there's no secrets anymore.
You all know what we do.
You all watch the show.
You all do your homework.
And if you say "no" to us,
we'll survive.
If you want to
take your chances with them --
But we don't want to do
all the back-and-forth.
Reuben, there's an offer
coming from Lori.
I would like
to give you an offer.
Wait.
Give them a moment.
I would --
If they listen
to your offer --
Barbara, why
do you keep talking?
Greiner:
I will give you --
Give them a moment of silence.
I'm going to give you
an offer --
Mark and Barbara
offered them
exactly what
they were looking for.
Exactly.
And I'm not -- I'm not saying
we're gonna stay in, guys.
Guys, I'm not saying
we're gonna stay in.
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it! Let's do it!
I'm gonna give you
an offer --
We thought it over,
and "Yes!"
Smart judgment.
Yeah, we're coming up.
-Yeah!
-Yeah.
Thank you so much,
you guys.
You didn't hear it.
Oh, yeah!
[ All talking ]
You know we, really appreciate
all your feedback.
You guys are awesome.
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you, guys.
Cuban:
Appreciate it, guys.
[ Laughs ]
-That was so awesome!
-I can't even believe it.
I can't believe
how awesome that was.
So, Barbara, you have a new
theory in the Shark Tank now.
What's that?
"We're gonna give people exactly
what they're looking for."
Hey, they were worth it.
[ Laughter ]
