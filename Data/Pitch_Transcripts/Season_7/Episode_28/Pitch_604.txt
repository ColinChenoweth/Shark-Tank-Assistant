Hello, Sharks.
My name is Kenny Lerner,
born and raised
in Brooklyn, New York,
living the dream
in Long Island.
My name
is Matthew Harris,
and I'm currently
in North Carolina.
Our company is the EVP.
We're looking for $50,000
for 20% equity in our company.
You've all seen
the devastation in the nation
and around the world
with floods.
And we definitely know
it's gonna come.
They've been coming more
and more frequently.
The thing is -- what to do
to protect the vehicles?
Does anybody have
a plan in place?
Probably not.
Most everybody has a safe
in their house
to secure their jewelry.
Maybe they have an emergency kit
in their car, in their boat,
in their plane,
in their helicopter.
But, really, nobody has
anything prepared for cars.
Well,
we have the solution,
and we want to show you
how it works.
But we need a volunteer.
And, Robert,
you're a car guy.
I'm a car guy.
Give us a hand.
You want to me to
drive it somewhere?
We're gonna have you
drive it somewhere.
All right.
Hop on in.
All right, so you're just
gonna get in here
and you're just gonna
ease the car in.
[ Car door closes ]
Start it up?
It should be started up.
The blue light's on?
[ Laughs ]
In drive?
He's the car guy.
Harris: Just ease it in.
Slowly.
Real slow.
Greiner: Bye, Robert!
-You're going into --
-Aah!
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
[ Chuckles ]
It's a car condom!
I can't see a thing.
That's all right.
Hey, how do I get out?
[ Laughs ]
Oh.
You're just gonna duck down
a little bit.
[ Chuckles ]
Ta-da!
Ta-da!
It was electric.
I didn't know it was on.
John:
Amazing. Amazing.
-It's so quiet.
-Amazing!
There it is.
Ta-da!
Now it's waterproof,
flood-proof.
So it's a ziplock baggie
for your car?
Basically.
And how much do you
charge for it?
We charge between
$250 and $350.
Is the idea,
as soon as it starts raining
and you <i>think</i> you're gonna
have a flood,
you drive your car into the bag?
I would think the weather
would be a little more extreme.
If you know a high tide
is coming or a Nor'easter,
you can't bring your car
to higher ground --
I like that as a car cover
in general
'cause the car covers
come off half the time.
So, Kenny,
I have a lot of cars.
I had a Ferrari,
a Lamborghini, or a Rolls-Royce,
and I bought a product
that looks
almost exactly like this
15 years ago.
It's a clear bubble.
Right.
You drive the car in.
It blows up around it.
They've been around
for a long, long time.
No electricity.
Oh, I see.
Your power's out.
You're stuck.
You need two people.
In less than 1 1/2 minutes,
your car is completely safe.
So, the difference between
your product and that product
is you simply zip it up
at the back.
Right.
What's your backgrounds?
What's your relationship?
Um, I'm a graphic artist
of 20 years.
Kenny was a repo guy.
Kenny, you must know Kevin.
You repoed something
from Kevin over time.
-You're still repoing?
-No, no, no.
I gave up repoing.
I'll tell you why
I gave up repoing.
I did it for 20 years,
and then at some point,
when the economy started
affecting middle-class people,
I started
getting assignments
for my neighbors
and my relatives,
and it was no longer
the scammers or the --
-Too close to home.
-The uptight banker.
Very close to home.
And -- And I felt my karma
shifting.
You didn't like taking
good people's cars away.
No, I didn't.
I cried every night.
Oh, that's brutal.
It was just a terrible,
terrible thing.
And I had just had enough.
Wow.
What do you estimate
the market for this is?
If everybody knew about it,
how many would buy it?
We live in New York.
We saw what happened with Sandy.
Yeah.
People lost their homes
and their cars
all in the same day.
Yeah.
A lot of people.
Had -- Had this product
been available at that time,
we think we could have done
a very, very brisk business.
What are your sales?
Our sales -- We coordinated
this entire project
being on here
with you guys.
Oh, this isn't gonna be
a good answer, is it?
No, it's gonna be
a very good answer.
All right, well,
let's have the answer!
Because you're gonna get in
really cheap on this deal
if you like the concept.
[ Laughter ]
-That's a new one.
-If you like the concept...
-I love you.
-It's a pre-sale.
We're practically
giving it away.
Hang on, Kenny,
is this a "get in on the ground
floor" opportunity?
This is "get in
on the ground floor."
This is a business...
'Cause, Kenny,
you have no sales, right?
We sold 150 of them for cash
like that till we ran out.
-That's it.
-How long did that take?
Pfft. Two weeks.
And you sold them where?
Body shops, car s--
car clubs,
anywhere where
people gather.
Guys, let me get --
let me get the ball rolling.
I don't see this as a business
that's going to
scale into a $10 million,
$20 million,
$50 million business.
I just don't.
You can build
a nice business,
but a nice business is not the
same as an investable business.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Kenny, I don't know if it's
gonna work. I-I'll tell you why.
People don't really think about
their car in an emergency.
People think about their home.
They think about
their loved ones.
The idea of buying this
in case there's a flood,
I think it's gonna be
challenging.
When something does happen,
for them to go buy it,
it's the last thing
on their mind.
I wish you all the best.
-Thank you very much.
-I'm out.
-I appreciate it.
Thank you.
I'm not a car enthusiast.
It's not really my thing.
Um, I think your packaging
there, while it attracts my eye,
I can't tell well exactly
what it is from a quick glance.
Okay.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
O'Leary: I like this.
Here's what I'll do.
I'll give you the 50K
and I want 30 bucks a unit.
John: Hmm.
It's a royalty deal.
You get the 50K
to build some inventory.
Um, obviously I'll help you
get the word out.
Go sell for two weeks
and you make your 50K, right?
You know. Can we sell --
What's your offer?
My offer is very simple.
I give you the $50,000
and I get $30 a bag forever.
-Forever.
-Forever.
Perpetuity.
Kevin is back!
Thank you.
[ Laughter ]
The point is, I get --
-He's the repo man.
-The reason this works,
and you can talk to
any of my royalty guys,
they love it
because my whole team
is incentivized to sell units.
That's all we do.
We crank up our social media.
I go on television with it.
I talk about how great you are.
And I save cars, which is nice.
And I put one on my car.
Is that what you'll do
with this product?
You'll go on TV,
you'll promote it?
Oh, yeah. I go nuts.
I'm incentivized
to sell a lot of units.
So, what do you need
the money for?
Forever's a long time,
Kenny.
It is.
The money is secondary,
Daymond.
They're selling
car condoms forever.
We need you guys.
Harris: Yeah.
We need credibility.
We need connections.
Do you have a better offer,
Daymond?
I might.
And Matthew, you're doing
something else, right?
Okay, well, then, get it out.
I'll give you the 50 grand
for...
and we'll split the business
1/3, 1/3, and 1/3.
And what would your marketing
plan be, please?
Oh, you want me to sit here
and lay out a marketing plan?
I'm just curious
what your ideas are.
Daymond,
do you have a résumé?
-[ Laughs ]
-I know.
I should submit the résumé.
I'll -- I think I should
actually interview Daymond
before he takes this job.
[ Laughter ]
Do you have experience
in the retail market?
Um, I might. I might know
somebody who knows somebody.
[ Laughs ]
Unfortunately, when you sell it
to a large company one day,
you will leave 1/3
of the profits away.
I get nothing.
Cuban: And unfortunately,
you won't be able to sell it
to that large company
'cause they're gonna say,
"Royalties forever?
Are you kidding me?"
No, no. I --
You'll never see your company
with a royalty on it.
I might --
I'm a reasonable man.
Does that royalty stop at
a sale when we all cash out?
Well, I have to get some return
on my investment, right?
[ Herjavec chuckles ]
How about this deal?
'Cause you're -- you're
a reasonable guy.
All right, Kenny?
I look at it this way.
[ Laughs ]
It's the setup.
Wait for it.
Wait. I'm thinking.
-That's a first, too.
-It doesn't make --
It doesn't make sense for me
to give you 50K
and then just get 50K back.
Why am I doing that?
Right.
I'll give you the $50,000.
When I get 200K back, I'm gone.
So I got the thing
off the ground.
-I sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.
-Hmm.
And so the royalty stops
after I recoup $200,000.
But what happens, then,
when you need a real partner?
I mean, guys, that's --
That is a real partner.
That's concerning to me
'cause right now,
he will give you the injection.
Why do you -- This guy is asking
for 1/3 of your business.
Yeah, and you want a partner
with skin in the game.
Yeah, think of it, guys.
You said that you wanted
somebody you could turn to.
For -- For source of revenue
or source of cash,
okay, you can argue
Kevin's is okay.
But when he gets his 1,000 --
you sell your 1,000 units,
he's gone with the wind.
Yeah, that's not true, Kenny.
He's gonna be really --
-We'll work out a new deal.
-Yeah, 'cause what's his return?
He has no equity.
He's gonna be really
incentivized to drive the sales.
They came in here looking
for a quick --
1,000 unites. He said 1,000
units and he's out completely.
Kevin's your guy.
I will make sure you'll
sell 1,000 units quickly.
And I'm not gonna try
to make sure you sell
1,000 units quickly.
I like your partnership.
I'm gonna try to make sure
you sell 100,000 units quickly.
-'Cause I'll be a partner.
-Ooh.
You've thought about it.
You got two offers.
What would you like to do?
I appreciate your offer,
but I'm going with Brooklyn.
Ah!
What?
Smart guys.
I appreciate that, man.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, all.
Congrats, guys.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Kevin, you didn't
get that offer.
You have to go inside there.
[ Laughs ]
That was rough.
Whew.
Lerner: I used to be in the
business of taking cars legally.
And now I'm in the business
of saving cars,
and it's a very,
very good feeling,
and I'm glad to have
this opportunity.
