Tichauer:
My name's Adam Tichauer,
and I'm the founder and Head
Camper of Camp No Counselors.
Camp No Counselors
is an all-inclusive
sleepaway camp for grown-ups...
Dodgeball!
...where adults get to play
like kids again,
competing in activities
like dodgeball,
three-legged races, zip-lining,
and we even have
a giant Slip N Slide.
[ People cheering ]
I wasn't always a Head Camper.
My first job was in finance
in New York City
working in a cubicle.
I was working around the clock
and just needed to get away
for a weekend.
I decided to rent out
a sleepaway camp
and invite my friends
and they told their friends.
90 people signed up,
and by the end of the weekend,
we were all best friends, and I
knew I needed to do it again.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
My business means everything
to me.
I quit my cushy job in order
to take a risk and do this.
I can see the beginning steps
of something really great
happening,
and I can tell that
it's positively impacting lives.
The ability to let go
and be whoever you want to be
is something that kids
get to do every day.
We want to bring that feeling
to adults,
and camp is the perfect place
to do it.
My name's Adam Tichauer,
and I'm the founder and Head
Camper of Camp No Counselors.
I'm seeking a $300,000
investment in exchange for
7.5% equity ownership
in my business.
Now, Sharks,
please close your eyes
as I take you on a journey
back in time.
Imagine yourself
as a 10-year-old
stepping onto the bus for your
first summer at sleepaway camp.
Mmm.
This is gonna be
the summer of your life.
Now, please open up your eyes.
[ Laughs ]
What I've done is I've bottled
up that feeling and experience,
but I'm delivering it to adults.
I introduce to you
Camp No Counselors,
your all-inclusive
sleepaway camp for grown-ups.
At Camp No Counselors,
we rent out sleepaway camps
in their off-season
and invite adults
to come back to camp
for fun-filled weekend getaways
with their best friends.
During the days,
you'll play like carefree kids
doing all of the fun,
classic camp activities
like archery and wakeboarding,
rock climbing, and zip-lining.
And in the nights, you'll roast
marshmallows around a campfire
and party like grown-ups,
dancing in the stars to
unforgettable bands and deejays.
I've got a little treat
for you guys
to get your in
the right mind-set.
-S'mores!
-S'mores.
-You smell it, don't you?
-[ Laughs ]
So, we start our mornings
usually with Bloody Marys
and mimosas.
-Whoa.
-Ooh.
Here, you can grab a beer,
and don't forget your postcard
to write home.
There you are.
Thank you.
Here you go, Lori --
a mimosa.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
-A s'more. You're welcome.
Here you go.
You know, Adam,
you are one class act.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
-Cheers, everyone.
-Mm.
Welcome to Camp No Counselors.
Greiner:
So, this is very clever.
Where are you doing this?
Currently,
we're doing them in New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago,
and Nashville.
Are they in rural areas,
or...?
So, we work directly with
summer camps,
so they're usually, you know,
a couple hours outside
of the city.
We provide round-trip
charter transportation.
We provide open bar
all weekend long.
All of the meals,
all of the accommodations,
all of the activities, and it's
a very turnkey operation.
How much is it?
It $478 on average
for the all-inclusive
three-night weekend.
Are you using
the actual counselors
that work there during
the normal season
-to do this for you?
-Yes, we are.
So, we -- we work directly with
the camp's infrastructures.
So, we work with the camps
right before the kids arrive
and right after the kids leave,
so it's incremental income
for the camp owners.
So, your only overhead
is marketing and the rental.
-That's it.
-Like what?
-What's the average age?
-Give us an idea.
Average age is 30 years old.
I used to be
a camp counselor.
-So was I.
-So was I.
My speciality was
the long portage.
-No, no, no. Long portage.
-At what camp?
-15-day trips.
-Emma Kaufmann Camp.
I'm a masterful canoeist.
I'd take 20, 30 people out.
-We portage for miles.
-Oh, my God.
But here's what I learned.
Here's what I learned.
Sure.
It sucks.
[ Laughs ]
There's a lot of insects,
you get eaten alive.
It's tough work.
Today, I like a mint
on my pillow when I go to bed.
[ Laughs ]
I don't want to be anything
near a camp.
I don't know why these people
would do this.
Let's go back to the business
for a second.
Tichauer: Sure.
What were your total sales
last year?
Last summer, we did four camps
and we grossed $160,000.
And now this year,
we're doing 11 camps,
we're having 1,800 people,
and to date,
we've grossed $730,000
and are projecting to do
$800,000 this year
with a profit of $165,000.
We're starting to do
some corporate retreats,
but the biggest way
that we're gonna scale it
is do simultaneous camps
over a given weekend.
And so, what's your typical
camp cost you direct?
If it's $478 that
somebody pays...
Right.
Our cost is $278.
Our profit is $200 per person.
Is one of your risks
that the camp itself says,
"I've watched you do this
three years in a row.
What do I need you for?
Why don't I just
do this myself?"
Tichauer:
I've created the demand for it.
Time Out New York
did a piece on us
that had 560,000 people
share that on Facebook,
and they have never had
that many people
-share an article before.
-That's huge.
Adam, have you raised
any external money?
We've taken on loan of $100,000,
but besides that, nothing.
Adam, I don't see anything wrong
with your business model.
I think it makes a lot of sense.
I particularly hate camping.
I've made a rule
in my "Shark Tank" deals
that I use the products
that I invest in.
I would never go there.
I just don't want to even think
about this idea. I'm out.
All right. Thank you.
What do you need us for?
Obviously you know
"Shark Tank"
is an amazing PR vehicle,
right?
Right.
One is the capital
to scale our infrastructure
into new markets
and to market and create demand
in these new markets.
But you have enough profits
for that.
This year,
we'll do $165,000 in profit,
and that'll be enough
to hire the teams
to do these new markets.
That will not be enough.
We really want to scale
this thing quickly.
Next year,
I'm planning on doing 30 camps.
Yeah, but it's not
ringing true, Adam.
Every camp
is self-cash flowing.
In the event that we try a
market where we don't have that,
we need to put up-front capital
into those advertising
and public relations campaigns
in those local markets.
Herjavec: But how much?
How much does that cost?
Let's say I said to you,
"Let's go to Chicago."
How much would you spend?
We spent $2,000 on advertising
for Chicago this year.
Okay, but that -- I think
that's Mark's point.
I'm sitting here
the whole time thinking
what a great business
for you.
How do you invest
in this?
Again,
we need this up-front capital
to get into these new markets
and the-- th--
But you just said you spent
$2,000 to get into Chicago.
That's it.
We only did one camp
in Chicago.
I want to do three, four,
and five camps
starting next year
in these new markets.
But you don't really need
money to do that, do you?
But you're generating
that cash flow. You're
generating that cash.
Because all you're doing
is renting a place.
Adam, I think -- I think what
we're really getting at is --
Sure.
...if your valuation
is $4 million...
$4 million.
...and you did $800,000
this year...
Yes.
...and you're offering us
7.5%,
it's -- all you're trying
is basically gold dig.
Adam's motives in bringing
his sleepaway camp for adults,
Camp No Counselors,
into the Tank.
Adam, I think -- I think what
we're really getting at is,
if your valuation
is $4 million...
$4 million.
...and you did $800,000
this year...
Yes.
...and you're offering us
7.5%,
it's -- all you're trying
is basically gold dig.
Because you're basically
saying right now
you don't really need
anything from us.
I'm here to close this deal
because I want to scale
this operation
so we can grow a lot quicker
than we are right now.
W-W-Well, then,
why do you put that --
Why do you feel
that valuation is accurate?
The way I valued it is based on
next year's profit
to be $800,000 in profit,
so at a 5x multiple.
Can I give you the money
next year?
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary:
Adam, just out of interest,
how are you planning on
returning this capital?
What are you gonna do?
When -- If --
If and when the business sells,
since we'll all be partners,
we'll all reap the benefits
together.
So, you think you can sell
this as an event business
to somebody that's gonna scale
it even beyond what you do?
Correct.
This could be a Tough Mudder,
this could be a Color Run,
this could be in every country,
in every market
across the world.
By 2019, I'm projecting
to do $35 million in sales.
Um, I'm not interested
in a long-term exit.
I like to ring the register
every quarter or every year.
Right.
And I think you have some
liabilities ahead of you.
You mentioned a couple
of Tough Mudders
and things like that,
but those aren't
overnight experiences
where alcohol is involved.
Right.
And with those two issues,
Uh, I just don't think
it's for me, so I'm out.
Thank you.
Greiner: Here's the bottom line
for me.
I think it's very clever,
seems like a lot of fun,
but I think the valuation's
definitely out of whack.
I just don't find it
investable for me.
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
I love camping.
I think it's a great idea.
But money is not always the
solution to grow every business.
Right.
And I -- I don't see how my
money is gonna add value to you.
I'm out.
Thank you.
O'Leary:
One Shark left, right?
Adam, I-I think
it's a brilliant idea.
-Um...
-Mark, I would love to --
I'm not here to beg or whatever.
I would love you
as a partner in this.
Man, we would take it over.
Well, you're -- you're gonna
take it over.
-I mean, look --
-I know.
-You're a party promoter, right?
-I want you in my corner.
-I want you in my corner.
-Yeah.
No, I'm serious.
I'm serious here.
At the end of the day,
you're a party promoter.
Let him beg.
I like it.
The issue is that 7.5%
is just nothing.
If you're making $1 million
a year in profit
and you start to
pay distributions,
I get 75 grand a year.
Right.
It doesn't matter for you.
It's just not --
It doesn't move the needle.
There's just not
enough upside.
So, ho-- One,
how do we make it an upside deal
so you're --
you're excited about it?
I mean, if you give me 25%
of the business, I'll do it.
I can't do that.
Yeah.
You know, it's just --
It's not a knock on you, right?
It's a compliment.
Is that an offer, Mark?
The only way I would go
as high as 25%
is if everyone came on board.
Herjavec: For $300,000?
Yeah, you know what?
That just makes it sound shady.
-Because I want --
-And so --
Again, because I want to
scale this thing
with the best people
in the -- in the business.
Yo-- I'm out.
Thanks.
Thank you so much, Adam.
Thank you. All right.
I like the groveling.
I like groveling.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.
Good idea.
Kevin, did you just always
get beat up at camp?
What's a portage?
How do you not know what
portaging is?
-What is it?
-I don't know what that is.
You carry the canoe
on your --
It's when you carry the canoe
by yourself.
Between lake to lake.
Between lake to lake.
Up the mountain.
See that mountain?
I can't see you running with
a canoe on your head.
And you know what?
While you're doing it,
beavers are snapping at you.
