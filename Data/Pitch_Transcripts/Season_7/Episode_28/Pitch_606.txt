Hi, Sharks.
My name is Rachel Zietz,
and my company
is Gladiator Lacrosse.
I am seeking $100,000
in exchange for 15% equity
in my company.
Lacrosse is my passion,
and because
of my competitive nature,
I'm always striving to be
the best --
on the field,
at school, and in business.
My parents weren't huge fans
of me throwing
my dirty lacrosse balls
against the walls of our house,
and they definitely didn't
want me breaking any windows.
So, I bought a backyard lacrosse
goal and a rebounder.
I spent hundreds of dollars
only to have them fall apart
very quickly.
I knew I wasn't the only
lacrosse player out there
who was let down
by the available equipment.
So, I decided to design
and manufacture my own,
and thus, Gladiator Lacrosse
was born.
At Gladiator Lacrosse,
we know what you need to take
your game to the next level.
We provide affordable equipment
that withstands
the constant punishment
that competitive
lacrosse players deliver.
Lacrosse is the fastest-growing
sport in America.
And who wants to dominate this
space with Gladiator Lacrosse?
If you would allow me,
I would like to provide
a quick demonstration.
Let's see it.
So, the rebounder allows you
to practice your throwing
and catching skills.
It's a trampoline-like surface,
and you just kind of
throw against it.
And then the goal.
I rip some nice shots on there.
[ Laughs ] Good job.
Would anyone like to try it?
John: I've never played
lacrosse before.
Cuban: Go for it.
All right.
Zietz: Here.
It's super easy.
Okay. So.
[ Laughs ]
-Whoo!
-Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
That was really good.
I'm not gonna --
I'm not gonna test my luck.
[ Laughter ]
Hey, hey, hey.
Good job, buddy.
Yeah. So, you haven't invented
a new product.
You've invented
a better product?
Zietz:
A better version, yes.
I was very frustrated
'cause I would buy
my competitors' products
and they would constantly rust
and tear and be completely
destroyed, like, after a month.
How old are you?
I am 15 today.
Get out of here!
And you're only 15?!
Thank you.
How old were you when
you started this?
I was 12 years old
when I started this business.
12?!
Yeah.
Oh, back in the day.
[ Sarcastically ] You're not
doing enough with your life.
You got to get going.
[ Laughs ]
Who helped you
and how did you figure out
manufacturing
in a better way?
Well, luckily, both my parents
are entrepreneurs,
so I was able to seek them out
for advice on business.
I also participated in
the Young Entrepreneurs Academy
and I met a lot of mentors
that helped me along the way.
Did you parents put
any money in, or...?
Yeah, they gave me a loan
for $30,000 that is paid back.
Yeah!
And how much --
And how much have you sold,
over what period of time?
In total, I've done
over $300,000 in sales.
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah, baby.
-Wow.
-That's awesome.
And that's in about three,
four years?
That's since January of 2014.
Good for you.
How do you sell it?
I sell on Amazon,
eBay, my site.
I sell in a couple
of specialty lacrosse stores,
and I also go
to local tournaments
and I sell there, too.
What's so unique about
your products
that differentiates it
from your competitors?
Well, I've become trusted
and known for being high-quality
and an affordable price
in the lacrosse community.
Not only am I the owner of this
company, I'm a client, as well.
[ Laughs ]
I purchase these products.
I use them every day
to improve <i>my</i> game.
Unlike my competitors
who make products
for all different kinds
of sports
and probably don't
play lacrosse.
How big's the market,
the entire market?
It's -- The entire market
is, like, well in excess
of over $100 million.
$100 million.
So, y-you're basically 1% of it.
What -- How big do you think
you can get to?
I hope to dominate
the entire market,
but I feel that as I expand
my product line,
people will not only
just buy the rebounder,
but they'll buy the rebounder
and let's say, a pair of socks,
or the balls to go with it.
Add-ons and things
of that nature.
How much does it
cost to make?
The rebounder costs $66.
The goal, $38.50.
And what do you sell it
for, Rachel?
I retail the rebounder
for $249.95
and the goal I retail
for $149.95.
How busy are you with
running the business?
I do have excellent
time-management skills,
as I've been able to...
[ Laughter ]
That's one of us, yeah.
Yeah. I've been able to manage
school, business, lacrosse.
But I also have one employee
who handles fulfilling orders,
does marketing,
and takes customer calls
while I'm in class.
Full-time employee?
Who is that?
She's a college student.
So, Rachel, you got
a lot of stuff going on.
Walk me through
a typical day.
Yeah.
So, at 6:00, I'll wake up,
and I'll start
working on the business.
Then I'll take the bus
to school.
I have some time to work there.
[ Chuckles ]
Then I get to school.
During my free periods
and lunch periods,
I'll handle customer calls,
or I'll fulfill orders.
And then I go to
lacrosse practice.
Are you captain?
I am.
I figured. [ Laughs ]
And when I get home,
I have dinner with my family,
and then I go to my room.
I'll do homework.
Very important.
[ Chuckles ]
And then I'll work on
the business some more.
Then the phone will
start ringing from Asia.
-[ Chuckles ] At 2:00 a.m.
-Yes, I do.
I take Skype calls at night.
What are you gonna do with
the $100,000, Rachel?
Well, I need the money
to increase my online
and retail distribution.
Actually, right now
I'm in discussions with Walmart
about selling there.
Secondly, I want to create
a sales team
to go out to these tournaments
and sell at the tournaments
nationwide.
And the third thing I want to do
is I want to increase
my product line to include
things like sticks, goggles.
-Well, can you --
-For inventory.
You need the money
for inventory.
Inventory
and to increase the channels.
Let's say you could get
to 30% of the market.
That's not unreasonable
for a quality brand.
That's
a $30 million business.
No way on Earth
you can do that between school
and dinners with your family
and everything else.
That's the --
That's the challenge here.
So, at the end of the day,
who runs the show?
Well, I'm going to be the head.
I'm gonna be the visionary
and the strategic person who
watches over all my employees.
As I expand, I will hire people
to handle the specific,
day-to-day aspects
of the business.
I-I think the fact that you are
the brand, you play the game,
it's so credible.
When people look at
which product to buy,
they're gonna buy it
from a player.
You know, I'm really torn.
Uh, I'm really torn.
It's sort of a hobby for you
right now, with great potential.
That's what it is.
I'm just torn.
But I'm out.
Thank you.
Cuban:
You deserve a lot of credit.
You found a niche.
Brilliant.
But the challenge for me
is I don't know lacrosse.
So for that reason,
I'm out.
But I think what you're doing
is phenomenal.
You set a great example,
so you deserve a lot of credit.
Thank you.
Your presentation
was fantastic.
But I just don't think you need
the money at this point.
I'm out. Thank you.
What happens if you
don't get the money?
Well, I'm going to continue
working harder, and I'm gonna --
have to keep reinvesting back
to get the containers.
I have to order
more containers.
I think that's the best thing
for you to do.
I think I'd be doing you
a disservice by investing money
and taking part of your precious
company that you've built.
So, with that, I'm out.
Thank you.
Greiner: You know,
I look at you --
It affirms what
I've always believed --
Women were built
for business.
I-I'm actually
humbled by you,
because there's nothing here
I would say you should change.
It's like you're doing
everything right.
I don't think that
I could add value,
because it's a space
I don't know.
For that reason,
I'm going out.
But I'm super proud of you,
and everything you've done.
Thank you.
Congratulations,
and happy birthday.
Right. Do it yourself.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You did a great job.
Greiner: Happy birthday.
Thank you.
