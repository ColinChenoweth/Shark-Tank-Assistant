Hi, Sharks.
My name is Brad Baker.
I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio,
and my company is VPCabs.
I'm seeking
a $200,000 investment
in exchange for 10%
of my company.
Everyone loves
the classic pinball games --
the lights, the sounds,
the clack of the bumpers.
Pinballs bouncing to and fro.
But then the digital revolution
happened,
and pinball faced extinction.
VPCabs puts hundreds
of pinball games, old and new,
at the mercy
of your pinball prowess.
By completely replacing
the physical guts and components
of a traditional pinball cabinet
with a high-end gaming computer
and multiple
HD LED playing screens,
you'll be able to choose
from hundreds of pinball games
in just a matter of seconds.
With advanced physics coding...
[ Sighs ]
O'Leary: Just the biggest moment
of your life.
Don't screw it up.
[ Chuckles ]
With advanced physics coding
and our feedback system,
you'll feel like you're
playing the actual game.
[ Flippers clicking ]
All the clicks, knocks,
sounds, and shakes
are right at your fingertips.
You can even shake and tilt
the machine
to simulate
your last-minute table bumps.
With VPCabs, you get hundreds of
games at a fraction of the cost.
And with our web-connected
platform,
you'll be able
to make the machine
easy to operate and to update.
Life is a buffet,
and pinball can be, too.
So, Sharks, who's hungry?
Would anybody like to
come up and try?
Cool stuff, Brad.
All right, all right.
It's on.
[ Laughs ]
Baker: You can choose
from a bunch of games.
Just go ahead and hit
the "Launch" button.
[ Flippers clicking ]
This is actually better
than traditional pinball.
-Kind of cool.
-You like that?
-It's pretty cool.
-Cool.
-That's cool.
-Is it cool?
It's cool.
Come look at this one.
-How's the old one feel?
-Where's the -- [Chuckles]
Because it was built in
a digital platform...
Whoo!
...it'll do more than just
your classic pinball.
Like,
on some of the games,
you'll go from playing
pinball to
chasing somebody
around the screen.
-Many questions.
-Ahh.
[ Laughs ]
Baker: [ Laughs ] Excellent.
I have many answers.
I'm still on
my first ball, man!
Okay.
O'Leary: So, Brad,
is this play for consumers,
or do you want to put it into
commercial establishments?
What's the plan?
I've owned an audio/video
business for about 15 years,
and my brother
owns a huge arcade.
One day, he asked me,
"Hey, I heard about this cool
digital-pinball technology.
I've got an old pinball cabinet
that doesn't work.
You think you could put
some monitors in it
and we could turn it into
a cool game?"
So I thought,
"Man, that's awesome."
So, I got a cabinet
and gutted it out,
and we put some monitors in it
and had a really rough,
rudimentary
digital-pinball machine.
It just really snowballed
from there.
People from the arcade
were like, "Oh, my gosh.
Could you build this for me?"
And within a few weeks,
I had, like,
an order
for eight pinball machines.
And...
the economy at that point,
in my home-theater business,
was-- wasn't that great.
We're in Cincinnati.
The market was still recovering.
And, uh,
we had been struggling in --
in the home-theater business.
And, uh, we were, uh...
Sorry.
We almo--
We almost lost our house.
Um, and, uh, I was charging,
like,
$4,000 or $5,000 to make
a machine for somebody.
And, uh -- And from the money
that I made off those machines,
I was able to go my bank
a week before
they were gonna foreclose
and pay my mortgage in cash.
Wow.
Uh, it saved my family.
So, you sold eight machines
to start.
What are your total sales
today?
So, in a year and a half, uh,
we have done...200 units.
And, uh, close to $750,000.
-Whoa.
-How many macho-- Wow.
What does one machine cost?
So, our machines vary
from -- right now,
from $3,000 to $9,500.
-Wow.
-What?
This machine here retails
for $7,995.
And we sell this machine 50:1.
How are you selling these?
We do trade shows.
Lots of trade shows.
In a two-day trade show,
our best two-day is $100,000.
So, Brad, walk us through
your business model.
Let's -- I understand
you're selling these
to consumers direct.
Yes.
So I'm assuming a 50% margin
on that at least?
The way that it works
right now -- uh, for example,
our $7,995 machine,
uh, my bill of materials
on that machine is $2,686.
Big question.
Protectable?
There is not anybody
that we know of
that's anywhere near
what we're doing.
We've got a really high-end
gaming computer in there
with video cards,
we use 8 to 16 gigabytes of RAM.
We custom-cut our own cabinets
on our own CNC machine
that we designed so that our
displays slide in a certain way.
So you guys are
a systems integrator?
Yes.
Are you making a profit
right now?
Well, so, for 2014,
I showed a net profit
of only about 12,000 bucks.
Wow.
Okay.
What was your gross profit?
-Now let's add -- add back in --
-What was your gross profit?
Gross prof-- profit
was around $70,000.
That's it?
So, about 10%.
Yeah. And, you know,
we were --
Is there any cost
to the software?
We pay a license fee,
uh, for --
How much, roughly?
I-It's -- It's up to
15% of the sale...
-Whoa.
-...of the sale of the game.
Okay. So, $2,600,
plus you pay
a software-licensing fee
of another $1,000.
You're at $4,000.
You're selling them at $8,000.
Retail, yes.
And we push them at trade shows
for 6,000 bucks.
Are you taking any cash out
to pay yourself?
Uh, I have not paid myself.
If you pay yourself,
a normalized salary for you
of, let's say, 80 grand,
this business
isn't profitable yet.
It -- It is not profitable yet.
I am putting every dime back in.
I'm probably buying things
to grow the business
that I maybe should have
waited a little longer for.
And I believe we have a product
that can scale beyond
just your average pinball buyer,
because a lot of people
are afraid to buy pinballs
because of the maintenance
and because it's only one game
and their kid's gonna get
bored with it really quick.
So, Brad,
I own 10 pinball machines.
Fantastic.
And you can buy them
for about $4,000 or $5,000,
and they feel great.
Yours felt better.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
But, Brad,
here's the problem.
The kids, they didn't get
the same excitement from it
as they do with
online games.
When we go to trade shows,
we have lines at our booth, and
kids are all the way around it.
Kids aren't gonna buy this.
You're gonna sell it
to old guys like me
who like pinball
because it's cooler.
Parents are buying this
for their kids nonstop.
For me -- clever idea.
Great idea.
I'm glad that it helped you
get out of a difficult position.
Baker: Sure, sure.
But for kids, 'cause
they all have little devices
with thousands of games,
and they can hold it
and carry with them.
And so I don't think
they care about
the huge, big, interactive
experience all the time.
I don't see this
scaling really huge
because there's just so much out
there in gaming people can do,
and so easily.
Digital pinball is
the future of pinball.
It's changing
the pinball market.
And for that reason, I'm out.
And w-- Thank you.
Thanks for your time, Lori.
I have to bring reality
to all your enthusiasm, okay?
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]
It is not worth $2 million.
It's nowhere near that.
I respectfully disagree
with you.
It's a break-even business
right now.
You really have no way
of paying me back.
I hope you can continue
to sell them one at a time,
but it's not investable.
Uh,
I appreciate your input.
I'm out.
Thank you.
First of all, the guy's been in
business for a year and a half.
You're building
the business.
Who cares what the profitability
is at this point,
and who cares what
it's worth?
Nothing proprietary at all.
That's not true.
Baker: I believe we will be able
to get some patents.
Zero.
Here's the challenge.
Absolutely nothing.
Here's the challenge
with the business.
You don't make the most vital
component of it the software.
I'd love to get there.
Tell me, how are you gonna
go from 200 machines to 400?
We want to push trade shows
further out west.
I really want to
get into distributors
like the stores
we're selling now.
They love our machines.
We're only in a few stores,
so --
And there's a thousand
of these stores.
Brad, look. I don't think
the kids are gonna buy it.
I don't think it's
gonna go that way.
I wish you would have
come up with a strategy
to find guys like me.
Can I te-- say one thing?
With the commercial side
of this business,
what has happened in the past
is most all of the big
arcades -- Dave &amp; Buster's,
Chuck E. Cheese,
all the big ones --
they've gotten rid of pinball
because they're
too much maintenance.
And we have the ability to
get back into those places...
I don't agree with you.
I don't --
...in a big way.
And that's a hu--
Brad, I don't share your vision
for the commercial side of it.
This is a high-end,
vintage type of business.
I'd really like to do both. I
love what I'm doing here, but --
I'm out.
I'm trying so hard
to find a reason to say yes.
All right.
Right.
Just say it.
Let's do this.
Oh, I wish it was
that simple.
I disagree with Robert.
While you'll sell
to vintage stuff,
that's
the low-hanging fruit.
But what I see is a platform
for gaming
that's much more tactical
than using a joystick at home.
-A platform? A --
-Let's bring on a programmer
and make our own games.
Well, but see, but that's part
of the problem. Right.
You got to be kidding me.
Kids are gonna walk up to
this thing and play it?
Like crazy.
Every show, like nuts.
You know, that's the difference
between us, Robert.
It's huge. It's crazy.
You see something, and you
can be 1,001, and that's cool.
I see something,
and I want to be the first
at doing something
to change the game.
I'm changing it.
But you're not, though,
and that's the problem.
Narrator:
Three Sharks are out.
Mark and Daymond
are Brad's last chances
for a deal for his
digital-pinball machine company,
VPCabs.
The direction
you've told me is not it.
Your vision is for
a bigger business.
If you had come in and you had
lots of technical expertise
and said, "Here's where we are
as a platform,
and here's where
the custom is."
But you don't have that.
I would have to do it.
That's the problem,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you for your time.
Whew!
Thank you for your interest,
too.
Appreciate it.
Daymond:
Now, I'm not as old as some
of the other Sharks up here.
-[ Chuckles ]
-So, I was raised,
and I bought a couple
of those games --
Donkey Kong, Crazy Climber.
They were digital games.
You know, he's kind of --
You know, when he was young,
there was pinball
that was out.
When he was young, there
was "Catch a Cavegirl"
or something like that.
[ Laughter ]
But, um, I believe that I may
be able bring value.
I have a company, Craig's,
in creating these electronics.
Can you take
your expertise
and not have to do
all this building
and go out and hit every single
door and things like that...
Absolutely. Absolutely.
...and then I will
make the product.
That -- That's what I do best,
and that's what I love to do.
I love talking to people.
I love showing them my passion
for what I'm doing.
All right.
You know, I'm gonna
take a gamble here.
Y-- Because of -- You know,
because we can make this with --
with my company Craig's.
$200,000 for 30%.
Don't even think about it.
Will you -- Will you do 20%?
Oh.
-I'm willing to go 20%.
-Let him think.
Please. I'm gonna k--
I'm gonna kill it for you.
$200,000, 25%, we have a deal.
Deal.
-Done.
-Good job.
All right.
-Congrats, man.
-Thank you.
-Appreciate it.
-All right, man.
Congrats, Brad.
-Thank you.
-Congrats, man.
-Thanks, guys.
-Bye.
Whoo!
It's just overwhelming that
someone would believe in me,
a little guy
from Cincinnati, Ohio.
My wife's gonna be
really excited.
[ Voice breaking ] Uh,
we've worked so hard on this.
And it is -- You know,
it wasn't a make-or-break deal,
but it was just
one of those deals
that this is gonna help us
get where we need to be.
