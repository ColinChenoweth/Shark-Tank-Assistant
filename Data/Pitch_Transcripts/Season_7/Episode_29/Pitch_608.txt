I'm Tania.
I'm from Boston.
And I'm seeking $50,000
for 20% of my company.
I know. I don't look excited
to be here at all.
[ Laughter ]
I am on the inside.
It's just that my back
is killing me,
I have a splitting headache,
I'm so bloated,
this dress may pop off,
and I'm exceptionally hot.
That's right, Sharks.
I'm talking about PMS.
90% of women suffer from one or
more of the 150 symptoms of PMS,
and those symptoms can last
an average of 7 to 10 days
out of the month.
Think about that number,
Mr. Wonderful.
That's a third of your year
where you'd be crankier
than usual.
[ Chortles ]
But I have a solution --
PMS Bites.
PMS Bites are delicious
and healthy bite-size snacks
specifically designed for women
when we need them most.
They're made with all-natural,
vegan,
and gluten-free ingredients,
and they contain a blend
of herbs
that women commonly take
for bloating,
cramping, and irritability.
PMS Bites are the perfect snack
to help women take
those 122 days back
and satisfy cravings
without guilt.
Sharks, who's ready to take
the bite out of PMS?
Greiner: We all are.
[ Laughs ]
-And I have samples for you.
-We're ready to try them!
-Okay.
-That's what I mean.
Herjavec: What's the most
common symptom, Tania?
-I would say irritability.
-Lori,
we know you need it.
-Oh, Robert.
-Wow.
-Thank you.
[ Light laughter ]
Oh, I love the packaging.
Look at the package --
very cute.
The main ingredients are dates,
almond butter,
and gluten-free oats.
Herjavec:
These are really good.
-Great candy. It's great.
-Thank you.
They're 50 calories each.
-They're pretty good.
-They're very good.
Thank you very much.
How many have you sold?
So, I have $13,400.07
in sales.
-[ Laughs ]
-Can you be a little
more specific?
How do you get the 7 cents
in sales?
Every penny counts, Mark.
[ Chuckles ]
I have been selling
for two months
and executing my retail strategy
for two months.
How long did it take you
to have $13,000 in sales?
Uh, seven months ago.
Herjavec:
What kind of stores?
Retail --
independent retailers.
Are you making these by hand?
I've made 7,500 bites
by hand.
-In your kitchen?
-Um, no.
I have a commercial kitchen.
Why isn't it selling?
Oh...
Yeah, Tania, you're the queen
of small numbers.
If I named it
"Tania's Vegan Cookies,"
I wouldn't be in front
of you today.
Yeah, you're one
of everybody.
-Right?
-Well, but...
-Good point.
It's a marketing play
is what it is.
I have a ton of
testimonials saying,
"I feel better
when I eat them.
I now have a product that I can
crave and enjoy
and not feel
guilty afterwards."
-And it's healthier. Right.
-And it's healthier.
Dates and brown rice
are extremely low
on the glycemic index,
which means it's not gonna
cause a spike
in your blood-sugar levels
and then leave you
crashing later.
Sugar is <i>the</i> worst thing
a woman
can put into her body
when she's PMS'ing.
It exacerbates
your symptoms.
-Tell us your background.
-Yeah.
What makes you an expert
at cookies?
I went into
two consulting firms
and led their marketing
departments
and branding departments
and was not passionate about
selling somebody else's dream.
This is something that
I'm passionate about,
I use for me, and I know
that women will love it.
Nobody's asked
what these cost.
So, they wholesale for $4.50
to retailers.
-For three of them.
-For three?
For three.
That's correct.
It costs me $1.55 to make,
so my margin's 66%.
That means they're getting
retailed for what?
$7?
-That's correct.
What kind of a store?
Think of juice bars --
juice bars at high-end gyms
like Equinox.
-I see.
-You have these at Equinox?
I do. I have them at all
Massachusetts Equinox.
-And are they selling through?
-Yes.
Is there a vegan truffle-like
ball that does not have sugar,
that does not have flour
and things like that in it?
I mean, do you have competition
out there?
So, my main competition
is any unhealthy product
that women crave.
Direct competitors --
There's nobody adding herbs
to the blend.
You know, there are three things
I think about
when I look at a product.
Is it something people
need and want?
Can it be made
at an affordable price?
And is there a broad
mass audience for it?
Right?
But if you're marketing it
as a PMS Bite,
you just lost half the market --
You lost children, you lost men.
I'm sorry. I'm out.
I love the marketing slogan,
and I disagree with Lori...
-Okay.
...because I think there's
so much noise out there
in this
healthy-food category.
You stand out
because you're unique.
But you're talking about
hundreds of dollars,
as Kevin says.
The numbers
are just so small.
I'm out.
I feel like you need,
um, somebody else
joined with you at your hip
to really push this thing.
I don't see you
selling this.
I don't feel that energy,
that drive.
Barbara, respectfully,
I have so much energy.
I have been pushing this
from day one.
I'll have to take you
on face value.
I hear the words,
not the music.
I am out.
Tania, I'm sorry.
You are the princess
of small numbers,
and you have to become the queen
of monster sales.
It's too small for me.
I'm out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mark, have you decided?
Cuban: Look, this is all about
social media.
Where you go
on social media
is gonna make or break
the product.
What are you doing there?
So, retail and online
is gonna be super important,
but I made the decision
to be strictly focused
on the retail side
so that I could perfect
the sales pitch,
control the sales cycle.
I think you made
a strategic mistake
in focusing specifically
on retail.
This is such
a viral product.
This is about "people talking
to each other" type product.
It's inconceivable to me that
you didn't focus online to sell,
particularly
coming into here.
And the one big upside
isn't to drive people into
Equinox gyms in Boston.
-Right.
-You know?
It's online, and so that
makes me question things.
And to do this, it would
have to be an investment,
not tuition, and it feels
more like tuition,
so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thank you.
