Hello, Sharks.
My name is Aaron Marino,
and I'm here today seeking
a $100,000 investment
for 10% equity stake
in my new company,
Pete and Pedro.
So, if I look familiar to you,
it's because
I've been here before,
but last time, I was pitching
the Alpha M style system...
-a.2, b.2!
-Oh, yeah.
...a solid idea, but at $300
a pop for a fashion formula,
Aaron, let me ask you
a question.
Mine didn't.
Let me ask you a question.
You're in a very exclusive club,
you realize this.
I am.
The number of people that get
back in the Tank is very small,
so I'd like to know, how fast
did the other one go to zero?
Uh, here's the thing.
It was, uh...
[ Laughter ]
So, I was super excited, right?
I didn't get a deal.
I was like, "No problem.
I'm still gonna be
on national TV.
I'm on 'Shark Tank,' baby,
where dreams are made."
[ Laughs ]
You know how many style systems
I sold the first day
that "Shark Tank" aired?
One.
Aaron, let's -- let's call it
what it was.
Basically,
the Sharks were right.
-It was poo-poo on a stick.
-Your idea went to zero.
-And it was -- it was...
-But great entrepreneurs
understand failure is part
of the success path.
Now you have a new deal.
Why is this one
not gonna go to zero,
is what I want to find out.
Marino: Because I'm already
ahead of the game.
This is a $1 million company
that I've built in two years.
It's making $1 million in sales
right now?
Yeah -- right at $800,000.
-What are sales this month?
-$55,000.
-Wow.
-Good for you.
-Sorry. Sorry.
-And I'm growing --
And I'm growing at 15%
per month.
How did you do that?
I am a YouTuber.
I talk about grooming, I talk
about style, I talk about hair.
How many followers
do you have?
Um, right now I'm at 600,000.
-Wow.
-Yeah.
I get 5.5 million views a month
on my Alpha M YouTube channel
and my website.
I'm a savage on social media.
Greiner:
You're hilarious.
But what is the secret sauce?
Marino:
The products themselves.
Each and every one
of my products
is a rock star
in the respective category.
You post a video,
you're gonna
talk about some grooming
element, right?
-Yeah.
-You're getting ready to go out.
You show how you put the pomade
or the putty,
and you demonstrate the product,
basically, right?
And how many videos do you post
like that?
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no.
I just want to know
if it's every day.
-Let me -- Let me go through it.
-Okay.
And don't wave your hand
down on me.
I don't like it.
Cut it out. Go ahead.
-Ooh!
-Kids! Kids!
-Come on.
-Shark fight.
Okay, so, how many views
does it get?
In the first 24 hours,
it'll get around 75,000.
I have a 9% conversion rate
when they go directly to...
-Very high.
-I don't believe it.
No, I-I get --
Okay, I get that.
-9%?
-9%.
That's unheard of.
All my numbers
are unheard of.
Not for YouTube.
Not for YouTube.
Do you get paid for those,
or you're just selling
the product?
I get paid by YouTube.
I also get paid
by these brands.
JC Penney sponsored a makeover
series that I do.
I've done a video for Chevrolet
for the new Corvette.
Um, I'm talking to
a few other big brands now.
I mean, I've promoted everything
from underwear
to Bombas socks --
Remember them?
I am approached
by everybody.
How much money do you get
out of that?
I'm just wondering
how much comes
from you being paid
as a great salesman...
Yeah.
...and how much is from
the actual product sale.
Two separate -- I've got
two different businesses.
How much did you bring in --
just out of curiosity...
From the other business?
As talent -- As talent
as an "endorser."
Uh, from my Alpha M,
I did $600,000 last year.
-Wow.
-Wow.
So, is that part of the deal
you're offering us?
-So, how do you split your time?
-No, it's not.
-And here's why, Barbara.
-That's the problem.
Marino:
I'll tell you why.
No, it's not,
but let me tell you why.
-It's a big problem.
-I have no -- No, it's not,
because what I have
is credibility,
and the moment that I have
somebody else's money
on the line
basically determines --
Cuban: It's not that
this is a bad product,
but it's you selling it.
The real product is you.
This just happens to be what
you're selling right now.
Aaron, there's no other way
to do it,
because how do you allocate
your time?
If I give you $100,000
for 10%...
Mm-hmm.
...of the, uh,
the donkey deal...
[ Greiner laughs ]
...why would I want you spending
any time doing anything else?
Because it's the way that social
media and influencers work.
Here's the thing.
This is my full-time job,
but another part of this
is me creating content,
engaging with people.
Why would I want one
of my entrepreneurs
spending any time doing anything
else except making me rich?
Why would I do that?
It's a byproduct of me
doing what I do.
-No, it isn't.
-Sure it is.
Put them together --
You put them together,
and then every dime you
bring in, I get 10% of it.
That's how it should work.
You're working for <i>me</i>
to make money.
-How appetizing.
-That's what I want.
-I bet you can't wait.
-Yeah. That sounds great,
but let me...
-[ Laughs ]
...just for a second --
Here's how we're gonna
scale this.
I'm an influencer.
-I don't care.
Well, you should care, because
it's worth millions of dollars!
If I give you money,
I'm your investor.
You think I want you
doing anything else
for anybody else,
if I give you money?
Cuban: So, if you decide
to build this
to be the next
Paul Mitchell, right,
you're gonna be the face,
you're gonna be doing
everything,
and you're gonna
be promoting,
but they've got to be
the same thing.
They go hand in hand.
I understand that.
I appreciate that.
-All right, Aaron.
I'm willing to make you
an offer, okay?
So let's just --
This is my first offer
in the Tank!
-Well, there you go.
-There you go.
You might regret it.
-Here's the deal --
Alpha M merges with mini donkey,
all right?
The two of them
come together.
-Okay.
-Because I want you full time.
I give you the $100,000
for 20%,
and I help you
as much as I can,
drive as much traffic
as I can,
'cause that's actually
how it works.
That's the deal.
What do you say to my offer?
Narrator: Kevin O'Leary has
offered Aaron $100,000 for 20%,
but he wants Aaron to combine
his Pete and Pedro
hair product company
and his lucrative
social-media business, Alpha M.
What do you say to my offer?
I say that it's, uh --
it's -- it's -- it's a haircut.
[ Chuckles ]
I think you're a great
personality,
and I can see why you do so well
on YouTube.
For me, I don't -- I don't get
why this is fantastic.
For me, I don't think this is
the right product, so I'm out.
I understand.
Thank you.
What you've proven since
you were here last time
is that you can drive traffic.
What you happen to be driving
traffic to is this product,
and people are buying it.
But there's other products.
Like, if I invest
in this product
and you come out
with a hairbrush...
-Then there's another --
-...just as an example.
Yeah.
Is that part of
the mini donkey,
or is that part
of Alpha M?
Like, whi-which one?
And if your loyalty
is split,
you're gonna go to where
you make the greatest
amount of profit.
It's all got
to be one thing.
-It's one business.
-So make me an offer, Robert.
I'm here to make a deal,
because I need help, honestly.
Well, you got to combine
the two.
Okay.
You're the product,
and the thing you're peddling
is enthusiasm and confidence,
and there's nothing
more magnetic
in any business field
than that quality,
and you've got it.
I don't think you need
any of our help, frankly,
on building your following,
doing social media.
But what you don't know is what
I know inside and out
for building a business
for 30 years.
I know structure,
organization,
when to hire who,
who to fire.
I know all that,
'cause I've made every damn
mistake out there.
I'll offer you $100,000 for 10%
of your Alpha M
social media business.
That's it.
-Why, Aaron?
-It's too much,
and I don't feel you bring
the value that I need.
Aaron, sorry,
do you have a counter?
-Do you have a counter
for the amount of money?
-I wouldn't do it for less.
[ Laughs ] Um...
10% of everything --
Ooh, God.
Um...$300,000 for -- for 10%.
Corcoran:
Yeah, I'll tell you what --
I'll give you half the money
if you get somebody else
in the deal.
Mark, do it.
Bring on the social-media help.
Yeah, but I'm -- there's just
not enough there for me, Aaron.
Okay.
I just think I bring
too much value,
but I think any of these guys
would be great,
but I'm out.
Okay.
You're always gonna be the face
of the brand.
I'm interested in using
your platform
to move other products.
So, how about this?
I'll give you $100,000 for 10%
of any products.
Today, starting with
the little donkey.
Tomorrow, there will be
a sweater, a pocket square.
There will be other products.
As people pay you for promotion,
you -- you keep that money,
but I see you as a platform
to sell other products
that men struggle with.
-Here's where that gets
complicated.
-Doesn't work.
Is because I need
my authenticity
and I still have the ability
to say "no."
If you're my partner
and you're saying, "Hey..."
-You still --
"...here's the next product,"
and I've got to partner
with you.
-Aaron -- No, no, no, no.
Hang on. Aaron --
-You've got to combine it.
-You can't -- You can't sell --
-Barbara -- Hold on.
Barbara, that 10% of Alpha M,
$100,000 -- You good?
-Yes.
Aaron...
-Yes.
-Let's do it.
-[ Laughs ]
-You're a smart guy.
You've got great judgment,
you're good-looking.
Hey, come on!
And we're gonna have
kids together.
-[ Laughs ]
-[ Laughs ]
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.
-That's awesome. Mm!
-Thank you. My pleasure.
