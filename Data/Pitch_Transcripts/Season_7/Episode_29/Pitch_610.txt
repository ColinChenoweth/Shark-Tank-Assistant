I'll give you the same offer
as Kevin.
Narrator: ...and fight
each other for a deal.
How could you guys
be so gullible?
Mark, can I just
listen to him?
You can't be that stupid,
Robert.
The entrepreneurs must get
the full amount
they're asking for, or they'll
walk away with nothing.
I'm definitely
bootstrapping.
You are such a con artist.
And tonight it gets bloodier
than ever in the Tank.
You're working for <i>me</i>
to make money.
-I can't work with you.
-Why not?
-Uh...
-It's the person.
It's the person.
Get the [bleep] out of here.
Oh!
Narrator:
Who are the Sharks?
They're self-made
business experts worth billions.
Kevin O'Leary is
a shrewd venture capitalist
who made his fortune
selling a children's
educational company
for over $4 billion.
Barbara Corcoran went from
waiting tables in Manhattan
to building the city's premier
$2 billion real-estate empire.
Robert Herjavec, son of
an immigrant factory worker,
founded one of
the world's preeminent
cyber-security firms.
Lori Greiner, the Queen of QVC,
holds over 100 patents
and has launched
more than 400 products,
grossing over a half a billion
dollars in sales.
And Mark Cuban,
esteemed billionaire tech mogul
and the outspoken owner
of the Dallas Mavericks.
First up is an entrepreneur
from Season 4
returning to the Tank with a new
opportunity for the Sharks.
customers just didn't bite...
-Shocking.
-...and neither did you.
Thank God.
But you gave me something
more valuable --
a new direction
and life-changing advice.
You see, I knew you were right.
I needed a lower-price-point
product,
something that every guy needed
and used.
Well, about a month after
I was on "Shark Tank,"
there I am styling my hair
when inspiration struck,
and Pete and Pedro was born --
a new line of super-awesome
men's hairstyling products.
Pete and Pedro
equals bueno hair.
We're selling direct
to the consumer,
which means a higher-quality
product at a great price.
Guys buy it, they try it,
they love it,
and sign up
for the Bueno Hair Club,
where we automatically ship them
their favorite
Pete and Pedro product
every four, six, or eight weeks.
Look, Sharks, I'm back,
this time with a product
that men need and love,
and I'm not walking out of here
again without a deal,
so who's ready to partner
with me and share the hair?
[ Laughter ]
All right. So, I've got
some samples for you guys.
Cuban: Notice there's
only four, Kevin.
[ Laughter ]
I have six different
styling aids
and a shampoo and conditioner.
Smells delicious --
like lime and lemon.
Yeah, it's actually like
a freshly bathed tiger.
Yours did?
-You're not her customer.
-But you cut your market
in half.
Greiner: Well, let me
ask you a question.
Couldn't you take and make these
for everybody...
Absolutely.
...call them something else,
but on your website,
you could put "This is great
for women with PMS"?
My name is Tomer Alpert,
and I'm from Telluride,
Colorado.
I live here with
my wife, Gracie,
and our new baby boy, Leo.
It's very realistic.
As people get more dependent
on their devices,
they still crave a personal way
to connect with each other.
Our product blends convenience
with thoughtfulness,
allowing people to share
the way they feel
with the people
they care about most.
How you doing, buddy?
I haven't brought a paycheck
home in four years.
My wife and I have both been
working on it full time,
and we're literally out of cash.
When I think about my family
and the business,
I almost can't believe
what I'm doing.
So much is at risk -- not only my future,
but their future, as well.
It's now about my son
and his ability to have college
and a future.
It feels like the most
enormous pressure
I've ever been under in my life.
Frank Frank, let's go!
Having a Shark on board would
validate every decision
I've ever made for the business.
It would give us the cash I need
to pay rent and to keep
the business afloat.
[ Smooching ]
My family's put so much faith
in me, I can't let them down.
I hope a Shark will join me
and help spread the love.
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Tomer Alpert.
I'm from Telluride, Colorado,
and I'm seeking $200,000
for 6% of our company, Felt.
Think about how wonderful
it feels
to receive a handwritten card
in the mail,
knowing that your friend
picked the card just for you.
And they took time
to handwrite you
a personal, thoughtful message.
-Hm.
-Great experience, right?
Now think about sending the
card -- terrible experience.
You have to drive to the store,
pick a card from a giant wall,
drive home, write your message,
search for stamps,
and still have to trek out
to the mailbox.
So it's no wonder we don't send
more handwritten cards.
That's why we built Felt.
Now you can send an authentic,
handwritten card
from your phone or tablet
anywhere, anytime.
Here's how it works.
Simply download Felt
from the app store,
pick the card for your occasion,
then handwrite your message
right on the screen.
You can use your finger
or a stylus.
Address the envelope,
and <i>we</i> print, seal, stamp,
and mail the card for you.
It is that simple.
-Pretty cool.
-Thank you.
Now, we're not only making
card-sending simpler.
We also make it better,
because with Felt,
you can add up to three photos
to your card,
and you can even add a short
handwritten message
to each of them.
And we built Felt
'cause we want everyone
to be able to be the heartfelt,
thoughtful person
they really are.
So join us, Sharks, and let's
spread love around the world.
I'd love to give you each
a handwritten card
I wrote you using Felt.
Would this be exactly
how I would get it?
-Exactly how you'd get it.
-Hm.
Do you have some photos in there
we can see, too?
-Thank you, Tomer.
-I do.
So, everybody's gonna get
a different card.
-Thank you, Tomer.
-Thank you.
Each card will be a sample of
what you can do from the app.
-Thanks, Tomer.
-You're welcome. Thank you.
Ohhh.
-Which one did you get?
-I got the bulldog.
That's one of our
best-selling cards.
So, Felt is actually
a marketplace
for designers
to sell their cards,
which is a big part
of our strategic plan.
Oh.
That's interesting.
Tomer,
can I upload my own JPEG?
-Yes.
-And does it stay in my account?
Am I building an account
for myself?
-Yes.
All of your sentimental mail
you send, we at Felt --
your handwritten card,
your photos --
get saved in the app...
-Yep.
...and you can come back
to them and see them.
You can also resend them and edit them
and change people's names.
I've got, uh,
an engagement party,
and I've got 88 people coming.
Can I build an invitation
and then load in the addresses
and then do a mass mailing?
So, we don't do
invitations yet,
but that's where
we're heading,
because what you can do in Felt
is you can save every single
address you write.
So, let's say you're a bride.
-Yeah.
Brides do 75 thank-you cards,
on average,
and they handwrite
every address.
Now in Felt,
you get saved addresses,
so when you want
to do invitations
or holiday cards next year,
all your addresses
are handwritten.
How long have you been
in the app store?
Since May 2013.
And how many downloads?
Over 60,000, and we have
a 4.5-star rating
across both of our apps.
60,000 is nothing,
so that's why you're here.
Right? That's not enough to
build and sustain a business.
And here's why.
So we started selling
a $4 greeting card,
and we're scrappy
entrepreneurs.
We invested all of our own cash
into this.
So I've put in $100,000.
And who's the "we" in this,
Tomer?
There's four partners.
Me, my wife, Gracie --
she does operations.
The reason we're here today
is 'cause we've identified
two huge markets
who have huge problems --
brides and professionals.
A bride already
has the problem.
She or he has to has to send
75 thank-you cards.
So what we want to do is plug in
with registries.
Imagine if you go to Macy's
and you build your registry
and you learn about Felt.
And you're like, "Holy moly."
I-I see what you're doing,
but that's just a one-off, right?
No, no. A bride turns into
a holiday card,
so next year,
she does holiday cards...
Eh...
...and she does the birthday
cards and she does --
I'm just telling you,
because my wife would be,
"Are you kidding me?
You're not willing
to take the time
to really
handwrite them?"
The best tool for women --
guilt.
Yeah.
It's totally authentic --
as if you wrote it
with pen and paper
on your dining-room table.
-Tomer, there's a lot --
-And that's what customers
love about us.
Tomer, isn't there a lot of
people that do this already?
There's nobody else
that lets you
literally handwrite
on the screen.
Everybody else does some sort
of mimicking.
I love to send handwritten cards
as a thank-you.
It's very personal.
I've never gotten a handwritten
thank-you from you, ever.
Well, you've never done
anything that deserved
a thank-you, Barbara.
That's true.
You're right about that.
[ Laughter ]
There's a lot of people
doing this.
There's nothing proprietary
about the technology.
I'm out.
I understand.
Do you know what your
customer-acquisition
cost is now?
-So, for consumers, it's $8.
-Ohh.
And that's why we're focusing
on brides...
Corcoran: Yeah.
...because brides will spend
$210 with us...
-Yeah.
-...and we net $125.
-But you don't have them yet.
-Yes.
I've got four companies
in the wedding business.
You know, I own Honeyfunds.
We have all your
customers already.
-There you go.
-This is a good app for them.
In the marriage space
you want to pursue,
I've got them for zero
customer-acquisition cost,
but I want more than 6%.
-[ Laughs ]
-What are you willing to sell?
How much equity are you
willing to sell?
6% doesn't get me up
in the morning.
What would you like to buy?
How much do you need --
How much do you need
to make a deal?
I got to have a minimum --
I got to have a minimum of 10%.
I'll give you $225,000
for 10%...
...and all the brides
you can eat.
You're crazy to say no
to that.
-[ Laughs ]
-Yeah. That's...
I'm giving you
free customers.
I'm gonna make it easier --
I'm out.
Thanks, Mark.
I appreciate your time.
I'm gonna make it easier,
because I'm going out,
but I think you should take
an offer from this guy.
-Thank you, Barbara.
-Yeah, I got to have 10%.
I'll give you $225,000 --
And I'll make it easy
for you, too.
I'm out, but I think what
Kevin's offered you here
might bring you just
what you said you wanted,
which was brides.
Thank you very much, Lori.
Tomer, seven seasons,
I've never seen him make
this good an offer.
Seriously.
Congratulations, Tomer.
-[ Howls ]
-Wow.
-Congratulations!
-Good job.
Congrats, buddy.
I didn't think Kevin was the
Shark that we were gonna get.
Whaaaat?
I need to go have a cerveza.
I need to go hug my wife!
I can't wait to see her.
[ Voice breaking ] Um...
this has just been a long road.
[ Chuckles ] Thank you.
It was amazing.
Like, he just --
[ Crying and laughing ]
[ Laughs ]
I'm so happy.
I can't believe it.
[ Laughs ]
