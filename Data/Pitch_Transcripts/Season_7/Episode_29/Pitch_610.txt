Hi, Sharks.
My name is Maneesh Sethi,
and I'm from Boston,
Massachusetts,
and I'm seeking $500,000
in exchange for 3.14%
of my company.
-3.14.
-It's Pi Day!
[ Light laughter ]
Sharks, everybody
has bad habits,
and for some of us,
they're minor --
nail biting,
hitting the snooze button.
But for others, they can be much
more serious or even deadly.
Meet Pavlok, the first wearable
that doesn't just track
what you do,
but actually changes
what you do.
Pavlok helps you become aware
by alerting you
when you do behaviors
you'd like to reduce,
then simply press the button
and Pavlok releases
a mild electric sensation...
that helps you reduce
cravings --
[ Laughter ]
You can laugh, but it's actually
something very serious.
I <i>am</i> laughing.
Maneesh: It releases
a mild electric sensation
that helps you reduce cravings
and actually breaks bad habits
in the brain.
Pavlok harnesses
scientific methods
that have been researched
for decades,
but it's not just research.
Since launch, our users have had
incredible success
in changing their behaviors.
Now, Sharks, which of you wants
to join us in our mission
to help people across the globe
take control
of their own behavior?
How did you come up
with this idea?
I've always had severe ADD.
I could never get myself
to actually get stuff done.
I couldn't get myself to commit
to anything,
so I did what any normal person
would do --
I hired someone to sit down
next to me
and slap me in the face every
time I went on Facebook.
-Nice.
-[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
And I wrote a blog post
about it.
-Why not?
-Seriously?
[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
It's a cool video.
And the blog post
went insanely viral.
-Did they actually slap you?
-Yeah.
There's a video of me
getting slapped.
But did you get
the work done?
I did. Yeah.
It was really cool.
That made you come up
with this idea.
Yeah. I was visiting
a friend of mine.
I'm like, "Dude,
why am I paying?
I could just make a --
make a zapper
that zaps me every time
I go on Facebook.
-Can we try it?
-This is fascinating.
Can we try it?
I'm gonna show it to you
after one moment.
I just want to explain kind of
the science behind it,
and then I'll bring it out
for you.
Pavlok uses a type of science
called aversive conditioning.
It was very common in the 1960s.
It's a slight electric stimulus
that's done while doing
a undesired bad habit,
and it very rapidly trains
your reptile brain
to associate that uncomfortable
stimulus with the bad habit.
Herjavec: This is based
on the Pavlovian principle.
Can you explain that principle
to us?
Sure. So, when you add
two stimuli together
at the same time,
your brain doesn't know
what is causing the stimuli
to occur.
It just knows that they're both
happening at the same time,
and it starts to retreat.
So I'll go ahead
and bring it out for you
right now to try on.
Here you go,
Mr. Herjavec.
-This one?
-Yeah.
Please put it on for me.
It's got your name engraved
on it and everything.
Greiner: Wow.
I like the design of it.
-Thank you, Manny.
-Thank you.
And if you notice...
Mr. Cuban.
-Thank you, sir.
Simply press the lightning bolt
on the top of it.
Press down hard.
-Oh, there you go.
-It's just a little pulse.
Yeah. So,
I set it low for you,
because I didn't want everybody
to get scared.
Can you set it higher?
Yeah. I'll do it right now.
All right.
-Oh!
-Ow! [Bleep]
Turn it back now.
Ow! Wow!
How do you turn it off?
-I barely feel it!
Well, let me come back
to our results, okay?
Okay.
In a study that we based
our first experiment with,
it was an aversive conditioning
study that was done in 1988
with 832 subjects.
So, okay. So wait, so wait.
Let's -- Let's qualify that.
After five days...
You said, "We based our
first study on," right?
Suggesting that...
-In 1988.
...that you did the study,
right? Did you...
So, I'll tell you about a study
we did right after,
but you can actually look
through our evidence pamphlet,
where we have
21 clinical trials.
Herjavec:
I bite my nails.
I'm trying to not bite my nails
all the time.
Where it falls down
for me is
if I have the discipline
to buzz myself,
do I not have the discipline
to stop?
People -- Okay.
People -- Do you have
the discipline to stop?
-Well, I don't, but --
-Do you wish you could stop?
-I do --
-So, can I -- So, here's...
-But your premise is --
-Sorry.
It's all nonsense,
Robert.
It's all nonsense
across the board.
Herjavec: Just --
I-I-I can't get around that.
Like, I'm just --
I want to bite my nails,
and for me to stop,
I have to hit this thing.
Sure.
Why can't Lori
buzz it for me?
She can.
Um, she absolutely can.
There's a remote control --
There's a remote-control app.
There's automation.
What percentage of the time
does it not work?
It doesn't work if you don't
want it to work.
So, it doesn't --
-Oh!
Wow!
-Yeah, of course.
So, if you use it on sugar,
after about three or four days
on, like, a cookie
or tortilla chips,
you'll start to notice
the flavor changes.
Now, what's interesting
about it, in the first --
You start to notice
the flavor changes?
-Yeah, you do.
-You're such a con artist.
I'm absolutely not.
As for results, Mark,
more than 50% of our users
break their habit in five day--
in seven days or less.
First of all, you can't -- First
of all -- Okay, let me just --
Let's leave the skepticism
for one minute.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-I just want you to --
I love the skepticism,
'cause he doesn't know
what's about to come.
Because it's all nonsense,
because you can't tell
anything in five days.
You guys can argue
till the cows come home.
You want to get a deal,
explain to me why you're
worth $14 million.
-Sure $15 million.
-What is it? How much?
Well, number one -- number one,
our sales are great.
-What are your sales?!
-What are your sales?
You didn't even
get to that.
So, we're in pre-order,
and we actually just began
shipping this week.
We've sold $800,000 of revenue.
Wait, wait -- preorders.
3/4 of the users
were preorders,
and 1/4 of the users
were prototypes.
What did each of those people
pay for one device?
$200.
How much?
$200.
Who buys these?
So, our biggest users
are sitting too long,
waking up on time,
nail biting, and eating.
So we've started to build out
multiple really cool
integrations for this product.
The first thing
is the alarm clock.
It's the first alarm clock
that works.
When you get a slight zap
in the morning,
it actually knocks you awake
with a jolt of adrenaline.
-Great way to start the day.
-[ Laughs ]
Yeah. You'd be surprised.
The people love it.
Can't wait.
How could you guys
be so gullible?
-Read the evidence
if you're that --
-We're not being gullible.
None of it's
<i>your</i> evidence!
We're asking questions.
No one's disputing
aversion therapy.
-Yeah. So, we're --
-Aversion therapy works.
We're bringing aversion therapy
to consumers!
You're using other
people's studies...
But, so, there's nothing
that's actually happening...
Mark, we know you're the
smartest guy in the room...
...besides the...
It's not about being the
smartest guy in the room!
You can't be that stupid,
Robert,
to even think there's
any legitimacy.
-Enough. Calm down.
-Can I just listen to him?
Geez.
Ugh. Gosh, you guys
are making me so ADD.
All right,
let me talk about the...
Oh, <i>we</i> make you ADD?
Maneesh: You guys make it
happen. All right.
Maneesh,
you're a strange dude.
-[ Laughs ]
-Yeah.
Some of the cool stuff
we're doing that Mr. Cuban
would like is this --
We've started integrating
with --
I don't think Mark's
gonna like anything.
Herjavec: Yeah.
Aversion therapy is legit,
but what's not legit
is trying to take credit
for other studies and apply it
to your product.
You're kidding.
I gave you an evidence booklet
with all
the citations, sir.
Greiner:
These are your studies?
You've got a booklet
that has -- None of those
studies are yours!
They're just related
to aversion therapy.
No, no, no, no.
These are studies we -- we --
These are
aversion therapy studies.
Aversion therapy studies,
so -- Okay.
Outside your realm.
Not necessarily --
Oh, well, you know what?
That's -- That's the strongest
point here...
O'Leary:
Hang on. Mark...
...is that this isn't based on
anything that you've done.
-Right!
-Are you negotiating, or --
Okay, so we have had
600 users.
So, where are <i>your</i> studies?
Over half of them quit their
addiction in five days --
seven days or less.
Well, wait. But you don't
have any proof that it
changes your taste buds.
Yes, we do. We do.
We have users. We have evidence.
You don't have any testing.
More than half of
our users quit --
More than 81% of our users quit
nail biting in four days.
Where is your proof of this?
What study do you have?
You should be doing
clinical trials.
-Sure. I'd love to.
-Right?
-They're expensive.
-So, we began --
Why don't you have
clinical trials?
All right,
I'm gonna make it simple.
I talk about things.
I say things are either heroes
or zeroes.
For me, this is
a nowhere-near-o.
I'm out.
I find your presentation is
exhausting and complicated,
and I couldn't imagine having
the energy to deal with that.
This doesn't sound
very positive, Barbara.
I'm out.
Okay, Lori and Barbara
are history.
I'd like to talk a little bit
about our numbers this year.
Let me --
Let me just finish.
Sure.
When you first came out,
I really liked it.
It's habit.
Habit creates discipline,
discipline creates more habit,
and that's how you get success.
What I don't like about is you
have a $16 million valuation
on preorders --
It's too much.
I'm out.
So, I understand
absolutely, Robert.
Thank you very much.
Look, if you had
verifiable proof
that all your
aversion therapy...
Mm-hmm.
...can be well-executed
with your device,
you wouldn't need to import
other people's studies,
because with all this
advance money you got,
you could've gone to any
university and said,
"You know what?
We don't want to rush it.
We want to get our own
verifiable studies in place
so that no one
can question us."
The one thing that kills
tech products is hyperbole...
Mm-hmm.
...because at some point
you have to execute.
You violated that one.
-Let me speak. Listen.
Now your turn to listen.
If you would've just said,
"You know what?
This is a reminder,
and everybody is different,
so we have different ways
to remind you."
Bam.
Right? But you went so
over-the-top with nonsense,
it is everything but
a legitimate product,
and for those reasons,
I'm out.
Let me tell you --
Let me come back to medical,
'cause I really want to answer
Lori's question.
Maneesh, all of these
Sharks are out.
They're all out.
-Kevin's left.
They're all out, okay?
There is a medical component
to this, but I --
Shock yourself
for a minute.
You're a combination of
spontaneous combustion
and ADD mixed together.
-[ Laughs ]
-I'm not kidding.
It's very difficult
to listen to you.
-Yeah.
Luckily for you, I got
my undergrad in psychology.
To make money, I worked
on a rhesus study
that used the same technology
as you to modify behavior.
-[ Laughs ]
-How many other degrees, right?
And I'm telling you
the truth here.
So I'm interested, okay?
Whoa.
in Maneesh's habit-breaking
watch, Pavlok.
I believe this technology works
'cause I've seen it work.
Your valuation is crazy.
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.
It's not worth
$15.9 million now.
I'm gonna solve the problem
in the deal structure.
I'm very creative.
I'll give you the $500,000
as debt on the company, okay?
You're gonna give me the 3.14%
as equity today,
and you're gonna walk out of
here with a Shark Tank deal.
I'm gonna put it on
for 24 months at 7.5%
and balloon payment me back
in two years.
If 1/3 of your projections are
right, you can easily do that.
-It's an offer!
-It's an offer.
This is the problem.
Um, damn.
-There's a problem?
-There's no problem.
See, the problem,
Mr. Wonderful,
is that we're not focused
on the money.
We're focused more on the habits
we're changing.
Not focused on the money?
You've come to the wrong place,
my friend.
Cuban:
You're focused more on the what?
-I'm here to make money.
-Let him finish, Kev.
Maneesh: Our biggest thing --
Our biggest goal
is to break bad habits
around the world,
and, Mr. Wonderful, I just --
I can't work with you.
Why not?
I'm just worried that if
we work together --
He doesn't --
You don't like him.
I do like him as a person,
but I feel like, as an investor
in the company,
it would be really bad.
Greiner:
Maneesh, you didn't want
an offer here today.
Did you really?
-I absolutely want an offer.
I absolutely want an offer.
-You just came in for exposure?
Okay, you got one, and why don't
you want the structure of
that offer? Why not?
It's the [sighs] The structure's
actually quite good.
Uh...
-It's the person.
It's the person.
I feel like...
Maneesh, you're an [bleep]
Get the [bleep] out of here.
Oh!
Maneesh: Um, okay.
Well...if you --
Are you all out?
[Bleep] you.
We're all out.
Cuban: Done, Maneesh.
See ya.
All right, Sharks.
Thank you very much.
Wouldn't want to be ya.
