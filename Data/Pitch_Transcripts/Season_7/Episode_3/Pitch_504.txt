WHAT IS FOOT CARDIGAN?
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
FOOT CARDIGAN

SOCK-SUBSCRIPTION COMPANY
IN ALL THE LAND.
WE DESIGN AWESOME SOCKS
FOR MEN, WOMEN, AND KIDS
AND DELIVER THEM
ALL OVER THE WORLD EVERY MONTH.
WE TAKE THE OTHERWISE
SNOOZE OF AN ERRAND
OF GOING TO THE STORE
TO BUY SOCKS
AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING
NOT ONLY SUPER FUN,
BUT SUPER CONVENIENT,
AS WELL.
OUR SOCK FAIRY
CAREFULLY SELECTS
A RANDOM PAIR OF SOCKS
TO MAGICALLY APPEAR
IN OUR CUSTOMERS' MAILBOXES
EVERY MONTH.
SO THEY NEVER KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA GET.
BASICALLY, WE'RE SPREADING CHEER
