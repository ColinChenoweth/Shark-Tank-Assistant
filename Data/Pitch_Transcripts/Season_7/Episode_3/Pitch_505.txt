MY NAME'S WAYNE JOHNSON,
AND I'M AN AWARD-WINNING
WEB DESIGNER
FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.,
SEEKING $300,000 FOR 20% EQUITY
IN MY COMPANY ValPark MOBILE.
ValPark MOBILE IS AN APP
THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS
TO PAY FOR VALET
AND GARAGE PARKING
SUPER EASY, FAST, AND SECURE
ALL FROM THEIR SMARTPHONE.
HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU GONE
TO VALET AND REALIZED
Johnson: HE WAS LOOKING
FOR A SOLUTION LIKE THIS
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TAKE
CREDIT CARDS.
HOW MANY PEOPLE CARRY AROUND
MORE THAN $25 AT ONCE
IN THEIR POCKET ANYMORE?
NO, YOU'RE SOLVING A PROBLEM.
THERE'S NO QUESTION.
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW BIG CAN YOU GET?
HE'S SAYING
HOW SCALABLE IS IT?
YEAH, BECAUSE THERE'S
ONE OF THOSE IN EVERY MARKET --
THE GUY WHO DOMINATES
VALET PARKING.
YOU NEED TO GET TO YOUR PARTNER
IN EVERY CITY.
IF I WENT AND LOOKED
AT SAN FRANCISCO,
I'D FIND ONE GUY HAS 60%
OF ALL THE VALET COMPANIES
AND THE OTHERS
ARE ALL SPLIT UP.
YOU NEED THE 60% GUY
IN EVERY MARKET.
-HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?
-THAT'S THE PLAN.
LAST YEAR, WE STARTED
WITH BETA IN 33 LOCATIONS.
NOW WE'RE AT OVER 115.
SO WHAT'S YOUR SALES?
LAST YEAR, WE DID $270,000.
HOW MANY YEARS DID YOU SAY
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT?
WE STARTED IT LAST YEAR.
WE WENT LIVE LAST YEAR.
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
DO YOU TAKE?
SO, FIRST YEAR --
THIS IS HOW WE MAKE OUR MONEY.
WE ADDED AN 8.5% CONVENIENCE FEE
TO WHATEVER THE PRINCIPAL WAS.
8.5% TO THE CONSUMER?
THAT'S PASSED DOWN
TO THE CONSUMER.
AND THIS IS WHY VENDORS
LOVE US --
Johnson:
WE'RE NOT STOPPING.
