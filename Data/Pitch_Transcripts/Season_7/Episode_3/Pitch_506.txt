ONE PAIR OF SOCKS
AT A TIME.
SO, SHARKS, I HOPE YOU'RE READY
TO STEP UP YOUR SOCK GAME.
WHICH IS A CRAZY
COINCIDENCE
BECAUSE I HAVE MAILBOXES
RIGHT HERE
WITH EACH OF YOUR NAMES
ON THEM.
LET'S SEE WHAT THE SOCK FAIRY
BROUGHT YOU.
YOUR COST OF GOODS,
LIFETIME VALUE, ATTRITION RATE.
-GIVE IT TO US.
-AND REMEMBER ALL THAT.
SO, OUR COST PER SOCK
IS $1.32 A PAIR.
THAT'S LANDED OR DELIVERED
TO THE CUSTOMER?
THAT'S LANDED.
SO THAT YOU AGGREGATE --
AND YOU'RE MAKING THEM
OVERSEAS?
AT THAT ONE GIVEN TIME.
AND THEN DROP OFF.
WE HAVE THE EBB AND FLOW
LIKE A CLASSIC RETAILER.
WHO IS YOUR BIGGEST
CUSTOMER?
DEFINITELY MEN.
I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT ON TREND,
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?
MEN ARE REALLY
INTO THESE CRAZY SOCKS.
EVEN MARK IS WEARING THEM,
RIGHT?
I'VE GOT LIKE
500 DIFFERENT ONES, YEAH.
WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR SALE
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?
ABOUT $900,000
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
-$900,000?
-GOOD FOR YOU.
-THAT'S A LOT OF SOCKS.
-THAT IS A LOT OF SOCKS.
ARE YOU GUYS TAKING
A SALARY?
SO, WE'RE GONNA DO $1.5 MILLION
THIS YEAR.
WHAT ARE YOUR BACKGROUNDS?
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING,
YOU HAVE A TECH BACKGROUND
OR AN S.E.O. BACKGROUND.
YEAH, SO, MY BACKGROUND'S
IN CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION.
OKAY.
I WORKED AT A MARKETING AGENCY
IN DALLAS,
AND JUST LOVED
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF,
WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING
ON THE WEBSITE?
GETTING THEM TO BUY,
AND WHAT PUSHES THEM TO BUY.
SO, WE HAVE ALMOST
A 7% CONVERSION RATE
ON FOOT CARDIGAN
RIGHT NOW.
THEN WHY AREN'T
YOUR NUMBERS HIGHER?
IF YOU HAVE THAT BIG
A CONVERSION RATE
AND YOU HAVE THOSE MARGINS,
YOU SHOULD BE JUST PLOWING IN.
SO, WE JUST CAME FULL-TIME.
FOR THE FIRST 2 1/2 YEARS,
WE DID THIS ALL ON THE SIDE
BETWEEN --
THERE'S FOUR CO-FOUNDERS.
WE HAVE EIGHT KIDS.
WE WERE WORKING FULL-TIME JOBS,
GETTING THIS THING GOING.
WHY ARE YOU NOT MAKING
DOMESTICALLY?
'CAUSE YOU CAN TURN THIS
FAIRLY QUICKLY DOMESTICALLY.
IT'LL SAVE YOU
FROM AN INVENTORY POSITION.
NUMBER ONE,
IT WAS PRICE.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I INVESTED
IN A COMPANY CALLED BAMBAS.
-RIGHT.
-RIGHT.
AND THESE GUYS ARE, LIKE,
ON FIRE.
AND THEIR DOMESTIC CHALLENGE
IS THAT THEY CAN'T FIND
A CERTAIN MACHINE
THAT IS SEAMLESS IN THE SOCK.
BUT THIS SOCK IS READILY
AVAILABLE TO THE MARKET.
IT'S A QUALITY SOCK.
I LIKE THIS.
-THANK YOU.
-SO ARE YOU OPEN TO DOMESTIC?
-ABSOLUTELY.
-OF COURSE.
WHO ARE YOUR COMPETITORS
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW?
WELL, WE HAVE
A LOT OF COMPETITORS.
BECAUSE THE MARGINS
ARE SO HIGH.
EVERYBODY WANTS SOCKS --
WANTS TO SELL SOCKS.
SURE, BUT I THINK
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT.
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONE OF THE
FEW SOCK-SUBSCRIPTION COMPANIES
THAT MANUFACTURE
AND MAKE OUR OWN.
SO I THINK WE'RE DOING
QUITE A BIT BETTER
THAN MOST OF OUR COMPETITION.
MEANING THEY'RE GOING
TO THIRD PARTIES
AND WHOLESALING THEM
FROM THEM,
AND SO WE KNOW OUR MARGINS
ARE MUCH BETTER.
SO, NOW, WHAT IF I --
I GET A PAIR OF SOCKS.
WE GET FEEDBACK ALL THE TIME
FROM PEOPLE SAYING,
"I CANNOT WAIT
UNTIL I OPEN MY MAILBOX
AND THOSE FOOT CARDIGAN
SOCKS ARE THERE."
JUST OUT OF INTEREST,
IF I GIVE YOU $250,000 FOR 10%,
HOW DO I EVER GET
MY MONEY BACK?
WE THINK, HONESTLY,
WITH THIS VALUATION
AND THE $250,000,
WE BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD
GET IT BACK IN THREE YEARS.
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IT'LL TAKE THREE YEARS
TO GET US BACK $250,000?
THAT'S QUITE SOME TIME.
I TAKE IT OUT THE SAME TIME
YOU GUYS DO.
IN THE LONG RUN, THAT'S WHY
YOU INVEST IN A BUSINESS.
RIGHT. MAKES SENSE.
NO, THANKS FOR THAT OFFER.
THAT'S AWESOME.
Carter: IF YOU'RE GONNA VALUE
THIS AS A TECH COMPANY
AND EVENTUALLY RAISE
VENTURE CAPITAL,
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO JUSTIFY TO INVESTORS
THAT YOU'RE GIVEN DISTRIBUTIONS
TO A PREVIOUS TIER OF INVESTORS.
AT MY COMPANY ATOM FACTORY,
WE PROBABLY INVESTED IN OVER
ABOUT 65 TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
ALSO CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS,
IN ADDITION TO STANCE SOCKS,
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
IS A ROCKET SHIP RIGHT NOW.
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU GUYS
IS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING
AFTER THIS
SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS,
WHICH I THINK THERE'S
A HUGE MARKET THERE.
SO WHAT I'M GONNA OFFER
IS 250K FOR 15%.
NO DISTRIBUTIONS.
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
YOUR BRAND IS GONNA NEED
IS A NARRATIVE.
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
YOUR BRAND DEFENSIBLE,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CREATE
SOME SORT OF CONNECTION
WITH THE CONSUMER
OUTSIDE OF THE SOCK.
AND THAT'S A SPACE I THINK
I'M ABLE TO HELP YOU GUYS IN.
AND THEN THERE'S ONE --
MARK.
RIGHT. AND I THINK, AGAIN,
NOW THAT WE'RE FULL-TIME,
WE FINALLY HAVE TIME
TO SCALE THIS THING.
AND IF WE DID WHAT WE DID
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
PART-TIME,
WE ARE PLACING MASSIVE BETS
ON OURSELVES
AND OUR FAMILIES'
LIVELIHOODS
THAT WE'RE GONNA GROW
THIS THING, SO...
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, I HAVE AN INTEREST.
I'LL DO A STRAIGHT-UP
250K FOR 20%.
WE'VE GOT FACILITIES
IN DALLAS.
WE CAN TAKE OVER
YOUR ACCOUNTING.
WE CAN TAKE BACK OFFICE.
YOU CAN WORK
WITH ALL OUR TECH GUYS.
I LIKE TROY'S IDEA
OF NARRATIVE.
I THINK HE BRINGS
A UNIQUE SKILL SET THERE.
I THINK YOUR STRENGTH IS,
YOU KNOW,
THE TECHNICAL SIDE,
THE CONVERSION SIDE.
I THINK WE --
YOU KNOW, WE CAN AMP IT UP.
WE CAN DO THINGS
WITH THE MAVS.
THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF PROMOTIONAL OPS.
SO YOUR OFFER'S
$250,000, 20% --
50/50 TO TROY,
IF HE WANTS THAT DEAL.
YEAH, TROY, IF YOU WANT TO COME
IN WITH ME, WE'LL SPLIT IT.
OKAY, MARK,
I'LL DO THAT DEAL.
SO, WITH YOU GUYS SPLITTING,
IT WOULD BE 20%...
-TOTAL.
-TOTAL.
250K FOR 20% TOTAL.
TROY AND I WILL SPLIT IT
DOWN THE MIDDLE.
SO EXPENSIVE.
DUDES, LET'S DO THIS!
-DEAL.
-DEAL.
I LIKE TO MIX A LITTLE BUSINESS
AND PLEASURE TOGETHER SOMETIMES.
SO I'VE ASKED
SOME OF MY BEST COMPANIES --
BOTTLE BREACHER, HONEYFUND,
AND WICKED GOOD CUPCAKES --
TO COME TO THE WEDDING
AND GIVE THEIR PRODUCTS
AND SERVICES
TO THE GROOM AND BRIDE.
SO, SHOW ME WHAT YOU BROUGHT.
IT'S THE ONE TIME IN YOUR LIFE
WHERE YOU'RE COMPLETELY
IRRATIONAL ABOUT PRICE.
Sara: KEVIN'S ATTENTION
TO OUR BUSINESS
HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY
LIFE-CHANGING.
IN THE EIGHT MONTHS
SINCE AIRING,
GET 1,000 LOCATIONS,
10 TIMES THE SIZE.
TO YOU, AS A ONE-MAN OPERATOR,
THAT'S MONEY IN THE BANK, RIGHT?
YOU'RE SMILING ALL THE WAY.
BUT NOW,
OUT OF 115 LOCATIONS,
YOU MADE $28,000,
AND EVEN IF YOU DOUBLE THAT,
YOU'VE MADE $56,000.
-YEAH, BUT YOU'RE SPEAKING --
-THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
YOU'RE SPEAKING ON THE SAME
PRINCIPLES AND BUSINESS MODEL
THAT UBER'S ESTABLISHED ON,
OR LYFT.
O'Leary:
NO, NO. IT'S DIFFERENT.
NO, WE'RE NOT. NO, WE'RE NOT.
IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.
THERE IS A PRINTABLE FEE
THAT GOES TO THE DRIVER,
AND THERE IS A FEE
THAT'S ADDED ON TOP.
LET'S USE UBER
AS THE EXAMPLE, RIGHT?
THERE'S A REASON WHY
THEY'RE OKAY LOSING MONEY --
'CAUSE THEY'VE RAISED
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, RIGHT?
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE
JUST TRYING TO BUILD A BRAND...
YEAH.
...TRYING TO GET PEOPLE --
WHEN THEY THINK TRANSPORTATION,
THINK UBER.
BUT THE BIGGER POINT
IS THEY CAN LIVE OFF OF CRUMBS
BASED OFF OF THE VOLUME.
YOU'RE NOT IN A POSITION
TO LIVE OFF OF CRUMBS.
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CRUMBS
OUT THERE
TO MAKE THE MONEY,
REAL MONEY.
I INVESTED IN UBER
IN 2011...
I'M AWARE.
...WHEN IT WAS ONLY
IN SAN FRANCISCO,
AND UBER WAS GOING
AFTER THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM.
YOU KNOW, AND THE SIZE
OF THE MARKET BECAME HUMONGOUS.
AND I THINK WITH ValPark,
THAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER
A VERY NICHE MARKET.
IT'S NOT PROVEN YET.
IT'S 115 LOCATIONS
IN A TRI-STATE AREA.
THAT'S NOT A LOT
OF REAL ESTATE RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY CAN
COME IN YOUR OWN MARKET
AND TAKE THAT MARKET.
NO ONE CAN COME INTO MY MARKET
AND TAKE IT AWAY.
YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING
YOUR COMPETITION.
THERE'S ANOTHER KID
IN A GARAGE
THAT WANTS TO EAT YOUR LUNCH
RIGHT NOW.
I OWN THE MAJORITY SHARE.
YOU THINK YOU OWN IT,
BUT NEVER UNDERESTIMATE --
THAT HAD A LOT MORE TIME
THAN WE DID.
HE'LL MAKE MONEY.
IT'LL BE A GOOD BUSINESS
FOR HIM.
BUT IT WON'T BE BIG ENOUGH
TO MAKE AN INVESTOR MONEY.
YEAH.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK IS
A TWIST ON A CLASSIC ACCESSORY.
HI, SHARKS.
I'M ADAM TEAGUE.
AND I'M TIM PASLAY.
WE'RE THE TWO GUYS BOW TIE
COMPANY FROM TULSA, OKLAHOMA.
WE'RE SEEKING $150,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
WE HAVEN'T ALL BEEN BLESSED
WITH MR. WONDERFUL'S STRIKING
GOOD LOOKS AND ENDEARING CHARM.
SOME OF US MERE MORTALS,
WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP.
AND WE RELY ON OUR CLOTHES
TO STAND OUT.
I MEAN, GUYS,
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
YOU'RE AN ELIGIBLE BACHELOR
AT A FRIEND'S WEDDING
TRYING TO GET BRIDESMAID NUMBER
THREE TO DANCE WITH YOU,
OR AT LEAST NOTICE YOU.
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE --
SAME OLD SUIT AND TIE.
THAT ACTUALLY AGE WITH WEAR
AND GROW EVEN FINER OVER TIME.
SO, SHARKS, JOIN US,
AND WE'RE SURE TO MAKE MONEY.
KNOCK ON WOOD.
WE'D LOVE TO HAND OUT
SOME SAMPLES,
IF YOU GUYS ARE ALL RIGHT
WITH THAT.
PLEASE.
FINALLY, A MAN WHO GETS IT RIGHT
AND STARTS ON THIS END.
-THAT'S RIGHT.
-I WAS JUST GONNA SAY...
TROY, I GOT A BLACK FEDORA
FOR YOU.
I LIKE THREE TIMES
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES --
WHEN THEY'RE BORN,
WHEN THEY GET MARRIED,
AND WHEN THEY DIE
BECAUSE THEY THROW CAUTION
TO THE WIND ON PRICING.
I'D LIKE TO INCLUDE THIS
ON MY PLATFORM OF LOVE,
AND I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER HERE.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $150,000,
BUT I WANT 15%.
-I THINK I ADD A LOT OF VALUE.
-YEAH.
I MEAN,
THAT'S A GREAT OFFER.
WE'D LOVE TO KIND OF CONSIDER
THAT WITH --
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN BRINGING IN A PARTNER
THAT HAS MAYBE
A DIFFERENT SKILL SET?
DEPENDS WHICH ONE.
YES, HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME,
GUYS.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
I APPRECIATE THE SHOUT-OUT.
I LIKE THIS
IN MY PORTFOLIO.
WHAT ABOUT
WITH YOUR MO'S BOWS?
YES, I DO HAVE A MENTOR.
HE'S 12 YEARS OLD.
HIS NAME IS MO'S BOWS.
HE'S A VICIOUS BUSINESSMAN.
I SEE THAT YOU GUYS
NEED LICENSING
AND PROBABLY
THE FASHION EXPERIENCE,
SO THAT MEANS
THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO WORK
ADAM AND TIM HAVE TWO OFFERS
ON THE TABLE
FROM DAYMOND AND KEVIN
FOR THEIR WOODEN-ACCESSORY
COMPANY, TWO GUYS BOW TIES.
BUT THEY'VE ASKED DAYMOND
IF HE'D BE INTERESTED
IN PARTNERING WITH TROY
ON A DEAL.
I THINK THAT TROY AND I --
I WOULD NEED TO GO UP TO 30%
'CAUSE I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO GET UP AND MAKE A FAIR SHARE
OF MONEY OFF OF THIS.
BUT YOU STILL
HAVE TO ASK HIM.
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAYMOND...
IF THESE GUYS ARE WILLING
TO GO UP TO 30% FOR THAT PRICE,
I THINK WE'D MAKE GOOD PARTNERS
ON THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
SO, 30%'S A LITTLE HIGHER
THAN WE ARE WANTING TO GO.
I'M TAKING OFF THE HAT, GUYS.
SO OUR COUNTER WOULD
PROBABLY BE 20%
WITH A 5% ROYALTY UNTIL YOU GOT
YOUR INVESTMENT BACK.
Teague: IT'S EMOTIONAL
TO TAKE SOMETHING
THAT YOU'VE WORKED TO BUILD
SO HARD
AND THEN TO GIVE
A PIECE OF THAT AWAY,
BUT WE FEEL LIKE WITH DAYMOND,
WE GET SO MUCH IN RETURN.
HIS EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE
IN THIS INDUSTRY
IS GONNA BE AMAZING FOR US.
NERDWAX WILL SIMPLY WEAR OFF
NATURALLY OVER TIME.
AND THAT'S IT.
WE'VE ALREADY CHANGED
THE WAY
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
WEAR THEIR GLASSES,
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO MAKE IT MILLIONS.
SO, WHO WANTS TO WAX ON
WITH US?
AND STOP THE SLIDE?
[ CHUCKLES ]
-WOW.
-OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
THAT'S THE EXCITING PART --
WE JUST STARTED.
APRIL OF LAST YEAR,
WE BEGAN SELLING
DIRECT TO THE CONSUMER
ONLINE VIA OUR WEBSITE.
AND WHEN WE STARTED DOING THAT,
WE GOT A TON OF PUSH ONLINE.
WE WERE FEATURED IN MASHABLE,
UNCRATE, BUZZFEED, AOL.
YOU'RE GETTING --
I CALL IT P.R. VIAGRA, RIGHT?
YOU'RE GETTING ALL THESE --
YEAH, WE HAVE TONS OF SPIKES
AND VALLEYS.
ALL YOUR SPIKES THAT RELATE
TO WHEN YOU GET MEDIA, RIGHT?
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITHOUT MEDIA?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN THE MEDIA DIES?
SO, WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE
DOING WHAT WORKS.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE MEASURING
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO ON SOCIAL.
SO WE'RE GOING OUT THERE,
AND WE'RE JUST STIRRING UP
THE CONVERSATION.
WE'RE GONNA KEEP DOING
WHAT WE DO BETTER,
AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO IMPROVE ON IT.
HOW MANY RE-ORDERS
ARE YOU GETTING
FROM THE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST?
WE'VE ESTIMATED
THAT YOU'LL GET
SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS
OUT OF A SINGLE TUBE.
SO JUST NOW,
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE
PEOPLE COME BACK
AND RE-ORDER.
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME.
Greiner: YEAH, 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
RUN OUT THAT FAST.
-YOU JUST USE A LITTLE BIT.
-IT DOESN'T RUN OUT THAT FAST.
YOU JUST USE A LITTLE BIT.
EIGHT MONTHS IS AN ETERNITY
BEFORE THE RE-PURCHASE.
I AGREE.
I WOULD MAKE THE TUBE
SMALLER, THINNER,
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S LIP BALM.
AND I WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT
BY 60%.
SO I'M BASICALLY ONLY SELLING
90 DAYS' WORTH OF SUPPLY.
I'D DROP THE PRICE
TO $3.99, TO $4.99.
AND THEN I'D FIND OUT
THE SWEET SPOT.
NOBODY'S GONNA SPEND $10
ON NERDWAX.
IT'S TOO MUCH MONEY.
THAT'S THE WORST THING
THEY COULD EVER DO.
THIS IS THE ONLY TIME
YOU NEED TO VALUE SWEAT,
WHICH IS SWEAT EQUITY.
OH, AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE PUTTING IN.
IN A YEAR FROM NOW, THAT 20%
WILL BE WORTH SO MUCH MORE.
SO WE'RE PUTTING IT IN, AND
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT.
WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF WORK.
WE'VE PROVEN THAT.
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.
WE'RE SCRAPPY.
WE'RE GONNA HUSTLE.
GUYS, I BEG YOU NOT TO TAKE IN
ANY MONEY RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW THAT WE TOOK A RISK
IN BEING HERE EARLY,
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME,
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET UP THERE
AND CRUSH IT.
SO I KNOW
THAT WE CAN DO THIS.
AND I KNOW THAT GOING
BEYOND THIS,
WE'RE GONNA
JUST FIGURE IT OUT.
HERE'S THE ONLY WAY I WOULD
DO THIS DEAL, ALL RIGHT?
I'M A MARKETING GENIUS, OKAY?
I KNOW THAT ABOUT MYSELF.
THE WAY THIS THING WORKS,
FOR ME,
IS YOU'RE SO EARLY,
YET YOU DO NEED CAPITAL.
THIS IS VENTURE DEBT.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I WOULD DO IT.
HERE COMES
HIS BLOOD-SUCKING OFFER.
SILENCE.
I WANT SILENCE
SO THEY CAN HEAR THE OFFER.
I THINK YOU'RE A PRODUCT,
NOT A COMPANY.
SO I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU
$80,000,
BUT I WANT 10% OF SALES
UNTIL I GET $240,000 BACK.
AND BECAUSE I'M MR. WONDERFUL,
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
3% OF THE COMPANY.
LISTEN, LET'S DEAL
WITH THE TRUTH, OKAY?
IT'S A PRODUCT.
IT'S NOT A COMPANY.
GUYS, I THINK
TRYING TO GO HIGH-VOLUME --
BIGGEST MISTAKE
YOU CAN MAKE.
GO FROM $100,000 IN SALES
TO $500,000
TO $1 MILLION IN SALES,
AND, OH, YOU'LL BE MAKING
$900,000 A YEAR.
-IT COULD BE A WHOLE LOT WORSE.
-YEAH.
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU TRY TO GET
TOO BIG TOO FAST,
YEAH. SO, AT THIS TIME,
I THINK THAT WE --
I THINK THAT WE RESPECTFULLY
HAVE TO DECLINE THOSE OFFERS.
YES!
YOU TOOK MY ADVICE!
OKAY.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
NERDWAX GUYS,
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR COMPANY, GUYS.
