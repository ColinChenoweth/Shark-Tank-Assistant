YOU DON'T JUST WANT MONEY.
YOU WANT A PARTNER.
I LOVE A GUY
THAT'S WILLING TO GIVE ADVICE,
BUT HE WON'T WRITE A CHECK.
Narrator:
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS MUST GET
THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR
OR THEY'LL WALK AWAY
WITH NOTHING.
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
$900,000
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.
YOU'RE RIGHT ON TREND.
WHERE ARE YOU CURRENTLY
SELLING THESE?
NOWHERE.
I KNEW THAT WE TOOK A RISK
IN BEING HERE EARLY.
-HUGE MISTAKE.
-YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS,
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
MORE THAN 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
MARK CUBAN,
ESTEEMED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
AND TROY CARTER.
HE CLIMBED HIS WAY UP
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY LADDER
FROM THE TOUGH NEIGHBORHOODS
OF PHILADELPHIA
TO BECOME A POWERHOUSE
TALENT MANAGER
WITH HIS MEDIA COMPANY
ATOM FACTORY.
HIS ANGEL AND TECH FUNDS
HAVE 70-PLUS INVESTMENTS
IN HIGH-PROFILE COMPANIES LIKE
POP CHIPS, UBER, AND SPOTIFY.
FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A BUSINESS
THAT REGULARLY BRINGS A HAPPY
SURPRISE TO YOUR MAILBOX.
RIGHT.
SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
MUCH INVENTORY ISSUES
'CAUSE WE CAN ALWAYS PUSH
THROUGH IT.
SO RIGHT NOW IS, WHAT, $60,000
MONTH-OVER-MONTH REVENUE?
IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY
BECAUSE WE'RE SO SEASONAL.
SO, YOU KNOW, FOR HOLIDAYS,
LIKE IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY --
I THINK WHEN VALENTINE'S
WAS OVER,
WE ENDED UP HAVING
ABOUT 12,000 SUBSCRIBERS
FIRST MONTH,
I DON'T LIKE IT.
THE SECOND MONTH,
I DON'T LIKE, SAY, THE DESIGN.
IS THERE AN OPTION FOR ME
TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS,
I WANT TO START
PICKING MY SOCK"?
NOT RIGHT NOW. NO.
I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER WANT TO GET THERE.
BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD FOR YOU
TO HAVE THAT?
RIGHT.
IF YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN
INVENTORY SKEWS
BASED ON DEMAND
AND SELECTION,
THIS WHOLE MODEL
GOES OUT THE WINDOW.
I DON'T KNOW TIME FRAMES
IN TERMS OF GETTING MONEY BACK.
I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE
SURE WE'RE GONNA GET $3 MILLION.
O'Leary:
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS,
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE MANY OPTIONS
OF WHERE WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE HIGHEST
RETURN, LOWEST RISK.
YOU KNOW,
I WOULD SAY THIS --
WE BOOTSTRAPPED
THIS COMPANY.
WE PUT $6,000 OF OUR OWN CASH
INTO IT. THAT'S IT.
-IN THREE YEARS.
-GOOD FOR YOU GUYS.
SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO GROW
THAT SUBSCRIPTION MODEL
WITH JUST FINDING
NEW CUSTOMERS.
WE FOUND, YOU KNOW,
EARLY ON,
PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS WAS A THING,
SO WE'VE GOT TO GET
IN FRONT OF MORE PEOPLE.
I THINK THEY'RE CUTE,
BUT IT'S A VERY CROWDED MARKET.
TO ME, YOU'RE NOT DOING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
JUST DOING IT
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
SURE.
I'M NOT SURE HOW I WOULD MAKE
BACK MY $250,000 VERY QUICKLY.
I'M OUT.
-OKAY.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YEAH, THANKS, LORI.
SO, YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW,
THIS NEVER HAPPENS,
WHERE I ACTUALLY GIVE AN OFFER
TO TWO GUYS IN THEIR UNDERWEAR.
[ LAUGHS ]
I WILL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 22.5%.
AND IT HAS TO BE CONTINGENT
THAT MY BAMBAS PARTNERS
WANT TO WORK
WITH THE DEAL.
I HAVE TO BE GOOD PARTNERS
TO THEM.
-AWESOME.
-OKAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000 FOR 15%
WITH SOME SCHEDULE OF RETURNS
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY SEE
A SOCK-SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS
DOING AN I.P.O.
ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
SO, WHAT SCHEDULE?
YEAH, WHAT DOES THAT
LOOK LIKE?
DO QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO
EVERYBODY, INCLUDING YOURSELVES.
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU START TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY.
THEN THERE'S MARK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
ONE GUY LEFT.
THE DALLAS GUY.
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.
AND THEN THERE'S MARK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
-ONE GUY LEFT.
-THE DALLAS GUY.
SEE, THESE GUYS --
OTHER THAN TROY --
THEY'RE, "WHAT CAN YOU
GIVE ME BACK IMMEDIATELY?"
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN,
HOW BIG CAN WE GET?
-DONE.
-WHOO!
-YEAH, BOY!
-YEAH, BOY!
-LET'S DO THIS.
-ABSOLUTELY.
-IT'LL BE FUN.
-THANKS, GUYS.
-TAKE CARE.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OH, MY GOSH!
HE'S DOING A HAPPY DANCE.
BOOM!
HOLY COW!
YOU THINK THEY CAN GET
A $10 MILLION VALUATION,
RIGHT, LIKE --
-OH, EASY RIGHT NOW, YEAH.
-RIGHT TODAY.
OUR FAMILIES HAVE MADE
A TON OF SACRIFICES,
AND FOR OTHER PEOPLE,
LIKE MARK AND TROY,
TO SEE THE POTENTIAL
IN WHAT FOOT CARDIGAN HAS
AND WHERE IT CAN GO,
UM, I MEAN, I CAN'T --
I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT
INTO WORDS.
WE'VE ALREADY DONE
$738,000 IN REVENUE.
Eli: WHEN WE WERE PITCHING
ON "SHARK TANK,"
WE HAD $640,000 IN SALES.
IT'S ONLY BEEN SEVEN MONTHS,
AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE
$4.2 MILLION.
Tracey: SINCE PARTNERING
WITH KEVIN TWO YEARS AGO,
OUR SALES HAVE NOW CLIMBED
TO $5.5 MILLION.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT.
AS A SHARK, WHEN I INVEST,
I'M ALWAYS TRYING
TO FIT COMPANIES TOGETHER.
HOW CAN I MAKE THEM STRONGER?
HOW CAN WE COOPERATE
IN MARKETING TO GROW SALES?
THIS IS THE POWER
OF "SHARK TANK."
I INVESTED
IN THESE THREE COMPANIES.
NOW WE'RE BUILDING OUR FUTURE
ON THE SOMETHING WONDERFUL
PLATFORM.
WE'RE GONNA GROW THIS
TO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A MODERN SOLUTION TO
ALLEVIATE THE HASSLE OF PARKING.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CASH.
AND THEN WHAT?
YOU DRIVE AROUND IN CIRCLES
LOOKING FOR A PARKING SPACE
YOU MAY NEVER FIND?
OR EVEN WORSE, YOU GO TO AN ATM.
WHERE'S THE CONVENIENCE IN THAT?
ENTER ValPark MOBILE.
ValPark MOBILE HELPS YOU
FIND AND PAY FOR VALET
AT LOCATIONS
SUCH AS RESTAURANTS, HOTELS,
NIGHT CLUBS,
AND EVEN SPORTING ARENAS, MARK.
READY TO LEAVE?
USE OUR APP
TO THEN REQUEST YOUR CAR
AND THEN HAVE IT WAITING
OUTSIDE FOR YOU.
WITH YOUR HELP,
WE CAN MAKE THIS $40 BILLION
ANTIQUATED PARKING INDUSTRY
ValPark MOBILE STANDARD.
LET'S BRING THE CONVENIENCE
BACK TO VALET.
ANY QUESTIONS, SHARKS?
O'Leary:
I HAVE A QUESTION.
LET'S SAY I HAVE
A RESTAURANT,
AND I HAVE A VERY BUOYANT
VALET BUSINESS.
I'M PARKING
250 CARS A NIGHT.
TELL ME HOW YOU ADD VALUE
TO MY SITUATION.
YOU COME TO ME AS AN OWNER
AND SAY...
SKIMMING AMONG VALET PROVIDERS,
IT'S KIND OF ACCEPTED LOSS,
UP TO 30%, IN FACT,
'CAUSE IT'S CASH.
ValPark MOBILE ELIMINATES
A GOOD PORTION OF THAT
BY ALLOWING NOT ONLY
MOBILE TRANSACTIONS,
BUT CREDIT-CARD TRANSACTIONS.
Greiner: I'M NOT SURE I FULLY
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS.
CAN YOU SHOW US?
YES, CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US?
SO, YOU WOULD DOWNLOAD
OUR APP.
YOU MAKE A PROFILE --
MARK HAS MADE A PROFILE HERE --
WITH YOUR NAME,
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS,
AND YOUR CREDIT-CARD NUMBER.
WHEN YOU CREATE A PROFILE,
YOU ACTUALLY CREATE A SECURE PIN
THAT IS ASSOCIATED
WITH YOUR PROFILE.
SO YOU NEVER TAKE YOUR PHONE
OUT OF YOUR POCKET
WHEN YOU'RE PARKING WITH US.
ALL THE ATTENDANT ASKS FOR
IS YOUR NAME.
-AND YOUR PIN.
-YOU SAY YOUR NAME.
YOU PUT YOUR PIN IN.
YOU'RE CHARGED.
-THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DONE.
-RIGHT.
SO, RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE CLOSING UP YOUR TAB,
YOU REQUEST YOUR VEHICLE.
ALL ATTENDANTS AT THAT LOCATION
WITH THE DEVICE GETS AN ALERT.
I THEN GET AN ALERT
SAYING MY VEHICLE
WILL BE OUTSIDE
IN THREE TO FIVE MINUTES.
WHEN IT'S OUTSIDE,
I THEN GET A SECONDARY ALERT,
AND MY VEHICLE'S OUTSIDE
AND READY TO GO.
HOW MANY LOCATIONS
ARE YOU IN RIGHT NOW?
CURRENTLY,
WE'RE AT OVER 115.
-GOOD FOR YOU.
-IN WHICH MARKETS?
WE'RE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,
MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA.
-GOOD FOR YOU.
-AND YOU CREATED THIS YOURSELF?
I DESIGNED THIS MYSELF.
I WIRE-FRAMED THIS, CONCEPTED
THIS, I DID ALL THE ASSETS.
MY BUSINESS PARTNER OWNS
THE LARGEST VALET COMPANY
ON THE EAST COAST.
AND WHAT'S YOUR ARRANGEMENT
WITH YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER?
HE OWNS
46% OF THE BUSINESS.
MM-HMM.
WE DON'T TAKE THEIR PRINCIPAL.
NOW, ARE YOU SAYING
YOU DID $270,000 GROSS,
AND THEN TO YOU,
BASICALLY,
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
APPROXIMATELY $25,000?
$28,000.
THIS YEAR,
OUR NEW BUSINESS MODEL --
WE'VE MOVED
TO $15% CONVENIENCE FEE.
WE SPLIT THE CREDIT-CARD FEE
DOWN THE MIDDLE
WITH THE PROVIDER.
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE
A $49-PER-MONTH FEE
FOR EACH LOCATION
AS A VENDOR.
THIS IS A VERY, VERY OLD MARKET
IN AN INDUSTRY
THAT THEY HAVE NOT EVER SEEN
AN URGE OR NEED TO IMPROVE UPON.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
IN TECH RIGHT NOW
IS IT'S A COPYCAT MARKET.
SO THE MOMENT
YOU GET SOME HEAT,
THIS IS GONNA SCALE VERY QUICKLY
AROUND THE WORLD.
HOW DO YOU PREVENT YOURSELF
FROM ONLY BEING STUCK
IN THAT TRI-STATE AREA?
HOW DO YOU GET TO SCALE
MORE QUICKLY?
I NEED AN AMBASSADOR
IN EACH CITY.
HAVE YOU TRIED
TO RAISE MONEY?
SO, ALL THIS WAS DONE BY MYSELF
OUT OF MY OWN MONEY SO FAR.
-HOW MUCH?
-$100,000 MYSELF.
-DAMN. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
-YOU'RE IN.
YEAH, I'M IN IT TILL THE END.
SO...
I SEE IT WORK, RIGHT?
I MEAN, IT DOES
WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO.
THE PROBLEM, LIKE,
WITH A LOT OF APPS
IS HOW MUCH MONEY
CAN YOU ACTUALLY MAKE?
49 BUCKS PER LOCATION,
RIGHT?
YOU DON'T OWN IT.
I OWN THE MAJORITY SHARE, AND I
JUST DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.
THERE'S NO FEASIBLE SCENARIO.
I DON'T SEE MY INVESTMENT
HAPPENING. I'M OUT.
I RESPECT YOUR CONFIDENCE.
I RESPECT YOUR EFFORT.
BUT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE WORTH
INVESTING 300K,
I'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE
SOMETHING BIG.
I TURNED DOWN UBER.
I WAS THE FIRST GUY HE WENT TO.
I TOLD HIM
IT WAS GONNA BE TOO HARD
TO GET PAST
ALL THE TAXICAB COMMISSIONS
AND THAT HE'D HAVE TO RAISE
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
SO I WAS THE BIG IDIOT
THAT SAID NO.
I'M HOPING I'M GONNA BE
JUST AS BIG AN IDIOT FOR YOU
AND THAT YOU GET JUST AS BIG.
YEAH.
BUT I DON'T SEE IT SCALING
BIG ENOUGH TO GET A RETURN.
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND.
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T SEE THE VISION
FOR WORLD DOMINATION
OF VALET-PARKING SYSTEMS HERE.
I JUST DON'T.
I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU KNOW,
YOU ALREADY HAVE A GREAT PARTNER
WHO'S AT 46%, RIGHT?
SO THAT, FOR ME,
IS WHERE I HAVE A PROBLEM.
I LIKE HAVING A PARTNERSHIP
WHERE I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED.
I DON'T FEEL IT'S RIGHT FOR ME
TO TAKE 30% OF YOUR COMPANY,
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORTH MY TIME
TO TAKE ANYTHING LESS,
SO I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND.
OKAY, ONE SHARK LEFT,
I THINK.
I SEE THIS
AS A VALUABLE PROPERTY.
I SEE THIS AS SOMETHING
THAT CAN GROW INTO CAR WASHES,
GAS STATIONS,
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE...
-EXACTLY.
-...WHERE, YOU KNOW,
MY DAUGHTERS OR MY WIFE
OR MY MOTHER,
THEY DON'T WANT TO GET
OUT OF THE CAR,
BUT I WOULD DESPERATELY NEED
A MARK, A TROY --
WHO UNDERSTANDS SOFTWARE
AND TECHNOLOGY TO BE MY PARTNER.
SO I NEED ONE OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS IN.
AND IF ANYBODY
WANTS TO COME BACK IN,
THEN I'M OKAY WITH $300,000
FOR 20%.
BUT THEY KNOW
BETTER THAN I DO.
IT'S SCALABLE TO EVEN THE POINT
OF HOME ACCESS TO YOUR OWN HOME.
SEE IF YOU CAN GET
ANOTHER SHARK BACK IN.
YEAH, I JUST DON'T SEE IT
BEING BIG ENOUGH. I'M SORRY.
TROY?
YOU'RE NOT PARANOID ENOUGH
FOR ME.
I LOVE A PARANOID FOUNDER...
RIGHT? [ LAUGHS ]
...WHO THINKS THERE'S SOMEBODY
IN A GARAGE
WAITING TO EAT HIS LUNCH.
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WITH THAT BEING SAID...
...I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
-GOOD LUCK.
-GOOD LUCK.
-GO OUT AND CRUSH IT, MAN.
-GOOD LUCK.
WE'VE DONE THIS
ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET.
WE'RE GETTING MORE TRACTION.
WE'RE JUST GETTING RAMPED UP.
WE'RE FAR AHEAD OF COMPETITION
BUT DON'T WORRY.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THE CROWD
WITH ONE OF OUR WOODEN BOW TIES.
WE CLEARLY CANNOT HELP YOU
WITH THE ELECTRIC SLIDE
OR THE WOBBLE,
BUT WE CAN AT LEAST
GET YOU IN THE GAME.
OUR HAND-CRAFTED ACCESSORIES
WILL MAKE A STATEMENT
ON THE DANCE FLOOR,
AT THE OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY,
OR ON YOUR NEXT HOT DATE.
OUR BOW TIES ARE MADE USING
OLD-SCHOOL CRAFTSMANSHIP.
WE USE A VARIETY
OF EXOTIC HARDWOODS
LIKE PERUVIAN WALNUT
OR AFRICAN ZEBRA WOOD.
BUT OUR MODERN STYLE DOESN'T
STOP WITH OUR BOW TIES.
TWO GUYS CAN SPRUCE UP
YOUR LAPEL, YOUR POCKET,
AND WE'RE EXTREMELY EXCITED
TO SHARE WITH YOU
OUR UNIQUE TAKE
ON THE TRADITIONAL FEDORA.
THESE ARE BEAUTIFULLY
CRAFTED PIECES
OH, I DON'T GET A HAT?
WE FOUND OUT
YOU HAVE A REALLY BIG HEAD,
-AND NOT JUST YOUR EGO.
-[ LAUGHS ]
Greiner:
[ LAUGHS ] IT'S CUTE.
THERE YOU GO,
MR. WONDERFUL.
-THANK YOU.
-UH-HUH.
THIS IS THE SKYLINE
OF CHICAGO.
-YOU GOT IT.
-HOW CREATIVE.
-THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
-YOU GOT IT.
SO, WHERE ARE YOU CURRENTLY
SELLING THESE?
NOWHERE.
THOSE ARE JUST GETTING
READY TO LAUNCH.
WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO A MARKET
IN ATLANTA HERE NEXT MONTH.
HOW MUCH DOES
THE BOW TIE COST?
THE CORE PRODUCT,
I ASSUME IS THE BOW TIE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU STARTED WITH,
RIGHT?
WE STARTED WITH THE BOW TIE.
THE BOW TIE RETAILS
FROM $45 TO $95.
AND WHAT'S IT COST FOR YOU
TO MAKE ONE OF THESE?
BOW TIES -- ABOUT $7.50.
AND WHERE AND HOW ARE YOU
SELLING THESE NOW?
THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES
COME THROUGH OUR WEBSITE.
WE OBVIOUSLY LOVE THAT.
WE GET TO KEEP
THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY.
75% OF THE SALES
COME THROUGH THE WEBSITE.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN SALES
LAST YEAR?
SO, LAST YEAR,
WE DID $407,000.
WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS
FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 YEARS.
WE'VE DONE
JUST SHY OF $1 MILLION.
WOW.
SO, WE DO CUSTOM
REALLY WELL.
WE CAN CUSTOMIZE THE FRONT
OF THESE TO BE ANYTHING.
WE SHIP OUT CUSTOM ORDERS
NEXT DAY.
BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS
AND THE WAY WE PROCESS THINGS,
WE CAN DO
ABOUT 1,000 BOW TIES A WEEK.
YOUR LOGISTICS
ARE AMAZING, THEN.
-WE SHIP OUT --
-AND THAT'S YOUR KEY?
YOUR SATISFACTION
IS IMMEDIATE?
WE HAVE SOLD
OVER 25,000 PIECES.
WE HAVE HAD LESS THAN
30 RETURNS FOR DEFECT.
HOW ARE YOU CURRENTLY GETTING
THE WORD OUT ON THE PRODUCT?
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS
ON TASTEMAKERS
AND STYLE INFLUENCERS.
WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD.
I'M AN AVID NBA FAN,
SO A NATURAL OUTLET FOR ME
WAS THE NBA.
MIKE CONLEY WAS THE ONE
WHO WORE OUR BOW TIE
DURING THE NBA PLAYOFFS,
AND IT ACTUALLY --
HE GOT NOTICED
DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE.
THEY DID A SEPARATE INTERVIEW,
THE GUYS ON "INSIDE THE NBA."
CHUCK, SHAQ, ERNIE --
WE SENT THEM SOME.
THEY WORE THEM.
THEY ALL TALKED ABOUT IT.
DID YOU SEE A SALES LIFT
AFTER THAT?
DEFINITELY.
DEFINITELY, YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.
Carter:
I LOVE THIS STORY.
I THINK THE FEDORAS
ARE FANTASTIC.
YOU ACTUALLY SHOULD MAKE IT
A LITTLE SMALLER FOR MY HEAD.
LOOKS REALLY GOOD
ON DAYMOND.
AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY
MORE OF HIS EXPERTISE
THAN IT IS MINE.
AND FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
WE'LL GET YOU A SMALLER FEDORA.
WE GOT ONE FOR YOU.
LET ME ASK YOU GUYS
A QUESTION ABOUT THIS.
AND I WANT YOUR FEEDBACK
ON IT.
YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT A LOT OF COMPANIES
INVOLVED IN THE WEDDING
AND SPECIAL EVENTS SPACE.
ALL WE HEAR.
HONEYFUND, BOTTLE BREACHER,
WICKED GOOD CUPCAKES,
O'LEARY WINES.
I CALL IT MR. WONDERFUL'S
PLATFORM OF LOVE.
-OH, GOD.
-SO WHAT I TRY AND DO
IS INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO USE
ALL THE SERVICES
WHEN THEY HAVE A WEDDING
OR AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY.
-THAT'S THE IDEA.
-YEAH.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT FIT?
HOW MUCH DOES THIS
FIT INTO THAT?
SO, THE PLATFORM OF LOVE --
THE BOW TIES ARE GONNA BE
A GREAT FIT FOR THAT.
THE LAPELS AND POCKET SQUARES,
AS WELL,
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT
THEIR WEDDING TO BE DIALED IN.
WE ACTUALLY EVEN ALLOW PEOPLE,
IF THEY WANT TO,
TO MAIL US
THEIR OWN FABRIC,
AND WE CAN MAKE THE BOW TIES
OUT OF THAT.
A LITTLE BIT HARDER
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU JUST WANT THE MONEY,
SO I'LL GIVE YOU 150K FOR 20%.
OKAY.
THAT'S EXCELLENT.
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
WE'D LOVE TO, IF IT'S OKAY,
OUT OF RESPECT
FOR THE OTHER SHARKS HERE,
IF THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE...
YOU GUYS,
I'LL SIMPLIFY IT SOME --
WHILE I AM A FASHION ICON...
YOU CAN'T MAKE HATS BIG ENOUGH
TO HOLD ALL THESE BRAINS.
SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
Greiner: I WILL TELL YOU,
I THINK YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.
I THINK THAT KEVIN AND DAYMOND
ARE DEFINITELY
BETTER PARTNERS FOR YOU
AS FAR AS MARKETING AND SELLING
THE BOW TIES.
I'D BE A CUSTOMER,
BUT NOT AN INVESTOR.
I'M OUT.
AWESOME. THANK YOU.
-WE LOVE TO HEAR THAT.
-YEAH, DEFINITELY.
DAYMOND,
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED --
TROY, I KNOW YOU SAID
YOU WERE OUT --
BUT IF THERE WAS
A POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP,
OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE
WE FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS DO
BOTH BRING DIFFERENT ASPECTS --
OBVIOUSLY,
YOUR KIND OF NETWORK
WITH DAYMOND'S
FASHION EXPERTISE.
IS THERE A WAY
THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY FIND
A WAY TO WORK
WITH BOTH OF YOU TOGETHER?
I AM NOT ADVERSE
TO WORKING WITH TROY, YOU KNOW,
JUST DUE TO THE FACT
THAT I THINK THAT HE CAN
BRING VALUE
WITH HIS MUSIC RELATIONS.
IF HE WOULD BE INTERESTED,
THEN I THINK THAT TROY AND I --
I WOULD NEED TO GO UP TO 30%
BECAUSE I NEED TO BE ABLE TO
GET UP AND MAKE A FAIR SHARE
OF MONEY OFF OF THIS.
BUT YOU STILL
HAVE TO ASK HIM.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US
A 10% ROYALTY ON THAT?
I MEAN, THE BUMP OF, OBVIOUSLY,
WHAT WE DO
AND BRING THE VALUE TO IT
WILL INCREASE
YOUR NUMBERS GREATLY.
O'Leary:
I'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING
JUST TO MAKE IT COMPETITIVE.
I'LL DROP MY EQUITY ASK
DOWN TO 10%, NOT 15%.
I'LL DROP THE ROYALTY DOWN
TO 7.5%,
AND I'LL PUT IT
ON THE PLATFORM OF LOVE,
WHICH I THINK IS INVALUABLE
FOR YOU GUYS.
OKAY.
I'M OUT.
OOH.
OOH.
THAT'S NASTY, GUYS.
WOW.
BA-BAM, TROY.
HE'S A DISCIPLINED MAN.
I CAN SEE THAT.
WELL, NOW THAT I ALREADY
HAVE A THIRST
FOR THE BLOOD OF 10% ROYALTY,
I'M GONNA KEEP IT AT THAT.
150K, 20% EQUITY, 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL I RECEIVE THE 150K BACK.
WOW.
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
THAT IS EXPENSIVE.
WELL, I'D LOVE TO COUNTER,
IF I COULD.
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE AT 20%
FOR $150,000 WITH A 10% ROYALTY.
-UNTIL THE MONEY IS RECOUPED.
-UNTIL YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO
17.5% WITH A 10% ROYALTY
UNTIL YOU GET
YOUR MONEY BACK?
YOU THINK I'M GONNA ARGUE
OVER 2.5%?
I WOULD HOPE NOT.
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO GUESSES,
BUT YOU'RE ONLY GONNA NEED ONE,
WHAT I'M GONNA SAY.
DEAL.
DONE. LET'S GO.
ALL RIGHT.
APPRECIATE YOU, MAN.
THANK YOU.
Greiner: GOOD DEAL.
AND I'M GONNA MODEL THIS
FOR FREE, MAN.
-ABSOLUTELY. WE APPRECIATE IT.
-LOOKING SHARP IN IT.
TROY, I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING
ME GET A LITTLE BIT MORE.
I'M DON HEJNY.
THIS IS MY WIFE, LYDIA.
AND WE LIVE
IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE,
WITH OUR THREE BEAUTIFUL KIDS,
DIA, ASAIAH, AND LUCY.
I WEAR GLASSES
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
AND SOMETHING HAS ALWAYS
REALLY BOTHERED ME.
ONE DAY,
THE LIGHT BULB WENT OFF,
AND I CAME UP
WITH A REALLY SIMPLE FIX
TO A VERY ANNOYING PROBLEM.
Lydia: AS FIRST-TIME
ENTREPRENEURS,
WE'RE LEARNING AS WE GO,
AND WE DEFINITELY HAD
SOME SETBACKS.
WE'VE TRIED USING
A MANUFACTURER,
BUT WHEN OUR PRODUCT
CAME OFF THE LINE,
THEY WERE ALL DEFECTIVE.
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.
IT PUT US
A MONTH BEHIND SCHEDULE,
AND WE LOST
A TON OF INVENTORY.
WE'RE BACK TO MAKING OUR PRODUCT
BY HAND AT HOME.
WE GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
-YES.
-[ LAUGHS ]
WE NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
TO HELP US SCALE
OUR BUSINESS,
BUT WE ALSO NEED
THE EXPERTISE
OF SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN DOWN
THIS ROAD BEFORE.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE
ANY MORE MISTAKES.
-I WANT TO DO THE LAST ONE.
-OKAY.
Don: THIS BUSINESS MEANS
DOING SOMETHING THAT I LOVE
WHILE BEING WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE.
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
WE GET TO HELP PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE WORLD
MAKE THEIR LIVES
JUST A LITTLE
LESS FRUSTRATING.
IT DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THAT.
-HEY, SHARKS. I'M DON.
-I'M LYDIA.
-DIA.
-AND I'M ASAIAH.
WE'RE THE HEJNYS,
AND OUR COMPANY IS NERDWAX.
WE'RE HERE TODAY SEEKING
AN $80,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 20% EQUITY STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
WE LOVE WEARING GLASSES.
GLASSES AND SUNGLASSES
DON'T JUST HELP US SEE BETTER.
THEY'RE ALSO A FABULOUS WAY
TO SHOW OFF YOUR UNIQUE STYLE.
BUT THOSE OF US
WHO LOVE WEARING GLASSES
ALSO KNOW IT'S HARD TO KEEP
THE GLASSES WE LOVE ON OUR FACE.
YEAH, THEY'RE ALWAYS
SLIDING DOWN OUR NOSE,
AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY
ADJUSTING THEM.
THAT'S WHY MY DAD
INVENTED...
NERDWAX!
NERDWAX!
NERDWAX!
NERDWAX!
Don: NERDWAX
IS A BEESWAX-BASED BLEND
OF ALL-NATURAL AND CERTIFIED
ORGANIC INGREDIENTS
SPECIALLY FORMULATED
TO KEEP YOUR GLASSES IN PLACE.
SO, HOW DOES IT WORK?
-IT'S SUPER SIMPLE.
-IT'S SUPER SIMPLE.
FIRST, YOU'RE GONNA WIPE OFF
YOUR NOSE PADS
OR BRIDGE OF YOUR GLASSES.
AND THEN YOU ROLL
YOUR NERDWAX OUT A GOOD BIT.
AND YOU APPLY IT DIRECTLY
TO THE BRIDGE
OR NOSE PADS
OF YOUR FAVORITE GLASSES.
SO, LYDIA, DIA, AND ASAIAH
ARE GONNA PASS OUT SOME SAMPLES.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
LIKE YOUR GLASSES.
THANK YOU.
LET'S GIVE THESE
TO DAYMOND.
GOOD JOB, BIG GUY.
THANKS.
Don:
TROY, AS YOU'RE PUTTING IT ON,
MAKE SURE YOU ROLL
THE TUBE OUT A GOOD BIT
AND KIND OF USE
THE EDGE OF IT.
THE GREAT THING ABOUT IT
IS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL
THE AMOUNT
THAT YOU PUT ON IT.
SO YOU CAN TRY JUST A LITTLE BIT
AND SEE HOW IT WORKS,
AND YOU CAN GIVE IT
A LITTLE BIT MORE
AND SEE WHAT YOU LIKE
ABOUT IT.
HEY, YOU GUYS DID AWESOME.
-WHOO-HOO!
-GOOD JOB, GUYS.
-GOOD JOB.
-GOOD JOB, GUYS.
-GIVE ME FIVE.
-I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
-BYE, DAD.
-BYE.
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IDEA?
SO, FIVE YEARS AGO,
I WAS A TOURING AUDIO ENGINEER.
I WORKED
IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY,
AND I WORKED OUTSIDE
IN THE SUMMER.
WE DID A TON OF OUTDOOR CONCERTS
AND FESTIVALS.
AND I WOULD GET SUPER SWEATY.
MY GLASSES
WERE ALWAYS SLIDING DOWN.
AND I LOOKED ALL OVER
THE INTERNET FOR A SOLUTION.
EVERYTHING I FOUND
WAS EITHER UNCOMFORTABLE,
IT DIDN'T WORK,
OR IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT-UP UGLY.
SO, IT'S MADE OUT OF BEESWAX?
YEAH, SO, IT'S A BEESWAX BASE,
BUT IT'S A SPECIAL FORMULATION.
SO IT'S NOT ChapStick, ALTHOUGH
WE HAVE THE LIP-BALM CONTAINER.
IT'S A COMPLETELY NEW
FORMULATION.
BUT ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT ARE IN THERE
ARE ALL-NATURAL,
COMPLETELY ORGANIC,
AND THEY'RE COSMETIC-GRADE
INGREDIENTS.
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR FACE
BREAKING OUT
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
WHERE DOES IT SIT AT
ON THE SHELF?
WE SELL ONLINE -- $10.
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE
30 WHOLESALERS.
AND WHAT'S THE COST OF GOODS?
-IT'S 35 CENTS PER TUBE.
-WHOA.
-AT LEAST YOU GOT GOOD MARGINS.
-YOU HAVE A NICE MARGIN.
-WE HAVE GREAT MARGINS, YEAH.
-AND HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
SO, WE HAVE SOLD,
TO DATE...
$136,000.
Cuban: WELL, GOOD.
AND OFF OF THE $136,000,
WE HAVE $65,000 IN PROFIT.
AND, LOOK,
I DON'T CARE WHAT MARK THINKS.
-IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE.
-I'M ALWAYS RIGHT.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE.
THIS IS WHY IT'S NOT WORKING.
-WE'RE PROFITABLE TODAY.
-EXACTLY!
I THINK YOU'D SELL SO MUCH MORE
IF YOUR PRICE WAS WAY LOWER.
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE
A HUGE MISTAKE.
NO, WELL --
TO ME, YOU NEED TO GET OUT
THERE, GET WIDESPREAD...
-NO.
-...AND MOVE VOLUME.
NO.
I DON'T SEE THIS --
WELL, I KNOW YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH ME, MARK,
BUT I'VE SOLD A LOT OF PRODUCT
OVER THE YEARS.
YEAH.
I ALWAYS THINK IT'S SMART
TO CRAWL, THEN WALK, THEN RUN.
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M LYING TO MYSELF IF I SAID,
"I THINK I'LL MAKE BACK
MY MONEY."
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY, SO, IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR ME,
AND I DON'T THINK YOU NEED
THE INVESTMENT. I'M OUT.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
DAYMOND.
WE ARE HERE FOR AN INVESTMENT
FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA USE
THE MONEY FOR?
WE NEED WORKING CAPITAL
TO GROW THIS THING AND SCALE.
WHY GIVE AWAY
PART OF YOUR COMPANY RIGHT NOW
-FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY?
-YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK --
THINGS GO IN DIRECTIONS
YOU DON'T EXPECT.
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN CONTROL
YOUR OWN DESTINY.
THIS IS A GREAT
SMALL BUSINESS,
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY
AN INVESTABLE BUSINESS.
AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
MARK.
I REALLY WANTED TO WORK
WITH YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
TROY'S STILL IN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.
I AGREE, YOU GUYS ARE EARLY,
BUT I LIKE TO BE THERE EARLY.
SO, I WAS ONE OF THE EARLY
INVESTORS IN WARBY PARKER --
THE FASTEST-GROWING GLASSES
COMPANY IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
ALREADY WORTH OVER $1 BILLION.
SO WHAT I WOULD OFFER --
I'D SAY I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $80,000 AS A LOAN
UNTIL I RECOUP $120,000,
PLUS YOU GIVE ME
10% OF THE COMPANY.
KEVIN JR. IN THE HOUSE!
HE HAS LEARNED WISELY.
HE'S GONNA GIVE YOU
THE $80,000,
BUT THE COST BACK
IS MUCH LESS THAN ME.
HE WANTS $120,000 BACK,
BUT THE EQUITY PURCHASE AMOUNT
THAT HE WANTS IS MUCH HIGHER.
IT'S 10%.
I'M PUTTING MORE OF MY RISK
IN THE COMPANY'S ABILITY
TO PAY ME BACK.
I'M SAYING
I'LL GIVE YOU $80,000.
I WANT $240,000 BACK.
BUT YOU DON'T JUST WANT MONEY.
YOU WANT A PARTNER.
YEAH, WE DO.
YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO HELP YOU BUILD THIS BRAND.
YEAH, 'CAUSE ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS SELL 250K WORTH OF PRODUCT,
AND YOU GET
THE SAME AMOUNT OF CASH.
Don: AND WE'RE CONFIDENT
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA
GET THERE NEXT YEAR.
THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE
WITH THE OFFERS RIGHT NOW
IS WE DON'T DO DEBT.
WE HAVE NO DEBT
ON THE COMPANY TODAY.
WE WANT TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.
YOU'RE NOT A COMPANY.
SEE, THEN, HE DOESN'T BELIEVE,
RIGHT?
LOOK, IF YOU
BELIEVE IN THE COMPANY --
WELL, THEN,
YOU DO IT, MARK.
NO, LOOK,
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE COMPANY,
THEN YOU WANT THEM
TO RE-INVEST IN THE COMPANY.
THEN YOU SHOULD
WRITE A CHECK.
I LOVE A GUY
THAT'S WILLING TO GIVE ADVICE,
BUT HE WON'T WRITE A CHECK,
ALL RIGHT?
I'M WILLING TO WRITE A CHECK.
DO YOU WANT TO DO A DEAL OR NOT?
Don: SO, WE KNOW WE WALKED AWAY
FROM SOME MONEY TODAY,
BUT LIKE MARK SAID,
WE HAVE REALLY HIGH MARGINS.
IF WE GO OUT
AND WE CONTINUE TO DO
WHAT WE'RE DOING,
WE'RE GONNA GET THERE.
IT MAY JUST TAKE US
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,
BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE
THIS THING HAPPEN.
