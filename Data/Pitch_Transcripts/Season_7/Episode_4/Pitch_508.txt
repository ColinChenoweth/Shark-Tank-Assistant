HELLO, SHARKS,
MY NAME IS BRIAN KLEINSCHMIDT,
AND I'M A DAD-TREPRENEUR
FROM TAMPA, FLORIDA.
I'M HERE TO SECURE $50,000
FOR 15% OF MY DREAM.
MY COMPANY IS EZ-PEE-Z,
AND I'M CONFIDENT MY PRODUCT
IS GONNA FLIP YOUR LID.
ONE OF MY FIRST EXPERIENCES
AS A STEPDAD
WAS THE INEVITABLE
POTTY-TRAINING PHASE.
PERFECT TIMING, RIGHT?
I WAS SHOCKED
AND DISGUSTED TO SEE
THAT THE SAME TYPE
OF FOAM DOUGHNUT
THAT I WAS POTTY TRAINED ON
30 YEARS EARLIER
WAS STILL BEING USED.
I THINK YOU'LL AGREE
IT'S TIME WE PUT OUR TOILETS
ON A DOUGHNUT-FREE DIET.
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO EZ-PEE-Z.
THIS PRODUCT IS GONNA CHANGE
THE WAY THE WORLD POTTY TRAINS.
NOT ONLY IS IT EASY
FOR THE KIDS,
IT'S ALSO EASY FOR THE PARENTS.
AT FIRST,
IT APPEARS AND OPERATES
AS A NORMAL,
ADULT-SIZED TOILET SEAT,
BUT WITH A SIMPLE FLIP
OF THE LID...
POTTY TRAINING CAN BE
AS EASY AS ONE, TWO...
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ LAUGHS ]
BRIAN,
WHEN YOU FLIP THE LID...
YES, SIR.
...THAT EDGE
COULD PINCH THE SKIN,
WHICH WOULD NOT
HELP WITH --
IT ACTUALLY WON'T PINCH.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT
WITH THE 3-D PRINT.
THERE ARE SOME...
SOME -- SOME HINDRANCES
THAT 3-D PRINTING CANNOT DO,
SUCH AS A LIVING HINGE.
THIS IS CURRENTLY
IN THE PROTOTYPE PHASE.
THE WAY IT'LL BE
ONCE IT GOES TO MANUFACTURING,
IT'LL BE SEAMLESS ON TOP. THERE
WON'T BE ANYTHING YOU CAN SEE.
BUT I ASKED THE QUESTION
BECAUSE THE DOUGHNUT --
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LIFT IT?
THE DOUGHNUT
THAT YOU JUST THREW OUT,
IT'S COMFORTABLE
TO SIT ON THAT.
WELL, IT'S PADDED.
IT'S PADDED,
AND THIS IS NOT PADDED.
BUT THE GREAT THING IS, THIS IS
NOT JUST FOR POTTY TRAINING.
THIS INTRODUCES THE CHILD
TO SITTING ON AN ACTUAL TOILET.
CHILDREN NEED A SMALLER SEAT
UP UNTIL THEY'RE 6 YEARS OLD.
I HAVE A 6-YEAR-OLD
RIGHT NOW.
SHE'S TALL AND SKINNY.
SHE DOESN'T USE
THE FOAM DOUGHNUT.
SHE STILL NEEDS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
OR SHE IS GONNA FALL
IN THE TOILET.
BRIAN, ACTUALLY,
I HAVE ANOTHER CONCERN WITH IT.
IF I UNDERSTAND
THE IDEA PROPERLY...
MM-HMM.
...FOR ME TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT,
I'D HAVE TO TAKE IT HOME
AND REPLACE
MY EXISTING TOILET-SEAT COVER.
HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO
CHANGE THEIR TOILET SEAT?
IT'S -- IT'S -- IT'S -- IT'S --
IT'S TWO -- IT'S TWO SCREWS.
SO, RIGHT NOW,
LOOKING AT THIS, YOU HAVEN'T --
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ANY YET.
YOU ARE IN
THE PROTOTYPE STAGE.
CURRENTLY,
IT'S IN THE PROTOTYPE PHASE.
YES, MA'AM.
TELL US
YOUR BACKGROUND.
WELL, I MEAN,
MY BACKGROUND IS PROBABLY
A COMBINATION
OF THE FIVE OF YOU.
I GREW UP
AS A LITTLE MARK CUBAN.
I KNOW YOU WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR,
SELLING GARBAGE BAGS.
[ LAUGHS ]
RIGHT.
MY BROTHER AND I LITERALLY
WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD,
WASHING CARS.
SO, WE WOULD'VE BEEN
BEST FRIENDS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
OR DIRECT COMPETITION.
I JUST GOT DONE READING
YOUR BOOK, ROBERT,
AND WE HAD THE SAME DADS.
MINE DIDN'T SWEEP A WAREHOUSE,
BUT MINE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY
TO MAKE SURE WE HAD
EVERYTHING THAT WE NEEDED,
KEVIN, WHICH IS
A LOT LIKE YOUR --
YOU KNOW,
YOU BEING A DAD RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, WE GOT YOU
FROM 10 TO 12.
YEAH.
[ CORCORAN LAUGHS ]
13 ON.
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO, SALES AND MARKETING IS
WHAT I DID RIGHT AFTER COLLEGE.
GOT MARRIED, SETTLED DOWN
IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE,
AND STARTED FLIPPING HOUSES.
I SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY
THAT I DID THREE HOMES AT ONCE.
I DID IT IN 2008, WHICH,
AS YOU GUYS KNOW,
WAS PROBABLY
THE WORST TIME TO DO IT.
I LOST ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE PENNY I HAD.
MY WIFE AT THE TIME
DECIDED SHE WANTED
TO GO TO GREENER PASTURES.
I NEVER KNEW HOW MUCH I GAINED
BY LOSING ALMOST EVERYTHING.
BUT I MOVED BACK HOME
TO MY HOMETOWN OF TAMPA,
WHERE I STARTED
MY OWN GYM BUSINESS.
I WENT ALL-IN
ON MY FIRST ONE.
OVER THOSE FOUR YEARS,
I SAVED UP 200 GRAND,
EXPANDED FROM TWO GYMS
TO THREE GYMS,
AND I HAVE THREE OF THE MOST
SUCCESSFUL GYMS IN MY FRANCHISE.
SOMETHING'S
NOT ADDING UP.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN WORKING ON THIS?
THE INITIAL CONCEPT
WAS DEVELOPED SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
OKAY, SO,
THE INITIAL CONCEPT.
YOU GET
YOUR GYMS WORKING.
YEAH.
IT'S A
WELL-OILED MACHINE.
KNOWING YOU HAD
ALL THIS TIME,
THE BEST YOU COULD DO
IS A 3-D-PRINTED VERSION OF IT.
IF YOU WERE SO COMMITTED
AND THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT IDEA,
WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS
JUST RUNNING AND HUMMING?
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT I HAD ALL THE I.P. DONE,
GET EVERYTHING TRADEMARKED.
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
I MADE ALL THE RIGHT DECISIONS
SO I DIDN'T LOSE ALL MY MONEY
FLIPPING THREE HOUSES AGAIN.
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
I'M NOT BUYING IT. I'M OUT.
Corcoran:
BRIAN, HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET.
YES.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A BIG DEAL
TO REMOVE THAT NICE,
LITTLE CUSHION PAD FOR YOUR KID,
PUT IT UP AND DOWN,
WASH IT IN THE TUB.
IT'S SO EASY.
IT'S A PAIN.
I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME
YOU POTTY TRAINED.
A PAIN?
YEAH, NINE YEARS AGO.
YEAH, IT TURNS INTO
A NIGHTMARE.
IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE.
PLUS, IT'S A VISUAL EYESORE.
I MEAN, JUST -- JUST IMAGINE --
"A VISUAL EYESORE"?
WHEN YOU HAVE COMPANY
COME OVER, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T WANT GUESTS
TO SEE THE DOUGHNUT,
OR YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THE --
BRIAN, I DON'T BUY INTO IT.
I JUST DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK. I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS FOR LISTENING.
Herjavec: BRIAN.
YES, SIR?
YOU ARE
A GOOD SALESMAN.
THANKS.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A POINT
WHERE IT KIND OF
BECOMES TRANSPARENT.
I MEAN, I APPRECIATE THE FACT
THAT YOU DID THE RESEARCH,
AND I LOVE HOW
YOU CONNECTED THE STORIES,
BUT JUST AS A GENERAL TIP
IN SALES,
THERE'S A POINT THAT YOU CROSS,
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
YOU KIND OF JUST CROSSED
THAT POINT -- TOO MUCH SELLING.
I APOLOGIZE
IF I CAME ACROSS THAT WAY.
I'M -- I'M -- I'M --
I'M S--
YEAH, NO, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.
JUST --
JUST MY OBSERVATION.
I'M BEYOND EXCITED
TO BE HERE,
AND IT'S PROBABLY
MY EXCITEMENT COMING THROUGH.
I-I GOT IT, BUT I GOT TO BELIEVE
IN THE PRODUCT.
MM-HMM.
AND IN THIS CASE,
THE IDEA THAT CONSUMERS
ARE GONNA BUY THIS
AND REPLACE
AN EXISTING PRODUCT THAT WORKS,
I-I DON'T BUY THAT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY, I-I APPRECIATE THE TIME
AND YOU LISTENING,
AND THANKS
FOR THE ADVICE.
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST,
IT APPEARED TO ME VERY CLEVER,
LIKE A BETTER MOUSETRAP,
BUT YOU HAVE NO PROOF OF CONCEPT
WHATSOEVER.
BEFORE -- BEFORE YOU --
I DON'T KNOW IF --
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE SHOWED YOU THAT --
MY MOM WOULD BE
VERY UPSET WITH ME
'CAUSE SHE USED TO TELL ME
ALWAYS TO LOWER THE LID
'CAUSE WE HAD A DOG
THAT DRANK OUT OF THE TOILET.
SO, WE DO HAVE A FULL U.S.
UTILITY PATENT ON THE PRODUCT.
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, LORD.
SO, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES
A DIFFERENCE TO EACH OF YOU.
IT'S GREAT
YOU GOT A PATENT.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE ACHIEVE,
AND I COMMEND YOU.
DOES THAT CHANGE
YOUR INVESTMENT DECISION?
AND I THINK THAT THIS
HAS POTENTIAL.
BUT I'M OUT.
I APPRECIATE IT.
Cuban:
YOU HAVE ONE SHARK LEFT.
KEVIN?
IN THIS CASE, ALL TOILETS LEAD
BACK TO MR. WONDERFUL.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO, HERE, WE HAVE A SITUATION
WHERE THIS HAS NO MERIT.
THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THIS,
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS
YOU HAVEN'T
GONE INTO PRODUCTION YET,
SO YOU CAN TAKE THIS
BEHIND THE BARN AND SHOOT IT.
WHY SPEND YOUR TIME
DOING SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE
ANY PROBLEM?
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
WELL, 'CAUSE
I'M JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.
I HAVE AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ITCH
IN ME, AND I --
NO, NO,
BUT DOESN'T MEAN YOU --
I HAVE CREATIVITY JUST GOING
THROUGH MY MIND.
COME UP WITH
SOMETHING ELSE!
WHEN YOU WERE
STARTING YOUR COMPANY,
AND YOU ASKED YOUR MOM FOR A
$10,000 LOAN TO START SoftKey --
AND SHE <i>GAVE</i> IT
TO YOU?!
SO, YOU GOT A $10,000 LOAN
TO START SOFTKEY...
THAT'S RIGHT.
...SO SHE BELIEVED IN YOU.
I'M LOOKING FOR YOU
TO BELIEVE IN ME.
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T ABOUT A TOILET SEAT,
AND I THINK...
[ LAUGHTER ]
...HAD SHE LOOKED AT THIS,
SHE WOULD'VE SAID,
"I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU ANY
MONEY 'CAUSE IT'S A BAD IDEA."
BRIAN, LET'S CLOSE THE LID
ON THIS.
I'M OUT.
GOOD LUCK, MY FRIEND.
GOOD LUCK, BRIAN.
THIS IS A DOG.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Greiner: GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.
Herjavec: IT'S HIS ONLY
PROTOTYPE, KEVIN. BE CAREFUL.
Greiner: SIT ON IT, KEVIN.
[ Laughing ] WHAT ARE YOU
CHECKING OUT, KEVIN?
I CAN FEEL THE HINGE.
BUT --
YOU CAN FEEL THE HINGE?
I CAN DEFINITELY
FEEL THE HINGE.
Kleinschmidt:
I LOOK AT THIS JUST AS A
SPEED BUMP ON THE ROAD OF LIFE.
I-I WILL GO FORWARD,
AND, UM, I WILL PROSPER.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES
FROM ROBERT'S BOOKS WAS,
"TOUGH TIMES NEVER LAST.
TOUGH PEOPLE ALWAYS DO,"
AND I'M TOUGH.
