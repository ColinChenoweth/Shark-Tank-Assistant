MY NAME IS THOMAS CUCCO,
I'M FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK,
AND I OWN TABLE 87 PIZZA.
WHO WANTS A FRESH SLICE
OF COAL-OVEN PIZZA?
I OFFER MY CUSTOMERS
THE FRESHEST, HIGHEST-QUALITY
PIZZA ON THE MARKET.
WE USE ONLY
THE BEST INGREDIENTS --
FRESH MOZZARELLA, FRESH BASIL,
TOMATOES IMPORTED FROM ITALY,
AND, OF COURSE,
OUR UNIQUE, THIN-CRUST DOUGH
THAT CHARS IN OUR
900-DEGREE COAL-FIRED OVEN.
TAKE ONE BITE, AND YOU'LL KNOW
THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTION.
FUHGEDDABOUDIT.
PACO, WE NEED
ANOTHER PIE.
BORN AND RAISED IN BROOKLYN,
NEW YORK. I LOVE PIZZA.
I OPENED UP MY FIRST SHOP
HERE ON ATLANTIC AVENUE IN 2012.
WE GOT SO POPULAR, I HAD TO
OPEN UP A SECOND LOCATION,
AND THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME.
IF MY CUSTOMERS
LOVE MY PIZZA THAT MUCH,
I HAD TO FIGURE A WAY TO GET
MY PIZZA TO EVERYONE EVERYWHERE.
SAUCE IS READY?
BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH.
I NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
TO PURCHASE MORE EQUIPMENT
AND TO STREAMLINE MY OPERATION.
I HAVE BIG PLANS
FOR THIS BUSINESS,
AND I HOPE ONE DAY
TO PASS THIS ON TO MY CHILDREN,
WHERE THEY CAN CARRY ON THIS
LEGACY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.
I THINK THE SHARKS ARE GONNA
LOVE OUR PIZZA.
ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT, MAKING
THIS DEAL IS A NO-BRAINER.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS THOMAS CUCCO,
AND I'M FROM BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
MY COMPANY IS TABLE 87
FROZEN COAL OVEN PIZZA,
HOME OF THE COAL-OVEN SLICE.
I AM HERE SEEKING $200,000
FOR 10% OF EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
HEY, SHARKS, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE FROZEN-PIZZA GAME?
YES.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE ABLE TO BUY
FROZEN, COAL-OVEN PIZZA
BY THE SLICE OR PIE?
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHEN --
NEVER, UNTIL NOW.
[ CORCORAN LAUGHS ]
HEY, MARCO, LET'S SHOW THEM
THE WAY THIS UNIQUE EAST COAST
DOUGH WORKS.
-THAT'S MINE, THOMAS?
-THANK YOU.
-YOU GOT IT, BARBARA.
-YUMMY!
-OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT IS A --
THAT IS A NEW YORK-STYLE...
-MMM!
-THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
...BROOKLYN, COAL-OVEN SLICE.
-FRESH, HUH?
-OH, MY GOD!
THAT'S GOOD PIE.
THIS IS EXCELLENT.
THAT COMES OFF
OUR 20-INCH PIE,
AND THAT'S THE SLICE
WE PACKAGE
AND SELL TO THE --
TO THE SUPERMARKETS.
YOU'RE BASICALLY FLASH-FREEZING
PIZZA YOU MAKE, RIGHT?
YES.
AND SO THEN YOU ARE
SELLING IT TO DISTRIBUTORS
TO PUT IT IN
RETAIL FREEZERS, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
THAT'S A TOUGH BUSINESS.
PIZZA IS A COMMODITY.
YES, IT IS.
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PLAYERS,
LARGE AND SMALL,
IN THE FROZEN-PIZZA
BUSINESS.
TELL ME WHY YOU ARE GOING TO BE
DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE.
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT YOU WERE
NEVER REALLY ABLE TO GET
A REALLY QUALITY PIE FROZEN.
I DECIDED WHEN I OPENED
MY COAL OVEN SHOPS
THAT I WAS GONNA CHANGE
ALL THAT.
I THEN STARTED TO DEVELOP
PACKAGING WHERE I WAS ABLE
TO FLASH-FREEZE MY PIZZA AND
GET IT INTO THE SUPERMARKETS.
ARE YOU IN
THE SUPERMARKETS?
WE ARE IN 250 SUPERMARKETS,
SOME OF THEM BEING
WHOLE FOODS MARKET...
WOW.
...FAIRWAY MARKET.
Herjavec:
AND WHAT DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
THE PIE SELLS TO THE MARKET
FOR $6.50.
THE SUGGESTED RETAIL
IS $9.99 ON THE PIE.
THE SLICE SELLS
TO THE MARKET AT $3.
SUGGESTED RETAIL IS $4.99.
AND HOW IS IT SELLING?
WHAT ARE THE SELLS LIKE?
WE STARTED THE BUSINESS
NINE MONTHS AGO
ON THE FROZEN END OF IT.
MY TOTAL SALES
HAS BEEN $260,000.
AND WHERE DO YOU MAKE
THE PIES?
WE ARE CURRENTLY
MAKING THE PIES
IN OUR BRICK-AND-MORTARS
RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S A PROBLEM.
WHY IS THAT?
YOU WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT?
YOU WANT TO
SCALE THIS BUSINESS,
YOU NEED A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN
WITH THE SAME QUALITY.
YEAH, AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
THE $200,000 WOULD BE USED
FOR OVENS.
THOMAS, ARE YOU OFFERING US
A PIECE OF YOUR WHOLE BUSINESS,
OR IS IT SIMPLY
THIS OPERATION?
I'M OFFERING
10% OF MY FROZEN COMPANY.
ONLY -- BUT --
NOT THE RESTAURANTS?
NOT THE BRICK-AND-MORTARS.
BUT YOUR RESTAURANT BUSINESS
IS PICKING UP
A LOT OF THE EXPENSE.
YOU'RE USING THOSE OVENS.
YOU'RE USING
THE SIMILAR PERSONNEL,
IF NOT THE SAME PEOPLE.
HOW DO WE KNOW
WHAT PART OF THE PIE IS OURS
AND HOW MUCH IS YOURS?
IN ORDER -- IN ORDER TO REALLY
START SCALING THIS COMPANY,
WE NEED TO GET THIS THING
UNDER ONE ROOF.
TOTALLY SEPARATE?
TOTALLY SEPARATE.
WE NEED TO PUT IT UNDER --
IT'S GOT TO BE ITS OWN ENTITY
AT THIS POINT.
THOMAS, DO YOU KNOW WHY
THE BIG BRANDS LIKE DOMINO'S
DON'T GO INTO
THE FROZEN-PIZZA SECTION?
'CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
NO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO. NO, THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THEY'RE -- THEY'RE THE LARGEST
PIZZA PLAYER ON EARTH.
SO, THE COST OF MAINTAINING,
ON A SCALED BASIS,
SOME FOOTAGE
INSIDE A FREEZER
IN A BIG-BOX RETAILER
IS REALLY HIGH.
EXPENSIVE.
I HAVEN'T HAD A PROBLEM YET.
I NEVER PAID ONE SLOTTING FEE.
I'VE NEVER BEEN ASKED FOR --
'CAUSE YOU'RE SMALL!
YOU'RE LOCAL,
YOU'RE SMALL, AND --
YOU'RE SMALL.
AND WE ARE SMALL.
BUT LISTEN, FOR A NEW YORKER
TO BUY PIZZA PACKAGED FROZEN,
THE WAY THEY'RE BUYING
OUR PRODUCT,
IT SAYS A LOT
FOR OUR PRODUCT.
BUT LET'S -- YO, YO, YO, YO,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS, RIGHT?
WHAT DOES IT TAKE --
I TAKE THIS BACK.
CAN I POP IT
IN A MICROWAVE?
IT'S A
FULLY-COOKED PRODUCT.
YOU COULD TAKE THIS OUT
AND LEAVE IT ON YOUR DESK,
AND IN 20 MINUTES, IT'LL BE
WARM ENOUGH TO START EATING IT.
RIGHT.
IT'S FULLY COOKED.
YOU'RE NOT COOKING IT.
RIGHT,
YOU'RE JUST HEATING IT.
YOU'RE JUST HEATING IT
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
IT'S A HEAT-AND-SERVE ITEM.
SEE, TO ME,
THAT'S THE UPSIDE, RIGHT?
WE'RE GOING INTO
AN ON-DEMAND ECONOMY, RIGHT?
OF COURSE.
WHERE PEOPLE
WANT THINGS WHEN THEY WANT,
HOW THEY WANT...
RIGHT AWAY.
...WITH THE MOST
CONVENIENCE, RIGHT?
JUST TAKE THESE
AND JUST CRANK 'EM OUT.
THROW THEM IN
THE MICROWAVE -- $4.99.
I SEE A BUSINESS THERE.
DO YOU SELL ANYTHING
ONLINE AND SHIP?
WE HAVE AN ONLINE --
WE HAVE OUR ONLINE LAUNCHING
IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS
FROM NOW.
WE ARE IN GOOD EGGS. WE ARE
LAUNCHING WITH FRESH DIRECT.
AMAZON FRESH HAS
A BIG INTEREST IN US.
THAT'S THE GOLD MINE.
OKAY, SO, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
FORGET THE STORES!
BE THE GODFATHER OF THIS
ON-DEMAND DELIVERY IN PIZZA.
RIGHT.
TRYING TO GET INTO
ALL THESE STORES
IN THE FROZEN-FOOD SECTION
IS A BEAR.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE --
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
Herjavec: THOMAS, LOOK --
I EAT A LOT OF PIZZA.
IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY HEALTHY FOOD.
UM...BRUTAL,
BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE MARKET.
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO BE
A BIG FISH IN A LITTLE POND.
I THINK FOR YOU
TO TAKE AN INVESTMENT
AND TRY TO GO AFTER
THAT MAJOR...
SPACE IS GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT.
ROBERT, WE WANT TO EXPAND.
THE REASON WE NEED
THESE FOUR OVENS NOW
IS TO SET UP POSSIBLY 5,000,
10,000 BARS IN NEW YORK CITY.
I MEAN, IT'S ENDLESS
WHAT WE COULD DO
ON THE HEAT-AND-SERVE END.
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
THE SUPERMARKETS.
SUPERMARKETS ARE A GREAT PLACE
TO BE IN.
I UNDERSTAND
IT'S VERY COMPETITIVE.
BUT THE BARS, THE ARENAS --
THEY'RE IN THERE HAVING A BEER.
THEY WANT IT RIGHT NOW.
I JUST SEE THAT
AS TOO RISKY.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
THOMAS, I GOT TO TELL YOU --
IT'S SO GOOD,
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
THE IDEA'S WORTH $2 MILLION.
I'M GONNA WAIT.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE.
OH, NOW YOU'RE STEALING
ALL MY LINES.
I'M SORRY.
[ CHUCKLES ]
HE CERTAINLY IS.
-THAT IS MARK'S LINE.
-YEAH.
-LET ME FILL IN THE BLANKS HERE.
WELL, TOO BAD.
IT'S MY LINE NOW.
[ LAUGHS ]
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THIS BUSINESS.
YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL,
THE REAL PERSONALITY.
EVERYBODY'S
RESPONDING TO YOU.
WHO WOULD LOVE TO HANG OUT
IN YOUR KITCHEN?
ALL OF US, RIGHT?
THERE YOU GO.
YEAH.
I HAPPEN TO THINK
THAT YOU'RE GOING IN
A COUPLE OF DIRECTIONS AT ONCE,
AND SOME OF THEM
AREN'T SO WISE.
UH-HUH.
I DON'T EVEN THINK
YOU'RE GONNA DO SO WELL
SELLING ONLINE
BECAUSE THERE'S --
YOU DON'T THINK SO?
YEAH. LET'S SAY
THAT WE DID A DEAL TOGETHER.
YEAH.
YOU HAVE TO COMMIT
THAT YOU'RE ONLY GONNA SELL
SINGLE SLICES.
THAT'S YOUR SWEET SPOT HERE.
THAT IS. THAT IS. THAT IS
A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH WE HAVE,
I THINK,
IS THE SINGLE SLICE.
BUT HERE'S STILL
WHAT BOTHERS ME.
HOW DO I KNOW WHAT'S MINE
AND WHAT'S YOURS?
I MEAN, YOU -- YOU --
YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN IDEA
IN A MINUTE --
"HEY, NOT ONLY THAT,
I'M GONNA DO THIS,
AND NOT ONLY THAT."
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BARS.
IS THAT MY BUSINESS?
IS THAT YOUR BUSINESS?
IS THAT
YOUR PIZZA BUSINESS?
NO, THAT -- THAT WOULD BE
A PART OF THE FROZEN BUSINESS.
I THINK ANYTHING WE DO
UNDER THE FROZEN ROOF
WOULD BE A PART OF --
PART OF THE BUSINESS.
IT'S ALL FROZEN?
EXACTLY.
MY BRICK-AND-MORTARS
ARE THERE
STRICTLY TO BUILD UP
THIS PRODUCT, BUILD THE BRAND.
YEAH.
PEOPLE COME IN, THEY GET A SLICE
OFF THE COUNTER.
THEY KNOW THEY CAN BUY US
IN THE SUPERMARKET.
BARBARA,
ARE YOU MAKING AN OFFER?
YEAH,
I'LL MAKE AN OFFER,
BUT I WANT A LOT MORE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.
OH!
Narrator: ONE SHARK IS OUT.
BARBARA LIKES
THOMAS' FROZEN-PIZZA COMPANY,
TABLE 87 PIZZA,
BUT SHE WANTS A BIGGER SLICE
THAN THE 10%
HE CAME IN OFFERING.
I'LL MAKE AN OFFER, BUT I WANT
A LOT MORE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
AS ADORABLE AS YOU ARE,
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000 FOR 30%.
OH!
OUCH.
-SHE'S NOT SO ADORABLE NOW.
-HE'S GOT A BABY BUSINESS.
-YEAH, OUCH.
WOW, SHE TOOK A WHOLE SLICE
OUT OF YOUR PIE.
[ Laughing ]
A WHOLE SLICE.
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I THOUGHT --
BUT I CAN MAKE YOUR PIE
A LOT BIGGER --
A LOT BIGGER, FASTER.
I'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING
FOR YOU.
I'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING
JUST 'CAUSE I LIKE
TO MESS WITH BARBARA
A LITTLE BIT
AND GIVE YOU
OTHER OPTIONS.
UM...I DON'T THINK
IT IS POSSIBLE
TO SEPARATE THE BUSINESSES
OR YOU FROM IT...
I DON'T EITHER.
...BECAUSE YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL,
AND I FEEL YOUR ENERGY,
AND ONE OF THE REASONS
I'M LOVING THE PIE IS THE STORY,
ALL OF THAT AROUND IT.
YOU'RE THE GUY, OKAY?
YOU NEED CAPITAL.
SO, I HAVE A DEAL
THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THIS
CALLED
WICKED GOOD CUPCAKES,
WHERE I OWN
NO EQUITY, ZERO.
RIGHT.
NOTHING.
IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS,
AND IT'S GROWING LIKE HELL.
THEY PAID ME BACK
THROUGH A ROYALTY, ALL RIGHT?
IF YOU WANT TO
GO INTO A DEAL LIKE THAT,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000,
AND ONLY ON THE FROZEN,
YOU PAY ME BACK A LITTLE BIT
EVERY SLICE.
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000.
WHAT CAN YOU AFFORD
TO PAY ME PER SLICE?
WELL, IF I DID A ROYALTY,
IF I DECIDED TO DO A ROYALTY,
I COULD PROBABLY PAY 25 CENTS
ON A SLICE.
OKAY, SO LET'S SAY
IT'S 25 CENTS.
AFTER I GET BACK --
BACK $600,000, WE'RE DONE.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
WOW.
I HELPED YOU BUILD IT.
WE'RE PARTNERS.
IF YOU STILL LOVE ME AFTER THAT,
YOU KEEP ME ON BOARD.
IT'S YOUR DECISION.
THAT'S CALLED A LOAN SHARK.
I WOULD DO THE TRADE THIS --
I COULD PROBABLY GET THAT MONEY
ON 18th AVENUE.
[ LAUGHS ]
YEAH, BUT YOU WOULDN'T --
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ME.
IT SAVES SOME MONEY.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ME,
AND I THINK TWO GUYS
WITH HAIRCUTS LIKE THIS
CAN GO A LONG WAY, BUDDY.
I THINK WE COULD.
I THINK WE COULD.
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.
-ALL RIGHT.
-I THINK YOU SHOULD.
-I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.
-I THINK YOU SHOULD.
I WOULD NOT GIVE UP
30% OF YOUR BUSINESS
TO ANY OF THESE SHARKS.
THAT'S TOO GREEDY.
WELL, MAYBE LORI HAS
AN OFFER, THOMAS.
HI, LORI.
I HAVE AN OFFER, THOMAS,
BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER
YOU CAN'T REFUSE.
MY OFFER'S GOING TO BE --
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $250,000...
Herjavec: WHOA.
...FOR 20%...
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY
IN THE BEGINNING TO RAMP UP.
I ALSO HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH ALL THE NATURAL-FOOD CHAINS
OUT THERE.
I LIKE THE SLICE, BUT
I ALSO LIKE SELLING THE PIE.
I THINK THERE'S A MARKET
FOR BOTH.
BUT I ALSO LIKE YOUR IDEA
OF ALSO GETTING IT OUT THERE
INTO BARS
AND OTHER PLACES.
IN THE VENUES.
I BELIEVE WHY NOT?
IF YOU HAVE THE MANPOWER
AND THE BRAINPOWER
AND YOU PLAN IT OUT
CORRECTLY...
THAT'S RIGHT.
...YOU CAN HIT
ALL PLACES.
EXACTLY.
WOW, THOMAS.
SO, I REALLY
WANT IN.
I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Herjavec:
WOW, SHE GAVE YOU MORE THAN
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.
SHE DID.
MARK, WHAT ARE YOU?
ARE YOU IN?
MARK, WE ARE LAUNCHING OUR
GLUTEN-FREE PRODUCT THIS FALL,
ALONG WITH
TWO OTHER PRODUCTS.
IT'S GONNA BE
THE MUSHROOM WHITE TRUFFLE OIL
AND THE
PROSCIUTTO-LACED PIE.
WOW.
THOSE ARE OUR TWO TOP SELLERS
IN THE STORE.
THIS YEAR, WE'RE GONNA BRING
$3 MILLION INTO TWO STORES.
NOT BAD.
YOU KNOW, I LOVE THE IDEA,
EXCEPT FOR THE STORES.
OKAY.
I HATE THE IDEAS
OF THE STORES.
I THINK YOUR GOLD MINE
IS THROUGH ON-DEMAND.
CREATING
AN INFRASTRUCTURE
TO GO AND SELL AT RETAIL
IS DIFFICULT.
THOMAS, YOU'VE DONE PRETTY WELL
ON YOUR OWN.
SCALING THAT
IS DIFFICULT.
THE WHOLE
FRESH DIRECT SIDE,
I THINK THAT'S WHERE
YOU SHOULD STICK.
I'LL BE A CUSTOMER,
BUT I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT, THOMAS,
THERE IS -- THERE IS NO --
THOMAS, COME BACK.
COME BACK TO ME FOR A MINUTE.
THERE IS NO DOUGH
COMING FROM MARK.
I WANT YOU, THOMAS.
SHE WANTS YOU.
TAKE IT.
ONE QUESTION EACH.
AND MY OFFER IS
$250,000...
MM-HMM.
...20%, BUT YOU NEED
TO TELL ME NOW.
NO.
LORI, WOULD YOU
CONSIDER 18%?
NO.
I'D CONSIDER 19%.
18.5%.
NO, THOMAS, LISTEN TO ME.
I HAVE A BETTER DEAL HERE.
DONE!
DONE!
SUGAR! I SHOULD'VE
MOVED FASTER.
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO EXCITED!
I HATE LOSING TO LORI!
OH!
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME
TO THE STORE.
THOMAS, THIS IS --
I'M NOT JOKING YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE GOT IT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE THE BEST.
SHARKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Cuban:
CONGRATS, THOMAS.
MARK, WE'LL SEE YOU
IN BROOKLYN.
I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
THOMAS. I'M A SCORNED WOMAN.
WE DID IT, MARCO!
WE GOT IT A SHARK.
WE DID IT.
WE GOT 'EM.
Cucco:
I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.
I WALKED OUT OF "SHARK TANK"
WITH A DEAL.
NERVOUS WALKING IN
AND A JOYFUL WALKING OUT.
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
