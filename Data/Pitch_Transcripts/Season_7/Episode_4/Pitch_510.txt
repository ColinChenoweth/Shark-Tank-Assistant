Narrator: IN SEASON SIX,
ALICE BROOKS AND BETTINA CHEN
MADE A DEAL FOR ROOMINATE,
WHICH TEACHES BUILDING
AND ENGINEERING SKILLS
TO BOYS AND GIRLS.
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU $500,000
FOR 5%.
YES, YOU HAVE A DEAL.
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'RE
UP TO NOW.
Brooks: SINCE WE MADE OUR DEAL
ON "SHARK TANK,"
MARK'S PLAYED A HUGE ROLE
IN HELPING US EXPAND
OUR RETAIL PRESENCE.
WE CLOSED A MAJOR DEAL
WITH WALMART.
ROOMINATE IS NOW
BEING SOLD
IN 800 STORES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND ONLINE.
ARE YOU GUYS
ALL READY TO PLAY?
All: YEAH!
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
BECAUSE TODAY,
WE HAVE AN IN-STORE DEMO,
AND IT'S GONNA
GIVE KIDS A CHANCE
TO TRY ROOMINATE HANDS-ON.
WE'RE MAKING A HOUSE.
IT'S MORE OF A MANSION BECAUSE
IT'S PRETTY BIG.
YEAH.
Chen:
WITH OUR EXPANSION INTO RETAIL,
OUR SALES
HAVE REALLY SURGED.
BEFORE "SHARK TANK,"
OUR SALES WERE
$1.7 MILLION
IN A YEAR AND A HALF.
IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE
WE APPEARED ON "SHARK TANK,"
AND WE'VE DONE
OVER $4.5 MILLION IN SALES.
Brooks: AND THAT'S BEFORE
THE WALMART DEAL.
THIS DEAL ALONE COULD
INCREASE OUR SALES BY MILLIONS.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY OUT
LIGHT NUMBER ONE.
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT A YEAR AGO,
IT WAS JUST
THE TWO OF US.
NOW WE HAVE
EIGHT EMPLOYEES,
AND WE'VE MOVED INTO OUR
VERY OWN ROOMINATE HEADQUARTERS.
LET'S TURN IT ON NOW.
AH, YOU GUYS,
IT'S WORKING!
AND WE'VE INTRODUCED
AN EXCITING, NEW TECHNOLOGY
CALLED "R" POWER,
WHICH ALLOWS KIDS
TO PROGRAM AND CONTROL
THEIR CREATIONS
FROM THE BRAND-NEW
ROOMINATE APP.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
OUR MISSION
TO EMPOWER GIRLS
TO BECOME BUILDERS
AND MAYBE ONE DAY,
ENGINEERS.
BECAUSE OF MARK AND
"SHARK TANK," WE'VE BEEN ABLE
TO SPREAD OUR MESSAGE
AND GET OUR TOYS TO GIRLS
WHO WILL ONE DAY BUILD
OUR FUTURE.
All: ROOMINATE!
HI.
MY NAME IS JOVON ENGLISH.
I'M NAIMAH HARRIS.
I'M MARQUES BROOKS.
WE'RE FROM LOS ANGELES,
CALIFORNIA, AND WE ARE...
Together:
MILK AND BROOKIES.
WE ARE SEEKING $100,000
FOR 20% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
NEW YORK HAS THE CRONUT,
SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE CRUFFIN,
BUT L.A...
BABY, L.A. HAS
THE BROOKIE.
BROOKIES ARE
BROWNIE/COOKIE MASH-UPS.
IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD GET
IF A BROWNIE LIKED A COOKIE,
PUT A RING ON IT,
AND THEN HAD A BABY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HERE AT MILK + BROOKIES,
WE HAVE OVER EIGHT DIFFERENT
SPECIALTY BROOKIES,
INCLUDING THE O.G.,
WHICH IS A FUDGE BROWNIE
<i>AND</i> A CHOCOLATE-CHIP COOKIE.
THE O.G.
THIS IS
WHAT STARTED IT ALL.
OUR BUILD-A-BROOKIE MENU ALLOWS
BROOKIE MONSTERS, OUR FANS,
TO CREATE THEIR OWN
SPECIALTY BROOKIE.
WITH OVER
750 COMBINATIONS,
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD TIME
FOR MILK + BROOKIES.
ALWAYS.
SO, SHARKS, WE'RE ASKING
THAT YOU TAKE A BITE
AND JOIN
THE BROOKIE REVOLUTION.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
MARQUES IS GONNA
PASS YOU SAMPLES.
SHORT AND SWEET.
IT'S BROOKIE TIME!
WITH MILK, TOO.
HOW SWEET IS THAT?
-AND MILK?
-AND MILK.
-YES.
-YES.
-WOW.
-YUMMY.
-ABSOLUTELY.
AND YOU ALL HAVE
YOUR OWN SPECIAL MILK.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
AND, LORI, SOME MILK.
HERE'S THE MILK, BARB.
-NO, NO, THAT'S YOUR MILK.
-NO, LORI, THAT'S YOUR MILK.
-I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER.
-NO, THAT'S YOUR MILK.
GOD!
[ LAUGHTER ]
WOW!
THIS IS SO CONFUSING!
I KNOW!
IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS DIFFICULT!
THAT'S MY OWN MILK?
THAT'S YOURS.
THAT'S WHAT'S UP!
THAT'S YOURS.
WHAT IS THE CLASSIC ONE --
THE O.G.?
A FUDGE BROWNIE
AND A CHOCOLATE-CHIP COOKIE
WITH THREE TYPES OF CHIPS.
SO, YOU HAVE TO GET EVERYTHING
IN ONE BITE...
WOW.
...BROWNIE AND COOKIE...
-MMM, IT'S GOOD.
-MMM.
...TO GET THE FULL BROOKIE
EXPERIENCE.
THE BLONDIE AND WHAT?
AND A SNICKERDOODLE COOKIE.
SO, WE'VE RUN INTO
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT...
MMM.
...HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF AN AVERSION TO CHOCOLATE,
SO WE CREATED A BLONDIE.
MMM.
SO, IT'S WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS,
BUTTERSCOTCH,
AND HEATH
IN A BLOND BROWNIE.
I JUST TASTED IT.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
OH, THIS ONE IS
FANTASTIC.
THESE ARE -- THESE ARE
EXCEPTIONALLY RICH.
THANK YOU.
THEY'RE -- I WOULD SAY
THAT'S 400 TO 500 CALORIES
IN EACH ONE OF THESE.
HOW MANY CALORIES
IN EACH ONE?
DON'T ANSWER THAT.
DON'T TELL US.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, WE NEED TO KNOW.
WE NEED TO KNOW.
SO, WE ARE SENDING IT OFF
FOR TESTING FOR THE CALORIES.
DO YOU SELL THESE ONLINE?
WE DO SELL THEM ONLINE.
WE HAVE AN INTERNET-BASED
BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S HOW WE OPERATE.
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP,
THE THREE OF YOU?
THIS IS MY BEST FRIEND.
AND THIS IS
MY SISTER-FRIEND.
AND WE'RE ROOMMATES.
YEAH.
HOW DID YOU
ALL OF A SUDDEN DECIDE,
"LET'S MAKE SOME CUPCAKES?"
SO, INITIALLY, WE --
I MADE THE BROOKIES.
I TOOK THEM
TO A HOLIDAY PART.
EVERYBODY WANTED ME
TO MAKE SOME MORE.
THEY WANTED TO BUY SOME.
SO, INITIALLY, WE WANTED
TO JUST PAY THE CABLE BILL.
[ LAUGHS ]
"IF WE PAY THIS CABLE BILL,
THIS WILL BE GREAT."
REALLY?
SO, THEN IT'S LIKE, "WELL, LET'S
SEE IF WE CAN PAY THE RENT."
YOU KNOW, AND IT KIND OF GREW...
ORGANICALLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER
OF INVENTION, RIGHT?
-RIGHT?
-YES, YES.
-MY GOSH.
AND WHAT IS
YOUR BACKGROUNDS?
WELL, I COME FROM
THE WORLD OF FINANCE.
I WAS IN BANKING -- PRIVATE
BANKING AND RELATIONSHIP BANKING
FOR OVER 10 YEARS.
THAT'S MY WORLD.
THAT'S MY WORLD.
WELL, I GOT OUT OF IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND SO NOW I WORK WITH
A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION
THAT SUPPORTS THE HOMELESS,
THE MENTALLY ILL,
PEOPLE RECENTLY RELEASED
FROM INCARCERATION.
YOU'RE NOT FULL-TIME
IN BROOKIES?
NO, I'M NOT FULL-TIME
IN BROOKIES.
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS FULL-TIME?
NONE OF US.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO?
I WORK IN HEALTHCARE.
OKAY, AND, MARQUES?
I WORK IN REAL ESTATE,
BUT MORE SO, SPECIFICALLY,
I WORK IN PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.
SO, YOU GUYS ARE DOING THIS
WHENEVER YOU HAVE TIME.
WE -- WE MAKE TIME TO DO IT.
NO, WE DON'T SLEEP.
SO, LITERALLY,
WE'RE OPERATING ON NAPS.
YOU GUYS PROBABLY KNOW
WICKED GOOD CUPCAKES.
THAT'S ONE OF MY DEALS.
AND AS WE GREW, THEY STARTED
WORKING 18 HOURS A DAY.
I MEAN,
IT IS A FULL-TIME GIG.
AND THERE WERE TWO PARTNERS,
BY THE WAY.
SO, THE WAY IT WORKS, AFTER
WORK, WE COLLECT THE ORDERS.
EVERY ORDER MUST BE RECEIVED
BY 7:00 PACIFIC STANDARD TIME,
AND WE'RE ABLE
TO EITHER SHIP THEM
OR HAVE THEM DELIVERED
THE FOLLOWING DAY.
AND YOU SHIP THEM FRESH?
YES, WE BAKE EVERYTHING
TO ORDER.
Greiner:
YOU GO INTO THE KITCHEN,
AND YOU ACTUALLY STIR THE FOOD
AND MAKE IT YOURSELF?
-MM-HMM.
-YES.
-YES.
Herjavec: JOVON --
AND YET
YOU'RE CUSTOMIZING
EACH ORDER --
750 DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS?
YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T SCALE THAT.
WELL, HOW MUCH
HAVE YOU SOLD SO FAR?
SO, RIGHT NOW
IN TERMS OF SALES,
WE'VE SOLD
$14,000 WORTH OF BROOKIES.
IN THE CUPCAKE,
CONFECTIONERY GIFTING BUSINESS,
WHICH I THINK
IS WHAT BROOKIES IS...
MM-HMM.
...THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE SCALE
AND GROWING
IS TO STANDARDIZE
AROUND FOUR PRODUCTS.
RIGHT. OKAY.
THAT'S IT BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO KIND OF MANAGE
INVENTORY EXPECTATION.
YOU'RE SHIPPING FRESH,
YOU CAN'T HAVE 750 OPTIONS.
THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF HELL
IN CUPCAKE LAND.
RIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU CAN'T --
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
AND WHAT DO YOU
SELL SIX CUPCAKES FOR --
PARDON ME --
BROOKIES FOR?
WITHOUT NUTS,
THEY'RE SOLD FOR $14.
WITH NUTS,
THEY'RE SOLD FOR $17.
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT COSTS YOU TO MAKE?
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL BROOKIE
WITHOUT NUTS,
IT COSTS US 75 TO MAKE.
WITH NUTS,
IT COSTS US 91 CENTS.
ARE YOU SURE?
WAIT, IS THAT $14
FOR SIX OF THEM,
OR $14 FOR
THE ONE PER CAKE?
-$14 FOR SIX.
-FOR SIX.
-FOR SIX.
OOH, YOU'RE NOT CHARGING
NEAR ENOUGH.
IF YOU LOOK
AT THE CUPCAKE BUSINESS,
YOU HAVE TO SELL SIX
AT A TIME.
OKAY.
RIGHT?
AND YOU'VE GOT
TO GET $20 FOR IT.
FOR THESE, MORE THAN THAT
BECAUSE WHAT YOU GIVE,
OFFER NOW
IS A CUSTOMIZED SERVICE.
RIGHT.
PRODUCT IS AMAZING.
I MEAN,
YOU'VE GOT PROBABLY
THE BEST PRODUCT TASTER
AND TESTER IN THE WORLD THERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, MARQUES.
GO, MARQUES! GO, MARQUES!
GO, MARQUES!
HE'S THE LEADER
OF OUR DANCE TEAM.
RIGHT, HE IS.
BROOKIES ARE MADE
WITH LOVE.
IT SHOULD BE
$9.95 EACH.
NO, IT SHOULD BE $30 FOR SIX.
THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT.
OR $30 -- $30 FOR SIX.
YOUR CHOICE, RIGHT?
OKAY.
Harris: OKAY.
EVEN THOUGH YOUR SALES
IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF UNITS
MIGHT GO DOWN SOME,
YOUR PROFITS ARE GOING TO GO UP.
RIGHT.
MM.
BECAUSE YOUR BIGGEST LIMIT
IS YOUR TIME.
RIGHT.
MM-HMM.
THAT'S YOUR
MOST VALUABLE ASSET.
SO, YOU DON'T NEED
THE MOST NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS
IN THE WORLD.
YOU NEED TO MAXIMIZE
YOUR RETURN ON YOUR TIME.
BUT UNTIL THEN,
YOU'RE A BAKE SALE,
YOU'RE NOT A BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
SO, EVERYBODY'S REINVENTING
YOUR BUSINESS PLAN FOR YOU,
BUT LET'S CALL IT
WHAT IT IS.
YOU FORMED
A BAKING SOCIAL CLUB,
AND YOU CAME HERE
TO THE "SHARK TANK."
THERE IS NO C.E.O.
THERE'S NO EMPLOYEES.
THERE'S JUST YOU GUYS
BAKING CUPCAKES.
IT'S US.
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING.
YOU'RE A HOBBY,
YOU'RE NOT A BUSINESS.
I'M IN THIS SPACE.
UM, I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES
TO SUCCEED IN IT.
YOU DON'T HAVE IT YET.
I'M OUT.
DID I HEAR YOU SAY
THERE'S A DANCE TEAM?
NOT TODAY.
WHILE WE'RE
COOKING BROOKIES,
WE ARE DANCING
WITH THE MUSIC,
AND HE'S
THE LEADER OF OUR --
PLAYING BEYONCé.
PSEUDO-BEYONCé.
Herjavec:
OH, THERE WE GO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
HEY, THAT'S
HOW WE DO IT, MAN.
MARQUES,
LOVED THE PRODUCT.
THANK YOU.
EVERYBODY HERE LOVED
THE TASTE OF THE PRODUCT.
THANK YOU.
WHEN PRODUCTS SHOW UP
ON "SHARK TANK,"
ESPECIALLY FOOD PRODUCTS
THAT WE ALL LOVE...
THINGS BLOW UP.
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
WE'RE READY.
BUT YOU'RE A LITTLE EARLY.
I'M GONNA
SAY NO TO THE BROOKIE,
BUT CALL ME
FOR THE DANCE TEAM.
OKAY.
ABSOLUTELY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THE THREE OF YOU?
WHAT IS THAT?
YOUR PERSONALITY.
-OH, THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
USUALLY, YOU GET ONE GOOD
PERSONALITY AND TWO CLUNKERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHO'S THE CLUNKER,
BARBARA?!
IT'S THE TRUTH!
BUT YOU HAVE NO CLUNKERS HERE.
NO CLUNKERS?!
YOU'RE TRIPPING OVER EACH OTHER
WITH PERSONALITY,
AND SO IT'S CONTAGIOUS.
YOU JUST WANT TO JOIN
THAT PARTY,
BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY LIKE
DAISY CAKES,
WHO MADE
ALL THE WRONG MISTAKES
WHEN SHE AIRED
ON "SHARK TANK" NIGHT.
HER WEBSITE CRASHED.
IT WAS CRAZY.
SHE LOST OVER...
$350,000 IN SALES
IN ONE NIGHT.
WOW.
Harris: WOW.
IT WAS A HEARTBREAKER.
SHE WAS BAKING 100 --
I THINK IT WAS $112,000
WORTH OF CAKES WHEN SHE APPEARED
ON "SHARK TANK."
YOU'VE GOT...$14,000.
YOU'RE TOO EARLY.
I'M OUT.
-OKAY.
-OKAY.
-OKAY.
I SEE IT AS, LIKE, YOU'RE TRYING
TO SELL US A FOREST
WHILE RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE A LITTLE ACORN.
THE THING IS
YOU GUYS ARE VERY EARLY.
FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR ADVICE.
THANKS, GUYS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.
-CONGRATS, GUYS.
-THANK YOU.
-MARQUES?
-COME ON.
-ENJOY THE PROCESS.
-YEAH, DO IT.
Herjavec: COME ON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
COME ON.
TELL ME 'BOUT THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-SEE YOU, GUYS.
-THANK YOU. TAKE CARE.
-THANK YOU! BYE!
-BYE.
-BYE.
-BYE.
-THANK YOU.
Greiner: OKAY.
THEY WERE SO MUCH FUN.
OH, MY GOSH.
WE DID IT.
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.
WE'RE OKAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY SAW IT.
WE MADE IT.
THEY LOVED IT.
WE SURVIVED.
THIS IS
A REALLY GOOD IDEA.
ARE YOU DOING BEYONCé?
[ LAUGHS ]
