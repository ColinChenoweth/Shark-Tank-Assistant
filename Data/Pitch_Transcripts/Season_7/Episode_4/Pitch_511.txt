HI, SHARKS,
MY NAME'S SEAN RILEY,
AND I'M HERE
WITH MY GOOD FRIENDS,
RYAN MEEGAN AND JEFF KLIMKOWSKI,
AND WE'RE THE GUYS
OF DUDE PRODUCTS,
HAILING FROM CHICAGO,
ILLINOIS.
BUT YOU CAN JUST CALL US
"THE DUDES."
DUDE.
AND WE'RE HERE TODAY,
SEEKING $300,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10%
OF OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, ARE YOU STILL WIPING
THE OLD-FASHION WAY
WITH JUST TOILET PAPER?
IF SO...YOU'RE A CHUMP, AND YOUR
ASS PROBABLY HATES YOU FOR IT.
[ CORCORAN CHUCKLES ]
BUT, HEY, WHAT'S A DUDE TO DO?
YOU COULD TRY
SOME BABY WIPES.
BUT WE'RE NOT BABIES,
WE'RE DUDES!
SO WE CREATED
THE AWARD-WINNING DUDE WIPES.
THEY'RE THE VERY FIRST WIPES
FOR, WELL, DUDES.
THEY'RE FLUSHABLE,
BIODEGRADABLE,
HAVE SOOTHING ALOE, AND THE
ANSWER TO EVERY DUDE'S PRAYERS.
NOW, DUDES
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE
CAN USE DUDE WIPES
FROM BLUE-COLLAR DUDES
TO COLLEGE BROS
TO BUSINESS GUYS,
EVEN MOMS WITH LITTLE,
SMELLY DUDES.
I EVEN CAUGHT MY WIFE
STEALING DUDE WIPES.
AND DUDE WIPES AREN'T
JUST FOR TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS
ON THE THRONE.
THEY'RE ALSO SAFE
FOR YOUR FACE, PITS, HANDS,
AND THEY COMBAT STINK
FOR ALL DUDE REGIONS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, SHARKS, WHICH ONE OF YOU
ARE READY TO JOIN IN THE CRUSADE
OF SAVING THE WORLD...
Together:
ONE DUDE AT A TIME.
[ CHUCKLES ] ROBERT,
DON'T GO UP AND TRY THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, PLEASE DO, ROBERT.
LET'S SEE.
CAN WE SEE THEM?
-WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE TO CHECK
SOME OUT?
-YEAH.
-YEAH, LET'S SHOW THEM.
WE WILL HOOK YOU UP
WITH THE DUDE WIPES.
DUDE!
HERE YOU GO, ROBERT.
YOU CAN TAKE ONE OF
OUR SOFT PACKS.
DOES IT HAVE, LIKE,
DUDE COLOGNE SCENT?
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY FRAGRANCE-FREE
AND FRESH SCENTS.
OUR GOAL --
SO, THE ONE
MR. WONDERFUL'S HOLDING IS
A NATURAL
HEALTH-AND-BEAUTY PRODUCT.
THAT FITS ME.
I'M NATURAL AND BEAUTIFUL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, HERE'S A QUESTION
FOR YOU DUDES.
USUALLY,
WHEN I GO ANYWHERE,
THERE'S ALREADY TOILET PAPER
THERE FOR ME.
NOW I HAVE TO CARRY
THE DUDE WIPE WITH ME.
RIGHT.
WELL, DON'T YOU GET
THE DIFFERENCE?
NO. WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
-THAT'S THE COMPLEMENT
TO TOILET PAPER.
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-YOU FINISH IT OFF
WITH THE DUDE WIPE.
-OH, THIS IS THE FINISHING?
-OH.
-YEAH, IT'S THE --
-YEAH.
-OH, THIS IS THE FINISHER?
-RIGHT THERE.
WE CALL IT
THE SECOND-TO-LAST WIPE.
[ LAUGHS ]
SEE, WE WERE USING BABY WIPES
IN OUR APARTMENT IN CHICAGO.
THAT'S HOW WE GOT STARTED.
NO, DUDE!
-I DON'T BUY IT.
-100%.
-I KNOW --
I DON'T BUY IT.
NO, LISTEN,
WAIT, WAIT.
THREE GUYS LIVING TOGETHER
IN CHICAGO,
AND YOU'RE USING
BABY WIPES?
WELL, YEAH, WE WERE.
BUT I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THERE'S A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH THIS.
THE MINUTE I TOOK IT
OUT OF THE PACKAGE,
MY FINGER WENT
RIGHT THROUGH THAT.
IT'S TOO FRAGILE, AND...
IT'S TRAGIC, ACTUALLY.
...AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS
TOO SMALL FOR MY HUSBAND.
HE'S 6'1".
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
HE NEEDS SOMETHING
TWICE AS BIG AS THIS.
GOT A BIG BUTT?
[ LAUGHS ]
WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF FUN
WITH IT.
LET'S GET SERIOUS
ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY
BECAUSE YOU COULD
PROVE US ALL WRONG
AND OUR SKEPTICISM BY TELLING US
YOU HAVE LOTS OF SALES
BECAUSE YOU PUT A VALUATION
ON THIS BUSINESS OF $3 MILLION.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE SALES,
I'M GONNA WIPE
YOUR YOU-KNOW-WHAT WITH THIS.
SO, YEAR TO DATE,
WE HAVE $300,000,
BUT WE'RE PROJECTING
$1.5 MILLION FOR THIS YEAR.
WHY?
'CAUSE WE JUST LANDED
A $2- TO $3-MILLION CONTRACT
TO GO NATIONWIDE
WITH KROGER.
WOW!
KROGER'S PUTTING YOU IN?
DUDE WIPES ARE
GOING INTO KROGER?
WE'VE ALREADY TESTED
WITH THEM,
AND THIS IS A COMPLETE
NATIONAL ROLLOUT...
AH.
...IN THE
TOILET-PAPER AISLE,
WHICH IS
THE MOST CONSUMABLE AISLE.
SO, BASICALLY,
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS
WE'RE ROLLING OUT
IN 1,500 TO 2,200 STORES.
IT'S ABOUT $168,000
A MONTH.
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
$6.49 KROGER WILL BE SELLING
THAT GUY FOR.
WE MAKE ABOUT 40% MARGIN
IN STORES AND 60% MARGIN ONLINE.
SO, YOURS SELLS FOR $6.49.
WHAT DOES THE BABY WIPE --
SAME PACKAGE -- SELL FOR?
I JUST WANT TO DO
A COMPARISON.
PROBABLY HALF THE PRICE
FOR THE SAME SIZE.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH MY $300,000
IF I GIVE IT TO YOU?
WELL, WE'RE GONNA USE THAT
TO GO GET NEW BIG-BOX RETAILERS.
WE HAVE
THE WORKING CAPITAL.
WE HAVE
THE MONEY TO DO KROGER.
Herjavec: SO, JEFF, YOU'VE DONE
$300,000 IN SALES.
WHAT'S YOUR MARKETING SPEND?
WE SPEND 10% TO 15%
FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND,
SO WE REINVEST IN OUR --
SO YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY
YET, RIGHT?
WELL, NO, WE ARE 'CAUSE WE HAVE
40% GROSS MARGINS.
BUT ARE YOU
PAYING YOURSELVES ANYTHING?
UH, WE'RE PAYING SEAN.
I'M THE FULL-TIME SALARY TO GET
THE COMPANY GOING.
AND WHAT ARE
THE OTHER DUDES DOING?
SO, I'M AN
INVESTMENT BANKER, AND...
I WORK FOR MY DAD'S
MANUFACTURING COMPANY.
WHAT DO YOU MANUFACTURE?
ACTUALLY,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
LUXURY MOBILE RESTROOM TRAILERS
AND SHOWERS.
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD!
[ CHUCKLES ]
THAT'S RIGHT.
Cuban: GUYS, LOOK,
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I THINK YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL.
BUT I'VE GOT TWO PROBLEMS.
I JUST DON'T SEE ME AS
A WIPES KIND OF GUY. I'M SORRY.
SECOND, I THINK
YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING
THE AMOUNT OF MARKETING DOLLARS
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
TO REALLY OPEN UP
A NEW CATEGORY.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A RIDE
THAT I CAN TAKE,
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
APPRECIATE YOUR POINTS.
THANK YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK.
I HAVEN'T HAD MY HUSBAND STEP
FOOT IN A TOILET-PAPER AISLE
SINCE I MARRIED HIM.
MEN DON'T SHOP FOR TOILET PAPER
FOR THE MOST PART.
THEIR WIVES DO, SO I THINK
YOU HAVE TO SELL IT TO THE WIFE.
I'M NOT SURE
THEY'RE GONNA BUY IN,
ESPECIALLY
WITH THE ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE
THAT THE PRICE
ON THESE DUDE WIPES
ARE EXACTLY DOUBLE WHAT
THEY PAID FOR THE BABY WIPES.
ALSO, I PUNCHED
MY FINGER THROUGH IT
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING...
THAT SCARES ME.
...AND I CAN'T SHAKE THAT
OUT OF MY HEAD.
SO I WISH YOU LUCK,
BUT THEY'RE NOT FOR ME. I'M OUT.
Greiner:
I LOVE YOU, DUDES.
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
BUT YOU WANT $300,000
FOR 10%. WHY?
WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?
I KNOW YOU'RE GETTING INTO
KROGER, BUT...
YEAH. I MEAN, BASICALLY,
TWO TO THREE TIMES YOUR REVENUE,
AND I UNDERSTAND
WE'RE VERY EARLY...
REVENUE?
...AND ALL THAT
KIND OF STUFF.
'CAUSE YOU -- GUYS -- YOU KNOW
THIS. YOU'RE THE BANKER GUY.
YOU'RE WORTH
ABOUT A MILLION BUCKS TODAY.
YOU SAID $300,000 PRE-TAX,
ABOUT $230,000 AFTER TAX.
NO ONE'S GONNA PAY YOU
MORE THAN FIVE TIMES FOR THAT.
NO ONE'S GONNA VALUE YOU
AT EVEN A MULTIPLE,
AN EARNINGS MULTIPLE, BUT YOU
THREE DUDES ARE GONNA RUN FAST.
I WANT TO COME ALONG AND RUN,
TOO, BUT THE VALUE I SEE IS...
$300,000 FOR 25%.
BECAUSE TO GET TO THE
$3 MILLION VALUE, I SEE RISK.
I WASN'T GONNA GIVE YOU
ANY MORE THAN THAT EITHER.
THAT'S MY OFFER.
I'D GIVE YOU $300,000 FOR 25%.
THAT'S THE RIGHT PRICE
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES AHEAD.
IT'S A FAIR PRICE,
ACTUALLY.
DUDE, HE'S TRYING
TO WIPE YOU OUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, I DON'T THINK.
UNLESS LORI CAN TAKE --
I THINK IT'S A --
LET ME SHARE WITH YOU
MY THOUGHTS.
FROM THE FEMALE POINT OF VIEW,
I THINK THE FACT
THAT YOU GUYS ARE CLEANER DUDES
IS QUITE APPEALING.
I THINK
YOUR PACKAGING IS GREAT.
IT'S VERY CLEAR --
DUDE WIPES.
CAN'T BE SIMPLER THAN THAT,
AND IN THE RIGHT SECTION,
YOU KNOW JUST WHAT IT'S FOR.
SOUNDS LIKE
A BIG OFFER'S COMING.
BUT, UM, I FEEL
I DON'T AGREE WITH
THE $3-MILLION VALUATION.
FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT, BUT...
-WHAT?!
-WHAT?!
-...I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YEAH, BUT, LORI,
WHY ARE YOU OUT?
O'Leary: WHY?!
I'M LEAVING IT
TO MY DUDES NEXT TO ME.
SO, GUYS,
YOU HAVE TWO OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
Riley: 25%. COME ON, GUYS.
LET ME MAKE THIS WORK.
25%. 25%, THEN
WE GOT A DEAL.
WE'RE ALREADY --
WE STARTED AT 10%, SO...
GUYS WE HAD --
KEVIN, ROBERT?
I THINK THE EXTRA 2.5% IS WORTH
HAVING TWO GUYS.
THAT TELLS YOU
THEY'RE NOT THAT INTO IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
GUYS.
Corcoran: YEAH.
SERIOUSLY.
MARK, YOU MAKE
COMMENTS LIKE THAT --
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE DEAL.
IT'S TRUE!
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S OUR MONEY.
WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
WELL, MARK, IT GOES
THE OTHER WAY, TOO.
SAVE YOUR SOUL AND GET
OUT OF HERE WITHOUT THESE GUYS.
THEY SWITCHED
THE DEAL ON YOU.
H-HERE'S THE THING --
HERE'S THE THING, YOU GUYS.
IT SHOULD BE PAINFUL
IF IT'S A GREAT DEAL,
AND IT'S HURTING YOU,
IT'S A GOOD DEAL.
AND WHY WOULD THE 2.5%
MEAN ANYTHING TO THESE GUYS?
THEY'RE JUST
BEING GREEDY.
Herjavec: YOU GOT TO LOOK AT IT
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.
I'M LOWERING
MY OWN EQUITY.
I'M TAKING LESS
TO GET KEVIN INVOLVED.
I SEE VALUE
OF HAVING MULTIPLE GUYS.
IT'S 27.5%. EVERYBODY HAS
AN OPINION ONCE THEY'RE OUT.
WE'RE FIGHTING OVER 2.5%.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO WAIT?
THINK OF THE SHARKS. YOU
GOT A BULLY AND A PRETTY BOY.
SEE, ISN'T IT FUNNY
HOW THERE'S SO MUCH TALK
FROM PEOPLE
WHEN THEY GO OUT?
HEY, BARBARA,
YOU'RE JUST MAKING NOISE.
Greiner: ALL RIGHT, WHAT --
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DO?
YOU HAVE ONE DECISION TO MAKE,
AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE MADE IT,
IT'S OVER.
I'LL DO IT.
COME ON.
300K, 25%.
YEAH.
-WHOA!
-LET'S GO.
-YES!
-COME HERE.
YES!
AWESOME!
GOOD JOB.
THANKS, MARK.
THANKS, GUYS.
WE'LL CRUSH IT.
-THANK YOU.
-AWESOME.
-THANK YOU.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
YES, SIR!
Herjavec: OH, MAN.
YEAH, WHAT STYLE!
I-I ORIGINALLY WAS HESITANT
BECAUSE I'M NOT --
I'M NOT GONNA BE
A WIPES GUY.
THAT'S NOT MY STYLE.
YOU MIGHT.
BUT THESE GUYS WERE SMART,
THEY WERE AGGRESSIVE,
THEY KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
Klimkowski: THIS COULDN'T HAVE
WORKED OUT BETTER.
Meegan: MARK CAME IN
OUT OF NOWHERE, SWOOPED IT UP,
AND THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
MARK'S THE DUDE.
YEP.
