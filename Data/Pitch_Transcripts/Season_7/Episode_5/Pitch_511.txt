HI. MY NAME IS JORDAN BARROCAS,
AND I'M FROM MIAMI, FLORIDA.
I'M DANIEL FOGELSON,
AND I'M FROM LOS ANGELES.
WE'RE THE FOUNDERS
OF THREE JERKS JERKY
AND ARE HERE SEEKING
A $100,000 INVESTMENT
FOR A 15% STAKE
IN OUR COMPANY.
HAVE YOU EVER EATEN JERKY,
ONLY TO FIND YOURSELF ASKING,
"WHAT DID I JUST EAT?"
YES.
EITHER THE JERKY WAS TOUGHER
THAN SHOE LEATHER,
OR FILLED WITH SO MANY CHEMICALS
AND PRESERVATIVES,
YOU COULDN'T PRONOUNCE
MOST OF THE INGREDIENTS?
WELL, THREE JERKS JERKY
HAS CHANGED ALL THAT
BY USING ONLY THE BEST MEAT,
MADE FROM 100% FILET MIGNON.
AHH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OUR JERKY IS THE MOST TENDER
ON THE PLANET.
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHY THE MEAT MATTERS.
[ LAUGHS ]
YOU SEE, AT BEST,
MOST JERKYS ARE MADE
FROM TOP
OR BOTTOM ROUND BEEF.
WHILE THEY'RE ONE OF THE LEANEST
CUTS, IT LACKS FLAVOR,
AND YOU MIGHT LOSE A TOOTH
BITING INTO IT.
AND YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY EATING
A COW'S BUTT.
THE TENDERLOIN,
OR THE FILET MIGNON...
AHH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
...IS THE FINEST STEAK FROM THE
MOST PRECIOUS PART OF THE COW.
LEAN AND SUCCULENT,
THIS TENDER AND BUTTERY BEEF
PUTS ALL OTHER CUTS TO SHAME.
WE HAVE SOME SAMPLES, AND WOULD
LOVE FOR YOU JERKS TO TRY SOME.
Cuban: I'M GLAD HE PUT
THE MACHETE THING DOWN.
OH, WOW.
WOW.
Barrocas:
THE FIRST FLAVOR IS ORIGINAL.
IT'S OUR MOST CLASSIC
AND MOST SAVORY FLAVOR.
THE SECOND IS
MEMPHIS BARBECUE.
BE CAREFUL.
IT HAS A KICK.
AND FINALLY,
CHIPOTLE ADOBO.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
Fogelson: WE'RE EXCITED
TO BRING ON THE THIRD JERK.
WHO'S IT GONNA BE?!
TELL US ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
SO, IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS,
WE'VE HAD $350,000 IN SALES.
OH.
HOW MUCH IS EACH PACKAGE?
$11.99.
WOW. $11.9-- WOW,
YOU <i>ARE</i> A PREMIUM JERK.
WE ARE.
DEFINITELY.
BECAUSE IT'S FILET MIGNON?
THAT'S TWICE THE PRICE OF
AN AVERAGE PACKAGE OF JERK.
WHAT JERK IS BUYING THAT?
[ LAUGHS ]
IT'S TWICE THE PRICE
OF THE GENERIC JERKY,
LIKE
THE GAS STATION JERKY.
RIGHT. I BUY JERKY.
OUR BEST STORE ACTUALLY SELLS
FOR $17.
OH.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE, JORDAN?
$3.20.
CAN YOU
IMPROVE THE PRICING,
OR ARE YOU STUCK
BECAUSE YOU USE FILET?
I'M A LITTLE RESISTANT TO THINK
ABOUT JUST IMPROVING THE PRICE.
WE DO WANT TO SEPARATE OURSELVES
FROM THE COMPETITION.
WE ARE BETTER.
OUR QUALITY IS MUCH BETTER.
AND I FEEL
IF WE PRICE EQUAL TO THEM
THAT WE'RE LOSING A LITTLE BIT
OF OUR INHERENT VALUE.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
THE MONEY FOR?
THE BIG THING WITH US IS,
WE'RE GETTING KILLED ON
OUR PURCHASING,
BECAUSE WE'RE BUYING EVERYTHING
AT MINIMUMS.
YOUR COST TO GOODS
IS TOO HIGH.
YEAH, IT'S TOO HIGH.
SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BUY
A DECENT AMOUNT OF INVENTORY
WHEN THE PRICE IS LOW.
SO, JORDAN, YOU'RE SMALL.
YEAH.
TELL ME HOW
IT BECOMES A LOT BIGGER.
IS IT MORE STORES?
YES. WE NEED TO GET
INTO NATIONAL CHAINS.
Herjavec: WELL, JORDAN, I THINK
KEVIN DOES SPEAK THE TRUTH.
HE IS A BIGGER JERK
THAN US.
[ LAUGHS ]
LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU
A LITTLE MORE CASH,
'CAUSE I REALLY WANT
TO BE PART OF YOU GUYS.
HOW MUCH CASH
ARE YOU PUTTING OUT?
I'LL PUT UP $125,000
FOR MY 33%.
[ LAUGHS ]
BUT I GOT TO HAVE ENOUGH OF IT
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF THE EQUITY.
I DON'T MIND
BEING EQUAL PARTNERS.
YEAH.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER MATCHING
THEIR VALUATION?
I BUMPED IT TO $125,000.
THE TROUBLE IS,
I ACTUALLY THINK IN THIS DEAL --
AND I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE ARROGANT.
I'M JUST
SPEAKING THE TRUTH --
THAT I'M WORTH MORE
THAN THEY ARE.
WELL,
I THINK HE'S FULL OF...
[ LAUGHS ]
GUYS,
WE ALL HERE CAN HELP YOU.
AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS
TAKE MINE DOWN TO 17.5%
FOR THE $100,000.
OKAY. SO --
OKAY,
HE'S GOING THE OTHER WAY.
BUT I NEED AN ANSWER.
BUT MY ONE QUESTION TO YOU
WOULD BE,
AT THAT LEVEL OF EQUITY,
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL STILL
BE INCENTIVIZED
TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR BUSINESS
TO THE FULL EXTENT...
WOW.
...THAT ANOTHER SHARK
AT A HIGHER EQUITY LEVEL WOULD?
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S
EVER ASKED THAT,
AND THAT IS
A VALID QUESTION.
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING FOR
A THIRD.
I BELIEVE SO.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK
THE SHARK IS WILLING TO DO.
ABSOLUTELY.
HOW MUCH CASH DO YOU WANT?
I THINK $200,000 WOULD BE
A VERY FAIR DEAL.
TOO RICH, TOO RICH.
TO SHOW YOU I CARE, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GO TO $150,000.
I WANT TO BE
A THIRD PARTNER.
BUT THAT'S MY TOP OFFER.
OTHERWISE,
TAKE ONE OF THESE SHARKS.
WILL YOU MEET US HALFWAY
AT $175,000?
NO. I'LL DO $150,000
AND YOU GOT A DEAL.
IT SEEMS YOU'RE COUNTERING BACK
JUST TO KEVIN, RIGHT?
YEAH.
IN NO WAY
AM I COUNTERING BACK TO --
I MEAN, IT FEELS TO ME...
LIKE YOU'RE COUNTERING BACK
JUST TO KEVIN.
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS, GUYS?
ONE SECOND.
I'LL MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING
FOR YOU.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR 15%,
AND THEN I HAVE AN OPTION
TO GRAB ANOTHER 15%
FOR ANOTHER $100,000,
AND THAT DATING PROCESS,
YOU'LL SEE HOW HANDS-ON I AM.
YEAH.
THAT'S A BETTER DEAL
THAN YOU OFFERED.
AND THEN YOU WILL BE AT 30%
FOR $200,000.
WELL, GUYS,
I NEED THAT ANSWER RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE I LOVE
DECISIVE PARTNERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
Narrator:
ONE SHARK IS OUT.
DANIEL AND JORDAN HAVE
FOUR OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR PREMIUM JERKY COMPANY,
THREE JERKS JERKY.
WELL, GUYS,
I NEED THAT ANSWER RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE I LOVE
DECISIVE PARTNERS.
TOTALLY. THE ONE QUESTION
I JUST WANT TO RESPOND WITH
BEFORE GIVING YOU AN ANSWER
IS IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER
PARTNERING WITH ANOTHER SHARK,
IN PARTICULAR LORI.
I WOULD DO THAT DEAL,
DAYMOND.
NO.
BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GONNA GET
CONFUSED ON WHO WORKS ON WHAT.
WELL, JORDAN, I WOULD --
IF YOU WANTED TWO SHARKS,
I WOULD CONSIDER
GOING IN WITH LORI.
I'M IN ON THAT OFFER.
WE'LL GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 15%,
WITH AN OPTION FOR ANOTHER 15%
AT $100,000,
BUT YOU GET TWO SHARKS.
I'VE GONE UP TO $150,000
FOR 33%.
YOU GET THE CASH NOW.
YOU'VE GOT
TO MAKE THE DECISION.
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR GUYS' OFFERS...
...AND WE'RE GONNA GO
WITH DAYMOND.
AH! YES.
[ LAUGHS ]
I LOVE BEING A JERK!
BRING IT IN HERE.
OOH! THERE YOU GO.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
Fogelson: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, ALL.
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.
YEAH!
THANK YOU.
[ CHUCKLES ]
MAKING A DEAL WITH DAYMOND,
WE FEEL,
IS GONNA BE THE ACCELERATOR
TO OUR BUSINESS AND HELP US GROW
INTO A HUGE JERKY COMPANY
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Narrator:
IN SEASON 6 OF "SHARK TANK,"
LORI GREINER INVESTED
IN THE MINI, STUFFED BAGEL BALL,
BANTAM BAGELS.
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN 25%?
I'LL GIVE YOU 1/3.
I WOULD IF YOU DECIDE RIGHT NOW
WITH ME.
YOU'RE DONE.
YOU HAVE A DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.
Narrator: LET'S SEE HOW
BANTAM BAGELS IS DOING NOW.
[ HORN HONKS ]
SINCE "SHARK TANK,"
WE'VE BEEN ROLLING IN DOUGH.
WHEN WE PITCHED ON "SHARK TANK,"
OUR SALES WERE $200,000.
IT'S NOW BEEN EIGHT MONTHS,
AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE
OVER $2.1 MILLION IN SALES.
THAT'S OVER 2 MILLION
BAGEL BALLS SOLD.
WHEN WE MADE OUR DEAL, LORI WAS
CONCERNED ABOUT OUR BRANDING,
AND THAT'S WHERE
BAGEL STUFFINS CAME IN.
THIS WAY,
WHEN A CONSUMER SEES OUR PRODUCT
IN THE GROCERY STORE,
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND RIGHT AWAY
WHAT WE ARE.
WE'RE SO GRATEFUL
FOR ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES
THAT "SHARK TANK" HAS GIVEN US,
AND THE DOORS KEEP OPENING.
Greiner:
ARE YOU GUYS EXCITED?
YEAH!
I AM SO EXCITED.
I'M IN NEW YORK TODAY
WITH NICK AND ELYSE
BECAUSE WE JUST CLOSED A DEAL
WITH STARBUCKS.
OH, MY GOSH!
[ GASPS ]
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO,
STARBUCKS AGREED
TO TEST BANTAM BAGELS IN 32
OF THEIR NEW YORK STORES.
THAT SMALL TEST
WAS A SUCCESS.
SO STARTING TODAY,
BANTAM BAGELS ARE AVAILABLE
IN 400 OF THEIR LOCATIONS.
IF THEY CONTINUE TO EXPAND
AT THIS RATE,
WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL
TO BE IN 7,000 STARBUCKS
LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE.
IT REALLY DOESN'T GET
ANY BIGGER THAN THIS.
CHEERS!
CHEERS!
TO BANTAM BAGELS.
Elyse: WALKING INTO STARBUCKS
AND SEEING OUR BAGELS
MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE WE'VE MADE IT.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.
LORI JUST HELPED US CLOSE
A HUGE DEAL WITH DELTA AIRLINES.
WE'RE GONNA BE
ON ALL FIRST-CLASS FLIGHTS
FLYING OUT OF EVERY
NEW YORK AIRPORT COMING SOON.
YAY!
RAH, RAH, RAH, RAH, RAH!
Elyse:
THIS DEAL WITH STARBUCKS IS
GAME-CHANGING FOR OUR BUSINESS,
BUT IT'S ONLY
THE BEGINNING.
WE ARE NOT STOPPING UNTIL WE
CHANGE THE WAY AMERICA BAGELS.
