ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,
FOUNDED ONE OF
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS
AND HAS LAUNCHED
MORE THAN 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
ESTEEMED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
ROBERT, WE GET A WHOLE TRAY.
Herjavec: OH, MY GOSH.
MMM.
THIS SMELLS REALLY GOOD.
I LOVE BEEF JERKY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S SO GOOD.
OH, ROBERT.
Greiner: OH, MY GOD.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
EAT IT YET.
IT'S AMAZING.
WOW.
I WASN'T KIDDING.
THIS TIME, YOU WEREN'T.
HOW LONG CAN YOU STORE IT?
ISN'T THAT A PROBLEM?
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. WE CAN STORE
IT FOR UP TO A YEAR FROZEN.
O'Leary:
DO YOU USE A CO-PACKER?
WE DO USE A CO-PACKER.
AND DO THEY HAVE CAPACITY
TO QUADRUPLE?
OH, TOTALLY.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
WE CAN MAKE 50,000 UNITS
PER WEEK.
ARE YOU GETTING PUSHBACK
ON THIS 19% SODIUM?
COMPARED TO
OTHER JERKYS...
YEAH, IT'S LOW.
...IT'S MINIMAL.
WE DON'T USE ANY ARTIFICIAL
PRESERVATIVES, NO NITRATES.
IT'S GLUTEN-FREE, WHICH,
MOST JERKY, SURPRISINGLY,
IS FILLED WITH GLUTEN.
BUT THIS IS PROBABLY
GONNA SELL BETTER --
SO, SINCE DAY ONE,
WE'VE DONE ALL OUR SALES
OURSELVES.
HOW BIG IS THE TEAM?
IT'S JUST US,
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.
IT'S THE TWO OF US.
THERE'S TWO GUYS, THREE JERKS.
WHERE'S THE THIRD JERK?
SO, WHEN WE FIRST STARTED
THE COMPANY, THERE WERE THREE.
YOU WHACKED A JERK?
A LITTLE TOO MUCH
OF A JERK.
A QUICK QUESTION
ABOUT YOUR BRANDING --
JUST SO I UNDERSTAND IT --
THERE'S A BEAR,
AND THERE'S A DONKEY,
AND THERE'S A CHICKEN
OR SOMETHING UNDERNEATH IT.
SO, THAT WAS -- BACK WHEN
THERE WERE THREE OF US,
WE ALL CHOSE ANIMALS
THAT WERE REPRESENTATIVE
OF OUR PERSONALITIES.
SO YOU'RE THE BEAR.
I'M THE BEAR.
HE'S THE WISEASS.
YOU'RE THE DONKEY.
AND THE GUY THAT GOT WHACKED
IS THE CHICKEN?
THE CHICKEN -- SOMETIMES
WE CALLED HIM A COCK.
[ BOTH LAUGHING ]
WOW!
O'Leary: I LIKE IT.
IT'S A FLYER, BECAUSE
THE JERKY BUSINESS IS HUGE,
AND IT'S DOMINATED BY --
BUT IT'S ALSO
INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE.
THERE'S A LOT OF
SMALL MANUFACTURERS
THAT DO $50,000 TO $100,000
IN SALES
THAT CALL THEMSELVES
PREMIUM.
BUT WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
USING FILET MIGNON.
YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO REASON
THEY CAN'T DO IT EITHER.
LOOK, I LIKE YOU GUYS.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
IT'S A FLYER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000.
I WANT TO BE A THIRD PARTNER.
I WANT 33%.
SO, $100,000.
YOU ASKED FOR $100,000.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000,
AND I WANT 33%.
I WANT TO BE THE THIRD -- I WANT
TO BE THE SHARK, NOT THE JERK.
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST
REASONABLE OFFER HE'S EVER MADE.
UM, YOU KNOW,
MY RESPONSE TO THAT
WOULD BE JUST BASED
ON OUR VALUATION.
I DON'T THINK
YOUR VALUATION'S CRAZY.
I JUST KNOW WHAT I'M WORTH.
I LIKE YOU GUYS.
YOU KNOW I'M A MEMBER
OF THE CHEVALIER DU TASTEVIN.
[ LAUGHS ]
AND YOU'RE A CONNOISSEUR
OF THE FROMAGE.
I ONLY DO QUALITY.
AND THEY SERVE JERKY.
I WILL DRINK THIS
WITH A GLASS OF BURGUNDY
'CAUSE IT'S VERY GOOD.
Cuban: GUYS,
I LOVE YOUR BUSINESS.
I LOVE BEEF JERKY.
I AM AN AFICIONADO.
I MEAN,
YOU NAME IT, I'VE TRIED IT.
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THE JERKY
MARKET IS BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE.
YOU'RE JUST IN
THE FIRST INNING.
THE STRUGGLE
IS JUST BEGINNING.
I'M JUST NOT READY
TO TAKE THAT JOURNEY,
AND FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
OKAY. THANK YOU.
BUT I WILL BE A CUSTOMER.
I THINK YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF
THINGS REALLY WELL.
I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE
A GRIND,
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
AND I LOVE BEEF JERKY.
I'LL GIVE YOU $100,000
FOR 20%.
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
THANK YOU.
GUYS, I'M A JERKOLOGIST.
[ LAUGHS ]
MY MOTHER USED TO SAY
THERE'S TWO THINGS --
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MUCH
HOT SAUCE OR BEEF JERKY
IN THE HOUSE.
YEAH.
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
BUT I LIKE THIS.
I WORK WITH
SOME OF THE BIG DISTRIBUTORS.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $100,000
FOR 20%.
THANK YOU.
AND I'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING.
OH!
I'M GONNA DO THE $100,000,
ALSO FOR 20%.
THANK YOU.
KEVIN, I THINK I'M WORTH MORE
THAN THE AVERAGE SHARK.
I'M MR. WONDERFUL.
I'VE GOT TO BE PAID
A MR. WONDERFUL PREMIUM.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
AND THERE'S NO TRANSPARENCY.
WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME JUST SAY THIS, BECAUSE --
CAN I JUST FINISH, PLEASE?!
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
NO!
THE FOURTH THING --
WOMEN BELIEVE THEY ARE
TWO TO THREE SIZES LARGER
THAN THEY ARE
IN REAL LIFE.
IS THAT TRUE?
YES.
EVEN I TOOK THE SURVEY,
AND I BELIEVED I WAS
TWO TO THREE SIZES LARGER.
WHEN YOU GO TO
A RETAIL STORE,
DO SOME OF THE STORES
NOT TELL CUSTOMERS AND SOME DO,
OR DO ALL THE STORES
THAT BUY IT
NOT TELL CUSTOMERS
IT'S A SPECIAL MIRROR?
WE'VE HAD BIG-NAME RETAILERS
CALL US FOR A QUOTE
AND ASKED US
TO REMOVE THE LOGO
ON THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER
OF THE MIRROR.
SO, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A $700,000 ORDER.
BUT WHEN I STARTED
THIS COMPANY,
I SAID, "THIS MIRROR WOULD NOT
BE USED TO DECEIVE ANYONE."
AND THAT'S WHY
I TOLD THEM --
BUT IT'S DOING IT
EVERY DAY.
EVEN THOUGH
I COULD HAVE LOST --
YOU'RE SAYING THEY HAVE TO FIND
YOUR LITTLE LOGO DOWN THERE
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU CAN SEE IT. ALL YOU
GOT TO DO IS JUST TAKE A LOOK.
SO, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
THE CONSUMER MODEL.
THIS IS THE FIRST MODEL.
THIS RETAILS FOR $165.
THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM
FOR ME.
I HAVE TO BE OUT.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS ROB BOULEY.
AND I'M HIS SISTER-IN-LAW,
LAURA RILEY.
Both: AND WE ARE SWITCH WITCH
FROM SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS!
MM-HMM.
SHARKS, WE ARE SEEKING $55,000
FOR 25% EQUITY IN OUR COMPANY.
FOR PARENTS, THE SCARIEST PART
OF HALLOWEEN IS TOO MUCH CANDY.
SWITCH WITCH IS
A CHILDREN'S BOOK AND DOLL
THAT SOLVES THAT PROBLEM.
AND THE REAL MAGIC IS,
IT'S FUN FOR KIDS!
HEY, GUYS.
HI.
HOW WAS TRICK-OR-TREATING?
HOW WAS TRICK-OR-TREATING?
ALL RIGHT!
COME ON OVER HERE.
OH, WOW.
LOOK AT ALL OF YOUR CANDY!
WOW!
GO AHEAD, GUYS.
SIT RIGHT DOWN
ON THE END OF THE BED --
RIGHT ON THE END
OF THE BED.
HEY, WE'RE GOING TO READ
THE SWITCH WITCH STORY.
[ JOHN LAUGHS ]
"THE SUN GOES DOWN.
IT'S TIME FOR BED.
GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH,
YOU SLEEPYHEAD.
LEAVE YOUR SWEETS
WITH YOUR SWITCH WITCH FRIEND
WHEN KIND GOODBYES
HAVE ALL BEEN SAID."
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
POUR YOUR CANDY IN THE BUCKET.
SWITCH WITCH IS COMING TONIGHT.
SWITCH WITCH IS COMING.
DUMP IT ALL IN.
[ HERJAVEC LAUGHS ]
ALL RIGHT! WHOO-HOO!
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
OKAY,
LIE DOWN FOR BED, GUYS.
THAT'S THE WAY
THE SWITCH WITCH COMES.
GO AHEAD, LIE RIGHT NOW.
GOODNIGHT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Riley: "WHILE YOU'RE ASLEEP,
THESE WORDS WILL RING.
YOU MIGHT, MIGHT HEAR
YOUR SWITCH WITCH SING.
SWITCH-A-ZAM!
SWITCH-A-ZING!"
OOH!
WOW!
"SWITCH THESE TREATS
FOR A SPECIAL THING!
WHEN MORNING COMES UP
WITH THE SUN..."
GUYS, WAKE UP!
LOOK, LOOK!
LOOK AT THE GIFTS
FOR ALL YOUR CANDY!
"...YOUR GIFT IS THERE,
ALL SET AND DONE.
SOMETHING YOU'LL LOVE,
IT'S SURE TO BE."
[ LAUGHS ]
THREE CHEERS FOR
SUPER SWITCH WITCH FUN!
Bouley: OKAY, GUYS.
WHOO!
THANKS SO MUCH.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.
Cuban: GREAT COSTUMES, GUYS,
All: OH!
OH, THE SHARK WENT DOWN.
DOWN GOES THE SHARK.
Riley:
ALL RIGHT, GOOD JOB, KIDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
GOOD JOB. BYE.
SHARKS, WE KNOW OUR PRODUCT
IS FUN FOR KIDS
AND A PROBLEM SOLVER
FOR PARENTS,
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP
IN THIS MAGICAL JOURNEY
TO TAKE THE SWITCH WITCH
TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD ACROSS
AMERICA EVERY HALLOWEEN.
SO LET ME GET THIS RIGHT -- YOU
BASICALLY TAKE THE KIDS' CANDY,
AND WHEN THEY WAKE UP,
THEIR CANDY'S GONE.
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT LITIGATION?
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT WHEN THEY SEE
THE GIFT THEY'VE RECEIVED
FROM THEIR SWITCH WITCH.
SO, THE WAY
THE WHOLE IDEA CAME UP IS...
[ GROWLS ]
...MY KIDS CAME HOME
HALLOWEEN NIGHT, 2013,
AND MY WIFE YELLS TO ME,
"ROB, ROB!
DO WE HAVE ANYTHING
TO GIVE THE KIDS?"
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?"
SHE GOES,
"SWITCH WITCH IS COMING."
I SAID,
"WHO IS THE SWITCH WITCH?"
MY KIDS THREW EVERY OUNCE
OF CANDY THEY HAD
RIGHT UP
ON THE COUNTERTOP.
AND WE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING FOR THEM.
I ACTUALLY THREW THEM
FIVE BUCKS EACH.
WE TOOK THE CANDY AWAY.
I SAID, "WOW.
WHAT A BRILLIANT IDEA?"
SO, ROB, LET ME
UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT.
YES.
I'M A CHILD.
I GO OUT TRICK-OR-TREATING.
YES, YOU ARE.
[ LAUGHS ] THANK YOU.
I COME HOME WITH MY CANDY.
I DUMP IT, AFTER ALL THAT CANDY
I LOOKED FORWARD TO ALL YEAR,
AND YOU GIVE ME THIS
IN EXCHANGE?
[ LAUGHS ]
ACTUALLY,
THE SWITCH WITCH LEAVES.
AND WE DON'T ENCOURAGE KIDS
TO LEAVE ALL OF THEIR CANDY.
OH, THEY ONLY GIVE UP
SOME OF IT?
WELL,
THEY PICK THEIR FAVORITES.
AND IT'S DEPENDENT
ON THE PARENTS.
BUT YOU GIVE THEM JUST THIS,
OR YOU GIVE THEM --
NO. A GIFT.
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BASICALLY
HAS TO BE VIRAL ON ITS OWN.
YES.
IT CAN'T BE FORCED.
SO I'M TRYING --
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT.
MY KIDS HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT.
NEVER HEARD OF IT.
YEAH,
SO THAT MAKES ME CONCERNED
THAT IT'S NOT VIRAL
AND IT'S BEING FORCED.
Bouley:
WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME IS,
WHEN YAHOO! DID A THING ON US
ON OCTOBER 30th,
OUR SALES JUMPED LIKE CRAZY.
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS OCTOBER 30th.
[ LAUGHS ]
IT ENDED UP,
OUR FACEBOOK ENDED UP
GOING VIRAL.
O'Leary: THE SEASONALITY
OF THIS IDEA IS BRUTAL,
AND THE NEXT DAY AFTER
HALLOWEEN, NO ONE CARES.
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE SAYING,
"NO ONE CARES ABOUT CHRISTMAS
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE DAY,
AND THEN IT'S OVER."
NO, BUT CHRISTMAS HAS
A HUGE LEAD UP.
YOU SAID THE CONCEPT'S
BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE.
CORRECT. SO THAT'S --
SO THIS IS PUBLIC DOMAIN.
IT IS.
Cuban: SO, TELL US, BY UNIT,
WHAT IT SELLS FOR,
WHAT IT COSTS YOU,
AND THEN, IN AGGREGATE,
WHAT YOUR SALES ARE.
WE RAN INTO SOME TROUBLE
MANUFACTURING.
WE DID IT ALL
IN THE UNITED STATES.
SO WE STARTED AT $29.95.
O'Leary:
IT'S A PLUSH TOY FOR $29.
A LITTLE STEEP, RIGHT?
WITH A BOOK, WITH A BOOK.
AND THE PACKAGING.
AND WE PRICED IT AT
ELF ON THE SHELF,
MENSCH ON A BENCH.
MENSCH ON A BENCH, LORI.
Cuban: BUT WHERE
WERE YOU SELLING THEM,
AND HOW MANY DID
YOU REALLY SELL?
WE SOLD 815 UNITS
IN OUR FIRST SEASON.
52% WAS ONLINE --
AMAZON AND OUR OWN WEBSITE.
WE DID 24% GRASSROOTS.
I WAS OUT KNOCKING ON DOORS.
I WAS IN SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS.
WE WERE AT CRAFT FAIRS.
PEOPLE LOVED THIS PRODUCT,
AND WE SOLD THEM.
SO YOUR SALES
WERE $24,000?
MY SALES WERE $15,700.
PARENTS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH IT.
WHY DIDN'T IT TAKE OFF?
WE FEEL IT DID.
I MEAN, IT WAS OUR FIRST SEASON.
$15,000 IS NOTHING.
WE DID THOSE SALES IN ONE MONTH
FROM GRASSROOTS.
AND, LOOK, THE MERIT OF REDUCING
SUGAR IS RIGHT ON TREND.
HOWEVER, FOR AN INVESTOR,
THIS IS A NONPROPRIETARY
PLUSH DOLL WITH NO BRAND, RIGHT?
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.
I THINK
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE CUE
FROM WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
IN SALEM.
IN THE OLD DAYS,
YOU USED TO BURN THE WITCHES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IF I WERE YOU, I'D TAKE THIS
BEHIND THE BARN AND BURN IT,
'CAUSE I THINK IT SUCKS.
I'M OUT.
ESPECIALLY WITH THE MEDIA
THAT YOU HAD, GUYS.
I MEAN, NOBODY EVER
WALKS ONTO THE CARPET
AND SAYS, "PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
OUR PRODUCT," RIGHT?
OF COURSE WE EXPECT YOU TO SAY
AND THINK THAT PEOPLE LOVED IT.
BUT IT DIDN'T SELL.
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU RAN OUT OF PRODUCT.
THE BIG MEDIA PUSH
WAS THE DAY BEFORE HALLOWEEN.
STILL --
AND MOSTLY, THE ONLY
VENUE FOR PEOPLE TO GET
THE PRODUCT WAS ONLINE.
PEOPLE WERE PAYING
OVERNIGHT SHIPPING,
SO, AFTER THEY SAW
THE YAHOO! ARTICLE
SO THAT THEY COULD GET IT
IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN.
LAURA, I THINK, YOU KNOW,
FOR ME, I LOVE HALLOWEEN.
I LOVE THE IDEA
OF GETTING FREE CANDY.
SO I CAN'T GET BEHIND IT.
I DON'T SEE IT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY, THANK YOU, ROBERT.
WE'RE REALLY TRYING
TO BUILD A WHOLE
FAMILY TRADITION AROUND IT.
LOOK, WE DID A DEAL
WITH MENSCH ON A BENCH,
AND THERE'S SO MANY DAYS
OF HANUKKAH.
SAME AS WITH THE ELF THAT'S
ON THE SHELF FOR SO MANY DAYS.
BUT HERE, IT'S LIKE A ONE-NIGHT,
ONE-TIME THING,
WHEREAS BOTH OF THOSE MODELS,
IT'S MANY DAYS AND A LEAD-UP.
THIS IS, TOO.
SO...
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, LORI.
LORI -- CAN I TRANSLATE
WHAT SHE JUST SAID?
WHAT SHE SAID IS,
YOUR IDEA SUCKS.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WELL, GUYS,
HALLOWEEN IS
A $7.4 BILLION INDUSTRY.
$2.2 BILLION --
YOU JUST BROKE
THE CARDINAL RULE.
YOU JUST BROKE
THE CARDINAL RULE.
WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN
AND TELLS US
THAT IT'S JUST AN ENORMOUS,
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY,
SUGGESTING THAT, "OH,
IF WE JUST GET A TINY
AMOUNT, WE'LL BE OKAY."
AND, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
I THINK YOU'RE INTRODUCING MORE
STRESS THAN YOU'RE SOLVING,
I MEAN,
BECAUSE, AS A PARENT --
AND I HAVE THREE YOUNG KIDS,
TOO, RIGHT?
THEY'RE YOUNG ENOUGH WHERE
WE'RE STILL TAKING THEM AROUND.
WHEN THEY COME BACK,
WE'RE GRABBING THE BAG,
THROWING HALF OF IT AWAY,
LETTING THEM PICK THEIR BEST,
AND GETTING IT DONE.
I JUST THINK, YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO PUSH SOMETHING
FORWARD AND MAKE IT VIRAL.
IT KIND OF HAS TO BE
ORGANICALLY VIRAL.
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MARK.
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE.
FIRST OF ALL,
THIS COULD BE A HOBBY...
...WHICH COULD BE GREAT.
YOU CAN GROW
INTO SOMETHING BIG.
FUBU WAS A HOBBY FOR ME
AT FIRST.
I THINK
IT'S A GREAT HOBBY
THAT MAY GROW
INTO SOMETHING AMAZING.
IT JUST MAY BE TOO SOON FOR ME,
SO I'M OUT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
Greiner:
THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK.
Bouley:
WHEN WE CAME HERE, WE THOUGHT
FOR SURE WE'D GET A DEAL.
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT
THE SHARKS MISSED OUT
ON A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
WE ARE GOING TO BE THE NEXT
MENSCH ON A BENCH
AND ELF ON THE SHELF.
[ MOTOR WHIRRING ]
Narrator: NEXT INTO
THE TANK IS A BUSINESS
THAT ASPIRES TO MAKE UNMANNED
FLIGHT ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERYONE.
YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROBABLY BE
IN A HELICOPTER
TO ACCOMPANY IT, RIGHT?
OR YOU CAN BE STATIONARY.
YOU CAN BE STATIONARY,
YEAH.
I MEAN, DEFINITELY,
IT'S MANEUVERABLE,
SO YOU CAN STAY
WITHIN VISUAL RANGE.
BUT ONE KEY PART
IS THAT THIS SYSTEM
ACTUALLY CAN RUN
ENTIRELY AUTONOMOUSLY.
YOU CAN BUILD A FLIGHT PLAN
ON A SOFTWARE SYSTEM ON A PC
AND HAVE IT GO DO THOSE THINGS
AND COME BACK.
YES, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
ROBERT.
THERE ARE REGULATIONS AND RULES
RIGHT NOW,
AND PRIMARILY, IF YOU'RE FLYING
FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES,
YOU NEED TO KEEP IT
WITHIN LINE OF SIGHT,
STAY AWAY FROM
OTHER AIRCRAFT AND AIRPORTS,
AS WELL AS
PERSONAL PROPERTY,
AND THEN, YOU CAN'T FLY
ANY HIGHER THAN 400 FEET.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
IT COSTS US $400
TO MAKE IT.
AND WHAT DO YOU
SELL IT FOR?
IT RETAILS RIGHT NOW
FOR $1,800.
HAVE YOU SOLD ANY?
YEAH. WE'VE GOT $173,000
RIGHT NOW IN PRESALES.
AND THAT'S KICKSTARTER,
THEN?
YES.
KICKSTARTER WAS $143,000,
AND THEN WE'VE DONE ABOUT
$30,000 SINCE ON OUR WEBSITE.
GUYS, WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
ARE YOU ENGINEERS OR --
YEAH, SO, I HAVE WORKED -- I'M
AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER BY TRADE.
I STARTED AT A SCHOOL
AND WORKED AT ORACLE
AND HAVE BEEN IN SOFTWARE
MY WHOLE HISTORY.
I WAS LOOKING AT SOME DRONES
YESTERDAY, ACTUALLY,
BECAUSE I HAVE A PROPERTY
WITH 36 ACRES,
AND I WANT TO BUY SOMETHING
'CAUSE I'M GETTING A DESIGNATION
OF MANAGED FOREST,
AND ONE OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES
IS TO SCAN IT EVERY YEAR
AND LOOK FOR DISEASED TREES,
SO I'M GONNA BUY A DRONE.
CAN I CONFIGURE THE CAMERA
ON A GYROSCOPE BELOW IT
SO THAT I CAN FILM
FROM BELOW?
'CAUSE I HAVE TO TURN IT INTO
AIRPLANE MODE TO USE THAT CAMERA
THE WAY YOU'VE GOT IT
CONFIGURED.
WE'RE WORKING ON IT
RIGHT NOW
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY
HOVER IT INVERTED.
AND...
Herjavec:
OH, THERE'S MORE?
YEAH. [ LAUGHS ]
SO, THIS IS CALLED PhoneDrone.
Cuban: A WHAT?
GREINER: PhoneDrone.
PhoneDrone.
PROBABLY LESS THAN $100
TO MAKE.
'CAUSE THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS
THAT PROBLEM PRETTY QUICKLY.
I-I'M INTERESTED.
I SEE A LOT OF OIL AND GAS,
SECURITY --
ALL KINDS OF APPLICATIONS
FOR IT -- DEFENSE.
I'M INTERESTED.
WE'RE ALL INTERESTED.
MARK, ARE YOU INTERESTED?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
MARK'S NOT SAYING.
I'M OKAY WITH THAT DEAL,
AS WELL.
THAT'S THREE. ROBERT?
THEN I'M IN ON THAT DEAL,
TOO.
MARK...WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU GUYS ARE SMART.
DID ANYBODY ELSE OFFER YOU MONEY
PRIOR TO THIS?
