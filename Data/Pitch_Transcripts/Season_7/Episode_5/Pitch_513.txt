MY NAME IS BELINDA JASMINE,
AND I LIVE
IN SAND CITY, CALIFORNIA.
I LIKE TO SURF
AND BE OUTDOORS,
AND I HAVE A REALLY ACTIVE
AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.
BUT, LIKE MANY WOMEN,
I'VE DEVELOPED ISSUES
WITH MY BODY IMAGE.
A LOT OF TIMES,
WHEN I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR,
I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT I SAW, AND
THAT AFFECTED MY CONFIDENCE.
MY PRODUCT TAUGHT ME IT DOESN'T
MATTER HOW OTHER PEOPLE SEE ME.
WHAT MATTERS IS
HOW I SEE MYSELF.
AND IF I FEEL BEAUTIFUL,
OTHER PEOPLE WILL SEE ME
AS BEAUTIFUL, TOO.
30x68?
YEAH.
I NEED AN INVESTMENT
FROM THE SHARKS
SO I CAN INCREASE PRODUCTION
AND LOWER COSTS.
IF I DON'T GET AN INVESTMENT,
I COULD LOSE EVERYTHING.
MY CAR IS ON COLLATERAL.
I HAVE MY LIFE SAVINGS INTO IT.
AND EVEN MY FAMILY HAS A LOT
OF THEIR SAVINGS INTO IT, TOO,
SO THERE'S A LOT
RIDING ON THIS.
I REALLY HOPE THE SHARKS
CAN SEE MY VISION
AND HELP ME GET MY PRODUCT
IN FRONT OF WOMEN EVERYWHERE.
MY NAME IS BELINDA JASMINE,
AND I'M FROM
SAND CITY, CALIFORNIA.
MY COMPANY IS
THE SKINNY MIRROR.
AND I'M SEEKING $200,000 IN
EXCHANGE FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
THE SKINNY MIRROR SETS
A REVOLUTIONARY NEW STANDARD
THAT WILL ENABLE THE USER
TO SEE THEIR TRUE SELF.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU LOOKED IN THE MIRROR,
GRABBED AT YOUR STOMACH,
AND SAID,
"MAN, I REALLY NEED
TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS"?
WHETHER WE ADMIT IT OR NOT,
ALMOST EVERYONE CAN RELATE.
WHAT WE OFTEN FORGET, THOUGH,
IS HOW WE FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES
LARGELY AFFECTS
HOW OTHER PEOPLE SEE US.
THE SKINNY MIRROR DESIGN
OFFERS
A SUBTLE, BELIEVABLE,
SLIMMING REFLECTION
DESIGNED TO HELP YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOUR BODY.
WE'VE ALL HEARD
THAT CLICHÉ PHRASE
"IF YOU LOOK GOOD,
YOU FEEL GOOD."
WELL, WE REALIZED
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
IF YOU FEEL GOOD, YOU
[SNAPS FINGERS] LOOK GOOD.
[ SNAPS FINGERS ]
WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR
EVERY DAY
AND YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE...
[ CHUCKLES ]
...IT GIVES YOU THE INSPIRATION
TO LOOK AND FEEL YOUR BEST.
SO, WOULD ANY OF YOU LIKE TO
COME TRY OUT THE SKINNY MIRROR?
BOY, DO I NEED THAT.
I WILL.
I WANT TO SEE THE COMPARISON.
LADIES FIRST.
GO AHEAD AND TRY IT OUT.
OOH, I LIKE THIS MIRROR.
ALL RIGHT, DAYMOND. COME VIEW.
WHAT DID YOU THINK, LORI?
I WANT TO SEE --
I LOOK SKINNIER.
THAT'S FOR SURE.
YOUR HEAD GOT SMALLER.
WOW.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
Greiner: OH, WOW.
Herjavec: WOW!
VERY NICE.
SO NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CARRY THAT MIRROR
EVERYWHERE YOU GO.
Greiner: YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, WOW.
BELINDA, ON DAYMOND
IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE,
BUT ON LORI,
NOT TO SUCK UP TO HER,
IT DIDN'T MAKE
THAT BIG A DIFFERENCE.
IT'S BECAUSE
IT'S FARTHER BACK.
YEAH. USUALLY,
THE IDEAL PLACE TO STAND
IS ABOUT 3 TO FIVE 5 FEET,
SO --
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE A LOT OF WOMEN
SAY THAT TO DAYMOND --
THE FARTHER BACK HE IS,
THE BETTER HE LOOKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BELINDA,
IT'S SUPPORTING A FALSEHOOD,
BECAUSE THE REAL MOTIVATION TO
SLIM DOWN IS TO LOOK AT REALITY,
DEAL WITH THE TRUTH
EVERY DAY,
AND FINALLY GET AROUND
TO THE IDEA THAT LOSING
WEIGHT'S HARD WORK.
AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE
THE RESULTS, THE <i>REAL</i> RESULTS,
YOU'RE VERY MOTIVATED
TO MAINTAIN IT.
THIS IS A FALSEHOOD.
THIS IS A LIE TO SOMEBODY.
SO, LET ME ASK YOU THIS --
WHEN YOU ROLLED OUT OF BED
THIS MORNING,
IS THAT
WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE?
PRETTY MUCH.
YEAH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, LET'S NOT DEBATE
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD.
HOW MANY MIRRORS
HAVE YOU SOLD?
WE'VE SOLD ABOUT 350 UNITS,
AND --
FOR HOW MUCH?
A TOTAL -- TOTAL OF $85,000.
IS IT ALL
CLOTHING STORES?
YES,
AND HOTELS, ACTUALLY.
OH,
SO IT'S NOT CONSUMERS.
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A FALSEHOOD
BASED ON THE PREMISE
A RETAILER CAN SELL A DRESS
BECAUSE IT LOOKS BETTER
ON SOMEBODY.
YOU'RE BASICALLY PUTTING
A MIRROR INTO A RETAIL STORE
WHERE A WOMAN,
A RUBENESQUE WOMAN, PERHAPS,
WOULD PUT ON A DRESS AND
ALL OF A SUDDEN FLATTER HERSELF
BY THE FACT
A FALSEHOOD'S BEING PORTRAYED.
UNTIL SHE GETS HOME
AND PUTS IT ON.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS --
WE HAD A MARKET STUDY DONE
IN SWEDEN LAST YEAR.
THE FINDINGS THAT
CAME OUT OF THE SURVEY -- ONE.
THE WOMEN WHO WERE USING
THE SKINNY MIRROR
BOUGHT ALMOST 20%
MORE CLOTHES.
WELL,
OF COURSE THEY DID!
WOMEN WERE MORE SATISFIED
WITH THEIR BODIES.
THEIR IDEAL BODY
AND THEIR ACTUAL BODY,
THERE WAS A SMALLER GAP.
BUT, BELINDA, YOU DON'T HAVE
A PATENT ON THIS TECHNOLOGY.
IS THE MIRROR ACTUALLY
THAT SKINNY?
ANYBODY CAN ORDER
THAT PIECE OF GLASS.
EXACTLY. IT IS -- BUT IT IS
THE -- IT'S THE INTENTION
AND THE BRANDING
OF THE PRODUCT.
OKAY, I GET IT.
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT YOUR BRAND, SKINNY MIRROR,
IS WORTH $1 MILLION TODAY?
I'VE SEEN THE POTENTIAL.
HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOOK
AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR?
[ LAUGHS ]
LOOK, YOU KNOW,
I DEAL IN REALITY.
COME ON. DON'T BE AFRAID.
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS --
I WILL NOT BE PART --
I WILL NOT BE PART OF THIS SHAM,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
AND LOOK, LOOK.
YOU CAN SMILE
ALL YOU WANT,
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
YOU'RE LYING TO PEOPLE.
I'M OUT, BUT I ALSO
FORBID ANY OTHER SHARK
IN INVESTING IN THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S IT.
OKAY, LET ME TELL YOU THIS,
ALL RIGHT?
SO, YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY
THE CAMERA ADDS 10 POUNDS?
RIGHT.
WHEN YOU LOOK IN
A NORMAL MIRROR,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A FLAT,
TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE.
THE SAME THING HAPPENS.
IT FLATTENS YOU OUT.
WE ARE
THREE-DIMENSIONAL BEINGS.
WE HAVE CURVES.
THIS IS ALL CRAP!
[ LAUGHS ] LET ME FINISH.
YOU'RE LYING TO PEOPLE!
LET ME FINISH.
TELL THE TRUTH!
LOOK,
I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES.
YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
YOU FEEL BETTER, RIGHT?
BUT WHEN THAT MIRROR IS USED TO
INCENT A PURCHASE OF SOME SORT,
THE CHALLENGE THERE
IS FOR THE BRAND,
WHOEVER'S USING THAT
IN THEIR RETAIL STORE
AND SELLING CLOTHES,
IF THAT CUSTOMER FEELS,
"YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S NOT
THE WAY I LOOKED IN THE STORE.
WHAT HAPPENED?"
THEN THAT BRAND SUFFERS.
AND IN TERMS
OF AN INVESTMENT,
THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF
UNCERTAINTY THAT I THINK --
OR RISK THAT I'D LIKE TO TAKE
IN MY INVESTMENTS.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
BELINDA, I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE PRODUCT.
I THINK WOMEN IN GENERAL
AND MANY MEN
LOVE ANYTHING
THAT MAKES THEM LOOK BETTER,
THAT MAKES THEM
FEEL BETTER.
I MEAN,
ISN'T THAT WHAT FAKE HAIR IS?
EXACTLY!
ISN'T THAT WHAT MAKEUP IS?
WHERE IT...FALLS APART IS
IF A CUSTOMER LOOKS AT THAT
AND THEY LOOK GREAT
IN THAT OUTFIT,
AND THEN
THEY TAKE IT HOME,
AND THEY OBVIOUSLY LOOK BAD
OR DIFFERENT,
THEY'RE NOT
GONNA BE HAPPY.
UNLESS THEY HAVE
A SKINNY MIRROR AT HOME.
BELINDA,
I'VE GOT SOME ISSUES WITH IT.
I JUST CAN'T
GET AROUND THEM.
I'M OUT.
LET ME PUT THIS BACK.
WHY DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?
WHY DID I
COME UP WITH THIS?
BECAUSE I HAD A FAT MIRROR,
AND I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS ADDING
10 POUNDS TO MY REFLECTION.
I STARTED TO DEVELOP
BODY INSECURITIES.
I'M A SURFER.
I'M PRETTY ACTIVE.
I EAT HEALTHY.
I'VE NEVER REALLY HAD
BODY ISSUES BEFORE.
AND SO, ONE DAY, MY FRIEND
CAME OVER, AND SHE SAID,
"THAT MIRROR ADDS 10 POUNDS,"
AND THE LIGHT WENT OFF.
HOW COULD THIS MIRROR AFFECT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT MY BODY
IF I'M SUCH
A HEALTH ADVOCATE?
THAT'S WHY
I NEED YOUR HELP!
I WANT TO SHARE THIS
WITH THE WORLD
AND HELP WOMEN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THEIR BODIES.
I THINK THAT...
I THINK THAT IT'S DANGEROUS.
IT IS.
BECAUSE I THINK
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO ALWAYS NOT BE WHO THEY ARE
AND LIVE AN UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE,
AND I CAN'T
GET BEHIND THAT.
I'M OUT.
OKAY.
MOST WOMEN WANT TO BE THINNER
THAN THEY ARE.
MM-HMM.
AND THEY ALWAYS FEEL
THAT THEY LOOK HEAVIER.
THAT'S TRUE.
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING IN A RETAIL PLACE
AND HAVING A MIRROR THAT,
IN KEVIN'S WORDS, DECEIVES YOU
INTO THINKING
THAT YOU LOOK BETTER,
AND THEN
YOU MAKE A PURCHASE.
AND IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T KNOW
THAT THEY'RE IN A STORE
AND THEY'RE LOOKING
IN A SKINNY MIRROR,
THANK YOU, BELINDA.
THAT WAS FINE. THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK, BELINDA.
OKAY.
SHE WAS VERY POSITIVE.
SHE HAD AN AMAZING ATTITUDE.
YEAH.
SHE DID TAKE A LOT.
THE SKINNY MIRROR
IS ALL ABOUT
MAKING PEOPLE FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THEMSELVES.
THE INTENTION
FOR THE RETAILERS TO BUY THEM
IS SO THAT
THEIR CUSTOMERS FEEL GOOD,
NOT TO DECEIVE THEM.
