HI. I'M J.D. CLARIDGE.
AND I'M CHARLES MANNING.
OUR COMPANY IS xCraft.
WE'RE LOOKING
TO SEEK $500,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR
20% OF THE COMPANY.
MUCH LIKE
WHEN THE WRIGHT BROTHERS
FIRST TOOK FLIGHT
IN 1903,
WE ARE WITNESSING
A NEW DAWN OF AVIATION --
THE AGE
OF UNMANNED FLIGHT.
THE X PlusOne
IS A DRONE REDEFINED.
WE'VE COMBINED BOTH THE HOVERING
PRECISION OF A HELICOPTER
AND THE FAST FLIGHT
OF AN AIRCRAFT.
YOU CAN SOAR AT SPEEDS
OF UP TO 60 MILES AN HOUR
AND CLIMB AS HIGH
AS 10,000 FEET.
Cuban: WHOA.
AND YOU CAN
SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION
FROM HIGH SPEED
BACK TO HOVER.
HOW COOL.
xCraft IS
BREAKING BOUNDARIES,
AND WITH YOUR HELP, THE SKY
WILL NO LONGER BE THE LIMIT.
J.D., HOW IS IT DIFFERENT
FROM ALL THE TRADITIONAL DRONES
I CAN BUY TODAY?
SO,
THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
IS THE ABILITY TO TRANSITION
TO FORWARD FLIGHT,
AND IT DOES THAT
WITH A WING.
THIS IS THE WING RIGHT HERE.
THIS MAIN AREA IS THE WING.
OKAY.
SO IT'S HOVERING,
AND THEN, WHEN YOU WANT TO GO
INTO FORWARD FLIGHT,
IT ROTATES LIKE THAT.
Greiner: OH.
OH, I SEE.
NOW IT'S AN AIRPLANE.
WHY DO I CARE, THE FACT THAT
I CAN GO SO MUCH FASTER?
YOU CAN CAPTURE A FAST-MOVING
SUBJECT LIKE A CAR,
OR, YOU KNOW, A MOTORCYCLE
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
John:
AND WHAT'S THE RANGE ON THIS?
BECAUSE, IF IT'S GOING
60 MILES AN HOUR,
CHARLES, AM I ALLOWED
TO CREATE A FLIGHT PLAN
FOR AN UNMANNED DRONE
AND JUST LET IT OUT THERE?
Manning: BINGO.
SO, WE CAN USE
OUR SMARTPHONES
FOR ALL DIFFERENT SORTS
OF THINGS TODAY.
[ LAUGHS ] THAT'S GREAT.
BUT NEVER HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO
ALLOW OUR SMARTPHONES TO FLY...
[ GREINER LAUGHS ]
...UNTIL NOW.
I LOVE THIS STUFF.
AND WE HAVE A LITTLE VIDEO
THAT WE CAN SHOW YOU.
SURE.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT.
OH, MY GOD.
OH. THAT IS SO COOL.
NOW, DO YOU USE
THE SENSORS IN THE PHONE
TO DO THE BALANCE
AND EVERYTHING?
EXACTLY.
WE DO, SO YEAH.
SMARTPHONES TODAY HAVE, YOU
KNOW, GYROS AND ACCELEROMETERS.
THEY'VE GOT GPS.
THEY'VE GOT -- A LOT OF THEM
HAVE VERY DECENT CAMERAS.
SO REALLY, THAT'S ALL THE
EXPENSIVE COMPONENTS IN A DRONE.
SO WE'VE LEVERAGED THEM,
BASICALLY TURNED A SMARTPHONE
INTO A DRONE.
HOW MUCH DOES THIS ONE
COST TO MAKE,
AND HOW MUCH
DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY
FOR SALE.
THIS IS IN DEVELOPMENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WILL COST?
WE'RE LOOKING AT AROUND
A PRICE POINT RETAIL OF $300.
J.D., ANSWER THIS FOR ME.
WHERE IS THE SECRET SAUCE
IN YOUR COMPANY?
LIKE, TELL ME WHAT
SOMEBODY CAN'T KNOCK OFF.
Manning:
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE I.P.
BEHIND THE DESIGNS.
THE I.P. BEHIND THIS DESIGN
IS UNIQUE.
THE I.P. BEHIND THIS
DESIGN IS UNIQUE AND,
ALSO, PATENT-PENDING.
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT
THERE IS COMPLETELY OPPORTUNITY
AROUND THE DESIGNS.
WE'RE GONNA LICENSE THIS THING
SILLY.
MUSIC TO MY EARS.
AND DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
OR THE CONTACTS
TO GO OUT
AND LICENSE YOURSELF?
WE DO.
SO, THEN, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHY ARE YOU HERE.
YOU'RE ASKING FOR $500,000.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA USE
THAT MONEY FOR?
$250,000
WE WOULD LIKE TO USE
FOR SCALING PRODUCTION
ON THE X PlusOne
TO GET OUR COSTS DOWN.
SO INVENTORY.
AND THEN
THE OTHER $250,000
IS TO FINISH DEVELOPMENT
OF PhoneDrone.
OKAY, WELL, LOOK --
BUT WHAT VALUE ADD
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
YEAH.
I'D LIKE
TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER.
I'D LIKE
TO START THINGS OUT HERE,
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
LOOKING AT THIS MARKET
QUITE A BIT
FOR THE LAST MONTH,
AND I THINK YOU HAVE
SOME ISSUES AROUND LICENSING
I COULD REALLY
HELP YOU WITH,
BUT I THINK YOU NEED
MORE MONEY.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $750,000
FOR 25%.
AND I WANT --
KEVIN COMING INTO
THE CUBAN ZONE.
NO ROYALTY, NO NOTHING?
NO, NO. THIS IS STRAIGHT EQUITY.
I WAS GONNA ASK THE SAME THING,
DAYMOND.
TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF
THESE DAYS.
O'Leary:
THIS IS A STRAIGHT EQUITY DEAL.
AND THE GRINCH'S HEART
GREW TWO SIZES THAT DAY.
I WANT TO OWN
A LITTLE BIT MORE EQUITY,
SO $750,000 FOR 25%.
WOW, GUYS.
Claridge: WOW. THANK YOU.
HE INCREASED YOUR VALUE
TO 3 MILLION BUCKS.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I SMELL?
I SMELL A NASTY, NASTY SHARK
FIGHT THAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
I'LL OFFER YOU $1 MILLION
FOR 25%.
I'LL RAISE MINE TO $1 MILLION,
AS WELL.
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION
FOR 20%.
WHAT?
BAM!
YEAH.
SO, YOUR VALUE JUST DOUBLED.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT.
I'LL DO THE SAME THING --
$1 MILLION FOR 20%.
WAIT.
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.
HANG ON. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
STEP OUT IN THE HALL.
YES, I THINK WE SHOULD ALL GO
STEP OUT IN THE HALL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BEFORE YOU STEP OUT
IN THE HALL,
WE CONTEMPLATED
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY,
AND IT'S
A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY.
WE BELIEVE EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT TEAMWORK.
THAT'S WHY
WE ARE A GOOD TEAM --
LET HIM TALK, LET HIM TALK,
LET HIM TALK.
NO, NO. I WANT TO DO A TEAM DEAL
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE IS
A BIG, NASTY, MONEY-BAG VULTURE
SOMEWHERE HERE, BEING QUIET.
[ LAUGHS ]
SO IF YOU GUYS WANT
TO TALK ABOUT DOING --
WELL, LET'S HEAR
WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY.
Manning:
HERE'S MY SUGGESTION.
IS THERE A CAPACITY
TO DO A SYNDICATE
WHERE WE GET EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF YOU PARTICIPATING
IN YOUR OWN UNIQUE WAYS?
OH,
I'M INTERESTED IN THAT.
I'M INTERESTED IN THAT.
Greiner: I'M INTERESTED IN THAT.
FOR WHAT VALUE?
THAT'S VERY RARE
IN THE SHARK TANK.
I NEED ENOUGH EQUITY
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
CHARLES, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
THAT DOLLAR IS
FOR YOU AND THE EQUITY?
SO...
SO, I THINK
A $10 MILLION VALUATION.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
GUYS, HOW DID YOU GO FROM
$2.5 MILLION TO $10 MILLION?
I SMELL GREEDY PEOPLE NOW.
Narrator: CHARLES AND J.D.
CAME INTO THE TANK
WITH A $2.5 MILLION VALUATION
FOR THEIR DRONE COMPANY, xCraft.
BUT WITH INTEREST
FROM FOUR SHARKS,
THEY'VE INCREASED THE COMPANY'S
VALUATION TO $10 MILLION.
I SMELL GREEDY PEOPLE NOW.
YOU KNOW, I USED TO TELL
MY DAUGHTERS THIS LITTLE STORY.
WHY DIDN'T THE BABY CRAB WANT
TO SHARE HIS FOOD?
Claridge: MM.
AND THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE
HE WAS JUST A LITTLE SHELLFISH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN'T COUNTER
FOR EVERYBODY HERE,
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS
WORTH MORE THAN $6 MILLION,
I DON'T BELIEVE.
SO HE --
THAT'S GOOD FEEDBACK.
HE GOT A CEILING,
AND THAT'S HELPFUL.
I THINK THAT CEILING FOR ME
IS 5%.
I GOT TO HAVE 5% MINIMUM.
THAT'S THE SMALLEST POSITION
I'VE GOT
IN ANYTHING THAT
I'M WORKING HARD ON.
YEAH.
SO, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUALIFYING QUESTION --
IS THERE ANY ONE OF YOU
THAT IS NOT INTERESTED
IN PARTICIPATING?
Manning:
OKAY, THAT'S HELPFUL.
HE HASN'T SAID.
WE'LL SEE.
[ LAUGHS ]
I THINK IT'D BE GOOD
TO CHAT, OKAY?
Claridge: LET'S STEP OUT.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
Herjavec: I JUST WANT YOU GUYS
TO BE CLEAR,
THERE'S A LOT OF
PRIVACY ISSUES.
THIS ISN'T A SLAM DUNK.
Manning:
IT'S YOUR CALL.
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY
TO GET THEM ALL.
AT A $6 MILLION VALUATION
FOR 25%, IF THERE'S FIVE OF US,
SIMPLE MATH, WE EACH HAVE
TO PUT UP $300,000.
MARK?
I DON'T KNOW.
John: WHAT'S YOUR RESERVATION,
MARK?
I DON'T KNOW. I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.
Manning:
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE EXCITED.
WE'RE MOSTLY EXCITED ABOUT
DOING SOMETHING TOGETHER.
OKAY. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO PROPOSE TO US?
WE DO.
YES. WE WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE
$1.5 MILLION,
EACH AT 5% EQUITY,
AND BRING ALL THE SHARKS IN.
YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP
25% OF THE COMPANY.
WE EACH PUT UP $300,000 FOR 5%,
25% TOTAL.
THAT GIVES YOU
A $6 MILLION VALUATION.
I'M OKAY WITH THIS DEAL.
I'M ONE SHARK.
I WOULD DO THAT DEAL.
I'M OKAY WITH THAT DEAL.
Claridge: FOR SURE.
OKAY.
YEAH.
AND SO,
WHEN SOMEONE'S COME TO YOU,
WHAT WERE THE DISCUSSIONS?
THERE'S REALLY TWO CATEGORIES
OF CONVERSATIONS.
ONE IS STRATEGIC, AND ONE IS
KIND OF PSEUDO-INSTITUTIONAL.
A LOT OF
THE INSTITUTIONAL GUYS
WANT TO KIND OF SHAPE IT LIKE
AN EARLY-STAGE V.C. STRUCTURE,
NOT SOMETHING WE'RE
AS EXCITED ABOUT DOING.
YOU ALL HAVE A LOT MORE
OPERATIONAL-EXECUTION
EXPERIENCE, RESPECTFULLY,
THAN MANY TRADITIONAL
EARLY-STAGE V.C. GUYS,
AND YOU ALSO COVER
A SPECTRUM.
YOU COVER A VARIETY
OF DIFFERENT AREAS,
WHICH IS REALLY USEFUL
TO THE BUSINESS,
'CAUSE THAT'S
THE WHOLE MODEL.
Herjavec: CHARLES,
I THINK THAT'S SO SMART.
I DEAL WITH A LOT OF V.C. GUYS,
LIKE WE ALL DO,
AND I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THEY'RE ALL SUPER SMART...
THEY ARE.
...THEY'RE ALL GREAT THEORY,
BUT THEY DON'T GET THEIR HANDS
DIRTY IN RUNNING BUSINESSES.
THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.
ALL RIGHT, MARK, ARE YOU IN?
Manning: WE SHOULD DO
A SPECIAL PARTY
WHERE WE DO
A LITTLE FLIGHT PARTY.
ABSOLUTELY.
WE GOT A SHARK TANK SYNDICATE.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
I'M EXCITED.
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
OWN THIS MARKET.
[ APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
WE'RE THRILLED.
O'Leary: ALL RIGHT.
[ LAUGHS ]
WELL-DONE.
Claridge:
I'M JUST AMAZED RIGHT NOW
THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY GOTTEN
A VALUATION THAT'S GREATER
THAN WHAT WE ASKED,
WE GOT MORE MONEY
THAN WHAT WE ASKED FOR --
THREE TIMES AS MUCH -- AND WE
GOT ALL FIVE SHARKS ON BOARD.
NICE JOB, FELLOW SHARKS.
Cuban: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
COOL. WE'RE IN
THE DRONE BUSINESS.
THAT IS COOL.
