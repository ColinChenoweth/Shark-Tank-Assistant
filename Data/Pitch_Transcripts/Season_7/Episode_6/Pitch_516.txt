MY NAME IS DANNY GROSSFELD
AND I'M FROM BAYSIDE, NEW YORK.
I GREW UP
IN A FAMILY OF ENTREPRENEURS.
MY FATHER RUNS A SUCCESSFUL
BANKRUPTCY AND LIQUIDATION
BUSINESS,
AND HE TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW.
LISTEN, I NEED HELP
SELLING THIS STUFF.
THE KEY TO MY DAD'S HEART
IS BUSINESS.
YOU MAKE A SALE
AND HE'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER.
A FEW YEARS AGO, I WENT TO JAPAN
ON A BUSINESS TRIP,
AND I CAME ACROSS
THIS AMAZING PRODUCT
WHICH I ABSOLUTELY
FELL IN LOVE WITH.
AS SOON AS I GOT HOME,
I DID MY RESEARCH
AND I FOUND OUT THAT IT'S
A $15 BILLION A YEAR BUSINESS,
AND MOST PEOPLE
HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH YOUR FUTURE?
[ SCOFFS ]
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET
A RICH GIRL?
THIS PRODUCT
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT I EVER CREATED ANYTHING
FROM SCRATCH,
AND I WANT TO MAKE
MY FATHER PROUD.
I'VE TAKEN IT
AS FAR AS I CAN ON MY OWN.
WITH A SHARK ON MY SIDE, I THINK
WE CAN GROW THIS BUSINESS
TO BE AS BIG AS IT IS IN JAPAN.
THIS PRODUCT IS HOT,
AND THE SHARKS
ARE GONNA LOVE IT.
HELLO,
MY NAME IS DANNY GROSSFELD,
AND I'M THE OWNER AND FOUNDER
OF HotShot.
I'M SEEKING $300,000
FOR 10% EQUITY IN MY COMPANY.
HotShot IS THE ULTIMATE
CONVENIENCE IN HOT COFFEE.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL IN A RUSH
IN THE MORNING,
AND WE CAN'T START OUR DAY
WITHOUT COFFEE.
THERE'S NO CHANCE YOU'RE GONNA
GET WHERE YOU NEED TO BE
ON TIME AND FULLY CAFFEINATED.
SO, STOP ALL THE RUSHING,
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE
OR WAIT IN LINE EVER AGAIN.
HotShot IS THE FIRST
GRAB-AND-GO, READY-TO-DRINK
HOT COFFEE IN A CAN.
THE MAGIC HAPPENS
WITH OUR HotBox.
IT'S A HOT FRIDGE
THAT HEATS AND STORES
HotShot CANS AT 140 DEGREES
24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK.
YOU JUST OPEN THE HotBox,
YOU REACH IN,
AND YOU GET A PERFECTLY PREPARED
HOT COFFEE
THAT'S READY TO DRINK
WHEN YOU ARE.
SO, JOIN THE COFFEE REVOLUTION
AND BECOME A HotShot.
GOT TO TRY IT.
BRING IT ON.
ABSOLUTELY.
LORI, WHAT KIND
DO YOU WANT?
THE CHOCOLATE.
OR THE FRENCH VANILLA.
EITHER.
ALL RIGHT,
THERE YOU GO.
OOH, IT'S WARM.
YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
AT 140 DEGREES.
REALLY?
ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD FEEL
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
WITHOUT AN INSULATED LABEL.
YOU CAN'T HOLD THE CAN
AT ALL.
OH, THE LABEL'S INSULATED.
ALL RIGHT, CHEERS,
EVERYBODY.
-IT'S OKAY.
-OOH, THAT'S PIPING HOT.
OH, THIS IS GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
DANNY, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH IT?
THIS IS ACTUALLY MODELED AFTER
A CONCEPT THAT COMES FROM JAPAN.
I WAS IN JAPAN,
AND I HAD JET LAG.
I'M ROAMING THE STREETS OF TOKYO
5:00 IN THE MORNING
DESPERATE FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.
AND I KEEP WALKING INTO
CONVENIENCE STORE
AFTER CONVENIENCE STORE
AND I COULDN'T FIND
ONE POT OF COFFEE.
SO, ABOUT, LIKE,
THE FIFTH OR SIXTH STORE
I GOT FRUSTRATED.
I SAID, "I'M JUST GONNA GET
AN ICED COFFEE."
AND I WALKED
TO THE BACK OF THE STORE
TO WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS A REFRIGERATOR,
I REACH IN,
AND ALL THE CANS WERE HOT.
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
THE REFRIGERATOR WAS BROKEN.
-A STAND-UP FRIDGE?
-THAT'S INTERESTING.
-YEAH.
-WAIT, IS THAT WHAT THAT IS?
Grossfeld: THAT'S WHAT THAT --
THESE ARE ALL HOT FRIDGES.
OH, MY GOSH.
[ CHUCKLES ]
FOR STORES.
THAT'S FOR A RETAIL STORE.
Herjavec:
DANNY, WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD?
IN THE TIME
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT,
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN DOING IT,
-WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD?
-THIS IS -- YOU READY?
THIS IS SIX YEARS, AND CLOSE
TO $2 MILLION IN THE MAKING.
Sacca: WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'VE SOLD $2 MILLION,
OR THERE'S $2 MILLION
GONE IN THE BUSINESS?
OH, NO, NO, NO.
$2 MILLION INVESTED
TO GET TO THIS POINT.
AND YOUR SALES ARE...?
I AM LAUNCHING THIS FALL.
IT TOOK THREE YEARS.
I WENT THROUGH OVER
1,500 DIFFERENT VARIATIONS.
I CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU'RE
PITCHING OR ASKING FOR THERAPY.
I BELIEVE
THAT ALL THE ANSWERS TO BUSINESS
COME FROM GREEK MYTHOLOGY.
OH, NO.
AND SO, THERE IS A VERY FAMOUS
FIGURE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY --
TO PUNISH A MAN
IN PERPETUITY...
[ LAUGHS ]
...WHAT HAPPENS
IS THAT HE FINDS HIMSELF
PUSHING A ROCK UP A MOUNTAIN
ONLY TO GET IT TO THE TOP,
AND FINDS HIMSELF
BACK AT THE BOTTOM AGAIN.
THAT'S YOU.
-[ LAUGHS ]
-WHY IS THAT?
AND HOW IS THAT
GREEK MYTHOLOGY?
AFTER SIX YEARS,
YOU'VE JUST CONTINUED TO PUSH
THE HotShot UP THE MOUNTAIN,
AND NO SALES WHATSOEVER.
WELL,
HE HASN'T STARTED SELLING.
WE'RE LAUNCHING.
WHERE DID YOU GET
THE $2 MILLION?
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
I PUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
INTO IT, MY FATHER'S HELPED ME.
HOW DID YOU SPEND
$2 MILLION IN THAT TIME?
IT WAS CLOSE TO $1 MILLION
JUST IN DEVELOPMENT.
-DANNY, DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT?
-YEAH, WHAT WERE YOU DEVELOPING?
PEOPLE...?
DEVELOPING THE BEVERAGE
SO THAT IT CAN SIT
ON CONSTANT HEAT
FOR UP TO FOUR MONTHS.
THE FORMULA.
EVERYTHING HAD TO BE TESTED.
SO, DANNY, HAVE YOU HAD
ANY CONVENIENCE STORES SAY,
"THIS IS AMAZING.
WE WANT IT"?
I HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST,
BUT NOBODY'S READY TO GIVE ME
SOME BIG P.O.
THEY ALL WANT TO TEST IT.
BUT THEY'RE WILLING TO COMMIT
TO DO A TEST?
YES.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
ONE OF THE ONES
THAT WERE MOST INTERESTED
WERE MOVIE THEATERS.
THEY HAVE A HUGE DEMAND
FOR COFFEE,
AND THEY CAN'T SATISFY IT.
I WISH SOMEBODY HERE OWNED
A MOVIE-THEATER CHAIN.
WHO COULD THAT BE?
JAPAN LAST YEAR,
HOT CANNED COFFEE
WAS A $15 BILLION
IN SALES.
WHAT?
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE
IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST
BEVERAGE CATEGORIES
NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF.
SIX YEARS WITH NO SALES
FOR AN ENTREPRENEUR
MAKES YOU START TO THINK,
"MAYBE I SHOULD TRY
SOMETHING ELSE."
I HAVE A RULE.
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY
IN 36 MONTHS,
YOU TAKE IT BEHIND THE BARN
AND YOU SHOOT IT,
'CAUSE IT'S A HOBBY.
IT'S NOT A BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
DANNY, AS YOU WERE TELLING
YOUR STORY, I'M THINKING,
"IF I REALLY WANTED A COFFEE,
WOULD I BUY THAT,
OR WOULD I KEEP DRIVING?"
AND PLUS, WHAT WE HAVE HERE
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE IN JAPAN
IS LOTS OF 24-HOUR
COFFEE SHOPS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
YEAH, THANK YOU.
-AND DANNY.
-YES, SIR?
MY WIFE, CRYSTAL,
IS MY INVESTING PARTNER,
AND SHE GOT US
INTO A LITTLE DEAL
OF A COFFEE COMPANY
CALLED BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE
-A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
-HEARD OF IT.
IT'S NOW GONE ON TO BE
THE FASTEST-GROWING COFFEE BRAND
IN THE COUNTRY.
I FEEL IT'S COMPETITIVE,
AND SO FOR THAT REASON, I'M OUT.
OKAY.
MARK AND LORI ARE LEFT.
DANNY,
I HAPPEN TO LOVE THE IDEA.
HATE THE BUSINESS.
BUT I LIKE YOU.
THANK YOU.
SO, EVEN THOUGH I'M GONNA SAY
I'M OUT ON THE DEAL,
ONCE YOU'RE SHIPPING,
IF YOU WANT TO PUT
ONE OF THE HOT COOLERS
INTO A LANDMARK THEATER,
WE'LL GIVE IT A TEST.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
HOW ABOUT THE STADIUM, TOO?
I THINK THAT'S A HOME FOR THAT.
[ LAUGHS ]
-DANNY!
-ONE STEP AT A TIME.
I'M SORRY.
I'LL TAKE THE LANDMARK.
THAT ROCK'S GONNA ROLL BACK DOWN
AND SQUISH YOU.
I'M BEING GREEDY, I KNOW.
THAT'S OKAY,
BUT YEAH, I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.
WELL, YOU GOT A CUSTOMER,
NOT AN INVESTOR.
-ONE SHARK LEFT. LORI.
-LORI.
OH, MY GOSH.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, HONESTLY,
IN "SHARK TANK" HISTORY,
I FEEL LIKE SAYING
THERE NEEDS TO BE SIX OUTS.
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT
IS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN
SO MANY TIMES WHERE SOMEBODY
SINKS A TON OF MONEY
INTO SOMETHING,
AND IN MY GUT, I FEEL LIKE
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
AND YOU JUST KEEP PUTTING IN
MORE AND MORE MONEY,
AND I FEEL LIKE SAYING YOU GOT
TO STOP THE BLEEDING SOMEWHERE.
NOT ONLY AM I SAYING
I AM OUT,
BUT I'M SUGGESTING
THAT YOU BE OUT, AS WELL.
NAH!
NO, I CAN'T GIVE UP NOW.
I'M GONNA LAUNCH THIS FALL.
-IT'S JUST MY OPINION.
-DANNY, DANNY.
WHETHER THE OTHER SHARKS
AGREE OR NOT.
-WE'LL TALK, DANNY.
-THANKS.
