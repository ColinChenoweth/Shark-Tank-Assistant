MY NAME IS MIKE DOYLE,
AND I'M THE C.E.O.
OF RENT LIKE A CHAMPION.
AND I'M DREW MITCHELL,
THE CO-FOUNDER
OF RENT LIKE A CHAMPION.
SHARKS, WE'RE HERE TODAY
TO ASK YOU FOR $200,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 10% OF OUR BUSINESS.
IMAGINE A CRISP FALL
FOOTBALL WEEKEND.
YOU'RE BACK AT YOUR ALMA MATTER
WITH YOUR FAMILY
AND YOUR TEAM JUST WON
BY A TOUCHDOWN.
WHOO!
YOU'RE RIDING HIGH
AND BASKING IN THE TRADITION.
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO PILE
THE KIDS INTO THE CAR,
FIGHT TWO HOURS OF TRAFFIC
TO DRIVE THE 15 MILES
BACK TO THE HOTEL
WHERE THE GROUP SPLITS UP
INTO THREE SEPARATE HOTEL ROOMS.
JUST LIKE THAT, YOUR FAMILY'S
GAME-DAY EXPERIENCE IS OVER.
[ SLIDE WHISTLE BLOWS ]
SHARKS...
-[ CHUCKLES ] STRONG.
-...NOT ANYMORE.
THANKS TO
RENT LIKE A CHAMPION,
WE SOLVED THAT PROBLEM
BY CONNECTING FANS
WITH THEIR OWN HOME
JUST STEPS FROM THE STADIUM.
LAST YEAR,
49 MILLION AMERICANS ATTENDED
A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME.
AND AN ESTIMATED
70% OF THOSE
NEED A PLACE TO STAY.
FANS LIKE THOSE
FLOCK TO OUR WEBSITE,
CHOOSE THE TOWN AND THE EVENT
THAT THEY'RE ATTENDING,
AND BOOK A WEEKEND RENTAL
MATCHING THEIR PRECISE CRITERIA.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY
EASY PROCESS.
AND SHARKS,
IT'S THE FOURTH QUARTER,
AND WE'RE READY
TO OFFER ONE OF YOU THE BALL.
NOW, WHICH ONE OF YOU IS READY
TO INVEST LIKE A CHAMPION?
WHAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND AIRBNB?
THE BIG DIFFERENCE --
WE FOCUS ON BIG EVENTS.
I CAN'T GO TO AIRBNB
AND RENT DURING A BIG EVENT?
YOU COULD.
YOU KNOW WHAT, PROBABLY NOT
IN SOUTH BEND, INDIANA,
-OR IN ANN ARBOR.
-WHY?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
THE INVENTORY THAT WE HAVE.
-BUT YOU ARE?
-WE'RE OPERATING
IN NON-TRADITIONAL
VACATION-RENTAL MARKETS,
SO WE'RE FINDING
THESE SMALL TOWNS
WHERE PEOPLE
AREN'T DOING THIS.
Herjavec: TELL ME
HOW YOU FIND THOSE HOMES
AND WHY THOSE PEOPLE WOULDN'T GO
TO AIRBNB AND THEY GO TO YOU.
SO, ON THE HOMEOWNER SIDE --
AGAIN, THIS IS A MARKETPLACE
THAT REALLY DOESN'T EXIST
IN THESE TOWNS,
SO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
THIS IS AN OPTION.
HOW DO YOU EDUCATE?
Doyle: SO, WE USE
DIGITAL MARKETING
TO TARGET THE EXACT ZIP CODES
NEAR THE STADIUM.
ONCE WE HAVE
AT LEAST 50 PEOPLE
INTERESTED IN LISTING
ON OUR SITE,
WE SEND ONE OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS
DOWN TO THESE TOWNS.
WE MEET WITH THEM
IN PERSON,
JUST LIKE A COACH
IN THE LIVING ROOM,
AND WE RECRUIT THEM
TO COME ON TO OUR SITE.
OH, WOW. SO, YOU'RE, LIKE --
YOU'RE IN THERE ONE BY ONE.
Sacca: I GOT TO BE HONEST,
IF I'M RENTING MY HOUSE OUT,
I'VE GOT MY FINGERS CROSSED THAT
FOOTBALL FANS DON'T RENT IT.
[ CHUCKLES ]
THEY'RE THERE FOR THE GAME.
THEIR TRASHED.
THAT'S A QUESTION
THAT WE'VE DEFINITELY HEARD.
WELL, BOTTOM LINE FOR ME,
EXACTLY BECAUSE OF WHAT
CHRIS SAID, I'M OUT.
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS KIND OF
THE SIZE OF THIS MARKET
AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
ACCOMPLISH SO FAR.
SO, LAST YEAR,
COLLEGE FOOTBALL FANS
SPENT $12 BILLION
SUPPORTING THEIR TEAMS.
OF THAT, $2.5 BILLION
WENT TOWARDS LODGING.
WE'VE PROCESSED
THROUGH OUR PLATFORM
$6.1 MILLION
WORTH OF RENTALS.
THAT HAS EARNED US
$1.4 MILLION IN FEES.
THAT'S VERY RESPECTABLE.
-WOW, MIKE, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-WHAT ABOUT THIS TRASHING ISSUE?
-I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.
SURE.
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OWNERS SAY,
"MY HOUSE GOT TRASHED.
EVERYTHING IN IT'S DESTROYED
AND EVERYBODY THREW UP
IN MY KITCHEN"?
CHRIS, I DID WANT TO TOUCH
ON THAT.
I WASN'T TRYING TO AVOID
THE SUBJECT.
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
THEY LEAVE IT IN PERFECT SHAPE
WITH A ROSE ON THE TABLE.
SO, WE HAVE PROCESSED
NEARLY 4,000 RENTALS
IN THE LIFETIME
OF THE COMPANY.
IN THOSE RENTALS,
THE INCIDENT RATE HAS BEEN 1.9%.
WHEN THERE IS AN INCIDENT,
THE AVERAGE CHARGE TO
SECURITY DEPOSIT HAS BEEN $98.
Sacca:
LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK STORY.
I MET THE AIRBNB GUYS
IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS
OF THEIR COMPANY,
AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO INVEST IN THAT COMPANY
AT JUST A FEW MILLION DOLLARS
VALUATION.
AND I ACTUALLY LET
THE NEGATIVE CASE CLOUD MY VIEW.
I LITERALLY WAS LIKE,
"SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET MURDERED
AND THE BLOOD
IS GONNA BE ON YOUR HANDS."
AND THAT COST ME
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS,
MAYBE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
THAT SAID,
IF THIS IS THAT BIG A MARKET,
YOU MUST HAVE COME UP
AGAINST THEM COMPETITIVELY.
ARE YOU SEEING THEM START
TO TARGET THIS SAME AUDIENCE?
NOT YET.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE REALLY
RIGHT NOW FOCUSED ON BIG CITIES.
AS DREW SAID, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA,
OR STATE COLLEGE, PENNSYLVANIA,
OR AUBURN, ALABAMA,
THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE A TON
OF INVENTORY IN THESE TOWNS.
AND THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING
IS IT'S A PROBLEM
ON BOTH SIDES.
SO, WE'RE GETTING FEES FROM THE
HOMEOWNER AND FROM THE RENTER.
AND WHAT DO YOU CHARGE
THE HOMEOWNER?
AND WHAT DO YOU CHARGE
THE RENTER?
THERE'S A 15% FEE
ON THE HOMEOWNER'S SIDE,
AND THERE'S AN 8% FEE
ON THE RENTER'S SIDE.
SO, WE'RE BUTTERING
BOTH SIDES OF THE BREAD.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND
THAT FOLKS THAT WE'RE SOLVING
THE PROBLEMS FOR,
THEY'RE KIDS
AND THEY'RE FAMILIES
AND IT'S AUNTS AND UNCLES
AND GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.
THEY'RE COMING BACK
TO THE CAMPUS.
THEY DON'T WANT TO STAY
IN MULTIPLE HOTEL ROOMS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE
GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
AND THEIR KIDS
ARE DOWN THE HALL
AND THEY DON'T GET TO PINCH
THE CHEEKS.
WE PUT THEM IN A HOME.
IT'S A WAY BETTER EXPERIENCE.
SLOW DOWN. I'M WORRIED YOU'RE
GONNA SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED
THE SOUTH BEND THING.
-I WENT TO A GAME LAST FALL.
-YEAH.
AND ALL THIS PASSION,
I SAW IT.
I ALSO HAD A HARD TIME
GETTING ENOUGH ROOMS
FOR ALL THE GUYS
I WENT DOWN WITH.
SURE.
HOW MANY LISTINGS
DO YOU HAVE IN SOUTH BEND?
SOUTH BEND
IS OUR BIGGEST MARKET.
WE'VE BEEN THERE
THE LONGEST.
WE HAVE 350 HOMES AVAILABLE
IN SOUTH BEND.
FOR BIG GAMES, WE'LL RENT OUT
80% TO 90% OF THOSE PROPERTIES.
TALK ABOUT THE GROWTH
IN THOSE LISTINGS.
SO, LAST YEAR, WE HAD ABOUT 200
HOMES IN SOUTH BEND.
THE REALLY COOL THING
ON THE HOMEOWNER'S SIDE
IS THAT PEOPLE START
TELLING THEIR FRIENDS
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MADE,
THEY'RE BRAGGING
TO THEIR CO-WORKERS,
AND WE'RE GETTING REFERRALS
LEFT AND RIGHT.
OUR BEST HOMEOWNER
IN SOUTH BEND LAST YEAR
HAS TWO HOMES NEAR CAMPUS.
HE PULLED IN $40,000
USING OUR WEBSITE.
WOW.
FROM HIM ALONE, WE'VE RECEIVED
DOZENS OF REFERRALS.
AND HAVE YOU RAISED
ANY MONEY?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
DREW, HOW MUCH DEBT
DO WE HAVE ON THE COMPANY?
ZERO!
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE RAISED
OUTSIDE FUNDS?
ZERO!
THIS HAS BEEN
TOTALLY BOOTSTRAPPED, GUYS.
WE'RE HAVING FUN
AND WE'RE MAKING MONEY.
AND MIKE, SALES THIS YEAR
ARE $1.4 MILLION.
WHAT WILL THEY BE NEXT YEAR?
WHAT ARE YOU PROJECTING?
SO, THAT WAS --
THE $1.4 MILLION IN FEES,
THAT WAS LIFETIME, OKAY?
SO, IN 2014, OUR SALES THROUGH
THE PLATFORM WERE $2.3 MILLION.
WE KEPT $530,000 OF THAT
IN OUR FEES.
OKAY.
IN 2015, WE'LL PROCESS
$4.13 MILLION IN TRANSACTIONS.
THAT WILL NET US $950,000
IN OUR FEES.
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
THAT AIRBNB SAYS, "LOOK --"
THEY JUST PUT
A SEPARATE TAB.
THEY'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE GOING
TO A COLLEGE GAME,
THIS IS THE PLACE
TO CHECK BECAUSE --
NO, AND HERE'S WHY.
BECAUSE THESE HOMES
ARE HARD TO SIGN UP.
YOU HAVE TO GO IN --
IN THESE TOWNS WHERE THEY'VE
NEVER HEARD OF THIS CONCEPT...
-I BUY IT, I BUY IT.
-...THE SHARING ECONOMY --
HOW MANY TOWNS ARE THERE
THAT ARE EVEN CLOSE
TO WHAT SOUTH BEND IS
IN TERMS OF RABID DEMAND?
THERE ARE 43 COLLEGE TOWNS
WHERE THEY AVERAGE
50,000 OR MORE PEOPLE PER GAME
IN ATTENDANCE.
WE'RE CURRENTLY IN 20.
WE'RE ASKING
FOR THE $200,000 INVESTMENT
TO GET INTO THE REMAINING 20
THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED
IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.
HOW DO YOU SPEND THE MONEY?
I GIVE YOU THE $200,000 --
SO, WE SPEND THE MONEY
ON DIRECT MAIL ADVERTISING,
AND THEN WE COUPLE THAT
SOMETIMES WITH RADIO ADS.
O'Leary:
LISTEN, I LIKE IT.
I'LL DO 200K FOR, UH, 15%
JUST 'CAUSE I LIKE TO NEGOTIATE.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I MEAN, I WOULD DO 200K
FOR THE 10%.
YES!
I THINK IT'S A NO-BRAINER
AT THIS VALUATION.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
THIS GUY'S GOT A BIG-TIME MAN
CRUSH ON YOU, BY THE WAY, SACCA.
I WAS DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH
LAST NIGHT.
[ Laughing ]
MAN CRUSHES LATELY.
-IT MUST BE THE BEARD.
-IT MUST BE.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I AM NOT OPPOSED TO LISTENING
TO WHAT THIS GUY MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DO IF HE'S INTERESTED AT ALL.
I DO THINK HE HAS SOMETHING
TO BRING TO THE TABLE.
I LIKE IT. LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO COMPETE WITH AIRBNB HEAD ON.
SURE.
BUT I DO THINK
THERE IS SOMETHING TO ADDRESSING
AN AUDIENCE THAT THOSE GUYS
HAVEN'T NECESSARILY GONE AFTER.
IF YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER
-AND JUST SPLIT IT, I'LL DO IT.
-YEAH.
YOU KNOW, REAL QUICK,
I WANT PEOPLE TO HELP --
YOU KNOW,
TO UNDERSTAND THE VISION.
MIKE'S TASKED RIGHT NOW --
YOU'RE LOOKING A GIFT HORSE
RIGHT IN THE MOUTH, RIGHT?
I'M NOT GONNA SCREW THIS UP,
MARK. I PROMISE YOU.
I JUST WANT EVERYBODY
TO UNDERSTAND --
JUST BE CAREFUL.
YOU LOOK A GIFT HORSE
IN THE MOUTH,
YOU MIGHT GET YOUR NOSE
BIT OFF.
HEY, I'LL SHUT IT UP.
WHEN I GET ADVICE LIKE THAT,
I KNOW WHEN TO STOP TALKING.
SO, WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?
SO, 10% TOTAL FOR 200K?
CORRECT.
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
-ALL RIGHT, WE GOT A PROVISION.
-GO NUTS.
WE'RE GONNA NEED BOTH YOU GUYS
TO COME TAILGATE WITH US.
-SOUTH BEND, INDIANA.
-OKAY.
-AND THEN WE GOT A DEAL.
-AND I THINK WE'RE GOOD.
HE'S GOING.
I AIN'T GOING.
YOU KIDDING ME?
I WENT TO INDIANA.
I HATE NOTRE DAME.
I THINK THE DEAL'S OFF.
WE'LL DOUBLE IT
WITH AN INDIANA BASKETBALL GAME.
I WOULD GET BACK
TO THE DEAL.
ALL RIGHT, WE WOULD LOVE
TO DO THE DEAL WITH YOU GUYS.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, GUYS.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS EXCITING FOR US.
YEAH, DREAM COME TRUE.
ALL RIGHT!
THANK YOU GUYS, BOTH,
VERY MUCH.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-CONGRATS, GUYS.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-I APPRECIATE IT, MAN.
-THANKS, MARK.
-THANKS, GUYS.
-THANK YOU, GUYS.
-YEAH, GREAT PITCH.
ALL RIGHT! YEAH!
OH, MAN!
TOUCHDOWN!
GOOD WORK.
Doyle: THIS IS EXACTLY
WHO WE WANTED TO DEAL WITH.
YOU KNOW, MARK HAS GOT
THE SPORTS WORLD COVERED.
EVERYTHING CHRIS TOUCHES
IN SILICON VALLEY TURNS TO GOLD.
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
WITH THE WAY THIS TURNED OUT.
CAN YOU GROW IT
BEYOND THAT
SO IT'S A TRUE COMPETITOR
TO AIRBNB?
WELL, I DON'T THINK SO.
I-I THINK IT'S A PICKUP
BY AIRBNB.
I THINK
IT'S THE KIND OF THING
THAT GETS ACQUIRED
BY THOSE GUYS.
WELL, YOU GOT TO PUT
PRESSURE ON THEM, YEAH.
AND LOOK, AT THAT VALUATION
WITH THAT KIND OF CASH FLOW
RIGHT NOW...
THERE'S NO DOWNSIDE.
...I THINK YOU CAN ONLY WIN
IN THAT DEAL.
