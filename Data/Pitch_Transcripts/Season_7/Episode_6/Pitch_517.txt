MY NAME RYAN FRAYNE,
I'M FROM PORTLAND, OREGON,
AND MY COMPANY
IS WINDCATCHER TECHNOLOGY.
AND I'M HERE TODAY
SEEKING $200,000
IN EXCHANGE
FOR 8% OF MY COMPANY.
NOW, ANYONE WHO'S TRIED
INFLATING AN OBJECT LIKE THIS
KNOWS WHAT A HUGE PAIN
IT CAN BE.
THEY TAKE FOREVER TO INFLATE.
AND YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR MOUTH
ON A VALVE.
-[ CHUCKLES ]
-YOU CAN SEE HERE
THAT AFTER I'VE BLOWN INTO
THIS CONVENTIONAL VALVE TWICE,
THIS BAG IS HARDLY INFLATED.
BUT WINDCATCHER
CHANGES ALL THAT.
WITH JUST A SINGLE
BREATH OF AIR,
I WAS ABLE TO INFLATE
THIS ENTIRE SHARK,
AND THIS IS BECAUSE WINDCATCHER
IS A RADICALLY DIFFERENT
INFLATION TECHNOLOGY
THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO INFLATE AN OBJECT THIS SIZE
IN SECONDS WITHOUT USING
ANY POWER OR PUMPING.
WOW.
AND WE'VE ALREADY INTEGRATED
THIS TECHNOLOGY
INTO OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT,
THE AirPad 2,
WHICH, LIKE ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS,
INFLATES AND PACKS UP
IN SECONDS.
-THAT'S AMAZING.
-YEAH.
BUT BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY
TO INFLATE,
I ALSO DESIGNED IT TO FOLD UP
AND DOUBLE AS A SEAT.
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE,
YOU CAN ATTACH THESE STRAPS
AND USE IT AS BOTH A SEAT
OR A PAD.
AND SHARKS,
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
THE APPLICATIONS
FOR WINDCATCHER'S TECHNOLOGY
ARE ENDLESS.
SO, LET ME ASK YOU.
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS READY TO HELP ME
BLOW AWAY THE COMPETITION?
RYAN, THAT WAS
REALLY IMPRESSIVE.
THANKS.
YOU'RE GONNA TELL US
HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?
SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS,
AND THE REASON IT'S DIFFERENT
THAN AN ORDINARY VALVE,
IS BECAUSE WE TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS PHENOMENON
CALLED ENTRAINMENT.
SO, IT'S ENTRAINING,
OR SUCKING IN,
THE SURROUNDING AIR.
SO, EACH TIME
I BLOW INTO THIS VALVE...
...IT'S ACTUALLY SUCKING IN
THE SURROUNDING AIR.
IT'S A STREAM OF FAST-MOVING,
LOW-PRESSURE AIR.
BRILLIANT.
SO, IT INFLATES 10 TIMES FASTER
THAN THE CONVENTIONAL VALVE.
WHAT PREMIUM DO I PAY
FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY
VERSUS ANY OTHER
AIR MATTRESS?
WE SELL OUR AirPad
FOR $99.95.
SO, ALL THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT
THAT IS FROM THE VALVE FORWARD.
OTHERWISE
IT'S A STANDARD AirPad.
EXCEPT WITH OUR ABILITY
TO FOLD IT UP INTO A SEAT.
SO, THEN, RYAN,
YOU HAVE A PATENT.
YES, IT'S A UTILITY PATENT.
ARE YOU AN ENGINEER?
NO, I DON'T HAVE A BACKGROUND
IN ENGINEERING.
I'VE JUST BEEN TRYING
TO INVENT STUFF FOR A LONG TIME,
AND OBVIOUSLY
THIS HAS BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL.
ENTRAINMENT IS --
IS PRETTY FANCY STUFF
THAT HASN'T BEEN INTRODUCED
TO A CONSUMER MARKET BEFORE.
HOW'D YOU STUMBLE UPON THIS?
I THOUGHT OF THE IDEA
AFTER A TRIP TO MY FAMILY
AT THE BEACH,
AND WE WERE ALL INFLATING
THOSE TERRIBLE, YOU KNOW,
POOL RAFTS WITH THOSE
TINY, LITTLE VALVES.
AND WHEN I GOT HOME
FROM PORTLAND,
I DID A BUNCH OF RESEARCH.
AND SO, I WAS SITTING
ON THE FLOOR OF MY APARTMENT,
AND SO I BLEW INTO THIS BAG,
BUT THIS TIME
I LEFT A LITTLE SPACE
BETWEEN ME AND THE BAG,
AND IT INSTANTLY INFLATED.
AND I WENT, "HOLY CRAP.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,"
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WENT ON GOOGLE,
AND WITH A BUNCH OF TRIAL
AND ERROR,
WAS ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THAT
IT WAS, IN FACT, ENTRAINMENT,
REFINED THE IDEA DOWN,
COME UP WITH THIS VALVE
AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS
THAT MAKE UP WINDCATCHER.
-VERY INTERESTING.
-SO, HOW LONG YOU BEEN DOING IT?
MAY 2013 IS WHEN WE DID
OUR KICKSTARTER.
WHAT'S THE REVENUE TODAY?
WHAT'S THE SALES
OVER THAT TIME?
$165,000.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A BUSINESS
AROUND A TECHNOLOGY
THAT'S PROPRIETARY,
AND ALL YOUR PRODUCTS
HAVE THIS WINDCATCHER
-INFLATION SCHEME TO IT.
-YEAH.
OR DO YOU WANT TO LICENSE IT
COUNTRY BY COUNTRY,
REGION BY REGION --
-BOTH?
-BOTH.
THERE ARE A TON OF PRODUCTS
THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE,
LIKE MEDICAL PRODUCTS.
AN INFLATABLE DONUT FOR A WOMAN
AFTER SHE'S GIVEN BIRTH,
-YOU KNOW, THEY USE THOSE...
-YES.
...I WOULDN'T
WANT TO MAKE THAT
'CAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR THE WINDCATCHER BRAND.
BUT THERE'S STILL POTENTIAL.
THERE'S STILL LOTS
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR LICENSING.
WHY IS THAT?
WELL, BECAUSE WINDCATCHER'S
ABOUT TRAVEL AND OUTDOOR GEAR.
WE DON'T MAKE, YOU KNOW,
HEMORRHOID PILLOWS
AND ATTACH OUR NAME TO THAT.
Herjavec:
RYAN, BREAK IT DOWN FOR ME.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE?
WHAT ARE YOU SELLING IT
WHOLESALE,
IF YOU HAVE ANY WHOLESALE?
I DON'T WANT TO REVEAL
MY COSTS,
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
MY MARGINS ARE 60%,
AND THAT'S SELLING
TO RETAILERS.
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO INVEST
IN YOUR BUSINESS
-IF YOU DON'T TELL US ANYTHING?
-YEAH.
I'M TELLING YOU
IT'S MARGINS OF 60%.
[ SCOFFS ]
SO, FIVE FIGURES,
SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE?
SIX FIGURES, SEVEN FIGURES?
WELL, IF IT WAS
A MILLION DOLLARS,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.
I WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.
OKAY.
SO, RYAN, YOU'RE EXPERIENCING
THE CHALLENGE
OF TRYING TO ROLL OUT
PHYSICAL INVENTORY,
BUILDING A BUSINESS.
IF THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS MERIT,
AND CLEARLY IT DOES,
I LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY
IN THE BUSINESS.
A LITTLE BIT OF
A MAD SCIENTIST GUY.
OKAY, GOT IT.
BUT THERE ARE VERY BIG PLAYERS
IN THE AIR MATTRESS BUSINESS.
OH, YEAH.
AND ONE STRATEGY
IS YOU'RE GONNA DISRUPT
THEIR BUSINESS
BY STEALING ALL THEIR SHARE...
YEAH.
...THEY'RE NOT GONNA LOVE YOU
AS MUCH AS THEY COULD.
SURE.
THEY COULD LOVE YOU
A LOT MORE IF YOU SIMPLY SAID,
"I'M GONNA CHANGE
THE MARKET FOR YOU.
I'M GONNA GO TO THE BIGGEST GUY,
I'M GONNA LICENSE THIS.
I WANT 80 CENTS, 60 CENTS,
WHATEVER IT IS,"
AND THEN YOU JUST STAY
IN YOUR APARTMENT ON THE PHONE,
AND A CHECK COMES
EVERY MONTH.
THAT'S CRAZY BORING.
I MEAN,
WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT
WHEN I CAN INVENT STUFF?
CHECKS IN THE MAIL
ARE CRAZY BORING?
YEAH.
ONCE YOU INVENT SOMETHING,
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT UP
AND HAVE SOMEBODY SCREW UP
HOW THAT GETS DEPLOYED
OUT INTO THE WORLD.
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S AN EITHER/OR.
-I THINK YOU CAN DO BOTH.
-I DON'T THINK SO, EITHER.
BUT I THINK YOU CAN DRIVE UP
THE ROYALTY SALES, EXACTLY,
-BY SELLING MORE.
-EXACTLY.
CLEARLY YOU'RE
A VERY INNOVATIVE GUY,
BUT BUILDING A BUSINESS
TO $10 MILLION, $20 MILLION,
$30 MILLION, $40 MILLION,
$50 MILLION,
IT'S A DIFFERENT SKILL SET.
MAYBE YOU HAVE IT,
MAYBE YOU DON'T. I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE A SINGLE GUY
IN THE BASEMENT RIGHT NOW.
SO, I'M GONNA STRUCTURE
AN OFFER TO YOU
THAT REFLECTS THAT RISK TO ME
AS AN INVESTOR, OKAY?
OKAY.
YOU NEED CAPITAL.
HOW MUCH DO YOU COVET
YOUR EQUITY?
EXTREMELY,
BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE
IT'S GONNA BE WORTH $50 MILLION
IN JUST THREE YEARS.
ALL RIGHT, SO I'M GONNA
STRUCTURE SOMETHING
THAT REDUCES
THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY I ASK FOR
-AND GETS YOUR CAPITAL.
-OKAY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
AS VENTURE DEBT.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
FOR 6% OF EVERYTHING YOU SELL
UNTIL YOU'VE RETURNED ME
$800,000, OKAY?
OKAY?
[ LAUGHS ]
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WOULD DO.
AND THEN IT GOES AWAY.
IT'S GONE.
AND I WANT 3% EQUITY
FOR PROVIDING THIS FACILITY.
YOU CAN COUNTER
IF YOU THINK THAT'S UNFAIR,
OR YOU MAY FIND A BETTER DEAL
AND GIVE UP MORE EQUITY.
-I DON'T KNOW.
-SURE.
SO, I'M QUADRUPLING THE AMOUNT
OF MONEY THAT YOU GIVE ME,
AND IN EXCHANGE,
YOU'RE KEEPING 3% OF MY COMPANY?
IS THAT RIGHT?
-[ LAUGHS ]
-YOU HAVE NO MONEY,
AND MAYBE ONE OF THESE SHARKS
WILL GIVE YOU THE MONEY,
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GIVE UP
8% OF YOUR COMPANY FOR IT --
OR MORE.
SO, HERE'S MY CONCERN,
KEVIN.
I'M ASKING FOR THE $200,000
BECAUSE I NEED TO USE IT,
AND YOU WANT ME TO START
PAYING YOU BACK IMMEDIATELY
AT THIS 6% ROYALTY.
DO YOU THINK
MONEY'S FREE, RYAN?
DO YOU THINK I JUST GIVE IT AWAY
'CAUSE I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT?
NO, I HOPE NOT.
I'M ASKING FOR RETURN.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S UNFAIR?
I THINK IT'S UNFAIR
FOR YOU TO ASK FOR ME
TO GIVE IT BACK RIGHT AWAY.
I'M ASKING BECAUSE I PLAN ON
USING IT
AND INVESTING IT
IN THE COMPANY.
WHY DON'T YOU COUNTER ME
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD DO?
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
TO JUMP IN WITH AN OFFER.
ALL RIGHT, RYAN,
I'LL GIVE YOU AN OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000.
OKAY.
BUT I WANT 15%.
OKAY.
OUCH.
THAT SOUNDS EXPENSIVE,
LORI.
WELL, I THINK YOU NEED
A LOT OF HELP.
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A ONE-MAN BAND.
YOU NEED TO BE MAKING
A LOT OF OTHER PRODUCTS
WITH THIS GREAT
TECHNOLOGY.
THAT'S WHAT
I'M REALLY GOOD AT,
BUT IT'S GONNA REQUIRE ME
TO BE THERE HELPING YOU
AND ALSO HELPING WITH THE SALES
AND GETTING INTO THE RETAIL.
I LOVE HOW YOU WRITE
ON YOUR HAND.
-I DO THAT, TOO.
-YEAH, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO --
[ Laughing ]
I WRITE ON MY HAND.
YEAH, THAT'S NOT --
THAT'S NOT STRANGE AT ALL.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL
NERVOUS AT ALL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Sacca: HEY, LORI, DO YOU HAVE
SOME ROOM IN YOUR DEAL?
BECAUSE I THINK
I COULD BRING
A COMPLEMENTARY
SET OF STRENGTHS TO THIS DEAL.
I'M VERY INTRIGUED
BY THE TECHNOLOGY.
I DO KNOW IT SOLVES
A REAL PAIN POINT.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU REALLY NEED HELP WITH
IS TELLING THE STORY
ABOUT THE NEXT DOZEN PRODUCTS.
WE HAVE TO DEVELOP
THE PROTOTYPES
THAT SHOW HOW MIGHT IT BE USED
IN A MEDICAL SETTING,
HOW MIGHT IT BE USED IN
A RECREATIONAL RAFTING SETTING
-AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.
-RIGHT.
I WOULD LOVE TO COME IN
AND SEE PART OF THAT DEAL
IF IT'S AVAILABLE.
I WOULD BE WILLING
TO JOIN IN WITH YOU, CHRIS,
AS YOU TAKE THE LICENSING END
AND I TAKE THE CONSUMER END.
BUT FOR BOTH OF US TOGETHER,
WE WOULD NEED
A HIGHER EQUITY STAKE.
-I HEAR THAT.
-OUCH.
WE'D NEED A LITTLE HIGHER
PERCENTAGE.
BUT REMEMBER SOMETHING,
YOU NOW WOULD BE
A THREE-MAN BAND,
TWO BEING SHARKS,
WHICH THAT'S HUGE.
YOU JUST DON'T OWN
ANY OF YOUR COMPANY ANYMORE.
WHAT'S THE OFFER, THEN?
I'M HAPPY TO SPLIT IT WITH YOU.
20%.
-OUCH!
-FOR 200K.
-FOR 20%?
-OUCH.
I CAN'T --
I WOULDN'T DO THAT DEAL
BECAUSE WE'VE GOTTEN
GUARANTEED ROYALTY DEALS
THAT I TURNED DOWN
THAT WERE FOR OVER $2 MILLION
OF GUARANTEED ROYALTIES.
RYAN, I LOVE THE PRODUCT.
AND I LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT ODD.
ODD PEOPLE MAKE
GREAT THINGS, RIGHT?
THANKS.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $200,000 FOR 10%.
I LIKE THE FACT
YOU'RE BRINGING IT OUT TO MARKET
'CAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU GET
A BETTER LICENSING DEAL
LATER ON.
WELL, WE'LL DO THE 15%.
SO, $200,000 FOR 15%?
I'LL DO THAT DEAL.
NOW, IF YOU HAVE TO WRITE
THAT DOWN,
YOU'RE GONNA RUN
OUT OF HAND SPACE.
YEAH, I KNOW.
AND YOU'LL LEARN WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT TO TRAVEL WITH PAPER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOURS IS $200,000 FOR 10%.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO ALSO INCLUDE
A $10 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT
FOR PURCHASING ORDERS
AT THE PRIME INTEREST RATE?
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GIVE UP
ALL THE EQUITY DAY ONE?
I'LL DROP MY ASK DOWN TO 2%
JUST TO KEEP IT INTERESTING.
YEP.
GET THAT PAPER OUT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000,
10%, BACK THE PURCHASE ORDERS.
WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?
BECAUSE I CAME IN HERE
WITH A VALUATION
THAT I BELIEVED WAS FAIR --
MORE THAN FAIR.
OKAY, SO RYAN,
IF I GIVE YOU $200,000 FOR 8%,
BACK UP YOUR PURCHASE ORDERS,
DONE DEAL, RIGHT?
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A REALLY GOOD DEAL.
OR IF I GIVE YOU 200K --
NO, IT'S EITHER YES OR NO 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
-...WITH CHRIS FOR 8% --
-RYAN, IT'S WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
-IT IS.
-ACROSS THE BOARD.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
FOR 6.5%.
REALLY?
THE EQUITY'S
REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU.
YES.
LOOK, WHAT'S 1.5% TO ME
IF THIS THING GOES
TO WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO?
IT WILL.
RYAN, I'LL DROP MY ASK
DOWN TO 1%.
I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED,
THE $200,000 --
RYAN, I GAVE YOU MORE
THAN YOU WERE ASKING FOR.
I'LL GIVE YOU --
JUST GIVE ME 1% OF THE COMPANY.
-I WANT TO HEAR THE ANSWER.
-I'LL GIVE YOU $200,000, 6.5%.
IT'S MORE THAN YOU CAME IN HERE
ASKING FOR.
COME ON, RYAN.
Greiner:
I JUST CHANGED MY DEAL.
LORI, LET HIM GET --
I'M GONNA DO --
NO, I'VE CHANGED MY DEAL.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $200,000
FOR 5%.
CHRIS ISN'T IN THE DEAL.
JUST ME.
BUT YOU NEED
TO JUST SAY YES NOW.
AND I'LL FUND
THE PURCHASE ORDERS.
JUST YOU AND ME.
-$200,000 FOR 5%.
-MM-HMM.
LEFT AT THE ALTAR.
[ LAUGHS ]
OKAY. LET'S DO IT.
OH, MY GOD.
-SORRY, CHRIS.
-GOOD FOR YOU, LORI.
FELLOW INVENTOR.
FELLOW INVENTOR.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE GOT WORK TO DO.
-AWESOME.
-THANK YOU.
-CONGRATS.
-THANKS, GUYS. THANK YOU.
-THAT'S AWESOME.
-THANKS.
O'Leary: CHRIS, LORI JUST
THREW YOU UNDER A BUS.
SHE DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT YOU!
IT WENT TOO LOW.
I'M SORRY.
WELCOME
TO THE SHARK TANK.
Frayne: I'M DEFINITELY
STILL PROCESSING WHAT HAPPENED.
I'M STILL FREAKING OUT.
WITH THE DEAL I GOT TODAY
WITH LORI,
I BELIEVE IT'S GONNA ALLOW ME
TO MOVE WINDCATCHER
IN THE DIRECTION THAT I FEEL
THE COMPANY CAN GO.
Narrator: LAST SEASON,
LYDIA EVANS FAILED TO SECURE
A DEAL IN THE TANK
FOR HER LOOFAH SOAP COMPANY
S.W.A.G. ESSENTIALS.
THIS BAR ALLOWS A GUY
TO CLEANSE, EXFOLIATE,
AND DISINFECT
THE SURFACE OF HIS SKIN.
ARE YOU MAKING THIS
YOURSELF?
I MAKE IT FROM MY HOME.
OH, YOU MAKE IT
IN YOUR HOME?
FROM YOUR HOME?
I THINK IT'S REALLY A HOBBY
AT THIS POINT.
BUT I AM GONNA GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER.
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN I WILL BE SINGLE.
[ Chuckling ] OH, MY GOD.
Narrator:
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE'S UP TO NOW.
Evans: EVERYONE GOES
ON "SHARK TANK" WANTING A DEAL.
I DIDN'T WALK AWAY WITH A DEAL.
WHAT I DID GET
WAS A CRASH COURSE IN BUSINESS.
MORNING.
I TOOK THE ADVICE THAT
THE SHARKS GAVE ME TO HEART,
AND IT HAS CHANGED THE DIRECTION
OF MY BUSINESS DRAMATICALLY.
THE FIRST THING I DID
WAS RETHINK MY WEBSITE
BECAUSE OF ROBERT'S ADVICE.
I TOOK LORI'S ADVICE
AND EXPANDED MY PRODUCT LINE.
I ADDED THE S.W.A.G. BAR LITE
FOR THOSE WITH ACNE
AND THE GYNGERELLA BAR
FOR WOMEN.
BUT THE BIGGEST CHANGE
IS THAT I WAS ABLE TO TAKE
MY BUSINESS
OUT OF MY TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT
INTO A 3,000-SQUARE-FOOT
PRODUCTION FACILITY.
THAT'S THE MAGIC TOUCH
RIGHT THERE.
WHEN I PITCHED, I ONLY HAD
ABOUT $54,000 IN SALES.
IN THE SIX MONTHS
SINCE APPEARING ON "SHARK TANK,"
I'VE DONE OVER $340,000
IN SALES.
I'M IN TALKS
WITH CVS AND RITE AID
AND HOPING TO MAKE A DEAL
WITH BIG-BOX STORES SOON.
THAT'S THE NEXT STEP.
WE NEED TO GET AT LEAST
ANOTHER 150 ORDERS OUT.
CAN WE DO IT, PLEASE?
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!
MY "SHARK TANK" EXPERIENCE
HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S GO AHEAD AND
GET THESE ON THE TRUCK HERE.
WHAT STARTED
AS A KITCHEN-TABLE EXPERIMENT
HAS NOW BECOME
A FULLY LEGITIMATE BUSINESS,
AND I CAN SEE THIS
BECOMING SOMETHING HUGE.
SO SHARKS, IF YOU LIKE
WHAT YOU SEE, CALL ME,
ESPECIALLY YOU, DAYMOND.
[ LAUGHS ]
Narrator: NEXT UP IS A BUSINESS
DESIGNED TO INSPIRE
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS.
