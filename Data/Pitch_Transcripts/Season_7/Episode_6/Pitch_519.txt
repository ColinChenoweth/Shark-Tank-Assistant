Lavanya: WE'RE HUGE NERDS,
AND WE ARE NERDS
THAT WANT TO SHARE THAT PASSION
WITH OTHER STUDENTS.
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS READY
TO INVEST LIKE A CHAMPION?
IF THE SHARKS HEAR A GREAT IDEA
THEY'LL INVEST
THEIR OWN MONEY...
I LOVE THE PRODUCT.
ODD PEOPLE MAKE GREAT THINGS.
...AND FIGHT EACH OTHER
FOR A DEAL.
WE'D LOVE TO WORK
WITH BOTH OF YOU.
I'M WILLING TO SHARE.
YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE BECAUSE
YOU'RE SWIMMING IN MY WAKE.
OH, WOW.
BUT THE ENTREPRENEURS
MUST GET THE FULL AMOUNT
THEY'RE ASKING FOR, OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
-WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
-ZERO!
I CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU'RE
PITCHING OR ASKING FOR THERAPY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $200,000
AS VENTURE DEBT.
WE WOULD LOVE
TO CONSIDER IT.
YOU'RE LOOKING A GIFT HORSE
RIGHT IN THE MOUTH.
I'M NOT GONNA SCREW THIS UP,
MARK.
I CAME IN HERE WITH A VALUATION
THAT I BELIEVED WAS FAIR.
DO YOU THINK MONEY'S FREE?
DO YOU THINK I JUST GIVE IT AWAY
'CAUSE I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT?
-SO, WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS A WAY TO OPTIMIZE
THE EXPERIENCE OF ROOTING
FOR YOUR HOME TEAM.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS MELISSA JAWAHARLAL.
AND I'M LAVANYA.
Both: WE ARE SISTERS
AND CO-FOUNDERS...
...OF S.T.E.M. CENTER USA.
WE'RE HERE TODAY
SEEKING $150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
JUST HOW THE ABCs
ARE THE BASIS OF COMMUNICATION,
ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
ARE THE FOUNDATION
OF OUR MODERN LIFE.
CAN YOU IMAGINE OUR WORLD
WITHOUT CELLPHONES, CARS,
OR THE INTERNET?
WHILE WE'VE BECOME
MORE DEPENDENT ON TECHNOLOGY
EVERY DAY,
FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE
SEEM TO HAVE
EVEN A BASIC UNDERSTANDING
OF HOW THINGS WORK.
THAT'S WHY WE CREATED
S.T.E.M. CENTER USA.
S.T.E.M. STANDS FOR
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, AND MATH.
WE SET UP
A CREATIVITY CENTER
FOR STUDENTS FROM 5 YEARS OLD
ALL THE WAY UP TO COLLEGE
TO LEARN HOW TO DESIGN,
BUILD, AND PROGRAM.
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY
TO EXCITE THE NEXT GENERATION
OF S.T.E.M. LEADERS
AND BRING A S.T.E.M. CENTER
TO A LOCATION NEAR YOU?
WOW, YOU'RE SO, LIKE,
RIGHT ON.
Greiner: SO IN SYNC.
SO YOU GUYS TALK
LIKE THAT NORMALLY?
YES, PRETTY MUCH.
WE DO.
WE ARE SISTERS.
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
SURE. SO, I'M --
I JUST TURNED 21 YEARS OLD.
I'M GOING INTO MY SENIOR YEAR
AT U.C. BERKELEY,
AND I'M STUDYING
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.
I AM --
JUST TURNED 23 YEARS OLD.
I GRADUATED WITH A FULL
SCHOLARSHIP FROM U.S.C.
STUDYING MECHANICAL
ENGINEERING.
DURING MY TIME AT U.S.C.,
I ALSO WORKED ON TWO CURRENTLY
ORBITING SATELLITES.
I SERVED AS A DESIGN LEAD.
AND PRIOR TO JOINING
THE CENTER FULL TIME,
I ALSO WORKED AT A DEFENSE --
MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT,
TELL US ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
SO, WE ARE A SUPPLEMENTAL
EDUCATION PROGRAM.
OUR CREATIVITY CENTER
IS BASED IN POMONA, CALIFORNIA.
WE HAVE 85 STUDENTS
AT OUR CENTER.
75 OF THOSE STUDENTS
ARE YEARLY MEMBERS.
FIVE OF THEM
PAY MONTHLY,
AND THE REST ARE INTRODUCTORY
SIX-WEEK STUDENTS.
HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY
ANNUALLY?
OUR ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS
RANGE FROM $1,400 TO $1,800
DEPENDING ON THE CLASSES.
DANG, $1,400?
FOR A YEARLY MEMBERSHIP.
WHAT'S THE MONTHLY?
THEY PAY AN AVERAGE OF $135
ON A MONTHLY BASIS.
IN ADDITION, WE ALSO OFFER
AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS
TO LOCAL SCHOOLS.
WHAT'S REVENUE GONNA BE
THIS YEAR?
WE HAD $300,000 IN REVENUE
LAST YEAR.
THIS WAS BROKEN
INTO TWO REVENUE STREAMS.
WE HAVE OUR CREATIVITY CENTER.
THIS BROUGHT IN $130,000.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, AS WE
WERE WORKING WITH STUDENTS,
WE IDENTIFIED GAPS IN THE MARKET
FOR ROBOTICS TOOLS.
SPECIFICALLY,
WE CREATED A ROBOTIC PRODUCT
FOR UPPER MIDDLE SCHOOL
AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.
IS THAT THE BOX THERE?
WE RAN KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGNS --
CORRECT --
THAT BROUGHT IN
$170,000 IN SALES.
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER THIS
FROM KICKSTARTER.
-IT WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL.
-YOU DO?
Sacca: WELL,
I'M A KICKSTARTER INVESTOR,
SO I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION
TO THE STUFF
THAT INFLECTS THERE,
AND THIS GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION.
LOOK, I'M LOOKING AT THIS THING
WITH A LOT OF MOVING PARTS,
A LOT OF SPOKES ON IT,
AND I DON'T THINK
THE WHEEL'S TURNING YET
IN FULL CIRCLE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY,
AND I DON'T REALLY SEE WHAT
DIRECTION YOU'RE GONNA GO YET.
I WOULD'VE PREFERRED IF THIS
HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE GELLED
SO THAT I COULD'VE SEEN
SOMETHING
I COULD JUST POUR
MY GASOLINE ONTO
IN THE FORM OF CAPITAL
TO EXPAND IT.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THERE YET.
I THINK IT'S WAY TOO EARLY FOR
AN INVESTOR, AT LEAST FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MR. WONDERFUL,
FOR YOUR THOUGHTS.
LOOK, IT MAY NOT MATTER TO THIS
SOULLESS CAPITALIST OVER HERE,
BUT I'M RAISING A COUPLE OF
GIRLS, AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M IN AN INDUSTRY
THAT'S JUST DOMINATED BY MEN.
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY
IS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF WOMEN.
AND SO, I'M CURIOUS.
I GET A HINT THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING REALLY DEEPLY
MISSION-DRIVEN
BEHIND YOU GUYS.
WE ARE HUGE NERDS,
AND WE ARE NERDS
THAT WANT TO SHARE THAT PASSION
WITH OTHER STUDENTS.
SPECIFICALLY FOR GIRLS --
YOUNG GIRLS THAT GET TOLD
BEING NERDY ISN'T COOL,
WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT,
AND THAT STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.
MELISSA, YOU -- YOU GUYS
ARE INCREDIBLY POLISHED,
BUT I SEE A LOT OF WORK,
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S AS EASY
TO SCALE AS, UH...
AS I WISH IT WAS.
LOOK, I'M EXCITED
ABOUT YOU GUYS.
I'M NOT AS EXCITED
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
Cuban:
GUYS, YOU WANT TO GROW,
AND YOU HAVE
THIS MAGNIFICENT GOAL.
BUT YOU'RE -- YOU'RE A LITTLE
BIT TOO OPEN-ENDED FOR ME.
I THINK TAKING THOSE FIRST STEPS
ARE GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT
AND REQUIRE
A LOT OF HAND-HOLDING.
I STILL THINK
YOU'LL BE SUCCESSFUL.
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S THE RIGHT FIT FOR ME,
SO FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, MR. CUBAN.
YOU STILL HAVE TWO SHARKS.
YOU'VE GOT LORI
AND YOU'VE GOT CHRIS.
FOR ME, I THINK
A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES HERE
REALLY GO BACK
TO VALUATION,
BECAUSE THIS IS A BUSINESS
THAT DOESN'T HAVE
THE TRADITIONAL SCALE
OF A TECH COMPANY.
THAT SAID, I DEEPLY
BELIEVE IN YOUR MISSION.
I THINK SCHOOLS ARE GONNA
START WAKING UP AND REALIZING
THEY NEED MORE OF THIS
IN THE SCHOOLS.
THEY'RE GONNA BE
REACHING OUT TO YOU.
THERE IS A BIG THIRST
FOR MATERIALS LIKE THIS.
SO, WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO
IS OFFER YOU 150K
FOR 25% OF THE COMPANY.
I DO HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT
FOR THAT OFFER
AND WE DO APPRECIATE IT,
AND WE WOULD LOVE
TO CONSIDER IT.
WE DO BELIEVE --
[ LAUGHTER ]
WOW. [ LAUGHS ]
MELISSA, DO YOU NEED
TO CONSIDER IT?
WE DO BELIEVE THAT
A $1 MILLION VALUATION IS FAIR.
SO, HOW DO I GET
THAT MONEY BACK, THEN?
WHEN IS THIS THING -- YOU KNOW,
ARE YOU GONNA SELL THIS?
DOES IT GET BOUGHT BY --
BY SOME MASSIVE CONGLOMERATE?
I MEAN, WHERE DO WE GET
THAT MONEY BACK?
SO, OUR PROJECTIONS
FOR THIS YEAR IS $450,000.
FOR OUR 2016 PROJECTION,
WE ARE LOOKING
AT $3.2 MILLION IN SALES.
SO, IF YOU'RE INVESTING
$150,000 FOR 25%,
YOU WANT YOUR $150,000 BACK
WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO.
-AND SO, IF YOU --
-NOT NECESSARILY.
I MEAN, I'VE OWNED TWITTER STOCK
SINCE 2007
AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S GONE UP
A LOT SINCE I INVESTED.
I'VE OWNED UBER STOCK
SINCE 2009.
THAT'S GONE UP A LOT.
I DON'T NEED MY MONEY BACK
IN A YEAR AND A HALF.
I HAVE THE MONEY TO SPARE.
THAT SAID, I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE TERMINAL EVENT IS
FOR THIS COMPANY.
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE EXIT IS.
THERE ARE CERTAIN FOUNDERS
WHO WILL NEVER SELL,
AND AS AN EQUITY INVESTOR,
THAT'S A BUMMER
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET
THAT MONEY BACK
AND MORE AT SOME POINT.
OUR VISION
IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS ITSELF
IS TO HAVE A S.T.E.M. CENTER
IN EVERY CITY.
AS WE GROW,
IF WE ARE ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO'S INTERESTED
TO TAKE THAT FORWARD,
ABSOLUTELY
WE WOULD BE INTERESTED.
Herjavec: MELISSA, DO YOU HAVE
A COUNTER FOR CHRIS?
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE.
Narrator:
THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
CHRIS HAS MADE AN OFFER,
BUT LORI MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED
IN MELISSA AND LAVANYA'S
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, AND MATH
EDUCATION COMPANY,
S.T.E.M. CENTER USA.
Herjavec: MELISSA, DO YOU HAVE
A COUNTER FOR CHRIS?
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHARE.
HERE'S THE THING.
I'D LIKE TO HEAR A COUNTER
BECAUSE I LOVE LORI,
AND I HAVE DEEP RESPECT FOR HER
QVC AND RETAIL CONNECTIONS,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
AND SO, I THINK I HAVE
A UNIQUE SKILL SET
TO BRING TO THE TABLE
WITH YOU GUYS,
AND SO I'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE COMING BACK WITH.
-I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING.
-OH, COME ON.
A PERSONAL ANECDOTE ABOUT
WHAT S.T.E.M. MEANS TO YOU?
-'CAUSE I WOULD LISTEN TO THAT.
-[ LAUGHS ]
I'D LISTEN TO THAT.
ABOUT A ROBOT YOU BUILT
WHEN YOU WERE 8 YEARS OLD?
-I WOULD TOTALLY HEAR THAT OUT.
-JUST LIKE KEVIN...
-OH, MY GOODNESS.
-COME ON.
JUST LIKE KEVIN,
I'M PART OF A VERY EXCLUSIVE
AND PRESTIGIOUS CLUB.
I'M A WOMAN.
I SEE IN YOU GUYS SOMETHING
THAT I THINK
IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT
TO WOMEN.
I THINK BOTH OF YOU
ARE EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE.
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
I LIKE THE CONCEPT,
AND I LIKE WHAT IT WILL DO
FOR YOUNG WOMEN.
SO, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER,
BECAUSE I THINK
THE THREE OF US TOGETHER
WILL BE VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL.
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
$150,000 FOR 20%.
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MS. GREINER.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO GET AN OFFER
FROM YOU, AS WELL.
WE ARE HERE
TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, AND --
WHAT PROBLEM
ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE?
WHAT DO YOU NEED
FROM A SHARK?
WE NEED ASSISTANCE
IN EXPANDING THE CENTER
THROUGH FRANCHISE,
AND WE NEED
THAT CAPITAL INVESTMENT
TO DO THE DOCUMENTATION
TO TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
THAT'S WHAT'S RESTRICTING US
FROM DUPLICATING CURRENTLY.
SO, WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY
IS, "I NEED A SPOT ON QVC.
I NEED AN INFOMERCIAL.
I NEED AN END CAP
AT A BED, BATH &amp; BEYOND."
THAT'S NOT ALL THAT I DO.
THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU GUYS KNOW THAT.
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.
Melissa: BOTH OF YOU OFFER
A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS.
WE HAVE A PRODUCT LINE,
WE HAVE A CENTER.
WE ARE WORKING TO EXPAND BOTH,
AND I KNOW THAT BOTH OF YOU
CAN HELP US WITH THAT.
WHAT WE'D LOVE TO DO
IS WORK WITH BOTH OF YOU.
I'M WILLING TO SHARE BECAUSE
I SEE MERIT TO BOTH OF US.
I SEE
WHERE I CAN TAKE IT,
BUT I ALSO THINK
THAT CHRIS CAN BRING MERIT.
IF CHRIS IS WILLING
TO ACCEPT MY HAND BACK IN.
LOOK,
YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE
BECAUSE YOU'RE SWIMMING
IN MY WAKE.
NO.
YOU'RE RIDING MY COATTAILS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN BRING.
THAT'S NOT WHY
I'M WILLING TO SHARE.
IT'S FREE MONEY FOR LORI.
AND SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE.
OH, WOW, WOW.
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THE EQUITY'S
GONNA BE WORTH MONEY.
AND I DON'T WANT TO SHARE IT.
I WANT IT TO BE WORTH MY TIME.
AND SO I WANT TO HAVE
A BIG ENOUGH COMMITMENT
TO THE COMPANY
THAT WHEN YOU GUYS CALL,
I GET THAT MUCH MORE EXCITED
WHEN WE ULTIMATELY DO SELL THIS
FOR A BILLION DOLLARS.
I WANT TO HAVE SOME SKIN
IN THE GAME.
I WANT TO OWN
A LOT MORE OF THIS COMPANY.
MY OFFER, I'LL REPEAT --
IT'S $150,000 AT 20%,
AND I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU SIDE
BY SIDE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
CHRIS, WHAT WAS YOUR
FINAL OFFER?
I'LL COME DOWN TO 150K
FOR 22.5%.
WOULD EITHER OF YOU DO
$200,000 FOR 20%?
I WOULD.
LORI, WE'D LOVE TO WORK
WITH YOU.
WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU,
LORI.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. SACCA.
-WHOA.
-OKAY, CHEERS.
Melissa:
WE DIDN'T TAKE CHRIS' OFFER
BECAUSE LORI
GAVE US AN OFFER
WITH ABSOLUTELY NO HESITATION
AND 200% BELIEF IN WHAT WE DO.
TO WORK WITH A FEMALE
LIKE LORI,
WHO IS SUCH
A STRONG ROLE MODEL --
IN TECH, IN SALES,
IN EVERYTHING -- IS A DREAM.
