HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS GABE WOLFF.
-ABSOLUTELY.
-GABE, I HAVE BAD NEWS FOR YOU.
-YEAH?
-I AM AN ICE CREAM EXPERT.
-UH-OH.
-UH-OH.
NOBODY EATS MORE
ICE CREAM THAN ME.
I LOVE THE STUFF.
Blinova: WELL,
IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.
WE'VE INDIVIDUALIZED
EACH SUNDAE IN THE MIDDLE.
Wolff:
IN THE MIDDLE IS THE SUNDAE,
GABE, I WAS CURIOUS --
YOU WERE TELLING US YOUR STORY,
GABE, I LOVE HOW
YOU STARTED THE BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR IT.
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP GOING.
IN FOOD,
I GOT TO LOVE THE PRODUCT.
I WISH YOU ALL THE SUCCESS
IN THE WORLD, UM...
BUT I'M OUT.
OKAY.
UM, 100 CALORIES
FOR A PINT...
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-I MEAN, WHAT PERSON
DOESN'T WANT TO EAT
A PINT OF ICE CREAM?
-EXACTLY.
-THE PROBLEM FOR ME IS --
IS I DIDN'T REALLY LOVE
THE TASTE OF IT.
I REALLY WANTED TO,
BUT I'M OUT.
SO, WE'RE ALL OUT
EXCEPT KEVIN.
WELL, I'M LISTENING
TO THE OTHER SHARKS,
WELL, GABE, YOU'RE NOT GOING
AFTER A WIDE MARKET.
SURE.
IT'S BETTER TO BE THE BEST WINK
IN A NARROW CATEGORY.
