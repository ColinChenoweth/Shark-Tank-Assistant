-I'M DEBRA.
-I AM HUGO.
Debra: AND OUR COMPANY
IS SAAVY NATURALS.
YOU READY TO COOK?
HUGO AND I MET
ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO.
Hugo: SHE FILLED MY HEART
WITH LOVE,
AND I KNEW
THAT SHE WAS MY SOUL MATE.
[ SIZZLING ]
DON'T THEY LOOK GOOD?
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
DELICIOUS.
OUR BACKGROUND
IS IN THE FOOD BUSINESS.
WE ARE
PROFESSIONAL CHEFS.
-CAN I TASTE IT?
-TASTE IT.
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT WE PUT
IN OUR BODIES IS IMPORTANT,
BUT IT'S WHAT WE PUT
ON OUR SKIN, AS WELL.
USING OUR CULINARY SKILLS,
WE SET OUT TO MAKE
THE MOST NATURAL
BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS EVER.
-WHAT A GENIUS.
-OH. [ CHUCKLES ]
THIS ISN'T
OUR FIRST COMPANY.
WE HAD A COMPANY THAT WE BUILT
TO $10 MILLION IN SALES.
WE SOLD TOO MUCH
OF OUR EQUITY.
WE LOST MAJORITY OWNERSHIP
OF THAT BUSINESS,
AND WE REALLY SEE SAAVY
AS OUR SECOND CHANCE AT SUCCESS.
WE NEED THE BUSINESS SAVVY
OF A SHARK
TO HELP US
SHARE OUR PASSION
OF FOOD AND BEAUTY CARE
WITH THE WORLD.
HELLO, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS DEBRA SAAVEDRA.
AND MY NAME
IS HUGO SAAVEDRA.
WE ARE THE FOUNDERS
OF SAAVY NATURALS.
WE ARE HERE TODAY
TO ASK FOR $200,000
FOR 10% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING, SHARKS --
ANOTHER LINE OF SOAPS
AND LOTION.
THIS LINE IS DIFFERENT
THAN ANYTHING
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN
OR TASTED BEFORE.
AND I SAY "TASTED."
IT'S SO INCREDIBLE
THAT YOU CAN EAT IT --
SO PURE THAT
YOU CAN FEED YOUR WIFE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-MMM, DELICIOUS.
-[ LAUGHS ]
SHARKS, DID YOU KNOW YOUR SKIN
IS YOUR BODY'S LARGEST ORGAN?
OUR PHILOSOPHY IS
THAT IF YOU CARE ABOUT
WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY,
YOU SHOULD ALSO CARE ABOUT
WHAT YOU PUT <i>ON</i> YOUR BODY.
THAT'S WHY
WE CREATED SAAVY NATURALS.
THE REASON WE PUT EMPHASIS
IN ABOUT THE FOOD, WE ARE CHEFS.
EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT HERE --
THE WHOLE ENTIRE LINE --
IS MADE WITH FOOD-GRADE
INGREDIENTS.
AND WE MAKE
EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT
IN OUR VERY OWN
KITCHEN FACTORY
TO ENSURE
THE HIGHEST INTEGRITY.
SO, SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO JOIN US
AND HELP US TO MAKE
THE WORLD --
THE WORLD
A MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE?
CAN WE SEE IT?
CAN WE TRY IT?
SURE.
THANK YOU.
WE HAVE SOME SAMPLES FOR YOU.
-IT SMELLS EXTREMELY FRAGRANT.
-YEAH.
CAN BARBARA TASTE IT FIRST?
-YES, SURE.
-[ CHUCKLES ] I'M WILLING.
IF YOU DON'T SURVIVE, BARBARA,
I'LL MAKE KEVIN TRY IT NEXT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S REALLY DELICIOUS.
Greiner: OH, I'M SURE.
WE'RE GETTING SOME?
IS IT, BARBARA?
-AND I'M GONNA --
-WHAT ARE YOU -- [ LAUGHS ]
-UH-OH.
-BARB, DID YOU LIKE IT?
IT'S NOT BAD. IT TASTES
LIKE PERFUME AND SUGAR.
-YOU KNOW WHAT?
-THANK YOU.
WOW, THIS SMELLS GREAT.
WHAT IS THIS?
THAT IS A TAHITIAN VANILLA
AND KUKUI.
-THE REASON IS --
-WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT?
IT'S A SCRUB --
EXFOLIATE.
IT WILL DETOXIFY YOUR SKIN,
REJUVENATE YOUR SKIN.
AND OUR PHILOSOPHY IS THAT
WHAT YOU PUT ON YOUR SKIN
SHOULD BE AS PURE AS THE FOOD
THAT YOU EAT AND THAT --
IT'S NOT THAT YOU EXPECT
ANYBODY TO EAT IT.
RIGHT, IT'S NOT --
...YOU JUST DON'T WANT
CHEMICALS IN IT.
EXACTLY. THANK YOU, LORI.
IT'S --
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES?
WE HAD AROUND,
IN THE PAST YEAR, $750,000.
GOOD FOR YOU.
-WOW, WAS IT ALL ONLINE?
-WOW, WHERE DO YOU SELL?
WE DON'T DO NO BUSINESS ONLINE.
LET ME TELL YOU WHY.
-ARE YOU GONNA CHANGE THAT?
-YES.
WE WOULD LOVE TO CHANGE THAT.
-WE WILL.
-IT'S LOW-HANGING FRUIT.
-OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENED IS,
WE HAVE EXPERIENCE
IN BUILDING
A BIG COMPANY.
WE GREW ALMOST
A $10 MILLION COMPANY --
A PREVIOUS COMPANY.
-OH, PREVIOUS.
WHAT -- WHAT DID
THAT COMPANY DO, HUGO?
THEY WERE DOING
SOAPS, LOTION.
OH, SO THIS --
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE?
-WE DID. EXACTLY.
-EXACTLY.
WAS IT YOUR COMPANY, OR DID
YOU WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE?
Debra: IT WAS -- IT WAS
OUR COMPANY TO BEGIN WITH,
BUT WE LOST CONTROLLING
INTEREST IN THE COMPANY.
DEBRA, YOU BUILT
A $10 MILLION COMPANY
THAT YOU STARTED
AND YOU LOST CONTROL.
HOW DID YOU LOSE CONTROL?
[ SIGHS ]
WE BROUGHT IN INVESTORS,
AND WE SOLD THAT MAJORITY
INTEREST IN OUR COMPANY.
MAJORITY?
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A REASON
FOR DOING THAT THEN.
AND WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW?
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT,
WE WERE NOT SAVVY THEN,
BUT WE ARE "SAAVY" NOW.
WAS IT BECAUSE
YOU NEEDED CASH TO OPERATE?
-CORRECT.
-CORRECT.
GOT IT. AND THAT'S WHY
YOU LOST CONTROL?
-CORRECT.
-DID YOU JUST START THIS?
WE STARTED THIS
APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AGO.
DEBRA --
AND TWO MONTHS LATER,
WE WENT TO WHOLE FOODS.
Herjavec:
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
WE HAVE INCREDIBLE RELATIONS
IN OUR INDUSTRY --
THE NATURAL PRODUCT
INDUSTRY.
WE ARE --
SO $750,000 IN SALES
IS GOING THROUGH RETAIL?
-CORRECT.
-WHOLESALE TO WHOLE FOODS.
SO ARE YOU
IN WHOLE FOODS NATIONWIDE?
LET ME --
-NOT YET.
-NO.
WE CAN --
-WHAT REGION ARE YOU IN?
WE ARE IN A STORE
IN CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, BOSTON.
SO LET'S TAKE A TYPICAL PRODUCT
LIKE A BAR OF SOAP
AND WALK US
THROUGH THE NUMBERS.
SO, OUR PRODUCTS RANGE IN PRICE
FROM APPROXIMATELY $6 TO $15.
AND WHAT'S YOUR MARGIN
FROM WHOLESALE?
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S BETWEEN 30% AND 40%...
WE --
OOH.
...BECAUSE WE ARE BUYING
IN SUCH LIMITED QUANTITIES.
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
FOR INVENTORY, BASICALLY?
EXACTLY.
CORRECT.
SO HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU PUT IN
TO START THE BUSINESS?
AROUND $350,000.
I JUST WANT TO BRING A LITTLE
REALITY TO OUR CONVERSATION,
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO DO IT AT THIS POINT.
THIS IS SOAP, OKAY?
THIS IS A COMMODITY,
AND IT'S VERY GOOD.
TELL ME WHERE I'M WRONG.
$200,000 FOR 10% COMPUTES
A VALUE OF $2 MILLION
FOR THIS BUSINESS.
CORRECT.
YOU MAKE $100,000 PRE-TAX,
OKAY?
YOU'RE GONNA PAY 25% TAX MINIMUM
ON THIS THING.
THAT MEANS 75%.
YOU WANT ME TO PAY
A 25 MULTIPLE ON SOAP?
YOU MUST BE KIDDING.
KEVIN, THAT'S SO RIDICULOUS.
THEY'RE JUST STARTING OUT.
IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS.
IT'S SOAP!
IT'S A FIRST-YEAR STARTUP.
-I -- I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT.
-I PREDICT WITH 100% CERTAINTY
YOU WILL NOT GET ONE SHARK
TO GIVE YOU $200,000 FOR 10%.
IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT,
THEY WOULDN'T BE A SHARK --
THEY'D BE BANKRUPT.
NO, BECAUSE THEY WILL BET
ON WHO WE ARE.
KUMBAYA. WHO CARES?
I'M SORRY, BUT --
IT'S CASH FLOW.
IT'S A COMMODITY.
CORRECT, BUT IN -- IN AUGUST,
WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH WITH ULTA.
-MR. WONDERFUL?
-YES.
BEFORE YOU -- YOU TELL ME
I AM A ROACH, I AM GONNA --
[ LAUGHTER ]
I'M GONNA --
I AM GONNA TELL YOU WHAT.
MR. WONDERFUL.
Herjavec: I LOVE YOU.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU'RE A COCKROACH
IN THE SOAP BUSINESS,
I SAID YOU'RE INSANE
ON YOUR VALUATION.
NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT BEFORE YOU DO THAT --
WE ARE NOT A ROACH,
BUT WE ARE LIKE
A BUTTERFLY AND A BEE.
MY WIFE IS
SO BEAUTIFUL, LUXURIOUS,
AND -- AND IS MY PARTNER
IN LIFE.
HOW MANY YEARS
HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED?
10 YEARS.
WE FIRST MET 27 YEARS AGO.
WE MARRIED OTHER PEOPLE.
OUR LIVES WENT
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
ONE DAY,
OUT OF THE COMPLETE BLUE,
I GET A PHONE CALL
FROM HIM.
17 YEARS LATER,
AND HE TOLD ME,
"I NEVER STOPPED
THINKING ABOUT YOU."
-OH, MY GOD, I LOVE THAT.
-WOW, DESTINY.
-KARMA.
-YOU GOT GAME, HUGO.
-YOU GOT GAME!
-OH, HONEY, LET ME TELL YA.
HE WON YOU OVER
BECAUSE HE WAS SO IN LOVE.
I LOVE THE STORY.
BUT THANK GOODNESS I'M HERE
TO BRING US BACK TO REALITY.
HUGO, YOU CAN'T GET
25 TIMES FOR SOAP.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
-YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE
WITH OUR SOAP.
GOT IT.
I THINK THE PRODUCT'S GREAT.
BUT, DEBRA...
MY COUSIN TOLD ME
HE NEVER PAID ATTENTION
...IT'S SOAP.
TO A SOAP,
AND OURS IS SOAP CRACK.
IT'S SOAP!
IT'S SOAP!
IT THINK YOU'RE ONLY WORTH
ABOUT $400,000.
YOU HAVE DEBT
ON THE COMPANY NOW?
WE TOOK ON SOME DEBT
FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
AROUND $400,000.
-UH-OH.
-YOU GOT GOOD FRIENDS.
OOH.
OKAY, YOUR COMPANY HAS CURRENTLY
NO VALUE AT ALL.
YOU -- YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE $400,000
OFF THE $400,000 VALUE
I GAVE YOU.
WELL,
WE'RE HERE TO NEGOTIATE.
I'M OUT.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
Cuban: GUYS, LOOK --
ONE OF MY COMPANIES
IS SIMPLE SUGARS,
AND SIMPLE SUGARS IS THE --
IS ALSO ONLY ORGANIC MATERIALS,
ONLY EDIBLE MATERIALS.
-I AM FAMILIAR WITH THAT.
-RIGHT.
Hugo: CORRECT.
BECAUSE IT'S COMPETITIVE
WITH SIMPLE SUGARS,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
I'M OUT.
-BUT WE --
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-THANK YOU.
-BUT --
I LOVE YOUR STORY.
I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT COUPLE.
I'M A ROMANTIC,
BUT MY THOUGHT --
IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE SPACE.
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU GUYS HAVE EACH OTHER,
SO YOUR LIFE IS GOLDEN.
THEY STILL HAVE
TO PAY THEIR RENT, BABY.
-THANK YOU.
-I'M OUT.
BARBARA --
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
JUST BEFORE
YOU START PITCHING HER,
I'M GONNA TELL YOU YOU HAVE
A LARGE CHANCE OF SUCCESS.
SHE'S REALLY BAD WITH NUMBERS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
Corcoran: BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M REALLY GREAT WITH.
I'M GREAT WITH PEOPLE.
AND YOU'RE JUST THE KIND
OF PEOPLE THAT I LOVE.
YOU'RE GENUINE.
YOUR HEART AND SOUL
IS TOTALLY INTO IT.
IF I SAID TO YOU, "I WANT YOU TO
CHANGE THE NAME OF THE BUSINESS.
HERE'S MY NAME.
IT'LL SELL BETTER."
HOW OPEN WOULD YOU BE?
-WE'D DO IT IN A HEARTBEAT.
SO YOU WOULD ACTUALLY LISTEN
TO SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE,
KNOWING NOTHING
ABOUT YOUR INDUSTRY?
YOU WOULD BE TOTALLY OPEN
TO THAT?
THE THING THAT WE
DON'T WANT TO COMPROMISE ON
IS THE QUALITY
OF OUR PRODUCTS.
I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH KEVIN
ON THE VALUATION.
WHAT IF I SAID TO YOU,
"I'LL TAKE 50%
OF YOUR BUSINESS FOR $200,000"?
IN HUGO AND DEBRA'S
NATURAL BODY CARE LINE, SAAVY,
BUT SHE WANTS 50%
OF THE COMPANY.
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING --
YOU HAVE $400,000 OF DEBT.
THERE'S PRACTICALLY NOTHING
OF VALUE RIGHT NOW.
SHE'S GONNA STEP
IN FRONT OF THAT DEBT.
SHE'S GONNA HELP YOU
RUN THIS COMPANY.
Corcoran: I COULD HELP YOU
RUN THIS COMPANY,
BECAUSE I'M THE OPPOSITE
OF YOU, ALL RIGHT?
AND THOSE ARE
GREAT PARTNERSHIPS.
HUGO, DEBRA, OUT OF NOWHERE,
OUT OF THIN AIR,
JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT
THE END WAS HERE,
YOU COME UP WITH TWO OFFERS.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
WE'D LOVE
TO TAKE YOUR OFFER, BARBARA.
-YES! SMART WOMAN.
-THANK YOU.
-AH, ROMANCE IN THE AIR.
-PLEASURE.
WHOO-HOO!
-WE'RE GONNA DO GREAT.
-ALL RIGHT, I HAVE NO DOUBT.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-NO DOUBT.
-THANK YOU, BARBARA.
-MY PLEASURE. TAKE CARE.
-SURE. GOD BLESS.
-VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOODBYE.
-BYE-BYE. THANK YOU, GUYS.
-GOOD LUCK.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-GOOD LUCK.
-CONGRATS.
-THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE SO CUTE.
GETTING A DEAL TODAY
WAS CRITICAL FOR US,
AND WHEN I THOUGHT
ALL THE SHARKS WERE OUT,
I WAS SENDING TELEPATHIC
MESSAGES TO BARBARA,
SAYING, "BARBARA, I REALLY WANT
TO DO A DEAL WITH YOU,"
AND I THINK SHE HEARD ME.
[ LAUGHS ]
