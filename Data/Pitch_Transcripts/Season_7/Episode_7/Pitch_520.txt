HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS GABE WOLFF.
I'M ANI BLINOVA, AND WE'RE
FROM STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT.
OUR COMPANY
IS WINK FROZEN DESSERTS,
AND WE'RE SEEKING $300,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
ICE CREAM -- IT'S A M--
IT'S -- I --
-YES, IT IS.
-IT IS.
EASY TO SAY.
ICE CREAM -- IT'S AMERICA'S
FAVORITE DESSERT,
BUT LET'S FACE IT --
IT'S SO BAD FOR YOU.
BUT GOING COLD TURKEY
ON THIS FROZEN TREAT
IS A LOT MORE DIFFICULT
THAN IT SOUNDS.
AS AN ICE CREAM ADDICT MYSELF
WHO'S VERY HEALTH-CONSCIOUS,
I DECIDED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
SO I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN
AND PLAYED MAD SCIENTIST
TO CREATE MY OWN HEALTHY,
ALL-NATURAL FROZEN TREAT.
WINK FROZEN DESSERTS
IS A DAIRY-FREE
AND SUGAR-FREE FROZEN TREAT
THAT'S NOT ONLY VEGAN --
IT'S FREE OF ALL
THE TOP 8 ALLERGENS
AND, MY PERSONAL
FAVORITE PART,
WEIGHS IN
AT ONLY 100 CALORIES...
Together:
FOR THE ENTIRE PINT!
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WE DO ALL THIS BY USING...
WHAT?!
...NATURAL, NON-GENETICALLY
MODIFIED INGREDIENTS
WHILE STILL DELIVERING
ON SWEETNESS AND FLAVOR.
SHARKS, WITH WINK, YOU WON'T
EVEN MISS REGULAR ICE CREAM.
WE'VE CREATED
A DELICIOUS TREAT
THAT SATISFIES
ALMOST ANY SWEET TOOTH,
BUT NEED YOUR HELP
IN ORDER
TO BRING WINK
TO THE NATIONAL STAGE.
SO, SHARKS, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO TRY THE HEALTHIEST...
AND TASTIEST.
...THING TO EVER HAPPEN
TO ICE CREAM.
Together: WINK!
-CAN WE TRY IT?
-OF COURSE.
-ABSOLUTELY.
-GABE, I HAVE BAD NEWS FOR YOU.
-YEAH?
-I AM AN ICE CREAM EXPERT.
-UH-OH.
-UH-OH.
NOBODY EATS MORE
ICE CREAM THAN ME.
I LOVE THE STUFF.
Blinova: WELL,
IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.
WE'VE INDIVIDUALIZED
EACH SUNDAE IN THE MIDDLE.
OH, THANK YOU.
IT'S VANILLA WITH MAPLE PECAN
GRANOLA AND SOME CHERRIES.
WOW, WE'RE IN
FOR SOME GOOD STUFF.
LORI, THIS IS FOR YOU.
IT IS OUR CAKE BATTER,
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FLAVOR...
-THANK YOU.
-...WITH STRAWBERRIES
AND DAIRY-FREE AND ALLERGEN-FREE
CHOCOLATE CHIPS.
Wolff:
IN THE MIDDLE IS THE SUNDAE,
AND RIGHT ON THE PERIMETER
OF YOUR SUNDAE,
YOU HAVE A SAMPLE
OF EACH FLAVOR.
SO WE HAVE SIX FLAVORS.
OUR FIRST FLAVOR
IS CAKE BATTER.
IT'S A GLUTEN-FREE
CAKE BATTER,
SO THERE IS NO OTHER GLUTEN-FREE
CAKE BATTER ON THE MARKET YET.
THEN WE HAVE COCOA DOUGH,
WHICH IS LIKE
A CHOCOLATY COOKIE DOUGH.
THEN WE DO CINNAMON BUN,
ICED LATTE,
AND CHOCO-MINT,
AND THEN VANILLA BEAN.
WHAT IS
THE SUBSTITUTE SUGAR?
WE USE ORGANIC STEVIA
AND MONK FRUIT TO SWEETEN IT.
IT TASTES KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
IN THE MIDDLE.
MM-HMM.
THAT'S WHY WE DO THE SUNDAES,
TO ADD A LITTLE BIT
OF FLAVOR TO IT AND SO
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT.
I-I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT...
NO, THAT'S FINE.
YOU CAN SAY IT.
...BUT IT TASTES KIND OF BLAND
ON ITS OWN.
YEAH, IT'S NOT A PRODUCT
THAT'S MEANT TO HIT A HOME RUN
WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON
WHO TRIES IT.
YEAH.
IS IT A PRODUCT THAT'S MEANT
TO BE EATEN ON ITS OWN,
OR DO YOU SEE IT
AS A MIXER WITH SOMETHING?
YEP.
WELL, WE HAVE CUSTOMERS
THAT DO BOTH.
I, PERSONALLY, LOVE TO EAT THE
CAKE BATTER ON -- ON ITS OWN.
O'Leary: BUT, ANI, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE 100 CALORIES.
YOU COULD BE 200 CALORIES
AND STILL BE 50% LESS
THAN MOST ICE CREAMS MADE
WITH MILK FAT.
IS THAT TRUE? IS THE AVERAGE TUB
OF THAT SIZE 500 CALORIES?
600 CALORIES.
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-SO, WOW!
SO DID YOU TEST GOING
TO 200 CALORIES TO SEE
IF IT -- IT MADE THE BASE
PRODUCT MORE INTERESTING?
SURE.
YEAH, AND WHAT IT DOES --
YOU GET MORE OF THE FLAVOR,
BUT YOU DO END UP
ADDING A COUPLE GRAMS OF FAT
OR LIKE 1 GRAM OF SUGAR.
WELL, WHAT DO SALES SAY?
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I PERSONALLY THINK.
YEAH, HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SOLD?
-IT MATTERS WHAT SALES ARE.
-SO -- ABSOLUTELY.
SO, TO DATE,
WE'VE SOLD $534,000 WORTH.
-OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
-THREE YEARS, UM...
OHH.
AND HOW
DO YOU SELL IT?
WE STARTED WITH AN ONLINE STORE,
GOING DIRECT TO CONSUMER.
Blinova:
WE'RE IN SEVERAL RETAILERS
AROUND OUR AREA
IN THE NORTHEAST.
SO WE'RE IN WHOLE FOODS.
YOGURTS --
HOW MANY WHOLE FOODS
ARE YOU IN?
-30.
-30.
WHAT IS THE SUBSTANCE
THAT THIS IS MADE OUT OF?
SO, THE BASE IS PEA PROTEIN,
SO IT'S A VEGETABLE
PROTEIN-BASED NON-GMO.
PEA PROTEIN.
GABE, I WAS CURIOUS --
YOU WERE TELLING US YOUR STORY,
AND YOU SAID YOU
JUST WENT IN THE KITCHEN...
-YEAH.
-...AND MADE THE ICE CREAM.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
SO, GROWING UP,
I WAS THE CHUBBY KID IN SCHOOL.
YOU WERE?
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
I GOT PICKED ON A LOT.
-THANK YOU.
-[ LAUGHS ]
-BARBARA, LEAVE HIM ALONE.
-YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT.
SO, MY WHOLE
ENTIRE FAMILY STRUGGLED
WITH DIABETES, WITH OBESITY.
AND THEN WHEN I TURNED 17,
I WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH CELIAC DISEASE
AND A DAIRY INTOLERANCE,
SO IT DRASTICALLY CHANGED
THE WAY I HAD TO EAT.
AND THIS IS A FULL-TIME JOB
FOR BOTH OF YOU?
-YES.
-NOW IT IS, YES.
-YEAH.
HOW MUCH DID YOU
MAKE LAST YEAR?
THE COMPANY
LOST MONEY LAST YEAR...
YEAH.
...BUT GROSS PROFIT
WAS ABOUT $87,000.
AND WHERE'S
THE BREAK-EVEN POINT?
WE'RE ACTUALLY PROJECTED
TO MAKE $650,000 THIS YEAR.
YEP.
WHY A SUDDEN CHANGE? IT SOUNDS
LIKE IT'S A BIG LEAP HERE.
WE HAVE ABOUT 180 STORES
THAT ARE COMING ON.
THE REASON THERE WAS
SUCH A LOSS LAST YEAR
WAS BECAUSE WE HAD PROBLEMS
WITH THE CO-PACKER.
WE HAD THEIR FREEZER
BREAKING DOWN.
WE LOST ABOUT $60,000
WORTH OF PRODUCT.
OUCH.
-OKAY, THAT'S WHY.
-RIGHT AT ICE CREAM SEASON.
LIKE, THE NUMBERS
JUST DIDN'T ADD UP --
I HAVE A QUESTION.
GUYS, I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT,
AND PERHAPS
I LACK APPRECIATION,
BUT I DIDN'T FIND
IT HAD ANY TASTE
UNTIL I BIT
INTO YOUR TRIMMINGS THERE.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
THAN THE TASTE, FOR ME,
I LOVE TO BUY A BUSINESS
THAT'S ON THE WINNING SIDE.
EVERYBODY LOVES A WINNER,
ESPECIALLY INVESTORS.
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR
BETTER FOR YOU TO COME IN HERE
AFTER YOU'D TURNED THE CORNER
OF A PROFIT OF SOME KIND.
-SURE.
-SURE.
SO BECAUSE OF THE TIMING
OF YOUR PITCH, I'M OUT.
-OKAY, THANK VERY MUCH.
-THANK YOU.
I WOULD -- I WOULD LIKE
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE
CONCERNS THAT YOU VOICED.
FINE -- FOR THE OTHER SHARKS,
CERTAINLY.
SO, WE'RE GONNA MAKE
$650,000 THIS YEAR,
EASILY MAKING $450,000
IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR.
AT THAT,
WE'LL MAKE A $50,000 PROFIT.
NEXT YEAR,
WE'VE ALREADY HAD MEETINGS
WITH SOME
OF THE BIGGER RETAILERS.
THEY LOVE THE PRODUCT.
THEY LOVE WHO WE ARE.
THEY LOVE WHAT WE'RE DOING.
GUYS, I WANTED SO BAD
TO LOVE THIS.
MM.
I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT.
IF MY WIFE EVEN SEES ICE CREAM,
SHE YANKS IT AWAY
BECAUSE SHE HAS TO PAY THE
PENALTY OF ME EATING ICE CREAM.
RIGHT.
I'M SURE
IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE.
-MM-HMM.
-IT JUST WASN'T MY TASTE.
AND SO, FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
GABE, I LOVE HOW
YOU STARTED THE BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE A PASSION FOR IT.
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP GOING.
IN FOOD,
I GOT TO LOVE THE PRODUCT.
I WISH YOU ALL THE SUCCESS
IN THE WORLD, UM...
BUT I'M OUT.
OKAY.
UM, 100 CALORIES
FOR A PINT...
-YEAH.
-YEAH.
-I MEAN, WHAT PERSON
DOESN'T WANT TO EAT
A PINT OF ICE CREAM?
-EXACTLY.
-THE PROBLEM FOR ME IS --
IS I DIDN'T REALLY LOVE
THE TASTE OF IT.
I REALLY WANTED TO,
BUT I'M OUT.
SO, WE'RE ALL OUT
EXCEPT KEVIN.
WELL, I'M LISTENING
TO THE OTHER SHARKS,
AND -- AND, BASICALLY,
WHAT THEY'VE SAID,
AND INTERPRETING IT DOWN
TO WHAT THEY MEAN IS THIS --
YOU'VE ACHIEVED VEGAN,
GLUTEN FREE, SUGAR FREE,
DAIRY FREE, SOY FREE, FAT FREE,
NUT FREE, EGG FREE,
AND TASTE FREE.
THE ONLY CUSTOMERS
YOU HAVE ARE ONES
THAT HAVE TO HAVE THIS
FOR HEALTH REASONS.
I GET IT,
BUT I THINK YOU CAN DO BETTER.
I THINK THIS PRODUCT
COULD HAVE MET AT LEAST HALFWAY
THE EXPECTATIONS
OF A CUBAN, OR LORI,
WHO'S SO POLITE
IN THE WAY SHE SAYS
IT TASTES LIKE CRAP,
BUT IT DOES TASTE LIKE CRAP --
THAT'S THE TRUTH.
AND MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY
IT HAS TO TASTE,
BUT AS AN INVESTMENT,
NOT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
-OKAY.
-HE'S SO RUDE.
-I'M NOT RUDE.
-OH, YES, YOU'RE RUDE.
Cuban:
HEY, GUYS, BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING, RIGHT,
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY, IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU EXPECT TO COME IN HERE.
RIGHT.
DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT
TASTES, SO I DON'T WANT TO --
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO THROW YOU UNDER THE BUS.
WELL, GABE, YOU'RE NOT GOING
AFTER A WIDE MARKET.
SURE.
IT'S BETTER TO BE THE BEST WINK
IN A NARROW CATEGORY.
I-I UNDERSTAND, LIKE,
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU GUYS EXPECTED.
YEAH, IT'S NOT
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,
BUT, I MEAN, OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE OBSESSED WITH US.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
-DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU.
-THANK YOU.
