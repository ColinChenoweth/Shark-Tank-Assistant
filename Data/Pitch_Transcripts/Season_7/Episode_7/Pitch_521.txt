THE CO-FOUNDERS OF CLEAN CUBE.

ARTHUR, HOW MANY USERS?
WE HAVE 528 --
552 USERS.
ARTHUR, I LOVE THIS SPACE.
I THINK THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM.
I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING
TO INSTANT DELIVERY.
BUT WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT
IS THE FOOTPRINT.
IN A WORLD THAT'S MOVING

YOU NEED PHYSICAL SPACE.
YOU'VE GOT TO CONVINCE PEOPLE
TO USE IT,
