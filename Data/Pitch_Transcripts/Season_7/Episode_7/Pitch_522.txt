AND THIS IS MY AMAZING MOTHER.

AND WE'RE THE CO-OWNERS
Clark: JUST PUT
YOUR FEET ON ONE SIDE...

[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
-OH, YOU LITTLE SHOWOFF.
-WATCH OUT.
LINDA, I'M GETTING DIZZY!
STOP THAT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, TELL US,
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS?
WELL, WHEN I TURNED 60
A FEW YEARS AGO, I --
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I COULDN'T LOSE
ANY WEIGHT AROUND MY MIDDLE.
I CALLED GLORIA.
WE DID SOME RESEARCH.
O'Leary:
BUT, GLORIA, HOW DOES IT WORK
ON A TYPICAL CARPET
IN SOMEONE'S DEN?
YOU KNOW, IT WORKS
ON ALMOST EVERY --
IT WORKS ON ALL CARPETS.
IT'S A LITTLE MORE --
WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S
ON THE WOOD SURFACE?
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO SCRATCH YOUR WOOD FLOORS,
SO WE DO RECOMMEND
PUTTING SOMETHING DOWN, BUT --
-DO YOU SELL THE MATS, TOO?
-WE DON'T.
WE ACTUALLY
JUST HAVE A PROTOTYPE
MADE OF A PLATFORM
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET MADE,
LINDA,
THERE'S NO PATENT ON THAT?
-NO.
-NO.
ONCE I PUT IT
ON THE SPECIAL PLATFORM --
YES.
-SO IT'S THE ATTACHMENT?
-YES, YES.
O'Leary: SO SOMEONE COULD
KNOCK IT OFF SLIGHTLY
GLORIA, ON THE $500,000 YOU
SOLD, WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON THAT?
$260,000.
ARE THERE OTHER
BALANCE BOARDS ON THE MARKET,
GLORIA, LET ME TELL YOU WHERE
I'M AT -- FANTASTIC PRODUCT.
MY CONCERN IS THERE'S
NOTHING PROPRIETARY HERE.
UM, GREAT IDEA, THOUGH.
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
I'M OUT.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
JUST -- ARE THERE
ANY OTHER OFFERS?
THIS IS DEFINITELY A PRODUCT
THAT NEEDS AN INFOMERCIAL,
FOR GLORIA AND LINDA'S
EXERCISE BOARD, SIMPLY FIT.
ALL RIGHT, GLORIA, YOU'VE GOT
$125,000 FOR 20% FROM LORI,
$250,000 FOR 30%
FROM KEVIN.
DOWN TO TWO OFFERS.
-YOU GUYS HAVE TO GO FAST.
I'M JUST WONDERING,
BASED ON OUR BACKGROUNDS...
WELL, I'M CURIOUS
IF THEY WOULD --
...WHAT YOU HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT.
DO YOU WANT TO --
WOULD YOU GUYS WANT
TO DO A DEAL TOGETHER?
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW MUCH EQUITY --
NO.
I WILL GO SOLO HERE,
BECAUSE THIS IS MY WORLD.
YES.
THIS IS --
THIS IS MY SWEET SPOT.
THIS IS WHAT
I'M EXCELLENT AT.
I MAKE MILLIONAIRES THIS WAY.
Hoffman: YAY!
YOU'VE JUST CHOSEN
THE BEAUTY OVER THE BEAST.
YOU HAVE GREAT TASTE.
OH, I WOULDN'T CALL HIM
A BEAST.
