HI. MY NAME IS ARTHUR.
AND I'M RYAN. AND WE'RE
THE CO-FOUNDERS OF CLEAN CUBE.
WE'RE ASKING FOR $300,000
FOR 10% OF OUR COMPANY.
SHARKS, WE LIVE
IN A WORLD OF CONVENIENCE.
TODAY, PEOPLE ARE ORDERING
THEIR TOILET PAPER
AND TOOTHPASTE ONLINE.
YOU CAN EVEN GET
YOUR CLOTHES LAUNDERED
WITH A SIMPLE PHONE APP.
BUT PEOPLE
ARE STILL STRUGGLING
WITH THE FINAL LEG
OF THESE TRANSACTIONS --
THE ACTUAL HAND-OFF
BETWEEN THE DELIVERY PERSON
AND THE CUSTOMER.
WHEN YOU ORDER SOMETHING ONLINE,
YOU HAVE TO SIT THERE
AND SUFFER THROUGH
A TWO-HOUR DELIVERY WINDOW,
OR A PACKAGE CAN GET LEFT
VULNERABLE ON YOUR DOORSTEP.
EVEN WORSE,
YOU MISS IT ALL TOGETHER,
AND IT GETS TAKEN BACK
TO THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER.
IN THE INDUSTRY, WE CALL THIS
THE PROBLEM OF THE LAST MILE.
CLEAN CUBE
HAS A SOLUTION.
CLEAN CUBE IS
LIKE A DIGITAL DOORMAN.
WE ARE THE MISSING LINK
BETWEEN CONSUMERS
AND THE ON-DEMAND
SERVICE PROVIDERS.
NOW, WE BROUGHT
A REPLICA OF ONE
OF OUR CURRENT INSTALLATIONS
IN NEW YORK CITY,
AND WE WOULD LOVE THE CHANCE
TO DEMO THE TECHNOLOGY FOR YOU.
BARBARA,
WOULD YOU MIND COMING UP?
WHY NOT?
-HI, BARBARA.
-HI.
THANKS
FOR HELPING US OUT.
SO, BARBARA,
YOU'RE A NEW YORKER.
YES,
WITH A DOORMAN.
WITH A DOORMAN.
ONCE YOU REGISTER,
YOU GET A PASSCODE.
SO YOUR PASSCODE
FOR THE DEMO IS 12345.
MM-HMM.
SO WHY DON'T YOU DROP OFF
THE DRY CLEANING?
-OKAY.
-SO PRESS THE START BUTTON.
-YEAH.
-PUT IN YOUR PASSCODE.
12345.
AND THEN DROP OFF
YOUR DRY CLEANING.
IT'S SHOWING YOU
WHICH CUBES ARE AVAILABLE.
SO, RIGHT NOW, ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS PRESS THE WHITE CUBE,
AND IT'LL POP OPEN.
[ CLICK ]
SO OPEN THE CUBE.
AND STICK IT IN.
AND HIT "DONE."
NOT BAD.
WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU ALSO HAVE A PICK UP.
[ GASPS ]
YES.
SO, JUST PRESS
THE PICK UP BUTTON.
YEP.
AND IT SHOWS YOU
WHAT YOU HAVE TO PICK UP.
SO PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON.
-MM-HMM.
AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR PICK UP
IS IN THIS CUBE.
[ CLICK ]
POP IT OPEN.
A SURPRISE PACKAGE.
I LIKE IT.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
OOH.
LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE PACKAGE
YOU ORDERED FOR MARK.
[ THUD ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
-THERE YOU GO, FOR MARK.
-YOU DELIVER IT.
I'M NOT CARRYING HIS STUFF.
-OH, SURE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE YOU GO, MARK.
THANK YOU.
WHAT IS IT, BY THE WAY?
Shmulevsky:
SO WE KNOW YOU'RE --
YOU HAVE THE THREE COMMAS
FOR BILLIONAIRE.
WE THOUGHT
WE WOULD UP IT ONE --
THE TRILLIONAIRE HAT.
-THERE YOU GO.
-WHOA.
-NOW, SHARKS.
WE HAVE A SOLID FOOTPRINT
IN NEW YORK CITY,
AND NOW WE NEED YOUR EXPERTISE
TO GROW AND SCALE OUR PLATFORM.
WHERE ARE YOU
INSTALLING THESE?
WHY ARE THEY GIVING YOU
THE REAL ESTATE FOR THEM?
WHAT ARE THE ECONOMICS
FOR THEM AND FOR YOU?
SURE. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY IN
40 LOCATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY.
40?
YEAH, UH, IN THE
RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS.
UH, OUR BIGGEST BUILDING
IS 168 UNITS,
AND OUR SMALLEST IS 10.
-SO, HOW MANY CUBES --
SO THESE ARE
NON-DOORMAN BUILDINGS
THAT WANT
DOORMAN-TYPE SERVICES?
-EXACTLY.
-AND HOW MANY CUBES IS IT?
SO WE'RE AMENITIZING
THE BUILDINGS.
SO, THAT'S
A GREAT QUESTION.
THE BEST PART ABOUT THESE
IS THEY'RE COMPLETELY MODULAR
AND LEGO-LIKE.
PER 100 TENANTS,
HOW MANY CUBES DO YOU NEED?
BECAUSE NOTHING
WOULD MAKE ME CRAZIER
THAN BRINGING DOWN MY LAUNDRY
FROM THE 58th FLOOR...
-AND NOT HAVING A CUBE.
-...AND NOT HAVING A CUBE OPEN.
SURE.
I WOULD PERSONALLY FIND YOU
IF THAT HAPPENED.
SO, UH, RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE AVERAGING
ABOUT, UH, SEVEN APARTMENTS
FOR ONE CUBE.
AND WHAT IS THE CAPITAL COST
FOR ALL OF IT TOGETHER?
SO, A TYPICAL INSTALLATION
IS ABOUT $3,000.
THE FIGHT SEEMS TO BE,
YOU GO INTO A LARGE BUILDING,
SOMEBODY
IS MANAGING THE BUILDING
AND SAYS, "OKAY,
YOU WANT TO PUT THAT IN?
IT'S GONNA COST YOU
$400 A WEEK,
OR $1,000 A MONTH,"
OR WHATEVER IT IS.
IS THAT HOW IT WORKS?
SO, THE LAST THREE
INSTALLATIONS WE'VE DONE,
THE LANDLORD HAS PAID ABOUT
$7,000 PER INSTALLATION...
BUT -- BUT --
-WOW.
-THEY PAID YOU $7,000?
-WELL -- YES.
WELL, THE REASON
FOR IT IS BECAUSE --
WHY? WHAT'S THE BENEFIT
TO THE LANDLORD?
IT'S A HUGE SERVICE
TO HIS PEOPLE.
I MEAN, THERE'S NO --
THE RENT IN NEW YORK
IS ASTRONOMICAL,
AND THERE'S DEAD SPACE,
SO THE ABILITY
TO AMENITIZE
THESE LOBBIES --
AND THEN THEY RAISE THE RENT,
AND THAT'S IT.
YES.
OH, SO YOU THINK IT HELPS
THE BUILDING BE MORE ATTRACTIVE?
FOR SURE.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
Greiner: FOR SURE.
BARBARA,
DO YOU FIND THAT'S TRUE?
IF A BUILDING
HAD THIS IN IT...
Corcoran: WELL, THE -- THE --
WOULD YOU PAY $7,000
AS A LANDLORD?
THE REASON A BUILDING
WITHOUT A DOORMAN
CAN'T COMMAND IN THE RENT
THAT THEY SHOULD --
SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE,
SAME VIEW, SAME AMENITIES --
BUT THEY CAN'T CHARGE
WHAT THEY WANT
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
A DOORMAN.
SO THIS, IN A WAY,
REPLACES THE DOORMAN.
NOT TOTALLY,
BUT I GET IT.
AND OUR VISION
IS NOT JUST THAT THIS IS
A REAL-ESTATE PLAY
FOR RESIDENTIAL MARKETS.
WE WANT TO PEPPER THE
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH CLEAN CUBES.
WE WANT TO PUT THEM
IN ANY LOCATION
THAT OPENS EARLY
AND CLOSES LATE.
STARBUCKS, GYMS,
EVEN CHASE BANK ATMs.
SO IF I HAD A BROWNSTONE,
I'D WALK TO A LOCATION.
LAUNDROMATS. LAUNDROMATS.
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WANT TO PUT THEM ANYWHERE.
Shmulevsky: EXACTLY.
BUT WHO WOULD PAY FOR THAT,
AND WHY?
IT'LL BE BETWEEN
THE SUBWAY STOP
AND YOUR --
AND YOUR APARTMENT.
AND HOW WOULD YOU MONETIZE THAT?
WHO WOULD PAY FOR IT THEN?
WE'RE -- WE WANT TO CHARGE A $10
ACCESS FEE TO THE SUBSCRIBER.
TELL ME
WHAT YOUR SALES ARE.
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE NOT CHARGING
A SUBSCRIPTION FEE,
SO WE'RE ONLY MAKING MONEY
FROM THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE
AND FROM THE MARGINS.
SO THE LAST -- THE TRAILING
12 MONTH SALES HAS BEEN $130K,
WHICH $65,000, OR 50%, HAS COME
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS.
ARTHUR, HOW MANY USERS?
WE HAVE 528 --
552 USERS.
ARTHUR, I LOVE THIS SPACE.
I THINK THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM.
I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING
TO INSTANT DELIVERY.
BUT WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT
IS THE FOOTPRINT.
IN A WORLD THAT'S MOVING
TO FASTER SERVICES,
YOU NEED PHYSICAL SPACE.
YOU'VE GOT TO CONVINCE PEOPLE
TO USE IT,
AND YOU'VE GOT
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE
TO PUT IN A LARGE FOOTPRINT
INTO CONVENIENT NEIGHBORHOODS.
SURE.
I -- I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE
AN UPHILL BATTLE.
I DON'T SEE THIS WORKING.
I'M OUT.
OKAY, SO I LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY -- ANY DEAL I DO,
I TRY AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS THE POINT OF RESISTANCE
THAT STOPS IT FROM SCALING.
AND IN THIS CASE,
EVERY SINGLE INSTALLATION
IS A LONG,
PROTRACTED NEGOTIATION
WITH EITHER
THE INDEPENDENT STORE OWNER
IN A CONVENIENCE STORE,
THE LANDLORD,
THE OPERATOR.
A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF
HAS TO HAPPEN
BEFORE YOU
ACTUALLY INSTALL THESE.
BUT IT'S A HUGE PAIN
IN THE...REAR END --
LARGE PAIN THERE.
AND I HATE REAR-END PAIN.
I'M OUT.
I KNOW THERE IS
A HUGE PROBLEM THERE.
YOU HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA,
BUT YOU'RE STILL
FIGURING IT OUT --
JUST EVEN HOW TO MONETIZE IT.
YOU'RE JUST
AT THE VERY BEGINNING.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD
WRAP MY ARMS AROUND THIS
AS A BUSINESS.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU.
I THINK YOU'RE IN THE RACE
BETWEEN THE QUALITY
OF THE SOFTWARE INTERFACE,
THE SERVICES YOU CAN OFFER,
THE -- THE PURE,
ON-DEMAND ECONOMY,
AND PEOPLE WHO WILL SEE
THIS MARKET
AND TRY TO CAPTURE
ALL OF THAT MARGIN THEMSELVES.
I JUST DON'T SEE
THE "WOW FACTOR" THAT --
THAT'S GONNA GIVE IT
A HOCKEY STICK,
AND, SO, FOR THOSE REASONS,
I'M OUT.
-ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.
OKAY, THAT LEAVES ME.
I THINK YOU HAVE
A TERRIFIC BUSINESS
FOR ONE APPLICATION ONLY.
I DON'T BELIEVE
THE SUBSCRIPTION METHOD
IS REALLY GONNA WORK
AT YOUR LOCAL 7-Eleven.
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT.
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM
IN NEW YORK
FOR PEOPLE
WHO DON'T HAVE DOORMEN.
BUT HERE'S HOW THE REAL ESTATE
BREAKS DOWN.
YOU HAVE THOSE BUILDINGS THAT
HAVE IN EXCESS OF 100 UNITS --
THEY ALL HAVE DOORMEN,
ALL RIGHT?
99% OF THEM.
THEN YOU HAVE THE BUILDINGS
THAT HAVE FEWER
THAN EIGHT UNITS,
AND THEY DON'T HAVE
THE SPACE FOR THIS.
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SWEET SPOT
THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU --
THE UNITS
THAT HAVE 60, 80, 100 UNITS,
AND THEY DON'T HAVE DOORMEN --
THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT.
AND THEY COULD GET MORE
FOR THEIR RENT
IF THEY HAVE THIS
IN THERE, OKAY?
FOR SURE.
BUT THAT'S
ONLY ONE LITTLE THING.
YOU'RE TRYING TO STICK
THAT THREAD
THROUGH THAT LITTLE NEEDLE EYE,
AND THAT'S IT.
I THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR IT,
BUT I DON'T SEE IT
AS A BIG PLAY.
I JUST DON'T SEE YOU MAKING
A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS THING.
IT DOESN'T GET ME EXCITED,
I'M SORRY TO SAY, SO I'M OUT.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
-OKAY.
-THANK YOU, SHARKS.
-THANK YOU, GUYS.
-PLEASURE.
GOOD LUCK WITH THIS.
GOOD IDEA.
-NICE MEETING YOU.
-UH-HUH.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT
TO HAVE PARTNERSHIPS
WITH, YOU KNOW,
MARK OR BARBARA,
AND, YOU KNOW,
GROW THIS BUSINESS
THE WAY WE SEE IT
AND HOW WE WANT IT.
AND IT WOULD HAVE SHOT US
OUT OF THE BARREL,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE -- WE'RE, UH --
WE'LL DO IT ON OUR OWN.
