HI. MY NAME IS GLORIA HOFFMAN,
AND THIS IS MY AMAZING MOTHER.
HI. I'M LINDA CLARK,
AND WE'RE THE CO-OWNERS
AND CO-DEVELOPERS
OF THE SIMPLY FIT BOARD.
WE'RE HERE ASKING
FOR $125,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 15%
OF OUR BUSINESS.
NOW, WHETHER WE WANT
TO ADMIT IT OR NOT,
WE ALL HAVE PROBLEM AREAS,
FROM THE BELLY FAT
TO THE SADDLEBAGS,
THOSE DREADED MUFFIN TOPS.
YOU KNOW, THE SIX-PACKS
THAT WE ONCE HAD
HAVE NOW SADLY TURNED
INTO KEGS,
BUT WE'RE BATTLING THE BULGE
WITH ONE SIMPLE PRODUCT.
Together: INTRODUCING
THE SIMPLY FIT BOARD.
NOW, WE'VE COMBINED CARDIO
TO BURN OFF THE FAT
WHILE BUILDING MUSCLES AND CORE
STRENGTH AT THE SAME TIME.
JUST STANDING ON THE BOARD,
YOU'RE STRENGTHENING
YOUR CORE, YOUR BACK.
YOU'RE TONING YOUR LEGS, AND
YOU'RE IMPROVING YOUR BALANCE.
BUT LET'S FACE IT --
I WANT A SLIMMER WAISTLINE,
BUT AT MY AGE,
BALANCE IS JUST AS IMPORTANT.
WE CALL THIS
A BALANCE BOARD WITH A TWIST,
BECAUSE WE DEVELOPED IT
USING A SPECIAL PLASTIC
THAT HAS A HIGH LEVEL
OF LUBRICATION IN IT
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TWIST
AT THE SAME TIME.
NOW, TWISTING
NOT ONLY WORKS UP
YOUR HEART RATE
TO BURN OFF THE FAT,
BUT IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY
EXERCISES YOU CAN DO
THAT WORKS EVERY SINGLE MUSCLE
IN YOUR CORE.
NOW, THERE ARE LITERALLY
HUNDREDS OF EXERCISES
THAT YOU CAN DO
ON THE BOARD.
OBVIOUSLY,
THE BASIC TWIST,
BUT YOU CAN ALSO DO SQUATS,
PUSH-UPS, AND EVEN PLANKS.
EVERYONE
CAN BE SIMPLY FIT.
SO, WHICH ONE
OF YOU SHARKS WANTS
TO LOSE THAT MUFFIN TOP
AND GAIN SOME DOUGH?
I WANT TO TRY IT, EVEN THOUGH --
COME ON DOWN.
I WANT TO TRY IT,
EVEN THOUGH...
WE WANT YOU GUYS
TO COME TRY THESE.
...I HAVE
AN ADONIS-LIKE FIGURE.
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR IMPROVEMENT.
HE HAS A BIG MUFFIN TOP.
NOT THAT ANY OF YOU
HAVE MUFFIN TOPS.
Clark: JUST PUT
YOUR FEET ON ONE SIDE...
YEAH, I'LL TRY. YEAH.
...AND THEN ON THE SAME SPOT
ON THE OTHER SIDE,
AND YOU'RE GONNA BALANCE
ON THAT CENTER POINT.
YEAH.
I'M GETTING
A LITTLE FARTHER ADVANCED.
-OKAY, GET THEM SET.
-OH, YOU'RE IN YOUR SOCKS.
-OH, MARK.
-YOU NEED YOUR TENNIS SHOES ON.
I NEED TENNIS SHOES?
I DON'T HAVE TENNIS --
-OH, MY GOD.
-GO GET YOUR SHOES ON.
YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THESE.
THESE MIGHT HELP YOU.
THE MORE YOU GET
THE BOARD TWISTING,
THE MORE YOU'RE GONNA FEEL IT
IN YOUR BACK AND YOUR WAISTLINE.
THESE CAN -- JUST HOLD THEM
STRAIGHT AT YOUR SIDE.
YOU LOOK LIKE
TWO OLD MEN OUT THERE.
OH, MY GOD!
-IS IT HARD TO BALANCE?
-WE HAVE A GUIDE, TOO.
NO, IT'S NOT HARD TO
BALANCE -- YOU JUST SLIDE
IF YOU HAVE YOUR SOCKS ON.
YEAH, YOU'VE --
YOU'VE GOT YOUR SOCKS ON.
I GUESS WE CAN'T DO IT
IN OUR HEELS, CAN WE?
Hoffman: YOU SEE
HOW EASY IT MOVES, THOUGH?
THERE YOU GO!
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
-OH, YOU LITTLE SHOWOFF.
-WATCH OUT.
BUT WHEN YOU GET COMFORTABLE
WITH IT AND YOU GET IT GOING,
IT REALLY, REALLY WORKS UP
THAT HEART RATE.
GOING LIKE A PRO.
-OH, LOOK AT YOU GO.
-MY FEET SLIDE.
-IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
-YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT IT.
LINDA, I'M GETTING DIZZY!
STOP THAT!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, TELL US,
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS?
WELL, WHEN I TURNED 60
A FEW YEARS AGO, I --
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I COULDN'T LOSE
ANY WEIGHT AROUND MY MIDDLE.
AND I'VE HAD FOUR KIDS AND I'M
KIND OF VERTICALLY CHALLENGED
AND LIKE TO EAT.
SO, ONE DAY, I WAS PLAYING OUT
WITH MY GRANDKIDS
ON A SKATEBOARD TOY,
AND I THOUGHT, "MAN,
THIS IS HITTING ME
IN ALL THE RIGHT SPOTS."
I CALLED GLORIA.
WE DID SOME RESEARCH.
WE BRAINSTORMED,
AND THE LIGHT CAME ON,
AND VOILà --
THE SIMPLY FIT BOARD.
O'Leary:
BUT, GLORIA, HOW DOES IT WORK
ON A TYPICAL CARPET
IN SOMEONE'S DEN?
YOU KNOW, IT WORKS
ON ALMOST EVERY --
IT WORKS ON ALL CARPETS.
IT'S A LITTLE MORE --
WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S
ON THE WOOD SURFACE?
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO SCRATCH YOUR WOOD FLOORS,
SO WE DO RECOMMEND
PUTTING SOMETHING DOWN, BUT --
-DO YOU SELL THE MATS, TOO?
-WE DON'T.
WE ACTUALLY
JUST HAVE A PROTOTYPE
MADE OF A PLATFORM
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET MADE,
AND SO THIS IS
ACTUALLY CURVED
SO THAT THEY START
IN THE MIDDLE.
IF THEY MOVE FORWARD A LITTLE,
IT AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTS
THEM BACK.
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?
DO YOU HAVE A PATENT ON THIS?
OUR SYSTEM IS PATENTED,
SO --
-WHAT IS THE SYSTEM?
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THE BOARD
WITH THE PLATFORM.
STANDING THE WAY
YOU ARE RIGHT THERE,
LINDA,
THERE'S NO PATENT ON THAT?
-NO.
-NO.
ONCE I PUT IT
ON THE SPECIAL PLATFORM --
YES.
-SO IT'S THE ATTACHMENT?
-YES, YES.
O'Leary: SO SOMEONE COULD
KNOCK IT OFF SLIGHTLY
AND DO THE SAME THING --
THAT'S THE RISK.
Corcoran: EASILY.
OR THEY COULD JUST COPY IT.
THEY DON'T HAVE A PATENT, KEVIN.
WELL, WHEN YOU HAVE
A PRODUCT LIKE THAT,
WHAT YOU WANT IS YOU WANT TO GET
OUT TO MARKET VERY QUICKLY.
EXACTLY.
SO TELL US
HOW MANY SALES YOU HAVE.
YEAH, AND -- AND WE LAUNCHED
ABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO.
WE HAVE SOLD OVER 15,700 BOARDS,
GROSSED $575,000.
-GOOD FOR YOU.
-HOW MUCH DOES THE BOARD COST?
$45 RETAIL ONLINE.
SO IT COSTS YOU
HOW MUCH TO MAKE?
$9.87.
-WOW!
-YEAH.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE CHEAPEST
BALANCE BOARD ON THE MARKET.
AND DO YOU SELL IT --
DO YOU SELL IT --
YOU SELL IT THROUGH RETAIL?
WE SELL IT
AT CONSUMER SHOWS, MAINLY,
AND THEN ONLINE ON OUR WEBSITE.
GLORIA, ON THE $500,000 YOU
SOLD, WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON THAT?
$260,000.
ARE THERE OTHER
BALANCE BOARDS ON THE MARKET,
AND IF THERE ARE,
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE?
I JUST MET WITH
A LARGE SPORTING GOODS STORE,
AND SHE SAID, "I'M PITCHED
BALANCE BOARDS ALL THE TIME.
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME."
AND THEY'RE BASICALLY
A WOODEN PLANK
WITH A CYLINDER UNDERNEATH.
SHE LOVED THE PRODUCT.
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID,
"WE GET PITCHED ALL THE TIME
ON BALANCE BOARDS.
YOURS LOOKS SO DIFFERENT."
LOOK, THE ISSUE ISN'T,
CAN YOU BE COPIED?
YOU <i>WILL</i> BE COPIED.
-YES.
-RIGHT.
-THE ISSUE IS HOW BIG CAN YOU BE
DESPITE IT?
-YEAH, YES.
O'Leary: EXACTLY.
IT'S NOT GONNA JUST BE
A ONE-PRODUCT SHOW.
GUYS, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
NEED MORE MONEY FOR INVENTORY,
SO I'M GONNA
STEP IT UP A NOTCH HERE.
I WANT TO DO THIS DEAL WITH YOU.
I LIKE IT.
I'LL GIVE YOU $250,000
FOR 30%.
I RARELY GIVE YOU MORE
THAN YOU WANT
AT EXACTLY THE VALUATION.
YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR EVIL WAYS.
...BUT I KIND OF BELIEVE THAT,
BECAUSE OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE,
THAT THIS PRODUCT IS GONNA
FIND A NICHE IN PEOPLE OVER 40.
SO I'M BETTING ON YOU BIG.
I THINK HALF OF THE DOLLARS
I'M GIVING YOU HAS TO GO
IN INVENTORY.
I REALLY DO.
GLORIA, LET ME TELL YOU WHERE
I'M AT -- FANTASTIC PRODUCT.
MY CONCERN IS THERE'S
NOTHING PROPRIETARY HERE.
UM, GREAT IDEA, THOUGH.
I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.
I'M OUT.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
JUST -- ARE THERE
ANY OTHER OFFERS?
THIS IS DEFINITELY A PRODUCT
THAT NEEDS AN INFOMERCIAL,
AND I'VE HAD BAD EXPERIENCE
WITH INFOMERCIALS
ON THESE KINDS OF PRODUCTS,
SO FOR ME, I'M OUT.
Cuban:
GUYS, I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
BUT THE NETWORK
MARKETING-TYPE APPROACH
REALLY ISN'T MY STRENGTH,
SO WHILE I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT PRODUCT,
I DON'T THINK I'M THE BEST
PERSON TO TAKE IT THERE,
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
THIS OBVIOUSLY IS
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.
YOU KNOW
I'M THE QUEEN OF QVC.
I'M THE KING.
HE'S THE JOKER OF QVC.
THE KING OF QVC.
-I LIKE YOU BOTH.
-HE JUST WANTS TO BE THE KING.
THE INFOMERCIAL WORLD
IS ALSO RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE DONE
FOR 18 YEARS, AS WELL.
WE'D HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD
AND QUICKLY,
BECAUSE,
TO EVERYBODY'S POINT,
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT IT.
SO HERE'S MY OFFER.
I'M GONNA OFFER YOU
$125,000 AT 20%.
-THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
-NOT ENOUGH CASH.
NOT ENOUGH CASH.
IF THERE'S MONEY
THAT'S NEEDED,
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY
TO FUND PURCHASE ORDERS.
IT MEANS IT'S WORKING.
SO AS MUCH AS WE GET IN
IN ORDERS
IS AS MUCH AS I WILL HELP
TO BANKROLL.
IT'S TIME
TO MAKE A DECISION.
I'M JUST WONDERING,
BASED ON OUR BACKGROUNDS...
WELL, I'M CURIOUS
IF THEY WOULD --
...WHAT YOU HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT.
FOR GLORIA AND LINDA'S
EXERCISE BOARD, SIMPLY FIT.
ALL RIGHT, GLORIA, YOU'VE GOT
$125,000 FOR 20% FROM LORI,
$250,000 FOR 30%
FROM KEVIN.
DOWN TO TWO OFFERS.
-YOU GUYS HAVE TO GO FAST.
I'M JUST WONDERING,
BASED ON OUR BACKGROUNDS...
WELL, I'M CURIOUS
IF THEY WOULD --
...WHAT YOU HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT.
DO YOU WANT TO --
WOULD YOU GUYS WANT
TO DO A DEAL TOGETHER?
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW MUCH EQUITY --
NO.
I WILL GO SOLO HERE,
BECAUSE THIS IS MY WORLD.
YES.
THIS IS --
THIS IS MY SWEET SPOT.
THIS IS WHAT
I'M EXCELLENT AT.
I MAKE MILLIONAIRES THIS WAY.
IT'S WHAT I DO,
AND I TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.
BUT I DON'T NEED A PARTNER.
GUYS, ANY SHARK CAN GET
YOU INTO ANY RETAILER.
WE'VE ALL DONE DEALS AROUND
EVERY KIND OF PRODUCT CATEGORY.
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO MY ENTREPRENEURS,
ALL WOMEN, THAT HAVE MADE
A FORTUNE WITH ME.
OH, GOOD LORD.
WE LOVE ALL OF YOU GUYS,
AND COMING IN, OF COURSE,
WE THOUGHT QVC WOULD BE
AN INCREDIBLE OUTLET.
IT WILL BE.
WOULD YOU DO 18%?
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT MATTERS
FOR THAT LITTLE BIT
OF DIFFERENCE?
SHE ASKED FOR 20%, RIGHT?
I'M JUST ASKING.
I ASKED FOR 20%.
I THINK IT'S FAIR.
[ BOTH WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ]
Hoffman: YAY!
YOU'VE JUST CHOSEN
THE BEAUTY OVER THE BEAST.
YOU HAVE GREAT TASTE.
OH, I WOULDN'T CALL HIM
A BEAST.
-THANKS, BARB.
-I'M TELLING YOU SERIOUSLY.
-I-I-I LOVE YOU GUYS.
-THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANK YOU. THANKS SO MUCH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-CONGRATULATIONS, LADIES.
-CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
-OH, MY GOD!
-YAY!
Hoffman:
WE LOVE MR. WONDERFUL, BUT LORI
WAS THE ONE TO GO WITH TODAY.
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GONNA
GET AMERICA TWISTING.
WHOO!
BRINGING FUN BACK TO FITNESS.
TWIST IN FRONT OF YOUR TV.
WITH THE SIMPLY FIT BOARD,
OF COURSE!
