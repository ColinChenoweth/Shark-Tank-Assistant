HEY, SHARKS,
MY NAME IS MAXWELL COHEN.
I'M FROM NEW YORK CITY,
AND MY COMPANY IS AfreSHeet.
I'M SEEKING $100,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF MY BUSINESS.
LYDIA HERE, SHE'S A BUSY WOMAN.
SHE'S A FULL-TIME
COLLEGE STUDENT,
HAS A PART-TIME JOB
IN THE EVENING.
WHO HAS TIME
TO WASH THEIR SHEETS?
[ LAUGHS ]
DORM BEDS ARE USED
FOR MORE THAN JUST SLEEPING.
O'Leary:
MAXWELL, WHAT'S IT MADE OF?
IT IS MADE OUT
OF POLYESTER.
DO YOU HAVE SAMPLES
FOR US TO TOUCH?
OF COURSE.
MAX, POLYESTER
DOESN'T BREATHE.
SO, THIS IS THE NEWEST VERSION
OF THE SHEET.
THIS IS MADE OUT OF THREE
DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLYESTER.
IT DOESN'T FEEL GREAT.
DON'T PEOPLE WANT
A SOFT SHEET TO SLEEP ON?
THIS FEELS CLINICAL.
WE'RE NOT COMPETING
WITH EGYPTIAN COTTON.
WE ARE HERE FOR PRACTICALITY
AND CONVENIENCE.
BUT IT DOESN'T BREATHE,
RIGHT?
IT IS VERY BREATHABLE.
[ BLOWS ]
SO, IT'S NOT AS BREATHABLE
AS CONVENTIONAL BED SHEETS.
IT'S NOT BREATHING, MAX.
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN BLOW THROUGH THIS.
KEVIN, IS THAT
A SCIENTIFIC TEST?
[ BLOWS ]
-YEAH.
-IT IS.
IT'S SORT OF LIKE PAPER,
THOUGH,
BECAUSE I JUST POKED
MY FINGER THROUGH IT.
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE
IN SALES?
Herjavec:
YEAH, WHAT HAVE YOU SOLD?
SO, I'VE SOLD A LITTLE OVER
400 AfreSHeetS.
-THE FIRST GENERATION --
-400,000?
NO, 400.
WE'RE JUST A START-UP.
-NO KIDDING.
-HOW MUCH DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
I SELL THEM FOR $29.95
FOR A TWIN EXTRA LONG.
I COULD SEE A BIG MARKET
FOR IT, ACTUALLY.
I MEAN, I'M SURPRISED
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD MORE.
I COULD SEE IT IN HOSPITALS.
-YES.
ANYWHERE WHERE THERE'S MORE
OF A CLINICAL APPLICATION.
YEAH.
HAVE YOU APPROACHED
THOSE KIND OF MARKETS?
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF INTEREST
FROM SUMMER CAMPS,
ELDERLY HOMES.
WE'RE IN THE WORKS WITH A BUNCH
OF THEM RIGHT NOW.
WE WERE JUST
AT A GIANT COLLEGE EXPO.
LOTS OF BUZZ.
-LOTS OF ORDERS?
SO, WE'RE WAITING FOR THE NEWEST
SHIPMENT TO COME IN.
IT IS ON ITS WAY.
WE'RE ACTUALLY HELD UP
IN CUSTOMS RIGHT NOW.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WROTE PURCHASE
ORDERS, THOUGH, AT THE SHOW?
SO, WE'RE SUCH A NEW PRODUCT,
IT'S ONE OF THOSE IDEAS,
IT'S -- YOU HAVE TO WRAP
YOUR HEAD AROUND IT.
AND NOBODY'S CHANGED THE BED
SHEET FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
SO,
THEY DIDN'T ORDER.
SO, NOT YET.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY
IS INTO THIS COMPANY?
SO, I INVESTED
TO START THIS BUSINESS
ALL OF MY BAR MITZVAH MONEY.
HOW MUCH WAS THAT?
I HAD ABOUT
A LITTLE OVER $12,000.
WOW.
WHAT'S IT COST YOU
TO MAKE ONE $29.95 PACKAGE?
THAT ONE
IS A LITTLE OVER $7.
WE'RE WORKING ON NEW BETTER
MATERIALS THAT ARE --
MAX,
THERE'S VERY MANY LARGE
BIG-BOX RETAILERS
THAT SELL SHEETS.
YEAH.
HAVE YOU SHOWN ANY
OF THEM THIS PRODUCT?
SO, I PITCHED SOMEBODY
AT BED BATH &amp; BEYOND.
AND?
THEY DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THE PEOPLE
TO INTRODUCE IT TO THE WORLD.
-OOH.
IT'S NOT AS SOFT
AS THEY WANT IT TO BE.
HMM.
SO, EVERYBODY LOVES THE IDEA,
AND SAID
"THE IDEA IS BRILLIANT."
THEY SAID THE IDEA
IS BRILLIANT.
YEAH, BUT YOUR BUSINESS
IS NOT RETAIL.
-YOUR BUSINESS IS INSTITUTIONAL.
-RIGHT.
SO, OVERSEAS,
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF INTEREST.
WE'VE BEEN
IN SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS
AND SOUTH AFRICAN AMBULANCES.
IN AMERICA, WE'RE NOT PUSHING
TOWARDS HOSPITALS --
HOW BIG IS THE SOUTH AFRICAN
AMBULANCE MARKET?
[ LAUGHTER ]
MAX, YOU'RE FEELING YOUR WAY IN
AND YOU'RE LEARNING AS YOU GO,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE READY FOR AN INVESTMENT,
AND CERTAINLY NOT
MY MONEY.
WITH THAT SAID, I'M OUT.
-HE'S OUT. THANK YOU.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.
Herjavec: MAX,
SOMETIMES PEOPLE COME OUT
AND I THINK, "WOW,
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE."
IS IT BRILLIANT
OR IS IT NOT?
WHICH ONE IS THIS,
ROBERT?
I KNOW YOU'RE COMPARING IT
TO COTTON SHEETS
AND ALL THAT,
BUT THAT'S NOT HIS MARKET.
I MEAN,
I'VE GOT KIDS AT COLLEGE.
THEIR SHEETS ARE A MESS.
THEY WOULD BUY IT
AND RIP IT OFF.
I COULD SEE
ELDERLY HOMES.
WHY AREN'T THOSE PEOPLE
BUYING IT?
'CAUSE, TO ME,
IT SEEMS LIKE A SLAM DUNK.
YOU KNOW WHY
THEY'RE NOT BUYING IT, MAX?
IT'S A DOG.
I LOVE DOGS.
MAX, I'M GONNA
HELP YOU OUT HERE.
I HATE IT.
-PERFECT.
-I'M OUT.
SHOOT IT, BURN IT,
GET RID OF IT,
DO SOMETHING ELSE
WITH YOUR TIME.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
IF IT WAS SOFT
AND COMFORTABLE.
LIKE YOU SAID...
IT WOULD BE CALLED A SHEET
MADE OF COTTON.
...YOU WERE NEXT TO A BOOTH
THAT PROBABLY WAS MICRO FLEECE.
I LIKE SOMETHING
REALLY SOFT.
PEOPLE GO INTO THEIR BEDS
FOR COMFORT.
PEOPLE KNOW THEY HAVE
TO WASH THEIR SHEETS
BUT THEY DON'T
BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZY.
LORI,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT.
I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
CUSTOMERS LIE TO YOU.
THE BEST WAY TO GET RID OF
A SALESMAN IS TO TELL THEM WHAT?
-HOW TO GET RID OF A SALESMAN?
-YEAH.
YOU ACT LIKE MR. WONDERFUL
AND TELL THEM THEY'RE TERRIBLE.
NO.
NO, BECAUSE THEN
THEY KEEP OBJECTING.
THE BEST WAY
TO GET RID OF A SALESMAN
IS TO TELL THEM WHAT
THEY THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR --
THAT THEY MIGHT
BE GETTING AN ORDER.
GOT IT.
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY ORDERS.
YOU'VE TESTED THE MARKET AND
THE MARKET'S SPEAKING TO YOU.
OH, THEY LOVE IT.
THEY LOVE IT.
-PEOPLE LOVE IT.
-WELL, NO, THEY DON'T LOVE IT.
THEY'RE NOT BEING GENEROUS.
IF THEY LOVED IT,
THEY WOULD BUY IT.
I GOT TO GO OUT BECAUSE
THE MARKET'S TELLING YOU THAT.
-THAT'S IT.
-THAT'S IT. THANKS, GUYS.
-GOOD LUCK. APPRECIATE IT.
-GOOD LUCK.
MAX, SHOOT IT.
-YOU LOVE IT.
-BEHIND THE BARN.
-THANKS, MR. WONDERFUL.
-MAX, THANK YOU.
-BYE.
-MAX, GOOD LUCK.
Cohen: I BELIEVE THIS IS
AN IDEA OF A LIFETIME.
IS IT A LITTLE HEARTBREAKING?
YEAH.
IS IT THEIR LOSS?
YEAH.
AM I EXCITED FOR THE FUTURE?
OH, YEAH.
