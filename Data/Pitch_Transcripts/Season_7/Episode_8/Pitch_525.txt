MY NAME IS BRYCE HUDSON, AND
I LIVE IN MURRIETA, CALIFORNIA.
I STARTED RIDING MOTORCYCLES
WHEN I WAS ABOUT 13 YEARS OLD.
I WAS KIND OF ALWAYS
THE HOTSHOT KID
THAT WOULD DO THE JUMPS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
NOW I'M A PROFESSIONAL
FREESTYLE MOTOCROSS RIDER
AND I COMPETE IN THE X GAMES.
THE X GAMES IS BASICALLY
THE OLYMPICS FOR ACTION SPORTS.
I COMPETE IN MOTO X STEP UP,
WHICH IS BASICALLY
POLE VAULTING ON A MOTORCYCLE.
SO YOU HAVE TO JUMP UP
AND OVER A HIGH BAR.
HELLO, SHARKS,
MY NAME IS BRYCE HUDSON.
I'M FROM MURRIETA, CALIFORNIA,
AND MY COMPANY IS GRIP CLEAN.
I'M SEEKING $85,000 IN EXCHANGE
FOR 20% OF MY COMPANY.
NOW, SHARKS, I KNOW DIRT.
WHETHER I'M OUT COMPETING
ON MY MOTORCYCLE
IN THE X GAMES,
TRYING TO WIN MORE MEDALS
TO ADD MORE MEDALS TO ADD
TO MY COLLECTION,
OR WHETHER I'M IN THE GARAGE
WORKING ON MY MOTORCYCLE,
I'M ALWAYS AROUND DIRT,
GREASE, AND GRIME.
AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS,
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SAFE
AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCT
TO THOROUGHLY CLEANSE MY HANDS.
SO, I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE DIRT
TO FIGHT DIRT.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT --
DIRT JUST LIKE THE KIND
YOU WOULD FIND OUTSIDE.
SO, YOU'RE PROBABLY
ASKING YOURSELF
WHY WOULD YOU PUT DIRT IN SOAP?
SOUNDS KIND OF CRAZY.
TURNS OUT THAT DIRT
IS ACTUALLY THE BEST SUBSTANCE
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
AT ABSORBING GREASE, OILS,
CHEMICALS, AND TOXINS.
BUT ON TOP OF THAT,
IT REALLY ACTS AS AN EXFOLIANT
TOWARDS YOUR SKIN.
SO, WHERE GREASE WOULD NORMALLY
REMAIN DEEP IN THE PORES
OF YOUR HANDS,
IT'S ABLE TO REALLY GO IN THERE,
LATCH AND HOLD ON
TO THAT GREASE AND RINSE CLEAN.
GRIP CLEAN IS PERFECT
FOR AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICS,
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS,
FARMERS, LANDSCAPERS,
OR SIMPLY ANYBODY WHO GETS DIRTY
AND NEEDS TO GET CLEAN.
SO, I CREATED THIS IN MY GARAGE,
AND SEVERAL MONTHS LATER,
AND TWO VERY CLEAN HANDS LATER,
I FEEL MY PRODUCT IS UNIQUE
AND A WINNER.
SO, SHARKS,
WHO WANTS TO GET CLEAN
BY GETTING DIRTY
WITH GRIP CLEAN?
BRYCE,
YOU WENT TO THE X GAMES?
I DID, YES, I HAVE --
WHAT DID YOU WIN?
ARE THOSE MEDALS?
YEAH, OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS,
I'VE ACQUIRED THREE MEDALS.
AND WHAT EVENT
ARE YOU IN?
STEP UP -- MOTOCROSS HIGH JUMP,
BASICALLY POLE VAULTING
ON A MOTORCYCLE.
-YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL, HUH?
-WOW.
-REAL DEAL.
-YOU EVER HURT YOURSELF BAD?
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF WHY I'M
TRYING TO START A COMPANY HERE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU
AND, LIKE,
A LAVA OR A GOOP?
VERY GOOD QUESTION.
IS IT JUST
THE ALL-NATURAL ELEMENT?
YES,
THE ALL-NATURAL ASPECT.
MOST MECHANICS ARE WASHING
MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY.
THEIR HANDS WILL BREAK OUT
IN A RASH.
SO, WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
WITH CHEMICALS ALL DAY,
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO USE
IS ANOTHER
CHEMICALLY INFUSED SOAP
TO TAKE THOSE CHEMICALS OFF.
THE DIRT THAT'S ACTUALLY
IN THERE,
IT'S ALL COSMETIC-GRADE CLAY.
-OKAY, WHAT ELSE IS IN IT?
SO, IT'S A COCONUT OIL
AND OLIVE OIL BASED HAND SOAP.
AND THEN YOU ADD THE CLAY
TO BE THE EXFOLIANT
TO HELP GET ALL THE GREASE.
-CORRECT.
-CAN I TRY IT?
-I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TRY IT.
I CAME A LONG WAY, SO I'D LOVE
FOR YOU TO TRY IT.
IS THIS DIRT?
YES, IT IS.
-"IS THIS DIRT?"
-IS THIS DIRT?
WELL, IS THIS YOUR DIRT?
IS THIS WHAT'S --
IS THAT WHAT'S IN IT?
THAT IS THE EXACT STUFF
THAT I PUT IN IT.
JUST USE IT
AS YOU WOULD A REGULAR SOAP.
WATER ACTIVATED.
SO, I LIKE TO SCRUB IT
ON MY HANDS QUITE A BIT.
-OH, IT'S REALLY THICK.
-YEAH, IT IS.
'CAUSE ANOTHER COMPLAINT
THAT I HAD
WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER SOAPS
IS THEY WERE REALLY ABRASIVE,
SO IF YOU WERE USING IT
MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY,
IT'D REALLY EAT YOUR HANDS UP.
-SO I TRIED TO MAKE --
-OH, WOW.
-IT TRULY WORKS, AND --
-OH, MY GOSH.
HONESTLY, SURPRISINGLY,
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
DID YOU GET ANY RETAIL
DISTRIBUTION ON THIS?
I HAVEN'T.
I'M A PRE-REVENUE COMPANY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DISTRIBUTION
CHANNELS SET UP NOW?
YES, I HAVE ABOUT
FIVE LOCAL MOTORCYCLE SHOPS
THAT ARE READY
TO SELL IT RIGHT NOW.
WHAT PRICE POINT
ARE YOU GONNA SELL IT AT?
WHAT -- WHAT DOES IT
COST YOU TO MAKE IT?
COSTS ME $2.12 TO MAKE
THE BOTTLE, PACKAGE,
DONE, EVERYTHING.
WHOLESALE IT AT $5,
RETAIL AT STORES FOR $8.99.
AND WHAT'S YOUR
COMPETITOR SELL FOR?
COMPETITORS RETAIL
FROM ANYWHERE FROM $5 TO $8
DEPENDING ON WHERE
THEY'RE SELLING.
SO, THIS IS EXPENSIVE
FOR YOU TO MAKE.
IT IS. YES, IT IS.
THE MORE I CAN PRODUCE
OF THIS, OBVIOUSLY,
MY MARGINS ARE GONNA BE
BETTER AND BETTER.
RIGHT, HOW LOW
CAN YOU GET THE COST?
I FEEL THAT ANYTHING
OVER 5,000 UNITS,
I CAN GET IT DOWN TO $1.80,
AND THEN PUSHING
ANYTHING OVER 10,000,
I FEEL I CAN GET IT DOWN
TO $1.25.
SO, 10,000 UNITS,
YOUR WHOLESALE IS 5 BUCKS.
-MM-HMM.
-THAT'S ONLY $50,000 IN SALES.
-MM-HMM.
-THAT'S NOT A BUSINESS.
IF YOU PLANNED OUT A WAY
THAT YOU CAN GET
TO 100,000 UNITS
IN SALES PER YEAR,
AND THEN WHAT WOULD
YOUR COSTS BE?
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
YES, I HAVE PLANNED IT OUT.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
I WANT TO MAKE
MORE BOTTLES UP
TO THE $100,000 RANGE.
BUT YOU GOT
TO KNOW THE NUMBERS.
TO BREAK A DOLLAR
FOR COST OF GOODS,
HOW MANY UNITS
DO YOU HAVE TO ORDER?
I WOULD HAVE
TO ORDER 20,000 UNITS.
-20,000 UNITS.
-THAT'S IT?
-YES.
-TO GET UNDER A DOLLAR.
YES.
Herjavec: BRYCE,
IN SEASON ONE, BARBARA AND I
DID A DEAL WITH A PRODUCT
CALLED GREASE MONKEY.
-YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT.
-I REMEMBER THAT.
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER THAT.
I REMEMBER WATCHING THAT.
AND WHAT IT WAS -- IT WAS
A VERY NATURAL PRODUCT
THAT CLEANED OIL.
-WORKED GREAT.
-MM-HMM.
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD LOOK
AT THIS IN STORES AND SAY,
"OH, MY GOSH, HERE'S A CHEMICAL
ONE, HERE'S A NATURAL ONE.
LET ME BUY THE NATURAL."
BUT WE FOUND THAT CONSUMERS
DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH.
-HMM.
-YOU KNOW, LISTEN.
YOU KNOW, TO GO OUT THERE
AND WIN THOSE AWARDS,
I'M SURE THAT YOU ARE
SOUGHT AFTER
IN YOUR MARKET
FOR VARIOUS THINGS.
YOU MAY HAVE
A GREAT MACHINE BEHIND YOU.
I MEAN, YOU COULD BE TONY HAWK
OF THIS AREA.
I REALLY WANT TO TARGET
THE MOTORCYCLE INDUSTRY
IN A SENSE BECAUSE I HAVE
A CREDIBLE NAME IN THAT ASPECT.
-ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.
-AS YOU SHOULD.
SO, IF YOU'RE GOOD AT SOMETHING,
GO FULL FORCE WITH THAT.
YEP, YEAH.
SO, I HAVE A TEAM
OF FRIENDS BEHIND ME.
ARE YOU MAKING IT -- ARE YOU
MANUFACTURING IT AT HOME?
ARE YOU DOMESTICALLY --
YES, OUT OF MY GARAGE
RIGHT NOW.
OUT OF YOUR GARAGE?
YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
IS I'M MAKING IT
OUT OF A FIVE-GALLON BUCKET
RIGHT NOW.
-YOU REALLY ARE?
-I TRULY AM, AND THAT'S WHY --
THAT'S AWESOME.
GOOD FOR YOU, BABY.
I MEAN, I CAN'T SELL IT
TO THE BIGGER SHOPS
BECAUSE IT'LL TAKE ME
10 YEARS TO MAKE 100 BOTTLES.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING ELSE.
HAVE YOU TRIED SOCIAL MEDIA?
IT'S NOT REALLY WORKING OUT,
AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY.
IT'S BECAUSE NO ONE REALLY WANTS
TO BUY THIS PRODUCT ONLINE.
THEY WANT TO GO
TO HOME DEPOT...
THAT'S TRUE.
...WHEN THEY'RE BUYING ALL
THEIR SUPPLIES AND EVERYTHING.
-THEY WANT IT FASTER.
-YEAH, THEY WANT IT NOW.
LOOK, I ADMIRE ANYBODY
WHO'S AN ATHLETE.
I MEAN, IT TAKES AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF DISCIPLINE TO DO THIS.
I CAN SENSE
YOU'RE GOING OUT HERE, ROBERT.
WELL, I'VE BEEN DOWN
THIS ROAD WITH GREASE MONKEY,
AND WHAT I LEARNED OUT OF IT IS,
YOU KNOW, AS MARK ALWAYS SAYS,
IT'S A HARD WAY TO GRIND
YOUR WAY TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
AND MAYBE I KNOW TOO MUCH.
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WHY
DID YOU GET IN YOUR BUSINESS?
I'M LIKE I'M GLAD
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I KNOW NOW...
RIGHT.
...'CAUSE I WOULD'VE
NEVER GOT INTO IT.
IN THIS CASE,
MAYBE I KNOW TOO MUCH.
I'M -- I'M OUT.
STILL FOUR SHARKS LEFT.
-GOT IT.
I RESPECT THAT.
-YEAH.
BRYCE, LOOK, YOU'RE DOING
A LOT OF GREAT THINGS,
BUT YOU'RE NOT
A COMPANY YET.
YOU CAN'T DO THE VOLUME.
-YOU GOT TO, BRYCE.
Cuban: YOU GOT TO.
YEAH, WHY -- WHY WOULD YOU
BUILD IT ON YOUR OWN?
YEAH.
I TRIED --
I USED EVERY CREDIBLE SOURCE
THAT I HAD ABOUT A YEAR AGO
TRYING TO FIND MANUFACTURERS
TO MAKE THIS FOR ME.
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU TRIED
TO FIND MANUFACTURERS?
WELL, WHEN I SAID, "HEY, I WANT
TO PUT DIRT AS AN ACTIVE
INGREDIENT,"
SAID, "HEY, WE DON'T WANT
DIRT IN OUR SHOP
CONTAMINATING
ANYTHING WE'VE HAD."
OKAY, SO THAT WAS
OUT OF THE QUESTION.
CONTAMINATING WHAT?
SO, BRYCE,
THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS.
Cuban: YEAH.
BECAUSE YOU --
IN ORDER TO DO THIS
AND ACTUALLY GO
TO A LARGE DISTRIBUTOR
OR A BIG-BOX PLAYER THAT'S GONNA
ORDER 100,000 UNITS...
MM-HMM.
...YOU CAN'T DO IT
IN YOUR GARAGE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AS HARD
OF A PROCESS
AS YOU WOULD THINK
TO MANUFACTURE IT.
ALL I REALLY NEED THE MONEY FOR
IS 55-GALLON DRUMS
AND A MIXING HEAD.
I HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS,
I THROW IT IN THERE --
NO, MAN.
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT
TO BOTTLE.
YOU'VE GOT TO BOTTLE EACH ONE,
YOU'VE GOT TO LABEL EACH ONE.
IF YOU START SELLING TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS --
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO
PRODUCE, IN A SENSE. I GET IT.
YOU KNOW, BRYCE,
I LISTEN TO THIS STORY.
I JUST DON'T SEE ENOUGH MEAT
ON THE BONE TO INVEST IN.
GOOD LUCK.
I'M OUT.
WHEN YOU SAY THAT NOBODY
WILL MANUFACTURE IT FOR YOU,
THAT'S VERY CONCERNING
TO ME BECAUSE PEOPLE
WOULD LOVE TO MANUFACTURE
A NEW PRODUCT
IF YOU'RE
GONNA PAY THEM.
OF COURSE.
SO, WHY IS IT THAT THEY DON'T
WANT TO MANUFACTURE?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?
YOU KNOW, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
THAT I REALLY HAD
WAS I DIDN'T FEEL PEOPLE
TOOK ME SERIOUSLY.
I -- I MEAN, I SET UP A COUPLE
MEETINGS WITH THESE PLANTS,
AND THEY'RE BIG,
MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR PLANTS
AND I WAS THIS KID COMING IN.
BUT I FEEL IF YOU KNEW
A MANUFACTURING PLANT
OR IF EVEN YOU SET
UP A MEETING WITH ME,
YOU BRING SO MUCH MORE
OF A CREDIBLE SOURCE THERE
THAT THEY COULD BE LIKE,
"ALL RIGHT,
LET-- LET'S DO THIS."
UM...
IT'S A TOUGH ONE, LORI.
IT FITS WITHIN MY FAMILY
OF PRODUCTS, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, IT'S --
I THINK IT'S GREAT.
I LIKE THE FACT
THAT IT'S NATURAL.
I THINK PEOPLE CARE.
I KNOW THAT A LOT OF MEN
AND WOMEN,
THEIR HANDS ARE RIPPED RAW
WITH PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE...
VERY TRUE.
...BECAUSE THERE'S JUST
TOO STRONG OF SOAPS IN THEM.
MM-HMM.
SO, THIS IS A GREAT IDEA
AND A GREAT CONCEPT.
LOOK, I'LL TAKE A FLIER ON YOU.
-YEAH.
BUT HONESTLY,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED ME
TO REALLY RUN
THE WHOLE BUSINESS.
I MEAN,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO COME IN
AND HELP YOU TO GET
THIS OUT THERE EVERYWHERE,
WHICH I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT WE CAN DO.
BUT WE HAVE TO REVISE
YOUR PACKAGING, LABELING.
WE HAVE TO FIND YOU
A MANUFACTURER AND EVERYTHING.
SO, I'LL GIVE YOU THE $85,000,
BUT FOR 35%.
DEAL.
-OH, OKAY.
-BAM!
-DEAL. THAT'S IT.
-THERE YOU GO.
John: ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE IT.
I WON'T MESS AROUND.
-ALL RIGHT, GOOD JOB.
-ALL RIGHT, WELL, GOOD.
I APPRECIATE IT.
WE'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
LORI, GET ON THE BACK
OF THAT BIKE.
[ Laughing ] NO! NO.
O'Leary: YOU DID GREAT TODAY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
[ SIGHS ]
THAT WAS CLOSE.
I'M SO THANKFUL LORI
TOOK A SHOT ON ME.
I MEAN, I'M A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR
AND SHE WAS IN THE SAME POSITION
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER,
AND, UH, HOPEFULLY
I CAN PROVE HER RIGHT
AND, UH,
FOLLOW IN HER FOOTSTEPS.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
IS A COMPANY THAT STRIVES
TO MAKE ALL YOUR VIDEOS
LOOK PROFESSIONAL.
