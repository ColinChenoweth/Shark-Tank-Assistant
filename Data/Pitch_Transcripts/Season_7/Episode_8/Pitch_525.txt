FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
WITH A SOLUTION TO THE DREADED
CHORE OF DOING LAUNDRY.
THEY'RE USED AS A KITCHEN,
A DESK, A DINING ROOM TABLE --
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.
LUCKILY FOR LYDIA,
SHE SLEEPS ON AfreSHeet.
AfreSHeet'S THE WORLD'S FIRST
AND ONLY FITTED BED SHEET
WITH PEEL-AWAY
DISPOSABLE TOP LAYERS.
WHEN YOU SOIL YOUR BED...
...YOU PEEL OFF THAT LAYER
TO INSTANTLY REVEAL A BRAND-NEW
LAYER BENEATH.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ CHUCKLES ]
OH, AND THIS MESS?
YOU THROW IT RIGHT
IN THE RECYCLING BIN.
HEY, IF THERE HAPPENS TO BE
ANOTHER MESS, DO NOT PANIC.
AfreSHeet'S GOT SEVEN PEEL-AWAY,
DISPOSABLE TOP LAYERS.
THERE IS SO MANY DIFFERENT USES
FOR AfreSHeet, SO MOM,
DON'T SEND YOUR KID OFF
TO COLLEGE
HOPING ONE DAY
THEY'LL WASH THEIR SHEET.
AfreSHeet.
TODDLER'S NOT FEELING WELL
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?
AfreSHeet.
FRIEND'S COMING TO VISIT?
AfreSHeet.
SHARKS, I STARTED THIS COMPANY
WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE
AND I'VE POURED A LOT OF BLOOD,
SWEAT, AND TEARS INTO THIS
BUSINESS.
FORTUNATELY FOR ME, I CAN PEEL
IT ALL AWAY WITH AfreSHeet.
[ CHUCKLES ]
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME'S NATE BARBERA.
AND I'M DES STOLAR.
AND WE'RE TEAM UNSHRINKIT
FROM BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.
AND, TODAY, WE'RE ASKING
FOR $150,000
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
TO HELP US GROW OUR BUSINESS.
TODAY, WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.
SHRINKAGE.
CLOTHING SHRINKAGE,
THAT IS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TELL THEM, DES.
MY SISTER
SAVED UP HER MONEY
TO GIVE ME
A GORGEOUS CASHMERE SWEATER.
I LOVED IT, I TREASURED IT,
AND THEN...
I SHRUNK IT.
WITH THE HELP OF CHEMISTRY,
WE'VE DEVELOPED A REVOLUTIONARY
NEW PRODUCT
THAT RELAXES WOOL FIBERS
AND ALLOWS THEM TO BE RETURNED
BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL SIZE.
NOW, LET US SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.
UNSHRINKIT WORKS
IN FOUR SIMPLE STEPS.
STEP ONE -- ADD UNSHRINKIT
TO A GALLON OF WATER.
STEP TWO --
ADD YOUR SWEATERS
AND LET THEM SOAK
FOR 30 MINUTES.
NOW, STEP THREE
IS THAT YOU RINSE OFF
THE SOLUTION
IN COLD RUNNING WATER.
UNSHRINKIT IS COLOR SAFE
AND HAND SAFE.
THE FOURTH AND FINAL STEP
IS THAT YOU RE-SHAPE
THAT FAVORITE GARMENT BACK
TO THE DESIRED SIZE,
AND THEN YOU LAY IT FLAT
TO DRY.
AND BY THE TIME
THAT SWEATER DRIES,
THE WOOL FIBERS HAVE LOCKED
BACK INTO THEIR ORIGINAL
ELONGATED CONFIGURATION
AND HAVE PERMANENTLY SAVED
YOUR SWEATER.
NOW, UNSHRINKIT WORKS
ON MERINO, CASHMERE,
LAMB'S WOOL, SMART WOOL,
YOU NAME IT.
SHARKS,
I AM STANDING HERE WEARING
THAT EXACT CASHMERE SWEATER
THAT I SAVED USING UNSHRINKIT.
I LOOK GOOD, DON'T I?
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT WAS ONCE
AN UNFIXABLE LAUNDRY MISTAKE
IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM
WITH UNSHRINKIT.
IT IS LITERALLY
THE EMERGENCY SWEATER SAVER.
SO, SHARKS,
WHO'S READY TO MAKE A DEAL?
DES, HOW DO YOU STOP IT
FROM OVER GETTING BIG?
Greiner: YEAH, I WAS GONNA --
SO, THE WOOL FIBERS
WERE ALREADY MANUFACTURED
TO A CERTAIN LENGTH,
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS
RETURNING IT TO THE LENGTH
IN WHICH IT WAS MANUFACTURED
AND NO MORE.
John: BUT I'M THINKING, LIKE,
IF SOMEBODY REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO CARE
FOR THEIR CLOTHES,
WHY WOULD THEY THINK
THEY'RE GONNA NEED THIS?
THIS IS KIND OF
AN AFTER A FACT.
RIGHT, SO, ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT BROUGHT US
TO THIS SPACE ALTOGETHER
WAS THAT I SHRUNK THAT SWEATER,
AND I'M THINKING I'M SURE
THERE'S SOME SORT OF SOLUTION
ON THE MARKET FOR THIS.
I STARTED LOOKING,
AND THERE'S NOTHING --
NO SORT OF COMMERCIALIZED REMEDY
FOR THIS.
BUT WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS
THAT THERE WERE MILLIONS
OF YouTube VIEWS OF PEOPLE
LOOKING AT VIDEOS --
DO IT YOURSELF.
CAN YOU TRY TO FIX THIS?
ARE THERE HOME REMEDIES?
SO, KNOWING
THAT THERE WAS A MARKET THERE,
THOUSANDS OF WEB PAGES,
MILLIONS OF YouTube VIEWS,
I GOT BACK TO SCHOOL,
PARTNERED WITH SOME PEOPLE,
AND SAID, "WE SHOULD
ACTUALLY CREATE SOMETHING."
AND WE'VE SOLD 5,000 UNITS,
GENERATING $35,000 IN SALES.
ARE YOU IN CHEMISTRY?
WHAT'S
YOUR BACKGROUND?
NO, SO ACTUALLY NONE
OF US ARE CHEMISTS.
I'M A MECHANICAL ENGINEER
BY BACKGROUND.
WHEN DES CAME TO ME WITH THIS
PROBLEM, I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I CAN FIGURE THIS OUT."
I'VE GOT A FEW PATENTS
FROM MY TIME WORKING
AT JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON DOING
MEDICAL DEVICE DEVELOPMENT.
I'M A PROBLEM SOLVER.
I LIKE HOW YOU
JUST THREW THAT IN.
John: WAIT A MINUTE.
I LIKE HOW YOU
JUST THREW THAT IN.
WAS THIS DEVELOPED WHILE
YOU WERE WORKING THERE?
NO, THIS WAS DEVELOPED WHILE
WE WERE IN BUSINESS SCHOOL.
WHICH SCHOOL?
-HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.
-HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.
WHAT'S PROPRIETARY
IN IT?
THIS IS ACTUALLY NATIVE WOOL
THAT'S PULLED STRAIGHT
OFF OF A LAMB.
AND IT'S ACTUALLY ALL CURLY.
-PASS THAT TO KEVIN.
-HERE, KEVIN.
HE HASN'T FELT HAIR
FOR A LONG TIME.
PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-SO, YOU'RE --
-KEVIN, YOU CAN KEEP SOME.
SORRY, NATE,
I CUT YOU OFF.
SO, THERE'S ACTUALLY
A PROTEIN BOND
THAT KEEPS THOSE FIBERS
IN A CURLED CONFIGURATION.
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR SWEATER
AND YOU THROW IT
IN THE WASHER AND DRYER,
IT ACTUALLY BREAKS THOSE BONDS.
THE HOT WATER
AND THE AGITATION BREAKS IT
AND ALLOWS YOUR SWEATER
TO CURL BACK UP.
SO, OUR CHEMISTRY IS
THAT OUR PRODUCT ACTUALLY BREAKS
THAT BOND CHEMICALLY
AND ALLOWS YOU
TO RE-SHAPE YOUR SWEATER.
THE CHEMICAL IS ACTUALLY
A FAIRLY COMMON COMPOUND,
BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN USED
AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING
THAT'S BEEN USED
TO UNSHRINK WOOL.
SO, WE'VE PATENTED
THE METHOD AND USE.
Greiner: BUT THE THING IS
IF YOU BUY A WOOL ITEM...
YES.
...AND YOU CARE FOR IT PROPERLY,
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO --
-NO, IT STILL SHRINKS.
-RIGHT.
AND GOD BLESS YOU IF YOU DO.
WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT --
O'Leary:
SO, YOU'RE SAYING PEOPLE
MAKE THE MISTAKE ENOUGH
THAT A BIG MARKET EXISTS
FOR THIS SOLUTION?
45% OF AMERICANS ARE
ACTUALLY DOING THIS EACH YEAR.
John: HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
A LOT OF THE WOOL
BEING BOUGHT AND PROCESSED
WILL NOT SHRINK IN THE WAY
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
SO THE 40% YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT IS REALLY ABOUT 12%.
HOW -- HOW LARGE
DO YOU THINK THE MARKET IS?
GIVE ME A DOLLAR AMOUNT.
-YES.
-$200 MILLION.
-$200 MILLION?
AND TELL ME ABOUT THE $200
MILLION AND HOW YOU GET IT.
ALL RIGHT, SO TWO THINGS.
THE FIRST THING IS
THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY
SEE THIS AS A REACTIVE PRODUCT,
IN WHICH YOU PURCHASE IT
ONLY BECAUSE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE.
AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED,
THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING
AKIN TO ASPIRIN.
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE
THINKING THIS IS
IN YOUR CLOSET
OR YOUR LAUNDRY ROOM.
IN TERMS OF PROJECTIONS,
WE'RE LOOKING AT $130,000
THIS UPCOMING YEAR.
YOU BELIEVE YOU'LL DO
$130,000 THIS YEAR? OKAY.
YES, YES, 20,000 UNITS.
RIGHT.
OKAY, SO HERE'S
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, BUT WHERE
IS IT GOING TO THE $135,000?
-MARK.
-WHAT ABOUT THE RETAIL?
WHERE IS -- YOU'RE TELLING US
WHERE IT'S GOING NOW.
FOR THIS UPCOMING -- RIGHT.
WE HAD RETAILERS
THAT WERE READY FOR US
AS EARLY AS SEPTEMBER,
BUT WE WEREN'T READY FOR THAT.
WHAT KIND OF RETAILERS
WERE READY FOR YOU?
SO, WE'RE LOOKING
AT JO-ANN FABRICS,
WE'RE LOOKING AT MACY'S,
LOOKING AT J.C. PENNEY --
LOOKING AT?
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THEM
OR ARE THEY LOOKING AT YOU?
IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH.
SO WHEN WE LAUNCHED, WE ACTUALLY
HAD A LOT OF OUTREACH
FROM RETAILERS, AND WE SAID,
"LOOK, WE'RE NOT READY YET.
WE DON'T HAVE THE INVENTORY."
Herjavec: ALL RIGHT,
SO HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
SO, WE RETAIL $12 TO $15.
-WHOA.
-WE MAKE IT FOR ABOUT $1.
WHY ARE YOU SELLING IT
FOR $12 TO $15?
Stolar:
SO, WHEN WE FIRST LAUNCHED,
WE WERE ACTUALLY SELLING IT
FOR $9.99,
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS FAIR
GIVEN THAT THE AVERAGE RANGE
OF PRICE
ON THE LAUNDRY AISLE
WAS ANYWHERE
FROM ABOUT $4 TO ABOUT $12.
SO, THEN WE STARTED
TO GET FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE,
AND THEY WOULD SAY,
"OH, MY GOSH,
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAVED THIS.
I WOULD'VE PAID THREE TIMES
AS MUCH.
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SAVE
THIS CASHMERE SWEATER.
IT'S BEEN
IN THE BACK OF MY CLOSET.
YOU'RE UNDER-VALUING
YOUR PRODUCT."
THEN WE HEARD FROM INVESTORS,
AND THEY SAID,
"WE REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD BE CHARGING MORE."
THERE'S AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
WITH A LOT OF WOOL GARMENTS,
AND A LOT OF THE THINGS
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SAVE,
THEY HAVE --
THEY'RE BELOVED TO THEM.
NATE, WOULD YOU CALL THIS A
PRODUCT OR A BUSINESS RIGHT NOW?
IT'S RIGHT ON THE CUSP,
I WOULD SAY.
OKAY, IF THIS IS
REALLY TURNING INTO A BUSINESS,
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS THE CEO?
-OH, I LIKE THAT.
-WOW, THAT WAS GOOD.
TO ME,
THE BEST THINGS ARE
WHEN YOU HAVE A SOLUTION
TO A PROBLEM.
BUT THE PROBLEM FOR ME IS --
IS I THINK
YOU HAVE A VERY,
VERY LIMITED MARKET.
I DON'T THINK THAT WOOL
AND WOOL PRODUCTS ARE
THAT COMMONLY BOUGHT.
NOT LIKE COTTON PRODUCTS.
THEN A PERSON HAS TO HAVE SHRUNK
IT TO THEN NEED YOUR PRODUCT,
SO NOW THAT MAKES YOU
EVEN SMALLER.
I DON'T SEE THIS
SCALING UP REALLY HUGE.
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.
NATE, I ACTUALLY THINK
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I THINK
THAT THE TARGET MARKET
IS PEOPLE WHO ARE
ON A RELATIVELY LIMITED BUDGET.
HOW BIG DID YOU SAY
THIS CAN BE IN A YEAR OR TWO?
WE BELIEVE, IN TWO YEARS,
WE CAN HAVE $1.5 MILLION
IN SALES.
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $150,000
FOR 33.3%.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S WORTH,
BUT I LIKE IT.
I LIKE THE IDEA.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.
WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.
UM, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE EQUITY
THAN WE WERE INTERESTED IN --
YEAH, THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES
IN THE SHARK TANK.
HOW MUCH EQUITY
WERE YOU INTERESTED IN...
UH, SO, I MEAN, I WOULD COUNTER
FOR $150,000 FOR 15%.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
THERE'S NO OTHER OFFER.
CERTAINLY YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT, NATE.
ROBERT, MARK, DAYMOND?
NATE AND DES HAVE ONE OFFER
ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR WOOL SHRINKAGE
SOLUTION UNSHRINKIT.
THERE'S NO OTHER OFFER.
ROBERT, MARK, DAYMOND?
John:
WE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
AT FUBU WITH SHRINKAGE,
ACTUALLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH, UM...
MY THING IS THAT I DON'T WANT
TO GROW THIS BUSINESS.
I'M INTERESTED
IN LICENSING THIS.
I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE 25%
OF THIS FOR 150K
CONTINGENT ON US GOING
AND GETTING A LICENSE.
SO, THAT'S MY DEAL,
'CAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW
TO EDUCATE THE WORLD ON THIS.
Stolar: SURE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THEY KNOW IT'S NEEDED.
SO, HE DOESN'T THINK
YOU CAN BUILD A BRAND
IS WHAT HE'S SAYING.
GUYS, OBVIOUSLY
I'M NOT A CLOTHES GUY.
BUT YOU'RE SMART.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU OBVIOUSLY
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.
SO, I'LL DO THE 150K
FOR 15%.
GOT A DEAL?
-DES?
-YES.
-THINK WE GOT A DEAL.
-DONE.
-MARK.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MARK.
I REALLY CAN'T WAIT TO WORK
WITH YOU.
-OH, IT'LL BE A LOT OF FUN.
-PITTSBURGH GUY.
MARK, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
DES, YES!
SO, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
CONSIDERING MY OFFER?
-I'M SORRY, DAYMOND.
-DAYMOND, I'M SORRY.
-MONEY BAGS.
-I'LL GO DOWN TO 30%.
Stolar: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE GUIDANCE.
-GOOD LUCK.
-DES. YES!
-I THOUGHT MARK WAS GOING OUT.
-I DID, TOO.
AND THEN HE GAVE US THE OFFER.
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH."
LIKE, THIS IS IT.
HE GAVE US WHAT I ASKED FOR.
I MEAN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
-WE'RE HERE. WE'RE DONE.
-WE'RE DONE.
-CHECK IT OUT.
-AMAZING.
CONGRATS, D.J.
YOU EXCITED?
I AM PSYCHED.
"SHARK TANK"
IS BACK AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
TODAY, WE'RE HERE FOR A GLOBAL
ENTREPRENEURSHIP EVENT
HIGHLIGHTING MILLENNIAL
ENTREPRENEURS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.
WE'RE ALSO HERE TO SUPPORT
OUR VERY OWN DAYMOND JOHN

THE PRESIDENTIAL AMBASSADOR
FOR GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
Man: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
[ APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE HAVE A LOT
OF BRAIN POWER HERE.
WE'VE GOT INNOVATORS
AND INVESTORS.
WE'VE EVEN GOT A FEW SHARKS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MARK AND DAYMOND AND BARBARA.
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO MAKE IT
EASIER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE
TO START A NEW BUSINESS
OR A NEW SOCIAL VENTURE.
I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE
THAT AMERICA'S BUSINESS LEADERS
AND INNOVATORS ARE JOINING US
IN THIS EFFORT.
SO, I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF OUR GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AMBASSADORS.
CAN YOU GUYS ALL STAND UP?
I WANT TO JUST GIVE THEM
A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE,
'CAUSE THEY'RE DOING
REALLY IMPORTANT WORK.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ESTABLISHED
A PAGE PROGRAM IN 2014.
THE GOAL IS TO UTILIZE
OUR NETWORK, SKILLS,
AND RESOURCES
TO INFLUENCE
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
EVERYBODY.
I WOULD'VE NEVER THOUGHT
THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS POSSIBLE
WHEN I WAS JUST A KID
WITH A DREAM.
NOW I'M ACTUALLY WORKING
WITH THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
I AM AMAZED AND HONORED.
Contreras-Sweet: THESE
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE FUTURE
OF OUR GLOBAL ECONOMY,
AND, TODAY, WE'LL HEAR
ABOUT THE BUSINESSES
THEY'RE BUILDING.
FREEping ALLOWS ANYONE
IN THE WORLD WITH A MOBILE PHONE
TO ACCESS INFORMATION FOR FREE.
Man: FGC PLASMA SOLUTIONS
USES PLASMA
TO MAKE FLYING SAFER
AND MORE EFFICIENT.
WE WORK TO CONNECT WOMEN
IN RURAL COMMUNITIES
TO THE LIFE-SAVING SUPPLIES
THEY NEED AT CHILDBIRTH.
I'VE LEARNED
BY INVESTING IN SO MANY
DIFFERENT YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS
ON "SHARK TANK."
THE REALLY GOOD ONES ARE ALWAYS
GOOD WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN.
IDEAS ARE EASY.
WHAT'S HARD IS DOING THE WORK.
THESE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS
HAVE THE CREATIVITY,
THE IMAGINATION
TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
THE FUTURE SUCCESS
OF THE WORLD ECONOMY
RESTS ON THEIR SHOULDERS.
WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN
TO SUPPORT THEM.
GIVE IT UP
FOR THIS INCREDIBLE PANEL.
[ APPLAUSE ]
TELL HIM I SAID HELLO.
John: VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS
FULLY BEHIND THIS INITIATIVE.
HE HAS A PASSION, AS WELL,
FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP,
AND IT'S REALLY A PLEASURE
TO MEET HIM AND WORK WITH HIM.
FIRST OF ALL, THANKS
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
AND I JUST CAME BY
TO SAY KEEP IT UP.
"SHARK TANK" HAS BECOME
AN AMERICAN PHENOMENON.
AND US BEING HERE,
THE SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS
ALIVE AND WELL.
AND I THINK "SHARK TANK"
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THAT.
IF YOU CLIP IT,
YOU'RE ELIMINATED.
IF YOU'RE THE LAST MAN STANDING,
YOU WIN.
I'VE BEEN COMPETING SINCE 2013,
AND SINCE THEN,
I'VE WON ONE GOLD MEDAL
AND TWO SILVER MEDALS.
I DECIDED TO START A BUSINESS
'CAUSE I'M ALWAYS WORKING
ON MY BIKES,
GETTING DIRTY AND WHATNOT,
AND IT WAS REALLY A PRODUCT
THAT I NEEDED.
I TAUGHT MYSELF
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
FROM THE FORMULATION
TO PACKAGING.
I'VE DONE IT ALL RIGHT HERE
IN MY GARAGE.
I'M ONLY 25 YEARS OLD
AND I'VE SUSTAINED
A LOT OF HEAVY INJURIES,
AND I KNOW
I CAN'T DO THIS FOREVER,
SO I SEE THIS COMPANY
AS MY FUTURE.
I REALLY HOPE MY PRODUCT GOES
IN THERE,
GETS THEM INTERESTED,
AND GETS THEM ALL REVVED UP.
[ ENGINE REVVING ]
-WHOA.
-WOW.
Greiner: HOLY MOLY.
[ ENGINE STOPS ]
-PHEW, PHEW.
-VERY COOL.
Y-YOU'VE GOT THE DESIRE,
YOU'VE GOT THE EFFORT,
BUT YOU -- YOU DON'T HAVE
THE REST OF IT, RIGHT?
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE IT A BUSINESS YET,
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT.
YEAH.
I --
YEAH, IT'S A BUMMER
'CAUSE I KNEW COMING INTO THIS,
I WAS AT A BIG DISADVANTAGE
BEING A PREMATURE COMPANY,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO HIDE THE FACT,
DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE IT
ALL GLITZ AND GLAMOUR --
THAT I'M SOMETHING BIGGER
THAN I'M NOT.
I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA BE
TOO MUCH WORK
FROM OUR POST RELATIVE
TO THE UPSIDE,
SO UNFORTUNATELY,
FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.
I, UH --
I LIKE THE IDEA.
I THINK THIS IS ONLINE,
AND I THINK THAT YOU SAID
YOU CAN GET THE BOTTLES DOWN
TO A DOLLAR WITH 20,000 UNITS.
YES, SIR.
I THINK YOU NEED
JUST $20,000 THEN FOR --
AND THAT YOU
CAN RAISE $20,000
AND YOU CAN PUT THESE THINGS
ONLINE WITH YOUR GANG.
YOU KNOW, SET UP SMALL BOOTHS
AT THE SHOWS,
AND I THINK THAT YOU COULD PUT
A LOT OF MONEY IN YOUR POCKET
WITHOUT THE PROBLEM
OF HAVING AN INVESTOR.
RIGHT.
I CAN'T BE OF ANY SERVICE
TO YOU, AND I THINK YOU COULD BE
OF MORE SERVICE TO YOURSELF,
SO I'M OUT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
KEVIN, I'D LOVE TO HEAR
YOUR ADVICE ON THIS PRODUCT.
YEAH, LOOK, I'M --
I'M IN THE CAMP THAT SAYS
YOU'RE VERY CREDIBLE
AND YOU BUILT IT OUT OF A NEED
THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF, WHICH IS
WHERE GREAT PRODUCTS COME FROM.
HAVE YOU DONE ANY WORK
IN FIGURING OUT
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA
MANUFACTURE IT,
WHO'S GONNA ACTUALLY FORMULATE
IT FOR YOU IN LARGE VOLUMES?
I STILL WANT TO DO
IT MYSELF, AND THAT'S
WHAT THE INVESTMENT IS FOR.
'CAUSE, LIKE I SAID, I'M DOING
IT IN A BUCKET RIGHT NOW,
AND IT'S NOT PRACTICAL, SO --
WHEN YOU SAY DO IT YOURSELF,
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU WANT TO KEEP
MANUFACTURING IT YOURSELF?
I WOULD LIKE
TO KEEP DOING IT MYSELF,
BUT I AM NOT AGAINST
SOMEBODY ELSE DOING IT.
-IN YOUR HOUSE?
-YOU HAVE TO.
AT POLAR PRO, WE DESIGN

BATTERIES OR USB DEVICES

[ Surfer voice ]

ARE THESE UNITS
CURRENTLY OUT ON THE MARKET?
YES, SO, WE HAVE 31 SKUs
LIVE ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.
WE DESIGN, WE MANUFACTURE,
WE ASSEMBLE,
WE MARKET, WE DO EVERYTHING.
WHAT'S YOUR
BIGGEST-SELLING ITEM?
RIGHT NOW, OUR CAMERA FILTERS
FOR THE DRONES
HAVE BEEN OUTSELLING --
REALLY?
THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING?
Cuban: YEAH, 'CAUSE NOBODY ELSE
REALLY OUT THERE
WITH ADD-ONS
FOR DRONES YET.
-EXACTLY.
-WHAT DOES THAT SELL FOR?
THE THREE PACK IS $69.99.
WE ALSO HAVE A SIX PACK
THAT IS $149.99.
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE THAT LANDED?
LANDED, IT'S $12.
OUR MARGINS RIGHT NOW
IS 75% TO 300%.
WOW!
John: I DO KNOW
THAT DRONES ARE BIG.
WHAT DOES THE FILTER DO?
SO, WE'VE GOT
A POLARIZER FILTER
AS WELL
AS NEUTRAL DENSITY FILTERS.
SO, WE'VE GOT A PRETTY SICK
COMPARISON VIDEO UP HERE.
I'M DYING
TO SEE YOUR JAM, BRO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S LITERALLY TOOLING
AND PRODUCT DESIGN.
BECAUSE ACCESSORIES
ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING.
SO, I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AND WHAT'S OCCURRING
IN LET'S SAY
THE ACCESSORIES MARKET
AROUND SMARTPHONES.
-RIGHT.
-APPLE, ANDROID.
AND SO THE GUYS THAT ARE WINNING
THAT HAVE HUGE SCALE.
THEY HAVE A CONSTANT FLOW
OF NEW OFFERINGS GOING
TO RETAIL STORES.
AND OVER TIME,
THEIR MARGINS HAVE DECREASED
BECAUSE THERE'S TONS
OF COMPETITION.
I THINK THE SAME THING'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH RUNNING WITH THE WOLVES.
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
BUT YOU GOT TO GET
A LOT BIGGER A LOT FASTER.
EXACTLY, AND THAT'S WHY
I'M HERE TODAY
SO WE CAN RAMP EVERYTHING UP.
YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW --
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
IS A TOUGH SPACE BECAUSE MARGINS
ALWAYS GET CRUSHED.
I'M LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY.
NOTHING PROPRIETARY.
NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE EIGHT PATENTS
COVERING OUR MOST POPULAR ITEM.
WHAT ARE THOSE?
DOESN'T MEAN POO-POO
IN THIS SPACE
'CAUSE YOU CAN
INNOVATE AROUND IT
AND GET THE NEXT ONE
OUT THE DOOR.
THAT --
THAT'S MY OPINION.
I'M JUST A SHARK TRYING
TO MAKE A BUCK.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, KEVIN.
HOW BIG DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD BE?
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO GET TO?
RIGHT, SO, WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TALK TO THE BIG-BOX STORES.
SO WE'RE IN 1,200 LOCATIONS
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S ALL INDEPENDENT SURF SHOPS,
SMALLER-TIME GUYS.
REALLY?
HOW BIG DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN BE WITH THE DRONE MARKET?
THAT BLEW OUR MINDS.
WITH HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE BUYING DRONES NOW
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE BUYING OUR FILTERS,
WE'RE THE BIGGEST THIRD-PARTY
AFTERMARKET DRONE COMPANY
RIGHT NOW.
WHERE DO YOU SEE IT TWO,
THREE YEARS FROM NOW?
TWO, THREE YEARS,
IF WE GET BEST BUY AND HIT
AT, LIKE, R.E.I.,
SPORTS AUTHORITY...
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
...WE CAN EASILY BE
AT $40 MILLION, $50 MILLION.
I SEE THE BIG OPPORTUNITY
IS THE DRONE MARKET.
LIKE YOU SAID,
YOUR PEDAL'S TO THE METAL.
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE, RIGHT?
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
THE RIGHT OFFER,
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO WASTE A LOT OF TIME
GOING BACK AND FORTH
WITH THESE OTHER SHARKS.
SO, HERE'S MY OFFER.
