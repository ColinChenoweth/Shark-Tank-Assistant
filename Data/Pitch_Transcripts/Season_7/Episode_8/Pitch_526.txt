MY NAME IS JEFF OVERALL
FROM NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA.
SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR
AND FOUNDER OF POLAR PRO.
TODAY I AM SEEKING
A $500,000 INVESTMENT
FOR 10% OF MY COMPANY.
-OH.
-YO, DUDE!
Herjavec: DUDE.
-31 SKUs?
-JEFF, DO YOU MAKE THEM?
Herjavec: ARE YOU
MANUFACTURING THESE?
JEFF, WHAT ARE
YOUR TOTAL SALES?
IN 2011, THE FIRST YEAR
WE WERE IN BUSINESS,
WE DID $8,000.
-GNARLY, DUDE.
-YEE-HAW!
[ LAUGHS ]
LAST YEAR, WE DID $2.8 MILLION.
-WOW.
AND THIS YEAR, WE'RE ON TRACK
TO DO ABOUT $5.6 MILLION.
-WOW.
-YEAH!
-VERY IMPRESSIVE.
-NOW -- NOW THAT'S AMAZING.
THOSE ARE HUGE NUMBERS.
TELL US WHY
YOU RAMPED UP LIKE THAT.
WHAT WE DO WITH THOSE PROFITS
IS WE RE-INVEST IN R&amp;D
AND MAKING OTHER ACCESSORIES
THAT OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T DOING.
I MEAN, WE'RE YOUNG,
WE'RE INNOVATIVE.
BY THE TIME SOMEBODY COMES IN
AND COPIES ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS,
WE'VE TAKEN PROFITS
AND MADE THREE OTHER ONES
AND KEEP IT GOING.
YOU'RE ALWAYS AHEAD
OF THE TREND.
-EXACTLY.
-AND, JEFF, ARE YOU A DESIGNER?
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
SO, I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR
AT HEART.
WHEN I WAS 15 YEARS OLD,
I STARTED MY FIRST COMPANY --
WE GOT CRABS.
I WAS IN A FISH STORE AND I SAW
THAT THEY WERE SELLING
HERMIT CRABS FOR $4 EACH.
AND I WAS LIKE, "THESE CRABS
ARE DOWN AT THE BEACH.
LIKE,
THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THEM."
SO I WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH
WITH MY BUCKET,
THREW -- THREW A BUNCH OF CRABS
IN THE BUCKET,
AND STARTED SELLING
THEM ONLINE.
BUT WHEN WAS THAT?
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT?
NO, WHEN?
THAT WAS 15, SO I'M 26 NOW.
SO, IT WAS ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO.
-OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
SO, HOW DID YOU
START THIS BUSINESS?
YEAH, SO THIS BUSINESS
WAS STARTED
WHEN I WAS
AT U.C. SANTA BARBARA.
I WAS ON THE SKI TEAM,
AND WE WERE FILMING A TON
ON THE SNOW WITH THESE CAMERAS,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHY DON'T MY VIDEOS LOOK
LIKE ALL THESE
PRODUCTION SKI MOVIES?"
SO I WENT ONLINE,
DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH,
AND SAW THAT
ALL THESE GUYS' PRODUCTION
ARE USING POLARIZER FILTERS.
SO I WAS LIKE,
"OH, THAT'S COOL."
SO I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
I'LL JUST BUY A DSLR1."
BOUGHT IT, DUCT TAPED IT
ONTO THE CAMERA,
WENT OUT THERE, AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD!"
LIKE, THIS MAKES
A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
AND WAS LIKE, "HEY, I BET PEOPLE
WOULD PAY FOR THESE."
-WOW.
-SO I WENT HOME,
LEARNED HOW TO BUILD
THE WEBSITE, BUILT IT,
LEARNED HOW TO DO SOME S.E.O.,
OPTIMIZED IT, AND...
-AND HERE YOU ARE. BOOM.
-...STARTED POLAR PRO.
HOW MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY'S
IN HERE, OR ARE THERE INVESTORS?
I USED $2,000
OF MY STUDENT LOAN MONEY, SO...
GOT IT.
...INSTEAD OF BUYING
TEXTBOOKS AND FOOD,
PRETTY MUCH, I USED IT
TO START THE COMPANY.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL.
GOOD FOR YOU.
DO YOU HAVE DEBT?
NO,
WE DON'T HAVE ANY DEBT.
WHAT'S THE PROFIT
ON THE $5.6 MILLION?
SO, PROFIT THIS YEAR
WILL PROBABLY END UP
AT ABOUT $300,000.
-OH.
-BUT YOU GOT TO KEEP IN MIND
I'M NOT TRYING TO SKIM
PROFIT OFF THE TABLE.
I'M REINVESTING IN R&amp;D RIGHT NOW
TRYING TO TAKE THIS THING
AS BIG AS POSSIBLE.
WAIT, WAIT, OKAY.
BUT JEFF, WHERE DOES --
IT DOESN'T ADD UP.
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT
ALL THIS MARGIN.
YOU SHOULD BE MAKING
A MILLION DOLLARS PLUS.
-HE HAS A LOT OF PRODUCT.
-RIGHT.
-HOW MUCH DO YOU SPEND ON R&amp;D?
-OVER A MILLION DOLLARS.
-WOW.
-OH, WOW.
-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
-WOW.
IN JEFF'S CAMERA ACCESSORY
COMPANY POLAR PRO.
Cuban: I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
THE RIGHT OFFER,
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO WASTE A LOT OF TIME
GOING BACK AND FORTH
WITH THESE OTHER SHARKS.
SO, HERE'S MY OFFER.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE 500K
AND DO 10%
IF YOU'RE READY
TO SAY GO.
WOW, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HE'S LOOKING FOR.
NOW...

TEACHERS AT U.C.S.B.
SAID NEVER DO A DEAL THAT YOU
DON'T HEAR OUT EVERYBODY ELSE,
-SO --

AND YOU'RE THINKING
SHARKS ARE HUNGRY.
John:
