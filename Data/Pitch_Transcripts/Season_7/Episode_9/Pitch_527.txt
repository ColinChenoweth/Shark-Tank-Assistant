DAYMOND JOHN DOMINATED
THE FASHION WORLD WITH FUBU.
NOW HE'S THE BRANDING EXPERT
BEHIND MULTIPLE GLOBAL BRANDS
GENERATING BILLIONS IN SALES.
ROBERT HERJAVEC, SON OF
AN IMMIGRANT FACTORY WORKER,
FOUNDED ONE OF
THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT
CYBER-SECURITY FIRMS.
LORI GREINER, THE QUEEN OF QVC,
HOLDS OVER 100 PATENTS

MORE THAN 400 PRODUCTS,
GROSSING OVER A HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS IN SALES.
AND MARK CUBAN,
ESTEEMED BILLIONAIRE TECH MOGUL
AND THE OUTSPOKEN OWNER
OF THE DALLAS MAVERICKS.
FIRST INTO THE TANK
IS AN ENTREPRENEUR
WITH AN IMAGINATIVE NEW
RECREATIONAL SPORT.
Radosta: HEY, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JOHN ANTHONY RADOSTA,
AND I'M
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
AT ADVANCED SPORTS TECHNOLOGY.
I'M HERE SEEKING $160,000
FOR A 10% EQUITY STAKE
IN MY CORPORATION.
SHARKS,
ADVANCED SPORTS TECHNOLOGY
IS AT THE FOREFRONT
OF A NEW SPORT
THAT'S SWEEPING THE ENTIRE
NATION LIKE A TIDAL WAVE.
SHARKS, THIS IS THE NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF BUBBLE SOCCER.
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE GOT TO TRY THIS.
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
UGH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-OH!
-THEY CAN REALLY PLAY, TOO.
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
[ APPLAUSE ]
SHARKS, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF BUBBLE SOCCER
ADDS THE ONE THING MISSING
FROM TRADITIONAL SOCCER --
FULL CONTACT.
-YOU CAN GET PHYSICAL.
-[ LAUGHS ]
-DELIVER SOME BIG HITS.
-OH, MY GOD.
AND FALL DOWN LAUGHING
LIKE YOU NEVER HAVE BEFORE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO, SHARKS, WHO'S READY TO
GET THE BALL ROLLING
AND CARVE THEIR NAME
INTO SPORTS HISTORY?
-CAN WE TRY IT?
-YEAH, CAN WE TRY?
-YES, ABSOLUTELY.
-I WOULD LOVE TO.
-COME DOWN.
-I WANT TO TRY.
COME ON OUT, ALL.
I'M KNOCKING YOU.
YOU GUYS ARE TOAST.
YOU'RE GONNA LOOP YOUR HANDS
THROUGH THESE FIRST.
-OH, I GOT IT.
-AND YOU'RE IN.
SHARKS IN THE BUBBLE.
CUBAN,
PUT THE BALL DOWN.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
UGH! OH!
[ LAUGHTER ]
BOOM!
WHOO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]
THAT WAS THE BEST.
THAT WAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST.
SO, JOHN, YOU'RE GONNA WALK US
THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS MODEL?
YEAH, SO ESSENTIALLY,
WE'RE THE ONE-STOP SHOP
FOR THE PERSPECTIVE BUBBLE
SOCCER ENTREPRENEUR
TO GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED
TO BE A PART OF THIS SPORT
AND PART OF
A SUPPORTIVE ORGANIZATION.
WE JUST LAUNCHED
OUR 40th AFFILIATE
THROUGHOUT
THE UNITED STATES.
SO ESSENTIALLY,
THEY RUN LEAGUES FOR US,
AND ESSENTIALLY,
WE WORK WITH THEM
AS AN EXCLUSIVE
EQUIPMENT PROVIDER
AND LEAD GENERATION PARTNER,
AND THEY'RE ACTIVELY
IN EACH CITY RUNNING LEAGUES.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
BEFORE YOU GET TECHNICAL,
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T --
DID YOU PLAY?
NO, I WATCHED YOU IDIOTS
BOUNCE OFF EACH OTHER.
-IT WAS FUN. IT WAS FUN.
-IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE
THAT MUCH FUN.
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT.
IT REALLY IS.
Cuban:
THE BUBBLES WERE FUN,
BUT NO ONE CARED ABOUT
THE ACTUAL SOCCER, THE SPORT.
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT.
SO THERE'S TWO TYPES
OF DEMOGRAPHICS
THAT PLAY BUBBLE SOCCER.
THERE'S
THE PRIVATE EVENT SIDE,
WHICH IS BASICALLY PEOPLE
JUST WANT TO GET IN THE BUBBLES,
TRY IT ONCE, CRASH INTO
EACH OTHER, HAVE SOME FUN.
THEN THERE'S ALSO
THE LEAGUE SIDE.
THERE'S THE LEAGUE COMPETITOR.
THEY'RE ACTIVE.
THEY'RE COMING BACK EVERY WEEK,
AND THEY'RE PLAYING IN GAMES.
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE PLAYING IT TODAY?
WE'RE ALIVE
IN ABOUT 39 CITIES.
DEPENDING ON THE LEAGUE,
IT'S ANYWHERE BETWEEN
8 TO 12 TEAMS.
SO IF SOME OF IT IS EVENT
AND SOME OF IT IS THE LEAGUES,
HOW MUCH OF IT IS
FOR PRIVATE EVENTS, PARTIES,
THINGS LIKE THAT?
IT'S ABOUT
A 50/50 SPLIT.
BUT JOHN, FROM
A PROMOTIONAL PERSPECTIVE,
WE'VE RENTED STUFF
THAT'S SIMILAR.
WE DIDN'T INVENT THE SPORT
BY ANY MEANS.
WE SAW -- THE WAY
THAT I ACTUALLY GOT INTO THIS
IS I HAD SEEN SOME VIRAL VIDEOS
OVER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
AND IN AUSTRALIA --
ARE THESE LEAGUES
EXISTING THERE?
YEAH.
HOW BIG HAS THIS GONE
IN EUROPE?
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS ACTUALLY
THOSE LEAGUES ARE THRIVING
MORE THAN EVER.
DEFINE THRIVING.
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE,
I DON'T HAVE THE SEARCH VOLUME
FOR EUROPE OFF-HAND,
BUT JUST THE UNITED STATES,
IN 2014,
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SEARCHES
PER MONTH IN GOOGLE
WAS ABOUT 55,000 SEARCHES.
IN 2015, IT GOT UP TO
85,000 SEARCHES.
BUT JOHN --
BUT DON'T TELL ME THE SEARCHES.
TELL ME THE SALES
IN EUROPE.
IT'S PRIVATE COMPANIES.
I DON'T HAVE DATA.
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW MANY LEAGUES THERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE SALES IN EUROPE,
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW MANY TEAMS THERE ARE.
JUST IN ONE YEAR,
NOW WE'RE SEEING LEAGUES
POP UP IN
HONG KONG, TAIWAN --
NO, FORGET THE LEAGUES,
FORGET THE LEAGUES, JOHN.
-HOW MANY TEAMS ARE THERE?
-HOW MANY TEAMS ARE THERE?
HOW MANY TEAMS --
IT VARIES DEPENDING UPON
THE PARTICULAR SEASON, SO --
WHY CAN'T I GET
A STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM YOU?
O'Leary: I DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS IN AUSTRALIA.
I'M INVESTING IN
THE UNITED STATES RIGHT HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET
IN REVENUE THIS YEAR,
NEXT YEAR,
THE YEAR AFTER THAT?
HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE EACH YEAR?
SO WE'VE BEEN IN THE MARKET
FOR ABOUT 13 MONTHS.
THUS FAR, IN TOTAL SALES,
WE'VE DONE $355,867 IN SALES.
AND WHERE'S THAT REVENUE
COMING FROM?
YEAR ONE WAS EXCLUSIVELY
EQUIPMENT SALES,
HOWEVER, WE ALSO HAVE
A LEAD GENERATION
AND REFERRAL SYSTEM
THAT FUNCTIONS,
BASICALLY,
ON A COST-PER-LEAD BASIS.
WE'RE ON TRACK.
WE'VE STEADILY BEEN INCREASING
REVENUES, 38%, MONTH OVER MONTH.
GIVE ME THE DOLLAR.
WHAT'S THIS YEAR?
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT
IS $430,000...
THIS YEAR.
...THAT WE'RE PROJECTED
TO DO THIS YEAR.
HOW MUCH
YOU GONNA MAKE ON IT?
FREE CASH FLOW MARGIN'S 23%.
YOU'RE TELLING ME
$430,000,
YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE $80,000 ON IT, RIGHT?
FREE CASH FLOW, YES.
-WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEAR?
-THE YEAR AFTER THAT,
WE'RE EXPECTING ANYWHERE BETWEEN
$683,000 AND $742,000 --
SEE, BUT NOW YOU'RE JUST --
OKAY, OKAY.
-SO LET'S -- LET'S BE CLEAR.
-BUT YOU --
KNOWING YOUR NUMBERS
IS ONE THING,
BUT KNOWING YOU'RE JUST
PICKING NUMBERS OUT OF THE AIR,
JUST THROWING THEM OUT
IS --
YOU ASKED HIM THE FUTURE,
THOUGH. HE HAD --
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THE EVALUATION
THAT I PRESENTED HERE TODAY
IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED
FREE CASH FLOW MODEL
WITH A DIMINISHING GROWTH RATE
OVER 60 MONTHS.
YOU'VE GOT TWO GUYS IN A BALL
BOUNCING AGAINST EACH OTHER,
AND YOU'RE DOING
DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW?
ABSOLUTELY.
JOHN, WHERE DO YOU SEE IT GOING?
DO YOU MANUFACTURE THE BUBBLES?
YES, WE MANUFACTURE
THE EQUIPMENT.
TELL US WHAT THE BALLS COST,
JOHN.
SO TOTAL-ENDED COST FOR US
IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN
$150 TO $160 PER BALL.
-WOW.
-WOW.
-OH, REALLY? WOW.
-WHAT DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?
TO THE END CUSTOMER, WE SELL
THEM IN FOUR DIFFERENT PACKAGES,
RANGING ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT
$4,000 TO ABOUT $16,000.
OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
A LEAGUE, RIGHT?
IT'S AN INVESTMENT
IN A BUSINESS.
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THE BALLS
INDIVIDUALLY.
-NO.
-YOU SELL THEM AS A PACKAGE.
THIS IS SOMEONE INVESTING IN
A BUSINESS.
SO, JOHN,
I PAID YOU THE $4,000.
HOW MUCH MORE MONEY DO YOU MAKE
FROM ME OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS?
WE WORK WITH OUR AFFILIATES
IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.
WE OFFER OPTIONAL
EQUIPMENT PROTECTION PLANS.
YOU'RE PAYING ANYWHERE FROM
$90 A MONTH TO ABOUT $120
'CAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE
A COST-PER-LEAD,
SO IF WE SEND YOU FOUR LEADS,
IT'S $8 PER LEAD
THAT WE SEND YOU.
SO THE ONGOING REVENUE
IS FROM LEAD GENERATION.
IT'S FROM LEAD GENERATION
AND EXTENDED WARRANTY PROGRAM.
I FIND THIS
VERY CONFUSING.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON.
YOU HAVE LEAGUES AND THEN
YOU HAVE EVENTS AND PARTIES.
SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO
CATER TO THE MARKET
IN HOWEVER THEY WANT
TO EXPERIENCE THIS SPORT.
WHEN YOU DO IT
FOR THE PARTIES AND EVENTS,
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE PEOPLE
TO USE THEM FOR THE DAY?
A TYPICAL BIRTHDAY PARTY
WILL BRING IN ANYWHERE BETWEEN
$300 TO $500.
SORRY, JOHN.
DO YOU DO THIS DIRECT
OR DO THE LOCAL FRANCHISEES
DO THOSE?
THE LOCAL FRANCHISEES --
SO THEY ARE --
SO YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY
ON THE CORPORATE EVENTS?
NO.
-I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
-SEE, THAT'S THE KEY.
THE BULK OF JOHN'S SALES
ARE ONE-TIME.
JOHN,
I DID NOT REALIZE THAT.
HE DOESN'T CARE
WHAT THEY USE THEM FOR --
CORPORATE OR WHETHER
THEY'RE PLAYING A GAME.
IT ALWAYS BOTHERS ME
WHEN AN ENTREPRENEUR
COMES INTO THE SHARK TANK
AND IMMEDIATELY,
THE SHARKS TRY TO REDEFINE
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL.
THAT MEANS IT'S NOT CLEAR.
IT DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH OF A DEFINITION
IN TERMS OF PLACING CASH
BACK TO ME AS AN INVESTOR.
AND YOU WERE ALL OVER THE MAP,
YOU KNOW?
I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU EVER MAKE ANY MONEY.
YOU DID A REALLY POOR JOB
EXPLAINING IT TO ME.
SORRY. I'M OUT.
SURE.
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THIS IS
GREAT FOR THE CONSUMER.
I DON'T SEE THE VISION
FOR THE LEAGUES, SO I'M OUT.
JOHN, THE LONGER YOU TALKED,
THE MORE CONFUSING IT GOT.
THE LONGER YOU TALKED, THE MORE
BUSINESS MODELS THERE WERE.
IT FELL APART FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE TO HEAR,
BECAUSE ON THE TECH SIDE,
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A HUGE
TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT WE ACTIVELY
NEED SOME HELP MANAGING.
SEE, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
NOW IT'S A TECH BUSINESS.
PICK ONE BUSINESS
AND GROW THAT PART.
WHY?
THEY ALL MAKE MONEY.
John: YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING
TO EVERYBODY.
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU
BECAUSE YOU'VE SCALED
PRETTY QUICKLY IN 13 MONTHS.
MY CHALLENGE IS
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA SCALE
MUCH LARGER THAN IT IS NOW.
YOU'VE DONE WELL WITH IT
TO THIS POINT,
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HIT
A BRICK WALL.
I'M OUT.
I DON'T SEE ANY BRICK WALLS,
BUT UNDERSTANDABLE.
MARK, IF THERE'S ANYBODY WHO CAN
HELP WITH SPORTS AND TECH,
I MEAN,
THAT'S OUR FOCUS HERE.
HERE'S WHAT I SEE.
YOU'RE NOT IN
THE SOCCER BUSINESS.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE PRODUCTS.
YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY BUSINESS, RIGHT?
WHAT'S KEY
IS YOUR AFFILIATES.
IF YOU WOULD HAVE COME IN HERE
AND SAID, YOU KNOW,
"WE HAVE AFFILIATES
IN 39 CITIES
AND THEY ALL
MAKE $25,000 A YEAR,
AND WE'RE GONNA
HELP THOSE AFFILIATES GROW
TO MAKE
$100,000 A YEAR EACH,
AND THAT'S GONNA BE
THE FOUNDATION
OF GROWING THIS LEAGUE,"
THAT WOULD HAVE TOLD US
WHAT BUSINESS YOU'RE IN,
BUT YOU WERE SO CONVOLUTED
IN TRYING TO SHOW US THE NUMBERS
AND HOW WELL
YOU UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS,
YOU MISSED THE BASIC POINT
OF WHAT YOUR BUSINESS WAS.
IT WAS HARD TO UNDERSTAND.
I'M OUT.
WOW.
THAT'S SURPRISING.
-OKAY.
-NOT REALLY.
-REALLY?
-NOT REALLY.
YOU GOT FIVE PEOPLE
THAT AREN'T CLEAR ABOUT IT.
THANK YOU, GUYS, VERY MUCH.
CAN'T SELL THEM ALL.
VERY, VERY SMART SHARKS,
VERY SMART BUSINESSMEN,
BUT THEY DID
MAKE A MISTAKE TODAY,
AND WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.
IT'S FINE.
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK
ARE ENTREPRENEURS HOPING TO MAKE
A TRADITIONAL BRAZILIAN STAPLE
INTO A POPULAR AMERICAN SNACK.
John: I'M TRYING TO SEE
WHERE I ADD VALUE.
YOU'RE ALREADY DOING AMAZING,
AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO GROW
IN THE WHOLE FOODS OF THE WORLD.
BUT I BELIEVE THAT ONLINE,
YOU CAN GET FULL MARGIN.
-BUT I UNDERSTAND --
-SHIP IT FROZEN?
-YES, SHIP IT.
-HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
LET ME TALK FIRST.
BAD IDEA.
HERE'S WHERE
I BELIEVE I CAN HELP.
AL "BUBBA" BAKER.
I JUST DID A DEAL WITH HIM --
BUBBA'S BONELESS RIBS.
WE GOT TO REALLY MESS UP
TO NOT DO $200 MILLION.
HE'S DOING $25,000 A MINUTE
ON QVC.
HE'S WITH A GROUP CALLED
RASTELLI FRESH FOOD MARKET,
AND THEY SHIP GOODS,
LIKE OMAHA STEAKS.
MM-HMM.
THIS COMPLEMENTS
THE STEAK AND THE SEAFOOD
THAT ALL HAS TO BE SHIPPED
VERY TIME SENSITIVE,
FROZEN, NEXT DAY,
AND THEY ALREADY HAVE
A WIDE CUSTOMER BASE.
AND THERE,
YOU GET MORE MONEY
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING
DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER.
-SURE.
-MM-HMM.
BUT WHAT'S IT WORTH MY TIME?
I WOULD HAVE TO ASK FOR...
25% FOR $200,000.
IS THAT AN OFFER?
MATTER OF FACT,
THAT IS AN OFFER.
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER, WE'D
LIKE TO HEAR IF THERE ARE ANY --
I WOULD DO THE DEAL
200K FOR 20%.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Greiner: I'M SITTING HERE
THINKING ABOUT IT,
BECAUSE I DID A DEAL
LAST YEAR
WITH THE BANTAM BAGELS
STUFFED BAGEL BALLS, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS,
IT LOOKS VERY SIMILAR.
I'M WONDERING
HOW THIS COULD INTEGRATE
WITH MY STUFFED BAGEL BALLS
OR IF IT'S COMPETITIVE.
STOP AND THINK
FOR A MINUTE,
AND TELL ME
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MY BANTAM BAGELS
STUFFED BAGEL BALLS AND YOU.
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT
OUR PRODUCT IS GLUTEN-FREE.
YOU GOT IT.
THEIR'S IS A TRADITIONAL BAGEL
MADE WITH WHEAT.
-GOOD ANSWER.
-YES.
-RIGHT ANSWER.
-I WAS NERVOUS FOR YOU.
I'M GONNA OFFER $200,000 FOR
THE SAME 25% DAYMOND SAID.
OOH.
NICE STORY.
TOUGH OFFER.
TOUGH OFFER.
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.
I'LL DROP MY ASK TO
15% FOR THE 200K,
JUST TO
MAKE IT INTERESTING.
YOU'VE GOT KEVIN
GOING THE RIGHT WAY.
AND TO PUT SOME PRESSURE
ON THESE OTHER SHARKS.
GUYS, YOU'VE GOT A FEEDING
FRENZY FOR YOUR BRAZILIAN BITES.
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN,
John:
DO YOU HAVE DEBT ON THE COMPANY?
WE ACTUALLY HAD TO TAKE ON DEBT
IN ORDER TO BUILD OUT
OUR PRODUCTION FACILITY.
AND HOW MUCH DEBT
DO YOU HAVE NOW?
SO OUR DEBT ON THE BOOKS
IS ABOUT $200,000,
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY
IN THE PROCESS
OF TRANSITIONING
OUT OF PRODUCTION.
AND WHEN WE DO THAT, WE'RE GONNA
SELL A LOT OF OUR EQUIPMENT,
SO WE'RE GONNA RECOUP
A LOT OF THAT.
WHY ARE YOU TRANSITIONING
OUT OF THAT?
DO YOU FIND A GREAT CO-PACK
OR A PARTNER?
YEAH, WE ACTUALLY HAVE
A CO-PACKING PARTNER
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE
WORKING WITH, AND --
AND IS THAT PERSON GONNA OWN
ANY OF THE COMPANY, AS WELL?
THEY'VE MADE AN INVESTMENT
IN THE COMPANY.
HOW MUCH IS THAT?
WE HAVE A 50-50 PARTNERSHIP
WITH THEM.
-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
-SO YOU --
Cuban: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
YEAH, YOU GUYS OWN
50% OF THE COMPANY.
-CORRECT.
-YES.
John: BUT GUYS, THEY'RE NOT
BEING CREATIVE AT ALL.
THEY'RE NOT GROWING THE COMPANY
WITH THE STRATEGY.
WOULD YOU RATHER GO 12%
WITH KEVIN?
LORI, WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
GUYS, THEY'RE NOT GROWING
THE COMPANY WITH THE STRATEGY.
-LORI.
-I WOULD GO TO 20%.
-THAT'S BRUTAL.
-AND I DON'T --
THE PROBLEM IS IS I DON'T
WANT TO SQUEEZE YOU HERE.
YEAH.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU GAVE AWAY
50% OF YOUR COMPANY,
WHICH MIGHT BE A GOOD MOVE
TO A CO-PACKER.
IT WAS A GREAT DECISION, YEAH.
John:
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
THANK YOU.
John:
DOES THE CHILD OR THE PARENTS --
DO THEY GET A ROYALTY?
John: HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
I HAVE MAYBE ONE BRAND
IN BLOOMINGDALE'S,
AND I HAD TO BEG
TO GET THERE.
WE DID A LOT OF BEGGING.
SO I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU
ON THAT.
I WOULD HAVE TO OFFER
THE 150K FOR 33.3%.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR OFFER.
-YOU NOW HAVE TWO OFFERS.
-AND HERE'S WHY I WANT THE 1/3.
IT'S GONNA BE
ALL THREE OF US WORKING AT IT.
I JUST KNOW
I BRING A DIFFERENT SKILL SET.
AND THOSE ARE TWO AMAZING OFFERS
AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
DAYMOND JOHN,
WHO'S THE FASHION GURU,
WANTS TO BE
AN EQUAL PARTNER.
HE'S OFFERED YOU $150,000
FOR 33.3%.
MARK AND LORI, WHO DON'T HAVE
THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FASHION,
ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU THE SAME
AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR ONLY 20%.
THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE TIMES IN
"SHARK TANK" HISTORY
WHERE TWO SHARKS ARE ASKING FOR
LESS EQUITY THAN ONE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
IT'S LITTLE BROTHER'S CALL.
DAYMOND, WE REALLY THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OFFER.
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO
PROTECT SOME OF THAT EQUITY
SO THAT WE CAN RAISE MORE MONEY
IN THE FUTURE.
WE WOULD LOVE TO MAKE A DEAL
WITH MARK AND LORI.
-AW!
-SO WE HAVE A DEAL?
-WE HAVE A DEAL.
-DONE.
AWESOME.
-PLEASURE.
-I CAN'T WATCH TO SEE YOU.
-APPRECIATE IT.
-I WILL GET YOU HOOKED UP.
-OH, I LOVE IT!
-OH, MY GOD.
[ LAUGHS ]
O'Leary: EW.
[ LAUGHS ]
THANK YOU, GUYS.
I'M KEEPING THE SHIRT.
-YES, IT'S ALL YOURS.
-THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Greiner: CONGRATS.
John:
HERE'S WHERE I'M AT.
IT'S VERY HARD
FOR ME TO DO THIS DEAL
BECAUSE IF MY BOMBAS SOCKS GUYS
FOUND I WOULD DO THIS,
THEY WOULD BEAT ME SO HARD
THAT I'D BE
HOOKED ON PAINKILLERS
-FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
-CAN I STOP YOU RIGHT THERE?
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE WANT TO PURSUE
IS TO GET A LICENSING DEAL WITH
A SHOE OR A SOCK MANUFACTURER.
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE --
YOU HAVE A SOCK --
YES,
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
LOSING SOCKS IS WHERE WE MAKE,
YOU KNOW, OUR BUSINESS.
