HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JUNEA.
AND I'M CAMERON.
WE'RE THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON,
BEHIND BRAZI BITES.
WE'RE SEEKING
A $200,000 INVESTMENT
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
IN OUR AWESOME COMPANY.
SHARKS, BRAZIL IS KNOWN FOR
ITS BEAUTY AND EXOTIC CULTURE,
BUT IT ALSO HAS
AMAZING FOOD.
I GREW UP IN BRAZIL,
AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE FOODS
IS BRAZILIAN CHEESE BREAD.
IT IS CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE
AND FLUFFY INSIDE.
IT IS SO DELICIOUS,
YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS THAT
IT'S NATURALLY GLUTEN-FREE.
WHEN I MOVED TO THE U.S.,
I WAS SHOCKED.
I COULDN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.
THIS BREAD IS TOO GOOD
NOT TO SHARE,
SO WE TOOK
JUNEA'S SECRET FAMILY RECIPE
AND DEVELOPED A PRODUCT LINE
THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE
THE BEST-TASTING, HIGHEST
QUALITY BRAZILIAN CHEESE BREAD
AVAILABLE ANYWHERE.
TODAY, WE HAVE
FOUR DELICIOUS FLAVORS
THAT GO STRAIGHT FROM
THE FREEZER TO THE OVEN
AND ARE READY TO ENJOY
IN MINUTES.
OUR CUSTOMERS
CAN'T GET ENOUGH.
-SO WHO IS READY TO JOIN US?
-BRING IT ON. LET'S GO.
OUR MISSION TO BRING
SOUTH AMERICA FLAVORS.
-GO. WE'RE HUNGRY.
-LET'S TRY IT.
-I'M DYING TO TRY.
YOU GUYS READY FOR SOME SAMPLES?
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-DIFFERENT FLAVORS?
Cameron: DIFFERENT FLAVORS.
THERE'S FOUR FLAVORS THERE.
THEY'RE MARKED WITH TOOTHPICKS
FOR THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS.
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS SO GOOD.
THE BACON?
RIGHT?
MMM, GARLIC ASIAGO.
Junea: SO, THE FLOUR THAT MAKES
THE BREAD IS TAPIOCA FLOUR,
AND IT'S NATURALLY GLUTEN-FREE.
OH, MY GOD,
THE PEPPER JACK IS SO GOOD.
-OHH!
-THESE ARE REALLY, REALLY GOOD.
-AMAZING.
-THANK YOU.
HOW MANY CALORIES?
SO, THE SERVING SIZE IS THREE
PIECES, AND IT HAS 120 CALORIES.
IT ONLY HAS
EIGHT INGREDIENTS.
MMM-MMM-MMM.
NO PRESERVATIVES,
NOTHING ARTIFICIAL.
CAN YOU COOK THEM
IN A MICROWAVE?
-NO.
-NO.
-WHAT?
-BECAUSE WE SELL
AS FROZEN DOUGH,
YOU GOT TO BAKE IT,
BUT IT'S REALLY EASY.
IT'S STRAIGHT FROM THE FREEZER
TO THE OVEN.
IF YOU CAN BAKE FROZEN PIZZA
AT HOME,
YOU CAN MAKE BRAZI BITES.
IT'S THAT EASY.
HOW MANY STORES ARE YOU IN?
WE ARE NOW AVAILABLE
IN ABOUT 700 GROCERY STORES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
WE ARE, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN WHOLE FOODS MARKET.
WE ARE IN
SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET.
AND HOW DID YOU
GET TO THOSE PEOPLE?
DO YOU HAVE SALES REPS?
CAMERON AND I
KNOCKED ON DOORS AND --
JUST POUNDING THE PAVEMENT
LOCALLY.
YOURSELF.
WHEN DID YOU
START THE BUSINESS?
Cameron: THREE YEARS AGO.
SINCE THEN, WE'VE TRIPLED OUR
REVENUE EVERY YEAR, BASICALLY,
SO IN 2013,
WE DID $60,000.
WE DID $200,000
THE YEAR AFTER THAT.
LAST YEAR, WE DID $600,000,
AND THIS YEAR, WE'RE ACTUALLY
ON TRACK TO DO OVER $1 MILLION.
WOW.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
BUT JUNEA AND CAMERON
HAVE THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE
FOR THEIR BRAZILIAN
CHEESE BREAD, BRAZI BITES.
GUYS, YOU'VE GOT A FEEDING
FRENZY FOR YOUR BRAZILIAN BITES.
KEVIN, CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
YOUR VISION FOR THE COMPANY?
YOU KNOW,
THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS IS
IT'S ONE-AT-A-TIME SALE
INTO PLACES LIKE
EVERY RETAILER THAT CARRIES
ANYTHING IN THE FROZEN CATEGORY.
Greiner: TO ME, I SEE YOUR REAL
HOOK RIGHT NOW, YOUR FIRST STEP
IS TO DOMINATE ALL OF THE
NATURAL AND ORGANIC FOOD PLACES
FIRST SO THAT YOU CAN
GET REALLY STRONG
AND MAKE YOUR BRAND KNOWN.
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE FOUND IN
THE OTHER GROCERY CHAINS,
IT'LL BE RECOGNIZED.
Cameron: THEY MADE A MULTI-TIER
INVESTMENT THAT INVOLVED CASH,
A LINE OF CREDIT, AND THEY'RE
BUILDING OUT A FACILITY.
THEY'RE ORDERING
CUSTOM EQUIPMENT FROM BRAZIL.
Herjavec: HERE'S WHERE IT
KIND OF FALLS APART FOR ME.
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
SOLD 50% OF IT.
-I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER PARTNER.
-MM-HMM.
THEY'RE NOT HERE
REPRESENTING ANYTHING.
AT THIS POINT IN THE GROWTH,
IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME.
I'M OUT.
-OKAY.
-THANK YOU, ROBERT.
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
GUYS, LET'S JUST SAY
YOU MADE $25 MILLION.
BA-BAM, RIGHT?
FOR OUR 10%,
ONLY $2.5 COMES TO ME.
MM-HMM.
THE RISK-REWARD
HAS GOT TO BE GREATER.
NOW, THAT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY --
$200,000 TO $2.5 MILLION.
THAT SEEMS ENORMOUS.
BUT IT'S ALL RELATIVE
TO THE AMOUNT OF WORK INVOLVED.
SO EVEN IN
YOUR OPTIMAL SCENARIO,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH,
SO FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.
-THANK YOU, MARK.
-FAIR ENOUGH.
JUST TO ADDRESS YOUR OFFERS,
WE'D SAY THAT WE'D KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU GUYS BRING TO THE TABLE,
BUT 25% IS JUST
MORE THAN WE'RE CAPABLE OF --
Herjavec:
CAMERON, MAKE A COUNTER.
Greiner: SEE, THAT'S WHAT'S
INTERESTING THAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU COME INTO
THE SHARK TANK
AND YOU'VE GIVEN AWAY 50%
OF YOUR COMPANY TO SOMEONE ELSE.
-IT'S A PROBLEM.
-RIGHT?
IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO NEGOTIATE.
LORI, WOULD YOU MATCH
KEVIN'S OFFER FOR 15%?
WOW, YOU'RE NOT A SHARK.
YOU'RE CHOPPED TUNA.
O'Leary: JUST TO
MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING,
I'LL DROP MINE TO 12.5%.
SO, KEVIN, IN THAT CASE,
WOULD YOU JUST GO TO OUR 10%
AND GIVE US --
-YEAH, RIGHT.
-I'LL DO IT FOR 12.5%.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S WHAT HE DESERVED.
-I'LL DO IT RIGHT NOW AT 12.5%.
-OKAY.
JUNEA, YOU'VE GOT TO
MAKE SOME DECISION.
IS THAT YOUR FINAL OFFER?
IT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
THAT'S AS LOW AS I'LL GO.
OTHERWISE,
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.
-DAYMOND?
-I'LL GO TO 20%.
-I'LL MATCH LORI.
-ALL RIGHT.
SO TWO OFFERS FOR 20%,
ONE AT 12.5%.
I'LL GO TO 18%.
WOW.
HEY,
YOU GOT SHARKS ON DISCOUNT.
UM...
LORI WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO
DO THE DEAL FOR 15%?
OOH.
25% TO 15%.
I'M WORRIED.
DON'T BE.
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT. YOU HAVE
GREAT ENTREPRENEURS HERE.
THIS IS
A SUCCESSFUL BRAND.
YOU ARE A SUCCESSFUL BRAND
ALREADY,
BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES
TO GO THROUGH, TOO.
-ABSOLUTELY.
-AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED --
A SHARK.
IT'S GONNA BE BIG.
18% I WAS AT,
AND YOU WANT ME TO GO TO 15%.
YES.
I'LL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.
$200,000 FOR 16.5%.
O'Leary: LET ME MAKE IT
MORE INTERESTING FOR YOU.
I'M OUT.
YEAH. I'M OUT.
LORI, YOU GOT A DEAL.
[ GASPS ]
THEY ARE DELICIOUS.
THAT REALLY PUSHED ME
OVER THE EDGE
BECAUSE FOR GLUTEN-FREE
TO BE THAT TASTY...
-OH, MY GOD.
-THANK YOU.
-IT'S AWESOME.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-THANK YOU.
-WE'RE STOKED.
-GREAT RECIPE.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-THANK YOU.
-OKAY.
Junea: WE WERE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT LORI
BECAUSE SHE'S DONE GREAT THINGS
WITH CONSUMER PRODUCTS.
AND WE KNOW
THAT WITH HER HELP,
WE CAN MAKE BRAZI BITES
THE COMPANY
THAT INTRODUCES BRAZILIAN
CHEESE BREAD TO THE U.S.
Narrator: IN SEASON 6,
NEAL HOFFMAN MADE A DEAL
WITH LORI GREINER
AND ROBERT HERJAVEC
FOR HIS HANUKKAH TOY COMPANY,
MENSCH ON A BENCH.
Hoffman:
A MENSCH IS A DO-GOODER.
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN
TO GROW UP TO BE.
I LOVE THE IDEA OF
TEACHING GOOD VALUES AND MORALS.
$150,000 FOR 15%.
COME ON IN!
Narrator:
LET'S SEE HOW HE'S DOING NOW.
