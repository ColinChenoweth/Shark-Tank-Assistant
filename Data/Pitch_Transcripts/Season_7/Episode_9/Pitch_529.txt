Alex: OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IS INVENTORY.
WE ARE MISSING OPPORTUNITIES.
...OR THEY'LL
WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.
I JUST LOVE YOU GUYS,
BUT IT HAS TO BE WORTH MY TIME.
I'M NOT GONNA WORK PART-TIME
FOR MY DREAM.
YOU HAVE
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON.
PICK ONE BUSINESS
AND GROW THAT PART.
WHY?
THEY ALL MAKE MONEY.
Narrator:
WHO ARE THE SHARKS?
THEY'RE SELF-MADE
BUSINESS EXPERTS WORTH BILLIONS.
KEVIN O'LEARY IS
A SHREWD VENTURE CAPITALIST
WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE
SELLING A CHILDREN'S
EDUCATIONAL COMPANY
FOR OVER $4 BILLION.
I'M JONATHAN TORREY.
AND I'M HIS BROTHER,
ALEX TORREY,
AND WE LIVE IN
ATHENS, GEORGIA.
OKAY,
LET'S TRY THE GUACAMOLE.
Alex: WE COME FROM A SUPER
TIGHT-KNIT MEXICAN FAMILY,
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT
WE HAVE A BUSINESS TOGETHER
AND THE WHOLE FAMILY
PITCHES IN.
CAN I HELP?
WE'VE DEVELOPED A UNIQUE
FASHION BRAND CALLED UMANO.
WE KNOW THAT CLOTHING
IS A REALLY GREAT WAY
TO EXPRESS YOUR CREATIVITY,
AND WE WANT TO BUILD
A FASHION BRAND
THAT HAS A REALLY POSITIVE
SOCIAL IMPACT.
POPS, CAN YOU MAKE SURE
WE ORDER SOME MORE INK?
JONATHAN AND I HAVE PUT
EVERYTHING INTO UMANO.
WE MOVED BACK HOME
WITH OUR PARENTS.
WE SHARE A ROOM LIKE WE DID
WHEN WE WERE 7 YEARS OLD.
WE DID THAT WILLINGLY
BECAUSE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT
UMANO HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.
WE'RE GONNA DO
TWO BLACK V-NECKS.
Man: YEAH.
-IS THAT RIGHT?
-WE'VE GOT THEM RIGHT HERE.
BECAUSE OF OUR MISSION,
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
COUNTING ON US
THAT WE WANT UMANO
TO BE ABLE TO HELP.
BUT NOW, WITH INCREASING DEMAND,
WE'RE MISSING OPPORTUNITIES
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
INVENTORY AS WE SHOULD.
Jonathan: WE HOPE THE SHARKS
WILL JOIN OUR MOVEMENT.
WHERE YOU CAN LOOK GOOD
AND DO GOOD.
Jonathan: HI, SHARKS!
MY NAME IS JONATHAN, AND THIS IS
MY LITTLE BROTHER, ALEX.
WE'RE FROM ATHENS, GEORGIA,
AND WE'RE SEEKING $150,000
FOR 15% EQUITY IN OUR BUSINESS.
UMANO IS FASHION FOR GOOD.
WE DESIGN MEN'S AND WOMEN'S
ELEVATED FASHION BASICS
WITH A PERSONALIZED MEANING
TO CONNECT PEOPLE
TO A BIGGER PURPOSE.
THE AWESOME ARTWORK
YOU SEE HERE IS CURATED FROM
SOME OF THE MOST AMAZING
UP-AND-COMING ARTISTS --
KIDS!
SHARKS, MEET JESSICA.
SHE DREW THE SKULL
AND WANTS TO BE A TEACHER.
Cuban: HOW OLD IS SHE?
SHE'S 7.
[ LAUGHS ]
WEARING UMANO IS A BADGE OF
PRIDE, AND IT'S A PLEDGE,
BECAUSE WITH EVERY PRODUCT
YOU PURCHASE,
UMANO WILL GIVE A BACKPACK
FULL OF SCHOOL SUPPLIES
TO EMPOWER
YOUNG CREATIVE MINDS.
INVESTING IN UMANO
MEANS THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
DOING WELL AND DOING GOOD.
SO WHO WANTS TO
TAKE A RIDE WITH US
ON THIS ELEPHANT,
THE TINY DANCER,
DRAWN BY
5-YEAR-OLD EMANUEL.
OR THIS BIKE, THE FIX-E, DRAWN
BY FUTURE FIREFIGHTER RUBEN.
[ CHUCKLES ]
WE HAVE HAND-PICKED SOME OF OUR
FAVORITE DESIGNS TO SHOW YOU,
AND WE'LL SHARE THEM
WITH YOU NOW.
-YES, SIR.
-THANK YOU, JONATHAN.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
-THANK YOU.
-HERE, MR. WONDERFUL.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-YOU ARE VERY WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
IT'S REALLY NICE.
FEELS SOFT.
Alex:
WE HAVE TRAVELED THE WORLD,
LITERALLY, TO GET THAT FABRIC.
FIRST OF ALL, HOW MUCH IS IT,
AND HOW DO I BUY IT?
THOSE SHIRTS THAT YOU HAVE,
THEY START RETAILING AT $48.
WE ARE SOLD
AT BLOOMINGDALE'S.
WE ARE SOLD AT SPECIALTY STORES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND THROUGH OUR WEB SITE.
DOES IT HAVE THE CHILD'S PICTURE
HANGING AT BLOOMINGDALE'S?
YES,
THE WAY IT'S HANG-TAGGED
IS WITH THE HANG-TAG
THAT YOU CURRENTLY SEE ON IT.
Alex:
SO, THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED NOW
IS THAT WE HAVE
A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH ALL OF
OUR PARTNER SCHOOLS.
WE GIVE THE BACKPACKS
FULL OF SCHOOL SUPPLIES,
COLLECT THE DRAWINGS,
COME BACK TO ATHENS, GEORGIA,
TO CREATE THE ARTWORK.
SO AS THE BRAND EXPANDS,
WE WILL EXPAND THE GIVING.
CAN I ASK -- IS THIS A BUSINESS
OR IS THIS IS A CHARITY?
WE ARE A BUSINESS 100%.
SO YOUR PURSUIT
IS FOR PROFIT.
THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL
ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS TO USE --
Cuban:
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED, RIGHT?
THE LAST FIVE YEARS, RIGHT?
WHEN PEOPLE ARE WALK IN,
PARTICULARLY MILLENNIALS,
THEY DON'T JUST WALK IN
AND BUY A PRODUCT.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
THEY WALK IN
AND BUY A CAUSE.
BUT TO SUSTAIN IT,
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A PROFIT.
-WELL, NO, THEY GO HAND-IN-HAND.
-WE DO.
WE HAVE THE MARGINS
TO DO THAT.
Herjavec:
THE T-SHIRT IS $48.
-YES, SIR.
-WALK ME HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR IT
AND THEN HOW MUCH THE GIFT BAG
COSTS THAT GOES BACK.
-RETAIL $48.
-OKAY.
THE COST OF THE PRODUCT, $7.
THE BACKPACK AND SCHOOL SUPPLIES
IS $4,
SO WE LOAD UP TOTAL
AT $11.
WE HAVE A 48% MARGIN-PLUS.
WHERE ARE THESE SCHOOLS?
ARE THEY IN COUNTRIES OF NEED?
Alex:
WE HAVE SCHOOLS EVERYWHERE.
WE HAVE PARTNER SCHOOLS
OVERSEAS,
IN PLACES LIKE MEXICO AND PERU,
WHERE WE MANUFACTURE IN HAITI,
BUT ALSO RIGHT HERE AT HOME
IN ATHENS, GEORGIA, FOR US,
LOS ANGELES,
HARLEM, NEW YORK.
WHAT WERE YOUR SALES
LAST YEAR,
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO
THIS YEAR?
LAST YEAR,
WE SOLD $106,000.
THIS YEAR, WE'RE SCHEDULED
TO CLOSE AT $250,000.
GETTING INTO BLOOMINGDALE'S
IS SO HARD.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
IT'S NOT JUST GETTING INTO
BLOOMINGDALE'S,
BUT THE DOORS WE'RE IN.
WE'RE IN 59th STREET,
WE'RE IN SOHO,
WE'RE IN
THE FLAGSHIP STORES.
THE REASON WE GOT IN
IS BECAUSE OF THE STORY.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE
ANY INVENTORY RIGHT NOW?
-WE DO.
-OKAY, HOW MUCH IS THAT?
8,000 UNITS.
Alex:
THOSE 8,000 ARE ALREADY SOLD.
DO YOU PLAN TO BE
A T-SHIRT COMPANY OR --
WHAT'S THE FULL EXPANSION
OF THE LINE?
WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO BE
A LIFESTYLE BRAND,
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SHOW YOU A
PREVIEW OF OUR SPRING '16 LINE.
SURE.
OH, THAT'S COOL.
THESE ARE DRESSES, THESE
ARE ROMPERS, THESE ARE LEGGINGS,
HOODIES, ZIP-UP, AND THAT'S
JUST ON THE WOMEN'S SIDE.
O'Leary: GUYS, LET'S SAY
YOU GET TO $10 MILLION IN SALES.
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY RISK
THAT PEOPLE WILL TURN AROUND
AND SAY,
"LET ME GET THIS RIGHT.
THE CHILDREN GET A BAG
WORTH 4 BUCKS.
YOU GUYS ARE NOW MAKING $4
MILLION A YEAR IN PROFIT,
PRE-TAX."
IT'S CHILD LABOR.
I MEAN, I COULD SEE A
NEGATIVE STORY DEVELOPING HERE.
-THAT'S A STRETCH THERE.
-THAT'S --
-KEVIN!
-IT'S DEFINITELY NOT.
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
THE BIGGER BRANDS CAN'T GO IN
AND DO WHAT WE'RE DOING --
THIS IS GRASSROOTS.
-JONATHAN AND I --
-WHY? WHY CAN'T THEY DO THAT?
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE GONNA BE UNDER
-THE GREATEST MICROSCOPE.
-CORRECT.
IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT
FOR US TO MAKE
THAT AS THE BRAND GROWS,
WE WILL GROW THE GIVING.
Herjavec: I THINK THE DESIGNS
ARE BEAUTIFUL,
AND I APPLAUD YOU
FOR THE CAUSE.
I AGREE WITH YOU
THAT PEOPLE TODAY
CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE BUYING
AND WHY THEY'RE BUYING.
ABSOLUTELY.
SO YOU'RE REALLY A DESIGN
COMPANY WITH A GREAT CAUSE.
TOUGH BUSINESS, BECAUSE
DESIGNS ARE LIKE RESTAURANTS --
SOMETHING'S HOT TODAY,
IT'S NOT HOT TOMORROW.
I SEE A LOT OF RISK.
I'M OUT.
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-YEAH.
-AND ON THAT NOTE,
AS YOU GUYS
HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED,
FOR US,
MILLENNIALS ARE EXPANDING.
BY 2018, THEY WILL SURPASS
THE PURCHASING POWER
OF BABY BOOMERS, AND THOSE --
OUR FAVORITE BRANDS
ARE BEING DISCOVERED RIGHT NOW.
O'Leary:
GUYS, LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT IT.
LOOK, IT'S VERY CREATIVE
AND IT'S GOOD-LOOKING STUFF.
WE'VE SEEN
A LOT OF T-SHIRTS
COME THROUGH
THE "SHARK TANK" DOOR.
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
THERE'S NO QUESTION
ABOUT IT.
BUT IT'S EMBRYONIC.
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A SHARK
THAT WANTS TO
START YOUR JOURNEY HERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT ME.
I'M OUT.
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-THANK YOU.
WHAT'S HOLDING YOU GUYS BACK?
WHAT CAN WE ANSWER?
YOU SAID THE 8,000 UNITS
WERE ALREADY SOLD.
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?
TO FULFILL THE BLOOMINGDALE'S
ORDERS UNTIL DECEMBER.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
TO GO OUT AND SOURCE MORE.
Alex: CORRECT. OUR BIGGEST
CHALLENGE IS INVENTORY,
AND WE'RE
MISSING OPPORTUNITIES.
BLOOMINGDALE'S
IS ASKING FOR MORE DOORS.
WE CAN'T DO THAT.
Greiner: YOU GUYS ARE SCRAPPY,
YOU HAVE A COOL LOOK.
I LIKE ENTREPRENEURS THAT ARE
WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
YOU GUYS
SEEM THAT WAY TO ME.
-THANK YOU.
-AND I LIKE YOUR MISSION.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AN OFFER.
I'M GONNA GIVE $150,000
BUT FOR 25%.
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE JUST STARTING.
THERE'S A LOT OF DESIGN WORK TO
DO, THERE'S MORE SOURCING TO DO.
I THINK THAT I CAN HELP YOU
A LOT WITH THAT.
-THANK YOU.
-SO THAT'S MY OFFER.
-THAT'S AN AMAZING OFFER.
-CONGRATULATIONS.
-WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
-YOU GOT AN OFFER.
DO YOU ACCEPT IT?
THERE ARE TWO MORE SHARKS. WE
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN --
JONATHAN AND I
HAVE WORKED THREE YEARS,
-GIVING EVERYTHING WE HAVE.
-BUT, WAIT.
YOU HAVE ANOTHER SHARK.
YOU STILL HAVE MR. CUBAN.
CORRECT. SO WE WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR FROM HIM.
I LOVE
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING.
REALLY WHERE YOU NEED THE HELP
ISN'T IN THE SALES.
-YOU NEED CREDIT, BASICALLY.
-CORRECT.
-AND YOU NEED ONLINE HELP.
-CORRECT.
I'LL MAKE AN OFFER
OF 150K FOR 20%.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE OPTION.
IF LORI WANTS TO COME IN
OR DAYMOND WANTS TO COME IN,
THAT'S FINE
JUST BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD CAUSE.
BUT I'M HAPPY
TO DO IT BY MYSELF.
-I'D GO IN WITH YOU.
-DAYMOND, ANY INTEREST?
I HAVE NO NEED FOR NON-CLOTHING
INDIVIDUALS IN MY DEAL.
O'Leary:
WHAT AN INTERESTING SITUATION.
Jonathan:
THROUGH OUR JOURNEY,
WE'VE PROBABLY HEARD
100 NOs TO ONE YES.
Alex: 100,000 NOs.
SO THESE YESES REALLY HELPED NOT
ONLY BUILD OUR OWN CONFIDENCE
BUT ALSO THE TEAM'S
THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
Narrator:
NEXT UP IS A SOLUTION TO
A PERSISTENT HOUSEHOLD PROBLEM.
