MY NAME IS
TRACIE BURRESS.
AND I'M GLEN BURRESS.
-AND WE'RE SEEKING $50,000...
-$50,000.
...INVESTMENT FOR 20% EQUITY
IN OUR COMPANY.
WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND
IS GOING TO ELIMINATE THE WORST
PART ABOUT DOING LAUNDRY.
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO
SHARE WITH YOU A LOVE STORY
ABOUT A LOVELY SOCK COUPLE
NAMED SAL.
OH, LORD.
...AND SALLY TUBESOCK.
I LOVE SOCK PUPPETS.
THEY HAD
A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP.
ONE DAY, THEY WENT IN
FOR THEIR WEEKLY WASH,
GAVE EACH OTHER A LONG
PASSIONATE KISS GOODBYE.
Both: MWAH!
[ GIGGLES ]
HANG ON, MY LOVE.
THIS RIDE COULD GET ROUGH.
I'LL SEE YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE.
-OH, THIS IS HORRIBLE.
-[ LAUGHS ]
SAL AND SALLY BOTH WENT INTO
THE WASHER AND DRYER TOGETHER,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
ONLY SAL CAME OUT.
-OH, NO!
-NO!
[ LAUGHTER ]
SINCE SAL HAS JUST LOST
HIS "SOLE MATE"
TO THE DREADED
SOCK MONSTER.
AND NOW
SAL IS FORCED TO JOIN
THE LONELY, SINGLE,
MATELESS SOCK CLUB.
SOCKTABS WILL MAKE SURE
THAT EVERY SOCK
CAN KEEP TABS ON ITS MATE
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE
LAUNDRY PROCESS.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
ONE SOCKTAB STAYS ON ONE SOCK
AT ALL TIMES,
THAT WAY YOU WEAR IT
THROUGHOUT THE DAY,
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU SIMPLY PINCH THE WINGS,
TAB IT THROUGH ITS MATE,
AND YOUR SOCKS ARE READY
TO GO INTO THE HAMPER...
Both: TOGETHER.
INTO THE WASHER...
TOGETHER.
AND WHEN YOU
OPEN UP THAT DRYER,
YOUR SOCKS, GUESS WHAT,
COME OUT...
TOGETHER!
[ GIGGLES ]
Greiner:
ARE YOU HANDING OUT SAMPLES?
YES.
Herjavec:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SO, TRACIE,
DOESN'T THIS HURT?
Tracie:
YOU REALLY DO NOT FEEL IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
ONCE YOU PUT IT ON,
YOU DON'T FEEL IT.
O'Leary: SO,
WHAT ARE YOUR NUMBERS LIKE?
WHAT DOES IT COST YOU
TO MAKE A PACKAGE?
WHAT DO YOU SELL IT FOR?
WHAT ARE THE MARGINS?
Glen:
OKAY, A PACKAGE OF 24 IS $1.25.
ABOUT $1.25
FOR US TO MAKE IT.
WE SELL IT TO OUR WHOLESALERS
AT $4.99.
Herjavec:
HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD, TRACIE?
TO DATE,
AND WE JUST STARTED,
'CAUSE THIS IS NOT
A PRE-REVENUE SITUATION --
HERE WE GO.
WAIT FOR IT.
UH-OH.
THIS IS AN EARLY-REVENUE
SITUATION.
SO TO DATE, WE'VE SOLD JUST OVER
$20,000 IN ABOUT MAYBE...
-SIX MONTHS.
-RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
HOW HAVE YOU SOLD IT?
THROUGH WHICH CHANNELS?
FIRST OF ALL,
JUST GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
EVERY SINGLE RETAILER
IN ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS,
THAT I HAVE PURSUED
WITH SOCKTABS,
THEY'RE ALL CARRYING IT.
SO YOU'RE CALLING THEM
ONE AT A TIME?
SO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
IN ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS,
YOU'VE SOLD $20,000.
ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS
WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU.
-WELL, SOME ARE ONLINE.
-WE HAVE ONLINE SALES, AS WELL.
OKAY,
HOW MUCH ARE ONLINE?
ABOUT 60% IS RETAIL,
40% ONLINE.
Greiner: LISTEN.
I LOVE YOU GUYS,
BUT I KNOW PEOPLE THAT SELL
THINGS THAT PUT SOCKS TOGETHER.
OKAY.
THERE'S AT LEAST
FIVE, SIX BRANDS
-I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW...
-REALLY?
...WHERE -- YES, THERE ARE.
I KNOW.
-YOU KNOW WHAT?
-I KNOW BECAUSE I HELPED THEM
WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF THEIR MARKETING.
WE HAVE NEVER SAID
THAT THERE WAS NO COMPETITORS
OUT THERE, LORI.
THE DIFFERENCE
WITH OUR PRODUCT
THAT YOU GUYS
REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND --
THIS HAS A DUAL PURPOSE.
THE DUAL PURPOSE IS THAT IT
CAN A FASHION ACCESSORY, OKAY?
-FASHION.
-A FASHION ACCESSORY?
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE
A CUFF LINK FOR YOUR SOCKS.
-CUSTOMIZABLE.
-SO THINK ABOUT IT.
-TEAM COLORS.
-WE CAN PUT TEAMS ON HERE.
-TEAM LOGO.
-TRACIE, YOU ARE A HUSTLER.
-I AM.
-YOU ARE 100%.
I'M FROM THE SOUTH SIDE,
AND I BELIEVE IN MY PRODUCT.
MY PROBLEM HERE IS
I KNOW PEOPLE THAT MAKE VERY
COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS TO THIS.
I THINK IT WOULD BE A CONFLICT
FOR THIS BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE TO BE OUT.
Herjavec:
TRACIE, YOU KNOW,
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE BOUGHT
A LOT OF THIS PRODUCT
BECAUSE OF THE POWER
AND UNIVERSE OF TRACIE.
I BELIEVE THAT.
I THINK
YOU COULD SELL ANY PRODUCT.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE GIVING ME
A LOT OF CREDIT.
TRACIE, LOOK, I'M GONNA LET YOU
FOCUS ON THE RIGHT SHARK.
I'M NOT THE RIGHT SHARK
FOR THIS DEAL.
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM
IN LOSING SOCKS.
I DON'T SEE ME
PUTTING THIS IN MY SOCKS.
AMERICA DOES.
ANYONE THAT HAS FEET.
AND THERE'S A COMPETITIVE
PRODUCT. I'M OUT.
THAT'S 'CAUSE ALL OF HIS SOCKS
ARE DIFFERENT COLORS
AND DIFFERENT STYLES
AND DIFFERENT PATTERNS.
-LET'S TAKE STOCK.
-I'M OUT!
SO, GUYS,
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?
WELL, I'M A PRODUCT OF
THE INNER CITY OF CHICAGO.
I'M THE VERY FIRST PERSON OUT OF
ABOUT 27 OF MY FIRST COUSINS
TO ACTUALLY GRADUATE
FROM COLLEGE.
I'M NOW
A PHARMACEUTICAL SALES REP.
I'VE WON THE PRESIDENTIAL AWARD
RESERVED FOR ONLY THE TOP 7%.
YEAH!
WHAT ABOUT YOU, GLEN?
SAME THING --
RAISED ON THE SOUTH SIDE,
MY MOTHER WORKED TWO JOBS TO PUT
MY SISTER AND I THROUGH SCHOOL.
WENT TO NORTHWESTERN, UNIVERSITY
OF ILLINOIS MEDICAL SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
FOR RESIDENCY,
AND NOW I'VE BEEN IN
PRACTICE 19 YEARS.
WOW.
Tracie:
WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO IS
MAINTAIN THE SOCKS
THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE.
YOU KNOW HOW MANY MOMS
ARE AFRAID TO SPEND $20
ON THEIR 12-YEAR-OLD?
NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT.
GUYS, I GOT IT.
LISTEN. I GOT --
YOU KNOW
THOSE FASHIONABLE SOCKS
THAT THEY'RE WEARING WITH
THE FLIP-FLOPS?
SOCCER SOCKS!
GUYS, I'M SORRY.
I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M OUT.
NO, DAYMOND.
OKAY.
ALL IS NOT LOST, TRACIE.
MARK'S STILL IN.
-SO IS KEVIN.
-I AM, THAT'S TRUE.
I WISH YOU HADN'T
BROUGHT THAT UP.
CAN YOU IMAGINE
A MICKEY MOUSE?
OKAY, YOU GUYS
ARE KIND OF THINKING
THAT
I'M A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE.
NO.
THREE YEARS AGO,
I HAD A BRAIN ANEURYSM.
I WAS AIRLIFTED
FROM ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS,
TO NORTHWESTERN HOSPITAL
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
FOLLOWED BY
AN 11-HOUR BRAIN SURGERY.
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT GOD BROUGHT ME BACK
STRONGER AND MORE FEISTY
THAN EVER.
MARK. KEVIN.
ARE YOU IN? ARE YOU OUT?
Narrator: THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.
TRACIE AND GLEN ONLY HAVE
TWO MORE CHANCES
TO GET A DEAL FOR THEIR COMPANY,
SOCKTABS.
MARK. KEVIN.
ARE YOU IN? ARE YOU OUT?
GUYS, LOOK. I DON'T WANT TO
BE IN THE SOCKTAB BUSINESS.
THAT'S JUST THE HONEST-TO-GOD
TRUTH, RIGHT?
YEAH.
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
MATCH YOUR PASSION ON THIS.
AND THAT'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM,
RIGHT?
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO BE THE ENTREPRENEUR.
LET ME DO THAT.
I JUST NEED AN INVESTMENT.
-WELL, LOOK.
-I NEED THE INVESTMENT.
GOING OUT
AND GETTING $50,000,
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S YOUR STUMBLING BLOCK.
I THINK YOU WANT
SOMEBODY WHO CAN MATCH
YOUR DESIRE
TO BE SUCCESSFUL
THAT CAN BE THERE
WHEN YOU NEED THEM, RIGHT?
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE
A FORCE OF NATURE.
I DON'T THINK
I CAN BE THERE FOR YOU.
I'M OUT.
Greiner: SO ONE SHARK LEFT.
O'Leary:
TRACIE, WHAT I DON'T LIKE --
YOU'RE NOT FULL-TIME
ON THIS DEAL.
YOU'RE DOING IT AROUND YOUR JOB,
WHICH IS VERY LUCRATIVE, ONE,
IF YOU'RE A SUCCESSFUL
PHARMA REP.
YOUR HUSBAND IS A DOCTOR.
HE'S BUSY.
WHO'S TAKING CARE OF
THE SOCKTABS?
THERE'S NO FULL-TIME PERSON.
IT'S AN IDEA, IT'S A PRODUCT.
-IT'S NOT A COMPANY.
-YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN?
SO THAT'S AN ISSUE.
I WILL DO
WHATEVER I NEED TO DO.
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
TO MY LIFE
HAS PREPARED ME
FOR THIS MOMENT,
AND I'M NOT GONNA WORK
PART-TIME FOR MY DREAM.
NO, BUT LOOK --
I CAN ASSURE YOU
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T THINK BUSINESS
CAN EVER REPLACE THE INCOME
THAT YOU'RE MAKING
AS A PHARMA REP,
'CAUSE
I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
-THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
-IT'S A GOOD NUMBER.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
DO THAT TO YOUR FAMILY.
AND I WOULD NOT
PUT THAT IN JEOPARDY.
I'M SORRY.
I'M OUT.
THANK YOU, GUYS.
-ALL RIGHT.
-I APPRECIATE IT.
-THANK YOU, GUYS.
-THANK YOU.
-GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
-BYE.
-THANK YOU.
TRACIE.
I'LL GIVE YOU $50,000 FOR 30%,
IF MY BOMBAS GUYS AGREE.
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
COME ON.
OF COURSE.
-WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
-ALL RIGHT.
-AWW.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-I APPRECIATE IT.
-AND DIDN'T WANT TO WALK OUT.
I REALLY DO.
I FEEL YOU.
-ALL RIGHT.
-THANKS, MAN.
-THANK YOU.
-APPRECIATE IT.
WE JUST NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO SEE OUR VISION,
AND FORTUNATELY, AT THE LAST
MOMENT, DAYMOND SAW IT.
AND THAT'S
WHAT WE WANTED ANYWAY.
WE REALLY WANTED DAYMOND.
-[ LAUGHS ]
-YES.
ALL THAT HARD WORK.
-I KNOW.
-WOW. MAN.
