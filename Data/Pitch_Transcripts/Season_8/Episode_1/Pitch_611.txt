Hi, Sharks.
I'm Phil Petracca.
And I'm David McDonald.
We are the founders of Fizzics
from Newark, New Jersey.
We're seeking
a $500,000 investment
for 4% equity
in our company.
Wow.
Fizzics is changing the way
people are drinking beer
at home and on the go.
Beer is pretty awesome,
and we all know that beer
tastes best fresh from the tap.
After all,
that's how the brewers
intended their beers
to taste.
But in order to reach
the masses,
beer is sold in cans
and bottles worldwide.
And unfortunately
for us beer lovers,
it just doesn't taste as good
as it does fresh from the tap.
But drab beer is a thing
of the past with Fizzics ??
the world's first and only
portable draft?beer system
that delivers an awesome...
Better?than?tap...
...experience from any can
or bottle.
Simply place any size can
or any size bottle...
Oh, you put a can in there?
...even up to
a 64?ounce growler
into the system and insert
the feed tube.
Pull the tap handle forward,
and the system will begin
to pour the beer
under pressure at a controlled
rate with no gas,
no chemicals,
and no replaceable cartridges.
And then when you push
the handle
in the backwards position,
behold, the magic of science.
Utilizing sound waves,
we perfect the density,
stability, and texture
of the foam,
enhancing the aroma and flavor
of an authentic draft beer.
?What?!
?Wow!
[ Laughter ]
Who's ready to enjoy the great
taste of a Fizzics beer?
?Bring it!
?Because after all...
Both:
... tasting is believing!
Cheers.
?Cheers.
?Cheers, Sharks.
?Let's try it.
?Bring it.
?Thank you.
So, we've selected some beers
for you.
We'll be serving you a hand pour
and a Fizzics pour,
so you can do a side?by?side
comparison
and taste the difference.
Interesting.
For you, we have a classic
American lager.
This is the regular one.
This is the regular one,
and then the one with the head
on it is a Fizzics pour.
?Got it.
?Bring us a whole lot of them.
[ Laughter ]
Thank you.
Try the little one.
All right, so, I tried
the normal one.
Yo, Sharkies,
to going six deep!
Cheers!
?Cheers!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Wow.
That was really good.
It's like a dessert.
Delicious.
?Raspberry.
?Oh, definitely smoother.
Definitely better.
?Like night and day.
?Oh, that's a good beer.
?Oh, that is good.
?Isn't that good?
?Yeah.
?And that's from a can.
?This is good.
That's from a can.
The foam is really good.
The foam is
the most critical element
of the beer?drinking
experience.
Can I get a share of hands,
Sharks?
Who feels that the Fizzics is
better than the other one?
I would say this definitely
advances the flavor.
?Oh, much better.
?Night and day.
Night and day. They're like
two different beers.
Herjavec:
Let me try the dark one.
We always say tasting
is believing.
?Believe me, I was...
?Hands down.
...very skeptical
when I saw this.
?Right.
?Yeah, me too.
O'Leary: So you've
achieved something.
Now, I've looked at
the valuation, and I say,
"Are you guys out of
your freaking minds?"
Well, Kevin, we just started
shipping product
eight months ago.
[ Groans ]
And we've done $3.2 million
in sales.
?Good for you. Wow.
?Okay.
?Not bad. Not bad.
?You just started shipping.
?How have you been selling them?
?How much does that cost?
This retails for $199.
And what does it cost you
to make?
$35.88.
?Oh, wow. Good for you.
?Good mark?up.
?Really?
?Yeah.
So, we launched
a crowd?sourcing campaign.
Which one?
Which platform?
Indiegogo.
Our initial goal
was $50,000.
We did about $250,000
in our campaign.
?Wow.
?David and I quit our jobs
the next day,
and we've been running
ever since.
KH: Wow.
Tell us exactly how it works.
What's the technology
in there?
?Sure.
?Wow.
David and I
are technologists.
We've commercialized technology
our whole careers.
And what we found is the head
of the beer
is the most critical element of
the beer?drinking experience.
And what we've discovered is
if we're able to get
the density tightly,
densely packed,
uniform bubbles,
we can trick the brain
to say, "This is smooth.
This is creamy."
So we utilize sound waves.
David and I have developed
an oscillating sound pressure
wave generator.
?Sound wave?
?Do you have a patent?
We've applied
for two utility patents
and one international
utility patent.
Your current value that you're
asking right now
is $12.5 million.
?Correct.
?Wow.
?And we came in with a very
conservative valuation
because we're here
to get a deal.
?Yes.
?[ Chuckles ]
It's $1.3 multiple
of this year's revenue.
How? You're gonna do $3 million
this year.
No, we've already done
$3.2 million.
This year we're gonna do
$9 million.
So we're already
cash?flow positive.
We just turned a profit
of $220,000.
Herjavec:
I've heard enough.
You're asking for $500,000
for 4%.
I think you're here
to negotiate.
I'll give you the $500,000
for 8%.
Robert, thank you so much
for your offer.
We believe it's way
below market.
This is part of our Series "A"
round ?? have a lead?in ??
What was the Series "A" round
struck at?
$2 million.
We already have a lead
institutional investor.
So then why are you here?
Thee is a wise man
with great business acumen
that once said...
Yes, I'm here.
..."There are many V. C. s,
but there's only one
Shark Tank."
Well, that's why I made you
the offer at 8%.
You're making my case.
?Very good.
?Let me raise the ante.
Are you saying you're not
valuing the Sharks?
Let me raise the ante.
I don't ??
I don't disagree
with Robert.
The value of a Shark
is huge,
but there are Sharks
and then there's Mr. Wonderful.
Who's really not a Shark.
Because this falls
right into my...
Who's a guppy.
... right into my wine and food
business in a huge way.
I already have all
your customers.
I've got hundreds
of thousands of people
who buy direct from me.
They will trust me,
as they do in the wine business.
Nobody sells wine like I do.
So I will give you
the same offer ??
$500,000 for 8%.
I like this deal a lot.
I can move a lot of units ??
a lot.
What are your biggest
challenges?
Philip:
This is a challenge, Mark.
The great thing
about our company
is we're creating
a category.
The challenge with our company
is we're creating a category.
?Right.
?Mark, do you have an offer?
Cuban: I'm trying to find out,
you know,
if it seems too good to be true.
Corcoran: It's always too good
to be true.
I'm wildly enthusiastic
about the product,
but I'm not wildly enthusiastic
about you.
I feel like you're <i>too</i> slick.
You have <i>every</i> answer.
Narrator: All six Sharks
are still in.
David and Philip have two offers
on the table
for their draft?beer
system Fizzics,
but Barbara is skeptical
about the entrepreneurs.
I'm wildly enthusiastic
about the product,
but I'm not wildly enthusiastic
about you.
I feel like you're <i>too</i> slick.
You have <i>every</i> answer.
And my gut is ringing,
"There's got to be
something wrong."
You're too slick for me.
I don't trust you.
So I'm out.
Phil, the main reason that
I started to do this show
and love this program is all the
people that really need help.
You don't need any money.
You're cash flow positive.
Why are you here?
?We need to scale.
There are some retailers
that we want to go into
that we currently can't 'cause
we have channel conflict.
So, what I want to show ??
?Give me an example of that.
?What I want to show you all...
?Give me an example.
...is what we're anticipating
and what we're investing in.
You didn't even get
to your slides yet?
[ Laughter ]
Philip: This is our
next?generation product.
Phil, Phil, I'm just gonna
let everybody ??
Wait, wait, wait,
I want to see.
?Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil,
Phil, Phil, Phil!
?This is our next?generation ??
?Yes, sir?
?I'm out.
?Okay.
?Why'd you do that?
?Okay.
?Just let him go, Phil.
?Go, Phil.
?I'm not out.
?Wait, Phil. Phil.
?I'm still in, Phil.
He's out.
You got five more to go.
?I'm interested.
?We worked really hard
to be here.
Can you please show me
what that is?
And we have a lot to share. And
that's what we're trying to do.
So, this is Waytop.
We're gonna launch this.
This is a more cost?effective
price point.
It's much smaller.
?How is that different, though?
?What's the difference?
This one would only do a can
and up to a 12?ounce bottle.
Phil, the great thing for you
is I have QVC
and TV sales because you need to
get out there ?? education.
You need people
to know what it is.
?Absolutely.
?So it's free advertising.
So I am also going to give you
$500,000 for 8%.
Ooh, everybody seems stuck
at that 8%.
Everybody's at 8%.
Phil, just so you know,
this is a fact ??
the number?one provider of wine
on QVC is me.
Where do you want to go that you
can't get to right now?
Yeah, we want to be in Bed Bath
&amp; Beyond with that product.
Whoa! That's where I have
a huge relationship.
I think at $99 at Bed Bath
&amp; Beyond, they have ??
Cuban: Okay,
that makes more sense.
You know I have
a great relationship
with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Hello, Phil?
What about in commercial ??
in restaurants and bars?
?Phil, Phil, Phil?
?Tabletop type thing.
?Phil?
?What are you doing there?
So, we've had
some discussions.
Can it withstand
commercial abuse, right?
?Yes.
?Phil, you have three offers.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
Okay, so, I'm gonna make
an offer.
And I'll even open up to Lori
to come in on my offer.
So I'll offer you $800,000
for 10%.
That valuation is higher
than the $500,000 for 8%,
but it gives you more cash
so you can go to work faster,
and you have
either one or two Sharks.
I would like to make a counter
to Mark and Lori.
I like the deal.
All right, I think we would be
great partners.
This is our
Series "A" round.
If you wanted to take
the whole Series "A,"
we're looking
to raise $2 million
at a $10 million
pre?money valuation.
Yeah, right.
So that's 16%?
Yes. 16.67%.
?Well, I want to compete ??
?Okay, I'll do that deal.
?Done.
?Oh, my God!
?Deal!
?[ Laughs ]
?Put it up here, baby.
?It's really fabulous.
?Put it up here.
?Get up here.
?I'm not a beer drinker.
?You are now, baby!
?And you just converted me.
?You are now!
?I am now.
?You are now.
Whoo! [ Laughs ]
Yeah!
Yeah!
We did it!
We risked it all ??
left great jobs.
This is the American dream.
I'm just so full of emotion
right now.
[ Voice breaking ]
This is awesome.
[ Cries ]
It's okay.
Narrator: In Season 7,
Shaan Patel secured a deal
with Mark Cuban for his SAT
prep course 2400 Expert.
I'll offer you the 250k
for 20%.
All right,
I take your offer, Mark.
Done.
Narrator: Let's see
what he's up to now.
Patel: Since making my deal
with Mark,
we changed the name
from 2400 Expert
to Prep Expert because the SAT
went from the 2400 scale
back to the 1600 scale.
Welcome, everyone.
Today I'm teaching
a special program
to underserved youth in
my community of Las Vegas.
So, who's ready to do a problem?
They are high?achieving
but simply lack the resources
to get great standardized
test scores.
Give a big round of applause
for Mark Cuban!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Cuban:
Shaan has invited me out
to this program that he's doing
with his community,
and I thought it would be great
to come out here
and get the kids fired up
and have a good time.
It really doesn't matter
where you start.
Anything is possible.
When I come out and talk
to these kids,
I see in their eyes they want to
accomplish things in their life.
And if I can just give them
a little bit of motivation,
that's a huge win.
The key is finding something
you really like to do
and then being great at it.
Patel: The year before
"Shark Tank,"
I did just $600,000 in sales.
Just six months
after making my deal,
I've done $4 million in sales.
Prep Expert is on track
to become one of
the largest test?prep providers
in the nation.
Thank you, everybody.
My goal as a Shark
is to go out there
and help as many kids as I can
to accomplish their dreams
by helping them start
businesses.
That's what "Shark Tank"
is all about.
That's what the American dream
is all about.
Patel: My parents came to
this country with nothing,
and they built their own
American dream.
When my dad looks at me now,
I can tell I'm his American
dream come true.
Narrator:
Next up is a way to send
a little love and comfort
to your loved ones.
