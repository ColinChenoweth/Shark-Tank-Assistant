Hi, Sharks.
I'm Phil Petracca.
Philip:
This is a challenge, Mark.
The great thing
about our company
is we're creating
a category.
The challenge with our company
is we're creating a category.
?Right.
?Mark, do you have an offer?
Cuban: I'm trying to find out,
you know,
if it seems too good to be true.
Corcoran: It's always too good
to be true.
I'm wildly enthusiastic
about the product,
but I'm not wildly enthusiastic
about you.
I feel like you're <i>too</i> slick.
You have <i>every</i> answer.
Narrator: All six Sharks
are still in.
Phil, the main reason that
I started to do this show
Phil, Phil, I'm just gonna
let everybody ??
Wait, wait, wait,
I want to see.
?Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil,
Phil, Phil, Phil!
?This is our next?generation ??
?Yes, sir?
?I'm out.
?Okay.
?Why'd you do that?
?Okay.
?Just let him go, Phil.
?Go, Phil.
?I'm not out.
?Wait, Phil. Phil.
?I'm still in, Phil.
He's out.
You got five more to go.
?I'm interested.
?We worked really hard
to be here.
Can you please show me
what that is?
Phil, the great thing for you
is I have QVC
Phil, just so you know,
this is a fact ??
the number?one provider of wine
on QVC is me.
Where do you want to go that you
can't get to right now?
Yeah, we want to be in Bed Bath
&amp; Beyond with that product.
Whoa! That's where I have
a huge relationship.
I think at $99 at Bed Bath
&amp; Beyond, they have ??
Cuban: Okay,
that makes more sense.
You know I have
a great relationship
with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.
Hello, Phil?
?Phil, Phil, Phil?
?Tabletop type thing.
?Phil?
?What are you doing there?
So, we've had
some discussions.
?Yes.
?Phil, you have three offers.
What are you gonna do,
Mark?
Okay, so, I'm gonna make
an offer.
