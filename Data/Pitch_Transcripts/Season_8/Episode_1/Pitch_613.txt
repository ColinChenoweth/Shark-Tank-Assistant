Hi, I'm Marti Wymer.
And I'm Scott Gustafson.
Our company is
Spoonful of Comfort.
And we are seeking $400,000
in growth capital
in exchange for 10%
of our business.
When someone you love
is sick or hurting,
whether it's family
or friend,
it's human nature
to want to be there,
do something
to help them feel better.
Unfortunately,
in today's world,
when loved ones
often live far away,
many of us feel helpless.
Traditionally,
the only options
have been to send flowers,
fruit, or candy.
However, we all know that the
best cure for what ails you
is the comfort of good,
old?fashioned chicken soup.
But getting that soup
all the way
across the country
always ?? isn't always easy.
Here comes Spoonful of Comfort
to the rescue.
A care package ordered
from our website
delivers a ready?to?go meal
right to the doorstep.
Each gift includes
a generous family?sized jar
of hand?crafted soup,
a half dozen bakery rolls
and cookies
all beautifully packaged
and guaranteed to make them
and you feel better.
All of this at a cost
equal to or less
than a bouquet of flowers.
So when you
can't mail a hug,
Spoonful of Comfort
is the next best thing.
So, who wants a taste of this
growing gourmet soup business?
?I do.
?I love soup.
?I hope you're hungry!
?All right, we've got samples.
Bring it on.
You know, there are six Sharks
up here now.
Marti: Yeah.
Yeah, we do.
I hope you have enough
for six.
Scott: We did actually
get six, so...
Nervous, shaky hands
to hand you soup.
?Thank you very much.
?Thank you very much.
?Got it?
?Oh, there's two kinds of soup.
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, wow.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
Greiner:
I tried the tomato first,
and it's excellent.
?Don't spill it.
?It's good.
Wow, you know, both of these
soups are great.
?This <i>is</i> good.
?Mmm!
?Mmm!
?It's delicious.
How much do you sell
a package for,
and what's your cost on it?
Marti: We sell a package
for $69.99.
?With two soups?
?$69.99?!
?Oh, that's a lot of soup.
?Wait a minute.
However, that feeds a family.
?Oh, there you go. Okay.
?So, you get that jar.
Oh, there you go.
Marti:
So, you get this jar,
a half dozen rolls in this box,
six cookies in this box.
What does it cost to ship?
$69.99 ?? Is that inclusive
of shipping?
?Right.
?Or is shipping added on top?
Marti: So, no, it does not.
So, we have a standard shipping
of $14.99.
?Ouch!
?That's actually
a really good ??
Hang on.
I can buy soup for somebody
or put them through college.
My choice.

So, tell us a little bit about
the business. Tell us more.
Well, the idea for the business
came about October of 2007
when I got that
dreaded phone call.
[ Voice breaking ] My
mother had been diagnosed
with lung cancer,
and the worst part
about hearing the news
is she was living
thousands of miles away.
And I just felt helpless
being so far away.
So I jumped online
to send her something,
and tons of options,
like we said ??
flowers, candy, fruit ??
but, like, nothing just
felt appropriate
for that situation.
And so I immediately thought
of chicken soup.
It's what she,
like many mothers,
used to make
to comfort me.
But I couldn't find
any to send.
So, tragically, I lost her
just six weeks later.
Out of that tragedy,
this idea for Spoonful
of Comfort came about,
and so I thought,
"What better way to honor her
than to help other people
in the same situation?"
Scott, how did you get involved
with the business?
I came out of
business school
and went to work for a big
pharmaceutical company.
Steve, her husband, was
our Vice President of Sales.
How much did you put in?
So, I ?? Initially,
I put in $500,000.
?Wow.
?$500,000!
KH: How much do
you own of this business?
?60%.
?He said "initially."
Where are you at totally
in your commitment of cash
to this business?
So, I have loaned in another
approximately $800,000.
$1.3 million?
Start at the beginning.
?I'll start back a few years.
?Make it good.
It's a lot of money.
When we launched this,
we partnered with a group
that was a national ??
It was a national
daily deal site.
Okay, so you're giving away
the product for less.
So, what we did was we got
into an arrangement with them,
and the popularity of our deal
just took off.
?Uh?oh.
?But you made no money.
So you were losing money
on every deal.
?Yes.
?And you were funding it.
And we were calling it the cost
of customer acquisition.
What does it cost you to acquire
the incremental customer now?
Forget about the coupon stuff.
?Sure.
?$18.
?$18.
O'Leary: What price were you
selling it for?
?For $35.
?Ooh.
?And what's your cost?
?So all of your margin was gone.
?Yeah.
?And our costs are $31.
Did the customers
ever order again?
That was the problem.
?[ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
What are your sales?
The most recent 12 months,
we're at $1.08 million.
Okay, that's not horrible.
Corcoran: Here's what I think
is an Achilles heel
in your operation ??
When I send that out
and someone is sick,
I want them getting it <i>then.</i>
?Sure.
I don't want them receiving it
two, three days hence.
?Yeah.
Have you not had any issue
with that?
O'Leary:
How much does that cost?
Overnight, what does that cost?
$39.99.
I believe that this is a
business that's going to fail.
The business isn't fancy enough
to support everything
you're doing.
The idea that you put
$1.3 million?plus
into this business
blows my mind.
Too complicated.
It's nutty.
It'll never, never work.
I want to be a Kevin on this one
and tell you to go out
in the back and shoot it.
I'm out.
And I suggest you go out, too.
I don't think it's a
take?it?out?behind?the?barn
and?shoot?it, right?
You're not
in the food business.
You're not in the comfort
business.
You're in the marketing
business.
But to be in
the marketing business,
you have to be good
at marketing.
You're trying to be dependent
on us to fix that for you,
and to me, that's a bad
combination.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
John:
I like this actual concept.
The biggest challenge
I'm having with it
is you have to find people
when they have a cold,
and I just don't see it growing
out of that at the moment,
especially with
a very high valuation.
So unfortunately, I'm out.
Really liked the tomato soup,
but I don't like this model.
It's a convenience.
It's cute.
The rolls, the cookies ??
They're all good.
There's nothing wrong with it.
But to me, for this
to become really big,
I don't see that happening.
I see it maybe being something
that can sustain the two of you,
but as an investor,
I couldn't see me getting
my money out of this.
So for that reason, I'm out.
?Okay, thank you.
?Thank you.
I like the business.
I mean, it's a great idea.
Nobody loves soup
more than I do.
[ Chuckles ]
Herjavec:
But you know, you've been doing
it for five years now.
You haven't figured out
the kinks.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Thanks.
O'Leary: Today is your lucky day
because there's six Sharks.
So you're not dead yet.
Every Shark here have,
over the years,
invested in businesses that have
to acquire customers
and ship food goods to them.
?Yep.
?Yes.
O'Leary: And what we've learned
over time
is that the customer acquisition
cost is the whole deal.
?Right.
?Whole deal.
Your acquisition costs,
you said earlier, was $18.
Right.
So basically, you have to give
up 40% of your margin,
but it still works.
It's just that
it's a long grind.
I don't know how to help you
reduce your customer
acquisition costs.
I'm out.
We thank you for taking
the time with us.
?Thank you.
?Great. Thanks, guys.
Good luck.
?Thank you.
Thanks, guys. Thank you.
?Good luck.
Marti: [ Voice breaking ] Even
though we didn't get a deal,
I know that my mom
would be proud.
You know, when you're trying
to build this legacy
in the name of your mother,
I just want to make it work.
Narrator: Next into the tank
is a way
to show off your personality
with every step you take.
