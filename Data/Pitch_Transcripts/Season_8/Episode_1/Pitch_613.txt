Hey, Sharks, my name
is Justin Kittredge
from Boston, Massachusetts.
Justin Bieber, D. J. Khaled,
Thank you, Justin.
?You're welcome.
?Which ones are for Lori?
O'Leary: Thank you, Justin.
Right here.
?You're welcome.
?Thank you.
Corcoran: Thank you, Justin.
Greiner:
Oh, look what I got.
?Oh, cool.
?It is Queen.
?This is Cash Flow.
?Thank you, sir.
?You got it.
?Cash Flow. Very nice.
Car racing. Very nice.
?Oh, little Mavi Slides.
?All right!
Corcoran:
I really like yours.
Barbara, I like the color
of yours.
John: That's neat.
But it's got my name on it,
so you can't have it.
Greiner:
Those are cute.
This does warm my heart,
I must say.
?I would hope so.
?[ Chuckles ]
I wear flip?flops
almost every day
when I don't have
to wear a suit.
These are the most comfortable
ones I've had in a long time.
Awesome.
But, Justin,
how do you sell them?
O'Leary: And I'm gonna make
a prediction, Justin ??
You are not gonna get
a $10 million valuation
for this commodity.
?And you'll customize?
?Justin, can I design it
for myself,
pick the color, the flower
on it, et cetera?
?100%.
?Exactly.
?Yeah, exactly.
?How long?
Justin, how did you get
to a $10 million valuation?
Narrator:
All six Sharks are in,
but they question
the high valuation
that Justin has placed
on his customizable
slide company ISlide.
Justin, how did you get
to a $10 million valuation?
I'm really struggling with
the $10 million valuation.
?Who is that guy?
?Who's that?
?There's a guy behind you.
?Yo, Justin!
?[ Laughs ]
?You started without me.
Sorry, buddy.
How you doing?
What's up, Steeler Nation?!
Antonio Brown!
?What's happening?
?How you guys doing?
How are your slides?
?Boomin'.
?Boomin'!
The L. A. traffic got me
a little slow,
but I'm excited
to be here today.
You left your guy
hanging, huh?
So, as I mentioned
in the opening pitch,
the best wide receiver
in the NFL, Antonio Brown ??
?Thank you very much.
?Justin, I think ??
Antonio sold a lot of ISlides,
so, power to you.
But you want to build
a shoe company.
?100%.
?To get to that,
you got to start doing the
mass?appeal type of licenses.
I've negotiated those ??
Disney, DreamWorks licenses ??
once?in?a?lifetime
kind of deals.
I'll give you the $500,000.
I'll give it to you for 20%.
?Thank you very much.
?Wow.
You mind if I hear out
the rest of the Sharks?
Well, I'll help out here.
I'm out.
I appreciate that.
Let me just tell you about me
for one minute.
?I don't need to.
?I don't need to hear about you.
?Does anybody else?
?You know what,
there's talking time...
I know enough about you.
Justin, you're asking us to pay
today for tomorrow's value.
It's just nutsy.
You're too optimistic.
I'm out.
Justin, I respect
what you've accomplished.
I do. The customization,
the fact that you're hustling.
You're lining up people
to grow the business.
You've got great reps like
Antonio boomin' it out, right?
But it's not a business for me.
It's not investable for me.
So I'm out.
John:
This valuation here ??
You're worth no more
than $500,000,
No. No way. Justin, I was ??
I was giving you
a future value because of
your operation expertise.
Robert, you were insane
for that valuation.
?That's insane.
?It's optimistic.
$500,000, 20%.
I'm ?? I'm done at that number.
Final offer, Justin.
Um...
I just can't thank you enough
for the offer, Robert.
I can't believe
I'm watching this.
Justin: I can't believe
I turned down $500,000,
but at the same time,
I till left money on the table
but I didn't leave them down.
I just ?? All I go to right now
is how hard...
[ Sighs ]
I haven't cried in like
[bleep] 10 years.
[Bleep]
