My name is Trisha Prabhu.
I'm 16 years old, and I'm from
Naperville, Illinois.
I'm an ambitious person,
and I love aiming
for number one.
I started coding
when I was 10 years old.
Very quickly, I learned
that it was something
I was really passionate about.
I've been invited
to the White House.
I was named a Google Science
Fair Global Finalist.
My work has been recognized
by M. I. T.,
and I've even given
three T. E. D. talks.
Today we are going to be
learning about variables.
I wanted to give back
to my community
and inspire young girls,
so I started teaching
Girls Who Code classes.
I definitely believe in the
concept of technology for good.
My business centers around
one of the biggest problems
facing kids and teens today,
and I'm using technology
to solve an issue
that many people believe
technology has created.
It's been a very tough road.
As a 16?year?old,
there are a lot of skeptics
that don't take me seriously,
that don't take
my product seriously.
A lot of people don't see me
as the Silicon Valley
tech stereotype.
But that means I need
to break that barrier.
That's something that I'm proud
to be doing.
I truly believe that
this business is my future,
and with the Sharks, we can see
that future become a reality.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Trisha Prabhu,
and I'm from Naperville,
Illinois.
I'm the creator of ReThink,
and today I'm here
seeking $100,000
in exchange for a 20%
equity stake in ReThink.
Now, we all know the Tank
has seen
its share of harsh comments.
No!
"You're a cockroach."
So true sometimes.
"You're a zero, not a hero.
You're not an entrepreneur.
You're a want?trepreneur."
And, of course,
"You're dead to me."
Now, if you think
the Tank is bad,
the Internet is so much worse.
Cyber bullies hide
behind their screens
and use mean, tormenting,
and humiliating words every day
to bully others.
It's a silent pandemic
that affects millions.
But I'm determined to stop this.
ReThink stops cyber bullying
by stopping hurtful messages
before the damage is done.
If an adolescent tries to post
something offensive
on social media
or text someone a cruel message,
my ReThink app
is able to detect
that that message is offensive
and then provide the adolescent
a second chance to
reconsider their decision.
Here's how it works.
This is an example
of a typical conversation
between two classmates.
Ooh!
Looks like Joey wants to ask
Erica to the homecoming dance.
?Ooh.
?Let's see what she says.
?[ Laughing ] Oh, gosh.
?Ouch!
There's no need to say
something like that.
Luckily, with my app,
Erica can rethink her decision.
Much better.
By taking an extra second to
pause, review, and rethink,
Erica ultimately makes
the better decision.
And will you look at that?
They both walk away
with no hard feelings.
I don't think
he's gonna stop asking.
[ Chuckles ]
ReThink was able to stop
the damage before it was done.
In this era of
digital parenting,
ReThink also provides parents
an opportunity
to help shape
their child's behavior
by encouraging positive decision
making both online and offline.
Do you want to sit back and
wonder at what could have been?
Or do you want to stand up,
speak out,
and join me to stop
cyber bullying forever?
Thank you.
So, Erica, she gets that pop?up
message comes up...
?Correct.
?ReThink.
What if she just hits, "OK"?
Can she still send it?
?Absolutely.
So, we're not taking away
anyone's right
to express any of their feelings
or opinions.
They can still post that message
if they like.
So you're simply giving them
that extra time to rethink.
But did Erica have to sign up
for your app?
Trisha: So, that's a really
great question.
Why would cyber bullies
download ReThink?
That's why we target two main
groups ?? educators and parents.
Those are the people that are
looking right now
for solutions to cyber bullying.
I'm just very curious why
you would think of this
in the first place.
Tell us a little bit about
your own background.
Well, I'm actually a 16?year?old
high?school junior.
And when I was 13 years old,
I actually came home from school
one day to read online
about an 11?year?old girl
who lost her life
to cyber bullying.
She had been cyber?bullied
for over a year and a half,
and it just ??
it really broke my heart
to think that someone younger
than myself
had suffered endlessly
because of an issue
that didn't have
a better solution.
And immediately, I wanted to be
able to make a difference.
I wanted to use technology
to solve a problem
that technology itself
has created.
I cannot believe you're 16.
?Yeah, you carry yourself
very well.
?You're so powerful.
?Thank you.
?Trisha, have you sold any?
So, so far, we've garnered
about $52,000
from the We Think ReThink
Educational Program.
Schools everywhere, because of
new state and federal laws,
are required to monitor
and supervise
anti?cyber?bullying
education in schools.
So what we do is we actually
provide them curriculum.
We provide them
this ReThink technology
on their school devices.
We provide them
ReThink analytics
on how the technology
is working with students.
We've gotten 128,000 downloads
on both our Google Play Store
and the App Store.
?Through what period of time?
?That's nine months.
Herjavec: The amount
of downloads you've had
is very impressive
for nine months.
Thank you.
It's a good idea,
but there's some challenges
to it.
And the challenge to it is
that the user is in control
of the experience.
In other words,
if I'm really a cyber bully,
all I have to do is hit "OK,"
and the message
still goes through.
Trisha: When I first came up
with this idea,
I had the same doubts
that you did.
"What if they just hit 'no'
every time?"
So I ended up conducting
a 1,500?trial study,
and we find that over 93%
of the time,
when teenagers get
this ReThink alert,
they change their mind.
Cuban: So, let's get the proof
in the pudding, right?
What's your daily active usage?
So, every day,
we have about 80,000 ??
Who wrote all the code for it?
So, I've actually been coding
since I was 10.
?Wow.
?Something I love to do.
?You coded this?
?Yes.
What a tremendous
entrepreneurial talent.
Thank you.
I think you have a decision
to make.
I think you have to decide
if this is a charity
or if this is a business.
I think what you have to do here
is decide that this is a charity
and try to get money to support
the charity
because it's certainly
a worthy cause
and easy to convince everybody
else to believe in.
But I really think when you want
to start a business
that makes money,
it's got to be something
totally different.
I think you're doing
the right thing, but I'm out.
Thank you so much, Barbara.
So, obviously,
everybody agrees
you're remarkably talented
for 16.
That's fantastic.
?Thank you.
You're destined to do
something great.
I don't know what it is yet.
You're gonna find out.
But it's not this.
This is not going
to make you rich.
Taking on an investor means you
have a new responsibility.
You have to make them money.
And I am 100% committed
to that.
I have never been afraid
of hard work.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
So, I think
it's a fantastic cause.
You, at 16,
are incredibly talented.
But content?filtering software's
been around
for a very long time.
?Sure.
?This really isn't that unique.
Trying to sell it this way
for people to download this
as an application ??
it's gonna be a struggle.
I don't see it
as a business today.
I'm out.
I wish you all the best of luck.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
What are you gonna use
the money for?
So, the $100,000 would be used
to hire employees
to start building infrastructure
so that we can roll this out
to the large scale of interest
that we have.
The resources I have ??
?The large scale of interest?
Like what?
I have 1,200 schools
that are interested
in having this
for the upcoming 2016?2017
school year,
and T?Mobile Europe,
the phone carrier,
was interested in actually
implementing this.
I decided I wanted this to be
more than just one carrier
just for one region
of the world.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You had a carrier contact you?
?I did.
?And you said no?
?And you said no?
Trisha: I turned it down
because at that point,
it was a very early stage.
It was just at the point
when we had launched the app.
We were getting thousands
and thousands of downloads.
I genuinely believe that this
can be something more
than just one carrier,
and I think
that we can get there.
John: All right, so, I think
there is a business here.
I'm not ??
This is not about charity.
I want to be a part of this.
I like the cause.
I like the concept.
I'll give you the $100,000
for 30%.
This happens to be
a passion of mine
because I think
it's super?important.
I love the kind of woman
that when her feet hit
the ground in the morning,
the competition's like,
"Oh, crap. She's up."
You're that woman.
I'm gonna offer you $100,000.
I'm gonna do it for the 20%.
And I honestly wouldn't
even mind doing it
with another Shark here
because I think the more people
that are involved in it,
the better to get the word out.
Cuban's not out.
Mark's not out.
?But, Mark, you're still in.
?Right.
If you want to get this
into as ubiquitous a position
as possible,
working with a carrier is
by far, without any question,
the best way to go.
Absolutely.
The reason for that is
they can put it on a phone
as a default option.
It can come pre?installed.
They can, then, offer it
to consumers, to parents ??
"This is
a kid?friendly phone,"
or, "We sell
a kid?friendly version."
Is that a viable option
to you?
Something that
I would be open to,
and with your guidance,
with your expertise,
I can make those decisions.
John:
What do you got, Mark?
Here's my offer ??
I'll go in with Lori.
You know, we can split it.
All right, so,
Mark is in with Lori.
$100,000 for 20%.
$50,000 from each.
Damon's $100,000 for 30%.
Time to make a decision.
Mark and Lori,
I'm gonna accept your offer.
?All right, great.
?Thank you both so much.
Greiner: Great.
Congratulations.
It'll be exciting
to work with you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
?I'm really glad.
?Thank you.
This is a passion of mine.
Thank you so much.
We're gonna do
a lot with it.
?Awesome.
?A lot with it.
Thank you guys so much.
Thank you all so much
for your time.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Honestly, it's just shock waves
right now.
I can't believe
I just made a deal
with Mark Cuban
and Lori Greiner.
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you!
Good job!
I'm so proud of you!
Love you so much!
I think that, you know, the
three of us working together ??
I mean, we can make ReThink a
multi?million?dollar success,
and I really believe with them
it is possible.
