Hey, Sharks, my name
is Justin Kittredge
from Boston, Massachusetts.
I am founder and CEO of ISlide.
Today I'm seeking $500,000
in exchange for 5% equity
of my company.
ISlide is the only premium
customizable slide
in the industry.
Our motto is,
"Stand in what you stand for,"
'cause our product is an
extension of self?expression.
We work with teens, brands,
corporations,
and even individuals.
Because of our amazing comfort
and personalization,
high school, college,
and pro teams
of all sports all buy from us.
Celebrities like LeBron James,
Justin Bieber, D. J. Khaled,
and even Madonna
are all rocking ISlides.
And if that's not good enough,
how about the best wide receiver
in the NFL,
Antonio Brown of
the Pittsburgh Steelers?
?Go, Steelers.
?Don't believe me?
Ask him yourself one day.
So, Sharks, it's taken me
three years to get here.
ISlide is the only company
in the world
that allows you to stand in
what you stand for.
I'd like to pass out
some personalized gifts.
Thank you, Justin.
?You're welcome.
?Which ones are for Lori?
I have to hand them to her.
O'Leary: Thank you, Justin.
Right here.
?You're welcome.
?Thank you.
Corcoran: Thank you, Justin.
Greiner:
Oh, look what I got.
?Oh, cool.
?It is Queen.
?This is Cash Flow.
?Thank you, sir.
?You got it.
?Cash Flow. Very nice.
Car racing. Very nice.
?Oh, little Mavi Slides.
?All right!
Corcoran:
I really like yours.
Barbara, I like the color
of yours.
John: That's neat.
But it's got my name on it,
so you can't have it.
Greiner:
Those are cute.
This does warm my heart,
I must say.
?I would hope so.
?[ Chuckles ]
I wear flip?flops
almost every day
when I don't have
to wear a suit.
These are the most comfortable
ones I've had in a long time.
Awesome.
O'Leary: I want to understand
your business model
because you're valuing
this company at ??
I can give you $500,000 at 5%.
That's a $10 million valuation.
Yes.
So I'm gonna make the assumption
you've got sales.
So why don't you jump
right into it?
And before you answer that,
did you work at Reebok?
?I was.
?That's why you're up in Boston?
?Yes.
?Okay.
That makes you
even more credible,
but can you tell us what
your sales are gonna be?
Sure. No problem.
So, we've been in business
for just under three years.
We've done $1.5 million
in sales.
So, I got to tell you
right now ??
Warning, Red Leader, warning ??
because that is
10 times revenue.
That's a really big problem.
But, Justin,
how do you sell them?
O'Leary: And I'm gonna make
a prediction, Justin ??
You are not gonna get
a $10 million valuation
for this commodity.
Could we, perhaps,
understand a little more?
How do you sell them?
?Absolutely.
So, we have four
distribution channels.
The first one is individuals.
So anyone can come on our site,
individually want ??
?One at a time.
?One at a time.
?And what do you sell them for?
?$50.
?And you'll customize?
?Justin, can I design it
for myself,
pick the color, the flower
on it, et cetera?
?100%.
?Exactly.
?Yeah, exactly.
?How long?
?And you wait how long
to get it?
?We'll ship it under a week.
?Nice.
?Okay, how much does it cost
you to make a ship?
About $15.
The customer pays
for the shipping?
And what percentage of
your sales are that way?
?That's pretty good.
?About 15%.
?Oh, small.
?Yeah. 15%.
Where's the bulk
of your sales?
With team and drop?ship.
When you say "drop?ship,"
what do you mean by that?
Who are you drop?shipping to?
Our biggest partner
in our drop?ship model
is with D. J. Khaled.
He does all these different
sayings that he comes up with.
We put them on the Slides.
He sells them.
Every day we get orders
from him,
and we fulfill them
and direct?ship
right to the customer.
Got it.
We thought he was gonna do
about 20 to 30 pairs
in the first week or two.
He did over 800
in the first day.
John: But you're using
your valuation
because of an influencer, right?
D. J. Khaled is one part
of our business.
We have multiple pieces
of our business
that are only increasing
every day.
O'Leary: Including all your
costs and your own salary,
what do you bring pre?tax?
About $75,000 net profit.
O'Leary: Yikes.
This is ridiculous!
How do you get to $10 million?
When we do $2.7 million in sales
for the next 12 months,
it's really just over
three times revenue multiple,
which in our industry,
is pretty fair.
No, no, no, but your profit ??
your profit multiple is 30x
on a shoe company.
But not even a shoe company.
Kind of a promo company.
Justin, how did you get
to a $10 million valuation?
Narrator:
All six Sharks are in,
but they question
the high valuation
that Justin has placed
on his customizable
slide company ISlide.
Justin, how did you get
to a $10 million valuation?
I'm really struggling with
the $10 million valuation.
?Who is that guy?
?Who's that?
?There's a guy behind you.
?Yo, Justin!
?[ Laughs ]
?You started without me.
Sorry, buddy.
How you doing?
What's up, Steeler Nation?!
Antonio Brown!
?What's happening?
?How you guys doing?
How are your slides?
?Boomin'.
?Boomin'!
The L. A. traffic got me
a little slow,
but I'm excited
to be here today.
You left your guy
hanging, huh?
So, as I mentioned
in the opening pitch,
the best wide receiver
in the NFL, Antonio Brown ??
he made it, and, listen,
Antonio's been a friend
for a while.
I mean, he can tell you
a little bit about,
you know,
why he loves ISlide.
Yes.
One reason I love ISlide ??
because you could customize it
to your motivation.
So I put "Boomin'" on my Slides.
But you could make
your slides custom
to what your belief is
or whatever drives you.
Antonio, are you selling them
from your site?
I have. I have sold 400 slippers
in 24 hours.
?Wow.
?Yeah.
John: I believe that it's really
good for Antonio.
That's why I'm attracted
to this.
But why does this make <i>you</i>
worth $10 million?
I know the valuation, you know,
is coming up a lot.
?Coming up a lot?
?No, I get it.
But, you know,
you've once said
that you've seen a future trend
is mass customization
an individual scale, right?
Greiner: Personalization
is great and super?popular.
So you grabbed onto that,
and you're running.
The problem for me is,
besides that you do have
a crazy valuation,
is that there's nothing
to prevent anybody else
from doing this.
For that reason, I'm out.
?Thank you very much.
?Justin, I think ??
Antonio sold a lot of ISlides,
so, power to you.
But you want to build
a shoe company.
?100%.
?To get to that,
you got to start doing the
mass?appeal type of licenses.
I've negotiated those ??
Disney, DreamWorks licenses ??
once?in?a?lifetime
kind of deals.
I'll give you the $500,000.
I'll give it to you for 20%.
?Thank you very much.
?Wow.
You mind if I hear out
the rest of the Sharks?
Well, I'll help out here.
I'm out.
I appreciate that.
Let me just tell you about me
for one minute.
?I don't need to.
?I don't need to hear about you.
?Does anybody else?
?You know what,
there's talking time...
I know enough about you.
... and then
there's selling time
and then there's
closing time.
I would take that deal
in two seconds.
You're on the 1?yard line.
You're on the 1 yard line.
Justin, you're asking us to pay
today for tomorrow's value.
It's just nutsy.
You're too optimistic.
I'm out.
I understand.
Thank you.
In 2004 ??
?Stop selling.
?Wait, wait, wait, wait.
?Stop selling.
?In 20??
O'Leary: It would be useful
for you to know
if anybody else is interested.
So, Daymond,
are you still in?
?I'm still in.
?I understand.
?Mark, are you still in?
?In 2004, I got laid off from ??
?Here we go.
?I got laid off from Reebok.
I thought it was the most
devastating day of my life.
I thought I was gonna be there
for my entire life,
not even a question.
It was absolutely devastating.
From that moment on,
I knew I want to start
my own business.
I knew I was never gonna put
myself at risk.
We're gonna make it.
There's no question about it.
Daymond, in six months, we went
from concept to market ??
opening up molds, getting
inventory, wear?testing,
everything.
We're able to have guys
like this who believe in it,
who are the most elite athletes
in the world.
Justin, I respect
what you've accomplished.
I do. The customization,
the fact that you're hustling.
You're lining up people
to grow the business.
You've got great reps like
Antonio boomin' it out, right?
But it's not a business for me.
It's not investable for me.
So I'm out.
John:
This valuation here ??
You're worth no more
than $500,000,
and you're out of your mind
for not taking his offer.
And just for that reason,
I'm out.
And now that offer's
gonna cost you more.
You're crazy. 25 times cash flow
for a tchotchke company.
Are you out of your mind?
?How did you get 25 times?
You can buy these in China.
He's only gonna make $100,000
next year after tax.
And they'll give you
all you want.
You're paying $2.5 million.
Are you out of your mind?
?[ Laughs ]
O'Leary: Robert, I can't watch
you kill money that way.
Children are gonna watch this.
You know, Kevin,
that's the beauty ??
They're gonna watch you
kill money.
That's the beauty
of the show.
You're murdering money
in front of children.
And so, Robert, I know
you're not countering,
but I'm gonna counter you anyway
at $500,000 for 10%.
If there's any way
you would do it,
I would do a deal right now.
?That's insane.
No. No way. Justin, I was ??
I was giving you
a future value because of
your operation expertise.
Robert, you were insane
for that valuation.
?That's insane.
?It's optimistic.
$500,000, 20%.
I'm ?? I'm done at that number.
Final offer, Justin.
Um...
I just can't thank you enough
for the offer, Robert.
I can't believe
I'm watching this.
I cannot, and I'm truly sorry.
[ Laughs ]
But I do want to say
thank you very much.
But I'm gonna have to decline.
Remember the cartoon
where the guy turns into,
like ?? to
the all?day sucker?
?I think you're making
a mistake.
?That's Robert right now.
You don't know the stuff
you don't know.
But good luck.
Cuban: Hey, he's willing
to grind it out.
?Thank you, guys.
?Good luck.
Corcoran:
Thanks for the shoes.
?Thank you, man.
?Good to see you again, Antonio.
By the way, you just witnessed
insanity in the Tank.
I'll take the $500,000.
[ Laughter ]
Justin: I can't believe
I turned down $500,000,
but at the same time,
I till left money on the table
but I didn't leave them down.
I just ?? All I go to right now
is how hard...
[ Sighs ]
I haven't cried in like
[bleep] 10 years.
[Bleep]
