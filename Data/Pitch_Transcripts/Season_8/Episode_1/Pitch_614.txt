Hi, Sharks.
My name is Trisha Prabhu,
Trisha: So, that's a really
great question.
Why would cyber bullies
download ReThink?
?Thank you.
?Trisha, have you sold any?
So, so far, we've garnered
about $52,000
from the We Think ReThink
Educational Program.
Trisha: When I first came up
with this idea,
I had the same doubts
that you did.
"What if they just hit 'no'
every time?"
So I ended up conducting
a 1,500?trial study,
Trisha: I turned it down
because at that point,
it was a very early stage.
It was just at the point
when we had launched the app.
