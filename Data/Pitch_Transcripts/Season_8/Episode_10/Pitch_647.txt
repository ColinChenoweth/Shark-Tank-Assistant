and self?made
billionaire investor Chris Sacca
joins the tank.
This is the highest valuation
we've ever had on "Shark Tank."
We've never had any company
for $40 million.
It scares the hell
out of me.
You've got the most valuable
prime time airtime in the world
right now,
and you're blowing it.
Oh, I ?? No disrespect.
Herjavec: Regardless of
what Chris Sacca thinks,
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Ryan Evans.
I'm Dave Evans.
And I'm Chris Haley.
We're from Santa Cruz,
California,
and our company is
Inboard Technology.
We are seeking $750,000
in exchange
for a 4% equity stake
in our company.
[ Chuckles ]
Sharks, let's face it.
Getting around urban areas ??
It sucks!
Jam?packed in
a crowded public transportation
or stuck in gridlock
on your drive home,
and just when you think you've
beaten the system
by riding a bike to work,
you show up looking like
a hot, sweaty mess.
Our solution is the M1.
The M1 is
an electric skateboard
that goes
up to 20 miles an hour
and has a range
of 7 to 10 miles.
We've integrated headlights
and taillights
so you're safe
when you ride at night.
Our in?wheel
motor technology...
[ Motor whirs ]
... has no moving belts,
no gears,
and requires no maintenance.
All this while looking and
feeling like a real skateboard.
At 14 pounds,
you can easily carry the M1
into a crowded elevator,
and I think
we can all agree
that parking is not
gonna be a problem.
Sharks, we're on the verge
of a transportation revolution.
Riding the M1 can turn
your commute into a fun, easy,
and exciting experience,
and all for less than the cost
of car insurance.
Now, which one
of you Sharks
wants to get onboard
with Inboard?
And more importantly, who wants
to come up and try the M1?
O'Leary:
I want to try that thing.
I'll give it a shot.
Kevin, here we go.
All right.
So it's really easy
to use.
All right.
The big thing is that
you've got
four contact points
with the ground.
Yeah.
So, it's really stable.
Will it support
Kevin's weight?
[ Laughter ]
We've actually tested it up to
1,200 pounds ?? very strong.
This is the safety.
So, you hold this to engage.
It's just forward to go forward
and back to go back.
So, I can't move it
unless I'm pushing this, right?
Exactly.
There we go.
Herjavec: You might want to hold
Kevin's hand at the beginning.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.
Ryan: There you go.
And pull back to brake.
Very cool.
Yeah, and he's gone.
See you later,
kiddies.
Ryan:
Oh, there he goes.
Sacca: He shreds.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Oh, yeah, baby.
Okay, I like it.
I like it.
Yeah.
It's very cool.
Looking very good, Kevin.
There you go.
That's 'cause I'm very hip.
That's it.
Yeah.
I'm a skater dude.
I'm pretty sure there's other
electric skateboards out there.
Ryan:
Yeah, that's correct.
Why is yours unique?
The fact that we created
the first ever in?wheel motor.
It's actually
one of the smallest
hub motors ever created.
The way we integrated
the battery into the deck.
But, really,
the biggest difference
between us
and our competitors
is the way
that we designed our company.
From inception,
we've focused on scalability,
high?volume manufacturing,
and high?volume distribution.
Cuban:
How much have you raised?
To date,
it's been $2.7 million.
Greiner: Wow.
What was the value of the
company after your last round?
We had a $10 million valuation
after our last round.
So, did you say
it can go uphill?
Yes.
And going downhill,
what happens?
It actually ?? It brakes,
and it charges the battery
while you brake.
The greatest thing about
the in?wheel motor technology ??
If you look at any of
our competitors on the market,
they all use an external motor
that sits outside
and then ultimately,
a gear and a belt system
that drives the motor.
But, Ryan,
it's a skateboard.
Yes.
It's a toy.
Haley:
We would disagree with that.
A lot of people see that
as their vehicle.
Really?
Cuban:
But that's a niche market.
Nobody is gonna commute to work
with a skateboard
that isn't commuting to work
with a skateboard today.
Man, sometimes,
you sound really old.
This is happening today
at scale.
Really?
Yeah, maybe not in Toronto
because you have to
dig out of snow half the year,
but here in California,
it's happening at scale.
I actually do see them
as a vehicle or as a tool.
Yeah, but when Chris
talks about scale, he's wrong.
Just because you see individuals
driving around on skateboards
doesn't mean it's scale.
One of my companies
is working on re?inventing
the self?balancing
"Hoverboards," right?
Mm?hmm.
There's challenges
there, right?
Absolutely.
There's laws in terms of riding
on the sidewalks.
There's inclines.
There's bumps in the road.
You're absolutely right.
And so, we've got some IP
currently pending on some new
form factors and designs
that'll blow you away.
I just want to know ??
What does it cost?
The retail price
is $1,399.
And what does it cost
to make?
We have have
a direct margin of 65%.
How many people
can afford $1,400?
The self?balancing boards,
when they first came out,
were 1,500 bucks, and they ??
they sold hundreds of thousands.
Ryan: Yeah.
So, people want
a better way.
Wait, didn't you just tell me
that I'm wrong about scale,
that this isn't
gonna scale?
It's a whole
different beast.
The skateboard market
is completely different
than the Hoverboard
'cause one is a lot easier
to balance on.
It's a lot easier to go forward
and backwards.
You don't hang out
on YouTube enough
to see all the Hoverboard
fail videos, man.
No, you're wrong there.
Because not only have I seen
all the YouTube videos,
I've read the patents,
so I know what's going on.
They're
two different markets.
One is to get around
your neighborhood, have fun.
They weren't really definitive
modes of transportation
to go to work.
I see that market.
Right.
For sure.
So, that's why
they sold more.
This, in terms of being a way
to get to work ??
I don't think
it's big enough right now
for you to say you're gonna
change how people go to work.
Haley:
'When I lived in Manhattan,
I basically planned my life
around traffic.
The M1 ?? It's very easy
to pick up and take in a subway,
unlike a bike.
If it starts to rain,
I can call an Uber,
and I can put it
right in the trunk.
But can I go back to one thing?
Have you sold any? Right?
[ Chuckling ]
Great question.
So, we set up
nine global distributors
that are gonna carry
our product.
We have $5.6 million
in pre?orders
with those distributors,
which we'll be able to fulfill
by the end
of this year.
And people that live
in apartments ??
O'Leary: I think we've seen
the merits of the product.
We understand the risks.
I'm interested.
So, I'm thinking about
structuring an offer here.
You need capital,
so what about a deal like this?
I'll drop the equity ask
down to 2.5%,
and I'll loan you
the $750,000
at an 8% balloon payment
in 36 months.
Herjavec:
It's the "Loan Shark Tank."
I'm taking 2.5% equity
as a kicker.
Haley: What I'd like to do is
first explain
the difference in valuation from
the last round to now.
Fair.
You can do that.
But no one's beaten you up
on that yet.
I was gonna
do that work later.
Right. Yeah,
I figured that much,
so I'm just gonna
kind of pre?empt it.
Thank you. Yeah.
So, since
the last round,
we've de?risked the company
considerably.
Um, we, uh...
Like I said,
we secured ??
If you don't remember
why it's de?risked, that's bad.
[ Laughter ]
Sometimes
it gets a little ??
That was a bad time
to pause!
[ Laughs ]
We secured the largest
contract manufacturer
in the United States.
We raised enough money
to where we can get to be
cash?flow positive.
We also are in talks with
the largest big?box retailer ??
Best Buy.
So, if it's okay with you,
Mr. Wonderful,
I'd like to hear
from the rest of the panel.
Sure.
Herjavec:
I mean, I love ?? I love toys.
I mean, you name it ??
If it goes fast, it's risky,
I'll do it.
For your value...
Mm?hmm.
... which I'm not even
gonna touch,
I have to buy into
the premise
that this is
a mass?transportation product,
and regardless
of what Chris Sacca thinks,
Guys, like Chris said,
there's a lot of people
just focusing
on that market.
I think it's a stretch
partially because we compete,
but for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thanks, Mark.
I really appreciate your time.
Thank you, Mark.
Herjavec:
All right, Lori?
She was just trying to
do Kevin's deal math over here.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: I like it.
I think it's very cool.
I love ingenuity.
But great you have distributors.
People think it's cool,
but people in that business
always think
new things are cool.
They're waiting
for the next new thing.
They buy 50, 100, 300.
They test it.
It doesn't mean
they'll come back for more.
Look, I'm happy with my offer,
but if she goes out,
it won't be 2.5% equity because
it's the nature of a Shark,
when there's no competitors,
to make you
pay a horrible price.
You understand that.
You should tell me
if you're in or out.
Am I competing with you
or not?
Narrator: Three Sharks are out.
Dave, Chris, and Ryan have
one offer on the table
from Kevin for their electric
skateboard company, Inboard.
But Kevin is threatening
a worse offer if Lori goes out.
Am I competing with you
or not?
I would give you
the $750,000 loan,
8% interest, 36 month,
3% equity.
Is it possible
we can discuss this as a team?
?Absolutely.
?Perfect.
?Awesome.
Herjavec:
Half a point difference
between the two of you.
Half a point.
Otherwise,
exact same offer.
Who do we want more
as a partner?
Do we want Mr. Wonderful,
or do we want Lori?
Lori ?? She's got
the retail side,
and that can be
a huge help.
What should we do?
All right, let's do it.
Let's do it.
All right.
All right?
Yeah, you say it.
Okay, I'm with you.
As many others have learned
in the Shark Tank,
when you leave the tank,
stuff happens.
And stuff did happen
on this deal.
Lori and I decided
to get together on it,
and we're gonna split it,
but there is a cost
because it's
your only offer.
We're gonna give you the
$750,000 for 36 months at 8%,
but we want 5% equity
'cause we want 2.5% each.
You get a whole lot of support
from both of us,
but you're gonna
have to pay a little bit more
because
you left the tank.
Haley:
We want to do a deal
that's gonna actually get by
our investors.
We have a couple
of founders
that have exited
from billion?dollar companies.
You guys know how big the egos
can be in those circles.
So have we.
We were gonna
counter your offer ??
$750,000, 8% ??
Lori's original deal ??
3%, which we were gonna
turn down,
but now that we have
two Sharks,
we're gonna
be willing to do it.
?So everybody understands...
?Yes.
?Yeah.
...your counter is a
$750,000 loan at 8% interest...
Yeah.
...paid off
after 36 months...
Right.
... and in exchange for that,
you will give them
3% equity
between the two of them.
?Yeah, 1.5% each.
That's correct.
?That's correct.
?1.5%
What do you say,
Kevin, Lori?
Unfortunately, I've discussed
this with my partner, Lori.
We have
no flexibility.
The best deals are ones
where you squirm a little bit.
I want
to see you squirm.
The squirming's gonna be
when I go back to my investors
and put that deal
in front of them.
There's no way I can go above
3% equity with a loan.
How about this ?? We would
be willing to pay more interest.
What about 11%?
Certainly not 11%.
That's more.
[ Laughter ]
But I would ??
I would do the ??
Well, what's ?? What's
your counter ?? That is more.
What's your counter
on the equity if I paid you 9%?
All right, we'll do it
at 9% at 4% equity.
So, $750,000 loan at 9%,
which is nothing.
At least let's just say
we're shareholders,
but, really, it's a tip.
We'll do that deal.
You should take it.
How about this?
I'll do 10% interest.
I need ?? I cannot go above
the 3% equity.
10% interest, 3% equity.
Why can you not
go above the 3%?
'Cause I just know
what our investors have put in
as bounds as what
they're willing to accept,
and the fact
that this is a loan ??
You were offering 4%
when you walked in here.
Chris, when you
walked in here...
Yes.
...you offered 4%
for $750,000 straight equity.
I don't think it's unreasonable
to stay at the 4%,
give you
the $750,000 at 9%.
You walk out of here
with a deal.
You know
you can give us 4%
'cause you asked for that
in the beginning.
You know, I thought Ryan was
the best salesman
I ever met in my life.
I think you're just as good.
You both have a deal.
[ All cheering ]
?[ Laughs ]
?Congratulations, guys.
?Yeah. Lori.
I bet you didn't expect me.
[ Laughs ]
Congrats.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
Uh?huh.
?Ready?
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
Here we go.
[ All cheering ]
The last two years, we've been
building a rocket ship
at Inboard.
Today we put a button ??
a big red button ??
in front of Lori and Kevin,
and they hit it.
And we can't wait
to ride this thing to the moon.
Yeah, they did.
Hit that button, son!
Narrator: In Season 7,
mother?and?daughter team
Gloria Hoffman and Linda Clark
made a deal with Lori Greiner
for their exercise device,
the Simply Fit Board.
I make millionaires this way.
I'm gonna offer you
$125,000 at 20%.
Lori, we would love
to accept your offer.
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.
Hoffman: Before "Shark Tank,"
we had done $575,000 in sales.
24 hours after
being on "Shark Tank,"
we did $1.25 million
in sales.
Clark: The very next day
after "Shark Tank,"
we went on to QVC,
and we sold out of boards
in just six minutes.
Lori had the idea to produce
a Simply Fit Board infomercial.
We expanded across the U. S.,
and now we're in Japan, Europe,
all around the world.
Now just seven months later,
we are up to $9 million,
and it's still climbing.
[ Gasps ]
Oh, my gosh!
Greiner:
Walmart's a big deal because
they have a lot of stores,
and we're in
every single one of them.
When something changes
your life, it's a crying moment.
To see the effect
on Gloria,
to see how much
it's changed her life,
that's why I do what I do.
That's why I'm a Shark.
I'm so thankful.
Nobody deserves it better
than you guys.
You've worked hard.
You created something great.
You're great people.
My belief ??
What goes around comes around.
Thinking about
our journey ??
[ Voice breaking ]
I get emotional every time.
When you're a mom
that wants to show your kids
that anything
is possible ??
I mean, I was
a struggling mom to them,
and overnight,
my whole life changed.
That's perfect.
We are so thankful
for our "Shark Tank" experience,
and I think
that Mom and I are proof
that a grandma
and a stay?at?home mom
can become
an overnight success.
It truly is
the American dream.
Yeah, sure,
I'll share with Chris.
Awesome. Thank you.
You can go first?
[ Laughs ]
Here you go.
Thank you.
Yeah, of course.
Hi!
Oh, man,
that's a lucky dog.
Herjavec:
Mark will try it.
Yeah, give it to Mark.
He'll eat anything.
Perfect.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Herjavec:
And what's it like?
It's good.
Buddy, can you sit?
Down.
Good boy!
Good boy!
Herjavec: Aww.
Okay, go!
Cuban: Yeah.
And, Chris, I notice
you haven't asked a question.
I would love to be able
to convince you
why I believe
there's a market for this.
I'm deeply conflicted
on this deal, man.
I hear about your background,
and I think
to have attained that
is incredibly impressive.
To go as a black kid
from New Orleans to MIT
and to have all that educational
achievement is incredible.
You're like the dream partner
I would love to work with
or back
in any of our companies.
Problem is
you chose the one
that we're competing with you
in from UberRUSH, right?
We're pushing couriers
all over the world right now,
and we're moving food
all over the world right now.
So, for me,
it's harder to get super?excited
about funding a guy
who's gonna knock right head?on
into one of
our businesses.
If this thing doesn't pan out,
please get in touch immediately,
'cause I know we'd be
a great force,
but I can't do this deal.
I'm out.
Thank you, Chris.
I appreciate that.
Well said, Chris.
Look, there's things
out there
that are better
for your cognition
than just your ordinary
cup of coffee.
We're at the forefront
of doing research
and actually figuring out
what these things are
and telling
the story about it.
O'Leary:
Guys, I've made a lot of money
as an investor
obeying the laws of gravity.
And I think you guys are flying
very close to the sun.
Your valuation is the highest
I've ever seen on the carpet.
I'm not saying
you can't pull it off,
but it won't be
with my money.
I'm out.
Thanks.
Geoff, this is
the highest valuation
we've ever had
on "Shark Tank."
For sugar cubes.
We've never had any company
for $40 million.
At what point does the company
become worth that?
Look, when you go
to invest in Apple,
you're not
investing in Apple
because of their current
product lineup.
[ Laughs ]
Let him go.
Let him go. Let him go.
Well, you have two Sharks
left ?? Kevin and Chris.
Well, we'd love to hear
what Chris has to say.
I would, too.
Chris?
That's 10%
of your company.
Correct.
Are you gonna take
a board seat over there?
I don't need a board seat.
I need 10%.
Are you gonna co?office
with them?
My bottom line is
this is a lot of risk,
and you know it, too.
I'm very curious, though,
about this equity.
Let's talk about
how those notes work.
So you had
$2 million worth of investment
come in
on a document that says,
"We're investing as if
the price were $10 million."
But later on,
the price is $5 million,
and they convert
into the company.
Subject to that $10 million cap,
it comes all the way down
at a big discount now.
Those investors are gonna own
most of your company.
You guys, as the founders,
aren't gonna own anything.
Just to be clear,
if you do a deal at $5 million,
how much of the company
do you end up owning?
How much do the investors
end up owning?
Right now we own 51%.
Well, you're not after this.
I'm gonna make it
easier for you.
Chris Sacca,
give us a deal.
I'm out.
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
around the first
and second round.
No, I ?? Look, Chris,
I think it's a great deal
for you. I really, really do.
The earlier investors
took a risk.
They knew they were
taking a risk.
Things didn't play out for them
exactly like they wanted.
It's not
the first down ??
So, I don't feel bad
taking it out of their hides.
It's not
the first?down round.
It's not
the last?down round...
That's true.
... that'll ever happen.
