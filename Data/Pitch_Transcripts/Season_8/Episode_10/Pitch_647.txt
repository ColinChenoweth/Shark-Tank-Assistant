Herjavec: Regardless of
what Chris Sacca thinks,
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Ryan Evans.
Ryan:
Oh, there he goes.
Sacca: He shreds.
Ryan:
Yeah, that's correct.
Why is yours unique?
The fact that we created
the first ever in?wheel motor.
It's actually
one of the smallest
hub motors ever created.
The way we integrated
the battery into the deck.
But, really,
the biggest difference
But, Ryan,
it's a skateboard.
Yes.
It's a toy.
Haley:
We would disagree with that.
A lot of people see that
as their vehicle.
Really?
Cuban:
But that's a niche market.
Nobody is gonna commute to work
with a skateboard
that isn't commuting to work
with a skateboard today.
Man, sometimes,
you sound really old.
This is happening today
at scale.
Really?
Yeah, maybe not in Toronto
because you have to
dig out of snow half the year,
but here in California,
it's happening at scale.
I actually do see them
as a vehicle or as a tool.
Yeah, but when Chris
talks about scale, he's wrong.
Just because you see individuals
driving around on skateboards
doesn't mean it's scale.
One of my companies
is working on re?inventing
the self?balancing
"Hoverboards," right?
Mm?hmm.
There's challenges
there, right?
Absolutely.
There's laws in terms of riding
on the sidewalks.
There's inclines.
There's bumps in the road.
Ryan: Yeah.
So, people want
a better way.
Wait, didn't you just tell me
that I'm wrong about scale,
that this isn't
gonna scale?
It's a whole
different beast.
The skateboard market
is completely different
than the Hoverboard
'cause one is a lot easier
to balance on.
Guys, like Chris said,
there's a lot of people
just focusing
on that market.
I think it's a stretch
partially because we compete,
but for those reasons,
I'm out.
Thanks, Mark.
I really appreciate your time.
Thank you, Mark.
Herjavec:
All right, Lori?
She was just trying to
do Kevin's deal math over here.
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: I like it.
I think it's very cool.
I love ingenuity.
But great you have distributors.
People think it's cool,
but people in that business
always think
new things are cool.
They're waiting
for the next new thing.
They buy 50, 100, 300.
They test it.
It doesn't mean
they'll come back for more.
Look, I'm happy with my offer,
but if she goes out,
it won't be 2.5% equity because
it's the nature of a Shark,
when there's no competitors,
to make you
Chris, when you
walked in here...
Yes.
...you offered 4%
for $750,000 straight equity.
I don't think it's unreasonable
to stay at the 4%,
give you
the $750,000 at 9%.
You walk out of here
with a deal.
You know
you can give us 4%
'cause you asked for that
in the beginning.
You know, I thought Ryan was
the best salesman
I ever met in my life.
I think you're just as good.
You both have a deal.
[ All cheering ]
?[ Laughs ]
?Congratulations, guys.
?Yeah. Lori.
I bet you didn't expect me.
[ Laughs ]
Congrats.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
Uh?huh.
?Ready?
?Yeah.
?Yeah.
Here we go.
[ All cheering ]
The last two years, we've been
building a rocket ship
at Inboard.
Today we put a button ??
a big red button ??
Yeah, sure,
I'll share with Chris.
Awesome. Thank you.
You can go first?
[ Laughs ]
Here you go.
Thank you.
Yeah, of course.
Hi!
Oh, man,
that's a lucky dog.
Herjavec:
Mark will try it.
Yeah, give it to Mark.
He'll eat anything.
Perfect.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Thank you, Chris.
I appreciate that.
Well said, Chris.
Look, there's things
out there
that are better
for your cognition
than just your ordinary
cup of coffee.
We're at the forefront
of doing research
Well, we'd love to hear
what Chris has to say.
I would, too.
Chris?
That's 10%
of your company.
Correct.
Are you gonna take
a board seat over there?
I don't need a board seat.
I need 10%.
Are you gonna co?office
with them?
My bottom line is
this is a lot of risk,
I'm gonna make it
easier for you.
Chris Sacca,
give us a deal.
I'm out.
Narrator:
Four Sharks are out.
