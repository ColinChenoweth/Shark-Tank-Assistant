So, how's
the business going?
Webb: It's good.
My mom's gone through so much
in her life.
She made a lot of sacrifices
for me to get to where I am,
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Renaldo Webb.
This is Winston.
Winston can
smell it coming.
He's so hungry.
So, Sharks, who wants to give
Winston's favorite dish a try?
I'm in.
[ Laughter ]
Mark.
I'm in.
Yeah, Mark
will eat anything.
Get it, Winston.
So, this is
a home delivery service...
Yes.
... for fresh,
real food...
Exactly.
... for pets.
Exactly. So, you can imagine it
as a plated, for example...
Yeah.
... but it's freshly cooked,
so ready to go
from box to bowl as soon as you
get your delivery.
Is it a subscription service?
Do you sign up?
So, right now you sign up
for a month, 3, 6, or 12.
Our average subscription length
is three months right now.
O'Leary:
What's the price?
How much does it cost?
What's the pricing?
So, we charge this
by the pound.
So, it varies
by the price of your dog.
If you have a small,
little Chihuahua,
it's gonna be around 30 ??
30 bucks a month.
Wow, Renaldo,
you're one impressive guy.
Greiner:
Yeah, very impressive.
Thank you. Thank you.
But I'm curious.
So, you quit your job then.
Yes.
How much did you raise,
Renaldo?
I didn't raise any money.
Good for you.
You used
all your own money?
I put in about $80,000
of my own money.
Good for you.
Wow.
O'Leary:
My big issue with this deal
is knowing that the challenges
we had with Plated to get scale,
you're gonna need
a ton of money.
No, no, we're not.
Why not?
See, Renaldo, for me, like,
I see you as a real hero.
My concern is I see this
as a challenging business
because of obstacles
that have to do more with
how many people
will care enough to invest
in the fresh,
home?cooked meals.
Robert's point of pivoting,
possibly,
Renaldo, I think
you're amazing, right?
Your accomplishments
speak for themselves.
The thing about
the pet business,
whether it's
food or otherwise,
is that it's
an all?in business.
