Hey, Sharks.
My name is Geoffrey Woo.
That's a different market,
though, Michael.
It's a different market.
It's not really different
'cause that's what people have
for performance.
Why are people mixing powders
off the Internet?
Michael, I accept the fact
that you guys are really smart.
But there's a responsibility
that you have
when you're presenting
at a $40 million value.
If you can't
justify that today,
I'm not really listening
to you anymore
'cause I can't get over
that single thought.
I don't care
how smart you are.
I don't care
what your background is.
I don't think you did a good job
of explaining that to me.
I'm out.
All right, thanks.
I mean, look, I'm not offended
at all by your price.
Woo:
Bio?hacking is meant to spawn
multi?billion?dollar companies,
right?
So, $40 million
valuation ??
You know, it's gonna be cheap
in the long run.
It just scares the hell
out of me as an investor,
