My name is Renaldo Webb,
and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
I grew up in New Orleans,
and my sisters and I were raised
by a single mom.
My mom did everything
to support us.
She took a job as a cafeteria
lunch lady to make ends meet.
From an early age, I was always
excited by science and math.
I was the first person
in my family to go to college.
I went to MIT,
where I got my degree in physics
and also found my passion
for entrepreneurship
and organization.
After college, I got
a high?paying job
helping Fortune 500 companies
with their
manufacturing efforts.
I traveled around the world,
and I really got to see
food production done
at a massive scale.
Here you go.
I realized that
the average consumer has no idea
what's in their food
and would be shocked
if they knew how it was made.
So, how's
the business going?
Webb: It's good.
My mom's gone through so much
in her life.
She made a lot of sacrifices
for me to get to where I am,
and I don't want
to let her down.
I gave up my job
making over $250,000 a year.
I can no longer
help my family
in the ways
that I would like to.
So, if I don't get a deal
from the Sharks,
it's gonna be hard for me
to keep this going.
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Renaldo Webb.
This is Winston.
And we're from Brooklyn,
New York.
I'm the CEO
and founder of PetPlate.
And Winston here ??
He's our chief tasting officer.
And together
we're seeking $100,000
in exchange for a 10% stake
in our company.
PetPlate is the only company
delivering freshly cooked food
tailored for your pet
directly to your door.
Now, Sharks, I'm sure you're
familiar with the health issues
plaguing Americans ??
everything from cancer,
Winston can
smell it coming.
He's so hungry.
Then we add in some peas
and carrots.
We have pumpkin.
This is for fiber.
It makes
the morning walks great.
And then finally, we have
our healthy oils and vitamins.
So, Sharks, who wants to give
Winston's favorite dish a try?
I'm in.
[ Laughter ]
Mark.
I'm in.
Yeah, Mark
will eat anything.
As I said, this is our
lamb and vegetables dish here.
How about you, Lori?
Do you want to give it
a little try, as well?
Get it, Winston.
So, this is
a home delivery service...
Yes.
... for fresh,
real food...
Exactly.
... for pets.
Exactly. So, you can imagine it
as a plated, for example...
Yeah.
... but it's freshly cooked,
so ready to go
from box to bowl as soon as you
get your delivery.
Is it a subscription service?
Do you sign up?
So, right now you sign up
for a month, 3, 6, or 12.
Our average subscription length
is three months right now.
O'Leary:
What's the price?
How much does it cost?
What's the pricing?
So, we charge this
by the pound.
So, it varies
by the price of your dog.
If you have a small,
little Chihuahua,
it's gonna be around 30 ??
30 bucks a month.
And how many meals
do I get per month?
Greiner:
There goes the table.
[ Laughter ]
So you get your full ??
So you sign up
on our website.
You go in, and you put in
the weight of your dog.
And then it takes you
to our meal?plan options.
You can try between getting
the full PetPlate
meal plan subscription ??
so 14 meals a week.
And then we space it out
in terms of two deliveries
a week for you.
And how much is it
per week?
Webb: Depends on
the size of the dog.
Depends on
the size of the dog.
How many times
do you got to say it?
All right, so,
I got a Chihuahua.
So, how many subscribers
do you have?
So we have just over 100
subscribers right now ?? 105.
100? That's it?
How long have you been
in business?
For about
eight months now.
We're actually just hitting
the eight?month mark.
And it's just in New York?
You're just doing locally?
So, right now, we can ship
to anywhere
within a 300?mile radius
of New York City,
but I am laser?focused
on making this
an urban type of service.
Why don't you have
more than 100 subscribers?
Right now,
I am a one?man show.
In order to emulate
the models that are out there
with the big guys,
they've gone through
this multi?year
logistics problem
of building centers
in all the major areas
so they can fulfill.
So, how
we're different is
it's far simpler to cook
for a dog.
We have a set menu ??
about six options.
We can cook
about 200 to 300 pounds of food
in about three to four hours.
What's your background?
I was born in New Orleans.
My mom was a cafeteria worker
at the local public high school.
I was passionate about
science and mathematics.
Cool.
I then went to MIT,
where I graduated
with a degree
in physics there.
Wow.
I realized
I wasn't the savant
that was gonna
discover gravitational waves,
even though
I really wanted to.
But I found my passion
for organization
and entrepreneurship.
I traveled all around the world
helping Fortune 500 companies
with their supply?chain ??
manufacturing, like,
on the factory floor.
And that's where I got the bulk
of my pet?food experience ??
watching this food get made,
seeing the ingredients go in,
and seeing why the health
of American pets is ??
Honestly, it's dismal.
You know, I really wanted
to change that.
Wow, Renaldo,
you're one impressive guy.
Greiner:
Yeah, very impressive.
Thank you. Thank you.
But I'm curious.
So, you quit your job then.
Yes.
And you're running this
full time by yourself?
Exactly. But
the delivery couriers we use ??
They're being paid in full.
We're still losing
a little bit of money
on the per?delivery cost
and the logistics.
How much did you raise,
Renaldo?
I didn't raise any money.
Good for you.
You used
all your own money?
I put in about $80,000
of my own money.
Good for you.
Wow.
O'Leary:
My big issue with this deal
is knowing that the challenges
we had with Plated to get scale,
you're gonna need
a ton of money.
No, no, we're not.
Why not?
We're already
delivering and doing
over 150 deliveries
with one courier.
Where's the tipping point?
How do you get to...big?
So, when we hit 500 dogs,
this is a half?a?million?dollar
business.
Why don't I,
in a commercial kitchen,
create the best pet food,
premium product,
but not make it
completely fresh?
Why deliver it
to people?
If it kind of came down to it,
and I realized, "You know what?
I need to put natural
preservatives in this to win,"
that's what I would do.
See, Renaldo, for me, like,
I see you as a real hero.
My concern is I see this
as a challenging business
because of obstacles
that have to do more with
how many people
will care enough to invest
in the fresh,
home?cooked meals.
Robert's point of pivoting,
possibly,
and creating something
that's easier to sustain
seems to make sense to me,
but it doesn't fit your mission.
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
I appreciate all the feedback
on that, Lori.
I'm not sure
that the market is there.
If there was a cause
in a small community
that's deeply passionate
about their dogs,
it would have spread
to more than 100 users
after eight months.
I'm sorry.
I admire
what you're doing,
but I don't see the business
right now.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Renaldo, I think
you're amazing, right?
Your accomplishments
speak for themselves.
The thing about
the pet business,
whether it's
food or otherwise,
is that it's
an all?in business.
You've got to eat, sleep,
and drink pets 24?7.
But I'm not
a 24?by?7 pet guy.
And you need that infrastructure
and support around you
from people who have
that same mind?set.
I'm out.
Thank you.
I'm living this right now
with Plated,
and they're doing
quite well,
but they've learned the hard way
how difficult it is to scale.
Our biggest issue remains
to be competition for customers,
and we are delivering, and we're
having sustained customers.
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna
take the journey with you.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Congratulations, man.
You're gonna crush it.
Good luck.
Thank you for the time.
I'm feeling
a lot of frustration
just because I'm tired
of hearing "no."
[ Voice breaking ]
But it doesn't matter
how hard I have to work.
So... yeah.
Very frustrated, but, you know,
it was never gonna be easy,
and I know that.
And it never has been, so...
We know our business more
than anyone else in the world.
Let's power pose.
This is my house.
This is our house!
Man:
Tape's rolling. Stand by.
Let's go! Go! Go!
