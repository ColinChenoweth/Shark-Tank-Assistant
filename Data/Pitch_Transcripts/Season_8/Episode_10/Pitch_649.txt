Hey, Sharks.
My name is Geoffrey Woo.
My name is
Michael Brandt.
We're from San Francisco,
California.
Our company is Nootrobox,
and we're seeking $2 million
in exchange for a 5% stake
in our company.
Oh! Hello!
[ Laughter ]
So Nootrobox isn't
any ordinary company.
We're a team of bio?hackers,
researchers, and technologists.
And we develop, manufacture,
and sell nootropics.
Nootropics are
a rapidly growing market
of brain?enhancing consumables
and supplements.
We're from Silicon Valley,
where some of the most creative
and ambitious people
in the entire world are.
And these people are
constantly trying to eke
more productivity
out of each and every day.
Bio?hacking is all about
the experimentation
and controlling of inputs
into the human body
as if our bodies are
a complex
but still understandable
computer system.
We've looked
at something
that hundreds of millions
of Americans put into their body
on a daily basis ??
a classic cup of coffee.
We've looked at ways
to re?engineer coffee
for something
that's significantly better
for performance.
And it's called Go Cubes
Chewable Coffee!
It's convenient
and portable,
you can put it
right in your pocket,
and unlike any ordinary
cup of joe,
it's precisely dosed with
caffeine and other nootropics
so you get
the kick of coffee,
but it's much more balanced
and steady.
The future of coffee is here,
and we want you Sharks
to take a bite out of it.
Herjavec:
Can we try it?
Yeah.
So, Geoff, just want to be
clear, it was $2 million for 5%?
Correct.
And to be clear, you named it
after me ?? Cubes, right?
[ Chuckles ]
Of course.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
Sure.
Do you mind
if you tell us
more about what's in them
before we eat them?
It's ??
I don't want
to get roofied.
[ Laughs ]
So, you have three different
flavors of Go Cubes.
from lightest to darkest,
you have latte,
drip coffee, and mocha.
Each cube has
50 milligrams of caffeine.
It's a half a cup
of coffee.
How much sugar?
Six grams of sugar
per cube.
Oh, wow.
It's really good.
And one thing that's really
great about Go Cubes is because
it's exactly that
50 milligrams of caffeine,
you know exactly
what you're getting.
But this is not
the first supplement?type item
that has a defined amount
of caffeine in it.
So, our background is
bio?hackers, right?
But first ??
first, lots of people
call themselves
bio?hackers.
Two years ago,
it was just someone
who was trying to come up
with a better formulation.
Yeah, but I think ??
So, let's just talk in terms
of what you're actually doing.
Yeah, so, I think in terms
of actually speaking
about the community ??
A community of what?
Of people that are
bio?hacking with us.
So, for instance,
we fast.
We do intermittent fasting
on a weekly basis,
where for 36 hours straight,
we consume zero calories.
Just water.
Why is that good?
So, actually,
caloric restriction is actually
one of the most compelling ways
to increase longevity.
So, you're looking at nutrition.
You're looking at activity.
You're looking at sleep.
You're looking
at all these different things
and how
they impact the body.
Yeah.
So, there is a space here,
but why ??
Okay,
but why is this ??
Why is this cube
worth $40 million?
We started the business in 2014.
We did $55,000 in sales.
And we've done, year?to?date,
almost $1 million revenue.
And we're getting 17%
month?over?month revenue growth.
Are you guys scientists?
Are you guys engineers?
We're
computer scientists.
Both of you are
computer scientists?
We have four MB/PhDs
on our team.
Okay.
Greiner:
Let's go back to the basics.
What is this product?
Yeah, yeah.
Basically,
from a performance ??
Why is this special?
So, there's amino acid found
in green tea called L?theanine.
So, caffeine
and L?theanine together ??
So, there's actually a bunch of
trials showing the effects
of that active
combination ingredient
versus caffeine alone
versus placebo.
So, simple reaction time
reduces 50% more in terms of ??
so a baseline
of 330 milliseconds ??
Okay, so this is ??
Okay ??
So, what ??
what ?? what ??
A better absorption?
Better methods?
A simple reaction time,
increased semantic memories.
Hey, Robert.
You just ate one of these.
Can you remember where we are
in this pitch?
[ Laughs ]
Sorry.
What did you say?
Hey, you've got an opportunity
to tell this story
to 8 million to 10 million
Americans right now
on a recurring basis.
The most valuable prime time
airtime in the world right now.
And you're blowing it.
Tell this story.
Brandt:
You're investing in Apple
because of their approach
to technology...
[ Laughs ]
...their ability to do R&amp;D,
to product?ize,
and to bring it
to market.
[ All talking indistinctly ]
But that's
what we're asking you.
Herjavec: You're not giving us
that answer, Michael.
You came in,
and you gave us sugar cubes.
We've asked you that
like 20 times.
2 billion cups of coffee are
drank every day.
People like coffee.
That's everyone's
go?to nootropic.
That's a different market,
though, Michael.
It's a different market.
It's not really different
'cause that's what people have
for performance.
Why are people mixing powders
off the Internet?
Michael, I accept the fact
that you guys are really smart.
But there's a responsibility
that you have
when you're presenting
at a $40 million value.
If you can't
justify that today,
I'm not really listening
to you anymore
'cause I can't get over
that single thought.
I don't care
how smart you are.
I don't care
what your background is.
I don't think you did a good job
of explaining that to me.
I'm out.
All right, thanks.
I mean, look, I'm not offended
at all by your price.
And I can see how you can get
to your type of price
based on your sales
and trajectory.
That said,
it scares the hell out of me.
I've tried nootropics.
That's what people use
to go on 48?hour coding binges.
But at the end of the day,
you're left with a headache,
lack of recall sometimes.
I'm worried about the long?term
consequences, and so I'm out.
All of our ingredients
are generally regarded as safe.
"Generally regarded"
is not the same as "safe."
I think that you're much more
into the scientist brain
and not realizing
that some of us up here
weren't understanding
what it was
you were trying
to sell to us.
I feel it would be helpful
to you if you got somebody
who was more sales?oriented
that would be able
to communicate for you,
when you need it,
about what your vision is
in going down the sales path.
I am out.
I'm not investing today.
But I wish you good luck.
Appreciate it.
Part of the problem
in Silicon Valley is
that the valuations
are priced to perfection
because
that's their approach.
And if you were to come in here
priced with uncertainty,
okay, then we might have been
able to make the deal,
but you priced it in the Silicon
Valley way, and so I'm out.
Cool.
All right.
Thanks so much.
Thanks, you guys.
Good luck, you guys.
Cool.
Thank you.
Good luck, guys.
Woo:
Bio?hacking is meant to spawn
multi?billion?dollar companies,
right?
So, $40 million
valuation ??
You know, it's gonna be cheap
in the long run.
It just scares the hell
out of me as an investor,
and it scares the hell out of me
as a human being
'cause I don't think
we know
the long?term consequences
of this stuff.
I'll tell you what scares
the hell out of me ??
$40 million for sugar.
Narrator: Next into the tank
are entrepreneurs with a product
that makes gourmet cooking
a breeze.
