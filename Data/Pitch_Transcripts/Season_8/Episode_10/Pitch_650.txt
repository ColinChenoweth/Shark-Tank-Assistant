the wannabe Millennial ??
Man, sometimes you sound
really old.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator: This is the art
of doing business.
Herjavec: You're not giving us
that answer.
We've asked you that
like 20 times.
Narrator:
This is "Shark Tank."
The best deals are ones
where you squirm a little bit.
I want to see you squirm.
Narrator:
First into the tank is a company
hoping to revolutionize
personal transportation.
the wannabe Millennial...
O'Leary: He's a little old
for that now, isn't he?
Cuban: Yeah, he is.
[ Chuckles ]
Herjavec:
... there's an element of skill
that you have to have
in order to use it
that the average older person
is gonna struggle with.
That would not be me because
I was able to master the device.
Yeah, he was
the king on it.
I don't buy the premise of
a mass?transportation vehicle.
I'm out.
Sacca: This is a very crowded,
competitive space.
What I'm trying to do
is invest in places
that other people
haven't noticed yet,
and all eyes are on this.
And so, I might be a consumer,
but in the end,
I'm not gonna invest,
so I'm out.
diabetes, high blood pressure,
which is all due in some way
to what we eat.
And unfortunately,
many of these issues are now
finding their way into our pets
from feeding them the scraps
from our overly processed
food supply chain.
Over 60% of dogs and cats
in America are overweight.
Many more are suffering
from serious issues
such as diabetes and allergies.
And one in two dogs in America
will die from cancer.
So, PetPlate
is solving this issue
by educating
and empowering pet parents
to have healthier
and happier pets.
So, who wants to see what
actually goes into PetPlate?
We do.
Bring it on.
So, we only use all?natural
ingredients in PetPlate
no different than what you'd buy
at a grocery store
to feed your own family.
And today we've
brought over the ingredients
for our lamb
and vegetables dish.
It contains very lean lamb.
Put that in there.
Then we also have eggs.
This is all
of our protein source.
We use potatoes
and sweet potatoes.
Then we also add in...
[ Laughter ]
My name is Lisa,
and this is my husband, Abe.
We're the founders
of Nomiku,
and we hail
from San Francisco.
We're seeking $250,000 in
exchange for 5% of our business.
The top chefs of the world
have a secret tool.
Sous Vide is
a method of cooking
where you take
vacuum?sealed food
and put it in a precise,
low?temperature water bath.
It's a top chef's
secret weapon
because it allows you to craft
delicious, perfect dishes
conveniently
and consistently.
When I worked at top?tier
three Michelin Star restaurants,
I lusted after
these machines,
but they were
thousands of dollars.
Luckily,
I met him at the gym.
[ Herjavec chuckles ]
That's where you pick up
plasma physicists.
[ Laughter ]
And he made an at?home version
just for me.
It changed our lives.
And now we're changing the lives
of home cooks everywhere
with the first ever home
Sous Vide immersion circulator.
Take any pot
and fill it with water,
then you clip Nomiku
to the side of the pot.
You put your ingredients
and seasonings
into a zip?seal
plastic bag.
Put the bag in the water
and walk away.
Our app controls the time
and the temperature
so that you come back
to a perfectly cooked meal.
With a little bit
of TV magic...
[ Laughter ]
... we have some steaks
that have been cooked already
with a Nomiku.
Because we're cooking
at a low temperature,
it doesn't have
that delicious crust around it.
We're gonna
finish that right now.
How long does ??
does it take to cook?
Two hours.
But you don't have to
babysit it.
You can just put the bag in
and walk away.
So, Lisa, we're Sharks.
Are we gonna get to try some?
Absolutely.
So, we start with a perfectly
cooked shrimp cocktail.
And then we have
that perfectly cooked steak.
And we have
a chocolate?coconut custard.
Lisa, what did you used to do?
'Cause you're a natural at this.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
I worked in
the restaurant industry.
And I'm the face of the company,
so I give a lot of talks.
Cuban: Appreciate it.
Thank you.
And now, folks, this is a meal
that we made for you
with vodka that's
been Nomikued
with rhubarb, strawberry,
and limes.
Herjavec: Thank you!
Cheers.
Thank you so much, Scott.
This steak is
fantastic.
[ Chuckles ]
At some point,
you were discussing the value
of this business ??
$5 million, right?
Yes.
You must have sales.
We do, Kevin.
All right.
So, we've sold them
since 2012.
We have...
We have $3 million
in sales.
Wow.
So, how and where
have you been selling it?
We sold them direct
from our website
and from
online retailers.
And we just got a P. O.
from Williams?Sonoma.
Herjavec: I'm not a big chef.
Why would I do this
instead of making it on a stove
or on a barbecue?
What's the benefit
of this whole process?
It's one?button cooking.
It's like a ?? It's like
a slow cooker, a crock pot.
It's a
set?it?and?forget?it.
I cook, as well.
I like to do Burgundian dishes.
What is that?
What's
a Burgundian dish?
Burgundian, for example ??
calves liver.
You don't want
to overcook it.
So, Lisa, I don't know
any of that stuff.
Do you do that
with all organs of your kills?
Could you tell us
what it costs?
Yes, it costs $199.
How much
have you raised?
So we ?? In 2012,
we had a seed round of 875k.
And then last year,
we did a note of $2 million.
Ooh.
$2 million?
Yes.
Cuban: Last year?
So what was the valuation
of the seed round?
The seed round
is $6 million.
And then was there a warrant
on the note?
The note is a 10 cap.
The note's a convert?
Correct.
It's straight convert.
Right.
Hmm.
Cuban: Guys, I think
it's a great product,
but I just don't see
the momentum
that I think
you should have.
I don't really understand
the competitive threats
since I don't know
the industry.
So, I'm out.
So grateful for your time, Mark.
Thank you.
I have had Sous Vide before.
I think it's interesting,
but I do think
that a lot of people just like
to throw steak on the grill,
and they don't want to do
a secondary step
to char their meat
or get it crispy.
I'm not going to invest.
I wish you the best.
I'm out.
Thank you
very much, Lori.
Let me just clear the deck.
Sous Vide ?? Moo Vide ?? I ??
Pbht.
It's all French to me.
It is French.
[ Chuckles ]
Aha.
The idea of planning my meal
like that is just ??
is just foreign.
And I like to invest in stuff
that I have a taste for.
It's just not a market for me.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Abe: Thank you.
I mean, it's funny. It doesn't
matter what it's called.
It just
tastes delicious.
And I just want
to know ??
How did you get to the valuation
you're asking for here?
We expect to have
$5 million in revenue
in the next 12 months,
and our valuation is consistent
with other companies with that
sort of revenue projection.
Basically, you're not gonna
make much money,
even after $5 million.
But are you coming in
under the cap of the last round?
That's...
We know that if we bring
a Shark on,
you guys are gonna be
very hard?core.
You see the value
of having a Shark on the team.
That's right.
We do.
Let's see, Lisa,
if you can get a deal
from one or both of them.
I would love both because
one Shark is like a volcano.
Two Sharks is like a lightning
striking that volcano.
Sharknado.
[ Laughter ]
Sharknado!
Sharknado!
I have two constituencies that
I think this would appeal to.
One are the customers of Plated,
of which I'm an inventor.
They'll be supportive
of a Shark deal, obviously.
And the other are
my quarter of a million people
who have bought my wines.
They're all foodies.
I make the suggestions.
They believe me
because I'm really good at it,
and I have the palate.
I'll do this deal ??
$250,000.
I want 10%.
We really respect
that offer.
Thank you.
It comes from the heart.
The biggest allure to this deal
is you, Lisa.
I think you're the package
right here.
Thank you.
I love your presence.
I love how well you've handled
these questions.
You're an amazing
entrepreneurial force.
As we talk about the terms
of this deal, though,
I really get worried
when I see a deal
that leaves you not owning much
of the company at all.
How do you help me
get past that?
Sure. We're here
with that deal
to make it
appetizing for you.
That's why I'm up here.
I'm ??
So, are you throwing my deal
under the bus?
I get that, but I don't want
to work with people
who don't have a ton of upside
left in their own company.
They're not happy.
We'd love to give you
adviser shares.
Lisa, I'm gonna make it
easier for you.
Chris Sacca is interested
in Abe and Lisa's
Sous Vide machine, Nomiku,
but is concerned
that his investment would result
in them diluting
their equity so much,
they would no longer have skin
in the game.
The best deals are the deals
where we are all super?excited
to get out of bed every morning
because we're all gonna make
a lot of money.
We're all gonna have
positive impact.
So, if we go and do this deal,
you guys would be diluted
to the teens.
And so at the end of this round,
how much of the company
would you guys like to own?
See, I think a couple
owning 10% of the company
doesn't get it done.
Okay, what do you...?
What do you think?
It's the craziest deal
I've ever seen.
I ??
Greiner: It is.
I don't want you guys
to shoot yourselves in the foot.
We won't.
If this is your life's work,
and this is your passion,
you should be fighting as hard
as you can to not give it away.
We're listening to you.
We're listening to you.
Because this takes off
with us together.
Here's my offer.
I'm gonna give you 250k...
for 10% of the company...
contingent upon you going back
to your other investors
and making sure you get
enough stock back from them
that you own 40% of the company
at the end of the deal.
I get 10%, you get 40%,
they get 50%.
Would you ?? Would you be open
to a counter of 8%?
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my gosh!
Really?!
After all that ??
all that work he did for you
and looked out for you,
you're gonna
rake him over for 2%?
So, you guys are
suddenly ??
I'm doing
what he told me to do.
I don't think you're pausing
to think about it.
I think you're just
reflexively trying to squeeze
a couple more points
out of me.
So, pausing
to think about it ??
Don't negotiate
for the sake of negotiating.
Lisa: Okay. Okay.
That deal's not possible
without taking down
your other investors about 15%.
They know that.
But they get to negotiate
with them.
Those investors are
all grown?ups
who got into a risky company
earlier on.
Do we have a deal?
We're gonna take it.
All right!
Let's do it!
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Cheers.
Right on, man.
Thank you.
Hey, congrats.
This is cool.
Yeah,
thank you so much.
Thank you, guys.
All right, guys.
Greiner: Bye.
Oh, they're skipping!
Herjavec:
Oh, they're skipping down ??
Lisa: Wow, Chris Sacca is
the freaking bomb.
We're gonna get
such a fighter on our side.
He really ?? He really loves us
and looked out for us.
That was amazing.
They obviously
undervalued themselves
