My name is Sarah Blain,
Hi, my name is Sarah Blain,
Great!
?Oh.
?Aw.
Thanks, Santa.
Hey, listen, bozo,
I'm litigating.
[ Laughter ]
I really hope you're on
your best behavior
so I can go back
to the North Pole
?Thank you, Sarah.
?There's one. Thank you.
?Lori, right from Santa.
?Thank you.
Thank you.
Shocking how they can fit coal
in one of those envelopes.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Look at my Nice list.
This is the envelope
you're mailing?
Yes.
Oh, Rudolph signed it,
too, Sarah.
Yes, he does.
So as you can see,
each letter is personalized
to you.
So what happens is, um,
When did you start it, Sarah?
So I started this
10 years ago.
?Wow.
?Oh, 10 years.
Sarah has one offer
on the table from Kevin
for her letters?from?Santa
business Sealed by Santa.
But he wants a third
of her company.
The offer's so good
you're crying?
[ Crying ] Yeah.
No, you know what?
Well, then take it.
Forget these guys.
I would, but,
unfortunately,
I am the sole winner
of my family [sniffles]
Herjavec: Sarah,
you said to Kevin's offer
that you have to make a certain
amount of money out of it.
How much money do you need
to pull out
of the business every year?
I mean, I'd take
a $60,000 revenue now,
but, um...
to be at that $100,000 is
kind of where I need to be.
Herjavec:
Sarah, I like it.
I mean, I ?? I get your need
for a salary,
so, you know, Kevin said
you get 2/3, he gets 1/3.
Bye!
?Congrats, Sarah.
Bye!
Whew. Okay.
That was crazy.
I couldn't give up 33%
of my company.
I needed this for my kids,
