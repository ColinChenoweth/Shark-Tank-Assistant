Hi, Sharks, my name
is Jim Loughran.
I'm seeking $150,000 for 20%
equity in my business.
I'm here today
to bring the rink home.
What do people use it for,
Jim?
Figure skating, typically,
they like to ??
Jim, what does it cost?
What does that size cost?
?$69.95.
?For one square?
For the cost of one panel.
If I was buying your panels
in that format,
how many would I need
to make this? Take a guess.
You would probably need
three racks of the 24.
So I would take 60 times $70,
that would give me
the cost of this.
Correct.
So the cost of this would be
$4,200, for this display.
Jim, who sells most
of these for you?
I sell them all myself.
?So you're direct?to?consumer?
?Is it online?
I do everything, yeah.
Jim, how many competitors
do you have you have online?
There's about
six other competitors
that are doing something similar
that I'm doing online.
Come on, Jim,
up that energy.
?Okay.
?Jim, look,
millions of people
are going to see this.
You can't be
half?ass about it.
This is your show.
?Sure.
?Right?
This has got to be
the most important
thing in the world
to you.
You got to
sell it that way.
So why are you better
than anybody else? Tell us.
Because the product that
I developed is infused
Yeah. So, Jim, we shouldn't
have to pull teeth
to get you to do
these things, right?
It shouldn't be,
"I'm going to do."
?Pleasure.
?Good luck, Jim.
?Good luck.
?Thank you.
If I had a second chance
to get back in there,
obviously I would light
the place up.
If they think otherwise,
then I can't change that,
but I can tell you this ??
when it comes to selling
the product,
