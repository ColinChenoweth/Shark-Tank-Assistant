My name is Sarah Blain,
and I live with my two beautiful
daughters, Sienna and Milan.
Christmas is my favorite
time of year.
?Up high!
?Up high?
Sarah: The girls and I love
decorating the tree,
making Christmas cookies,
wrapping presents.
Good job!
The kids just love everything
to do with Christmas,
so we just kind of overdo it.
Did you get
Rudolph's footprint?
It's no surprise
that I have a business
that revolves around
my favorite holiday.
When doing research,
I found something online
that was similar to what
I wanted to do,
and I knew I could do it better.
Parents love this product ??
grandparents, aunts, uncles ??
'cause it gives lasting memories
every Christmas.
Get a seashell!
This year has been
really challenging
for me and my family.
My husband and I
are recently divorced,
so this is my first year
as a single mom.
Now being the only financial
provider of my household,
I have to make
this business work
so I can be a full?time mom
and a full?time entrepreneur
at the same time.
A deal from the Sharks
would definitely
make it the best Christmas ever.
Hi, my name is Sarah Blain,
and I'm from Delray Beach,
Florida.
I'm asking for $150,000 for 20%
equity in my company.
I have one of the coolest jobs
out there.
I work for...
Santa Claus.
[ Laughter ]
You're probably wondering ??
how does Santa respond
to all those letters
he receives each year?
Well, I'm about to let you in
on one of the North Pole's
best kept secrets ??
Sealed by Santa.
Myself,
along with my elf friends,
help Santa reply
to all those letters.
Each letter is personalized,
comes with magical
reindeer food,
comes with a red wax seal,
and if that's not all,
it also comes directly
from the North Pole.
And that's not all.
It also comes with a phone call
from Santa
and two video messages.
Let's see if the
big guy's available
for a video chat right now.
Yeah.
[ <i>Static</i> ]
Hey, Santa.
They sure are.
I was wondering if it's okay
if I gave them the letters
that you sent.
[ Light laughter ]
Hi, Santa!
[ Laughs ]
I knew that was gonna happen.
Great!
?Oh.
?Aw.
Thanks, Santa.
Hey, listen, bozo,
I'm litigating.
[ Laughter ]
I really hope you're on
your best behavior
so I can go back
to the North Pole
and give Santa
a good report.
So, who wants to be a part
of Santa's official team
and invest in
Sealed by Santa?
But first,
let me get your letters.
?Thank you, Sarah.
?There's one. Thank you.
?Lori, right from Santa.
?Thank you.
Thank you.
Shocking how they can fit coal
in one of those envelopes.
?[ Chuckles ]
?Look at my Nice list.
This is the envelope
you're mailing?
Yes.
Oh, Rudolph signed it,
too, Sarah.
Yes, he does.
So as you can see,
each letter is personalized
to you.
So what happens is, um,
a mother, father, grandmother,
aunt, best friend,
they'll go on our site,
and they'll tell us
about their child.
So there's accomplishments
on the letter,
wish list items,
of course, their name,
a customized P. S.,
so once we get that letter,
we get it printed out,
we put a red wax seal on it,
reindeer food, and it does ship
straight to the North Pole
to get approved by Santa
and postmarks back.
?It's so cute.
?Thank you.
"I see that you're hoping
for a new race car,
a pair of dancing shoes,
and maybe a pair
of swimming trunks
for your next vacation
with Kym.
Those sound like great gifts."
So cute.
Let's walk through
the business model.
?Okay.
?You're an online site.
Correct.
So what you're gonna do is
you're gonna go
onto the site,
and you're gonna pick
from 12 different letters.
So we offer, um,
Baby's First Christmas.
We offer teen letters.
We offer a Christian letter.
What does it cost you
to acquire a customer?
It cost me about $1.50.
And what's the customer worth?
Um, well, each letter
I sell for ??
a letter I sell for $10.95.
And it cost me
$1.25 to make,
and they go up to
different packages.
This is another really cool
thing about my business ??
I get that letter out
in 24 hours.
Oh, you do now 'cause you only
get a few thousand.
What happens if it blows up
and you get 100,000?
I'm happy you asked that.
Last year, I got 45,000.
?Oh, wow.
?And we did great.
?Wow.
So you did them all yourself?
Or you have little elves?
I have 12 elf friends that help
me during season.
What do they cost?
Um, last year, I spent $10,000
in, um, employment.
When did you start it, Sarah?
So I started this
10 years ago.
?Wow.
?Oh, 10 years.
But, um, I started it as
a hobby, and I had my kids.
I have a beautiful 6?
and 3?year?old little girl.
I call this a business
in the last five years.
What are your sales?
My sales last year
were $355,000.
?You did $355,000 last year?
?Correct.
With a net of $180,000.
And what ?? what did you do
the year before?
Before that,
we did $250,000.
?So great growth.
?When you grow the brand ??
So there ?? so really,
they're ??
Sealed by Santa can only
play out once a year.
You know what?
I'm happy you asked that
'cause I'm gonna show you
something else.
So in the last year ??
?Where'd she go?
We did is we started going
to other businesses.
So this is
our summer letter.
So what we do is Santa
actually goes on vacation
to south Florida ??
great for him.
And he puts in the letter
what the child needs
to work on to stay
on the Nice list.
So then, that took off.
So we started partying
with the Easter Bunny.
?Cute.
?How well is that selling?
Is that doing well now?
?This is our first year
we did it, and we did about
$15,000 for each one.
So what ?? so what I'm really
trying to do is
make this seasonal business
not seasonal anymore.
Do you have a database
of customers?
?I do. Yes.
?How many?
60,000.
?60,000?
?Yes.
Are you capturing the birth date
of the child?
Please tell me you are.
?I am not at this time.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
Sarah has one offer
on the table from Kevin
for her letters?from?Santa
business Sealed by Santa.
But he wants a third
of her company.
The offer's so good
you're crying?
[ Crying ] Yeah.
No, you know what?
Well, then take it.
Forget these guys.
I would, but,
unfortunately,
I am the sole winner
of my family [sniffles]
and I know
what I have to make.
So I really want to stick
as close to that $25,000
of that 25% as possible.
Herjavec: Sarah,
you said to Kevin's offer
that you have to make a certain
amount of money out of it.
How much money do you need
to pull out
of the business every year?
I mean, I'd take
a $60,000 revenue now,
but, um...
to be at that $100,000 is
kind of where I need to be.
?Got it.
?And ??
Well, you can just ask
for a salary.
Kevin, as part of this deal,
to give that equity,
I need a $100,000 salary.
Why won't you
just do that?
I might have to do that.
[ Laughs ]
O'Leary: Let me explain
how this works.
Let's assume you accept my deal
of 33 1/3%.
?Okay.
?And I put $150,000 capital in.
Herjavec:
Sarah, I like it.
I mean, I ?? I get your need
for a salary,
so, you know, Kevin said
you get 2/3, he gets 1/3.
Bye!
?Congrats, Sarah.
Bye!
Whew. Okay.
That was crazy.
I couldn't give up 33%
of my company.
I needed this for my kids,
and the deal that Lori made me
was a perfect deal
for my situation.
I was born and raised in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
My grandparents came over
from Russia.
Their name was Chabinsky.
And when they got
to Ellis Island,
they were like, "Nah."
Chop, chop, chop.
And it ended up being Cuban.
I grew up in
a working?class family.
My dad did upholstery on cars.
My mom did every type
of job imaginable.
People thought I might
go work at a mill.
My mom wanted me to learn
how to lay carpet
because she was concerned
about my future.
Nobody had high hopes for me,
but I was a hustler.
I've always been selling.
From reselling baseball cards
to stamps and coins,
[ Chuckling ] I always had
something going on.
That was just my nature.
Since college,
I've been a tech geek.
I had quit or been fired
from three straight jobs.
So I figured it was time
to start my own company.
And so I started MicroSolutions.
Back then, I'd take my floppy,
I walked over
to the other computer.
That's how we shared.
But I was like, "No,
it's all gonna be different
in the future."
So we started learning how to
connect our computers together.
In 1995, streaming didn't exist.
My partner and I had this idea
for being able
to listen to sports over this
new thing called the Internet.
From there, we started
broadcast. com.
We just saw this as
a unique opportunity
to combine sports with
the leading organization
on the Internet.
In April 2000,
we closed our deal with Yahoo!
for $5.7 billion
in Yahoo! stock.
Come on, Joey,
get your crew together!
I paid $285 million
for the Mavs.
Everybody said you're an idiot
because the Mavs suck
and that was the largest price
ever paid for any
sports team ever.
