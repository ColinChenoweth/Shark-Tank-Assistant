Hi, Sharks.
I'm Brad Bosvovic.
And I'm Charlie Williams, and
our company is Digiwrap, Inc.
We're seeking $150,000
for 10% of our company.
Digiwrap is the only company
in the world
taking gift bags
and tissue paper
to where it's never
been before.
Everyone does
the same thing ??
you take a boring, generic bag,
like that.
You wrap your gift in a plain
piece of tissue paper
that you put no thought into,
you stuff it in the bag,
Herjavec: Charlie,
where is the break point
to where a business can go
to a competitor?
You're almost living on the
fringe of the printing business.
And it's a really unique
problem you have
because, if you get
a customer,
and the customer becomes
too big,
they're not good for you.
You got to go find another one.
I think it works on sites
where this is part of something
else, like a Zazzle.
But for you to build
your own company
and acquire those customers,
I think it's gonna be
really tough.
