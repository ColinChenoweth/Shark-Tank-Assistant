You don't even need ice.
Corcoran: There you go.
Do a spin.
Narrator:
But not too much cheer.
?What are your sales?
?$15,000.
Your building is on fire.
?Hello.
?Oh!
?Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Last year,
we sold 350,000.
And if you don't want it,
I'm okay.
?[ Laughs ]
?Total sales, $1.3 million.
?That's really interesting.
?You are one ripped dude.
Ah. It's okay, Kevin,
don't feel bad.
I think we're gonna be able
to turn that around, Kevin.
I think we all saw that one
coming, right?
You know, I feel like
I've, I've done a lot
"If you want to get
something done,
give it to a single mom."
You're not gonna find somebody
with more drive
But don't you think
I can quadruple or ??
?I do, but ??
?Grow your business by 10 times?
I also know what I have to do
for my girls.
So, I'm gonna
think about it.
I want to hear the other ones,
but I think that ??
Sure.
We get close to that 25%
because ??
I don't see it as a business
that has room for an investor.
I don't want to tell you
what to do with it.
I expect you to put it to work
in the best way possible.
?Right.
?But we're partners.
As you withdraw capital,
What you've done, you know,
you should be proud of yourself.
?Thank you.
?That's a major accomplishment.
You know,
I see a couple red flags.
I really think you're trying
to do too much
by going to the different
holidays.
I think when you talk about
wanting to go into retail,
that shows a lack of focus.
I don't need that. I have a job
that already pays me money.
?[ Laughs ]
?So I'll give you
the $150,000 for 1/3 ??
33 1/3%.
You get to make $100,000.
We split the profit
above that.
So the first $100,000
goes to you,
I was like, "I don't care."
I got to go party with
the entire city of Dallas.
It was just a dream come true.
Since then, we've never
had a losing record.
Been to the conference finals
three times,
been to the finals twice,
and best of all,
you don't even need ice.
Let me show you how it works.
Loughran:
Here's what they don't have.
They don't have the scaled?down,
mini panels, which no one sells.
?The what?
?Small portions.
?Wow, nicely done. Bravo.
?Good job, Robert.
What are your sales?
Uh, total sales since I started,
$1.3 million.
Wow.
That's lifetime
for the 3 1/2 years.
?Jim, you don't know the answer?
?Is that $15,000?
I call you up,
I have a tennis court,
I want to turn it
into a rink.
What does it cost me?
Most people don't want
that large of a rink
just to skate at home.
?Well ??
?They need maybe ??
?But don't you ??
?100 square feet.
It should be,
"I have done."
You got to be aggressive
in order to be able to repay
an investor money
And I don't get that sense.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
No retailer's gonna bring 1,000
pounds of PolyGlide slabs,
'cause it takes up
too much space
but I don't see it scaling
as a product ??
particularly in retail ??
that's a really bad idea.
I'm out.
I respect that.
Thank you.
It's a clever idea,
but I like to invest in things
where I know it's gonna
hit a lot of people,
I don't see
the wide scale of it.
I'm out.
I respect that.
Thank you.
and you're done, right?
Wrong!
In a world that's gone
completely digital
and it's all done right here
in the good old U. S. of A.
Digiwrap is about making
gift packaging personal.
So, what do you say,
Sharks?
?Yeah.
?I don't buy that for a second.
If you wanted custom,
digital for tissue paper,
there in no one else.
So, then, how many millions
of dollars of sales
are you doing
with custom tissue paper?
We've only been in business
for two years,
It's a beautiful product,
but I don't see it going large.
I'm out.
Cuban:
Robert's point is right on.
It's gonna take so many deals
to get to a size
that really makes it
worthwhile to invest.
The challenge,
as an investor ??
I'd have to see a real
return because,
Corcoran: I don't believe
there's enough of a market
for customized tissue paper,
enough to warrant having
a partner in your business.
I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara,
we appreciate it.
Greiner:
Printing has come a long way.
This is really
excellent?looking.
but I think people also don't
like to spend a whole lot
on packaging because
people throw it away.
I'm out.
Well, thank you
for your time, Lori.
O'Leary: It's a unique niche,
I get what you're doing,
but I don't know how
to blow this up.
I mean,
the biggest thing is,
That's the only deal, and if
you don't want it, I'm okay.
You know, we could meet you
in the middle somewhere.
Hi, I'm Don Wildman,
I live in Malibu, California,
and now you don't have
to take you gloves off
to check your phone,
crack a beer.
Quickly gain full
five?finger dexterity
for whatever it is
you need to do,
or simply dump
excess heat.
and you don't have to take them
off to do it.
I don't want to go
ahead of 85 ??
I need all the help
I can get.
Jake's the young man,
so we're looking for some guys
that have some brainpower
that we can add to our team.
So, Don, I got to tell you,
you are one ripped dude.
Holy crap.
?Wow.
Are you really 85?
I'll be 84 in February.
I sort of hedged a little bit.
?Son of a gun.
?You are in amazing shape.
I've done the IRONMAN
nine times.
Herjavec: You've done
the IRONMAN nine times?
He won it once.
What company did you run
that got to over
a billion dollars?
A Bally's Fitness.
?Wow.
?Oh, really?
It was
a health?club chain.
We had 450 clubs at the end
of my reign.
Oh, yeah.
Huge company.
I'm gonna assume
you're a millionaire.
I'm worth about
$100 million, yeah.
Don, tell us a little bit
about your background.
You're in amazing shape,
you started Bally's.
I'm a typical guy.
I can identify with him
'cause I didn't graduate
from high school.
I started Bally's after
I got out of the army.
I was a combat medic
in Korea.
Wow.
I went to work for
a small health?club chain,
I think you have Don,
who I think, Don,
you're a good salesman.
?You got to talk loud.
I said, "Don,
you're a handsome man!"
Well, thank you.
[ Laughter ]
If I had some better ears
it'd be better.
Okay. Don, I said you're
a natural?born salesman,
I feel, so ?? I'm sure you've
been selling your whole life.
Jake, I don't think you are.
But I'm gonna
make you an offer.
But I want somebody else
in with me,
'cause I'm not gonna take
this amount of risk.
I'm gonna give you half
the money you're looking for,
for 12.5% equity,
but you have to get another
shark to come in
for the other half,
for a total of 25% equity.
Herjavec:
Don, you're one impressive guy,
I don't know how I can help it
get really big.
I'm out.
Cuban: I think it's a brilliant
glove, right?
I'll wear it, I'll tell people,
I'll show bit off, all right?
The challenge is putting
together a marketing plan
Corcoran:
Don, I offered you half of what
you were looking for here,
but you have to get
someone else in.
Don and Jake are seeking
for a 12.5% stake
?I'll tell you what, Don ??
?What?
I'll give you ?? if you want to
put your $300,000 in as capital,
I'll give you another $300,00
as a credit line
against cost of goods,
with 6% interest,
for 25% equity.
So, just so I'm clear ??
Don's got to put
in $300,000
to the company in terms
of equity.
?The current ??
?Yeah.
You'll put up $300,000
as a line of credit
against receivables.
But you want 25%.
Yes, Robert.
Barbara, we'd love
to take that deal.
?Yes!
?Good job, guys.
?Whoo!
?Well done.
?Easy, Don, easy.
?Don, I'm so happy to hear it.
?Uh?oh.
?Whoa!
Yeah!
[ Laughter ]
Corcoran: Lovely.
?That was fun.
?That was awesome, Wildman.
I think we got
the good deal.
Wildman:
We do feel proud of ourselves,
being able to tell people
that the Shark Tank
had enough faith in this
business to jump in.
