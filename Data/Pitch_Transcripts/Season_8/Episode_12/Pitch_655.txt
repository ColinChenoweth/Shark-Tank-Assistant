Hi, Sharks. Let me introduce
ourselves. I'm Tara.
Oh, they're freaks!
Tara: Oh, I'm not joking.
You're joking!
No. So, who wants
to join us
on the quest to improve
kitty lives around the world?
There is not ??
[ Laughter ]
Now ??
Now, Sharks ??
Somebody hands you ?? You need
to drop a mic right about now.
That is
horrible!
Tara: We're gonna give
each of you guys a cat
and a LICKI Brush and a SHRU
so you can test it out.
Oh, no, you're not!
Oh, yes, we are.
I want a cat.
What's the name
of the cat?
Chestnut.
Chestnut is now
psychologically disturbed.
Oh, my God.
[ Laughter ]
Robert,
if you could take a cat.
