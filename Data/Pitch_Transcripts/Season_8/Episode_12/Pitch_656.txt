My name is Laura Dweck.
And I'm Michael Dweck.
We're from New York City,
and the founders
of Basic/Outfitters.
We're seeking an investment
of $125,000
in exchange for 10%
of our company.
Did you know
that on average,
men keep their underwear
for seven years?
[ Greiner laughs ]
What?!
Let that "stink" in
for a second.
Seven years.
Embarrassingly enough, I was
a victim of this statistic.
Really? I was the victim
in that statistic.
When we first got married,
I would not put up with it.
Michael's socks, underwear,
and undershirts
were faded and holier
than the Pope on Easter Sunday.
So, I did
what needed to be done.
[ Laughter ]
I just wanted
a quick and easy way
to refill everything I had
in my drawers
without having
to burn a paycheck.
I couldn't find anything
to satisfy those needs,
so we created
the solution.
Basic/Outfitters is
an online destination for men
to refill their drawers
with high?quality basics
at affordable
price points.
You could choose
up to 10 pairs of socks,
three pairs of underwear,
three undershirts,
and a pair
of jogger sweat pants
all for $60.
That's the part where
people's jaws drop to the floor.
Yes, we just said $60
for up to 17 basics.
It's fast,
it's customizable,
it's high?quality,
and it's affordable.
So, sharks, who's ready to
put an end to that nasty stink?
We have some amazing drawers
to hand out to you guys.
All right, Mr. Wonderful.
Robert.
John: Thank you.
Ooh, thank you.
And we have some Mavs colors
in there for you.
?Appreciate it.
?Thank you.
?Feel those socks.
That's our basic drawer.
I'm a little blown away ??
17 items for $60?
Did I hear that?
Yes, up to 17 items, yes.
Do I have to buy
an annual subscription?
No, this is not
a subscription model.
Greiner:
So, you pick and choose online.
You go online, and then you see
what pack fits you.
Correct.
I do have to say this is
the softest, most amazing sock
I have ever felt
in my entire life.
This stuff is amazing.
Thank you.
This stuff is
really good quality.
Thank you.
I mean, it's so ??
It feels like cashmere!
Laura: Thank you.
How can you afford to sell it
at that price?
When we first started this,
we did some market research
to figure out what was
that sweet spot price
that would
wow customers.
We landed on $60.
So, we were relentless
in finding that price point
and working with
an amazing buying agency.
They found us
the factories.
So, I'm
one of those guys ??
The last time
I bought underwear
was when Elvis did that comeback
concert in Hawaii, right?
[ Laughter ]
So, I get it.
But, I'm in stores all the time
that have underwear.
So, if I'm
not purchasing it then,
why am I home
thinking about going online,
putting in my credit card,
finding where you are,
and waiting for it?
Good question.
So, the real idea
came from
when Laura and I
first got married.
She challenged me
to throw out
anything that I hadn't worn
in about three months.
I just wanted
a quick and easy way
that I can refill, and when
I went to the department stores,
socks were in one place,
underwear was in another.
The pricing was
all over the place.
They had the audacity
of charging me $28
for one pair
of underwear.
How am I
supposed to refill?
I am wearing right now
a pair of underwear
from Switzerland that cost $99,
hand?stitched
by Italian virgins.
[ Laughter ]
Okay, we learned that your price
selling point was great.
Yes.
But you never told us
your cost.
You're selling them for $60.
What's your cost on that?
It costs us, on average,
$25.90 to make a drawer.
What will
this year's sales be?
We're estimating
about $500,000.
So, what have you done
year to date,
and what have you done
the last twelve months?
You take that.
So, since we launched ??
I like the way she decides
what you're gonna say.
[ Laughter ]
I'm married, I know.
I'm not even
supposed to ask.
?You already know.
?That's the way it should be.
?And tell us when you will.
Laura and I launched the company
10 months ago.
Okay.
Since then, we've done
$351,000 in sales.
Wow!
How much inventory
in dollar amounts do you think
you'll end with
for this year projection?
So, right now, we still have
$397,000 in inventory.
Oh, so you went big
for your buy.
We went big.
Oh, wow!
Laura and I
invested $250,000
of our own life savings
into this.
Wow.
And how much
did you raise?
And we raised $750,000
in capital.
Wow, from who?
Feeling good.
We had outside investors
who really loved the idea,
and we were able to get
a million dollar valuation
on just concept alone.
And how much equity
do you have?
And where did
all that cash go?
We have 25% equity.
?You have 25% equity.
?Oh.
?Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
You gave away
75% of it already.
We did, because ??
[ Groans ]
Sorry, Laura,
you sold 75% of your business?
Narrator:
All sharks are still in.
They're impressed
with the price and quality
of Laura and Michael's
men's undergarment business,
Basic/Outfitters.
But the sharks are
surprised to learn
they already sold the majority
of their business
in order to get it started.
You sold 75% of your business
before you started?
Laura:
Let me explain.
When we started this,
there was huge potential
based on the market research
that we did.
So, we knew that there was this
pocket of opportunity
we knew that we could
capitalize on.
So, we wanted
to build something big.
Wow. That's tough.
Guys, look ??
market research is never right,
as you found out.
It's actually spot?on with what
our hypothesis was. We know ??
Then why would you spend
so much on inventory
and why would you give away
so much of your company
if you knew it was gonna
be right,
when all you'd have to do
is take your time to get there?
We wanted
to build the company.
We wanted to be
sitting on the inventory.
We also looked at ??
You wanted to be sitting on
all that inventory?
We wanted
to be prepared.
Oh.
We wanted to be prepared.
We also knew ??
We own ??
We made that mistake.
I feel you've been screwed
by the V. C. s, you know that?
Wedgied.
Well...
No, it's not that
you've been screwed.
You screwed yourself.
The vision's good.
The product's good.
The execution is
ridiculous.
Worst I've ever seen.
We're looking
for the long haul.
We're here because
we're building this thing
to be an empire.
We're not looking to sell it
at $10 million.
Yeah, I ??
We're looking
to go really big.
Yeah, but it's too late!
You blew it!
Capital management?wise,
you're the worst I've ever seen,
so I'm out.
And I'm not mad at you,
I feel bad for you,
that there's
this great opportunity
that you created,
and it went "Pshew!"
Well, I'm mad at you.
And that's why we're ??
That's why we're here today.
We want to make you
a lot of money.
You can't!
Herjavec:
No, but you can't!
We can!
Michael: You can't!
Guys, this is
a basic business.
Why can't we?
You know what, look.
Michael...
This is a basics business ??
$76 billion.
... great business,
great idea.
But you cannot make a mistake
that's gonna kill you.
When you give away 75%,
you're dead.
You don't own this business
anymore.
I'm not talking
to the owner.
I'm talking
to the hired help.
It's crazy.
I'm out.
So, guys,
I love this stuff.
The quality is amazing.
I just knew I could put
my Bombas socks in there,
and they have online,
and it was gonna be great,
but you don't have enough equity
in the company.
You're gonna be miserable here,
and when you dropped that bomb
of you not having
that percentage...
it just hurt me,
actually, for you.
So, I'm out.
Guys, I look at this, uh,
this problem a different way.
It doesn't make sense
to take any of your equity
if I were to be an investor.
Here's an offer for you.
I would give you $125,000.
I want 25%, but I want the whole
25% to come out of them.
I wouldn't do the deal if
you told me he was deluding you,
because if you don't have 25%,
you don't have skin in the game.
But how can they
make that deal, Kevin?
We're here
on their behalf.
You know,
I'll tell you something ??
When you came in ??
Guys, that's
an offer, okay?
Thank you.
I appreciate the offer.
Thank you.
You know, I love
to copy Mr. Wonderful.
I will do $125,000
for the 25% that
you get out of your investors.
I'm doing it because I think
that the product is fantastic.
So basically,
you've made the same offer.
I crafted
the deal for you.
I would love to ask
if either of you
would want to come down to...
15% for $125,000.
Because we are
negotiating for them.
We value them
as investors,
and we value you guys
as investors,
and we love the way
you're structuring,
and we appreciate
that you care.
O'Leary: I've just realized,
listening to you ??
you actually
can't make this deal.
I'm dealing with a ghost
that's not in the room,
and that's the problem
with your structure.
You simply don't own enough.
I'm out.
Appreciate it.
Can you even negotiate?
What you want to do,
Lori?
You're talking about somebody
else's equity.
I know you were
countering back at 15%.
I will go 20%,
but that's it.
And you really have to
think about
whether or not they would
even consider this.
Wouldn't do it, Lori.
Let's make a deal.
Let's make a deal.
?20%?
?But how can they do the deal?
?But you have to check with your
investors first.
You have to check
with your investors.
You don't have the right
to make the deal!
We have the right.
We're here with their blessing.
So you think that your investors
are going to say,
"It's okay ?? 20%. I will
give it away out of my cut."
100%.
You're positive?
We're not ??
We're not positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.
?Really?
?Oh.
?Ah.
?There you go.
O'Leary: They've said yes.
What do you want to do?
Well,
what does that mean?!
It's Lori's call.
Look, it's Lori's call.
I mean, Lori...
Lori, I think it would
close with a lot more certainty
if we could get this equity down
a little bit more.
?Oh!
?Oh, my ?? Gaah!
?Okay! Okay! Okay!
?All right, I'm sorry.
Greiner: You know what?
We really ??
This seems very tenuous.
We're ??
We really ??
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to go out.
We really want
to make a deal with you.
To make that deal,
you needed 51%.
Yep.
You're an employee,
both of you.
No, we're here
with their s??
You're here,
but you're still employees.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for listening.
We appreciate it.
Appreciate all your time.
Wow. You could feel
the air leave the tank...
Boom.
... as soon as they said
they sold 75%.
Yeah, I could see ?? I was
hitting her with this stuff,
I could see her face
just start to drop.
That kind of made me sick.
Michael:
We don't think it's a mistake
that we gave up 75%
of our company.
We have 25% of a company
that's going to be huge.
And we're
really proud of that.
In season six,
Naushad Ali made a deal
with Robert Herjavec
for his clogged drain solution,
Drain Strain.
$110,000,
but I want 10%.
I'd love
to do a deal with you.
Done!
Narrator:
Let's see what he's doing now.
Hey, Naushad,
how are you?
Ali:
When I appeared on "Shark Tank,"
Drain Strain was just
a prototype.
We launched it retail
just three months ago,
and we're generating
tremendous sales and interest.
So, we got the Drain Strain
sink stopper.
I love the packaging.
In 2008, my family lost
everything including our home,
and we ended up moving
into a rental.
It was ironically
in that rental home
that our drains clogged
and was the eureka moment
for Drain Strain.
You've come a long way,
my friend.
Since "Shark Tank,"
we're now available
in 1,200 Home Depot stores,
and we have a purchase order
for 500 Lowe's stores.
When I was on "Shark Tank,"
we were pre?revenue.
We've launched in retail
just three months ago
and generated $. 5 million
in sales.
And then
here's our bathtub prototype.
Herjavec:
What I've learned from Naushad
is this is the greatest country
in the world.
Everybody gets a second chance
if you're willing to work hard.
Naushad was at rock bottom,
and a few years later,
he's in 1,200 Home Depot stores?
Hallelujah.
Look at that.
Right at the end of an aisle.
This is just the beginning.
Today, Drain Strain ?? tomorrow,
every drain in your house
with an entire
Drain Strain section.
I can see it.
The only thing left to do
is get more locations.
Well, let's do it.
Let's go work on that.
Ali: My family has endured
a lot of emotional
and financial challenges
over the last several years.
This has allowed me
to bounce back
and make my dreams come true
and leave a legacy
for my children.
