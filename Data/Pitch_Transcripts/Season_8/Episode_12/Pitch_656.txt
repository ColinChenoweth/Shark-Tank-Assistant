My name is Laura Dweck.
I mean, it's so ??
It feels like cashmere!
Laura: Thank you.
How can you afford to sell it
at that price?
When we first started this,
we did some market research
to figure out what was
that sweet spot price
that would
wow customers.
Sorry, Laura,
you sold 75% of your business?
Narrator:
All sharks are still in.
Laura:
Let me explain.
When we started this,
there was huge potential
based on the market research
that we did.
So, we knew that there was this
pocket of opportunity
we knew that we could
capitalize on.
So, we wanted
to build something big.
Wow. That's tough.
Guys, look ??
market research is never right,
as you found out.
It's actually spot?on with what
our hypothesis was. We know ??
Then why would you spend
so much on inventory
We can!
Michael: You can't!
Guys, this is
a basic business.
Why can't we?
You know what, look.
Michael...
This is a basics business ??
$76 billion.
... great business,
great idea.
But you cannot make a mistake
that's gonna kill you.
When you give away 75%,
you're dead.
You don't own this business
anymore.
I'm not talking
to the owner.
I'm talking
to the hired help.
It's crazy.
I'm out.
So, guys,
I love this stuff.
The quality is amazing.
I just knew I could put
my Bombas socks in there,
Michael:
We don't think it's a mistake
that we gave up 75%
of our company.
We have 25% of a company
that's going to be huge.
