Hello, sharks.
My name is Cade Courtley.
This is Ms. Betty Bean.
Courtley: Yeah.
You know what?
He's a former sniper.
He over it.
He's used to risk.
I mean, you know.
Cade, Cade, Cade.
We're gonna save you some time.
I'm gonna save you
some time, right?
Yes, sir.
Rule number one
to "Shark Tank" is
when you talk about
market size...
Mm?hmm.
?That's scary for us.
?Yeah, we hate that, Cade.
?That's ?? Yeah.
Yeah, that's a big red flag
because it does everything
but put the focus
on your business
O'Leary: So, you're only
buying beans from a ??
They're roasters, Cade.
?You yourself ??
?They actually ??
?No, no, he's going
through the roaster.
You're not buying
the coffee directly.
So, what you're really creating
is a marketing company.
You're right.
The coffee's
the same coffee
that you can get
from other people.
Cade, how
do you scale that?
Because most of the coffee
bought in corporations
is done
through third parties.
I'm glad you asked.
One of the things
I want to create
is what I call
the Victory Army.
You're trying to do
too much, Cade.
You're trying
to do too much.
Yeah, you're ??
These are all ideas.
You haven't executed them yet.
I'm just trying to sell.
I know. I know.
I'm just trying to sell.
You're a great
salesperson, right?
You've got the heart.
You've got the determination.
But what you don't have
is focus right now.
You can sell. You believe.
You've got the heart.
You know you're doing
the right thing.
That is an amazing skill
that not everybody has.
Just do that.
Mm?hmm.
Everything else is
a complication. Just sell.
Okay.
I'm out.
You know, you picked coffee
because it's popular,
It's not investable
yet, Cade.
I'm out.
All right, thank you.
Cade, do you know
what the number 242 is?
Courtley: I will survive
in the coffee industry
