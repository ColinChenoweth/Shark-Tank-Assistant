Hello, sharks.
My name is Cade Courtley.
This is Ms. Betty Bean.
And I'm here asking for $250,000
for 20% equity.
Now, as a former Navy Seal,
a sniper,
and a security contractor,
I worked in some of
the most hostile places
on this planet.
Places like Bosnia, places like
Iraq and Afghanistan ??
the kind of places
you're literally living
one hour at a time.
And things can go upside?down
just like that.
Trust me when I tell you
when you're working
in an environment like that,
you crave just
a little sense of normalcy.
Now for me, that was
a damn good cup of coffee.
And that's why
I started Victory Coffees.
That, and it beats the hell out
of getting shot at.
[ Laughter ]
Now, Victory Coffees is
a veteran?owned
and veteran?operated company
whose only mission is
to deliver you amazing coffee.
Simply choose
one of our organically grown,
fairly traded,
premium international blends.
You can get it in whole bean.
You can get it ground.
And we are proud to announce
that we have
the world's strongest K?Cups.
Thank you, Betty.
[ Laughter ]
And that's it!
So, folks,
life is too short,
so why not start your day
with a victory?
Now, Ms. Betty Bean
is going to deliver you each
two cups of coffee.
The one that you prefer,
if you wouldn't mind
slipping that mug forward,
please.
Herjavec:
I love coffee.
We have your initials
on the front of each mug.
Oh, thank you.
Betty Boop.
I like this one.
O'Leary:
You're taking a lot of risk with
this blind taste test thing.
Courtley: Yeah.
You know what?
He's a former sniper.
He over it.
He's used to risk.
I mean, you know.
There is coffee risk, and then
there's getting blown up risk.
So, the one in the white cups ??
that's one of the country's
leading coffee sellers in that.
So, the folks that said,
"Hey, we like the gray one."
We have a better product
than one of
the biggest coffee companies
in the United States right now.
Okay, I chose the gray,
which is yours, darker.
Yes, sir.
Lori?
Greiner: I do think that yours
has a nicer flavor
for being a very heavy,
dark coffee.
Kevin,
what did you choose?
I chose the darker cup,
the gray cup, as you did.
'Cause you're a connoisseur
like I.
Of course.
Daymond?
I'll be very honest.
I tried them both,
and because I'm ?? I mean,
I'm not a coffee drinker,
I can't tell the difference.
And Mark?
I like mine light.
I don't like real heavy, dark,
dark coffee at all.
Where's the coffee
come from?
So, we source from Central
and South America,
Africa, and Sumatra.
So, what made you choose
to go into something
that has such
a competitive field?
Well...
Was it Betty Bean?
[ Laughter ]
I would tell you ??
I would tell you
that 83% of Americans
are drinking the stuff,
so I'm looking at
potentially
268 million customers,
and 56% of those folks admit
to being addicted to it.
Cuban:
Yeah. Okay, so, before...
Cade, Cade, Cade.
We're gonna save you some time.
I'm gonna save you
some time, right?
Yes, sir.
Rule number one
to "Shark Tank" is
when you talk about
market size...
Mm?hmm.
... and start to suggest, "If I
only get a small percentage,
then I'm gonna make a killing,"
that's like ??
?That's scary for us.
?Yeah, we hate that, Cade.
?That's ?? Yeah.
Yeah, that's a big red flag
because it does everything
but put the focus
on your business
and the execution
of your business.
Okay.
So, much more importantly is not
what's the size of the market,
because we know
people drink coffee.
What's the size
of your business?
Let me tell you
how Victory's different with ??
Let's say you have two cups.
It's the exact same price,
exact same quality,
exact same convenience.
But why is your ??
What's my differentiator?
Yeah.
Do not underestimate the power
of patriotism in this country.
But that gets you
in the door, right?
Yeah.
Thank you
for your service.
I don't want
to diminish that,
'cause there's
nothing more ??
You were worth it.
Yeah, there's nothing
more important.
But on the busi??
Now, back to
the business side of it.
Okay, you're
gonna get in the door.
Then what happens?
I just got
a major purchase order
from one of the biggest
insurance agencies
in this country.
So, what you're ??
what you're telling us is
you're selling
on a direct commercial basis
to large companies.
That's the business?to?business
side of the house.
I initially began this company
as the business?to?consumer,
and it was basically
a subscription?based
coffee company.
Online?
Yes, sir.
And how did you do?
What are your sales?
We have year?to?date sales
right now
of $30,000,
$0 advertising.
That's direct to consumer?
Yes, it is.
And that's over
what period of time?
That's over a period
of eight months.
Okay,
let's really drill down
into what you
actually have created,
because I'm going to
make the assumption ??
because I'm familiar
with the whole sourcing
of coffee business ?? You're not
<i>really</i> sourcing it yourself.
You're dealing
with a distributor.
I'm not, I went directly
to two of my Marine buddies
who set up shop
in Washington, D. C.,
and have been making coffee
for about three years.
O'Leary: So, you're only
buying beans from a ??
They're roasters, Cade.
?You yourself ??
?They actually ??
?No, no, he's going
through the roaster.
You're not buying
the coffee directly.
So, what you're really creating
is a marketing company.
You're right.
The coffee's
the same coffee
that you can get
from other people.
And you're absolutely right,
and that's why I was able
to get three major corporations
to decide,
"We're going to switch to this."
Cade, how
do you scale that?
Because most of the coffee
bought in corporations
is done
through third parties.
I'm glad you asked.
One of the things
I want to create
is what I call
the Victory Army.
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to recruit,
train, equip, and deploy
an all?veteran sales force.
And this is how
we're gonna scale.
And it's basically iconic
American businesses for ??
You're trying to do
too much, Cade.
You're trying
to do too much.
Yeah, you're ??
These are all ideas.
You haven't executed them yet.
I'm just trying to sell.
I know. I know.
I'm just trying to sell.
You're a great
salesperson, right?
You've got the heart.
You've got the determination.
But what you don't have
is focus right now.
You can sell. You believe.
You've got the heart.
You know you're doing
the right thing.
That is an amazing skill
that not everybody has.
Just do that.
Mm?hmm.
Everything else is
a complication. Just sell.
Okay.
I'm out.
You know, you picked coffee
because it's popular,
and you know that there's
a good market for it.
But the double?edged sword is
is that at the same time,
there's a million people
out there making coffee
and selling coffee.
They own the market.
I always say
it's best to do something
that's a little bit different.
I'm out.
I appreciate what you say
about how competitive
and tough this is.
Sharks, I spent half of my life
making bad guys go away.
There's no way I'm gonna do
an attitude shift
from surviving
countless operations
in places like Afghanistan,
and give up
because somebody might not like
my light roast.
That's just not the way
I do business.
It is not even ?? It is not even
a question of that.
It's not a question
of your character.
Uh?huh.
Not at all.
It's not a question
of your character.
There is
no issue with you
making sure that you're gonna
get the job done.
But you're just
a little too early ??
Maybe I can explain
a little bit more about ??
You're gonna have to explain
to them. I'm out.
Thanks for your time.
O'Leary: Look ??
Yes.
Everybody said
the same thing.
Nobody doubts you,
it's just way to early.
It's not investable
yet, Cade.
I'm out.
All right, thank you.
Cade, do you know
what the number 242 is?
And I love this.
I love this story.
I learned this
a long time ago.
No, I don't.
That's the amount
of venture?capital firms
that Howard Schultz
went to
before he got funding
for Starbucks.
Who would've had the courage
to get up a 243rd time?
Nobody doubts
your character.
It's what you do with the
rejection today going forward.
I'm out today, but I wish you
all the best of luck.
Thank you very much.
Crush it, buddy.
Greiner:
Thanks for your service.
Herjavec: Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye, Betty Bean.
[ Laughs ]
Good luck.
Thanks, guys.
O'Leary:
That's a good brand.
Courtley: I will survive
in the coffee industry
the same way I survived
in Iraq and Afghanistan.
I will be better, quicker,
and smarter,
and I will crush
the competition.
