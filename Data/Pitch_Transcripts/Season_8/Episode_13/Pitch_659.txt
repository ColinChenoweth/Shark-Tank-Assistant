Hi.
My name is Latangela Newsome.
I live in Allen, Texas.
?Word.
And I'm seeking $75,000
in exchange for a 25% equity
in my company.
Now, I'm a woman
of many talents.
But one that I'm very noted for
is my home cooking,
and I throw down.
I'm also a single mom
to a growing boy,
and his all?time favorite meal
are my deep?fry chicken wings.
Mmm.
?I love chicken wings.
The problem is, what do you do
with all that grease
when it's clean?up time?
It's a pain in the butt.
Some of us just pour it
in an old coffee can,
which
should really be recycled.
Or even worse, some of us
just pour it down the drain.
[ Gasp ] The horror!
[ Laughter ]
Drain clogs due to grease
buildup are a costly nuisance.
Cities are wasting hundreds
of thousands of dollars
on pipeline replacements
due to fats, oils, and grease.
Environmental agencies
are screaming for responsible
grease disposal at home.
So, being the superwoman
that I am,
I set out
to find a new alternative.
Introducing Grease Bags.
[ Laughter ]
They are convenient,
disposable,
and even the packaging
is home compostable.
Just open it up, take your
grease, and it pour it in.
You watch your oil absorb
like magic.
So it'll never bother you again,
or clog up those pipes.
I am now the only person
with an eco?friendly product
for at?home grease disposal.
I am a monster?preneur.
If you open up the door,
I walk in and sell it.
So, who's ready
to invest in me
so we can get cooking
with grease?
?Can we see any samples?
?Sure!
I have some handouts
for you guys.
Please.
Do you have
any of your chicken wings?
?I do!
?Yes!
I thought about it.
It never hurts to feed
a hungry Shark, now.
Here you go, Robert.
And Lori, I will let you grab
one of my prototypes as well.
Here you go, Mr. Wonderful.
?Thank you.
Oh!
Wow, that is really good.
?Do you like that chicken?
?How good is this?
Well, thank you, Robert,
I appreciate that.
This is really good.
Latangela, what happened to that
grease when it went in the bag?
Well, we have a blend
of all?natural
oil?absorbing ingredients.
And so, what happens is
the pad inside that bag
is absorbing the oil.
Let me show you something.
Here is oil and water.
So, you can see the separation?
Yep.
Okay, so if I pour this
absorbent right over the top...
Is that the same material
that's in the bag?
Yes, it is.
It's encapsulating
and absorbing this oil.
When I pour this water
into this container here,
the water's gonna be clear.
You see that?
?Oh, wow.
So yeah, you see
there's no oil in there.
Good for you.
?Good for you.
?So that way...
What's the absorbent
made of?
I can't tell you all my secrets,
Robert!
But it's basically all?natural.
This stuff, I'll tell you ??
this stuff right here
is used in oil spills.
So, it's safe for the plants,
it's safe for animals...
Smart.
... they use it
for bioremediation.
I guess what I'm really
asking...
Sure.
...is, there anything
proprietary
about the material
in the bag?
Yes,
I have a patent pending.
Not the material in the bag ??
the combination
of the bag and the pad.
So, have you started selling
these yet, Latangela?
Not yet.
What I'm doing
is I found a manufacturer
and they are on the cusp
of this packaging.
?I need to know the price.
?Sure.
What we're planning on doing is
selling three at at a time.
People buy them, you know,
once a month.
And they'll be $12.99.
?For three.
?For three bags?
?For three bags.
?What does it cost you?
?$2.34 for three bags.
So your margin is huge.
Well, right now
because we're in the beginning,
I don't know
what all of my costs will be.
And I sort of set it
so that we wouldn't run into
any issues right now.
That's smart.
?This is a prototype?
?Yes.
The bag itself is a prototype.
?I will share something.
I have honestly
never fried anything.
?Why?
?I just ?? I eat healthy.
I don't eat fried foods.
I have almost zero knowledge
about this.
?Mm?hmm.
?And, so for that reason,
I'm out.
Corcoran: Well,
I have a lot of knowledge
'cause I make bacon
every single morning.
When I have that bag
already half filled,
and I take my hot bacon grease,
can I pour it into that bag?
As of now,
it's not heat tempered.
Oh.
You need to let that grease cool
down just a little bit.
?Huge problem.
?Well, because that would be,
I think, a large use
that so many people
would have for that bag.
I'm afraid I'm out.
Can you fix that, Latangela?
To make it heat tempered?
Yes, I just wanna keep the bag
home compostable
so that it doesn't, um,
add waste to our landfills.
So that's your trade?off ??
making it compostable
versus heat tempered.
Right.
This, I think,
is a little flawed.
It's gonna leave too much
of a market unavailable.
It has to be a foil package.
Then it wouldn't be
compostable.
It would be able to take
the hot grease from bacon.
That's ??
that's 50% bigger market.
Look, there's
an inherent conflict...
Mm?hmm.
...in that the people
who are very green conscious
are gonna be your consumer.
Right.
Those typically are people
that are more health conscious,
and I don't think
are doing as much frying.
And so, I think that's gonna
create your biggest challenge.
And for those reasons,
unfortunately, I'm out.
?I hate to hear that, Mark.
?I know, I hate ?? I always...
Because I really,
I really, really disagree.
I really think that people
are going to use this.
It's an oil?absorbing product,
so even if you're changing
your oil at home on your car,
you can use it for that.
You can use it
for oil?based paints.
I'm gonna give you an 8.62
for presentation skills.
?How 'bout a 10 plus!
?Thank you.
Oh, she gave you a 10!
The trouble with this product
is, I would never use it.
I cook bacon.
It's not gonna solve for me.
I'm out.
I hate to hear it,
Mr. Wonderful.
I disagree with Kevin.
I wouldn't give you an 8.6
out of 10.
I'd give you
a 10 out of 10.
Amazing presentation.
?Thank you, I appreciate that.
This is a really tough one.
When we have this much doubt,
you know what I rely on?
Sales.
?I understand.
I don't have that yet,
but I am so ??
like I told you guys,
I'm a monster?preneur.
In months I've gone
from filing a patent
to finding manufacturers
to finding all the supplies.
I have everybody in place.
Oh, no, there's not doubt ??
you are a force of nature.
Oh, I have done it.
I've hit the road running,
Robert.
I'm telling you,
the environmental agencies ??
they are really trying
to get people to understand...
Okay, Latangela, stop selling.
He's gotta make up his mind.
Latangela, too much unknown
with the product.
Believe in you, but...
I'm out.
Oh.
So, is that everybody?
By the way, best chicken
I've ever had, thank you.
Thank you.
I went out so fast earlier.
Let's pretend it didn't happen.
?Whoa!
?Wow.
Okay, awesome.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.
$12.99 for three bags
I think
is just way, way, way too much.
Could you sell this for $6.99
for three bags?
I think we can do that,
because it costs us ??
each bag
is 78 cents to make.
Okay, I'll tell you what.
On that contingency that you
could cut the price in half,
I'll give you the money,
all right?
But I want 50%
of the business.
Barbara, I appreciate
that so much.
And I have to say...
...that I will take that deal.
?Yes?
?Yes!
?Yay!
?And you know,
in your spare time I'm gonna
have you sell real estate.
Oh, whatever you need me to do.
I'll walk in and sell it.
Cuban: Way to crush it,
Latangela. Congrats.
?Thank you.
?Wow.
?Good job.
?Goodbye, thank you.
?Yo, wrong door.
?Oh, sorry!
[ Laughter ]
I'm so excited!
I can't believe it!
[ Crying ]
She really believed in me.
And I love Barbara,
and I think she's gonna be
an awesome partner.
I'm so grateful.
I can't wait to tell my son!
