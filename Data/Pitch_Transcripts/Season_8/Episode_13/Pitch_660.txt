My name is Vlad, and I live
in Brooklyn, New York.
Originally,
I'm from Kiev, Ukraine.
I was a curious little child.
I would always wonder around
taking things apart,
sometimes not put them
back together.
The world was my playground.
Unfortunately,
my dad passed away
and we literally
lost everything.
My grandparents
immigrated to New York,
and my mom and I
followed soon after.
How is your business?
Going good.
I don't have an office
for my business.
I live in
a one?bedroom apartment
with my grandparents
and my mom and the cat.
So a lot of times,
I just go to a local café,
and I work from there.
Kids are gonna love this.
Creativity was a really big part
of my childhood.
I really wanted to have
a product
that puts learning
to playtime.
Smolyanskyy:
That's you and dad!
Yeah.
We're in Paris together.
The hardest part
about coming to New York
was seeing my mom
adapt all by herself
with my dad not being around.
I felt like I needed to be
the man in the family
and support my mom
and make her happy.
And that's why I work so hard
to make this business a success.
My name is Vlad,
and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
I'm the founder and the creator
of Pinblock building blocks.
And I'm here seeking $100,000 in
exchange for 20% of my company.
Sharks! The future of our
children is in big trouble!
Millions of parents
are making one big mistake.
They value school
more than playtime.
You see, in school your children
are bogged by rules.
They memorize
and recite all day long.
But playtime at home
is when the self?exploration
and the self?development
actually takes place.
It is then your little Sharks
develop creativity,
decision?making skills,
all the things that are really
important for their success.
Every day, more and more parents
realize this,
and give their children
the ultimate creative toy ??
building blocks.
And that's
why I created Pinblock,
which requires no manual,
and every single piece
is exactly the same.
The long, round pins
on top of each block
allow your models to bend
and even fold.
Kevin, I said every single piece
is exactly the same,
so it allowed me to take
your beautiful face...
O'Leary: Yes.
... pixelate it,
and make a real?life mural.
Extremely attractive.
So Sharks, I need your help
to unlock the creativity
of our children
and watch them build the future
one Pinblock at a time.
And now, guys, I've got
some personalized gifts.
How about I give them out?
Robert.
You're the protector
of the cyber space.
You'll be our warrior for today.
?Ooh, I love it.
?Don't forget your dagger.
?Dagger?
Very cool!
Lori, Queen of QVC,
but you forgot your crown.
Thank you.
And a staff for you
to rule with.
Lots of present.
Kevin, I've brought some
Pinblock cash for you.
I like that, very cute.
Barbara, I got some really cool
accessories for you.
Oh, good.
I hope they're pure diamonds.
Let me help you out.
And a crown.
Cuban:
I get pizza? [ Laughs ]
I promise
the pizza's gluten?free.
That's what Mark is known for ??
eating.
?What are your sales?
?Yeah.
So, for sales we have 160K from
Amazon and from our website.
?Can I see your box real quick?
?Sure, certainly.
So, this is just
one of my different sets.
Thank you.
What does it cost, Vlad?
So, that one is
our start?up pack ?? $19.95.
How much does it cost you
to make?
It cost me $3.00.
With this starter pack,
what can I make?
That one in particular
actually comes with a manual,
but after that a kid
can go on our YouTube channel ??
learn from my tutorials
that I make myself.
So, what about Toy Fair?
Have we been to Toy Fair?
?Yes. January last year.
?Yep.
So, over there we got
great responses.
We're just showing
the prototype. We're...
What happened with Walmart?
What happened with Costco?
What happened
with Toys "R" Us?
With the big?box retailers,
they're generally not there
to seek out new products.
I sold them just one
from meeting to meeting.
And they loved it like,
"Yeah, this is really cool.
Send us a sample."
So you didn't get
any orders, then?
No. I took some orders
from smaller retailers, but...
Vlad, I'm dying to know
your background.
Where do you come from?
?Originally, I'm from Ukraine.
And actually, my father ??
he gave me a lot of inspiration.
He was into venture capital
and currencies.
Did he help fund
this business?
Unfortunately,
very early on he passed away.
Which kind of put me
in the position
where everything we had ??
my mom and I had ??
was taken away from us.
So, I ??
it's crazy to think about it,
but since I was a little boy
I knew that I had a mission
to get it all back.
To kind of ?? for my father,
to succeed him, you know?
To also become successful,
to continue his journey.
So by the time I started this
business, I was 18 years old.
So you came here wanting
to live the American Dream?
That's exactly it.
How old are you now,
if you don't mind my asking?
21, just turned.
?Wow.
?Wow!
Did you start this business?
Did you raise any money?
No, we didn't raise
any money.
I started this
with my best friend at the time,
and we together pulled our money
and we financed the prototype,
the production.
?What happened to the friend?
Uh, my partner
was in the back end,
and I feel like he didn't feel
connected to the business.
So, does he still own
part of it?
?He still owns 15%.
?15?
15, one?five.
So I own the rest ?? 85.
?And he's not there anymore?
?No, he's not there.
Now Vlad, there are other blocks
I can create stuff like this.
?I disagree.
?Not bendable.
Actually, I would ask, "Would
you be able to make a crown?
Would you be able to make
a watch?"
?And do you have a patent on it?
?Yes, I applied for two patents,
and yesterday got
my design patent granted.
Good for you.
So, the design is
of the shape of the piece.
The design is exactly
how the piece looks.
That.
?Yes, that.
?That's useful.
O'Leary: I have to admit,
this is interesting
because it does a few things ??
the bendability
plus the pixelation artwork
is kind of different.
You know, years ago
I sold my company to Mattel,
and I worked there
for a year and a half
and I got a pretty good dose
of the understanding
of the toy industry.
I'm gonna make you an offer.
The only way I see
for this to work
is that you actually partner
with another toy company
that's going to get this
into their product line.
They would probably license it
in perpetuity,
pay you a royalty.
I would do that deal,
but I want 30%.
In other words,
I'll give you the 100K
with a giant contingency.
I have no interest
in investing in this
unless I can put it into
a very large toy manufacturer
that provides marketing
and distribution globally.
This is actually something
that goes against
my original strategies.
My strategy is to really
build on the brand
where it's a necessity
for these big retailers
to carry my product,
because they have kids coming
into the front door and asking,
"Hey, where's Pinblocks?"
Vlad, everything
you just outlined,
you made it sound as
though as it's a very
easy thing to accomplish.
I'm sure you're aware it's gonna
take a heck of a lot of money.
I don't typically
like the deals he offers,
but with his experience,
I think that's a deal
you should consider.
So I'm out.
Greiner:
Vlad, in the toy space
it's very difficult
to make the consumer understand
a completely new product
like this.
It's a long road.
I'm out.
Herjavec: Vlad, look.
I always think great businesses
are built from great purpose.
I can just tell that's you.
I would try to license it,
but that's not your vision.
I wish you all the best.
But, I'm out.
Vlad, what you're doing
is incredible, right?
You're grinding through,
and there's a lot of
really amazing things
that you've accomplished.
But the toy business is brutal.
This isn't something for me.
I'm out.
?I made you an offer.
?Yes.
And the risk you have
when that occurs is,
you can see if there's another
one, or you can engage in mine.
And now,
you only have one option.
That gives me
a lot more leverage.
So, I'm gonna modify
my offer.
The only way this works is ??
I'm gonna 50/50 partner
with you.
?Oh!
?Wow!
Narrator: Vlad had one offer
on the table from Kevin
for 30% of his building toy,
Pinblock.
But with all the other Sharks
dropping out,
now Kevin
wants 50% of his company.
The only way this works is ??
I'm gonna be a 50/50 partner
with you.
I'll give you $100,000
for 50% with contingency.
I'll bring it
to the toy industry,
because
they all return my call.
And I'll bring deals to you.
And if you want to turn them
down, that's fine.
But if you want to accept
one of them, we're 50/50.
You have no chance of doing
this successfully yourself.
So, your first offer was
for 30%...
And then you dropped out,
Robert.
And then you dropped out,
Lori.
No Vlad, actually, that's
not as bad as you first think.
Which part of bad is not as bad
as you think, the 50%?
Because he gave Vlad ??
no, he gave Vlad the option.
So you can set the bar
as high as you want
for that deal you like,
and then basically,
he's paying you to be
a sales rep and a partner,
a 50/50 partner.
One by one,
these Sharks dropped out
because they don't wanna
take on the task.
I happen to
come from this industry,
so I'm willing to give it
a shot.
But you're still in control.
This is your one shot
to get in the board room of
the biggest players on Earth.
Vlad, you should
take this offer.
This is a good deal for you.
?[ Sighs ]
You know what,
stop telling him what to do.
I don't own the entire 100%.
I own 85.
So you, by taking 50%,
you're becoming the sole driver
of the company.
I want 50% of it.
How do you split up your 50%,
Vlad, is entirely up to you.
Vlad, do you think
you can do it alone?
This is
what it comes down to.
Do you feel like
you need that help?
?Thanks, Vlad.
?Smart man, Vlad.
?Wow.
?Congrats, Vlad.
I didn't think
that was gonna happen.
Congratulations.
Vlad, Vlad, the moral is ??
Kevin thought he was making
a better deal, you won.
?Thank you.
?Congratulations.
Thank you, guys.
?Take care, Vlad.
?Congrats.
Kevin does take a big chunk
of my company.
I am the ?? not the majority
stake holder anymore.
He is. Sucks.
But I do have a Shark on my
team, which is very valuable.
And I really am excited
to see where this takes us.
At the end of it all,
how many 21?year?olds can say
that they have Kevin O'Leary
as a partner?
