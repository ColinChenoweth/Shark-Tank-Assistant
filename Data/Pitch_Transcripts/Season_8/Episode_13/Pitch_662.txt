My name's Elena Petzold and I'm
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Whoo?hoo! [ Laughs ]
?[ Laughs ]
I am the creator
of Mama's MilkBox,
and today I'm seeking $200,000
for 20% of my company.
Sharks, take a look at my
beautiful ladies right here.
Don't they look amazing?
Aren't their outfits
spectacular?
And guess what else.
They are breast?feeding moms
who are able nurse their baby
on demand
or pump at a moment's notice.
Mama's MilkBox delivers
breast?feeding style
right to the door.
We're a nursing apparel
subscription service,
and for only $29 a box.
First, our subscribers
complete a style profile.
Based on that profile,
our breast?feeding stylists
hand?select nursing tops
and dresses to match.
We then send that
curated shipment to their house,
where they have three days
to try on the clothes
in the comfort and privacy
of their own home.
After three days,
they keep what they want,
and then they mail back
the rest.
We take that $29 styling fee
and we apply it as a credit
to any of their keeps,
and then we automatically
schedule their next shipment
for delivery in six weeks.
In the breast?feeding world,
we call breast milk liquid gold.
Who wants to get in on the
liquid gold rush with me?
[ Laughter ]
The breast?feeding world.
[ Laughing ] Right?
You are looking at the queen
of breast?feeding fashion.
What I did
for your sample shipments
is I tried to envision
your style profile.
Lori, I know you love a play on,
like, structure.
Barbara, you're normally
bright?colored,
so there's a couple
of bright pieces in there.
I think this would look good
on me.
?[ Laughs ]
?I don't judge. Go for it.
So, if I heard you correctly,
you charge me $29 a month,
but that's
just the curating fee.
Yes.
So in your example,
is this box arrives
and I say,
"Wow, I want to buy this."
I then have to purchase it.
?You just keep it...
?Right.
?... and then send back
whatever in that box
you don't you want.
So I send these back ??
How do I pay you for this one?
We automatically bill you.
And then, you get a 10% discount
if you keep it all.
So, all you're doing is
you're a fashion stylist
and you're curating
other people's brands.
No, we have
our own private label.
So in this box
that you sent me...
This is my own private label.
Oh, I was nervous
when you did that!
?I know, so was I!
?Look, I get that.
How many are yours in here,
typically?
Well, I want to have
a higher proportion
of our private label in the box.
?How many are today?
?At least one or two pieces.
What's your margin on
the products that you
resell from others?
It's usually around the 50%,
but is hard to tell.
I really need better technology.
Like, that is why I'm here.
So you need
a financial person.
That is why I'm asking...
I don't even need finance.
I could go to a bank.
I need a partner...
You're doing this yourself?
No, you need somebody
that's gonna do your P&amp;L's,
that's gonna be,
like, helping you.
Because
if you don't know here,
like, what's the profit
that your making...
Oh, yeah, no.
I need better...
?Because, is it just you?
?Yeah.
Is it just you packing
the boxes, shipping them out?
?I hired somebody in March.
?Yeah.
And then I hired somebody
two weeks ago to also assist,
and now we're...
Just walk me through the
inventory for a second, okay?
So there's three of you
running the business.
Because, here's what I think
is happening.
I got a business
called Surprise Ride
that ships boxes to people
every month,
and it's
a subscription service.
Every month
they're different.
Every month they curate
to every single mother.
But they also pick select
products...
Hang on.
?This is not custom.
?But tell me what's different.
?I listen to what the mom's say.
?Well, hear me out.
They want to diminish the
appearance of the large breasts.
?Elena, I get all that.
?They go for those clothes.
I wanna talk about
the inventory challenge.
Do you pick and pack,
you put them in the box...
First of all, our model
is more amazing
than a traditional retail model.
?But let me ask you if...
?Well, let him ask the question.
?Actually, you have challenges.
?Let me finish.
Well, of course we have
a lot of challenges.
As more and more people
come into the platform,
now every week or every cycle
that you're sending them a box,
you have to buy the inventory,
you have to put it
on your shelf,
that ties up capital.
Then you put it in the box
that hasn't been paid for yet.
You go...
I've already negotiated
a bunch of net terms,
and I'm also crazy at driving
down the wholesale prices.
But tell me where I'm...
You've got an answer
for everything.
I'm not afraid, Mr. Wonderful.
Bring it.
Give me the tough questions.
?Wow.
I'm gonna tell you where
you're gonna hit a brick wall
in a minute, okay?
?[ Laughs ]
Because
what's gonna happen to you
is you're actually going to go
out of business.
And I'll tell you why.
This is a calculation called
"return on assets," okay?
This is a really important part
of your model.
As you grow and you keep sending
boxes to people,
you have to have inventory
on the shelf.
That's cash.
You have to buy it with cash.
What you need to do
is to quicken the cycle
from when you have to
buy the inventory
to curate the fashion
to ship it to somebody...
The moms can select if they want
to receive it sooner,
but that's actually how
I've been able to get
this to this level.
?No, but.
?I do like keeping it at the...
If you're
really successful...
I have customers lined up,
and I know when...
?You're not listening to me.
?What level are you at?
Corcoran: Can I ask you
to slow down on your answers?
It seems like
everything we ask,
before we even get the words out
you're jumping right in it.
And it's going to work
against you.
So just take a breath.
It's important to have
enthusiasm, but take a breath.
Love the enthusiasm.
What are you sales?
What are your sales
of your great store?
Last year, $83,000 in sales.
And that was actually
on the side,
because I was busy
raising my children.
We've already surpassed last
year's sales at about $84,000.
By the time I close out
this month,
we'll be at $100,000,
because I have about 100
shipments I have to process
when I get back.
And how much do you have
in inventory?
In cash?
About $160,000.
?$160,000?
?$160,000 in inventory?
When you ask
how much is in it,
are you asking the wholesale
or the retail?
?What's your costs...
?Your wholesale costs.
Your wholesale.
How much did you pay
for your inventory?
Um...
This is a big,
important number, Elena.
I understand.
It's about $120,000.
Okay, Elena, Elena,
where did you get $120,000
to support that inventory?
I started the business
with $11,000
and I have never taken a salary
on it,
so I keep turning it over.
Then I bought more clothes, and
I turned that into more profit.
But you've also put
your own money in.
But your margin's...
I did a line of credit
for $40,000.
There you go.
Okay.
?I'm not fancy.
?So, do you have that?
?I'm smart, but I'm not fancy.
?Is that on ??
is that debt now, the $40,000?
?Yeah.
$40,000 line of credit,
and then I've got $27,000
on credit cards.
You sold $100,000.
What did it cost you?
What are the cost of goods ??
to get that $100,000 to sell,
what did it cost you?
I can't tell you that.
So, how do you keep track
of everything?
How do you do your books?
?Excel and paper.
?Elena, we've all been...
?That's why I'm here!
?No, but Elena...
You guys, if I can make $100,000
using Excel and paper...
?Elena, you know...
?You didn't make $100,000.
An Excel spreadsheet's okay.
[ Laughs ]
You haven't made anything
yet.
Don't confuse
selling $100,000
with making $100,000.
Profit, is that what you mean ??
what you're saying?
Yeah,
because like Kevin said,
you keep on adding to your debt,
right, to finance all this.
That could
all be lost money,
and your falling
further and further behind.
You've sold $100,000 here.
You've got $120,000
in inventory.
Yes.
And you've got $67,000
in debt,
and it never occurred to you
to say,
"We need an accountant
or bookkeeper
to make sure I know
what's going on."
Well, I have an accountant
and he's my husband,
and he's very good.
The problem is, he's not
dedicated to this business.
He has his own job.
Well, then, that's still
the same answer, Elena.
You didn't get it done.
I'm out.
Oh, no. Okay.
Reel it back in.
'Cause I am here ??
no, I am really here for a deal.
Like, I know this business
is gonna make money.
I am the queen
of breast?feeding fashion.
You don't know, though.
There is no ?? there is no other
clothes in the United States
and the plans for this business.
?You don't know.
The mistake ?? the mistake
in your presentation...
I gotta develop
the private label.
Like I said, I'm not fancy,
so maybe I don't know
these, like, crazy numbers
that I'm supposed to know
a little faster
off the top of my head.
But that's ??
I can learn that, too.
I am not afraid.
I mean,
if I don't understand something
I go in there
and I'm like, "Look..."
Corcoran: You know what...
I actually think ??
I actually think
it's very hard for me to
see if you really have
a good business here.
It's just that
it's so very confusing
that you don't enable us
to make a decision,
"Yes, we want that thing."
?I??
So, because of the confusion,
I'm out.
?Thank you for your feedback.
?A pleasure.
I mean, I really do ??
this business, I'm expecting,
is gonna be up to $220,000
by the end of the year.
Mr. Wonderful, the fact that
you keep looking at numbers,
let me explain it to you, too ??
and Lori, also, and Robert.
If you guys want to be
dead to me, that's fine.
I want you to come back.
I will hope to try
and bring you back.
I know every single thing
there is to know
about breast?feeding clothes.
And from all around the world.
?Elena, you can stop selling.
But I don't wanna buy
from them.
Everybody understands
what you're doing.
You can't own this inventory
<i>and</i> acquire customers
And you are losing money...
?You know what?
you are gonna give up on women,
'cause the fact of the matter
is there is not gonna be
breast?feeding clothes.
It has nothing to do
with giving up on women.
It has nothing to do
with...
Like, these designers
are not selling it
at their retail level.
It has nothing to do
with the women.
I love what you're doing.
The model is broken.
It doesn't work.
I'm out.
Thank you for your feedback.
Elena, why is the
moms and the breast?feeding ??
why is this
such a passion for you?
I mean, 'cause I am a mom.
[ Laughs ]
Because I breast?fed
two kids,
and I know what it feels like
to not feel good.
Elena, I admire the cause
and people are very passionate
about it.
Nobody doubts your enthusiasm.
It's off the charts.
It's infectious,
I know, thank you.
?It's...
?I am a character.
But look, you're...
People like talking to me,
I get it.
But see, you're not even
listening to me.
No, I'm listening to you,
it's off the charts, I'm sorry.
You're not, you're not,
and that's the problem.
If you wanna have a cause,
go for it.
If you want to run a business,
at a certain point,
you can't deflect.
This is the "Shark Tank."
We love our businesses
as much as you love your cause.
And for the business that you
pitched, it doesn't add up.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Lori, give me a life line here.
[ Laughs ]
I'm like, if you're not in here
how can I ?? can I get you?
I am definitely disappointed
in myself for this moment,
'cause I feel like I've done
a not?good representation then,
if this is the feedback.
Listen, passion is great,
but it's only a fraction
of running a business.
I also think that
the subscription model here
is gonna be
really challenging.
I don't think the model's
going to work for you.
I think you need
a lot of help.
I'm out.
?Okay.
?Good luck, Elena.
Oh, I had my moment
and it sucked, but thank you.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, gosh.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?Wow.
?That was unbelievable.
I didn't wanna do the ugly cry,
but I need a tissue.
Does anybody have a tissue?
No, you guys lead me here
with no tissue? [ Chuckles ]
You know what,
she wasn't here for a deal.
She was here
for a life preserver.
Oh, my God.
She would kill me.
All right, now I need a drink.
I need like, a stiff drink.
I need a drink.
Painful to watch that.
