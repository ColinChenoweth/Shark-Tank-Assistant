Hi, I'm Lisa Binderow.
I'm the CEO and founder
of Nicepipes Apparel.
And I'm asking for $100,000
for 10% of my business ??
the hottest new thing
on the active wear market.
But first, let me give you
the origin story.
So, I'm a yoga teacher.
I'm walking home
from teaching my class,
and I'm freezing cold
in my crop pants, right?
And all I can find are these
sweater?material leg warmers.
They're itchy,
they don't stay up,
and they don't keep you
that warm.
Ugh, terrible!
So that weekend,
I designed
leg warmers and arm warmers
made from the same
amazing fabric as yoga pants.
Nicepipes are unique.
They add style, color,
and functionality
affordably
to every workout wardrobe.
So Sharks, who's ready
to show me their pipes?
[ Laughs ]
So, I have some back here,
in what looks
like an appetizer tray.
?Thank you.
?I have pink for Lori.
?Thank you.
?Oh, I like that.
?Camo for Kevin.
?Do you make them in America?
I make them in L. A.,
actually.
?What does this sell for, Lisa?
?For $42.
Corcoran and Herjavec: What
does it cost you to make them?
Thank you, Robert.
So, when I started they were
$10, but they're now $7.50.
How do you sell them?
I sell them on my website,
and we're in 40 stores.
Mostly yoga studios,
gyms, places like that.
What are your sales, Lisa?
My first season, I was selling
out of my apartment.
And when did you start, when you
say your first season was...
It was last winter,
so about 18 months ago.
I did about a little over
$80,000 in sales.
Love everything about it.
How's the business
worth $1 million today?
Yeah, 10 times lifetime sales
is a lot.
Yeah, like you seem
so reasonable and normal...
?[ Laughs ]
?... until I look at the value.
So, I think
there's major potential,
and the reason that I know that
is because I am a customer.
It's my world.
I've been in the fitness
industry for eight years.
Every time I teach a class,
everyone wants to buy it.
Here's why
it's not worth a million.
While it's
a very creative product,
it's not proprietary
whatsoever.
Anybody can knock you off.
The amount of stores your in
is tiny
compared to the amount of stores
it could be in.
It's sort of like a hobby,
in a way.
A hobby ?? how insulting.
Tell him he can take a walk.
O'Leary: No, because you ??
if you went downstairs
and got run over
by a truck...
[ Laughs ]
These are my options?
[ Laughter ]
?I'm just saying...
?This is how Kevin negotiates.
?I ?? listen.
?There's no infrastructure.
There's no ?? you're...
If someone had said
to Sara Blakely,
like, "Don't make Spanx...
Don't make
control?top pantyhose
because Hanes
is gonna beat you up..."
I absolutely agree,
and I know her.
You gotta understand, looking...
?And she listened to that,
like, she is Spanx,
I am Nicepipes.
Look at the growth
of her business.
She has thousands of employees.
?Good answer.
But she didn't
when she started.
The point is that everybody
starts with one thing.
?You're right.
?Everybody starts somewhere.
So what's your point?
Why are only valued
at a million?
Why isn't it $100 million?
Oh, my, sorry, I remember ??
she had sales!
Oh, never mind.
?[ Laughs ]
How much money did you put
into the business?
So, I've put in
just shy of $300,000.
?Whoa!
?$300,000?
?$300,000!
?Wow!
Why did you ??
how did you spend so much money?
Where did it go?
I'm sitting on $65,000 worth
of inventory right now.
So, what's
your core competency?
What is it
that you're just phenomenal at?
I think that I am
a valuable executive.
I think
that I understand people.
I think I understand
how to manage people.
I think I understand the...
?You're killing me, Lisa.
What's wrong with that,
Mark?
Because that's so generic,
right?
It's not generic at all.
You gotta have something you
fall back on where you say,
"I am so good at this,
no one can touch me."
?She's a great executive.
?Look at me.
I'm standing here, doing this.
And I feel like I'm doing great.
Listen, if you don't agree with
him, give him hell, Harry.
All men think
they're right all the time.
I think I executed
this exceptionally well
with no background in business.
?That's fine.
Do you think companies
don't need CEOs?
?You're not a CEO.
?Yeah, it's you.
You're an entrepreneur,
and that's great.
But you're not a CEO.
When you stand on that carpet
and you tell me your business
is worth $1 million,
all the niceties and all
the stuff goes out the window.
The fact that
you had to spend $300,000...
That's her choice, Mark.
What she chose to spend her
money on is her choice.
The fact
that she had to spend that much,
because you didn't know
what you were confident in.
It's not that I don't know
what I'm confident in.
It's that I have determination,
and I think that
is more valuable than saying,
"I'm really good
at designing."
Was $300,000
your entire life savings?
Listen, let's just say we're not
buying a house any time soon.
At the end of the day, this is
a business that did $80,000.
There is no scenario
on this planet
where this is worth
$1 million.
I'm out.
Okay.
Lisa, I never wanna rain
on anybody's parade.
I love the fact
you started a business.
You lose all credibility
when you stand there
and you tell me you think
this is worth $1 million.
It doesn't make me trust you.
It's so incomprehensible.
I hate hearing that you don't
trust me. That's...
Well, I just don't know
how you make a valid decision
to say
it's worth $1 million.
I just don't get there.
I can't take it seriously.
I'm out.
?Okay.
Get out there and just sell,
right?
Yeah.
'Cause you got
all that inventory.
Every waking moment that
you're not doing something else,
while you're thinking
of ideas,
be out there selling
and taking orders.
Because you should be able to
kill it with this product.
You just have to
get that focus on sales.
It's not a fit for me.
I'm out.
Listen, I don't think
that you can always know
exactly
what you're gonna be great at
when you first start
a business.
You have to figure that all out
for yourself.
I did it. I had no help.
I had no mentor.
You can do it.
I like the product.
?Yeah.
But, I see it
as a nice business for you.
I'm out.
?Thank you, Lori.
Why do you think the business
is worth $1 million?
Um...
I'm just gonna like,
be brutally honest...
Brutally honest
is always good.
... and I mean, at this point
I might as well
just lay it out there, right?
Yeah.
I didn't know
how to value a business.
?Did you come in to negotiate?
?Absolutely.
I didn't want to come in and
ask for a number that was lower,
and then have no room.
Well, I would label that
common sense,
not a bad trait
to have in business.
What I like best about you
is that not many entrepreneurs
that stand up here and when Mark
is throwing a ton at them,
when Mr. Wonderful, who we all
know is not wonderful at all,
throwing a lot of crap
at the entrepreneur,
and you just kept talking
right through their talk.
?Mm?hmm.
?You don't see that often.
?Have we seen that often?
?Mm?hmm.
?You're one tough cookie.
?Thank you.
Thank you.
?So, here's my offer.
I need to take 40%
of your business for $100,000.
in Lisa's arm and leg warmer
company, Nicepipes,
but she wants
40% of her business.
And there's one huge
contingency.
It's contingent
on Grace and Lace
agreeing to partner with me
on this deal.
Grace and Lace
is a great leggings company
that I invested on "Shark Tank"
that does $20 million a year.
?Wow, that's amazing.
?Just think about that.
Here's what they could do
for you.
They don't spend a dime,
and all of their sales
come through social media.
So you'd be getting a partner
that you really need.
But I want them in with me
before I would give you
that money.
What do you want to do?
I want to think for a second.
Don't think too long.
I think being able to work with
someone like Grace and Lace
is like a dream come true
for me.
?Very valuable.
?Um...
hmm.
Well, get focused here,
Lisa.
But I think that 100...
You say you're a great CEO.
Make your decision.
I wanna come back
with $100,000 for 25%.
Not doable.
Okay.
I appreciate that offer
so much,
but I don't think that
I'm willing to give away 40%.
Maybe I'm not doing it the right
way in the first 18 months,
but I have faith in myself
that I will figure it out.
Don't you dare
second?guess yourself.
I do have faith in myself
that I will figure it out.
Lisa, are you sure?
You have
a non?proprietary sock
and you're sitting alone
in your living room.
Come on,
it doesn't make sense.
This thing,
anybody can knock off.
Be honest with yourself.
You know what?
I'm honest with myself,
but I also believe in myself.
Lisa, you don't have to
explain it to Kevin.
You stick to your guns.
?My goodness, what a mistake.
Greiner: You know what?
Lisa, stick to your guns.
Stick to your guns
and show us all
that you made
the right move.
Lisa, the best revenge
is success, right?
Yeah.
So, you said no.
?Thank you. Good luck.
?Thank you.
Thank you guys so much.
Thank you.
?Go out and prove me wrong.
?Thank you.
