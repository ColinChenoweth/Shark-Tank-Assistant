Hi, Sharks.
My name is Rose Wang.
I'm from San Francisco,
California,
here seeking $100,000
for 7% of my company, called...
Oh, God!
...Chirps,
the first?ever cricket chip.
My God!
Hi! My name
is Laura D'Asaro,
and I'm the other founder
of Chirps.
Sharks, it's time to eat
what bugs you with Chirps.
Now, you've seen
a cricket product before,
and you know that crickets
are one of the healthiest,
most sustainable
protein sources out there.
But you also know
what the challenge is ??
How do we get people
to eat bugs?
To get people excited
about eating bugs,
we put crickets in America's
favorite snack food ?? chips.
Chirps are what we call
our gateway bug,
because chips are something
people already love to eat.
Chirps tastes like
a good corn chip,
but in one serving,
you get as much protein
as an egg white and 30% less fat
than regular potato chips.
They're non?GMO,
gluten?free, and all?natural.
And the best part ??
There's one cricket per chip.
And Chirps are just
the beginning.
If we can get people excited
about eating bugs,
we can put bugs
in all sorts of foods!
So, who wants to chip in
the future and try some Chirps?
Both: Bug Appétit!
[ Laughter ]
Okay, so we're
gonna try these.
Yeah, absolutely.
Bring them on.
There's one cricket
per chip.
Per chip.
Yeah.
Cuban:
Why just one in ??
There's not that much protein
in one cricket.
There ?? So, our chips have
4 grams of protein per serving.
Right now, we want
to have more cricket flour,
but for a lot of our consumers,
they think one cricket
is enough.
How many crickets
per bag?
So, in the small ones,
there's about 70.
One cricket per chip.
Kind of smells a little funky
when you open it.
Well, let me
ask you something.
Okay.
Looking on the ingredients,
number 1 is corn.
Right.
Then you have beans.
<i>Then</i> cricket flour.
Right.
So what is the point
of using the crickets?
What we wanted to do
is create a chip
that's one of
the highest?protein chips
on the market
and also have
other healthy ingredients
that complement
the cricket flour
to introduce it
to consumers.
You taste them,
people would buy them.
The flavor's great ??
particularly, your barbecue,
I thought, was really tasty,
nice and crisp.
I think
they're delicious.
Am I tasting the flavor
I'm picking up?
Is that from the cricket,
or is that from other flavoring?
So, the cricket has a ??
It's like kind of an umami.
It adds a depth
to the flavor.
Mm?hmm.
It's slightly nutty,
but you might be getting
some of the beans,
as well,
that are in the chips.
I see.
So, tell the story.
What got you into this?
So, Rose and I were
college roommates at Harvard,
and I studied abroad
in Tanzania
and ended up meeting this woman
selling fried caterpillars.
I bought one, and my first
thought when I bit down was,
"This tastes
like lobster."
And so I got back and started
researching eating insects
and found out they're
so sustainable, so healthy.
And I was like,
"Why aren't people eating this?"
So I sent Rose an article
about eating insects.
[ Chuckles ]
And I had just
come back from China,
where I had
a fried scorpion
and had the same reaction
she did, which ??
"Oh, this tastes
like shrimp."
We're like, "Well, let's try to
get other people to eat bugs."
Outside the United States,
this is really normal.
About 80% of countries
eat insects,
and it's often
a delicacy.
Africa ?? big.
Yeah. So, I was
an African?studies major,
and, like, when
the termites came out,
it was like,
"Celebration time!"
This isn't just about
eating bugs, right?
Yeah.
Right.
Right, there's got to be
a social component there.
There's got to be
a bigger mission.
What is it?
Yeah, for us,
insects are one of the most
sustainable protein sources
out there.
So, for example, it takes
2,000 gallons of water
to make a pound of beef
but only one gallon of water
to make a pound of crickets.
Crickets are, by far,
one of the healthiest,
most sustainable
protein sources.
What does one bag cost?
Yeah, so, our small snack size
is $1.99, and our ??
That's what
we have here?
Yes.
Yeah, those guys.
And then the big ones here
are $3.99.
And what does it cost you
for a small?
A small is 48 cents now.
We could get it down
to 40 cents.
For the whole bag?
That's not bad.
Yeah.
So, we actually just signed on
with the two largest
natural?food distributors
in the U. S.
We are in
73 airport stores,
as well as 20
natural?food stores currently.
And what ??
what will you sell this year?
So, this year, we're gonna end
the year about $200,000.
Okay, and next year,
what do you think you can do?
We think we can do
$1.5 million.
Whoa!
That's a big jump.
Why would that be?
Based on what?
One of our biggest clients that
are coming to us are museums,
zoos, aquariums,
theme parks.
We're in the biggest theme park
in the Southeast,
and so from even
just one of these parks,
we can turn about
100 bags per SKU per week.
So that's
a much bigger velocity
than you would get
at a natural?food store.
The snack business is a
multi?billion?dollar franchise.
Yes.
You know, Miss Happy over there,
you're smiling so much.
[ Laughter ]
When you get into
a large retailer that says,
"You want 2 linear feet
in my snack department?"
They're gonna say,
"Give me a million bucks,"
and you won't be
smiling so much,
because you're gonna
have to buy your share.
I really am concerned, and I ??
You know, I say this on deals
where you're trying
to steal share
from a very old,
established market.
They are gonna crush you
like the cockroaches you are.
Yes.
We knew you were gonna
call us a cockroach.
We were waiting for that.
[ Laughs ]
We are so excited
this happened.
How are you gonna
get a share?
I think the first thing
to point out
is that we're not a
"Me, too" product on shelves.
There's no other
cricket chip out there,
and that's
great marketing.
That's something that will draw
customers into stores.
We get a lot of free press.
Do you raise any money?
Yeah, so, we have
bootstrapped this
by winning
pitch competitions.
We've won over $200,000
at pitch competitions...
Good for you.
Wow.
... to build this.
But in terms of equity, no.
We own all of the company.
Greiner:
What's your next move?
What do you really see
you doing with bugs?
Yeah, so, we see Chirps as
what we call our gateway bug.
But really,
what we want to see
is a whey protein replacement
on the market,
and so cricket flour
could really be
that whey protein
replacement,
like shakes or juices
and things like that.
So, like, a protein mix ??
a protein shake mix.
Right, exactly.
Yeah.
So, this is obviously an area
that's interesting to me.
Yeah.
And I agree
with your mission.
I agree with your vision.
Yeah.
Right?
Obviously,
I have Chapul.
Yeah.
But I also have Nuts n More.
I have Alyssa's Healthy Cookies.
All that are in this category.
All are high?protein.
Yes.
Yeah.
Very high protein.
All look for
various protein sources.
Right.
Right.
So sustainable protein
is something
that I'm very interested in.
Right.
So I'll save you some time
in all this.
I want to make you
an offer.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll give you the $100,000,
but I need 20%,
because you're gonna be working
with the companies I mentioned,
but it's got to be
worthwhile to me.
Greiner:
I'll tell you something ??
I think he's a fantastic partner
and a great deal for you.
I'm out.
Okay. Thanks, Lori.
I was waiting
for a "but."
Cuban: Guys, I wasn't
setting this up.
I was gonna get
really excited.
Yeah, I wasn't setting this up
to just, "Okay, I'll wait here."
If you want
to counter, counter.
If you don't want
to do the deal,
say, "I just don't want
to do the deal."
Okay.
Would you do
$100,000 for 15%?
Done.
Whoo!
Whoa!
Whoo!
[ Laughter ]
Greiner: The Cricket King
and Queens.
Cuban: Thank you.
Oh, my God!
[ Laughs ]
Great job, guys.
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Guys, the product
is really good.
Congratulations.
Let's get America
eating bugs!
Whoo!
[ Both laugh ]
Whoo!
Oh, my God!
[ Both laughing ]
Wow!
Oh, my gosh!
It feels amazing.
Like, when we first started,
everyone told us we were crazy.
"This is never
gonna work.
Nobody's gonna
believe in this."
And to have Mark Cuban, who is
a well?seasoned entrepreneur,
who really gets this,
to believe in us,
I mean,
it's a dream come true.
