My name's Jackson Mann,
from Minneapolis, Minnesota,
All right,
thanks, Jackson.
Yep.
Here you are, Lori.
Greiner: Thank you.
Here you go,
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you.
High?fidelity earplug.
Thank you.
So, Vibes are reusable,
washable,
Mann: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, there was
a huge difference.
Is it 50% reduction?
No, so, it's gonna reduce
22 decibels on average
across frequencies.
What decibel level
does this play at?
I'd say
95 to 105 decibels.
So, to give you
a point of reference,
95 in an arena is loud.
So, anything above 85 decibels
is damaging to your hearing.
So at 100 to 115 decibels,
you're damaging your ears
within 15 minutes.
How loud is
the average dance club?
Around 100 decibels.
That's a good question.
So you're doing damage,
for sure.
The average concert
is 100 to 110 decibels.
O'Leary: So...
So absolutely,
you're doing damage.
I was curious
to see these guys,
who are amazing,
aren't wearing these things.
Ta?da!
Greiner: Ohh!
Corcoran: Ohh!
They are! Look.
That speaks to
how damn invisible they are.
Mann: Yes, yes.
Amazing.
Actually, McNasty, thank you
very much for your time.
Mann: That is the acoustic
filter which we use,
Jackson, you know,
my son writes music ??
electronic dance music.
He's an engineer, as well.
Mann: Yep.
Because I'm a very hip guy.

Fundamentally,
those are meant to be seen,
Corcoran: Jackson,
where are you selling them now,
Jackson,
I fear you can't sell.
Congratulations,
Jackson.
Greiner: Good luck.
Good luck
with your company.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Take care.
Thank you.
I know that Kevin often goes
to royalty deals.
I already knew going in there
that that wasn't something
I was willing to take.
The business is too small,
