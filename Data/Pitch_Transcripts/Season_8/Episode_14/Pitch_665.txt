My name's Jackson Mann,
from Minneapolis, Minnesota,
and my business is Vibes.
I'm here seeking $100,000
in exchange
for 20% of my company.
I want to change the way
people listen to live music.
I love going to concerts,
but that comes with a price.
I ended up rupturing my eardrum
at a concert due to loud sound.
Wanting to not do that again,
I did what most people do and
grabbed a pair of foam earplugs.
I put them in
and instantly realized
they are not designed for music.
They are designed
for snoring spouses,
mowing lawns,
construction sites ??
things like this ??
but not music.
This is what inspired me
to create Vibes ??
high?fidelity earplugs
designed for music.
They lower the decibel levels
of your environment,
while retaining
the sound quality,
so you hear the music
exactly as it's coming
through the speakers ??
just at a lower decibel level.
Our goal is to make
a better concert experience,
save the world's hearing,
make earplugs cool,
and make a lot of money.
So, who wants to join me
on this journey with Vibes?
Can we get samples?
I would love
to hand them out to you.
All right,
thanks, Jackson.
Yep.
Here you are, Lori.
Greiner: Thank you.
Here you go,
Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you.
High?fidelity earplug.
Thank you.
So, Vibes are reusable,
washable,
and virtually invisible.
Each pair comes with
three interchangeable tip sizes
and a hard?size pocket
carrying case for easy storage.
They're
extremely comfortable.
But what's the difference
between this
and putting in
a rubber?ish earplug?
So, a foam earplug
is <i>blocking</i> the sound,
and this is actually ??
Vibes is actually <i>filtering</i> it.
It's lowering the decibels
equally from bass to treble.
Can I ?? Can I run you
through a demo?
Mm?hmm.
I'd love to.
Feel free to put them back in
like a pair of headphones.
Turn it to 11.
I don't know if these speakers
are gonna do it,
and I think we're gonna need
to take it up a notch.
So I would love to introduce,
from Minneapolis,
the McNasty Brass Band.
[ Up?tempo music plays ]
[ Laughs ]
Wow.
[ Music stops ]
Greiner: Wow.
Wow.
[ Applause ]
Tight. Really tight.
So, who wants
to rock 'n' roll?
Cuban:
Yeah, big difference.
You can really hear it
so clearly ?? Wait.
You can really hear it
so clearly.
Greiner:
You know what?
Mann: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, there was
a huge difference.
Is it 50% reduction?
No, so, it's gonna reduce
22 decibels on average
across frequencies.
What decibel level
does this play at?
I'd say
95 to 105 decibels.
So, to give you
a point of reference,
95 in an arena is loud.
So, anything above 85 decibels
is damaging to your hearing.
So at 100 to 115 decibels,
you're damaging your ears
within 15 minutes.
How loud is
the average dance club?
Around 100 decibels.
That's a good question.
So you're doing damage,
for sure.
The average concert
is 100 to 110 decibels.
O'Leary: So...
So absolutely,
you're doing damage.
I was curious
to see these guys,
who are amazing,
aren't wearing these things.
Ta?da!
Greiner: Ohh!
Corcoran: Ohh!
They are! Look.
That speaks to
how damn invisible they are.
Mann: Yes, yes.
Amazing.
Actually, McNasty, thank you
very much for your time.
Sacca: You guys are great.
And I got it from here.
[ Corcoran chuckles ]
[ Up?tempo music plays ]
Okay, let's get into
the numbers.
My line of cost is $4.
Okay.
They retail
for $23.99.
Seems like a lot to me.
Yeah.
Yeah, it does
seem like a lot.
Sacca: So, all right,
I'm pulling this thing apart.
I take off the earpiece, and
I've got this conical interface.
There's some metal in there.
What is that?
Mann: That is the acoustic
filter which we use,
and that helps balance
the sound frequencies.
Is that something
you created?
No, that is often used
in hearing aids, actually,
to help speech intelligibility
and ?? and sound to travel.
Jackson, you know,
my son writes music ??
electronic dance music.
He's an engineer, as well.
And I have
some massive Cletron speakers.
He likes to <i>crank</i> them...
Oh.
... to crazy levels.
And so over time,
he's gone online
and bought everybody
in the family your competitor,
which we have by the dozens
lying all over the house.
They're not $23.
They're significantly cheaper.
They do exactly the same thing.
Correct.
I carry a pair of these
everywhere I go.
Mann: Yep.
Because I'm a very hip guy.
[ Chuckles ]
Fundamentally,
those are meant to be seen,
and I don't think
the market's ready for that.
There's too much stigma.
Oh, so that's the difference?
You're not gonna see this,
and these are?
Interesting point.
That could change my mind.
There'd be
certain situations
where I don't want
to be seen wearing earplugs.
People aren't ready to ??
to be seen wearing these,
and making them
a fashion statement is ??
What stops these guys
from just doing the same thing?
We are patent?pending
in the U. S.
Sacca: For what?
For utility and design.
Yeah, but for what?
It has to do with the actual
dimensions that are in it,
how the sound moves
within it,
and then where certain filters
are placed.
Corcoran: Jackson,
where are you selling them now,
and what are your sales?
We're selling them online
through our own website,
as well as on?site
at certain events
and through some wholesale
and retail.
We've been selling
for the last five months,
and our sales are $30,000.
Ooh.
Greiner: Do you think
that your sales are low
because there are
so many competitors,
or you just haven't been able
to get it out there enough yet?
I don't think we've been able to
get it out there as we need to.
We just got going
with a national distributor.
They've started to sell
to music stores.
We're in about 20
right now.
So it's ??
Sacca: The biggest challenge
in this market is the fact
that they're never with you
when you need them.
The point of purchase
is so far away
in both space and time
from the point at which
you need to use them.
We've all been at the concert
that's too damn loud,
and you're like,
"God, I got to find a tissue
or something
to stuff in my ears."
[ Chuckles ]
Sure.
The big challenge here
is, what are you gonna do
to get these things
closest to the people who need
them at the time they need them?
That has been the disconnect
that I see, and, really,
the music entities themselves
need to come on board to this.
They don't care.
They don't care.
And as I mentioned ??
No, we do care.
I think they do care.
Look, I own an arena,
and we book music.
Yep.
And, you know, when
the Mavs play, it can get loud.
And you see coaches
that have earplugs.
And these would be great.
But they have to be giveaways.
And at $4 cost, you can't afford
to price them as giveaways.
And I don't think you can
make it a big enough market
to make it worthwhile.
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Sacca: I'm gonna jump in, too.
I mean,
as my grandmother taught me,
never be bashful
about ending the meeting early.
I don't want to waste your time
or my time.
This is interesting enough.
I might be a user of them,
but, like I said,
the biggest holy grail here
is I need them
at the moment I need them,
and they're never at the moment
I can purchase them.
I don't know
how you fix that problem.
And so I'm sorry ?? I'm pulling
the plug on this one. I'm out.
Jackson,
I fear you can't sell.
And if you can't sell
this product into whatever store
that you wanted to go into,
who's gonna do the selling?
You need to be a salesman,
and for that reason, I'm out.
You know,
it's a quality product.
But this is something
that I think people look at
for the time
in which they need it.
But it's not something
that they need <i>all</i> the time.
So I think
it's a very hard sell.
I'm out.
Here's my take
of the situation.
I'm the only guy here that
actually has a pair of these ??
not yours, obviously ??
in my pocket.
I like your product for the
very fact that you can't see it.
Here's the problem
with your deal.
There's not that much
proprietary element
to your product.
I think Chris tore it apart
and looked at it.
Anyways, I'm only gonna
make you one offer,
and I'm not gonna negotiate.
Here's the deal ??
This is a classic royalty deal.
I'll give you the $100,000
with a royalty of $2
for every pair sold
until I get my money back.
And I want 35% of the company
to be an ongoing partner.
So I'm not asking for anything
more than my money back
in a way
that I have a true path.
Then I'll join you
in a partnership.
I'll promote this thing,
using your product every day.
And I <i>would</i> use it every day.
It's my only offer.
Not interested in negotiating.
Take it or leave it.
Congratulations,
Jackson.
Greiner: Good luck.
Good luck
with your company.
O'Leary: Thank you.
Take care.
Thank you.
I know that Kevin often goes
to royalty deals.
I already knew going in there
that that wasn't something
I was willing to take.
The business is too small,
and we can't be pulling money
out of it at this time.
