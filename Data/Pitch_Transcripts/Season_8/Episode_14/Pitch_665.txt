Hi.
I'm Amelia Cosgrove.
And I'm Bryan Thomas.
And we're the co?founders
of Pop Up Play,
from Austin, Texas.
We're seeking $250,000
in exchange
for 6% of our company.
Cosgrove:
They can play make?believe
or color in
this life?size coloring book
they designed themselves.
Now, parents ??
and, obviously, kids ??
They love Pop Up Play.
But the opportunity
is much bigger than that.
We've had significant
inbound interest
from some of the world's
largest brands,
who want our help
solving their problem
of engaging with kids
and their families.
In fact, we already
have a partnership
with one of the world's
largest automakers,
and we have a pipeline
with over 75 companies.
So come on, Sharks,
and join the fun.
It's time to imagine,
create...
Both: ... and play!
Thanks for coming,
guys.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you!
Greiner: Bye, guys.
Corcoran: Bye, guys.
Cosgrove: All right.
Thomas:
That's right.
Okay.
This was obvious to us
that it was a much more
lucrative opportunity
in terms of dealing with brands.
Remember, we had an ??
But a much longer
sales process,
much more expensive to convert
sales process.
Okay, so, I have two deals
in the same space ??
Paper Box Pilots
and Surprise Ride.
Mm?hmm.
It's always the same story ??
customer acquisition costs.
Yeah, so, we're not
in the toy business, Kevin.
And I just want to make sure
we're on the same page here.
We're an on?demand design
and manufacturing company.
Got it.
We are working with brands
as a go?to?market strategy.
And so we originally worked
with consumers directly.
You don't care
about acquiring consumers.
That's correct.
Not anymore, yeah.
You basically want
to go find more.
That's a different
sales process.
Absolutely.
Cosgrove:
Yes, absolutely.
That's why they changed.
That's why they pivoted.
Yeah, but I'm not sure
it's more lucrative,
because
it's a long sales cycle.
That's what I said, Kevin.
Where have you been?
[ Chuckles ]
To ?? To me, it's ??
I go right back to looking at it
saying, "I've got, I don't know,
a quarter of a million customers
that have already bought
in that age bracket."
Uh?huh.
But it's not clear to me
that you know
what the customer acquisition
cost is
before I give you
that database.
So I'm not your Shark.
I'm out.
Okay, Kevin.
Thank you for your time.
Cosgrove:
Thanks. Thanks.
There's got to be
a lot of people
making this type of product.
I feel like
I've seen it before.
Cosgrove: Right, well,
there are products <i>like</i> this.
Right.
Not the experience.
And what's the range
of what they sell for?
So, they sell
from about $35 to $90.
I think
the price is too high.
And you haven't
proven anything.
You have <i>one</i> client that's been
the bulk of your sales.
I don't really believe
it's a business yet.
Okay.
So, with all due respect,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you
for your time.
So, how much money
did you raise?
So, we've raised
$325,000
from Techstars,
Capital Factory,
Silverton Partners,
and Floodgate.
Okay.
And what valuation
did you do then?
And what was the valuation
of that round?
That was
a $3 million valuation.
I think that
it's a very clever idea.
On the flip side,
for me right now,
as an investment,
it's a little too early.
I'm not sure
what direction we'd be going.
Thomas: Okay.
Cosgrove: Okay.
And so I'm out.
Well, thank you
for your time, Lori.
Thanks.
You didn't design
this software
with the vision
of building kids castles.
The initial concept was toys,
but we knew really early on
that it could apply
to things far beyond toys.
What else can you make
with this software here?
This can be used
to cut any sheet material.
So we're talking sheet metal.
We're talking wood, fabric.
Can you guys integrate to ??
into Minecraft as a mod at all?
[ Chuckles ]
I know.
We would love to,
easily.
Wouldn't that be great?
Cosgrove: Yeah.
Sacca: So, just to be clear,
you think in the future,
a kid could export
their Minecraft design
through your software all the
way through to be manufactured?
But the problem is getting
Microsoft to go along.
So, technically speaking, Chris,
we could do that right now,
today, if the partnership
was in place.
Okay, well, I don't agree
with the one?off brand sales,
because that makes you
more of a sales organization,
Congrats, guys.
Thomas: This is fun.
Thank you.
Good job.
Thomas: Chris has
a ton of credibility.
I mean,
he picks winners.
And for him to put his name
on Pop Up Play is ??
is a significant honor,
and we're really excited
about it.
