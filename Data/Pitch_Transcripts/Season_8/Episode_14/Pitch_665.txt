Hi.
I'm Amelia Cosgrove.
Cosgrove:
They can play make?believe
or color in
this life?size coloring book
they designed themselves.
Cosgrove: All right.
Thomas:
That's right.
Okay.
This was obvious to us
that it was a much more
Absolutely.
Cosgrove:
Yes, absolutely.
That's why they changed.
That's why they pivoted.
Yeah, but I'm not sure
it's more lucrative,
because
it's a long sales cycle.
That's what I said, Kevin.
Where have you been?
[ Chuckles ]
To ?? To me, it's ??
I go right back to looking at it
saying, "I've got, I don't know,
a quarter of a million customers
that have already bought
in that age bracket."
Uh?huh.
But it's not clear to me
that you know
what the customer acquisition
cost is
before I give you
that database.
So I'm not your Shark.
I'm out.
Okay, Kevin.
Thank you for your time.
Cosgrove:
Thanks. Thanks.
There's got to be
a lot of people
making this type of product.
I feel like
I've seen it before.
Cosgrove: Right, well,
there are products <i>like</i> this.
Right.
Not the experience.
Thomas: Okay.
Cosgrove: Okay.
Wouldn't that be great?
Cosgrove: Yeah.
Sacca: So, just to be clear,
you think in the future,
a kid could export
their Minecraft design
through your software all the
way through to be manufactured?
But the problem is getting
Microsoft to go along.
So, technically speaking, Chris,
we could do that right now,
today, if the partnership
was in place.
Congrats, guys.
Thomas: This is fun.
Thank you.
Good job.
Thomas: Chris has
a ton of credibility.
I mean,
he picks winners.
