Which part of this
is your core competency?
Yeah, so, we are ?? we are
a software company, Chris.
So we see ourselves
as a platform to enable
custom, on?demand design
and manufacturing of products.
By the way, did you say
what your relationship was?
We didn't.
We're married.
Oh. Do you have children?
Congrats.
We don't have kids yet.
Pop Up Play is our baby.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah, that's good.
I know how that goes.
Walk us through
an average order.
Let's get to some numbers.
Sure.
Forget about the ??
the big high end
and the low end.
Just the middle of the road.
Each order, no matter what
a child designs,
is a flat $99 price point.
Okay.
And then we charge
a flat $10 shipping
for the delivery
of each item.
How many have you sold
to date?
In about
the last 11 months,
we've done about $330,000
in revenue.
Sacca: Wow.
Corcoran: Wow.
And that's ?? that is
composed of two components.
We just booked a deal
with one of the world's
largest automakers
that's valued
at $300,000.
Ohh!
So, wait. That's all
of your revenue, practically.
You're saying you're $330,000
in ?? in the ?? in the year.
And you're anticipating $300,000
comes from them?
Yes.
So you've only sold $30,000
outside of them?
That's right. Yeah.
That's not good news.
That's not good news at all.
and it goes away
from your core competency.
It doesn't add up
to an investment for me.
I'm out.
Sure. So I'm ??
O'Leary: Still one Shark left.
No point
in talking to him anymore.
I'm John Staff.
And I'm Pete Davis.
And we're here in the beautiful
Catskills in Upstate New York.
And we are the creators
of Getaway.
John and I met at college,
where we had both moved
from a small town
to the big city
with all the hustle
and bustle.
As society
gets more technological,
people are desperate
for an escape hatch,
and it turns out
that escape hatch
is all around us ??
the great outdoors.
[ Birds chirping ]
With Getaway, you go
to a beautiful tiny house
in the woods, where you can
just disconnect and recharge.
A tiny house is exactly
what it sounds like.
It's a regular house
with windows and doors
and a cooktop and a bathroom
and a shower, but shrunken.
You sit
by the campfire.
You roast marshmallows.
You read a good book.
You just do nothing.
Hello. This is John
with Getaway.
We're going on "Shark Tank"
because we want to level up
from a cool idea
to a national phenomenon.
But we also think it's important
to impact people's lives
by providing them a way
to recharge and find balance.
And we want to provide that
to as many people as we can.
Hi, Sharks.
My name is John Staff.
And I'm Pete Davis.
We're from Boston,
Massachusetts,
and our company
is Getaway.
We're asking for $500,000
for 5% of our company,
which is providing
hardworking Americans
a new way to disconnect
and recharge.
You need a getaway.
You need to find a way
to carve out time to unplug.
That's where we come in.
Getaway has handcrafted
the perfect way to escape.
Here's how it works.
You're having a super?stressful
day at work,
and you think,
"I need to get away."
"I need a getaway."
[ Laughs ]
You go to our website,
you pick out your favorite
tiny house design, and boom.
Boom.
You're texted a key code
and a map
to your own Getaway house
in the woods.
You hop in your car. You pick up
your friends or family.
You hightail it
out of the city.
And in an hour or two,
your own personal,
beautiful tiny house,
surrounded by serene woods,
is waiting for you.
With your cellphone
locked away
and marshmallows roasting
in the fire pit
waiting to become s'mores,
work, for that moment,
becomes a distant memory.
Okay, Sharks,
with your help,
we can make the instant cabin
available nationwide.
Let's talk about the model,
because that, I assume,
is rolled into place,
it's the land you lease.
Correct.
Close to Boston.
Let's take the Boston market.
So, we put
these things up
to two hours
outside of the city.
It's designed
to be an affordable,
quick getaway
from the city,
where you just
totally disconnect.
We design
these tiny houses.
We put them
on beautiful rural land,
and then
folks come out to them.
So they pay $99 per night,
and they're completely set up
and ready to go because the idea
is that it has to be simple.
Will I find Kevin
at the next house
on the other side
of the treeline?
[ Chuckles ]
We design the spot
so that it feels like
it's your own private
tiny house in the woods.
Because people
say, like,
"I just don't want
to see any humans.
I'm sick of my house."
So no one else is around.
Although, on the flip side,
that could be, like,
out of a horror movie.
[ Screeches ]
[ Laughs ] Good point.
What about security?
So, you're all alone.
You're out in the woods.
Very remote.
Feels like a great setup
for, like, a "Blair Witch."
Yeah, it does.
So, we have a site manager
that's very close by,
and they don't know
the site manager's there,
but if something
goes wrong,
there's someone right there
very fast.
It's much safer
than camping.
Right, so the economics
have got to be great, right,
'cause your cost of land
is next to nothing.
It costs you how much
to build a house?
$30,000 to build a house.
It's a quarter ??
One?quarter
of what a hotel costs.
So the houses pay themselves
back in 18 months, currently,
and that's coming down.
We get the same daily rate
as a hotel night
and double the margin.
The issue is
utilization rate, right,
because you're not gonna
rent these every day,
and depending on where they are
in the country,
you have snow issues,
other issues, right?
Yeah, let me ??
Mark, great news.
We're at close to 100% occupancy
with all of our cabins.
How many cabins do you have?
10 cabins.
Well, that's why. Right?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do
with the money?
We want to bring Getaway
national.
We want to really be the
instant cabin nationwide brand,
and we're only in New York
and Boston now,
but if you give us the money,
we can expand to the West Coast.
Have you guys
already raised money?
Yeah, we've raised $1.2 million
in seed capital.
Oh!
What valuation?
Sacca: At what valuation?
Most recently,
at a $7 million valuation.
Whoa.
Let me talk about
how we got to
the valuation we're at.
So, number one, we've
raised money previously.
Number two, we're actively
fundraising right now.
All of those meetings
we're having
with VCs
across the country
are about a $12? to $15 million
pre?money valuation,
and nobody's
blinking an eye.
We're coming here
with a $10 million valuation
because we know you guys
are worth the discount,
because of all the value
you're gonna bring.
We're so flattered.
Thank you so much,
being worth the discount.
We mean it.
Especially you, Barbara.
Oh, how lovely.
Walk us through
your revenue assumptions.
What are you gonna make
this calendar year?
What is free cash flow?
We're gonna do
almost $300,000 this year.
We get a 60% margin
on that.
Next year, we're gonna do
$2.1 million.
Where do you expect
to be in five years?
Five years,
we're gonna be in 30 cities
with 30 units
in the U. S.
That's 1,000 units.
Okay, so 1,000 units
at $30,000 a unit.
So that's $30 million
right there.
Yeah.
What is it gonna cost you
to manage a city?
Because over time, particularly
because of the elements,
you're gonna have to depreciate
those assets.
So, we depreciate these things
over 10 years with ??
Too long. Too long.
I think after seven years
in a New England winter,
that thing's gonna look like
a piece of crap.
Sacca: If not sooner.
So I think
the problem with this deal
you're gonna find out with other
Sharks ?? I may be wrong ??
is that there's gonna be
a big fight about valuation
because nobody wants to put it
in at a $10 million valuation.
So they're gonna ask
for a lot more equity.
I'm going the other way.
Here's the deal.
I'll give you a <i>loan</i>
of $500,000
for three years at 11%.
And for all the trouble I'm
gonna go through to set that up,
I want 2.5% of the equity
of the company right now.
Here's what
really concerns me.
You have 10 tiny cabins ??
You're out here
peddling for $10 million.
So I don't understand
how you got there,
but I sure know
the bottom line makes no sense,
and for that reason,
I'm out.
Thank you, Barbara.
Thank you.
Cuban: Look, guys,
the problem is scale.
In order for you
to get to be a big company,
it's gonna be tough, right?
You're gonna be raising money
from now until evermore,
because you have to keep on
building houses
and you have to keep on
rebuilding any houses
if the elements take their toll
more than you expect.
You're gonna be raising money
for a long time.
You're gonna get diluted
further,
and I'm gonna have to keep on
investing more and more money
just to keep my equity.
Heavy capital investment,
not enough upside.
I'm out.
Pete and John have an offer
on the table from Kevin
for their tiny cabin
rental business, Getaway.
But they also want to see
if Chris is interested.
Guys, I'm gonna give you
10 seconds to take my offer
or not, 'cause I'm actually
getting bored.
You can decide yes or no.
In 10 seconds, I'm out,
and then you can hope
you can cut a deal with him.
Chris,
do you have an offer?
Uh, I?I would ??
Five...
I would come back in at the same
terms as your other investors ??
at 500k at the same terms
of your prior investors.
I'm out.
That offer's gone.
I'm out.
500k at
a $7 million valuation.
Yeah, I would ?? Well, actually,
let's talk now,
because the clock just expired
with O'Leary,
and now it's just you and me
and your tiny houses.
Chris, you realize
that this is ??
This cannot be
a one?time investment.
This is
a capital?intensive business
that's gonna require
a lot more,
and this negotiation over equity
has to take place every time
because
they're gonna be diluted.
I get it.
But ultimately, when something's
worth $1 billion,
if I only own 3% of it,
we still make a ton of money.
Sounds like
a "yes" is on its way.
What are you gonna do,
Chris?
Staff:
Appreciate it.
Greiner: Good luck.
Corcoran: They seemed like
they were going to do it,
though, for a while there.
No, there's no way
they could do it.
You're getting anti?dilution,
basically,
and no one else has it.
Sacca: You know
what happens sometimes?
You come in here
and you're negotiating
with a professional negotiator,
and before you know it,
you've just dug yourself into
a hole you can't get out of.
Staff:
We got to be loyal to the people
who brought us here,
and making that deal with Chris
would have been disloyal.
Look, when we're
a $1 billion company
and they're stressed out
that they're missing on
the returns they could have had,
we're gonna let them stay
in a Getaway.
We're the bigger men.
[ Laughs ]
