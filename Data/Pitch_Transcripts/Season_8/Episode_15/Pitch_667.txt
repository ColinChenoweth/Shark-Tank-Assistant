My name is Stan Efferding.
My company is The Kooler.
And I'm asking for $50,000 in
exchange for 15% of my company.
I'm an IFBB
professional body builder
and world?record power lifter
known throughout the industry
as the White Rhino.
[ Scattered laughter ]
And I'm the reigning
title holder
of the Mr. Olympia's World's
Strongest Pro Bodybuilder.
Cuban: Dang.
I've been training
amateur
and professional athletes
for over 25 years,
and I tell my athletes,
if you want to press
a 200?pound dumbbell overhead...
[ Grunting ]
?Oh, ho!
?Oh, my God!
[ Laughter ]
Herjavec: Wow!
Yeah!
?Oh!
?Oh, Lord!
?[ Laughs ]
?Hup!
[ Grunts ]
[ Laughs ]
...then you'd better get
proper nutrition
before your workout,
and if you want
to dead?lift 600 pounds...
What?
Hup!
[ Grunts ]
Ahh.
[ Bang ]
?Holy crap.
?Oh, my God.
...then you'd better
stay hydrated.
And if you want to flip
an 800?pound tire...
[ Grunting ]
Hup! Ay! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up!
?Bam!
?Blow it up!
[ Laughter ]
...then you'd better get
plenty of protein
to recover from your workout.
That's why I invented
The Kooler.
It's the world's only
cooler within a cooler.
First, it's a double?wall
insulated cooler
that holds a gallon of ice water
that you can drink
while exercising
or throughout the day.
If you want a protein shake
or an energy drink
while you're training,
here you go.
Ice cold.
If you want a snack or
a meal?replacement drink after,
The Kooler comes
with a second shaker bottle.
I designed it to hold some
protein or carbohydrate powder
for your
post?exercise nutrition.
Now, remember,
the ice water goes in here,
and when the shakers go in,
the water keeps them cold.
The Kooler keeps
three drinks all together
inside one ice?cold container.
So, what do you say, Sharks?
You won't find a "cooler"
business for your investment.
Together, we can <i>crush</i>
the competition.
[ Laughter ]
I have some samples.
Robert, for you and Lori.
?Hey.
?Thank you.
?Yeah.
?Wow, these aren't even heavy.
?Thank you, Stan.
?Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you.
I can really see this applying
to heavy?duty lifting people
'cause they always have
the protein shakes,
they always have
the water.
It's a lot
of containers.
But do you see it
as a wide product?
I think the average guy
would use it,
because I ?? I notice
the average guys in
the gyms all the time
with their gym bags are loaded
with multiple different drinks.
You know, first of all,
the average <i>girl</i>
should be included here.
That's a good point.
But when you think
universally about a product,
you want to have it
be convenient
for a broad, mass audience
because that's how you're
gonna get better sales.
Not necessarily.
O'Leary:
Listen, White Rhino...
Wait. I don't ?? Wait.
...I sense a little skepticism
amongst the Sharks.
Excuse me.
But you could
blow that away
by telling us
you've sold a lot of them.
Well, I've been 16 months
on the market.
I've sold $120,000 worth
of product.
How did you sell them?
?That's not bad.
?That's not bad at all.
I have a national distributor,
the largest one in the country.
It has seven
regional warehouses,
and they supply
over 30,000 locations.
What kind of locations?
General Nutrition Center,
Vitamin Shoppe,
mom?and?pop nutrition stores.
Have you been selling any
online?
I am.
Half of my sales are online.
What do you
sell it for?
I pay $7.
I sell it for $32.95.
So you've made some
decent money off of this.
It pays for itself.
I break even thus far on
an aggressive travel schedule.
I've traveled all over
the country to expos ??
So you're going
to all the different shows?
Yes.
When I go to the expos,
I expect bodybuilders
and power lifters
to come up
and buy my product.
But I find that
over half of the consumers
are moms and dads, children,
police officers, and firemen
who are on the road.
O'Leary: You're telling me
a soccer mom will buy this?
Absolutely.
There's 30 million kids
a year
that sign up
for kids' sports.
Cuban: Stan, what's been
your biggest challenge?
Why haven't you sold
a million dollars worth
as opposed to $120,000?
My biggest challenge is
when it sits on the shelf
at a store,
you can't tell what it is
or what it does.
Right.
I have
to touch every customer,
and what I want to do now
is I want to try and utilize
either an infomercial
or a QVC?style presentation
to talk to those soccer moms,
to show them
the benefits of the product
so I can reach
thousands of people at once.
What's your background?
Do you have any other
businesses you've run?
I do.
It might be easy to judge
this book by its cover.
Ha!
But I've turned
three startup companies
into multimillion?dollar
businesses.
And I started
an engineering firm.
Last year, we did $5 million
in gross sales.
Now, I became a silent partner
in that firm
a year and a half ago
so I could focus full?time
on The Kooler.
You know, White Rhino,
you're an impressive guy.
When you first
walked out here,
I thought,
"Okay, meathead guy."
But you've got
a really good background.
Love the passion,
and I like what you've done.
And you're ?? you're
the brand kind of thing.
But it's extremely vertical
and niche?y.
I don't think
I'm gonna make any money.
I like you, White Rhino ??
I really do ?? but I'm out.
Thank you,
Mr. Wonderful.
Cuban: Here's what
I see, Stan.
It's a good idea.
You know how to sell it.
But what's missing
is an accelerant.
I don't see what
that accelerant is.
It's gonna take your
hand?to?hand combat to sell it.
That's a problem for me,
and so for those reasons,
I'm out.
Okay. Thank you.
When I invest
in a product,
I like something that I can
sell to all my customers.
This is very, very niche.
You spoke about, it's great
for an infomercial.
The thing a lot of people
don't understand is,
is that infomercials
are extremely difficult.
9 out of 10 fail.
This, on QVC,
because of your audience,
which I think is much more
sports?oriented,
and that I don't see as a heavy
QVC?watching audience.
I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Herjavec:
I see the opposite.
I think you're trying
to make a niche product
and appeal
to too wide a base.
I wish
it was <i>more</i> hard?core.
I'm out.
Thank you.
Daymond,
that leaves you and me,
and I need help carrying
this tire out of here,
so we got to make a deal.
[ Laughs ]
I know it definitely
doesn't <i>look</i> like it,
but I have a lot to do
with fitness.
?Where?
?Really?
Yeah.
I just sold my CrossFit.
I work with bodybuild??
'Cause you don't look
like White Rhino.
?Huh?
?You're the reverse.
You're the inverse.
[ Laughs ] Yeah.
[ Greiner laughs ]
Are you saying
Daymond's the "before"?
?[ Laughs ] Yeah.
?I think so.
Yeah.
Um...
All right, I'm gonna make you
an offer, but...
[ Exhales ] So...
But here it comes.
$50,000 for 15%...
Are you sure you want
to make the White Rhino mad?
O'Leary:
Could get ugly here.
Yeah.
Okay, so,
I'll give you $50,000
for a third
of the company.
I think
that's a fair offer.
But before I make
a final decision,
I do have to ask
the big guns.
Guys, what do you think?
[ Laughter ]
Daymond, you got a deal.
All right.
All right.
[ Applause ]
Congrats, White Rhino.
Thank you.
Just don't squeeze me, man.
?Making him happy.
?Okay.
All right.
I think I made a great deal.
Daymond understands
the industry.
He understood the product.
He knows the players.
So it was an easy match.
What we know now is
the White Rhino has
a new partner ??
the Black Rhino.
[ Laughter ]
And let me tell you
something else.
We're never gonna have
a disagreement.
[ Laughter ]
It's water?resistant.
Aww.
It's easy to clean.
So, right there
in Marissa's living room,
I had my "aha" moment ??
to make foam beautiful.
Watch as we transform
this eyesore
into a gorgeous,
peaceful playspace.
including under
their standing desk,
as soft flooring
in their kitchen,
or even as an exercise mat.
So, Sharks, which one of you
want to help me
drive the circus out of town
and bring some serenity
into the homes
of stylish parents everywhere?
All right.
And also, the top comes off,
so you can stand on it,
shower off, and go right into
your flip?flops at the beach.
Yeah, we tried
to think of everything.
So, this is just
the ultimate portable shower
when you're going outside ??
camping, fishing, hunting.
understanding plumbing and
electrical and engineering
and all that stuff.
I understand
the equity is a lot.
Mm?hmm.
What if I went to $350,000
for the 20%?
It's more
the equity that it is...
Uh?oh.
...than the amount of,
you know, cash coming in.
?Cash, yeah.
?Yeah.
