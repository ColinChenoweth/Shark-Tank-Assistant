My name is Stan Efferding.
My company is The Kooler.
?Thank you, Stan.
?Mr. Wonderful.
Thank you.
I can really see this applying
to heavy?duty lifting people
'cause they always have
the protein shakes,
they always have
the water.
It's a lot
of containers.
But do you see it
as a wide product?
I think the average guy
would use it,
because I ?? I notice
the average guys in
the gyms all the time
with their gym bags are loaded
with multiple different drinks.
You know, first of all,
the average <i>girl</i>
should be included here.
That's a good point.
But when you think
universally about a product,
you want to have it
be convenient
for a broad, mass audience
because that's how you're
gonna get better sales.
Not necessarily.
O'Leary:
Listen, White Rhino...
Wait. I don't ?? Wait.
...I sense a little skepticism
amongst the Sharks.
Excuse me.
But you could
blow that away
by telling us
you've sold a lot of them.
Well, I've been 16 months
on the market.
I've sold $120,000 worth
of product.
How did you sell them?
?That's not bad.
?That's not bad at all.
I have a national distributor,
the largest one in the country.
It has seven
regional warehouses,
Cuban: Stan, what's been
your biggest challenge?
Why haven't you sold
a million dollars worth
as opposed to $120,000?
My biggest challenge is
when it sits on the shelf
at a store,
you can't tell what it is
or what it does.
Right.
I have
to touch every customer,
Cuban: Here's what
I see, Stan.
It's a good idea.
You know how to sell it.
But what's missing
is an accelerant.
I don't see what
that accelerant is.
It's water?resistant.
Aww.
It's easy to clean.
So, right there
in Marissa's living room,
I had my "aha" moment ??
to make foam beautiful.
Watch as we transform
this eyesore
into a gorgeous,
peaceful playspace.
