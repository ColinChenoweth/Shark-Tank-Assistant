I'm Elizabeth Granados,
Granados: When my
super?stylish BFF, Marissa,
invited me over
to check out her new home,
I knew I'd be impressed.
She's one of the most
stylish mamas I know,
which is why I was
literally horrified
to see these tacky,
circus?colored foam play mats
all over the floor
in her living room.
Now, to be fair to Marissa...
?[ Shrieking ]
?Shh.
...her decision to use
foam flooring was,
in fact,
quite practical.
[ Laughs ]
It protects her little ones
Uncle Wonderful, would you mind
babysitting Talia for a moment?
?[ Laughs ]
?Kids love me.
Greiner: She's gonna
start crying.
John: Why do you think
she's crying?
[ Laughter ]
Don't be scared.
?Aww. Hi.
?Hi.
[ Laughter ]
Yay!
She knows cash flow
when she sees it.
[ Laughter ]
Introducing Little Nomad ??
beautifully illustrated,
printed play mats.
It looks
like an heirloom rug
So, Talia ??
I think she needs a nap,
Granados:
I do have some swatches
so that you can
feel the quality close up.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
I got to tell you,
Elizabeth,
how many families other than
the Upper East Side of New York
want to spend 150 bucks ??
So far, 1,000 moms
throughout the U. S.,
So, Elizabeth,
you've done such a great job
to get to this point,
but you didn't talk anything
about doubling down
on what's working for you
online.
I will continue
to sell online.
You said,
"I'm gonna take that money,
I'm gonna go retail."
This giant piece
of inventory
is not gonna find its way
to a retailer.
It takes up
too much space.
Why go retail at all?
Well, that's what
I want to know because ??
They're ridiculous.
They always say that.
Elizabeth, have you heard
the story of Ulysses,
very famous
Greek mythology?
[ Chuckles ]
He was
a very great captain,
But there's a progression,
Elizabeth.
There's
a progression.
Here's what I see.
You're a very driven
entrepreneur, which is good.
But the trade?off
of that ??
There are just
some entrepreneurs
that are better
as solo entrepreneurs.
Right now, it's your baby.
You have your vision.
I don't think you're
ready for a partner
at this point in time.
I'm out.
I'm very sorry
to hear that.
Elizabeth, this is a mat
made of foam, okay?
An <i>expensive</i> mat
made out of foam.
I just think
you're gonna have
a very hard time
making money with this.
I'm out.
You know, Elizabeth,
you're very, very, very early.
There's way more you don't know
than you know today,
Good luck,
Elizabeth.
I didn't make a deal.
I didn't think
it would come down to this.
I have worked myself to the bone
to get to this stage.
I really thought
it would have worked out,
so it's just kind of surprising.
