Hi, Sharks.
My name is Chris Crawford.
And I'm Eric Fagan.
And we're two surfers
from San Diego, California,
here today to offer you
5% for $250,000
for a bite out of our company,
RinseKit.
What if I told you
that we have a product
that everyone could use
but nobody knows it exists yet?
The RinseKit is the ultimate
portable shower system,
and it revolutionizes the way
you go outside and have fun.
Basically, every RinseKit
comes with a little adapter
that we give you
to attach to your hose bib.
This nozzle right here
is on a quick neck,
so all you got to do
is attach it, plug it in,
turn on your hose bib
outside your house,
and the water pressure
transfers into the RinseKit,
compresses the air,
and now you have 65 PSI
trapped inside the RinseKit.
This whole process
takes about two minutes.
It's two gallons of water.
So, once you disconnect
the RinseKit,
you hook up your nozzle,
and you get
the same water pressure
that you get out
of your garden hose.
[ Water spraying ]
And it'll spray
on this center setting
for a little over
five minutes.
And on the mist setting,
it can go
for 30 to 45 minutes.
So, Chris, what's
the number?one reason
people are gonna
buy this?
Well, the reason I invented it
was for surfing.
I would get in my car,
I'd be all salty, sandy.
My seatbelt would get
all gunked up.
It wouldn't reel up.
And then we found out
there was all sorts
of other uses for it
beyond that.
I mean, if you're gonna
go camping, you know,
to be able to rinse off
your dishes on the spot,
rinsing off the kids...
You know,
with the mist setting,
you know, half?an?hour
of cooling the kids off
at the soccer game
is huge.
And what ?? what's
your background?
I used to own
my own pool business.
You know, it helped me
with hydraulics,
And what about you, Eric?
What do you do?
So, I actually help
with the sales
and the operations
of the business.
My background is running
Global and Sales and Operations
for companies.
Are you an investor
or are you an agent?
We have equity in it.
Who's "we"?
Me and my partners.
So, Chris,
break it up for us.
You started it.
How much money did you put in?
Who owns what?
So, I sold
my entire pool company
and put it all into this.
How much?
I sold it for $75,000,
and I used that to kind of
fund me so I'd have a living,
and then I talked
to one of my clients.
He was like, "This is cool,
I'm gonna help you,"
so he got 10%
to come on board,
and he gave me $75,000.
From there, we're like,
"Okay, this is starting
to get some traction."
How many years ago
was this?
It was
about three years ago.
Any debt?
$550,000.
?Oh!
?Oh!
?Whoa. Okay.
?Yippee?yi?yo?ki?yay!
Herjavec:
So, walk us through it.
Chris,
how much do you own?
I have about 60%
right now.
And...?
Well, I'm a partner
in a company,
and our company owns
10% of the business.
Eric,
what are the sales today?
Just under $800,000.
Wow.
And what do you sell it for?
What's your margin?
$89.99 retail.
Okay.
Wholesale's $45.
Our margins are high 40s.
What are you gonna make
in this calendar year?
We're gonna sell $2.1 million
to $2.3 million.
We're gonna make
about 5% EBITDA,
so it'll be around $100,000
in net profit.
?So, why so low in EBITDA?
?Yeah.
I mean, with those
kinds of margins,
you guys should
be making more.
Vesting heavy in the marketing,
you know?
We really wanted to put
our flag in the ground
and say "Here we are."
And how are you
marketing it,
and how much are you
spending on marketing?
We're spending about 10%
of our gross revenue
on marketing.
?Your company owns 10%.
?Yep.
So, are you making, also,
a sales commission off of this?
We are.
What's your
commission on it?
It varies depending
on the discount the
account receives ??
anywhere
from 5% to 8% to 10%.
Cuban: So,
the big question is ??
Where can you get
your EBITDA to ??
or, actually,
your net margins to?
So, the target
for next year,
we'd be in the high
single digits for EBITDA,
and then the year after that,
in the mid?teens.
?So, give me an example.
?So, what changes?
So you're marketing is a
percentage of sales?
That's a $4 million year,
right?
5?ish.
What do you think you'll make
on the $5 million model?
$5 million, we're gonna make
about $400,000 and change.
You're gonna make
$400,000 pre?tax,
$300,000 after tax?
Ish.
You're basically asking me
to value it
at 18 times
sales two years from now.
I mean,
I'm just getting back
to a question
that you got to answer.
Sure.
You're very expensive.
Cuban: Guys, I think
it's a brilliant product.
It obviously
fills a need,
but there are
certain outlets
that really are
your core customers.
Yeah.
They don't really match with,
historically, my businesses,
and it's certainly not tech,
so I'm gonna say I'm out.
?Okay.
?Thank you.
?Thanks, Mark. Yeah.
?Mm?hmm.
I'm really struggling
with the valuation,
I got to tell you.
I'm gonna have to wait years
to get my money back.
?Mm?hmm.
?It depends
on who wants
to buy the company.
But that's my only exit.
I give you $250,000 for 5%.
You're gonna have to grow
this thing geometrically
before the distributions
ever pay me back.
Let's be realistic here.
Yeah.
I think it's reasonable that
this gets to $10 million, okay?
You've already proven it,
and you've got retailers
that want to do it.
You're gonna make $800,000
on that, pre?tax,
so after tax, $600K.
And I own 5%.
I make $30,000
three years from now
on my $250,000 investment,
assuming
<i>everything</i> goes right.
Well, what if the business
is sold for $20 million,
and you have 5% equity?
?Is that ?? that doesn't even ??
?How do see what you're selling?
Because it is, right now,
one product.
How do see
you're selling this
for a large amount of money
down the road?
So, that's
a great question.
So, we're building
a category at retail,
going
into specialty retail
and creating a category
they never had before
that allows them
to make money.
We can create an ecosystem
around that.
We can add
other products.
We've done a lot of stuff
with the lid ??
you know,
holding trays ??
and there are ways
to wash your dishes on it.
We've got heaters,
we've got field?fill kits,
wheels, shower poles.
Can I say something,
though, too?
Like, when we built the forecast
models for this business,
we didn't include
any big?box.
I mean, could you not
see this product
sitting in Target
on an end cap
for a mom to walk by
and like,
"Oh, my gosh,
I can rinse my kids off
after I go
to the beach."
?Well, Chris, I like it.
?[ Chuckles ]
I mean, I think
it's a great idea.
Thank you.
As a fellow surfer,
I see the need.
I love the need with the kids.
Lots of lots of markets.
The only part
I didn't like, Eric,
was it's always dangerous
when you build a company
that has to have an exit.
And that is the fundamental
problem with the deal.
At 5%, if it sells,
I'm good to go.
?Right.
?Mm?hmm.
If it doesn't,
you get sales agency commission,
I get nothing.
Make us an offer.
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you
the $250,000,
but I don't get an agency fee
along the way, so I want 20%.
?Oof.
?Mm. That's hard.
That's twice
what my whole company owns.
[ Laughs ]
It's a lot.
You know, I don't think
his offer's unreasonable.
I was gonna say
your business is worth about
2 million bucks right now,
and if there's no exit,
I don't want to wait eight years
to get my money back.
It's too much risk.
I'd do the $250,000 debt.
You're already used
to putting debt on.
You've got $500K.
And I want 5% equity
for taking the risk.
I don't think it's a good time
for you do that.
Cuban: I agree.
I agree with you.
That's 20%.
That's very dilutive.
20% is a lot.
I mean, that dilutes Chris
significantly.
What are you guys gonna do?
You've got two offers.
[ Chuckles ]
I mean...
I'm gonna make you an offer.
I'd like ??
You're gonna make an offer?
?There you go.
?Yeah.
What's your offer,
Lori?
Well!
I'm gonna make you an offer
that's kind of like you.
I want to be like Eric.
$250,000 as debt for 5%,
but I want the same royalties
that you get on what I bring.
You're asking for more
than Kevin did, basically.
?Of course she is.
?Yeah, she is.
She's expensive,
but, you know, she brings it.
I bring that value.
She only gets paid
for what she kills.
I know your history. I know what
you're capable of doing.
?Chris, Eric.
?Yeah.
I'm not a loan?shark kind
of guy.
Yeah.
I'm an equity guy.
Yeah.
There's a lot of noise here,
and there's two debt deals.
[ Chuckles ]
I like my equity deal.
To be honest,
I don't want to see Chris
dilute below
a majority.
I mean, this is his brainchild,
this is his baby.
He built his life
around it.
His wife's a schoolteacher.
They have a 2?month?old.
You're gonna have to do
a debt deal if you want that.
You can create a structure
where he has the voting.
All right, guys, look.
You've got offers on the table.
You've got
to make a decision.
Chris and Eric have
three offers on the table
for their portable shower,
RinseKit.
O'Leary: Okay, so you've got
three offers.
$350,000 from Robert
for 20% straight equity.
Lori, $250,000 for 5% equity,
but it's debt,
and she wants to be paid
the same sales commission
for the territories
and products she brings in
that you
mutually agree on.
I'm willing to do the deal,
$250,000 straight debt.
I want 5% equity,
as well.
Three offers.
What are you gonna do?
So, honestly,
selling debt
isn't something we really
want to do right now.
I mean, we have access
to capital.
You know, a lot of people
can go find any VC,
but it's totally different
when you have a Shark.
Agreed.
I totally agree.
A completely different story.
So, it's not
apples to apples.
Right.
Yeah, but you're offering debt.
You're not offering equity.
Well, but if you want
to keep control,
you have to take debt.
Well, but we also know ??
You can't
give 20% away.
But if you look
at our balance sheet,
we already have enough debt.
What's that?
Guys, you have
to make a decision.
Hold on.
I have an offer.
$250,000
for 7.5% straight equity.
But I also want commissions
on the retailers that
I sell this product into.
Now, I have relationships
with several of them.
I'm on the board
with PECO Foundation.
I'll also sell to Home Depot,
Tractor Supply Company, HSN,
Walmart, Target, and all the
other ones that we want to go.
Is that debt,
or is that equity?
Aw. He's copying my deal,
my original deal.
No, but he's for equity.
He did it for equity, not debt.
?Ooh.
?I'm straight equity, 7.5%.
He stole your structure,
but made it
more attractive for them.
It's a great offer.
It's a pretty good
offer.
?Great offer.
?It's a very good offer.
What do you want to do?
You have to make a decision.
I mean...
Anything else you guys
want to say last?minute?
[ Laughs ]
Anybody else?
Any other counters?
Mark,
you want back in?
Nope.
Daymond...
that's a great offer.
We accept it.
?All right.
?All right.
?Yeah!
?Yeah.
?Congratulations, guys.
?Congratulations, guys.
Love it!
Thank you, man.
Love it, love it.
Thanks, Daymond.
Appreciate it.
You got it.
Awesome.
