I'm Elizabeth Granados,
and I live in West Hartford,
Connecticut,
with my husband, Jeremiah,
and my daughter, Talia.
I'm here seeking $80,000
for 15% of my company,
Little Nomad.
Granados: When my
super?stylish BFF, Marissa,
invited me over
to check out her new home,
I knew I'd be impressed.
She's one of the most
stylish mamas I know,
which is why I was
literally horrified
to see these tacky,
circus?colored foam play mats
all over the floor
in her living room.
Now, to be fair to Marissa...
?[ Shrieking ]
?Shh.
...her decision to use
foam flooring was,
in fact,
quite practical.
[ Laughs ]
It protects her little ones
from bumps and bruises.
Uncle Wonderful, would you mind
babysitting Talia for a moment?
?[ Laughs ]
?Kids love me.
Greiner: She's gonna
start crying.
John: Why do you think
she's crying?
[ Laughter ]
Don't be scared.
?Aww. Hi.
?Hi.
[ Laughter ]
Yay!
She knows cash flow
when she sees it.
[ Laughter ]
Introducing Little Nomad ??
beautifully illustrated,
printed play mats.
It looks
like an heirloom rug
you might spend
thousands of dollars on.
But, nope, it's a practical,
wipe?clean, foam play mat.
They're great for crawling.
They're also great
for tummy time,
learning to sit up,
and easy to clean.
We also have some customers
who have said
the mats are great for other
uses throughout their home,
So, Talia ??
I think she needs a nap,
so we're gonna say bye,
and I'm gonna hand out samples.
Too bad she has to leave
so early.
Greiner: Bye.
I was gonna teach her
all about money.
[ Laughs ]
Granados:
I do have some swatches
so that you can
feel the quality close up.
?Thank you.
?Thank you.
Yeah,
and take one of each color.
Thank you.
I currently have one pattern
in the two colors.
Yeah, thank you, guys.
What is the plan for getting
distribution for this?
So ??
Well, let's hear about
the sales first.
Greiner: Yeah,
let's hear your sales.
Okay, so, I've been in business
for 3 1/2 months.
I've pre?sold $114,000 worth
of play mats.
?Wow.
?Nice.
Good for you. But you haven't
shipped anything yet.
My product will ship
in November.
It's currently
being manufactured.
And what did you do
to market?
We Photoshopped together a
picture ?? the designer and I ??
and I started sharing that
on Facebook mom groups,
directed them
to a landing page
where I got
their e?mail address.
Good for you.
I collected 4,555 e?mails.
?Wow.
?Moms are going nuts.
Where would you want to be
with this product?
I would love to align with
the right retail stores ??
Buy Buy Baby,
Nordstrom, Giggle.
Do you sell it
as a package?
Yes.
I sell them as a set of six.
They're 2 feet by 2 feet,
plus 12 edges.
?Got it.
?So it's a seamless connection.
And how much are you ?? how much
are you making this for?
Yeah,
what's your margin?
It's $16.39 to manufacture,
and once they're here,
my plan is to sell them
for $139.
You're definitely
at the high end
for this product.
Yeah, there's a range
from about $35 to $149.
We're not
the highest price.
Cuban: There's nothing
wrong with that.
You don't have to be
the cheapest.
Yeah.
With that kind of margin,
why not just continue
to sell them all online?
Yeah, that's
incredible margin.
Well, here's why ??
As someone who just had a baby,
I know that the registry is key.
All right.
When you came in here,
you had your competitor
on the floor.
Yep.
And your basic premise
for building this business
was the competitor's product
is garish and ugly
if you don't like
bright colors.
Yes.
But it's also half the price
of yours, right?
I figure I should know
why I'm paying twice as much.
Wait. Stop, stop.
The foam is the best?quality
foam I could buy.
And is your foam safer
than other foams?
Yes.
We've had our mats tested,
and they're safety rated
for zero months?plus.
They are non?toxic.
But that's not why
you're buying it, right?
You're buying it
for the look.
If it's true you're
buying it for the look,
why doesn't the guy
that makes the cheap foam...
Just make
a bland version?
I got to tell you,
Elizabeth,
how many families other than
the Upper East Side of New York
want to spend 150 bucks ??
So far, 1,000 moms
throughout the U. S.,
and I've been at this
for such a short amount of time.
People love it.
You don't want to make
hundreds of dollars.
You want to make
<i>millions</i> of dollars.
I do.
So why don't you
bring the price down?
So you have to appeal
to a bigger market.
That's ?? That's a big number
for somebody with a child,
who has to buy diapers
and everything else.
Then, even when I had
a play mat, it was ??
My mother found an old
refrigerator box, cut it open.
I played on it
for 10 years,
and then when I was 18,
I went outside
and broke?danced on it.
So, yes, it's $139,
but it's not something you want
to immediately get rid of.
I ?? I just ??
I don't think 95% of the county
can afford that.
Stay with me, Daymond.
Please.
I'm out.
So, Elizabeth,
you've done such a great job
to get to this point,
but you didn't talk anything
about doubling down
on what's working for you
online.
I will continue
to sell online.
You said,
"I'm gonna take that money,
I'm gonna go retail."
This giant piece
of inventory
is not gonna find its way
to a retailer.
It takes up
too much space.
Why go retail at all?
Well, that's what
I want to know because ??
They're ridiculous.
They always say that.
And that's where
you have no problem going.
Elizabeth, have you heard
the story of Ulysses,
very famous
Greek mythology?
[ Chuckles ]
He was
a very great captain,
and the biggest risk
he and his sailors
always worried about
were the Sirens that
would sing from the rocks,
and they were
so sweet in music
that he asked his men to tie him
to the mast and blindfold him
so he wouldn't guide
his ship into the rocks.
It was retailers on the rocks,
calling him in...
[ Laughter ]
...trying to get Ulysses
to come in for retail deals.
Look, Kevin ??
And he knew.
I know that Buy Buy Baby,
Nordstrom ??
these are where
the stylish moms are registered,
and that's my ??
that's my strategy,
just to get it
onto the baby registries.
At the end of the day ??
But there's a progression,
Elizabeth.
There's
a progression.
Here's what I see.
You're a very driven
entrepreneur, which is good.
But the trade?off
of that ??
There are just
some entrepreneurs
that are better
as solo entrepreneurs.
Right now, it's your baby.
You have your vision.
I don't think you're
ready for a partner
at this point in time.
I'm out.
I'm very sorry
to hear that.
Elizabeth, this is a mat
made of foam, okay?
An <i>expensive</i> mat
made out of foam.
I just think
you're gonna have
a very hard time
making money with this.
I'm out.
You know, Elizabeth,
you're very, very, very early.
There's way more you don't know
than you know today,
and you haven't shipped
a single one,
so we don't really know what
the consumer's gonna think.
It's not for me.
I'm out.
But it's not over yet.
Lori, you have been
through this.
You've created
so many products.
I really respect you
professionally
and look up to you,
so you would be
the ideal Shark partner,
and I came here to make a deal
with you, Lori.
See, I think what you've done
is beautiful.
Thank you.
I mean,
the sad thing is,
is that you can't
really protect it.
But you are first,
and it's very, very pretty.
On the flip?side, I'm not sure
how many people buy these,
and your price point's
high.
Lori, I believe that
we can do this together.
You're Ulysses,
she's the Siren.
[ Laughter ]
Are you gonna go
into the rocks?
It's really hard,
because I do ??
Lori.
I love you, and I think
it's a really smart product.
I just have to go
with my gut on
"Do I feel that this is
the right investment for me?"
And it is!
And I'm sad to say,
on this one,
I'm gonna be out.
Congrats on
your business, though.
Good luck,
Elizabeth.
I didn't make a deal.
I didn't think
it would come down to this.
I have worked myself to the bone
to get to this stage.
I really thought
it would have worked out,
so it's just kind of surprising.
