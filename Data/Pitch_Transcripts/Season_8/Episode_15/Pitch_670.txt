My name is Richard Elden,
I have tons of orders,
which is a great thing,
but I never seem to have
enough money to keep up.
If I can't fill these orders,
my competitors will,
Richard Elden here from
Manhattan Beach, California,
Richard, tell us, what's
your blended gross margin
Richard, why was
your profit only 10%
if your gross margin
is 50%?
Yeah.
So, we do trade shows.
I have payroll.
I have to pay for my warehouse.
Richard,
let me ask you this.
Yes.
Today,
you get the $350,000.
Yes.
What happens tomorrow?
That's what
he's been saying!
He needs more money
'cause he's growing!
5% ?? Look, Richard,
5% is not being a partner.
?Right.
?Okay.
So let's open it up.
Let's go bigger.
Guys, I have an order here
not part of my valuation
for almost $3 million
from QVC.
Greiner: From who?
QVC.
Richard, can we
see the order?
It's hard to believe,
I get it.
It's doing very, very well.
How many times
have you been on QVC?
We have several shows
a month.
I've been working with QVC
personally
for probably 16 to 17 years.
I've owned my company
for 15 years.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
So you've been
in business
almost 15 years
with Dbest, right?
Yes, yes.
What all of a sudden changed
to go from, you know, nothing
to $2.7 million
last year?
I started the company...
with the Quik Cart, okay?
This sold
on the TV shopping networks
for 8 1/2 years.
2010,
I developed the Smart Cart.
So you decide
you need a new product,
you come up with
a product that works.
Well, the reason
I came out with it
is because, in California,
they had legislation
banning plastic bags,
Herjavec: Richard,
let me clear things up.
Yes.
You ever watch
those old commercials
where they have a bouncing ball
over the words?
Yes.
That's what
you remind me of.
?Is that good or bad?
?I can't follow it.
Richard, my friend,
I can't follow
the bouncing balls.
Okay.
16 years in business,
this product, that product.
Okay. I've been in business
a long time.
I'm out.
Okay, okay.
Cheers.
You know what, Richard?
You know you're in my world.
Right, right.
So...I will give you
an offer.
$350,000, 15%.
Lori, no ??
Let me just summarize the deals
you've gotten, all right?
Look, I know my value.
I know different it will be
for you for QVC.
Lori, you're
underselling yourself.
Mark,
let her do what she wants,
unless you're gonna
bring a deal.
Richard has three offers
on the table
for his specialty cart business,
Smart Cart.
Greiner: You know what, Richard,
I will give you an offer.
$350,000, 15%.
Lori, no ??
Let me just summarize the deals
you've gotten, all right?
Look, I know my value.
I know how different it will be
for you for QVC.
Lori, you're
underselling yourself.
Mark,
let her do what she wants,
unless you're gonna
bring a deal.
Wait,
let me hear Mark.
Okay, if we did
a deal together, right,
he needs capital.
Yeah.
The big question
isn't the $350,000.
The big question is
what comes next,
Richard,
it's simpler than that.
Yeah, so it values your company
at $1.5 million.
Elden: Um...
[ Sighs ]
I would either like more money
for the higher equity or...
Make a counter.
Make a counter.
Don't make it
more confusing.
Okay.
Let me help you
with that counter.
Yes, please.
I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
How about
$700,000 for 10%,
Herjavec: Richard,
the longer you stand there ??
You already lost one offer.
You could lose both.
$700,000 ??
To who?
To my dream team over here.
They said no, Richard.
They said no.
O'Leary:
You really got to decide.
Neither of these deals
are gonna change.
What are you
going to do?
[ Sighs, claps ]
Let me say thank you very much
for your offer.
?Thank you.
?It was very creative.
It's a once?in?a?lifetime
opportunity,
