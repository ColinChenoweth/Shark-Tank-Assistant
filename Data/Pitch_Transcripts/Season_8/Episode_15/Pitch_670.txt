My name is Richard Elden,
and I live in Manhattan Beach,
California.
I was born and raised in London,
and I lived there
up until my parents' divorce
when I was 9 years old.
My mother decided
to move us to California
to seek a better life.
This is the land of opportunity.
If you have the passion
and you don't take no
for an answer,
this is the country to be in.
My big break came
when California decided
to pass legislation
to ban plastic bags.
How's it going today?
Good. How are you?
Big retail started
to take notice,
and my company has become
a real success.
I have tons of orders,
which is a great thing,
but I never seem to have
enough money to keep up.
If I can't fill these orders,
my competitors will,
and I can't let that happen.
I need money.
I need lots of money.
I need it now.
I am dedicating to making this
a huge success.
I know I can do it
if I get an investment
from the Sharks.
Richard Elden here from
Manhattan Beach, California,
and I'm asking for $350,000
for 5% equity in my company,
Dbest Products!
Oh, man.
We are your one?stop shop
for <i>all</i> your cart needs.
Now, let me show you
why everybody calls me
"The Cart Guy."
Smart Cart.
It weights less than 3 pounds.
It holds 110 pounds.
It folds to only 2 inches.
Wow.
It's got a convenient
front pocket.
It envelopes,
because it's waterproof.
It's got an ergonomic curvature
in the handle
because it allows you pull
more weight with less effort,
and it's got
a convenient strap handle
to go up and down the stairs,
in and out of the car,
or in and out of the overhead
compartment on the plane.
Now, we have a ton
of different Smart Carts.
We even have
a pet Smart Cart.
[ Both chuckle ]
It's luggage?style
maneuverability
in a pet carrier.
I've also developed
the Trolley Dolly.
This guy has seven different
pockets and compartments.
The back slides off,
and it turns into a dolly.
It holds 150 pounds!
[ Laughs ]
Carts are not just
for groceries anymore, guys.
That's our
cooler Smart Cart.
So, you use them
for coolers today,
use them for storage.
They even have seats today,
so you take them out
for picnics.
We even have a stair climber.
Look at that.
That's cool. Wow.
That goes up and down
the stairs,
in and out of the car.
Now, I need money,
but I don't just want
any money.
[ Laughter ]
I don't just want any money.
I want smart money.
I want a smart partner
that can help me
get into more retail
and more markets.
So, who's gonna
be a smart Shark
and join me
with my Smart Cart?
Okay.
$350,000 for 5%.
Very good.
That's right.
Should I beat you up now,
or should we wait?
?Uh, no, beat me up now.
?Okay.
Before you cart him out,
tell us what you're selling.
I mean...
Sales.
Sales this year
are already $5 million.
?Whoa!
?Oh, wow.
?Yes, yes.
?Okay.
We're projected to do between
$7 million and $8 million
by the end of the year.
We did only $2.5 million
last year...
Where are you
selling all this?
... so you can see
the growth.
Retail or online
or both?
Both.
We sell into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
Staples, Hobby Lobby...
You also have
$8 million ??
You're gonna project
$8 million in sales.
So, what are you
here for?
Well, uh ??
?He needs money!
?Yeah, I need money!
?Why do you need money?
?Why do you need money?
Okay, so,
from $2.5 million
to $7 million, $8 million,
I have to fund
the inventory myself.
Why?
Because it's my company,
I'm 100% owner,
but I'm not
desperate enough
to pay those ridiculous
interest rates.
What are they
charging you ?? 18%?
?Uh, it's more because ??
?Why not pay the interest?
Is your margin
not high enough?
Richard, tell us, what's
your blended gross margin
and what's your profit?
Blended gross margin is 50%.
Now, what is your profit,
pre?tax?
So, last year, for example,
we did $2.5 million.
Profit was $250,000.
But here's the thing ??
Herjavec: No, but hang on.
Richard, why was
your profit only 10%
if your gross margin
is 50%?
Yeah.
So, we do trade shows.
I have payroll.
I have to pay for my warehouse.
Richard,
let me ask you this.
Yes.
Today,
you get the $350,000.
Yes.
What happens tomorrow?
That's what
he's been saying!
He needs more money
'cause he's growing!
That's right.
And he wants <i>you</i>
to finance it!
Okay, but ?? but,
if you finance it,
you're gonna make the interest,
you're gonna be my partner.
I've got investments
such as ??
5% ?? Look, Richard,
5% is not being a partner.
?Right.
?Okay.
So let's open it up.
Let's go bigger.
Guys, I have an order here
not part of my valuation
for almost $3 million
from QVC.
Greiner: From who?
QVC.
And it's not part
of my valuation.
Because I was gonna say,
you know, I'm watching this,
and I've seen so many products
<i>like</i> this.
Those are probably
my products.
Richard, can we
see the order?
It's hard to believe,
I get it.
It's doing very, very well.
How many times
have you been on QVC?
We have several shows
a month.
I've been working with QVC
personally
for probably 16 to 17 years.
I've owned my company
for 15 years.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
So you've been
in business
almost 15 years
with Dbest, right?
Yes, yes.
What all of a sudden changed
to go from, you know, nothing
to $2.7 million
last year?
I started the company...
with the Quik Cart, okay?
This sold
on the TV shopping networks
for 8 1/2 years.
2010,
I developed the Smart Cart.
So you decide
you need a new product,
you come up with
a product that works.
Well, the reason
I came out with it
is because, in California,
they had legislation
banning plastic bags,
and I knew at that point
I wanted to develop a cart
that weighed less, held more,
folded thinner.
John:
Is this your biggest?selling
product that you've had
through your course
of being an entrepreneur?
Smart Cart?
Yes. Yes.
Because the way we're looking
at you is that, you know,
you're here for basically
somebody to help finance
not only this,
but ongoing orders
and grow the business
off of that.
Right
I'm gonna make you
an offer.
I'll give you
the $350,000 for 15%,
and then I'll take you
into Samsung in my deal.
That means
warehousing, shipping,
distribution, returns ??
everything else like that.
So, when get $1 billion
in orders, we can ship it.
So you'll provide
all the financing?
Sam??
O'Leary: So, let me ?? let me
chime in here.
I'll do $350,000
in a line of credit.
You draw it down
as you want it.
It's 18%.
And I'm gonna take
5% equity.
So, I'm your partner ??
I'm an equity partner.
But you haven't
solved his problem.
So ?? What's that?
You haven't solved
his problem.
Right.
Look, you're telling me
this cash won't help you?
You can draw it all down
and keep it out there.
Yeah, but he'll
draw it down like that
because just his QVC orders
are gonna eat that up.
Greiner: Who sells
your product?
Well, then, Mark,
you give him a deal.
I'm just bringing up
the facts.
Herjavec: Richard,
let me clear things up.
Yes.
You ever watch
those old commercials
where they have a bouncing ball
over the words?
Yes.
That's what
you remind me of.
?Is that good or bad?
?I can't follow it.
Richard, my friend,
I can't follow
the bouncing balls.
Okay.
16 years in business,
this product, that product.
Okay. I've been in business
a long time.
I'm out.
Okay, okay.
Cheers.
You know what, Richard?
You know you're in my world.
Right, right.
So...I will give you
an offer.
$350,000, 15%.
Lori, no ??
Let me just summarize the deals
you've gotten, all right?
Look, I know my value.
I know different it will be
for you for QVC.
Lori, you're
underselling yourself.
Mark,
let her do what she wants,
unless you're gonna
bring a deal.
Richard has three offers
on the table
for his specialty cart business,
Smart Cart.
Greiner: You know what, Richard,
I will give you an offer.
$350,000, 15%.
Lori, no ??
Let me just summarize the deals
you've gotten, all right?
Look, I know my value.
I know how different it will be
for you for QVC.
Lori, you're
underselling yourself.
Mark,
let her do what she wants,
unless you're gonna
bring a deal.
Wait,
let me hear Mark.
Okay, if we did
a deal together, right,
he needs capital.
Yeah.
The big question
isn't the $350,000.
The big question is
what comes next,
and at what
interest rate?
You know
this business.
I don't know
this business at all.
I have no problem doing
a $1 million line of credit,
$2 million.
So if you think
it's legit,
$350,000 for 20%
and a minimum of $2 million
in financing
at 15% simple interest.
I'll do that deal.
You get what you haven't had
and what you really need,
which is an immediate access
to liquid capital.
So $350,000 for 20%?
Equity, yeah.
But the difference is ??
?That values my company at ??
?What's he saying ??
No, but you're looking
at that wrong.
O'Leary: No, he isn't.
He can look at it
any way he wants.
Wait, wait.
Hold on, guys.
So, you're saying
that you have ??
you have orders
you can't fulfill...
Uh?huh.
...stores you
can't go into.
Uh?huh.
So even though
you take a smaller ??
you have 80% now
instead of 95% ??
Richard,
it's simpler than that.
Yeah, so it values your company
at $1.5 million.
$1.5 million, and I'm valued
at $7 million to $8 million.
Yeah, but listen.
Let me ??
Yeah. You're worth
at least $4 million,
so you're giving them
too much equity.
Let me just
tell you again.
How much sales
do you have
that you can't
fulfill right now?
Sales you can't take now because
you don't have the cash?
So, as of this moment,
it's about $1 million.
So now you give up
that extra 20%.
The question is, does the value
of your company increase
by more than 25%
because now you can
take that capital?
Not at $1 million
in sales.
That doesn't work,
my friend.
That's what
you have to decide.
Well, but listen.
Then you're with me,
so then your orders
will double,
triple, quadruple.
I like the structure.
I don't like ??
So you're gonna be selling
so much more.
You're gonna need
so much more money.
I would like it
if you could consider
a lower equity position,
so that we can come to ??
What equity
would you want?
Elden: Um...
[ Sighs ]
I would either like more money
for the higher equity or...
Make a counter.
Make a counter.
Don't make it
more confusing.
Okay.
Let me help you
with that counter.
Yes, please.
I'm out.
[ Sighs ]
How about
$700,000 for 10%,
and...
I'm seeing a head shake.
Um...
Herjavec: Richard,
the longer you stand there ??
You already lost one offer.
You could lose both.
$700,000 ??
To who?
To my dream team over here.
For 15%, and have
the credit facility available.
I think 15% for both of us
is tough.
Okay, so,
can you counter?
?No.
?Because what I said was ??
They said no, Richard.
They said no.
O'Leary:
You really got to decide.
Neither of these deals
are gonna change.
What are you
going to do?
[ Sighs, claps ]
Let me say thank you very much
for your offer.
?Thank you.
?It was very creative.
It's a once?in?a?lifetime
opportunity,
and I recognize that.
It's more equity
than I want to give up,
but the $2 million in financing
and more if I need it, right?
It's basically ??
As long as those
are legit PO's...
Right. Legit PO's
from legit retailers...
Right.
It's way more equity
for not enough money.
What am I gonna do?
Mark and Lori...
Let's do it.
?Ah!
?Mazel tov!
[ Indistinct cheering ]
John:
That's a tough one!
[ Sighs ]
Oh!
Oh, my gosh.
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my gosh.
?Congrats, buddy.
?Okay. Thanks, guys.
Cheers.
Brutal.
Just brutal.
Made a deal!
Whoo!
Aah!
Yeah!
I feel unbelievable.
Mark and Lori were exactly the
two Sharks I were looking for,
and they came in,
and they were excited.
I'm excited.
We're all excited!
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]
