My name's Melissa Gersin,
and I'm from Boston.
How do we turn it on,
Melissa?
Yep, so in order to turn it on,
you're gonna want
to press and hold
the universal power button.
?It's a vibrating blanket.
?It's a vibrating mat, yes.
Right.
So the other button
has multiple modes.
?Oh, faster. Faster.
?So there's a medium
and then a high
and then the fourth one
is a heartbeat setting.
?Ah!
?So if you guys close your eyes
and kind of hold it like this
and take a deep breath in,
you'll feel those nice, soothing
heartbeat?type vibrations.
So, Melissa,
I have a newborn at home.
When they cry, they say
it's a couple reasons ??
gas, hungry, this and that.
But then the doctors say
after a while,
let them cry it out.
Don't answer them all the time.
?Can't do it.
Does this create a bad habit?
Oftentimes, when parents come in
and say, "My baby's crying,"
the doctor doesn't know what
to do, so they say, "It's gas.
It's acid reflux."
They just kind of ?? They're
at a loss for what to say.
?Yeah, I see. Yeah.
?Yeah.
?There's a patent on this?
?I do have a patent, yes, sir.
So it's a utility patent,
and it's based on the ??
the way that the motors
are arrayed
so that you can feel
the vibrations
throughout the entire pad.
Good for you.
?Well, have you sold any?
?Yeah.
So, we've done, um,
$65,000 in sales
in the last 7 1/2 months
through our website
as well as on Amazon.
And we've had a few boutiques
reach out to us.
That's pretty good.
What price
are you selling them at?
We currently retail this mat
for $85,
but since we've done
market testing,
we know that we can actually
sell it for about $99.
And what does it cost you
to make it?
We've narrowed it down
to about $20.
Well, I?I?I'm curious
on why you think
the company is worth
$1 million.
Well, you know, as I mentioned,
we have a patent.
We have quite a bit of sales
in just seven months time.
We plan to roll out to all moms
because moms talk to other moms.
So that's kind of our next push
within this space
and then ultimately going
to be baby?shower gift.
Can you get your price point
down, do you think?
Yes, we could, but we are trying
to go as a premium product.
One of the big things
that I stand for is safety.
Being a nurse, you know,
I take my oath to do no harm
seriously.
I don't want to get to the point
Melissa, if you really want
to make this a business,
you got to be
100% focused.
I'll give you $250,000
for 25%.
Yeah, yeah,
but she needs more money.
It's a good offer, Melissa.
Daymond has offered
pediatric nurse Melissa
$100,000 for 20%,
contingent on a licensing deal,
and Kevin has offered
$250,000 for 25%,
contingent on her leaving
her job as a nurse
to work full?time
on her vibrating baby mat
company Tranquilo.
You know, sometimes
you come into the Tank
and an offer comes, and then
you blink, and an offer goes.
And we don't want you to blink.
I think we're all waiting
to see what you do.
So 25% seems a bit high
considering the fact
that I've sold my home,
that I've blown through,
you know, my inheritance,
Melissa, you got to remember
one important thing ??
Make sure that this is what's
in the best interest
for you and the company.
I mean, if ?? if I could get
an offer that has, you know,
$200,000 for 15% equity,
I would take that in a second.
No, you've raised the value,
Melissa.
That doesn't make sense
to me.
You're saying now you want
a higher valuation
to take more cash.
I just don't want to lose
that much equity.
I mean, I've put blood, sweat ??
Well, if you want to do
$200,000, I'll do 20%.
I'm giving you the same value
and how much money you need.
We understand the hesitancy
to work with Kevin.
It's natural.
[ Chuckles ]
It's an instinct
everybody has.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
O'Leary:
Actually, I?I'm probably your
best Shark because of all ??
Hold on, let me turn
my Tranquilo mat on
so I can calm down before ??
I'm your best Shark
because I have so many
online businesses
with families and young ??
young mothers.
This does fit his wheelhouse.
It really does.
It's huge.
So, Melissa,
let's just do the math, right?
Melissa,
do you want to quit your job?
It's not even about
quitting your job, right?
No, wait.
?She answered that, Lori.
?Well, let's not ?? Let's ??
Mark, instead of you
answering for her,
let her speak for herself.
I actually ?? I mean,
I do feel that this was what
I was put on this Earth to do
was to develop this product.
So why would you want
to do anything else?
You're right, I ??
My entrepreneurs work
all day and night.
They want to.
That's why they're growing
a business.
I do want to.
John: Kevin, I have a feeling
that she just doesn't want
to do the deal with you.
?No, that's ??
?Well, you should say that.
That ?? No, that's not the case.
I'm just ?? I'm ??
I'm just curious with
the other Sharks, you know,
if there's any ??
Herjavec: So, Melissa,
Kevin's offer
is $200,000 for 20%.
Mm?hmm.
You're saying if you got
$200,000 for 15% ??
I would take that in a second
and ?? and walk right now.
Herjavec:
Well, Melissa, first of all,
I want to thank you
for being a nurse.
I think it's one of those jobs
that people work
incredibly hard for
and never get
the recognition.
You're an American hero,
and I very much appreciate it.
Thank you.
Um, I think
it's a great product.
And better
than the product,
I think you're a great
businesswoman.
We've thrown
a lot of stuff at you,
and I think you're gonna
make this work.
?Congratulations, Melissa.
?Hopefully you can, uh ??
You can use this
to calm yourself.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah!
She didn't like you!
I love her even more!
She didn't like you!
I love her even more!
[ Chuckles ]
To get a deal today ??
It really validates
what I've done.
