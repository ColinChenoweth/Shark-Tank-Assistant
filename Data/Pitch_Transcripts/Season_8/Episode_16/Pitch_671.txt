How do we turn it on,
Melissa?
Yep, so in order to turn it on,
So, Melissa,
I have a newborn at home.
When they cry, they say
it's a couple reasons ??
Melissa, if you really want
to make this a business,
you got to be
100% focused.
I'll give you $250,000
for 25%.
Yeah, yeah,
but she needs more money.
It's a good offer, Melissa.
Daymond has offered
pediatric nurse Melissa
$100,000 for 20%,
contingent on a licensing deal,
Melissa, you got to remember
one important thing ??
Make sure that this is what's
in the best interest
No, you've raised the value,
Melissa.
That doesn't make sense
to me.
You're saying now you want
a higher valuation
to take more cash.
I just don't want to lose
that much equity.
I mean, I've put blood, sweat ??
Well, if you want to do
$200,000, I'll do 20%.
So, Melissa,
let's just do the math, right?
Melissa,
do you want to quit your job?
It's not even about
quitting your job, right?
No, wait.
?She answered that, Lori.
?Well, let's not ?? Let's ??
Mark, instead of you
answering for her,
let her speak for herself.
I actually ?? I mean,
I do feel that this was what
I was put on this Earth to do
was to develop this product.
So why would you want
to do anything else?
Herjavec: So, Melissa,
Kevin's offer
is $200,000 for 20%.
Mm?hmm.
You're saying if you got
$200,000 for 15% ??
Herjavec:
Well, Melissa, first of all,
I want to thank you
for being a nurse.
I think it's one of those jobs
that people work
incredibly hard for
?Congratulations, Melissa.
?Hopefully you can, uh ??
You can use this
to calm yourself.
[ Laughter ]
Yeah!
She didn't like you!
I love her even more!
She didn't like you!
I love her even more!
[ Chuckles ]
To get a deal today ??
It really validates
what I've done.
