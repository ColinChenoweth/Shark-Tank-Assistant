I'm here seeking $100,000
for a 10% stake
in my company Tranquilo.
Have you ever wondered
why the first thing
a baby does
when they're born is to cry?
It's because they've just lost
by mimicking what
they've experienced in the womb.
But constantly rocking your baby
in your arms is exhausting,
so I developed
the Tranquilo mat,
the best possible way to
calm any crying baby in seconds.
where I'm making
a product cheaply
that is not safe.
How did you come up
with this idea?
When I came up with this idea,
I was actually in the hospital,
How much are you making,
Melissa, as a nurse right now?
Like $1,000 a month, maybe.
?How much?
?$1,000.
Wow.
You got to be full?time on this
if it's gonna fly.
I am.
I'm working 80 hours a week
with 8 hours a week
as a nurse occasionally.
Yeah, but the thing is
if you really want
to make this a business,
you got to stop working.
How much of your own money
do you have in this?
Yeah, so I'm $198,000
into this process.
?Wow!
?Wow!
Wow.
Where'd you get that money?
So I actually had
a bit of an inheritance.
?You spent your inheritance?
?Uh, I did.
Yeah.
Good for you.
You've got to stop working.
You've got to be 100%.
Kevin's getting smart.
That's enough capital
to get you going.
Replace your salary,
So you're giving her
the same value she's asking for.
It's exactly what you were
looking for in terms of value.
Greiner:
It's an amazing offer, frankly.
Kevin knows he's got
all the Honeymoon,
But you came in asking
for $100,000 for 10%, correct?
It's that equity peace again.
[ Chuckles ]
So...
O'Leary:
Would you quit your job or not?
'Cause I actually
won't do the deal unless
you quit your job.
Yeah, of course.
I would quit my job.
Working with Mark
is a company's dream scenario.
You have this amazing
business mind
that you can really call upon
every week if you need to.
My name's Renee Wallace.
Dale:
We decided to start a business
I've always had a passion
for making natural products,
?[ Chuckles ]
?My name is Dale King.
I like short shorts.
I love freedom.
My name is Renee Wallace,
We are seeking $75,000
for 15% of our business.
Sharks,
life is a contact sport,
Dale:
Even you, Mr. Wonderful.
Think of all the countless
paper cuts you've had to endure
while counting
your $100 bills.
That all changes now
with Doc Spartan's
combat?ready ointment,
a completely all?natural,
fast?healing first?aid ointment
trusted by members of
the special operations community
all the way
to neighborhood moms.
Now, Sharks,
the only issue remains ??
Who's ready to join us
on our mission to heal
America's wounds?
We'd love to give you
some samples.
O'Leary: Yeah.
Yeah,
why are your shorts so short?
?Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
?What's that sticking out?
That would be freedom
sticking out, Mark, but...
[ Laughter ]
Unfortunately, Barbara ??
Barbara's not here,
but I'm heeding her advice
when she said
if you want to get attention,
wear a short skirt
with bright colors.
So this is all I had
at the moment.
Herjavec: So, Dale,
what does the product do?
How do I use it?
What's it for?
So it's more of a,
"What doesn't it do?"
It's a completely all?natural
first?aid ointment.
Everything
that is inside that product
came from our community.
Dale: So we're not in any
big?chain retailers yet,
but if you were to go,
it would be
in the ??
in the first?aid aisle.
Herjavec: So, Dale, you're not
selling retail today, you said.
You're only selling online,
I take it.
We're ?? We're ??
75% of our sales
comes from
our e?commerce website.
However, we are
in other independent gyms.
We're in tattoo shops.
We haven't even talked about
the tattoo?shop application yet.
What are your sales today?
We've been in business
11 months ?? $56,000.
What does it sell for?
What does it cost you to make?
it's kind of scary?looking.
?Sure.
?Like, you look at this ??
?I like it.
?With a partner like you,
that's why we're here ??
Good for you.
Good for you, Dale.
Stick to your guns, Dale.
It's ?? It's worth it on that.
Stick to your guns.
First beer's on you?
Yeah.
Ohh, let's do it!
[ Laughs ]
Let's do it!
Deal.
All right.
Let's do it!
?Come here, man.
?Congratulations, guys.
Ohh! Holy crap!
You don't know
how much this means, man.
?You don't know. This is ??
?Good luck, guys.
Oh, my God, we did it.
I got to get a pair
of those shorts.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Yes!
Whoo!
We're just two podunks
from Ohio.
Uh, it's incredible.
It's such a feeling of relief.
What Robert saw in us
was a belief.
He saw two people willing
to make it happen
I mean,
working with those people,
what you really see
is why social enterprise
is the future of business.
The only way to do sustainable
community development
is help everyone involved
make money.
?They speak English there?
?They speak Saramaccan.
uh, which you have dedicated
yourself to taking on,
but I just don't have any
interest in this, so I'm out.
Fair enough.
I appreciate your ?? your input.
I'm a big believer in
social enterprise, all right?
I appreciate that.
I think it's the future
of capitalism.
I agree.
but I'm still working really
hard to make this a success.
I'm building Peaceful Fruits
to make a difference
for the people in Akron,
the people in the Amazon.
So it's disappointing to not get
that immediate bump up today,
but I know
we're gonna get there.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a product made from gear
that protects firefighters
on the front line.
by people asking me
where they could get one.
Oh, good,
so you just started making it.
It's all sweat equity.
?She just started making it.
So because you double ??
You're taking money
not to buy inventory,
not to buy cost of goods,
You're trying to gear up.
So you're thinking ??
?We're trying to gear up.
?I'm gearing up.
Okay, we got that.
But I can make these bags
a lot cheaper.
How?
These come from something
that's already constructed.
That's why it's taking
so long.
But I'm going to have
another service
It is working.
?... you're gonna go ?? Wait.
I'm knocking myself off.
That's what I'm gonna do.
So we'll pass that savings
on to the consumer.
No, no. The whole reason ??
Do you know how compelled
people are to support you
because
you're supporting firemen?
Hang on. Hang on, Kevin.
Cuban:
It's a fine line, guys.
It's a fine line
to walk between ??
It's not.
He's knocking me off!
Why can't I knock me off?!
Different business.
Different business.
?Different company.
?It is not.
Look, no, they're wrong.
Niki. Niki.
?I'm right. You're wrong, Cuban.
?They are wrong!
They only want
to loan you money...
Those guys
are taking advantage ??
...unless you don't need it.
I'm not a bank.
I'm an investor.
So what I want to do
is build businesses, okay?
This is what
this money will do.
?It will build this business.
?No, it's ?? it's not ??
You're not ready
for my $250,000, Niki.
?Okay. All right.
?I'm sorry.
I have ??
?I respect your opinion.
But, Niki,
we're not kicking you out.
?Right, that would ??
?We want you to stay,
?Bye. Thank you.
?Well, we'll be talking.
?Okay.
?[ Chuckles ]
Oh, my gosh, baby.
Oh, my God!
That was awesome!
That was brutal.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God!
Awesome!
That was so crazy!
Oh, my gosh.
I decided to go with Lori today
because she voiced
my vision for the company.
She saw the market.
She agreed.
