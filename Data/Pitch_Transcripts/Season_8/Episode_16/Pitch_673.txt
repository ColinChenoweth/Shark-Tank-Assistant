My name is Evan Delahanty
coming to you from Akron, Ohio.
I'm the founder
of Peaceful Fruits,
Evan, you are
one impressive dude.
I got to tell you.
Well,
I appreciate you saying it.
Yeah. Wow, that's ??
But you already said you're out.
[ Laughter ]
I did.
It hurts.
It hurts.
?Let's talk about the numbers.
?Uh, what are your costs?
So I sell it wholesale
for 85 cents,
?So true, Evan.
?But ?? But if we don't
figure out how to take care
of our communities
at the same time,
we're gonna lose
places to spend that money.
Not just that, but
it's communicating that story.
Evan, I love the story, but
we're back in America now, okay?
We are.
You know, your deal ??
$75,000 for 20% is not crazy,
but it's not enough money
to roll this puppy out.
Well, I'm happy to think bigger
if you want to ??
want to make an offer.
I say respectfully not for me.
I'm out.
Well,
I appreciate you saying that.
Thank you very much.
Evan, you are
a great entrepreneur.
Thank you for saying so.
The only problem here is
your competition in the arena
is huge.
There's a million
fruit snacks out there ??
strips, rolls, bites.
?Evan, thank you very much.
?I really ??
?Good luck, Evan.
?Thank you, Evan.
?Good luck.
?Thank you.
We didn't get that deal,
