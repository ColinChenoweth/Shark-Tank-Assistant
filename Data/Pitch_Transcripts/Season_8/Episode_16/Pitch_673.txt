I'm here seeking $100,000
for a 10% stake
in my company Tranquilo.
Have you ever wondered
why the first thing
a baby does
when they're born is to cry?
It's because they've just lost
the safety and security
of the womb ??
the only thing
they've ever known.
I'm a maternity nurse
and an infant?crying specialist.
I know the secret to stop
any fussy baby's wails.
The trick is to activate
a baby's calming response
by mimicking what
they've experienced in the womb.
But constantly rocking your baby
in your arms is exhausting,
so I developed
the Tranquilo mat,
the best possible way to
calm any crying baby in seconds.
And, most importantly,
it really works.
[ <i>Baby crying</i> ]
?[ Chuckles ]
?Mm.
[ <i>Crying stops</i> ]
[ Laughter ]
[ <i>Crying</i> ]
?Ohh.
?Aw!
[ <i>Coos</i> ]
John: [ Laughs ]
Cuban: Yeah.
That's great.
?You have one big enough for me?
?Yeah.
[ Light laughter ]
And when you're done,
Tranquilo mat fits nicely
into any diaper bag.
With a waterproof interior
and a washable cover,
it can withstand any mess.
We're ready to save the sanity
of parents around the globe.
So, Sharks, are you ready
to invest
in this incredible product?
Can we see it?
John: Yeah.
Yes, of course.
where I'm making
a product cheaply
that is not safe.
How did you come up
with this idea?
When I came up with this idea,
I was actually in the hospital,
and I had three fussy babies
that were all undergoing
medical treatment,
and I couldn't pick them up
to hold them.
So my colleague said,
"You really need to offer this
to the hospital
because you work here.
You know, you need to offer it."
It's like their proprietary
information.
So I offered it to them,
and one of the things
they came back
and said quite quickly
afterwards was,
"Nah, we're not interested
in pursuing this with you,"
what have you.
?Why?
?And ??
It was some guy in an office
who really didn't see the value.
However,
once we became produced,
the nurses
that I used to work with
were some of
our first customers.
How much are you making,
Melissa, as a nurse right now?
Like $1,000 a month, maybe.
?How much?
?$1,000.
Wow.
You got to be full?time on this
if it's gonna fly.
I am.
I'm working 80 hours a week
with 8 hours a week
as a nurse occasionally.
Yeah, but the thing is
if you really want
to make this a business,
you got to stop working.
How much of your own money
do you have in this?
Yeah, so I'm $198,000
into this process.
?Wow!
?Wow!
Wow.
Where'd you get that money?
So I actually had
a bit of an inheritance.
?You spent your inheritance?
?Uh, I did.
Yeah.
Good for you.
Um, I'm pretty sure
my grandfather
would be very proud of me.
Good for you.
Um, and also, um,
I sold my home.
?Whoa! You're all?in.
?So I d??
I?I am all?in to this.
You know what,
I've got an offer.
You've got to stop working.
You've got to be 100%.
Kevin's getting smart.
That's enough capital
to get you going.
Replace your salary,
and you can build
some inventory
'cause I actually think
it's an eloquent solution
to a perpetual problem.
So you're giving her
the same value she's asking for.
It's exactly what you were
looking for in terms of value.
Greiner:
It's an amazing offer, frankly.
Kevin knows he's got
all the Honeymoon,
the Honeyfund, and all that.
No, this means
there must be something.
And once they get pregnant,
he can sell it to them.
O'Leary:
Mark is right.
I have a massive database
of people that are
gonna buy this,
and you know what,
I love love.
I love babies.
I can't stand crying babies.
Anybody else?
Any other offers?
Honestly, I think he gave you
a great offer.
He's giving you basically
what you asked for,
but he's giving you more money.
But you have to give up
a lot more equity.
Which is smart in this case.
Greiner: So the questions is
does that sound appealing
to you?
Because, you know,
sometimes you come into the Tank
and an offer comes,
and then you blink,
and an offer goes.
And we don't want you to blink.
and I'm still working.
It's exactly
the same valuation.
I just asked you
if you needed more money.
Cuban: You're getting
cash for it.
But you came in asking
for $100,000 for 10%, correct?
It's that equity peace again.
[ Chuckles ]
So...
O'Leary:
Would you quit your job or not?
'Cause I actually
won't do the deal unless
you quit your job.
Yeah, of course.
I would quit my job.
[ Voice breaking ]
And it means that that ??
that hundred ?? that money
wasn't for nothing ??
that I ?? that I have
a great idea,
that I have a great product,
and that we can ??
we can do this.
Narrator: In season seven,
military wives Lisa Bradley
and Cameron Cruse
made a deal with Mark Cuban
for their bag company
R. Riveter,
which gives jobs
to fellow military spouses.
You are a social network
through action.
I mean, you could be
the future of ??
of manufacturing,
in some respects,
Narrator:
Let's see how they're doing now.
Lisa:
The year before "Shark Tank,"
we did $300,000 in sales.
It's been five months
since we aired,
and we've already done
$1.1 million in sales.
Cameron: The increase in sales
was really exciting,
but it was also kind of scary
because we knew
that at that point,
we were gonna have to start
fulfilling those orders.
As military spouses,
we have our own battles.
We may not be the ones
that have the uniform,
but we are doing
everything that we can
to support
our service member
so that they can do
the things that they need to do
to protect our country.
$1.1 million.
That's what it's all about.
Working with Mark
is a company's dream scenario.
You have this amazing
business mind
that you can really call upon
every week if you need to.
Expanding with Westfield
has been great.
One of the most exciting things
coming up for R. Riveter
is our partnership
with Westfield Mall.
We're opening up
our first retail store
in Bethesda, Maryland.
Part of your next
weekly report ??
put together what you feel
your biggest challenges
are gonna be at the store.
Obviously, we'll be able
to help you out with that.
All right, perfect.
We'll get that to you next week.
Appreciate it, guys.
See you later.
Lisa: R. Riveter really created
a new way of manufacturing.
It's not just about going
to the store and buying a bag
because it has
a certain name on it.
Our customers are buying
our bags
because it's helping
military spouses.
It's the process
of being an American
and being proud
of who we are.
Green light.
Go.
Cameron:
What I get to do is show
my kids and my husband
that we've grown something
that's now helping
dozens and dozens of military
spouses across the country,
and my kids can really see
the full picture
of the American dream.
My name's Renee Wallace.
And I'm
her business partner, Dale.
And we live
in Portsmouth, Ohio.
I was a military
intelligence officer,
and I was fortunate enough
to be assigned
to the 10th
Special Forces Group.
I was in active duty
from 2003 to 2007,
and I served
two deployments to Iraq.
Dale:
We decided to start a business
to provide jobs
and heal our local economy.
Dale and I met
when I became a member
at the gym five years ago.
I've always had a passion
for making natural products,
and after I met Dale,
we came together
to create something
that we could sell
to the members of the gym.
There's no doubt in my mind
Portsmouth's coming back.
We're coming on "Shark Tank"
'cause we want to show people
the American dream is alive
in a small town.
Whoo!
Whoo!
?[ Chuckles ]
?My name is Dale King.
I like short shorts.
I love freedom.
And I believe
in the American dream.
My name is Renee Wallace,
and although Dale believes
he's the beauty,
I'm definitely the brains
of our company, Doc Spartan.
We are seeking $75,000
for 15% of our business.
Sharks,
life is a contact sport,
and war wounds
are a part of the game.
Think of all the times
you or a loved one
have encountered nicks,
cuts, scrapes, wounds,
rashes, burns,
and even scars.
Daymond, as a gym owner,
think of all the times
your members are ripping their
hands or busting their shins
during the course
of their intense workouts.
Lori, think of all the nasty
curling?iron burns
you suffered
while prepping to go on to QVC.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughing ] I have.
Dale:
Even you, Mr. Wonderful.
Think of all the countless
paper cuts you've had to endure
while counting
your $100 bills.
That all changes now
with Doc Spartan's
combat?ready ointment,
a completely all?natural,
fast?healing first?aid ointment
trusted by members of
the special operations community
all the way
to neighborhood moms.
Now, Sharks,
the only issue remains ??
Who's ready to join us
on our mission to heal
America's wounds?
We'd love to give you
some samples.
O'Leary: Yeah.
Yeah,
why are your shorts so short?
?Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
?What's that sticking out?
That would be freedom
sticking out, Mark, but...
[ Laughter ]
Unfortunately, Barbara ??
Barbara's not here,
but I'm heeding her advice
when she said
if you want to get attention,
wear a short skirt
with bright colors.
So this is all I had
at the moment.
Herjavec: So, Dale,
what does the product do?
How do I use it?
What's it for?
So it's more of a,
"What doesn't it do?"
It's a completely all?natural
first?aid ointment.
Everything
that is inside that product
came from our community.
?And what's your community?
?I come from Portsmouth, Ohio.
I went away to serve some time
in the military.
I was an Army
intelligence officer.
I served a couple deployments
to Iraq, uh, did my time,
and was fortunate enough
to come back to my hometown.
And our area had become
the most depressed
and most economically depressed
and unhealthiest area
in the state.
I wanted to try to do something
to make that better,
so what I did is
I?I created a gym.
[ Chuckles ]
I found
an abandoned warehouse
and charged
5 bucks a workout.
That's how Renee and I met
was through that
abandoned warehouse at the time.
?You guys are business partners.
?Yes, absolutely. Yeah.
So, how does
Doc Spartan's come to fruition?
Well, um,
I'm a mom of three,
and I'm married
to a former Kiowa pilot
who served 10 years
in the Army.
I had a little girl,
and I started researching
the benefits of essential oils
because I didn't want
to use chemicals
on myself and my daughter.
And so I started making
my own skin?care products.
So Dale then approached me
and asked me
if I could work on creating
a healing ointment
for when we rip our hands.
It's 'cause you're not using
the Natural Grip.
You were trying to heal hands.
[ Laughter ]
Well, we do sell those
in our gym, Robert.
Tell me the applications,
where I would use this.
Any type of skin?related
ailment, it's gonna work.
?How about a cut?
?Cuts?
Do I put it on
before a Band?Aid?
Absolutely.
It accelerates healing.
We'd love to show you
some before?and?afters.
Oh. Okay.
?Whoa!
?Whoa!
?So, yeah.
?So this is scar healing.
Nothing else was on that?
You didn't use any type of ??
Nothing else was on it.
This was
a 50?year?old mother
who had to get
a knee?replacement surgery.
This is about six
or seven months afterwards.
Tell me what's in it.
It's coconut oil, beeswax,
Vitamin E, sweet almond oil,
and then essential oils
lavender, eucalyptus,
and tea tree.
And you ?? you put
all that mixture together
just by trial and error?
Yeah, yeah.
Just based ??
Well, they're also
known medicinals.
Yeah.
Tell me
where in the drugstore
is the ideal position
for this product?
Dale: So we're not in any
big?chain retailers yet,
but if you were to go,
it would be
in the ??
in the first?aid aisle.
Herjavec: So, Dale, you're not
selling retail today, you said.
You're only selling online,
I take it.
We're ?? We're ??
75% of our sales
comes from
our e?commerce website.
However, we are
in other independent gyms.
We're in tattoo shops.
We haven't even talked about
the tattoo?shop application yet.
What are your sales today?
We've been in business
11 months ?? $56,000.
What does it sell for?
What does it cost you to make?
That costs 95 cents to make,
and we sell it for $9.99.
And then the big tin costs us
$1.70 to make,
and we sell it for $14.99.
Guys,
here's why I've been quiet.
If you watch the show, you know
I get a little bit freaked out
when people make
a lot of claims.
?Absolutely.
?When you say,
"I've got a cure
for that," right?
"This happened.
We're a cure."
It works when you're small
because no one's
paying attention to you yet.
Mm?hmm.
But in order to scale,
you have to be really careful
about your claims.
With your investment,
we're gonna be able
to go get those tests.
it's kind of scary?looking.
?Sure.
?Like, you look at this ??
?I like it.
?With a partner like you,
that's why we're here ??
for ?? for this advice
and suggestions and to ??
You need to have already
figured this out, right?
This needed to be part
of your research.
This needed to be part
of your preparation.
I don't think you've done
the preparatory work
that you need to,
so for those reasons, I'm out.
Lori is the person here
who really is the expert
in regards to testing
and claims.
I don't know about
any of this testing,
so I would be the blind
leading the blind.
So I have to be out.
Greiner:
I thank you for your service,
and I think that you've done
a good job in formulating.
?Thank you.
?To me,
you have a long road ahead
because you have
a lot of competition.
But you have
a good quality product.
?Thank you, Lori.
?I'm out.
Good for you.
Good for you, Dale.
Stick to your guns, Dale.
It's ?? It's worth it on that.
Stick to your guns.
First beer's on you?
Yeah.
Ohh, let's do it!
[ Laughs ]
Let's do it!
Deal.
All right.
Let's do it!
?Come here, man.
?Congratulations, guys.
Ohh! Holy crap!
You don't know
how much this means, man.
?You don't know. This is ??
?Good luck, guys.
Oh, my God, we did it.
I got to get a pair
of those shorts.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Yes!
Whoo!
We're just two podunks
from Ohio.
Uh, it's incredible.
It's such a feeling of relief.
What Robert saw in us
was a belief.
He saw two people willing
to make it happen
and willing to work
their asses off to get it done.
I mean,
working with those people,
what you really see
is why social enterprise
is the future of business.
The only way to do sustainable
community development
is help everyone involved
make money.
?They speak English there?
?They speak Saramaccan.
26,000 people in the world
and this guy
speak that language,
so great résumé skill.
Tell us something
in Saramaccan.
[ Speaks Saramaccan ]
Ha!
?Wow!
?Thank you.
I just ?? I just said, uh,
"What do you want me to say?
I think you should buy
some acai."
?Wow.
?Wow.
uh, which you have dedicated
yourself to taking on,
but I just don't have any
interest in this, so I'm out.
Fair enough.
I appreciate your ?? your input.
I'm a big believer in
social enterprise, all right?
I appreciate that.
I think it's the future
of capitalism.
I agree.
Capitalism's evolving,
and there's a lot of people
who are confused
and getting left behind.
Absolutely.
But still, the product
has to be compelling.
Mm?hmm. What I think really sets
us apart is the story, right?
You have the acai.
You have the super food,
which is a big differentiator.
But the social enterprise
should come with the product
that you want to buy...
I agree.
...as opposed to be the reason
why you buy the product.
Absolutely.
It's the extra hook.
Right?
Right. That's the challenge
you have here.
I don't know that
it's going to be an easy sale.
You're going to have to go
through that branding process,
and the risk?reward
just isn't there for me.
?I hear you on that.
?So for those reasons, I'm out.
I?I hear you on that,
and I think this is the future
of business, right?
We have to figure out
how to make money.
That's the number?one goal
of business, but ??
but I'm still working really
hard to make this a success.
I'm building Peaceful Fruits
to make a difference
for the people in Akron,
the people in the Amazon.
So it's disappointing to not get
that immediate bump up today,
but I know
we're gonna get there.
Narrator: Next into the Tank
is a product made from gear
that protects firefighters
on the front line.
and I'm here seeking
a $250,000 investment
for 33% of my company.
Sharks, I've been a firefighter
for 13 years,
and on every shift I work,
I wear this turnout gear.
Firefighters wear this gear
to protect ourselves
from the dangerous elements
we face in doing our job.
Typically, every firefighter
is issued two sets,
and we use those two sets
for 10 years.
We then turn in those two sets
and get two new sets.
And this creates a unique
problem for fire departments ??
what to do
with all this old gear.
by people asking me
where they could get one.
And that's how Fire Fighter
Turn?Out Bags was born.
Now we have every type of bag
you can imagine.
So, Sharks,
who wants to be
the hero of Fire Fighter
Turn?Out Bags
and make
a smoking?hot offer?!
[ Laughter ]
?Good job.
?Can we see samples?
Good job!
I'm on "Shark Tank"!
I'm on "Shark Tank"!
Cuban: Oh, Lord.
I'm on "Shark Tank"!
I'm on "Shark Tank"!
We do that every day.
Sorry.
I can't contain myself.
Greiner: [ Laughs ]
All right.
Which one is for Lori?
Woman: You can take
any bag you would like.
Here, Kevin.
Black for you.
Niki, how long did it take you
to get on "Shark Tank"?
It took me years.
But you know what, it taught me
that I am in this on my own...
It's very cool.
...and not to rely
on anything or anyone.
Wow.
Never take the first note.
How do you scale it?
You know, one of the things
about getting on "Shark Tank" ??
If you do a great pitch
and people like it,
you're gonna get
10,000 orders.
So how many suits
are you getting
out of the fireman system?
Fire departments don't want
to throw this stuff away.
Well, if they don't want
to throw it away,
what do they want
to do with it?
What do they do with it?
Currently,
it just goes in the landfill.
?Really?
?Or they store it. Yes.
I get calls every day
by a fire department
wanting me to take
their old gear.
What does it cost
to make one of these bags,
and what do you sell it at?
And where do you make it,
and how do you make it?
My business is operated
in my basement.
We were in a factory.
I tried to kind of compact it
and make it work for my life,
and it was not doing that.
It was expanding and expanding.
?You mean you went to a factory,
and it was too much?
?You went in a factory?
?It was overwhelming.
?I was ?? I got a warehouse,
and it was taking over
my life.
So I said, "This is too much.
I'm gonna scale down."
And it did not
scale down with me.
It did its own thing,
and it got bigger.
And so now I need
to get back into a warehouse.
But why do you want to go
back to the warehouse?
I didn't know what
I didn't know back then.
I didn't know how to set up
a manufacturing facility.
I didn't understand
the electrical I needed.
I didn't know
how to manage people.
There was a lot
of mistakes I made,
and they were all
very expensive.
What does it cost you,
and what do you sell them for?
?Okay.
?Okay, so...
?Hold on.
?Go ahead.
And, Niki, at some point,
you can tell us
how much you sold
last year.
We make ??
We grossed $194,000.
?Good for you.
?Yeah.
?So you sold...
?And we profited ??
We profited $70,000.
How much money
have you guys invested?
We haven't invested
any of our own personal money.
Oh, good,
so you just started making it.
It's all sweat equity.
?She just started making it.
It's paying
for itself and ??
?How are you raising capital?
?How much are you spending?
Wait.
What does a bag cost?
I'm dying to know.
Yeah,
how much does this bag ??
The average bag is $130.
That's your cost?
That bag costs me
about $60 to make.
Whoa!
Well, how much
is a duffel bag?
$350.
?Whoa.
?Wow.
I smell a requirement
for capital.
What have you borrowed?
There is a huge requirement,
and I have taken out
a couple of loans.
O'Leary: How much?
I have $40,000
in, um, high?interest loans.
How high interest?
Here's a ??
Here's the highest?interest
loan that I have.
Okay.
I borrowed $20,000.
Uh, if I take seven months
to pay it back,
it's gonna cost me $30,000.
That's 50% interest.
I don't regret doing that.
I needed that money.
You're a wonderful lady
with lots of energy,
but you need a manager.
Somebody in here
has to take over and say,
"I do care about the logistics.
I do care about the cost
of rent," all right?
The truth is I don't think
of you as a great manager.
Oh, you don't?
I think of you
as a great inventor.
I am a slam?dunk manager.
I don't think so, Niki.
Every employee that I have
loves their job.
I don't think
I'm a bad manager.
I look at you ??
I've heard your story.
It's very compelling.
But it's very hard
for me to understand
how to deploy $250,000
and ever have a hope
of getting it back.
Something's not adding up for me
numbers?wise.
If you made $70,000
in free cash flow last year,
why did you have to take
a $40,000 loan now?
Well ??
Can I answer one thing?
Yes.
We ??
Just in the last month,
We've kind of, like,
doubled our ??
our ?? our payroll.
Work force.
So because you double ??
You're taking money
not to buy inventory,
not to buy cost of goods,
but to expand the business.
You're trying to gear up.
So you're thinking ??
?We're trying to gear up.
?I'm gearing up.
Okay, we got that.
But I can make these bags
a lot cheaper.
How?
These come from something
that's already constructed.
That's why it's taking
so long.
But I'm going to have
another service
where I get these bags
and I stamp the pattern out.
What?
All of the material
is on a roll.
I do it the way
normal people do it.
?Okay, it's not ??
?No, no. That's authentic.
I don't think that's gonna work.
That's not gonna work.
?Wait, what you're saying is...
?Why isn't it gonna work?
It is working.
?... you're gonna go ?? Wait.
Let me see
if I understand this.
That's not an
authentic product, then.
?No.
?You're gonna go to mass?produce
the look of these,
but take regular fabric,
and then ??
?Well, they're gonna be ??
?No, it's ?? it's gonna be
the actual fabric that they use.
?Just fireman fabric.
It's gonna be off a roll.
Now, listen ??
You know, Niki, I think that's
a very dangerous place to go.
75% of the fire fighters ??
?No.
?This bag fought fires.
O'Leary:
That's what you told me.
That's why I pay
300 bucks for it.
This was on the back
of a fireman.
John: Yeah.
?You're changing your ??
?No, I'm not.
We're gonna offer ??
We're gonna offer both.
Huge mistake.
One's gonna be a lot less
expensive to manufacture.
I'm knocking myself off.
That's what I'm gonna do.
So we'll pass that savings
on to the consumer.
No, no. The whole reason ??
Do you know how compelled
people are to support you
because
you're supporting firemen?
Hang on. Hang on, Kevin.
Cuban:
It's a fine line, guys.
It's a fine line
to walk between ??
It's not.
People are already doing it,
and they're selling.
I've seen it.
?I know, but let me ??
let me ?? let me tell you
what I think about it.
First of all, this bag
is absolutely incredible.
?Yeah, it's great.
?From the way you sewed it,
I can see people
paying the money for it.
Thank you.
But I think
what we're sharing with you
is not that you're not
a good manager.
You could be a <i>great</i> manager,
but it's gonna take me to not
only give you an investment
but send a huge team in to ship,
bill, and everything ??
to grow the business.
But at this stage,
it's hard for us to invest in.
And unfortunately,
I have to be out.
?[ Scoffs ]
?Look.
As Kevin said, it's not that
it looks like a fireman wore it.
It's the fact that a fireman
actually wore it.
Right.
The whole deal is
somebody wore this.
That's the whole deal.
?That's not the whole deal.
You're missing it, Kevin.
?No, it's not. No, look. I ??
?I've been to trade shows.
?I think so.
Look, I can have my opinion.
We don't have to agree, okay?
I've been to trade shows,
and there's this guy.
He had a booth.
He's getting
all his stuff from China.
It's generic,
and there's no soul to it.
Well, then you should get
a manufacturer in China
to take that material
and knock that bag off.
Hold on.
Just let me get this across.
He's knocking me off!
Why can't I knock me off?!
Different business.
Different business.
?Different company.
?It is not.
Look, no, they're wrong.
Niki. Niki.
?I'm right. You're wrong, Cuban.
?They are wrong!
?You're wrong.
?And I'm gonna explain to you ??
Well, then,
you give her the money.
I'm gonna explain
to you why, right?
Lots of companies
have premium brands
that are authentic,
and then they have
less?expensive versions
to reach a broader audience.
Where do you think she's gonna
get the capacity to do that?
That's a different issue.
She can't even build the ones
she's got orders for.
That ??
That's a different issue, right?
[ Scoffs ]
That's not true.
Look, Niki, you should
be extremely proud of yourself.
You're ?? You're hustling.
You're hitting it hard, right?
You're doing
a lot of great things.
But you're really a product,
not a company.
Okay.
That's the challenge.
And for that reason,
I'm out.
Well, Niki,
I can't invest in this,
not because you're not terrific.
It's just not structured
to take $250,000 right now.
You're just like the banks
that won't give me a loan.
?That's what ?? No, it is.
?It's not about loaning.
They only want
to loan you money...
Those guys
are taking advantage ??
...unless you don't need it.
I'm not a bank.
I'm an investor.
So what I want to do
is build businesses, okay?
This is what
this money will do.
?It will build this business.
?No, it's ?? it's not ??
You're not ready
for my $250,000, Niki.
?Okay. All right.
?I'm sorry.
I have ??
?I respect your opinion.
But, Niki,
we're not kicking you out.
?Right, that would ??
?We want you to stay,
and we'd hire you
as a designer.
I'm giving you the opportunity
to do the things you like.
?Okay.
Can I ask a question?
?Of course.
?You're allowed to talk, Niki.
W?Wh...
I don't have any questions.
I know what I need to do.
?Bye. Thank you.
?Well, we'll be talking.
?Okay.
?[ Chuckles ]
Oh, my gosh, baby.
Oh, my God!
That was awesome!
That was brutal.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God!
Awesome!
That was so crazy!
Oh, my gosh.
I decided to go with Lori today
because she voiced
my vision for the company.
She saw the market.
She agreed.
And I can't sell my company
to somebody who doesn't agree
with my vision.
